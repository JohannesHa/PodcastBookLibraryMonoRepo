00:00.200 --> 00:04.440
 If you could talk to Vladimir Putin once again now,

00:04.440 --> 00:08.460
 what kind of things would you talk about here?

00:08.460 --> 00:10.360
 What kind of questions would you ask?

00:12.740 --> 00:15.240
 The following is a conversation with Oliver Stone.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.720
 He's one of the greatest filmmakers of all time

00:17.720 --> 00:21.320
 with three Oscar wins and 11 Oscar nominations.

00:21.320 --> 00:24.840
 His films tell stories of war and power,

00:24.840 --> 00:27.240
 fearlessly and often controversially,

00:27.240 --> 00:28.840
 shining a light on the dark parts

00:28.840 --> 00:31.400
 of American and global history.

00:31.400 --> 00:34.160
 His films include Platoon, Wall Street,

00:34.160 --> 00:37.680
 Born on the 4th of July, Scarface, JFK,

00:37.680 --> 00:41.140
 Nixon, Alexander, W, Snowden,

00:41.140 --> 00:43.760
 and documentaries where he has interviewed

00:43.760 --> 00:46.420
 some of the most powerful and consequential people

00:46.420 --> 00:49.040
 in the world, including Fidel Castro,

00:49.040 --> 00:52.720
 Hugo Chavez, and Vladimir Putin.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.840
 And in this conversation, Oliver and I

00:54.840 --> 00:57.560
 mostly focus our discussion on Vladimir Putin,

00:57.560 --> 01:00.720
 Russia, and the war in Ukraine.

01:00.720 --> 01:02.300
 My goal with these conversations

01:02.300 --> 01:04.840
 is to understand the human being before me,

01:04.840 --> 01:07.280
 to understand not just what they think,

01:07.280 --> 01:10.240
 but how they think, to steel man their ideas,

01:10.240 --> 01:12.800
 and to steel man the devil's advocate,

01:12.800 --> 01:16.600
 all in service of understanding, not derision.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.720
 I have done this poorly in the past.

01:18.720 --> 01:20.560
 I'm still struggling with this,

01:20.560 --> 01:22.580
 but I'm working hard to do better.

01:23.880 --> 01:25.760
 I believe the moment we draw lines

01:25.760 --> 01:28.800
 between good people and evil people

01:28.800 --> 01:32.840
 will lose our ability to see that we're all one people

01:32.840 --> 01:35.160
 in the most fundamental of ways,

01:35.160 --> 01:37.440
 and will lose track of the deep truth

01:37.440 --> 01:40.240
 expressed by the old Solzhenitsyn line

01:40.240 --> 01:42.440
 that I return to time and time again,

01:43.360 --> 01:45.460
 that the line between good and evil

01:45.460 --> 01:47.300
 runs through the heart of every man.

01:48.720 --> 01:50.820
 Oliver Stone has a perspective

01:50.820 --> 01:52.520
 that he extensively documents

01:52.520 --> 01:54.720
 in his powerful controversial series,

01:54.720 --> 01:57.680
 The Untold History of the United States,

01:57.680 --> 02:01.800
 that imperialism and the military industrial complex

02:01.800 --> 02:04.080
 paved the path to absolute power,

02:04.080 --> 02:06.180
 and thus corrupt the minds of the leaders

02:06.180 --> 02:07.860
 and institutions that wield it.

02:08.840 --> 02:10.920
 From this perspective, the way out

02:10.920 --> 02:14.600
 of the humanitarian crisis and human suffering in Ukraine,

02:14.600 --> 02:16.600
 and the way out from the pull

02:16.600 --> 02:18.520
 of the beating drums of nuclear war

02:18.520 --> 02:20.600
 is not simple to understand,

02:20.600 --> 02:24.620
 but we must, because all of humanity hangs in the balance.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.720
 I will talk to many people who seek to understand

02:27.720 --> 02:30.060
 the way out of this growing catastrophe,

02:30.060 --> 02:32.720
 including to historians, to leaders,

02:32.720 --> 02:34.440
 and perhaps most importantly,

02:34.440 --> 02:37.640
 to people on the ground in Ukraine and Russia,

02:37.640 --> 02:39.880
 not just about war and suffering,

02:39.880 --> 02:43.360
 but about life, friendship, family, love, and hope.

02:44.760 --> 02:46.760
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

02:46.760 --> 02:48.960
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

02:48.960 --> 02:51.880
 in the description, and now, dear friends,

02:51.880 --> 02:53.580
 here's Oliver Stone.

02:54.500 --> 02:58.680
 You're working on a documentary now about nuclear energy.

02:58.680 --> 02:59.520
 Yes.

02:59.520 --> 03:01.760
 So it's interesting to talk about this.

03:01.760 --> 03:04.540
 Energy is such a big part of the world,

03:04.540 --> 03:06.440
 about geopolitics of the world,

03:06.440 --> 03:08.300
 about the way the world is.

03:08.300 --> 03:10.440
 What do you think is the role of nuclear energy

03:10.440 --> 03:11.400
 in the 21st century?

03:11.400 --> 03:12.640
 Good question, and first of all,

03:12.640 --> 03:14.960
 obviously everyone's talking about climate change, right?

03:14.960 --> 03:17.760
 So here I wake up to that a few years ago,

03:17.760 --> 03:20.460
 and clearly were concerned.

03:21.920 --> 03:25.360
 I picked up a book by Josh Goldstein

03:25.360 --> 03:27.760
 and his coauthor, who's Swedish.

03:27.760 --> 03:30.280
 Those two wrote a book called A Bright Future.

03:30.280 --> 03:33.680
 It came out a few years ago, and I lapped it up.

03:33.680 --> 03:37.980
 It was a book, fact based, clear,

03:37.980 --> 03:40.640
 not too long, and not too technical,

03:40.640 --> 03:44.040
 and it was very clear that they were in favor

03:44.040 --> 03:49.040
 of all kinds of renewables, renewable energy, yes.

03:49.320 --> 03:53.680
 They made it very clear how dangerous oil

03:53.680 --> 03:56.960
 and gas were, methane,

03:56.960 --> 03:59.840
 and made it very clear to the layman like me,

03:59.840 --> 04:02.900
 and at the same time said that these renewables

04:02.900 --> 04:06.440
 could work so far, but the gap is enormous

04:06.440 --> 04:10.120
 as to how much electricity the world is gonna need

04:10.120 --> 04:14.360
 in 2050 and beyond, two, three, four times.

04:14.360 --> 04:16.640
 We don't even know the damage, but we have India,

04:16.640 --> 04:19.380
 we have China, we have Africa, we have Asia

04:19.380 --> 04:22.920
 coming onto the scene wanting more and more electricity.

04:22.920 --> 04:25.200
 So they address the problem as a global one,

04:25.200 --> 04:27.560
 not just as often in the United States.

04:27.560 --> 04:31.000
 You get the ethnocentric United States point of view

04:31.000 --> 04:34.200
 that we know we're doing well, blah, blah, blah.

04:34.200 --> 04:37.080
 We're not doing well, but we sell that

04:37.080 --> 04:38.440
 to people that we're comfortable.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.560
 We spend more energy than anybody,

04:40.560 --> 04:44.200
 this country per capita, than anybody,

04:44.200 --> 04:47.960
 and at the same time, we don't seem to understand

04:47.960 --> 04:49.760
 the global picture, so that's what they did,

04:49.760 --> 04:50.760
 and they made me very worried.

04:50.760 --> 04:52.700
 So the only way to close that gap,

04:52.700 --> 04:55.800
 the only way in their mind is nuclear energy,

04:55.800 --> 04:58.840
 and talking about a gap of building a huge amount

04:58.840 --> 05:01.680
 of reactors over the next 30 years,

05:01.680 --> 05:08.600
 and starting now, they make that point over and over again.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.840
 So obviously this country, the United States,

05:11.840 --> 05:13.240
 is not gonna go in that direction,

05:13.240 --> 05:17.640
 because it just is incapable of having that kind of will,

05:17.640 --> 05:20.520
 political will, and fear is a huge factor,

05:20.520 --> 05:25.240
 and still a lot of shibboleths, a lot of myths

05:25.240 --> 05:29.520
 about nuclear energy have confused

05:29.520 --> 05:30.920
 and confounded the landscape.

05:30.920 --> 05:33.680
 The environmentalists have played a huge role

05:33.680 --> 05:36.080
 in doing good things, many good things,

05:36.080 --> 05:39.360
 but also confusing and confounding the landscape,

05:39.360 --> 05:41.520
 and making accusations against nuclear energy

05:41.520 --> 05:43.780
 that were exaggerated.

05:45.280 --> 05:48.360
 So taking all these things into consideration,

05:48.360 --> 05:50.100
 we set about making this documentary,

05:50.100 --> 05:53.000
 which is about finished now, almost finishing.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.080
 It's an hour and 40 minutes, and that was a hard part,

05:56.080 --> 05:58.900
 getting it down from about three and a half hours

05:58.900 --> 06:00.880
 to about this, something more manageable,

06:00.880 --> 06:02.760
 and is it interviews?

06:02.760 --> 06:04.440
 It's interviews, among others,

06:04.440 --> 06:07.200
 but essentially we went to Russia, we went to France,

06:07.200 --> 06:10.560
 which is the most, perhaps, advanced nuclear country

06:10.560 --> 06:14.180
 in the world, Russia, and the United States.

06:14.180 --> 06:16.720
 We went to the Idaho laboratory,

06:16.720 --> 06:19.840
 and talked to the scientists there,

06:19.840 --> 06:22.640
 as well as the Department of Energy people

06:22.640 --> 06:23.680
 that are handling this.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.280
 Idaho is one of the experimental labs,

06:25.280 --> 06:27.320
 the United States is probably one of the most advanced,

06:27.320 --> 06:29.960
 and they're doing a lot of advanced nuclear there.

06:29.960 --> 06:34.960
 We also, we studied, well, Russia gave us a lot of insight.

06:36.560 --> 06:37.680
 We're very cooperative,

06:37.680 --> 06:41.080
 because they have some of the most advanced nuclear,

06:41.080 --> 06:43.180
 actually the probably most advanced nuclear reactor

06:43.180 --> 06:46.440
 in the world, at Beloyarsk, at the Ural Mountains.

06:46.440 --> 06:49.740
 So we did an investigation there,

06:49.740 --> 06:54.740
 and in France they have some very advanced nuclear reactors

06:55.400 --> 06:58.400
 and they're building, and now they're building again.

06:58.400 --> 07:01.240
 The Green Party came into power,

07:01.240 --> 07:04.600
 just not into power, but became a factor in France,

07:04.600 --> 07:07.200
 and there was a motion when Hollande was president,

07:07.200 --> 07:08.920
 they started to move away from it.

07:08.920 --> 07:12.100
 Actually, they were beginning to just abandon,

07:13.360 --> 07:17.080
 they let, not complete, in other words,

07:17.080 --> 07:18.640
 close down some of the nuclear reactors,

07:18.640 --> 07:20.920
 there was talk of that, but thank God,

07:20.920 --> 07:23.720
 France did not do that, and Macron came in

07:23.720 --> 07:27.000
 and recently reversed it, reversed it,

07:27.000 --> 07:28.880
 and they're building as fast as they can now,

07:28.880 --> 07:32.200
 especially with the Ukraine war going on,

07:32.200 --> 07:36.640
 there's an awareness that Russia will not be providing,

07:36.640 --> 07:39.840
 may not be providing the energy Europe needs.

07:39.840 --> 07:42.440
 So, and then China is the other one too,

07:42.440 --> 07:45.640
 that's the other factor, I'm talking about the big boys.

07:45.640 --> 07:48.760
 They have, doing tremendous work and fast,

07:48.760 --> 07:51.040
 which is very hopeful, but of course,

07:51.040 --> 07:53.940
 China is building in all directions at once,

07:53.940 --> 07:57.120
 coal continues to be huge in China,

07:57.120 --> 08:01.920
 and methane too,

08:01.920 --> 08:05.240
 but basically coal, coal in India, in China,

08:05.240 --> 08:07.080
 have the biggest users of coal,

08:08.840 --> 08:13.120
 and as you know, Germany went back to coal a few years ago,

08:13.120 --> 08:16.000
 so all these factors, it's a fascinating picture globally,

08:16.000 --> 08:20.840
 so we try to achieve a consensus that where nuclear can work

08:20.840 --> 08:22.760
 and where it will be working,

08:22.760 --> 08:24.960
 where it will be used more and more,

08:24.960 --> 08:28.400
 the question is how much carbon dioxide China

08:28.400 --> 08:30.840
 and Russia will be putting out.

08:30.840 --> 08:33.240
 France is the only one that's not putting it out.

08:33.240 --> 08:34.680
 The United States has not changed,

08:34.680 --> 08:38.640
 with all the talk and all the nonsense about renewables

08:38.640 --> 08:41.400
 and the new lifestyle and all this,

08:41.400 --> 08:43.320
 it's great for your guilt complex,

08:43.320 --> 08:47.240
 but it doesn't do anything for the total accumulation

08:47.240 --> 08:48.680
 of carbon dioxide in the world.

08:48.680 --> 08:51.120
 Who's gonna lead the way on nuclear, do you think?

08:51.120 --> 08:54.080
 You mentioned Russia, France, China, United States,

08:54.080 --> 08:54.920
 who's gonna lead?

08:54.920 --> 08:56.120
 Yeah, I don't think it's gonna be

08:56.120 --> 08:58.240
 a United Nations kind of thing,

08:58.240 --> 09:01.040
 because the world doesn't seem capable of uniting.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.880
 We go to these conferences, Kyoto,

09:03.880 --> 09:06.840
 and we talk and we agree,

09:06.840 --> 09:08.400
 but then we don't actually enforce,

09:08.400 --> 09:09.740
 so I don't think it can happen that way.

09:09.740 --> 09:13.120
 I think it's gonna be an individual race with countries.

09:13.120 --> 09:16.200
 They're gonna just do it for their own self interest,

09:16.200 --> 09:18.140
 like China's doing it.

09:18.140 --> 09:21.480
 China, the thing is, if it works, and I'm praying

09:21.480 --> 09:23.680
 that it will really work on a big scale,

09:23.680 --> 09:26.240
 China will back away from coal naturally.

09:26.240 --> 09:27.960
 The same thing will be true of India.

09:27.960 --> 09:31.240
 They will see the benefits, because if you go to India,

09:31.240 --> 09:33.040
 you see the cities, the pollution.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.520
 You walk around in that stuff, and you get,

09:35.520 --> 09:39.040
 it's not, there's no hope in this, and you sense it.

09:39.040 --> 09:41.760
 So people will move in this direction naturally,

09:41.760 --> 09:44.840
 because nuclear is clean energy.

09:44.840 --> 09:48.600
 And the amount of casualties of nuclear

09:48.600 --> 09:50.800
 is the lowest on the industrial scale

09:50.800 --> 09:54.360
 for energy producing, from coal down to oil, everything.

09:54.360 --> 09:57.680
 The lowest casualty rate, very lowest,

09:57.680 --> 10:00.880
.002 or something, is nuclear.

10:00.880 --> 10:04.120
 So not that many people have died from nuclear.

10:04.120 --> 10:07.600
 Not that many, I think 50 people at Chernobyl,

10:07.600 --> 10:09.640
 which was the worst accident.

10:09.640 --> 10:12.160
 Nobody had died at Fukushima.

10:12.160 --> 10:13.820
 Nobody died at Three Mile Island,

10:13.820 --> 10:16.440
 and that's what you hear all over and over again,

10:16.440 --> 10:17.960
 these accidents.

10:19.520 --> 10:22.480
 The environmentalists have sold us the idea

10:22.480 --> 10:23.680
 that they're dangerous.

10:24.960 --> 10:27.560
 And it's, a lot of environmentalists, thank God,

10:27.560 --> 10:29.680
 are changing, they've come off that routine,

10:29.680 --> 10:32.400
 and they've saying, this, we were wrong.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.040
 We've done a lot of good work.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.480
 Greenpeace did a lot of good work.

10:35.480 --> 10:38.560
 Whale, whales, saving this, saving that.

10:38.560 --> 10:41.480
 But they admit themselves, not they don't,

10:41.480 --> 10:44.360
 but people who have been in the organization

10:44.360 --> 10:46.680
 have said, we were wrong.

10:46.680 --> 10:51.680
 In 1956, we show the articles

10:51.920 --> 10:54.080
 in the New York Times that came out,

10:54.080 --> 10:56.280
 the Rockefeller Foundation,

10:56.280 --> 11:00.360
 which of course is a big producer of oil,

11:00.360 --> 11:04.160
 the Rockefeller family, and the foundation came out

11:05.960 --> 11:09.960
 with a study, which was weighted.

11:09.960 --> 11:13.360
 They tipped the scale, put a thumb on the scale,

11:13.360 --> 11:17.440
 but it was a scientific expose of radiation

11:17.440 --> 11:22.220
 in the study that came out, printed in the New York Times,

11:22.220 --> 11:24.720
 because the New York Times publisher, Salzburger,

11:24.720 --> 11:28.080
 was on their board, he was one of the board members.

11:28.080 --> 11:32.840
 So they got a lot of strong publicity

11:32.840 --> 11:36.320
 condemning radiation, which killed,

11:36.320 --> 11:39.040
 started the process of doubting nuclear energy.

11:39.040 --> 11:40.920
 The radiation levels that they pointed out

11:40.920 --> 11:43.400
 were very minor, and of course,

11:43.400 --> 11:46.200
 if you go into a scientific analysis of this now

11:46.200 --> 11:49.120
 with what we know, it's just not true.

11:49.120 --> 11:52.280
 But it tilted the scale back in the 50s, 60s,

11:52.280 --> 11:56.520
 and started the questioning the nuclear business.

11:56.520 --> 11:59.000
 Do you think that was malevolence or incompetence?

11:59.000 --> 12:01.200
 No, I think it was competition.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.480
 I don't think it was conspiracy

12:02.480 --> 12:04.080
 as much as it was essentially,

12:04.080 --> 12:07.160
 we don't want this, nuclear energy's gonna end

12:07.160 --> 12:10.640
 the dominance of oil, absolutely, and it will.

12:10.640 --> 12:13.080
 And it will anyway, because it's the only sane way

12:13.080 --> 12:14.480
 for the world to proceed.

12:14.480 --> 12:19.420
 But the world will have to learn through adversity.

12:20.640 --> 12:23.560
 So in other words, this situation could get worse,

12:23.560 --> 12:25.920
 much worse, and certain countries

12:25.920 --> 12:28.240
 are just gonna have to adapt, like we always do.

12:28.240 --> 12:30.960
 When things become too hard, you've got to go,

12:30.960 --> 12:33.400
 you have to change your thinking.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.200
 And humans are pretty good at that.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.920
 Yes, talking about human nature, they're very adept

12:37.920 --> 12:40.080
 at that, Germany, for example.

12:40.080 --> 12:42.480
 I mean, they were, when the Fukushima happened,

12:42.480 --> 12:44.080
 they went out of the nuclear business.

12:44.080 --> 12:45.400
 That was shocking to me.

12:46.660 --> 12:49.320
 They just pulled out and they destroyed,

12:49.320 --> 12:51.440
 destructed several of their nuclear reactors

12:51.440 --> 12:54.920
 who were still functioning, and put up coal,

12:54.920 --> 12:59.360
 or yeah, put up coal and oil, replaced it.

12:59.360 --> 13:03.560
 And as a result, Germany drifted into this place

13:03.560 --> 13:07.160
 next to France, their electricity bills went up,

13:07.160 --> 13:09.500
 and France stayed the same.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.240
 They don't have that, they have a different system

13:11.240 --> 13:13.760
 in Europe, but more or less, no question that France

13:13.760 --> 13:15.840
 was doing a lot better than Germany.

13:15.840 --> 13:18.880
 And now, with this Ukraine issue,

13:18.880 --> 13:20.840
 it's a very interesting fulcrum point,

13:20.840 --> 13:25.680
 whether Germany is, what direction they're gonna go now.

13:25.680 --> 13:29.240
 How can they, how can they keep going with coal?

13:29.240 --> 13:30.080
 They just can't.

13:30.080 --> 13:35.080
 What's the connection between oil, coal, nuclear, and war?

13:36.640 --> 13:40.240
 Sort of energy and conflict.

13:41.560 --> 13:43.280
 When you look at the 21st century,

13:43.280 --> 13:45.160
 when you were doing this documentary,

13:45.160 --> 13:48.200
 were you thinking of nuclear as a way to power the world,

13:48.200 --> 13:52.480
 but is it also to avoid conflict over resources?

13:53.660 --> 13:57.120
 Is there some aspect to energy being a source of conflict

13:57.120 --> 14:02.120
 that we're trying to avoid?

14:04.360 --> 14:06.960
 I don't have the energy, the history of energy

14:06.960 --> 14:11.960
 at my fingertips, and it's a very long history here.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.520
 But I would say, apparently not.

14:15.520 --> 14:18.080
 It does seem that individually, each country

14:18.080 --> 14:21.320
 can answer its needs by building.

14:21.320 --> 14:24.560
 And up until now, we haven't had conflict,

14:24.560 --> 14:28.280
 except in this issue of Russia supplying Europe.

14:31.040 --> 14:34.880
 Obviously, the pipeline, Nord Stream 2 has been closed,

14:34.880 --> 14:38.840
 and Nord Stream 1 is also probably gonna be phased out.

14:38.840 --> 14:43.840
 And the concept of Russia supplying gas to Europe

14:44.360 --> 14:47.480
 is now up in the air, and who knows what's gonna happen.

14:47.480 --> 14:50.800
 I just don't see how Europe can get away

14:50.800 --> 14:53.880
 from using Russian gas.

14:53.880 --> 14:55.460
 But Russian gas is not the solution,

14:55.460 --> 14:57.440
 because it's methane, too, and it goes up

14:57.440 --> 14:58.780
 into the atmosphere.

14:58.780 --> 15:03.780
 Methane, in the short term, is worse than coal, worse.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.760
 There's all kinds of charts we show in the film.

15:06.760 --> 15:09.320
 We try not to be too overfactual,

15:09.320 --> 15:12.940
 but methane is not the answer.

15:12.940 --> 15:14.260
 It's a short term answer.

15:18.580 --> 15:22.040
 Will countries go to war over energy is a question

15:22.040 --> 15:24.840
 that I'm trying to think of all the wars that happened.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.160
 You could say Germany, of course, during World War II

15:28.160 --> 15:32.480
 needed oil very badly, and it dictated their strategy

15:32.480 --> 15:36.800
 with Romania, et cetera, and getting the oil fields open.

15:36.800 --> 15:40.720
 But I haven't thought that one through.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.240
 I'd have to make a documentary on it

15:42.240 --> 15:47.240
 to really understand how energy and war interface.

15:47.720 --> 15:49.180
 It's always part of the calculation,

15:49.180 --> 15:51.600
 but it's a question of how much.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.320
 Right, that's the question.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.000
 I just have to ask, because you mentioned

15:55.000 --> 15:57.480
 your mom was from France, you've traveled

15:57.480 --> 16:00.280
 for this documentary, and you traveled in general

16:00.280 --> 16:03.140
 throughout the world in Russia, Ukraine.

16:04.760 --> 16:07.820
 What are the defining characteristics of these cultures?

16:07.820 --> 16:09.480
 Let's go with Russia.

16:09.480 --> 16:14.480
 So as I told you, I'm half Ukrainian, half Russian.

16:14.520 --> 16:16.280
 I came from that part of the world.

16:16.280 --> 16:18.840
 What are some interesting, beautiful aspects

16:18.840 --> 16:21.600
 of the culture of Russia and Ukraine?

16:21.600 --> 16:23.760
 I can't really speak honestly of Ukraine.

16:23.760 --> 16:28.080
 I was there only in 1983 when I visited

16:28.080 --> 16:30.560
 the Soviet Union under the communism,

16:30.560 --> 16:34.080
 and Kiev was beautiful and was one of the nicer places

16:34.080 --> 16:38.020
 I went, but they were very much stultified

16:38.020 --> 16:41.260
 by the communist system, they all were.

16:41.260 --> 16:43.760
 The best places to visit in Russia were always in the South,

16:43.760 --> 16:48.760
 whether Georgia or the Muslim countries,

16:49.120 --> 16:52.520
 it was always a better culture in terms of comfort.

16:52.520 --> 16:55.120
 But communism was rough, and that was the end of it,

16:55.120 --> 16:58.720
 pretty much Brezhnev regime, and then Andropov.

16:58.720 --> 17:01.840
 Gorbachev was three years in the future when I was there.

17:01.840 --> 17:05.680
 So I can't talk about Ukraine, and they've not been friendly

17:05.680 --> 17:08.160
 to me since ISIS, of course, since I made

17:08.160 --> 17:11.640
 the Putin interviews, you know, Ukraine has banned me,

17:11.640 --> 17:14.320
 I believe, they've been very tough on people

17:14.320 --> 17:16.200
 who are critical.

17:16.200 --> 17:19.520
 I think the Russian people have been very special to me,

17:19.520 --> 17:22.460
 and perhaps because of my European upbringing,

17:22.460 --> 17:25.000
 but I enjoy talking to them, I find them very open,

17:25.000 --> 17:29.320
 very generous, and they appreciate support,

17:29.320 --> 17:31.640
 they appreciate people who say, you know,

17:31.640 --> 17:33.840
 I understand why your government is doing this

17:33.840 --> 17:36.720
 or this or this, I've tried to stay open minded

17:36.720 --> 17:39.140
 and listen to both sides.

17:39.140 --> 17:42.040
 The thing that I have seen as an American is, of course,

17:42.040 --> 17:46.520
 this American enmity towards Russia from the very beginning.

17:46.520 --> 17:50.640
 I grew up in 1940, 46, I was born in the 50s,

17:50.640 --> 17:54.720
 it was so anti Russian, they were everywhere,

17:54.720 --> 17:57.080
 they were in our schools, they were in our State Department,

17:57.080 --> 18:01.600
 they were spying on us, they were stealing the country

18:01.600 --> 18:05.640
 from us, that was the way the American right wing,

18:05.640 --> 18:08.280
 not even the right wing, I'd say the Republican party,

18:08.280 --> 18:11.800
 pictured the Russians, they were actively engaged

18:11.800 --> 18:15.720
 in infiltrating America and changing our thinking.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.840
 And television shows were based on this,

18:17.840 --> 18:21.080
 it was very much the J. Edgar Hoover mentality

18:21.080 --> 18:24.960
 that communism was even behind the student protests

18:24.960 --> 18:28.640
 of the 1960s, this was the direction in which the FBI

18:28.640 --> 18:30.720
 and the CIA were thinking.

18:30.720 --> 18:35.240
 So I grew up with a prejudice, and it took me many years,

18:35.240 --> 18:38.800
 my father was a Republican and he was a stockbroker

18:38.800 --> 18:41.400
 and he was a very intelligent man, but even he,

18:41.400 --> 18:45.440
 because he was a World War II soldier, he was a colonel,

18:45.440 --> 18:47.480
 had fallen under the influence.

18:47.480 --> 18:50.080
 In order to be successful in American business

18:50.080 --> 18:53.400
 in the 1950s, you had to have a very strong

18:53.400 --> 18:58.080
 anti Soviet line, very strong, you wouldn't get ahead.

18:58.080 --> 19:01.640
 If you expressed any kind of, let's end this Cold War,

19:01.640 --> 19:04.640
 any kind of activity of that nature, you'd be cast aside

19:04.640 --> 19:09.640
 as a pinko or somebody who was not completely

19:09.840 --> 19:12.360
 on the board with the American way of doing business,

19:12.360 --> 19:15.020
 which was capitalism works, communism doesn't.

19:16.280 --> 19:19.680
 And in particular, communism was embodied

19:19.680 --> 19:24.400
 by the Soviet Union as the enemy.

19:24.400 --> 19:29.400
 So hence the narrative behind the Cold War.

19:29.400 --> 19:33.560
 Behind the Cold War, that's correct, and it basically

19:33.560 --> 19:37.480
 lasted, I mean, you saw the ups and downs of it.

19:37.480 --> 19:40.000
 When Reagan came in, I was, well, first of all,

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
 we had the crisis of 1962 with the Cuban Missile Crisis,

19:44.000 --> 19:47.520
 and Kennedy proved himself to be a warrior for peace.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.360
 He resolved that with Khrushchev.

19:49.360 --> 19:52.240
 That was a big moment, huge moment, and people don't

19:52.240 --> 19:56.400
 give him credit enough for really saving us from a war

19:56.400 --> 19:59.480
 that could have affected all of mankind.

19:59.480 --> 20:02.800
 But it still didn't avert.

20:02.800 --> 20:05.760
 No, because the moment he was killed,

20:05.760 --> 20:08.440
 honestly, there was a lot of, we can talk about that,

20:08.440 --> 20:11.240
 and as you know, I've made a film, JFK Revisited

20:11.240 --> 20:14.520
 is a documentary we released this year

20:14.520 --> 20:18.600
 about the movie I made in 1991.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.680
 But the moment he was killed, I would argue

20:21.680 --> 20:24.200
 that Lyndon Johnson went back immediately

20:24.200 --> 20:26.760
 to the old way of thinking, the old way of doing business,

20:26.760 --> 20:30.360
 which was the Eisenhower, Truman way,

20:30.360 --> 20:33.280
 which we had adapted since World War II.

20:33.280 --> 20:34.800
 That was an interim.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.520
 You have to think about it from, Roosevelt dies in 45.

20:37.520 --> 20:42.080
 Roosevelt has an interim of 15 years where he,

20:44.520 --> 20:47.200
 he has more of a democratic regime, more liberal.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.600
 He establishes, he recognizes the Soviet Union

20:49.600 --> 20:52.000
 for the first time since the revolution,

20:52.000 --> 20:54.640
 and he actually has a relationship with them.

20:54.640 --> 20:56.920
 He sends ambassadors who are friendly,

20:56.920 --> 21:01.440
 and he has a relationship with Stalin, et cetera,

21:01.440 --> 21:05.880
 and at Yalta, or no, at Tehran, rather,

21:05.880 --> 21:08.000
 that's where he had the relationship.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.840
 Do you think if JFK lived, we would not have a Cold War?

21:10.840 --> 21:14.600
 No, absolutely not, and we go into great depth on that

21:14.600 --> 21:17.000
 in the film, and I'd urge you to see it,

21:17.000 --> 21:19.480
 because it goes into all the issues around the world.

21:19.480 --> 21:21.920
 Kennedy was being very much an anti imperialist.

21:21.920 --> 21:24.880
 It turns out, and many people just don't understand that,

21:24.880 --> 21:28.520
 but you have to look at all his policies in Middle East

21:28.520 --> 21:32.760
 with Nasser, he had a relationship with Sukarno in Indonesia,

21:33.840 --> 21:35.760
 with Latin America, he made a big effort

21:35.760 --> 21:37.640
 with the Alliance for Progress,

21:37.640 --> 21:40.800
 and when Africa, above all, with Lumumba,

21:40.800 --> 21:42.760
 he was very shocked at his death,

21:42.760 --> 21:47.760
 and tried to defend the right, the integrity

21:47.840 --> 21:51.360
 of the Belgian Congo with Dag Hammarskjold of the UN.

21:51.360 --> 21:52.840
 He made a big effort.

21:52.840 --> 21:55.240
 Unfortunately, it didn't work out,

21:55.240 --> 21:57.280
 because Dag Hammarskjold was killed,

21:57.280 --> 21:58.840
 and then Kennedy was killed,

21:58.840 --> 22:01.400
 and Congo descended into the chaos

22:01.400 --> 22:03.240
 of Joseph Mobutu's dictatorship.

22:04.560 --> 22:07.040
 But Kennedy was very active in terms of,

22:07.040 --> 22:10.720
 as an Irishman, not as an Englishman, he was an Irishman.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.880
 And I say that because, well, we'll come back to that,

22:12.880 --> 22:14.600
 because Mr. Joe Biden is an Irishman,

22:14.600 --> 22:16.040
 but it's a different kind of an Irishman.

22:16.040 --> 22:19.400
 They're both Catholic Irish, but Kennedy really made

22:19.400 --> 22:24.400
 an effort to change the imperialist mindset

22:25.320 --> 22:30.000
 that still was very strong in America and Europe.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.160
 Lyndon Johnson changed back to the old policy,

22:33.160 --> 22:36.360
 and we were never able to really keep

22:36.360 --> 22:37.800
 big talk going with the Russians.

22:37.800 --> 22:42.800
 Briefly had it with Carter, but then Brzezinski came in.

22:42.800 --> 22:45.480
 Brzezinski was his national security advisor.

22:45.480 --> 22:47.000
 He was put there by Rockefeller,

22:47.000 --> 22:50.760
 and Brzezinski was a Pole, he got revenge from Poland.

22:50.760 --> 22:53.080
 Poland has always been attacking Russia,

22:53.080 --> 22:55.760
 as far as I remember, back to another century.

22:55.760 --> 22:58.960
 I mean, the two world wars that occupied Russia,

22:58.960 --> 23:02.360
 so tragically, entry points were always

23:02.360 --> 23:03.760
 through Poland and Ukraine.

23:05.360 --> 23:07.720
 So Brzezinski got his revenge,

23:07.720 --> 23:11.600
 and Carter ended up being an enemy of the Soviet Union,

23:11.600 --> 23:15.240
 and creating, as Brzezinski took pride in it,

23:15.240 --> 23:16.880
 he created the atmosphere of the trap

23:16.880 --> 23:20.600
 for the Soviets to go into Afghanistan in 79.

23:20.600 --> 23:24.120
 That trap was set, he says, he said, in 1978.

23:26.240 --> 23:29.400
 So there was never, except for brief moments,

23:29.400 --> 23:33.240
 periods of detente with the Soviets,

23:33.240 --> 23:35.200
 and I grew up under that.

23:35.200 --> 23:37.800
 I didn't really know anything of this going on,

23:37.800 --> 23:40.600
 because I was learning, I was educating myself

23:40.600 --> 23:42.200
 as I was going, learning movies,

23:42.200 --> 23:45.040
 and trying to be a dramatist, and this and that,

23:45.040 --> 23:47.280
 so I wasn't thinking about this.

23:47.280 --> 23:50.440
 Then, when Reagan came in, I was worried again,

23:50.440 --> 23:52.520
 because it was the beat of the old beat,

23:52.520 --> 23:54.840
 which was there, the most evil empire.

23:54.840 --> 23:57.720
 I mean, it goes on in American history, it doesn't end.

23:57.720 --> 24:00.080
 Reagan got a lot of points for that,

24:00.080 --> 24:04.600
 and of course, when Gorbachev came in,

24:04.600 --> 24:07.360
 it was a beautiful moment for the world.

24:07.360 --> 24:09.000
 It was a great surprise.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.480
 It was probably the best years for America,

24:11.480 --> 24:13.040
 at least from my point of view,

24:13.040 --> 24:16.280
 in terms of this relaxation in the mood.

24:16.280 --> 24:21.280
 1986 to 1991 were great years

24:21.560 --> 24:24.400
 in terms of ability to believe, once again,

24:24.400 --> 24:27.040
 that there could be a peace dividend,

24:27.040 --> 24:30.080
 but the world changed again in 1991, 92.

24:30.080 --> 24:31.880
 There's an internal mechanism, who knows?

24:31.880 --> 24:35.000
 You could blame the United States,

24:35.000 --> 24:36.680
 you could blame Russia for...

24:39.040 --> 24:41.080
 Gorbachev was perhaps not the right man

24:41.080 --> 24:43.400
 to try to administer that country at that point.

24:43.400 --> 24:47.120
 He had great visions, he was a man of peace,

24:47.120 --> 24:48.880
 but it was very difficult to hold together

24:48.880 --> 24:50.080
 such a huge empire.

24:50.080 --> 24:53.520
 So vision is not enough to hold together the Soviet Union?

24:53.520 --> 24:56.360
 I think the details are interesting.

24:56.360 --> 24:58.000
 I followed up on that a little bit,

24:58.000 --> 25:01.520
 because I was recently in countries like Kazakhstan,

25:01.520 --> 25:05.360
 talked about the negotiations that were going on,

25:05.360 --> 25:08.360
 and the breakup of the Soviet Union.

25:08.360 --> 25:09.800
 It's a very interesting story,

25:09.800 --> 25:12.160
 because it involves everything, Ukraine, of course,

25:12.160 --> 25:14.080
 everything that's going on now.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.760
 Some, what is it, 30 million Russians

25:15.760 --> 25:19.320
 were left outside of the Soviet Union when it collapsed.

25:19.320 --> 25:21.840
 They had no home anymore, they were homes

25:21.840 --> 25:23.760
 in other countries, such as in Ukraine.

25:25.640 --> 25:29.240
 So it's an interesting story, and with repercussions today,

25:30.200 --> 25:34.520
 Kazakhstan is a good example of keeping a balance,

25:34.520 --> 25:36.160
 keeping it neutral.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.840
 He played both sides,

25:37.840 --> 25:41.520
 and because Yeltsin wanted him

25:41.520 --> 25:45.320
 to join the Russian Confederation

25:45.320 --> 25:48.640
 in a certain way where he'd be supporting,

25:48.640 --> 25:52.000
 against Gorbachev, there's a whole inward battle there.

25:53.400 --> 25:57.800
 I think the Ukraine came along with Yeltsin,

25:57.800 --> 26:02.280
 as well as, I'm sorry, I don't remember now,

26:02.280 --> 26:04.760
 but two other regions came with him,

26:04.760 --> 26:09.240
 and that was a block that broke up the Soviet Union.

26:09.240 --> 26:12.280
 It was Yeltsin's plan to,

26:12.280 --> 26:15.760
 and it wasn't make the Russian Federation, and they did.

26:15.760 --> 26:19.240
 I would love to return back to JFK eventually,

26:19.240 --> 26:20.640
 because he's such a fascinating figure

26:20.640 --> 26:23.600
 in the history of human civilization,

26:23.600 --> 26:26.200
 but let me ask you, fast forward.

26:26.200 --> 26:29.720
 In 2000, Yeltsin was no longer president,

26:29.720 --> 26:32.440
 and Vladimir Putin became president.

26:32.440 --> 26:36.600
 You did a series of interviews with Vladimir Putin,

26:36.600 --> 26:39.080
 as you mentioned, over a period of two years,

26:39.080 --> 26:41.500
 from 2015 to 2017.

26:43.080 --> 26:45.740
 Let me ask with a high level question.

26:45.740 --> 26:49.720
 What was your goal with that conversation?

26:49.720 --> 26:54.240
 Oh, came out in 2017, I guess I started them in 2014.

26:55.440 --> 26:58.560
 At that point, the Snowden affair had happened,

26:58.560 --> 27:00.760
 and I was working on a movie on Snowden.

27:00.760 --> 27:05.760
 That happened in 13, Ukraine happened in 14,

27:08.200 --> 27:10.880
 and one thing after another.

27:10.880 --> 27:14.640
 By 14, Putin was enemy number, again,

27:14.640 --> 27:17.200
 becoming a wanted man on the American list.

27:17.200 --> 27:20.580
 He was enemy, he was certainly in the top five.

27:22.480 --> 27:24.720
 But the animosity towards Putin

27:24.720 --> 27:27.840
 had been growing since 2007 at Munich.

27:27.840 --> 27:29.880
 I remember that speech when he made it.

27:29.880 --> 27:32.720
 It's in my documentary, that's a four hour documentary,

27:32.720 --> 27:34.000
 four different conversations.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.660
 I mean, we talked over two years, two and a half years,

27:37.660 --> 27:40.080
 but I remember that image of him at Munich

27:40.080 --> 27:44.980
 making a very important speech about world harmony,

27:44.980 --> 27:47.480
 about the balance necessary in the world,

27:47.480 --> 27:52.200
 and I remember the sneer, the sneer on John McCain's face.

27:52.200 --> 27:55.460
 He was in Munich, obviously eyeballing Putin

27:55.460 --> 27:57.760
 and hating him, and it was so evident

27:57.760 --> 28:01.160
 that McCain had no belief whatsoever that this,

28:01.160 --> 28:03.080
 he was almost treating him like these are the communists

28:03.080 --> 28:05.840
 are back, and we know that Putin was not a communist.

28:05.840 --> 28:07.840
 We know that Putin is very much a market man,

28:07.840 --> 28:12.840
 and he made it very clear and tried to keep an open climate,

28:13.340 --> 28:15.000
 a new relationship with Europe,

28:15.000 --> 28:17.160
 but the United States always, certain people

28:17.160 --> 28:18.800
 in the United States always saw that as a threat,

28:18.800 --> 28:21.580
 like Putin is trying to take Europe away from us

28:21.580 --> 28:24.800
 as if we own it, as if we have the right to own it.

28:24.800 --> 28:26.720
 But Putin was making the point, it's very important,

28:26.720 --> 28:31.600
 about sovereignty, and sovereignty for countries

28:31.600 --> 28:35.000
 is crucial for this new world to have balance.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.240
 That's sovereignty for China, sovereignty for Russia,

28:38.240 --> 28:41.920
 sovereignty for Iran, sovereignty for Venezuela,

28:41.920 --> 28:43.240
 sovereignty for Cuba.

28:43.240 --> 28:45.960
 This is an idea that's crucial to the new world,

28:45.960 --> 28:48.600
 and I think the United States has never accepted that.

28:49.760 --> 28:53.480
 Sovereignty is not an idea that they can allow.

28:53.480 --> 28:58.480
 You have to be obedient to the United States idea

28:58.960 --> 29:02.240
 of so called democracy and freedom,

29:02.240 --> 29:07.120
 but much more important is sovereignty for these countries,

29:07.120 --> 29:08.880
 and the United States has not obeyed that,

29:08.880 --> 29:13.600
 has not even acknowledged it, and it never comes up.

29:13.600 --> 29:15.600
 So from the perspective of the United States,

29:15.600 --> 29:18.440
 when power centers arise in the world,

29:18.440 --> 29:23.440
 you start to oppose those, not because of the ideas,

29:24.740 --> 29:28.460
 but merely because they have power.

29:28.460 --> 29:30.660
 Isn't that at the heart of the doctrine

29:30.660 --> 29:32.780
 of the neoconservatives,

29:32.780 --> 29:34.940
 and the pact for the new American century

29:34.940 --> 29:38.220
 they wrote down in 1996, seven,

29:38.220 --> 29:41.700
 they said there shall be no emergence of a rival power.

29:41.700 --> 29:43.980
 It was very clear it was about power,

29:43.980 --> 29:46.480
 and they've stuck to that doctrine,

29:46.480 --> 29:49.340
 which is if you start to get dangerous in any way

29:49.340 --> 29:51.620
 or have power, we're gonna knock you out.

29:52.680 --> 29:56.000
 Now that won't work, and I don't believe it can work,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.220
 and that is unfortunately a policy

29:58.220 --> 30:00.140
 the United States is following,

30:00.140 --> 30:04.180
 and the neoconservatives group, which is very small,

30:04.180 --> 30:05.660
 but it's very strong apparently,

30:05.660 --> 30:08.020
 and their idea has resonated.

30:08.020 --> 30:12.640
 It was behind the George Bush's invasion of Iraq.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.560
 It was part of not only Iraq,

30:14.560 --> 30:17.780
 but cleaning out the whole world, draining the swamp,

30:17.780 --> 30:19.220
 going to Afghanistan first,

30:19.220 --> 30:21.660
 and then although Iraq had nothing to do

30:21.660 --> 30:24.880
 with al Qaeda's attack, going after Iraq.

30:25.960 --> 30:28.100
 And of course 60 some other countries

30:28.100 --> 30:33.100
 that were terrorism had some signs of,

30:34.740 --> 30:38.260
 wherever America judged would be a dangerous country.

30:38.260 --> 30:41.300
 We had the right, you're either with us or against us.

30:41.300 --> 30:43.540
 Now that is a disastrous policy,

30:43.540 --> 30:45.160
 and led to one thing after another.

30:45.160 --> 30:47.160
 The Iraq war never learned a lesson.

30:48.060 --> 30:50.180
 The neoconservatives were never fired,

30:50.180 --> 30:51.540
 never thrown out of office.

30:51.540 --> 30:55.280
 The people who prosecuted that war are still around.

30:55.280 --> 30:57.340
 Many of them are still around,

30:57.340 --> 31:00.260
 and they're obviously guiding America now.

31:00.260 --> 31:03.540
 Let me return to this question of power.

31:03.540 --> 31:07.220
 Don't forget the sneer that I saw there.

31:07.220 --> 31:09.440
 That emblemized the United States reaction.

31:09.440 --> 31:12.580
 Also there were several other American representatives

31:12.580 --> 31:16.180
 who were laughing, kind of mocking Putin.

31:16.180 --> 31:17.280
 It was very serious.

31:17.280 --> 31:20.120
 I felt there was a divide there.

31:21.780 --> 31:25.100
 So since then, I mean in a certain sense,

31:25.100 --> 31:27.740
 the Europe reaction to Putin is crucial,

31:27.740 --> 31:31.060
 and they were more with him back then.

31:31.060 --> 31:34.460
 And a big thing for America was always to keep NATO,

31:34.460 --> 31:37.500
 to keep Europe in its pocket as a satellite.

31:37.500 --> 31:40.700
 And with this recent war, of course they've succeeded

31:40.700 --> 31:42.620
 in beyond their dreams.

31:42.620 --> 31:44.780
 The Russians have fulfilled the fantasy

31:44.780 --> 31:47.820
 of the United States, to finally be this aggressor

31:47.820 --> 31:50.180
 that they have pictured for years.

31:50.180 --> 31:51.640
 We can talk about that later.

31:51.640 --> 31:56.640
 But at that time, Europe had significant support for Putin,

31:58.180 --> 32:01.700
 and the United States was sneering at Putin.

32:01.700 --> 32:03.380
 That's correct, you can say that.

32:03.380 --> 32:05.300
 And then, so there was this,

32:05.300 --> 32:10.300
 there was uncertainty as to the direction,

32:12.220 --> 32:13.420
 as to the future of Russia.

32:13.420 --> 32:16.900
 And that's exactly when you interviewed Vladimir Putin.

32:16.900 --> 32:20.020
 I wanted to know what they thought,

32:20.020 --> 32:24.520
 because we couldn't get the information war

32:24.520 --> 32:26.340
 that the United States was fighting against Russia.

32:26.340 --> 32:28.020
 It was in evidence back then.

32:28.020 --> 32:29.380
 It was full out.

32:29.380 --> 32:33.500
 The condemnation of Russia on all fronts.

32:33.500 --> 32:36.820
 I never saw a positive article about Putin.

32:36.820 --> 32:38.420
 Although when I traveled in the world,

32:38.420 --> 32:40.700
 and I traveled a lot doing documentaries,

32:40.700 --> 32:44.180
 it was very clear in the Middle East, in Africa, in Asia,

32:44.180 --> 32:45.740
 there was respect for him.

32:45.740 --> 32:48.380
 That he was a man who was getting his job done

32:48.380 --> 32:50.100
 in the interest of Russia.

32:50.100 --> 32:53.580
 He was, as I said in the documentary, a son of Russia.

32:53.580 --> 32:58.020
 Very much so, in the positive sense, a son of Russia.

32:58.020 --> 33:02.100
 Not that he's out there trying to destroy

33:02.100 --> 33:05.340
 the interests of other countries, no.

33:05.340 --> 33:09.020
 That he was out there to promote the interests of Russia,

33:09.020 --> 33:11.060
 but at the same time, keep a balance.

33:11.060 --> 33:14.140
 Keep the world into a harmony.

33:14.140 --> 33:15.980
 This has always been his picture.

33:15.980 --> 33:17.880
 Peace was always his idea.

33:17.880 --> 33:19.780
 In other words, he always referred to the United States

33:19.780 --> 33:22.740
 in all these interviews as our partners.

33:22.740 --> 33:24.320
 And I said, will you stop using that word?

33:24.320 --> 33:25.160
 They're not.

33:26.580 --> 33:28.380
 And he was a little bit slow in waking up

33:28.380 --> 33:31.140
 to what the United States was doing.

33:31.140 --> 33:34.460
 Well, that said, he's one of the most powerful men

33:34.460 --> 33:35.940
 in the world.

33:35.940 --> 33:37.980
 He was at that time.

33:37.980 --> 33:40.840
 And let me ask you the human question.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.440
 As the old adage goes, power corrupts

33:44.440 --> 33:47.260
 and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

33:47.260 --> 33:52.260
 Did you see any corroding effects of power on the man?

33:52.920 --> 33:55.500
 Forget the political leader, on just the human being

33:55.500 --> 33:59.420
 that carries that power on his shoulders for so many years.

33:59.420 --> 34:03.660
 Keep in mind that he's been, unlike most modern leaders,

34:03.660 --> 34:06.220
 he's been in office off and on,

34:06.220 --> 34:08.860
 because Medvedev was president

34:08.860 --> 34:12.740
 and he was not literally in charge.

34:12.740 --> 34:17.060
 He took another appointment at that point,

34:17.060 --> 34:18.860
 but he was still very much involved.

34:18.860 --> 34:20.540
 But for 20 years, more or less,

34:20.540 --> 34:24.580
 he's been at the administrator of the state,

34:24.580 --> 34:26.580
 the protector of the state.

34:26.580 --> 34:29.780
 And he's apparently done a good enough job

34:29.780 --> 34:32.060
 that the Russian people have kept him there.

34:32.060 --> 34:34.020
 Because contrary to what many people think,

34:34.020 --> 34:37.460
 I really believe that if the Russian people didn't want him,

34:37.460 --> 34:39.180
 he would be out.

34:39.180 --> 34:40.260
 I firmly believe that.

34:40.260 --> 34:42.700
 I don't think you can go against the will of the people.

34:42.700 --> 34:44.900
 Now, it expresses itself in many ways,

34:44.900 --> 34:46.520
 at the ballot box and so forth,

34:46.520 --> 34:47.980
 but also in other ways in Russia.

34:47.980 --> 34:51.420
 There's a strong currents of opinion.

34:51.420 --> 34:55.580
 So contrary to what the position of him as a dictator,

34:55.580 --> 34:58.300
 he wouldn't last if he was unpopular, number one.

34:58.300 --> 35:01.860
 Number two, Russia is much more divided than people know.

35:01.860 --> 35:03.500
 There's other factors in Russia.

35:04.580 --> 35:07.820
 There are always tensions around the Kremlin,

35:07.820 --> 35:09.940
 who has power, who doesn't have power.

35:09.940 --> 35:12.680
 That's been going on for 100 years.

35:12.680 --> 35:17.420
 But the factions in Russia are very much there.

35:17.420 --> 35:22.140
 So when people refer to Russia as Putin, they're mistaken.

35:22.140 --> 35:25.040
 And they do this regularly in the New York papers

35:25.040 --> 35:25.880
 and all this.

35:25.880 --> 35:28.020
 They say, Putin did this, Putin did that,

35:28.020 --> 35:31.100
 Putin's doing that, but it's Russia that's doing it.

35:31.100 --> 35:34.220
 And that's what, there's a distinction there that I,

35:34.220 --> 35:35.060
 it's changed.

35:35.060 --> 35:37.780
 In the old days, I would read about Khrushchev,

35:37.780 --> 35:40.040
 but it was never Khrushchev personally.

35:40.040 --> 35:41.840
 It was about the Soviet Union.

35:43.100 --> 35:45.020
 There was respect for a country.

35:45.020 --> 35:48.040
 And now when it started to get personal with Putin,

35:48.860 --> 35:53.360
 it changed and our thinking changed in a negative way.

35:53.360 --> 35:56.180
 We no longer respected it as a country,

35:56.180 --> 35:57.380
 we were seeing it as a man.

35:57.380 --> 36:00.100
 And the man we had trashed repeatedly,

36:00.100 --> 36:02.780
 repeatedly as a poisoner, as a murderer,

36:02.780 --> 36:04.900
 and none of which has ever been proven,

36:04.900 --> 36:07.100
 but which has always been repeated and repeated

36:07.100 --> 36:10.900
 to the point at which it becomes like an Orwell mantra.

36:10.900 --> 36:13.740
 It becomes like, he is of course a bad guy.

36:13.740 --> 36:17.280
 Can I just ask you, as a great filmmaker,

36:17.280 --> 36:20.340
 as a human being, what was it like talking

36:20.340 --> 36:23.060
 to one of the most powerful men in the world?

36:23.060 --> 36:25.260
 For honestly, and I'm not naive,

36:25.260 --> 36:27.660
 I've talked to a lot of powerful people.

36:28.980 --> 36:30.900
 In the movie business, there are powerful people

36:30.900 --> 36:32.580
 and many of them are corrupted.

36:32.580 --> 36:34.100
 I've talked to many people in my life.

36:34.100 --> 36:38.060
 I've been in the military, I've seen, I've had other jobs.

36:38.060 --> 36:40.420
 I have to say, I found him to be a human being.

36:40.420 --> 36:43.620
 I just found him to be reasonable, calm.

36:44.500 --> 36:45.980
 I never saw him lose his temper.

36:45.980 --> 36:48.980
 And I mean, you have to understand that most people,

36:48.980 --> 36:51.820
 most people in the Western way of doing business

36:51.820 --> 36:53.100
 get emotional.

36:53.100 --> 36:54.220
 I don't see that.

36:54.220 --> 36:56.700
 I saw him as a balanced man,

36:56.700 --> 36:59.020
 as a man who had studied this like you have.

36:59.020 --> 37:00.860
 There's a calmness to you.

37:00.860 --> 37:02.420
 It comes from studying the world

37:02.420 --> 37:05.360
 and having a rational response to it.

37:06.420 --> 37:07.980
 It's interesting, his two daughters,

37:07.980 --> 37:09.580
 one of them is very scientific

37:09.580 --> 37:12.500
 and the other one's doing very well in another profession,

37:12.500 --> 37:15.360
 but they're a thinking family.

37:15.360 --> 37:17.000
 His wife too was.

37:18.180 --> 37:19.340
 I can't talk for the new wife

37:19.340 --> 37:20.380
 because I don't know about it,

37:20.380 --> 37:23.660
 but he kept his family with great respect.

37:23.660 --> 37:26.180
 He's raised his daughter's right.

37:26.180 --> 37:28.220
 He served Yeltsin the way he looked at it.

37:28.220 --> 37:32.780
 He served Yeltsin well, and he never trashed Yeltsin.

37:32.780 --> 37:34.100
 Certainly a lot of people did,

37:34.100 --> 37:38.020
 but I asked him repeatedly was he an alcoholic,

37:38.020 --> 37:40.220
 this or that, but he wouldn't even go that far.

37:40.220 --> 37:41.900
 Just respect.

37:41.900 --> 37:46.900
 And this man, Yeltsin, was in many ways ridiculed

37:46.900 --> 37:51.900
 by the Russians, and he turned over the power

37:52.020 --> 37:53.780
 because he felt like he was overwhelmed.

37:53.780 --> 37:56.160
 He turned over the power to this man because why?

37:56.160 --> 37:57.860
 How many people had he fired before him?

37:57.860 --> 38:00.460
 Several, several prime ministers, this, that.

38:00.460 --> 38:03.260
 Why did he turn power over to Mr. Putin?

38:03.260 --> 38:07.700
 Because he respected him for his work ethic

38:07.700 --> 38:10.860
 and his balance, his maturity.

38:10.860 --> 38:12.860
 And that's what I can say is I saw in him.

38:12.860 --> 38:17.860
 A poor person from a poor family who worked his way up

38:18.740 --> 38:21.780
 through the KGB, Americans keep saying he's a KGB agent,

38:21.780 --> 38:25.980
 but it's like saying George Bush was a CIA agent,

38:25.980 --> 38:28.860
 but he became, you grow, you grow in your life.

38:28.860 --> 38:33.060
 And he went from the KGB to this technocratic position.

38:33.060 --> 38:38.060
 He dealt with many problems, including the Chechnyan War,

38:38.100 --> 38:40.500
 which is a very difficult situation,

38:40.500 --> 38:43.100
 as well as the Russian submarine problem.

38:43.100 --> 38:44.940
 Several things happened early in his,

38:44.940 --> 38:47.900
 that gave him a lot of experience,

38:47.900 --> 38:49.960
 and he handled them all pretty well.

38:49.960 --> 38:52.100
 Do you think he was an honest man?

38:52.100 --> 38:52.920
 I do.

38:52.920 --> 38:54.900
 Now, of course, the question of money,

38:54.900 --> 38:57.300
 the charge is that he's the richest man in the world,

38:57.300 --> 39:00.420
 or ludicrous, certainly doesn't live like it

39:00.420 --> 39:01.340
 or act like it.

39:01.340 --> 39:03.540
 If you're rich, I've been around

39:03.540 --> 39:05.140
 a lot of rich people in my life.

39:05.140 --> 39:06.020
 You'd probably have, too.

39:06.020 --> 39:07.500
 In America, you run into them.

39:07.500 --> 39:08.740
 So many of them are arrogant.

39:08.740 --> 39:11.380
 I'm actually good friends now

39:11.380 --> 39:13.140
 with the richest man in the world.

39:13.140 --> 39:16.820
 Of course, I saw your interview with Mr. Musk,

39:16.820 --> 39:18.180
 who I appreciate.

39:18.180 --> 39:19.680
 At least he speaks freely.

39:21.480 --> 39:23.780
 I'm positive about him owning Twitter,

39:23.780 --> 39:27.100
 because Twitter has become censorship city,

39:27.100 --> 39:29.100
 as has all the major tech.

39:29.100 --> 39:30.860
 I mean, the censorship that we are now seeing

39:30.860 --> 39:34.620
 in the United States is so unAmerican and shocking to me.

39:34.620 --> 39:36.940
 And he is a resistance to that, that is true.

39:36.940 --> 39:38.440
 Yeah, I like Musk for that.

39:38.440 --> 39:39.340
 Just for that only.

39:39.340 --> 39:43.380
 But I also appreciate him, his adventuresome,

39:43.380 --> 39:47.680
 his nature and his desire to explore the world

39:47.680 --> 39:49.020
 and to ask questions.

39:49.020 --> 39:54.020
 Yeah, there's certain ways you sound when you speak freely.

39:54.060 --> 39:56.260
 There's certain ways you sound,

39:56.260 --> 39:58.540
 a man sounds when he speaks freely,

39:58.540 --> 40:00.420
 and he speaks freely.

40:00.420 --> 40:02.500
 And it's refreshing.

40:02.500 --> 40:05.140
 No matter whether you're rich or not, it doesn't matter.

40:05.140 --> 40:06.940
 When you speak freely, it's a beautiful thing.

40:06.940 --> 40:10.180
 Actually, Musk, in a major point

40:10.180 --> 40:12.020
 on going back to nuclear energy,

40:12.020 --> 40:15.580
 he never believed in it at first, apparently.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.180
 He was going for batteries, right?

40:17.180 --> 40:19.280
 And he put a lot of money into batteries.

40:19.280 --> 40:20.700
 He made them bigger and bigger batteries.

40:20.700 --> 40:23.300
 But it just, as Bill Gates has said,

40:23.300 --> 40:25.960
 it's just, it's not gonna get us there.

40:25.960 --> 40:28.220
 And now I think Musk is on another path.

40:28.220 --> 40:29.900
 He understands the need for nuclear.

40:29.900 --> 40:31.620
 Yeah, he's a supporter of nuclear.

40:33.620 --> 40:35.060
 We're jumping around.

40:35.060 --> 40:37.900
 Putin never asked for one thing, never.

40:37.900 --> 40:39.940
 It was an interview, it was free form.

40:39.940 --> 40:41.580
 Ask anything you want.

40:41.580 --> 40:43.480
 No restrictions, no rules.

40:44.780 --> 40:46.140
 As with Castro, frankly,

40:46.140 --> 40:47.820
 Castro did the same thing as did Chavez.

40:47.820 --> 40:50.660
 So I've had good luck in interviewing free ranging subjects,

40:50.660 --> 40:52.380
 people willing to express themselves.

40:52.380 --> 40:57.300
 He's much more guarded than Castro or Chavez,

40:57.300 --> 41:00.200
 because as you know, he's setting government policy

41:00.200 --> 41:01.040
 when he speaks.

41:01.040 --> 41:03.940
 Anything he says is gonna be taken out of context.

41:03.940 --> 41:06.920
 But there was no restrictions on what to talk about,

41:06.920 --> 41:07.760
 none of that.

41:07.760 --> 41:10.920
 Nor any desire to see anything before we published it.

41:10.920 --> 41:13.620
 No need to check it with him.

41:14.460 --> 41:17.780
 It was a completely.

41:17.780 --> 41:19.980
 Do you think he watched the final product?

41:19.980 --> 41:23.220
 Yes, I do, but I don't think he made judgments on it.

41:23.220 --> 41:25.280
 I think he was pleased.

41:25.280 --> 41:26.300
 He doesn't go either way.

41:26.300 --> 41:28.460
 You see, he's pleased.

41:28.460 --> 41:30.940
 I mean, it went well and he's happy for us.

41:30.940 --> 41:33.340
 But I don't think he had great enthusiasm

41:33.340 --> 41:34.820
 expressed it to me.

41:34.820 --> 41:35.740
 He trusted me.

41:35.740 --> 41:38.100
 And you can see the way he dealt with me each time.

41:38.100 --> 41:41.140
 He warmed up to me four times.

41:41.140 --> 41:44.300
 The first time I might've been a little stiff.

41:44.300 --> 41:47.180
 You're asking, you don't know who you're dealing with

41:47.180 --> 41:48.020
 and so forth.

41:48.020 --> 41:49.540
 I understand that.

41:49.540 --> 41:51.020
 But he's used to it now.

41:51.020 --> 41:53.380
 He's done a lot of press.

41:53.380 --> 41:55.500
 The worst press he's done, frankly,

41:55.500 --> 41:57.340
 has been the American press.

41:57.340 --> 41:59.220
 And not because of his fault,

41:59.220 --> 42:01.420
 but because of the way they have treated him.

42:01.420 --> 42:04.300
 If you look at the interviews, they're awful.

42:04.300 --> 42:06.820
 First of all, I noticed one thing as a filmmaker,

42:06.820 --> 42:09.020
 right away, they use an overdub.

42:09.020 --> 42:11.540
 They put a Russian speaker for everything he says,

42:11.540 --> 42:12.900
 who's much harsher.

42:12.900 --> 42:15.140
 He speaks Russian in a much harsher manner

42:15.140 --> 42:16.500
 than actually Putin does.

42:17.420 --> 42:20.340
 On my interview, I left him in his original language

42:20.340 --> 42:22.500
 with translator, and I think that's important

42:22.500 --> 42:26.400
 because he expresses himself very clearly and calmly.

42:27.620 --> 42:29.340
 When you listen to the American broadcast,

42:29.340 --> 42:30.940
 it's a belligerent person who looks like

42:30.940 --> 42:32.980
 he's about to bang his shoe on the table.

42:33.940 --> 42:37.280
 And secondly, the questions are highly aggressive

42:37.280 --> 42:38.120
 from the beginning.

42:38.120 --> 42:41.900
 There's no sense of rapport, there's no sense of,

42:41.900 --> 42:44.640
 well, it's why, Mr. Putin, did you poison this person?

42:44.640 --> 42:46.860
 Why, Mr. Putin, did you kill this person?

42:46.860 --> 42:47.860
 Why are you a murderer?

42:47.860 --> 42:52.240
 I mean, it's blunt, blunt negative television.

42:52.240 --> 42:53.960
 Yeah, it's not just aggressive.

42:53.960 --> 42:56.940
 So I obviously speak Russian,

42:56.940 --> 43:00.640
 so I get to appreciate both the original and the translation.

43:00.640 --> 43:04.880
 And it's not just aggressive, it's very shallow.

43:04.880 --> 43:06.860
 They're not looking to understand.

43:06.860 --> 43:09.460
 To me, aggression is okay if that's the way

43:09.460 --> 43:12.220
 you wanna approach it, but it should be,

43:12.220 --> 43:15.580
 there should be underlying kind of empathy

43:15.580 --> 43:19.140
 for another human being in order to be able to understand.

43:19.140 --> 43:23.460
 And so some of the worst interviews I've ever listened to

43:23.460 --> 43:25.700
 is by American press of Vladimir Putin.

43:25.700 --> 43:29.580
 So NBC and all those kinds of organizations,

43:29.580 --> 43:30.980
 it's very painful to watch.

43:32.100 --> 43:34.060
 And you saw the reception to the Putin interviews

43:34.060 --> 43:37.380
 in America was hostile without seeing it.

43:37.380 --> 43:41.460
 So many people criticized my series

43:41.460 --> 43:43.080
 without having seen it.

43:43.080 --> 43:45.540
 Even, I went on a show, a television show

43:45.540 --> 43:47.660
 with this famous coal bearer.

43:47.660 --> 43:49.700
 You know, he's very famous in America.

43:49.700 --> 43:51.720
 And I was shocked on the show to find out

43:51.720 --> 43:53.860
 that he hadn't seen anything of the four hours.

43:53.860 --> 43:56.140
 He was just attacking Putin.

43:56.140 --> 43:58.660
 And he threw me, I was complicit,

43:58.660 --> 44:01.500
 therefore I was a Putin supporter.

44:01.500 --> 44:03.940
 And the show was a disaster.

44:03.940 --> 44:05.980
 It's one of my worst television shows.

44:05.980 --> 44:10.660
 I actually, I had to just shut up and get off the air.

44:10.660 --> 44:13.780
 I mean, at some point, it was embarrassing.

44:13.780 --> 44:16.180
 Because the audience, too, was clapping for Kobe

44:16.180 --> 44:17.340
 on anything he said.

44:17.340 --> 44:20.100
 Well, as an interviewer in that situation,

44:20.100 --> 44:23.300
 because between you and Vladimir Putin,

44:23.300 --> 44:28.300
 there was camaraderie, there was joking, there was...

44:28.660 --> 44:33.660
 Are you worried, do you put that into the calculation

44:34.020 --> 44:37.660
 when you're making a film with somebody

44:37.660 --> 44:41.780
 that could be lying to you, that could be evil?

44:41.780 --> 44:43.980
 When you talk about Castro, you talk about,

44:43.980 --> 44:48.780
 so are you worried about how charisma of a man

44:48.780 --> 44:51.860
 across the table from you can...

44:51.860 --> 44:53.580
 Do I take that into account?

44:53.580 --> 44:55.300
 I absolutely take that into account.

44:55.300 --> 44:58.820
 I mean, doing Castro, he's a wonderful speaker,

44:58.820 --> 45:01.340
 he's charismatic, so is Chavez.

45:01.340 --> 45:03.040
 Look at those interviews.

45:03.040 --> 45:04.560
 I took it into account.

45:04.560 --> 45:06.360
 But Putin doesn't play that game.

45:06.360 --> 45:09.540
 He doesn't charm you, he doesn't try to overwhelm you

45:09.540 --> 45:13.780
 with his bon ami at all.

45:13.780 --> 45:15.620
 He just says, okay, ask your question,

45:15.620 --> 45:17.180
 I'll give you my answer straight.

45:17.180 --> 45:19.340
 Here it is, and he analyzes it.

45:19.340 --> 45:20.580
 This is the history of NATO,

45:20.580 --> 45:22.180
 this is the history of our relationship

45:22.180 --> 45:23.460
 with the United States.

45:23.460 --> 45:26.000
 How many times have we tried to talk to them

45:26.000 --> 45:27.740
 about such and such and such and such,

45:27.740 --> 45:29.980
 and each time, we get nowhere.

45:29.980 --> 45:31.540
 In fact, it's a very...

45:32.860 --> 45:35.460
 I would like to get along with the United States so much,

45:35.460 --> 45:38.820
 he's saying it so clearly in all his words.

45:38.820 --> 45:40.780
 So to play devil's advocate.

45:40.780 --> 45:42.580
 But he's not making a big deal about it.

45:42.580 --> 45:44.820
 But there is a charisma in the calmness.

45:44.820 --> 45:45.780
 Yes, there is.

45:45.780 --> 45:50.000
 So let's just calm everything down, it's simple facts.

45:50.000 --> 45:55.000
 That you can call, so there's like the Hitler thing,

45:56.340 --> 46:00.260
 which is screaming, being very loud, charismatic,

46:00.260 --> 46:02.100
 strong message and so on.

46:02.100 --> 46:03.500
 And then there's a Putin style,

46:03.500 --> 46:04.620
 I'm not comparing those two,

46:04.620 --> 46:07.860
 there's the Putin style communication of calmness.

46:07.860 --> 46:10.500
 And that, at least to me, my personality,

46:10.500 --> 46:12.220
 that can be very captivating,

46:12.220 --> 46:15.220
 is bringing everything down, the facts are simple.

46:15.220 --> 46:16.860
 But then when you say the facts are simple,

46:16.860 --> 46:18.420
 you can now start lying.

46:18.420 --> 46:21.220
 And you don't know what's true and what's lies.

46:21.220 --> 46:23.180
 It behooves you to do some research.

46:23.180 --> 46:24.020
 Yes.

46:24.020 --> 46:26.260
 And frankly, when it comes to research,

46:26.260 --> 46:27.100
 you're gonna have a problem.

46:27.100 --> 46:30.060
 Because if you go to the Americanized versions

46:30.060 --> 46:33.540
 of Russian history, you're gonna run into a problem.

46:33.540 --> 46:35.680
 And that includes even Wikipedia.

46:35.680 --> 46:37.140
 They will tell you things

46:37.140 --> 46:39.580
 that are just not factually supported.

46:39.580 --> 46:42.540
 So it was a problem in terms of,

46:42.540 --> 46:45.060
 if you read all the books in the American library

46:45.060 --> 46:48.340
 about Putin, there's nothing positive about it.

46:48.340 --> 46:49.840
 They're awful, they're awful.

46:49.840 --> 46:52.680
 And a lot of them, I had a good relationship

46:52.680 --> 46:54.140
 with Professor Stephen Cohen,

46:54.140 --> 46:56.820
 who's the most, I think, one of the most informed men

46:56.820 --> 46:59.940
 on Russia, he'd done a lot of research all his life.

46:59.940 --> 47:02.700
 And knew Gorbachev very well.

47:02.700 --> 47:07.180
 And was very analytical about all these situations

47:07.180 --> 47:11.940
 that happened before his death in 2019.

47:11.940 --> 47:13.560
 I'm not quite sure when Stephen died,

47:13.560 --> 47:15.060
 but I knew him well.

47:15.060 --> 47:20.060
 And he gave me the best information I could get.

47:20.140 --> 47:22.360
 I would go to Stephen and I'd say,

47:22.360 --> 47:24.220
 I'm confused here, tell me the history

47:24.220 --> 47:27.100
 of this accusation of poisoning against this person

47:27.100 --> 47:27.940
 and so forth.

47:27.940 --> 47:30.620
 And he'd explain it to me in, I think,

47:30.620 --> 47:32.820
 the clearest ways that I understood.

47:32.820 --> 47:34.180
 And he said to me once, he said,

47:34.180 --> 47:35.780
 most of these people who go to Russia

47:35.780 --> 47:38.580
 and write this stuff about Putin are going off internet.

47:38.580 --> 47:40.660
 The internet has really been a source

47:40.660 --> 47:42.440
 of a lot of fractured facts here.

47:42.440 --> 47:44.760
 He said, pure analysis.

47:44.760 --> 47:46.880
 You have to go back to the texts,

47:46.880 --> 47:50.440
 all the documents, and to really fully understand.

47:50.440 --> 47:52.760
 But he spoke Russian.

47:54.040 --> 47:59.040
 And his wife and him, Katerina Vanhoovle,

47:59.080 --> 48:03.440
 who's an editor, publisher of The Nation magazine,

48:03.440 --> 48:06.280
 would go to Russia several times a year

48:06.280 --> 48:08.400
 and talk to their friend Gorbachev.

48:08.400 --> 48:10.440
 And Gorbachev's an interesting character.

48:10.440 --> 48:12.440
 I talked to him, interviewed him,

48:12.440 --> 48:14.400
 not interviewed him, but talked to him at length,

48:14.400 --> 48:16.360
 and I like him very much.

48:16.360 --> 48:19.160
 And I saw the divide, as you saw in the Putin interviews,

48:19.160 --> 48:20.840
 between Gorbachev and Putin.

48:20.840 --> 48:23.480
 Early on in the interviews, you sense Putin

48:23.480 --> 48:25.440
 doesn't particularly care for Gorbachev

48:25.440 --> 48:26.980
 because in his point of view,

48:26.980 --> 48:29.400
 he screwed up the administration of Russia

48:29.400 --> 48:32.400
 and is responsible for so much of the disaster

48:32.400 --> 48:35.000
 of leaving all those people outside the Soviet Union.

48:36.200 --> 48:39.400
 So these are problems that continue into the future.

48:39.400 --> 48:44.300
 But they see each other at the,

48:44.300 --> 48:48.500
 or he knows he's there at the May Day Parade, we filmed,

48:48.500 --> 48:52.800
 and his attitude is funny, it's very human.

48:53.880 --> 48:57.040
 He says, you know, he's welcome, he's got his pension,

48:57.040 --> 48:59.760
 he's a pensioneer, he's done his duty.

48:59.760 --> 49:04.720
 There's no animus towards him.

49:04.720 --> 49:07.000
 Even when Gorbachev, in the early days,

49:07.000 --> 49:09.680
 as you remember, criticized for his manners in terms

49:09.680 --> 49:14.680
 of democracy, but I don't know that that becomes a quarrel.

49:14.800 --> 49:18.840
 But frankly, by the end of the situation,

49:18.840 --> 49:21.840
 it's very clear that Gorbachev has now moved closer

49:21.840 --> 49:23.860
 and closer to the, says that Russia is now

49:23.860 --> 49:24.920
 really under attack.

49:24.920 --> 49:28.280
 This is, he sees where the United States

49:28.280 --> 49:31.840
 has made a concerted effort to undermine Putin.

49:31.840 --> 49:35.400
 And he's repeated this several times about Ukraine.

49:35.400 --> 49:37.280
 I think you've seen what he said.

49:37.280 --> 49:39.000
 You can quote it.

49:39.000 --> 49:42.040
 And Gorbachev is, we have no respect for Gorbachev even,

49:42.040 --> 49:43.520
 even at this juncture.

49:43.520 --> 49:46.480
 When can you see Gorbachev's ideas printed

49:46.480 --> 49:48.160
 in most American newspapers?

49:48.160 --> 49:52.120
 Very rarely, very rarely, and recently not at all.

49:52.120 --> 49:54.600
 So Gorbachev, who was our hero back in,

49:54.600 --> 49:58.120
 an American hero back in the 1980s,

49:58.120 --> 50:00.580
 has now been condemned to the garbage can,

50:00.580 --> 50:01.780
 so to speak, of history.

50:01.780 --> 50:05.380
 Well, in this complicated geopolitical picture

50:05.380 --> 50:08.440
 you just outlined, can we talk about

50:08.440 --> 50:12.180
 the recent invasion of Ukraine?

50:12.180 --> 50:17.180
 So you wrote on Facebook a pretty eloquent analysis,

50:17.500 --> 50:21.620
 I think on March 3rd.

50:22.900 --> 50:26.100
 Let me just read a small section of that,

50:26.100 --> 50:28.780
 just to give context, and maybe we can talk

50:28.780 --> 50:31.880
 a little bit more about both Russia and the man Putin.

50:33.140 --> 50:35.340
 You wrote, although the United States

50:35.340 --> 50:38.020
 has many wars of aggression on its conscience,

50:38.020 --> 50:41.780
 it doesn't justify Mr. Putin's aggression in Ukraine.

50:41.780 --> 50:44.500
 A dozen wrongs don't make a right.

50:44.500 --> 50:46.460
 Russia was wrong to invade.

50:46.460 --> 50:48.580
 It has made too many mistakes.

50:48.580 --> 50:51.440
 One, underestimating Ukraine resistance.

50:51.440 --> 50:54.100
 Two, overestimating the military ability

50:54.100 --> 50:55.940
 to achieve its objective.

50:55.940 --> 50:58.480
 Three, underestimating Europe's reaction,

50:58.480 --> 51:01.760
 especially Germany, upping its military contribution

51:01.760 --> 51:04.980
 to NATO, which they've resisted for some 20 years.

51:04.980 --> 51:07.580
 Even Switzerland has joined the cause.

51:07.580 --> 51:11.540
 Russia will be more isolated than ever from the West.

51:11.540 --> 51:15.100
 Four, underestimating the enhanced power of NATO,

51:15.100 --> 51:18.020
 which will now put more pressure on Russia's borders.

51:18.020 --> 51:22.000
 Five, probably putting Ukraine into NATO.

51:22.000 --> 51:25.820
 Six, underestimating the damage to its own economy,

51:25.820 --> 51:28.220
 and certainly creating more internal resistance

51:28.220 --> 51:29.360
 in Russia.

51:29.360 --> 51:32.520
 Seven, creating a major readjustment of power

51:32.520 --> 51:34.800
 in its oligarch class.

51:34.800 --> 51:39.800
 Eight, putting cluster and vacuum bombs into play.

51:39.800 --> 51:43.300
 Nine, and underestimating the power

51:43.300 --> 51:45.340
 of social media worldwide.

51:45.340 --> 51:49.700
 And you go on for a while giving a much broader picture

51:51.020 --> 51:53.820
 of the history and the geopolitics of all of this.

51:53.820 --> 51:58.820
 So now, a little bit later, two months later,

52:01.020 --> 52:05.140
 what are your thoughts about the invasion of Ukraine?

52:05.140 --> 52:08.660
 Well, it's very hard to be honest in this regard

52:08.660 --> 52:13.660
 because the West has brought down a curtain here

52:13.900 --> 52:18.380
 and anyone who questions the invasion of Ukraine

52:18.380 --> 52:23.380
 and its consequences is an enemy of the people.

52:24.340 --> 52:26.780
 It's become so difficult.

52:26.780 --> 52:31.780
 I've never seen in my lifetime ever such a wall

52:33.140 --> 52:38.140
 of propaganda as I've seen in the West.

52:38.580 --> 52:39.860
 And that includes France too

52:39.860 --> 52:42.020
 because I was there recently and England.

52:42.020 --> 52:46.420
 England is of course really vociferous.

52:46.420 --> 52:50.220
 It's shocking to me how quickly Europe moved

52:50.220 --> 52:52.460
 in this direction and that includes Germany.

52:52.460 --> 52:55.020
 I have German friends who express to me their shock

52:55.020 --> 52:56.280
 over Ukraine.

52:56.280 --> 52:58.100
 I have Italian friends, same thing.

52:58.100 --> 53:01.740
 And Italy of course has been perhaps the most understanding

53:01.740 --> 53:03.980
 and compassionate of countries.

53:03.980 --> 53:08.020
 So it's quite evident that there's a united,

53:09.060 --> 53:11.820
 and this attests to the power of the United States.

53:11.820 --> 53:14.900
 And of course you have Finland and Svinland

53:14.900 --> 53:17.660
 which has generally been reasonable jumping in,

53:17.660 --> 53:20.640
 talking about joining NATO and Sweden too.

53:21.860 --> 53:26.260
 Generally there's been some more restraint in Europe.

53:26.260 --> 53:29.100
 That's what surprised me the most, Europe.

53:29.100 --> 53:32.500
 How quickly they fell into this NATO basket

53:33.420 --> 53:36.300
 which is very dangerous for Europe, very dangerous.

53:36.300 --> 53:38.960
 This goes back to my idea what I was saying earlier

53:38.960 --> 53:40.440
 about sovereignty.

53:41.460 --> 53:44.400
 These countries don't really give me a sense

53:44.400 --> 53:47.420
 that they have sovereignty over their own countries.

53:47.420 --> 53:52.420
 They don't feel, to me I'm obviously intuition here

53:52.420 --> 53:56.300
 is working, I just don't feel that they have freedom

53:56.300 --> 53:59.620
 to say what they really think and they're scared to say it.

53:59.620 --> 54:03.460
 When the United States invaded Iraq in 2003,

54:05.040 --> 54:07.900
 I remember with great in a sense satisfaction

54:07.900 --> 54:12.420
 that at least France, Chirac who I had not really

54:12.420 --> 54:15.120
 known much about, stood up and said the United States

54:15.120 --> 54:17.200
 we're not gonna join you in this expedition,

54:17.200 --> 54:18.940
 basically into madness.

54:18.940 --> 54:20.840
 Schroeder in Germany, same thing.

54:21.760 --> 54:24.340
 Of course Putin condemned the invasion

54:24.340 --> 54:27.260
 and Putin had been an ally of the United States

54:27.260 --> 54:29.620
 since 9 11 if you remember correctly.

54:29.620 --> 54:32.320
 And had called Bush and they were getting along.

54:32.320 --> 54:36.060
 So even Putin said I won't go, don't go into Iraq.

54:36.060 --> 54:38.940
 This is not the solution.

54:38.940 --> 54:41.900
 He didn't oppose Afghanistan but he opposed Iraq.

54:41.900 --> 54:46.720
 So Chirac and Schroeder stood for the old Europe.

54:46.720 --> 54:49.920
 I remember de Gaulle, Charles de Gaulle,

54:49.920 --> 54:52.420
 he was independent of the United States.

54:52.420 --> 54:54.620
 Charles de Gaulle pulled France out of NATO

54:54.620 --> 54:56.680
 because he saw the dangers of NATO,

54:56.680 --> 54:59.940
 which is to say you have to fight an American war.

54:59.940 --> 55:02.540
 When they say and they put nuclear weapons

55:02.540 --> 55:05.020
 on your territory in England and France

55:05.020 --> 55:09.020
 and Italy and Germany, when they do that,

55:09.020 --> 55:12.060
 you're hitched to this superpower

55:12.060 --> 55:14.980
 and you have no say in what they're gonna do.

55:14.980 --> 55:18.140
 If they declare war and they use your territory,

55:18.140 --> 55:20.820
 you're gonna be involved in a major conflict.

55:20.820 --> 55:22.060
 I'm talking about sovereignty.

55:22.060 --> 55:23.620
 Where is that sovereignty?

55:23.620 --> 55:24.940
 They don't have it.

55:24.940 --> 55:28.720
 And that has influenced their mindset for years now.

55:28.720 --> 55:33.020
 Since 1940, well de Gaulle was the 60s.

55:33.020 --> 55:34.940
 He actually reversed the whole flow

55:34.940 --> 55:38.940
 and I think it was Sarkozy who put France

55:38.940 --> 55:43.940
 back into NATO and now it's Macron.

55:44.740 --> 55:47.320
 I hope because he was talking to Putin

55:47.320 --> 55:50.400
 would at least have an independent viewpoint

55:50.400 --> 55:53.860
 that could be helpful here, so he rolled it up.

55:53.860 --> 55:55.360
 He may have told Putin something else,

55:55.360 --> 55:57.000
 but within days he had rolled it up

55:57.000 --> 55:59.580
 and gone along with the United States position,

55:59.580 --> 56:03.140
 which was enforced by the United States in a very fierce way.

56:03.140 --> 56:05.540
 The propaganda, as I say, I don't know how much time

56:05.540 --> 56:08.300
 you spend in America, but it was vicious

56:08.300 --> 56:10.300
 and everything was anti Russian.

56:10.300 --> 56:11.940
 Russia were killing all these people,

56:11.940 --> 56:16.940
 were shooting down civilians,

56:17.100 --> 56:18.820
 although there was no proof of it.

56:18.820 --> 56:20.780
 There was just, these are the accidents of war,

56:20.780 --> 56:23.540
 but all of a sudden it was a campaign of criminality

56:23.540 --> 56:25.380
 and they were talking about bringing Putin

56:25.380 --> 56:27.700
 into war crime trial.

56:27.700 --> 56:30.700
 Well, why didn't they talk like that when Iraq was going on

56:30.700 --> 56:33.500
 and Bush was killing far more people?

56:33.500 --> 56:35.260
 Or for that matter, why were they not talking

56:35.260 --> 56:39.420
 about the killings in Donbass and Lugansk

56:39.420 --> 56:44.420
 during that 2014 to 2022 period?

56:45.300 --> 56:47.180
 That is what, it's a crime.

56:47.180 --> 56:49.540
 There were so many people that were killed,

56:49.540 --> 56:51.620
 many of them innocent, many of them innocent.

56:51.620 --> 56:54.860
 What would be the way for Vladimir Putin

56:54.860 --> 56:59.860
 to stop the killing in Donbass

57:00.020 --> 57:02.460
 without the invasion of Ukraine?

57:02.460 --> 57:04.460
 That's a very good question and I've asked that

57:04.460 --> 57:06.460
 several times and I don't have the,

57:06.460 --> 57:09.580
 I have not talked to him since about two years now.

57:12.300 --> 57:13.380
 It's a very good question.

57:13.380 --> 57:16.540
 What's the mistakes, what the human mistakes

57:16.540 --> 57:18.340
 and the leadership mistakes made by Vladimir Putin?

57:18.340 --> 57:19.180
 It's a very good question.

57:19.180 --> 57:21.900
 You see, what the American press has not said

57:21.900 --> 57:25.220
 and the Western press has not said is that on February 24,

57:25.220 --> 57:28.660
 was it, that was, on that day when they invaded,

57:28.660 --> 57:31.260
 the day before, if you check the logs

57:31.260 --> 57:35.780
 of the European organization that was supervising,

57:35.780 --> 57:37.820
 was in the field in Ukraine.

57:37.820 --> 57:39.940
 These are neutral observers.

57:39.940 --> 57:43.300
 They were seeing heavier and heavier artillery fire

57:43.300 --> 57:48.300
 going into Donbass from the Ukrainian side.

57:50.860 --> 57:55.540
 So they had, apparently, Ukraine had 110,000 troops

57:55.540 --> 57:56.380
 on the border.

57:56.380 --> 57:59.220
 They were about to invade Donbass, that was the plan.

57:59.220 --> 58:00.740
 That's what I think.

58:00.740 --> 58:05.580
 Russia, because of the buildup on the border of Donbass,

58:05.580 --> 58:09.180
 brought 130, they say 130,000 troops

58:09.180 --> 58:13.180
 to the area near Donbass, right?

58:13.180 --> 58:15.820
 So you have buildup of forces on both sides,

58:15.820 --> 58:18.180
 but you wouldn't know that from reading the press

58:18.180 --> 58:19.020
 in the West.

58:19.020 --> 58:21.900
 You'd believe that the Russians suddenly put all these men

58:21.900 --> 58:26.900
 into the situation with the idea of invading Ukraine,

58:26.980 --> 58:29.460
 not only Donbass, but invading all of Ukraine

58:29.460 --> 58:33.460
 and getting rid of the, decapitating the government there,

58:33.460 --> 58:34.780
 which is all assumption.

58:34.780 --> 58:36.900
 We don't know what they would intend it to do.

58:36.900 --> 58:40.220
 But you, at the time, as in a lot of people,

58:40.220 --> 58:44.780
 thought that all the talk of the invasion,

58:44.780 --> 58:48.460
 Russian invasion of Ukraine, is just propaganda.

58:48.460 --> 58:49.300
 It's not gonna happen.

58:49.300 --> 58:50.500
 It's very unlikely to happen.

58:50.500 --> 58:52.300
 I think many of us thought that the United States

58:52.300 --> 58:54.820
 is building this up into an invasion.

58:54.820 --> 58:58.300
 In other words, that is the nature of false flag operations,

58:58.300 --> 59:00.900
 when you create this propaganda.

59:00.900 --> 59:01.820
 They are gonna invade.

59:01.820 --> 59:02.780
 They are gonna invade.

59:02.780 --> 59:05.620
 And then, when they invaded, the United States

59:05.620 --> 59:07.500
 was completely ready, and all their allies

59:07.500 --> 59:09.840
 were completely ready for the invasion, correct?

59:09.840 --> 59:11.180
 So why did Putin do that?

59:11.180 --> 59:14.100
 He fell into this, theoretically, into this trap

59:14.100 --> 59:16.060
 set by the United States.

59:16.060 --> 59:18.220
 Here you're telling all your allies across the board

59:18.220 --> 59:19.900
 they're gonna invade.

59:19.900 --> 59:21.280
 But you.

59:21.280 --> 59:23.420
 Why do you think he did it?

59:23.420 --> 59:27.020
 So here, is it madness, or is it common

59:27.020 --> 59:29.500
 strategic calculation, perhaps?

59:29.500 --> 59:31.540
 This one I cannot answer you faithfully,

59:31.540 --> 59:34.700
 because, first of all, we don't know what he was told.

59:34.700 --> 59:38.300
 If he was indeed getting the right intelligence estimates,

59:38.300 --> 59:43.300
 from what I said earlier in that essay I wrote,

59:44.220 --> 59:47.660
 you would think he was not well informed, perhaps,

59:47.660 --> 59:51.620
 about the degree of cooperation he would get

59:51.620 --> 59:56.620
 from the Ukrainian Russians in Ukraine.

59:57.200 --> 59:59.380
 That would be one factor, that he wasn't,

1:00:00.300 --> 1:00:03.360
 he didn't assess the operation correctly.

1:00:03.360 --> 1:00:04.540
 Remember this.

1:00:04.540 --> 1:00:09.540
 Mr. Putin has had this cancer, and I think he's licked it,

1:00:09.780 --> 1:00:12.540
 but he's also been isolated because of COVID.

1:00:12.540 --> 1:00:15.020
 And some people would argue that the isolation

1:00:15.020 --> 1:00:18.800
 from normal activity, which he was meeting people

1:00:18.800 --> 1:00:20.980
 face to face, but all of a sudden he was meeting people

1:00:20.980 --> 1:00:23.940
 across the table 100 yards away, or whatever,

1:00:23.940 --> 1:00:26.380
 10 yards away, it was very hard.

1:00:26.380 --> 1:00:30.180
 Perhaps he lost touch with, contact with people.

1:00:30.180 --> 1:00:33.460
 So it's not just power, it's the very simple fact

1:00:33.460 --> 1:00:34.300
 that you're just distant from humans.

1:00:34.300 --> 1:00:36.500
 As I say, I'm speculating, I don't know.

1:00:36.500 --> 1:00:40.580
 I see that, and I also, perhaps he thought in his mind

1:00:40.580 --> 1:00:45.020
 that there would be a faster resolution

1:00:45.020 --> 1:00:48.260
 that the Ukrainian, because the evidence had been

1:00:48.260 --> 1:00:52.500
 that the Ukrainian Russians, the Ukrainian army

1:00:52.500 --> 1:00:56.300
 had folded so many times, and that they were only backed up

1:00:56.300 --> 1:00:57.840
 and they were stiffened by the resistance

1:00:57.840 --> 1:01:02.380
 of the Nazi oriented Azov battalions.

1:01:02.380 --> 1:01:04.260
 That was a factor, of course.

1:01:04.260 --> 1:01:06.100
 And that is a big factor for the Russians

1:01:06.100 --> 1:01:08.820
 because these people are very tough, they rush.

1:01:08.820 --> 1:01:11.460
 See, what people don't understand is that Ukraine,

1:01:11.460 --> 1:01:14.460
 since 2014, has been a terror state.

1:01:14.460 --> 1:01:18.620
 They've been run, anytime a Ukrainian has expressed

1:01:18.620 --> 1:01:23.620
 any understanding of the Russian Ukrainian position,

1:01:25.920 --> 1:01:28.240
 they've been threatened by the state.

1:01:28.240 --> 1:01:32.700
 From 2014 to 2022, there's been a set of hideous murders

1:01:32.700 --> 1:01:34.200
 that people don't even know about in the West.

1:01:34.200 --> 1:01:37.900
 Journalists, people who speak out, liberals,

1:01:37.900 --> 1:01:40.980
 people who, I interviewed Viktor Medvedev,

1:01:40.980 --> 1:01:43.660
 who they make out to be some kind of horrible person,

1:01:43.660 --> 1:01:46.380
 but Medvedev was a very important figure

1:01:46.380 --> 1:01:48.180
 in the administration of Khushma,

1:01:48.180 --> 1:01:52.020
 the first Ukrainian Prime Minister in the 1990s,

1:01:52.020 --> 1:01:54.260
 and he did a great job on the economy.

1:01:54.260 --> 1:01:55.660
 He was a very thoughtful man.

1:01:55.660 --> 1:01:58.260
 If you'll see my interview, it's called Ukraine Revealed.

1:01:58.260 --> 1:02:00.620
 He's very thoughtful about the future of Ukraine.

1:02:00.620 --> 1:02:02.660
 He doesn't want to go back and join Russia.

1:02:02.660 --> 1:02:04.860
 He wants it to be an independent country.

1:02:04.860 --> 1:02:07.740
 Ukraine is independent, and he wants it to be

1:02:07.740 --> 1:02:10.760
 a functioning economic democracy, more or less,

1:02:10.760 --> 1:02:13.900
 a democracy, if you can get that,

1:02:13.900 --> 1:02:15.740
 that exists in a neutral state,

1:02:15.740 --> 1:02:19.500
 a neutral state, which Ukraine used to be before 2014.

1:02:19.500 --> 1:02:24.340
 It was neutral from 1991 to 2014, neutral, very important.

1:02:25.740 --> 1:02:28.700
 Under Poroshenko, it just immediately went

1:02:28.700 --> 1:02:31.740
 into an anti Soviet Cold War position

1:02:31.740 --> 1:02:34.100
 as an ally of the United States,

1:02:34.100 --> 1:02:39.100
 and my point was that it was a very dangerous place

1:02:39.100 --> 1:02:39.940
 in Ukraine.

1:02:39.940 --> 1:02:43.940
 People were being killed, death squads were out there.

1:02:43.940 --> 1:02:47.540
 Medvedev, they stripped him of his television stations

1:02:47.540 --> 1:02:50.620
 very suddenly, this is Zelensky, the new president.

1:02:50.620 --> 1:02:54.460
 Zelensky was elected on a peace platform, remember that.

1:02:54.460 --> 1:02:57.860
 70% of the country was for him to make peace with Russia.

1:02:57.860 --> 1:03:00.780
 Did he ever even try to make peace with Russia?

1:03:00.780 --> 1:03:04.460
 Did he attend any of the Minsk Two agreements?

1:03:04.460 --> 1:03:08.460
 Did he visit, did he pay any attention to the Minsk?

1:03:08.460 --> 1:03:09.660
 Did he pay attention to Putin?

1:03:09.660 --> 1:03:10.500
 Did he go to Russia?

1:03:10.500 --> 1:03:11.900
 No, not at all.

1:03:11.900 --> 1:03:14.580
 The moment he got into office, I'm convinced

1:03:14.580 --> 1:03:19.580
 that the militant sector of the right sector parties

1:03:22.780 --> 1:03:26.900
 of Ukraine let him know that you will not make a deal

1:03:26.900 --> 1:03:30.140
 with Russia, there'll be no concessions to Russia.

1:03:30.140 --> 1:03:31.220
 This is very dangerous.

1:03:31.220 --> 1:03:34.520
 This is where this attitude that's very, very hostile

1:03:34.520 --> 1:03:35.940
 to Russia has hurt us.

1:03:35.940 --> 1:03:37.940
 The whole world is being hurt by this,

1:03:37.940 --> 1:03:40.460
 and no one calls them out.

1:03:40.460 --> 1:03:41.860
 No one calls them out.

1:03:41.860 --> 1:03:45.180
 Zelensky backed off from his platform

1:03:45.180 --> 1:03:47.540
 as running for president, and as president,

1:03:47.540 --> 1:03:50.220
 has been ineffective, did nothing to promote it.

1:03:50.220 --> 1:03:52.180
 On the contrary, went the other way,

1:03:52.180 --> 1:03:56.700
 and seemed to support the Ukrainian aggression.

1:03:56.700 --> 1:03:59.440
 Well, he found his support in this war.

1:03:59.440 --> 1:04:02.820
 You've revealed through your work some of the most honest

1:04:02.820 --> 1:04:04.800
 and dark aspects of war.

1:04:04.800 --> 1:04:07.960
 Nevertheless, this is a war,

1:04:07.960 --> 1:04:10.760
 and there's a humanitarian crisis.

1:04:10.760 --> 1:04:15.760
 Millions of people, refugees, escape in Ukraine.

1:04:16.040 --> 1:04:20.080
 What do you think about the human cost of this war,

1:04:20.080 --> 1:04:24.640
 initiated by whoever, just as you write,

1:04:24.640 --> 1:04:28.960
 whatever the context, whatever NATO, whatever pressure,

1:04:28.960 --> 1:04:32.880
 as you wrote, Russia was wrong to invade.

1:04:32.880 --> 1:04:36.400
 Okay, yeah, let's get back to that original question.

1:04:36.400 --> 1:04:38.320
 You said, what was he thinking at that time?

1:04:38.320 --> 1:04:39.920
 We never answered that.

1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:44.920
 Now, by the way, among those people

1:04:44.920 --> 1:04:48.440
 who've been ruined by this war,

1:04:48.440 --> 1:04:53.120
 you have to include the 2014 to 2022 Ukrainian Russians.

1:04:53.120 --> 1:04:58.120
 14,000 were killed, not necessarily by,

1:04:58.600 --> 1:05:01.080
 some of them by maybe accident and this and that,

1:05:01.080 --> 1:05:02.800
 but certainly a large number of that

1:05:02.800 --> 1:05:05.760
 is responsible to the Ukrainian military

1:05:05.760 --> 1:05:09.120
 and the Nazi related battalions

1:05:09.120 --> 1:05:11.880
 who have done a good job of death squatting that whole area.

1:05:11.880 --> 1:05:13.920
 And remember, I did a film about Salvador.

1:05:13.920 --> 1:05:16.000
 I know a little bit about death squads and how they work,

1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:17.640
 and I know about paramilitaries,

1:05:17.640 --> 1:05:19.920
 because in South America, they're all over the place.

1:05:19.920 --> 1:05:22.800
 America supports, hates Venezuela,

1:05:22.800 --> 1:05:23.920
 goes on about Venezuela,

1:05:23.920 --> 1:05:25.840
 but do they tell you anything about Colombia,

1:05:25.840 --> 1:05:27.040
 its next door neighbor?

1:05:27.040 --> 1:05:30.440
 Colombia for years has been plagued by paramilitaries

1:05:30.440 --> 1:05:32.600
 that are right wing, and the United States has said,

1:05:32.600 --> 1:05:34.360
 nothing about them except occasionally,

1:05:34.360 --> 1:05:36.040
 there's a newspaper report now.

1:05:36.040 --> 1:05:39.720
 So this support of death squads by the United States

1:05:39.720 --> 1:05:40.720
 is all over the world.

1:05:40.720 --> 1:05:43.680
 It's not just in South America and Central America

1:05:43.680 --> 1:05:46.440
 where we see plenty of evidence of it.

1:05:46.440 --> 1:05:48.680
 It's here too, and this is what's horrible

1:05:48.680 --> 1:05:51.960
 about this whole thing, this hypocrisy of America

1:05:51.960 --> 1:05:55.000
 that they can support such evil, such evil.

1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:58.680
 Now, going back to your larger question about,

1:05:59.720 --> 1:06:02.000
 yeah, it's a terrible refugee disaster,

1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:03.880
 but again, we have to get the numbers.

1:06:03.880 --> 1:06:05.520
 Let's get the numbers and get the evidence,

1:06:05.520 --> 1:06:09.080
 because I would ask you, I'm not sure at this point

1:06:09.080 --> 1:06:13.440
 whether more civilians were killed before 2022 in Donbass

1:06:13.440 --> 1:06:15.880
 than have been killed in this latest.

1:06:15.880 --> 1:06:17.880
 So we can't talk about this without,

1:06:17.880 --> 1:06:19.840
 we can't talk about the invasion of Ukraine

1:06:19.840 --> 1:06:21.360
 without considering the full war

1:06:21.360 --> 1:06:24.480
 between Russia and Ukraine since 2014.

1:06:24.480 --> 1:06:26.520
 That's correct, absolutely,

1:06:26.520 --> 1:06:29.560
 and take the toll on both sides,

1:06:29.560 --> 1:06:32.320
 and you might be surprised by the result.

1:06:32.320 --> 1:06:35.440
 I think the Russian military, of course, I'm not there,

1:06:35.440 --> 1:06:37.520
 and I'm not, this is speculation.

1:06:37.520 --> 1:06:39.240
 The Russian military has slowed down,

1:06:39.240 --> 1:06:40.560
 and part of that reason

1:06:40.560 --> 1:06:43.240
 is not to keep the civilian corridors open,

1:06:43.240 --> 1:06:45.160
 and I think the Ukrainian military

1:06:45.160 --> 1:06:47.640
 has made it more difficult on purpose,

1:06:47.640 --> 1:06:49.240
 especially some of these battalions

1:06:49.240 --> 1:06:51.920
 that are death squad battalions have gone out of their way

1:06:51.920 --> 1:06:55.680
 to keep the civilians locked into these cities in danger

1:06:55.680 --> 1:06:58.400
 because it's in their interest to do so.

1:06:58.400 --> 1:07:01.840
 So there's no reason why Ukrainian military,

1:07:01.840 --> 1:07:04.320
 who have killed Ukrainian civilians for years,

1:07:04.320 --> 1:07:06.120
 would change their policies.

1:07:06.120 --> 1:07:08.600
 They would have no compunctions about wiping out,

1:07:08.600 --> 1:07:11.280
 for example, people with white armbands in Bukha.

1:07:12.600 --> 1:07:16.440
 Okay, as to what Putin was thinking at the time,

1:07:16.440 --> 1:07:18.640
 I wondered this, and I still do.

1:07:18.640 --> 1:07:20.920
 I said, okay, so Putin can say,

1:07:22.320 --> 1:07:24.880
 let's say the Ukrainian government

1:07:24.880 --> 1:07:27.720
 wants to now invade Donbass.

1:07:27.720 --> 1:07:30.600
 This is on February 23, and they have artillery,

1:07:30.600 --> 1:07:32.000
 they're peppering the whole place.

1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:35.600
 They're gonna go in, and they're gonna get Donbass back.

1:07:35.600 --> 1:07:36.880
 What do you do?

1:07:36.880 --> 1:07:39.680
 And you have Russian separatists,

1:07:39.680 --> 1:07:42.440
 who are Russian Ukrainians who are on,

1:07:42.440 --> 1:07:44.440
 who are gonna fight.

1:07:47.720 --> 1:07:49.200
 How far do you go in supporting them?

1:07:49.200 --> 1:07:51.640
 Can Russia at this point say, well, we can't help you.

1:07:51.640 --> 1:07:54.080
 You have to get along, you have to somehow,

1:07:54.080 --> 1:07:56.960
 you have to be absorbed by the Kiev,

1:07:56.960 --> 1:07:58.080
 you're gonna be absorbed by them,

1:07:58.080 --> 1:08:00.920
 and they're not gonna give you autonomy,

1:08:00.920 --> 1:08:02.640
 and you have to live with them,

1:08:02.640 --> 1:08:04.440
 and there's gonna be a price to pay.

1:08:04.440 --> 1:08:05.800
 You could do that, and you could also say,

1:08:05.800 --> 1:08:08.120
 well, we open our borders to Donbass.

1:08:08.120 --> 1:08:10.360
 You can come in to our country, you can leave,

1:08:10.360 --> 1:08:12.880
 and we will help you to resettle.

1:08:13.760 --> 1:08:16.360
 And that would be a reasonable approach.

1:08:16.360 --> 1:08:18.640
 So you take it to the next stage, as Putin's thinking.

1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:20.640
 You take it to the next stage.

1:08:20.640 --> 1:08:23.640
 You stall, it's harder for your,

1:08:23.640 --> 1:08:25.040
 of course, there's this pressure on Putin

1:08:25.040 --> 1:08:27.800
 from inside his own government to say,

1:08:27.800 --> 1:08:28.640
 what are you gonna do?

1:08:28.640 --> 1:08:29.840
 I mean, you can't do this,

1:08:29.840 --> 1:08:31.640
 there's a lot of nationalists in Russia.

1:08:31.640 --> 1:08:34.480
 They would certainly bring, it would be to his,

1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:37.320
 they'd say Putin is weak, and that's the biggest rap

1:08:37.320 --> 1:08:39.080
 you can ever give a Russian leader,

1:08:39.080 --> 1:08:41.240
 is you're weak, you can't get anything done.

1:08:41.240 --> 1:08:42.800
 So there would have been some damage,

1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:44.840
 but let's say he goes with that, and he says,

1:08:44.840 --> 1:08:47.840
 okay, we know what the United States intention is.

1:08:47.840 --> 1:08:51.640
 It's to get rid of me, regime change,

1:08:51.640 --> 1:08:53.240
 and to get another Yeltsin in.

1:08:53.240 --> 1:08:54.640
 That's what they want.

1:08:54.640 --> 1:08:55.880
 And they will go to any ends,

1:08:55.880 --> 1:08:58.200
 they will destroy Ukraine if necessary,

1:08:58.200 --> 1:09:00.480
 but they want regime change in Russia.

1:09:00.480 --> 1:09:02.680
 And then after they do that, of course,

1:09:02.680 --> 1:09:03.600
 they'll go after China,

1:09:03.600 --> 1:09:06.240
 but that's the ultimate policy of the United States.

1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:09.560
 This is a country that has no compunctions

1:09:09.560 --> 1:09:11.400
 about going all the way,

1:09:11.400 --> 1:09:14.680
 and it will use hypocrisy and all the news propaganda

1:09:14.680 --> 1:09:16.360
 in the world to get what it wants.

1:09:16.360 --> 1:09:17.760
 This is the equivalent, frankly,

1:09:17.760 --> 1:09:22.760
 of Germany's goals in World War II, world domination.

1:09:22.760 --> 1:09:24.320
 There's no question in my mind,

1:09:24.320 --> 1:09:26.680
 but we're going about it in our way

1:09:26.680 --> 1:09:29.000
 as opposed to Hitler's way.

1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:32.160
 So just to finish your thought, where do they go?

1:09:32.160 --> 1:09:33.120
 What's stage two?

1:09:33.120 --> 1:09:36.880
 Okay, let's say they take, Ukraine takes back Donbas.

1:09:36.880 --> 1:09:40.520
 Let's say people get killed in large quantities.

1:09:40.520 --> 1:09:42.000
 So we now to the next stage,

1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:44.400
 we're finished with the Minsk II agreements

1:09:44.400 --> 1:09:45.840
 that were never adhered to.

1:09:45.840 --> 1:09:46.680
 So what does Russia do?

1:09:46.680 --> 1:09:48.880
 They wait for the next aggression,

1:09:48.880 --> 1:09:52.000
 which is gonna come in one form or another.

1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:54.960
 Perhaps in Georgia, I don't know what happened,

1:09:54.960 --> 1:09:56.480
 what the US is thinking,

1:09:56.480 --> 1:10:01.480
 but the US cannot say Russia has done anything.

1:10:02.080 --> 1:10:05.160
 They have not used violence to stop Donbas

1:10:05.160 --> 1:10:07.920
 from belonging back to Ukraine, right?

1:10:07.920 --> 1:10:10.080
 So you're in a new setup now.

1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:12.240
 It's a whole thing rearranges.

1:10:12.240 --> 1:10:15.560
 Now you have, but you still have nuclear weapons,

1:10:15.560 --> 1:10:17.800
 and you still have a Russian nuclear weapons,

1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:19.520
 and they're serious weapons.

1:10:19.520 --> 1:10:21.560
 They're very well developed, crude,

1:10:21.560 --> 1:10:24.320
 but not as refined as the American nuclear force,

1:10:24.320 --> 1:10:26.720
 but powerful.

1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:27.960
 That becomes another game.

1:10:27.960 --> 1:10:29.560
 Then you open another chess board,

1:10:29.560 --> 1:10:31.720
 and you still haven't been condemned.

1:10:31.720 --> 1:10:33.400
 The sanctions haven't been imposed.

1:10:33.400 --> 1:10:35.440
 That's a new, it's a new game.

1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:36.880
 Could he have done, could he have lived with that?

1:10:36.880 --> 1:10:39.160
 That's the question I ask myself.

1:10:39.160 --> 1:10:41.960
 So you see ultimately Ukraine today

1:10:41.960 --> 1:10:43.960
 as a battleground for the proxy war

1:10:43.960 --> 1:10:45.640
 between Russia and the United States.

1:10:45.640 --> 1:10:49.120
 The United States would have then NATOized Ukraine,

1:10:49.120 --> 1:10:51.360
 or certainly put more weapons in.

1:10:51.360 --> 1:10:53.480
 The United States has already done a lot in Ukraine

1:10:53.480 --> 1:10:57.800
 with intelligence, with training advisors.

1:10:57.800 --> 1:11:00.800
 The intelligence aspect of the Ukrainian army

1:11:00.800 --> 1:11:04.120
 has been raised enormously by the United States contribution.

1:11:04.120 --> 1:11:05.920
 Is it possible for you to steal man,

1:11:05.920 --> 1:11:07.960
 to play devil's advocate against yourself,

1:11:07.960 --> 1:11:11.940
 and say that Vladimir Zelensky

1:11:11.940 --> 1:11:14.920
 is fighting for the sovereignty of his nation?

1:11:14.920 --> 1:11:17.240
 And in a way against Russia,

1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:19.120
 but also against the United States,

1:11:19.120 --> 1:11:21.880
 it just happens that for now, the United States

1:11:21.880 --> 1:11:23.960
 is a useful ally.

1:11:23.960 --> 1:11:27.140
 But ultimately, the man, the leader,

1:11:27.140 --> 1:11:29.640
 is fighting for the sovereignty of his nation.

1:11:29.640 --> 1:11:31.280
 I would think, he thinks so.

1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:33.200
 Yes, and he could say that.

1:11:33.200 --> 1:11:35.240
 But he's not acknowledging that the sovereignty

1:11:35.240 --> 1:11:38.320
 of his nation was stolen in 2014

1:11:38.320 --> 1:11:42.960
 with the coup d'tat that brought this right sector

1:11:42.960 --> 1:11:46.400
 into power, and they have controlled the country since then.

1:11:46.400 --> 1:11:49.120
 It's thuggery, what they've done.

1:11:50.040 --> 1:11:52.080
 The Medvedev case is a case in point.

1:11:52.080 --> 1:11:53.840
 They just take what they need.

1:11:53.840 --> 1:11:55.880
 They go to a house, and they have a,

1:11:55.880 --> 1:11:57.640
 how many people have been killed?

1:11:57.640 --> 1:12:02.640
 Serious people, journalists killed by these battalions.

1:12:02.980 --> 1:12:04.560
 That's what people don't realize.

1:12:04.560 --> 1:12:06.160
 In other words, you can't speak out.

1:12:06.160 --> 1:12:08.440
 A person like me would have been on the death list

1:12:08.440 --> 1:12:10.000
 on day five.

1:12:11.240 --> 1:12:13.480
 There's no opposition to Zelensky,

1:12:13.480 --> 1:12:16.000
 so he doesn't have a real sovereignty.

1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:17.840
 It was a stolen sovereignty.

1:12:17.840 --> 1:12:21.280
 Do you think President Zelensky would accept

1:12:21.280 --> 1:12:24.160
 an interview with you today?

1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:27.720
 Actually, since I made Ukraine on Fire,

1:12:27.720 --> 1:12:29.920
 a documentary which perhaps you've seen,

1:12:29.920 --> 1:12:34.920
 which records the incidents of 2014

1:12:35.040 --> 1:12:37.820
 and the Maidan demonstrations,

1:12:37.820 --> 1:12:40.600
 and shows you the dishonesty behind it,

1:12:40.600 --> 1:12:43.000
 no, I think that they've been very negative,

1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:46.320
 and they would kill me if I was in Ukraine.

1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:48.360
 I mean, they don't have any,

1:12:48.360 --> 1:12:50.400
 these people are very tough.

1:12:50.400 --> 1:12:52.760
 These are as rough as they come, in my opinion,

1:12:52.760 --> 1:12:54.120
 and I've seen rough in my life.

1:12:54.120 --> 1:12:57.920
 I mean, these guys are not playing fair at all.

1:12:57.920 --> 1:12:59.360
 These are death squads.

1:12:59.360 --> 1:13:01.080
 No, I don't think, and Zelensky would have

1:13:01.080 --> 1:13:02.920
 nothing to do with it, but of course,

1:13:02.920 --> 1:13:04.460
 it would be dangerous for me,

1:13:04.460 --> 1:13:07.800
 and they've been very hostile in their policies

1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:11.320
 to any Ukrainians abroad who are also threatened.

1:13:11.320 --> 1:13:12.840
 In other words, you could be in Paris,

1:13:12.840 --> 1:13:16.080
 but if you speak out too much,

1:13:16.080 --> 1:13:18.840
 I think Ukrainians know that they're gonna be targeted,

1:13:18.840 --> 1:13:21.680
 and I think that's part of the reason they don't talk.

1:13:21.680 --> 1:13:24.800
 A lot of them, you have to take the anti Russian line,

1:13:24.800 --> 1:13:26.480
 but I think a lot of them are divided.

1:13:26.480 --> 1:13:29.120
 So you think you would be killed,

1:13:29.120 --> 1:13:31.920
 and Zelensky wouldn't even know about it, so there is?

1:13:31.920 --> 1:13:34.800
 Well, I don't think, if I was killed certainly abroad,

1:13:34.800 --> 1:13:35.880
 no, they wouldn't kill me abroad.

1:13:35.880 --> 1:13:37.600
 I think they'd figure out a way.

1:13:37.600 --> 1:13:40.360
 No, no, no, no, if you traveled to Ukraine, I mean.

1:13:40.360 --> 1:13:42.600
 I wouldn't get in, I wouldn't get in,

1:13:42.600 --> 1:13:44.520
 except through Donbass, I'd come through.

1:13:44.520 --> 1:13:46.160
 There are some Americans in Donbass

1:13:46.160 --> 1:13:48.080
 who are reporting on the war there,

1:13:48.080 --> 1:13:49.640
 and I read their reports, actually.

1:13:49.640 --> 1:13:50.820
 They're pretty interesting,

1:13:50.820 --> 1:13:53.180
 because they show you the cruelty of what's going on,

1:13:53.180 --> 1:13:55.440
 but never mentioned in the West, never.

1:13:55.440 --> 1:13:58.200
 That's what's so strange about this.

1:13:58.200 --> 1:13:59.920
 This is a modern world that we're living in,

1:13:59.920 --> 1:14:02.020
 and yet this information is not coming out

1:14:02.020 --> 1:14:03.520
 to the mass of the people,

1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:06.700
 and on the contrary, the United States has closed down

1:14:06.700 --> 1:14:11.700
 all the information centers that are possible

1:14:11.700 --> 1:14:15.060
 to alternative news getting to the American people.

1:14:15.060 --> 1:14:16.420
 They've seriously made an effort,

1:14:16.420 --> 1:14:20.060
 and the BBC, English, and France.

1:14:20.060 --> 1:14:22.400
 I was shocked when France closed RT down,

1:14:22.400 --> 1:14:24.380
 because RT is actually pretty good.

1:14:24.380 --> 1:14:27.200
 Yes, they may, it's called, there are distortions,

1:14:27.200 --> 1:14:29.140
 but you know as well as I do, because you hear,

1:14:29.140 --> 1:14:33.260
 you speak that RT has done a very brave job

1:14:33.260 --> 1:14:35.320
 of putting correspondents into the field

1:14:35.320 --> 1:14:36.620
 in very dangerous positions,

1:14:36.620 --> 1:14:38.620
 and they've gotten great footage

1:14:38.620 --> 1:14:40.760
 of some of the violence that's going on.

1:14:40.760 --> 1:14:43.720
 Well, given the wall of propaganda in the West,

1:14:43.720 --> 1:14:47.380
 I also see the wall of propaganda in Russia,

1:14:47.380 --> 1:14:49.380
 the wall of propaganda in China,

1:14:49.380 --> 1:14:51.900
 the wall of propaganda in India.

1:14:51.900 --> 1:14:54.220
 What do we do with these walls of propaganda?

1:14:54.220 --> 1:14:55.460
 Yes, let's talk about Russia,

1:14:55.460 --> 1:14:57.320
 because you would know more about it,

1:14:57.320 --> 1:15:00.740
 but my last experience there, newspapers,

1:15:00.740 --> 1:15:03.400
 it was more interesting, put it this way,

1:15:03.400 --> 1:15:06.540
 when I went to Venezuela, the United States was saying

1:15:06.540 --> 1:15:09.300
 back then that Chavez controlled the press.

1:15:09.300 --> 1:15:11.660
 I get to Venezuela, and there's nothing but criticism

1:15:11.660 --> 1:15:12.940
 of Chavez in the press.

1:15:12.940 --> 1:15:16.300
 It was owned by the oligarchs of Venezuela,

1:15:16.300 --> 1:15:18.640
 and who hated him, so it was across the board.

1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:22.540
 That's why Chavez opened the state television,

1:15:22.540 --> 1:15:26.180
 spent more money on it, and advertised his point of view

1:15:26.180 --> 1:15:27.620
 through state television.

1:15:27.620 --> 1:15:32.180
 But in Russia, there is, what I saw was criticism.

1:15:32.180 --> 1:15:34.480
 I met with a publisher who got the Nobel Prize

1:15:34.480 --> 1:15:38.100
 of that famous newspaper, and his point of view

1:15:38.100 --> 1:15:40.300
 at that time when I spoke to him a few years ago

1:15:40.300 --> 1:15:44.320
 was we're operating, there is criticism of him,

1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:48.060
 but you can't call for the overthrow of the government,

1:15:48.060 --> 1:15:50.700
 nor in Venezuela, nor in the United States for that matter.

1:15:50.700 --> 1:15:53.060
 If you call for the overthrow of the government

1:15:53.060 --> 1:15:55.540
 of the United States, you're gonna be in deep trouble.

1:15:55.540 --> 1:15:57.860
 Well, all right, so to push back on that,

1:15:57.860 --> 1:15:59.620
 it's interesting, it's so interesting,

1:15:59.620 --> 1:16:02.540
 because we mentioned Elon Musk,

1:16:02.540 --> 1:16:06.480
 and there's a way that people sound when they speak freely.

1:16:06.480 --> 1:16:09.580
 When I speak to, I have family in Ukraine,

1:16:09.580 --> 1:16:11.140
 I have family in Russia.

1:16:11.140 --> 1:16:12.820
 When I speak to people in Russia,

1:16:12.820 --> 1:16:14.100
 let's put my family aside,

1:16:14.100 --> 1:16:15.740
 when I speak to people in Russia,

1:16:16.940 --> 1:16:20.200
 I think there's fear.

1:16:21.300 --> 1:16:23.440
 I think they don't,

1:16:25.860 --> 1:16:28.380
 sometimes when you call for the overthrow of government,

1:16:28.380 --> 1:16:30.860
 that's important, not because you necessarily believe

1:16:30.860 --> 1:16:32.720
 for the overthrow of the government,

1:16:32.720 --> 1:16:36.820
 but you just need to test the power centers

1:16:36.820 --> 1:16:41.060
 and make sure they're responsive to the people.

1:16:41.060 --> 1:16:44.580
 And I feel like there's a mix of fear and apathy

1:16:47.380 --> 1:16:51.140
 that has a different texture than it does

1:16:51.140 --> 1:16:52.440
 in the United States.

1:16:53.620 --> 1:16:58.620
 That worries me, because I would like to see

1:16:58.980 --> 1:17:01.520
 the flourishing of a people in all places.

1:17:01.520 --> 1:17:05.460
 Well, as I said, my impression was that there's far more

1:17:05.460 --> 1:17:08.980
 freedom in the press than was pictured by the West,

1:17:08.980 --> 1:17:10.900
 and that means different points of view,

1:17:10.900 --> 1:17:12.660
 because the Russians are always arguing with themselves.

1:17:12.660 --> 1:17:14.580
 I've never seen a country that's so contentious.

1:17:14.580 --> 1:17:19.580
 There's more intellectuals in Moscow and the cities

1:17:19.700 --> 1:17:23.420
 than you can believe, and you know the Russian people there.

1:17:23.420 --> 1:17:25.620
 They've been fighting government for years,

1:17:25.620 --> 1:17:27.680
 back from the 1870s, it was czarist times,

1:17:27.680 --> 1:17:30.260
 they're always plotting against the government,

1:17:30.260 --> 1:17:32.900
 and the intelligentsia has known through history

1:17:32.900 --> 1:17:37.140
 as being contentious and anti government in many ways.

1:17:37.140 --> 1:17:39.180
 And we see the same thing,

1:17:39.180 --> 1:17:40.860
 educated people turning against Russia.

1:17:40.860 --> 1:17:41.980
 I don't appreciate those people,

1:17:41.980 --> 1:17:43.900
 because I think they're very spoiled,

1:17:43.900 --> 1:17:45.280
 and they don't understand some of the stuff

1:17:45.280 --> 1:17:46.620
 that's going on in the West.

1:17:46.620 --> 1:17:51.100
 But we have a lot of Russians in Europe and America

1:17:51.100 --> 1:17:55.060
 that attack Russia and sometimes don't understand

1:17:55.060 --> 1:17:57.240
 that they are under pressure from the United States,

1:17:57.240 --> 1:17:59.940
 and they don't understand the size of the pressure.

1:17:59.940 --> 1:18:02.480
 And that's why Putin connects with the people,

1:18:02.480 --> 1:18:05.860
 because he represents the common,

1:18:05.860 --> 1:18:08.820
 more the common man who's saying to you,

1:18:08.820 --> 1:18:11.980
 your interests are threatened, Russia is threatened.

1:18:11.980 --> 1:18:14.220
 We are representing only the interests of Russia,

1:18:14.220 --> 1:18:16.940
 not, we're not an empire, we're not gonna expand.

1:18:16.940 --> 1:18:19.000
 He has no empire intentions,

1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:20.940
 although the West paints it as empire.

1:18:21.940 --> 1:18:24.180
 I see no evidence of it.

1:18:24.180 --> 1:18:26.020
 Why didn't he do something in all these years?

1:18:26.020 --> 1:18:29.140
 Nothing, he did nothing except defend the country

1:18:29.140 --> 1:18:30.980
 in Georgia and in Chechnya.

1:18:30.980 --> 1:18:33.820
 So the imperialist imperative is coming more

1:18:33.820 --> 1:18:34.660
 from the West.

1:18:34.660 --> 1:18:37.420
 It's the imperialist, it's the imperialist agenda.

1:18:37.420 --> 1:18:40.620
 Going back to, I'm sorry, where we left our discussion off,

1:18:40.620 --> 1:18:42.780
 I mean, I was gonna go on with America

1:18:42.780 --> 1:18:47.620
 not only being censored, closed down now, closed down.

1:18:47.620 --> 1:18:50.180
 And you say it's not fear, well, it is fear.

1:18:50.180 --> 1:18:53.900
 I am scared, because if you get your Facebook page

1:18:53.900 --> 1:18:58.220
 suspended or your YouTube, your Twitter account thrown off,

1:18:58.220 --> 1:19:02.020
 a lot of good people are getting there, thrown off.

1:19:02.020 --> 1:19:04.460
 You can't speak out, it affects your business.

1:19:04.460 --> 1:19:07.660
 It goes back to the 1950s when my father's world,

1:19:07.660 --> 1:19:12.620
 when you could not express any sympathy for a Soviet Union

1:19:12.620 --> 1:19:14.220
 without endangering your job,

1:19:14.220 --> 1:19:16.380
 without basically being not trusted.

1:19:16.380 --> 1:19:20.700
 You had to be part of the program to get along, to go along.

1:19:20.700 --> 1:19:22.660
 Same thing when the United Kingdom,

1:19:22.660 --> 1:19:26.300
 I mean, for all their talk, this Boris Johnson is an idiot.

1:19:26.300 --> 1:19:29.220
 But all their talk about, do you remember their policies

1:19:29.220 --> 1:19:32.260
 with the IRA in Ireland when Ireland was threatening them?

1:19:32.260 --> 1:19:34.140
 They cut off the IRA completely.

1:19:34.140 --> 1:19:37.860
 Gerry Adams, who was a wonderful guy, I met him,

1:19:37.860 --> 1:19:40.260
 was not allowed to even be heard in Britain

1:19:40.260 --> 1:19:41.220
 during certain years.

1:19:41.220 --> 1:19:44.620
 In France, all constantly through the Algerian War,

1:19:44.620 --> 1:19:46.660
 the Algerians were not allowed to be heard.

1:19:46.660 --> 1:19:51.060
 The Algerian War for Independence divided France greatly.

1:19:51.060 --> 1:19:52.820
 You could not even show Paths of Glory,

1:19:52.820 --> 1:19:56.820
 World War I film in France for, I don't know, 20 years

1:19:56.820 --> 1:19:57.900
 after it came out.

1:19:58.980 --> 1:20:00.380
 Censorship is a way of life

1:20:00.380 --> 1:20:02.940
 when democracies also feel threatened.

1:20:02.940 --> 1:20:05.300
 They are much more fragile than they pretend to be.

1:20:05.300 --> 1:20:07.500
 A healthy democracy would take all the criticism

1:20:07.500 --> 1:20:09.300
 in the world and shrug it off and say,

1:20:09.300 --> 1:20:11.340
 okay, that's what's good about our country.

1:20:11.340 --> 1:20:13.340
 Well, I'd like to see that in America.

1:20:13.340 --> 1:20:15.260
 There are times that it's been like that,

1:20:15.260 --> 1:20:17.860
 but it's so scary now.

1:20:17.860 --> 1:20:20.020
 So it is scary, that's what I was trying to say.

1:20:20.020 --> 1:20:22.940
 It's not unscary to me.

1:20:22.940 --> 1:20:26.260
 In China, I would say to you, yes, it's much scarier to me

1:20:26.260 --> 1:20:30.260
 because there is the internet wall that they cut off,

1:20:30.260 --> 1:20:32.620
 and I got into problems in China too

1:20:32.620 --> 1:20:34.700
 because I said something years ago

1:20:34.700 --> 1:20:37.100
 about you have to discover your own history.

1:20:37.100 --> 1:20:38.500
 You have to be honest about Mao.

1:20:38.500 --> 1:20:42.060
 You have to go back and let's make a movie about Mao.

1:20:42.060 --> 1:20:45.740
 That upset them and show his negatives.

1:20:46.900 --> 1:20:49.300
 So China has been much more sensitive than Russia

1:20:49.300 --> 1:20:51.460
 about criticism, much more.

1:20:51.460 --> 1:20:54.020
 And it is a source of problems, but on the other hand,

1:20:54.020 --> 1:20:56.660
 China has a lot of grievances,

1:20:56.660 --> 1:20:58.700
 a lot going back to the 19th century

1:20:58.700 --> 1:21:01.020
 and the British imperialism of that era

1:21:01.020 --> 1:21:02.620
 and the American imperialism.

1:21:02.620 --> 1:21:07.620
 If you could talk to Vladimir Putin once again now,

1:21:07.620 --> 1:21:11.580
 what kind of things would you talk about here?

1:21:11.580 --> 1:21:13.500
 What kind of questions would you ask?

1:21:13.500 --> 1:21:18.500
 Huh, well, one thing I would certainly ask

1:21:19.300 --> 1:21:21.940
 is what you were thinking on February 23,

1:21:21.940 --> 1:21:24.340
 and I would ask him to reply to my question

1:21:24.340 --> 1:21:26.580
 about what if you took this to phase two.

1:21:26.580 --> 1:21:28.900
 You surrendered in Donbass.

1:21:28.900 --> 1:21:30.580
 You had no ego about it.

1:21:30.580 --> 1:21:31.420
 You just surrendered.

1:21:31.420 --> 1:21:33.140
 It's in your interest to your country,

1:21:33.140 --> 1:21:36.780
 and you invited all the refugees from Donbass into Russia

1:21:36.780 --> 1:21:38.020
 as much as they can.

1:21:38.900 --> 1:21:40.500
 What would you do now?

1:21:40.500 --> 1:21:43.780
 What's the US next move in your opinion?

1:21:43.780 --> 1:21:46.740
 How are you gonna, okay, where are we gonna go?

1:21:46.740 --> 1:21:48.940
 That would be the key question because it's,

1:21:50.020 --> 1:21:51.020
 but he didn't go that way.

1:21:51.020 --> 1:21:56.020
 He chose to take the sanctions and to go this way.

1:21:56.020 --> 1:21:58.540
 Why he did that is a key question for our time.

1:22:00.460 --> 1:22:01.620
 Perhaps it was a mistake.

1:22:01.620 --> 1:22:03.260
 Perhaps it was his judgment.

1:22:03.260 --> 1:22:05.340
 Perhaps, as I said, but I don't,

1:22:05.340 --> 1:22:07.300
 knowing the man I did, I don't think so.

1:22:07.300 --> 1:22:09.420
 I think it was calculated.

1:22:09.420 --> 1:22:12.380
 Now this is projection and speculation,

1:22:12.380 --> 1:22:14.620
 but there's something different about him

1:22:14.620 --> 1:22:16.820
 in the past several months.

1:22:16.820 --> 1:22:17.980
 It could be the COVID thing,

1:22:17.980 --> 1:22:20.180
 the isolation that you mentioned.

1:22:20.180 --> 1:22:23.940
 I listen to a lot of interviews and speeches in Russian,

1:22:23.940 --> 1:22:28.120
 and there's something about power over time

1:22:28.120 --> 1:22:30.620
 that can change you, that can isolate you.

1:22:30.620 --> 1:22:31.860
 Well, when I was there,

1:22:31.860 --> 1:22:35.820
 no, he'd been in office for already 15 years.

1:22:35.820 --> 1:22:37.140
 He had power.

1:22:37.140 --> 1:22:38.700
 He didn't misuse it in my opinion.

1:22:38.700 --> 1:22:39.540
 He was very even.

1:22:39.540 --> 1:22:42.220
 I saw him go on television and talk to his fellows

1:22:42.220 --> 1:22:44.180
 the same way he always talked to them.

1:22:44.180 --> 1:22:47.700
 He grew in intelligence and knowledge

1:22:47.700 --> 1:22:50.540
 because he had dealings with the whole world.

1:22:50.540 --> 1:22:52.260
 Now people had come to him.

1:22:52.260 --> 1:22:55.620
 He was very well known in Africa and Middle East,

1:22:55.620 --> 1:23:00.620
 certainly Syria, and I just never saw misuse of his power.

1:23:01.780 --> 1:23:03.940
 I saw humility in him, actually.

1:23:03.940 --> 1:23:08.940
 So perhaps there was a calculation and he calculated wrong

1:23:09.180 --> 1:23:12.620
 in terms of what happens if he doesn't invade.

1:23:12.620 --> 1:23:14.060
 Perhaps there was a calculation,

1:23:14.060 --> 1:23:16.900
 perhaps he had a calm and clear mind,

1:23:16.900 --> 1:23:18.360
 and he calculated wrong.

1:23:18.360 --> 1:23:20.380
 Well, he also made the point that he,

1:23:20.380 --> 1:23:22.780
 the talk of Zelensky saying,

1:23:22.780 --> 1:23:25.180
 well, nuclear weapons were gonna come into Ukraine.

1:23:25.180 --> 1:23:28.260
 There was talk about that right before the invasion too,

1:23:28.260 --> 1:23:30.980
 and certainly that would have set off alarms.

1:23:30.980 --> 1:23:34.000
 You know, the United States is already kind of doing that

1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:36.460
 by not only putting its intelligence

1:23:36.460 --> 1:23:39.660
 and its heavy weaponry into Ukraine,

1:23:39.660 --> 1:23:41.300
 but you've got to deal with the question,

1:23:41.300 --> 1:23:42.480
 the next question that comes up,

1:23:42.480 --> 1:23:44.600
 the most immediate question is,

1:23:44.600 --> 1:23:47.680
 is the United States gonna start?

1:23:47.680 --> 1:23:50.420
 And I'm saying this is good.

1:23:50.420 --> 1:23:52.660
 They're making a lot of noise in United States press

1:23:52.660 --> 1:23:56.360
 about Russia using nuclear weapons and chemical weapons.

1:23:56.360 --> 1:23:58.460
 That's a lot of noise.

1:23:58.460 --> 1:24:00.580
 Again, going back to my analogy,

1:24:00.580 --> 1:24:02.100
 when the United States starts that,

1:24:02.100 --> 1:24:04.280
 it starts the conversation going.

1:24:04.280 --> 1:24:06.380
 It's in the interest of the United States

1:24:07.380 --> 1:24:11.580
 for Russia to be pinned with any kind of chemical

1:24:12.980 --> 1:24:16.560
 or nuclear incident.

1:24:16.560 --> 1:24:19.560
 Except, for example, it'd be very, not simple,

1:24:19.560 --> 1:24:23.380
 but it would be possible to explode a nuclear device

1:24:23.380 --> 1:24:26.620
 in Donbass and kill thousands of people.

1:24:27.520 --> 1:24:29.740
 And we would not know right away who did it,

1:24:29.740 --> 1:24:32.380
 but of course the blame would go right to Russia,

1:24:32.380 --> 1:24:34.460
 right to Russia, even if it didn't make sense,

1:24:34.460 --> 1:24:36.320
 if there was no motivation for it.

1:24:36.320 --> 1:24:38.340
 It would just be blamed on Russia.

1:24:38.340 --> 1:24:40.140
 The United States might well be the one

1:24:40.140 --> 1:24:42.540
 who does that false flag operation.

1:24:42.540 --> 1:24:44.580
 It would not be beyond them.

1:24:44.580 --> 1:24:48.240
 It would be a very dramatic solution

1:24:48.240 --> 1:24:50.700
 to sealing this war off as a major victory

1:24:50.700 --> 1:24:51.540
 for the United States.

1:24:51.540 --> 1:24:52.700
 That's terrifying.

1:24:52.700 --> 1:24:53.740
 No, but it can happen.

1:24:53.740 --> 1:24:54.580
 It can happen.

1:24:54.580 --> 1:24:59.260
 A one kiloton device, low yield, it's possible.

1:24:59.260 --> 1:25:01.860
 So when you walk across that line,

1:25:01.860 --> 1:25:05.020
 you can potentially never walk back.

1:25:05.020 --> 1:25:07.540
 Well, I think the United States is calculating

1:25:07.540 --> 1:25:10.520
 that it's a dangerous, yes, I agree,

1:25:10.520 --> 1:25:13.460
 but I think the neoconservative arrogance is such

1:25:13.460 --> 1:25:16.300
 that they really believe they can push their advantage

1:25:16.300 --> 1:25:20.340
 to the max now because of all these propaganda successes

1:25:20.340 --> 1:25:21.500
 up to now.

1:25:21.500 --> 1:25:23.780
 The Ukrainian army could be wiped out for all we know.

1:25:23.780 --> 1:25:25.960
 There's all this leftists or neo, Nazi brigades,

1:25:25.960 --> 1:25:29.580
 but they're being advised very well by US

1:25:29.580 --> 1:25:30.860
 and they're sending the weapons in,

1:25:30.860 --> 1:25:31.940
 are huge amounts of weapons.

1:25:31.940 --> 1:25:33.020
 What about American budget?

1:25:33.020 --> 1:25:36.020
 No one talks about how much money we're giving to Ukraine.

1:25:36.900 --> 1:25:39.200
 It's a billion dollars already in weaponry

1:25:39.200 --> 1:25:41.780
 and not most of it just poured in.

1:25:41.780 --> 1:25:45.900
 What about, you know, the Russian budget is,

1:25:47.440 --> 1:25:51.060
 defense budget is 60 some billion dollars a year.

1:25:51.060 --> 1:25:54.780
 It's nothing compared to the United States, 1 15th of it.

1:25:54.780 --> 1:25:59.020
 But yet we've put so much weaponry into Ukraine.

1:25:59.020 --> 1:26:03.060
 The money we've spent on Ukraine is equivalent almost

1:26:03.060 --> 1:26:07.060
 to what we spent on COVID in our own country.

1:26:07.060 --> 1:26:10.700
 It's astounding the distortion of our priorities.

1:26:11.700 --> 1:26:12.860
 There's also chemical.

1:26:12.860 --> 1:26:15.820
 Don't forget chemical is probably the easier way to go.

1:26:15.820 --> 1:26:20.500
 But in Syria, there was far too many incidents of America

1:26:20.500 --> 1:26:25.500
 in its quest to demonize Assad and the Russians

1:26:25.660 --> 1:26:27.980
 of all these chemical attacks that were happening

1:26:27.980 --> 1:26:31.140
 that they were vowing came from Russia.

1:26:31.140 --> 1:26:36.140
 And in spite of the fact that Russia just pulled out of the,

1:26:36.660 --> 1:26:38.460
 signed the agreement on chemical arms

1:26:38.460 --> 1:26:42.540
 and apparently destroyed its stock several years ago,

1:26:43.780 --> 1:26:47.660
 it's strange that the strangest incidents happened in Syria.

1:26:47.660 --> 1:26:50.300
 You go back to them, trace every one,

1:26:50.300 --> 1:26:51.900
 good journalism was done.

1:26:51.900 --> 1:26:53.620
 The White Helmets got a lot of fame,

1:26:53.620 --> 1:26:55.060
 but they were corrupted.

1:26:55.060 --> 1:26:58.060
 And many good journalists tried to point out

1:26:58.060 --> 1:27:01.780
 the inconsistencies in the American accusations.

1:27:04.140 --> 1:27:05.780
 Robert Parry among them,

1:27:05.780 --> 1:27:08.620
 who was one of my mentors at Consortium Press.

1:27:08.620 --> 1:27:10.100
 A lot of good, you'd have to go back,

1:27:10.100 --> 1:27:13.420
 but trace each, like you would trace each time

1:27:13.420 --> 1:27:16.020
 they made an accusation against Putin of murder.

1:27:16.020 --> 1:27:19.660
 You need that same kind of Sherlock Holmes intensity,

1:27:19.660 --> 1:27:21.740
 investigation, and they don't do it

1:27:21.740 --> 1:27:24.660
 because the United Nations or the chemical,

1:27:24.660 --> 1:27:27.020
 not the United Nations as much as the chemical people,

1:27:27.020 --> 1:27:30.740
 the organization has been tampered with.

1:27:30.740 --> 1:27:33.220
 If you remember correctly, there was accusations

1:27:33.220 --> 1:27:36.780
 that the chemical investigative unit,

1:27:36.780 --> 1:27:39.980
 I don't know the name of it, was tampered with.

1:27:39.980 --> 1:27:42.900
 And people quit, people who were working on that commission

1:27:42.900 --> 1:27:45.380
 quit and said that this is not legit.

1:27:45.380 --> 1:27:48.780
 So very interesting, that Syria story is wacko.

1:27:48.780 --> 1:27:49.900
 So the United States is willing

1:27:49.900 --> 1:27:52.300
 to use chemical in Syria freely.

1:27:52.300 --> 1:27:53.340
 It did it three, four times.

1:27:53.340 --> 1:27:55.420
 If you remember correctly, Trump was challenged

1:27:55.420 --> 1:27:59.980
 that he did not attack after a chemical incident in Syria.

1:27:59.980 --> 1:28:02.460
 All these newscasters in the United States,

1:28:02.460 --> 1:28:04.700
 the most heaviest of them were saying,

1:28:04.700 --> 1:28:08.860
 well, President Trump is now finally acting

1:28:08.860 --> 1:28:11.180
 like a real president when he attacks,

1:28:11.180 --> 1:28:12.900
 when he drops missiles in Syria.

1:28:12.900 --> 1:28:14.300
 They actually said that.

1:28:14.300 --> 1:28:17.140
 In other words, they wanted Trump to go to war on Syria,

1:28:17.140 --> 1:28:17.980
 but he didn't.

1:28:17.980 --> 1:28:22.980
 Chemical weapons and nuclear is really terrifying.

1:28:23.260 --> 1:28:28.260
 Do you think, now combine this with the fascinating choice

1:28:28.740 --> 1:28:31.260
 in your interviews with Vladimir Putin

1:28:31.260 --> 1:28:36.260
 to watch Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove

1:28:36.300 --> 1:28:38.860
 or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.

1:28:38.860 --> 1:28:42.180
 And given the fact that you did that,

1:28:42.180 --> 1:28:46.380
 now looking at the fact that the word nuclear,

1:28:46.380 --> 1:28:49.820
 and it feels like the world hangs

1:28:49.820 --> 1:28:52.180
 on the brink of nuclear war,

1:28:52.180 --> 1:28:55.740
 do you think that that's overstating the case?

1:28:55.740 --> 1:28:58.300
 No, that's what worried me from the beginning,

1:28:58.300 --> 1:29:00.580
 and that's probably why I got involved in all this stuff,

1:29:00.580 --> 1:29:05.580
 because I go back to the 60s when we were so close

1:29:06.320 --> 1:29:07.440
 to nuclear war.

1:29:07.440 --> 1:29:08.720
 I lived through that period,

1:29:08.720 --> 1:29:11.220
 and I thought, as many people did,

1:29:11.220 --> 1:29:14.900
 that this was, it was gonna come now.

1:29:14.900 --> 1:29:16.620
 So I've lived through that,

1:29:16.620 --> 1:29:19.700
 and I didn't sense the period in 83

1:29:19.700 --> 1:29:21.540
 when Reagan took us to the edge,

1:29:21.540 --> 1:29:22.500
 if you remember correctly.

1:29:22.500 --> 1:29:26.380
 Able Archer was an exercise that almost brought us to,

1:29:26.380 --> 1:29:29.240
 because the Russians were really paranoid at that point,

1:29:29.240 --> 1:29:32.860
 and they were responding to our military exercise

1:29:32.860 --> 1:29:33.700
 on Able Archer.

1:29:33.700 --> 1:29:35.580
 There was also the Korean airliner, they went down.

1:29:35.580 --> 1:29:37.500
 There were numerous incidents in the 80s,

1:29:37.500 --> 1:29:39.240
 but I never felt the fear.

1:29:40.200 --> 1:29:43.300
 I thought Reagan was testing the limits,

1:29:43.300 --> 1:29:46.240
 but perhaps if I'd been younger, I would've felt it.

1:29:46.240 --> 1:29:48.340
 But anyway, no, we come close.

1:29:48.340 --> 1:29:51.380
 The United States has risked this several times.

1:29:51.380 --> 1:29:53.540
 If I told you, it would be hard for you to believe,

1:29:53.540 --> 1:29:57.980
 if I could set a scene for you in a drama in 1962

1:29:57.980 --> 1:30:01.180
 when Kennedy has a meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff

1:30:01.180 --> 1:30:06.180
 and the CIA, and they talk about a plan,

1:30:06.220 --> 1:30:11.220
 a military plan, to first strike the Soviet Union and China.

1:30:11.220 --> 1:30:16.220
 It was an Eisenhower plan that had been put into potential

1:30:18.820 --> 1:30:23.820
 operation in early 60s or 50s, late 50s, SIOP 62.

1:30:27.060 --> 1:30:29.820
 This was an attack on the Soviet Union, first strike.

1:30:29.820 --> 1:30:32.220
 That's why the United States has never given up

1:30:32.220 --> 1:30:33.760
 the concept of first strike.

1:30:34.700 --> 1:30:38.520
 It's interesting that the Russian nuclear policy posture

1:30:38.520 --> 1:30:41.860
 is more defensive than the American one,

1:30:41.860 --> 1:30:43.500
 which leaves options open.

1:30:44.900 --> 1:30:49.300
 The same options are open in neoconservative agreements

1:30:49.300 --> 1:30:52.460
 that we see from the late 90s, where they say,

1:30:52.460 --> 1:30:56.140
 the emergence of a rival power will not be tolerated.

1:30:56.140 --> 1:30:58.260
 That's a very broad statement,

1:30:58.260 --> 1:31:01.780
 and it allows you to do a lot, including nuclear.

1:31:01.780 --> 1:31:05.620
 So you have to understand the United States is always,

1:31:05.620 --> 1:31:07.900
 first of all, it breaks so many treaties.

1:31:07.900 --> 1:31:10.180
 We know that from the Putin story

1:31:10.180 --> 1:31:13.940
 about the Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002,

1:31:13.940 --> 1:31:17.240
 and then the INF Treaty of, they broke that one.

1:31:17.240 --> 1:31:19.980
 That was the intermediate missiles.

1:31:19.980 --> 1:31:21.380
 That was 2019.

1:31:21.380 --> 1:31:22.920
 I don't know when they broke it off,

1:31:22.920 --> 1:31:25.040
 but the United States has not been very faithful

1:31:25.040 --> 1:31:29.560
 on its nuclear agreements, and so I don't know

1:31:29.560 --> 1:31:32.140
 that we can even deal with the United States diplomatically.

1:31:32.140 --> 1:31:34.220
 It seems to be impossible.

1:31:34.220 --> 1:31:36.240
 Now, it brings me to Biden.

1:31:36.240 --> 1:31:40.220
 And this is the opposite of Kennedy.

1:31:40.220 --> 1:31:43.820
 Kennedy was a Catholic Irish anti imperialist.

1:31:43.820 --> 1:31:45.300
 Biden seems to be the opposite.

1:31:45.300 --> 1:31:48.300
 He seems to be a get along, go along guy

1:31:48.300 --> 1:31:50.780
 who's been not only old,

1:31:50.780 --> 1:31:52.760
 but he's also gone along with this program,

1:31:52.760 --> 1:31:56.140
 which I voted for Biden because I feared Trump,

1:31:56.140 --> 1:31:59.020
 but I thought Biden at a certain age would mellow.

1:31:59.020 --> 1:32:00.260
 I really did.

1:32:00.260 --> 1:32:01.620
 He's not mellowed, apparently.

1:32:01.620 --> 1:32:05.040
 He's still listening to these people, and he believes them.

1:32:05.040 --> 1:32:08.300
 And it seems that his, that horrible woman,

1:32:08.300 --> 1:32:10.540
 Victoria Nuland, who was Under Secretary of State,

1:32:10.540 --> 1:32:14.580
 he appointed her to this sector of the world.

1:32:14.580 --> 1:32:16.020
 She's very influential,

1:32:16.020 --> 1:32:19.460
 and she's been one of the worst people on Ukraine.

1:32:19.460 --> 1:32:21.860
 Obviously, she's behind the coup.

1:32:21.860 --> 1:32:24.740
 She was the one who boasted that, you know,

1:32:24.740 --> 1:32:28.780
 we got our man in, Yats, whatever it is, Yatsenuk.

1:32:28.780 --> 1:32:32.780
 And also, remember the famous statement, fuck the EU?

1:32:32.780 --> 1:32:34.400
 All these things, but she's back,

1:32:34.400 --> 1:32:37.340
 and she said the other day about if the Soviets,

1:32:37.340 --> 1:32:41.440
 if the Russians use nuclear weaponry of any kind,

1:32:41.440 --> 1:32:44.020
 there's gonna be a horrible price to pay.

1:32:44.020 --> 1:32:44.900
 She was out of the blue.

1:32:44.900 --> 1:32:46.660
 I said, what the hell is she doing?

1:32:46.660 --> 1:32:48.660
 She's talking nuclear all of a sudden.

1:32:48.660 --> 1:32:52.780
 And then since that day, everybody in the US press,

1:32:52.780 --> 1:32:55.620
 all the shows have gone, talk nuclear, nuclear, nuclear.

1:32:55.620 --> 1:33:04.620
 Secretary of State has done it, Blinken, it scares you.

1:33:05.580 --> 1:33:08.300
 If you think about it, the United States scares me.

1:33:08.300 --> 1:33:11.300
 So that's the military industrial complex machine,

1:33:11.300 --> 1:33:13.220
 fully functional, fully operational

1:33:13.220 --> 1:33:14.140
 behind this whole thing.

1:33:14.140 --> 1:33:14.980
 Certainly is.

1:33:14.980 --> 1:33:16.220
 Is that what's to blame?

1:33:16.220 --> 1:33:17.460
 Certainly is.

1:33:17.460 --> 1:33:18.900
 That's why I showed him Strangelove,

1:33:18.900 --> 1:33:20.700
 because I wanted him to show him.

1:33:20.700 --> 1:33:22.900
 I wanted Mr. Putin to say, look at this film.

1:33:22.900 --> 1:33:23.720
 You never saw it.

1:33:23.720 --> 1:33:24.860
 How can you not say, you know,

1:33:24.860 --> 1:33:27.740
 it's a seminal film in American history

1:33:27.740 --> 1:33:28.940
 to those people who care.

1:33:28.940 --> 1:33:33.940
 And it shows you the Kubrick had a pacifist, thank God,

1:33:34.100 --> 1:33:39.100
 antiwar mentality, which he showed in Bows of Glory

1:33:39.560 --> 1:33:40.840
 as well as Strangelove.

1:33:42.300 --> 1:33:46.180
 And it's such a dire, well done scenario

1:33:46.180 --> 1:33:48.700
 that I wanted Mr. Putin to be aware

1:33:48.700 --> 1:33:50.500
 of the way the United States thinks.

1:33:51.360 --> 1:33:53.940
 Yeah, the absurdity of escalation,

1:33:53.940 --> 1:33:56.500
 the absurdity of war at the largest scale,

1:33:56.500 --> 1:33:59.420
 the absurdity of nuclear war, especially.

1:33:59.420 --> 1:34:02.060
 Can we walk back from the brink of nuclear war?

1:34:03.740 --> 1:34:04.580
 Can we?

1:34:04.580 --> 1:34:05.400
 Can we?

1:34:05.400 --> 1:34:06.240
 Yes, yes we can.

1:34:06.240 --> 1:34:07.740
 What's the path to walk back?

1:34:07.740 --> 1:34:08.580
 Reason.

1:34:08.580 --> 1:34:09.420
 Reason.

1:34:09.420 --> 1:34:10.240
 Between who and whom?

1:34:10.240 --> 1:34:11.380
 Reason and diplomacy.

1:34:11.380 --> 1:34:12.420
 There's no reason.

1:34:12.420 --> 1:34:15.180
 I mean, talk to the guy.

1:34:15.180 --> 1:34:17.860
 Mr. Biden, why don't you calm down

1:34:17.860 --> 1:34:20.860
 and go and talk to Mr. Putin in Moscow?

1:34:20.860 --> 1:34:23.020
 Why don't you just sit across the table from him

1:34:23.020 --> 1:34:26.060
 and try to have a discussion without falling

1:34:26.060 --> 1:34:28.440
 into ideologies and stuff like that?

1:34:29.540 --> 1:34:31.180
 Can I ask you for advice?

1:34:31.180 --> 1:34:34.740
 You did some of the most difficult interviews ever.

1:34:34.740 --> 1:34:38.460
 Do you have advice that you can give to someone like me

1:34:38.460 --> 1:34:40.540
 or anyone hoping to understand something

1:34:40.540 --> 1:34:44.780
 about a human being sitting across from them

1:34:44.780 --> 1:34:47.860
 about what it takes to do a good interview?

1:34:47.860 --> 1:34:48.760
 You're doing one.

1:34:48.760 --> 1:34:52.720
 Well, no, but there's a, listen,

1:34:52.720 --> 1:34:55.080
 there's levels to this game.

1:34:55.080 --> 1:34:58.080
 And interviewing somebody like Vladimir Putin,

1:34:58.080 --> 1:35:03.080
 also language barrier, sit across from the man,

1:35:03.160 --> 1:35:04.920
 try to keep an open mind,

1:35:06.120 --> 1:35:08.840
 try to also ask challenging questions,

1:35:08.840 --> 1:35:11.040
 but not challenging with an agenda,

1:35:11.040 --> 1:35:14.340
 but seeking to understand and understand deeply.

1:35:14.340 --> 1:35:15.920
 How do you do that?

1:35:15.920 --> 1:35:17.200
 Seeking the truth.

1:35:17.200 --> 1:35:18.080
 It's very simple.

1:35:18.080 --> 1:35:20.960
 Seeking the truth, being a questioner like you are.

1:35:20.960 --> 1:35:23.400
 You wanna know what is really going on.

1:35:23.400 --> 1:35:26.960
 I could not get anywhere with Biden or Bush

1:35:26.960 --> 1:35:28.400
 or for that matter, Obama.

1:35:28.400 --> 1:35:30.080
 They'd be opaque with me.

1:35:30.080 --> 1:35:31.360
 There's no interview possible

1:35:31.360 --> 1:35:32.640
 with the president of the United States

1:35:32.640 --> 1:35:34.920
 because he's got to stand for all the stuff

1:35:34.920 --> 1:35:37.640
 that they stand for, which is imperialism,

1:35:37.640 --> 1:35:39.160
 which is control of the world.

1:35:39.160 --> 1:35:41.360
 How can you defend that?

1:35:41.360 --> 1:35:42.560
 No one's gonna come out and say that.

1:35:42.560 --> 1:35:44.720
 They're always gonna blame the enemy.

1:35:44.720 --> 1:35:45.760
 They're gonna blame Iran.

1:35:45.760 --> 1:35:47.920
 They're gonna blame China.

1:35:47.920 --> 1:35:50.040
 So with some people, it may not be possible

1:35:50.040 --> 1:35:51.360
 to break through the opaqueness.

1:35:51.360 --> 1:35:52.200
 You can't, you can't.

1:35:52.200 --> 1:35:54.280
 I mean, have you ever seen an interview with the president

1:35:54.280 --> 1:35:56.040
 besides being personable,

1:35:57.480 --> 1:36:00.200
 where he actually discussed American policy?

1:36:00.200 --> 1:36:03.600
 Yeah, I mean, not really, but maybe after their president.

1:36:03.600 --> 1:36:06.880
 I could see Obama being able to do such an interview.

1:36:06.880 --> 1:36:10.220
 I could see George W. being able to do such an interview.

1:36:10.220 --> 1:36:13.360
 Or are they not able to reflect at all on the?

1:36:13.360 --> 1:36:15.200
 George W. hasn't shown much conscience

1:36:15.200 --> 1:36:17.680
 in terms of thinking about what he's done.

1:36:17.680 --> 1:36:18.640
 You've seen that.

1:36:18.640 --> 1:36:20.520
 You ever see my movie, W.?

1:36:20.520 --> 1:36:22.240
 I think that's one of my best movies

1:36:22.240 --> 1:36:25.400
 because it shows a man who's just out of his depth

1:36:25.400 --> 1:36:28.320
 and has no, he has a conscience at the end of the movie.

1:36:28.320 --> 1:36:31.080
 If you remember correctly, he talks to his wife

1:36:31.080 --> 1:36:33.200
 and he says, I don't get it.

1:36:33.200 --> 1:36:34.480
 I'm trying to do good in the world.

1:36:34.480 --> 1:36:36.880
 I've done, I believe in good and right.

1:36:36.880 --> 1:36:40.920
 And why do people not understand that kind of complaint

1:36:40.920 --> 1:36:42.660
 as if he can't get outside himself

1:36:42.660 --> 1:36:45.040
 to understand the way other people think?

1:36:45.040 --> 1:36:47.800
 Empathies, walking like a dramatist is what I do.

1:36:47.800 --> 1:36:50.720
 You walk in the footsteps of other people.

1:36:50.720 --> 1:36:52.440
 When I did a movie about Richard Nixon,

1:36:52.440 --> 1:36:54.080
 it wasn't because I liked him.

1:36:54.080 --> 1:36:55.820
 It was because I wanted to,

1:36:55.820 --> 1:36:57.960
 I think I understood a part of him because of my father

1:36:57.960 --> 1:37:00.680
 and I think I wanted to walk in his footsteps.

1:37:00.680 --> 1:37:03.160
 That's not to say I sympathize with him because I didn't.

1:37:03.160 --> 1:37:05.920
 I don't think he helped the American cause at all,

1:37:05.920 --> 1:37:08.920
 but it was empathize as opposed to sympathize.

1:37:08.920 --> 1:37:10.080
 Same thing with Bush.

1:37:10.080 --> 1:37:11.720
 People were shocked when I did the Bush movie.

1:37:11.720 --> 1:37:16.720
 They said, how can you be in any way receptive to this guy?

1:37:18.360 --> 1:37:19.720
 That's wrong.

1:37:19.720 --> 1:37:22.120
 Dramatists don't have political positions.

1:37:22.120 --> 1:37:23.940
 They walk in the shoes of.

1:37:23.940 --> 1:37:27.160
 That's why Bush movie perhaps was surprising

1:37:27.160 --> 1:37:29.380
 and many people didn't care for it.

1:37:29.380 --> 1:37:34.380
 Maybe that's what, but that's, you've got to go there.

1:37:34.840 --> 1:37:38.080
 If you did a movie about a villain, you have to go there.

1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:41.000
 You have to walk in their shoes.

1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:41.840
 Yes.

1:37:41.840 --> 1:37:43.640
 So see them, cause they usually,

1:37:43.640 --> 1:37:46.640
 villains usually see themselves as the hero.

1:37:46.640 --> 1:37:47.560
 Yes.

1:37:47.560 --> 1:37:51.160
 So you have to consider what is it like to live in a world

1:37:51.160 --> 1:37:53.880
 where this person is the hero?

1:37:53.880 --> 1:37:54.720
 Yes.

1:37:55.680 --> 1:37:56.980
 Is that a burden?

1:37:56.980 --> 1:37:57.820
 Is that hard?

1:37:57.820 --> 1:37:59.480
 Not for George W. Bush.

1:37:59.480 --> 1:38:02.600
 He's bitching because they didn't understand him,

1:38:02.600 --> 1:38:05.140
 but he had a good vision he said of democracy

1:38:05.140 --> 1:38:09.720
 and you know, democracy forgives a lot of sins.

1:38:09.720 --> 1:38:11.780
 Can I ask you a hard question on that?

1:38:11.780 --> 1:38:13.280
 Yes, sure.

1:38:13.280 --> 1:38:16.860
 So because empathy is so important to a great interview,

1:38:16.860 --> 1:38:19.400
 let's ask the most challenging version of empathy,

1:38:19.400 --> 1:38:23.080
 which is when you're sitting across from a man

1:38:23.080 --> 1:38:26.840
 on the brink of war that leads to tens of millions

1:38:26.840 --> 1:38:28.620
 of deaths, which is Hitler.

1:38:28.620 --> 1:38:31.280
 So if you could interview Hitler in 1939,

1:38:32.200 --> 1:38:36.780
 as the drums of war start to beat or 1941

1:38:36.780 --> 1:38:39.840
 when they're already full on war, but there's still

1:38:39.840 --> 1:38:44.100
 a lot of pacifists, there's still a lot of people unsure

1:38:44.100 --> 1:38:48.320
 what are the motivations behind what Hitler's doing.

1:38:48.320 --> 1:38:49.640
 How would you do that interview?

1:38:49.640 --> 1:38:50.760
 Well it depends when you do it.

1:38:50.760 --> 1:38:54.480
 If you do it in 38, I certainly would have,

1:38:54.480 --> 1:38:57.120
 no you have to, if you sit down across from Hitler,

1:38:57.120 --> 1:38:57.960
 you empathize.

1:38:57.960 --> 1:38:59.040
 What is your beef?

1:38:59.040 --> 1:39:00.680
 Where have you been?

1:39:00.680 --> 1:39:02.200
 What is your consciousness?

1:39:02.200 --> 1:39:05.200
 Why do you hate Jewish people?

1:39:05.200 --> 1:39:10.200
 Why, what is, all these questions that come up.

1:39:10.840 --> 1:39:13.880
 His sense of grievance as a result of World War I.

1:39:13.880 --> 1:39:16.380
 There's justifications there, et cetera.

1:39:16.380 --> 1:39:19.120
 But if I, and by the way, Churchill was trying

1:39:19.120 --> 1:39:21.120
 to make a deal with him in 38.

1:39:21.120 --> 1:39:23.040
 That's a fact that people don't know.

1:39:23.040 --> 1:39:25.780
 Churchill himself, there was still the desire

1:39:25.780 --> 1:39:28.180
 in England to make peace with Germany.

1:39:29.880 --> 1:39:34.440
 And it was seen as a possible, what Churchill

1:39:34.440 --> 1:39:36.900
 really wanted was Hitler to go against Russia.

1:39:36.900 --> 1:39:40.080
 And anything to destroy the Bolsheviks.

1:39:40.080 --> 1:39:42.760
 So he was using Hitler as much as he could

1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:46.760
 to go after Russia, but Hitler was too elusive

1:39:46.760 --> 1:39:48.640
 to get, to pin him down.

1:39:48.640 --> 1:39:51.640
 But if you remember, Hitler was very kind at the end of,

1:39:51.640 --> 1:39:53.600
 kind is not the right word, was,

1:39:54.960 --> 1:39:58.560
 did not go after the British Empire when he had France.

1:39:58.560 --> 1:39:59.560
 And he could have.

1:40:00.740 --> 1:40:04.300
 He had another objective, which was obviously the East.

1:40:04.300 --> 1:40:08.880
 So Hitler's goal, I think, he always had an admiration

1:40:08.880 --> 1:40:09.720
 for England.

1:40:09.720 --> 1:40:11.740
 It's an interesting story, always.

1:40:13.040 --> 1:40:15.320
 And the empire.

1:40:15.320 --> 1:40:19.320
 Yes, and certainly Churchill, we have no doubts now

1:40:19.320 --> 1:40:22.560
 from history revisionism that Churchill's interest,

1:40:22.560 --> 1:40:24.560
 main interest, was not Germany.

1:40:24.560 --> 1:40:26.160
 It was the British Empire.

1:40:26.160 --> 1:40:28.480
 And to preserve it to India, the road to India

1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:31.240
 and all that, and Middle East.

1:40:31.240 --> 1:40:34.360
 Churchill fought the entire war with the concept

1:40:34.360 --> 1:40:36.160
 of preserving the British Empire.

1:40:36.160 --> 1:40:39.920
 All his goals, he sent America on a goose chase into Italy,

1:40:39.920 --> 1:40:41.840
 you could argue, instead of establishing

1:40:41.840 --> 1:40:44.440
 a sincere second front in Western Europe.

1:40:47.680 --> 1:40:49.120
 Interesting man.

1:40:49.120 --> 1:40:50.480
 So I would have tried to get, you know,

1:40:50.480 --> 1:40:52.660
 I think I would have approached it the same way.

1:40:52.660 --> 1:40:55.080
 In 1939, it would have been a different story

1:40:55.080 --> 1:40:58.080
 because at that point, he'd attacked Poland,

1:40:58.080 --> 1:41:00.420
 and in 1940, France.

1:41:00.420 --> 1:41:02.440
 So it's another ball game.

1:41:02.440 --> 1:41:05.320
 But certainly, at whatever point you talk to him,

1:41:05.320 --> 1:41:07.660
 I would try to understand his point.

1:41:07.660 --> 1:41:09.200
 I'm not judging you, Hitler.

1:41:09.200 --> 1:41:11.360
 I'm saying to you, tell me what you're thinking.

1:41:11.360 --> 1:41:12.560
 Why are you invading Russia?

1:41:12.560 --> 1:41:13.800
 What's your thought?

1:41:13.800 --> 1:41:15.160
 That's all an interviewer should do.

1:41:15.160 --> 1:41:18.080
 He shouldn't be expressing his contempt for Hitler,

1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:21.420
 which like an American journalist interviewing Putin,

1:41:21.420 --> 1:41:25.480
 I'm getting brownie points for expressing my contempt for you.

1:41:26.880 --> 1:41:27.880
 That doesn't wash with me.

1:41:27.880 --> 1:41:29.160
 That's ugly.

1:41:29.160 --> 1:41:30.280
 Seek to understand.

1:41:30.280 --> 1:41:31.120
 Yes.

1:41:32.280 --> 1:41:33.760
 This is a technical question,

1:41:33.760 --> 1:41:36.840
 but was language a barrier as an interviewer?

1:41:36.840 --> 1:41:37.780
 To some degree.

1:41:37.780 --> 1:41:40.160
 It's very hard to learn Russian.

1:41:40.160 --> 1:41:42.520
 But I had very, they have excellent translators

1:41:42.520 --> 1:41:43.880
 in the Kremlin, excellent.

1:41:43.880 --> 1:41:47.560
 They are people who are trained very seriously

1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:50.460
 for months or years before they,

1:41:50.460 --> 1:41:53.720
 these people are young and they're very bright.

1:41:53.720 --> 1:41:55.520
 I was very impressed with the Russian translators.

1:41:55.520 --> 1:41:56.360
 It's interesting.

1:41:56.360 --> 1:41:58.260
 I mean, I'm impressed as well,

1:41:58.260 --> 1:42:00.560
 but there's a humor that's lost.

1:42:01.760 --> 1:42:03.680
 There's a wit, a dry wit.

1:42:03.680 --> 1:42:05.860
 There's stuff said between the lines.

1:42:06.880 --> 1:42:09.380
 That's not actually how much content,

1:42:09.380 --> 1:42:12.720
 but it's more kind of the things

1:42:12.720 --> 1:42:15.360
 that make communication more frictionless.

1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:20.360
 It's the, there's a kind of sadness to a Russian humor

1:42:20.920 --> 1:42:22.720
 that permeates all things.

1:42:22.720 --> 1:42:24.840
 And that sometimes is lost in translation.

1:42:24.840 --> 1:42:26.960
 The translation is a little bit colder,

1:42:26.960 --> 1:42:29.880
 meaning it just conveys the facts.

1:42:29.880 --> 1:42:31.720
 Would you call it sardonic humor?

1:42:31.720 --> 1:42:33.440
 I would say so, yeah.

1:42:33.440 --> 1:42:34.320
 And so it's interesting.

1:42:34.320 --> 1:42:36.440
 But I think you could see that from facial expressions

1:42:36.440 --> 1:42:38.160
 when you're sitting across from the person

1:42:38.160 --> 1:42:39.000
 and you can feel it.

1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:39.820
 I feel it, yeah.

1:42:39.820 --> 1:42:41.280
 You can feel it.

1:42:41.280 --> 1:42:42.920
 Let me ask you in general,

1:42:43.840 --> 1:42:48.500
 what's the role of love in the human condition,

1:42:48.500 --> 1:42:50.760
 in your life, in life in general?

1:42:50.760 --> 1:42:53.720
 You've talked, you looked at some of the darkest aspect

1:42:53.720 --> 1:42:55.600
 of human nature.

1:42:55.600 --> 1:42:57.160
 What's the role of this,

1:42:57.160 --> 1:42:59.520
 one of the more beautiful aspects of human nature?

1:42:59.520 --> 1:43:01.040
 I think without love, I wouldn't,

1:43:01.040 --> 1:43:02.920
 I don't think I'd be able to carry on.

1:43:02.920 --> 1:43:06.920
 I think that love is my, love is the greatest,

1:43:08.520 --> 1:43:11.120
 the ability to love is the greatest virtue you can have.

1:43:11.120 --> 1:43:14.960
 It's the ability to share with another,

1:43:14.960 --> 1:43:17.680
 with your family, with your children, with your wife,

1:43:17.680 --> 1:43:19.440
 with your lover, your partner.

1:43:19.440 --> 1:43:22.360
 It's an ability to extend yourself into the world

1:43:22.360 --> 1:43:23.860
 and it brings empathy with it.

1:43:23.860 --> 1:43:25.840
 If you love well,

1:43:25.840 --> 1:43:28.400
 I think you expand it to the human race too.

1:43:28.400 --> 1:43:32.440
 And it's the strength behind the great novelists,

1:43:32.440 --> 1:43:34.600
 the great artists of our time.

1:43:35.640 --> 1:43:40.640
 I think part of the reason I suppose

1:43:41.300 --> 1:43:42.800
 we're scared of science sometimes

1:43:42.800 --> 1:43:44.320
 is because the scientists sometimes

1:43:44.320 --> 1:43:45.640
 don't express that clearly.

1:43:45.640 --> 1:43:49.480
 You can lose that when you focus on the facts,

1:43:49.480 --> 1:43:54.480
 on empirical data, on the science of things.

1:43:54.480 --> 1:43:58.320
 You can lose the humanity that's between the lines.

1:43:58.320 --> 1:44:00.720
 I'm often struck by when I talk to scientists

1:44:00.720 --> 1:44:02.040
 and I've talked to a few,

1:44:02.040 --> 1:44:03.920
 that how arrogant they can be about,

1:44:03.920 --> 1:44:06.960
 they don't talk to you if you don't understand their world

1:44:06.960 --> 1:44:09.120
 and they talk to each other and there's an arrogance,

1:44:09.120 --> 1:44:10.620
 a closed circle kind of thing.

1:44:10.620 --> 1:44:12.520
 Oh, he's not at my level, I can't,

1:44:12.520 --> 1:44:14.580
 there's no discussion to be had with this person,

1:44:14.580 --> 1:44:16.200
 he's a human being.

1:44:16.200 --> 1:44:18.080
 That arrogance is terrifying to me

1:44:18.080 --> 1:44:23.040
 because it's next door neighbor to closed mindedness

1:44:23.040 --> 1:44:25.440
 which then can be used by charismatic leaders

1:44:25.440 --> 1:44:27.440
 as it was in Nazi Germany

1:44:27.440 --> 1:44:29.740
 to commit some of the worst atrocities.

1:44:29.740 --> 1:44:34.040
 The scientists can be used as pawns

1:44:34.040 --> 1:44:36.800
 in a very cruel game.

1:44:37.800 --> 1:44:39.560
 What advice would you give to young people?

1:44:39.560 --> 1:44:43.720
 You've done, first of all, some of the greatest films ever.

1:44:43.720 --> 1:44:47.920
 You've lived a heck of a life.

1:44:47.920 --> 1:44:51.180
 You've, were fearless and bold

1:44:51.180 --> 1:44:53.960
 in asking some really difficult questions of this world.

1:44:53.960 --> 1:44:56.280
 What advice would you give to young people today,

1:44:56.280 --> 1:44:59.760
 high school, college, about career?

1:45:00.920 --> 1:45:02.800
 How to have a career they can be proud of

1:45:02.800 --> 1:45:05.000
 or how to have a life they can be proud of?

1:45:06.640 --> 1:45:07.840
 Well, I have three children

1:45:07.840 --> 1:45:11.920
 so obviously I'm not necessarily the best advisor

1:45:11.920 --> 1:45:15.640
 in the world and I do find that the children,

1:45:15.640 --> 1:45:17.460
 I've raised them with a sense of freedom

1:45:17.460 --> 1:45:19.280
 and they do what they want.

1:45:19.280 --> 1:45:22.800
 In the end, it's their life, their destiny, their character.

1:45:22.800 --> 1:45:24.520
 That's what comes out.

1:45:24.520 --> 1:45:27.040
 You can try to influence it

1:45:27.040 --> 1:45:30.360
 but you can try to get your daughter to wake up

1:45:30.360 --> 1:45:32.800
 at a certain hour in the day but it never works.

1:45:34.160 --> 1:45:37.240
 So I long ago gave up on that

1:45:38.200 --> 1:45:40.200
 and my children are all grown now

1:45:40.200 --> 1:45:44.500
 but aside from that, I think if I was a teacher in a school

1:45:44.500 --> 1:45:48.720
 and teaching film, I'd say to the students,

1:45:48.720 --> 1:45:49.920
 get an education.

1:45:49.920 --> 1:45:53.640
 You can't just look at film because it's not

1:45:53.640 --> 1:45:55.900
 a full education, it's not the spectrum.

1:45:55.900 --> 1:45:58.000
 I don't think you should teach film as a,

1:45:59.240 --> 1:46:02.760
 I think you need a base in other worlds.

1:46:02.760 --> 1:46:05.840
 One of the greatest courses I took at NYU was,

1:46:05.840 --> 1:46:08.520
 and I was a war veteran on the GI Bill

1:46:08.520 --> 1:46:10.300
 so I was older than the other students.

1:46:10.300 --> 1:46:13.520
 One of the great, I took a class outside the film school

1:46:13.520 --> 1:46:18.160
 in Greek classics because I hadn't had much history

1:46:18.160 --> 1:46:20.680
 and I wanted to know more about the world of Homer

1:46:20.680 --> 1:46:23.600
 and so forth and the teacher opened my eyes

1:46:23.600 --> 1:46:26.380
 to so much in that class and I wrote about it

1:46:26.380 --> 1:46:29.600
 in my memoir, it's called Chasing the Light

1:46:29.600 --> 1:46:33.080
 about Professor Leahy and what he did to me.

1:46:33.080 --> 1:46:36.600
 He gave me the concepts clearly of consciousness

1:46:36.600 --> 1:46:39.560
 which is the Homeric theme of Odysseus

1:46:39.560 --> 1:46:44.560
 and also lethe, L E T H E, which is sleep

1:46:47.240 --> 1:46:52.240
 and how most of the crew, Odysseus's crew,

1:46:53.240 --> 1:46:56.200
 were experiencing lethe and how necessary it was

1:46:56.200 --> 1:46:57.480
 to stay awake.

1:46:58.360 --> 1:47:01.880
 So it's not just film, it's just you have to learn

1:47:01.880 --> 1:47:04.460
 the world as much as you can when you're young

1:47:04.460 --> 1:47:09.460
 and so that I think is the basis of a good education

1:47:10.040 --> 1:47:15.040
 and a classic one is important, a basis.

1:47:15.440 --> 1:47:18.120
 I think then you go on and you can learn computer

1:47:18.120 --> 1:47:20.640
 if you want but that's specialization.

1:47:21.900 --> 1:47:24.600
 If you're a computer geek, is that a life?

1:47:24.600 --> 1:47:26.380
 Does that give you enough satisfaction?

1:47:26.380 --> 1:47:29.860
 Do you get the joy out of people?

1:47:29.860 --> 1:47:32.120
 No, just like filmmaking is a skill.

1:47:32.120 --> 1:47:32.960
 Yes, right.

1:47:32.960 --> 1:47:36.640
 You have the broad background to understand the world,

1:47:36.640 --> 1:47:40.360
 literature, history.

1:47:40.360 --> 1:47:41.200
 Absolutely.

1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:47.700
 So one of the things about being human is life is finite.

1:47:48.520 --> 1:47:50.000
 It ends.

1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:52.200
 Do you think about your death?

1:47:52.200 --> 1:47:53.240
 Are you afraid of your death?

1:47:53.240 --> 1:47:54.320
 Yeah, sure.

1:47:54.320 --> 1:47:56.640
 Absolutely, you have to come to terms with death

1:47:56.640 --> 1:47:58.640
 and that's a tough one for many people.

1:47:58.640 --> 1:47:59.480
 It's always there.

1:47:59.480 --> 1:48:01.320
 I'm older than you, obviously,

1:48:01.320 --> 1:48:02.960
 and I'm getting closer to it.

1:48:02.960 --> 1:48:04.820
 Couldn't happen any day, actually.

1:48:04.820 --> 1:48:06.260
 When you get to a certain age,

1:48:06.260 --> 1:48:08.480
 you can't assume that you're gonna be alive tomorrow.

1:48:08.480 --> 1:48:10.360
 So I try to deal with that.

1:48:10.360 --> 1:48:12.320
 Are you afraid of it?

1:48:12.320 --> 1:48:15.520
 Much less so than I was when I was younger.

1:48:15.520 --> 1:48:16.760
 Remember, I was in Vietnam

1:48:16.760 --> 1:48:18.320
 but I thought I dealt with it there

1:48:18.320 --> 1:48:21.800
 but when I came back, I realized that I wanted to live.

1:48:21.800 --> 1:48:24.600
 So yes, I've learned over time

1:48:24.600 --> 1:48:27.940
 to get more and more used to it and get ready for it.

1:48:27.940 --> 1:48:31.000
 What's a good answer to the question of why live?

1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:33.480
 So the realization that you wanted to live.

1:48:34.600 --> 1:48:36.580
 What was the reason to live?

1:48:36.580 --> 1:48:38.720
 Because it was better than being one of those corpses

1:48:38.720 --> 1:48:40.760
 that I saw in the jungle.

1:48:40.760 --> 1:48:43.280
 I saw how finite death is.

1:48:45.320 --> 1:48:48.080
 Are there things in your life you regret?

1:48:48.080 --> 1:48:48.920
 Oh, sure.

1:48:48.920 --> 1:48:49.760
 Too many.

1:48:55.640 --> 1:48:58.020
 Is there something you wish you could have done differently?

1:48:58.020 --> 1:49:00.600
 Like if you could go back to do one thing differently

1:49:00.600 --> 1:49:01.820
 or that it regrets all of it.

1:49:01.820 --> 1:49:02.660
 Did you ask Musk this?

1:49:02.660 --> 1:49:04.040
 I'm curious.

1:49:04.040 --> 1:49:04.880
 What did he say?

1:49:04.880 --> 1:49:07.220
 Offline all the time.

1:49:09.600 --> 1:49:11.520
 No, no.

1:49:11.520 --> 1:49:12.680
 You'd be curious to know.

1:49:12.680 --> 1:49:13.960
 And he's an engineer too

1:49:13.960 --> 1:49:17.360
 and engineers really value mistakes.

1:49:17.360 --> 1:49:18.200
 Engineers value mistakes.

1:49:18.200 --> 1:49:19.600
 Value mistakes and errors

1:49:19.600 --> 1:49:22.400
 because that's an opportunity to learn.

1:49:22.400 --> 1:49:24.120
 I mean, this is what you do with systems

1:49:24.120 --> 1:49:26.520
 is you test them, then test them, then test them

1:49:26.520 --> 1:49:28.560
 and errors is just information.

1:49:28.560 --> 1:49:29.400
 He did that with the rockets.

1:49:29.400 --> 1:49:31.240
 That is true in its way of filmmaking.

1:49:31.240 --> 1:49:35.240
 There are certain things you learn as you build films

1:49:35.240 --> 1:49:36.720
 and you make mistakes.

1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:39.600
 It's like putting an engine together and you,

1:49:39.600 --> 1:49:42.260
 oh, the film is flawed in that way, you know it.

1:49:42.260 --> 1:49:43.880
 Other people may or may not see it,

1:49:43.880 --> 1:49:48.260
 but the car runs or it made money or it didn't make money.

1:49:48.260 --> 1:49:49.900
 It can be good and it didn't make money,

1:49:49.900 --> 1:49:53.120
 but the point is that everything is a build.

1:49:53.120 --> 1:49:54.800
 Every film is a construction.

1:49:54.800 --> 1:49:57.540
 Same thing as he goes through on a Tesla,

1:49:57.540 --> 1:49:59.480
 we go through on each film.

1:49:59.480 --> 1:50:03.100
 But films are art.

1:50:03.100 --> 1:50:03.940
 It's a little tricky.

1:50:03.940 --> 1:50:05.760
 Yeah, the thing is one film does not lead

1:50:05.760 --> 1:50:09.820
 to a lifetime guarantee of copyright.

1:50:11.580 --> 1:50:16.580
 Well, yeah, you have the movie game as you've called it.

1:50:17.120 --> 1:50:17.960
 Yeah.

1:50:17.960 --> 1:50:22.640
 It's a complicated and cruel game.

1:50:22.640 --> 1:50:24.920
 But it takes enormous amount of work,

1:50:24.920 --> 1:50:26.520
 enormous amount of work to make a film.

1:50:26.520 --> 1:50:28.800
 People underestimate that.

1:50:28.800 --> 1:50:33.600
 It's extremely complicated to have something be successful

1:50:34.900 --> 1:50:38.200
 because it has so many elements of luck involved

1:50:38.200 --> 1:50:42.000
 and reception and so forth.

1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:46.280
 What do you think, I apologize for the absurd question,

1:50:46.280 --> 1:50:48.520
 but what do you think is the meaning of life?

1:50:48.520 --> 1:50:50.280
 Why are we here?

1:50:50.280 --> 1:50:51.100
 The why.

1:50:51.100 --> 1:50:52.320
 I think to realize ourselves,

1:50:52.320 --> 1:50:54.700
 to realize more of what you are,

1:50:54.700 --> 1:50:57.700
 to realize what life is, to appreciate it,

1:50:57.700 --> 1:51:01.040
 to grow, to honor our life,

1:51:01.040 --> 1:51:02.580
 to honor the concept of life

1:51:02.580 --> 1:51:04.600
 and to understand how precious life is.

1:51:06.180 --> 1:51:08.880
 The preciousness of life, as the Buddhists say.

1:51:08.880 --> 1:51:12.360
 And of course, the immediacy of death all around us.

1:51:12.360 --> 1:51:14.820
 The causes of death are all around us.

1:51:15.880 --> 1:51:18.600
 And our life is like, as they say,

1:51:18.600 --> 1:51:23.600
 is like a lantern in a strong breeze existing

1:51:23.600 --> 1:51:25.600
 among the causes of death.

1:51:25.600 --> 1:51:27.520
 So life is so precious.

1:51:27.520 --> 1:51:31.080
 And at the same time, the immediacy of death

1:51:31.080 --> 1:51:33.160
 and then of course, the continuation of life

1:51:33.160 --> 1:51:35.020
 in whatever form it's gonna take.

1:51:36.280 --> 1:51:40.200
 But in this life, to wake up to the preciousness of it.

1:51:40.200 --> 1:51:41.080
 To the preciousness.

1:51:41.080 --> 1:51:42.480
 Yeah, that's a wonderful thing, by the way.

1:51:42.480 --> 1:51:43.800
 I didn't have that when I was young.

1:51:43.800 --> 1:51:44.900
 I took it for granted.

1:51:47.280 --> 1:51:49.840
 Oliver, like I said, I'm a huge fan.

1:51:49.840 --> 1:51:51.760
 You're an incredible human being,

1:51:51.760 --> 1:51:53.900
 one of the greatest artists ever.

1:51:54.760 --> 1:51:57.320
 So it's a huge honor that you sit with me

1:51:57.320 --> 1:52:00.720
 and talk so deeply and honestly

1:52:00.720 --> 1:52:02.480
 about some very difficult topics.

1:52:02.480 --> 1:52:05.180
 Again, you're an inspiration and it's an honor

1:52:05.180 --> 1:52:06.840
 that you will spend your valuable time with me.

1:52:06.840 --> 1:52:07.680
 Thank you very much.

1:52:07.680 --> 1:52:08.520
 Thanks for talking to me.

1:52:08.520 --> 1:52:10.000
 Fun being here.

1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:12.640
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Oliver Stone.

1:52:12.640 --> 1:52:13.920

 And now, let me leave you with some words

1:52:18.360 --> 1:52:20.560
 from Oliver Stone in the untold history

1:52:20.560 --> 1:52:22.560
 of the United States.

1:52:22.560 --> 1:52:24.720
 To fail is not tragic.

1:52:24.720 --> 1:52:26.440
 To be human is.

1:52:26.440 --> 1:52:53.440
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
