WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.360
 It wasn't just a one on one.

00:01.360 --> 00:03.480
 It could be Steve against the team going,

00:03.480 --> 00:05.800
 we need glass instead of plastic

00:05.800 --> 00:07.600
 on the front face of the iPhone.

00:07.600 --> 00:10.000
 And we're going to do this.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
 And we're like, God, you know, and so we did it.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
 And he pushed us because he didn't know all the details,

00:17.000 --> 00:19.480
 but he could see in our minds that we're like,

00:19.480 --> 00:22.040
 yeah, we could probably, yeah, we could probably,

00:22.040 --> 00:24.080
 but man, it's really putting us in risk.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.040
 And we laid out the risks for him.

00:26.040 --> 00:28.280
 And he's like, I'm willing to take those risks.

00:28.280 --> 00:31.200
 The following is a conversation with Tony Fadell,

00:31.200 --> 00:34.920
 engineer and designer, co creator of the iPod,

00:34.920 --> 00:38.400
 the iPhone and the Nest Thermostat.

00:38.400 --> 00:41.080
 And he's the author of the new book, Build,

00:41.080 --> 00:45.200
 an unorthodox guide to making things worth making.

00:45.200 --> 00:48.080
 More than almost any human ever,

00:48.080 --> 00:50.880
 he knows what it takes to create technology ideas,

00:50.880 --> 00:55.160
 designs, products and companies that revolutionize life

00:55.160 --> 00:58.360
 for huge numbers of people in the world.

00:58.360 --> 01:01.120
 So it truly is an honor and pleasure

01:01.120 --> 01:02.960
 to sit down with Tony for a time

01:02.960 --> 01:05.720
 and look back at one heck of an amazing life.

01:06.640 --> 01:08.720
 This is the Lex Readman podcast.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.960
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:10.960 --> 01:12.200
 in the description.

01:12.200 --> 01:16.200
 And now, dear friends, here's Tony Fadell.

01:17.320 --> 01:20.480
 When did you first fall in love with computers?

01:20.480 --> 01:22.800
 Or let's say computer engineering and design?

01:22.800 --> 01:27.800
 I first fell in love with computers and programming.

01:28.880 --> 01:33.880
 Was it a summer school class in fifth grade

01:33.880 --> 01:36.000
 in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan?

01:37.520 --> 01:39.960
 It was a simple basic programming class,

01:39.960 --> 01:41.520
 but the basic programming class

01:41.520 --> 01:44.080
 was not like you might think it was.

01:44.080 --> 01:45.480
 It was bubble cards.

01:45.480 --> 01:50.280
 So literally it was the cards, the stack of cards,

01:50.280 --> 01:53.840
 and you would use a number two pencil and you would put in

01:53.840 --> 01:55.320
 your program line by line,

01:55.320 --> 01:57.280
 and you'd have to make sure it was perfectly stacked

01:57.280 --> 01:58.760
 and no errors and what have you.

01:58.760 --> 02:00.320
 And you would take that set of cards

02:00.320 --> 02:03.280
 and you'd put it on this reader and it would zzzt, zzzt, zzzt.

02:03.280 --> 02:06.080
 And it would go off to an IBM microcomputer

02:06.080 --> 02:09.080
 somewhere in the, back then the cloud.

02:09.080 --> 02:14.080
 And then you would sit on a Texas Instruments paper terminal.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.200
 And it would just, literally I was just,

02:19.200 --> 02:21.160
 I could write things and it would,

02:21.160 --> 02:23.000
 I could program this machine to do stuff.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.200
 And it was, you know, it was nowhere near sexy.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.880
 There was no graphics, right?

02:26.880 --> 02:30.440
 Oregon Trail was all in text, right?

02:30.440 --> 02:33.360
 The cards were so cumbersome that if you got one thing wrong

02:33.360 --> 02:37.240
 or out of order, or a disaster, or you dropped one card,

02:37.240 --> 02:38.800
 it would all fall apart.

02:38.800 --> 02:42.520
 So just doing that, you know, print f,

02:42.520 --> 02:43.360
 or what was it?

02:43.360 --> 02:44.760
 I can only remember what it was.

02:44.760 --> 02:48.240
 It was, you know, what the basic commands were, but.

02:48.240 --> 02:50.680
 Oh, so when you say basic, you mean basic programming?

02:50.680 --> 02:51.680
 Programming language.

02:51.680 --> 02:52.520
 Okay.

02:52.520 --> 02:53.360
 Basic programming.

02:53.360 --> 02:57.440
 So you're writing basic programming language on paper.

02:57.440 --> 02:58.520
 On paper.

02:58.520 --> 03:00.040
 And you're calling it programming though.

03:00.040 --> 03:01.160
 It's called programming.

03:01.160 --> 03:03.600
 Yeah, you're programming this computer in, you know,

03:03.600 --> 03:06.200
 in a remote location and it came back.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.640
 So it was truly cloud computing in a way.

03:08.640 --> 03:11.280
 So it was really terminal based computing.

03:11.280 --> 03:14.040
 And the input and the program are separate.

03:14.040 --> 03:17.200
 So the input to the program, or they could go together.

03:17.200 --> 03:20.320
 Like, or there's no input to the program.

03:20.320 --> 03:22.280
 It just runs and it gives you output.

03:22.280 --> 03:24.960
 Yeah, it goes in and it says ready,

03:24.960 --> 03:27.680
 and then you can say run, and then it would run.

03:27.680 --> 03:30.000
 But to program it, you didn't type it

03:30.000 --> 03:31.440
 because it was a printer terminal.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.760
 You would make the stack of cards

03:32.760 --> 03:35.720
 and that would get it into the computer's memory.

03:35.720 --> 03:37.920
 Okay, so where was the magic?

03:37.920 --> 03:41.480
 The magic was that you could create, you had a language

03:41.480 --> 03:43.720
 and you could create what you wanted to create, right?

03:43.720 --> 03:46.040
 You could create a world or what have you

03:46.040 --> 03:47.520
 and have this interaction.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.080
 And you could compute things, you could, you know,

03:50.080 --> 03:53.960
 do numbers, you could, I was playing Oregon Trail, right?

03:53.960 --> 03:54.800
 So you were less like.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.720
 So you can play video games.

03:56.720 --> 03:58.040
 Well, video.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.880
 Right, without the video.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.200
 You could play text games

04:01.200 --> 04:03.400
 and then imagine them in your brain, right?

04:04.520 --> 04:08.080
 Oregon Trail, there's this meme I saw recently.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.760
 If you wanna feel bad about yourself as a programmer,

04:11.760 --> 04:16.400
 realize that one person wrote Railroad Tycoon.

04:16.400 --> 04:17.760
 I think that's the name of the game.

04:17.760 --> 04:20.200
 It's this cool little builder game.

04:20.200 --> 04:22.920
 One person wrote it in assembly.

04:22.920 --> 04:27.920
 So like from scratch and for people who don't know,

04:29.320 --> 04:31.600
 it kind of looks like a Sim City type game.

04:31.600 --> 04:35.080
 It's a city builder, but obviously centered on railroads.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.920
 And there's a nice graphics, it's three dimensional,

04:36.920 --> 04:38.000
 all that kind of stuff.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.960
 All the things, all the rich colorful things

04:40.960 --> 04:43.800
 you would imagine for a three dimensional video game,

04:43.800 --> 04:45.280
 all written in assembly,

04:45.280 --> 04:48.760
 meaning the lowest level code next to binary,

04:48.760 --> 04:50.120
 which is fascinating.

04:50.120 --> 04:53.480
 And that's the, you had to notice the magic

04:53.480 --> 04:55.640
 at that low level at that time.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.120
 You didn't have all the graphics.

04:57.120 --> 05:02.040
 You didn't have all the like APIs and all the sample codes,

05:02.040 --> 05:04.440
 no stack overflow, no internet, none of that.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.360
 You just had, you had to know registers.

05:06.360 --> 05:08.240
 You know, had to know the op codes

05:08.240 --> 05:10.200
 and you had to imagine the world in your brain

05:10.200 --> 05:12.160
 and the memory structures and everything else.

05:12.160 --> 05:13.240
 There's no visualization.

05:13.240 --> 05:15.440
 You visualized it all yourself, right?

05:15.440 --> 05:16.520
 And so that was magic.

05:16.520 --> 05:18.000
 But then the next part of the magic

05:18.000 --> 05:20.360
 of where I got hooked even further

05:20.360 --> 05:22.400
 was like I'm doing these little things.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.520
 And then Electronic Arts came out for the Apple II.

05:25.520 --> 05:28.240
 So I got an Apple II and Electronic Arts came out

05:28.240 --> 05:29.920
 and I was programming and doing basic

05:29.920 --> 05:31.760
 and making my own games.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.400
 But then there were two games that really blew my mind.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.160
 One was pinball construction set.

05:37.160 --> 05:39.600
 And the other one was music construction set.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.800
 And these were both places where I could create pinball games

05:42.800 --> 05:45.040
 and I could create musical scores

05:45.040 --> 05:48.160
 because I love music and I could then play them, right?

05:48.160 --> 05:50.560
 And so when you had that, you were like,

05:50.560 --> 05:53.200
 oh, this is something very different.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.960
 So I could create myself,

05:54.960 --> 05:57.360
 but then there was others that create tools

05:57.360 --> 06:00.040
 so you could create at a visual level.

06:00.040 --> 06:01.560
 And then you would read the backstories

06:01.560 --> 06:03.520
 because Electronics Arts back in the day,

06:03.520 --> 06:06.520
 it was one programmer who would program those games

06:06.520 --> 06:08.760
 program those things, each of those things.

06:08.760 --> 06:10.200
 And you could read their backstories.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.240
 It was literally like a musician or someone else.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.560
 Like you could read Rick Rubens, like here's the thing.

06:15.560 --> 06:16.800
 They tell you all of that stuff.

06:16.800 --> 06:20.800
 And there was one guy who wrote music construction set.

06:20.800 --> 06:24.360
 He wrote it all in assembly and he was 16 years old.

06:24.360 --> 06:25.200
 Wow.

06:25.200 --> 06:28.920
 And I was probably 12 or 13 at the time.

06:28.920 --> 06:33.040
 And I went, oh my, if he was able to do this

06:33.040 --> 06:37.640
 and had published, right, and this amazing tool was created,

06:37.640 --> 06:38.760
 I'm like, what could I do?

06:38.760 --> 06:41.600
 And so then it just kept building off of that.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.520
 But really it was those seminal things.

06:43.520 --> 06:46.240
 First, the introduction and then the power

06:46.240 --> 06:48.480
 through programming and turning these things

06:48.480 --> 06:50.760
 into what you wanted to turn it into.

06:50.760 --> 06:53.960
 And you didn't have to be 40, 50 years old

06:53.960 --> 06:55.480
 and have PhDs.

06:55.480 --> 06:58.680
 And then I was like, okay, this is really cool.

06:58.680 --> 07:01.040
 I wish we did that with programmers

07:01.040 --> 07:02.560
 where we treated them like artists.

07:02.560 --> 07:05.320
 We would know the backstory these days today.

07:05.320 --> 07:07.600
 Or not just programmers, engineers.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.080
 Engineers, designers.

07:09.080 --> 07:11.400
 Yeah, like all the things about a product

07:11.400 --> 07:14.440
 that I think we love are the little details.

07:14.440 --> 07:16.160
 And there's probably a human being

07:16.160 --> 07:18.880
 behind each of those details

07:18.880 --> 07:22.520
 that had their little inkling of genius that they put in.

07:22.520 --> 07:24.080
 I wish we knew those stories.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.760
 That's always sad to me when I,

07:25.760 --> 07:28.160
 because obviously I love engineering

07:28.160 --> 07:29.640
 and I interact with companies

07:29.640 --> 07:31.960
 and they, you know, autonomous vehicles,

07:31.960 --> 07:33.200
 something I'm really interested about.

07:33.200 --> 07:35.840
 And I see that companies generally,

07:35.840 --> 07:37.160
 and we'll probably talk about this,

07:37.160 --> 07:39.560
 but they seem to want to hide their engineers.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.840
 Like engineers hold the secrets.

07:42.840 --> 07:44.720
 Like the great secret,

07:44.720 --> 07:47.160
 we did not speak of the great secret.

07:47.160 --> 07:50.680
 But then the result of that is you don't get

07:50.680 --> 07:52.440
 to hear their stories.

07:52.440 --> 07:56.280
 The passion that is there behind the engineers.

07:56.280 --> 07:59.200
 Like, and also the genius, the little,

07:59.200 --> 08:01.680
 there's a difference between the stuff that's patented,

08:01.680 --> 08:03.800
 like the kernel of the idea

08:03.800 --> 08:06.600
 and the beautiful sort of side effects of the idea.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.240
 And I wish companies revealed the beautiful side effects

08:09.240 --> 08:13.440
 a little bit more, but sorry for the distraction.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.760
 So what, you mentioned Apple II.

08:15.760 --> 08:18.680
 What was the first computer you fell in love with?

08:18.680 --> 08:21.400
 Like the product, the thing before you

08:21.400 --> 08:23.640
 that was a personal computer?

08:23.640 --> 08:25.200
 It was the Apple II.

08:25.200 --> 08:28.960
 So the Apple II was something I was just lusting over.

08:28.960 --> 08:31.440
 You know, it was, I think it was at the time,

08:31.440 --> 08:34.000
 it was the, you know, the person of the year.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.120
 Maybe it was that year.

08:35.120 --> 08:36.960
 I don't remember what, but.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.880
 Well, Apple II was the person of the year?

08:38.880 --> 08:41.720
 Yeah, for my magazine back in, I don't remember when,

08:41.720 --> 08:43.000
 but it was around that same time.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.680
 I was so young, but I had, there was the Apple II

08:46.680 --> 08:49.080
 and I didn't know what it was, but I knew about tools

08:49.080 --> 08:50.820
 because my grandfather taught me about tools

08:50.820 --> 08:53.840
 and creating things, right?

08:53.840 --> 08:56.840
 And I saw this thing and I had the, you know,

08:56.840 --> 08:59.260
 that IBM experience, that terminal experience.

08:59.260 --> 09:01.560
 And I'm like, oh, I could have that at home, right?

09:01.560 --> 09:03.080
 And so I need to have that at home.

09:03.080 --> 09:04.880
 And the only thing that was really talked about

09:04.880 --> 09:06.960
 in our circles was the Apple II.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.880
 And I was just like, that's it.

09:08.880 --> 09:11.260
 So I went, jumped up and down.

09:11.260 --> 09:12.600
 It was very expensive.

09:12.600 --> 09:13.440
 I have to have this.

09:13.440 --> 09:14.480
 My parents were like, what?

09:14.480 --> 09:19.240
 You know, it was $2,500 back then in the 1981.

09:19.240 --> 09:20.980
 It was like crazy, right?

09:20.980 --> 09:23.000
 So I was like, I'm gonna make as much money

09:23.000 --> 09:23.920
 as I can this summer.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.240
 And my grandfather said,

09:25.240 --> 09:27.600
 cause he helped me learn all about tools

09:27.600 --> 09:29.120
 and build things together.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.800
 I will match whatever you make

09:30.800 --> 09:32.200
 so you can get this computer.

09:32.200 --> 09:36.620
 So I worked very, very hard as a caddy, golf caddy.

09:36.620 --> 09:38.640
 Caddying actually for the, you know,

09:38.640 --> 09:41.000
 the families in, you know, at the country clubs

09:41.000 --> 09:43.960
 in the town where we lived.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.440
 And did whatever I could.

09:45.440 --> 09:48.380
 And that end of that summer, we got my Apple II.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.240
 And you couldn't tear it away from me.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.620
 It was my friend.

09:51.620 --> 09:52.720
 It was everything.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.640
 From a product perspective,

09:54.640 --> 09:56.960
 what do you remember that was brilliant?

09:56.960 --> 10:01.120
 The design choices, the ideas behind it,

10:01.120 --> 10:02.760
 or is it just that it exists?

10:02.760 --> 10:05.160
 Or the very idea of a personal computer

10:05.160 --> 10:07.160
 is the brilliant design choice.

10:07.160 --> 10:10.040
 Yeah, it was that I could actually have this kind of tool

10:10.040 --> 10:12.940
 in my house and I could use it anytime I wanted.

10:12.940 --> 10:14.300
 I could program it anyways.

10:14.300 --> 10:16.680
 There was no, you know, there was no internet connection.

10:16.680 --> 10:18.820
 There was no, it was all just you.

10:18.820 --> 10:22.660
 You either loaded software that you got from someone, right?

10:22.660 --> 10:24.200
 Or you created it yourself.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.740
 And then there was the whole other thing

10:25.740 --> 10:28.380
 which was started happening, which we were doing.

10:28.380 --> 10:30.340
 And this was kind of like MP3 and stuff.

10:30.340 --> 10:32.200
 We were sharing software, right?

10:32.200 --> 10:34.280
 So you built this community of sharing software.

10:34.280 --> 10:35.720
 You would go and pirate.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.780
 That was what it called, pirate all this software.

10:37.780 --> 10:39.920
 You'd never use it all, but it was just that fun thing

10:39.920 --> 10:41.800
 of like, I'm gonna get all this other stuff

10:41.800 --> 10:44.120
 and then tear it apart and do disassembly on it

10:44.120 --> 10:45.640
 and see behind the scenes.

10:45.640 --> 10:48.560
 So you really had a sense this was your world

10:48.560 --> 10:50.080
 and you owned it, right?

10:50.080 --> 10:52.560
 And you could like literally go into every register.

10:52.560 --> 10:53.920
 We didn't have all those security layers.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.160
 Like we do not like,

10:55.160 --> 10:57.560
 you could really touch bits and you could poke bits

10:57.560 --> 10:59.200
 and you can make this light turn on.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.760
 And the geek assignment just lit up.

11:01.760 --> 11:05.260
 Now there's, it's so abstract.

11:05.260 --> 11:06.380
 People don't even understand.

11:06.380 --> 11:09.100
 Like usually some programs don't even understand memory.

11:09.100 --> 11:11.320
 They just think it's unlimited, right?

11:11.320 --> 11:13.320
 And security, it's like,

11:13.320 --> 11:16.080
 now there's all this security you should have,

11:16.080 --> 11:19.160
 but it's like the adults all showed up to the party

11:19.160 --> 11:21.440
 and now you can't have all the fun, right?

11:21.440 --> 11:23.180
 It's like, no, no.

11:23.180 --> 11:26.400
 This was the thing where if you, if the power went out,

11:26.400 --> 11:27.580
 you lost your whole program,

11:27.580 --> 11:28.960
 you might've worked a whole day on it.

11:28.960 --> 11:31.760
 And if you didn't press save at every other line

11:31.760 --> 11:33.360
 and you were to save, save, save,

11:33.360 --> 11:36.520
 and it would like, the disk drive or the tape drive.

11:38.080 --> 11:41.640
 Like every single step was contemplated

11:41.640 --> 11:45.260
 because if you didn't, you lost maybe a ton of work.

11:45.260 --> 11:47.520
 So a lot of the magic was in the software.

11:47.520 --> 11:48.960
 The fact that you could have software,

11:48.960 --> 11:51.000
 the fact that you could share software,

11:51.000 --> 11:53.880
 the community around the software,

11:53.880 --> 11:55.520
 it wasn't necessarily the hardware.

11:55.520 --> 11:56.800
 Well, that was the first step.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.840
 The second step around the hardware

11:58.840 --> 12:01.240
 was I got things like the mocking board,

12:01.240 --> 12:02.680
 which the mocking board

12:02.680 --> 12:04.020
 paired with the music construction set,

12:04.020 --> 12:06.360
 you could now generate all kinds of tones and notes

12:06.360 --> 12:09.120
 and it was a synthesizer in the Apple II.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.040
 So you would plug in this card and you go,

12:11.040 --> 12:12.080
 oh my God, look at this.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.300
 And it would, you know,

12:13.300 --> 12:15.560
 you could start generating cool sounds.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.960
 You know, like it was a Moog, you know,

12:17.960 --> 12:20.320
 like a Moog in a way, early Moog.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.760
 What year are we talking about?

12:21.760 --> 12:25.820
 This is 82, I think, 81, 82.

12:25.820 --> 12:28.520
 And I bet you can make all the kind of synthetic sounds

12:28.520 --> 12:30.280
 that are very cool in the 80s.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.660
 Yeah, the 8 bit, you know, chip tunes, right?

12:32.660 --> 12:34.320
 Chip tune, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

12:34.320 --> 12:38.000
 And then, you know, when you wanted to add a joystick,

12:38.000 --> 12:39.160
 you had to pull a chip out

12:39.160 --> 12:41.200
 and you had to like plug in a dip socket

12:41.200 --> 12:42.600
 to put in a joystick.

12:42.600 --> 12:43.760
 And then I was like, oh,

12:43.760 --> 12:44.960
 and then I had to get more memory.

12:44.960 --> 12:45.880
 How do we do that?

12:45.880 --> 12:47.400
 And now I wanted to speed up progress.

12:47.400 --> 12:51.960
 So then that turned into a company actually from that,

12:51.960 --> 12:54.680
 but it was, and a hardware software went at that.

12:54.680 --> 12:55.960
 But it was all about, you know,

12:55.960 --> 12:58.560
 modifying this thing in every way, first with software.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.200
 And then you started gaining confidence.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.920
 And then I got a little bit more money and stuff.

13:01.920 --> 13:03.400
 And then you could get into the hardware

13:03.400 --> 13:05.160
 and, you know, wire things.

13:05.160 --> 13:09.280
 And then the Apple II came with all the schematics, right?

13:09.280 --> 13:12.560
 So in the back, in the early Apple IIs,

13:12.560 --> 13:14.920
 you could open up and all the schematics were there.

13:14.920 --> 13:18.040
 So you purchased the Apple II and the schematics come with it.

13:18.040 --> 13:19.560
 Yeah, it came with it.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.360
 That's an interesting choice.

13:21.360 --> 13:25.040
 That's an interesting choice from a company perspective.

13:25.040 --> 13:27.560
 Right, it was like a real maker kind of thing.

13:27.560 --> 13:28.400
 Right.

13:29.680 --> 13:32.720
 Ah, I wonder what they, so that was intentional.

13:32.720 --> 13:34.160
 Like this is. Absolutely intentional.

13:34.160 --> 13:37.280
 This is for the cutting edge folks too,

13:37.280 --> 13:38.120
 or especially for the cutting edge.

13:38.120 --> 13:39.160
 It was only the cutting edge.

13:39.160 --> 13:41.040
 It was geeks for geeks.

13:41.040 --> 13:41.880
 Yeah.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.120
 So we were like, oh, how did they make it?

13:43.120 --> 13:44.440
 And then we got to learn through that.

13:44.440 --> 13:46.280
 Apple I did the same thing, right?

13:46.280 --> 13:48.600
 It just Apple II became more packaged up

13:48.600 --> 13:52.000
 and had, you know, a little bit better software, right?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.720
 Came with basic and then, you know,

13:53.720 --> 13:57.280
 so it was really, it was what we might think of

13:57.280 --> 14:00.040
 as a raspberry pie today or something like that,

14:00.040 --> 14:01.800
 but not with so much software.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.880
 It was literally, and all the chips were out there

14:03.880 --> 14:06.040
 so you could inspect the buses and the, right?

14:06.040 --> 14:08.280
 Cause everything was just broken out.

14:08.280 --> 14:13.280
 So I guess that's the idea behind stable big projects

14:13.280 --> 14:15.840
 and open source, like on GitHub,

14:15.840 --> 14:18.160
 that you have the schematics there

14:18.160 --> 14:20.480
 and it's kind of a product,

14:20.480 --> 14:23.600
 but I wonder why more companies don't do that kind of thing.

14:23.600 --> 14:28.600
 Like we're going to release this to a small set of people,

14:29.080 --> 14:33.840
 self selected, perhaps that are kind of the makers,

14:33.840 --> 14:36.480
 the cutting edge folks, the builders,

14:36.480 --> 14:40.400
 the at home engineers, like in some way,

14:40.400 --> 14:45.400
 what Tesla is doing with the beta for the full self driving

14:45.840 --> 14:47.440
 is kind of like that.

14:47.440 --> 14:48.960
 It's like selecting a group of people,

14:48.960 --> 14:51.640
 but that has to do more with you,

14:51.640 --> 14:53.120
 how safe of a driver you are

14:53.120 --> 14:55.400
 versus how much of a tinkerer you are

14:55.400 --> 14:56.840
 because you don't get to tinker.

14:56.840 --> 14:59.960
 I wonder, is that a crazy idea to do

14:59.960 --> 15:01.960
 for really cutting edge technologies,

15:01.960 --> 15:05.460
 especially you're interested in like hardware stuff.

15:05.460 --> 15:06.840
 Is that crazy?

15:06.840 --> 15:10.200
 Why don't more companies do that kind of thing, you think?

15:10.200 --> 15:13.560
 I think back then it was about a community

15:13.560 --> 15:15.760
 and serving that community of builders.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.160
 Now this is about people who want to take,

15:18.160 --> 15:20.720
 get the experience and want it really simple and easy.

15:20.720 --> 15:24.360
 And they're like, and so there's the audience

15:24.360 --> 15:26.160
 or they believe the audience is small

15:26.160 --> 15:27.700
 who would value those other things

15:27.700 --> 15:29.040
 that we're just talking about.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.920
 But if we look at things like Raspberry Pi

15:30.920 --> 15:33.720
 and all of these other little boards, right?

15:33.720 --> 15:36.840
 There's a whole world more than I've seen.

15:36.840 --> 15:38.960
 Like it's amazing what you can do now

15:38.960 --> 15:43.560
 with these little kits and the software that's created.

15:43.560 --> 15:45.160
 And so there's a whole nother,

15:45.160 --> 15:47.520
 I think another batch of makers and builders

15:47.520 --> 15:49.080
 that are coming up through the ranks.

15:49.080 --> 15:51.640
 And if you, we look at YouTube channels and stuff, right?

15:51.640 --> 15:53.240
 They take these little boards, they hack them,

15:53.240 --> 15:56.640
 then they print out parts on their 3D printer,

15:56.640 --> 15:59.480
 assemble them and they create robots and what have you.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.880
 So I think it's happening.

16:01.880 --> 16:03.920
 It's just not as, you know, as,

16:03.920 --> 16:08.920
 it's just not as, I guess, raw as it used to be,

16:09.080 --> 16:11.840
 but it's there and it's really expanding around the world.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.280
 And that's really nice to see

16:13.280 --> 16:15.880
 cause you know, it's a whole new generation

16:15.880 --> 16:17.600
 who can, who are empowered.

16:17.600 --> 16:21.240
 I think there's a semi dormant genius amongst millions.

16:21.240 --> 16:23.560
 So like Raspberry Pi is revealing that a little bit.

16:23.560 --> 16:26.080
 It's probably, I wouldn't be surprised

16:26.080 --> 16:28.300
 if it's several million Raspberry Pis

16:28.300 --> 16:30.000
 that have been sold.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.600
 I think more than that.

16:31.600 --> 16:36.360
 And it's kind of this quiet storm of genius,

16:36.360 --> 16:38.400
 brewing of engineers who don't get to hear

16:38.400 --> 16:40.000
 because they're not organized.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.260
 I mean, we get to hear their inklings here and there.

16:42.260 --> 16:44.720
 Like I said, YouTube, there's little communities

16:44.720 --> 16:45.680
 that are local and so on.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.180
 But if they were organized,

16:49.880 --> 16:51.760
 if a leader would emerge, no.

16:51.760 --> 16:55.000
 Okay, so when did you first start to dream

16:55.000 --> 16:58.560
 about building your own things,

16:58.560 --> 17:01.320
 designing your own products,

17:01.320 --> 17:05.120
 designing your own systems and software and hardware?

17:05.120 --> 17:09.080
 Well, in high school, there was a company

17:09.080 --> 17:12.320
 that a friend of mine founded

17:12.320 --> 17:13.560
 and I was the second employee,

17:13.560 --> 17:15.680
 it was called Quality Computers.

17:15.680 --> 17:18.760
 And it was a mail order,

17:18.760 --> 17:20.400
 mail order cause there's no eCommerce then,

17:20.400 --> 17:21.740
 there was no internet again.

17:21.740 --> 17:23.560
 You either mailed in your little coupon

17:23.560 --> 17:25.280
 and you said, this is what I wanted to order

17:25.280 --> 17:28.780
 or you wrote in to get a catalog and delivered to you.

17:28.780 --> 17:30.800
 Turn around time and this stuff was like,

17:30.800 --> 17:32.560
 from the time you wanted, the time you bought it

17:32.560 --> 17:34.520
 was maybe eight to 12 weeks.

17:34.520 --> 17:37.400
 That was just the normal way of getting things.

17:37.400 --> 17:42.400
 So Quality Computers was a mail order for Apple too

17:42.440 --> 17:46.560
 and it was software and all kinds of accessories.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.080
 So hardware accessories, so hardware,

17:48.080 --> 17:50.600
 plug in cards, joysticks, all this stuff.

17:50.600 --> 17:55.600
 And what we noticed was there were accelerators

17:55.880 --> 17:57.600
 or memory cards.

17:57.600 --> 18:00.640
 And to be able to use those cards,

18:00.640 --> 18:03.720
 you had to actually go and change the software you use

18:03.720 --> 18:05.440
 to access this new memory.

18:05.440 --> 18:07.960
 So you literally had to go and you took the program

18:07.960 --> 18:09.320
 that you had, let's say it was Apple works,

18:09.320 --> 18:11.280
 which was like an early Microsoft office

18:11.280 --> 18:12.480
 or something like that.

18:12.480 --> 18:15.880
 And you had to literally change the code

18:15.880 --> 18:18.040
 and you would install all these patches

18:18.040 --> 18:20.360
 to then take advantage of the hardware.

18:20.360 --> 18:23.540
 So what we started creating was software on top of it

18:23.540 --> 18:27.760
 to do the automatic installation of all of these patches.

18:27.760 --> 18:30.520
 So we made it much easier to take new hardware

18:30.520 --> 18:33.360
 and the existing software you have

18:33.360 --> 18:35.360
 and expand it into this new world.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.520
 So it was creating tools

18:36.520 --> 18:38.280
 and the really great customer support.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.960
 And we started getting a lot of orders

18:40.960 --> 18:43.540
 because we had the software make it easier to install,

18:43.540 --> 18:45.480
 to give them the superpower.

18:45.480 --> 18:49.680
 And at the same time, they would be able

18:49.680 --> 18:52.120
 to change their software and have a new world

18:52.120 --> 18:53.960
 that wasn't existing from the companies

18:53.960 --> 18:56.440
 that were creating the initial products.

18:56.440 --> 18:58.000
 And so it was more of that.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.760
 And then that happened with hard drives.

19:00.760 --> 19:04.640
 So I wrote a hard drive optimizer for the Apple II

19:04.640 --> 19:07.440
 to like read, because you could get really fragmented.

19:07.440 --> 19:08.880
 So I wrote that piece of software

19:08.880 --> 19:10.120
 and we sold that through the company

19:10.120 --> 19:12.980
 along with the hard drives that we sold from third parties.

19:12.980 --> 19:17.240
 So that all happened in 12th grade,

19:17.240 --> 19:18.740
 freshman year of college.

19:20.080 --> 19:23.200
 You wrote a hard drive optimizer in 12th grade

19:23.200 --> 19:24.560
 for the Apple II.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.760
 Between 12th and freshman year.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.440
 What programming language do you remember?

19:28.440 --> 19:29.280
 Is it assemblies?

19:29.280 --> 19:32.080
 There were certain inner loops were assembly

19:32.080 --> 19:35.280
 and other loops actually there were really early Pascal,

19:35.280 --> 19:39.560
 no C compilers.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.440
 What was the motivation behind these?

19:41.440 --> 19:43.800
 Is it to make people's lives easier?

19:43.800 --> 19:45.680
 Is it to create a thing experience

19:45.680 --> 19:47.800
 that is simpler and simpler and simpler,

19:47.800 --> 19:51.080
 thereby more accessible to a larger number of people?

19:51.080 --> 19:52.960
 Or did you just like to tinker?

19:52.960 --> 19:54.440
 No, no, no, it was two things really.

19:54.440 --> 19:57.680
 Cause one, we wanted to sell more hardware and software.

19:57.680 --> 19:59.920
 So it was like, oh, make it easier for the user.

19:59.920 --> 20:01.040
 And then the other thing was,

20:01.040 --> 20:03.680
 because I was also manning the customer support line,

20:04.760 --> 20:06.600
 people would call in and go, this doesn't work.

20:06.600 --> 20:09.120
 And I'm like, oh, I gotta go fix the hardware and software.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.880
 Or I gotta fix the software to make the hardware

20:10.880 --> 20:12.440
 and the installation process better.

20:12.440 --> 20:16.000
 So my whole world was out of box experience

20:16.000 --> 20:18.520
 from when I was in high school.

20:18.520 --> 20:20.640
 Cause I had to man the customer support line,

20:20.640 --> 20:23.000
 pack the boxes and write some of the code

20:23.000 --> 20:25.280
 while we were doing, while Joe, Joe Gleason,

20:25.280 --> 20:27.120
 who was the founder of Quality Computers,

20:27.120 --> 20:30.160
 he was off doing the mark, the ads,

20:30.160 --> 20:32.360
 placing the ads for the mail order,

20:32.360 --> 20:35.920
 making sure we were running the credit cards, right?

20:35.920 --> 20:36.880
 It was two of us.

20:36.880 --> 20:38.360
 And then it turned into a third,

20:38.360 --> 20:40.000
 and then we hired another person from high school

20:40.000 --> 20:41.760
 to like pack boxes so I could stay

20:41.760 --> 20:44.560
 on the customer support line or doing the software, right?

20:44.560 --> 20:47.680
 And it was all in his parents basement, right?

20:47.680 --> 20:50.320
 As you were scaling exponentially.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.720
 Scaling, right, exactly, bootstrapping.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.400
 So we'll jump around a little bit,

20:54.400 --> 20:56.480
 but what were the, you said you love music.

20:56.480 --> 20:59.720
 What were the ideas that gave birth to the iPod

20:59.720 --> 21:04.720
 if we jump forward and how far back do those ideas stretch?

21:07.440 --> 21:09.560
 If you look at the history of technology,

21:11.280 --> 21:14.600
 there's, I mean, not just the product,

21:14.600 --> 21:17.960
 but the idea is truly revolutionary.

21:17.960 --> 21:21.240
 Maybe it's time has come,

21:21.240 --> 21:25.760
 but just if you look at the arc of history,

21:25.760 --> 21:30.760
 sort of music is so fundamental to who we are as a humanity.

21:30.760 --> 21:34.160
 And to be able to put that in your pocket,

21:34.160 --> 21:36.560
 make it truly portable is fascinating

21:36.560 --> 21:40.200
 in a way that's truly portable.

21:40.200 --> 21:44.040
 So it's digital as opposed to sort of like a Walkman

21:44.040 --> 21:45.160
 or something like that.

21:45.160 --> 21:49.760
 So what were the ideas that gave birth to the iPod?

21:49.760 --> 21:53.040
 You know, I was in love with music since I was a kid.

21:53.040 --> 21:55.760
 Just loved music from, I think, second grade

21:55.760 --> 21:58.160
 when I got my first albums and stuff like that.

21:58.160 --> 21:59.680
 What kind of music are we talking about?

21:59.680 --> 22:04.000
 So this was Led Zeppelin.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.200
 This was the Stones, Hendrix, Aerosmith,

22:10.720 --> 22:14.120
 Cheap Trick, Stix, Ted Nugent,

22:14.120 --> 22:19.120
 just the real American and British rock and roll, right?

22:19.120 --> 22:20.560
 There's a bunch of people listening right now.

22:20.560 --> 22:22.040
 Who's that?

22:22.040 --> 22:22.880
 Who's that?

22:22.880 --> 22:23.720
 Led Zeppelin?

22:23.720 --> 22:24.540
 What is that?

22:24.540 --> 22:25.380
 Is that some kind?

22:25.380 --> 22:26.220
 Oh, yeah.

22:26.220 --> 22:29.400
 It drove my parents crazy.

22:29.400 --> 22:30.240
 Yeah.

22:30.240 --> 22:31.640
 You just blasted loud.

22:31.640 --> 22:32.880
 Loud, just brr.

22:32.880 --> 22:35.080
 And this was second, third grade, fourth grade.

22:35.080 --> 22:36.120
 I just fell in love.

22:36.120 --> 22:40.520
 And then we moved back to Detroit

22:40.520 --> 22:43.000
 and I loved listening to the radio station

22:43.000 --> 22:44.960
 because there was all kinds of crazy music

22:44.960 --> 22:48.200
 because you'd have an amalgam of rock and then funk

22:48.200 --> 22:50.320
 and R&B and I loved to listen at night.

22:50.320 --> 22:51.700
 So I had a clock radio.

22:52.680 --> 22:54.660
 But if I had the clock radio on,

22:54.660 --> 22:57.240
 everyone, parents would go, go to sleep.

22:57.240 --> 22:58.080
 Stop that.

22:58.080 --> 22:58.900
 Turn that stuff off.

22:58.900 --> 23:02.240
 So I hacked the clock radio and put a headphone jack in it.

23:02.240 --> 23:03.720
 Nice.

23:03.720 --> 23:04.560
 Right?

23:04.560 --> 23:06.240
 So I said, oh, they're like, okay.

23:07.080 --> 23:09.160
 And then I could listen to it all night

23:09.160 --> 23:10.360
 and no one could hear me, right?

23:10.360 --> 23:12.240
 And I could just sit there and, you know.

23:12.240 --> 23:13.840
 Just huddling around the radio.

23:13.840 --> 23:14.680
 Groove out.

23:14.680 --> 23:15.920
 Just listening to Zeppelin.

23:15.920 --> 23:19.200
 Stairway to Heaven, what would you say

23:19.200 --> 23:23.040
 is the greatest classic rock song of all time?

23:23.040 --> 23:25.500
 Greatest classic rock song of all time?

23:25.500 --> 23:26.520
 What pops into mind?

23:26.520 --> 23:27.720
 Well, no, you know what?

23:27.720 --> 23:29.760
 I mean, this has to be objectively number one.

23:29.760 --> 23:30.600
 That's really hard, dude.

23:30.600 --> 23:31.420
 This is so hard.

23:31.420 --> 23:32.260
 No, you have to.

23:32.260 --> 23:34.580
 This is a serious journalistic interview.

23:34.580 --> 23:37.040
 You're not going to back down from these kinds of questions.

23:37.040 --> 23:37.880
 Oh my God.

23:37.880 --> 23:38.720
 No, I don't know.

23:38.720 --> 23:39.540
 What a challenge.

23:39.540 --> 23:40.860
 Yeah, it's hard to pick.

23:40.860 --> 23:45.640
 But to me, Stairway to Heaven is a safe fall.

23:45.640 --> 23:47.840
 It's like, it's so often considered

23:47.840 --> 23:49.640
 to be one of the greatest songs of all time

23:49.640 --> 23:51.680
 that you almost don't want to pick it.

23:51.680 --> 23:52.560
 Right, exactly.

23:52.560 --> 23:54.480
 But you've returned to it time and time again.

23:54.480 --> 23:58.120
 It's like, yeah, this is something pretty special.

23:58.120 --> 24:00.720
 This is a rock opera of sorts.

24:00.720 --> 24:03.160
 Well, the rock opera that really blew me away

24:03.160 --> 24:04.720
 and still continues to blow me away

24:04.720 --> 24:07.240
 is all of Dark Side of the Moon.

24:07.240 --> 24:10.000
 Like that, I love Zeppelin.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.120
 I can't say which one's better.

24:12.120 --> 24:13.900
 But Dark Side of the Moon for me was,

24:13.900 --> 24:16.800
 it was a, you know, audio experience, right?

24:16.800 --> 24:18.200
 The whole thing from soup to nuts,

24:18.200 --> 24:21.320
 plus all the synthesizers, all of those things.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.760
 Okay, so back to the iPod.

24:23.760 --> 24:26.520
 So that's, from the early age, you loved music.

24:26.520 --> 24:27.540
 Loved it.

24:27.540 --> 24:28.380
 Absolutely loved it.

24:28.380 --> 24:30.500
 And, you know, always was just around it

24:30.500 --> 24:33.600
 and always, I just, it was always playing, you know.

24:34.440 --> 24:37.800
 I played it so loud that I actually hurt the earring

24:37.800 --> 24:39.640
 in my right ear.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.600
 And I still suffer from that today.

24:41.600 --> 24:42.920
 And then.

24:42.920 --> 24:43.760
 No regrets.

24:43.760 --> 24:44.880
 No regrets whatsoever.

24:44.880 --> 24:47.480
 Going to concerts in downtown Detroit

24:47.480 --> 24:48.320
 and all the crazy stuff.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.660
 So moving forward.

24:50.920 --> 24:54.960
 So in college, I was a DJ.

24:54.960 --> 24:58.640
 So I would DJ and hang out and play all the tunes I love

24:58.640 --> 25:01.040
 and whatever for the crowd.

25:01.040 --> 25:03.640
 And then I continued to do that in Silicon Valley

25:03.640 --> 25:06.760
 when I moved right after school.

25:06.760 --> 25:10.240
 And so I was be lugging all of these CDs around with me.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.320
 A thousand CDs to, right?

25:12.320 --> 25:16.740
 And at the same time, and so those were heavy.

25:16.740 --> 25:20.320
 And at the same time I was doing the Philips Nino and Velo.

25:20.320 --> 25:23.960
 Those were Windows CE based mobile computing products.

25:25.640 --> 25:28.000
 Nino was the first device

25:28.000 --> 25:30.440
 to actually put Audible books on tape.

25:30.440 --> 25:32.200
 So I worked with Audible.

25:32.200 --> 25:34.280
 We met in a conference and they were like,

25:34.280 --> 25:35.120
 we don't want to do hardware.

25:35.120 --> 25:36.160
 We just want to do content.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.900
 I was like, well, we have this device.

25:37.900 --> 25:39.560
 Let's get it together.

25:39.560 --> 25:41.080
 And we got Audible on that.

25:41.080 --> 25:46.080
 And this was in 96 or seven, first Audible books.

25:46.200 --> 25:49.400
 And it, you know, I was like, oh my God, that's audio.

25:49.400 --> 25:52.360
 Well, what if we put music on it, right?

25:52.360 --> 25:56.180
 And so I, and the memory was very small at the time, right?

25:56.180 --> 25:57.800
 There was almost no flash.

25:57.800 --> 25:58.640
 It was all DRAM.

25:58.640 --> 26:03.080
 When you did Audible, you stored it in DRAM, right?

26:03.080 --> 26:04.760
 Which was okay probably

26:04.760 --> 26:09.760
 because how much books do you need is the idea.

26:09.760 --> 26:12.940
 By the way, brilliant, I mean, just putting books.

26:12.940 --> 26:15.620
 I know it's probably not the sexiest of things,

26:15.620 --> 26:20.620
 but putting books on a mobile device is a brilliant step.

26:21.940 --> 26:23.160
 I don't know.

26:23.160 --> 26:27.540
 Sometimes can't measure how much human progress occurred

26:27.540 --> 26:29.140
 because of an invention.

26:29.140 --> 26:32.060
 Like there's the sexy big products, but you never know.

26:32.060 --> 26:34.380
 Like, like Wikipedia is one of those things

26:34.380 --> 26:37.340
 that doesn't get enough, I think, credit

26:37.340 --> 26:39.700
 for the transformational effects it has.

26:39.700 --> 26:43.180
 It's not seen as the sexiest of products, but maybe it is.

26:43.180 --> 26:47.460
 When you look at human history, Wikipedia arguably

26:47.460 --> 26:48.660
 is one of the big things

26:48.660 --> 26:52.660
 that basically unlocked human knowledge.

26:52.660 --> 26:55.420
 Human knowledge and human editing and human, you know,

26:55.420 --> 26:59.480
 just the human nature of building something together.

26:59.480 --> 27:00.320
 Yeah.

27:00.320 --> 27:01.540
 So it's fascinating.

27:01.540 --> 27:02.960
 Sometimes you can't measure those things,

27:02.960 --> 27:04.940
 maybe until many, many decades later.

27:04.940 --> 27:05.900
 Anyway, sorry.

27:05.900 --> 27:09.220
 So that was, that was, you know, that was, so that was there.

27:09.220 --> 27:10.580
 And then there was Audible,

27:10.580 --> 27:13.380
 that you put books, why not put music?

27:13.380 --> 27:16.600
 Music, and I'm carrying around the music for the DJ gigs.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.380
 And you're like, wait a second, two and two together, right?

27:19.380 --> 27:20.640
 Like, let's get rid of this.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.140
 And so, and then MP3 show up.

27:23.140 --> 27:24.460
 The actual, like in COVID?

27:24.460 --> 27:29.220
 The format, the format, MP3 showed up around 97, 98.

27:29.220 --> 27:33.220
 So MP3 is compressed so you can have,

27:34.080 --> 27:35.820
 like the storage is reduced significantly.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.780
 Right, so you could go from a, you know,

27:37.780 --> 27:42.020
 a large full lossless, you know,

27:42.020 --> 27:45.580
 digital track into something that can be stored

27:45.580 --> 27:47.700
 in four to eight megabytes,

27:47.700 --> 27:49.140
 something like that for the audio.

27:49.140 --> 27:51.260
 Now, you know, that's a reduced quality,

27:51.260 --> 27:54.140
 but you could get it down there and you're like, oh, okay.

27:54.140 --> 27:56.500
 And now if we have enough flash or DRAM,

27:56.500 --> 28:00.460
 we can put 10, 15, what have you all in that same memory.

28:00.460 --> 28:02.780
 And it starts to replicate a CD.

28:02.780 --> 28:05.060
 And then ultimately, if you put it on a hard drive,

28:05.060 --> 28:07.720
 you could start to put, you know, thousands of songs.

28:07.720 --> 28:10.180
 Yeah, that's also another brilliant invention.

28:10.180 --> 28:11.780
 But like, people don't realize,

28:11.780 --> 28:14.940
 I think people would be surprised how big

28:14.940 --> 28:17.740
 in terms of storage raw audio is.

28:17.740 --> 28:19.980
 And the fact that you can compress it,

28:19.980 --> 28:24.020
 like, I don't know what the compression is,

28:24.020 --> 28:26.820
 but it's like 10X, it's very significant compression.

28:26.820 --> 28:29.700
 And still it sounds almost lossless.

28:29.700 --> 28:31.700
 Much to the chagrin of Neil Young,

28:31.700 --> 28:33.860
 who does not like that.

28:33.860 --> 28:37.380
 But even Neil Young, even the stuff he talks about

28:37.380 --> 28:40.700
 is still tiny files relative to the raw.

28:40.700 --> 28:43.700
 So he wants us to increase it just a little bit more,

28:43.700 --> 28:44.780
 a little bit more.

28:44.780 --> 28:46.860
 But it's still, that's an invention.

28:46.860 --> 28:49.420
 That's a thing that unlocks your ability

28:49.420 --> 28:52.340
 to carry around a device like a Nino and listen to music.

28:52.340 --> 28:53.900
 Because without that, there's no way

28:53.900 --> 28:56.300
 you can carry on a gigantic hard drive.

28:56.300 --> 28:57.420
 Right, exactly.

28:57.420 --> 29:01.300
 And so then that, so it was MP3s, the Nino,

29:01.300 --> 29:04.580
 and my, you know, my hatred of carrying around

29:04.580 --> 29:08.460
 all this heavy stuff that then spawned, you know,

29:08.460 --> 29:11.460
 fuse and then ultimately, you know,

29:11.460 --> 29:15.020
 became a lot of that, the ideas and things of that nature

29:15.020 --> 29:19.060
 were, and my passions were born into then the iPod.

29:19.060 --> 29:21.500
 You know, it was too, Apple needed something

29:21.500 --> 29:24.700
 and I wanted to fix something and it all kind of,

29:24.700 --> 29:27.160
 you know, came together at the right place, right time,

29:27.160 --> 29:29.060
 plus the right technology came at this.

29:29.060 --> 29:31.420
 It was just like the stars aligned.

29:31.420 --> 29:33.500
 So how did it come to life?

29:33.500 --> 29:38.500
 The details of the stars aligning, but the actual design,

29:39.220 --> 29:42.900
 the actual engineering of getting a device to be small,

29:42.900 --> 29:47.900
 the storage of the, you know, the interface, how it looks,

29:49.140 --> 29:51.420
 the storage, the details of the software,

29:51.420 --> 29:52.480
 all that kind of stuff.

29:52.480 --> 29:57.020
 What are some interesting memories from that design process?

29:57.020 --> 30:02.020
 What are some wisdoms you can impart from that process?

30:02.020 --> 30:05.740
 Okay, well, you know, how long do you want to go?

30:05.740 --> 30:07.940
 Cause I have, I can go deep.

30:07.940 --> 30:11.340
 So, let's go at least 20 hours.

30:11.340 --> 30:14.860
 Let's go, this is one of the lengthy documentaries.

30:14.860 --> 30:18.820
 Are you going to turn it into episodic binge listening?

30:18.820 --> 30:20.140
 Yeah, it's Game of Thrones.

30:20.140 --> 30:23.100
 So let's just start with, you know,

30:23.100 --> 30:24.660
 after I was asked to be a consultant

30:24.660 --> 30:26.380
 to put this thing together.

30:26.380 --> 30:28.420
 So I already had knowledge of, you know,

30:28.420 --> 30:31.060
 the space and the technology and all that stuff,

30:31.060 --> 30:34.700
 but I had to very quickly, and a lot of the suppliers,

30:34.700 --> 30:36.100
 because of what I was doing at Fuse,

30:36.100 --> 30:37.300
 trying to create that thing.

30:37.300 --> 30:42.300
 So as a contractor, I was like, okay,

30:42.420 --> 30:43.700
 what is the first thing they need to do?

30:43.700 --> 30:48.540
 So after I showed a, you know, different architectures

30:48.540 --> 30:51.520
 and what three different products could be to Steve

30:51.520 --> 30:54.740
 about options for storage options, battery options,

30:54.740 --> 30:57.740
 form factor options, there was three options.

30:57.740 --> 31:02.060
 And as I was told, given very good advice,

31:02.060 --> 31:04.560
 give the two options you really do not like,

31:04.560 --> 31:06.560
 but they're options, and give the best option last,

31:06.560 --> 31:08.520
 because Steve will shoot all those down

31:08.520 --> 31:10.500
 and give the best option last,

31:10.500 --> 31:11.900
 and then you could talk about that.

31:11.900 --> 31:16.900
 And so that was the one that had a 1.8 inch hard drive

31:18.820 --> 31:23.220
 and a small screen, like the screen, you know it,

31:23.220 --> 31:26.860
 and the original iPod, classic iPod.

31:26.860 --> 31:30.620
 And then I had enough of the idea of the three

31:30.620 --> 31:35.500
 or three or four different CPUs and processor suppliers

31:35.500 --> 31:37.780
 and kind of systems that were out there

31:37.780 --> 31:41.380
 that I had gone and found and put together on power supplies,

31:41.380 --> 31:43.760
 you know, disk drive interfaces,

31:43.760 --> 31:45.460
 firewire interface, all that stuff.

31:45.460 --> 31:48.660
 So I put together all of those schematics

31:48.660 --> 31:49.820
 or, you know, block diagrams.

31:49.820 --> 31:52.020
 They weren't schematics yet, because it was just me.

31:52.020 --> 31:54.700
 And coming up with a bill of materials,

31:54.700 --> 31:56.240
 coming up with what it could look like,

31:56.240 --> 31:58.260
 what would be the input, output,

31:58.260 --> 32:01.540
 how we could make a better headphone jack.

32:02.420 --> 32:03.700
 That was also on there.

32:03.700 --> 32:07.140
 Screen suppliers, tearing apart calculators.

32:07.140 --> 32:09.340
 So got all calculators and all kinds of electronics

32:09.340 --> 32:14.340
 to get the right size, different sizes of small LCDs.

32:14.980 --> 32:17.300
 So I got all kinds of different battery types.

32:17.300 --> 32:19.260
 I got different types of, you know,

32:19.260 --> 32:22.380
 in different battery sizes, double A's, triple A's,

32:22.380 --> 32:24.280
 working through all the different,

32:24.280 --> 32:26.180
 and there was lithium ion, nickel metal hydride.

32:26.180 --> 32:27.900
 So I took all the battery types.

32:27.900 --> 32:31.980
 I took all of the memory types, processing types,

32:31.980 --> 32:36.980
 LCD types, and connectivity and all that stuff,

32:38.260 --> 32:40.180
 not wireless, but wired,

32:40.180 --> 32:44.060
 and laid out these things as Lego blocks.

32:44.060 --> 32:46.300
 So literally had all of these things as just,

32:46.300 --> 32:48.900
 and so it made them so I could like, you know,

32:48.900 --> 32:50.260
 put them together and figure out

32:50.260 --> 32:52.940
 what the compact form factor would be.

32:52.940 --> 32:55.380
 Oh, like how do we shove them together?

32:55.380 --> 32:57.380
 What's the smallest possible box you can get?

32:57.380 --> 33:01.220
 So the questions was on storage, so the hard drive,

33:01.220 --> 33:06.020
 batteries, double A, triple A, screens.

33:06.020 --> 33:07.780
 So screen size, and then for that,

33:07.780 --> 33:09.980
 you're tearing apart calculators.

33:09.980 --> 33:11.620
 Calculators, digital cameras, whatever,

33:11.620 --> 33:12.740
 and getting little things, right?

33:12.740 --> 33:14.780
 So you can make it physical, right?

33:14.780 --> 33:17.060
 If you can make the intangible tangible,

33:17.060 --> 33:19.180
 like, and so I can say, look, we can make this,

33:19.180 --> 33:21.540
 and I brought this whole bag of goods,

33:21.540 --> 33:23.580
 and it was like, right?

33:23.580 --> 33:25.260
 And like, here's this, here's this,

33:25.260 --> 33:26.980
 this is why double A's won't work,

33:26.980 --> 33:28.540
 and because it makes it too fat and everything.

33:28.540 --> 33:30.380
 So just educate everybody through,

33:30.380 --> 33:32.380
 here's the parts that we can use.

33:32.380 --> 33:34.060
 You should not sheet of paper, it's physical.

33:34.060 --> 33:35.340
 You're playing in the physical space.

33:35.340 --> 33:36.740
 Oh, I would go back and forth.

33:36.740 --> 33:38.820
 So truth be told,

33:38.820 --> 33:40.980
 because there weren't a good enough graphical tools

33:40.980 --> 33:45.980
 on the Mac, I was using a PC with Visio and some 3D tools,

33:46.380 --> 33:49.140
 and I was doing 3D design at the same time

33:49.140 --> 33:51.060
 I was taking all these physical parts and going,

33:51.060 --> 33:52.260
 okay, what feels right?

33:52.260 --> 33:54.220
 Because you have to go from, you know,

33:54.220 --> 33:56.220
 the details and then the rough,

33:56.220 --> 33:58.340
 and you go back and forth and you iterate, right?

33:58.340 --> 34:00.260
 And so it was just a lot of fun.

34:00.260 --> 34:03.140
 And then it ultimately ended up with a styrofoam model

34:03.140 --> 34:05.380
 and printouts that came from Visio

34:05.380 --> 34:08.300
 that I glued together and put my grandfather's

34:08.300 --> 34:09.140
 fishing weights in,

34:09.140 --> 34:11.700
 because I also modeled the weights, right?

34:11.700 --> 34:13.860
 So I said, oh, this is this many ounces,

34:13.860 --> 34:15.660
 this is this many ounces and grams.

34:15.660 --> 34:17.100
 And then I went and got all that

34:17.100 --> 34:21.300
 and made the, weighted these styrofoam models

34:21.300 --> 34:22.580
 to then match that.

34:22.580 --> 34:23.460
 So when you picked it up,

34:23.460 --> 34:25.540
 it felt more or less form factor, right?

34:25.540 --> 34:27.980
 And it also, you felt how much, you know,

34:27.980 --> 34:29.660
 was it gonna be dense enough?

34:29.660 --> 34:34.140
 Is it gonna feel solid and rigid in your hand, right?

34:34.140 --> 34:36.060
 Why does it need to feel rigid?

34:36.060 --> 34:37.740
 Because it has to feel substantial.

34:37.740 --> 34:39.540
 It has to feel like I have like a,

34:39.540 --> 34:41.620
 like a bar of gold in my hand, right?

34:41.620 --> 34:43.500
 You know, maybe you know this,

34:43.500 --> 34:45.540
 when you open and close a car door,

34:45.540 --> 34:47.180
 you know that thunk and you go, bam,

34:47.180 --> 34:49.340
 and you go, that feels solid, that feels real.

34:49.340 --> 34:52.340
 And then you get this tinny car that's like ding,

34:52.340 --> 34:54.460
 and you're like, does this feel safe?

34:54.460 --> 34:55.980
 Does this feel like a value?

34:55.980 --> 34:58.380
 And so you, when you have a device like that,

34:58.380 --> 35:00.980
 and you wanna make sure that there's not too much air in it,

35:00.980 --> 35:04.780
 that you distributed the density of the masses

35:04.780 --> 35:05.700
 in the right way.

35:05.700 --> 35:07.540
 So it feels like it's the right thing.

35:07.540 --> 35:12.140
 So you have to model battery life, costs,

35:12.140 --> 35:16.140
 you know, mass, sizes of different things.

35:16.140 --> 35:17.420
 And then you have to also think about

35:17.420 --> 35:19.140
 what the UI is gonna look like, right?

35:19.140 --> 35:21.140
 You have all of these constraints you're working,

35:21.140 --> 35:22.500
 variables you're working with,

35:22.500 --> 35:24.220
 and you have to kind of, you know,

35:24.220 --> 35:26.260
 you can't get the perfect of everything.

35:26.260 --> 35:29.220
 What's the best, you know, local maximum

35:29.220 --> 35:31.260
 of all of these components that come together

35:31.260 --> 35:32.380
 to provide an experience?

35:32.380 --> 35:34.260
 Local maximum, it's always trade offs.

35:34.260 --> 35:35.700
 What about buttons?

35:35.700 --> 35:37.860
 Buttons, well, there was also the buttons too, right?

35:37.860 --> 35:39.500
 Oh, by the way, a lot of these battles

35:39.500 --> 35:41.900
 fought inside your mind, or is it with other people?

35:41.900 --> 35:44.820
 Is it with Steve, is it lower, like what?

35:44.820 --> 35:46.100
 This was all independent.

35:46.100 --> 35:48.500
 This was me before being able to present to Steve,

35:48.500 --> 35:51.020
 because I had to feel really confident

35:51.020 --> 35:53.940
 that if I was gonna put this in front of him,

35:53.940 --> 35:55.260
 that it could be made, right?

35:55.260 --> 35:56.980
 So I had to convince myself

35:56.980 --> 35:58.580
 and go work through all the details,

35:58.580 --> 36:01.340
 through like the very, very rough mechanical design,

36:01.340 --> 36:03.820
 electrical design, software things,

36:03.820 --> 36:05.260
 because I didn't wanna present something

36:05.260 --> 36:07.020
 that was gonna be fictional, right?

36:07.020 --> 36:10.180
 My credibility would be like trashed, right?

36:10.180 --> 36:12.020
 So you mentioned convince yourself.

36:13.140 --> 36:15.700
 You're painting this beautiful picture

36:15.700 --> 36:19.700
 of a driven engineer, designer, futurist.

36:21.900 --> 36:24.900
 How much doubt were you plagued by through that?

36:24.900 --> 36:26.340
 Like this is even doable,

36:26.340 --> 36:29.900
 because it's not obvious that this is even doable.

36:29.900 --> 36:33.100
 Like to do this at scale, to do this kind of thing,

36:33.100 --> 36:38.100
 to make it sexy, to shovel the screen,

36:39.700 --> 36:42.620
 the batteries, the storage, to make the interface,

36:42.620 --> 36:45.140
 the hardware and the software interface work, all of that.

36:45.140 --> 36:46.100
 I mean, I don't know.

36:46.100 --> 36:48.220
 I would be overwhelmed by the doubt of that,

36:48.220 --> 36:51.580
 because so many things have to work, plus the supply chain.

36:51.580 --> 36:52.660
 Like at that point,

36:52.660 --> 36:55.580
 I wasn't getting into any of those details or anything.

36:55.580 --> 36:58.660
 There's the basic stuff that you have to put together.

36:58.660 --> 37:00.300
 And then you have to,

37:00.300 --> 37:01.860
 through my learnings at General Magic

37:01.860 --> 37:02.940
 and my learnings at Phillips

37:02.940 --> 37:06.940
 and delivering multiple large scale programs

37:06.940 --> 37:09.180
 and manufacturing, you kind of get a rule of thumb

37:09.180 --> 37:11.300
 and you know what to focus on at the beginning

37:11.300 --> 37:13.500
 and what not to worry about over time.

37:13.500 --> 37:14.820
 Like when I was early in my career,

37:14.820 --> 37:16.940
 I worried about everything on the engineering details

37:16.940 --> 37:19.780
 so much so that I would be a nervous wreck.

37:19.780 --> 37:21.700
 Sooner or later, you learn how to filter out

37:21.700 --> 37:23.660
 and figure out what to prioritize.

37:23.660 --> 37:25.300
 And so 10 years later,

37:25.300 --> 37:27.340
 I was able to do a much better job

37:27.340 --> 37:29.380
 of filtering out the things of like,

37:29.380 --> 37:31.740
 we'll get to that in weeks to come.

37:31.740 --> 37:36.100
 But right now we gotta solve the very important things,

37:36.100 --> 37:39.260
 which is could this actually be something real

37:39.260 --> 37:42.700
 and that you could deliver enough battery life, right?

37:42.700 --> 37:46.860
 Enough of an interface of the right cost, right?

37:46.860 --> 37:49.060
 And the right price point.

37:49.060 --> 37:51.620
 So you were sitting on a track record

37:51.620 --> 37:54.460
 of successes and failures in your own mind

37:54.460 --> 37:57.300
 where you had sort of already a confidence,

37:57.300 --> 38:01.260
 a calmness, but still,

38:01.260 --> 38:03.500
 was there a doubt that you can get this done?

38:03.500 --> 38:05.180
 Always, always.

38:05.180 --> 38:08.460
 How hard is it to achieve a sort of a confidence

38:08.460 --> 38:10.300
 to a level where you could present it to Steve

38:10.300 --> 38:13.460
 and actually believe that this is doable?

38:13.460 --> 38:15.300
 Like what, do you remember when you felt?

38:15.300 --> 38:16.140
 Yeah, that moment?

38:16.140 --> 38:16.980
 Yeah.

38:16.980 --> 38:19.540
 I think it was after I triple checked my,

38:19.540 --> 38:22.540
 I couldn't bring anyone in, right?

38:22.540 --> 38:24.460
 I couldn't let anyone in on this.

38:24.460 --> 38:25.940
 So it was just me.

38:25.940 --> 38:27.660
 Are they gonna trample on it, that kind of thing?

38:27.660 --> 38:28.500
 Why? No, no, no, no,

38:28.500 --> 38:29.540
 because I couldn't bring any,

38:29.540 --> 38:31.220
 when I mean bring anyone in on this,

38:31.220 --> 38:33.780
 one, it was a highly confidential program inside Apple.

38:33.780 --> 38:36.500
 There was like four people who knew about it, right?

38:36.500 --> 38:38.220
 And so I couldn't bring anyone from Apple

38:38.220 --> 38:40.060
 because I was a contractor.

38:40.060 --> 38:42.100
 I couldn't bring anyone else from the outside world.

38:42.100 --> 38:45.460
 I'm working for Apple and I'm under this crazy NDA, right?

38:45.460 --> 38:46.580
 In this contract.

38:46.580 --> 38:50.740
 So it was just, so I'm doing this.

38:50.740 --> 38:51.660
 Oh, and at the same time,

38:51.660 --> 38:54.180
 I'm also buying every competitive product, MP3 player

38:54.180 --> 38:55.900
 and tearing them all apart, right?

38:55.900 --> 38:58.300
 Tore them all apart and looking at them

38:58.300 --> 39:00.100
 and trying to learn from those as well.

39:00.100 --> 39:02.340
 So it was all of this stuff in six weeks.

39:02.340 --> 39:05.380
 So I didn't sleep, right?

39:05.380 --> 39:06.420
 Yeah, yeah.

39:06.420 --> 39:09.340
 But I was like, because I was trying to make this,

39:09.340 --> 39:12.740
 I was envisioning this since the Nino, right?

39:12.740 --> 39:15.220
 And I was like, oh my God, right?

39:15.220 --> 39:17.140
 But there was another doubt that I had

39:17.140 --> 39:19.540
 and it wasn't just, could you make the product?

39:19.540 --> 39:24.540
 But could Apple actually have the balls to make it?

39:25.140 --> 39:27.220
 Because Apple was not the same company

39:28.740 --> 39:31.500
 that you know it today in 2001.

39:31.500 --> 39:34.060
 Really, it was cautious, conservative, careful?

39:34.060 --> 39:36.300
 No, no, it was barely break even.

39:36.300 --> 39:39.460
 It was a four or $5 billion company.

39:39.460 --> 39:42.100
 So the guts required there is not necessarily

39:42.100 --> 39:43.020
 in the innovation.

39:43.020 --> 39:45.220
 It's like, this is gonna cost a lot of money

39:45.220 --> 39:47.100
 and we're gonna potentially lose all of it

39:47.100 --> 39:49.620
 because it'll be a flop.

39:49.620 --> 39:52.980
 Well, there's not just that, but there was only the Mac.

39:52.980 --> 39:55.580
 And the Mac wasn't doing very well.

39:55.580 --> 39:57.540
 There was less, it was about a 1%

39:57.540 --> 40:01.020
 only in the US market share for the Mac, right?

40:01.020 --> 40:02.660
 The company was in debt.

40:02.660 --> 40:07.620
 Bill Gates had to give him a loan, right?

40:07.620 --> 40:09.780
 Michael Dell at the time was saying,

40:09.780 --> 40:11.700
 shut down the company and give the money back

40:11.700 --> 40:12.980
 to the shareholders.

40:13.900 --> 40:17.380
 So this is not the company that people,

40:17.380 --> 40:18.860
 oh my God, the iPhone came out.

40:18.860 --> 40:20.620
 It's a very different level of confidence

40:20.620 --> 40:24.300
 and financial situation that the company was in

40:24.300 --> 40:25.540
 versus the iPod.

40:25.540 --> 40:27.580
 So given that, what was the conversation

40:27.580 --> 40:29.420
 when you finally presented to Steve?

40:29.420 --> 40:33.180
 Steve, what was that conversation like?

40:34.260 --> 40:37.860
 The conversation was, well, we went through it,

40:37.860 --> 40:40.780
 the presentation and all that stuff happened.

40:40.780 --> 40:43.420
 And he was just like, and he never,

40:43.420 --> 40:45.500
 he would flip through it real quick,

40:45.500 --> 40:47.180
 throw the presentation aside and said,

40:47.180 --> 40:49.700
 okay, let's talk about this, right?

40:49.700 --> 40:51.340
 And so we went through it all.

40:51.340 --> 40:55.660
 And one was a big conversation about Sony.

40:55.660 --> 40:59.420
 And Sony was the number one in all audio categories,

40:59.420 --> 41:02.980
 home, portable, whatever, in the world, okay?

41:03.980 --> 41:06.420
 I had been already gone through 10 years of failure.

41:06.420 --> 41:07.260
 And I was like, wait a second,

41:07.260 --> 41:08.900
 how are we gonna compete with Sony?

41:10.340 --> 41:12.620
 And I was always worried that Sony

41:12.620 --> 41:14.180
 was gonna come out with whatever it was

41:14.180 --> 41:16.460
 that they were gonna come out with, their MP3 player.

41:16.460 --> 41:18.900
 And that was it, game over, right?

41:19.860 --> 41:22.260
 And so I was like, Steve,

41:22.260 --> 41:26.140
 Steve, and this is why it took me four weeks

41:26.140 --> 41:27.900
 to finally sign on to join Apple

41:27.900 --> 41:32.020
 after he green lighted the iPod program in that meeting,

41:32.020 --> 41:35.140
 was because I had built other things in the past

41:35.140 --> 41:36.740
 at Phillips, the Nino and Velo,

41:36.740 --> 41:38.780
 but they didn't know how to sell it or market it.

41:38.780 --> 41:41.340
 They didn't know how to retail it, right?

41:41.340 --> 41:42.820
 So I was like, we could build this.

41:42.820 --> 41:45.100
 And I was like, Steve, I'm pretty sure I can build this.

41:45.100 --> 41:48.980
 I've done this before, but how are we gonna sell it?

41:48.980 --> 41:52.820
 You have all your marketing dollars on the Mac.

41:52.820 --> 41:55.420
 And he looked at me and he goes, you build this

41:55.420 --> 41:57.460
 with, you know, a team and our team and Apple

41:57.460 --> 41:59.500
 and this and this and the me, right?

41:59.500 --> 42:02.940
 And I dedicate that we will make sure

42:02.940 --> 42:05.500
 that at least two quarters of all marketing dollars

42:05.500 --> 42:08.860
 will only go to this product and nothing else.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.260
 Wow.

42:10.260 --> 42:14.140
 Right, Mac was the lifeblood of all revenue of the company.

42:14.140 --> 42:16.980
 So Steve saw something special here.

42:16.980 --> 42:19.820
 Exactly, and he said, I'm going to commit

42:19.820 --> 42:21.620
 all the marketing dollars if you can deliver

42:21.620 --> 42:24.380
 the experience that we're all talking about,

42:24.380 --> 42:26.140
 if we can do that, and that was Jeff Robin as well,

42:26.140 --> 42:29.140
 because iPod would have never happened without iTunes.

42:29.140 --> 42:31.260
 You know, people don't understand that was a bundle.

42:31.260 --> 42:33.660
 You couldn't do one without the other and vice versa.

42:33.660 --> 42:36.740
 So Jeff and I were, you know, if Jeff and you can present

42:36.740 --> 42:40.780
 and bring that experience to life,

42:40.780 --> 42:42.620
 I will put all the marketing dollars behind it.

42:42.620 --> 42:47.140
 When did the marriage of iPod and iTunes sort of,

42:48.340 --> 42:53.220
 what was that birth of ideas that made up iTunes?

42:53.220 --> 42:56.220
 iTunes existed before the iPod, okay?

42:56.220 --> 42:58.540
 And so Jeff Robin had his company,

42:58.540 --> 43:00.820
 oh man, I can't remember the name, but it was bought.

43:00.820 --> 43:04.500
 He was making a MP3 player app for the Mac.

43:05.780 --> 43:08.180
 Steve saw it because there was MP3 player apps

43:08.180 --> 43:10.580
 like Winamp and other things that were on the PC,

43:10.580 --> 43:13.900
 real player, and Steve saw that going on

43:13.900 --> 43:17.820
 and saw that Jeff and his small team had this,

43:17.820 --> 43:19.740
 I can't remember, sound something.

43:19.740 --> 43:22.980
 Anyways, he bought that and that became the basis of iTunes

43:22.980 --> 43:24.860
 and then Jeff ran all of iTunes.

43:24.860 --> 43:27.900
 And so what happened specifically there was

43:27.900 --> 43:28.900
 they were starting to hook up

43:28.900 --> 43:31.340
 to all these third party MP3 players

43:31.340 --> 43:34.580
 because there's a lot of Korean, the MP man,

43:34.580 --> 43:36.780
 like Walkman, but MP man, all these,

43:36.780 --> 43:38.300
 and they were trying to hook them up

43:38.300 --> 43:41.180
 and they were like, these are horrible experiences.

43:41.180 --> 43:43.420
 And through that, and they said,

43:43.420 --> 43:46.580
 iTunes was something that was gonna help grow the Mac base

43:46.580 --> 43:49.420
 because we were trying to get more on the Mac.

43:49.420 --> 43:51.580
 So this program would be a great new thing

43:51.580 --> 43:53.060
 you could add to the Mac.

43:53.060 --> 43:55.020
 And there was also internet connectivity at the time

43:55.020 --> 43:56.020
 for the iMac.

43:56.020 --> 43:57.740
 And so they did that

43:57.740 --> 44:00.140
 and then they're trying to do these hookups.

44:00.140 --> 44:01.300
 They weren't going well.

44:01.300 --> 44:04.540
 And that's when they said, we need to build our own.

44:04.540 --> 44:06.180
 Or Steve said, we need to build our own

44:06.180 --> 44:08.020
 since these are such horrible experiences.

44:08.020 --> 44:10.660
 People don't wanna just burn CDs from iTunes.

44:10.660 --> 44:12.940
 We need to get that music on the go,

44:12.940 --> 44:14.420
 but in an Apple fashion.

44:14.420 --> 44:18.420
 That's when I was called to come in to do that,

44:18.420 --> 44:20.900
 the iPod thing after the six weeks.

44:20.900 --> 44:24.300
 Then he already envisioned, I'm sure he had it envisioned

44:24.300 --> 44:26.740
 because they were trying to do this thing.

44:26.740 --> 44:28.380
 Okay, now that's it.

44:28.380 --> 44:32.500
 iTunes, it wasn't called iPod yet.

44:32.500 --> 44:33.820
 What would become the iPod?

44:33.820 --> 44:36.580
 That is gonna be the thing that then propels Apple

44:36.580 --> 44:37.420
 into this new thing

44:37.420 --> 44:39.740
 because you're gonna bring all these music lovers in

44:39.740 --> 44:43.740
 that are gonna need their next generation

44:43.740 --> 44:46.900
 or Sony Walkman version 2.0.

44:46.900 --> 44:51.740
 So when you look at, again, apologies to linger on iPod,

44:51.740 --> 44:56.560
 but it's one of the great inventions in tech history.

44:58.220 --> 45:00.800
 What wisdom do you draw from that whole process

45:00.800 --> 45:03.660
 about spotting an idea?

45:03.660 --> 45:07.540
 This is something you talk about in your book, Build.

45:09.100 --> 45:11.480
 How do you know that an idea is brilliant?

45:11.480 --> 45:12.780
 At which stage?

45:12.780 --> 45:14.640
 When did you know it was a good idea?

45:16.260 --> 45:21.260
 And maybe is there like some phase shifts?

45:22.020 --> 45:25.140
 First you complete out, then maybe,

45:25.140 --> 45:27.140
 and then maybe it becomes more than a hmm

45:27.140 --> 45:29.020
 and becomes like a little more confidence,

45:29.020 --> 45:29.920
 that kind of stuff.

45:29.920 --> 45:34.020
 And also wisdom about who to talk to

45:35.660 --> 45:37.900
 so they don't trample the idea in their early stages,

45:37.900 --> 45:39.020
 that kind of stuff.

45:39.020 --> 45:40.260
 Any thoughts about this?

45:40.260 --> 45:41.580
 We could go on again.

45:41.580 --> 45:42.660
 How long do you wanna go?

45:42.660 --> 45:45.940
 20, this is a Netflix series, I told you.

45:45.940 --> 45:47.260
 Multi season.

45:47.260 --> 45:51.060
 So a lot of lessons learned over those years of failure

45:51.060 --> 45:55.860
 and success, but the first thing it starts with,

45:55.860 --> 45:58.700
 there's a whole chapter called Great Ideas Chase You.

45:58.700 --> 46:00.700
 And so it kind of goes into in Build

46:00.700 --> 46:03.060
 and it goes through kind of chapter and verse

46:03.060 --> 46:07.420
 about all of those, how Nest became into being.

46:07.420 --> 46:10.840
 But let's talk about it specifically for iPod, right?

46:10.840 --> 46:13.540
 So for me, I always had pain,

46:13.540 --> 46:16.660
 the pain of carrying these CDs everywhere, right?

46:16.660 --> 46:19.700
 And I had the joy of music, right?

46:19.700 --> 46:21.740
 If you could say, all of a sudden I could get

46:21.740 --> 46:25.800
 the music I love all the time in a portable package

46:25.800 --> 46:28.060
 and I can have all the music I love all the time,

46:28.060 --> 46:30.540
 I was solving a pain, which was,

46:30.540 --> 46:31.800
 for me it was thousands of CDs,

46:31.800 --> 46:34.940
 other people might be 10 or 15 CDs, right?

46:34.940 --> 46:38.860
 And then I can have the joy of all this music uninterrupted.

46:38.860 --> 46:43.180
 That was taking the pain, making a painkiller for it.

46:43.180 --> 46:45.340
 And then at the end was a superpower,

46:45.340 --> 46:47.100
 an emotional superpower that said,

46:47.100 --> 46:50.540
 oh my, this is something different.

46:50.540 --> 46:53.320
 So when you can actually focus on a pain,

46:53.320 --> 46:57.380
 not and get a painkiller for it, not a vitamin.

46:57.380 --> 46:58.780
 So the difference between a painkiller

46:58.780 --> 46:59.940
 and a vitamin is very clear.

46:59.940 --> 47:02.900
 One, you need, I gotta get rid of this pain.

47:02.900 --> 47:05.340
 A vitamin, maybe it works, maybe it doesn't,

47:05.340 --> 47:06.840
 maybe somebody needs it, maybe not,

47:06.840 --> 47:08.960
 it's all marketing story, right?

47:08.960 --> 47:11.580
 So you start with the pain, give them a painkiller,

47:11.580 --> 47:13.820
 and hopefully if you can do it in the right way,

47:13.820 --> 47:17.420
 you give them a superpower, an emotional superpower.

47:17.420 --> 47:21.580
 That is always, and that's the way to know

47:21.580 --> 47:23.740
 that you're hitting on something that's really powerful.

47:23.740 --> 47:28.740
 The pain and the joy, are you always aware of the pain?

47:31.360 --> 47:34.300
 So it seems like a lot of great products,

47:34.300 --> 47:36.340
 it's like we do a lot of painful things

47:36.340 --> 47:40.460
 and we just kind of assume that's the way it's supposed

47:40.460 --> 47:42.620
 to be, like with autonomous vehicles,

47:42.620 --> 47:45.260
 we'll all assume we're supposed to be driving.

47:46.620 --> 47:50.500
 And it doesn't, you don't think of it as a pain.

47:50.500 --> 47:54.100
 Right, well, you've habituated it away.

47:54.100 --> 47:55.100
 You've habituated it away.

47:55.100 --> 47:58.820
 For me, when I go to other places,

47:58.820 --> 48:01.020
 living in Bali or living in Paris or whatever,

48:01.020 --> 48:05.060
 and I'm not driving, I'm walking or I'm using a scooter

48:05.060 --> 48:06.780
 or what have you, different thing,

48:06.780 --> 48:10.200
 and you go, oh my God, when you left that environment,

48:10.200 --> 48:12.300
 because everyone else is driving all the time,

48:12.300 --> 48:13.540
 you're like, that's what you do.

48:13.540 --> 48:15.580
 And you find out there's other ways of living

48:15.580 --> 48:17.540
 and there's freedom when you get rid of that,

48:17.540 --> 48:20.580
 you're like, oh my God, I didn't know

48:20.580 --> 48:21.740
 that this was so much better.

48:21.740 --> 48:24.700
 So there's something in the book that's called out

48:24.700 --> 48:27.460
 and I deemed it the virus of doubt.

48:27.460 --> 48:30.980
 And what the virus of doubt is, is when there's pain

48:30.980 --> 48:33.200
 and it's been habituated away,

48:33.200 --> 48:35.860
 you use the right marketing messages

48:35.860 --> 48:39.460
 to bring people back to that initial experience they had

48:39.460 --> 48:42.200
 or the initial experience that they had of that pain.

48:42.200 --> 48:45.540
 Do you remember when the first time you did blah

48:45.540 --> 48:48.940
 and it felt like this, right?

48:48.940 --> 48:53.340
 And then you reawaken that habituated pain

48:54.500 --> 48:56.980
 and people, and it becomes visceral

48:56.980 --> 49:01.140
 and then they're like, oh, yes, I hate that.

49:01.140 --> 49:04.020
 And then you go, now I have the painkiller

49:04.020 --> 49:05.780
 and the joy for you.

49:05.780 --> 49:08.020
 That's when it all comes together and it goes.

49:10.560 --> 49:12.700
 Let me, on this, on the pain and the joy

49:12.700 --> 49:17.700
 that's brilliantly put, you mentioned selling

49:17.740 --> 49:19.700
 and marketing, right?

49:19.700 --> 49:21.180
 Marketing dollars.

49:22.860 --> 49:25.220
 I have a love, hate relationship with marketing,

49:26.940 --> 49:30.900
 like with a lot of things that require artistic genius.

49:30.900 --> 49:34.060
 To me, the best marketing, I suppose,

49:34.060 --> 49:37.420
 is the product itself and then word of mouth.

49:37.420 --> 49:40.380
 So like create a thing that people love.

49:40.380 --> 49:41.900
 Oh, absolutely, that's fundamental.

49:41.900 --> 49:46.540
 Yeah, so any other marketing requires genius

49:46.540 --> 49:48.460
 to be any extra thing.

49:48.460 --> 49:53.460
 Because to me, I don't, yeah, maybe you can,

49:54.620 --> 49:59.340
 by way of question, I'm just speaking off the top

49:59.340 --> 50:03.660
 of my head as a consumer, what is great marketing?

50:03.660 --> 50:07.100
 What does it take to reveal the pain

50:07.100 --> 50:08.260
 and the joy of a thing?

50:08.260 --> 50:09.460
 Okay.

50:09.460 --> 50:11.820
 It all starts at the beginning.

50:11.820 --> 50:13.780
 And let me give you, I'm gonna give you a couple

50:13.780 --> 50:15.860
 of different ways of looking at it, okay?

50:15.860 --> 50:18.460
 And again, we might go a little long here.

50:18.460 --> 50:22.220
 So just stay tuned in.

50:22.220 --> 50:23.060
 So the first thing is.

50:23.060 --> 50:23.900
 Start at the beginning.

50:23.900 --> 50:26.020
 Let's start at the beginning.

50:26.020 --> 50:29.340
 In the early part of my career, like General Magic

50:29.340 --> 50:31.160
 and Philips and what have you,

50:33.580 --> 50:36.380
 and especially when I was a teenager,

50:36.380 --> 50:39.900
 when I was making my own chips and stuff like that,

50:39.900 --> 50:44.100
 I really worried about just putting cool things together.

50:44.100 --> 50:46.540
 I'm like that, when I put those two cool things together

50:46.540 --> 50:48.860
 as an engineer, you go, that's cool.

50:48.860 --> 50:50.460
 And then I would talk to the other friends

50:50.460 --> 50:53.260
 who might be geeks too, and they go, yeah, that's cool.

50:54.180 --> 50:57.020
 Because we knew the bits, so we put them together

50:57.020 --> 50:58.220
 and that's a new way of doing it.

50:58.220 --> 51:02.820
 And you're like, wow, that's all what?

51:02.820 --> 51:03.940
 It's not why?

51:04.840 --> 51:06.340
 Why are you doing this?

51:06.340 --> 51:08.300
 We know what we're doing, but we don't know

51:08.300 --> 51:10.340
 why we're doing it, because we're not articulating it

51:10.340 --> 51:12.180
 for ourselves, because it's just something

51:12.180 --> 51:14.140
 we're like putting it together and like, yeah, that's cool

51:14.140 --> 51:17.900
 because we think we're solving some problem we have,

51:17.900 --> 51:19.700
 but we're not really articulating it.

51:19.700 --> 51:21.820
 So what normally happens, and this happens

51:21.820 --> 51:24.940
 because we invest in so many companies around the world,

51:24.940 --> 51:26.980
 you have these brilliant engineers, designers,

51:26.980 --> 51:31.560
 scientists, researchers, they put together these what's.

51:32.620 --> 51:35.780
 And then they develop it, develop it, develop it.

51:35.780 --> 51:38.180
 And then at the end, they call in marketing

51:38.180 --> 51:40.660
 and say, now tell a story about this

51:40.660 --> 51:42.920
 and let's get it out to the world, okay?

51:43.940 --> 51:46.380
 What happens then is marketing is like,

51:46.380 --> 51:48.300
 well, why do people need this?

51:48.300 --> 51:50.180
 Tell us why people need it.

51:50.180 --> 51:53.560
 And so they create a story around this product,

51:54.440 --> 51:56.940
 but the product was born out of what's, not why's.

51:57.780 --> 52:00.700
 And so they start telling, marketing starts telling a story

52:00.700 --> 52:03.500
 and it turns out to be a fictional story usually.

52:03.500 --> 52:06.200
 They say, oh, this is going to do these things.

52:06.200 --> 52:07.940
 The product comes in as delivered.

52:07.940 --> 52:10.100
 And it falls flat on its face

52:10.100 --> 52:12.940
 because the marketing doesn't match the product

52:12.940 --> 52:14.500
 because they weren't both created

52:14.500 --> 52:17.940
 at the beginning together, right?

52:17.940 --> 52:19.700
 There are what's when you create a product,

52:19.700 --> 52:21.380
 but there's a lot more why's

52:21.380 --> 52:23.700
 and the why's help inform the what's.

52:23.700 --> 52:27.020
 And the why's also inform the marketing.

52:27.020 --> 52:31.020
 So that's what you mean deeply

52:31.020 --> 52:32.620
 at we should start at the beginning.

52:32.620 --> 52:35.580
 So the designer should be also the marketer.

52:35.580 --> 52:37.940
 The engineer should be the marketer.

52:37.940 --> 52:38.780
 Exactly.

52:38.780 --> 52:40.540
 Stop impressing the geek next to you.

52:40.540 --> 52:42.540
 What is the superpower you're bringing

52:42.540 --> 52:47.540
 or the pain you're killing for the end customer, right?

52:48.020 --> 52:49.920
 Now let's contrast that.

52:51.540 --> 52:53.020
 Think about a movie.

52:53.020 --> 52:54.860
 A movie starts with a treatment.

52:54.860 --> 52:55.940
 It has an audience.

52:55.940 --> 52:56.820
 This has the audience.

52:56.820 --> 52:57.700
 Here's the characters.

52:57.700 --> 52:59.160
 Here's the storyline, the plot.

52:59.160 --> 53:02.660
 Here's the arc of the story, right?

53:02.660 --> 53:04.580
 It pulls that all out.

53:04.580 --> 53:07.180
 Then there's a script that's written.

53:07.180 --> 53:09.520
 And that script is then produced.

53:09.520 --> 53:11.060
 And then you add all the flourishes

53:11.060 --> 53:13.100
 and what have you music and graphics

53:13.100 --> 53:14.700
 and what have you, right?

53:14.700 --> 53:15.820
 And then it comes out

53:15.820 --> 53:17.260
 and then there's the marketing of the movie.

53:17.260 --> 53:19.680
 And that story was created at the beginning.

53:19.680 --> 53:22.780
 What you need to do if you're gonna do a great product

53:22.780 --> 53:24.940
 is create that treatment for your product.

53:24.940 --> 53:26.980
 And I call that the press release.

53:26.980 --> 53:30.500
 Do the press release like the treatment.

53:30.500 --> 53:31.620
 Who's the audience?

53:31.620 --> 53:33.260
 What features do you have?

53:33.260 --> 53:35.100
 What pains are you solving for people?

53:35.100 --> 53:37.820
 Have the virus of doubt there to remind them

53:37.820 --> 53:40.060
 what pains they have and why you're solving them.

53:40.060 --> 53:41.820
 The price, all of those things.

53:41.820 --> 53:46.660
 And you use that as the bar, the measuring stick

53:46.660 --> 53:48.540
 for what you do during development.

53:48.540 --> 53:51.780
 Because what happens that along the route, you know this.

53:52.620 --> 53:53.460
 Oh, we're not gonna be able

53:53.460 --> 53:55.420
 to get that feature done on time.

53:55.420 --> 53:56.380
 Throw that one overboard.

53:56.380 --> 53:58.540
 We gotta hit the, we have to hit the date.

53:58.540 --> 54:01.020
 Oh, we're not sure this product's right yet.

54:01.020 --> 54:02.620
 Add another feature.

54:02.620 --> 54:05.340
 Add another feature creep, right?

54:05.340 --> 54:06.500
 If you don't have that story

54:06.500 --> 54:08.500
 you know you're gonna tell at the beginning,

54:08.500 --> 54:11.300
 you don't have that bar, right?

54:11.300 --> 54:13.740
 And then at the end, you don't know when you're done

54:13.740 --> 54:14.560
 if you don't have that story.

54:14.560 --> 54:16.940
 So you can actually look at that press release.

54:16.940 --> 54:21.900
 You know, you change it over time, that draft.

54:21.900 --> 54:24.880
 But then when you're done, you know the what's and the whys.

54:24.880 --> 54:26.900
 You have all the things, the audience and everything.

54:26.900 --> 54:29.500
 And then you can give that to marketing and say,

54:29.500 --> 54:32.100
 well, and marketing has been along the way, let's be clear.

54:32.100 --> 54:33.900
 But then everybody's in sync.

54:33.900 --> 54:35.580
 And that's when you can tell a cohesive,

54:35.580 --> 54:37.700
 non fictional story about,

54:37.700 --> 54:39.600
 and the product delivers on that story

54:39.600 --> 54:41.980
 or hopefully over delivers on that story.

54:41.980 --> 54:45.860
 So in the drafting from the beginning

54:45.860 --> 54:47.760
 to the end of the press release,

54:47.760 --> 54:49.860
 what does a successful team look like?

54:49.860 --> 54:51.500
 Who's part of the draft?

54:51.500 --> 54:53.560
 Is it engineers, designers?

54:53.560 --> 54:56.760
 What's the purpose of a marketing department

54:56.760 --> 54:59.800
 in a company, small, let's say small company,

54:59.800 --> 55:02.460
 but more than two people?

55:02.460 --> 55:06.900
 So from where does the why come from?

55:06.900 --> 55:08.820
 Should it always come from the designer

55:08.820 --> 55:10.580
 or should there be a marketing person

55:10.580 --> 55:13.660
 that yeah, steps in and ask the question.

55:13.660 --> 55:16.180
 So I'll just keep asking random questions.

55:16.180 --> 55:18.060
 No, these are great questions.

55:18.060 --> 55:20.100
 So, cause you're just like, I'm like,

55:20.100 --> 55:22.220
 I can't wait to tell you the answer.

55:22.220 --> 55:23.780
 So it's in the book as well,

55:23.780 --> 55:25.780
 but you have to separate out

55:25.780 --> 55:27.780
 the various functions of marketing.

55:27.780 --> 55:30.860
 That's what I thought, I was like,

55:30.860 --> 55:34.420
 marketing's marketing, and it's really not.

55:34.420 --> 55:35.620
 There's so many disciplines,

55:35.620 --> 55:38.660
 just like in engineering, mechanical, electrical, software,

55:38.660 --> 55:41.700
 and even software, it's cloud services,

55:41.700 --> 55:43.700
 firmware applications,

55:43.700 --> 55:46.620
 marketing has that much diversity as well.

55:46.620 --> 55:48.900
 Okay, and you have to honor that.

55:48.900 --> 55:53.900
 And so there is marketing communications like PR, press,

55:53.900 --> 55:57.140
 there is social marketing,

55:57.140 --> 56:00.220
 there is a marketing creative, right?

56:00.220 --> 56:01.900
 There's marketing activation,

56:03.300 --> 56:05.740
 but there's another thing that also comes out

56:05.740 --> 56:09.700
 and people confuse it with marketing,

56:09.700 --> 56:13.460
 which is called product marketing or product management.

56:13.460 --> 56:15.820
 And product management or product marketing

56:15.820 --> 56:17.380
 is the voice of the customer.

56:18.780 --> 56:21.860
 They're the person who sits there and listens

56:21.860 --> 56:25.500
 to what's going on in the competition, in the marketplace,

56:25.500 --> 56:28.580
 understanding the needs and those pains of the customer,

56:28.580 --> 56:31.700
 and they're representing them in every single meeting

56:31.700 --> 56:34.900
 so things don't get off track, right?

56:34.900 --> 56:38.380
 So that, and they're creating the messages,

56:38.380 --> 56:39.380
 not the marketing.

56:39.380 --> 56:40.740
 What happens is there's messages

56:40.740 --> 56:41.940
 that product marketing creates,

56:41.940 --> 56:43.340
 like those are the deep messages,

56:43.340 --> 56:48.140
 like we need to save 20% of energy, let's say, right?

56:48.140 --> 56:50.260
 And then marketing turns that into something

56:50.260 --> 56:52.460
 that's with creative and everything

56:52.460 --> 56:53.660
 and brings that message across.

56:53.660 --> 56:54.540
 Maybe it doesn't say that,

56:54.540 --> 56:57.580
 but it comes maybe visually or some other way.

56:57.580 --> 56:59.940
 So product management does that

56:59.940 --> 57:04.940
 and holds that press release along the route

57:04.940 --> 57:07.100
 and making sure that we're tracking.

57:07.100 --> 57:09.620
 And then also marketing is tracking with that press release

57:09.620 --> 57:12.180
 to make sure they're not telling a fictional story, right?

57:12.180 --> 57:15.340
 Because they can also add extra adjectives or something,

57:15.340 --> 57:16.820
 and then the product can't deliver that.

57:16.820 --> 57:18.180
 It's like, no, no, no, no, no.

57:18.180 --> 57:19.020
 Keeps everybody in check.

57:19.020 --> 57:22.060
 It has to be grounded to the press release, to the raws.

57:22.060 --> 57:24.020
 Right, to the customer needs, right?

57:24.020 --> 57:25.900
 Cause they're always representing the customer.

57:25.900 --> 57:28.660
 So you have to have a product manager.

57:28.660 --> 57:30.980
 Typically that's the founder, right?

57:30.980 --> 57:32.180
 In the beginning.

57:32.180 --> 57:36.420
 And then over time you hire a product management team

57:36.420 --> 57:40.180
 to then really watch over this the whole way.

57:40.180 --> 57:42.660
 And they are talking to customer support.

57:42.660 --> 57:45.100
 They're talking to engineering, they're talking to design,

57:45.100 --> 57:47.580
 they're talking to sales and marketing.

57:47.580 --> 57:50.540
 And they are always in the mix.

57:50.540 --> 57:52.540
 And it's the hardest thing to hire for.

57:52.540 --> 57:53.460
 Ooh, yeah.

57:53.460 --> 57:55.620
 So they have this very important job

57:55.620 --> 57:58.940
 of developing and maintaining the why.

57:58.940 --> 57:59.820
 Exactly.

57:59.820 --> 58:01.660
 Why is it the hardest to hire for?

58:01.660 --> 58:03.540
 Because you have to understand,

58:03.540 --> 58:05.120
 first, nobody reports to you.

58:06.500 --> 58:07.340
 You're alone.

58:07.340 --> 58:10.540
 So you're alone and you have to build great ties

58:10.540 --> 58:13.740
 with all of these different functions.

58:13.740 --> 58:15.900
 You have to understand what they do,

58:15.900 --> 58:17.700
 be empathetic with what they do.

58:17.700 --> 58:21.980
 And you have to project the customer's empathy

58:21.980 --> 58:25.340
 or empathy for the customer to them and tell them why

58:25.340 --> 58:28.740
 and why this customer needs this, why this doesn't work.

58:28.740 --> 58:30.260
 And so that they learn more.

58:30.260 --> 58:31.100
 They're not just doing,

58:31.100 --> 58:33.860
 but they learn about the customer's point of view

58:33.860 --> 58:36.340
 and sit in there and stand in their shoes

58:36.340 --> 58:38.140
 to be able to then make better decisions

58:38.140 --> 58:41.120
 on the engineering details or the operational details,

58:41.120 --> 58:42.580
 customer support details.

58:42.580 --> 58:47.260
 So they understand that if they're not the customer

58:47.260 --> 58:48.460
 that it's intended for,

58:48.460 --> 58:51.580
 they start to live through their eyes

58:51.580 --> 58:53.780
 and see through their eyes of that customer

58:53.780 --> 58:55.100
 so they make better decisions.

58:55.100 --> 58:59.460
 And there's probably fascinating, beautiful tensions

58:59.460 --> 59:03.500
 between that and sort of the engineers.

59:03.500 --> 59:04.540
 Oh, that's cool.

59:04.540 --> 59:08.180
 Sort of the developing the what.

59:08.180 --> 59:09.220
 Exactly.

59:09.220 --> 59:11.860
 Which makes it an extra hard job, I'm sure.

59:11.860 --> 59:12.700
 Exactly.

59:12.700 --> 59:15.100
 Can I ask a sort of a little bit of a personal question

59:15.100 --> 59:17.780
 on the one subfield of marketing you mentioned,

59:17.780 --> 59:18.960
 comms and PR.

59:22.700 --> 59:23.540
 How do I ask this?

59:23.540 --> 59:26.160
 I can hear your struggle in your sigh.

59:27.900 --> 59:32.900
 Why or do the comms and PR folks sometimes

59:36.420 --> 59:40.840
 kill the heart and soul of the magic

59:40.840 --> 59:45.100
 that makes a company or is that wrong to say?

59:45.100 --> 59:46.700
 Give me an example.

59:46.700 --> 59:48.980
 I will say the spirit of the example,

59:48.980 --> 59:53.980
 which is it feels like often the jobs of communications

59:55.860 --> 59:57.620
 is to provide caution.

59:58.940 --> 1:00:01.300
 It almost works together with legal to say.

1:00:01.300 --> 1:00:02.140
 A shield.

1:00:02.140 --> 1:00:06.520
 Yeah, we probably should not say this.

1:00:06.520 --> 1:00:09.180
 Let's be careful, let's be careful.

1:00:09.180 --> 1:00:14.180
 Now, that makes sense except in this modern world,

1:00:15.900 --> 1:00:20.900
 authenticity is extremely valuable

1:00:20.900 --> 1:00:24.980
 and revealing the beauty that is in the engineering,

1:00:24.980 --> 1:00:29.920
 the beauty of the ideas, the chaos of the ideas,

1:00:29.920 --> 1:00:34.700
 I think requires throwing caution to the wind to some degree.

1:00:34.700 --> 1:00:35.540
 I agree.

1:00:35.540 --> 1:00:40.540
 And I just find that, boy, to push back on myself,

1:00:43.020 --> 1:00:45.420
 I think it's an extremely difficult job

1:00:45.420 --> 1:00:47.500
 because people hold you responsible

1:00:47.500 --> 1:00:51.520
 if you're doing communications when you take risks.

1:00:53.300 --> 1:00:54.820
 And especially when they fail.

1:00:54.820 --> 1:00:57.540
 So it's a difficult job,

1:00:57.540 --> 1:00:59.580
 so I understand why people become cautious,

1:00:59.580 --> 1:01:03.540
 but to me, communications is about taking big risks

1:01:03.540 --> 1:01:06.100
 and throwing caution to the wind at its best

1:01:06.100 --> 1:01:11.100
 because your job is to communicate in the long term,

1:01:12.500 --> 1:01:16.040
 communicate the genius, the joy,

1:01:17.540 --> 1:01:19.740
 the genius of the product.

1:01:19.740 --> 1:01:23.160
 And that sometimes is a tension with caution.

1:01:23.160 --> 1:01:26.420
 Sorry, so because I've gotten the chance

1:01:26.420 --> 1:01:28.620
 to meet a lot of very interesting people

1:01:28.620 --> 1:01:31.300
 and interesting engineering teams and so on,

1:01:31.300 --> 1:01:33.340
 I look at what they're doing

1:01:33.340 --> 1:01:35.780
 and I look at what's being communicated

1:01:35.780 --> 1:01:37.660
 and it's just, there's a mismatch

1:01:37.660 --> 1:01:40.100
 because the communication is a lot more boring.

1:01:40.100 --> 1:01:44.100
 It's like, there's something very like,

1:01:44.100 --> 1:01:45.900
 just straight up boring

1:01:45.900 --> 1:01:49.780
 about the way they're communicating because of caution.

1:01:49.780 --> 1:01:54.700
 Okay, you have just teed me up for another diatribe, okay?

1:01:54.700 --> 1:01:58.100
 I'm gonna get on my podium here.

1:01:58.100 --> 1:01:58.940
 Yes, please.

1:01:58.940 --> 1:02:02.920
 Yeah, it all comes out of the leader.

1:02:04.380 --> 1:02:06.380
 If the leader doesn't know how to storytell

1:02:06.380 --> 1:02:09.740
 or the leader doesn't know how to do bold storytelling,

1:02:09.740 --> 1:02:14.300
 then you get even more conservatism

1:02:14.300 --> 1:02:17.340
 from the PR and communications folks

1:02:17.340 --> 1:02:18.300
 because they're always,

1:02:18.300 --> 1:02:21.500
 so if you have a, not a bold leader,

1:02:21.500 --> 1:02:23.860
 they're always going to be a filter, right?

1:02:23.860 --> 1:02:25.860
 They're always gonna try to smooth things out

1:02:25.860 --> 1:02:27.620
 and take off the rough edges and try,

1:02:27.620 --> 1:02:28.700
 so they're gonna be even more,

1:02:28.700 --> 1:02:31.500
 if you have a conservative messaging leader,

1:02:31.500 --> 1:02:32.580
 you're gonna have an even more

1:02:32.580 --> 1:02:35.260
 conservative communications department.

1:02:35.260 --> 1:02:36.100
 Why?

1:02:36.100 --> 1:02:37.740
 Because they wanna keep their jobs.

1:02:37.740 --> 1:02:40.100
 Okay, it's really simple.

1:02:40.100 --> 1:02:41.020
 They gotta keep their jobs.

1:02:41.020 --> 1:02:44.420
 If they say one wrong thing, it could be the end of it.

1:02:44.420 --> 1:02:46.760
 So if you have very conservative leader,

1:02:46.760 --> 1:02:48.920
 they're going to be even more conservative.

1:02:48.920 --> 1:02:50.380
 If you have a bold leader,

1:02:50.380 --> 1:02:54.240
 they'll always take a little more conservative bent,

1:02:54.240 --> 1:02:56.420
 but you're still gonna have bold communications.

1:02:56.420 --> 1:02:57.660
 Yeah, that's brilliant.

1:02:57.660 --> 1:03:00.180
 Okay, so it starts with the leader.

1:03:00.180 --> 1:03:02.420
 Now, that said,

1:03:03.660 --> 1:03:08.060
 when you think about the messages

1:03:08.060 --> 1:03:11.240
 and the joy and revealing things, right?

1:03:13.940 --> 1:03:18.560
 Many of these leaders don't tell great stories.

1:03:18.560 --> 1:03:22.340
 So what we do at FutureShape, our investment firm,

1:03:22.340 --> 1:03:24.320
 is we take those scientists all of,

1:03:24.320 --> 1:03:25.780
 and the great minds and everything,

1:03:25.780 --> 1:03:28.220
 and what do we surround them with?

1:03:28.220 --> 1:03:30.260
 Marketing and communication people

1:03:30.260 --> 1:03:33.940
 and storytellers to give them the confidence

1:03:33.940 --> 1:03:36.020
 to tell a much broader story

1:03:36.900 --> 1:03:39.100
 about the impacts of what they're creating

1:03:39.100 --> 1:03:42.260
 and how big the global change can be

1:03:42.260 --> 1:03:43.700
 with those technologies.

1:03:43.700 --> 1:03:45.340
 Because usually they don't,

1:03:45.340 --> 1:03:47.640
 those leaders who created those technologies,

1:03:47.640 --> 1:03:49.500
 they don't really know how to communicate really well

1:03:49.500 --> 1:03:52.760
 and they don't feel very comfortable in how they speak.

1:03:52.760 --> 1:03:54.380
 Yeah, so it's interesting

1:03:54.380 --> 1:03:57.820
 because stories, I'm a huge fan of stories.

1:03:57.820 --> 1:03:59.620
 Have you ever read the book, Story?

1:03:59.620 --> 1:04:00.460
 No.

1:04:00.460 --> 1:04:01.280
 By Robert McKee?

1:04:01.280 --> 1:04:02.120
 Mm hmm.

1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:02.940
 You should read this.

1:04:02.940 --> 1:04:04.540
 And this is what I read when I was 26.

1:04:05.940 --> 1:04:07.660
 Story by Robert McKee,

1:04:07.660 --> 1:04:12.460
 and it's a book all about the ways to do script writing,

1:04:12.460 --> 1:04:16.660
 the prototypical types of scripts, drama, comedy,

1:04:16.660 --> 1:04:20.540
 and how it's been shown over millennia,

1:04:20.540 --> 1:04:21.700
 how these stories are done.

1:04:21.700 --> 1:04:23.620
 It's a fascinating thing

1:04:23.620 --> 1:04:26.020
 and it gives you an insight to,

1:04:26.020 --> 1:04:28.700
 and it's written for obviously Hollywood

1:04:28.700 --> 1:04:30.600
 and movies and things like that,

1:04:30.600 --> 1:04:33.880
 but it's incredibly useful for what we do

1:04:33.880 --> 1:04:37.940
 as designers and engineers and technology leaders.

1:04:37.940 --> 1:04:40.260
 There's some aspect in this modern day

1:04:40.260 --> 1:04:42.620
 where this podcast and so on,

1:04:44.340 --> 1:04:47.260
 what I love is the humans behind the story too.

1:04:47.260 --> 1:04:49.560
 So some part of the story is the human beings.

1:04:49.560 --> 1:04:54.380
 So humor, drama,

1:04:55.640 --> 1:04:57.360
 heartbreak, hope.

1:04:57.360 --> 1:04:58.200
 Emotions.

1:04:58.200 --> 1:04:59.540
 Emotions.

1:04:59.540 --> 1:05:03.080
 That's not just about painting a beautiful story

1:05:03.080 --> 1:05:05.720
 that's flawless, it's...

1:05:05.720 --> 1:05:06.620
 Vulnerability.

1:05:06.620 --> 1:05:07.460
 Yep.

1:05:07.460 --> 1:05:11.600
 It's being a dreamer, like overpromising,

1:05:11.600 --> 1:05:16.240
 and then failing, so changing your mind,

1:05:16.240 --> 1:05:18.520
 realizing sort of just the whole of it.

1:05:18.520 --> 1:05:20.600
 And then also being like,

1:05:20.600 --> 1:05:22.960
 depending of course where your personality is,

1:05:23.920 --> 1:05:26.800
 embracing the full richness and the complexity

1:05:26.800 --> 1:05:28.600
 of the personality of the leader

1:05:28.600 --> 1:05:30.300
 or the different people involved.

1:05:30.300 --> 1:05:31.800
 I mean, that's all part of it.

1:05:31.800 --> 1:05:34.740
 Like you can't just present this beautiful,

1:05:34.740 --> 1:05:37.840
 always pleasant view of a product.

1:05:37.840 --> 1:05:42.840
 There has to be this humanity that's part of it,

1:05:43.440 --> 1:05:45.940
 the full roller coaster of the humanity,

1:05:45.940 --> 1:05:49.120
 which I think has been very difficult for companies

1:05:49.120 --> 1:05:52.440
 to embrace, I'm not sure why.

1:05:52.440 --> 1:05:54.760
 Maybe it's just an old school way of doing things

1:05:54.760 --> 1:05:57.680
 that people think that we present a facade

1:05:59.280 --> 1:06:02.880
 and we generate the story and we tell the story

1:06:02.880 --> 1:06:04.740
 as opposed to sort of...

1:06:04.740 --> 1:06:07.520
 Well, we learn, especially in the technical world,

1:06:07.520 --> 1:06:11.320
 we present the story as it's faster, it's smaller,

1:06:11.320 --> 1:06:14.600
 it's longer battery life, it's bits and numbers

1:06:14.600 --> 1:06:19.600
 and metrics, that resonates sure with other geeks.

1:06:22.360 --> 1:06:26.720
 What resonates with the planet?

1:06:26.720 --> 1:06:28.520
 It's all emotions, right?

1:06:28.520 --> 1:06:31.200
 And if you can bring a great emotional story,

1:06:31.200 --> 1:06:33.800
 but with a great rational story at the same time,

1:06:33.800 --> 1:06:36.280
 why you should do this, and it's like,

1:06:36.280 --> 1:06:39.540
 oh my God, you bring that superpower, that joy,

1:06:39.540 --> 1:06:41.320
 then it all hangs.

1:06:41.320 --> 1:06:45.040
 And there's personal drama too, like the human.

1:06:45.040 --> 1:06:48.800
 Right, here's the pain I had, remember that thing.

1:06:48.800 --> 1:06:53.800
 And I mean, you're obviously this extremely well known

1:06:58.320 --> 1:07:02.440
 human being that's behind a lot of these great inventions

1:07:02.440 --> 1:07:04.320
 of the technology world, but you're also just

1:07:04.320 --> 1:07:09.320
 a human being, you have clearly a distinct personality

1:07:09.320 --> 1:07:11.800
 that comes through, like your eyes light up,

1:07:11.800 --> 1:07:13.800
 just the way you communicate, it's you.

1:07:15.960 --> 1:07:18.660
 Some people are more stoic, some people are,

1:07:18.660 --> 1:07:22.980
 like Elon is all over the place, the chaos.

1:07:24.120 --> 1:07:28.200
 Steve Jobs, I mean, it's hard to put into words,

1:07:28.200 --> 1:07:31.320
 I can be poetic and so on, but there's a very distinct,

1:07:31.320 --> 1:07:34.160
 comes on stage, you know, that personality is right there.

1:07:34.160 --> 1:07:37.600
 That's not just the product, that's something else too.

1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:40.160
 And like, you have to reveal that a little bit,

1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:43.160
 and allow people to reveal that a little bit,

1:07:43.160 --> 1:07:45.880
 and just let them be themselves.

1:07:45.880 --> 1:07:50.880
 Well, look, why do I think your podcast is so amazing?

1:07:51.240 --> 1:07:53.060
 Because you are yourself.

1:07:53.060 --> 1:07:55.600
 You talk about yourself, you bring your emotions into it,

1:07:55.600 --> 1:08:00.520
 and you don't modulate it, you're you, right?

1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:03.960
 It comes through, it's true, it feels right.

1:08:03.960 --> 1:08:07.520
 You are you, you dress the way you wanna dress,

1:08:07.520 --> 1:08:09.640
 you say this is me, and this is all of me,

1:08:09.640 --> 1:08:11.560
 and you become vulnerable, right?

1:08:11.560 --> 1:08:14.040
 It's much easier to do a podcast like that

1:08:14.040 --> 1:08:16.200
 than run a very large company,

1:08:16.200 --> 1:08:18.780
 where a lot of people would feel the pain if you make,

1:08:18.780 --> 1:08:20.800
 if you say something stupid.

1:08:20.800 --> 1:08:25.800
 So it's much more easy to be afraid and be careful.

1:08:27.400 --> 1:08:29.800
 But nevertheless, the same applies.

1:08:31.160 --> 1:08:36.160
 Authenticity and risk taking is the only way, unfortunately,

1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:39.520
 to be successful in the long term.

1:08:39.520 --> 1:08:42.960
 Let me, just because we're jumping all over the place,

1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:44.880
 just link on the iPod.

1:08:44.880 --> 1:08:49.240
 One of the great designs, broadly speaking,

1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:50.840
 in the word design of all time,

1:08:50.840 --> 1:08:53.720
 what does it take to design a great product?

1:08:53.720 --> 1:08:56.680
 If you look, we can jump around, we can look at Nest,

1:08:56.680 --> 1:08:59.640
 we can look at iPod, we can look at iPhone,

1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:02.600
 and many of the great things you design,

1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:07.600
 but just looking at that one transformational thing,

1:09:08.220 --> 1:09:13.220
 what can you say about what it takes to do a great design?

1:09:13.220 --> 1:09:15.220
 Or maybe what makes a great design?

1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:22.900
 Well, we talked about a painkiller,

1:09:22.900 --> 1:09:24.720
 and we talked about the,

1:09:24.720 --> 1:09:27.820
 we talked about that joy that comes from it.

1:09:28.920 --> 1:09:31.320
 But then there's the behind the scenes,

1:09:31.320 --> 1:09:35.280
 there's the team, there's everyone who brings it to life,

1:09:35.280 --> 1:09:36.840
 brings that story to life.

1:09:38.560 --> 1:09:41.840
 If you have a great story, and you know the why,

1:09:41.840 --> 1:09:43.440
 then you can communicate it

1:09:43.440 --> 1:09:45.840
 to those people who are working on it.

1:09:45.840 --> 1:09:49.040
 And then they bring their own thing into it, right?

1:09:49.040 --> 1:09:51.180
 It becomes emotional for them too.

1:09:51.180 --> 1:09:53.380
 It's not just a job, it's a mission.

1:09:54.440 --> 1:09:58.400
 And so many of the details that are born

1:09:58.400 --> 1:10:02.000
 out of these early prototypes,

1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:04.840
 these things that you still haven't given full form to,

1:10:04.840 --> 1:10:08.880
 there may be 80% done, or maybe even 60% done,

1:10:08.880 --> 1:10:10.720
 but you can see enough in there.

1:10:10.720 --> 1:10:12.720
 Then you take those great ideas,

1:10:12.720 --> 1:10:14.960
 and you give the whys to the team.

1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:18.520
 And so that they feel it, they can understand it,

1:10:18.520 --> 1:10:22.600
 then they bring their best and their ideas to the table,

1:10:22.600 --> 1:10:24.600
 and then you can select from those,

1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:27.680
 and you can then start to, you know,

1:10:27.680 --> 1:10:29.840
 it could be just a pixel change.

1:10:29.840 --> 1:10:32.380
 It could be a slight change on how you do the audio

1:10:32.380 --> 1:10:35.800
 for the feedback, or maybe a curve on the mechanics,

1:10:35.800 --> 1:10:38.160
 or something like that, of how it feels.

1:10:38.160 --> 1:10:39.880
 Because everybody brings themselves

1:10:39.880 --> 1:10:41.680
 trying to feel this thing.

1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:42.680
 They're not just doing something

1:10:42.680 --> 1:10:44.440
 that someone told them to do.

1:10:44.440 --> 1:10:48.160
 If you can instill that mission and that why into that team,

1:10:48.160 --> 1:10:52.480
 it doesn't have to be big, you get, I feel, a 10X.

1:10:52.480 --> 1:10:54.920
 Everyone comes together in a special way,

1:10:54.920 --> 1:10:58.720
 and the magic is created.

1:10:58.720 --> 1:11:00.660
 You put the love into it,

1:11:00.660 --> 1:11:02.640
 the customer feels the love on the other side.

1:11:02.640 --> 1:11:07.640
 So the, making the team,

1:11:08.160 --> 1:11:11.760
 like taking them in onto the vision, onto the why,

1:11:12.920 --> 1:11:16.160
 now they feel, all the little details we think of,

1:11:16.160 --> 1:11:21.160
 the original iPod, and all the many generations after,

1:11:21.160 --> 1:11:24.360
 all those little details are,

1:11:24.360 --> 1:11:27.640
 in them is the emotion of the engineers and the designers,

1:11:27.640 --> 1:11:32.640
 that working nights, struggling, this isn't right.

1:11:33.280 --> 1:11:36.080
 Like you said, changing little pixels here and there,

1:11:36.080 --> 1:11:41.080
 changing the shape of things, changing the feel of things,

1:11:41.480 --> 1:11:46.480
 like the materials, the, I don't know,

1:11:46.520 --> 1:11:48.640
 just everything on the software part of the packaging.

1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:51.480
 Then the words on the packaging.

1:11:51.480 --> 1:11:52.320
 Just everything.

1:11:52.320 --> 1:11:53.840
 The words on the website.

1:11:53.840 --> 1:11:57.200
 And always jumping from the very specific detail problem

1:11:57.200 --> 1:12:00.200
 to the big picture, how the thing feels, the overall.

1:12:00.200 --> 1:12:01.600
 Always jumping back and forth.

1:12:01.600 --> 1:12:02.920
 What does it look like to the customer?

1:12:02.920 --> 1:12:07.680
 How are we gonna implement it in the most efficient way?

1:12:07.680 --> 1:12:10.560
 Because a lot of the stuff you don't know is,

1:12:10.560 --> 1:12:13.600
 some of that stuff is hacked in, maybe hacked in at the end.

1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:17.040
 It may not be the most beautiful architecture

1:12:17.040 --> 1:12:18.480
 that a geek would look at and go, oh my God,

1:12:18.480 --> 1:12:20.760
 that's so beautiful, because we can look at it

1:12:20.760 --> 1:12:23.480
 and visualize this incredible software stack

1:12:23.480 --> 1:12:24.480
 or hardware stack.

1:12:24.480 --> 1:12:26.640
 Some of it could just be hacked in.

1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:28.240
 You make it better over time,

1:12:28.240 --> 1:12:30.560
 but it was that brilliant thing and we gotta get that in,

1:12:30.560 --> 1:12:32.240
 because that's the way you do it now,

1:12:32.240 --> 1:12:34.240
 and we'll make it more efficient later.

1:12:35.280 --> 1:12:38.560
 Maybe this is a good moment to draw a distinction

1:12:38.560 --> 1:12:40.200
 between design and engineering,

1:12:40.200 --> 1:12:42.460
 and does such a distinction even exist?

1:12:43.840 --> 1:12:46.380
 Are these distinct disciplines or no?

1:12:46.380 --> 1:12:47.840
 I don't think they're distinct.

1:12:47.840 --> 1:12:49.960
 I think they're different types of design.

1:12:49.960 --> 1:12:54.960
 I think there's always this idea of this,

1:12:54.960 --> 1:12:58.380
 oh, on the mount, designer, and it all comes down

1:12:58.380 --> 1:13:00.700
 and it all flows down like some magic.

1:13:02.400 --> 1:13:05.320
 There are electrical designers, there's AI designers,

1:13:05.320 --> 1:13:07.720
 there is data scientist designers.

1:13:07.720 --> 1:13:10.580
 Everybody has design, and there's a chapter in the book

1:13:10.580 --> 1:13:12.420
 all about that, actually.

1:13:12.420 --> 1:13:15.000
 That it's not just you go to the mount

1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:17.480
 and it comes down and you're enlightened.

1:13:17.480 --> 1:13:20.720
 It's each person brings their form of design

1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:24.100
 and their craft, because if they're really good,

1:13:24.100 --> 1:13:25.440
 they're artists in their own right.

1:13:25.440 --> 1:13:27.640
 They're not just engineers, they're not just designers,

1:13:27.640 --> 1:13:29.540
 they're artists, they're empathetic,

1:13:29.540 --> 1:13:30.900
 they really wanna bring their best.

1:13:30.900 --> 1:13:32.460
 A lot of the best engineers I have

1:13:32.460 --> 1:13:34.740
 are not the technical, or that I've worked with,

1:13:34.740 --> 1:13:38.160
 are not the technical gotta get it exactly right.

1:13:38.160 --> 1:13:39.800
 They're the artists, they came from music

1:13:39.800 --> 1:13:43.360
 or they came from other things, and they see that.

1:13:43.360 --> 1:13:46.960
 When you work with very rigid engineers,

1:13:46.960 --> 1:13:49.400
 this is the way, the only way, la la la,

1:13:49.400 --> 1:13:52.360
 those are not the engineers I wanna work with.

1:13:52.360 --> 1:13:54.720
 They're all like a bit artists at heart.

1:13:54.720 --> 1:13:59.000
 Right, they understand the practicalness.

1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.220
 They don't have to have the rigidity of,

1:14:01.220 --> 1:14:03.620
 this is the way it's done.

1:14:03.620 --> 1:14:05.120
 Like, mm mm.

1:14:05.120 --> 1:14:07.160
 If you're building something new,

1:14:07.160 --> 1:14:10.400
 all new and revolutionary, none of us are experts at it.

1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:14.360
 And if you come with that expert mindset, just tell me,

1:14:14.360 --> 1:14:15.360
 and I can give you a story,

1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:17.200
 I should probably give you that story,

1:14:18.440 --> 1:14:21.160
 about that if you come with the expert and I'm the expert,

1:14:21.160 --> 1:14:23.760
 when you're doing something no one's ever done before,

1:14:23.760 --> 1:14:25.480
 I don't want you on the team.

1:14:25.480 --> 1:14:27.640
 Because we all are learning about something

1:14:27.640 --> 1:14:30.800
 that has never been in existence before.

1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:33.480
 And we have to bring that level of vulnerability

1:14:33.480 --> 1:14:37.640
 and openness to new ideas and new ways of doing things

1:14:37.640 --> 1:14:39.480
 throughout the team.

1:14:39.480 --> 1:14:42.880
 So you want people that are able to have like

1:14:42.880 --> 1:14:46.400
 beginner's mind or whatever, like don't come in as an expert.

1:14:46.400 --> 1:14:47.320
 What's the story?

1:14:47.320 --> 1:14:48.680
 Okay, here's the story.

1:14:48.680 --> 1:14:50.880
 No, I can tell it for sure.

1:14:50.880 --> 1:14:54.880
 So, you know, you asked what were these risks,

1:14:54.880 --> 1:14:56.520
 you know, like on the early iPod,

1:14:56.520 --> 1:14:58.680
 and there was a few big risks.

1:14:58.680 --> 1:15:00.880
 Like one, and this doesn't go in the story,

1:15:00.880 --> 1:15:03.920
 but like putting rotating media in your pocket

1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:06.120
 and it could drop at any time,

1:15:06.120 --> 1:15:07.040
 what happens there?

1:15:07.040 --> 1:15:08.000
 And like you can damage,

1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:11.000
 because the heads and the hard drive media are so close,

1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:13.240
 it smacks, it's dead, right?

1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:16.640
 So that was one big one, like, holy shit, right?

1:15:16.640 --> 1:15:17.480
 So that was something we,

1:15:17.480 --> 1:15:19.320
 and we had to design special tests and everything

1:15:19.320 --> 1:15:21.040
 and special software on that.

1:15:21.040 --> 1:15:22.000
 But then there was another one,

1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:23.560
 which was at the early days,

1:15:24.560 --> 1:15:26.760
 the way the first generations of iPods,

1:15:26.760 --> 1:15:31.760
 I had to hack the IDE interface to the hard drives.

1:15:32.920 --> 1:15:34.320
 So I was like, okay, what we're gonna use

1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:36.920
 is we're gonna use this chip for hard drive,

1:15:38.200 --> 1:15:40.160
 hard drive, to make a hard drive,

1:15:40.160 --> 1:15:43.520
 you had to have a chip that did FireWire to a hard drive.

1:15:43.520 --> 1:15:46.760
 Okay, and then that would become a portable hard drive.

1:15:46.760 --> 1:15:50.680
 Well, then we had the MP3 player

1:15:50.680 --> 1:15:52.360
 and the user interface and everything.

1:15:52.360 --> 1:15:54.480
 So there was times when it was just this hard drive

1:15:54.480 --> 1:15:57.440
 and there was times when it was a MP3 player

1:15:57.440 --> 1:16:00.640
 and I had to hot switch between

1:16:00.640 --> 1:16:03.920
 what the hard drive thinks it was talking to, right?

1:16:03.920 --> 1:16:05.800
 So designed this thing, tore it apart,

1:16:05.800 --> 1:16:06.640
 did all this stuff.

1:16:06.640 --> 1:16:08.520
 And I was like, you know,

1:16:08.520 --> 1:16:10.880
 maybe I'm gonna screw up IDE and there's something,

1:16:10.880 --> 1:16:13.040
 there's some holes I'm gonna see.

1:16:13.040 --> 1:16:15.400
 So I go, who's the expert at Apple

1:16:15.400 --> 1:16:18.400
 who understands IDE and everything?

1:16:18.400 --> 1:16:21.160
 So this person comes over,

1:16:21.160 --> 1:16:23.440
 the mass storage specialist comes over

1:16:23.440 --> 1:16:24.960
 and I put on the whiteboard and say,

1:16:24.960 --> 1:16:25.880
 here's how we're gonna do this thing

1:16:25.880 --> 1:16:27.040
 and here's the commands and da da,

1:16:27.040 --> 1:16:28.440
 and this is how it hot switches and everything.

1:16:28.440 --> 1:16:30.680
 He's like, that's never gonna work.

1:16:30.680 --> 1:16:31.680
 Yeah.

1:16:31.680 --> 1:16:32.960
 And I was like, what?

1:16:32.960 --> 1:16:33.880
 It was never gonna work.

1:16:33.880 --> 1:16:35.120
 I said, well, let me go over here

1:16:35.120 --> 1:16:36.240
 and show you this right here.

1:16:36.240 --> 1:16:38.760
 I have it prototyped and it's been working for days.

1:16:38.760 --> 1:16:40.120
 I just wanna see if you're gonna have it,

1:16:40.120 --> 1:16:41.960
 find any holes in the thing.

1:16:41.960 --> 1:16:44.280
 Didn't even, and he just stormed out of the room

1:16:44.280 --> 1:16:46.800
 and never even, right?

1:16:46.800 --> 1:16:47.840
 That's hilarious.

1:16:47.840 --> 1:16:50.760
 I've had a lot of experience like this with experts.

1:16:50.760 --> 1:16:53.240
 Like for example, this ridiculous room.

1:16:54.640 --> 1:16:59.200
 I had a person and there's many people like this

1:16:59.200 --> 1:17:03.200
 that I showed them, here's the situation, you know.

1:17:03.200 --> 1:17:04.040
 For acoustics or something?

1:17:04.040 --> 1:17:04.960
 For acoustics, yeah.

1:17:04.960 --> 1:17:07.960
 They're like, no, no, no, no, this is horrible.

1:17:07.960 --> 1:17:11.720
 This is not, this is not gonna work.

1:17:11.720 --> 1:17:15.840
 The reflection, the curtains are not gonna stop.

1:17:15.840 --> 1:17:19.440
 There's a bunch of terminology they're telling me.

1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:22.000
 It's a similar kind of situation as the ID,

1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:25.400
 which I was like, no, listen,

1:17:25.400 --> 1:17:27.640
 I just need to see is there major issues

1:17:27.640 --> 1:17:30.200
 and they're like a low hanging fruit that are fixable

1:17:30.200 --> 1:17:32.120
 and major holes I should be aware of.

1:17:32.120 --> 1:17:33.640
 Not like, let's.

1:17:33.640 --> 1:17:35.520
 $100,000 to upgrade.

1:17:35.520 --> 1:17:38.320
 To upgrade for what exact purpose?

1:17:38.320 --> 1:17:39.360
 What, not why?

1:17:39.360 --> 1:17:40.880
 Yeah, exactly, exactly.

1:17:40.880 --> 1:17:44.680
 The why, the focusing on the story, on the content,

1:17:44.680 --> 1:17:46.760
 on the, the why, the why, the why.

1:17:46.760 --> 1:17:49.880
 And that actually I've experienced that unfortunately

1:17:49.880 --> 1:17:53.560
 in the artistic realms too, which is like photography

1:17:53.560 --> 1:17:56.320
 and videography, cinematography.

1:17:56.320 --> 1:17:58.640
 It's interesting, I talk to photographers

1:17:58.640 --> 1:18:01.000
 that are quote unquote experts.

1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:04.360
 And it's always about so much of the focus

1:18:04.360 --> 1:18:08.040
 is on the equipment.

1:18:08.040 --> 1:18:12.520
 The equipment behind the sensors and the lighting.

1:18:12.520 --> 1:18:15.280
 And it's like, all right, all right.

1:18:16.200 --> 1:18:21.200
 But what about, what about the feeling

1:18:22.680 --> 1:18:26.120
 of the story you create visually?

1:18:26.120 --> 1:18:30.920
 The difference between a movie that's really well told

1:18:30.920 --> 1:18:33.040
 and it doesn't have all the effects and everything

1:18:33.040 --> 1:18:35.200
 versus maybe some of the superhero movies

1:18:35.200 --> 1:18:38.160
 we see all the time, which is good luck if there's a story

1:18:38.160 --> 1:18:41.680
 but man, there's a lot of action and CGI, right?

1:18:41.680 --> 1:18:42.520
 That's right.

1:18:42.520 --> 1:18:46.160
 And there's also value to those, right?

1:18:46.160 --> 1:18:48.240
 CGI, superhero.

1:18:48.240 --> 1:18:49.640
 Can tell a better story

1:18:49.640 --> 1:18:51.840
 but you have to have a good story to begin with.

1:18:51.840 --> 1:18:53.040
 Sure, exactly.

1:18:53.040 --> 1:18:55.560
 But if you're focused on the story,

1:18:55.560 --> 1:18:57.360
 I guess you need to start with a story.

1:18:57.360 --> 1:18:58.840
 You need to start with a story.

1:18:58.840 --> 1:19:01.560
 And if you bring in experts,

1:19:01.560 --> 1:19:06.560
 they can often be detrimental, I guess, to the why.

1:19:07.400 --> 1:19:09.080
 They're too good at doing the what.

1:19:09.080 --> 1:19:11.560
 Well, you can bring in experts for why.

1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:13.840
 There's lots of experts for why.

1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:16.480
 Too many times we get experts for what.

1:19:16.480 --> 1:19:17.320
 Yes.

1:19:17.320 --> 1:19:19.200
 And then they only focus on the what.

1:19:19.200 --> 1:19:21.680
 And so they come with the specs and feeds

1:19:21.680 --> 1:19:24.120
 and the numbers and all the other stuff.

1:19:24.120 --> 1:19:25.960
 But what you're really asking for is I need somebody

1:19:25.960 --> 1:19:27.320
 about the why and understanding

1:19:27.320 --> 1:19:29.320
 what we're trying to get done here

1:19:29.320 --> 1:19:32.560
 and fitting the what's into that why, right?

1:19:32.560 --> 1:19:37.560
 That's why I do think that one of the qualities

1:19:37.720 --> 1:19:39.800
 that I really enjoy for people to work with

1:19:39.800 --> 1:19:41.880
 is like humility for a particular problem

1:19:41.880 --> 1:19:43.120
 when you approach it.

1:19:43.120 --> 1:19:45.560
 Basically, I don't know how to solve this

1:19:45.560 --> 1:19:47.320
 but we're going to figure it out.

1:19:47.320 --> 1:19:51.040
 As opposed to, oh, I've solved this thing many, many times

1:19:51.040 --> 1:19:53.480
 before I know exactly what to do.

1:19:53.480 --> 1:19:55.760
 Humility before the chaos.

1:19:55.760 --> 1:19:59.240
 So having an open mind that this is going to require

1:19:59.240 --> 1:20:01.760
 a totally new way of doing things.

1:20:01.760 --> 1:20:03.600
 It's a really nice quality to see.

1:20:05.560 --> 1:20:07.320
 You're one of the fascinating humans

1:20:07.320 --> 1:20:09.600
 in the history of Silicon Valley.

1:20:09.600 --> 1:20:11.400
 Steve is another one of those.

1:20:11.400 --> 1:20:13.840
 So those two humans came together for a time

1:20:13.840 --> 1:20:15.200
 to work together.

1:20:15.200 --> 1:20:18.840
 What was it like working with Steve Jobs?

1:20:18.840 --> 1:20:22.480
 What aspect of his behavior and personality,

1:20:22.480 --> 1:20:25.800
 let's say, brought out the best in you?

1:20:25.800 --> 1:20:28.560
 Pushing you, really pushing you,

1:20:28.560 --> 1:20:30.560
 relentless on the details,

1:20:30.560 --> 1:20:33.840
 challenging you for the right reasons.

1:20:33.840 --> 1:20:36.360
 It wasn't bullying, it wasn't demeaning.

1:20:36.360 --> 1:20:39.080
 He would critique the work, not judge the person,

1:20:39.080 --> 1:20:41.320
 at least not in front of them.

1:20:41.320 --> 1:20:43.400
 Or inside of a, you know, in front of a group

1:20:43.400 --> 1:20:44.800
 or anything like that.

1:20:44.800 --> 1:20:46.840
 I know it was really that attention to detail.

1:20:46.840 --> 1:20:50.280
 And he, when he would make a decision, you know,

1:20:50.280 --> 1:20:52.680
 there are, when you make the first version of anything,

1:20:52.680 --> 1:20:53.880
 something revolutionary,

1:20:53.880 --> 1:20:56.480
 there are a lot of opinion based decisions.

1:20:56.480 --> 1:20:59.160
 And there's only one or two people, three people

1:20:59.160 --> 1:21:01.560
 who hold those opinion based decisions

1:21:01.560 --> 1:21:03.000
 and what they should be.

1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:06.520
 And when you have those opinions

1:21:07.920 --> 1:21:09.840
 and you're trying to work with the team

1:21:09.840 --> 1:21:13.680
 to implement those decisions,

1:21:13.680 --> 1:21:16.840
 you have to really tell the why of those decisions.

1:21:16.840 --> 1:21:19.840
 Just don't go do it, but why it's there.

1:21:19.840 --> 1:21:23.720
 So you can feel part of that decision.

1:21:23.720 --> 1:21:27.000
 You can understand what were the trade offs

1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:31.080
 of the different other answers to that opinion, right?

1:21:31.080 --> 1:21:35.200
 And say, this is the reason why we picked the route we picked

1:21:35.200 --> 1:21:36.640
 because it's this for the customer

1:21:36.640 --> 1:21:38.760
 or this for the whole world story, what have you.

1:21:38.760 --> 1:21:40.920
 So that you felt really good

1:21:40.920 --> 1:21:42.600
 because a lot of times most people

1:21:42.600 --> 1:21:44.280
 want a data driven decision,

1:21:45.120 --> 1:21:48.080
 but with the ones you don't get data, right?

1:21:48.080 --> 1:21:50.000
 Maybe in a B2B, you could a little bit

1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:51.280
 cause you can talk to customers,

1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:52.960
 but you can't do that with a consumer product.

1:21:52.960 --> 1:21:57.080
 V1, version one, B2B, business to business

1:21:57.080 --> 1:21:59.280
 versus what's the alternative?

1:21:59.280 --> 1:22:01.160
 Business to consumer, V1.

1:22:01.160 --> 1:22:03.800
 Okay, we're just defining some terms.

1:22:05.040 --> 1:22:06.360
 Yes, you're absolutely.

1:22:06.360 --> 1:22:09.720
 And when you say data driven decisions versus what?

1:22:09.720 --> 1:22:11.200
 Opinion based decisions.

1:22:11.200 --> 1:22:14.280
 So like gut, you have to use, you don't have any.

1:22:14.280 --> 1:22:19.280
 You can't fall back on any data or any previous history

1:22:19.840 --> 1:22:23.040
 to kind of inform you of what's going on, right?

1:22:23.040 --> 1:22:27.720
 And so if you look at most companies who are paralyzed

1:22:27.720 --> 1:22:31.760
 and cannot make new innovations and new products,

1:22:31.760 --> 1:22:33.520
 it's because they're trying to turn,

1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:35.040
 and this is what I saw at Phillips,

1:22:35.040 --> 1:22:37.320
 they're trying to turn opinion based decisions

1:22:37.320 --> 1:22:40.720
 into data driven decisions so they don't lose their jobs.

1:22:41.640 --> 1:22:43.920
 So if you look at management consulting,

1:22:43.920 --> 1:22:46.160
 management consulting is all about

1:22:46.160 --> 1:22:48.440
 taking those opinion based decisions,

1:22:48.440 --> 1:22:50.960
 giving them to someone else to turn into data

1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:52.840
 that comes back to them and says,

1:22:52.840 --> 1:22:55.640
 they can blame the management consultants

1:22:55.640 --> 1:22:57.120
 when something goes wrong,

1:22:57.120 --> 1:23:01.080
 as opposed to it wasn't me, right?

1:23:01.080 --> 1:23:03.120
 When you need to have to tell that story,

1:23:03.120 --> 1:23:06.040
 you have to understand that, especially V1,

1:23:06.040 --> 1:23:09.640
 you need to be able to articulate

1:23:09.640 --> 1:23:14.200
 those opinion based decisions and you need to own them.

1:23:14.200 --> 1:23:17.440
 And if you fail with some of them, you didn't get it right,

1:23:17.440 --> 1:23:21.840
 you then own them and fix them and move on, right?

1:23:21.840 --> 1:23:23.920
 Version one of the iPod wasn't perfect.

1:23:23.920 --> 1:23:25.880
 Version one of the iPhone wasn't perfect.

1:23:25.880 --> 1:23:28.280
 We got a lot of opinion based decisions wrong.

1:23:29.240 --> 1:23:31.920
 But as you go through that, because you got more data,

1:23:31.920 --> 1:23:34.880
 because V2, you had data on those original opinions

1:23:34.880 --> 1:23:37.400
 and then you were able to then modulate off of that, right?

1:23:37.400 --> 1:23:38.720
 And you'll still have new opinions

1:23:38.720 --> 1:23:40.520
 because those are differentiators

1:23:40.520 --> 1:23:42.520
 that we call differentiators,

1:23:42.520 --> 1:23:47.520
 the things that move the product forward in its evolution.

1:23:48.200 --> 1:23:49.800
 But at the revolution stage,

1:23:49.800 --> 1:23:52.520
 opinions, opinions, opinions, no data.

1:23:52.520 --> 1:23:55.560
 And so you have this discussion, you and Steve

1:23:55.560 --> 1:24:00.560
 in the stage and the whole team with opinions.

1:24:02.120 --> 1:24:04.280
 And there you have to be harsh.

1:24:04.280 --> 1:24:08.120
 And I wouldn't say harsh,

1:24:08.120 --> 1:24:10.320
 but you have to be very determined, right?

1:24:10.320 --> 1:24:13.240
 You know, there are two real opinion based decisions

1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:15.280
 that happened on the iPhone.

1:24:15.280 --> 1:24:18.000
 One was the keyboard.

1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:19.720
 Should we have a hardboard keyboard

1:24:19.720 --> 1:24:21.400
 or should we have a virtual keyboard?

1:24:21.400 --> 1:24:23.640
 The Blackberry was the number one

1:24:23.640 --> 1:24:26.840
 productivity messaging device of its time.

1:24:26.840 --> 1:24:29.200
 It was called a Crackberry for a reason

1:24:29.200 --> 1:24:31.920
 because people loved it because it was easy to type

1:24:31.920 --> 1:24:34.840
 and they could get their work done.

1:24:34.840 --> 1:24:36.840
 But when you're saying we're gonna move from that,

1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:38.680
 everyone's talking about that in the market

1:24:38.680 --> 1:24:41.280
 and you say we're gonna move to a virtual keyboard

1:24:41.280 --> 1:24:44.720
 and it's not gonna work as well as the hardware keyboard,

1:24:44.720 --> 1:24:46.880
 that's an opinion based decision, right?

1:24:46.880 --> 1:24:48.400
 Because the data is telling you

1:24:49.800 --> 1:24:51.360
 all the best sales are over here.

1:24:51.360 --> 1:24:53.120
 God, that takes guts.

1:24:53.120 --> 1:24:54.720
 It takes guts, but you have to look at it

1:24:54.720 --> 1:24:56.160
 from a different point of view.

1:24:56.160 --> 1:24:59.320
 And this is how I learned to come to understand this

1:24:59.320 --> 1:25:02.360
 because I had been building virtual keyboards before

1:25:02.360 --> 1:25:06.520
 and I knew the goodness and the badness in them, right?

1:25:06.520 --> 1:25:09.160
 But he was like, look, those are productivity devices.

1:25:09.160 --> 1:25:12.840
 We're making it, ours is born out of an entertainment device

1:25:12.840 --> 1:25:14.840
 and productivity, right?

1:25:14.840 --> 1:25:16.960
 We need to show full screen videos.

1:25:16.960 --> 1:25:19.960
 We are gonna have apps, not apps, but our apps,

1:25:19.960 --> 1:25:22.320
 the Apple apps, cause there were no app store yet,

1:25:22.320 --> 1:25:23.440
 are gonna take over the whole screen.

1:25:23.440 --> 1:25:25.440
 You want a full screen web browser.

1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:27.600
 You don't want one that's like half of the device

1:25:27.600 --> 1:25:28.520
 is just a keyboard.

1:25:28.520 --> 1:25:30.520
 Maybe you don't need that keyboard in every instance.

1:25:30.520 --> 1:25:32.360
 So we want that part of the screen to change

1:25:32.360 --> 1:25:34.680
 based on the tool you may need at the time.

1:25:34.680 --> 1:25:36.880
 And maybe it's just full view, right?

1:25:36.880 --> 1:25:38.080
 So you have to go and understand

1:25:38.080 --> 1:25:39.360
 it's a different type of device,

1:25:39.360 --> 1:25:42.200
 just cause that's that and it's successful for that reason,

1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:43.880
 the crackberry for the keyboard.

1:25:43.880 --> 1:25:46.080
 That's not the only thing you're gonna do with this device

1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:47.920
 cause people only did messaging

1:25:47.920 --> 1:25:49.720
 and maybe a few phone calls, right?

1:25:49.720 --> 1:25:50.880
 This was gonna be so much more.

1:25:50.880 --> 1:25:53.400
 It was gonna be an entertainment web browsing device.

1:25:53.400 --> 1:25:55.560
 So you wanted those tools to go away,

1:25:55.560 --> 1:25:58.760
 but it wouldn't be as good as the hardware keyboard.

1:25:58.760 --> 1:25:59.680
 So that's an opinion.

1:25:59.680 --> 1:26:01.840
 But let me give you another opinion based decision

1:26:01.840 --> 1:26:03.840
 that got turned around before it shipped.

1:26:04.720 --> 1:26:07.240
 Steve said, no SIM slot.

1:26:07.240 --> 1:26:08.440
 I don't want any slots.

1:26:08.440 --> 1:26:10.400
 We're gonna make it very pure.

1:26:10.400 --> 1:26:12.200
 Johnny was like, of course, no slots.

1:26:13.120 --> 1:26:13.960
 Johnny, hi.

1:26:14.760 --> 1:26:18.600
 And we all looked around and go, that doesn't work.

1:26:18.600 --> 1:26:19.440
 You can't do that.

1:26:19.440 --> 1:26:20.280
 Well, why does Varite?

1:26:20.280 --> 1:26:22.440
 And then he would always, and this was the magic of Steve,

1:26:22.440 --> 1:26:24.040
 like when you said, no, that doesn't work,

1:26:24.040 --> 1:26:27.520
 you'd go, well, why does Verizon not have any SIM slots?

1:26:27.520 --> 1:26:29.280
 They showed that you can do a mobile phone

1:26:29.280 --> 1:26:30.120
 with no SIM slots.

1:26:30.120 --> 1:26:32.360
 And you're like, okay, here we go.

1:26:32.360 --> 1:26:35.680
 And so a few days later, we come back with,

1:26:36.960 --> 1:26:40.080
 so product marketing, voice of the customer, engineering,

1:26:40.080 --> 1:26:41.480
 we all come back with all the data

1:26:41.480 --> 1:26:46.200
 showing how many data networks and mobile networks

1:26:46.200 --> 1:26:50.560
 required SIM cards versus did not and what the trends were.

1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:54.800
 And so we showed the data and that killed the,

1:26:54.800 --> 1:26:56.960
 or excuse me, brought back the SIM slot

1:26:56.960 --> 1:26:58.440
 on the original iPhone.

1:26:58.440 --> 1:27:01.320
 Because we're like, because he was just like,

1:27:01.320 --> 1:27:04.400
 we're gonna tell AT&T to not use a SIM, right?

1:27:04.400 --> 1:27:06.880
 We're gonna just tell them to do it differently, right?

1:27:06.880 --> 1:27:07.720
 But we were like,

1:27:07.720 --> 1:27:09.560
 if we want this thing to go anywhere around the world,

1:27:09.560 --> 1:27:11.240
 you wanna put that friction in.

1:27:11.240 --> 1:27:13.120
 People are gonna move from place to place.

1:27:13.120 --> 1:27:14.440
 They have different SIMs

1:27:14.440 --> 1:27:16.080
 because of the prices and all that stuff.

1:27:16.080 --> 1:27:17.800
 We had to show all of that data.

1:27:17.800 --> 1:27:20.960
 And then that opinion based decision got turned

1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:22.800
 into a data driven decision.

1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:25.480
 And the SIM slot obviously showed up.

1:27:25.480 --> 1:27:28.920
 So those are two very, at the very same time, right?

1:27:29.880 --> 1:27:33.640
 Opinion can hold and so can data overrule opinion

1:27:33.640 --> 1:27:36.120
 when data does exist for a V1.

1:27:36.120 --> 1:27:37.600
 But at the end of the day,

1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:40.480
 you don't know what the right answer is.

1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:45.480
 So doing no SIM card slot

1:27:45.480 --> 1:27:47.720
 may have been the right decision.

1:27:47.720 --> 1:27:49.240
 We won't know.

1:27:49.240 --> 1:27:53.520
 Because maybe if that was the decision,

1:27:53.520 --> 1:27:56.120
 then like many times throughout Apple's history,

1:27:56.120 --> 1:28:01.280
 you basically changed the tide of how technology is done.

1:28:01.280 --> 1:28:03.520
 Absolutely, you never know.

1:28:03.520 --> 1:28:05.160
 Apple started WiFi.

1:28:05.160 --> 1:28:06.840
 People don't understand WiFi came out of there.

1:28:06.840 --> 1:28:08.760
 There was no WiFi in 2001.

1:28:08.760 --> 1:28:10.360
 Apple started WiFi.

1:28:10.360 --> 1:28:13.520
 And then everyone else got on board.

1:28:13.520 --> 1:28:15.160
 If you look at now where we're going,

1:28:15.160 --> 1:28:17.560
 we're going to phones without SIM slots.

1:28:17.560 --> 1:28:18.880
 Cause we have eSIMs, right?

1:28:18.880 --> 1:28:21.320
 And now the SIM slots becoming legacy, legacy.

1:28:21.320 --> 1:28:23.040
 It's a legacy port.

1:28:23.040 --> 1:28:24.720
 That legacy port will probably be gone

1:28:24.720 --> 1:28:28.480
 by six, maybe 10 years.

1:28:28.480 --> 1:28:29.480
 It'll be gone.

1:28:29.480 --> 1:28:31.400
 I'm pretty sure of that.

1:28:31.400 --> 1:28:32.640
 Because it's so much easier for carriers.

1:28:32.640 --> 1:28:35.880
 They don't have to have physical things to go out and right.

1:28:35.880 --> 1:28:38.640
 So right now it's just the early days,

1:28:38.640 --> 1:28:41.080
 but it will happen and it will go its way.

1:28:41.080 --> 1:28:43.120
 It'll fall away, but it will take time.

1:28:43.120 --> 1:28:44.920
 You just couldn't do it back then.

1:28:44.920 --> 1:28:47.960
 So timing is essential here, but at the end of the day,

1:28:47.960 --> 1:28:49.920
 it's opinions and that's where the genius is.

1:28:49.920 --> 1:28:52.080
 Sometimes the data tells you one thing,

1:28:52.080 --> 1:28:55.880
 but the data at the end of the day does represent the past.

1:28:55.880 --> 1:28:56.720
 Exactly.

1:28:56.720 --> 1:28:59.040
 And the future may be different than the past.

1:28:59.040 --> 1:29:00.560
 Right.

1:29:00.560 --> 1:29:03.560
 Sometimes there's wisdom in the past

1:29:03.560 --> 1:29:06.600
 and sometimes it's actually representative

1:29:06.600 --> 1:29:09.120
 of something that should be overcome

1:29:09.120 --> 1:29:12.400
 and progress looks like leaving that stuff behind.

1:29:12.400 --> 1:29:15.400
 Like the headphone jack.

1:29:15.400 --> 1:29:16.560
 Right.

1:29:16.560 --> 1:29:20.160
 I mean that when different folks were getting rid

1:29:20.160 --> 1:29:25.160
 of the headphone jack, boy, I would love to be a fly

1:29:25.600 --> 1:29:27.960
 in the wall of those discussions.

1:29:27.960 --> 1:29:31.600
 We had that, oh, that was a discussion

1:29:31.600 --> 1:29:34.280
 that happened almost every year.

1:29:34.280 --> 1:29:35.400
 That was an every year,

1:29:35.400 --> 1:29:38.760
 should we get rid of headphone jacks on the iPod, right?

1:29:38.760 --> 1:29:41.360
 When are wireless headsets gonna happen, right?

1:29:41.360 --> 1:29:44.480
 And it took years to build all the right protocols,

1:29:44.480 --> 1:29:47.240
 the chips, all those things to make the experience

1:29:47.240 --> 1:29:50.880
 that is the iPods today, right?

1:29:50.880 --> 1:29:52.480
 To say, have the confidence,

1:29:52.480 --> 1:29:55.640
 cause Bluetooth was good, but it wasn't Apple like.

1:29:55.640 --> 1:29:57.440
 So that is like, we gotta make our own chips,

1:29:57.440 --> 1:29:59.000
 we gotta make our own software stacks.

1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:01.920
 Now we have the confidence to remove the headphone jack

1:30:01.920 --> 1:30:04.840
 and actually make you pay $200 more for your iPhone

1:30:04.840 --> 1:30:07.320
 that you were just paying because of the headphone jack.

1:30:07.320 --> 1:30:09.200
 Now we've grown our revenue,

1:30:09.200 --> 1:30:11.880
 we've given a new experience to the user, right?

1:30:11.880 --> 1:30:15.640
 And ta da, you know, and it's just, it's magic.

1:30:15.640 --> 1:30:17.960
 And now the world's transformed to everyone,

1:30:17.960 --> 1:30:19.920
 you know, moving to that, right?

1:30:19.920 --> 1:30:22.840
 But it took years to understand the problem,

1:30:22.840 --> 1:30:26.720
 develop the technology and not just rush it to market

1:30:26.720 --> 1:30:28.880
 to get a half experience, but to get it right

1:30:28.880 --> 1:30:31.000
 and refine it, then ship it.

1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:33.240
 And only then after it was probably four

1:30:33.240 --> 1:30:34.800
 or five years in development,

1:30:34.800 --> 1:30:37.960
 just like the M1 processor, right?

1:30:37.960 --> 1:30:42.040
 That was a work from 2008, right?

1:30:43.200 --> 1:30:45.320
 Grinding away, grinding away, grinding away,

1:30:45.320 --> 1:30:47.040
 then saying, okay, now we have the confidence

1:30:47.040 --> 1:30:49.600
 we're doing our own silicon for all the iPhones

1:30:49.600 --> 1:30:54.600
 and iPads and such.

1:30:54.680 --> 1:30:56.120
 Now we're gonna turn to the Mac

1:30:56.120 --> 1:30:58.200
 and make sure we have the best processor, right?

1:30:58.200 --> 1:31:01.600
 Not just that we have the best integrated design team.

1:31:01.600 --> 1:31:03.600
 And then saying we're gonna, you know,

1:31:03.600 --> 1:31:06.960
 and then besting everyone, making sure the softwares

1:31:06.960 --> 1:31:09.440
 and the hardware is designed at the same time,

1:31:09.440 --> 1:31:11.120
 making sure the kernels, all those things

1:31:11.120 --> 1:31:16.120
 are gonna use the best efficiency and then popping it out.

1:31:16.600 --> 1:31:18.560
 And then it feels seamless.

1:31:18.560 --> 1:31:19.400
 It's magic.

1:31:19.400 --> 1:31:21.920
 There were no, as far as I could tell,

1:31:21.920 --> 1:31:23.680
 unless you were in real esoteric drivers

1:31:23.680 --> 1:31:25.960
 or something like that, it just worked.

1:31:25.960 --> 1:31:27.080
 It was magic.

1:31:27.080 --> 1:31:29.520
 Like the transition, it was not even a speed bump.

1:31:29.520 --> 1:31:32.200
 It was not even a crack in the road.

1:31:32.200 --> 1:31:36.480
 So perhaps famously Steve had a bit of a temper.

1:31:36.480 --> 1:31:41.480
 Steve Jobs, would you say his particular personality

1:31:41.480 --> 1:31:46.120
 in this aspect was constructive or destructive

1:31:46.120 --> 1:31:51.120
 in the process of shaping these opinion based ideas?

1:31:55.360 --> 1:32:00.360
 So in Build, I write a chapter called Assholes.

1:32:00.920 --> 1:32:05.840
 Yes, and you lay out beautifully the types of assholes

1:32:05.840 --> 1:32:09.480
 and maybe you could speak to the constructive

1:32:09.480 --> 1:32:12.480
 and the destructive types of assholes.

1:32:13.600 --> 1:32:18.600
 So there's really two delineations that I've found

1:32:18.640 --> 1:32:20.600
 of real fundamental ones.

1:32:20.600 --> 1:32:23.320
 And that is again, the why.

1:32:24.560 --> 1:32:26.760
 Why do I feel this person is an asshole?

1:32:27.840 --> 1:32:28.880
 They might not be.

1:32:30.160 --> 1:32:32.640
 I feel this is a person who's an asshole.

1:32:32.640 --> 1:32:34.720
 Are they motivated by their ego

1:32:35.680 --> 1:32:38.280
 or are they motivated by their mission?

1:32:38.280 --> 1:32:39.640
 Something they're trying to do

1:32:39.640 --> 1:32:43.200
 and doing in service of something else, right?

1:32:43.200 --> 1:32:44.800
 Sometimes those lines can be blurry,

1:32:44.800 --> 1:32:46.560
 but it's usually pretty clear.

1:32:48.960 --> 1:32:52.960
 When it's ego motivated, it's clear they're just trying

1:32:52.960 --> 1:32:55.760
 to get up in the ranks, push people down,

1:32:55.760 --> 1:32:57.400
 shove people aside.

1:32:57.400 --> 1:33:00.560
 I think we saw a president do that on a stage once.

1:33:00.560 --> 1:33:05.560
 I'm me and I'm the guy, right?

1:33:06.960 --> 1:33:09.280
 And I'm gonna prove it by pushing everyone away

1:33:09.280 --> 1:33:11.640
 and being nefarious or what have you.

1:33:11.640 --> 1:33:15.440
 Either passively aggressive or aggressively aggressive,

1:33:16.360 --> 1:33:18.360
 but they're doing about themselves.

1:33:18.360 --> 1:33:21.760
 There's another one, which is someone who's so attentive

1:33:21.760 --> 1:33:26.480
 to detail and unrelenting that they're trying to get

1:33:26.480 --> 1:33:28.600
 the right things for the country.

1:33:28.600 --> 1:33:31.960
 They're trying to get the right things for the customer

1:33:31.960 --> 1:33:33.920
 or in service of their mission.

1:33:33.920 --> 1:33:37.920
 And they wanna make sure we fulfill those things, right?

1:33:37.920 --> 1:33:39.280
 And they really care.

1:33:39.280 --> 1:33:41.480
 They don't micromanage all the details,

1:33:41.480 --> 1:33:44.480
 but they micromanage the details where the customer,

1:33:44.480 --> 1:33:46.280
 it touches the customer in some way.

1:33:48.520 --> 1:33:51.240
 People who work with those types of people

1:33:51.240 --> 1:33:55.040
 who are unrelenting and push you and might make you upset.

1:33:55.040 --> 1:33:58.200
 A lot of times it's a knee jerk reaction to go,

1:33:58.200 --> 1:33:59.400
 they are an asshole.

1:34:01.920 --> 1:34:05.800
 Get off my back, you're an ass, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1:34:05.800 --> 1:34:09.320
 Right, and you're protecting your ego

1:34:09.320 --> 1:34:11.160
 because what's happening is that person

1:34:11.160 --> 1:34:13.800
 is usually pushing you beyond your boundaries.

1:34:13.800 --> 1:34:18.360
 They see something that we can do or you can do

1:34:18.360 --> 1:34:20.600
 that you're just either not wanting to do

1:34:20.600 --> 1:34:23.600
 for whatever reason, you're not confident in that.

1:34:23.600 --> 1:34:26.240
 You're like, I don't wanna take the extra time

1:34:26.240 --> 1:34:28.880
 and saying, no, we need to get that done and pushing you.

1:34:28.880 --> 1:34:33.880
 Okay, and so when we came to those areas,

1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:36.880
 it wasn't just a one on one,

1:34:36.880 --> 1:34:39.000
 it could be Steve against the team going,

1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:41.320
 we need glass instead of plastic

1:34:41.320 --> 1:34:43.120
 on the front face of the iPhone,

1:34:43.120 --> 1:34:45.480
 and we're going to do this.

1:34:45.480 --> 1:34:49.520
 And we're like, God, you know, and so we did it.

1:34:49.520 --> 1:34:52.520
 And he pushed us because he didn't know all the details,

1:34:52.520 --> 1:34:55.000
 but he could see in our minds that we're like,

1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:57.560
 yeah, we could probably, yeah, we could probably,

1:34:57.560 --> 1:34:59.600
 but man, it's really putting us in risk.

1:34:59.600 --> 1:35:01.560
 And we laid out the risks for him.

1:35:01.560 --> 1:35:03.640
 And he's like, I'm willing to take those risks.

1:35:03.640 --> 1:35:04.480
 We'll do that.

1:35:04.480 --> 1:35:06.480
 We're like, we might be three months late.

1:35:06.480 --> 1:35:08.480
 He's like, this is so important.

1:35:08.480 --> 1:35:09.840
 We need to stay on time.

1:35:11.480 --> 1:35:14.840
 You know, but it would be all the time, push, push, push.

1:35:14.840 --> 1:35:18.280
 It reminds me of like kids growing up and me as growing up,

1:35:18.280 --> 1:35:20.760
 you know, when your parents push you

1:35:20.760 --> 1:35:22.760
 to make you grow beyond your boundaries,

1:35:22.760 --> 1:35:23.720
 your personal boundaries.

1:35:23.720 --> 1:35:27.360
 And you're like, God damn it, I'm so, you know,

1:35:27.360 --> 1:35:28.600
 but they do it for the right reasons.

1:35:28.600 --> 1:35:30.960
 Now let's see, it's not bullying.

1:35:30.960 --> 1:35:31.880
 It's not about bullying.

1:35:31.880 --> 1:35:33.480
 It's not about demeaning.

1:35:33.480 --> 1:35:36.680
 It's about either pushing you to another part of the mission

1:35:36.680 --> 1:35:39.560
 that needs to get done, or it's about critiquing your work,

1:35:39.560 --> 1:35:40.960
 but not judging you.

1:35:40.960 --> 1:35:41.800
 Yes.

1:35:41.800 --> 1:35:43.800
 Well, there's a lot to say there.

1:35:43.800 --> 1:35:46.680
 So one, it's fascinating.

1:35:46.680 --> 1:35:48.120
 It really is fascinating.

1:35:48.120 --> 1:35:49.880
 And you laid out a very nice picture,

1:35:49.880 --> 1:35:54.880
 but it does feel like there's sometimes gray areas,

1:35:55.080 --> 1:35:57.120
 which is why it makes all of this very complicated.

1:35:57.120 --> 1:35:58.480
 So one question I have for you

1:35:58.480 --> 1:36:00.720
 in terms of glass on the iPhone.

1:36:03.040 --> 1:36:08.040
 How important is it that like Steve in that case is right?

1:36:09.600 --> 1:36:12.640
 Because I could argue each side.

1:36:12.640 --> 1:36:14.840
 It seems like in one sense,

1:36:14.840 --> 1:36:18.160
 just having a strong vision and opinion

1:36:18.160 --> 1:36:20.760
 is already going to make everybody grow,

1:36:20.760 --> 1:36:22.920
 even if it turns out to be the wrong.

1:36:22.920 --> 1:36:25.840
 As long as you are sort of standing your ground,

1:36:28.640 --> 1:36:30.680
 you know, Napoleon invading Russia or something

1:36:30.680 --> 1:36:35.360
 in the winter, like it's just not gonna be a good idea.

1:36:35.360 --> 1:36:39.080
 It's not a good idea, but I'm gonna hold to that.

1:36:39.080 --> 1:36:41.680
 And then once you decide, you go all in.

1:36:41.680 --> 1:36:44.080
 And then from that, even if the whole team knows

1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:46.840
 it's the wrong decision, just sticking by it,

1:36:46.840 --> 1:36:50.040
 powering through, you will learn through the pain of it.

1:36:50.040 --> 1:36:51.520
 Like everybody will learn.

1:36:51.520 --> 1:36:53.000
 So that's one side.

1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:58.000
 The other is maybe the asshole, the vision driven asshole

1:36:59.600 --> 1:37:02.600
 gets to be more and more of an asshole

1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:06.800
 if they have a track record of through that process,

1:37:06.800 --> 1:37:10.480
 having built people up, having made the correct decisions.

1:37:10.480 --> 1:37:13.000
 They can't, they're not allowed to be an asshole.

1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:15.120
 They're in rare air and no one can challenge them.

1:37:15.120 --> 1:37:16.560
 Right, right.

1:37:16.560 --> 1:37:18.680
 Steve was never that.

1:37:18.680 --> 1:37:19.760
 That's the great thing.

1:37:19.760 --> 1:37:22.680
 He was never unchallengeable.

1:37:22.680 --> 1:37:23.520
 You could challenge him.

1:37:23.520 --> 1:37:28.520
 Now the plastic to glass story is a perfect example of this.

1:37:31.160 --> 1:37:33.160
 So at the beginning of the project,

1:37:33.160 --> 1:37:35.080
 well before we were going,

1:37:35.080 --> 1:37:38.680
 we had always had these things about plastic front iPods,

1:37:38.680 --> 1:37:41.320
 these kinds of things, scratches and all that stuff.

1:37:41.320 --> 1:37:46.320
 So we said, oh, we're gonna have a glass or a plastic,

1:37:46.320 --> 1:37:47.800
 a cover for the display.

1:37:47.800 --> 1:37:50.200
 Cause the display was glass underneath it.

1:37:51.200 --> 1:37:54.720
 We argued back and forth about glass versus plastic.

1:37:54.720 --> 1:37:58.320
 And then we all landed together on plastic.

1:38:00.080 --> 1:38:03.240
 Okay, the original decision was plastic.

1:38:03.240 --> 1:38:06.320
 And the reasons were, okay, we don't wanna make a mistake.

1:38:06.320 --> 1:38:08.960
 Glass can break, you know,

1:38:08.960 --> 1:38:11.400
 people drop them all the time.

1:38:11.400 --> 1:38:14.200
 So we don't wanna have a fragile device

1:38:14.200 --> 1:38:17.120
 because you're gonna be using even more

1:38:17.120 --> 1:38:19.520
 than a music player, right?

1:38:20.520 --> 1:38:21.760
 And you're gonna be holding your head

1:38:21.760 --> 1:38:24.880
 and putting it in your pocket and misses and all that stuff.

1:38:24.880 --> 1:38:27.320
 So we went down the road with plastic.

1:38:27.320 --> 1:38:30.720
 When it was shown, when the product was shown

1:38:30.720 --> 1:38:35.720
 at Mac World in 2007, the first time, that was plastic.

1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:39.640
 We had just enough of them in the field at the time.

1:38:39.640 --> 1:38:43.640
 We started to start seeing light scratches on the plastic.

1:38:45.840 --> 1:38:48.120
 Reviewers who didn't have the device yet,

1:38:48.120 --> 1:38:49.560
 cause it was behind glass.

1:38:49.560 --> 1:38:52.960
 If you remember 2007, the Jesus phone comes up

1:38:52.960 --> 1:38:54.280
 and no one could even touch them.

1:38:54.280 --> 1:38:55.280
 You could just look at it

1:38:55.280 --> 1:38:57.800
 in this beautiful museum quality box.

1:38:57.800 --> 1:39:00.560
 Like it came from the future or whatever, the past.

1:39:00.560 --> 1:39:02.040
 And it was just plastic.

1:39:02.040 --> 1:39:06.080
 And it was like, oh, and you just looked

1:39:06.080 --> 1:39:07.400
 and that was all you got.

1:39:07.400 --> 1:39:10.560
 But then people said, well, what screen is,

1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:13.200
 what covers on that, you know, reviewers who knew better,

1:39:13.200 --> 1:39:15.440
 you know, it's plastic.

1:39:15.440 --> 1:39:16.960
 And they were like, really?

1:39:17.840 --> 1:39:20.000
 And so there was enough of a doubt there.

1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:21.440
 And then when we started to do it,

1:39:21.440 --> 1:39:24.080
 and then Steve changed the frame of reference

1:39:24.080 --> 1:39:26.560
 of the question or of the result

1:39:26.560 --> 1:39:28.200
 of what the customer would think.

1:39:28.200 --> 1:39:31.360
 And he was like, if we designed it with plastic,

1:39:31.360 --> 1:39:34.360
 with plastic and it's in their pocket all the time

1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:36.920
 and it gets scratched by coins, slightly scratched

1:39:36.920 --> 1:39:39.400
 or by keys or something like that.

1:39:39.400 --> 1:39:41.600
 That is a design problem.

1:39:41.600 --> 1:39:42.520
 We need to fix the problem.

1:39:42.520 --> 1:39:44.120
 That was our bad.

1:39:45.480 --> 1:39:49.640
 If they go off and drop it or even slightly drop it

1:39:51.040 --> 1:39:54.440
 and it cracks, it's the customer's fault.

1:39:54.440 --> 1:39:56.200
 And they have much lower,

1:39:56.200 --> 1:39:58.920
 they have less likelihood to complain.

1:39:58.920 --> 1:40:00.240
 Yes, they'll complain,

1:40:00.240 --> 1:40:04.480
 but they're part of that, of that failure.

1:40:04.480 --> 1:40:05.320
 Yes.

1:40:05.320 --> 1:40:06.640
 Oh, that's fascinating.

1:40:06.640 --> 1:40:07.600
 And then.

1:40:07.600 --> 1:40:08.600
 There's truth to that.

1:40:08.600 --> 1:40:09.600
 Right?

1:40:09.600 --> 1:40:11.840
 Because then they were part of why it failed.

1:40:11.840 --> 1:40:13.680
 Whereas the design, they didn't do anything wrong.

1:40:13.680 --> 1:40:16.800
 It was just sitting in their pocket and it's scratching

1:40:16.800 --> 1:40:18.440
 and that's normal use.

1:40:18.440 --> 1:40:19.920
 Abnormal use has been dropped.

1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:23.120
 And we're like, oh, now we get it.

1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:25.960
 And so we all moved to that mindset

1:40:25.960 --> 1:40:30.320
 when you framed the problem and the solution in that way

1:40:30.320 --> 1:40:32.160
 versus the original framing

1:40:32.160 --> 1:40:34.120
 where we all landed on plastic.

1:40:34.120 --> 1:40:37.120
 So, and then he was unrelenting on that,

1:40:37.120 --> 1:40:41.080
 but we all had moved and we had moved mindset

1:40:41.080 --> 1:40:45.560
 and we understood the why and we marshaled together.

1:40:45.560 --> 1:40:48.760
 And then by the end of June, and it was crazy,

1:40:48.760 --> 1:40:52.640
 the mechanical product design teams sourcing,

1:40:52.640 --> 1:40:56.080
 all of us, the partner Corning pulled together

1:40:56.080 --> 1:40:59.440
 to make that happen because it was the right reason.

1:40:59.440 --> 1:41:00.280
 Right?

1:41:00.280 --> 1:41:03.240
 So this, you look at these stories

1:41:03.240 --> 1:41:06.960
 and you hear just the top line rumors of the takeaways,

1:41:06.960 --> 1:41:08.960
 but that's not usually how it all happened

1:41:08.960 --> 1:41:12.160
 of like one leader was, that's not how Steve was.

1:41:12.160 --> 1:41:14.960
 Now I've seen leaders who are just pounding

1:41:14.960 --> 1:41:18.080
 and just had no real empathy for the team

1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:19.120
 and understanding the why.

1:41:19.120 --> 1:41:21.040
 And it's just, it is the way I want it, right?

1:41:21.040 --> 1:41:23.600
 I am the supreme leader.

1:41:23.600 --> 1:41:25.680
 That wasn't like that when.

1:41:25.680 --> 1:41:27.640
 He just had a very strong opinion.

1:41:27.640 --> 1:41:29.280
 Very strong opinion.

1:41:29.280 --> 1:41:30.840
 But it was challengeable.

1:41:30.840 --> 1:41:33.360
 It was challengeable and if you came with the right thing,

1:41:33.360 --> 1:41:35.640
 you know, it was, you could modulate that,

1:41:35.640 --> 1:41:37.080
 but you had to come with a team.

1:41:37.080 --> 1:41:38.240
 It couldn't just be you.

1:41:38.240 --> 1:41:41.560
 It had to become a team and data and to overcome

1:41:41.560 --> 1:41:43.200
 because it was a very strong opinion.

1:41:43.200 --> 1:41:46.480
 And there's personal quirks of character, like you said.

1:41:46.480 --> 1:41:47.760
 Bad days and good days.

1:41:47.760 --> 1:41:48.600
 Bad days and good days.

1:41:48.600 --> 1:41:51.320
 So there's also the three options you said.

1:41:51.320 --> 1:41:53.880
 You noticed that the third option is always going

1:41:53.880 --> 1:41:55.280
 to be the one that's picked.

1:41:56.400 --> 1:41:57.240
 Those kinds of.

1:41:57.240 --> 1:41:58.080
 Idiosyncrasies.

1:41:58.080 --> 1:41:59.480
 Idiosyncrasies.

1:41:59.480 --> 1:42:01.800
 And that, so that brings up another thing.

1:42:04.600 --> 1:42:07.200
 You said challenge the idea, not the person.

1:42:10.200 --> 1:42:13.480
 I'm somebody who has a, you know, I have a temper.

1:42:13.480 --> 1:42:16.000
 I use colorful language and so on.

1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:17.240
 On teams I work.

1:42:17.240 --> 1:42:19.400
 In my private life I'm much calmer and so on.

1:42:19.400 --> 1:42:21.200
 But I get, when I get really passionate

1:42:21.200 --> 1:42:22.400
 with engineering teams.

1:42:23.560 --> 1:42:24.960
 I've been called an asshole.

1:42:24.960 --> 1:42:29.320
 And you get, I mean, I am distinctly aware

1:42:29.320 --> 1:42:32.400
 that you cross lines often.

1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:35.760
 There's like levels, right?

1:42:35.760 --> 1:42:36.680
 Sure.

1:42:36.680 --> 1:42:39.280
 You know, you could, it has to do with language

1:42:39.280 --> 1:42:41.120
 and how language is heard.

1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:43.480
 So for example, you could say a lot of stuff to me.

1:42:43.480 --> 1:42:44.520
 You could swear.

1:42:44.520 --> 1:42:49.520
 You could say stuff that sounds, like, I don't know.

1:42:49.720 --> 1:42:53.400
 Lex, sometimes I think you're the dumbest human

1:42:53.400 --> 1:42:54.640
 on the face of the earth or something.

1:42:54.640 --> 1:42:55.720
 I don't know.

1:42:55.720 --> 1:42:57.360
 That sounds very personal, right?

1:42:57.360 --> 1:42:58.840
 But I'm not gonna take that personally.

1:42:58.840 --> 1:43:00.360
 I understand what's being said.

1:43:00.360 --> 1:43:02.480
 And then I also notice that there's other people

1:43:02.480 --> 1:43:04.520
 that take stuff more personally.

1:43:04.520 --> 1:43:07.160
 This has to do with teams and figuring out like,

1:43:07.160 --> 1:43:09.640
 okay, who's going to take certain words personally

1:43:09.640 --> 1:43:10.920
 and not, and you have to know.

1:43:10.920 --> 1:43:13.600
 That's what makes a great coach, a great leader,

1:43:13.600 --> 1:43:16.960
 a mentor, you have to like factor all that in.

1:43:16.960 --> 1:43:19.800
 But it just, there's something about just being an asshole

1:43:19.800 --> 1:43:23.800
 and being passionate and really driven

1:43:23.800 --> 1:43:26.920
 that sometimes you do cross lines.

1:43:26.920 --> 1:43:30.280
 And that's, I don't know what to do with that

1:43:30.280 --> 1:43:32.640
 because it feels like it comes with the territory.

1:43:32.640 --> 1:43:36.240
 Like you have, it seems like you can't just have

1:43:36.240 --> 1:43:38.840
 a perfectly optimized.

1:43:38.840 --> 1:43:41.120
 No, no, absolutely not.

1:43:41.120 --> 1:43:41.960
 We're humans.

1:43:41.960 --> 1:43:42.800
 Yeah.

1:43:42.800 --> 1:43:43.840
 We're humans, we don't have a program.

1:43:43.840 --> 1:43:46.320
 Everyone's programmed the same way to react the same way

1:43:46.320 --> 1:43:48.080
 to given stimulus, right?

1:43:48.080 --> 1:43:48.920
 Yeah.

1:43:48.920 --> 1:43:52.480
 So, you know, you said, I don't know

1:43:52.480 --> 1:43:53.800
 if this was a real example, but you said,

1:43:53.800 --> 1:43:56.560
 oh, you're the dumbest human on earth or whatever.

1:43:56.560 --> 1:43:58.560
 I would never say that.

1:43:58.560 --> 1:44:00.000
 Absolutely never.

1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:02.800
 And if someone said that to me or I saw someone else say

1:44:02.800 --> 1:44:06.160
 that to another person on the team, absolutely not.

1:44:06.160 --> 1:44:08.640
 That is not allowed because that's judging someone.

1:44:08.640 --> 1:44:10.680
 You may be heated and you can get heated

1:44:10.680 --> 1:44:12.760
 and you can say it in your intonation,

1:44:12.760 --> 1:44:15.240
 but to then try to put a label on it

1:44:15.240 --> 1:44:17.920
 and put a label on a person, that is not allowed.

1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:20.560
 So if you let that kind of culture happen

1:44:20.560 --> 1:44:25.560
 and it becomes somewhat, you know, sometimes it's ingest,

1:44:26.240 --> 1:44:28.000
 you know, it has to be very much ingest

1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:29.040
 and those two people have to have

1:44:29.040 --> 1:44:31.640
 a really good working relationship.

1:44:31.640 --> 1:44:33.280
 But other than that, I'm sorry,

1:44:33.280 --> 1:44:37.480
 it's gonna be a lot more, you could say a septic

1:44:37.480 --> 1:44:39.720
 in that way that you're not gonna add that stuff in,

1:44:39.720 --> 1:44:42.280
 but you can do it with all other types of ways

1:44:42.280 --> 1:44:45.480
 without saying that because then people who do react

1:44:45.480 --> 1:44:48.480
 to that kind of language and don't have those shields

1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:51.720
 because they might not have that stream confidence level

1:44:51.720 --> 1:44:54.360
 that you do and you can just brush it off,

1:44:54.360 --> 1:44:56.960
 that can be very cancerous in a team

1:44:56.960 --> 1:44:59.680
 because people then mean that and then they see,

1:44:59.680 --> 1:45:01.240
 oh, that's the right way to be.

1:45:01.240 --> 1:45:04.240
 You gotta snuff that out and you gotta be that,

1:45:04.240 --> 1:45:06.200
 you gotta be that change or that model

1:45:06.200 --> 1:45:08.000
 that you wanna show the team.

1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:10.680
 Yes, it's too, even if it doesn't affect me,

1:45:10.680 --> 1:45:14.200
 it's going to affect a significant enough fraction

1:45:14.200 --> 1:45:17.480
 of brilliant people where that shouldn't be part

1:45:17.480 --> 1:45:18.320
 of the culture.

1:45:18.320 --> 1:45:20.200
 Exactly, and other people see that happen

1:45:20.200 --> 1:45:22.720
 and then, oh, I guess that's acceptable, right?

1:45:22.720 --> 1:45:24.600
 Just like politics in the workplace,

1:45:24.600 --> 1:45:26.120
 is that acceptable or not?

1:45:26.120 --> 1:45:29.160
 I call it out exactly when I see it in front of everyone,

1:45:29.160 --> 1:45:32.800
 right, because it's just another ego driven thing.

1:45:32.800 --> 1:45:35.640
 You have to set the tone as a leader

1:45:35.640 --> 1:45:37.600
 for what you want your organization to be

1:45:37.600 --> 1:45:39.800
 and how it gets reflected in the world

1:45:39.800 --> 1:45:42.000
 and you have to uphold that and you can't,

1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:44.840
 sure, you can have an excursion outside of that,

1:45:44.840 --> 1:45:47.080
 but you have to go back and say, I'm sorry.

1:45:47.080 --> 1:45:49.040
 Yeah, yeah.

1:45:49.040 --> 1:45:51.320
 You have to go and apologize, heal and said,

1:45:51.320 --> 1:45:53.640
 I was not the person I wanted to be that day,

1:45:53.640 --> 1:45:55.160
 I'm really sorry.

1:45:55.160 --> 1:45:56.000
 Yeah.

1:45:56.000 --> 1:45:58.200
 This is, and even in front of the team

1:45:58.200 --> 1:46:00.720
 and have that humility and say, we're all human here

1:46:00.720 --> 1:46:01.680
 and just cause I'm the leader

1:46:01.680 --> 1:46:03.400
 doesn't mean I don't make mistakes.

1:46:03.400 --> 1:46:06.560
 So have the self awareness, apologize.

1:46:06.560 --> 1:46:07.720
 Exactly.

1:46:07.720 --> 1:46:10.240
 And that's also part of the culture.

1:46:11.480 --> 1:46:12.320
 Oh yeah.

1:46:12.320 --> 1:46:16.840
 How are you different from Steve as a leader and designer?

1:46:16.840 --> 1:46:20.320
 So you've spoken about sort of what made you strong,

1:46:20.320 --> 1:46:22.120
 which is he was able to challenge,

1:46:22.120 --> 1:46:26.040
 he was able to push you to bring out the best.

1:46:26.040 --> 1:46:28.640
 Well, I come from the technical angle, right?

1:46:28.640 --> 1:46:33.200
 Deep technology, software, hardware, systems thinking,

1:46:33.200 --> 1:46:34.520
 implementation, all that stuff.

1:46:34.520 --> 1:46:36.240
 So I have a different bent.

1:46:36.240 --> 1:46:38.720
 He wanted to be an engineer, started,

1:46:38.720 --> 1:46:40.880
 but really he was much better at all the other things,

1:46:40.880 --> 1:46:43.440
 the storytelling, the interfacing

1:46:43.440 --> 1:46:45.680
 and being the voice of the customer

1:46:45.680 --> 1:46:47.920
 and being that product marketer in a way, right?

1:46:47.920 --> 1:46:49.120
 That we talked about.

1:46:49.120 --> 1:46:51.480
 I grew into being the product marketing, then marketing.

1:46:51.480 --> 1:46:53.880
 He came really out the other way, right?

1:46:53.880 --> 1:46:55.520
 And never got really deep technically.

1:46:55.520 --> 1:46:57.560
 So that's two different mindsets.

1:46:57.560 --> 1:46:58.760
 One's not better or worse.

1:46:58.760 --> 1:47:00.120
 It's just, that's how it is.

1:47:00.120 --> 1:47:05.000
 And it takes all kinds and all kinds can do great designs.

1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:06.640
 Did it manifest itself differently?

1:47:06.640 --> 1:47:09.960
 Just the fact that you came from those different places.

1:47:09.960 --> 1:47:10.800
 Absolutely.

1:47:10.800 --> 1:47:15.000
 Like what, so like the discussion about glass on the iPhone

1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:17.160
 was probably had a different flavor to it.

1:47:17.160 --> 1:47:18.000
 Sure.

1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:20.320
 When you started getting into the technical details,

1:47:20.320 --> 1:47:23.280
 enough so you're getting the third order technical details

1:47:23.280 --> 1:47:25.680
 and he can't argue with that anymore.

1:47:25.680 --> 1:47:27.960
 Then with somebody he's like, okay.

1:47:27.960 --> 1:47:30.880
 At some point he's like, I can't win this war.

1:47:30.880 --> 1:47:32.760
 And he learned that very early on

1:47:32.760 --> 1:47:36.040
 because he didn't like the way the look of the Macintosh

1:47:36.960 --> 1:47:39.480
 board, the PCB was laid out.

1:47:39.480 --> 1:47:41.520
 He wanted it to be beautiful on the outside

1:47:41.520 --> 1:47:42.480
 and on the inside.

1:47:42.480 --> 1:47:44.920
 He's like, why are all these wires running this way?

1:47:44.920 --> 1:47:47.240
 Why doesn't it have all this symmetry?

1:47:47.240 --> 1:47:49.520
 And we have to make it beautiful on the inside.

1:47:49.520 --> 1:47:52.120
 And even the traces on the boards

1:47:52.120 --> 1:47:53.560
 have to look a certain way.

1:47:53.560 --> 1:47:56.560
 So the teams made the board they knew that would work.

1:47:56.560 --> 1:47:59.680
 And then they made the board that the way Steve wanted it.

1:47:59.680 --> 1:48:01.000
 And that didn't work.

1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:03.880
 And then Steve instantly figured out like at some point

1:48:03.880 --> 1:48:05.960
 don't micromanage every single detail.

1:48:05.960 --> 1:48:07.760
 There's some things he doesn't know enough about.

1:48:07.760 --> 1:48:09.040
 And so he would get out of that.

1:48:09.040 --> 1:48:11.200
 But that was one of those instances

1:48:11.200 --> 1:48:13.320
 where he pushed really hard and that's his opinion.

1:48:13.320 --> 1:48:14.480
 So they said, okay, we're gonna make it

1:48:14.480 --> 1:48:16.680
 a data driven decision and we're gonna make both.

1:48:16.680 --> 1:48:18.960
 I'm gonna show you the results, right?

1:48:18.960 --> 1:48:21.440
 And then from there, he didn't get into those details.

1:48:21.440 --> 1:48:25.160
 So from that, you could have a great challenge, right?

1:48:25.160 --> 1:48:26.680
 Cause then you could get those data and say,

1:48:26.680 --> 1:48:27.560
 we can't do that.

1:48:27.560 --> 1:48:29.560
 And let me show you why, or we can do that.

1:48:29.560 --> 1:48:31.080
 And then Steve would go, you can't do that.

1:48:31.080 --> 1:48:32.000
 And you're like, oh, we can do that.

1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:33.120
 Let me show you, right?

1:48:33.120 --> 1:48:34.800
 So there's certain times when you were like

1:48:34.800 --> 1:48:36.400
 bringing something to reality

1:48:36.400 --> 1:48:39.280
 that he didn't think could exist, right?

1:48:39.280 --> 1:48:42.760
 So it was always that creative tension,

1:48:42.760 --> 1:48:46.240
 that interaction that was so successful, right?

1:48:46.240 --> 1:48:48.440
 I think, but there was one other fundamental thing

1:48:48.440 --> 1:48:51.840
 that was different and that it graded on the team

1:48:52.920 --> 1:48:56.480
 and that I made sure and I learned from to not do.

1:48:56.480 --> 1:49:00.640
 And I maybe overdue now in the opposite direction,

1:49:00.640 --> 1:49:04.640
 which is when there's a great idea that comes from the team,

1:49:04.640 --> 1:49:07.840
 acknowledge that person and go, that is a great idea.

1:49:07.840 --> 1:49:11.040
 As the leader, the opinion driven, that's a great idea.

1:49:11.040 --> 1:49:11.920
 Let's build on that.

1:49:11.920 --> 1:49:13.160
 Let's see if that can do that.

1:49:13.160 --> 1:49:15.480
 Or it's a great idea, but not for now, put it aside.

1:49:15.480 --> 1:49:17.880
 But call out when people have great ideas

1:49:17.880 --> 1:49:19.360
 because it's infectious.

1:49:19.360 --> 1:49:21.800
 And that means maybe not ideas that come bubble up

1:49:21.800 --> 1:49:24.440
 to the customer level, but inside the organization.

1:49:24.440 --> 1:49:26.320
 People like they get rewarded for their ideas

1:49:26.320 --> 1:49:27.760
 and say, that's a great one.

1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:32.880
 Steve was always like, you give an idea

1:49:32.880 --> 1:49:37.400
 and he would go, okay, I don't know.

1:49:37.400 --> 1:49:38.960
 The next day, 24 hours later,

1:49:38.960 --> 1:49:40.840
 it would come back with slight modifications.

1:49:40.840 --> 1:49:43.840
 I've had this genius idea, right?

1:49:43.840 --> 1:49:46.760
 And it's sooner or later we'd look around the table

1:49:46.760 --> 1:49:49.280
 and we'd like roll our eyes and go, here we go again.

1:49:49.280 --> 1:49:53.360
 So it demotivates you from generating ideas a little bit.

1:49:53.360 --> 1:49:55.080
 Well, we got used to it,

1:49:55.080 --> 1:49:59.640
 but later on in the team, it was just not,

1:49:59.640 --> 1:50:02.160
 it doesn't want to bring the best, right?

1:50:02.160 --> 1:50:05.760
 Cause if you're always like, the reaction is never,

1:50:05.760 --> 1:50:07.600
 that's a genius idea.

1:50:07.600 --> 1:50:11.240
 It was always like, it was either negative or neutral.

1:50:12.360 --> 1:50:13.200
 Right?

1:50:13.200 --> 1:50:15.840
 Then it doesn't have that same emotional effect

1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:17.840
 that you want you to bring your best.

1:50:17.840 --> 1:50:19.880
 Yeah, sometimes it's fun when people get excited

1:50:19.880 --> 1:50:21.040
 by just, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:50:21.040 --> 1:50:23.240
 You kind of build on top excitement.

1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:25.880
 It could be, but coupled with sort of harshness

1:50:25.880 --> 1:50:28.840
 when the idea is bad and you call out the bad ideas too.

1:50:28.840 --> 1:50:30.760
 So it's the good and the bad.

1:50:30.760 --> 1:50:33.920
 Oh, you could say, you don't have to say bad idea.

1:50:33.920 --> 1:50:35.560
 You say, maybe not now.

1:50:35.560 --> 1:50:37.000
 Let's table that for later.

1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:40.520
 Let's discuss it or say, that's a decent idea.

1:50:40.520 --> 1:50:42.120
 But did you think about that idea this way?

1:50:42.120 --> 1:50:43.840
 Not just no or yes,

1:50:43.840 --> 1:50:46.880
 but let's talk about why that might not be applicable

1:50:46.880 --> 1:50:48.920
 in this case so that they can learn.

1:50:48.920 --> 1:50:50.760
 So the next time they bring the next idea,

1:50:50.760 --> 1:50:52.440
 they can modulate and understand

1:50:52.440 --> 1:50:55.040
 to start seeing through the opinion based decision makers

1:50:55.040 --> 1:50:56.160
 or the databases to bring it

1:50:56.160 --> 1:50:59.480
 and bring better formatted arguments or ideas

1:50:59.480 --> 1:51:02.320
 so that you have better chance of success the next time.

1:51:02.320 --> 1:51:03.160
 Yeah. Right?

1:51:03.160 --> 1:51:04.880
 You got to train through those moments.

1:51:04.880 --> 1:51:07.360
 You got to teach, those are teaching moments.

1:51:07.360 --> 1:51:08.800
 Teaching moments.

1:51:08.800 --> 1:51:10.760
 I aspire to be that kind of person.

1:51:10.760 --> 1:51:14.480
 I'll usually just say that idea is shit.

1:51:14.480 --> 1:51:18.320
 That is the like, and then you,

1:51:18.320 --> 1:51:21.080
 I remember that this brilliant person

1:51:21.080 --> 1:51:23.080
 just gave that really shitty idea.

1:51:23.080 --> 1:51:24.640
 So I remember to make sure the next time

1:51:24.640 --> 1:51:27.360
 they give a good idea, I really compliment that good idea.

1:51:27.360 --> 1:51:32.080
 But I personally, I mean, it's emotion,

1:51:32.080 --> 1:51:34.680
 but I call out the really shitty ideas.

1:51:34.680 --> 1:51:36.520
 But you should call it the really great ones.

1:51:36.520 --> 1:51:38.200
 If you let the pendulum swing both ways,

1:51:38.200 --> 1:51:40.080
 then everybody goes, he's balanced.

1:51:40.080 --> 1:51:42.000
 It's always one way.

1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:43.680
 Why bring any idea?

1:51:43.680 --> 1:51:45.120
 I'm all about the pendulum.

1:51:45.120 --> 1:51:46.320
 Right?

1:51:46.320 --> 1:51:51.240
 You got to have both, the joy and the pain.

1:51:51.240 --> 1:51:53.880
 Don't you give me pain all the time.

1:51:53.880 --> 1:51:55.840
 So you mentioned the glass and the iPhone.

1:51:55.840 --> 1:51:59.000
 So you wanted to, not just the iPod, not just Nest.

1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:00.480
 You were one of the key figures

1:52:00.480 --> 1:52:02.000
 in the creation of the iPhone.

1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:03.720
 What's the interesting aspects?

1:52:03.720 --> 1:52:05.520
 What's the good, the bad, and the ugly

1:52:05.520 --> 1:52:07.440
 of the origin story of the iPhone?

1:52:08.560 --> 1:52:10.640
 Again, this is a Netflix series

1:52:10.640 --> 1:52:13.480
 that spans multiple seasons.

1:52:13.480 --> 1:52:14.480
 Change my flight, please.

1:52:14.480 --> 1:52:18.320
 Yeah, what was the, what interesting memories

1:52:18.320 --> 1:52:19.440
 you have from the finding?

1:52:19.440 --> 1:52:24.440
 So the pain and the joy that was foundational

1:52:25.840 --> 1:52:30.840
 to the iPod, all the CDs you had to lug around.

1:52:33.160 --> 1:52:36.320
 What was the pain and the joy and the vision

1:52:36.320 --> 1:52:39.880
 of the iPhone in your mind, in the mind of the team,

1:52:39.880 --> 1:52:42.080
 in Steve's mind, and so on?

1:52:42.080 --> 1:52:44.360
 Well, you know, there's multiple pains.

1:52:44.360 --> 1:52:46.440
 You have to also look, there's not just customer pain,

1:52:46.440 --> 1:52:48.720
 but there's business pain, okay?

1:52:48.720 --> 1:52:52.520
 And it's about the, so Apple now is getting out

1:52:52.520 --> 1:52:54.440
 of that place where it was in 2001.

1:52:54.440 --> 1:52:56.480
 Now people are starting to pay attention.

1:52:56.480 --> 1:52:58.440
 Apple's starting to get in the culture again.

1:52:58.440 --> 1:53:00.160
 It's becoming relevant.

1:53:00.160 --> 1:53:01.760
 Cash is starting to flow.

1:53:01.760 --> 1:53:06.560
 iPod is 60% of that, of the revenue,

1:53:06.560 --> 1:53:10.560
 total revenue of Apple doing an 85% market share.

1:53:10.560 --> 1:53:11.960
 You're starting to get a wind at your back.

1:53:11.960 --> 1:53:13.080
 You got confidence.

1:53:13.080 --> 1:53:15.920
 Like Apple had been beaten down since probably

1:53:15.920 --> 1:53:18.720
 the first time the Mac was, since the Mac,

1:53:18.720 --> 1:53:21.520
 it was a beaten company ever since the Mac.

1:53:21.520 --> 1:53:25.320
 So we're talking 15 years at that point, right?

1:53:25.320 --> 1:53:27.840
 This is the first time you're seeing like,

1:53:27.840 --> 1:53:30.920
 and Steve would proudly came in front of us and said,

1:53:31.880 --> 1:53:34.520
 today I can tell you all of the employees,

1:53:34.520 --> 1:53:36.000
 we are now out of debt.

1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:38.200
 We paid off our debt.

1:53:38.200 --> 1:53:42.360
 It was a joyous moment for him, right?

1:53:42.360 --> 1:53:43.680
 And then ultimately for our team

1:53:43.680 --> 1:53:47.720
 because no more debt, wonderful, right?

1:53:47.720 --> 1:53:50.520
 So now what you have is you have this successful thing

1:53:50.520 --> 1:53:55.160
 changing the face of Apple and you hear these

1:53:55.160 --> 1:53:59.880
 heavy stomping footsteps of the mobile phone industry.

1:53:59.880 --> 1:54:01.040
 Boom.

1:54:01.040 --> 1:54:03.360
 And it's the feature phones at that time.

1:54:03.360 --> 1:54:04.520
 They're adding cameras.

1:54:04.520 --> 1:54:06.240
 They're adding color displays.

1:54:06.240 --> 1:54:08.800
 They're seeing the success of the iPod and going,

1:54:08.800 --> 1:54:12.840
 that's just music, we have some storage.

1:54:12.840 --> 1:54:15.160
 We can load music on our phones

1:54:15.160 --> 1:54:18.120
 and we can do what the iPod does plus more.

1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:22.400
 Boom, boom, boom, right?

1:54:22.400 --> 1:54:25.520
 And you're like, and how many hundreds of millions

1:54:25.520 --> 1:54:27.160
 of them are being sold at that point?

1:54:27.160 --> 1:54:29.080
 It wasn't billions yet, but it was still,

1:54:29.080 --> 1:54:31.400
 a hundred million, 200 million a year.

1:54:31.400 --> 1:54:32.400
 iPod hadn't gotten there.

1:54:32.400 --> 1:54:36.680
 It was for 20, 40, 50 million, something like that.

1:54:36.680 --> 1:54:37.760
 So now you're like, okay,

1:54:37.760 --> 1:54:41.240
 what are we gonna do about this Goliath

1:54:41.240 --> 1:54:44.600
 who wants to take our lunch, right?

1:54:44.600 --> 1:54:46.520
 The schoolyard bully.

1:54:46.520 --> 1:54:50.120
 And so there was one, let's partner with them.

1:54:51.480 --> 1:54:54.320
 So iTunes music store was there.

1:54:54.320 --> 1:54:57.000
 All of these phones are gonna need music

1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:00.760
 so they can come to the iTunes music store

1:55:00.760 --> 1:55:02.200
 and get that music for those phones

1:55:02.200 --> 1:55:04.400
 because it wasn't just about the hardware player

1:55:04.400 --> 1:55:05.360
 at that point.

1:55:05.360 --> 1:55:07.600
 It was about the software that you need on the desktop

1:55:07.600 --> 1:55:10.080
 and the content that you needed to download.

1:55:10.080 --> 1:55:12.640
 So now Apple had multiple legs of the stool

1:55:12.640 --> 1:55:14.720
 as Steve would always refer to it.

1:55:14.720 --> 1:55:16.680
 So now the mobile phone industry,

1:55:16.680 --> 1:55:18.920
 okay, we're gonna work with them.

1:55:18.920 --> 1:55:22.600
 They are going to make an iPod shuffle basically

1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:27.120
 inside of a phone, can have 99 songs total.

1:55:27.120 --> 1:55:29.560
 And they're gonna come to our store and you're gonna,

1:55:29.560 --> 1:55:31.200
 I was like, okay, great.

1:55:31.200 --> 1:55:32.240
 It's all gonna be well and good.

1:55:32.240 --> 1:55:35.040
 And that became the Motorola rocker project.

1:55:35.040 --> 1:55:38.400
 It was Apple and Motorola getting together.

1:55:38.400 --> 1:55:41.280
 There's gonna be software on this smartphone

1:55:41.280 --> 1:55:43.080
 or not smartphone, but feature phone

1:55:43.080 --> 1:55:45.480
 to hook to iTunes to get your music.

1:55:45.480 --> 1:55:47.760
 It wasn't even downloadable over a cloud or anything

1:55:47.760 --> 1:55:49.160
 because that wasn't available yet.

1:55:49.160 --> 1:55:51.600
 There wasn't data networks yet.

1:55:54.320 --> 1:55:56.520
 It was a disaster from the beginning.

1:55:56.520 --> 1:55:58.120
 Two different cultures,

1:55:58.120 --> 1:56:01.200
 two different types of leadership styles,

1:56:01.200 --> 1:56:03.080
 not necessarily the most competent engineers

1:56:03.080 --> 1:56:06.080
 on the other side.

1:56:06.080 --> 1:56:10.360
 And it turned out to be an absolute horrible disaster.

1:56:10.360 --> 1:56:11.400
 I watched the pains,

1:56:11.400 --> 1:56:12.800
 cause luckily I didn't have to be part of it.

1:56:12.800 --> 1:56:14.600
 I watched the pains on Jeff Robbins face

1:56:14.600 --> 1:56:15.520
 each time we would meet.

1:56:15.520 --> 1:56:20.520
 And he would be like, these guys are just like, really?

1:56:20.640 --> 1:56:21.960
 Do we have to do this, Steve?

1:56:21.960 --> 1:56:24.120
 And he's like, we're contractually obligated.

1:56:24.120 --> 1:56:26.720
 And when it came out on stage and Steve showed it,

1:56:26.720 --> 1:56:28.760
 it was maybe a one minute,

1:56:28.760 --> 1:56:31.560
 Steve loves those extended, like drawn up.

1:56:31.560 --> 1:56:33.560
 It might've been a one minute, two minute kind of thing.

1:56:33.560 --> 1:56:35.600
 And he literally threw that phone out of his hand

1:56:35.600 --> 1:56:37.400
 as fast as he could, right?

1:56:37.400 --> 1:56:38.240
 Cause it was horrible.

1:56:38.240 --> 1:56:41.480
 So there was the pain of we're not gonna partner.

1:56:41.480 --> 1:56:43.400
 So if we can't partner with these guys,

1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:47.400
 we have to become one of them to actually compete,

1:56:47.400 --> 1:56:49.840
 to save the thing that is bringing Apple

1:56:49.840 --> 1:56:53.200
 from that 15 years of malaise, right?

1:56:54.760 --> 1:56:59.760
 So then from that, we were made a prototype

1:56:59.760 --> 1:57:04.600
 of an iPod plus phone, a classic with it was an iPod,

1:57:04.600 --> 1:57:06.760
 but it had a phone inside with all the music

1:57:06.760 --> 1:57:07.600
 and all the other stuff.

1:57:07.600 --> 1:57:09.280
 And you use your headset,

1:57:09.280 --> 1:57:12.800
 wired headset to do the audio, right?

1:57:12.800 --> 1:57:15.600
 There was another project at the same time

1:57:15.600 --> 1:57:19.760
 cause we were doing videos in the iTunes music store,

1:57:19.760 --> 1:57:23.120
 iTunes video store for music videos and movies.

1:57:24.400 --> 1:57:26.760
 And it would be a full screen iPod.

1:57:26.760 --> 1:57:29.200
 So instead of the classic, the way you know it,

1:57:29.200 --> 1:57:31.720
 but it would be full screen

1:57:31.720 --> 1:57:34.160
 and it would have a virtual click wheel.

1:57:34.160 --> 1:57:36.760
 You'd have a virtual, like single touch touchscreen

1:57:36.760 --> 1:57:38.760
 that you could scroll, right?

1:57:38.760 --> 1:57:41.960
 Think of maybe an iPhone, like you knew it, right?

1:57:41.960 --> 1:57:44.360
 And then there was a third project going on,

1:57:44.360 --> 1:57:46.440
 not in, those two were going on in my team,

1:57:46.440 --> 1:57:48.360
 but the third project going on

1:57:48.360 --> 1:57:52.160
 was the multi touchscreen technology

1:57:52.160 --> 1:57:55.920
 to drive a Mac tablet.

1:57:55.920 --> 1:58:00.920
 And so that Mac tablet, that touchscreen technology,

1:58:00.920 --> 1:58:02.560
 there was just way too much you had to change

1:58:02.560 --> 1:58:04.520
 on the software and everything

1:58:04.520 --> 1:58:06.480
 to be able to use a tablet, right?

1:58:06.480 --> 1:58:07.320
 We see this all the time.

1:58:07.320 --> 1:58:09.320
 Like people are like, there's not enough tablet apps today

1:58:09.320 --> 1:58:10.640
 that are modified for tablet.

1:58:10.640 --> 1:58:12.920
 They're just phone apps that are grown up, right?

1:58:12.920 --> 1:58:15.560
 So then they would just be Mac touch stuff.

1:58:15.560 --> 1:58:17.960
 So you'd have to have a whole developer community.

1:58:17.960 --> 1:58:19.720
 That probably wasn't the best place

1:58:19.720 --> 1:58:21.560
 to take that technology first.

1:58:21.560 --> 1:58:23.120
 So you take that technology,

1:58:23.120 --> 1:58:24.360
 marry it with the full screen,

1:58:24.360 --> 1:58:26.920
 that technology, marry it with the full screen iPod

1:58:26.920 --> 1:58:28.360
 and the phone stuff we were working

1:58:28.360 --> 1:58:31.040
 because the iPod phone with a rotary dial

1:58:31.040 --> 1:58:32.600
 was just like a rotary phone.

1:58:32.600 --> 1:58:35.920
 We couldn't make that interface work well for data input.

1:58:37.440 --> 1:58:38.720
 You put those three together.

1:58:38.720 --> 1:58:41.080
 And now is where those three things

1:58:41.080 --> 1:58:44.840
 that then created the form or the technology

1:58:44.840 --> 1:58:48.480
 and the form inside what would become the iPhone,

1:58:48.480 --> 1:58:51.840
 married with a bunch of low level software

1:58:51.840 --> 1:58:54.560
 from the iPod and manufacturing software

1:58:54.560 --> 1:58:57.440
 and drivers and communication stuff,

1:58:57.440 --> 1:59:02.440
 combined with a very reduced Frankenstein Mac OS.

1:59:03.440 --> 1:59:06.000
 And I mean that in the best way.

1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:09.040
 It means it wasn't Mac OS just changed a little.

1:59:09.040 --> 1:59:11.480
 It was totally, things were hacked out and changed

1:59:11.480 --> 1:59:13.280
 and new code was inserted.

1:59:13.280 --> 1:59:16.560
 And it really was a whole set of things

1:59:16.560 --> 1:59:20.480
 from all different places to make that first iPhone OS.

1:59:20.480 --> 1:59:23.360
 And then there was another team working on the apps

1:59:23.360 --> 1:59:25.000
 and then another team working on the design

1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:27.600
 of how it looked overall between all that stuff.

1:59:27.600 --> 1:59:29.400
 So all of those things came together

1:59:29.400 --> 1:59:32.840
 to create what we know as the first generation iPhone.

1:59:32.840 --> 1:59:34.800
 And those are all probably fascinating

1:59:34.800 --> 1:59:36.160
 engineering challenges.

1:59:36.160 --> 1:59:37.000
 Correct.

1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:41.440
 And great teams like creating the Frankenstein OS.

1:59:42.480 --> 1:59:45.200
 That's fascinating because you're simplifying and simplifying

1:59:45.200 --> 1:59:47.200
 but then you're just pulling different stuff from,

1:59:47.200 --> 1:59:49.520
 and you're basically inventing,

1:59:49.520 --> 1:59:51.280
 I mean, they're probably not thinking of it that way,

1:59:51.280 --> 1:59:56.040
 but a new era of computing, a new kind of computer.

1:59:56.040 --> 1:59:57.280
 It really is Frankenstein.

1:59:57.280 --> 1:59:59.640
 Right, and you didn't have to run Mac software.

1:59:59.640 --> 2:00:02.280
 If you look at some of the other smartphones of the time,

2:00:02.280 --> 2:00:04.960
 like Windows and stuff, they were like,

2:00:04.960 --> 2:00:06.880
 we need to make sure it runs Excel

2:00:06.880 --> 2:00:08.760
 and it runs Word or something like that

2:00:08.760 --> 2:00:09.920
 in some reduced thing.

2:00:09.920 --> 2:00:11.040
 This was like, no, no, no, no.

2:00:11.040 --> 2:00:12.760
 This was born out of entertainment.

2:00:12.760 --> 2:00:15.840
 So we didn't have to go and take all the same application,

2:00:15.840 --> 2:00:19.240
 you know, all those other ones was about compatibility.

2:00:19.240 --> 2:00:21.760
 This was about a whole new way of being.

2:00:21.760 --> 2:00:26.560
 What did you think about the Steve Jobs presentation

2:00:26.560 --> 2:00:31.560
 of the iPhone, the sort of, the first iPhone, you know.

2:00:31.760 --> 2:00:34.480
 Phone, internet communicator, and the iPod in your pocket.

2:00:34.480 --> 2:00:36.840
 Yeah, that you're going to sort of present,

2:00:38.040 --> 2:00:41.320
 announcing three new products kind of thing

2:00:41.320 --> 2:00:43.280
 and then saying that it's all in one.

2:00:43.280 --> 2:00:44.920
 Just, this is a good example,

2:00:44.920 --> 2:00:49.920
 one of the sort of historic presentations of a product.

2:00:52.520 --> 2:00:55.040
 Clearly there's like some showmanship that works,

2:00:55.040 --> 2:00:56.760
 some reason it works.

2:00:56.760 --> 2:00:59.560
 It doesn't always work, it often doesn't work,

2:00:59.560 --> 2:01:02.800
 but it did in this case, it often did for Steve.

2:01:02.800 --> 2:01:04.920
 What, like, how did that feel?

2:01:06.200 --> 2:01:11.200
 What part of the actually the design process

2:01:11.680 --> 2:01:13.440
 was that presentation?

2:01:13.440 --> 2:01:14.280
 You know what I mean?

2:01:14.280 --> 2:01:15.800
 In the early, because you said,

2:01:15.800 --> 2:01:17.960
 should consider the why, the press release

2:01:17.960 --> 2:01:19.400
 at the very beginning.

2:01:19.400 --> 2:01:21.240
 Steve was doing that the entire time.

2:01:21.240 --> 2:01:24.560
 He was working on that story from day one.

2:01:24.560 --> 2:01:27.320
 He was pitching us this, this, this, and then this.

2:01:27.320 --> 2:01:29.240
 And then he would look at our faces

2:01:29.240 --> 2:01:31.320
 because you wouldn't, most people wouldn't,

2:01:31.320 --> 2:01:32.720
 at least if you're working for him,

2:01:32.720 --> 2:01:34.200
 wouldn't tell him what you really thought

2:01:34.200 --> 2:01:36.920
 of what he was saying, but he would look at your faces.

2:01:36.920 --> 2:01:39.760
 And then he would talk to a few real trusted confidence

2:01:39.760 --> 2:01:44.120
 outside of the organization.

2:01:44.120 --> 2:01:45.880
 And see what they thought, right?

2:01:45.880 --> 2:01:47.560
 And they could give him feedback on it

2:01:47.560 --> 2:01:49.200
 and they could really challenge him,

2:01:49.200 --> 2:01:51.440
 but he would also look at their faces and go, hmm.

2:01:51.440 --> 2:01:53.800
 And so when you see that, hmm,

2:01:53.800 --> 2:01:56.160
 then he would modulate it and change it slightly

2:01:56.160 --> 2:01:57.000
 and change it.

2:01:57.000 --> 2:01:59.000
 So he was working during all of that time

2:01:59.000 --> 2:02:01.440
 on the story and the storytelling, right?

2:02:01.440 --> 2:02:03.920
 And the whys, while we're working on that

2:02:03.920 --> 2:02:04.840
 and helping us refine it,

2:02:04.840 --> 2:02:08.520
 just like the switch from plastic to glass, right?

2:02:08.520 --> 2:02:10.160
 All the time working on that.

2:02:10.160 --> 2:02:12.080
 So when he comes out on stage,

2:02:12.080 --> 2:02:15.680
 he does something that every marketer is told not to do.

2:02:15.680 --> 2:02:18.160
 Say these three things are now combined in one.

2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:23.000
 That is like the, they say that that is the laziest form

2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:26.760
 of storytelling possible for marketing, right?

2:02:26.760 --> 2:02:28.000
 Yeah. Right?

2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:31.240
 But it was the best one because it was all those pains.

2:02:31.240 --> 2:02:35.280
 It was like, I want my iPod, but I want my communications

2:02:35.280 --> 2:02:37.840
 and I want my internet browsing because I want it on the go

2:02:37.840 --> 2:02:40.720
 so I can look up things because it was information.

2:02:40.720 --> 2:02:42.800
 And when you were on the road, you had a laptop,

2:02:42.800 --> 2:02:45.680
 you had an iPod and you had a phone that,

2:02:45.680 --> 2:02:49.040
 and you had to carry all of these things with you at once.

2:02:49.040 --> 2:02:51.640
 Now we're gonna solve that pain for you

2:02:51.640 --> 2:02:52.960
 and put it all together.

2:02:52.960 --> 2:02:54.400
 So he was just showing you the pain

2:02:54.400 --> 2:02:55.840
 and beating that virus of doubt and going,

2:02:55.840 --> 2:02:57.800
 it's now in this one magical thing.

2:02:57.800 --> 2:03:00.800
 And he could come up and masterfully tell that story

2:03:00.800 --> 2:03:03.640
 because he told it almost every day

2:03:03.640 --> 2:03:06.680
 to all of these people inside very quietly.

2:03:06.680 --> 2:03:09.320
 And then it was just, right?

2:03:09.320 --> 2:03:12.400
 It was like a Tony award winning play

2:03:12.400 --> 2:03:14.640
 that had been worked on for 10 years.

2:03:14.640 --> 2:03:17.000
 But also the human came through, the timing.

2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:18.520
 It was all that, it was all of it.

2:03:18.520 --> 2:03:20.640
 And of course he was dramatic at certain points

2:03:20.640 --> 2:03:23.840
 and he would raise his voice and a wry smile

2:03:23.840 --> 2:03:24.680
 or whatever it was.

2:03:24.680 --> 2:03:25.520
 Right, that wry smile was magic.

2:03:25.520 --> 2:03:26.560
 It was all those touches.

2:03:26.560 --> 2:03:29.120
 He was an actor as well as a storyteller.

2:03:29.120 --> 2:03:29.960
 Yeah.

2:03:29.960 --> 2:03:32.640
 But it was the truth, right?

2:03:32.640 --> 2:03:33.960
 The truth came through.

2:03:33.960 --> 2:03:36.440
 It was a nonfiction story.

2:03:36.440 --> 2:03:39.800
 And then he added those personal flourishes on top of it

2:03:39.800 --> 2:03:41.120
 for dramatic effect.

2:03:42.880 --> 2:03:43.720
 It's amazing.

2:03:45.280 --> 2:03:50.280
 So there's a designer you mentioned, Johnny Ave.

2:03:51.840 --> 2:03:55.560
 You both are brilliant designers, great human beings.

2:03:55.560 --> 2:03:59.160
 There were some battles fought in the distant past

2:03:59.160 --> 2:04:00.520
 between the two of you.

2:04:01.440 --> 2:04:04.040
 Looking back, what is the positive characteristics

2:04:04.040 --> 2:04:07.120
 of Johnny that made you a better person and designer

2:04:07.120 --> 2:04:08.240
 having worked with him?

2:04:13.600 --> 2:04:18.600
 Watching the process that the design team that Johnny led.

2:04:20.160 --> 2:04:22.080
 I don't know where, cause that was over years.

2:04:22.080 --> 2:04:23.440
 I didn't see all of those things.

2:04:23.440 --> 2:04:26.200
 But watching the design process of really,

2:04:26.200 --> 2:04:29.880
 cause it was really a team that was about materials.

2:04:29.880 --> 2:04:31.360
 It was about form.

2:04:31.360 --> 2:04:32.680
 It was about colors.

2:04:32.680 --> 2:04:35.640
 It was about these physical characteristics.

2:04:36.760 --> 2:04:38.800
 When we talked about this earlier was design.

2:04:38.800 --> 2:04:39.640
 What is design?

2:04:39.640 --> 2:04:41.040
 Design's everywhere, okay?

2:04:41.040 --> 2:04:43.680
 So what they were really focused on was form,

2:04:44.560 --> 2:04:47.720
 how the feel was, how it looked, the aesthetics,

2:04:47.720 --> 2:04:49.120
 the physical aesthetics.

2:04:50.240 --> 2:04:53.200
 And watching, going through that process,

2:04:53.200 --> 2:04:58.200
 I learned so much in that process about how to do colors,

2:04:58.200 --> 2:05:03.200
 how to do materials, how to think deeply about curves,

2:05:05.960 --> 2:05:10.040
 and shadows, and how it would look, not just in your hand,

2:05:10.040 --> 2:05:12.120
 but how it would look in the photograph

2:05:12.120 --> 2:05:14.840
 you were gonna take for marketing, right?

2:05:14.840 --> 2:05:19.240
 So how it would look, how you would feel, all of it.

2:05:19.240 --> 2:05:23.640
 It was all of those physical things around that

2:05:23.640 --> 2:05:28.480
 and watching the process to get there,

2:05:28.480 --> 2:05:31.240
 that was enlightening for me, right?

2:05:31.240 --> 2:05:35.040
 It opened my mind to go, oh, okay.

2:05:35.040 --> 2:05:37.240
 Just like there's a process for all these other things,

2:05:37.240 --> 2:05:39.800
 it wasn't just magic and you say,

2:05:41.400 --> 2:05:42.680
 ha, ha, ha, there it is.

2:05:42.680 --> 2:05:44.800
 It was really a process of refinement,

2:05:44.800 --> 2:05:46.760
 you know, of opening the funnel at the beginning

2:05:46.760 --> 2:05:51.040
 and refining down over time to get to that final,

2:05:51.040 --> 2:05:53.760
 the final and selecting and doing the selection.

2:05:53.760 --> 2:05:55.120
 And certain types you could,

2:05:55.120 --> 2:05:58.920
 certain times there were opinion based design details.

2:05:58.920 --> 2:06:02.040
 But a lot of data, a lot of data driven designs

2:06:02.040 --> 2:06:05.400
 of what can we deliver in volume?

2:06:05.400 --> 2:06:06.600
 What can we do different things?

2:06:06.600 --> 2:06:08.680
 So you always had these constraints

2:06:08.680 --> 2:06:09.640
 that you had to work with under.

2:06:09.640 --> 2:06:13.040
 And sometimes they, and the team,

2:06:13.040 --> 2:06:14.840
 not just I, would say, we need this.

2:06:14.840 --> 2:06:16.920
 And we're like, we can't deliver that.

2:06:16.920 --> 2:06:18.760
 But maybe we were able to work together

2:06:18.760 --> 2:06:20.840
 to find different design characteristics

2:06:20.840 --> 2:06:23.320
 and different implementation characteristics

2:06:23.320 --> 2:06:25.520
 that could get to that point

2:06:25.520 --> 2:06:27.520
 without what they were describing.

2:06:27.520 --> 2:06:30.840
 And instead of yes, yes, yes, no, no, no,

2:06:30.840 --> 2:06:34.520
 let's find some other way to solve the problem together.

2:06:34.520 --> 2:06:39.520
 Yeah, is, and I've seen this in several companies

2:06:40.080 --> 2:06:43.480
 I've more closely interacted with, like Tesla is an example.

2:06:43.480 --> 2:06:46.400
 Sometimes, you know, talking about curves,

2:06:46.400 --> 2:06:51.160
 sometimes it's very painful on the engineering side

2:06:51.160 --> 2:06:55.400
 to deliver a very specific kind of thing.

2:06:55.400 --> 2:06:59.120
 And one question that comes up in my mind is like,

2:06:59.120 --> 2:07:02.920
 well, how far should we go to try to deliver

2:07:02.920 --> 2:07:06.920
 a tiny adjustment in a curve, in the curvature,

2:07:06.920 --> 2:07:10.400
 or in like whatever the form factor is,

2:07:10.400 --> 2:07:12.440
 or the color of the material,

2:07:12.440 --> 2:07:15.560
 when the cost is like 10X to deliver,

2:07:15.560 --> 2:07:17.760
 not financially, but just like in effort,

2:07:17.760 --> 2:07:20.800
 like how many problems to have to solve.

2:07:22.720 --> 2:07:26.400
 I don't know if you can say any wisdom to that,

2:07:26.400 --> 2:07:29.200
 because when you're thinking about curves,

2:07:29.200 --> 2:07:31.280
 you're designing in the space of ideas,

2:07:31.280 --> 2:07:34.320
 you're like platonic forms kind of thing,

2:07:34.320 --> 2:07:38.480
 not always grounded to like how much this is,

2:07:38.480 --> 2:07:40.960
 how much pain is gonna be involved in delivering this,

2:07:40.960 --> 2:07:44.200
 but that's as you should perhaps,

2:07:44.200 --> 2:07:47.400
 because then if you're always thinking about the pain

2:07:47.400 --> 2:07:51.240
 required to deliver this thing, you'll be too conservative,

2:07:51.240 --> 2:07:53.040
 you wouldn't do the wild ideas.

2:07:54.160 --> 2:07:57.080
 Right, exactly, but you have to understand again

2:07:57.080 --> 2:07:58.320
 the why behind it.

2:07:58.320 --> 2:08:01.680
 And at Nest, when we had limited resources,

2:08:02.840 --> 2:08:04.680
 you know, putting a screwdriver in the box,

2:08:04.680 --> 2:08:07.520
 a custom designed screwdriver in the box,

2:08:07.520 --> 2:08:10.040
 was born out of those experiences I had at Apple,

2:08:10.040 --> 2:08:12.440
 and seeing how you can create something

2:08:12.440 --> 2:08:15.200
 that's emotional, it's part of marketing,

2:08:15.200 --> 2:08:17.800
 and it's part of the product experience overall,

2:08:17.800 --> 2:08:20.360
 even though it seems extraneous.

2:08:20.360 --> 2:08:23.320
 I went back and made the design team,

2:08:23.320 --> 2:08:25.720
 and the mechanical team change some curves

2:08:25.720 --> 2:08:28.240
 on the Nest Protect, the smoke and CO detector

2:08:28.240 --> 2:08:32.000
 we did at Nest, after they had already tooled it.

2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:33.240
 And I said, they're saying these cost more,

2:08:33.240 --> 2:08:35.360
 I said, it doesn't look right.

2:08:35.360 --> 2:08:37.680
 There is a, but they're like, oh, well we had,

2:08:37.680 --> 2:08:39.280
 I said, no, you're gonna go back,

2:08:39.280 --> 2:08:40.440
 and you're gonna make that change,

2:08:40.440 --> 2:08:43.000
 I told you we needed to do it,

2:08:43.000 --> 2:08:45.520
 we had a better looking model, that is gonna get done,

2:08:45.520 --> 2:08:48.720
 I know it's gonna be a terrible cost to you,

2:08:48.720 --> 2:08:50.560
 but we already had this discussion,

2:08:50.560 --> 2:08:52.200
 and that's the way it's gonna have to be,

2:08:52.200 --> 2:08:55.000
 and I'm sorry, but it is what it is.

2:08:56.640 --> 2:08:58.880
 And you know, because it's better for the customer,

2:08:58.880 --> 2:09:00.040
 and it looks better in the pictures,

2:09:00.040 --> 2:09:00.880
 and all the other stuff.

2:09:00.880 --> 2:09:02.200
 And then we did it, and it was great,

2:09:02.200 --> 2:09:04.320
 and everyone agreed it was great at the end,

2:09:04.320 --> 2:09:05.720
 but it was pain to get there.

2:09:07.000 --> 2:09:09.120
 Those are where, those little details

2:09:09.120 --> 2:09:11.080
 are where the magic comes out, right?

2:09:11.080 --> 2:09:15.640
 And if you don't do, if you don't take those pains

2:09:15.640 --> 2:09:18.960
 and put in the love, the customer's gonna feel,

2:09:18.960 --> 2:09:20.760
 it's gonna, they're either gonna feel the pain,

2:09:20.760 --> 2:09:22.520
 or they're gonna feel the love,

2:09:22.520 --> 2:09:23.800
 if you put it in, right?

2:09:23.800 --> 2:09:26.960
 So it depends on how much time and effort

2:09:26.960 --> 2:09:28.360
 you wanna put into something,

2:09:28.360 --> 2:09:30.120
 and what really matters to you,

2:09:30.120 --> 2:09:32.480
 and so how you communicate what you do.

2:09:32.480 --> 2:09:34.120
 We're human beings after all,

2:09:34.120 --> 2:09:36.920
 is there something you've learned

2:09:36.920 --> 2:09:40.520
 from sort of the tensions that are natural,

2:09:40.520 --> 2:09:43.120
 or that happen in teams when they're passionate,

2:09:43.120 --> 2:09:45.440
 and they're trying to solve these problems?

2:09:45.440 --> 2:09:47.200
 Is that the way of life?

2:09:47.200 --> 2:09:49.800
 And there's the human drama.

2:09:49.800 --> 2:09:51.800
 Is that just, is that always going,

2:09:51.800 --> 2:09:54.280
 is that, it is what it is?

2:09:54.280 --> 2:09:55.520
 Is that make you better?

2:09:55.520 --> 2:09:58.880
 Actually, the drama, the tension between personalities,

2:09:58.880 --> 2:10:00.280
 and all that kind of stuff.

2:10:01.240 --> 2:10:04.440
 Look, a rollercoaster ride without ups and downs

2:10:04.440 --> 2:10:05.440
 is no fun.

2:10:05.440 --> 2:10:10.000
 It's the journey, it's the journey that brings,

2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:12.240
 it brings out the best in everyone.

2:10:12.240 --> 2:10:17.160
 We're forged, we're tempered by those experiences,

2:10:17.160 --> 2:10:19.720
 not all the ups, but also the downs,

2:10:19.720 --> 2:10:22.040
 and that's when you get the humanity and the connection,

2:10:22.040 --> 2:10:25.120
 and we can tell these stories till we're blue in the face,

2:10:25.120 --> 2:10:28.760
 and smile every time, because we did something together

2:10:28.760 --> 2:10:30.640
 that each of us couldn't do apart,

2:10:30.640 --> 2:10:32.120
 but when it comes together,

2:10:32.120 --> 2:10:34.000
 that's where all the emotions happen,

2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:36.640
 and that's where, if it's born out of the right reasons,

2:10:36.640 --> 2:10:38.520
 and the right story, and the right way,

2:10:38.520 --> 2:10:40.120
 that's where the magic happens,

2:10:40.120 --> 2:10:41.560
 not just for the customer,

2:10:41.560 --> 2:10:43.960
 but for how it transforms each person

2:10:43.960 --> 2:10:45.240
 who is working on it,

2:10:45.240 --> 2:10:48.400
 and they will never forget those experiences in their life,

2:10:48.400 --> 2:10:51.240
 positively and negatively, that happened at the time,

2:10:51.240 --> 2:10:53.680
 but they look back, and it's only positive,

2:10:53.680 --> 2:10:55.680
 because they did something that mattered.

2:10:56.600 --> 2:11:00.360
 Yet another brilliant idea that you brought to life

2:11:00.360 --> 2:11:05.360
 is Nest, Nest thermostats, and the big umbrella of Nest.

2:11:08.960 --> 2:11:13.040
 Again, as part of this Netflix series, season three,

2:11:14.400 --> 2:11:17.760
 what was the most memorable, the most painful,

2:11:17.760 --> 2:11:22.680
 the most insight leading challenge

2:11:22.680 --> 2:11:24.720
 you had to overcome to bring Nest to life?

2:11:24.720 --> 2:11:29.720
 Well, the first thing for me was making someone care

2:11:33.760 --> 2:11:35.560
 about their thermostat.

2:11:37.920 --> 2:11:39.560
 No one considers it.

2:11:39.560 --> 2:11:41.640
 They never had any customer choice.

2:11:41.640 --> 2:11:43.160
 They didn't install it.

2:11:43.160 --> 2:11:44.440
 They usually don't even use it,

2:11:44.440 --> 2:11:46.520
 because it's so complicated, or what have you,

2:11:46.520 --> 2:11:50.480
 they just, they bitch at it, they hide it in the corner,

2:11:50.480 --> 2:11:52.400
 and then they just pay the bill, right,

2:11:52.400 --> 2:11:54.240
 of whatever it is, right?

2:11:54.240 --> 2:11:58.120
 It's totally unloved, unconsidered, right?

2:11:58.120 --> 2:12:00.680
 So how do you wake up, like I said, the virus of doubt,

2:12:00.680 --> 2:12:03.400
 how do you wake that up and get people going,

2:12:03.400 --> 2:12:05.440
 remember every day when you go in and it's like,

2:12:05.440 --> 2:12:07.240
 you're just frustrated, and then you get the bill

2:12:07.240 --> 2:12:08.800
 and you pay the bill, so you have to do that.

2:12:08.800 --> 2:12:10.000
 So that was one thing.

2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:12.960
 I think the other big one was not delivering,

2:12:12.960 --> 2:12:14.040
 all of it was hard, right?

2:12:14.040 --> 2:12:16.280
 It was constrained, we had only so much stuff,

2:12:16.280 --> 2:12:19.080
 we were bootstrapped, we didn't have massive funding,

2:12:19.080 --> 2:12:21.200
 we didn't get hundreds of millions of dollars,

2:12:21.200 --> 2:12:22.360
 but we did it for the right reasons.

2:12:22.360 --> 2:12:25.440
 But I think the other big part of it was

2:12:25.440 --> 2:12:27.720
 not just building a disruptive product,

2:12:27.720 --> 2:12:29.680
 because a lot of the people on the team had done that,

2:12:29.680 --> 2:12:32.920
 we knew what we were doing, and that was,

2:12:32.920 --> 2:12:35.680
 if we got the design right, we could deliver it

2:12:36.640 --> 2:12:38.760
 with enough time.

2:12:40.560 --> 2:12:42.960
 It was getting the disruptive go to market,

2:12:42.960 --> 2:12:44.880
 in other words, how to take that product

2:12:44.880 --> 2:12:46.760
 from the end of the production line

2:12:46.760 --> 2:12:49.400
 and get it into the customer's hands,

2:12:49.400 --> 2:12:53.760
 because there was no retail or customer choice

2:12:53.760 --> 2:12:54.960
 in thermostats.

2:12:54.960 --> 2:12:57.760
 No one even, it was never considered purchase.

2:12:57.760 --> 2:13:00.040
 They never thought they had choice.

2:13:00.040 --> 2:13:03.400
 Some guy, usually in suspenders and a butt crack,

2:13:03.400 --> 2:13:05.920
 told them, looked around, looked at their house

2:13:05.920 --> 2:13:08.680
 and said, this looks like somebody who's got,

2:13:08.680 --> 2:13:09.920
 is well to do.

2:13:09.920 --> 2:13:13.080
 This thermostat is now gonna cost you $350,

2:13:13.080 --> 2:13:14.560
 thank you very much.

2:13:14.560 --> 2:13:17.120
 And you're like, I'll take whatever you give me, right?

2:13:17.120 --> 2:13:18.800
 And then it goes into another house,

2:13:18.800 --> 2:13:21.720
 it's worth $100, it was the same damn thing, right?

2:13:21.720 --> 2:13:23.320
 So there was no price transparency,

2:13:23.320 --> 2:13:26.640
 there was no choice, you just got what you were given.

2:13:26.640 --> 2:13:30.760
 So how do you go, and this was an entrenched industry,

2:13:30.760 --> 2:13:34.280
 that's why there was no innovation in it,

2:13:34.280 --> 2:13:35.600
 because it was doing just fine

2:13:35.600 --> 2:13:37.840
 because every house needed them.

2:13:37.840 --> 2:13:42.840
 All the installers were programmed by the product deliverers,

2:13:42.840 --> 2:13:48.840
 by bonuses to say, you're gonna only carry our product,

2:13:49.040 --> 2:13:50.200
 and if you sell this many,

2:13:50.200 --> 2:13:53.280
 you're gonna get a free trip to Hawaii, right?

2:13:53.280 --> 2:13:54.440
 And for these guys who install,

2:13:54.440 --> 2:13:57.840
 I get a free trip to Hawaii, that's dream for them, right?

2:13:57.840 --> 2:14:00.320
 So this whole channel was fully controlled

2:14:00.320 --> 2:14:01.560
 by the product guys,

2:14:01.560 --> 2:14:03.680
 and it was almost monopolistic in a way.

2:14:04.800 --> 2:14:06.760
 So how do you go around that?

2:14:06.760 --> 2:14:10.840
 So creating a disruptive go to market channel,

2:14:10.840 --> 2:14:13.000
 one was direct to consumer, right?

2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:15.600
 And all the marketing that was necessary

2:14:15.600 --> 2:14:17.800
 to get that message across.

2:14:17.800 --> 2:14:20.800
 Another one was getting the installation right.

2:14:21.800 --> 2:14:24.440
 No one was self installing thermostats.

2:14:24.440 --> 2:14:27.280
 So how do we get enough people who are early adopters

2:14:27.280 --> 2:14:30.600
 to be able to self install them confidently?

2:14:30.600 --> 2:14:32.880
 So they didn't still have to call the guy

2:14:32.880 --> 2:14:34.360
 to come and install it,

2:14:34.360 --> 2:14:36.280
 because then he would say, this is a crap product.

2:14:36.280 --> 2:14:38.360
 No, I got the most better product, right?

2:14:38.360 --> 2:14:40.680
 So you had to get rid of that friction.

2:14:40.680 --> 2:14:42.760
 And then ultimately, how do you get the people

2:14:42.760 --> 2:14:44.360
 who were not just early adopters,

2:14:44.360 --> 2:14:45.760
 but people who needed to see it

2:14:45.760 --> 2:14:47.480
 and touch it before they bought it?

2:14:47.480 --> 2:14:49.480
 How do you get that into retail

2:14:49.480 --> 2:14:53.120
 when the large brands of the time of thermostats

2:14:53.120 --> 2:14:55.640
 and Home Depot and Lowe's had contracts

2:14:55.640 --> 2:14:58.440
 that they couldn't bring in any other brands?

2:14:58.440 --> 2:15:00.320
 They were owning the channel all the way

2:15:00.320 --> 2:15:04.200
 to where there was any sort of slight customer choice.

2:15:04.200 --> 2:15:06.680
 And it was really contractor choice

2:15:06.680 --> 2:15:09.280
 more than it was in consumer choice.

2:15:09.280 --> 2:15:13.520
 So all of that had to be innovated along with the product.

2:15:13.520 --> 2:15:15.440
 And so to me, that was a huge challenge

2:15:15.440 --> 2:15:17.280
 and something I had never done,

2:15:17.280 --> 2:15:18.440
 most of us had never done.

2:15:18.440 --> 2:15:21.920
 And we had to create, that was as much as a project

2:15:21.920 --> 2:15:24.560
 as actually delivering the product itself.

2:15:25.960 --> 2:15:28.520
 So it turned out to be a giant hit.

2:15:28.520 --> 2:15:33.520
 And it was acquired by Google for $3.2 billion.

2:15:33.520 --> 2:15:36.640
 $3.2 billion.

2:15:36.640 --> 2:15:39.640
 As a founder and leader, just out of curiosity,

2:15:39.640 --> 2:15:44.640
 in these cases of acquisition, is it always a good thing?

2:15:44.680 --> 2:15:47.560
 Is there any part of you and the team

2:15:47.560 --> 2:15:49.920
 that considered saying no?

2:15:49.920 --> 2:15:51.960
 Oh, we considered saying no

2:15:51.960 --> 2:15:54.680
 all the way along the process, right?

2:15:54.680 --> 2:15:56.640
 We'd all been in big companies before.

2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:01.040
 We knew what it was like and the politics

2:16:01.040 --> 2:16:04.520
 and all the other stuff and what I came to learn,

2:16:04.520 --> 2:16:06.480
 especially from Phillips,

2:16:06.480 --> 2:16:08.920
 because Phillips was a very, it was 375,000 people.

2:16:08.920 --> 2:16:11.840
 It was a big, it was massive company, right?

2:16:11.840 --> 2:16:13.360
 And tons of politics.

2:16:13.360 --> 2:16:15.360
 And I was like, do we wanna go back into that world?

2:16:15.360 --> 2:16:18.000
 Because I had so many negative experiences from that.

2:16:19.520 --> 2:16:22.320
 But then going to Apple, which was not big,

2:16:22.320 --> 2:16:24.680
 but it was big enough that it could have all these dynamics.

2:16:24.680 --> 2:16:26.640
 But then when you saw a leader rise up

2:16:26.640 --> 2:16:28.760
 and get rid of those dynamics or not,

2:16:28.760 --> 2:16:31.400
 allow many of them to flourish,

2:16:32.880 --> 2:16:35.000
 then you're like, oh, with the right leadership,

2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:37.880
 this can be a beautiful marriage, right?

2:16:37.880 --> 2:16:41.000
 And so for four months, we were working together with them,

2:16:41.000 --> 2:16:43.960
 with Google, to make sure that we had the right leadership

2:16:43.960 --> 2:16:45.640
 and we were gonna be in the right environment

2:16:45.640 --> 2:16:46.760
 that it felt right.

2:16:47.800 --> 2:16:49.120
 So that happened.

2:16:49.120 --> 2:16:50.080
 It absolutely happened.

2:16:50.080 --> 2:16:51.320
 We worked on all the details.

2:16:51.320 --> 2:16:53.200
 We didn't even talk about price.

2:16:53.200 --> 2:16:55.600
 We were talking about how's the brand gonna work?

2:16:55.600 --> 2:16:56.760
 Who's the team gonna work with?

2:16:56.760 --> 2:16:58.400
 How are we gonna get IP?

2:16:58.400 --> 2:16:59.520
 How are we gonna do exchanges?

2:16:59.520 --> 2:17:01.520
 How are we gonna get budgets and all that stuff done?

2:17:01.520 --> 2:17:02.520
 So we worked through all of that

2:17:02.520 --> 2:17:04.360
 before we actually sealed any kind of deal

2:17:04.360 --> 2:17:05.840
 because they were already an investor in the company.

2:17:05.840 --> 2:17:07.400
 So we already knew,

2:17:07.400 --> 2:17:12.040
 they knew relatively where the end point was for the price.

2:17:12.040 --> 2:17:14.320
 So working through all of those prerequisites,

2:17:15.760 --> 2:17:20.160
 I knew that as a individual product company

2:17:20.160 --> 2:17:22.840
 that was trying to create a platform,

2:17:22.840 --> 2:17:25.160
 no investors were gonna invest in a platform

2:17:25.160 --> 2:17:27.480
 that could take three, four years

2:17:27.480 --> 2:17:30.360
 and many, many hundreds of millions of dollars to build

2:17:30.360 --> 2:17:33.720
 without all kinds of new products at the same time.

2:17:33.720 --> 2:17:35.960
 And products that we were having, which were successes,

2:17:35.960 --> 2:17:37.600
 but they weren't even break even yet, right?

2:17:37.600 --> 2:17:39.440
 We were still developing them.

2:17:39.440 --> 2:17:42.000
 So how are we gonna get more people to fund

2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:44.120
 all of these things and this platform

2:17:44.120 --> 2:17:46.080
 that I really wanna create?

2:17:46.080 --> 2:17:48.200
 Because my worry, and I had seen this many times

2:17:48.200 --> 2:17:51.200
 in Silicon Valley, is these small startups have bravado

2:17:51.200 --> 2:17:54.600
 and they said, I'm gonna take on the big guys, right?

2:17:54.600 --> 2:17:55.720
 With a platform.

2:17:55.720 --> 2:17:57.960
 But when those platform guys show up

2:17:57.960 --> 2:17:59.840
 and Apple says they're gonna get in the,

2:17:59.840 --> 2:18:01.680
 at the time, nobody cared.

2:18:01.680 --> 2:18:04.880
 They were curious, what's next?

2:18:04.880 --> 2:18:07.040
 But Apple wasn't in the market,

2:18:07.040 --> 2:18:09.080
 Google wasn't in the market yet,

2:18:09.080 --> 2:18:12.080
 Amazon wasn't there, Microsoft, Samsung,

2:18:12.080 --> 2:18:16.000
 they were all just, that's curious, right?

2:18:16.000 --> 2:18:19.000
 And I had watched, if you said,

2:18:19.000 --> 2:18:20.720
 I'm gonna go challenge them

2:18:20.720 --> 2:18:22.520
 and I'm gonna build a platform,

2:18:22.520 --> 2:18:24.400
 and then they all of a sudden one by one go,

2:18:24.400 --> 2:18:26.200
 oh, well, we're building a platform now,

2:18:26.200 --> 2:18:27.120
 we're building a platform.

2:18:27.120 --> 2:18:29.920
 They flooded you to death, fear, uncertainty, doubt,

2:18:29.920 --> 2:18:31.320
 and the developers run away

2:18:31.320 --> 2:18:32.360
 and you can't make that platform.

2:18:32.360 --> 2:18:35.720
 So I'm like, before the landscape gets changed on us,

2:18:35.720 --> 2:18:37.240
 because we've tracked so much attention,

2:18:37.240 --> 2:18:38.280
 they announced something,

2:18:38.280 --> 2:18:41.640
 we need to change the landscape on them.

2:18:42.920 --> 2:18:44.400
 Let's go to the best place

2:18:44.400 --> 2:18:46.400
 where we can build out the platform,

2:18:46.400 --> 2:18:48.680
 have the right leadership behind us

2:18:48.680 --> 2:18:51.760
 to help us grow this thing into what the vision it should be.

2:18:51.760 --> 2:18:53.480
 And that's what we believed we were doing

2:18:53.480 --> 2:18:55.920
 with the Google acquisition.

2:18:55.920 --> 2:19:00.040
 Is it possible to take on the platforms?

2:19:00.040 --> 2:19:01.920
 So you said there's a lot of startups

2:19:01.920 --> 2:19:04.200
 with bravado and all that kind of stuff.

2:19:04.200 --> 2:19:07.240
 It doesn't mean, James Joyce, when he was 20,

2:19:07.240 --> 2:19:09.360
 he said, I'm gonna be the greatest writer

2:19:09.360 --> 2:19:14.360
 of the 20th century before he wrote anything of value.

2:19:15.120 --> 2:19:17.040
 One of them might be actually right.

2:19:17.040 --> 2:19:21.400
 Yeah, in this modern world,

2:19:21.400 --> 2:19:24.440
 when you, so first of all, people should definitely

2:19:25.440 --> 2:19:30.440
 get your book built as just this giant number of advice

2:19:31.320 --> 2:19:36.320
 on this exact question of how to build cool things,

2:19:36.720 --> 2:19:37.800
 how to build a startup,

2:19:37.800 --> 2:19:41.720
 how to all the different stages of that team and hiring.

2:19:41.720 --> 2:19:43.080
 It's mostly human nature.

2:19:43.080 --> 2:19:44.080
 It's not technical.

2:19:44.080 --> 2:19:46.360
 It's mostly human nature behind it.

2:19:46.360 --> 2:19:48.440
 And it turns out it's,

2:19:48.440 --> 2:19:51.160
 turtles all the way down this human at the bottom.

2:19:51.160 --> 2:19:56.160
 Yes, so is it possible to build startups

2:19:56.240 --> 2:19:58.760
 that take on the big guys,

2:19:58.760 --> 2:20:01.160
 whatever that is of the modern era?

2:20:01.160 --> 2:20:05.440
 So for now, it's these platforms of Apple, Google, Twitter,

2:20:05.440 --> 2:20:08.560
 I don't even know, Meta I guess called now.

2:20:09.560 --> 2:20:11.360
 Is it possible to take them on?

2:20:11.360 --> 2:20:15.240
 Absolutely, but you don't take them on on their same turf.

2:20:15.240 --> 2:20:16.400
 You take them on on the turf

2:20:16.400 --> 2:20:20.040
 they're gonna want to have in the future, right?

2:20:20.040 --> 2:20:21.560
 Spotify is a platform.

2:20:21.560 --> 2:20:26.000
 It started as an application, is now a platform, right?

2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:27.240
 Think of WeChat.

2:20:28.600 --> 2:20:30.320
 Think of all the super apps out there

2:20:30.320 --> 2:20:33.560
 that are now wallets and delivery services

2:20:33.560 --> 2:20:37.240
 and travel services and transportation services

2:20:37.240 --> 2:20:39.320
 all within an app.

2:20:39.320 --> 2:20:40.880
 They've innovated in a different level,

2:20:40.880 --> 2:20:44.000
 in a different space that the platform companies weren't.

2:20:46.040 --> 2:20:49.440
 Google was an app company.

2:20:49.440 --> 2:20:51.120
 It was solving search.

2:20:51.120 --> 2:20:52.960
 And then it became a platform company.

2:20:52.960 --> 2:20:55.200
 Apple was solving personal computing.

2:20:55.200 --> 2:21:00.200
 And then iPhone was solving internet browsing,

2:21:00.840 --> 2:21:01.680
 all that stuff.

2:21:01.680 --> 2:21:03.120
 And then it became a platform company

2:21:03.120 --> 2:21:04.400
 when the app store was at it.

2:21:04.400 --> 2:21:05.720
 If you look at it,

2:21:05.720 --> 2:21:07.640
 there's no such thing as building a platform company.

2:21:07.640 --> 2:21:09.880
 You build a great app first,

2:21:09.880 --> 2:21:11.160
 and then you can expand it

2:21:11.160 --> 2:21:13.160
 and have the right to become a platform.

2:21:14.840 --> 2:21:19.200
 Your whole book is just a bunch of advice for young people.

2:21:19.200 --> 2:21:20.040
 But let me ask.

2:21:20.040 --> 2:21:20.920
 And older people.

2:21:20.920 --> 2:21:23.200
 And old, well, everyone is young at heart.

2:21:23.200 --> 2:21:25.280
 And if you're not, you should be.

2:21:25.280 --> 2:21:28.120
 So what, in terms of picking a career,

2:21:28.120 --> 2:21:29.720
 you have advice on this point.

2:21:29.720 --> 2:21:32.400
 What advice would you give to a person

2:21:32.400 --> 2:21:34.160
 on how to pick a career?

2:21:35.120 --> 2:21:37.320
 What is it you want to learn?

2:21:37.320 --> 2:21:39.360
 And who is it you want to learn from?

2:21:39.360 --> 2:21:41.080
 Just like you pick a university.

2:21:42.880 --> 2:21:44.840
 You're like, I wanna go here for this expertise.

2:21:44.840 --> 2:21:47.720
 I've heard about these programs, especially graduate,

2:21:47.720 --> 2:21:51.080
 graduate studies, you go for a certain program

2:21:51.080 --> 2:21:52.640
 with a certain set of people.

2:21:52.640 --> 2:21:56.440
 Why don't you do that when it comes to a job?

2:21:56.440 --> 2:21:58.400
 You just don't go, or in a career,

2:21:58.400 --> 2:21:59.280
 you just don't go and say,

2:21:59.280 --> 2:22:00.880
 I just wanna go work at Google,

2:22:00.880 --> 2:22:02.440
 or I just wanna work at Apple.

2:22:02.440 --> 2:22:04.240
 You wanna go to a certain team

2:22:04.240 --> 2:22:05.720
 with a certain set of people

2:22:05.720 --> 2:22:07.240
 and work with them on something

2:22:07.240 --> 2:22:08.920
 that you're really curious about

2:22:08.920 --> 2:22:10.440
 and you wanna learn about.

2:22:10.440 --> 2:22:12.960
 That's such, I just wanted to comment that,

2:22:12.960 --> 2:22:17.080
 that's such a, it's a subtle but a brilliant framing

2:22:17.080 --> 2:22:21.160
 of just ask the question, what do I want to learn?

2:22:22.240 --> 2:22:27.240
 And then see what career path is going to maximize that.

2:22:29.440 --> 2:22:31.000
 That's so interesting.

2:22:31.000 --> 2:22:34.040
 It's the first question I ask anyone who interviews with me.

2:22:35.000 --> 2:22:36.680
 When I say I'm gonna bring somebody on the team,

2:22:36.680 --> 2:22:39.560
 first question is, what do you wanna learn?

2:22:39.560 --> 2:22:41.840
 I don't want the expert, like we talked about earlier,

2:22:41.840 --> 2:22:43.560
 says, I'm the expert in this.

2:22:43.560 --> 2:22:46.040
 You're gonna hire me as the expert.

2:22:46.040 --> 2:22:47.600
 We're doing something new.

2:22:47.600 --> 2:22:48.440
 You're not an expert,

2:22:48.440 --> 2:22:50.120
 cause we're not an expert either.

2:22:50.120 --> 2:22:51.520
 What is it you wanna learn?

2:22:53.640 --> 2:22:58.520
 And on the topic of learning,

2:22:58.520 --> 2:23:00.600
 what is the best way to learn?

2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:06.840
 What, starting, you go into this new place,

2:23:06.840 --> 2:23:10.640
 into this new world, into maybe V1,

2:23:10.640 --> 2:23:12.200
 you said you're building V1.

2:23:12.200 --> 2:23:17.000
 I mean, the whole world is late, is full of V1s

2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:20.320
 or V0s waiting for the V1 to come along.

2:23:20.320 --> 2:23:21.160
 Zero to one.

2:23:21.160 --> 2:23:22.120
 Zero to one.

2:23:22.120 --> 2:23:25.520
 What's the process of that look like?

2:23:25.520 --> 2:23:27.080
 What's the process of learning?

2:23:27.960 --> 2:23:29.840
 How do you learn?

2:23:29.840 --> 2:23:31.680
 Well, let me put a framing

2:23:31.680 --> 2:23:34.480
 and then we'll talk about that last piece.

2:23:34.480 --> 2:23:37.960
 I have now looking back, especially writing this book,

2:23:37.960 --> 2:23:40.880
 I have a version one of myself, a version two,

2:23:40.880 --> 2:23:43.320
 a version three, a version four.

2:23:43.320 --> 2:23:46.640
 I had a lot of opinions about myself

2:23:46.640 --> 2:23:47.480
 and what I wanted to do.

2:23:47.480 --> 2:23:50.240
 Sometimes those opinions for certain people,

2:23:50.240 --> 2:23:52.080
 those opinions are formed

2:23:52.080 --> 2:23:54.080
 and they get the data from their parents

2:23:54.080 --> 2:23:55.800
 and they go do what their parents told them to do

2:23:55.800 --> 2:23:57.400
 or their surroundings.

2:23:57.400 --> 2:23:59.600
 My opinions was like, I wanna go and learn this.

2:23:59.600 --> 2:24:00.520
 I'm curious about that.

2:24:00.520 --> 2:24:02.440
 I made the zero to one move.

2:24:02.440 --> 2:24:05.280
 And then over time by doing,

2:24:05.280 --> 2:24:06.920
 I was refining those things

2:24:06.920 --> 2:24:08.520
 and learning what I was really curious about

2:24:08.520 --> 2:24:10.240
 and what I was really good about

2:24:10.240 --> 2:24:11.760
 because I was getting data.

2:24:11.760 --> 2:24:14.240
 And then I was like, then I had another set of opinions

2:24:14.240 --> 2:24:16.480
 to create version two of me.

2:24:16.480 --> 2:24:17.520
 And then I would go and do it.

2:24:17.520 --> 2:24:19.800
 So I was learning by doing,

2:24:19.800 --> 2:24:21.040
 starting with the opinion,

2:24:21.040 --> 2:24:22.560
 you're not gonna get any facts.

2:24:22.560 --> 2:24:24.160
 Most people are like,

2:24:24.160 --> 2:24:27.200
 where do I make the most money for my position?

2:24:27.200 --> 2:24:28.840
 They're trying to start with data.

2:24:30.360 --> 2:24:33.760
 Start with the why, what's your curiosity?

2:24:33.760 --> 2:24:35.440
 What do you wanna learn?

2:24:35.440 --> 2:24:37.320
 And then follow that.

2:24:37.320 --> 2:24:42.320
 I took the lowest job on the totem pole at General Magic

2:24:42.600 --> 2:24:43.520
 because I wanted to get in there

2:24:43.520 --> 2:24:44.840
 to work with the right team.

2:24:44.840 --> 2:24:47.600
 I didn't even know what they were doing, right?

2:24:47.600 --> 2:24:50.320
 But I thought that it felt right, right?

2:24:51.480 --> 2:24:54.080
 I was barely living above the poverty line working there,

2:24:54.080 --> 2:24:55.640
 working 80 hours a week

2:24:55.640 --> 2:24:57.840
 because it was so amazing to learn

2:24:57.840 --> 2:24:59.280
 just like a college student, right?

2:24:59.280 --> 2:25:00.800
 That's what I was doing.

2:25:00.800 --> 2:25:03.720
 And then I learned more from that

2:25:03.720 --> 2:25:06.120
 and then changed those opinions into data.

2:25:06.120 --> 2:25:07.800
 And then I found other opinions.

2:25:07.800 --> 2:25:11.760
 So it's the same thing, but it was by doing, right?

2:25:11.760 --> 2:25:13.720
 The way you find out what you wanna do in life

2:25:13.720 --> 2:25:16.480
 is by figuring out what you don't wanna do.

2:25:16.480 --> 2:25:17.960
 And the only way you find that out

2:25:17.960 --> 2:25:19.320
 is by doing a bunch of stuff.

2:25:19.320 --> 2:25:21.760
 Doing a bunch of stuff and refining it.

2:25:21.760 --> 2:25:22.720
 That's hilarious.

2:25:22.720 --> 2:25:23.880
 Yeah, that's brilliant.

2:25:24.800 --> 2:25:27.200
 So in terms of the career path

2:25:27.200 --> 2:25:31.520
 of leaping into the startup world and launching a startup,

2:25:31.520 --> 2:25:35.280
 what does it take to successfully found a startup,

2:25:35.280 --> 2:25:37.760
 to have a chance to succeed?

2:25:37.760 --> 2:25:42.760
 And maybe how do you decide to take that leap?

2:25:46.760 --> 2:25:49.200
 Is there sort of having founded,

2:25:49.200 --> 2:25:52.640
 having been part of many V1s,

2:25:52.640 --> 2:25:55.640
 many of some of the most successful V1s ever,

2:25:57.080 --> 2:25:58.880
 what's it take to take that leap?

2:25:58.880 --> 2:26:03.880
 Maybe leave your job, cushy job at a company

2:26:03.880 --> 2:26:06.400
 and do the startup.

2:26:06.400 --> 2:26:07.320
 What does it take?

2:26:08.680 --> 2:26:10.800
 It takes belief in yourself.

2:26:10.800 --> 2:26:12.320
 That's the first thing.

2:26:12.320 --> 2:26:13.560
 Belief that you can do it.

2:26:13.560 --> 2:26:17.520
 Not, but hopefully with mirrors or mentors around you

2:26:17.520 --> 2:26:19.480
 or coaches around you to make sure you know

2:26:19.480 --> 2:26:21.280
 you're not crazy.

2:26:21.280 --> 2:26:24.000
 It's a crazy smart idea, but you're not crazy

2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:26.040
 and you're just working on something

2:26:26.040 --> 2:26:28.960
 as like a lone mad man or woman.

2:26:31.280 --> 2:26:32.840
 You have a great idea.

2:26:32.840 --> 2:26:34.800
 And like I said, great ideas chase you.

2:26:36.680 --> 2:26:39.520
 In this world, there are so many people who have more ideas

2:26:39.520 --> 2:26:41.680
 than they have time to implement.

2:26:41.680 --> 2:26:42.920
 I used to be like that.

2:26:42.920 --> 2:26:44.800
 I would like, oh my God, if this idea, this idea,

2:26:44.800 --> 2:26:47.360
 and you try to do all of them,

2:26:47.360 --> 2:26:50.240
 but the best ideas are the ones that you can really focus on

2:26:50.240 --> 2:26:52.240
 and you shut out all those other things

2:26:52.240 --> 2:26:53.360
 and you bring them other ideas

2:26:53.360 --> 2:26:54.920
 into the thing you're trying to do.

2:26:54.920 --> 2:26:58.040
 So I try to run away from a great idea

2:26:58.040 --> 2:26:59.920
 and then it stalks me.

2:26:59.920 --> 2:27:01.840
 It hunts you down because you're like,

2:27:01.840 --> 2:27:03.520
 ah, that's gonna have this problem.

2:27:03.520 --> 2:27:05.280
 I'm gonna put it aside.

2:27:05.280 --> 2:27:08.720
 And then all of a sudden, you know, a few days later,

2:27:08.720 --> 2:27:10.480
 oh, I think I know how to solve that problem.

2:27:10.480 --> 2:27:13.520
 Or I talk to somebody and you're just always kind of

2:27:13.520 --> 2:27:15.440
 niggling around the edges of it.

2:27:15.440 --> 2:27:17.160
 And then at some point it's like,

2:27:17.160 --> 2:27:19.720
 it just becomes like this black hole

2:27:19.720 --> 2:27:20.920
 that just sucks you in and you're like,

2:27:20.920 --> 2:27:23.280
 I can't think about anything else but this.

2:27:23.280 --> 2:27:26.360
 It's almost like a relationship in the world, right?

2:27:26.360 --> 2:27:29.560
 You know, when you have it with a, you find your partner.

2:27:29.560 --> 2:27:33.080
 You know, you're like, mm, mm, wait, mm, something.

2:27:33.080 --> 2:27:34.120
 And then you're trying to like,

2:27:34.120 --> 2:27:35.720
 and then all of a sudden it just,

2:27:35.720 --> 2:27:36.760
 it comes together, right?

2:27:36.760 --> 2:27:37.760
 It's kind of like that.

2:27:37.760 --> 2:27:38.960
 Ultimately achieved focus.

2:27:38.960 --> 2:27:39.880
 See, I'm different.

2:27:39.880 --> 2:27:41.240
 I just dive right in.

2:27:41.240 --> 2:27:42.240
 I used to do that too.

2:27:42.240 --> 2:27:43.600
 I used to dive right in.

2:27:43.600 --> 2:27:44.440
 Yeah.

2:27:44.440 --> 2:27:45.680
 But I learned that you'd need time.

2:27:45.680 --> 2:27:47.280
 It's more effective to run away from it.

2:27:47.280 --> 2:27:48.240
 Run away from it.

2:27:48.240 --> 2:27:51.320
 And so it chases you because it makes you think harder

2:27:51.320 --> 2:27:52.480
 about that story.

2:27:52.480 --> 2:27:53.880
 This is not dating advice.

2:27:53.880 --> 2:27:54.880
 We're talking about stardom.

2:27:54.880 --> 2:27:57.720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:27:57.720 --> 2:28:02.720
 But ultimately, so you have achieved a focus on it.

2:28:03.080 --> 2:28:05.360
 But you also said to believe in yourself.

2:28:05.360 --> 2:28:06.880
 So it's not necessarily even the idea.

2:28:06.880 --> 2:28:11.880
 It's the human that believe in the human being.

2:28:11.880 --> 2:28:15.560
 You have to believe in yourself and the idea that you have.

2:28:15.560 --> 2:28:17.800
 Because if you don't have that belief,

2:28:17.800 --> 2:28:20.440
 then you can't project that to other people

2:28:20.440 --> 2:28:21.720
 to say, join the team.

2:28:24.120 --> 2:28:26.880
 Let me ask you on, because you mentioned mentors

2:28:26.880 --> 2:28:30.120
 and you've talked about having had incredible mentors

2:28:30.120 --> 2:28:30.960
 in your life.

2:28:30.960 --> 2:28:34.600
 You're also a mentor to a very large number of people.

2:28:34.600 --> 2:28:36.520
 What does it take to find a mentor?

2:28:36.520 --> 2:28:39.200
 How do you find a great mentor?

2:28:40.080 --> 2:28:41.720
 Usually they also find you.

2:28:42.880 --> 2:28:44.320
 Is it like with the ideas?

2:28:44.320 --> 2:28:46.800
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

2:28:46.800 --> 2:28:48.880
 No, what happens is you're in the right,

2:28:48.880 --> 2:28:51.040
 you have a community around you, okay?

2:28:51.040 --> 2:28:53.680
 And because you've been building a network,

2:28:53.680 --> 2:28:55.080
 because you can't do it alone.

2:28:55.080 --> 2:28:57.600
 So you have to create this network around you

2:28:57.600 --> 2:29:00.200
 of relationships, not transactions,

2:29:00.200 --> 2:29:02.800
 but relationships over time that you really cherish

2:29:02.800 --> 2:29:04.880
 and people you talk to, okay?

2:29:04.880 --> 2:29:09.520
 And you share vulnerable or nascent ideas with

2:29:09.520 --> 2:29:13.320
 or crazy opinions with, and then you argue them through.

2:29:13.320 --> 2:29:18.320
 But you start to see resonate, and it's not about age.

2:29:18.360 --> 2:29:20.600
 It's just about this connection, right?

2:29:20.600 --> 2:29:21.840
 I have mentors.

2:29:21.840 --> 2:29:23.920
 Obviously when I was young, all my mentors were older.

2:29:23.920 --> 2:29:27.200
 And as I get older, I have mentors who are younger than me

2:29:27.200 --> 2:29:28.560
 or the same age, right?

2:29:28.560 --> 2:29:30.240
 They're not all just older, right?

2:29:30.240 --> 2:29:32.360
 And so it's about that connection.

2:29:32.360 --> 2:29:35.000
 It's about being on that same wavelength,

2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:39.120
 but they also, they can counterbalance you.

2:29:39.120 --> 2:29:41.120
 They compliment you in some way.

2:29:41.120 --> 2:29:43.720
 Like my best mentors had nothing to do with technology.

2:29:43.720 --> 2:29:46.600
 They didn't know anything about technology, right?

2:29:46.600 --> 2:29:47.720
 The way we know it.

2:29:47.720 --> 2:29:49.840
 They were all about human nature and they could reflect that

2:29:49.840 --> 2:29:53.440
 and help me get more human focused and more empathetic

2:29:53.440 --> 2:29:56.440
 because I was so detailed in the technology.

2:29:56.440 --> 2:29:58.760
 I needed to see from other perspectives,

2:29:58.760 --> 2:30:01.120
 but then they wanted to learn more about the technology,

2:30:01.120 --> 2:30:01.960
 right?

2:30:01.960 --> 2:30:03.280
 Or they thought that this idea was so great

2:30:03.280 --> 2:30:04.760
 that it should exist.

2:30:04.760 --> 2:30:06.640
 Now let's work together on that.

2:30:06.640 --> 2:30:08.880
 So it's really, they have to find you

2:30:08.880 --> 2:30:10.040
 and you have to find them.

2:30:10.040 --> 2:30:11.640
 And that's by sharing.

2:30:11.640 --> 2:30:14.840
 You just don't go and look it up on the internet

2:30:14.840 --> 2:30:16.680
 and say, who are the best mentors in the world?

2:30:16.680 --> 2:30:18.560
 It just doesn't work that way.

2:30:18.560 --> 2:30:21.120
 So form a network of people and see where,

2:30:21.120 --> 2:30:23.960
 I mean, it's like finding relationships, finding love,

2:30:23.960 --> 2:30:24.800
 all that kind of friendship.

2:30:24.800 --> 2:30:25.640
 Human nature.

2:30:27.640 --> 2:30:29.800
 Venture capitalists, money.

2:30:29.800 --> 2:30:33.360
 Do VCs help or hurt a business in general?

2:30:33.360 --> 2:30:35.600
 So like in those early stages in the chase

2:30:35.600 --> 2:30:39.760
 of developing a V1, just what's the constructive

2:30:39.760 --> 2:30:42.840
 and destructive power of money

2:30:42.840 --> 2:30:45.280
 in the development of a brilliant idea

2:30:45.280 --> 2:30:47.600
 and the deployment of a brilliant idea?

2:30:47.600 --> 2:30:50.720
 I have seen brilliant venture capitalists.

2:30:50.720 --> 2:30:53.440
 I have seen horrible ones.

2:30:53.440 --> 2:30:56.080
 Ones that care about their LPs more

2:30:56.080 --> 2:30:58.800
 than they care about the entrepreneurs.

2:30:58.800 --> 2:31:01.200
 Of course, everyone's in it, at the end of the day,

2:31:01.200 --> 2:31:03.720
 especially venture capital, they have to give a return

2:31:03.720 --> 2:31:07.040
 to their limited partners, the people who invest in money

2:31:07.040 --> 2:31:09.560
 that they have to shepherd that money

2:31:09.560 --> 2:31:12.160
 and make sure it's watched over properly.

2:31:12.160 --> 2:31:14.760
 But when there's not a balance, a pushback

2:31:14.760 --> 2:31:17.400
 in a venture capitalist between what the LPs

2:31:17.400 --> 2:31:20.880
 needs and what the entrepreneur needs,

2:31:20.880 --> 2:31:23.480
 and that the entrepreneur might be trying really hard,

2:31:23.480 --> 2:31:25.880
 but if they don't see, the VC doesn't see,

2:31:25.880 --> 2:31:27.320
 the exit's gonna happen in two years

2:31:27.320 --> 2:31:29.840
 and they just leave them hanging,

2:31:29.840 --> 2:31:33.200
 when there's no, the value exchange is only money

2:31:33.200 --> 2:31:36.760
 and not mentorship or ideas or other things,

2:31:37.680 --> 2:31:40.320
 when there's not a relationship, but really a transaction,

2:31:40.320 --> 2:31:43.120
 that's when money is toxic.

2:31:43.120 --> 2:31:44.400
 Because you can get money everywhere.

2:31:44.400 --> 2:31:46.520
 Maybe it's a little harder today,

2:31:46.520 --> 2:31:49.840
 over the last month, but you can still find people

2:31:49.840 --> 2:31:54.480
 with money who are on that, who wanna enable your mission

2:31:54.480 --> 2:31:57.960
 and can be mentors, not always, not all of them,

2:31:57.960 --> 2:32:01.480
 but some of them can be mentors, but they're on your side,

2:32:01.480 --> 2:32:03.440
 then it's incredibly powerful

2:32:03.440 --> 2:32:06.040
 because it's not just one plus one equals two, right?

2:32:06.040 --> 2:32:07.560
 It's something bigger than that

2:32:07.560 --> 2:32:09.720
 because then they can bring their networks of people

2:32:09.720 --> 2:32:11.240
 and their networks of companies

2:32:11.240 --> 2:32:12.640
 and other people they worked with

2:32:12.640 --> 2:32:17.120
 that might wanna join your mission, right?

2:32:17.120 --> 2:32:19.280
 That's the kind of venture capitalist

2:32:19.280 --> 2:32:22.080
 and smart money that's out there, right?

2:32:22.080 --> 2:32:23.960
 But you have to build a relationship.

2:32:23.960 --> 2:32:26.040
 People go, oh, look at that valuation.

2:32:26.040 --> 2:32:29.840
 Oh, it's the brand name of the VC that's investing me.

2:32:29.840 --> 2:32:32.840
 No, it boils down to who's that partner

2:32:32.840 --> 2:32:34.640
 and how experienced are they?

2:32:34.640 --> 2:32:37.720
 Don't just give me the brand, give me the person

2:32:37.720 --> 2:32:40.040
 because that's the person I'm gonna be interacting with.

2:32:40.040 --> 2:32:42.600
 I have to, there's a million questions I wanna ask you,

2:32:42.600 --> 2:32:46.720
 but we're on season five already.

2:32:46.720 --> 2:32:49.120
 But let me ask you, it seems like

2:32:50.200 --> 2:32:51.680
 out of all the brilliant things you write about,

2:32:51.680 --> 2:32:53.040
 it seems like not an important question,

2:32:53.040 --> 2:32:55.240
 but it's a fascinating one to me as lawyers.

2:32:55.240 --> 2:32:56.240
 You write about this.

2:32:56.240 --> 2:33:01.240
 So does the company need lawyers and why?

2:33:03.600 --> 2:33:04.440
 And what kind?

2:33:04.440 --> 2:33:07.800
 So you write about sort of the value of this game, I guess.

2:33:07.800 --> 2:33:09.680
 Right, the legal game.

2:33:09.680 --> 2:33:10.520
 It's...

2:33:13.560 --> 2:33:14.600
 Why do we need lawyers?

2:33:14.600 --> 2:33:16.120
 You sound exasperated by lawyers.

2:33:16.120 --> 2:33:18.120
 I don't have a good question, I guess.

2:33:19.200 --> 2:33:20.040
 Well, because...

2:33:20.040 --> 2:33:21.320
 The why of lawyers is what you're asking.

2:33:21.320 --> 2:33:23.160
 The why of lawyers, yes, exactly.

2:33:23.160 --> 2:33:25.000
 Okay, the why of lawyers.

2:33:25.000 --> 2:33:26.360
 Thank you.

2:33:26.360 --> 2:33:27.600
 You even do the question.

2:33:29.920 --> 2:33:32.000
 We just have to put why in front of everything you ask

2:33:32.000 --> 2:33:33.200
 and then we'll be there.

2:33:33.200 --> 2:33:34.840
 Lawyers, why, why?

2:33:34.840 --> 2:33:37.040
 Even mafiosos had lawyers.

2:33:37.040 --> 2:33:42.040
 Okay, you know, Tony Soprano, you know, Scarface,

2:33:44.800 --> 2:33:46.920
 all of them had lawyers, right?

2:33:46.920 --> 2:33:47.880
 Why?

2:33:47.880 --> 2:33:49.640
 Because there are things in this world

2:33:49.640 --> 2:33:53.240
 that you don't always consider in the government,

2:33:53.240 --> 2:33:57.960
 in laws, in competitors,

2:33:57.960 --> 2:34:00.280
 because you're so focused on what you're doing,

2:34:00.280 --> 2:34:02.760
 they have to watch out for you, right?

2:34:03.600 --> 2:34:05.640
 Now, the best kind of lawyers are the ones

2:34:05.640 --> 2:34:08.920
 who try to work with you to enable what you're doing

2:34:08.920 --> 2:34:11.600
 and see gray areas.

2:34:11.600 --> 2:34:15.280
 Law is not black or white, it's how it's interpreted, right?

2:34:15.280 --> 2:34:17.600
 And so they can help interpret things a certain way

2:34:17.600 --> 2:34:19.960
 or help push on things a certain way

2:34:19.960 --> 2:34:22.400
 to get change to happen or allow change to happen.

2:34:22.400 --> 2:34:24.040
 Because if you have lawyers who are always,

2:34:24.040 --> 2:34:26.440
 just like you were talking about PR people,

2:34:26.440 --> 2:34:28.280
 if you have lawyers who are always saying no to everything,

2:34:28.280 --> 2:34:30.720
 because their job is to really say no or maybe,

2:34:30.720 --> 2:34:32.600
 they'll never say yes.

2:34:32.600 --> 2:34:35.040
 And you also say their job is to say no

2:34:35.040 --> 2:34:36.280
 and bill you by the hour.

2:34:36.280 --> 2:34:38.320
 Exactly, exactly.

2:34:38.320 --> 2:34:39.160
 Depressing.

2:34:39.160 --> 2:34:40.240
 Right?

2:34:40.240 --> 2:34:41.080
 Yeah.

2:34:41.080 --> 2:34:42.320
 If you don't wanna know, don't ask them,

2:34:42.320 --> 2:34:43.360
 because you're gonna get a no,

2:34:43.360 --> 2:34:44.200
 maybe a maybe.

2:34:44.200 --> 2:34:45.040
 And you'll get charged for it.

2:34:45.040 --> 2:34:47.640
 And you'll get charged for it anyways, right?

2:34:47.640 --> 2:34:52.360
 So to have a partner, to have them on your team,

2:34:52.360 --> 2:34:55.000
 to help you see maybe some of the things you don't see,

2:34:55.000 --> 2:34:58.200
 some consequences, they help to rein that in

2:34:58.200 --> 2:35:00.120
 or change your language.

2:35:00.120 --> 2:35:02.240
 Like, are you gonna get sued for this ad?

2:35:02.240 --> 2:35:05.000
 Just change this one word and it helps.

2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:06.040
 Right?

2:35:06.040 --> 2:35:07.720
 So you need to have a partner.

2:35:07.720 --> 2:35:10.840
 Most of the times, especially engineers or designers,

2:35:10.840 --> 2:35:12.680
 they see lawyers as only stifling.

2:35:13.800 --> 2:35:15.400
 Lawyers can actually, if you do it right

2:35:15.400 --> 2:35:16.640
 and you have the right type,

2:35:16.640 --> 2:35:19.000
 they can actually open up a whole new world for you

2:35:19.000 --> 2:35:20.520
 because of the interpretation

2:35:20.520 --> 2:35:22.840
 and how we go about doing things.

2:35:22.840 --> 2:35:23.680
 So.

2:35:23.680 --> 2:35:25.520
 And they help you not get bogged down

2:35:25.520 --> 2:35:28.480
 in the pain of little mistakes that didn't mean anything.

2:35:28.480 --> 2:35:29.800
 Exactly, you shot yourself in the foot

2:35:29.800 --> 2:35:30.640
 and you didn't even know it.

2:35:30.640 --> 2:35:33.600
 You didn't even know you were carrying the gun.

2:35:33.600 --> 2:35:36.720
 Just to jump around, Charles Bukowski once wrote,

2:35:36.720 --> 2:35:39.760
 "'Find what you love and let it kill you.'"

2:35:40.680 --> 2:35:44.120
 So the question is about work life balance.

2:35:44.120 --> 2:35:46.560
 That's like finding an idea and let it chase you.

2:35:46.560 --> 2:35:48.600
 Yes, but a little more aggressive.

2:35:50.480 --> 2:35:54.320
 So what does work life balance look like

2:35:54.320 --> 2:35:59.320
 that maximizes success and or happiness?

2:35:59.600 --> 2:36:02.400
 Is there such a thing as work life balance?

2:36:02.400 --> 2:36:05.640
 Is, can you speak to this?

2:36:05.640 --> 2:36:07.320
 When your work is your life,

2:36:07.320 --> 2:36:10.160
 and I mean that in the positive sense.

2:36:10.160 --> 2:36:12.960
 When you're on a mission that really matters

2:36:12.960 --> 2:36:15.880
 and you know that you can really affect,

2:36:15.880 --> 2:36:18.040
 not just yourself, but other people's lives,

2:36:18.040 --> 2:36:21.360
 and then that is very rewarding, right?

2:36:21.360 --> 2:36:23.240
 That's not work.

2:36:23.240 --> 2:36:25.240
 That's, like I said, a mission, right?

2:36:25.240 --> 2:36:27.320
 You adopt that.

2:36:27.320 --> 2:36:30.200
 But that said, you still need to have boundaries yourself.

2:36:30.200 --> 2:36:32.240
 At General Magic, wonderful documentary,

2:36:32.240 --> 2:36:34.040
 if no one's seen it, you gotta see that.

2:36:34.040 --> 2:36:35.160
 It's amazing.

2:36:35.160 --> 2:36:37.320
 I was physically and mentally unhealthy,

2:36:37.320 --> 2:36:38.760
 socially unhealthy as well,

2:36:38.760 --> 2:36:42.120
 because I put every waking minute into this thing,

2:36:43.160 --> 2:36:44.680
 every ounce of me into it.

2:36:45.680 --> 2:36:48.920
 And when it was a spectacular disaster,

2:36:48.920 --> 2:36:51.160
 we were making the iPhone 15 years too early,

2:36:53.000 --> 2:36:54.040
 the bottom fell out.

2:36:54.040 --> 2:36:55.720
 I had nothing left.

2:36:55.720 --> 2:36:59.840
 I had to get healthy socially, emotionally, physically

2:36:59.840 --> 2:37:03.240
 after that, that trauma.

2:37:03.240 --> 2:37:04.520
 I let everything go.

2:37:04.520 --> 2:37:06.920
 I learned from that that you have to,

2:37:06.920 --> 2:37:09.560
 even though you might put everything into your work,

2:37:09.560 --> 2:37:11.880
 you need to find balance outside of it.

2:37:11.880 --> 2:37:14.320
 Now that doesn't mean you're always,

2:37:14.320 --> 2:37:16.960
 you know, it's three days a week working

2:37:16.960 --> 2:37:19.160
 and four days a week or whatever it was.

2:37:19.160 --> 2:37:21.240
 You're still working as hard as ever,

2:37:21.240 --> 2:37:23.320
 but what you're doing is you're making sure

2:37:23.320 --> 2:37:26.080
 when your thinking time is during work,

2:37:26.080 --> 2:37:28.160
 that you're not ruminating at three in the morning.

2:37:28.160 --> 2:37:31.360
 You use the tools that you have to put those ideas

2:37:31.360 --> 2:37:34.280
 into databases or on pages or somewhere else

2:37:34.280 --> 2:37:36.560
 so you can go back and look at them.

2:37:36.560 --> 2:37:37.960
 So you're not always having to remember,

2:37:37.960 --> 2:37:39.000
 because what happens is most people

2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:40.400
 don't write this stuff down.

2:37:40.400 --> 2:37:41.880
 So they just sit here and got to remember this,

2:37:41.880 --> 2:37:43.920
 I got to remember this, I got to remember this.

2:37:43.920 --> 2:37:45.520
 If you just put it into the tools

2:37:45.520 --> 2:37:48.080
 and you can come back to it, you can come back fresh.

2:37:48.080 --> 2:37:49.720
 A lot of the time is about ruminating

2:37:49.720 --> 2:37:52.760
 about what I need to get done and remembering everything

2:37:52.760 --> 2:37:54.360
 instead of doing the work.

2:37:55.520 --> 2:37:56.440
 That's fascinating.

2:37:56.440 --> 2:37:58.480
 So if you just put it down on paper,

2:37:58.480 --> 2:38:00.320
 you can actually escape it.

2:38:00.320 --> 2:38:03.160
 Escape it for a time, to have peace for a time.

2:38:03.160 --> 2:38:08.160
 You mentioned General Magic.

2:38:08.160 --> 2:38:10.600
 Let me ask you the Russian question.

2:38:11.600 --> 2:38:13.200
 The Russian question.

2:38:13.200 --> 2:38:18.200
 What's been the darkest moments of your life?

2:38:20.160 --> 2:38:21.600
 Where are some of the darkest places

2:38:21.600 --> 2:38:22.840
 you've got in your mind?

2:38:22.840 --> 2:38:26.000
 You talked about if you're doing these kinds of things

2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:28.920
 with startups, you're gonna have to face a crisis.

2:38:28.920 --> 2:38:29.760
 Right, absolutely.

2:38:29.760 --> 2:38:31.360
 If you're doing it right, you're gonna face it.

2:38:31.360 --> 2:38:34.000
 So for you personally, where were some

2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:37.400
 of the tougher moments in your life?

2:38:37.400 --> 2:38:42.160
 Growing up, I went to 12 schools in 15 years.

2:38:43.160 --> 2:38:45.360
 I was always the new kid.

2:38:47.320 --> 2:38:49.240
 Put yourself in those shoes, right?

2:38:49.240 --> 2:38:51.400
 You picked on, what were you picked on?

2:38:51.400 --> 2:38:53.600
 Well, absolutely, but even more so,

2:38:53.600 --> 2:38:55.680
 I was the geek with the computer.

2:38:55.680 --> 2:38:57.320
 Remember the nerds in the 80s?

2:38:57.320 --> 2:38:59.520
 You probably don't know this, but believe me,

2:38:59.520 --> 2:39:01.160
 we were made fun of.

2:39:01.160 --> 2:39:02.800
 What were these computers?

2:39:02.800 --> 2:39:03.640
 What were these things?

2:39:03.640 --> 2:39:04.920
 You're off in a cold.

2:39:04.920 --> 2:39:07.400
 They're all off partying or going, whatever it was,

2:39:07.400 --> 2:39:09.280
 and I'm sitting there like,

2:39:09.280 --> 2:39:12.480
 and they're like, this guy is just this alien, right?

2:39:12.480 --> 2:39:15.040
 Who's this new guy who just showed up and,

2:39:15.040 --> 2:39:17.960
 and then you would ask the smart questions

2:39:17.960 --> 2:39:20.280
 and you couldn't be the smartest in the,

2:39:20.280 --> 2:39:22.560
 because then you get picked on too.

2:39:22.560 --> 2:39:23.680
 And you're the new kid.

2:39:23.680 --> 2:39:26.280
 So you're in this environment that's ever changing.

2:39:26.280 --> 2:39:29.800
 You don't fit in and you are just asking questions

2:39:29.800 --> 2:39:32.480
 because you think they're the right questions to answer,

2:39:32.480 --> 2:39:34.440
 but then they like, you're making us look bad.

2:39:34.440 --> 2:39:35.520
 Don't ask these smart questions

2:39:35.520 --> 2:39:37.200
 because you're gonna make us do more work.

2:39:37.200 --> 2:39:40.560
 So right there, it's pretty tough.

2:39:40.560 --> 2:39:41.800
 And I'm moving cities, right?

2:39:41.800 --> 2:39:42.800
 And I didn't have the internet

2:39:42.800 --> 2:39:44.080
 to stay connected to people.

2:39:44.080 --> 2:39:45.920
 There was no internet.

2:39:45.920 --> 2:39:47.640
 Phone calls were $2 a minute.

2:39:47.640 --> 2:39:49.280
 So it was lonely too.

2:39:49.280 --> 2:39:51.680
 It was lonely, right?

2:39:51.680 --> 2:39:52.520
 Right?

2:39:52.520 --> 2:39:54.840
 I was a latchkey kid, right?

2:39:54.840 --> 2:39:56.880
 I had my brother, but he was a skateboarder

2:39:56.880 --> 2:40:00.640
 and he had a different social way of working.

2:40:00.640 --> 2:40:02.400
 He loved to do that stuff and be outside.

2:40:02.400 --> 2:40:03.480
 I loved the computer.

2:40:03.480 --> 2:40:06.600
 So even in the computer, you were alone in the family.

2:40:06.600 --> 2:40:09.000
 With the computer in the family, you were alone.

2:40:09.000 --> 2:40:09.840
 I was absolutely alone.

2:40:09.840 --> 2:40:10.680
 That was just me.

2:40:10.680 --> 2:40:15.240
 But then, then you could find the other geeks, right?

2:40:15.240 --> 2:40:16.480
 But there were just a few of us

2:40:16.480 --> 2:40:18.480
 and we made this little thing.

2:40:18.480 --> 2:40:20.040
 But then when you moved away,

2:40:20.040 --> 2:40:22.400
 you know, then I had to use a BBS

2:40:22.400 --> 2:40:24.960
 and a bulletin board system and a dial up modem.

2:40:24.960 --> 2:40:27.960
 And then I started hacking the phone system

2:40:27.960 --> 2:40:32.000
 to get free codes on MCI and Sprint back in the day

2:40:32.000 --> 2:40:35.160
 to get long distance, to get free codes to call my friends,

2:40:35.160 --> 2:40:37.120
 the geeks on the other side, right?

2:40:37.120 --> 2:40:39.320
 Or to dial into a BBS cheaply

2:40:39.320 --> 2:40:41.200
 that was in another part of the world.

2:40:41.200 --> 2:40:43.600
 So this was this subculture

2:40:43.600 --> 2:40:45.400
 and that was not accepted in any way.

2:40:45.400 --> 2:40:47.120
 And not the heroes that you see today

2:40:47.120 --> 2:40:52.000
 that are on the richest people in the world and everything.

2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:54.280
 So that was the first set of trauma.

2:40:54.280 --> 2:40:56.640
 And then the next one really was general magic.

2:40:56.640 --> 2:40:59.080
 You know, the end of that, like I described before.

2:40:59.080 --> 2:41:01.840
 And pulling yourself out and going just,

2:41:01.840 --> 2:41:03.960
 cause I got so insular in that world

2:41:03.960 --> 2:41:07.080
 of geeking out and building stuff

2:41:07.080 --> 2:41:09.720
 that I just tore all the social ties, right?

2:41:11.000 --> 2:41:12.960
 Because it was just, it was a drug.

2:41:12.960 --> 2:41:13.920
 I was hooked on that.

2:41:13.920 --> 2:41:15.440
 I was a junkie.

2:41:15.440 --> 2:41:17.920
 I had to get clean.

2:41:17.920 --> 2:41:22.920
 Yeah, and that made you who you are.

2:41:23.760 --> 2:41:24.760
 Tempered, tempered.

2:41:28.040 --> 2:41:31.280
 So Steve Jobs is no longer with us.

2:41:32.360 --> 2:41:36.280
 One day you also will no longer be with us.

2:41:36.280 --> 2:41:39.720
 That's the thing about this life, it ends.

2:41:41.880 --> 2:41:43.840
 So no matter how many incredible things

2:41:43.840 --> 2:41:44.920
 you brought to this world,

2:41:44.920 --> 2:41:48.120
 no matter how many inventions you built,

2:41:48.120 --> 2:41:49.520
 you too shall perish.

2:41:49.520 --> 2:41:51.520
 Do you think about this?

2:41:51.520 --> 2:41:53.600
 Are you afraid of your death?

2:41:57.680 --> 2:41:59.120
 I am not afraid of my death.

2:42:00.800 --> 2:42:02.400
 I am an atheist.

2:42:04.040 --> 2:42:06.760
 And I think about the soul.

2:42:06.760 --> 2:42:08.400
 Because I do, even though I'm an atheist,

2:42:08.400 --> 2:42:09.320
 I think about the soul.

2:42:09.320 --> 2:42:14.120
 And the soul is the thing that you instill in others

2:42:14.120 --> 2:42:16.000
 when you go that lives on.

2:42:16.880 --> 2:42:20.520
 It's not this thing that's magically in space.

2:42:20.520 --> 2:42:23.360
 It's the thing that you've imparted onto people

2:42:23.360 --> 2:42:26.520
 that you worked with and those relationships you've had.

2:42:26.520 --> 2:42:31.320
 And that soul lives on in the stories that they tell, right?

2:42:31.320 --> 2:42:34.040
 And through Build, I'm hopeful that those stories

2:42:34.040 --> 2:42:36.600
 stay relevant because they're human nature.

2:42:36.600 --> 2:42:39.280
 They're not about who knows what the next iPhone thing is

2:42:39.280 --> 2:42:40.680
 or the next iPod thing is.

2:42:40.680 --> 2:42:45.120
 The stuff that I have been able, the privilege to make

2:42:45.120 --> 2:42:48.480
 and work with people, those are all ephemeral.

2:42:48.480 --> 2:42:49.760
 The iPod's gone now, right?

2:42:49.760 --> 2:42:54.280
 This week, it was announced iPod's dead after 21 years.

2:42:56.080 --> 2:42:59.120
 It is those human connections.

2:42:59.120 --> 2:43:00.840
 It's that growth that you've helped someone

2:43:00.840 --> 2:43:02.440
 just like they helped me.

2:43:02.440 --> 2:43:04.920
 Just like Bill Campbell or Steve Jobs is gone,

2:43:04.920 --> 2:43:06.920
 but they made me be better.

2:43:06.920 --> 2:43:09.080
 That's the soul that I believe in.

2:43:09.080 --> 2:43:11.320
 That's fascinating that you say that.

2:43:11.320 --> 2:43:14.240
 Yeah, so many of these products,

2:43:14.240 --> 2:43:16.080
 I mean, to push back a little bit,

2:43:16.080 --> 2:43:18.480
 so even though the iPod is an end of an era.

2:43:19.880 --> 2:43:20.960
 Using it every day.

2:43:22.040 --> 2:43:25.720
 I think that, I mean, the number of people that impacted

2:43:26.640 --> 2:43:31.640
 is just, so I suppose the soul is carried by the people.

2:43:32.160 --> 2:43:33.000
 Exactly.

2:43:33.000 --> 2:43:34.720
 Sometimes the products you create

2:43:34.720 --> 2:43:36.520
 is the sort of the transport mechanism.

2:43:36.520 --> 2:43:38.120
 It's the vessel.

2:43:38.120 --> 2:43:38.960
 It's the vessel.

2:43:38.960 --> 2:43:41.400
 They felt the love, and they felt that love,

2:43:41.400 --> 2:43:42.400
 and it transformed them,

2:43:42.400 --> 2:43:44.480
 even if they don't have the vessel anymore.

2:43:44.480 --> 2:43:46.720
 Yeah, and in that way, the soul lives on.

2:43:46.720 --> 2:43:48.800
 Just like the body is the vessel.

2:43:48.800 --> 2:43:50.240
 That's beautifully put.

2:43:50.240 --> 2:43:52.160
 Why do you think we're here?

2:43:52.160 --> 2:43:54.360
 What's the meaning of life, Tony?

2:43:54.360 --> 2:43:56.560
 Jesus Christ.

2:43:56.560 --> 2:43:58.000
 And death, man.

2:43:58.000 --> 2:43:58.960
 We're going all around.

2:43:58.960 --> 2:44:00.000
 Meaning of life?

2:44:00.000 --> 2:44:01.040
 Why, why?

2:44:01.040 --> 2:44:03.680
 Because you said it's important to have a press release.

2:44:03.680 --> 2:44:04.520
 I did.

2:44:07.280 --> 2:44:08.120
 Okay.

2:44:08.120 --> 2:44:09.240
 If humanity, if life on earth,

2:44:09.240 --> 2:44:11.800
 if this thing, the consciousness,

2:44:11.800 --> 2:44:15.600
 the falling in love, and building bridges,

2:44:15.600 --> 2:44:18.480
 and iPods, and rockets,

2:44:18.480 --> 2:44:22.040
 and trying to extend out into the cosmos, why?

2:44:22.040 --> 2:44:23.640
 Why do you think we're doing it?

2:44:25.800 --> 2:44:27.680
 Is there any meaning to it?

2:44:27.680 --> 2:44:30.000
 We are naturally curious.

2:44:30.000 --> 2:44:35.000
 We're, we are naturally curious individuals.

2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:39.040
 And we are always looking for meaning.

2:44:39.920 --> 2:44:42.760
 We're always trying to ascribe meaning to something,

2:44:42.760 --> 2:44:46.320
 or understanding of something, right?

2:44:46.320 --> 2:44:49.680
 And through that, it's just like evolution, right?

2:44:49.680 --> 2:44:50.600
 And Darwinism.

2:44:50.600 --> 2:44:53.600
 It's just that thing that's baked into our being

2:44:53.600 --> 2:44:55.280
 at the most fundamental level.

2:44:55.280 --> 2:44:56.720
 Driven by curiosity.

2:44:56.720 --> 2:44:58.720
 Driven by curiosity.

2:44:58.720 --> 2:45:01.360
 You're creating some pretty cool things along the way.

2:45:01.360 --> 2:45:03.480
 Tony, you, and speaking of cool things,

2:45:03.480 --> 2:45:06.880
 you've created some of the coolest things ever.

2:45:06.880 --> 2:45:09.440
 And on top of that, you're just an amazing human being.

2:45:09.440 --> 2:45:11.640
 It's a huge honor that you'll sit and talk to me today.

2:45:11.640 --> 2:45:12.800
 This is fun.

2:45:12.800 --> 2:45:14.320
 Lex, this is great.

2:45:14.320 --> 2:45:16.160
 I didn't know where I was going,

2:45:16.160 --> 2:45:18.880
 and I'm, let's talk, I'm looking for season.

2:45:18.880 --> 2:45:19.720
 I would love to.

2:45:19.720 --> 2:45:20.560
 Seven, eight, nine.

2:45:20.560 --> 2:45:21.400
 Six, seven, yes.

2:45:21.400 --> 2:45:22.840
 Let's go hang out and have dinner,

2:45:22.840 --> 2:45:24.920
 and just rap about all kinds of crazy,

2:45:24.920 --> 2:45:26.480
 I'd love to continue this.

2:45:26.480 --> 2:45:27.320
 I would too.

2:45:27.320 --> 2:45:28.160
 Thank you so much, Tony.

2:45:28.160 --> 2:45:29.560
 Thanks, man.

2:45:29.560 --> 2:45:32.360
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Tony Fadal.

2:45:32.360 --> 2:45:33.880
 To support this podcast,

2:45:33.880 --> 2:45:36.960
 please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:45:36.960 --> 2:45:39.000
 And now, let me leave you with some words

2:45:39.000 --> 2:45:41.200
 from Tony Fadal himself.

2:45:41.200 --> 2:45:43.720
 The most wonderful part of building something together

2:45:43.720 --> 2:45:46.720
 with a team is that you're walking side by side

2:45:46.720 --> 2:45:48.320
 with other people.

2:45:48.320 --> 2:45:49.880
 You're all looking at your feet

2:45:49.880 --> 2:45:52.520
 and scanning the horizon at the same time.

2:45:52.520 --> 2:45:54.640
 Some people will see things you can't,

2:45:54.640 --> 2:45:58.480
 and you will see things that are invisible to everyone else.

2:45:58.480 --> 2:46:00.920
 So don't think doing the work just means

2:46:00.920 --> 2:46:02.800
 locking yourself into a room.

2:46:02.800 --> 2:46:05.320
 A huge part of it is walking with your team.

2:46:06.200 --> 2:46:09.240
 The work is reaching your destination together

2:46:09.240 --> 2:46:11.320
 or finding a new destination

2:46:11.320 --> 2:46:13.240
 and bringing the team with you.

2:46:13.240 --> 2:46:33.240
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
