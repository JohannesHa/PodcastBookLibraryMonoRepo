WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.420
 We have two tubes that are right next to each other

00:02.420 --> 00:03.260
 in the throat.

00:03.260 --> 00:06.580
 One is for food, drink, saliva, mucus, snot,

00:06.580 --> 00:08.280
 whatever you're gonna swallow.

00:08.280 --> 00:10.460
 All of that stuff must go down the esophagus,

00:10.460 --> 00:12.620
 the food tube, and end up in the stomach.

00:12.620 --> 00:15.620
 And right next to the esophagus, millimeters away,

00:15.620 --> 00:17.500
 is the windpipe or the trachea,

00:17.500 --> 00:18.980
 which goes down to the lungs.

00:18.980 --> 00:21.620
 Throat, heart, feces, genitals.

00:21.620 --> 00:24.860
 Every organ from moment to moment keeps us alive

00:24.860 --> 00:25.980
 and ensures our survival.

00:25.980 --> 00:27.900
 The genitals are, in a way, the opposite.

00:27.900 --> 00:31.460
 How would you improve the penis and the vagina?

00:33.940 --> 00:36.620
 The following is a conversation with Jonathan Reisman,

00:36.620 --> 00:40.020
 a physician and writer of The Unseen Body,

00:40.020 --> 00:42.580
 a doctor's journey through the hidden wonders

00:42.580 --> 00:44.140
 of human anatomy.

00:44.140 --> 00:46.620
 He has practiced medicine in some of the world's

00:46.620 --> 00:49.740
 most remote places, including the Alaskan

00:49.740 --> 00:52.840
 and Russian Arctic, Antarctica,

00:52.840 --> 00:56.560
 and the Himalayan mountains of Nepal.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.740
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:58.740 --> 01:00.960
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:00.960 --> 01:02.340
 in the description.

01:02.340 --> 01:05.860
 And now, dear friends, here's Jonathan Reisman.

01:06.740 --> 01:09.500
 You wrote a book called Unseen Body,

01:09.500 --> 01:12.180
 all about the human body, the messy, the weird,

01:12.180 --> 01:14.840
 the beautiful, and the fascinating details.

01:15.980 --> 01:18.280
 So, from an evolutionary perspective,

01:18.280 --> 01:21.900
 are most parts of the human body a feature or a bug?

01:21.900 --> 01:24.220
 Is it like the optimal solution

01:24.220 --> 01:26.280
 or just a duct tape solution?

01:26.280 --> 01:27.160
 Great question.

01:27.160 --> 01:29.460
 I think that most of the time,

01:29.460 --> 01:32.420
 the way the body works is the best solution.

01:32.420 --> 01:35.660
 I haven't seen many alternatives, so it's hard to compare.

01:35.660 --> 01:38.240
 But I think, you know, there's some parts of the body

01:38.240 --> 01:40.160
 that make more sense than others.

01:40.160 --> 01:43.560
 You know, the way our hands work, for instance.

01:43.560 --> 01:45.320
 You know, the muscles are up in the forearm

01:45.320 --> 01:47.060
 and then the tendons kind of come down

01:47.060 --> 01:48.900
 like strings on a puppet.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.740
 And just the dexterity it gives our hands

01:50.740 --> 01:52.640
 is just really amazing.

01:52.640 --> 01:55.340
 And it's hard to imagine a better tool

01:55.340 --> 01:57.380
 than the human hand to do everything from, you know,

01:57.380 --> 01:59.780
 hold things to play piano

01:59.780 --> 02:02.580
 and do a million other daily activities that we do.

02:03.960 --> 02:05.100
 One thing I talk about in the book,

02:05.100 --> 02:07.820
 there's some other body parts that seem to be lacking

02:07.820 --> 02:11.540
 that kind of brilliant design, such as the throat,

02:11.540 --> 02:15.260
 you know, where the food, drink are swallowed

02:15.260 --> 02:17.000
 and air is inhaled, and they kind of,

02:17.000 --> 02:19.860
 those two paths come within millimeters of each other.

02:19.860 --> 02:22.580
 And you slip up once, you laugh while eating,

02:22.580 --> 02:25.540
 or you speak while trying to swallow and you die

02:25.540 --> 02:26.380
 from choking.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.300
 So it seems less than optimal,

02:28.300 --> 02:30.060
 though I'm not sure it could be better

02:30.060 --> 02:33.020
 from the way we're kind of formed in the womb

02:33.020 --> 02:35.860
 as a beginning as this tiny little tube.

02:35.860 --> 02:37.700
 I don't think it could have been done any better

02:37.700 --> 02:39.100
 or there's any other way to do it,

02:39.100 --> 02:41.500
 but it is an unfortunate thing that, you know,

02:41.500 --> 02:42.980
 does lead to some problems.

02:42.980 --> 02:46.420
 So the hand, if I could just link on that for a second,

02:46.420 --> 02:50.420
 you talk about the wisdom of a design in the book.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.340
 What are the important things about the hand?

02:52.340 --> 02:55.220
 It seems like very useful for many things

02:55.220 --> 02:57.420
 and it seems to be quite effective.

02:57.420 --> 03:01.060
 A lot of people think the thumb is foundational

03:01.060 --> 03:05.580
 to the human civilization.

03:05.580 --> 03:07.220
 Is there any truth to that?

03:07.220 --> 03:08.060
 I think that is true.

03:08.060 --> 03:10.260
 Actually, one of the ways in which the importance

03:10.260 --> 03:13.300
 of individual fingers comes to attention

03:13.300 --> 03:15.780
 is when people have severe injuries to their fingers.

03:15.780 --> 03:18.420
 For instance, I have a story in the book

03:18.420 --> 03:21.220
 about a guy whose thumb is nearly ripped off

03:21.220 --> 03:23.100
 by his dog's leash.

03:23.100 --> 03:26.180
 And, you know, when plastic surgeons

03:26.180 --> 03:27.740
 who are often the ones to repair that,

03:27.740 --> 03:29.660
 sometimes it's orthopedic surgeons,

03:29.660 --> 03:31.340
 they will debate, you know,

03:31.340 --> 03:33.900
 how important is it to save this finger

03:33.900 --> 03:36.020
 or how important is it to save, you know,

03:36.020 --> 03:38.700
 let's say the kind of tip,

03:38.700 --> 03:41.340
 the one third, the tip one third of one of your fingers.

03:41.340 --> 03:43.140
 You know, it depends on the length that you'll lose.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.740
 It depends on which finger.

03:44.740 --> 03:47.980
 And so the thumb really is the most crucial,

03:47.980 --> 03:50.620
 just, you know, for your occupation in most cases

03:50.620 --> 03:54.060
 to just daily life and your ability to get around

03:54.060 --> 03:55.220
 and take care of yourself and others.

03:55.220 --> 03:57.540
 So, you know, there'll be more,

03:57.540 --> 03:59.980
 they're willing to go further, do more surgeries,

03:59.980 --> 04:03.340
 more aggressive therapy to save a thumb, let's say,

04:03.340 --> 04:05.420
 than, you know, the tip of your pinky finger.

04:05.420 --> 04:07.620
 So in that way, I do think the thumb, you know,

04:07.620 --> 04:09.820
 does seem like the most important in many ways.

04:09.820 --> 04:11.300
 It's nice that there's backups.

04:11.300 --> 04:13.100
 I wonder if that's part of the future

04:13.100 --> 04:15.940
 or is it just the symmetry that nature produces?

04:15.940 --> 04:18.740
 You think the two hands is like,

04:18.740 --> 04:21.460
 is it about the symmetry or is it about backup?

04:21.460 --> 04:25.620
 We'd be much less formidable hunters, gatherers,

04:25.620 --> 04:29.340
 survivors in any way if we only had one hand.

04:29.340 --> 04:32.220
 So I think that is important to have two

04:32.220 --> 04:34.820
 so we can, you know, even everything from kind of

04:34.820 --> 04:36.940
 spearing an animal to firing a bow and arrow

04:36.940 --> 04:37.820
 to butchering an animal.

04:37.820 --> 04:40.340
 You really need two hands to do it very effectively.

04:40.340 --> 04:43.140
 But can you do a better job with three?

04:43.140 --> 04:44.780
 Great question.

04:44.780 --> 04:48.700
 And we'll never know, perhaps.

04:48.700 --> 04:51.500
 You tweeted, now I'm gonna analyze your tweets

04:51.500 --> 04:53.140
 like it's Shakespeare sometimes.

04:54.140 --> 04:56.180
 You tweeted that, quote, millions of years

04:56.180 --> 04:59.220
 of sex and death design the human body.

05:00.140 --> 05:01.620
 It's like poetry.

05:01.620 --> 05:05.860
 Are those two basic activities basically summarize

05:05.860 --> 05:09.100
 everything that resulted in humans on Earth?

05:09.100 --> 05:13.820
 So like, is that a good summary of the evolutionary process

05:13.820 --> 05:16.500
 that led to this conscious intelligent being,

05:16.500 --> 05:19.220
 is death and sex?

05:19.220 --> 05:20.300
 In a way, yeah.

05:20.300 --> 05:23.500
 So sex is how more of us get made, obviously.

05:23.500 --> 05:25.700
 And death is how we get weeded out

05:25.700 --> 05:27.940
 or the gene pool gets weeded out

05:27.940 --> 05:30.140
 and certain genes survive and others don't.

05:30.140 --> 05:33.500
 And, you know, the age at which we die,

05:33.500 --> 05:35.620
 whether it's before we've, you know,

05:35.620 --> 05:38.620
 had sex and reproduced ourselves is a big factor

05:38.620 --> 05:41.180
 and who survives, who doesn't, who passes on their genes

05:41.180 --> 05:43.900
 and what the future of the body looks like.

05:43.900 --> 05:46.340
 You know, who lived and who died

05:46.340 --> 05:48.980
 before they were able to be at reproductive age

05:48.980 --> 05:50.860
 a million years ago was pretty important

05:50.860 --> 05:52.660
 in what we look like now.

05:52.660 --> 05:55.820
 And perhaps how we have sex and die now

05:55.820 --> 05:58.180
 will determine what we're shaped like

05:58.180 --> 06:00.300
 unless technology has an even bigger role in that,

06:00.300 --> 06:01.580
 you know, a million years from now.

06:01.580 --> 06:02.860
 So you think that's fundamental

06:02.860 --> 06:05.260
 to like if there's alien civilizations out there

06:05.260 --> 06:07.740
 that have the same order of magnitude

06:07.740 --> 06:09.460
 of intelligence or greater,

06:09.460 --> 06:12.020
 do you think that we will see something like sex

06:12.020 --> 06:13.820
 and something like death?

06:13.820 --> 06:18.740
 So the reproducing and this selection process

06:18.740 --> 06:23.260
 plus the weeding out of the old to make room for the new,

06:23.260 --> 06:25.540
 is that kind of foundational to life?

06:25.540 --> 06:26.380
 I would think so.

06:26.380 --> 06:27.900
 I mean, it sure seems to be on earth,

06:27.900 --> 06:29.860
 you know, perhaps in some distant future

06:29.860 --> 06:33.300
 when medicine is nearing, you know, perfection

06:33.300 --> 06:35.520
 and people can live a really long time.

06:35.520 --> 06:39.060
 Maybe we won't even need to reproduce as much

06:39.060 --> 06:41.060
 or something like that, you know,

06:41.060 --> 06:43.780
 it's hard to even know what life will be like

06:43.780 --> 06:44.620
 in the distant future.

06:44.620 --> 06:46.900
 But I would guess that any alien civilization

06:46.900 --> 06:50.100
 will have the same dependence on who has sex and who dies.

06:50.100 --> 06:51.820
 Well, that's the problem with immortality.

06:51.820 --> 06:55.980
 How are we going to clear out the old

06:55.980 --> 06:59.260
 to make room for the new, which is kind of a,

07:00.400 --> 07:03.420
 it's like a framework of adaptability

07:03.420 --> 07:04.560
 to changing environments.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.620
 So as long as the environment is changing,

07:06.620 --> 07:09.140
 and it seems to always be,

07:09.140 --> 07:11.340
 because the entirety of the earth system

07:11.340 --> 07:14.140
 is a complex system, it seems like you have to adapt.

07:14.140 --> 07:19.140
 And to adapt, you have to kill off the stubborn old ideas.

07:19.500 --> 07:23.940
 And unless there's a way to like not become stubborn and old,

07:23.940 --> 07:28.940
 but it feels like the nature of wisdom is stubborn and old.

07:30.180 --> 07:32.160
 Like that's what wisdom is.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.520
 It's like the lessons of life,

07:34.520 --> 07:37.300
 the lessons of experience solidified.

07:37.300 --> 07:39.420
 And the solidification is the thing

07:39.420 --> 07:43.380
 that actually prevents you from reinventing yourself

07:43.380 --> 07:47.320
 to adapt to the new changing conditions.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.980
 But then again, why not have that both of those modes?

07:49.980 --> 07:51.620
 Like have two minds and one person,

07:51.620 --> 07:55.080
 one immortal person that like in the morning,

07:55.080 --> 07:56.580
 they act like a teenager,

07:56.580 --> 07:59.960
 in the evening they act like a old wise man.

07:59.960 --> 08:00.900
 That's possible.

08:00.900 --> 08:05.900
 So you see, you can imagine within one mind both modes,

08:07.200 --> 08:08.380
 but those are required.

08:08.380 --> 08:11.740
 You have to have the ability

08:11.740 --> 08:13.800
 to completely reinvent yourself,

08:13.800 --> 08:17.140
 which is what death does in an ugly way,

08:18.600 --> 08:20.740
 or a beautiful way, depending on your perspective,

08:20.740 --> 08:22.500
 depending whether you take the human perspective

08:22.500 --> 08:25.020
 or the human, the nature's perspective.

08:25.020 --> 08:27.060
 And then you have to have the selection.

08:27.060 --> 08:30.500
 So competition, so sexual selection.

08:30.500 --> 08:33.380
 It's an interesting, interesting little planet we got.

08:33.380 --> 08:37.020
 What's the weirdest part, function, concept, idea

08:37.020 --> 08:38.540
 about the human body to you?

08:38.540 --> 08:40.640
 We'll talk about fascinating details,

08:40.640 --> 08:45.640
 but I should say for people that should read your book,

08:46.620 --> 08:48.940
 they will come face to face with the fact

08:48.940 --> 08:51.380
 that you do not shy away from the weird

08:51.380 --> 08:53.460
 and the wonderful of the human body.

08:53.460 --> 08:57.540
 It's like, it's fun, but it's honest.

08:57.540 --> 09:02.540
 So given that, sorry to make you pick one of your children,

09:03.220 --> 09:06.580
 but what's the weirdest one, would you say?

09:06.580 --> 09:09.080
 The weirdest body part.

09:09.080 --> 09:12.460
 Or concept or function.

09:12.460 --> 09:16.380
 So the chapters, you divide it up kind of into parts,

09:16.380 --> 09:19.460
 but there could be a thread that connects all of them,

09:19.460 --> 09:23.980
 the weirdness, maybe, or maybe the texture of the substance.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.980
 It could be the liquids, the solids, I don't know.

09:26.980 --> 09:29.220
 Definitely every body part and bodily fluid

09:29.220 --> 09:33.000
 has their own kind of both gross and fascinating aspects.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.060
 That's probably why I'm a generalist as a doctor

09:36.060 --> 09:38.700
 and couldn't just, as you said, pick one of my children,

09:38.700 --> 09:41.000
 become a specialist, because I like them all.

09:42.560 --> 09:44.980
 I feel like one of the strangest concepts

09:44.980 --> 09:49.100
 about the human body is that kind of the aspects of it

09:49.100 --> 09:51.620
 that are the most universal, that we all do,

09:51.620 --> 09:54.400
 are the most taboo socially.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.560
 I wouldn't have expected that if I had, you know,

09:56.560 --> 09:58.700
 just looked from the outside, like what we do

09:58.700 --> 10:00.940
 in the bathroom, what we do in the bedroom,

10:00.940 --> 10:04.940
 what we do to our own genitals, what we do to our,

10:04.940 --> 10:07.540
 you know, quote unquote, private parts, they're private,

10:07.540 --> 10:10.340
 even though it's sort of the thing that we all have

10:10.340 --> 10:13.500
 in common is the most we try to hide from other people

10:13.500 --> 10:15.500
 and don't talk about in polite company.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.820
 I mean, it makes sense as a human living in this society,

10:17.820 --> 10:20.140
 but from the outside, it sort of might be surprising.

10:20.140 --> 10:21.740
 How do you make sense of that if you put on

10:21.740 --> 10:23.900
 your Sigmund Freud hat?

10:23.900 --> 10:28.900
 The thing we all do, why do we make that a taboo thing?

10:28.900 --> 10:30.860
 Is it because we like taboos?

10:30.860 --> 10:35.720
 Maybe we get off, or maybe our kinks as humans

10:35.720 --> 10:38.940
 is to have taboos, and it's kind of efficient

10:38.940 --> 10:41.920
 to have taboos about the things that everybody does.

10:41.920 --> 10:45.660
 Like, you can make walking taboo or something, I don't know.

10:45.660 --> 10:48.300
 But just, maybe that's what we love,

10:48.300 --> 10:52.220
 that's what's exciting to us, is the forbidden.

10:52.220 --> 10:54.780
 I think, yes, society loves rules, for sure.

10:54.780 --> 10:57.820
 They love, some societies more than others.

10:57.820 --> 11:00.260
 You know, they love controlling how you think

11:00.260 --> 11:02.700
 and what you do in public versus in private.

11:02.700 --> 11:05.180
 You know, there's a lot of societies where, for instance,

11:05.180 --> 11:07.140
 parents have sex in front of children.

11:08.180 --> 11:10.900
 Not, you know, for instance, like in traditional

11:10.900 --> 11:14.680
 Inupiat Eskimo societies, that was sort of normal.

11:14.680 --> 11:15.580
 I mean, but what are you gonna do,

11:15.580 --> 11:17.840
 go outside in the middle of the winter in the Arctic

11:17.840 --> 11:18.760
 and do it out there?

11:18.760 --> 11:19.600
 Of course not.

11:19.600 --> 11:22.580
 So, you know, there's different taboos

11:22.580 --> 11:23.780
 in different societies.

11:23.780 --> 11:25.260
 Some taboos make perfect sense.

11:25.260 --> 11:28.580
 Some taboos are even public health measures,

11:28.580 --> 11:32.060
 you know, like, as I talk in the book about in India,

11:32.060 --> 11:35.700
 where they, you know, the hands are symmetric, as you said,

11:35.700 --> 11:38.500
 but in Indian culture, and the left hand is taboo,

11:38.500 --> 11:41.780
 and the right hand is what you use for shaking hands,

11:41.780 --> 11:44.100
 for eating, for other things, and the left hand

11:44.100 --> 11:47.560
 is the dirty hand that you use for wiping your own bottom.

11:47.560 --> 11:49.420
 You know, that's the toilet paper is your left hand.

11:49.420 --> 11:52.780
 So, while the body is anatomically symmetric,

11:52.780 --> 11:56.460
 the taboo creates this pretty intense asymmetry.

11:56.460 --> 11:57.540
 But for a good reason, you know,

11:57.540 --> 11:58.940
 yet you probably shouldn't be shaking hands

11:58.940 --> 12:01.220
 with other people with the same hand that you use

12:01.220 --> 12:02.240
 to kind of clean your bottom.

12:02.240 --> 12:05.500
 So in that sense, it makes sense.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.380
 Yeah, maybe the roots of it makes sense,

12:07.380 --> 12:10.700
 but the way it propagates, especially as the times change,

12:10.700 --> 12:13.320
 might not, because you can wash your hands.

12:14.380 --> 12:16.200
 But the taboo remains.

12:16.200 --> 12:19.160
 Right, society is very slow to change.

12:19.160 --> 12:21.660
 What is the most fascinating part, function,

12:21.660 --> 12:23.860
 or concept in the human body?

12:23.860 --> 12:28.780
 So, you know, something that fills you with awe.

12:30.420 --> 12:32.540
 I guess the most obvious one is the brain,

12:32.540 --> 12:36.660
 partly because it's so, you know, sort of poorly understood,

12:36.660 --> 12:39.740
 though we understand more than we ever have in the past.

12:39.740 --> 12:41.580
 There's still so much that we don't understand

12:41.580 --> 12:44.580
 about how the lump of matter in our skulls

12:44.580 --> 12:46.620
 kind of creates this subjective experience

12:46.620 --> 12:49.700
 that we all kind of understand quite viscerally.

12:50.700 --> 12:51.580
 That's an easy one.

12:51.580 --> 12:54.340
 I would say the kidneys are an underappreciated organ.

12:55.620 --> 12:58.580
 The way they tinker with the bloodstream,

12:58.580 --> 13:01.060
 raise levels of this, lower levels of that,

13:01.060 --> 13:05.620
 kind of our entire lives from inside the womb until we die

13:05.620 --> 13:07.500
 is just really incredible.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.180
 And when you look at how much energy

13:09.180 --> 13:10.540
 different organs consume,

13:10.540 --> 13:13.440
 the brain and the kidneys are two of the biggest ones,

13:13.440 --> 13:16.600
 because the brain obviously in us is always active,

13:16.600 --> 13:17.980
 and controlling parts of the body,

13:17.980 --> 13:21.040
 but the kidneys are just consuming a ton of energy

13:21.040 --> 13:21.880
 to do what they do.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.220
 They're kind of the unsung hero of the body,

13:24.220 --> 13:26.060
 relegated to the back of the abdomen,

13:26.060 --> 13:28.400
 like some forgotten organ, but they are great.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.980
 I did consider being a nephrologist,

13:29.980 --> 13:31.120
 which is a kidney specialist,

13:31.120 --> 13:33.140
 because I was so taken with the kidneys,

13:33.140 --> 13:35.240
 but decided I like all the organs,

13:35.240 --> 13:36.540
 so couldn't pick just one.

13:37.580 --> 13:40.540
 So your book is ordered in a particular way.

13:40.540 --> 13:47.180
 It's throat, heart, feces, genitals, liver, pineal gland,

13:47.180 --> 13:54.180
 brain, skin, urine, fat, lungs, eyes, mucus,

13:54.180 --> 13:57.260
 fingers and toes, and blood.

13:57.260 --> 13:58.100
 All right.

13:59.060 --> 14:02.180
 First of all, great chapter titles.

14:03.120 --> 14:06.500
 Is there a reason for this ordering, or is it all madness?

14:06.500 --> 14:09.120
 There's a few different reasons that went into it.

14:09.120 --> 14:13.740
 I did wanna start with the throat for the reason

14:13.740 --> 14:18.100
 that it kind of presents the topic of death,

14:18.100 --> 14:20.600
 which is sort of obviously very important

14:20.600 --> 14:23.120
 in the training of a physician, in the career of physician.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.580
 It's a big part of what I deal with.

14:25.580 --> 14:27.900
 On the first day of medical school,

14:27.900 --> 14:30.220
 we started the dissection of a cadaver

14:30.220 --> 14:32.040
 in the class called anatomy lab.

14:32.040 --> 14:34.940
 And so in a way, we were kind of thrown right in there

14:34.940 --> 14:38.780
 in the beginning, like this is the end of the human story.

14:38.780 --> 14:40.700
 Understand this, and then we sort of backed up

14:40.700 --> 14:43.780
 to the beginning with embryology and reproduction and stuff.

14:43.780 --> 14:47.060
 So it's kind of like we got, and I got thrown into that

14:47.060 --> 14:48.820
 right away, right in the beginning,

14:48.820 --> 14:50.260
 kind of like here's a dead body.

14:50.260 --> 14:52.460
 Now start cutting it apart and learn the name

14:52.460 --> 14:54.940
 and function of absolutely every bit of flesh.

14:54.940 --> 14:58.480
 How did that change you, that first experience

14:58.480 --> 15:01.740
 with the cold honesty of human biology?

15:01.740 --> 15:02.940
 Right, that's exactly what it was,

15:02.940 --> 15:05.220
 is cold honesty about kind of the story

15:05.220 --> 15:06.740
 of each individual human body.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.300
 It has an end, and that's it.

15:09.300 --> 15:12.140
 I think that, well, actually before the end

15:12.140 --> 15:14.360
 of that first day, so what we did on that first day

15:14.360 --> 15:16.480
 was study the superficial muscles of the back,

15:16.480 --> 15:19.420
 like the lats or latissimus dorsi and some other muscles.

15:19.420 --> 15:21.420
 We cut through the skin of the back.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.040
 My cadaver was laying face down on this metal gurney.

15:24.040 --> 15:25.920
 We pulled back the kind of plastic sheets

15:25.920 --> 15:28.340
 that would keep him moist for the next four months

15:28.340 --> 15:31.140
 as we dissected him, cut through the skin on his back,

15:31.140 --> 15:33.400
 and then started dissecting through the superficial muscles

15:33.400 --> 15:34.240
 of the back.

15:34.240 --> 15:36.540
 And that was really all we saw that first day.

15:36.540 --> 15:38.700
 We didn't get any deeper, didn't enter the abdominal

15:38.700 --> 15:41.460
 or chest cavity to see internal organs,

15:41.460 --> 15:44.580
 but I was so fascinated with this sort of

15:44.580 --> 15:48.060
 behind the scenes look at how things work in the body,

15:48.060 --> 15:50.420
 how you move your arms, how you arch your back.

15:50.420 --> 15:52.540
 You know, these are the muscles that do it

15:52.540 --> 15:54.780
 that I decided I wanted to donate my own body

15:54.780 --> 15:56.300
 for the same purpose.

15:56.300 --> 15:57.980
 So I made that decision literally

15:57.980 --> 16:00.180
 before the end of that first day of class,

16:00.180 --> 16:02.980
 and I'm still sticking to it.

16:02.980 --> 16:05.440
 So someday there'll be a medical student

16:05.440 --> 16:09.340
 that can watch and listen to this podcast

16:09.340 --> 16:11.480
 while dissecting your body.

16:11.480 --> 16:12.320
 It could happen.

16:12.320 --> 16:13.980
 They might not know that that person

16:13.980 --> 16:15.220
 they're listening to on the podcast

16:15.220 --> 16:17.140
 will be the carcass in front of them,

16:17.140 --> 16:18.980
 but we never learned anything.

16:18.980 --> 16:20.160
 The universe will know.

16:20.160 --> 16:21.000
 The universe will know.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.780
 And they will acknowledge the irony or the humor,

16:24.780 --> 16:26.500
 the absurdity of that.

16:26.500 --> 16:27.780
 The universe will chuckle,

16:27.780 --> 16:29.900
 but the medical student won't know

16:29.900 --> 16:31.920
 because they never, as I did not,

16:31.920 --> 16:35.740
 learn any personal information about the person,

16:35.740 --> 16:37.780
 only what I could glean from looking inside them,

16:37.780 --> 16:39.020
 which actually tells you quite a bit.

16:39.020 --> 16:40.180
 I knew he was a smoker.

16:40.180 --> 16:41.900
 I knew he had coronary artery disease.

16:41.900 --> 16:44.020
 You know, you get a window into,

16:44.020 --> 16:45.020
 I knew he was overweight.

16:45.020 --> 16:46.680
 You get a window into people's lives

16:46.680 --> 16:49.620
 just by looking in their bodies after death.

16:49.620 --> 16:53.900
 Other cadavers in the lab, not my own,

16:53.900 --> 16:55.880
 or I shared one with three other students,

16:55.880 --> 16:58.980
 but other cadavers, some had metal joints,

16:58.980 --> 17:00.100
 like a knee replacement.

17:00.100 --> 17:01.480
 Some had a kidney missing.

17:01.480 --> 17:02.900
 So they probably,

17:02.900 --> 17:04.480
 and we could tell it was surgically removed,

17:04.480 --> 17:07.020
 not that he was born with one.

17:07.020 --> 17:08.980
 And we could tell that he probably had a kidney tumor

17:08.980 --> 17:10.100
 or cancer that was removed.

17:10.100 --> 17:12.580
 So you do get an insight into people's lives

17:12.580 --> 17:16.060
 from picking them apart after they're dead,

17:16.060 --> 17:17.260
 but you don't know their name

17:17.260 --> 17:19.580
 or what podcast they've been on.

17:19.580 --> 17:22.840
 So as the book title says, Unseen Body,

17:23.780 --> 17:27.860
 so it tells some kind of story of your life.

17:27.860 --> 17:30.900
 So it does capture the decisions you've made in your life,

17:30.900 --> 17:32.460
 the things you've done,

17:32.460 --> 17:37.460
 that might be kind of secret to that person

17:37.500 --> 17:41.700
 and maybe to a few others that knew him or her well.

17:41.700 --> 17:42.860
 It's so fascinating.

17:42.860 --> 17:46.020
 So what kind of things can it reveal?

17:46.020 --> 17:49.860
 Like what kind of choices in terms of the injuries,

17:49.860 --> 17:53.420
 the catastrophic events,

17:53.420 --> 17:56.900
 the lifestyle choices of smoking and diet

17:56.900 --> 17:57.900
 and all those kinds of things?

17:57.900 --> 17:59.820
 What can you see?

17:59.820 --> 18:03.460
 What kind of history can you see about the human before you?

18:03.460 --> 18:06.580
 So all those things you mentioned are things you can see.

18:06.580 --> 18:08.220
 Take the skin, for example, right?

18:08.220 --> 18:11.900
 Most things that happen to us leave a mark,

18:11.900 --> 18:15.360
 as I say, kind of a story written in the language of scar

18:15.360 --> 18:16.980
 where it tells you injuries you've had.

18:16.980 --> 18:19.060
 And same thing with animals.

18:19.060 --> 18:21.320
 I've seen deer hides that have marks

18:21.320 --> 18:23.740
 that look like they're made by maybe a barbed wire fence,

18:23.740 --> 18:24.580
 something like that.

18:24.580 --> 18:27.900
 You can tell, sometimes it's conjecture,

18:27.900 --> 18:30.060
 but you can sort of imagine what might've happened

18:30.060 --> 18:30.900
 to cause that.

18:30.900 --> 18:32.640
 Perhaps two bucks were fighting

18:32.640 --> 18:34.780
 and one got injured with an antler.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.460
 And the same with humans.

18:36.460 --> 18:37.660
 I have scars on my body,

18:37.660 --> 18:40.960
 and when I notice them, I remember what happened.

18:40.960 --> 18:44.180
 I got a big cut on my hand when I was 13,

18:44.180 --> 18:45.100
 and it's still there,

18:45.100 --> 18:48.940
 and I remember what happened every time I look at it.

18:48.940 --> 18:52.860
 And so in that way, only I might know that story,

18:52.860 --> 18:54.820
 but other people, when they dissect me

18:54.820 --> 18:56.060
 and notice the same scars,

18:56.060 --> 18:58.100
 they can kind of, it can fire their imagination

18:58.100 --> 19:00.140
 as my cadaver, you know, did for me.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.780
 They know that there is a story there.

19:02.780 --> 19:03.980
 That's such an interesting way

19:03.980 --> 19:05.920
 that the skin does tell a story,

19:07.020 --> 19:09.740
 both tattoos and scars.

19:09.740 --> 19:10.580
 Right.

19:10.580 --> 19:12.100
 Some of the fun you've had

19:12.100 --> 19:14.140
 and some of the damage you've done.

19:14.140 --> 19:14.980
 Right.

19:14.980 --> 19:16.940
 And even when I evaluate a patient,

19:16.940 --> 19:20.540
 I can use scars to help me make medical decisions.

19:20.540 --> 19:22.820
 So for instance, someone that comes in with abdominal pain

19:22.820 --> 19:24.280
 into the emergency room,

19:24.280 --> 19:26.060
 you can see scars on their abdomen

19:26.060 --> 19:27.420
 that tell you about, you know,

19:27.420 --> 19:30.620
 the past kind of activities of a surgeon, perhaps.

19:30.620 --> 19:33.420
 I know, I recognize the scars that are left

19:33.420 --> 19:35.220
 when someone has their gallbladder removed,

19:35.220 --> 19:37.460
 the scars when someone has their appendix removed,

19:37.460 --> 19:38.940
 maybe when someone's had a hysterectomy,

19:38.940 --> 19:42.380
 and that can tell you what it might be or what it isn't.

19:42.380 --> 19:43.980
 You know, if someone doesn't have an appendix,

19:43.980 --> 19:46.640
 their abdominal pain's not appendicitis, end of story.

19:46.640 --> 19:49.740
 So in that way, I'm sort of looking at these,

19:49.740 --> 19:52.740
 the tracks or the footprints of past surgeries

19:52.740 --> 19:55.300
 to tell me what might and might not be the cause

19:55.300 --> 19:56.480
 of this patient's abdominal pain,

19:56.480 --> 19:58.220
 which is kind of my main job in the ER

19:58.220 --> 20:00.660
 is figuring out what's causing it and to help them.

20:01.660 --> 20:05.540
 Is there ways to get more data about the human body

20:05.540 --> 20:08.760
 as we look into the future of medicine biology

20:08.760 --> 20:11.260
 that will be helpful to fill in some of the gaps

20:11.260 --> 20:12.680
 of the story?

20:12.680 --> 20:17.120
 So, you know, you have companies,

20:17.120 --> 20:20.580
 you have research that looks at, you know,

20:20.580 --> 20:23.540
 collection of blood over long periods of time

20:23.540 --> 20:26.780
 to see sort of, you know, paint the picture

20:26.780 --> 20:28.120
 of what's happening in your body,

20:28.120 --> 20:29.980
 mostly to help with lifestyle decisions,

20:29.980 --> 20:33.500
 but also just, you know, to anticipate things

20:33.500 --> 20:35.420
 that can go wrong and all that kind of stuff.

20:35.420 --> 20:40.020
 Is there, can you just speak to a greater digital world

20:40.020 --> 20:40.860
 that we're stepping in,

20:40.860 --> 20:44.220
 how that can help tell a richer story?

20:45.140 --> 20:48.740
 I certainly think that we have more data

20:48.740 --> 20:50.380
 than we know what to do with right now,

20:50.380 --> 20:54.300
 especially with kind of direct to consumer medical devices,

20:54.300 --> 20:55.900
 you know, smartwatches, et cetera,

20:55.900 --> 20:58.780
 that are just collecting these reams of data.

20:58.780 --> 21:01.220
 I have not seen them put to,

21:01.220 --> 21:04.220
 I think the eventual use that they will.

21:04.220 --> 21:08.420
 I think that the potential is sort of just, you know,

21:08.420 --> 21:11.700
 unimaginable and I hope we're heading into a new age

21:11.700 --> 21:14.420
 where, you know, you can determine, for instance,

21:14.420 --> 21:17.120
 is a person gonna have more of the dangerous side effects

21:17.120 --> 21:19.140
 to a drug based on their genetics

21:19.140 --> 21:22.800
 or are they gonna tolerate one drug better than the other,

21:22.800 --> 21:24.620
 you know, based on their genetics?

21:24.620 --> 21:27.760
 And we are slowly moving into that age

21:27.760 --> 21:29.500
 and especially the age of kind of

21:29.500 --> 21:32.560
 completely synthesizing drugs in the lab,

21:34.080 --> 21:36.260
 you know, much like, for instance,

21:36.260 --> 21:38.020
 some of the COVID vaccines actually,

21:38.020 --> 21:41.140
 like Moderna never had the virus in their lab.

21:41.140 --> 21:42.580
 They made that vaccine completely

21:42.580 --> 21:44.180
 without ever having the virus themselves

21:44.180 --> 21:46.580
 just by having the genome, which is sort of astounding.

21:46.580 --> 21:49.260
 And there's a lot of potential going forward, you know,

21:49.260 --> 21:51.180
 based on that technology and some others.

21:51.180 --> 21:52.020
 Well, I didn't know that.

21:52.020 --> 21:53.980
 So they basically, it's all in the computer,

21:53.980 --> 21:54.980
 it's computational.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.300
 Right, you have the genetic code,

21:56.300 --> 21:57.580
 you have tremendous power,

21:57.580 --> 21:59.900
 even if you don't have the organism itself.

21:59.900 --> 22:04.660
 What do you make of Elizabeth Holmes and efforts like that?

22:04.660 --> 22:09.100
 First of all, I'm a curious,

22:11.840 --> 22:16.300
 I'm drawn to the darkness in human nature

22:16.300 --> 22:18.380
 because that somehow reveals

22:20.420 --> 22:23.180
 the full spectrum of what humans could be.

22:23.180 --> 22:25.540
 So there's a lot of sort of controversial thoughts

22:25.540 --> 22:28.620
 about who she is and her efforts and so on.

22:28.620 --> 22:30.980
 I think you may have even tweeted about it,

22:30.980 --> 22:33.980
 but I've read a lot of your tweets, so I'm now forgetting.

22:33.980 --> 22:37.480
 But what do you make of her and both those efforts

22:37.480 --> 22:42.480
 and the charlatans that sort of snake oil salesmen

22:42.480 --> 22:47.480
 that promise those efforts to do more

22:49.180 --> 22:50.380
 than they currently can?

22:51.300 --> 22:55.020
 I think that her, you know, that goal that she had

22:55.020 --> 22:58.000
 that she created Theranos to try to achieve,

22:58.000 --> 23:01.500
 to use less blood in tests is a very worthy goal

23:01.500 --> 23:04.780
 and a huge frontier that we have not achieved

23:04.780 --> 23:06.240
 and that I hope we will achieve.

23:06.240 --> 23:09.160
 So I understand why, you know,

23:09.160 --> 23:12.200
 someone describes what a huge step forward that would be

23:12.200 --> 23:13.180
 and it would be indeed.

23:13.180 --> 23:15.660
 I understand why people put a ton of money behind it.

23:15.660 --> 23:17.860
 Can you describe what was the promise?

23:17.860 --> 23:20.540
 What are we even talking about with Theranos,

23:20.540 --> 23:22.340
 just for people who don't know?

23:22.340 --> 23:25.580
 So Theranos is a company that was basically started

23:25.580 --> 23:29.700
 to revolutionize the way medical blood tests are done,

23:29.700 --> 23:33.020
 both to use a whole lot less blood in doing it.

23:33.020 --> 23:34.820
 You know, if anyone's ever been to the doctor

23:34.820 --> 23:37.600
 and had five to 10 tubes of blood removed from them,

23:37.600 --> 23:41.460
 it can be quite surprising how much they take out.

23:41.460 --> 23:45.080
 And it's, you know, that's the limitation of our technology

23:45.080 --> 23:46.460
 that we need those volumes of blood

23:46.460 --> 23:47.860
 to run all the tests that we want to.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.560
 And so the promise of Theranos was that perhaps

23:50.560 --> 23:53.140
 with a single drop of blood, we would be able to know

23:53.140 --> 23:57.380
 as much about the person's, the condition of their body

23:57.380 --> 24:00.060
 without drawing all that blood and thereby, you know,

24:00.060 --> 24:02.500
 there would be these devices she was gonna create

24:02.500 --> 24:03.800
 that would sort of do it.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.700
 You put a drop of blood in and it spits out everything

24:05.700 --> 24:07.560
 you ever wanted to know about what's in your bloodstream.

24:07.560 --> 24:09.940
 And in a way that would make it so much easier,

24:09.940 --> 24:11.860
 you know, it could be, you could have one in your home

24:11.860 --> 24:14.300
 theoretically, and you, I don't know why you'd wonder

24:14.300 --> 24:16.240
 what your potassium level is on any given day,

24:16.240 --> 24:18.140
 but you could check if you wanted to.

24:19.020 --> 24:21.340
 And so that goal is very worthy.

24:21.340 --> 24:25.500
 You know, I put that goal up there with the frontier

24:25.500 --> 24:27.620
 of making painkillers that are as good as opioids

24:27.620 --> 24:28.920
 without the addictive quality.

24:28.920 --> 24:30.700
 You know, that would be such a huge revolution

24:30.700 --> 24:32.140
 if we did have that in medicine.

24:32.140 --> 24:34.460
 But, and particularly for me,

24:34.460 --> 24:37.460
 cause I trained in both pediatrics and internal medicine.

24:37.460 --> 24:40.300
 So I learned to care for both children and adults.

24:40.300 --> 24:42.180
 In children, we do draw much less blood.

24:42.180 --> 24:43.900
 They have a much lower blood volume.

24:43.900 --> 24:47.400
 And we use these tiny little tubes to draw their blood.

24:47.400 --> 24:50.040
 And we seemingly get equivalent information

24:50.040 --> 24:52.220
 out of the larger tubes we draw from adults.

24:52.220 --> 24:53.660
 And I'm still unclear to be honest,

24:53.660 --> 24:56.340
 why we can't draw that little amount of blood from adults.

24:56.340 --> 24:58.260
 It seems technically possible.

24:58.260 --> 24:59.440
 I don't know what the barriers are.

24:59.440 --> 25:02.260
 I'm sure there are, or else we'd be doing it.

25:02.260 --> 25:04.860
 But I do think that that is a very important goal.

25:04.860 --> 25:06.100
 And if Theranos had done it,

25:06.100 --> 25:09.000
 it would have really revolutionized the practice of medicine.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.900
 So to return to that cadaver,

25:13.900 --> 25:18.300
 that first day when you got to meet with the dead,

25:18.300 --> 25:21.100
 with a human body that's no longer living.

25:21.100 --> 25:26.100
 So how quickly did it take for you to get used to sort of,

25:27.900 --> 25:31.000
 you said, looking at the surface muscles of the back?

25:31.000 --> 25:34.980
 I mean, that can be overwhelming as a thought.

25:34.980 --> 25:37.460
 And people listening to this that have never dissected

25:37.460 --> 25:40.180
 anything might be overwhelmed by that thought.

25:40.180 --> 25:43.620
 So like, how quickly were you able to get used

25:43.620 --> 25:48.500
 to the brutal honesty of the biology before you?

25:48.500 --> 25:50.260
 For me, it did not take long at all.

25:50.260 --> 25:53.060
 I guess I've never been a squeamish person.

25:53.060 --> 25:55.820
 So for me, it was kind of riveting and fascinating

25:55.820 --> 25:56.960
 right from the first moment.

25:56.960 --> 26:00.240
 But I do know some of my fellow classmates

26:00.240 --> 26:01.780
 did have some trouble with it.

26:01.780 --> 26:05.740
 Some of them I heard had nightmares in the first few weeks

26:05.740 --> 26:08.060
 of anatomy lab.

26:08.060 --> 26:10.620
 But then everyone, as far as I know, got used to it.

26:10.620 --> 26:13.500
 And that was also actually a big lesson for me

26:13.500 --> 26:15.860
 that it's pretty amazing what people can get used to

26:15.860 --> 26:16.700
 in their daily lives.

26:16.700 --> 26:20.180
 And I kind of extrapolated that to people living through war

26:20.180 --> 26:23.220
 and through just terrible situations

26:23.220 --> 26:26.860
 and living under oppressive regimes.

26:26.860 --> 26:30.060
 And it really is amazing what people can get used to,

26:30.060 --> 26:31.500
 almost anything.

26:31.500 --> 26:35.740
 Well, you know, in war, people often come back

26:35.740 --> 26:37.300
 and they have nightmares.

26:37.300 --> 26:38.220
 They suffer through it.

26:38.220 --> 26:39.140
 There's PTSD.

26:39.140 --> 26:42.260
 There's a lot of complicated feelings with that.

26:43.880 --> 26:47.760
 Are echoes of those same complicated feelings possible

26:47.760 --> 26:50.900
 in the case of training to be and becoming a doctor?

26:51.960 --> 26:52.800
 That's a good point.

26:52.800 --> 26:56.340
 Yeah, I think sometimes, just as a barbed wire fence

26:56.340 --> 26:58.580
 can leave a scar on your skin,

26:58.580 --> 27:01.040
 emotional, psychological experiences

27:01.040 --> 27:03.860
 can leave a mark on your brain or your memory.

27:03.860 --> 27:08.860
 And I think that that definitely could be a problem

27:09.740 --> 27:10.760
 in medical training.

27:10.760 --> 27:14.180
 You do see a lot of things that are very shocking,

27:14.180 --> 27:17.000
 very repulsive, things that you'd never forget.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.020
 I know one of those students that had nightmares initially

27:20.020 --> 27:21.460
 went on to be a surgeon.

27:21.460 --> 27:23.820
 So I imagine she's not having the PTSD

27:23.820 --> 27:25.980
 of kind of seeing inside her first dead body

27:25.980 --> 27:28.580
 because she sees inside them all day, every day now.

27:28.580 --> 27:30.180
 But I'm sure it could.

27:30.180 --> 27:34.380
 You know, we go on to see so many kind of grosser

27:34.380 --> 27:37.160
 or more shocking things in medical training

27:37.160 --> 27:38.620
 through medical school and then by working

27:38.620 --> 27:40.460
 with actual living patients,

27:40.460 --> 27:43.540
 not just dead and embalmed bodies.

27:43.540 --> 27:46.640
 So I do think that things can leave a mark,

27:46.640 --> 27:48.980
 but I don't think that initial cadaver

27:48.980 --> 27:50.420
 would be the most traumatic.

27:51.880 --> 27:54.580
 Yeah, but maybe some of that trauma,

27:54.580 --> 27:56.980
 the demons make you a better surgeon,

27:56.980 --> 28:00.540
 just like some of your own psychological trauma

28:00.540 --> 28:03.100
 might make you a better psychiatrist.

28:03.100 --> 28:07.960
 Returning to the ordering, is it order or is it chaos

28:07.960 --> 28:11.620
 to the ordering of the chapters from throat and heart

28:12.480 --> 28:14.340
 and feces and genitals all the way

28:14.340 --> 28:15.860
 to fingers and toes and blood?

28:16.740 --> 28:18.500
 So I did mention that, you know,

28:18.500 --> 28:20.340
 throat was the first one because I kind of wanted

28:20.340 --> 28:24.540
 to throw the reader right into the brutal honesty of death.

28:24.540 --> 28:27.220
 And I followed it up with feces as the third chapter

28:27.220 --> 28:30.220
 and in a way, partly to also throw them right

28:30.220 --> 28:33.980
 into the deep end of how I like discussing parts

28:33.980 --> 28:36.340
 of the body and revealing their gross

28:36.340 --> 28:37.860
 and fascinating aspects.

28:37.860 --> 28:39.620
 So I didn't want to hide anything.

28:39.620 --> 28:41.220
 You know, when you train to be a doctor,

28:41.220 --> 28:44.500
 everything is on the table, literally in the cadaver lab,

28:44.500 --> 28:46.860
 but also just, you know, you deal with blood

28:46.860 --> 28:48.780
 and piss and vomit and feces.

28:48.780 --> 28:51.240
 And that's kind of the medium of your craft.

28:51.240 --> 28:55.300
 And yes, the medium of the craft, that's right.

28:55.300 --> 28:58.840
 Like if you're a painter, this is the paint.

29:00.180 --> 29:01.020
 Exactly.

29:01.020 --> 29:03.340
 And then you have to create a masterpiece with it.

29:04.500 --> 29:06.860
 Like almost like a dance because there's multiple painters.

29:06.860 --> 29:08.860
 One of the painters is the biology.

29:08.860 --> 29:10.360
 So let's return to throat.

29:10.360 --> 29:12.020
 You mentioned it's a weird one.

29:12.020 --> 29:14.740
 So first of all, a friend of mine said,

29:14.740 --> 29:19.620
 I just see humans as like a bunch of holes

29:19.620 --> 29:21.520
 that just walk around.

29:24.060 --> 29:24.900
 Not untrue.

29:25.820 --> 29:27.440
 It's a funny way to look at humans.

29:27.440 --> 29:31.700
 So we have ears, we have nose, we have mouth,

29:31.700 --> 29:36.700
 we have the sexual holes, vagina, penis.

29:36.980 --> 29:40.540
 And then, you know, what's the medical term

29:40.540 --> 29:41.760
 for your asshole?

29:42.700 --> 29:43.540
 Anus.

29:43.540 --> 29:44.360
 Anus, thank you.

29:45.500 --> 29:47.220
 This is a very technical discussion.

29:47.220 --> 29:49.740
 The rectum's further in, don't confuse the two.

29:49.740 --> 29:51.620
 Oh, that's very important.

29:51.620 --> 29:54.020
 Is there a difference between throat and mouth?

29:54.020 --> 29:56.100
 By the way, so when you say throat,

29:56.100 --> 30:00.900
 are we talking about when that hole actually becomes tubular?

30:00.900 --> 30:03.640
 The throat I would count as just sort of the very back

30:03.640 --> 30:07.780
 of the back of the mouth, where the nose also comes down

30:07.780 --> 30:10.480
 and meets it, where the tonsils are and the uvula.

30:11.460 --> 30:13.240
 But you're right that we are a bunch of holes.

30:13.240 --> 30:15.180
 But more accurately, we're a tube, right?

30:15.180 --> 30:18.620
 We start in the womb as kind of this microscopic little disc,

30:18.620 --> 30:21.980
 almost like a flatbread.

30:21.980 --> 30:25.980
 And then we roll almost like a burrito into this tube.

30:25.980 --> 30:27.660
 And we're a simple microscopic tube.

30:27.660 --> 30:30.220
 And from there, we grow into this bigger and bigger tube

30:30.220 --> 30:32.180
 and we become more complicated.

30:32.180 --> 30:35.140
 And each end of the tube does split into various holes.

30:35.140 --> 30:37.180
 So all the holes you mentioned at the front end of the tube,

30:37.180 --> 30:38.380
 the front end of our body, right?

30:38.380 --> 30:42.340
 It splits into the nose, the mouth, the ears, the sinuses,

30:42.340 --> 30:46.060
 the tube to the lungs, which is the windpipe,

30:46.060 --> 30:48.780
 the tube down to the stomach, which is the esophagus.

30:48.780 --> 30:51.860
 And then the other end of the tube splits as well.

30:51.860 --> 30:55.600
 Men end up with two holes and women end up with three holes.

30:56.760 --> 30:59.620
 The urethra, the vagina, and the anus, and men.

30:59.620 --> 31:02.380
 The urethra and kind of the reproductive system,

31:02.380 --> 31:03.380
 they share a hole.

31:03.380 --> 31:05.860
 So I'm learning a lot today.

31:05.860 --> 31:10.200
 It really is incredible that you start from a sperm and an egg

31:10.200 --> 31:12.380
 and you have some DNA information.

31:12.380 --> 31:15.540
 And from that, the building project begins.

31:15.540 --> 31:20.540
 And then what that leads to is like pizza dough

31:20.900 --> 31:24.120
 and then you roll it into a tube.

31:24.120 --> 31:29.120
 And that tube then eventually sort of becomes

31:29.460 --> 31:34.460
 more and more complicated and gets eyes and a brain

31:34.660 --> 31:38.500
 and then can create a Twitter account.

31:38.500 --> 31:43.500
 So it's really incredible that we're just a fancy tube.

31:43.620 --> 31:44.620
 Right, we are.

31:44.620 --> 31:48.200
 And we sprout eyes and a brain and a sense of smell

31:48.200 --> 31:50.820
 and taste pretty much to regulate what comes in

31:50.820 --> 31:52.220
 the front of the tube.

31:52.220 --> 31:55.300
 We don't wanna eat anything dangerous or poisonous.

31:55.300 --> 31:58.500
 We wanna choose what we eat, even choose who we kiss.

31:58.500 --> 32:01.140
 Well, we seem to be motivated by what comes out

32:01.140 --> 32:04.020
 of the tube as well in part.

32:04.020 --> 32:07.900
 That's not just output, it's a feedback mechanism seemingly.

32:07.900 --> 32:11.100
 Like we're also monitoring the functioning of the output.

32:11.100 --> 32:13.100
 We're not just obsessed about the input.

32:14.300 --> 32:15.700
 We're very obsessed with the output.

32:15.700 --> 32:17.940
 You're absolutely right about that.

32:17.940 --> 32:21.460
 People have medical complaints about their output

32:21.460 --> 32:24.880
 very often that are, I never cease to be surprised

32:24.880 --> 32:28.060
 by a new kind of complaint or observation about the output.

32:28.060 --> 32:32.360
 I think people have gone to wars over the output

32:32.360 --> 32:35.020
 and maybe sometimes the lack of the output

32:35.020 --> 32:38.580
 or the desire for output for the particular other humans

32:39.460 --> 32:44.380
 that you fancy, the brain and the eyes that sprouted

32:44.380 --> 32:48.140
 somehow convinced the rest of the body

32:48.140 --> 32:51.820
 that this one particular other tube is fanciful.

32:51.820 --> 32:53.440
 So you're going to go to major wars

32:53.440 --> 32:57.460
 and lead global suffering because of the fancy

32:57.460 --> 33:01.660
 and the desire for additional output with the other tube.

33:01.660 --> 33:06.660
 Okay, so on the throat, that part of the tube,

33:09.500 --> 33:13.580
 is it, you said the design is not,

33:13.580 --> 33:16.260
 you could have thought of maybe a little bit better options

33:16.260 --> 33:18.340
 because it's too multifunctional.

33:18.340 --> 33:20.820
 Is that, can you sort of elaborate

33:20.820 --> 33:23.780
 on the multifunctional nature of this part?

33:23.780 --> 33:26.460
 Are a lot of parts of the human body multifunctional

33:26.460 --> 33:29.500
 or do you find that more specialization

33:29.500 --> 33:32.260
 is going to get the job done better?

33:32.260 --> 33:34.060
 There is a lot of organs, for instance,

33:34.060 --> 33:35.780
 do have multiple functions.

33:35.780 --> 33:39.540
 The pancreas is like two organs in one.

33:39.540 --> 33:42.460
 One secretes hormones like insulin into the bloodstream

33:42.460 --> 33:45.940
 and the other aspect of it secretes digestive enzymes

33:45.940 --> 33:49.180
 into the gut to help you digest and absorb food.

33:49.180 --> 33:51.060
 The liver is like 15 organs in one.

33:51.060 --> 33:53.840
 It's just amazing how many different things it does.

33:53.840 --> 33:57.500
 But the throat, so basically the problem with the throat

33:57.500 --> 33:59.940
 is as I said, we have two tubes

33:59.940 --> 34:01.880
 that are right next to each other in the throat.

34:01.880 --> 34:05.420
 One is for food, drink, saliva, mucus, snot,

34:05.420 --> 34:07.120
 whatever you're gonna swallow,

34:07.120 --> 34:09.300
 all of that stuff must go down the esophagus,

34:09.300 --> 34:11.460
 the food tube and end up in the stomach.

34:11.460 --> 34:14.460
 And right next to the esophagus millimeters away

34:14.460 --> 34:16.340
 is the windpipe or the trachea,

34:16.340 --> 34:18.420
 which goes down to the lungs.

34:18.420 --> 34:21.900
 And your throat does these daily gymnastics

34:21.900 --> 34:26.360
 to keep everything but air out of the windpipe

34:26.360 --> 34:30.240
 because you slip up once and you can die.

34:30.240 --> 34:32.820
 You can choke, you laugh or speak while eating

34:32.820 --> 34:35.100
 and it's curtains, unfortunately.

34:35.100 --> 34:37.400
 So it seems like every aspect of the body

34:37.400 --> 34:38.820
 when I was learning about it in med school

34:38.820 --> 34:42.660
 seemed so brilliant and so perfectly designed

34:42.660 --> 34:45.500
 by evolution or whoever you might think designed it

34:46.340 --> 34:50.560
 to favor survival, to enhance life,

34:51.660 --> 34:53.700
 but the throat seemed the opposite.

34:53.700 --> 34:56.700
 It seemed set up almost for failure.

34:56.700 --> 35:00.380
 And we developed all these mechanisms as a compensation.

35:00.380 --> 35:04.020
 We have the gag reflex whenever food or something

35:04.020 --> 35:07.100
 is headed towards your air pipe, your windpipe

35:07.100 --> 35:08.140
 or down to your lungs,

35:08.140 --> 35:10.660
 your throat has this sort of like rejection of it.

35:10.660 --> 35:13.180
 It pushes it away in a gag reflex.

35:13.180 --> 35:14.480
 At the same time, we have a cough,

35:14.480 --> 35:16.380
 which is something our body does

35:16.380 --> 35:19.060
 when something inappropriate does get down the windpipe.

35:19.060 --> 35:22.260
 When we get a little food down the wrong pipe,

35:22.260 --> 35:24.780
 we end up coughing and the coughing does

35:24.780 --> 35:27.340
 usually flush it out and get rid of it.

35:27.340 --> 35:29.940
 We even have something called the mucus elevator

35:29.940 --> 35:33.740
 in our lungs, which is this constant flow of mucus

35:33.740 --> 35:36.700
 up the airways, up to the trachea, dragging with it

35:36.700 --> 35:38.780
 all kinds of particulates that we've inhaled

35:38.780 --> 35:41.220
 and perhaps some food that went down the wrong pipe

35:41.220 --> 35:44.260
 and drags it up into the throat and we swallow it

35:44.260 --> 35:47.120
 kind of unconsciously all day, every day is the truth.

35:47.120 --> 35:50.140
 Even the mechanism of swallowing is super complicated.

35:50.140 --> 35:52.260
 It uses a number of cranial nerves.

35:52.260 --> 35:54.680
 It uses over 15 different muscles.

35:55.540 --> 36:00.340
 It's this coordinated act to keep food out of the airway.

36:00.340 --> 36:02.420
 You can see someone's Adam's apple in their neck

36:02.420 --> 36:05.160
 kind of jump upward when they swallow,

36:05.160 --> 36:09.240
 which helps lift the airway up against the epiglottis,

36:09.240 --> 36:13.000
 which plugs it closed and allows food or swallow drink

36:13.000 --> 36:15.020
 to kind of skirt just past it.

36:15.020 --> 36:17.500
 But every time we swallow, those things do come

36:17.500 --> 36:19.780
 within millimeters of going down the wrong pipe

36:19.780 --> 36:22.420
 and it's just thanks to these kind of compensations,

36:22.420 --> 36:25.020
 these adaptations we have to the danger of the throat

36:25.020 --> 36:26.200
 that keeps us alive.

36:27.300 --> 36:30.380
 As I actually took a sip of water,

36:30.380 --> 36:34.260
 it's kind of, it makes you appreciate

36:34.260 --> 36:36.020
 the wonderful machinery of it all.

36:36.960 --> 36:39.560
 By the way, we have pulled up your Instagram

36:39.560 --> 36:41.060
 that people should follow.

36:41.060 --> 36:44.100
 You have a post about the throat

36:44.100 --> 36:47.620
 and just showing so many different components

36:47.620 --> 36:52.320
 from the tongue to the trachea, the esophagus,

36:52.320 --> 36:54.760
 just the entire machinery of it all.

36:56.460 --> 37:00.420
 The teeth for the chewing, it's so interesting.

37:00.420 --> 37:02.780
 And so a lot of the structure of this,

37:02.780 --> 37:05.460
 the anatomy and the physiology,

37:05.460 --> 37:07.900
 does it echo other mammals?

37:07.900 --> 37:11.300
 Are we just basically borrowing a lot of stuff

37:11.300 --> 37:14.460
 from evolution and maybe making small adjustments

37:14.460 --> 37:17.260
 maybe due to the fact that we're not using our mouth

37:17.260 --> 37:21.560
 to murder things as other predators might?

37:22.460 --> 37:23.740
 We use our thumbs.

37:23.740 --> 37:26.780
 Exactly, we have hands, we don't need to bite them.

37:26.780 --> 37:29.780
 Yeah, there's a lot of overlap between different animals

37:29.780 --> 37:32.900
 which I find very comforting and fascinating.

37:32.900 --> 37:34.660
 Someone asked me, is there any animal

37:34.660 --> 37:36.620
 in which the throat is better designed?

37:36.620 --> 37:38.500
 And my first thought was whales

37:38.500 --> 37:40.700
 because the blowhole's kind of up on the top of their head.

37:40.700 --> 37:44.220
 So I was thinking, oh, maybe they are more separate.

37:44.220 --> 37:46.140
 But when I looked into it, actually no,

37:46.140 --> 37:48.900
 the paths do come very close, just like in us.

37:48.900 --> 37:53.220
 And I saw a paper about some new discovered organ

37:53.220 --> 37:55.300
 that actually helps keep food and drink

37:55.300 --> 37:56.700
 out of the airway in whales

37:56.700 --> 37:58.220
 that they hadn't ever noticed before.

37:58.220 --> 37:59.940
 So it's a different mechanism,

37:59.940 --> 38:02.940
 but the same kind of basic problem is that

38:02.940 --> 38:05.060
 we're tubes and the air tube and food tube

38:05.060 --> 38:06.500
 are right next to each other.

38:06.500 --> 38:07.940
 How well do we understand,

38:07.940 --> 38:10.340
 so just even linger on this little part,

38:10.340 --> 38:13.140
 is there still mysteries about the complexity

38:13.140 --> 38:13.980
 of the system?

38:13.980 --> 38:16.380
 You mentioned just even for swallowing

38:16.380 --> 38:18.500
 all these parts in the brain that are responsible

38:18.500 --> 38:20.700
 and all the different things that have to,

38:20.700 --> 38:22.740
 like an orchestra play together.

38:22.740 --> 38:26.300
 Do we have a good sense from both a medical perspective

38:26.300 --> 38:29.060
 and a biology perspective or is there still mysteries?

38:29.060 --> 38:30.420
 There's definitely still mysteries.

38:30.420 --> 38:32.440
 We understand a lot about, for instance,

38:32.440 --> 38:35.860
 how the swallowing mechanism is coordinated

38:35.860 --> 38:37.140
 in the brainstem,

38:37.140 --> 38:40.100
 sometimes using some higher levels of the brain,

38:40.100 --> 38:42.020
 but it is a very thoughtless thing

38:42.020 --> 38:44.020
 as you mentioned when you drank the water.

38:44.020 --> 38:45.840
 It's not something we have to think about, thankfully,

38:45.840 --> 38:47.740
 or we'd be thinking about it all day.

38:49.080 --> 38:50.140
 There's a lot we don't understand

38:50.140 --> 38:51.440
 about the basic mechanisms,

38:51.440 --> 38:53.980
 perhaps about how the nerves fire

38:53.980 --> 38:58.280
 and how they kind of coordinate on the microscopic level,

38:58.280 --> 39:01.260
 how ions rush into and out of nerve cells

39:01.260 --> 39:03.200
 to kind of create that electrical signal,

39:03.200 --> 39:05.700
 but we sure understand a heck of a lot

39:05.700 --> 39:07.020
 and it's very fascinating.

39:07.020 --> 39:12.020
 So, moving on to chapter two and we'll jump around.

39:12.100 --> 39:17.100
 And you actually said the liver does a lot of things.

39:17.180 --> 39:19.580
 I also saw you retweet something

39:21.100 --> 39:23.420
 where it said, you know,

39:23.420 --> 39:25.900
 showing that the liver is bigger than the heart,

39:25.900 --> 39:28.980
 which is the body or the universe's way of saying

39:28.980 --> 39:31.140
 you should drink more and care less,

39:31.140 --> 39:32.740
 which is a good line.

39:32.740 --> 39:37.500
 So, you give props, like you said, to the kidney,

39:37.500 --> 39:40.580
 to the liver, to the maybe, to the organs,

39:40.580 --> 39:44.020
 to the parts that don't often get as much credit

39:44.020 --> 39:48.340
 as they deserve, but let us go for time to the human heart.

39:50.260 --> 39:51.640
 We get chest pain.

39:52.820 --> 39:55.660
 We talk about it when we talk about love for some reason.

39:55.660 --> 39:58.660
 Why do we talk about the heart when we talk about love?

39:58.660 --> 40:00.060
 There sometimes can actually be

40:00.060 --> 40:01.820
 some chest pain involved in love.

40:01.820 --> 40:03.740
 I remember when I was a med student,

40:03.740 --> 40:06.780
 I was very smitten with another medical student

40:06.780 --> 40:09.260
 who was totally brilliant and beautiful.

40:09.260 --> 40:10.620
 And it actually does cause

40:10.620 --> 40:12.540
 this kind of burning in your chest.

40:12.540 --> 40:13.900
 I don't know what that is.

40:13.900 --> 40:16.020
 I don't think it's from the heart itself.

40:16.020 --> 40:17.740
 I don't know if it was like acid reflux

40:17.740 --> 40:18.580
 because I was so nervous.

40:18.580 --> 40:20.020
 I'm not really sure,

40:20.020 --> 40:22.500
 but I definitely felt something in my chest

40:22.500 --> 40:23.660
 whenever I saw her.

40:23.660 --> 40:24.700
 I don't know what that is,

40:24.700 --> 40:26.740
 but you could see why someone might think,

40:26.740 --> 40:28.140
 oh, you know, maybe it is your heart.

40:28.140 --> 40:30.620
 That's kind of the most prominent organ in your chest.

40:30.620 --> 40:32.380
 When people come to the ER with chest pain,

40:32.380 --> 40:33.940
 the big question is, is it my heart?

40:33.940 --> 40:36.900
 And that's my main job is figuring out if it is or not.

40:36.900 --> 40:38.120
 So I could see why.

40:39.460 --> 40:42.260
 The way ancients saw the functions of different organs

40:42.260 --> 40:46.300
 is fascinating, but often hard to explain.

40:46.300 --> 40:48.380
 Would it be fair to say

40:48.380 --> 40:51.100
 that if you look at the entirety of human history,

40:51.100 --> 40:55.460
 the way most people die has to do with the heart?

40:55.460 --> 40:58.100
 Well, like in America today,

40:58.100 --> 41:01.420
 cardiovascular disease and coronary artery disease

41:01.420 --> 41:02.540
 is one of the most common,

41:02.540 --> 41:04.780
 perhaps the most common cause of death.

41:04.780 --> 41:07.260
 You know, 100 years ago, 200 years ago,

41:07.260 --> 41:08.420
 it was probably not.

41:08.420 --> 41:09.660
 People were not living as long

41:09.660 --> 41:11.380
 and people were dying of infections

41:11.380 --> 41:14.180
 that we tend to die less of these days.

41:14.180 --> 41:17.880
 Sure, that's true, but in terms of things to stab,

41:18.940 --> 41:20.860
 so I'm trying to sort of introspect

41:20.860 --> 41:24.540
 like why talk about the heart and love?

41:24.540 --> 41:28.220
 My thought would be that it's because

41:28.220 --> 41:31.740
 the heart was seen as the most important organism.

41:31.740 --> 41:35.740
 It would be like the origin of life comes from the heart.

41:35.740 --> 41:38.340
 The originator of life and the way you figure that out

41:38.340 --> 41:40.620
 from sort of an ancient perspective

41:40.620 --> 41:43.780
 is when you stab things,

41:43.780 --> 41:46.120
 what is likely to lead to issues?

41:46.120 --> 41:48.140
 It's like, it's possible to imagine

41:48.140 --> 41:50.980
 that the brain is not as special as we might think

41:50.980 --> 41:54.620
 from when you don't understand modern biology

41:54.620 --> 41:58.660
 or physiology or neuroscience, all those kinds of things,

41:58.660 --> 42:01.960
 especially because pain, you know, it's painless too,

42:02.860 --> 42:05.560
 if you stab it, the brain, I mean.

42:07.500 --> 42:09.880
 Yeah, anyway, so that's really interesting.

42:09.880 --> 42:13.460
 I'm sure there's a kind of a poetic answer to

42:13.460 --> 42:15.240
 maybe the way people wrote about it,

42:15.240 --> 42:20.240
 but what to you is the wisdom in the design of the heart?

42:20.240 --> 42:22.440
 I mean, the main function of the heart basically

42:22.440 --> 42:25.240
 is to push blood through the cardiovascular system,

42:25.240 --> 42:27.760
 through the branching blood vessels

42:27.760 --> 42:30.380
 to feed every cell in the body.

42:30.380 --> 42:32.760
 You know, when I believe our ancestors

42:32.760 --> 42:34.640
 started off as single celled organisms

42:34.640 --> 42:37.300
 floating in some ancient brew,

42:37.300 --> 42:39.360
 and they were surrounded by the medium

42:39.360 --> 42:41.040
 that would bring them all the nutrients they needed,

42:41.040 --> 42:42.520
 so there's no issues there.

42:42.520 --> 42:45.360
 And then once you start getting multicellular organisms,

42:45.360 --> 42:47.760
 the kind of that are thicker and the ones on the inside

42:47.760 --> 42:50.560
 aren't in contact with that sort of nutritious brew

42:50.560 --> 42:52.280
 that they're growing in,

42:52.280 --> 42:54.720
 you kind of need a way to distribute those nutrients

42:54.720 --> 42:56.560
 to every cell, and so that's what the heart

42:56.560 --> 42:58.560
 and the branching vascular tree do.

42:58.560 --> 43:02.440
 So the heart, you know, it's the biggest disconnect

43:02.440 --> 43:04.560
 between how the organs talked about in poetry

43:04.560 --> 43:06.840
 and through history versus its actual function

43:06.840 --> 43:07.800
 is probably the heart,

43:07.800 --> 43:11.000
 because we ascribe all these things like love and passion

43:11.000 --> 43:13.240
 and life itself sometimes to the heart,

43:13.240 --> 43:15.720
 but actually it's just a simple mechanical pump,

43:15.720 --> 43:17.160
 you know, that's all it is.

43:17.160 --> 43:18.600
 I don't wanna downplay it, it's amazing,

43:18.600 --> 43:20.340
 but you know, it just pushes.

43:20.340 --> 43:22.480
 It fills with blood and then squeezes it,

43:22.480 --> 43:23.500
 fills with blood and squeezes it,

43:23.500 --> 43:25.180
 and just that squeezing, that pushing,

43:25.180 --> 43:27.680
 creates the blood pressure that you need

43:27.680 --> 43:29.680
 to get blood to every cell in your body,

43:29.680 --> 43:31.120
 especially when you're standing upright

43:31.120 --> 43:32.680
 to get blood to your brain,

43:32.680 --> 43:35.440
 you need a certain amount of pressure to get it up there.

43:35.440 --> 43:39.240
 Isn't it amazing to you how much volume of blood

43:39.240 --> 43:42.920
 just gets pushed through by this pump?

43:42.920 --> 43:45.080
 Absolutely, they say every red blood cell

43:45.080 --> 43:47.240
 takes about five minutes to circulate

43:47.240 --> 43:48.760
 and come back to the heart,

43:48.760 --> 43:52.040
 and that circulation kind of starts in the womb

43:52.040 --> 43:55.520
 and continues kind of until the moment that we die,

43:55.520 --> 43:56.820
 but the volume is tremendous,

43:56.820 --> 44:00.120
 and it can never take a break, basically.

44:00.120 --> 44:03.840
 And it's sort of propagating all kinds of stuff

44:03.840 --> 44:06.080
 throughout the body, it's a delivery mechanism,

44:06.080 --> 44:09.680
 blood for all kinds of good stuff and bad stuff,

44:09.680 --> 44:13.760
 nutrition, drugs, all that.

44:13.760 --> 44:15.200
 Right, medications too.

44:15.200 --> 44:19.000
 Medications, such a fascinating design.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.040
 And it also takes the waste away,

44:21.040 --> 44:22.920
 it kind of brings the nutritious stuff,

44:22.920 --> 44:24.600
 brings the nutrients, especially oxygen,

44:24.600 --> 44:26.840
 but many other things, and then it also,

44:26.840 --> 44:29.060
 as it passes the cell, takes the cell's waste,

44:29.060 --> 44:30.960
 so it's sort of the fresh water

44:30.960 --> 44:33.480
 and the sewage system in one.

44:33.480 --> 44:38.480
 So about blood, what do you use fascinating about blood?

44:38.840 --> 44:41.760
 So we talk about the pump that spreads the blood,

44:41.760 --> 44:43.200
 but the blood itself.

44:43.200 --> 44:44.920
 Right, so the blood itself is sort of,

44:44.920 --> 44:48.040
 I mean, it's the most important bodily fluid, of course.

44:48.040 --> 44:50.400
 From moment to moment, every cell in the body

44:50.400 --> 44:54.160
 needs a flow of blood to bring it,

44:54.160 --> 44:56.120
 most importantly, oxygen, but also, again,

44:56.120 --> 44:57.980
 all the other nutrients and to take away waste,

44:57.980 --> 45:00.220
 and if that stops for even a few moments,

45:00.220 --> 45:02.360
 you can be in big trouble.

45:02.360 --> 45:05.740
 So blood is sort of the most important medium.

45:05.740 --> 45:09.280
 It's also, doctors use it to kind of evaluate the body.

45:09.280 --> 45:12.580
 It does have this kind of all seeing quality to it,

45:12.580 --> 45:16.740
 where we can evaluate organs through the blood.

45:16.740 --> 45:18.920
 I can tell you about your liver, your heart, your kidney

45:18.920 --> 45:21.240
 just by taking a sample of your blood.

45:21.240 --> 45:23.860
 So it's sort of like this crystal ball in a way,

45:23.860 --> 45:26.000
 and we use it kind of all the time

45:26.000 --> 45:29.080
 to assess someone's health, to assess their disease.

45:29.080 --> 45:33.080
 Is it also the attack vector for diseases,

45:34.540 --> 45:37.720
 for bacteria, for viruses and all that kind of stuff?

45:37.720 --> 45:40.500
 So viruses seem to attack either the throat,

45:40.500 --> 45:41.520
 maybe you can correct me,

45:41.520 --> 45:44.140
 but they seem to attack different parts of the body,

45:44.140 --> 45:46.180
 depending on how easy it is to access

45:46.180 --> 45:50.560
 and how easy it is to get in deep,

45:50.560 --> 45:52.280
 depending on what you prefer.

45:52.280 --> 45:54.400
 If you want to do a little bit of hard work,

45:54.400 --> 45:55.880
 but you get in deep,

45:55.880 --> 45:58.520
 or you don't want to do the hard work,

45:58.520 --> 45:59.840
 but you don't get in deep,

45:59.840 --> 46:01.320
 those are the choices viruses have.

46:01.320 --> 46:04.340
 But is blood one of the sort of attack vectors?

46:04.340 --> 46:07.340
 What's like, if you were trying to break into the human body,

46:07.340 --> 46:12.340
 like a parasite, a virus, a bacteria, how would you do it?

46:13.040 --> 46:16.240
 Like what would be the attack vectors you would explore?

46:16.240 --> 46:18.140
 Right, so you got to look for the body's weaknesses,

46:18.140 --> 46:21.040
 of course, you know, we have inherent weaknesses,

46:21.040 --> 46:22.880
 for instance, like our respiratory tract,

46:22.880 --> 46:23.880
 we have to breathe,

46:23.880 --> 46:26.640
 we have to get air in from the outside.

46:26.640 --> 46:28.640
 And so that's one of the entries into the body.

46:28.640 --> 46:30.520
 And so, you know, when we inhale,

46:30.520 --> 46:32.360
 let's say a poisonous gas, you know,

46:32.360 --> 46:34.440
 it's an easy way in, you have to breathe,

46:34.440 --> 46:35.880
 can't hold your breath very long,

46:35.880 --> 46:39.800
 but, you know, air in our lungs is still kind of contiguous

46:39.800 --> 46:41.360
 with the external atmosphere,

46:41.360 --> 46:44.440
 it's not really inside the body until it does cross

46:44.440 --> 46:47.400
 across the lining of the alveoli into the blood,

46:47.400 --> 46:49.960
 as you said, that's when it really gets inside.

46:49.960 --> 46:51.460
 And the other besides the respiratory tract,

46:51.460 --> 46:53.940
 the gastrointestinal tract is another way,

46:53.940 --> 46:55.160
 kind of a chink in the armor,

46:55.160 --> 46:57.480
 you know, we have to eat, we have to drink,

46:57.480 --> 46:59.400
 and therefore we're taking the external world

46:59.400 --> 47:01.320
 into ourselves, into our gut,

47:01.320 --> 47:03.120
 in order to extract from it what we need

47:03.120 --> 47:05.340
 and let the rest kind of flow out.

47:05.340 --> 47:08.080
 So those two, the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract,

47:08.080 --> 47:09.440
 you know, there's a reason that, you know,

47:09.440 --> 47:11.280
 respiratory tract infections

47:11.280 --> 47:14.200
 and gastrointestinal infections are kind of the most common

47:14.200 --> 47:17.780
 that afflict us because those are the ways in to the body.

47:17.780 --> 47:20.120
 So I would definitely pick one of those,

47:20.120 --> 47:22.080
 not just be a lazy cold in the nose,

47:22.080 --> 47:24.440
 but really a more aggressive pneumonia down deep

47:24.440 --> 47:27.040
 in the lungs and get across that barrier into the blood.

47:27.040 --> 47:32.040
 But also the whole sex thing that humans do.

47:32.040 --> 47:36.200
 So speaking of which, let us go for time

47:36.200 --> 47:38.440
 to the genitals chapter.

47:38.440 --> 47:41.280
 So what are genitals?

47:41.280 --> 47:43.360
 I think I've heard of those.

47:43.360 --> 47:45.960
 I think I've read about a penis and a vagina.

47:45.960 --> 47:48.920
 Can you explain to me how those work?

47:48.920 --> 47:50.200
 Just asking for a friend,

47:50.200 --> 47:54.200
 but also what do you use fascinating about it

47:54.200 --> 47:58.820
 and maybe what's misunderstood or little known about them?

47:58.820 --> 48:03.420
 Sure, so they're very unique organs, I would say.

48:03.420 --> 48:06.060
 One of the things that I like to point out is that,

48:06.060 --> 48:08.660
 you know, while every organ from moment to moment

48:08.660 --> 48:10.820
 keeps us alive and ensures our survival,

48:10.820 --> 48:12.740
 the genitals are in a way the opposite.

48:12.740 --> 48:15.660
 You know, we don't need them from moment to moment.

48:15.660 --> 48:17.420
 You don't even have to use them at all.

48:17.420 --> 48:20.020
 And in fact, they often make us do stupid things

48:20.020 --> 48:23.100
 that are the opposite of kind of enhancing survival.

48:23.100 --> 48:26.420
 So, and they, you know, they've affected the brain

48:26.420 --> 48:29.140
 and you can become sort of focused and nuts

48:29.140 --> 48:31.940
 based on those desires that kind of stem from the genitals.

48:31.940 --> 48:34.040
 So they can be dangerous organs too.

48:34.920 --> 48:36.860
 But you know, I mean, sexual dimorphism

48:36.860 --> 48:39.540
 helps with genetic variability,

48:39.540 --> 48:41.560
 as it does in so many other organisms.

48:41.560 --> 48:42.780
 You know, you take two people

48:42.780 --> 48:44.320
 and mix them together, their genetics,

48:44.320 --> 48:46.100
 you just get a lot more variation

48:46.100 --> 48:50.460
 and more opportunities to try different genetic codes

48:50.460 --> 48:52.180
 and see what'll enhance survival

48:52.180 --> 48:54.380
 as we talked about sex and death.

48:54.380 --> 48:55.980
 I talk about in the book, a lot of,

48:55.980 --> 48:57.740
 for instance, the female genital tract,

48:57.740 --> 49:00.100
 how the uterus is very unusual

49:00.100 --> 49:02.780
 because, you know, it doesn't even sort of wake up

49:02.780 --> 49:05.540
 and start doing its thing until the second decade of life.

49:05.540 --> 49:08.540
 You know, it's even though babies,

49:09.500 --> 49:12.140
 female babies are born with all of the eggs

49:12.140 --> 49:14.260
 they'll ever have in their ovaries already.

49:14.260 --> 49:15.940
 They're just sort of in this stasis

49:15.940 --> 49:18.980
 until they start waking up kind of once a month.

49:18.980 --> 49:20.480
 And it's this cycle, you know,

49:20.480 --> 49:23.060
 there's so much in our bodies that are cyclical and rhythmic,

49:23.060 --> 49:26.240
 the heartbeat, the breathing, but menstruation

49:26.240 --> 49:28.660
 is kind of a very strange rhythm

49:28.660 --> 49:31.360
 that takes over a decade to start.

49:31.360 --> 49:34.140
 And only, you know, the rhythm beats once a month,

49:34.140 --> 49:35.740
 which is very slow compared

49:35.740 --> 49:37.520
 to every other rhythm of the body.

49:37.520 --> 49:40.380
 The other unusual thing is, you know, in medicine,

49:40.380 --> 49:43.320
 when rhythms of the body cease, when they stop,

49:43.320 --> 49:44.780
 those are emergencies, right?

49:44.780 --> 49:47.060
 When your heart stops, that's a cardiac arrest.

49:47.060 --> 49:50.200
 You need CPR, maybe an electric shock to restart it.

49:50.200 --> 49:51.980
 When your breathing stops, you know,

49:51.980 --> 49:53.740
 you need a breathing machine to breathe for you

49:53.740 --> 49:56.100
 or something to reverse whatever might be causing

49:56.100 --> 49:58.100
 the suppression of your breathing.

49:58.100 --> 49:59.980
 But when menstruation stops,

49:59.980 --> 50:03.500
 it's the point of menstruation in the first place.

50:03.500 --> 50:06.180
 The whole reason that the uterus grows a lining

50:06.180 --> 50:09.380
 and sheds it each month is to one day, you know,

50:09.380 --> 50:11.700
 get fertile, the ovum to get fertilized

50:11.700 --> 50:13.460
 and for it to implant in the lining,

50:13.460 --> 50:14.540
 and then the rhythm ceases.

50:14.540 --> 50:16.620
 And that's obviously not a medical emergency,

50:16.620 --> 50:19.140
 unlike most other rhythms, you know, cessations,

50:19.140 --> 50:21.520
 it's the point of the whole thing in the first place.

50:21.520 --> 50:25.900
 So these particular penis and vagina are that whole thing,

50:25.900 --> 50:26.940
 the uterus, whatever.

50:26.940 --> 50:28.980
 Am I not using the wrong terms?

50:28.980 --> 50:29.820
 I don't know.

50:29.820 --> 50:31.100
 I'll just keep saying.

50:31.100 --> 50:32.220
 You use those terms.

50:32.220 --> 50:35.320
 There's more technical, there's parts, various, various parts.

50:35.320 --> 50:38.020
 In medical school, you learn every bump

50:38.020 --> 50:41.260
 and, you know, every little part of every little organ

50:41.260 --> 50:42.740
 including the genitals, so.

50:43.860 --> 50:47.900
 I never really thought of it this way, as you said,

50:47.900 --> 50:51.500
 is that most organs are kind of full time employees.

50:51.500 --> 50:54.300
 Like 24 seven, they're doing something.

50:54.300 --> 50:56.060
 And then there's some organs,

50:57.540 --> 51:00.940
 penis, vagina being representative of this,

51:00.940 --> 51:03.300
 they're not functioning all the time.

51:03.300 --> 51:05.420
 They're only functioning every once in a while

51:05.420 --> 51:08.540
 and then get us to do stupid stuff or awesome stuff

51:08.540 --> 51:09.580
 and all that kind of stuff.

51:09.580 --> 51:11.740
 But they're not essential for human survival

51:11.740 --> 51:14.260
 on a second by second basis.

51:14.260 --> 51:18.340
 And that the whole cyclical nature of the human body,

51:18.340 --> 51:20.940
 how many other cycles are on a monthly basis?

51:20.940 --> 51:23.420
 Like that far apart.

51:23.420 --> 51:25.860
 That's a fascinating design

51:25.860 --> 51:27.140
 that the human body would do that

51:27.140 --> 51:32.140
 and wouldn't start until the second decade of life.

51:32.500 --> 51:35.780
 It's almost like, what do I want to say?

51:35.780 --> 51:39.980
 There's some kind of meta planning going on.

51:39.980 --> 51:41.940
 Like this is the optimal solution

51:41.940 --> 51:44.460
 for the sexual selection mechanism

51:44.460 --> 51:48.420
 among like somewhat intelligent species.

51:48.420 --> 51:53.380
 Like it's useful to after the brain has developed

51:53.380 --> 51:57.100
 sufficiently long to now be making

51:57.100 --> 51:58.940
 sexual selection decisions.

51:58.940 --> 52:01.540
 Like you need time for this computer,

52:01.540 --> 52:04.320
 this really powerful computer to load in the info.

52:05.780 --> 52:06.620
 Interesting.

52:06.620 --> 52:08.420
 You also need the body to develop.

52:08.420 --> 52:10.780
 A child simply isn't big enough

52:10.780 --> 52:14.400
 to be pregnant and deliver another baby.

52:14.400 --> 52:16.540
 I wonder if there's animals in which this happens

52:16.540 --> 52:19.260
 at a much more accelerated pace in different stages.

52:19.260 --> 52:21.700
 Definitely, especially certain kinds of insects,

52:21.700 --> 52:25.380
 like Drosophila, a lot of the fruit fly,

52:25.380 --> 52:26.660
 a lot of experiments are done on

52:26.660 --> 52:28.780
 because their life cycle is so rapid.

52:28.780 --> 52:31.420
 A lot of kind of insects and other creatures

52:31.420 --> 52:34.580
 are almost ready to mate as soon as they're born.

52:34.580 --> 52:35.640
 Not us.

52:35.640 --> 52:36.660
 Not us.

52:36.660 --> 52:41.660
 Is there any improvements to the design?

52:42.820 --> 52:45.420
 So a lot of people are very interested

52:45.420 --> 52:47.820
 in these particular body parts.

52:47.820 --> 52:49.660
 If you were to sort of step back

52:49.660 --> 52:52.980
 as a geneticist, biological designer,

52:52.980 --> 52:55.500
 or maybe a computer scientist, computer engineer

52:55.500 --> 53:00.500
 trying to build human 2.0 or maybe a robot,

53:00.660 --> 53:04.240
 how would you improve the penis and the vagina?

53:05.380 --> 53:06.780
 Well, the penis for starters,

53:06.780 --> 53:09.460
 I mean, let's also discuss the testicles.

53:09.460 --> 53:10.820
 They're very important too.

53:10.820 --> 53:11.660
 I mean.

53:11.660 --> 53:14.740
 Okay, so they're fragile and they're important

53:14.740 --> 53:18.060
 and yet they're hanging off the body in danger basically.

53:18.060 --> 53:20.260
 So does that make sense?

53:20.260 --> 53:22.000
 You know, they begin in the womb,

53:22.000 --> 53:25.260
 they begin inside the abdomen and they slowly descend

53:25.260 --> 53:26.620
 and sometimes before birth,

53:26.620 --> 53:29.100
 sometimes in the first year of life, sometimes never,

53:29.100 --> 53:32.700
 they pop out of the body and end up hanging in the scrotum.

53:32.700 --> 53:35.060
 There's a reason because the chemical reactions

53:35.060 --> 53:37.700
 that create sperm function best

53:37.700 --> 53:40.860
 at a few degrees cooler than body temperature.

53:40.860 --> 53:44.620
 And so that's why you might notice in the warm weather,

53:44.620 --> 53:47.540
 they might hang further down and in the cold weather,

53:47.540 --> 53:50.340
 they scrunch themselves up to get closer to the body

53:50.340 --> 53:53.500
 to maintain that ideal temperature a few degrees cooler.

53:55.160 --> 53:56.240
 So it's hard, you know,

53:56.240 --> 53:58.280
 if you could create a sperm production mechanism

53:58.280 --> 54:00.100
 that did not rely on that lower temperature,

54:00.100 --> 54:00.940
 that would be great.

54:00.940 --> 54:03.800
 Keep them inside the body protected like the ovaries are.

54:04.940 --> 54:07.140
 Oh, then you wouldn't rely on the lower temperature.

54:07.140 --> 54:10.780
 I thought you meant create some kind of weird internal

54:10.780 --> 54:11.940
 cooling mechanism.

54:11.940 --> 54:14.500
 No, well, I guess that would be one solution,

54:14.500 --> 54:17.580
 but just maybe a different type of chemical reaction

54:17.580 --> 54:19.660
 or, you know, would not be reliant

54:19.660 --> 54:21.860
 on the lower temperature, let's say.

54:21.860 --> 54:25.140
 You know, it'd be great to design a spermatogenesis

54:25.140 --> 54:28.460
 or a sperm production process that would function best

54:28.460 --> 54:30.460
 at body temperature and then we can keep

54:30.460 --> 54:32.540
 those delicate organs inside the body

54:32.540 --> 54:35.180
 and not have them hanging out in danger.

54:35.180 --> 54:37.780
 Or maybe the argument for this design

54:37.780 --> 54:42.380
 is maybe it's nice to put them in danger

54:42.380 --> 54:45.180
 so you are constantly concerned about it.

54:46.100 --> 54:49.100
 Could be, maybe that's beneficial for male psychology,

54:49.100 --> 54:50.140
 I'm not really sure.

54:50.140 --> 54:51.620
 There's a psychological element here

54:51.620 --> 54:53.340
 about the evolution that could be.

54:53.340 --> 54:54.880
 So that's the testicles.

54:56.540 --> 54:57.380
 Penis?

54:58.780 --> 55:00.460
 A better way to do it, you know?

55:00.460 --> 55:03.060
 I mean, it's pretty good as it is.

55:03.060 --> 55:05.740
 You know, it kind of, when it's time for it to work,

55:05.740 --> 55:08.980
 it grows and stiffens and when it's time for it not to work,

55:08.980 --> 55:12.940
 it kind of shrinks and hangs out.

55:12.940 --> 55:17.300
 Saw this on a Seinfeld episode, so I know how it works.

55:17.300 --> 55:18.220
 Shrinkage.

55:18.220 --> 55:19.460
 Yeah, that was a good one.

55:19.460 --> 55:22.980
 But you know, that's also a bit unique,

55:22.980 --> 55:26.580
 I suppose, that the way it has this erectile tissue.

55:26.580 --> 55:29.260
 Actually, they're similar in the mouth

55:29.260 --> 55:32.880
 of certain baleen whales, there's a certain similar

55:32.880 --> 55:37.620
 kind of erectile tissue that helps cool them off

55:37.620 --> 55:39.780
 because they have so much blubber

55:39.780 --> 55:42.660
 and create so much heat in moving around and feeding

55:42.660 --> 55:44.020
 that they have actually a similar,

55:44.020 --> 55:45.700
 similar to the penis organ in their mouth

55:45.700 --> 55:48.140
 that helps cool their bodies, because it's a big problem.

55:48.140 --> 55:51.020
 They have to store all that blubber for fuel,

55:51.020 --> 55:53.140
 but it makes them too hot, so as a compensation,

55:53.140 --> 55:55.320
 they have this kind of erectile organ in their mouth.

55:55.320 --> 55:56.160
 Okay.

55:57.540 --> 55:59.160
 What about vagina?

55:59.160 --> 56:02.900
 You know, the fact that miscarriages sometimes happen

56:02.900 --> 56:05.800
 because of sexually transmitted diseases,

56:05.800 --> 56:08.060
 because of trauma, you know, it'd be great

56:08.060 --> 56:11.340
 if the uterus where the growing fetus is

56:11.340 --> 56:14.020
 is sort of even more protected from those things.

56:15.760 --> 56:18.680
 You know, I guess that's a side effect of the fact

56:18.680 --> 56:20.820
 that people still have sex when they're pregnant

56:20.820 --> 56:23.200
 or still, you know, exposed to injury.

56:23.200 --> 56:25.420
 If there was a way to make it more protected,

56:25.420 --> 56:27.500
 perhaps that would be even better.

56:27.500 --> 56:30.500
 I did see an article recently about artificial wombs,

56:30.500 --> 56:33.740
 which are rapidly becoming a reality,

56:33.740 --> 56:36.540
 and in animal studies, they're able to prolong

56:36.540 --> 56:40.780
 the gestation of a fetus by a month in an artificial womb.

56:40.780 --> 56:42.740
 Can you explain the artificial aspect

56:42.740 --> 56:43.700
 of the artificial womb?

56:43.700 --> 56:46.860
 Sure, it's, I believe it acts almost

56:46.860 --> 56:49.120
 like a heart lung bypass machine,

56:49.120 --> 56:51.980
 so when someone's getting like bypass surgery,

56:51.980 --> 56:54.460
 their heart is stopped, literally they throw ice

56:54.460 --> 56:58.240
 in the chest and they give a potassium infusion

56:58.240 --> 57:01.040
 through the blood, which stops the heart,

57:01.040 --> 57:04.220
 but the blood is run through a machine

57:04.220 --> 57:07.100
 that basically does the work of the heart

57:07.100 --> 57:09.380
 and lungs together, gets oxygen into the blood

57:09.380 --> 57:11.820
 and then pushes it back into the body.

57:11.820 --> 57:14.100
 So I believe it's a sort of similar mechanism

57:14.100 --> 57:16.920
 to keep blood and nutrition flowing to this fetus,

57:18.140 --> 57:20.900
 and so it's just not inside the body of a parent,

57:20.900 --> 57:23.340
 it's in some kind of other device,

57:23.340 --> 57:27.180
 but I think that science is gonna rapidly improve.

57:27.180 --> 57:29.960
 One benefit is, you know, babies are born premature,

57:29.960 --> 57:33.140
 and while, you know, neonatology is able

57:33.140 --> 57:36.140
 to continuously kind of lower the age of viability

57:36.140 --> 57:38.060
 through better technology and understanding

57:38.060 --> 57:40.700
 how, what you can, medicines and other things

57:40.700 --> 57:42.940
 you can do to premature babies when they're born,

57:42.940 --> 57:46.220
 you know, ideally, if let's say premature labor begins,

57:46.220 --> 57:49.260
 you can't stop it, that baby's coming out one way

57:49.260 --> 57:50.860
 or the other, if you could just then stick it

57:50.860 --> 57:52.740
 into an artificial womb where it can continue

57:52.740 --> 57:55.580
 its development, that would save a whole host

57:55.580 --> 57:57.820
 of problems, often those babies born very early

57:57.820 --> 58:00.540
 suffer from damage to various organs,

58:00.540 --> 58:02.580
 including the brain, you know, for the rest of their life,

58:02.580 --> 58:04.980
 so that could be a very important technology.

58:04.980 --> 58:07.760
 So some aspects of the human body,

58:07.760 --> 58:10.380
 we can develop technologies that outsource them,

58:10.380 --> 58:15.380
 sort of offload some of the stress

58:16.140 --> 58:19.780
 and the workload from the human body to do it elsewhere.

58:19.780 --> 58:21.820
 Like dialysis does that for kidneys, you know,

58:21.820 --> 58:25.220
 people can live decades without kidneys

58:25.220 --> 58:29.020
 as long as they get dialysis, which does the work for them.

58:29.020 --> 58:31.180
 Not every organ can do that, for instance,

58:31.180 --> 58:34.180
 the liver, there's no dialysis version for the liver,

58:34.180 --> 58:36.940
 like if your liver fails, you need a liver transplant

58:36.940 --> 58:39.580
 and that's the only thing that's gonna do it for you.

58:40.620 --> 58:45.620
 So that's the world's first artificial womb for humans

58:45.620 --> 58:48.580
 and we're looking at a picture of what looks like

58:48.580 --> 58:50.300
 gigantic balloons.

58:50.300 --> 58:51.900
 Matrix, here we come.

58:51.900 --> 58:53.740
 This is very matrixy.

58:53.740 --> 58:55.420
 How are they floating?

58:55.420 --> 58:57.220
 What are we even looking at?

58:57.220 --> 59:00.340
 There's giant red spheres.

59:00.340 --> 59:02.420
 This really looks like the matrix.

59:03.860 --> 59:04.740
 I wonder where it's from,

59:04.740 --> 59:06.780
 so there seems to be a paper on this too.

59:07.660 --> 59:10.620
 I don't know too much about it, but I did see that there,

59:10.620 --> 59:12.740
 it's advancing very rapidly.

59:12.740 --> 59:14.940
 The world's first artificial womb for humans.

59:14.940 --> 59:18.700
 Scientists in the Netherlands say they're within 10 years

59:18.700 --> 59:20.340
 of developing an artificial womb

59:20.340 --> 59:22.920
 that could save the lives of premature babies.

59:22.920 --> 59:25.420
 Premature birth before 37 weeks is globally

59:25.420 --> 59:27.640
 the biggest cause of death among newborns,

59:27.640 --> 59:31.340
 but the development also raises ethical questions

59:31.340 --> 59:36.260
 about the future of baby making and so on and so forth.

59:36.260 --> 59:40.420
 Wow, we're going to be facing a lot of ethical questions

59:41.380 --> 59:45.780
 as we start to mess with human biology.

59:45.780 --> 59:50.460
 In an effort to help human biology,

59:50.460 --> 59:52.540
 we might start to mess with it.

59:52.540 --> 59:54.540
 That's going to be very interesting.

59:54.540 --> 59:59.280
 Let's take steps towards the matrix.

1:00:01.180 --> 1:00:06.180
 All right, what about the neighbors, poop, feces?

1:00:07.540 --> 1:00:11.660
 There seems to be a lot of interesting stories

1:00:11.660 --> 1:00:14.360
 in that particular output as well.

1:00:16.700 --> 1:00:20.260
 What to you is fascinating?

1:00:20.260 --> 1:00:25.260
 What to you maybe is misunderstood

1:00:26.860 --> 1:00:29.100
 or little known about poop?

1:00:30.580 --> 1:00:33.820
 Well, it's hilarious, for one thing, that we do it.

1:00:35.140 --> 1:00:36.660
 The word is great as well.

1:00:36.660 --> 1:00:38.060
 There's so many different words.

1:00:38.060 --> 1:00:40.600
 I do, when I'm talking to the parents

1:00:40.600 --> 1:00:42.740
 of pediatric patients, I use the word poop.

1:00:42.740 --> 1:00:44.620
 I don't often, when I'm talking to adult patients,

1:00:44.620 --> 1:00:47.140
 try to choose a more mature word.

1:00:47.140 --> 1:00:49.920
 But poop is amazing.

1:00:49.920 --> 1:00:54.920
 I mean, I guess it's sort of the dirtiest, the most vile,

1:00:55.220 --> 1:00:57.900
 the most hated aspect of our bodies.

1:00:57.900 --> 1:01:00.580
 It's the grossest, we don't want to think about it,

1:01:00.580 --> 1:01:04.460
 talk about it, have it anywhere near our food

1:01:04.460 --> 1:01:08.580
 or in social interactions with good reason.

1:01:08.580 --> 1:01:10.180
 I mentioned gastrointestinal infections

1:01:10.180 --> 1:01:11.700
 are one of the most common infections

1:01:11.700 --> 1:01:13.220
 the human body suffers from.

1:01:13.220 --> 1:01:17.520
 And the way they spread from person to person,

1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:20.660
 grossly enough, is referred to as the fecal oral route,

1:01:20.660 --> 1:01:22.840
 which means a bit of someone's stool

1:01:22.840 --> 1:01:25.920
 is getting into your, you're swallowing it,

1:01:25.920 --> 1:01:27.900
 through water supply.

1:01:27.900 --> 1:01:29.940
 For instance, diarrhea is actually quite

1:01:29.940 --> 1:01:32.820
 a brilliant mechanism of these microbes, right?

1:01:32.820 --> 1:01:35.720
 If you, let's say you're in the intestine of one person,

1:01:35.720 --> 1:01:38.900
 your goal is to get into the intestines of another person.

1:01:38.900 --> 1:01:41.620
 Brilliant to just trick their intestines

1:01:41.620 --> 1:01:45.020
 into secreting all this fluid into the intestines

1:01:45.020 --> 1:01:47.780
 to increase the volume of stool and its runniness

1:01:47.780 --> 1:01:50.100
 so that when they do poop, it gets into the water supply

1:01:50.100 --> 1:01:51.380
 and then everyone else kind of ends up

1:01:51.380 --> 1:01:52.780
 getting infected as well.

1:01:52.780 --> 1:01:54.380
 Wow, that's brilliant.

1:01:54.380 --> 1:01:57.920
 Just the same way like tuberculosis or coronavirus

1:01:57.920 --> 1:02:00.140
 kind of infects your lungs and makes you cough

1:02:00.140 --> 1:02:01.380
 and you send it out into the air

1:02:01.380 --> 1:02:02.740
 and it ends up in other people's lungs.

1:02:02.740 --> 1:02:04.580
 And that's all evolution.

1:02:04.580 --> 1:02:06.000
 Yeah, it's brilliant.

1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:11.020
 So diarrhea is intelligent, is a big takeaway lesson.

1:02:11.020 --> 1:02:14.020
 It's one of the most intelligent things we can do

1:02:14.020 --> 1:02:15.980
 as an entirety of an organism,

1:02:15.980 --> 1:02:17.900
 not just the particular cognitive organism,

1:02:17.900 --> 1:02:22.280
 but there's, we're made up of bacteria and viruses

1:02:22.280 --> 1:02:24.320
 and there's a lot of visitors and so on.

1:02:24.320 --> 1:02:25.760
 As the entirety of the system,

1:02:25.760 --> 1:02:28.360
 diarrhea is one of our better accomplishments.

1:02:28.360 --> 1:02:29.280
 It's fascinating.

1:02:30.880 --> 1:02:33.480
 Well, I wonder, why is poop funny?

1:02:34.520 --> 1:02:37.020
 I think a lot of that is socially constructed,

1:02:37.020 --> 1:02:39.420
 just how it's sort of supposed to be hidden away

1:02:39.420 --> 1:02:41.140
 yet something we always do,

1:02:41.140 --> 1:02:43.380
 something we chuckle about as children.

1:02:43.380 --> 1:02:45.020
 But even in healthcare,

1:02:45.020 --> 1:02:48.100
 it becomes this big topic of conversation

1:02:48.100 --> 1:02:50.340
 because you end up talking about it constantly.

1:02:50.340 --> 1:02:52.360
 Like in the ER, people come in,

1:02:53.560 --> 1:02:55.100
 they're complete strangers.

1:02:55.100 --> 1:02:58.700
 Sometimes like a nice old lady who resembles my grandmother

1:02:58.700 --> 1:03:00.600
 and all of a sudden I have to ask her all about

1:03:00.600 --> 1:03:01.980
 what's happening in the bathroom.

1:03:01.980 --> 1:03:03.300
 Like, is she straining?

1:03:03.300 --> 1:03:04.480
 What color is it?

1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:07.840
 What's the consistency?

1:03:07.840 --> 1:03:10.300
 Does it float on top of the water more than it should?

1:03:10.300 --> 1:03:11.200
 Is it hard to flush?

1:03:11.200 --> 1:03:13.340
 I mean, there's a million different questions you learn

1:03:13.340 --> 1:03:17.420
 as a medical student and you're like this poop detective

1:03:17.420 --> 1:03:19.380
 when people come in with issues.

1:03:19.380 --> 1:03:22.300
 And so it's funny, I guess,

1:03:22.300 --> 1:03:25.060
 in the exam room with the doctor patient relationship,

1:03:25.060 --> 1:03:26.620
 there's sort of no barriers.

1:03:26.620 --> 1:03:27.700
 You talk about everything

1:03:27.700 --> 1:03:29.900
 and you're talking about the most intimate details

1:03:29.900 --> 1:03:31.380
 of a person's life,

1:03:31.380 --> 1:03:33.260
 even though you just met them a second ago.

1:03:33.260 --> 1:03:36.820
 It's so different than normal social interactions.

1:03:36.820 --> 1:03:38.940
 Yet there is this social aspect.

1:03:38.940 --> 1:03:40.740
 A lot of what I do is social.

1:03:40.740 --> 1:03:43.900
 It seems like doctors, what they do is mostly scientific,

1:03:43.900 --> 1:03:46.540
 but actually it's just relating to another person

1:03:46.540 --> 1:03:49.860
 and you have to maintain your professional demeanor

1:03:49.860 --> 1:03:51.860
 and this normal human level interaction,

1:03:51.860 --> 1:03:53.820
 even though you're talking about poop.

1:03:54.820 --> 1:03:57.460
 And that's a skill, that's an art and a science.

1:03:57.460 --> 1:03:59.620
 Well, okay, actually I wanna linger on that

1:03:59.620 --> 1:04:03.260
 because I'm a fan of just diving into conversations

1:04:03.260 --> 1:04:08.260
 right away with strangers, just getting no small talk.

1:04:08.260 --> 1:04:12.500
 And this is the ultimate, I don't know if it's the ultimate,

1:04:12.500 --> 1:04:14.460
 but it's one version of no small talk.

1:04:14.460 --> 1:04:16.180
 You get right to the point.

1:04:18.100 --> 1:04:21.260
 That's really powerful from a psychology perspective.

1:04:21.260 --> 1:04:22.460
 You're a kind of therapist

1:04:22.460 --> 1:04:26.260
 or you have the power to be a therapist.

1:04:26.260 --> 1:04:28.700
 I don't mean just about the medical condition of the body,

1:04:28.700 --> 1:04:30.460
 but the psychological.

1:04:30.460 --> 1:04:35.460
 There's so much fear connected to this concern.

1:04:35.460 --> 1:04:40.460
 Also, self doubt, insecurities,

1:04:42.820 --> 1:04:46.300
 even sort of existential thoughts about your mortality,

1:04:46.300 --> 1:04:48.860
 all of those things are right there in the room.

1:04:50.020 --> 1:04:52.500
 So I think one way doctors deal with that

1:04:52.500 --> 1:04:54.940
 is they kind of have this cold way about them.

1:04:54.940 --> 1:04:56.740
 They almost have like dual mode.

1:04:56.740 --> 1:05:00.900
 One is like, I'm going to be friendly on the surface

1:05:00.900 --> 1:05:05.900
 and cold about the brutal honesty of the biology.

1:05:05.980 --> 1:05:10.700
 But I wonder if there's like a skillful middle ground,

1:05:11.900 --> 1:05:15.580
 this dangerous place where you can help people

1:05:15.580 --> 1:05:18.460
 deal with their psychological insecurities,

1:05:18.460 --> 1:05:21.020
 concerns, fears, all those kinds of things.

1:05:21.020 --> 1:05:23.140
 Is that just really tough to do?

1:05:23.140 --> 1:05:25.860
 Yeah, it's a huge part of being a doctor

1:05:25.860 --> 1:05:28.300
 is dealing with the psychological aspects

1:05:28.300 --> 1:05:30.300
 of whatever's going on with the patient's body.

1:05:30.300 --> 1:05:32.980
 I mean, in the ER, you deal with psychiatric emergencies

1:05:32.980 --> 1:05:35.540
 kind of left and right more than ever these days.

1:05:35.540 --> 1:05:37.420
 And that's a huge issue,

1:05:37.420 --> 1:05:41.540
 not to mention sort of drug use, alcohol related stuff,

1:05:41.540 --> 1:05:43.140
 that gets into sort of psychology

1:05:43.140 --> 1:05:45.340
 and the human love of intoxicants

1:05:45.340 --> 1:05:49.740
 and changing the brain's chemistry and habit, of course,

1:05:49.740 --> 1:05:51.940
 we're creatures of habit and that plays in as well.

1:05:51.940 --> 1:05:54.060
 I mean, a big part of, for instance, pediatrics

1:05:54.060 --> 1:05:59.060
 is reassuring parents and kind of convincing them,

1:05:59.060 --> 1:06:01.060
 giving them the confidence that what's going on

1:06:01.060 --> 1:06:03.740
 with their child is not serious, will go away on its own,

1:06:03.740 --> 1:06:06.300
 does not need any particular intervention.

1:06:06.300 --> 1:06:11.300
 And, but adults too, reassurance is a huge part of the game.

1:06:12.980 --> 1:06:17.420
 Yeah, in the ER, you see humanity at its most raw.

1:06:17.420 --> 1:06:20.780
 I feel like you get this tremendous insight into people,

1:06:20.780 --> 1:06:22.260
 how they live, what they worry about,

1:06:22.260 --> 1:06:24.060
 what they think about, how their body works

1:06:24.060 --> 1:06:25.300
 and also how their mind works

1:06:25.300 --> 1:06:28.140
 that you almost don't see anywhere else.

1:06:28.140 --> 1:06:30.940
 It's a really interesting place to work.

1:06:30.940 --> 1:06:32.980
 And also the way our society is shaped,

1:06:32.980 --> 1:06:35.500
 the ER is where people go for almost everything.

1:06:35.500 --> 1:06:37.780
 When they're suicidal, they come to the ER.

1:06:37.780 --> 1:06:40.660
 When they're too high on drugs to walk, they come to the ER.

1:06:40.660 --> 1:06:42.780
 Children who have been abused, sexually abused,

1:06:42.780 --> 1:06:45.900
 physically abused, come to the ER for us to investigate.

1:06:45.900 --> 1:06:48.380
 It's sort of like the all purpose waste bin

1:06:48.380 --> 1:06:51.260
 for the dregs of society, what people do to themselves

1:06:51.260 --> 1:06:53.300
 and what they do to other people.

1:06:53.300 --> 1:06:55.420
 You mentioned you're interested in the darkness of humanity

1:06:55.420 --> 1:06:58.900
 and made me think of the ER where you really see

1:06:58.900 --> 1:07:02.020
 what human life is like in the ER.

1:07:02.020 --> 1:07:04.420
 Okay, you tweet about, you write about,

1:07:04.420 --> 1:07:06.820
 you think about the emergency room ER.

1:07:07.660 --> 1:07:09.100
 That's really fascinating.

1:07:10.100 --> 1:07:13.100
 Just the little window you give to that world

1:07:13.100 --> 1:07:14.140
 is fascinating.

1:07:16.380 --> 1:07:20.540
 What lessons about humanity do you draw

1:07:20.540 --> 1:07:24.380
 from this place where you're so near to death?

1:07:24.380 --> 1:07:26.860
 There's so much chaos.

1:07:26.860 --> 1:07:29.180
 There's so much variety of what's wrong.

1:07:29.180 --> 1:07:34.180
 So little information or the urgent nature

1:07:34.740 --> 1:07:39.380
 of the information inflows such that you can't really reason

1:07:39.380 --> 1:07:41.900
 sort of thoroughly and deeply and collect all the data,

1:07:41.900 --> 1:07:42.900
 all those kinds of things.

1:07:42.900 --> 1:07:45.900
 You have to act fast and then everybody's freaking out.

1:07:45.900 --> 1:07:48.020
 Can you just speak to the human condition

1:07:48.020 --> 1:07:53.020
 that you get a glimpse at through the ER experience?

1:07:55.020 --> 1:07:57.420
 Yeah, I think you do see all those things.

1:07:57.420 --> 1:08:00.340
 I think on one end of the spectrum,

1:08:00.340 --> 1:08:02.100
 it is this very unique place

1:08:02.100 --> 1:08:03.820
 where you get all these unique insights.

1:08:03.820 --> 1:08:07.220
 On the other end, it can become a ho hum workplace

1:08:07.220 --> 1:08:09.660
 just like any other, which is sort of surprising.

1:08:09.660 --> 1:08:11.900
 As I mentioned before, humans seem to be able to get used

1:08:11.900 --> 1:08:15.540
 to almost anything and doctors can get ho hum used to,

1:08:15.540 --> 1:08:18.220
 oh, dying of a heart attack, oh, actively in labor

1:08:18.220 --> 1:08:19.380
 and the baby's half out.

1:08:19.380 --> 1:08:23.620
 Oh, just ho hum, I know what to do, going about my job

1:08:23.620 --> 1:08:26.020
 and go home and have dinner with my family

1:08:26.020 --> 1:08:27.300
 and not think too much about it.

1:08:27.300 --> 1:08:28.580
 That's amazing.

1:08:28.580 --> 1:08:33.220
 I do try to maintain both my fascination.

1:08:33.220 --> 1:08:35.820
 I think writers in general tend to think more

1:08:35.820 --> 1:08:37.620
 about what they see, write more about what they see,

1:08:37.620 --> 1:08:40.620
 maybe draw connections with what they see to other things.

1:08:40.620 --> 1:08:42.380
 So I do think that writer's perspective

1:08:42.380 --> 1:08:45.940
 does help me kind of maintain my fascination

1:08:45.940 --> 1:08:48.780
 and my kind of more of an insightful perspective

1:08:48.780 --> 1:08:51.820
 than just a ho hum, water cooler conversation.

1:08:53.180 --> 1:08:54.460
 But you do see a lot.

1:08:55.940 --> 1:08:58.020
 In a way, medical problems are sort of

1:08:58.020 --> 1:09:00.180
 the great equalizer, right?

1:09:00.180 --> 1:09:03.180
 Class, race, culture, background,

1:09:03.180 --> 1:09:05.940
 the failings of the human body, the way it fails

1:09:05.940 --> 1:09:08.500
 and what we can do to help in those situations

1:09:08.500 --> 1:09:10.340
 is almost universal.

1:09:10.340 --> 1:09:13.140
 I always like this quote from, Chekhov was a doctor

1:09:13.140 --> 1:09:18.140
 and a writer and he treated a lot of peasants

1:09:18.260 --> 1:09:20.860
 very low class and also treated a lot of aristocrats.

1:09:20.860 --> 1:09:24.260
 And he wrote that they all have the same ugly bodies

1:09:24.260 --> 1:09:27.380
 basically, which I think is really right on.

1:09:27.380 --> 1:09:29.940
 And it's sort of, you can see people

1:09:29.940 --> 1:09:32.340
 underneath a superficial layer of clothing,

1:09:32.340 --> 1:09:34.100
 maybe it's the most expensive clothing

1:09:34.100 --> 1:09:35.700
 bought from the fanciest places,

1:09:35.700 --> 1:09:38.460
 but underneath their body is still failing in the same way

1:09:38.460 --> 1:09:40.660
 and they still have the same anxieties, the same worry

1:09:40.660 --> 1:09:43.460
 about mortality, the same concerns about why their poop

1:09:43.460 --> 1:09:46.260
 turned green today, all these things

1:09:46.260 --> 1:09:47.380
 that they bring to the table.

1:09:47.380 --> 1:09:49.980
 So in a way, it is this great equalizer

1:09:49.980 --> 1:09:52.540
 where people are kind of all the same in some ways.

1:09:53.580 --> 1:09:58.580
 Yeah, I feel like people sometimes, class, money,

1:09:58.660 --> 1:10:02.900
 fame, power, makes you for a time forget

1:10:02.900 --> 1:10:06.300
 that you're just a meat vehicle.

1:10:06.300 --> 1:10:09.780
 And just as good and just as bad

1:10:09.780 --> 1:10:13.220
 as the other meat vehicles all around you.

1:10:14.100 --> 1:10:18.180
 In that sense, there's this question sometimes raised,

1:10:18.180 --> 1:10:20.300
 are some people better than others?

1:10:20.300 --> 1:10:24.740
 And I usually answer no to that question because of that.

1:10:24.740 --> 1:10:26.620
 Yeah, some people might be better at math,

1:10:26.620 --> 1:10:29.540
 some people might be better at music.

1:10:29.540 --> 1:10:31.760
 But in the end, we're just meat bags.

1:10:33.300 --> 1:10:35.020
 Beautiful as we are.

1:10:35.020 --> 1:10:39.820
 There's a poem that just, a small tangent I want to take,

1:10:39.820 --> 1:10:44.820
 I just saw it, Just Acting, that you have written.

1:10:47.140 --> 1:10:49.980
 I have to, would you classify it as a poem?

1:10:49.980 --> 1:10:50.940
 Yeah.

1:10:50.940 --> 1:10:54.740
 At first, if I may read it, at first you enter the clinic,

1:10:54.740 --> 1:10:57.500
 shoulders weighed down by white coat pockets,

1:10:57.500 --> 1:11:01.780
 book stuffed, timid, you act out a role,

1:11:01.780 --> 1:11:05.660
 your white coat, a costume, your questions, a script,

1:11:05.660 --> 1:11:08.380
 your demeanor, a rehearsed act.

1:11:08.380 --> 1:11:10.540
 No one is going to buy this.

1:11:10.540 --> 1:11:13.860
 But then, as you play the role again and again,

1:11:13.860 --> 1:11:16.300
 repeating the lines and the motions,

1:11:16.300 --> 1:11:17.980
 the script slowly dissolves

1:11:17.980 --> 1:11:20.900
 and the interaction becomes thoughtless.

1:11:20.900 --> 1:11:24.300
 And the rehearsed act slowly fades into a profession.

1:11:24.300 --> 1:11:26.980
 You suddenly find yourself unable to tell

1:11:26.980 --> 1:11:31.140
 if you're still acting or if you're doing it for real.

1:11:31.140 --> 1:11:33.620
 And now you're a doctor.

1:11:33.620 --> 1:11:36.260
 Jonathan Reisman, MD, Harvard,

1:11:36.260 --> 1:11:38.060
 Massachusetts General Hospital of Medicine

1:11:38.060 --> 1:11:39.980
 and Pediatrics Department.

1:11:39.980 --> 1:11:44.140
 Beautiful, so that is what it is to be a doctor.

1:11:44.140 --> 1:11:45.420
 You're just acting.

1:11:45.420 --> 1:11:46.460
 Fake it till you make it.

1:11:46.460 --> 1:11:48.140
 Exactly, fake it till you make it.

1:11:48.140 --> 1:11:50.420
 And I think, I imagine every medical student

1:11:50.420 --> 1:11:53.020
 has this feeling when they first go into a room.

1:11:53.020 --> 1:11:56.100
 Like I talked about asking this nice old lady

1:11:56.100 --> 1:11:58.420
 about the color of her poop for the first time

1:11:58.420 --> 1:12:00.300
 and you're just like, what am I doing here?

1:12:00.300 --> 1:12:02.660
 Like, does she believe I'm a doctor?

1:12:02.660 --> 1:12:04.580
 You know, this just feels absurd.

1:12:04.580 --> 1:12:07.800
 But then it's, again, ho hum, becomes normal.

1:12:09.140 --> 1:12:12.740
 Now there's not a sperm chapter in your book.

1:12:14.580 --> 1:12:17.940
 You mentioned offline that this is a second and a third book

1:12:17.940 --> 1:12:19.660
 that you're working on all about sperm.

1:12:19.660 --> 1:12:21.320
 No, I'm just kidding.

1:12:21.320 --> 1:12:22.720
 But, or maybe I'm not.

1:12:24.020 --> 1:12:26.940
 Humor tends to make way for reality.

1:12:26.940 --> 1:12:31.940
 So the tweet was that a human, an average human male

1:12:32.600 --> 1:12:36.120
 produces 500 billion sperm, I believe,

1:12:36.120 --> 1:12:39.340
 which is about four to five times more

1:12:39.340 --> 1:12:42.840
 than the number of people who have ever lived.

1:12:42.840 --> 1:12:45.740
 And each of those sperm is genetically unique

1:12:45.740 --> 1:12:48.680
 so you can think of them, you can kind of imagine

1:12:48.680 --> 1:12:51.040
 the possible humans they could have created.

1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:53.140
 And they're all different.

1:12:53.140 --> 1:12:54.600
 They have similarities, of course,

1:12:54.600 --> 1:12:57.720
 but they have peculiarities that make them different.

1:12:57.720 --> 1:12:59.500
 And you can think of all the different trajectories,

1:12:59.500 --> 1:13:02.580
 all the Einsteins, the Feynmans, the Hitlers,

1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:08.200
 and all the people who would have died during childbirth,

1:13:08.200 --> 1:13:09.960
 would have died early in their years

1:13:09.960 --> 1:13:11.320
 given the different diseases.

1:13:11.320 --> 1:13:13.280
 It's fascinating to think about.

1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:17.080
 An average human, yeah, we're all winners

1:13:17.080 --> 1:13:19.080
 of a very competitive race.

1:13:19.080 --> 1:13:23.880
 So the people who make it, we're winners, hashtag winning.

1:13:23.880 --> 1:13:28.880
 Is there something that you find fascinating,

1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:35.600
 interesting, beautiful, ugly, surprising about sperm?

1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:43.240
 I think sperm is, yes, it is a very interesting bodily fluid.

1:13:43.240 --> 1:13:45.400
 Maybe I'll write about it in a second or third book,

1:13:45.400 --> 1:13:49.000
 we'll see, but I guess sperm is interesting

1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:53.440
 because it's kind of the only projectile bodily fluid

1:13:53.440 --> 1:13:54.540
 from the body.

1:13:56.160 --> 1:13:57.600
 Vomit can be projectile.

1:13:57.600 --> 1:13:59.000
 Usually that's a diseased state.

1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.400
 That's not the expected kind of normal healthy state.

1:14:01.400 --> 1:14:03.840
 Oh, sneezing, would you classify that or no?

1:14:03.840 --> 1:14:06.920
 True, I guess it's, yeah, there's some particles in the air.

1:14:06.920 --> 1:14:11.760
 I guess it's not a fluid, I mean, not a liquid, but true.

1:14:11.760 --> 1:14:13.840
 I mean, cough, in addition to sneeze, right?

1:14:13.840 --> 1:14:16.200
 Sneeze is how our nose gets rid of something

1:14:16.200 --> 1:14:17.040
 that shouldn't be there.

1:14:17.040 --> 1:14:18.480
 Cough is how our lungs get rid of something

1:14:18.480 --> 1:14:19.400
 that shouldn't be there.

1:14:19.400 --> 1:14:20.880
 Vomiting is sometimes how our stomachs

1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:22.900
 get rid of something that shouldn't be there.

1:14:22.900 --> 1:14:25.440
 All projectiles sometimes in their own way.

1:14:25.440 --> 1:14:26.680
 Sperm is sort of interesting.

1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:28.920
 It's created with the food for its journey.

1:14:28.920 --> 1:14:31.620
 Sperm mostly feed off of fructose, a kind of sugar,

1:14:32.680 --> 1:14:34.120
 for the few days that they live inside

1:14:34.120 --> 1:14:35.840
 the female genital tract.

1:14:35.840 --> 1:14:38.160
 But it's sort of, I like comparing our genitals

1:14:38.160 --> 1:14:40.520
 to the genitals of the plant world, which is flowers,

1:14:40.520 --> 1:14:44.600
 and in the same way that a touch me not, for instance,

1:14:44.600 --> 1:14:46.720
 the kind of flower where when you brush up against it,

1:14:46.720 --> 1:14:48.940
 it sort of launches seeds into the distance

1:14:48.940 --> 1:14:53.640
 to try to survive in a way kind of the sperm

1:14:53.640 --> 1:14:54.740
 is doing something similar,

1:14:54.740 --> 1:14:56.680
 launched into the female genital tract,

1:14:56.680 --> 1:14:58.980
 and then all trying to find this,

1:14:58.980 --> 1:15:01.600
 competing against each other to find this egg.

1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:02.440
 It's really amazing.

1:15:02.440 --> 1:15:05.160
 And when you learn about it from the biological perspective,

1:15:05.160 --> 1:15:09.440
 the most amazing thing is how many things can go wrong,

1:15:09.440 --> 1:15:11.880
 just in the sperm not surviving long enough

1:15:11.880 --> 1:15:13.600
 for it making it to the egg,

1:15:13.600 --> 1:15:17.720
 and then some genetic abnormality causing a miscarriage.

1:15:17.720 --> 1:15:21.280
 It's sort of astounding that it works as often as it does,

1:15:21.280 --> 1:15:23.360
 and I think the lesson there is just that

1:15:23.360 --> 1:15:26.520
 people have a lot of sex, and so statistics just favor

1:15:26.520 --> 1:15:29.280
 it's gonna work out a good number of times.

1:15:29.280 --> 1:15:31.720
 Yeah, and there might be intelligence in the design

1:15:31.720 --> 1:15:33.940
 of just the sheer number of sperm.

1:15:33.940 --> 1:15:35.480
 Maybe that's yet another way

1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:38.640
 to inject variety into the system.

1:15:38.640 --> 1:15:40.320
 And redundancy, I guess.

1:15:40.320 --> 1:15:42.680
 We have two kidneys, we have two hands.

1:15:42.680 --> 1:15:44.560
 If we lose one, we can still go on.

1:15:44.560 --> 1:15:47.880
 We have however many millions of sperm

1:15:47.880 --> 1:15:50.160
 get sort of launched in every ejaculation

1:15:50.160 --> 1:15:54.360
 is if a bunch fail or don't make it inside.

1:15:54.360 --> 1:15:56.200
 There's papers on this, by the way,

1:15:56.200 --> 1:15:57.780
 that I read for some reason.

1:15:57.780 --> 1:16:00.300
 Not read, but skimmed for some reason,

1:16:00.300 --> 1:16:04.400
 which is talking about which sperm usually wins.

1:16:04.400 --> 1:16:06.160
 Like what are the characteristics of sperms

1:16:06.160 --> 1:16:09.280
 that are winning, and it's not the fastest.

1:16:09.280 --> 1:16:13.400
 So apparently there's some kind of slaughter

1:16:13.400 --> 1:16:15.340
 that happens early on, people will correct me,

1:16:15.340 --> 1:16:17.260
 but it's not the fastest.

1:16:17.260 --> 1:16:19.360
 There is an aspect of it's the luckiest.

1:16:19.360 --> 1:16:21.360
 It really is, like the body tries

1:16:21.360 --> 1:16:23.400
 to make it a random selection.

1:16:23.400 --> 1:16:27.920
 It tries to make it fair in making it as random as possible.

1:16:27.920 --> 1:16:29.520
 Interesting, and also interesting

1:16:29.520 --> 1:16:30.760
 that they're fueled by fructose.

1:16:30.760 --> 1:16:32.320
 I didn't really think about that.

1:16:32.320 --> 1:16:37.280
 So they're a carb loaded athlete.

1:16:37.280 --> 1:16:38.860
 Right, with food for the journey.

1:16:38.860 --> 1:16:40.520
 Food for the journey, because I'm somebody

1:16:40.520 --> 1:16:43.640
 that actually does a lot of running on,

1:16:43.640 --> 1:16:46.400
 I guess you would call me a fat adapted athlete.

1:16:46.400 --> 1:16:51.200
 So I do sort of meat heavy diet.

1:16:51.200 --> 1:16:53.860
 And so you could do a lot of endurance kind of stuff

1:16:53.860 --> 1:16:56.500
 when you don't need any carbs, any glucose,

1:16:56.500 --> 1:16:58.000
 any of that kind of stuff.

1:16:58.000 --> 1:16:59.960
 And you're very low.

1:16:59.960 --> 1:17:01.900
 It's interesting to think that sperm are like,

1:17:01.900 --> 1:17:04.120
 nope, they're total bros.

1:17:04.120 --> 1:17:08.480
 Let's go to the gym, sprint, performance,

1:17:08.480 --> 1:17:11.360
 short term performance is everything.

1:17:11.360 --> 1:17:16.360
 All right, well, that sperm, returning to the liver,

1:17:16.400 --> 1:17:20.440
 the place that deals with all our poor decisions.

1:17:20.440 --> 1:17:21.840
 No.

1:17:21.840 --> 1:17:22.680
 Many of them.

1:17:22.680 --> 1:17:24.060
 Many of our poor decisions.

1:17:24.060 --> 1:17:29.060
 Is there, you said that the liver does quite a few things.

1:17:30.380 --> 1:17:33.000
 What to you is fascinating, beautiful about the liver?

1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:35.880
 I'd say it's primary function seems to be

1:17:35.880 --> 1:17:40.240
 as the sort of gatekeeper for what we eat and absorb.

1:17:40.240 --> 1:17:42.920
 You know, the entire gastrointestinal tract

1:17:42.920 --> 1:17:45.840
 from the esophagus to the rectum,

1:17:45.840 --> 1:17:48.720
 the blood flows from it, not back to the heart,

1:17:48.720 --> 1:17:51.920
 but to the liver where it's first examined,

1:17:51.920 --> 1:17:55.680
 kind of things are evaluated, packaged,

1:17:55.680 --> 1:17:59.480
 you know, processed, detoxified, perhaps.

1:17:59.480 --> 1:18:01.180
 It's kind of this great overseer

1:18:01.180 --> 1:18:03.880
 of what we digest and absorb.

1:18:03.880 --> 1:18:07.680
 And so it kind of keeps track of what's coming in,

1:18:07.680 --> 1:18:09.640
 you know, the outside world that comes in

1:18:09.640 --> 1:18:11.860
 and will become part of us.

1:18:11.860 --> 1:18:14.600
 You know, that's why partly the liver suffers

1:18:14.600 --> 1:18:19.240
 sometimes the injury from certain toxins like alcohol.

1:18:19.240 --> 1:18:21.720
 But beyond that, the liver is also the place,

1:18:21.720 --> 1:18:23.760
 as I said, it metabolizes things too.

1:18:23.760 --> 1:18:25.680
 So it metabolizes alcohol

1:18:25.680 --> 1:18:27.360
 and why it can be injured by alcohol.

1:18:27.360 --> 1:18:29.320
 It metabolizes drugs like Tylenol,

1:18:29.320 --> 1:18:33.640
 which is why Tylenol can be very toxic to the liver

1:18:33.640 --> 1:18:35.080
 when taken as an overdose.

1:18:36.480 --> 1:18:38.520
 So the liver, you know, even beyond that,

1:18:38.520 --> 1:18:42.080
 the liver produces a lot of different, you know,

1:18:42.080 --> 1:18:43.540
 things that float in the bloodstream.

1:18:43.540 --> 1:18:46.240
 It packages cholesterol and fats

1:18:46.240 --> 1:18:48.080
 and sends them to where they're needed.

1:18:48.080 --> 1:18:50.080
 It deals with protein in the blood.

1:18:50.080 --> 1:18:51.880
 It deals with clotting factors in the blood,

1:18:51.880 --> 1:18:54.960
 helping the blood clot, you know,

1:18:54.960 --> 1:18:57.360
 processes things like bilirubin and other things

1:18:57.360 --> 1:18:58.440
 that really, as I mentioned,

1:18:58.440 --> 1:19:00.440
 is like 15 organs wrapped into one.

1:19:00.440 --> 1:19:02.840
 Maybe that's why it's sort of the biggest internal organ.

1:19:02.840 --> 1:19:06.280
 The skin's bigger, but it's not an internal organ.

1:19:06.280 --> 1:19:10.320
 Right, the biggest organ in the human body is the skin.

1:19:10.320 --> 1:19:13.060
 Right, but the liver's the biggest internal organ

1:19:13.060 --> 1:19:15.960
 and it really is a powerhouse and does a lot,

1:19:15.960 --> 1:19:18.600
 which is why when people suffer from liver failure,

1:19:18.600 --> 1:19:20.560
 kind of everything goes wrong in a way.

1:19:21.440 --> 1:19:24.020
 And in terms of replacing organs,

1:19:24.020 --> 1:19:28.320
 what are organs that are easily replaceable,

1:19:28.320 --> 1:19:29.840
 which are not?

1:19:29.840 --> 1:19:31.800
 Like on the list of things that are hard to replace

1:19:31.800 --> 1:19:34.800
 and not, what would you put in number one?

1:19:34.800 --> 1:19:37.200
 What would you put like at the bottom?

1:19:37.200 --> 1:19:39.600
 Well, I'd say the kidneys are, you know, nothing's easy,

1:19:39.600 --> 1:19:41.840
 but kidneys are easiest in a way.

1:19:41.840 --> 1:19:44.040
 Partly, I mean, maybe a big factor there

1:19:44.040 --> 1:19:45.520
 is that other people have two of them

1:19:45.520 --> 1:19:46.480
 and can give one to you.

1:19:46.480 --> 1:19:47.980
 So you don't have to wait for people to die,

1:19:47.980 --> 1:19:50.000
 which is the case with hearts and livers.

1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:52.000
 Sometimes you can take a part of a liver

1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:53.400
 from someone who's alive

1:19:53.400 --> 1:19:57.100
 and the liver does have this kind of mythological ability

1:19:57.100 --> 1:19:59.240
 to regenerate itself.

1:19:59.240 --> 1:20:03.080
 In the myth of Prometheus, he's chained to a rock

1:20:03.080 --> 1:20:04.880
 and the bird eats his liver every day

1:20:04.880 --> 1:20:06.880
 and it grows back every day.

1:20:06.880 --> 1:20:10.160
 And that's actually biologically accurate.

1:20:10.160 --> 1:20:11.760
 Not that you can completely get rid of it

1:20:11.760 --> 1:20:12.640
 and it'll appear again,

1:20:12.640 --> 1:20:15.100
 but when pieces of it are removed or injured,

1:20:15.100 --> 1:20:17.300
 it does regenerate itself pretty amazingly.

1:20:19.240 --> 1:20:20.160
 So I'd say the kidneys,

1:20:20.160 --> 1:20:21.960
 the fact that there are more around,

1:20:21.960 --> 1:20:24.200
 also it's, you know, the kidney is a smaller organ.

1:20:24.200 --> 1:20:27.320
 It's often just, you don't have to put a transplanted kidney

1:20:27.320 --> 1:20:29.360
 where the kidney should be in the back of the abdomen.

1:20:29.360 --> 1:20:31.680
 You can just kind of stuff it into the pelvis there

1:20:31.680 --> 1:20:32.760
 because it's a smaller organ.

1:20:32.760 --> 1:20:34.860
 The liver would be hard because it's huge.

1:20:36.200 --> 1:20:38.120
 And I guess we just have the most experience

1:20:38.120 --> 1:20:41.920
 with kidney transplants because they are the most common.

1:20:41.920 --> 1:20:46.440
 And the heart and the brain are probably quite difficult.

1:20:46.440 --> 1:20:49.500
 Brain, as far as I know, hasn't been successfully done.

1:20:49.500 --> 1:20:51.080
 The heart is done.

1:20:52.120 --> 1:20:55.360
 And definitely I've evaluated a lot of patients

1:20:55.360 --> 1:20:56.920
 with a heart transplant.

1:20:56.920 --> 1:20:58.200
 It does work pretty well.

1:20:58.200 --> 1:21:00.520
 The mechanical heart substitutes

1:21:00.520 --> 1:21:03.660
 are also advancing quite rapidly these days.

1:21:03.660 --> 1:21:04.720
 For a failing heart,

1:21:04.720 --> 1:21:06.240
 there are certain kinds of devices

1:21:06.240 --> 1:21:08.320
 they can surgically implant.

1:21:08.320 --> 1:21:10.960
 Like when a failing heart isn't able to push hard enough,

1:21:10.960 --> 1:21:13.120
 you know, that's the heart's job is pushing blood

1:21:13.120 --> 1:21:15.600
 with sufficient pressure to create blood pressure.

1:21:15.600 --> 1:21:17.820
 When it fails, there are actually these devices

1:21:17.820 --> 1:21:21.500
 you can strap onto the heart to help it pump harder.

1:21:21.500 --> 1:21:23.180
 Those are rapidly advancing.

1:21:23.180 --> 1:21:25.320
 Many of those were not available even 10 years ago

1:21:25.320 --> 1:21:29.280
 when I got out of med school and now they're commonly used.

1:21:29.280 --> 1:21:31.200
 So maybe heart transplant won't be as necessary

1:21:31.200 --> 1:21:34.480
 in the future if those mechanical things do advance.

1:21:34.480 --> 1:21:37.160
 And as I said, the heart is basically a mechanical pump.

1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:39.200
 So perhaps it would be the easiest organ

1:21:39.200 --> 1:21:41.880
 to replace with some mechanical device.

1:21:41.880 --> 1:21:43.600
 Now for something completely different,

1:21:43.600 --> 1:21:45.040
 returning to testicles for a time.

1:21:45.040 --> 1:21:50.040
 You posted a Instagram post of testicles as food.

1:21:51.520 --> 1:21:54.260
 Perhaps eating them doesn't help libido

1:21:54.260 --> 1:21:58.200
 because ingested testosterone is totally metabolized

1:21:58.200 --> 1:22:01.160
 in the liver, returning to our liver,

1:22:01.160 --> 1:22:03.440
 leaving none to reach the bloodstream.

1:22:03.440 --> 1:22:06.440
 That is why testosterone only comes as injection

1:22:06.440 --> 1:22:10.360
 or topical foam, not as pills.

1:22:10.360 --> 1:22:14.180
 On the other hand, estrogen and progesterone

1:22:14.180 --> 1:22:17.360
 can be absorbed orally, hence the pill.

1:22:17.360 --> 1:22:19.760
 But testosterone is mostly responsible

1:22:19.760 --> 1:22:21.420
 for libido in women too.

1:22:21.420 --> 1:22:23.640
 I was not expecting for this biology lesson

1:22:23.640 --> 1:22:28.440
 when I was looking at an Instagram picture of,

1:22:28.440 --> 1:22:30.000
 are we looking at testicles?

1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:30.840
 Yeah.

1:22:30.840 --> 1:22:34.160
 Are these like, which species?

1:22:34.160 --> 1:22:36.360
 I believe all those are from cows.

1:22:36.360 --> 1:22:37.560
 From cows, cow testicles.

1:22:37.560 --> 1:22:39.880
 Cows are technically female, so bulls.

1:22:39.880 --> 1:22:43.760
 Yeah, well, speaking of which, just we'll jump around a bit,

1:22:43.760 --> 1:22:47.720
 but you've also traveled the world quite a bit.

1:22:47.720 --> 1:22:52.720
 What is the craziest food you've eaten across the world?

1:22:56.280 --> 1:22:58.800
 What have you learned about the extremes

1:22:58.800 --> 1:23:02.800
 of the culinary arts by traveling the world?

1:23:03.720 --> 1:23:07.720
 I would say, I guess I've always been extra fascinated

1:23:07.720 --> 1:23:11.600
 with the diets of natives of the far north.

1:23:11.600 --> 1:23:15.300
 I spent some time there in Russia and in Alaska

1:23:15.300 --> 1:23:18.440
 and always loved their diet.

1:23:18.440 --> 1:23:21.520
 So when I worked in Alaska in emergency room

1:23:21.520 --> 1:23:24.040
 and did some other travels in Arctic Alaska,

1:23:24.040 --> 1:23:27.760
 and they eat a lot of fat.

1:23:27.760 --> 1:23:29.940
 Traditionally before contact,

1:23:29.940 --> 1:23:33.000
 more than half of all calories in the Inupiat Eskimo diet

1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:36.120
 came from blubber, marine mammal fat,

1:23:36.120 --> 1:23:38.600
 or also fat from fish, fat from ducks

1:23:38.600 --> 1:23:41.640
 and other birds that go up there to mate in the summer.

1:23:41.640 --> 1:23:43.440
 So things like raw whale blubber

1:23:43.440 --> 1:23:48.120
 was especially interesting for me and very exciting.

1:23:48.120 --> 1:23:52.240
 You know, I had some beluga whale chowder, things like that.

1:23:52.240 --> 1:23:55.900
 There's just all these very unusual dishes.

1:23:55.900 --> 1:23:58.720
 You know, there's a dish called Mikiyak,

1:23:58.720 --> 1:24:03.340
 which is whale meat fermented in whale blood,

1:24:03.340 --> 1:24:05.000
 which is quite delicious actually.

1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:08.320
 So is it cooked, is it eaten raw?

1:24:08.320 --> 1:24:09.520
 How do they like their fat?

1:24:09.520 --> 1:24:14.520
 Like in the same way up north in Russia, as you mentioned.

1:24:14.760 --> 1:24:16.760
 So they often eat it raw.

1:24:16.760 --> 1:24:19.100
 So the raw whale blubber is called Muktuk

1:24:20.140 --> 1:24:22.040
 and it's often just sliced thin

1:24:22.040 --> 1:24:25.560
 and it's sort of cold, but not frozen often when they eat it

1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:26.820
 and they slice it thin.

1:24:26.820 --> 1:24:30.100
 And a lot of people assume it would be very chewy,

1:24:30.100 --> 1:24:31.360
 but it's not that chewy.

1:24:31.360 --> 1:24:32.480
 It's quite pleasant actually

1:24:32.480 --> 1:24:36.280
 and has this kind of sea smell to it as you're eating it.

1:24:36.280 --> 1:24:37.180
 I quite like it.

1:24:37.180 --> 1:24:40.340
 And what's the culinary culture like?

1:24:41.480 --> 1:24:45.680
 Meaning, is it just source of energy or is it art?

1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:47.520
 Well, there's, you know, traditionally,

1:24:47.520 --> 1:24:51.600
 there's not a lot of cooking in the Arctic.

1:24:51.600 --> 1:24:53.160
 A lot of things are eaten raw,

1:24:53.160 --> 1:24:56.720
 partly because there's not a lot of fuel for making fires.

1:24:56.720 --> 1:24:58.160
 So they will, you know,

1:24:58.160 --> 1:25:01.240
 some of the big rivers in Russia, for instance,

1:25:01.240 --> 1:25:03.700
 that flow north, they will bring trees,

1:25:03.700 --> 1:25:05.800
 you know, dead trees and logs up to the north

1:25:05.800 --> 1:25:07.680
 and they can get some wood that way.

1:25:07.680 --> 1:25:09.580
 And same thing in some of the rivers

1:25:09.580 --> 1:25:12.860
 kind of flowing northward from the Brooks Range of Alaska.

1:25:12.860 --> 1:25:14.020
 You do get some trees,

1:25:14.020 --> 1:25:18.200
 but just not enough to really produce a culinary art

1:25:18.200 --> 1:25:20.740
 that requires cooking with heat.

1:25:20.740 --> 1:25:24.000
 You know, they do have traditionally blubber lamps

1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:26.320
 where the blubbers of seals and whales are used

1:25:26.320 --> 1:25:28.280
 to create a little flame.

1:25:28.280 --> 1:25:31.440
 Often that's for light and for a little bit of heat

1:25:32.280 --> 1:25:34.580
 and less for cooking.

1:25:34.580 --> 1:25:37.200
 But eating things raw is definitely a huge part

1:25:37.200 --> 1:25:38.040
 of the culture there.

1:25:38.040 --> 1:25:40.220
 And while I was, I went on a whale hunting trip

1:25:40.220 --> 1:25:44.720
 out on the spring ice in the Arctic Ocean by Barrow, Alaska.

1:25:44.720 --> 1:25:48.840
 And two of the guys, the Inupiat guys who had invited me

1:25:48.840 --> 1:25:51.480
 were kind of talking about how eating things raw

1:25:51.480 --> 1:25:53.480
 is sort of the most essential characteristic

1:25:53.480 --> 1:25:54.880
 of Inupiat culture.

1:25:54.880 --> 1:25:56.920
 And the one guy who's half white, half Inupiat,

1:25:56.920 --> 1:25:59.160
 said people often doubt his ethnicity

1:25:59.160 --> 1:26:00.680
 because he looks like a white guy.

1:26:00.680 --> 1:26:04.360
 So he'll, you know, bite the head off of a raw bird

1:26:04.360 --> 1:26:07.320
 to show them that he is truly Inupiat, is what he said.

1:26:07.320 --> 1:26:09.080
 That's how you prove you're legit.

1:26:09.080 --> 1:26:11.080
 We're looking at an Instagram pic.

1:26:11.080 --> 1:26:14.060
 As a doctor, I was used to knowing fat

1:26:14.060 --> 1:26:17.120
 as the most maligned of all body parts

1:26:17.120 --> 1:26:19.520
 and the culprit in an obesity epidemic.

1:26:19.520 --> 1:26:23.000
 But in Arctic Alaska, fat has always meant

1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:24.720
 health and survival.

1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:27.280
 In fact, the entire story of life in the Arctic,

1:26:27.280 --> 1:26:30.720
 especially human life, is basically a tale of fat.

1:26:30.720 --> 1:26:33.560
 And in Barrow, what's A.K.?

1:26:33.560 --> 1:26:34.400
 Alaska.

1:26:34.400 --> 1:26:35.360
 Alaska, okay.

1:26:36.320 --> 1:26:39.160
 A lawn covered with a whale blubber

1:26:39.160 --> 1:26:42.440
 is still equivalent of a plush green lawn

1:26:42.440 --> 1:26:46.980
 in temperature suburbia, swelling in its owner with pride.

1:26:46.980 --> 1:26:48.120
 And that's what we're looking at,

1:26:48.120 --> 1:26:51.780
 is a lawn full of whale blubber.

1:26:53.520 --> 1:26:55.000
 A beautiful, and this, so this is,

1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:56.800
 I mean, there's a lot of calories there.

1:26:56.800 --> 1:26:57.640
 Oh, yeah.

1:26:57.640 --> 1:26:58.880
 And this can feed a lot of people.

1:26:58.880 --> 1:27:01.220
 A lot of energy, a lot of warmth.

1:27:01.220 --> 1:27:03.280
 Absolutely, and it's delicious.

1:27:03.280 --> 1:27:06.960
 This was like, I was a kid in a candy store, basically.

1:27:06.960 --> 1:27:08.480
 I rounded a corner in Barrow.

1:27:08.480 --> 1:27:10.120
 So when people do get a whale

1:27:10.120 --> 1:27:12.120
 during the spring whaling season,

1:27:12.120 --> 1:27:14.020
 they raise a flag or the whaling captain

1:27:14.020 --> 1:27:15.520
 raises a flag over his house

1:27:15.520 --> 1:27:18.680
 and everyone in town is welcome to come try some.

1:27:18.680 --> 1:27:21.600
 And so before I went inside to try some,

1:27:21.600 --> 1:27:23.960
 I was kinda playing around with blubber

1:27:23.960 --> 1:27:26.320
 and I saw the, this is a bowhead whale.

1:27:26.320 --> 1:27:29.260
 I saw its heart, which was huge,

1:27:29.260 --> 1:27:31.560
 like the size of a yoga ball.

1:27:31.560 --> 1:27:33.800
 And that was, for me, just like amazing.

1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:35.560
 I spent probably the next 45 minutes

1:27:35.560 --> 1:27:37.080
 just looking at all aspects of it.

1:27:37.080 --> 1:27:39.640
 And the stump of aorta that was attached to it

1:27:39.640 --> 1:27:41.880
 was the size of my thigh.

1:27:41.880 --> 1:27:43.660
 That was really fascinating.

1:27:43.660 --> 1:27:46.080
 It's similar Alaska and Northern Russia,

1:27:46.080 --> 1:27:48.160
 like Siberia and out there.

1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:49.480
 So where were you?

1:27:50.560 --> 1:27:53.960
 I think you have some pics from that time.

1:27:53.960 --> 1:27:55.540
 Where were you in Russia?

1:27:55.540 --> 1:27:58.480
 So I spent a lot of time in kind of Western Russia as well,

1:27:58.480 --> 1:28:02.160
 but I did take two trips to Kamchatka,

1:28:02.160 --> 1:28:04.380
 including Northern Kamchatka.

1:28:04.380 --> 1:28:06.640
 I didn't go far enough,

1:28:06.640 --> 1:28:08.280
 I didn't go to Chukotka, for instance,

1:28:08.280 --> 1:28:11.160
 until more recently when I was a ship doctor

1:28:11.160 --> 1:28:15.640
 on a wildlife cruise that sailed from Anadyr, Russia,

1:28:15.640 --> 1:28:18.500
 up to, through the Bering Strait into Wrangell Island.

1:28:19.400 --> 1:28:21.440
 And we stopped in some villages in Chukotka

1:28:21.440 --> 1:28:25.220
 and I got a chance to try some whale and stuff like that.

1:28:25.220 --> 1:28:27.740
 Northern Kamchatka, where it's more the Koryak

1:28:27.740 --> 1:28:29.240
 are the indigenous people.

1:28:29.240 --> 1:28:30.480
 They do a lot of seal hunting,

1:28:30.480 --> 1:28:31.640
 so I had a lot of seal blubber,

1:28:31.640 --> 1:28:35.540
 but I don't believe they do any whale hunting quite there.

1:28:35.540 --> 1:28:38.020
 But the Chukchi in a way are sort of, you know,

1:28:38.020 --> 1:28:42.320
 similar to the Inupiat in their diet and their life ways.

1:28:42.320 --> 1:28:44.460
 Of course, everyone's diet, all these people's diet

1:28:44.460 --> 1:28:47.040
 has changed dramatically in the last 100 years,

1:28:47.040 --> 1:28:48.440
 as it has for actually everyone

1:28:48.440 --> 1:28:50.760
 living in kind of modern societies.

1:28:50.760 --> 1:28:52.600
 But for them, perhaps more than anyone else

1:28:52.600 --> 1:28:54.680
 since their diet was the most extreme,

1:28:54.680 --> 1:28:57.520
 I think of any human culture on earth.

1:28:57.520 --> 1:29:01.080
 Just to stay on the wild travel you did,

1:29:01.080 --> 1:29:03.440
 and I should say, I'm using the word travel,

1:29:03.440 --> 1:29:07.940
 but it really, you were a doctor there.

1:29:10.640 --> 1:29:13.080
 Well, first of all, can you just comment on the decision

1:29:13.080 --> 1:29:17.200
 to go to such places and to help people,

1:29:17.200 --> 1:29:18.280
 to be a doctor there?

1:29:18.280 --> 1:29:19.480
 What was the motivation?

1:29:19.480 --> 1:29:20.980
 What was the thinking behind it?

1:29:20.980 --> 1:29:22.660
 Well, I think I got the travel bug

1:29:22.660 --> 1:29:25.120
 before I ever went to medical school

1:29:25.120 --> 1:29:26.780
 and even wanted to be a doctor.

1:29:26.780 --> 1:29:31.280
 So right after college, I kind of wasn't very into college,

1:29:31.280 --> 1:29:33.960
 didn't enjoy things, kind of wanted to get out there

1:29:33.960 --> 1:29:36.560
 and see the world, get out of New York City

1:29:36.560 --> 1:29:38.780
 where I was a student at NYU.

1:29:39.780 --> 1:29:42.160
 The first thing I did after finishing college

1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:45.560
 was I was invited to be an intern at a research center

1:29:45.560 --> 1:29:47.300
 in St. Petersburg, Russia.

1:29:47.300 --> 1:29:49.180
 I spent six months there on my first trip

1:29:49.180 --> 1:29:52.560
 and went back four more times to Russia,

1:29:52.560 --> 1:29:55.840
 traveled all over, including to Kamchatka twice

1:29:55.840 --> 1:29:57.680
 and other parts of the country.

1:29:57.680 --> 1:30:00.680
 I'd never heard of cities like Petrozavodsk

1:30:00.680 --> 1:30:02.680
 and Syktyvkar and Pskov.

1:30:02.680 --> 1:30:05.720
 I didn't even know a word could start with P, S, K,

1:30:05.720 --> 1:30:07.680
 like the city of Pskov, but it can.

1:30:08.860 --> 1:30:10.920
 And I was sort of fascinated.

1:30:10.920 --> 1:30:12.880
 I was actually studying

1:30:12.880 --> 1:30:14.960
 the international environmental movement

1:30:14.960 --> 1:30:16.560
 and how it came to Russia

1:30:16.560 --> 1:30:18.520
 after the fall of the Soviet Union

1:30:18.520 --> 1:30:20.280
 and how organizations like Greenpeace

1:30:20.280 --> 1:30:23.200
 and World Wildlife Fund and the World Bank

1:30:23.200 --> 1:30:27.140
 are trying to kind of push the timber industry,

1:30:27.140 --> 1:30:29.920
 which is huge in Russia, toward a more sustainable path.

1:30:29.920 --> 1:30:32.860
 And so I was sort of evaluating how is it working?

1:30:32.860 --> 1:30:34.280
 If not, why not?

1:30:34.280 --> 1:30:36.320
 And that seems like such a little niche,

1:30:36.320 --> 1:30:38.880
 such a small detail about Russian society,

1:30:38.880 --> 1:30:41.600
 but in a way, researching that in depth

1:30:41.600 --> 1:30:44.680
 was almost this window into the entire country

1:30:44.680 --> 1:30:46.920
 and the history in a place I knew nothing about.

1:30:46.920 --> 1:30:50.760
 And I learned the language, traveled all over the country,

1:30:50.760 --> 1:30:53.040
 got to know the food, the history, the literature.

1:30:53.040 --> 1:30:55.320
 It was just an immersive and amazing

1:30:55.320 --> 1:30:56.640
 and life changing experience

1:30:56.640 --> 1:31:01.080
 that made me want to see every spot on the globe, basically,

1:31:01.080 --> 1:31:03.080
 and learn about every culture.

1:31:03.080 --> 1:31:06.240
 So I took that desire with me to medical school.

1:31:06.240 --> 1:31:08.400
 I decided I would go to medical school.

1:31:08.400 --> 1:31:10.120
 And from the very beginning,

1:31:10.120 --> 1:31:13.320
 I was intent on traveling around the world.

1:31:13.320 --> 1:31:16.200
 So a lot of my career has been fashioned

1:31:16.200 --> 1:31:18.360
 so that I'm practicing medicine in a place

1:31:18.360 --> 1:31:20.520
 with an interesting geographic context,

1:31:20.520 --> 1:31:24.400
 an interesting place with an interesting cultural context.

1:31:24.400 --> 1:31:27.520
 And that just makes it more interesting, I find.

1:31:27.520 --> 1:31:29.960
 Not only are medical services often more needed

1:31:29.960 --> 1:31:32.800
 in these remote and rural parts of the country and world,

1:31:32.800 --> 1:31:35.560
 so I feel like I'm taking my knowledge

1:31:35.560 --> 1:31:38.580
 and education experience to places where it's needed,

1:31:38.580 --> 1:31:39.420
 but also for me,

1:31:39.420 --> 1:31:41.920
 it's just such an enlightening experience,

1:31:41.920 --> 1:31:44.940
 the way culture, history, geography, climate

1:31:44.940 --> 1:31:46.600
 affects medical disease,

1:31:46.600 --> 1:31:47.880
 but just getting to know the people,

1:31:47.880 --> 1:31:49.700
 getting to know their culture,

1:31:49.700 --> 1:31:51.480
 being a very useful traveler

1:31:51.480 --> 1:31:54.760
 by providing medical services in that place.

1:31:54.760 --> 1:31:57.360
 And that's taken me to Arctic Alaska,

1:31:57.360 --> 1:31:59.440
 to Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota.

1:31:59.440 --> 1:32:01.400
 I currently work in a few different parts

1:32:01.400 --> 1:32:02.960
 of Pennsylvania, Appalachia,

1:32:02.960 --> 1:32:06.860
 which for me is a unique geography and culture

1:32:06.860 --> 1:32:08.920
 that I didn't grow up with, wasn't familiar with.

1:32:08.920 --> 1:32:12.480
 So in some ways, it's exotic for me as well.

1:32:12.480 --> 1:32:16.680
 I worked in other places too, like Kolkata, India, Nepal.

1:32:16.680 --> 1:32:20.600
 Just I think my love of travel has shaped my medical career

1:32:20.600 --> 1:32:23.500
 and being a doctor does give you these opportunities

1:32:23.500 --> 1:32:27.120
 to go to places and travel in a unique way

1:32:27.120 --> 1:32:28.760
 through the medical profession.

1:32:30.120 --> 1:32:31.340
 You know, there's a documentary,

1:32:31.340 --> 1:32:34.280
 Happy People Here in the Taiga or something like that.

1:32:35.760 --> 1:32:39.600
 I think Warner Herzog voices it.

1:32:39.600 --> 1:32:43.880
 It tells a story of a simple life of survival in the taiga

1:32:43.880 --> 1:32:47.200
 and I think they're trapping for food

1:32:47.200 --> 1:32:51.760
 and there's an alcoholism problem too as well.

1:32:51.760 --> 1:32:56.760
 There's like a very basic life of survival,

1:32:57.560 --> 1:32:59.560
 of loneliness, of desperation,

1:32:59.560 --> 1:33:03.240
 but also there's a, I think the underlying claim

1:33:04.940 --> 1:33:09.940
 of the documentary is that that simple life

1:33:09.940 --> 1:33:12.660
 that simple life actually has a kind

1:33:12.660 --> 1:33:17.660
 of simple happiness to it, hence the name Happy People.

1:33:20.540 --> 1:33:24.900
 Can you speak to the life that people live in those places

1:33:24.900 --> 1:33:28.660
 when it may be simpler than you would

1:33:28.660 --> 1:33:31.220
 in a sort of big city life?

1:33:32.540 --> 1:33:36.100
 It's definitely very different for sure.

1:33:36.100 --> 1:33:38.740
 You know, I guess I found like in some

1:33:38.740 --> 1:33:41.260
 of the remote villages of Kamchatka,

1:33:41.260 --> 1:33:44.760
 I was actually surprised how similar they were

1:33:44.760 --> 1:33:48.860
 in that I saw the same family strife,

1:33:48.860 --> 1:33:53.860
 the same fights, the same kind of pairing of relationships

1:33:55.020 --> 1:33:58.140
 and bickering and politics.

1:33:58.140 --> 1:34:01.060
 In a way, I'm from the New Jersey suburbs

1:34:01.060 --> 1:34:05.700
 and being in this remote village of Northern Kamchatka,

1:34:05.700 --> 1:34:07.240
 I remember writing an email to my friend

1:34:07.240 --> 1:34:08.980
 about how just it seemed so similar,

1:34:08.980 --> 1:34:12.540
 even though on the surface it was this exotic other world,

1:34:12.540 --> 1:34:15.540
 the incredible material know how they must have

1:34:15.540 --> 1:34:17.540
 to get their food from the land.

1:34:17.540 --> 1:34:19.980
 You know, that the number of animal species,

1:34:19.980 --> 1:34:22.260
 plant species, the behaviors of the animals,

1:34:22.260 --> 1:34:25.220
 seasons, how to live that way.

1:34:25.220 --> 1:34:27.000
 In a way, it's more complicated in a way

1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:29.620
 that I find fascinating how people live on the land

1:34:29.620 --> 1:34:31.420
 and the knowledge and experience it takes

1:34:31.420 --> 1:34:33.380
 to do it well and survive.

1:34:33.380 --> 1:34:35.900
 You know, obviously other aspects of modern life

1:34:35.900 --> 1:34:38.820
 in a city are much more complicated

1:34:38.820 --> 1:34:41.100
 than they would be there, but I guess it's,

1:34:41.100 --> 1:34:42.420
 that was something that struck me too,

1:34:42.420 --> 1:34:43.740
 that it's simpler in some ways,

1:34:43.740 --> 1:34:45.820
 but more complicated in other ways.

1:34:45.820 --> 1:34:48.500
 So some of the complexity that happens in life

1:34:48.500 --> 1:34:52.060
 is originated from humans, not from the technology

1:34:52.060 --> 1:34:54.280
 or all that kind of stuff around us.

1:34:55.500 --> 1:34:57.220
 You can take the human out of modernity,

1:34:57.220 --> 1:34:58.380
 but they're still human.

1:34:58.380 --> 1:35:01.080
 They're still human, and they fill the empty space

1:35:01.080 --> 1:35:03.340
 with their own human complexities.

1:35:03.340 --> 1:35:07.220
 Are there people that just stand out,

1:35:07.220 --> 1:35:11.520
 memorable people, memorable experiences from those places?

1:35:13.720 --> 1:35:18.220
 Some people that maybe made you smile, made you cry,

1:35:19.020 --> 1:35:21.200
 changed who you are as a man, changed who you are

1:35:21.200 --> 1:35:24.100
 as a doctor, anything jumps to mind?

1:35:24.100 --> 1:35:26.180
 I think, you know, when I was, it was interesting,

1:35:26.180 --> 1:35:29.800
 when I was in Russia, I found that most of the people

1:35:29.800 --> 1:35:31.780
 I hung out with were old women.

1:35:31.780 --> 1:35:32.840
 I'm not sure why.

1:35:32.840 --> 1:35:36.060
 I mean, actually I didn't meet a lot of old men in Russia,

1:35:36.060 --> 1:35:39.520
 which might speak to kind of life expectancy there

1:35:39.520 --> 1:35:41.140
 for men in particular.

1:35:41.140 --> 1:35:44.380
 But I found women, older Russian women,

1:35:44.380 --> 1:35:46.980
 including, you know, Russian from St. Petersburg

1:35:46.980 --> 1:35:49.860
 or some of the elderly women in Kamchatka,

1:35:49.860 --> 1:35:51.580
 who were, you know, some were Koriak,

1:35:51.580 --> 1:35:55.320
 some were half Koriak, half Russian, some were Chukchi.

1:35:55.320 --> 1:35:58.060
 I just found them to be so enlightening

1:35:58.060 --> 1:36:02.000
 the way they talked about history, about people,

1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:03.900
 so insightful about humanity, you know,

1:36:03.900 --> 1:36:05.860
 all they've lived through in the last 50 years

1:36:05.860 --> 1:36:07.940
 in some of these parts of Russia,

1:36:07.940 --> 1:36:10.400
 like the upheaval, societal upheaval,

1:36:10.400 --> 1:36:12.480
 the destruction, the building up.

1:36:12.480 --> 1:36:15.820
 It's just something I could not even imagine.

1:36:15.820 --> 1:36:18.500
 And I think their insights were just very,

1:36:18.500 --> 1:36:19.940
 I'm not thinking of anything in particular,

1:36:19.940 --> 1:36:21.840
 but I just remember I could listen

1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:24.140
 to some of these elderly women talk about their lives

1:36:24.140 --> 1:36:25.400
 for hours and hours.

1:36:25.400 --> 1:36:26.860
 I remember there was this older,

1:36:26.860 --> 1:36:31.300
 elderly blind Koriak woman who you would have thought

1:36:31.300 --> 1:36:34.140
 was the, you know, most country bumpkin of country bumpkin,

1:36:34.140 --> 1:36:35.580
 and yet she couldn't stop talking about

1:36:35.580 --> 1:36:38.380
 how much she loved reading Dostoevsky and Tolstoy,

1:36:38.380 --> 1:36:41.680
 which might also speak to the Soviet education system.

1:36:41.680 --> 1:36:43.860
 And it was just sort of surprising and fascinating,

1:36:43.860 --> 1:36:46.920
 and just those stories and perspectives on life

1:36:46.920 --> 1:36:48.780
 really stayed with me.

1:36:48.780 --> 1:36:52.260
 Yeah, with babushki.

1:36:53.740 --> 1:36:57.440
 There's a wisdom, there's a kindness.

1:36:57.440 --> 1:37:02.440
 I mean, I suppose that's true for older people in general,

1:37:06.160 --> 1:37:09.440
 but there's something about, it's not just Russia,

1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:14.440
 it's Eastern Europe, it's like this kind of look of wisdom,

1:37:17.320 --> 1:37:22.320
 and not just like sort of middle class wisdom

1:37:22.460 --> 1:37:23.720
 or something like that.

1:37:23.720 --> 1:37:28.720
 It's like I have seen some shit wisdom, I've seen it all.

1:37:30.120 --> 1:37:35.120
 And on the other side, I'm left here with a pragmatism

1:37:35.640 --> 1:37:39.680
 and a compassion, and also an ability to cook really well.

1:37:39.680 --> 1:37:41.520
 That's for sure, absolutely.

1:37:41.520 --> 1:37:44.880
 There's just this balance of just deep intelligence

1:37:44.880 --> 1:37:49.880
 and deep kindness, and yeah, I mean I part much of who I am

1:37:50.720 --> 1:37:53.080
 is because of the relationship I had with my grandmother

1:37:53.080 --> 1:37:58.080
 who was a Russian, Ukrainian born Russian grandmother.

1:38:01.920 --> 1:38:03.820
 Did you learn the Russian language?

1:38:03.820 --> 1:38:05.880
 I did, it's quite rusty at this point,

1:38:05.880 --> 1:38:10.160
 but I did, one of these wonderful elderly Russians

1:38:10.160 --> 1:38:12.600
 in St. Petersburg sort of adopted me.

1:38:12.600 --> 1:38:15.200
 I think that was another thing that a lot of these

1:38:15.200 --> 1:38:18.200
 elderly women on every side of the country

1:38:18.200 --> 1:38:21.760
 kind of adopted me or saw me as this real curiosity.

1:38:21.760 --> 1:38:26.320
 This was around 2002, 2003, it just wasn't common

1:38:26.320 --> 1:38:29.520
 for this sort of strange American to suddenly show up

1:38:29.520 --> 1:38:32.120
 in the middle of Kamchatka or even St. Petersburg,

1:38:32.120 --> 1:38:34.840
 and just absolutely ravenously curious

1:38:34.840 --> 1:38:36.520
 about everything they had to say.

1:38:36.520 --> 1:38:40.240
 So I often got adopted and one of them taught me Russian

1:38:40.240 --> 1:38:44.880
 and how to ride a horse, so the same babushka

1:38:44.880 --> 1:38:46.640
 taught me both of those things.

1:38:46.640 --> 1:38:48.680
 And like you said also, I should mention

1:38:48.680 --> 1:38:51.180
 that there's something about the Soviet education system

1:38:51.180 --> 1:38:54.680
 where yeah, everybody reads Tolstoy, Dostoevsky,

1:38:54.680 --> 1:38:56.640
 it's exceptionally well read.

1:38:56.640 --> 1:38:58.560
 No matter where life has taken you,

1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:00.320
 no matter where you come from,

1:39:00.320 --> 1:39:02.880
 the literature, the mathematics, the sciences,

1:39:02.880 --> 1:39:06.520
 they're all like extremely well educated

1:39:06.520 --> 1:39:10.080
 and that creates a fascinating populace.

1:39:12.240 --> 1:39:15.180
 Like then you take that education,

1:39:15.180 --> 1:39:18.400
 that excellent early education,

1:39:18.400 --> 1:39:22.080
 and you throw a bunch of hardship at those people

1:39:22.080 --> 1:39:26.420
 and then they kind of cook in that hardship

1:39:26.420 --> 1:39:29.320
 and come out really fascinating people on the other end.

1:39:30.580 --> 1:39:32.600
 It makes me surprised sort of that, for instance,

1:39:32.600 --> 1:39:35.820
 like Russian medical science is not,

1:39:35.820 --> 1:39:38.920
 doesn't, you don't see a lot of sort of studies,

1:39:38.920 --> 1:39:41.160
 medical studies, advancing of medical science

1:39:41.160 --> 1:39:42.440
 come out of Russia.

1:39:42.440 --> 1:39:44.680
 It's just sort of, I'm surprised sort of,

1:39:44.680 --> 1:39:45.920
 I wish that it would.

1:39:45.920 --> 1:39:49.440
 I visited Akademgorodok outside Novosibirsk,

1:39:49.440 --> 1:39:51.340
 which is an entire city the Soviets created

1:39:51.340 --> 1:39:52.600
 just for the study of science

1:39:52.600 --> 1:39:54.520
 and it's like there's the geology building

1:39:54.520 --> 1:39:55.920
 and there's the biology building

1:39:55.920 --> 1:39:57.460
 and there's the chemistry building

1:39:57.460 --> 1:40:00.360
 and I just feel like Russia has this potential

1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:03.120
 to be a science powerhouse or even in the medical sciences

1:40:03.120 --> 1:40:05.660
 but I guess you just, I don't see it.

1:40:05.660 --> 1:40:07.680
 I'm not sure why.

1:40:07.680 --> 1:40:10.600
 I mean, you can certainly guess as to why

1:40:10.600 --> 1:40:13.640
 and I see the same thing in the other,

1:40:13.640 --> 1:40:15.880
 in the sciences I hold the dearest sort of,

1:40:15.880 --> 1:40:19.600
 in computer science, in engineering fields.

1:40:20.780 --> 1:40:25.060
 I kind of long held this desire, by long,

1:40:25.060 --> 1:40:27.060
 I mean, last couple of years

1:40:27.060 --> 1:40:29.440
 because a bunch of people reached out to me

1:40:29.440 --> 1:40:33.080
 from Yandex and Moscow State to give lectures there

1:40:33.080 --> 1:40:34.320
 to sort of connect.

1:40:34.320 --> 1:40:37.720
 You know, why so little science is coming out of there?

1:40:37.720 --> 1:40:41.500
 Why so little that we hear about?

1:40:41.500 --> 1:40:42.640
 And it feels like we should be able

1:40:42.640 --> 1:40:44.800
 to bridge the scientific community.

1:40:44.800 --> 1:40:49.740
 Like science, let's even say,

1:40:49.740 --> 1:40:53.680
 even in turmoil of geopolitics, even in global conflict,

1:40:53.680 --> 1:40:56.720
 I feel like science should be bigger than that.

1:40:56.720 --> 1:41:00.400
 But why do we not hear from the scientists

1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:03.480
 is because of the limitations on human freedoms,

1:41:03.480 --> 1:41:05.060
 on scientific freedoms.

1:41:05.060 --> 1:41:09.120
 I feel like in China, in Russia,

1:41:09.120 --> 1:41:14.080
 in any regime of its sort, you should give freedom

1:41:14.080 --> 1:41:19.080
 to scientists to flourish and to interact with others

1:41:19.200 --> 1:41:20.880
 and you can only grow from that.

1:41:20.880 --> 1:41:22.280
 You shouldn't suppress that.

1:41:23.320 --> 1:41:27.400
 The sort of Cold War ideas, we should put those aside.

1:41:27.400 --> 1:41:31.160
 As somebody who spent time in Russia,

1:41:31.160 --> 1:41:34.120
 as somebody who learned Russian,

1:41:35.560 --> 1:41:38.600
 do you have some thoughts that you want to say

1:41:38.600 --> 1:41:40.400
 about the war in Ukraine currently?

1:41:41.920 --> 1:41:43.440
 It's tragic, of course.

1:41:44.560 --> 1:41:47.520
 Seemingly pointless to watch the destruction

1:41:47.520 --> 1:41:48.940
 of a country in real time.

1:41:51.560 --> 1:41:53.800
 I guess it's, you know, when you read Russian history

1:41:53.800 --> 1:41:55.840
 and Ukrainian history, I guess it just,

1:41:55.840 --> 1:41:59.960
 it's sort of, you know, destruction is a big part of it.

1:41:59.960 --> 1:42:02.780
 The populace being beaten down is a big part of it,

1:42:02.780 --> 1:42:05.600
 you know, from the Mongolian hordes

1:42:05.600 --> 1:42:09.160
 through the Tsar and the Soviets and Putin.

1:42:09.160 --> 1:42:11.680
 I guess, you know, it's just,

1:42:11.680 --> 1:42:13.520
 in science in particular, medical science,

1:42:13.520 --> 1:42:15.920
 it feels like this sort of unrealized potential.

1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:18.160
 You know, the culture is so beautiful,

1:42:18.160 --> 1:42:20.600
 the people are so smart and well educated.

1:42:20.600 --> 1:42:23.100
 I think the word unrealized potential

1:42:23.100 --> 1:42:24.400
 is kind of how I feel.

1:42:24.400 --> 1:42:27.580
 That's why I wanted to celebrate that part of the world

1:42:27.580 --> 1:42:29.380
 is there's so many beautiful people,

1:42:29.380 --> 1:42:31.040
 so many brilliant people.

1:42:31.920 --> 1:42:33.640
 And I just happen to know the language

1:42:33.640 --> 1:42:36.520
 so I'm able to appreciate the beauty of those people.

1:42:36.520 --> 1:42:38.680
 I'm sure the same is true in China.

1:42:38.680 --> 1:42:40.760
 I'm sure, that's one of the things that makes me sad

1:42:40.760 --> 1:42:44.680
 is there's all these cultures that I don't know about.

1:42:44.680 --> 1:42:46.400
 I can't fully appreciate their brilliance.

1:42:46.400 --> 1:42:48.640
 Even Japan and places like that

1:42:48.640 --> 1:42:52.280
 that are sort of, there's channels of communication

1:42:52.280 --> 1:42:54.240
 wide open and there's a lot of interaction.

1:42:54.240 --> 1:42:56.300
 It's still, not knowing the language,

1:42:56.300 --> 1:42:58.640
 I feel like I miss some of the culture.

1:42:58.640 --> 1:43:01.920
 Or Portuguese and, you know, looking at South America

1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:03.760
 and all that kind of stuff.

1:43:03.760 --> 1:43:06.920
 But anyway, in Russia there certainly is

1:43:06.920 --> 1:43:08.400
 that unrealized potential.

1:43:08.400 --> 1:43:12.060
 In Ukraine, so many brilliant scientists,

1:43:12.060 --> 1:43:14.520
 engineers came from Ukraine, from Russia.

1:43:14.520 --> 1:43:18.500
 And I hope they get to flourish soon.

1:43:18.500 --> 1:43:20.220
 And I hope we put this,

1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:25.740
 I hope we stop this war, because all war is hell.

1:43:29.140 --> 1:43:31.720
 Is there something to comment about the biology

1:43:31.720 --> 1:43:36.720
 of war, is there echoes of the emergency room experience?

1:43:41.880 --> 1:43:46.760
 Have you dealt with patients

1:43:46.760 --> 1:43:48.560
 that have been touched by war time?

1:43:49.920 --> 1:43:53.200
 Definitely, war and medicine has a very intricate

1:43:53.200 --> 1:43:54.920
 and complex relationship.

1:43:54.920 --> 1:43:57.120
 I don't know if it was Walt Whitman who said it,

1:43:57.120 --> 1:43:59.520
 though he was a nurse during the Civil War,

1:43:59.520 --> 1:44:01.480
 that war is the best medical school.

1:44:01.480 --> 1:44:03.820
 But some people have said that.

1:44:03.820 --> 1:44:08.720
 And even advancements in medicine come from war.

1:44:08.720 --> 1:44:12.200
 The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have, in some ways,

1:44:12.200 --> 1:44:14.180
 really revolutionized certain aspects

1:44:14.180 --> 1:44:15.920
 of the way we treat trauma patients

1:44:15.920 --> 1:44:17.640
 in the civilian world as well.

1:44:17.640 --> 1:44:20.080
 The importance of tourniquets,

1:44:20.080 --> 1:44:22.160
 the importance of transfusing whole blood

1:44:22.160 --> 1:44:25.300
 instead of red blood cells isolated from serum

1:44:25.300 --> 1:44:27.040
 and platelets, et cetera.

1:44:27.040 --> 1:44:29.240
 The importance of pain control in the battlefield,

1:44:29.240 --> 1:44:30.520
 that's changed dramatically.

1:44:30.520 --> 1:44:32.300
 Everything from ketamine injections

1:44:32.300 --> 1:44:35.600
 to fentanyl lollipops in the battlefield.

1:44:35.600 --> 1:44:39.080
 So war has really improved medicine in many ways.

1:44:39.080 --> 1:44:42.640
 In another way, the Department of Defense

1:44:42.640 --> 1:44:44.520
 spends a lot of money on medical research

1:44:44.520 --> 1:44:46.800
 and really pushes the envelope.

1:44:46.800 --> 1:44:50.120
 DARPA is one aspect of the military budget

1:44:50.120 --> 1:44:52.780
 that really funds these moonshot experiments

1:44:52.780 --> 1:44:56.720
 that are really fascinating and really push the frontiers

1:44:56.720 --> 1:45:00.720
 more than seemingly most kind of universities

1:45:00.720 --> 1:45:04.280
 doing doctors and researchers doing their research.

1:45:04.280 --> 1:45:06.860
 So in a way, the space program,

1:45:06.860 --> 1:45:08.520
 which sort of was military initially

1:45:08.520 --> 1:45:10.400
 then became civilian under NASA,

1:45:10.400 --> 1:45:13.600
 also has led to a lot of advances and understandings

1:45:13.600 --> 1:45:16.840
 of health on Earth and in space.

1:45:16.840 --> 1:45:20.560
 So the military or war in general is a huge way

1:45:20.560 --> 1:45:23.080
 that medicine advances,

1:45:23.080 --> 1:45:25.560
 not to mention the epidemics that come.

1:45:25.560 --> 1:45:28.480
 My grandmother was from what's today Moldova,

1:45:28.480 --> 1:45:29.680
 what was then Romania.

1:45:29.680 --> 1:45:33.240
 She got typhus during World War II.

1:45:33.240 --> 1:45:35.520
 So there's typhus outbreaks, there's cholera outbreaks,

1:45:35.520 --> 1:45:38.920
 you know, all these, even infectious disease things

1:45:38.920 --> 1:45:40.960
 can advance in war, which you wouldn't expect.

1:45:40.960 --> 1:45:43.660
 You expect sort of trauma to be the sort of main problem,

1:45:43.660 --> 1:45:45.920
 but actually infection is a huge problem

1:45:45.920 --> 1:45:46.980
 throughout history and war.

1:45:46.980 --> 1:45:48.660
 So we can learn a lot.

1:45:48.660 --> 1:45:51.380
 It's this kind of horrific natural experiment

1:45:51.380 --> 1:45:53.760
 in medical care.

1:45:53.760 --> 1:45:56.400
 Yeah, and I've recently been reading about

1:45:56.400 --> 1:45:59.200
 some of the horrific medical experiments

1:45:59.200 --> 1:46:03.640
 performed by Nazi scientists, Nazi Germany.

1:46:03.640 --> 1:46:05.800
 I'll talk about it another time perhaps,

1:46:05.800 --> 1:46:10.800
 but nothing reveals the honesty of human biology like war.

1:46:13.180 --> 1:46:16.260
 Just to stay on your wild journeys for a little bit longer,

1:46:17.700 --> 1:46:19.980
 you have a tweet about Shackleton saying,

1:46:19.980 --> 1:46:22.400
 here's a photo of Shackleton's medical kit

1:46:22.400 --> 1:46:26.360
 from his storied expedition to Antarctica in the 1910s.

1:46:26.360 --> 1:46:30.000
 Some perigoric for pain, some laxative.

1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:33.880
 Only the essentials.

1:46:33.880 --> 1:46:36.560
 Would you put laxative under the essentials?

1:46:36.560 --> 1:46:38.280
 Anyway, sorry to interrupt.

1:46:39.680 --> 1:46:44.040
 When I worked as a ship doctor in Antarctica in 2018,

1:46:44.040 --> 1:46:48.640
 I had a huge cabinet full of meds and even EKG machine.

1:46:48.640 --> 1:46:53.640
 So if you can comment sort of on that contrast.

1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:56.640
 First of all, your own journey, how harsh was it?

1:46:56.640 --> 1:46:58.360
 How difficult was it?

1:46:58.360 --> 1:47:02.640
 And given that context, can you think about

1:47:02.640 --> 1:47:05.280
 how hard Shackleton's journey was?

1:47:06.400 --> 1:47:09.760
 I think the difference is unimaginably stark.

1:47:09.760 --> 1:47:11.720
 One thing I do wanna point out is that

1:47:11.720 --> 1:47:14.240
 the use of laxatives early in the 20th century

1:47:14.240 --> 1:47:17.720
 and before that, they were used for a surprising

1:47:17.720 --> 1:47:21.100
 number of ailments where they probably did not help at all.

1:47:21.100 --> 1:47:23.640
 But I think that was a holdover from sort of

1:47:23.640 --> 1:47:26.080
 the old theory of medicine, the humoral theory

1:47:26.080 --> 1:47:28.720
 where you have to balance the fluids in the body.

1:47:28.720 --> 1:47:30.480
 And so causing people to vomit,

1:47:30.480 --> 1:47:34.000
 causing them to have diarrhea or purposely taking blood

1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:36.760
 out of them in bloodletting was a big part.

1:47:36.760 --> 1:47:38.960
 And I think that crazy use of laxatives

1:47:38.960 --> 1:47:41.800
 was maybe a holdover from that time.

1:47:41.800 --> 1:47:44.600
 But that being said, they were probably not eating

1:47:44.600 --> 1:47:47.120
 very high fiber food on that expedition.

1:47:47.120 --> 1:47:49.800
 So perhaps laxatives could have been helpful.

1:47:49.800 --> 1:47:54.320
 There's a lot of seal, penguin and seal meat being eaten,

1:47:54.320 --> 1:47:56.840
 which is not super high in fiber.

1:47:56.840 --> 1:47:58.560
 So I don't wanna discount the importance

1:47:58.560 --> 1:48:00.320
 of laxatives in that setting.

1:48:00.320 --> 1:48:02.120
 But that wouldn't be the essential thing.

1:48:02.120 --> 1:48:04.980
 If you're thinking of a tiny kit

1:48:04.980 --> 1:48:09.240
 that has only the essentials, I mean pain, yes.

1:48:09.240 --> 1:48:11.600
 Laxatives, I don't know, maybe not.

1:48:11.600 --> 1:48:13.720
 I think the medical kit possibilities

1:48:13.720 --> 1:48:16.260
 were much narrower back then.

1:48:16.260 --> 1:48:18.600
 This was before antibiotics,

1:48:18.600 --> 1:48:22.520
 before I think germ theory might've been,

1:48:22.520 --> 1:48:25.440
 it was known, but there wasn't much to do about it.

1:48:25.440 --> 1:48:27.640
 So the availability of medicines,

1:48:27.640 --> 1:48:29.040
 I mean, that's something that exploded

1:48:29.040 --> 1:48:30.440
 over the course of the 20th century.

1:48:30.440 --> 1:48:33.240
 So what I can put in a backpack today

1:48:33.240 --> 1:48:35.580
 filled with modern medications, whether injectable

1:48:35.580 --> 1:48:39.700
 or to be taken orally is just many orders of magnitude

1:48:39.700 --> 1:48:42.400
 greater than what they had back then.

1:48:42.400 --> 1:48:46.520
 So when I went, my expedition was nothing like Shackleton's.

1:48:46.520 --> 1:48:51.520
 I was on a huge cruise ship with 160 Japanese passengers

1:48:51.600 --> 1:48:53.720
 who came with their own translators.

1:48:53.720 --> 1:48:58.280
 And as I said, I had cabinets, not just one cabinet,

1:48:58.280 --> 1:49:00.520
 many cabinets full of medications,

1:49:00.520 --> 1:49:04.800
 both injectable, some patches, some pills.

1:49:04.800 --> 1:49:08.640
 I was very impressed actually with what was available there.

1:49:08.640 --> 1:49:11.160
 And I didn't have to use a lot of it, thankfully,

1:49:11.160 --> 1:49:13.120
 though I did use some of it for people.

1:49:14.760 --> 1:49:19.080
 And I slept and I got free room and board on the ship.

1:49:19.080 --> 1:49:22.440
 So every Southern summer cruise ships

1:49:22.440 --> 1:49:24.680
 go take people to Antarctica,

1:49:24.680 --> 1:49:26.760
 the Southern Atlantic islands like the Falklands

1:49:26.760 --> 1:49:29.200
 and other parts of the South Pacific.

1:49:29.200 --> 1:49:30.580
 And then in the Northern summer,

1:49:30.580 --> 1:49:34.160
 the same kind of cruise ship explosion happens

1:49:34.160 --> 1:49:36.440
 going to Greenland and Iceland and Svalbard

1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:40.360
 and Franz Josef Land and other parts of the North Alaska.

1:49:40.360 --> 1:49:42.900
 So, and every ship needs a doctor.

1:49:42.900 --> 1:49:44.800
 So it's a great opportunity.

1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:48.680
 They want specifically ER doctors to deal with emergencies,

1:49:48.680 --> 1:49:51.920
 but you're really working in the middle of nowhere.

1:49:51.920 --> 1:49:55.000
 And all you have is the medications there on the ship

1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:57.600
 and supplies and your knowledge and experience.

1:49:57.600 --> 1:49:59.840
 And so it's a very different experience

1:49:59.840 --> 1:50:02.000
 than working in a high tech modern hospital

1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:03.340
 with every bit of technology

1:50:03.340 --> 1:50:06.520
 and every sub specialist consultant available.

1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:08.120
 But I sort of liked that challenge.

1:50:08.120 --> 1:50:09.720
 I mean, I like going to the ends of the earth.

1:50:09.720 --> 1:50:12.920
 It's beautiful, it's exciting, it's fascinating.

1:50:12.920 --> 1:50:15.820
 Practicing medicine in those settings is extra challenging

1:50:15.820 --> 1:50:18.720
 and really makes you hone some of your skills,

1:50:18.720 --> 1:50:22.320
 which is part of the reason that I sought them out.

1:50:22.320 --> 1:50:25.160
 Do you see echoes of some of that same effort?

1:50:25.160 --> 1:50:27.400
 I've gotten a chance to interact with astronauts

1:50:27.400 --> 1:50:30.800
 and those kinds of folks working on space missions.

1:50:30.800 --> 1:50:34.800
 Do you see some of those same echoes of challenging efforts

1:50:34.800 --> 1:50:37.800
 going out into space and maybe landing on Mars

1:50:37.800 --> 1:50:42.240
 and maybe beginning to build a small colony on Mars?

1:50:42.240 --> 1:50:44.560
 Yeah, I think the healthcare that is needed

1:50:44.560 --> 1:50:46.080
 will be a big part of that.

1:50:46.080 --> 1:50:47.960
 Obviously, we're probably gonna send

1:50:47.960 --> 1:50:49.880
 overall quite healthy people,

1:50:49.880 --> 1:50:51.640
 but there's a lot of medical decisions to make

1:50:51.640 --> 1:50:54.600
 about what should be brought, what should be expected.

1:50:54.600 --> 1:50:57.320
 To some extent, I've had a lot of doctors say,

1:50:57.320 --> 1:50:58.720
 oh my goodness, I can't believe you work

1:50:58.720 --> 1:50:59.540
 in the middle of nowhere.

1:50:59.540 --> 1:51:02.280
 What do you do if someone gets a brain bleed,

1:51:02.280 --> 1:51:04.460
 like falls, hits their head, needs a neurosurgeon?

1:51:04.460 --> 1:51:06.620
 I mean, the obvious answer is they die.

1:51:06.620 --> 1:51:09.540
 You know, when you're in the middle of Antarctica,

1:51:09.540 --> 1:51:11.340
 things kill you that wouldn't

1:51:11.340 --> 1:51:13.640
 if you're inside a university hospital

1:51:13.640 --> 1:51:16.860
 that's fully equipped to help with every problem that arises.

1:51:16.860 --> 1:51:20.360
 Mars takes that to a crazy extreme, obviously.

1:51:20.360 --> 1:51:22.140
 I know that even going to Antarctica,

1:51:22.140 --> 1:51:24.320
 different countries have had different strategies.

1:51:24.320 --> 1:51:28.380
 I believe it was Australia used to kind of just,

1:51:28.380 --> 1:51:31.780
 in anticipation, remove people's gallbladders

1:51:31.780 --> 1:51:33.580
 just so that it wouldn't get inflamed

1:51:33.580 --> 1:51:36.060
 because that is a very common medical emergency.

1:51:36.060 --> 1:51:37.980
 So they would just remove it beforehand,

1:51:37.980 --> 1:51:39.780
 even though it was not diseased at all,

1:51:39.780 --> 1:51:41.420
 just so that while they're stuck in Antarctica

1:51:41.420 --> 1:51:44.660
 over the winter, for instance, that wouldn't be a problem.

1:51:44.660 --> 1:51:47.300
 You know, there's many other issues that can arise.

1:51:47.300 --> 1:51:49.700
 But so those are some decisions to make.

1:51:49.700 --> 1:51:51.140
 Maybe the people who go into Mars

1:51:51.140 --> 1:51:52.440
 should have their appendix removed,

1:51:52.440 --> 1:51:53.860
 their gallbladder removed.

1:51:53.860 --> 1:51:55.280
 Maybe they should have a cardiac cath

1:51:55.280 --> 1:51:56.940
 to see if they have coronary artery disease

1:51:56.940 --> 1:51:59.040
 just to know their chances of getting a heart attack there.

1:51:59.040 --> 1:52:00.660
 Though it's not always predictive.

1:52:00.660 --> 1:52:01.740
 You know, it's hard to predict

1:52:01.740 --> 1:52:02.720
 who's gonna get a heart attack,

1:52:02.720 --> 1:52:05.020
 but maybe with all the data around today,

1:52:05.020 --> 1:52:06.740
 we'll get better at predicting.

1:52:06.740 --> 1:52:07.940
 But that will be a huge part.

1:52:07.940 --> 1:52:09.300
 You know, we can't have people,

1:52:09.300 --> 1:52:11.700
 the few pioneers in a Mars colony

1:52:11.700 --> 1:52:13.100
 dying of heart attacks and things like that.

1:52:13.100 --> 1:52:13.940
 Don't anticipate stuff.

1:52:13.940 --> 1:52:15.620
 Would you go?

1:52:15.620 --> 1:52:18.620
 You've gone to some harsh conditions to be a doctor.

1:52:18.620 --> 1:52:21.180
 Would you go to Mars to be a doctor?

1:52:21.180 --> 1:52:24.660
 It would definitely be amazing, I think,

1:52:24.660 --> 1:52:26.580
 because I have a wife and two small children,

1:52:26.580 --> 1:52:30.460
 probably not in the cards for me at this point, but.

1:52:30.460 --> 1:52:33.140
 You humans with your human attachments.

1:52:33.140 --> 1:52:35.140
 Sex and death.

1:52:35.140 --> 1:52:39.220
 If you just put more priority on the death than the sex,

1:52:39.220 --> 1:52:42.420
 I think we would be better off.

1:52:42.420 --> 1:52:44.020
 No.

1:52:44.020 --> 1:52:45.020
 I would love to go to Mars.

1:52:45.020 --> 1:52:45.900
 And actually, you know,

1:52:45.900 --> 1:52:48.540
 I practice high altitude medicine in Nepal.

1:52:48.540 --> 1:52:50.540
 Space medicine is sort of an extension of that.

1:52:50.540 --> 1:52:53.260
 You know, the air is just much thinner, like nonexistent.

1:52:53.260 --> 1:52:54.980
 You know, as you go higher in the mountains,

1:52:54.980 --> 1:52:56.700
 the things that happen to human physiology

1:52:56.700 --> 1:52:59.100
 are very bizarre and strange

1:52:59.100 --> 1:53:01.980
 and still not well explained by science.

1:53:01.980 --> 1:53:04.300
 And in space, it's just like a crazy extension

1:53:04.300 --> 1:53:05.340
 of high altitude.

1:53:07.140 --> 1:53:10.100
 If I could just return to the, we didn't really,

1:53:10.100 --> 1:53:13.260
 I think we mentioned a little bit about the food you had.

1:53:13.260 --> 1:53:15.500
 Just if we can high level say,

1:53:15.500 --> 1:53:18.620
 what is the greatest meal you've ever had?

1:53:18.620 --> 1:53:21.020
 So your last meal, let's go.

1:53:21.020 --> 1:53:26.020
 If one more meal, I get to murder you after this.

1:53:26.060 --> 1:53:27.100
 This is your last day.

1:53:27.100 --> 1:53:28.180
 We get to spend it together.

1:53:28.180 --> 1:53:29.580
 Where in the world would you go?

1:53:29.580 --> 1:53:30.820
 What would you eat?

1:53:30.820 --> 1:53:35.820
 I would say the most delicious thing is bone marrow.

1:53:36.180 --> 1:53:38.100
 And I would love a full meal of bone marrow

1:53:38.100 --> 1:53:39.980
 for my last, last dish.

1:53:39.980 --> 1:53:43.060
 I did on my birthday in 2002,

1:53:43.060 --> 1:53:46.740
 ate a kilogram and a half of crab meat in Kamchatka.

1:53:46.740 --> 1:53:50.220
 And that was also amazingly delicious.

1:53:50.220 --> 1:53:52.500
 The king crab they have there is incredible.

1:53:52.500 --> 1:53:54.860
 But I would go with bone marrow,

1:53:54.860 --> 1:53:57.900
 which is I think just one of the most delicious foods.

1:53:57.900 --> 1:53:59.820
 And it's sort of this weird body part.

1:53:59.820 --> 1:54:01.980
 You know, it's basically all your stem cells,

1:54:01.980 --> 1:54:03.260
 not all of them, but the stem cells

1:54:03.260 --> 1:54:04.940
 that produce all your blood cells.

1:54:04.940 --> 1:54:07.580
 So they are spitting out billions of white blood cells,

1:54:07.580 --> 1:54:09.700
 red blood cells and platelets every day.

1:54:09.700 --> 1:54:12.500
 And there's a bunch of fat in there as well.

1:54:12.500 --> 1:54:14.380
 Just one of the places the body stores fat.

1:54:14.380 --> 1:54:17.300
 And so you basically add heat and that's all you need.

1:54:17.300 --> 1:54:18.700
 It's like the perfect food.

1:54:18.700 --> 1:54:19.540
 You add heat.

1:54:19.540 --> 1:54:22.180
 The fat for frying the stem cells is already there.

1:54:22.180 --> 1:54:25.460
 There's naturally a bone vessel to contain it all.

1:54:25.460 --> 1:54:27.580
 Probably add some flavor too.

1:54:27.580 --> 1:54:29.100
 It's like the perfect food.

1:54:29.100 --> 1:54:32.500
 Does it matter which animal?

1:54:33.300 --> 1:54:35.700
 I prefer a larger animal just so there's more of it.

1:54:35.700 --> 1:54:37.300
 I actually like, well that's true.

1:54:37.300 --> 1:54:39.140
 I actually really like sort of bone marrow

1:54:39.140 --> 1:54:40.660
 from like chicken bones.

1:54:40.660 --> 1:54:42.540
 Right, just sucking it out of the bone.

1:54:42.540 --> 1:54:46.660
 Yes, I'm known for leaving absolutely nothing edible

1:54:46.660 --> 1:54:48.820
 on the plate except bone itself.

1:54:48.820 --> 1:54:53.820
 There's one other human I know that loves bone marrow

1:54:54.620 --> 1:54:57.100
 as much as you do and that's Joe Rogan.

1:54:57.100 --> 1:55:01.460
 So go, it's unnatural how much that man loves bone marrow.

1:55:01.460 --> 1:55:02.420
 I understand why.

1:55:02.420 --> 1:55:03.260
 It's amazing.

1:55:03.260 --> 1:55:04.100
 I love the steak part.

1:55:04.100 --> 1:55:07.580
 The bone marrow, you know what, let me argue with you

1:55:07.580 --> 1:55:12.100
 because I don't know, it could be an acquired taste

1:55:12.100 --> 1:55:16.340
 but there's just too much, it's like too much

1:55:17.540 --> 1:55:19.220
 with too little work for it.

1:55:20.380 --> 1:55:23.700
 Like it's as if you gave me lobster meat

1:55:23.700 --> 1:55:27.540
 without the lobster having to clean the lobster.

1:55:27.540 --> 1:55:30.540
 I just feel like I'm spoiling myself.

1:55:30.540 --> 1:55:33.460
 So it's very fatty, it's, I don't know,

1:55:33.460 --> 1:55:36.140
 maybe I wanna work for something that tastes like that.

1:55:36.140 --> 1:55:37.540
 Well if you start from the whole animal,

1:55:37.540 --> 1:55:39.300
 you do have to work to get at it, right?

1:55:39.300 --> 1:55:43.220
 A lot of animals have the teeth and the jaw muscles

1:55:43.220 --> 1:55:45.020
 to chomp through bone, we do not.

1:55:45.020 --> 1:55:49.300
 So when you buy it from the store, it's already sawed up

1:55:49.300 --> 1:55:52.220
 but I've definitely gotten marrow out of deer bones

1:55:52.220 --> 1:55:55.260
 with a hatchet, just chop off the fat end

1:55:55.260 --> 1:55:56.500
 and start spooning it out.

1:55:56.500 --> 1:55:59.020
 Or maybe I'll revisit it, that's fascinating.

1:55:59.020 --> 1:56:01.820
 And where, where would you eat it?

1:56:01.820 --> 1:56:04.180
 Where and which place of the world?

1:56:04.180 --> 1:56:08.940
 Is there something about who cooks it, who you eat it with?

1:56:10.740 --> 1:56:12.340
 You're not allowed to pick your family.

1:56:12.340 --> 1:56:13.180
 Right.

1:56:13.180 --> 1:56:14.020
 Uh.

1:56:14.020 --> 1:56:14.860
 Uh.

1:56:14.860 --> 1:56:15.700
 Uh.

1:56:15.700 --> 1:56:17.340
 Uh.

1:56:17.340 --> 1:56:21.340
 So like which place in the world, rural or in the city,

1:56:21.340 --> 1:56:22.460
 those kinds of things, you've been

1:56:22.460 --> 1:56:24.260
 to so many fascinating places.

1:56:25.780 --> 1:56:28.180
 I would say I'm, Antarctica I would say

1:56:28.180 --> 1:56:31.260
 is one of the most picturesque places I've ever been.

1:56:31.260 --> 1:56:34.900
 I really did not, I didn't know how mountainous it was

1:56:34.900 --> 1:56:37.220
 and I guess I knew there'd be ice

1:56:37.220 --> 1:56:39.540
 but just I didn't know how much ice it was.

1:56:39.540 --> 1:56:42.140
 You know, it's ice and mountains just overwhelming.

1:56:42.140 --> 1:56:45.180
 I just, you know, as kind of overwhelming bone marrow

1:56:45.180 --> 1:56:48.160
 might seem to you, sort of that feast for your eyes.

1:56:48.160 --> 1:56:51.680
 And just ice in general is amazing,

1:56:51.680 --> 1:56:54.040
 like the icebergs floating around Antarctica

1:56:54.040 --> 1:56:56.640
 is just astounding, like the different shapes,

1:56:56.640 --> 1:56:59.560
 the sizes are incredible.

1:56:59.560 --> 1:57:02.120
 There's actually a, I believe it's a US Navy website

1:57:02.120 --> 1:57:03.960
 that tracks the largest icebergs

1:57:03.960 --> 1:57:06.480
 and you can read about each of them and how big they are

1:57:06.480 --> 1:57:10.080
 and just the formations you see, similar up near Greenland,

1:57:10.080 --> 1:57:12.560
 though I have not been to Greenland.

1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:14.380
 Just ice in general is just amazing.

1:57:14.380 --> 1:57:16.280
 So I could just look at its different forms

1:57:16.280 --> 1:57:18.560
 while eating bone marrow forever, until you kill me,

1:57:18.560 --> 1:57:19.400
 that is.

1:57:19.400 --> 1:57:21.560
 Yeah, and afterwards we go.

1:57:21.560 --> 1:57:23.920
 There's back to the death, the death and sex.

1:57:25.360 --> 1:57:26.880
 What is it about the ice?

1:57:26.880 --> 1:57:29.720
 Is it sort of the enormity of nature

1:57:29.720 --> 1:57:33.360
 that just reminds you that it's going to be there

1:57:33.360 --> 1:57:35.120
 before you and after?

1:57:35.120 --> 1:57:37.160
 And then you get to partake in the eating

1:57:37.160 --> 1:57:41.920
 of the thing you need for maintaining of your biological,

1:57:42.780 --> 1:57:44.460
 temporary biological organism?

1:57:44.460 --> 1:57:47.160
 Yeah, I think it's a few things.

1:57:47.160 --> 1:57:49.400
 One is just the shapes that you see,

1:57:49.400 --> 1:57:53.520
 the wave action, just eating away at these pieces of ice.

1:57:53.520 --> 1:57:55.940
 You get these arches and just these shapes.

1:57:55.940 --> 1:57:56.780
 I mean, it's just like.

1:57:56.780 --> 1:57:57.620
 Geometry.

1:57:57.620 --> 1:57:59.400
 The geometry alone is amazing.

1:57:59.400 --> 1:58:01.200
 I studied math as an undergrad

1:58:01.200 --> 1:58:03.880
 and I've always appreciated geometry

1:58:04.840 --> 1:58:07.980
 and just the shapes alone are just look like brilliant works

1:58:07.980 --> 1:58:10.980
 of modernist art and just obviously no two

1:58:10.980 --> 1:58:12.660
 are ever the same.

1:58:12.660 --> 1:58:16.100
 Not to mention a lot of them are this unearthly blue color

1:58:16.100 --> 1:58:18.960
 that is just really startling and fascinating.

1:58:18.960 --> 1:58:22.920
 The same color of glaciers in various parts of the world,

1:58:22.920 --> 1:58:26.260
 that blue color is just really amazing.

1:58:26.260 --> 1:58:29.800
 And I also just love how it's sort of this constant shedding

1:58:29.800 --> 1:58:32.120
 from our Antarctic continent, from Greenland.

1:58:32.120 --> 1:58:34.480
 It's this constant process of snow falling inland

1:58:34.480 --> 1:58:37.000
 and pushing the glaciers further out to sea

1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:38.600
 and them breaking loose.

1:58:38.600 --> 1:58:41.080
 I mean, obviously it seems to be happening faster these days,

1:58:41.080 --> 1:58:43.280
 but it's sort of this constant shedding

1:58:43.280 --> 1:58:45.080
 and sort of, I always like thinking about

1:58:45.080 --> 1:58:46.560
 how the body has something similar.

1:58:46.560 --> 1:58:48.560
 We're constantly shedding and renewing

1:58:48.560 --> 1:58:51.400
 and rebuilding everything.

1:58:51.400 --> 1:58:55.200
 And so ice is sort of this constant similar process.

1:58:56.920 --> 1:59:00.600
 Yeah, I did not know you were a math undergrad.

1:59:00.600 --> 1:59:03.640
 So that, I mean, you just keep getting more fascinating.

1:59:05.360 --> 1:59:08.200
 Can you maybe take a small step into that direction?

1:59:08.200 --> 1:59:11.960
 What do you find beautiful about mathematics?

1:59:11.960 --> 1:59:15.520
 Why did you journey into that part of the world for a time?

1:59:15.520 --> 1:59:16.680
 I liked math.

1:59:16.680 --> 1:59:18.560
 I especially liked, so college math,

1:59:18.560 --> 1:59:20.680
 I did some calculus in high school.

1:59:20.680 --> 1:59:22.000
 When I got to college math,

1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:25.200
 I was amazed that there were no more numbers.

1:59:25.200 --> 1:59:26.660
 The digits disappeared.

1:59:26.660 --> 1:59:29.540
 It was just variables, concepts.

1:59:30.480 --> 1:59:32.300
 There was almost no more numbers at all.

1:59:32.300 --> 1:59:37.300
 It was like this totally abstract kind of way of thinking.

1:59:37.300 --> 1:59:39.160
 But that sort of reflects the natural world

1:59:39.160 --> 1:59:40.840
 and teaches you about the natural world,

1:59:40.840 --> 1:59:44.160
 though it's sort of this perfect platonic ideal,

1:59:44.160 --> 1:59:45.600
 perhaps, of the natural world

1:59:45.600 --> 1:59:47.840
 that can still sort of help explain

1:59:47.840 --> 1:59:49.280
 what happens in the natural world.

1:59:49.280 --> 1:59:53.800
 But just these concepts are so abstract from life

1:59:53.800 --> 1:59:56.280
 and from the natural world.

1:59:56.280 --> 1:59:58.360
 I was actually getting interested in the natural world

1:59:58.360 --> 2:00:02.560
 at the same time when I was at NYU studying math.

2:00:02.560 --> 2:00:05.320
 I took a tour of Central Park that was pointing,

2:00:05.320 --> 2:00:07.440
 the guy, Steve Brill, was pointing out

2:00:07.440 --> 2:00:09.120
 these wild edible plants.

2:00:09.120 --> 2:00:11.360
 And I was learning to identify the first plants

2:00:11.360 --> 2:00:13.280
 and knowing what's edible, what's not.

2:00:13.280 --> 2:00:15.160
 That was totally fascinating.

2:00:15.160 --> 2:00:16.800
 And sort of this kind of thing

2:00:16.800 --> 2:00:18.640
 that I felt like was connecting me to nature.

2:00:18.640 --> 2:00:23.160
 And it was balanced with this utterly abstract science,

2:00:23.160 --> 2:00:26.600
 or utterly abstract lessons I was getting in math class

2:00:26.600 --> 2:00:28.520
 where I was thinking through series.

2:00:28.520 --> 2:00:31.080
 As we approach infinity, what happens to these equations?

2:00:31.080 --> 2:00:34.560
 And concepts of like rings and abstract algebra,

2:00:34.560 --> 2:00:37.120
 I don't know, it was just this dichotomy

2:00:37.120 --> 2:00:40.080
 that I enjoyed both aspects of.

2:00:40.080 --> 2:00:41.860
 Yeah, the concepts.

2:00:41.860 --> 2:00:46.780
 But so different, this kind of logical,

2:00:48.520 --> 2:00:52.040
 rigorous view of the world and the world of biology.

2:00:52.040 --> 2:00:55.640
 Why the big, how did that feel to take the leap

2:00:55.640 --> 2:01:00.640
 into the biological, the mushy mess of the human body

2:01:00.640 --> 2:01:04.760
 from the mathematical, which is all very clean?

2:01:04.760 --> 2:01:07.320
 Right, it does feel like a big step.

2:01:07.320 --> 2:01:09.760
 I think there's more connection than you think.

2:01:09.760 --> 2:01:12.520
 We talked about symmetry of the body earlier.

2:01:12.520 --> 2:01:13.880
 That is a real thing.

2:01:13.880 --> 2:01:18.180
 Fluid dynamics of how our various bodily fluids flow

2:01:18.180 --> 2:01:20.100
 and what makes them not flow as well

2:01:20.100 --> 2:01:21.600
 and what makes them flow better.

2:01:21.600 --> 2:01:26.060
 All these different aspects of science go into the body.

2:01:26.060 --> 2:01:31.060
 Everything from hard bone to softer kind of flesh

2:01:31.980 --> 2:01:35.220
 to liquids of various consistencies.

2:01:36.220 --> 2:01:38.980
 A lot of science and math does teach you

2:01:38.980 --> 2:01:41.500
 about kind of how the body works, how it can work better,

2:01:41.500 --> 2:01:43.860
 what happens in sort of disease states.

2:01:45.660 --> 2:01:49.100
 Yeah, I suppose there's a connection.

2:01:49.100 --> 2:01:54.100
 There's also kind of a sort of computational biology

2:01:54.100 --> 2:01:58.540
 of this computational equivalence of each of the disciplines

2:01:58.540 --> 2:02:00.740
 which are becoming more and more fascinating

2:02:00.740 --> 2:02:02.780
 with all the work that DeepMind is doing

2:02:02.780 --> 2:02:04.860
 and the work of genetics, all that kind of stuff,

2:02:04.860 --> 2:02:06.940
 simulating different parts of the body

2:02:06.940 --> 2:02:09.840
 to try to gain an intuition understanding of it.

2:02:09.840 --> 2:02:12.740
 That to me is super fascinating,

2:02:12.740 --> 2:02:15.260
 but sometimes it does feel like an oversimplification

2:02:15.260 --> 2:02:16.620
 of the way the body really does it

2:02:16.620 --> 2:02:21.620
 because the body is an incredibly weird complex system

2:02:21.620 --> 2:02:25.020
 and it finds a way.

2:02:25.020 --> 2:02:27.320
 The adaptability, the resilience,

2:02:27.320 --> 2:02:31.140
 the redundancy that's built in, it's weird.

2:02:31.140 --> 2:02:34.760
 It's incredibly powerful and so unlike

2:02:34.760 --> 2:02:38.500
 the kind of computer based systems that we build,

2:02:38.500 --> 2:02:41.220
 at least we engineer in the software engineering world,

2:02:41.220 --> 2:02:43.820
 which kind of starts to make you think

2:02:43.820 --> 2:02:47.840
 how can we engineer computer systems in a different way

2:02:47.840 --> 2:02:50.540
 that make them more resilient in the real world?

2:02:50.540 --> 2:02:52.580
 That's sort of the robotics question.

2:02:53.900 --> 2:02:55.400
 What do you think about that?

2:02:55.400 --> 2:02:59.100
 What does it take to build a humanoid robot

2:02:59.100 --> 2:03:02.420
 or robots that are as resilient as the human body?

2:03:02.420 --> 2:03:04.100
 How difficult do you think is that problem?

2:03:04.100 --> 2:03:06.540
 Having studied the human body,

2:03:06.540 --> 2:03:10.620
 how hard is the engineering problem of building systems

2:03:10.620 --> 2:03:13.000
 like that guy over there, the legged guy

2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:15.640
 that is as resilient as the human body

2:03:15.640 --> 2:03:18.460
 to the harsh conditions of the real world?

2:03:18.460 --> 2:03:20.860
 I think it's very hard

2:03:20.860 --> 2:03:22.340
 and we definitely haven't gotten there yet.

2:03:22.340 --> 2:03:23.860
 I think we could probably learn lessons

2:03:23.860 --> 2:03:26.460
 from people who are trying to grow artificial organs

2:03:26.460 --> 2:03:29.700
 in the lab to eventually transplant into people,

2:03:29.700 --> 2:03:31.300
 which would solve a huge problem

2:03:31.300 --> 2:03:33.360
 of needing to get those organs from others

2:03:33.360 --> 2:03:35.900
 and the rejection of putting a foreign material

2:03:35.900 --> 2:03:37.180
 inside your body.

2:03:37.180 --> 2:03:39.340
 Your immune system tends not to like that.

2:03:39.340 --> 2:03:42.700
 That has advanced a lot recently.

2:03:42.700 --> 2:03:46.740
 I think some advances actually have been

2:03:46.740 --> 2:03:48.980
 where we pay a lot of attention to stem cells,

2:03:48.980 --> 2:03:49.940
 stem cells, stem cells.

2:03:49.940 --> 2:03:51.820
 We can grow whatever we want out of stem cells,

2:03:51.820 --> 2:03:54.220
 but now there's sort of a recognition

2:03:54.220 --> 2:03:57.140
 that what we call the extracellular matrix,

2:03:57.140 --> 2:04:00.200
 which is sort of the foundation of the body,

2:04:00.200 --> 2:04:02.900
 the thing that holds all the cells into their proper shape

2:04:02.900 --> 2:04:04.700
 and keeps them where they should be,

2:04:05.940 --> 2:04:07.100
 that is actually crucial.

2:04:07.100 --> 2:04:09.220
 And there's probably a lot of signaling that goes on.

2:04:09.220 --> 2:04:11.140
 Like you stick a stem cell

2:04:11.140 --> 2:04:12.760
 on the right extracellular matrix,

2:04:12.760 --> 2:04:14.860
 it will turn into the kind of cell that you want

2:04:14.860 --> 2:04:16.400
 and take the right shape and position

2:04:16.400 --> 2:04:17.940
 and start functioning.

2:04:17.940 --> 2:04:21.260
 I think that's been a huge, huge advance

2:04:21.260 --> 2:04:24.640
 knowing that it's not just these celebrity stem cells

2:04:24.640 --> 2:04:25.480
 that are the answer.

2:04:25.480 --> 2:04:27.900
 It's this kind of part in the background,

2:04:27.900 --> 2:04:29.700
 this sort of just like laying the foundation,

2:04:29.700 --> 2:04:32.180
 the system that you put these cells onto.

2:04:32.180 --> 2:04:33.280
 And we're not there yet,

2:04:33.280 --> 2:04:35.500
 but there's definitely a lot happening,

2:04:35.500 --> 2:04:36.620
 a lot of research happening.

2:04:36.620 --> 2:04:39.660
 And I think there'll be some advances probably soon.

2:04:39.660 --> 2:04:42.700
 So now on the topic of interaction

2:04:42.700 --> 2:04:47.500
 of computational systems with biology.

2:04:47.500 --> 2:04:49.620
 So if you look at a company like Neuralink

2:04:49.620 --> 2:04:53.180
 or the whole effort of brain computer interfaces,

2:04:53.180 --> 2:04:55.700
 now there's a neurosurgery component there.

2:04:56.660 --> 2:04:59.880
 We have to connect electrical systems

2:05:02.020 --> 2:05:04.460
 with biological systems.

2:05:04.460 --> 2:05:08.100
 So just even the implanting is difficult.

2:05:09.100 --> 2:05:11.060
 Then the communication is difficult.

2:05:11.060 --> 2:05:13.660
 But what would you say from what you know about the brain,

2:05:13.660 --> 2:05:15.300
 what you know about the human body

2:05:15.300 --> 2:05:18.300
 and all the beautiful mess that's there,

2:05:18.300 --> 2:05:20.580
 how difficult is the effort of Neuralink?

2:05:20.580 --> 2:05:22.380
 Do you think it's feasible?

2:05:22.380 --> 2:05:24.860
 I think it's definitely feasible.

2:05:24.860 --> 2:05:27.980
 I think we need to probably know more than we do

2:05:27.980 --> 2:05:31.500
 and know how to connect it in all these ways.

2:05:31.500 --> 2:05:33.900
 I think some advances, for instance,

2:05:34.940 --> 2:05:38.100
 much less sexy, but really already impacting medical care

2:05:38.100 --> 2:05:40.300
 is something called deep brain stimulation,

2:05:40.300 --> 2:05:42.260
 which is done for Parkinson's disease and others

2:05:42.260 --> 2:05:45.820
 where neurosurgeons implant this device

2:05:45.820 --> 2:05:48.980
 that's electrically stimulates the part of the brain

2:05:48.980 --> 2:05:51.620
 that is not functioning in Parkinson's disease.

2:05:51.620 --> 2:05:53.740
 And it's quite dramatic how effective it works.

2:05:53.740 --> 2:05:55.220
 And I remember as a med student,

2:05:55.220 --> 2:05:58.940
 watching a neurologist literally like turn the electricity

2:05:58.940 --> 2:06:00.360
 up on this handheld thing,

2:06:00.360 --> 2:06:03.060
 and you could see the person's Parkinson tremor go away

2:06:03.060 --> 2:06:04.660
 and you could see them start to walk

2:06:04.660 --> 2:06:06.640
 in a more steady fashion.

2:06:06.640 --> 2:06:09.380
 And I know there's studies, there's actually studies

2:06:09.380 --> 2:06:11.980
 or there may be studies in the future

2:06:11.980 --> 2:06:14.140
 studying the same deep brain stimulation

2:06:14.140 --> 2:06:18.420
 for everything from eating disorders to severe,

2:06:18.420 --> 2:06:21.080
 like severe OCD, like paralyzing OCD,

2:06:21.080 --> 2:06:23.260
 not just like I wanna wash my hands three times,

2:06:23.260 --> 2:06:28.260
 but and so I think the potential is there,

2:06:29.100 --> 2:06:33.500
 but I guess connecting the brain in a microscopic way

2:06:33.500 --> 2:06:35.500
 in sort of a multifaceted way,

2:06:35.500 --> 2:06:37.300
 there needs to be sort of a million connections

2:06:37.300 --> 2:06:39.460
 or some very high number of connections

2:06:39.460 --> 2:06:40.500
 for them to work fluidly.

2:06:40.500 --> 2:06:43.300
 As far as I know, I'm not an expert in the area.

2:06:43.300 --> 2:06:45.640
 First of all, I believe and I trust

2:06:45.640 --> 2:06:47.820
 in the adaptability of the biological system

2:06:47.820 --> 2:06:50.900
 to whatever crazy stuff you try to shove in there.

2:06:50.900 --> 2:06:54.020
 So it's going to potentially reject things,

2:06:54.020 --> 2:06:57.740
 but it's also going to, if it doesn't reject things, adapt.

2:06:57.740 --> 2:07:01.860
 And if we can create computational systems that also adapt,

2:07:01.860 --> 2:07:05.140
 AI systems that adapt and can kinda,

2:07:05.140 --> 2:07:07.260
 both of them reach towards each other

2:07:07.260 --> 2:07:08.820
 and figure stuff out.

2:07:08.820 --> 2:07:12.140
 But actually our current AI systems are not very adaptable

2:07:13.260 --> 2:07:15.980
 to the what, like in the wild way

2:07:15.980 --> 2:07:19.540
 that biology is adaptable, like adaptable to anything.

2:07:19.540 --> 2:07:21.820
 And if we can build AI systems like that,

2:07:21.820 --> 2:07:24.040
 I feel like there's some interesting things you could do,

2:07:24.040 --> 2:07:25.820
 but of course there's ethics

2:07:25.820 --> 2:07:29.900
 and there's real human lives at stake.

2:07:29.900 --> 2:07:32.860
 And there you can't quite experiment.

2:07:32.860 --> 2:07:35.060
 You have to have things that work

2:07:35.060 --> 2:07:38.020
 and maybe simulation can help, but reality is,

2:07:40.260 --> 2:07:42.780
 it's a dangerous playground to play on.

2:07:44.220 --> 2:07:45.560
 It is messy.

2:07:45.560 --> 2:07:46.880
 You tweeted that quote,

2:07:46.880 --> 2:07:49.720
 "'If you look back from far enough into the future,

2:07:49.720 --> 2:07:53.000
 "'every doctor today will look like a total quack.'"

2:07:56.660 --> 2:07:58.860
 First of all, that's humbling to think about.

2:08:00.100 --> 2:08:03.500
 Like we don't know what we're doing in the great,

2:08:03.500 --> 2:08:05.840
 like there's been so much progress

2:08:05.840 --> 2:08:07.660
 that we kinda have this confidence

2:08:07.660 --> 2:08:09.500
 that we figured it all out.

2:08:09.500 --> 2:08:13.100
 If you look at history and you read how people thought,

2:08:13.100 --> 2:08:14.740
 I mean, there's so many moments in history

2:08:14.740 --> 2:08:18.260
 where people really thought that they figured it all out.

2:08:18.260 --> 2:08:21.640
 It's almost like there's nothing else left to do

2:08:21.640 --> 2:08:23.760
 at every stage in history.

2:08:23.760 --> 2:08:25.820
 And then you realize no,

2:08:25.820 --> 2:08:30.120
 progress often happens like exponentially.

2:08:30.120 --> 2:08:32.140
 And every moment you continue to think

2:08:32.140 --> 2:08:33.540
 you figured it all out.

2:08:33.540 --> 2:08:37.540
 But if you're being honest, if you're being humble,

2:08:37.540 --> 2:08:39.500
 then you realize we're just shrouded in mystery.

2:08:39.500 --> 2:08:41.620
 So what do we make of this?

2:08:41.620 --> 2:08:42.860
 Like how should we feel that?

2:08:42.860 --> 2:08:44.980
 How should you feel as a doctor?

2:08:44.980 --> 2:08:49.020
 How should we feel as scientific explorers

2:08:49.020 --> 2:08:50.100
 of the human body?

2:08:50.100 --> 2:08:52.020
 The fact that we're probably going to be wrong

2:08:52.020 --> 2:08:54.740
 about everything we currently know.

2:08:54.740 --> 2:08:56.740
 Right, there's a saying actually,

2:08:56.740 --> 2:08:58.100
 by the time you finish med school,

2:08:58.100 --> 2:09:00.620
 half of what you learned is wrong,

2:09:00.620 --> 2:09:02.460
 which is quite illustrative.

2:09:02.460 --> 2:09:05.780
 And becoming more true as time goes on,

2:09:05.780 --> 2:09:07.360
 so much medical research going on,

2:09:07.360 --> 2:09:10.780
 so much learning going on, it's really wonderful in a way.

2:09:10.780 --> 2:09:13.720
 But in some ways we still learn these concepts

2:09:13.720 --> 2:09:14.560
 from the past.

2:09:14.560 --> 2:09:17.640
 And I know when you take a test as a medical student,

2:09:17.640 --> 2:09:22.100
 sometimes you know they want you to give the old answer,

2:09:22.100 --> 2:09:23.380
 but you know there's a new answer

2:09:23.380 --> 2:09:24.460
 because of recent science,

2:09:24.460 --> 2:09:26.020
 but you know to give the old answer,

2:09:26.020 --> 2:09:28.500
 that's now incorrect to get the question right on the test.

2:09:28.500 --> 2:09:30.260
 That happens actually quite a bit

2:09:30.260 --> 2:09:32.020
 because things change so quickly.

2:09:33.340 --> 2:09:35.580
 Yet, you know, when I look back at doctors

2:09:35.580 --> 2:09:38.020
 from centuries past, I mean, it's absurd

2:09:38.020 --> 2:09:39.580
 what they were doing to their patients.

2:09:39.580 --> 2:09:41.420
 I mean, for probably for most of human history,

2:09:41.420 --> 2:09:43.300
 they were doing more harm than good.

2:09:43.300 --> 2:09:46.340
 You know, they're draining people of their blood.

2:09:46.340 --> 2:09:48.380
 That was, you know, bloodletting was a huge part

2:09:48.380 --> 2:09:51.040
 of medical care.

2:09:51.040 --> 2:09:55.300
 You know, George Washington died of a paratonsular abscess,

2:09:55.300 --> 2:09:57.220
 an abscess right next to the tonsil,

2:09:57.220 --> 2:09:59.220
 which has the great name of Quincy,

2:09:59.220 --> 2:10:00.300
 and they bled him to death.

2:10:00.300 --> 2:10:02.820
 You know, I mean, kind of adding insult to injury.

2:10:02.820 --> 2:10:05.740
 Doctors are a menace and do a lot of harm.

2:10:05.740 --> 2:10:07.580
 I mean, hopefully not intentionally.

2:10:07.580 --> 2:10:10.740
 You know, even medical errors are still a huge problem,

2:10:10.740 --> 2:10:13.660
 cause of death and morbidity.

2:10:13.660 --> 2:10:16.460
 So we do a lot of things that are not great,

2:10:16.460 --> 2:10:18.100
 but you know, our knowledge, yeah,

2:10:18.100 --> 2:10:19.700
 it's very imperfect at this point.

2:10:19.700 --> 2:10:21.520
 I do have some confidence.

2:10:21.520 --> 2:10:24.980
 You know, I guess perfect scientific studies

2:10:24.980 --> 2:10:29.000
 that try to get at the reality of the universe are essential

2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:33.380
 because when I think of why a certain medication works

2:10:33.380 --> 2:10:34.380
 for a certain condition,

2:10:34.380 --> 2:10:36.140
 it might make perfect sense in my head,

2:10:36.140 --> 2:10:38.980
 knowing the biology, the biochemistry, the anatomy,

2:10:38.980 --> 2:10:40.820
 it makes perfect sense, it must work.

2:10:40.820 --> 2:10:42.340
 I gave it to the patient, they got better,

2:10:42.340 --> 2:10:44.920
 and that's happened 20 times in the last year,

2:10:44.920 --> 2:10:46.700
 but it's, you know, I'm wrong.

2:10:46.700 --> 2:10:48.360
 Like when you actually do a study,

2:10:48.360 --> 2:10:51.180
 it actually doesn't help, maybe it hurts.

2:10:51.180 --> 2:10:55.340
 And that's really, I think the way we explain medications

2:10:55.340 --> 2:10:57.980
 working in our minds is often wrong

2:10:57.980 --> 2:11:01.100
 when you end up finally doing the study.

2:11:01.100 --> 2:11:03.780
 And some of the most interesting experiments

2:11:03.780 --> 2:11:06.020
 involve what we call sham surgery.

2:11:06.020 --> 2:11:08.380
 So for instance, people who injure their knee,

2:11:08.380 --> 2:11:10.740
 you know, arthroscopy where an orthopedic surgeon

2:11:10.740 --> 2:11:13.820
 goes in there with a scope, gets bits of bone out,

2:11:13.820 --> 2:11:17.060
 shaves down the cartilage, you know, cleans things up,

2:11:17.060 --> 2:11:18.140
 and it helps some people,

2:11:18.140 --> 2:11:21.560
 but they actually did some studies where one group of people

2:11:21.560 --> 2:11:24.620
 got the true arthroscopy and others just got sham surgery

2:11:24.620 --> 2:11:26.100
 where they put them to sleep,

2:11:26.100 --> 2:11:29.340
 made little cuts in the skin so they woke up with scars.

2:11:29.340 --> 2:11:31.700
 And then it turned out that it's not clear

2:11:31.700 --> 2:11:33.580
 arthroscopy is actually helping.

2:11:33.580 --> 2:11:37.260
 And the same, there was a recent huge study

2:11:37.260 --> 2:11:40.540
 of putting a stent in someone's coronary arteries

2:11:40.540 --> 2:11:41.900
 if they have stable chest pain,

2:11:41.900 --> 2:11:43.260
 not like I'm having a heart attack,

2:11:43.260 --> 2:11:44.940
 you need a stent like right then,

2:11:44.940 --> 2:11:48.040
 but, you know, kind of chronic coronary artery disease

2:11:48.040 --> 2:11:50.100
 where every time I run up the stairs, I get chest pain,

2:11:50.100 --> 2:11:52.580
 and then when I rest, it goes away.

2:11:52.580 --> 2:11:54.620
 Like obviously you put a stent,

2:11:54.620 --> 2:11:56.240
 you increase blood flow to the heart,

2:11:56.240 --> 2:11:57.520
 like how could that not work?

2:11:57.520 --> 2:12:00.340
 But then when they did the sham catheterization,

2:12:00.340 --> 2:12:02.980
 it actually looks like it might not actually help

2:12:02.980 --> 2:12:04.720
 better than the sham.

2:12:04.720 --> 2:12:07.300
 So I think those placebo controlled studies are essential.

2:12:07.300 --> 2:12:09.140
 I mean, it is shocking,

2:12:09.140 --> 2:12:12.080
 and this has been driven home during the last two years,

2:12:12.080 --> 2:12:13.540
 how hard it is to figure out

2:12:13.540 --> 2:12:15.180
 what the hell's going on in the universe,

2:12:15.180 --> 2:12:16.700
 especially with our bodies.

2:12:16.700 --> 2:12:18.860
 Like it is really hard to get at the truth

2:12:18.860 --> 2:12:21.680
 and what you think makes sense, like often turns out,

2:12:21.680 --> 2:12:23.260
 I mean, the history of modern medicine

2:12:23.260 --> 2:12:26.220
 is littered with examples where it made perfect sense

2:12:26.220 --> 2:12:27.740
 and it seemed to help some patients,

2:12:27.740 --> 2:12:31.300
 and it turns out it's not doing anything or it's harmful.

2:12:31.300 --> 2:12:33.340
 Yeah, there's all kinds of narratives swimming around.

2:12:33.340 --> 2:12:36.300
 We convince ourselves as a human civilization

2:12:36.300 --> 2:12:37.740
 that something is true.

2:12:37.740 --> 2:12:41.500
 There's a propaganda machines, there's just self delusion.

2:12:41.500 --> 2:12:45.380
 There's a centralized communities,

2:12:45.380 --> 2:12:47.040
 like there's a scientific community

2:12:47.040 --> 2:12:48.060
 that believes a certain thing.

2:12:48.060 --> 2:12:49.280
 There's the conspiracy theories

2:12:49.280 --> 2:12:51.320
 that believe a certain thing.

2:12:51.320 --> 2:12:52.940
 Sometimes the scientific community, right?

2:12:52.940 --> 2:12:56.300
 Sometimes the conspiracy theorists are right

2:12:56.300 --> 2:12:57.580
 throughout human history, I mean.

2:12:57.580 --> 2:13:00.300
 And we now think the scientific community,

2:13:00.300 --> 2:13:02.740
 well, now the science has really figured it out.

2:13:02.740 --> 2:13:04.780
 We're way smarter than we were in the past.

2:13:04.780 --> 2:13:07.020
 And then there's these like interesting studies

2:13:08.260 --> 2:13:11.500
 that I've seen, I think Robin Hansen mentioned it to me,

2:13:12.500 --> 2:13:16.760
 that if you look at the entirety of medication,

2:13:16.760 --> 2:13:19.340
 like the effect of medication on human health,

2:13:19.340 --> 2:13:21.900
 if you do those kinds of broad studies,

2:13:21.900 --> 2:13:23.500
 does it actually help?

2:13:24.460 --> 2:13:26.940
 Like does quality of life,

2:13:26.940 --> 2:13:29.480
 lifespan, certain measures of the wellbeing,

2:13:30.340 --> 2:13:34.100
 does if you, and you look at human society as a whole,

2:13:34.100 --> 2:13:37.380
 does taking medication or not actually help?

2:13:37.380 --> 2:13:39.860
 And those studies find there's no positive

2:13:39.860 --> 2:13:42.020
 or negative effect with medication.

2:13:42.020 --> 2:13:46.680
 And that's a very kind of interesting perspective.

2:13:46.680 --> 2:13:51.460
 That mean you could probably argue a lot of ways,

2:13:51.460 --> 2:13:55.340
 but the point is, because you can bring up

2:13:56.740 --> 2:13:58.980
 literally a billion cases where medication

2:13:58.980 --> 2:14:01.940
 has significant positive impact on a particular patient,

2:14:01.940 --> 2:14:03.960
 but you have to kind of zoom out

2:14:03.960 --> 2:14:08.020
 and honestly look at the positive effects of medicine,

2:14:08.020 --> 2:14:12.540
 of lifestyle choices, diet choices, of exercise or not.

2:14:12.540 --> 2:14:13.740
 Maybe we'll find eventually

2:14:13.740 --> 2:14:15.740
 that exercise is actually bad for you.

2:14:15.740 --> 2:14:20.060
 Maybe like there's all kinds of things

2:14:20.060 --> 2:14:24.180
 that we're going to, I feel like we're going to figure out.

2:14:24.180 --> 2:14:26.860
 One of the things I think we're going to figure out,

2:14:26.860 --> 2:14:29.180
 everything I've learned about my body,

2:14:30.660 --> 2:14:34.600
 is that aside from it being adaptable,

2:14:34.600 --> 2:14:37.260
 there's a lot of very unique parameters

2:14:37.260 --> 2:14:39.740
 that are opaque to me that I'm measuring

2:14:39.740 --> 2:14:41.140
 through this feedback mechanism

2:14:41.140 --> 2:14:43.460
 by trying stuff and learning about it.

2:14:43.460 --> 2:14:46.580
 And one of the things we might learn

2:14:46.580 --> 2:14:50.440
 is that medicine cannot be done without collecting

2:14:50.440 --> 2:14:53.360
 a huge amount of data about each individual human.

2:14:53.360 --> 2:14:58.360
 So it's absurd to be, like if I show up and see a doctor,

2:14:59.540 --> 2:15:00.660
 it's absurd for that doctor

2:15:00.660 --> 2:15:03.100
 to have just a couple of minutes with me.

2:15:03.100 --> 2:15:07.500
 Like just looking at basic symptoms,

2:15:07.500 --> 2:15:12.500
 looking at such crappy data.

2:15:12.500 --> 2:15:17.500
 Like first of all, no long term data,

2:15:17.620 --> 2:15:20.980
 no longitudinal data, no historical data,

2:15:20.980 --> 2:15:25.460
 no detailed analysis of all the possible things.

2:15:25.460 --> 2:15:27.500
 Not just the related to your symptoms,

2:15:27.500 --> 2:15:30.980
 but related to other things that you're not complaining about.

2:15:30.980 --> 2:15:33.140
 Just giving you a full picture of the data

2:15:33.140 --> 2:15:37.300
 and then using AI to help the human doctor

2:15:37.300 --> 2:15:39.900
 highlight the things that you should perhaps

2:15:39.900 --> 2:15:41.540
 pay extra attention to.

2:15:41.540 --> 2:15:44.380
 I think we'll look back at this time as ridiculous

2:15:44.380 --> 2:15:47.460
 that doctors were expected to help anybody whatsoever

2:15:47.460 --> 2:15:49.100
 without having the data,

2:15:49.100 --> 2:15:52.380
 without having a huge amount of data about the human body.

2:15:52.380 --> 2:15:55.580
 Like you have to do so much with so little data.

2:15:55.580 --> 2:15:57.300
 It's very 19th century.

2:15:57.300 --> 2:15:58.580
 It's very 19th century.

2:15:58.580 --> 2:16:00.900
 So it relies on the brilliance of doctors

2:16:00.900 --> 2:16:02.980
 and of course the intuition,

2:16:02.980 --> 2:16:05.100
 the instinct you build up over time.

2:16:05.100 --> 2:16:06.660
 And that's quite powerful.

2:16:06.660 --> 2:16:09.500
 The human brain is pretty damn good

2:16:09.500 --> 2:16:11.140
 for using experience to teach you

2:16:11.140 --> 2:16:12.180
 how to make a good decision.

2:16:12.180 --> 2:16:16.740
 But still it's, you might as well be bloodletting.

2:16:16.740 --> 2:16:21.460
 Like it's humbling to think about that.

2:16:21.460 --> 2:16:22.420
 It's humbling.

2:16:22.420 --> 2:16:24.060
 It is humbling and it's important.

2:16:24.060 --> 2:16:28.900
 I think doctors sometimes lose that humble perspective

2:16:28.900 --> 2:16:30.020
 on what they do.

2:16:30.020 --> 2:16:31.860
 And I think it's very important

2:16:31.860 --> 2:16:34.060
 because as I said, medical history is just,

2:16:34.060 --> 2:16:36.620
 medical dogma has been tossed into the trash bin

2:16:36.620 --> 2:16:37.900
 so many times.

2:16:37.900 --> 2:16:40.860
 Something doctors were sure of was the case is not.

2:16:40.860 --> 2:16:44.380
 And it's important to be cognizant of that.

2:16:46.660 --> 2:16:51.660
 You tweeted about somebody that had a big impact

2:16:52.220 --> 2:16:55.260
 just by reading about him on my life as well.

2:16:56.140 --> 2:16:57.340
 Still think about him.

2:16:58.180 --> 2:17:00.420
 Rest in peace, Dr. Paul Farmer.

2:17:00.420 --> 2:17:01.860
 A big inspiration to me.

2:17:01.860 --> 2:17:04.100
 His medical career was a testament

2:17:04.100 --> 2:17:07.300
 to what one person can do to improve the world.

2:17:07.300 --> 2:17:09.500
 So who was Paul Farmer?

2:17:09.500 --> 2:17:12.140
 And what made him a great doctor and a great man

2:17:12.140 --> 2:17:15.540
 and somebody who was an inspiration to you?

2:17:15.540 --> 2:17:19.740
 So Paul Farmer was a kind of pioneer of global health.

2:17:19.740 --> 2:17:23.020
 He started Partners in Health,

2:17:23.020 --> 2:17:25.660
 which is kind of an international health organization

2:17:25.660 --> 2:17:28.140
 that operates originally in Haiti,

2:17:28.140 --> 2:17:30.580
 also Rwanda and elsewhere.

2:17:30.580 --> 2:17:34.260
 And I think he was just so a zealot

2:17:34.260 --> 2:17:37.820
 for getting healthcare to some of the poorest people

2:17:37.820 --> 2:17:38.780
 in the world.

2:17:38.780 --> 2:17:41.260
 And I remember reading some of his books

2:17:41.260 --> 2:17:43.020
 and a book about him by Tracy Kidder

2:17:43.020 --> 2:17:45.820
 that's really great, Mountains Beyond Mountains,

2:17:45.820 --> 2:17:47.780
 about how even when he was a medical student,

2:17:47.780 --> 2:17:50.660
 he was flying back and forth to Haiti in between exams

2:17:50.660 --> 2:17:55.620
 and just with this really intense focus and interest

2:17:55.620 --> 2:17:58.500
 in getting healthcare to where it's not.

2:17:58.500 --> 2:18:00.500
 And I think traveling around the world,

2:18:00.500 --> 2:18:05.220
 especially to poor places like India, Calcutta, Nepal,

2:18:05.220 --> 2:18:07.900
 you really see how unevenly the benefits

2:18:07.900 --> 2:18:09.220
 of modern medicine are spread

2:18:09.220 --> 2:18:10.220
 over the surface of the earth.

2:18:10.220 --> 2:18:11.220
 Not only if you're,

2:18:11.220 --> 2:18:13.540
 cause if you're in Antarctica and have a heart attack,

2:18:13.540 --> 2:18:14.940
 you're in serious trouble,

2:18:14.940 --> 2:18:18.940
 but just medications that cost pennies a day

2:18:19.820 --> 2:18:21.420
 can help people.

2:18:21.420 --> 2:18:25.340
 A lot of children in India under five die of diarrhea

2:18:25.340 --> 2:18:27.660
 and all they need is oral rehydration solutions

2:18:27.660 --> 2:18:30.100
 to stay hydrated.

2:18:30.100 --> 2:18:32.460
 Most of them can't afford IV fluids, for instance,

2:18:32.460 --> 2:18:33.540
 to get admitted to the hospital.

2:18:33.540 --> 2:18:37.100
 And really dehydration just kills hundreds of thousands

2:18:37.100 --> 2:18:38.860
 of kids throughout the world.

2:18:38.860 --> 2:18:42.900
 Not to mention bacterial pneumonia also is a major cause

2:18:42.900 --> 2:18:44.660
 of death in children under five.

2:18:44.660 --> 2:18:48.060
 And many of them, not all, would be saved by amoxicillin,

2:18:48.060 --> 2:18:49.260
 which is just pennies.

2:18:50.340 --> 2:18:54.180
 And I, for me, I took a, had a path

2:18:54.180 --> 2:18:56.420
 and I wanted to have a career in global health.

2:18:56.420 --> 2:18:59.060
 And I started traveling abroad to India and elsewhere

2:18:59.060 --> 2:19:01.780
 when I was a medical student and continued doing that.

2:19:01.780 --> 2:19:03.540
 Paul Farmer was sort of one of the first

2:19:03.540 --> 2:19:05.820
 to kind of open everyone's eyes, I think,

2:19:05.820 --> 2:19:09.540
 about the good you can do with just money

2:19:09.540 --> 2:19:12.340
 that we would, you know, change that we would throw away,

2:19:12.340 --> 2:19:14.100
 just, you know, put in a person, forget it,

2:19:14.100 --> 2:19:16.820
 or wherever we accumulate change these days.

2:19:16.820 --> 2:19:18.700
 So that's very eye opening.

2:19:18.700 --> 2:19:21.660
 And while medical science advances and that's good,

2:19:21.660 --> 2:19:23.020
 you know, we shouldn't forget

2:19:23.020 --> 2:19:25.140
 that 100 year old treatments could save lives

2:19:25.140 --> 2:19:27.540
 in parts of the world where they're just not available.

2:19:27.540 --> 2:19:30.940
 People should definitely read Mountains Beyond Mountains.

2:19:30.940 --> 2:19:35.700
 Just, for me at least, sort of a person from outside

2:19:35.700 --> 2:19:39.860
 all of it, it was the first person to make me realize

2:19:39.860 --> 2:19:43.660
 how difficult and the amount of humanity

2:19:43.660 --> 2:19:45.420
 that's involved in being a doctor.

2:19:46.380 --> 2:19:50.180
 So it's not some kind of cold economics based argument

2:19:50.180 --> 2:19:52.780
 about where to send treatments and so on.

2:19:52.780 --> 2:19:55.860
 That is there too, like you said,

2:19:55.860 --> 2:19:59.300
 basic treatments can help hundreds of thousands,

2:19:59.300 --> 2:20:02.060
 millions of people in many parts of the world.

2:20:02.060 --> 2:20:07.060
 But it's also when you have a patient in front of you,

2:20:08.700 --> 2:20:11.500
 there's some aspect of you that's willing to give

2:20:11.500 --> 2:20:13.420
 a lot of your time, a lot of your money,

2:20:13.420 --> 2:20:16.900
 a lot of your effort to saving them,

2:20:16.900 --> 2:20:18.940
 even though it doesn't make any sense.

2:20:20.300 --> 2:20:23.820
 It's irrational in some sense, but it's also human.

2:20:23.820 --> 2:20:25.500
 And that's the struggle of every doctor.

2:20:25.500 --> 2:20:27.940
 Like when you have to choose how to allocate your time,

2:20:27.940 --> 2:20:30.620
 how to allocate your mental energy.

2:20:30.620 --> 2:20:34.180
 It's a tough choice that a doctor has to make

2:20:34.180 --> 2:20:35.340
 and it's a human choice.

2:20:35.340 --> 2:20:39.660
 It's not some kind of cold game theoretic choice.

2:20:39.660 --> 2:20:42.820
 It's also a human choice and it can be irrational

2:20:42.820 --> 2:20:44.300
 in some sense.

2:20:44.300 --> 2:20:45.900
 People are asking you for help.

2:20:45.900 --> 2:20:48.340
 That's basically what every patient interaction is.

2:20:48.340 --> 2:20:49.620
 Someone's asking you for help.

2:20:49.620 --> 2:20:52.140
 So your inclination is to help them.

2:20:52.140 --> 2:20:54.340
 And even if it means going above and beyond,

2:20:54.340 --> 2:20:57.780
 I mean, a lot of factors affect how compassionate

2:20:57.780 --> 2:21:02.660
 a doctor might be on any given day or point in their career,

2:21:02.660 --> 2:21:05.260
 their own stress and burnout, et cetera.

2:21:05.260 --> 2:21:06.740
 But it's someone asking you for help

2:21:06.740 --> 2:21:08.820
 and so you do what you can to help them.

2:21:11.380 --> 2:21:15.500
 You've done quite a lot of things in your life.

2:21:15.500 --> 2:21:18.100
 It's been an interesting journey.

2:21:18.100 --> 2:21:21.140
 Of course, there's a lot of story yet to be written.

2:21:21.140 --> 2:21:24.260
 But what advice would you give to young people today?

2:21:24.260 --> 2:21:28.260
 In high school, maybe undergrad, college,

2:21:28.260 --> 2:21:30.500
 starting out on that journey.

2:21:30.500 --> 2:21:34.900
 Maybe trying to pick majors, trying to pick jobs,

2:21:34.900 --> 2:21:38.620
 careers, dreams and goals they can pursue.

2:21:38.620 --> 2:21:40.820
 What advice would you give them to have a career

2:21:40.820 --> 2:21:43.420
 they can be proud of or to even have a life

2:21:43.420 --> 2:21:44.420
 they can be proud of?

2:21:45.500 --> 2:21:48.180
 Well, I think having passion,

2:21:48.180 --> 2:21:50.300
 which isn't always a voluntary thing.

2:21:50.300 --> 2:21:52.140
 You just have it or you don't perhaps.

2:21:52.140 --> 2:21:54.500
 But becoming passionate about something

2:21:54.500 --> 2:21:57.660
 and following it wherever it takes you,

2:21:57.660 --> 2:21:59.660
 I think is really important.

2:21:59.660 --> 2:22:01.820
 You know, when I finished college

2:22:01.820 --> 2:22:03.900
 and sort of went to Russia for the first time,

2:22:03.900 --> 2:22:06.740
 that was in some ways the beginning of my whole career

2:22:06.740 --> 2:22:09.140
 and passions in my life.

2:22:09.140 --> 2:22:11.700
 And I didn't know what I was going for,

2:22:11.700 --> 2:22:12.580
 what was gonna happen,

2:22:12.580 --> 2:22:14.140
 what kind of career it would turn into,

2:22:14.140 --> 2:22:16.020
 what kind of job would it help me get when I got back.

2:22:16.020 --> 2:22:17.740
 I wasn't thinking about any of that.

2:22:17.740 --> 2:22:20.460
 I mean, I'm very fortunate I got that opportunity.

2:22:20.460 --> 2:22:24.660
 I'm very fortunate to be able to go and see those places

2:22:24.660 --> 2:22:25.740
 and have my mind opened.

2:22:25.740 --> 2:22:29.380
 And I think that really just the fuel from that passion

2:22:29.380 --> 2:22:30.540
 that was created during that time

2:22:30.540 --> 2:22:32.740
 is still 20 years later going strong.

2:22:33.820 --> 2:22:35.020
 I'm partial to healthcare.

2:22:35.020 --> 2:22:36.660
 I love being a doctor.

2:22:36.660 --> 2:22:39.460
 I think it's the perfect combination

2:22:39.460 --> 2:22:41.660
 of kind of intellectual problem solving,

2:22:41.660 --> 2:22:44.660
 being a detective while also working with your hands.

2:22:44.660 --> 2:22:46.220
 You know, when you do procedures,

2:22:46.220 --> 2:22:49.220
 especially in the ER, it's sort of the perfect combination.

2:22:49.220 --> 2:22:51.700
 I'm not a surgeon, but I do use my hands quite a bit

2:22:54.100 --> 2:22:55.380
 for a variety of reasons.

2:22:55.380 --> 2:22:57.900
 And so I always loved working with my hands.

2:22:57.900 --> 2:23:00.780
 I loved crafts, especially prehistoric crafts

2:23:01.940 --> 2:23:03.420
 before medical school.

2:23:03.420 --> 2:23:06.060
 And I just love kind of problem solving,

2:23:06.060 --> 2:23:08.860
 getting clues, figuring out what's going on,

2:23:08.860 --> 2:23:12.340
 following your nose, using your instincts, your knowledge,

2:23:12.340 --> 2:23:15.020
 and also just keen observation of the patient.

2:23:15.020 --> 2:23:17.700
 After seeing patient after patient, hundreds of patients,

2:23:17.700 --> 2:23:20.780
 maybe thousands over years, you do get this sort of

2:23:20.780 --> 2:23:22.900
 innate kind of sense, this gestalt

2:23:22.900 --> 2:23:24.260
 about what might be going on.

2:23:24.260 --> 2:23:26.100
 And, you know, it's not always a numbers thing.

2:23:26.100 --> 2:23:26.940
 That's the thing.

2:23:26.940 --> 2:23:30.620
 There's always, gestalt is actually a big part of medicine.

2:23:30.620 --> 2:23:33.300
 You know, you often in ERs or in hospitals,

2:23:33.300 --> 2:23:35.860
 hear a nurse or a doctor say something like,

2:23:35.860 --> 2:23:37.940
 this patient just doesn't look good.

2:23:37.940 --> 2:23:40.820
 And it's sort of, you can't point to a number, a value,

2:23:40.820 --> 2:23:43.660
 a level in their blood, you know, a test,

2:23:43.660 --> 2:23:45.100
 but something about them.

2:23:45.100 --> 2:23:47.420
 And a lot of that I think has to do

2:23:47.420 --> 2:23:49.860
 with the color of their skin, believe it or not,

2:23:49.860 --> 2:23:52.980
 which can change in certain disease states.

2:23:52.980 --> 2:23:56.220
 But I think that it's just,

2:23:56.220 --> 2:23:59.700
 medicine combines this observation, the skills,

2:23:59.700 --> 2:24:02.980
 the knowledge, it's art and science, it's human,

2:24:02.980 --> 2:24:06.900
 and it's robotic, you know, algorithmic at the same time.

2:24:06.900 --> 2:24:10.020
 And I think it just, yeah, combines kind of

2:24:10.020 --> 2:24:11.700
 all my passions all in one.

2:24:11.700 --> 2:24:14.060
 And I would, you know, if anyone's going into healthcare,

2:24:14.060 --> 2:24:16.380
 I'd strongly encourage them to do so, but I'm very biased.

2:24:16.380 --> 2:24:19.620
 So with that early passion, whatever that little flame was

2:24:19.620 --> 2:24:24.620
 that brought you to Russia, were you able to vocalize it

2:24:24.980 --> 2:24:27.140
 or was it just something like a gut

2:24:27.140 --> 2:24:30.740
 that's pulled you towards some exploration

2:24:30.740 --> 2:24:33.020
 of the unknown or something like this?

2:24:33.020 --> 2:24:34.860
 I think it was a combination of things.

2:24:34.860 --> 2:24:36.920
 One was just going to a different place

2:24:36.920 --> 2:24:39.920
 that was different from where I grew up, you know.

2:24:39.920 --> 2:24:42.140
 The suburbs, you know, when you're in high school,

2:24:42.140 --> 2:24:44.220
 you hate them, later on they don't seem so bad.

2:24:44.220 --> 2:24:45.940
 But, you know, I just wanted to get,

2:24:45.940 --> 2:24:48.220
 I mean, I'm very fortunate how I was raised

2:24:48.220 --> 2:24:51.520
 and never wanted for anything that wasn't rich,

2:24:51.520 --> 2:24:54.500
 but just to get out and see a different place,

2:24:54.500 --> 2:24:56.540
 a different people with a different culture

2:24:56.540 --> 2:24:58.540
 and history and language and literature

2:24:58.540 --> 2:25:00.700
 and to see different climates and geographies

2:25:00.700 --> 2:25:03.560
 and ecosystems, I just wanted to see something different.

2:25:03.560 --> 2:25:07.360
 And that, I guess that's what I've sought after ever since.

2:25:07.360 --> 2:25:09.580
 So just that was just so fascinating.

2:25:09.580 --> 2:25:12.460
 Like my trip to Kamchatka in 2003,

2:25:12.460 --> 2:25:14.100
 where I was there for four months

2:25:14.100 --> 2:25:16.180
 and I didn't speak English for, I think,

2:25:16.180 --> 2:25:17.700
 two months out of it.

2:25:17.700 --> 2:25:20.380
 And just, I remember lying on the floor,

2:25:20.380 --> 2:25:22.260
 some wooden floor in a hunter's cabin

2:25:22.260 --> 2:25:23.700
 in the middle of Northern Kamchatka,

2:25:23.700 --> 2:25:26.180
 just being like, what am I doing here?

2:25:26.180 --> 2:25:28.780
 This is, I'm just so grateful for like the experiences

2:25:28.780 --> 2:25:32.020
 I was having, what I was seeing and realizing and learning.

2:25:32.020 --> 2:25:33.540
 It was just, I was so grateful,

2:25:33.540 --> 2:25:35.460
 even though I was lying on this hard, uncomfortable floor,

2:25:35.460 --> 2:25:37.600
 it's just like, this is so amazing.

2:25:37.600 --> 2:25:40.500
 And that, I don't think I'll ever have another travel

2:25:40.500 --> 2:25:41.980
 as meaningful and life changing

2:25:41.980 --> 2:25:44.480
 as that particular trip to Kamchatka was.

2:25:46.100 --> 2:25:47.620
 Though I'm still striving after it.

2:25:47.620 --> 2:25:51.260
 You never replicate that first high, but you always try.

2:25:51.260 --> 2:25:54.440
 So I just think that seeing something different

2:25:54.440 --> 2:25:56.080
 is kind of the game.

2:25:56.080 --> 2:25:57.940
 And there wasn't really a plan.

2:25:57.940 --> 2:26:02.140
 Cause I got a chance to talk to the CEO of Qualcomm recently

2:26:02.140 --> 2:26:07.140
 and his advice is, always have a plan.

2:26:07.140 --> 2:26:12.140
 And it sounds like you're saying don't have a plan.

2:26:13.900 --> 2:26:16.100
 Don't need to have a plan.

2:26:16.100 --> 2:26:19.580
 Just listen to your gut, your passion and follow that

2:26:19.580 --> 2:26:21.380
 and see where that takes you.

2:26:21.380 --> 2:26:23.260
 Cause it's telling you something.

2:26:23.260 --> 2:26:26.820
 Yeah, I think, I guess the plan could be specific

2:26:26.820 --> 2:26:29.580
 or it could be as general as I just wanna go far away

2:26:29.580 --> 2:26:32.260
 and see something very different, that's my plan.

2:26:32.260 --> 2:26:33.620
 And I did just one line.

2:26:33.620 --> 2:26:36.660
 Yeah, just followed my nose from one thing to the next,

2:26:36.660 --> 2:26:38.620
 just being interested, following my passion.

2:26:38.620 --> 2:26:41.500
 And again, very fortunate I could do that.

2:26:41.500 --> 2:26:45.820
 Are there places in the world you're kind of thinking

2:26:45.820 --> 2:26:49.620
 about that your life might take you at some point

2:26:52.760 --> 2:26:55.040
 to be a doctor there for a time,

2:26:55.040 --> 2:26:58.580
 to explore for a time that you haven't yet?

2:26:58.580 --> 2:27:01.620
 I have some colleagues who do kind of global health work

2:27:01.620 --> 2:27:05.740
 in various countries in Africa and Central and South America.

2:27:05.740 --> 2:27:09.940
 I would really love to go to some of those places,

2:27:09.940 --> 2:27:11.220
 not just for a short trip,

2:27:11.220 --> 2:27:13.620
 but hopefully for an extended period of time

2:27:14.520 --> 2:27:17.540
 with sort of the healthcare being the ticket in,

2:27:17.540 --> 2:27:20.580
 but then maybe even bringing my children or just,

2:27:20.580 --> 2:27:23.520
 I guess at this point, some of the travel I dream about

2:27:23.520 --> 2:27:25.080
 is sort of replicating what I did

2:27:25.080 --> 2:27:26.820
 and showing it to my kids in a way.

2:27:27.820 --> 2:27:29.540
 But there's still a lot I haven't seen

2:27:29.540 --> 2:27:30.980
 and would love to see as well.

2:27:30.980 --> 2:27:35.820
 But I think those opportunities sort of lend themselves well

2:27:35.820 --> 2:27:37.980
 as a doctor with kind of the ability to go there

2:27:37.980 --> 2:27:39.780
 and sort of help patients,

2:27:39.780 --> 2:27:42.580
 but also teach medical students and residents.

2:27:42.580 --> 2:27:45.460
 Teaching is actually a huge part of being a doctor

2:27:45.460 --> 2:27:47.080
 that's underappreciated,

2:27:47.080 --> 2:27:48.860
 but that's actually part of the fun of being a doctor

2:27:48.860 --> 2:27:50.100
 is that you're also a teacher.

2:27:50.100 --> 2:27:52.100
 Of course, the word doctor means teacher,

2:27:52.100 --> 2:27:54.400
 but it's come to mean something else.

2:27:55.260 --> 2:27:57.900
 But in some of my jobs,

2:27:57.900 --> 2:28:00.660
 I'm working alongside medical students and residents

2:28:00.660 --> 2:28:03.020
 and I'm giving them my knowledge, my wisdom,

2:28:03.020 --> 2:28:04.300
 sharing with them stories.

2:28:04.300 --> 2:28:06.860
 And so that's a very satisfying part of the job.

2:28:08.620 --> 2:28:10.860
 If we could take a brief step

2:28:10.860 --> 2:28:15.300
 into a dark place together for a time,

2:28:15.300 --> 2:28:20.300
 is there, what is a dark place you've gone in your mind

2:28:21.460 --> 2:28:22.540
 in your life?

2:28:22.540 --> 2:28:26.580
 What would be the darkest place you ever gone

2:28:26.580 --> 2:28:30.140
 for a time, for a moment?

2:28:32.580 --> 2:28:34.260
 And how did you survive?

2:28:34.260 --> 2:28:35.460
 How did you overcome it?

2:28:36.900 --> 2:28:39.340
 That's a very good question.

2:28:39.340 --> 2:28:44.340
 I would say I haven't had as dark moments

2:28:45.460 --> 2:28:49.580
 as many of the people who I care for in the emergency room.

2:28:49.580 --> 2:28:51.180
 I'm fortunate in that way.

2:28:51.180 --> 2:28:56.140
 I've had a pretty enjoyable, satisfying life.

2:28:56.140 --> 2:29:00.820
 I think everybody has dark moments though, including me.

2:29:00.820 --> 2:29:03.740
 One of the most shocking things I feel like

2:29:03.740 --> 2:29:07.100
 becoming an adult, my two big realizations have been,

2:29:07.100 --> 2:29:08.680
 one, no one knows what they're doing.

2:29:08.680 --> 2:29:12.260
 And two, suicide is incredibly common,

2:29:12.260 --> 2:29:14.400
 like in all humans and all societies.

2:29:14.400 --> 2:29:16.180
 That I just find shocking.

2:29:16.180 --> 2:29:18.540
 I mean, I've never seriously contemplated myself,

2:29:18.540 --> 2:29:20.940
 but I wouldn't say it hasn't crossed my mind

2:29:20.940 --> 2:29:24.500
 during some more stressful times of life.

2:29:24.500 --> 2:29:27.580
 I think it crosses everyone's mind.

2:29:27.580 --> 2:29:31.100
 And sort of as a kid, I found that I never would have guessed

2:29:31.100 --> 2:29:32.860
 how common suicide is.

2:29:32.860 --> 2:29:37.700
 It's an important question to sort of the Camus question,

2:29:37.700 --> 2:29:39.120
 like why live?

2:29:40.360 --> 2:29:41.720
 Why?

2:29:41.720 --> 2:29:42.820
 Why?

2:29:42.820 --> 2:29:46.180
 Because like life, especially when you're struggling,

2:29:46.180 --> 2:29:47.920
 especially when life is shit,

2:29:48.820 --> 2:29:51.340
 like why am I doing any of this?

2:29:51.340 --> 2:29:54.360
 And then on top of that, chemistry of your brain,

2:29:55.420 --> 2:29:58.580
 it could be as simple as diet and nutrition

2:29:58.580 --> 2:30:02.460
 and aforementioned exercise and things like this

2:30:02.460 --> 2:30:05.940
 that affect the chemistry such that you're more predisposed

2:30:05.940 --> 2:30:09.980
 to go to the places of asking the question why,

2:30:09.980 --> 2:30:14.560
 and maybe struggling to find a good answer.

2:30:14.560 --> 2:30:17.980
 Because it's actually a question with no good answer,

2:30:17.980 --> 2:30:21.460
 except something in your chemistry says,

2:30:21.460 --> 2:30:23.420
 well, I kind of like it.

2:30:23.420 --> 2:30:26.140
 But there's no good intellectual answer.

2:30:26.140 --> 2:30:29.000
 And especially if day to day, it's pain.

2:30:29.920 --> 2:30:33.580
 You get to see these stories of Robin Williams,

2:30:34.540 --> 2:30:36.440
 these people that are on top of the world

2:30:36.440 --> 2:30:38.100
 from an external perspective,

2:30:38.100 --> 2:30:42.880
 but from an internal perspective, it's struggle.

2:30:42.880 --> 2:30:46.180
 Every day is pain, feels hopeless,

2:30:46.180 --> 2:30:51.180
 and yeah, that's a question we all have to struggle with

2:30:51.700 --> 2:30:53.500
 or learn how to ignore.

2:30:53.500 --> 2:30:55.620
 Maybe because if you ask the question too much,

2:30:55.620 --> 2:30:59.180
 you're not going to find a good answer.

2:30:59.180 --> 2:31:00.380
 That's a choice you make.

2:31:00.380 --> 2:31:03.080
 I personally think you should ask that question a lot.

2:31:05.780 --> 2:31:08.940
 But maybe because I have the luxury of the chemistry I have

2:31:08.940 --> 2:31:13.940
 where I'm not in danger of seriously contemplating suicide.

2:31:13.940 --> 2:31:18.060
 But why live is an important question to answer constantly

2:31:18.060 --> 2:31:19.960
 and struggle to answer that constantly.

2:31:21.700 --> 2:31:25.940
 But people, I've been extremely fortunate

2:31:25.940 --> 2:31:29.500
 to meet people over the past couple of years

2:31:29.500 --> 2:31:30.800
 that are really struggling.

2:31:31.740 --> 2:31:36.740
 And you have probably met people

2:31:39.220 --> 2:31:42.380
 who are really struggling, like orders of magnitude

2:31:42.380 --> 2:31:45.220
 more people who are really struggling.

2:31:45.220 --> 2:31:48.580
 Some of it is psychological, a lot of it is biological.

2:31:49.460 --> 2:31:53.100
 And man, life is a motherfucker.

2:31:53.100 --> 2:31:54.060
 It's pretty tough.

2:31:54.060 --> 2:31:55.620
 Very true.

2:31:55.620 --> 2:31:59.280
 I do think also past trauma plays a big role there

2:31:59.280 --> 2:32:03.420
 like we talked about, war wounds and PTSD.

2:32:03.420 --> 2:32:06.940
 A lot of people grew up with just horrific childhoods.

2:32:06.940 --> 2:32:09.060
 They were abused in one way or another.

2:32:09.060 --> 2:32:12.740
 And I think a lot of people who have not,

2:32:12.740 --> 2:32:14.860
 I'm not saying a majority, but a lot of people,

2:32:14.860 --> 2:32:17.860
 for instance, who I see in the ER coming in

2:32:17.860 --> 2:32:20.780
 for threatening suicide or actually trying and failing

2:32:20.780 --> 2:32:22.220
 and being brought to the ER,

2:32:22.220 --> 2:32:26.540
 a lot of them just have really traumatic experiences,

2:32:26.540 --> 2:32:30.060
 saw their parent commit suicide, were abused.

2:32:30.060 --> 2:32:32.860
 These leave scars in the human brain and mind.

2:32:32.860 --> 2:32:35.940
 And a lot of their subsequent lives

2:32:35.940 --> 2:32:38.580
 of whether it's substance abuse, alcoholism, et cetera,

2:32:38.580 --> 2:32:40.700
 is almost trying to escape from their own memories.

2:32:40.700 --> 2:32:45.460
 And it's sort of such this overwhelming battle sometimes.

2:32:45.460 --> 2:32:48.780
 Like sometimes people get ruined, it seems,

2:32:48.780 --> 2:32:51.300
 and just can't be fixed, you know what I mean?

2:32:51.300 --> 2:32:54.620
 Yes, you can improve diet and health and your life choices

2:32:54.620 --> 2:32:57.540
 and seek out your passion and exercise.

2:32:57.540 --> 2:32:59.140
 And those definitely will help.

2:32:59.140 --> 2:33:00.820
 But sometimes just like, you know,

2:33:00.820 --> 2:33:02.180
 you bear the scars of the past

2:33:02.180 --> 2:33:04.260
 and there's no getting rid of them.

2:33:04.260 --> 2:33:08.860
 Yeah, I think it's possible to live with them.

2:33:08.860 --> 2:33:10.020
 I think so too. To the struggle.

2:33:10.020 --> 2:33:12.220
 I would never say give up, you know.

2:33:12.220 --> 2:33:13.740
 Keep fighting.

2:33:13.740 --> 2:33:15.740
 It is a constant, it can be a constant battle

2:33:15.740 --> 2:33:16.660
 for some people.

2:33:16.660 --> 2:33:20.340
 I know it can be, and I've talked to many of those folks,

2:33:20.340 --> 2:33:24.580
 I know it can feel hopeless, but keep up the good fight.

2:33:24.580 --> 2:33:26.260
 Hopelessness. Keep up the good fight.

2:33:26.260 --> 2:33:29.540
 Hopelessness is kind of one of the big suicide risk factors

2:33:29.540 --> 2:33:32.380
 that you sort of ask about as a doctor, you know,

2:33:32.380 --> 2:33:37.220
 do you feel hopeless? And that sort of can be a harbinger.

2:33:37.220 --> 2:33:39.700
 I have quite a few dark moments.

2:33:39.700 --> 2:33:44.700
 So if you're listening and you're struggling,

2:33:44.900 --> 2:33:47.500
 we're in this together, brother and sister,

2:33:47.500 --> 2:33:48.740
 keep up the good fight.

2:33:51.060 --> 2:33:52.820
 Life is a motherfucker, as you said.

2:33:52.820 --> 2:33:55.060
 It's really harder.

2:33:55.060 --> 2:33:57.940
 I think as a kid, you know, in a joy free childhood,

2:33:57.940 --> 2:34:00.140
 you don't realize, like, obviously there's a ton

2:34:00.140 --> 2:34:02.020
 you don't realize about life,

2:34:02.020 --> 2:34:03.380
 but then when you get to be an adult,

2:34:03.380 --> 2:34:07.140
 you realize just how complex and hard it is.

2:34:07.140 --> 2:34:08.860
 Is it this hard for adult animals?

2:34:08.860 --> 2:34:10.660
 I don't know. I don't think it is.

2:34:13.060 --> 2:34:18.060
 So I haven't seen the honesty of biology before you.

2:34:18.940 --> 2:34:21.580
 Do you think about your own death?

2:34:22.700 --> 2:34:25.300
 Do you contemplate death?

2:34:25.300 --> 2:34:26.860
 Are you afraid of your own death?

2:34:26.860 --> 2:34:28.220
 How do you make sense of it?

2:34:29.780 --> 2:34:31.700
 I've definitely thought about it,

2:34:31.700 --> 2:34:34.340
 especially maybe while doing certain risky things,

2:34:35.420 --> 2:34:37.940
 ice climbing and others where every time I looked down,

2:34:37.940 --> 2:34:39.020
 I thought about my own death.

2:34:39.020 --> 2:34:41.820
 But I think, you know,

2:34:41.820 --> 2:34:45.220
 I think having kids changes the equation for sure,

2:34:46.860 --> 2:34:48.620
 should change the equation perhaps.

2:34:48.620 --> 2:34:50.660
 So I think a lot of,

2:34:50.660 --> 2:34:53.300
 now when I think about what will happen when I die,

2:34:53.300 --> 2:34:56.260
 you know, there's a lot of worrying about

2:34:56.260 --> 2:34:58.340
 what will happen to the people I care for.

2:34:58.340 --> 2:35:00.940
 You know, you think about things like insurance policy,

2:35:00.940 --> 2:35:04.980
 life insurance and, you know, disability insurance,

2:35:04.980 --> 2:35:07.260
 that's not related to death, but more just injuries.

2:35:07.260 --> 2:35:09.900
 And that's part of the weight, I guess,

2:35:09.900 --> 2:35:13.380
 that you feel as an adult,

2:35:13.380 --> 2:35:16.540
 that I think grows rapidly when you have kids.

2:35:16.540 --> 2:35:17.420
 Though not only, you know,

2:35:17.420 --> 2:35:19.020
 there's other people you can care for,

2:35:19.020 --> 2:35:20.860
 your own parents and loved ones.

2:35:20.860 --> 2:35:23.740
 Like a lot of people depend on individuals.

2:35:23.740 --> 2:35:25.380
 And so you think about what will happen

2:35:25.380 --> 2:35:27.740
 to the other people when you die.

2:35:27.740 --> 2:35:31.780
 But also, to push back, that weight

2:35:31.780 --> 2:35:35.660
 might be something you've convinced yourself to think about.

2:35:35.660 --> 2:35:37.660
 It's an important weight to think about.

2:35:37.660 --> 2:35:42.660
 But you focus on that weight to escape the other weight,

2:35:43.300 --> 2:35:47.300
 which is, at one point,

2:35:48.460 --> 2:35:51.580
 this consciousness just comes to an end.

2:35:51.580 --> 2:35:54.580
 And it's hard to make sense of that.

2:35:54.580 --> 2:35:56.380
 We kind of delude ourselves in thinking,

2:35:56.380 --> 2:35:58.100
 okay, it just, yeah, it ends.

2:35:58.100 --> 2:35:59.900
 That's the natural way of things and so on.

2:35:59.900 --> 2:36:01.220
 That makes sense, so we're good.

2:36:01.220 --> 2:36:03.700
 Okay, that's the way of life.

2:36:03.700 --> 2:36:07.580
 But I don't think it's cognitively easy

2:36:07.580 --> 2:36:12.260
 to just realize how terrifying that is.

2:36:12.260 --> 2:36:17.260
 We love life so much that the end of it,

2:36:18.500 --> 2:36:23.500
 it just, it's something that makes no sense.

2:36:24.780 --> 2:36:26.300
 And if you linger on that thought,

2:36:26.300 --> 2:36:31.300
 I think it's a painful, I would say even terrifying thought.

2:36:31.460 --> 2:36:34.300
 Not scared of like, in a way that's

2:36:34.300 --> 2:36:36.660
 almost like philosophically terrifying.

2:36:36.660 --> 2:36:39.540
 Like, it just reminds you, maybe humbles you

2:36:39.540 --> 2:36:42.520
 that you don't know anything about anything.

2:36:44.340 --> 2:36:47.020
 But one of the things we do as humans really well

2:36:47.020 --> 2:36:50.620
 is we, especially with kids, you realize,

2:36:50.620 --> 2:36:53.500
 okay, we start caring for others in the community,

2:36:53.500 --> 2:36:56.260
 in the family, and so on, and that distracts us.

2:36:56.260 --> 2:36:58.540
 So then we can at least focus on other people's problems

2:36:58.540 --> 2:36:59.900
 and not deal with our own.

2:37:02.860 --> 2:37:05.180
 When I was a medical student, I was particularly

2:37:05.180 --> 2:37:07.700
 fascinated with kind of what actually happens

2:37:07.700 --> 2:37:10.820
 as people die, like in the last minute, seconds of life.

2:37:10.820 --> 2:37:12.220
 It's sort of surprising sometimes,

2:37:12.220 --> 2:37:13.820
 like what actually kills people.

2:37:13.820 --> 2:37:17.160
 You know, like you can get, let's say, a bad head injury

2:37:17.160 --> 2:37:18.880
 and you know, what kills you.

2:37:18.880 --> 2:37:22.260
 Sometimes it's just your consciousness decreases

2:37:22.260 --> 2:37:26.900
 and you become kind of comatose, you aspirate,

2:37:26.900 --> 2:37:28.980
 your oxygen plummets, and you get cardiac arrest.

2:37:28.980 --> 2:37:31.500
 You know, that kind of sequence of events.

2:37:31.500 --> 2:37:34.700
 Or, you know, a heroin overdose,

2:37:34.700 --> 2:37:36.080
 let's say you stop breathing.

2:37:36.080 --> 2:37:37.620
 Similarly, your oxygen goes down,

2:37:37.620 --> 2:37:38.580
 then you get a cardiac arrest.

2:37:38.580 --> 2:37:41.380
 So I was really fascinated with what actually happens,

2:37:41.380 --> 2:37:43.380
 what makes people die.

2:37:43.380 --> 2:37:45.940
 And it was sort of a morbid fascination, obviously,

2:37:45.940 --> 2:37:47.740
 like most of med school is.

2:37:47.740 --> 2:37:52.280
 And I had many instances where I've had patients pass

2:37:52.280 --> 2:37:55.600
 and as a medical student, I was sort of learning

2:37:55.600 --> 2:37:57.540
 what's actually happening, watching it happen

2:37:57.540 --> 2:37:59.980
 and not always being able to prevent it.

2:37:59.980 --> 2:38:03.240
 It was sort of a scientific exploration.

2:38:03.240 --> 2:38:06.220
 Then the patient's family comes in and are just devastated.

2:38:06.220 --> 2:38:08.580
 And then it's like, rips you out

2:38:08.580 --> 2:38:10.060
 of this scientific perspective

2:38:10.060 --> 2:38:12.620
 and you just realize how horrible death is,

2:38:12.620 --> 2:38:14.180
 but the person's fine.

2:38:14.180 --> 2:38:15.540
 You know, it's the family, I guess.

2:38:15.540 --> 2:38:18.780
 And that's why it's always, I guess that pointed out

2:38:18.780 --> 2:38:20.740
 just how what people leave behind

2:38:20.740 --> 2:38:22.940
 is often kind of the horribleness of death.

2:38:22.940 --> 2:38:25.200
 Like just becoming unconscious and staying that way

2:38:25.200 --> 2:38:28.140
 doesn't seem, I guess to me personally, so bad.

2:38:28.140 --> 2:38:30.920
 Sort of like going to sleep, not waking up,

2:38:30.920 --> 2:38:33.140
 not counting the pain and stuff that precedes it.

2:38:33.140 --> 2:38:35.420
 So the actual pain, the actual suffering

2:38:35.420 --> 2:38:39.300
 is often felt by the people who love the person who died.

2:38:39.300 --> 2:38:43.980
 So both financial pain, psychological pain,

2:38:43.980 --> 2:38:46.820
 for years missing them, all those kinds of things.

2:38:46.820 --> 2:38:50.020
 Right, never forgetting the anniversary of their death.

2:38:50.020 --> 2:38:54.180
 You know, just having flashbacks or something reminding you.

2:38:54.180 --> 2:38:57.780
 That sort of brought home to me sort of what death means.

2:38:57.780 --> 2:39:00.060
 And it was more about what people leave behind

2:39:00.060 --> 2:39:01.900
 than what happens to them specifically.

2:39:01.900 --> 2:39:04.260
 See, I like those concerns

2:39:04.260 --> 2:39:07.900
 because I feel like I can do a lot about those.

2:39:07.900 --> 2:39:09.180
 Those make sense to me.

2:39:09.180 --> 2:39:12.020
 Then just be, if you're a father, just be a good father.

2:39:12.020 --> 2:39:15.980
 If you're sort of, you mentioned sort of insurance.

2:39:15.980 --> 2:39:18.380
 Yeah, there's like financial stuff to take care of.

2:39:18.380 --> 2:39:19.900
 What I don't know what to do with

2:39:19.900 --> 2:39:24.900
 is the philosophical existential crisis

2:39:26.280 --> 2:39:28.980
 of the fact that this fricking thing ends.

2:39:28.980 --> 2:39:32.500
 It doesn't, I don't know how to deal

2:39:32.500 --> 2:39:35.560
 with the mystery that's beyond death.

2:39:35.560 --> 2:39:36.620
 Why are we here?

2:39:36.620 --> 2:39:38.020
 Why are we born at all?

2:39:38.020 --> 2:39:39.540
 What is consciousness?

2:39:39.540 --> 2:39:41.160
 And you just look at yourself.

2:39:41.160 --> 2:39:42.000
 What is this?

2:39:42.000 --> 2:39:44.100
 Why do I have the capacity to suffer?

2:39:45.800 --> 2:39:47.940
 Why, why, all these kinds of why questions

2:39:47.940 --> 2:39:49.140
 that don't have answers.

2:39:49.140 --> 2:39:51.640
 Speaking of which, let me ask you a why question.

2:39:52.540 --> 2:39:54.260
 The biggest ridiculous one.

2:39:54.260 --> 2:39:56.520
 What do you think is the meaning of life?

2:39:58.220 --> 2:40:01.780
 Having, with this book, studied the incredible,

2:40:01.780 --> 2:40:06.060
 beautiful biology of life, the components,

2:40:06.060 --> 2:40:09.880
 the engineering components that make up this human body.

2:40:09.880 --> 2:40:12.280
 But when you look at the entirety of it,

2:40:13.100 --> 2:40:15.160
 what is why?

2:40:15.160 --> 2:40:16.180
 Why are we here?

2:40:16.180 --> 2:40:17.960
 Sometimes, probably more often than not,

2:40:17.960 --> 2:40:20.280
 feel like the question of why is a trick

2:40:20.280 --> 2:40:21.640
 of the human brain.

2:40:21.640 --> 2:40:25.780
 And outside of our thoughts, there is no why.

2:40:25.780 --> 2:40:28.060
 Why is not something that's in the universe.

2:40:28.060 --> 2:40:30.460
 It's just this trick happening inside our brain.

2:40:31.720 --> 2:40:36.260
 So why is a game that the human brain plays on itself?

2:40:36.260 --> 2:40:40.980
 And then the reality of life doesn't have why's.

2:40:40.980 --> 2:40:42.980
 I do wonder if asking why

2:40:42.980 --> 2:40:44.940
 is sort of an evolutionary adaptation.

2:40:44.940 --> 2:40:48.980
 Like why, you know, maybe hunting, gathering.

2:40:48.980 --> 2:40:51.260
 Why does this plant grow there and not there?

2:40:51.260 --> 2:40:53.220
 Why do I see the same deer tracks

2:40:53.220 --> 2:40:55.540
 and by the same tree every three days?

2:40:55.540 --> 2:40:58.060
 Why, you know, why is this, why is that?

2:40:59.540 --> 2:41:03.460
 Why does this plant make me vomit and that plant doesn't?

2:41:03.460 --> 2:41:06.100
 I guess those why's are very practical

2:41:06.100 --> 2:41:08.260
 and oriented towards survival.

2:41:08.260 --> 2:41:11.540
 But then obviously, you know, we not only use why,

2:41:11.540 --> 2:41:13.780
 you know, we use it to maybe hunt better,

2:41:13.780 --> 2:41:15.320
 gather better, survive better,

2:41:15.320 --> 2:41:16.780
 but then we sort of extrapolate it

2:41:16.780 --> 2:41:20.260
 into these unanswerable questions, you know,

2:41:21.300 --> 2:41:23.900
 about why, like why does life exist?

2:41:23.900 --> 2:41:26.920
 And it's possible that they're not unanswerable

2:41:26.920 --> 2:41:30.100
 in the long arc of science and history.

2:41:30.100 --> 2:41:33.320
 It's we're just striving for the really difficult questions.

2:41:33.320 --> 2:41:36.340
 Right now, we just don't know much about anything

2:41:36.340 --> 2:41:37.840
 and so we're striving.

2:41:37.840 --> 2:41:41.300
 But there's a long, so most of human history,

2:41:41.300 --> 2:41:43.340
 you were asking why questions

2:41:43.340 --> 2:41:47.140
 for which we now have very precise answers,

2:41:47.140 --> 2:41:48.980
 including with biology and physics

2:41:48.980 --> 2:41:50.780
 and all those kinds of things.

2:41:50.780 --> 2:41:54.040
 And maybe the why's, this cutting edge of science,

2:41:54.040 --> 2:41:56.840
 of the explorer of the curiosity of the human mind.

2:41:57.880 --> 2:42:00.060
 Like man's search for meaning

2:42:00.060 --> 2:42:04.220
 is the sort of the ultimate driver of the why.

2:42:04.220 --> 2:42:07.920
 And it's almost like it could be an evolutionary adaptation

2:42:07.920 --> 2:42:11.380
 of asking exceptionally hard why questions

2:42:11.380 --> 2:42:13.640
 that will never get answered.

2:42:15.040 --> 2:42:17.500
 Like, so you should always have,

2:42:17.500 --> 2:42:20.540
 like it's like a queue, it's a stack of questions,

2:42:20.540 --> 2:42:23.140
 why questions, and that thing should never come

2:42:23.140 --> 2:42:26.260
 to the bottom, should always be striving.

2:42:26.260 --> 2:42:28.520
 And that's useful for humans to come up

2:42:28.520 --> 2:42:30.980
 with better and better ways of survival.

2:42:30.980 --> 2:42:34.100
 And maybe from in a bigger perspective

2:42:34.100 --> 2:42:37.140
 for the universe to figure out something about itself.

2:42:37.140 --> 2:42:39.820
 And it's just humans, just a useful tool for that.

2:42:40.860 --> 2:42:42.900
 Or life on Earth is a useful tool for that.

2:42:42.900 --> 2:42:45.940
 Well, John, this, you're,

2:42:47.580 --> 2:42:50.160
 for people who should know, you're from Philadelphia.

2:42:50.160 --> 2:42:52.900
 I'm from Philadelphia, so it's an honor

2:42:52.900 --> 2:42:54.820
 that you would travel all this way

2:42:54.820 --> 2:42:57.500
 from a place I love to the new place I love

2:42:57.500 --> 2:43:00.420
 and that you'll write this really incredible book

2:43:00.420 --> 2:43:04.140
 that celebrates the human body in the most honest of ways.

2:43:04.140 --> 2:43:05.700
 And thank you for everything you do,

2:43:05.700 --> 2:43:08.060
 for being a great educator, for being a great doctor,

2:43:08.060 --> 2:43:10.140
 for being a great person, and for spending

2:43:10.140 --> 2:43:11.980
 your really valuable time with me today.

2:43:11.980 --> 2:43:12.820
 Thank you, John.

2:43:12.820 --> 2:43:14.780
 Thanks for having me, Lex.

2:43:14.780 --> 2:43:16.300
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:43:16.300 --> 2:43:17.700
 with Jonathan Reisman.

2:43:17.700 --> 2:43:20.060

 And now, let me leave you with some words from Paul Farmer,

2:43:24.820 --> 2:43:27.800
 a doctor who has inspired both Jonathan and me

2:43:27.800 --> 2:43:29.500
 with the way he practiced medicine

2:43:29.500 --> 2:43:31.220
 and the way he lived his life.

2:43:32.440 --> 2:43:35.520
 The idea that some lives matter less

2:43:35.520 --> 2:43:38.880
 is the root of all that is wrong with the world.

2:43:38.880 --> 2:43:53.880
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
