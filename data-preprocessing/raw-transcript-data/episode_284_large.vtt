00:00.000 --> 00:04.200
 You can't have a permanent war without fiat.

00:04.200 --> 00:07.600
 And I also think there's a case to be made

00:07.600 --> 00:10.360
 that you can't really have fiat without war.

00:12.600 --> 00:15.520
 The following is a conversation with Safety Namus,

00:15.520 --> 00:17.880
 one of the central and most impactful economists,

00:17.880 --> 00:21.560
 philosophers, and educators in the world of Bitcoin.

00:21.560 --> 00:24.480
 He's an Austrian economist, an anarchist,

00:24.480 --> 00:27.000
 and the author of The Bitcoin Standard

00:27.000 --> 00:29.640
 and the new book, The Fiat Standard.

00:29.640 --> 00:33.760
 Safety does not mince words in his criticism of economists

00:33.760 --> 00:36.800
 and humans in general with whom he disagrees.

00:36.800 --> 00:39.000
 For example, Paul Krugman,

00:39.000 --> 00:41.560
 who is a neo Ecclidean economist

00:41.560 --> 00:43.620
 and a previous guest at this podcast.

00:44.600 --> 00:48.760
 Safety's opinions are strong and often controversial.

00:48.760 --> 00:50.760
 I do push back in this conversation,

00:50.760 --> 00:54.360
 playing devil's advocate or trying to steal man each side.

00:54.360 --> 00:57.960
 But as always, I do so in the service of exploring

00:57.960 --> 01:00.520
 the rich space of ideas that Safety has

01:00.520 --> 01:03.680
 about human nature and human civilization.

01:03.680 --> 01:06.720
 I trust the intelligence of you, the listener,

01:06.720 --> 01:09.160
 to come to your own conclusions.

01:09.160 --> 01:12.600
 That is the burden of being a free thinking human.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.820
 It is on each of us individually

01:14.820 --> 01:17.840
 to dive into this chaos of ideas.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.120
 And from that chaos,

01:19.120 --> 01:23.220
 discover long lasting universal wisdom to live by.

01:24.240 --> 01:26.120

01:29.480 --> 01:32.880
 And now, dear friends, here's Safety Amoose.

01:33.780 --> 01:35.720
 Let's start with a big question.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.600
 What is money?

01:37.600 --> 01:39.040
 And what is the role of money

01:39.040 --> 01:40.680
 in the history of human civilization?

01:40.680 --> 01:42.400
 Money is a medium of exchange.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.660
 The thing that defines money is that it is a good

01:44.660 --> 01:46.820
 that you don't buy for its own sake

01:46.820 --> 01:48.440
 because you wanna consume it itself

01:48.440 --> 01:50.840
 or because you want to employ it

01:50.840 --> 01:51.900
 in the production of other goods,

01:51.900 --> 01:53.440
 which is what capital goods are.

01:53.440 --> 01:55.840
 So we have consumption goods, we have capital goods.

01:55.840 --> 01:57.520
 Money is distinct from those two

01:57.520 --> 01:59.420
 because it is a good that is acquired

01:59.420 --> 02:01.920
 purely to be exchanged later on for other goods.

02:01.920 --> 02:05.160
 So it's not something that you acquire for its own sake,

02:05.160 --> 02:07.800
 you acquire it so that you can then later on exchange it.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.720
 And that's a market good.

02:09.720 --> 02:12.000
 That's a market good like all other goods.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.080
 You acquire food because you eat it,

02:14.080 --> 02:16.120
 you acquire a car to move you around,

02:16.120 --> 02:17.880
 you acquire money so that you can exchange it

02:17.880 --> 02:19.480
 for other goods.

02:19.480 --> 02:21.640
 And that's something that many people

02:21.640 --> 02:22.880
 have a hard time grasping,

02:22.880 --> 02:25.040
 of the concept of money as a market good.

02:25.040 --> 02:27.880
 But it is a market good, just like all others.

02:27.880 --> 02:31.440
 And the importance of it is that it allows us to trade.

02:31.440 --> 02:35.760
 It allows us to develop the division of labor,

02:35.760 --> 02:37.280
 which would not be possible

02:37.280 --> 02:39.920
 at any kind of sophisticated level without money.

02:39.920 --> 02:44.360
 So if we live in a small society of 10 people,

02:44.360 --> 02:46.540
 then think about all the things that we can make,

02:46.540 --> 02:49.040
 all the things that we can produce.

02:49.040 --> 02:51.780
 If we're only 10 people isolated from the world,

02:51.780 --> 02:53.520
 there's only very few things that we can make.

02:53.520 --> 02:56.680
 And therefore we can exchange those things directly

02:56.680 --> 02:57.900
 with one another.

02:57.900 --> 03:02.700
 But as, you know, if we get in contact with other societies

03:02.700 --> 03:04.160
 that have more people,

03:04.160 --> 03:06.660
 then the opportunities for specialization increase.

03:06.660 --> 03:07.760
 You know, if there's 10 people,

03:07.760 --> 03:10.880
 the only thing that you can make is the very basics

03:10.880 --> 03:12.120
 you need for your survival.

03:12.120 --> 03:15.700
 But if you're part of an economy of 10 million people,

03:15.700 --> 03:17.440
 there's much more room for specialization.

03:17.440 --> 03:19.820
 You can make a car, you can make a house,

03:19.820 --> 03:22.000
 that's very sophisticated.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.440
 And that relies on the division of labor.

03:24.440 --> 03:26.640
 That relies on you specializing

03:26.640 --> 03:28.960
 in doing one tiny little thing,

03:28.960 --> 03:30.760
 which is not what you consume.

03:30.760 --> 03:33.280
 You know, and you trade that thing

03:33.280 --> 03:34.680
 for all the things that you consume.

03:34.680 --> 03:37.600
 So as the economy becomes more sophisticated

03:37.600 --> 03:38.900
 and involves more people,

03:38.900 --> 03:41.240
 and currently we're all part of an economy

03:41.240 --> 03:43.680
 of almost 8 billion people,

03:43.680 --> 03:46.600
 each one of us produces one tiny little thing.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.960
 And they exchange that thing

03:48.960 --> 03:50.720
 for all the things that they want.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.400
 And so, because we specialize,

03:52.400 --> 03:53.600
 we become more productive

03:53.600 --> 03:55.480
 in doing the thing that we're good at.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.940
 So, you know, there's people out there who are engineers,

03:57.940 --> 04:00.000
 who are designing windshields in cars.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.660
 It's a very specialized thing.

04:01.660 --> 04:05.200
 They sell windshield design to Mercedes Benz.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.480
 And then from that, you know,

04:07.480 --> 04:09.600
 that windshield design is added on

04:09.600 --> 04:11.480
 to millions of cars around the world.

04:11.480 --> 04:14.240
 And from that, they're able to get enough money

04:14.240 --> 04:16.020
 to meet all of their needs.

04:16.020 --> 04:19.440
 So the division of labor is enhanced enormously with money,

04:19.440 --> 04:20.840
 because without money,

04:20.840 --> 04:23.680
 it's very difficult to be able to exchange

04:23.680 --> 04:24.800
 a large number of goods.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.300
 It's very difficult to have a sophisticated economy

04:27.300 --> 04:29.160
 with a large degree of specialization,

04:29.160 --> 04:33.560
 because it's very difficult to find people

04:33.560 --> 04:36.020
 who want the thing that you have

04:36.020 --> 04:37.760
 and have the thing that you want.

04:37.760 --> 04:40.640
 We call this the coincidence of wants.

04:40.640 --> 04:42.720
 And that's really the problem that money solves.

04:42.720 --> 04:46.720
 So you make apples and I make oranges.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.420
 I'd like to have some of your apples,

04:48.420 --> 04:50.080
 but you don't want my oranges.

04:50.080 --> 04:52.240
 And that's, we have a problem of coincidence of wants.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.080
 So what do I do?

04:53.080 --> 04:54.140
 You want bananas.

04:54.140 --> 04:56.280
 I need to find somebody who has bananas,

04:56.280 --> 04:58.240
 give them my oranges, take their bananas,

04:58.240 --> 05:00.900
 give you their bananas, and then I take the apples.

05:00.900 --> 05:03.440
 In that case, bananas are a medium of exchange.

05:03.440 --> 05:06.400
 So it's natural that a medium of exchange will evolve

05:06.400 --> 05:07.840
 and will emerge in an economy

05:07.840 --> 05:09.680
 as an economy becomes more sophisticated.

05:09.680 --> 05:12.940
 As we move beyond 10 people and 10 goods,

05:12.940 --> 05:15.780
 it's inevitable that we're going to come to a situation

05:15.780 --> 05:18.480
 where we have the problem of coincidence of wants.

05:18.480 --> 05:21.720
 And the way to solve that is to use a medium of exchange.

05:21.720 --> 05:22.560
 And it can be anything.

05:22.560 --> 05:25.960
 It can be a banana, it can be food stuff,

05:25.960 --> 05:28.240
 it can be any kind of good.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.920
 As long as I acquire the good

05:29.920 --> 05:32.580
 with the purpose of passing it on to you,

05:32.580 --> 05:35.280
 not for the purpose of me consuming it or using it,

05:35.280 --> 05:36.920
 then that's a medium of exchange.

05:36.920 --> 05:40.000
 So when we look at the entirety of human society

05:40.000 --> 05:42.600
 of millions of billions of people,

05:42.600 --> 05:46.480
 you think of them, just a bunch of individuals running around.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.520
 I love the term coincidence of wants.

05:49.520 --> 05:52.660
 So each one of them, it's like a stochastic system.

05:52.660 --> 05:56.800
 They have desires, it's like a random collection of desires,

05:56.800 --> 05:59.000
 somehow rooted in our evolutionary history,

05:59.000 --> 06:01.600
 but mostly random in terms of preference

06:01.600 --> 06:04.240
 of banana or apple, that kind of thing.

06:04.240 --> 06:08.600
 And then they also have the capacity for competence

06:08.600 --> 06:11.880
 and excellence in particular kind of labor.

06:11.880 --> 06:16.560
 So like specialization, they're able to be like incredible

06:16.560 --> 06:18.140
 at a particular set of tasks.

06:18.140 --> 06:20.760
 So there's a bunch of ants running around

06:20.760 --> 06:23.180
 with consciousness and intelligence,

06:23.180 --> 06:26.560
 and they have desires and they have capabilities.

06:26.560 --> 06:31.560
 And then there's a coincidence of both the wants they have

06:32.840 --> 06:34.520
 and the capabilities they have,

06:34.520 --> 06:36.320
 and you wanted to create a system

06:36.320 --> 06:39.300
 that kind of exchanges those things.

06:39.300 --> 06:44.300
 So when you imagine like what is a good, what is markets?

06:45.160 --> 06:49.600
 When you imagine a market is like a hierarchical system,

06:49.600 --> 06:50.880
 what do you imagine?

06:50.880 --> 06:51.920
 What is a market?

06:52.960 --> 06:53.920
 A market is just the name

06:53.920 --> 06:55.720
 for the naturally emergent phenomena

06:55.720 --> 06:58.300
 of people voluntarily exchanging things.

06:58.300 --> 07:00.060
 It's at any scale.

07:00.060 --> 07:01.280
 At any scale, yeah.

07:01.280 --> 07:03.160
 Individually, it could be a market of two people

07:03.160 --> 07:04.600
 on an island on their own.

07:04.600 --> 07:07.900
 It could be 8 billion people across the planet.

07:07.900 --> 07:09.480
 Naturally emerging.

07:09.480 --> 07:12.480
 Yes, this is the thing I think that is very hard

07:12.480 --> 07:15.440
 for many people who don't have a good understanding

07:15.440 --> 07:18.880
 of economics to grasp that capitalism and markets

07:18.880 --> 07:23.480
 are not something that you need a central planner

07:23.480 --> 07:26.840
 or a government officer to make happen.

07:26.840 --> 07:28.300
 Capitalism is just what happens

07:28.300 --> 07:30.080
 when people are left to their own devices.

07:30.080 --> 07:34.420
 It's just our cognitive capacity allows us to develop tools

07:34.420 --> 07:36.240
 that we can use for production.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.920
 And that's what we do.

07:37.920 --> 07:39.040
 That's what humans have been doing

07:39.040 --> 07:42.160
 since they started making spears to hunt.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.260
 That's the first capital good probably.

07:44.260 --> 07:46.240
 So we're constantly accumulating capital.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.720
 We're constantly trading with one another.

07:47.720 --> 07:49.400
 We find an opportunity.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.560
 You've got a lot of oranges.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.520
 I've got a lot of apples.

07:52.520 --> 07:53.840
 Then I'll take some of yours.

07:53.840 --> 07:54.680
 You'll take some of mine.

07:54.680 --> 07:56.040
 We're both better off.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.920
 This is just a naturally emergent thing.

07:58.920 --> 08:03.080
 And money is what makes it enormously powerful.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.320
 Money is what allows it to scale really.

08:05.320 --> 08:09.240
 Money is what allows it to go beyond small societies

08:09.240 --> 08:11.320
 into just something that is global.

08:11.320 --> 08:14.940
 Because with money, again, as I was saying earlier,

08:14.940 --> 08:17.120
 all you need to do is specialize in doing one thing,

08:17.120 --> 08:18.340
 the thing that you do best,

08:18.340 --> 08:19.800
 and then you exchange that for money.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.300
 And you don't have to worry

08:21.300 --> 08:24.320
 about whether the other people involved in this

08:24.320 --> 08:26.600
 want what you have and have what you want.

08:26.600 --> 08:30.000
 You just sell it for money to whoever wants it.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.840
 And you buy whatever you want from whoever has it.

08:32.840 --> 08:37.240
 And that's an enormous reduction in the mental burden

08:37.240 --> 08:39.480
 of how a market economy functions.

08:39.480 --> 08:40.920
 So the first thing that I would say about money

08:40.920 --> 08:43.160
 is that it allows for the division of labor

08:43.160 --> 08:45.400
 and it allows for the market system to grow.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.000
 And the second thing is that money is a mechanism

08:48.000 --> 08:50.580
 for storing value into the future.

08:50.580 --> 08:53.760
 So again, as humans, we develop the capacity

08:53.760 --> 08:55.840
 to think for the future.

08:55.840 --> 08:58.640
 We make a spear so that we can hunt,

08:58.640 --> 09:00.360
 and then we see that it works.

09:00.360 --> 09:01.640
 And then we take it out of the animal

09:01.640 --> 09:02.960
 that we hunted it with,

09:02.960 --> 09:05.600
 and we keep it for the next day's hunt.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.120
 And then we start making a better spear,

09:07.120 --> 09:08.480
 and we make a better fishing rod,

09:08.480 --> 09:09.720
 and then we make a fishing net,

09:09.720 --> 09:11.360
 and then we make a fishing boat.

09:11.360 --> 09:15.200
 And that's our ability to think of the future.

09:15.200 --> 09:18.000
 And as we start building durable goods,

09:18.000 --> 09:19.840
 we start thinking more and more of the future.

09:19.840 --> 09:22.940
 We start becoming more and more future oriented.

09:22.940 --> 09:26.580
 And that's really the process of civilization,

09:26.580 --> 09:29.480
 the process of denying our needs now

09:29.480 --> 09:31.140
 in order to think for the future.

09:31.140 --> 09:33.760
 So instead of spending all of our day on the beach,

09:33.760 --> 09:38.080
 enjoying ourselves, we take time off from leisure

09:38.080 --> 09:42.480
 on the beach and spend some time making a spear

09:42.480 --> 09:45.320
 or making a fishing rod so that our productivity

09:45.320 --> 09:48.120
 in hunting or fishing tomorrow is gonna be higher.

09:48.120 --> 09:51.840
 And so that ability to think for the future

09:51.840 --> 09:54.680
 is enhanced by our ability to provide for the future.

09:54.680 --> 09:56.840
 And we do that with durable goods.

09:56.840 --> 10:00.760
 But then money ends up being the best mechanism

10:00.760 --> 10:02.160
 for providing for the future,

10:02.160 --> 10:04.440
 because the future is uncertain.

10:04.440 --> 10:07.960
 So you can save your apples and oranges.

10:07.960 --> 10:09.600
 You can save the spears.

10:09.600 --> 10:12.120
 You can save the animal that you hunted.

10:12.120 --> 10:15.240
 But these things, first they rot.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.620
 They're not very good at holding onto their value over time.

10:17.620 --> 10:19.160
 But even if they were,

10:19.160 --> 10:22.440
 even if you have objects that are durable,

10:22.440 --> 10:24.400
 the problem with them is that you don't know

10:24.400 --> 10:28.200
 if you need them tomorrow or next month or next year.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.320
 You're not sure if you're going to be needing them.

10:30.320 --> 10:31.920
 And you might end up not needing them.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.960
 And you might end up not finding anybody who needs them

10:33.960 --> 10:35.200
 or finding somebody who needs them,

10:35.200 --> 10:36.440
 but doesn't value them much

10:36.440 --> 10:38.380
 and won't give you much in exchange.

10:38.380 --> 10:40.040
 Money allows you the optionality

10:40.040 --> 10:43.760
 of saving the most liquid good, the most saleable good.

10:43.760 --> 10:46.000
 So it's something that you can sell tomorrow

10:46.000 --> 10:47.720
 with the least uncertainty.

10:47.720 --> 10:49.400
 It has the most liquidity, the most ability

10:49.400 --> 10:52.520
 to be sold without a loss in its value.

10:52.520 --> 10:55.080
 So money is our most advanced technology

10:55.080 --> 10:58.480
 and our best technology for moving value into the future.

10:58.480 --> 11:01.320
 And so I think history really,

11:01.320 --> 11:03.680
 I argue this in all my books,

11:03.680 --> 11:06.440
 is that really history we see,

11:06.440 --> 11:10.640
 we can think of it as a process of our money gets harder.

11:10.640 --> 11:12.860
 And so our money gets better

11:12.860 --> 11:16.040
 at holding onto its value for the future.

11:16.040 --> 11:18.540
 And by harder, I mean harder to produce.

11:18.540 --> 11:20.760
 We find things that are hard to produce

11:20.760 --> 11:23.080
 that are better at holding onto their value.

11:23.080 --> 11:25.400
 So they hold onto their value better for the future.

11:25.400 --> 11:28.300
 And that allows us to plot and plan for the future.

11:28.300 --> 11:31.160
 That makes the future less uncertain.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.940
 And that makes us more future oriented.

11:33.940 --> 11:36.600
 In other words, it lowers our time preference.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.800
 And the harder the money is,

11:38.800 --> 11:41.480
 the better it is at allowing us to think of the future.

11:41.480 --> 11:44.960
 So people should know that you've written the book

11:44.960 --> 11:48.760
 Bitcoin Standard from 2018, I believe.

11:48.760 --> 11:51.200
 And then a new book called Fiat Standard.

11:52.080 --> 11:55.400
 The Bitcoin Standard is considered kind of the Bible

11:55.400 --> 11:57.760
 in the cryptocurrency space, in the Bitcoin space

11:57.760 --> 12:01.720
 of just a very rigorous systematic explanation

12:01.720 --> 12:06.360
 of why Bitcoin, what is it, why should it be,

12:06.360 --> 12:07.440
 why is it good?

12:07.440 --> 12:10.780
 So you're describing in that book and in the new book,

12:10.780 --> 12:14.240
 different implementations of the technology of money.

12:14.240 --> 12:17.520
 In the new book, you talk about fiat money,

12:17.520 --> 12:19.480
 which is another way to do money.

12:19.480 --> 12:22.600
 So obviously, there's a lot of different ways to do money.

12:22.600 --> 12:25.080
 And maybe you haven't discovered the best way to do money,

12:25.080 --> 12:28.320
 yet our conversation today is how to do money better.

12:29.440 --> 12:33.240
 Maybe we'll go back to bananas eventually, right?

12:33.240 --> 12:35.000
 Very good reasons why we won't.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.280
 Well, we can disagree.

12:37.280 --> 12:39.400
 We can agree to disagree on this.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.400
 I'm open minded to the bananas.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.140
 One of the biggest source of joy to me

12:44.140 --> 12:48.040
 when I first came to this country is eating bananas.

12:48.040 --> 12:53.040
 And so maybe money, happiness, perishable happiness

12:53.040 --> 12:58.040
 will eventually become the best medium of exchange.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.040
 I don't know, open minded.

13:00.040 --> 13:03.180
 Anyway, so you mentioned hard money and soft money.

13:03.180 --> 13:05.480
 So there's different ways to do money.

13:05.480 --> 13:06.560
 What is hard money?

13:06.560 --> 13:08.360
 What is soft money?

13:08.360 --> 13:10.360
 In the Bitcoin standard, I present the argument

13:10.360 --> 13:14.820
 that money is always whatever is the hardest thing to make.

13:14.820 --> 13:17.460
 Historically, I think we see many examples of that.

13:17.460 --> 13:20.080
 So for instance, in prison, people use cigarettes as money

13:20.080 --> 13:22.320
 because nobody can make cigarettes in prison.

13:22.320 --> 13:25.240
 In societies, we have the example of Yap Island,

13:25.240 --> 13:28.080
 for instance, it's an island that doesn't have any limestone

13:28.080 --> 13:31.360
 but there's a nearby island that has a lot of limestone.

13:31.360 --> 13:34.640
 And it's very expensive obviously with primitive technology

13:34.640 --> 13:38.160
 to move limestone from Palau to Yap.

13:38.160 --> 13:41.600
 So on Yap, limestones were money.

13:41.600 --> 13:44.040
 Seashells, rare seashells that are not easy to find

13:44.040 --> 13:48.200
 end up serving as money in places where they're rare.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.720
 Glass beads were money in West Africa

13:50.720 --> 13:52.720
 where there was no glass making technology

13:52.720 --> 13:54.680
 because they were imported from abroad

13:54.680 --> 13:56.280
 and they were very hard to make.

13:57.280 --> 13:59.400
 And I think there's a conscious effort

13:59.400 --> 14:02.280
 of some people might recognize the hardness

14:02.280 --> 14:04.480
 and the scarcity and choose this as money.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.920
 But I think what's more important

14:05.920 --> 14:08.480
 is just a natural evolutionary process

14:08.480 --> 14:12.920
 whereby people choose all kinds of random things as money,

14:12.920 --> 14:14.600
 bananas maybe even.

14:14.600 --> 14:17.360
 But then the people who end up making these bad choices

14:17.360 --> 14:18.960
 don't end up with any wealth left.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.320
 Whereas the people who store their wealth

14:21.320 --> 14:24.040
 in the things that are hard to make

14:24.040 --> 14:26.880
 end up maintaining their wealth

14:26.880 --> 14:29.120
 and maybe even increasing it over time.

14:29.120 --> 14:32.000
 And of course this culminated in the 19th century,

14:32.000 --> 14:33.160
 in the end of the 19th century

14:33.160 --> 14:36.920
 by basically the entire planet being on a gold standard.

14:36.920 --> 14:37.760
 And that's...

14:37.760 --> 14:38.640
 What is a gold standard?

14:38.640 --> 14:41.800
 The gold standard is basically when money is gold

14:41.800 --> 14:44.720
 or at least government currencies backed by gold.

14:44.720 --> 14:46.800
 But the reason gold became money

14:46.800 --> 14:49.120
 and not copper, not nickel, not bananas

14:49.120 --> 14:52.160
 is that gold is the hardest metal in the world.

14:52.160 --> 14:55.960
 And it is the hardest metal to increase the supply of.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.000
 And the reason for that is based in chemistry.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.080
 So gold is indestructible.

15:01.080 --> 15:03.680
 You can't destroy gold in any meaningful sense.

15:03.680 --> 15:08.680
 It's been accumulating stockpiles for thousands of years.

15:08.680 --> 15:12.400
 The gold that was worn by Nefertiti back in ancient Egypt

15:12.400 --> 15:16.080
 is today probably in somebody's necklace

15:16.080 --> 15:17.120
 or in somebody's gold coin.

15:17.120 --> 15:17.960
 It's still there.

15:17.960 --> 15:21.000
 So for thousands of years, humans have been digging for gold.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.240
 They dig it out of the ground, they refine it

15:23.240 --> 15:25.880
 and then they put it in a jewelry or a coin

15:25.880 --> 15:27.440
 and then it just stays there.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.880
 It gets melted down into new other forms.

15:29.880 --> 15:31.520
 The jewelry gets turned into coins

15:31.520 --> 15:33.200
 or coins get turned into bars.

15:34.240 --> 15:38.560
 But it's just stockpiles that are accumulating.

15:38.560 --> 15:41.920
 On the other hand, every year we get better

15:41.920 --> 15:43.880
 at our technology of looking for gold.

15:43.880 --> 15:45.400
 There's more people all over the world.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.880
 The population increases, the technology improves.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.960
 So we keep finding more and more gold

15:49.960 --> 15:52.080
 and we keep making the stockpiles bigger.

15:52.080 --> 15:55.240
 However, because we're constantly adding to a stockpile

15:55.240 --> 15:57.720
 that is not being devalued,

15:57.720 --> 15:59.280
 sorry, that is not being consumed

15:59.280 --> 16:00.600
 because there's no way of consuming gold.

16:00.600 --> 16:04.800
 You can't eat it, you can't burn it, it doesn't rust.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.320
 Because of that, we're constantly adding

16:07.320 --> 16:08.920
 to a constantly growing stockpile.

16:08.920 --> 16:11.000
 So if you look at the numbers,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.240
 you see over the last 100 years,

16:13.240 --> 16:16.360
 we've got pretty reliable data on gold production worldwide.

16:16.360 --> 16:19.120
 We see that pretty much gold stockpiles increase

16:19.120 --> 16:22.480
 at around one and a half to 2% per year, every year.

16:22.480 --> 16:25.200
 So yes, we're making more every year,

16:25.200 --> 16:28.080
 but we're making more so we're adding to the stockpile.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.200
 The stockpile grows more.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.560
 So every year we're adding only around one and a half

16:31.560 --> 16:33.840
 to 2%.

16:33.840 --> 16:36.360
 Compare that to the second highest,

16:36.360 --> 16:39.160
 the second hardest metal historically was silver.

16:39.160 --> 16:42.400
 And that increased historically at around maybe 5%

16:42.400 --> 16:43.720
 per year or so.

16:43.720 --> 16:46.840
 Now it probably increases at something like closer to 30%

16:46.840 --> 16:49.160
 because it's now getting used extensively

16:49.160 --> 16:50.840
 in industrial uses.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.920
 So when you use it in industry,

16:53.920 --> 16:56.440
 when you put silver in a laptop or in a camera

16:56.440 --> 16:59.520
 or in a machine, effectively,

16:59.520 --> 17:01.040
 you are consuming the stockpile

17:01.040 --> 17:02.600
 because it's not used as money.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.920
 It's taken out of the monetary stockpile.

17:04.920 --> 17:08.320
 So over the last 150 years, since 1870 in particular,

17:08.320 --> 17:11.960
 and I discussed this in detail in the Bitcoin standard,

17:11.960 --> 17:14.600
 what happened in 1870 was Germany won

17:14.600 --> 17:18.960
 the Franco Prussian war and Germany was on a silver standard,

17:18.960 --> 17:21.160
 but the value of silvers was declining.

17:21.160 --> 17:22.640
 So Germany did something very smart,

17:22.640 --> 17:25.640
 which is they took their indemnity from France

17:25.640 --> 17:30.480
 in silver and gold and use that big chunk of gold

17:30.480 --> 17:33.040
 to switch to going on a gold standard.

17:33.040 --> 17:36.720
 And since then, silver has been collapsing in value

17:36.720 --> 17:37.560
 next to gold.

17:37.560 --> 17:40.080
 So back then the price of an ounce of gold

17:40.080 --> 17:42.080
 was around 15 ounces of silver.

17:42.080 --> 17:43.400
 Today it's closer to 100.

17:43.400 --> 17:46.520
 It's just been declining for the last 150 years.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.480
 And so because of that, because of the fact

17:48.480 --> 17:50.720
 that it's lost its monetary role

17:50.720 --> 17:52.840
 as people shifted toward gold,

17:52.840 --> 17:54.560
 the value of silver went down

17:54.560 --> 17:56.120
 and so it became economical to use it

17:56.120 --> 17:58.240
 in more and more industrial applications.

17:58.240 --> 18:01.880
 So the stockpile declines and then as a result

18:01.880 --> 18:05.160
 that weakens its monetary properties

18:05.160 --> 18:06.720
 more and more and more.

18:06.720 --> 18:09.520
 So that's why by the end of the 19th century,

18:09.520 --> 18:10.840
 I mean at the beginning of the 19th century,

18:10.840 --> 18:12.120
 gold and silver were money.

18:12.120 --> 18:14.400
 By the end, it was basically only gold.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.800
 And the countries that were still on a silver standard,

18:16.800 --> 18:19.680
 China and India in particular suffered enormously from it

18:19.680 --> 18:22.920
 because their money was devaluing very quickly

18:22.920 --> 18:25.800
 next to gold and so Europeans who would come to China

18:25.800 --> 18:28.160
 or India were able to buy things

18:28.160 --> 18:30.280
 at practically a big discount.

18:30.280 --> 18:33.520
 So I hope it's okay if I ask very simple,

18:33.520 --> 18:34.600
 very basic questions.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.680
 There's few people in this world that are good,

18:37.680 --> 18:41.160
 as good as you are at answering very basic,

18:41.160 --> 18:42.920
 almost ridiculously basic questions

18:42.920 --> 18:45.960
 because I think exploring questions like what is money

18:45.960 --> 18:49.080
 is a really great way to think from first principles,

18:49.080 --> 18:50.760
 to really think deeply about this world.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.640
 So I really appreciate you doing that.

18:52.640 --> 18:55.600
 When you say standard, what does it mean?

18:55.600 --> 18:57.560
 When you say silver standard, gold standard,

18:57.560 --> 18:59.920
 again with a basic question.

18:59.920 --> 19:03.800
 The term really I think was based out of gold.

19:03.800 --> 19:06.240
 The first time this came out was the gold standard

19:06.240 --> 19:09.280
 because so I said gold was money

19:09.280 --> 19:10.960
 at the end of the 19th century,

19:10.960 --> 19:13.520
 but it wasn't just that everybody was using gold coins

19:13.520 --> 19:15.080
 and trading with gold coins

19:15.080 --> 19:19.320
 because that's got a problem of divisibility.

19:19.320 --> 19:23.400
 So a lot of things are worth less than one gold coin.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.160
 So how do you buy that thing?

19:25.160 --> 19:28.080
 And the answer was that you created the monetary instruments

19:28.080 --> 19:31.560
 that were backed by gold and so currencies,

19:31.560 --> 19:34.360
 national currencies under the gold standard

19:34.360 --> 19:36.760
 were specific units of gold

19:36.760 --> 19:38.960
 and that's how a gold standard functioned.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.960
 Money was gold, but you had pieces of paper

19:41.960 --> 19:43.880
 that were redeemable in gold.

19:43.880 --> 19:45.080
 So you could go to the central bank,

19:45.080 --> 19:46.920
 you'd give them the piece of paper,

19:46.920 --> 19:49.120
 the $100 bill or the $10 bill

19:49.120 --> 19:50.960
 and they'll give you gold in exchange

19:50.960 --> 19:53.760
 and they give you a specific quantity of gold in exchange.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.200
 Effectively, the paper was just a receipt for gold.

19:56.200 --> 19:59.440
 So the paper exactly represented the amount of gold.

19:59.440 --> 20:01.080
 Exactly, that was the plan.

20:01.080 --> 20:03.160
 That was what it's supposed to do,

20:03.160 --> 20:07.240
 but arguably we never had a pure gold standard

20:07.240 --> 20:09.200
 because the nature of gold means

20:09.200 --> 20:12.000
 that the people who are in charge of the gold,

20:12.000 --> 20:13.480
 they have an enormous amount of power

20:13.480 --> 20:15.120
 because the gold is concentrated with them

20:15.120 --> 20:17.800
 and as long as not everybody shows up at the same time

20:17.800 --> 20:18.840
 asking for their gold,

20:18.840 --> 20:21.720
 then you can make more receipts than you have gold.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.160
 So there's always shady stuff going on,

20:24.160 --> 20:26.120
 but at least that's the state of gold

20:26.120 --> 20:28.320
 is the receipts should exactly represent

20:28.320 --> 20:29.840
 the amount of gold there.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.720
 And also when you say standard,

20:31.720 --> 20:36.720
 it means that governments sort of publicly stated

20:38.160 --> 20:40.480
 that this is the approved,

20:40.480 --> 20:44.040
 the main way of making transactions that are monetary.

20:44.040 --> 20:46.760
 So this is the money, this is the official money

20:46.760 --> 20:48.760
 that you should be using if you live in this country.

20:48.760 --> 20:51.320
 Yes, although I would say it's more like

20:51.320 --> 20:52.160
 the other way around.

20:52.160 --> 20:55.440
 It's not that the governments established gold as money.

20:55.440 --> 21:00.040
 It's more like gold gave the governments

21:00.040 --> 21:01.920
 the credibility for their currencies.

21:01.920 --> 21:06.320
 So governments were not the ones that made gold money.

21:06.320 --> 21:09.480
 Gold has been money before states were invented.

21:10.440 --> 21:12.240
 States, if you have a government

21:12.240 --> 21:14.200
 and you'd like to have some legitimacy

21:14.200 --> 21:16.600
 and you'd like to be able to deal with other governments

21:16.600 --> 21:19.800
 on an equal footing, you had to go by the gold standard.

21:19.800 --> 21:22.480
 You had to have a currency that was redeemable in gold

21:22.480 --> 21:24.120
 so that you could trade with the rest of the world

21:24.120 --> 21:28.160
 so that people could in your country use that currency.

21:28.160 --> 21:32.120
 So it's not that governments were choosing gold.

21:32.120 --> 21:35.440
 It's more like they were having to adapt

21:35.440 --> 21:37.760
 their own currencies to gold

21:37.760 --> 21:39.360
 in order to give their currencies credibility.

21:39.360 --> 21:40.960
 So there's a dance there though,

21:40.960 --> 21:43.560
 because if they had to,

21:43.560 --> 21:46.520
 then why did they switch away from it after?

21:46.520 --> 21:49.640
 So there is a dance where the governments,

21:49.640 --> 21:52.120
 the people pressure.

21:52.120 --> 21:56.040
 So first of all, the basic characteristics

21:56.040 --> 21:59.720
 of the hard money pressures the governments

21:59.720 --> 22:02.720
 and the people in terms of what should be used.

22:02.720 --> 22:05.200
 Then the people, based on their community,

22:05.200 --> 22:09.200
 the network effects, the narratives they tell each other,

22:09.200 --> 22:12.400
 all that kind of stuff, they pressure the governments

22:12.400 --> 22:14.080
 to take on a particular money.

22:14.080 --> 22:17.960
 Then the governments, they like power,

22:17.960 --> 22:19.720
 they like control, all those kinds of things.

22:19.720 --> 22:21.080
 They pressure the people

22:21.080 --> 22:22.280
 and tell different kinds of narratives.

22:22.280 --> 22:24.880
 So there's a dance going on in this evolution

22:24.880 --> 22:27.400
 of what technology to use for a monetary system.

22:27.400 --> 22:32.400
 So the reason I don't know if governments had to,

22:32.400 --> 22:34.240
 because they clearly didn't have to,

22:34.240 --> 22:37.440
 because they eventually moved away from it.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.040
 But there was pressure probably.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.320
 Yeah, but even after they moved away from it,

22:41.320 --> 22:42.520
 central banks, until today,

22:42.520 --> 22:45.000
 they still hold a lot of gold reserves.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.480
 In fact, if you look at 1914,

22:47.480 --> 22:51.200
 when the world really went off the gold standard,

22:51.200 --> 22:53.720
 the amount of gold reserves held by central banks

22:53.720 --> 22:55.720
 was a tiny fraction of what it was.

22:55.720 --> 22:57.440
 As time went on,

22:57.440 --> 22:59.840
 central banks accumulated more and more gold.

22:59.840 --> 23:02.160
 What ended up happening is they prevented their citizens

23:02.160 --> 23:04.240
 from using the gold, but they continued to use it.

23:04.240 --> 23:07.560
 So gold continued to be money up until 1971

23:07.560 --> 23:10.800
 because effectively the world was on a dollar standard

23:10.800 --> 23:12.960
 and the dollars were backed by gold.

23:12.960 --> 23:15.600
 But then after 1971, even then,

23:15.600 --> 23:17.280
 central banks continued to accumulate gold

23:17.280 --> 23:20.000
 because why would you as a central bank

23:20.000 --> 23:22.520
 want to accumulate pieces of paper effectively

23:22.520 --> 23:25.240
 or credit liabilities of another central bank

23:25.240 --> 23:27.960
 that can produce them infinitely?

23:27.960 --> 23:31.800
 And it's a lesson that's becoming more and more obvious

23:31.800 --> 23:33.680
 to governments today,

23:33.680 --> 23:36.640
 as we see US sanctions taking, say, Russian reserves

23:36.640 --> 23:37.960
 or Afghanistan reserves.

23:39.040 --> 23:40.840
 And this is why we see China and Russia

23:40.840 --> 23:44.080
 have accumulated a lot of gold over the last 10, 20 years.

23:44.080 --> 23:48.440
 So just to return to the question of definitions,

23:48.440 --> 23:51.000
 so what is hard money versus soft money?

23:51.000 --> 23:54.120
 Yes, so hard, I mean, it's a relative thing,

23:54.120 --> 23:56.560
 but the hardness refers to the difficulty

23:56.560 --> 23:59.520
 of producing more units of the money supply.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.640
 So an easy money would be a money

24:01.640 --> 24:04.480
 that is relatively easy to make.

24:04.480 --> 24:08.840
 So you can increase the supply by 10, 20, 30, 40, 50%

24:08.840 --> 24:09.680
 or something like that.

24:09.680 --> 24:12.640
 So pretty much all commodities, all market commodities,

24:12.640 --> 24:15.560
 other than gold and silver, they're easy money

24:15.560 --> 24:18.920
 and they're not suitable as a monetary medium

24:18.920 --> 24:20.160
 because they're being consumed.

24:20.160 --> 24:22.320
 So if you look at, and in the Bitcoin standard,

24:22.320 --> 24:25.080
 I mentioned this metric called the stock to flow ratio,

24:25.080 --> 24:28.840
 which is the ratio of the annual production, the flow,

24:28.840 --> 24:31.480
 to the stockpile, the existing stockpile.

24:31.480 --> 24:33.120
 If you look at all the other metals,

24:33.120 --> 24:36.160
 they're easy money because they're being consumed.

24:36.160 --> 24:38.360
 So think about how much stockpiles of copper

24:38.360 --> 24:40.120
 there are in the world today.

24:40.120 --> 24:41.960
 So copper companies obviously have

24:41.960 --> 24:44.000
 some stockpiles of copper.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.080
 Major copper consumers will have stockpiles of copper,

24:47.080 --> 24:48.600
 but the vast majority of copper

24:48.600 --> 24:53.120
 is essentially on a conveyor belt of production

24:53.120 --> 24:56.840
 from the mine straight to the consumer good

24:56.840 --> 24:58.480
 that it's being used for.

24:58.480 --> 25:01.800
 So the existing stockpiles are roughly

25:01.800 --> 25:04.920
 in the range of one year's production.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.800
 If you take all of the companies,

25:06.800 --> 25:09.040
 I don't have exact statistics,

25:09.040 --> 25:10.440
 hence it's very difficult to get these,

25:10.440 --> 25:12.760
 but it's roughly in the same range.

25:12.760 --> 25:17.280
 Like if copper production were to stop completely today,

25:17.280 --> 25:19.520
 we'll have about a year's production

25:19.520 --> 25:22.000
 stored in various places.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.720
 So that makes copper terrible money

25:24.720 --> 25:27.480
 because if you started using copper as money,

25:27.480 --> 25:28.880
 and this is why a lot of people say,

25:28.880 --> 25:30.680
 well, money is a collective illusion.

25:30.680 --> 25:34.240
 Money is a social construct.

25:34.240 --> 25:35.960
 If we all agree that something is money,

25:35.960 --> 25:36.800
 then something is money.

25:36.800 --> 25:37.880
 I think this is completely clueless,

25:37.880 --> 25:40.000
 and it's usually Marxists who believe this,

25:40.000 --> 25:42.280
 obviously no understanding of economics.

25:42.280 --> 25:43.360
 It's completely clueless

25:43.360 --> 25:45.640
 because even if everybody in society

25:45.640 --> 25:47.880
 decided we wanted to make copper as money,

25:47.880 --> 25:50.400
 even if we all decided to collectively

25:50.400 --> 25:53.320
 take part in this hallucination or illusion,

25:53.320 --> 25:54.960
 it would not make copper money.

25:54.960 --> 25:56.720
 It would just make everybody who decides

25:56.720 --> 25:59.480
 to take part in this hallucination poor, that's it.

25:59.480 --> 26:01.040
 It would make copper miners rich.

26:01.040 --> 26:02.240
 It would make all of the people

26:02.240 --> 26:04.160
 who chose copper as money poor,

26:04.160 --> 26:05.640
 and copper would not be money.

26:05.640 --> 26:07.720
 It can't work because what happens is,

26:07.720 --> 26:10.280
 because of the fact that the stockpiles are so small,

26:10.280 --> 26:11.320
 if you buy, you know,

26:11.320 --> 26:14.120
 even if you get the 1,000 richest people in the world,

26:14.120 --> 26:16.240
 all of the world's billionaires,

26:16.240 --> 26:17.080
 they get together,

26:17.080 --> 26:19.680
 and they all dump all of the money that they have,

26:19.680 --> 26:22.520
 all the stocks, all the bonds, all the gold,

26:22.520 --> 26:24.440
 all of the Bitcoin, everything that they own,

26:24.440 --> 26:27.520
 they dump it, and they buy copper with it.

26:27.520 --> 26:28.360
 What's gonna happen?

26:28.360 --> 26:30.840
 Price of copper is gonna go up a lot,

26:30.840 --> 26:33.040
 but what's gonna stop copper miners

26:33.040 --> 26:36.000
 from flooding the market with even more copper

26:36.000 --> 26:37.800
 than what the billionaires bought?

26:37.800 --> 26:38.640
 Nothing.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.880
 They're gonna dump all of that extra copper production.

26:41.880 --> 26:43.040
 If the price of copper is gonna go up

26:43.040 --> 26:45.640
 so there will be a lot more copper mining

26:45.640 --> 26:47.080
 than all the other metals,

26:47.080 --> 26:51.080
 a lot of nickel companies and gold miners

26:51.080 --> 26:53.480
 are gonna switch to focusing on copper,

26:53.480 --> 26:56.200
 and then we're gonna dump an enormous amount of copper

26:56.200 --> 26:57.040
 on the market.

26:57.040 --> 26:59.000
 The value of copper is gonna crash,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.560
 and the people who chose copper as money

27:01.560 --> 27:03.760
 are just gonna end up with large warehouses

27:03.760 --> 27:06.480
 of very cheap rusting metal.

27:06.480 --> 27:07.920
 So that's a brilliant description,

27:07.920 --> 27:09.880
 and that kind of pushes towards gold

27:09.880 --> 27:13.240
 where the stock to flow ratio,

27:13.240 --> 27:15.560
 I guess you would say is 1.5 to 2%,

27:15.560 --> 27:16.840
 like you mentioned earlier.

27:16.840 --> 27:18.680
 That would be like the inverse of the stock to flow.

27:18.680 --> 27:19.960
 That's the supply growth rate,

27:19.960 --> 27:21.240
 so the stock to flow is the inverse.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.560
 It's around 60.

27:22.560 --> 27:23.680
 60, got it.

27:23.680 --> 27:26.000
 But let me push back on,

27:26.000 --> 27:27.800
 as somebody who likes human psychology,

27:27.800 --> 27:30.920
 let me push back on the collective hallucination

27:30.920 --> 27:32.120
 and the illusion.

27:32.120 --> 27:35.860
 So that's for copper, but what about paper money?

27:35.860 --> 27:40.860
 That's not, you can't smoke it,

27:40.980 --> 27:42.420
 you can't eat it.

27:42.420 --> 27:44.820
 It's just, it's supposed to represent,

27:44.820 --> 27:47.020
 it's supposed to just be the medium of exchange,

27:47.020 --> 27:52.020
 and in that sense, what role does collective hallucination

27:53.980 --> 27:56.060
 play in the effectiveness of money?

27:56.060 --> 27:59.060
 Exactly zero, because all of the paper money,

27:59.060 --> 28:00.900
 first of all, there's never been an instance,

28:00.900 --> 28:04.780
 and again, this flies in the face

28:04.780 --> 28:08.180
 of a lot of what a lot of people like to think about money.

28:08.180 --> 28:09.420
 There's never been an instance

28:09.420 --> 28:11.980
 where a government came out and said,

28:11.980 --> 28:13.700
 all right, we're printing out these pieces of paper,

28:13.700 --> 28:14.540
 use them as money.

28:14.540 --> 28:19.020
 This one is worth 10 apples or use it for buying things,

28:19.020 --> 28:19.900
 and here's the piece of paper.

28:19.900 --> 28:21.340
 This has never happened.

28:21.340 --> 28:26.340
 They've always taken fiat money, paper money,

28:26.620 --> 28:30.660
 all of these things were always born out of fraud.

28:30.660 --> 28:32.740
 Initially, it was a receipt for gold,

28:32.740 --> 28:34.860
 and then they told you, well, you know,

28:34.860 --> 28:36.940
 you don't need the gold anyway, and you have to use this,

28:36.940 --> 28:39.460
 and then if you don't use it, we throw you in jail.

28:39.460 --> 28:41.580
 And then, so first of all, it doesn't,

28:42.900 --> 28:44.340
 you can't enforce this thing,

28:44.340 --> 28:45.700
 so it's never really just happened,

28:45.700 --> 28:48.340
 and it's never been hallucinated into existence.

28:48.340 --> 28:50.100
 People can hallucinate this kind of nonsense

28:50.100 --> 28:54.340
 in writing textbooks and books and in academia,

28:54.340 --> 28:57.580
 but in the real world, people don't hallucinate money.

28:57.580 --> 29:00.140
 People are very careful about what they put their money in.

29:00.140 --> 29:01.540
 For people listening,

29:01.540 --> 29:03.100
 we're gonna have fun in this conversation,

29:03.100 --> 29:08.100
 because you already said Marxist, fraud, hallucination,

29:08.340 --> 29:11.500
 just because we use these words doesn't mean they're true,

29:11.500 --> 29:12.900
 but they're fun to talk about.

29:12.900 --> 29:17.220
 So you have a strong certainty about the way you talk,

29:17.220 --> 29:20.100
 which I think is fun,

29:20.100 --> 29:22.400
 but allow me in my dumb self to push back,

29:22.400 --> 29:23.740
 to play devil's advocate,

29:23.740 --> 29:25.180
 and I'll actually ask you sometimes

29:25.180 --> 29:27.180
 to play devil's advocate if possible,

29:27.180 --> 29:28.880
 because you're smarter than me on all this stuff,

29:28.880 --> 29:33.500
 so we want the smartest devil's advocate possible,

29:33.500 --> 29:35.820
 and I'm certainly not that, but anyway,

29:35.820 --> 29:40.820
 but nevertheless, we are currently on a fiat standard,

29:41.460 --> 29:46.460
 so money does have value, paper money,

29:50.420 --> 29:51.900
 and the reason it has value

29:51.900 --> 29:53.780
 is because we believe it has value.

29:53.780 --> 29:57.760
 To what degree, if we put the hallucination word aside,

29:57.760 --> 30:01.220
 the belief that something is worth value

30:01.220 --> 30:06.060
 is actually value, and is the thing that helps money work,

30:06.060 --> 30:09.220
 because you're saying it's fraud,

30:09.220 --> 30:13.780
 and the belief is almost valueless,

30:13.780 --> 30:14.860
 but how much value?

30:14.860 --> 30:17.380
 Can we quantify the value of the belief,

30:17.380 --> 30:18.460
 the collective belief?

30:18.460 --> 30:21.660
 I should say, all economics is subjective.

30:21.660 --> 30:24.180
 I consider myself an Austrian school economist,

30:24.180 --> 30:26.740
 and the starting point of all Austrian economics

30:26.740 --> 30:28.900
 is that all value is subjective,

30:28.900 --> 30:33.300
 so obviously, value only exists

30:33.300 --> 30:35.900
 because humans choose to make the valuation.

30:35.900 --> 30:40.020
 However, the economic reality of the way that money works

30:40.020 --> 30:42.640
 means that it's just a technology like all others,

30:42.640 --> 30:45.060
 and so for me, when people say,

30:45.060 --> 30:47.220
 well, if we hallucinate that this thing can be money,

30:47.220 --> 30:48.220
 then it'll be money.

30:48.220 --> 30:49.900
 If we can hallucinate bananas to be money,

30:49.900 --> 30:50.860
 then it'll be money.

30:50.860 --> 30:52.380
 For me, it's like saying, well, if we hallucinate

30:52.380 --> 30:54.960
 that bananas can be spaceships, they'll be spaceships.

30:54.960 --> 30:56.940
 I mean, you can call them spaceships if you want,

30:56.940 --> 30:59.700
 but a banana's not gonna get you to the moon.

30:59.700 --> 31:03.080
 Well, then nevertheless, that's true.

31:03.080 --> 31:05.060
 So you're drawing a big distinction

31:05.060 --> 31:09.340
 between physical reality and the space of belief,

31:09.340 --> 31:14.340
 but it seems like so much power of human civilization,

31:14.580 --> 31:18.940
 so much destruction, so much creativity, creation,

31:18.940 --> 31:21.180
 happens in our minds.

31:21.180 --> 31:23.540
 Absolutely, everything does happen in the mind.

31:23.540 --> 31:24.980
 You're not gonna get to the moon,

31:24.980 --> 31:27.580
 but you might still have a significant impact

31:27.580 --> 31:31.540
 on human civilization if a lot of people believe a thing.

31:31.540 --> 31:35.420
 True, but economic reality exists in a way

31:35.420 --> 31:37.940
 in which your beliefs are rewarded

31:37.940 --> 31:40.620
 when they match up with economic reality,

31:40.620 --> 31:41.900
 and they're punished when they don't.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.740
 So if you ride a banana and jump off a cliff

31:44.740 --> 31:46.940
 thinking you're gonna get to the moon,

31:46.940 --> 31:48.620
 that solves the problem of people thinking

31:48.620 --> 31:50.620
 that bananas are spaceships by killing people

31:50.620 --> 31:53.020
 who think that bananas are spaceships.

31:53.020 --> 31:55.020
 And I think, to go back to your question

31:55.020 --> 31:56.820
 in terms of paper monies, so yes,

31:56.820 --> 32:01.380
 even though ignoring the original sin

32:01.380 --> 32:02.980
 of the creation of fiat money,

32:02.980 --> 32:05.460
 and ignoring everything that happened before 1971,

32:05.460 --> 32:07.860
 all right, well, here we are, people are using,

32:07.860 --> 32:09.340
 well, it's not really paper money.

32:09.340 --> 32:12.780
 We should say fiat money is predominantly credit.

32:12.780 --> 32:15.020
 So it's also a digital currency.

32:15.020 --> 32:18.780
 So more than 90% of dollars are digital.

32:18.780 --> 32:21.380
 Less than 10% of dollars are physical.

32:21.380 --> 32:22.740
 So it is a digital currency,

32:22.740 --> 32:24.700
 and all over the world, all these governments

32:24.700 --> 32:26.420
 are using digital currencies effectively

32:26.420 --> 32:29.500
 with some physical manifestations in paper.

32:29.500 --> 32:32.380
 But yet, even within these currencies,

32:32.380 --> 32:33.740
 it's still the same analysis,

32:33.740 --> 32:35.140
 and I discussed this in chapter four,

32:35.140 --> 32:36.300
 the Bitcoin standard.

32:36.300 --> 32:37.700
 You look at government monies,

32:37.700 --> 32:40.140
 you see that the currencies that have held onto their value,

32:40.140 --> 32:42.180
 the ones that have the biggest value,

32:42.180 --> 32:44.660
 the ones that play the biggest role in global trade,

32:44.660 --> 32:46.900
 the ones that are used as currency reserves

32:46.900 --> 32:48.100
 all over the world,

32:48.100 --> 32:50.860
 are the ones that have the lowest supply growth rate.

32:50.860 --> 32:53.420
 The ones that grow, whose central banks

32:53.420 --> 32:55.380
 are the least inflationary.

32:55.380 --> 32:56.420
 And on the other hand,

32:56.420 --> 32:58.900
 the ones who supplies more inflationary,

32:58.900 --> 33:00.900
 similar to copper, end up failing.

33:00.900 --> 33:03.460
 You look at Lebanon, Venezuela, Zimbabwe,

33:03.460 --> 33:06.500
 these are currencies whose supply increases very quickly,

33:06.500 --> 33:09.060
 and therefore, their value collapses.

33:09.060 --> 33:12.540
 Whereas the dollar, the Swiss franc, the Euro,

33:12.540 --> 33:14.940
 the British pound, the Japanese yen,

33:14.940 --> 33:17.140
 they increase at a much lower rate in general

33:17.140 --> 33:20.220
 than these terrible currencies.

33:20.220 --> 33:21.940
 And that's why all over the world,

33:21.940 --> 33:24.180
 you see people are looking to get more dollars

33:24.180 --> 33:28.180
 and more of these harder currencies than the easier ones.

33:28.180 --> 33:32.380
 So I think this analysis of the hardness of the money

33:32.380 --> 33:37.380
 and the ease of money is pretty well supported empirically.

33:37.580 --> 33:40.780
 So like you said, you're at least in part,

33:40.780 --> 33:43.740
 or in whole, consider yourself an Austrian economist.

33:44.740 --> 33:48.980
 So you're perhaps a great person to ask about the basics.

33:48.980 --> 33:50.500
 What is Austrian economics?

33:50.500 --> 33:52.220
 What is Keynesian economics?

33:52.220 --> 33:54.660
 How do you compare the two?

33:54.660 --> 33:56.340
 What should people know?

33:56.340 --> 33:59.580
 What are the interesting defining characteristics

33:59.580 --> 34:01.700
 to you about these schools of thought?

34:01.700 --> 34:03.340
 So Austrian economics, the way that I say it,

34:03.340 --> 34:04.900
 Austrian economics is economics.

34:04.900 --> 34:07.660
 It's, we call it Austrian economics

34:07.660 --> 34:09.420
 because economics has been hijacked

34:09.420 --> 34:11.420
 by a bunch of frauds, really.

34:11.420 --> 34:12.860
 Or people who are wrong, okay.

34:12.860 --> 34:14.540
 Well, it's much worse than wrong,

34:14.540 --> 34:16.620
 by people who are just essentially propagandists

34:16.620 --> 34:17.460
 for inflation.

34:17.460 --> 34:18.500
 Right.

34:18.500 --> 34:19.340
 So.

34:19.340 --> 34:20.180
 It's like your opinion, man.

34:20.180 --> 34:21.020
 Right.

34:21.020 --> 34:23.820
 Yeah, well, that's also like your opinion, man.

34:23.820 --> 34:24.660
 Yeah.

34:24.660 --> 34:25.500
 But you asked.

34:25.500 --> 34:26.340
 That's true.

34:26.340 --> 34:28.620
 Well, I also talked to Paul Krugman on this podcast.

34:28.620 --> 34:32.740
 So he's, the O speaks enough,

34:32.740 --> 34:35.500
 but he's one of the people

34:35.500 --> 34:38.700
 that is perhaps most harshly criticized

34:38.700 --> 34:42.660
 by folks in Austrian economics perspective

34:42.660 --> 34:45.740
 and vice versa, which is a fascinating tension.

34:45.740 --> 34:48.940
 Yeah, he's done a great job as an actor

34:48.940 --> 34:51.220
 who plays an economist on TV and the internet.

34:52.420 --> 34:55.420
 So anyway, now tell me what you really think.

34:55.420 --> 34:58.580
 No, but, so the basics of what is Austrian economics?

34:58.580 --> 35:00.580
 What is the, what perspective does it take on the world?

35:00.580 --> 35:02.980
 Yeah, so I mean, Austrian economics really is

35:03.900 --> 35:06.060
 the continuation of a tradition

35:06.060 --> 35:08.380
 that it goes back to the ancient Greeks

35:08.380 --> 35:09.660
 of studying economics.

35:09.660 --> 35:13.260
 Historically, it's really just economics

35:13.260 --> 35:14.620
 and that has evolved over time.

35:14.620 --> 35:19.620
 And the establishment of the Austrian school per se

35:20.300 --> 35:23.500
 came in 1871, 150 years ago,

35:23.500 --> 35:25.500
 when Karl Menger, the father of the school,

35:25.500 --> 35:28.100
 wrote a book called Principles of Economics

35:28.100 --> 35:30.820
 and essentially invented marginal analysis,

35:30.820 --> 35:32.780
 which is a big deal in economics.

35:32.780 --> 35:35.300
 Marginal analysis is the idea that in economics,

35:35.300 --> 35:37.780
 individuals carry out decisions at the margin,

35:37.780 --> 35:42.660
 that it's, when you make choice, you're not making it.

35:42.660 --> 35:43.980
 For instance, if you're making a choice

35:43.980 --> 35:46.740
 between what should I spend my money on,

35:46.740 --> 35:49.700
 you're not making a choice whether it is,

35:49.700 --> 35:51.820
 this thing is object A or B,

35:51.820 --> 35:53.820
 which one is more valuable for me in general,

35:53.820 --> 35:56.740
 which one is more valuable for me for the rest of my life.

35:56.740 --> 35:59.380
 You're choosing about the next unit right now

35:59.380 --> 36:00.900
 at this point, at this stage.

36:00.900 --> 36:04.060
 And if you analyze economic decision making at the margin,

36:04.060 --> 36:05.980
 it makes a lot more sense and you can understand

36:05.980 --> 36:08.740
 why people decide and make the decisions that they do.

36:09.660 --> 36:12.540
 Whereas if you don't apply marginal analysis,

36:12.540 --> 36:14.300
 things don't make sense.

36:14.300 --> 36:17.220
 The key thing that marginal analysis helps us solve

36:17.220 --> 36:19.780
 is what is called the water diamond paradox.

36:19.780 --> 36:22.220
 So you will die without water.

36:22.220 --> 36:25.820
 We all need water and yet water is dirt cheap.

36:25.820 --> 36:29.260
 Whereas diamonds are extremely superfluous,

36:29.260 --> 36:30.940
 nobody needs them.

36:30.940 --> 36:33.660
 Nobody is gonna live or die because they have a diamond

36:33.660 --> 36:35.460
 and yet they're extremely expensive.

36:35.460 --> 36:37.020
 So why is it that as human beings,

36:37.020 --> 36:41.660
 we pay maybe say a dollar a liter for water,

36:41.660 --> 36:43.140
 whereas we pay thousands of dollars

36:43.140 --> 36:44.940
 for a few grams of diamonds.

36:44.940 --> 36:46.140
 Why is this the case?

36:46.140 --> 36:49.260
 Do we value water less than diamond?

36:49.260 --> 36:53.940
 The answer is no, but at the margin where we are right now,

36:53.940 --> 36:55.860
 you live in a place where water is very abundant

36:55.860 --> 36:57.900
 because cities are only built in places

36:57.900 --> 36:59.620
 where water is abundant.

36:59.620 --> 37:03.500
 And you're only making a choice

37:03.500 --> 37:05.300
 about the next unit of water.

37:05.300 --> 37:07.260
 And so water is extremely abundant

37:07.260 --> 37:10.380
 and you're choosing about whether to spend

37:10.380 --> 37:14.580
 the next unit of money on water.

37:14.580 --> 37:16.420
 The valuation that you give to water,

37:16.420 --> 37:18.900
 given that you have a lot of water at home

37:18.900 --> 37:21.420
 and that you live in a place that has abundant water

37:21.420 --> 37:24.660
 is pretty low to the marginal unit,

37:24.660 --> 37:26.940
 but it's very high for water overall.

37:26.940 --> 37:28.420
 So if I asked you,

37:28.420 --> 37:31.980
 how much would you spend for water in general?

37:31.980 --> 37:34.940
 How much would you pay for water for all of your life?

37:34.940 --> 37:36.980
 It would be a lot higher than diamonds.

37:36.980 --> 37:39.180
 If I told you, you can only have water or diamonds

37:39.180 --> 37:40.500
 for the rest of your life.

37:40.500 --> 37:42.340
 You choose water, obviously,

37:42.340 --> 37:44.940
 but nobody's ever had to make that choice.

37:44.940 --> 37:47.220
 You only make your choices at the margin.

37:47.220 --> 37:50.300
 So at the margin where we are, modern civilization,

37:50.300 --> 37:51.540
 we have an abundance of water.

37:51.540 --> 37:53.100
 That's why we have civilization

37:53.100 --> 37:54.980
 and diamonds are very rare and scarce.

37:54.980 --> 37:58.340
 And people are only buying,

37:58.340 --> 38:01.780
 you buy your first diamond when you're gonna get married,

38:01.780 --> 38:03.260
 you give it to your wife

38:03.260 --> 38:06.660
 and that's gonna be the first few grams of diamond

38:06.660 --> 38:07.500
 that she's ever gonna own.

38:07.500 --> 38:09.980
 Giving my wife water.

38:09.980 --> 38:10.820
 Smart move.

38:10.820 --> 38:13.180
 You should definitely give her Bitcoin instead of diamonds.

38:13.180 --> 38:15.660
 I tell my wife, I occasionally remind her

38:15.660 --> 38:18.100
 of how many Bitcoin we could have had

38:18.100 --> 38:20.300
 if I bought her Bitcoin with the price of the diamond ring.

38:20.300 --> 38:22.580
 What's the downside of, by the way, diamonds

38:22.580 --> 38:25.620
 from the analysis of like gold and so on?

38:25.620 --> 38:27.020
 Ah, that's a great question.

38:28.420 --> 38:30.060
 Arguably, diamonds are a scam.

38:30.060 --> 38:35.060
 Because they became popular as a thing in marriage

38:37.500 --> 38:39.060
 after gold was banned,

38:39.060 --> 38:41.780
 after gold ownership was banned in the US in the 1930s

38:41.780 --> 38:43.460
 and in many places around the world.

38:43.460 --> 38:44.900
 So before that, you'd give gold.

38:44.900 --> 38:49.380
 And the reason you'd give gold in a dowry, in a wedding

38:49.380 --> 38:52.500
 is because it wasn't just that it's pretty and shiny,

38:52.500 --> 38:53.700
 it's because it's money.

38:53.700 --> 38:58.060
 And so if you die, your wife can take the gold

38:58.060 --> 39:00.460
 and she can live off of it.

39:00.460 --> 39:01.860
 It's a demonstration that you're giving her

39:01.860 --> 39:03.180
 something valuable.

39:03.180 --> 39:05.820
 And that's because nobody can make a lot more gold.

39:05.820 --> 39:07.140
 It has the high stock to flow ratio.

39:07.140 --> 39:09.700
 But then they banned gold ownership,

39:09.700 --> 39:11.100
 or they allowed people to only own

39:11.100 --> 39:12.780
 very tiny quantities of gold.

39:12.780 --> 39:15.420
 And that's when the diamond industry stepped in

39:15.420 --> 39:19.940
 and marketed diamonds as the thing that you need to give.

39:19.940 --> 39:21.500
 But the problem with it is, of course,

39:21.500 --> 39:23.780
 that the diamonds aren't like gold.

39:23.780 --> 39:27.100
 They're not very hard to make more of.

39:27.100 --> 39:29.700
 And the reason we have scarcity in diamonds

39:29.700 --> 39:30.580
 is really artificial.

39:30.580 --> 39:34.420
 There's effectively a monopoly of diamond producers.

39:34.420 --> 39:36.580
 They restrict the supply.

39:36.580 --> 39:39.060
 And it's a pretty dirty business.

39:39.060 --> 39:40.300
 And the way that they do it is,

39:40.300 --> 39:44.140
 all of the talk about blood diamonds

39:44.140 --> 39:46.300
 is a way for them to ensure their monopoly.

39:46.300 --> 39:51.180
 So if you're part of the monopoly of diamond producers,

39:51.180 --> 39:53.340
 then it doesn't matter how many people get killed

39:53.340 --> 39:54.420
 producing your diamonds.

39:54.420 --> 39:55.860
 If you're out of the monopoly,

39:55.860 --> 39:58.620
 then human rights organizations descend on you

39:58.620 --> 40:02.180
 and call for shutting you down for selling blood diamonds.

40:02.180 --> 40:03.180
 And they're also restricting

40:03.180 --> 40:04.460
 the production of artificial diamonds.

40:04.460 --> 40:05.300
 This is the other thing.

40:05.300 --> 40:06.420
 You can make artificial diamond,

40:06.420 --> 40:08.420
 you can't make artificial gold.

40:08.420 --> 40:11.060
 So they restrict the production of artificial diamond

40:11.060 --> 40:13.500
 and they try and insist that, you know,

40:13.500 --> 40:15.420
 you shouldn't take artificial diamonds,

40:15.420 --> 40:18.820
 but they're indistinguishable from real diamonds.

40:18.820 --> 40:20.340
 So it's an artificial scarcity.

40:20.340 --> 40:22.140
 And I think there's gonna come a point at some point

40:22.140 --> 40:23.380
 that this monopoly is gonna break.

40:23.380 --> 40:27.180
 And a lot of people are gonna be left with essentially

40:28.460 --> 40:30.540
 highly devalued jewelry.

40:30.540 --> 40:32.780
 I'm gonna take this segment of the podcast,

40:32.780 --> 40:34.580
 when I'm getting married, when the sun's up,

40:34.580 --> 40:38.660
 and then instead you're getting water or Bitcoin.

40:38.660 --> 40:40.660
 Yes, water and Bitcoin is all you need.

40:40.660 --> 40:44.140
 So marginal analysis, focusing on the margin

40:44.140 --> 40:45.380
 is the thing that allows you

40:45.380 --> 40:47.900
 to most accurately capture human nature,

40:47.900 --> 40:50.820
 the actual day to day decisions that we humans make.

40:50.820 --> 40:55.620
 Yeah, that's really revolutionized economics, so 1870.

40:55.620 --> 40:59.180
 And that was Menger's work.

40:59.180 --> 41:02.580
 And then he had a student, Eugen Bomberg,

41:02.580 --> 41:05.020
 who developed capital theory.

41:05.020 --> 41:07.060
 And then he had a student, Ludwig von Mises,

41:07.060 --> 41:10.620
 who is arguably the most important economist ever.

41:10.620 --> 41:12.620
 And he developed theory of money.

41:12.620 --> 41:14.980
 And he wrote a book in 1912

41:14.980 --> 41:17.420
 called The Theory of Money and Credit.

41:17.420 --> 41:20.180
 And then in the 40s, he wrote Human Action,

41:20.180 --> 41:23.300
 which is a big treatise on economics.

41:23.300 --> 41:27.340
 And I think this is the correct tradition of economics.

41:27.340 --> 41:32.340
 And before World War I, this was just known as economics.

41:32.340 --> 41:35.580
 And then after what happened in World War I,

41:35.580 --> 41:37.740
 and I discussed this in detail in the Fiat Standard,

41:37.740 --> 41:42.220
 is that the Bank of England essentially went off gold

41:42.220 --> 41:45.220
 and tried to pass off their own credit

41:45.220 --> 41:49.780
 as being as good as gold in order to finance the war.

41:49.780 --> 41:51.380
 And incidentally here,

41:51.380 --> 41:54.060
 this is part of the history that is not discussed often.

41:54.060 --> 41:56.340
 This is presented as an innovation.

41:57.340 --> 42:00.860
 Later on, they needed essentially a propaganda school

42:00.860 --> 42:03.260
 that would justify what they did.

42:03.260 --> 42:05.420
 And later on, it's presented as,

42:05.420 --> 42:08.180
 oh, hey, we realized that gold was not good.

42:08.180 --> 42:10.700
 And now look, we've built this thing

42:10.700 --> 42:11.860
 that is better than gold,

42:11.860 --> 42:13.500
 where now the government can just print money

42:13.500 --> 42:14.380
 whenever it wants.

42:14.380 --> 42:17.980
 And now gold money is not an issue anymore,

42:17.980 --> 42:20.060
 which is extremely idiotic

42:20.060 --> 42:22.140
 because the whole point of money

42:22.140 --> 42:23.380
 is that it's not easy to make.

42:23.380 --> 42:24.900
 If it's easy to make, it's not money anymore.

42:24.900 --> 42:27.500
 It's just destroying the entire function of money.

42:27.500 --> 42:28.980
 And we've seen that happen extensively

42:28.980 --> 42:30.380
 in the 20th century

42:30.380 --> 42:32.860
 after countries went off the gold standard.

42:32.860 --> 42:35.060
 So essentially Keynesian economics

42:35.060 --> 42:36.660
 is just inflation apologia.

42:36.660 --> 42:39.940
 It's just propaganda to justify inflationism.

42:39.940 --> 42:43.180
 And it's profoundly nonsensical.

42:43.180 --> 42:47.220
 It's built on the idea that if you just make more money,

42:47.220 --> 42:49.460
 you can stimulate economic production.

42:49.460 --> 42:51.420
 And of course, this is very self serving

42:51.420 --> 42:53.180
 to the central banks and to the banks

42:53.180 --> 42:56.260
 and to the governments who promote this nonsense.

42:56.260 --> 42:58.700
 And this is also very pervasive.

42:58.700 --> 43:01.300
 If you've had the misfortune of studying at a university

43:01.300 --> 43:02.740
 over the last century,

43:02.740 --> 43:04.860
 you were taught Keynesian garbage economics.

43:04.860 --> 43:09.020
 You were taught that if there's a problem in the economy,

43:09.020 --> 43:11.580
 the way to fix it is that the government prints money,

43:11.580 --> 43:13.420
 the government lowers the interest rate,

43:13.420 --> 43:17.300
 and then that leads to more economic production,

43:17.300 --> 43:18.860
 which is completely nonsensical.

43:18.860 --> 43:23.460
 So you're, again, for the listener,

43:23.460 --> 43:26.220
 you're using strong words, you know, push back

43:26.220 --> 43:30.420
 just to find, to please devil's advocate

43:30.420 --> 43:33.380
 to hopefully one day arrive at the truth.

43:33.380 --> 43:37.020
 So just because it's in the interest

43:37.020 --> 43:38.980
 of the central banks and the government,

43:38.980 --> 43:43.860
 the interests and the models of Keynesian economics

43:43.860 --> 43:47.460
 and the government are aligned doesn't mean they're wrong.

43:47.460 --> 43:49.860
 So let's give them a chance.

43:49.860 --> 43:54.260
 So the conventional wisdom, perhaps economics wisdom,

43:54.260 --> 43:58.420
 is that inflation is good in moderation

43:58.420 --> 44:00.060
 as it encourages spending,

44:00.060 --> 44:03.720
 but too much is bad because it completely devalues,

44:03.720 --> 44:05.260
 destroys people's savings.

44:05.260 --> 44:09.080
 So a little bit of inflation is good to stimulate spending.

44:09.080 --> 44:13.160
 And I mean, I suppose this is one of the things

44:13.160 --> 44:17.100
 that's supported by Keynesian economics.

44:17.100 --> 44:17.940
 Why is that wrong?

44:17.940 --> 44:19.620
 This is basically the whole point of Keynesian economics,

44:19.620 --> 44:23.420
 is to try and find an endless array of explanations

44:23.420 --> 44:25.780
 to explain why inflation is a good thing.

44:25.780 --> 44:28.340
 Well, the chicken and the egg.

44:28.340 --> 44:30.540
 So that's the cynical take.

44:30.540 --> 44:32.000
 This is a propaganda machine

44:32.000 --> 44:34.060
 to sell the government's narrative.

44:34.060 --> 44:36.860
 The less cynical take is there's a bunch of economists

44:36.860 --> 44:38.900
 who are telling, who...

44:38.900 --> 44:39.820
 Who figured out this thing

44:39.820 --> 44:42.380
 and it happens to be good for banks and governments.

44:42.380 --> 44:43.860
 Just because it's good for them doesn't mean...

44:43.860 --> 44:45.980
 And it justifies the existence of government

44:45.980 --> 44:50.620
 and your basic, I don't think it's your basic assumption,

44:50.620 --> 44:53.660
 but a foundational principle of your thought

44:53.660 --> 44:56.660
 is that a lot of government is not a good thing.

44:56.660 --> 45:00.440
 Your first gut instinct, government bad.

45:00.440 --> 45:02.940
 Like I mentioned, I live next door to Michael Malice,

45:02.940 --> 45:07.140
 who probably beats you on the intensity

45:07.140 --> 45:10.060
 and how quickly he says government bad.

45:10.060 --> 45:15.060
 So there's a potential argument for government good.

45:16.380 --> 45:17.460
 Some government is good.

45:17.460 --> 45:19.040
 Maybe a lot of government is good.

45:19.040 --> 45:22.280
 Maybe we need a lot of centralized management

45:22.280 --> 45:23.900
 for resource allocation and so on

45:23.900 --> 45:26.940
 because we humans specialize, we're too busy and so on.

45:26.940 --> 45:30.020
 So there's an argument for that that exists.

45:30.020 --> 45:32.220
 You probably disagree with any possible argument

45:32.220 --> 45:33.260
 on that side, but anyway,

45:33.260 --> 45:36.820
 so why is that idea of Keynesian economics wrong?

45:36.820 --> 45:39.560
 I'm gonna focus for this on the money idea,

45:39.560 --> 45:42.380
 the idea that a little bit of inflation is good.

45:42.380 --> 45:46.260
 The idea here, I mean, the criticism is that

45:46.260 --> 45:48.300
 without inflation, people wouldn't spend

45:48.300 --> 45:50.940
 and then the economy would come to a grinding halt.

45:50.940 --> 45:53.220
 And that's nonsensical because people spend

45:53.220 --> 45:56.080
 not because they wanna keep this magical monster

45:56.080 --> 45:58.060
 called the economy going.

45:58.060 --> 45:59.940
 People spend because they need to consume

45:59.940 --> 46:02.600
 because that's how we live, that's how we survive.

46:02.600 --> 46:04.360
 You need to eat, you need shelter,

46:04.360 --> 46:06.540
 you need clothes to keep you warm.

46:06.540 --> 46:09.620
 And as technology advances, the capabilities

46:09.620 --> 46:14.620
 of the things that we can do with our time increases

46:14.840 --> 46:16.680
 and so we wanna buy more things.

46:16.680 --> 46:19.420
 So people buy things because people want to consume.

46:19.420 --> 46:21.780
 There's a limitless desire to consume,

46:21.780 --> 46:26.780
 that there's no shortage of reasons for people to consume,

46:26.780 --> 46:28.820
 shortage of reasons for people to consume,

46:28.820 --> 46:33.380
 whether it's food or Ferraris or private jets.

46:33.380 --> 46:35.340
 People just always wanna buy more.

46:35.340 --> 46:36.980
 Can I interrupt just really quick?

46:36.980 --> 46:40.040
 What about the fear about the uncertainty of the future

46:40.040 --> 46:45.040
 where they might want to buy things

46:45.940 --> 46:48.140
 but they're really afraid because it seems like

46:48.140 --> 46:50.340
 there's a lot like a pandemic going on or whatever it is.

46:50.340 --> 46:51.700
 Yeah, that's good.

46:51.700 --> 46:55.740
 So fear of uncertainty, can you have too much fear?

46:55.740 --> 46:57.660
 Here's the thing, what I was saying is,

46:57.660 --> 47:00.460
 I was making the point that we don't need

47:00.460 --> 47:02.140
 to be motivated to consume.

47:02.140 --> 47:05.180
 Like we have the insatiable desire to consume.

47:05.180 --> 47:08.520
 Everybody would like to have more of all kinds of things.

47:08.520 --> 47:10.420
 Everybody would like to have a bigger house.

47:10.420 --> 47:12.300
 Well, not everybody, some people have a big enough house

47:12.300 --> 47:14.220
 but everybody would like a house,

47:14.220 --> 47:18.780
 everybody would like a car, jet, all kinds of things,

47:18.780 --> 47:20.920
 electronics, machines.

47:20.920 --> 47:23.940
 So we don't need a desire to consume.

47:23.940 --> 47:26.500
 But of course the limit on how much we consume

47:26.500 --> 47:29.300
 is opportunity cost.

47:29.300 --> 47:30.820
 Why don't you buy a Ferrari?

47:30.820 --> 47:32.300
 Well, because that's really expensive

47:32.300 --> 47:35.140
 and it would mean that, well, maybe you do have a Ferrari

47:35.140 --> 47:36.860
 but I mean, most people don't buy a Ferrari

47:36.860 --> 47:39.860
 because it's too expensive, they can't afford it.

47:39.860 --> 47:41.820
 They'd have to work too hard to get it.

47:41.820 --> 47:45.100
 And if they do get it, it might mean that

47:45.100 --> 47:46.500
 they can't afford their house anymore.

47:46.500 --> 47:49.680
 So we have to economize, that's a good thing.

47:49.680 --> 47:51.920
 And we have to also think of the future.

47:51.920 --> 47:54.180
 And so humans consume,

47:54.180 --> 47:57.080
 we don't need more motivation to consume.

47:57.080 --> 47:59.500
 We have to deal with the economic reality

47:59.500 --> 48:02.980
 of the things that limit us from consuming more.

48:02.980 --> 48:06.700
 So what Keynesians present is that

48:06.700 --> 48:08.660
 when there is a problem in the economy,

48:08.660 --> 48:10.540
 like there was after World War I,

48:11.700 --> 48:16.700
 the problem is always caused by the inflation.

48:17.180 --> 48:18.860
 And what the Keynesian hucksters do

48:18.860 --> 48:21.380
 is that they look at the inflation,

48:21.380 --> 48:23.260
 at the consequences of inflation

48:23.260 --> 48:25.580
 and blame it on people not spending enough.

48:25.580 --> 48:27.340
 When people are doing the rational thing,

48:27.340 --> 48:30.500
 the money is, so there was inflation,

48:30.500 --> 48:34.380
 caused an unsustainable boom, it caused the recession.

48:34.380 --> 48:36.060
 And now a lot of people lost their jobs

48:36.060 --> 48:37.020
 and they don't have enough money

48:37.020 --> 48:39.940
 to go out and spend frivolously.

48:39.940 --> 48:42.740
 So they save for the future, the future is uncertain.

48:42.740 --> 48:46.380
 That's a good thing, that's how you fix things.

48:46.380 --> 48:49.900
 You begin the recovery by, well, you lost some wealth,

48:49.900 --> 48:52.780
 so you spend less, like if your business goes bust,

48:52.780 --> 48:56.020
 if you lose your job, it's natural and smart

48:56.020 --> 48:57.740
 that you stop spending money

48:57.740 --> 49:00.180
 on the frivolous thing that you used to spend

49:00.180 --> 49:01.500
 and you save it for the future.

49:01.500 --> 49:04.220
 You invest in something else, you get a new job.

49:04.220 --> 49:06.380
 And then once you've recovered, you start spending more.

49:06.380 --> 49:08.900
 This is very sane and very good

49:08.900 --> 49:11.300
 and it's the way to recovery.

49:11.300 --> 49:14.660
 But essentially the Keynesians have used this

49:14.660 --> 49:17.460
 as a justification for more inflation

49:17.460 --> 49:19.340
 because inflation is an addiction.

49:19.340 --> 49:21.300
 Once the government gets down the path

49:21.300 --> 49:23.780
 of spending money to solve its problems,

49:23.780 --> 49:26.860
 then every problem looks like it can be solved

49:26.860 --> 49:27.820
 by more inflation.

49:27.820 --> 49:31.420
 And so this is where Keynesian economics comes in.

49:31.420 --> 49:33.300
 And of course, the Keynesian economics

49:34.220 --> 49:38.980
 is based on the work of Keynes, which came in the 1930s.

49:38.980 --> 49:40.100
 And this is the key point,

49:40.100 --> 49:42.740
 like it's portrayed in the textbook

49:42.740 --> 49:46.620
 as if it's just the scientific breakthrough

49:46.620 --> 49:49.300
 that somebody in the 1930s, this genius,

49:49.300 --> 49:50.860
 came about and realized that,

49:50.860 --> 49:53.260
 oh, we don't actually need gold.

49:53.260 --> 49:54.260
 We don't need hard money.

49:54.260 --> 49:56.620
 We can actually just print all the money.

49:56.620 --> 50:00.620
 And in reality, of course, it was just the very thin,

50:00.620 --> 50:02.500
 flimsy, idiotic justification

50:02.500 --> 50:05.100
 for what governments were already doing for 20 years.

50:05.100 --> 50:07.580
 They'd already gone off the gold standard

50:07.580 --> 50:09.900
 and they'd gone through 20 years

50:09.900 --> 50:11.900
 in which they were lying to their population,

50:11.900 --> 50:14.020
 telling their population we're still on a gold standard,

50:14.020 --> 50:18.460
 but there are problems caused by various random things.

50:18.460 --> 50:20.100
 But don't worry, we're gonna be going back

50:20.100 --> 50:20.940
 on the gold standard.

50:20.940 --> 50:23.980
 20 years later, after they went off the gold standard,

50:23.980 --> 50:27.060
 they come up with this justification for why,

50:27.060 --> 50:29.860
 oh, actually the gold standard was bad.

50:29.860 --> 50:32.900
 And this is a really pernicious thing about it is

50:32.900 --> 50:34.500
 the problems that were caused by us

50:34.500 --> 50:36.380
 going off the gold standard

50:36.380 --> 50:39.020
 were caused by the gold standard.

50:39.020 --> 50:40.620
 And we're going to fix them

50:40.620 --> 50:42.820
 by going off the gold standard even more.

50:42.820 --> 50:45.900
 Just because government is lying and it's shady

50:45.900 --> 50:47.220
 and it does these kinds of things

50:47.220 --> 50:49.660
 doesn't mean Keynesian economics is wrong.

50:49.660 --> 50:53.100
 So just, because I wanted to separate a few things you said.

50:53.100 --> 50:55.260
 It could very well be very wrong

50:55.260 --> 50:57.020
 and they could indeed be hucksters.

50:57.020 --> 51:00.820
 All of these, such colorful language.

51:00.820 --> 51:03.260
 I love you deeply for this, this is fun.

51:03.260 --> 51:05.300
 Yeah, but I mean, it's like somebody like Krugman

51:05.300 --> 51:07.940
 doesn't use this kind of language when discussing Austrians.

51:07.940 --> 51:10.700
 It's just that when actors like him use it,

51:10.700 --> 51:13.220
 it's presented as if it is legitimate

51:13.220 --> 51:15.620
 because he's part of the major shows.

51:15.620 --> 51:20.620
 So the case they make and the criticism Keynesians make

51:22.100 --> 51:24.820
 of Austrian economics and the case they make

51:24.820 --> 51:28.180
 for Keynesian economics is it's based on empirical evidence.

51:28.180 --> 51:33.180
 So Austrian economists are pie in the sky theorists

51:33.660 --> 51:37.340
 about like how human nature works.

51:37.340 --> 51:39.460
 And it's just all theory.

51:39.460 --> 51:41.540
 And just like you said, Keynesian economics

51:41.540 --> 51:44.780
 kind of sell it as a science, data driven science.

51:44.780 --> 51:49.100
 And so where's the data, bro?

51:50.580 --> 51:55.580
 So one way of saying it is how do you know

51:55.660 --> 51:57.980
 if we get rid of inflation?

51:57.980 --> 52:00.020
 How do you know if we get rid of central banks?

52:00.020 --> 52:01.740
 If we push towards that direction,

52:02.620 --> 52:06.740
 we will have a better world, a better functioning economy,

52:06.740 --> 52:10.900
 better functioning markets, better functioning society.

52:10.900 --> 52:14.620
 This is another inaccurate way in which they present.

52:14.620 --> 52:16.620
 The economics, they present as if it's just theory

52:16.620 --> 52:19.780
 and that the data doesn't matter, but that's not the case.

52:19.780 --> 52:23.140
 What the Austrians say is that without guiding theory,

52:23.140 --> 52:26.460
 data is mute, data is dumb, data can't say anything.

52:26.460 --> 52:31.180
 So theory first, and then you have to have models

52:32.620 --> 52:35.940
 to provide context for interpretation of the data.

52:35.940 --> 52:38.780
 And it's a sign of just how little self awareness they have

52:38.780 --> 52:42.260
 that they think that they're just being led by the data

52:42.260 --> 52:46.460
 when they're being led by Keynes's moronic theories.

52:47.300 --> 52:50.900
 And they use the data to justify those theories

52:50.900 --> 52:52.380
 and to stick by them.

52:52.380 --> 52:54.980
 And in fact, they are the ones whose theories

52:54.980 --> 52:58.460
 cannot be refuted because it's just

52:58.460 --> 53:00.380
 government mandated religion.

53:00.380 --> 53:03.060
 So according to Keynes's nonsense,

53:06.100 --> 53:10.660
 so the way that they justify the inflationism is this,

53:10.660 --> 53:12.380
 and I'm just using this to give an example

53:12.380 --> 53:14.580
 of what you're talking about in terms of theory,

53:14.580 --> 53:15.980
 the way they justify the inflationism

53:15.980 --> 53:17.780
 to tie it back to the original point,

53:17.780 --> 53:20.100
 they justified it, all right, we need money to spend.

53:20.100 --> 53:22.140
 And then the level of spending in the economy

53:22.140 --> 53:23.700
 is what determines the state of the economy.

53:23.700 --> 53:25.140
 And I've taught macro economics

53:25.140 --> 53:26.460
 at university level for a while.

53:26.460 --> 53:31.300
 So I know Keynesian nonsense better than most Keynesians

53:31.300 --> 53:34.260
 know Austrians, if not all of them, I guarantee you.

53:34.260 --> 53:38.180
 And so the way they see it is the level of spending

53:38.180 --> 53:40.380
 in the economy is what determines the state of the economy.

53:40.380 --> 53:42.660
 There's a level of output and there's a level of spending.

53:42.660 --> 53:44.420
 So there's like the factories on the one side

53:44.420 --> 53:45.940
 that are churning out goods,

53:45.940 --> 53:48.740
 and those goods have a certain quantity and value,

53:48.740 --> 53:51.660
 market value, and it's completely nonsensical of course,

53:51.660 --> 53:54.820
 because how can the value of the goods produced

53:54.820 --> 53:56.660
 be different from the value of the spending?

53:56.660 --> 53:59.020
 But let's put that aside for a second.

54:00.060 --> 54:02.420
 So the amount of spending that happens in the economy

54:02.420 --> 54:04.100
 determines the state of the economy.

54:04.100 --> 54:07.820
 If the value of the production, which they call Y

54:07.820 --> 54:10.340
 is higher than the aggregate expenditures,

54:10.340 --> 54:11.300
 so this is the production

54:11.300 --> 54:13.420
 and then the aggregate expenditure is lower,

54:13.420 --> 54:16.700
 then we don't have enough spending to buy all the goods.

54:16.700 --> 54:18.220
 And then that causes a recession.

54:18.220 --> 54:20.740
 The factories start laying off workers

54:20.740 --> 54:23.300
 and then the laid off workers start spending less.

54:23.300 --> 54:25.500
 And then that leads to aggregate expenditure

54:25.500 --> 54:26.940
 dropping even further.

54:26.940 --> 54:28.300
 And so it's a vicious cycle

54:28.300 --> 54:30.540
 where the economy gets into recession.

54:30.540 --> 54:33.980
 And the only way out is for Keynes's bankster buddies

54:33.980 --> 54:36.060
 and government buddies to print a lot of money

54:36.060 --> 54:37.460
 to give to themselves.

54:37.460 --> 54:39.460
 And then that will...

54:39.460 --> 54:40.740
 That's one interpretation.

54:40.740 --> 54:44.900
 But to print more money to increase the expenditure

54:44.900 --> 54:46.260
 that to match the supply.

54:46.260 --> 54:47.380
 To match the level of output.

54:47.380 --> 54:49.180
 Sounds pretty good to me, I'm sold.

54:49.180 --> 54:50.820
 All right.

54:50.820 --> 54:52.620
 Even though you're saying huckster, so.

54:52.620 --> 54:53.460
 Yes.

54:53.460 --> 54:56.500
 I just, you know, the way, I love you very much,

54:56.500 --> 54:59.660
 but like just for people who are listening,

54:59.660 --> 55:03.700
 I think it's, I love the way you talk and it's great

55:03.700 --> 55:05.900
 and keep doing it, but just for context,

55:05.900 --> 55:10.860
 like I don't know anything that involves human nature

55:10.860 --> 55:12.460
 deserves this level of certainty.

55:12.460 --> 55:15.300
 I, at least my position is that we don't know

55:15.300 --> 55:18.180
 what the hell we're doing on basically anything.

55:18.180 --> 55:19.300
 Perhaps, but I mean.

55:19.300 --> 55:23.740
 Like there's a lot, like certainty can get us in trouble

55:23.740 --> 55:24.580
 is my worry.

55:24.580 --> 55:27.180
 I don't know much about economics.

55:27.180 --> 55:29.500
 I don't even know, you know, financial systems,

55:29.500 --> 55:33.980
 monetary systems, but I just seen us get in trouble

55:33.980 --> 55:36.260
 with human psychology, certainty,

55:36.260 --> 55:38.380
 certainty of ideologies in general.

55:38.380 --> 55:40.340
 You mentioned Marxism and so on.

55:40.340 --> 55:42.180
 I came from the Soviet Union.

55:42.180 --> 55:44.460
 There's a lot of people that are very certain

55:44.460 --> 55:46.580
 throughout the history of the 20th century

55:46.580 --> 55:51.580
 that communism is the utopia that humanity should strive for.

55:52.540 --> 55:54.380
 So I'm nervous around certainty.

55:54.380 --> 55:57.220
 I could be wrong, but you know, you ask me for my opinion.

55:57.220 --> 55:58.060
 Yes, yes.

55:58.060 --> 56:00.220
 Sorry, so it's that little bit of a caveat.

56:00.220 --> 56:03.180
 So to go back to the idea, then on the other hand,

56:03.180 --> 56:05.980
 you have the level of, if the other situation

56:05.980 --> 56:07.740
 is when the level of spending is higher

56:07.740 --> 56:09.980
 than the amount of aggregate output.

56:09.980 --> 56:11.780
 In that situation, you have too much spending.

56:11.780 --> 56:14.580
 So therefore what ends up happening is inflation.

56:14.580 --> 56:16.100
 So according to the Keynesian worldview,

56:16.100 --> 56:18.220
 this is really important because this is a way

56:18.220 --> 56:20.900
 that I'm gonna get to your point about empirical data

56:20.900 --> 56:25.900
 and to show you why they're not correct.

56:26.540 --> 56:28.300
 Yeah, they're not correct about what they say

56:28.300 --> 56:29.580
 about empirical data.

56:29.580 --> 56:32.580
 So then what this means is that there's a level of output

56:32.580 --> 56:34.180
 and there's a level of aggregate expenditure.

56:34.180 --> 56:36.060
 The aggregate expenditure can either be higher

56:36.060 --> 56:38.620
 or lower than the output or equal to it.

56:38.620 --> 56:41.700
 If it's higher, we get inflation.

56:41.700 --> 56:46.620
 If it's lower, we get recessions, okay?

56:46.620 --> 56:50.020
 So is there any universe in this model?

56:50.020 --> 56:52.180
 Is there any potential universe

56:52.180 --> 56:56.300
 in which you can have both inflation and a recession?

56:56.300 --> 56:59.380
 According to the Keynesian model, you can't, right?

56:59.380 --> 57:02.700
 Because aggregate expenditure cannot be both higher

57:02.700 --> 57:04.980
 and lower than output.

57:04.980 --> 57:08.460
 So therefore, if you were truly being an empirical person,

57:08.460 --> 57:13.140
 if you were looking at evidence and trying to analyze data,

57:13.140 --> 57:16.380
 you'd look at this and say, one example,

57:16.380 --> 57:18.740
 you just need one example of high inflation

57:18.740 --> 57:23.700
 and high unemployment to refute this entire model, right?

57:23.700 --> 57:25.980
 And of course, the world is full of examples

57:25.980 --> 57:28.140
 of high inflation and high unemployment.

57:28.140 --> 57:30.020
 And that's what happened in the 19, and of course,

57:30.020 --> 57:32.260
 they ignored it when it happens in poor countries

57:32.260 --> 57:34.500
 because poor countries don't really matter.

57:34.500 --> 57:37.180
 But then in the 1970s, that happened in the US

57:37.180 --> 57:38.260
 and in the Western economies

57:38.260 --> 57:40.380
 and the most advanced industrial economies.

57:40.380 --> 57:42.460
 So historically, before then,

57:42.460 --> 57:45.700
 you had all these Keynesian central bankers

57:47.180 --> 57:48.980
 talking about this model and saying,

57:48.980 --> 57:51.060
 well, aggregate expenditure is too low now

57:51.060 --> 57:52.420
 and that's why we have unemployment.

57:52.420 --> 57:53.580
 So we need to print more money.

57:53.580 --> 57:56.500
 And then they print more money, inflation goes up,

57:56.500 --> 58:01.500
 but also unemployment goes up because this model is broken.

58:01.860 --> 58:04.300
 That's not how the world works.

58:04.300 --> 58:06.300
 The level of aggregate spending in the economy

58:06.300 --> 58:09.020
 is not a lever with which you can control

58:09.020 --> 58:10.820
 inflation and unemployment.

58:10.820 --> 58:12.900
 So what would a scientist do?

58:12.900 --> 58:15.380
 What would a non Huckster do in this case?

58:17.300 --> 58:18.660
 Admit the theory is wrong

58:18.660 --> 58:21.260
 and find another way to reformulate it.

58:21.260 --> 58:23.020
 Have the Keynesians done that?

58:23.020 --> 58:25.540
 No, still the same garbage in the textbook

58:25.540 --> 58:27.140
 that is being taught until today.

58:27.140 --> 58:29.700
 So is it possible to have a non Keynesian model

58:29.700 --> 58:31.980
 where one that still supports

58:31.980 --> 58:34.580
 moderate amount of inflation is good for the economy?

58:34.580 --> 58:37.060
 I mean, since the 1970s, since this has happened,

58:37.060 --> 58:42.060
 yeah, this is what basically most fiat economists,

58:43.220 --> 58:44.060
 as I like to call them,

58:44.060 --> 58:46.540
 essentially anybody at a university financed by governments,

58:46.540 --> 58:47.860
 which is financed by central banks,

58:47.860 --> 58:48.700
 which is financed by fiat.

58:48.700 --> 58:50.060
 Oh, we'll talk about that.

58:50.060 --> 58:53.860
 The effect of fiat money on our life,

58:53.860 --> 58:56.100
 as you write about in your book,

58:56.100 --> 58:58.460
 fiat standard, one of them is education.

58:58.460 --> 59:00.220
 I'm sure we'll disagree there too.

59:01.220 --> 59:04.020
 Not smart enough to disagree, but I'll disagree anyway.

59:04.020 --> 59:06.220
 So yeah, so a whole bunch of other models came up,

59:06.220 --> 59:10.660
 but basically it's such an example of motivated reasoning.

59:10.660 --> 59:12.260
 Like anybody who's got a familiarity

59:12.260 --> 59:13.380
 with the scientific method

59:13.380 --> 59:14.900
 or who's got an engineering background

59:14.900 --> 59:18.580
 who comes into economics immediately has a lot of red flags.

59:18.580 --> 59:22.340
 And I remember when I used to teach macro economics,

59:22.340 --> 59:24.500
 I used to teach introductory macro economics.

59:24.500 --> 59:26.580
 And it's a course that would be taken by econ majors

59:26.580 --> 59:27.660
 as well as engineers.

59:27.660 --> 59:29.620
 A lot of engineers would take it as an elective.

59:29.620 --> 59:31.060
 And every time I'd explain,

59:31.060 --> 59:33.260
 and I would just teach the Keynesian basic stuff.

59:33.260 --> 59:34.180
 And every time I'd explain it,

59:34.180 --> 59:35.980
 there's always that smart engineering kid

59:35.980 --> 59:37.980
 who just looks at me and says,

59:37.980 --> 59:39.620
 sir, this doesn't make any sense

59:39.620 --> 59:41.260
 because this and this and that.

59:41.260 --> 59:43.780
 And I'm always like, you get it exactly.

59:43.780 --> 59:44.700
 You're correct.

59:44.700 --> 59:47.580
 Because if you have any kind of shred of scientific thinking,

59:47.580 --> 59:50.220
 you see that this is all motivated reasoning.

59:50.220 --> 59:52.820
 Like the answer is government needs to print money.

59:52.820 --> 59:56.740
 And here's a whole bunch of models brought up by people

59:56.740 --> 59:59.100
 for why government printing money is good.

59:59.100 --> 1:00:01.940
 And the reason they're coming up to this conclusion

1:00:01.940 --> 1:00:03.060
 is that you only get funded

1:00:03.060 --> 1:00:04.340
 if you come up with this conclusion.

1:00:04.340 --> 1:00:05.260
 If you come up with a conclusion

1:00:05.260 --> 1:00:08.260
 that we need to shut down the central bank,

1:00:08.260 --> 1:00:10.100
 you don't get funded by the central bank.

1:00:10.100 --> 1:00:11.620
 You don't get published in the journals.

1:00:11.620 --> 1:00:14.540
 You don't get a job at the prestigious universities.

1:00:14.540 --> 1:00:16.980
 You don't get quoted by a fiat publications

1:00:16.980 --> 1:00:18.820
 like the New York Times and CNN.

1:00:18.820 --> 1:00:21.340
 They don't invite you on as an expert.

1:00:21.340 --> 1:00:22.540
 Well, that's a fundamental flaw

1:00:22.540 --> 1:00:24.580
 with a lot of institutions we have today

1:00:25.660 --> 1:00:26.980
 and throughout human history.

1:00:26.980 --> 1:00:29.500
 Let me zoom off for just a second to the big question.

1:00:29.500 --> 1:00:32.420
 What is economics in general?

1:00:32.420 --> 1:00:33.260
 What's the goal?

1:00:33.260 --> 1:00:34.940
 You said there's a bunch of models.

1:00:34.940 --> 1:00:38.180
 Is any economist basically trying to throw a bunch of models

1:00:38.180 --> 1:00:40.060
 about human behavior on the table

1:00:40.060 --> 1:00:43.940
 and try to generalize it to the global scale?

1:00:43.940 --> 1:00:47.060
 So both dance between micro and macro somehow

1:00:47.060 --> 1:00:49.180
 in order to determine public policy

1:00:49.180 --> 1:00:53.100
 and explain the past, predict the future,

1:00:53.100 --> 1:00:56.940
 prescribe policies that can control the future,

1:00:56.940 --> 1:00:57.900
 those kinds of things.

1:00:57.900 --> 1:01:00.140
 This is the big basic ridiculous question

1:01:00.140 --> 1:01:02.060
 of what is economics?

1:01:02.060 --> 1:01:03.300
 Economics is the study,

1:01:03.300 --> 1:01:05.380
 the way the Austrians define it is the study

1:01:05.380 --> 1:01:09.100
 of how humans make choices under the condition of scarcity.

1:01:09.100 --> 1:01:11.020
 We begin with the starting point of economics

1:01:11.020 --> 1:01:14.100
 as the fact that scarcity exists.

1:01:14.100 --> 1:01:16.500
 And why does scarcity exist?

1:01:16.500 --> 1:01:18.380
 Well, because it's easier to want things

1:01:18.380 --> 1:01:19.460
 than it is to make them.

1:01:19.460 --> 1:01:23.300
 It's much easier to want a Ferrari than it is to make one.

1:01:23.300 --> 1:01:27.620
 And so because we have wants

1:01:27.620 --> 1:01:30.980
 and we have limited means to meet those wants,

1:01:30.980 --> 1:01:32.260
 we need to economize.

1:01:32.260 --> 1:01:37.220
 It's a permanent marker of the human condition.

1:01:37.220 --> 1:01:39.980
 We are always economizing at all times.

1:01:39.980 --> 1:01:43.060
 And so how people make those decisions

1:01:43.060 --> 1:01:45.340
 under the conditions of scarcity

1:01:45.340 --> 1:01:47.500
 is what economists study.

1:01:47.500 --> 1:01:49.900
 So to go back to your point on empiricism

1:01:49.900 --> 1:01:51.340
 in Austrian school,

1:01:51.340 --> 1:01:55.660
 so it isn't that the Austrians don't believe in data.

1:01:55.660 --> 1:02:00.500
 On the contrary, it's that theory has to inform data.

1:02:00.500 --> 1:02:02.460
 And in fact, if you think about it

1:02:02.460 --> 1:02:06.660
 as the example of the stagflation of the 1970 shows,

1:02:08.180 --> 1:02:10.620
 if you have stagflation,

1:02:10.620 --> 1:02:13.460
 that just completely refutes the Keynesian model.

1:02:13.460 --> 1:02:15.500
 The Austrian way of thinking,

1:02:15.500 --> 1:02:17.860
 which is think from first principles,

1:02:17.860 --> 1:02:19.860
 understand how the world actually works,

1:02:19.860 --> 1:02:21.980
 think about how humans act and understand

1:02:21.980 --> 1:02:23.940
 that economics is really all about human action.

1:02:23.940 --> 1:02:26.620
 So it's not about aggregates of goods.

1:02:26.620 --> 1:02:28.020
 This is really the key distinction

1:02:28.020 --> 1:02:29.500
 in terms of methodology.

1:02:29.500 --> 1:02:32.820
 For the Keynesians, it's physics envy.

1:02:32.820 --> 1:02:34.340
 They look at the market economy,

1:02:34.340 --> 1:02:36.700
 they look at individuals in the market economy,

1:02:36.700 --> 1:02:39.220
 and they think that they can understand the market economy

1:02:39.220 --> 1:02:40.780
 by looking at aggregates.

1:02:40.780 --> 1:02:43.460
 This is really the key point of what I think

1:02:43.460 --> 1:02:48.060
 makes a certain branch of economics pseudoscientific

1:02:48.060 --> 1:02:49.780
 is the introduction of aggregates.

1:02:49.780 --> 1:02:52.500
 When you introduce those aggregates,

1:02:52.500 --> 1:02:54.460
 how much production takes place,

1:02:54.460 --> 1:02:56.580
 how many people are unemployed,

1:02:56.580 --> 1:02:59.580
 the percentage of the inflation rate,

1:02:59.580 --> 1:03:01.540
 and then you think that you can establish

1:03:01.540 --> 1:03:04.860
 scientific relationship between those aggregates,

1:03:04.860 --> 1:03:07.500
 it's purely physics envy.

1:03:07.500 --> 1:03:09.980
 In physics, for instance, or in chemistry,

1:03:09.980 --> 1:03:13.900
 you put, let's say, a container that contains a gas,

1:03:13.900 --> 1:03:18.380
 and you have the ideal gas law, PV equals to nRT,

1:03:18.380 --> 1:03:20.940
 calculate the pressure, calculate the volume,

1:03:20.940 --> 1:03:24.380
 and then the temperature.

1:03:24.380 --> 1:03:25.620
 If you have the pressure and the volume,

1:03:25.620 --> 1:03:26.620
 you can calculate the temperature

1:03:26.620 --> 1:03:30.060
 because you have the nR constants.

1:03:30.060 --> 1:03:32.740
 So there's a clear relationship

1:03:32.740 --> 1:03:34.620
 that has been demonstrated in a laboratory

1:03:34.620 --> 1:03:36.620
 and that we can do it right now.

1:03:36.620 --> 1:03:38.260
 We can measure it and we can see it

1:03:38.260 --> 1:03:40.020
 and it continues to hold.

1:03:40.020 --> 1:03:42.740
 And all it takes is one scientist

1:03:42.740 --> 1:03:44.820
 to show that this relationship does not hold,

1:03:44.820 --> 1:03:48.020
 to do an experiment that shows that this does not hold,

1:03:48.020 --> 1:03:52.780
 and it stops being a law of chemistry and it's broken.

1:03:52.780 --> 1:03:56.380
 Whereas in economics, what they've done

1:03:56.380 --> 1:04:00.180
 is they've copied the superficial shape of this

1:04:00.180 --> 1:04:02.860
 without any of the scientific rigor

1:04:02.860 --> 1:04:04.820
 that was used to build it.

1:04:04.820 --> 1:04:05.860
 There's no experiments.

1:04:05.860 --> 1:04:08.100
 You can't experiment on economies.

1:04:08.100 --> 1:04:11.780
 We don't have the ability to establish laws,

1:04:11.780 --> 1:04:13.340
 and all the laws that we establish

1:04:13.340 --> 1:04:15.420
 are just models that get people published

1:04:15.420 --> 1:04:18.140
 and get them on the media to say,

1:04:18.140 --> 1:04:20.540
 my model says we need to print more money,

1:04:20.540 --> 1:04:23.420
 but it's never subject to actual scientific scrutiny.

1:04:23.420 --> 1:04:25.620
 If it were, they would all be rejected in 15 minutes

1:04:25.620 --> 1:04:28.180
 because the world is full of examples that contradict them.

1:04:28.180 --> 1:04:30.220
 Was it possible to do scientific scrutiny

1:04:30.220 --> 1:04:32.100
 when it's human nature when you can't,

1:04:32.100 --> 1:04:34.660
 when there's a nearly infinite number of variables

1:04:34.660 --> 1:04:36.020
 and you can't control them?

1:04:36.020 --> 1:04:38.300
 Is it possible, so what's the best thing

1:04:38.300 --> 1:04:40.180
 you could possibly do?

1:04:40.180 --> 1:04:42.180
 You do thought experiments.

1:04:43.100 --> 1:04:45.500
 But the problem with thought experiments,

1:04:46.500 --> 1:04:49.820
 Freud thinks everybody wants to have sex with their mother.

1:04:49.820 --> 1:04:51.780
 Is he right? That's the problem with Freud.

1:04:51.780 --> 1:04:53.780
 I don't know, maybe he's right.

1:04:53.780 --> 1:04:57.020
 Well, obviously I'm joking on that front, but the...

1:04:57.020 --> 1:04:59.020
 Freud is probably under the canes.

1:05:00.300 --> 1:05:03.660
 Well, no, I think there's power to the thought experiment.

1:05:03.660 --> 1:05:06.420
 Just like Einstein, a lot of general relativity,

1:05:06.420 --> 1:05:09.300
 special relativity, that's a thought experiment.

1:05:09.300 --> 1:05:10.860
 It originates in a thought experiment.

1:05:10.860 --> 1:05:12.080
 Now, is it true?

1:05:13.460 --> 1:05:14.660
 Nice thing about physics,

1:05:14.660 --> 1:05:17.420
 you can't eventually have experimental validation.

1:05:17.420 --> 1:05:20.860
 The downside of economics is you really can't have

1:05:20.860 --> 1:05:25.660
 experimental, definitive experimental scientific rigor

1:05:25.660 --> 1:05:27.060
 of validation of a theory.

1:05:27.060 --> 1:05:29.140
 So a thought experiment is just a thought experiment.

1:05:29.140 --> 1:05:32.740
 Using your intuition, it's the power of reasoning together

1:05:32.740 --> 1:05:33.700
 about human nature.

1:05:33.700 --> 1:05:36.540
 And that's why economics cannot make the claims

1:05:36.540 --> 1:05:37.380
 that physics can make.

1:05:37.380 --> 1:05:40.700
 So with physics, you can predict that if you get this gas

1:05:40.700 --> 1:05:42.320
 at this pressure, at this volume,

1:05:42.320 --> 1:05:43.980
 the temperature will be that much.

1:05:43.980 --> 1:05:47.840
 And you can make that prediction and test it a million times

1:05:47.840 --> 1:05:50.340
 and you'll always get the precisely correct answer.

1:05:50.340 --> 1:05:53.060
 With economics, we can't make quantitative predictions.

1:05:53.060 --> 1:05:54.860
 But still, on Twitter, and even today,

1:05:54.860 --> 1:05:57.820
 you're very certain about the statements you're making.

1:05:57.820 --> 1:05:58.660
 Do you...

1:05:58.660 --> 1:06:00.480
 Yeah, but I don't make quantitatively certain statements.

1:06:00.480 --> 1:06:01.320
 That's the thing.

1:06:01.320 --> 1:06:03.380
 In economics, we don't make quantitative predictions.

1:06:03.380 --> 1:06:06.140
 We cannot do that because we don't have experiments.

1:06:06.140 --> 1:06:09.620
 But we can understand how the world actually works

1:06:09.620 --> 1:06:10.460
 with humility.

1:06:10.460 --> 1:06:11.660
 This is really the key difference

1:06:11.660 --> 1:06:13.940
 that the Keynesians think they just wanna copy

1:06:13.940 --> 1:06:15.060
 the methods of physics.

1:06:15.060 --> 1:06:18.480
 And then that's just gonna give them the certainty

1:06:18.480 --> 1:06:20.340
 of the results of physics, which is like me saying,

1:06:20.340 --> 1:06:23.680
 I'm just gonna put a red blanket on my back

1:06:23.680 --> 1:06:26.180
 and jump from the fourth floor because I'm Superman.

1:06:26.180 --> 1:06:27.500
 Well, it's not the red blanket

1:06:27.500 --> 1:06:29.020
 that's gonna make me Superman.

1:06:29.020 --> 1:06:30.180
 There's a lot more to it.

1:06:30.180 --> 1:06:33.500
 So humility manifests itself in economics

1:06:33.500 --> 1:06:35.580
 as the belief in a free market.

1:06:35.580 --> 1:06:37.380
 Meaning like, I can't centralize,

1:06:37.380 --> 1:06:41.180
 I can't do centralized control on this thing.

1:06:41.180 --> 1:06:44.480
 We're going to minimize the friction

1:06:44.480 --> 1:06:47.440
 of the free exchange of goods.

1:06:47.440 --> 1:06:52.260
 So Austrian economics puts priority in the market.

1:06:52.260 --> 1:06:55.660
 Yes, and you could arrive at it through two paths.

1:06:55.660 --> 1:07:00.660
 The more practical path, which most scientific minded

1:07:01.380 --> 1:07:02.260
 people arrive at.

1:07:02.260 --> 1:07:03.500
 I came from an engineering background.

1:07:03.500 --> 1:07:07.060
 So I initially had this idea that what is lacking

1:07:07.060 --> 1:07:09.180
 in economics is mathematicization.

1:07:09.180 --> 1:07:11.260
 We need to have better math models.

1:07:11.260 --> 1:07:13.120
 We need to get all of those tools from engineering,

1:07:13.120 --> 1:07:15.380
 apply them to economics, and then we'll be able

1:07:15.380 --> 1:07:18.340
 to plan the world economy and make it work better.

1:07:18.340 --> 1:07:21.180
 And then you start actually trying to solve problems,

1:07:21.180 --> 1:07:22.340
 trying to actually calculate them.

1:07:22.340 --> 1:07:24.700
 And you realize nobody can have that ability

1:07:24.700 --> 1:07:28.460
 because the difference ultimately comes down to the fact

1:07:28.460 --> 1:07:29.780
 we can't have experiments.

1:07:29.780 --> 1:07:31.780
 And the reason we can't have experiments is that

1:07:31.780 --> 1:07:33.900
 you can experiment on particles of a gas.

1:07:33.900 --> 1:07:37.440
 You can't experiment on human beings and entire economies.

1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:42.180
 And because particles of a gas are just dumb matter.

1:07:42.180 --> 1:07:46.020
 And so you kick matter in a certain way.

1:07:46.020 --> 1:07:48.780
 You can calculate exactly how much is going to fly.

1:07:48.780 --> 1:07:50.340
 Human beings are much more complex.

1:07:50.340 --> 1:07:51.660
 They have a will inside them.

1:07:51.660 --> 1:07:55.420
 And this is really, this is the humility to understand

1:07:55.420 --> 1:07:57.140
 that you are a human being and other people

1:07:57.140 --> 1:07:59.420
 are also human being just like you.

1:07:59.420 --> 1:08:03.580
 And that every person wakes up every morning

1:08:03.580 --> 1:08:06.420
 and they have a million things in their mind,

1:08:06.420 --> 1:08:07.700
 a million things they care about,

1:08:07.700 --> 1:08:09.500
 a million things they want to do.

1:08:09.500 --> 1:08:13.220
 And you will never be able to make the decisions

1:08:13.220 --> 1:08:16.660
 for somebody else, let alone for millions of other people.

1:08:16.660 --> 1:08:18.980
 So this is one path by which you arrive at the conclusion

1:08:18.980 --> 1:08:21.120
 that free markets are better because you realize

1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:22.080
 that all of the people that think

1:08:22.080 --> 1:08:24.660
 that they can centrally plan markets

1:08:24.660 --> 1:08:26.900
 can't actually do that.

1:08:26.900 --> 1:08:30.540
 And that there's really nothing scientific about them

1:08:30.540 --> 1:08:33.100
 except essentially the rituals they ape

1:08:33.100 --> 1:08:35.300
 of the scientific process.

1:08:35.300 --> 1:08:38.140
 And the other path I think that makes you arrive

1:08:38.140 --> 1:08:41.380
 at the Austrian perspective or the libertarian perspective

1:08:41.380 --> 1:08:46.380
 I should say, is simply the notion of individuals

1:08:47.020 --> 1:08:49.700
 as having their own inalienable right

1:08:49.700 --> 1:08:51.820
 to decide what they want to do with themselves.

1:08:51.820 --> 1:08:55.700
 If you, I mean, the only way that you can give yourself

1:08:55.700 --> 1:09:00.700
 the idea that you get to be planner is ultimately

1:09:00.740 --> 1:09:02.520
 you think you're better than other people.

1:09:02.520 --> 1:09:05.820
 You think your choice, your judgment overrides mine.

1:09:05.820 --> 1:09:08.060
 And I don't think that's a defensible position.

1:09:08.060 --> 1:09:11.620
 I think I'm in no position to want to force anybody ever.

1:09:11.620 --> 1:09:13.500
 I will never want to force anybody

1:09:13.500 --> 1:09:15.820
 to do anything they don't want.

1:09:15.820 --> 1:09:18.880
 The Keynesian perspective, the central planning perspective

1:09:18.880 --> 1:09:22.660
 is unlike physics, which is let's force a bunch

1:09:22.660 --> 1:09:26.100
 of particles to sit in the lab so that we can study them.

1:09:26.100 --> 1:09:28.500
 In economics, you're forcing people to do things.

1:09:28.500 --> 1:09:31.100
 Let's stop these people from doing this job

1:09:31.100 --> 1:09:32.380
 because it's bad for the economy

1:09:32.380 --> 1:09:34.040
 and let's get them to do that job.

1:09:34.040 --> 1:09:35.700
 Let's force them to pay this price.

1:09:35.700 --> 1:09:37.500
 Let's tax them this much.

1:09:37.500 --> 1:09:39.460
 Let's prevent them from using gold as money

1:09:39.460 --> 1:09:42.260
 and force them to use our credit as money.

1:09:42.260 --> 1:09:44.540
 So it has to rely on coercion.

1:09:44.540 --> 1:09:46.620
 There's no central planning without coercion.

1:09:46.620 --> 1:09:49.180
 And coercion is a crime, in my opinion.

1:09:49.180 --> 1:09:51.780
 There's no way that it is justifiable morally or ethically.

1:09:51.780 --> 1:09:54.220
 So from a politics, from an ethical perspective,

1:09:55.340 --> 1:09:58.020
 your view is the, I mean, perhaps the,

1:09:58.020 --> 1:09:59.940
 broadly speaking, the libertarian view

1:09:59.940 --> 1:10:04.940
 is coercion is unethical, freedom is essential.

1:10:07.420 --> 1:10:09.940
 What is, what are the pros and cons

1:10:09.940 --> 1:10:12.380
 of government intervention in the economy?

1:10:12.380 --> 1:10:14.860
 So can you steal, can you provide pros?

1:10:14.860 --> 1:10:19.100
 You just kind of provided arguments against.

1:10:19.100 --> 1:10:20.900
 Is there any arguments to be made

1:10:20.900 --> 1:10:22.580
 for government intervention,

1:10:22.580 --> 1:10:25.260
 for the role of government in society?

1:10:25.260 --> 1:10:28.660
 Speaking from a political or from an economics perspective,

1:10:28.660 --> 1:10:31.460
 what is the positive role of government

1:10:31.460 --> 1:10:33.460
 that you can imagine you can speak to?

1:10:33.460 --> 1:10:34.920
 I can repeat many other cases,

1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:37.020
 but I don't find any of them compelling

1:10:37.020 --> 1:10:38.100
 for the reason that I mentioned,

1:10:38.100 --> 1:10:41.340
 which is that ultimately they all rely on

1:10:41.340 --> 1:10:42.520
 putting a gun to somebody's head

1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:43.820
 and using the threat of force.

1:10:43.820 --> 1:10:46.100
 So that's for me, it can never be justifiable.

1:10:46.100 --> 1:10:47.940
 Whatever the ends are,

1:10:47.940 --> 1:10:52.940
 if the means are violence and the threat of violence,

1:10:52.980 --> 1:10:55.100
 then the ends aren't justified.

1:10:55.100 --> 1:10:56.420
 Everything that's good,

1:10:56.420 --> 1:10:59.900
 governments will use as an excuse to justify coercion.

1:10:59.900 --> 1:11:01.500
 So, you know, what do you like?

1:11:01.500 --> 1:11:03.060
 You like motherhood and apple pie?

1:11:03.060 --> 1:11:04.300
 Well, government needs to ensure

1:11:04.300 --> 1:11:06.040
 that motherhood works well,

1:11:06.040 --> 1:11:09.520
 and we need the government central planning of birth.

1:11:09.520 --> 1:11:11.380
 We need regulations on birth, for instance.

1:11:11.380 --> 1:11:14.460
 We need regulations on how people give birth.

1:11:14.460 --> 1:11:16.140
 We need to ban people from giving birth

1:11:16.140 --> 1:11:18.100
 in traditional ways that have been tried

1:11:18.100 --> 1:11:18.940
 for thousands of years.

1:11:18.940 --> 1:11:20.980
 We need to force people to do things

1:11:20.980 --> 1:11:22.820
 in the modern scientific way.

1:11:22.820 --> 1:11:26.500
 Well, so what about things like that all of us use,

1:11:26.500 --> 1:11:29.500
 so infrastructure, for example, or education,

1:11:31.020 --> 1:11:33.540
 or, well, the economy too, right?

1:11:35.180 --> 1:11:38.460
 Can you make a case for the role

1:11:38.460 --> 1:11:42.140
 of some large scale centralized systems,

1:11:42.140 --> 1:11:43.580
 whether it's government or not,

1:11:43.580 --> 1:11:45.340
 that do this kind of management?

1:11:45.340 --> 1:11:46.700
 I guess, perhaps you could say

1:11:46.700 --> 1:11:48.840
 there's the economies of scale argument

1:11:48.840 --> 1:11:52.280
 that some things must exist at a very large scale,

1:11:52.280 --> 1:11:56.860
 and therefore you would want political accountability

1:11:56.860 --> 1:11:58.100
 of the people who manage them.

1:11:58.100 --> 1:11:59.060
 This is kind of the argument

1:11:59.060 --> 1:12:01.460
 that's given for infrastructure monopolies.

1:12:01.460 --> 1:12:03.680
 For instance, roads or electricity.

1:12:05.780 --> 1:12:07.060
 Let's say we live in a country,

1:12:07.060 --> 1:12:08.180
 we need one power plant.

1:12:08.180 --> 1:12:11.180
 The bigger the power plant, the better off we will all be.

1:12:11.180 --> 1:12:15.020
 And there's a natural monopoly in the power plant business.

1:12:15.020 --> 1:12:17.160
 So we're gonna have to have one power plant.

1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:19.380
 And since it's only one power plant,

1:12:19.380 --> 1:12:22.100
 then we can't just let anybody own it

1:12:22.100 --> 1:12:24.380
 because then they're gonna make it too expensive.

1:12:24.380 --> 1:12:26.240
 So we need to have the government own it

1:12:26.240 --> 1:12:28.180
 so it can make it too expensive.

1:12:28.180 --> 1:12:29.900
 And you don't find that case compelling?

1:12:29.900 --> 1:12:30.740
 Not at all.

1:12:30.740 --> 1:12:31.580
 I used to believe in it.

1:12:31.580 --> 1:12:33.620
 I was pretty much a Keynesian

1:12:33.620 --> 1:12:38.620
 when I first started my graduate studies at Columbia.

1:12:38.620 --> 1:12:40.180
 No, I don't find that compelling at all

1:12:40.180 --> 1:12:42.700
 because I think all these examples that they mention

1:12:42.700 --> 1:12:45.540
 of natural monopolies or economies of scale

1:12:45.540 --> 1:12:47.740
 that can only fit at a scale of government,

1:12:51.220 --> 1:12:54.420
 government bans people from opening power plants.

1:12:54.420 --> 1:12:56.140
 And then there's only one power plant

1:12:56.140 --> 1:12:58.180
 and they need to be in charge of it.

1:12:58.180 --> 1:13:01.580
 But in reality, no.

1:13:01.580 --> 1:13:04.580
 In reality, power plants can exist at all kinds of manners

1:13:04.580 --> 1:13:06.420
 of scales of operation.

1:13:06.420 --> 1:13:08.820
 And yes, of course, there are benefits to centralization

1:13:08.820 --> 1:13:10.260
 in power plants in particular

1:13:10.260 --> 1:13:13.180
 because there's efficiency in generation.

1:13:13.180 --> 1:13:17.100
 One big power plant is more efficient

1:13:17.100 --> 1:13:20.020
 than 10 equivalent smaller power plants.

1:13:20.020 --> 1:13:22.260
 But there's also inefficiencies in centralization

1:13:22.260 --> 1:13:25.540
 because the more centralized and the bigger the plant is,

1:13:25.540 --> 1:13:29.920
 the further away a lot of the population is going to be.

1:13:29.920 --> 1:13:31.960
 So you're gonna be losing a lot of the electricity

1:13:31.960 --> 1:13:33.540
 and transmission.

1:13:33.540 --> 1:13:36.020
 And you believe the free market is best in managing

1:13:36.020 --> 1:13:39.220
 that dance, that balance of centralization.

1:13:39.220 --> 1:13:41.540
 Exactly, and if we do end up in a situation

1:13:41.540 --> 1:13:44.380
 where there's one power plant for an area,

1:13:44.380 --> 1:13:48.940
 then if the markets ends up centralizing all of it

1:13:48.940 --> 1:13:52.780
 into one power plant, I don't see that as a problem.

1:13:52.780 --> 1:13:54.860
 There are places, there's a small town

1:13:54.860 --> 1:13:56.060
 with only one barber shop.

1:13:56.060 --> 1:13:57.460
 Is that a catastrophe?

1:13:57.460 --> 1:14:00.900
 No, because they don't need two barber shops.

1:14:00.900 --> 1:14:03.060
 Now, if that barber shop started to take advantage

1:14:03.060 --> 1:14:05.380
 of people, started to charge higher price,

1:14:05.380 --> 1:14:07.460
 well, then that's just an opportunity for others

1:14:07.460 --> 1:14:10.020
 to step in and put them in their place.

1:14:10.020 --> 1:14:11.460
 And that's the same thing with power plants.

1:14:11.460 --> 1:14:13.580
 It's the same thing with everything.

1:14:13.580 --> 1:14:17.340
 Ultimately, I think the key thing is this.

1:14:17.340 --> 1:14:20.140
 From the central planning perspective,

1:14:20.140 --> 1:14:22.700
 they'll present you the problem as it is,

1:14:22.700 --> 1:14:24.620
 and they'll tell you, well, this is bad.

1:14:24.620 --> 1:14:28.140
 So the fix, and what we can do is better.

1:14:28.140 --> 1:14:31.900
 So let's stop what's bad and do what is better.

1:14:31.900 --> 1:14:32.740
 Two problems here.

1:14:32.740 --> 1:14:34.960
 Usually, the reason that the thing is bad

1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:37.100
 in the first place is because it is a government monopoly.

1:14:37.100 --> 1:14:39.180
 It's because of government intervention.

1:14:39.180 --> 1:14:41.980
 But the second thing is that this notion

1:14:41.980 --> 1:14:44.180
 that we could just pass a law and fix what's wrong

1:14:44.180 --> 1:14:48.700
 and make it better, it ignores the fundamental

1:14:48.700 --> 1:14:51.500
 underlying reality, which is that what you're doing

1:14:51.500 --> 1:14:54.780
 is you're offering only one way for this problem

1:14:54.780 --> 1:14:57.340
 to be solved and making all other solutions

1:14:57.340 --> 1:14:58.340
 practically illegal.

1:14:58.340 --> 1:15:00.860
 You're taking taxpayer money, you're putting guns

1:15:00.860 --> 1:15:02.940
 to people's heads to take their money,

1:15:02.940 --> 1:15:04.940
 to use it to build, say, this one solution

1:15:04.940 --> 1:15:07.380
 for a power plant, but you're preventing

1:15:07.380 --> 1:15:09.820
 the free market process from providing us

1:15:09.820 --> 1:15:11.300
 with other alternatives.

1:15:11.300 --> 1:15:13.700
 Well, so you phrased it sort of from that perspective,

1:15:13.700 --> 1:15:18.500
 but in theory, there is a feedback accountability mechanism

1:15:18.500 --> 1:15:22.340
 for the solution that you propose and enforce

1:15:22.340 --> 1:15:25.840
 by, as you're saying, placing a gun to people's head.

1:15:25.840 --> 1:15:29.140
 You're accountable for that choice,

1:15:29.140 --> 1:15:30.780
 for the quality of that solution,

1:15:30.780 --> 1:15:34.740
 by being voted out if the solution is actually bad.

1:15:34.740 --> 1:15:37.300
 So it's just a different selection mechanism.

1:15:37.300 --> 1:15:41.420
 And I think, I personally believe it is a selection mechanism

1:15:41.420 --> 1:15:43.540
 that has worked in the past.

1:15:43.540 --> 1:15:46.980
 It just often does not work nearly as well

1:15:46.980 --> 1:15:48.660
 as a free market.

1:15:48.660 --> 1:15:52.020
 And the question is, are there domains

1:15:52.020 --> 1:15:54.780
 in which the free market gets itself into trouble?

1:15:54.780 --> 1:15:58.820
 So this theoretical view is that that's the point

1:15:58.820 --> 1:16:01.940
 of a free market, is it doesn't, if there's trouble,

1:16:02.840 --> 1:16:05.780
 that's a signal, and it will respond to that signal,

1:16:05.780 --> 1:16:07.860
 and it will respond appropriately

1:16:07.860 --> 1:16:10.340
 to try to maximize happiness.

1:16:10.340 --> 1:16:12.460
 The question is, is there a local optima

1:16:12.460 --> 1:16:15.620
 that free markets get stuck in and need governments

1:16:15.620 --> 1:16:19.100
 to represent the broader scale of the people

1:16:19.100 --> 1:16:20.500
 to get outside of that?

1:16:20.500 --> 1:16:24.180
 I think the fundamental problem here is the idea

1:16:24.180 --> 1:16:26.100
 that there is a feedback mechanism

1:16:26.100 --> 1:16:28.940
 when there is coercion in one party,

1:16:28.940 --> 1:16:31.780
 when one party can employ coercion and the other one cannot.

1:16:31.780 --> 1:16:34.840
 So in other words, I'm gonna put a gun to your head,

1:16:34.840 --> 1:16:36.900
 I'm gonna take your money, and I'm gonna use it

1:16:36.900 --> 1:16:39.960
 to buy more guns for me to put against your head,

1:16:39.960 --> 1:16:42.980
 but somehow you're gonna put a paper in a box

1:16:42.980 --> 1:16:45.920
 and that's going to deactivate my guns.

1:16:45.920 --> 1:16:48.020
 Well, love requires a push and pull,

1:16:48.020 --> 1:16:50.340
 a little bit of tension, a little spice in a relationship,

1:16:50.340 --> 1:16:53.660
 I think, a little gun to the head.

1:16:53.660 --> 1:16:55.500
 Good luck to anybody who's gonna be dating you

1:16:55.500 --> 1:16:57.140
 if you think putting a gun to people's head

1:16:57.140 --> 1:16:58.780
 is comparable to a relationship.

1:17:00.340 --> 1:17:04.340
 All jokes, but yes, I mean, the people don't often think

1:17:04.340 --> 1:17:09.340
 of it as government and the military as gun to the head,

1:17:09.340 --> 1:17:11.700
 but that is sort of a libertarian perspective

1:17:11.700 --> 1:17:13.820
 because ultimately when you, you know,

1:17:13.820 --> 1:17:16.660
 turtles all the way down and at the bottom there's guns.

1:17:16.660 --> 1:17:17.500
 Yeah, so.

1:17:17.500 --> 1:17:18.860
 At the bottom if you don't want to pay,

1:17:18.860 --> 1:17:19.740
 if you don't want to, you know,

1:17:19.740 --> 1:17:21.260
 all right, I don't want to be part of your power plant,

1:17:21.260 --> 1:17:23.180
 I want to get my own generator, I don't want to do it,

1:17:23.180 --> 1:17:25.260
 and I don't want to pay for it, I'll go to jail.

1:17:25.260 --> 1:17:26.620
 You can't not pay for it.

1:17:26.620 --> 1:17:28.580
 That's really the asymmetry which the market doesn't have,

1:17:28.580 --> 1:17:31.940
 which is why, in my opinion, it's not as if, you know,

1:17:31.940 --> 1:17:34.220
 I'm being stubborn and stuck on the idea

1:17:34.220 --> 1:17:37.580
 that I want a market and that the government can't work.

1:17:37.580 --> 1:17:39.620
 It's presented as if, you know, we're choosing

1:17:39.620 --> 1:17:40.940
 between two different machines.

1:17:40.940 --> 1:17:43.940
 You know, should we use an Apple or a PC?

1:17:43.940 --> 1:17:46.740
 And I'm just constantly choosing one of them

1:17:46.740 --> 1:17:48.660
 and saying that the other one can't work.

1:17:48.660 --> 1:17:50.500
 It's not equivalent, it's not two machines.

1:17:50.500 --> 1:17:54.700
 We're comparing between a machine and a gun to the head.

1:17:54.700 --> 1:17:56.020
 And we're comparing between a situation

1:17:56.020 --> 1:17:59.980
 in which anybody anywhere is free to provide the service

1:17:59.980 --> 1:18:02.740
 or the good, and anybody anywhere is free to buy it

1:18:02.740 --> 1:18:05.020
 from them or reject to buy it from them.

1:18:05.020 --> 1:18:08.260
 So anyone can build a power plant, anyone can succeed at it,

1:18:08.260 --> 1:18:10.860
 anybody can fail at it, anybody can build it in a way

1:18:10.860 --> 1:18:14.100
 that I can choose to take part in or not take part in.

1:18:14.100 --> 1:18:15.380
 I can build my own.

1:18:15.380 --> 1:18:18.260
 So we have a situation which 10 million people, let's say,

1:18:18.260 --> 1:18:22.220
 they each can freely choose to provide the good

1:18:22.220 --> 1:18:23.620
 or to buy the good.

1:18:23.620 --> 1:18:28.100
 That cannot be considered an alternative on an equal footing

1:18:28.100 --> 1:18:31.060
 to a situation where one person or one entity

1:18:31.060 --> 1:18:33.740
 gets to decide for everybody and those people

1:18:33.740 --> 1:18:37.260
 decide for everybody and those who disagree go to jail.

1:18:37.260 --> 1:18:41.900
 So the problem is that the alternative to governments

1:18:41.900 --> 1:18:45.820
 is other large successful entities that have humans in them

1:18:45.820 --> 1:18:48.180
 and human nature is such that there's corruption,

1:18:48.180 --> 1:18:50.180
 manipulation and so on.

1:18:50.180 --> 1:18:54.340
 I think free market depends on the honest communication

1:18:57.020 --> 1:18:59.980
 of information as widely as possible

1:18:59.980 --> 1:19:02.620
 so that people can make great rational decisions

1:19:02.620 --> 1:19:06.100
 but sort of my fear is, I'd like to propose

1:19:06.100 --> 1:19:08.060
 is that in general there's manipulation

1:19:08.060 --> 1:19:10.180
 whether it's government, whether it's companies.

1:19:10.180 --> 1:19:13.060
 They're going to try to do propaganda.

1:19:13.060 --> 1:19:16.980
 They're going to try to manipulate you, deceive you,

1:19:16.980 --> 1:19:19.940
 shut down competition by playing games,

1:19:19.940 --> 1:19:21.500
 human games of different kinds

1:19:22.620 --> 1:19:24.380
 and sometimes even meaning well.

1:19:24.380 --> 1:19:26.140
 It's not like everybody thinks they're doing good

1:19:26.140 --> 1:19:27.620
 and they're actually doing evil.

1:19:27.620 --> 1:19:32.620
 So how do we prevent the worst of human nature coming out

1:19:32.820 --> 1:19:35.020
 in a free market as well?

1:19:35.020 --> 1:19:37.540
 By not giving the worst of human nature

1:19:37.540 --> 1:19:40.740
 a monopoly on violence in the institution of government.

1:19:40.740 --> 1:19:42.940
 That little inkling of coercion,

1:19:42.940 --> 1:19:47.100
 that little bit of asymmetry creates a gigantic

1:19:47.100 --> 1:19:49.940
 like ripple effect of asymmetry in your view.

1:19:49.940 --> 1:19:51.700
 Yes and it ends up just being the place

1:19:51.700 --> 1:19:55.180
 where corporations, individuals, free markets,

1:19:55.180 --> 1:19:57.820
 they can't coerce without the resort to government.

1:19:57.820 --> 1:19:59.460
 So you think about all the examples

1:19:59.460 --> 1:20:02.740
 of corrupt corporations doing bad things.

1:20:02.740 --> 1:20:06.420
 It's always because they have certain privileges

1:20:06.420 --> 1:20:10.060
 from governments because as it exists,

1:20:10.060 --> 1:20:13.060
 Coca Cola, McDonald's, all of these giant corporations,

1:20:13.060 --> 1:20:15.860
 they can't do anything to me without government.

1:20:15.860 --> 1:20:17.140
 They can't take any of my money

1:20:17.140 --> 1:20:19.300
 and they can't force me to buy their stuff

1:20:19.300 --> 1:20:21.460
 and so it doesn't matter to me.

1:20:21.460 --> 1:20:24.020
 So if Coca Cola is corrupted,

1:20:24.020 --> 1:20:25.820
 that's a problem for Coca Cola customers,

1:20:25.820 --> 1:20:27.940
 that's a problem for Coca Cola shareholders,

1:20:27.940 --> 1:20:30.940
 that's a problem for anybody who deals with Coca Cola

1:20:30.940 --> 1:20:32.460
 but as somebody who doesn't drink their stuff

1:20:32.460 --> 1:20:34.380
 and isn't a shareholder,

1:20:34.380 --> 1:20:36.540
 I have absolutely no interest in what happens.

1:20:36.540 --> 1:20:38.980
 They could all go bust tomorrow and I don't care.

1:20:38.980 --> 1:20:43.220
 I don't buy their product and I'm not a shareholder.

1:20:43.220 --> 1:20:46.420
 So in this situation where you choose to voluntarily

1:20:47.340 --> 1:20:50.140
 associate with people and you only give your money

1:20:50.140 --> 1:20:52.460
 to people you want to voluntarily give the money to

1:20:52.460 --> 1:20:54.260
 so you either buy their product

1:20:54.260 --> 1:20:55.900
 or invest in their production,

1:20:55.900 --> 1:20:58.740
 in that situation, the only way that a company

1:20:58.740 --> 1:21:03.100
 can get my money is if they build a product that I value

1:21:03.100 --> 1:21:07.260
 or if they convince me that they are going to use it

1:21:07.260 --> 1:21:10.780
 in a way that's profitable and I may be wrong.

1:21:10.780 --> 1:21:12.700
 I may invest in a company that fails

1:21:12.700 --> 1:21:17.300
 or I may invest in a company that turns out to be fraudulent

1:21:17.300 --> 1:21:22.300
 but that's my fault and it's my fault

1:21:23.620 --> 1:21:24.740
 that I gave them my money

1:21:24.740 --> 1:21:26.860
 and then it turned out to be scoundrels

1:21:26.860 --> 1:21:28.980
 but it's a totally different problem

1:21:28.980 --> 1:21:32.260
 when we make it mandatory.

1:21:32.260 --> 1:21:36.100
 It's violence, it's a crime to put a gun to my head

1:21:36.100 --> 1:21:38.540
 and force me to subsidize companies

1:21:38.540 --> 1:21:41.300
 and force me to come at certain conclusions.

1:21:41.300 --> 1:21:43.180
 Do you find an interesting distinction,

1:21:43.180 --> 1:21:46.740
 Mr. Michael Malice, between anarchism and libertarianism?

1:21:46.740 --> 1:21:49.800
 So this particular use of violence,

1:21:50.900 --> 1:21:53.680
 this last resort, this policing force

1:21:53.680 --> 1:21:56.220
 that libertarianism is okay with

1:21:56.220 --> 1:21:58.740
 and anarchism is not okay with.

1:21:58.740 --> 1:22:02.500
 So basically nation states that keep you safe

1:22:02.500 --> 1:22:05.320
 from the worst of war.

1:22:05.320 --> 1:22:06.540
 Yeah, I think to be more accurate,

1:22:06.540 --> 1:22:09.020
 the distinction between anarchism and minarchism,

1:22:09.020 --> 1:22:11.660
 I think libertarianism is kind of a vague term

1:22:11.660 --> 1:22:13.300
 that can encompass both.

1:22:13.300 --> 1:22:14.420
 Means a lot of things, okay.

1:22:14.420 --> 1:22:15.500
 Yeah.

1:22:15.500 --> 1:22:19.880
 On the Karl Marx to Michael Malice spectrum,

1:22:19.880 --> 1:22:20.720
 where do you?

1:22:20.720 --> 1:22:22.140
 No, no, I'm full anarchist.

1:22:22.140 --> 1:22:22.980
 You're a full anarchist.

1:22:22.980 --> 1:22:23.800
 Yeah, full anarchist.

1:22:23.800 --> 1:22:26.320
 I mean, I don't find any justification

1:22:26.320 --> 1:22:31.320
 for the use of force and I think recently perhaps,

1:22:31.460 --> 1:22:33.780
 maybe I'm getting old, maybe I'm getting senile,

1:22:33.780 --> 1:22:36.060
 maybe I'm getting wise, who knows?

1:22:36.060 --> 1:22:39.660
 But I'm beginning to become more sympathetic to monarchy.

1:22:39.660 --> 1:22:43.180
 So I'm an anarchist, monarchy.

1:22:43.180 --> 1:22:44.440
 Which, what is that?

1:22:44.440 --> 1:22:46.020
 Kings, royal. Oh, monarchy.

1:22:46.020 --> 1:22:46.860
 Yeah.

1:22:46.860 --> 1:22:49.020
 And I think.

1:22:49.020 --> 1:22:51.860
 Wait, are you joking or not?

1:22:51.860 --> 1:22:53.140
 No, I'm not joking.

1:22:53.140 --> 1:22:58.140
 And I think, I mean, I think morally and intellectually,

1:22:58.420 --> 1:23:02.380
 I'm an anarchist, but the reality is we find ourselves

1:23:02.380 --> 1:23:05.560
 in a world in which a lot of people are not.

1:23:05.560 --> 1:23:09.380
 And the question is, what is the thing

1:23:09.380 --> 1:23:12.760
 that is going to provide you with more freedom?

1:23:12.760 --> 1:23:16.740
 And I think, I'm recently coming around to the idea

1:23:16.740 --> 1:23:19.420
 that monarchy might be the best way

1:23:19.420 --> 1:23:22.080
 to provide people with the largest amount of freedom

1:23:22.080 --> 1:23:25.960
 because to have a free society, you need a majority,

1:23:25.960 --> 1:23:28.060
 perhaps, or a plurality of people

1:23:28.060 --> 1:23:31.880
 to have a very strong understanding of libertarian ideas,

1:23:31.880 --> 1:23:33.100
 to have a low time preference,

1:23:33.100 --> 1:23:35.720
 to have a preference for the future.

1:23:35.720 --> 1:23:37.480
 So you need a majority of the population

1:23:37.480 --> 1:23:41.300
 to not decide to go and do something insane

1:23:41.300 --> 1:23:44.400
 in order to continue to have a free society.

1:23:44.400 --> 1:23:48.580
 You know, when a respiratory illness comes along,

1:23:48.580 --> 1:23:51.140
 unfortunately, you know, the last couple of years

1:23:51.140 --> 1:23:53.620
 showed that we, the vast majority of people

1:23:53.620 --> 1:23:57.340
 are gonna freak out and lose their mind

1:23:57.340 --> 1:24:00.500
 and support whatever their stupid TV tells them to support.

1:24:00.500 --> 1:24:03.580
 And, you know, there's always a current thing

1:24:03.580 --> 1:24:05.840
 and the media is always telling you

1:24:05.840 --> 1:24:08.320
 that we need this current thing as an excuse

1:24:08.320 --> 1:24:10.260
 for more and more government power

1:24:10.260 --> 1:24:11.660
 and more and more government coercion.

1:24:11.660 --> 1:24:13.100
 What's the role of kings and queens

1:24:13.100 --> 1:24:15.980
 in that case of a monarchy?

1:24:15.980 --> 1:24:17.700
 What's the role of a leader?

1:24:17.700 --> 1:24:20.840
 I think there might be a case that,

1:24:21.700 --> 1:24:24.340
 so as I was saying, you need a majority of the population

1:24:24.340 --> 1:24:28.300
 to get together and decide, nope, whatever is the case,

1:24:28.300 --> 1:24:30.500
 you know, the answer is voluntary.

1:24:31.660 --> 1:24:34.100
 No matter how bad the disease is,

1:24:34.100 --> 1:24:36.320
 it doesn't justify forcing people to stay home.

1:24:36.320 --> 1:24:37.520
 You wanna stay home, stay home.

1:24:37.520 --> 1:24:39.640
 You wanna wear a mask, take a vaccine,

1:24:39.640 --> 1:24:42.460
 do whatever you want, but you can't force others to do that.

1:24:42.460 --> 1:24:43.940
 So you need a majority of the people

1:24:43.940 --> 1:24:46.420
 to strongly believe in this principle

1:24:46.420 --> 1:24:50.380
 in order to get it in a democracy.

1:24:50.380 --> 1:24:52.480
 Whereas in a monarchy,

1:24:52.480 --> 1:24:54.460
 maybe you just need the king to get it.

1:24:54.460 --> 1:24:57.400
 And I think the reason kings are more likely to get it

1:24:57.400 --> 1:25:00.000
 is that kings have a low time preference

1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:03.540
 where they think about things for many generations.

1:25:03.540 --> 1:25:05.420
 Whereas in a democratic system,

1:25:05.420 --> 1:25:08.220
 your president is likely only going to be there

1:25:08.220 --> 1:25:10.620
 for four years or eight years or 10 years

1:25:10.620 --> 1:25:12.620
 or five years or whatever it is.

1:25:12.620 --> 1:25:14.540
 So the only way that, you know,

1:25:14.540 --> 1:25:15.900
 all humans are self interested.

1:25:15.900 --> 1:25:17.940
 So the only way that your president in a democracy

1:25:17.940 --> 1:25:20.980
 can provide for themselves is to maximize

1:25:20.980 --> 1:25:23.300
 the amount of exploitation that they can do

1:25:23.300 --> 1:25:26.380
 of the population during their brief stint.

1:25:26.380 --> 1:25:28.660
 And then when he's out, you get a new one,

1:25:28.660 --> 1:25:30.540
 and then that one wants to start all over again.

1:25:30.540 --> 1:25:33.060
 So every four years, you get a new robber.

1:25:33.060 --> 1:25:37.260
 With monarchy, you sign up for a multi generation

1:25:37.260 --> 1:25:41.380
 subscription to the same family.

1:25:41.380 --> 1:25:44.140
 And when they have the security of knowing that,

1:25:44.140 --> 1:25:47.940
 you know, his great grandson is going to be

1:25:47.940 --> 1:25:50.860
 taking money from your great grandson,

1:25:50.860 --> 1:25:54.340
 suddenly his interest in yours align

1:25:54.340 --> 1:25:56.420
 because they both want your great grandson

1:25:56.420 --> 1:25:58.500
 to be prosperous and have enough money

1:25:58.500 --> 1:26:00.260
 for his great grandson to take.

1:26:00.260 --> 1:26:02.320
 It's a monarchy with a tiny government.

1:26:02.320 --> 1:26:07.320
 So anything required to really provide for a free market.

1:26:08.980 --> 1:26:11.020
 So for maximizing individual freedom

1:26:11.020 --> 1:26:12.460
 and the freedom of the economy.

1:26:12.460 --> 1:26:15.460
 Yeah, and if I were a king, which is highly unlikely

1:26:15.460 --> 1:26:17.060
 to ever happen, but I think, you know,

1:26:17.060 --> 1:26:20.140
 if you look historically, the dynasties

1:26:20.140 --> 1:26:23.180
 that have succeeded at lasting for a long time,

1:26:23.180 --> 1:26:24.940
 the key thing that they managed to do

1:26:24.940 --> 1:26:26.900
 is to basically be libertarian.

1:26:26.900 --> 1:26:29.780
 The key to being a good king is to just leave people alone.

1:26:29.780 --> 1:26:31.180
 Let them do whatever they want.

1:26:31.180 --> 1:26:34.260
 Don't rob them too much or rob them as little as possible,

1:26:34.260 --> 1:26:36.140
 or maybe even don't rob them.

1:26:36.140 --> 1:26:40.580
 And, you know, as a king, use your power only

1:26:40.580 --> 1:26:43.220
 to punish people who aggress against others.

1:26:43.220 --> 1:26:44.900
 Don't use your power to enrich yourself

1:26:44.900 --> 1:26:46.340
 and enrich your friends.

1:26:46.340 --> 1:26:49.760
 And that's really, like, if you look at smart kings,

1:26:49.760 --> 1:26:50.600
 this is what they do.

1:26:50.600 --> 1:26:51.740
 This is what they teach their children.

1:26:51.740 --> 1:26:54.180
 And the cycle of kingdoms is that, you know,

1:26:54.180 --> 1:26:56.020
 the first king understands this,

1:26:56.020 --> 1:26:59.780
 builds the empire and the first couple of generations,

1:26:59.780 --> 1:27:04.700
 they get this and the society is free, the economy is free.

1:27:04.700 --> 1:27:09.100
 And because of that, you know, there's peace and prosperity,

1:27:09.100 --> 1:27:12.500
 but then over time, the next generation of kids

1:27:12.500 --> 1:27:14.780
 become a lot more high time preference.

1:27:14.780 --> 1:27:17.300
 They haven't worked hard.

1:27:17.300 --> 1:27:20.020
 They don't understand the meaning of hard work.

1:27:20.020 --> 1:27:23.780
 So they become more likely to engage

1:27:23.780 --> 1:27:24.940
 in destructive behavior.

1:27:24.940 --> 1:27:29.940
 So raise taxes, pass laws that require people to do things,

1:27:31.180 --> 1:27:33.860
 even when they're not hurting anybody.

1:27:33.860 --> 1:27:36.900
 And that ends up basically eventually destroying the kingdom.

1:27:37.940 --> 1:27:40.300
 Of course, power corrupts.

1:27:40.300 --> 1:27:42.780
 So you have to kind of create human institutions

1:27:42.780 --> 1:27:45.940
 that prevent you as a king or any kind of leader

1:27:45.940 --> 1:27:50.940
 from expand, so going back on the original promises

1:27:52.180 --> 1:27:54.620
 and the purposes of your position.

1:27:54.620 --> 1:27:58.020
 And then distracting, using tools of technology

1:27:58.020 --> 1:28:00.060
 and communication to distract the populace

1:28:00.060 --> 1:28:01.300
 while you expand the power.

1:28:01.300 --> 1:28:02.140
 Exactly.

1:28:02.140 --> 1:28:05.780
 All right, you wrote the fiat standard.

1:28:05.780 --> 1:28:08.580
 I think we danced around it quite a bit,

1:28:08.580 --> 1:28:10.180
 but I don't know if we actually defined it.

1:28:10.180 --> 1:28:11.860
 So what is fiat money?

1:28:11.860 --> 1:28:14.700
 What is the history of how it came to be?

1:28:14.700 --> 1:28:16.140
 The fascinating history of the birth

1:28:16.140 --> 1:28:18.460
 of the fiat monetary system is something

1:28:18.460 --> 1:28:21.740
 that really only got uncovered in 2017.

1:28:21.740 --> 1:28:25.100
 This is extremely, extremely interesting.

1:28:25.100 --> 1:28:29.700
 In 1914, Britain joined World War I.

1:28:29.700 --> 1:28:31.740
 And if you remember your history books,

1:28:31.740 --> 1:28:35.380
 it's famous that this was called August Bank Holiday.

1:28:35.380 --> 1:28:36.820
 It was just going to be a few weeks

1:28:36.820 --> 1:28:38.340
 where the British troops were gonna go

1:28:38.340 --> 1:28:41.780
 and kick European ass and come back triumphant.

1:28:41.780 --> 1:28:44.100
 And most European countries believed that.

1:28:44.100 --> 1:28:46.420
 But then the war kept on dragging on.

1:28:46.420 --> 1:28:48.380
 And of course, to finance the war,

1:28:48.380 --> 1:28:49.980
 the government, this is what they used to do

1:28:49.980 --> 1:28:50.820
 under the gold standard,

1:28:50.820 --> 1:28:53.020
 governments would issue bonds.

1:28:53.020 --> 1:28:55.660
 So you'd issue the bonds, people would buy the bonds,

1:28:55.660 --> 1:28:57.980
 the money would be used to finance the military,

1:28:57.980 --> 1:29:00.740
 and then the government would pay off the bond

1:29:00.740 --> 1:29:03.060
 over the next five or 10 or 20 years.

1:29:03.060 --> 1:29:06.260
 So for World War I, the British government,

1:29:06.260 --> 1:29:10.220
 the British treasury issued bonds for financing the war.

1:29:10.220 --> 1:29:13.460
 And this only came to light in 2017.

1:29:13.460 --> 1:29:15.860
 Only a third of the bonds were actually subscribed.

1:29:15.860 --> 1:29:17.260
 So people, British people,

1:29:17.260 --> 1:29:19.180
 and this is perhaps the greatest thing

1:29:19.180 --> 1:29:20.340
 that they've ever done,

1:29:20.340 --> 1:29:22.220
 they decided fighting a war in Europe

1:29:22.220 --> 1:29:25.300
 is just not my ideal way of investing my capital.

1:29:25.300 --> 1:29:26.140
 It's a stupid thing.

1:29:26.140 --> 1:29:27.300
 Why should I go and fight?

1:29:27.300 --> 1:29:30.180
 Because the Austrians and the Germans and the Serbians

1:29:30.180 --> 1:29:34.220
 are at each other's throats.

1:29:34.220 --> 1:29:36.180
 I'd rather invest in something else.

1:29:36.180 --> 1:29:38.940
 So they only bought a third of the bond issue.

1:29:38.940 --> 1:29:42.140
 And then the astonishing thing that happened,

1:29:42.140 --> 1:29:44.180
 which really set the tone for the next century

1:29:44.180 --> 1:29:49.140
 of war, murder, Keynesianism, and theft and inflation,

1:29:49.140 --> 1:29:52.740
 was that the Bank of England went and got

1:29:52.740 --> 1:29:56.700
 two of the high ranking officials in the Bank of England

1:29:56.700 --> 1:29:59.460
 to buy the other remaining outstanding two thirds

1:29:59.460 --> 1:30:01.580
 of the bonds under their own name

1:30:01.580 --> 1:30:03.220
 with a line of credit from the Bank of England.

1:30:03.220 --> 1:30:04.740
 So it wasn't their own money.

1:30:04.740 --> 1:30:06.700
 But they took money essentially from the Bank of England,

1:30:06.700 --> 1:30:10.420
 bought two thirds of the bonds that financed the war.

1:30:10.420 --> 1:30:12.700
 And that was how England was able

1:30:12.700 --> 1:30:14.900
 to keep going into the war.

1:30:14.900 --> 1:30:17.140
 So that's essentially what they did

1:30:17.140 --> 1:30:20.180
 is what we today know as quantitative easing.

1:30:20.180 --> 1:30:23.740
 Back then, they just got, they printed money

1:30:23.740 --> 1:30:26.220
 from the Bank of England, or credit, printed credit,

1:30:26.220 --> 1:30:29.020
 gave it to those two employees.

1:30:29.020 --> 1:30:30.020
 They bought the bonds.

1:30:30.020 --> 1:30:32.420
 The government could fight the war.

1:30:32.420 --> 1:30:34.540
 Sounds like it's a nice idea.

1:30:34.540 --> 1:30:38.180
 And Keynes, of course, being a huckster himself,

1:30:38.180 --> 1:30:42.100
 he himself said this was, he wrote a letter

1:30:42.100 --> 1:30:44.020
 to the Bank of England that was uncovered recently.

1:30:44.020 --> 1:30:45.900
 And he said, I congratulate you

1:30:45.900 --> 1:30:48.020
 on this masterly manipulation.

1:30:48.020 --> 1:30:49.420
 I quote it in the book.

1:30:49.420 --> 1:30:51.700
 Masterly manipulation is what he called it.

1:30:51.700 --> 1:30:54.740
 That they basically managed to buy the bonds

1:30:54.740 --> 1:30:56.420
 using the money of the government.

1:30:56.420 --> 1:31:00.020
 And of course, he never had an idea of how economics works

1:31:00.020 --> 1:31:01.620
 because he never could ask the question of,

1:31:01.620 --> 1:31:02.780
 okay, and then what?

1:31:02.780 --> 1:31:04.380
 All right, so we just printed money

1:31:04.380 --> 1:31:07.340
 to buy two thirds of these government bonds.

1:31:07.340 --> 1:31:09.060
 What's gonna happen next?

1:31:09.060 --> 1:31:10.420
 What could go wrong?

1:31:10.420 --> 1:31:12.860
 Not a question Keynesians ask themselves

1:31:12.860 --> 1:31:16.740
 because their jobs depend on not thinking

1:31:16.740 --> 1:31:18.300
 about what's going to go wrong.

1:31:18.300 --> 1:31:20.660
 So a quick question about war.

1:31:20.660 --> 1:31:23.660
 And as somebody who's been nonstop reading

1:31:23.660 --> 1:31:26.700
 and thinking about the wars of the 20th century

1:31:26.700 --> 1:31:31.660
 and thinking that most of those wars

1:31:31.660 --> 1:31:34.500
 were unjust, unethical, and destructive,

1:31:37.060 --> 1:31:40.180
 how else do you find, how would you finance a war?

1:31:40.180 --> 1:31:41.020
 So.

1:31:41.020 --> 1:31:41.940
 Ideally you don't.

1:31:41.940 --> 1:31:43.060
 No, but I mean, of course there are,

1:31:43.060 --> 1:31:45.140
 sometimes you wanna fight for self defense.

1:31:45.140 --> 1:31:48.540
 Yeah, you finance it, taxation, or bonds.

1:31:48.540 --> 1:31:51.140
 See, the people really need to want a war

1:31:51.140 --> 1:31:54.020
 not just with their voices, their thoughts,

1:31:54.020 --> 1:31:56.740
 their tweets, or their actual financial investment.

1:31:56.740 --> 1:31:59.260
 Put up the bullets and the cost of the bullets

1:31:59.260 --> 1:32:00.420
 and the bodies.

1:32:00.420 --> 1:32:03.660
 So their life and their financial well being.

1:32:05.500 --> 1:32:07.420
 That's how it was under the gold standard mostly

1:32:07.420 --> 1:32:09.220
 because under the gold standard,

1:32:09.220 --> 1:32:10.660
 the government couldn't print gold.

1:32:10.660 --> 1:32:12.780
 And so they had a budget and they had a certain amount

1:32:12.780 --> 1:32:15.020
 of gold and that wasn't just, you know,

1:32:15.020 --> 1:32:16.740
 that they couldn't infinitely increase it.

1:32:16.740 --> 1:32:20.180
 So they couldn't tax their population at will.

1:32:20.180 --> 1:32:22.860
 And it's very difficult to take money from people.

1:32:22.860 --> 1:32:25.620
 You know, you go knock on doors and search everybody's home,

1:32:25.620 --> 1:32:27.260
 see where they're hiding their gold.

1:32:27.260 --> 1:32:28.620
 It's very complicated.

1:32:28.620 --> 1:32:30.220
 On the other hand, when you gave them paper money,

1:32:30.220 --> 1:32:33.220
 which is what the case was in 1914,

1:32:33.220 --> 1:32:36.220
 you could take their wealth just by printing the money.

1:32:36.220 --> 1:32:38.780
 And that's what changed everything when it comes to war.

1:32:38.780 --> 1:32:41.980
 That's why the 20th century was the century of total war.

1:32:41.980 --> 1:32:43.220
 Because under the gold standard,

1:32:43.220 --> 1:32:46.420
 governments fought until they ran out of their own gold.

1:32:46.420 --> 1:32:48.700
 Under the fiat standard, with paper money,

1:32:48.700 --> 1:32:50.900
 with credit money, governments fought

1:32:50.900 --> 1:32:53.480
 until they ran out of liquid wealth

1:32:53.480 --> 1:32:55.840
 in the hands of all of their citizens.

1:32:55.840 --> 1:33:00.840
 So let's find flaws in this thinking if there's any.

1:33:01.460 --> 1:33:06.460
 Okay, there's a lot of pacifist type of thinking

1:33:06.460 --> 1:33:10.020
 in World War II as Hitler was expanding and expanding.

1:33:10.020 --> 1:33:14.660
 Hitler framed himself as a victim of the past, of history.

1:33:14.660 --> 1:33:16.940
 He never attacked anybody.

1:33:16.940 --> 1:33:18.940
 Everyone's always threatening to attack him.

1:33:18.940 --> 1:33:20.140
 That's kind of the narrative.

1:33:20.140 --> 1:33:21.580
 And he keeps expanding.

1:33:21.580 --> 1:33:23.660
 He keeps sweet talking with his charisma,

1:33:23.660 --> 1:33:25.940
 all the countries around him,

1:33:25.940 --> 1:33:28.820
 into sort of embracing pacifism.

1:33:28.820 --> 1:33:31.820
 Stay out of the war until the war is on your doorstep.

1:33:31.820 --> 1:33:36.820
 So France, just very suboptimal military strategy

1:33:37.380 --> 1:33:39.940
 from the perspective of many European nations

1:33:39.940 --> 1:33:41.860
 in response to Hitler.

1:33:41.860 --> 1:33:45.620
 They were basically hoodwinked by his words.

1:33:45.620 --> 1:33:50.620
 So then there's Churchill, Winston Churchill,

1:33:50.640 --> 1:33:55.300
 who stepped up and says, perhaps irrationally,

1:33:55.300 --> 1:33:57.860
 from some kind of economics perspective,

1:33:57.860 --> 1:33:59.900
 saying we're not going to back down.

1:33:59.900 --> 1:34:01.580
 We're going to fight Germany.

1:34:01.580 --> 1:34:05.220
 And perhaps that step alone is one of the biggest reasons

1:34:05.220 --> 1:34:09.140
 that Hitler failed in his expansion.

1:34:11.380 --> 1:34:13.580
 That decision to fight back,

1:34:15.840 --> 1:34:18.780
 how, what's the right way to do that?

1:34:18.780 --> 1:34:20.400
 If you're Winston Churchill,

1:34:21.260 --> 1:34:23.320
 what's the right way to do that?

1:34:23.320 --> 1:34:28.320
 If you're, to fight back evil when violence is required.

1:34:28.320 --> 1:34:30.440
 Evil when violence is required.

1:34:30.440 --> 1:34:35.440
 Now, you could argue that no war is just,

1:34:35.440 --> 1:34:38.840
 but there is such a thing as a just war index.

1:34:38.840 --> 1:34:41.920
 And a lot of people argue if there is a just war

1:34:41.920 --> 1:34:44.880
 in the 20th century, it's World War II.

1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:49.800
 So how would you fund, if you were Britain, the war?

1:34:49.800 --> 1:34:52.200
 Would you require Winston Churchill

1:34:52.200 --> 1:34:54.800
 to convince the populace?

1:34:54.800 --> 1:34:57.480
 Don't fight until they're fully convinced

1:34:57.480 --> 1:34:59.120
 that this is the right thing to do.

1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:01.240
 You can't just make a decision for them.

1:35:01.240 --> 1:35:02.960
 You have to convince them fully

1:35:02.960 --> 1:35:04.400
 so that they give their life

1:35:04.400 --> 1:35:07.760
 and they give their money to support the war.

1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:08.720
 Is that the right way to do it?

1:35:08.720 --> 1:35:09.560
 I think so.

1:35:09.560 --> 1:35:13.280
 And I think when you have a true threat

1:35:13.280 --> 1:35:14.760
 and a true evil and a true force

1:35:14.760 --> 1:35:18.300
 that people really do think is genuine,

1:35:18.300 --> 1:35:19.360
 you don't need to convince them.

1:35:19.360 --> 1:35:22.760
 I mean, when it's real, people will want to fight

1:35:22.760 --> 1:35:24.440
 and people will want to pay to fight.

1:35:24.440 --> 1:35:28.880
 And I mean, I think, though, on this particular example,

1:35:28.880 --> 1:35:30.680
 I think the best way to fight Hitler

1:35:30.680 --> 1:35:33.400
 is to have not fought World War I

1:35:33.400 --> 1:35:36.080
 and not take out the Kaiser of Germany.

1:35:36.080 --> 1:35:40.120
 If Britain and the US had not gotten involved

1:35:40.120 --> 1:35:44.560
 in World War I, which really is the senseless war

1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:46.600
 about nothing, what was in it?

1:35:46.600 --> 1:35:49.600
 And what was the goal from anybody fighting that war?

1:35:49.600 --> 1:35:52.360
 If you look at it, after World War I,

1:35:52.360 --> 1:35:54.800
 there were very minor adjustments

1:35:54.800 --> 1:35:57.640
 in the borders of the countries that were participating.

1:35:57.640 --> 1:36:00.840
 So Germany lost some land, Austria lost some land,

1:36:00.840 --> 1:36:04.320
 but really it wasn't all that massive.

1:36:04.320 --> 1:36:09.320
 And it wasn't like Britain wanted to take over Germany

1:36:09.320 --> 1:36:12.040
 and move their people into Germany and kick the Germans out.

1:36:12.040 --> 1:36:17.040
 So there was no real value from that war.

1:36:17.160 --> 1:36:18.100
 And that's why the British people

1:36:18.100 --> 1:36:19.960
 didn't want to take part in it.

1:36:19.960 --> 1:36:22.760
 And that's why if they hadn't done

1:36:22.760 --> 1:36:25.560
 this enormously criminal manipulation

1:36:25.560 --> 1:36:28.520
 of printing money to buy the bonds,

1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:30.720
 Britain wouldn't have gotten into the war.

1:36:30.720 --> 1:36:34.520
 Germany would still be a kingdom and Hitler wouldn't rise.

1:36:34.520 --> 1:36:37.240
 And yeah, there'd be small changes

1:36:37.240 --> 1:36:41.440
 in the borders of various European countries.

1:36:41.440 --> 1:36:44.800
 I struggled to see how it could have been worse.

1:36:44.800 --> 1:36:47.900
 I mean, I struggled to see who benefited

1:36:47.900 --> 1:36:50.800
 from four years of carnage in Europe.

1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:53.620
 And then this came at the height of civilization.

1:36:53.620 --> 1:36:55.640
 Before that, the people of Europe

1:36:55.640 --> 1:37:00.160
 had the golden era under the gold standard.

1:37:00.160 --> 1:37:02.000
 They were trading with one another, they traveled

1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:04.400
 and technology was advancing.

1:37:04.400 --> 1:37:08.760
 And they did not expect this war to last this long.

1:37:08.760 --> 1:37:11.360
 And my favorite story from World War I

1:37:11.360 --> 1:37:14.840
 is the Christmas truce football game,

1:37:14.840 --> 1:37:16.480
 which I mentioned in my book.

1:37:16.480 --> 1:37:19.640
 British and German soldiers at the height of the conflict,

1:37:19.640 --> 1:37:20.760
 they stopped on Christmas day

1:37:20.760 --> 1:37:23.120
 and they played a football game against each other.

1:37:23.120 --> 1:37:25.100
 I mean, this is not a real war,

1:37:25.100 --> 1:37:27.680
 where it's a war for survival.

1:37:27.680 --> 1:37:30.340
 Britain didn't want to end Germany.

1:37:30.340 --> 1:37:31.840
 Germany didn't want to end Britain.

1:37:31.840 --> 1:37:35.920
 It was just kings who were emboldened

1:37:35.920 --> 1:37:38.440
 by the fact that they had a printing press

1:37:38.440 --> 1:37:40.240
 playing with the lives of the people.

1:37:42.720 --> 1:37:44.640
 Take that away, take away the printing press,

1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:46.360
 take away their ability to print money.

1:37:46.360 --> 1:37:49.480
 I think we'd have had a much, much, much better

1:37:49.480 --> 1:37:50.960
 20th century.

1:37:50.960 --> 1:37:52.520
 Yeah, the counterfactual history.

1:37:52.520 --> 1:37:54.080
 Neil Ferguson is a historian

1:37:54.080 --> 1:37:56.060
 who gets in quite a bit of trouble.

1:37:56.960 --> 1:38:00.220
 Basically, well, he's a Brit,

1:38:00.220 --> 1:38:03.440
 suggesting that if Britain stayed out of World War I,

1:38:03.440 --> 1:38:05.980
 there would be no Hitler, there would be no World War II.

1:38:05.980 --> 1:38:07.540
 Yep, I agree entirely.

1:38:09.140 --> 1:38:10.620
 But fiat money.

1:38:10.620 --> 1:38:12.280
 Yeah, so how fiat money was born.

1:38:12.280 --> 1:38:13.560
 Yeah, let's get back to that.

1:38:13.560 --> 1:38:16.160
 So they financed the war with that money.

1:38:16.160 --> 1:38:17.960
 So what could go wrong?

1:38:17.960 --> 1:38:19.220
 That's where we left off.

1:38:19.220 --> 1:38:21.240
 Well, what could go wrong when you've just printed

1:38:21.240 --> 1:38:26.240
 an enormous amount of credit and used it to buy bonds?

1:38:26.760 --> 1:38:28.560
 What goes wrong is that the value of the currency

1:38:28.560 --> 1:38:29.600
 is going to go down.

1:38:29.600 --> 1:38:32.880
 Or in other words, prices of things are gonna go up.

1:38:32.880 --> 1:38:35.240
 So during the war, prices keep going up.

1:38:35.240 --> 1:38:38.040
 And this is, of course,

1:38:38.040 --> 1:38:39.240
 this is gonna sound very familiar

1:38:39.240 --> 1:38:41.560
 to victims of the 20th century.

1:38:41.560 --> 1:38:43.400
 A government tells you it's because of the war,

1:38:43.400 --> 1:38:45.240
 it's not our fault, it's because of the Germans,

1:38:45.240 --> 1:38:47.120
 it's because of the foreigners, it's because of Putin,

1:38:47.120 --> 1:38:49.120
 it's because of this, it's because of that.

1:38:49.120 --> 1:38:50.280
 This has always been the case.

1:38:50.280 --> 1:38:55.080
 There's always, war is a very good cover for inflation,

1:38:55.080 --> 1:38:57.880
 which is caused by monetary phenomena.

1:38:57.880 --> 1:38:59.720
 So then the war ends.

1:38:59.720 --> 1:39:02.640
 And inflation, prices have more than doubled

1:39:02.640 --> 1:39:04.760
 over the past four years,

1:39:04.760 --> 1:39:07.640
 over the four years of World War I,

1:39:07.640 --> 1:39:09.420
 prices have more than doubled.

1:39:09.420 --> 1:39:12.800
 And then the British economy is in bad trouble,

1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:16.360
 obviously, lost a lot of the labor force for four years

1:39:16.360 --> 1:39:18.280
 that was out there fighting.

1:39:18.280 --> 1:39:23.200
 Now those workers come back, you've got prices are up.

1:39:23.200 --> 1:39:25.960
 And so people are demanding

1:39:25.960 --> 1:39:27.280
 that the government control prices

1:39:27.280 --> 1:39:29.440
 and the government is trying to fix the problem

1:39:29.440 --> 1:39:31.000
 of inflation by doing price controls,

1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:32.840
 which is what they always do,

1:39:32.840 --> 1:39:36.040
 which is catastrophic because it makes things worse.

1:39:36.040 --> 1:39:38.560
 When you implement price controls,

1:39:38.560 --> 1:39:40.840
 you are, when you make, you say, all right,

1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:45.400
 well, bread can't be sold for more than X price.

1:39:45.400 --> 1:39:48.200
 Well, that's just preventing bread producers

1:39:48.200 --> 1:39:49.920
 from producing a lot of bread.

1:39:49.920 --> 1:39:51.560
 And that's just making the problem worse.

1:39:51.560 --> 1:39:55.160
 If you let the price rise, the extra price,

1:39:55.160 --> 1:39:56.840
 first of all, it makes people economize,

1:39:56.840 --> 1:39:58.760
 so people will only buy what they need.

1:39:58.760 --> 1:40:00.800
 And it provides the money for the bread producers

1:40:00.800 --> 1:40:03.240
 to acquire the capital and the resources

1:40:03.240 --> 1:40:04.840
 they need to produce more bread,

1:40:04.840 --> 1:40:06.480
 which then brings the price of bread down.

1:40:06.480 --> 1:40:08.520
 But price controls destroy that.

1:40:08.520 --> 1:40:10.640
 Then they also implement wage controls.

1:40:10.640 --> 1:40:15.160
 So you wanna also make sure that people have high wages.

1:40:15.160 --> 1:40:17.080
 So you raise people's wages artificially,

1:40:17.080 --> 1:40:18.600
 you lower prices artificially,

1:40:18.600 --> 1:40:21.240
 and you cause an economic problem.

1:40:21.240 --> 1:40:24.960
 And this is basically, I use this historical example

1:40:24.960 --> 1:40:26.680
 because it's the birth of fiat,

1:40:26.680 --> 1:40:28.560
 because the Bank of England was the most important

1:40:28.560 --> 1:40:30.720
 monetary system in the world at that time.

1:40:31.640 --> 1:40:33.560
 And because it's the prototype

1:40:33.560 --> 1:40:35.120
 that basically the entire planet copied

1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:36.200
 over the last 100 years.

1:40:36.200 --> 1:40:38.120
 We've had this same thing happen.

1:40:38.120 --> 1:40:40.280
 The government prints money because of a stupid reason,

1:40:40.280 --> 1:40:42.240
 because somebody in power decided

1:40:42.240 --> 1:40:44.800
 this was worth destroying everybody's livelihood

1:40:44.800 --> 1:40:46.160
 and savings for.

1:40:46.160 --> 1:40:47.600
 And then the consequences come in

1:40:47.600 --> 1:40:49.800
 and then they start covering up with price controls,

1:40:49.800 --> 1:40:52.760
 wage controls, and then that makes things worse.

1:40:52.760 --> 1:40:57.480
 And then they, and of course, throughout all of that,

1:40:57.480 --> 1:40:58.840
 they're promising that we're going to go,

1:40:58.840 --> 1:41:01.240
 oh, and also the other thing that they did,

1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:03.080
 which I mentioned in the chapter is,

1:41:03.080 --> 1:41:05.320
 they stopped people from using physical gold

1:41:05.320 --> 1:41:07.480
 and they confiscated the, well, they didn't confiscate it,

1:41:07.480 --> 1:41:10.040
 but they took the physical gold and they gave people paper.

1:41:10.040 --> 1:41:12.240
 So I call it the fiat white paper.

1:41:12.240 --> 1:41:14.960
 You know, in Bitcoin, we have the white paper.

1:41:14.960 --> 1:41:17.360
 The fiat white paper was that the Bank of England

1:41:17.360 --> 1:41:20.040
 announced to all of its banks and post offices.

1:41:20.040 --> 1:41:23.200
 And from now on, you should not make payment in gold

1:41:23.200 --> 1:41:24.920
 and you should take payment in gold

1:41:24.920 --> 1:41:26.320
 and you should encourage all your customers

1:41:26.320 --> 1:41:28.640
 to turn in all of their gold and give them paper instead.

1:41:28.640 --> 1:41:30.040
 Is there an actual document?

1:41:30.040 --> 1:41:30.880
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:41:30.880 --> 1:41:31.720
 Nice.

1:41:31.720 --> 1:41:33.400
 Yeah, it was, this is all new stuff.

1:41:33.400 --> 1:41:35.360
 Obviously, nobody really likes to talk about this stuff

1:41:35.360 --> 1:41:36.880
 because, you know, they're fiat economists,

1:41:36.880 --> 1:41:41.160
 so they don't wanna talk about the original sin, but.

1:41:41.160 --> 1:41:42.880
 Well, you should like republish it

1:41:42.880 --> 1:41:45.160
 as the fiat white paper or something like that.

1:41:45.160 --> 1:41:49.680
 There's a fascinating book by a guy called John Osborne.

1:41:49.680 --> 1:41:53.120
 So in the 1920s, I think his name was Montagu.

1:41:53.120 --> 1:41:54.800
 He was the chief of the Bank of England.

1:41:54.800 --> 1:41:58.600
 He commissioned one of his secretaries, John Osborne,

1:41:58.600 --> 1:42:02.520
 to study what the bank did during World War I.

1:42:02.520 --> 1:42:05.200
 And it was a study that was kept under wraps,

1:42:05.200 --> 1:42:07.720
 a confidential, in the Bank of England,

1:42:07.720 --> 1:42:12.160
 only released in 2017, almost a century later.

1:42:12.160 --> 1:42:13.000
 And.

1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:15.800
 What was special about 2017, by the way, it's a year.

1:42:15.800 --> 1:42:17.920
 It's just it was a year in which

1:42:17.920 --> 1:42:19.840
 some of this information was released.

1:42:19.840 --> 1:42:22.320
 Yeah, a bunch of people got into parts of the basements

1:42:22.320 --> 1:42:24.400
 of the Bank of England and found this and published it

1:42:24.400 --> 1:42:26.160
 and now you can download it as a PDF

1:42:26.160 --> 1:42:28.680
 and find all of the amazing details.

1:42:29.520 --> 1:42:31.480
 So they confiscated the gold

1:42:31.480 --> 1:42:32.960
 and they forced people to use the paper

1:42:32.960 --> 1:42:34.560
 and they promised people that as soon as the war

1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:36.360
 was gonna be over, this is temporary,

1:42:36.360 --> 1:42:38.240
 we're gonna be back to using gold.

1:42:38.240 --> 1:42:42.000
 And of course, you know, if you told people in Britain,

1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:43.920
 this is the real scam about fiat.

1:42:43.920 --> 1:42:47.040
 If you told people in Britain in 1914,

1:42:47.040 --> 1:42:49.040
 hey, we're gonna go off the gold standard

1:42:49.040 --> 1:42:50.320
 because it's better.

1:42:50.320 --> 1:42:53.360
 I mean, there might've been lynchings

1:42:53.360 --> 1:42:56.720
 of government officials because the British pound

1:42:56.720 --> 1:43:00.560
 at that point, it had been the global currency

1:43:00.560 --> 1:43:01.600
 of the whole world.

1:43:01.600 --> 1:43:04.800
 And the fact that they'd managed,

1:43:04.800 --> 1:43:07.120
 the Bank of England had kept the British pound

1:43:07.120 --> 1:43:09.920
 at a fixed rate next to gold for,

1:43:09.920 --> 1:43:12.120
 since Newton, you know, the exchange rate,

1:43:12.120 --> 1:43:14.560
 the value of the British pound was set

1:43:14.560 --> 1:43:16.440
 by Isaac Newton himself.

1:43:16.440 --> 1:43:18.600
 He was the warden of the mint

1:43:18.600 --> 1:43:22.160
 and he made the pound a specific amount of gold.

1:43:22.160 --> 1:43:24.760
 And since then, up until World War I,

1:43:24.760 --> 1:43:28.600
 it was 4.25 pounds per ounce of gold.

1:43:28.600 --> 1:43:31.480
 I think I might be wrong, but I have it in the book.

1:43:31.480 --> 1:43:32.760
 So he'd set that price.

1:43:32.760 --> 1:43:34.240
 And it was a matter of national pride

1:43:34.240 --> 1:43:35.960
 for people in England, you know.

1:43:35.960 --> 1:43:37.600
 The sterling is as good as gold

1:43:37.600 --> 1:43:40.360
 because for two centuries it has been stuck to gold.

1:43:40.360 --> 1:43:42.440
 There was the exception of the Napoleonic Wars,

1:43:42.440 --> 1:43:45.240
 but for two centuries, mostly it was stuck to that.

1:43:45.240 --> 1:43:49.200
 And so they went off that and then they couldn't go back

1:43:49.200 --> 1:43:50.320
 because if they wanted to go back,

1:43:50.320 --> 1:43:51.320
 they didn't have enough gold.

1:43:51.320 --> 1:43:54.720
 They shipped their gold to the US to finance the war.

1:43:54.720 --> 1:43:56.840
 And they had printed a whole bunch of money

1:43:56.840 --> 1:43:58.080
 that was out there.

1:43:58.080 --> 1:44:01.280
 So this begins the problem for England.

1:44:01.280 --> 1:44:03.120
 And that begins the end of England

1:44:03.120 --> 1:44:05.120
 as the world's superpower.

1:44:05.120 --> 1:44:06.560
 And the way they tried to fight that

1:44:06.560 --> 1:44:08.560
 was to get more and more countries around the world

1:44:08.560 --> 1:44:10.640
 to establish central banks and have,

1:44:10.640 --> 1:44:12.200
 and hold British pounds.

1:44:12.200 --> 1:44:15.640
 So they'd hold, you know, basically dumping their bags

1:44:15.640 --> 1:44:17.840
 like just any other shit coin.

1:44:17.840 --> 1:44:20.040
 You just, if you get people to buy your shit coin,

1:44:20.040 --> 1:44:21.840
 you know, that raises the value of your shit coin.

1:44:21.840 --> 1:44:22.680
 So.

1:44:22.680 --> 1:44:23.920
 Can you define shit coin?

1:44:23.920 --> 1:44:27.000
 Shit coin is, in my definition of a shit coin

1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:28.720
 is that it's any form of money

1:44:28.720 --> 1:44:31.360
 where somebody can produce it.

1:44:31.360 --> 1:44:32.360
 So soft money.

1:44:33.320 --> 1:44:35.080
 Not necessarily, I guess.

1:44:35.080 --> 1:44:38.160
 I think the difference, so there's easy money,

1:44:38.160 --> 1:44:42.120
 but the shit coin is something that someone can produce

1:44:42.120 --> 1:44:45.200
 at a rate that is, at a cost that is different

1:44:45.200 --> 1:44:46.520
 from the market cost.

1:44:46.520 --> 1:44:49.520
 So gold, nobody can make gold except if they dig for it.

1:44:49.520 --> 1:44:52.520
 And the cost of mining gold is generally in the range

1:44:52.520 --> 1:44:53.640
 of the price of gold.

1:44:54.640 --> 1:44:56.400
 Seems true for Bitcoin.

1:44:56.400 --> 1:44:57.800
 So gold is not a shit coin.

1:44:57.800 --> 1:44:59.360
 Gold is not a shit coin.

1:44:59.360 --> 1:45:00.640
 The copper is.

1:45:00.640 --> 1:45:03.000
 Copper, I'm not so sure.

1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:04.320
 I wouldn't call copper a shit coin

1:45:04.320 --> 1:45:05.800
 as much as it is easy money.

1:45:05.800 --> 1:45:09.800
 But I think government currencies and other alt coins,

1:45:09.800 --> 1:45:13.080
 I think are shit coins because somebody could click a button

1:45:13.080 --> 1:45:14.960
 and make 10 times the supply.

1:45:14.960 --> 1:45:18.040
 Would it be fair to say that this began

1:45:19.040 --> 1:45:23.120
 with the will for war in World War I?

1:45:23.120 --> 1:45:28.120
 So the march towards fiat began

1:45:30.160 --> 1:45:35.160
 with a global desire for war in the 20th century.

1:45:35.840 --> 1:45:39.680
 Did war start this or was war a result?

1:45:39.680 --> 1:45:40.840
 It's difficult to say really.

1:45:40.840 --> 1:45:42.200
 I think it goes both ways.

1:45:42.200 --> 1:45:47.200
 I think you can't have permanent war without fiat.

1:45:48.320 --> 1:45:51.720
 And I also think there's a case to be made

1:45:51.720 --> 1:45:54.720
 that you can't really have fiat without war.

1:45:54.720 --> 1:45:57.480
 So it's some kind of weird dynamical system

1:45:57.480 --> 1:45:59.360
 with a chicken and egg situation

1:45:59.360 --> 1:46:00.800
 and they build on top of each other

1:46:00.800 --> 1:46:03.000
 and there's a few individuals that figured out

1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:05.840
 there's a way to manipulate this to play this kind of game

1:46:05.840 --> 1:46:08.840
 and it escalates and nothing gives you the ability

1:46:08.840 --> 1:46:12.200
 to manipulate money quite like war.

1:46:12.200 --> 1:46:15.520
 When you have a war, you can declare an emergency.

1:46:15.520 --> 1:46:19.360
 You can call all the people who oppose you traitors.

1:46:19.360 --> 1:46:23.640
 You can get people to support you

1:46:23.640 --> 1:46:25.400
 not because what you're doing is good

1:46:25.400 --> 1:46:28.240
 but because you play on their sense of tribalism.

1:46:28.240 --> 1:46:31.000
 In your book, you do cost benefit analysis.

1:46:31.000 --> 1:46:33.240
 So you do acknowledge or think about

1:46:33.240 --> 1:46:35.440
 the pros of fiat currency.

1:46:35.440 --> 1:46:40.440
 Can you do just that, look at the benefit

1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:43.880
 and look at the cost just broadly at the highest level?

1:46:43.880 --> 1:46:45.640
 So the way that I write the fiat standard

1:46:45.640 --> 1:46:49.440
 is that I try and analyze it as an engineering system

1:46:49.440 --> 1:46:51.480
 in the same way that I wrote the Bitcoin standard.

1:46:51.480 --> 1:46:52.320
 So with the Bitcoin standard,

1:46:52.320 --> 1:46:54.040
 I looked at Bitcoin from first principles

1:46:54.040 --> 1:46:56.080
 and tried to explain how it works

1:46:56.080 --> 1:46:59.320
 for a reader that doesn't really have much of a background

1:46:59.320 --> 1:47:03.760
 in computer science, networks or economics.

1:47:03.760 --> 1:47:05.520
 And I thought I'll do the same with the fiat.

1:47:05.520 --> 1:47:07.480
 Let's just ignore the official stories

1:47:07.480 --> 1:47:10.280
 and look at how this thing actually works.

1:47:10.280 --> 1:47:14.000
 And I think it does have value

1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:18.080
 in the fact that the reason that they were able

1:47:18.080 --> 1:47:21.440
 to pull it off is because it was not possible

1:47:21.440 --> 1:47:25.520
 for people who don't want to be part of it

1:47:25.520 --> 1:47:28.000
 to use gold independently of governments.

1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:29.480
 This is really the key thing.

1:47:29.480 --> 1:47:31.840
 Gold is just very expensive to move around.

1:47:31.840 --> 1:47:36.040
 And the fact that it is expensive to move around

1:47:36.040 --> 1:47:41.040
 means that there's inevitably going to emerge institutions

1:47:41.040 --> 1:47:44.280
 where it is centralized in physical location.

1:47:44.280 --> 1:47:47.840
 And then these institutions trade liabilities for the gold.

1:47:47.840 --> 1:47:52.840
 So really the gold standard intrinsically must involve credit

1:47:55.520 --> 1:47:58.120
 as becoming part of the monetary system.

1:47:58.120 --> 1:48:00.840
 It has to be the credit and because it gets centralized

1:48:00.840 --> 1:48:03.080
 it can easily be captured by the government.

1:48:03.080 --> 1:48:06.920
 So to be fair, the benefits of the fiat system

1:48:06.920 --> 1:48:09.520
 is that it saves us on the cost of moving gold around,

1:48:09.520 --> 1:48:11.240
 which is pretty significant.

1:48:11.240 --> 1:48:15.000
 Like generally, moving a bar of gold across the Atlantic

1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:18.160
 is gonna cost somewhere between 0.1 to 1%

1:48:18.160 --> 1:48:19.920
 of the cost of the gold bar.

1:48:19.920 --> 1:48:22.640
 So you move it 100 times back and forth

1:48:22.640 --> 1:48:25.320
 between the Atlantic, you need to pay the whole gold bar,

1:48:25.320 --> 1:48:28.400
 the cost of the whole gold bar to move it 100 times across.

1:48:28.400 --> 1:48:31.280
 Well, with fiat money, it's essentially government credit.

1:48:31.280 --> 1:48:33.600
 And so it's just sending a message

1:48:33.600 --> 1:48:36.120
 from one central bank to another

1:48:36.120 --> 1:48:38.160
 and you can move it halfway around the world.

1:48:38.160 --> 1:48:41.240
 Is there also something to be said about the cost in time?

1:48:41.240 --> 1:48:42.640
 So you're saving the sort of,

1:48:42.640 --> 1:48:45.920
 you're reducing the friction of the communication as well.

1:48:45.920 --> 1:48:46.760
 Exactly.

1:48:46.760 --> 1:48:47.880
 Of the transactions as well.

1:48:47.880 --> 1:48:49.080
 Exactly, it's faster.

1:48:50.480 --> 1:48:52.000
 How big is that benefit?

1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:54.280
 Because wouldn't you argue that that potential

1:48:54.280 --> 1:48:56.680
 is the thing that enables modern economy,

1:48:56.680 --> 1:48:58.400
 both the speed and the low cost,

1:48:58.400 --> 1:49:01.240
 so increasing the scale and the frequency,

1:49:01.240 --> 1:49:03.160
 the speed of the transactions?

1:49:03.160 --> 1:49:06.680
 Yeah, arguably it does help in that regard.

1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:10.160
 However, it isn't as if you couldn't have

1:49:10.160 --> 1:49:12.400
 fast transactions built on top of gold.

1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:15.360
 So you could have gold being used for final settlement

1:49:15.360 --> 1:49:19.600
 and you could have banks settling with one another

1:49:19.600 --> 1:49:21.040
 essentially using credit settlement.

1:49:21.040 --> 1:49:24.120
 Can you define settlement just for people

1:49:24.120 --> 1:49:25.360
 who are outside of this world?

1:49:25.360 --> 1:49:27.360
 Because we'll mention that word quite a bit probably.

1:49:27.360 --> 1:49:28.200
 Good question.

1:49:28.200 --> 1:49:29.920
 So the way that it works is, let's say right now

1:49:29.920 --> 1:49:35.080
 I'm gonna pay you $10 over PayPal or credit card.

1:49:35.080 --> 1:49:37.040
 So it shows up in your PayPal or credit card

1:49:37.040 --> 1:49:39.960
 within a few seconds that I've sent you the money

1:49:39.960 --> 1:49:41.200
 and then that's yours.

1:49:41.200 --> 1:49:46.200
 But it didn't also happen in those 10 seconds

1:49:46.600 --> 1:49:49.840
 that my bank, which could be in another country,

1:49:49.840 --> 1:49:52.960
 sent the money to your bank into your account.

1:49:54.760 --> 1:49:57.160
 There's a lot of infrastructure underneath that.

1:49:57.160 --> 1:49:59.160
 So what actually happened is that I have an account

1:49:59.160 --> 1:50:01.600
 with my bank and you have an account with your bank.

1:50:01.600 --> 1:50:05.560
 And when the message is communicated from my app to yours,

1:50:05.560 --> 1:50:07.560
 my bank crosses out the money

1:50:07.560 --> 1:50:10.080
 and your bank credits you with the money.

1:50:10.080 --> 1:50:13.440
 And then at the end of the day, week or month,

1:50:14.400 --> 1:50:16.560
 banks in the same city will settle with one another,

1:50:16.560 --> 1:50:19.520
 banks in the same country will settle with one another

1:50:19.520 --> 1:50:21.720
 and banks from different countries

1:50:21.720 --> 1:50:22.880
 will settle with one another.

1:50:22.880 --> 1:50:27.040
 So they won't move the $10 from my account to yours.

1:50:27.040 --> 1:50:29.600
 At the end of the day or week or month,

1:50:29.600 --> 1:50:32.200
 they'll tally all of the money that was sent

1:50:32.200 --> 1:50:33.880
 from one bank to the other

1:50:33.880 --> 1:50:35.320
 and then just settle the difference.

1:50:35.320 --> 1:50:37.080
 So it turns out at the end of the month,

1:50:37.080 --> 1:50:40.440
 my bank had sent $15 million to your bank

1:50:40.440 --> 1:50:43.480
 and your bank had sent $14 million to my bank.

1:50:43.480 --> 1:50:46.840
 So they give them $1 million and that settles it,

1:50:46.840 --> 1:50:48.920
 that finalizes the transaction.

1:50:48.920 --> 1:50:51.680
 So final settlement 3D is like the,

1:50:51.680 --> 1:50:54.640
 you can think about it as the infrastructure of the system.

1:50:54.640 --> 1:50:56.840
 And then you can think of these things

1:50:56.840 --> 1:50:59.360
 as being the higher layer levels.

1:50:59.360 --> 1:51:01.080
 And you had a wonderful discussion about that

1:51:01.080 --> 1:51:02.720
 with Michael Saylor.

1:51:02.720 --> 1:51:05.960
 So the final settlement is like the moment

1:51:05.960 --> 1:51:09.960
 when you paper and ideas connect to physical reality.

1:51:11.880 --> 1:51:13.760
 Or to some representation of physical reality.

1:51:13.760 --> 1:51:15.560
 Yeah, and under gold,

1:51:15.560 --> 1:51:17.720
 everything was tethered to physical reality

1:51:17.720 --> 1:51:19.080
 because there was a market commodity

1:51:19.080 --> 1:51:20.520
 at the bottom of all of this

1:51:20.520 --> 1:51:22.440
 and nobody could print that market commodity.

1:51:22.440 --> 1:51:23.960
 And so at the end of the month,

1:51:23.960 --> 1:51:26.240
 if your bank made too many payments,

1:51:26.240 --> 1:51:29.040
 if you made too many payments, there was a reckoning.

1:51:29.040 --> 1:51:33.040
 If you were reckless, if you were insolvent,

1:51:33.040 --> 1:51:34.440
 you went out of business.

1:51:34.440 --> 1:51:37.640
 So there was no way to fool that.

1:51:37.640 --> 1:51:39.840
 But then we moved to the fiat century

1:51:39.840 --> 1:51:41.840
 and everything is credit.

1:51:41.840 --> 1:51:42.680
 At the end of the day,

1:51:42.680 --> 1:51:45.680
 the final layer is government credit.

1:51:45.680 --> 1:51:48.600
 And so as long as you're friends with the government,

1:51:48.600 --> 1:51:50.280
 basically you never go bankrupt.

1:51:50.280 --> 1:51:54.200
 So all kinds of hucksters managed to find their way

1:51:54.200 --> 1:51:58.840
 into getting into position where they don't get bankrupt.

1:51:58.840 --> 1:52:03.000
 So in part two of the fiat standard called Fiat Life,

1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:04.640
 you describe the effects of fiat money

1:52:04.640 --> 1:52:08.880
 on a bunch of things like life, food, science, education.

1:52:10.640 --> 1:52:14.040
 What is the most pernicious effect of fiat money

1:52:14.040 --> 1:52:15.440
 on our world, on our life?

1:52:15.440 --> 1:52:18.160
 So taking a step outside of the monetary system,

1:52:18.160 --> 1:52:21.800
 actually like how that affects our life from this book?

1:52:21.800 --> 1:52:23.480
 I mean, there's a whole bunch of things

1:52:23.480 --> 1:52:25.440
 and I won't be able to go over them

1:52:25.440 --> 1:52:26.840
 and I highly recommend reading the book.

1:52:26.840 --> 1:52:28.520
 But if I were to pick one,

1:52:28.520 --> 1:52:29.880
 I would say it's the impact that it has

1:52:29.880 --> 1:52:33.640
 on our time preference, on our valuation of the future.

1:52:33.640 --> 1:52:35.680
 So remember when we started the discussion,

1:52:35.680 --> 1:52:38.840
 I said that the key function of money

1:52:38.840 --> 1:52:41.400
 is that it serves as a store of value.

1:52:41.400 --> 1:52:42.920
 And the harder the money is,

1:52:42.920 --> 1:52:45.240
 the better it is at providing us

1:52:45.240 --> 1:52:48.160
 with a way for providing for our future.

1:52:48.160 --> 1:52:49.800
 And so the harder the money is,

1:52:49.800 --> 1:52:51.320
 the less we discount the future.

1:52:51.320 --> 1:52:53.200
 We always discount the future compared to the present.

1:52:53.200 --> 1:52:56.200
 So if I told you, I'm gonna give you something today

1:52:56.200 --> 1:52:58.640
 versus giving it to you 10 years from now,

1:52:58.640 --> 1:53:00.840
 the same thing, you would prefer to take it now

1:53:00.840 --> 1:53:03.240
 because then you'd get to enjoy it over the next 10 years.

1:53:03.240 --> 1:53:06.520
 So we always prefer the present to the future.

1:53:06.520 --> 1:53:09.080
 There's always a discount on the future.

1:53:09.080 --> 1:53:10.920
 And that discount is called time preference.

1:53:10.920 --> 1:53:13.600
 The degree to which we prefer the present to the future

1:53:13.600 --> 1:53:15.400
 is called our time preference.

1:53:15.400 --> 1:53:18.960
 So the higher our time preference,

1:53:18.960 --> 1:53:20.840
 the less we care about the future.

1:53:20.840 --> 1:53:22.200
 And the process of civilization

1:53:22.200 --> 1:53:24.680
 is the process of lowering our time preference,

1:53:24.680 --> 1:53:26.600
 where we start caring more for the future,

1:53:26.600 --> 1:53:29.680
 we start prioritizing the present less and less.

1:53:29.680 --> 1:53:32.880
 So we start being able to not consume everything

1:53:32.880 --> 1:53:34.800
 that we have and store it.

1:53:34.800 --> 1:53:36.640
 And so money is essential for that.

1:53:36.640 --> 1:53:38.640
 And under the gold standard,

1:53:38.640 --> 1:53:40.680
 everyone in the world had the ability

1:53:40.680 --> 1:53:42.360
 to provide for their future

1:53:42.360 --> 1:53:44.400
 by simply using the same money that they use.

1:53:44.400 --> 1:53:47.560
 You would work a day and you would get paid in a gold coin

1:53:47.560 --> 1:53:49.080
 and you could take that gold coin

1:53:49.080 --> 1:53:51.720
 and keep it safe for 10 years

1:53:51.720 --> 1:53:54.000
 and know that at the end of those 10 years,

1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:56.720
 that gold coin would buy you slightly more

1:53:56.720 --> 1:53:59.400
 than what it bought you the day that you earned it.

1:53:59.400 --> 1:54:01.480
 So anybody could provide for their future

1:54:01.480 --> 1:54:04.640
 and anybody could have very high degree of certainty

1:54:04.640 --> 1:54:08.160
 that whatever they're saving is going to be there

1:54:08.160 --> 1:54:10.320
 when they want it in the future.

1:54:10.320 --> 1:54:12.000
 Because the money supply was only increasing

1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:13.480
 at one and a half percent,

1:54:13.480 --> 1:54:16.880
 whereas the production of goods and services

1:54:16.880 --> 1:54:21.040
 was increasing for most cases, for most periods

1:54:21.040 --> 1:54:22.160
 at a higher rate than that.

1:54:22.160 --> 1:54:24.480
 So you could buy more apples and oranges

1:54:24.480 --> 1:54:27.720
 and houses and cars at the end of the 10 years

1:54:27.720 --> 1:54:29.240
 than you could at the beginning of the 10 years.

1:54:29.240 --> 1:54:31.200
 So everybody had a way of providing for the future.

1:54:31.200 --> 1:54:34.280
 And with that, people lower their time preference.

1:54:34.280 --> 1:54:38.280
 And that is reflected across all aspects of life.

1:54:38.280 --> 1:54:40.080
 I think it's not just the economic thing.

1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:41.480
 You see it in the savings rate,

1:54:41.480 --> 1:54:44.920
 the ability to deny yourself gratification today.

1:54:44.920 --> 1:54:46.400
 I could take the money that I have

1:54:46.400 --> 1:54:50.560
 and throw a giant party, buy a sports car, buy a yacht.

1:54:50.560 --> 1:54:52.960
 And yet you decided, I'm not going to do that.

1:54:52.960 --> 1:54:54.360
 I'm going to keep it so that tomorrow

1:54:54.360 --> 1:54:57.240
 I can throw a bigger party or buy a better yacht

1:54:57.240 --> 1:55:01.280
 or have a better life or give my children a better life.

1:55:01.280 --> 1:55:03.880
 So all of human civilization really

1:55:03.880 --> 1:55:06.680
 is the process of us lowering our time preference

1:55:06.680 --> 1:55:09.120
 and finding harder monies that allow us

1:55:09.120 --> 1:55:10.960
 to provide better for the future

1:55:10.960 --> 1:55:15.200
 is how we really technologically we do that.

1:55:15.200 --> 1:55:17.720
 I think of the hardness of money

1:55:17.720 --> 1:55:20.760
 as being the control knob for our time preference.

1:55:20.760 --> 1:55:23.520
 And you can see this reflected in the 20th century

1:55:23.520 --> 1:55:26.120
 where we go from the money supply increases

1:55:26.120 --> 1:55:28.840
 at around one and a half percent under gold

1:55:28.840 --> 1:55:31.440
 to this current situation where over the last 60 years

1:55:31.440 --> 1:55:34.440
 I ran the numbers on money supply and fiat,

1:55:34.440 --> 1:55:36.360
 the global fiat supply has increased

1:55:36.360 --> 1:55:38.000
 at around 14% per year.

1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:40.280
 So we've done a 10X in the increase

1:55:40.280 --> 1:55:43.000
 in the supply of money annually.

1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:45.280
 And 14% is a weighted average.

1:55:45.280 --> 1:55:48.400
 So if you take a basic numerical average

1:55:48.400 --> 1:55:52.000
 for all fiat currencies, you get something like 30%.

1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:55.000
 The average fiat currency increases by 30%.

1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:57.720
 But if you value it by the volume of each currency

1:55:57.720 --> 1:56:00.160
 so that you're not giving equal weight

1:56:00.160 --> 1:56:04.880
 to the Venezuelan Bolivar increasing at 500% a year

1:56:04.880 --> 1:56:07.000
 and the dollar increasing at 8% a year,

1:56:07.920 --> 1:56:10.480
 if you do it by value of the currencies

1:56:10.480 --> 1:56:12.120
 so that you get the total supply of fiat,

1:56:12.120 --> 1:56:13.720
 it's something like 14%.

1:56:13.720 --> 1:56:15.440
 And weighted is 30% you said?

1:56:15.440 --> 1:56:16.880
 Yeah, 30%.

1:56:16.880 --> 1:56:17.720
 It's insane.

1:56:17.720 --> 1:56:19.040
 I'd like to see the worst ones,

1:56:19.040 --> 1:56:22.320
 the people that are tracking that average up.

1:56:22.320 --> 1:56:23.160
 Yeah.

1:56:23.160 --> 1:56:25.560
 But 14% is still an incredibly high, high number.

1:56:25.560 --> 1:56:27.440
 And so you're saying that,

1:56:27.440 --> 1:56:29.240
 sorry, that's the average over the century

1:56:29.240 --> 1:56:30.080
 or the past 100 years?

1:56:30.080 --> 1:56:32.200
 Over the past 60 years, 1960 to 2020,

1:56:32.200 --> 1:56:34.040
 we get World Bank data on that,

1:56:34.040 --> 1:56:35.640
 pretty reliable data on World Bank

1:56:35.640 --> 1:56:38.640
 and European Union OECD data.

1:56:38.640 --> 1:56:40.680
 I ran the numbers on that weighted average,

1:56:40.680 --> 1:56:42.120
 something like 14%.

1:56:42.120 --> 1:56:45.240
 And what effect that has on time preference?

1:56:45.240 --> 1:56:47.880
 The effect is now it's much, much, much harder

1:56:47.880 --> 1:56:50.080
 for everybody to provide for their future.

1:56:50.080 --> 1:56:52.240
 Everywhere in the world, it's much harder.

1:56:52.240 --> 1:56:56.640
 So how do I get the equivalent of the old gold coin

1:56:56.640 --> 1:56:58.080
 that I could just put under my mattress

1:56:58.080 --> 1:56:59.720
 and expect it to be there 10 years from now?

1:56:59.720 --> 1:57:01.440
 Well, gold itself isn't cutting it.

1:57:01.440 --> 1:57:03.400
 Gold can't keep up with inflation.

1:57:03.400 --> 1:57:06.120
 And the reason for that is that gold is not being used

1:57:06.120 --> 1:57:11.120
 as a money anymore in that you can't send it internationally.

1:57:11.120 --> 1:57:13.120
 Internationally, you can't use it

1:57:13.120 --> 1:57:14.760
 to settle trade internationally,

1:57:14.760 --> 1:57:18.720
 which therefore means demand for it monetarily is limited.

1:57:18.720 --> 1:57:23.400
 And so it's becoming more and more an industrial metal.

1:57:23.400 --> 1:57:26.840
 And as a result of the fact that its value

1:57:26.840 --> 1:57:28.040
 doesn't keep up with inflation,

1:57:28.040 --> 1:57:30.120
 it becomes economical to use it in industry.

1:57:30.120 --> 1:57:32.760
 So we're seeing gold become like silver

1:57:32.760 --> 1:57:34.400
 in that it gets used in industry.

1:57:34.400 --> 1:57:36.280
 So the stockpile declines.

1:57:36.280 --> 1:57:38.720
 And so the stock to flow ratio declines as well,

1:57:38.720 --> 1:57:41.000
 and it becomes more and more of an industrial metal.

1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:44.960
 And it can't protect your wealth over time very well.

1:57:44.960 --> 1:57:45.960
 So what do you do?

1:57:45.960 --> 1:57:47.400
 Well, you could invest.

1:57:47.400 --> 1:57:49.040
 And this is kind of the obvious answer

1:57:49.040 --> 1:57:50.560
 that Keynesian will give you is,

1:57:50.560 --> 1:57:52.960
 well, you just put your money in an investment.

1:57:52.960 --> 1:57:55.120
 But investment is different from saving.

1:57:55.120 --> 1:57:56.560
 Saving, the whole point of saving

1:57:56.560 --> 1:57:57.840
 is that the thing is liquid

1:57:57.840 --> 1:58:00.240
 and that the thing carries little uncertainty.

1:58:00.240 --> 1:58:03.800
 You just held the gold coin and it just sat there.

1:58:03.800 --> 1:58:04.640
 It did nothing.

1:58:04.640 --> 1:58:05.840
 It didn't take risk.

1:58:05.840 --> 1:58:07.680
 You knew that it was gonna be there in 10 years.

1:58:07.680 --> 1:58:10.840
 Investment means you give the gold coin to somebody

1:58:10.840 --> 1:58:13.040
 to go and do something with it.

1:58:13.040 --> 1:58:14.480
 And it could work, it could not work.

1:58:14.480 --> 1:58:16.600
 If it works, you get a positive return.

1:58:16.600 --> 1:58:18.160
 You get more gold back.

1:58:18.160 --> 1:58:21.200
 If it fails, you might not get any of your gold back.

1:58:21.200 --> 1:58:24.480
 So taking on risk is something very different from saving.

1:58:24.480 --> 1:58:27.000
 Saving is just a way of buying the future.

1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:29.480
 Investing is taking on a risk

1:58:29.480 --> 1:58:31.280
 and you could lose everything with it.

1:58:31.280 --> 1:58:33.280
 So what ends up happening,

1:58:33.280 --> 1:58:35.520
 and this is the Keynesian objection I think

1:58:35.520 --> 1:58:39.760
 is very wrong and bad

1:58:39.760 --> 1:58:44.080
 because investment is a job in itself.

1:58:44.080 --> 1:58:46.000
 To figure out what to do with your money

1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:49.160
 in order to beat inflation is something

1:58:49.160 --> 1:58:52.160
 that there are professionals out there on Wall Street

1:58:52.160 --> 1:58:55.680
 that have PhDs in finance, that have enormous computers,

1:58:55.680 --> 1:58:59.600
 and they have enormous staffs of PhDs and master's degrees

1:58:59.600 --> 1:59:01.560
 and math nerds that are crunching numbers

1:59:01.560 --> 1:59:04.200
 and figuring out how to allocate your portfolio

1:59:04.200 --> 1:59:05.600
 so that you can beat inflation.

1:59:05.600 --> 1:59:06.440
 And guess what?

1:59:06.440 --> 1:59:08.560
 The majority of them don't beat inflation.

1:59:08.560 --> 1:59:10.440
 The majority of them can't beat inflation.

1:59:10.440 --> 1:59:13.480
 Not as measured by CPI, which is completely fraudulent,

1:59:13.480 --> 1:59:14.880
 but if you remember.

1:59:14.880 --> 1:59:15.720
 14%.

1:59:15.720 --> 1:59:18.920
 Yeah, that 14% or even the 7%,

1:59:18.920 --> 1:59:21.120
 like if you look at just the increase in the money supply,

1:59:21.120 --> 1:59:23.160
 which I think is a much better metric.

1:59:23.160 --> 1:59:25.440
 And this is what's reflected on the desirable goods.

1:59:25.440 --> 1:59:27.120
 Like if you look at the price of real estate

1:59:27.120 --> 1:59:30.200
 in Miami Beach, as Michael Saylor mentioned in your example,

1:59:30.200 --> 1:59:32.840
 it goes up at around 6, 7% per year on average

1:59:32.840 --> 1:59:34.640
 over the last century.

1:59:34.640 --> 1:59:38.160
 So that's, if you wanna live in a nice area,

1:59:38.160 --> 1:59:39.480
 that's what happening to real estate.

1:59:39.480 --> 1:59:41.000
 If you wanna go to the good universities,

1:59:41.000 --> 1:59:41.840
 that's what's going up.

1:59:41.840 --> 1:59:43.120
 It's going up at a rate that's similar

1:59:43.120 --> 1:59:44.960
 to the increase in the money supply.

1:59:44.960 --> 1:59:47.320
 And you can beat CPI,

1:59:47.320 --> 1:59:50.360
 but CPI is designed so you can beat it,

1:59:50.360 --> 1:59:52.760
 but you can't really beat the appreciation

1:59:52.760 --> 1:59:54.480
 in the things that you actually want to buy,

1:59:54.480 --> 1:59:57.120
 in the price of good food, the price of good real estate.

1:59:57.120 --> 2:00:01.720
 So, and most investment professionals fail at doing that.

2:00:01.720 --> 2:00:06.520
 So what hope does a doctor or an engineer or a scientist

2:00:06.520 --> 2:00:08.800
 or an athlete have in doing those things?

2:00:08.800 --> 2:00:11.760
 And investment is hard and saving should be easy.

2:00:11.760 --> 2:00:12.600
 Exactly.

2:00:12.600 --> 2:00:15.800
 Saving is essential for us as a civilization.

2:00:15.800 --> 2:00:18.920
 And what fiat did is it took that away from us.

2:00:18.920 --> 2:00:22.240
 And then it forced everybody to become an investor

2:00:22.240 --> 2:00:25.720
 or more accurately a gambler, because you're not just even,

2:00:25.720 --> 2:00:27.560
 because the money itself is broken,

2:00:27.560 --> 2:00:30.320
 because the money itself is constantly changing in value,

2:00:30.320 --> 2:00:33.000
 investing is becoming more of a crapshoot.

2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:36.400
 I mean, value investing is completely underperforming,

2:00:36.400 --> 2:00:38.400
 compared to market analysis.

2:00:38.400 --> 2:00:40.480
 You know, you listen to the Fed,

2:00:40.480 --> 2:00:45.480
 and what matters to the price of individual companies

2:00:47.040 --> 2:00:48.480
 is monetary policy much more

2:00:48.480 --> 2:00:50.120
 than it is their own performance.

2:00:50.120 --> 2:00:52.440
 So basically you need to be a junkie watching the Fed

2:00:52.440 --> 2:00:54.040
 and following all of the world's central banks.

2:00:54.040 --> 2:00:55.760
 And yeah, I need to learn macro economics

2:00:55.760 --> 2:00:58.880
 and you need to learn what all the central banks are doing.

2:00:58.880 --> 2:01:00.880
 And you need to understand how commodity markets work.

2:01:00.880 --> 2:01:02.760
 And you need to understand how equity markets work

2:01:02.760 --> 2:01:05.360
 and bond markets and real estate markets.

2:01:05.360 --> 2:01:07.080
 You need to do all of those things

2:01:07.080 --> 2:01:10.400
 just in order to be able to save and earn

2:01:10.400 --> 2:01:13.280
 and keep the money that you've already earned.

2:01:13.280 --> 2:01:14.800
 That's the criminal thing about it.

2:01:14.800 --> 2:01:17.640
 Like I've already earned that money being a doctor,

2:01:17.640 --> 2:01:19.640
 being a dentist, being an athlete, being an engineer.

2:01:19.640 --> 2:01:22.600
 I built a house for somebody and I got that money.

2:01:22.600 --> 2:01:24.240
 And all I wanna do is just make sure

2:01:24.240 --> 2:01:26.800
 that I can have it 10 years from now.

2:01:26.800 --> 2:01:29.280
 The only way to do so is to become a crappy engineer

2:01:29.280 --> 2:01:30.760
 because you have to spend half your time

2:01:30.760 --> 2:01:34.640
 not doing engineering and instead spend half of that time

2:01:34.640 --> 2:01:37.320
 learning about Japanese central bank monetary policy

2:01:37.320 --> 2:01:40.160
 and commodity markets and what's gonna happen to copper

2:01:40.160 --> 2:01:41.720
 and what's gonna happen to oil

2:01:41.720 --> 2:01:44.600
 and what's happening in the wars

2:01:44.600 --> 2:01:46.360
 and what's happening with foreign policy

2:01:46.360 --> 2:01:50.080
 and Russia and the US and all of those things.

2:01:51.360 --> 2:01:52.920
 Under the gold standard,

2:01:52.920 --> 2:01:54.440
 you didn't care about any of that stuff.

2:01:54.440 --> 2:01:56.840
 Your gold coin worked regardless of all of those things.

2:01:56.840 --> 2:01:59.120
 So what this means is the future,

2:01:59.120 --> 2:02:01.400
 so first of all, we have all of the problems I mentioned,

2:02:01.400 --> 2:02:04.760
 but also it means that the future becomes

2:02:04.760 --> 2:02:05.720
 much more uncertain.

2:02:05.720 --> 2:02:08.840
 So you're far less likely to provide for yourself

2:02:08.840 --> 2:02:09.680
 10 years from now,

2:02:09.680 --> 2:02:11.240
 far less likely to find an easy way

2:02:11.240 --> 2:02:14.880
 to give yourself value 10 years from now.

2:02:14.880 --> 2:02:17.120
 And so you become more short termist.

2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:18.560
 And that is reflected economically

2:02:18.560 --> 2:02:22.120
 in a lower savings rate and we see savings rates decline,

2:02:22.120 --> 2:02:25.200
 but it is also reflected in all manners of decision making.

2:02:25.200 --> 2:02:27.600
 And I think if you really wanna see what it is,

2:02:27.600 --> 2:02:30.840
 take a look at a society that goes through hyperinflation

2:02:30.840 --> 2:02:32.560
 and look at what happens there.

2:02:32.560 --> 2:02:36.680
 How do people change under hyperinflation

2:02:36.680 --> 2:02:39.800
 and compare that to essentially what we see

2:02:39.800 --> 2:02:43.440
 in the 20th century all over under not hyperinflation,

2:02:43.440 --> 2:02:45.080
 but under low inflation,

2:02:45.080 --> 2:02:49.600
 10, 15% that you see across the board most of the time

2:02:49.600 --> 2:02:51.840
 is just slow motion hyperinflation.

2:02:51.840 --> 2:02:53.400
 So what happens in hyperinflation?

2:02:53.400 --> 2:02:54.960
 Everybody gets their paychecks,

2:02:54.960 --> 2:02:56.880
 they run straight to the supermarket,

2:02:56.880 --> 2:02:58.520
 they spend all of their money.

2:02:58.520 --> 2:03:00.240
 Nobody thinks about savings.

2:03:00.240 --> 2:03:01.840
 Nobody thinks about the future.

2:03:01.840 --> 2:03:05.960
 Survival until the end of this month is highly uncertain.

2:03:05.960 --> 2:03:07.560
 How likely are you to be planning

2:03:07.560 --> 2:03:10.200
 for what you're going to be doing five years from now?

2:03:11.120 --> 2:03:12.240
 Very unlikely.

2:03:12.240 --> 2:03:15.320
 But also it's reflected not just economically,

2:03:15.320 --> 2:03:17.600
 it's also reflected in all aspects of morality

2:03:17.600 --> 2:03:19.160
 and all the way in which we deal

2:03:19.160 --> 2:03:20.960
 with each other as human beings.

2:03:20.960 --> 2:03:23.560
 When your survival is precarious,

2:03:23.560 --> 2:03:26.280
 how much are you invested in the notion

2:03:26.280 --> 2:03:29.760
 of being a good citizen, on caring about your reputation,

2:03:29.760 --> 2:03:32.800
 on caring about not getting caught in a crime?

2:03:32.800 --> 2:03:35.760
 All of these things become harder to value.

2:03:35.760 --> 2:03:37.160
 So people start committing crime,

2:03:37.160 --> 2:03:39.840
 people start caring less and less about the future.

2:03:39.840 --> 2:03:41.280
 And we see it reflected in everything.

2:03:41.280 --> 2:03:43.920
 And I argue, you see it reflected in architecture.

2:03:43.920 --> 2:03:45.760
 We used to build houses in the 19th century

2:03:45.760 --> 2:03:47.600
 that last until today.

2:03:47.600 --> 2:03:48.720
 And then in the 20th century,

2:03:48.720 --> 2:03:51.680
 we build essentially disposable cardboard boxes

2:03:51.680 --> 2:03:54.400
 that get scrapped in 20 years.

2:03:54.400 --> 2:03:57.720
 So what can you say about potential positive effects

2:03:57.720 --> 2:03:59.080
 of lower time preferences?

2:03:59.080 --> 2:04:00.520
 So I mean, it's a balance.

2:04:00.520 --> 2:04:04.400
 Like basically, you're talking about

2:04:04.400 --> 2:04:05.800
 an average kind of time preference,

2:04:05.800 --> 2:04:07.360
 but there's some things in life

2:04:07.360 --> 2:04:10.600
 where low time preference could be a negative thing.

2:04:10.600 --> 2:04:13.720
 So like if I want to take on risk,

2:04:13.720 --> 2:04:15.920
 not for investment, for a kind of investment,

2:04:15.920 --> 2:04:18.160
 but say I want to start a business,

2:04:18.160 --> 2:04:20.720
 I want to take something crazy,

2:04:20.720 --> 2:04:24.000
 take a leap into the unknown, be an entrepreneur.

2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:26.840
 What can you say about that kind of leap?

2:04:26.840 --> 2:04:28.880
 Taking on debt.

2:04:28.880 --> 2:04:31.840
 What's the value of that within the current system?

2:04:31.840 --> 2:04:32.960
 What's the right approach to that

2:04:32.960 --> 2:04:33.840
 within the current system?

2:04:33.840 --> 2:04:35.360
 What's the right approach overall

2:04:35.360 --> 2:04:37.080
 from an economics perspective?

2:04:37.080 --> 2:04:39.400
 So it's not saving for the future.

2:04:40.240 --> 2:04:43.560
 It's doing something wild,

2:04:43.560 --> 2:04:46.800
 taking the money from your mattress, taking on debt,

2:04:46.800 --> 2:04:48.680
 and having a dream in your heart

2:04:48.680 --> 2:04:50.800
 that you somehow just want to do.

2:04:50.800 --> 2:04:52.960
 Maybe it's not the wisest investment decision,

2:04:52.960 --> 2:04:55.720
 but it's something, you know, it's being human.

2:04:55.720 --> 2:04:58.600
 It's taking a leap into the unknown

2:04:58.600 --> 2:05:00.680
 because something in your heart says to do it.

2:05:00.680 --> 2:05:02.280
 I think you're more likely to be taking the leap

2:05:02.280 --> 2:05:04.400
 in the unknown when you have a little bit of gold

2:05:04.400 --> 2:05:06.320
 in the mattress than when you don't.

2:05:06.320 --> 2:05:07.360
 I think this is the thing.

2:05:07.360 --> 2:05:10.040
 Like if you look at the late 19th century,

2:05:10.040 --> 2:05:11.920
 and I discussed this in the Bitcoin standard,

2:05:11.920 --> 2:05:14.960
 that was arguably the most innovative period

2:05:14.960 --> 2:05:16.280
 in human history.

2:05:16.280 --> 2:05:17.960
 You know, there's qualitative evidence.

2:05:17.960 --> 2:05:20.240
 You know, look at the world around you today.

2:05:20.240 --> 2:05:21.600
 Pretty much everything that we use

2:05:21.600 --> 2:05:23.200
 was invented in that period.

2:05:23.200 --> 2:05:28.200
 The car, the airplane, the telegraph, the telephone,

2:05:30.800 --> 2:05:35.800
 the camera, pretty much modern life as late 19th century.

2:05:35.840 --> 2:05:38.840
 You know, the period between 1870 and 1914,

2:05:38.840 --> 2:05:41.560
 because the whole world was practically on a gold standard,

2:05:41.560 --> 2:05:43.720
 the whole world was using the same money,

2:05:43.720 --> 2:05:46.440
 and the whole world could save in the same currency.

2:05:46.440 --> 2:05:49.000
 That meant that a bicycle shop owner,

2:05:49.000 --> 2:05:52.160
 two bicycle shop owning brothers in North Carolina

2:05:52.160 --> 2:05:53.880
 could go and try and fly,

2:05:53.880 --> 2:05:57.320
 even as all the scientific experts in 1903

2:05:57.320 --> 2:06:01.360
 were confirming that the possibility of flight

2:06:01.360 --> 2:06:03.760
 has been debunked as unscientific.

2:06:03.760 --> 2:06:05.280
 You know, Lord Kelvin said,

2:06:05.280 --> 2:06:07.640
 not in a million years we're going to be flying.

2:06:07.640 --> 2:06:09.520
 Thomas Edison said it's never gonna happen.

2:06:09.520 --> 2:06:11.160
 No, I think it was Edison who said a million years,

2:06:11.160 --> 2:06:14.040
 but Kelvin also said it's never gonna happen.

2:06:14.040 --> 2:06:16.440
 The New York Times said it's never gonna happen

2:06:16.440 --> 2:06:20.000
 the same month in which the Wright brothers did it.

2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:22.400
 And they continued to deny that it was gonna happen

2:06:22.400 --> 2:06:24.160
 even two years after they did it.

2:06:25.240 --> 2:06:27.880
 But that's, why could they do that?

2:06:27.880 --> 2:06:29.480
 Because they had savings in gold.

2:06:29.480 --> 2:06:33.400
 They had the security with something that you know

2:06:33.400 --> 2:06:34.640
 is gonna be there.

2:06:34.640 --> 2:06:37.080
 And then you can take a risk with the stuff that is extra.

2:06:37.080 --> 2:06:40.760
 You know, I have say three years expenditures in gold

2:06:40.760 --> 2:06:42.240
 under my mattress.

2:06:42.240 --> 2:06:45.000
 And I know that I could take a risk with everything else

2:06:45.000 --> 2:06:48.320
 because whatever bad things happen with all of my dreams,

2:06:48.320 --> 2:06:51.640
 like even, you know, flying, think about how insane that is.

2:06:51.640 --> 2:06:54.280
 I still can go back to the three years of gold

2:06:54.280 --> 2:06:55.120
 that I have saved.

2:06:55.120 --> 2:06:57.000
 It's still okay to take on debt

2:06:57.000 --> 2:06:58.760
 given the stuff, the gold under the mattress.

2:06:58.760 --> 2:07:00.920
 Well, this is the thing, under the gold standard,

2:07:00.920 --> 2:07:02.560
 the way that people finance things

2:07:02.560 --> 2:07:04.880
 was predominantly with capital, with equity.

2:07:04.880 --> 2:07:07.360
 So you would, because you had gold savings,

2:07:07.360 --> 2:07:09.720
 I had gold savings, everybody had gold savings.

2:07:09.720 --> 2:07:11.840
 When you wanted to start the business,

2:07:11.840 --> 2:07:14.440
 you could use your own savings or somebody else's savings.

2:07:14.440 --> 2:07:18.040
 So you didn't need to get into debt.

2:07:18.040 --> 2:07:19.960
 Well, you could get equity from others

2:07:19.960 --> 2:07:21.680
 and you could also get debt from others.

2:07:21.680 --> 2:07:22.520
 So there was.

2:07:22.520 --> 2:07:25.440
 But it's directly mapped to physical reality.

2:07:25.440 --> 2:07:27.520
 Yeah, it's directly mapped to economic reality

2:07:27.520 --> 2:07:28.960
 and that there's a hard money out there

2:07:28.960 --> 2:07:31.160
 that, you know, what you're spending money,

2:07:31.160 --> 2:07:34.000
 you know, you wanna build your airplane factory,

2:07:34.000 --> 2:07:35.640
 you need to get actual resources.

2:07:35.640 --> 2:07:38.360
 So you get actual gold, either yours or somebody else's,

2:07:38.360 --> 2:07:40.400
 you borrow it or you give them equity,

2:07:40.400 --> 2:07:42.200
 but there's real resources.

2:07:42.200 --> 2:07:43.680
 Now, what happened with the fiat system?

2:07:43.680 --> 2:07:45.760
 And this is, you know, the first part of the book

2:07:45.760 --> 2:07:48.400
 where I look at it from an engineering kind of perspective

2:07:48.400 --> 2:07:50.840
 is essentially, and I think this is like the breakthrough

2:07:50.840 --> 2:07:53.720
 inside of the book, what fiat does

2:07:53.720 --> 2:07:58.200
 is that it replaces gold mining with credit creation.

2:07:59.480 --> 2:08:01.560
 The way that we make fiat money,

2:08:01.560 --> 2:08:04.080
 the way that fiat is mined into existence

2:08:04.080 --> 2:08:05.200
 is through credit creation.

2:08:05.200 --> 2:08:06.400
 Most people think of fiat money

2:08:06.400 --> 2:08:07.320
 as being something that happens

2:08:07.320 --> 2:08:08.800
 when government prints money.

2:08:08.800 --> 2:08:11.440
 And we still use the term government's printing money,

2:08:11.440 --> 2:08:14.480
 but the vast majority of fiat is not physical.

2:08:14.480 --> 2:08:16.200
 And in fact, fiat is not created

2:08:16.200 --> 2:08:18.080
 when it is printed physically,

2:08:18.080 --> 2:08:19.960
 it's created when it is lent.

2:08:19.960 --> 2:08:22.840
 So when you go to a bank to get a $1 million loan

2:08:22.840 --> 2:08:25.800
 to buy a house, that bank is not gonna give you

2:08:25.800 --> 2:08:27.520
 a million dollars from their own money

2:08:27.520 --> 2:08:29.480
 or from their depositor's money.

2:08:29.480 --> 2:08:32.080
 They're gonna make a fresh new million dollars.

2:08:32.080 --> 2:08:34.320
 When you walk out of that bank,

2:08:34.320 --> 2:08:36.760
 the money supply has increased by $1 million

2:08:36.760 --> 2:08:38.680
 to finance your home.

2:08:38.680 --> 2:08:41.680
 So what fiat does is, I mean,

2:08:41.680 --> 2:08:44.520
 it was basically born out of government credit

2:08:44.520 --> 2:08:46.840
 and the credit of banks that are backed

2:08:46.840 --> 2:08:48.960
 by the central bank and the government.

2:08:48.960 --> 2:08:51.240
 So if you're part of the institutions

2:08:51.240 --> 2:08:53.320
 that are allowed fiat privilege,

2:08:53.320 --> 2:08:56.520
 where you can just issue loans backed by the central bank,

2:08:56.520 --> 2:08:57.960
 backed by the currency,

2:08:57.960 --> 2:09:00.120
 you are effectively creating new currency,

2:09:00.120 --> 2:09:02.360
 new money every time you issue the loan.

2:09:02.360 --> 2:09:05.360
 That's fiat mining is credit creation, I love it.

2:09:05.360 --> 2:09:07.520
 So can you say something, I mean,

2:09:07.520 --> 2:09:10.720
 you can't really have credit without a demand for credit.

2:09:10.720 --> 2:09:12.440
 You can't really have an increase in supply

2:09:12.440 --> 2:09:14.120
 without a demand for it.

2:09:14.120 --> 2:09:18.920
 Is there any value you place in the humans wanting it?

2:09:18.920 --> 2:09:22.720
 Basically, people wanting to do something with that credit,

2:09:22.720 --> 2:09:25.280
 wanting to take big leaps, big risks,

2:09:25.280 --> 2:09:27.840
 big entrepreneurial decisions.

2:09:27.840 --> 2:09:31.240
 So is all credit bad?

2:09:31.240 --> 2:09:36.240
 No, I think what's bad is anything, in my opinion,

2:09:36.400 --> 2:09:38.400
 anything that is consensual,

2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:40.600
 I wanna borrow money from you and we agree the terms,

2:09:40.600 --> 2:09:41.840
 I can't object to that.

2:09:42.880 --> 2:09:46.080
 As long as you and I both agree, I can't object to that.

2:09:46.080 --> 2:09:48.800
 But in the case of the fiat system,

2:09:48.800 --> 2:09:51.960
 it's not just you and the bank who come to an agreement.

2:09:51.960 --> 2:09:53.600
 Everybody who uses the currency

2:09:53.600 --> 2:09:55.800
 is forced to be part of that agreement.

2:09:55.800 --> 2:09:57.640
 Because if you default,

2:09:57.640 --> 2:10:00.400
 effectively what's protecting the bank from you

2:10:00.400 --> 2:10:01.760
 is the fact that the government

2:10:01.760 --> 2:10:04.720
 can just print a bunch of money and make the bank whole.

2:10:04.720 --> 2:10:06.480
 So effectively.

2:10:06.480 --> 2:10:07.320
 Interesting.

2:10:07.320 --> 2:10:11.520
 So that little agreement between the bank and you

2:10:11.520 --> 2:10:14.200
 is actually an agreement between the bank, you,

2:10:14.200 --> 2:10:16.440
 and the entire populace that's using the currency.

2:10:16.440 --> 2:10:17.280
 Exactly.

2:10:17.280 --> 2:10:19.720
 They're forced to provide the safety net for you and me

2:10:19.720 --> 2:10:21.360
 to go and make that loan.

2:10:21.360 --> 2:10:24.040
 And that safety net is the devaluation of the currency.

2:10:24.040 --> 2:10:28.200
 That's how the whole thing actually works.

2:10:28.200 --> 2:10:30.960
 So this is why I wrote the Bitcoin standard,

2:10:30.960 --> 2:10:31.800
 explaining Bitcoin,

2:10:31.800 --> 2:10:34.160
 and basically the takeaway message of the Bitcoin standard

2:10:34.160 --> 2:10:36.600
 is you need to stack as much Bitcoin as you can,

2:10:36.600 --> 2:10:38.720
 because this is the best money that has ever been invented.

2:10:38.720 --> 2:10:39.960
 And we'll talk about that,

2:10:39.960 --> 2:10:42.760
 why Bitcoin is the hardest money.

2:10:42.760 --> 2:10:43.600
 Yeah.

2:10:43.600 --> 2:10:45.600
 But with fiat, the conclusion of the fiat standard,

2:10:45.600 --> 2:10:47.560
 and again, this is not financial advice,

2:10:47.560 --> 2:10:49.760
 I'm a lowly academic,

2:10:49.760 --> 2:10:51.680
 you shouldn't listen to me on issues of money,

2:10:51.680 --> 2:10:54.320
 but I think theoretically and intellectually,

2:10:54.320 --> 2:10:55.640
 the conclusion of the fiat system

2:10:55.640 --> 2:10:58.840
 is you need to be short fiat as much as you can.

2:10:58.840 --> 2:11:00.160
 That's the smart winning move.

2:11:00.160 --> 2:11:04.480
 So human wisdom over thousands of years is to save,

2:11:04.480 --> 2:11:06.160
 try and not borrow as much as you can,

2:11:06.160 --> 2:11:08.440
 try and accumulate as much savings as you can.

2:11:08.440 --> 2:11:09.800
 That's reversed under fiat.

2:11:09.800 --> 2:11:11.680
 If you're saving money,

2:11:11.680 --> 2:11:14.720
 you're just subsidizing everybody else taking on loans.

2:11:14.720 --> 2:11:16.200
 If you're taking on loans,

2:11:16.200 --> 2:11:18.880
 you're benefiting from all the people that are borrowing.

2:11:18.880 --> 2:11:21.000
 So the winning move under the fiat system,

2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:23.720
 and this is what rich people do, is you borrow.

2:11:23.720 --> 2:11:25.560
 Rich people under the fiat monetary system,

2:11:25.560 --> 2:11:27.240
 they don't hold assets.

2:11:28.960 --> 2:11:30.680
 If you're worth a billion dollars today,

2:11:30.680 --> 2:11:33.440
 you don't have a billion dollars in a checking account.

2:11:33.440 --> 2:11:36.240
 You've got maybe a hundred thousand, a million,

2:11:36.240 --> 2:11:39.280
 five million or something like that.

2:11:39.280 --> 2:11:41.720
 A tiny fraction of your money is held in cash.

2:11:41.720 --> 2:11:43.640
 The majority is going to be held

2:11:43.640 --> 2:11:46.160
 in all kinds of other hard assets.

2:11:46.160 --> 2:11:48.120
 And you're gonna be borrowing.

2:11:48.120 --> 2:11:49.640
 The richest people in the world

2:11:49.640 --> 2:11:50.920
 are the biggest borrowers in the world.

2:11:50.920 --> 2:11:52.440
 The most powerful entities in the world,

2:11:52.440 --> 2:11:54.960
 the governments are the biggest borrowers in the world.

2:11:54.960 --> 2:11:57.920
 And that's how they are the richest and the most powerful,

2:11:57.920 --> 2:12:00.120
 because every time you're borrowing,

2:12:00.120 --> 2:12:03.640
 you're giving the bank an excuse to print new money.

2:12:03.640 --> 2:12:05.480
 So you're devaluing everybody else's money

2:12:05.480 --> 2:12:06.880
 and you're getting a bit of the cut.

2:12:06.880 --> 2:12:10.080
 If you were going to buy a house with your savings,

2:12:10.080 --> 2:12:13.040
 you're accumulating the savings and they're losing value.

2:12:13.040 --> 2:12:17.920
 And if I were to go buy the same house with credit,

2:12:17.920 --> 2:12:21.400
 I'm getting the bank to print money for me.

2:12:21.400 --> 2:12:23.680
 So obviously they can cut me in on that deal.

2:12:23.680 --> 2:12:24.960
 And that's why it's much cheaper

2:12:24.960 --> 2:12:26.400
 for everybody to buy with credit.

2:12:26.400 --> 2:12:29.120
 That's why everybody buys everything on credit.

2:12:29.120 --> 2:12:31.400
 So when we look at the global monetary system,

2:12:31.400 --> 2:12:34.280
 the thing you wanna do as a government

2:12:34.280 --> 2:12:37.480
 is be the sexiest currency out there.

2:12:37.480 --> 2:12:42.480
 So the main currency, like the dollar currently is,

2:12:42.720 --> 2:12:46.000
 is the one that has the most power in that kind of context.

2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:49.000
 So you have, if you were to try to summarize

2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:53.040
 what is the global monetary system as it is today,

2:12:53.040 --> 2:12:57.800
 is a bunch of fiat currencies battling for position,

2:12:57.800 --> 2:13:02.800
 for use outside their nation,

2:13:03.160 --> 2:13:05.400
 and in so doing trying to gain power

2:13:05.400 --> 2:13:06.600
 in the geopolitical sense.

2:13:06.600 --> 2:13:08.440
 Is that, if we just zoom out,

2:13:09.400 --> 2:13:11.120
 what is the global monetary system?

2:13:11.120 --> 2:13:14.000
 Like how, what is it currently?

2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:15.960
 So outside of the United States, the whole thing.

2:13:15.960 --> 2:13:18.520
 Yeah, you could say that, but I think it's more realistic

2:13:18.520 --> 2:13:19.960
 looking at how it has actually evolved

2:13:19.960 --> 2:13:21.600
 over the past few decades.

2:13:21.600 --> 2:13:23.200
 It's really a dollar system.

2:13:23.200 --> 2:13:26.440
 It's not a system of currencies buying with one another.

2:13:26.440 --> 2:13:28.400
 It's a dollar system, and all other currencies

2:13:28.400 --> 2:13:30.480
 are just basically, I like to call them dollar

2:13:30.480 --> 2:13:32.040
 plus country risk.

2:13:32.040 --> 2:13:34.240
 So each.

2:13:34.240 --> 2:13:36.400
 It always returns home to the dollar.

2:13:36.400 --> 2:13:37.960
 Yeah, there is no competition.

2:13:37.960 --> 2:13:41.360
 There is no second best, as Michael Saylor would say.

2:13:41.360 --> 2:13:42.640
 And money is like that.

2:13:42.640 --> 2:13:46.520
 Gold was a winner take all by the end of the 19th century.

2:13:46.520 --> 2:13:49.160
 The global monetary market is effectively

2:13:49.160 --> 2:13:51.560
 a winner take all for the dollar.

2:13:51.560 --> 2:13:54.400
 And if we get it to Bitcoin, you'll know,

2:13:54.400 --> 2:13:57.320
 I also think digital currencies are also going to be

2:13:57.320 --> 2:13:59.280
 a winner take all situation.

2:13:59.280 --> 2:14:01.840
 So money wants to be one.

2:14:01.840 --> 2:14:04.120
 In fact, there is no such thing as multiple currencies.

2:14:04.120 --> 2:14:07.280
 Multiple currencies is just a step back to barter.

2:14:07.280 --> 2:14:08.800
 Money is one.

2:14:08.800 --> 2:14:11.080
 If you go back to a system of several currencies,

2:14:11.080 --> 2:14:13.160
 you're just reinventing barter.

2:14:13.160 --> 2:14:16.160
 So in the case of the dollar system,

2:14:16.160 --> 2:14:19.760
 the global dollar system is built around the dollar

2:14:20.720 --> 2:14:23.280
 because all central banks have dollar reserves

2:14:23.280 --> 2:14:24.880
 and because all central banks use

2:14:24.880 --> 2:14:26.680
 the dollar's clearing mechanisms.

2:14:26.680 --> 2:14:30.440
 So that's why you're basically playing in the dollar system.

2:14:30.440 --> 2:14:33.640
 This seems to have changed over the last couple of months

2:14:33.640 --> 2:14:35.560
 with the sanctions on Russia

2:14:35.560 --> 2:14:37.760
 and the confiscation of Russian reserves.

2:14:37.760 --> 2:14:40.840
 It remains to be seen what that's going to do

2:14:40.840 --> 2:14:42.520
 and how that's going to change.

2:14:42.520 --> 2:14:47.280
 But it is looking like this dollar system

2:14:47.280 --> 2:14:48.720
 is clearly unsustainable.

2:14:48.720 --> 2:14:49.920
 It's not sustainable for the US.

2:14:49.920 --> 2:14:51.840
 It's not sustainable for anybody.

2:14:51.840 --> 2:14:56.440
 Speaking of which, so you do an amazing podcast

2:14:56.440 --> 2:14:58.680
 called the Bitcoin Standard Podcast.

2:14:58.680 --> 2:15:01.640
 So episode 108 of that podcast

2:15:01.640 --> 2:15:03.920
 is about the very thing you just mentioned.

2:15:03.920 --> 2:15:06.480
 And allow me please to read the description of that

2:15:06.480 --> 2:15:07.960
 and then ask you a couple questions

2:15:07.960 --> 2:15:09.680
 about your thoughts in general.

2:15:09.680 --> 2:15:11.120
 The description reads,

2:15:11.120 --> 2:15:13.600
 after the Russian invasion of Ukraine,

2:15:13.600 --> 2:15:15.840
 the US confiscated the Russian central bank's

2:15:15.840 --> 2:15:17.640
 significant monetary reserves

2:15:17.640 --> 2:15:20.600
 and banned some Russian banks from the SWIFT network.

2:15:20.600 --> 2:15:22.400
 Serious questions are being asked

2:15:22.400 --> 2:15:25.160
 about the survival of the postwar dollar

2:15:25.160 --> 2:15:28.080
 based world monetary order.

2:15:28.080 --> 2:15:30.080
 Will Russia, China and other countries

2:15:30.080 --> 2:15:33.320
 actually build an alternative international settlement system

2:15:33.320 --> 2:15:35.240
 after years of threatening to do so?

2:15:35.240 --> 2:15:36.360
 Question mark.

2:15:36.360 --> 2:15:38.760
 Will global central banks stop accumulating

2:15:38.760 --> 2:15:40.800
 US treasury bonds and replace them

2:15:40.800 --> 2:15:42.960
 with gold and commodities?

2:15:42.960 --> 2:15:45.240
 Will we witness the birth of a new commodity

2:15:45.240 --> 2:15:47.360
 gold based monetary order?

2:15:47.360 --> 2:15:49.600
 In this seminar, we use the insights

2:15:49.600 --> 2:15:52.200
 from the Bitcoin Standard and the Fiat Standard

2:15:52.200 --> 2:15:54.840
 on temporal and spatial salability

2:15:54.840 --> 2:15:57.640
 to explain why reports of the death of the dollar

2:15:57.640 --> 2:16:00.840
 and the emergence of a new gold standard may be exaggerated.

2:16:00.840 --> 2:16:04.720
 So I would love to get your analysis on this situation.

2:16:04.720 --> 2:16:06.160
 What are the fundamentals of it?

2:16:06.160 --> 2:16:07.280
 What is SWIFT?

2:16:07.280 --> 2:16:09.080
 What are the possible future evolutions

2:16:09.080 --> 2:16:11.280
 of the global monetary system?

2:16:11.280 --> 2:16:12.480
 Yeah, so SWIFT is the network

2:16:12.480 --> 2:16:14.680
 that the US Federal Reserve uses

2:16:14.680 --> 2:16:17.880
 for moving money around the world.

2:16:17.880 --> 2:16:20.080
 So basically the US government can sanction you

2:16:20.080 --> 2:16:22.720
 off of SWIFT as they've done with Russian banks,

2:16:22.720 --> 2:16:24.600
 as they've done with Iran,

2:16:24.600 --> 2:16:27.200
 and as they've done with Afghanistan.

2:16:27.200 --> 2:16:30.960
 So effectively, I mean, this is really the catastrophe

2:16:30.960 --> 2:16:32.080
 of the current monetary system

2:16:32.080 --> 2:16:34.280
 is that in order to be able to trade

2:16:34.280 --> 2:16:37.320
 as a member, as a citizen of your country,

2:16:37.320 --> 2:16:40.360
 you need your monopoly local central bank

2:16:40.360 --> 2:16:42.560
 to be on good terms with the US government

2:16:42.560 --> 2:16:44.080
 so that they would let them operate.

2:16:44.080 --> 2:16:48.320
 And this is really like on top of the aspect

2:16:48.320 --> 2:16:49.480
 of the hardness of money,

2:16:49.480 --> 2:16:52.880
 this is the other really powerful thing about Bitcoin,

2:16:52.880 --> 2:16:54.920
 which is that it's just purely a technological thing.

2:16:54.920 --> 2:16:57.560
 It doesn't matter if you're Russian, if you're Iranian,

2:16:57.560 --> 2:17:00.200
 if you're American, if you're Chinese, it's a technology.

2:17:00.200 --> 2:17:03.560
 And so it's like a spoon or a knife or a car,

2:17:03.560 --> 2:17:06.120
 you operate it properly and it works.

2:17:06.120 --> 2:17:07.520
 And so with Bitcoin, it's the same thing.

2:17:07.520 --> 2:17:09.320
 It doesn't care about your passport.

2:17:09.320 --> 2:17:11.760
 If you have the private key, you click send

2:17:11.760 --> 2:17:14.680
 and the money goes, well, it doesn't really go,

2:17:14.680 --> 2:17:18.040
 but effectively it does go anywhere at once

2:17:18.040 --> 2:17:19.400
 and the money can move

2:17:19.400 --> 2:17:22.440
 without having to abide by political situations.

2:17:22.440 --> 2:17:26.040
 And the point here is not to bash US foreign policy

2:17:26.040 --> 2:17:27.640
 much as that might be deserved.

2:17:27.640 --> 2:17:28.560
 I'm just going to discuss it

2:17:28.560 --> 2:17:31.080
 from a kind of technical perspective.

2:17:31.080 --> 2:17:33.120
 It has to be a political system with fiat

2:17:33.120 --> 2:17:35.240
 because ultimately it relies on credit.

2:17:35.240 --> 2:17:37.480
 And then the government is the one that has the guns

2:17:37.480 --> 2:17:38.760
 and the government is going to decide

2:17:38.760 --> 2:17:40.480
 who gets to pay their loans anyway.

2:17:40.480 --> 2:17:45.480
 And the government's going to have to make its own rules

2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:47.880
 about who gets to play and who doesn't.

2:17:47.880 --> 2:17:51.360
 And so it has to be political as this kind of fiat system.

2:17:52.200 --> 2:17:56.240
 And when I wrote the Bitcoin standard,

2:17:56.240 --> 2:17:58.640
 initially I used to be much more of a gold bug.

2:17:58.640 --> 2:18:02.600
 And in my mind, gold bugs have spent the last 50 years

2:18:02.600 --> 2:18:04.440
 saying the global monetary system

2:18:04.440 --> 2:18:05.600
 is going to collapse next week

2:18:05.600 --> 2:18:07.720
 and we're going to go back to a gold standard.

2:18:07.720 --> 2:18:10.560
 And writing the fiat standard gave me

2:18:10.560 --> 2:18:13.560
 a very good appreciation for why this hasn't happened

2:18:13.560 --> 2:18:15.680
 and why it's not very likely to happen.

2:18:15.680 --> 2:18:18.840
 I think the reason is, as I said earlier,

2:18:18.840 --> 2:18:20.760
 just gold is very expensive to move around

2:18:20.760 --> 2:18:22.440
 and perhaps more importantly,

2:18:22.440 --> 2:18:24.160
 it's very expensive to verify.

2:18:24.160 --> 2:18:25.440
 That's really the problem with it.

2:18:25.440 --> 2:18:27.120
 It's very expensive to verify

2:18:27.120 --> 2:18:29.480
 that the gold that you're receiving is original gold.

2:18:29.480 --> 2:18:32.480
 So the only way to do this properly

2:18:32.480 --> 2:18:35.880
 is to melt the gold bars down and recast them,

2:18:35.880 --> 2:18:37.480
 which is pretty expensive.

2:18:37.480 --> 2:18:40.360
 So we have this situation now where Russia,

2:18:40.360 --> 2:18:42.680
 which is one of the biggest economies in the world

2:18:42.680 --> 2:18:45.640
 has been kicked off to varying degrees

2:18:45.640 --> 2:18:47.320
 off the global monetary system

2:18:47.320 --> 2:18:49.240
 and the US has confiscated their reserves.

2:18:49.240 --> 2:18:52.560
 And I don't have political opinions about the war.

2:18:52.560 --> 2:18:54.360
 It's not something I'm very familiar with.

2:18:54.360 --> 2:18:56.400
 It's outside of my area of expertise.

2:18:56.400 --> 2:18:58.800
 I'm just analyzing the monetary aspects of it.

2:18:58.800 --> 2:19:00.720
 It is, on the one hand,

2:19:00.720 --> 2:19:02.960
 whether you think the war is justified

2:19:02.960 --> 2:19:04.040
 or the sanctions are justified

2:19:04.040 --> 2:19:08.040
 is not something I can opine on.

2:19:08.040 --> 2:19:11.040
 But the implication of this is that effectively

2:19:11.040 --> 2:19:13.000
 the US might be shooting itself in the foot

2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:15.480
 because it's telling everybody in the world,

2:19:15.480 --> 2:19:18.040
 your money in our system is not really your money.

2:19:18.040 --> 2:19:22.120
 It's just a token to play in our arcade.

2:19:22.120 --> 2:19:23.800
 And any point in time, if you misbehave,

2:19:23.800 --> 2:19:27.680
 we kick you out of the arcade and we take your tokens.

2:19:27.680 --> 2:19:32.120
 And so, I mean, this is something that China, Russia, Iran

2:19:32.120 --> 2:19:33.720
 and many countries have made a lot of noise about

2:19:33.720 --> 2:19:35.080
 over the past decades.

2:19:35.080 --> 2:19:38.280
 It got real this year,

2:19:38.280 --> 2:19:43.280
 but it's been decades of China, Iran and Russia

2:19:43.480 --> 2:19:44.800
 to some extent saying that, you know,

2:19:44.800 --> 2:19:48.680
 we wanna build an alternative to the US dollar based system.

2:19:48.680 --> 2:19:50.080
 And yet they haven't.

2:19:50.080 --> 2:19:51.600
 And I think there's very good reasons they haven't.

2:19:51.600 --> 2:19:54.040
 And the reason is, what do you do based on?

2:19:54.040 --> 2:19:55.200
 How do you build it?

2:19:55.200 --> 2:19:57.800
 So you can do a credit based system based on,

2:19:57.800 --> 2:20:00.480
 but then who's gonna be the big boss?

2:20:00.480 --> 2:20:01.400
 Is it gonna be China?

2:20:01.400 --> 2:20:02.240
 Is it gonna be Russia?

2:20:02.240 --> 2:20:03.080
 Is it gonna be Iran?

2:20:03.080 --> 2:20:04.200
 Is it gonna be India?

2:20:04.200 --> 2:20:06.840
 None of these countries wants to be, you know,

2:20:06.840 --> 2:20:10.400
 they don't wanna jump out of the US based system

2:20:10.400 --> 2:20:12.560
 to get into somebody else's based system.

2:20:12.560 --> 2:20:14.440
 So China doesn't wanna use a Russian system.

2:20:14.440 --> 2:20:16.520
 Russia doesn't wanna use a Chinese system.

2:20:16.520 --> 2:20:17.840
 And so therefore you can't use

2:20:17.840 --> 2:20:19.520
 their own central bank's currencies.

2:20:19.520 --> 2:20:23.240
 Don't you think they have enough leverage,

2:20:23.240 --> 2:20:27.800
 India, China, Russia combined with several other nations

2:20:27.800 --> 2:20:29.920
 have enough leverage and incentive

2:20:29.920 --> 2:20:32.040
 to create their own system?

2:20:32.040 --> 2:20:35.600
 So any one player, yes, but if they collaborate.

2:20:35.600 --> 2:20:37.280
 Yeah, but then, okay, so what are you based on?

2:20:37.280 --> 2:20:39.620
 Like who's going to be the boss?

2:20:39.620 --> 2:20:40.880
 Who's going to be the one who can?

2:20:40.880 --> 2:20:42.500
 In this case, China, right?

2:20:44.040 --> 2:20:45.880
 Because China's becoming increasingly

2:20:45.880 --> 2:20:47.640
 an economic power in the world.

2:20:47.640 --> 2:20:48.480
 Yeah.

2:20:48.480 --> 2:20:49.520
 That's hard to deny.

2:20:49.520 --> 2:20:50.360
 Yes, it's true.

2:20:50.360 --> 2:20:52.680
 And it's the most likely scenario perhaps

2:20:52.680 --> 2:20:54.600
 if we were to witness something like this

2:20:54.600 --> 2:20:57.200
 is going to be a Chinese based system.

2:20:57.200 --> 2:21:00.520
 So is it possible to have like a split

2:21:00.520 --> 2:21:04.680
 in what is the driving currency of the world?

2:21:04.680 --> 2:21:06.840
 It's possible, but I don't think it's sustainable.

2:21:06.840 --> 2:21:08.160
 Again, money wants to be won.

2:21:08.160 --> 2:21:10.560
 And that's the kind of thing that I argue in that seminar.

2:21:10.560 --> 2:21:13.480
 So we could see this emerge based around the Yuan

2:21:13.480 --> 2:21:18.200
 and likely, I mean, Russia is obviously going to hurt

2:21:18.200 --> 2:21:19.600
 economically from what happened

2:21:19.600 --> 2:21:22.160
 from the confiscation of the reserves and from the sanctions.

2:21:22.160 --> 2:21:24.600
 So it's not going to be in a position.

2:21:24.600 --> 2:21:27.680
 And of course, because it's outside of the US based system,

2:21:27.680 --> 2:21:29.760
 it's not in the strongest negotiating position

2:21:29.760 --> 2:21:30.600
 with the Chinese.

2:21:30.600 --> 2:21:32.720
 So the Chinese might be able to get them

2:21:32.720 --> 2:21:34.960
 to join their Yuan based system.

2:21:34.960 --> 2:21:36.920
 But I don't think that's sustainable in the long run

2:21:36.920 --> 2:21:41.120
 because these governments can issue their laws

2:21:41.120 --> 2:21:45.080
 and make their designs and then make their monetary systems.

2:21:45.080 --> 2:21:50.080
 But ultimately, there are billions of Chinese people

2:21:50.280 --> 2:21:52.040
 and billions of dollar based people

2:21:52.040 --> 2:21:53.680
 and they're going to want to trade with one another.

2:21:53.680 --> 2:21:55.560
 And the power to want to trade with one another

2:21:55.560 --> 2:21:56.400
 is too strong.

2:21:56.400 --> 2:21:58.200
 We can't just split the world economy

2:21:58.200 --> 2:22:00.720
 into two monetary systems that don't trade with one another.

2:22:00.720 --> 2:22:02.920
 So then they're going to want to trade with one another.

2:22:02.920 --> 2:22:07.920
 Or the dark possibility is the inability to trade

2:22:10.840 --> 2:22:14.400
 as opposed to being a forcing function for trade.

2:22:14.400 --> 2:22:17.720
 It will become a forcing function for conflict

2:22:17.720 --> 2:22:20.280
 in cyberspace and potentially hot war.

2:22:20.280 --> 2:22:22.560
 Yes, this is the scary part of it.

2:22:22.560 --> 2:22:24.800
 And this is basically how World War II happened

2:22:24.800 --> 2:22:28.280
 because there's an old historian who used to say

2:22:28.280 --> 2:22:30.400
 when I think his name is Otto Mallory

2:22:30.400 --> 2:22:31.960
 and I quote him in the Bitcoin standard,

2:22:31.960 --> 2:22:35.600
 if goods don't cross borders, then bombs will.

2:22:35.600 --> 2:22:36.760
 If people trade with one another,

2:22:36.760 --> 2:22:39.280
 they have an incentive for each other's wellbeing

2:22:39.280 --> 2:22:42.520
 and then they have less of an incentive to fight.

2:22:42.520 --> 2:22:45.520
 And it was the death of global trade in the 1930s

2:22:45.520 --> 2:22:48.680
 because of the failure of the fiat system

2:22:48.680 --> 2:22:52.040
 that brought about the rise of the populism

2:22:52.040 --> 2:22:54.120
 and the rise of all those leaders that hated each other

2:22:54.120 --> 2:22:56.240
 and helped finance the war and bring it about.

2:22:56.240 --> 2:22:58.120
 So that is the scary possibility.

2:22:59.000 --> 2:23:00.920
 And of course, you can't discount that

2:23:00.920 --> 2:23:02.560
 with all of the escalation that you see,

2:23:02.560 --> 2:23:05.520
 that is a possibility that it could turn into a real war.

2:23:05.520 --> 2:23:09.120
 But then even so, I think ultimately,

2:23:09.120 --> 2:23:10.680
 you can't fight wars forever.

2:23:12.240 --> 2:23:13.880
 It's going to end at some point.

2:23:13.880 --> 2:23:15.640
 And we're going to be back at square one

2:23:15.640 --> 2:23:16.920
 or well, not square one.

2:23:16.920 --> 2:23:18.240
 We're going to be back at the same dilemma

2:23:18.240 --> 2:23:21.800
 of who's going to have the global monetary system.

2:23:21.800 --> 2:23:24.560
 And so one alternative is that what the Chinese

2:23:24.560 --> 2:23:27.040
 and the Russians could do is they could base it

2:23:27.040 --> 2:23:28.240
 on a commodity.

2:23:28.240 --> 2:23:29.320
 So a lot of people are now saying,

2:23:29.320 --> 2:23:32.640
 well, they're going to base it on copper and corn

2:23:32.640 --> 2:23:35.480
 and agricultural commodities.

2:23:35.480 --> 2:23:38.160
 And that's the analysis of saleability

2:23:38.160 --> 2:23:39.680
 that we discuss in the Bitcoin standard

2:23:39.680 --> 2:23:40.880
 and the fiat standard.

2:23:40.880 --> 2:23:42.200
 I don't think that's workable.

2:23:42.200 --> 2:23:44.760
 If you end up basing the monetary system on copper,

2:23:44.760 --> 2:23:47.240
 as we said earlier, it doesn't matter how many governments

2:23:47.240 --> 2:23:50.120
 say that we're going to make a new monetary system

2:23:50.120 --> 2:23:55.120
 based on copper grains and nickel and iron and so on.

2:23:56.440 --> 2:23:57.280
 It doesn't matter.

2:23:57.280 --> 2:24:00.000
 You're going to have to stockpile those things

2:24:00.000 --> 2:24:02.400
 in order to make a market in them.

2:24:02.400 --> 2:24:03.720
 And then if you stockpile those things,

2:24:03.720 --> 2:24:05.440
 you're just raising their value,

2:24:05.440 --> 2:24:08.800
 inviting the producers to make more, flood the market.

2:24:08.800 --> 2:24:10.600
 I hope they don't try this because it's going to be

2:24:10.600 --> 2:24:15.240
 a devastating, devastating impact on the world economy.

2:24:15.240 --> 2:24:17.960
 You're going to have central banks bidding up the price

2:24:17.960 --> 2:24:20.800
 of essential commodities that people need for real uses

2:24:20.800 --> 2:24:23.000
 in order to back their currencies with them,

2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:24.800
 and then just incentivizing the producers

2:24:24.800 --> 2:24:26.600
 to make more and more and more of it,

2:24:26.600 --> 2:24:28.040
 and then bringing the price back down.

2:24:28.040 --> 2:24:29.840
 So it's going to be a very expensive mistake

2:24:29.840 --> 2:24:31.640
 where we raise the price of copper,

2:24:31.640 --> 2:24:33.840
 destroy a lot of industries dependent on copper,

2:24:33.840 --> 2:24:35.600
 and it's not just copper, but also food,

2:24:35.600 --> 2:24:38.240
 and then increase the supply beyond what we need.

2:24:38.240 --> 2:24:41.680
 And the end result is copper miners make out well,

2:24:41.680 --> 2:24:43.720
 governments go broke,

2:24:43.720 --> 2:24:46.240
 and we end up with a lot of rust in copper

2:24:46.240 --> 2:24:49.520
 in government warehouses.

2:24:49.520 --> 2:24:54.120
 That's why I don't think it works to use commodities

2:24:54.120 --> 2:24:56.360
 that are not monetary commodities.

2:24:56.360 --> 2:24:58.520
 Then the question is maybe gold.

2:24:58.520 --> 2:25:00.800
 Can we go back on another gold standard?

2:25:00.800 --> 2:25:04.520
 And I mean, Russia seems to have done that.

2:25:04.520 --> 2:25:05.600
 I'm not so sure.

2:25:05.600 --> 2:25:07.640
 It's very difficult to get reliable information.

2:25:07.640 --> 2:25:09.320
 I'm trying to look into this more,

2:25:10.280 --> 2:25:13.160
 but they seem to have said that they're fixing

2:25:13.160 --> 2:25:15.200
 the price of gold in rubles.

2:25:15.200 --> 2:25:18.640
 So they will buy and sell gold at a fixed ruble rate,

2:25:18.640 --> 2:25:20.920
 which effectively means you're on a gold standard.

2:25:20.920 --> 2:25:24.640
 Now, I'm not sure how much, how serious this is,

2:25:24.640 --> 2:25:26.440
 how they've managed to stick to it,

2:25:26.440 --> 2:25:28.840
 but it seems to have stabilized the ruble

2:25:28.840 --> 2:25:31.000
 and in fact brought it back to its pre war level,

2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:33.320
 which I found absolutely astonishing,

2:25:33.320 --> 2:25:35.920
 considering all the sanctions going on.

2:25:35.920 --> 2:25:39.720
 But in the short run, it's obviously much better

2:25:39.720 --> 2:25:41.720
 than having your currency pegged to nothing.

2:25:41.720 --> 2:25:43.200
 But in the long run,

2:25:43.200 --> 2:25:45.520
 I also don't think gold is gonna cut it

2:25:45.520 --> 2:25:46.720
 in the 21st century.

2:25:46.720 --> 2:25:50.600
 Do you think there's any chance they go full gangster move

2:25:50.600 --> 2:25:54.720
 and go into the digital space on the blockchain

2:25:54.720 --> 2:25:55.800
 and go with Bitcoin?

2:25:56.880 --> 2:25:59.640
 I think the point of this discussion is that,

2:25:59.640 --> 2:26:01.760
 we run through all these other options,

2:26:01.760 --> 2:26:04.600
 a Chinese based system, why it probably won't work,

2:26:04.600 --> 2:26:06.400
 a commodity based system, why it won't work,

2:26:06.400 --> 2:26:08.720
 and a gold based system, why it won't work.

2:26:08.720 --> 2:26:12.040
 I think they might have to learn this the wrong way.

2:26:12.040 --> 2:26:13.560
 I mean, the hard way.

2:26:13.560 --> 2:26:16.000
 But eventually, I don't see them doing it now,

2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:18.720
 but eventually I think the winning move

2:26:18.720 --> 2:26:21.480
 is going to be to go on a Bitcoin based monetary system.

2:26:21.480 --> 2:26:23.880
 Well, I don't know if everything always has to be

2:26:23.880 --> 2:26:25.720
 the hard way.

2:26:25.720 --> 2:26:27.600
 I'd love it not to be, but I mean,

2:26:28.640 --> 2:26:31.960
 it doesn't look like there is any kind of desire

2:26:31.960 --> 2:26:34.720
 in China or in Russia to switch to a Bitcoin based system.

2:26:34.720 --> 2:26:36.120
 To take a leap to Bitcoin.

2:26:36.120 --> 2:26:39.680
 So unfortunately, I think we're gonna go through

2:26:39.680 --> 2:26:44.200
 a few years, maybe many years of learning the lesson

2:26:44.200 --> 2:26:46.800
 the hard way, of trying to accumulate these commodities

2:26:46.800 --> 2:26:49.200
 and seeing the limitations that make them unsuitable

2:26:49.200 --> 2:26:50.440
 as money today.

2:26:50.440 --> 2:26:52.280
 One of the things I'm really concerned about

2:26:52.280 --> 2:26:53.880
 is the tension, the amount,

2:26:55.960 --> 2:26:58.000
 the increasing amount of hate in the world.

2:26:58.000 --> 2:26:58.880
 Yes.

2:26:58.880 --> 2:27:03.480
 And the increasing amount of power centers in the world

2:27:03.480 --> 2:27:08.480
 between which hate is making a regular appearance.

2:27:12.040 --> 2:27:14.440
 And because the weapons of war are becoming

2:27:14.440 --> 2:27:16.000
 more and more powerful as they have been

2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:19.640
 in the past many decades,

2:27:19.640 --> 2:27:22.280
 I'm really concerned about nuclear war.

2:27:22.280 --> 2:27:25.160
 So let us see if Bitcoin can fix this.

2:27:25.160 --> 2:27:27.280
 Yes, Bitcoin fixes all of this.

2:27:27.280 --> 2:27:31.040
 The first rule of Bitcoin is if it's a problem,

2:27:31.040 --> 2:27:32.040
 Bitcoin fixes it.

2:27:32.040 --> 2:27:35.080
 All right, well I have some personal questions

2:27:35.080 --> 2:27:37.120
 for Bitcoin then, because I have some,

2:27:37.120 --> 2:27:40.040
 my life is pretty fucked up, so I'll have to try to see.

2:27:40.040 --> 2:27:41.680
 A quick pause for bathroom breaking, any?

2:27:41.680 --> 2:27:43.120
 Sure.

2:27:43.120 --> 2:27:44.800
 Let's return to the basics.

2:27:44.800 --> 2:27:46.400
 What is Bitcoin?

2:27:46.400 --> 2:27:49.320
 We started with what is money, what is Bitcoin?

2:27:49.320 --> 2:27:52.400
 We talked about hard money, inflation,

2:27:52.400 --> 2:27:56.800
 fiat, the history of money, the history of war

2:27:56.800 --> 2:27:58.640
 in the 20th century, and that takes us

2:27:58.640 --> 2:28:00.320
 into the 21st century.

2:28:00.320 --> 2:28:02.120
 What is Bitcoin?

2:28:02.120 --> 2:28:05.800
 Bitcoin is a software, and it's a distributed software

2:28:05.800 --> 2:28:09.080
 to operate peer to peer network between members

2:28:09.080 --> 2:28:11.800
 who are all equal on the network, they're all peers.

2:28:11.800 --> 2:28:14.520
 And what this software does is that it allows you

2:28:14.520 --> 2:28:19.400
 to operate a payment network between those peers,

2:28:19.400 --> 2:28:22.360
 and that payment network has its own currency.

2:28:22.360 --> 2:28:26.320
 And that seems like just a simple software game,

2:28:26.320 --> 2:28:28.680
 but the reason this is such a big deal is,

2:28:28.680 --> 2:28:30.760
 I believe Bitcoin is the most advanced form

2:28:30.760 --> 2:28:32.440
 of money ever invented.

2:28:32.440 --> 2:28:34.880
 And the reason for that comes from two properties

2:28:34.880 --> 2:28:36.840
 that this network has.

2:28:36.840 --> 2:28:39.320
 The first one is that the currency

2:28:39.320 --> 2:28:41.720
 is the hardest money ever invented.

2:28:41.720 --> 2:28:44.800
 It's the money whose supply is the most resistant

2:28:44.800 --> 2:28:45.960
 to inflation.

2:28:45.960 --> 2:28:49.040
 It's the first monetary asset that we've ever invented

2:28:49.040 --> 2:28:52.120
 that is guaranteed to be fixed in its supply,

2:28:52.120 --> 2:28:54.600
 that cannot be increased beyond a certain number.

2:28:54.600 --> 2:28:56.960
 So there's only ever going to be 21 million Bitcoins.

2:28:56.960 --> 2:29:00.600
 And that's a qualitative leap forward

2:29:00.600 --> 2:29:02.640
 in our technologies of money.

2:29:02.640 --> 2:29:05.560
 All of our monies leak, essentially,

2:29:05.560 --> 2:29:08.400
 because people can always make more and more and more of them.

2:29:08.400 --> 2:29:11.040
 You know, the best money is the one that leaks the least,

2:29:11.040 --> 2:29:13.800
 which is gold, because it only leaks one and a half percent.

2:29:13.800 --> 2:29:17.840
 In other words, your share of the gold stock

2:29:17.840 --> 2:29:21.200
 is diluted by one and a half percent every year.

2:29:21.200 --> 2:29:23.240
 Ideally, you'd like it to be zero.

2:29:23.240 --> 2:29:27.480
 Bitcoin is currently at around 1.8% headed towards zero.

2:29:27.480 --> 2:29:29.200
 So it's the first money that we've ever had

2:29:29.200 --> 2:29:31.960
 that goes to zero in terms of terminal supply.

2:29:31.960 --> 2:29:34.640
 So there'll never be more than 21 million Bitcoin.

2:29:34.640 --> 2:29:36.880
 I think that's a huge deal because, you know,

2:29:36.880 --> 2:29:39.560
 as I said earlier, money is always whatever

2:29:39.560 --> 2:29:40.480
 is the hardest to make,

2:29:40.480 --> 2:29:43.240
 and now Bitcoin is the hardest thing to make.

2:29:43.240 --> 2:29:44.520
 And then the second property,

2:29:44.520 --> 2:29:46.800
 which is extremely important as well,

2:29:46.800 --> 2:29:50.200
 is the fact that it operates without the need

2:29:50.200 --> 2:29:51.560
 to trust in anybody.

2:29:51.560 --> 2:29:54.040
 It doesn't have a party that is in charge of it.

2:29:54.040 --> 2:29:57.080
 It doesn't have a central authority that can,

2:29:57.080 --> 2:29:58.720
 you know, as I said, it's peer to peer.

2:29:58.720 --> 2:30:00.560
 So it only has users.

2:30:00.560 --> 2:30:02.440
 It doesn't have any admins.

2:30:02.440 --> 2:30:04.720
 There's no authority in charge of Bitcoin

2:30:04.720 --> 2:30:05.840
 that can take your Bitcoin,

2:30:05.840 --> 2:30:08.200
 that can stop you from using Bitcoin,

2:30:08.200 --> 2:30:09.600
 that can change the rules of Bitcoin.

2:30:09.600 --> 2:30:11.080
 They can't make more of it.

2:30:11.080 --> 2:30:12.800
 So it's fixed.

2:30:12.800 --> 2:30:15.160
 It's available for anybody in the world.

2:30:15.160 --> 2:30:17.200
 It's the hardest money ever invented.

2:30:17.200 --> 2:30:21.920
 And it is absolutely, I think, an enormously,

2:30:21.920 --> 2:30:23.520
 enormously significant invention

2:30:23.520 --> 2:30:26.440
 because if you read the fiat standard

2:30:26.440 --> 2:30:28.600
 and the Bitcoin standard as well,

2:30:28.600 --> 2:30:31.200
 you'll see my perspective for why I think

2:30:31.200 --> 2:30:34.520
 a very large number of problems in the world

2:30:34.520 --> 2:30:37.320
 are caused by easy money, are caused by inflation,

2:30:38.320 --> 2:30:41.840
 and caused by government having access to essentially

2:30:41.840 --> 2:30:45.880
 an infinite recourse to people's wealth.

2:30:45.880 --> 2:30:47.840
 And I think Bitcoin fixes this

2:30:47.840 --> 2:30:51.440
 because it allows us to have money

2:30:51.440 --> 2:30:54.440
 that has the salability of gold across time,

2:30:54.440 --> 2:30:57.280
 meaning it holds its value across time like gold,

2:30:57.280 --> 2:30:58.720
 but much better than gold.

2:30:58.720 --> 2:31:01.800
 But also it is similar to fiat

2:31:01.800 --> 2:31:03.840
 in that fiat can travel quickly,

2:31:03.840 --> 2:31:06.080
 but Bitcoin can travel even faster than fiat.

2:31:06.080 --> 2:31:11.080
 So it combines gold's salability across time

2:31:11.400 --> 2:31:14.000
 with fiat's salability across space

2:31:14.000 --> 2:31:17.200
 in one immutable package that nobody can change

2:31:17.200 --> 2:31:18.280
 and nobody can control.

2:31:18.280 --> 2:31:20.120
 Can you define the word salability?

2:31:20.120 --> 2:31:22.960
 Salability is the essential property of money.

2:31:22.960 --> 2:31:27.960
 It's the ability of a good to be sold easily on the market,

2:31:28.520 --> 2:31:31.200
 specifically to be sold without much loss in its value.

2:31:31.200 --> 2:31:33.560
 So houses are great for living in,

2:31:33.560 --> 2:31:35.040
 but they're not very salable.

2:31:35.040 --> 2:31:36.680
 If you wanna sell a house,

2:31:36.680 --> 2:31:38.600
 you can just click a button and sell a house

2:31:38.600 --> 2:31:41.880
 and have a giant market of people buying houses from you.

2:31:41.880 --> 2:31:45.000
 You need to find somebody

2:31:45.000 --> 2:31:46.720
 who wants the exact house that you have

2:31:46.720 --> 2:31:48.800
 with the exact specifications that you have.

2:31:48.800 --> 2:31:50.480
 And because houses are not identical,

2:31:50.480 --> 2:31:52.160
 there's no liquid giant market

2:31:52.160 --> 2:31:55.360
 for people to just buy and sell identical houses from.

2:31:56.400 --> 2:32:01.400
 So gold, for instance, has good salability as money

2:32:01.640 --> 2:32:03.880
 because it's a liquid good, it's uniform,

2:32:03.880 --> 2:32:06.040
 and people are always buying it.

2:32:06.040 --> 2:32:08.200
 Fiat dollars have great salability

2:32:08.200 --> 2:32:09.880
 because everybody's always buying

2:32:09.880 --> 2:32:11.960
 and exchanging dollars for other goods.

2:32:11.960 --> 2:32:15.320
 So if you have $100 bill, you can easily get rid of it

2:32:15.320 --> 2:32:18.000
 and you'll get $100 worth of stuff for it.

2:32:18.000 --> 2:32:20.880
 If you have $100 worth of stuff,

2:32:20.880 --> 2:32:22.000
 it's harder to get rid of it.

2:32:22.000 --> 2:32:24.600
 If you have $100 worth of phone,

2:32:24.600 --> 2:32:26.960
 it's not as easy to spend it as a $100 bill.

2:32:26.960 --> 2:32:28.400
 That's salability.

2:32:28.400 --> 2:32:31.000
 What do you mean that Bitcoin,

2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:33.280
 I understand that Bitcoin has the salability

2:32:33.280 --> 2:32:35.280
 of gold across time.

2:32:35.280 --> 2:32:36.360
 Better even, yeah.

2:32:36.360 --> 2:32:39.360
 Better, yes, like on the order or whatever.

2:32:39.360 --> 2:32:42.880
 And then it has the salability of fiat across space.

2:32:42.880 --> 2:32:43.800
 What does that mean?

2:32:43.800 --> 2:32:44.760
 So if you remember when you asked me

2:32:44.760 --> 2:32:46.200
 what is the advantage of fiat,

2:32:46.200 --> 2:32:48.160
 what is the advantage it offers us,

2:32:48.160 --> 2:32:50.880
 it's cheaper to move fiat across space

2:32:50.880 --> 2:32:52.400
 than it is to move gold.

2:32:52.400 --> 2:32:54.800
 With the current fiat monetary system,

2:32:54.800 --> 2:32:58.360
 for all of its flaws, you can send money,

2:32:58.360 --> 2:33:01.240
 I could send money from my bank account in the US

2:33:01.240 --> 2:33:05.280
 to a bank account in China in a couple of days,

2:33:05.280 --> 2:33:08.920
 or in Britain, in France, in a day or two,

2:33:08.920 --> 2:33:10.960
 which is much faster than you could do with gold

2:33:10.960 --> 2:33:13.440
 and much cheaper than you could do with gold.

2:33:13.440 --> 2:33:16.400
 But in reality, with fiat,

2:33:16.400 --> 2:33:17.800
 the reason Bitcoin improves on that

2:33:17.800 --> 2:33:19.560
 is that with Bitcoin, you're actually selling,

2:33:19.560 --> 2:33:23.000
 you're sending final settlement in a couple of hours.

2:33:23.000 --> 2:33:24.360
 So you send the Bitcoin transaction,

2:33:24.360 --> 2:33:26.480
 you get six confirmations in an hour,

2:33:26.480 --> 2:33:29.800
 you get about 12 confirmations in two hours on average.

2:33:29.800 --> 2:33:34.320
 With 12 confirmations, you're pretty definitely

2:33:34.320 --> 2:33:36.560
 clearly safe on this.

2:33:36.560 --> 2:33:38.360
 So within a couple of hours,

2:33:38.360 --> 2:33:41.080
 you could send a billion dollars across the ocean

2:33:41.080 --> 2:33:44.040
 and have final settlement on them.

2:33:44.040 --> 2:33:46.600
 It's not just that you've sent a credit obligation

2:33:46.600 --> 2:33:49.080
 that's gonna need weeks and months to settle,

2:33:49.080 --> 2:33:51.040
 which is the case with fiat.

2:33:51.040 --> 2:33:54.040
 So it is faster than fiat, effectively.

2:33:54.040 --> 2:33:56.960
 So it's harder than gold and faster than fiat.

2:33:56.960 --> 2:33:58.560
 That's a good way of putting it.

2:34:00.240 --> 2:34:04.040
 One other aspect of Bitcoin I have to ask,

2:34:04.040 --> 2:34:06.680
 to me on a human level, it's fascinating,

2:34:06.680 --> 2:34:09.760
 is it was founded by Satoshi Nakamoto,

2:34:09.760 --> 2:34:12.000
 an anonymous founder, there's no leader.

2:34:12.000 --> 2:34:14.960
 So that's another aspect of the decentralization

2:34:14.960 --> 2:34:16.280
 is leaderless.

2:34:16.280 --> 2:34:17.160
 Yeah.

2:34:17.160 --> 2:34:19.560
 So unfortunately, it's not a monarchy.

2:34:19.560 --> 2:34:20.400
 Fortunately.

2:34:20.400 --> 2:34:22.160
 Or fortunately, yes.

2:34:22.160 --> 2:34:24.560
 Who is Satoshi Nakamoto, do you think?

2:34:24.560 --> 2:34:26.680
 And first of all, is it you?

2:34:26.680 --> 2:34:28.200
 It definitely is not me.

2:34:29.400 --> 2:34:30.440
 I don't know who it is.

2:34:30.440 --> 2:34:32.040
 If it was, would you tell me?

2:34:32.040 --> 2:34:34.360
 That's a trick question.

2:34:34.360 --> 2:34:35.560
 Yeah, I know, trick question.

2:34:35.560 --> 2:34:37.040
 But I mean, everybody who knows me knows

2:34:37.040 --> 2:34:38.040
 I can't read the code.

2:34:38.040 --> 2:34:41.120
 So you would say that even if you could.

2:34:42.440 --> 2:34:43.320
 But that's true.

2:34:43.320 --> 2:34:44.440
 Do you think it's one person?

2:34:44.440 --> 2:34:45.640
 Do you think it's multiple people?

2:34:45.640 --> 2:34:47.000
 Is it interesting to you?

2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:49.520
 Do you think it's fundamental to the coin itself

2:34:49.520 --> 2:34:53.200
 to not to coin the entirety of the concept

2:34:54.120 --> 2:34:56.240
 that it's founders and animus?

2:34:56.240 --> 2:34:58.640
 And how much guts do you think it takes

2:34:58.640 --> 2:35:02.320
 if it's one person to just walk away from so much money?

2:35:02.320 --> 2:35:04.720
 I've considered all these questions many times.

2:35:04.720 --> 2:35:07.720
 It's very hard to formulate a definitive answer

2:35:07.720 --> 2:35:09.160
 to all of them.

2:35:09.160 --> 2:35:10.120
 I don't know who it is.

2:35:10.120 --> 2:35:15.120
 And I don't know why he or them or she

2:35:15.640 --> 2:35:19.960
 are not spending the coins that they most likely have.

2:35:19.960 --> 2:35:23.040
 I think what really matters in Bitcoin about Satoshi

2:35:23.040 --> 2:35:24.920
 is the fact that he's not there.

2:35:24.920 --> 2:35:28.040
 And this is what's truly astonishing about it.

2:35:28.040 --> 2:35:29.720
 The most important fact in Bitcoin

2:35:29.720 --> 2:35:31.800
 is the fact that the creators disappeared

2:35:31.800 --> 2:35:33.440
 and the thing has continued to operate now

2:35:33.440 --> 2:35:35.560
 for almost 12 years without him being there

2:35:35.560 --> 2:35:38.880
 or 11 years I think it's been since he's left.

2:35:38.880 --> 2:35:41.120
 And this is really the most important thing.

2:35:41.120 --> 2:35:44.520
 And maybe he died or she died

2:35:44.520 --> 2:35:49.440
 or they got into an accident on a road trip or whatever

2:35:49.440 --> 2:35:51.240
 and that's why they haven't accessed their coins.

2:35:51.240 --> 2:35:54.040
 Maybe they're incapacitated for some reason.

2:35:54.040 --> 2:35:55.960
 But whatever reason it is,

2:35:55.960 --> 2:36:00.560
 I really think it's fate or serendipity

2:36:00.560 --> 2:36:04.520
 that has given us this very vital,

2:36:04.520 --> 2:36:07.960
 very, very, very vital building ingredient in Bitcoin

2:36:07.960 --> 2:36:11.120
 which no other digital currency would ever recreate,

2:36:11.120 --> 2:36:14.760
 which is that because it was the first,

2:36:14.760 --> 2:36:17.360
 it was the one that was able to establish

2:36:17.360 --> 2:36:19.520
 the first mover advantage and get all of the people

2:36:19.520 --> 2:36:22.160
 who are interested in the technology to get into it.

2:36:22.160 --> 2:36:23.760
 And so that's an enormous advantage,

2:36:23.760 --> 2:36:28.760
 but the cherry on top or what made the whole thing

2:36:28.760 --> 2:36:31.800
 really function well is the fact

2:36:31.800 --> 2:36:33.760
 that the guy who made it disappeared

2:36:33.760 --> 2:36:35.280
 and that it continued to operate,

2:36:35.280 --> 2:36:37.440
 which is just a clear illustration

2:36:37.440 --> 2:36:39.760
 that this is a network with no admins.

2:36:39.760 --> 2:36:42.400
 And I'm tempted to think that they're incapacitated

2:36:42.400 --> 2:36:44.160
 in some way, probably dead or gone

2:36:44.160 --> 2:36:48.200
 because I can't believe the,

2:36:48.200 --> 2:36:50.040
 I don't believe any human being

2:36:50.040 --> 2:36:52.240
 would have this level of self control

2:36:52.240 --> 2:36:55.520
 to not get into, not want to meddle

2:36:55.520 --> 2:37:00.520
 with their invention so much, even if they,

2:37:00.760 --> 2:37:01.920
 they might have had the self control

2:37:01.920 --> 2:37:03.480
 to like mine the first million coins

2:37:03.480 --> 2:37:05.880
 to get the network going and then throw away the coins

2:37:05.880 --> 2:37:07.040
 or send them to an address

2:37:07.040 --> 2:37:08.640
 that they don't have the key to

2:37:10.160 --> 2:37:12.160
 because they really just wanted the network to take off.

2:37:12.160 --> 2:37:14.200
 They may have no access to the coins

2:37:14.200 --> 2:37:15.480
 and that's why they can't move them.

2:37:15.480 --> 2:37:17.000
 I could see that happening,

2:37:17.000 --> 2:37:18.240
 but I find it harder to believe

2:37:18.240 --> 2:37:20.320
 that they would resist the temptation

2:37:20.320 --> 2:37:21.880
 to mess with the network.

2:37:21.880 --> 2:37:25.320
 You know, it's funny, I find that the founders of ideas

2:37:25.320 --> 2:37:29.600
 are often principled and have the integrity

2:37:29.600 --> 2:37:34.600
 that the eventual users of those ideas don't fully have.

2:37:35.600 --> 2:37:38.480
 I tend to, you know, we have the kind of cynical view,

2:37:38.480 --> 2:37:41.320
 power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.

2:37:41.320 --> 2:37:42.720
 And we tend to, in our mind,

2:37:42.720 --> 2:37:45.640
 generalize that all humans are corruptible.

2:37:45.640 --> 2:37:47.680
 And perhaps that's true to some degree,

2:37:47.680 --> 2:37:51.240
 but I think some people are more corruptible than others.

2:37:51.240 --> 2:37:53.480
 And I find that there is, I mean,

2:37:53.480 --> 2:37:58.000
 I like to think that Satoshi Nakamoto's out there

2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:00.720
 and, you know, just like George Washington

2:38:00.720 --> 2:38:03.320
 chose to walk away and it's a principle.

2:38:03.320 --> 2:38:05.160
 And the principle is more powerful

2:38:05.160 --> 2:38:09.080
 than the financial reward or any of those kinds of things.

2:38:10.160 --> 2:38:12.360
 It's a principle that stands for freedom.

2:38:12.360 --> 2:38:14.000
 And there's a lot of people throughout history,

2:38:14.000 --> 2:38:14.920
 even recent history,

2:38:14.920 --> 2:38:18.120
 that are willing to die for these principles

2:38:18.120 --> 2:38:23.120
 or live a life full of suffering and sacrifice

2:38:23.120 --> 2:38:27.000
 because they're still living a life of principle

2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:29.160
 and choosing that day after day after day.

2:38:29.160 --> 2:38:31.400
 So, I mean, there's power to that.

2:38:31.400 --> 2:38:34.000
 Money, what's the worth of money in the end?

2:38:35.080 --> 2:38:37.940
 In terms of just personal financial gain

2:38:37.940 --> 2:38:42.940
 versus knowing how much positive impact there is.

2:38:43.360 --> 2:38:46.240
 So the person that chooses to walk away like that,

2:38:46.240 --> 2:38:47.560
 I think is the same kind of person

2:38:47.560 --> 2:38:52.560
 that chooses to live by that principle.

2:38:52.560 --> 2:38:53.960
 You have people like that, you know,

2:38:53.960 --> 2:38:58.280
 in Grigori Grisha Perlman in mathematics

2:38:58.280 --> 2:39:01.760
 who turned down the Fields Medal because he was.

2:39:01.760 --> 2:39:05.640
 Yeah, that's a medal, not $50 billion of Bitcoin.

2:39:05.640 --> 2:39:06.820
 Well, that's, I.

2:39:06.820 --> 2:39:08.240
 No, I know, I know, I'm joking.

2:39:08.240 --> 2:39:10.920
 Well, that's actually an interesting, just a brief comment.

2:39:10.920 --> 2:39:12.640
 You know, when people talk about Bitcoin

2:39:12.640 --> 2:39:14.440
 in the cryptocurrency space,

2:39:14.440 --> 2:39:19.440
 that it's often mixed up financial interest and ideas.

2:39:19.440 --> 2:39:24.360
 And I think those are often correlated,

2:39:24.360 --> 2:39:27.600
 but that good feeling you get when you win

2:39:27.600 --> 2:39:31.680
 or number go up or you just,

2:39:31.680 --> 2:39:32.860
 just somebody, you know,

2:39:32.860 --> 2:39:35.760
 I found 20 bucks on the street the other day.

2:39:35.760 --> 2:39:38.120
 And just that feeling of just like,

2:39:38.120 --> 2:39:41.380
 ooh, like more money, that positive feeling,

2:39:41.380 --> 2:39:44.360
 that's correlated, but it is distinct

2:39:44.360 --> 2:39:47.480
 from the power of the idea to change a world,

2:39:47.480 --> 2:39:49.120
 to change the world for the better.

2:39:49.120 --> 2:39:51.560
 For the, to alleviate, it's like Alex Gladstein,

2:39:51.560 --> 2:39:53.000
 in the case of Bitcoin,

2:39:53.000 --> 2:39:55.200
 that decreased the amount of suffering in the world

2:39:55.200 --> 2:39:56.760
 because of the authoritarian regimes.

2:39:56.760 --> 2:40:00.320
 And just because your number goes up

2:40:00.320 --> 2:40:04.200
 like that gambling feeling of like, yes, yes, this is good.

2:40:04.200 --> 2:40:07.160
 And I mean, short term number go up.

2:40:07.160 --> 2:40:08.520
 There's a long term number go up

2:40:08.520 --> 2:40:10.800
 that's more like investment and so on.

2:40:10.800 --> 2:40:12.120
 And there's a short term number go up

2:40:12.120 --> 2:40:14.520
 that's just a good feeling that you can't,

2:40:14.520 --> 2:40:16.720
 you have to, in your mind, keep those distinct

2:40:16.720 --> 2:40:21.320
 from the power of the idea to transform the world.

2:40:21.320 --> 2:40:24.200
 And if you focus on the power of the idea,

2:40:24.200 --> 2:40:28.840
 maybe a billion or billions of dollars don't matter as much.

2:40:28.840 --> 2:40:30.400
 At least that's what I would like to believe.

2:40:30.400 --> 2:40:32.640
 Perhaps, but what matters ultimately

2:40:32.640 --> 2:40:34.280
 is that the thing works without him.

2:40:34.280 --> 2:40:35.880
 The thing's worked for 11 years without him.

2:40:35.880 --> 2:40:38.720
 And I think this is the really important thing.

2:40:38.720 --> 2:40:41.680
 If they had stuck around for whatever reason

2:40:41.680 --> 2:40:43.800
 and they had continued to meddle with it,

2:40:43.800 --> 2:40:46.360
 it's not clear to me how decentralized

2:40:46.360 --> 2:40:47.760
 it could have been.

2:40:47.760 --> 2:40:49.320
 This is the problem with the other currencies.

2:40:49.320 --> 2:40:52.560
 It's like, how do you lose control

2:40:52.560 --> 2:40:54.680
 of the Frankenstein that you've created?

2:40:54.680 --> 2:40:57.160
 The only way that this Frankenstein continues to survive

2:40:57.160 --> 2:41:00.240
 is if the person in charge of it continues to feed it.

2:41:00.240 --> 2:41:02.640
 And so it continues to be yours.

2:41:02.640 --> 2:41:03.560
 And that's the problem

2:41:03.560 --> 2:41:05.200
 with all the other digital currencies.

2:41:05.200 --> 2:41:07.320
 If you've heard about any of the other 16,000

2:41:07.320 --> 2:41:09.120
 digital currencies out there,

2:41:09.120 --> 2:41:10.040
 you've only heard about it

2:41:10.040 --> 2:41:11.920
 because there's a small group of people behind it

2:41:11.920 --> 2:41:14.440
 that are working on it, that are promoting it.

2:41:14.440 --> 2:41:17.080
 And that's why, and I think Michael Saylor's discussion

2:41:17.080 --> 2:41:19.560
 with you was a magnificent illustration

2:41:19.560 --> 2:41:23.000
 of the difference between Bitcoin and altcoins

2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:24.800
 in that they are securities.

2:41:24.800 --> 2:41:27.240
 And I think he makes a very compelling, brilliant case

2:41:27.240 --> 2:41:31.920
 for why this makes them categorically different

2:41:31.920 --> 2:41:32.760
 from Bitcoin.

2:41:32.760 --> 2:41:34.680
 Bitcoin, you're buying property.

2:41:34.680 --> 2:41:36.840
 I think he mentioned he's a huge fan of Dogecoin,

2:41:36.840 --> 2:41:38.120
 but I might be misremembering.

2:41:38.120 --> 2:41:39.200
 You are misremembering.

2:41:39.200 --> 2:41:40.520
 Okay, me too.

2:41:40.520 --> 2:41:42.840
 Maybe I'm quoting him out of context.

2:41:42.840 --> 2:41:47.800
 Okay, let me just ask you about some possible criticisms

2:41:47.800 --> 2:41:49.080
 of Bitcoin.

2:41:49.080 --> 2:41:52.480
 So on centralization, so there's a criticism

2:41:52.480 --> 2:41:55.960
 on the mining and on the node side,

2:41:55.960 --> 2:41:58.000
 or the node is not really the criticism,

2:41:58.000 --> 2:42:00.920
 but Bitcoin mining is not fully decentralized

2:42:00.920 --> 2:42:04.600
 because a small number of miners control a majority

2:42:04.600 --> 2:42:06.160
 of the hashing power.

2:42:06.160 --> 2:42:08.360
 I looked it up, there's 10,000, 15,000,

2:42:08.360 --> 2:42:11.880
 whatever the number is of computers that are full nodes,

2:42:11.880 --> 2:42:15.640
 that have the full, that are actively connected

2:42:15.640 --> 2:42:16.640
 to the network.

2:42:16.640 --> 2:42:18.320
 So you could argue that's decentralized

2:42:18.320 --> 2:42:20.440
 because it's global, it's all across the world,

2:42:20.440 --> 2:42:25.440
 but the miners, they're still, it's more centralized.

2:42:25.560 --> 2:42:27.360
 So if you're thinking of making a case

2:42:27.360 --> 2:42:30.200
 for Bitcoin being decentralized,

2:42:30.200 --> 2:42:34.400
 do you worry about the miners being somewhat centralized?

2:42:34.400 --> 2:42:37.400
 Is the nodes the important thing to think about?

2:42:37.400 --> 2:42:38.240
 Yeah.

2:42:38.240 --> 2:42:40.800
 And what number of nodes counts as centralized

2:42:40.800 --> 2:42:42.280
 and not?

2:42:42.280 --> 2:42:43.960
 The nodes are what matters because the nodes

2:42:43.960 --> 2:42:46.720
 are what determines Bitcoin's consensus parameters.

2:42:46.720 --> 2:42:51.720
 I think the best way to think about it is that miners

2:42:51.760 --> 2:42:54.720
 simply sell a commodity to the nodes

2:42:54.720 --> 2:42:56.920
 and that commodity is Bitcoin blocks.

2:42:56.920 --> 2:43:00.360
 So what a miner does is they solve the proof of work problem

2:43:00.360 --> 2:43:02.280
 so they keep operating their computers

2:43:02.280 --> 2:43:04.880
 until they can get a solution to the problem.

2:43:04.880 --> 2:43:07.000
 And then they attach that to a bunch of transactions

2:43:07.000 --> 2:43:10.160
 and present it to the nodes for the nodes to ratify

2:43:10.160 --> 2:43:11.480
 and approve it.

2:43:11.480 --> 2:43:14.280
 So therefore, this is, and this is,

2:43:14.280 --> 2:43:18.520
 I strongly recommend people learn about the 2017 block size

2:43:18.520 --> 2:43:21.680
 war to understand why miners don't control Bitcoin.

2:43:21.680 --> 2:43:25.080
 I discussed this briefly in my Bitcoin standard,

2:43:25.080 --> 2:43:27.760
 but there's a recent book that discusses this in detail

2:43:27.760 --> 2:43:30.640
 called The Block Size War by Jonathan Beer.

2:43:30.640 --> 2:43:33.800
 It's a great description of, in 2017,

2:43:33.800 --> 2:43:36.200
 essentially the miners thought that they can control Bitcoin.

2:43:36.200 --> 2:43:39.640
 You know, they had, there was one mining company

2:43:39.640 --> 2:43:42.360
 that produced the majority of the machines

2:43:42.360 --> 2:43:44.720
 that were on the network and they,

2:43:44.720 --> 2:43:48.320
 and their allies had control of the machines

2:43:48.320 --> 2:43:51.280
 that were out there and they controlled the majority

2:43:51.280 --> 2:43:53.000
 of the hash rate and they thought that they could change

2:43:53.000 --> 2:43:55.880
 Bitcoin's supply, not supply, sorry,

2:43:55.880 --> 2:43:57.760
 they could change Bitcoin's block size,

2:43:57.760 --> 2:44:01.960
 which is a tiny little detail, technical parameters,

2:44:01.960 --> 2:44:05.400
 not even all that big of a deal for the economics of it.

2:44:05.400 --> 2:44:08.280
 But they thought that they could pass this change,

2:44:08.280 --> 2:44:10.560
 they could force this change on the network.

2:44:10.560 --> 2:44:13.760
 And the members of the network rejected it

2:44:13.760 --> 2:44:15.160
 and they weren't able to do it.

2:44:15.160 --> 2:44:17.560
 So the nodes are what is sovereign.

2:44:17.560 --> 2:44:20.360
 The nodes are what determine the rules of the game.

2:44:20.360 --> 2:44:23.520
 The miners are a service provider.

2:44:23.520 --> 2:44:25.920
 The miners invest capital upfront.

2:44:25.920 --> 2:44:28.960
 You know, they buy the machines, they buy the electricity,

2:44:28.960 --> 2:44:31.560
 they buy the storage, they buy the locations,

2:44:31.560 --> 2:44:34.720
 they pay the rent, and they invest all of that money

2:44:34.720 --> 2:44:38.360
 based on the idea that if they behave according

2:44:38.360 --> 2:44:39.840
 to what the nodes want,

2:44:39.840 --> 2:44:42.160
 the nodes will reward them with Bitcoin.

2:44:42.160 --> 2:44:43.600
 So the miners are in no position

2:44:43.600 --> 2:44:45.040
 to dictate terms for anyone.

2:44:45.040 --> 2:44:47.800
 You know, they've put up their capital upfront

2:44:47.800 --> 2:44:51.640
 and they will only recoup it if they do what the nodes want.

2:44:51.640 --> 2:44:53.320
 So therefore what really matters

2:44:53.320 --> 2:44:54.880
 is the decentralization of the nodes.

2:44:54.880 --> 2:44:57.920
 So we wanna, you wanna have as many nodes as possible.

2:44:57.920 --> 2:44:59.840
 You should, you wanna have a system

2:44:59.840 --> 2:45:01.920
 where there's a large number of nodes.

2:45:01.920 --> 2:45:04.360
 And this is of course the biggest problem

2:45:04.360 --> 2:45:08.720
 with other digital currencies is that, you know,

2:45:08.720 --> 2:45:11.200
 because basically Bitcoin has cornered the market

2:45:11.200 --> 2:45:13.040
 on a digital currency,

2:45:13.040 --> 2:45:15.320
 the only way that you can really get traction

2:45:16.240 --> 2:45:18.120
 is to generate a whole bunch of buzzwords

2:45:18.120 --> 2:45:20.480
 about, you know, we're doing this and we're doing that.

2:45:20.480 --> 2:45:23.760
 And so other digital currencies are optimized

2:45:23.760 --> 2:45:27.920
 for bells and whistles and buzzwords.

2:45:27.920 --> 2:45:30.760
 And that means adding computational load,

2:45:30.760 --> 2:45:33.640
 which makes the nodes bigger, harder to operate,

2:45:33.640 --> 2:45:35.680
 and therefore you have a very small number of nodes.

2:45:35.680 --> 2:45:39.840
 In fact, very few digital currencies are keen

2:45:39.840 --> 2:45:42.040
 to publicize how many nodes there are,

2:45:42.040 --> 2:45:44.360
 and they don't have full nodes in the true sense.

2:45:44.360 --> 2:45:46.560
 And it doesn't even matter how many nodes they have

2:45:46.560 --> 2:45:51.560
 because de facto, you know, you can spin up a million nodes

2:45:53.120 --> 2:45:57.120
 tomorrow on AWS, doesn't really matter.

2:45:57.120 --> 2:46:00.280
 What matters is de facto do the nodes dictate

2:46:00.280 --> 2:46:02.240
 the rules of consensus.

2:46:02.240 --> 2:46:03.960
 And the fact that with most digital currencies

2:46:03.960 --> 2:46:06.160
 you can have hard forks very frequently

2:46:06.160 --> 2:46:08.200
 and they can change the supply all the time

2:46:08.200 --> 2:46:09.600
 means that there's a small group of people

2:46:09.600 --> 2:46:11.880
 who agree amongst themselves how to move forward.

2:46:11.880 --> 2:46:15.320
 Yeah, so you threw in a few criticisms of all coins there.

2:46:15.320 --> 2:46:17.200
 So one is the small group.

2:46:17.200 --> 2:46:18.760
 That one we could talk about.

2:46:18.760 --> 2:46:21.320
 It's a tricky one, and we talked about that

2:46:21.320 --> 2:46:22.680
 with Satoshi Nakamoto.

2:46:22.680 --> 2:46:25.720
 But the other one is small number of nodes

2:46:25.720 --> 2:46:27.320
 sort of to push back on that.

2:46:27.320 --> 2:46:29.000
 As computational power increases,

2:46:29.000 --> 2:46:32.600
 you can argue that that enables more and more

2:46:32.600 --> 2:46:35.720
 cheap computers to serve as nodes.

2:46:35.720 --> 2:46:38.000
 So at least it paints a future

2:46:38.000 --> 2:46:40.120
 where nodes are always increasing

2:46:40.120 --> 2:46:42.400
 because computational power is always increasing

2:46:42.400 --> 2:46:44.560
 and getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper.

2:46:44.560 --> 2:46:46.160
 So at least there's a hope for the future

2:46:46.160 --> 2:46:49.120
 for greater and greater decentralization

2:46:49.120 --> 2:46:50.440
 on the node front.

2:46:50.440 --> 2:46:52.840
 Yeah, but I mean, ultimately, again,

2:46:52.840 --> 2:46:55.440
 it doesn't really matter how many nodes you have

2:46:55.440 --> 2:46:59.520
 if the way that the currency is run

2:46:59.520 --> 2:47:01.720
 is that you're gonna have a hard fork every few months,

2:47:01.720 --> 2:47:03.520
 which is the case with most other currencies.

2:47:03.520 --> 2:47:06.040
 Bitcoin's the only one that's not have a hard fork.

2:47:07.120 --> 2:47:10.160
 Basically, the unique thing about Bitcoin

2:47:10.160 --> 2:47:12.200
 in a technical sense is that you could get

2:47:12.200 --> 2:47:16.840
 the original software that Satoshi himself ran in 2009

2:47:16.840 --> 2:47:18.520
 to start the network.

2:47:18.520 --> 2:47:21.680
 And you could run it today

2:47:21.680 --> 2:47:23.160
 and it would sync with the blockchain.

2:47:23.160 --> 2:47:25.400
 There's one bug you need to fix,

2:47:25.400 --> 2:47:28.440
 one mistake that would have only appeared

2:47:28.440 --> 2:47:31.560
 I think in around 2013 or 14 or something like that,

2:47:31.560 --> 2:47:33.000
 so that he wasn't aware of back then.

2:47:33.000 --> 2:47:35.480
 So you just need to fix this one tiny little bug.

2:47:35.480 --> 2:47:37.640
 And then the consensus parameters are still the same.

2:47:37.640 --> 2:47:39.360
 So you're able to sync to it.

2:47:39.360 --> 2:47:41.480
 This is not true for most other digital currencies.

2:47:41.480 --> 2:47:42.880
 I'd say probably all of them

2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:44.840
 because they've all had many hard forks,

2:47:44.840 --> 2:47:46.320
 which they think of as upgrades.

2:47:46.320 --> 2:47:49.360
 And they market this thing as,

2:47:49.360 --> 2:47:52.440
 well, Bitcoin can't upgrade, but we upgrade all the time.

2:47:52.440 --> 2:47:55.240
 Well, yeah, you know what else upgrades all the time?

2:47:55.240 --> 2:47:57.160
 Facebook, Apple, Amazon,

2:47:57.160 --> 2:47:59.360
 anything that centralizes is very easy to upgrade.

2:47:59.360 --> 2:48:01.400
 And that's precisely why, as Michael Saylor says,

2:48:01.400 --> 2:48:03.640
 these things are somebody's liability.

2:48:03.640 --> 2:48:04.600
 They are security.

2:48:04.600 --> 2:48:07.120
 You're carrying on somebody's technical

2:48:07.120 --> 2:48:08.720
 and economic liability.

2:48:08.720 --> 2:48:12.680
 They can hard fork, they can 10x the supply tomorrow.

2:48:12.680 --> 2:48:17.680
 Yeah, they can fall victim to the same corrupting forces

2:48:19.680 --> 2:48:21.800
 that governments fall victim to.

2:48:21.800 --> 2:48:22.960
 Sure, and for people who don't know,

2:48:22.960 --> 2:48:27.960
 yeah, hard fork is a reverse incompatible change

2:48:29.920 --> 2:48:34.240
 to the underlying function of a cryptocurrency.

2:48:35.120 --> 2:48:40.080
 Of course, there is hard forks of Bitcoin as well.

2:48:40.080 --> 2:48:43.240
 I'm sure all of which you love dearly.

2:48:43.240 --> 2:48:44.800
 Anyway, but that doesn't matter.

2:48:44.800 --> 2:48:47.160
 The original Bitcoin, for the most part,

2:48:47.160 --> 2:48:49.920
 has not undergone any changes.

2:48:49.920 --> 2:48:50.760
 And that's one of the...

2:48:50.760 --> 2:48:51.960
 I mean, it has undergone changes,

2:48:51.960 --> 2:48:56.960
 but none in the important parameters of the network.

2:48:57.200 --> 2:49:00.000
 So another criticism is about energy.

2:49:00.880 --> 2:49:02.640
 So the proof of work,

2:49:02.640 --> 2:49:05.160
 consensus mechanism uses a lot of energy.

2:49:06.160 --> 2:49:08.680
 What's the response to that criticism of Bitcoin?

2:49:08.680 --> 2:49:10.760
 Yes, because it's worth it.

2:49:12.200 --> 2:49:14.760
 Okay, the airplane uses a lot more energy than a kayak.

2:49:14.760 --> 2:49:16.840
 You know, when you're gonna cross the Atlantic next time,

2:49:16.840 --> 2:49:17.680
 what are you gonna take?

2:49:17.680 --> 2:49:19.640
 A kayak that is environmentally friendly,

2:49:19.640 --> 2:49:21.640
 according to this insane definition,

2:49:21.640 --> 2:49:22.840
 or are you gonna take an airplane

2:49:22.840 --> 2:49:24.040
 that consumes a lot of energy?

2:49:24.040 --> 2:49:26.800
 So the cost benefit analysis here,

2:49:28.040 --> 2:49:29.520
 essentially, you have to consider

2:49:29.520 --> 2:49:31.360
 both the cost and the benefit.

2:49:31.360 --> 2:49:34.880
 Exactly, and I think it's an astonishing testament

2:49:34.880 --> 2:49:38.520
 to just how far backward people's scientific

2:49:38.520 --> 2:49:41.400
 and technological thinking has devolved

2:49:41.400 --> 2:49:43.360
 to the point where we think of energy consumption

2:49:43.360 --> 2:49:44.200
 as a bad thing.

2:49:44.200 --> 2:49:45.040
 I think it's just...

2:49:45.040 --> 2:49:46.280
 And in the Fiat standard,

2:49:46.280 --> 2:49:48.920
 I discussed the whole hysteria around energy,

2:49:48.920 --> 2:49:52.760
 and I think it's a product of Fiat inflation

2:49:52.760 --> 2:49:55.160
 because it's a way of trying to covering up

2:49:55.160 --> 2:49:58.400
 the fact that energy fuels that are reliable

2:49:58.400 --> 2:50:00.560
 and necessary for the current world

2:50:00.560 --> 2:50:03.640
 are becoming more and more expensive because of inflation.

2:50:03.640 --> 2:50:05.800
 And so governments are always looking for excuses

2:50:05.800 --> 2:50:07.880
 for why you should not be using those things.

2:50:07.880 --> 2:50:10.160
 And so they promote all kinds of stupid pseudosciences

2:50:10.160 --> 2:50:13.320
 that tell you about why these things are bad.

2:50:13.320 --> 2:50:16.960
 But really, you know, all technology is...

2:50:16.960 --> 2:50:19.760
 Well, not all, but the vast majority

2:50:19.760 --> 2:50:22.160
 of technological innovations involve

2:50:22.160 --> 2:50:24.520
 economizing on human time and judgment

2:50:24.520 --> 2:50:26.000
 and replacing it with machines,

2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:28.440
 with reliable machines that spend a lot of energy.

2:50:28.440 --> 2:50:31.040
 So that's what a telephone does.

2:50:31.040 --> 2:50:33.200
 Instead of having to send somebody across the world

2:50:33.200 --> 2:50:36.120
 to tell somebody something else or send a letter,

2:50:36.120 --> 2:50:38.760
 a telephone allows you to do it.

2:50:38.760 --> 2:50:39.840
 The car is like that.

2:50:39.840 --> 2:50:43.040
 You could walk, but a car consumes a lot more energy,

2:50:43.040 --> 2:50:45.280
 but it allows you to travel much faster and safer

2:50:45.280 --> 2:50:47.200
 and more reliably.

2:50:47.200 --> 2:50:48.720
 An airplane is like that.

2:50:48.720 --> 2:50:52.440
 Modern telecommunication, human prosperity

2:50:52.440 --> 2:50:54.680
 is an increase in the consumption of energy.

2:50:54.680 --> 2:50:58.800
 And I think it is an absolutely criminal thing.

2:50:58.800 --> 2:51:01.640
 I mean, genuinely mean the word criminal

2:51:01.640 --> 2:51:04.840
 to portray energy consumption as a bad thing,

2:51:04.840 --> 2:51:07.280
 because it is truly depriving people of the chance

2:51:07.280 --> 2:51:10.320
 to live a life that makes life better, you know?

2:51:10.320 --> 2:51:12.480
 It's truly criminal to tell poor countries

2:51:12.480 --> 2:51:15.440
 that they should not consume the same energy sources

2:51:15.440 --> 2:51:17.720
 that are being used in rich countries

2:51:17.720 --> 2:51:21.880
 on which our modern infrastructure and modern life relies.

2:51:21.880 --> 2:51:22.800
 That's what life is.

2:51:22.800 --> 2:51:25.760
 You know, if you reduce the consumption of energy in the US

2:51:25.760 --> 2:51:28.520
 to the levels that you have in poor countries today,

2:51:28.520 --> 2:51:30.320
 the US would become desperately poor.

2:51:30.320 --> 2:51:31.440
 A lot of people would die.

2:51:31.440 --> 2:51:32.520
 Cities would collapse.

2:51:32.520 --> 2:51:34.560
 The quality of life would decrease significantly.

2:51:34.560 --> 2:51:37.120
 A high quality of life often requires,

2:51:37.120 --> 2:51:39.600
 given the current technology, a high expenditure of energy.

2:51:39.600 --> 2:51:41.080
 Yeah, and I should be clear, you know,

2:51:41.080 --> 2:51:42.760
 it's not a quality of life in the sense of,

2:51:42.760 --> 2:51:43.920
 many people think of this as,

2:51:43.920 --> 2:51:45.160
 oh yeah, well, you know,

2:51:46.560 --> 2:51:50.240
 taking needless flights for vacations.

2:51:50.240 --> 2:51:53.440
 No, no, these are the cherries on top of the cake,

2:51:53.440 --> 2:51:54.960
 but the substance of the cake

2:51:54.960 --> 2:51:56.920
 and the real benefits of energy

2:51:56.920 --> 2:52:00.800
 is the fact that children, premature babies,

2:52:00.800 --> 2:52:03.520
 survive in countries that have reliable

2:52:03.520 --> 2:52:05.560
 24 hour cheap electricity.

2:52:05.560 --> 2:52:07.200
 If your child is born premature,

2:52:07.200 --> 2:52:08.640
 that you put in an incubator,

2:52:08.640 --> 2:52:10.440
 put him in an incubator or her,

2:52:10.440 --> 2:52:11.840
 they're highly likely to survive.

2:52:11.840 --> 2:52:14.200
 If you don't have 24 hour electricity,

2:52:14.200 --> 2:52:16.040
 that child is not gonna make it.

2:52:16.040 --> 2:52:18.920
 And you see it, you know,

2:52:18.920 --> 2:52:20.760
 the level of energy consumption per capita

2:52:20.760 --> 2:52:23.400
 is highly correlated, not just to income,

2:52:23.400 --> 2:52:26.280
 but also to health outcomes, to infant mortality,

2:52:26.280 --> 2:52:28.440
 to all of the things that you care about.

2:52:28.440 --> 2:52:31.840
 And Bitcoin is just another technology.

2:52:31.840 --> 2:52:34.640
 It does consume a lot more energy than central banks.

2:52:34.640 --> 2:52:37.840
 A lot of Bitcoiners like to take a cop out of this

2:52:37.840 --> 2:52:40.120
 by saying, well, you know, central banks consume money

2:52:40.120 --> 2:52:42.720
 and ATMs consume a lot of energy.

2:52:42.720 --> 2:52:44.200
 And I think if you calculate

2:52:44.200 --> 2:52:45.880
 how much central banks and banks consume,

2:52:45.880 --> 2:52:47.040
 I think it's a rounding error

2:52:47.040 --> 2:52:49.680
 next to what Bitcoin consumes.

2:52:49.680 --> 2:52:52.160
 I think Bitcoin is just, maybe not a rounding error,

2:52:52.160 --> 2:52:54.520
 but it's still, Bitcoin I think is going to consume

2:52:54.520 --> 2:52:56.240
 a lot more, and that's a good thing.

2:52:56.240 --> 2:52:58.160
 You know what's humbling is to look,

2:52:58.160 --> 2:53:00.080
 because even just looking into this

2:53:00.080 --> 2:53:02.440
 forces me to look at the energy expenditures

2:53:02.440 --> 2:53:04.640
 for many of the things we take for granted.

2:53:04.640 --> 2:53:07.280
 Obviously computers and other digital,

2:53:07.280 --> 2:53:11.960
 our digital lives are just, Bitcoin becomes a rounding error

2:53:12.880 --> 2:53:15.040
 relative to how much energy is spent

2:53:15.040 --> 2:53:16.800
 on all the computers in our world.

2:53:16.800 --> 2:53:19.800
 But also things like home appliances,

2:53:19.800 --> 2:53:22.640
 microwaves, and hair dryers and stuff.

2:53:22.640 --> 2:53:23.480
 Yeah.

2:53:23.480 --> 2:53:24.360
 It's that.

2:53:24.360 --> 2:53:26.680
 Yeah, I mean, this is, that's being hilarious.

2:53:26.680 --> 2:53:28.280
 It's like, oh, these things

2:53:28.280 --> 2:53:31.360
 that are just part of our modern life,

2:53:31.360 --> 2:53:33.240
 they're either the same order,

2:53:33.240 --> 2:53:35.880
 at least the same order of magnitude as Bitcoin,

2:53:35.880 --> 2:53:39.280
 and they seem like trivial parts of life.

2:53:39.280 --> 2:53:40.600
 Yeah, and this is the thing,

2:53:40.600 --> 2:53:41.720
 all of the people that complain

2:53:41.720 --> 2:53:43.200
 about Bitcoin's energy consumption,

2:53:43.200 --> 2:53:45.080
 I presume they use washing machines.

2:53:45.080 --> 2:53:49.960
 Now, why should their desire for clean and dry clothes

2:53:51.000 --> 2:53:52.160
 get to consume energy?

2:53:52.160 --> 2:53:54.960
 And I mean, I used to live in Lebanon.

2:53:54.960 --> 2:53:56.320
 Lebanon had hyperinflation.

2:53:56.320 --> 2:53:58.920
 I escaped from hyperinflation.

2:53:58.920 --> 2:54:00.560
 I escaped, it prevented,

2:54:01.720 --> 2:54:03.600
 my life could have been ruined by hyperinflation.

2:54:03.600 --> 2:54:04.680
 And the reason that it wasn't ruined

2:54:04.680 --> 2:54:06.160
 is because I have Bitcoin.

2:54:06.160 --> 2:54:10.120
 So, I don't know, am I allowed to swear on your podcast?

2:54:10.120 --> 2:54:10.960
 Yes, please.

2:54:10.960 --> 2:54:12.120
 So, fuck your washing machine.

2:54:12.120 --> 2:54:16.600
 given a choice between my washing machine

2:54:16.600 --> 2:54:18.760
 and my Bitcoin, I'll choose Bitcoin.

2:54:18.760 --> 2:54:20.440
 It's a technology that has been,

2:54:20.440 --> 2:54:21.640
 that has already saved my life,

2:54:21.640 --> 2:54:22.760
 and I think it's gonna save the lives

2:54:22.760 --> 2:54:24.400
 of many, many, many, many more people.

2:54:24.400 --> 2:54:27.440
 So, but of course, I don't have to choose

2:54:27.440 --> 2:54:31.120
 between my Bitcoin and my washing machine

2:54:31.120 --> 2:54:33.280
 because this is, you know,

2:54:33.280 --> 2:54:35.160
 we're just constantly consuming more energy

2:54:35.160 --> 2:54:36.680
 and we're gonna continue to consume more energy

2:54:36.680 --> 2:54:39.880
 in this world, and that's just what progress is.

2:54:39.880 --> 2:54:41.480
 And a small remark.

2:54:41.480 --> 2:54:43.840
 So, in principle, I don't think this is a problem,

2:54:43.840 --> 2:54:45.000
 but the other thing about Bitcoin,

2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:47.360
 where it is different from washing machines,

2:54:47.360 --> 2:54:48.880
 Bitcoin is truly unique in this.

2:54:48.880 --> 2:54:52.840
 It's the only thing whose energy consumption

2:54:52.840 --> 2:54:55.200
 can be produced absolutely anywhere.

2:54:55.200 --> 2:54:57.280
 Your washing machine needs to be in your house

2:54:57.280 --> 2:54:58.920
 where you live, and you live in a city

2:54:58.920 --> 2:55:00.720
 surrounded by 10 million people,

2:55:00.720 --> 2:55:02.920
 and they all have their washing machines,

2:55:02.920 --> 2:55:04.520
 and they're all connected to the grid,

2:55:04.520 --> 2:55:06.520
 and they generally tend to do their laundry

2:55:06.520 --> 2:55:07.960
 around the same time.

2:55:07.960 --> 2:55:11.360
 And so you have to put the load of the washing machine

2:55:11.360 --> 2:55:14.360
 on the grid at the same time.

2:55:14.360 --> 2:55:16.320
 There needs to be one power plant

2:55:16.320 --> 2:55:17.920
 and all of the infrastructure needs to work

2:55:17.920 --> 2:55:19.200
 at the same time, and the electricity

2:55:19.200 --> 2:55:21.720
 is pretty expensive because it's being done

2:55:21.720 --> 2:55:23.360
 in a place with high demand.

2:55:23.360 --> 2:55:26.240
 Bitcoin does not need to buy electricity

2:55:26.240 --> 2:55:28.360
 from places where it has high demand

2:55:28.360 --> 2:55:30.320
 because it can buy electricity from anywhere.

2:55:30.320 --> 2:55:32.320
 This is what's truly mind blowing about it.

2:55:32.320 --> 2:55:35.600
 You can buy, you know, what you need,

2:55:35.600 --> 2:55:37.200
 the electricity that you need for mining

2:55:37.200 --> 2:55:38.280
 can be done anywhere.

2:55:38.280 --> 2:55:42.120
 So you can mine, you know, you can have a waterfall

2:55:42.120 --> 2:55:44.560
 in the north of Canada, 300 miles away

2:55:44.560 --> 2:55:46.480
 from any population center.

2:55:46.480 --> 2:55:48.520
 There's water falling, there's energy.

2:55:48.520 --> 2:55:51.120
 You can put a hydroelectric dam there,

2:55:51.120 --> 2:55:53.480
 and then you can use that energy to operate the miners,

2:55:53.480 --> 2:55:54.800
 and then the miners just need

2:55:54.800 --> 2:55:56.680
 a satellite internet connection,

2:55:56.680 --> 2:55:58.760
 and effectively you're selling that energy

2:55:58.760 --> 2:56:01.160
 that is isolated to the grid.

2:56:01.160 --> 2:56:02.920
 And because of the way that Bitcoin functions,

2:56:02.920 --> 2:56:04.840
 because of the difficulty adjustment,

2:56:04.840 --> 2:56:07.240
 the only profitable miners are the ones

2:56:07.240 --> 2:56:09.240
 who can get cheap electricity.

2:56:09.240 --> 2:56:11.680
 Basically if you're mining at grid cost,

2:56:11.680 --> 2:56:14.560
 if you're mining at around, the average electricity price

2:56:14.560 --> 2:56:16.760
 in the world is around 14 cents.

2:56:16.760 --> 2:56:19.160
 If you're mining at 14 cents in Bitcoin,

2:56:19.160 --> 2:56:21.360
 you're most likely not gonna make it.

2:56:21.360 --> 2:56:23.920
 If you're running your miners at 14 cents,

2:56:23.920 --> 2:56:26.040
 because everybody could mine at 14 cents,

2:56:26.040 --> 2:56:28.720
 and so what happens is if everybody's mining

2:56:28.720 --> 2:56:32.720
 at 14 cents, 14 cents stops being profitable,

2:56:32.720 --> 2:56:33.960
 and then only the people mining

2:56:33.960 --> 2:56:35.480
 at a lower price are profitable.

2:56:35.480 --> 2:56:38.360
 So that's why Bitcoin mining is not competing

2:56:38.360 --> 2:56:39.360
 with your washing machine.

2:56:39.360 --> 2:56:41.040
 This is the absurd thing

2:56:41.040 --> 2:56:45.480
 about this kind of energy scarcity viewpoint

2:56:45.480 --> 2:56:47.000
 where, oh no, it's a catastrophe,

2:56:47.000 --> 2:56:48.480
 Bitcoin is taking all the electricity,

2:56:48.480 --> 2:56:51.000
 as if the electricity is just one fixed pie

2:56:51.000 --> 2:56:53.160
 that we all have to share and fight over.

2:56:53.160 --> 2:56:54.960
 And this is how I keep making fun

2:56:54.960 --> 2:56:56.400
 of these stupid headlines they put out

2:56:56.400 --> 2:56:58.600
 where Bitcoin's consuming more electricity

2:56:58.600 --> 2:56:59.720
 than Portugal.

2:56:59.720 --> 2:57:03.080
 All right, well, maybe we should shut down Portugal then.

2:57:03.080 --> 2:57:04.880
 What the hell is Portugal giving us?

2:57:04.880 --> 2:57:07.240
 Like, obviously it's not, it's not competing.

2:57:07.240 --> 2:57:09.320
 He doesn't mean that, I've gotten so much criticism

2:57:09.320 --> 2:57:13.280
 for saying Cristiano Ronaldo's not in the top five.

2:57:13.280 --> 2:57:16.160
 I apologize, I love Portugal.

2:57:16.160 --> 2:57:18.640
 That's another discussion we should get into at some point.

2:57:18.640 --> 2:57:20.440
 Because you posted a few soccer things.

2:57:20.440 --> 2:57:23.440
 I'm not, I realize how passionate people are about this.

2:57:23.440 --> 2:57:25.040
 Listen, it was a joke, all right?

2:57:25.040 --> 2:57:27.520
 He deserves to be potentially in the top five.

2:57:27.520 --> 2:57:28.920
 Yeah, I love Portugal.

2:57:28.920 --> 2:57:30.400
 And even though I'm a Liverpool fan,

2:57:30.400 --> 2:57:32.440
 I still respect Cristiano Ronaldo a lot.

2:57:32.440 --> 2:57:35.520
 In fact, I hold a very unpopular opinion

2:57:35.520 --> 2:57:37.680
 where I think Cristiano Ronaldo's

2:57:37.680 --> 2:57:39.040
 the greatest football player ever.

2:57:39.040 --> 2:57:41.640
 Number one, over Pelé and Maradona, Messi,

2:57:41.640 --> 2:57:42.480
 better than Messi.

2:57:42.480 --> 2:57:44.120
 Yes, he's been doing it for 20 years at the top.

2:57:44.120 --> 2:57:45.000
 Nobody's ever done that.

2:57:45.000 --> 2:57:46.520
 He's won everything everywhere,

2:57:46.520 --> 2:57:49.240
 everywhere he goes at the top, at the Champions League.

2:57:50.320 --> 2:57:53.080
 Really strong argument to be made for him.

2:57:53.080 --> 2:57:55.120
 Messi's never done anything outside of Barcelona,

2:57:55.120 --> 2:57:55.960
 that's the thing.

2:57:55.960 --> 2:57:59.400
 So you appreciate performance, long term,

2:57:59.400 --> 2:58:03.620
 versus the genius of the actual play on the field.

2:58:04.600 --> 2:58:05.760
 I mean, the genius is,

2:58:05.760 --> 2:58:07.640
 Ronaldo's the top scorer of all time.

2:58:07.640 --> 2:58:08.480
 He scores more goals.

2:58:08.480 --> 2:58:09.320
 So the genius is in the scoring,

2:58:09.320 --> 2:58:13.480
 not the actual dance of the play, the creativity.

2:58:13.480 --> 2:58:14.680
 Well, I mean, I don't know,

2:58:14.680 --> 2:58:18.240
 Messi's been absolutely mediocre since he's left Barcelona.

2:58:18.240 --> 2:58:20.080
 These are strong words.

2:58:20.080 --> 2:58:23.240
 He scored, what, two goals in PSG season this year?

2:58:23.240 --> 2:58:25.000
 They're out of the Champions League.

2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:26.600
 What about Mohamed Salah?

2:58:26.600 --> 2:58:28.040
 You posted about him.

2:58:28.040 --> 2:58:31.520
 Is he climbing up to be someone?

2:58:31.520 --> 2:58:33.080
 I think he should win the Ballon dOr this year.

2:58:33.080 --> 2:58:34.780
 He probably should have won it last year as well.

2:58:34.780 --> 2:58:36.240
 He's been absolutely outstanding,

2:58:36.240 --> 2:58:39.740
 but I mean, just people are so crazy about Messi.

2:58:39.740 --> 2:58:40.800
 They keep giving him accolades.

2:58:40.800 --> 2:58:41.840
 He hasn't deserved, I think,

2:58:41.840 --> 2:58:45.040
 Messi the last couple of Ballon dOrs that he got.

2:58:45.040 --> 2:58:46.400
 I mean, he's a great player and everything,

2:58:46.400 --> 2:58:49.300
 but no, he did not deserve it last year.

2:58:51.800 --> 2:58:53.940
 We can agree to disagree.

2:58:53.940 --> 2:58:54.780
 There's something.

2:58:54.780 --> 2:58:56.800
 Do you think you're a Barca fan or a Messi fan?

2:58:56.800 --> 2:58:59.600
 I would say, no, I wouldn't say I'm a Barca fan,

2:58:59.600 --> 2:59:01.280
 but a Barca fan because of Messi,

2:59:01.280 --> 2:59:04.700
 and I just, I think it's like, there's certain things.

2:59:06.760 --> 2:59:09.840
 So when I was growing up in the Soviet Union, Russia,

2:59:09.840 --> 2:59:14.840
 I remember Maradona, he was the first person I saw

2:59:15.180 --> 2:59:17.620
 that I was like, oh, wow, this could be,

2:59:19.480 --> 2:59:22.280
 this is greatness in sport, not just football and sport,

2:59:22.280 --> 2:59:23.680
 right, and for some reason.

2:59:23.680 --> 2:59:26.760
 I mean, it's something about Diego Armando Maradona,

2:59:26.760 --> 2:59:30.160
 the way they were commentating the genius of his play,

2:59:30.160 --> 2:59:32.960
 the mix of ego, and again, the performance,

2:59:32.960 --> 2:59:35.400
 but being able to carry a team on his shoulders,

2:59:35.400 --> 2:59:38.680
 that, I just fell in love with whatever he represented,

2:59:38.680 --> 2:59:41.560
 and then by that, Argentina, and then Messi,

2:59:41.560 --> 2:59:46.120
 I saw when he was 16, 17, when he was just in the early days,

2:59:46.120 --> 2:59:49.560
 and when you first see a person and you see the genius

2:59:49.560 --> 2:59:51.660
 and you notice that, and then it turns out

2:59:51.660 --> 2:59:54.080
 to be actually a great player, for some reason,

2:59:54.080 --> 2:59:57.440
 you're invested, you're emotionally invested,

2:59:57.440 --> 3:00:00.560
 you're, I don't know, so you kind of just fall in love

3:00:00.560 --> 3:00:03.060
 and then you get, you pick sides.

3:00:03.060 --> 3:00:04.560
 I mean, that's the thing about football.

3:00:04.560 --> 3:00:07.640
 Part of the fun things about football, soccer,

3:00:07.640 --> 3:00:11.200
 is like, you pick a guy, you pick a team,

3:00:11.200 --> 3:00:13.780
 and fuck everyone else, and you just have fun talking shit.

3:00:13.780 --> 3:00:15.440
 I mean, that's part of it, you know?

3:00:15.440 --> 3:00:18.360
 It's great, it's great because I think,

3:00:18.360 --> 3:00:19.760
 obviously it's a very stupid thing to do,

3:00:19.760 --> 3:00:21.800
 but I think if you don't do it in football,

3:00:21.800 --> 3:00:22.640
 you're gonna do it in real life.

3:00:22.640 --> 3:00:23.800
 Elsewhere, that's right.

3:00:23.800 --> 3:00:26.240
 That's why it's very good, like, that's it.

3:00:26.240 --> 3:00:28.360
 Instead of hating people for their religion

3:00:28.360 --> 3:00:31.000
 and for their skin color, hate them

3:00:31.000 --> 3:00:32.440
 because they support Manchester United.

3:00:32.440 --> 3:00:33.960
 Exactly.

3:00:33.960 --> 3:00:35.160
 So you're a Liverpool fan, that's it.

3:00:35.160 --> 3:00:37.300
 Yes, yes, hardcore, long term.

3:00:38.860 --> 3:00:41.820
 But yeah, so to go back to the original point on Portugal.

3:00:41.820 --> 3:00:42.660
 Energy.

3:00:42.660 --> 3:00:43.500
 Yeah, energy.

3:00:43.500 --> 3:00:45.900
 Bitcoin is not competing with Portugal

3:00:45.900 --> 3:00:47.400
 because Bitcoin is buying energy

3:00:47.400 --> 3:00:49.220
 from places where we can't buy it,

3:00:49.220 --> 3:00:52.240
 because all the places where we can buy energy

3:00:52.240 --> 3:00:55.360
 for our washing machines, we're bidding up the price

3:00:55.360 --> 3:00:58.000
 enough to make it nonviable for Bitcoin.

3:00:58.000 --> 3:01:00.240
 That's why, you know, you'll see those headlines

3:01:00.240 --> 3:01:02.360
 about Bitcoin consuming more energy than Portugal.

3:01:02.360 --> 3:01:04.200
 Well, if you look at Portugal, I mean,

3:01:04.200 --> 3:01:06.080
 they've got giant power plants in Portugal,

3:01:06.080 --> 3:01:07.400
 they've got millions of people,

3:01:07.400 --> 3:01:09.720
 and they've got enormous amounts of infrastructure.

3:01:09.720 --> 3:01:13.200
 Where are all of these infrastructure for Bitcoin mining?

3:01:13.200 --> 3:01:14.840
 You don't see it in the cities.

3:01:14.840 --> 3:01:18.800
 It's all isolated, it's all out away from the cities,

3:01:18.800 --> 3:01:21.920
 or it's connected to grids that have serious overcapacity.

3:01:21.920 --> 3:01:25.160
 So Bitcoin is not out there buying the expensive energy,

3:01:25.160 --> 3:01:29.120
 taking energy away from people who can't afford it.

3:01:29.120 --> 3:01:30.860
 It's out there buying its own energy

3:01:30.860 --> 3:01:32.600
 because it doesn't need to buy the expensive energy

3:01:32.600 --> 3:01:34.400
 that people really need.

3:01:34.400 --> 3:01:37.440
 So one other criticism from an investment perspective,

3:01:37.440 --> 3:01:39.440
 from a gambling perspective that people see

3:01:39.440 --> 3:01:41.520
 is the volatility of Bitcoin.

3:01:41.520 --> 3:01:44.000
 Of course, that's been somewhat decreasing over time,

3:01:44.000 --> 3:01:48.640
 but what's your answer to the sort of criticism

3:01:48.640 --> 3:01:51.360
 that Bitcoin is too volatile, I wanna stay away,

3:01:51.360 --> 3:01:53.320
 it doesn't seem like a safe place for me

3:01:53.320 --> 3:01:57.020
 to invest either short term or long term?

3:01:57.020 --> 3:01:58.520
 There's no denying there's a volatility

3:01:58.520 --> 3:02:00.320
 and there's a high oscillation in the value

3:02:00.320 --> 3:02:01.160
 in the short term.

3:02:01.160 --> 3:02:05.360
 So I think the safe way to approach that

3:02:05.360 --> 3:02:07.760
 is in terms of position sizing.

3:02:07.760 --> 3:02:10.560
 If the volatility bothers you,

3:02:10.560 --> 3:02:12.720
 then you're overinvested perhaps.

3:02:12.720 --> 3:02:17.480
 So maybe you should reduce the size of your position

3:02:17.480 --> 3:02:19.640
 so that the volatility doesn't bother you.

3:02:19.640 --> 3:02:23.240
 And this is the short answer that you know,

3:02:23.240 --> 3:02:26.680
 like stack as much as your conviction

3:02:26.680 --> 3:02:28.880
 will allow you to tolerate the volatility.

3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:33.360
 And of course, the reason you should try

3:02:33.360 --> 3:02:36.200
 and consider tolerating volatility more

3:02:36.200 --> 3:02:40.440
 is the options are you hold fiat assets,

3:02:40.440 --> 3:02:43.800
 which only go down stable, relatively stable,

3:02:43.800 --> 3:02:46.120
 not a lot of volatility day to day,

3:02:46.120 --> 3:02:50.600
 value of your dollar doesn't change 40% overnight,

3:02:50.600 --> 3:02:52.880
 20% overnight or something like that.

3:02:52.880 --> 3:02:56.120
 But it does go down reliably, it's gonna go down 40%.

3:02:56.120 --> 3:02:58.040
 You can count on it, it might take a year,

3:02:58.040 --> 3:02:59.900
 two years, five years, 10 years,

3:02:59.900 --> 3:03:01.760
 compared to the things that you want to buy,

3:03:01.760 --> 3:03:04.360
 it's gonna go down by 40%.

3:03:04.360 --> 3:03:05.960
 And it's not gonna come back

3:03:05.960 --> 3:03:07.560
 and it's gonna go down another 40%

3:03:07.560 --> 3:03:09.720
 and then another 40% and then another 40%.

3:03:09.720 --> 3:03:14.720
 So the option really is relatively short term stability

3:03:14.720 --> 3:03:16.520
 with long term decline,

3:03:16.520 --> 3:03:19.680
 or short term volatility with long term rise.

3:03:19.680 --> 3:03:22.640
 And so that's another way in which Bitcoin teaches people

3:03:22.640 --> 3:03:24.760
 to have a low time preference and think about the long term.

3:03:24.760 --> 3:03:29.240
 So stack, accumulate and think of it in the long term.

3:03:29.240 --> 3:03:31.200
 It's a function of the fact that Bitcoin is new.

3:03:31.200 --> 3:03:32.960
 Bitcoin is currently less than 1%

3:03:32.960 --> 3:03:34.200
 of the global money market.

3:03:34.200 --> 3:03:36.520
 So there's about $100 trillion of money

3:03:36.520 --> 3:03:37.560
 out there in the world.

3:03:37.560 --> 3:03:40.600
 $100 trillion roughly of fiat

3:03:40.600 --> 3:03:42.800
 and about $10 trillion of gold.

3:03:42.800 --> 3:03:44.880
 And Bitcoin is less than $1 trillion.

3:03:44.880 --> 3:03:48.400
 So one rich guy decides to get into Bitcoin,

3:03:48.400 --> 3:03:50.160
 that's gonna show up on the Bitcoin chart.

3:03:50.160 --> 3:03:52.960
 You look at it, Elon Musk decides to buy Bitcoin,

3:03:52.960 --> 3:03:55.160
 you see the buy, you see the news,

3:03:55.160 --> 3:03:57.840
 it happens and you see the pump.

3:03:57.840 --> 3:03:59.880
 Elon Musk decides that he doesn't like Bitcoin,

3:03:59.880 --> 3:04:01.200
 you see the drop.

3:04:01.200 --> 3:04:03.160
 But a few years ago, it used to be

3:04:03.160 --> 3:04:07.200
 that one random millionaire would cause that pump.

3:04:07.200 --> 3:04:09.800
 Now you have to be the richest guy in the world to do that.

3:04:09.800 --> 3:04:11.600
 In a few years, you're gonna have to be

3:04:11.600 --> 3:04:14.080
 the richest country in the world to be able to do that

3:04:14.080 --> 3:04:15.920
 to the Bitcoin price, maybe many years,

3:04:15.920 --> 3:04:17.160
 maybe not a few years.

3:04:17.160 --> 3:04:19.120
 But as Bitcoin grows, think about it

3:04:19.120 --> 3:04:22.240
 as a liquid pool of money.

3:04:22.240 --> 3:04:25.280
 Currently it's a small pool next to a much larger ocean,

3:04:25.280 --> 3:04:26.800
 which is the entire money market.

3:04:26.800 --> 3:04:30.520
 And so one person jumps from that to this small pool,

3:04:30.520 --> 3:04:32.160
 they can make a big splash.

3:04:32.160 --> 3:04:36.120
 As the pool grows, essentially the salability increases

3:04:36.120 --> 3:04:38.840
 and the likelihood of one individual purchase

3:04:38.840 --> 3:04:43.320
 affecting the price so violently decreases.

3:04:43.320 --> 3:04:46.800
 And so over time, as the size of the market increases,

3:04:46.800 --> 3:04:48.920
 I think we're gonna see the volatility decline

3:04:48.920 --> 3:04:49.760
 more and more.

3:04:49.760 --> 3:04:52.840
 Ultimately, if you look at gold historically,

3:04:52.840 --> 3:04:54.680
 gold has been very, very stable.

3:04:54.680 --> 3:04:56.360
 It did not achieve its stability

3:04:56.360 --> 3:04:58.600
 because the central bank was in charge of gold supply

3:04:58.600 --> 3:05:00.880
 or because there was a gold committee

3:05:00.880 --> 3:05:02.920
 that decided how much gold gets produced.

3:05:03.960 --> 3:05:06.760
 It achieved that stability because it became

3:05:06.760 --> 3:05:09.880
 the most saleable good and so therefore became the good

3:05:09.880 --> 3:05:12.880
 that contains the most cash balances in the world.

3:05:12.880 --> 3:05:14.080
 And the end of the 19th century,

3:05:14.080 --> 3:05:16.840
 everybody held cash balances in gold

3:05:16.840 --> 3:05:20.720
 and new production was a tiny little addition

3:05:20.720 --> 3:05:23.680
 to global production, to the supply.

3:05:23.680 --> 3:05:26.880
 So that's what made gold the most relatively,

3:05:26.880 --> 3:05:27.920
 I shouldn't say stable

3:05:27.920 --> 3:05:29.800
 because nothing is stable in economics,

3:05:29.800 --> 3:05:31.920
 but relatively it holds onto its value

3:05:31.920 --> 3:05:35.120
 and it's much less volatile than digital currency,

3:05:35.120 --> 3:05:37.240
 than national currencies.

3:05:37.240 --> 3:05:41.280
 That's because it has the highest stock to flow ratio

3:05:41.280 --> 3:05:45.920
 and that's because its supply is a tiny fraction

3:05:45.920 --> 3:05:47.360
 of the liquid market.

3:05:47.360 --> 3:05:48.840
 And as the liquid market grows,

3:05:48.840 --> 3:05:50.400
 as the size of cash balances grows

3:05:50.400 --> 3:05:52.920
 and trades in Bitcoin cancel each other out,

3:05:54.000 --> 3:05:56.920
 you get only slight changes in value.

3:05:56.920 --> 3:06:01.040
 So I think as Bitcoin matures, that's going to decline.

3:06:01.040 --> 3:06:03.680
 So effectively, I think the end game

3:06:03.680 --> 3:06:08.680
 is Bitcoin is huge, Bitcoin is worth something like,

3:06:08.760 --> 3:06:11.720
 I think the total addressable market for Bitcoin

3:06:11.720 --> 3:06:14.000
 is not just national currencies

3:06:14.000 --> 3:06:16.560
 and gold's addressable market, but also government bonds.

3:06:16.560 --> 3:06:17.920
 That's the really big one.

3:06:17.920 --> 3:06:20.160
 So how do banks compare to gold?

3:06:20.160 --> 3:06:23.240
 So you're saying it'll surpass gold, the 10 trillion?

3:06:23.240 --> 3:06:24.080
 Yeah.

3:06:24.080 --> 3:06:25.240
 What's bonds?

3:06:25.240 --> 3:06:26.880
 Where does bonds stand?

3:06:26.880 --> 3:06:28.840
 So then there's also national currencies,

3:06:28.840 --> 3:06:30.040
 which are about 100 trillion

3:06:30.040 --> 3:06:31.160
 and then there's government bonds,

3:06:31.160 --> 3:06:36.160
 which are around $120 billion, sorry, trillion dollars.

3:06:36.320 --> 3:06:37.160
 Trillion.

3:06:37.160 --> 3:06:38.000
 Trillion, sorry.

3:06:38.000 --> 3:06:38.840
 Yes, trillion.

3:06:38.840 --> 3:06:40.400
 If we're saying billion, we meant trillion.

3:06:40.400 --> 3:06:41.240
 Yeah.

3:06:42.800 --> 3:06:46.240
 So you think bonds can move to Bitcoin?

3:06:46.240 --> 3:06:50.120
 I've always held this is the prize, this is the main dish.

3:06:50.120 --> 3:06:52.680
 Gold is the appetizer, bonds are the main dish

3:06:52.680 --> 3:06:53.520
 because bonds have replaced gold.

3:06:53.520 --> 3:06:54.720
 I have an appetizer.

3:06:54.720 --> 3:06:56.640
 Yeah.

3:06:56.640 --> 3:06:59.880
 I mean, bonds have replaced gold in people's portfolio.

3:06:59.880 --> 3:07:02.520
 People, you remember when we were saying gold was,

3:07:02.520 --> 3:07:04.080
 you'd hold it as a saving,

3:07:04.080 --> 3:07:05.560
 as the secure part of your portfolio

3:07:05.560 --> 3:07:08.120
 and then you take risk with the equity.

3:07:08.120 --> 3:07:09.120
 Currently people do that

3:07:09.120 --> 3:07:11.520
 by holding a part of their portfolio in bonds.

3:07:11.520 --> 3:07:14.720
 That's the part that they treat as their saving account.

3:07:14.720 --> 3:07:18.160
 And then the rest they use for not speculation,

3:07:18.160 --> 3:07:19.920
 for investment in which they take risk.

3:07:19.920 --> 3:07:21.360
 Yeah, speculation.

3:07:21.360 --> 3:07:26.360
 And that's stocks and equity and other high risk assets.

3:07:27.360 --> 3:07:29.720
 I think Bitcoin is not gonna replace equity.

3:07:29.720 --> 3:07:30.840
 There will always be equity.

3:07:30.840 --> 3:07:31.760
 There'll always be companies

3:07:31.760 --> 3:07:34.160
 and people will wanna have equity.

3:07:34.160 --> 3:07:35.640
 But it'll probably replace a big chunk

3:07:35.640 --> 3:07:36.880
 of current equity markets

3:07:36.880 --> 3:07:39.120
 because right now, if you want to save,

3:07:39.120 --> 3:07:40.560
 it used to be that you hold bonds.

3:07:40.560 --> 3:07:43.400
 Now, if you wanna save, you go into stock indexes.

3:07:43.400 --> 3:07:46.160
 So I think Bitcoin likely eats a big chunk

3:07:46.160 --> 3:07:49.600
 of equity markets because currently it's,

3:07:49.600 --> 3:07:51.120
 people are using it as saving.

3:07:51.120 --> 3:07:53.440
 And I think it eats all the bonds.

3:07:53.440 --> 3:07:56.800
 That's my most ambitious statement.

3:07:56.800 --> 3:08:00.560
 The question is the scale of time that happens across,

3:08:00.560 --> 3:08:03.520
 but the most important statement you make is about trend.

3:08:03.520 --> 3:08:05.600
 Yeah, and also, I mean, let's also remember

3:08:05.600 --> 3:08:08.880
 currently bonds nominally don't beat inflation

3:08:08.880 --> 3:08:09.880
 and in real terms,

3:08:09.880 --> 3:08:13.320
 they don't come close to beating inflation.

3:08:13.320 --> 3:08:15.800
 So currently with bonds,

3:08:15.800 --> 3:08:19.640
 you're taking on credit default risk to buy a bond

3:08:19.640 --> 3:08:23.720
 and also getting less money back in real terms.

3:08:23.720 --> 3:08:26.120
 Well, Bitcoin doesn't offer you returns,

3:08:26.120 --> 3:08:28.160
 but in real terms, it appreciates much more

3:08:28.160 --> 3:08:31.320
 and it has, I believe, a lot less risk associated with it

3:08:31.320 --> 3:08:34.000
 than any company or government.

3:08:34.000 --> 3:08:35.480
 So let's make things spicy

3:08:35.480 --> 3:08:39.380
 and ask if Bitcoin fails in the long term future.

3:08:40.280 --> 3:08:43.240
 As you just said, economics, volatility,

3:08:43.240 --> 3:08:44.960
 things happen in this world.

3:08:44.960 --> 3:08:48.400
 The human civilization might end in this century.

3:08:48.400 --> 3:08:50.200
 I hope it doesn't, but it might.

3:08:50.200 --> 3:08:52.120
 There could be catastrophic events.

3:08:52.120 --> 3:08:57.120
 If Bitcoin fails, it goes to zero, loses its number one spot.

3:08:57.360 --> 3:08:58.840
 What would be the reason?

3:08:58.840 --> 3:09:03.840
 If you're an alien visiting Earth 100 years from now

3:09:03.840 --> 3:09:05.840
 and just were to analyze the situation,

3:09:05.840 --> 3:09:07.920
 Bitcoin is a pretty new thing.

3:09:07.920 --> 3:09:10.480
 So the possible trajectories of how the world evolves

3:09:10.480 --> 3:09:13.200
 together with this new monetary technology

3:09:13.200 --> 3:09:15.080
 is nearly infinite.

3:09:15.080 --> 3:09:17.280
 So if it fails, one of those trajectories

3:09:17.280 --> 3:09:19.360
 surely involves Bitcoin failing.

3:09:19.360 --> 3:09:21.360
 What would be the reason?

3:09:21.360 --> 3:09:23.680
 I think the most likely reason that it could fail,

3:09:23.680 --> 3:09:25.800
 I don't think this is likely in general,

3:09:25.800 --> 3:09:27.280
 but I think it is the most likely

3:09:27.280 --> 3:09:30.480
 of all the unlikely things that could destroy Bitcoin,

3:09:30.480 --> 3:09:33.240
 is governments go back on a gold standard.

3:09:34.240 --> 3:09:35.360
 Oh, interesting.

3:09:35.360 --> 3:09:38.320
 So they make, in your view, a better decision

3:09:38.320 --> 3:09:41.440
 than the current system, just not the best decision.

3:09:41.440 --> 3:09:42.280
 Yeah.

3:09:42.280 --> 3:09:44.040
 I thought you would go much darker.

3:09:44.040 --> 3:09:47.440
 But, so that's, yeah, okay, interesting.

3:09:47.440 --> 3:09:50.020
 So maybe because of Russia, because of China and so on,

3:09:50.020 --> 3:09:52.160
 because of the current war,

3:09:52.160 --> 3:09:57.160
 they might reconsider the power that America holds

3:09:57.560 --> 3:09:59.240
 because of the monetary,

3:09:59.240 --> 3:10:01.120
 because it being the primary currency,

3:10:01.120 --> 3:10:05.520
 and they'll start thinking about going on a gold standard.

3:10:05.520 --> 3:10:08.160
 Yeah, but it would also require the US and the Europeans

3:10:08.160 --> 3:10:10.280
 and everybody to want to join in this system

3:10:10.280 --> 3:10:13.200
 and sing Kumbaya and play nice with each other

3:10:13.200 --> 3:10:15.280
 around the gold standard.

3:10:15.280 --> 3:10:17.160
 I think, you know, given that gold already

3:10:17.160 --> 3:10:19.560
 is about 10 times larger than Bitcoin,

3:10:19.560 --> 3:10:21.320
 so it has a first mover advantage,

3:10:23.440 --> 3:10:25.640
 if governments were to go and peg their currencies

3:10:25.640 --> 3:10:30.640
 to gold again, the price of gold would shoot up 5, 10x,

3:10:30.720 --> 3:10:33.480
 and it would rise in value a lot more.

3:10:33.480 --> 3:10:36.120
 Of course, that doesn't necessarily kill Bitcoin.

3:10:36.120 --> 3:10:37.800
 No, again, I'm not saying it's likely to happen.

3:10:37.800 --> 3:10:41.400
 I'm saying it's, I imagine, less likely,

3:10:41.400 --> 3:10:44.280
 less unlikely than all the other unlikely scenarios.

3:10:44.280 --> 3:10:46.560
 Because, you know, even with a nuclear war,

3:10:46.560 --> 3:10:50.320
 like 90% of the planet is destroyed,

3:10:50.320 --> 3:10:52.960
 the 10% continue to run Bitcoin.

3:10:55.880 --> 3:10:57.160
 That's a quote.

3:10:57.160 --> 3:10:59.400
 Okay, there's a movement,

3:10:59.400 --> 3:11:03.520
 a community of people referred to as Bitcoin maximalists.

3:11:03.520 --> 3:11:05.640
 I've seen you referred, at least in the past,

3:11:05.640 --> 3:11:10.160
 as the leader of the Bitcoin maximalists,

3:11:10.160 --> 3:11:12.320
 probably because of your book,

3:11:12.320 --> 3:11:14.720
 Bitcoin Standard, consider the Bible in general.

3:11:14.720 --> 3:11:16.680
 You're one of the leaders in this space.

3:11:18.200 --> 3:11:22.000
 Do you regret any of the toxicity and derision

3:11:22.000 --> 3:11:25.760
 that often or perhaps sometimes originates

3:11:25.760 --> 3:11:26.760
 from this community?

3:11:28.080 --> 3:11:28.960
 Definitely not.

3:11:28.960 --> 3:11:31.640
 I'm not in the position to regret other people's actions,

3:11:31.640 --> 3:11:33.280
 so let's just be clear.

3:11:33.280 --> 3:11:36.260
 I think the rhetoric of community is,

3:11:37.360 --> 3:11:41.160
 I reject this rhetoric because I think it's a way

3:11:41.160 --> 3:11:45.880
 for kind of political manipulation and subversion

3:11:45.880 --> 3:11:49.640
 to try and portray people as part of a community

3:11:49.640 --> 3:11:52.100
 and hold people responsible for other people's actions,

3:11:52.100 --> 3:11:53.440
 which I think is ridiculous.

3:11:53.440 --> 3:11:55.700
 So, you know, some guy on the internet

3:11:55.700 --> 3:11:57.520
 said something mean to somebody,

3:11:57.520 --> 3:11:59.440
 and then this is very common,

3:11:59.440 --> 3:12:03.480
 and I always try and not get involved in these things.

3:12:03.480 --> 3:12:05.520
 So some guy who identifies as a Bitcoiner

3:12:05.520 --> 3:12:08.360
 says something to somebody that's very wrong.

3:12:08.360 --> 3:12:09.520
 Of course it happens.

3:12:09.520 --> 3:12:13.440
 Tens of millions of people use Bitcoin around the world,

3:12:13.440 --> 3:12:16.680
 and a lot of these, I'd say parasites,

3:12:16.680 --> 3:12:18.280
 people who don't have anything productive

3:12:18.280 --> 3:12:21.600
 to do with their life, you know, outrage merchants,

3:12:21.600 --> 3:12:24.080
 they'll come out and say something along the lines of,

3:12:24.080 --> 3:12:27.880
 you know, the Bitcoin maximalists are toxic,

3:12:27.880 --> 3:12:30.360
 they're holding Bitcoin back, and they need,

3:12:30.360 --> 3:12:31.440
 and of course it's manipulative.

3:12:31.440 --> 3:12:34.440
 The point behind it is they want to get to you,

3:12:34.440 --> 3:12:36.280
 they want to get people who are, you know,

3:12:36.280 --> 3:12:38.240
 not that nobody with 300 followers

3:12:38.240 --> 3:12:40.360
 who said something silly,

3:12:40.360 --> 3:12:42.800
 they want to get the notable people

3:12:42.800 --> 3:12:44.600
 to basically change their message.

3:12:44.600 --> 3:12:47.680
 So the idea is, you know, I'm supposed to apologize

3:12:47.680 --> 3:12:49.160
 because somebody with 300 followers

3:12:49.160 --> 3:12:52.520
 I've never met in my life who calls themselves a Bitcoiner

3:12:52.520 --> 3:12:55.080
 said a mean word, and then I need to apologize,

3:12:55.080 --> 3:12:57.160
 and I also need to cut down on my rhetoric

3:12:57.160 --> 3:13:00.500
 about other digital currencies, and I need to do that.

3:13:00.500 --> 3:13:03.600
 So I'm only responsible for my own actions,

3:13:03.600 --> 3:13:07.040
 and I don't recall regretting anything.

3:13:07.040 --> 3:13:08.560
 Okay, but let me push back

3:13:08.560 --> 3:13:10.240
 or push further into that direction.

3:13:10.240 --> 3:13:11.880
 Fine, let's leave community aside.

3:13:11.880 --> 3:13:14.320
 Labels suck, for sure.

3:13:14.320 --> 3:13:19.320
 But you have a spicy way about you on Twitter.

3:13:19.680 --> 3:13:21.600
 Even in this conversation, you know,

3:13:21.600 --> 3:13:25.960
 you had some good, strong words to say about movement.

3:13:25.960 --> 3:13:29.460
 I've always believed life is too short to mince words.

3:13:29.460 --> 3:13:32.720
 One day I'm gonna be dead, and on my deathbed

3:13:32.720 --> 3:13:35.140
 I'm not gonna look back and say,

3:13:35.140 --> 3:13:38.000
 I wish I was a little bit more circumspect

3:13:38.000 --> 3:13:39.160
 in expressing my opinions.

3:13:39.160 --> 3:13:40.900
 I'm far more likely to think, you know what,

3:13:40.900 --> 3:13:43.400
 I wish I said what I really think.

3:13:44.360 --> 3:13:47.560
 Yes, life is too short to hold back your opinion.

3:13:47.560 --> 3:13:50.480
 The question is, what is really your opinion?

3:13:50.480 --> 3:13:55.320
 Because you're many people in one.

3:13:55.320 --> 3:13:56.760
 So there's a person that loves,

3:13:56.760 --> 3:13:58.360
 there's kindness for the human beings,

3:13:58.360 --> 3:14:00.120
 there's a person that gets annoyed,

3:14:00.120 --> 3:14:03.200
 there's a person that enjoys disagreement,

3:14:03.200 --> 3:14:05.720
 there's a person that enjoys collaboration.

3:14:05.720 --> 3:14:07.900
 And you can emphasize all of those different things,

3:14:07.900 --> 3:14:09.360
 each of those different things,

3:14:09.360 --> 3:14:12.240
 weigh it differently in your online interaction.

3:14:12.240 --> 3:14:15.120
 There's some aspects of online interaction

3:14:15.120 --> 3:14:18.080
 that encourages, in different communities,

3:14:18.080 --> 3:14:20.560
 online interaction is one community

3:14:20.560 --> 3:14:24.520
 that encourages kind of derision and mockery and so on.

3:14:24.520 --> 3:14:26.800
 So you can choose if you want to engage

3:14:26.800 --> 3:14:29.280
 that part of yourself or some other part of yourself.

3:14:29.280 --> 3:14:33.360
 Economics is another community that enjoys

3:14:34.280 --> 3:14:36.520
 being like very straightforward

3:14:36.520 --> 3:14:38.980
 about their disagreements, pretty harsh.

3:14:38.980 --> 3:14:41.880
 It's fun to watch because it feels like you arrive

3:14:41.880 --> 3:14:44.940
 at the truth much faster because you tear each other apart.

3:14:45.960 --> 3:14:49.760
 But that's a choice, that's a deliberate choice.

3:14:49.760 --> 3:14:53.700
 And I don't want to label an entire community of people

3:14:53.700 --> 3:14:56.480
 by its extremes, I don't think you should do that.

3:14:56.480 --> 3:14:59.160
 But there's cultural characteristics you start to notice

3:14:59.160 --> 3:15:00.800
 when you go to France, it's a certain way.

3:15:00.800 --> 3:15:04.160
 When you go to Britain, London is different than rural.

3:15:04.160 --> 3:15:08.140
 Britain and New York is different than Iowa.

3:15:08.140 --> 3:15:09.200
 You start to notice things.

3:15:09.200 --> 3:15:10.600
 I mean, you don't want to generalize,

3:15:10.600 --> 3:15:12.020
 there's all kinds of people everywhere,

3:15:12.020 --> 3:15:15.080
 but there's a certain way of communication

3:15:15.080 --> 3:15:16.780
 on crypto, Twitter in general,

3:15:16.780 --> 3:15:19.280
 but also Bitcoin maximalists

3:15:19.280 --> 3:15:21.920
 that I even early on received a bunch of heat.

3:15:21.920 --> 3:15:24.080
 I was like, what the hell?

3:15:24.080 --> 3:15:27.040
 So listen, there's definitely a difference

3:15:27.040 --> 3:15:29.460
 when I go to the computer science community,

3:15:29.460 --> 3:15:31.340
 the machine learning community,

3:15:31.340 --> 3:15:35.020
 it's way friendlier than the cryptocurrency community.

3:15:35.020 --> 3:15:39.940
 I have much more freedom to actually be what I enjoy being,

3:15:39.940 --> 3:15:42.680
 which is asking simple dumb questions.

3:15:42.680 --> 3:15:44.880
 Even when I've already spent years,

3:15:44.880 --> 3:15:46.280
 sometimes decades with an idea,

3:15:46.280 --> 3:15:48.960
 I like asking dumb questions anyway.

3:15:48.960 --> 3:15:52.000
 The crypto folks punish you for this,

3:15:52.000 --> 3:15:56.400
 for curiosity, for exploration.

3:15:56.400 --> 3:15:57.760
 I understand the mechanism

3:15:57.760 --> 3:16:00.900
 because so many other people come into that community

3:16:00.900 --> 3:16:04.240
 and they might masquerade as curious,

3:16:04.240 --> 3:16:06.440
 but really they're trying to inject,

3:16:06.440 --> 3:16:08.080
 they're trying to sell some kind of altcoin,

3:16:08.080 --> 3:16:10.920
 there's some scheme, there's some scheme to make money.

3:16:10.920 --> 3:16:12.480
 And so I understand,

3:16:12.480 --> 3:16:14.920
 maybe that's just the dynamics of the community by nature.

3:16:14.920 --> 3:16:18.200
 It's not like you respond appropriately

3:16:18.200 --> 3:16:22.240
 to the amount of charlatans in the community.

3:16:22.240 --> 3:16:25.320
 So if the fraction of charlatans is low,

3:16:25.320 --> 3:16:27.960
 maybe you can afford to be more loving and kind and so on.

3:16:27.960 --> 3:16:30.840
 And when the fraction of charlatans is high,

3:16:30.840 --> 3:16:32.720
 you have to be harsher.

3:16:32.720 --> 3:16:34.560
 Perhaps, perhaps.

3:16:34.560 --> 3:16:37.400
 But I think also the stakes are extremely high

3:16:37.400 --> 3:16:38.240
 in this situation.

3:16:38.240 --> 3:16:40.320
 And I think if you don't like Bitcoiners,

3:16:40.320 --> 3:16:41.800
 if you think Bitcoiners are toxic,

3:16:41.800 --> 3:16:43.280
 wait till you meet fiaters.

3:16:44.440 --> 3:16:49.120
 The fiat community has financed world wars and genocides

3:16:49.120 --> 3:16:53.920
 and tyrants and the mass death and destruction.

3:16:53.920 --> 3:16:56.560
 The fiat community, if you wanna use that term,

3:16:56.560 --> 3:16:57.800
 I don't believe that you should,

3:16:57.800 --> 3:17:00.960
 but I mean, fiat has destroyed the savings

3:17:00.960 --> 3:17:02.480
 of pretty much anybody who's lived

3:17:02.480 --> 3:17:03.880
 through the last 20th century.

3:17:03.880 --> 3:17:05.760
 Pretty much anybody who's lived through the 20th century,

3:17:05.760 --> 3:17:07.000
 no matter where you lived,

3:17:07.000 --> 3:17:09.920
 Switzerland, US, Ethiopia, Russia,

3:17:09.920 --> 3:17:12.480
 you've gone through fiat problems.

3:17:12.480 --> 3:17:15.520
 You've had hyperinflation, you've had bank confiscation.

3:17:15.520 --> 3:17:17.320
 There isn't a family in the world today

3:17:17.320 --> 3:17:21.320
 that hasn't had its wealth destroyed over the last century.

3:17:21.320 --> 3:17:24.440
 They all have a story about the inflation

3:17:24.440 --> 3:17:25.840
 and the hyperinflation.

3:17:25.840 --> 3:17:27.720
 And Bitcoin offers us a way out of this.

3:17:27.720 --> 3:17:32.720
 And shitcoins, altcoins are essentially fiat world's

3:17:34.920 --> 3:17:39.240
 last gasp attempt to try and salvage fiat,

3:17:39.240 --> 3:17:41.400
 to try and salvage the idea that some people

3:17:41.400 --> 3:17:43.520
 will continue to be able to print money

3:17:43.520 --> 3:17:46.200
 and other people will have to use that money.

3:17:46.200 --> 3:17:49.000
 You know, this is Twitter, it's a free market,

3:17:49.000 --> 3:17:50.240
 it's the internet.

3:17:50.240 --> 3:17:52.560
 You don't have to follow anybody, that's the thing.

3:17:52.560 --> 3:17:57.440
 So what I find really objectionable about the people

3:17:57.440 --> 3:18:00.440
 who are so butthurt always about Bitcoin maximalists

3:18:00.440 --> 3:18:04.120
 is you don't have to click follow on people you don't like.

3:18:04.120 --> 3:18:06.680
 There are 300 million Twitter accounts.

3:18:06.680 --> 3:18:09.400
 And if you choose to follow the accounts

3:18:09.400 --> 3:18:11.200
 that say things that annoy you

3:18:11.200 --> 3:18:12.640
 and then complain about the fact

3:18:12.640 --> 3:18:15.320
 that they say things that annoy you,

3:18:15.320 --> 3:18:16.480
 I'm sorry, but you're an idiot

3:18:16.480 --> 3:18:18.280
 that you don't know how to use Twitter.

3:18:18.280 --> 3:18:20.360
 Just follow the accounts that you like.

3:18:20.360 --> 3:18:24.000
 It's, you know, you don't have to be part of this.

3:18:24.000 --> 3:18:25.280
 You don't have to listen to those people.

3:18:25.280 --> 3:18:27.120
 You can choose, there are a lot of Bitcoiners

3:18:27.120 --> 3:18:28.200
 that don't act like this.

3:18:28.200 --> 3:18:30.360
 You can just unfollow the ones that you don't like.

3:18:30.360 --> 3:18:33.800
 Since in the past year, man, time flies.

3:18:33.800 --> 3:18:36.320
 I've met a lot of them and I enjoy them a lot.

3:18:36.320 --> 3:18:38.400
 And you build that community of people that you enjoy.

3:18:38.400 --> 3:18:40.680
 There are less that communicate in the way you enjoy.

3:18:40.680 --> 3:18:42.600
 And it's becoming me at this point

3:18:42.600 --> 3:18:44.760
 that I block with love, I think.

3:18:44.760 --> 3:18:45.600
 Yes.

3:18:45.600 --> 3:18:47.080
 Because I did not.

3:18:47.080 --> 3:18:48.600
 I block very prolifically

3:18:48.600 --> 3:18:51.160
 and I strongly recommend people continue to block.

3:18:51.160 --> 3:18:52.480
 I think Twitter is, you know,

3:18:52.480 --> 3:18:53.760
 you're not gonna get to interact

3:18:53.760 --> 3:18:55.440
 with 300 million accounts anyway.

3:18:55.440 --> 3:18:58.480
 So you wanna be constantly curating the experience

3:18:58.480 --> 3:19:00.440
 by getting rid of people you don't like

3:19:00.440 --> 3:19:02.360
 and following people that you like.

3:19:02.360 --> 3:19:03.880
 And that's just how, you know,

3:19:03.880 --> 3:19:05.440
 after 10 years of using Twitter,

3:19:05.440 --> 3:19:08.040
 you know, you get, you accumulate the block list,

3:19:08.040 --> 3:19:09.840
 which is very big, which I'm very happy for.

3:19:09.840 --> 3:19:11.480
 I'm gonna pass on to my children.

3:19:11.480 --> 3:19:15.760
 That's, on your deathbed,

3:19:15.760 --> 3:19:17.640
 the grandchildren will gather around

3:19:17.640 --> 3:19:22.560
 and your grandfather can finally share the full list.

3:19:22.560 --> 3:19:23.400
 Yeah.

3:19:23.400 --> 3:19:25.320
 So like, again, it's just a Twitter account.

3:19:25.320 --> 3:19:28.640
 If it bothers you so much, ask yourself why it bothers you

3:19:28.640 --> 3:19:29.920
 that some people are so,

3:19:29.920 --> 3:19:31.640
 I'm not referring to you obviously,

3:19:31.640 --> 3:19:34.280
 but I mean, the people that are constantly aggravated

3:19:34.280 --> 3:19:36.560
 about this, I don't get bothered by anything on Twitter.

3:19:36.560 --> 3:19:38.240
 I just block immediately.

3:19:38.240 --> 3:19:40.960
 And I get to curate the experience that I enjoy.

3:19:40.960 --> 3:19:43.240
 And I recommend people do that.

3:19:43.240 --> 3:19:46.280
 It's really a lot less pathetic than complaining

3:19:46.280 --> 3:19:48.000
 about strangers saying things you don't like,

3:19:48.000 --> 3:19:51.480
 which a lot of, and of course the reason for it is,

3:19:51.480 --> 3:19:53.960
 you know, I mean, when I say it's stupid,

3:19:53.960 --> 3:19:55.000
 it's not really stupid.

3:19:55.000 --> 3:19:56.320
 There's an ulterior motive there.

3:19:56.320 --> 3:19:58.000
 And the ulterior motive is,

3:19:58.000 --> 3:19:59.840
 hey, I have this shit coin that I made

3:19:59.840 --> 3:20:01.640
 with five other friends of mine.

3:20:01.640 --> 3:20:02.920
 And I'd like you to,

3:20:02.920 --> 3:20:05.280
 I'd like to ride your coattails, Bitcoiners,

3:20:05.280 --> 3:20:07.480
 and I'd like you to please help me promote this shit coin.

3:20:07.480 --> 3:20:10.280
 Like this is, I get this practically every week,

3:20:10.280 --> 3:20:12.520
 whether through email or through Twitter,

3:20:12.520 --> 3:20:14.920
 where, hey, you know, this is our shit coin.

3:20:15.880 --> 3:20:17.440
 You know, it's just like Bitcoin,

3:20:17.440 --> 3:20:19.520
 but it's better because it does this and this and that.

3:20:19.520 --> 3:20:22.520
 And, you know, basically how can we get you

3:20:22.520 --> 3:20:24.600
 to promote this shit coin for us?

3:20:24.600 --> 3:20:27.360
 And being straightforward and forthright

3:20:27.360 --> 3:20:29.800
 is a great productivity hack,

3:20:29.800 --> 3:20:32.200
 because, you know, you just tell those people,

3:20:32.200 --> 3:20:33.200
 no, I'm not interested.

3:20:33.200 --> 3:20:34.040
 It's a stupid shit coin.

3:20:34.040 --> 3:20:36.160
 And I wish you quick and swift failure

3:20:36.160 --> 3:20:38.640
 before you take a lot of people's money.

3:20:39.640 --> 3:20:41.760
 And that's what I genuinely think.

3:20:41.760 --> 3:20:44.240
 Well, but I'll just be upfront with the fact,

3:20:44.240 --> 3:20:45.600
 at least for my taste,

3:20:45.600 --> 3:20:50.600
 just labeling everything as a shit coin worries me.

3:20:50.880 --> 3:20:52.120
 So this is my own preference.

3:20:52.120 --> 3:20:53.400
 It's not a judgment on you.

3:20:53.400 --> 3:20:54.840
 It's just my own preference

3:20:54.840 --> 3:20:57.840
 that I'm afraid I'll miss good ideas.

3:20:57.840 --> 3:20:59.440
 I think when you're, me personally,

3:20:59.440 --> 3:21:01.600
 when I'm too certain about things,

3:21:01.600 --> 3:21:03.800
 when I'm too tribal about things,

3:21:03.800 --> 3:21:06.640
 I'll miss actually really strong ideas,

3:21:06.640 --> 3:21:09.360
 outlier ideas, totally new ideas.

3:21:09.360 --> 3:21:10.880
 So that worries me.

3:21:10.880 --> 3:21:15.880
 One of the downsides of the way Bitcoin is,

3:21:16.120 --> 3:21:18.560
 how much shit is at stake financially

3:21:18.560 --> 3:21:20.480
 is that it's less open to good,

3:21:20.480 --> 3:21:23.560
 and actually by design, that it's not changing,

3:21:23.560 --> 3:21:25.440
 like with the hard forks and so on,

3:21:25.440 --> 3:21:28.040
 that there's not a kind of curiosity

3:21:28.040 --> 3:21:29.880
 about exploration of ideas.

3:21:30.920 --> 3:21:33.120
 Of course, in some way,

3:21:33.120 --> 3:21:35.640
 that curiosity can start getting injected

3:21:35.640 --> 3:21:37.480
 when you start talking about other layers

3:21:37.480 --> 3:21:39.360
 built on top of Bitcoin,

3:21:39.360 --> 3:21:40.920
 when you start talking about applications

3:21:40.920 --> 3:21:43.320
 or different things like lightning network,

3:21:43.320 --> 3:21:45.520
 that's where the curiosity can emerge.

3:21:45.520 --> 3:21:48.080
 But still, that's why with cryptocurrency in general,

3:21:48.080 --> 3:21:49.440
 I just try to keep an open mind.

3:21:49.440 --> 3:21:52.440
 And just the shit coin as a term

3:21:52.440 --> 3:21:53.520
 is just a good statement

3:21:53.520 --> 3:21:54.920
 that I'm gonna close my mind to.

3:21:54.920 --> 3:21:56.160
 That's the way I hear it.

3:21:57.560 --> 3:21:59.360
 But coming out of your mouth,

3:21:59.360 --> 3:22:01.080
 because you say a lot of other edgy stuff,

3:22:01.080 --> 3:22:02.960
 it's just more you having fun.

3:22:02.960 --> 3:22:03.800
 That's the way I hear it.

3:22:03.800 --> 3:22:05.320
 But if I said something like that,

3:22:05.320 --> 3:22:08.440
 I would feel like I'm closing my mind.

3:22:08.440 --> 3:22:10.640
 I mean, let me give you the counter argument to that.

3:22:10.640 --> 3:22:13.080
 How much time do you spend emailing back

3:22:13.080 --> 3:22:15.520
 all of these Nigerian Prince email scams

3:22:15.520 --> 3:22:16.760
 that you know email you tell you,

3:22:16.760 --> 3:22:19.880
 send me $5,000 and I'll send you $15 million?

3:22:19.880 --> 3:22:21.280
 None. None.

3:22:21.280 --> 3:22:22.840
 Why are you being close minded

3:22:22.840 --> 3:22:23.920
 to all of these great ideas?

3:22:23.920 --> 3:22:25.920
 Well, no, but I'm also...

3:22:25.920 --> 3:22:26.840
 You know, maybe one of them

3:22:26.840 --> 3:22:28.440
 will actually send you $15 million.

3:22:28.440 --> 3:22:29.880
 But I don't know if I know the difference

3:22:29.880 --> 3:22:32.040
 between the Nigerian Prince

3:22:32.040 --> 3:22:34.160
 and many other people I do talk to

3:22:34.160 --> 3:22:35.680
 who are colleagues and so on

3:22:35.680 --> 3:22:37.400
 that are also emailing me.

3:22:37.400 --> 3:22:39.840
 And they're also offering me things,

3:22:39.840 --> 3:22:42.360
 but they don't sound as ridiculously spammy.

3:22:42.360 --> 3:22:44.120
 Yeah, but I mean, the moment that somebody tells you,

3:22:44.120 --> 3:22:46.520
 hey, I'm gonna give you $15 million for nothing,

3:22:46.520 --> 3:22:48.520
 just if you send me $5,000,

3:22:48.520 --> 3:22:49.960
 you know, you're getting something for nothing.

3:22:49.960 --> 3:22:53.080
 And essentially, with all of the digital currencies,

3:22:53.080 --> 3:22:53.920
 it's the same pitch.

3:22:53.920 --> 3:22:56.520
 Say, hey, you know, come use this thing

3:22:56.520 --> 3:22:58.240
 that'll allow you to do things that...

3:22:58.240 --> 3:23:00.400
 All of the things that they pretend that they can do

3:23:00.400 --> 3:23:01.880
 that can be done with computers

3:23:01.880 --> 3:23:03.280
 without having digital currencies.

3:23:03.280 --> 3:23:06.440
 You know, we already have AWS that does cloud computing,

3:23:06.440 --> 3:23:09.600
 that does everything that shitcoins pretend to do.

3:23:09.600 --> 3:23:11.360
 The only difference is AWS doesn't have

3:23:11.360 --> 3:23:13.440
 its own monetary system tacked on top of it

3:23:13.440 --> 3:23:17.520
 to allow Jeff Bezos to basically print his own money.

3:23:17.520 --> 3:23:19.560
 But don't you think there's some gray area?

3:23:19.560 --> 3:23:22.160
 So let me go for the historical record

3:23:22.160 --> 3:23:23.600
 and let's see if you've changed

3:23:23.600 --> 3:23:27.720
 as a philosopher, economist, human being.

3:23:27.720 --> 3:23:29.640
 You tweeted three years ago.

3:23:29.640 --> 3:23:30.760
 Oh, well.

3:23:30.760 --> 3:23:33.040
 Anyone who believes proof of stake in work

3:23:33.040 --> 3:23:35.840
 is either one completely clueless

3:23:35.840 --> 3:23:38.120
 at how and why Bitcoin works at all

3:23:38.120 --> 3:23:41.600
 or two, a con artist using it as a buzzword

3:23:41.600 --> 3:23:44.720
 to promote a worthless scam like Ethereum.

3:23:44.720 --> 3:23:49.720
 Do you still believe that Ethereum is a scam

3:23:50.080 --> 3:23:51.680
 and in general, proof of stake?

3:23:51.680 --> 3:23:55.280
 You're either clueless if you think it's interesting.

3:23:55.280 --> 3:23:57.320
 Yeah, no, I still stand by that.

3:23:57.320 --> 3:23:58.160
 I think the...

3:23:58.160 --> 3:24:00.240
 Would you classify Ethereum as a shitcoin?

3:24:00.240 --> 3:24:01.080
 For sure.

3:24:01.080 --> 3:24:05.520
 It's the mother asshole from which the shitcoins spring.

3:24:05.520 --> 3:24:07.200
 The royal, the king shitcoin.

3:24:07.200 --> 3:24:08.040
 Yeah.

3:24:08.040 --> 3:24:09.920
 I think the key thing is,

3:24:09.920 --> 3:24:11.400
 the way to think about there's another tweet

3:24:11.400 --> 3:24:12.360
 from a couple of years ago,

3:24:12.360 --> 3:24:14.600
 which is essentially proof of work

3:24:14.600 --> 3:24:16.320
 was like the invention of flight.

3:24:16.320 --> 3:24:17.400
 Like we've gotten this machine

3:24:17.400 --> 3:24:19.920
 and we managed to get it to fly off the ground.

3:24:19.920 --> 3:24:21.440
 And proof of stake is,

3:24:21.440 --> 3:24:25.320
 hey, we found a great way to make airplanes cheaper

3:24:25.320 --> 3:24:27.920
 and faster by not making them fly.

3:24:30.040 --> 3:24:31.640
 By keeping them on the ground.

3:24:31.640 --> 3:24:34.040
 Like the invention of proof of work,

3:24:34.040 --> 3:24:38.080
 the reason the entire digital currency space exists

3:24:38.080 --> 3:24:40.880
 is because Bitcoin operates based on proof of work.

3:24:40.880 --> 3:24:43.040
 If Bitcoin was based on proof of stake,

3:24:43.040 --> 3:24:45.680
 it would have died or been shut down from day one.

3:24:45.680 --> 3:24:49.280
 But that's a hypothesis and a lot of people believe that

3:24:49.280 --> 3:24:51.360
 and I think they have a lot of strong support.

3:24:51.360 --> 3:24:55.960
 But basically, proof of work is grounded in physics

3:24:55.960 --> 3:24:56.880
 in the real world.

3:24:56.880 --> 3:24:58.960
 The proof of stake is more about...

3:24:58.960 --> 3:24:59.800
 It's politics.

3:24:59.800 --> 3:25:00.880
 It's the Federal Reserve.

3:25:00.880 --> 3:25:02.280
 It's exactly what we have.

3:25:02.280 --> 3:25:03.520
 It's exactly what we have.

3:25:03.520 --> 3:25:06.920
 It's just a group of people who get to decide the rules.

3:25:06.920 --> 3:25:09.800
 And it's essentially a system that is,

3:25:09.800 --> 3:25:11.120
 it's a security, it's a company.

3:25:11.120 --> 3:25:13.680
 So it's not an innovation in any sense.

3:25:13.680 --> 3:25:16.000
 It's a step backwards to what we already had,

3:25:16.000 --> 3:25:18.640
 which is you get a bunch of people in charge of the money.

3:25:18.640 --> 3:25:22.680
 Now, the only reason it survives in this,

3:25:22.680 --> 3:25:24.440
 the reason I call these things scam

3:25:24.440 --> 3:25:25.880
 and I have no problem with calling them a scam

3:25:25.880 --> 3:25:29.520
 is because they fraudulently present themselves

3:25:29.520 --> 3:25:31.120
 as being decentralized.

3:25:31.120 --> 3:25:33.240
 They present themselves as just being a different way

3:25:33.240 --> 3:25:36.600
 of doing decentralization than Bitcoin, when it's not.

3:25:36.600 --> 3:25:39.160
 It's just they're writing Bitcoin's coattails

3:25:39.160 --> 3:25:40.920
 and they're writing the fact that most people

3:25:40.920 --> 3:25:43.480
 don't quite understand what Bitcoin is and how it works

3:25:43.480 --> 3:25:45.600
 to portray themselves as a cheaper, better,

3:25:45.600 --> 3:25:48.400
 more efficient way of doing what Bitcoin does.

3:25:48.400 --> 3:25:49.320
 It's not.

3:25:49.320 --> 3:25:52.680
 It's a less legally accountable way

3:25:52.680 --> 3:25:54.920
 of doing what central banks do.

3:25:54.920 --> 3:25:56.920
 Right, so and the basic criticism is that

3:25:56.920 --> 3:25:58.120
 there's a group of people,

3:25:58.120 --> 3:25:59.720
 sometimes a very small group of people

3:25:59.720 --> 3:26:01.800
 that can control the parameters

3:26:01.800 --> 3:26:03.360
 of the operation of the system.

3:26:03.360 --> 3:26:06.840
 So over time, you can't trust,

3:26:06.840 --> 3:26:09.120
 it's not gold under the mattress.

3:26:09.120 --> 3:26:10.600
 It doesn't have that kind of heart.

3:26:10.600 --> 3:26:11.440
 It's not property.

3:26:11.440 --> 3:26:14.000
 And I really very strongly recommend your discussion

3:26:14.000 --> 3:26:16.480
 with Saylor for people who want to elaborate more on this.

3:26:16.480 --> 3:26:17.800
 There's a bunch of people in charge,

3:26:17.800 --> 3:26:20.160
 which means that legally,

3:26:20.160 --> 3:26:23.040
 they should be doing this under securities law.

3:26:23.040 --> 3:26:24.480
 But even as an anarchist,

3:26:24.480 --> 3:26:26.320
 if I don't want to care about that,

3:26:26.320 --> 3:26:28.640
 the technical implication of it is,

3:26:28.640 --> 3:26:30.200
 this is never going to be adopted

3:26:30.200 --> 3:26:33.080
 as a neutral way of transferring value on the internet

3:26:33.080 --> 3:26:35.440
 because you need something

3:26:35.440 --> 3:26:37.440
 that enemies can trade with one another.

3:26:37.440 --> 3:26:38.440
 You can't have something

3:26:38.440 --> 3:26:40.360
 that has a small group of people in charge

3:26:40.360 --> 3:26:43.000
 because A, this small group of people themselves

3:26:43.000 --> 3:26:47.200
 can be corrupted and B, they can be coerced.

3:26:47.200 --> 3:26:49.120
 You can put a bunch of people in a room,

3:26:49.120 --> 3:26:50.120
 put a gun to their head,

3:26:50.120 --> 3:26:52.560
 and you can change everything

3:26:52.560 --> 3:26:53.960
 in any of these digital currencies.

3:26:53.960 --> 3:26:58.240
 And that's why I think you'll find a lot more sympathy

3:26:58.240 --> 3:27:01.480
 among fiaters to shitcoins.

3:27:01.480 --> 3:27:05.560
 The Keynesian economist to Ethereum fanboy pipeline

3:27:05.560 --> 3:27:09.920
 is a very strong one because it's the same thing.

3:27:09.920 --> 3:27:11.400
 It's like you like the idea

3:27:11.400 --> 3:27:13.080
 of people being in charge of money

3:27:13.080 --> 3:27:14.440
 and you think you're going to be the one

3:27:14.440 --> 3:27:15.600
 who's going to be in charge of money.

3:27:15.600 --> 3:27:18.080
 So you see a lot of this phenomenon

3:27:18.080 --> 3:27:20.480
 and you see the same people that want gold

3:27:20.480 --> 3:27:23.680
 and don't like central banking, they get into Bitcoin.

3:27:23.680 --> 3:27:27.520
 Yeah, so just to actually push back on a couple of things.

3:27:27.520 --> 3:27:29.800
 So one is theater.

3:27:29.800 --> 3:27:32.800
 It sounds like I'm trying to be a sophisticated Brit

3:27:32.800 --> 3:27:34.200
 talking about theater,

3:27:34.200 --> 3:27:38.800
 but for many reasons not making me feel good about that.

3:27:38.800 --> 3:27:42.040
 So day by day, things change.

3:27:42.040 --> 3:27:44.600
 You used to be one of those.

3:27:44.600 --> 3:27:46.760
 So people evolve, people learn.

3:27:46.760 --> 3:27:48.160
 People that are supporters of Bitcoin

3:27:48.160 --> 3:27:51.920
 might eventually become supporters of Ethereum

3:27:51.920 --> 3:27:53.600
 or go back to supporting fiat.

3:27:53.600 --> 3:27:54.440
 We don't know.

3:27:54.440 --> 3:27:56.440
 People evolve for different reasons.

3:27:56.440 --> 3:28:00.520
 You grow up, you mature, or you become enlightened.

3:28:00.520 --> 3:28:03.840
 So I think every single person sort of,

3:28:03.840 --> 3:28:07.560
 as this technology is evolving, as this world is evolving,

3:28:07.560 --> 3:28:10.280
 as wars break on, as your politics change,

3:28:10.280 --> 3:28:14.160
 as the monetary system is constantly put under stress,

3:28:14.160 --> 3:28:15.080
 people will evolve.

3:28:15.080 --> 3:28:17.400
 So we're trying to all figure it out together.

3:28:17.400 --> 3:28:19.080
 That's why like open mindedness here,

3:28:19.080 --> 3:28:23.120
 I think for people like me at least seems essential.

3:28:23.120 --> 3:28:25.440
 I know, so I expect you to be answering

3:28:25.440 --> 3:28:27.600
 all of the spam emails you get.

3:28:27.600 --> 3:28:29.640
 I will, prince by prince by prince.

3:28:29.640 --> 3:28:32.880
 But no, I don't have a clear understanding

3:28:32.880 --> 3:28:34.200
 what is a good investment in my time,

3:28:34.200 --> 3:28:36.000
 what is a good investment in my money.

3:28:36.000 --> 3:28:38.860
 That doesn't seem clear because things,

3:28:40.440 --> 3:28:42.120
 things are good at promoting themselves.

3:28:42.120 --> 3:28:45.300
 I'm not talking about the different kinds of things

3:28:45.300 --> 3:28:47.360
 like Ethereum, altcoins, and so on.

3:28:47.360 --> 3:28:52.360
 I just mean life, like dating, jobs, friendships.

3:28:52.360 --> 3:28:56.900
 Like everybody's advertising themselves

3:28:56.900 --> 3:28:59.340
 as a great investment, right?

3:28:59.340 --> 3:29:02.040
 But you don't know and you have to keep an open mind.

3:29:02.040 --> 3:29:06.860
 And also I don't, and be sort of self introspective

3:29:06.860 --> 3:29:11.860
 about what, how like biases I operate under

3:29:12.260 --> 3:29:14.860
 and ways I delude myself,

3:29:14.860 --> 3:29:16.800
 like hallucinations that I'm living under.

3:29:16.800 --> 3:29:19.880
 It's like breaking out of all these hallucinations.

3:29:19.880 --> 3:29:22.900
 It's very hard to introspect thinking like

3:29:22.900 --> 3:29:25.900
 what are the assumptions under which I live my entire life

3:29:25.900 --> 3:29:27.900
 that might be actually false assumptions.

3:29:27.900 --> 3:29:31.060
 That's a really difficult thought process to take.

3:29:31.060 --> 3:29:32.500
 It's a dangerous one.

3:29:32.500 --> 3:29:35.300
 It's the nature if you gaze long into the abyss,

3:29:35.300 --> 3:29:37.260
 the abyss gaze into you.

3:29:37.260 --> 3:29:40.060
 It's like Alex Jones talks about this.

3:29:40.060 --> 3:29:43.660
 I mean he's living, he's got demons in his head.

3:29:43.660 --> 3:29:45.780
 So he has like all these conspiracy theories

3:29:45.780 --> 3:29:46.700
 that it holds in his head

3:29:46.700 --> 3:29:48.820
 but it begins to really destroy him.

3:29:48.820 --> 3:29:51.140
 So it's a psychological burden to carry.

3:29:51.140 --> 3:29:53.420
 So if you question, if you question authority,

3:29:53.420 --> 3:29:55.940
 if you question government, if you question culture,

3:29:55.940 --> 3:29:58.540
 the way things have been done, it's really difficult.

3:29:59.880 --> 3:30:02.340
 And the biases you operate under,

3:30:02.340 --> 3:30:03.740
 it's really difficult to question them.

3:30:03.740 --> 3:30:07.620
 So I think like being constantly open minded

3:30:07.620 --> 3:30:10.060
 and self critical, not constantly,

3:30:10.060 --> 3:30:12.780
 but a little bit every day is important I think.

3:30:12.780 --> 3:30:15.180
 Yeah, but I mean, you know, you're talking to somebody,

3:30:15.180 --> 3:30:18.700
 I grew up in Ramallah in Palestine in the West Bank.

3:30:18.700 --> 3:30:22.260
 I've changed my mind on all kinds of different things.

3:30:22.260 --> 3:30:25.260
 The fact that I was even open to the idea of Bitcoin

3:30:25.260 --> 3:30:29.180
 is required, has required an enormous, enormous amount of,

3:30:29.180 --> 3:30:30.180
 it's a heck of a journey.

3:30:30.180 --> 3:30:34.740
 So I'd much rather appreciate, you know, direct arguments

3:30:34.740 --> 3:30:37.580
 rather than these kinds of general fluffy,

3:30:37.580 --> 3:30:39.140
 you know, you should be, oh, of course, yes,

3:30:39.140 --> 3:30:40.060
 you should be open minded,

3:30:40.060 --> 3:30:42.620
 but you know, also you come up with conclusions

3:30:42.620 --> 3:30:44.260
 and you delete spam email sometimes

3:30:44.260 --> 3:30:45.380
 when you know that it is spam

3:30:45.380 --> 3:30:46.740
 because you have to move on with your life.

3:30:46.740 --> 3:30:48.380
 You can't, there's an opportunity cost

3:30:48.380 --> 3:30:50.140
 to considering every spam email, so.

3:30:50.140 --> 3:30:52.340
 Well, to me, okay, so I'll just say

3:30:52.340 --> 3:30:56.980
 from my relatively sort of shallow perspective,

3:30:56.980 --> 3:30:59.300
 almost like a technical person, mostly,

3:30:59.300 --> 3:31:01.280
 my understanding of economics is weak.

3:31:02.700 --> 3:31:05.100
 Proof of stake is not obviously

3:31:07.620 --> 3:31:10.960
 a weak consensus mechanism relative to proof of work.

3:31:10.960 --> 3:31:14.880
 So that's not obvious to me that that goes wrong

3:31:14.880 --> 3:31:16.440
 and becomes corrupted in the way

3:31:16.440 --> 3:31:18.160
 that governments get corrupted

3:31:18.160 --> 3:31:21.680
 because it still seems decentralized.

3:31:21.680 --> 3:31:24.800
 Now, your criticism of governance is an interesting one,

3:31:24.800 --> 3:31:26.680
 but if you put that aside,

3:31:26.680 --> 3:31:29.280
 it still is a decentralized mechanism

3:31:29.280 --> 3:31:32.680
 and it's more transparent than the mechanism

3:31:32.680 --> 3:31:33.800
 that governments operate on.

3:31:33.800 --> 3:31:35.800
 It isn't, it's exactly what the Federal Reserve is.

3:31:35.800 --> 3:31:37.680
 The Federal Reserve is a proof of stake system.

3:31:37.680 --> 3:31:40.680
 The Federal Reserve is owned by its constituent banks

3:31:40.680 --> 3:31:42.400
 and so the rules of the Federal Reserve

3:31:42.400 --> 3:31:44.800
 and the regulations are determined by the ownership,

3:31:44.800 --> 3:31:45.640
 which is the banks.

3:31:45.640 --> 3:31:47.800
 So it's exactly what the Federal Reserve is.

3:31:47.800 --> 3:31:50.520
 But it's too backdoor, the agreements

3:31:50.520 --> 3:31:53.760
 between the banks and the Federal Reserve.

3:31:53.760 --> 3:31:55.100
 It feels like a lot of those agreements

3:31:55.100 --> 3:31:58.760
 are made between individuals that sort of behind the scenes.

3:31:58.760 --> 3:32:01.160
 It's not hard to, it's opaque.

3:32:01.160 --> 3:32:03.560
 Yes, but the only way that a proof of stake system

3:32:03.560 --> 3:32:05.560
 will take off is if you have a military

3:32:05.560 --> 3:32:07.280
 to force people to use it.

3:32:07.280 --> 3:32:08.120
 That's the thing.

3:32:08.120 --> 3:32:10.360
 Ultimately, there's no way that it's going to take off

3:32:10.360 --> 3:32:11.760
 on a free market.

3:32:11.760 --> 3:32:14.040
 And that's why for all of the bluster

3:32:14.040 --> 3:32:16.280
 about wanting to move to a proof of stake system,

3:32:16.280 --> 3:32:19.080
 Ethereum have been saying this since 2014.

3:32:19.080 --> 3:32:22.860
 It's now been eight years that they've been talking about it.

3:32:22.860 --> 3:32:25.420
 We still haven't seen the proof of stake system

3:32:25.420 --> 3:32:26.440
 operational in the wild.

3:32:26.440 --> 3:32:28.400
 It's vaporware for all practical and intentional.

3:32:28.400 --> 3:32:30.020
 Oh, Cardano's proof of stake.

3:32:30.020 --> 3:32:31.600
 It's potential.

3:32:31.600 --> 3:32:33.600
 I mean, you can do it in a centralized way,

3:32:33.600 --> 3:32:36.760
 but can it survive?

3:32:36.760 --> 3:32:38.840
 Can it last for a long time?

3:32:38.840 --> 3:32:39.660
 I don't think so.

3:32:39.660 --> 3:32:44.280
 I think it can last perhaps initially with marketing,

3:32:44.280 --> 3:32:46.280
 with centralized marketing, you can promote it.

3:32:46.280 --> 3:32:50.520
 But ultimately, user demand,

3:32:50.520 --> 3:32:53.160
 the people that are not interested in speculating

3:32:53.160 --> 3:32:54.440
 because they want to get rich on this,

3:32:54.440 --> 3:32:55.820
 the people that are going to use it,

3:32:55.820 --> 3:32:58.280
 they're going to want to use it because they can trust

3:32:58.280 --> 3:33:00.800
 that it is not going to be messed with.

3:33:00.800 --> 3:33:03.280
 Yes, but there's also applications.

3:33:03.280 --> 3:33:04.600
 That's also a lightning network.

3:33:04.600 --> 3:33:06.360
 But there's applications on top.

3:33:06.360 --> 3:33:09.720
 Well, the reason I'm interested in things like Ethereum

3:33:09.720 --> 3:33:11.800
 is you might think it's ridiculous.

3:33:11.800 --> 3:33:14.840
 I thought it was ridiculous, but NFTs.

3:33:14.840 --> 3:33:18.160
 So you can have NFTs probably on top of Bitcoin,

3:33:18.160 --> 3:33:20.440
 but you don't because there's no marketing on Bitcoin

3:33:20.440 --> 3:33:22.920
 because all of these ideas get promoted

3:33:22.920 --> 3:33:25.400
 on proprietary shitcoins because, yes.

3:33:25.400 --> 3:33:28.760
 But there's the network effects of ideas, of applications.

3:33:28.760 --> 3:33:30.440
 So they just take off for some reason.

3:33:30.440 --> 3:33:33.360
 And human civilization is such that you get excited

3:33:33.360 --> 3:33:35.560
 about stuff and large amounts of people believe a thing

3:33:35.560 --> 3:33:38.120
 and they start to get excited and it actually has impact.

3:33:38.120 --> 3:33:41.520
 Like the fact that NFTs can have an impact on the art world

3:33:41.520 --> 3:33:45.360
 or the world in general is wild to me.

3:33:45.360 --> 3:33:46.600
 But it worked.

3:33:46.600 --> 3:33:47.800
 So the question is.

3:33:47.800 --> 3:33:50.320
 David Rothcall has an impact on the art world.

3:33:50.320 --> 3:33:51.960
 That doesn't say much.

3:33:51.960 --> 3:33:54.080
 Well, I'm saying these ideas have,

3:33:54.080 --> 3:33:56.240
 we're collective intelligent beings

3:33:56.240 --> 3:33:59.840
 and we can believe a thing and that has power.

3:33:59.840 --> 3:34:02.820
 That has led to major wars and all those kinds of things.

3:34:02.820 --> 3:34:07.360
 So it's interesting to me that NFTs took hold.

3:34:07.360 --> 3:34:09.880
 And the question is, is there distributed DApps?

3:34:09.880 --> 3:34:11.480
 Is there distributed apps built on top

3:34:11.480 --> 3:34:13.000
 of different blockchains

3:34:13.000 --> 3:34:14.960
 that might somehow transform the world?

3:34:14.960 --> 3:34:17.760
 You have to kind of keep an open mind to that.

3:34:17.760 --> 3:34:19.440
 Cause right now it's like,

3:34:19.440 --> 3:34:21.320
 it's like I'm the same place with that

3:34:21.320 --> 3:34:23.320
 as I am with like virtual reality.

3:34:23.320 --> 3:34:26.560
 It's like, all right, this seems like a really

3:34:26.560 --> 3:34:29.880
 intellectually promising set of ideas here,

3:34:29.880 --> 3:34:31.600
 but there's something either technically

3:34:31.600 --> 3:34:33.920
 or socially not quite taking hold.

3:34:33.920 --> 3:34:35.520
 Why?

3:34:35.520 --> 3:34:37.440
 And I don't know what the right answer is.

3:34:37.440 --> 3:34:39.820
 So with virtual reality, what's the right answer?

3:34:39.820 --> 3:34:43.940
 Is it just technically the latency is too high

3:34:43.940 --> 3:34:46.560
 or the games are not good enough?

3:34:46.560 --> 3:34:48.560
 Or is it a fundamentally flawed idea

3:34:48.560 --> 3:34:51.240
 that you can live in a virtual world and enjoy it?

3:34:51.240 --> 3:34:54.320
 That the physical world is just orders of magnitude better?

3:34:54.320 --> 3:34:57.720
 Or a two dimensional display is just as good

3:34:57.720 --> 3:34:59.160
 as a three dimensional world?

3:34:59.160 --> 3:35:00.000
 I don't know.

3:35:00.000 --> 3:35:01.240
 Why is virtual reality not taking off?

3:35:01.240 --> 3:35:03.280
 It's been since the 80s, right?

3:35:03.280 --> 3:35:05.120
 I don't have strong opinions on it,

3:35:05.120 --> 3:35:07.720
 on the prospect of the technology.

3:35:07.720 --> 3:35:10.600
 Personally, I don't want to ever imagine myself

3:35:10.600 --> 3:35:12.200
 having something on my eyes.

3:35:12.200 --> 3:35:15.200
 I'd rather just go out into the real world.

3:35:15.200 --> 3:35:17.760
 But I don't have strong opinions on virtual reality.

3:35:17.760 --> 3:35:20.000
 I do have on dApps and NFTs.

3:35:20.000 --> 3:35:22.640
 Yeah, what's your criticism of dApps and NFTs?

3:35:22.640 --> 3:35:23.720
 Is this a distraction?

3:35:23.720 --> 3:35:27.740
 It's a way to sell a flawed technology?

3:35:27.740 --> 3:35:29.600
 The problem with dApps is, I mean,

3:35:29.600 --> 3:35:31.880
 it's just the economics of it makes no sense

3:35:31.880 --> 3:35:34.280
 in the sense that currently,

3:35:35.840 --> 3:35:37.880
 if you wanted to run an application,

3:35:37.880 --> 3:35:40.000
 whatever the application is,

3:35:40.000 --> 3:35:41.720
 you want to run it on AWS,

3:35:41.720 --> 3:35:43.080
 you pay a specific amount of money,

3:35:43.080 --> 3:35:44.860
 you want to run it on your own laptop,

3:35:44.860 --> 3:35:48.320
 you pay a specific amount of money per kilobyte of data.

3:35:48.320 --> 3:35:50.960
 If you wanted to run the same thing on a distributed ledger,

3:35:50.960 --> 3:35:52.280
 where you're distributing the data

3:35:52.280 --> 3:35:54.760
 over thousands of computers worldwide,

3:35:54.760 --> 3:35:56.560
 it's infinitely more expensive.

3:35:56.560 --> 3:36:00.600
 And that's why we haven't seen any of these dApps take off.

3:36:00.600 --> 3:36:03.320
 And that's why I've said this many years ago,

3:36:03.320 --> 3:36:04.880
 the only working application

3:36:04.880 --> 3:36:07.080
 of blockchain technology is Bitcoin.

3:36:07.080 --> 3:36:09.280
 Because with Bitcoin, you know,

3:36:09.280 --> 3:36:11.360
 with a few hundred bytes of data,

3:36:11.360 --> 3:36:12.440
 with a few bytes of data,

3:36:12.440 --> 3:36:17.440
 you could move a billion dollars worth of economic value

3:36:17.740 --> 3:36:21.360
 from here to China and move it safely and reliably.

3:36:21.360 --> 3:36:24.200
 So that power,

3:36:24.200 --> 3:36:27.360
 I can't see it being justified

3:36:27.360 --> 3:36:29.360
 for anything that is not as mission critical,

3:36:29.360 --> 3:36:32.280
 as moving large amounts of value,

3:36:32.280 --> 3:36:34.980
 which require very little amount of information.

3:36:34.980 --> 3:36:36.480
 So when you look at all of the buzzwords

3:36:36.480 --> 3:36:40.400
 that the Ethereum and other altcoin marketing people

3:36:40.400 --> 3:36:43.160
 like to use, and you know,

3:36:43.160 --> 3:36:44.760
 if you want to wonder really why

3:36:44.760 --> 3:36:46.840
 we come to this kind of aggression

3:36:46.840 --> 3:36:48.320
 is because we've heard all of this, you know,

3:36:48.320 --> 3:36:50.960
 I've had all of these hucksters come to me for years,

3:36:50.960 --> 3:36:54.640
 you know, it's been, I've had, you know, people in 2016

3:36:54.640 --> 3:36:59.360
 talk to me about how Ethereum blockchain technology

3:36:59.360 --> 3:37:02.880
 is going to revolutionize real estate deeds in India.

3:37:02.880 --> 3:37:04.100
 I remember this guy,

3:37:05.320 --> 3:37:07.760
 I'm not going to mention his name,

3:37:07.760 --> 3:37:09.600
 but this guy was, you know, 2016,

3:37:09.600 --> 3:37:11.320
 and he sold a lot of shitcoins

3:37:11.320 --> 3:37:13.440
 and he made a lot of money off of shitcoins

3:37:13.440 --> 3:37:15.820
 based on all these silly ideas.

3:37:15.820 --> 3:37:19.040
 We're going to have Blackjack on a distributed ledger.

3:37:19.040 --> 3:37:20.400
 We're going to have Indian real estate

3:37:20.400 --> 3:37:22.200
 on a distributed ledger.

3:37:22.200 --> 3:37:25.080
 And it's just, it's concerned trolling marketing.

3:37:25.080 --> 3:37:28.120
 You know, oh, there's a problem with real estate in India,

3:37:28.120 --> 3:37:32.120
 real estate deeds, blockchain fixes this, buy my shitcoin.

3:37:32.120 --> 3:37:33.920
 And then people buy the shitcoin,

3:37:33.920 --> 3:37:35.760
 Indian real estate isn't fixed,

3:37:35.760 --> 3:37:38.520
 and the guy gets rich and they move on.

3:37:38.520 --> 3:37:42.500
 But I mean, I'm still waiting for a dap to actually emerge.

3:37:42.500 --> 3:37:46.760
 Like, you know, it's, the promise that we keep hearing

3:37:46.760 --> 3:37:49.560
 is something completely world changing,

3:37:49.560 --> 3:37:51.000
 world transforming.

3:37:51.000 --> 3:37:53.240
 And the reality is not one app.

3:37:53.240 --> 3:37:56.160
 Like there's one of my good friends, Jimmy Song,

3:37:56.160 --> 3:37:57.800
 eventually they refused to go ahead with the bet.

3:37:57.800 --> 3:38:00.520
 He wanted to bet with one of the Ethereum people

3:38:00.520 --> 3:38:02.840
 about these daps.

3:38:02.840 --> 3:38:04.320
 You know, the Ethereum people are constantly saying

3:38:04.320 --> 3:38:05.360
 those daps are going to grow

3:38:05.360 --> 3:38:07.480
 and they're going to have so many applications

3:38:07.480 --> 3:38:09.120
 and they're going to have so many ideas.

3:38:09.120 --> 3:38:11.720
 And the reality is all the apps that work

3:38:11.720 --> 3:38:13.080
 are centralized apps, you know?

3:38:13.080 --> 3:38:16.560
 So there is no Uber on the blockchain.

3:38:16.560 --> 3:38:20.400
 There is no Twitter on the blockchain.

3:38:20.400 --> 3:38:21.640
 There is no social media on the blockchain

3:38:21.640 --> 3:38:23.200
 because these are businesses

3:38:23.200 --> 3:38:25.560
 and businesses require a centralized authority

3:38:25.560 --> 3:38:26.800
 to make decisions.

3:38:26.800 --> 3:38:29.160
 You can't have it be decentralized.

3:38:29.160 --> 3:38:30.680
 Listen, you're frustrated,

3:38:30.680 --> 3:38:33.000
 and I could see it over a few years

3:38:33.000 --> 3:38:37.960
 of just having dealt with a humongous influx of charlatans.

3:38:37.960 --> 3:38:39.800
 I wouldn't say frustrated, I'm amused.

3:38:39.800 --> 3:38:43.480
 And it's no, it's water off my back.

3:38:43.480 --> 3:38:45.080
 No, but a man that uses,

3:38:45.080 --> 3:38:47.920
 and a community that uses the word shit coin

3:38:47.920 --> 3:38:50.800
 is a little bit, you call it amusement.

3:38:50.800 --> 3:38:52.560
 And I think amusement is a way

3:38:53.520 --> 3:38:55.880
 to deal with the frustration.

3:38:55.880 --> 3:38:57.680
 It's a channel and you have frustration.

3:38:57.680 --> 3:39:01.680
 Like sometimes when you have to deal with bullshit,

3:39:01.680 --> 3:39:04.240
 the best way is just to laugh at the absurdity of it all.

3:39:04.240 --> 3:39:07.160
 And that's what you mean by amusement.

3:39:07.160 --> 3:39:09.000
 But the fact is like,

3:39:10.320 --> 3:39:13.240
 there's things like artificial intelligence for,

3:39:13.240 --> 3:39:18.240
 what is it, how many decades, seven decades,

3:39:18.400 --> 3:39:23.520
 has been off and on promising to change everything.

3:39:23.520 --> 3:39:28.080
 And it has failed time and time again

3:39:28.080 --> 3:39:30.320
 to deliver to the promise.

3:39:30.320 --> 3:39:32.560
 But that doesn't mean there's something fundamental

3:39:32.560 --> 3:39:34.720
 and really powerful about both the small

3:39:34.720 --> 3:39:36.520
 and the big things going on

3:39:36.520 --> 3:39:39.320
 within the actual research and development

3:39:39.320 --> 3:39:40.360
 within those communities.

3:39:40.360 --> 3:39:41.960
 There's a lot of exciting developments.

3:39:41.960 --> 3:39:44.320
 And the scale at which those developments

3:39:44.320 --> 3:39:46.680
 might actually have a transformative impact,

3:39:46.680 --> 3:39:48.960
 the time scale is unclear.

3:39:48.960 --> 3:39:51.760
 It seems like we're certainly overpromising.

3:39:51.760 --> 3:39:54.360
 We dream too big and too aggressively

3:39:54.360 --> 3:39:56.320
 in the AI community, but in a lot of communities.

3:39:56.320 --> 3:39:58.440
 And I'm happy to give people the benefit of the doubt

3:39:58.440 --> 3:39:59.840
 when they're overpromising,

3:39:59.840 --> 3:40:01.680
 but not when they're making their own money.

3:40:01.680 --> 3:40:03.640
 When you start making your own currency,

3:40:03.640 --> 3:40:05.680
 then you don't get the benefit of the doubt.

3:40:05.680 --> 3:40:08.440
 Because if your idea needs you to have a new currency

3:40:08.440 --> 3:40:10.600
 that you print when Bitcoin is out there,

3:40:10.600 --> 3:40:12.560
 then I'm gonna go ahead and assume

3:40:12.560 --> 3:40:13.400
 that you're doing this for the money.

3:40:13.400 --> 3:40:14.360
 It's a good time to mention

3:40:14.360 --> 3:40:19.080
 that I am actually launching my new coin called LexCoin.

3:40:19.080 --> 3:40:20.000
 You mean ShitCoin.

3:40:20.000 --> 3:40:20.840
 Yes.

3:40:20.840 --> 3:40:22.480
 Oh, God.

3:40:22.480 --> 3:40:24.400
 I'm gonna have to block you with love.

3:40:26.120 --> 3:40:28.200
 Okay, one thing I wanted to ask you about

3:40:28.200 --> 3:40:33.200
 is the Feds, this paper they released in January 20th

3:40:34.920 --> 3:40:39.160
 on the potential central bank digital currency, CBDC.

3:40:39.160 --> 3:40:40.360
 What are your thoughts about that?

3:40:40.360 --> 3:40:43.560
 Is it just another, like, is there pros and cons to this?

3:40:43.560 --> 3:40:45.160
 Is it at all interesting to you

3:40:45.160 --> 3:40:47.160
 that they're even considering this kind of thing?

3:40:47.160 --> 3:40:51.760
 I used to think that it's just basically a waffle.

3:40:51.760 --> 3:40:53.320
 It's meaningless.

3:40:53.320 --> 3:40:55.120
 And because as it exists,

3:40:55.120 --> 3:40:57.520
 the dollar is a central bank digital currency.

3:40:57.520 --> 3:40:59.520
 The vast majority of dollars are digital.

3:40:59.520 --> 3:41:03.280
 And, but I think the way that over the last couple of years

3:41:03.280 --> 3:41:04.240
 I've changed my mind on this,

3:41:04.240 --> 3:41:08.320
 I think there's some serious substance behind these ideas.

3:41:08.320 --> 3:41:10.720
 And what they mean effectively

3:41:10.720 --> 3:41:14.000
 is the disintermediation of the banking system

3:41:14.000 --> 3:41:17.000
 and giving everybody an account at the Federal Reserve.

3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:21.240
 This is kind of the really dangerous idea.

3:41:21.240 --> 3:41:22.840
 And I think this is enormously significant.

3:41:22.840 --> 3:41:25.800
 Effectively, as somebody who's lived in the Soviet Union,

3:41:25.800 --> 3:41:27.880
 what this is, is the return of the Gosbank

3:41:27.880 --> 3:41:30.720
 on a global scale with modern technology.

3:41:30.720 --> 3:41:31.760
 So under the Soviet Union,

3:41:31.760 --> 3:41:34.760
 there was something called the Gosbank or People's Bank.

3:41:34.760 --> 3:41:36.280
 And that was the only bank in the country.

3:41:36.280 --> 3:41:39.440
 And you had an account with the National Bank.

3:41:39.440 --> 3:41:42.800
 And if you said something wrong,

3:41:42.800 --> 3:41:45.880
 your money got terminated from the Gosbank.

3:41:45.880 --> 3:41:47.440
 Now, imagine that combined

3:41:47.440 --> 3:41:50.520
 with the power of digital technology.

3:41:50.520 --> 3:41:52.360
 And you can see that this could be

3:41:52.360 --> 3:41:56.080
 an enormously powerful technology really,

3:41:56.080 --> 3:41:58.800
 because if banks are out of the picture,

3:41:58.800 --> 3:42:03.160
 then we changed the fundamental reality of fiat

3:42:03.160 --> 3:42:05.840
 as being the creation of money through lending.

3:42:05.840 --> 3:42:08.800
 And then it becomes the creation of money truly by fiat,

3:42:08.800 --> 3:42:10.080
 by government fiat.

3:42:10.080 --> 3:42:13.200
 So we moved to a system in which money is just basically,

3:42:14.320 --> 3:42:16.560
 it's like we have money that is pieces of paper.

3:42:16.560 --> 3:42:18.040
 And every time we've had money,

3:42:18.040 --> 3:42:20.440
 we've had fiat money that was just pieces of paper,

3:42:20.440 --> 3:42:21.920
 it collapsed very quickly.

3:42:22.840 --> 3:42:25.160
 With the current system, money is credit.

3:42:25.160 --> 3:42:28.240
 And the creation of credit is restricted to some point.

3:42:28.240 --> 3:42:30.160
 And the creation of credit is self correcting.

3:42:30.160 --> 3:42:32.040
 I discussed this in the fiat standard.

3:42:32.040 --> 3:42:35.120
 If the central bank allows banks to create too much credit,

3:42:35.120 --> 3:42:35.960
 that creates a bubble.

3:42:35.960 --> 3:42:38.280
 And then there's a collapse in the money supply,

3:42:38.280 --> 3:42:40.280
 which prevents hyperinflation from happening

3:42:40.280 --> 3:42:44.160
 because the money creation is self destructive,

3:42:44.160 --> 3:42:45.800
 it's self correcting.

3:42:45.800 --> 3:42:49.880
 So you end up with an average of like 7% per year increase

3:42:49.880 --> 3:42:52.840
 because you have 10% for five years

3:42:52.840 --> 3:42:55.840
 and then you get negative 20% for one year

3:42:55.840 --> 3:42:57.760
 and it's correcting.

3:42:57.760 --> 3:43:00.000
 But now if you get rid of the credit creation mechanism,

3:43:00.000 --> 3:43:02.240
 it's just assigning money directly,

3:43:02.240 --> 3:43:04.840
 we're likely gonna get much faster inflation.

3:43:04.840 --> 3:43:08.200
 And I think that's obviously the huge problem

3:43:08.200 --> 3:43:10.240
 and perhaps the even bigger problem

3:43:10.240 --> 3:43:12.440
 is the enormous amount of power

3:43:12.440 --> 3:43:14.160
 that it gives to governments.

3:43:14.160 --> 3:43:18.000
 It allows them to create an awful dystopia

3:43:18.000 --> 3:43:22.520
 where you've got your money on your phone

3:43:22.520 --> 3:43:27.120
 and anything you do is completely supervised

3:43:27.120 --> 3:43:28.680
 and controlled through your spending.

3:43:28.680 --> 3:43:31.880
 So they wanna introduce a new lockdown,

3:43:31.880 --> 3:43:34.040
 then they'll just make your money not work.

3:43:34.040 --> 3:43:36.920
 Your money is broken today, you can't spend money

3:43:36.920 --> 3:43:39.440
 or you can only spend money in your local supermarket

3:43:39.440 --> 3:43:40.360
 for the next three months

3:43:40.360 --> 3:43:42.560
 because you can't leave your neighborhood,

3:43:42.560 --> 3:43:45.160
 your money stops working outside of your neighborhood.

3:43:45.160 --> 3:43:48.040
 This Chinese social credit score system

3:43:48.040 --> 3:43:50.040
 is an example of this.

3:43:50.040 --> 3:43:53.680
 And I think, I don't know, I don't have a crystal ball,

3:43:53.680 --> 3:43:55.160
 so I don't know what the likelihood is

3:43:55.160 --> 3:43:58.160
 of implementing something like this in the US.

3:43:58.160 --> 3:43:59.920
 I've discussed it with Michael Saylor,

3:43:59.920 --> 3:44:02.000
 he thinks it's highly unlikely.

3:44:02.000 --> 3:44:05.280
 He thinks the people who've been pushing this

3:44:05.280 --> 3:44:07.160
 are very far from the position of power

3:44:07.160 --> 3:44:10.680
 and the traditional monetary and financial system

3:44:10.680 --> 3:44:13.600
 is going to survive intact.

3:44:13.600 --> 3:44:15.480
 I certainly hope so.

3:44:15.480 --> 3:44:17.960
 I think this would be a terrible thing if it comes to pass.

3:44:17.960 --> 3:44:19.120
 But I don't think, many people think

3:44:19.120 --> 3:44:21.400
 that it is something that would undermine Bitcoin.

3:44:21.400 --> 3:44:24.560
 Like a lot of common objection to Bitcoin is,

3:44:24.560 --> 3:44:26.160
 well, governments are just gonna launch

3:44:26.160 --> 3:44:27.600
 their own digital currencies

3:44:27.600 --> 3:44:28.920
 and then Bitcoin is gonna die.

3:44:28.920 --> 3:44:31.040
 And I think this is completely missing the point.

3:44:31.040 --> 3:44:33.520
 People think Bitcoin is important because it's digital.

3:44:33.520 --> 3:44:34.680
 It's not.

3:44:34.680 --> 3:44:36.920
 National currencies can be digital.

3:44:36.920 --> 3:44:39.520
 Bitcoin is important because it's not inflationary

3:44:39.520 --> 3:44:41.400
 and because nobody controls it.

3:44:41.400 --> 3:44:42.720
 Central bank digital currencies

3:44:42.720 --> 3:44:44.840
 are likely to be very inflationary

3:44:44.840 --> 3:44:47.800
 and they're likely to have very strong control at the top.

3:44:47.800 --> 3:44:50.480
 So if anything, they are an advertisement for Bitcoin

3:44:50.480 --> 3:44:52.720
 rather than a replacement for it.

3:44:52.720 --> 3:44:54.040
 If it's Bitcoin, if it's gold,

3:44:54.040 --> 3:44:56.920
 it's a way for multiple nations to partake.

3:44:56.920 --> 3:44:59.560
 So if you were to imagine a future

3:44:59.560 --> 3:45:03.720
 where we move from the fiat standard

3:45:03.720 --> 3:45:06.760
 back to the gold standard and then to the Bitcoin standard

3:45:06.760 --> 3:45:10.320
 or skipping that, going directly to the Bitcoin standard,

3:45:10.320 --> 3:45:12.160
 what would it take?

3:45:12.160 --> 3:45:13.920
 Is it gradual, is it immediate?

3:45:14.760 --> 3:45:17.480
 What are possible trajectories that take us?

3:45:17.480 --> 3:45:19.800
 Well, basically where the final sort of empirical

3:45:19.800 --> 3:45:22.160
 observation is that you overtake,

3:45:22.160 --> 3:45:26.600
 Bitcoin overtakes first gold and then bonds

3:45:26.600 --> 3:45:31.600
 in terms of its monetary power in the world.

3:45:31.760 --> 3:45:34.360
 But like just specifically from a government perspective,

3:45:34.360 --> 3:45:37.160
 how do we move the United States, China, Russia,

3:45:37.160 --> 3:45:42.160
 India, European Union to a Bitcoin standard?

3:45:43.320 --> 3:45:45.000
 I'm not entirely concerned about

3:45:45.000 --> 3:45:46.200
 whether governments move or not.

3:45:46.200 --> 3:45:50.040
 In fact, I'd be very happy for them not to move

3:45:50.040 --> 3:45:53.320
 as long as possible so that individuals can accumulate

3:45:53.320 --> 3:45:56.400
 more and more Bitcoin while it's still cheap.

3:45:56.400 --> 3:46:01.320
 So the people will move and the governments will catch up.

3:46:01.320 --> 3:46:04.000
 Yeah, and I think this is kind of what I allude to.

3:46:04.000 --> 3:46:05.680
 I mean, the point of the fiat standard,

3:46:05.680 --> 3:46:07.880
 the fiat standard is really a Bitcoin book

3:46:07.880 --> 3:46:10.080
 and it talks about fiat most of the time,

3:46:10.080 --> 3:46:13.960
 but it does so to analyze Bitcoin and the rise of Bitcoin.

3:46:13.960 --> 3:46:16.480
 In the final chapter, I discuss how I think

3:46:16.480 --> 3:46:18.040
 this relationship plays out.

3:46:22.080 --> 3:46:23.320
 The way that I tend to think of it

3:46:23.320 --> 3:46:25.040
 is that most likely what's going to happen

3:46:25.040 --> 3:46:28.720
 is we're gonna have kind of a financial apartheid

3:46:28.720 --> 3:46:31.080
 where there's going to be two monetary systems.

3:46:31.080 --> 3:46:34.520
 One is government controlled and it comes

3:46:34.520 --> 3:46:37.720
 with increasing amounts of surveillance and inflation.

3:46:37.720 --> 3:46:41.360
 And then if you want, you can just opt out of that

3:46:41.360 --> 3:46:42.840
 and get into Bitcoin.

3:46:42.840 --> 3:46:45.680
 And it's likely going to be difficult for governments

3:46:45.680 --> 3:46:48.360
 to stop people from getting into Bitcoin

3:46:48.360 --> 3:46:49.840
 for all of the technical reasons

3:46:49.840 --> 3:46:52.280
 that make it very hard to stop Bitcoin.

3:46:52.280 --> 3:46:54.120
 So then we have this alternative that is Bitcoin,

3:46:54.120 --> 3:46:57.960
 which is not inflationary and does not have

3:46:57.960 --> 3:47:00.840
 a central authority that can censor it.

3:47:00.840 --> 3:47:04.800
 I think gradually is my hope

3:47:04.800 --> 3:47:07.320
 and I also think my most likely scenario,

3:47:07.320 --> 3:47:10.920
 but maybe I am biased because everybody thinks

3:47:10.920 --> 3:47:13.000
 what they want is what's gonna happen.

3:47:13.000 --> 3:47:16.280
 I think we're just gonna witness the same relationship

3:47:16.280 --> 3:47:18.800
 because governments make their currencies

3:47:18.800 --> 3:47:22.560
 so that they can devalue them and Bitcoin thrives on that.

3:47:22.560 --> 3:47:24.080
 And more and more people are gonna learn,

3:47:24.080 --> 3:47:26.120
 more and more people are gonna find out.

3:47:26.120 --> 3:47:29.840
 And whether it's through curiosity or self interest

3:47:29.840 --> 3:47:32.400
 or through the destruction of the national currency,

3:47:32.400 --> 3:47:34.800
 all roads lead to a Bitcoin.

3:47:34.800 --> 3:47:36.480
 So more and more people are gonna buy Bitcoin,

3:47:36.480 --> 3:47:38.000
 the price of Bitcoin is going to go up.

3:47:38.000 --> 3:47:41.120
 And as it goes up, Bitcoin becomes a more significant part

3:47:41.120 --> 3:47:42.040
 of the world economy.

3:47:42.040 --> 3:47:45.360
 And this is something that the skeptics don't get.

3:47:45.360 --> 3:47:48.800
 Like a lot of the academic skeptics to Bitcoin,

3:47:48.800 --> 3:47:50.840
 they offer up all of these theories

3:47:50.840 --> 3:47:53.520
 about why they think Bitcoin can't work

3:47:53.520 --> 3:47:56.120
 and then they present it and they think,

3:47:56.120 --> 3:47:58.040
 they've delivered the knockout blow

3:47:58.040 --> 3:47:59.640
 as if Bitcoin needs their permission

3:47:59.640 --> 3:48:01.200
 or the world is going to need their permission.

3:48:01.200 --> 3:48:02.880
 Well, the reality is people are gonna join Bitcoin

3:48:02.880 --> 3:48:05.000
 out of greed, out of self interest.

3:48:05.000 --> 3:48:07.760
 Number go up technology is really

3:48:07.760 --> 3:48:10.000
 what's going to get everybody in.

3:48:10.000 --> 3:48:14.520
 And that's really the Trojan horse for fixing the world.

3:48:14.520 --> 3:48:16.880
 Come for the greed and stay for the revolution.

3:48:16.880 --> 3:48:18.640
 It's gonna keep going up

3:48:18.640 --> 3:48:21.240
 because people don't like to be poor,

3:48:21.240 --> 3:48:23.560
 except for most economists and academics.

3:48:24.600 --> 3:48:25.760
 People don't like to be poor.

3:48:25.760 --> 3:48:28.440
 People don't enjoy getting their wealth destroyed

3:48:28.440 --> 3:48:30.440
 and they care more about their self interest

3:48:30.440 --> 3:48:32.560
 than they care about economic theories

3:48:32.560 --> 3:48:34.600
 about whether this works as money or not.

3:48:34.600 --> 3:48:37.280
 They see their cousin escaped hyperinflation

3:48:37.280 --> 3:48:38.520
 and managed to get a bigger house

3:48:38.520 --> 3:48:40.360
 because they bought Bitcoin five years ago.

3:48:40.360 --> 3:48:43.760
 They realized maybe I should stop mocking my cousin

3:48:43.760 --> 3:48:45.120
 and start buying more Bitcoin.

3:48:45.120 --> 3:48:47.560
 And this is, I think an indomitable force

3:48:47.560 --> 3:48:49.240
 that's going to continue.

3:48:49.240 --> 3:48:53.920
 And one thing, most Bitcoiners tend to lean

3:48:53.920 --> 3:48:57.200
 toward an apocalyptic transition.

3:48:57.200 --> 3:48:59.000
 Fiat's gonna collapse, we're gonna get hyperinflation,

3:48:59.000 --> 3:49:00.280
 everything's gonna be terrible

3:49:00.280 --> 3:49:02.600
 and then we're gonna move to Bitcoin.

3:49:02.600 --> 3:49:05.400
 And I present the case for why I think

3:49:05.400 --> 3:49:07.000
 maybe that might not be the case.

3:49:07.000 --> 3:49:10.840
 Maybe we won't get this kind of apocalyptic scenario.

3:49:10.840 --> 3:49:14.440
 And this was like the conclusion of the fiat standard,

3:49:14.440 --> 3:49:16.800
 which is once you realize that mining fiat

3:49:16.800 --> 3:49:20.920
 is creating debt and Bitcoin is allowing.

3:49:20.920 --> 3:49:22.360
 So in order to have fiat money,

3:49:22.360 --> 3:49:23.920
 we need to have people borrow.

3:49:23.920 --> 3:49:26.040
 We need to have people make loans.

3:49:26.040 --> 3:49:29.800
 And the problem that fiat money runs into today

3:49:29.800 --> 3:49:31.880
 is that if you wanna save money,

3:49:31.880 --> 3:49:35.320
 if you wanna hold savings, you have a problem.

3:49:35.320 --> 3:49:36.720
 Where do you put your savings?

3:49:36.720 --> 3:49:38.800
 So you put your savings in debt

3:49:38.800 --> 3:49:41.000
 in the creation of more bonds.

3:49:41.000 --> 3:49:42.560
 Wherever you take your savings,

3:49:42.560 --> 3:49:44.200
 you create a bubble in those things.

3:49:44.200 --> 3:49:46.000
 And this is why we see a bubble in the stock market,

3:49:46.000 --> 3:49:48.840
 a bubble in the bond market, a bubble in housing.

3:49:48.840 --> 3:49:51.080
 It's because people are looking for savings,

3:49:51.080 --> 3:49:52.360
 looking for a place where they can save.

3:49:52.360 --> 3:49:54.760
 All of those things are crappy saving instruments

3:49:54.760 --> 3:49:58.480
 because they're like copper

3:49:58.480 --> 3:50:00.720
 and that there's nothing to stop the people behind them

3:50:00.720 --> 3:50:01.800
 to make more of them.

3:50:01.800 --> 3:50:05.200
 House builders can build more houses.

3:50:05.200 --> 3:50:06.840
 Governments can issue more bonds.

3:50:07.760 --> 3:50:10.120
 The crappy fraudulent companies can list

3:50:10.120 --> 3:50:12.320
 on the stock market and make more stocks.

3:50:12.320 --> 3:50:14.480
 Well, Bitcoin finally offers us an outlet.

3:50:14.480 --> 3:50:16.800
 We don't need to keep creating more debt.

3:50:16.800 --> 3:50:20.560
 We can invest in this asset that is hard

3:50:20.560 --> 3:50:23.040
 and that is internationally liquid

3:50:23.040 --> 3:50:25.120
 and that nobody can make more of.

3:50:25.120 --> 3:50:26.840
 So there is no bubble in it.

3:50:26.840 --> 3:50:30.160
 There is no mechanism for somebody to increase the supply

3:50:30.160 --> 3:50:31.880
 and bring the price crashing down,

3:50:31.880 --> 3:50:34.520
 like with copper and real estate and bonds.

3:50:34.520 --> 3:50:36.440
 So Bitcoin is the way out.

3:50:36.440 --> 3:50:38.840
 And this is why I think there's a good case to be made

3:50:38.840 --> 3:50:42.560
 for why the fiat authorities might embrace Bitcoin

3:50:42.560 --> 3:50:44.440
 because they'll see it is their way out

3:50:44.440 --> 3:50:49.040
 of this enormous debt bubble that everybody is stuck in.

3:50:49.040 --> 3:50:51.080
 Particularly, the richest and most powerful people

3:50:51.080 --> 3:50:53.240
 in the world and the richest

3:50:53.240 --> 3:50:54.560
 and most powerful governments in the world

3:50:54.560 --> 3:50:56.320
 are the world's biggest borrowers.

3:50:56.320 --> 3:50:57.840
 They're the ones in a lot of debt.

3:50:57.840 --> 3:51:02.840
 So a continuous slow devaluation of the value of that debt

3:51:02.960 --> 3:51:05.440
 as people upgrade and move on to a hard asset

3:51:05.440 --> 3:51:10.440
 that continues to appreciate is the peaceful way

3:51:10.440 --> 3:51:13.000
 that we wind down the fiat ponzi, I think.

3:51:13.000 --> 3:51:15.320
 You could see it being like a political,

3:51:15.320 --> 3:51:18.280
 part of a political platform for future people

3:51:18.280 --> 3:51:21.920
 that run for president, those kinds of things to address.

3:51:21.920 --> 3:51:26.120
 Obviously, it's not just for the powerful and the rich.

3:51:26.120 --> 3:51:28.240
 The people are bothered by the debt.

3:51:28.240 --> 3:51:30.240
 The people are bothered by everything

3:51:30.240 --> 3:51:31.920
 that you describe with fiat.

3:51:31.920 --> 3:51:35.520
 And if you wanna sell yourself in a democracy

3:51:35.520 --> 3:51:38.200
 as a good leader, you might want to make

3:51:38.200 --> 3:51:39.720
 that part of the platform.

3:51:39.720 --> 3:51:41.400
 You mentioned you know Michael Malice.

3:51:41.400 --> 3:51:46.320
 He just texted me asking me to ask you,

3:51:46.320 --> 3:51:49.040
 what do you like best about Michael Malice?

3:51:49.040 --> 3:51:52.800
 If you can spend five to 10 to 20 to an hour

3:51:52.800 --> 3:51:54.760
 talking about the genius of Michael Malice,

3:51:54.760 --> 3:51:57.280
 what do you like?

3:51:57.280 --> 3:51:58.440
 Where does one even start?

3:51:58.440 --> 3:52:00.240
 Well, obviously, the haircut first.

3:52:00.240 --> 3:52:04.000
 Yeah, he just gets sexier with age, that's for sure.

3:52:04.000 --> 3:52:05.400
 That's good.

3:52:05.400 --> 3:52:10.400
 Do you know his ideas, his trolling and humor,

3:52:10.800 --> 3:52:12.960
 have you gotten a chance to interact with him?

3:52:12.960 --> 3:52:16.360
 Yes, yes, I've met Michael maybe 10, 12 years ago

3:52:16.360 --> 3:52:17.400
 in New York.

3:52:17.400 --> 3:52:20.120
 I used to live in New York when he used to live in New York.

3:52:20.120 --> 3:52:21.160
 Met him a couple of times.

3:52:21.160 --> 3:52:24.440
 There was a bunch of anarchists in New York

3:52:24.440 --> 3:52:27.320
 used to throw a happy hour once a month.

3:52:27.320 --> 3:52:30.840
 It was called the High Time Preference Hoppe Hour

3:52:31.720 --> 3:52:34.000
 in honor of Hans Hermann Hoppe.

3:52:34.000 --> 3:52:35.440
 So I met him there a couple of times

3:52:35.440 --> 3:52:39.320
 and we followed each other on Twitter for a while.

3:52:39.320 --> 3:52:41.240
 Is it interesting that you're aware

3:52:41.240 --> 3:52:43.960
 of philosophical differences in your worldviews?

3:52:45.160 --> 3:52:47.400
 No, I think we pretty much see eye to eye.

3:52:48.800 --> 3:52:51.720
 I think the difference is mainly that he spends

3:52:51.720 --> 3:52:53.800
 a lot of time focusing on American politics

3:52:53.800 --> 3:52:55.360
 and American pop culture,

3:52:55.360 --> 3:52:57.840
 which I don't pay much attention to, I guess.

3:52:57.840 --> 3:53:00.400
 So you look more at the monetary system,

3:53:00.400 --> 3:53:02.680
 the economics of it all, and just the history

3:53:02.680 --> 3:53:07.000
 and just looking at it, zooming out at the big picture

3:53:07.000 --> 3:53:07.840
 of it all.

3:53:07.840 --> 3:53:09.440
 Although recently he's working on a book called

3:53:09.440 --> 3:53:14.080
 The White Pill and he's been, every time I see him,

3:53:14.080 --> 3:53:18.880
 I mean, he's in some dark aspect of the 20th century.

3:53:18.880 --> 3:53:22.160
 He's just like, I just finished writing about Holodomor.

3:53:22.160 --> 3:53:25.440
 As you might imagine, he's not taking much, I believe,

3:53:25.440 --> 3:53:27.840
 of a monetary perspective on things.

3:53:27.840 --> 3:53:30.600
 His book, his writing, at least for time,

3:53:30.600 --> 3:53:34.200
 has a kind of philosophical ideology perspective

3:53:34.200 --> 3:53:37.120
 that's outside of the monetary system.

3:53:37.120 --> 3:53:41.600
 But you argue that those are actually inextricably linked.

3:53:41.600 --> 3:53:43.640
 Yeah, and I don't think he would disagree.

3:53:43.640 --> 3:53:44.640
 He would.

3:53:44.640 --> 3:53:49.160
 But a book has to be, can only be so long, I suppose.

3:53:49.160 --> 3:53:52.680
 It can only focus on so many things.

3:53:52.680 --> 3:53:56.200
 If you can put on your wise sage hat

3:53:56.200 --> 3:53:58.560
 and give some advice to young people.

3:53:58.560 --> 3:54:02.000
 I mean, the past four hours have been a kind of advice,

3:54:02.000 --> 3:54:05.320
 but if you can focus, and if somebody in high school

3:54:05.320 --> 3:54:09.400
 or college is thinking about what to do with their career,

3:54:09.400 --> 3:54:11.680
 can have a successful career, or to have a life

3:54:11.680 --> 3:54:13.660
 they can be proud of, what would you tell them?

3:54:13.660 --> 3:54:15.640
 I'd say probably the most important advice

3:54:15.640 --> 3:54:17.320
 that I would give is to find a way

3:54:17.320 --> 3:54:20.240
 to give value to other people.

3:54:20.240 --> 3:54:21.680
 This is really the key thing.

3:54:21.680 --> 3:54:23.680
 You need to wake up every morning

3:54:23.680 --> 3:54:25.640
 and figure out how to serve others.

3:54:25.640 --> 3:54:30.200
 This is the key to everything you want in life.

3:54:30.200 --> 3:54:32.440
 Everything that you want is on the other side

3:54:32.440 --> 3:54:34.440
 of you serving others.

3:54:34.440 --> 3:54:37.500
 So figure out how you can serve others in a good way,

3:54:37.500 --> 3:54:39.600
 how you can do it in a way that they value.

3:54:39.600 --> 3:54:42.280
 And you've got an incredible mechanism

3:54:42.280 --> 3:54:45.040
 for figuring that out, which is the market.

3:54:45.040 --> 3:54:47.160
 Go out there and do things for other people.

3:54:47.160 --> 3:54:49.760
 And you know, the market will tell you.

3:54:49.760 --> 3:54:51.600
 The market will tell you exactly.

3:54:51.600 --> 3:54:53.480
 If you're young, you have the enormous advantage

3:54:53.480 --> 3:54:56.800
 of being able to make mistakes, essentially,

3:54:56.800 --> 3:54:58.120
 and learn from them.

3:54:58.120 --> 3:55:02.120
 So go out there, do things of value for others,

3:55:02.120 --> 3:55:06.320
 figuring out how you can do something that contributes,

3:55:06.320 --> 3:55:07.920
 what is it that you can do that contributes

3:55:07.920 --> 3:55:10.120
 the most value to other people's lives?

3:55:10.120 --> 3:55:13.200
 And increasingly, I think with the modern technology,

3:55:13.200 --> 3:55:15.520
 this is increasingly becoming online.

3:55:15.520 --> 3:55:18.800
 And I think you should consider

3:55:18.800 --> 3:55:21.360
 how you can create value online,

3:55:21.360 --> 3:55:25.320
 because that scales beyond anything that you can do

3:55:25.320 --> 3:55:27.920
 in the physical world in a very, very,

3:55:27.920 --> 3:55:29.320
 well, maybe not beyond, obviously,

3:55:29.320 --> 3:55:33.200
 there are profitable businesses in the physical world.

3:55:33.200 --> 3:55:36.640
 But I think online is enormous potential,

3:55:36.640 --> 3:55:39.080
 and coding, I think, is enormously powerful.

3:55:39.080 --> 3:55:41.040
 I'm not a coder myself, but I strongly recommend

3:55:41.040 --> 3:55:44.120
 people get into learning how to code.

3:55:44.120 --> 3:55:46.380
 And I think it's probably the thing

3:55:46.380 --> 3:55:48.720
 that carries the most power.

3:55:48.720 --> 3:55:51.560
 So initially, we were working with our hands,

3:55:51.560 --> 3:55:52.760
 we started working with machines,

3:55:52.760 --> 3:55:54.480
 machines are much more productive.

3:55:54.480 --> 3:55:57.600
 Well, code is an even higher level of productivity

3:55:57.600 --> 3:56:00.900
 where you basically program the machines to produce things.

3:56:00.900 --> 3:56:05.240
 So, you know, few clicks of a keyboard,

3:56:05.240 --> 3:56:07.440
 and you can move millions of machines

3:56:07.440 --> 3:56:09.240
 around the world in certain ways.

3:56:09.240 --> 3:56:11.300
 So it carries an enormous amount of value.

3:56:11.300 --> 3:56:15.200
 I think I always tell all young people to learn to code,

3:56:15.200 --> 3:56:16.360
 it's the best thing.

3:56:16.360 --> 3:56:18.680
 I used to tell it to my students when I was at university,

3:56:18.680 --> 3:56:21.640
 I tell them to drop out and go learn to code.

3:56:21.640 --> 3:56:23.680
 It's probably a better use of their time and money.

3:56:23.680 --> 3:56:25.440
 Well, you could probably do both.

3:56:25.440 --> 3:56:26.280
 Yeah.

3:56:26.280 --> 3:56:28.080
 University has an interesting function.

3:56:28.080 --> 3:56:30.440
 I mean, probably you and I have different perspective

3:56:30.440 --> 3:56:32.240
 on this, probably has to do with a little bit

3:56:32.240 --> 3:56:35.800
 of a different journey in terms of fields,

3:56:35.800 --> 3:56:38.420
 because I'm so, I've stayed engineering focused

3:56:38.420 --> 3:56:40.400
 for a long time, and there's less,

3:56:40.400 --> 3:56:41.840
 some of the troubles you might highlight

3:56:41.840 --> 3:56:44.280
 in the education system, there's less troubles

3:56:44.280 --> 3:56:46.760
 of that kind in engineering,

3:56:46.760 --> 3:56:49.880
 because math hasn't changed for a long time.

3:56:49.880 --> 3:56:53.360
 So a lot of it is just doing hard things,

3:56:53.360 --> 3:56:55.400
 being forced to do hard things,

3:56:55.400 --> 3:56:57.740
 and becoming a bit of a generalist,

3:56:57.740 --> 3:57:00.600
 while on the side, you're also becoming a specialist

3:57:01.840 --> 3:57:04.380
 based on your own passion, driven by your own passion.

3:57:04.380 --> 3:57:06.720
 So school, at least high school,

3:57:06.720 --> 3:57:07.680
 I don't know about the university,

3:57:07.680 --> 3:57:11.440
 but high school has a really nice,

3:57:11.440 --> 3:57:13.600
 one of the only times in your life,

3:57:13.600 --> 3:57:17.280
 at least in my life, I was forced,

3:57:17.280 --> 3:57:20.880
 but now I see given the opportunity

3:57:20.880 --> 3:57:24.480
 to spend my entire day learning broadly.

3:57:24.480 --> 3:57:25.960
 And that's something, I don't know,

3:57:25.960 --> 3:57:28.000
 the way time works, it just runs away from you,

3:57:28.000 --> 3:57:30.160
 and you never really get a chance to do,

3:57:30.160 --> 3:57:33.720
 learn quite that broadly again.

3:57:33.720 --> 3:57:35.320
 That's the curse of specialization,

3:57:35.320 --> 3:57:37.360
 is you kind of never get a chance

3:57:37.360 --> 3:57:39.200
 to study biology, chemistry.

3:57:39.200 --> 3:57:42.680
 If you're a physicist, time runs away from you.

3:57:42.680 --> 3:57:46.960
 So enjoy the broad education of it.

3:57:46.960 --> 3:57:48.760
 But yeah, like you said,

3:57:48.760 --> 3:57:52.200
 find the things that valued by the market.

3:57:53.160 --> 3:57:56.200
 And on the other side of it, you said all the good stuff.

3:57:56.200 --> 3:57:58.520
 So that's also a way to get happiness.

3:57:58.520 --> 3:57:59.960
 Yeah, and I'll also add,

3:57:59.960 --> 3:58:01.780
 the horse that I like to whip all the time

3:58:01.780 --> 3:58:04.240
 is the low time preference aspect of things,

3:58:04.240 --> 3:58:06.080
 saving with Bitcoin.

3:58:06.080 --> 3:58:08.640
 So I think my advice to young people is,

3:58:08.640 --> 3:58:11.100
 when you're young, you think of the world

3:58:11.100 --> 3:58:13.720
 in a very short term, generally.

3:58:13.720 --> 3:58:15.800
 You're focused on the present,

3:58:15.800 --> 3:58:17.380
 and you think that everything that's happening

3:58:17.380 --> 3:58:18.920
 in the present is the most important thing

3:58:18.920 --> 3:58:21.640
 that's ever gonna happen in the history of humanity.

3:58:21.640 --> 3:58:23.640
 Lower your time preference, think about the future,

3:58:23.640 --> 3:58:25.620
 think about, think further down the line,

3:58:25.620 --> 3:58:28.340
 think about the consequences of the things you do,

3:58:28.340 --> 3:58:29.180
 and then what?

3:58:29.180 --> 3:58:31.120
 And so you do this now, it feels good today,

3:58:31.120 --> 3:58:33.520
 but then what happens tomorrow?

3:58:33.520 --> 3:58:35.320
 You go out, you drink, you enjoy yourself,

3:58:35.320 --> 3:58:37.380
 well, think about the hangover.

3:58:37.380 --> 3:58:40.280
 But more in longterm, think about the implication

3:58:40.280 --> 3:58:42.320
 of living this kind of life.

3:58:42.320 --> 3:58:44.280
 Think about every decision that you make,

3:58:44.280 --> 3:58:46.080
 the longterm implication of it.

3:58:46.080 --> 3:58:47.640
 And part of that is Bitcoin,

3:58:47.640 --> 3:58:49.560
 part of that is save in Bitcoin.

3:58:49.560 --> 3:58:54.520
 I urge everybody to put savings in Bitcoin for the longterm.

3:58:54.520 --> 3:58:56.400
 Don't buy Bitcoin for the short term,

3:58:56.400 --> 3:58:59.240
 don't buy Bitcoin today so that you can sell it,

3:58:59.240 --> 3:59:00.780
 don't put your savings in Bitcoin today

3:59:00.780 --> 3:59:04.240
 so that you can sell it all next month and buy a house.

3:59:04.240 --> 3:59:07.560
 Put money in Bitcoin that you expect to keep in Bitcoin

3:59:07.560 --> 3:59:11.640
 for another five, 10 years or so,

3:59:11.640 --> 3:59:13.980
 at least four years is what I recommend for people.

3:59:13.980 --> 3:59:15.960
 So keep a low time preference,

3:59:15.960 --> 3:59:18.320
 focus on the future, and save in Bitcoin.

3:59:18.320 --> 3:59:21.320
 And learn about how to buy Bitcoin,

3:59:21.320 --> 3:59:23.420
 how to learn about all this technology.

3:59:23.420 --> 3:59:24.800
 Part of this is this conversation,

3:59:24.800 --> 3:59:26.560
 but there's so much awesome material out there.

3:59:26.560 --> 3:59:28.240
 And thank you, by the way,

3:59:28.240 --> 3:59:30.520
 for this gift of a hardware wallet.

3:59:30.520 --> 3:59:31.360
 Nice.

3:59:31.360 --> 3:59:33.880
 So you should definitely invest in it yourself.

3:59:33.880 --> 3:59:36.760
 And what would you call this?

3:59:36.760 --> 3:59:37.600
 These are?

3:59:37.600 --> 3:59:38.420
 Open dimes.

3:59:38.420 --> 3:59:39.400
 Open dimes, yeah.

3:59:39.400 --> 3:59:41.800
 So this is like USB that you can,

3:59:41.800 --> 3:59:44.080
 like a hardware device that stores Bitcoin.

3:59:44.080 --> 3:59:45.560
 Yeah, so you don't have to worry

3:59:45.560 --> 3:59:47.720
 about knowing the password.

3:59:47.720 --> 3:59:50.420
 It contains the password within it and it's tamper proof.

3:59:50.420 --> 3:59:52.240
 So you can save the Bitcoin on it and.

3:59:52.240 --> 3:59:54.380
 So when the apocalypse comes,

3:59:54.380 --> 3:59:56.920
 you need the value to be stored,

3:59:56.920 --> 3:59:58.440
 an actual thing that you can have

3:59:58.440 --> 3:59:59.880
 in your physical possession.

3:59:59.880 --> 4:00:00.700
 Yeah.

4:00:00.700 --> 4:00:02.220
 That's exactly what this is.

4:00:02.220 --> 4:00:04.640
 You've had a heck of a life.

4:00:04.640 --> 4:00:07.880
 You've been in a bunch of places in this world.

4:00:07.880 --> 4:00:08.940
 A lot of places.

4:00:08.940 --> 4:00:12.840
 Life is not easy in some of those places.

4:00:12.840 --> 4:00:14.840
 What has been, if you can take a step

4:00:14.840 --> 4:00:19.320
 to maybe a bit of a dark step for a short time,

4:00:19.320 --> 4:00:23.720
 what has been maybe darkest time period,

4:00:23.720 --> 4:00:26.040
 place you've ever gone in your mind,

4:00:26.040 --> 4:00:28.520
 a dark period of your life,

4:00:28.520 --> 4:00:32.160
 a struggle you had to overcome, had to survive?

4:00:32.160 --> 4:00:33.680
 Well, I'm Palestinian.

4:00:33.680 --> 4:00:36.560
 So that is the tragedy of my life.

4:00:36.560 --> 4:00:37.960
 I'm Palestinian Jordanian.

4:00:38.960 --> 4:00:43.920
 My family's suffered a lot because of this historically.

4:00:43.920 --> 4:00:47.040
 I grew up in Ramallah in the West Bank.

4:00:47.040 --> 4:00:50.480
 I wasn't ideal to see that.

4:00:51.560 --> 4:00:54.200
 People like to think of it as this intractable conflict

4:00:54.200 --> 4:00:55.800
 between two bitter enemies.

4:00:55.800 --> 4:00:59.800
 But the reality of the matter is that it's not.

4:00:59.800 --> 4:01:02.020
 A foreign ideology came in with the idea

4:01:02.020 --> 4:01:04.480
 that this country needs to be occupied

4:01:04.480 --> 4:01:06.880
 by people from only one religion

4:01:06.880 --> 4:01:09.720
 and the existing population, which,

4:01:09.720 --> 4:01:12.600
 I mean, Jews had always lived in Palestine historically.

4:01:12.600 --> 4:01:15.040
 And at the turn of the 20th century,

4:01:15.040 --> 4:01:16.920
 they were only 10% of the population.

4:01:16.920 --> 4:01:19.600
 But then with the birth of fiat money,

4:01:19.600 --> 4:01:22.880
 incidentally, the link with all of this is that

4:01:22.880 --> 4:01:25.640
 when the Bank of England went off gold,

4:01:25.640 --> 4:01:28.200
 a big reason why they were able to pull that off

4:01:28.200 --> 4:01:31.040
 was that the Rothschild banking family supported them.

4:01:31.040 --> 4:01:33.520
 And in exchange, the Rothschilds got Palestine.

4:01:33.520 --> 4:01:37.640
 And the Balfour Declaration was written

4:01:37.640 --> 4:01:42.640
 by the government of Britain to the Rothschild family,

4:01:42.720 --> 4:01:47.600
 telling them that they'd like to make Palestine

4:01:47.600 --> 4:01:49.480
 a homeland for Jews.

4:01:49.480 --> 4:01:51.880
 So obviously that's not very convenient

4:01:51.880 --> 4:01:54.720
 for people who are not Jewish, for whom that is a homeland.

4:01:54.720 --> 4:01:59.720
 And the past 80 years has been a very painful struggle.

4:01:59.720 --> 4:02:01.320
 If you happen to not be Jewish.

4:02:01.320 --> 4:02:04.600
 And obviously, you know, obviously Palestinians

4:02:04.600 --> 4:02:06.640
 have done all kinds of things trying to fight back

4:02:06.640 --> 4:02:09.040
 and they've done all kinds of wrong things.

4:02:09.040 --> 4:02:12.000
 But I don't think you can escape the fundamental reality

4:02:12.000 --> 4:02:15.000
 underlying this, which is that if you're not Jewish,

4:02:15.000 --> 4:02:18.080
 you are being moved out of the land.

4:02:18.080 --> 4:02:21.080
 And so it's happened in 1947, 48,

4:02:21.080 --> 4:02:24.600
 happened in 1976, 1967,

4:02:24.600 --> 4:02:26.460
 more land was taken over by Israel.

4:02:26.460 --> 4:02:28.960
 Now you see it with the settlements.

4:02:28.960 --> 4:02:31.080
 You know, if you ignore the day to day headlines

4:02:31.080 --> 4:02:33.080
 and you ignore the media propaganda

4:02:33.080 --> 4:02:34.760
 and you ignore all of this,

4:02:34.760 --> 4:02:36.600
 there's a very clear thing that is happening,

4:02:36.600 --> 4:02:41.600
 which is more land owned by an exclusive ideology

4:02:42.280 --> 4:02:43.920
 that believes this land needs to be owned

4:02:43.920 --> 4:02:45.480
 by people from one religion

4:02:45.480 --> 4:02:47.860
 and everybody else is being kicked out.

4:02:47.860 --> 4:02:52.600
 And so that is the tragedy of my life.

4:02:52.600 --> 4:02:55.920
 And my wife is also a Palestinian refugee from Lebanon

4:02:55.920 --> 4:02:59.520
 and her family was evicted from Jaffa,

4:02:59.520 --> 4:03:02.880
 which is today on the outskirts of Tel Aviv.

4:03:02.880 --> 4:03:05.480
 They still have their homes in Jaffa.

4:03:05.480 --> 4:03:06.760
 Their homes are being, you know,

4:03:06.760 --> 4:03:08.120
 they got kicked out of their homes

4:03:08.120 --> 4:03:09.720
 and their lands and their property.

4:03:09.720 --> 4:03:11.620
 They became refugees in Lebanon.

4:03:11.620 --> 4:03:14.920
 So my children, you know, it's an ongoing tragedy.

4:03:14.920 --> 4:03:16.420
 It's not something that is,

4:03:18.160 --> 4:03:20.920
 a lot of the people that think of it as,

4:03:20.920 --> 4:03:22.760
 you know, they think Palestinians are just out there

4:03:22.760 --> 4:03:25.120
 to get Israelis because they hate them,

4:03:25.120 --> 4:03:27.720
 but it's an inescapable tragedy.

4:03:27.720 --> 4:03:29.200
 I don't have a home anywhere.

4:03:29.200 --> 4:03:32.200
 Is there an escape from this tragedy in the future

4:03:32.200 --> 4:03:36.620
 that you see if you zoom out across the scale of decades,

4:03:38.480 --> 4:03:39.980
 will we see,

4:03:41.860 --> 4:03:44.320
 I hesitate to say peace,

4:03:44.320 --> 4:03:49.320
 but a significant decrease in human suffering

4:03:50.080 --> 4:03:52.160
 in this part of the region?

4:03:52.160 --> 4:03:53.360
 I certainly hope so.

4:03:53.360 --> 4:03:58.120
 And I think, you know, my interest in Bitcoin comes from,

4:03:58.120 --> 4:04:02.000
 came from a place of desperation with the situation there.

4:04:02.000 --> 4:04:04.920
 Traditional politics is a dead end.

4:04:05.880 --> 4:04:08.080
 I don't see what I can be doing

4:04:08.080 --> 4:04:11.900
 to make things better there using traditional politics.

4:04:11.900 --> 4:04:14.600
 And I think a good friend of mine, Pierre Rochard,

4:04:14.600 --> 4:04:16.120
 you may know him on Twitter,

4:04:16.120 --> 4:04:18.800
 one of the brightest minds in Bitcoin in my opinion,

4:04:18.800 --> 4:04:20.960
 he told me his theory is that Bitcoin

4:04:20.960 --> 4:04:22.560
 is gonna bring peace to the Middle East

4:04:22.560 --> 4:04:24.120
 because land is a shit coin.

4:04:24.120 --> 4:04:29.120
 And I think he's got a very good point there,

4:04:30.040 --> 4:04:32.360
 that this fixation with land

4:04:32.360 --> 4:04:35.400
 and the bitterness with which people have to live,

4:04:35.400 --> 4:04:38.520
 land is likely to decline

4:04:38.520 --> 4:04:40.800
 when people are gonna have a form of property

4:04:40.800 --> 4:04:42.240
 that they can keep.

4:04:42.240 --> 4:04:45.000
 And so hopefully that will help in one way.

4:04:45.000 --> 4:04:47.200
 And of course the more obvious way

4:04:47.200 --> 4:04:50.080
 is that this is a conflict of governments

4:04:50.080 --> 4:04:52.480
 and it's a conflict that is financed by fiat.

4:04:52.480 --> 4:04:56.560
 And from day one, the entirely insane notion

4:04:56.560 --> 4:05:01.560
 that you could build a national and ethnic homeland.

4:05:01.640 --> 4:05:03.880
 And of course, this is the early 20th century.

4:05:03.880 --> 4:05:08.880
 So the idea behind Zionism is coming from the same place

4:05:09.000 --> 4:05:11.720
 where all these other ethnic nationalisms of Europe

4:05:11.720 --> 4:05:12.560
 were emerging.

4:05:12.560 --> 4:05:16.520
 And we saw how well, how horribly these worked out.

4:05:16.520 --> 4:05:17.920
 But the idea that you could,

4:05:19.280 --> 4:05:21.240
 it's one thing to say we wanna build a homeland

4:05:21.240 --> 4:05:23.600
 for Germans in Germany.

4:05:23.600 --> 4:05:25.240
 It's one thing to say we wanna build the homelands

4:05:25.240 --> 4:05:28.040
 for Germans somewhere else.

4:05:28.040 --> 4:05:32.400
 And that was Palestine, that was Zionism.

4:05:32.400 --> 4:05:34.640
 And that was only possible thanks to fiat,

4:05:34.640 --> 4:05:36.600
 thanks to the ability of the British government

4:05:36.600 --> 4:05:39.400
 and all these other governments to continue to finance

4:05:39.400 --> 4:05:42.120
 this colonialist effort over time.

4:05:42.120 --> 4:05:45.880
 And it continues to finance war

4:05:45.880 --> 4:05:50.360
 and we see war all over the world continue to escalate

4:05:50.360 --> 4:05:53.480
 because the people who'd make the decision

4:05:53.480 --> 4:05:55.720
 to escalate the war are not the ones who are paying for it

4:05:55.720 --> 4:05:57.120
 and they're not the ones who are fighting.

4:05:57.120 --> 4:05:59.080
 They're the ones who sit in offices.

4:05:59.080 --> 4:06:02.000
 And in the case of most of Middle Eastern conflict,

4:06:02.000 --> 4:06:05.320
 it's people who live abroad.

4:06:05.320 --> 4:06:07.000
 It's people who are abroad who are not part of it

4:06:07.000 --> 4:06:09.160
 who just are emotionally charged to it

4:06:09.160 --> 4:06:11.160
 because they watch it on TV.

4:06:11.160 --> 4:06:14.280
 So you have billions of Muslims around the world

4:06:14.280 --> 4:06:16.520
 and Jews around the world

4:06:16.520 --> 4:06:19.400
 who feel extremely emotionally attached to it.

4:06:19.400 --> 4:06:20.360
 They're not the ones fighting.

4:06:20.360 --> 4:06:22.520
 They're not the ones paying their own money.

4:06:22.520 --> 4:06:24.880
 They're just getting governments to send money

4:06:24.880 --> 4:06:27.520
 and to send weapons and to take part.

4:06:27.520 --> 4:06:32.520
 And it's fun as a spectator sport

4:06:32.520 --> 4:06:33.960
 for most of these people

4:06:33.960 --> 4:06:35.440
 because they don't get to live in it.

4:06:35.440 --> 4:06:37.080
 But I got to live in it, I saw it.

4:06:37.080 --> 4:06:37.920
 I grew up there.

4:06:37.920 --> 4:06:40.800
 I saw the settlement expansion.

4:06:40.800 --> 4:06:43.800
 And recently a few weeks ago, I went back to Ramallah

4:06:43.800 --> 4:06:47.400
 and it's amazing every time you go,

4:06:47.400 --> 4:06:50.920
 the settlements are just growing in an astonishing way.

4:06:50.920 --> 4:06:55.240
 Like it's not just housing units that are going up.

4:06:55.240 --> 4:06:57.560
 It's an entire attempt to build,

4:06:58.720 --> 4:07:01.640
 to basically suffocate Palestinian areas

4:07:01.640 --> 4:07:03.060
 and force Palestinians to leave

4:07:03.060 --> 4:07:06.300
 or keep them living in horrific conditions.

4:07:07.580 --> 4:07:11.760
 And if I may, just because I have family in Ukraine,

4:07:11.760 --> 4:07:15.620
 I have family in Russia, since this war,

4:07:15.620 --> 4:07:17.760
 echoes of similar things are happening

4:07:17.760 --> 4:07:19.600
 in that part of the world too.

4:07:19.600 --> 4:07:23.600
 And I shudder to think about the decades to come

4:07:23.600 --> 4:07:25.400
 of the hate that is brewing,

4:07:25.400 --> 4:07:27.200
 the suffering that is brewing

4:07:27.200 --> 4:07:29.920
 based on decisions and pressures

4:07:29.920 --> 4:07:34.920
 and from not always people directly impacted by this.

4:07:36.840 --> 4:07:40.960
 So again, it feels like that military conflict

4:07:40.960 --> 4:07:45.360
 is not just a creation of like people on the ground.

4:07:45.360 --> 4:07:48.160
 It's a creation of leaders, power centers.

4:07:48.160 --> 4:07:52.440
 And perhaps, again, I'm not smart enough,

4:07:52.440 --> 4:07:55.600
 but even the monetary system probably has a role to play.

4:07:55.600 --> 4:07:56.880
 I absolutely think it does.

4:07:56.880 --> 4:08:00.640
 Monetary system is what allows people

4:08:00.640 --> 4:08:04.160
 to just continue to treat war as a spectator sport.

4:08:04.160 --> 4:08:06.000
 That's really what it comes down to.

4:08:06.000 --> 4:08:09.120
 And it starts with World War I and it's continued.

4:08:09.120 --> 4:08:13.320
 And this is why really, I think I've said this before,

4:08:13.320 --> 4:08:15.720
 I've tweeted this before and it was a pretty popular tweet,

4:08:15.720 --> 4:08:20.160
 but it also got a lot of people to dismiss the idea

4:08:20.160 --> 4:08:22.040
 with mockery, of course.

4:08:22.040 --> 4:08:24.320
 But I really think Bitcoin is the only technology

4:08:24.320 --> 4:08:26.400
 that's going to end World War I.

4:08:26.400 --> 4:08:28.440
 Once World War I started,

4:08:28.440 --> 4:08:30.120
 we got into this endless conflict

4:08:30.120 --> 4:08:32.240
 that's been ongoing since then.

4:08:32.240 --> 4:08:33.840
 If you look at all the world's conflicts today,

4:08:33.840 --> 4:08:36.400
 pretty much they all trace back to World War I.

4:08:36.400 --> 4:08:39.760
 And it's because when that Pandora's box

4:08:39.760 --> 4:08:42.560
 of government control of money was opened,

4:08:42.560 --> 4:08:44.960
 there was no longer a real restraint on war

4:08:44.960 --> 4:08:47.640
 except complete defeat and complete destruction

4:08:47.640 --> 4:08:48.480
 and complete death.

4:08:48.480 --> 4:08:50.200
 The war had to be total.

4:08:50.200 --> 4:08:53.240
 Before that, under the gold standard,

4:08:54.320 --> 4:08:57.040
 kings would send professional armies

4:08:57.040 --> 4:08:59.760
 to fight each other in battlefields.

4:08:59.760 --> 4:09:02.080
 And as soon as it became clear

4:09:02.080 --> 4:09:04.640
 that one side was establishing an advantage,

4:09:04.640 --> 4:09:09.640
 the fighting would stop and the kings would settle,

4:09:10.400 --> 4:09:12.240
 would agree to new terms.

4:09:12.240 --> 4:09:13.440
 Because it was extremely expensive

4:09:13.440 --> 4:09:16.480
 to build a professional army and you ran out of money.

4:09:16.480 --> 4:09:18.280
 So it was always the smartest thing to do

4:09:18.280 --> 4:09:20.960
 is to just stop fighting whenever you could.

4:09:20.960 --> 4:09:23.040
 And wars would take place.

4:09:23.040 --> 4:09:25.360
 Countries would fight each other in the battlefield.

4:09:25.360 --> 4:09:28.160
 But in the cities, life went on as normal.

4:09:28.160 --> 4:09:30.000
 And people within the same cities,

4:09:30.000 --> 4:09:31.640
 within the cities of the two countries

4:09:31.640 --> 4:09:33.720
 would be trading with one another.

4:09:33.720 --> 4:09:35.440
 Life would go on, but the war would be there.

4:09:35.440 --> 4:09:40.440
 And it was just an independent part of politics

4:09:40.440 --> 4:09:43.360
 that all right, we have a problem over this piece of land.

4:09:43.360 --> 4:09:45.640
 Let's take it outside.

4:09:45.640 --> 4:09:48.120
 We don't fight in the civilian areas.

4:09:48.120 --> 4:09:49.520
 We go to the battlefield.

4:09:49.520 --> 4:09:50.960
 We fight with professional armies.

4:09:50.960 --> 4:09:53.360
 And in fact, sometimes the conflicts would be,

4:09:53.360 --> 4:09:55.160
 the armies would line up

4:09:55.160 --> 4:09:58.520
 and they would just have a small contingent

4:09:58.520 --> 4:10:00.120
 of the two armies fight with one another.

4:10:00.120 --> 4:10:02.560
 And as soon as one of them establishes an advantage,

4:10:02.560 --> 4:10:06.560
 then all right, well, you won, let's move on with it.

4:10:07.480 --> 4:10:09.760
 Governments were far, far, far more careful

4:10:09.760 --> 4:10:14.480
 about their monetary policy and their, sorry,

4:10:14.480 --> 4:10:17.120
 their war policy when they couldn't print their money.

4:10:17.120 --> 4:10:19.160
 And that has changed with Fiat.

4:10:19.160 --> 4:10:22.400
 And that has allowed this new emergence of this class

4:10:22.400 --> 4:10:24.480
 of what I like to call chicken hawks

4:10:24.480 --> 4:10:26.240
 of people who sit in offices

4:10:26.240 --> 4:10:28.960
 like the entire foreign policy establishment

4:10:28.960 --> 4:10:30.800
 in Washington, DC.

4:10:30.800 --> 4:10:32.600
 People who have never fought in war,

4:10:32.600 --> 4:10:34.640
 whose children will never fight a war,

4:10:34.640 --> 4:10:36.640
 who'll never pay to fight a war,

4:10:36.640 --> 4:10:39.320
 who'll never suffer a broken window

4:10:39.320 --> 4:10:41.280
 in their house because of war,

4:10:41.280 --> 4:10:45.160
 sitting there and based on these fucking moronic garbage

4:10:45.160 --> 4:10:48.080
 that they teach at moronic Fiat universities

4:10:48.080 --> 4:10:50.120
 about politics and geopolitics,

4:10:50.120 --> 4:10:52.920
 making decisions about, we need to invade that country

4:10:52.920 --> 4:10:54.080
 and we need to send war there.

4:10:54.080 --> 4:10:56.040
 And they can do that because they have

4:10:56.040 --> 4:10:57.880
 this endless money printer.

4:10:57.880 --> 4:11:01.080
 And that's why, back under gold,

4:11:01.080 --> 4:11:05.040
 if you were a warrior, you went and actually joined the war.

4:11:05.040 --> 4:11:08.920
 And that, the people who pontificated about war

4:11:08.920 --> 4:11:10.520
 were the people who had experience with war,

4:11:10.520 --> 4:11:13.160
 the people who were sending their own children to war,

4:11:13.160 --> 4:11:15.400
 the people who were fighting with their own money.

4:11:15.400 --> 4:11:18.280
 Now you have all these fat parasitics come

4:11:18.280 --> 4:11:20.240
 sitting in Washington, DC deciding,

4:11:20.240 --> 4:11:21.880
 and Washington is just an example,

4:11:21.880 --> 4:11:23.720
 but all over the world this exists.

4:11:23.720 --> 4:11:24.680
 People who have never fought,

4:11:24.680 --> 4:11:26.360
 who'll never carry the consequences,

4:11:26.360 --> 4:11:29.560
 are going to devalue the world's money

4:11:29.560 --> 4:11:32.760
 in order to go and have other people's children

4:11:32.760 --> 4:11:35.640
 fight each other because of stupid garbage

4:11:35.640 --> 4:11:39.240
 they learned about politics in university.

4:11:40.760 --> 4:11:44.360
 You said you value low time preference,

4:11:44.360 --> 4:11:48.160
 but I have news for you, that one day you will die,

4:11:48.160 --> 4:11:50.240
 as far as we know, you're a mortal being.

4:11:51.200 --> 4:11:52.560
 Do you think about your death?

4:11:52.560 --> 4:11:54.320
 Do you think about your mortality?

4:11:55.240 --> 4:11:56.400
 Are you afraid of it?

4:11:57.920 --> 4:12:02.560
 I've spent a lot of time introspecting

4:12:02.560 --> 4:12:03.680
 and thinking about these things,

4:12:03.680 --> 4:12:06.080
 and I value life a lot.

4:12:06.080 --> 4:12:08.320
 I value my time on earth a lot,

4:12:08.320 --> 4:12:11.280
 and you'll see this in my dealings with people.

4:12:12.280 --> 4:12:15.360
 Go back to Twitter, why am I so brash and straightforward?

4:12:15.360 --> 4:12:17.440
 It really is because life is short.

4:12:17.440 --> 4:12:19.120
 Because I don't want to waste,

4:12:19.120 --> 4:12:24.120
 I think on my, I've said this before,

4:12:25.080 --> 4:12:27.600
 on my tombstone, let it be written.

4:12:27.600 --> 4:12:30.720
 He never let anyone waste his time twice in his life.

4:12:32.040 --> 4:12:33.360
 His life is short.

4:12:33.360 --> 4:12:35.000
 Yeah, you can waste my time once,

4:12:35.000 --> 4:12:36.280
 you can get me to do something,

4:12:36.280 --> 4:12:37.680
 and then I realize that was a waste of time,

4:12:37.680 --> 4:12:39.760
 you will never get me to waste my time twice.

4:12:39.760 --> 4:12:42.880
 And so you show up in my Twitter with something stupid,

4:12:42.880 --> 4:12:45.440
 you're never showing up in my Twitter ever again.

4:12:45.440 --> 4:12:47.640
 You give people a chance, but you're a fast learner.

4:12:47.640 --> 4:12:50.760
 Yeah, and I try and use my time very wisely,

4:12:50.760 --> 4:12:52.840
 and I'm unapologetic about it.

4:12:52.840 --> 4:12:54.320
 My time is the most precious thing,

4:12:54.320 --> 4:12:58.400
 and the way to get on my shit list forever

4:12:58.400 --> 4:13:02.240
 is to try and take away my time and to abuse my time.

4:13:02.240 --> 4:13:07.240
 If you do that, it's the one unforgivable sin for me.

4:13:08.720 --> 4:13:11.600
 And I think that's really, I think that's my way

4:13:11.600 --> 4:13:13.040
 of coming to terms with mortality.

4:13:13.040 --> 4:13:15.640
 We're all gonna die, and so let's make the most out of it

4:13:15.640 --> 4:13:16.640
 while we're still here.

4:13:16.640 --> 4:13:18.000
 And of course, the other way you come to terms

4:13:18.000 --> 4:13:19.760
 with mortality is you have children.

4:13:21.240 --> 4:13:26.000
 Given what you just said, doubly so,

4:13:26.000 --> 4:13:27.600
 it's a huge honor that you would spend

4:13:27.600 --> 4:13:29.480
 your valuable time with me.

4:13:29.480 --> 4:13:30.920
 This is the first time you did it,

4:13:30.920 --> 4:13:32.840
 so you probably regret all of it,

4:13:32.840 --> 4:13:35.200
 so we'll probably never see each other again.

4:13:35.200 --> 4:13:38.280
 But I'm glad you at least took the chance to do it.

4:13:38.280 --> 4:13:39.280
 It's a huge honor, man.

4:13:39.280 --> 4:13:40.880
 I've been a huge fan of yours.

4:13:40.880 --> 4:13:44.160
 I think you have impact on the world

4:13:44.160 --> 4:13:46.000
 that you probably are not even aware of.

4:13:46.000 --> 4:13:49.160
 It's tremendous, and a lot of people love you,

4:13:49.160 --> 4:13:50.280
 and your work is important.

4:13:50.280 --> 4:13:53.560
 Even, you know, I disagree with some things you say,

4:13:53.560 --> 4:13:55.080
 and there's people that disagree with you,

4:13:55.080 --> 4:13:57.000
 but everybody respects you.

4:13:57.000 --> 4:13:58.240
 And thank you so much for spending

4:13:58.240 --> 4:14:00.120
 your really valuable time with me today, brother.

4:14:00.120 --> 4:14:01.680
 Thank you, sir, really appreciate it.

4:14:01.680 --> 4:14:02.720
 This was not a waste of time,

4:14:02.720 --> 4:14:04.800
 and I'd be happy to do it again.

4:14:04.800 --> 4:14:06.360
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

4:14:06.360 --> 4:14:07.760
 with Savedina Moose.

4:14:11.520 --> 4:14:13.680
 And now, let me leave you with some words

4:14:13.680 --> 4:14:16.520
 from the Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek.

4:14:17.440 --> 4:14:19.920
 Economic control is not merely control

4:14:19.920 --> 4:14:21.480
 of a sector of human life

4:14:21.480 --> 4:14:23.480
 which can be separated from the rest.

4:14:23.480 --> 4:14:27.640
 It is the control of the means for all our ends.

4:14:27.640 --> 4:14:31.640
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
