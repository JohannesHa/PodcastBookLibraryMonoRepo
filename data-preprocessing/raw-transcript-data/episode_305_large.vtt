00:00.000 --> 00:05.600
 no reason to think that the ocean ends just beyond your horizon. And likewise, there's no reason to

00:05.600 --> 00:12.800
 think that the aftermath of our Big Bang ends just at the boundary of what we can see. Indeed,

00:12.800 --> 00:17.280
 there are quite strong arguments that it probably goes on about 100 times further.

00:18.080 --> 00:24.800
 It may even go on so much further that all combinatorials are replicated. And there's

00:24.800 --> 00:32.160
 another set of people like us sitting in a room like this. The following is a conversation with

00:32.160 --> 00:38.080
 Lord Martin Rees, Emeritus Professor of Cosmology and Astrophysics at Cambridge University and

00:38.080 --> 00:43.840
 co founder of the Center for the Study of Existential Risk. This is the Lex Friedman

00:43.840 --> 00:48.560
 podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now,

00:48.560 --> 00:55.280
 dear friends, here's Martin Rees. In your 2020 Scientific American article,

00:55.280 --> 01:00.960
 you write that, quote, today we know that the universe is far bigger and stranger than anyone

01:00.960 --> 01:07.200
 suspected. So what do you think are the strangest, maybe the most beautiful, or maybe even the most

01:07.200 --> 01:13.600
 terrifying things lurking out there in the cosmos? Well, of course, we're still groping for any

01:13.600 --> 01:19.680
 detailed understanding of the remote parts of the universe. But of course, what we've learned in the

01:19.680 --> 01:25.760
 last few decades is really two things. First, we've understood that the universe had an origin

01:26.400 --> 01:33.120
 about 13.8 billion years ago, in a so called Big Bang, a hot 10 states, whose very beginnings are

01:33.120 --> 01:39.680
 still shrouded in mystery. And also, we've learned more about the extreme things in it, black holes,

01:39.680 --> 01:46.720
 neutron stars, explosions of various kinds. And one of the most potentially exciting discoveries

01:46.720 --> 01:53.360
 in the last 20 years, mainly in the last 10, has been the realization that most of the stars in the

01:53.360 --> 02:00.160
 sky are orbited by retinues of planets, just as the Sun is orbited by the Earth and the other

02:00.160 --> 02:05.360
 familiar planets. And this, of course, makes the night sky far more interesting. What you see up

02:05.360 --> 02:10.320
 there aren't just points of light, but they're planetary systems. And that raises the question,

02:10.320 --> 02:15.840
 could there be life out there? And so that is an exciting problem for the 21st century.

02:15.840 --> 02:21.760
 So when you see all those lights out there, you immediately imagine all the planetary worlds that

02:21.760 --> 02:29.360
 are around them, and they potentially have all kinds of different lives, living organisms,

02:29.360 --> 02:32.640
 life forms or different histories. Well, that we don't know at all. We know

02:32.640 --> 02:39.760
 that these planets are there. We know that they have masses and orbits rather like the

02:39.760 --> 02:44.880
 planets of our solar system. But we don't know at all if there's any life on any of them. I mean,

02:44.880 --> 02:50.160
 it's entirely logically possible that life is unique to this Earth, doesn't exist anywhere.

02:50.160 --> 02:56.080
 On the other hand, it could be that the origin of life is something which happens routinely given

02:56.080 --> 03:00.800
 conditions like the young Earth, in which case there could be literally billions of places in

03:00.800 --> 03:07.680
 our galaxy where some sort of biosphere has evolved. And settling where the truth lies

03:07.680 --> 03:11.680
 between those two extremes is a challenge for the coming decades.

03:12.720 --> 03:18.880
 So certainly we're either lucky to be here or very, very, very lucky to be here.

03:18.880 --> 03:25.280
 I guess that's the difference. Where do you fall? Your own estimate,

03:25.280 --> 03:29.200
 your own guess on this question. Are we alone in the universe, do you think?

03:29.200 --> 03:35.360
 I think we're foolish to give any firm estimate because we just don't know. And that's just an

03:35.360 --> 03:40.880
 example of how we are depending on greater observations. And also, incidentally,

03:40.880 --> 03:47.120
 in the case of life, we've got to take account of the fact that, as I always say to my scientific

03:47.120 --> 03:54.080
 colleagues, biology is a much harder subject than physics. And most of the universe that we know

03:54.080 --> 03:59.680
 about could be understood by physics. But we've got to remember that even the smallest living

03:59.680 --> 04:08.400
 organism, an insect, is far more complicated with layer on layer complexity than the most

04:08.400 --> 04:13.280
 complicated star or galaxy. That's the funny thing about physics

04:13.280 --> 04:19.920
 and biology. The dream of physicists in the 20th century and maybe this century is to discover

04:19.920 --> 04:27.760
 the theory of everything. And there's a sense that once you discover that theory,

04:27.760 --> 04:32.160
 you will understand everything. If we unlock the mysteries of how the universe works,

04:32.160 --> 04:39.680
 would you be able to understand how life emerges from that fabric of the universe that we understand?

04:39.680 --> 04:45.840
 I think the phrase, theory of everything, is very misleading because it's used to describe

04:45.840 --> 04:52.080
 a theory which unifies the three laws of microphysics, electricity,

04:52.080 --> 04:57.920
 magnetism, and weak interaction with gravity. So it's an important step forward for particle

04:57.920 --> 05:04.400
 physicists. But the lack of such a theory doesn't hold up any other scientists. Anyone doing

05:04.400 --> 05:10.240
 biology or most of physics is not held up at all through not understanding subnuclear physics.

05:10.240 --> 05:12.880
 They're held up because they're dealing with things that are very complicated.

05:12.880 --> 05:18.720
 And that's especially true of anything biological. So what's holding up biologists is not a lack of

05:18.720 --> 05:23.920
 the so called theory of everything. It's the inability to understand things which are very

05:23.920 --> 05:30.000
 complicated. What do you think we'll understand first? How the universe works or how the human

05:30.000 --> 05:36.800
 body works deeply, like from a fundamental deep level? Well, I think, perhaps we can come back to

05:36.800 --> 05:44.800
 it later, that there are only limited prospects of ever being able to understand with unaided human

05:44.800 --> 05:51.120
 brains the most fundamental theories linking together all the forces of nature. I think that

05:51.120 --> 05:58.960
 may be a limitation of the human brains. But I also think that we can, perhaps aided by computer

05:58.960 --> 06:06.640
 simulations, understand a bit more of the complexity of nature. But even understanding a

06:06.640 --> 06:15.040
 simple organism from the atom up is very, very difficult. And I think extreme reductionists have

06:15.040 --> 06:20.960
 a very misleading perception. They tend to think that, in a sense, we are all solutions to

06:20.960 --> 06:28.000
 Schrodinger's equation, etc. But that isn't the way we'll ever understand anything. It may be true

06:28.000 --> 06:34.960
 that we are reductionists in the sense that we believe that that's the case. We don't believe in

06:34.960 --> 06:40.240
 any special life force in living things. But nonetheless, no one thinks that we can understand

06:40.240 --> 06:46.320
 a living thing by solving Schrodinger's equation. To take an example which isn't as complicated,

06:46.320 --> 06:52.720
 lots of people study the flow of fluids like water, why waves break, why flows go turbulent,

06:52.720 --> 06:59.120
 things like that. This is a serious branch of applied mathematics and engineering. And in doing

06:59.120 --> 07:06.000
 this, you have concepts of viscosity, turbulence, and things like that. Now, you can understand

07:06.000 --> 07:13.280
 quite a lot about how water behaves and how waves break in terms of those concepts. But the fact

07:13.280 --> 07:20.320
 that any breaking wave is a solution of Schrodinger's equation for 10 to the 30 particles,

07:20.320 --> 07:26.080
 even if you could solve that, which you clearly can't, would not give you any insight.

07:26.080 --> 07:30.560
 So the important thing is that every science has its own irreducible concepts

07:32.080 --> 07:37.840
 in which you get the best explanation. So it may be in chemistry, it's things like valence.

07:38.720 --> 07:47.280
 In biology, there are concepts in cell biology. And in ecology, there are concepts like

07:47.280 --> 07:54.800
 imprinting, etc. And in psychology, there are other concepts. So in a sense, the sciences are

07:55.520 --> 08:01.920
 like a tall building where you have basic physics, most fundamental, then the rest of

08:01.920 --> 08:08.160
 physics, then chemistry, then cell biology, etc., all the way up to the, I guess, economist in the

08:08.160 --> 08:15.920
 penthouse and all that. And we have that. And that's true in a sense. But it's not true that

08:15.920 --> 08:23.600
 it's like a building in that it's made unstable by an unstable base. Because if you're a chemist,

08:23.600 --> 08:27.040
 biologist, or an economist, you're facing challenging problems.

08:27.760 --> 08:32.240
 But they're not made any worse by uncertainty about subnuclear physics.

08:33.120 --> 08:37.840
 TK And at every level, just because you understand the rules of the game,

08:37.840 --> 08:40.720
 or have some understanding of the rules of the game, doesn't

08:40.720 --> 08:46.160
 TK mean you know what kind of beautiful things that game creates.

08:46.160 --> 08:55.200
 TK Right. So if you're interested in birds and how they fly, then things like imprinting

08:56.240 --> 09:01.920
 the baby on the mother and all that, and things like that, are what you need to understand.

09:02.800 --> 09:08.160
 You couldn't even in principle solve this fairly good equation, how an albatross

09:08.160 --> 09:12.400
 wanders for thousands of miles in the Southern Ocean and comes back and then coughs up

09:12.400 --> 09:15.920
 food for its young. That's something we can understand, in a sense,

09:16.480 --> 09:21.360
 and predict the behavior. But it's not because we can solve it on the atomic scale.

09:21.360 --> 09:25.840
 TK You mentioned that there might be some fundamental limitation to the human brain

09:26.720 --> 09:32.080
 that limits our ability to understand some aspect of how the universe works. That's really

09:32.080 --> 09:39.600
 interesting. That's sad, actually. To the degree it's true, it's sad. So what do you mean by that?

09:39.600 --> 09:46.000
 TK I would simply say that just as a monkey can't understand quantum theory or even Newtonian

09:46.000 --> 09:52.400
 physics, there's no particular reason why the human brain should have evolved to be well matched

09:52.400 --> 09:59.120
 to understanding the deepest aspects of reality. And I suspect that there may be aspects that we

09:59.120 --> 10:02.720
 are not even aware of and couldn't really fully comprehend.

10:03.280 --> 10:07.200
 But as an intermediate step towards that, one thing which I think is a very interesting

10:07.200 --> 10:13.840
 possibility is the extent to which AI can help us. I mean, I think if you take the example of

10:14.640 --> 10:17.520
 so called theories of everything, one of which is string theory.

10:18.480 --> 10:24.880
 String theory involves very complicated geometry and structures in 10 dimensions.

10:24.880 --> 10:35.040
 And it's certainly, in my view on the cards, that the physics of 10 dimensions,

10:36.480 --> 10:41.680
 very complicated geometry, may be too hard for a human being to work through,

10:42.400 --> 10:50.640
 but could be worked through by an AI with the advantage of the huge processing power,

10:50.640 --> 10:55.600
 which enables them to learn world championship chess within a few hours just by watching games.

10:55.600 --> 11:02.800
 So there's every reason to expect that these machines could help us to solve these problems.

11:02.800 --> 11:08.000
 And of course, if that's the way we came to understand whether string theory was right,

11:08.000 --> 11:13.120
 it should be in a sense frustrating because you wouldn't get the sort of aha insight,

11:13.120 --> 11:19.040
 which is the greatest satisfaction from doing science. But on the other hand, if a machine

11:19.040 --> 11:26.560
 churns away at 10 dimensional geometry, figuring out all the possible origamis wound up in extra

11:26.560 --> 11:32.960
 dimensions, if it comes out at the end, spews out the correct mass of the electron, the fact that

11:32.960 --> 11:36.960
 there are three kinds of neutrinos, something like that, you would know that there was some truth in

11:36.960 --> 11:43.200
 the theory. And so we may have a theory which we come to trust because it does predict things that

11:43.200 --> 11:49.760
 we can observe and check, but we may never really understand the full workings of it to the extent

11:49.760 --> 11:57.840
 that we do more or less understand how most phenomena can be explained in a fundamental way.

11:57.840 --> 12:00.400
 Of course, in the case of quantum theory, many people would say,

12:01.120 --> 12:04.640
 understand if there's still some mystery, if you don't quite understand why it works.

12:04.640 --> 12:09.200
 But there could be deeper mysteries when we get to these unified theories, where there's a big gap

12:09.200 --> 12:16.560
 between what a computer can print out for us at the end and what we can actually grasp and think

12:16.560 --> 12:21.280
 through in our heads. Yeah, it's interesting that the idea that there could be things a computer

12:21.280 --> 12:29.040
 could tell us that is true. And maybe it can even help us understand why it's true a little bit,

12:29.040 --> 12:34.400
 but ultimately it's still a long journey to really deeply understand the whys of it.

12:34.400 --> 12:40.800
 Yes, and that's the limitation of our brain. We can try to sneak up to it in different ways,

12:40.800 --> 12:45.680
 given the limitations of our brain. I've gotten a chance to spend the day at DeepMind,

12:45.680 --> 12:52.320
 talk to Demis Hassabis. His big dream is to apply AI to the questions of science,

12:52.320 --> 12:55.840
 certainly to the questions of physics. Have you gotten a chance to interact with him?

12:55.840 --> 12:59.520
 Well, I know him quite well. He's one of my heroes, certainly.

12:59.520 --> 13:02.080
 I'm sure he would say the same.

13:02.080 --> 13:07.280
 And I remember the first time I met him, he said that he was like me, he wants to understand the

13:07.280 --> 13:12.880
 universe, but he thought the best thing to do was to try and develop AI. And then with the help of

13:12.880 --> 13:17.360
 AI, he'd stand more chance of understanding the universe. And I think he's right about that.

13:18.080 --> 13:26.640
 And of course, although we're familiar with the way his computers play go and chess,

13:26.640 --> 13:33.040
 he's already made contributions to science through understanding protein folding better

13:33.040 --> 13:40.240
 than the best human chemists. And so already he's on the path to showing ways in which computers

13:40.240 --> 13:45.840
 have the power to learn and do things by having ability to analyze enormous samples in a short

13:45.840 --> 13:52.240
 time to do better than humans. And so I think he would resonate for what I just said, that it may

13:52.240 --> 13:57.280
 be that in these other fundamental questions, the computers will play a crucial role.

13:58.080 --> 14:02.720
 Yeah. And they're also doing a quantum mechanical simulation of electrons. They're doing

14:03.600 --> 14:07.760
 control of high temperature plasmas, fusion reactors.

14:07.760 --> 14:11.520
 Yes, that's a new thing, which is very interesting. They can suppress the instabilities

14:11.520 --> 14:14.880
 in these tokamaks better than any other way. Yeah.

14:14.880 --> 14:24.720
 And it's just the march of progress by AIs in science is making big strides. Do you think

14:24.720 --> 14:28.800
 an AI system will win a Nobel Prize in the century? What do you think?

14:31.520 --> 14:33.520
 And does that make you sad?

14:33.520 --> 14:38.240
 If I can digress and put in a plug for my next book, it has a chapter saying,

14:38.240 --> 14:43.760
 why Nobel Prizes do more harm than good. So on a quite separate subject, I think

14:43.760 --> 14:49.120
 the Nobel Prizes do a great deal of damage to the perception of the way science is done.

14:49.120 --> 14:53.760
 Of course, if you ask who or what deserves the credit for any scientific discovery,

14:53.760 --> 14:58.960
 it may be often someone who has an idea, a team of people who work a big experiment, etc.

14:59.600 --> 15:07.360
 And of course, it's the quality of the equipment, which is crucial. And certainly in the subjects

15:07.360 --> 15:15.120
 I do in astronomy, the huge advances we've had come not from us being more intelligent than

15:15.120 --> 15:22.240
 Aristotle was, but through us having far, far better data from powerful telescopes on the

15:22.240 --> 15:29.040
 ground and in space. And also, incidentally, we've benefited hugely in astronomy from computer

15:29.040 --> 15:36.960
 simulations. Because if you are a subatomic physicist, then of course, you crash together

15:36.960 --> 15:43.280
 the particles in the big accelerator like the one at CERN and see what happens. But I can't

15:43.280 --> 15:48.880
 crash together two galaxies or two stars and see what happens. But in the virtual world of a

15:48.880 --> 15:56.160
 computer, one can do simulations like that. And the power of computers is such that these

15:56.160 --> 16:05.840
 simulations can yield phenomena and insights which we wouldn't have guessed beforehand. And the way

16:05.840 --> 16:11.280
 we can feel we're making progress and trying to understand some of these phenomena, why galaxies

16:11.280 --> 16:16.880
 have the size and shape they do and all that, is because we can do simulations and tweaking

16:16.880 --> 16:22.560
 different initial conditions and seeing which gives the best fit to what we actually observe.

16:22.560 --> 16:30.720
 And so that's a way in which we've made progress in using computers. And incidentally, we also now

16:30.720 --> 16:34.880
 need to analyze data because one thinks of astronomy as being traditionally rather data

16:34.880 --> 16:43.840
 poor subjects. But the European satellite called Gaia has just put online the speeds and colors

16:43.840 --> 16:50.560
 and properties of nearly two billion stars in the Milky Way, which we can do fantastic analyses of.

16:50.560 --> 16:54.320
 And that, of course, could not be done at all without just the number crunching capacity

16:54.320 --> 17:01.280
 of computers. And the new methods of machine learning actually love raw data, the kind that

17:01.280 --> 17:06.640
 astronomy provides, organized, structured, raw data. Well, indeed, because the reason they really

17:06.640 --> 17:12.720
 have a benefit over us is that they can learn and think so much faster. That's how they can

17:12.720 --> 17:17.920
 learn to play chess and go. That's how they can learn to diagnose lung cancer better than a

17:17.920 --> 17:26.400
 radiologist because they can look at 100,000 scans in a few days, whereas no human radiologist sees

17:26.400 --> 17:33.040
 that many a lifetime. Well, there's still magic to the human intelligence, to the intuition,

17:33.040 --> 17:40.480
 to the common sense reasoning. Well, we hope so. For now. What is the new book that you mentioned?

17:40.480 --> 17:44.880
 The book I mentioned is called If Science is to Save Us. It's coming out in September.

17:44.880 --> 17:56.560
 And it's on the big challenges of science, climate, dealing with biosafety and dealing

17:56.560 --> 18:03.840
 with cyber safety. And also, it's got chapters on the way science is organized, universities

18:03.840 --> 18:12.560
 and academies, et cetera, and the ethics of science and education. And the limits, yes.

18:12.560 --> 18:18.080
 Yes. Well, let me actually just stroll around the beautiful and the strange of the universe.

18:18.960 --> 18:24.800
 Over 20 years ago, you hypothesized that we would solve the mystery of dark matter by now.

18:25.760 --> 18:34.320
 So unfortunately, we didn't quite yet. First, what is dark matter and why has it been so tough

18:34.320 --> 18:39.520
 to figure out? Well, I mean, we learned that galaxies and other large scale structures,

18:39.520 --> 18:50.720
 which are moving around but preventive of flying apart by gravity, would be flying apart if they

18:50.720 --> 18:57.520
 only contain the stuff we see, if everything in them is shining. And to understand how galaxies

18:57.520 --> 19:06.000
 formed and why they do remain confined the same size, one has to infer that there's about five

19:06.000 --> 19:12.720
 times as much stuff producing gravitational forces than the total amount of stuff in the

19:12.720 --> 19:18.960
 gas and stars that we see. And that stuff is called dark matter. That's the leading name,

19:18.960 --> 19:26.560
 it's not dark, it's just transparent, et cetera. And the most likely interpretation is that it's

19:26.560 --> 19:34.480
 a swarm of microscopic particles which have no electric charge. And the very small cross sections

19:34.480 --> 19:39.680
 were hitting each other and hitting anything else. So they swarm around and we can detect their

19:39.680 --> 19:44.880
 collective effects. And when we do computer simulations of how galaxies form and evolve

19:45.680 --> 19:52.240
 and how they emerge from the Big Bang, then we get a nice consistent picture if we put in

19:53.680 --> 20:01.520
 five times as much mass in the form of these mysterious dark particles. And for instance,

20:01.520 --> 20:05.840
 it works better if we think they're not interacting particles than if you think they're a gas which

20:05.840 --> 20:09.760
 would have shockwaves and things. So we know something about the properties of these, but we

20:09.760 --> 20:16.400
 don't know what they are. And the disappointment compared to my guess 20 years ago is that

20:17.120 --> 20:21.440
 particles answering this description have not yet been found. It was thought that the

20:21.440 --> 20:26.000
 big accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, which is the world's biggest,

20:26.000 --> 20:30.560
 might have found a new class of particles which would have been the obvious candidates.

20:30.560 --> 20:38.160
 And it hasn't. And some people say, well, dark matter can't be there, etc. But what I would argue

20:38.160 --> 20:44.800
 is that there's a huge amount of parameter space that hasn't been explored. There are other kinds

20:44.800 --> 20:49.920
 of particles called axions which behave slightly differently, which are good candidates. And

20:50.640 --> 20:58.000
 there's a factor of 10 powers of 10 between the heaviest particles that could be created by

20:58.000 --> 21:03.680
 the Large Hadron Collider and the heaviest particles which on theoretical grounds could exist

21:04.560 --> 21:09.920
 without turning into black holes. So there's a huge amount of possible particles which could be

21:09.920 --> 21:16.160
 out there as remnants of the Big Bang, but which we wouldn't be able to detect so easily. So the

21:16.160 --> 21:22.320
 fact that we've got new constraints on what the dark matter could be doesn't diminish my belief

21:22.320 --> 21:27.120
 that it's there in the form of particles because we've only explored a small fraction of parameter

21:27.120 --> 21:35.680
 space. So there's this search, you're literally, upon an unintended, are searching in the dark

21:36.480 --> 21:41.360
 here in this giant parameter space of possible particles. You're searching for, I mean,

21:41.360 --> 21:46.240
 there could be all kinds of particles. There could be, and there's some which may be very,

21:46.240 --> 21:53.920
 very hard to detect. But I think we can hope for some new theoretical ideas because one point which

21:53.920 --> 21:58.000
 perhaps we'd like to discuss more is about the very early stages of the Big Bang.

21:58.800 --> 22:05.600
 And the situation now is that we have an outline picture for how the universe has evolved from

22:06.160 --> 22:12.640
 the time when it was expanding in just a nanosecond up to the present. And we could do

22:12.640 --> 22:20.880
 that because after nanosecond, the physics of the material is in the same range that we can test in

22:20.880 --> 22:27.920
 the lab. After a nanosecond, the particles move around like those in the Large Hadron Collider.

22:27.920 --> 22:34.000
 If you wait for one second, they're rather like in the centers of the hottest stars. And nuclear

22:34.000 --> 22:38.720
 reactions produce hydrogen, helium, et cetera, which fit the data. So we can with confidence

22:38.720 --> 22:43.200
 extrapolate back to when the universe was a nanosecond old. Indeed, I think we can do it with

22:43.200 --> 22:47.760
 as much confidence as anything a geologist tells you about the early history of the Earth.

22:47.760 --> 22:56.080
 And that's huge progress in the last 50 years. But any progress puts in sharper focus new mysteries.

22:56.080 --> 23:02.880
 And of course, the new mysteries in this context are, why is the universe expanding the way it is?

23:02.880 --> 23:09.680
 Why does it contain this mixture of atoms and dark matter and radiation? And why does it have

23:10.480 --> 23:15.040
 the properties which allow galaxies to form, being fairly smooth but not completely smooth?

23:15.040 --> 23:21.440
 And the answer to those questions, I generally believe, to lie in a much, much earlier stage

23:21.440 --> 23:27.840
 of the universe, when conditions were much more extreme, and therefore far beyond the stage where

23:27.840 --> 23:33.440
 we have the foothold in experiments. Very theoretical. And so we don't have a convincing

23:33.440 --> 23:38.320
 theory. We just have ideas. Until we have something like string theory or some other

23:38.320 --> 23:44.400
 clues to the ultra early universe, that's going to remain speculative. So there's a big gap.

23:44.400 --> 23:50.880
 And to say how big the gap is, if we take the observable universe out of a bit more than 10

23:50.880 --> 23:57.840
 billion light years, then when the universe was a nanosecond old, that would have been squeezed down

23:57.840 --> 24:05.360
 to the size of our solar system, or compressed into that volume. But the times we're talking

24:05.360 --> 24:11.600
 about when the key properties of the universe were first imprinted were times when that entire

24:11.600 --> 24:18.000
 universe was squeezed down to the size of a tennis ball, or baseball if you prefer, and it emerged

24:18.000 --> 24:23.280
 from something microscopic. So it's a huge extrapolation. And it's not surprising that,

24:24.000 --> 24:30.400
 since it's so far from our experimental range of detectability, we are still groping for ideas.

24:30.400 --> 24:38.400
 TG But you think first theory will reach into that place, and then experiment will perhaps

24:38.400 --> 24:42.560
 one day catch up, maybe simulation. JG Well, I think in a sense it's a combination. I think

24:43.360 --> 24:50.720
 what we hope for is that there'll be a theory which applies to the early universe,

24:51.760 --> 25:00.400
 which also has consequences which we can test in our present day universe, like discovering

25:00.400 --> 25:05.200
 why neutrinos exist or things like that. And that's the thing which, as I mentioned,

25:05.200 --> 25:11.200
 we may perhaps need a bit of AI to help us to calculate. But I think the hope would be

25:11.760 --> 25:18.000
 that we will have a theory which applies under the very, very extreme early stages of the universe,

25:18.000 --> 25:23.440
 but which gains credibility and gains confidence, because it also manages to account for otherwise

25:23.440 --> 25:29.040
 unexplained features of the low energy world, what people call the standard model of particle

25:29.040 --> 25:35.680
 physics, where there are lots of undetermined numbers. So it may help with that. TG So we're

25:35.680 --> 25:42.640
 dancing between physics and philosophy a little bit, but what do you think happened before the

25:42.640 --> 25:49.200
 Big Bang? So this feels like something that's out of the reach of science. JG It's out of the reach

25:49.200 --> 25:55.920
 of present science, because science develops and as the front is advanced, then new problems come

25:55.920 --> 26:00.240
 into focus that couldn't even have been postulated before. I mean, if I think of my own career,

26:00.240 --> 26:07.120
 when I was a student, the evidence for the Big Bang was pretty weak, whereas now it's extremely

26:07.120 --> 26:13.760
 strong. But we are now thinking about the reason why the universe is the way it is and all that.

26:14.400 --> 26:21.120
 So I would put all these things we've just mentioned in the category of speculative science.

26:21.120 --> 26:27.760
 And I don't see a bifurcation between that and philosophy. But of course, to answer your question,

26:29.200 --> 26:33.440
 if we do want to understand the very early universe, then we've got to realize that

26:34.080 --> 26:40.320
 it may involve even more counterintuitive concepts than quantum theory does, because it's a

26:40.320 --> 26:47.120
 condition even further away from everyday world than quantum theory is. And remember, our lives,

26:47.120 --> 26:55.200
 our brains evolved and haven't changed much since our ancestors roamed the African savanna and

26:55.200 --> 27:00.160
 looked at the everyday world. And it's rather amazing that we've been able to make some sense

27:00.160 --> 27:06.000
 of the quantum micro world and of the cosmos. But there may be some things which are beyond us. And

27:06.000 --> 27:11.520
 certainly, as you implied, there are things that we don't yet understand at all. And of course,

27:11.520 --> 27:18.320
 one concept we might have to jettison is the idea of three dimensions of space and time just ticking

27:18.320 --> 27:24.800
 away. There are lots of ideas. I mean, I think Stephen Hawking had an idea. They're talking about

27:26.880 --> 27:30.960
 what happened before the Big Bang. It's like asking what happens if you go north from the

27:30.960 --> 27:37.040
 North Pole. It somehow closes off. That's just one idea. I don't like that idea, but that's a

27:37.040 --> 27:44.880
 possible one. And so we just don't know what happened at the very beginning of the Big Bang,

27:45.440 --> 27:53.280
 were there many Big Bangs rather than one, etc. And those are issues which we may be able to

27:53.840 --> 28:04.080
 get some foothold on from some new theory. But even then, we won't be able to directly

28:04.080 --> 28:10.880
 test the theories. But I think it's a heresy to think you have to be able to test every prediction

28:10.880 --> 28:16.960
 of a theory. Let me give you another example. We take seriously what Einstein's theory says

28:16.960 --> 28:23.120
 about the inside of black holes, even though we can't observe them, because that theory has been

28:23.120 --> 28:28.880
 vindicated in many other places in cosmology and black holes, gravitational waves, and all those

28:28.880 --> 28:36.160
 things. Likewise, if we had a theory which explains some things about the early history

28:36.160 --> 28:43.440
 of our Big Bang and the present universe, then we would take seriously the inference if it

28:43.440 --> 28:48.400
 predicted many Big Bangs, not one, even though we can't predict the other ones. So the example is

28:49.040 --> 28:54.880
 we can take seriously a prediction if it's the consequence of a theory that we believe

28:54.880 --> 29:00.880
 on other grounds. We don't need to be able to detect another Big Bang in order to take it

29:00.880 --> 29:08.560
 seriously. It may not be a proof, but it's a good indication that this is the direction where the

29:08.560 --> 29:14.400
 truth lies. Yeah, if the theory is getting confidence in other ways. Where do you sense?

29:14.400 --> 29:20.800
 Do you think there's other universes besides our own? There are sort of well defined theories which

29:20.800 --> 29:26.800
 make assumptions about the physics at the relevant time, and this time, incidentally,

29:26.800 --> 29:33.520
 is 10 to the power minus 36 seconds or earlier than that, so this tiny sliver of time.

29:34.720 --> 29:41.360
 There are some theories, a famous one due to Andrei Linde, the Russian cosmologist now at

29:41.360 --> 29:48.640
 Stanford, called eternal inflation, which did predict an eternal production of new Big Bangs,

29:48.640 --> 29:54.800
 as it were, and that's based on specific assumptions about the physics. But those

29:54.800 --> 29:59.840
 assumptions, of course, are just hypotheses which aren't vindicated. But there are other

29:59.840 --> 30:06.480
 theories which only predict one Big Bang. So I think we should be open minded and not dogmatic

30:06.480 --> 30:12.880
 about these options until we do understand the relevant physics. But there are these different

30:12.880 --> 30:19.920
 scenarios of very different ideas about this. But I think all of them have the feature that

30:19.920 --> 30:24.800
 physical reality is a lot more extensive than what we can see through our telescope. I think

30:24.800 --> 30:31.280
 even most conservative astronomers would say that because we can see out with our telescopes to a

30:31.280 --> 30:38.800
 sort of horizon, which is about, depending on how you measure it, maybe 15 billion light years away

30:38.800 --> 30:45.840
 or something like that. But that horizon of observations is no more physical reality than

30:45.840 --> 30:53.760
 the horizon around you if you're in the ocean and looking out at your horizon. There's no reason to

30:53.760 --> 30:58.800
 think that the ocean ends just beyond your horizon. And likewise, there's no reason to think that

30:59.360 --> 31:05.600
 the aftermath of our Big Bang ends just at the boundary of what we can see. Indeed,

31:05.600 --> 31:10.080
 there are quite strong arguments that it probably goes on about 100 times further.

31:10.880 --> 31:17.600
 It may even go on so much further that all combinatorials are replicated. And there's

31:17.600 --> 31:26.640
 another set of people like us sitting in a room like this. That's not logically impossible.

31:27.520 --> 31:35.040
 But I think many people would accept that it does go on and contain probably a million times

31:35.040 --> 31:40.240
 as much stuff as what we can see within a horizon. The reason for that, incidentally,

31:40.240 --> 31:44.000
 is that if we look as far as we can in one direction and in the opposite direction,

31:44.960 --> 31:50.640
 then the conditions don't differ by more than one part in 100,000. So that means that if we're part

31:50.640 --> 31:56.400
 of some finite structure, the gradient across the part we can see is very small. And so that

31:56.400 --> 32:01.440
 suggests that it probably does go on a lot further. And the best estimates say it must

32:01.440 --> 32:07.520
 go on at least 20 times further. LR – Is that exciting or terrifying to you?

32:07.520 --> 32:13.600
 Just the spans of it all, the wide, everything that lies beyond the horizon.

32:15.360 --> 32:20.080
 That example doesn't even hold for Earth, so it goes way, way farther. And on top of that,

32:20.080 --> 32:25.840
 just to take your metaphor further on the ocean, while we're on top of this ocean,

32:25.840 --> 32:31.760
 not only can we not see beyond the horizon, we also don't know much about the depth of the ocean,

32:31.760 --> 32:36.560
 nor the actual mechanism of observation that's in our head.

32:36.560 --> 32:59.360
 RL – I don't think the perception of this utterly vast cosmos need have any deeper impact

32:59.360 --> 33:04.000
 on us than just realizing that we are very small on the scale of the external world.

33:04.000 --> 33:13.120
 LR – Yeah, it's humbling though. It's humbling, depending where your ego is, it's humbling.

33:13.120 --> 33:17.680
 RL – Well, if you start off very unhumble indeed, it may make a difference. But for most of us,

33:17.680 --> 33:22.720
 I don't think it makes much of a difference. Well, there's a more general question, of course,

33:22.720 --> 33:34.400
 about whether the human race as such is something which is very special, or if on the other hand,

33:34.400 --> 33:42.080
 it's just one of many such species elsewhere in the universe, or indeed existing at different

33:42.080 --> 33:48.160
 times in our universe. LR – To me, it feels almost obvious

33:48.160 --> 33:53.920
 that the universe should be full of alien life, perhaps dead alien civilizations, but

33:54.560 --> 34:04.160
 just the vastness of space. And it just feels wrong to think of Earth as somehow special. It

34:04.160 --> 34:09.680
 sure as heck doesn't look that special. The more we learn, the less special it seems.

34:09.680 --> 34:16.560
 RL – Well, I mean, I don't agree with that as far as life is concerned, because remember that

34:16.560 --> 34:22.240
 we don't understand how life began here on Earth. We don't understand, although we know there were

34:22.240 --> 34:28.160
 any evolution of simple life to complex life, we don't understand what caused the transition

34:28.160 --> 34:34.880
 between complex chemistry and the first replicating, metabolizing entity we call alive.

34:35.360 --> 34:42.720
 That's a mystery, and serious physicists and chemists are now thinking about it,

34:42.720 --> 34:50.400
 but we don't know. So we therefore can't say, was it a rare fluke which would not have happened

34:50.400 --> 34:57.200
 anywhere else, or was it something which involves a process that would have happened in any other

34:57.200 --> 35:04.080
 planet where conditions were like they were on the young Earth? So we can't say that now. I think

35:04.880 --> 35:11.920
 many of us would indeed bet that probably some kind of life exists elsewhere. But even if you

35:11.920 --> 35:18.320
 accept that, then there are many contingencies going from simple life to present day life.

35:18.960 --> 35:24.720
 Some biologists like Stephen Jay Gould thought that if you reround evolution,

35:24.720 --> 35:28.800
 you'd end up with something quite different, and maybe not with an intelligent species. So

35:28.800 --> 35:34.880
 the contingencies in evolution may militate against the emergence of intelligence,

35:35.520 --> 35:40.320
 even if life gets started in lots of places. So I think these are still completely open questions,

35:40.320 --> 35:45.120
 and that's why it's such an exciting time now that we are starting to be able to address these.

35:45.120 --> 35:51.680
 I mentioned the fact that the origin of life is a question that we may be able to understand,

35:52.720 --> 35:56.720
 and serious people are working on it. It used to be put in a sort of too difficult box. Everyone

35:56.720 --> 36:00.240
 knew it was important, but they didn't know how to tackle it or what experiments to do.

36:00.240 --> 36:06.240
 But it's not like that now. That's partly because of clever experiments, but I think most

36:06.240 --> 36:13.120
 importantly because we are aware that we can look for life in other places, other places in our

36:13.120 --> 36:20.240
 solar system, and of course, on the exoplanets around other stars. And within 10 or 20 years,

36:20.800 --> 36:25.840
 I think two things could happen, which would be really, really important. We might,

36:25.840 --> 36:32.960
 with the next big telescope, be able to image some of the Earth like planets around other stars.

36:32.960 --> 36:36.240
 TG. Image, like get a picture?

36:36.240 --> 36:40.640
 MR. Well, actually, caveat that, it'd take 50 years to get a resolved image,

36:41.600 --> 36:47.280
 but try to detect the light. Because now, of course, these exoplanets are detected by their

36:47.280 --> 36:52.720
 effects on the parent star. They either cause their parent star to dim slightly when they

36:52.720 --> 36:58.880
 transit across in front of it, and so we see the dips, or their gravitational pull makes the star

36:58.880 --> 37:05.440
 wobble a bit. So most of the 5,000 plus planets that have been found around other stars, they've

37:05.440 --> 37:09.440
 been found indirectly by their effect in one of those two ways on the parent star.

37:09.440 --> 37:13.600
 TG. You can still do a pretty good job estimating size, all those kinds of things.

37:13.600 --> 37:22.160
 MR. The size and the mass, you can estimate. But detecting the actual light from one of these

37:22.160 --> 37:27.600
 exoplanets hasn't really been done yet, except for one or two very bright, big planets.

37:27.600 --> 37:29.360
 TG. So maybe like James Webb Telescope.

37:29.360 --> 37:35.120
 MR. Well, James Webb may do this, but even better will be the European ground based telescope

37:36.000 --> 37:42.480
 called Unimaginatively Extremely Large Telescope, which has a 39 meter diameter mirror. 39 meters,

37:42.480 --> 37:49.920
 a mosaic of eight hundred sheets of glass, and that will collect enough light from one of these

37:49.920 --> 37:57.760
 exoplanets around a nearby star to be able to separate out its light from that of the star,

37:57.760 --> 38:03.280
 which is millions of times brighter, and get the spectrum of the planet and see if it's got

38:03.280 --> 38:11.600
 oxygen or chlorophyll and things in it. So that will come. James Webb may make some steps there.

38:11.600 --> 38:18.240
 But I think we can look forward to learning quite a bit in the next 20 years, because I like to say,

38:18.240 --> 38:24.320
 supposing that aliens were looking at the solar system. Then they'd see the sun as an ordinary

38:24.320 --> 38:31.120
 star. They'd see the Earth as, in Carl Sagan's nice phrase, a pale blue dot lying very close in

38:31.120 --> 38:38.400
 the sky to its star, our sun, and much, much, much fainter. But if they could observe that dot,

38:38.960 --> 38:44.320
 they could learn quite a bit. They could perhaps get the spectrum of the light and find the

38:44.320 --> 38:49.120
 atmosphere. They'd find the shade of blue was slightly different, depending on whether the

38:49.120 --> 38:54.720
 Pacific Ocean or the land mass of Asia was facing them, so they could infer the length of the day

38:54.720 --> 38:59.200
 and the ocean and continents, and maybe something about the seasons and the climate.

39:00.800 --> 39:08.160
 That's the kind of calculation and inference we might be able to draw within the next 10 or 20

39:08.160 --> 39:16.560
 years about other exoplanets. Evidence of some sort of biosphere on one of them would, of course,

39:16.560 --> 39:22.080
 be crucial, and it would rule out the still logical possibility that life is unique.

39:22.080 --> 39:26.080
 But there's another way in which this may happen in the next 20 years. People think there could be

39:26.080 --> 39:33.600
 something swimming under the ice of Europa and Enceladus, and probes are being sent to maybe not

39:33.600 --> 39:39.360
 quite go under the ice but detect the spray coming out to see if there's evidence for organics in

39:39.360 --> 39:47.360
 that. And if we found any evidence for an origin of life that had happened in either of those

39:47.360 --> 39:54.640
 places, that would immediately be important. Because if life has originated twice independently

39:54.640 --> 39:59.280
 in one planetary system, the solar system, that would tell us straight away it wasn't a rare

39:59.280 --> 40:05.920
 accident and must have happened billions of times in the galaxy. At the moment, we can't rule out

40:05.920 --> 40:11.600
 it being unique. And incidentally, if we found life on Mars, then that would still be ambiguous

40:11.600 --> 40:18.080
 because people have realized that this early life could have got from Mars to Earth or vice versa

40:18.080 --> 40:24.480
 on meteorites. So if you found life on Mars, then some skeptics could still say if it's a single

40:24.480 --> 40:31.360
 origin. But I think that's far enough away statistically. So that's why that would be

40:31.360 --> 40:38.560
 especially... It's always the skeptics that ruin a good party. But we need them, of course. We need

40:38.560 --> 40:44.800
 them at the party. We need some skeptics at the party. But boy, would that be so exciting to find

40:44.800 --> 40:52.160
 life on one of the moons. Because it means that life is everywhere. That'll just be any kind of

40:52.160 --> 40:58.160
 vegetation or life. The question of the aliens of science fiction is a different matter.

40:58.160 --> 41:05.200
 LW. Intelligent aliens. Yeah, but if you have a good indication that there's life elsewhere in

41:05.200 --> 41:15.040
 the solar system, that means life is everywhere. I don't know if that's terrifying or what that is.

41:15.040 --> 41:22.000
 Because if life is everywhere, why is intelligent life not everywhere? You've talked about that

41:22.000 --> 41:29.040
 most likely alien civilizations, if they are out there, they would likely be far ahead of us.

41:29.760 --> 41:38.800
 The ones that would actually communicate with us. And that, again, one of those things is both

41:38.800 --> 41:44.080
 exciting and terrifying. You've mentioned that they're likely not to be of biological nature.

41:44.080 --> 41:51.840
 MR. Well, I think that's important. Of course, again, it's speculation. But in speculating about

41:51.840 --> 41:59.200
 intelligent life, and I take the search seriously. In fact, I chair the committee that the Russian

41:59.200 --> 42:05.280
 American investor Yuri Milner supports looking for intelligent life. He's putting $10 million

42:05.840 --> 42:11.120
 a year into better equipment and getting time on telescopes to do this. And so I think it's

42:11.120 --> 42:17.440
 worthwhile, even though I don't hold my breath for success. It's very exciting. But that does

42:18.000 --> 42:24.480
 lead me to wonder what might be detected. And I think, well, we don't know. We've got to be

42:24.480 --> 42:28.800
 open minded about anything. We have no idea what it could be. And so any anomalous objects,

42:28.800 --> 42:34.000
 or even some strange shiny objects in the solar system, or anything we've got to keep our eyes

42:34.000 --> 42:44.240
 open for. But I think if we ask about a planet like the Earth, where evolution had taken more

42:44.240 --> 42:51.120
 of the same track, then, as you say, it wouldn't be synchronized. If it had lagged behind, then,

42:51.120 --> 42:57.840
 of course, it would not have got to advanced life. But it may have had a head start. It may

42:57.840 --> 43:04.960
 have formed on a planet around an older star. But then let's ask what we would see. It's taken

43:04.960 --> 43:10.800
 nearly four billion years from the first life to us. And we now got this technological civilization

43:11.600 --> 43:21.840
 which could make itself detectable to any aliens out there. But I think most people would say

43:21.840 --> 43:29.280
 that this civilization of flesh and blood creatures in a collective civilization may not last more

43:29.280 --> 43:38.960
 than a few hundred years more. I think that some people would say it will kill itself off. But I'm

43:38.960 --> 43:47.200
 more optimistic. And I would say that what we're going to have in future is no longer the slow

43:47.200 --> 43:53.920
 Darwinian selection. But we're going to have what I call secular intelligent design, which will be

43:54.640 --> 44:01.680
 humans designing their progeny to be better adapted to where they are.

44:02.640 --> 44:09.280
 And if they go to Mars or somewhere, they're badly adapted and they want to adapt a lot.

44:09.280 --> 44:15.760
 And so they will adapt. But there may be some limits to what could be done with flesh and blood.

44:15.760 --> 44:23.840
 And so they may become largely electronic, download their brains and be electronic entities.

44:23.840 --> 44:29.120
 And if they're electronic, then what's important is that they're near immortal.

44:30.640 --> 44:36.240
 And also, they won't necessarily want to be on a planet with an atmosphere or gravity. They may

44:36.240 --> 44:41.200
 go off into the blue yonder. And if they're near immortal, they won't be daunted by interstellar

44:41.200 --> 44:51.200
 travel taking a long time. And so if we looked at what would happen on the Earth in the next

44:51.200 --> 44:58.320
 millions of years, then there may be these electronic entities, which have been sent out

44:58.320 --> 45:04.640
 and are now far away from the Earth, but still sort of burping away in some fashion to be detected.

45:04.640 --> 45:13.920
 And so this therefore leads me to think that if there was another planet which had evolved like

45:13.920 --> 45:19.680
 the Earth and was ahead of us, it wouldn't be synchronized, so we wouldn't see a flesh and

45:19.680 --> 45:26.240
 blood civilization, but we would see these electronic progeny, as it were. And then this

45:26.240 --> 45:33.600
 raises another question, because there's the famous argument against there being lots of

45:33.600 --> 45:38.720
 aliens out there, which is that they would come and invade us and eat us or something like that.

45:39.600 --> 45:45.280
 That's a common idea, which Fermi is attributed to have been the first to say.

45:46.160 --> 45:53.200
 And I think there's an escape clause to that, because these entities would be

45:54.800 --> 45:59.920
 evolved by second intelligent design, designed by their predecessors and then designed by us.

45:59.920 --> 46:11.120
 Whereas Darwinian selection requires two things. It requires aggression and intelligence. This

46:11.120 --> 46:16.960
 future intelligent design may favor intelligence, because that's what they were designed for,

46:16.960 --> 46:23.760
 but it may not favor aggression. And so these future entities, they may be sitting deep thoughts,

46:23.760 --> 46:30.880
 they're thinking deep thoughts, and not being at all expansionist. So they could be out there.

46:32.240 --> 46:38.000
 And we can't refute their existence in the way the Fermi paradox is supposed to refute their

46:38.000 --> 46:41.520
 existence, because these would not be aggressive or expansionist.

46:41.520 --> 46:46.880
 Well, maybe evolution requires competition, not aggression. And I wonder if competition

46:46.880 --> 46:53.040
 can take forms that are non expansionary. So you can still have fun competing in the space

46:53.040 --> 46:56.240
 of ideas, which maybe primarily...

46:56.240 --> 46:57.760
 The Darwin philosophers, perhaps, yeah.

46:59.440 --> 47:07.040
 In a way, right. It's an intellectual exercise versus a sort of violent exercise.

47:07.840 --> 47:14.640
 So what does this civilization on Mars look like? So do you think we would more and more

47:15.280 --> 47:20.560
 maybe start with some genetic modification and then move to basically cyborgs,

47:20.560 --> 47:25.920
 increasing integration of electronic systems, computational systems into our bodies and brains?

47:25.920 --> 47:31.920
 This is a theme of my other new book out this year, which is called The End of Astronauts.

47:31.920 --> 47:33.040
 The End of Astronauts.

47:33.040 --> 47:40.320
 It's co written with my old friend and colleague from Berkeley, Don Goldsmith. And it's really

47:40.320 --> 47:48.400
 about the role of human spaceflight versus sort of robotic spaceflight. And just to summarize

47:48.400 --> 47:56.400
 what it says, it argues that the practical case for sending humans into space is getting

47:56.400 --> 48:02.960
 weaker all the time as robots get better and more capable. Robots 50 years ago couldn't

48:02.960 --> 48:08.560
 do anything very much, but now they could assemble big structures on space or in space

48:08.560 --> 48:17.360
 or on the moon, and they could probably do exploration. But present ones on Mars can't

48:17.360 --> 48:24.080
 actually do the geology, but future AI will be able to do the geology and already they

48:24.080 --> 48:31.360
 can dig on Mars. And so if you want to do exploration of Mars, and of course, even more

48:31.360 --> 48:37.840
 of Enceladus or Europa where you could never send humans, we depend on robots. And they're

48:37.840 --> 48:43.760
 far, far cheaper because to send a human to Mars requires feeding them for 200 days on

48:43.760 --> 48:48.000
 the journey there and bringing them back. And neither of those are necessary for robots.

48:48.000 --> 48:54.000
 So the practical case for humans is getting very, very weak. And if humans go, it's only

48:54.000 --> 49:03.360
 as an adventure, really. And so the line in our book is that human spaceflight should

49:03.360 --> 49:12.800
 not be pursued by NASA or public funding agencies because it has no practical purpose, but also

49:12.800 --> 49:18.560
 because it's especially expensive if they do it because they would have to be risk averse

49:19.440 --> 49:25.840
 in launching civilians into space. I can illustrate that by noting that the shuttle

49:27.200 --> 49:35.040
 was launched 135 times and it had two spectacular failures, which each killed the seven people in

49:35.040 --> 49:42.800
 the crew. And it had been mistakenly presented as safe for civilians. And there was a woman

49:42.800 --> 49:46.800
 schoolteacher killed in one of them. It was a big national trauma and they tried to make

49:46.800 --> 49:54.800
 it safer still. But if you launch into space, just the kind of people prepared to accept that

49:54.800 --> 50:00.400
 sort of risk, and of course, test pilots and people who go hang gliding and go to the South

50:00.400 --> 50:06.800
 Pole, et cetera, are prepared to accept a 2% risk at least for a big challenge, then of course,

50:06.800 --> 50:14.560
 you do it more cheaply. And that's why I think human spaceflight should be left to the billionaires

50:16.240 --> 50:22.960
 and their sponsors because then the taxpayers aren't paying and they can launch simply those

50:22.960 --> 50:31.440
 people who are prepared to accept high risks. Space adventure, not space tourism. And we should

50:31.440 --> 50:40.480
 cheer them on. And as regards where they would go, then low Earth orbit, as I suspect, can be done

50:40.480 --> 50:46.640
 quite cheaply in the future. But going to Mars, which is very, very expensive and dangerous for

50:46.640 --> 50:55.360
 humans. The only people who would go would be these adventurers, maybe on one way trip,

50:55.360 --> 51:00.160
 like some of the early polar explorers and Magellan and people like that. And we would

51:00.160 --> 51:07.920
 cheer them on. And I expect and I've ever hoped that by the end of a century, there will be a

51:07.920 --> 51:16.000
 small community of such people on Mars living very uncomfortably, far less comfortably than

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
 at the South Pole or the bottom of the ocean or the top of Everest. But they will be there

51:21.520 --> 51:29.040
 and they won't have a return ticket, but they'll be there. Incidentally, I think it's a dangerous

51:29.040 --> 51:38.640
 illusion to think, as Elon Musk has said, that we can have mass emigration from the Earth to Mars

51:38.640 --> 51:44.960
 to escape the Earth's problems. It's a dangerous illusion because it's far easier to deal with

51:44.960 --> 51:51.520
 climate change on Earth than to terraform Mars to make it probably habitable to humans.

51:51.520 --> 51:56.240
 And so there's no planet B for ordinary risk averse people. But for these crazy adventurers,

51:56.240 --> 52:03.040
 then you can imagine that they would be trying to live on Mars as great pioneers.

52:03.040 --> 52:09.040
 And by the end of a century, then there will be huge advances compared to the present in two

52:09.040 --> 52:16.320
 things. First, in understanding genetics, so as to genetically redesign one's offspring. And

52:16.320 --> 52:23.600
 secondly, to use cyborg techniques to implant something in our brain or indeed think about

52:23.600 --> 52:30.080
 downloading, et cetera. And those techniques will, one hopes, be heavily regulated on Earth on

52:30.080 --> 52:36.000
 prudentials and ethical grounds. And of course, we are pretty well adapted to the Earth, so we

52:36.000 --> 52:41.680
 don't have the incentive to do these things in the way they were there. So our argument is that

52:42.560 --> 52:51.040
 it'll be those crazy pioneers on Mars using all these scientific advances, which will be

52:51.040 --> 52:57.760
 controlled here, away from the regulators, they will transition into a new post human species.

52:58.720 --> 53:04.800
 And so if they do that, and if they transition into something which is electronic,

53:04.800 --> 53:09.600
 eventually, because there may be some limits to the capacity of flesh and blood brains anyways,

53:10.240 --> 53:16.400
 then those electronic entities may not want to stay on a planet like Mars, they may want to go

53:16.400 --> 53:24.400
 away. And so they'll be the precursors of the future evolution of life and intelligence coming

53:24.400 --> 53:29.840
 from the Earth. And of course, there's one point which perhaps astronomers are more aware of than

53:29.840 --> 53:35.840
 most people. Most people are aware that we are the outcome of 4 billion years of evolution.

53:36.800 --> 53:42.160
 Most of them nonetheless, probably think that we humans are somehow the culmination,

53:42.960 --> 53:49.120
 the top of the tree. But yes, no astronomers can believe that because astronomers know

53:49.760 --> 53:56.240
 that the Earth is four and a half billion years old. The sun has been shiny for that length of

53:56.240 --> 54:01.760
 time. But the sun has got 6 billion years more to go before it flares up and engulfs the inner

54:01.760 --> 54:08.160
 planet. So the sun is less than halfway through its life. And the expanding universe goes on far

54:08.160 --> 54:13.040
 longer still, maybe forever. And I like to quote Woody Allen, who said, eternity is very long,

54:13.040 --> 54:19.840
 especially towards the end. So we shouldn't think of ourselves as maybe even the halfway stage

54:19.840 --> 54:27.920
 in the emergence of cosmic complexity. And so these entities who are postcursors,

54:27.920 --> 54:32.960
 they will go beyond the solar system. And of course, even if there's nothing else out there

54:32.960 --> 54:40.800
 already, then they could populate the rest of the galaxy. And maybe eventually meet the others who

54:40.800 --> 54:48.480
 are out there expanding as well. Expanding, populating with expanded capacity for life

54:48.480 --> 54:55.440
 and intelligence, all those kinds of things. Well, they might. But again, all better off.

54:55.440 --> 55:03.600
 We can't conceive what they'd be like. They won't be green men and women with eyes on stalks.

55:03.600 --> 55:08.560
 Maybe something quite different. We just don't know. But there is an interesting question,

55:08.560 --> 55:12.480
 actually, which comes up when I've sometimes spoken to audiences about this topic,

55:12.480 --> 55:17.680
 but the question of consciousness and self awareness. Because going back to philosophical

55:17.680 --> 55:26.720
 questions, whether an electronic robot would be a zombie, or would it be conscious and self aware?

55:27.280 --> 55:34.400
 And I think there's no way of answering this empirically. And some people think that

55:34.400 --> 55:39.680
 consciousness and self awareness is an emergent property in any sufficiently complicated networks

55:39.680 --> 55:44.720
 that they would be. Others say, well, maybe it's something special to the flesh and blood that we're

55:44.720 --> 55:51.600
 made of. We don't know. And in a sense, this may not matter to the way things behave because

55:52.720 --> 55:57.920
 they could be zombies and still behave as though they were intelligent. But I remember

55:59.040 --> 56:06.960
 after one of my talks, someone came up and said, wouldn't it be sad if these future entities,

56:06.960 --> 56:11.680
 which were the main intelligent in the universe, had no self awareness? So there was nothing

56:11.680 --> 56:17.440
 which could appreciate the wonder and mystery of the universe and the beauty of the universe

56:17.440 --> 56:24.880
 in the way that we do. And so it does perhaps affect one's perspective of whether you welcome

56:24.880 --> 56:30.800
 or deplore this possible future scenario, depending on whether you think the future

56:30.800 --> 56:36.800
 post human entities are conscious and have an aesthetic sense or whether they're just zombies.

56:36.800 --> 56:44.640
 And of course, you have to be humble to realize that self awareness may not be the

56:45.360 --> 56:53.920
 highest form of being, that humans have a very strong ego and a very strong sense of identity,

56:54.480 --> 57:00.240
 like personal identity connected to this particular brain. It's not so obvious to me

57:00.240 --> 57:08.800
 that that is somehow the highest achievement of a life form, that maybe this kind of...

57:08.800 --> 57:10.720
 Do you think something collective would be?

57:10.720 --> 57:16.160
 It's possible that, well, I think from an alien perspective, when you look at Earth,

57:17.200 --> 57:24.080
 it's not so obvious to me that individual humans are the atoms of intelligence. It could be the

57:24.080 --> 57:28.320
 entire organism together, the collective intelligence. And so we humans think of

57:28.320 --> 57:33.280
 ourselves as individuals, we dress up, we wear ties and suits, and we'll give each other prizes.

57:33.280 --> 57:39.920
 But in reality, the intelligence, the things we create that are beautiful emerges from our

57:39.920 --> 57:44.960
 interaction with each other. And that may be where the intelligence is, ideas jumping from

57:44.960 --> 57:47.360
 one person to another over generations.

57:47.360 --> 57:54.800
 Yes, but we have experiences where we can appreciate beauty and wonder and all that.

57:54.800 --> 57:58.400
 And a zombie may not have those experiences.

57:59.840 --> 58:04.080
 Yeah, or it may have a very different, a very black and white,

58:04.080 --> 58:10.080
 harsh description of a philosophical zombie that could be just a very different way to experience.

58:13.920 --> 58:18.800
 And, you know, in terms of the explorers that colonize Mars,

58:18.800 --> 58:25.200
 I mean, there's several things I want to mention. One, it's just at a high level. To me,

58:25.200 --> 58:31.120
 that's one of the most inspiring things humans can do, is reach out into the unknown. That's

58:31.120 --> 58:34.640
 in the space of ideas, in the space of science, but also the explorers.

58:34.640 --> 58:35.920
 Yes, no, I agree with that.

58:35.920 --> 58:42.400
 And that inspires people here on Earth more. I mean, it did in their, you know,

58:42.400 --> 58:46.320
 when going to the moon or going out to space in the 20th century, that inspired me.

58:46.320 --> 58:54.160
 I think that also could be used to inspire a generation of new scientists in the 21st century

58:54.160 --> 59:00.160
 by reaching out towards Mars. So in that sense, I think what Elon Musk and others are doing is

59:00.160 --> 59:07.200
 actually quite inspiring. It's not, it's not a recreational thing. It's actually has a deep

59:07.200 --> 59:12.880
 humanitarian purpose of really inspiring the world. And then, you know, I think, you know,

59:12.880 --> 59:22.240
 I don't think Elon says we want to escape Earth's problems. It's more that we should allocate some

59:22.240 --> 59:30.880
 small percentage of resources to have a backup plan. And because you yourself have spoken about

59:30.880 --> 59:35.680
 and written about all the ways we clever humans destroy ourselves.

59:35.680 --> 59:36.320
 You could go on.

59:36.320 --> 59:45.680
 And I'm not sure, it does seem when you look at the long arc of human history, it seems almost

59:45.680 --> 59:51.840
 obvious that we need to become a multi planetary species over a period. If we are to survive many

59:51.840 --> 59:59.440
 centuries, it seems that as we get clever and clever with the ways we can destroy ourselves,

59:59.440 --> 1:00:08.560
 Earth is going to become less and less safe. So in that sense, this is one of the things,

1:00:08.560 --> 1:00:13.040
 you know, people talk about climate change and that we need to respond to climate change. And

1:00:13.040 --> 1:00:19.120
 that's a long term investment we need to make, but it's not really long term. It's a span of decades.

1:00:19.520 --> 1:00:22.800
 I think what Elon is doing is a really long term investment.

1:00:22.800 --> 1:00:29.280
 We should be working on multi planetary colonization now if we were to have it ready

1:00:29.280 --> 1:00:35.440
 five centuries from now. And so taking those early steps. And then also there's something

1:00:35.440 --> 1:00:42.480
 happens when you go into the unknown and do this really difficult thing. You discover

1:00:42.480 --> 1:00:47.520
 something very new. You discover something about robotics. You discover something about

1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:53.680
 materials engineering or nutrition or neuroscience or human relations or political systems that

1:00:53.680 --> 1:00:59.600
 actually work well with humans. You discover all those things. And so it's a worthy effort to go

1:00:59.600 --> 1:01:08.000
 out there and try to become cyborgs. Yeah, no, I agree with that. I think the only different point

1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:17.360
 I'd make is that this is going to be very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

1:01:17.360 --> 1:01:23.920
 very expensive if it's done in a risk averse way. And that's why I think we should be grateful to

1:01:24.480 --> 1:01:32.640
 the billionaires if they're going to sort of foster these opportunities for thrill seeking

1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:38.160
 risk takers who we can all admire. Yeah. By the way, I should push back on the billionaires

1:01:38.160 --> 1:01:41.760
 because there's sometimes a negative connotation to the word billionaire. It's not a billionaire.

1:01:41.760 --> 1:01:46.640
 It's a company versus government because governments are billionaires and trillionaires.

1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:55.360
 Yeah. It's not the wealth. It's the capitalist imperative, which I think

1:01:58.320 --> 1:02:04.240
 deserves a lot more praise than people are giving it. I'm troubled by the sort of criticism like

1:02:04.240 --> 1:02:11.760
 it's billionaires playing with toys for their own pleasure. I think what some of these companies

1:02:11.760 --> 1:02:19.840
 like SpaceX and Blue Origin are doing is some of the most inspiring engineering and even scientific

1:02:19.840 --> 1:02:26.480
 work ever done in human history. No, I agree. I think the people who've made the greatest wealth

1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:30.080
 are people who've really been mega benefactors. I mean, I think, you know.

1:02:31.120 --> 1:02:37.040
 Some of them, some of them. Yeah, yes, some of them. But those who've founded Google and all

1:02:37.040 --> 1:02:44.560
 that and even Amazon, they're beneficiaries. They're in a quite different category, in my view,

1:02:44.560 --> 1:02:52.080
 from those who just shuffle around money or crypto coins and things like that.

1:02:52.080 --> 1:02:54.880
 Now you're really talking trash.

1:02:54.880 --> 1:03:02.800
 Yes. But I think if they use their money in these ways, that's fine. But I think it's true that far

1:03:02.800 --> 1:03:08.160
 more money is owned by us collectively as taxpayers. But I think the fact is that in a democracy,

1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:16.640
 there'd be big resistance to exposing human beings to very high risks if in a sense we

1:03:16.640 --> 1:03:21.920
 share responsibility for it. And that's the reason I think it would be done much more cheaply by

1:03:23.280 --> 1:03:24.560
 these private funders.

1:03:24.560 --> 1:03:29.600
 That's an interesting hypothesis, but I have to push back. I don't know if it's obvious

1:03:29.600 --> 1:03:38.240
 why NASA spends so much money and takes such a long time to develop the things it was doing.

1:03:38.240 --> 1:03:44.160
 So before Elon Musk came along, because I would love to live in a world where government

1:03:44.880 --> 1:03:49.200
 actually uses taxpayer money to get some of the best engineers and scientists in the world

1:03:49.200 --> 1:03:55.040
 and actually work across governments, Russia, China, United States, European Union together

1:03:55.040 --> 1:04:00.960
 to do some of these big projects. It's strange that Elon is able to do this much cheaper,

1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:06.160
 much faster. It could have to do with risk aversion, you're right.

1:04:06.160 --> 1:04:15.600
 But I think it's that he had all the whole assembly within this one building as it were,

1:04:15.600 --> 1:04:22.000
 rather than depending on a supply chain. But I think it's also that he had a Silicon Valley

1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:27.920
 culture and had younger people, whereas the big aerospace companies, Boeing and Lockheed Martin,

1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:33.840
 they had people who were left over from the Apollo program in some cases. And so they weren't

1:04:33.840 --> 1:04:40.000
 quite so lively. And indeed, quite apart from the controversial issues of the future of human

1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:48.000
 spaceflight, in terms of the next generation of big rockets, then the one that Musk is going to

1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:55.200
 launch for the first time this year, the huge one, is going to be far, far cheaper than the

1:04:55.200 --> 1:05:01.680
 one that NASA has been working on at the same time. And that's because it will have a reusable

1:05:01.680 --> 1:05:09.680
 first stage. And it's going to be great. It can launch over 100 tons into Earth orbit. And

1:05:09.680 --> 1:05:14.320
 incidentally, that's going to make it feasible to do things that I used to think were crazy,

1:05:14.320 --> 1:05:20.480
 like having solar energy from space. That's no longer so crazy if you can do that. And also,

1:05:21.200 --> 1:05:31.520
 for science, because its nose cone could contain within it something as big as the entire unfurled

1:05:31.520 --> 1:05:37.440
 James Webb telescope mirror. And therefore, you can have a big telescope much more cheaply if you

1:05:37.440 --> 1:05:43.440
 can launch it all in one piece. And so it's going to be hugely beneficial to science and to any

1:05:43.440 --> 1:05:49.280
 practical use of space to have these cheaper rockets that are far more completely reusable

1:05:49.280 --> 1:05:56.320
 than anyways NASA had. So I think Musk's done a tremendous service to space exploration and the

1:05:56.320 --> 1:06:03.120
 whole space technology through these rockets, certainly. Plus, it's some big sexy rocket.

1:06:03.120 --> 1:06:07.600
 It's just great engineering. Of course, yeah. It's like looking at a beautiful big bridge

1:06:08.160 --> 1:06:12.880
 that humans are capable. Us descendants of apes are capable to do something so majestic.

1:06:12.880 --> 1:06:16.800
 Yes. And also the way they land coming down on this bar. That's amazing.

1:06:16.800 --> 1:06:23.680
 It's both controls engineering. It's increasing sort of intelligence in these rockets, but also

1:06:24.240 --> 1:06:31.440
 great propulsion engineering materials, entrepreneurship. And it just inspires so

1:06:31.440 --> 1:06:38.400
 many people. No, I'm entirely with you on that. So would it be exciting to you to see a human

1:06:38.400 --> 1:06:43.280
 being step foot on Mars in your lifetime? Yes, I think it's unlikely in my lifetime

1:06:43.280 --> 1:06:50.080
 since I'm so ancient. But I think this century, it's going to happen. And I think that will

1:06:50.080 --> 1:06:55.040
 indeed be exciting. And I hope there will be a small community by the end of a century.

1:06:55.040 --> 1:07:03.600
 But as I say, I think they may go with one way tickets or accepting the risk of no return.

1:07:03.600 --> 1:07:10.240
 And so they've got to be people like that. And I still think it's going to be hard to persuade

1:07:10.240 --> 1:07:18.160
 the public to send people when you say straight out that they may never come back. But of course,

1:07:18.160 --> 1:07:25.040
 the Apollo astronauts, they took a high risk. And in fact, in my previous book, I quote the

1:07:25.600 --> 1:07:31.200
 speech that has been written for Nixon to be read out if Neil Armstrong got stuck on the moon.

1:07:31.200 --> 1:07:42.480
 And it was written by one of his advisors and very eloquent speech about how they have come

1:07:42.480 --> 1:07:51.600
 to a noble end, et cetera. But of course, there was a genuine risk at that time. But that may have

1:07:51.600 --> 1:07:59.200
 been accepted. But clearly, the crashes of the shuttle were not acceptable to the American

1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:05.280
 public, even when they were told that this was only a 2% risk given how often they launched it.

1:08:05.280 --> 1:08:13.760
 And so that's what leads me to think that it's got to be left to the kind of people who are

1:08:13.760 --> 1:08:19.520
 prepared to take these risks. And I think of American Avengers, there was a guy called Steve

1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:25.600
 Fossett who was an aviator who did all kinds of crazy things. And then a guy who fell

1:08:25.600 --> 1:08:32.640
 supersonically with a parachute from very high altitude. All these people, we all share them on.

1:08:32.640 --> 1:08:39.360
 They extend the bounds of humanity. But I don't think the public will be so happy to fund them.

1:08:39.360 --> 1:08:44.640
 I mean, I disagree with that. I think if we change the narrative, we should change the story.

1:08:44.640 --> 1:08:45.200
 You think so?

1:08:45.200 --> 1:08:53.760
 I think there's a lot of people... Because the public is happy to fund folks in other domains

1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:57.600
 that take bold, giant risks. First of all, military, for example.

1:08:57.600 --> 1:08:59.600
 Oh, in the military, obviously, yes.

1:08:59.600 --> 1:09:05.200
 I think this is, in the name of science, especially if it's sold correctly, I sure as hell would go

1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:12.480
 up there with a risk... I would take a 40% chance risk of death for something that's...

1:09:12.480 --> 1:09:17.600
 I would. I might want to be even older than I am now. But then I would go.

1:09:17.600 --> 1:09:22.400
 I guess what I'm trying to communicate is there's a lot of people on Earth. That's the nice feature

1:09:22.400 --> 1:09:27.360
 and I'm sure there's going to be a significant percentage or some percentage of people that are...

1:09:27.360 --> 1:09:36.240
 They take on the risk for the adventure. So, and I particularly love that that risk of adventure

1:09:36.240 --> 1:09:40.960
 when taking on inspires people and just the ripple effect it has across the generation,

1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:50.880
 especially among the young minds, is perhaps immeasurable. But you're thinking that sending

1:09:50.880 --> 1:09:56.880
 humans should be something we do less and less, sending humans to space. That it should be

1:09:56.880 --> 1:10:03.680
 primarily an effort. The work of space exploration should be done primarily by robots.

1:10:03.680 --> 1:10:09.600
 Well, I think it can be done much more cheaply, obviously, on Mars. And no one's thinking of

1:10:09.600 --> 1:10:18.000
 sending humans to Enceladus or Europa, the outer planets. And the point is we will have much better

1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:27.920
 robots. Because let's take an example. You've seen the pictures of the moons of Saturn and the

1:10:27.920 --> 1:10:37.520
 picture of Pluto and the comet taken by probes and Cassini spent 13 years going around Saturn and

1:10:37.520 --> 1:10:43.040
 its moons after seven year voyage. And those are all based on 1990s technology. And if you think

1:10:43.040 --> 1:10:47.600
 of how smartphones have advanced in the 20 years since then, just think how much better one could

1:10:47.600 --> 1:10:54.160
 do instrumenting some very small, sophisticated probe. You could send dozens of them to explore

1:10:54.160 --> 1:10:58.960
 the outer planets. And that's the way to do that. Because no one thinks you could send humans that

1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:07.040
 far. But I would apply the same argument to Mars. And if you want to assemble big structures like,

1:11:07.760 --> 1:11:12.240
 for instance, radio astronomers would like to have a big radio telescope on the far side of the moon

1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:19.920
 so it's away from the Earth's background artificial radio waves. And that could be

1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:28.240
 done by assembling using robots without people. So on the moon and on Mars, I think

1:11:29.520 --> 1:11:34.320
 everything that's useful can be done by machines much more cheaper than by humans.

1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:39.120
 Do you know the movie 2001 A Space Odyssey?

1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:43.840
 Of course, yes. You must be too young to have seen that when it came out, obviously.

1:11:44.720 --> 1:11:45.920
 I remember seeing it when it came out.

1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:48.000
 You saw it when it came out.

1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:50.640
 Yeah, yeah, 50 years ago.

1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:54.960
 60, when was it? 60, in the 60s.

1:11:54.960 --> 1:11:57.120
 Yeah, that's right. Still a classic.

1:11:58.240 --> 1:12:03.280
 It's still probably, for me, the greatest AI movie ever made.

1:12:03.280 --> 1:12:04.720
 Yes, yes, I agree.

1:12:04.720 --> 1:12:06.720
 One of the great space movies ever made.

1:12:06.720 --> 1:12:12.240
 Yes. Well, let me ask you a philosophical question. Since we're talking about robots

1:12:12.240 --> 1:12:19.680
 exploring space, do you think HAL 9000 is good or bad? So for people who haven't watched,

1:12:20.800 --> 1:12:28.720
 this computer system makes a decision to basically prioritize the mission that

1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:37.360
 the ship is on over the humans that are part of the mission. Do you think HAL is good or evil?

1:12:38.160 --> 1:12:43.040
 If you ask me, probably in that context, it was probably good. But I think you're raising

1:12:43.040 --> 1:12:50.640
 what is, of course, very much an active issue in everyday life about the extent to which we should

1:12:50.640 --> 1:12:57.760
 entrust any important decision to a machine. And there again, I'm very worried, because I think

1:12:58.560 --> 1:13:06.960
 if you are recommended for an operation or not given parole from prison or even denied credit

1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:13.920
 by your bank, you feel you should be entitled to an explanation. It's not enough to be told that

1:13:13.920 --> 1:13:20.720
 the machine has a more reliable record on the whole than humans have of making these decisions.

1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:26.560
 You think you should be given reasons you could understand. And that's why I think the present

1:13:26.560 --> 1:13:37.360
 societal trend to take away the humans and leave us in the hands of decisions that we can't contest

1:13:37.360 --> 1:13:44.480
 is a very dangerous one. I think we've got to be very careful of the extent to which AI,

1:13:44.480 --> 1:13:48.880
 which can handle lots of information, actually makes the decision without oversight. And I think

1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:57.840
 we can use them as a supplement. But to take the case of radiology and cancer,

1:13:57.840 --> 1:14:08.160
 I mean, it's true that the radiologist hasn't seen as many x rays of cancer lungs as the machine. So

1:14:08.160 --> 1:14:12.400
 the machine could certainly help, but you want the human to make the final decision. And I think

1:14:12.400 --> 1:14:18.800
 that's true in most of these instances. But if we turn a bit to the short term concerns with

1:14:19.360 --> 1:14:27.120
 robotics, I think the big worry, of course, is the effect it has on people's self respect and

1:14:27.120 --> 1:14:35.200
 their labor market. And I think my solution would be that we should arrange to tax more heavily

1:14:36.080 --> 1:14:46.000
 the big international conglomerates, which use the robots and use that tax to fund

1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:54.000
 decently paid, dignified posts of the kind where being a human being is important.

1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:59.520
 Above all, carers for old people, teachers assistants for young, gardens in public parks,

1:14:59.520 --> 1:15:05.920
 and things like that. And if the people who are now working in mind numbing jobs in Amazon

1:15:05.920 --> 1:15:15.120
 warehouses, or in telephone call centers, are automated, but those same people are given

1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:22.320
 jobs where being a human is an asset, then that's a plus plus situation. And so that's

1:15:22.320 --> 1:15:30.480
 the way I think that we should benefit from these technologies, take over the mind numbing jobs,

1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:40.800
 and use machines to make them more efficient, but enable the people so displaced to do jobs

1:15:40.800 --> 1:15:46.720
 where we do want a human being. I mean, most people when they're old, they're rich people

1:15:46.720 --> 1:15:51.440
 if they have the choice. They want human carers and all that, don't they? They may want robots

1:15:51.440 --> 1:15:57.680
 to help with some things, empty the bed pans and things like that, but they want real people. And

1:15:59.760 --> 1:16:06.400
 certainly in this country, I think even worse in America, the care of old people is completely

1:16:06.400 --> 1:16:11.360
 inadequate. And it needs just more human beings to help them cope with everyday life and look after

1:16:11.360 --> 1:16:19.360
 them when they're sick. And so that seems to be the way in which the money raised in tax from

1:16:19.360 --> 1:16:24.240
 these big companies should be deployed. So that's in the short term, but if you actually just look,

1:16:24.240 --> 1:16:30.480
 the fact is where we are today to longterm future in a hundred years, it does seem that

1:16:31.520 --> 1:16:37.840
 there is some significant chance that the human species is coming to an end in its

1:16:39.200 --> 1:16:43.680
 pure biological form. There's going to be greater and greater integration

1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:50.800
 through genetic modification and cyborg type of creatures. And so you have to think, all right,

1:16:50.800 --> 1:16:56.080
 well, we're going to have to get from here to there and that process is going to be painful.

1:16:56.080 --> 1:17:01.680
 And there's so many different trajectories that take us from one place to another.

1:17:02.400 --> 1:17:09.840
 It does seem that we need to deeply respect humanness and humanity, basic human rights,

1:17:09.840 --> 1:17:14.880
 human welfare, like happiness and all that kind of stuff.

1:17:14.880 --> 1:17:20.240
 No, absolutely. And that's why I think we ought to try and slow down the application of these

1:17:20.240 --> 1:17:25.360
 human enhancement techniques and cyborg techniques for humans for just that reason. I mean,

1:17:26.560 --> 1:17:32.320
 that's why I want to lead into the people on Mars, let them do it, but for just that reason.

1:17:32.320 --> 1:17:37.360
 But there are people too. Okay. People on Mars are people too. I tend to, you know.

1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:42.800
 But they are very poorly adapted to where they are. That's why they need this modification,

1:17:42.800 --> 1:17:49.200
 whereas we're adapted to the Earth quite well. So we don't need these modifications. We're

1:17:49.200 --> 1:17:54.800
 happy to be humans living in the environment where our ancestors lived. So we don't have the same

1:17:55.520 --> 1:18:00.480
 motive. So I think there's a difference. But I agree, we don't want drastic changes probably in

1:18:01.040 --> 1:18:06.480
 our lifestyle. And that indeed is a worry because some things are changing so fast.

1:18:06.480 --> 1:18:13.760
 But I think I'd like to inject a note of caution. If you think of the way progress in one technology

1:18:13.760 --> 1:18:21.040
 goes, it goes in a sort of spurt. It goes up very fast and then it levels off. Let me give you

1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:28.400
 two examples. One we've had already, a human space flight. At the time of the Apollo program,

1:18:28.400 --> 1:18:35.920
 which was only 12 years after Sputnik 1, I was alive then. And I thought it would only be 10

1:18:35.920 --> 1:18:41.600
 or 20 years further before there were footprints on Mars. But as we know, for reasons we could all

1:18:41.600 --> 1:18:50.560
 understand, that still remains the high point of human space exploration. That's because it was

1:18:50.560 --> 1:18:57.600
 funded for reasons of superpower rivalry at huge public expense. But let me give you another case,

1:18:57.600 --> 1:19:05.200
 civil aviation. If you think of the change between 1919, when that was Alcock and Brown's first

1:19:05.200 --> 1:19:12.400
 transatlantic fight, to 1979, the first flight of the jumbo jet. It was a big change. But it's more

1:19:12.400 --> 1:19:17.280
 than 50 years since 1969. And we still have jumbo jets more or less the same. So that's an example

1:19:17.280 --> 1:19:24.880
 of something which developed fast. And to take another analogy, we've had huge developments in

1:19:24.880 --> 1:19:30.880
 mobile phones. But I suspect the iPhone 24 may not be too different from the iPhone 13.

1:19:32.880 --> 1:19:39.680
 They develop, but then they saturate, and then maybe some new innovation takes over

1:19:39.680 --> 1:19:47.120
 in stimulating economic growth. Yeah, so it's that we have to be cautious about being too optimistic,

1:19:47.680 --> 1:19:52.160
 and we have to be cautious about being too cynical. I think that is the

1:19:52.160 --> 1:19:56.240
 optimistic is begging the question. I mean, do we want this rapid change?

1:19:56.240 --> 1:20:01.760
 Right. So first of all, there's some degree to which technological advancement is something,

1:20:01.760 --> 1:20:07.120
 is a force that can't be stopped. And so the question is about directing it versus stopping it

1:20:07.680 --> 1:20:11.680
 or slowing it. Well, it can be sort of sloped or slow. We'll take human spaceflight. There could

1:20:11.680 --> 1:20:19.040
 have been footprints on Mars if America had gone on spending 4% of the federal budget on the project

1:20:19.040 --> 1:20:29.600
 after Apollo. There were very good reasons, and we could have had supersonic flight, but Concorde

1:20:29.600 --> 1:20:37.440
 came and went during the 50 years. But the reason it didn't progress is not because we realize it's

1:20:37.440 --> 1:20:41.760
 not good for human society. The reason it didn't progress is because it couldn't make,

1:20:41.760 --> 1:20:47.760
 sort of from a capitalist perspective, it couldn't make, there was no short term or long term way for

1:20:47.760 --> 1:20:52.560
 it to make money. So for me, it isn't, but that's the same as saying it's not good for society.

1:20:54.080 --> 1:20:59.760
 I don't think everything that makes money is good for society and everything that doesn't make money

1:20:59.760 --> 1:21:06.640
 is bad for society, right? That's a difficult thing we're always contending with.

1:21:06.640 --> 1:21:14.800
 That's a difficult thing we're always contending with when we look at social networks. It's not

1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:19.040
 obvious, even though they make a tremendous amount of money, that they're good for society,

1:21:19.040 --> 1:21:23.520
 especially how they're currently implemented with advertisement and engagement maximization.

1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:26.240
 So that's the constant struggle.

1:21:26.240 --> 1:21:38.720
 But I would have thought that supersonic flight was something that would benefit only a tiny

1:21:38.720 --> 1:21:44.480
 elite at a huge expense and environmental damage. That was obviously something which we're very

1:21:44.480 --> 1:21:45.840
 glad not to have, in my opinion.

1:21:46.720 --> 1:21:51.840
 Yeah, but perhaps there was a way to do it where it could benefit the general populace.

1:21:51.840 --> 1:21:56.880
 If you were to think about airplanes, wouldn't you think that in the early days, airplanes would

1:21:56.880 --> 1:22:03.600
 have been seen as something that can surely only benefit 1% at most of the population,

1:22:03.600 --> 1:22:09.520
 as opposed to a much larger percentage? There's another aspect of capitalist system that's able

1:22:09.520 --> 1:22:15.760
 to drive down costs once you get the thing kind of going. So we get together maybe with taxpayer

1:22:15.760 --> 1:22:21.200
 money and get the thing going at first. And once it gets going, companies step up and drive down

1:22:21.200 --> 1:22:26.400
 the cost and actually make it so that blue collar folks can actually start using the stuff.

1:22:26.400 --> 1:22:28.320
 Yeah, sometimes that does happen. That's good.

1:22:29.360 --> 1:22:37.280
 Yeah. So that's, again, the double edged sword of human civilization, that some technology

1:22:37.280 --> 1:22:41.840
 hurts us, some benefits us, and we don't know ahead of time. We can just do our best.

1:22:41.840 --> 1:22:47.760
 Yes. There's a gap between what could be done and what we collectively decide to do.

1:22:49.120 --> 1:22:49.440
 Yes.

1:22:49.440 --> 1:22:55.120
 And it could push forward some developments faster than we do.

1:22:55.120 --> 1:22:59.840
 Let me ask you, in your book on the future prospects for humanity,

1:23:01.280 --> 1:23:05.440
 you imagine a time machine that allows you to send a tweet length message to scientists in

1:23:05.440 --> 1:23:12.160
 the past, like to Newton. What tweet would you send? It's an interesting thought experiment.

1:23:12.160 --> 1:23:15.680
 What message would you send to Newton about what we know today?

1:23:15.680 --> 1:23:22.000
 Well, I think he'd love to know that there were planets around other stars. He'd like to know

1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:29.440
 that everything was made of atoms. He'd like to know that if he looked a bit more carefully

1:23:29.440 --> 1:23:38.400
 through his prisms and looked at light, not just from the sun, but from some flames,

1:23:38.400 --> 1:23:44.320
 he might get the idea that different substances emitted light of different colors, and he might

1:23:44.320 --> 1:23:51.920
 have been twigged to discover some things that had to wait 200 or 300 years. Could have given him

1:23:51.920 --> 1:23:57.760
 those clues, I think. It's fascinating to think, to look back at how little

1:23:59.360 --> 1:24:03.120
 he understood, people at that time understood about our world.

1:24:04.880 --> 1:24:07.280
 Yes. And certainly about the cosmos.

1:24:07.280 --> 1:24:08.880
 About the cosmos, yes.

1:24:08.880 --> 1:24:17.440
 Well, if you think about astronomy, then until about 1850, astronomy was a matter of

1:24:19.280 --> 1:24:25.440
 the positions of how the stars and the planets moved around. Of course, that goes back a long

1:24:25.440 --> 1:24:31.760
 way, but Newton understood why the planets moved around in ellipses. But he didn't understand

1:24:31.760 --> 1:24:39.760
 why the solar system was all in a plane, what we call the ecliptic, and he didn't understand it.

1:24:39.760 --> 1:24:44.400
 No one did until the mid 19th century what the stars are made of. I mean, they were thought to

1:24:44.400 --> 1:24:48.160
 be made of some fifth essence, not earth, air, fire, and water like everything else,

1:24:49.040 --> 1:24:56.640
 and it was only after 1850 when people did use prisms more precisely to get spectra that they

1:24:56.640 --> 1:25:04.960
 realized that the sun was made of the same stuff as the earth, and indeed the stars were. It wasn't

1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:12.480
 until 1930 that people knew about nuclear energy and knew what kept the sun shining for so long.

1:25:12.480 --> 1:25:17.600
 So it was quite late that some of these key ideas came in, which would have completely

1:25:17.600 --> 1:25:25.360
 transformed Newton's views, and of course, the entire scale of the galaxy and the rest of the

1:25:25.360 --> 1:25:30.320
 universe. Just imagine what he would have thought about the Big Bang, or even just general

1:25:30.320 --> 1:25:39.200
 relativity, just gravity, just him and Einstein talking for a couple weeks. Would he be able to

1:25:39.200 --> 1:25:46.240
 make sense of space time and the curvature of space time? Well, I think given a quick course,

1:25:46.240 --> 1:25:51.680
 I mean, he was sort of, if one looks back, he was really a unique intellect in a way,

1:25:51.680 --> 1:26:00.640
 you know, and he said that he thought better than everyone else by thinking on things continually,

1:26:00.640 --> 1:26:06.400
 and thinking very deep thoughts, and so he was an utterly remarkable intellect, obviously.

1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:10.320
 But of course, scientists aren't all like that. I think one thing that's interesting to me,

1:26:10.320 --> 1:26:16.560
 having spent a life among scientists, is what a variety of mindsets and mental styles they have.

1:26:16.560 --> 1:26:30.560
 And just to contrast Newton and Darwin, Darwin said, and he's probably correct, that he thought

1:26:30.560 --> 1:26:38.720
 he just had as much common sense and reasoning power as the average lawyer. And that's probably

1:26:38.720 --> 1:26:45.200
 true because his ability was to sort of collect data and think through things deeply. That's a

1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:50.560
 quite different kind of thinking from what was involved in Newton or someone doing abstract

1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:57.840
 mathematics. I think in the 20th century, the coolest, well, there's the theory, but

1:26:59.200 --> 1:27:08.320
 from an astronomy perspective, black holes is one of the most fascinating entities to have been,

1:27:08.960 --> 1:27:13.680
 through theory and through experiment, to have emerged from. Obviously, I agree. It's an amazing

1:27:13.680 --> 1:27:22.080
 story. Well, of course, what's interesting is Einstein's reaction because, as you know,

1:27:22.080 --> 1:27:27.520
 we now accept this is one of the most remarkable predictions of Einstein's theory. He never took

1:27:27.520 --> 1:27:34.480
 it seriously, even believed it, although it was a consequence of a solution of his equations,

1:27:34.480 --> 1:27:40.640
 which someone discovered just a year after his theory, Schwarzschild. But he never took it

1:27:40.640 --> 1:27:47.600
 seriously, and others did. But then, of course, well, this is something that I've been involved

1:27:47.600 --> 1:27:53.040
 in actually finding evidence for black holes, and that's come in the last 50 years. So now,

1:27:53.040 --> 1:27:58.800
 there's pretty compelling evidence that they exist as the remnants of stars or big ones in

1:27:58.800 --> 1:28:07.120
 the center of galaxies. And we understand what's going on. We have ideas, vaguely on how they form.

1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:14.160
 And, of course, gravitational waves have been detected, and that's an amazing piece of technology.

1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:18.240
 Ligo is one of the most incredible engineering efforts of all time.

1:28:18.240 --> 1:28:23.120
 That's an example where the engineers deserve most of the credit because the precision is,

1:28:23.680 --> 1:28:28.960
 as I said, it's like measuring the thickness of a hair at the distance of Alpha Centauri.

1:28:28.960 --> 1:28:30.320
 Yeah, it's incredible.

1:28:30.320 --> 1:28:31.440
 Tens to minus 21.

1:28:31.440 --> 1:28:36.240
 So maybe, actually, if we step back, what are black holes? What do we humans understand about

1:28:36.240 --> 1:28:39.600
 black holes and what's still unknown?

1:28:40.160 --> 1:28:47.120
 Einstein's theory, extended by people like Roger Penrose, tells us that black holes are,

1:28:47.120 --> 1:28:54.080
 in a sense, rather simple things, basically, because they are solutions of Einstein's equations.

1:28:54.880 --> 1:29:01.280
 And the thing that was shown in the 1960s by Roger Penrose in particular, and by a few other

1:29:01.280 --> 1:29:09.040
 people, was that a black hole, when it forms and settles down, is defined just by two quantities,

1:29:09.040 --> 1:29:14.640
 its mass and its spin. So they're actually very standardized objects. It's amazing that objects

1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:20.560
 as standardized as that can be so big and can lurk in the rest of the solar system.

1:29:20.560 --> 1:29:27.120
 And so that's the situation for a ready formed black hole. But the way they form, obviously,

1:29:27.120 --> 1:29:36.080
 is very messy and complicated. And one of the things that I've worked on a lot is what the

1:29:36.080 --> 1:29:41.600
 phenomena are, which are best attributed to black holes, and what may lead to them, and all that.

1:29:43.040 --> 1:29:46.320
 Which, can you explain to that? So what are the different phenomena

1:29:46.320 --> 1:29:49.920
 that lead to a black hole? Let's talk about it. This is so cool.

1:29:49.920 --> 1:29:56.880
 Oh, okay. Well, I think one thing that only became understood, really,

1:29:56.880 --> 1:30:05.280
 in the 1950s, I suppose, and beyond was how stars evolve differently depending on how

1:30:05.280 --> 1:30:11.360
 heavy they are. The sun burns hydrogen to helium, and then when it's run out of that,

1:30:11.360 --> 1:30:16.160
 it contracts to be a white dwarf. And we know how long that will take. It'll take about 10 billion

1:30:16.160 --> 1:30:23.600
 years altogether for its lifetime. But big stars burn up their fuel more quickly, and more

1:30:23.600 --> 1:30:27.680
 interestingly, because when they've turned hydrogen to helium, they then get even hotter,

1:30:27.680 --> 1:30:33.440
 so they can fuse helium into carbon and go up the periodic table. And then they eventually

1:30:33.440 --> 1:30:38.400
 explode when they have an energy crisis, and they blow out that process material,

1:30:38.400 --> 1:30:43.920
 which, as a digression, is crucially important because all the atoms inside our bodies

1:30:44.880 --> 1:30:50.640
 were synthesized inside a star, a star that lived and died more than five billion years ago

1:30:50.640 --> 1:30:55.920
 before our solar system formed. And so we each have inside us atoms made in thousands of different

1:30:55.920 --> 1:31:00.800
 stars all over the Milky Way, and that's an amazing idea. My predecessor, Fred Hoyle,

1:31:00.800 --> 1:31:05.600
 in 1946 was the first person to suggest that idea, and that's been borne out. That's a wonderful

1:31:05.600 --> 1:31:15.200
 idea. So that's how massive stars explode. And they leave behind something which is very exotic

1:31:15.200 --> 1:31:21.760
 of two kinds. One possibility is a neutron star, and these were first discovered in 1967,

1:31:21.760 --> 1:31:29.040
 68. These are stars a bit heavier than the sun, which are compressed to an amazing density,

1:31:29.040 --> 1:31:34.720
 so the whole mass of more than the sun's mass is in something about 10 miles across.

1:31:34.720 --> 1:31:46.880
 So they're extraordinarily dense, they're exotic physics, and they've been studied in immense

1:31:46.880 --> 1:31:51.360
 detail. And they've been real laboratories because the good thing about astronomy, apart from

1:31:51.920 --> 1:31:57.040
 exploring what's out there, is to use the fact that the cosmos has provided us with a lab

1:31:57.040 --> 1:32:01.040
 with far more extreme conditions than we could ever simulate. And so we learn lots of basic

1:32:01.040 --> 1:32:05.760
 physics from looking at these objects, and that's been true of neutron stars. But for black holes,

1:32:06.320 --> 1:32:14.160
 that's even more true because the bigger stars, when they collapse, they leave something behind

1:32:14.160 --> 1:32:19.040
 in the center which is too big to be a stable white 2 or 4 neutron star and becomes a black hole.

1:32:19.600 --> 1:32:25.520
 And we know that there are lots of black holes weighing about 10 or up to 50 times as much as the

1:32:25.520 --> 1:32:33.840
 sun, which are the remnants of stars. They were detected first 50 years ago, when a black hole

1:32:33.840 --> 1:32:40.240
 was orbiting around another star and grabbing material from the other star which swirled into

1:32:40.240 --> 1:32:48.960
 it and gave us X rays. So the X rays astronomers found these objects orbiting around an ordinary

1:32:48.960 --> 1:32:56.240
 star and emitting X ray radiation very intensely, varying on a very short time scale. So something

1:32:56.240 --> 1:33:00.800
 very small and dense was giving that radiation. That was the first evidence for black holes.

1:33:00.800 --> 1:33:05.680
 But then the other thing that happened was realizing that there was a different class

1:33:05.680 --> 1:33:12.480
 of monster black holes in the centers of galaxies. And these are responsible for what's called

1:33:12.480 --> 1:33:19.680
 quasars, which is when something in the center of a galaxy is grabbing some fuel and outshines all

1:33:19.680 --> 1:33:26.640
 the hundred billion stars or so in the rest of the galaxy. A giant beam of light. And in many

1:33:26.640 --> 1:33:34.080
 cases, it's a beam of... That's got to be the most epic thing the universe produces is quasars.

1:33:35.200 --> 1:33:40.560
 Well, it's a debate about what's the most epic, but quasars maybe or maybe gamma ray bursts or

1:33:40.560 --> 1:33:45.840
 something, but they are remarkable and they were a mystery for a long time. And they're

1:33:45.840 --> 1:33:50.160
 one of the things I worked on in my younger days. So even though they're so bright,

1:33:50.160 --> 1:33:54.960
 they're still a mystery and you can only see them. I think they're less of a mystery now.

1:33:54.960 --> 1:33:59.680
 I think we do understand basically what's going on. How were quasars discovered?

1:34:00.400 --> 1:34:05.760
 Well, they were discovered when astronomers found things that looked like stars and that they were

1:34:05.760 --> 1:34:12.880
 small enough to be a point like and not resolved by a telescope, but outshone an entire galaxy.

1:34:13.440 --> 1:34:15.840
 Yeah. That's suspicious.

1:34:15.840 --> 1:34:25.280
 Yes. But then they realized that what they were, they were objects which you now know are black

1:34:25.280 --> 1:34:33.840
 holes and black holes were capturing gas and that gas was getting very hot, but it was producing

1:34:33.840 --> 1:34:43.280
 far more energy than all the stars added together. And it was the energy of the black hole that was

1:34:43.920 --> 1:34:50.000
 lighting up all the gas in the galaxy. So you've got a spectrum of it there. So this was something

1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:56.160
 which was realized from the 1970s onwards. And as you say, the other thing we've learned is that

1:34:56.160 --> 1:35:03.840
 they often do produce these jets squirting out, which could be detected in all wave bands. So

1:35:03.840 --> 1:35:05.040
 there's now a standard picture.

1:35:05.040 --> 1:35:10.480
 So there's a giant black hole generating jets of light at the center of most galaxies.

1:35:10.480 --> 1:35:11.200
 Yes. That's right.

1:35:11.200 --> 1:35:18.480
 Do we know, do we have a sense if every galaxy has one of these big boys, big black holes?

1:35:18.480 --> 1:35:23.840
 Most galaxies have big black holes. They vary in size. The one in our galactic center.

1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:25.120
 Do we know much about ours?

1:35:25.120 --> 1:35:34.560
 We do. Yes. We know it weighs about as much as 4 million suns, which is less than some,

1:35:34.560 --> 1:35:40.560
 it's several billion other galaxies. But we know this one in our galactic center

1:35:40.560 --> 1:35:46.000
 isn't very bright or conspicuous. And that's because not much is falling into it at the

1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:52.560
 moment. If a black hole is isolated, then of course it doesn't radiate. All that radiates

1:35:52.560 --> 1:35:57.440
 is gas swirling into it, which is very hot or has magnetic fields.

1:35:57.440 --> 1:36:01.840
 It's only radiating the thing it's murdering or consuming, however you put it.

1:36:01.840 --> 1:36:07.440
 Yeah, that's right. And so it's thought that our galaxy may have been bright at some time

1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:16.320
 in the past, but now that's when the black hole formed or grew. But now it's not capturing

1:36:16.320 --> 1:36:24.320
 very much gas. And so it's rather faint and detected indirectly and by fairly weak radio

1:36:24.320 --> 1:36:31.520
 emission. And so I think the answer to your question is that we suspect that most galaxies

1:36:31.520 --> 1:36:36.960
 have a black hole in them. So that means at some stage in their lives, or maybe one or

1:36:36.960 --> 1:36:41.680
 more stages, they went through a phase of being like a quasar where that black hole

1:36:41.680 --> 1:36:47.680
 captured gas and became very, very bright. But for the rest of their lives, the black

1:36:47.680 --> 1:36:52.240
 holes are fairly quiescent because there's not much gas falling into them.

1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:58.640
 And so this universe of ours is sprinkled with a bunch of galaxies and giant black holes with

1:37:01.840 --> 1:37:08.400
 very large number of stars orbiting these black holes and then planets orbiting.

1:37:08.400 --> 1:37:17.680
 Likely, it seems like planets orbiting almost every one of those stars and just this beautiful

1:37:17.680 --> 1:37:23.280
 universe of ours. Well, what happens when galaxies collide, when these two big black holes

1:37:24.560 --> 1:37:32.800
 collide? Well, what would happen is that... Well, and I should say that this is going to happen

1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:37.840
 near us one day, but not for 4 billion years because the Andromeda galaxy, which is the

1:37:37.840 --> 1:37:44.640
 biggest galaxy near to us, which is about nearly 3 million light years away, which is a big disk

1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:53.120
 galaxy with a black hole in its hub, rather like our Milky Way. And that's falling towards us

1:37:53.120 --> 1:37:59.200
 because they're both in a common gravitational potential well. And that will collide with our

1:37:59.200 --> 1:38:05.440
 galaxy in about 4 billion years. But maybe it'll be less a collision and more of a dance because

1:38:05.440 --> 1:38:10.960
 it'll be like a swirling situation. But eventually, there'll be a merger. They'll

1:38:10.960 --> 1:38:16.080
 go through each other and then merge. In fact, there are nice movies to be made of this,

1:38:16.880 --> 1:38:26.000
 computer simulations, and it'll go through. And then there's a black hole in the center of

1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:34.640
 Andromeda and our galaxy. And the black holes will settle towards the center. Then they will

1:38:34.640 --> 1:38:39.840
 orbit around each other very fast, and then they will eventually merge. And that'll produce a big

1:38:39.840 --> 1:38:45.760
 burst of gravitational waves, a very big burst. That an alien civilization with a LIGO like

1:38:45.760 --> 1:38:50.240
 detector will be able to detect. Yes. Well, in fact, we can detect these

1:38:50.240 --> 1:38:57.440
 with their lower frequencies than the ways that will be detected by LIGO. So there's a

1:38:57.440 --> 1:39:04.480
 spatial interferometer which can detect these. It's about one cycle per hour rather than about

1:39:04.480 --> 1:39:11.680
 100 cycles per second. It's the ones that detect it. But that will happen. But thinking back to

1:39:11.680 --> 1:39:19.600
 what will happen in 4 billion years to any of our descendants, they'll be okay because the two disk

1:39:19.600 --> 1:39:26.320
 galaxies will merge. It'll end up as a sort of amorphous elliptical galaxy. But the stars won't

1:39:26.320 --> 1:39:32.800
 be much closer together than they are now. It'll still be just twice as many stars in a structure

1:39:32.800 --> 1:39:40.080
 almost as big. And so the chance of another star colliding with our sun would still be very small.

1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:45.120
 Because there's actually a lot of space between stars and planets.

1:39:45.120 --> 1:39:49.200
 Yes, the chance of a star getting close enough to affect our solar system's orbit

1:39:49.200 --> 1:39:53.440
 is small. And it won't change that very much. So you could be reassured.

1:39:53.440 --> 1:39:57.680
 A heck of a starry sky though. What would that look like?

1:39:57.680 --> 1:40:00.000
 Well, it won't make much difference even to that actually. It'll just be...

1:40:01.600 --> 1:40:05.600
 Wouldn't that look kind of beautiful when you're swirling? Oh, because it's swirling so slowly.

1:40:05.600 --> 1:40:10.320
 Yeah, but they're far away. So it'll be twice as many stars in the sky.

1:40:10.320 --> 1:40:12.880
 Yeah, but the pattern changes in interesting ways.

1:40:12.880 --> 1:40:17.200
 Yeah, the pattern will change a bit. And there won't be the Milky Way because the Milky Way

1:40:17.200 --> 1:40:22.400
 across the sky is because we are looking in the disk of our galaxy. And you lose that.

1:40:22.400 --> 1:40:28.800
 And because the disk will be so disrupted. And it'll be a more sort of spherical distribution.

1:40:28.800 --> 1:40:33.680
 And of course, many galaxies are like that. And that's probably because they have been through

1:40:33.680 --> 1:40:36.720
 mergers of this kind. If we survive four billion years,

1:40:36.720 --> 1:40:39.520
 we would likely be able to survive beyond that. Oh, yeah.

1:40:39.520 --> 1:40:45.440
 What's the other thing on the horizon for humans in terms of the sun burning out,

1:40:45.440 --> 1:40:51.360
 all those kinds of interesting cosmological threats to our civilization?

1:40:51.360 --> 1:40:57.920
 Well, I think on the cosmological time scale, because it won't be humans, because even if

1:40:57.920 --> 1:41:03.120
 evolution is no faster than Darwinian, and I would argue it will be faster than Darwinian

1:41:03.120 --> 1:41:09.760
 in the future, then we're thinking about six billion years before the sun dies. So any

1:41:09.760 --> 1:41:14.320
 entities watching the death of the sun, if they're still around, they'll be as different

1:41:14.320 --> 1:41:20.640
 from much as we are from slime mold or something. And far more different still if they become

1:41:20.640 --> 1:41:25.600
 electronic. So on that time scale, we just can't predict anything. But I think going back to

1:41:25.600 --> 1:41:32.880
 the human time scale, then we've talked about whether there'll be people on Mars by the end

1:41:32.880 --> 1:41:39.760
 of a century. And even in these long perspectives, then indeed, this century is very special,

1:41:39.760 --> 1:41:45.760
 because it may see the transition between purely flesh and blood entities to those which are sort

1:41:45.760 --> 1:41:51.040
 of cyborgs. And that'll be an important transition in the future.

1:41:51.040 --> 1:41:55.760
 But of course, the other importance, and this has been the theme of a couple of my older books,

1:41:55.760 --> 1:42:02.400
 is that this is the first century when one species, namely our species, has the future of

1:42:02.400 --> 1:42:10.800
 the planet in its hands. And that's because of two types of concerns. One is that there are more

1:42:10.800 --> 1:42:16.720
 of us where more of us are living in the past, and the other is that there are more of us who are

1:42:16.720 --> 1:42:23.840
 living in the future. So those are two concerns. One is that there are more of us where more

1:42:23.840 --> 1:42:30.640
 demanding of energy and resources, and therefore we are for the first time changing the whole

1:42:30.640 --> 1:42:37.360
 planet through climate change, loss of biodiversity, and all those issues. This has never

1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:43.760
 happened in the past, because there haven't been enough humans. So this is an effect that's

1:42:43.760 --> 1:42:51.040
 now, and rightly so, because we've got to ensure that we leave a heritage that isn't eroded or

1:42:51.040 --> 1:42:55.760
 damaged to future generations. And so that's one class of threats.

1:42:55.760 --> 1:43:02.800
 But there's another thing that worries me, perhaps more than many people seem to worry,

1:43:02.800 --> 1:43:11.520
 and that's the threat of misuse of technology. And so this is particularly because technologies

1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:21.920
 empower even small groups of malevolent people, or indeed even careless people, to create some

1:43:21.920 --> 1:43:30.400
 effect which could cascade globally. And to take an example, a dangerous pathogen or pandemic,

1:43:30.400 --> 1:43:42.160
 I mean, my worst nightmare is that there could be some small group that can engineer a virus

1:43:42.160 --> 1:43:47.600
 to make it more variant or more transmissible than a natural virus. This is a gain of function

1:43:47.600 --> 1:43:51.840
 experiments which were done on the flu virus 10 years ago and can be done for others.

1:43:51.840 --> 1:44:02.720
 And of course, we now know from COVID 19 that our world is so interconnected that a disaster in one

1:44:02.720 --> 1:44:07.680
 part of the world can't be confined to that part and will spread globally. So it's possible for

1:44:08.240 --> 1:44:14.320
 a few dissidents with expertise in biotech could create a global catastrophe of that kind.

1:44:14.320 --> 1:44:21.600
 And also, I think we need to worry about very large scale disruption by cyber attacks and

1:44:21.600 --> 1:44:31.680
 in fact, I quote in one of my books, a 2012 report from the American Pentagon about the possibility

1:44:31.680 --> 1:44:38.720
 of a state level cyber attack on the electricity grid in Eastern United States, which is it could

1:44:38.720 --> 1:44:45.680
 happen. And it says at the end of this chapter that this would merit a nuclear response. This

1:44:45.680 --> 1:44:51.600
 is a pretty scary possibility. And that was 10 years ago. And I think now what would have needed

1:44:51.600 --> 1:44:57.520
 a state actor then could be done perhaps by a small group empowered by AI. And so there's

1:44:57.520 --> 1:45:06.080
 obviously been an arms race between the cyber criminals and the cyber security people. Not

1:45:06.080 --> 1:45:11.600
 clear which side is winning. But the main point is that as we become more dependent on more

1:45:11.600 --> 1:45:21.680
 integrated systems, then we get more vulnerable. And so we have the knowledge, then the misuse of

1:45:21.680 --> 1:45:28.960
 that knowledge becomes more and more of a threat. And I'd say bio and cyber are the two biggest

1:45:28.960 --> 1:45:37.680
 concerns. And if we depend too much on AI and complex systems, then just breakdowns, it may be

1:45:37.680 --> 1:45:43.600
 that they break down. And even if it's an innocent breakdown, then it may be pretty hard to mend it.

1:45:43.600 --> 1:45:48.720
 And just think how much worse the pandemic would have been if we'd lost the internet in the middle

1:45:48.720 --> 1:45:55.440
 of it. We'd be dependent more than ever for communication and everything else on the internet

1:45:55.440 --> 1:46:01.360
 and Zooms and all that. And if that had broken down, that would have made things far worse. And

1:46:01.360 --> 1:46:07.520
 those are the kinds of threats that we, I think, need to be more energized and politicians need to

1:46:07.520 --> 1:46:13.680
 be more energized to minimize. And one of the things I've been doing in the last year through

1:46:13.680 --> 1:46:20.720
 being a member of our part of our parliament is I have to instigate a committee to think more on

1:46:20.720 --> 1:46:26.400
 better preparedness for extreme technological risks and things like that. So they're a big

1:46:26.400 --> 1:46:36.800
 concern in my mind that we've got to make sure that we can benefit from these advances but safely

1:46:36.800 --> 1:46:42.720
 because the stakes are getting higher and the benefits are getting great, as we know, huge

1:46:42.720 --> 1:46:50.400
 benefits from computers, but also huge downsides as well. And one of the things this war in Ukraine

1:46:50.400 --> 1:46:58.080
 has shown, one of the most terrifying things outside of the humanitarian crisis, is that at

1:46:58.080 --> 1:47:10.400
 least for me, I realized that the human capacity to initiate nuclear war is greater than I thought.

1:47:11.120 --> 1:47:17.120
 I thought the lessons of the past have been learned. It seems that we hang on the brink of

1:47:17.120 --> 1:47:28.560
 nuclear war with this conflict like every single day with just one mistake or bad actor or the

1:47:28.560 --> 1:47:35.760
 actual leaders of the particular nations launching a nuclear strike and all hell breaks loose. So

1:47:35.760 --> 1:47:43.200
 then add into that picture, cyber attacks and so on, that can lead to confusion and chaos. And then

1:47:43.200 --> 1:47:56.000
 out of that confusion, calculations are made such that a nuclear weapon is launched and then

1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:05.520
 you're talking about, I mean, it directs probably 60, 70% of humans on Earth are dead instantly.

1:48:05.520 --> 1:48:14.320
 And then the rest, I mean, it's basically 99% of the human population is wiped out in the period

1:48:14.320 --> 1:48:18.640
 of five years. Well, it may not be that bad, but it will be a devastation for civilization,

1:48:18.640 --> 1:48:24.000
 of course. And of course, you were quite right that this could happen very quickly because of

1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:34.560
 information coming in and there's hardly enough time for human collected and careful thought.

1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:41.520
 And there have been recorded cases of false alarms. There's several where there have been

1:48:41.520 --> 1:48:48.080
 suspected attacks from the other side. And fortunately, they've been really false alarm

1:48:48.080 --> 1:48:53.440
 soon enough, but this could happen. And there's a new class of threats actually, which in our

1:48:53.440 --> 1:49:00.400
 center in Cambridge, people are thinking about, which is that the commander control system

1:49:00.400 --> 1:49:08.880
 of the nuclear weapons and the submarine fleet and all that is now more automated and could be

1:49:08.880 --> 1:49:16.320
 subject to cyber attacks. And that's a new threat which didn't exist 30 years ago. And so I think

1:49:16.800 --> 1:49:26.800
 indeed, we're in a sort of scary world, I think. And it's because things happen faster and human

1:49:26.800 --> 1:49:32.960
 beings aren't in such direct and immediate control because so much is delegated to machines. And

1:49:32.960 --> 1:49:40.720
 also because the world is so much more interconnected, then some local event can cascade

1:49:40.720 --> 1:49:44.800
 globally in a way it never could in the past and much faster.

1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:54.000
 Yeah, it's a double edged sword because the interconnectedness brings a higher quality of

1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:56.800
 life across a lot of metrics.

1:49:56.800 --> 1:50:02.000
 Yeah, it can do. But of course, there again, I mean, if you think of supply chains where we

1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:06.960
 get stuff from around the world, then one lesson we've learned is that there's a trade off between

1:50:06.960 --> 1:50:16.240
 resilience and efficiency and it's resilient to have an inventory in stock and to depend on local

1:50:16.240 --> 1:50:24.160
 supplies, whereas they're more efficient to have long supply chains. But the risk there is that a

1:50:24.160 --> 1:50:30.080
 break in one link in one chain can screw up car production. This has already happened in the

1:50:30.080 --> 1:50:35.120
 pandemic. So there's a trade off. And there are other examples. I mean, for instance, the other

1:50:35.120 --> 1:50:42.000
 thing we learned was that it may be efficient to have 95% of your hospital intensive care beds

1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:47.120
 occupied all the time, which has been the UK situation, whereas to do what the Germans do and

1:50:47.120 --> 1:50:53.200
 always keep 20% of them free for an emergency is really a sensible precaution. And so I think

1:50:53.200 --> 1:51:01.200
 we've probably learned a lot of lessons from COVID 19. And they would include rebalancing the

1:51:01.200 --> 1:51:04.800
 trade off between resilience and efficiency.

1:51:04.800 --> 1:51:12.000
 Boy, the fact that COVID 19, a pandemic that could have been a lot, a lot worse,

1:51:12.800 --> 1:51:14.560
 brought the world to its knees anyway.

1:51:15.360 --> 1:51:20.800
 It could be far worse in terms of its fatality rate or something like that, of course.

1:51:20.800 --> 1:51:26.000
 So the fact that that, I mean, it revealed so many flaws in our human institutions.

1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:38.800
 And I think I'm rather pessimistic because I do worry about the baractol, a small group

1:51:38.800 --> 1:51:46.720
 who can produce catastrophe. And if you imagine someone with access to the kind of equipment that's

1:51:46.720 --> 1:51:52.880
 available in university labs or industrial labs, and they could create some dangerous pathogen,

1:51:52.880 --> 1:52:00.880
 then even one such person is too many. And how can we stop that? Because it's true that you can

1:52:00.880 --> 1:52:07.040
 have regulations. I mean, academies are having meetings, et cetera, about how to regulate these

1:52:07.040 --> 1:52:12.560
 new biological experiments, et cetera, make them safe. But even if you have all these regulations,

1:52:13.280 --> 1:52:20.560
 then enforcing regulations is pretty hopeless. We can't enforce the tax laws globally. We can't

1:52:20.560 --> 1:52:28.720
 enforce the drug laws globally. And so similarly, we can't readily enforce the laws against people

1:52:28.720 --> 1:52:33.680
 doing these dangerous experiments, even if all the governments say they should be prohibited.

1:52:33.680 --> 1:52:40.480
 And so my line on this is that all nations are going to face a big trade off between

1:52:40.480 --> 1:52:50.720
 three things we value, freedom, security, and privacy. And I think different nations will

1:52:52.080 --> 1:52:59.920
 make that choice differently. The Chinese would give up privacy and have certainly more security,

1:52:59.920 --> 1:53:08.800
 if not more liberty. But I think in our countries, I think we're going to have to give up more

1:53:08.800 --> 1:53:15.840
 privacy in the same way. That's a really interesting trade off. But there's also something

1:53:15.840 --> 1:53:21.600
 about human nature here, where I personally believe that all humans are capable of good and

1:53:21.600 --> 1:53:32.160
 evil. And there's some aspect to which we can fight this by encouraging people, incentivizing people

1:53:32.160 --> 1:53:38.960
 towards the better angels of their nature. So in order for a small group of people to create,

1:53:38.960 --> 1:53:47.600
 to engineer deadly pathogens, you have to have people that, for whatever trajectory took them

1:53:47.600 --> 1:53:55.840
 in life, wanting to do that kind of thing. And if we can aggressively work on a world

1:53:55.840 --> 1:54:03.360
 that sort of sees the beauty in everybody and encourages the flourishing of everybody in terms

1:54:03.360 --> 1:54:07.440
 of mental health, in terms of meaning, in terms of all those kinds of things, that's one way

1:54:08.320 --> 1:54:14.320
 to fight the development of weapons that can lead to atrocities.

1:54:14.320 --> 1:54:19.360
 RL Yes, and I completely agree with that and to reduce the reason why people feel embittered.

1:54:19.360 --> 1:54:26.000
 But of course, we've got a long way to go to do that. Because if you look at the present world,

1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:34.720
 nearly everyone in Africa has reason to feel embittered because their economic development

1:54:34.720 --> 1:54:39.760
 is lagging behind most of the rest of the world. And the prospects of getting out of

1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:46.000
 the poverty trap is rather bleak, especially as the population grows. Because for instance,

1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:50.160
 they can't develop like the Eastern Tigers by cheap manufacturing, because robots have taken

1:54:50.160 --> 1:54:59.120
 that over. So they naturally feel embittered by the inequality. And of course, what we need to have

1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:05.600
 is some sort of mega version of the Marshall Plan that helped Europe in the post World War II era

1:55:06.400 --> 1:55:11.840
 to enable Africa to develop. That would be not just an altruistic thing for Europe to do,

1:55:11.840 --> 1:55:19.520
 but in our interest because otherwise, those in Africa will feel massively disaffected.

1:55:20.240 --> 1:55:24.960
 And indeed, it's a manifestation of the excessive inequalities, the fact that the

1:55:24.960 --> 1:55:29.920
 2000 richest people in the world have enough money to double the income of the bottom billion.

1:55:30.640 --> 1:55:39.040
 And that's an indictment of the ethics of the world. And this is where my friend Stephen Pinker

1:55:39.040 --> 1:55:46.400
 and I have had some contact. We wrote joint articles on bio threats and all that. But he

1:55:46.400 --> 1:55:54.560
 writes these books, being very optimistic about quoting figures about how life expectancy has gone

1:55:54.560 --> 1:55:58.480
 up, infant mortality has gone down, literacy has gone up, and all those things. And he's quite

1:55:58.480 --> 1:56:04.320
 right about that. And so he says the world's getting better. Do you disagree with your

1:56:04.320 --> 1:56:11.680
 friends, Stephen Pinker? Well, I mean, I agree with those facts. But I think he misses out part

1:56:11.680 --> 1:56:19.120
 of the picture. Because there's a new class of threats, which hang over us now, which didn't

1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:24.880
 hang over us in the past. And I would also question whether we have collectively improved

1:56:24.880 --> 1:56:30.640
 our ethics at all. Because let's think back to the Middle Ages. It's true that, as Pinker says,

1:56:30.640 --> 1:56:37.680
 the average person was in a more miserable state than they are today, on average. For all the

1:56:37.680 --> 1:56:44.720
 reasons he quantifies, that's fine. But in the Middle Ages, there wasn't very much that could

1:56:44.720 --> 1:56:51.120
 have been done to improve people's lot in life because of lack of knowledge and lack of science,

1:56:51.120 --> 1:56:57.200
 etc. So the gap between the way the world was, which was pretty miserable, and the way the world

1:56:57.200 --> 1:57:03.520
 could have been, which wasn't all that much better, was fairly narrow. Whereas now, the gap

1:57:03.520 --> 1:57:09.520
 between the way the world is and the way the world could be is far, far wider. And therefore, I think

1:57:09.520 --> 1:57:18.720
 we are ethically more at fault in allowing this gap to get wider than it was in medieval times.

1:57:18.720 --> 1:57:26.160
 And so I would very much question and dispute the idea that we are ethically in advance of

1:57:26.160 --> 1:57:33.200
 our predecessors collectively. That's a lot of interesting hypotheses in there. It's a fascinating

1:57:33.200 --> 1:57:39.040
 question of how much is the size of that gap between the way the world is and the way the world

1:57:39.040 --> 1:57:44.640
 could be is a reflection of our ethics. Or maybe sometimes it's just a reflection of a very large

1:57:44.640 --> 1:57:51.280
 number of people. Maybe it's a technical challenge too. It's not just... Well, of our political

1:57:51.280 --> 1:57:58.960
 systems. And we're trying to figure this thing out. There's 20th century, tried this thing that

1:57:58.960 --> 1:58:05.040
 sounded really good on paper of collective, the communism type of things. And it's like,

1:58:05.600 --> 1:58:10.720
 turned out at least the way that was done there, that leads to atrocities and the suffering and

1:58:10.720 --> 1:58:15.840
 the murder of tens of millions of people. Okay, so that didn't work. Let's try democracy.

1:58:16.400 --> 1:58:20.880
 And that seems to have a lot of flaws, but it seems to be the best thing we got so far.

1:58:20.880 --> 1:58:25.360
 So we're trying to figure this out as our technologies become more and more powerful,

1:58:25.360 --> 1:58:30.160
 have the capacity to do a lot of good to the world, but also unfortunately have the capacity

1:58:30.160 --> 1:58:35.200
 to destroy the entirety of the human civilization. And I think it's social media generally,

1:58:35.840 --> 1:58:43.840
 which makes it harder to get a sort of moderate consensus because in the old days when people got

1:58:43.840 --> 1:58:49.680
 their news filtered through responsible journalists in this country, the BBC and the

1:58:49.680 --> 1:58:55.520
 main newspapers, et cetera, they would muffle the crazy extremes. Whereas now, of course,

1:58:56.480 --> 1:59:00.800
 they're on the internet. And if you click on them, you get something still more extreme.

1:59:00.800 --> 1:59:06.240
 And so I think we are seeing a sort of dangerous polarization, which I think is going to make all

1:59:06.240 --> 1:59:09.920
 countries harder to govern. And that's something which I'm pessimistic about.

1:59:09.920 --> 1:59:15.360
 RL So to push back, it is true that brilliant people like you highlighting the limitations

1:59:15.360 --> 1:59:22.480
 of social media is making them realize the stakes and the failings of social media companies,

1:59:22.480 --> 1:59:26.560
 but at the same time, they're revealing the division. It's not like they're creating it,

1:59:26.560 --> 1:59:34.160
 they're revealing it in part. And so that puts a lot of, that puts the responsibility

1:59:34.160 --> 1:59:38.480
 into the hands of social media and the opportunity in the hands of social media

1:59:38.480 --> 1:59:45.120
 to alleviate some of that division. So it could in the long arc of human history result. So bringing

1:59:45.120 --> 1:59:52.000
 some of those divisions and the anger and the hatred to the surface so that we can talk about

1:59:52.000 --> 1:59:57.680
 it. And as opposed to disproportionately promoting it, actually just surfacing it so we can get over

1:59:57.680 --> 2:00:02.560
 it. Well, you're assuming that the fat cats are more public spirited than the politicians.

2:00:02.560 --> 2:00:03.680
 And I'm not sure about that.

2:00:03.680 --> 2:00:10.800
 RL I think there's a lot of money to be made in being publicly spirited. I think there's a lot of

2:00:10.800 --> 2:00:16.400
 money to be made in increasing the amount of love in the world, despite the sort of public perception

2:00:17.040 --> 2:00:22.480
 that all the social media companies heads are interested in doing is making money.

2:00:23.680 --> 2:00:30.240
 I think that may be true, but I just personally believe people being happy

2:00:31.840 --> 2:00:39.040
 is a hell of a good business model. And so making as many people happy, helping them flourish in a

2:00:39.040 --> 2:00:42.240
 long term way, that's a good way to make money.

2:00:42.240 --> 2:00:47.120
 RL Well, I think on the other hand, guilt and shame are good motives to make you behave better

2:00:47.120 --> 2:00:49.760
 in the future. That's my experience.

2:00:49.760 --> 2:00:56.480
 RL From maybe in the political perspective, certainly it's the case. But it does make sense

2:00:56.480 --> 2:01:02.480
 now that we can destroy ourselves with nuclear weapons, with engineered pandemics and so on,

2:01:02.480 --> 2:01:14.560
 that the aliens would show up. If I had a leadership position, maybe as a scientist

2:01:14.560 --> 2:01:22.320
 or otherwise in an alien civilization, and I would come upon Earth, I would try to watch from

2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:31.680
 a distance, do not interfere. And I would start interfering when these life forms start

2:01:31.680 --> 2:01:38.720
 becoming quite, have the capacity to be destructive. And so, I mean, it is an interesting

2:01:38.720 --> 2:01:43.920
 question when people talk about UFO sightings and all those kinds of things that at least...

2:01:43.920 --> 2:01:45.920
 RL These are benign aliens you're thinking of.

2:01:45.920 --> 2:01:55.920
 RL Benign, yes. I mean, they benign, almost curious, almost, partially, as with all curiosity,

2:01:55.920 --> 2:02:00.720
 partially selfish to try to observe, is there something interesting about this particular

2:02:00.720 --> 2:02:06.560
 evolutionary system? Because I'm sure even to aliens, Earth is a curiosity.

2:02:06.560 --> 2:02:09.760
 RL Yeah. Well, it's in its very special stage.

2:02:09.760 --> 2:02:12.560
 RL It's very special. Perhaps it's very short.

2:02:12.560 --> 2:02:17.200
 RL This century is very special among the 45 million centuries the Earth experienced already.

2:02:17.200 --> 2:02:22.960
 So it is a very special time where they should be specially interested. But I think going back

2:02:22.960 --> 2:02:31.600
 to the politics, the other problem is getting people who have short term concerns to care

2:02:31.600 --> 2:02:38.320
 about the long term. By the long term, I now mean just looking 30 years or so ahead. I

2:02:38.320 --> 2:02:43.680
 know people who've been scientific advisors to governments and things, and they may make

2:02:43.680 --> 2:02:48.080
 these points, but of course, they don't have much traction because as we know very well,

2:02:48.080 --> 2:02:54.080
 any politician has an urgent agenda of very worrying things to deal with. And so they

2:02:54.080 --> 2:03:01.280
 aren't going to prioritize these issues, which are longer term and less immediate, and don't

2:03:01.280 --> 2:03:07.040
 just concern their constituents, they concern distant parts of the world. And so I think

2:03:08.080 --> 2:03:17.200
 what we have to do is to enlist charismatic individuals to convert the public, because

2:03:17.200 --> 2:03:25.120
 if the politicians know the public care about something, climate change as an example, then

2:03:25.840 --> 2:03:34.400
 they will make decisions which take cognizance of that. And I think for that to happen, then

2:03:34.400 --> 2:03:42.000
 we do need some public individuals who are respected by everyone, and to have a high

2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:48.800
 profile. And in the climate context, I would say that I've mentioned four very disparate

2:03:48.800 --> 2:03:54.080
 people who've had such a big effect in the last few years. One is Pope Francis, the other is

2:03:54.080 --> 2:03:58.800
 David Attenborough, the other is Bill Gates, and the other is Greta Thornberg. And those

2:03:58.800 --> 2:04:07.040
 four people have certainly had a big shift in public opinion, and even changed the rhetoric

2:04:07.040 --> 2:04:14.960
 of business, although how deep that is, I don't know. But politicians can't let these

2:04:14.960 --> 2:04:21.600
 issues drop down off the agenda if there's a public clamor, and it needs people like that

2:04:21.600 --> 2:04:23.040
 to keep the public clamor going.

2:04:23.040 --> 2:04:27.440
 To push back a little bit, so those four are very interesting, and I have deep respect

2:04:27.440 --> 2:04:33.520
 for them. They have, except David Attenborough, David Attenborough is really, I mean, everybody

2:04:33.520 --> 2:04:40.480
 loves him. I can't say anything. But Bill Gates and Greta, that also has created a lot

2:04:40.480 --> 2:04:46.800
 of division. And this is a big problem, so it's not just charismatic. I put that responsibility

2:04:46.800 --> 2:04:57.280
 actually on the scientific community and the politicians. So we need the charismatic leaders,

2:04:58.080 --> 2:05:03.200
 and they're rare. When you look at human history, those are the ones that make a difference.

2:05:03.200 --> 2:05:13.520
 Those are the ones that, not deride, they inspire the populace to think long term. The

2:05:13.520 --> 2:05:19.520
 JFK will go to the moon in this decade, not because it's easy, but because it is hard.

2:05:20.320 --> 2:05:30.320
 There's no discussion about short term political gains or any of that kind of stuff in the

2:05:30.320 --> 2:05:37.200
 vision of going to the moon, or going to Mars, or taking on gigantic projects, or taking

2:05:37.200 --> 2:05:42.400
 on world hunger, or taking on climate change, or the education system, all those things

2:05:42.400 --> 2:05:47.360
 that require long term significant investment. That requires...

2:05:47.360 --> 2:05:53.440
 But it's hard to find those people. And incidentally, I think another problem, which is a downside

2:05:53.440 --> 2:06:01.120
 of social media, is that of younger people I know, the number who would contemplate a

2:06:01.120 --> 2:06:07.440
 political career has gone down because of the pressures on them and their family from

2:06:07.440 --> 2:06:14.560
 social media. It's a hell of a job now. And so I think we are all losers because the quality

2:06:14.560 --> 2:06:24.240
 of people who choose that path is really dropping. And as we see by the quality of those who

2:06:24.240 --> 2:06:25.360
 are in these compositions.

2:06:25.360 --> 2:06:31.840
 That said, I think the silver lining there is the quality of the competition actually

2:06:31.840 --> 2:06:39.200
 is inspiring because it shows to you that there's a dire need of leaders, which I think

2:06:39.200 --> 2:06:43.600
 would be inspiring to young people to step into the fold. I mean, great leaders are not

2:06:43.600 --> 2:06:51.200
 afraid of a little bit of fire on social media. So if you have a 20 year old kid now, 25 year

2:06:51.200 --> 2:06:57.680
 old kid is seeing how the world has responded to the pandemic, seeing the geopolitical division

2:06:57.680 --> 2:07:03.520
 over the war in Ukraine, seeing the brewing war between the West and China. We need great

2:07:03.520 --> 2:07:11.520
 leaders and there's a hunger for them and the time will come when they step up. I believe

2:07:11.520 --> 2:07:16.480
 that. But also to add to your list of four, he doesn't get enough credit. I've been defending

2:07:16.480 --> 2:07:22.880
 him in this conversation, Elon Musk, in terms of the fight in climate change. But he also

2:07:22.880 --> 2:07:27.120
 has led to a lot of division, but we need more David Edinburgh.

2:07:27.120 --> 2:07:33.040
 Yeah, no, no. I mean, I'm a fan. Definitely. I mean, I've heard him described as a 21st

2:07:33.040 --> 2:07:40.320
 century Brunel for his innovation and that's true. But whether he's an ethical inspiration,

2:07:40.320 --> 2:07:41.680
 I don't know.

2:07:41.680 --> 2:07:48.960
 Yeah, he has a lot of fun on Twitter. Well, let me ask you to put on your wise sage hat.

2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:56.240
 What advice would you give to young people today? Maybe they're teenagers in high school,

2:07:56.240 --> 2:08:04.560
 maybe early college. What advice would you give to a career or have a life they can be

2:08:04.560 --> 2:08:05.360
 proud of?

2:08:05.360 --> 2:08:14.480
 Yes. Well, I'd be very diffident, really, about offering any wisdom. But I think they

2:08:14.480 --> 2:08:26.720
 should realise that the choices they make at that time are important. And from the experience

2:08:27.440 --> 2:08:33.200
 I've had with many friends, many people don't realise that opportunities open until it's

2:08:33.200 --> 2:08:38.560
 too late. They somehow think that some opportunities are only open to a few privileged people and

2:08:38.560 --> 2:08:48.720
 they don't even try and that they could succeed. But if I focus on people working in some profession

2:08:48.720 --> 2:08:56.000
 I know about, like science, I would say pick an area to work in where new things are happening,

2:08:56.000 --> 2:09:02.640
 where you can do something that the old guys never had a chance to think about. Don't go

2:09:02.640 --> 2:09:07.680
 into a field that's fairly stagnant because then there's nothing much to do or you'll

2:09:07.680 --> 2:09:12.160
 be trying to tackle the problems that the old guys got stuck on. And so I think in science,

2:09:13.120 --> 2:09:19.200
 I can give people good advice that they should pick a subject where there are exciting new

2:09:19.200 --> 2:09:24.560
 developments. And also, of course, something which suits their style because even within

2:09:24.560 --> 2:09:29.520
 science, which is just one profession, there's a big range of style between the sort of solitary

2:09:29.520 --> 2:09:34.080
 thinker, the person who does field work, the person who works in a big team, et cetera,

2:09:34.080 --> 2:09:40.560
 and whether you like computing or mathematical thought, et cetera. So pick some subject that

2:09:40.560 --> 2:09:46.960
 suits your style and where things are happening fast. And be prepared to be flexible. That's what

2:09:46.960 --> 2:09:51.600
 I'd say, really. Keep your eyes open for the opportunity throughout, like you said. Go to

2:09:51.600 --> 2:09:56.240
 a new field. Go to a field where new cool stuff is happening. Just keep your eyes open.

2:09:56.240 --> 2:10:01.840
 Yes, that's patitudinous. But I think most of us, and I include myself in this, didn't realize

2:10:01.840 --> 2:10:03.200
 this sort of thing isn't too late.

2:10:05.840 --> 2:10:13.440
 Yeah, I think this applies way beyond science. What do you make of this finiteness of our life?

2:10:13.920 --> 2:10:18.560
 Do you think about death? Do you think about mortality? Do you think about your mortality?

2:10:18.560 --> 2:10:20.320
 And are you afraid of death?

2:10:20.320 --> 2:10:25.600
 Well, I mean, I'm not afraid because I think I'm lucky. I feel lucky to have lasted as long as I

2:10:25.600 --> 2:10:35.040
 have and to have been fairly lucky in my life in many respects compared to most people. So I feel

2:10:35.040 --> 2:10:44.960
 very fortunate. This reminds me of this current emphasis on living much longer, the so called

2:10:44.960 --> 2:10:53.680
 Altos Laboratories, which have been set up by billionaires. There's one in San Francisco,

2:10:53.680 --> 2:11:03.280
 one in La Jolla, I think, and one in Cambridge. And they're funded by these guys who when young

2:11:03.280 --> 2:11:07.840
 wanted to be rich, and now they're rich, they want to be young again. They won't find that quite so

2:11:07.840 --> 2:11:14.560
 easy. And do we want this? I don't know. If there was some elite that was able to live much longer

2:11:14.560 --> 2:11:23.040
 than others, that would be a really fundamental kind of inequality. And I think if it happened

2:11:23.040 --> 2:11:32.800
 to everyone, then that might be an improvement. It's not so obvious. But I think for my part,

2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:39.280
 I think to have lived as long as most people and had a fortunate life is all I can

2:11:39.280 --> 2:11:44.720
 expect and a lot to be grateful for. Those are all past issues.

2:11:44.720 --> 2:11:50.800
 Well, I am incredibly honored that you sit down with me today. I thank you so much for life,

2:11:51.680 --> 2:11:57.360
 of exploring some of the deepest mysteries of our universe and of our humanity and thinking

2:11:57.360 --> 2:12:02.960
 about our future with existential risks that are before us. It's a huge honor,

2:12:02.960 --> 2:12:06.240
 Martin, that you sit with me and I really enjoyed it.

2:12:06.240 --> 2:12:09.440
 Well, thank you, Lex. I thought we couldn't go on for as long as this,

2:12:09.440 --> 2:12:11.600
 but we could have gone on much longer.

2:12:11.600 --> 2:12:16.480
 Exactly. Thank you so much. Thank you for listening to this conversation with Martin

2:12:16.480 --> 2:12:21.520
 Rees. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now,

2:12:21.520 --> 2:12:23.920
 let me leave you with some words from Martin Rees himself.

2:12:24.720 --> 2:12:30.640
 I'd like to widen people's awareness of the tremendous time spent lying ahead for our planet

2:12:30.640 --> 2:12:37.440
 and for life itself. Most educated people are aware that we're the outcome of nearly 4 billion

2:12:37.440 --> 2:12:44.000
 years of Darwinian selection, but many tend to think that humans are somehow the culmination.

2:12:44.880 --> 2:12:51.360
 Our sun, however, is less than halfway through its lifespan. It will not be humans who watch

2:12:51.360 --> 2:12:58.400
 the sun's demise 6 billion years from now. Any creatures that then exist will be as different

2:12:58.400 --> 2:13:16.080
 from us as we are from bacteria or amoeba. Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
