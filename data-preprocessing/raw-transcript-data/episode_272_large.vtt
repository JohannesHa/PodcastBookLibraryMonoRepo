WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.480
 I was on the run for four months, stole $600,000.

00:03.480 --> 00:05.120
 I was in Las Vegas, Nevada.

00:05.120 --> 00:07.320
 One day I had stolen the night before

00:07.320 --> 00:09.500
 and stolen 160K out of ATMs.

00:10.440 --> 00:12.760
 Went in the next morning, I woke up,

00:12.760 --> 00:14.680
 signed on to cartersmarket.com,

00:14.680 --> 00:16.940
 which was ran by Max Butler, the Iceman.

00:17.880 --> 00:21.160
 And there's my name, US Most Wanted on it.

00:21.160 --> 00:24.120
 And that gets your attention.

00:24.120 --> 00:26.480
 That was my real name with US Most Wanted beside of it.

00:26.480 --> 00:29.160
 Nobody knew my real name in that environment at all,

00:29.160 --> 00:30.280
 but then they did.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.080
 And it was talking about me being part

00:32.080 --> 00:34.880
 of the Secret Service, Operation Anglerfish,

00:34.880 --> 00:36.480
 everything else.

00:36.480 --> 00:37.920
 So of course, they're all like.

00:37.920 --> 00:39.040
 Everybody's after you.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.960
 They're like, oh yeah, we're gonna get this son of a bitch.

00:43.720 --> 00:46.200
 The following is a conversation with Brett Johnson,

00:46.200 --> 00:48.680
 a former cyber criminal who built the first

00:48.680 --> 00:52.000
 organized cybercrime community called Shadow Crew

00:52.000 --> 00:54.480
 that is the precursor to today's Darknet

00:54.480 --> 00:56.200
 and Darknet markets.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.960
 He's referred to by the United States Secret Service

00:58.960 --> 01:02.080
 as quote, the original internet godfather.

01:02.080 --> 01:05.120
 He has been the central figure in the cybercrime world

01:05.120 --> 01:06.640
 for almost 20 years.

01:06.640 --> 01:10.280
 Placed on the US Most Wanted list in 2006

01:10.280 --> 01:14.080
 before being convicted of 39 felonies for cybercrime,

01:14.080 --> 01:17.680
 escaped from prison, and then eventually being locked up,

01:17.680 --> 01:21.720
 served his time, and now is helping people understand

01:21.720 --> 01:24.320
 and fight cybercrime.

01:24.320 --> 01:29.320
 This was a raw, honest, emotional, and real episode.

01:29.440 --> 01:32.880
 Brett has caused a lot of pain to a lot of people,

01:32.880 --> 01:36.960
 and yet his own story is full of trauma and pain,

01:36.960 --> 01:39.520
 and also redemption and love.

01:40.480 --> 01:44.240
 This is a good time to say that I have and I will

01:44.240 --> 01:46.760
 talk to people who have served time in prison,

01:46.760 --> 01:50.480
 and perhaps people who currently are in prison.

01:50.480 --> 01:53.080
 I will try to do my best to both empathize

01:53.080 --> 01:56.240
 with the person across from me and not let them sugarcoat,

01:56.240 --> 02:00.440
 explain away, or dismiss the crimes they committed.

02:00.440 --> 02:01.920
 This is a tough line to walk,

02:01.920 --> 02:04.640
 because if you close your heart to the other person,

02:04.640 --> 02:08.000
 you'll never fully understand their mind and their story.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.720
 But if you open the heart too much,

02:10.720 --> 02:13.240
 you can be manipulated to where the conversation

02:13.240 --> 02:16.540
 reveals nothing honest or real.

02:17.600 --> 02:21.520
 This requires skill and willingness to take the risk.

02:21.520 --> 02:23.400
 I don't know about the skill part,

02:23.400 --> 02:25.120
 but I'd like to take the risk.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.160
 I always wear my heart on my sleeve.

02:27.160 --> 02:29.800
 If I get hurt for it, that's life.

02:30.860 --> 02:32.600
 As I've said, I want to understand

02:32.600 --> 02:34.620
 what makes a person do these crimes,

02:34.620 --> 02:37.640
 the particular characteristics of their temporary

02:37.640 --> 02:41.560
 or permanent madness, their justifications,

02:41.560 --> 02:43.520
 but also their humanity.

02:43.520 --> 02:45.520
 I believe each of us have the capacity

02:45.520 --> 02:48.320
 to become both the criminal and the victim,

02:48.320 --> 02:50.760
 the predator and the prey.

02:50.760 --> 02:53.200
 It's up to us to avoid these paths

02:53.200 --> 02:55.520
 or to find the path to redemption.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.320
 It's on each of us.

02:57.320 --> 03:00.360
 It's our responsibility and burden

03:00.360 --> 03:04.200
 of being human in a complicated and dangerous world.

03:05.440 --> 03:07.160
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

03:09.200 --> 03:10.320
 in the description.

03:10.320 --> 03:14.200
 And now, dear friends, here's Brett Johnson.

03:15.260 --> 03:19.160
 You were convicted of 39 felonies for cybercrime

03:19.160 --> 03:22.920
 placed on the US most wanted list in 2006,

03:22.920 --> 03:24.700
 escaped from prison.

03:24.700 --> 03:27.240
 You built the first organized cybercrime community

03:27.240 --> 03:30.120
 called Shadow Crew that is the precursor

03:30.120 --> 03:32.880
 to today's darknet and darknet markets.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.280
 And for all this, the US intelligence service

03:36.280 --> 03:39.520
 called you the original internet godfather.

03:39.520 --> 03:42.920
 So first question, how did your career

03:42.920 --> 03:45.300
 as a cybercrime criminal begin?

03:45.300 --> 03:47.920
 My life of crime begins when I'm 10 years old.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.440
 10 years old, man, think about that.

03:49.440 --> 03:51.360
 I mean, you were probably playing the robots

03:51.360 --> 03:52.360
 when you were 10.

03:52.360 --> 03:55.420
 You know, usually kids are doing the Lego bit,

03:55.420 --> 03:57.160
 getting involved with sports, everything else.

03:57.160 --> 04:00.100
 And with me, it wasn't like that.

04:00.100 --> 04:02.360
 With me, I'm from Eastern Kentucky.

04:02.360 --> 04:04.180
 Eastern Kentucky is one of these,

04:05.360 --> 04:08.380
 it's like parts of Texas, parts of Louisiana,

04:08.380 --> 04:11.320
 that if you're not fortunate enough to have a job,

04:11.320 --> 04:13.680
 you may be involved in a scam, hustle, fraud,

04:13.680 --> 04:14.920
 whatever you want to call it, man.

04:14.920 --> 04:19.920
 I was, my parents, my mom was basically

04:20.020 --> 04:22.400
 the captain of the entire fraud industry.

04:22.400 --> 04:25.480
 So this is a woman that at one point,

04:25.480 --> 04:29.760
 she's stealing a 108,000 pound Caterpillar D9 bulldozer,

04:29.760 --> 04:31.280
 tramming it down the road.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.920
 You know, at another point, she's taking a slip

04:32.920 --> 04:35.680
 and falling a convenience store trying to sue the owner.

04:35.680 --> 04:38.920
 We had a neighbor she acted as a pimp for at one point.

04:38.920 --> 04:41.840
 That's my mom, my dad.

04:41.840 --> 04:45.520
 Wait, wait, wait, the neighbor acted as a pimp?

04:45.520 --> 04:47.800
 My mom prostituted, I mean,

04:47.800 --> 04:50.080
 she acted as a pimp for a neighbor.

04:50.080 --> 04:54.680
 Her name was Debbie and my mom used to sell her out.

04:54.680 --> 04:56.740
 Debbie needed money and my mom would find men

04:56.740 --> 04:58.680
 for her to sleep with for cash

04:58.680 --> 05:00.560
 and she'd take a part of the cash.

05:00.560 --> 05:05.080
 So Sauna's like she diversified the methodologies

05:05.080 --> 05:06.940
 by which she hustled.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.840
 Very, had that entrepreneurial spirit.

05:09.840 --> 05:10.680
 Okay.

05:10.680 --> 05:14.120
 You know, we see that a lot with cyber criminals,

05:14.120 --> 05:16.640
 you know, that sense of being that entrepreneur.

05:16.640 --> 05:19.160
 So what was the motivation you think for her?

05:19.160 --> 05:22.600
 Is it money?

05:22.600 --> 05:27.040
 Is it basically the rush of playing with the system

05:27.040 --> 05:30.960
 or being able to know the rules

05:30.960 --> 05:32.920
 and break the rules and get away with it?

05:32.920 --> 05:34.660
 My mom's a complex character.

05:34.660 --> 05:36.880
 She is, there's no one single motivation.

05:36.880 --> 05:40.620
 So my mom was the individual, she's still alive.

05:40.620 --> 05:44.400
 My mom was the individual who tested people.

05:45.360 --> 05:48.040
 She wanted to know how far she could abuse you

05:48.040 --> 05:50.200
 and you come back and still love her.

05:50.200 --> 05:53.940
 So, and that was with every relationship she's ever had.

05:53.940 --> 05:56.120
 She would cheat on the men she was involved with.

05:56.120 --> 05:59.320
 She would abuse her children, me and Denise.

05:59.320 --> 06:00.880
 She would...

06:00.880 --> 06:02.280
 Psychological, physical?

06:02.280 --> 06:05.240
 Oh, it was mental, emotional, physical,

06:06.240 --> 06:07.440
 everything, everything.

06:07.440 --> 06:12.160
 I mean, she used to beat me and Denise with belt buckles,

06:12.160 --> 06:16.160
 you know, and that ended when she was,

06:16.160 --> 06:18.320
 I forgot what we had done.

06:18.320 --> 06:19.160
 It wasn't much.

06:19.160 --> 06:23.260
 I think that it may have been the part

06:23.260 --> 06:26.400
 where she accused me of stealing her marijuana,

06:26.400 --> 06:29.240
 but she was hitting me and Denise.

06:29.240 --> 06:32.680
 We were living in a single wide trailer at that point.

06:32.680 --> 06:33.840
 She was hitting me and Denise.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.920
 We were on the bed trying to get away from it.

06:35.920 --> 06:40.720
 And Denise kicks her through a closet is what happens.

06:40.720 --> 06:43.640
 And Denise stands up and she said,

06:43.640 --> 06:45.720
 you're through hitting me.

06:45.720 --> 06:49.040
 And that was the last time that mom hit us at that point.

06:49.040 --> 06:50.240
 But...

06:50.240 --> 06:51.600
 So sorry to take us there.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.680
 You're, for people who know you

06:53.680 --> 06:55.200
 and people should definitely watch

06:55.200 --> 06:57.100
 some of your lectures online.

06:57.100 --> 07:01.240
 You're extremely charismatic and fun and jolly

07:01.240 --> 07:03.160
 and whatever word you want to use.

07:03.160 --> 07:06.760
 But, you know, if we look at that kind of life,

07:06.760 --> 07:10.900
 there's darkness there, there's a struggle there.

07:10.900 --> 07:12.300
 There's a lot of darkness.

07:12.300 --> 07:16.480
 So if you, how did you feel?

07:16.480 --> 07:20.000
 If you go back to the mind of the kid you were

07:20.000 --> 07:24.200
 with your mom, was there sadness?

07:24.200 --> 07:28.280
 Was there things like depression, self doubt,

07:28.280 --> 07:31.300
 all those kinds of things, or did you see this crime,

07:31.300 --> 07:34.760
 this chaos as ultimately exciting?

07:34.760 --> 07:36.180
 You know, I don't think,

07:36.180 --> 07:37.920
 back then I didn't view it as exciting.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.200
 Now it becomes exciting when I start being involved

07:40.200 --> 07:42.360
 in cyber crime, all right?

07:42.360 --> 07:44.960
 But back then it was simply a means to an end

07:44.960 --> 07:45.800
 was all it was.

07:45.800 --> 07:46.880
 So you take a 10 year old kid

07:46.880 --> 07:49.640
 and the way I get involved in crime is,

07:49.640 --> 07:51.480
 like I said, my mom was the fraudster.

07:51.480 --> 07:53.540
 My dad was a good guy.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.960
 He just forgot he was this good guy.

07:55.960 --> 07:58.400
 You know, he was always, he always had these principles,

07:58.400 --> 08:02.440
 but his issue was is he loved my mom so much,

08:02.440 --> 08:04.840
 he was scared of her leaving.

08:04.840 --> 08:07.980
 So if she wanted to do something, commit crime,

08:07.980 --> 08:10.360
 cheat on him, whatever,

08:10.360 --> 08:14.720
 he would pretty much just put up with it the one instant.

08:14.720 --> 08:16.800
 So, I mean, this woman used to,

08:16.800 --> 08:19.320
 she used to bring men home in front of him,

08:19.320 --> 08:21.160
 tell him that, hey, I'm leaving you.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.160
 I don't love you anymore.

08:22.160 --> 08:24.200
 I want you to die, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.360
 This was my mom.

08:25.360 --> 08:29.240
 There were two instances where the man,

08:30.880 --> 08:33.060
 where he can't take it anymore.

08:33.060 --> 08:34.720
 And the first instance, I was,

08:34.720 --> 08:36.380
 I guess I was seven or eight.

08:36.380 --> 08:38.620
 My sister Denise is a year younger than I am.

08:38.620 --> 08:41.120
 My dad actually files for divorce,

08:41.120 --> 08:42.880
 files for divorce at that point.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.980
 My mom kind of goes crazy.

08:45.880 --> 08:47.520
 My dad, I was with my dad.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.120
 My sister was with my mother

08:49.120 --> 08:50.840
 because that's that Eastern Kentucky mentality.

08:50.840 --> 08:53.620
 You know, men stay with men, women stay with women.

08:53.620 --> 08:57.880
 So he was filing for divorce.

08:57.880 --> 09:00.600
 Me and my dad, we were living in an apartment.

09:00.600 --> 09:03.920
 My mom was living with her grandparents

09:03.920 --> 09:05.440
 and with her parents bouncing back and forth

09:05.440 --> 09:06.280
 between the two.

09:07.520 --> 09:08.840
 And I remember I was sleeping in the bed.

09:08.840 --> 09:09.920
 We had a single wide bed.

09:09.920 --> 09:12.280
 My dad slept on the sofa.

09:12.280 --> 09:13.280
 I woke up one night

09:13.280 --> 09:16.080
 and there was some sort of ruckus in the living room.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.600
 So I wake up and I walk into the living room

09:18.600 --> 09:22.200
 and my mom has a knife to my dad's throat.

09:22.200 --> 09:25.200
 And basically you're not going to steal my son from me.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.920
 My mom was this individual

09:26.920 --> 09:29.760
 that when she knew she went so far,

09:29.760 --> 09:32.320
 like I said, she was always this person that tested.

09:32.320 --> 09:33.680
 What can I do this to you?

09:33.680 --> 09:35.040
 And you'll still come back.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.020
 She knew, she was always also this person

09:39.020 --> 09:42.700
 that if she went too far, she knew it.

09:42.700 --> 09:46.420
 And she would always try to divert that into something else.

09:46.420 --> 09:49.020
 All right, so she knew at that point she'd went too far.

09:49.020 --> 09:50.240
 So what does she do?

09:50.240 --> 09:53.760
 She gets up crying, goes to the bathroom

09:53.760 --> 09:56.800
 and pretends to slit her wrists

09:56.800 --> 10:00.080
 so that my dad Ray will respond to that,

10:00.080 --> 10:02.560
 not respond to what she's just done to him.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.840
 That was my mom in a nutshell.

10:03.840 --> 10:06.140
 She had a history of doing this kind of stuff.

10:07.080 --> 10:09.860
 Motivations as far as fraud with her,

10:09.860 --> 10:14.440
 I think with her it was, she was an LPN.

10:14.440 --> 10:19.440
 She had a very good nurse, but she didn't want to work.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.080
 It was a lot of it.

10:21.080 --> 10:25.400
 So with her, it was easier for her to commit fraud.

10:25.400 --> 10:26.680
 And when I say commit fraud,

10:26.680 --> 10:29.520
 it was against businesses, against people.

10:29.520 --> 10:31.700
 I remember at one point she's buying

10:31.700 --> 10:34.760
 over the counter capsules and emptying the capsules out

10:34.760 --> 10:36.480
 and putting some other crap in there

10:36.480 --> 10:39.280
 and selling at a speed and people were buying it.

10:39.280 --> 10:41.160
 She did anything she could for money.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.520
 And of course I get involved with that.

10:42.520 --> 10:46.960
 What happens is we were in Panama City at that point

10:46.960 --> 10:51.960
 and my mom leaves my dad and the way she left my dad,

10:53.080 --> 10:55.800
 my great grandfather had died.

10:55.800 --> 11:00.040
 My mom tells all three of us, hey, I'm taking the kids

11:00.040 --> 11:01.280
 and we're going back to Eastern Kentucky

11:01.280 --> 11:02.720
 to attend the funeral.

11:02.720 --> 11:05.320
 Well, that was her leaving.

11:05.320 --> 11:06.280
 Me and Denise didn't know it.

11:06.280 --> 11:07.960
 She didn't pack any of our clothes at all.

11:07.960 --> 11:11.000
 She stows her clothes in the trunk of the car

11:11.000 --> 11:13.640
 and she leaves my dad and I don't get to see my dad again

11:13.640 --> 11:16.920
 for I think five, six years, something like that.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.680
 My mom, like I said, she used to bring men home

11:18.680 --> 11:19.900
 in front of my dad.

11:19.900 --> 11:22.800
 She would, he'd sit there and cry and beg her not to do it.

11:22.800 --> 11:23.840
 She'd do it anyway.

11:24.720 --> 11:28.080
 When she leaves him, she kept up that.

11:28.080 --> 11:31.680
 So we were living at my grandparents house.

11:31.680 --> 11:33.480
 My grandfather, he had converted the house.

11:33.480 --> 11:34.760
 He had raised the house up

11:34.760 --> 11:37.280
 and built apartments underneath of it.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.400
 So me and my sister and my mom lived

11:39.400 --> 11:40.860
 in one of the apartments underneath

11:40.860 --> 11:45.480
 and that whole side of the family was just nuts, was nuts.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.260
 My granddad, Paul, he would,

11:49.920 --> 11:54.360
 this is a man that he didn't want you

11:54.360 --> 11:56.340
 to eat any of his food.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.120
 So, you know, there was no such thing

11:58.120 --> 12:00.360
 as me and Denise going upstairs to eat.

12:00.360 --> 12:03.800
 If he found out me and Denise was taking a bath,

12:03.800 --> 12:06.840
 we were allowed to bath and bathe in two inches of water

12:06.840 --> 12:07.880
 one time a week

12:07.880 --> 12:10.040
 because he didn't want to have to pay the water bill.

12:10.040 --> 12:10.880
 There's rules.

12:10.880 --> 12:11.720
 There are rules.

12:11.720 --> 12:14.600
 You know, if you couldn't have the TV on,

12:14.600 --> 12:15.920
 when he went to bed at night,

12:15.920 --> 12:17.800
 you had to have the television, the volume.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.360
 You could watch it, but without volume

12:20.360 --> 12:22.760
 because if he heard it, he would get up

12:22.760 --> 12:23.600
 in the middle of the night

12:23.600 --> 12:25.280
 and he would kick the power breaker,

12:25.280 --> 12:26.960
 turn off all the power on you.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.280
 This is my, this is my, the family, right?

12:29.280 --> 12:32.320
 So my mom, she used to leave me and Denise at home

12:32.320 --> 12:34.480
 for days, man, for days.

12:34.480 --> 12:36.880
 She'd go out and, you know, party.

12:36.880 --> 12:40.360
 And I mean, sometimes she'd take me into these with her.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.740
 We'd wait in the car.

12:41.740 --> 12:43.900
 Sometimes we'd wait in the living room

12:43.900 --> 12:46.220
 as she went and partied and everything else.

12:46.220 --> 12:48.320
 Most of the time she left us at home

12:48.320 --> 12:52.840
 and my entry into crime, Denise walks in one day,

12:52.840 --> 12:54.640
 she's nine years old, man.

12:54.640 --> 12:55.520
 She walks in one day

12:55.520 --> 12:57.880
 and she's got a pack of pork chops in her hand

12:57.880 --> 13:00.200
 and looked at her and I said, where'd you get that?

13:00.200 --> 13:01.940
 She's like, I stole it.

13:01.940 --> 13:04.400
 And you know, it's like, show me how you did that.

13:04.400 --> 13:05.360
 So she takes me over

13:05.360 --> 13:07.040
 and she shows me how she steals food,

13:07.040 --> 13:09.120
 how she's stuffing it down her pants.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.160
 So we start stealing food.

13:10.160 --> 13:11.860
 I'm like, hell yeah, let's do that shit.

13:11.860 --> 13:13.440
 So start stealing food.

13:13.440 --> 13:16.040
 And we get to the point where we're wanting a sandwich.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.560
 Well, you can't stuff a loaf of bread down your pants.

13:18.560 --> 13:20.980
 So there was a Kmart in the shopping center.

13:20.980 --> 13:25.360
 I go over to the Kmart, get a hoodie off the rack,

13:25.360 --> 13:28.480
 take the tags off of it, wear it out, work just fine.

13:28.480 --> 13:29.600
 And the way you steal bread

13:29.600 --> 13:31.440
 is you put the hoodie over your shoulder,

13:31.440 --> 13:32.880
 stuff a loaf of bread down the sleeve

13:32.880 --> 13:34.360
 and you walk out with it.

13:34.360 --> 13:35.400
 So we started doing that.

13:35.400 --> 13:36.840
 How'd you figure that out?

13:36.840 --> 13:38.160
 Just thought pattern.

13:38.160 --> 13:43.160
 So there's like strategic thinking here.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.320
 Yeah, you know, you can't wear the hoodie

13:45.320 --> 13:46.400
 and put the bread down here

13:46.400 --> 13:48.840
 cause you might mash the bread when you zip it up

13:48.840 --> 13:49.680
 or they might notice the bread.

13:49.680 --> 13:50.520
 Yeah, we have to think through that.

13:50.520 --> 13:51.740
 You gotta think through it.

13:51.740 --> 13:53.800
 But you gotta realize by this point,

13:53.800 --> 13:57.120
 I'm already seeing what my parents are doing.

13:57.120 --> 13:59.520
 You know, I'm already seeing the plotting.

13:59.520 --> 14:01.000
 That kind of puzzle solving

14:01.000 --> 14:02.760
 was something you were already developing yourself

14:02.760 --> 14:04.200
 individually cause you're pretty young.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.840
 Yeah, 10 years old, pretty young.

14:05.840 --> 14:08.400
 But seeing how they act, how they respond to things.

14:08.400 --> 14:11.280
 And my mom, I guess you could call it a good thing,

14:11.280 --> 14:14.800
 they never kept any of that hidden from the kids.

14:14.800 --> 14:17.720
 You know, there was no discussions behind closed doors.

14:17.720 --> 14:19.300
 All that happened in front of everybody.

14:19.300 --> 14:22.320
 And from your young minds perspective,

14:22.320 --> 14:25.920
 seeing that kind of crime, you basically,

14:25.920 --> 14:27.660
 you know, a lot of us kind of grow up

14:27.660 --> 14:29.820
 thinking there's rules you're not supposed to break.

14:29.820 --> 14:31.940
 If you see other humans breaking those rules,

14:31.940 --> 14:35.680
 then you realize those rules are just human made.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.120
 But it gets worse than that.

14:37.120 --> 14:41.920
 I was in an environment where there were no decent people.

14:42.880 --> 14:45.040
 I didn't really meet my first decent person

14:45.040 --> 14:47.160
 until I was 16 years old.

14:47.160 --> 14:48.000
 Who's that?

14:48.000 --> 14:49.920
 That was a high school teacher.

14:49.920 --> 14:54.480
 So what happens is, you know, we start shoplifting food.

14:54.480 --> 14:56.720
 My mom finds out that we've been stealing stuff

14:56.720 --> 14:59.040
 and you know, she joins us.

14:59.040 --> 14:59.880
 What's that?

14:59.880 --> 15:00.880
 She joins us.

15:00.880 --> 15:02.780
 Yeah, she comes in, you know, I've got the television,

15:02.780 --> 15:05.120
 I've got the Atari 2600, play the hell out of it.

15:05.120 --> 15:05.960
 Oh my God.

15:05.960 --> 15:06.880
 She starts seeing this shit.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.020
 She's like, where'd this come from?

15:08.020 --> 15:09.200
 And I'm like, well, we found it.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.360
 She's like, you didn't find that.

15:10.360 --> 15:13.520
 Denise, Denise stands up, we stole it.

15:13.520 --> 15:16.680
 My mom, show me how you did that.

15:16.680 --> 15:19.520
 And she gets her mom too, to join in.

15:19.520 --> 15:20.760
 And she used to run me and Denise

15:20.760 --> 15:21.980
 as these little shoplifters.

15:21.980 --> 15:24.520
 We'd take, you know, we'd steal stuff for her.

15:24.520 --> 15:27.760
 We would distract security

15:27.760 --> 15:30.840
 and her and my grandmother would steal stuff.

15:30.840 --> 15:32.380
 They got caught doing that.

15:32.380 --> 15:34.920
 But that's the entry into crime.

15:34.920 --> 15:39.920
 And Denise, you know, I'm adamant and I kind of mean it.

15:41.280 --> 15:45.760
 But the truth is I say, and I do mean it,

15:45.760 --> 15:49.760
 that I'm responsible for my choices as an adult, all right?

15:49.760 --> 15:52.240
 I believe that when you're a child, you can't control that.

15:52.240 --> 15:55.020
 The adults in your environment control what you do.

15:55.020 --> 15:55.860
 All right?

15:55.860 --> 15:58.900
 Once you're an adult though, your choices are yours.

15:58.900 --> 16:01.760
 Now that being said, there's some,

16:03.700 --> 16:06.060
 you can't dismiss that childhood

16:07.940 --> 16:10.880
 influencing what I did as an adult.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.140
 You can't do that.

16:12.140 --> 16:14.960
 I mean, it was kind of written on slate that,

16:14.960 --> 16:18.280
 hey, this guy's gonna be this guy when he grows up.

16:18.280 --> 16:20.740
 That's like sometimes that one person you meet,

16:20.740 --> 16:23.800
 that decent person can turn the tide of your life.

16:23.800 --> 16:24.640
 Absolutely, absolutely.

16:24.640 --> 16:26.600
 So what happens is, you know, the abuse,

16:26.600 --> 16:30.520
 everything continues on, when I'm 15,

16:30.520 --> 16:33.520
 my dad was in Panama City, Florida.

16:33.520 --> 16:36.680
 My mom was in, you know, we were in Hazard, Kentucky.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.520
 She was dating this guy.

16:40.520 --> 16:45.520
 My mom was this woman that the abuse would,

16:46.280 --> 16:49.500
 it was crazy abuse, man, just crazy stuff.

16:49.500 --> 16:52.040
 She would tell me and my sister, you know,

16:52.040 --> 16:55.080
 that she gave up her life for us,

16:55.080 --> 16:57.680
 that she was gonna leave one day and never come back,

16:57.680 --> 17:00.240
 that we'd find her dead in a ditch someplace.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.080
 She'd go out and date these men and she'd come back

17:02.080 --> 17:05.680
 and she'd talk about how these men were abusing her.

17:05.680 --> 17:07.560
 You know, so she'd be dating this guy

17:07.560 --> 17:10.680
 and she'd come back and she'd, you know,

17:10.680 --> 17:13.080
 start talking about how he had tried to rape her,

17:13.080 --> 17:14.640
 you know, trying to get me to respond to that.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.100
 And I would respond to that.

17:16.100 --> 17:18.520
 Make no doubt, I would respond to that.

17:18.520 --> 17:21.320
 Well, what happens is, and I knew that,

17:21.320 --> 17:23.920
 I don't know if I knew it was abuse at that age, all right,

17:23.920 --> 17:25.840
 but I knew things were fucked up.

17:25.840 --> 17:29.200
 And I was talking to my dad in Panama City

17:29.200 --> 17:30.840
 and I really had it in my head

17:30.840 --> 17:35.480
 that I was gonna go down and live with my dad.

17:35.480 --> 17:40.480
 And I called my dad one day.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.920
 I was set to go to, me and my cousins

17:42.920 --> 17:45.240
 were gonna go see Return of the Jedi.

17:45.240 --> 17:48.160
 It had came out again in the theaters.

17:48.160 --> 17:50.480
 So I called my dad, it was a Sunday,

17:50.480 --> 17:52.840
 called my dad and he told me,

17:52.840 --> 17:54.480
 he had either gotten married

17:54.480 --> 17:56.880
 or he was about to get married to this woman.

17:56.880 --> 17:59.480
 And basically Brett Johnson

17:59.480 --> 18:01.200
 wasn't gonna go down to Florida.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.680
 You know, I was gonna stay in Hazard.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.060
 I had to call my dad from payphone,

18:05.060 --> 18:09.440
 but the result of that was I walked him into a hospital,

18:11.320 --> 18:15.560
 got in an elevator and a woman got in the elevator

18:15.560 --> 18:18.160
 at the same time and I snapped

18:18.160 --> 18:21.200
 and beat the hell out of her right there.

18:21.200 --> 18:26.200
 And I was 15, didn't really know what the fuck happened.

18:27.320 --> 18:29.000
 Didn't really know, but.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.520
 Just anger came from somewhere.

18:30.520 --> 18:32.080
 Yeah, yeah.

18:32.080 --> 18:37.080
 And you know, the elevator,

18:37.640 --> 18:40.000
 beat the hell out of this lady.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.520
 Turned out she looked a shitload like my mom,

18:43.760 --> 18:48.760
 but the elevator doors open.

18:48.760 --> 18:51.420
 And one of the security guards,

18:51.420 --> 18:53.500
 I played basketball with his son.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.140
 So he saw me immediately.

18:55.140 --> 18:58.620
 I knocked the hell out of him, took off running,

18:58.620 --> 19:02.940
 made it back to the house where my grandparents were.

19:02.940 --> 19:04.020
 They didn't know what had happened.

19:04.020 --> 19:06.580
 So I didn't say anything.

19:07.500 --> 19:10.140
 About an hour later, Kentucky state police,

19:10.140 --> 19:13.820
 they pull up in the front yard and two of them get out

19:13.820 --> 19:16.620
 and I'm sitting on the front porch and me and my cousins are

19:16.620 --> 19:18.940
 and they start walking up where everybody starts walking

19:18.940 --> 19:19.780
 out of the house.

19:19.780 --> 19:21.700
 And I'm like, I just remember saying, what do you want?

19:21.700 --> 19:22.520
 What do you want?

19:22.520 --> 19:23.900
 Well, you know what they wanted.

19:23.900 --> 19:27.820
 They wanted to arrest Brett Johnson and they arrested me.

19:27.820 --> 19:29.740
 I went in and I told them everything.

19:31.340 --> 19:33.220
 Spent three months in a county jail.

19:33.220 --> 19:37.580
 They didn't have juvenile facilities in that county.

19:37.580 --> 19:42.440
 So I spent three months in solitary, went to trial,

19:42.440 --> 19:44.740
 pled guilty to assault in the first degree.

19:44.740 --> 19:48.540
 The judge sentenced me to time served

19:48.540 --> 19:50.180
 and a psychological evaluation

19:50.180 --> 19:52.640
 where they sent me to Louisville, Kentucky.

19:54.020 --> 19:55.780
 Spent 30 days up there and they cut me loose.

19:55.780 --> 19:59.180
 They wanted me to have counseling after that

19:59.180 --> 20:02.740
 and never went to counseling.

20:02.740 --> 20:05.540
 You know, I wanted to, but mom was like, don't need it.

20:05.540 --> 20:08.140
 And so never went to counseling.

20:08.140 --> 20:13.140
 And I became this pariah in the county. It's crazy, man.

20:16.780 --> 20:21.580
 I mean, not a day goes by that I don't think about that.

20:21.580 --> 20:23.460
 That moment in the elevator.

20:23.460 --> 20:24.580
 Yeah.

20:24.580 --> 20:29.140
 And what happens is, you know, you're 15.

20:29.140 --> 20:30.520
 Fuck man, you're 15.

20:31.580 --> 20:34.660
 So I go back to the high school that I was in

20:34.660 --> 20:38.700
 and I'm this piece of shit.

20:38.700 --> 20:41.460
 So everybody, you're not the outcast.

20:41.460 --> 20:43.280
 Everybody knows.

20:43.280 --> 20:47.120
 So I moved, we moved, we were in Whitesburg at that point.

20:47.120 --> 20:52.120
 I finished up the year there and moved back to Perry County,

20:52.260 --> 20:54.220
 which is where Hazard is.

20:55.140 --> 20:57.940
 So we moved there and they've got three high schools here.

20:57.940 --> 21:00.260
 They've got MC Napier, they've got Hazard High School

21:00.260 --> 21:02.700
 and then they've got Dills Combs High School.

21:02.700 --> 21:06.100
 So I was within, me and Denise were within

21:07.500 --> 21:09.360
 half mile of MC Napier.

21:10.820 --> 21:12.700
 Show up there the first day of school

21:13.700 --> 21:16.100
 and I met me and my mom and my sister

21:16.100 --> 21:19.500
 were walking into the school and the kids won't let me in.

21:20.640 --> 21:25.320
 The kids stand out there, he's not coming in.

21:26.740 --> 21:29.240
 So my mom starts raising hell and I'm like,

21:29.240 --> 21:30.780
 nah, let's just go, let's go.

21:30.780 --> 21:33.380
 So from there it was, we went down to the city school,

21:33.380 --> 21:36.940
 Hazard and the principal tells my mom,

21:36.940 --> 21:39.380
 Denise can come, he can't.

21:40.540 --> 21:43.660
 So my mom wants to raise hell and I'm like, no,

21:43.660 --> 21:45.700
 let's just take me to this other school.

21:45.700 --> 21:48.340
 So this other school was like 15 miles away

21:48.340 --> 21:52.460
 and country high school.

21:55.320 --> 21:57.140
 So I go there and they accept me

21:57.140 --> 21:59.220
 and I walked in the first day

21:59.220 --> 22:01.820
 and this English teacher

22:04.020 --> 22:07.220
 name's Carol Combs, I walked in

22:07.220 --> 22:11.940
 and handed her the paper, she was my homeroom teacher

22:11.940 --> 22:14.380
 and she heard this voice,

22:14.380 --> 22:15.820
 that is the way she explains it today,

22:15.820 --> 22:19.660
 she heard this voice and she looks up

22:19.660 --> 22:24.020
 and she was like, son, have you ever done any drama before?

22:24.020 --> 22:27.580
 And I'm like, no maam,

22:27.580 --> 22:29.240
 but I'm interested in the academic team,

22:29.240 --> 22:31.340
 I was this quick recall guy, right?

22:31.340 --> 22:33.080
 And she's like, no.

22:33.080 --> 22:35.760
 She's like, drama.

22:37.580 --> 22:39.980
 I'm like, no, I'm not interested in theater,

22:39.980 --> 22:41.980
 I'm interested in academics.

22:41.980 --> 22:44.520
 Well, she was the head of the drama department

22:44.520 --> 22:46.040
 and head of the academics department.

22:46.040 --> 22:48.500
 So the deal was, tell you what,

22:48.500 --> 22:50.440
 you can get on the academics team

22:50.440 --> 22:53.100
 if you start with theater too.

22:53.100 --> 22:54.780
 And I was like, okay.

22:54.780 --> 22:56.780
 So what happens is she was the only,

22:56.780 --> 22:58.700
 she was the first decent person I met in my life

22:58.700 --> 23:01.820
 and she became this kind of surrogate mother to me.

23:01.820 --> 23:03.680
 So under her tutelage,

23:04.740 --> 23:08.540
 I become one of the top academic team guys in the state.

23:09.740 --> 23:11.380
 Around there, I was captain of the team,

23:11.380 --> 23:15.740
 I was this just scourge across all the counties

23:15.740 --> 23:16.660
 in that part of Kentucky.

23:16.660 --> 23:20.080
 If we had a meet, it was like,

23:20.080 --> 23:21.780
 Jesus Christ, that's Brett Johnson.

23:21.780 --> 23:26.580
 And it was like, she used to tell people

23:26.580 --> 23:29.900
 they would, the high school that I came from was Whitesburg

23:29.900 --> 23:32.820
 and the first time that Whitesburg came against us,

23:32.820 --> 23:35.740
 she told me, I was talking to her about a year ago

23:35.740 --> 23:37.920
 and she told me, she's like, Brett,

23:37.920 --> 23:40.420
 she said, that first meet against Whitesburg,

23:40.420 --> 23:45.180
 she said, the captain came in, looked at you and said,

23:45.180 --> 23:47.580
 oh, you've got that Johnson boy on your team?

23:47.580 --> 23:52.240
 And she said, my response was that Johnson boy is our team.

23:52.240 --> 23:57.240
 So, but I did that and then with theater,

23:57.740 --> 24:00.540
 I ended up, my senior year,

24:00.540 --> 24:04.060
 I won best actor and actress in the state.

24:04.060 --> 24:05.940
 Only guy to ever do that in the state.

24:05.940 --> 24:08.920
 So, did pretty well, man, did pretty well.

24:08.920 --> 24:11.900
 Had scholarships coming out of high school

24:11.900 --> 24:14.460
 and everything else and I'm the idiot that turned them down.

24:14.460 --> 24:15.700
 Ask you a funny question.

24:15.700 --> 24:16.620
 Yeah.

24:16.620 --> 24:18.300
 You'd make a hell of a, I mean,

24:18.300 --> 24:20.220
 of all the many things you could probably do,

24:20.220 --> 24:23.140
 you would make a hell of a actor.

24:23.140 --> 24:24.820
 I'm very good on stage.

24:24.820 --> 24:26.020
 I'm very good on stage.

24:26.020 --> 24:28.780
 Have you acted professionally anywhere or not?

24:28.780 --> 24:29.620
 Not professionally.

24:29.620 --> 24:31.900
 We've done the college circuit and stuff like that.

24:31.900 --> 24:35.900
 What happened was is, so I turned down the scholarships,

24:38.260 --> 24:40.140
 you know, scared of leaving, I guess is what it was.

24:40.140 --> 24:41.820
 Started in community college

24:41.820 --> 24:44.580
 and the community college there hires

24:44.580 --> 24:46.340
 a new theater director out of California.

24:46.340 --> 24:48.020
 Well, he knew the guy

24:48.020 --> 24:50.900
 that ran the San Jose State Theater program.

24:50.900 --> 24:53.020
 A guy named Edward Emmanuel was his name.

24:53.020 --> 24:56.340
 His claim to fame, he had written the Three Ninjas movie.

24:56.340 --> 24:58.460
 Remember that, the three little ninja kids

24:58.460 --> 25:00.780
 back in the eighties, he had written this damn film

25:00.780 --> 25:02.900
 and it had made a shitload of money.

25:02.900 --> 25:06.140
 So, he invites Ed Emmanuel to come down and see the play

25:06.140 --> 25:09.120
 and Ed had written this Civil War piece.

25:09.120 --> 25:11.440
 So, we put that on.

25:11.440 --> 25:13.660
 I was doing like, it was a multiple role thing.

25:13.660 --> 25:16.140
 I was doing like 18 different roles in the show.

25:16.140 --> 25:19.580
 So, Ed sees the show and he was like, scholarship.

25:19.580 --> 25:20.780
 He said, look, he said,

25:20.780 --> 25:22.660
 right now you're a big fish in a small pond.

25:22.660 --> 25:24.180
 We'll make you a big fish in a big pot.

25:24.180 --> 25:25.620
 And I was like, deal.

25:25.620 --> 25:27.580
 So, I took the scholarship, man.

25:27.580 --> 25:29.280
 And he was like, I'll be back in two weeks.

25:29.280 --> 25:30.380
 So, he flies out.

25:30.380 --> 25:32.820
 Two weeks later, this guy flies back in.

25:32.820 --> 25:35.400
 He drives down to where I'm living.

25:35.400 --> 25:39.580
 I'm out shooting ball with one of my cousins and friends.

25:39.580 --> 25:42.620
 He pulls up and he gets out of the car

25:42.620 --> 25:43.940
 and I was like, I'm walking over to him.

25:43.940 --> 25:45.820
 I was like, hey man, I'll walk you in.

25:45.820 --> 25:47.020
 You can meet my parents.

25:47.020 --> 25:48.540
 He's like, no, I got it.

25:48.540 --> 25:49.540
 I was like, okay.

25:49.540 --> 25:50.500
 So, I keep shooting ball.

25:50.500 --> 25:54.780
 He walks in the house, stays about 15 minutes,

25:54.780 --> 25:58.620
 walks out, white as a sheet, doesn't say a word to me,

25:58.620 --> 26:00.980
 gets in the car, leaves.

26:00.980 --> 26:02.760
 I don't hear from him again.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.780
 Had no idea what went on.

26:04.780 --> 26:06.580
 Takes me a couple of weeks.

26:06.580 --> 26:10.620
 What happened is my mom, he walks in and introduces himself.

26:10.620 --> 26:12.260
 My mom pulls a knife on the guy.

26:13.420 --> 26:14.780
 I will kill you.

26:14.780 --> 26:17.700
 You are not going to steal my goddamn son from me.

26:17.700 --> 26:19.340
 Scares the guy to death.

26:19.340 --> 26:24.340
 He bugs out and kind of broke my spirit at that point.

26:24.340 --> 26:27.020
 I was like, okay.

26:27.020 --> 26:32.020
 So, went into, just full fledged into scams,

26:32.940 --> 26:34.080
 crimes, everything else.

26:34.080 --> 26:37.220
 I had already been, when I was a minor,

26:37.220 --> 26:39.100
 I'd already been kind of brought up

26:39.100 --> 26:40.740
 on that side of the family with the crimes

26:40.740 --> 26:41.580
 that they were doing.

26:41.580 --> 26:45.380
 My mom was drug trafficking, the pimp stuff,

26:45.380 --> 26:48.780
 illegally mining coal, charity fraud.

26:48.780 --> 26:50.100
 Illegally mining coal?

26:50.100 --> 26:51.380
 Yeah, wildcatting coal.

26:51.380 --> 26:52.220
 So, you...

26:52.220 --> 26:53.060
 Can you explain that?

26:53.060 --> 26:55.980
 Yeah, so, to properly mine coal,

26:55.980 --> 26:58.580
 you have to get a permit, all right?

26:58.580 --> 27:00.460
 Eastern Kentucky, a lot of people don't,

27:00.460 --> 27:02.580
 they can't afford the permits.

27:02.580 --> 27:04.340
 They can get them a piece of equipment.

27:04.340 --> 27:06.420
 You get a dozer or a loader or whatever you're going to get

27:06.420 --> 27:08.260
 or an auger or what have you.

27:08.260 --> 27:10.740
 So, you start mining, but you don't get the permit.

27:10.740 --> 27:12.900
 So, you don't have to do the, you don't have to pay.

27:12.900 --> 27:15.740
 Back then, it was like $3,500 for a two acre permit

27:15.740 --> 27:17.620
 or $5,000 for a two acre permit.

27:17.620 --> 27:20.540
 Let you strip mine the coal on that.

27:20.540 --> 27:22.780
 Then you have to pay for the reclamation on top of that.

27:22.780 --> 27:25.740
 So, once you uncover the pit, take the coal out,

27:25.740 --> 27:28.700
 you have to cover back up the pit, sow grass,

27:28.700 --> 27:30.420
 make sure everything is environmentally friendly.

27:30.420 --> 27:32.940
 You got a silt pond, everything else at that point.

27:32.940 --> 27:35.060
 So, the whole idea is you buy an acre of land

27:35.060 --> 27:36.940
 or some area of land and then you can,

27:36.940 --> 27:38.580
 there's a whole process you're supposed to go through.

27:38.580 --> 27:39.580
 Entire process.

27:39.580 --> 27:41.940
 How many people involved in a mining,

27:41.940 --> 27:43.980
 the smallest number of people required

27:43.980 --> 27:45.060
 for a mining operation?

27:45.060 --> 27:46.820
 You can do it with three or four people.

27:46.820 --> 27:47.660
 Okay.

27:47.660 --> 27:48.480
 So, you've got your loader operator,

27:48.480 --> 27:49.900
 you've got your dozer operator.

27:49.900 --> 27:52.860
 You need, you can farm out the trucking to someone

27:52.860 --> 27:56.540
 if you need that or trucking company if you need to do that.

27:56.540 --> 27:58.700
 Then you've got your, whoever owns the business as well.

27:58.700 --> 28:01.780
 So, very few people can run an operation like that

28:01.780 --> 28:04.700
 and profit fairly well as long as

28:04.700 --> 28:07.100
 you don't have to do the reclamation,

28:07.100 --> 28:08.860
 all that crap on top of it, all right?

28:08.860 --> 28:10.900
 The reclamation gets pretty expensive.

28:10.900 --> 28:12.900
 So, if you're uncovering a pit of coal,

28:14.460 --> 28:18.100
 a pit, so a ton of coal is basically about 36 cubic inches

28:18.100 --> 28:20.700
 is what a 2000 pounds of coal weighs

28:20.700 --> 28:21.860
 if you're in Eastern Kentucky

28:21.860 --> 28:24.420
 because it's at the weight of the bituminous coal

28:24.420 --> 28:25.260
 and everything.

28:25.260 --> 28:26.580
 The fact that you know this is awesome.

28:26.580 --> 28:31.580
 The fact that you know exactly the volume

28:32.140 --> 28:34.340
 of a ton of coal, I mean, it's great.

28:34.340 --> 28:35.500
 Yeah, you learn this shit, right?

28:35.500 --> 28:36.620
 Can you rattle this shit off?

28:36.620 --> 28:40.220
 So, you uncover the pit and then you've got to sell the pit.

28:40.220 --> 28:41.860
 Well, the thing is, is that,

28:41.860 --> 28:43.260
 where are you gonna sell the coal?

28:43.260 --> 28:45.700
 Well, you sell it to one of these other coal tipples

28:45.700 --> 28:48.660
 that knows that they're buying the shit illegally.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.620
 So, back then a ton of coal was,

28:50.620 --> 28:54.140
 they'd give you like 36 bucks per ton is what that is.

28:54.140 --> 28:56.700
 And you'd have to go out and you'd test the BTUs on it.

28:56.700 --> 28:58.980
 You take a sample to the lab, test the BTUs,

28:58.980 --> 28:59.820
 you take that into the company.

28:59.820 --> 29:00.820
 What BTU?

29:00.820 --> 29:02.220
 British Thermal Unit.

29:02.220 --> 29:04.780
 So, you'd test what the BTU on the coal was.

29:04.780 --> 29:05.860
 How pure the coal is.

29:05.860 --> 29:08.900
 How pure the coal is, what BTU it burns at.

29:08.900 --> 29:12.540
 Back then, a good BTU was around 12.9

29:12.540 --> 29:14.100
 was what you'd get, all right?

29:14.100 --> 29:17.020
 So, 12.9 coal, $36 a ton.

29:17.020 --> 29:19.420
 You'd take that sample over to the coal tipple.

29:19.420 --> 29:21.540
 They'd say, okay, we'll buy this for you.

29:21.540 --> 29:23.140
 How many trucks you got or how many tons you got?

29:23.140 --> 29:24.700
 And you'd say, this is what we've got.

29:24.700 --> 29:26.180
 Then you'd hire the trucking company.

29:26.180 --> 29:29.900
 And where you get it out because you've got the agents

29:29.900 --> 29:32.260
 that are looking for you by this point

29:32.260 --> 29:36.020
 because the people that you've bought the rights

29:36.020 --> 29:37.660
 to whoever the landowner is,

29:37.660 --> 29:41.380
 you said you're gonna give them $2 a ton or whatever this is.

29:41.380 --> 29:42.500
 Well, the other people there,

29:42.500 --> 29:45.220
 are you paying them off or are you not?

29:45.220 --> 29:47.060
 Well, if you're not paying them off, guess what?

29:47.060 --> 29:49.940
 They know your ass is mining it illegally.

29:49.940 --> 29:50.980
 They're gonna report you.

29:50.980 --> 29:53.220
 Well, all of a sudden, you've got all these inspectors

29:53.220 --> 29:54.420
 that are coming around and everything.

29:54.420 --> 29:55.940
 Hey, we know what you're doing.

29:55.940 --> 29:57.540
 So, they're looking for you to get the pit out.

29:57.540 --> 29:58.940
 So, when do you get the pit out?

29:58.940 --> 30:00.140
 Right in dead of night.

30:00.140 --> 30:02.940
 So, you're loading it up two o clock in the morning,

30:02.940 --> 30:04.740
 hauling this ass out is what you're doing.

30:04.740 --> 30:06.260
 You sell it out from there.

30:06.260 --> 30:07.100
 So.

30:07.100 --> 30:08.940
 And your mom ran operations like this?

30:08.940 --> 30:10.220
 Yeah, yeah.

30:10.220 --> 30:12.500
 And you said you worked the mine too when you were younger?

30:12.500 --> 30:14.180
 Yeah, I learned how to run a loader, run a dozer,

30:14.180 --> 30:18.700
 learn how to clean off a pit, everything like that.

30:18.700 --> 30:22.020
 So, this is the lifestyle you grow up in.

30:22.020 --> 30:23.540
 You learn how to do this stuff.

30:23.540 --> 30:27.100
 And so, I knew how to do charity fraud as well,

30:27.100 --> 30:28.540
 insurance fraud, so.

30:28.540 --> 30:29.660
 Charity fraud.

30:29.660 --> 30:31.820
 Can we break down some of these?

30:31.820 --> 30:34.580
 Charity fraud, it's much more romantic than what it sounds.

30:34.580 --> 30:39.340
 It was basically, it was basically standing beside the road

30:39.340 --> 30:42.500
 with a sign and a bucket taking up collections

30:42.500 --> 30:44.860
 for homeless shelters, for abused women,

30:44.860 --> 30:47.540
 for children, stuff like that.

30:47.540 --> 30:49.660
 Then later on, I branched off.

30:49.660 --> 30:51.020
 When I started off on my own,

30:51.020 --> 30:53.380
 I would set up my own charity company

30:53.380 --> 30:55.140
 and do some telemarketing and go on by

30:55.140 --> 30:57.100
 and collect checks and things like that.

30:57.100 --> 30:58.140
 We're gonna talk about that.

30:58.140 --> 30:59.860
 But actually, can we just step back

30:59.860 --> 31:04.260
 and talk about your mom and your dad?

31:04.260 --> 31:08.100
 Given all of that, given all the abuse,

31:08.980 --> 31:12.300
 the complex ways that she played with love,

31:12.300 --> 31:15.700
 to see how far she can push you and the people around her,

31:15.700 --> 31:16.940
 and they still love her.

31:18.220 --> 31:20.460
 Today, do you love her?

31:20.460 --> 31:22.660
 You know, I called my dad yesterday.

31:22.660 --> 31:24.500
 My dad, he's dying now.

31:24.500 --> 31:25.500
 He's got a heart condition.

31:25.500 --> 31:27.340
 He's not gonna get the operation to fix it.

31:27.340 --> 31:29.220
 So he's like, fuck it, I'm ready to go.

31:29.220 --> 31:30.420
 And I'm like, I looked at him,

31:30.420 --> 31:32.660
 because hell, I'm 52 now.

31:32.660 --> 31:35.180
 Prior to 52, I'd have been like, no, you need to do this.

31:35.180 --> 31:38.340
 But I looked at him and I was like, I understand.

31:38.340 --> 31:39.420
 I understand.

31:39.420 --> 31:40.460
 You're done.

31:40.460 --> 31:42.780
 And so he's not gonna get the operation.

31:42.780 --> 31:44.220
 I was talking to him yesterday and he asked me,

31:44.220 --> 31:45.780
 he's like, have you seen your mom?

31:45.780 --> 31:47.100
 And I was like, dad, I've not talked to her

31:47.100 --> 31:48.660
 for about two years.

31:48.660 --> 31:52.620
 And I told him, I was like, I love my mom,

31:52.620 --> 31:54.900
 but my mom is not a good person.

31:54.900 --> 31:55.740
 She's not.

31:55.740 --> 31:59.180
 And he told me, I was talking to him on the phone yesterday,

31:59.180 --> 32:01.780
 and he told me that it took him several years

32:01.780 --> 32:03.260
 to really understand that.

32:03.260 --> 32:04.780
 You know, he loved her too,

32:04.780 --> 32:07.460
 but it takes, when you're getting abused like that,

32:07.460 --> 32:09.940
 especially my dad, my dad came from a good family,

32:09.940 --> 32:13.300
 everything else, and, you know, upstanding family.

32:13.300 --> 32:17.300
 And I think that when you're that victim of abuse,

32:18.460 --> 32:20.300
 you know, you've never seen it before,

32:20.300 --> 32:23.260
 you've never encountered it, and then it happens,

32:23.260 --> 32:25.300
 well, you're like that frog in water all of a sudden.

32:25.300 --> 32:28.260
 You know, you get to the point where it gradually increases

32:28.260 --> 32:30.100
 until how do you get out of it?

32:30.100 --> 32:32.820
 Everybody else sees what's happening, but you don't.

32:32.820 --> 32:34.740
 I grew up in that environment though, you know,

32:34.740 --> 32:39.060
 so it took me a long time to come to terms with that.

32:39.060 --> 32:42.020
 My sister came to terms with it long before I did.

32:42.020 --> 32:44.180
 You know, my sister, she's been a decade

32:44.180 --> 32:45.860
 without talking to my mom,

32:45.860 --> 32:48.380
 like she had tried to commit suicide, I didn't know that.

32:48.380 --> 32:51.740
 What got me so bad is she said at one point

32:51.740 --> 32:55.020
 that she always thought someone was gonna come in

32:55.020 --> 32:58.180
 and save us, and my response, just immediate response,

32:58.180 --> 32:59.900
 not even thinking about it, my response was,

32:59.900 --> 33:02.500
 well, Denise, I knew no one ever was.

33:02.500 --> 33:06.060
 And looking at things now,

33:06.060 --> 33:09.420
 I think that's where our paths diverged.

33:10.500 --> 33:13.220
 Me, it was, if you wanna do it,

33:13.220 --> 33:14.500
 if anybody's gonna take care of you,

33:14.500 --> 33:15.980
 you gotta take care of yourself.

33:15.980 --> 33:16.820
 You're on your own.

33:16.820 --> 33:20.140
 You're on your own, you know, it's up to you.

33:20.140 --> 33:24.100
 And Denise has always been that child

33:24.100 --> 33:27.780
 that has expected someone to come in and save her.

33:27.780 --> 33:31.380
 Well, and almost like it's all going to be okay, somebody.

33:31.380 --> 33:33.580
 Yeah, and I knew it wasn't.

33:33.580 --> 33:34.420
 No, no, you go.

33:34.420 --> 33:35.260
 Unless you.

33:35.260 --> 33:38.460
 Unless you make it okay, it ain't gonna be okay.

33:38.460 --> 33:40.820
 So, you know, I was.

33:40.820 --> 33:45.220
 Are you able to forgive her, your mom?

33:45.220 --> 33:49.580
 My boundary with my mom, the reason I've not spoken with her,

33:49.580 --> 33:54.580
 over two years ago, I started this legal career of mine.

33:55.780 --> 33:57.540
 I've been the guy who has,

33:57.540 --> 34:01.420
 I spent a lot of time thinking about my past

34:01.420 --> 34:04.260
 and those choices and what brought those choices around.

34:04.260 --> 34:06.780
 So I'm big about taking responsibility for my actions.

34:06.780 --> 34:07.620
 I truly am.

34:07.620 --> 34:09.540
 I think it's really important you have to do that.

34:09.540 --> 34:12.540
 Well, my mom, not so much.

34:12.540 --> 34:14.740
 So I was talking to her, you know,

34:14.740 --> 34:16.300
 and I would start saying, you know,

34:16.300 --> 34:19.300
 she would start the conversation talking about,

34:19.300 --> 34:20.260
 she didn't understand

34:20.260 --> 34:22.300
 why Denise wouldn't speak to her anymore.

34:22.300 --> 34:24.180
 That was one of her tropes.

34:24.180 --> 34:26.020
 So, and my response started to become,

34:26.020 --> 34:28.780
 well, because you were the abuser

34:28.780 --> 34:31.100
 and you spent your life doing that to her.

34:31.100 --> 34:34.340
 So it's more healthy for her not to talk to you.

34:34.340 --> 34:37.900
 So she's still not able to see the flaws

34:37.900 --> 34:40.140
 in her ways of the past.

34:40.140 --> 34:41.140
 No, not at all.

34:41.140 --> 34:44.660
 So my ultimatum to my mom was, look,

34:44.660 --> 34:46.860
 when you're able to admit

34:46.860 --> 34:49.980
 that you abused the people in your life,

34:49.980 --> 34:51.460
 accept that responsibility

34:51.460 --> 34:55.780
 and be able to discuss it with me, we'll have a talk.

34:55.780 --> 34:58.500
 Other than that, I don't want to talk to you anymore.

34:58.500 --> 35:00.500
 So for the first year it was, you know,

35:00.500 --> 35:03.700
 calling, cussing my wife out, cussing me out,

35:04.900 --> 35:07.580
 you know, I don't need you, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

35:07.580 --> 35:09.580
 And then finally it started to taper off

35:09.580 --> 35:12.260
 and she's never really contacted me after that point.

35:12.260 --> 35:17.260
 And your dad is dying.

35:18.020 --> 35:21.140
 What do you take from the way he's taken on death?

35:21.140 --> 35:22.940
 Just saying, fuck it.

35:22.940 --> 35:25.460
 You know, it's the man.

35:25.460 --> 35:27.740
 And what have you learned from your dad?

35:27.740 --> 35:30.100
 What do you love about your dad?

35:30.100 --> 35:33.140
 He's one of these guys that, you know, like I told him,

35:34.380 --> 35:37.700
 I told my dad about the abuse and everything else.

35:37.700 --> 35:39.060
 And there was a point.

35:39.060 --> 35:41.220
 So, you know, I told you about the elevator stuff,

35:41.220 --> 35:43.660
 but before that, man, it was,

35:44.900 --> 35:47.980
 it took me 40 years to talk about that,

35:47.980 --> 35:51.980
 but it also took me 40 years to talk about,

35:53.820 --> 35:58.820
 there was a point that my mom and dad would leave the house

36:00.540 --> 36:02.420
 and I would urinate in the floor.

36:03.780 --> 36:04.620
 All right.

36:04.620 --> 36:05.900
 And...

36:05.900 --> 36:09.300
 Is that like out of anger?

36:09.300 --> 36:11.300
 No, no idea why.

36:11.300 --> 36:12.140
 All right.

36:12.140 --> 36:12.980
 But I would.

36:12.980 --> 36:13.820
 Piss on the carpet.

36:13.820 --> 36:15.900
 Carpet pissers like the Lebowski, right?

36:18.260 --> 36:20.260
 It really tied the room together, dude.

36:20.260 --> 36:22.100
 It really tied the room together.

36:22.100 --> 36:22.940
 I was talking about that

36:22.940 --> 36:26.700
 and this lady comes up to me after the presentation

36:26.700 --> 36:29.500
 and she had a career previous to that

36:29.500 --> 36:31.860
 where she dealt with abused kids.

36:31.860 --> 36:32.780
 And she told me, she was like,

36:32.780 --> 36:37.220
 Brett, she's like, it's a control mechanism.

36:37.220 --> 36:40.060
 The only control you had was that.

36:40.060 --> 36:42.180
 And she's like, kids do that.

36:42.180 --> 36:43.500
 And I was like, so I'm not unique.

36:43.500 --> 36:45.660
 She's like, no, you're not unique in that.

36:45.660 --> 36:49.580
 So that, you know, this whole history of abuse,

36:49.580 --> 36:51.780
 Denise dealt with it by drinking,

36:51.780 --> 36:55.100
 by trying to commit suicide, things like that.

36:55.100 --> 36:56.340
 And then finally she escapes.

36:56.340 --> 36:57.180
 I'm the kid that didn't.

36:57.180 --> 37:00.540
 And not only that, my wife pointed out to me that,

37:00.540 --> 37:02.780
 again, it's that Eastern Kentucky mentality stuff.

37:02.780 --> 37:04.780
 You know, the male's expected to do things.

37:04.780 --> 37:08.660
 So with me, it was almost like I stepped up

37:09.660 --> 37:12.180
 to take part in those crimes

37:12.180 --> 37:14.580
 so that Denise didn't have to.

37:14.580 --> 37:16.580
 And she was able to avoid all that.

37:16.580 --> 37:18.140
 Other than that one shoplifting stuff,

37:18.140 --> 37:19.940
 Denise doesn't break the law anymore.

37:19.940 --> 37:22.820
 She goes off to be a, she's a good parent.

37:22.820 --> 37:24.140
 She's an angry parent.

37:24.140 --> 37:24.980
 She's a good parent.

37:24.980 --> 37:27.700
 She's a teacher, a good citizen overall.

37:27.700 --> 37:30.940
 I was just the guy that kept right on going with it.

37:30.940 --> 37:31.780
 Kept on going.

37:31.780 --> 37:32.980
 So let me ask you about that.

37:32.980 --> 37:37.300
 So your life of cyber crime.

37:37.300 --> 37:40.220
 In describing some of the things you did or knew about,

37:40.220 --> 37:41.700
 you said, quote,

37:41.700 --> 37:44.580
 "'I once stole several thousand dollars worth of coins

37:44.580 --> 37:47.140
 "'from a family trying to sell them

37:47.140 --> 37:48.820
 "'to put a new roof on their home.

37:48.820 --> 37:52.900
 "'Another time, I sent a counterfeit cashier's check

37:52.900 --> 37:55.980
 "'to a victim and he ended up being arrested for it.

37:55.980 --> 37:58.580
 "'I lied to family, friends, everyone I knew.

37:58.580 --> 38:01.100
 "'I was a truly despicable person.'"

38:01.100 --> 38:02.340
 True.

38:02.340 --> 38:05.100
 "'One of my Ukrainian associates script

38:05.100 --> 38:08.660
 "'had someone who owed him money kidnapped and tortured.

38:08.660 --> 38:11.320
 "'He posted pictures of it online.

38:11.320 --> 38:13.600
 "'Another member, Iceman,

38:13.600 --> 38:16.200
 "'used to flood his enemy's email addresses

38:16.200 --> 38:19.740
 "'with child pornography, then called the police on them.'"

38:19.740 --> 38:20.820
 That's some stories.

38:20.820 --> 38:23.900
 Can you tell some of these stories that stand out to you

38:23.900 --> 38:28.900
 that are particularly despicable or representative

38:29.180 --> 38:31.580
 or interesting when you look back

38:31.580 --> 38:36.260
 that defined your approach and who you were at that time?

38:36.260 --> 38:41.260
 Let me say that I did not care about my victim, all right?

38:41.940 --> 38:44.980
 I cared about me, is what I cared about.

38:45.940 --> 38:47.900
 It's rough to admit that.

38:50.140 --> 38:51.780
 You don't give a shit what you're doing to anybody else,

38:51.780 --> 38:52.820
 you only care about you.

38:52.820 --> 38:54.280
 But that's the truth of the matter.

38:54.280 --> 38:56.480
 I didn't care about the victims.

38:56.480 --> 39:00.740
 The lady, that wasn't even at the beginning of my career

39:00.740 --> 39:03.060
 as a cyber criminal, that was right at the last of it.

39:03.060 --> 39:03.900
 Which lady?

39:03.900 --> 39:04.980
 The coin lady.

39:05.900 --> 39:07.500
 By that point, Shadow Crew had made

39:07.500 --> 39:10.580
 the front cover of Forbes, August of 04.

39:10.580 --> 39:13.860
 October 26th of 04, Secret Service had shut us down,

39:13.860 --> 39:16.900
 33 people arrested, six countries in six hours.

39:16.900 --> 39:19.740
 I was the guy that was publicly mentioned as getting away.

39:20.620 --> 39:23.580
 What happened was is I was the guy who was,

39:23.580 --> 39:25.700
 I had kind of invented this crime

39:25.700 --> 39:27.860
 called tax return identity theft

39:27.860 --> 39:30.980
 and was stealing a lot of money.

39:30.980 --> 39:33.660
 I went through all my stateside savings

39:33.660 --> 39:35.540
 and Shadow Crew gets shut down.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.820
 I don't have any way to come in with any money,

39:37.820 --> 39:40.940
 so I start running counterfeit cashier's checks,

39:40.940 --> 39:42.380
 defrauding people with that,

39:42.380 --> 39:45.840
 having them send products or bullion collections,

39:45.840 --> 39:48.260
 what have you, by COD, collect on delivery,

39:48.260 --> 39:49.300
 and I would pay with it

39:49.300 --> 39:51.100
 with a counterfeit cashier's check.

39:51.100 --> 39:54.060
 This lady was on eBay.

39:54.060 --> 39:57.180
 She had been collecting these silver coins all of her life.

39:57.180 --> 39:58.700
 You know, the U.S. currency used to be,

39:58.700 --> 40:00.420
 the coins used to be silver,

40:00.420 --> 40:02.620
 so she had a whole collection of these things,

40:02.620 --> 40:05.580
 like, I don't know, 80, 90 pounds of this stuff,

40:05.580 --> 40:09.180
 and I'm a very good social engineer.

40:10.420 --> 40:13.780
 So, convinced her that I was a legitimate person,

40:13.780 --> 40:16.060
 that, you know, hey, send it to COD,

40:16.060 --> 40:18.700
 you can use my FedEx account to do that

40:18.700 --> 40:20.580
 or my UPS account to do that.

40:20.580 --> 40:23.460
 I'll pay with a cashier's check,

40:23.460 --> 40:25.740
 you can take it in, same as cash.

40:25.740 --> 40:28.740
 She believed that, she was, even on the ad,

40:28.740 --> 40:30.460
 and we talked on the phone and everything else,

40:30.460 --> 40:33.340
 she had told me that she was a single parent,

40:33.340 --> 40:34.940
 and it was the only money that she had

40:34.940 --> 40:39.460
 to put a roof on the house for her and her kids,

40:39.460 --> 40:41.460
 and I didn't give a damn.

40:41.460 --> 40:42.300
 I didn't give a damn.

40:42.300 --> 40:44.420
 What was more important was me at that point.

40:44.420 --> 40:46.380
 Can I ask you a question about the social engineering aspect?

40:46.380 --> 40:50.820
 So maybe specifics like the methodology,

40:50.820 --> 40:52.900
 email, you said phone,

40:52.900 --> 40:57.900
 maybe you could discuss this process

40:57.980 --> 41:00.300
 from a bigger philosophical perspective

41:00.300 --> 41:03.540
 of what is it about human beings

41:03.540 --> 41:06.580
 that makes it possible to be social engineer,

41:06.580 --> 41:09.780
 to be victims of fraud?

41:09.780 --> 41:14.780
 So, first let me say that I became a social engineer

41:15.020 --> 41:20.020
 as a child, all right, because the adults in my environment,

41:20.020 --> 41:23.300
 as a child, I had to know exactly what they were thinking

41:23.300 --> 41:26.340
 and be able to try to manipulate that for survival.

41:26.340 --> 41:30.740
 So I became a social engineer for survival initially,

41:30.740 --> 41:32.500
 all right, and one of the things that I've seen

41:32.500 --> 41:35.100
 with a lot of cyber criminals is the exact same thing.

41:35.100 --> 41:37.300
 They're really expert ones.

41:37.300 --> 41:38.980
 They become a social engineer as a child,

41:38.980 --> 41:42.940
 then later on, they use those tools to victimize others.

41:42.940 --> 41:44.740
 Which is fascinating because you're,

41:44.740 --> 41:46.780
 in order to understand what others are thinking,

41:46.780 --> 41:49.020
 you have to be extremely good at empathy.

41:49.020 --> 41:51.500
 So you have to like really put yourself

41:51.500 --> 41:53.300
 in the shoes of the other person.

41:53.300 --> 41:56.540
 And yet, in order to do cyber crime,

41:56.540 --> 42:00.740
 you have to not care about the pain

42:00.740 --> 42:03.100
 that might cause them once you manipulate them.

42:03.100 --> 42:06.860
 So you have to empathize and yet not care.

42:06.860 --> 42:08.420
 Exactly, and I would argue,

42:08.420 --> 42:11.260
 I would argue that that is not a sociopath

42:11.260 --> 42:13.500
 because a cyber criminal, and I was no different,

42:13.500 --> 42:15.860
 most cyber criminals justify those actions.

42:15.860 --> 42:18.540
 So the justification becomes what's important.

42:18.540 --> 42:21.380
 With me, the justification was why I did it for my family,

42:21.380 --> 42:24.060
 did it for my wife, did it for my stripper girlfriend.

42:24.060 --> 42:25.380
 So, and I believe those justifications.

42:25.380 --> 42:26.220
 That's a good story, I heard that one.

42:26.220 --> 42:27.060
 Yeah, so.

42:27.060 --> 42:28.660
 I like that, because I care about love a lot.

42:28.660 --> 42:33.660
 Yeah, so the big picture of that is trust.

42:35.220 --> 42:40.220
 How do you establish trust with a potential victim?

42:40.220 --> 42:42.540
 All right, now I would argue online

42:42.540 --> 42:44.860
 that that trust is established through a combination

42:44.860 --> 42:47.780
 of technology, tools, social engineering.

42:47.780 --> 42:50.580
 All right, so we trust our tech.

42:50.580 --> 42:53.340
 We trust our cell phones, we trust our laptops.

42:53.340 --> 42:55.020
 A lot of times we don't understand how they operate,

42:55.020 --> 42:56.980
 but we trust the news that comes across the line.

42:56.980 --> 42:59.420
 We trust the phone numbers that show up.

42:59.420 --> 43:02.340
 We trust IP addresses if we're advanced enough

43:02.340 --> 43:04.060
 to look at an IP address or a domain

43:04.060 --> 43:05.460
 or anything else like that.

43:05.460 --> 43:07.580
 Criminals use tools to manipulate that,

43:07.580 --> 43:10.220
 spoof phone numbers, spoof browser fingerprints,

43:11.500 --> 43:14.060
 whatever that may be, whatever the tool may be.

43:14.060 --> 43:16.540
 Then that lays a base level of trust.

43:16.540 --> 43:19.820
 At that point, you shoot in with the social engineering

43:19.820 --> 43:22.420
 and lay whatever story that is in order to manipulate

43:22.420 --> 43:25.060
 that victim to act not out of reason,

43:25.060 --> 43:27.740
 but out of emotion all of a sudden.

43:27.740 --> 43:30.380
 This is fascinating about the way humans interact

43:31.540 --> 43:34.620
 with the world, which is you're almost too afraid

43:34.620 --> 43:35.460
 to not trust the world.

43:35.460 --> 43:36.420
 You have to find a balance.

43:36.420 --> 43:40.380
 You have a lot of conspiracy theories now

43:40.380 --> 43:42.620
 about distrusting institutions and thinking

43:42.620 --> 43:44.060
 like everything around us.

43:44.060 --> 43:46.300
 It's like I've been listening to people

43:46.300 --> 43:48.300
 who believe the earth is flat.

43:48.300 --> 43:52.020
 And that conspiracy theory is fascinating to me

43:52.020 --> 43:57.020
 because it basically says that you can't trust anybody.

43:57.740 --> 44:00.460
 Like everything you hear is a lie.

44:00.460 --> 44:03.300
 So that's one, you can live that life

44:03.300 --> 44:04.340
 or you can live a life

44:04.340 --> 44:06.820
 where you're just naively trusting everything.

44:06.820 --> 44:08.220
 And we as humans have to,

44:08.220 --> 44:11.660
 because that life is kind of full of happiness

44:11.660 --> 44:13.260
 if nobody screws you over.

44:13.260 --> 44:16.620
 Cause you meet people with the joyful heart

44:16.620 --> 44:18.780
 and you get excited and all that kind of stuff.

44:18.780 --> 44:21.980
 But if you do that too much, you're gonna get burned.

44:21.980 --> 44:23.780
 So you have to find some kind of balance

44:23.780 --> 44:28.740
 in terms of optimizing happiness where you trust,

44:28.740 --> 44:32.020
 I mean, but verify and on the internet

44:32.020 --> 44:34.300
 that becomes really tricky.

44:34.300 --> 44:36.020
 You're almost too afraid to distrust everything

44:36.020 --> 44:38.820
 cause you'll never get anything done on the internet.

44:38.820 --> 44:41.220
 But then if you trust too much, you can get screwed over.

44:41.220 --> 44:45.100
 And so the social engineering comes in where you're like,

44:45.100 --> 44:47.620
 I'm not sure if I should trust this.

44:47.620 --> 44:50.620
 You kind of help them build the narrative

44:50.620 --> 44:51.620
 where it's like, it's good.

44:51.620 --> 44:52.460
 It's good.

44:52.460 --> 44:53.300
 It's good.

44:53.300 --> 44:55.660
 So in a lot of the times that social engineering

44:55.660 --> 45:00.660
 is just feeding into what the victim wants to believe.

45:00.740 --> 45:01.580
 All right.

45:01.580 --> 45:03.620
 It's not really coming up with a brand new story at all.

45:03.620 --> 45:05.380
 It's just knowing what that victim is,

45:05.380 --> 45:07.420
 what the motivations of that victim is

45:07.420 --> 45:08.940
 feeding into it at that point.

45:08.940 --> 45:10.220
 So you have to, again,

45:10.220 --> 45:14.060
 that social engineer has to almost immediately know

45:14.060 --> 45:16.300
 what's driving that person that they're talking about.

45:16.300 --> 45:18.060
 If I'm working on a phone,

45:18.060 --> 45:19.380
 talking to someone over the phone,

45:19.380 --> 45:22.300
 I have to know within seconds what I need to say,

45:22.300 --> 45:23.820
 how I need to act to interact

45:23.820 --> 45:25.820
 with that customer service agent

45:25.820 --> 45:28.100
 or whoever I'm talking to on the other end of the line.

45:28.100 --> 45:31.220
 So fascinating because you truly are empathizing

45:31.220 --> 45:32.220
 with the other person.

45:32.220 --> 45:33.300
 Absolutely.

45:33.300 --> 45:34.140
 Who is it?

45:34.140 --> 45:36.580
 This business man, Steven Schwarzman.

45:36.580 --> 45:40.380
 And I've talked to a few times.

45:40.380 --> 45:42.100
 He mentioned this thing that,

45:44.020 --> 45:45.780
 the way you build deep relationships

45:45.780 --> 45:49.020
 is you really kind of notice

45:49.020 --> 45:51.220
 the things that people are telling you.

45:51.220 --> 45:56.140
 Like what they want and what they're bothered by,

45:56.140 --> 45:58.300
 what are their big problems in their lives?

45:58.300 --> 46:00.900
 Because everybody's saying that all the time

46:00.900 --> 46:02.540
 and most of us are just ignoring it.

46:02.540 --> 46:03.380
 Right.

46:03.380 --> 46:05.420
 But if you take the time to listen,

46:05.420 --> 46:07.060
 you know somebody at that point.

46:07.060 --> 46:07.900
 Yeah.

46:07.900 --> 46:08.740
 Absolutely you do.

46:08.740 --> 46:10.820
 Then you have to be able to dismiss it.

46:10.820 --> 46:12.780
 You have to dismiss it after.

46:12.780 --> 46:14.020
 You're looking for that just to see

46:14.020 --> 46:17.020
 how I can manipulate that is what you're trying to do.

46:17.020 --> 46:20.340
 So the lady was one story,

46:20.340 --> 46:22.020
 another truly despicable story.

46:22.020 --> 46:23.900
 We'll get to script in a second.

46:23.900 --> 46:25.700
 But another truly despicable story.

46:25.700 --> 46:28.900
 We were one of the really first groups

46:28.900 --> 46:30.700
 that started phishing attacks.

46:30.700 --> 46:31.540
 What's phishing?

46:31.540 --> 46:33.580
 So that is a social engineering attack.

46:33.580 --> 46:34.580
 PH by the way.

46:34.580 --> 46:35.420
 Yeah, PH.

46:35.420 --> 46:36.780
 That's another social engineering attack.

46:36.780 --> 46:38.900
 That's sending that fake email out

46:38.900 --> 46:40.580
 that looks like it's coming from a website

46:40.580 --> 46:42.380
 or your financial organization or whatever

46:42.380 --> 46:44.340
 and saying, hey, we've got a security problem.

46:44.340 --> 46:46.980
 We need you to update your account information.

46:46.980 --> 46:50.540
 Well, back then no one had ever seen a phishing attack.

46:50.540 --> 46:53.280
 So you could ask for all the information.

46:53.280 --> 46:56.240
 You were getting just complete identity profiles

46:56.240 --> 46:57.380
 on a phishing email.

46:57.380 --> 46:58.340
 Nowadays you can't do that.

46:58.340 --> 47:00.160
 Nowadays you look for basically credentials

47:00.160 --> 47:02.020
 because everyone is aware of phishing.

47:02.020 --> 47:03.860
 But back then it was complete information.

47:03.860 --> 47:08.420
 We had phished out, I don't know, 200,000 eTrade accounts.

47:08.420 --> 47:10.060
 That's what we had the login credentials for.

47:10.060 --> 47:11.180
 The login password, yeah.

47:11.180 --> 47:13.900
 Login password, complete social, date of birth,

47:13.900 --> 47:17.740
 mother's maiden account information, everything else.

47:17.740 --> 47:20.380
 So we had access to those eTrade accounts.

47:20.380 --> 47:24.180
 eTrade initially had no security in place.

47:24.180 --> 47:26.180
 So you could cash out the account,

47:26.180 --> 47:29.940
 ACH the money out to whatever account you wanted to,

47:29.940 --> 47:31.540
 went through just fine.

47:31.540 --> 47:34.900
 Made them alive on that for four to six months.

47:34.900 --> 47:38.380
 eTrade got to the point where you couldn't

47:38.380 --> 47:41.260
 do any ACH coming out.

47:41.260 --> 47:42.780
 They locked everything down.

47:42.780 --> 47:46.380
 Well, you're still sitting on thousands of eTrade accounts.

47:46.380 --> 47:47.660
 How do you make money on that?

47:50.540 --> 47:51.580
 That's a good question.

47:51.580 --> 47:53.580
 So what you do is you find some fat cat that's

47:53.580 --> 47:57.220
 got his retirement invested in blue chips.

47:57.220 --> 47:59.420
 Same time you find a penny stock,

47:59.420 --> 48:03.060
 you open up a brand new account, buy into that penny stock,

48:03.060 --> 48:06.460
 cash the fat cat out, buy into that same penny stock,

48:06.460 --> 48:08.140
 bump and dump schemes all of a sudden.

48:08.140 --> 48:11.020
 So you're destroying people's retirement accounts

48:11.020 --> 48:12.940
 for just a few thousand dollars.

48:12.940 --> 48:14.020
 Bam, bam, bam.

48:14.020 --> 48:17.620
 And of course, eTrade's response is, not our problem.

48:17.620 --> 48:18.500
 It's your problem.

48:18.500 --> 48:19.900
 You shouldn't give up your password

48:19.900 --> 48:21.500
 or what have you at that point.

48:21.500 --> 48:24.020
 And you still see that issue today with Zelle scams

48:24.020 --> 48:25.380
 and things like that.

48:25.380 --> 48:26.300
 Which scam?

48:26.300 --> 48:26.940
 Zelle.

48:26.940 --> 48:28.620
 So you know, the instant payment that they have.

48:28.620 --> 48:29.900
 So it's the same kind of operation,

48:29.900 --> 48:32.300
 same type of difference with different payment mechanisms.

48:32.300 --> 48:35.460
 You find an easy way to exploit a system,

48:35.460 --> 48:39.100
 and typically the financial organization, not our problem.

48:39.100 --> 48:41.780
 Our system's secure, it's the humans, it's their errors.

48:41.780 --> 48:43.780
 Well, not really.

48:43.780 --> 48:45.940
 You know, you've got some culpability in that,

48:45.940 --> 48:49.380
 and you're just trying to avoid paying the part of the bill

48:49.380 --> 48:50.220
 is what's going on.

48:50.220 --> 48:52.500
 One of the things, just to stand fishing for a bit,

48:52.500 --> 48:57.420
 is it really makes me sad because there's been people

48:57.420 --> 49:00.660
 on all kinds of platforms, including YouTube comments,

49:00.660 --> 49:02.220
 but emails too.

49:02.220 --> 49:04.660
 They figured out emails somehow.

49:04.660 --> 49:11.620
 So people are now seeing the followers

49:11.620 --> 49:13.940
 of this particular podcast who are fans,

49:13.940 --> 49:18.060
 they're finding them on platforms like LinkedIn and YouTube

49:18.060 --> 49:20.820
 and so on, and they are figuring out

49:20.820 --> 49:24.980
 ways to get to those people by another channel, which

49:24.980 --> 49:29.620
 I suppose seems more authentic to those people.

49:29.620 --> 49:34.700
 So they send them an email from what looks like me,

49:34.700 --> 49:37.980
 and with this kind of loving message.

49:37.980 --> 49:39.780
 The interesting thing, the emails

49:39.780 --> 49:41.900
 sound like something I would write.

49:41.900 --> 49:44.580
 So these aren't even, at this stage, it's not even,

49:44.580 --> 49:46.180
 it doesn't feel automated.

49:46.180 --> 49:49.900
 Or if it's automated, there's a human in the loop

49:49.900 --> 49:52.540
 that's really fine tuning it to a specific,

49:52.540 --> 49:53.980
 or maybe I'm very predictable.

49:53.980 --> 49:58.340
 But it's very loving in the way I would write that message.

49:58.340 --> 49:59.900
 So think about that, all right?

49:59.900 --> 50:02.100
 So when Phishing first comes out,

50:02.100 --> 50:04.740
 you could look at the language of the text or the website

50:04.740 --> 50:07.940
 and say, eh, if you were paying attention, that's so OK.

50:07.940 --> 50:11.340
 So that's not an English speaker who wrote that, typically.

50:11.340 --> 50:15.060
 But as time has went on, as the awareness of what a Phishing

50:15.060 --> 50:17.500
 attack looks like, we have people

50:17.500 --> 50:19.380
 that are sitting down now and making sure

50:19.380 --> 50:20.740
 that the language is proper.

50:20.740 --> 50:22.060
 It gets worse than that, though.

50:22.060 --> 50:24.260
 If you look at business email compromise,

50:24.260 --> 50:26.820
 so the way a business email compromise typically works

50:26.820 --> 50:31.580
 is the attacker will find a payroll person, find a CEO.

50:31.580 --> 50:34.300
 He will fashion a spear phishing email, which

50:34.300 --> 50:36.700
 is that's a Phishing attack that's targeting

50:36.700 --> 50:38.980
 one specific individual.

50:38.980 --> 50:40.740
 So he'll fashion a spear phishing email.

50:40.740 --> 50:43.860
 And the way he does that is he pulls all the information

50:43.860 --> 50:49.180
 he possibly can on that person, that CEO.

50:49.180 --> 50:55.940
 Maybe he'll spear that CEO just to get their login credentials

50:55.940 --> 50:58.180
 to their email, just to read the emails.

50:58.180 --> 50:59.700
 And he'll go in there, and he'll start

50:59.700 --> 51:01.220
 reading all these emails.

51:01.220 --> 51:04.340
 He'll specifically read the emails to the payroll

51:04.340 --> 51:06.140
 department, see what that relationship is.

51:06.140 --> 51:07.580
 Are they talking about their kids,

51:07.580 --> 51:09.500
 talking about relationships, talking about vacation?

51:09.500 --> 51:10.500
 What are they talking about?

51:10.500 --> 51:11.340
 How are they talking?

51:11.340 --> 51:12.300
 Are they friendly?

51:12.300 --> 51:13.300
 Are they sterile?

51:13.300 --> 51:15.060
 What are they doing, all right?

51:15.060 --> 51:17.060
 So then he decides, well, I'm going to go ahead

51:17.060 --> 51:20.020
 and spear phish the payroll department as well.

51:20.020 --> 51:22.540
 So then he spear phishes in, gets those credentials.

51:22.540 --> 51:25.700
 At the same time, he creates a Unicode domain

51:25.700 --> 51:27.740
 in whatever the company name is, all right?

51:27.740 --> 51:29.780
 So instead of that English alphabet I,

51:29.780 --> 51:32.220
 he's got that Russian letter that looks like an I

51:32.220 --> 51:35.260
 but without the dot on top, all right?

51:35.260 --> 51:38.340
 Comes back into the email, into the payroll email,

51:38.340 --> 51:42.780
 blocks the real CEO's email, replaces that with the Unicode

51:42.780 --> 51:47.620
 email that he's got, and then sends out a message

51:47.620 --> 51:50.340
 using the correct language, the correct relationships,

51:50.340 --> 51:52.700
 everything else, and says, hey, we're updating

51:52.700 --> 51:55.140
 our account status, I need you to send this payment

51:55.140 --> 51:58.100
 instead of over here, they've set up a new account,

51:58.100 --> 51:59.860
 send all payments over here now.

51:59.860 --> 52:02.620
 And that is business email compromise in a nutshell,

52:02.620 --> 52:04.460
 all right, works great.

52:04.460 --> 52:06.580
 Probably the larger the organization,

52:06.580 --> 52:10.140
 the more susceptible to that kind of attack

52:10.140 --> 52:14.820
 because there's like a distribution of responsibility

52:14.820 --> 52:16.900
 to where you're more likely to believe that,

52:16.900 --> 52:18.980
 okay, this other person is responsible,

52:18.980 --> 52:21.420
 I'm sure they secured everything.

52:21.420 --> 52:23.180
 I'm okay listening to this.

52:24.260 --> 52:25.940
 So that's business email compromise,

52:25.940 --> 52:27.780
 and those crimes, and that's one of the things

52:27.780 --> 52:28.820
 you see about cybercrime.

52:28.820 --> 52:30.820
 Cybercrime's not really sophisticated.

52:30.820 --> 52:32.900
 It's not, the attacks are not sophisticated.

52:32.900 --> 52:37.900
 The stat is 90% of every single attack uses a known exploit.

52:37.900 --> 52:41.380
 It's not zero day attacks, they're out there,

52:41.380 --> 52:43.620
 but if you're a criminal waiting on a zero day to profit,

52:43.620 --> 52:45.420
 you're gonna starve to death.

52:45.420 --> 52:50.420
 The meat and potatoes are that 90%, known exploits.

52:50.460 --> 52:54.020
 And then the rest is, well, you're saying it's,

52:54.020 --> 52:56.820
 maybe you mean it's not technically sophisticated,

52:56.820 --> 52:59.060
 but it's social engineering sophisticated.

52:59.060 --> 53:01.340
 Very sophisticated on that end, very sophisticated.

53:01.340 --> 53:03.380
 I mean, it's a fascinating study of that.

53:03.380 --> 53:06.780
 That establishment of trust and then using that trust

53:06.780 --> 53:09.460
 to defraud that victim.

53:09.460 --> 53:11.300
 That is something.

53:11.300 --> 53:14.380
 I wish, obviously, all of these folks

53:14.380 --> 53:16.740
 are really good at hiding.

53:16.740 --> 53:19.460
 I wish you could tell their stories in a way,

53:19.460 --> 53:21.020
 which is why you're fascinating,

53:21.020 --> 53:22.820
 is you're able to tell these stories now,

53:22.820 --> 53:27.820
 because it is studying human nature by exploiting it,

53:28.180 --> 53:30.260
 but you get to understand our weak points,

53:30.260 --> 53:35.060
 our hope, our desire to trust others.

53:35.060 --> 53:40.060
 Also, the weak points and the failures of digital systems

53:42.900 --> 53:46.020
 and at scale, humans have to connect.

53:46.020 --> 53:46.860
 It's fascinating.

53:46.860 --> 53:50.920
 This is a weird question, asking for a friend.

53:52.700 --> 53:54.860
 Is spear phishing itself illegal?

53:54.860 --> 53:56.260
 What's the legality here?

53:56.260 --> 53:57.140
 Oh, it's all illegal.

53:57.140 --> 53:58.220
 Absolutely it is.

53:58.220 --> 53:59.060
 Is it?

53:59.060 --> 53:59.900
 Absolutely.

53:59.900 --> 54:02.460
 So here's what, okay, let me construct an example.

54:02.460 --> 54:07.460
 So if my friend were to spear phish like a CEO, right,

54:10.620 --> 54:14.560
 and get their information and after they get control,

54:14.560 --> 54:16.220
 say, of their Twitter account,

54:16.220 --> 54:21.220
 they tweet something loving and positive, what's the crime?

54:21.900 --> 54:23.700
 Unauthorized access of advice.

54:23.700 --> 54:27.580
 What will be the punishment, do you think?

54:27.580 --> 54:29.100
 That becomes questionable.

54:29.100 --> 54:33.020
 So no monetary loss, or was there a monetary loss?

54:33.020 --> 54:34.740
 Probably not, all right?

54:34.740 --> 54:37.140
 So you have to figure out who the victim is

54:37.140 --> 54:38.200
 before charges are pressed.

54:38.200 --> 54:42.140
 Now, the crime would be unauthorized access, all right?

54:42.140 --> 54:45.300
 But no real victim on that,

54:45.300 --> 54:48.260
 unless the person whose account you took over

54:48.260 --> 54:50.820
 takes exception to that.

54:51.860 --> 54:53.060
 No monetary loss.

54:53.060 --> 54:55.140
 So there's not really standard fines.

54:55.140 --> 54:56.880
 Probably nothing's gonna happen, right.

54:56.880 --> 54:57.720
 Right, right.

54:57.720 --> 54:59.900
 So, I mean, that's kind of interesting,

54:59.900 --> 55:04.280
 because it's, so when I got the ransomware,

55:04.280 --> 55:07.720
 when I got the zero day attack on the QNAP mass,

55:09.920 --> 55:14.920
 they basically say the criminal is QNAP, the company,

55:17.580 --> 55:20.720
 for having so many security vulnerabilities.

55:20.720 --> 55:25.720
 They're like, you are the victim of QNAP's incompetence.

55:25.720 --> 55:27.880
 That's the way they kind of phrase it.

55:27.880 --> 55:30.080
 And see, I don't agree with that.

55:30.080 --> 55:31.920
 I don't agree with that at all.

55:31.920 --> 55:33.760
 So, SolarWinds.

55:33.760 --> 55:34.600
 Yeah.

55:34.600 --> 55:39.600
 Let's, so I've got 130 page class action lawsuit

55:41.200 --> 55:43.120
 printed out at the house, I've been going through it,

55:43.120 --> 55:47.200
 that catalogs how SolarWinds lied for years

55:47.200 --> 55:49.760
 about their vulnerabilities, and they lied to investors.

55:49.760 --> 55:53.720
 The people who came in, the honorees who they would hire,

55:53.720 --> 55:57.040
 would, you know, they would not pay attention to them

55:57.040 --> 55:58.600
 when they said, you know, you've got these issues,

55:58.600 --> 56:01.560
 they would say, go away, shit like that for years,

56:01.560 --> 56:04.880
 until SolarWinds, you know, the attacks become apparent.

56:07.160 --> 56:10.960
 My view on that is that the only person

56:10.960 --> 56:14.040
 responsible for the crime are the criminals

56:14.040 --> 56:18.000
 who did the attacking, the actual criminals, not SolarWinds.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.400
 Now, does that mean that SolarWinds isn't all fucked up?

56:21.400 --> 56:25.560
 They are, and there needs to be some accounting in place.

56:25.560 --> 56:29.400
 But the only individual, the only people responsible

56:29.400 --> 56:33.680
 for crime are the criminals, and that's either online,

56:33.680 --> 56:36.520
 in the physical world, what have you.

56:36.520 --> 56:39.800
 Being an idiot is not a crime.

56:39.800 --> 56:40.640
 Not a crime.

56:40.640 --> 56:45.200
 You know, being criminally negligent is,

56:45.200 --> 56:48.640
 and I think that SolarWinds is certainly responsible,

56:48.640 --> 56:52.240
 not responsible, they're culpable for what happened.

56:52.240 --> 56:55.360
 Can you actually tell folks about SolarWinds?

56:55.360 --> 56:59.600
 What is it, what are some interesting things

56:59.600 --> 57:00.440
 that you're aware of?

57:00.440 --> 57:05.440
 SolarWinds was very, it provided a backbone of security

57:05.760 --> 57:10.760
 for hundreds, thousands of different companies.

57:12.360 --> 57:14.440
 If you looked at, a lot of security companies

57:14.440 --> 57:16.360
 were using SolarWinds that would allow you

57:16.360 --> 57:19.040
 to get a snapshot of the entire system

57:19.040 --> 57:20.400
 that they were working on.

57:20.400 --> 57:24.400
 So what happens is, is you get a Russian group that comes in

57:24.400 --> 57:29.400
 and they basically, they hack into SolarWinds

57:29.560 --> 57:31.680
 and get access to it, and it allows them

57:31.680 --> 57:36.680
 to view every single thing, I mean, every single thing

57:37.240 --> 57:42.240
 about every single client that SolarWinds had at that point.

57:42.240 --> 57:46.000
 So entire snapshots of all the IP that was going on,

57:46.000 --> 57:47.920
 all the emails, all the communications,

57:47.920 --> 57:50.920
 every single secret that was going on with those companies.

57:50.920 --> 57:53.640
 If a company had software like Microsoft,

57:53.640 --> 57:55.720
 it allowed them to look at the source code

57:55.720 --> 57:57.240
 of everything that was going on.

57:57.240 --> 58:01.080
 I mean, it's just a complete and total nightmare, all right?

58:01.080 --> 58:05.960
 And something that you are not going to recover from.

58:05.960 --> 58:07.280
 You're not.

58:07.280 --> 58:08.960
 I mean, it's done at that point.

58:08.960 --> 58:12.480
 You know, there's not been a lot of news lately about it,

58:12.480 --> 58:15.120
 but the fact of the matter is, is that's the type of attack

58:15.120 --> 58:16.920
 that's a catastrophic attack.

58:16.920 --> 58:19.840
 So there's a huge amount of information

58:19.840 --> 58:22.720
 that was read, saved elsewhere probably.

58:22.720 --> 58:23.560
 Oh yeah.

58:23.560 --> 58:26.280
 And so now there's people sitting on information.

58:26.280 --> 58:27.120
 Absolutely.

58:27.120 --> 58:28.600
 So think about one of the attack vectors

58:28.600 --> 58:32.800
 has been Microsoft Outlook 365, things like that.

58:32.800 --> 58:34.320
 This allowed the attackers to look

58:34.320 --> 58:36.400
 at the source codes of that.

58:36.400 --> 58:39.240
 So they have the source code now,

58:39.240 --> 58:41.520
 so they go through it line by line.

58:41.520 --> 58:42.560
 Where are the vulnerabilities?

58:42.560 --> 58:44.600
 Let's find new vulnerabilities, new zero days.

58:44.600 --> 58:46.520
 You know, I said zero days aren't common,

58:46.520 --> 58:49.000
 but this opens up an entire new threat surface

58:49.000 --> 58:50.000
 all of a sudden.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.480
 So it's a completely catastrophic attack.

58:52.480 --> 58:54.800
 Once all the chips are down, everything's tallied up,

58:54.800 --> 58:56.760
 people are going to be like, yeah, we're done.

58:56.760 --> 58:57.600
 We're done.

58:57.600 --> 58:58.440
 Yeah.

58:58.440 --> 59:02.800
 All right, this whole computer thing,

59:02.800 --> 59:04.840
 we tried it and we're walking away.

59:04.840 --> 59:05.680
 We're done.

59:05.680 --> 59:07.560
 That's terrifying.

59:07.560 --> 59:11.680
 So you're saying that there's not been obvious

59:11.680 --> 59:14.720
 big negative impact from that yet.

59:14.720 --> 59:15.560
 So, but like.

59:15.560 --> 59:16.920
 There's been a lot of negative impact,

59:16.920 --> 59:18.320
 but we're just starting.

59:18.320 --> 59:19.160
 Right.

59:19.160 --> 59:22.520
 So the capacity for destruction is huge here.

59:22.520 --> 59:24.600
 How much involvement from nation states

59:24.600 --> 59:26.640
 do you think there is on this?

59:26.640 --> 59:28.000
 You know, it's interesting.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.680
 So you've got Iran, you've got North Korea,

59:31.680 --> 59:33.240
 China, Russia, you got the big four.

59:33.240 --> 59:35.440
 You also got Brazil.

59:35.440 --> 59:36.680
 You've got all these other countries

59:36.680 --> 59:39.080
 that are interested in the United States as well.

59:40.600 --> 59:42.120
 Nation states are interesting

59:42.120 --> 59:44.440
 depending on who the nation state is.

59:44.440 --> 59:46.240
 All right, so Russia is very good about working

59:46.240 --> 59:48.240
 with the type of criminal that I used to be.

59:48.240 --> 59:49.960
 You know, they'll enlist these guys

59:49.960 --> 59:51.880
 and steal information or what have you,

59:51.880 --> 59:54.080
 then Russia will take the information they want to,

59:54.080 --> 59:56.640
 and they'll basically go off and sell whatever you want to

59:56.640 --> 59:58.280
 and make some money.

59:58.280 --> 1:00:00.320
 China's all about IP.

1:00:01.160 --> 1:00:02.480
 North Korea is about stealing money

1:00:02.480 --> 1:00:03.320
 because they really don't know

1:00:03.320 --> 1:00:07.200
 what the hell else to do right now, but...

1:00:07.200 --> 1:00:09.480
 So North Korea is actively involved in cybercrime.

1:00:09.480 --> 1:00:10.360
 Absolutely.

1:00:10.360 --> 1:00:13.320
 They've stolen a shitload of Bitcoin, everything else.

1:00:13.320 --> 1:00:16.640
 So absolutely, they're actively involved with that.

1:00:16.640 --> 1:00:19.120
 Very, very skilled attackers, very skilled.

1:00:19.120 --> 1:00:20.160
 But even if you look at, you know,

1:00:20.160 --> 1:00:23.560
 I told you that stat about 90%, all right?

1:00:23.560 --> 1:00:25.920
 So even though SolarWinds is going to be

1:00:27.920 --> 1:00:29.320
 the number one attack,

1:00:29.320 --> 1:00:33.040
 the followup to that is this NotPetya attack that happened.

1:00:33.040 --> 1:00:35.680
 And so that was the most sophisticated attack

1:00:35.680 --> 1:00:38.200
 launched by the Russian Sandworm Group

1:00:38.200 --> 1:00:40.920
 using all known exploits throughout.

1:00:40.920 --> 1:00:42.960
 So it's not, again, it's not...

1:00:43.920 --> 1:00:45.320
 You're right in the sophistication

1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:47.880
 is typically not technical sophistication,

1:00:47.880 --> 1:00:50.120
 but it's a social engineering sophistication.

1:00:50.120 --> 1:00:52.200
 How do you get these things put together

1:00:52.200 --> 1:00:54.320
 in line to attack and succeed?

1:00:55.360 --> 1:00:57.320
 But when you get access to the source code,

1:00:57.320 --> 1:00:59.560
 that's where technical sophistication could really do

1:00:59.560 --> 1:01:00.400
 a lot of damage.

1:01:00.400 --> 1:01:02.760
 And that's when you find out real quick,

1:01:02.760 --> 1:01:05.440
 that's what separates the men from the boys in this game.

1:01:05.440 --> 1:01:07.160
 All right, because all of a sudden it's not,

1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:09.000
 I don't have to worry about social engineering.

1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:11.800
 I've got source codes and I've got professionals

1:01:11.800 --> 1:01:13.280
 that are looking at that.

1:01:13.280 --> 1:01:14.480
 And that's your ass.

1:01:15.520 --> 1:01:18.320
 Which then enables probably even more powerful

1:01:18.320 --> 1:01:20.200
 social engineering methods too.

1:01:20.200 --> 1:01:22.120
 I mean, it's just the cascade of...

1:01:24.560 --> 1:01:26.480
 Is this terrifying to you, by the way?

1:01:26.480 --> 1:01:29.760
 That this world that we're living in,

1:01:29.760 --> 1:01:34.760
 as we put more and more of ourselves on the internet,

1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:38.720
 into the metaverse, that there's so many more

1:01:38.720 --> 1:01:40.680
 attack vectors on our wellbeing?

1:01:40.680 --> 1:01:45.240
 What's terrifying to me, I used to preach it on Shadow Crew,

1:01:45.240 --> 1:01:49.640
 is the idea that the perception of truth

1:01:49.640 --> 1:01:52.320
 is more important than the truth itself.

1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:53.920
 It doesn't matter what the facts are,

1:01:53.920 --> 1:01:56.640
 it matters what I can convince you of.

1:01:56.640 --> 1:01:58.680
 That's what's terrifying to me.

1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:02.000
 So you look at deep fakes, you look at fake news,

1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:03.760
 all this stuff that's going out,

1:02:03.760 --> 1:02:06.000
 that becomes truly terrifying.

1:02:09.320 --> 1:02:11.960
 Maybe there's an angle where it's freeing,

1:02:11.960 --> 1:02:15.720
 if nothing is true and you can't trust anything.

1:02:15.720 --> 1:02:20.640
 But you see, we as human beings, we wanna trust.

1:02:20.640 --> 1:02:22.800
 We do, we need human interaction.

1:02:22.800 --> 1:02:24.920
 And for that human interaction,

1:02:24.920 --> 1:02:27.000
 you have to have a degree of trust.

1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:31.920
 But it's more like you let go of an idea of absolute truth

1:02:31.920 --> 1:02:35.720
 and it more becomes like a blockchain style consensus.

1:02:35.720 --> 1:02:38.360
 So you let go of like, you know what?

1:02:39.600 --> 1:02:42.760
 There's this human dream, you get this on the internet,

1:02:42.760 --> 1:02:47.080
 you get like facts, as if there's at the bottom,

1:02:47.080 --> 1:02:49.400
 at the bottom, there's one turtle that's holding

1:02:49.400 --> 1:02:54.040
 this scroll that says, these are the truths of the world.

1:02:54.040 --> 1:02:57.360
 The problem is, I mean, maybe believing

1:02:57.360 --> 1:02:59.040
 that is counterproductive.

1:02:59.040 --> 1:03:04.040
 Maybe human civilization is an ongoing process of consensus.

1:03:04.640 --> 1:03:08.320
 And so it's always going to be, everything is shrouded

1:03:08.320 --> 1:03:11.000
 and you can call them lies or you can call them inaccuracies

1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:13.720
 or you can call them delusions.

1:03:13.720 --> 1:03:16.680
 It's constantly going to be, it's going to be a sea of lies

1:03:16.680 --> 1:03:21.680
 and delusions, but our hope is to over time

1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:24.520
 develop bigger and bigger islands of consensus

1:03:24.520 --> 1:03:27.520
 that allows us to live a stable and happy society.

1:03:27.520 --> 1:03:32.520
 Don't call it true, call it a stable consensus

1:03:32.880 --> 1:03:34.880
 that creates a high quality of life

1:03:34.880 --> 1:03:36.800
 for the inhabitants of the island.

1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:38.400
 I like it, I mean, I like it.

1:03:38.400 --> 1:03:40.240
 I mean, we're going to agree on this.

1:03:40.240 --> 1:03:43.080
 And then don't use outlook, no, I'm just kidding.

1:03:43.080 --> 1:03:47.840
 So maybe a step back, you mentioned, I'd love to talk

1:03:47.840 --> 1:03:49.400
 about ShadowCrew, maybe this is the right time

1:03:49.400 --> 1:03:51.440
 to actually, yeah, let's go to ShadowCrew

1:03:51.440 --> 1:03:53.040
 because it's such a fascinating story.

1:03:53.040 --> 1:03:54.680
 So tell me the story of building ShadowCrew,

1:03:54.680 --> 1:03:59.800
 the precursor to today's darknet and darknet markets.

1:03:59.800 --> 1:04:02.960
 This is why you're the original Godfather.

1:04:02.960 --> 1:04:04.600
 This is it, this is it.

1:04:04.600 --> 1:04:06.640
 So I get married.

1:04:06.640 --> 1:04:09.120
 I faked a car accident to get married,

1:04:09.120 --> 1:04:10.160
 got the money from that.

1:04:10.160 --> 1:04:11.120
 You're romantic.

1:04:11.120 --> 1:04:13.320
 I remember, like my dad, man.

1:04:13.320 --> 1:04:15.000
 I'm the guy that, you know, I get from mom,

1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:16.720
 I get the criminal mindset.

1:04:16.720 --> 1:04:19.600
 From dad, I get that, don't want him to leave.

1:04:19.600 --> 1:04:22.480
 So, you know, so.

1:04:22.480 --> 1:04:26.520
 To get married, what's that story?

1:04:26.520 --> 1:04:28.160
 Oh, dude, I was.

1:04:28.160 --> 1:04:29.680
 How did you fall in love there?

1:04:29.680 --> 1:04:32.120
 My first girlfriend was a preacher's daughter

1:04:32.120 --> 1:04:35.280
 and crazy over her, dated her for five years.

1:04:35.280 --> 1:04:38.680
 And she figured out pretty quickly that,

1:04:38.680 --> 1:04:40.360
 well, not quickly, it took her five years

1:04:40.360 --> 1:04:44.760
 to figure out that Brett Johnson is not the man of God.

1:04:44.760 --> 1:04:50.600
 I could talk it, but more that agnostic than anything,

1:04:50.600 --> 1:04:52.320
 she breaks up with me.

1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:54.880
 So I was at the community college.

1:04:54.880 --> 1:04:56.840
 You'd make one hell of a preacher by the way.

1:04:56.840 --> 1:04:57.360
 Thank you.

1:04:57.360 --> 1:04:59.680
 Let's put that.

1:04:59.680 --> 1:05:02.360
 Yeah.

1:05:02.360 --> 1:05:04.080
 I've got that Langston Hughes problem.

1:05:04.080 --> 1:05:08.920
 I'm looking for Jesus to show up and he just doesn't.

1:05:08.920 --> 1:05:10.520
 So I was at the community college

1:05:10.520 --> 1:05:12.040
 and I was a straight asshole.

1:05:12.040 --> 1:05:14.480
 I was arrogant, conceited, everything else.

1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:17.520
 And I had posted an advertisement

1:05:17.520 --> 1:05:20.440
 on one of the billboards looking for an adult babysitter,

1:05:20.440 --> 1:05:24.040
 hot blonde, you know, come visit me in the library.

1:05:24.040 --> 1:05:26.240
 Buddy of mine shows up and he's like, Brett.

1:05:26.240 --> 1:05:27.520
 And I was like, yeah.

1:05:27.520 --> 1:05:29.920
 He's like, hottest girl in school, right down the hall.

1:05:29.920 --> 1:05:30.960
 And I was like, serious?

1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:31.680
 He's like, yeah.

1:05:31.680 --> 1:05:34.240
 And I was like, let's go see.

1:05:34.240 --> 1:05:37.360
 Walk over and there's these two guys that are hitting on her.

1:05:37.360 --> 1:05:40.840
 So I just walk up and me and Todd, that was my buddy,

1:05:40.840 --> 1:05:43.360
 walk up and I'm just sitting there and listening.

1:05:43.360 --> 1:05:45.280
 And they're giving the spill and everything.

1:05:45.280 --> 1:05:46.680
 And she's just kind of taking it in.

1:05:46.680 --> 1:05:48.880
 Finally, I looked over and I was like,

1:05:48.880 --> 1:05:50.560
 you want to get out of here?

1:05:50.560 --> 1:05:53.560
 And one of the guys looks at me and he's like, hey,

1:05:53.560 --> 1:05:54.080
 we're talking to you.

1:05:54.080 --> 1:05:55.840
 And I was like, well, you're talking at her.

1:05:55.840 --> 1:05:57.080
 You're not talking to her.

1:05:57.080 --> 1:05:59.320
 I'm about to save her ass from you.

1:05:59.320 --> 1:06:01.320
 Yeah, that's a smooth pick up line, by the way.

1:06:01.320 --> 1:06:02.720
 If I ever heard one, that's good.

1:06:02.720 --> 1:06:04.160
 You want to get out of here?

1:06:04.160 --> 1:06:08.520
 So start dating, and she was the girl

1:06:08.520 --> 1:06:10.960
 that screwed my brains out.

1:06:10.960 --> 1:06:13.120
 And I fell head over heels.

1:06:13.120 --> 1:06:15.120
 We got married six months later.

1:06:15.120 --> 1:06:16.000
 Six months.

1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:17.040
 That's what love does.

1:06:17.040 --> 1:06:18.240
 That's what it does.

1:06:18.240 --> 1:06:22.800
 And she didn't know I was a crook.

1:06:22.800 --> 1:06:24.480
 She had no idea.

1:06:24.480 --> 1:06:26.240
 She knew I was very bright.

1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:30.480
 She knew I did a lot of theater, stuff like that.

1:06:30.480 --> 1:06:32.760
 Got a job at, I was in hazard.

1:06:32.760 --> 1:06:35.760
 There was no jobs to be had, so I got a job in Lexington,

1:06:35.760 --> 1:06:38.480
 because we were going to be moving to the UK.

1:06:38.480 --> 1:06:43.240
 Got a job in Lexington at Lexmark testing printer boards,

1:06:43.240 --> 1:06:44.480
 circuit boards.

1:06:44.480 --> 1:06:46.920
 So I would leave on a Thursday night,

1:06:46.920 --> 1:06:50.480
 work three 18 hour shifts at Lexmark,

1:06:50.480 --> 1:06:54.120
 come back home on Monday.

1:06:54.120 --> 1:06:56.000
 Got married, faked a car accident

1:06:56.000 --> 1:07:02.160
 to get the rest of the money that I needed to get married.

1:07:02.160 --> 1:07:07.240
 And the faking on that, man, I had bought a Chevy Spectrum

1:07:07.240 --> 1:07:08.080
 at a car auction.

1:07:08.080 --> 1:07:09.840
 Gave like $500 for it.

1:07:09.840 --> 1:07:14.040
 My aunt had previously defrauded USAA insurance

1:07:14.040 --> 1:07:16.360
 on a car accident, and she was telling me all about it.

1:07:16.360 --> 1:07:18.440
 She's like, look, go down to this chiropractor.

1:07:18.440 --> 1:07:19.940
 Make sure you get the insurance where

1:07:19.940 --> 1:07:21.320
 they'll pay for a rental car.

1:07:21.320 --> 1:07:22.480
 They'll pay lost wages.

1:07:22.480 --> 1:07:24.160
 I was like, they pay lost wages?

1:07:24.160 --> 1:07:25.760
 She's like, yeah, they pay lost wages.

1:07:25.760 --> 1:07:26.960
 I was like, hmm.

1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:29.120
 She's like, by the way, you work for me.

1:07:29.120 --> 1:07:32.000
 And I was like, I work for you.

1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:34.400
 And you get to define the wage.

1:07:34.400 --> 1:07:37.120
 And you could also define how long you were unable to work.

1:07:37.120 --> 1:07:37.760
 Exactly.

1:07:37.760 --> 1:07:38.360
 Exactly.

1:07:38.360 --> 1:07:40.760
 And the chiropractor will sign off on any damn thing.

1:07:40.760 --> 1:07:45.720
 So my cousin, Ronnie, he figures out that I'm going.

1:07:45.720 --> 1:07:47.840
 He finds out I'm going to fake this car accident.

1:07:47.840 --> 1:07:48.360
 So he comes to me.

1:07:48.360 --> 1:07:49.680
 He's like, hey, man, can I get in on that?

1:07:49.680 --> 1:07:51.440
 I was like, yeah, man, you get on that.

1:07:51.440 --> 1:07:53.960
 So this kid, he's five days younger than I am.

1:07:53.960 --> 1:07:55.760
 This kid, he goes to the dentist the day

1:07:55.760 --> 1:07:58.200
 that we're faking it, has a tooth pulled,

1:07:58.200 --> 1:08:01.040
 tells the dentist not to numb it, not to stitch it,

1:08:01.040 --> 1:08:02.320
 just pull it.

1:08:02.320 --> 1:08:04.560
 So he shows up.

1:08:04.560 --> 1:08:06.360
 He shows up the day that we're driving out

1:08:06.360 --> 1:08:07.120
 to fake the accident.

1:08:07.120 --> 1:08:08.360
 He's got blood all over his shirt.

1:08:08.360 --> 1:08:09.960
 He's still bleeding out of the mouth and everything else.

1:08:09.960 --> 1:08:10.760
 I'm like, are you OK?

1:08:10.760 --> 1:08:12.160
 He's like, yeah, man, it's going to be good.

1:08:12.160 --> 1:08:12.960
 It's going to be good.

1:08:12.960 --> 1:08:14.680
 I'm like, OK.

1:08:14.680 --> 1:08:17.240
 My mom, by this point, I'm living with my grandparents.

1:08:17.240 --> 1:08:20.280
 My mom is up in the head of a hollow.

1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:22.040
 So we're like, we'll just do it up there.

1:08:22.040 --> 1:08:25.080
 We'll go act like we're visiting my mom on the way back out,

1:08:25.080 --> 1:08:26.480
 ran over a mountain.

1:08:26.480 --> 1:08:27.240
 OK.

1:08:27.240 --> 1:08:30.640
 So we go visit and everything, come back out that night,

1:08:30.640 --> 1:08:32.360
 run over the side of the hill.

1:08:32.360 --> 1:08:33.840
 Me and Ronnie walk back up.

1:08:33.840 --> 1:08:35.840
 Of course, it totals the car.

1:08:35.840 --> 1:08:37.960
 Walk back to my mom's, acting like we've wrecked.

1:08:37.960 --> 1:08:40.000
 She knows what time it is and everything else.

1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:41.800
 And file the claims.

1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:44.400
 So that gets the money to get married.

1:08:44.400 --> 1:08:49.080
 And me and my wife moved from Hazard to Lexington.

1:08:49.080 --> 1:08:57.640
 And I'm the kid that my crime, usually, if I was a single guy,

1:08:57.640 --> 1:08:58.960
 wouldn't break the law.

1:08:58.960 --> 1:08:59.440
 Wouldn't.

1:08:59.440 --> 1:09:00.520
 I would be all right.

1:09:00.520 --> 1:09:03.280
 But females involved, oh, yeah.

1:09:03.280 --> 1:09:03.760
 Oh, yeah.

1:09:03.760 --> 1:09:04.640
 Got to spend the money.

1:09:04.640 --> 1:09:05.640
 Got to show them gifts.

1:09:05.640 --> 1:09:07.840
 Everything else was never enough to show love

1:09:07.840 --> 1:09:09.280
 in some sort of healthy way.

1:09:09.280 --> 1:09:10.480
 Always had to go overboard.

1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:12.240
 And typically, it was buying or stealing

1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:13.440
 some sort of expensive crap.

1:09:13.440 --> 1:09:15.200
 So that was the thing.

1:09:15.200 --> 1:09:19.120
 That was the way you show love is by buying expensive gifts.

1:09:19.120 --> 1:09:20.680
 Or something overboard.

1:09:20.680 --> 1:09:24.360
 Back then, with Susan, initially, it was,

1:09:24.360 --> 1:09:25.520
 don't worry about working.

1:09:25.520 --> 1:09:26.480
 I got it.

1:09:26.480 --> 1:09:27.980
 You just worry about going to school.

1:09:27.980 --> 1:09:29.480
 She was a music major.

1:09:29.480 --> 1:09:31.560
 I was like, you just worry about going to school.

1:09:31.560 --> 1:09:34.040
 So don't worry about cooking and cleaning.

1:09:34.040 --> 1:09:34.560
 I got it.

1:09:34.560 --> 1:09:35.360
 I got it.

1:09:35.360 --> 1:09:37.800
 So not only was I this guy that was going overboard,

1:09:37.800 --> 1:09:40.200
 but I was kind of a control freak, too.

1:09:40.200 --> 1:09:41.000
 So no, I got it.

1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:41.480
 I got it.

1:09:41.480 --> 1:09:42.240
 I got it.

1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:47.760
 So here I am, 60 hour a week job, 18 hour class load,

1:09:47.760 --> 1:09:48.760
 cooking and cleaning.

1:09:48.760 --> 1:09:50.320
 Something had to give.

1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:51.200
 I quit the job.

1:09:51.200 --> 1:09:51.880
 I couldn't do it.

1:09:51.880 --> 1:09:55.080
 Quit the job and start back in fraud.

1:09:55.080 --> 1:09:57.960
 And trying to hide that from her at the same time.

1:09:57.960 --> 1:09:59.720
 So it was initially telemarketing fraud.

1:10:03.720 --> 1:10:07.240
 The first job I had was a telemarketer at a cemetery,

1:10:07.240 --> 1:10:08.760
 selling gravesites.

1:10:08.760 --> 1:10:11.320
 And then that ended.

1:10:11.320 --> 1:10:13.640
 Went over to work for the Shriners Circus, Shriners

1:10:13.640 --> 1:10:14.280
 Hospital.

1:10:14.280 --> 1:10:16.440
 And it was a third party company that

1:10:16.440 --> 1:10:17.780
 was doing all the telemarketing.

1:10:17.780 --> 1:10:19.680
 Made really good money doing that.

1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:21.420
 That job ended.

1:10:21.420 --> 1:10:25.120
 And then they pivoted over to working with Kiwanis Clubs,

1:10:25.120 --> 1:10:29.280
 selling food baskets to the food banks and everything.

1:10:29.280 --> 1:10:34.880
 So I stole the phone list and started at my own Kiwanis Club

1:10:34.880 --> 1:10:38.000
 and would do the telemarketing, go out twice a week

1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:39.440
 and pick up checks.

1:10:39.440 --> 1:10:44.920
 Well, what happened was is I'm going out picking up checks,

1:10:44.920 --> 1:10:46.200
 go knock on a door.

1:10:46.200 --> 1:10:48.440
 Turns out one of the persons that I had called

1:10:48.440 --> 1:10:50.800
 was a law enforcement officer.

1:10:50.800 --> 1:10:54.000
 So he was like, who are you?

1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:55.360
 I'm with the Kiwanis Club.

1:10:55.360 --> 1:10:57.320
 And he's like, no, you're not.

1:10:57.320 --> 1:11:00.880
 So got arrested, spent three months in a county jail

1:11:00.880 --> 1:11:03.080
 for theft by deception.

1:11:03.080 --> 1:11:04.240
 Got out.

1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:09.120
 And we had to move from Lexington back to Hazard

1:11:09.120 --> 1:11:10.920
 and live with Susan's parents.

1:11:10.920 --> 1:11:15.080
 They had gotten a desktop computer, HP.

1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:18.640
 And I started surfing around online.

1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:19.880
 Found eBay.

1:11:19.880 --> 1:11:22.800
 And didn't really know how to make money on eBay.

1:11:22.800 --> 1:11:28.200
 At about the same time, I'm committing low level frauds

1:11:28.200 --> 1:11:29.000
 online.

1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:30.960
 And I don't really talk about that in the past.

1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:32.920
 The first time I've really talked about that.

1:11:32.920 --> 1:11:37.560
 But I would pay for it with bad checks.

1:11:37.560 --> 1:11:41.160
 So more person, so not using a platform like eBay and more.

1:11:41.160 --> 1:11:44.080
 I would find somebody that had like a stereo system on eBay,

1:11:44.080 --> 1:11:44.920
 something like that.

1:11:44.920 --> 1:11:46.800
 And I'd pay for it with a bad check

1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:49.880
 and would rely on them not to chase me

1:11:49.880 --> 1:11:51.680
 because they were out of state at that point.

1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:53.960
 And the dollar amounts were very low.

1:11:53.960 --> 1:11:56.480
 So got the money to move to finally

1:11:56.480 --> 1:11:58.800
 did those schemes enough to get the money

1:11:58.800 --> 1:12:01.760
 to move back to Lexington.

1:12:01.760 --> 1:12:02.760
 Got to Lexington.

1:12:02.760 --> 1:12:04.880
 And by this point, I'm doing, like I said,

1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:07.200
 these schemes on eBay.

1:12:07.200 --> 1:12:09.160
 And I'm like, there's got to be a better way

1:12:09.160 --> 1:12:10.200
 to make money on eBay.

1:12:10.200 --> 1:12:11.000
 Got to be.

1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:13.560
 So didn't really know how.

1:12:13.560 --> 1:12:16.520
 One night, I'm watching Inside Edition with Bill Riley.

1:12:16.520 --> 1:12:18.400
 And they're profiling Beanie Babies.

1:12:18.400 --> 1:12:19.760
 So I'm sitting there watching.

1:12:19.760 --> 1:12:21.960
 The one they're profiling is this one called Peanut,

1:12:21.960 --> 1:12:23.520
 the Royal Blue Elephant.

1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:25.680
 Selling for $1,500 on eBay.

1:12:25.680 --> 1:12:27.200
 I'm sitting there going like, shit,

1:12:27.200 --> 1:12:30.440
 I need to find me a peanut.

1:12:30.440 --> 1:12:32.000
 My initial thought was, well, there's

1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:33.880
 got to be one in one of these Hallmark stores

1:12:33.880 --> 1:12:35.440
 in Kentucky someplace.

1:12:35.440 --> 1:12:36.880
 So I skip class the next day.

1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:39.640
 Went out around all the Hallmark stores looking for peanut.

1:12:39.640 --> 1:12:40.880
 No, idiot.

1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:43.720
 He's on eBay for $1,500.

1:12:43.720 --> 1:12:49.280
 So after a few hours of that, I'm like, hmm.

1:12:49.280 --> 1:12:51.440
 Turns out they had a little gray Beanie Baby elephants

1:12:51.440 --> 1:12:52.760
 for $8.

1:12:52.760 --> 1:12:54.440
 Picked up one of those for $8.

1:12:54.440 --> 1:12:56.040
 Stopped by Kroger on the way home.

1:12:56.040 --> 1:12:58.320
 Picked up a pack of Blue Rit dye.

1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:00.440
 Went home, tried to dye the little guy.

1:13:00.440 --> 1:13:02.560
 So that was a nightmare.

1:13:02.560 --> 1:13:04.680
 Turns out they're made out of polyester.

1:13:04.680 --> 1:13:05.760
 Get them out of the bath.

1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:08.480
 Looks like they've got the mange.

1:13:08.480 --> 1:13:11.680
 And what happens is, so I'm trying to dye the damn thing.

1:13:11.680 --> 1:13:13.280
 I'm like, well, that's not going to work.

1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:14.680
 That's just not going to work.

1:13:14.680 --> 1:13:17.320
 So I got online, found a picture of a real one,

1:13:17.320 --> 1:13:20.800
 posted it on eBay, and I was like, well, what I can do

1:13:20.800 --> 1:13:25.520
 is I can claim that's the one I've got

1:13:25.520 --> 1:13:28.400
 and then maybe claim that it got messed up in the mail

1:13:28.400 --> 1:13:29.400
 and work out like that.

1:13:29.400 --> 1:13:32.080
 So posted a picture of a real one online.

1:13:32.080 --> 1:13:33.640
 Woman thought I had the real thing.

1:13:33.640 --> 1:13:35.600
 She wins the bid.

1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:37.480
 That social engineering kicks in immediately.

1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:39.480
 I didn't want to be on the defensive.

1:13:39.480 --> 1:13:41.360
 I wanted to put her on the defensive.

1:13:41.360 --> 1:13:44.000
 So as soon as she wins the bid, I send her a message.

1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:46.160
 Hey, we've not done any business before.

1:13:46.160 --> 1:13:47.760
 I don't even know if I can trust you.

1:13:47.760 --> 1:13:50.640
 What I need you to do, protects us both.

1:13:50.640 --> 1:13:52.240
 Go down the US Postal Service.

1:13:52.240 --> 1:13:54.960
 Get two money orders totaling $1,500.

1:13:54.960 --> 1:13:57.520
 Send them to me issued by the US government.

1:13:57.520 --> 1:14:00.040
 That way we're both protected.

1:14:00.040 --> 1:14:02.560
 Soon as I get the money orders, I'll send you your animal.

1:14:02.560 --> 1:14:03.320
 She believed that.

1:14:03.320 --> 1:14:04.680
 Didn't ask any questions at all.

1:14:04.680 --> 1:14:07.000
 She believed that.

1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:07.960
 Sent me the money orders.

1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:09.640
 I cashed them out.

1:14:09.640 --> 1:14:10.960
 Sent her the creature.

1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:12.640
 Immediately got a phone call.

1:14:12.640 --> 1:14:13.840
 I didn't order this.

1:14:13.840 --> 1:14:16.840
 My response, lady, you ordered a blue elephant.

1:14:16.840 --> 1:14:19.840
 I sent you a blue fish elephant.

1:14:19.840 --> 1:14:21.880
 And she got pissed.

1:14:21.880 --> 1:14:23.920
 And she kept calling.

1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:25.440
 What I found out, and that's really

1:14:25.440 --> 1:14:27.800
 the first lesson of cybercrime that most of these criminals,

1:14:27.800 --> 1:14:29.160
 including self, learns.

1:14:29.160 --> 1:14:30.680
 If you delay a victim long enough,

1:14:30.680 --> 1:14:31.960
 just keep putting them off.

1:14:31.960 --> 1:14:33.720
 A lot of them, they get exasperated,

1:14:33.720 --> 1:14:35.520
 throw their hands in the air, walk away.

1:14:35.520 --> 1:14:36.720
 You don't hear from them.

1:14:36.720 --> 1:14:40.200
 And none of them, to this day, none of them

1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:41.480
 complain to law enforcement.

1:14:41.480 --> 1:14:42.800
 They eat it.

1:14:42.800 --> 1:14:47.400
 So it's a mixture of you're exhausted by the process,

1:14:47.400 --> 1:14:49.520
 so it's just easier to walk away,

1:14:49.520 --> 1:14:52.160
 and second, almost like an embarrassment.

1:14:52.160 --> 1:14:54.880
 So there's a whole slew of reasons, all right?

1:14:54.880 --> 1:14:56.760
 There's the exhaustion, certainly.

1:14:56.760 --> 1:14:57.880
 There's the embarrassment.

1:14:57.880 --> 1:14:59.680
 So if you figure out, if you look at it today,

1:14:59.680 --> 1:15:00.960
 where does the embarrassment come from?

1:15:00.960 --> 1:15:03.560
 Well, the media, family members,

1:15:03.560 --> 1:15:06.520
 we're all very good about blaming the victim for crimes.

1:15:06.520 --> 1:15:07.600
 Why would you click on the link?

1:15:07.600 --> 1:15:09.280
 Why would you send money to somebody you don't know?

1:15:09.280 --> 1:15:10.240
 Blah, blah, blah.

1:15:10.240 --> 1:15:12.240
 So you've got that that's going on.

1:15:12.240 --> 1:15:15.720
 You've got the issue of, who do you complain to?

1:15:15.720 --> 1:15:16.960
 Back then, you didn't know.

1:15:16.960 --> 1:15:18.160
 Do you complain to local police?

1:15:18.160 --> 1:15:21.240
 Because she's in another state, so which local police

1:15:21.240 --> 1:15:22.440
 do you complain to?

1:15:22.440 --> 1:15:23.600
 Do you complain to the feds?

1:15:23.600 --> 1:15:25.400
 Well, the dollar amounts aren't high enough

1:15:25.400 --> 1:15:26.440
 to complain to feds.

1:15:26.440 --> 1:15:28.200
 Feds are going to tell you to go local.

1:15:28.200 --> 1:15:30.720
 Local's going to tell you, hey, it happened in Kentucky.

1:15:30.720 --> 1:15:31.600
 Complain to them.

1:15:31.600 --> 1:15:34.080
 Kentucky's going to tell you, well, shit, you're over there.

1:15:34.080 --> 1:15:35.000
 We need you to come in.

1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:38.320
 So there's this whole issue of the jurisdiction,

1:15:38.320 --> 1:15:41.480
 of the blame factor, everything else.

1:15:41.480 --> 1:15:45.240
 So I got away with that crime and did it under my own name

1:15:45.240 --> 1:15:46.920
 at that point.

1:15:46.920 --> 1:15:49.360
 I kept going and got better at it,

1:15:49.360 --> 1:15:51.760
 started to understand how to hide identities,

1:15:51.760 --> 1:15:52.480
 things like that.

1:15:52.480 --> 1:15:54.720
 Started selling pirated software.

1:15:54.720 --> 1:15:58.080
 Pirated software led into installing mod chips.

1:15:58.080 --> 1:16:02.040
 The initial pirated software was Sega Saturn, PlayStation 1.

1:16:02.040 --> 1:16:03.760
 Well, you had to have a mod chip in those

1:16:03.760 --> 1:16:06.480
 to play the pirated disk, so I started

1:16:06.480 --> 1:16:08.760
 selling and installing mod chips.

1:16:08.760 --> 1:16:11.680
 That led into installing mod chips in the cable television

1:16:11.680 --> 1:16:15.200
 boxes so you could watch all the pay per view, which in turn

1:16:15.200 --> 1:16:18.160
 led into programming satellite DSS cards.

1:16:18.160 --> 1:16:20.880
 Those 18 inch RCA satellite systems,

1:16:20.880 --> 1:16:24.600
 pull the card out of it, program it, turns on all the channels.

1:16:24.600 --> 1:16:26.080
 Started doing that.

1:16:26.080 --> 1:16:28.400
 Can we just pause?

1:16:28.400 --> 1:16:33.800
 That is very entrepreneurial.

1:16:33.800 --> 1:16:41.160
 So just technically, so there's laws and rules

1:16:41.160 --> 1:16:43.320
 that you're breaking nonstop.

1:16:43.320 --> 1:16:46.920
 So there's also legitimate ways of doing

1:16:46.920 --> 1:16:49.880
 that, which is break the rules of the conventions of the past.

1:16:49.880 --> 1:16:51.360
 That's the first principles thing.

1:16:51.360 --> 1:16:55.400
 That's what Elon Musk and his ilk do all the time.

1:16:55.400 --> 1:16:59.520
 That is guts and brilliance.

1:16:59.520 --> 1:17:03.080
 But when it's crossing the lines of the law,

1:17:03.080 --> 1:17:07.240
 actually sometimes the law is outdated.

1:17:07.240 --> 1:17:09.080
 The thing is, as a human being, you

1:17:09.080 --> 1:17:12.720
 have to then compute the ethical damage you're doing.

1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:14.000
 Like ethically, the damage you're

1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:16.720
 doing about other human beings, that is fundamentally

1:17:16.720 --> 1:17:19.040
 the thing that you're breaking, is you're

1:17:19.040 --> 1:17:22.720
 adding to the suffering in the world in one way or another,

1:17:22.720 --> 1:17:24.160
 and you're justifying it.

1:17:24.160 --> 1:17:27.800
 But in terms of me sort of as an engineer,

1:17:27.800 --> 1:17:29.440
 that is some gutsy thinking.

1:17:29.440 --> 1:17:34.360
 That's how Woz and Steve Jobs thought.

1:17:34.360 --> 1:17:35.680
 That's innovation.

1:17:35.680 --> 1:17:40.880
 And maybe just think, if you can introspect your thinking

1:17:40.880 --> 1:17:44.720
 process here, this is a new, I like

1:17:44.720 --> 1:17:48.800
 how you remember this in HP, this

1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:50.160
 is a totally new thing to you.

1:17:50.160 --> 1:17:53.640
 Computers is another domain.

1:17:53.640 --> 1:17:56.040
 How were you figuring these puzzles out,

1:17:56.040 --> 1:17:58.320
 presumably mostly alone?

1:17:58.320 --> 1:17:58.960
 Alone.

1:17:58.960 --> 1:18:03.160
 When you were thinking through these problems, is there,

1:18:03.160 --> 1:18:04.720
 this is a strange question to ask,

1:18:04.720 --> 1:18:08.640
 but what is your thinking process?

1:18:08.640 --> 1:18:10.800
 What is your approach to solving these problems?

1:18:10.800 --> 1:18:15.680
 So the approach is you do something, and you fuck it up,

1:18:15.680 --> 1:18:20.160
 and you're like, you think back, OK, how do I fix that?

1:18:20.160 --> 1:18:23.880
 You fix that aspect, you commit the crime again.

1:18:23.880 --> 1:18:26.720
 And it goes a little bit further, and it screws up.

1:18:26.720 --> 1:18:28.640
 OK, how do I fix that?

1:18:28.640 --> 1:18:29.640
 What's the issue on that?

1:18:29.640 --> 1:18:30.440
 How do I fix that?

1:18:30.440 --> 1:18:32.880
 So there's not a deep design thinking like that?

1:18:32.880 --> 1:18:33.960
 Later on, it becomes that.

1:18:33.960 --> 1:18:36.800
 Once you lay that groundwork of the way

1:18:36.800 --> 1:18:39.160
 these schemes are working, it becomes that.

1:18:39.160 --> 1:18:42.920
 And you can apply that to other things in cybercrime

1:18:42.920 --> 1:18:44.480
 as a whole.

1:18:44.480 --> 1:18:47.640
 But initially, it's basically trial and error.

1:18:47.640 --> 1:18:50.880
 You've got a problem, how do you solve that problem?

1:18:50.880 --> 1:18:54.400
 So I'm committing these crimes under my name,

1:18:54.400 --> 1:18:56.360
 how do I solve that?

1:18:56.360 --> 1:18:57.920
 Well, one of the first principles

1:18:57.920 --> 1:18:59.680
 that we started to teach on Shadow Crew

1:18:59.680 --> 1:19:03.920
 is all crime should begin with identity theft.

1:19:03.920 --> 1:19:05.680
 That's one of the main first principles

1:19:05.680 --> 1:19:08.160
 that a lot of people to this day still don't really get.

1:19:08.160 --> 1:19:10.240
 All right, why would I commit a crime under my name

1:19:10.240 --> 1:19:12.080
 if I can do it under your name?

1:19:12.080 --> 1:19:13.840
 So that's one of the big buffers.

1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:15.440
 And that takes trial and error to get

1:19:15.440 --> 1:19:17.480
 to that point where you start to understand

1:19:17.480 --> 1:19:20.960
 that's the way crime should operate if you're a criminal.

1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:25.000
 But with me, it's trial and error.

1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:28.160
 It's that childhood where that mindset

1:19:28.160 --> 1:19:31.360
 is kind of ingrained in you where you're looking

1:19:31.360 --> 1:19:35.160
 for ways, let's say nontraditional ways

1:19:35.160 --> 1:19:37.840
 of getting around things or getting through things.

1:19:37.840 --> 1:19:41.160
 I mean, one of the questions I'll probably ask this later

1:19:41.160 --> 1:19:44.480
 is there's also a unique aspect to the outcome

1:19:44.480 --> 1:19:47.440
 of what you were doing, which is you weren't,

1:19:47.440 --> 1:19:50.480
 you didn't get caught for a very long time.

1:19:50.480 --> 1:19:52.000
 We'll talk about why that is.

1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:54.000
 And the thing is, it's so interesting,

1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:59.000
 all crime probably should, to be effective,

1:19:59.200 --> 1:20:01.360
 should start with identity theft.

1:20:01.360 --> 1:20:02.760
 I like that identity theft

1:20:02.760 --> 1:20:05.240
 because identity theft can take so many forms.

1:20:05.240 --> 1:20:06.880
 Right, right.

1:20:06.880 --> 1:20:09.160
 So yes, so Shadow Crew.

1:20:09.160 --> 1:20:13.240
 So what's, so as we're, you started with love.

1:20:13.240 --> 1:20:14.080
 Started with love.

1:20:14.080 --> 1:20:17.160
 So now we're doing these schemes online.

1:20:18.360 --> 1:20:20.240
 I'm selling to these,

1:20:20.240 --> 1:20:22.000
 I'm programming these satellite DSS cards.

1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:24.160
 And one of the interesting things,

1:20:24.160 --> 1:20:26.000
 and you still see that to this day,

1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:29.080
 is something will happen

1:20:29.080 --> 1:20:33.440
 that will create an industry for criminals, all right?

1:20:33.440 --> 1:20:37.400
 So what happened is Canada, Canadian judge,

1:20:37.400 --> 1:20:38.440
 rules about the same time

1:20:38.440 --> 1:20:40.560
 that I'm doing these satellite cards,

1:20:40.560 --> 1:20:41.920
 Canadian judge comes out and says,

1:20:41.920 --> 1:20:46.920
 hey, it's legal for my citizens to pirate those signals.

1:20:47.560 --> 1:20:49.960
 And his reasoning was is since RCA

1:20:49.960 --> 1:20:51.480
 doesn't sell the systems up here,

1:20:51.480 --> 1:20:53.920
 my citizens can pirate it.

1:20:53.920 --> 1:20:57.440
 Okay, so what happens is is overnight,

1:20:57.440 --> 1:20:59.680
 about the same time PayPal comes into play.

1:20:59.680 --> 1:21:03.280
 So PayPal is coming right online at about the same time.

1:21:03.280 --> 1:21:05.400
 Overnight, a little cottage industry

1:21:05.400 --> 1:21:07.240
 pops up in the United States.

1:21:07.240 --> 1:21:09.400
 You go down to Best Buy, buy the system for $100,

1:21:09.400 --> 1:21:11.360
 take it out in the parking lot, open system up,

1:21:11.360 --> 1:21:13.000
 pull it, open box up, pull the system out,

1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:14.640
 pull the card out, throw the system away,

1:21:14.640 --> 1:21:17.840
 program the card, ship its ass to Canada, $500 a pop.

1:21:17.840 --> 1:21:19.920
 Started doing that.

1:21:19.920 --> 1:21:21.520
 Business is good.

1:21:21.520 --> 1:21:23.760
 Making, you know, $3,000, $4,000 a week doing that.

1:21:23.760 --> 1:21:25.160
 I'm like, yeah, that's good.

1:21:26.040 --> 1:21:29.000
 I have so many orders, I can't fill all the orders

1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:30.560
 and quickly think to myself,

1:21:31.920 --> 1:21:33.720
 why do I need to fill any of them?

1:21:33.720 --> 1:21:34.960
 They're in Canada.

1:21:34.960 --> 1:21:35.960
 I'm down here.

1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:39.160
 You know, who are they gonna complain to?

1:21:39.160 --> 1:21:42.960
 Because I already found out people don't complain, all right?

1:21:42.960 --> 1:21:45.160
 They're not gonna complain to anybody.

1:21:45.160 --> 1:21:46.120
 So I start not.

1:21:46.120 --> 1:21:46.960
 Especially in Canada.

1:21:46.960 --> 1:21:47.960
 Especially in Canada.

1:21:47.960 --> 1:21:50.560
 And I'm having them send money.

1:21:50.560 --> 1:21:53.000
 That's when PayPal's first into play.

1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:58.000
 And it amazes me that everybody is using PayPal.

1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:00.360
 It's like, you don't even have to really ask.

1:22:00.360 --> 1:22:01.400
 They're like, can we pay by,

1:22:01.400 --> 1:22:03.240
 yeah, you can pay all day long by PayPal.

1:22:03.240 --> 1:22:05.840
 And PayPal had no clue what they were doing with security.

1:22:05.840 --> 1:22:08.280
 So it's like, okay.

1:22:08.280 --> 1:22:09.800
 So they're sending money to PayPal.

1:22:09.800 --> 1:22:13.280
 I'm having the PayPal cashed out to bank accounts

1:22:13.280 --> 1:22:14.640
 in my name at that point.

1:22:15.520 --> 1:22:17.400
 And I get scared because by that point,

1:22:17.400 --> 1:22:20.080
 I'm still in four to $6,000 a week.

1:22:20.080 --> 1:22:23.440
 And I'm like, somebody's gonna be looking at money laundering.

1:22:23.440 --> 1:22:24.920
 So get it in my head.

1:22:24.920 --> 1:22:27.160
 I'm like, best thing that I can do

1:22:27.160 --> 1:22:28.880
 is get a fake driver's license,

1:22:28.880 --> 1:22:31.120
 open up a bank account using that driver's license,

1:22:31.120 --> 1:22:33.240
 cash out at the ATM.

1:22:33.240 --> 1:22:34.080
 Good.

1:22:34.080 --> 1:22:35.400
 No idea where to get a fake ID.

1:22:35.400 --> 1:22:36.480
 Not a clue.

1:22:36.480 --> 1:22:38.640
 So I get online, looked around.

1:22:38.640 --> 1:22:40.280
 Spent a couple of weeks looking around.

1:22:40.280 --> 1:22:41.480
 Thought I found a guy.

1:22:41.480 --> 1:22:43.840
 He went by the screen name of Fake ID Man.

1:22:43.840 --> 1:22:46.920
 Thought I found a guy, sent him $200, sent him my picture.

1:22:46.920 --> 1:22:48.120
 Dude rips me off.

1:22:48.120 --> 1:22:52.720
 And I'm like, what the hell, man?

1:22:52.720 --> 1:22:53.560
 Oh, I got played.

1:22:53.560 --> 1:22:57.200
 He had a little website set up with reviews.

1:22:57.200 --> 1:22:58.720
 And I'm like, oh, it's all legitimate.

1:22:58.720 --> 1:23:01.080
 He's building that trust that I talked about.

1:23:01.080 --> 1:23:05.400
 So the end result, I got pissed.

1:23:05.400 --> 1:23:10.400
 And there was no site that dealt with anything

1:23:10.400 --> 1:23:14.000
 criminal or cyber crime related.

1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:17.040
 The only real avenue you had was an IRC chat session,

1:23:17.040 --> 1:23:18.520
 internet relay chat.

1:23:18.520 --> 1:23:20.760
 And that, I'm sure you've been on that.

1:23:20.760 --> 1:23:22.800
 It's this rolling chat board.

1:23:22.800 --> 1:23:24.680
 You don't know who the hell you're talking to.

1:23:24.680 --> 1:23:26.000
 Most of them are full of shit.

1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:27.280
 You can't trust anybody.

1:23:27.280 --> 1:23:29.440
 And you're sitting there trying to conduct business.

1:23:29.440 --> 1:23:32.200
 So if somebody claims they've got a product or service,

1:23:32.200 --> 1:23:33.040
 do they have it?

1:23:33.040 --> 1:23:33.880
 Does it work?

1:23:33.880 --> 1:23:34.700
 Are they just gonna rip you off?

1:23:34.700 --> 1:23:37.000
 Because in those channels, everyone's a criminal.

1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:42.000
 I kept looking around and I've happened upon a website

1:23:42.960 --> 1:23:44.600
 called Counterfeit Library.

1:23:44.600 --> 1:23:48.160
 And Counterfeit Library only dealt with counterfeit degrees

1:23:48.160 --> 1:23:51.720
 and certificates, degree mail type stuff.

1:23:51.720 --> 1:23:55.320
 But they had a forum and no one was using the forum.

1:23:55.320 --> 1:23:58.360
 So I basically get on there and bitch every day.

1:23:58.360 --> 1:24:00.360
 I got ripped off, don't know what to do,

1:24:00.360 --> 1:24:01.600
 bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

1:24:01.600 --> 1:24:03.320
 About the same time I started doing that,

1:24:03.320 --> 1:24:04.840
 two other guys show up.

1:24:04.840 --> 1:24:07.360
 One's named Mr. X, he's out of Los Angeles.

1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:08.720
 Other guy's named Beelzebub,

1:24:08.720 --> 1:24:11.760
 he's out of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.

1:24:11.760 --> 1:24:13.560
 And we all become buddies.

1:24:13.560 --> 1:24:15.240
 So a few weeks of me bitching,

1:24:15.240 --> 1:24:16.800
 a few weeks of them responding.

1:24:17.760 --> 1:24:20.800
 Beelzebub gets me on ICQ and he sends me a message.

1:24:20.800 --> 1:24:22.560
 He's like, I went by the screen name of Gollum

1:24:22.560 --> 1:24:24.080
 at that point, Gollum Fun.

1:24:24.080 --> 1:24:26.120
 And he's like, Gollum, I can make you

1:24:26.120 --> 1:24:27.200
 a fake driver's license.

1:24:27.200 --> 1:24:28.640
 And I was like, well, motherfucker, do it.

1:24:28.640 --> 1:24:30.660
 And he's like, well, I'm gonna charge you for it.

1:24:30.660 --> 1:24:32.360
 I'm like, yeah, you are.

1:24:32.360 --> 1:24:33.880
 He's like, I am.

1:24:33.880 --> 1:24:35.440
 I was like, no, you're not.

1:24:35.440 --> 1:24:37.980
 And he's like, look, man, he said,

1:24:37.980 --> 1:24:40.240
 this business, if you're gonna do this,

1:24:40.240 --> 1:24:44.120
 you have to trust people or you're gonna fail.

1:24:44.120 --> 1:24:46.720
 He said, so I'm gonna charge you $200,

1:24:46.720 --> 1:24:49.000
 but I'm gonna send you a driver's license.

1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:51.080
 Well, by this point, I'm friends with the people

1:24:51.080 --> 1:24:53.080
 who own Counterfeit Library.

1:24:53.080 --> 1:24:55.640
 We're emailing, chatting, everything else.

1:24:55.640 --> 1:24:59.580
 And I tell him, I'm like, okay, I'm gonna send you $200.

1:24:59.580 --> 1:25:02.360
 That way, when you rip me off, I'll have them ban you

1:25:02.360 --> 1:25:04.000
 and I don't have to deal with you anymore.

1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:04.880
 And he's like, bet.

1:25:04.880 --> 1:25:06.360
 I'm like, okay.

1:25:06.360 --> 1:25:08.880
 So I sent him $200, sent him my picture.

1:25:09.800 --> 1:25:11.680
 Two weeks later, I get a driver's license.

1:25:11.680 --> 1:25:13.720
 Name is Steven Schwecki out of Ohio.

1:25:13.720 --> 1:25:17.360
 And real guy, worked at ADP payroll to this day,

1:25:17.360 --> 1:25:19.740
 works at ADP, is where the guy works.

1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:22.660
 Got the driver's license.

1:25:22.660 --> 1:25:24.360
 And to me, at that point in time,

1:25:24.360 --> 1:25:27.160
 it was the prettiest thing that I'd ever seen.

1:25:27.160 --> 1:25:29.540
 You know, I'd never seen a fake ID before.

1:25:29.540 --> 1:25:30.840
 I thought it was great.

1:25:30.840 --> 1:25:33.680
 Turns out, you know, looking back, it was like, eh.

1:25:33.680 --> 1:25:35.320
 So, but.

1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:39.600
 That is kind of a strong first step

1:25:39.600 --> 1:25:42.560
 in creating a fake identity.

1:25:42.560 --> 1:25:44.120
 Very strong, very strong.

1:25:44.120 --> 1:25:47.160
 So this is. So that was like, Gasko just,

1:25:48.360 --> 1:25:53.360
 on the point he made, that if you're gonna be successful

1:25:53.440 --> 1:25:56.640
 in this, you should have people you trust.

1:25:56.640 --> 1:25:58.000
 Is he right on that?

1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:00.040
 Oh, he's absolutely right.

1:26:00.040 --> 1:26:00.880
 He's absolute.

1:26:00.880 --> 1:26:03.680
 So you have to have, this is like mob.

1:26:03.680 --> 1:26:04.520
 You have to.

1:26:04.520 --> 1:26:07.480
 You have to have an inner circle that you trust.

1:26:07.480 --> 1:26:08.800
 You know, I'm sure you've probably

1:26:08.800 --> 1:26:10.240
 heard me say this before.

1:26:11.400 --> 1:26:14.560
 Successful cyber crime, all right?

1:26:14.560 --> 1:26:17.580
 There are three necessities to being successful online

1:26:17.580 --> 1:26:18.520
 if you're a criminal.

1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:21.080
 Three necessities are gathering data,

1:26:21.080 --> 1:26:24.240
 committing the crime, and then cashing it out.

1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:26.720
 All three of those necessities have to work in conjunction.

1:26:26.720 --> 1:26:28.440
 If they don't, the crime fails.

1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:30.760
 The problem, and it's a huge problem,

1:26:30.760 --> 1:26:34.880
 is that one guy can't do all three things.

1:26:34.880 --> 1:26:37.040
 You know, you've got the people who gather the data.

1:26:37.040 --> 1:26:39.680
 Basically, the general store sells people

1:26:39.680 --> 1:26:44.480
 who sell PII, credit card logins, data tools.

1:26:44.480 --> 1:26:46.220
 They always sell the spoofed phone numbers

1:26:46.220 --> 1:26:48.560
 and the RDPs, stuff like that.

1:26:48.560 --> 1:26:49.800
 A lot of the times, those people don't know

1:26:49.800 --> 1:26:51.080
 how to commit the crime.

1:26:51.080 --> 1:26:52.200
 And those people certainly don't know

1:26:52.200 --> 1:26:54.640
 how to launder the money out, put cash in pocket.

1:26:54.640 --> 1:26:58.000
 So you've got, either because of a skill level,

1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:00.160
 sometimes a geographic location,

1:27:00.160 --> 1:27:03.240
 limits what that individual can do, all right?

1:27:03.240 --> 1:27:06.600
 So you have to rely on people who are good in areas

1:27:06.600 --> 1:27:10.640
 where you are not in order for that crime to succeed.

1:27:10.640 --> 1:27:15.380
 And that means you have to trust those people.

1:27:15.380 --> 1:27:17.760
 So what happens with Shadow Crew, all right?

1:27:17.760 --> 1:27:20.160
 So Counterfeit Library is the start, all right?

1:27:21.440 --> 1:27:24.520
 Counterfeit Library transitions over to Shadow Crew.

1:27:24.520 --> 1:27:27.880
 Right before that transition, there's a Ukrainian guy.

1:27:27.880 --> 1:27:29.600
 By the name of Dmitry Golubov.

1:27:29.600 --> 1:27:31.240
 He was a spammer at that point in time.

1:27:31.240 --> 1:27:34.320
 He saw what we were doing with Counterfeit Library

1:27:34.320 --> 1:27:35.960
 and he liked it.

1:27:35.960 --> 1:27:37.760
 He was getting all these credit card details

1:27:37.760 --> 1:27:39.940
 and this kid, I mean, he's a kid.

1:27:39.940 --> 1:27:41.280
 This kid has an idea.

1:27:41.280 --> 1:27:43.560
 And his idea was, I wonder if people would buy

1:27:43.560 --> 1:27:45.200
 stolen credit card details.

1:27:45.200 --> 1:27:47.600
 That's pretty good Ukrainian Russian accent.

1:27:47.600 --> 1:27:52.200
 So he picks up the phone, he calls his buddies.

1:27:52.200 --> 1:27:53.300
 They call their buddies.

1:27:53.300 --> 1:27:56.240
 They have a physical conference in Odessa.

1:27:56.240 --> 1:27:58.440
 150 of these cyber criminals show up.

1:27:58.440 --> 1:28:00.200
 And they launched this idea,

1:28:00.200 --> 1:28:03.080
 this launches a website called Carter Planet,

1:28:03.080 --> 1:28:06.040
 which is the genesis of all modern credit card theft

1:28:06.040 --> 1:28:07.440
 as we know it, all right?

1:28:07.440 --> 1:28:10.680
 And so, remember I mentioned those three necessities

1:28:10.680 --> 1:28:11.580
 of cyber crime.

1:28:12.440 --> 1:28:16.040
 Dmitry had all the credit data in the world.

1:28:16.040 --> 1:28:17.800
 And he partnered with all these other Ukrainians

1:28:17.800 --> 1:28:19.560
 who had all this data as well.

1:28:19.560 --> 1:28:22.240
 The problem was, is so much fraud had been committed

1:28:22.240 --> 1:28:24.100
 on that Eastern side of Europe,

1:28:24.100 --> 1:28:26.480
 that every card had been shut down.

1:28:26.480 --> 1:28:28.880
 Even if you were a legitimate card holder

1:28:28.880 --> 1:28:30.080
 and tried to cash it out,

1:28:30.080 --> 1:28:32.040
 you weren't doing it at that point.

1:28:32.040 --> 1:28:33.720
 So again, those three necessities,

1:28:33.720 --> 1:28:35.840
 gathering data, committing crime, cashing out.

1:28:35.840 --> 1:28:37.520
 Dmitry had the data.

1:28:37.520 --> 1:28:38.960
 They could commit the crime.

1:28:38.960 --> 1:28:41.640
 They could not put cash in pocket.

1:28:41.640 --> 1:28:44.400
 So we were running counterfeit library.

1:28:44.400 --> 1:28:46.120
 One day I get this message,

1:28:46.120 --> 1:28:48.840
 or not a message, one day script shows up.

1:28:48.840 --> 1:28:50.960
 And he posts just on the general forum.

1:28:50.960 --> 1:28:54.280
 He posts, hey, I've got credit card data.

1:28:54.280 --> 1:28:56.640
 Give me an address, give me a burner phone number,

1:28:56.640 --> 1:28:58.960
 wait five business days, order whatever you want to.

1:28:58.960 --> 1:29:01.360
 We had never seen anything like that.

1:29:01.360 --> 1:29:03.680
 We were a PayPal fraud and eBay fraud site,

1:29:03.680 --> 1:29:06.280
 is what we were, and fake driver's licenses.

1:29:06.280 --> 1:29:07.560
 So then, and we had,

1:29:07.560 --> 1:29:09.960
 I guess we had two, 3,000 members at that point.

1:29:09.960 --> 1:29:14.960
 So the response from the members was, that can't be real.

1:29:16.200 --> 1:29:17.600
 You've gotta be law enforcement.

1:29:17.600 --> 1:29:21.080
 It's gotta be trying to get us arrested and everything else.

1:29:21.080 --> 1:29:23.400
 What, let me backtrack a little bit.

1:29:23.400 --> 1:29:27.160
 So the driver's license that I had got,

1:29:27.160 --> 1:29:28.840
 Beelzebub had an idea.

1:29:28.840 --> 1:29:33.400
 What he wanted to do is he wanted to sell driver's licenses.

1:29:34.800 --> 1:29:36.680
 Mr. X wanted to sell social security cards.

1:29:36.680 --> 1:29:39.240
 He made a very passable social security card.

1:29:39.240 --> 1:29:40.960
 Me, I didn't, I had no skill level on that.

1:29:40.960 --> 1:29:42.880
 I knew PayPal fraud and eBay fraud.

1:29:42.880 --> 1:29:45.560
 So Beelzebub was like, I'll tell you what,

1:29:45.560 --> 1:29:47.360
 you be the reviewer.

1:29:47.360 --> 1:29:50.120
 That way you get every product or service that comes in.

1:29:50.120 --> 1:29:53.040
 They'll have to send it to you or let you have access to it.

1:29:53.040 --> 1:29:55.480
 You can learn the entire game.

1:29:55.480 --> 1:29:57.880
 And because you're not selling anything,

1:29:57.880 --> 1:30:01.400
 it gives you legitimacy on the reviews, all right?

1:30:01.400 --> 1:30:02.640
 So I started out as a reviewer,

1:30:02.640 --> 1:30:04.760
 the only reviewer on Counterfeit Library.

1:30:05.640 --> 1:30:09.160
 So over the next year, Beelzebub turns out

1:30:09.160 --> 1:30:10.120
 he was a pot grower.

1:30:10.120 --> 1:30:11.800
 He goes back to growing pot

1:30:11.800 --> 1:30:14.480
 because he wasn't making shit selling driver's licenses.

1:30:14.480 --> 1:30:16.800
 Mr. X, about a year and a half in,

1:30:16.800 --> 1:30:20.560
 he gets arrested cashing out driver's, not credit cards,

1:30:20.560 --> 1:30:24.240
 cashing out to casinos, doing some shit with that.

1:30:24.240 --> 1:30:26.200
 So I'm the only guy left standing

1:30:26.200 --> 1:30:28.400
 and I'm at the top of the heap.

1:30:28.400 --> 1:30:32.600
 And it becomes this thing where if I review somebody,

1:30:32.600 --> 1:30:33.880
 they make a lot of money.

1:30:33.880 --> 1:30:36.720
 If I don't, you don't do business here.

1:30:36.720 --> 1:30:38.800
 So script shows up saying he's got this.

1:30:38.800 --> 1:30:40.520
 I'm the only reviewer on site.

1:30:41.480 --> 1:30:43.960
 People think he's law enforcement.

1:30:43.960 --> 1:30:45.520
 First week it goes like that.

1:30:45.520 --> 1:30:47.320
 After a while, I'm like, okay, I gotta do something.

1:30:47.320 --> 1:30:48.240
 And I'm scared, man,

1:30:48.240 --> 1:30:50.560
 because I'm like, he may be law enforcement.

1:30:50.560 --> 1:30:52.040
 So I get him on ICQ and I'm like,

1:30:52.040 --> 1:30:53.120
 hey, you have to be reviewed.

1:30:53.120 --> 1:30:54.720
 He's like, what the hell is that?

1:30:54.720 --> 1:30:56.840
 So I tell him what it is, he's like, you reviewed me.

1:30:56.840 --> 1:30:58.520
 I was like, yeah, that's the idea.

1:30:58.520 --> 1:31:02.040
 So give him a drop address, give him a burner phone number,

1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:04.440
 wait five business days,

1:31:04.440 --> 1:31:06.840
 and I try to hit Dell for $5,000.

1:31:06.840 --> 1:31:08.160
 The order fails.

1:31:08.160 --> 1:31:10.400
 I get back on ICQ, hey man, it didn't work.

1:31:10.400 --> 1:31:12.000
 He's like, give me one more chance.

1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:13.760
 I was like, look, I'll give you one more chance,

1:31:13.760 --> 1:31:15.080
 but it's your ass after that.

1:31:15.080 --> 1:31:16.720
 He's like, one more chance.

1:31:16.720 --> 1:31:20.080
 I go, okay, give him another address, another phone number,

1:31:20.080 --> 1:31:22.400
 wait another five business days,

1:31:22.400 --> 1:31:25.320
 hit Thompson's Computer Warehouse for $4,000,

1:31:25.320 --> 1:31:26.880
 Dell for $5,000.

1:31:26.880 --> 1:31:28.880
 Order goes through, get the products in.

1:31:29.800 --> 1:31:33.880
 I post that review on Counterfeit Library,

1:31:33.880 --> 1:31:35.600
 and literally overnight,

1:31:35.600 --> 1:31:38.240
 we turn from an eBay PayPal fraud site

1:31:38.240 --> 1:31:40.000
 to a credit theft site.

1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:44.160
 And that becomes a lot of money really quickly for members.

1:31:44.160 --> 1:31:46.760
 So we were doing, now it's called CMP fraud,

1:31:46.760 --> 1:31:47.720
 card not present fraud.

1:31:47.720 --> 1:31:49.720
 So you hit an online merchant

1:31:49.720 --> 1:31:51.280
 with stolen credit card data.

1:31:51.280 --> 1:31:54.560
 Back then, a fairly experienced fraudster

1:31:54.560 --> 1:31:58.640
 could profit 30 to $40,000 a month, okay?

1:31:58.640 --> 1:32:00.800
 Just buying laptops, what have you,

1:32:00.800 --> 1:32:03.080
 and cashing out, put them on eBay for sale

1:32:03.080 --> 1:32:03.920
 and sell them like that.

1:32:03.920 --> 1:32:06.880
 And 30 to 40K a month was the profit on that.

1:32:06.880 --> 1:32:08.520
 Script had a lot of buddies.

1:32:08.520 --> 1:32:11.000
 He had people like Roman Vega,

1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:12.520
 these other guys that would sell

1:32:12.520 --> 1:32:14.120
 not just credit card data,

1:32:14.120 --> 1:32:17.280
 but counterfeit physical credit cards as well.

1:32:17.280 --> 1:32:18.480
 We had, and he.

1:32:18.480 --> 1:32:20.080
 Counterfeit, not stolen.

1:32:20.080 --> 1:32:21.000
 So counterfeit.

1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:22.600
 Counterfeit.

1:32:22.600 --> 1:32:25.160
 That must be tough to do.

1:32:25.160 --> 1:32:26.000
 So the connection.

1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:28.280
 That must be harder than driver's licenses.

1:32:28.280 --> 1:32:29.120
 It's crazy.

1:32:29.120 --> 1:32:32.680
 So what BOA initially had,

1:32:32.680 --> 1:32:37.160
 and I became the United States salesperson for BOA,

1:32:37.160 --> 1:32:38.240
 but what he had was,

1:32:38.240 --> 1:32:42.440
 is he was the first dumps provider in the United States.

1:32:42.440 --> 1:32:44.640
 So on the back of your credit or debit card,

1:32:44.640 --> 1:32:47.120
 there's a magnetic stripe.

1:32:47.120 --> 1:32:48.440
 Three data tracks on the stripe.

1:32:48.440 --> 1:32:50.400
 There was the first data track is the customer's name.

1:32:50.400 --> 1:32:52.640
 Second data track is the card number,

1:32:52.640 --> 1:32:56.080
 forward slash 16 digit algorithm outside of that.

1:32:56.080 --> 1:32:56.920
 That's important.

1:32:56.920 --> 1:32:58.560
 We'll get back to that in a few minutes.

1:32:58.560 --> 1:33:00.560
 Third data track is called indiscriminate data.

1:33:00.560 --> 1:33:02.600
 No one uses it, all right?

1:33:02.600 --> 1:33:05.760
 So what's bought and sold is the second data track.

1:33:05.760 --> 1:33:06.920
 It's called the dump.

1:33:06.920 --> 1:33:10.120
 And the reason that's sold is when you go into a shop,

1:33:10.120 --> 1:33:12.840
 you insert the card or you swipe the card,

1:33:12.840 --> 1:33:15.320
 the only information that's sent out for verification

1:33:15.320 --> 1:33:17.280
 is the second data track, all right?

1:33:17.280 --> 1:33:19.760
 That goes to the processor bank for verification.

1:33:19.760 --> 1:33:21.640
 The first data track, that customer's name,

1:33:21.640 --> 1:33:24.640
 shows up on the screen of the cashier in front of you.

1:33:24.640 --> 1:33:26.400
 So what typically happens is,

1:33:26.400 --> 1:33:28.200
 is you buy 10 of these dumps.

1:33:28.200 --> 1:33:30.560
 You get 10 counterfeit cards

1:33:30.560 --> 1:33:32.440
 in code track two on all 10 cards.

1:33:32.440 --> 1:33:35.320
 Track one, you create one fake driver's license.

1:33:35.320 --> 1:33:36.680
 Track one is just the name

1:33:36.680 --> 1:33:38.200
 of that one fake driver's license.

1:33:38.200 --> 1:33:40.280
 That way, when you go in the shop, swipe the card,

1:33:40.280 --> 1:33:42.120
 track two gets sent off for verification.

1:33:42.120 --> 1:33:44.920
 Track one shows up on the screen in front of the cashier.

1:33:44.920 --> 1:33:47.600
 If you ever ask for ID, you pull out the fake ID.

1:33:47.600 --> 1:33:48.880
 Everyone's a nice, warm, fuzzy.

1:33:48.880 --> 1:33:51.240
 You walk out with the cameras, Rolex.

1:33:51.240 --> 1:33:54.120
 And track one could be, it doesn't have to be connected.

1:33:54.120 --> 1:33:55.120
 It's not connected to track two.

1:33:55.120 --> 1:33:57.320
 Not connected at all, all right?

1:33:57.320 --> 1:33:59.880
 That's one of the big problems, all right?

1:33:59.880 --> 1:34:04.880
 So Scrip brought a host of technical people

1:34:05.560 --> 1:34:07.000
 into that type of environment,

1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:08.520
 all committing credit card theft.

1:34:08.520 --> 1:34:10.200
 We had proxy providers.

1:34:10.200 --> 1:34:13.080
 We had all these people that were doing this stuff.

1:34:13.080 --> 1:34:15.560
 We start making a lot of money, a lot.

1:34:15.560 --> 1:34:17.680
 And the reason that happens is, again,

1:34:17.680 --> 1:34:21.160
 Scrip did not have the ability to cash out.

1:34:21.160 --> 1:34:23.600
 So he was reduced to selling things.

1:34:23.600 --> 1:34:25.160
 And at the same time, he's looking for,

1:34:25.160 --> 1:34:27.160
 how do I make more money, all right?

1:34:28.120 --> 1:34:31.520
 The Ukrainians happened upon this thing

1:34:31.520 --> 1:34:34.440
 called the CVV1 breach, or hack,

1:34:34.440 --> 1:34:36.120
 is what they called it.

1:34:36.120 --> 1:34:39.120
 So what happens is, remember I told you track two,

1:34:39.120 --> 1:34:43.440
 card number forward slash 16 digit algorithm.

1:34:43.440 --> 1:34:46.320
 You gotta know the algorithm to encode it

1:34:46.320 --> 1:34:49.360
 so you can swipe the card or take it to the ATM machine.

1:34:49.360 --> 1:34:50.360
 All right, ATM.

1:34:51.800 --> 1:34:52.800
 You gotta know it.

1:34:52.800 --> 1:34:54.840
 Now we were fishing data from hell.

1:34:54.840 --> 1:34:58.600
 I mean, we were doing a lot of fishing, a lot.

1:34:58.600 --> 1:35:01.360
 We were getting pins, we were getting card numbers,

1:35:01.360 --> 1:35:03.680
 but you can't get that algorithm.

1:35:03.680 --> 1:35:07.000
 So Ukrainians start testing stuff.

1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:10.240
 What they found out was no bank

1:35:10.240 --> 1:35:13.640
 had implemented the hash on track two.

1:35:13.640 --> 1:35:17.600
 So you take the card number forward slash any 16 digits,

1:35:17.600 --> 1:35:19.360
 it would encode.

1:35:19.360 --> 1:35:21.840
 Take it to the ATM, pull cash out,

1:35:21.840 --> 1:35:24.280
 because you got the pin, all right?

1:35:24.280 --> 1:35:26.320
 Started doing that.

1:35:26.320 --> 1:35:28.680
 Well, wait, sorry, I'm trying to understand.

1:35:28.680 --> 1:35:32.960
 So that means, so if there's no hash,

1:35:32.960 --> 1:35:34.680
 are they generating random numbers

1:35:34.680 --> 1:35:37.120
 or do they have valid numbers for track two?

1:35:37.120 --> 1:35:38.320
 No numbers needed at all,

1:35:38.320 --> 1:35:41.840
 as long as just the track two was a complete track two.

1:35:41.840 --> 1:35:45.680
 So it's a valid track two that doesn't match,

1:35:45.680 --> 1:35:48.560
 so the pin is the thing that gets you in?

1:35:48.560 --> 1:35:50.240
 So back then, all right, back then,

1:35:50.240 --> 1:35:52.120
 what we're talking about is you needed,

1:35:52.120 --> 1:35:54.320
 typically today you need a whole track two.

1:35:54.320 --> 1:35:55.800
 You need that valid track two.

1:35:55.800 --> 1:35:59.040
 All right, you need the 16 digit card number,

1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:01.320
 forward slash, and then whatever that algorithm

1:36:01.320 --> 1:36:03.160
 does, the other side of it, all right?

1:36:03.160 --> 1:36:06.760
 Back then, none of the banks had implemented that algorithm.

1:36:06.760 --> 1:36:08.920
 So while the algorithm was there,

1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:11.360
 you didn't need it to encode.

1:36:13.640 --> 1:36:14.480
 Interesting.

1:36:14.480 --> 1:36:15.920
 Interesting.

1:36:15.920 --> 1:36:20.920
 So you can make a lot of money with physical of fake.

1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:24.000
 So much money that card not present fraud.

1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:25.520
 Card not present fraud, remember I told you,

1:36:25.520 --> 1:36:28.320
 was $30,000 to $40,000 a month, all right?

1:36:28.320 --> 1:36:32.560
 That turned into $30,000 to $40,000 a day.

1:36:32.560 --> 1:36:35.560
 The Ukrainians, again, they can't cash it out.

1:36:36.800 --> 1:36:38.240
 They've got all the data on the planet,

1:36:38.240 --> 1:36:39.240
 but they can't cash it out,

1:36:39.240 --> 1:36:41.400
 those three necessities of cybercrime.

1:36:41.400 --> 1:36:44.600
 So the deal became, you have to rely on the Americans.

1:36:44.600 --> 1:36:46.600
 Tell you what, we'll give you 40%.

1:36:46.600 --> 1:36:48.080
 So you had all these cashiers

1:36:48.080 --> 1:36:51.160
 that were 40% of $40,000 a day.

1:36:51.160 --> 1:36:53.360
 Yeah, we'll take that, all right?

1:36:53.360 --> 1:36:55.560
 Send the rest of it over to buy Western Union

1:36:55.560 --> 1:36:57.880
 or what have you to your Ukrainian contact.

1:36:57.880 --> 1:36:59.720
 That's before cryptocurrency came into play.

1:36:59.720 --> 1:37:01.000
 Now you had a couple of forerunners

1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:04.320
 with eGold and Liberty Reserve, things like that.

1:37:04.320 --> 1:37:07.680
 But back then it starts out with Western Union,

1:37:07.680 --> 1:37:09.360
 then it becomes prepaid cards,

1:37:09.360 --> 1:37:11.120
 sending track information over,

1:37:11.120 --> 1:37:12.440
 loading the card up like that,

1:37:12.440 --> 1:37:14.480
 and then finally you get to eGold, Liberty Reserve,

1:37:14.480 --> 1:37:17.320
 and then today it's with crypto that's used.

1:37:19.840 --> 1:37:23.240
 Started stealing a lot of money, a lot.

1:37:23.240 --> 1:37:26.560
 And that got law enforcement attention.

1:37:26.560 --> 1:37:30.400
 So we started to see, I mean, it's a crazy ass story.

1:37:30.400 --> 1:37:33.600
 We started to see IPs coming in

1:37:33.600 --> 1:37:35.640
 from law enforcement agencies, government agencies,

1:37:35.640 --> 1:37:36.760
 because back then they didn't know

1:37:36.760 --> 1:37:38.280
 how to shield their identity either.

1:37:38.280 --> 1:37:42.080
 So you saw Secret Service, you saw DoD,

1:37:42.080 --> 1:37:44.520
 you saw all these like, and you're like,

1:37:44.520 --> 1:37:45.480
 that's interesting.

1:37:45.480 --> 1:37:49.280
 So, you know, and at the same time,

1:37:51.440 --> 1:37:54.120
 it was called a hack, but it wasn't a hack.

1:37:54.120 --> 1:37:58.840
 We had a guy that worked at T Mobile in Los Angeles.

1:37:58.840 --> 1:38:01.240
 This is the same guy that back then

1:38:01.240 --> 1:38:04.640
 published Paris Hilton's phone contact list.

1:38:04.640 --> 1:38:06.080
 That made a lot of news.

1:38:07.200 --> 1:38:09.800
 Not only did he do that, but it turned out

1:38:09.800 --> 1:38:12.440
 that the Los Angeles Secret Service Agency

1:38:12.440 --> 1:38:14.240
 was using T Mobile phones.

1:38:14.240 --> 1:38:17.960
 So he's getting text messages of the Secret Service

1:38:17.960 --> 1:38:19.960
 investigating Shadow Crew,

1:38:19.960 --> 1:38:21.840
 and he posts those damn things on Shadow Crew.

1:38:21.840 --> 1:38:23.920
 So I'm sitting there going, head of the pile,

1:38:23.920 --> 1:38:27.040
 I'm sitting there going, this is not gonna end well.

1:38:27.040 --> 1:38:28.600
 This is not gonna end well.

1:38:28.600 --> 1:38:31.400
 So at the same time, I had access,

1:38:31.400 --> 1:38:33.080
 I started out with access

1:38:33.080 --> 1:38:35.720
 to the Indiana State Sex Offenders Registry,

1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:37.880
 and I was using that to create bank accounts,

1:38:37.880 --> 1:38:39.720
 launder the money out, and I would sell the bank accounts,

1:38:39.720 --> 1:38:40.560
 stuff like that.

1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:43.160
 They shut that down.

1:38:43.160 --> 1:38:44.960
 The next database I had access to

1:38:44.960 --> 1:38:47.640
 was the Texas Driver's License database,

1:38:47.640 --> 1:38:51.080
 and started using that to create fake driver's licenses,

1:38:51.080 --> 1:38:52.120
 what have you.

1:38:52.120 --> 1:38:54.440
 And then finally, we happened upon

1:38:54.440 --> 1:38:57.840
 the California Death Index, all right?

1:38:58.840 --> 1:39:00.800
 Complete information, mother's maiden,

1:39:00.800 --> 1:39:04.680
 socials, DOBs, all that, and it's like,

1:39:04.680 --> 1:39:06.280
 gotta be a use for that.

1:39:06.280 --> 1:39:09.680
 Well, you can use it to create identities all day long.

1:39:09.680 --> 1:39:14.680
 My idea was, I wonder if you could take somebody

1:39:14.840 --> 1:39:18.480
 that's died and then file for social security death benefit,

1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:20.360
 not death benefits, but social security benefits

1:39:20.360 --> 1:39:23.200
 for that individual, and get that recurring paycheck in.

1:39:23.200 --> 1:39:24.680
 So that takes a lot of research

1:39:24.680 --> 1:39:26.760
 to start seeing if you can do that.

1:39:26.760 --> 1:39:29.440
 How does the federal government know if you're dead?

1:39:29.440 --> 1:39:32.680
 Do federal indexes reference state indexes?

1:39:32.680 --> 1:39:34.920
 You got all these questions that pop up.

1:39:34.920 --> 1:39:36.760
 Well, it turns out, federal indexes

1:39:36.760 --> 1:39:39.760
 don't reference state indexes, it's against the law.

1:39:39.760 --> 1:39:42.200
 It also turns out, the only way the federal government

1:39:42.200 --> 1:39:46.120
 knows you're dead is prior to 1998,

1:39:46.120 --> 1:39:51.000
 the family had to file a social security death benefit

1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:53.800
 for that person, all right?

1:39:53.800 --> 1:39:54.640
 Prior to 98.

1:39:54.640 --> 1:39:56.040
 Which of course most people don't.

1:39:56.040 --> 1:39:58.560
 Right, prior to 98, it took the family.

1:39:58.560 --> 1:40:01.200
 After 98, the hospital can do it,

1:40:01.200 --> 1:40:03.560
 funeral home can do it, or the family can do it.

1:40:03.560 --> 1:40:05.840
 So a lot more people have it filed after,

1:40:05.840 --> 1:40:06.680
 if they've died after.

1:40:06.680 --> 1:40:08.320
 But it's still, there's a lot of people

1:40:08.320 --> 1:40:09.840
 who probably don't. A lot of people don't.

1:40:09.840 --> 1:40:13.960
 Because that death benefit's only like $219, okay?

1:40:13.960 --> 1:40:15.960
 Nobody's thinking about that shit.

1:40:15.960 --> 1:40:19.840
 So I started to apply for social security benefits.

1:40:19.840 --> 1:40:21.760
 Nope, number's dormant.

1:40:21.760 --> 1:40:23.760
 So they want you to come in for a physical interview.

1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:26.480
 Here I am, you know, 32.

1:40:26.480 --> 1:40:29.600
 You're not gonna pass as a 65 year old, so no.

1:40:29.600 --> 1:40:31.580
 So the next idea I had was,

1:40:32.920 --> 1:40:34.800
 I wonder if you could file income tax returns

1:40:34.800 --> 1:40:35.640
 on these people.

1:40:37.080 --> 1:40:40.400
 Turns out you can, all day long.

1:40:40.400 --> 1:40:42.120
 So I started doing that.

1:40:42.120 --> 1:40:45.080
 And I started to steal, once I got ramped up,

1:40:45.080 --> 1:40:46.280
 because you test everything.

1:40:46.280 --> 1:40:47.720
 You know, you're testing to make sure,

1:40:47.720 --> 1:40:50.400
 you gotta figure out what the deposit instrument is

1:40:50.400 --> 1:40:51.240
 and everything else.

1:40:51.240 --> 1:40:53.240
 And once you get all that lined out,

1:40:53.240 --> 1:40:55.960
 I started to steal $160,000 a week,

1:40:55.960 --> 1:40:58.520
 every week for 10 months out of the year.

1:40:58.520 --> 1:41:00.800
 By paying taxes?

1:41:00.800 --> 1:41:03.120
 By filing fake returns.

1:41:03.120 --> 1:41:05.120
 Yeah, filing fake tax returns.

1:41:05.120 --> 1:41:07.680
 So you find a business, and the way the system worked

1:41:07.680 --> 1:41:11.760
 is the IRS will issue a refund on somebody

1:41:11.760 --> 1:41:13.120
 before they're able to verify

1:41:13.120 --> 1:41:15.360
 that that person worked for an employer.

1:41:15.360 --> 1:41:17.440
 Still works like that today.

1:41:17.440 --> 1:41:18.440
 All right, so.

1:41:18.440 --> 1:41:20.560
 And you're keeping the amounts relatively low.

1:41:20.560 --> 1:41:22.600
 Keep them at $3,000.

1:41:22.600 --> 1:41:23.440
 All right.

1:41:23.440 --> 1:41:24.280
 Amounts are very low.

1:41:24.280 --> 1:41:25.680
 But you're still able to achieve scale

1:41:25.680 --> 1:41:27.200
 because this large index of real people.

1:41:27.200 --> 1:41:28.920
 I got to where, and I was manual.

1:41:28.920 --> 1:41:30.280
 Later on, a couple buddies of mine

1:41:30.280 --> 1:41:31.520
 went automated with it.

1:41:31.520 --> 1:41:32.960
 Wait, you were doing this by hand?

1:41:32.960 --> 1:41:34.760
 So there's no code involved?

1:41:34.760 --> 1:41:35.720
 All manual.

1:41:35.720 --> 1:41:36.560
 Wow.

1:41:36.560 --> 1:41:38.240
 I'd file a return once every six minutes.

1:41:39.280 --> 1:41:42.120
 Work 10 hours a day, three days a week.

1:41:42.120 --> 1:41:44.680
 So clicking on, so typing fast and clicking.

1:41:44.680 --> 1:41:46.560
 One return every six minutes.

1:41:46.560 --> 1:41:47.880
 That's changing IP.

1:41:47.880 --> 1:41:49.320
 That's changing address.

1:41:49.320 --> 1:41:51.640
 Everything else, one return every six minutes.

1:41:52.680 --> 1:41:54.040
 For three days a week.

1:41:54.040 --> 1:41:57.040
 Fourth day, I would take a road trip,

1:41:57.040 --> 1:41:59.280
 plot out a map of ATMs.

1:41:59.280 --> 1:42:01.520
 And then the next two days, cash out.

1:42:01.520 --> 1:42:02.880
 Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

1:42:02.880 --> 1:42:03.720
 All right.

1:42:03.720 --> 1:42:05.200
 Come back home, rinse and repeat.

1:42:06.240 --> 1:42:08.040
 Turns out that a backpack,

1:42:08.040 --> 1:42:09.320
 I don't see anybody sitting around here,

1:42:09.320 --> 1:42:12.960
 but a backpack will hold $150,000 of 20s,

1:42:12.960 --> 1:42:14.400
 is what it will hold.

1:42:14.400 --> 1:42:16.680
 So I'd put 150K and 20s in a backpack.

1:42:16.680 --> 1:42:18.240
 I had a spare bedroom.

1:42:18.240 --> 1:42:21.040
 I'd come in, toss the backpack in the bedroom.

1:42:21.040 --> 1:42:23.080
 This is very, very important information.

1:42:23.080 --> 1:42:25.360
 And the fact that you know it is also very,

1:42:25.360 --> 1:42:27.920
 first we started with the volume of coal that weighs a ton,

1:42:27.920 --> 1:42:32.280
 and now a backpack holds $150,000 of 20s.

1:42:32.280 --> 1:42:35.320
 And then you can multiply that by five 400s.

1:42:35.320 --> 1:42:36.240
 Yeah.

1:42:36.240 --> 1:42:37.080
 I like this.

1:42:37.080 --> 1:42:39.680
 It's also times 20s coming out of ATM, right?

1:42:39.680 --> 1:42:42.000
 Each 20 weighs a gram.

1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:43.840
 Each 20 weighs a gram.

1:42:43.840 --> 1:42:45.480
 So you can actually go by weight,

1:42:45.480 --> 1:42:47.320
 which is what federal authorities do

1:42:47.320 --> 1:42:49.920
 when they get a pallet of cash, they just weigh it.

1:42:49.920 --> 1:42:52.200
 Oh, they just, they just weigh it.

1:42:52.200 --> 1:42:55.720
 So 150K is seven and a half keys of cash.

1:42:55.720 --> 1:42:59.440
 One and a half, 15, oh, that's pretty light.

1:42:59.440 --> 1:43:00.280
 Not bad, not bad.

1:43:00.280 --> 1:43:02.080
 Yeah, you get a big backpack,

1:43:02.080 --> 1:43:05.120
 go do a good run with David Goggins with it.

1:43:05.120 --> 1:43:05.960
 I like it.

1:43:05.960 --> 1:43:08.560
 The fact that you know this is great.

1:43:08.560 --> 1:43:11.320
 So wait, where does that come in with the backpack?

1:43:11.320 --> 1:43:14.040
 So what happens is I didn't know how to launder money.

1:43:14.040 --> 1:43:17.280
 All right, so I'm throwing cash in the spare bedroom.

1:43:17.280 --> 1:43:20.320
 One day you open up the bedroom and you're like,

1:43:20.320 --> 1:43:22.120
 gotta do something with those backpacks.

1:43:22.120 --> 1:43:25.200
 And that's when you start learning how to launder money,

1:43:25.200 --> 1:43:26.880
 cash based businesses, things like that.

1:43:26.880 --> 1:43:28.040
 I had a production company,

1:43:28.040 --> 1:43:29.560
 had a couple of detailing company.

1:43:29.560 --> 1:43:31.900
 I was thinking about going into food trucks,

1:43:31.900 --> 1:43:33.080
 things like that in Charleston.

1:43:33.080 --> 1:43:35.240
 Actually, can you pause on that to take a tangent there?

1:43:35.240 --> 1:43:39.080
 How does money laundering work?

1:43:39.080 --> 1:43:42.240
 I mean, at that time and what years are we talking about?

1:43:42.240 --> 1:43:46.840
 This is, by the time the tax return schemes go into play,

1:43:46.840 --> 1:43:51.000
 we're talking 2002, 2003 is when tax returns start.

1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:54.920
 And so what, at that time and what you're aware of now,

1:43:54.920 --> 1:43:58.340
 how it evolved, how does money laundering work?

1:43:59.400 --> 1:44:00.640
 You know, it's not that much different.

1:44:00.640 --> 1:44:02.200
 It's really not.

1:44:02.200 --> 1:44:04.160
 You get a cash based business,

1:44:04.160 --> 1:44:06.160
 start laundering the money or putting the money through that,

1:44:06.160 --> 1:44:08.080
 saying the transactions are legal.

1:44:08.080 --> 1:44:11.160
 You then start depositing into bank accounts.

1:44:11.160 --> 1:44:14.520
 From bank accounts, my thing was is

1:44:15.880 --> 1:44:19.920
 have bank accounts in the United States, Mexico, Canada,

1:44:19.920 --> 1:44:22.400
 and then finally bounce over to Estonia

1:44:22.400 --> 1:44:24.040
 was the final destination of all this stuff.

1:44:24.040 --> 1:44:28.480
 And the idea is to try to move them to so many places

1:44:28.480 --> 1:44:31.200
 that by the end of the day, it looks legal

1:44:31.200 --> 1:44:34.480
 and you can't trace it all if you're ever caught,

1:44:34.480 --> 1:44:36.280
 which you ultimately are.

1:44:36.280 --> 1:44:38.400
 But so cash based businesses, you know.

1:44:38.400 --> 1:44:40.040
 So when you say, sorry to interrupt,

1:44:40.040 --> 1:44:41.800
 the cash based businesses,

1:44:41.800 --> 1:44:46.800
 so you have money that needs to be moved to other people.

1:44:48.680 --> 1:44:49.600
 So how does that work?

1:44:49.600 --> 1:44:50.880
 What's the business?

1:44:50.880 --> 1:44:52.640
 Are people providing you a service

1:44:52.640 --> 1:44:54.320
 and you're giving them money?

1:44:54.320 --> 1:44:57.440
 Right, so you do the Ozark thing if you wanna do that.

1:44:57.440 --> 1:44:59.640
 So you can gamble, cash out something like that.

1:44:59.640 --> 1:45:02.560
 So it trips to whatever casinos you've got.

1:45:02.560 --> 1:45:05.880
 You've got your production company or your detail company.

1:45:05.880 --> 1:45:08.080
 So how many cars are you cleaning a day?

1:45:08.080 --> 1:45:10.280
 How many companies have you got to do that?

1:45:10.280 --> 1:45:12.680
 All right, whatever that company is,

1:45:12.680 --> 1:45:13.760
 it's gotta be cash based.

1:45:13.760 --> 1:45:16.960
 Somebody's paying you in cash is what you're doing.

1:45:16.960 --> 1:45:19.040
 You have to have enough of those cash based businesses

1:45:19.040 --> 1:45:21.200
 where it doesn't look funny.

1:45:21.200 --> 1:45:23.160
 All right, because if you're a detail company

1:45:23.160 --> 1:45:26.000
 making $100,000 a month, that's a problem.

1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:30.320
 Okay, so then you start depositing into that.

1:45:30.320 --> 1:45:33.200
 Well, because of the Patriot Act,

1:45:33.200 --> 1:45:37.760
 a suspicious activity report, SARS, came in at $2,500

1:45:37.760 --> 1:45:40.360
 instead of the 10K that it used to be.

1:45:40.360 --> 1:45:42.240
 So all of a sudden you've got multiple bank accounts

1:45:42.240 --> 1:45:44.680
 that you've got to set up, all right?

1:45:44.680 --> 1:45:46.320
 Fortunately, what you also had

1:45:46.320 --> 1:45:47.960
 is you had a bunch of prepaid debit cards

1:45:47.960 --> 1:45:49.840
 that were coming into play at the same time.

1:45:49.840 --> 1:45:53.760
 So a combination of bank accounts, prepaid debits

1:45:53.760 --> 1:45:56.480
 that had ACH abilities attached to those as well,

1:45:56.480 --> 1:45:58.360
 and you start running them all together.

1:45:58.360 --> 1:46:00.240
 Then once it's out of the United States,

1:46:00.240 --> 1:46:01.320
 you don't have to worry as much.

1:46:01.320 --> 1:46:05.320
 You can start funneling that into fewer bank accounts

1:46:05.320 --> 1:46:07.640
 until finally you've got the one main account

1:46:07.640 --> 1:46:11.280
 that's over at Bank Letico in Estonia at that point.

1:46:11.280 --> 1:46:12.960
 That's what you've got.

1:46:12.960 --> 1:46:15.400
 So a bunch of hops that end up at a place

1:46:15.400 --> 1:46:16.360
 that you can't trace.

1:46:16.360 --> 1:46:19.840
 And to give you an idea, I was arrested February 8th, 2005.

1:46:19.840 --> 1:46:22.920
 My last seizure was 2010.

1:46:22.920 --> 1:46:24.320
 Got the last seizure notice.

1:46:24.320 --> 1:46:28.760
 So they got it, but it didn't took them that long

1:46:28.760 --> 1:46:30.320
 to get to it.

1:46:30.320 --> 1:46:34.400
 So how do stories like with Script that come into play here

1:46:34.400 --> 1:46:38.680
 where he had someone who owed him money

1:46:38.680 --> 1:46:40.080
 kidnapped and tortured.

1:46:40.080 --> 1:46:45.080
 So when does it turn darker?

1:46:45.160 --> 1:46:48.800
 It turns darker the more money you make.

1:46:48.800 --> 1:46:52.840
 Script was a kid that he was stealing enough money

1:46:52.840 --> 1:46:55.120
 that he was able to buy whatever estate he wanted to.

1:46:55.120 --> 1:46:58.000
 And he would brag about touring the countryside.

1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:00.960
 And if he saw property that he liked, he would buy it.

1:47:00.960 --> 1:47:03.880
 And that was not just a brag, he was doing that.

1:47:03.880 --> 1:47:05.800
 So this kid is stealing a lot of money.

1:47:05.800 --> 1:47:08.640
 At the same time, he's got connections politically

1:47:08.640 --> 1:47:10.960
 because of his family, he's got connections

1:47:10.960 --> 1:47:13.560
 and that family's got connections with a Ukrainian mob.

1:47:13.560 --> 1:47:16.240
 All right, so he's got these inroads

1:47:16.240 --> 1:47:17.760
 and people are looking out for him

1:47:17.760 --> 1:47:20.040
 and he's stealing a lot of money at the same time.

1:47:20.040 --> 1:47:24.400
 Somebody doesn't pay him a decent amount of money.

1:47:24.400 --> 1:47:25.400
 Somebody doesn't pay him.

1:47:25.400 --> 1:47:29.400
 Now we had never, with Shadow Crew, with Carter Planet,

1:47:29.400 --> 1:47:33.240
 with Counterfeit Library, we were basically the geeks.

1:47:33.240 --> 1:47:35.360
 All right, we were just the fraudsters,

1:47:35.360 --> 1:47:36.880
 the social engineers.

1:47:36.880 --> 1:47:38.880
 We had never really considered violence.

1:47:38.880 --> 1:47:40.560
 The rules that I had in play were,

1:47:40.560 --> 1:47:43.160
 hey, we don't do child pornography,

1:47:43.160 --> 1:47:46.800
 we don't do counterfeit currency, we don't do drugs.

1:47:46.800 --> 1:47:48.880
 And the only thing we ended up really obeying

1:47:48.880 --> 1:47:51.640
 was the child porn stuff, except for Max Butler,

1:47:51.640 --> 1:47:52.880
 who you mentioned earlier.

1:47:54.520 --> 1:47:57.240
 Script, someone rips the guy off.

1:47:57.240 --> 1:48:02.240
 And he comes online on Shadow Crew at that point

1:48:02.280 --> 1:48:04.320
 and he posts these pictures one day.

1:48:04.320 --> 1:48:07.280
 And I mean, it was a detailed narrative through the pictures.

1:48:07.280 --> 1:48:10.320
 Had the guy that rammed in the van,

1:48:10.320 --> 1:48:12.720
 he had the door open, rammed in the van,

1:48:12.720 --> 1:48:15.800
 had the guy tied up, had the guy being tortured.

1:48:15.800 --> 1:48:20.240
 And the response was, this is what happens

1:48:20.240 --> 1:48:22.480
 when you steal from me.

1:48:22.480 --> 1:48:27.480
 And that's the first time that violence came into play

1:48:27.800 --> 1:48:29.960
 at that point, and that's when things got,

1:48:29.960 --> 1:48:32.600
 you start realizing things are getting a little serious.

1:48:32.600 --> 1:48:34.680
 How did that make you feel?

1:48:34.680 --> 1:48:38.080
 The first response is, can't be real.

1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:42.040
 He's just doing that.

1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:44.160
 You know, he's wanting to send a message.

1:48:44.160 --> 1:48:48.360
 Then you're like, no, that's real, that's real.

1:48:49.960 --> 1:48:52.000
 Were you afraid in your own heart

1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:55.160
 that you might descend to that too?

1:48:55.160 --> 1:48:58.480
 Like if you see that, or was it pretty clear to you

1:48:58.480 --> 1:49:02.320
 that that's a line that some people can cross

1:49:02.320 --> 1:49:05.040
 and some can't and you're not one of those that can cross it?

1:49:05.040 --> 1:49:07.760
 You know, I gotta tell you, I joke with my wife.

1:49:10.040 --> 1:49:13.040
 The joke I tell my wife is, you know,

1:49:13.040 --> 1:49:15.960
 I knew some guy that had 8,000 Bitcoins.

1:49:15.960 --> 1:49:19.560
 I might be persuaded to ask him for access to that.

1:49:19.560 --> 1:49:20.400
 And she was like, how?

1:49:20.400 --> 1:49:23.440
 And I was like, well, hammer and toes.

1:49:23.440 --> 1:49:28.120
 And I say that as a joke,

1:49:28.120 --> 1:49:32.160
 but there's that line where you're like,

1:49:32.160 --> 1:49:34.200
 I remember who I used to be.

1:49:34.200 --> 1:49:37.080
 And if you're looking at that kind of money,

1:49:38.480 --> 1:49:41.560
 I might be persuaded to do that back then.

1:49:41.560 --> 1:49:46.560
 You know, that's, and I think that was Scripps issue

1:49:46.800 --> 1:49:49.160
 is it was a lot of money to him.

1:49:49.160 --> 1:49:50.000
 There's the money.

1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:53.240
 And then there's, you know, violence can also be gradual.

1:49:53.240 --> 1:49:54.840
 So over time you do a little more, a little more,

1:49:54.840 --> 1:49:56.840
 a little more, a little more.

1:49:56.840 --> 1:49:58.400
 You get used to what's going on

1:49:58.400 --> 1:49:59.680
 and then I get desensitized.

1:49:59.680 --> 1:50:02.880
 And you figure, you take somebody like Ross Ulbricht,

1:50:02.880 --> 1:50:04.880
 the Silk Road guy, all right.

1:50:05.880 --> 1:50:08.040
 Ross was not a violent guy.

1:50:08.040 --> 1:50:08.960
 He was not.

1:50:08.960 --> 1:50:10.240
 But at that point in time, you know,

1:50:10.240 --> 1:50:13.120
 he was sitting on 24 million in Bitcoin.

1:50:13.120 --> 1:50:15.120
 He was the only game in town.

1:50:15.120 --> 1:50:17.200
 And that 24 now is like, I don't know,

1:50:17.200 --> 1:50:20.440
 22, 24 billion, some crap like that.

1:50:20.440 --> 1:50:24.960
 But he felt in danger.

1:50:27.080 --> 1:50:28.640
 This guy was gonna turn him in.

1:50:28.640 --> 1:50:29.920
 You know, it was a black mountain and everything.

1:50:29.920 --> 1:50:34.800
 So Ross thinks he hires a couple hit men to kill the guy.

1:50:34.800 --> 1:50:36.680
 So it becomes that thing.

1:50:36.680 --> 1:50:38.520
 And I saw that over and over again.

1:50:38.520 --> 1:50:41.240
 And I'd like to say I wasn't like that,

1:50:41.240 --> 1:50:43.920
 but given the same circumstances,

1:50:43.920 --> 1:50:46.280
 I would have probably done the same thing.

1:50:46.280 --> 1:50:49.040
 And also when you're, it's not just about money,

1:50:49.040 --> 1:50:50.200
 there's a lot of other forces.

1:50:50.200 --> 1:50:54.400
 Like if you're threatened for your wellbeing

1:50:54.400 --> 1:50:56.240
 or for your wealth or for your power,

1:50:56.240 --> 1:50:59.240
 all of us operate under different motivations.

1:50:59.240 --> 1:51:02.560
 Plus that online aspect with those communities like that,

1:51:02.560 --> 1:51:03.920
 if you're the head guy,

1:51:03.920 --> 1:51:06.320
 you really feel like you're the parent of these guys.

1:51:06.320 --> 1:51:07.840
 So somebody is starting to threaten them,

1:51:07.840 --> 1:51:10.360
 it's like, all right, what do I need to do?

1:51:10.360 --> 1:51:12.000
 So what do you make of Silk Road?

1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:16.400
 The Shadow Crew started something that today

1:51:16.400 --> 1:51:19.520
 you can call dark net and dark net markets.

1:51:19.520 --> 1:51:22.280
 So these markets that operate, that trade,

1:51:23.600 --> 1:51:28.600
 trade things, everything from child pornography to drugs,

1:51:28.600 --> 1:51:30.800
 to, I mean, what else?

1:51:31.680 --> 1:51:32.520
 Everywhere.

1:51:32.520 --> 1:51:34.640
 What are the dark things that humans want to do

1:51:34.640 --> 1:51:36.640
 that they don't want anyone to know about?

1:51:36.640 --> 1:51:37.920
 All of those things.

1:51:39.920 --> 1:51:44.040
 So can you maybe tell me, you know what?

1:51:44.040 --> 1:51:45.160
 Let's just even step back.

1:51:45.160 --> 1:51:46.200
 What is the dark net?

1:51:46.200 --> 1:51:47.600
 How big is it?

1:51:47.600 --> 1:51:48.920
 What happens there?

1:51:48.920 --> 1:51:51.960
 Let's backtrack a little bit more before we get to that.

1:51:51.960 --> 1:51:55.560
 All right, what Shadow Crew did,

1:51:56.720 --> 1:52:01.720
 other than dealing in all these stolen wares,

1:52:01.720 --> 1:52:04.960
 what Shadow Crew did that's really important.

1:52:04.960 --> 1:52:08.000
 Remember those three necessities that I talked about?

1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:09.520
 But the important thing is,

1:52:09.520 --> 1:52:13.200
 is it established trust among criminals, all right?

1:52:13.200 --> 1:52:14.360
 Because that's a necessity.

1:52:14.360 --> 1:52:17.440
 You have to be able to trust who you're dealing with

1:52:17.440 --> 1:52:19.320
 because you have to deal with somebody.

1:52:19.320 --> 1:52:21.240
 You have to, all right?

1:52:21.240 --> 1:52:23.480
 So how do you know you're not dealing with a cop?

1:52:23.480 --> 1:52:24.320
 How do you know you're dealing

1:52:24.320 --> 1:52:25.520
 with somebody that's skilled?

1:52:25.520 --> 1:52:26.640
 How do you know you're going to deal with somebody

1:52:26.640 --> 1:52:27.960
 that's not going to rip you off?

1:52:27.960 --> 1:52:30.040
 You have to be able to trust that individual.

1:52:30.040 --> 1:52:31.160
 The Shadow Crew provided

1:52:31.160 --> 1:52:33.000
 that trust mechanism for criminals.

1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:35.840
 You had that communication channel, the forums,

1:52:35.840 --> 1:52:38.880
 where you could reference conversations weeks, months old,

1:52:38.880 --> 1:52:41.320
 take part and learn from those conversations.

1:52:41.320 --> 1:52:44.080
 You had vouching systems and review systems in place,

1:52:44.080 --> 1:52:46.080
 escrow systems in place.

1:52:46.080 --> 1:52:49.720
 You knew by looking at someone's screen name,

1:52:49.720 --> 1:52:51.520
 if you could trust the individual,

1:52:51.520 --> 1:52:53.320
 network with the individual, all right?

1:52:53.320 --> 1:52:57.560
 And that community of just humans

1:52:57.560 --> 1:53:01.240
 provided that backbone of trust.

1:53:01.240 --> 1:53:04.080
 And that's really interesting when you think about it.

1:53:04.080 --> 1:53:05.520
 You had the trust that was there,

1:53:05.520 --> 1:53:06.600
 but you also had this,

1:53:08.400 --> 1:53:11.360
 almost this instantaneous information

1:53:11.360 --> 1:53:13.640
 that was available about the community

1:53:13.640 --> 1:53:15.440
 or about cyber crime at large.

1:53:15.440 --> 1:53:18.080
 And that's still in play today, all right?

1:53:18.080 --> 1:53:21.440
 So that was the way things were

1:53:21.440 --> 1:53:23.160
 until a couple of things happened.

1:53:23.160 --> 1:53:25.640
 And one was cryptocurrency.

1:53:25.640 --> 1:53:29.000
 The other one was the Tor browser, the dark web.

1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:30.920
 Now I was working with a secret service,

1:53:30.920 --> 1:53:32.840
 ripping the secret service off,

1:53:32.840 --> 1:53:34.840
 when Tor comes into play, all right?

1:53:34.840 --> 1:53:37.080
 So we got a memo in one day

1:53:37.080 --> 1:53:38.840
 and it was talking about the Tor browser.

1:53:38.840 --> 1:53:41.840
 And it was like, we really need to be careful with this.

1:53:41.840 --> 1:53:43.240
 This is going to be problem.

1:53:43.240 --> 1:53:45.640
 And so we all fired up the Tor browser

1:53:45.640 --> 1:53:50.480
 and it turns out it was, this was 2005, early six.

1:53:50.480 --> 1:53:52.160
 It turns out it was completely unusable,

1:53:52.160 --> 1:53:53.200
 could not use it at all,

1:53:53.200 --> 1:53:55.080
 simply because no one was using it

1:53:55.080 --> 1:53:56.440
 and it was extremely slow.

1:53:56.440 --> 1:53:58.240
 So for people who don't know,

1:53:58.240 --> 1:54:01.440
 Tor browser is a way to be completely anonymous.

1:54:01.440 --> 1:54:04.920
 As long as you properly know how to use it, huge caveat.

1:54:04.920 --> 1:54:07.840
 All right, so developed by the United States Navy

1:54:07.840 --> 1:54:08.680
 and they developed it.

1:54:08.680 --> 1:54:10.040
 I don't know this.

1:54:10.040 --> 1:54:10.880
 Oh yeah.

1:54:10.880 --> 1:54:13.280
 It wasn't the hackers that, interesting.

1:54:13.280 --> 1:54:17.280
 US Navy, to this day, the number one funder of Tor,

1:54:17.280 --> 1:54:20.400
 military, to this day, all right?

1:54:20.400 --> 1:54:21.240
 Interesting.

1:54:21.240 --> 1:54:22.440
 I mean, the same, I guess with the internet,

1:54:22.440 --> 1:54:25.080
 the origins are the dark web and DOD.

1:54:25.080 --> 1:54:28.400
 It was developed so that operatives could communicate

1:54:28.400 --> 1:54:31.360
 with each other without being identified, all right?

1:54:31.360 --> 1:54:33.160
 That then goes open source.

1:54:33.160 --> 1:54:35.200
 They release it, EFF comes in,

1:54:35.200 --> 1:54:38.320
 start sponsoring and everything else like that.

1:54:38.320 --> 1:54:40.160
 The next idea was, well, you know,

1:54:40.160 --> 1:54:42.520
 people can get around their country's firewalls,

1:54:42.520 --> 1:54:44.160
 whistleblowers can use it, things like that.

1:54:44.160 --> 1:54:45.800
 Well, someone forgot to mention

1:54:45.800 --> 1:54:48.000
 that the first adoptees of tech,

1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:50.960
 if you can use it to launder money or remain anonymous,

1:54:50.960 --> 1:54:52.880
 are criminals.

1:54:52.880 --> 1:54:55.320
 And so criminals start to use the damn thing.

1:54:55.320 --> 1:54:56.680
 All right?

1:54:56.680 --> 1:54:59.080
 So along the same time we get,

1:54:59.080 --> 1:55:00.040
 well, a few years later,

1:55:00.040 --> 1:55:02.560
 we get Satoshi Nakamoto pops up

1:55:02.560 --> 1:55:05.240
 with his ideas for Bitcoin,

1:55:05.240 --> 1:55:07.640
 and then Ross Ulbrich runs with it.

1:55:07.640 --> 1:55:10.160
 Ross Ulbrich decides he's gonna start up Silk Road.

1:55:10.160 --> 1:55:13.080
 So initially the people who were using Tor,

1:55:13.080 --> 1:55:15.120
 which later is the dark web,

1:55:15.120 --> 1:55:18.600
 people were using Tor or just talking with each other,

1:55:18.600 --> 1:55:21.560
 visiting websites, communicating like that.

1:55:21.560 --> 1:55:22.400
 Someone figured out,

1:55:22.400 --> 1:55:25.920
 hey man, we could host websites on this thing,

1:55:25.920 --> 1:55:28.960
 and they have a lot of trouble finding the box.

1:55:28.960 --> 1:55:33.680
 So that is the advent of Silk Road all of a sudden.

1:55:33.680 --> 1:55:35.120
 Ross Ulbrich has this idea

1:55:35.120 --> 1:55:36.720
 that he's gonna change the world

1:55:37.760 --> 1:55:40.960
 by becoming the largest drug dealer on the planet.

1:55:40.960 --> 1:55:42.600
 So he opens up the Silk Road

1:55:42.600 --> 1:55:46.520
 and the only payment instrument he allows is Bitcoin.

1:55:46.520 --> 1:55:48.640
 So if those people out there are wondering

1:55:48.640 --> 1:55:51.800
 why Bitcoin is going at what, 44K today?

1:55:51.800 --> 1:55:54.120
 Yeah, and by the time this is out,

1:55:54.120 --> 1:55:56.240
 it could be 100,000 or 10,000.

1:55:56.240 --> 1:55:57.080
 Absolutely.

1:55:57.080 --> 1:55:57.920
 We'll see.

1:55:57.920 --> 1:55:58.760
 Who knows?

1:55:58.760 --> 1:56:01.520
 If it's 10,000, I'm going to buy some.

1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:06.040
 Which is a hilarious statement to make

1:56:06.040 --> 1:56:09.200
 because that statement would be ridiculously wrong

1:56:09.200 --> 1:56:10.560
 like five years ago, right?

1:56:10.560 --> 1:56:12.680
 I know, I know, I know.

1:56:12.680 --> 1:56:14.560
 People 100 years from now will be laughing,

1:56:14.560 --> 1:56:18.480
 wait, it was that low back then?

1:56:18.480 --> 1:56:20.080
 So he only accepts Bitcoin,

1:56:20.080 --> 1:56:23.960
 and of course the initial use case of crypto

1:56:23.960 --> 1:56:26.600
 is no one wants to admit it today,

1:56:26.600 --> 1:56:29.880
 but the initial use case is we're gonna buy a bunch of pot.

1:56:29.880 --> 1:56:33.600
 We need somebody, we need a way to pay for it.

1:56:33.600 --> 1:56:35.520
 So that's what happens.

1:56:35.520 --> 1:56:38.680
 Ross, it's really interesting to me.

1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:43.240
 If you look at motivations of cyber criminals,

1:56:43.240 --> 1:56:48.040
 the motivations are status, cash, ideology, all right?

1:56:48.040 --> 1:56:51.400
 My guys, all cash, across the board, all cash.

1:56:52.280 --> 1:56:54.640
 Ross is ideology.

1:56:54.640 --> 1:56:57.080
 He really believed he was gonna change the world.

1:56:57.080 --> 1:56:57.920
 He really didn't.

1:56:57.920 --> 1:56:59.280
 I've been fortunate.

1:56:59.280 --> 1:57:03.680
 I actually know the guy who ran Silk Road 2

1:57:03.680 --> 1:57:07.000
 and have talked to the kid, everything else,

1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:10.040
 and I will tell you that those guys

1:57:10.040 --> 1:57:13.040
 who are motivated by ideology,

1:57:13.960 --> 1:57:16.080
 they are a completely different breed.

1:57:16.080 --> 1:57:17.080
 They really are.

1:57:17.080 --> 1:57:21.640
 It's not, you know, the cash guy, it's low hanging fruit.

1:57:21.640 --> 1:57:26.320
 The ease of, it's hard to stop committing crime,

1:57:26.320 --> 1:57:29.400
 but it's much easier for a cash motivated individual

1:57:29.400 --> 1:57:32.520
 to stop than it is that ideology guy.

1:57:32.520 --> 1:57:35.080
 That Silk Road 2 guy, he's still got it.

1:57:35.080 --> 1:57:36.520
 You know, he's not breaking the law,

1:57:36.520 --> 1:57:41.360
 but you can see it's like, he wants to, he wants to.

1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:42.680
 So it's...

1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:45.760
 That's fascinating that, I mean,

1:57:45.760 --> 1:57:47.680
 the worst atrocities in human history

1:57:47.680 --> 1:57:51.160
 are committed with people that operate under ideology.

1:57:51.160 --> 1:57:53.160
 All the other motivations are much weaker.

1:57:53.160 --> 1:57:54.920
 But you know, you think about it,

1:57:54.920 --> 1:57:59.640
 with Ross, I mean, very bright guy, very bright guy,

1:57:59.640 --> 1:58:02.320
 but think about the amount of cognitive dissonance

1:58:02.320 --> 1:58:04.160
 that the guy's got,

1:58:04.160 --> 1:58:06.640
 that he thinks he's gonna change the world

1:58:06.640 --> 1:58:08.320
 by running a drug site.

1:58:09.640 --> 1:58:12.720
 I mean, certainly, I mean, could he have changed the world?

1:58:12.720 --> 1:58:15.880
 Yeah, could he have done it like that?

1:58:15.880 --> 1:58:17.320
 Probably not.

1:58:17.320 --> 1:58:19.480
 Well, I can steel man those arguments.

1:58:19.480 --> 1:58:22.320
 I listened to quite a few libertarians

1:58:22.320 --> 1:58:24.120
 and you can push that to anarchists.

1:58:25.760 --> 1:58:28.880
 You know, there's a lot of people that argue...

1:58:28.880 --> 1:58:32.800
 So I actually talked to a professor at Columbia

1:58:32.800 --> 1:58:35.160
 who actually argues that all drugs should be legalized

1:58:35.160 --> 1:58:37.440
 and not at a philosophical level, political level,

1:58:37.440 --> 1:58:41.320
 but the fact that all the negative consequences of drugs

1:58:41.320 --> 1:58:44.640
 that people talk about actually have to do

1:58:44.640 --> 1:58:47.160
 with other factors in your life.

1:58:47.160 --> 1:58:48.240
 I would agree with that.

1:58:48.240 --> 1:58:51.600
 And so that's, okay, but that's more like a argument

1:58:51.600 --> 1:58:53.640
 about negative aspects of drugs.

1:58:53.640 --> 1:58:56.400
 I think the ideology comes in where it's like,

1:58:56.400 --> 1:58:59.280
 well, nobody should tell you what to do.

1:58:59.280 --> 1:59:02.960
 You should have the responsibility of your own actions.

1:59:02.960 --> 1:59:07.840
 Like the government or any other institution

1:59:07.840 --> 1:59:12.320
 shouldn't be the rule setters,

1:59:12.320 --> 1:59:14.560
 the constraints for how you live your life.

1:59:14.560 --> 1:59:17.160
 And so I could see that argument being made

1:59:17.160 --> 1:59:22.160
 and ultimately if you like create an open market for drugs,

1:59:22.680 --> 1:59:24.600
 how that could build a better society,

1:59:24.600 --> 1:59:28.160
 it might break down the outdated, the corrupt,

1:59:28.160 --> 1:59:29.600
 the bureaucratic institutions.

1:59:29.600 --> 1:59:31.880
 I mean, you can make that argument.

1:59:31.880 --> 1:59:33.640
 There's an argument and let's be fair.

1:59:33.640 --> 1:59:34.560
 I wanna be fair with it.

1:59:34.560 --> 1:59:38.160
 I mean, did he change the world?

1:59:38.160 --> 1:59:40.520
 We do have this whole thing called cryptocurrency.

1:59:40.520 --> 1:59:43.080
 Yeah, in the long arc of history, perhaps.

1:59:43.080 --> 1:59:44.720
 Yeah, we do have that.

1:59:46.040 --> 1:59:46.880
 That's a biggie.

1:59:48.080 --> 1:59:50.720
 And that might've been for it to take hold in society.

1:59:50.720 --> 1:59:52.960
 Maybe the darker parts of society at first,

1:59:52.960 --> 1:59:54.160
 maybe that was necessary.

1:59:54.160 --> 1:59:57.320
 Right, I mean, maybe, we'll see how it pans out.

1:59:57.320 --> 2:00:02.320
 Shadow Crew, we had this guy, Albert Gonzalez,

2:00:02.320 --> 2:00:04.520
 Albert Gonzalez, that's the kid's name.

2:00:04.520 --> 2:00:06.720
 We had, we were growing so big

2:00:06.720 --> 2:00:11.240
 that I had to start farming things out.

2:00:11.240 --> 2:00:12.640
 So the first thing I started farming,

2:00:12.640 --> 2:00:14.760
 I instituted this review system,

2:00:16.320 --> 2:00:18.320
 kind of establishing that trust mechanism

2:00:18.320 --> 2:00:20.040
 even further for criminals to use.

2:00:21.480 --> 2:00:25.040
 We needed somebody to take care of our tech aspects

2:00:25.040 --> 2:00:25.880
 of the forum.

2:00:25.880 --> 2:00:29.560
 So an associate of mine by the name of Kim Taylor,

2:00:29.560 --> 2:00:31.400
 where we're looking for a forum techie,

2:00:31.400 --> 2:00:33.040
 he comes to me one night and he's like,

2:00:33.040 --> 2:00:34.200
 found our forum techie.

2:00:34.200 --> 2:00:35.040
 I was like, who's that?

2:00:35.040 --> 2:00:36.920
 And he's like, it's this kid.

2:00:36.920 --> 2:00:38.400
 And I was like, is he any good?

2:00:38.400 --> 2:00:39.560
 He's like, well, he knows the software.

2:00:39.560 --> 2:00:43.120
 And I was like, okay, we'll just sign his ass on.

2:00:43.120 --> 2:00:45.600
 He went by the screen name of Kumbajonny,

2:00:45.600 --> 2:00:46.800
 was his screen name.

2:00:46.800 --> 2:00:49.800
 And he starts selling credit cards after a while

2:00:49.800 --> 2:00:51.600
 under a screen name of Scarface.

2:00:51.600 --> 2:00:56.600
 And that CB1 breach where you're cashing out

2:00:56.600 --> 2:01:01.600
 the track twos at ATMs, $40,000 a day.

2:01:02.040 --> 2:01:06.840
 So Albert's in New Jersey one day, broad daylight,

2:01:06.840 --> 2:01:11.840
 and stands at an ATM for 40 minutes, just standing there,

2:01:11.960 --> 2:01:16.240
 feeding in one ATM card after another, pulling out cash,

2:01:16.240 --> 2:01:19.600
 taking the 20s out, stuffing them in that backpack.

2:01:19.600 --> 2:01:21.320
 Meanwhile, just across the street,

2:01:21.320 --> 2:01:23.920
 a couple of cops just happened to be there.

2:01:23.920 --> 2:01:28.320
 And they start noticing this kid just standing there.

2:01:28.320 --> 2:01:31.600
 So 40 minutes, they watch this kid, 40 minutes.

2:01:31.600 --> 2:01:33.560
 Finally, one cop looks at the other,

2:01:33.560 --> 2:01:35.280
 let me see what's going on there.

2:01:36.240 --> 2:01:39.240
 Walks over across the street, Albert's wearing a wig.

2:01:39.240 --> 2:01:42.000
 He's got the disguise on, everything else like that.

2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:43.960
 Ask him, kid, what are you doing?

2:01:43.960 --> 2:01:45.280
 Albert falls apart.

2:01:46.480 --> 2:01:48.760
 We didn't know Albert had been arrested.

2:01:48.760 --> 2:01:51.200
 So Albert immediately goes in,

2:01:51.200 --> 2:01:55.040
 I wanna work for the Secret Service.

2:01:55.040 --> 2:01:57.160
 At that point in time, Secret Service,

2:01:59.560 --> 2:02:03.200
 I referred to, and I wanna make sure I don't say,

2:02:03.200 --> 2:02:04.720
 it's not like that anymore.

2:02:04.720 --> 2:02:07.920
 But back then, they were fucking idiots, all right?

2:02:07.920 --> 2:02:09.520
 They had no clue what was going on.

2:02:09.520 --> 2:02:10.960
 So there was a competence issue

2:02:10.960 --> 2:02:12.760
 that they were working through is one way to put it.

2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:15.200
 That's a nice euphemism.

2:02:15.200 --> 2:02:19.000
 So, or fucking idiots is another way to say it.

2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:21.800
 So they're just not aware of the digital world.

2:02:21.800 --> 2:02:23.080
 They had no clue, no clue.

2:02:23.080 --> 2:02:26.160
 The way that Albert tells them how to catch us

2:02:26.160 --> 2:02:28.640
 because they looked at him, how do we catch them?

2:02:28.640 --> 2:02:32.440
 And Albert's like, Albert, I'm serious, I'm serious.

2:02:32.440 --> 2:02:35.680
 So Albert's like, well, you could try a VPN.

2:02:35.680 --> 2:02:37.480
 What's a VPN?

2:02:37.480 --> 2:02:39.840
 So he explains it to them, they're like,

2:02:39.840 --> 2:02:41.800
 that's a good idea.

2:02:41.800 --> 2:02:43.920
 So I quit Shadow Crew.

2:02:43.920 --> 2:02:45.080
 I was worried about all the news

2:02:45.080 --> 2:02:46.200
 that was coming in and everything like that.

2:02:46.200 --> 2:02:47.840
 I'm stealing 160K a week.

2:02:47.840 --> 2:02:49.800
 I didn't know Albert had been arrested.

2:02:51.400 --> 2:02:52.520
 I'm worried about being arrested.

2:02:52.520 --> 2:02:54.520
 I know the writing's on the wall.

2:02:54.520 --> 2:02:56.680
 And I'm like, I'm quitting.

2:02:56.680 --> 2:02:58.400
 Where did you see the writing?

2:02:58.400 --> 2:03:00.400
 The IPs that were coming in,

2:03:00.400 --> 2:03:03.320
 the text messages about the Secret Service investigators

2:03:03.320 --> 2:03:04.160
 I referred to.

2:03:04.160 --> 2:03:05.600
 So the pressure's building.

2:03:05.600 --> 2:03:06.840
 This is not gonna end well.

2:03:06.840 --> 2:03:09.080
 This is going to be bad.

2:03:09.080 --> 2:03:13.560
 So I announced my retirement of February 15th,

2:03:13.560 --> 2:03:18.200
 I'm sorry, April 15th, 2004 is my retirement.

2:03:18.200 --> 2:03:19.920
 I think that's the 2004.

2:03:19.920 --> 2:03:22.720
 And I quit, I walk away.

2:03:22.720 --> 2:03:24.960
 Well, Albert had been arrested.

2:03:24.960 --> 2:03:26.200
 They cut him loose.

2:03:26.200 --> 2:03:27.320
 No one knows he's been arrested.

2:03:27.320 --> 2:03:29.120
 He comes back into Shadow Crew.

2:03:29.120 --> 2:03:31.720
 I leave Kim Taylor at the same time.

2:03:31.720 --> 2:03:34.520
 He's kind of on the run, which if you wanna know that story,

2:03:34.520 --> 2:03:36.880
 that's a nightmare story in and of itself.

2:03:36.880 --> 2:03:40.400
 So my second in charge, Kim Taylor, this guy,

2:03:40.400 --> 2:03:45.200
 there was this guy named David, oh, what was his name?

2:03:46.240 --> 2:03:49.080
 He was, El Mariachi was the guy's name.

2:03:49.080 --> 2:03:50.320
 David Thomas.

2:03:50.320 --> 2:03:52.480
 David, yeah, he was a film guy.

2:03:53.440 --> 2:03:54.920
 Scarface.

2:03:54.920 --> 2:03:58.400
 So El Mariachi, real name David Thomas,

2:03:58.400 --> 2:04:02.320
 he's on the run out of Nebraska for check fraud.

2:04:02.320 --> 2:04:06.280
 He comes to us on Shadow Crew telling us this sad story.

2:04:06.280 --> 2:04:09.000
 We take up a collection for this guy.

2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:10.600
 Send it to him, all right?

2:04:10.600 --> 2:04:13.800
 I get him a job working with a low level carter

2:04:13.800 --> 2:04:16.640
 trying to make him some money, all right?

2:04:16.640 --> 2:04:19.320
 El Mariachi, Thomas does this for a few weeks,

2:04:19.320 --> 2:04:20.480
 comes to me one day and he's like,

2:04:20.480 --> 2:04:22.080
 man, I'm not making any money.

2:04:22.080 --> 2:04:23.440
 I'm like, okay, let me see what I can do.

2:04:23.440 --> 2:04:27.120
 Well, I had a Ukrainian guy by the name of Big Buyer.

2:04:27.120 --> 2:04:29.440
 He, a real friend of mine.

2:04:29.440 --> 2:04:30.920
 And I contacted him, I was like, look, man,

2:04:30.920 --> 2:04:32.160
 I got a guy that wants to do some work.

2:04:32.160 --> 2:04:33.000
 Can you help the guy out?

2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:34.000
 And he's like, I got it.

2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:35.120
 I was like, okay.

2:04:35.120 --> 2:04:38.480
 So he sends Thomas enough money to go,

2:04:38.480 --> 2:04:40.320
 Thomas is in Texas at that point,

2:04:40.320 --> 2:04:43.360
 sends Thomas enough money to go from Texas

2:04:43.360 --> 2:04:47.640
 to Issaquah, Washington and rent an office space, all right?

2:04:48.560 --> 2:04:51.000
 So Thomas goes up there, rents his office space,

2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:54.360
 him and his girlfriend rents an office space.

2:04:54.360 --> 2:04:59.360
 And the plan is, is Big Buyer is going to place an order,

2:04:59.920 --> 2:05:03.320
 get product sent, Mariachi is going to get the product,

2:05:03.320 --> 2:05:07.120
 list it on eBay, cash out 50 50, easy enough, all right?

2:05:07.120 --> 2:05:09.040
 So Big Buyer places an order.

2:05:09.040 --> 2:05:11.960
 First order is outpost.com, $18,000.

2:05:13.320 --> 2:05:16.320
 The largest order outpost.com had ever received

2:05:16.320 --> 2:05:17.440
 at that point in time.

2:05:18.480 --> 2:05:19.760
 Order goes through.

2:05:19.760 --> 2:05:20.640
 It goes through still.

2:05:20.640 --> 2:05:23.640
 Goes through, he gets the product, all right?

2:05:23.640 --> 2:05:25.160
 Mariachi comes back, tells me,

2:05:25.160 --> 2:05:27.080
 tells my second in charge, Kim Taylor.

2:05:27.080 --> 2:05:31.120
 Kim Taylor at this point, I'm 33, 34.

2:05:31.120 --> 2:05:32.520
 Kim Taylor's 46.

2:05:32.520 --> 2:05:35.000
 He works at the Tattered Cover Bookstore

2:05:35.000 --> 2:05:37.840
 in Denver, Colorado is where he works at this point.

2:05:37.840 --> 2:05:40.960
 And he fancies himself Jason Bourne, all right?

2:05:40.960 --> 2:05:43.720
 He's even got one of the screen names of Jason Bourne.

2:05:43.720 --> 2:05:46.400
 So I'm like, all right, so Mariachi is telling us

2:05:46.400 --> 2:05:48.320
 how much money he's making, everything else.

2:05:48.320 --> 2:05:49.160
 I'm like, well, that's good.

2:05:49.160 --> 2:05:50.360
 I'm glad you're all right.

2:05:50.360 --> 2:05:53.400
 Kim contacts me and he's like, I want to go to Issaquah.

2:05:53.400 --> 2:05:54.240
 And I was like, why?

2:05:54.240 --> 2:05:55.520
 And he's like, to make some money.

2:05:55.520 --> 2:05:57.120
 I'm like, you're making money.

2:05:57.120 --> 2:05:58.640
 He's like, I want to go to Issaquah.

2:05:58.640 --> 2:06:00.800
 I was like, all right, go, be careful.

2:06:00.800 --> 2:06:04.560
 So he gets in the car, Saturn is what he's driving.

2:06:04.560 --> 2:06:06.880
 He drives his little piece of Saturn

2:06:06.880 --> 2:06:08.440
 all the way up to Issaquah.

2:06:08.440 --> 2:06:10.680
 Gets there, you know, midnight.

2:06:10.680 --> 2:06:12.520
 They party all night long

2:06:12.520 --> 2:06:14.240
 because they've never met each other.

2:06:14.240 --> 2:06:16.160
 They're just celebrating, partying, drinking,

2:06:16.160 --> 2:06:17.760
 everything else like that.

2:06:17.760 --> 2:06:22.280
 Meanwhile, Big Buyer has placed another order

2:06:23.440 --> 2:06:27.200
 with Outpost.com, $17,000.

2:06:27.200 --> 2:06:31.320
 The second largest order Outpost.com had ever received

2:06:31.320 --> 2:06:33.480
 at that point in time.

2:06:33.480 --> 2:06:35.400
 By this point in time, Outpost knows

2:06:35.400 --> 2:06:37.040
 the first order was fraudulent.

2:06:37.040 --> 2:06:38.200
 Guess where it's going?

2:06:38.200 --> 2:06:41.200
 The exact same address the first order goes.

2:06:41.200 --> 2:06:44.200
 So Outpost picks up the phone, calls Issaquah PD.

2:06:44.200 --> 2:06:46.560
 Hey, we got a fraudster.

2:06:46.560 --> 2:06:51.280
 Issaquah's like, would you mind sending some empty boxes?

2:06:51.280 --> 2:06:54.440
 And Outpost is like, be happy to.

2:06:54.440 --> 2:06:58.280
 So the rule was, is on credit card fraud,

2:06:58.280 --> 2:07:00.600
 if you've got full account access,

2:07:00.600 --> 2:07:01.920
 you place the order.

2:07:01.920 --> 2:07:03.720
 The morning it's supposed to arrive,

2:07:03.720 --> 2:07:06.240
 you sign into the bank account or the credit card account.

2:07:06.240 --> 2:07:09.200
 If you can sign in, you go pick up your product.

2:07:09.200 --> 2:07:12.480
 If you can't sign in, you go back to sleep that day.

2:07:12.480 --> 2:07:13.760
 All right?

2:07:13.760 --> 2:07:16.320
 Well, Big Buyer was the guy who placed the order.

2:07:17.160 --> 2:07:20.400
 Mariachi and my second in charge are partying, all right?

2:07:20.400 --> 2:07:24.320
 So they're supposed to contact Big Buyer, they don't.

2:07:24.320 --> 2:07:26.920
 Meanwhile, Big Buyer is raising hell,

2:07:26.920 --> 2:07:31.200
 getting up with me like, hey, where are the guys?

2:07:31.200 --> 2:07:32.320
 I can't find them.

2:07:32.320 --> 2:07:34.440
 They don't need to pick up this product.

2:07:34.440 --> 2:07:36.360
 So I can't get in touch with them.

2:07:36.360 --> 2:07:37.480
 They go down to pick up the,

2:07:37.480 --> 2:07:41.480
 so Mariachi's got a Cadillac, old 70s Cadillac.

2:07:41.480 --> 2:07:45.640
 He's got a Cadillac, pulls into the complex.

2:07:45.640 --> 2:07:47.520
 Now Mariachi's driving,

2:07:49.040 --> 2:07:50.840
 Kim Taylor's in the passenger seat,

2:07:51.680 --> 2:07:54.200
 David Thomas's girlfriend's in the back seat.

2:07:54.200 --> 2:07:55.880
 As they pull into the complex,

2:07:55.880 --> 2:07:57.600
 going through the parking lot,

2:07:57.600 --> 2:08:00.640
 Mariachi just happens to glance over and he sees a van

2:08:00.640 --> 2:08:03.000
 with a guy sitting sideways in the van.

2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:05.680
 And he looks at Kim Taylor and he's like,

2:08:05.680 --> 2:08:07.840
 that's an undercover.

2:08:07.840 --> 2:08:10.520
 And Kim's like, ah, it's fine.

2:08:10.520 --> 2:08:13.600
 So they pull up to the office complex.

2:08:13.600 --> 2:08:16.720
 Kim's like, I'll go in and get the packages.

2:08:16.720 --> 2:08:19.640
 So he walks in, looks at the guy behind the counter.

2:08:19.640 --> 2:08:21.240
 I believe you have some packages for us.

2:08:21.240 --> 2:08:23.440
 Guy's like, one second.

2:08:23.440 --> 2:08:26.120
 So he disappears around the wall,

2:08:26.120 --> 2:08:29.760
 out pops the Issaquah PD, arrests Kim.

2:08:29.760 --> 2:08:32.480
 David Thomas is in the car watching all this happen.

2:08:32.480 --> 2:08:37.000
 He bugs out and they arrest him on the interstate

2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:40.240
 where he has three fake driver's licenses in his wallet

2:08:40.240 --> 2:08:43.200
 along with his real driver's license, another no, no,

2:08:43.200 --> 2:08:44.200
 but they get him.

2:08:44.200 --> 2:08:48.160
 So David Thomas had outstanding warrants out of Nebraska.

2:08:48.160 --> 2:08:50.160
 We couldn't bond him out.

2:08:50.160 --> 2:08:52.320
 Kim Taylor didn't have any warrants.

2:08:52.320 --> 2:08:53.840
 So we bonded him out.

2:08:53.840 --> 2:08:58.840
 My third in charge, kid, Seth Sanders was his name.

2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:02.640
 He bonds him out, uses his girlfriend's account

2:09:02.640 --> 2:09:03.520
 to bond him out.

2:09:03.520 --> 2:09:08.520
 And I get Kim Taylor to go to Utah

2:09:09.040 --> 2:09:13.560
 where another friend of mine agrees to house him,

2:09:13.560 --> 2:09:15.240
 him and his wife.

2:09:15.240 --> 2:09:17.400
 So I think everything's fine and all that.

2:09:18.720 --> 2:09:21.400
 About three weeks later, this guy in Utah

2:09:21.400 --> 2:09:22.240
 gets me on the phone.

2:09:22.240 --> 2:09:24.400
 I'm like, hey, he's got to go.

2:09:24.400 --> 2:09:27.640
 I'm like, what's going on?

2:09:27.640 --> 2:09:30.560
 He's like, well, the only thing he's doing

2:09:30.560 --> 2:09:33.840
 is popping ecstasy tablets every day, all day.

2:09:33.840 --> 2:09:35.200
 And I'm like, seriously?

2:09:35.200 --> 2:09:36.040
 He's like, yeah.

2:09:36.040 --> 2:09:37.120
 I was like, okay, he's got to go.

2:09:37.120 --> 2:09:38.880
 So we kick him out of there.

2:09:38.880 --> 2:09:40.640
 By this point, I've got another crew that's coming through.

2:09:40.640 --> 2:09:42.440
 I mean, I had all these crews running.

2:09:42.440 --> 2:09:45.380
 Had another crew that's coming through Denver.

2:09:45.380 --> 2:09:49.060
 Send Kim back to Denver to partner up with these guys.

2:09:50.160 --> 2:09:52.080
 Kim gets these guys arrested.

2:09:52.080 --> 2:09:54.800
 So by this point in time, I'm exasperated.

2:09:54.800 --> 2:09:57.960
 I just want to throw my hands up in the air and walk away.

2:09:57.960 --> 2:10:00.720
 So my retirement's coming up at the same time.

2:10:00.720 --> 2:10:03.680
 So I'm like, fuck it, I'm done.

2:10:03.680 --> 2:10:06.120
 So I tell everybody, the rest of the admins

2:10:06.120 --> 2:10:08.000
 and the mods there, I'm like, this is what's going on.

2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:09.480
 You guys need to watch out for this.

2:10:09.480 --> 2:10:11.960
 We need to ban Kim, not let him back in.

2:10:11.960 --> 2:10:13.400
 Be careful what's going on.

2:10:13.400 --> 2:10:15.220
 I walk away.

2:10:15.220 --> 2:10:17.860
 At the same time I walk away,

2:10:17.860 --> 2:10:20.880
 Cumberjani, Albert Gonzalez, comes back into play.

2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:22.560
 He sees everything that's going on.

2:10:22.560 --> 2:10:24.080
 He uses that to his advantage.

2:10:24.080 --> 2:10:26.880
 He starts banning everyone that's suspicious of him,

2:10:26.880 --> 2:10:29.280
 sets up the VPN at the same time and says,

2:10:29.280 --> 2:10:31.560
 hey, to make sure we're all secure,

2:10:31.560 --> 2:10:34.880
 I need all transactions to go through this VPN.

2:10:34.880 --> 2:10:37.560
 VPNs ran by the Secret Service.

2:10:37.560 --> 2:10:39.320
 All right, Secret Service ends up,

2:10:39.320 --> 2:10:41.560
 I think they ended up cataloging like $7 million

2:10:41.560 --> 2:10:45.160
 worth of transactions over the next four or five months.

2:10:45.160 --> 2:10:49.760
 Shadow Crew makes the front cover of Forbes, August, 2004.

2:10:49.760 --> 2:10:51.720
 Headline, Who's Stealing Your Identity.

2:10:52.600 --> 2:10:56.720
 October 26, 2004, United States Secret Service arrest,

2:10:56.720 --> 2:11:00.360
 33 people, six countries, six hours.

2:11:00.360 --> 2:11:02.860
 I was in Charleston, South Carolina when I saw it happen.

2:11:02.860 --> 2:11:03.700
 And I'm like.

2:11:03.700 --> 2:11:08.480
 So you're the one that got away.

2:11:08.480 --> 2:11:09.320
 I'm the one public.

2:11:09.320 --> 2:11:10.760
 There were a couple other guys that got away

2:11:10.760 --> 2:11:12.480
 that they didn't publicly mention.

2:11:12.480 --> 2:11:14.960
 One, his name was Tron.

2:11:14.960 --> 2:11:17.080
 He was a zero.

2:11:17.080 --> 2:11:18.160
 Yeah, exactly.

2:11:18.160 --> 2:11:21.000
 But he went by the screen name Tron.

2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:25.320
 He had access, almost unfettered access to Bank of America.

2:11:27.240 --> 2:11:29.600
 So what happens is they identified the guy,

2:11:29.600 --> 2:11:31.800
 Secret Service is in the air to go get him.

2:11:31.800 --> 2:11:33.400
 They call the Ukrainian police.

2:11:33.400 --> 2:11:34.840
 Hey, we're coming down to arrest this guy.

2:11:34.840 --> 2:11:38.000
 Ukrainian cops are like, oh, come on down.

2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:39.320
 So as soon as they got off the phone,

2:11:39.320 --> 2:11:42.380
 Ukrainian cops get in the car, go down and tell Tron,

2:11:42.380 --> 2:11:44.520
 hey, they're coming to get you.

2:11:44.520 --> 2:11:45.360
 Yeah.

2:11:45.360 --> 2:11:47.800
 So he bugs out down to South America

2:11:47.800 --> 2:11:50.480
 and they don't catch him I think for six or seven years

2:11:50.480 --> 2:11:51.320
 after that, something like that.

2:11:51.320 --> 2:11:52.680
 But caught him eventually.

2:11:52.680 --> 2:11:53.520
 Caught him eventually.

2:11:53.520 --> 2:11:55.720
 Well, let me actually ask you on this point.

2:11:55.720 --> 2:11:59.680
 You've said that if you do cyber crime eventually,

2:11:59.680 --> 2:12:00.880
 it's not gonna end well.

2:12:00.880 --> 2:12:02.200
 It does not end well.

2:12:02.200 --> 2:12:03.760
 Why is that?

2:12:03.760 --> 2:12:05.440
 So I don't wanna say that's because

2:12:05.440 --> 2:12:07.380
 you're gonna be arrested because honestly,

2:12:07.380 --> 2:12:10.200
 very few people are arrested, all right?

2:12:10.200 --> 2:12:13.720
 But it doesn't end well because of the type of person

2:12:13.720 --> 2:12:14.800
 that you become.

2:12:14.800 --> 2:12:19.800
 You quoted me earlier, you lie to everybody around you.

2:12:21.520 --> 2:12:23.360
 You lie to yourself, you lie to your friends,

2:12:23.360 --> 2:12:24.200
 you lie to your family.

2:12:24.200 --> 2:12:25.760
 Of course, you lie to your victims.

2:12:25.760 --> 2:12:27.800
 You don't have any friends.

2:12:27.800 --> 2:12:30.860
 You know, I went 20 years without friends.

2:12:30.860 --> 2:12:33.520
 I had associates, I didn't have friends.

2:12:33.520 --> 2:12:35.280
 And you can't truly trust anybody.

2:12:35.280 --> 2:12:36.700
 You don't trust anybody.

2:12:36.700 --> 2:12:37.680
 You don't trust anybody.

2:12:37.680 --> 2:12:41.640
 You know, I had my wife, I was married for nine years.

2:12:41.640 --> 2:12:46.200
 I lied to her every single day of those nine years.

2:12:46.200 --> 2:12:49.720
 And it took her nine years to give up on me,

2:12:49.720 --> 2:12:52.500
 to realize that I was that piece of shit.

2:12:52.500 --> 2:12:55.480
 And she leaves at that point.

2:12:55.480 --> 2:12:58.280
 Then from there, I started dating a stripper

2:12:58.280 --> 2:12:59.920
 and lied to her.

2:12:59.920 --> 2:13:00.840
 I thought I had friends.

2:13:00.840 --> 2:13:02.680
 I lied to all those people that I knew

2:13:02.680 --> 2:13:04.720
 that thought they were my friends.

2:13:04.720 --> 2:13:06.940
 I lied to them the entire time.

2:13:06.940 --> 2:13:08.760
 You become that individual.

2:13:08.760 --> 2:13:11.800
 I don't think a lot of people really understand

2:13:13.240 --> 2:13:14.220
 how bad that is.

2:13:14.220 --> 2:13:17.200
 You know, you talked about, you pointed out that woman

2:13:17.200 --> 2:13:18.040
 that I ripped off.

2:13:18.040 --> 2:13:20.080
 She was trying to put a roof on her house

2:13:20.080 --> 2:13:22.000
 for her freaking kids, man.

2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:23.680
 You're that person.

2:13:23.680 --> 2:13:24.880
 You're that person.

2:13:24.880 --> 2:13:27.400
 So you're also lying to yourself.

2:13:29.020 --> 2:13:32.560
 And that's not a mindset in which you can

2:13:34.560 --> 2:13:38.500
 grow as a person, find happiness,

2:13:38.500 --> 2:13:41.080
 find genuine, simple human affection,

2:13:41.080 --> 2:13:42.960
 which is what love is.

2:13:42.960 --> 2:13:46.080
 Simple, real friendship, all of those things.

2:13:46.080 --> 2:13:48.360
 So I went to prison, of course.

2:13:48.360 --> 2:13:50.620
 One of the things, one of the most important lessons

2:13:50.620 --> 2:13:52.600
 that I've learned in prison,

2:13:52.600 --> 2:13:54.480
 because cyber crime as a whole,

2:13:54.480 --> 2:13:56.960
 if you're a criminal, it's an addiction, all right?

2:13:56.960 --> 2:13:57.960
 If you're addicted to something,

2:13:57.960 --> 2:14:00.520
 whether it be drugs, crime, gambling, what have you,

2:14:00.520 --> 2:14:01.760
 if you're addicted to something,

2:14:01.760 --> 2:14:05.880
 you cannot love anything else except the addiction.

2:14:05.880 --> 2:14:08.640
 The addiction comes first, all right?

2:14:08.640 --> 2:14:12.680
 And you pointed out some of those truly despicable things.

2:14:13.640 --> 2:14:16.040
 Script, for example, tortures that guy.

2:14:16.040 --> 2:14:18.000
 You get to the point where it's like,

2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:20.520
 okay, this is the business.

2:14:20.520 --> 2:14:25.380
 And I tried to convince myself that I'm a businessman,

2:14:25.380 --> 2:14:27.120
 but I'm a good guy on the other end.

2:14:27.120 --> 2:14:28.600
 And you're not, you're not.

2:14:28.600 --> 2:14:31.960
 So those lies become part of it, everything else.

2:14:31.960 --> 2:14:36.960
 And yeah, the higher ups are usually arrested, they are.

2:14:37.600 --> 2:14:40.320
 But you've got millions of cyber criminals these days.

2:14:40.320 --> 2:14:43.120
 So most guys are not gonna be arrested.

2:14:43.120 --> 2:14:45.040
 So you may be arrested.

2:14:45.040 --> 2:14:49.520
 You may be like freaking Jonathan James.

2:14:49.520 --> 2:14:53.080
 He was a minor, a very, very talented individual,

2:14:53.080 --> 2:14:54.280
 very competent.

2:14:54.280 --> 2:14:57.600
 He had, as a kid, he had broke into NASA,

2:14:57.600 --> 2:14:59.080
 the OD, Pentagon.

2:14:59.080 --> 2:15:01.520
 He shut the NASA computers down for six weeks.

2:15:01.520 --> 2:15:03.520
 This is that kid.

2:15:03.520 --> 2:15:06.120
 Then he decides he wants to go into credit card theft,

2:15:06.120 --> 2:15:08.520
 partners with Albert, he's arrested with Albert.

2:15:09.640 --> 2:15:13.240
 Law enforcement, they were gonna blame him.

2:15:13.240 --> 2:15:15.980
 He was the only competent individual.

2:15:15.980 --> 2:15:19.280
 So this kid gets up one day, he wasn't in prison yet.

2:15:19.280 --> 2:15:21.200
 He gets up one day, goes in his dad's bedroom,

2:15:21.200 --> 2:15:24.320
 gets out his 45, walks in the bathroom,

2:15:24.320 --> 2:15:26.580
 and blows his brains out.

2:15:26.580 --> 2:15:28.880
 You know, you've got things like that.

2:15:29.980 --> 2:15:31.240
 Or you're gonna rip somebody off,

2:15:31.240 --> 2:15:32.960
 and you're gonna end up like scripted with that guy,

2:15:32.960 --> 2:15:37.280
 the guy who ran Evolution Marketplace.

2:15:37.280 --> 2:15:39.880
 No one knew who, two people ran that guy and a girl.

2:15:40.760 --> 2:15:42.840
 And no one knew who they were.

2:15:42.840 --> 2:15:45.080
 He ends up stealing about $24 million,

2:15:45.080 --> 2:15:46.880
 a lot of it from Ukrainian mob,

2:15:46.880 --> 2:15:48.760
 and they found him about a year later

2:15:48.760 --> 2:15:51.160
 on a beach without his head in hands.

2:15:51.160 --> 2:15:53.360
 But you know, it always goes south.

2:15:53.360 --> 2:15:54.920
 But more than anything, to me,

2:15:54.920 --> 2:15:59.920
 the negative thing is you really become somebody that,

2:16:02.240 --> 2:16:05.720
 I mean, just truly a despicable human being.

2:16:05.720 --> 2:16:09.840
 When you get to the point when you're destroying

2:16:09.840 --> 2:16:11.980
 people's retirement accounts,

2:16:11.980 --> 2:16:13.360
 you're stealing money from a woman

2:16:13.360 --> 2:16:18.220
 that simply wants to do something good for her family.

2:16:18.220 --> 2:16:20.560
 When you become that individual,

2:16:20.560 --> 2:16:23.240
 and you're okay with that, my God, man.

2:16:23.240 --> 2:16:26.360
 It got to the point, I had one guy I ripped off,

2:16:26.360 --> 2:16:27.600
 it's like for $900,

2:16:27.600 --> 2:16:29.920
 is when I first started the cybercrime stuff.

2:16:29.920 --> 2:16:31.980
 It's when I was becoming competent.

2:16:31.980 --> 2:16:35.560
 And I ripped him off for like $900,

2:16:35.560 --> 2:16:40.560
 and he sent me an email, and he was like,

2:16:41.080 --> 2:16:42.620
 the email said something like,

2:16:43.740 --> 2:16:47.680
 I guess you needed the money, and it's okay.

2:16:47.680 --> 2:16:48.880
 You know, you keep it.

2:16:48.880 --> 2:16:52.040
 And I'm getting chills right now thinking about it.

2:16:52.040 --> 2:16:56.980
 It's that, where you become that individual.

2:17:00.160 --> 2:17:01.000
 Yeah.

2:17:02.020 --> 2:17:03.460
 Can I actually backtrack?

2:17:03.460 --> 2:17:06.260
 Listen, I love love, okay?

2:17:06.260 --> 2:17:07.100
 I do too.

2:17:07.100 --> 2:17:11.320
 And there's a story that you fell in love with a stripper.

2:17:11.320 --> 2:17:13.160
 I mean, you have to tell the story.

2:17:13.160 --> 2:17:17.240
 So how did you fall in love with somebody,

2:17:17.240 --> 2:17:19.040
 not that there's anything wrong with that profession,

2:17:19.040 --> 2:17:20.800
 but it's romantic.

2:17:20.800 --> 2:17:23.760
 It's like a true romance, by the way, great movie.

2:17:23.760 --> 2:17:24.960
 It is a great film.

2:17:24.960 --> 2:17:27.000
 It's truly a great film.

2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:31.120
 Even Brad Pitt, who makes a brief appearance, is genius.

2:17:31.120 --> 2:17:32.880
 There's so much good acting there.

2:17:32.880 --> 2:17:35.800
 Anyway, so tell me that love story.

2:17:35.800 --> 2:17:39.580
 All right, so like I said, from my dad,

2:17:39.580 --> 2:17:41.920
 I get that fear of being abandoned.

2:17:41.920 --> 2:17:45.520
 I lied to my wife for nine years until she leaves.

2:17:45.520 --> 2:17:48.100
 And I was in Charleston, South Carolina.

2:17:48.100 --> 2:17:51.880
 And what happened was, I noticed that Susan,

2:17:53.120 --> 2:17:56.120
 she was not coming to bed like she used to.

2:17:56.120 --> 2:17:57.500
 She'd stay up all night long,

2:17:57.500 --> 2:18:01.080
 and sometimes she'd go and be gone a few hours

2:18:01.080 --> 2:18:02.160
 and everything else.

2:18:02.160 --> 2:18:03.400
 And I'm like, well, something's going on.

2:18:03.400 --> 2:18:05.520
 And I'd pass by her computer

2:18:05.520 --> 2:18:06.960
 and she would minimize the screens.

2:18:06.960 --> 2:18:08.840
 And I'm like, well, gotta figure out

2:18:08.840 --> 2:18:10.880
 what the hell is going on.

2:18:10.880 --> 2:18:13.400
 So put a key logger on her system.

2:18:13.400 --> 2:18:17.160
 As anybody should in a relationship.

2:18:17.160 --> 2:18:20.880
 Absolutely, because you trust them, so why not?

2:18:20.880 --> 2:18:22.360
 You should be tracking all their movements,

2:18:22.360 --> 2:18:23.200
 all their stuff.

2:18:23.200 --> 2:18:24.240
 Exactly, exactly.

2:18:24.240 --> 2:18:26.040
 Like I said, I was the control freak too.

2:18:26.040 --> 2:18:26.880
 It's romantic.

2:18:26.880 --> 2:18:29.560
 So I found out she'd been cheating on me.

2:18:29.560 --> 2:18:30.400
 And she was.

2:18:30.400 --> 2:18:31.920
 See, there you go, they had a reason.

2:18:31.920 --> 2:18:34.040
 They had a reason, I justified.

2:18:34.040 --> 2:18:35.360
 So I found out she was cheating on me.

2:18:35.360 --> 2:18:36.800
 She was asleep when I found it out.

2:18:36.800 --> 2:18:40.040
 And I sat there looking at it and I was like, well, shit.

2:18:40.040 --> 2:18:42.160
 So I got up, walked in the bedroom,

2:18:42.160 --> 2:18:45.160
 opened up the wardrobe, got a suitcase out,

2:18:45.160 --> 2:18:46.720
 started putting her clothes in it.

2:18:46.720 --> 2:18:48.800
 And she wakes up, she's like, where are you going?

2:18:48.800 --> 2:18:51.360
 And I'm like, I'm not, you are.

2:18:51.360 --> 2:18:54.720
 Well, my bravado disappeared pretty quickly.

2:18:54.720 --> 2:18:58.680
 I took about a week of both of us

2:18:58.680 --> 2:19:01.260
 crying and arguing and everything else.

2:19:01.260 --> 2:19:03.640
 And she finally left.

2:19:03.640 --> 2:19:07.400
 And I went through this depression.

2:19:07.400 --> 2:19:09.400
 I was in Charleston, South Carolina.

2:19:09.400 --> 2:19:12.960
 I would just walk around the house kind of stumbling in a daze.

2:19:12.960 --> 2:19:15.240
 Realized I was getting suicidal.

2:19:15.240 --> 2:19:18.440
 And was smart enough to do something about it.

2:19:18.440 --> 2:19:19.840
 And picked up the phone book.

2:19:19.840 --> 2:19:22.320
 And that's where there's always this sense of humor.

2:19:22.320 --> 2:19:23.520
 So I picked up the phone book.

2:19:23.520 --> 2:19:25.020
 I'm going through the yellow pages.

2:19:25.020 --> 2:19:27.220
 I'm like, psychologist, criminal psychologist,

2:19:27.220 --> 2:19:30.280
 because I need that.

2:19:30.280 --> 2:19:32.000
 Called the psychologist, crying to her.

2:19:32.000 --> 2:19:33.040
 I mean, crying on the phone.

2:19:33.040 --> 2:19:33.760
 Told her everything.

2:19:33.760 --> 2:19:34.360
 I'm this criminal.

2:19:34.360 --> 2:19:35.400
 This is what's happened.

2:19:35.400 --> 2:19:36.760
 She's like, come in now.

2:19:36.760 --> 2:19:39.000
 So I go in, spill my guts.

2:19:39.000 --> 2:19:42.240
 And saw her for about four months.

2:19:42.240 --> 2:19:43.960
 And I joke about it, but it's true.

2:19:43.960 --> 2:19:47.440
 She was trying to get me to stop breaking the law

2:19:47.440 --> 2:19:48.840
 and to go into real estate.

2:19:48.840 --> 2:19:51.920
 And I remember telling her, is there a difference?

2:19:51.920 --> 2:19:54.640
 She was like, yes, there's a difference.

2:19:54.640 --> 2:19:57.080
 So I saw her for about four months.

2:19:57.080 --> 2:19:59.160
 I was 34.

2:19:59.160 --> 2:20:02.200
 I didn't start drinking until I was 34.

2:20:02.200 --> 2:20:04.640
 I'd never done drugs or anything else like that,

2:20:04.640 --> 2:20:07.040
 because my mom was an addict as well.

2:20:07.040 --> 2:20:09.680
 So I was this guy that always wanted to be in control.

2:20:09.680 --> 2:20:13.520
 Didn't want to lose control of myself.

2:20:13.520 --> 2:20:16.640
 And had never been to a strip club.

2:20:16.640 --> 2:20:19.520
 So one night, I was getting lonely.

2:20:19.520 --> 2:20:20.760
 So I walked into the strip club.

2:20:20.760 --> 2:20:22.520
 Actually, I was researching the strip club.

2:20:22.520 --> 2:20:27.200
 And it was Joe's Roundup in Charleston, South Carolina.

2:20:27.200 --> 2:20:28.520
 Joe's Roundup.

2:20:28.520 --> 2:20:30.720
 Little bitty hole in the wall stuff.

2:20:30.720 --> 2:20:32.280
 Yeah, real classy.

2:20:32.280 --> 2:20:35.080
 So I walked in, and I'm literally

2:20:35.080 --> 2:20:39.920
 that guy, man, that fell in love with the first stripper

2:20:39.920 --> 2:20:41.420
 that he sees.

2:20:41.420 --> 2:20:44.360
 She walks by, I'm like, that one.

2:20:44.360 --> 2:20:46.240
 So I didn't know the strip club game.

2:20:46.240 --> 2:20:48.320
 Again, criminal, naive as hell.

2:20:48.320 --> 2:20:52.480
 So belly up at the bar, order the beer.

2:20:52.480 --> 2:20:54.400
 I'm sitting there drinking it.

2:20:54.400 --> 2:20:57.800
 She comes over to me, and we start talking.

2:20:57.800 --> 2:21:01.000
 And she's like, would you like to get a bottle of champagne?

2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:03.160
 I was like, does that mean going in back or what?

2:21:03.160 --> 2:21:04.860
 She's like, well, yeah, you need to do the bottle

2:21:04.860 --> 2:21:05.360
 when you're going back.

2:21:05.360 --> 2:21:08.040
 And I was like, sure, let's buy a bottle of champagne.

2:21:08.040 --> 2:21:11.160
 $400 bottle of Korbel.

2:21:11.160 --> 2:21:13.360
 So I'm like, all right.

2:21:13.360 --> 2:21:15.440
 And again, that bravado disappears pretty quickly.

2:21:15.440 --> 2:21:18.880
 I get back there, and we talk for two hours.

2:21:18.880 --> 2:21:21.160
 And nowadays, I don't understand that most men

2:21:21.160 --> 2:21:23.280
 who go to strip clubs, the strippers

2:21:23.280 --> 2:21:26.000
 are their therapist most of the time.

2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:27.800
 So I'm sitting there talking, we're talking.

2:21:27.800 --> 2:21:29.640
 And of course, she's sizing me up.

2:21:29.640 --> 2:21:30.760
 She's looking at the watch.

2:21:30.760 --> 2:21:33.800
 She's like, what kind of car do you drive?

2:21:33.800 --> 2:21:34.520
 Everything else.

2:21:34.520 --> 2:21:36.680
 And I'm telling her and talking.

2:21:36.680 --> 2:21:39.200
 So at the end of the night, I'm like, really nice meeting.

2:21:39.200 --> 2:21:41.920
 She's like, it's so nice meeting you, too.

2:21:41.920 --> 2:21:44.200
 So I leave.

2:21:44.200 --> 2:21:45.400
 You guys just talked.

2:21:45.400 --> 2:21:46.000
 Just talked.

2:21:46.000 --> 2:21:48.840
 And there's still this feeling of love and all of that.

2:21:48.840 --> 2:21:49.840
 Yeah, so just talked.

2:21:49.840 --> 2:21:51.160
 Just got along pretty good.

2:21:51.160 --> 2:21:52.920
 I'm like, I like her.

2:21:52.920 --> 2:21:54.320
 I like her.

2:21:54.320 --> 2:21:57.000
 So come back in a week later.

2:21:57.000 --> 2:21:59.440
 Walk in and call her over.

2:21:59.440 --> 2:22:02.720
 And I was like, look, I said, that was my first time

2:22:02.720 --> 2:22:03.320
 to a strip club.

2:22:03.320 --> 2:22:04.400
 I said, don't know you.

2:22:04.400 --> 2:22:04.840
 I like you.

2:22:04.840 --> 2:22:05.900
 I'd like to know you more.

2:22:05.900 --> 2:22:07.880
 Would you like to go out to dinner?

2:22:07.880 --> 2:22:10.160
 And she was like, yeah.

2:22:10.160 --> 2:22:11.960
 I was like, where would you like to go?

2:22:11.960 --> 2:22:13.800
 So she says, Rue de Jon.

2:22:13.800 --> 2:22:15.560
 And I was like, don't know what it is.

2:22:15.560 --> 2:22:16.440
 That's where we'll go.

2:22:16.440 --> 2:22:16.960
 So I go back.

2:22:16.960 --> 2:22:19.520
 And I had a theater buddy at that point in time

2:22:19.520 --> 2:22:23.120
 because I was trying to get my life together.

2:22:23.120 --> 2:22:24.120
 JC was his name.

2:22:24.120 --> 2:22:25.560
 And I was like, I got a date.

2:22:25.560 --> 2:22:26.760
 He's like, you got a date?

2:22:26.760 --> 2:22:28.320
 I was like, yeah, man, I got a date.

2:22:28.320 --> 2:22:30.440
 And he's like, OK, where are you going?

2:22:30.440 --> 2:22:31.480
 I was like, Rue de Jon.

2:22:31.480 --> 2:22:34.520
 And he's like, take your wallet.

2:22:34.520 --> 2:22:35.120
 I'm like, yeah.

2:22:35.120 --> 2:22:37.480
 And he's like, take your wallet.

2:22:37.480 --> 2:22:38.960
 I was like, all right.

2:22:38.960 --> 2:22:43.720
 So we start doing the lunch and the dinner thing.

2:22:43.720 --> 2:22:47.920
 And I get to where I really like her.

2:22:47.920 --> 2:22:48.720
 I was 34.

2:22:48.720 --> 2:22:52.720
 She was 23 and got along really well,

2:22:52.720 --> 2:22:57.520
 had common interest in music and arts and stuff like that.

2:22:57.520 --> 2:22:59.200
 I mean, it's stereotypical.

2:22:59.200 --> 2:23:05.200
 She had graduated college with a degree in religious studies.

2:23:05.200 --> 2:23:06.400
 Yeah.

2:23:06.400 --> 2:23:08.880
 So I was like, all right.

2:23:08.880 --> 2:23:10.600
 So yeah, you just fell in love.

2:23:10.600 --> 2:23:12.640
 We got along really well, really well.

2:23:12.640 --> 2:23:14.640
 So I ended up moving her in with me.

2:23:14.640 --> 2:23:16.480
 She hadn't quit her job.

2:23:16.480 --> 2:23:22.000
 And what was happening was she was working weekends.

2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:26.840
 And the club would close at 3 or 4.

2:23:26.840 --> 2:23:30.280
 She wouldn't come home until 10 or 11 in the morning.

2:23:30.280 --> 2:23:33.280
 And most of the time, it would be a phone call saying,

2:23:33.280 --> 2:23:34.120
 come and pick me up.

2:23:34.120 --> 2:23:35.960
 I can't drive home.

2:23:35.960 --> 2:23:39.680
 And then I'd never used drugs, had never been around.

2:23:39.680 --> 2:23:42.320
 And my mom, Valium and pot and things like that.

2:23:42.320 --> 2:23:43.840
 But as far as interacting with her,

2:23:43.840 --> 2:23:46.080
 I'd never done anything like that.

2:23:46.080 --> 2:23:48.620
 By this point in time, I'm kind of getting head over heels

2:23:48.620 --> 2:23:48.840
 with her.

2:23:48.840 --> 2:23:50.320
 I moved her in with me and everything.

2:23:50.320 --> 2:23:54.740
 And I had never, I was 34, I had never

2:23:54.740 --> 2:23:57.880
 went through a woman's purse in my entire life.

2:23:57.880 --> 2:24:01.880
 And so she comes in, passes out.

2:24:01.880 --> 2:24:04.440
 And I'm like, I got to know what the fuck's going on.

2:24:04.440 --> 2:24:08.960
 And went over and went through her purse.

2:24:08.960 --> 2:24:13.120
 Found cocaine and the straw, cut off straws and all that stuff.

2:24:13.120 --> 2:24:15.480
 And I'm like, broke my heart.

2:24:15.480 --> 2:24:19.320
 I just sat there and started crying.

2:24:19.320 --> 2:24:23.400
 Got online, and I'm the guy that can find information.

2:24:23.400 --> 2:24:26.840
 So I started looking for forums on strip clubs.

2:24:26.840 --> 2:24:30.040
 Found a forum, found that one, found

2:24:30.040 --> 2:24:33.960
 where it was talking about her prostituting herself

2:24:33.960 --> 2:24:35.920
 to support the habit.

2:24:35.920 --> 2:24:40.540
 And that got me, man.

2:24:40.540 --> 2:24:41.040
 That got me.

2:24:41.040 --> 2:24:45.720
 It was talking about everything she was doing to do that.

2:24:45.720 --> 2:24:46.960
 And I broke your heart there.

2:24:46.960 --> 2:24:48.160
 Oh, man.

2:24:48.160 --> 2:24:49.520
 Yeah.

2:24:49.520 --> 2:24:53.680
 So I didn't have the heart to tell her

2:24:53.680 --> 2:24:55.880
 that I knew she was prostituting.

2:24:55.880 --> 2:24:58.000
 But I went to her, and I was like, she's waking up.

2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:01.280
 And I was like, look, I found this in your purse.

2:25:01.280 --> 2:25:02.680
 I can't have that.

2:25:02.680 --> 2:25:04.480
 And she's like, well, you think I'm prostituting?

2:25:04.480 --> 2:25:06.320
 I was like, no, no, I don't think that.

2:25:06.320 --> 2:25:08.760
 I knew it, but I didn't mention it to her.

2:25:08.760 --> 2:25:11.800
 And I was like, I can't have that.

2:25:11.800 --> 2:25:13.120
 Well, I don't do that.

2:25:13.120 --> 2:25:14.240
 It's just a one time thing.

2:25:14.240 --> 2:25:15.560
 I was like, all right.

2:25:15.560 --> 2:25:18.720
 So she went back to work and continued

2:25:18.720 --> 2:25:20.100
 to do it for a couple more weeks.

2:25:20.100 --> 2:25:23.040
 And then finally, I was like, I can't.

2:25:23.040 --> 2:25:25.320
 So I picked her up one morning.

2:25:25.320 --> 2:25:28.760
 She couldn't drive home.

2:25:28.760 --> 2:25:31.000
 Before I picked her up, I had written her a note,

2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:32.860
 left it on the pillow.

2:25:32.860 --> 2:25:35.560
 So I brought her home, tucked her in the bed,

2:25:35.560 --> 2:25:41.560
 and told her I'd be back that night.

2:25:41.560 --> 2:25:43.880
 Told her she had a letter when she woke up.

2:25:43.880 --> 2:25:46.840
 And the letter was basically, I love you.

2:25:46.840 --> 2:25:50.640
 If you can't stop this, don't be here when I get back.

2:25:50.640 --> 2:25:59.680
 And I went to Columbia that day, came back that night,

2:25:59.680 --> 2:26:03.560
 and she had quit her job.

2:26:07.760 --> 2:26:13.640
 And she quit drugs that night, really quit them.

2:26:13.640 --> 2:26:21.960
 And I got it in my head that I needed

2:26:21.960 --> 2:26:26.160
 to do whatever I needed to do to make sure she didn't go back

2:26:26.160 --> 2:26:29.240
 to that.

2:26:29.240 --> 2:26:35.600
 That became, to me, because of my background,

2:26:35.600 --> 2:26:37.640
 that meant spending a lot of money.

2:26:37.640 --> 2:26:42.520
 And so every night was $300 to $600 for dinner.

2:26:42.520 --> 2:26:49.040
 It was $1,000 shoes every week, $2,000 purse every week,

2:26:49.040 --> 2:26:49.520
 all that.

2:26:49.520 --> 2:26:54.840
 I had most of my money laundered out to Estonia.

2:26:54.840 --> 2:27:02.720
 And Elizabeth, at the same time, she quit.

2:27:02.720 --> 2:27:09.480
 But she didn't want me to go anywhere.

2:27:09.480 --> 2:27:12.040
 All right, she wanted me there all the time.

2:27:12.040 --> 2:27:14.280
 I guess that was that connection.

2:27:14.280 --> 2:27:17.720
 I guess she was scared she might go back to something.

2:27:17.720 --> 2:27:21.680
 So Shadow Crew gets busted.

2:27:21.680 --> 2:27:24.920
 I go through, basically, all my US funds.

2:27:24.920 --> 2:27:26.800
 Can't get anything from overseas.

2:27:26.800 --> 2:27:28.480
 Shadow Crew gets busted October.

2:27:28.480 --> 2:27:32.880
 I can't go into committing tax fraud because season's over.

2:27:32.880 --> 2:27:35.120
 Can't go back into credit fraud because Shadow Crew's

2:27:35.120 --> 2:27:35.760
 been busted.

2:27:35.760 --> 2:27:38.160
 I don't know who to trust online.

2:27:38.160 --> 2:27:40.920
 I'm left with running counterfeit cashier's checks

2:27:40.920 --> 2:27:45.080
 to get money in, trying to make it until I can start back

2:27:45.080 --> 2:27:49.240
 with some other fraud, and lying to her the entire time.

2:27:49.240 --> 2:27:50.840
 She knows about none of this.

2:27:50.840 --> 2:27:53.280
 None of it.

2:27:53.280 --> 2:27:55.800
 And she thinks I've got a shitload of money.

2:27:55.800 --> 2:27:59.360
 And she's got expensive taste.

2:27:59.360 --> 2:28:06.640
 So at the same time, she couldn't be intimate.

2:28:06.640 --> 2:28:09.120
 I mean, the girl loved me.

2:28:09.120 --> 2:28:12.880
 That's the first time I've really said that.

2:28:12.880 --> 2:28:15.480
 So there's deep love there both ways.

2:28:15.480 --> 2:28:17.320
 Yeah.

2:28:17.320 --> 2:28:18.800
 Yeah.

2:28:18.800 --> 2:28:21.480
 Things we do.

2:28:21.480 --> 2:28:30.560
 So she couldn't be intimate unless she was stone cold drunk.

2:28:30.560 --> 2:28:31.760
 I mean, just shit.

2:28:31.760 --> 2:28:34.760
 Stone cold drunk.

2:28:34.760 --> 2:28:38.120
 And shit, I didn't mind her drinking alcohol.

2:28:38.120 --> 2:28:40.840
 I'd rather have that than cocaine.

2:28:40.840 --> 2:28:44.600
 So that was the intimacy there.

2:28:44.600 --> 2:28:51.640
 And I kept thinking, if I continue to invest,

2:28:51.640 --> 2:28:57.160
 that it would work out, that just keep going,

2:28:57.160 --> 2:29:00.400
 she'll be all right, we'll be all right.

2:29:03.760 --> 2:29:07.400
 And what happens is, like I said, she thought I had money.

2:29:07.400 --> 2:29:09.560
 She thought I had money.

2:29:09.560 --> 2:29:11.760
 She wanted a couple of Tiffany engagement rings.

2:29:11.760 --> 2:29:13.920
 So I said, we can get married.

2:29:13.920 --> 2:29:17.000
 I figured of marriage, show her that I love her,

2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:18.440
 show her it's going to be all right.

2:29:18.440 --> 2:29:21.280
 So I was like, let's get married.

2:29:21.280 --> 2:29:23.600
 She's like, well, I've always wanted a Tiffany ring.

2:29:23.600 --> 2:29:25.400
 She doesn't have money to buy the Tiffany ring

2:29:25.400 --> 2:29:26.840
 because all my money was overseas.

2:29:26.840 --> 2:29:27.600
 So here I am.

2:29:27.600 --> 2:29:29.400
 I defraud.

2:29:29.400 --> 2:29:31.200
 So it's counterfeit cashiers.

2:29:31.200 --> 2:29:36.680
 I find like a three carat ring on eBay for 20 grand

2:29:36.680 --> 2:29:40.560
 and pay for it with a counterfeit cashiers check.

2:29:40.560 --> 2:29:43.960
 At the same time, because she doesn't want me to leave,

2:29:43.960 --> 2:29:46.400
 she needs me there, typically, if you're

2:29:46.400 --> 2:29:49.440
 doing that type of crime, you need to be traveling.

2:29:49.440 --> 2:29:51.560
 You can't do it in one central area

2:29:51.560 --> 2:29:53.960
 because you're going to be identified pretty quickly.

2:29:53.960 --> 2:29:57.160
 I knew that, but I didn't have much choice.

2:29:57.160 --> 2:30:00.480
 So start running counterfeit cashiers checks

2:30:00.480 --> 2:30:03.600
 to get the money to live and everything.

2:30:03.600 --> 2:30:06.800
 Get the engagement ring.

2:30:06.800 --> 2:30:13.360
 We were scheduled to be married. Our wedding date

2:30:13.360 --> 2:30:19.080
 was February 26, 2005.

2:30:19.080 --> 2:30:23.000
 February 8, 2005.

2:30:23.000 --> 2:30:28.160
 I've got a Tiffany wedding band, a couple of them coming in.

2:30:28.160 --> 2:30:32.040
 And I get arrested in Charleston, South Carolina.

2:30:32.040 --> 2:30:34.360
 And she didn't know.

2:30:34.360 --> 2:30:36.720
 I told her, I said, I've got to go pick up those rings.

2:30:36.720 --> 2:30:39.080
 She thought I was just having them sent in.

2:30:39.080 --> 2:30:40.680
 I said, I've got to go get those rings.

2:30:40.680 --> 2:30:43.240
 And I said, we'll go out to dinner after that.

2:30:43.240 --> 2:30:49.160
 And I left at like 8 o clock in the morning.

2:30:49.160 --> 2:30:54.680
 And I was arrested at, I think, 1130, something like that.

2:30:54.680 --> 2:30:56.560
 Of course, I wanted to call her.

2:30:56.560 --> 2:30:58.760
 And the FBI got me.

2:30:58.760 --> 2:31:00.560
 It turns out it was controlled delivery.

2:31:00.560 --> 2:31:03.200
 There were like 30 agents in the parking lot.

2:31:03.200 --> 2:31:04.040
 FBI got me.

2:31:04.040 --> 2:31:05.640
 Charleston PD got me.

2:31:05.640 --> 2:31:07.560
 Within 45 minutes, the Secret Service

2:31:07.560 --> 2:31:09.800
 comes in, takes over that investigation.

2:31:09.800 --> 2:31:13.280
 They knew exactly who they had.

2:31:13.280 --> 2:31:16.720
 Along about 7 o clock at night, they're

2:31:16.720 --> 2:31:18.600
 like, we want to search your house.

2:31:18.600 --> 2:31:21.040
 And I was like, look, I'll sign off on the search

2:31:21.040 --> 2:31:23.760
 if you let me go with you so I can see her.

2:31:23.760 --> 2:31:27.240
 And they were like, OK.

2:31:27.240 --> 2:31:28.880
 So I got to see my phone at that point.

2:31:28.880 --> 2:31:32.880
 I had like 140 calls where she had

2:31:32.880 --> 2:31:34.480
 been trying to call all that time.

2:31:34.480 --> 2:31:35.440
 She was worried.

2:31:35.440 --> 2:31:36.640
 Yeah.

2:31:36.640 --> 2:31:40.000
 And so they load me up.

2:31:40.000 --> 2:31:45.520
 And hell, I mean, you talk about 10, 12 cars, 40 agents,

2:31:45.520 --> 2:31:46.520
 everything else.

2:31:46.520 --> 2:31:47.880
 She's got a dog at that point.

2:31:47.880 --> 2:31:49.640
 I'm scared they're going to shoot the dog.

2:31:49.640 --> 2:31:55.920
 And it was dark.

2:31:55.920 --> 2:31:57.160
 And they had me walk up.

2:31:57.160 --> 2:31:58.840
 And they're all behind me.

2:31:58.840 --> 2:32:01.640
 I knock on the door and tell her the police are there.

2:32:01.640 --> 2:32:03.840
 She needs to put the dog up.

2:32:03.840 --> 2:32:06.800
 So she does, and they come in and just

2:32:06.800 --> 2:32:09.600
 start ransacking them to put me in cuffs, set me down,

2:32:09.600 --> 2:32:11.360
 start berating her with questions.

2:32:11.360 --> 2:32:13.720
 She had no idea what the hell was going on.

2:32:13.720 --> 2:32:16.800
 Were you able to say a word or two to help her understand?

2:32:16.800 --> 2:32:18.160
 Yeah, I was trying to tell her.

2:32:18.160 --> 2:32:21.520
 And at the same time, they take a watch off her wrist.

2:32:21.520 --> 2:32:24.080
 They let her keep the ring.

2:32:24.080 --> 2:32:25.880
 They're telling her that I'm this guy.

2:32:25.880 --> 2:32:27.360
 What's my real name?

2:32:27.360 --> 2:32:29.480
 Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang across the board.

2:32:29.480 --> 2:32:31.000
 So she's probably terrified.

2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:31.720
 Oh, yeah.

2:32:31.720 --> 2:32:32.600
 Yeah.

2:32:32.600 --> 2:32:33.320
 Yeah.

2:32:33.320 --> 2:32:34.920
 And I tell her, I was like, look,

2:32:34.920 --> 2:32:36.320
 they're going to arraign me tomorrow.

2:32:36.320 --> 2:32:37.440
 Don't come.

2:32:37.440 --> 2:32:38.480
 Don't come.

2:32:38.480 --> 2:32:42.000
 I said, see what's going on, but don't show up.

2:32:42.000 --> 2:32:43.560
 Of course, she's there next morning.

2:32:43.560 --> 2:32:45.240
 Her and her dad.

2:32:45.240 --> 2:32:47.720
 And she's back in the back crying.

2:32:47.720 --> 2:32:49.520
 They're reading off the charges.

2:32:49.520 --> 2:32:55.520
 I'm under $300,000 bond, everything else.

2:32:55.520 --> 2:32:59.320
 And that's it.

2:32:59.320 --> 2:33:01.040
 They throw me in a cell.

2:33:01.040 --> 2:33:04.560
 Meanwhile, more charges keep coming in.

2:33:04.560 --> 2:33:10.280
 And it's like 10, 12 charges a day at that point.

2:33:10.280 --> 2:33:13.560
 And I'm trying to call her to make sure she's all right.

2:33:13.560 --> 2:33:16.600
 And does it get through?

2:33:16.600 --> 2:33:19.000
 So I spent three months in jail.

2:33:19.000 --> 2:33:21.520
 And during that three months, she visits twice.

2:33:21.520 --> 2:33:23.360
 I get like three or four phone calls to her.

2:33:26.160 --> 2:33:28.000
 Looking back now, I understand why.

2:33:28.000 --> 2:33:29.720
 Back then, it was like, I'm the victim.

2:33:29.720 --> 2:33:31.160
 Why doesn't she talk to me?

2:33:31.160 --> 2:33:35.160
 But now I understand why.

2:33:35.160 --> 2:33:37.240
 Hell, the girl loved me too.

2:33:37.240 --> 2:33:39.000
 She found out I was this piece of shit.

2:33:39.000 --> 2:33:44.040
 And after a week in county jail, two agents

2:33:44.040 --> 2:33:47.160
 fly in from New Jersey, two Secret Service guys.

2:33:47.160 --> 2:33:50.520
 Pulled me out of cell, looked at me, and they were like,

2:33:50.520 --> 2:33:51.400
 we've got your laptop.

2:33:51.400 --> 2:33:52.440
 And I was like, yeah.

2:33:52.440 --> 2:33:55.200
 And he's like, well, have you got anything on your laptop?

2:33:55.200 --> 2:33:56.160
 And I was like, yeah.

2:33:56.160 --> 2:33:57.560
 He's like, you're going to be charged for it.

2:33:57.560 --> 2:33:59.280
 I was like, I figured.

2:33:59.280 --> 2:34:01.760
 And then he looks at me, he's like,

2:34:01.760 --> 2:34:05.280
 can you do anything for us?

2:34:05.280 --> 2:34:07.240
 And I told him my exact words were, look,

2:34:07.240 --> 2:34:08.720
 you let me get back with Elizabeth.

2:34:08.720 --> 2:34:11.240
 I'll do whatever you want me to do.

2:34:11.240 --> 2:34:14.160
 And he looks at me, he's like, we're going to get you out.

2:34:14.160 --> 2:34:15.200
 I was like, all right.

2:34:15.200 --> 2:34:17.920
 So they let me sit there for three months

2:34:17.920 --> 2:34:21.960
 to get a taste of it and get me out.

2:34:21.960 --> 2:34:25.260
 My sister, they have the bond reduced to $1,000.

2:34:25.260 --> 2:34:27.200
 My sister pays the $1,000 bond.

2:34:27.200 --> 2:34:28.920
 By this point, she's disowned me.

2:34:28.920 --> 2:34:31.880
 And because I'm dating the stripper.

2:34:31.880 --> 2:34:36.000
 And Denise bonds me out.

2:34:36.000 --> 2:34:40.280
 The person that I call immediately is Elizabeth.

2:34:40.280 --> 2:34:41.240
 I'm out.

2:34:41.240 --> 2:34:43.480
 And she's like, I'll be there.

2:34:43.480 --> 2:34:44.680
 I was like, OK.

2:34:44.680 --> 2:34:49.120
 So it's like 11 o clock at night.

2:34:49.120 --> 2:34:53.520
 I'm in the parking lot of the Charleston County jail.

2:34:53.520 --> 2:34:55.960
 Me and a Secret Service agent standing there.

2:34:55.960 --> 2:34:58.800
 And Elizabeth had a friend that owned a limo company.

2:34:58.800 --> 2:35:04.640
 So she pulls up in a limo, gets out, pops the trunk,

2:35:04.640 --> 2:35:06.960
 gets these two plastic containers out

2:35:06.960 --> 2:35:12.560
 that have my clothes in them, drops them off the pavement,

2:35:12.560 --> 2:35:16.320
 comes over, hugs me, call me later.

2:35:16.320 --> 2:35:18.480
 Gets in the car, drives off.

2:35:18.480 --> 2:35:20.800
 I'm sitting there crying like a baby.

2:35:20.800 --> 2:35:23.260
 Agent looks at me, is that your fiancee?

2:35:23.260 --> 2:35:23.880
 I'm like, yeah.

2:35:23.880 --> 2:35:25.520
 And he's like, I am so sorry.

2:35:25.520 --> 2:35:28.320
 And I'm like, yeah.

2:35:28.320 --> 2:35:30.040
 I had to.

2:35:30.040 --> 2:35:32.360
 She sounds fascinating.

2:35:32.360 --> 2:35:33.200
 Pull up in a limo.

2:35:36.720 --> 2:35:40.200
 I had $30 in my name at that point, $30.

2:35:40.200 --> 2:35:43.920
 The agent had to pay for my hotel room that first night.

2:35:43.920 --> 2:35:45.840
 So he drops me off after paying for the hotel room,

2:35:45.840 --> 2:35:47.320
 buy me something to eat.

2:35:47.320 --> 2:35:50.280
 Soon as he drops me off, I take that $30,

2:35:50.280 --> 2:35:53.880
 walk a half mile to Walmart, buy a prepaid debit card

2:35:53.880 --> 2:35:56.080
 so I can start back in tax fraud.

2:35:56.080 --> 2:35:58.320
 Soon as I get back to the hotel room, call Elizabeth,

2:35:58.320 --> 2:36:00.480
 beg her to come see me.

2:36:00.480 --> 2:36:03.320
 She comes to see me, and we talk most of the night,

2:36:03.320 --> 2:36:05.580
 and convince her to give me a chance.

2:36:05.580 --> 2:36:07.920
 I tell her that everything's going to be all right.

2:36:07.920 --> 2:36:09.000
 They're going to hire me.

2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:11.080
 I'm going to be this big consultant.

2:36:11.080 --> 2:36:14.320
 Lies, lies, just so she'd get back with me.

2:36:14.320 --> 2:36:16.720
 And she's like, OK.

2:36:16.720 --> 2:36:20.600
 And so we move from Charleston.

2:36:20.600 --> 2:36:24.800
 The field office is in Columbia, South Carolina.

2:36:24.800 --> 2:36:27.800
 And I'm breaking the law.

2:36:27.800 --> 2:36:30.460
 Even before I start working with them, I'm breaking the law.

2:36:30.460 --> 2:36:34.680
 And so they've got me in the office, the field office.

2:36:34.680 --> 2:36:36.400
 They got this big war room in there.

2:36:36.400 --> 2:36:39.840
 I'm on a laptop, outside line, laptops hooked up

2:36:39.840 --> 2:36:43.240
 to a 50 inch plasma monitor on the wall.

2:36:43.240 --> 2:36:47.000
 They've got a desktop sitting directly next to me,

2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:50.640
 outside line, two Secret Service officers in the room

2:36:50.640 --> 2:36:54.960
 at all times with a South Carolina law enforcement officer.

2:36:54.960 --> 2:36:59.320
 My job is 46 hours a day, surfing the web,

2:36:59.320 --> 2:37:01.640
 picking up targets, intel, teaching them

2:37:01.640 --> 2:37:04.800
 how cybercrime operates, everything else like that.

2:37:04.800 --> 2:37:08.840
 For the first two weeks, they are extremely diligent.

2:37:08.840 --> 2:37:10.840
 They pay attention to everything that's going on,

2:37:10.840 --> 2:37:12.140
 ask questions, everything else.

2:37:12.140 --> 2:37:17.280
 But the problem is that that shit gets boring real quick,

2:37:17.280 --> 2:37:20.440
 because I'm very fast online doing that.

2:37:20.440 --> 2:37:22.600
 So they're like, what the hell is he doing?

2:37:22.600 --> 2:37:25.520
 And it gets tiring looking at a guy just doing that shit.

2:37:25.520 --> 2:37:28.960
 So after two weeks, they get lazy and bored.

2:37:28.960 --> 2:37:34.760
 And they start watching porn instead of watching me.

2:37:34.760 --> 2:37:37.240
 At the same time, they've got a keylogger.

2:37:37.240 --> 2:37:39.680
 And they've got Spectre Pro and Camtasia,

2:37:39.680 --> 2:37:43.840
 keyloggers and taking snapshots of everything that I'm doing.

2:37:43.840 --> 2:37:46.960
 Every night, it goes on a DVD rom on a spindle.

2:37:46.960 --> 2:37:51.840
 So I'm like, they're not going to go through that shit.

2:37:51.840 --> 2:37:53.600
 So I'm like, fuck it.

2:37:53.600 --> 2:37:55.840
 Start breaking the law from inside the Secret Service

2:37:55.840 --> 2:37:57.640
 offices while they're in the room.

2:37:57.640 --> 2:37:58.140
 Why not?

2:38:00.920 --> 2:38:03.800
 That continues for 10 months.

2:38:03.800 --> 2:38:06.880
 At the same time, the relationship with Elizabeth

2:38:06.880 --> 2:38:09.080
 fell apart, completely fell apart.

2:38:12.440 --> 2:38:14.680
 Do you have an understanding of why?

2:38:14.680 --> 2:38:18.320
 Because her heart got broken because there was lying.

2:38:18.320 --> 2:38:19.120
 It was the trust.

2:38:19.120 --> 2:38:23.360
 She felt like she did a lot to sacrifice for the relationship.

2:38:23.360 --> 2:38:33.080
 You've got a woman there that she had even said it.

2:38:33.080 --> 2:38:38.560
 She was like, she had told one of her friends

2:38:38.560 --> 2:38:41.360
 we were out having dinner one night.

2:38:41.360 --> 2:38:42.840
 And this was before I got arrested.

2:38:42.840 --> 2:38:47.320
 She told one of her friends that I was the only guy that ever

2:38:47.320 --> 2:38:49.800
 asked her to stop using drugs.

2:38:49.800 --> 2:38:51.080
 Yeah.

2:38:51.080 --> 2:38:52.120
 Yeah.

2:38:52.120 --> 2:38:57.920
 Yeah, I have to say that part of the story is so powerful.

2:38:57.920 --> 2:39:03.920
 And then that she chose to do it, and she chose to stop.

2:39:03.920 --> 2:39:07.880
 And she told me that there was one instance she told me

2:39:07.880 --> 2:39:10.880
 that if she didn't marry me, she'd never be married.

2:39:10.880 --> 2:39:15.800
 And as far as I know, she's never been married.

2:39:15.800 --> 2:39:17.800
 And so it started to fall apart there.

2:39:17.800 --> 2:39:23.640
 Yeah, because I was that piece of shit.

2:39:23.640 --> 2:39:25.520
 Still, you didn't take a step.

2:39:25.520 --> 2:39:29.600
 By the way, can I just say how just moving it is,

2:39:29.600 --> 2:39:30.440
 how honest you are.

2:39:30.440 --> 2:39:32.080
 But thank you.

2:39:32.080 --> 2:39:34.600
 Thank you for being that person.

2:39:34.600 --> 2:39:38.440
 But at that time, there's still that lying.

2:39:38.440 --> 2:39:39.320
 Oh, man, yeah.

2:39:39.320 --> 2:39:39.960
 Yeah.

2:39:39.960 --> 2:39:40.640
 Yeah.

2:39:40.640 --> 2:39:44.680
 So it's falling apart.

2:39:44.680 --> 2:39:46.640
 She wants to start going to strip clubs.

2:39:46.640 --> 2:39:49.280
 And I'm like, fuck it.

2:39:49.280 --> 2:39:50.120
 Why not?

2:39:50.120 --> 2:39:51.560
 We'll go.

2:39:51.560 --> 2:39:52.880
 So we start going to strip clubs,

2:39:52.880 --> 2:39:55.200
 and she'll come back and get wasted.

2:39:55.200 --> 2:39:58.000
 And we'll have sex, what have you.

2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:07.840
 And one night, she looks at me, and she was like,

2:40:07.840 --> 2:40:10.360
 I think it'd be funny if you got a blow job

2:40:10.360 --> 2:40:12.760
 from somebody else.

2:40:12.760 --> 2:40:15.960
 And that got me.

2:40:15.960 --> 2:40:16.520
 That got me.

2:40:16.520 --> 2:40:20.720
 I was like, to me, that was the final straw right there.

2:40:20.720 --> 2:40:23.800
 I was like, she doesn't care for me anymore or anything else

2:40:23.800 --> 2:40:25.480
 like that.

2:40:25.480 --> 2:40:27.600
 We've been going to strip clubs, so I

2:40:27.600 --> 2:40:29.160
 started dating another stripper.

2:40:29.160 --> 2:40:33.760
 And she knew something was going on.

2:40:33.760 --> 2:40:37.080
 And she looks at me one day, and she's like,

2:40:37.080 --> 2:40:39.040
 why don't you just tell me that it's over?

2:40:39.040 --> 2:40:41.080
 And I looked at her, and I said, it's over.

2:40:41.080 --> 2:40:42.160
 We're done.

2:40:42.160 --> 2:40:48.360
 And I told her, I was like, look, I said, whatever you want.

2:40:48.360 --> 2:40:49.560
 We were renting an apartment.

2:40:49.560 --> 2:40:53.000
 I was like, whatever you want in here, take it.

2:40:53.000 --> 2:40:58.400
 And I said, not only that, but I'll

2:40:58.400 --> 2:41:02.840
 make sure you got money for several months

2:41:02.840 --> 2:41:04.160
 so you're all right.

2:41:04.160 --> 2:41:07.280
 And I was like, just leave me my TV

2:41:07.280 --> 2:41:11.680
 and leave me some plates and stuff.

2:41:11.680 --> 2:41:15.000
 So I go to work that day at the Secret Service,

2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:19.320
 come back that night, and she's taken everything

2:41:19.320 --> 2:41:22.800
 and left a picture of herself in the bedroom on the floor.

2:41:22.800 --> 2:41:26.960
 I'm like, OK, I guess I deserve that.

2:41:26.960 --> 2:41:28.680
 She's got, I like her.

2:41:28.680 --> 2:41:29.880
 She's got a sense of humor.

2:41:29.880 --> 2:41:30.840
 Yeah, she was cool.

2:41:30.840 --> 2:41:33.240
 She was cool.

2:41:33.240 --> 2:41:36.600
 I'm giving her $1,000 every two weeks

2:41:36.600 --> 2:41:37.640
 or some shit like that.

2:41:37.640 --> 2:41:40.400
 And it gets to the point, because I'm

2:41:40.400 --> 2:41:43.520
 doing this tax fraud from inside the offices.

2:41:43.520 --> 2:41:47.640
 Well, the debit card companies are pinging the cards.

2:41:47.640 --> 2:41:49.720
 They start to realize that, hey, some son of a bitch

2:41:49.720 --> 2:41:51.840
 is stealing money using our debit card.

2:41:51.840 --> 2:41:53.280
 So they start to shut down the cards

2:41:53.280 --> 2:41:54.920
 before I can pull cash out.

2:41:54.920 --> 2:41:57.320
 So I start not to have the money to send to her.

2:41:57.320 --> 2:42:01.400
 And I'm like, so she calls, and she's like, look,

2:42:01.400 --> 2:42:02.920
 I have to have money.

2:42:02.920 --> 2:42:05.800
 And I was like, well, look, I'm doing what I can.

2:42:05.800 --> 2:42:06.760
 You promised money.

2:42:06.760 --> 2:42:08.120
 And I was like, look, if you knew

2:42:08.120 --> 2:42:10.000
 what I was doing to get this money,

2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:11.600
 you wouldn't be asking that.

2:42:11.600 --> 2:42:13.960
 And she's like, I need money.

2:42:13.960 --> 2:42:16.560
 My rent's behind by a month right now.

2:42:16.560 --> 2:42:18.040
 And I'm like, your rent's behind?

2:42:18.040 --> 2:42:18.760
 She's like, yeah.

2:42:18.760 --> 2:42:21.760
 So I was like, OK, so I pick up the phone,

2:42:21.760 --> 2:42:23.360
 call the rental office.

2:42:23.360 --> 2:42:27.360
 And I was like, I just want to make sure that I'm sorry

2:42:27.360 --> 2:42:29.720
 I'm behind on the rent for this apartment number.

2:42:29.720 --> 2:42:33.440
 Oh, no, that rent's paid up three months.

2:42:33.440 --> 2:42:35.720
 It's like, OK, hang up, call Elizabeth back.

2:42:35.720 --> 2:42:38.040
 I was like, you're behind on the rent.

2:42:38.040 --> 2:42:39.440
 And she was like, yeah.

2:42:39.440 --> 2:42:42.280
 And I was like, funny, they just said

2:42:42.280 --> 2:42:43.440
 you're up on it three months.

2:42:43.440 --> 2:42:47.480
 And she gets quiet, and she's like, well, you lied to me, too.

2:42:47.480 --> 2:42:50.520
 And I was like, you're right.

2:42:50.520 --> 2:42:51.200
 I did.

2:42:51.200 --> 2:42:52.440
 I did that.

2:42:52.440 --> 2:42:54.640
 I was like, but look, I can't do it anymore.

2:42:54.640 --> 2:43:00.320
 And that's the last time I spoke to her right there.

2:43:00.320 --> 2:43:05.960
 What happens is I was breaking law

2:43:05.960 --> 2:43:07.440
 from inside the offices.

2:43:07.440 --> 2:43:12.560
 I had a buddy that his name was Sean Mims out of Los Angeles.

2:43:12.560 --> 2:43:16.480
 I had taught him how to do tax return fraud.

2:43:16.480 --> 2:43:19.320
 I had told Sean, I go missing, I go missing for three months.

2:43:19.320 --> 2:43:22.280
 I told him if I ever went missing not to contact me.

2:43:22.280 --> 2:43:26.760
 And so I go missing, then I show back up online.

2:43:26.760 --> 2:43:28.360
 First day, he contacts.

2:43:28.360 --> 2:43:29.880
 So he becomes a target.

2:43:29.880 --> 2:43:33.200
 And they identify him pretty quickly at that point.

2:43:33.200 --> 2:43:38.560
 He's set to be arrested sometime in March of six.

2:43:38.560 --> 2:43:40.880
 That's when he's set to be arrested.

2:43:40.880 --> 2:43:43.160
 Operation Rolling Stone was the name of the operation.

2:43:43.160 --> 2:43:45.800
 Nine people were supposed to be arrested that night.

2:43:45.800 --> 2:43:50.120
 So Secret Service goes and arrests this guy.

2:43:50.120 --> 2:43:53.720
 They search his apartment and don't find anything.

2:43:53.720 --> 2:43:56.400
 The apartment manager comes out and explains to him

2:43:56.400 --> 2:43:58.440
 how Sean has done all kinds of work to the apartment.

2:43:58.440 --> 2:44:03.480
 As a matter of fact, he brought in $30,000 worth of Italian tile

2:44:03.480 --> 2:44:06.000
 to put in the apartment that he's renting.

2:44:06.000 --> 2:44:09.440
 And by the way, last night he had a UHaul out here

2:44:09.440 --> 2:44:11.760
 and took out a whole shitload of stuff.

2:44:11.760 --> 2:44:15.640
 So Secret Service comes back in.

2:44:15.640 --> 2:44:17.040
 They look at me and they're like, we

2:44:17.040 --> 2:44:19.440
 need you to take a polygraph.

2:44:19.440 --> 2:44:22.880
 And my answer was, I ain't taking a polygraph.

2:44:22.880 --> 2:44:25.000
 So they're like, well, we'll throw you back in jail

2:44:25.000 --> 2:44:25.400
 if you don't.

2:44:25.400 --> 2:44:26.640
 And I was like, call my lawyer.

2:44:26.640 --> 2:44:27.880
 Lawyer gets me on the phone.

2:44:27.880 --> 2:44:30.400
 He's like, you don't have to take the polygraph.

2:44:30.400 --> 2:44:32.200
 I was like, well, good, I'm not going to.

2:44:32.200 --> 2:44:33.920
 But they will throw you back in jail.

2:44:33.920 --> 2:44:35.840
 And I was like, don't want to do that.

2:44:35.840 --> 2:44:39.000
 And he's like, have you done anything?

2:44:39.000 --> 2:44:41.160
 And I was like, yeah.

2:44:41.160 --> 2:44:46.640
 And he's like, well, you can try to pass the polygraph.

2:44:46.640 --> 2:44:48.080
 I'm like, OK.

2:44:48.080 --> 2:44:49.040
 So I slipped out.

2:44:49.040 --> 2:44:51.200
 I was like, let's take the polygraph.

2:44:51.200 --> 2:44:52.360
 They asked three questions.

2:44:52.360 --> 2:44:56.360
 The questions were, have you talked to anybody?

2:44:56.360 --> 2:44:58.920
 Have you been on a computer outside of the offices?

2:44:58.920 --> 2:45:00.600
 Have you talked to the press, which

2:45:00.600 --> 2:45:02.280
 I was interviewing with a New York Times

2:45:02.280 --> 2:45:03.720
 writer the entire time?

2:45:03.720 --> 2:45:05.880
 And then have you contacted or warned anybody

2:45:05.880 --> 2:45:07.080
 about investigations?

2:45:07.080 --> 2:45:09.560
 And I failed polygraph completely.

2:45:09.560 --> 2:45:12.800
 So they revoked the bond, took me back down

2:45:12.800 --> 2:45:15.960
 to Charleston County, throw me into jail.

2:45:15.960 --> 2:45:19.760
 Three days later, Secret Service shows back up

2:45:19.760 --> 2:45:21.400
 and pulled me out of a cell.

2:45:21.400 --> 2:45:23.320
 It's Jim Ramacone and Bobby Kirby.

2:45:23.320 --> 2:45:27.240
 And I mean, honestly, they were good men.

2:45:27.240 --> 2:45:30.920
 And they gave me chances upon chances to do the right thing.

2:45:30.920 --> 2:45:33.560
 And I was not ready to do that.

2:45:33.560 --> 2:45:36.640
 And Jim Ramacone and Bobby's in there.

2:45:36.640 --> 2:45:39.240
 And Bobby, I mean, Bobby was a friend.

2:45:39.240 --> 2:45:40.520
 I mean, he truly was.

2:45:40.520 --> 2:45:50.520
 Later on, a couple of years ago, I had a chance to have lunch

2:45:50.520 --> 2:45:51.320
 with a man.

2:45:51.320 --> 2:45:55.080
 And I told him I was sorry for everything I did to him

2:45:55.080 --> 2:45:58.000
 because I got him and another agent fired.

2:45:58.000 --> 2:46:01.320
 And I told him I was sorry for what happened.

2:46:01.320 --> 2:46:05.320
 And he told me then, he's like, we were your friends, man.

2:46:05.320 --> 2:46:07.200
 We were truly your friends.

2:46:07.200 --> 2:46:08.200
 So they were good men.

2:46:08.200 --> 2:46:09.080
 They wanted to help.

2:46:09.080 --> 2:46:10.360
 Yeah.

2:46:10.360 --> 2:46:12.440
 They wanted you to be a good man.

2:46:12.440 --> 2:46:13.800
 Yeah.

2:46:13.800 --> 2:46:17.240
 What got me so damn bad is I told him,

2:46:17.240 --> 2:46:19.400
 I was like, man, I'm trying to be a better guy.

2:46:19.400 --> 2:46:22.560
 And he's like, Brett, you always were a good guy.

2:46:22.560 --> 2:46:24.640
 You just didn't know it.

2:46:24.640 --> 2:46:25.120
 Fuck.

2:46:25.120 --> 2:46:28.120
 People like that, we need people like that in this world.

2:46:28.120 --> 2:46:30.080
 Yeah.

2:46:30.080 --> 2:46:33.760
 You need somebody to basically believe that you

2:46:33.760 --> 2:46:35.360
 can be a good man.

2:46:35.360 --> 2:46:37.200
 So Jim Ramacone pulls me out.

2:46:37.200 --> 2:46:39.560
 He's the second in charge in South Carolina.

2:46:39.560 --> 2:46:43.240
 He's got the Miranda waiver in front of him, right?

2:46:43.240 --> 2:46:43.960
 And he looks at me.

2:46:43.960 --> 2:46:45.840
 He's like, I'm playing hard ass.

2:46:45.840 --> 2:46:49.440
 Bobby's over here looking distraught and like a hurt dog.

2:46:49.440 --> 2:46:52.840
 And Jim's like, here's the way this is going to work.

2:46:52.840 --> 2:46:55.320
 He said, you're going to tell me everything you've done

2:46:55.320 --> 2:46:58.440
 the past six years, or I'm going to make it my mission in life

2:46:58.440 --> 2:47:01.440
 to fuck over you and your family.

2:47:01.440 --> 2:47:03.520
 And he said, not just this case.

2:47:03.520 --> 2:47:05.840
 Once you get out of prison, I'll hound you

2:47:05.840 --> 2:47:07.200
 the rest of your life.

2:47:07.200 --> 2:47:09.080
 Then he slides the Miranda waiver over,

2:47:09.080 --> 2:47:11.600
 and he's like, now you want to talk?

2:47:11.600 --> 2:47:15.960
 And I looked at him, and I was like, nope.

2:47:15.960 --> 2:47:19.360
 He was like, he gets up, gets all red in the face,

2:47:19.360 --> 2:47:20.920
 storms out on the way out.

2:47:20.920 --> 2:47:23.320
 He's like, fuck you very much.

2:47:23.320 --> 2:47:24.800
 So I go back to the cell.

2:47:24.800 --> 2:47:28.360
 A week later, I was only under state charges.

2:47:28.360 --> 2:47:33.840
 A week later, judge rules they revoke the bond improperly.

2:47:33.840 --> 2:47:36.440
 Wow.

2:47:36.440 --> 2:47:37.860
 Reinstates the bond.

2:47:37.860 --> 2:47:42.280
 Nobody calls the Secret Service to tell them I walk out.

2:47:42.280 --> 2:47:43.000
 I walk out.

2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:46.600
 I was dating this stripper, and I told my mom.

2:47:46.600 --> 2:47:49.160
 I was like, well, if they're going to fuck me,

2:47:49.160 --> 2:47:52.320
 they're going to have to find me.

2:47:52.320 --> 2:47:53.600
 She just went on the move.

2:47:53.600 --> 2:47:55.440
 Yeah, I called this stripper girl up.

2:47:55.440 --> 2:47:58.600
 I'd given her like 60K, some bullshit like that.

2:47:58.600 --> 2:48:01.920
 And I told her, I was like, Kim, I need some money.

2:48:01.920 --> 2:48:03.400
 And she was like, what?

2:48:03.400 --> 2:48:06.040
 I was like, look, I said, give me $1,000.

2:48:06.040 --> 2:48:08.260
 I'll give you back $3,000 in two weeks.

2:48:08.260 --> 2:48:09.000
 She was like, OK.

2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:11.800
 So I met her in Augusta, Georgia,

2:48:11.800 --> 2:48:16.640
 and got the $1,000 from her and started driving west on I20.

2:48:16.640 --> 2:48:18.520
 No idea where to go to, anything else.

2:48:18.520 --> 2:48:20.400
 Got to Dallas.

2:48:20.400 --> 2:48:23.120
 There was a prepaid debit card supplier in Dallas.

2:48:23.120 --> 2:48:26.560
 Went in, walked in the office, convinced the guy,

2:48:26.560 --> 2:48:27.960
 social engineering, convinced the guy

2:48:27.960 --> 2:48:30.280
 to give me 60 prepaid debit cards without a driver's

2:48:30.280 --> 2:48:33.120
 license, without payment, anything else he did.

2:48:33.120 --> 2:48:35.320
 And that started the run.

2:48:35.320 --> 2:48:36.360
 I ended up stealing.

2:48:36.360 --> 2:48:39.040
 From that, I stole like 160K profit,

2:48:39.040 --> 2:48:41.080
 used that to buy a Jeep Cherokee.

2:48:41.080 --> 2:48:43.920
 And the idea was to steal enough money

2:48:43.920 --> 2:48:47.280
 to bug out to Florianopolis, Brazil,

2:48:47.280 --> 2:48:51.720
 and set up shop down there, and do it again.

2:48:51.720 --> 2:48:52.600
 That was the dream.

2:48:52.600 --> 2:48:53.120
 That was it.

2:48:53.120 --> 2:48:53.680
 That was it.

2:48:53.680 --> 2:48:58.320
 So I was on the run for four months, stole $600,000.

2:48:58.320 --> 2:49:00.000
 I was in Las Vegas, Nevada.

2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:02.120
 One day, I had stolen the night before.

2:49:02.120 --> 2:49:05.280
 I had stolen 160K out of ATMs.

2:49:05.280 --> 2:49:06.840
 Went in the next morning.

2:49:06.840 --> 2:49:09.520
 I woke up, signed on to cartersmarket.com,

2:49:09.520 --> 2:49:12.720
 which was ran by Max Butler, the ice man.

2:49:12.720 --> 2:49:16.000
 And there's my name, US Most Wanted on it.

2:49:16.000 --> 2:49:18.960
 And that gets your attention.

2:49:18.960 --> 2:49:21.320
 That was my real name with the US Most Wanted beside of it.

2:49:21.320 --> 2:49:24.000
 Nobody knew my real name in that environment at all.

2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:25.160
 But then they did.

2:49:25.160 --> 2:49:26.640
 And it was talking about me being

2:49:26.640 --> 2:49:29.720
 part of the Secret Service, Operation Anglerfish,

2:49:29.720 --> 2:49:31.280
 everything else.

2:49:31.280 --> 2:49:33.920
 So of course, they're all like, everybody's after you.

2:49:33.920 --> 2:49:36.760
 They're like, oh, yeah, we're going to get this son of a bitch.

2:49:36.760 --> 2:49:38.160
 So I sat there looking at it.

2:49:38.160 --> 2:49:39.520
 And I was like, said it out loud.

2:49:39.520 --> 2:49:41.060
 I was like, well, Mr. Johnson, you've

2:49:41.060 --> 2:49:42.920
 made the United States Most Wanted list.

2:49:42.920 --> 2:49:44.120
 What do you do now?

2:49:44.120 --> 2:49:47.760
 And I was like, I'm going to Disney World.

2:49:47.760 --> 2:49:48.480
 Literally.

2:49:48.480 --> 2:49:49.240
 Literally.

2:49:49.240 --> 2:49:49.880
 Literally.

2:49:49.880 --> 2:49:51.760
 Said that out loud.

2:49:51.760 --> 2:49:54.280
 So loaded up the Jeep, drove from Las Vegas

2:49:54.280 --> 2:49:59.760
 to Orlando, Florida, and got the two annual passes,

2:49:59.760 --> 2:50:02.920
 one to Disney World, the other one to Universal Studios.

2:50:02.920 --> 2:50:05.120
 Paid for a timeshare.

2:50:05.120 --> 2:50:07.680
 They were building these new timeshares right off

2:50:07.680 --> 2:50:10.760
 Universal Drive, building these brand new timeshares,

2:50:10.760 --> 2:50:13.800
 paid for a timeshare in nine months, cash.

2:50:13.800 --> 2:50:15.000
 I was like, we take cash?

2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:15.920
 Yeah, we take cash.

2:50:15.920 --> 2:50:18.040
 There's $12,900.

2:50:18.040 --> 2:50:19.200
 Then it wasn't furnished.

2:50:19.200 --> 2:50:20.760
 So I went down to a furniture store,

2:50:20.760 --> 2:50:22.920
 bought $30,000 in furniture.

2:50:22.920 --> 2:50:27.080
 They had seized a DVD collection of mine worth $30,000,

2:50:27.080 --> 2:50:31.400
 bought that back, and proceeded to go to Disney World

2:50:31.400 --> 2:50:32.040
 every day.

2:50:32.040 --> 2:50:35.360
 And that lasted about six weeks.

2:50:35.360 --> 2:50:37.800
 They used a trigger fish, is what they use.

2:50:37.800 --> 2:50:42.040
 Nowadays, it's called a stingray to find me.

2:50:42.040 --> 2:50:45.440
 So one day, it was like 1030 in the morning on Saturday.

2:50:45.440 --> 2:50:48.400
 September 16 was the day, 2006.

2:50:48.400 --> 2:50:50.960
 Yeah, 2006, September 16.

2:50:50.960 --> 2:50:54.080
 I was used to the builders coming around knocking,

2:50:54.080 --> 2:50:55.960
 making sure everything was all right.

2:50:55.960 --> 2:50:59.240
 So I was asleep, heard this knock at the door,

2:50:59.240 --> 2:51:02.160
 and get up, look through the keyhole, nobody's there.

2:51:02.160 --> 2:51:03.600
 You know, people, nobody's there.

2:51:03.600 --> 2:51:04.720
 I was like, huh.

2:51:04.720 --> 2:51:06.960
 Open the door, step out into the hallway.

2:51:06.960 --> 2:51:09.800
 Walking down the hall is Bobby Kirby,

2:51:09.800 --> 2:51:14.680
 another South Carolina guy and a Orlando Orange County cop.

2:51:14.680 --> 2:51:17.720
 And they turn around, and they're like, hey, Brett.

2:51:17.720 --> 2:51:19.400
 And I'm like, hey, Bobby, how are you?

2:51:19.400 --> 2:51:20.960
 And it's like, we're good, how are you?

2:51:20.960 --> 2:51:23.400
 And I'm like, I'm fine, would you like to come in?

2:51:23.400 --> 2:51:25.560
 He was like, let's put you in cuffs first.

2:51:25.560 --> 2:51:28.840
 And I was like, that's probably a good idea.

2:51:28.840 --> 2:51:33.040
 He was like, he walks in, he's like,

2:51:33.040 --> 2:51:34.600
 have you got anything in here?

2:51:34.600 --> 2:51:37.400
 And I was like, yeah, there's $120,000 in the bedroom.

2:51:37.400 --> 2:51:39.080
 And he was like, seriously?

2:51:39.080 --> 2:51:42.160
 I was like, yeah, that and an AK 47.

2:51:42.160 --> 2:51:44.680
 His face goes white, and he's like, you've got a rifle?

2:51:44.680 --> 2:51:48.880
 And I was like, no, I'm kidding with you.

2:51:48.880 --> 2:51:50.760
 He was like, OK.

2:51:50.760 --> 2:51:54.080
 So they throw me in jail in Orange County,

2:51:54.080 --> 2:51:57.280
 and they give me diesel therapy.

2:51:57.280 --> 2:52:01.560
 And diesel therapy is, it took like two weeks

2:52:01.560 --> 2:52:04.800
 to transport me from Orange County, Orlando,

2:52:04.800 --> 2:52:06.480
 to Columbia, South Carolina.

2:52:06.480 --> 2:52:08.760
 And what happens is, is you stop at every county jail

2:52:08.760 --> 2:52:11.560
 you possibly can, go through the processing, which

2:52:11.560 --> 2:52:13.160
 is about six hours.

2:52:13.160 --> 2:52:18.080
 Once you get to your bunk, hey, time to transport you.

2:52:18.080 --> 2:52:19.880
 They do that on purpose?

2:52:19.880 --> 2:52:21.600
 On purpose, on purpose.

2:52:21.600 --> 2:52:24.760
 Wears you down mentally and physically and everything.

2:52:24.760 --> 2:52:26.880
 I get to Columbia, South Carolina.

2:52:26.880 --> 2:52:29.800
 Now, while I was at Orange County, what happens is,

2:52:29.800 --> 2:52:32.680
 this inmate, because we were in federal holding,

2:52:32.680 --> 2:52:33.800
 this inmate, he looks at me.

2:52:33.800 --> 2:52:35.200
 His name was Yeti.

2:52:35.200 --> 2:52:36.520
 And he's like, hey, man, you know,

2:52:36.520 --> 2:52:38.960
 the only time you get off in federal prison

2:52:38.960 --> 2:52:40.480
 is the drug program.

2:52:40.480 --> 2:52:42.320
 I was like, well, man, I don't use drugs.

2:52:42.320 --> 2:52:45.600
 And he's like, you can find a drug problem, can't you?

2:52:45.600 --> 2:52:48.800
 And I was like, I can find a drug problem.

2:52:48.800 --> 2:52:51.560
 So what happens is, is every county jail I stop at

2:52:51.560 --> 2:52:56.800
 on the way to Columbia, I tell them I'm alcoholic and cocaine.

2:52:56.800 --> 2:52:58.840
 So by the time I get to Columbia, South Carolina,

2:52:58.840 --> 2:53:00.760
 they've got this paper trail of Mr. Johnson

2:53:00.760 --> 2:53:02.080
 requesting help for drugs.

2:53:04.760 --> 2:53:09.960
 I had hired Strom Thurmond's son as an attorney.

2:53:09.960 --> 2:53:12.120
 They make me drop him because I paid for him

2:53:12.120 --> 2:53:13.440
 with illegal funds.

2:53:13.440 --> 2:53:15.880
 So they give me a public defender.

2:53:15.880 --> 2:53:19.920
 He gets a psychological evaluation order for me.

2:53:19.920 --> 2:53:22.640
 So psychologist comes in county jail, four hour interview.

2:53:22.640 --> 2:53:24.200
 About halfway through, he looks at me,

2:53:24.200 --> 2:53:25.800
 he's like, you using these type of drugs?

2:53:25.800 --> 2:53:26.840
 I was like, yeah.

2:53:26.840 --> 2:53:27.680
 What do you use?

2:53:27.680 --> 2:53:28.400
 Cocaine.

2:53:28.400 --> 2:53:29.400
 Smoke or snort?

2:53:29.400 --> 2:53:29.920
 Snort.

2:53:29.920 --> 2:53:30.400
 How much?

2:53:30.400 --> 2:53:32.480
 An eight ball a day.

2:53:32.480 --> 2:53:33.080
 That's a lot.

2:53:33.080 --> 2:53:34.240
 Yeah.

2:53:34.240 --> 2:53:36.280
 Do you have any trouble out of that?

2:53:36.280 --> 2:53:37.960
 Yeah.

2:53:37.960 --> 2:53:40.080
 I can't get an erection.

2:53:40.080 --> 2:53:41.320
 And he looks at me.

2:53:41.320 --> 2:53:44.440
 And I'm looking at him like, because I had gotten

2:53:44.440 --> 2:53:46.000
 that shit from Boogie Nights.

2:53:49.520 --> 2:53:51.840
 Finally, I'm like, is that right?

2:53:51.840 --> 2:53:54.320
 And he was like, it could happen.

2:53:54.320 --> 2:53:57.040
 I was like, OK.

2:53:57.040 --> 2:54:00.960
 That makes it into my pre sentence report.

2:54:00.960 --> 2:54:03.680
 So all federal inmates, probation office

2:54:03.680 --> 2:54:07.080
 and prosecutor, they do this detailed background check

2:54:07.080 --> 2:54:09.880
 to basically tell the judge how much time to give you.

2:54:09.880 --> 2:54:14.640
 So that drug bit with that interview makes it into the PSR.

2:54:14.640 --> 2:54:17.840
 So day of interview, I mean, day of sentencing.

2:54:17.840 --> 2:54:21.280
 I had pled guilty, day of sentencing.

2:54:21.280 --> 2:54:24.640
 The prosecutor, he stands up, and this dude

2:54:24.640 --> 2:54:26.640
 is screaming at this point.

2:54:26.640 --> 2:54:28.880
 And he's like, Mr. Johnson's manipulated

2:54:28.880 --> 2:54:30.120
 the Secret Service.

2:54:30.120 --> 2:54:31.640
 He's manipulated the prosecutor.

2:54:31.640 --> 2:54:33.160
 Then he points at the judge.

2:54:33.160 --> 2:54:35.600
 And he's manipulating you today, Your Honor.

2:54:35.600 --> 2:54:38.400
 We insist on the upper limits of the guidelines.

2:54:38.400 --> 2:54:40.480
 Well, I've been telling everybody in the jail

2:54:40.480 --> 2:54:43.240
 that if they give me any more than 60 months,

2:54:43.240 --> 2:54:45.000
 I am not staying.

2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:47.880
 So we're like, OK, sure.

2:54:47.880 --> 2:54:50.400
 So the judge looks at me.

2:54:50.400 --> 2:54:51.760
 She's like, I agree.

2:54:51.760 --> 2:54:55.040
 I'm like, she says, 75 months.

2:54:55.040 --> 2:54:57.600
 So I looked at my lawyer, and I was like,

2:54:57.600 --> 2:54:59.400
 can you get the drug program for me?

2:54:59.400 --> 2:55:00.760
 He's like, I don't know why I ask.

2:55:00.760 --> 2:55:02.920
 So he stands up.

2:55:02.920 --> 2:55:05.520
 Your Honor, will you order the drug program for Mr. Johnson?

2:55:05.520 --> 2:55:09.320
 The judge says, no, but I'll recommend he gets evaluated.

2:55:09.320 --> 2:55:12.960
 So the Secret Service had told her, hey, he's full of shit.

2:55:12.960 --> 2:55:15.000
 So she's like, no, but I'll recommend he gets evaluated.

2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:16.960
 I looked at my lawyer, and I was like, what does that mean?

2:55:16.960 --> 2:55:19.000
 He was like, you're probably not going to get it.

2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:22.160
 I'm like, how soon can you get me to the camp?

2:55:22.160 --> 2:55:24.760
 And he was like, well, if you don't appeal,

2:55:24.760 --> 2:55:26.200
 I can get you there pretty quick.

2:55:26.200 --> 2:55:29.080
 My exact words were, fuck the appeal.

2:55:29.080 --> 2:55:30.320
 Get me to the camp.

2:55:30.320 --> 2:55:31.800
 I'll take it from there.

2:55:31.800 --> 2:55:35.400
 He looks at me like I'm the biggest idiot in the world.

2:55:35.400 --> 2:55:38.400
 I get sent to, because you can get a camp recommended.

2:55:38.400 --> 2:55:41.360
 I have friends, family members look

2:55:41.360 --> 2:55:43.760
 for camps that don't have a fence around them.

2:55:43.760 --> 2:55:47.120
 And we settle on Ashland, Kentucky.

2:55:47.120 --> 2:55:49.120
 Six weeks later, I'm in Ashland, Kentucky,

2:55:49.120 --> 2:55:53.960
 and pull up there, 14 foot fence, a razor wire on top.

2:55:53.960 --> 2:55:58.720
 And I'm like, I don't climb fences, so I go in.

2:55:58.720 --> 2:56:01.120
 First question I ask is, are there any jobs

2:56:01.120 --> 2:56:02.160
 outside of the fence?

2:56:02.160 --> 2:56:04.080
 And he was like, guards like, well, you

2:56:04.080 --> 2:56:05.560
 can work in the national forest.

2:56:05.560 --> 2:56:07.640
 And I'm like, no, I'll die out there.

2:56:07.640 --> 2:56:09.680
 He was like, well, you could do landscaping.

2:56:09.680 --> 2:56:13.320
 I'm like, I can run a weed eater.

2:56:13.320 --> 2:56:16.920
 Two days later, I walk into the landscaping office,

2:56:16.920 --> 2:56:19.520
 and the cop, this is this genius of some

2:56:19.520 --> 2:56:21.160
 of these people and institutions.

2:56:21.160 --> 2:56:25.480
 The cop, behind his desk, the entire wall

2:56:25.480 --> 2:56:29.720
 is a blown up photo of the compound and the outlying area.

2:56:29.720 --> 2:56:35.000
 So I can literally sit there and plot where I'm going.

2:56:35.000 --> 2:56:40.520
 My dad, I hadn't spoken to that man in years.

2:56:40.520 --> 2:56:44.800
 And he shows up at my sentencing and stands up

2:56:44.800 --> 2:56:45.720
 in front of the judge.

2:56:45.720 --> 2:56:47.560
 And he's like, Your Honor, I want to make

2:56:47.560 --> 2:56:49.680
 sure Brett gets a good start.

2:56:49.680 --> 2:56:52.680
 He can live with me when he gets out, everything else.

2:56:52.680 --> 2:56:54.720
 Looking back, the man meant that.

2:56:54.720 --> 2:56:58.240
 And I just thought it was bullshit at the time.

2:56:58.240 --> 2:57:00.560
 So he starts to visit me in prison.

2:57:00.560 --> 2:57:02.320
 I mean, yeah, in prison, he starts to visit.

2:57:02.320 --> 2:57:05.120
 And about the third visit in, he looks at me.

2:57:05.120 --> 2:57:07.720
 He's like, I've been reading about you online.

2:57:07.720 --> 2:57:08.200
 I was like, yeah.

2:57:08.200 --> 2:57:09.480
 He's like, yeah.

2:57:09.480 --> 2:57:11.240
 He's like, that's a lot of money you made.

2:57:11.240 --> 2:57:12.520
 And I was like, yeah.

2:57:12.520 --> 2:57:15.440
 He's like, you think you can teach somebody

2:57:15.440 --> 2:57:16.200
 how to do that?

2:57:16.200 --> 2:57:21.640
 And I'm like, so what I used to say,

2:57:21.640 --> 2:57:25.000
 and again, it's this thing of really coming

2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:26.120
 to terms with things.

2:57:26.120 --> 2:57:31.800
 What I used to say was I thought my dad was back in my life

2:57:31.800 --> 2:57:35.080
 and that he was just trying to use me.

2:57:35.080 --> 2:57:38.000
 The truth of the matter was is that my dad

2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:43.360
 hadn't really seen me except in that frame of crime,

2:57:43.360 --> 2:57:46.600
 being that criminal with my mom, everything else.

2:57:46.600 --> 2:57:48.280
 I really think that's how the man was trying

2:57:48.280 --> 2:57:50.000
 to communicate with me.

2:57:50.000 --> 2:57:52.040
 He wanted to connect with you in the places

2:57:52.040 --> 2:57:54.840
 where you know, where you love, where you're interested in,

2:57:54.840 --> 2:57:56.440
 where your addiction is, essentially.

2:57:56.440 --> 2:58:00.000
 And what I did is I manipulated the man

2:58:00.000 --> 2:58:01.920
 into helping me escape.

2:58:01.920 --> 2:58:04.240
 So I agreed to teach him how to do tax fraud.

2:58:04.240 --> 2:58:06.840
 And in return, the only money he had to his name,

2:58:06.840 --> 2:58:09.080
 he had $4,000 cash.

2:58:09.080 --> 2:58:11.280
 So I manipulated him into giving me that

2:58:11.280 --> 2:58:13.840
 and to dropping me off a change of clothes, a cell phone,

2:58:13.840 --> 2:58:14.840
 and a driver's license.

2:58:14.840 --> 2:58:17.040
 The only driver's license he had was my driver's license,

2:58:17.040 --> 2:58:18.360
 Brett Johnson.

2:58:18.360 --> 2:58:22.720
 So I was at the camp for, I don't know, six, eight weeks.

2:58:22.720 --> 2:58:26.840
 And the hardest worker that landscaping had ever seen.

2:58:26.840 --> 2:58:29.720
 At one point, the cops got me on a mountainside

2:58:29.720 --> 2:58:31.680
 with a broom, sweeping off the mountain.

2:58:31.680 --> 2:58:34.160
 I'm like, yeah, we'll do that, absolutely.

2:58:34.160 --> 2:58:36.160
 So you're building trust with the guys there.

2:58:36.160 --> 2:58:37.480
 Yeah, working my ass off.

2:58:37.480 --> 2:58:39.720
 And in six weeks, I take off.

2:58:39.720 --> 2:58:42.920
 And I lasted, I think, two, three weeks, something

2:58:42.920 --> 2:58:43.680
 like that.

2:58:43.680 --> 2:58:45.000
 US Marshals, I made it 100.

2:58:45.000 --> 2:58:45.960
 They called you escaped.

2:58:45.960 --> 2:58:46.680
 Yeah, escaped.

2:58:46.680 --> 2:58:47.600
 Escaped.

2:58:47.600 --> 2:58:50.120
 US Marshals, they're canvassing a three state area.

2:58:50.120 --> 2:58:52.000
 They found me, I think, 250 miles away.

2:58:52.000 --> 2:58:53.800
 It's like Lexington, Kentucky.

2:58:53.800 --> 2:58:55.720
 They found me in Lexington because I had

2:58:55.720 --> 2:58:57.360
 to use my real driver's license.

2:58:57.360 --> 2:58:59.120
 I had a laptop.

2:58:59.120 --> 2:59:00.920
 I had prepaid debit cards.

2:59:00.920 --> 2:59:03.040
 And I had stolen identity information.

2:59:03.040 --> 2:59:09.240
 And the way it got me was I had dyed my hair this flaming red.

2:59:09.240 --> 2:59:10.280
 I had this deep tan.

2:59:10.280 --> 2:59:11.920
 I didn't look anything like myself.

2:59:11.920 --> 2:59:18.160
 And I was at a hotel, had the curtains open, saw this guy.

2:59:18.160 --> 2:59:21.120
 I was on the laptop, saw this guy walk by.

2:59:21.120 --> 2:59:24.600
 He walks by the window, and he stops.

2:59:24.600 --> 2:59:26.560
 And then he backs up.

2:59:26.560 --> 2:59:28.120
 He looks inside.

2:59:28.120 --> 2:59:30.080
 He knocks on the window.

2:59:30.080 --> 2:59:31.080
 I look up at him.

2:59:31.080 --> 2:59:32.680
 He's like, you.

2:59:32.680 --> 2:59:33.480
 I was like, me?

2:59:33.480 --> 2:59:34.840
 He's like, you.

2:59:34.840 --> 2:59:37.520
 Then he pulls out this badge, and he points at it.

2:59:37.520 --> 2:59:39.920
 He's like, and then he points at the door.

2:59:39.920 --> 2:59:41.320
 Now!

2:59:41.320 --> 2:59:42.480
 So I was like, oh, OK.

2:59:42.480 --> 2:59:44.080
 So I open up the door.

2:59:44.080 --> 2:59:47.480
 He's like, US Marshals Service.

2:59:47.480 --> 2:59:49.240
 So they arrest me.

2:59:49.240 --> 2:59:50.600
 How did they track you down?

2:59:50.600 --> 2:59:51.640
 They canvassed that area.

2:59:51.640 --> 2:59:54.880
 They talked to every hotel, everything else.

2:59:54.880 --> 2:59:57.200
 So it's like a traditional, like, they were just tracking?

2:59:57.200 --> 2:59:58.440
 Traditional police work is what it was.

2:59:58.440 --> 2:59:59.960
 So it wasn't like, from the internet,

2:59:59.960 --> 3:00:01.080
 they kind of got something?

3:00:01.080 --> 3:00:02.200
 I don't know, just straight police work.

3:00:02.200 --> 3:00:03.200
 Good, good, good, good.

3:00:03.200 --> 3:00:05.800
 US Marshals are outstanding in everything they do.

3:00:05.800 --> 3:00:06.760
 So they arrest me.

3:00:06.760 --> 3:00:09.320
 I go to a, I'm initially held at a county

3:00:09.320 --> 3:00:11.240
 jail in Moorhead, Kentucky.

3:00:11.240 --> 3:00:14.600
 And that, man, that was one hell of an experience there.

3:00:14.600 --> 3:00:17.360
 But then I'm transferred after sentencing on that.

3:00:17.360 --> 3:00:20.440
 So sentencing, here's the weird thing.

3:00:20.440 --> 3:00:23.000
 So I spend like, I think, two or three months at the county

3:00:23.000 --> 3:00:26.200
 jail in Moorhead, Kentucky.

3:00:26.200 --> 3:00:27.480
 Get sentenced.

3:00:27.480 --> 3:00:31.600
 At my sentencing, it happens so quickly

3:00:31.600 --> 3:00:34.000
 after the initial sentencing that they

3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:36.360
 use the exact same presentence report.

3:00:36.360 --> 3:00:39.120
 The report that's got all that drug shit in there.

3:00:39.120 --> 3:00:42.080
 So at my sentencing, prosecutor's there,

3:00:42.080 --> 3:00:47.640
 Secret Service is there, judge, me, and my attorney.

3:00:47.640 --> 3:00:48.640
 Prosecutor stands up.

3:00:48.640 --> 3:00:50.760
 He's like, Your Honor, we would like

3:00:50.760 --> 3:00:54.160
 it if you would consider that when Mr. Johnson was arrested,

3:00:54.160 --> 3:00:56.600
 he had a laptop, he had all this information with him,

3:00:56.600 --> 3:01:00.040
 looks like he was engaged in identity theft yet again.

3:01:00.040 --> 3:01:03.160
 Judge looks at the prosecutor, says no.

3:01:03.160 --> 3:01:05.240
 Says, hey, if you were going to charge him with it,

3:01:05.240 --> 3:01:06.780
 you should have charged him with it.

3:01:06.780 --> 3:01:08.520
 I'm only considering the escape.

3:01:08.520 --> 3:01:09.760
 Then he looks at me.

3:01:09.760 --> 3:01:11.600
 He's like, Mr. Johnson.

3:01:11.600 --> 3:01:14.240
 He said, it looks like by you keeping your mouth shut right

3:01:14.240 --> 3:01:16.720
 now, you're really saving yourself

3:01:16.720 --> 3:01:17.760
 a pretty serious charge.

3:01:17.760 --> 3:01:20.360
 And my response was, yes, Your Honor.

3:01:20.360 --> 3:01:22.680
 And he was like, then he opens up the presentence report,

3:01:22.680 --> 3:01:24.240
 he's fingering through, and he's like,

3:01:24.240 --> 3:01:26.560
 it also looks like before you got

3:01:26.560 --> 3:01:30.040
 involved with all these drugs, you were a pretty good citizen.

3:01:30.040 --> 3:01:33.160
 I was like, yes, Your Honor.

3:01:33.160 --> 3:01:34.760
 And he's like, so here's what I'm going to do.

3:01:34.760 --> 3:01:38.720
 He said, I'm going to give you 18 months on the escape.

3:01:38.720 --> 3:01:39.680
 I was like, OK.

3:01:39.680 --> 3:01:41.240
 He said, I'm also going to give you,

3:01:41.240 --> 3:01:42.320
 no, it's 15 months on the escape.

3:01:42.320 --> 3:01:44.040
 He said, I'm going to give you 15 months on the escape.

3:01:44.040 --> 3:01:48.760
 He said, and I'm also going to order the drug program for you.

3:01:48.760 --> 3:01:51.720
 I was like, yes, Your Honor.

3:01:51.720 --> 3:01:54.920
 So the drug program gives you a year off,

3:01:54.920 --> 3:01:59.240
 and it gives you six months and halfway house.

3:01:59.240 --> 3:02:03.600
 So by escaping, I got out of prison three months earlier

3:02:03.600 --> 3:02:05.520
 than what I should have gotten out of it.

3:02:05.520 --> 3:02:11.160
 So the original thing about drugs worked in the long term.

3:02:11.160 --> 3:02:12.680
 The interesting thing with that, and this

3:02:12.680 --> 3:02:14.240
 was the best lie I ever told, honestly,

3:02:14.240 --> 3:02:17.360
 the best lie I ever told.

3:02:17.360 --> 3:02:21.800
 I spent eight months in solitary confinement, eight months.

3:02:21.800 --> 3:02:24.160
 And that's an experience.

3:02:24.160 --> 3:02:27.440
 Because you ain't got no books for the first month or so,

3:02:27.440 --> 3:02:30.480
 then they give you a King James Bible.

3:02:30.480 --> 3:02:31.720
 Yeah.

3:02:31.720 --> 3:02:34.920
 And then for a month, no books.

3:02:34.920 --> 3:02:36.360
 No books for a month.

3:02:36.360 --> 3:02:38.280
 This is a pretty small and.

3:02:38.280 --> 3:02:39.200
 Six by nine room.

3:02:39.200 --> 3:02:40.160
 Six by nine.

3:02:40.160 --> 3:02:41.240
 Yeah.

3:02:41.240 --> 3:02:41.920
 No books.

3:02:41.920 --> 3:02:44.400
 No books, no paper, no pen, no pencil.

3:02:44.400 --> 3:02:45.560
 You're alone with your mind.

3:02:45.560 --> 3:02:48.280
 You got a mat, a toilet.

3:02:48.280 --> 3:02:50.120
 What's that like?

3:02:50.120 --> 3:02:52.240
 You sleep as much as you can.

3:02:52.240 --> 3:02:55.640
 You're sleeping 16, 18 hours a day is what you're doing.

3:02:55.640 --> 3:03:00.720
 What about, were you thinking about even just going back

3:03:00.720 --> 3:03:01.800
 like Elizabeth?

3:03:01.800 --> 3:03:02.520
 You think about.

3:03:02.520 --> 3:03:03.640
 You go through all that.

3:03:03.640 --> 3:03:04.200
 The whole thing.

3:03:04.200 --> 3:03:04.920
 Through all that.

3:03:04.920 --> 3:03:05.560
 Every bit.

3:03:05.560 --> 3:03:06.640
 Your mom, too.

3:03:06.640 --> 3:03:07.120
 Yeah.

3:03:07.120 --> 3:03:08.760
 Going through every single bit of that.

3:03:08.760 --> 3:03:12.920
 And so you're supposed to get out an hour a day.

3:03:12.920 --> 3:03:15.320
 Law says you're supposed to get out an hour a day.

3:03:15.320 --> 3:03:16.320
 That's the law.

3:03:16.320 --> 3:03:18.160
 That's not the way things actually happen.

3:03:18.160 --> 3:03:21.520
 What actually happens is you're lucky to get out an hour a week.

3:03:21.520 --> 3:03:25.280
 You take a shower twice a week, and that's it.

3:03:25.280 --> 3:03:26.840
 You get a phone call once a month.

3:03:26.840 --> 3:03:28.760
 Oh, so you don't get to see nature.

3:03:28.760 --> 3:03:29.640
 Don't see anything.

3:03:29.640 --> 3:03:31.640
 You're getting solitary.

3:03:31.640 --> 3:03:34.200
 And it takes about a week.

3:03:34.200 --> 3:03:36.440
 The first week is the roughest.

3:03:36.440 --> 3:03:38.400
 You're bouncing off the walls that first week

3:03:38.400 --> 3:03:40.640
 because you can't sleep, can't do anything else.

3:03:40.640 --> 3:03:43.560
 Then you start to adapt to it after a while.

3:03:43.560 --> 3:03:46.480
 When that book does arrive, you're happy as hell to have it.

3:03:46.480 --> 3:03:49.840
 I'm well versed in King James Bible.

3:03:49.840 --> 3:03:51.840
 So you're happy to have it.

3:03:51.840 --> 3:03:53.760
 Then finally, you get other books

3:03:53.760 --> 3:03:56.280
 that come in from that point.

3:03:56.280 --> 3:03:57.720
 Spent eight months at that.

3:03:57.720 --> 3:04:02.640
 And they send me out to a real prison, Big Spring, Texas,

3:04:02.640 --> 3:04:07.200
 West Texas, where have you been out there?

3:04:07.200 --> 3:04:07.680
 No.

3:04:07.680 --> 3:04:08.160
 Man.

3:04:08.160 --> 3:04:10.000
 But I could tell.

3:04:10.000 --> 3:04:13.160
 Prairie dogs and tarantulas is what it is.

3:04:13.160 --> 3:04:16.400
 No kidding, it gets so hot that warnings

3:04:16.400 --> 3:04:19.720
 come on the radio telling you not to drive on certain streets

3:04:19.720 --> 3:04:21.120
 because they're melted.

3:04:21.120 --> 3:04:23.560
 That's Big Spring.

3:04:23.560 --> 3:04:26.760
 So if you've seen the movie From Dusk

3:04:26.760 --> 3:04:30.880
 Till Dawn, the opening scene is in Big Spring, Texas.

3:04:30.880 --> 3:04:31.440
 So it's hot.

3:04:31.440 --> 3:04:33.240
 Yeah, very hot.

3:04:33.240 --> 3:04:35.360
 And that's where I find out what a real prison is.

3:04:35.360 --> 3:04:38.520
 And it's not ran by guards.

3:04:38.520 --> 3:04:40.280
 Prisons are ran by inmates.

3:04:40.280 --> 3:04:41.760
 And that's a fact.

3:04:41.760 --> 3:04:47.440
 So you're met at the door by whatever race you are

3:04:47.440 --> 3:04:48.200
 is what happens.

3:04:48.200 --> 3:04:50.840
 So Big Spring is a converted Air Force compound.

3:04:50.840 --> 3:04:52.160
 It's a disciplinary prison.

3:04:52.160 --> 3:04:54.200
 So you get the bad guys are in there.

3:04:54.200 --> 3:05:00.160
 So I go through processing, and I'm walking up to the unit,

3:05:00.160 --> 3:05:03.560
 and I'm met at the door by a guy named Nick Sandifer.

3:05:03.560 --> 3:05:06.120
 He's the treasurer of the Aryan Brotherhood.

3:05:06.120 --> 3:05:08.640
 And first question out of his mouth

3:05:08.640 --> 3:05:10.640
 is, any more white guys come in?

3:05:10.640 --> 3:05:11.680
 And shit, I didn't know.

3:05:11.680 --> 3:05:13.760
 I was like, hell, I don't know, four or five?

3:05:13.760 --> 3:05:17.360
 Next question is, what are you in here for?

3:05:17.360 --> 3:05:19.360
 My answer was, because I'm like, I got no worries.

3:05:19.360 --> 3:05:20.920
 My answer was, computer crime.

3:05:20.920 --> 3:05:22.760
 Smiled at him.

3:05:22.760 --> 3:05:27.160
 Turns out, wrong thing to say, because computer crime is not

3:05:27.160 --> 3:05:30.080
 credit card theft or hacking or any bullshit like that.

3:05:30.080 --> 3:05:34.080
 Computer crime in prison is child pornography.

3:05:34.080 --> 3:05:35.440
 So tell him that.

3:05:35.440 --> 3:05:37.680
 He looks at me like I'm a piece of shit,

3:05:37.680 --> 3:05:38.920
 goes and gets his buddies.

3:05:38.920 --> 3:05:40.760
 They circle around.

3:05:40.760 --> 3:05:41.760
 What are you in here for?

3:05:41.760 --> 3:05:45.040
 I like how the Aryan Brotherhood has lines.

3:05:45.040 --> 3:05:47.920
 They're like, oh, yeah, this is child porn.

3:05:47.920 --> 3:05:48.760
 That's it.

3:05:48.760 --> 3:05:49.920
 That's the bad guy.

3:05:49.920 --> 3:05:50.680
 They circle around.

3:05:50.680 --> 3:05:53.360
 They're like, what did you say you're in here for?

3:05:53.360 --> 3:05:55.760
 So I'm sitting there trying to explain it to them.

3:05:55.760 --> 3:05:57.280
 They're like, you tell a good story.

3:05:57.280 --> 3:05:59.440
 You still said this.

3:05:59.440 --> 3:06:02.120
 Computer crime basically really does

3:06:02.120 --> 3:06:04.760
 mean usually child pornography.

3:06:04.760 --> 3:06:06.120
 In prison, yeah.

3:06:06.120 --> 3:06:08.320
 And what you see, and that's one of things you find out,

3:06:08.320 --> 3:06:10.960
 the guys that are going in there for child porn,

3:06:10.960 --> 3:06:14.120
 they will tell them it's credit card theft.

3:06:14.120 --> 3:06:15.400
 So yeah.

3:06:15.400 --> 3:06:15.880
 Right.

3:06:15.880 --> 3:06:16.680
 They've learned.

3:06:16.680 --> 3:06:17.920
 So I'm that guy.

3:06:17.920 --> 3:06:19.840
 But you also don't, I mean, for people

3:06:19.840 --> 3:06:22.840
 who are just listening to this, you don't exactly look

3:06:22.840 --> 3:06:24.840
 like the typical computer hacker.

3:06:24.840 --> 3:06:25.680
 That's true.

3:06:25.680 --> 3:06:26.360
 That's true.

3:06:26.360 --> 3:06:27.480
 That's very true.

3:06:27.480 --> 3:06:29.320
 But I don't look like the pedophile either.

3:06:29.320 --> 3:06:30.640
 That's right.

3:06:30.640 --> 3:06:31.480
 That's right.

3:06:31.480 --> 3:06:34.080
 But it's like it doesn't make it seem like you're, I mean,

3:06:34.080 --> 3:06:36.000
 I guess you're not wearing a hoodie,

3:06:36.000 --> 3:06:41.040
 and you're not like emo, dark.

3:06:41.040 --> 3:06:43.160
 The way it actually works in prison,

3:06:43.160 --> 3:06:47.520
 they won't attack you until they know.

3:06:47.520 --> 3:06:50.920
 So they have to see paperwork, which now in federal prison,

3:06:50.920 --> 3:06:54.280
 you don't get transported with paperwork because of that.

3:06:54.280 --> 3:06:57.000
 So they have to see paperwork, or a guard

3:06:57.000 --> 3:07:00.680
 will tell them what you're in there for.

3:07:00.680 --> 3:07:02.480
 Guards will tell who the pedophiles are.

3:07:02.480 --> 3:07:06.000
 So none of the guards told them that it was anything.

3:07:06.000 --> 3:07:08.080
 So for the first month, they think I am,

3:07:08.080 --> 3:07:09.720
 but they're not doing anything because they

3:07:09.720 --> 3:07:10.960
 don't know for sure.

3:07:10.960 --> 3:07:12.360
 At the end of the first month, I'd

3:07:12.360 --> 3:07:15.680
 been talking to Kevin Polson over at Wired Magazine

3:07:15.680 --> 3:07:17.680
 about Max Butler.

3:07:17.680 --> 3:07:19.000
 He does an article about that.

3:07:19.000 --> 3:07:20.400
 It shows up in Wired Magazine.

3:07:20.400 --> 3:07:21.360
 So at the end of the first month,

3:07:21.360 --> 3:07:24.880
 Wired Magazine hits a compound, front cover, all the story.

3:07:24.880 --> 3:07:25.720
 You would think.

3:07:25.720 --> 3:07:27.240
 You would think it saved me.

3:07:27.240 --> 3:07:29.640
 So I'm reading the article, really happy about it.

3:07:29.640 --> 3:07:31.920
 So what happens is four o clock is mail call.

3:07:31.920 --> 3:07:34.000
 Four o clock's a stand up count nationwide.

3:07:34.000 --> 3:07:35.520
 After four o clock is your mail call.

3:07:35.520 --> 3:07:37.160
 They hand out all the mail for the day.

3:07:37.160 --> 3:07:38.800
 So the mail comes, I get the magazine.

3:07:38.800 --> 3:07:39.800
 I'm reading through it.

3:07:39.800 --> 3:07:41.560
 I'm like, well, shit, I'm good to go.

3:07:41.560 --> 3:07:45.760
 Then it says, Brett Johnson, Secret Service informant

3:07:45.760 --> 3:07:47.520
 in the article.

3:07:47.520 --> 3:07:49.560
 So you're now a snitch.

3:07:49.560 --> 3:07:51.480
 Which is right up there with the pedophiles.

3:07:51.480 --> 3:07:55.400
 So we go to dinner after that.

3:07:55.400 --> 3:07:57.120
 At dinner, you can hear it.

3:07:57.120 --> 3:07:57.920
 You can hear the chat.

3:07:57.920 --> 3:07:58.760
 We got a snitch.

3:07:58.760 --> 3:08:01.000
 I think it's that guy over there.

3:08:01.000 --> 3:08:04.680
 Warden, next day, shuts down the entire compound,

3:08:04.680 --> 3:08:06.080
 calls me into his office.

3:08:06.080 --> 3:08:07.160
 They got security there.

3:08:07.160 --> 3:08:08.480
 They got the counselors there and everything else.

3:08:08.480 --> 3:08:09.280
 Warden looks at me.

3:08:09.280 --> 3:08:12.680
 He's like, did you give an interview to Wired Magazine?

3:08:12.680 --> 3:08:13.920
 I'm like, yeah.

3:08:13.920 --> 3:08:17.240
 He's like, do you not know they will kill you in here?

3:08:17.240 --> 3:08:21.840
 I was like, he was like, do you feel safe?

3:08:21.840 --> 3:08:24.440
 Well, I know if you tell me you don't feel safe,

3:08:24.440 --> 3:08:25.280
 they transport you.

3:08:25.280 --> 3:08:27.160
 Transport you means another eight months

3:08:27.160 --> 3:08:28.680
 in solitary confinement.

3:08:28.680 --> 3:08:31.880
 You start to see shit in solitary after a while.

3:08:31.880 --> 3:08:33.240
 So I'm like, no, not gonna do that.

3:08:33.240 --> 3:08:34.960
 So I'm like, completely safe.

3:08:34.960 --> 3:08:37.200
 He was like, look, he's like,

3:08:37.200 --> 3:08:42.160
 if anybody says anything to you, immediately come to us

3:08:42.160 --> 3:08:44.640
 because they'll fucking kill you.

3:08:44.640 --> 3:08:45.880
 So they do a locker search,

3:08:45.880 --> 3:08:47.200
 try to confiscate the magazines.

3:08:47.200 --> 3:08:48.040
 They can't.

3:08:48.040 --> 3:08:50.320
 The next day, I walk into the unit.

3:08:50.320 --> 3:08:52.200
 There's Nick Sandefur laying on his bunk,

3:08:52.200 --> 3:08:53.960
 magazine wide open reading it.

3:08:53.960 --> 3:08:55.640
 I'm like, oh shit.

3:08:55.640 --> 3:08:56.480
 Walked up to him.

3:08:56.480 --> 3:08:58.440
 I was like, hey, Nick, what are you doing?

3:08:58.440 --> 3:09:00.080
 He's like, oh, doing some reading.

3:09:00.080 --> 3:09:01.320
 I was like, anything interesting?

3:09:01.320 --> 3:09:03.560
 He's like, it's getting there.

3:09:03.560 --> 3:09:07.080
 I was like, let me save you the trouble.

3:09:07.080 --> 3:09:08.560
 Take the magazine, turn it over to the page.

3:09:08.560 --> 3:09:10.960
 I was like, right there is what you're looking for.

3:09:10.960 --> 3:09:12.680
 He was like, man, I already knew.

3:09:12.680 --> 3:09:15.640
 I was like, do we have a problem?

3:09:15.640 --> 3:09:16.480
 And he looks at me.

3:09:16.480 --> 3:09:20.120
 He's like, is anyone on the compound you told on?

3:09:20.120 --> 3:09:21.280
 I was like, no.

3:09:21.280 --> 3:09:24.680
 He's like, until someone gets here, you snitched on.

3:09:24.680 --> 3:09:26.000
 We're okay.

3:09:26.000 --> 3:09:28.160
 I was like, okay.

3:09:28.160 --> 3:09:31.240
 He's like, but I need you to do something for me.

3:09:32.120 --> 3:09:35.280
 All right, so in federal prison, you gotta have a job.

3:09:35.280 --> 3:09:36.120
 Everybody works.

3:09:36.120 --> 3:09:37.600
 It doesn't matter what you do, but you gotta work.

3:09:37.600 --> 3:09:41.240
 I got a job in education teaching a lit class.

3:09:42.120 --> 3:09:45.320
 Every Wednesday, six to 8.30 PM, lit.

3:09:45.320 --> 3:09:48.840
 And had all, every area on the compound

3:09:48.840 --> 3:09:50.280
 signs up for the lit class.

3:09:50.280 --> 3:09:52.440
 Had a couple of guards every now and then popped in.

3:09:52.440 --> 3:09:54.880
 And did we teach lit?

3:09:54.880 --> 3:09:56.920
 No, we taught fraud.

3:09:56.920 --> 3:09:59.920
 Every Wednesday, six to 8.30 PM.

3:09:59.920 --> 3:10:02.160
 That's how I didn't get my ass beaten.

3:10:02.160 --> 3:10:04.720
 And my other job, I had two jobs with them.

3:10:04.720 --> 3:10:07.840
 The other job, you get to the point, it's weird, man.

3:10:07.840 --> 3:10:11.720
 You get to the point, people walking off the bus,

3:10:11.720 --> 3:10:14.040
 you know immediately two groups of people.

3:10:14.040 --> 3:10:16.760
 You know who the bank robbers are immediately.

3:10:16.760 --> 3:10:18.120
 Just by them walking off the bus,

3:10:18.120 --> 3:10:20.400
 you're like, that motherfucker's a bank robber.

3:10:20.400 --> 3:10:23.600
 And you know who the pedophiles are immediately.

3:10:23.600 --> 3:10:27.200
 So my job as the white guy was to approach

3:10:27.200 --> 3:10:29.880
 the white pedophiles and have a conversation.

3:10:29.880 --> 3:10:31.080
 And the conversation was basically,

3:10:31.080 --> 3:10:34.680
 hey, don't know what you're in here for.

3:10:34.680 --> 3:10:37.000
 Don't care what you're in here for.

3:10:37.000 --> 3:10:40.040
 But if you got some sort of fucked up charge,

3:10:40.960 --> 3:10:42.000
 you need to tell me.

3:10:43.160 --> 3:10:46.320
 If you tell me, everything's gonna be all right.

3:10:46.320 --> 3:10:49.480
 If you don't tell me, you see those guys over there?

3:10:49.480 --> 3:10:51.200
 If you start to associate with them

3:10:51.200 --> 3:10:52.600
 or they start to talk to you,

3:10:52.600 --> 3:10:55.480
 and then they find out you're in here on something,

3:10:55.480 --> 3:10:57.240
 they're gonna kill you.

3:10:57.240 --> 3:10:59.640
 And what are the things, pedophile?

3:10:59.640 --> 3:11:02.680
 Pedophile, rapist, anything that harms children,

3:11:02.680 --> 3:11:04.760
 harms women, anything like that.

3:11:04.760 --> 3:11:07.120
 And there are, it's like the mob,

3:11:07.120 --> 3:11:10.440
 there's rules, there's an ethical code.

3:11:10.440 --> 3:11:14.200
 Even if you have the division between races on all that,

3:11:15.160 --> 3:11:17.760
 you still have these lines drawn.

3:11:17.760 --> 3:11:19.680
 And there's a hierarchy too.

3:11:19.680 --> 3:11:20.520
 Very, very much so.

3:11:20.520 --> 3:11:22.000
 And what that looks like in prison,

3:11:22.000 --> 3:11:25.080
 depending on the, it depends on the security class

3:11:25.080 --> 3:11:27.640
 that you're in, what level prison.

3:11:27.640 --> 3:11:29.840
 But at that prison, what that looked like

3:11:29.840 --> 3:11:33.320
 was you're not allowed to talk to anybody.

3:11:33.320 --> 3:11:35.480
 You're not allowed to watch television.

3:11:35.480 --> 3:11:37.240
 You can go to the library.

3:11:37.240 --> 3:11:40.680
 You don't associate with anyone except your own type.

3:11:40.680 --> 3:11:43.720
 If you do anything like this, we will kill you.

3:11:44.600 --> 3:11:47.560
 If someone wants to extort you,

3:11:47.560 --> 3:11:51.000
 we will do that too and you won't tell on us

3:11:51.000 --> 3:11:52.640
 or we'll kill you.

3:11:52.640 --> 3:11:55.440
 So that's the way that works at that point.

3:11:55.440 --> 3:11:58.080
 And everybody quickly large this.

3:11:58.080 --> 3:11:59.640
 Quickly, quickly.

3:11:59.640 --> 3:12:02.400
 And so typically the guys would say,

3:12:02.400 --> 3:12:03.680
 I just wanna do my own time.

3:12:03.680 --> 3:12:05.080
 That would be the line.

3:12:05.080 --> 3:12:08.400
 And it's like, okay, don't mess with him, all right?

3:12:09.640 --> 3:12:11.720
 Every now and then you'd have somebody lie

3:12:11.720 --> 3:12:14.800
 and that would come with those types of consequences.

3:12:14.800 --> 3:12:19.800
 I got to see, while I was there, saw two people murdered,

3:12:20.840 --> 3:12:23.160
 saw, went through three prison riots

3:12:23.160 --> 3:12:26.960
 and through my entire tenure in prison, saw four suicides.

3:12:26.960 --> 3:12:29.880
 The people who got killed, it was,

3:12:29.880 --> 3:12:32.040
 so we had, outside you had this track,

3:12:32.040 --> 3:12:33.440
 a third of a mile track.

3:12:33.440 --> 3:12:35.760
 You walk it counterclockwise.

3:12:35.760 --> 3:12:38.200
 And inside of the track, you got two handball courts.

3:12:38.200 --> 3:12:42.400
 So of an evening that happened both times,

3:12:42.400 --> 3:12:44.680
 all of us would be walking, doing our exercises.

3:12:44.680 --> 3:12:47.720
 And at the top of the key, like a flock of birds,

3:12:47.720 --> 3:12:51.120
 you'd see all the inmates start to migrate down

3:12:51.120 --> 3:12:52.000
 toward the gate.

3:12:52.920 --> 3:12:55.280
 So the first time you see that, you see that migration,

3:12:55.280 --> 3:12:57.800
 you look up in the distance and one of the inmates

3:12:57.800 --> 3:13:01.680
 got another inmate down and he's just hammering his head

3:13:01.680 --> 3:13:04.040
 right into the pavement, like that right there.

3:13:04.040 --> 3:13:07.480
 Well, guards don't stop that because a guard may get hurt.

3:13:07.480 --> 3:13:11.680
 So a guard is 15 minutes coming out to stop that

3:13:11.680 --> 3:13:12.520
 until everything's over.

3:13:12.520 --> 3:13:15.280
 By that point, the guy doesn't have a head.

3:13:15.280 --> 3:13:17.800
 They shut the compound down and this is what happens.

3:13:17.800 --> 3:13:20.080
 So you shut the entire compound down.

3:13:20.960 --> 3:13:22.800
 They make two lines of the inmates.

3:13:22.800 --> 3:13:25.800
 And what happens is the inmate walks into a room,

3:13:25.800 --> 3:13:27.320
 they shut the door behind the inmate,

3:13:27.320 --> 3:13:28.680
 guard asks them two questions.

3:13:28.680 --> 3:13:30.360
 First question is, did you see anything?

3:13:30.360 --> 3:13:31.640
 The answer is no.

3:13:31.640 --> 3:13:34.200
 Second question is, if you had seen anything,

3:13:34.200 --> 3:13:35.480
 would you say anything?

3:13:35.480 --> 3:13:36.680
 Answer is no.

3:13:36.680 --> 3:13:38.520
 Guard then says, get the fuck out.

3:13:38.520 --> 3:13:40.120
 And that's it.

3:13:40.120 --> 3:13:42.800
 Anybody that stays in any longer than that

3:13:43.960 --> 3:13:45.840
 is automatically suspect.

3:13:45.840 --> 3:13:49.600
 So there was one incident, I remember this Hispanic guy,

3:13:49.600 --> 3:13:51.680
 he's in there for a few minutes.

3:13:51.680 --> 3:13:55.960
 And everybody's like, what's going on?

3:13:55.960 --> 3:13:59.400
 So his people then call him over,

3:13:59.400 --> 3:14:00.960
 explain to us what went on.

3:14:01.800 --> 3:14:03.200
 And it happens like that.

3:14:03.200 --> 3:14:05.080
 It's fascinating because you talked about

3:14:05.080 --> 3:14:10.080
 the network of trust in the cyber crime community.

3:14:10.680 --> 3:14:13.160
 And here's a network of trust

3:14:13.160 --> 3:14:15.000
 in the prison crime community.

3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:17.440
 And trust.

3:14:17.440 --> 3:14:18.960
 Trust matters.

3:14:18.960 --> 3:14:21.080
 Trust drives everything at the end of the day.

3:14:21.080 --> 3:14:23.080
 The riots that I went through,

3:14:23.080 --> 3:14:26.320
 the first riot, man, you're scared to death.

3:14:26.320 --> 3:14:27.520
 Scared to death.

3:14:27.520 --> 3:14:29.400
 You know, you've got the cops dressed up

3:14:29.400 --> 3:14:30.680
 in the Ninja Turtle outfits,

3:14:30.680 --> 3:14:33.000
 you've got the rubber bullets,

3:14:33.000 --> 3:14:35.520
 the tear gas canisters, all that crap.

3:14:35.520 --> 3:14:37.920
 You got the inmates that are raising hell.

3:14:37.920 --> 3:14:39.240
 Scared to death.

3:14:39.240 --> 3:14:42.400
 The second riot, you calm down.

3:14:42.400 --> 3:14:44.680
 Second riot, you start to notice.

3:14:44.680 --> 3:14:46.200
 This is racial riot.

3:14:46.200 --> 3:14:48.680
 This is typically, and almost always,

3:14:48.680 --> 3:14:50.840
 it's Hispanics and African Americans.

3:14:50.840 --> 3:14:53.920
 So you get to detect what is the motivation

3:14:53.920 --> 3:14:55.400
 for the riot, what is the reason,

3:14:55.400 --> 3:14:56.560
 and that gives you some calm.

3:14:56.560 --> 3:14:57.400
 That's exactly right.

3:14:57.400 --> 3:14:58.680
 So the second riot, you start to notice this.

3:14:58.680 --> 3:15:00.840
 Hey, man, this ain't me.

3:15:00.840 --> 3:15:02.640
 This ain't our group.

3:15:02.640 --> 3:15:03.760
 Third riot, no shit.

3:15:03.760 --> 3:15:05.680
 Third riot, you lay in your bunk.

3:15:07.800 --> 3:15:10.680
 You let them wage war all around you,

3:15:10.680 --> 3:15:12.040
 and every now and then you have an inmate

3:15:12.040 --> 3:15:13.640
 that'll run up to you and he'll point to a locker

3:15:13.640 --> 3:15:14.760
 and say, is that your locker?

3:15:14.760 --> 3:15:16.800
 And if you tell him yes, they leave it alone.

3:15:16.800 --> 3:15:17.960
 If you say it's not my locker,

3:15:17.960 --> 3:15:20.080
 they'll break into it and steal everything out of it

3:15:20.080 --> 3:15:23.440
 and go from there, and that's what happens, but.

3:15:23.440 --> 3:15:25.400
 So you did your time for five years.

3:15:25.400 --> 3:15:26.240
 Five and a half.

3:15:26.240 --> 3:15:27.920
 Five and a half.

3:15:27.920 --> 3:15:28.840
 You made it out.

3:15:28.840 --> 3:15:29.680
 Made it out.

3:15:29.680 --> 3:15:32.280
 I went through, I told you it was a good lie that I told.

3:15:32.280 --> 3:15:35.680
 I went through the residential drug abuse program.

3:15:35.680 --> 3:15:37.800
 It's a nine month intensive therapy,

3:15:37.800 --> 3:15:42.120
 and the way I got to that, this counselor at Big Spring,

3:15:42.120 --> 3:15:44.680
 he bought this.

3:15:44.680 --> 3:15:46.800
 He wanted inmates to be educated.

3:15:46.800 --> 3:15:48.240
 He was a really good guy.

3:15:48.240 --> 3:15:49.640
 So he wanted inmates to be educated.

3:15:49.640 --> 3:15:54.640
 He got a discount on a game theory class set.

3:15:55.000 --> 3:15:56.680
 So he gets all these discs and everything,

3:15:56.680 --> 3:15:59.400
 and he's asking, does anybody on the compound

3:15:59.400 --> 3:16:00.960
 know anything about game theory?

3:16:00.960 --> 3:16:04.800
 And somebody says, if anybody does, it'll be Brett Johnson.

3:16:04.800 --> 3:16:07.480
 So he comes up to me one day at my buggy.

3:16:07.480 --> 3:16:09.120
 He's like, are you Brett Johnson?

3:16:09.120 --> 3:16:10.160
 I was like, yeah.

3:16:10.160 --> 3:16:12.640
 He was like, do you know anything about game theory?

3:16:12.640 --> 3:16:15.280
 And I was like, yes, I do.

3:16:15.280 --> 3:16:17.160
 So I start rattling off Prisoner's Dilemma

3:16:17.160 --> 3:16:18.000
 and everything else.

3:16:18.000 --> 3:16:20.120
 He's like, well, you teach a class?

3:16:20.120 --> 3:16:21.160
 So I start teaching that.

3:16:21.160 --> 3:16:23.440
 I start teaching inmates public speaking

3:16:24.480 --> 3:16:26.640
 and to make friends with this counselor.

3:16:26.640 --> 3:16:29.680
 So it gets time where I'm supposed to be transferring out

3:16:29.680 --> 3:16:32.880
 to this drug program that they only had in Fort Worth,

3:16:32.880 --> 3:16:36.440
 and the transfers are taking like four or five months.

3:16:36.440 --> 3:16:39.280
 That's four or five months I could be out free.

3:16:39.280 --> 3:16:41.440
 So I went up to him one day and I was like, look,

3:16:41.440 --> 3:16:42.280
 his name was Keely.

3:16:42.280 --> 3:16:45.360
 I was like, look, man, I said, is there any way

3:16:45.360 --> 3:16:47.080
 that I can get transferred out any sooner?

3:16:47.080 --> 3:16:50.800
 And he looks at me and he's like, Brett, I cannot help you.

3:16:50.800 --> 3:16:52.080
 And I was like, I appreciate that.

3:16:52.080 --> 3:16:53.840
 Thank you so much for even trying.

3:16:53.840 --> 3:16:58.080
 So he said that a week later, I'm on a bus

3:16:58.080 --> 3:16:59.120
 by going to Fort Worth.

3:16:59.120 --> 3:17:00.080
 So he got me to Fort Worth.

3:17:00.080 --> 3:17:00.920
 I got it.

3:17:00.920 --> 3:17:01.760
 Yeah.

3:17:01.760 --> 3:17:02.580
 I love it.

3:17:02.580 --> 3:17:04.240
 So it was a nine month program,

3:17:04.240 --> 3:17:06.720
 24 hours a day of cognitive behavioral therapy.

3:17:06.720 --> 3:17:07.800
 Had nothing to do with drugs.

3:17:07.800 --> 3:17:12.080
 It was all peer study stuff and CBT training.

3:17:12.080 --> 3:17:15.960
 And honestly, it's the best thing that could ever happen.

3:17:15.960 --> 3:17:16.800
 Truly is.

3:17:16.800 --> 3:17:21.600
 So that part, what was the thing that changed you as a man?

3:17:21.600 --> 3:17:23.520
 Is it the solitary confinement?

3:17:23.520 --> 3:17:24.680
 Was it the years?

3:17:24.680 --> 3:17:28.840
 Was it losing the people you loved?

3:17:28.840 --> 3:17:30.600
 Or was it that behavioral therapy?

3:17:30.600 --> 3:17:31.920
 It's a combination, man.

3:17:31.920 --> 3:17:32.840
 It's a combination.

3:17:32.840 --> 3:17:36.500
 It was, so my sister disowns me.

3:17:36.500 --> 3:17:38.320
 The only person I had in my life.

3:17:38.320 --> 3:17:41.400
 I mean, me and my sister, that's it.

3:17:41.400 --> 3:17:42.920
 I mean, yeah, I loved Elizabeth.

3:17:42.920 --> 3:17:46.440
 I love my wife now, but it's...

3:17:46.440 --> 3:17:49.240
 Me and my sister, we went through all that shit together.

3:17:49.240 --> 3:17:50.320
 So Denise disowns me.

3:17:50.320 --> 3:17:52.920
 She doesn't talk to me for an entire year

3:17:52.920 --> 3:17:54.640
 when all this stuff happens.

3:17:54.640 --> 3:17:58.920
 And after I get arrested on the escape,

3:17:58.920 --> 3:18:01.040
 she ends up driving seven hours

3:18:01.040 --> 3:18:02.520
 to come see me to tell me she loves me.

3:18:02.520 --> 3:18:04.920
 And I don't see her again for five and a half years.

3:18:04.920 --> 3:18:05.760
 Yeah.

3:18:05.760 --> 3:18:07.920
 So that's really the first turnaround.

3:18:07.920 --> 3:18:10.320
 Took me two and a half years in prison

3:18:10.320 --> 3:18:12.720
 to accept responsibility.

3:18:12.720 --> 3:18:14.640
 That was amazing that she did that.

3:18:14.640 --> 3:18:15.480
 Yeah.

3:18:15.480 --> 3:18:16.520
 She's down.

3:18:16.520 --> 3:18:17.360
 Yeah.

3:18:17.360 --> 3:18:18.200
 She did that.

3:18:18.200 --> 3:18:19.020
 Yeah, she's something.

3:18:19.020 --> 3:18:19.860
 She's something.

3:18:19.860 --> 3:18:20.880
 Yeah, she saw me for 10 minutes,

3:18:20.880 --> 3:18:23.320
 tell me she loves me and then I don't see her again.

3:18:23.320 --> 3:18:24.160
 Planted the seed.

3:18:24.160 --> 3:18:24.980
 Yeah.

3:18:24.980 --> 3:18:25.820
 Yeah.

3:18:25.820 --> 3:18:26.660
 So...

3:18:26.660 --> 3:18:29.320
 But yeah, you had time to think over those years.

3:18:29.320 --> 3:18:31.280
 Took two and a half years to realize

3:18:31.280 --> 3:18:32.620
 that I didn't commit crime

3:18:32.620 --> 3:18:35.320
 because of stripper girlfriends or wives or family.

3:18:35.320 --> 3:18:38.180
 I committed it because I wanted to, chose to.

3:18:38.180 --> 3:18:42.080
 And that's the first turnaround.

3:18:42.080 --> 3:18:45.400
 Second turnaround is the CBT training.

3:18:45.400 --> 3:18:50.120
 It didn't really hit while I was in prison.

3:18:50.120 --> 3:18:52.140
 I went through it and they ingrained it in you,

3:18:52.140 --> 3:18:56.720
 but until you choose to make it work, it doesn't work.

3:18:56.720 --> 3:19:00.520
 So I got out in 2011, didn't wanna break the law, did not.

3:19:00.520 --> 3:19:02.920
 And I was under three years probation,

3:19:02.920 --> 3:19:04.620
 couldn't touch a computer.

3:19:04.620 --> 3:19:07.440
 I had a job offer from Deloitte

3:19:07.440 --> 3:19:10.760
 to run a cyber crime office in the UK,

3:19:10.760 --> 3:19:11.840
 which that was a no.

3:19:11.840 --> 3:19:13.880
 Now you're not moving and that's a computer idiot.

3:19:13.880 --> 3:19:18.240
 So then I had a job offer from Know Before,

3:19:18.240 --> 3:19:20.680
 a phishing company, couldn't take that.

3:19:20.680 --> 3:19:24.040
 I got to where I was trying to apply for fast food jobs.

3:19:24.040 --> 3:19:26.440
 That's a computer, can't touch that.

3:19:26.440 --> 3:19:28.780
 Okay, then what about a waiter's position?

3:19:28.780 --> 3:19:31.760
 Well, that's a computer and access to credit cards, idiot.

3:19:31.760 --> 3:19:33.480
 Can't touch that either.

3:19:33.480 --> 3:19:36.500
 So literally could not get a job, could not.

3:19:38.400 --> 3:19:40.040
 Doing food stamps, I had a roommate

3:19:40.040 --> 3:19:42.520
 that paid half the rent.

3:19:42.520 --> 3:19:43.760
 They tell you when you leave prison

3:19:43.760 --> 3:19:46.840
 to get a job in something you care about

3:19:46.840 --> 3:19:48.940
 and you won't recidivate, couldn't get a job.

3:19:48.940 --> 3:19:53.480
 And what I had was a cat, and Monster the Cat,

3:19:53.480 --> 3:19:55.320
 that was the cat's name.

3:19:55.320 --> 3:19:59.600
 And I had enough money to feed that little guy

3:19:59.600 --> 3:20:02.720
 and didn't have money to buy toilet paper for the apartment.

3:20:02.720 --> 3:20:05.400
 So I was on Panama City Beach.

3:20:05.400 --> 3:20:07.360
 How long were you living like this?

3:20:07.360 --> 3:20:08.920
 It was a steady decline,

3:20:08.920 --> 3:20:11.400
 because remember I taught my dad how to commit tax fraud.

3:20:11.400 --> 3:20:14.280
 So he bankrolled a lot of that until he couldn't.

3:20:14.280 --> 3:20:18.160
 And then from there, it's like, what the fuck do you do?

3:20:18.160 --> 3:20:20.800
 So I didn't want to go into computer crime at all.

3:20:20.800 --> 3:20:25.220
 And I ended up shoplifting toilet paper, man.

3:20:25.220 --> 3:20:26.520
 Shoplifting toilet paper.

3:20:26.520 --> 3:20:30.600
 Just like for the basics, the basics of survival.

3:20:30.600 --> 3:20:35.200
 So about the same time I had a friend that, this guy,

3:20:35.200 --> 3:20:37.720
 I'd been dating the same type of women I had been dating,

3:20:37.720 --> 3:20:41.580
 you know, the unhealthy ones, the hot unhealthy ones.

3:20:41.580 --> 3:20:45.000
 Yes, love, that's how that works.

3:20:45.000 --> 3:20:49.000
 So I had a friend post an ad for me on Plenty of Fish.

3:20:49.000 --> 3:20:53.100
 And this woman responds, my wife, she responds.

3:20:53.100 --> 3:20:56.520
 And the pictures I had taken were these prison type pictures,

3:20:56.520 --> 3:20:59.000
 you know, the serious like, they were there.

3:20:59.000 --> 3:21:01.480
 She sends me a message of, why aren't you smiling?

3:21:01.480 --> 3:21:04.240
 And my response was, that is my happy face.

3:21:04.240 --> 3:21:09.320
 So we start talking and we started dating.

3:21:09.320 --> 3:21:13.320
 And she's that second saving thing, man.

3:21:13.320 --> 3:21:14.720
 I ended up moving in with her.

3:21:14.720 --> 3:21:15.720
 I was going broke.

3:21:15.720 --> 3:21:17.300
 I was about to get kicked out of the apartment and everything

3:21:17.300 --> 3:21:17.600
 else.

3:21:17.600 --> 3:21:20.000
 And she didn't say it, but I think she knew it.

3:21:20.000 --> 3:21:26.440
 And moved in with her.

3:21:26.440 --> 3:21:27.880
 And I got a job.

3:21:27.880 --> 3:21:30.040
 And the job I got, my probation officer

3:21:30.040 --> 3:21:31.560
 let me have a cell phone.

3:21:31.560 --> 3:21:32.800
 I was going through Craigslist.

3:21:32.800 --> 3:21:35.040
 This guy was advertising for landscaping.

3:21:35.040 --> 3:21:35.880
 Called him up.

3:21:35.880 --> 3:21:38.060
 His name was Dustin DeRamus.

3:21:38.060 --> 3:21:38.760
 Called him up.

3:21:38.760 --> 3:21:40.000
 And he's like, come on down, talk to me.

3:21:40.000 --> 3:21:42.080
 So he was running this business, him and his brother

3:21:42.080 --> 3:21:43.800
 were, out of his house.

3:21:43.800 --> 3:21:46.240
 So I'm sitting there talking to him for about 20 minutes.

3:21:46.240 --> 3:21:46.800
 He looks at me.

3:21:46.800 --> 3:21:48.340
 He's like, can I ask you a question?

3:21:48.340 --> 3:21:49.360
 I was like, yeah.

3:21:49.360 --> 3:21:51.920
 He's like, are you on the run or something?

3:21:51.920 --> 3:21:53.440
 So I'm like, no, why?

3:21:53.440 --> 3:21:55.240
 And he's like, well, you just don't look

3:21:55.240 --> 3:21:57.980
 like the kind of guy that do this.

3:21:57.980 --> 3:21:59.040
 So I told him.

3:21:59.040 --> 3:21:59.920
 I was like, this is who I am.

3:21:59.920 --> 3:22:01.000
 This is what I've done.

3:22:01.000 --> 3:22:03.320
 And he looks at me.

3:22:03.320 --> 3:22:05.800
 He's like, man, I got to think about that.

3:22:05.800 --> 3:22:08.640
 So he tells me to go on home.

3:22:08.640 --> 3:22:09.800
 That was a Friday.

3:22:09.800 --> 3:22:11.320
 Sunday evening, he gives me a call.

3:22:11.320 --> 3:22:17.820
 And he was like, Brett, if I hire you, will you actually work?

3:22:17.820 --> 3:22:20.000
 And I told him, I was like, Dustin, if you give me a job,

3:22:20.000 --> 3:22:22.440
 I promise I'll work my ass off.

3:22:22.440 --> 3:22:24.120
 And he's like, show up 6 o clock.

3:22:24.120 --> 3:22:25.140
 I was like, all right.

3:22:25.140 --> 3:22:29.000
 So my job was to push a lawnmower 10 hours a day,

3:22:29.000 --> 3:22:33.240
 five days a week for $400 a week, and busted my ass.

3:22:33.240 --> 3:22:40.200
 I hit it so hard, I would come in of a night and pass out,

3:22:40.200 --> 3:22:42.200
 wake up the next morning, and hit it again.

3:22:42.200 --> 3:22:47.560
 And it got to the point, this dude

3:22:47.560 --> 3:22:51.440
 ended up offering me to come in and partner with his business.

3:22:51.440 --> 3:22:52.400
 His brother dropped out.

3:22:52.400 --> 3:22:54.900
 And by that point, I'd learned everything

3:22:54.900 --> 3:22:56.400
 on the business and everything.

3:22:56.400 --> 3:22:58.840
 And he was like, if you'd like to come in,

3:22:58.840 --> 3:22:59.720
 I'll cut you in half.

3:22:59.720 --> 3:23:02.260
 And I was like, Dustin, I can't do it, man.

3:23:02.260 --> 3:23:03.720
 Because I wasn't making any money.

3:23:03.720 --> 3:23:07.480
 He didn't want to pay me anymore until he was able to do more.

3:23:07.480 --> 3:23:12.400
 And I thought I found another job doing something else.

3:23:12.400 --> 3:23:14.600
 And in a speech, I say it got cold and the grass

3:23:14.600 --> 3:23:15.600
 started to stop growing.

3:23:15.600 --> 3:23:18.760
 The truth of the matter was I thought I found another job.

3:23:18.760 --> 3:23:23.400
 Guy was offering to pay me $1,500 a week doing the sales

3:23:23.400 --> 3:23:26.640
 for oil rig training, was what it was.

3:23:26.640 --> 3:23:29.320
 And I accepted the job.

3:23:29.320 --> 3:23:31.920
 I quit working for Dustin.

3:23:31.920 --> 3:23:36.480
 And the guy, I told him before he even offered me a job,

3:23:36.480 --> 3:23:38.400
 I told him my criminal history because I

3:23:38.400 --> 3:23:41.040
 was required to do that.

3:23:41.040 --> 3:23:42.360
 So I was supposed to start work.

3:23:42.360 --> 3:23:44.720
 Well, he calls me and tells me he can't hire me.

3:23:44.720 --> 3:23:46.800
 So I'm out of work.

3:23:46.800 --> 3:23:49.040
 And Dustin's already hired somebody else by that point,

3:23:49.040 --> 3:23:51.680
 so I can't go back with him.

3:23:51.680 --> 3:23:58.840
 And I'm that guy again, man.

3:23:58.840 --> 3:24:05.640
 It's important for me to show value in a relationship.

3:24:05.640 --> 3:24:10.120
 So Michelle was the only one working.

3:24:10.120 --> 3:24:12.280
 I'm like, I got to do something.

3:24:12.280 --> 3:24:14.320
 And I get it in my head.

3:24:14.320 --> 3:24:16.120
 I was like, if nothing else, I can just

3:24:16.120 --> 3:24:17.760
 bring food in the house.

3:24:17.760 --> 3:24:20.320
 She was only making, I think she was, I mean,

3:24:20.320 --> 3:24:23.360
 we had it hard, it was just her working.

3:24:23.360 --> 3:24:27.720
 And I was like, if nothing else, I can bring food in the house

3:24:27.720 --> 3:24:32.520
 and get on the dark web, get some stolen credit cards,

3:24:32.520 --> 3:24:33.600
 start ordering food.

3:24:33.600 --> 3:24:36.440
 Well, it gets worse than that.

3:24:36.440 --> 3:24:38.400
 She's got two sons there.

3:24:38.400 --> 3:24:40.360
 So I'm like, well, they need clothes.

3:24:40.360 --> 3:24:42.760
 So they start stealing clothes.

3:24:42.760 --> 3:24:44.280
 And it continues like that.

3:24:44.280 --> 3:24:45.080
 I get arrested.

3:24:45.080 --> 3:24:48.200
 I get arrested on a food order.

3:24:48.200 --> 3:24:53.200
 And Michelle didn't know what I was doing.

3:24:53.200 --> 3:24:55.960
 So she had been to work, and she was coming back from work.

3:24:55.960 --> 3:24:56.560
 I get arrested.

3:24:56.560 --> 3:24:59.240
 And I'm like, they let me make a phone call.

3:24:59.240 --> 3:25:01.440
 And I call her, and I say, come to the police station.

3:25:01.440 --> 3:25:02.200
 I've been arrested.

3:25:02.200 --> 3:25:04.520
 And she shows up.

3:25:04.520 --> 3:25:06.800
 And she didn't know I'd been doing that.

3:25:06.800 --> 3:25:11.720
 My probation officer, of course, he didn't know anything else.

3:25:11.720 --> 3:25:14.880
 At my sentencing for that, probation officer

3:25:14.880 --> 3:25:19.680
 was there, prosecutor, the judge, US Marshals, Michelle,

3:25:19.680 --> 3:25:21.240
 and me.

3:25:21.240 --> 3:25:23.280
 Michelle stands up, and she tells the judge

3:25:23.280 --> 3:25:25.000
 that I'm a better dad to her kids

3:25:25.000 --> 3:25:26.840
 than their actual father is.

3:25:26.840 --> 3:25:33.400
 And by that point, I'm crying.

3:25:33.400 --> 3:25:35.360
 Probation officer stands up.

3:25:35.360 --> 3:25:39.280
 And he was like, we think Mr. Johnson's a good guy.

3:25:39.280 --> 3:25:40.600
 We think this is a one time thing.

3:25:40.600 --> 3:25:43.680
 Prosecutor says the same thing.

3:25:43.680 --> 3:25:46.880
 Judge sentences me to one year.

3:25:46.880 --> 3:25:49.240
 Probation officer stands back up.

3:25:49.240 --> 3:25:52.800
 And he was like, Mr. Johnson, Judge,

3:25:52.800 --> 3:25:55.600
 if you can give Mr. Johnson a year and a day,

3:25:55.600 --> 3:25:59.440
 he can get the good time and get back to his family sooner.

3:25:59.440 --> 3:26:01.920
 So the judge amends the sentence to a year and a day.

3:26:01.920 --> 3:26:03.040
 So I served 10 months.

3:26:03.040 --> 3:26:04.960
 They sent me back to Texas.

3:26:04.960 --> 3:26:08.480
 And that's when I find out that Michelle didn't need me

3:26:08.480 --> 3:26:10.160
 for what I could give her.

3:26:10.160 --> 3:26:12.040
 She just wanted me for me that entire time.

3:26:12.040 --> 3:26:14.960
 She stands by me the entire time.

3:26:14.960 --> 3:26:16.760
 I do my 10 months, get out.

3:26:16.760 --> 3:26:18.120
 We get married after that.

3:26:18.120 --> 3:26:20.160
 And they kill probation.

3:26:20.160 --> 3:26:21.280
 So I can touch a computer.

3:26:21.280 --> 3:26:23.880
 They tell you, they were like, you know,

3:26:23.880 --> 3:26:28.520
 inmates, a felon, if nothing else, he can sell cars.

3:26:28.520 --> 3:26:30.520
 Well, it turns out you can't.

3:26:30.520 --> 3:26:32.640
 You can sell cars if you're a drug dealer.

3:26:32.640 --> 3:26:34.160
 If you're the guy that steals all the money and people's

3:26:34.160 --> 3:26:35.720
 information, no, fuck no.

3:26:35.720 --> 3:26:37.960
 You can't get a job selling cars.

3:26:37.960 --> 3:26:39.720
 So can't get a job.

3:26:39.720 --> 3:26:40.680
 Cannot.

3:26:40.680 --> 3:26:45.080
 And to this day, Lex, I know what my triggers are.

3:26:45.080 --> 3:26:46.480
 I know what it would take to get me back

3:26:46.480 --> 3:26:48.320
 into committing crime.

3:26:48.320 --> 3:26:50.120
 So, and I knew I'd go so far at that point.

3:26:50.120 --> 3:26:51.240
 So I looked at Michelle and I was like,

3:26:51.240 --> 3:26:53.080
 let me see what I can do.

3:26:53.080 --> 3:26:56.920
 Signed on to LinkedIn, reached out to this FBI super cop

3:26:56.920 --> 3:26:58.960
 named Keith Malarski out of the Pittsburgh office.

3:26:58.960 --> 3:27:02.360
 He was involved with my arrest and some associates

3:27:02.360 --> 3:27:05.240
 and everything else and sent him a message.

3:27:05.240 --> 3:27:06.200
 And the message was, you know,

3:27:06.200 --> 3:27:07.760
 hey, I respect everything you did.

3:27:07.760 --> 3:27:09.720
 Think you did a great job.

3:27:09.720 --> 3:27:12.400
 By the way, I'd like to be legal.

3:27:12.400 --> 3:27:16.240
 And dude responded within two hours.

3:27:16.240 --> 3:27:19.360
 Two hours, he gives me references, advice,

3:27:19.360 --> 3:27:22.160
 takes me in under his wing, everything else like that.

3:27:22.160 --> 3:27:24.200
 And from that point, man, it was the head

3:27:24.200 --> 3:27:26.640
 of the identity theft council did the same thing.

3:27:28.840 --> 3:27:31.480
 Card not present group hires me to speak.

3:27:31.480 --> 3:27:34.400
 Microsoft hires me to consult with them.

3:27:34.400 --> 3:27:37.520
 And the Microsoft hire established enough trust

3:27:37.520 --> 3:27:40.880
 in the industry that I was all right from that point.

3:27:42.400 --> 3:27:45.240
 So now you're helping in many ways,

3:27:45.240 --> 3:27:48.720
 fight the very guy that you used to be.

3:27:48.720 --> 3:27:51.360
 So big picture advice.

3:27:52.280 --> 3:27:55.760
 What, given that you were that guy,

3:27:55.760 --> 3:27:58.160
 how do we fight cyber crime today

3:27:58.160 --> 3:28:01.920
 and in the next five years, 10 years, 20 years, 50 years?

3:28:01.920 --> 3:28:04.240
 What advice do you have to individuals, to companies,

3:28:04.240 --> 3:28:09.240
 to governments of what, and also to Elizabeth,

3:28:13.480 --> 3:28:18.480
 like the humans, human beings that love,

3:28:19.960 --> 3:28:24.040
 that live, that are friends with cyber criminals?

3:28:24.040 --> 3:28:29.040
 There's so many lessons to really be had from that.

3:28:30.520 --> 3:28:33.520
 To me, the lesson, one of the big lessons to me

3:28:33.520 --> 3:28:37.320
 is you can't serve two masters.

3:28:38.720 --> 3:28:41.280
 If you're that guy that is committing crime

3:28:41.280 --> 3:28:43.440
 or that person that's addicted,

3:28:43.440 --> 3:28:48.320
 or you're in love with somebody that's addicted or has that,

3:28:48.320 --> 3:28:49.400
 they don't love you.

3:28:49.400 --> 3:28:51.600
 They love that addiction that comes first.

3:28:51.600 --> 3:28:53.120
 It's always gonna come first.

3:28:53.120 --> 3:28:54.720
 So you have to realize that.

3:28:54.720 --> 3:28:59.720
 You have to know when to cut somebody off,

3:28:59.720 --> 3:29:02.560
 when to end something, that knowing

3:29:02.560 --> 3:29:07.280
 that they're not gonna change until they decide to change.

3:29:07.280 --> 3:29:08.720
 At the same time, you gotta realize

3:29:08.720 --> 3:29:12.200
 that the only reason I was able to turn my life around

3:29:12.200 --> 3:29:14.880
 is because people took that chance on me.

3:29:14.880 --> 3:29:16.680
 That's really the only reason.

3:29:16.680 --> 3:29:18.480
 They believe that there's a good person in there.

3:29:18.480 --> 3:29:21.600
 Yeah, if Malarski hadn't responded,

3:29:21.600 --> 3:29:23.720
 if I hadn't had my sister, my wife,

3:29:23.720 --> 3:29:26.440
 these companies that initially gave me that chance,

3:29:26.440 --> 3:29:28.960
 my ass would be back in prison for 20 years.

3:29:28.960 --> 3:29:31.720
 I have no doubt about that at all, all right?

3:29:31.720 --> 3:29:33.720
 So you have to realize that.

3:29:34.600 --> 3:29:37.560
 Cybercrime, a lot of companies that I talk to,

3:29:37.560 --> 3:29:39.760
 they don't really understand or appreciate

3:29:41.160 --> 3:29:44.760
 that networking aspect, that trust aspect

3:29:44.760 --> 3:29:47.120
 of how criminals establish trust with each other,

3:29:47.120 --> 3:29:48.200
 how they work together.

3:29:48.200 --> 3:29:51.040
 A lot of companies think that it's a single player

3:29:51.040 --> 3:29:52.280
 that's out victimizing them.

3:29:52.280 --> 3:29:55.080
 And when you really break down how cybercrime operates,

3:29:55.080 --> 3:29:57.360
 that you've got a group of individuals

3:29:57.360 --> 3:29:59.280
 that are working together to hit you,

3:29:59.280 --> 3:30:00.120
 but not only hit you,

3:30:00.120 --> 3:30:03.000
 but they share and exchange information freely.

3:30:03.000 --> 3:30:04.240
 Companies don't do that.

3:30:04.240 --> 3:30:05.280
 You've got privacy concerns,

3:30:05.280 --> 3:30:07.480
 you've got competitive edge concerns, everything else.

3:30:07.480 --> 3:30:09.640
 Companies don't share information across the board

3:30:09.640 --> 3:30:11.040
 like criminals do.

3:30:11.040 --> 3:30:12.080
 Criminals do that.

3:30:13.040 --> 3:30:13.880
 You have to appreciate that.

3:30:13.880 --> 3:30:17.000
 You have to understand that big statistic

3:30:17.000 --> 3:30:19.520
 that 90% of your tax use known exploits.

3:30:19.520 --> 3:30:20.840
 It's not the stuff we don't know about,

3:30:20.840 --> 3:30:22.680
 it's the shit we do know about.

3:30:22.680 --> 3:30:24.040
 We're not doing anything about.

3:30:24.040 --> 3:30:26.040
 So the way to defend against cybercrime

3:30:26.040 --> 3:30:29.520
 is like there's a lot of low hanging fruit

3:30:29.520 --> 3:30:30.360
 that you should fix.

3:30:30.360 --> 3:30:31.280
 A lot of that.

3:30:31.280 --> 3:30:32.120
 A lot of that.

3:30:32.120 --> 3:30:33.200
 Sort of a lot of basic stuff

3:30:33.200 --> 3:30:34.440
 that's already vulnerabilities,

3:30:34.440 --> 3:30:35.880
 update the system security.

3:30:35.880 --> 3:30:39.280
 Now that doesn't take care of SolarWinds or CNAP

3:30:39.280 --> 3:30:40.360
 or anything like that.

3:30:40.360 --> 3:30:41.680
 It doesn't.

3:30:41.680 --> 3:30:45.600
 But those instances, I mean, okay, that's a big instance.

3:30:46.600 --> 3:30:47.440
 I mean, it is.

3:30:47.440 --> 3:30:52.160
 But in the full spectrum of, especially in the future,

3:30:52.160 --> 3:30:56.400
 because there's more and more companies

3:30:56.400 --> 3:30:58.880
 that are coming online, they're becoming digital.

3:30:58.880 --> 3:31:01.440
 And it's just more and more and more.

3:31:01.440 --> 3:31:03.720
 And those vulnerabilities in terms of human nature,

3:31:03.720 --> 3:31:07.680
 so for social engineering and the actual outdated systems,

3:31:07.680 --> 3:31:08.520
 all of it.

3:31:08.520 --> 3:31:11.760
 Some of it, I guess is, I mean, you're exceptionally good

3:31:11.760 --> 3:31:14.480
 at this is educating on the social engineering side,

3:31:14.480 --> 3:31:16.520
 is educating people in companies that like.

3:31:16.520 --> 3:31:18.120
 You've got to do that.

3:31:18.120 --> 3:31:20.520
 And companies have to, you know, I made that point

3:31:20.520 --> 3:31:23.320
 that they never report to law enforcement.

3:31:23.320 --> 3:31:25.160
 That's companies and individuals.

3:31:25.160 --> 3:31:27.560
 You know, I've worked with Fortune 50 companies

3:31:27.560 --> 3:31:30.960
 that will not press charges.

3:31:30.960 --> 3:31:34.440
 Instead, they'll have that insider or that criminal

3:31:34.440 --> 3:31:36.880
 sign an NDA, they'll pay them off.

3:31:36.880 --> 3:31:39.440
 And we won't mention this shit anymore.

3:31:39.440 --> 3:31:41.360
 You have to be, you have to press charges.

3:31:41.360 --> 3:31:43.600
 You have to report, you have to raise the awareness

3:31:43.600 --> 3:31:45.600
 of everyone in the group.

3:31:45.600 --> 3:31:47.800
 You have to be, it's that idea.

3:31:47.800 --> 3:31:49.040
 And I've talked about that before

3:31:49.040 --> 3:31:52.760
 of understanding your place in that cyber crime spectrum.

3:31:52.760 --> 3:31:54.680
 The way a criminal will victimize you

3:31:55.640 --> 3:31:57.360
 depends on who you are and what you do

3:31:57.360 --> 3:31:59.840
 as a person and as a business.

3:31:59.840 --> 3:32:02.240
 So you have to understand that, design security around that.

3:32:02.240 --> 3:32:05.240
 You know, we've got 7,500 security companies out there.

3:32:05.240 --> 3:32:07.680
 A whole lot of them are snake oil salesmen.

3:32:07.680 --> 3:32:09.080
 A lot of them is going to tell you that

3:32:09.080 --> 3:32:13.400
 we're the one stop solution, but you're not, you're not.

3:32:13.400 --> 3:32:15.320
 You're a tool, all right?

3:32:15.320 --> 3:32:17.400
 And you may have a very good tool,

3:32:17.400 --> 3:32:19.960
 but it's not the only tool that's needed

3:32:19.960 --> 3:32:22.400
 to protect against the attacks that are out there.

3:32:22.400 --> 3:32:24.040
 And we have to be open and honest

3:32:24.040 --> 3:32:25.560
 about that kind of stuff if we're not.

3:32:25.560 --> 3:32:29.800
 So I guess defending defense is not just like one tool.

3:32:29.800 --> 3:32:33.400
 It's a process of just like a diversity

3:32:33.400 --> 3:32:36.080
 and just constantly educating people.

3:32:36.080 --> 3:32:36.920
 Absolutely.

3:32:36.920 --> 3:32:40.200
 So it's the social side, it's constantly,

3:32:40.200 --> 3:32:42.360
 because there's so many probably attack vectors

3:32:42.360 --> 3:32:43.880
 in terms of the software that you have.

3:32:43.880 --> 3:32:45.900
 If you look at it, that attack surface,

3:32:45.900 --> 3:32:47.480
 you can't plug everything.

3:32:47.480 --> 3:32:50.160
 It's too damn large to plug everything.

3:32:50.160 --> 3:32:52.320
 But you can do the best job you can possibly do,

3:32:52.320 --> 3:32:55.760
 but it takes a variety of tools to do that, all right?

3:32:55.760 --> 3:32:59.200
 The idea, and Arcos is big about that,

3:32:59.200 --> 3:33:04.080
 but the idea is to take the cost of fraud

3:33:04.080 --> 3:33:06.780
 to the fraudster so high that they basically

3:33:06.780 --> 3:33:08.640
 try to pick another target, all right?

3:33:08.640 --> 3:33:09.820
 And that's the idea that you want.

3:33:09.820 --> 3:33:12.920
 You want it to be not worth the criminal's time

3:33:12.920 --> 3:33:14.800
 to hit your company.

3:33:14.800 --> 3:33:16.840
 What about white hat hacking?

3:33:16.840 --> 3:33:20.600
 So like hacking for good,

3:33:21.720 --> 3:33:24.840
 sort of testing systems and then giving companies

3:33:24.840 --> 3:33:27.040
 the vulnerabilities as you find them?

3:33:27.040 --> 3:33:28.320
 I think it's outstanding.

3:33:28.320 --> 3:33:29.960
 I do, I think that, I think pen testing,

3:33:29.960 --> 3:33:31.480
 white hat stuff is outstanding.

3:33:31.480 --> 3:33:32.420
 I truly do.

3:33:32.420 --> 3:33:34.760
 I think that you have to.

3:33:36.160 --> 3:33:40.860
 It has to be tempered with what is reality as well though.

3:33:40.860 --> 3:33:43.160
 All right, we've got a whole industry of people

3:33:43.160 --> 3:33:45.680
 who try to sell RFID wallets,

3:33:45.680 --> 3:33:48.480
 that I don't know of many RFID hackers out there

3:33:48.480 --> 3:33:50.760
 on the criminal side, to be honest with you.

3:33:50.760 --> 3:33:52.920
 Yeah, so some of it is just like a psychological

3:33:52.920 --> 3:33:57.920
 safety blanket that's not actually providing any protection.

3:33:58.240 --> 3:34:02.080
 By the way, you wrote on LinkedIn something about ID me.

3:34:04.520 --> 3:34:05.720
 What is it?

3:34:05.720 --> 3:34:07.160
 Why is it a problem?

3:34:07.160 --> 3:34:08.760
 I was going down a rabbit hole with you.

3:34:08.760 --> 3:34:10.800
 I was wondering if you were gonna mention that.

3:34:10.800 --> 3:34:14.040
 You know, they lost, I guess I was partially responsible

3:34:14.040 --> 3:34:16.480
 for them losing an $86 million contract.

3:34:17.480 --> 3:34:19.080
 What was the contract with the government?

3:34:19.080 --> 3:34:19.920
 With the IRS.

3:34:19.920 --> 3:34:21.300
 Just with the IRS.

3:34:21.300 --> 3:34:22.320
 So what is it?

3:34:22.320 --> 3:34:25.840
 So ID me is an identity, okay, backtrack.

3:34:25.840 --> 3:34:28.880
 ID me is a marketing company that wants to say

3:34:28.880 --> 3:34:30.440
 they're an identity verification company.

3:34:30.440 --> 3:34:32.600
 I just wanna bring this up to see you get angry.

3:34:32.600 --> 3:34:33.440
 Okay.

3:34:35.280 --> 3:34:36.880
 I'll tell you what my issue is.

3:34:36.880 --> 3:34:37.920
 My issue is.

3:34:37.920 --> 3:34:42.240
 So it's a company that's used for authentication

3:34:42.240 --> 3:34:43.600
 by the IRS, I guess.

3:34:43.600 --> 3:34:45.960
 IRS, Social Security Administration, VA,

3:34:47.080 --> 3:34:51.760
 at 1.23 state unemployment offices, few other services.

3:34:51.760 --> 3:34:54.660
 So I guess the idea is that you would be able

3:34:54.660 --> 3:34:59.660
 to unlock your account or authenticate yourself

3:35:00.220 --> 3:35:04.880
 as a human being by using your face or something like that.

3:35:04.880 --> 3:35:06.680
 Or private information.

3:35:06.680 --> 3:35:08.880
 They've got a tiered system with verification.

3:35:08.880 --> 3:35:12.040
 They've got, you can do, they've got a free system

3:35:12.040 --> 3:35:14.920
 which is questionable where you submit an ID

3:35:14.920 --> 3:35:17.840
 and it's been shown, several bypasses have been shown.

3:35:17.840 --> 3:35:20.080
 And I don't wanna talk about their security horribly bad

3:35:20.080 --> 3:35:22.880
 because I wanna be honest, there are bypasses

3:35:22.880 --> 3:35:24.920
 for a lot of security systems out there.

3:35:24.920 --> 3:35:26.400
 All right?

3:35:26.400 --> 3:35:30.760
 The issue that I have with ID me is that

3:35:30.760 --> 3:35:34.760
 their policies are somewhat questionable.

3:35:34.760 --> 3:35:36.100
 I don't care if you're a private company

3:35:36.100 --> 3:35:37.520
 that has those policies in place.

3:35:37.520 --> 3:35:40.760
 But if you're a government agency

3:35:40.760 --> 3:35:43.760
 and you as a citizen are entitled to a benefit

3:35:43.760 --> 3:35:46.680
 or a service of that government agency,

3:35:46.680 --> 3:35:49.400
 and then the government agency forces you

3:35:49.400 --> 3:35:52.400
 to give up your complete identity profile

3:35:52.400 --> 3:35:53.480
 to a private company.

3:35:53.480 --> 3:35:55.480
 And then that private company uses that profile

3:35:55.480 --> 3:35:59.440
 for marketing purposes, to further profit, things like that.

3:35:59.440 --> 3:36:01.760
 I have a huge issue with that.

3:36:01.760 --> 3:36:03.880
 I don't care if you're a private company that does that.

3:36:03.880 --> 3:36:05.840
 I just don't think that citizens need to be forced

3:36:05.840 --> 3:36:07.920
 into doing that in order to get a benefit

3:36:07.920 --> 3:36:09.960
 or service that they're entitled to.

3:36:09.960 --> 3:36:11.760
 So that's my big issue.

3:36:11.760 --> 3:36:14.840
 So that, I mean, given how much value,

3:36:14.840 --> 3:36:17.440
 how much we talked about the value of identity,

3:36:17.440 --> 3:36:19.720
 you don't think that should be handed over lightly?

3:36:19.720 --> 3:36:21.600
 No, absolutely not.

3:36:21.600 --> 3:36:23.000
 And who would have thought that Brett Johnson

3:36:23.000 --> 3:36:25.000
 would ever become a privacy advocate?

3:36:25.000 --> 3:36:29.040
 But here I am.

3:36:29.040 --> 3:36:33.240
 I mean, it's just, people don't understand

3:36:33.240 --> 3:36:37.880
 or appreciate the value of who they are.

3:36:38.920 --> 3:36:41.300
 And certainly you've got a host of companies,

3:36:41.300 --> 3:36:42.360
 ID means not the only one,

3:36:42.360 --> 3:36:44.080
 but you've got some of these companies that say,

3:36:44.080 --> 3:36:48.120
 well, we strip out the PII of the individual.

3:36:48.120 --> 3:36:49.360
 We're just using the biometrics

3:36:49.360 --> 3:36:51.560
 and the sites they're visiting and things like that.

3:36:51.560 --> 3:36:53.120
 That's identity.

3:36:53.120 --> 3:36:55.640
 You can still ping that one unique individual

3:36:55.640 --> 3:36:57.160
 out of all, using that information.

3:36:57.160 --> 3:36:58.680
 Stripping out the PII,

3:36:58.680 --> 3:37:00.880
 you can still ping who that individual is.

3:37:00.880 --> 3:37:05.040
 So having lived a life of crime for many years,

3:37:05.040 --> 3:37:08.220
 I'm sure you've connected indirectly

3:37:08.220 --> 3:37:11.600
 to a large number of very dangerous people.

3:37:11.600 --> 3:37:12.760
 Directly and directly.

3:37:12.760 --> 3:37:14.160
 Yeah.

3:37:14.160 --> 3:37:17.680
 But the network indirectly is even larger, right?

3:37:17.680 --> 3:37:18.520
 Oh yeah, oh yeah.

3:37:18.520 --> 3:37:20.940
 Are you, and I apologize for this question,

3:37:22.800 --> 3:37:27.000
 are you ever worried for your life, for your wellbeing?

3:37:27.000 --> 3:37:30.320
 Like having seen a world that's really dangerous

3:37:30.320 --> 3:37:35.080
 in ways that's not, that operates in the shadows.

3:37:38.600 --> 3:37:41.320
 Like I said, when we started Shadow Crew

3:37:41.320 --> 3:37:44.320
 and started that initial cybercrime business, that world,

3:37:46.480 --> 3:37:47.800
 violence wasn't there.

3:37:47.800 --> 3:37:49.000
 It came in later.

3:37:49.000 --> 3:37:51.560
 Now violence is inherent in the system,

3:37:51.560 --> 3:37:52.880
 to do the Monty Python bit.

3:37:52.880 --> 3:37:54.460
 It's part of it.

3:37:55.920 --> 3:37:58.800
 Yeah, the mob, the mafia are now part of this whole thing.

3:37:58.800 --> 3:38:00.000
 Cartels are part of it.

3:38:00.000 --> 3:38:00.840
 Yeah.

3:38:00.840 --> 3:38:05.120
 Drugs are inherently intertwined in cybercrime marketplaces

3:38:05.120 --> 3:38:06.600
 because of the profit potential.

3:38:06.600 --> 3:38:08.840
 And with that comes a lot of violence as well.

3:38:08.840 --> 3:38:12.080
 Yeah, the cartels already brought the violence

3:38:12.080 --> 3:38:14.120
 that they're good at from the 20th century.

3:38:14.120 --> 3:38:14.960
 Absolutely, absolutely.

3:38:14.960 --> 3:38:16.640
 Into the technology of the 21st century.

3:38:16.640 --> 3:38:20.160
 Now, do I worry about that?

3:38:20.160 --> 3:38:24.280
 It's interesting that my family worries about that.

3:38:25.720 --> 3:38:26.560
 All right.

3:38:26.560 --> 3:38:28.480
 I think I may be just too involved in it

3:38:28.480 --> 3:38:32.280
 to appreciate that type of danger.

3:38:32.280 --> 3:38:35.000
 But my family worries about that.

3:38:35.000 --> 3:38:36.040
 They do.

3:38:36.040 --> 3:38:37.540
 Do I think it's a possibility?

3:38:38.580 --> 3:38:41.200
 I'm the guy that says what needs to be said.

3:38:41.200 --> 3:38:45.320
 I've built my trust in this industry

3:38:45.320 --> 3:38:50.320
 by not being scared of calling out companies and individuals

3:38:51.600 --> 3:38:53.720
 and not being scared of targeting criminals

3:38:53.720 --> 3:38:54.840
 or criminal groups.

3:38:54.840 --> 3:38:59.840
 Your honesty as a human being emotionally

3:39:00.560 --> 3:39:03.320
 and intellectually is really refreshing.

3:39:03.320 --> 3:39:05.040
 It's a gift and thank you.

3:39:05.040 --> 3:39:06.640
 Thank you for doing that.

3:39:06.640 --> 3:39:11.640
 Is there a device you can give to young people today

3:39:11.640 --> 3:39:13.360
 about life?

3:39:13.360 --> 3:39:18.360
 You broke many rules, all the rules.

3:39:19.140 --> 3:39:21.640
 Some rules should be broken.

3:39:21.640 --> 3:39:23.200
 So if you look at somebody young today

3:39:23.200 --> 3:39:24.960
 in high school and college,

3:39:24.960 --> 3:39:29.960
 thinking how they can break the rules legally

3:39:30.000 --> 3:39:34.040
 and live a life that's something they could be really proud

3:39:34.040 --> 3:39:35.840
 of, what would you say?

3:39:35.840 --> 3:39:37.240
 Biggest lesson I've learned.

3:39:39.280 --> 3:39:43.560
 You want your life to be one where you're helping people

3:39:43.560 --> 3:39:45.440
 and not hurting people.

3:39:45.440 --> 3:39:49.920
 And that really hit me the first time I walked into Quantico.

3:39:49.920 --> 3:39:54.440
 You see the brightest minds in the United States

3:39:54.440 --> 3:39:57.040
 who give up a lot of money,

3:39:57.040 --> 3:39:58.680
 the opportunities of a lot of money

3:39:58.680 --> 3:40:01.920
 because they believe in helping people.

3:40:01.920 --> 3:40:05.260
 Where I spent a career just hurting and harming individuals,

3:40:05.260 --> 3:40:07.860
 that's a hell of a lesson.

3:40:07.860 --> 3:40:09.800
 And I'm glad I'm there,

3:40:09.800 --> 3:40:12.160
 but I would tell people out there,

3:40:12.160 --> 3:40:13.780
 it's fine to want money.

3:40:13.780 --> 3:40:14.620
 It's fine to do that.

3:40:14.620 --> 3:40:16.400
 It's fine to test systems.

3:40:16.400 --> 3:40:18.240
 It's fine to circumvent the rules

3:40:18.240 --> 3:40:19.440
 if you're not breaking the law.

3:40:19.440 --> 3:40:20.280
 It's fine to do all that.

3:40:20.280 --> 3:40:22.040
 I like doing that, all right?

3:40:22.040 --> 3:40:23.560
 But if you've got the mindset,

3:40:23.560 --> 3:40:26.560
 if you can just adhere to the mindset of helping people

3:40:26.560 --> 3:40:28.320
 and not hurting people,

3:40:28.320 --> 3:40:31.200
 I think you'll be all right at the end of the day.

3:40:31.200 --> 3:40:35.120
 What gives you, again, given the dark web,

3:40:35.120 --> 3:40:37.320
 given all the dangers out there,

3:40:37.320 --> 3:40:39.840
 what gives you hope about the future,

3:40:39.840 --> 3:40:43.080
 looking into five, 10 years, 50 years?

3:40:43.080 --> 3:40:45.480
 I mean, hope for human civilization.

3:40:45.480 --> 3:40:50.480
 If we do all right, if we make it out of this century,

3:40:53.660 --> 3:40:55.560
 what do you think would be the reason?

3:40:57.920 --> 3:40:59.160
 That's a damn good question.

3:40:59.160 --> 3:41:01.360
 Because I mean, we've got a lot of bad stuff going on.

3:41:01.360 --> 3:41:03.280
 We've got a lot of reasons.

3:41:03.280 --> 3:41:05.840
 If I asked you the other question of

3:41:05.840 --> 3:41:08.280
 how do you think human civilization would destroy itself,

3:41:08.280 --> 3:41:10.680
 I'm sure you have a lot of answers.

3:41:10.680 --> 3:41:12.520
 You know what gives me hope is

3:41:12.520 --> 3:41:16.960
 that you see people working together.

3:41:16.960 --> 3:41:19.200
 The COVIDs have been a little bit different

3:41:19.200 --> 3:41:20.520
 because I think too many people

3:41:20.520 --> 3:41:22.240
 wanted to play politics with it.

3:41:22.240 --> 3:41:24.000
 That's been the heartbreaking thing about COVID

3:41:24.000 --> 3:41:26.920
 is it's in many ways pulled people apart.

3:41:26.920 --> 3:41:29.760
 I mean, because a virus involves

3:41:29.760 --> 3:41:33.840
 kind of being afraid of each other

3:41:33.840 --> 3:41:35.780
 because I mean, that was a scary thing.

3:41:35.780 --> 3:41:38.240
 People talk about pandemics in that way

3:41:38.240 --> 3:41:40.120
 that you're afraid of other humans.

3:41:40.120 --> 3:41:41.660
 That is the most terrifying thing.

3:41:41.660 --> 3:41:44.480
 It's not the destructive nature of what it does to your body.

3:41:44.480 --> 3:41:46.760
 It's just that it pulls people apart.

3:41:46.760 --> 3:41:49.280
 And then you realize how fundamental

3:41:49.280 --> 3:41:51.240
 that human connection is to human civilization.

3:41:51.240 --> 3:41:53.080
 Absolutely, absolutely.

3:41:53.080 --> 3:41:55.460
 But you know, as human beings,

3:41:55.460 --> 3:41:59.440
 we do, when things really get bad,

3:41:59.440 --> 3:42:00.500
 when things really get bad,

3:42:00.500 --> 3:42:03.680
 we do tend to respond and group together.

3:42:03.680 --> 3:42:04.520
 We do that.

3:42:04.520 --> 3:42:09.520
 When there's injustice, we see it, we rise up.

3:42:09.520 --> 3:42:14.520
 I wake up every morning and I watch Fox News and CNN

3:42:15.440 --> 3:42:17.520
 so I can be pissed off at everyone.

3:42:17.520 --> 3:42:21.440
 All right, so the division, the outrage,

3:42:21.440 --> 3:42:22.600
 they're really feeding.

3:42:22.600 --> 3:42:25.120
 They want you, they want you to be angry.

3:42:25.120 --> 3:42:27.880
 Yeah, that's what causes me to spare

3:42:27.880 --> 3:42:30.720
 and what I think that, you know, we just need to.

3:42:30.720 --> 3:42:32.640
 Elizabeth was very good.

3:42:32.640 --> 3:42:34.000
 She taught me one hell of a lesson

3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:37.440
 because before I met her, I was a news hound.

3:42:37.440 --> 3:42:38.840
 News would be on all the time.

3:42:38.840 --> 3:42:40.120
 A couple of channels of it.

3:42:40.120 --> 3:42:45.120
 And she was the woman who didn't watch the news at all.

3:42:45.620 --> 3:42:48.360
 And I didn't understand that back then, man.

3:42:48.360 --> 3:42:49.520
 But now I do.

3:42:49.520 --> 3:42:52.480
 You know, now I'm like, it's pretty smart, you know?

3:42:52.480 --> 3:42:55.560
 Don't need to listen to that bullshit as it is.

3:42:55.560 --> 3:42:58.200
 That's why I love reading history books.

3:42:59.280 --> 3:43:03.920
 I just, I feel like that's the right perspective

3:43:03.920 --> 3:43:05.600
 on take on modern times.

3:43:05.600 --> 3:43:07.600
 You know, how will this time be written about

3:43:07.600 --> 3:43:10.440
 in the history books and react to that?

3:43:10.440 --> 3:43:15.440
 Don't the daily ups and downs of the outrages,

3:43:15.640 --> 3:43:17.280
 which is getting worse and worse

3:43:17.280 --> 3:43:19.440
 in terms of how quick the turnaround is

3:43:19.440 --> 3:43:20.800
 in terms of the news.

3:43:20.800 --> 3:43:22.920
 I'll tell you what, I'm sitting here.

3:43:22.920 --> 3:43:24.840
 I appreciate you talking to me.

3:43:24.840 --> 3:43:28.440
 I do, because, you know, I talk about that relationship

3:43:28.440 --> 3:43:29.280
 and everything.

3:43:29.280 --> 3:43:32.080
 It's really been this kind of realization

3:43:32.080 --> 3:43:33.000
 for me on a lot of things.

3:43:33.000 --> 3:43:34.960
 So I really appreciate you asking those questions

3:43:34.960 --> 3:43:36.760
 and everything, maybe be able to talk about that.

3:43:36.760 --> 3:43:41.760
 I love it that you value, first of all,

3:43:41.920 --> 3:43:43.720
 you're self aware how important love

3:43:43.720 --> 3:43:45.240
 is in a human being's life.

3:43:46.640 --> 3:43:48.200
 It can make you do some of the best

3:43:48.200 --> 3:43:50.240
 and some of the worst things in this world.

3:43:50.240 --> 3:43:51.640
 And it's good to think about that.

3:43:51.640 --> 3:43:53.240
 It's good to think about that.

3:43:53.240 --> 3:43:55.280
 That is what makes us human, is that connection

3:43:55.280 --> 3:43:56.720
 and that love for each other.

3:44:00.120 --> 3:44:01.880
 What do you think is the meaning of life?

3:44:01.880 --> 3:44:03.240
 This big, ridiculous question.

3:44:03.240 --> 3:44:05.240
 Why the hell, what are we all here for?

3:44:05.240 --> 3:44:07.720
 I don't think it is ridiculous, man.

3:44:07.720 --> 3:44:09.760
 To me, that meaning of life is finding out

3:44:09.760 --> 3:44:13.440
 that lesson that we need to help each other.

3:44:13.440 --> 3:44:15.160
 If you talk, you ask about security,

3:44:15.160 --> 3:44:16.000
 how do you get to say that?

3:44:16.000 --> 3:44:18.520
 But, you know, everybody's worried about themselves.

3:44:19.520 --> 3:44:21.840
 The way you solve that security problem

3:44:21.840 --> 3:44:26.440
 is it takes everybody looking out for everyone else.

3:44:26.440 --> 3:44:29.440
 That's how you solve that problem.

3:44:29.440 --> 3:44:32.400
 And however you take, whatever journey you take

3:44:32.400 --> 3:44:34.000
 to discovering that point.

3:44:34.000 --> 3:44:37.680
 Yeah, I mean, with me, I've been asked a few times,

3:44:37.680 --> 3:44:38.520
 do you regret anything?

3:44:38.520 --> 3:44:40.000
 Would you change anything?

3:44:40.000 --> 3:44:45.000
 I've done a shitload of despicable things in my life.

3:44:46.480 --> 3:44:50.240
 But I'm at a point in my life where I like who I am.

3:44:50.240 --> 3:44:51.960
 And I know that I am doing exactly

3:44:51.960 --> 3:44:53.680
 what I'm supposed to be doing with my life.

3:44:53.680 --> 3:44:55.600
 So, would I change anything?

3:44:55.600 --> 3:44:59.440
 As bad as a lot of that shit has been, I wouldn't.

3:44:59.440 --> 3:45:00.880
 It made you who you are.

3:45:00.880 --> 3:45:01.960
 Yeah.

3:45:01.960 --> 3:45:03.240
 The whole of it, the whole mess.

3:45:03.240 --> 3:45:05.640
 That's trite to say that, but it's true.

3:45:05.640 --> 3:45:07.360
 That's the weird thing, it's true.

3:45:09.160 --> 3:45:10.000
 Yeah.

3:45:10.000 --> 3:45:13.640
 Also, you mentioned that you're thinking of launching a show.

3:45:13.640 --> 3:45:14.520
 What's it gonna be called?

3:45:14.520 --> 3:45:16.440
 Cause you've done a couple of podcasts.

3:45:16.440 --> 3:45:17.840
 You're incredibly good at this.

3:45:17.840 --> 3:45:18.960
 You're so good at this.

3:45:18.960 --> 3:45:19.800
 I've done a couple.

3:45:19.800 --> 3:45:22.480
 I'm on a lot of podcasts and everything like that.

3:45:22.480 --> 3:45:25.880
 I had the fraud cast with a friend of mine,

3:45:25.880 --> 3:45:26.720
 Carice Hendrick.

3:45:26.720 --> 3:45:29.240
 And that ended because of a difference of opinion.

3:45:29.240 --> 3:45:34.240
 Depending on who you ask, one of us was an asshole.

3:45:34.320 --> 3:45:35.160
 Yes.

3:45:35.160 --> 3:45:36.000
 And it may have been me.

3:45:36.000 --> 3:45:36.840
 Yeah.

3:45:36.840 --> 3:45:38.520
 But then I did the Anglerfish podcast,

3:45:38.520 --> 3:45:40.160
 which that was, I gotta be honest with you, Lex,

3:45:40.160 --> 3:45:41.920
 it was completely directionless.

3:45:41.920 --> 3:45:43.960
 And it was Brett Johnson getting lazy.

3:45:43.960 --> 3:45:45.000
 Yeah.

3:45:45.000 --> 3:45:46.840
 So I ended that.

3:45:46.840 --> 3:45:50.080
 The Brett Johnson show is launching.

3:45:50.080 --> 3:45:50.920
 That's the new one.

3:45:50.920 --> 3:45:51.760
 That's the new one.

3:45:51.760 --> 3:45:52.600
 That's what the new one's called.

3:45:52.600 --> 3:45:53.800
 And, you know, I.

3:45:53.800 --> 3:45:55.520
 What do you think I'm doing with it?

3:45:56.800 --> 3:45:58.360
 Making a difference, for one thing.

3:45:58.360 --> 3:46:00.960
 But it's gonna be talking about cyber crime security,

3:46:00.960 --> 3:46:01.800
 helping people.

3:46:03.120 --> 3:46:03.960
 Interviews.

3:46:03.960 --> 3:46:04.800
 Interviews.

3:46:04.800 --> 3:46:06.480
 A lot of it's gonna be solo.

3:46:06.480 --> 3:46:08.080
 Now I'm calling it the Brett Johnson show.

3:46:08.080 --> 3:46:10.240
 I mean, because it's gonna handle crime,

3:46:10.240 --> 3:46:12.200
 talk to criminals and how they turn their lives around

3:46:12.200 --> 3:46:13.360
 to a degree as well.

3:46:13.360 --> 3:46:15.240
 But there's some shit I wanna bitch about too.

3:46:15.240 --> 3:46:16.080
 Yeah.

3:46:16.080 --> 3:46:16.920
 So figure it out.

3:46:16.920 --> 3:46:17.740
 I can tell you're good at this.

3:46:17.740 --> 3:46:18.580
 I'm a fan already.

3:46:18.580 --> 3:46:19.420
 I wanna listen.

3:46:19.420 --> 3:46:20.240
 I wanna subscribe.

3:46:20.240 --> 3:46:21.080
 You should too.

3:46:21.080 --> 3:46:22.600
 You're launching it soon.

3:46:22.600 --> 3:46:23.440
 Soon.

3:46:23.440 --> 3:46:24.680
 Next week.

3:46:24.680 --> 3:46:26.360
 Brett, you're an incredible human being.

3:46:26.360 --> 3:46:29.920
 The honesty, the love.

3:46:29.920 --> 3:46:33.280
 I could just see how much of yourself you put out there.

3:46:33.280 --> 3:46:36.480
 One of the best public speakers I've ever heard.

3:46:36.480 --> 3:46:38.440
 Definitely you should be in a Scorsese film

3:46:38.440 --> 3:46:39.660
 about cyber crime.

3:46:41.320 --> 3:46:43.840
 100%, I could tell you're a good actor.

3:46:43.840 --> 3:46:45.360
 It makes perfect sense.

3:46:45.360 --> 3:46:47.280
 Anyway, I really, I'm deeply honored

3:46:47.280 --> 3:46:48.960
 that you'll spend your time with me today.

3:46:48.960 --> 3:46:49.800
 I am, actually.

3:46:49.800 --> 3:46:50.640
 Thank you.

3:46:50.640 --> 3:46:51.460
 It was amazing.

3:46:51.460 --> 3:46:52.880
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

3:46:52.880 --> 3:46:53.960
 with Brett Johnson.

3:46:53.960 --> 3:46:56.400
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors

3:46:56.400 --> 3:46:57.800
 in the description.

3:46:57.800 --> 3:46:59.640
 And now, let me leave you with some words

3:46:59.640 --> 3:47:03.540
 from George R.R. Martin, from A Clash of Kings.

3:47:04.500 --> 3:47:07.680
 A good act does not wash out the bad,

3:47:07.680 --> 3:47:10.240
 nor a bad act the good.

3:47:10.240 --> 3:47:12.280
 Each should have its own reward.

3:47:12.280 --> 3:47:25.280
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
