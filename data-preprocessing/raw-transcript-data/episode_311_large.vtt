00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
 you have to have the free markets

00:03.000 --> 00:04.840
 in order to build prosperity.

00:04.840 --> 00:09.360
 And prosperity means economic power.

00:09.360 --> 00:14.000
 If you have economic power, no one messes with you.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.840
 Or if they're gonna do it, they're gonna have to think twice

00:15.840 --> 00:18.640
 and when they do, they're gonna have to pay consequences.

00:20.640 --> 00:23.560
 The following is a conversation with Magat Wade,

00:23.560 --> 00:25.920
 an entrepreneur who's passionate

00:25.920 --> 00:28.120
 about creating positive change in Africa

00:28.120 --> 00:31.000
 through economic empowerment.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:34.880 --> 00:36.120
 in the description.

00:36.120 --> 00:39.680
 And now, dear friends, here's Magat Wade.

00:40.520 --> 00:42.940
 You were born in Senegal.

00:42.940 --> 00:45.480
 You have lived and traveled across the world.

00:45.480 --> 00:48.360
 So let me ask you, what is the soul of Senegal?

00:48.360 --> 00:51.840
 Like, its people, its culture, its history.

00:51.840 --> 00:55.880
 Can you try to sneak up on telling us

00:55.880 --> 00:58.160
 what is the spirit of its people?

00:58.160 --> 01:00.720
 Taranga, Taranga.

01:00.720 --> 01:02.840
 Taranga, it's a Wolof word.

01:02.840 --> 01:05.680
 Wolof is the main indigenous language of Senegal

01:05.680 --> 01:07.840
 and it means hospitality.

01:07.840 --> 01:11.560
 That is what us, the people of Senegal, are known for.

01:11.560 --> 01:14.160
 And it transpires in everything that we do,

01:15.360 --> 01:16.960
 everything that we say.

01:16.960 --> 01:19.880
 It's a place where, I guess with hospitality,

01:19.880 --> 01:21.700
 goes this concept of warmth.

01:21.700 --> 01:25.320
 So we are a very warm people.

01:25.320 --> 01:26.440
 So in a nutshell, that's us.

01:26.440 --> 01:28.600
 That's us, the place where you come

01:28.600 --> 01:31.440
 and everybody will just embrace you,

01:31.440 --> 01:32.920
 make you feel very comfortable,

01:32.920 --> 01:35.320
 make you feel like you're the only person in the world

01:35.320 --> 01:37.720
 and that we've been waiting for you our whole life, right?

01:37.720 --> 01:39.360
 So that's my country.

01:39.360 --> 01:43.160
 So that's for people in Senegal, people in Africa,

01:43.160 --> 01:45.720
 or also people across the world,

01:45.720 --> 01:47.680
 weird strangers from all walks of life.

01:47.680 --> 01:49.360
 So hospitality towards everyone.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.320
 For everyone, for everyone.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.280
 Especially towards the foreigner

01:54.280 --> 01:57.920
 because it's very ingrained in us,

01:57.920 --> 02:00.900
 this understanding that especially the foreigner,

02:00.900 --> 02:01.960
 the foreigner is called foreigner

02:01.960 --> 02:03.780
 because the foreigner is coming from somewhere else.

02:03.780 --> 02:07.080
 So if someone has taken the time and the energy,

02:07.080 --> 02:11.200
 whether in a forced manner or because it's a choice

02:11.200 --> 02:14.880
 to travel so far to come to a place that's not theirs,

02:14.880 --> 02:17.600
 to start where that's where the foreigners again,

02:17.600 --> 02:20.640
 then it is your duty to welcome them,

02:20.640 --> 02:23.080
 to be uber welcoming to them.

02:23.080 --> 02:24.960
 So there's not a fear of the foreigner.

02:24.960 --> 02:26.680
 There's not a suspicion of the foreigner.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.400
 No, no, no.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.320
 And I think this goes with the other way around.

02:31.320 --> 02:34.080
 Maybe it has to do with just,

02:34.080 --> 02:36.080
 you know, when you feel good about yourself,

02:36.080 --> 02:37.760
 when you're very grounded yourself,

02:37.760 --> 02:39.880
 it's very easy to open yourself to others.

02:39.880 --> 02:42.880
 And I'm wondering if that's not, you know,

02:42.880 --> 02:45.580
 the other side of the equation in a way.

02:45.580 --> 02:49.560
 So no, we don't have a fear towards a foreigner.

02:49.560 --> 02:50.400
 That's just no.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.880
 When you have a pride of your culture,

02:53.880 --> 02:56.840
 pride of your own people, it's easier to sort of embrace.

02:56.840 --> 02:59.120
 I mean, it's interesting how these kind of cultures emerge

02:59.120 --> 03:02.720
 because, you know, the Slavic countries

03:02.720 --> 03:05.460
 are sometimes colder.

03:05.460 --> 03:07.840
 They're slower to trust others.

03:07.840 --> 03:09.360
 We're now here in Austin, Texas.

03:09.360 --> 03:11.160
 One of the reasons I fell in love with this place

03:11.160 --> 03:13.860
 when I showed up is there's that same hospitality

03:13.860 --> 03:17.240
 as compared to other cities I've lived in,

03:17.240 --> 03:22.000
 sort of Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.560
 There's a hesitation to open up, to be fragile,

03:26.560 --> 03:31.280
 to be caring before understanding

03:31.280 --> 03:34.920
 what I can gain from you kind of calculation.

03:34.920 --> 03:35.760
 It's really interesting.

03:35.760 --> 03:39.200
 And I wonder how those kinds of dynamics emerge

03:39.200 --> 03:41.820
 because they're certainly parts of the world.

03:41.820 --> 03:43.240
 Like Austin is one of them

03:43.240 --> 03:45.040
 where you just feel the kindness,

03:45.040 --> 03:48.280
 just radiate without knowing kindness from strangers.

03:49.640 --> 03:52.760
 You know, if I were to advance one thing,

03:52.760 --> 03:54.920
 and I had the same experience

03:56.360 --> 03:59.520
 after having lived in San Francisco first,

03:59.520 --> 04:02.600
 then we went to New York, then we came to Austin.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.300
 And when we came to Austin, I felt,

04:04.300 --> 04:06.360
 it took me a while to put my finger on it,

04:06.360 --> 04:10.480
 but what I found in Austin, people just hang.

04:10.480 --> 04:11.940
 People, right?

04:11.940 --> 04:13.000
 They're real.

04:13.000 --> 04:13.840
 They're real.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.400
 And like what you were saying, I feel like

04:15.400 --> 04:18.640
 in these other places, people are,

04:18.640 --> 04:21.320
 it's a destination for people who want to come and perform.

04:21.320 --> 04:24.440
 I think maybe the early San Francisco people,

04:24.440 --> 04:25.740
 it was different for them.

04:26.960 --> 04:30.520
 But later as prosperity starts to come in

04:30.520 --> 04:34.040
 and success comes in, then you attract a different breed.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.160
 At first, we're the people who made it,

04:36.160 --> 04:38.920
 who made this place be what it is.

04:38.920 --> 04:41.960
 And then it attracts all the bling followers

04:41.960 --> 04:43.800
 and the bling attracted people.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.120
 And when those people show up,

04:45.120 --> 04:47.240
 it's time for all of us to get out.

04:47.240 --> 04:49.200
 And that's one of my worries about Austin too.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.400
 And I guess I'm one of, I count myself in it,

04:51.400 --> 04:54.840
 but you know, because we're also new arrivees,

04:54.840 --> 04:56.200
 always been furious now.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.920
 But how are we gonna protect this place?

04:58.920 --> 05:00.200
 Yeah.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.820
 Yeah, these are, you know, the best possible version

05:02.820 --> 05:04.300
 of the Austin history.

05:04.300 --> 05:07.120
 This is the early days of Silicon Valley in Austin.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.400
 And so you get a chance to build

05:09.400 --> 05:12.940
 on top of this culture that's already been here

05:12.940 --> 05:17.940
 of the weirdos, the artists, the sort of the characters,

05:18.760 --> 05:21.880
 but also the general kindness and love

05:21.880 --> 05:23.100
 that just permeates the whole place,

05:23.100 --> 05:27.500
 build on top of that entrepreneurial spirit.

05:27.500 --> 05:30.600
 So like the tech companies, new startups,

05:30.600 --> 05:31.760
 all that kind of stuff.

05:31.760 --> 05:35.440
 And then you get a chance to build totally new ideas,

05:35.440 --> 05:38.160
 totally revolutionary ideas and make them a reality

05:38.160 --> 05:40.280
 and dream big and build it here.

05:40.280 --> 05:44.400
 I think Elon represents that with all the people

05:44.400 --> 05:49.400
 that kind of try to do the cutting edge stuff

05:50.120 --> 05:52.460
 they're doing at Tesla and SpaceX.

05:52.460 --> 05:53.600
 But there's a bunch of other companies,

05:53.600 --> 05:54.980
 they're just like coming up.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.480
 I get to talk to a bunch of tech people

05:56.480 --> 05:58.120
 and they're just incredible.

05:58.120 --> 06:03.120
 Versus San Francisco, there's a cynicism a bit.

06:03.400 --> 06:06.420
 And also some of the interaction with strangers,

06:06.420 --> 06:08.200
 there's always a bit of a calculation,

06:08.200 --> 06:11.160
 like how good is this going to be for my career?

06:11.160 --> 06:12.080
 Or how can, yeah.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.720
 How can hanging out with this person can advance me?

06:14.720 --> 06:18.280
 You go to a party, they're seizing up.

06:18.280 --> 06:19.680
 It's like, I'm not gonna talk to so and so

06:19.680 --> 06:21.200
 because that's not gonna advance me.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.520
 Who's gonna advance me next?

06:22.520 --> 06:27.200
 And so this is what I would not wanna see here in Austin.

06:27.200 --> 06:30.120
 And I think maybe there's one way to try to,

06:30.120 --> 06:31.720
 I really would like to see Austin

06:31.720 --> 06:33.720
 not go the way San Francisco did

06:33.720 --> 06:34.560
 and other towns before.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.840
 I like how you pronounce San Francisco with a French accent.

06:36.840 --> 06:37.680
 San Francisco?

06:37.680 --> 06:39.880
 Yeah, that's great.

06:39.880 --> 06:42.080
 That's the one word you go with a French accent.

06:42.080 --> 06:42.920
 You have to.

06:42.920 --> 06:43.740
 It sounds beautiful.

06:43.740 --> 06:44.580
 San Francisco.

06:44.580 --> 06:45.760
 San Francisco.

06:45.760 --> 06:50.320
 But you know, so now that you find that cute,

06:50.320 --> 06:53.120
 you're gonna have to forgive me when I mess up my English

06:53.120 --> 06:55.240
 because English is not my first language.

06:55.240 --> 06:58.160
 So I always try to make sure people know that.

06:58.160 --> 07:01.040
 But you know Lex, this is why I am very interested

07:01.040 --> 07:03.760
 in what some folks here are working on.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.440
 And I'm just gonna be very selfish here

07:05.440 --> 07:07.880
 because I wanna help her with what she's doing.

07:07.880 --> 07:11.680
 It's someone like, you know, Nicole Nodzak and her project,

07:11.680 --> 07:14.500
 you know, with the housing project that they have right now,

07:14.500 --> 07:16.720
 making sure that Austin remains a town

07:16.720 --> 07:20.400
 that's affordable for people of all walks of lives.

07:20.400 --> 07:24.060
 If we can accomplish making sure that all walks of lives,

07:24.060 --> 07:28.260
 doesn't matter how little or big you're making money wise,

07:28.260 --> 07:29.560
 that you can stay in this town

07:29.560 --> 07:32.000
 so the diversity at that level can remain,

07:32.000 --> 07:34.960
 then I think Austin stands a chance to really show the world

07:34.960 --> 07:36.280
 how to do things differently.

07:36.280 --> 07:38.600
 And what I love about, you know, her initiative

07:38.600 --> 07:42.800
 is just how they're really trying, you know,

07:42.800 --> 07:46.920
 to again work on keeping affordability down for most people.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.840
 I think it's important to,

07:48.840 --> 07:50.360
 because it seems like it matters to you,

07:50.360 --> 07:51.840
 I know that it matters to me.

07:51.840 --> 07:55.320
 I absolutely would not wanna see Austin go away

07:55.320 --> 07:56.160
 that San Francisco did.

07:56.160 --> 07:58.560
 And I think the key to that is making sure

07:58.560 --> 07:59.480
 that true diversity,

07:59.480 --> 08:02.240
 not like the fluff, fluff crap diversity we're hearing over there.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.600
 And that's another thing by the way,

08:03.600 --> 08:05.720
 because San Francisco likes to pride itself in,

08:05.720 --> 08:09.200
 oh, you know, we are so into diversity,

08:09.200 --> 08:13.040
 but I'm like, if diversity for you means gender,

08:13.040 --> 08:16.560
 difference of gender, skin color, you know,

08:16.560 --> 08:18.120
 maybe the different accents we have,

08:18.120 --> 08:19.760
 and you think check, check, check, check, check,

08:19.760 --> 08:21.720
 I'm like, it's not enough.

08:21.720 --> 08:24.160
 Can we also add diversity of thoughts?

08:24.160 --> 08:26.040
 And that's the other problem I have with that place,

08:26.040 --> 08:26.880
 you know?

08:26.880 --> 08:29.920
 And I know some folks who are scared of saying much

08:29.920 --> 08:31.960
 around people, that's also another thing.

08:31.960 --> 08:33.680
 So not only they're sizing you up,

08:33.680 --> 08:36.720
 but everybody's also, there is this invisible,

08:36.720 --> 08:40.520
 this invisible, how should I say this?

08:40.520 --> 08:43.280
 There's this invisible agreement

08:43.280 --> 08:46.000
 that they all seem to have to stay on script.

08:47.080 --> 08:48.520
 Yeah, there's a feeling like you're following

08:48.520 --> 08:51.640
 a certain kind of script that's very kind of shallow.

08:51.640 --> 08:54.160
 And there is a bit of a categorization going on,

08:54.160 --> 08:55.720
 which category do you belong to?

08:55.720 --> 08:58.720
 And let's put this into a simple math equation,

08:58.720 --> 09:03.600
 what comes out, as opposed to just the free, open embrace

09:03.600 --> 09:06.840
 of people, the weirdos, the characters, the interesting,

09:06.840 --> 09:09.800
 the full, deep sense of diversity.

09:09.800 --> 09:14.800
 Not just ideas, but backgrounds, and rich and poor.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.400
 Artists, engineers.

09:17.400 --> 09:20.520
 High school dropouts, PhDs, all of this.

09:20.520 --> 09:24.520
 Yes, yes, that's what makes for a rich society

09:24.520 --> 09:25.760
 if it's gonna get ahead.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.520
 I'm glad you mentioned Nicole's efforts,

09:27.520 --> 09:29.400
 I know she really is passionate about.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.720
 I don't know how complicated that work is,

09:32.720 --> 09:37.720
 because there's probably a big force trying to increase

09:40.080 --> 09:42.080
 how much it costs to live in Austin.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.160
 I don't know how you resist that.

09:45.160 --> 09:47.040
 Whenever I go to New York City,

09:47.040 --> 09:50.720
 just the fact that there's a giant park in the middle of it,

09:50.720 --> 09:53.240
 I wonder, how did they pull this off?

09:53.240 --> 09:54.680
 This is amazing.

09:54.680 --> 09:59.240
 It's like to resist the force of the increasing price

09:59.240 --> 10:02.200
 of the land, and still to protect this idea

10:02.200 --> 10:05.040
 of having a park.

10:05.040 --> 10:08.560
 And then in the same way, protecting the ability

10:08.560 --> 10:10.360
 for people from all walks of life to live

10:10.360 --> 10:13.240
 in the center of the city, to live around the city,

10:13.240 --> 10:16.880
 to chase a dream when they don't get any money

10:16.880 --> 10:17.720
 in their pocket.

10:17.720 --> 10:18.560
 Absolutely.

10:18.560 --> 10:19.400
 I don't know how you do that.

10:19.400 --> 10:22.280
 It's partly political, probably, regulation,

10:22.280 --> 10:23.120
 all that kind of stuff.

10:23.120 --> 10:25.800
 A lot of it has to do with regulations.

10:25.800 --> 10:30.800
 And this is where her and I also very much see eye to eye

10:31.120 --> 10:35.560
 in terms of the free markets and also prosperity building,

10:35.560 --> 10:38.840
 because it's always the same problems most of the time,

10:38.840 --> 10:40.200
 most places.

10:40.200 --> 10:43.240
 Here, what you have is some people in the name of,

10:43.240 --> 10:47.440
 we gotta stand for, and I don't like to use this word,

10:47.440 --> 10:49.680
 but maybe you help me find a better one,

10:49.680 --> 10:51.840
 but at least that's a word that people can understand.

10:51.840 --> 10:54.440
 We gotta stand for the lesser fortunate among us.

10:54.440 --> 10:57.040
 Some people would call them, maybe oftentimes use the word,

10:57.040 --> 10:58.360
 maybe the underdogs, whatever it is.

10:58.360 --> 11:01.400
 I will just say maybe the lesser fortunate among us, right?

11:02.440 --> 11:04.280
 In the name of standing up for them,

11:04.280 --> 11:07.640
 you're promoting policies that are actually gonna backfire

11:07.640 --> 11:10.000
 and where they end up being the first ones

11:10.000 --> 11:11.080
 to suffer from it.

11:11.080 --> 11:14.040
 So let's take this whole housing issue

11:14.040 --> 11:16.200
 that Nicole and her team are working on.

11:17.360 --> 11:20.320
 We find that oftentimes the cost at the end of the day,

11:20.320 --> 11:25.320
 it's the good old supply and demand equation.

11:26.160 --> 11:29.280
 If you're gonna make it so hard

11:29.280 --> 11:33.200
 that the supply level of housing remains

11:33.200 --> 11:34.960
 below a certain threshold,

11:34.960 --> 11:38.560
 remains lower than the demand of people who need,

11:38.560 --> 11:41.480
 especially affordable housing, housing altogether,

11:41.480 --> 11:45.600
 what's gonna happen is scarcity, prices go up,

11:45.600 --> 11:47.360
 and who gets kicked out first?

11:47.360 --> 11:49.360
 The lesser fortunate among us.

11:49.360 --> 11:52.480
 And so, but I find that oftentimes people

11:52.480 --> 11:55.400
 in the name of We Care don't engage their mind.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.840
 And a friend of mine said this, and he said it so well.

11:57.840 --> 12:02.840
 He said, having a heart for the poor, that's easy.

12:03.360 --> 12:06.200
 Having a mind for the poor, that's the challenge.

12:06.200 --> 12:09.920
 And oftentimes we all have a heart for the poor.

12:09.920 --> 12:13.200
 But when it comes then to, then what do we do

12:13.200 --> 12:17.000
 to have a real impact on making sure

12:17.000 --> 12:20.800
 that people get a chance at going up,

12:20.800 --> 12:23.280
 then that's where everything starts falling apart.

12:23.280 --> 12:25.640
 And then you have people who,

12:25.640 --> 12:28.480
 then they start pushing for policies, housing policies,

12:28.480 --> 12:30.760
 making it super hard for you to even renovate

12:30.760 --> 12:33.720
 or add one more store to your home or anything like that.

12:33.720 --> 12:36.000
 By doing that, you're messing up with the supply,

12:36.000 --> 12:39.120
 with the supply of housing.

12:39.120 --> 12:43.000
 And therefore the people who can't afford,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.080
 people get priced out of the market.

12:45.080 --> 12:47.080
 And so what people like Nicole are doing

12:47.080 --> 12:49.280
 are going back to where all of this is taking place

12:49.280 --> 12:51.200
 and they're going back to the regulation side.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.360
 And just like, I'm sure we'll talk about it here,

12:53.360 --> 12:56.120
 but people wonder today, why is Africa

12:56.120 --> 12:57.920
 the poorest region in the world?

12:57.920 --> 12:59.960
 We go back to the same culprit.

12:59.960 --> 13:04.560
 Bad laws and tons of senseless regulations.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.920
 If you make it so hard that in Berkeley,

13:06.920 --> 13:09.320
 for someone to build one more store to their home,

13:09.320 --> 13:11.800
 which means maybe one more unit

13:11.800 --> 13:13.360
 that could be rented out to someone.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.560
 And if many more people do that,

13:14.560 --> 13:16.520
 then you have a much bigger supply,

13:16.520 --> 13:18.240
 which means the prices will go down,

13:18.240 --> 13:20.680
 which means more people have access and among them,

13:20.680 --> 13:22.880
 especially the lesser fortunate among us,

13:22.880 --> 13:25.480
 then we're starting to see a winning proposal, aren't we?

13:25.480 --> 13:27.360
 But instead, if you go the other way around,

13:27.360 --> 13:29.320
 then all of a sudden you're pricing them out of the market.

13:29.320 --> 13:30.320
 Same thing was done with us.

13:30.320 --> 13:33.480
 So oftentimes when I see problems of this nature,

13:33.480 --> 13:37.040
 you can betcha that regulations and census laws

13:37.040 --> 13:37.880
 are the heart of it.

13:37.880 --> 13:39.480
 And that's what they're tackling.

13:39.480 --> 13:41.640
 It's not popular, it's not fun.

13:41.640 --> 13:43.280
 And people tend to not even understand

13:43.280 --> 13:44.440
 where you're coming from.

13:44.440 --> 13:45.480
 But this is a problem we have

13:45.480 --> 13:48.800
 with people not understanding economic econ 101.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.440
 Well, so it's the regulation and the laws

13:50.440 --> 13:51.760
 and the system that props them up

13:51.760 --> 13:53.840
 and increases the span of those laws.

13:53.840 --> 13:55.160
 And we'll talk about that,

13:55.160 --> 13:57.880
 the fascinating way those kinds of things develop

13:57.880 --> 13:59.680
 when it works, when it doesn't.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.480
 Let me sort of step back

14:01.480 --> 14:03.160
 and ask you a question about Africa.

14:03.160 --> 14:06.920
 In the West, in many places in the world,

14:06.920 --> 14:10.600
 Africa is almost talked about like it's one country,

14:10.600 --> 14:12.200
 like it's one place.

14:12.200 --> 14:16.640
 So in what ways is Africa one community?

14:16.640 --> 14:20.040
 And in what ways is it many, many, many communities?

14:20.040 --> 14:24.600
 Just from your perspective from in Senegal and beyond.

14:24.600 --> 14:25.880
 Right.

14:25.880 --> 14:30.880
 So at the most basic of what makes us one

14:30.880 --> 14:33.240
 goes back to even what makes you African.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.880
 You are African, I'm African.

14:34.880 --> 14:36.440
 We're one big family.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.240
 Africa is very much at the end of the day,

14:38.240 --> 14:43.240
 the foundation and the birth of the human race.

14:44.280 --> 14:47.600
 So from that standpoint, at the most basic level,

14:47.600 --> 14:48.440
 we're all Africans.

14:48.440 --> 14:50.040
 Where this whole thing started.

14:50.040 --> 14:51.640
 Exactly, exactly.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.160
 Where this whole thing started

14:53.160 --> 14:56.600
 and how at some point humanity was hanging

14:56.600 --> 14:57.600
 by its fingernails.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.880
 Only 2000 of us were left on this earth.

14:59.880 --> 15:02.200
 And eventually we started, we went for survival.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.280
 And that's how we started to spread around

15:04.280 --> 15:07.360
 and some going up north, some going this way, that way.

15:07.360 --> 15:09.680
 And as you're traveling to different places

15:09.680 --> 15:11.920
 then features start to change to adapt

15:11.920 --> 15:13.640
 to where you are, right?

15:13.640 --> 15:16.160
 So hair gets lighter for some people,

15:16.160 --> 15:19.160
 eyes get different shape for others to adjust

15:19.160 --> 15:21.280
 to our new natural habitat.

15:21.280 --> 15:22.720
 You know, the genomics program,

15:22.720 --> 15:26.960
 I think at the National Geographic did that so well

15:26.960 --> 15:28.200
 for people who are interested in going back

15:28.200 --> 15:30.320
 to that work with Spencer Wells and such.

15:30.320 --> 15:34.040
 But yeah, so at the very basic, most basic level,

15:34.040 --> 15:37.040
 that's what unites us all first of all.

15:37.040 --> 15:41.560
 And then I would say that the continent, especially here

15:41.560 --> 15:45.080
 I will group it into black Africa, you know, black Africa.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.600
 Unfortunately our common stories, you know,

15:50.600 --> 15:54.240
 of having gone through this terrible, horrible period

15:54.240 --> 15:56.720
 of around the same time the whole continent being,

15:56.720 --> 15:58.480
 you know, enslaved and colonized.

15:58.480 --> 16:02.200
 So that in a way forms, not that we were ever

16:02.200 --> 16:05.120
 the first people or only people ever, you know,

16:05.120 --> 16:06.320
 enslaved in this world.

16:06.320 --> 16:09.240
 As a matter of fact, I mean, the word slaves comes

16:09.240 --> 16:13.320
 from esclav, you know, esclav, slave, slavs, les slavs,

16:13.320 --> 16:15.040
 right, from the Eastern block.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.000
 So the first slaves were actually people looking

16:17.000 --> 16:19.360
 more like you than looking like me, right?

16:19.360 --> 16:22.560
 So, but we don't necessarily remember all of that

16:22.560 --> 16:27.560
 because in our human psyche, the closest to us in history

16:28.160 --> 16:32.640
 of a big mass of people being enslaved is African people.

16:32.640 --> 16:35.760
 We were the last, you know, group like that.

16:35.760 --> 16:39.080
 You know, the pain of World War I and World War II

16:39.080 --> 16:43.720
 permeates Europe, but it certainly does

16:43.720 --> 16:46.360
 for the former Soviet Union, the countries

16:46.360 --> 16:48.200
 that made up the former Soviet Union.

16:48.200 --> 16:53.200
 Does in the same way, the pain of slavery

16:56.760 --> 17:01.240
 and empires using Africa, does that permeate the culture?

17:01.240 --> 17:02.960
 Is there still echoes of that?

17:02.960 --> 17:06.440
 In a way, yes, especially the fact that, you know,

17:06.440 --> 17:10.280
 in many different places, whether it's Ghana

17:10.280 --> 17:15.080
 or my country or Benin, where you have these places

17:15.080 --> 17:17.640
 that we call the door of no return or the places

17:17.640 --> 17:22.440
 of no return, which this was the last place

17:22.440 --> 17:25.800
 where the slaves were standing or, you know,

17:25.800 --> 17:29.040
 this is in Senegal, we call it the door of no return.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.680
 There is this one door, you're there in the slave house.

17:31.680 --> 17:34.600
 And once they go, they go, that's it.

17:34.600 --> 17:37.160
 That's gonna be the last time they see back home.

17:38.600 --> 17:43.360
 So, you know, those, of course, of course,

17:43.360 --> 17:48.360
 it creates for a common lived experience,

17:48.680 --> 17:52.640
 which becomes a common lived history.

17:54.720 --> 17:56.760
 And of course, it's gonna tire us up.

17:56.760 --> 18:00.480
 Is there a resentment, because you mentioned hospitality,

18:00.480 --> 18:03.520
 is there a kind of a resentment of the foreigner

18:03.520 --> 18:07.040
 that there's a rich, vibrant land?

18:07.040 --> 18:10.480
 There's many resources, there's powerful cultures.

18:10.480 --> 18:14.000
 Are they just going to show up and use us?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.960
 That's a way to see geopolitics in this modern world.

18:16.960 --> 18:19.800
 This is, okay, so where it plays very differently is,

18:19.800 --> 18:21.360
 so if you came to Senegal today,

18:21.360 --> 18:23.960
 there is not really a problem at that level.

18:23.960 --> 18:28.280
 Where people's resentment start to come from is,

18:28.280 --> 18:31.160
 of course, when bad behavior shows up,

18:31.160 --> 18:33.840
 meaning like you have so many white people who can show up

18:33.840 --> 18:35.320
 and just in the attitude,

18:35.320 --> 18:38.640
 they have an entitlement attitude, right?

18:38.640 --> 18:43.240
 And they think that in a way, we're all still servants.

18:43.240 --> 18:46.080
 Some people in your face, some people more,

18:46.080 --> 18:48.320
 but that can cause some little resentment,

18:48.320 --> 18:50.160
 but where really the resentment is.

18:51.320 --> 18:53.520
 And that can, the entitlement can take different forms,

18:53.520 --> 18:55.160
 like even pity.

18:55.160 --> 18:57.440
 Yes, don't even get me going on that one.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.120
 I was trying to be polite today.

18:59.120 --> 19:01.840
 So just don't, Lex, do not.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.080
 You know, sometimes I tell myself,

19:03.080 --> 19:04.760
 my God, today you're going to be all composed.

19:04.760 --> 19:06.720
 You know, Lex is all composed.

19:06.720 --> 19:08.280
 So don't go there and make a fool of yourself.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.320
 Just behave.

19:09.320 --> 19:12.400
 But if you get me on some grounds,

19:12.400 --> 19:15.120
 that's when it's all going to go to hell.

19:15.120 --> 19:17.840
 So yeah, let's move beyond that too.

19:17.840 --> 19:20.080
 So resentment, there's a dance

19:20.080 --> 19:21.440
 between hospitality and resentment.

19:21.440 --> 19:22.400
 And resentment.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.240
 So when you come in, you're you, you live your life.

19:25.240 --> 19:26.840
 You're just a normal human being

19:26.840 --> 19:27.880
 and you treat me decently

19:27.880 --> 19:30.120
 like you would treat a friend, normal people.

19:30.120 --> 19:31.200
 I have no problem with you.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.280
 I'm not going to come back and be like,

19:32.280 --> 19:35.680
 well, you and your ancestors have enslaved me.

19:35.680 --> 19:38.240
 You, you're not going to see that stuff.

19:38.240 --> 19:40.520
 Sometimes I'm in this country where I feel like that's,

19:40.520 --> 19:42.560
 you know, it might look like that,

19:42.560 --> 19:45.560
 but we in Africa don't do that.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.640
 Now, if you come, you have this nasty attitude.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.240
 You think you're still serving servants around.

19:50.240 --> 19:52.000
 Well, you can have a problem with someone like me.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
 I might even grab you by the back of your neck

19:54.000 --> 19:56.040
 and, you know, take you back to the airport.

19:56.040 --> 19:57.240
 That's when you're lucky.

19:58.560 --> 19:59.960
 I'll be you very quickly.

19:59.960 --> 20:00.800
 Exactly.

20:00.800 --> 20:05.000
 But where things come up is,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.760
 especially nowadays with the African youth,

20:07.760 --> 20:10.520
 when we have to be reminded of the World Bank,

20:10.520 --> 20:13.360
 when we have to be reminded of even the world,

20:13.360 --> 20:14.640
 places like the World Economic Forum,

20:14.640 --> 20:17.640
 you know, like all of these places that seem to constitute,

20:19.880 --> 20:22.120
 they would, the way they describe them,

20:22.120 --> 20:26.200
 when I say they, it's primarily my Pan African friends.

20:26.200 --> 20:29.280
 So here maybe terms are worth describing.

20:30.480 --> 20:35.480
 So the Pan African movement goes way back when,

20:37.280 --> 20:39.680
 we're talking about, you know, way back when,

20:39.680 --> 20:44.680
 started in the thirties going on all the way from there.

20:44.760 --> 20:47.800
 So what you have there is people

20:47.800 --> 20:50.680
 who have started coming together

20:50.680 --> 20:54.240
 and dreaming up an emancipated Africa

20:54.240 --> 20:55.840
 away from the colonies,

20:55.840 --> 20:57.960
 because at that point there were still colonies

20:57.960 --> 20:59.440
 and dreaming up all of that.

20:59.440 --> 21:02.560
 So we're talking about people like Kwame Kuma of Ghana,

21:02.560 --> 21:04.840
 we're talking about Julius Nyerere of Tanzania,

21:04.840 --> 21:06.920
 talking about Blaise Diagne of Senegal

21:06.920 --> 21:09.520
 and other people like that, Bandi of Malawi.

21:09.520 --> 21:12.960
 So anyway, so, and the African youth of today,

21:12.960 --> 21:15.240
 we're still hanging on to those,

21:15.240 --> 21:16.800
 onto some of these ideas of,

21:16.800 --> 21:19.880
 and on some of these dreams of a reunited Africa.

21:19.880 --> 21:22.880
 So when you were talking about what seems to unite you,

21:22.880 --> 21:25.200
 there is that, you know, also,

21:25.200 --> 21:27.960
 meaning like we all feel like we're part of the same family.

21:27.960 --> 21:29.320
 Is it only in our heads?

21:29.320 --> 21:30.160
 Is it in reality?

21:30.160 --> 21:31.640
 Many, for many different reasons,

21:31.640 --> 21:34.400
 there is definitely what we call a Pan African movement.

21:34.400 --> 21:38.400
 And I very much myself, consider myself one of them.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.480
 I don't agree all the time with our,

21:40.480 --> 21:42.880
 where we want to go and how we want to go there,

21:42.880 --> 21:45.320
 but not where we want to go.

21:45.320 --> 21:46.920
 Where we want to go is we would love to see

21:46.920 --> 21:48.640
 a united Africa for sure.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.360
 But how to get that accomplished,

21:50.360 --> 21:52.440
 that's where oftentimes we have issues.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.440
 So on something like that,

21:55.440 --> 21:57.760
 so this Pan African, especially the Pan African youth,

21:57.760 --> 21:59.840
 but it's beyond the Pan African youth,

21:59.840 --> 22:02.440
 it's the youth in general in Africa,

22:02.440 --> 22:04.960
 World Bank, UN, all of these organizations

22:04.960 --> 22:09.600
 that they tend to qualify as imperialist organizations.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.320
 And it's not always a correct way to describe them,

22:12.320 --> 22:14.440
 but I'm sure you get the sentiment.

22:14.440 --> 22:19.440
 And from that place, there is tons of resentment

22:19.800 --> 22:22.000
 because for the longest time,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.680
 these groups, organizations,

22:24.680 --> 22:27.160
 and some that preceded them,

22:27.160 --> 22:30.600
 have proceeded to actually decide

22:30.600 --> 22:32.600
 what even our new frontiers would be.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.640
 You see, when you go to a place like Senegal,

22:35.640 --> 22:37.720
 Mali, all of that, different countries,

22:37.720 --> 22:39.040
 but we were one people,

22:40.160 --> 22:42.400
 one group, one kingdom.

22:42.400 --> 22:45.400
 And then at some point they decided just,

22:45.400 --> 22:46.240
 when you look at Africa,

22:46.240 --> 22:48.960
 have you looked at how straight some of these borders are?

22:48.960 --> 22:51.320
 You're like, did a robot just draw these?

22:51.320 --> 22:52.160
 Really?

22:52.160 --> 22:53.000
 No offense to robots.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.520
 No offense to robot, especially this one,

22:54.520 --> 22:55.400
 he looks so cute.

22:55.400 --> 22:56.520
 But you know what I mean?

22:56.520 --> 23:01.520
 So they have continued deciding

23:02.680 --> 23:06.440
 what it would be to be us,

23:06.440 --> 23:08.440
 to live on our land,

23:08.440 --> 23:10.240
 and how do we even progress?

23:10.240 --> 23:11.880
 And it just keeps on going.

23:11.880 --> 23:16.800
 They get to decide how are we gonna,

23:16.800 --> 23:19.120
 which type of even economic development path

23:19.120 --> 23:20.440
 are we gonna choose or not?

23:20.440 --> 23:22.600
 So it's very, so from that standpoint,

23:22.600 --> 23:23.920
 yes, there's a lot of resentment,

23:23.920 --> 23:25.680
 including even from people like me.

23:25.680 --> 23:27.520
 Yeah, and it's interesting that the invader

23:27.520 --> 23:29.520
 and the oppressor and the empires

23:29.520 --> 23:33.240
 have actually created a force for unity.

23:33.240 --> 23:36.920
 I've seen that in Ukraine and the invasion of Ukraine,

23:36.920 --> 23:38.760
 where it was a pretty divided,

23:38.760 --> 23:41.680
 not a pretty, a very divided country with many factions.

23:41.680 --> 23:45.800
 But the invasion really forced everyone to think

23:45.800 --> 23:48.760
 about the identity of this nation together,

23:48.760 --> 23:51.200
 beyond factions, beyond all of that.

23:51.200 --> 23:54.800
 It allowed it to look at its history and its future.

23:54.800 --> 23:57.520
 Like they all say that all great nations

23:57.520 --> 24:00.560
 have had to have a war of independence.

24:00.560 --> 24:04.640
 And this is our war to find our own identity.

24:04.640 --> 24:09.360
 And so in that sense, Africa as one place,

24:09.360 --> 24:14.360
 as one continent had to find multiple times its identity

24:14.800 --> 24:17.200
 through the resistance of the oppressor.

24:17.200 --> 24:18.840
 Especially subterranean Africa,

24:18.840 --> 24:20.680
 especially subterranean Africa, yes.

24:20.680 --> 24:22.080
 And there's an interesting aspect to this

24:22.080 --> 24:23.920
 because the president of Senegal is also

24:23.920 --> 24:26.880
 the head of the African Union.

24:26.880 --> 24:30.120
 So we'll talk about the fascinating geopolitics

24:30.120 --> 24:33.520
 of that whole situation.

24:33.520 --> 24:36.120
 But let me ask in general,

24:36.120 --> 24:41.120
 you talk about this question, this fascinating question,

24:41.200 --> 24:43.440
 what does it take for a country to prosper?

24:44.880 --> 24:48.000
 What does it take for a country to prosper?

24:48.000 --> 24:51.960
 You see many countries in the world that really struggle

24:51.960 --> 24:54.520
 and many that flourish.

24:54.520 --> 24:56.880
 And it's not always obvious why

24:56.880 --> 25:00.360
 because some have natural resources, some don't.

25:00.360 --> 25:04.960
 Some have wars, some don't.

25:04.960 --> 25:09.960
 Some have sort of authoritarian regimes, some don't.

25:11.080 --> 25:13.480
 And some have democracies and all that kind of stuff.

25:13.480 --> 25:16.160
 So the dynamics aren't exactly obvious.

25:16.160 --> 25:18.200
 Is there commonalities?

25:18.200 --> 25:22.720
 Is there fundamental ideas that result

25:22.720 --> 25:24.800
 in a prosperity of a nation?

25:24.800 --> 25:27.440
 Today, I can confidently say yes,

25:27.440 --> 25:29.880
 despite all the differences that you talked about.

25:29.880 --> 25:33.320
 And I think then this is where it becomes very important

25:33.320 --> 25:37.320
 that we are very clear about the question you asked me.

25:37.320 --> 25:41.720
 You said, what does it take to make a country prosperous?

25:41.720 --> 25:44.240
 So I'm just gonna stick to prosperity

25:44.240 --> 25:46.960
 because prosperity doesn't necessarily mean,

25:46.960 --> 25:50.080
 sometimes it has nothing to do with maybe how

25:50.080 --> 25:55.080
 you conduct yourself otherwise, socially speaking, right?

25:56.080 --> 25:58.680
 So you can be prosperous.

25:58.680 --> 26:02.080
 And still when it comes to your family laws,

26:02.080 --> 26:04.560
 all the way you approach the other aspects of your life,

26:04.560 --> 26:07.760
 maybe you're running a very communist lifestyle

26:08.960 --> 26:13.960
 or you're in a very liberal society.

26:14.760 --> 26:16.560
 So for me, when we talk about prosperity,

26:16.560 --> 26:18.480
 I just want to make sure that we're clear on that

26:18.480 --> 26:19.920
 because some people might say that,

26:19.920 --> 26:21.400
 might be somewhere and be like,

26:21.400 --> 26:25.000
 well, because I know what I'm gonna talk to you about next.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.080
 And some people are gonna sit there and be like,

26:26.080 --> 26:27.640
 well, China is not like that.

26:27.640 --> 26:32.560
 Or even Dubai is not like that.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.520
 No, so what I'm talking about is this thing.

26:34.520 --> 26:35.600
 And that's what I love about this.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.600
 If we just stick to the word prosperity.

26:37.600 --> 26:38.920
 To me, I see prosperity as this.

26:38.920 --> 26:40.400
 It's like, economically speaking,

26:40.400 --> 26:43.040
 what are we gonna be to be a prosperous nation?

26:43.040 --> 26:46.680
 Meaning we are a middle to high income nation.

26:46.680 --> 26:50.160
 I'm not talking about what are the rights of your women

26:50.160 --> 26:54.200
 to vote or can people live like this?

26:54.200 --> 26:56.600
 Or I'm not talking about any of that.

26:56.600 --> 27:00.200
 Economic, fundamentally economic prosperity.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.960
 Because I think that distinction is very important

27:01.960 --> 27:03.000
 because over the years,

27:03.000 --> 27:05.200
 I've seen people push back on all types of things

27:05.200 --> 27:06.320
 and it occurred to me

27:06.320 --> 27:08.720
 that that's what the misunderstanding was there.

27:08.720 --> 27:11.120
 So if we're gonna talk about prosperity,

27:11.120 --> 27:13.160
 making sure that the country can make money

27:13.160 --> 27:15.000
 so that it can take care of its needs

27:15.000 --> 27:17.320
 and the needs of its citizens,

27:17.320 --> 27:22.320
 then what I have come to find is that at the root of that

27:22.640 --> 27:25.400
 is gonna be what we call economic freedom

27:25.400 --> 27:28.280
 and what I call the toolkit of the entrepreneur.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.360
 In that you can put the rule of law,

27:30.360 --> 27:32.120
 you can put the concept of clear

27:32.120 --> 27:34.080
 and transferable property rights.

27:34.960 --> 27:37.840
 Economic freedom is at all the levels

27:37.840 --> 27:41.600
 that which will allow entrepreneurs

27:42.600 --> 27:46.960
 and business people to create value

27:46.960 --> 27:48.840
 and create value entrepreneurially.

27:48.840 --> 27:51.040
 We're not talking about rent seeking or anything like that.

27:51.040 --> 27:53.400
 It's like you found a pie to be this big

27:53.400 --> 27:55.680
 and you make it this big.

27:55.680 --> 27:56.640
 So that's what we're talking about.

27:56.640 --> 27:57.560
 Create value.

27:57.560 --> 27:59.600
 Create value, yes.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.560
 So when it comes to that,

28:02.560 --> 28:07.360
 we have found that whether you're looking at two countries

28:07.360 --> 28:08.520
 that start out the same,

28:08.520 --> 28:10.240
 we're talking the same people,

28:10.240 --> 28:12.760
 East Germany, West Germany,

28:12.760 --> 28:15.000
 South Korea, North Korea,

28:15.920 --> 28:18.960
 very similar people to start with, right?

28:18.960 --> 28:23.840
 But yet radical outcomes.

28:23.840 --> 28:26.040
 I know that today Germany is united,

28:26.040 --> 28:27.440
 but we're talking about back in the days

28:27.440 --> 28:29.320
 when you had East and Western block.

28:30.480 --> 28:32.720
 Same people, very different outcomes.

28:32.720 --> 28:35.760
 Like I said, South Korea, North Korea,

28:35.760 --> 28:36.800
 and so on and so forth.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.800
 And at the same time, very different nations.

28:40.720 --> 28:45.720
 Dubai compared to Singapore or to England,

28:45.720 --> 28:48.800
 very different yet the same outcome.

28:48.800 --> 28:51.880
 So it seems to me like whenever we're looking at prosperity,

28:51.880 --> 28:53.800
 if a nation is prosperous,

28:53.800 --> 28:57.160
 regardless of whatever other shenanigan

28:57.160 --> 28:58.120
 they might be running,

28:58.120 --> 29:01.280
 whatever other operating software

29:01.280 --> 29:03.080
 they might be running for anything

29:03.080 --> 29:05.600
 that's not related to business,

29:05.600 --> 29:07.400
 if on the business side,

29:08.200 --> 29:11.200
 they are proponents of a free markets

29:11.200 --> 29:16.200
 or at least a base level of free markets,

29:16.600 --> 29:19.880
 we know that such countries will create prosperity.

29:19.880 --> 29:21.760
 So what are the aspects of the operating systems

29:21.760 --> 29:25.240
 that lead to Singapore and to South Korea

29:25.240 --> 29:26.200
 and all that kind of stuff?

29:26.200 --> 29:28.440
 So can you speak to different elements

29:28.440 --> 29:30.320
 that enable the toolkit for entrepreneurs?

29:30.320 --> 29:31.800
 Sure, sure.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.200
 And maybe here,

29:34.080 --> 29:36.560
 let me just maybe illustrate it with my own story

29:36.560 --> 29:38.640
 and then I can take you back to...

29:38.640 --> 29:39.480
 Yeah, what's your...

29:39.480 --> 29:42.480
 Oh my God, tell us your story.

29:42.480 --> 29:43.320
 No, no.

29:43.320 --> 29:44.160
 Who are you?

29:44.160 --> 29:45.640
 It's just because it started with me coming here.

29:45.640 --> 29:46.720
 You showed me the robot and everything

29:46.720 --> 29:49.000
 and now it looks like we know each other for too long.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.800
 And then you're like, tell people.

29:50.800 --> 29:51.640
 No, no, no.

29:51.640 --> 29:54.720
 But so this is where this question,

29:54.720 --> 29:55.760
 even when you asked me,

29:55.760 --> 29:59.160
 how do some countries become prosperous?

30:00.160 --> 30:05.160
 That question, Lex, I had it when I was seven or so.

30:05.160 --> 30:09.440
 That's when my family moved me to South Korea

30:09.440 --> 30:12.120
 to from Senegal for the first time of my life,

30:12.120 --> 30:14.400
 I left my country, I left my continent

30:14.400 --> 30:17.360
 and I was headed to Europe to go join my people,

30:17.360 --> 30:21.800
 my family, my parents who were there as economic migrants.

30:21.800 --> 30:24.600
 My parents had migrated for a better life

30:24.600 --> 30:27.080
 as so many people have to,

30:27.080 --> 30:29.880
 so many people have to coming from poorer places,

30:29.880 --> 30:31.360
 coming from low income countries.

30:31.360 --> 30:32.680
 You saw the difference?

30:32.680 --> 30:33.520
 Yes.

30:33.520 --> 30:34.680
 Between the two places.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.240
 How else would you call it?

30:37.240 --> 30:38.960
 Here you are in Senegal,

30:38.960 --> 30:40.120
 minding your own business,

30:40.120 --> 30:42.160
 causing tons of trouble everywhere,

30:42.160 --> 30:45.440
 just being a happy free wrench kid that I was.

30:45.440 --> 30:48.440
 Yeah, so you were always a troublemaker, not just now.

30:48.440 --> 30:49.280
 Okay, great.

30:49.280 --> 30:50.120
 Life wouldn't be fun without it.

30:50.120 --> 30:51.680
 Yeah, of course, I agree.

30:51.680 --> 30:52.520
 Right?

30:52.520 --> 30:53.360
 So, because even you,

30:53.360 --> 30:55.720
 and you're all put together front,

30:55.720 --> 30:57.920
 I know there's a lot of troublemaking behind you.

30:57.920 --> 30:59.840
 Desperately trying to keep it together.

30:59.840 --> 31:01.280
 I know you are, but with me,

31:01.280 --> 31:02.600
 I'm gonna totally bring it out.

31:02.600 --> 31:03.920
 So just, yeah.

31:03.920 --> 31:04.760
 So.

31:04.760 --> 31:05.600
 So you saw the difference.

31:05.600 --> 31:06.600
 Right, I saw the difference.

31:06.600 --> 31:09.320
 I'm walking in here, back home,

31:09.320 --> 31:10.360
 and I tell people this story

31:10.360 --> 31:13.400
 because to me it's a defining story.

31:13.400 --> 31:18.240
 Back home, to take a shower, it takes time.

31:18.240 --> 31:21.760
 Grandma has to make the charcoal catch

31:21.760 --> 31:25.680
 on a little stove like you use when you go camping.

31:25.680 --> 31:28.640
 And then she puts a pot of water on it, it boils.

31:28.640 --> 31:30.640
 She takes it, puts it in a bigger bucket,

31:30.640 --> 31:32.400
 mixes it with some colder water.

31:32.400 --> 31:34.400
 Then we put a little pot in it,

31:34.400 --> 31:36.080
 and a stronger member of the family

31:36.080 --> 31:37.720
 has to drag it to the shower.

31:37.720 --> 31:40.760
 And then there, finally, I can proceed to take my shower.

31:42.040 --> 31:43.760
 Here I'm in Germany in the middle of the winter,

31:43.760 --> 31:44.600
 and my mom's like,

31:44.600 --> 31:45.680
 my god, time for your shower.

31:45.680 --> 31:47.400
 I'm like, I'm not getting naked.

31:47.400 --> 31:48.240
 Where is the bottle?

31:48.240 --> 31:51.240
 Where is the bucket of hot water?

31:51.240 --> 31:53.640
 She's like, oh, you silly, come on, just jump in.

31:53.640 --> 31:55.760
 And I jump in the shower, turn the buttons,

31:55.760 --> 31:56.960
 the water is coming down temperature.

31:56.960 --> 31:58.280
 I'm like playing with.

31:58.280 --> 32:00.240
 It's like, are you kidding me?

32:00.240 --> 32:01.080
 So amazing.

32:01.080 --> 32:03.520
 I've been cheated out of life my whole life.

32:03.520 --> 32:05.040
 So that's what happened.

32:05.040 --> 32:08.480
 And then I'm like, oh, and all of these roads,

32:08.480 --> 32:09.360
 they're paved roads.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.920
 And like back home, everything is like sandy,

32:11.920 --> 32:13.640
 and my feet are always ash.

32:13.640 --> 32:16.160
 I always have to wash off when I go back home,

32:16.160 --> 32:18.480
 and your shoes get ruined most of the time.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.200
 And it started, and I had this question,

32:22.200 --> 32:25.160
 and it was just like, wow, how come they have this?

32:25.160 --> 32:26.720
 And we don't.

32:26.720 --> 32:28.840
 So I was not being like, oh, you know,

32:28.840 --> 32:30.440
 how come they have all of this money?

32:30.440 --> 32:32.600
 I was not, it was just like, how come?

32:32.600 --> 32:34.760
 And I think what I was alluding to was,

32:34.760 --> 32:39.240
 how come life is so easy here, and back home it's not?

32:39.240 --> 32:43.240
 And easy, not in a negative sense, in a beautiful sense.

32:43.240 --> 32:46.200
 Sometimes I get, you know, just having traveled

32:46.200 --> 32:48.120
 through the war zone, just to come back,

32:48.120 --> 32:50.640
 traveling through Europe, back to America,

32:50.640 --> 32:53.040
 it just, I'll just get emotional just looking

32:53.040 --> 32:56.520
 at the efficiency of things, like how easy it is,

32:56.520 --> 33:00.400
 how we can, first of all, in Ukraine,

33:00.400 --> 33:02.320
 you currently can't fly, right?

33:02.320 --> 33:03.200
 It's a war zone.

33:03.200 --> 33:06.360
 Just even the transportation, you said roads.

33:06.360 --> 33:09.480
 Yeah, the quality of roads in the United States is amazing.

33:09.480 --> 33:11.680
 Just not, you know, many of the places

33:11.680 --> 33:14.880
 that drive in Ukraine, you're talking about,

33:14.880 --> 33:19.240
 I mean, really bad conditions of roads.

33:19.240 --> 33:21.240
 And I'm sure in many parts of Africa

33:21.240 --> 33:23.680
 and many parts of the world, the roads are even worse.

33:23.680 --> 33:24.680
 Right, right.

33:24.680 --> 33:28.320
 And outdoor, you know, having an indoor toilet

33:28.320 --> 33:32.400
 is a fascinatingly awesome luxury to have.

33:32.400 --> 33:33.600
 It is, it is.

33:33.600 --> 33:35.400
 And don't take me wrong, Lex.

33:35.400 --> 33:40.400
 Do we have some great roads now in many parts of Africa?

33:41.360 --> 33:44.040
 Yes, main arteries, great roads,

33:44.040 --> 33:45.760
 you're like, whoa, this is moving.

33:46.880 --> 33:48.640
 Yes, we do.

33:48.640 --> 33:52.600
 But definitely more today than in my time growing up.

33:53.960 --> 33:58.120
 Do we have, you know, a country like Nigeria

33:58.120 --> 34:02.200
 that just birthed six unicorns last year alone?

34:02.200 --> 34:03.200
 Yes.

34:03.200 --> 34:06.440
 Do we have the African youth out there

34:06.440 --> 34:10.080
 being so amazing and, you know, living their lives?

34:10.080 --> 34:12.440
 Yes, we have all of that.

34:12.440 --> 34:14.760
 But it is still, unfortunately,

34:14.760 --> 34:18.320
 just like we're scratching the surface.

34:18.320 --> 34:21.360
 And those people still are getting all of that accomplished

34:21.360 --> 34:23.320
 literally swimming through molasses.

34:23.320 --> 34:27.120
 This is some of the most gross,

34:27.120 --> 34:32.120
 immoral, unfair waste of human capital.

34:35.840 --> 34:40.840
 And so that is the, started with you as a seven year old

34:41.360 --> 34:43.320
 asking, wait a minute,

34:43.320 --> 34:48.320
 how do amazing people in Europe do this

34:48.320 --> 34:50.560
 and the amazing people in Africa don't?

34:50.560 --> 34:52.200
 Yeah, and that's a key word, amazing.

34:52.200 --> 34:55.160
 Because that's what I realized later

34:55.160 --> 34:57.520
 because it was not always like that for me,

34:57.520 --> 34:59.160
 amazing and amazing, right?

34:59.160 --> 35:02.720
 I knew instinctively that of course we are amazing too.

35:02.720 --> 35:06.960
 But so eventually the question became how,

35:06.960 --> 35:09.440
 so I went from how come they have this and we don't

35:09.440 --> 35:11.840
 to the country as I'm growing up and researching

35:11.840 --> 35:12.960
 because it stayed with me.

35:12.960 --> 35:14.880
 When I tell you I'm obsessed, I'm haunted.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.000
 I am haunted.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.520
 So you can laugh all you want, but it's,

35:19.680 --> 35:23.080
 so the question became, the question became,

35:23.080 --> 35:27.760
 how come some countries like the United States,

35:27.760 --> 35:32.600
 Singapore are rich and some others like mine

35:32.600 --> 35:35.040
 and many others in Africa are poor?

35:35.040 --> 35:37.000
 That became the question.

35:37.000 --> 35:41.280
 And along the line, like along the road,

35:41.280 --> 35:44.720
 I continued on living my life, wondering about this question.

35:45.840 --> 35:50.400
 And I've heard all types of reasons

35:50.400 --> 35:53.840
 as to supposedly why that might be the case.

35:53.840 --> 35:56.120
 Some people with a very straight face

35:56.120 --> 36:00.360
 are still peddling the IQ fury, according to which,

36:00.360 --> 36:03.000
 come on, darling, it's not your fault.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.520
 You know, your skin color goes with a gene sequence

36:05.520 --> 36:07.840
 that just doesn't allow you to be as smart

36:07.840 --> 36:09.880
 as white people are.

36:09.880 --> 36:12.920
 And it's not your fault, but just accept it.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.320
 That stuff is still out there.

36:14.320 --> 36:15.160
 It's very real.

36:16.040 --> 36:17.800
 I and I have to hear it.

36:17.800 --> 36:21.240
 And others would say to me, oh, it's just because,

36:21.240 --> 36:25.480
 you know, you guys don't have adequate level of education.

36:25.480 --> 36:28.240
 And I say, you know, maybe you gotta go say that

36:29.400 --> 36:33.160
 to most of the street sellers you go see in Senegal.

36:33.160 --> 36:34.520
 You go up to any of these,

36:34.520 --> 36:37.680
 to many of these street sellers in Senegal,

36:37.680 --> 36:41.800
 they are wading through cars and moving cars

36:41.800 --> 36:48.160
 under the hot sun, fumes thrown at their face,

36:48.160 --> 36:51.800
 trying to sell you anything that you think

36:51.800 --> 36:53.400
 you might be able to use.

36:53.400 --> 36:56.920
 Whether we're talking about an ironing board

36:56.920 --> 36:59.800
 to an umbrella, to Q tips,

36:59.800 --> 37:02.880
 to, you know, toothpicks,

37:02.880 --> 37:04.840
 selling you whatever you need from your car,

37:04.840 --> 37:06.400
 these are street sellers.

37:06.400 --> 37:10.800
 And you ask them, dear, do you have any degree?

37:10.800 --> 37:14.520
 Yeah, I have this great degree in math

37:14.520 --> 37:17.560
 or in literature or whatever.

37:17.560 --> 37:20.280
 Some very, very educated people.

37:20.280 --> 37:22.520
 Yet they're right there, this is what they're doing.

37:22.520 --> 37:27.520
 So that's just at scale wasted human potential.

37:28.560 --> 37:29.400
 Thank you.

37:29.400 --> 37:32.440
 So that has to do, the wasted human potential

37:32.440 --> 37:35.000
 has to do now with the system,

37:35.000 --> 37:37.320
 with something about the laws.

37:37.320 --> 37:38.880
 Which is, yeah.

37:38.880 --> 37:43.560
 Something about sort of the things that limit

37:43.560 --> 37:45.680
 or enable the entrepreneur.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.880
 Yes, because at that point I've heard this,

37:48.880 --> 37:50.360
 you know, I heard people say,

37:50.360 --> 37:52.520
 yeah, your IQ is no good.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.440
 Yeah, you don't have enough degrees

37:54.440 --> 37:56.000
 or you're not educated.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.280
 Yeah, some people would even say,

37:57.280 --> 37:58.680
 it's because you guys are malnourished,

37:58.680 --> 38:01.400
 you're malnourished, you need to be fed.

38:01.400 --> 38:03.800
 Others, oh, well, maybe I'll give you some shoes

38:03.800 --> 38:06.000
 and maybe something is gonna change, whatever.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.840
 And then, so I heard all of this nonsense, Lex,

38:08.840 --> 38:09.920
 but you guess what, but guess what?

38:09.920 --> 38:10.760
 None of them made sense.

38:10.760 --> 38:12.040
 You know why it didn't make sense?

38:12.040 --> 38:14.600
 Because if any of that crap was true,

38:14.600 --> 38:19.080
 why, oh, why is it that my parents

38:19.080 --> 38:22.720
 or any other people from these places,

38:22.720 --> 38:23.960
 and oh, and by the way,

38:23.960 --> 38:28.080
 some people call those places God forsaken land.

38:28.080 --> 38:31.480
 That's also the type of cred you always have to hear

38:31.480 --> 38:33.280
 when it's not just flat out,

38:33.280 --> 38:36.360
 SHIT whole countries from, you know,

38:36.360 --> 38:40.240
 one person a few years ago, president of this country.

38:40.240 --> 38:42.520
 That sentiment is sometimes there.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.240
 It is, it is.

38:44.240 --> 38:45.600
 As I go on with my life,

38:45.600 --> 38:48.560
 trying to find the answer to why are some countries

38:48.560 --> 38:50.160
 like mine poor while others are rich,

38:50.160 --> 38:53.000
 I'm hearing all of these reasons thrown at me.

38:53.880 --> 38:57.440
 And then they make no sense because then how come then

38:57.440 --> 39:01.800
 if my parents move as it is usually anyone else

39:01.800 --> 39:04.920
 who moves from a poorer nation

39:04.920 --> 39:07.040
 to a nation that supposedly is rich,

39:07.040 --> 39:11.640
 all of a sudden they get to manifest the greatest potential.

39:12.560 --> 39:14.280
 So I'm starting to think this has nothing to do

39:14.280 --> 39:16.080
 with a person per se,

39:16.080 --> 39:17.600
 because we're talking about the same person,

39:17.600 --> 39:20.960
 same background, same name, features, everything.

39:20.960 --> 39:22.040
 Now I'm starting to think

39:22.040 --> 39:24.160
 maybe it doesn't have to do with a person.

39:24.160 --> 39:26.720
 Maybe we're talking about something that has to do

39:26.720 --> 39:28.400
 with a place that they came from

39:28.400 --> 39:30.160
 or the place that they're going to.

39:30.160 --> 39:33.400
 So this little thing is starting to be in my mind.

39:33.400 --> 39:34.840
 Again, remember, this is not something

39:34.840 --> 39:36.240
 that I woke up to overnight.

39:36.240 --> 39:38.240
 I'm like, voila, I got my question.

39:38.240 --> 39:39.560
 It took me for a long time.

39:39.560 --> 39:42.240
 And I had to face off

39:42.240 --> 39:44.880
 to have many different ideologies face each other.

39:44.880 --> 39:46.360
 I had to really have a reckoning

39:46.360 --> 39:48.720
 literally in my heart and in my mind.

39:50.120 --> 39:53.400
 And so then that's what I'm thinking.

39:53.400 --> 39:57.440
 It cannot be, no, no, no, it's the same people.

39:57.440 --> 39:58.280
 It has to be about the place.

39:58.280 --> 40:00.960
 It has to be about the place, but then what about this place?

40:00.960 --> 40:05.200
 But then even about the place, you're thinking,

40:05.200 --> 40:07.920
 again, two countries, different backgrounds, same outcome,

40:07.920 --> 40:09.600
 same background, different outcome.

40:10.800 --> 40:11.960
 What is this?

40:11.960 --> 40:13.880
 And then I go on.

40:13.880 --> 40:17.520
 I start, I am in Silicon Valley

40:17.520 --> 40:21.720
 in the late 90s, early 2000s,

40:21.720 --> 40:23.720
 that come boom, all of that.

40:23.720 --> 40:26.600
 And I'm starting to discover this concept

40:26.600 --> 40:28.680
 of this thing called entrepreneurship.

40:28.680 --> 40:30.200
 You know, I'm in Silicon Valley

40:30.200 --> 40:34.720
 and just getting to experience what seems so cliche by now,

40:34.720 --> 40:37.000
 but you know, people getting together

40:37.000 --> 40:39.600
 in the back of a napkin, talking about an idea,

40:39.600 --> 40:40.960
 putting it out, and then they go out

40:40.960 --> 40:43.040
 and they talk to some of these investors

40:43.040 --> 40:44.080
 who's gonna invest in it.

40:44.080 --> 40:45.040
 Then they have the lawyers

40:45.040 --> 40:47.320
 who get to put all of this stuff together.

40:47.320 --> 40:49.760
 And then they have the big four CPA firms,

40:49.760 --> 40:52.960
 this whole ecosystem of what they call entrepreneurship.

40:52.960 --> 40:54.920
 And then eventually this concept of entrepreneurship

40:54.920 --> 40:59.320
 being this idea of creating something out of nothing.

40:59.320 --> 41:00.760
 So there I am.

41:00.760 --> 41:03.040
 And at some point I become an entrepreneur myself.

41:03.040 --> 41:04.680
 And the way I became an entrepreneur was not like,

41:04.680 --> 41:06.440
 I woke up and I'm like,

41:06.440 --> 41:09.200
 I wanna make money, so I'm gonna become an entrepreneur.

41:09.200 --> 41:12.080
 No, and this is also another problem I have with people

41:12.080 --> 41:15.120
 who have a problem with entrepreneurs or business people.

41:15.120 --> 41:19.840
 Most entrepreneurs do not start a business to become rich.

41:19.840 --> 41:22.640
 Most entrepreneurs start a business

41:22.640 --> 41:25.040
 because they have found, identified a problem

41:25.040 --> 41:26.720
 that bothered them enough,

41:26.720 --> 41:28.920
 that they said, enough is enough.

41:28.920 --> 41:30.480
 I'm gonna do something about it.

41:30.480 --> 41:34.600
 What entrepreneurs are are people who criticize by creating.

41:34.600 --> 41:35.880
 Do they always get it right?

41:35.880 --> 41:37.400
 No, as a matter of fact,

41:37.400 --> 41:40.440
 the failure in entrepreneurship is humongous.

41:40.440 --> 41:45.440
 It's kamikaze path to take the entrepreneurship path.

41:45.520 --> 41:46.920
 We lose our spouses.

41:46.920 --> 41:48.760
 My first husband passed away

41:48.760 --> 41:51.960
 as soon as I was about to sign my first term sheet.

41:51.960 --> 41:54.640
 And yet I had to keep going.

41:54.640 --> 41:57.400
 What force can keep you going

41:57.400 --> 41:59.920
 after you just lost the love of your life?

41:59.920 --> 42:01.680
 What force keeps you going?

42:01.680 --> 42:04.640
 The force of, oh, I just wanna be rich, really?

42:04.640 --> 42:07.120
 When your whole world is upside down,

42:08.560 --> 42:12.280
 your whole world is upside down and you just want to quit.

42:12.280 --> 42:15.360
 You just want to go meet him and join him in death.

42:16.320 --> 42:17.400
 I stayed, why?

42:17.400 --> 42:20.720
 Because of the same reason why I started my company.

42:20.720 --> 42:22.920
 I stayed because of the women

42:22.920 --> 42:25.800
 whom I had put back to work by then.

42:25.800 --> 42:27.680
 We're talking about some of the most vulnerable women

42:27.680 --> 42:28.960
 in my country.

42:28.960 --> 42:31.200
 These are women who grow the hibiscus,

42:31.200 --> 42:33.120
 which we need to make the bisap,

42:33.120 --> 42:35.240
 which is the juice of taranga, remember?

42:35.240 --> 42:37.840
 This is our national identity drink.

42:37.840 --> 42:40.200
 And for the longest time, women grow this hibiscus

42:40.200 --> 42:43.160
 that we use for the national drink, for this drink.

42:43.160 --> 42:45.400
 And now that Coca Cola, Pepsi, and all that

42:45.400 --> 42:46.880
 had made it through the marketing

42:46.880 --> 42:49.560
 that it is more cool to drink those beverages,

42:49.560 --> 42:52.240
 now there is no more market for the hibiscus.

42:52.240 --> 42:54.760
 And with that goes the livelihoods of these women.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.480
 And for me, that bothered me enough

42:58.480 --> 43:00.760
 because in that force, I saw two things.

43:00.760 --> 43:03.680
 One was a part of my culture.

43:03.680 --> 43:06.080
 We're talking about, I mean,

43:06.080 --> 43:10.120
 part of my cultural identity, for Christ's sake,

43:10.120 --> 43:11.280
 the juice of taranga.

43:11.280 --> 43:12.560
 You asked me, what defines you?

43:12.560 --> 43:14.880
 I said, taranga, there's a juice for it.

43:14.880 --> 43:16.760
 So my culture is disappearing.

43:16.760 --> 43:19.600
 And at the same time, these women

43:20.680 --> 43:22.880
 are sliding into abject poverty

43:22.880 --> 43:25.880
 because what they used to make no one needs anymore.

43:25.880 --> 43:30.880
 So that is what got me to start a company.

43:31.040 --> 43:34.000
 And the company was created just because of that.

43:34.000 --> 43:38.640
 I wanted to build a company that would allow me

43:38.640 --> 43:42.600
 to not only preserve this very important aspect

43:42.600 --> 43:44.160
 of my cultural identity,

43:44.160 --> 43:48.440
 and at the same time, put these women back to work.

43:48.440 --> 43:51.440
 And maybe it's more difficult to put into words,

43:51.440 --> 43:55.840
 but there's a kind of, it's a basic human spirit

43:55.840 --> 43:58.880
 where you see the place where you came from

44:00.480 --> 44:03.120
 breaking apart in some kind of way,

44:03.120 --> 44:06.480
 and you have the entrepreneurial fire

44:06.480 --> 44:08.640
 that dreams of helping.

44:08.640 --> 44:09.480
 Yes.

44:09.480 --> 44:13.480
 And that, sometimes it's hard to convert that into words.

44:13.480 --> 44:15.120
 You have to tell nice stories and so on,

44:15.120 --> 44:17.360
 but it's the basic human desire to help.

44:17.360 --> 44:18.200
 Yes.

44:18.200 --> 44:21.320
 And like I said, criticized by creating.

44:21.320 --> 44:22.920
 Especially when you've been,

44:22.920 --> 44:25.200
 especially when, and let's face it,

44:26.560 --> 44:29.760
 do we all, are we all a bundle of circumstances,

44:29.760 --> 44:31.480
 some happy, some worse?

44:31.480 --> 44:32.640
 Yes, we are.

44:32.640 --> 44:37.120
 And oftentimes I ask myself, my God, why you?

44:37.120 --> 44:42.120
 Why did you get to have the opportunities that you have?

44:42.120 --> 44:44.200
 What makes you different from, let's say,

44:44.200 --> 44:49.200
 even your cousin that couldn't, that is still home, trapped?

44:49.200 --> 44:51.640
 Because we call ourselves trapped citizens.

44:51.640 --> 44:54.520
 When you're trapped in these countries that go nowhere,

44:54.520 --> 44:57.240
 we're like a bunch of trapped citizens.

44:57.240 --> 45:02.240
 So you see, Lex, when my husband passed away

45:02.440 --> 45:04.840
 and I wanted nothing more to do than to quit

45:04.840 --> 45:07.440
 and to send, investors had already said,

45:07.440 --> 45:09.200
 we understand if you want to stop.

45:09.200 --> 45:11.440
 Whatever you decide to do, we'll do that.

45:11.440 --> 45:15.360
 And I wanted to quit and I was actually on my way.

45:15.360 --> 45:17.920
 I was in Senegal for a month,

45:17.920 --> 45:20.520
 trying to really get a bearing over myself.

45:20.520 --> 45:25.520
 And by the end of the month, I had decided I'm letting go.

45:25.720 --> 45:26.560
 There's no way.

45:26.560 --> 45:30.200
 The pain was too great, nothing made sense anymore.

45:30.200 --> 45:31.760
 It was too much.

45:31.760 --> 45:36.760
 So I went to see this woman and I talked to the one who,

45:36.920 --> 45:39.160
 you know, we're talking back then,

45:39.160 --> 45:43.520
 there were 400 of them, later on we grew to 9,000.

45:43.520 --> 45:47.800
 And I told the representative of all of them,

45:47.800 --> 45:51.160
 and I told her, this is very, this is her old lady.

45:51.160 --> 45:53.320
 And just looking at her,

45:53.320 --> 45:54.920
 I knew I was going through some pain,

45:54.920 --> 45:57.600
 but this woman has probably gone through 10 times,

45:57.600 --> 46:00.320
 not that pain is, you know, like measurable,

46:00.320 --> 46:02.880
 but you could tell this woman probably lost a child

46:02.880 --> 46:05.240
 as oftentimes happen in places, you know,

46:05.240 --> 46:07.880
 that are lower income countries.

46:07.880 --> 46:11.600
 Probably lost a husband also, probably who knows,

46:11.600 --> 46:13.560
 so many people, loss is part of our lives.

46:13.560 --> 46:14.400
 You can see the pain.

46:14.400 --> 46:18.080
 You can see the pain, yet she's so, so dignified.

46:18.080 --> 46:19.840
 She's so dignified.

46:19.840 --> 46:22.120
 And that already kind of made me like,

46:22.120 --> 46:23.520
 my God, stop crying.

46:23.520 --> 46:27.040
 But, and I told her that I was quitting.

46:28.080 --> 46:29.560
 I could not look her in the eyes.

46:29.560 --> 46:33.720
 And she said, look at me.

46:33.720 --> 46:34.880
 I could not look her in the eyes.

46:34.880 --> 46:36.280
 She said, look at me, child.

46:36.280 --> 46:40.520
 And I looked at her and she said,

46:41.560 --> 46:44.840
 you know, I know you're in pain,

46:44.840 --> 46:48.240
 but where your husband is, where your beloved is,

46:48.240 --> 46:51.200
 is absolutely nothing that you can do for him.

46:51.200 --> 46:54.080
 But for us, you can change everything.

46:54.080 --> 46:55.800
 And I went back.

46:55.800 --> 47:00.800
 So that's what entrepreneurs are at their best.

47:01.320 --> 47:03.200
 Did she help you find your strength?

47:03.200 --> 47:08.200
 Yes, and I was weak still,

47:08.280 --> 47:11.040
 but I said, you put that aside.

47:11.040 --> 47:12.320
 There's a job to do here.

47:13.240 --> 47:16.920
 And I went back and I fought with everything that I had.

47:16.920 --> 47:19.120
 And this company that I started in my kitchen

47:20.480 --> 47:22.520
 became this company that had the who's who

47:22.520 --> 47:23.720
 of the beverage world,

47:24.800 --> 47:27.680
 with at some point, Roger Enrico, the chairman of PepsiCo

47:27.680 --> 47:30.360
 sitting on my board.

47:30.360 --> 47:34.400
 And yeah, I went back because of that.

47:34.400 --> 47:37.680
 So the reason why I tell this story for me is important

47:37.680 --> 47:40.360
 because the world needs to understand

47:43.120 --> 47:48.120
 that there is a viable way of caring

47:50.040 --> 47:53.640
 and of being part of a solution

47:54.560 --> 47:57.320
 for the lesser fortunate

47:57.320 --> 48:00.480
 in terms of not keeping them where they are

48:00.480 --> 48:02.240
 and we're like the saviors coming

48:02.240 --> 48:03.880
 and giving them food and all that.

48:03.880 --> 48:05.000
 No, no, no, no, no.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.760
 But it's just like the leg up I got in my life.

48:07.760 --> 48:09.160
 Give somebody else a leg up.

48:10.640 --> 48:14.000
 What are the things you're fighting against in Africa

48:14.000 --> 48:17.360
 when you try to build a business like that?

48:17.360 --> 48:19.200
 So then we're building this company.

48:20.200 --> 48:24.760
 And back then, this was in 2004

48:24.760 --> 48:28.720
 that was when I built my first company.

48:28.720 --> 48:32.280
 We had to have two sister companies, one there, one here.

48:32.280 --> 48:35.840
 So the one in Africa was about the whole supply chain.

48:36.920 --> 48:41.920
 And the one in America was research and development,

48:42.320 --> 48:44.520
 sales and marketing, all of that good stuff.

48:45.680 --> 48:48.440
 And then at some point I look around,

48:48.440 --> 48:50.120
 I'm like, wait a second.

48:50.120 --> 48:52.680
 Here, back in the days before we had the,

48:52.680 --> 48:55.080
 they would talk, they would say, oh, we have this one stop shop

48:55.080 --> 48:56.440
 for business registration.

48:56.440 --> 49:00.120
 But the truth is very quickly

49:00.120 --> 49:01.760
 you can set up an LLC in the US.

49:01.760 --> 49:05.000
 We're talking about less than, even then less than,

49:05.000 --> 49:07.840
 today it's super fast, 20 minutes online, done.

49:07.840 --> 49:12.760
 Back then it was less than few hours to get it done,

49:13.600 --> 49:14.680
 cost you almost nothing.

49:14.680 --> 49:16.560
 We're talking about a few hundred dollars,

49:16.560 --> 49:19.360
 three, two to 350 depending which state you are.

49:19.360 --> 49:23.800
 So LLC, starting a basic company takes almost no time.

49:23.800 --> 49:25.680
 No time, no time, no money, almost.

49:25.680 --> 49:29.120
 You don't have to know a guy that knows a guy

49:29.120 --> 49:33.240
 that slipped some money to the politician and so on.

49:33.240 --> 49:35.560
 No, none of that stuff, none of that stuff.

49:35.560 --> 49:39.960
 And so at the same time, also things like,

49:39.960 --> 49:42.600
 and this I can take you even to today's day.

49:42.600 --> 49:44.760
 Okay, Lex, I don't know if you have employees

49:44.760 --> 49:46.600
 on payroll or anything like that,

49:46.600 --> 49:50.560
 but do you have to go every month

49:50.560 --> 49:52.760
 or anybody listening to us right now,

49:52.760 --> 49:56.840
 do they have to go every single month

49:56.840 --> 49:59.000
 to three different type of agencies,

50:02.040 --> 50:07.040
 like governmental agencies to do one step?

50:07.440 --> 50:10.160
 This one is basically you're gonna go

50:10.160 --> 50:14.000
 and give them your retirement money,

50:14.000 --> 50:16.240
 like the pension part of the salary

50:16.240 --> 50:18.400
 that you took out from your employee.

50:18.400 --> 50:20.080
 You have to go to this agency

50:20.080 --> 50:22.040
 and put that application through.

50:22.040 --> 50:23.840
 So you leave that money behind,

50:23.840 --> 50:25.360
 then you go to another agency.

50:25.360 --> 50:28.360
 This one is for the health, care, whatever.

50:28.360 --> 50:30.000
 You have three of those places

50:30.000 --> 50:33.560
 where you have to literally go to in person,

50:33.560 --> 50:36.800
 three times, three places every single month

50:37.680 --> 50:40.080
 to drop off these paperwork.

50:41.320 --> 50:42.600
 Do you have to do that anywhere in the US?

50:42.600 --> 50:45.080
 I mean, do we have that situation

50:45.080 --> 50:47.120
 anywhere that you know of right now?

50:47.120 --> 50:48.200
 No, no.

50:48.200 --> 50:50.120
 And do you think that's a business friendly

50:50.120 --> 50:52.160
 or do you think it's cumbersome in business?

50:52.160 --> 50:55.160
 And that's not just cumbersome sort of physically,

50:55.160 --> 50:57.320
 it's cumbersome psychologically,

50:57.320 --> 51:01.880
 that there's a feeling like the system around you,

51:01.880 --> 51:03.760
 yeah, there's a feeling like you're trapped.

51:03.760 --> 51:07.200
 It's a feeling like the system doesn't want you to succeed

51:07.200 --> 51:09.520
 versus a system that does want you to succeed.

51:09.520 --> 51:10.840
 Exactly.

51:10.840 --> 51:13.880
 You're in a country like we're in Texas.

51:13.880 --> 51:18.040
 If you make less than a million bucks in revenues a year,

51:18.040 --> 51:19.800
 all you do, five minutes it takes you,

51:19.800 --> 51:24.800
 you're filing your franchise tax, that's it.

51:27.080 --> 51:29.280
 It's below that number, tell them what it is,

51:29.280 --> 51:30.720
 then you have nothing to give them

51:30.720 --> 51:33.160
 or anything like that, you move on.

51:33.160 --> 51:36.880
 Us, even if I make this much,

51:38.040 --> 51:40.120
 there is a minimum tax that you have to pay,

51:40.120 --> 51:42.560
 which is $1,000 in Senegal right now.

51:42.560 --> 51:46.480
 For the listener, my guy was holding up a zero.

51:47.560 --> 51:49.040
 You make no money.

51:49.040 --> 51:49.880
 You still have to pay.

51:49.880 --> 51:52.720
 You still have to pay.

51:52.720 --> 51:55.560
 And then, oh, let me walk you through what happened to me

51:55.560 --> 51:59.120
 when we had to try to get the electricity hooked up

51:59.120 --> 52:00.800
 on our first office.

52:00.800 --> 52:03.320
 So we go, they say, oh, first you have to apply,

52:03.320 --> 52:05.800
 you know, like you normally you have to apply.

52:05.800 --> 52:08.280
 Then we apply, we pay the money.

52:08.280 --> 52:10.040
 Remember again, here you have to also go,

52:10.040 --> 52:13.320
 this was like, you know, you go to the office and you pay.

52:13.320 --> 52:16.520
 And then we wait, and we wait, and we wait.

52:16.520 --> 52:17.840
 And when I say we wait, I'm not talking about

52:17.840 --> 52:20.400
 we waited 24 hours, we waited 48 hours.

52:20.400 --> 52:24.200
 A month, two months, three months, four months,

52:24.200 --> 52:26.960
 five months, you go, you send your assistant,

52:26.960 --> 52:28.760
 she goes, she comes back.

52:28.760 --> 52:30.160
 Well, they say we send it to wait.

52:30.160 --> 52:31.800
 At some point I'm like, I gotta go there.

52:31.800 --> 52:34.520
 So I go there and I asked to speak

52:34.520 --> 52:38.240
 to the head of the district for, you know,

52:38.240 --> 52:41.920
 and I'm just like going on and on and on and on

52:41.920 --> 52:43.240
 about how we've been delayed.

52:43.240 --> 52:44.280
 This is gonna be a problem.

52:44.280 --> 52:46.560
 We have to produce, everything is delayed.

52:46.560 --> 52:49.080
 And I risk losing my business.

52:49.080 --> 52:53.000
 We already presold some of these products to our customers.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.800
 I gotta, something needs to happen.

52:55.880 --> 52:58.000
 So at some point the gentleman looks at me,

52:58.000 --> 52:59.520
 he's like, lady, look over there.

52:59.520 --> 53:03.880
 I look over there, I see a pile of paper this high.

53:03.880 --> 53:07.240
 We're talking about maybe hundreds of applications.

53:07.240 --> 53:10.240
 Each one of them is a single sheet.

53:10.240 --> 53:12.280
 Each single sheet is an application

53:12.280 --> 53:14.760
 for getting the electricity.

53:15.600 --> 53:16.920
 And he says, do you see that?

53:16.920 --> 53:17.760
 I said, yeah.

53:17.760 --> 53:18.720
 And he said, look over there.

53:18.720 --> 53:20.680
 I look over there to the other side.

53:20.680 --> 53:22.400
 I see two meters.

53:22.400 --> 53:26.280
 He's like, each of these applications needs one of those.

53:26.280 --> 53:27.120
 How many do you see?

53:27.120 --> 53:28.160
 I said, two.

53:28.160 --> 53:29.600
 Then I knew I was in trouble.

53:31.320 --> 53:33.680
 And then I said, what do I do?

53:33.680 --> 53:37.480
 And he said, lady, it's not at our level.

53:37.480 --> 53:38.480
 And I agreed with him.

53:38.480 --> 53:40.040
 It was not on his level.

53:40.040 --> 53:41.880
 But eventually, by now you can tell

53:41.880 --> 53:44.120
 that I pretty much get what I need because,

53:44.120 --> 53:46.000
 and at that point what I did was not threaten him

53:46.000 --> 53:46.840
 or anything like that.

53:46.840 --> 53:47.840
 I didn't even pay a bribe or anything,

53:47.840 --> 53:50.160
 but you could see why people pay bribes.

53:50.160 --> 53:52.080
 Because when you have a pile like that,

53:52.080 --> 53:53.960
 then the only way to advance your file,

53:53.960 --> 53:56.920
 and that by the way happens even at the passport office.

53:56.920 --> 54:00.720
 You come, you apply for your passport, which is your right.

54:00.720 --> 54:02.000
 They forced us to have passports.

54:02.000 --> 54:03.880
 It's your right as a citizen to have a passport.

54:03.880 --> 54:06.280
 And even there, if you want yours

54:06.280 --> 54:07.480
 to keep going through the process,

54:07.480 --> 54:09.120
 you have to bribe somebody so it can go

54:09.120 --> 54:11.880
 even the pace it's supposed to go, let alone faster.

54:11.880 --> 54:15.160
 So here, I'm thinking I have a problem.

54:15.160 --> 54:17.360
 And at that point, I did what I do.

54:17.360 --> 54:19.760
 I talked to him about all the things I was trying to do.

54:19.760 --> 54:22.960
 I explained to him why I'm here, why I'm trying to do this.

54:22.960 --> 54:25.320
 And even him said, lady, someone like you,

54:25.320 --> 54:28.360
 you have no reason to even be here.

54:28.360 --> 54:30.960
 You could be back in America, living your life,

54:30.960 --> 54:32.640
 la vida loca, you don't have to be here.

54:32.640 --> 54:35.240
 So that I think gained a lot of his respect.

54:35.240 --> 54:38.320
 And I said, if you don't do, if you don't help me with this,

54:38.320 --> 54:40.920
 I understand I shouldn't be of a priority

54:40.920 --> 54:43.600
 or anything like that, but I beg you, I beg of you.

54:43.600 --> 54:46.440
 I need for this to go on this week.

54:46.440 --> 54:48.680
 And he said, okay, that's how I got my meter.

54:48.680 --> 54:50.640
 One of those two meters became mine.

54:50.640 --> 54:52.520
 So then he said, but we have a problem.

54:52.520 --> 54:53.920
 And I said, what?

54:53.920 --> 54:57.720
 He said, well, the truck, we need a truck to be here

54:57.720 --> 55:00.880
 to do it because of where you are from the poll,

55:00.880 --> 55:05.360
 we need long cable lines to get it all done.

55:05.360 --> 55:06.760
 But the truck is, I don't know,

55:06.760 --> 55:07.800
 I don't know where the truck was

55:07.800 --> 55:08.680
 because they had this one truck

55:08.680 --> 55:10.640
 for I don't know how many customers.

55:10.640 --> 55:11.920
 So I go to the mayor of a town

55:11.920 --> 55:15.920
 with whom I'm quite friends, but you see, I know people,

55:15.920 --> 55:17.360
 but it shouldn't be this way.

55:17.360 --> 55:21.240
 So I go to the mayor of a town and I said, mayor,

55:21.240 --> 55:22.760
 he happens to have the same name as me,

55:22.760 --> 55:25.520
 first, last name, same, but except he's the ugly one,

55:25.520 --> 55:28.600
 I'm the pretty one because, you know, he's, you know.

55:28.600 --> 55:32.400
 That's so people can tell you apart, she's the pretty one.

55:32.400 --> 55:34.920
 Exactly, I'm the pretty one and he's the whatever.

55:34.920 --> 55:37.360
 So I got to the mayor and I'm like, mayor,

55:37.360 --> 55:38.960
 I need your help, you need to help me with this.

55:38.960 --> 55:40.320
 He's like, now what?

55:40.320 --> 55:42.120
 And I explained to him and he's like, okay,

55:42.120 --> 55:45.280
 you can take the truck from the city hall.

55:45.280 --> 55:47.640
 I'll tell the guys that they can allow you to have it.

55:47.640 --> 55:50.200
 And then they come and then you guys can do this.

55:50.200 --> 55:51.560
 And then we arrived there.

55:51.560 --> 55:52.400
 Guess what?

55:52.400 --> 55:54.720
 I thought I was done, Lex, but I was not done.

55:54.720 --> 55:56.680
 Because now the electricity company, by the way,

55:56.680 --> 55:59.000
 whom we paid, everything was there.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.360
 They've been sitting on our money for nine months by now.

56:02.360 --> 56:06.440
 Well, we need a ladder long enough to, you know,

56:06.440 --> 56:08.160
 like one of the super, super professional ladders

56:08.160 --> 56:10.960
 that normally the electricity companies have.

56:10.960 --> 56:15.040
 Theirs was in some other village and they didn't know

56:15.040 --> 56:16.720
 if it was going to be back for another three days

56:16.720 --> 56:17.560
 or four days.

56:18.640 --> 56:20.520
 I said, are you kidding me?

56:20.520 --> 56:21.760
 He's like, no.

56:21.760 --> 56:23.080
 So I call mayor again.

56:23.080 --> 56:25.240
 I'm just like, mayor, do you have a ladder?

56:25.240 --> 56:26.680
 And I explained and he said,

56:26.680 --> 56:30.640
 and that's how I got my electricity hooked up.

56:30.640 --> 56:33.240
 Otherwise I probably would still be waiting.

56:33.240 --> 56:36.240
 So Lex, you add all of these things together.

56:36.240 --> 56:38.360
 And also the fact that in my country, by the way,

56:38.360 --> 56:41.200
 the labor laws are so stringent.

56:41.200 --> 56:44.240
 Basically you are married to employees for good or for bad.

56:44.240 --> 56:45.960
 And some people say, oh no,

56:45.960 --> 56:47.560
 you're not married for good or for bad,

56:47.560 --> 56:50.520
 except that it will just cost you a lot of time and money

56:50.520 --> 56:52.520
 to get rid of any of them.

56:52.520 --> 56:54.080
 It doesn't matter the circumstances.

56:54.080 --> 56:56.080
 Do you think I really, an entrepreneur really need

56:56.080 --> 56:57.520
 to hear something like that?

56:57.520 --> 56:58.760
 You know, the head of the ILO,

56:58.760 --> 57:01.240
 I had an argument with him at the UN.

57:01.240 --> 57:04.680
 And I said to him, listen, and you listened to me very well.

57:04.680 --> 57:09.680
 The reason, if you want to protect employees,

57:10.320 --> 57:13.800
 as you claim, everything you're doing is to protect employees.

57:13.800 --> 57:17.240
 A, you know better of a human being than I am

57:17.240 --> 57:18.720
 in terms of wanting to make sure

57:18.720 --> 57:21.160
 that people are treated right and fairly.

57:21.160 --> 57:24.880
 But last time I checked, Google, for example,

57:24.880 --> 57:28.320
 is not offering their employees chef cooked meals,

57:28.320 --> 57:31.440
 super healthy, anything they want,

57:31.440 --> 57:34.200
 feeding them from morning till evening,

57:34.200 --> 57:39.200
 having some babysitters, having childcare on site,

57:39.440 --> 57:44.360
 all of these perks that come on top of really cozy salaries.

57:44.360 --> 57:46.600
 It did not happen because you, the ILO, told them,

57:46.600 --> 57:47.920
 you have to do this.

57:47.920 --> 57:51.640
 It happened because there are enough jobs created around

57:51.640 --> 57:54.960
 that now you're in an employee's market

57:54.960 --> 57:57.760
 and employers have to fall all over themselves

57:57.760 --> 58:00.680
 to attract the best talent among us.

58:00.680 --> 58:01.800
 That's how it's done.

58:01.800 --> 58:05.320
 And not with your nonsense that you're imposing me right now,

58:05.320 --> 58:07.240
 which the only results you're gonna get,

58:07.240 --> 58:09.640
 like in my country, do you know what we have to show

58:09.640 --> 58:12.440
 for all of these, the fact that the Senegalese employees,

58:12.440 --> 58:15.560
 the most protected employee on paper in the world?

58:15.560 --> 58:19.200
 Well, we're one of the 25 poorest countries in the world.

58:19.200 --> 58:20.560
 That's what it got us.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.520
 So let's try to just untangle this.

58:26.520 --> 58:28.360
 So there's a system in place.

58:28.360 --> 58:30.720
 There's a momentum with that system.

58:30.720 --> 58:33.560
 Like you said, ladies, it's not my level,

58:33.560 --> 58:37.040
 which is for somebody who grew up in the Soviet Union,

58:38.240 --> 58:42.120
 at least echoes some of the same sounds I heard

58:42.120 --> 58:45.720
 from people I knew there.

58:45.720 --> 58:48.040
 It's kind of this helpless feeling like,

58:48.040 --> 58:50.200
 well, this is just part of the system,

58:50.200 --> 58:52.520
 this gigantic bureaucracy.

58:52.520 --> 58:56.720
 And the corruption that happens is just like the only way

58:56.720 --> 58:58.920
 to get around, to get anything done.

58:58.920 --> 59:01.240
 And so the corruption grows.

59:01.240 --> 59:03.160
 Maybe could you speak to the corruption?

59:03.160 --> 59:06.920
 Is there, to what degree is there corruption

59:06.920 --> 59:11.920
 in Senegal and Africa, and how do we fix it?

59:13.040 --> 59:16.000
 So when you said to which degrees there is corruption,

59:16.000 --> 59:18.240
 I will respond to you the same I respond to people.

59:18.240 --> 59:19.880
 I say, yeah, we have corruption,

59:19.880 --> 59:23.320
 and it's almost as bad as in Chicago, right?

59:23.320 --> 59:27.000
 So now what I want people to understand

59:27.000 --> 59:28.800
 when it comes to corruption,

59:28.800 --> 59:33.200
 it's because we are misguided with corruption.

59:33.200 --> 59:35.640
 We think corruption is the root cause of problems.

59:35.640 --> 59:38.400
 When corruption is simply a symptom

59:38.400 --> 59:41.040
 of the deeper root problem.

59:42.200 --> 59:47.200
 In this case, if you make the laws so senseless,

59:52.200 --> 59:55.960
 meaning, let me give you an example of senseless laws.

59:55.960 --> 59:59.080
 Every time I have to import something in my country,

59:59.080 --> 1:00:02.280
 I have a business, we're making lip balms in this case

1:00:02.280 --> 1:00:06.440
 and all those skincare products.

1:00:06.440 --> 1:00:09.080
 Some ingredients I'm able to find in the country

1:00:09.080 --> 1:00:13.440
 at the standard that I need in order to remain competitive.

1:00:13.440 --> 1:00:14.920
 Because for example, our products are sold

1:00:14.920 --> 1:00:16.040
 at Whole Foods Market.

1:00:16.040 --> 1:00:18.440
 You can understand it's a pretty sophisticated

1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:22.520
 and really, they don't just put anybody on the shelves.

1:00:22.520 --> 1:00:25.960
 But the thing is, it means that on the other end,

1:00:25.960 --> 1:00:28.960
 my inputs has to be right.

1:00:28.960 --> 1:00:32.920
 So out of those, some, we have seven ingredients,

1:00:32.920 --> 1:00:35.320
 seven items that need to come from abroad

1:00:36.440 --> 1:00:38.560
 to go into the making of this product.

1:00:38.560 --> 1:00:40.960
 Some packaging and some raw material.

1:00:42.200 --> 1:00:45.960
 But guess what, Lex, for five of them,

1:00:45.960 --> 1:00:48.760
 I am paying a 40% tariff

1:00:48.760 --> 1:00:51.440
 and for the other two, almost 70% tariff.

1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:54.800
 That I call senseless laws.

1:00:54.800 --> 1:00:57.920
 These tariffs are senseless.

1:00:57.920 --> 1:00:59.960
 Yeah, corruption is just a symptom.

1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:02.960
 They reveal that something was broken about the laws.

1:01:02.960 --> 1:01:05.960
 And the laws are, so taxation,

1:01:08.040 --> 1:01:10.720
 this kind of restricting laws,

1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:14.520
 like laws that slow down the entrepreneurial momentum.

1:01:14.520 --> 1:01:15.960
 They do, they do.

1:01:15.960 --> 1:01:19.240
 Because in this case, when my product comes,

1:01:19.240 --> 1:01:21.600
 what do people have to do?

1:01:21.600 --> 1:01:25.400
 Because every time, if you add 40%,

1:01:25.400 --> 1:01:26.680
 you're basically on the other end.

1:01:26.680 --> 1:01:28.400
 So every time you add,

1:01:28.400 --> 1:01:31.640
 if let's say my product normally costs a dollar

1:01:31.640 --> 1:01:33.880
 and with your 40%, by the time I'm done,

1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:36.640
 I had to pay, now it's costing me 140.

1:01:36.640 --> 1:01:39.000
 By the time it arrives in my warehouse,

1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:42.520
 in my manufacturing facility, it's now at 140

1:01:42.520 --> 1:01:44.800
 because of a tariff I left behind.

1:01:44.800 --> 1:01:47.200
 That 40% you added to it,

1:01:47.200 --> 1:01:49.960
 do you know how much it's gonna add to my final cost

1:01:49.960 --> 1:01:51.160
 that once the product is finished,

1:01:51.160 --> 1:01:53.160
 I have to sell it to the customer?

1:01:53.160 --> 1:01:57.240
 I have to sell it for $1.60 more because of that 40 cents

1:01:57.240 --> 1:01:58.920
 extra you took from me.

1:01:58.920 --> 1:02:00.880
 In order for me at the end of the day

1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:02.520
 to have some type of profits,

1:02:02.520 --> 1:02:05.920
 because profits at the end of the day

1:02:05.920 --> 1:02:08.280
 is the blood of a business.

1:02:08.280 --> 1:02:09.960
 There are two people are misguided.

1:02:09.960 --> 1:02:13.800
 They say, oh, you dirty, greedy business people.

1:02:13.800 --> 1:02:16.320
 And it's all about profit, profit, profit, profit.

1:02:17.840 --> 1:02:20.560
 You know, I belong to this organization called,

1:02:20.560 --> 1:02:23.080
 I'm a board member on the conscious capitalism.

1:02:23.080 --> 1:02:27.760
 It is the largest organization of purpose driven

1:02:27.760 --> 1:02:29.760
 businesses and entrepreneurs.

1:02:29.760 --> 1:02:31.080
 The type of people I told you about,

1:02:31.080 --> 1:02:34.160
 we've started our businesses because we see something

1:02:34.160 --> 1:02:36.640
 that needs to be taken care of in society.

1:02:36.640 --> 1:02:38.600
 Whole Foods Market is one of them.

1:02:38.600 --> 1:02:40.600
 The Container Store, you know,

1:02:40.600 --> 1:02:43.080
 all of these companies that are beloved in the US

1:02:43.080 --> 1:02:44.800
 that you can hear of.

1:02:44.800 --> 1:02:49.800
 We believe that the end goal of business is purpose.

1:02:49.800 --> 1:02:52.120
 But in order to do purpose,

1:02:52.120 --> 1:02:57.120
 you have to have profits to stay alive.

1:02:57.280 --> 1:02:59.840
 And the best way for people to think of profits

1:02:59.840 --> 1:03:02.560
 so that they're not all twisted about it.

1:03:02.560 --> 1:03:07.040
 Lex, if I asked you, what's your goal in the world?

1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:09.520
 You're probably gonna tell me your dream.

1:03:09.520 --> 1:03:11.880
 You're gonna talk to me about what you're doing right now

1:03:11.880 --> 1:03:13.840
 and how you want to be uniting,

1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:15.240
 or you want a more harmonious world.

1:03:15.240 --> 1:03:16.920
 You want human flourishing.

1:03:16.920 --> 1:03:18.720
 That's what you're working towards.

1:03:18.720 --> 1:03:20.080
 That's what you say to me.

1:03:20.080 --> 1:03:23.040
 You're not gonna say, well, my biggest goal in the world

1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:25.720
 is to produce as many red blood cells as I can.

1:03:25.720 --> 1:03:28.840
 Except you need to produce those, otherwise no Lex.

1:03:28.840 --> 1:03:31.960
 And if no Lex, no one working.

1:03:31.960 --> 1:03:32.800
 Yeah.

1:03:32.800 --> 1:03:33.640
 You know what I mean?

1:03:33.640 --> 1:03:34.480
 Yeah.

1:03:34.480 --> 1:03:35.800
 So that's how people need to stop

1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:37.800
 with this whole profit, non profit.

1:03:37.800 --> 1:03:40.400
 Do we have some psychopaths among us?

1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:42.720
 Yeah, one person of us in this world are psychopaths

1:03:42.720 --> 1:03:45.200
 in every field, anywhere you look.

1:03:45.200 --> 1:03:48.480
 And surely you'll find that in the entrepreneurial field.

1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:50.080
 Entrepreneurs world as well.

1:03:50.080 --> 1:03:50.920
 Yeah.

1:03:50.920 --> 1:03:53.800
 So we have one person of us who are psychopath for sure.

1:03:53.800 --> 1:03:55.240
 But do they define the rest of us?

1:03:55.240 --> 1:03:56.080
 Absolutely not.

1:03:56.080 --> 1:03:57.320
 And thankfully not.

1:03:57.320 --> 1:03:59.920
 So let's just be clear on that.

1:03:59.920 --> 1:04:04.120
 So here, you know, you charge me 40% tariff,

1:04:04.120 --> 1:04:05.880
 which is outrageous.

1:04:05.880 --> 1:04:09.080
 Then you're forcing me to sell it for $1.60 more

1:04:09.080 --> 1:04:10.800
 than my competitor who does not have to go

1:04:10.800 --> 1:04:12.920
 through that nonsense because she's an American woman

1:04:12.920 --> 1:04:14.080
 who is operating in America.

1:04:14.080 --> 1:04:16.200
 And she doesn't have that nonsense put on her.

1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:18.720
 So now I'm on this market competing against this woman

1:04:18.720 --> 1:04:20.320
 eye to eye.

1:04:20.320 --> 1:04:23.640
 So if we're selling the same value product,

1:04:23.640 --> 1:04:27.000
 mine costs $1.60 more simply because of some stupid rules

1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.680
 from back home, then guess who is going to stay in business

1:04:29.680 --> 1:04:30.520
 and who doesn't?

1:04:31.480 --> 1:04:33.680
 See, they want to talk about equality.

1:04:33.680 --> 1:04:35.680
 That's the type of equality I want to see.

1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:39.120
 The playing field has to be leveled.

1:04:39.120 --> 1:04:41.240
 Told you English is my fourth language.

1:04:41.240 --> 1:04:44.520
 It was two people talking between us.

1:04:44.520 --> 1:04:46.480
 Maybe we'll have this English thing figured out.

1:04:46.480 --> 1:04:48.360
 We'll have it figured out.

1:04:48.360 --> 1:04:50.680
 So the idea of capitalism,

1:04:50.680 --> 1:04:53.520
 the idea of conscious capitalism is the thing

1:04:53.520 --> 1:04:57.840
 that in large part enables this level playing field.

1:04:57.840 --> 1:04:58.920
 That's what we want.

1:04:58.920 --> 1:05:01.080
 So what you're trying to say, so here,

1:05:01.080 --> 1:05:03.240
 so when I talked about census laws, that's an example.

1:05:03.240 --> 1:05:05.960
 So when you make the tariff so high

1:05:05.960 --> 1:05:10.960
 that you're going to render me, you know, noncompetitive,

1:05:10.960 --> 1:05:14.360
 then that's where, for people who might make sense,

1:05:14.360 --> 1:05:17.760
 when the product arrives at port, they say,

1:05:17.760 --> 1:05:20.400
 hey, I give you this.

1:05:20.400 --> 1:05:23.600
 What I give you, maybe it's 10% of the price or 5%.

1:05:23.600 --> 1:05:27.280
 It's surely not 40%, but you are happy with it.

1:05:27.280 --> 1:05:28.800
 You're the government official.

1:05:28.800 --> 1:05:30.440
 That's what we call a bribe.

1:05:30.440 --> 1:05:33.240
 And me, I'm like, hey, I saved myself money.

1:05:33.240 --> 1:05:35.720
 And also I saved myself time.

1:05:36.920 --> 1:05:40.040
 But you see, if the laws where you pay 5%

1:05:40.040 --> 1:05:43.320
 or even the 10% that I just left behind or nothing,

1:05:43.320 --> 1:05:45.080
 you come, you pay it, you move on.

1:05:45.080 --> 1:05:46.880
 Because who has a business of fooling around

1:05:46.880 --> 1:05:47.720
 and staying behind?

1:05:47.720 --> 1:05:51.240
 And no, you do that when it's actually makes sense to do that.

1:05:51.240 --> 1:05:52.920
 So I'm not sitting here telling people

1:05:52.920 --> 1:05:55.880
 I engage in unlawful practices in my case,

1:05:55.880 --> 1:05:58.480
 because I'm around saying the things I'm saying right now.

1:05:58.480 --> 1:06:00.280
 So I'm a target.

1:06:00.280 --> 1:06:01.520
 You have to do things cleanly.

1:06:01.520 --> 1:06:03.120
 And I believe in doing things that way.

1:06:03.120 --> 1:06:07.480
 So what I had to do was go to the ask again mayor.

1:06:07.480 --> 1:06:08.640
 We have a problem.

1:06:08.640 --> 1:06:10.840
 Mayors, whenever he sees me, he's like, now what?

1:06:10.840 --> 1:06:13.760
 So I'm like, we've got a problem.

1:06:13.760 --> 1:06:15.960
 You're best friends now.

1:06:15.960 --> 1:06:18.440
 So I say, now it's the customs.

1:06:18.440 --> 1:06:20.480
 And he's like, what do you want me to do?

1:06:20.480 --> 1:06:21.880
 I said, do you know anybody at customs?

1:06:21.880 --> 1:06:23.080
 I need to hire up at customs,

1:06:23.080 --> 1:06:25.960
 because I got to explain to them what's going on here.

1:06:25.960 --> 1:06:27.280
 They all know, of course,

1:06:27.280 --> 1:06:29.960
 but I think they're not always maybe understanding

1:06:29.960 --> 1:06:30.800
 or maybe they understand.

1:06:30.800 --> 1:06:33.200
 And in this case, he understood.

1:06:33.200 --> 1:06:37.040
 So we went and he's like, yeah, I know this is not,

1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:39.880
 this is not very, yeah, this.

1:06:39.880 --> 1:06:41.400
 And I said, what do we do now?

1:06:41.400 --> 1:06:44.240
 And I saw him going through binders and binders

1:06:44.240 --> 1:06:47.600
 in his office, because he's going to try to go and look

1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:51.520
 where in the law can we find something

1:06:51.520 --> 1:06:55.520
 that can help me escape these rules.

1:06:55.520 --> 1:06:58.200
 And you know, the best he found Lex was,

1:06:58.200 --> 1:07:00.800
 oh, well here, see this one.

1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:03.040
 If you've been in business for two years,

1:07:03.040 --> 1:07:06.720
 then we can allow you, there's a special term for it.

1:07:06.720 --> 1:07:08.400
 It's French, it's technical.

1:07:08.400 --> 1:07:10.880
 We can allow you to bring your raw material,

1:07:11.760 --> 1:07:15.200
 but you have to tell us exactly how much you're bringing.

1:07:15.200 --> 1:07:17.240
 And it has to match your formulation because, you know,

1:07:17.240 --> 1:07:19.920
 they don't want you to bring in more that we need

1:07:19.920 --> 1:07:21.960
 and maybe sell some of that to the rest of the market

1:07:21.960 --> 1:07:24.120
 and they didn't make their money on it.

1:07:24.120 --> 1:07:27.040
 So there, it means I have to give them my recipe.

1:07:27.040 --> 1:07:30.800
 Imagine Coca Cola being asked to give their secret sauce

1:07:31.720 --> 1:07:34.000
 to government officials in a country

1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:36.320
 that you can't even know what might happen,

1:07:36.320 --> 1:07:37.960
 let alone even in business, you don't do that.

1:07:37.960 --> 1:07:40.000
 I mean, trade secrets are trade secrets,

1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:42.480
 but here you're asked to be putting it in front

1:07:42.480 --> 1:07:43.320
 of some people you don't know

1:07:43.320 --> 1:07:44.600
 where it's going to go after that.

1:07:44.600 --> 1:07:46.080
 Because there they get to see, okay,

1:07:46.080 --> 1:07:50.080
 her recipe calls for X amount of Candelilla Wax,

1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:56.000
 X amount of coconut oil.

1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:57.680
 Okay, and on top of that,

1:07:57.680 --> 1:08:00.360
 we have to think about how much foliage might there be or not

1:08:00.360 --> 1:08:03.480
 because again, we don't want her to buffer it over there.

1:08:03.480 --> 1:08:05.480
 So you have to get naked in front of them

1:08:05.480 --> 1:08:06.520
 in terms of your recipe,

1:08:06.520 --> 1:08:08.760
 which might end up only God knows where tomorrow,

1:08:08.760 --> 1:08:11.040
 maybe competition or maybe even them,

1:08:11.040 --> 1:08:12.560
 they start a business and they compete with you

1:08:12.560 --> 1:08:13.640
 because we've seen that.

1:08:13.640 --> 1:08:15.240
 So you have to do that.

1:08:15.240 --> 1:08:18.000
 And then each time fill out a paperwork,

1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:19.480
 get the approval, then it can come in.

1:08:19.480 --> 1:08:21.840
 So when it can come in, you don't have to pay the tax.

1:08:21.840 --> 1:08:24.040
 Oh, and by the way, you have one year,

1:08:24.040 --> 1:08:26.920
 one year to make this product and get it out.

1:08:26.920 --> 1:08:28.760
 And all of it needs to be back out

1:08:28.760 --> 1:08:30.560
 because if any of it stays here,

1:08:30.560 --> 1:08:33.200
 you're going to pay the taxes that we held up.

1:08:33.200 --> 1:08:38.200
 So you're basically forced by these census laws

1:08:38.880 --> 1:08:41.920
 to be dishonest if you want to succeed.

1:08:41.920 --> 1:08:43.680
 All of this is so cumbersome

1:08:43.680 --> 1:08:47.320
 because it means more paperwork, paperwork everywhere,

1:08:47.320 --> 1:08:48.960
 maybe having to disclose your things.

1:08:48.960 --> 1:08:53.800
 So me, in my case, what I did is this person said,

1:08:53.800 --> 1:08:56.920
 okay, we're going to see how we can work with you.

1:08:56.920 --> 1:08:58.560
 But for the first two years,

1:08:58.560 --> 1:09:00.640
 we were more or less in the gray area.

1:09:00.640 --> 1:09:04.200
 Yeah, so even gray area is good.

1:09:04.200 --> 1:09:05.800
 Yeah, but what does it mean?

1:09:05.800 --> 1:09:07.160
 In a situation like that,

1:09:07.160 --> 1:09:09.240
 whenever they want to mess with you,

1:09:09.240 --> 1:09:11.520
 it means they can come and they will look

1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:13.240
 and they will find something.

1:09:13.240 --> 1:09:15.640
 So it means that every day I'm trying to do business,

1:09:15.640 --> 1:09:17.920
 I'm running the risk of being harassed

1:09:17.920 --> 1:09:21.360
 and or maybe even put in jail, depending on what it is.

1:09:21.360 --> 1:09:24.840
 I mean, you're an incredible person

1:09:24.840 --> 1:09:28.660
 because it seems like there's two ways to change this.

1:09:28.660 --> 1:09:33.660
 One is to become president or gain power in the country

1:09:34.340 --> 1:09:37.120
 and to try to change the laws,

1:09:37.120 --> 1:09:39.780
 which seems really difficult to do.

1:09:39.780 --> 1:09:43.180
 And the other way is fight through the laws

1:09:43.180 --> 1:09:45.040
 and create the business anyway,

1:09:45.040 --> 1:09:47.880
 build the business community and through that method,

1:09:47.880 --> 1:09:50.900
 create a huge amount of pressure to change the laws.

1:09:50.900 --> 1:09:53.860
 You're totally getting it with your last part

1:09:53.860 --> 1:09:55.420
 because this is the other thing.

1:09:55.420 --> 1:09:58.500
 And this is where I get so upset sometimes

1:09:58.500 --> 1:10:00.460
 with my fellow Africans

1:10:00.460 --> 1:10:04.460
 because they get so disgusted by what they're seeing, right?

1:10:04.460 --> 1:10:08.180
 And they think the answer is to go for politics.

1:10:08.180 --> 1:10:09.340
 Let's go be president.

1:10:09.340 --> 1:10:10.180
 Let's go be this.

1:10:10.180 --> 1:10:11.000
 Let's go be that.

1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:12.020
 And we're gonna change everything.

1:10:12.020 --> 1:10:13.540
 I see that in the US too.

1:10:13.540 --> 1:10:15.980
 People thinking that presidents have all this power.

1:10:15.980 --> 1:10:17.580
 Do you know who has the least power in government?

1:10:17.580 --> 1:10:18.660
 The president.

1:10:18.660 --> 1:10:20.580
 I mean, people don't get that.

1:10:20.580 --> 1:10:23.620
 Your best bet, if you insist on going into politics,

1:10:23.620 --> 1:10:25.380
 stick to the local level.

1:10:25.380 --> 1:10:28.380
 That's where all the skeletons are buried and hidden.

1:10:28.380 --> 1:10:31.220
 And that's where you can make the most impact, local level.

1:10:31.220 --> 1:10:32.140
 I know it's not shiny.

1:10:32.140 --> 1:10:34.640
 I know it's not exciting, but that's where it's at.

1:10:34.640 --> 1:10:37.920
 So if you must go into politics, but there's another way.

1:10:37.920 --> 1:10:40.140
 So in my case, what I do is two things.

1:10:40.140 --> 1:10:41.920
 I preach and I practice.

1:10:41.920 --> 1:10:44.260
 I preach, when I'm here talking to you about this,

1:10:44.260 --> 1:10:45.380
 I'm preaching.

1:10:45.380 --> 1:10:48.140
 I am sharing with people that is which I found.

1:10:48.140 --> 1:10:51.300
 And by the way, the answer was there.

1:10:51.300 --> 1:10:52.900
 I was doing these two businesses,

1:10:52.900 --> 1:10:54.880
 realizing the difference in treatment

1:10:54.880 --> 1:10:58.140
 of the doing business environment

1:10:58.140 --> 1:11:00.980
 of the US compared to the doing business environment

1:11:00.980 --> 1:11:02.180
 of Senegal.

1:11:02.180 --> 1:11:04.460
 And at first I was like, of course, us,

1:11:04.460 --> 1:11:05.660
 everything is messed up.

1:11:05.660 --> 1:11:07.480
 It's because we're a poor country.

1:11:07.480 --> 1:11:09.660
 But when I started to put two and two together,

1:11:09.660 --> 1:11:12.020
 I'm like, you're poor because you have no money,

1:11:12.020 --> 1:11:14.740
 at least not enough money to take care of your basic needs.

1:11:14.740 --> 1:11:17.700
 You have no money because you have no source of income.

1:11:17.700 --> 1:11:21.100
 Where does a source of income come from for most of us?

1:11:21.100 --> 1:11:23.540
 It comes from a job, doesn't it?

1:11:23.540 --> 1:11:26.220
 And then some people, sometimes at my UC Berkeley class,

1:11:26.220 --> 1:11:29.100
 they say, oh no, it comes from government too.

1:11:29.100 --> 1:11:30.980
 I'm like, I would like to think that even if you work

1:11:30.980 --> 1:11:32.500
 for government, you're going to be paid something, right?

1:11:32.500 --> 1:11:33.340
 And they're like, yeah.

1:11:33.340 --> 1:11:35.780
 And then even before I can say something, they're like,

1:11:35.780 --> 1:11:39.420
 yeah, because that money we use to pay our public officials

1:11:39.420 --> 1:11:43.680
 comes from taxes, you know, employers, employees,

1:11:43.680 --> 1:11:45.980
 we go back to the private sector for most of it,

1:11:45.980 --> 1:11:47.940
 from where this whole thing is created.

1:11:47.940 --> 1:11:52.060
 So it's clear, you're poor because you have no money,

1:11:52.060 --> 1:11:53.580
 no money because no source of income,

1:11:53.580 --> 1:11:55.340
 source of income for most of us is a job.

1:11:55.340 --> 1:11:57.940
 We're talking about, so where do jobs come from?

1:11:57.940 --> 1:12:00.020
 The private sector, primarily small

1:12:00.020 --> 1:12:01.540
 and medium sized enterprises.

1:12:01.540 --> 1:12:06.500
 Then don't you think that we should make it easy,

1:12:06.500 --> 1:12:11.500
 that we should have a friendly doing business environment.

1:12:12.660 --> 1:12:17.660
 And also a lot of it comes not just from the small

1:12:17.780 --> 1:12:21.900
 and medium sized businesses, but I think a lot

1:12:21.900 --> 1:12:26.300
 of the values created from new ones being launched, right?

1:12:26.300 --> 1:12:29.220
 It's not just like me, like saving somehow

1:12:29.220 --> 1:12:32.540
 through regulation, the ones that are already there.

1:12:32.540 --> 1:12:35.460
 It's like letting the market,

1:12:35.460 --> 1:12:38.940
 letting the new better ideas flourish.

1:12:38.940 --> 1:12:42.100
 It's about what I mean by doing business environment

1:12:42.100 --> 1:12:45.420
 is all the things that you and I talked about earlier.

1:12:45.420 --> 1:12:47.860
 Even the access of electricity is part

1:12:47.860 --> 1:12:49.700
 of a doing business, but doing business.

1:12:49.700 --> 1:12:52.060
 So basically when I discovered all of that,

1:12:52.060 --> 1:12:54.180
 when I put all of those dots together,

1:12:54.180 --> 1:12:56.540
 then I'm like, well, I guess the business,

1:12:56.540 --> 1:12:58.060
 and it makes sense, Lex.

1:12:58.060 --> 1:12:59.780
 If you want to grow tomatoes,

1:12:59.780 --> 1:13:01.220
 you're gonna have to have two things.

1:13:01.220 --> 1:13:05.940
 One is a good seed, right, that has good attributes.

1:13:05.940 --> 1:13:09.580
 And then you're gonna have to have a good environment

1:13:09.580 --> 1:13:10.580
 for it.

1:13:10.580 --> 1:13:12.420
 Is the soil the right one?

1:13:12.420 --> 1:13:14.180
 What's your pH level?

1:13:14.180 --> 1:13:16.100
 All of those good nutrients that you're gonna put in it.

1:13:16.100 --> 1:13:18.180
 Is it in a place that has tons of sun?

1:13:18.180 --> 1:13:19.940
 How much sun exposure or not?

1:13:19.940 --> 1:13:21.500
 The climate in general, is it gonna be cold?

1:13:21.500 --> 1:13:22.460
 Not, not.

1:13:22.460 --> 1:13:25.140
 You can have some beautiful tomatoes

1:13:25.140 --> 1:13:27.340
 in the middle of Siberia, last time I checked.

1:13:27.340 --> 1:13:28.500
 So same thing here.

1:13:28.500 --> 1:13:33.060
 You know, Mohammed Yunus, the Nobel Laureate for Peace,

1:13:33.060 --> 1:13:36.620
 said, poor people are bonsai people.

1:13:38.460 --> 1:13:40.380
 They're the same people.

1:13:40.380 --> 1:13:44.860
 If you put them in the normal, natural, friendly habitat

1:13:44.860 --> 1:13:48.220
 where they can thrive, they become the tallest tree

1:13:48.220 --> 1:13:49.620
 in the forest.

1:13:49.620 --> 1:13:51.380
 Poor people are bonsai people.

1:13:51.380 --> 1:13:55.460
 So you see that tiny pot you put around the bonsai tree?

1:13:55.460 --> 1:13:57.940
 That's the tiny pot that's created

1:13:57.940 --> 1:14:02.020
 by giving me such a hostile business environment

1:14:02.020 --> 1:14:05.420
 that basically we're put together by the set of laws

1:14:05.420 --> 1:14:08.980
 that you have put, that basically I have to jump through

1:14:08.980 --> 1:14:12.820
 as a business person, practicing business in my country.

1:14:12.820 --> 1:14:17.820
 If you turn that environment into a friendly environment

1:14:18.100 --> 1:14:20.660
 where I am not married to my employees,

1:14:20.660 --> 1:14:24.180
 I have flexibility of the labor laws

1:14:24.180 --> 1:14:26.900
 are simple, straightforward, clean,

1:14:26.900 --> 1:14:29.580
 where the tax code is very simple.

1:14:29.580 --> 1:14:32.500
 It's not worth truckloads of laws like in my country.

1:14:32.500 --> 1:14:33.580
 It's so complicated.

1:14:33.580 --> 1:14:36.060
 You have to hire a CPA, which costs more money.

1:14:36.060 --> 1:14:38.620
 And even them tell them, girl, we're gonna make some mistakes.

1:14:38.620 --> 1:14:39.940
 They don't talk to me like that.

1:14:39.940 --> 1:14:43.500
 They don't tell me, girl, they shouldn't, they better not.

1:14:43.500 --> 1:14:45.460
 But they say, whatever they say.

1:14:45.460 --> 1:14:46.300
 They say.

1:14:46.300 --> 1:14:47.140
 I'm scared.

1:14:47.140 --> 1:14:47.980
 You know.

1:14:47.980 --> 1:14:51.420
 You know, they're like, we're gonna,

1:14:51.420 --> 1:14:53.700
 but bottom line is we're gonna make mistakes.

1:14:53.700 --> 1:14:55.460
 This thing is so complicated, we're gonna make mistakes.

1:14:55.460 --> 1:14:57.940
 So, which means my ass is on the line.

1:14:57.940 --> 1:15:02.020
 So anyway, so if the tax code was so simple,

1:15:02.020 --> 1:15:04.540
 straightforward, like it is maybe in Texas,

1:15:04.540 --> 1:15:07.380
 where up till a threshold, you owe me nothing,

1:15:07.380 --> 1:15:10.380
 go online, five minutes, fill out your taxes,

1:15:10.380 --> 1:15:13.660
 you're compliant, keep building your business

1:15:13.660 --> 1:15:15.100
 because that's what we need from you.

1:15:15.100 --> 1:15:19.860
 If you made it so easy and straightforward,

1:15:19.860 --> 1:15:20.820
 then you know what?

1:15:20.820 --> 1:15:22.740
 That's when you get all of these people,

1:15:22.740 --> 1:15:25.740
 Lex, that you're talking about saying, you know what?

1:15:25.740 --> 1:15:28.380
 My name is Aminata,

1:15:28.380 --> 1:15:30.580
 and I live in the middle of nowhere, Senegal.

1:15:30.580 --> 1:15:31.420
 But you know what?

1:15:31.420 --> 1:15:33.500
 I've got this great idea for this really hot,

1:15:33.500 --> 1:15:35.860
 nice hot sauce that I know the Americans are gonna love.

1:15:35.860 --> 1:15:38.460
 I'm hearing that hot sauce is a big thing.

1:15:38.460 --> 1:15:39.900
 Let me bring it to them.

1:15:39.900 --> 1:15:41.620
 But everything is there for you to jump

1:15:41.620 --> 1:15:44.020
 into the ring of entrepreneurship.

1:15:44.020 --> 1:15:47.220
 You don't have to know someone like my God.

1:15:47.220 --> 1:15:50.300
 You don't have to even have the ability

1:15:50.300 --> 1:15:53.260
 to sell yourself maybe like I can sometimes.

1:15:53.260 --> 1:15:57.180
 You are someone with a great idea.

1:15:57.180 --> 1:15:59.340
 You're willing to work hard for it

1:15:59.340 --> 1:16:00.860
 and pour everything you got into it.

1:16:00.860 --> 1:16:01.700
 Guess what?

1:16:03.260 --> 1:16:04.100
 It's there.

1:16:04.100 --> 1:16:05.380
 You can get into the race.

1:16:05.380 --> 1:16:07.020
 You can be a dreamer,

1:16:07.020 --> 1:16:09.780
 and you can be a dreamer in a rural little village.

1:16:09.780 --> 1:16:11.580
 And then that has ripple effects

1:16:11.580 --> 1:16:12.660
 throughout the entire country.

1:16:12.660 --> 1:16:14.180
 Young kids growing up, you know,

1:16:14.180 --> 1:16:16.820
 I wanna be the next X, whatever.

1:16:16.820 --> 1:16:19.860
 And it doesn't have to be the next Steve Jobs.

1:16:19.860 --> 1:16:21.980
 That seems really far, far away.

1:16:21.980 --> 1:16:23.660
 It's at all levels.

1:16:23.660 --> 1:16:28.660
 You create local heroes because representation matters.

1:16:29.740 --> 1:16:30.580
 Right?

1:16:30.580 --> 1:16:33.900
 So, and we are so badly in need of that.

1:16:33.900 --> 1:16:36.140
 And so that's what all the things

1:16:36.140 --> 1:16:37.340
 that have been stolen from us

1:16:37.340 --> 1:16:39.300
 as long as things remain the same.

1:16:39.300 --> 1:16:42.820
 So Lex, once I found out that basically at the end of the day

1:16:42.820 --> 1:16:45.060
 the answer is economic freedom.

1:16:45.060 --> 1:16:46.460
 And that when it comes to that,

1:16:46.460 --> 1:16:48.980
 the indexes, economic indexes that measure that,

1:16:48.980 --> 1:16:50.620
 whether it's the doing business index ranking

1:16:50.620 --> 1:16:51.580
 of the World Bank,

1:16:51.580 --> 1:16:54.380
 or the Fraser Economic Freedom Index

1:16:54.380 --> 1:16:56.060
 of the Heritage Foundation.

1:16:56.060 --> 1:16:58.740
 When you look at all of those indexes and others,

1:16:58.740 --> 1:17:00.540
 what do they have in common?

1:17:00.540 --> 1:17:02.100
 One after another they show you

1:17:02.100 --> 1:17:04.340
 that it is harder to do business

1:17:04.340 --> 1:17:06.340
 in almost anywhere in Sub Saharan Africa

1:17:06.340 --> 1:17:10.340
 than it is per se anywhere in Scandinavia.

1:17:10.340 --> 1:17:13.740
 So it is telling you that Scandinavian nations,

1:17:13.740 --> 1:17:16.260
 that socialist Americans tend to love so much

1:17:16.260 --> 1:17:17.340
 and take as an example,

1:17:17.340 --> 1:17:18.500
 although there too they're showing you

1:17:18.500 --> 1:17:19.340
 that they don't understand

1:17:19.340 --> 1:17:21.940
 what's going on really in Scandinavia,

1:17:21.940 --> 1:17:25.180
 that Scandinavia is more capitalist.

1:17:25.180 --> 1:17:27.140
 Scandinavian nations are more capitalist

1:17:27.140 --> 1:17:30.260
 than almost any Sub Saharan African nations.

1:17:30.260 --> 1:17:32.820
 Ultimately, the political systems

1:17:32.820 --> 1:17:35.940
 actually don't even matter nearly as much

1:17:35.940 --> 1:17:39.660
 as the private sector being able

1:17:39.660 --> 1:17:42.220
 to operate the machinery of capitalism.

1:17:42.220 --> 1:17:45.100
 There you go, there you go, there you go.

1:17:45.100 --> 1:17:47.140
 And it's almost like, like I said,

1:17:47.140 --> 1:17:49.660
 it's almost like its own little widget within it.

1:17:49.660 --> 1:17:51.380
 You can have whatever type of society

1:17:51.380 --> 1:17:52.220
 you want to practice,

1:17:52.220 --> 1:17:55.420
 you want to exercise at whatever level you want to.

1:17:55.420 --> 1:17:59.420
 But if you're serious about becoming a capitalist,

1:17:59.420 --> 1:18:03.660
 becoming a middle to high income nation,

1:18:03.660 --> 1:18:07.740
 there is no other pathway that we know of at this point.

1:18:07.740 --> 1:18:11.300
 And you know what made me super excited about that

1:18:11.300 --> 1:18:15.220
 beyond having finally found my answer.

1:18:16.700 --> 1:18:18.700
 I have to tell you when I found that answer,

1:18:18.700 --> 1:18:21.180
 I literally fell to my knees.

1:18:21.180 --> 1:18:23.260
 It was the type of feeling that,

1:18:24.540 --> 1:18:28.340
 you know, if something is not well with you,

1:18:28.340 --> 1:18:30.460
 whether it's physical or mental,

1:18:30.460 --> 1:18:32.820
 something is not well, you're not well.

1:18:32.820 --> 1:18:35.540
 And you go around and you go to the so called specialists,

1:18:35.540 --> 1:18:37.260
 some of them, you know,

1:18:37.260 --> 1:18:39.180
 but you're going around for years,

1:18:39.180 --> 1:18:42.860
 going around trying to get help for your ailment.

1:18:42.860 --> 1:18:45.700
 And here they don't know.

1:18:45.700 --> 1:18:48.500
 Here they tell you things that you can't tell why,

1:18:48.500 --> 1:18:50.340
 but you just know it's not true.

1:18:50.340 --> 1:18:51.940
 They're this, they're that.

1:18:51.940 --> 1:18:54.340
 And it's going on for years after year after year.

1:18:54.340 --> 1:18:56.740
 And finally you meet this one person

1:18:56.740 --> 1:19:00.020
 and boom, it's there.

1:19:01.620 --> 1:19:02.940
 Not only the liberation,

1:19:05.260 --> 1:19:07.860
 but also this whole new world that comes with it.

1:19:07.860 --> 1:19:12.860
 You know, I'm still ill, but guess what?

1:19:13.020 --> 1:19:14.620
 There's a path forward.

1:19:14.620 --> 1:19:16.300
 We know that.

1:19:16.300 --> 1:19:20.020
 I'm going to have a lot of work to do, but there's hope.

1:19:20.020 --> 1:19:23.900
 Yeah, and you're the beacon of hope actually,

1:19:23.900 --> 1:19:25.820
 for a lot of people in that part of the world.

1:19:25.820 --> 1:19:28.260
 And those beacons are actually really necessary.

1:19:28.260 --> 1:19:32.540
 So not only is there hope, but you can become,

1:19:32.540 --> 1:19:37.540
 I mean, the beacon for your people, your home,

1:19:37.900 --> 1:19:40.820
 this power that you see that you feel all around

1:19:40.820 --> 1:19:45.820
 to become, to escape the feeling of being trapped.

1:19:46.500 --> 1:19:51.260
 Is there a device you can give to people that,

1:19:51.260 --> 1:19:56.260
 to young girls and boys dreaming somewhere in Africa

1:19:56.820 --> 1:19:58.900
 of how to change the world?

1:19:58.900 --> 1:19:59.740
 That's right.

1:19:59.740 --> 1:20:03.060
 And by the way, I want to say there are bigger beacons.

1:20:03.060 --> 1:20:05.180
 There are better beacons than me.

1:20:05.180 --> 1:20:08.940
 I just happen to be someone who has the chance

1:20:08.940 --> 1:20:10.340
 of talking to you right now.

1:20:11.620 --> 1:20:14.540
 And one of my goals is to open the same doors

1:20:14.540 --> 1:20:17.500
 that were opened for me, because together, our voice,

1:20:17.500 --> 1:20:20.180
 there's such amazing stories out there.

1:20:20.180 --> 1:20:25.180
 And so bigger beacons, better beacons out there.

1:20:26.460 --> 1:20:31.460
 One thing here for me, the reason why I do

1:20:32.140 --> 1:20:34.860
 what I'm doing right now, and it's almost to a point

1:20:34.860 --> 1:20:36.660
 of self destructing my own health.

1:20:37.740 --> 1:20:41.100
 I feel invested with such the mission of,

1:20:41.100 --> 1:20:43.620
 I have been afforded the truth.

1:20:43.620 --> 1:20:45.980
 So it is my moral duty to try to take it around.

1:20:45.980 --> 1:20:48.260
 I know I sound, people sometimes say,

1:20:48.260 --> 1:20:51.900
 when I listen to you, I feel like I'm talking to a priest.

1:20:51.900 --> 1:20:56.900
 And I'm like, because the gospel, I receive the gospel.

1:20:56.900 --> 1:20:59.660
 So anyway, but the thing is, Lex,

1:20:59.660 --> 1:21:03.140
 who tells you these things to this day?

1:21:03.140 --> 1:21:04.980
 When they talk about the poverty of Africa,

1:21:04.980 --> 1:21:06.220
 what do they talk about?

1:21:06.220 --> 1:21:07.140
 They sit in front telling you,

1:21:07.140 --> 1:21:08.580
 oh yeah, it's because of colonialism.

1:21:08.580 --> 1:21:09.980
 It's because of racism.

1:21:09.980 --> 1:21:11.260
 It's because of imperialism.

1:21:11.260 --> 1:21:14.580
 It's because they're stealing raw material, blah, blah, blah.

1:21:14.580 --> 1:21:19.580
 Is any of those guilty to some level of where we are today?

1:21:21.220 --> 1:21:23.820
 Maybe part of the reason where we are today?

1:21:23.820 --> 1:21:25.740
 Maybe, maybe.

1:21:25.740 --> 1:21:29.420
 Is that the only reason or the overwhelming reasons?

1:21:29.420 --> 1:21:30.420
 No.

1:21:30.420 --> 1:21:31.900
 Is that insurmountable?

1:21:31.900 --> 1:21:33.340
 Absolutely not.

1:21:33.340 --> 1:21:36.020
 So for me, don't stay in that place

1:21:36.020 --> 1:21:40.100
 that steals and robs you of your agency.

1:21:40.100 --> 1:21:43.140
 So I think it's important for people to A,

1:21:43.140 --> 1:21:45.820
 get the right diagnosis as to why we are where we are.

1:21:45.820 --> 1:21:48.020
 Because what you and I just talked about,

1:21:48.020 --> 1:21:50.660
 the mainstream does not talk about this

1:21:50.660 --> 1:21:52.580
 when they even talk about Africa

1:21:52.580 --> 1:21:55.580
 in terms that are not the usual suspect of,

1:21:55.580 --> 1:21:57.580
 oh, famine is building over there.

1:21:57.580 --> 1:21:58.660
 War is building over here.

1:21:58.660 --> 1:22:00.180
 Oh, we're having Ebola is coming.

1:22:00.180 --> 1:22:01.020
 All of that stuff.

1:22:01.020 --> 1:22:02.780
 Even when they were talking about the monkeypox,

1:22:02.780 --> 1:22:05.540
 which at first, in this wave,

1:22:05.540 --> 1:22:07.620
 it started with white people in Europe.

1:22:07.620 --> 1:22:09.820
 Well, even in the many newspapers you pull out,

1:22:09.820 --> 1:22:13.660
 it's black people with monkeypox on their skin.

1:22:13.660 --> 1:22:14.580
 I'm like, wait a second.

1:22:14.580 --> 1:22:17.020
 This time around, it did not start with us.

1:22:17.020 --> 1:22:18.820
 So why are you always showing us

1:22:18.820 --> 1:22:21.780
 when it's right now happening to white people?

1:22:21.780 --> 1:22:24.060
 So all of that is happening.

1:22:24.060 --> 1:22:26.380
 So for me, the thing is,

1:22:26.380 --> 1:22:29.380
 we, the world simply right now,

1:22:29.380 --> 1:22:32.060
 does not have the right diagnosis

1:22:32.060 --> 1:22:34.260
 as to why this continent right now,

1:22:34.260 --> 1:22:36.180
 despite all of its riches,

1:22:36.180 --> 1:22:37.900
 because Lord knows it's got riches

1:22:37.900 --> 1:22:40.140
 starting it with its young population.

1:22:40.140 --> 1:22:42.020
 75% of the population in my country

1:22:42.020 --> 1:22:44.260
 is below the age of 25 years old.

1:22:44.260 --> 1:22:47.660
 So when we're talking, I know we're talking about,

1:22:47.660 --> 1:22:50.540
 repopulation, it's an important,

1:22:50.540 --> 1:22:52.220
 we're gonna have to go for that.

1:22:53.220 --> 1:22:54.580
 Maybe you'll get me going about comments,

1:22:54.580 --> 1:22:57.060
 I don't know, but anyway.

1:22:57.060 --> 1:22:58.380
 So here, my point is,

1:22:58.380 --> 1:22:59.820
 A, we need the right diagnosis

1:22:59.820 --> 1:23:02.220
 as to why this continent is the poorest continent

1:23:02.220 --> 1:23:03.780
 in the world, despite its riches

1:23:03.780 --> 1:23:05.700
 starting with its young people,

1:23:05.700 --> 1:23:08.540
 all the natural resources, diversity in land,

1:23:08.540 --> 1:23:10.500
 people, cultures, languages,

1:23:10.500 --> 1:23:15.380
 everything that make for great ingredient for awesomeness.

1:23:15.380 --> 1:23:16.540
 Despite all of that,

1:23:16.540 --> 1:23:18.300
 we are the poorest region in the world.

1:23:18.300 --> 1:23:21.500
 People need to know that the reason why that is,

1:23:21.500 --> 1:23:23.660
 it's because we also happen to be

1:23:23.660 --> 1:23:27.420
 the most overregulated region in the world.

1:23:27.420 --> 1:23:30.140
 At the end of the day, what Africa,

1:23:30.140 --> 1:23:32.060
 and I dare to say Africa here,

1:23:32.060 --> 1:23:34.020
 and treated as one,

1:23:34.020 --> 1:23:37.220
 we are 54 countries, 55 depending on how you count,

1:23:37.220 --> 1:23:42.220
 yet we almost for a tiny minority of these countries,

1:23:43.220 --> 1:23:48.100
 we almost all lack one of the most crucial freedoms

1:23:48.100 --> 1:23:49.300
 that there are.

1:23:49.300 --> 1:23:51.700
 If you're serious about prosperity building,

1:23:51.700 --> 1:23:54.300
 we lack economic freedom.

1:23:54.300 --> 1:23:55.820
 And economic freedom is the thing

1:23:55.820 --> 1:23:58.740
 that unlocks that human potential of the young people just.

1:23:58.740 --> 1:24:01.220
 Yes, for them to run,

1:24:01.220 --> 1:24:05.140
 to run with their ideas, to start businesses,

1:24:05.140 --> 1:24:06.340
 or to start initiative.

1:24:06.340 --> 1:24:08.900
 It doesn't have to be for profit all the time, right?

1:24:08.900 --> 1:24:12.660
 But it is this thing that gets you to get up

1:24:12.660 --> 1:24:15.980
 and go and do something, criticize by creating.

1:24:15.980 --> 1:24:17.620
 Young people are naturally wired

1:24:17.620 --> 1:24:19.300
 to wanna criticize by creating.

1:24:19.300 --> 1:24:21.900
 They're not sitting around waiting or complaining usually,

1:24:21.900 --> 1:24:23.260
 unless you put them in a tiny box

1:24:23.260 --> 1:24:24.740
 and they have no other way to go.

1:24:24.740 --> 1:24:26.940
 And in this situation, what they do,

1:24:26.940 --> 1:24:29.180
 let's talk about precolonial Africa,

1:24:29.180 --> 1:24:33.060
 of four favors before slavery ever happened.

1:24:33.060 --> 1:24:35.300
 There were black people on the continent.

1:24:35.300 --> 1:24:37.660
 You see, when we talk about the story of black people

1:24:37.660 --> 1:24:40.980
 and Africans, black people in Africa,

1:24:40.980 --> 1:24:42.700
 for most of us, even me,

1:24:43.860 --> 1:24:46.980
 I noticed that unconsciously it starts with slavery.

1:24:46.980 --> 1:24:49.140
 But you're like, no, we were there before,

1:24:49.140 --> 1:24:50.340
 before white men ever set foot.

1:24:50.340 --> 1:24:51.340
 Who were we?

1:24:51.340 --> 1:24:54.460
 What were we doing in our diversity?

1:24:54.460 --> 1:24:58.500
 What economic systems were we running on?

1:24:58.500 --> 1:25:00.420
 And then you realize that for most of them,

1:25:00.420 --> 1:25:02.060
 they were free marketeers

1:25:02.060 --> 1:25:03.620
 and they were very much on the free trade,

1:25:03.620 --> 1:25:05.340
 on the free enterprise side.

1:25:05.340 --> 1:25:07.300
 So even that is a reinforcement.

1:25:07.300 --> 1:25:11.820
 This is a place where we do not understand our history.

1:25:11.820 --> 1:25:14.940
 So proper diagnosis, Africa is a poorest region in the world

1:25:14.940 --> 1:25:16.260
 because it happens to be

1:25:16.260 --> 1:25:19.060
 the most overregulated region in the world,

1:25:19.060 --> 1:25:20.820
 lacks economic freedom.

1:25:20.820 --> 1:25:22.540
 Number two, what do we do about that?

1:25:22.540 --> 1:25:25.940
 We gotta become serious about reforms, economic reforms,

1:25:25.940 --> 1:25:30.940
 so that we can become beacons of free markets.

1:25:30.940 --> 1:25:32.420
 Just like the Asian tigers,

1:25:32.420 --> 1:25:33.980
 that's what the Asian tigers did.

1:25:33.980 --> 1:25:35.300
 They had to become serious.

1:25:35.300 --> 1:25:38.780
 Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea,

1:25:38.780 --> 1:25:43.140
 those guys had to become serious about the free markets.

1:25:43.140 --> 1:25:48.140
 Lee Kuan Woo, he's just like, we gotta do something.

1:25:48.740 --> 1:25:51.900
 And he looked around and he realized at some point,

1:25:51.900 --> 1:25:53.220
 we gotta make these reforms.

1:25:53.220 --> 1:25:56.180
 And he went onto that journey of reforms,

1:25:56.180 --> 1:25:59.060
 making his country one of the most free market countries

1:25:59.060 --> 1:26:02.100
 in the world, and voila, the magic happened.

1:26:02.100 --> 1:26:05.860
 Back in the 30s, the stock market crash

1:26:05.860 --> 1:26:08.100
 and the Great Depression and everything,

1:26:08.100 --> 1:26:11.300
 the world and with all the lies that were told

1:26:11.300 --> 1:26:15.020
 to the world coming from the Soviet Union, Stalin,

1:26:15.020 --> 1:26:17.380
 while they were starving and dying over there,

1:26:17.380 --> 1:26:20.660
 but oh no, I mean, Durante was telling the world that,

1:26:20.660 --> 1:26:22.140
 oh no, no, everything is going well,

1:26:22.140 --> 1:26:24.100
 nobody's dying when we know now

1:26:24.100 --> 1:26:26.460
 and getting political prices based on this stuff.

1:26:26.460 --> 1:26:29.060
 But then the world went on believing that,

1:26:29.060 --> 1:26:31.580
 oh no, capitalism failed.

1:26:31.580 --> 1:26:36.580
 This crash that you had in the stock market

1:26:37.780 --> 1:26:40.820
 is proof this is what late stage capitalism produces.

1:26:40.820 --> 1:26:42.900
 You guys always have your big ups and downs.

1:26:42.900 --> 1:26:44.740
 And by that time, it was so hard on people

1:26:44.740 --> 1:26:46.300
 that they're like, we're done with this.

1:26:46.300 --> 1:26:48.180
 And at the same time, we were told the lies

1:26:48.180 --> 1:26:49.020
 coming out of the Soviet Union,

1:26:49.020 --> 1:26:51.780
 that supposedly the communism was doing just fine.

1:26:51.780 --> 1:26:54.500
 And you're at the point where the free market concept

1:26:54.500 --> 1:26:59.500
 almost died and it's the Asian tigers

1:26:59.780 --> 1:27:04.460
 who kind of helped bring that idea back to life, right?

1:27:04.460 --> 1:27:06.740
 Their success having used the free markets.

1:27:06.740 --> 1:27:11.580
 And so for me, we gotta make a new commitment

1:27:11.580 --> 1:27:12.980
 to the free markets on this continent

1:27:12.980 --> 1:27:15.620
 if we wanna go anywhere, if we wanna go anywhere.

1:27:15.620 --> 1:27:18.660
 And the timing is perfect because the young people,

1:27:18.660 --> 1:27:22.660
 there is a kind of freedom

1:27:22.660 --> 1:27:25.740
 for the revolutionary free markets in this whole space.

1:27:25.740 --> 1:27:28.980
 Exactly, and you said something, oh, say that again,

1:27:28.980 --> 1:27:30.780
 because I wanna tell you what I'm hearing in that,

1:27:30.780 --> 1:27:31.700
 because something's really cool.

1:27:31.700 --> 1:27:32.940
 Say it again, come on, Lex.

1:27:32.940 --> 1:27:36.460
 I don't know which part, English is my second language too.

1:27:36.460 --> 1:27:40.620
 No, you said there's something revolutionary in that.

1:27:40.620 --> 1:27:41.900
 Because you know how young people are attached

1:27:41.900 --> 1:27:45.140
 to the revolution and how, I understand,

1:27:45.140 --> 1:27:49.540
 look Lex, I understand and I am willing

1:27:49.540 --> 1:27:51.900
 to give the benefits of a doubt

1:27:51.900 --> 1:27:55.700
 to some of these socialists who came to it

1:27:55.700 --> 1:27:58.260
 because they had to witness

1:27:58.260 --> 1:28:02.020
 some of the horrors of their times.

1:28:03.300 --> 1:28:05.180
 There's a revolutionary spirit behind that.

1:28:05.180 --> 1:28:08.740
 It's ultimately criticized by creating.

1:28:08.740 --> 1:28:11.300
 Exactly, exactly, but violent revolution

1:28:11.300 --> 1:28:12.660
 is never the answer.

1:28:12.660 --> 1:28:15.380
 But that's what they went for in 1789 in France,

1:28:15.380 --> 1:28:19.260
 the French Revolution, and Marx and Engels,

1:28:19.260 --> 1:28:21.820
 they're promoting these ideas that usually,

1:28:21.820 --> 1:28:24.060
 for them, justifies violent revolution.

1:28:24.060 --> 1:28:25.540
 Then in all of these people,

1:28:27.020 --> 1:28:30.020
 I am with them when they say that they want

1:28:30.020 --> 1:28:32.020
 to see equal rights for people.

1:28:32.020 --> 1:28:33.420
 Of course, I don't agree with their,

1:28:33.420 --> 1:28:36.980
 therefore, we need to push for equal outcomes.

1:28:36.980 --> 1:28:39.740
 Equal rights is right, but equal outcomes is not right.

1:28:39.740 --> 1:28:43.060
 But I am with them for all the way to equal rights,

1:28:43.060 --> 1:28:45.780
 but this is where the two paths go this way.

1:28:45.780 --> 1:28:50.220
 And also, the fact that they have no issue

1:28:50.220 --> 1:28:53.460
 with violent revolution, people get killed.

1:28:53.460 --> 1:28:57.500
 People get put in gulags and people get, that's not right.

1:28:57.500 --> 1:28:59.820
 So what you just said here, just give me goosebumps,

1:28:59.820 --> 1:29:02.860
 because there is revolution in the free markets,

1:29:02.860 --> 1:29:04.740
 but that's the type of revolution we want.

1:29:04.740 --> 1:29:07.220
 The revolution that comes from people creating,

1:29:07.220 --> 1:29:09.620
 criticizing by creating, it's one of the best forms

1:29:09.620 --> 1:29:10.500
 of revolution.

1:29:10.500 --> 1:29:14.820
 If you ask me, that's the most sexy way of revolution.

1:29:14.820 --> 1:29:16.340
 Criticize by creating, but what,

1:29:16.340 --> 1:29:18.540
 you're gonna go shoot people or be like,

1:29:18.540 --> 1:29:22.700
 what's his name, Che Guevara, who tells you,

1:29:22.700 --> 1:29:25.140
 I love, it's in writing, I love nothing more

1:29:25.140 --> 1:29:30.140
 than to fry the brain of a man with his gun, really?

1:29:30.780 --> 1:29:35.620
 Well, in terms of sexy, there is power in that message

1:29:35.620 --> 1:29:40.620
 of the oppressor, the abuser, the enemy that has abused

1:29:41.060 --> 1:29:44.260
 their power, they need to be destroyed,

1:29:44.260 --> 1:29:47.620
 and there's power in the message of that violence.

1:29:47.620 --> 1:29:49.420
 Unfortunately, the lessons of history show

1:29:49.420 --> 1:29:53.140
 that the violence, one, doesn't work,

1:29:53.140 --> 1:29:55.900
 but it does the following.

1:29:55.900 --> 1:29:57.460
 There is something about human nature,

1:29:57.460 --> 1:29:59.580
 as the old cliche goes, that power corrupts

1:29:59.580 --> 1:30:01.660
 and absolute power corrupts absolutely,

1:30:01.660 --> 1:30:05.580
 is the people who are in charge of committing that violence

1:30:05.580 --> 1:30:07.780
 it does something to their head.

1:30:07.780 --> 1:30:10.940
 The first person you kill, the second person you kill,

1:30:10.940 --> 1:30:13.940
 for some reason, you lose your ability,

1:30:13.940 --> 1:30:16.140
 the compassion for other humans.

1:30:16.140 --> 1:30:18.580
 Even if you began as a revolutionary,

1:30:18.580 --> 1:30:21.340
 as the Soviets did, fighting for the worker,

1:30:21.340 --> 1:30:26.020
 for the rights and the basic humanity of the people

1:30:26.020 --> 1:30:31.020
 that really do the work, you lose the plot somehow

1:30:31.620 --> 1:30:33.620
 because of the violence.

1:30:33.620 --> 1:30:36.620
 So in that way, it seems like the lesson,

1:30:36.620 --> 1:30:38.780
 at least of this part of the human history,

1:30:38.780 --> 1:30:42.820
 until the robots take over, is that the economic freedom,

1:30:44.340 --> 1:30:46.860
 free markets, and protecting those,

1:30:46.860 --> 1:30:51.860
 and allowing anyone from your country to dream

1:30:53.420 --> 1:30:56.340
 and to make that dream a reality by creating it

1:30:56.340 --> 1:31:01.340
 with as few sort of roadblocks as possible.

1:31:01.340 --> 1:31:05.780
 Exactly, so that's why for me, the message is very clear,

1:31:05.780 --> 1:31:07.500
 is what we talked about today.

1:31:07.500 --> 1:31:09.500
 The reason why Africa is the poorest region in the world

1:31:09.500 --> 1:31:13.060
 is because it happens to be the most overregulated region

1:31:13.060 --> 1:31:17.980
 in the world, and for some people who might be put off by it

1:31:17.980 --> 1:31:20.500
 because they're like, oh, she's talking about laissez faire!

1:31:20.500 --> 1:31:24.740
 No, let me put it maybe in a way that you can understand.

1:31:24.740 --> 1:31:28.100
 Do you think that it should be as easy

1:31:28.100 --> 1:31:30.820
 for any person in Africa, for any entrepreneur in Africa

1:31:30.820 --> 1:31:35.020
 to enterprise than it is for any person in Scandinavia

1:31:35.020 --> 1:31:36.100
 to enterprise?

1:31:36.100 --> 1:31:38.940
 If your answer is yes, which I would hope it is,

1:31:38.940 --> 1:31:42.860
 then you have a moral obligation to work with me

1:31:42.860 --> 1:31:47.060
 to make my country, and as a whole, my continent,

1:31:47.060 --> 1:31:48.260
 more free markets.

1:31:48.260 --> 1:31:49.180
 It's that simple.

1:31:49.180 --> 1:31:51.180
 At that point, there's no like, yes,

1:31:51.180 --> 1:31:53.540
 but on the other hand, uh uh, no.

1:31:53.540 --> 1:31:54.580
 And for me, on that question,

1:31:54.580 --> 1:31:57.020
 and I yet have to find somebody who claims to say no.

1:31:57.020 --> 1:31:59.220
 If you say no, then we have a whole nother problem

1:31:59.220 --> 1:32:01.260
 that I'm not even talking to at that point anymore.

1:32:01.260 --> 1:32:02.100
 So yeah.

1:32:02.100 --> 1:32:06.860
 So just to clarify, there's a perception in some reality

1:32:06.860 --> 1:32:10.220
 that the Scandinavian countries have elements of socialism

1:32:10.220 --> 1:32:12.260
 in their politics, in their society,

1:32:12.260 --> 1:32:14.340
 even in their economics.

1:32:14.340 --> 1:32:18.620
 So at the very least, Africa should have,

1:32:18.620 --> 1:32:23.140
 in terms of economic indices, should be as free

1:32:23.140 --> 1:32:24.700
 as the Scandinavian countries.

1:32:24.700 --> 1:32:25.540
 You're just giving that example.

1:32:25.540 --> 1:32:27.100
 As economically free, yes.

1:32:27.100 --> 1:32:29.740
 Because see, the Scandinavian, they do have

1:32:32.140 --> 1:32:34.540
 a subsidized, you know, like a welfare system,

1:32:34.540 --> 1:32:37.620
 that's what, a more socialized welfare system,

1:32:37.620 --> 1:32:39.220
 but the way they make their money

1:32:39.220 --> 1:32:41.420
 is very much the way of the free markets.

1:32:41.420 --> 1:32:43.220
 So there is how you make your money,

1:32:43.220 --> 1:32:44.700
 and then there's how you maybe decide

1:32:44.700 --> 1:32:49.060
 as a country to redistribute it, right?

1:32:49.060 --> 1:32:54.060
 And so even there, even in Scandinavia,

1:32:54.220 --> 1:32:56.540
 again, yes, they have more economic freedom.

1:32:56.540 --> 1:33:00.820
 So then from there, Lex, where we go is my job

1:33:00.820 --> 1:33:05.820
 and my goal is for every single African, young and old,

1:33:08.500 --> 1:33:12.140
 to know what I have come to learn.

1:33:13.060 --> 1:33:14.260
 We are not doomed.

1:33:16.980 --> 1:33:18.620
 It's not over for us.

1:33:19.660 --> 1:33:21.220
 We will never catch up.

1:33:21.220 --> 1:33:24.740
 The time for catch up is gone, but guess what?

1:33:24.740 --> 1:33:27.580
 We've got a strong, strong possibility

1:33:27.580 --> 1:33:32.180
 and chance to leapfrog, and leapfrog we will.

1:33:33.100 --> 1:33:35.660
 It is still time, but for that to happen,

1:33:35.660 --> 1:33:36.980
 like I said, we need to know

1:33:36.980 --> 1:33:38.140
 what we just talked about today

1:33:38.140 --> 1:33:40.460
 because that is not what the mainstream

1:33:40.460 --> 1:33:41.860
 keeps us abreast with.

1:33:41.860 --> 1:33:43.780
 When you go to the World Bank,

1:33:43.780 --> 1:33:46.420
 they don't necessarily work along these lines.

1:33:46.420 --> 1:33:51.260
 They're still, it's not, when you go to universities,

1:33:51.260 --> 1:33:54.540
 I will ask you, MIT, the MIT Econ Department,

1:33:54.540 --> 1:33:57.020
 or even some, most of the professors,

1:33:57.020 --> 1:33:58.260
 are they free market oriented?

1:33:58.260 --> 1:34:01.100
 We find that oftentimes in academia,

1:34:01.100 --> 1:34:03.860
 there is a strong anti capitalist bias.

1:34:03.860 --> 1:34:06.940
 There is a strong anti free market bias.

1:34:06.940 --> 1:34:08.860
 So this is a problem.

1:34:08.860 --> 1:34:09.820
 This is a problem.

1:34:09.820 --> 1:34:11.860
 Nobody cares about the economists anyway.

1:34:11.860 --> 1:34:14.380
 Yeah, so we move forward.

1:34:14.380 --> 1:34:18.860
 In MIT, the spirit of the entrepreneur burns bright,

1:34:18.860 --> 1:34:20.980
 not in the economics department

1:34:20.980 --> 1:34:23.940
 because they just write op ed articles,

1:34:23.940 --> 1:34:26.380
 but in the dreamers, the young undergrads

1:34:26.380 --> 1:34:27.980
 that actually build something.

1:34:27.980 --> 1:34:28.820
 No, I get that.

1:34:28.820 --> 1:34:32.420
 But then we cannot be stifling their efforts

1:34:32.420 --> 1:34:37.340
 by putting these artificially made regulations and laws

1:34:37.340 --> 1:34:39.180
 that stand in the way and clip their wings.

1:34:39.180 --> 1:34:41.060
 So that's why when you were saying,

1:34:41.060 --> 1:34:43.180
 what advice do you give to them?

1:34:43.180 --> 1:34:47.140
 The advice I give to them is each one of them,

1:34:47.140 --> 1:34:51.540
 they have to pay attention to this discourse we just had.

1:34:51.540 --> 1:34:55.420
 I don't ask anybody to agree with me on face value.

1:34:55.420 --> 1:34:57.140
 Go back, do like I had to do.

1:34:57.140 --> 1:34:58.620
 I come very much from the left of the left,

1:34:58.620 --> 1:34:59.900
 if you can believe that.

1:34:59.900 --> 1:35:02.380
 But I had to have my own intellectual journey.

1:35:02.380 --> 1:35:04.260
 And in this case, my intellectual journey

1:35:04.260 --> 1:35:08.100
 was very much complimented by my own life.

1:35:08.100 --> 1:35:12.620
 Having to build these companies on two separate continents

1:35:12.620 --> 1:35:17.180
 and having to, I had front row seat of the differences.

1:35:17.180 --> 1:35:20.100
 At first, I thought it was this way just because we're poor

1:35:20.100 --> 1:35:22.700
 and therefore we must stop and therefore it's like this.

1:35:22.700 --> 1:35:24.380
 But eventually I learned that no,

1:35:24.380 --> 1:35:26.300
 we're poor because we lack academic freedom.

1:35:26.300 --> 1:35:28.100
 And if a country allows its citizens

1:35:28.100 --> 1:35:31.500
 the academic freedom to enterprise, then they become rich.

1:35:31.500 --> 1:35:33.540
 So yeah, I had it upside down, you see.

1:35:33.540 --> 1:35:35.380
 And so it's important for people to know that.

1:35:35.380 --> 1:35:38.260
 So number one, know your facts

1:35:38.260 --> 1:35:41.740
 because your facts will empower you.

1:35:41.740 --> 1:35:43.580
 In this case, I like to use that word,

1:35:43.580 --> 1:35:46.140
 facts will empower you and they will even furthermore,

1:35:46.140 --> 1:35:49.260
 they will power you, empower and power you.

1:35:49.260 --> 1:35:50.740
 Because empower is like inside

1:35:50.740 --> 1:35:53.780
 and power is like I push you forward and up.

1:35:53.780 --> 1:35:56.860
 So that's what it does to know the facts.

1:35:56.860 --> 1:36:00.380
 And then go on and look around you.

1:36:00.380 --> 1:36:02.540
 Where are the best practices of this?

1:36:02.540 --> 1:36:05.780
 Who is at the cutting edge of a free markets?

1:36:05.780 --> 1:36:07.340
 Where it's done in a way there,

1:36:08.460 --> 1:36:10.420
 people don't necessarily be left behind

1:36:10.420 --> 1:36:11.500
 or anything like that.

1:36:11.500 --> 1:36:13.740
 We're in 2022 for Christ's sake.

1:36:13.740 --> 1:36:15.860
 We don't have to do entrepreneurship

1:36:15.860 --> 1:36:17.860
 the same way maybe it was done 50 years ago,

1:36:17.860 --> 1:36:20.340
 100 years ago when as a community, as a people,

1:36:20.340 --> 1:36:23.220
 we were maybe less enlightened because of our times, right?

1:36:23.220 --> 1:36:26.380
 We can update this thing and move forward,

1:36:26.380 --> 1:36:29.580
 but update is definitely not build back,

1:36:29.580 --> 1:36:30.420
 what do they call it?

1:36:30.420 --> 1:36:33.420
 Build back new or whatever they're calling it at the WF,

1:36:33.420 --> 1:36:36.620
 whatever nonsense and stuff they're smoking over there.

1:36:36.620 --> 1:36:37.460
 It's not that.

1:36:37.460 --> 1:36:39.700
 There are some principles that are universal

1:36:39.700 --> 1:36:41.900
 and that stand the test of time.

1:36:41.900 --> 1:36:46.900
 Those we have to keep and on top add the new things

1:36:46.900 --> 1:36:49.380
 we learned from our times and from life.

1:36:49.380 --> 1:36:51.460
 So that's what I want them to know.

1:36:51.460 --> 1:36:54.780
 Learn your facts, be empowered and powered,

1:36:54.780 --> 1:36:57.060
 and then look around, think about it

1:36:57.060 --> 1:37:00.420
 and look to see where the best practices are

1:37:00.420 --> 1:37:02.500
 around the world because the world is yours.

1:37:02.500 --> 1:37:04.620
 You might be African, but the world is yours.

1:37:04.620 --> 1:37:06.860
 So stop this nonsense of, oh, well,

1:37:06.860 --> 1:37:09.060
 it's done by white people, so we're not gonna do it.

1:37:09.060 --> 1:37:12.860
 Get the best that exists in humanity

1:37:12.860 --> 1:37:15.020
 for what you're trying to solve.

1:37:15.020 --> 1:37:19.060
 And on top of that, put your own twist, right?

1:37:19.060 --> 1:37:22.340
 Bitcoin is all of ours to take.

1:37:22.340 --> 1:37:24.060
 Bitcoin is not the white man's thing,

1:37:24.060 --> 1:37:25.380
 so therefore, oh, come on, you know,

1:37:25.380 --> 1:37:27.100
 because we have a misguided pride,

1:37:27.100 --> 1:37:29.180
 we're not gonna use Bitcoin because it's white man's time.

1:37:29.180 --> 1:37:30.860
 Bitcoin is math, you idiot.

1:37:30.860 --> 1:37:34.140
 Math is universal, so it belongs to all of us.

1:37:34.140 --> 1:37:35.100
 There's no color.

1:37:35.100 --> 1:37:35.940
 Exactly.

1:37:35.940 --> 1:37:40.580
 In the space of economics, in the space of ideas.

1:37:40.580 --> 1:37:43.180
 And there's a chance to leapfrog too,

1:37:43.180 --> 1:37:44.740
 which is really, really powerful.

1:37:44.740 --> 1:37:47.540
 Exactly, because here we will leapfrog,

1:37:47.540 --> 1:37:50.700
 and let's, I'm not crazy, this is gonna happen.

1:37:50.700 --> 1:37:53.540
 You mark my words, but it's gonna happen

1:37:53.540 --> 1:37:56.660
 if as many people hear what we're talking about today,

1:37:56.660 --> 1:38:00.140
 because at some point, the solution is not gonna come.

1:38:00.140 --> 1:38:02.740
 It's not me, it's not,

1:38:02.740 --> 1:38:04.660
 it's gonna come from the wisdom of a crowd.

1:38:04.660 --> 1:38:06.860
 This is why I love the crowd.

1:38:06.860 --> 1:38:08.500
 There's no better wisdom than the crowd,

1:38:08.500 --> 1:38:10.500
 and that's also why I believe in the free markets.

1:38:10.500 --> 1:38:13.660
 This concept of emergent order, there's no way,

1:38:13.660 --> 1:38:16.460
 there's no central planning that is smart enough,

1:38:16.460 --> 1:38:20.380
 that has the level of intel that street level people have,

1:38:21.540 --> 1:38:22.820
 trying to create something.

1:38:22.820 --> 1:38:24.620
 It's just, we just have to be humble.

1:38:24.620 --> 1:38:27.420
 There's just something at the bottom of a pyramid

1:38:27.420 --> 1:38:29.660
 that just bubbles up and happens.

1:38:29.660 --> 1:38:31.300
 They're the best.

1:38:31.300 --> 1:38:34.540
 I think the cynicism, the idea that people are dumb

1:38:34.540 --> 1:38:37.820
 is at the core of a lot of things

1:38:37.820 --> 1:38:41.060
 that prevent the flourishing of society.

1:38:41.060 --> 1:38:42.340
 You know, this kind of anecdotally,

1:38:42.340 --> 1:38:44.260
 people are like, ah, everyone is stupid,

1:38:44.260 --> 1:38:45.940
 and people say that jokingly.

1:38:45.940 --> 1:38:49.540
 But the reality is, people are incredible.

1:38:49.540 --> 1:38:53.140
 They have the capacity for kindness, for love,

1:38:53.140 --> 1:38:57.500
 for innovation, for brilliance, in all kinds of dimensions.

1:38:57.500 --> 1:38:59.620
 You might suck at math,

1:38:59.620 --> 1:39:02.060
 but you might be amazing at carpentry.

1:39:02.060 --> 1:39:03.500
 You have to find that thing,

1:39:03.500 --> 1:39:05.380
 and there's something about,

1:39:05.380 --> 1:39:07.300
 when there's a freedom to find that thing,

1:39:07.300 --> 1:39:10.020
 and people interact, they get excited about shit together,

1:39:10.020 --> 1:39:11.980
 and then they build.

1:39:11.980 --> 1:39:14.740
 If you look at authoritarian,

1:39:14.740 --> 1:39:18.540
 at places that limit that freedom,

1:39:18.540 --> 1:39:22.340
 at the core, I think, is the idea that people are dumb.

1:39:22.340 --> 1:39:24.140
 Let us take care of everything.

1:39:24.140 --> 1:39:26.260
 We'll come up with the rules and the regulations,

1:39:26.260 --> 1:39:28.940
 because people are too dumb to manage things themselves.

1:39:28.940 --> 1:39:33.020
 And then that idea builds on top of itself,

1:39:33.020 --> 1:39:35.820
 where you think that the entire populace

1:39:35.820 --> 1:39:39.620
 is much lesser than the wise sages sitting at the top.

1:39:39.620 --> 1:39:41.220
 Then you add violence on top of that,

1:39:41.220 --> 1:39:43.620
 and that leads to corruption,

1:39:43.620 --> 1:39:46.340
 to corrupting of just the human mind of the leaders,

1:39:46.340 --> 1:39:49.780
 and the whole thing becomes a giant mess.

1:39:49.780 --> 1:39:54.500
 The antidote to that is economic freedom.

1:39:54.500 --> 1:39:56.420
 For people to have a freedom to enterprise.

1:39:56.420 --> 1:40:01.420
 And look, Lex, when we allow for that to happen,

1:40:01.540 --> 1:40:02.780
 have you looked around lately

1:40:02.780 --> 1:40:06.020
 and looked at the level of niche

1:40:06.020 --> 1:40:08.020
 that has happened in this country?

1:40:08.020 --> 1:40:11.380
 I mean, you have clubs where, you have places

1:40:11.380 --> 1:40:13.100
 where people are into guitar strings,

1:40:13.100 --> 1:40:14.140
 you know, like some of the,

1:40:14.140 --> 1:40:16.780
 like it's all about guitar strings.

1:40:16.780 --> 1:40:19.780
 And others, it's all about these best cupcakes.

1:40:19.780 --> 1:40:23.500
 And others, it's all about this new crypto thing over here.

1:40:23.500 --> 1:40:27.980
 And others, like hair, best, you know, weight.

1:40:27.980 --> 1:40:32.980
 It's, when you allow us, because seven billion geniuses,

1:40:34.060 --> 1:40:35.380
 each one of us, I believe,

1:40:35.380 --> 1:40:38.260
 came to this world with something,

1:40:38.260 --> 1:40:41.580
 something that only he or her possesses.

1:40:41.580 --> 1:40:43.060
 And that is the genius,

1:40:43.060 --> 1:40:47.340
 and it is their contribution to the human problem.

1:40:47.340 --> 1:40:49.460
 When you think about your identity today,

1:40:49.460 --> 1:40:52.020
 so it all started in Africa,

1:40:52.020 --> 1:40:55.260
 just like it did for the entirety of the human species.

1:40:55.260 --> 1:40:57.100
 There's a bit of European flavor in there,

1:40:57.100 --> 1:41:00.900
 a little French, Silicon Valley.

1:41:00.900 --> 1:41:05.100
 You're now, in part, a Texan.

1:41:05.100 --> 1:41:08.460
 There's, you really are an American,

1:41:08.460 --> 1:41:10.420
 but you're also an African.

1:41:11.540 --> 1:41:13.740
 Who are you, when you look in the mirror,

1:41:13.740 --> 1:41:15.020
 when you think about yourself,

1:41:15.020 --> 1:41:17.540
 when you listen, when everything gets quiet

1:41:17.540 --> 1:41:20.420
 and you listen to your heart, who are you?

1:41:20.420 --> 1:41:22.980
 Can you figure out that puzzle?

1:41:23.860 --> 1:41:25.140
 That's a very interesting question,

1:41:25.140 --> 1:41:30.140
 because it's been a long time I haven't asked myself.

1:41:30.140 --> 1:41:35.140
 I have before.

1:41:42.700 --> 1:41:44.340
 What I have found is,

1:41:47.460 --> 1:41:50.980
 I think who I am today has been, for sure,

1:41:50.980 --> 1:41:54.980
 shaped by, I call it Dakar, Paris, San Francisco.

1:41:54.980 --> 1:41:59.020
 Dakar is Senegal, Paris, France,

1:41:59.020 --> 1:42:01.020
 and San Francisco, primarily.

1:42:01.020 --> 1:42:02.700
 And now, yeah, I think I might want to ask,

1:42:02.700 --> 1:42:04.660
 there's a little bit of Texan in there.

1:42:04.660 --> 1:42:07.060
 How do you say Texas in French?

1:42:07.060 --> 1:42:07.900
 Texas.

1:42:07.900 --> 1:42:08.740
 Texas.

1:42:08.740 --> 1:42:09.580
 Texas.

1:42:09.580 --> 1:42:10.420
 Yeah.

1:42:10.420 --> 1:42:11.620
 Austin, Texas.

1:42:11.620 --> 1:42:12.540
 Austin, Texas.

1:42:12.540 --> 1:42:13.380
 Austin.

1:42:13.380 --> 1:42:14.220
 Austin, Texas.

1:42:14.220 --> 1:42:15.540
 It's easy.

1:42:15.540 --> 1:42:16.620
 Not quite as good as San Francisco.

1:42:16.620 --> 1:42:17.740
 Austin, Texas.

1:42:17.740 --> 1:42:18.700
 Yeah, yeah.

1:42:18.700 --> 1:42:19.820
 Us, Texas.

1:42:19.820 --> 1:42:20.660
 Us.

1:42:20.660 --> 1:42:22.140
 Texas, yeah.

1:42:22.140 --> 1:42:22.980
 So,

1:42:22.980 --> 1:42:27.980
 you, I was formed by those three.

1:42:30.260 --> 1:42:35.260
 I have to say that what I enjoy from my Senegalese roots

1:42:35.500 --> 1:42:40.500
 are our commitment to peace, love, and tolerance very much.

1:42:44.780 --> 1:42:46.300
 And Taranga, obviously.

1:42:48.220 --> 1:42:50.500
 And I like that it's a culture

1:42:50.500 --> 1:42:53.300
 that's very much about reverence.

1:42:53.300 --> 1:42:54.740
 It's, we're big on reverence.

1:42:56.420 --> 1:43:00.700
 I don't think you could ever hear me tell an older person,

1:43:00.700 --> 1:43:04.260
 especially not my parents or my grandma or anybody like that,

1:43:04.260 --> 1:43:08.540
 for us to be able to tell an older person that's not true

1:43:08.540 --> 1:43:11.500
 or you're lying would never cross my mind

1:43:11.500 --> 1:43:12.900
 because that's the most disrespectful thing

1:43:12.900 --> 1:43:13.740
 you can think of,

1:43:13.740 --> 1:43:15.780
 the most irreverent thing you can think of.

1:43:15.780 --> 1:43:17.100
 It doesn't mean that you have to agree

1:43:17.100 --> 1:43:19.260
 with everything that's said,

1:43:19.260 --> 1:43:21.860
 but there is a way to disagree.

1:43:21.860 --> 1:43:23.420
 There is a way to push back

1:43:23.420 --> 1:43:25.700
 that doesn't have to rob this person

1:43:25.700 --> 1:43:26.940
 who happens to be older than you,

1:43:26.940 --> 1:43:31.940
 especially from the dignity that older age normally provides.

1:43:31.980 --> 1:43:33.740
 And there's wisdom to their words

1:43:33.740 --> 1:43:36.300
 that you yourself may not see.

1:43:36.300 --> 1:43:40.340
 So the reverence is for the idea of wisdom, of tradition.

1:43:40.340 --> 1:43:42.580
 Exactly, exactly.

1:43:42.580 --> 1:43:46.980
 And again, so that is something that I really enjoy,

1:43:46.980 --> 1:43:49.060
 especially, and something I'm very attached to,

1:43:49.060 --> 1:43:52.900
 to this day, and then from France,

1:43:52.900 --> 1:43:56.580
 what I really came to enjoy, of course,

1:43:56.580 --> 1:44:00.300
 is all the fineness that one can find

1:44:00.300 --> 1:44:02.100
 within French culture.

1:44:02.100 --> 1:44:03.340
 The fineness?

1:44:03.340 --> 1:44:04.380
 Yeah, the fineness.

1:44:04.380 --> 1:44:05.700
 Foods.

1:44:05.700 --> 1:44:08.740
 You mean like the intricacies, like the very...

1:44:08.740 --> 1:44:11.620
 Yeah, the soft sophistication in there.

1:44:11.620 --> 1:44:14.100
 I mean, French lingerie, for example.

1:44:14.100 --> 1:44:18.060
 I mean, la dentelle, the laces, all of that,

1:44:18.060 --> 1:44:22.580
 it's super, it's exquisite.

1:44:22.580 --> 1:44:23.540
 So the...

1:44:23.540 --> 1:44:24.380
 The fashion, the food.

1:44:24.380 --> 1:44:26.020
 The fashion, the food.

1:44:26.020 --> 1:44:27.500
 I mean, there's something to be said about all of that,

1:44:27.500 --> 1:44:29.460
 and it's very beautiful.

1:44:29.460 --> 1:44:32.660
 And I love also, even when I talk about fineness,

1:44:32.660 --> 1:44:34.740
 it's like a meal is not about this big thing

1:44:34.740 --> 1:44:36.020
 they put in front of you,

1:44:36.020 --> 1:44:39.180
 but smaller portions, enjoy what you're eating

1:44:39.180 --> 1:44:40.220
 and spend time at a table.

1:44:40.220 --> 1:44:42.380
 Like the eating time is not necessarily

1:44:42.380 --> 1:44:44.260
 just this function of feeding yourself,

1:44:44.260 --> 1:44:46.460
 which I understand it,

1:44:46.460 --> 1:44:49.540
 but this is something that they share

1:44:49.540 --> 1:44:51.540
 with Senegalese culture,

1:44:51.540 --> 1:44:55.180
 is eating is a moment of communion.

1:44:55.180 --> 1:44:57.940
 It's a moment of friendship, family.

1:44:57.940 --> 1:45:00.580
 It's a precious moment.

1:45:00.580 --> 1:45:03.780
 To this day, and my husband is American,

1:45:03.780 --> 1:45:07.220
 we eat our meals together all the time.

1:45:07.220 --> 1:45:09.100
 I would not have it any other way.

1:45:09.100 --> 1:45:11.100
 And there's a prep time, all of that stuff.

1:45:11.100 --> 1:45:13.820
 It doesn't matter how busy I am, but we're doing it.

1:45:13.820 --> 1:45:15.500
 Actually, to push back a little bit,

1:45:15.500 --> 1:45:16.460
 it's interesting, because yeah,

1:45:16.460 --> 1:45:20.140
 the camaraderie over a meal is a beautiful thing.

1:45:20.140 --> 1:45:22.940
 I got, I mean, I was in a pretty dark place

1:45:22.940 --> 1:45:24.260
 because on the way to Ukraine,

1:45:24.260 --> 1:45:26.300
 I traveled to Paris, I stayed in Paris,

1:45:26.300 --> 1:45:30.500
 and I wasn't able to enjoy the fineness

1:45:31.740 --> 1:45:33.620
 because it was almost a distraction

1:45:33.620 --> 1:45:36.340
 from the humanity for some reason to me,

1:45:36.340 --> 1:45:39.140
 because there's such a focus on the art of it all

1:45:40.020 --> 1:45:42.540
 that you lose the basic connection to humanity.

1:45:42.540 --> 1:45:44.260
 Now, that said.

1:45:44.260 --> 1:45:45.620
 Depends what you're talking about.

1:45:45.620 --> 1:45:48.700
 I think some of the lack of connection over humanity

1:45:48.700 --> 1:45:51.700
 was the fact that while I did know how to speak French

1:45:51.700 --> 1:45:54.380
 for a long time, I forgot most of the language.

1:45:55.260 --> 1:45:58.100
 And so part of it, there is a barrier.

1:45:58.100 --> 1:45:59.540
 You said hospitality.

1:46:00.540 --> 1:46:03.340
 There is a bit of a barrier in French culture

1:46:03.340 --> 1:46:05.900
 to where in order to be welcomed in,

1:46:05.900 --> 1:46:09.380
 you have to hear the music

1:46:09.380 --> 1:46:12.220
 and be able to play the music of the people.

1:46:12.220 --> 1:46:16.380
 And if you don't, there's a bit of a barrier.

1:46:16.380 --> 1:46:18.940
 I must admit on that end that it is true.

1:46:19.780 --> 1:46:21.580
 You would feel less that

1:46:21.580 --> 1:46:24.060
 if you were with a group of Senegalese people per se,

1:46:24.060 --> 1:46:27.460
 or I would even say if a group of Spanish people.

1:46:28.380 --> 1:46:31.060
 And I think this is maybe the other side

1:46:31.060 --> 1:46:32.580
 of it for the French people.

1:46:32.580 --> 1:46:35.140
 They can be a little bit uppity up there.

1:46:35.140 --> 1:46:38.340
 And I think maybe that's what you're sensing there.

1:46:38.340 --> 1:46:40.260
 If you don't have the codes,

1:46:40.260 --> 1:46:42.860
 which is what you call if you don't sing the music,

1:46:42.860 --> 1:46:45.420
 then it's hard for you to be part of it.

1:46:45.420 --> 1:46:48.580
 But I was speaking here from the standpoint of your inn.

1:46:48.580 --> 1:46:51.020
 Yeah, from the inside.

1:46:51.020 --> 1:46:54.940
 Also, come on, coming from Texas and also Ukraine,

1:46:54.940 --> 1:46:58.500
 Ukraine, I should say some of the best steak and meat

1:46:58.500 --> 1:47:00.580
 I've ever had, cheap.

1:47:01.660 --> 1:47:03.140
 Texas, some of the greatest.

1:47:03.140 --> 1:47:06.940
 And the size of the meals in France,

1:47:06.940 --> 1:47:08.500
 it's like, what are we doing here?

1:47:08.500 --> 1:47:11.820
 I mean, I get it's art.

1:47:11.820 --> 1:47:14.580
 I'd like to look at my art on the wall

1:47:14.580 --> 1:47:16.540
 and then eat my damn steak.

1:47:16.540 --> 1:47:17.380
 I just wanna cut the shit.

1:47:17.380 --> 1:47:18.980
 Did you go, so maybe, okay, no, no, no, no.

1:47:18.980 --> 1:47:20.300
 Okay, now here I have to defend them,

1:47:20.300 --> 1:47:22.060
 although sometimes I'm the worst.

1:47:22.060 --> 1:47:25.420
 Now, did you go to some Michelin star restaurant?

1:47:25.420 --> 1:47:26.260
 Maybe that's why.

1:47:26.260 --> 1:47:27.100
 Yeah, a little bit, a little bit.

1:47:27.100 --> 1:47:29.580
 That's why, because next time you go to France,

1:47:29.580 --> 1:47:34.580
 I'll take you to the countryside or any French home.

1:47:35.740 --> 1:47:38.020
 They will serve you multiple times.

1:47:38.020 --> 1:47:41.260
 I mean, by the time you're done,

1:47:41.260 --> 1:47:43.220
 even if the portions are smaller,

1:47:43.220 --> 1:47:44.060
 they're smaller if you want to,

1:47:44.060 --> 1:47:45.860
 but because that way you get a chance

1:47:45.860 --> 1:47:48.620
 to really feel what you're eating and then have more

1:47:48.620 --> 1:47:50.620
 and then all of that stuff, but not be like, ah, like this.

1:47:50.620 --> 1:47:52.900
 And then, but no, you'll eat plenty,

1:47:52.900 --> 1:47:54.980
 but it's because you went to the Michelin places

1:47:54.980 --> 1:47:55.820
 where they were like.

1:47:55.820 --> 1:47:58.100
 I'm sure the warmth of the people is there.

1:47:58.100 --> 1:48:00.580
 It almost makes me sad that sometimes,

1:48:00.580 --> 1:48:02.460
 I think to properly be in a place,

1:48:02.460 --> 1:48:05.060
 you really should spend a long time there.

1:48:05.060 --> 1:48:06.620
 And also be emotionally ready.

1:48:06.620 --> 1:48:09.340
 Again, I was emotionally unavailable.

1:48:09.340 --> 1:48:10.180
 I was just like.

1:48:10.180 --> 1:48:11.380
 Well, I would imagine on the way to the Ukraine,

1:48:11.380 --> 1:48:13.180
 I'm like, who can think about food?

1:48:13.180 --> 1:48:16.180
 But in your identity, a bit of Texas,

1:48:16.180 --> 1:48:18.860
 a bit of San Francisco, a bit of Africa.

1:48:18.860 --> 1:48:20.540
 Yeah, San Francisco.

1:48:20.540 --> 1:48:23.620
 And I guess from the America,

1:48:23.620 --> 1:48:27.980
 the defining thing for me for America is,

1:48:27.980 --> 1:48:32.980
 it's the freedom and the entrepreneurial mindset.

1:48:33.100 --> 1:48:35.860
 See, very quickly when I moved from France

1:48:35.860 --> 1:48:37.420
 to the United States,

1:48:37.420 --> 1:48:40.540
 and I started becoming successful in the United States,

1:48:40.540 --> 1:48:42.460
 I found myself, me and my husband,

1:48:42.460 --> 1:48:45.860
 he was French and my first husband who passed away.

1:48:45.860 --> 1:48:47.180
 We found ourselves at some point,

1:48:47.180 --> 1:48:50.500
 we stopped talking to our friends in France

1:48:50.500 --> 1:48:52.260
 who stayed in France,

1:48:53.420 --> 1:48:55.820
 because we were talking to them about things

1:48:55.820 --> 1:49:00.340
 that were so outside of their comprehension.

1:49:00.340 --> 1:49:04.260
 What do you mean you're in your twenties

1:49:04.260 --> 1:49:09.260
 and you just raised, I don't know,

1:49:09.260 --> 1:49:10.700
 a million dollars or $2 million,

1:49:10.700 --> 1:49:11.860
 especially from back in those days.

1:49:11.860 --> 1:49:13.500
 Today, it's easy here and there.

1:49:13.500 --> 1:49:14.540
 So even in France,

1:49:14.540 --> 1:49:16.740
 that entrepreneurial spirit didn't burn quite as bright.

1:49:16.740 --> 1:49:19.540
 I mean, don't take me wrong.

1:49:19.540 --> 1:49:21.500
 Do you have some entrepreneurial people in France?

1:49:21.500 --> 1:49:23.820
 Yeah, but to the level that you have it in the US,

1:49:23.820 --> 1:49:24.940
 absolutely not.

1:49:24.940 --> 1:49:28.060
 It's just, I mean, in France, it's still very much,

1:49:28.060 --> 1:49:29.540
 you're born in this area,

1:49:29.540 --> 1:49:30.980
 you go to school in that area,

1:49:30.980 --> 1:49:32.220
 your parents live around,

1:49:32.220 --> 1:49:35.020
 eventually you'll marry and be where your parents are

1:49:35.020 --> 1:49:38.220
 or maybe go to where your spouse's parents are

1:49:38.220 --> 1:49:40.660
 and you buy your house and you buy it once

1:49:40.660 --> 1:49:42.580
 and you're not gonna do like the Americans,

1:49:42.580 --> 1:49:44.700
 two years later, I sell my house, I go somewhere else.

1:49:44.700 --> 1:49:45.940
 You don't have any of anything.

1:49:45.940 --> 1:49:48.940
 What do you mean, just stopping from nowhere,

1:49:48.940 --> 1:49:50.340
 you're gonna do what?

1:49:50.340 --> 1:49:52.620
 Start a business and you have nothing to back you up

1:49:52.620 --> 1:49:53.460
 or whatever.

1:49:53.460 --> 1:49:57.740
 Oh, and even this idea of going and fundraising,

1:49:57.740 --> 1:49:59.700
 this venture cap, especially back in the days,

1:49:59.700 --> 1:50:02.020
 venture cap, all of that, it's very American.

1:50:02.020 --> 1:50:03.540
 We take it for granted, but it's very American.

1:50:03.540 --> 1:50:06.420
 Who would have made a bet on me in France?

1:50:06.420 --> 1:50:07.620
 The same person.

1:50:07.620 --> 1:50:09.460
 I would not have found the same people.

1:50:09.460 --> 1:50:13.740
 I would never in France have been able to raise,

1:50:13.740 --> 1:50:16.020
 at some point it was $32 million for my first business,

1:50:16.020 --> 1:50:18.420
 never would have been able to do that in France.

1:50:18.420 --> 1:50:19.900
 And it doesn't mean that French people are bad people

1:50:19.900 --> 1:50:20.740
 or anything like that.

1:50:20.740 --> 1:50:24.540
 It's just something that's just not so in the culture.

1:50:24.540 --> 1:50:27.100
 Just like this whole concept of philanthropy,

1:50:27.100 --> 1:50:29.180
 it's not that the French people don't do philanthropy,

1:50:29.180 --> 1:50:31.620
 but philanthropy in America is very different

1:50:31.620 --> 1:50:34.260
 from the level and also the magnitude

1:50:34.260 --> 1:50:35.900
 of maybe what the French people do.

1:50:35.900 --> 1:50:37.940
 And also they have this always like,

1:50:37.940 --> 1:50:39.660
 oh, let's do it behind the scene.

1:50:39.660 --> 1:50:42.420
 Money is suspicious, success is suspicious.

1:50:42.420 --> 1:50:44.500
 So at some point my husband and I just felt like

1:50:44.500 --> 1:50:46.020
 our friends actually were maybe thinking

1:50:46.020 --> 1:50:47.860
 that we're maybe some drug dealers or something.

1:50:47.860 --> 1:50:51.020
 So we just stopped because it just was not flowing anymore.

1:50:51.020 --> 1:50:56.020
 And so yes, in America I found this entrepreneurial spirit,

1:50:56.020 --> 1:50:59.020
 but then I was able to link it with something

1:50:59.020 --> 1:51:01.220
 that I'm very familiar with in my country.

1:51:01.220 --> 1:51:04.700
 See, back home in Senegal, I'm part of this,

1:51:04.700 --> 1:51:07.020
 you have what we call the Mourid, I'm a Mourid.

1:51:07.020 --> 1:51:11.060
 So what it is is one of the four brotherhoods in Senegal,

1:51:11.060 --> 1:51:13.380
 Mouridism is the most influential of them

1:51:13.380 --> 1:51:14.580
 and the biggest one.

1:51:14.580 --> 1:51:17.900
 And us, it's all about entrepreneurship as well.

1:51:17.900 --> 1:51:21.020
 I mean, of course there's the whole religious part,

1:51:21.020 --> 1:51:23.700
 but our mantra is,

1:51:23.700 --> 1:51:26.020
 pray as if you will die tomorrow

1:51:26.020 --> 1:51:28.180
 and work as if you will never die.

1:51:28.180 --> 1:51:29.780
 And the way we say,

1:51:29.780 --> 1:51:32.300
 the way somebody will say that somebody passed away,

1:51:32.300 --> 1:51:34.940
 we say, somebody has retired.

1:51:34.940 --> 1:51:36.940
 Somebody has retired from their work.

1:51:36.940 --> 1:51:37.780
 Right?

1:51:37.780 --> 1:51:38.620
 Beautiful.

1:51:38.620 --> 1:51:39.460
 Right?

1:51:39.460 --> 1:51:44.460
 So, I think it's funny because in that community,

1:51:44.620 --> 1:51:46.860
 we're very much entrepreneurial,

1:51:46.860 --> 1:51:50.220
 left to our own devices, we're entrepreneurial.

1:51:50.220 --> 1:51:52.620
 But then what happens is the minute that we die,

1:51:52.620 --> 1:51:55.500
 then what happens is the minute people start going to,

1:51:55.500 --> 1:51:57.860
 they're being educated through the education system,

1:51:57.860 --> 1:51:59.900
 you know, like the French, especially the system,

1:51:59.900 --> 1:52:01.700
 but tend to breed more like, you know,

1:52:01.700 --> 1:52:03.380
 the French bureaucrat mindset,

1:52:03.380 --> 1:52:05.580
 then you can see all the entrepreneurial mindset

1:52:05.580 --> 1:52:07.940
 kind of starting to dwindle down.

1:52:07.940 --> 1:52:09.460
 So it's kind of very interesting.

1:52:09.460 --> 1:52:13.060
 So in a way, America helped me reunite

1:52:13.060 --> 1:52:15.260
 with that side of my roots,

1:52:15.260 --> 1:52:20.260
 where America tells me, reinforces that side of my roots

1:52:20.260 --> 1:52:22.940
 and also gives me more tools to practice

1:52:22.940 --> 1:52:25.820
 that side of my roots, if that makes any sense.

1:52:25.820 --> 1:52:29.060
 Through all of that, that's what brings out

1:52:29.060 --> 1:52:31.460
 the heart of a cheetah, which I think is a beautiful,

1:52:31.460 --> 1:52:36.460
 beautiful thing that encapsulates that whole trajectory,

1:52:36.580 --> 1:52:38.820
 which I think is the best possible answer

1:52:38.820 --> 1:52:39.780
 anyone could give.

1:52:39.780 --> 1:52:44.180
 It makes me want to really think about who I am,

1:52:44.180 --> 1:52:47.100
 because you really have brought together

1:52:47.100 --> 1:52:49.220
 so many cultures within yourself

1:52:49.220 --> 1:52:52.220
 that just talking to you makes you feel like

1:52:52.220 --> 1:52:54.260
 we are just all one people.

1:52:54.260 --> 1:52:56.660
 Because at the end we are, at the end we are.

1:52:58.220 --> 1:53:00.660
 And, you know, when you come from,

1:53:00.660 --> 1:53:03.420
 at the end we are, and also I think for me,

1:53:03.420 --> 1:53:05.500
 if people can take anything from my story,

1:53:05.500 --> 1:53:07.700
 it's at the end of the day, I am very clear about it.

1:53:07.700 --> 1:53:11.260
 And I'm all for harmony among people

1:53:11.260 --> 1:53:13.820
 and among us peoples.

1:53:13.820 --> 1:53:18.820
 If we can accept that we're all,

1:53:20.020 --> 1:53:23.300
 I know this sounds so cliche, but for me it's so true,

1:53:23.300 --> 1:53:24.860
 that we're all humans.

1:53:24.860 --> 1:53:27.660
 You know, when I left Senegal,

1:53:27.660 --> 1:53:30.060
 when I was about to leave Senegal for the first time

1:53:30.060 --> 1:53:33.340
 and to go to Europe to be reunited with my parents,

1:53:33.340 --> 1:53:35.500
 because now they had emigrated

1:53:35.500 --> 1:53:37.500
 and things were going to be fine.

1:53:37.500 --> 1:53:40.900
 And I was going to be, things were stable for them.

1:53:40.900 --> 1:53:43.780
 Now they're like, it's time to be reunited with her.

1:53:43.780 --> 1:53:46.300
 They brought me over, but before I left Senegal,

1:53:46.300 --> 1:53:47.780
 my grandma sat me down.

1:53:47.780 --> 1:53:50.180
 She actually, she lowered herself down to my level

1:53:50.180 --> 1:53:54.060
 and she said, my god, you're about to go to this place

1:53:54.060 --> 1:53:56.060
 where most people will not look like you.

1:53:57.980 --> 1:53:59.900
 And most people speak a language

1:53:59.900 --> 1:54:02.220
 that's going to be different from yours.

1:54:02.220 --> 1:54:03.580
 And you're going to realize that all the kids

1:54:03.580 --> 1:54:05.740
 are going to school and you've never been to school

1:54:05.740 --> 1:54:07.660
 because, you know, I was, like I said, a free range kid

1:54:07.660 --> 1:54:09.660
 and I was just living my life.

1:54:09.660 --> 1:54:13.700
 And she said, but I don't want for any of that,

1:54:13.700 --> 1:54:14.820
 and she showed her words, she said,

1:54:14.820 --> 1:54:18.420
 I don't want for any of that to intimidate you.

1:54:18.420 --> 1:54:21.340
 She said, you can be impressed by some of it if you want,

1:54:21.340 --> 1:54:23.260
 but no intimidation.

1:54:23.260 --> 1:54:24.980
 And she said, because the fact

1:54:24.980 --> 1:54:26.020
 that they might be different from you,

1:54:26.020 --> 1:54:28.060
 yeah, they're going to have a different skin color from you,

1:54:28.060 --> 1:54:30.940
 but it is still human skin.

1:54:30.940 --> 1:54:32.860
 You're human, they're human.

1:54:32.860 --> 1:54:35.300
 And she said, this language you're going to speak,

1:54:35.300 --> 1:54:37.420
 it's a different language from yours,

1:54:37.420 --> 1:54:41.020
 but it is still a language that humans speak.

1:54:41.020 --> 1:54:42.340
 You're human, they're human.

1:54:42.340 --> 1:54:44.660
 Therefore, you're going to speak it.

1:54:44.660 --> 1:54:47.540
 And lastly, they have gone to school.

1:54:47.540 --> 1:54:49.620
 Going to school is what little humans do.

1:54:49.620 --> 1:54:52.740
 You're a little human, so you'll be just fine.

1:54:52.740 --> 1:54:54.860
 And I went and grandma was right.

1:54:54.860 --> 1:54:56.540
 Right, she was right.

1:54:56.540 --> 1:54:58.500
 And that helped me.

1:54:58.500 --> 1:55:03.220
 And I think when you internalize that so early on,

1:55:05.260 --> 1:55:07.220
 it just makes you belong to the human family

1:55:07.220 --> 1:55:08.220
 that you're part of.

1:55:08.220 --> 1:55:10.260
 I am part of a human family.

1:55:10.260 --> 1:55:12.860
 And I would have no problem going to Russia, for example,

1:55:12.860 --> 1:55:16.260
 let's take, and be totally open.

1:55:16.260 --> 1:55:17.620
 Maybe don't go right now, but.

1:55:17.620 --> 1:55:18.460
 No, not now.

1:55:18.460 --> 1:55:19.460
 Maybe not now, you're right.

1:55:19.460 --> 1:55:20.300
 But what I just.

1:55:20.300 --> 1:55:22.820
 Or at least don't bring weed if you go on the plane.

1:55:22.820 --> 1:55:25.820
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, right.

1:55:25.820 --> 1:55:28.500
 That girl, I don't know what she was thinking, but.

1:55:28.500 --> 1:55:30.900
 No, so, but what I'm trying to say, Lex,

1:55:30.900 --> 1:55:34.260
 is I feel like I can go anywhere in the world,

1:55:34.260 --> 1:55:38.380
 including some of the most unfriendly places in the world

1:55:38.380 --> 1:55:41.460
 to someone like me, because there are places like that.

1:55:41.460 --> 1:55:46.460
 And yet I know, I know that somehow, somewhere,

1:55:47.260 --> 1:55:48.860
 someone will take care of me.

1:55:48.860 --> 1:55:50.460
 Someone will help me.

1:55:50.460 --> 1:55:52.100
 When I first came to this country,

1:55:54.980 --> 1:55:59.980
 I came as a tourist, but you had this amazing family

1:56:00.420 --> 1:56:03.940
 who had a business, a family business in Indiana,

1:56:03.940 --> 1:56:08.700
 Columbus, Indiana, the Wences, Carolyn Eldon Wence,

1:56:08.700 --> 1:56:10.700
 I owe them everything that I have in this country,

1:56:10.700 --> 1:56:12.380
 that I am in this country.

1:56:12.380 --> 1:56:17.380
 They are Americans in the mid America

1:56:17.420 --> 1:56:19.340
 from a place that most other Americans

1:56:19.340 --> 1:56:22.020
 would maybe look down on because,

1:56:22.020 --> 1:56:23.620
 and some people would be like, oh, you're going to this place

1:56:23.620 --> 1:56:26.460
 where they have more churches and cows than people,

1:56:26.460 --> 1:56:30.820
 that type of behavior, because the elite coastal elites,

1:56:30.820 --> 1:56:35.820
 but it is in Midwest, in the Midwest that I found,

1:56:35.900 --> 1:56:40.900
 that I, black young women coming out of nowhere,

1:56:41.300 --> 1:56:43.100
 found support.

1:56:43.100 --> 1:56:44.540
 They all rallied around me.

1:56:44.540 --> 1:56:47.420
 I didn't even come from the same faith as they are from,

1:56:47.420 --> 1:56:49.860
 yet their whole church rallied around me

1:56:49.860 --> 1:56:52.580
 to find me an apartment.

1:56:52.580 --> 1:56:55.540
 My host family found me, got me a job,

1:56:55.540 --> 1:56:57.500
 and it was not a pity job.

1:56:57.500 --> 1:56:59.980
 They were like, we need, we are in serious needs

1:56:59.980 --> 1:57:02.260
 of getting our accounting under control

1:57:02.260 --> 1:57:03.460
 and our marketing and all of that.

1:57:03.460 --> 1:57:07.380
 And I had to catch up years of accounting like to the cent

1:57:07.380 --> 1:57:09.940
 and come up with marketing, all of that.

1:57:09.940 --> 1:57:11.660
 And I did it way faster than they thought

1:57:11.660 --> 1:57:13.100
 I would ever be able to do that.

1:57:13.100 --> 1:57:14.460
 At some point they look at me and they're like,

1:57:14.460 --> 1:57:17.260
 look, there is a future for you.

1:57:17.260 --> 1:57:19.780
 And we are too small for that future.

1:57:19.780 --> 1:57:23.220
 And now we could be selfish and keep you here with us.

1:57:23.220 --> 1:57:25.540
 And we would want nothing more than that

1:57:25.540 --> 1:57:27.540
 because really they're like my parents to this day.

1:57:27.540 --> 1:57:29.180
 I just came back from seeing them.

1:57:29.180 --> 1:57:32.260
 And they said, but there's so much more for you

1:57:32.260 --> 1:57:33.620
 and we don't have it.

1:57:33.620 --> 1:57:36.140
 So we want you to go and find out what it is.

1:57:36.140 --> 1:57:37.940
 And that's eventually when I,

1:57:37.940 --> 1:57:41.180
 because something was brewing up in San Francisco

1:57:41.180 --> 1:57:43.500
 when I say I left my heart in San Francisco

1:57:43.500 --> 1:57:47.340
 because the man who would become my husband,

1:57:47.340 --> 1:57:48.820
 we went to the same business school in France,

1:57:48.820 --> 1:57:50.180
 but then he was older than me.

1:57:50.180 --> 1:57:53.380
 So he had come to San Francisco and started a business there.

1:57:53.380 --> 1:57:55.140
 And it just looked like there was something there.

1:57:55.140 --> 1:57:57.220
 And Scarola was like, you gotta go to San Francisco

1:57:57.220 --> 1:57:59.180
 and find out with Emmanuel what's going on.

1:57:59.180 --> 1:58:00.580
 So I went and I left my heart in San Francisco.

1:58:00.580 --> 1:58:02.460
 I came back and I'm like, okay, I'm leaving.

1:58:02.460 --> 1:58:03.700
 Here's the keys to my apartment.

1:58:03.700 --> 1:58:04.900
 What, I don't understand.

1:58:04.900 --> 1:58:06.660
 But I'm like, I'm out of here.

1:58:06.660 --> 1:58:08.940
 So no, but Carol, so this is it.

1:58:08.940 --> 1:58:11.180
 This is what I'm saying, especially in these times

1:58:11.180 --> 1:58:13.420
 when this country loves to dwell on,

1:58:14.820 --> 1:58:16.620
 you're bad because you have this skin color.

1:58:16.620 --> 1:58:18.540
 Here are people with a completely different skin color

1:58:18.540 --> 1:58:20.820
 than mine, completely different faith than mine,

1:58:20.820 --> 1:58:25.820
 yet embraced me, protected me, paid for my visa,

1:58:25.820 --> 1:58:29.820
 you know, for my lawyer, for my H1B, everything,

1:58:29.820 --> 1:58:33.660
 and also played emotional support for me.

1:58:33.660 --> 1:58:36.580
 And no one, no one asked them to do that.

1:58:36.580 --> 1:58:38.020
 They didn't have to do it.

1:58:38.020 --> 1:58:38.860
 They didn't.

1:58:38.860 --> 1:58:39.700
 So what I'm saying is,

1:58:39.700 --> 1:58:41.780
 and this has been the story of my life,

1:58:41.780 --> 1:58:45.060
 everywhere I go, regardless of the hostility around me,

1:58:46.100 --> 1:58:48.180
 you betcha that there's always,

1:58:48.180 --> 1:58:51.300
 always gonna be somebody who shows up for you.

1:58:51.300 --> 1:58:53.540
 And somebody who's at the extremes,

1:58:53.540 --> 1:58:56.820
 at the antipodes of where you are and who you are.

1:58:56.820 --> 1:58:58.220
 And that tells me something.

1:58:59.300 --> 1:59:01.020
 In the end, we are good people.

1:59:01.020 --> 1:59:02.620
 Most people are good people.

1:59:02.620 --> 1:59:04.620
 And there's so much power to that,

1:59:05.500 --> 1:59:10.500
 the internalizing of this idea that we're all just human

1:59:10.620 --> 1:59:13.100
 and there's human kindness all around us.

1:59:13.100 --> 1:59:17.780
 I've seen it a lot where people internalize that

1:59:17.780 --> 1:59:21.420
 and they're able to walk lightly amidst hate

1:59:21.420 --> 1:59:26.420
 and walk past it and it doesn't stick to them

1:59:29.020 --> 1:59:33.060
 in a way that they build resentment and it paralyzes them.

1:59:33.060 --> 1:59:35.940
 If they internalize the world as human,

1:59:35.940 --> 1:59:37.820
 they can be in the, just like you said,

1:59:37.820 --> 1:59:40.620
 in the worst places in the world for them.

1:59:40.620 --> 1:59:44.420
 And someone, somewhere that human magic and touch is there.

1:59:44.420 --> 1:59:46.820
 Yeah, it will find them.

1:59:46.820 --> 1:59:48.460
 It will find, yeah, yeah.

1:59:48.460 --> 1:59:50.300
 And you know, the other thing too, Lex is,

1:59:50.300 --> 1:59:53.060
 especially in these times we're walking in,

1:59:53.060 --> 1:59:55.620
 it is to remind yourself,

1:59:55.620 --> 1:59:58.300
 I think this is where we all are called

1:59:58.300 --> 2:00:01.300
 to practice more courage.

2:00:01.300 --> 2:00:03.260
 I call it courage.

2:00:03.260 --> 2:00:07.140
 It's the courage to show up with curiosity,

2:00:07.140 --> 2:00:09.300
 with empathy and with love.

2:00:09.300 --> 2:00:13.500
 To me, those three are the antidote to pretty much anything.

2:00:13.500 --> 2:00:14.780
 Curiosity and love.

2:00:14.780 --> 2:00:19.700
 In the face of fear, can you show up with curiosity?

2:00:19.700 --> 2:00:22.940
 In the face of hate, can you say,

2:00:22.940 --> 2:00:25.460
 I'm gonna engage with love?

2:00:25.460 --> 2:00:26.620
 Even if I'm scared to death

2:00:26.620 --> 2:00:29.380
 and even if I'm pissed off to death by this,

2:00:29.380 --> 2:00:30.700
 but can you do that?

2:00:30.700 --> 2:00:35.060
 In the face of just like, you know, judgment or whatever,

2:00:35.060 --> 2:00:36.820
 can you show up with empathy?

2:00:36.820 --> 2:00:40.940
 And I had just found that when you try to do that,

2:00:40.940 --> 2:00:44.100
 you engage very different parts of your brain.

2:00:44.100 --> 2:00:46.580
 That's proven by the way, by the brain scientists,

2:00:46.580 --> 2:00:48.860
 but you also can feel it in your body

2:00:48.860 --> 2:00:51.420
 that you're engaging very different parts of your soul.

2:00:51.420 --> 2:00:54.980
 And so I try myself, I'm not always good at it,

2:00:54.980 --> 2:00:57.700
 but it's a practice that I try to honor,

2:00:57.700 --> 2:00:59.700
 which is curiosity, empathy and love.

2:00:59.700 --> 2:01:01.780
 As I told you offline,

2:01:01.780 --> 2:01:04.620
 those, I agree with you 100% on that,

2:01:04.620 --> 2:01:07.900
 but there is, you know, when you go to Ukraine

2:01:07.900 --> 2:01:12.500
 and you can say, you can speak about the power of love,

2:01:12.500 --> 2:01:16.260
 but when you lose your family, when you lose your home,

2:01:16.260 --> 2:01:18.060
 all you have in your heart is hate.

2:01:18.060 --> 2:01:21.540
 Even if you know it, you're not supposed to have it.

2:01:21.540 --> 2:01:22.940
 You still, all you have is hate.

2:01:22.940 --> 2:01:27.940
 So sometimes it's a very human thing

2:01:27.940 --> 2:01:30.500
 to have resentment, to have hate.

2:01:30.500 --> 2:01:33.820
 But it is about trying not to stay there.

2:01:33.820 --> 2:01:36.460
 And it's okay if it takes you years,

2:01:36.460 --> 2:01:40.340
 but it is about trying, and I mean the word trying,

2:01:40.340 --> 2:01:42.820
 it is about trying not to stay there.

2:01:44.460 --> 2:01:45.780
 Let me ask you about some of the things

2:01:45.780 --> 2:01:48.700
 you see in this country from your perspective

2:01:48.700 --> 2:01:50.660
 of everywhere you've been in the world.

2:01:50.660 --> 2:01:53.860
 What do you think about the Black Lives Matter movement

2:01:53.860 --> 2:01:57.260
 here in America that does struggle

2:01:58.580 --> 2:02:03.580
 with the role of skin color today

2:02:04.580 --> 2:02:07.820
 and throughout the history of this country,

2:02:07.820 --> 2:02:10.340
 maybe even throughout the history of the world?

2:02:10.340 --> 2:02:14.740
 Well, Black Lives Matter has been a very hard one for me,

2:02:14.740 --> 2:02:16.780
 because do Black Lives Matter,

2:02:16.780 --> 2:02:18.620
 those three words together in that order,

2:02:18.620 --> 2:02:21.580
 what they mean, they mean everything,

2:02:21.580 --> 2:02:23.580
 because Black Lives do matter,

2:02:23.580 --> 2:02:25.900
 as any other lives do matter.

2:02:25.900 --> 2:02:28.340
 But I know in this case why they say Black Lives Matter,

2:02:28.340 --> 2:02:31.100
 because some of the context we have had.

2:02:31.100 --> 2:02:34.660
 Now, while I agree with the principles

2:02:34.660 --> 2:02:36.100
 that Black Lives Matter,

2:02:36.100 --> 2:02:39.340
 I have a big problem with the organization.

2:02:39.340 --> 2:02:43.060
 With the organization and what it stands for.

2:02:44.860 --> 2:02:47.580
 When I have an organization that pretends

2:02:47.580 --> 2:02:51.220
 to want to stand for Black lives to matter,

2:02:51.220 --> 2:02:56.220
 yet you are self proclaimed Marxist socialists,

2:02:58.740 --> 2:02:59.580
 I pause.

2:03:00.700 --> 2:03:01.620
 Why?

2:03:01.620 --> 2:03:04.180
 I pause and then I'm like, have we learned nothing?

2:03:05.580 --> 2:03:07.860
 Have we learned nothing?

2:03:07.860 --> 2:03:09.980
 And the reason why I say that, Lex,

2:03:09.980 --> 2:03:13.460
 is because 60 some years ago,

2:03:15.740 --> 2:03:18.340
 it started before even 60 some years ago,

2:03:22.980 --> 2:03:24.820
 Black people, in this case,

2:03:24.820 --> 2:03:27.100
 I'm talking about the African people,

2:03:28.380 --> 2:03:32.740
 I'm talking about the Black Africans

2:03:32.740 --> 2:03:37.180
 who would go on to really cement

2:03:37.180 --> 2:03:41.340
 this concept of African emancipation

2:03:41.340 --> 2:03:43.220
 and African liberation.

2:03:43.220 --> 2:03:46.380
 And here I'm taking us back to 1945.

2:03:46.380 --> 2:03:49.180
 They had four of them before that.

2:03:49.180 --> 2:03:53.300
 But in 1945, in Manchester, UK,

2:03:54.340 --> 2:03:56.380
 happened something that would become major

2:03:56.380 --> 2:04:00.100
 for Africa and its future,

2:04:00.100 --> 2:04:01.820
 especially subterranean Africa.

2:04:02.900 --> 2:04:04.860
 In Manchester, UK,

2:04:04.860 --> 2:04:07.780
 people like Blaise Diagne of my country,

2:04:08.740 --> 2:04:13.740
 Nyerere, Tanzania, Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana,

2:04:14.620 --> 2:04:19.060
 and others and others from different parts of the continent

2:04:19.060 --> 2:04:24.060
 got together with Marcus Garvey and W.E.B. Dubois.

2:04:25.580 --> 2:04:27.860
 And I say Dubois because that's how we say it in French.

2:04:27.860 --> 2:04:30.780
 He has a French name, French sounding name at least.

2:04:30.780 --> 2:04:33.620
 And Americans would say, so for Americans listening,

2:04:33.620 --> 2:04:36.940
 I know you say Duboy, but it's Dubois.

2:04:36.940 --> 2:04:38.060
 No, because just in case they're like,

2:04:38.060 --> 2:04:39.140
 who is he talking about?

2:04:39.140 --> 2:04:40.340
 That's who I'm talking about.

2:04:40.340 --> 2:04:44.340
 So all of those people got together in the UK

2:04:45.460 --> 2:04:50.140
 and with W.E.B. Dubois and Marcus Garvey,

2:04:50.140 --> 2:04:53.780
 big top African American intellectuals of their times.

2:04:55.780 --> 2:04:58.620
 W.E.B. Dubois had so many things happen to him,

2:04:58.620 --> 2:04:59.740
 starting from the North,

2:04:59.740 --> 2:05:01.740
 being more or more or less a liberal type guy.

2:05:01.740 --> 2:05:06.740
 You know, came to the South just to see at this time,

2:05:06.780 --> 2:05:08.980
 you know, people, black people being lynched

2:05:08.980 --> 2:05:13.220
 and some of the body parts been shown in store windows.

2:05:13.220 --> 2:05:17.420
 I mean, just for a second, we put ourselves in his shoes.

2:05:17.420 --> 2:05:19.820
 I put myself in his shoes.

2:05:19.820 --> 2:05:22.500
 And that's when he started to become radicalized, right?

2:05:22.500 --> 2:05:24.140
 Because at first it was like, oh, reforms,

2:05:24.140 --> 2:05:25.460
 and I was like, God darn it.

2:05:25.460 --> 2:05:27.100
 And I mean, these people, we don't talk to them.

2:05:27.100 --> 2:05:28.100
 We force, you know.

2:05:28.100 --> 2:05:31.100
 And eventually, little by little, things going through.

2:05:32.940 --> 2:05:34.420
 Yeah, you have these people,

2:05:34.420 --> 2:05:37.860
 they're very much on the Marxist socialist train.

2:05:37.860 --> 2:05:40.860
 So do you think the sort of,

2:05:40.860 --> 2:05:44.220
 it's the political movements that are just using?

2:05:44.220 --> 2:05:48.180
 Yeah, because what happened back in those days, it is true.

2:05:49.180 --> 2:05:52.980
 But to their credit, communist socialists

2:05:52.980 --> 2:05:55.020
 were fighting for equal rights.

2:05:55.020 --> 2:05:56.860
 They were fighting for equal rights.

2:05:56.860 --> 2:05:58.900
 They were fighting for the rights of black people

2:05:58.900 --> 2:06:00.780
 to have equal rights.

2:06:00.780 --> 2:06:05.140
 So of course, I could see why one could say,

2:06:05.140 --> 2:06:09.340
 especially in this times, you've been lynched,

2:06:10.380 --> 2:06:15.380
 bodies burnt, body parts showcased at window stores.

2:06:15.380 --> 2:06:20.380
 Meanwhile, in Africa, under colonization,

2:06:22.140 --> 2:06:25.140
 in your own country, in your own land.

2:06:29.420 --> 2:06:32.020
 And you have this group that's saying,

2:06:34.140 --> 2:06:38.140
 your fight is part of what we fight.

2:06:39.580 --> 2:06:42.220
 And you have this group that's saying,

2:06:42.220 --> 2:06:45.540
 your fight is part of what we fight.

2:06:48.540 --> 2:06:51.180
 Of course, you're gonna say I side with you,

2:06:51.180 --> 2:06:54.380
 especially if this is all happening at a time

2:06:56.180 --> 2:07:01.180
 where, you know, so 1945, these guys who would be

2:07:01.940 --> 2:07:04.300
 the liberators of various African nations,

2:07:04.300 --> 2:07:08.820
 they're meeting with Garvey, with W. E. B. Du Bois.

2:07:08.820 --> 2:07:11.620
 And that's where this meeting is very important.

2:07:11.620 --> 2:07:13.740
 It's the fifth Pan African Congress meeting.

2:07:13.740 --> 2:07:14.900
 It's very important.

2:07:14.900 --> 2:07:17.540
 It's gonna be the last one, but it's the most important one

2:07:17.540 --> 2:07:19.300
 because that's when they formed their plans

2:07:19.300 --> 2:07:22.100
 and really rallied around this concept

2:07:22.100 --> 2:07:26.220
 of African emancipation and African liberation.

2:07:26.220 --> 2:07:28.020
 We're gonna liberate our countries.

2:07:29.100 --> 2:07:31.580
 Then later, so that's how all of these movements

2:07:31.580 --> 2:07:32.900
 started to happen.

2:07:32.900 --> 2:07:35.820
 And from there, Gandhi was already making some progress

2:07:35.820 --> 2:07:39.220
 with India, you know, getting them out of British rule

2:07:39.220 --> 2:07:40.060
 and all of that.

2:07:40.060 --> 2:07:41.460
 So all of this was happening and it really like,

2:07:41.460 --> 2:07:43.340
 this whole thing was bubbling, bubbling, bubbling,

2:07:43.340 --> 2:07:46.260
 you know, like there's like a new force going on.

2:07:46.260 --> 2:07:48.700
 And then we arrive in the late fifties

2:07:48.700 --> 2:07:52.300
 and, you know, Kuma with, you know,

2:07:52.300 --> 2:07:53.340
 them with the British as well,

2:07:53.340 --> 2:07:58.340
 they might manage to become their colonization is over.

2:07:59.740 --> 2:08:02.100
 They're the first one to go in, 57.

2:08:02.100 --> 2:08:04.740
 Then from there, it's what we call the independences.

2:08:04.740 --> 2:08:06.820
 That's what most of Sub Saharan African nation

2:08:06.820 --> 2:08:08.580
 are getting their independence is different dates.

2:08:08.580 --> 2:08:11.060
 Mine, April 4th, 1960.

2:08:11.060 --> 2:08:13.220
 So all over, so this is happening.

2:08:13.220 --> 2:08:14.060
 And now think about it.

2:08:14.060 --> 2:08:16.660
 You're talking 57, you're talking 60.

2:08:16.660 --> 2:08:21.420
 We're like at this time now with the middle of a Cold War.

2:08:21.420 --> 2:08:22.780
 Because we have to put things in context

2:08:22.780 --> 2:08:24.380
 if we wanna understand what's going on.

2:08:24.380 --> 2:08:26.740
 Because people today ask me, why do you think,

2:08:26.740 --> 2:08:28.100
 because even now when they understand,

2:08:28.100 --> 2:08:30.220
 oh, you're right, it makes sense.

2:08:30.220 --> 2:08:32.580
 If you have no economic freedom, you're gonna be poor.

2:08:32.580 --> 2:08:35.020
 But why, why, why did they go for this?

2:08:35.020 --> 2:08:35.860
 Why did they go for this?

2:08:35.860 --> 2:08:37.020
 And then they don't understand.

2:08:37.020 --> 2:08:37.900
 So that's what happened.

2:08:37.900 --> 2:08:41.980
 So beginning of day of times, pre colonial Africans

2:08:41.980 --> 2:08:44.340
 were free marketeers, free enterprise.

2:08:44.340 --> 2:08:47.220
 It's pretty well recorded by someone like George Aite.

2:08:47.220 --> 2:08:49.340
 That's where I got the cheat I think from

2:08:49.340 --> 2:08:50.740
 and Ghanaian economist.

2:08:50.740 --> 2:08:52.980
 And then slavery happened, colonialism happened.

2:08:52.980 --> 2:08:55.860
 And then the independences, late fifties, early sixties

2:08:55.860 --> 2:08:58.940
 for most sub Saharan African countries.

2:08:58.940 --> 2:09:00.740
 So there what you have is,

2:09:00.740 --> 2:09:02.100
 but then what happened there?

2:09:02.100 --> 2:09:05.580
 So I told you in 45, fifth Pan African Congress in the UK

2:09:05.580 --> 2:09:10.580
 with the liberators of Africa under the leadership

2:09:11.500 --> 2:09:14.820
 because he was the wise, you know, eldest man.

2:09:15.860 --> 2:09:17.860
 Dubois was, he was in his seventies back in the day.

2:09:17.860 --> 2:09:19.220
 So he's older than them, you know,

2:09:19.220 --> 2:09:21.460
 and he's coming with all of his ideas and everything.

2:09:21.460 --> 2:09:22.540
 So they're like, ooh.

2:09:22.540 --> 2:09:23.780
 So there they are.

2:09:23.780 --> 2:09:25.540
 Now we're in the late fifties, early sixties.

2:09:25.540 --> 2:09:28.020
 We're starting to make progress with the independences.

2:09:28.020 --> 2:09:29.660
 You know, India has gone there before.

2:09:29.660 --> 2:09:31.580
 So all of that is starting to happen.

2:09:32.780 --> 2:09:35.300
 And at that time, remember,

2:09:35.300 --> 2:09:37.700
 they already were being introduced

2:09:37.700 --> 2:09:40.340
 to the concept of socialism, Marxism,

2:09:40.340 --> 2:09:44.820
 all of that way before by some of these, you know,

2:09:44.820 --> 2:09:48.060
 black African American intellectuals of their time

2:09:48.060 --> 2:09:51.260
 who were very socialist Marxist by that time.

2:09:51.260 --> 2:09:54.140
 So now they're becoming independent

2:09:54.140 --> 2:09:56.620
 because I do independent like this

2:09:56.620 --> 2:10:00.700
 because I reckon that there's still neocolonism going on.

2:10:00.700 --> 2:10:04.020
 So now this is happening, they're becoming free.

2:10:04.020 --> 2:10:06.220
 But then you look around, what do you see?

2:10:07.260 --> 2:10:10.500
 That now most of these liberators of their nations

2:10:10.500 --> 2:10:12.380
 become the president of the nations.

2:10:12.380 --> 2:10:13.740
 But remember what I told you?

2:10:13.740 --> 2:10:18.740
 Most of them have dranken the Marxist socialism Koolaid.

2:10:21.740 --> 2:10:25.460
 So as these African nations become independent

2:10:25.460 --> 2:10:27.660
 with their first independent governments

2:10:27.660 --> 2:10:31.540
 and, you know, presidents, most of them,

2:10:31.540 --> 2:10:34.620
 most of them are socialist,

2:10:34.620 --> 2:10:37.300
 various forms of statist type of government.

2:10:38.220 --> 2:10:40.220
 And this is because at that point,

2:10:40.220 --> 2:10:43.220
 we had made a fatal mistake of going,

2:10:43.220 --> 2:10:48.220
 of saying we are Marxist socialist

2:10:48.260 --> 2:10:51.700
 because you guys fight for equal rights.

2:10:51.700 --> 2:10:53.340
 So in this case, there should be no colonialism

2:10:53.340 --> 2:10:54.940
 or anything like that.

2:10:54.940 --> 2:10:58.700
 So not only you have that going on and the people,

2:10:58.700 --> 2:11:01.980
 so right now you had this battle of ideology going on

2:11:01.980 --> 2:11:04.780
 because on one end represented by freedom

2:11:04.780 --> 2:11:06.020
 and the economic, what do you call it?

2:11:06.020 --> 2:11:08.380
 The economic system they were using is capitalism.

2:11:08.380 --> 2:11:12.100
 And these are represented by the Western nations

2:11:12.100 --> 2:11:14.260
 facing off with Eastern block,

2:11:14.260 --> 2:11:16.220
 practicing various forms of statism,

2:11:16.220 --> 2:11:19.060
 socialism, communism, various forms of statism.

2:11:19.060 --> 2:11:21.460
 And these two are fighting for influence.

2:11:21.460 --> 2:11:25.180
 So, and we also have, it's also not, so two things there.

2:11:25.180 --> 2:11:27.300
 One is we're at a time where,

2:11:27.300 --> 2:11:29.940
 remember the free market concept was almost dead,

2:11:30.820 --> 2:11:31.860
 almost dead.

2:11:33.020 --> 2:11:35.940
 So almost every intellectual at that time

2:11:35.940 --> 2:11:40.260
 was social Marxist or Marxist socialist,

2:11:40.260 --> 2:11:42.260
 I put the name, that's what you were.

2:11:42.260 --> 2:11:45.140
 So you're in a world where it was a normal thing,

2:11:45.140 --> 2:11:47.900
 it was just mainstream acceptance.

2:11:47.900 --> 2:11:49.700
 So not only you have that force,

2:11:49.700 --> 2:11:51.700
 but at the same time,

2:11:51.700 --> 2:11:53.500
 if these two forces are fighting one another,

2:11:53.500 --> 2:11:57.140
 it turns out that the one representing capitalism

2:11:57.140 --> 2:11:59.380
 and freedom, well, sorry,

2:11:59.380 --> 2:12:03.140
 but isn't it you who enslaved us and colonized us?

2:12:03.140 --> 2:12:06.780
 And you're fighting with the people who represent,

2:12:06.780 --> 2:12:09.740
 supposedly people who are saying that

2:12:09.740 --> 2:12:11.580
 who had been fighting for equal rights for us,

2:12:11.580 --> 2:12:15.100
 with us for the longest time, these are our friends.

2:12:15.100 --> 2:12:17.180
 And that's when we made a fatal mistake

2:12:17.180 --> 2:12:19.260
 because while yes, there were maybe good things

2:12:19.260 --> 2:12:23.500
 to agree on with Marxist socialist of the times,

2:12:23.500 --> 2:12:28.060
 especially equal rights for all people and all of that,

2:12:28.060 --> 2:12:29.340
 that's the only thing we should have,

2:12:29.340 --> 2:12:31.500
 among the only things we should have agreed upon.

2:12:31.500 --> 2:12:35.060
 There are violent revolution tendencies, no way.

2:12:35.060 --> 2:12:38.900
 When it comes to the economic nonsense, no way.

2:12:38.900 --> 2:12:41.340
 We should not have thrown the baby out with the bathwater,

2:12:41.340 --> 2:12:42.460
 but that's what we did.

2:12:42.460 --> 2:12:43.820
 And that's when we made a fatal mistake.

2:12:43.820 --> 2:12:46.900
 So then we became free, all of these nations,

2:12:46.900 --> 2:12:51.900
 and most of them started with socialist or communist leaders.

2:12:52.140 --> 2:12:56.500
 My country, socialist, Léopold Sédar Senghor,

2:12:56.500 --> 2:12:58.380
 he was a socialist.

2:12:58.380 --> 2:13:01.180
 And they stayed in power for 40 years,

2:13:01.180 --> 2:13:04.540
 the first 40 years of our freedom years.

2:13:05.700 --> 2:13:07.740
 And all over the continent, more or less,

2:13:07.740 --> 2:13:09.340
 that's what you had.

2:13:09.340 --> 2:13:11.140
 And on top of that,

2:13:11.140 --> 2:13:12.780
 something else that the French don't know,

2:13:12.780 --> 2:13:16.140
 the people don't know is France with its colonies said,

2:13:16.140 --> 2:13:18.220
 you cannot, not do,

2:13:18.220 --> 2:13:23.220
 you have to keep the French civil law.

2:13:25.140 --> 2:13:29.580
 So we're talking about the Napoleonic civil code.

2:13:29.580 --> 2:13:31.100
 Are you kidding me?

2:13:31.100 --> 2:13:32.300
 So that's what happened.

2:13:32.300 --> 2:13:37.300
 So the reason why I go back to BLM is while I have

2:13:37.460 --> 2:13:40.180
 all the respect in the world

2:13:40.180 --> 2:13:43.140
 and all the compassion in the world

2:13:43.140 --> 2:13:45.500
 for people like Krummer, for people like Nyerere,

2:13:45.500 --> 2:13:48.420
 for people, all of us people of those times,

2:13:48.420 --> 2:13:50.140
 the liberators of Africa,

2:13:50.140 --> 2:13:53.540
 while I have so much love, compassion for them,

2:13:54.700 --> 2:13:57.100
 I am also able to say,

2:13:57.100 --> 2:14:01.500
 because I got the benefit of 60 some years time,

2:14:01.500 --> 2:14:05.620
 and where you get to do a debrief

2:14:05.620 --> 2:14:08.380
 and see what worked, what didn't work, what happened.

2:14:08.380 --> 2:14:13.060
 We have had the 60 years to look back and to reflect.

2:14:13.060 --> 2:14:17.620
 So yes, I can understand why they did what they did.

2:14:17.620 --> 2:14:21.500
 I can understand why they sided with these people

2:14:21.500 --> 2:14:24.260
 who on the surface, or at least some part of a fight

2:14:24.260 --> 2:14:27.220
 was the same fight as them when it came to equal rights.

2:14:29.740 --> 2:14:30.940
 I can excuse them,

2:14:32.660 --> 2:14:37.580
 but I will not excuse the BLM founders

2:14:37.580 --> 2:14:42.580
 because that mistake was tolerable 60 some years ago.

2:14:43.700 --> 2:14:45.980
 Today, no.

2:14:45.980 --> 2:14:50.980
 The blacks of today cannot be serious

2:14:51.100 --> 2:14:55.900
 about black lives mattering and saying in the same sentence,

2:14:55.900 --> 2:14:58.500
 and we're going to be socialist Marx, Marxist socialist.

2:14:58.500 --> 2:14:59.820
 It just doesn't work.

2:14:59.820 --> 2:15:03.540
 So the BLM movement is too deeply integrated

2:15:03.540 --> 2:15:06.260
 with the ideas of Marxism.

2:15:06.260 --> 2:15:10.940
 Yeah, they're anti free market, anti capitalist.

2:15:10.940 --> 2:15:15.540
 And we do know that you have to have the free markets

2:15:15.540 --> 2:15:17.380
 in order to build prosperity.

2:15:17.380 --> 2:15:21.900
 And prosperity means economic power.

2:15:21.900 --> 2:15:26.540
 If you have economic power, no one messes with you,

2:15:26.540 --> 2:15:28.380
 or if they're gonna do it, they're gonna have to think twice.

2:15:28.380 --> 2:15:31.180
 And when they do, they're gonna have to pay consequences.

2:15:32.580 --> 2:15:35.380
 So if you want for blacks to be respected

2:15:35.380 --> 2:15:37.220
 anywhere in the world,

2:15:37.220 --> 2:15:39.980
 you're gonna have to be serious about black prosperity,

2:15:39.980 --> 2:15:42.220
 all mass, not just a few people,

2:15:42.220 --> 2:15:44.900
 Oprah over here and somebody over there, no.

2:15:44.900 --> 2:15:49.900
 We as a group have to be critical mass of prosperity

2:15:50.820 --> 2:15:52.580
 across the board.

2:15:52.580 --> 2:15:55.380
 And because we're talking critical mass of prosperity

2:15:55.380 --> 2:15:56.620
 across the board,

2:15:56.620 --> 2:15:59.820
 it means black people everywhere in the world.

2:15:59.820 --> 2:16:00.900
 But guess what?

2:16:00.900 --> 2:16:04.900
 We in Africa happen to represent 90% of our representatives

2:16:04.900 --> 2:16:06.180
 of a black race.

2:16:06.180 --> 2:16:08.980
 So you're gonna be serious about black lives mattering

2:16:08.980 --> 2:16:11.420
 without being serious for Africa,

2:16:11.420 --> 2:16:14.100
 the 1 billion people in Africa that are black

2:16:14.100 --> 2:16:16.340
 and for them to have access to the free markets

2:16:16.340 --> 2:16:18.180
 and yes, fossil fuels,

2:16:18.180 --> 2:16:23.180
 so that they can rocket up prosperity wise.

2:16:25.220 --> 2:16:27.700
 And the resources of the young people, the young minds.

2:16:27.700 --> 2:16:29.620
 So that all of these young people, young minds

2:16:29.620 --> 2:16:33.700
 can finally manifest their greatness that I know they have

2:16:33.700 --> 2:16:35.220
 and that they're showing us every day

2:16:35.220 --> 2:16:37.740
 despite the obstacles.

2:16:38.620 --> 2:16:40.100
 That's what we need.

2:16:40.100 --> 2:16:42.660
 Senegal becomes rich and Senegal can become

2:16:42.660 --> 2:16:45.020
 and will be richer than France.

2:16:45.020 --> 2:16:46.700
 Singapore did it, we can do it.

2:16:47.780 --> 2:16:52.260
 Mali rich, Nigeria rich, functioning as well.

2:16:52.260 --> 2:16:56.540
 Malawi rich, Tanzania rich, Uganda rich,

2:16:56.540 --> 2:17:01.540
 Zimbabwe rich, Niger rich, everywhere rich prosperous

2:17:01.540 --> 2:17:05.580
 as prosperous, if not more prosperous than Switzerland

2:17:05.580 --> 2:17:07.860
 or Singapore or the U.S.

2:17:07.860 --> 2:17:09.860
 I don't know, or the Lichtenstein or Luxembourg,

2:17:09.860 --> 2:17:14.860
 places that have no natural resources.

2:17:15.500 --> 2:17:18.620
 We become rich and you watch the world

2:17:18.620 --> 2:17:21.940
 having a very different relationship with us.

2:17:21.940 --> 2:17:26.740
 That's the only time we will commend any type of respect.

2:17:26.740 --> 2:17:31.740
 That's when people, even our common psyche will change

2:17:32.940 --> 2:17:34.180
 even about black people.

2:17:34.180 --> 2:17:36.820
 All of the stereotypes that they have of us

2:17:36.820 --> 2:17:39.620
 is gonna melt away.

2:17:39.620 --> 2:17:44.140
 And you may still not like us, but you will still respect us

2:17:44.140 --> 2:17:47.260
 because we are a force to be dealt with.

2:17:47.260 --> 2:17:49.660
 And only economic power does that.

2:17:49.660 --> 2:17:53.540
 It would be nice, of course, for us to respect people

2:17:53.540 --> 2:17:54.900
 because they're people.

2:17:54.900 --> 2:17:58.100
 It would be nice, but let us not kid ourselves.

2:17:58.100 --> 2:18:00.300
 This is earth.

2:18:00.300 --> 2:18:03.660
 And someone said, nice people will make it to heaven,

2:18:03.660 --> 2:18:05.460
 but not to Harvard necessarily.

2:18:05.460 --> 2:18:06.300
 It's true.

2:18:06.300 --> 2:18:11.300
 It's interesting that pity does not ever turn into respect.

2:18:12.660 --> 2:18:14.180
 It would be nice if it did.

2:18:14.180 --> 2:18:16.580
 It would be nice, but it doesn't.

2:18:16.580 --> 2:18:17.580
 Prosperity is the only thing.

2:18:17.580 --> 2:18:19.060
 Prosperity is the only thing.

2:18:19.060 --> 2:18:21.420
 And the way we do that, there is no,

2:18:21.420 --> 2:18:26.420
 just like all of us humans have to inhale oxygen

2:18:27.660 --> 2:18:30.580
 and exhale carbon dioxide.

2:18:30.580 --> 2:18:32.780
 That's a human way of breathing.

2:18:32.780 --> 2:18:35.140
 You bring me on, but you wanna be foolish

2:18:35.140 --> 2:18:36.980
 and be like, oh, well, sorry.

2:18:36.980 --> 2:18:38.180
 That's how white people breathe.

2:18:38.180 --> 2:18:39.260
 So as black people,

2:18:39.260 --> 2:18:40.340
 we're gonna have to do something different.

2:18:40.340 --> 2:18:42.060
 Well, good luck with that.

2:18:42.060 --> 2:18:42.900
 Right?

2:18:42.900 --> 2:18:44.460
 So this is here why I'm saying,

2:18:44.460 --> 2:18:46.620
 I have no patience for Black Lives Matter.

2:18:46.620 --> 2:18:51.380
 They're making a mistake that was made 60 some plus 60.

2:18:51.380 --> 2:18:53.940
 Years ago, even more than that.

2:18:53.940 --> 2:18:55.300
 Maybe even a hundred, you know,

2:18:55.300 --> 2:18:58.300
 when we were siding with the Marxist socialists

2:18:58.300 --> 2:19:00.340
 because they're the ones who've been fighting

2:19:00.340 --> 2:19:01.420
 for equal rights.

2:19:03.700 --> 2:19:07.460
 Let me ask you though, about racism.

2:19:08.700 --> 2:19:11.020
 Do you, as you travel through this world,

2:19:11.020 --> 2:19:13.260
 as you travel through America,

2:19:13.260 --> 2:19:16.660
 feel the burn of hatred?

2:19:18.300 --> 2:19:19.940
 You've spoken about the revolutions

2:19:19.940 --> 2:19:23.340
 that have been fought throughout the 20th century

2:19:23.340 --> 2:19:25.740
 against racism.

2:19:25.740 --> 2:19:29.300
 But today, as people talk about educating,

2:19:29.300 --> 2:19:31.460
 reminding the world with the,

2:19:31.460 --> 2:19:33.340
 even with more philosophical ideas

2:19:33.340 --> 2:19:35.780
 of critical race theory, for example,

2:19:35.780 --> 2:19:38.460
 do you think this is still a battle

2:19:38.460 --> 2:19:40.740
 that needs to be fought

2:19:40.740 --> 2:19:43.620
 at the forefront of culture in the United States?

2:19:43.620 --> 2:19:48.620
 Um, does racism exist?

2:19:48.820 --> 2:19:49.660
 Yes, it does.

2:19:52.100 --> 2:19:54.180
 But all forms of isms exist.

2:19:55.180 --> 2:19:58.020
 Some people, it's about various forms of ableism.

2:19:59.780 --> 2:20:01.700
 Others, it's about size.

2:20:02.900 --> 2:20:05.420
 And racism, yes, is one of them.

2:20:05.420 --> 2:20:06.260
 Does it exist?

2:20:06.260 --> 2:20:07.100
 Yes, it does.

2:20:08.420 --> 2:20:11.300
 But is it what's gonna stop anyone

2:20:11.300 --> 2:20:13.620
 from manifesting their greatest potential?

2:20:14.820 --> 2:20:16.220
 I say no.

2:20:16.220 --> 2:20:18.340
 I say no.

2:20:18.340 --> 2:20:20.660
 Many people in this country have showed it.

2:20:22.020 --> 2:20:23.460
 Whether they're African Americans

2:20:23.460 --> 2:20:26.380
 or African immigrant, I'm an African immigrant.

2:20:27.540 --> 2:20:30.020
 You have African Americans like Oprah and others,

2:20:30.020 --> 2:20:31.820
 and other people even before her,

2:20:32.940 --> 2:20:36.580
 who despite the nastiness around them,

2:20:36.580 --> 2:20:37.780
 were able to make it.

2:20:37.780 --> 2:20:41.580
 So we do know, especially as black people,

2:20:41.580 --> 2:20:44.020
 but I think it's humanity as a whole.

2:20:44.020 --> 2:20:46.460
 And that's what I love about the human spirit.

2:20:46.460 --> 2:20:48.620
 It's resiliency.

2:20:48.620 --> 2:20:50.180
 But resiliency only can happen

2:20:50.180 --> 2:20:53.060
 if you don't allow yourself to be beaten down

2:20:54.260 --> 2:20:56.540
 and to lose yourself of agency.

2:20:58.340 --> 2:21:01.740
 It's, of course, easier said than done.

2:21:01.740 --> 2:21:05.740
 And some among us need a little bit more help

2:21:05.740 --> 2:21:08.580
 to not succumb for it than others do.

2:21:09.860 --> 2:21:10.940
 And I've seen it.

2:21:10.940 --> 2:21:12.620
 It might be harder for you

2:21:12.620 --> 2:21:16.900
 if you're somewhere in inner city,

2:21:18.020 --> 2:21:19.980
 inner city black America.

2:21:19.980 --> 2:21:22.860
 Maybe the environment might be a little bit tougher

2:21:22.860 --> 2:21:24.300
 for you to try and get your act together

2:21:24.300 --> 2:21:25.860
 and all of that stuff.

2:21:25.860 --> 2:21:27.700
 And it's okay.

2:21:27.700 --> 2:21:30.300
 But even in that situation,

2:21:32.060 --> 2:21:34.300
 we need to, I think it's important

2:21:34.300 --> 2:21:37.420
 that we still do not rob you of your agency.

2:21:39.220 --> 2:21:42.460
 And this is where I am mad as heck

2:21:42.460 --> 2:21:46.660
 against those who supposedly care

2:21:46.660 --> 2:21:50.300
 and their idea of how to make sure

2:21:50.300 --> 2:21:53.380
 that I don't become or stay a victim of racism

2:21:53.380 --> 2:21:55.260
 is through all the things we talked about,

2:21:55.260 --> 2:22:00.260
 the CRT, the anti racism crap of, you know,

2:22:00.260 --> 2:22:05.260
 Ibrahim X. Kendi and what's her name, Robin DiAngelo.

2:22:05.020 --> 2:22:07.020
 I mean her, I'm shocked.

2:22:07.020 --> 2:22:09.300
 The woman is making all of this money

2:22:09.300 --> 2:22:13.060
 supposedly fighting a war on our behalf.

2:22:13.060 --> 2:22:15.500
 I'm like, lady, I hear you loud and clear

2:22:15.500 --> 2:22:16.900
 that you are a true racist.

2:22:16.900 --> 2:22:19.180
 I know, but you told me you are.

2:22:19.180 --> 2:22:20.780
 And for you to think that your anti racism

2:22:20.780 --> 2:22:24.060
 makes you less racist and it's, that happens too.

2:22:24.060 --> 2:22:26.180
 She comes from a racist background.

2:22:26.180 --> 2:22:28.180
 Fine, she's saying it, it's true.

2:22:28.180 --> 2:22:33.180
 But this idea that every walking person on earth

2:22:33.220 --> 2:22:34.620
 belongs to one category or the other,

2:22:34.620 --> 2:22:37.420
 depending on what, you know, which skin color you came with,

2:22:38.420 --> 2:22:41.220
 it's problematic at its root.

2:22:41.220 --> 2:22:44.700
 So my point is, does racism exist?

2:22:44.700 --> 2:22:45.540
 Yes.

2:22:46.780 --> 2:22:47.620
 Do you think it's gonna stop me

2:22:47.620 --> 2:22:49.340
 from doing anything I have to do?

2:22:49.340 --> 2:22:50.500
 No.

2:22:50.500 --> 2:22:53.020
 Might it make it harder, longer?

2:22:53.020 --> 2:22:57.100
 Maybe, but it will not stop me from doing anything.

2:22:57.100 --> 2:22:58.500
 But it will not stop me.

2:23:00.180 --> 2:23:01.940
 But for it not to stop me,

2:23:01.940 --> 2:23:04.380
 I can't engage in victimhood mentality.

2:23:04.380 --> 2:23:05.980
 I can't lose myself as self.

2:23:05.980 --> 2:23:09.540
 I got to use all the agency that I have

2:23:09.540 --> 2:23:12.380
 to fight back and fight beyond.

2:23:12.380 --> 2:23:14.460
 See, it's just a bit of fight back.

2:23:14.460 --> 2:23:15.740
 You fight back and you fight beyond.

2:23:15.740 --> 2:23:18.460
 Cause at some point, yeah and.

2:23:18.460 --> 2:23:19.940
 It's this concept of yes and.

2:23:20.900 --> 2:23:24.220
 So this is why I have loved the job.

2:23:24.220 --> 2:23:26.340
 So when I have somebody who is like,

2:23:26.340 --> 2:23:28.780
 oh, anti racism is a way.

2:23:28.780 --> 2:23:31.260
 We're gonna go and tell all the white kids

2:23:31.260 --> 2:23:32.980
 that, you know, because they will happen to be white,

2:23:32.980 --> 2:23:35.580
 that they're really the oppressors and blah, blah, blah.

2:23:35.580 --> 2:23:38.820
 And the black kids, because they're black, you know,

2:23:38.820 --> 2:23:41.500
 you're not changing anything when you're doing that.

2:23:41.500 --> 2:23:43.060
 Nothing except that you're causing,

2:23:43.060 --> 2:23:43.980
 you're putting problems

2:23:43.980 --> 2:23:46.300
 where there were no problems to start with.

2:23:46.300 --> 2:23:48.140
 All we had to do was maybe

2:23:48.140 --> 2:23:50.060
 go for a different route from there.

2:23:50.060 --> 2:23:51.260
 Kids are kids.

2:23:51.260 --> 2:23:52.460
 Kids are born kids.

2:23:52.460 --> 2:23:54.500
 And this, I'm not sure if you want to get me going

2:23:54.500 --> 2:23:57.580
 onto the whole science of bias,

2:23:57.580 --> 2:23:59.940
 because that's something I spent years of my life on.

2:23:59.940 --> 2:24:03.860
 And my journey on the science of bias

2:24:03.860 --> 2:24:08.060
 started with the days of Philando Castile,

2:24:08.060 --> 2:24:12.300
 Eric Garner, that whole summer of 2016,

2:24:12.300 --> 2:24:17.300
 when we had this horrendous, horrendous situation

2:24:17.340 --> 2:24:20.340
 of black people being killed by the police,

2:24:20.340 --> 2:24:22.420
 where they shot before asking,

2:24:22.420 --> 2:24:24.860
 and people left to die in the most inhumane way

2:24:24.860 --> 2:24:28.020
 for the rest of us to watch from the social media.

2:24:28.020 --> 2:24:29.820
 That's me.

2:24:29.820 --> 2:24:31.340
 That's when my George Floyd moment happened.

2:24:31.340 --> 2:24:32.420
 Not later than four years ago,

2:24:32.420 --> 2:24:35.100
 and the whole world is like, you know.

2:24:35.100 --> 2:24:38.620
 So that sent me on a journey

2:24:38.620 --> 2:24:42.020
 of understanding what discrimination is and bias is.

2:24:43.620 --> 2:24:45.460
 And in a way, that's the reason why I started this company

2:24:45.460 --> 2:24:47.900
 that I even called Skinny Skin.

2:24:47.900 --> 2:24:49.180
 That's where it came from.

2:24:49.180 --> 2:24:51.140
 Again, criticized by creating.

2:24:51.140 --> 2:24:53.860
 I needed to understand what discrimination was.

2:24:53.860 --> 2:24:55.060
 How does it work?

2:24:55.060 --> 2:24:56.900
 Is it true what Kendi is saying?

2:24:56.900 --> 2:24:58.620
 Is it true what DAngelo is saying?

2:24:58.620 --> 2:25:03.620
 Is it true that it could be that your race

2:25:03.820 --> 2:25:06.500
 is just because of the skin color you happen to be born in?

2:25:06.500 --> 2:25:08.220
 Is it true?

2:25:08.220 --> 2:25:09.260
 Is it true?

2:25:09.260 --> 2:25:12.540
 I needed to know, because I was at a time of my life

2:25:12.540 --> 2:25:14.660
 where at some point, you know,

2:25:14.660 --> 2:25:16.780
 when those killings were happening,

2:25:16.780 --> 2:25:21.020
 it was so hard for me being a black person in this country.

2:25:21.020 --> 2:25:22.580
 And wondering,

2:25:27.780 --> 2:25:29.420
 I mean, what is this?

2:25:29.420 --> 2:25:31.700
 And what do we do with this?

2:25:33.980 --> 2:25:34.900
 Yeah, is it true?

2:25:34.900 --> 2:25:38.660
 How much discrimination am I operating under in the system?

2:25:38.660 --> 2:25:39.780
 All of that.

2:25:39.780 --> 2:25:42.540
 You need to understand the full characteristics of,

2:25:42.540 --> 2:25:45.260
 if you're dreaming of making a big change

2:25:45.260 --> 2:25:49.220
 by building companies, you have to kind of intuit,

2:25:49.220 --> 2:25:51.100
 how much, what am I up against?

2:25:51.100 --> 2:25:52.340
 What am I up against, right?

2:25:52.340 --> 2:25:53.580
 And so this is why, you know,

2:25:53.580 --> 2:25:55.860
 spend all of this time on some of the work.

2:25:55.860 --> 2:25:58.860
 And then eventually I understood that discrimination,

2:25:58.860 --> 2:26:01.340
 if you wanted to understand it beyond,

2:26:01.340 --> 2:26:04.540
 it's, you know, beyond the big lines of,

2:26:04.540 --> 2:26:06.500
 especially the clickbait lines

2:26:06.500 --> 2:26:08.780
 would make it very black and white.

2:26:08.780 --> 2:26:11.300
 Then I had to really take a moment and I spent time,

2:26:11.300 --> 2:26:13.700
 you know, with a world of brain scientists,

2:26:13.700 --> 2:26:16.700
 with behavioral psychologists,

2:26:16.700 --> 2:26:18.580
 with evolutionary biologists.

2:26:18.580 --> 2:26:21.780
 We have all of this ecosystem, but together form

2:26:21.780 --> 2:26:25.380
 what one might call the science of bias.

2:26:25.380 --> 2:26:28.780
 And especially I came across the work

2:26:28.780 --> 2:26:31.820
 of this team of scientists at the University of,

2:26:31.820 --> 2:26:33.460
 I think it's Wisconsin,

2:26:33.460 --> 2:26:35.900
 and they're the only ones who made sense

2:26:36.980 --> 2:26:39.180
 in this sea of nonsense back then.

2:26:40.140 --> 2:26:42.700
 And this article was in Politico,

2:26:43.660 --> 2:26:47.060
 and it was saying something that I could relate to it.

2:26:47.060 --> 2:26:49.820
 And eventually what I learned was,

2:26:50.740 --> 2:26:54.220
 and this part comes from the evolutionary biologist people,

2:26:54.220 --> 2:26:58.100
 they in a way tell you that right around age three,

2:26:58.100 --> 2:26:59.460
 can happen sooner or later,

2:26:59.460 --> 2:27:01.260
 because you know, we're all different,

2:27:01.260 --> 2:27:04.220
 but you go from this person who has to rely

2:27:04.220 --> 2:27:07.780
 on these other people, usually your parents, to stay alive,

2:27:07.780 --> 2:27:10.980
 to be fed, to be housed, to be in your diaper change,

2:27:10.980 --> 2:27:12.900
 all of that stuff, right?

2:27:12.900 --> 2:27:15.660
 To now, something is kicking in.

2:27:15.660 --> 2:27:20.660
 Where you have to, in order for you to survive,

2:27:21.660 --> 2:27:23.500
 and this is all wired in,

2:27:23.500 --> 2:27:25.900
 so you don't even understand it consciously,

2:27:25.900 --> 2:27:27.340
 as I'm saying it now,

2:27:27.340 --> 2:27:29.700
 where in order for you to survive,

2:27:29.700 --> 2:27:32.060
 in order for you to go from this state of dependency

2:27:32.060 --> 2:27:35.820
 to the next stage and more and more and more,

2:27:35.820 --> 2:27:37.740
 you're gonna have to develop this ability

2:27:37.740 --> 2:27:39.540
 to make sense of the world.

2:27:39.540 --> 2:27:41.020
 And what's making sense of a world

2:27:41.020 --> 2:27:43.420
 at its most basic level means is,

2:27:43.420 --> 2:27:46.340
 can you determine if a situation

2:27:46.340 --> 2:27:48.820
 or a person is good or bad for you?

2:27:49.980 --> 2:27:54.100
 Failure, and you need to be able to do so ever so quickly,

2:27:54.100 --> 2:27:56.660
 because failure to be able to do that

2:27:56.660 --> 2:27:59.300
 means that you might not be alive the next second.

2:28:00.580 --> 2:28:02.900
 See, it's so wired in.

2:28:02.900 --> 2:28:04.780
 So this process is starting to kick in.

2:28:06.020 --> 2:28:07.580
 And at that point,

2:28:07.580 --> 2:28:09.980
 your brain is gonna be your best ally for that.

2:28:09.980 --> 2:28:12.820
 And what the brain is gonna do is it's gonna help you,

2:28:12.820 --> 2:28:15.100
 and the way the brain works is through,

2:28:15.100 --> 2:28:19.220
 it works with, it's all wired for efficiency.

2:28:19.220 --> 2:28:24.220
 And the way it goes for efficiency is through automation,

2:28:24.300 --> 2:28:25.980
 meaning that every time it has computed,

2:28:25.980 --> 2:28:27.540
 and you probably know these things way better than me,

2:28:27.540 --> 2:28:30.940
 every time it has computed one algorithm,

2:28:30.940 --> 2:28:33.420
 it doesn't want to do it again.

2:28:33.420 --> 2:28:37.060
 It's almost like this, okay, got it, stored, stored, right?

2:28:37.060 --> 2:28:40.020
 And then it adds maybe some little levels of complexity to it,

2:28:40.020 --> 2:28:41.380
 but it has to be something new,

2:28:41.380 --> 2:28:43.100
 meaning the new level of complexity

2:28:43.100 --> 2:28:45.740
 for it to even be willing to reconsider.

2:28:45.740 --> 2:28:47.180
 Otherwise you have, so then all of a sudden

2:28:47.180 --> 2:28:50.700
 what you have is these neurons in the back of your head,

2:28:50.700 --> 2:28:53.420
 and they have created pathways, right?

2:28:53.420 --> 2:28:56.540
 So, and every time neurons have created pathway

2:28:56.540 --> 2:29:00.140
 among themselves, because basically they're attached,

2:29:00.140 --> 2:29:01.380
 and here is the pathway,

2:29:01.380 --> 2:29:03.620
 well, this pathway in the world of,

2:29:03.620 --> 2:29:08.620
 in the world of science of bias, it's a habit.

2:29:08.620 --> 2:29:10.620
 In general, it's a habit when they form two pathways,

2:29:10.620 --> 2:29:12.180
 when they form a pathway, it's a habit.

2:29:12.180 --> 2:29:16.140
 So if we're willing to talk about unconscious bias,

2:29:16.140 --> 2:29:18.500
 because of course it's very different

2:29:18.500 --> 2:29:20.900
 from somebody who tells me to my face,

2:29:21.940 --> 2:29:26.220
 there's no world in which you or I could ever be equal,

2:29:26.220 --> 2:29:27.540
 because you're black and I'm white,

2:29:27.540 --> 2:29:30.460
 you're a woman, I'm a man, this, this and that,

2:29:30.460 --> 2:29:35.460
 that people like that, again, 1% of psychopaths in our world,

2:29:35.460 --> 2:29:37.100
 they're out there, unfortunately,

2:29:37.100 --> 2:29:39.300
 by the time they do nasty things, it's pretty horrible,

2:29:39.300 --> 2:29:41.100
 and that's what all we hear about,

2:29:41.100 --> 2:29:42.860
 but I'm talking mostly about the rest of us.

2:29:42.860 --> 2:29:45.340
 Remember when I told you that most of us are good people,

2:29:45.340 --> 2:29:47.980
 bumbling along, making it up as we're going,

2:29:47.980 --> 2:29:50.660
 and that's why I have compassion for human nature.

2:29:50.660 --> 2:29:53.900
 So, but really, in the morning when I wake up,

2:29:53.900 --> 2:29:55.700
 do you really think that I'm waking up and thinking,

2:29:55.700 --> 2:29:56.700
 how am I gonna go kill?

2:29:56.700 --> 2:29:57.540
 How am I gonna kill?

2:29:57.540 --> 2:29:58.380
 How am I gonna kill?

2:29:58.380 --> 2:30:00.540
 And I wake up and thinking, how am I gonna go kill?

2:30:00.540 --> 2:30:01.860
 How am I gonna go kill Lex?

2:30:01.860 --> 2:30:04.660
 That Lex guy needs to go down, he's a man, he's a,

2:30:04.660 --> 2:30:05.860
 don't take me wrong, I'm sure there are some women

2:30:05.860 --> 2:30:07.660
 who feel like that, but I'm not one of them,

2:30:07.660 --> 2:30:10.500
 and I do think a majority of us are not, whatever.

2:30:10.500 --> 2:30:11.620
 But you know, in the morning I'm waking up,

2:30:11.620 --> 2:30:15.780
 I'm just like, gee, can I get my tea?

2:30:16.780 --> 2:30:18.540
 Oh, my dog is not looking okay today.

2:30:18.540 --> 2:30:22.420
 You know, we've got, right?

2:30:22.420 --> 2:30:26.060
 It's a lot going on, and so you're using these kind of,

2:30:26.060 --> 2:30:27.380
 just like you said, brilliantly,

2:30:27.380 --> 2:30:30.220
 it has a bunch of simplifications that's built up,

2:30:30.220 --> 2:30:32.820
 and it uses those simplifications to get through the day.

2:30:32.820 --> 2:30:34.500
 To get through the day, exactly.

2:30:34.500 --> 2:30:37.900
 So then here you are, needing to make sense of a world,

2:30:37.900 --> 2:30:39.860
 and then the brain is your best ally in that.

2:30:39.860 --> 2:30:41.420
 The way it's gonna do it is through efficiency,

2:30:41.420 --> 2:30:43.340
 efficiency done through automation.

2:30:43.340 --> 2:30:46.420
 So every time it thinks it's figured something out,

2:30:46.420 --> 2:30:47.780
 it's never gonna think about it again,

2:30:47.780 --> 2:30:49.780
 so that's how you build all of these habits

2:30:49.780 --> 2:30:52.300
 of unconscious bias, because everything,

2:30:52.300 --> 2:30:54.620
 so it's somewhere along the line,

2:30:54.620 --> 2:30:58.500
 you come up with the information

2:30:58.500 --> 2:31:01.660
 that black man walking around with a hoodie equals danger.

2:31:01.660 --> 2:31:03.180
 So later, what do you see?

2:31:04.900 --> 2:31:07.820
 Whether it's Lex or my gut, I'm walking in the dark alley,

2:31:07.820 --> 2:31:09.140
 I see a black man with a hoodie,

2:31:09.140 --> 2:31:10.060
 maybe I'm gonna run away

2:31:10.060 --> 2:31:12.940
 because I've been given that information.

2:31:12.940 --> 2:31:16.580
 So the best way to think about it is the brain is a hardware,

2:31:16.580 --> 2:31:21.580
 and the software it runs on is, what do you call it?

2:31:21.740 --> 2:31:24.380
 Is a cultural imprint.

2:31:24.380 --> 2:31:26.060
 All of this information that we're getting

2:31:26.060 --> 2:31:28.260
 from the Disney movies that you're reading,

2:31:28.260 --> 2:31:30.860
 telling you that damsels are to be saved by the prince

2:31:30.860 --> 2:31:34.420
 and all of that stuff, and girls wear pink and all, whatever.

2:31:34.420 --> 2:31:36.300
 You watch the movies, and all the movies,

2:31:36.300 --> 2:31:38.060
 whenever you watch images about Africa,

2:31:38.060 --> 2:31:39.500
 they're talking to you about the blood diamonds,

2:31:39.500 --> 2:31:40.740
 or they're talking to you about slavery,

2:31:40.740 --> 2:31:41.580
 or they're talking to you about this,

2:31:41.580 --> 2:31:42.860
 and then no wonder you walk away

2:31:42.860 --> 2:31:44.900
 thinking that all the ills of Africa are caused

2:31:44.900 --> 2:31:47.500
 because of resource extraction, the diamonds,

2:31:47.500 --> 2:31:49.380
 or they're always fighting each other,

2:31:49.380 --> 2:31:52.300
 look at Idi Amin in the movie,

2:31:52.300 --> 2:31:56.660
 or slavery all the time, you walk away and this is it.

2:31:56.660 --> 2:31:58.180
 And we all programmed along the same lines,

2:31:58.180 --> 2:31:59.820
 see that's the beauty of it.

2:31:59.820 --> 2:32:02.380
 All of us are, because even some black people

2:32:02.380 --> 2:32:04.300
 who are gonna claim that they didn't visit up

2:32:04.300 --> 2:32:06.620
 when they registered, really?

2:32:06.620 --> 2:32:08.540
 So the truth, so then when I learned all of this,

2:32:08.540 --> 2:32:11.300
 I'm like, wow, this concept of if you've got the brain,

2:32:11.300 --> 2:32:14.620
 you've got biases, it comes with the territory,

2:32:14.620 --> 2:32:15.700
 that makes sense.

2:32:16.580 --> 2:32:19.860
 Now, it doesn't mean we can't transcend

2:32:19.860 --> 2:32:22.820
 that function of a brain and that we should transcend it.

2:32:24.780 --> 2:32:25.820
 But I think it's very important

2:32:25.820 --> 2:32:27.700
 because once you understand that,

2:32:27.700 --> 2:32:30.300
 a little bit more peace is created among us

2:32:30.300 --> 2:32:32.020
 because this is not about a black and white,

2:32:32.020 --> 2:32:34.020
 or a yellow and green issue,

2:32:34.020 --> 2:32:36.900
 it's about we are human issue.

2:32:36.900 --> 2:32:41.900
 And these are part of things we develop to stay around.

2:32:42.980 --> 2:32:47.980
 Just like we no longer have to rely on this fear of flight,

2:32:47.980 --> 2:32:52.660
 like ability of a brain because bears over there

2:32:52.660 --> 2:32:54.860
 start running and running fast, right?

2:32:54.860 --> 2:32:55.740
 Today, where are the bears?

2:32:55.740 --> 2:32:56.820
 Show me where they are.

2:32:56.820 --> 2:33:01.820
 But we have kept this tendency to go for fear of flight.

2:33:02.420 --> 2:33:03.340
 I don't know how they say it.

2:33:03.340 --> 2:33:07.740
 And so we have this courtesan done by the stress,

2:33:07.740 --> 2:33:09.460
 stress triggers that back in the days,

2:33:09.460 --> 2:33:11.540
 we have a stress trigger, we run,

2:33:11.540 --> 2:33:14.140
 and it's all expelled out.

2:33:14.140 --> 2:33:15.900
 But today we get triggers

2:33:15.900 --> 2:33:17.140
 and we don't know what to do with it

2:33:17.140 --> 2:33:18.860
 because where do we run to?

2:33:18.860 --> 2:33:19.700
 What do we do?

2:33:19.700 --> 2:33:21.620
 The bear is not even here.

2:33:21.620 --> 2:33:23.340
 So same thing here with that.

2:33:23.340 --> 2:33:25.860
 And so then you realize there's this whole thing

2:33:25.860 --> 2:33:28.180
 that is now what you understand

2:33:28.180 --> 2:33:31.900
 is that this problem is not about anti racism BS,

2:33:31.900 --> 2:33:34.460
 but it is about can each one of us

2:33:34.460 --> 2:33:36.420
 do the work where the work is needed,

2:33:36.420 --> 2:33:38.540
 which is we look inside.

2:33:38.540 --> 2:33:41.660
 Can we go for this work of deprogrammation?

2:33:42.540 --> 2:33:45.340
 This concept of a mindful practice

2:33:45.340 --> 2:33:49.500
 of undoing the habit of bias.

2:33:49.500 --> 2:33:52.180
 And that doesn't necessarily have to do

2:33:52.180 --> 2:33:55.420
 with a simple categorization of black and white.

2:33:55.420 --> 2:33:56.420
 It's all kinds of biases.

2:33:56.420 --> 2:33:57.380
 It's about everything.

2:33:57.380 --> 2:33:58.860
 It's about everything.

2:33:58.860 --> 2:34:00.980
 And when I started on that journey

2:34:00.980 --> 2:34:03.820
 and my friend back then built this practice

2:34:03.820 --> 2:34:06.540
 of undoing your habit of unconscious bias,

2:34:08.500 --> 2:34:11.420
 we had all types of people come and say,

2:34:11.420 --> 2:34:16.060
 wow, I discovered that my bias is against larger people.

2:34:16.060 --> 2:34:17.980
 And I'm more like, what do you mean?

2:34:17.980 --> 2:34:21.900
 Well, I think it seems to me like I felt

2:34:21.900 --> 2:34:24.540
 that larger people maybe are dumb.

2:34:24.540 --> 2:34:28.060
 No, we heard things and you don't judge.

2:34:28.060 --> 2:34:28.900
 Yeah.

2:34:28.900 --> 2:34:29.740
 You don't judge.

2:34:29.740 --> 2:34:32.020
 And you see it's at every level.

2:34:33.700 --> 2:34:35.740
 I don't know, like there's even this one friend,

2:34:35.740 --> 2:34:37.700
 she was like, when I looked into the whole dating thing,

2:34:37.700 --> 2:34:40.460
 I absolutely didn't want to date the Asian men

2:34:40.460 --> 2:34:43.500
 because her mind was into some stereotypes

2:34:43.500 --> 2:34:45.460
 about the size of whatever.

2:34:45.460 --> 2:34:47.340
 And she was like, no.

2:34:47.340 --> 2:34:50.060
 But you see, once you start,

2:34:50.060 --> 2:34:51.420
 because there's this whole thing of,

2:34:51.420 --> 2:34:54.180
 it's the five step thing, bias awareness.

2:34:54.180 --> 2:34:57.260
 This, basically at this level,

2:34:57.260 --> 2:34:59.900
 what you're doing is you're learning

2:34:59.900 --> 2:35:02.060
 to spot the biases in our culture,

2:35:02.060 --> 2:35:04.420
 because that's where the cultural imprint comes from.

2:35:04.420 --> 2:35:05.900
 You're watching this movie and you're realizing,

2:35:05.900 --> 2:35:08.340
 just like I said, wow, gee, I realized once again,

2:35:08.340 --> 2:35:11.220
 the black person is portrayed like the fog of a movie.

2:35:12.300 --> 2:35:15.300
 Or, you know, the Latina lady,

2:35:15.300 --> 2:35:16.660
 this is how she's been portrayed.

2:35:16.660 --> 2:35:17.540
 And you see it everywhere.

2:35:17.540 --> 2:35:19.900
 Even the NPR, NPR is happening,

2:35:19.900 --> 2:35:21.620
 like you're listening to something like NPR.

2:35:21.620 --> 2:35:23.620
 It's gotta be more liberal than that.

2:35:23.620 --> 2:35:26.140
 And this gentleman is asking these two candidates,

2:35:26.140 --> 2:35:27.860
 one of them is a woman, political candidates,

2:35:27.860 --> 2:35:29.060
 the other one is a man.

2:35:29.060 --> 2:35:31.020
 I'm hearing him asking the lady a question

2:35:31.020 --> 2:35:33.700
 that I know he's not gonna ask the man and he didn't ask her.

2:35:33.700 --> 2:35:38.700
 He said, how do you balance your race with a family?

2:35:40.140 --> 2:35:41.940
 Does a man not have a family?

2:35:41.940 --> 2:35:46.100
 Right there, you see, it's very subtle.

2:35:46.100 --> 2:35:48.980
 But you see, but because now my mind is kind of trained

2:35:48.980 --> 2:35:51.220
 to see things, I'm like, interesting.

2:35:51.220 --> 2:35:53.260
 Or like when the media just says,

2:35:53.260 --> 2:35:57.620
 froze climate change issue on something

2:35:57.620 --> 2:35:59.900
 without even the choice of words.

2:35:59.900 --> 2:36:01.620
 So it's pretty much everywhere.

2:36:01.620 --> 2:36:03.140
 You open a book everywhere.

2:36:03.140 --> 2:36:05.020
 The interesting thing though,

2:36:05.020 --> 2:36:08.260
 I mean, even that man, woman example,

2:36:08.260 --> 2:36:11.860
 is I think it's really powerful

2:36:11.860 --> 2:36:13.940
 to bring that bias to the surface,

2:36:13.940 --> 2:36:18.500
 but not let that lead to kind of fear and paralysis.

2:36:18.500 --> 2:36:20.940
 You should almost, I mean, that's where humor is,

2:36:20.940 --> 2:36:23.300
 make fun of it, bring it to the surface,

2:36:23.300 --> 2:36:25.740
 like acknowledge the fact that those things

2:36:25.740 --> 2:36:27.140
 are a part of the conversation.

2:36:27.140 --> 2:36:32.100
 And a lot of them are, it is, it's a cultural imprint

2:36:32.100 --> 2:36:33.220
 because it's part of culture.

2:36:33.220 --> 2:36:34.740
 And that might be, there could be,

2:36:34.740 --> 2:36:36.620
 I grew up in the Soviet Union

2:36:36.620 --> 2:36:40.260
 where the gender roles were stronger than in other places.

2:36:40.260 --> 2:36:41.260
 And that's part of the culture.

2:36:41.260 --> 2:36:44.340
 We have to acknowledge that this is how,

2:36:44.340 --> 2:36:46.580
 this is affecting how I think.

2:36:46.580 --> 2:36:49.100
 We might like how that works, we might not,

2:36:49.100 --> 2:36:52.020
 but we have to acknowledge it and not get,

2:36:52.020 --> 2:36:54.220
 make it part of humor, make fun of yourself,

2:36:54.220 --> 2:36:55.460
 all that kind of stuff.

2:36:55.460 --> 2:36:56.300
 That's the thing.

2:36:56.300 --> 2:37:00.140
 And so that's why this first step is bias awareness.

2:37:00.140 --> 2:37:02.300
 So you get, you train yourself, oh yeah, okay,

2:37:02.300 --> 2:37:05.020
 that was one or it's, you know, and it's about,

2:37:05.020 --> 2:37:07.180
 it's in you, we're talking about you, we're not.

2:37:07.180 --> 2:37:11.500
 And then from there, you're like replace the bias,

2:37:11.500 --> 2:37:12.660
 like bias replacement.

2:37:13.940 --> 2:37:17.380
 Then it is where you practice the empathy.

2:37:17.380 --> 2:37:19.700
 You're like, gee, wow, I wonder how I would feel

2:37:19.700 --> 2:37:21.260
 every day I walk into a store

2:37:21.260 --> 2:37:22.740
 and the guy thinks he should be following me

2:37:22.740 --> 2:37:25.700
 because maybe I might steal something because I'm black.

2:37:25.700 --> 2:37:27.180
 Because once you try that,

2:37:27.180 --> 2:37:28.660
 to put yourself in the other person's shoes,

2:37:28.660 --> 2:37:31.220
 all of a sudden something else starts to click.

2:37:31.220 --> 2:37:35.220
 And then from there, you go on to making connection.

2:37:36.220 --> 2:37:37.820
 Then you're making a connection

2:37:37.820 --> 2:37:42.020
 and then things start to change because now you know,

2:37:42.020 --> 2:37:45.140
 you're making, then you make cultural immersion.

2:37:45.140 --> 2:37:47.100
 So this is where we had some people like this one woman,

2:37:47.100 --> 2:37:51.540
 she was very quite, very feminist oriented.

2:37:51.540 --> 2:37:56.020
 And she had an issue with women wearing the hijab.

2:37:56.020 --> 2:37:58.060
 And because for her it was like, how come you,

2:37:58.060 --> 2:38:02.340
 how come, how come you just lower, you know,

2:38:02.340 --> 2:38:06.300
 like how come you're accepting this demeaning of yourself,

2:38:06.300 --> 2:38:09.620
 not understanding everything else that comes with it.

2:38:09.620 --> 2:38:13.580
 But through, as she understood that she even had that bias,

2:38:13.580 --> 2:38:15.980
 then she went on through all the different processes.

2:38:15.980 --> 2:38:18.220
 And then eventually when comes the next step,

2:38:18.220 --> 2:38:21.740
 cultural immersion, she started going to the mosque

2:38:21.740 --> 2:38:24.300
 during Ramadan when the Muslims are doing, you know,

2:38:24.300 --> 2:38:27.020
 they're, it's the holy month of, you know, fasting

2:38:27.020 --> 2:38:28.900
 and then we break at night.

2:38:29.780 --> 2:38:32.340
 And she started understanding very different things.

2:38:32.340 --> 2:38:35.740
 And eventually happens the last step that happens naturally,

2:38:35.740 --> 2:38:38.820
 making a true, real, genuine connection.

2:38:38.820 --> 2:38:40.740
 And this is where friendships happen.

2:38:40.740 --> 2:38:43.220
 This is where that's it, your bias can go home now

2:38:43.220 --> 2:38:46.220
 because it has been challenged with reality

2:38:46.220 --> 2:38:47.380
 and understanding.

2:38:47.380 --> 2:38:51.340
 And so for me, that is what I was after.

2:38:51.340 --> 2:38:53.700
 And then, but then the world was just like,

2:38:53.700 --> 2:38:55.820
 we don't want to be told we're part of a problem.

2:38:55.820 --> 2:38:59.180
 So, but I still reckon that it is the type of mindfulness,

2:38:59.180 --> 2:39:00.620
 type of practice that's going to need to happen.

2:39:00.620 --> 2:39:04.180
 And it's one that's very internal to you.

2:39:04.180 --> 2:39:08.580
 It is not, and it happens, everybody at their own pace.

2:39:08.580 --> 2:39:13.580
 So all of this, I take it back to the racism,

2:39:13.980 --> 2:39:15.580
 the question you were asking me.

2:39:16.580 --> 2:39:17.420
 Does racism exist?

2:39:17.420 --> 2:39:18.460
 Yes, it does.

2:39:18.460 --> 2:39:20.260
 Is it going to stop me from doing anything I want to do?

2:39:20.260 --> 2:39:21.100
 No.

2:39:21.100 --> 2:39:21.940
 Is it going to make it harder?

2:39:21.940 --> 2:39:22.900
 No.

2:39:22.900 --> 2:39:27.420
 But this is where, for anybody who is serious

2:39:27.420 --> 2:39:31.980
 about making sure, about fighting racism,

2:39:33.860 --> 2:39:38.860
 I think the only job you have to do is to make sure

2:39:39.060 --> 2:39:41.860
 that people keep their sense of self agency

2:39:43.020 --> 2:39:46.300
 and B, can you help provide people with the tools

2:39:47.340 --> 2:39:48.940
 to stand up?

2:39:48.940 --> 2:39:52.500
 So this is why I have so much respect for Van Jones.

2:39:52.500 --> 2:39:54.100
 People like Van Jones,

2:39:54.100 --> 2:39:56.220
 although I disagree with him on so many things,

2:39:56.220 --> 2:40:00.380
 but people like Ms. Alice Johnson,

2:40:00.380 --> 2:40:02.980
 she was pardoned by President Trump

2:40:02.980 --> 2:40:05.420
 through the work of people like Van Jones

2:40:05.420 --> 2:40:08.060
 and Kim Kardashian and others.

2:40:08.060 --> 2:40:09.700
 They all joined forces.

2:40:09.700 --> 2:40:11.580
 This is a case where people of,

2:40:11.580 --> 2:40:16.580
 and those folks then went on to combine forces furthermore,

2:40:16.940 --> 2:40:21.140
 no regard given to their political belongings.

2:40:21.140 --> 2:40:25.700
 They said, if the issue is criminal justice reform,

2:40:25.700 --> 2:40:29.420
 then anybody who stands for it has to come together.

2:40:29.420 --> 2:40:31.660
 And so what they did in this situation

2:40:31.660 --> 2:40:34.740
 with what they're doing,

2:40:34.740 --> 2:40:37.060
 criminal justice reform in my mind

2:40:37.060 --> 2:40:42.060
 is a valid action to fight racism in my mind.

2:40:43.540 --> 2:40:44.980
 Because what are you doing there?

2:40:44.980 --> 2:40:47.020
 You're trying to get people out of jail

2:40:47.020 --> 2:40:49.460
 who really have no business being there.

2:40:49.460 --> 2:40:52.660
 And also when you have people like Bishop Omar

2:40:52.660 --> 2:40:55.180
 and the people, he passed away, unfortunately,

2:40:55.180 --> 2:40:57.860
 but today we have Anton Lucky,

2:40:57.860 --> 2:41:01.860
 who was in jail for having killed his cousin.

2:41:01.860 --> 2:41:04.300
 He had started,

2:41:04.300 --> 2:41:08.900
 I think he started the gang in South Dallas.

2:41:08.900 --> 2:41:10.340
 So we're talking really tough guy

2:41:10.340 --> 2:41:13.340
 who was reading the wrong side of the equation.

2:41:13.340 --> 2:41:16.580
 And then in jail, literally he found Plato,

2:41:16.580 --> 2:41:17.860
 the cave and all that.

2:41:17.860 --> 2:41:21.060
 So today these people, I'm like,

2:41:21.060 --> 2:41:22.380
 why don't we hear more about them?

2:41:22.380 --> 2:41:23.900
 The urban specialists.

2:41:23.900 --> 2:41:25.260
 Because these people,

2:41:25.260 --> 2:41:28.300
 it's not about the anti racism crap of Candy O'Donoghue,

2:41:28.300 --> 2:41:30.620
 I'll say it again, until the cows come home,

2:41:30.620 --> 2:41:33.220
 but it is about, we go where help is needed.

2:41:33.220 --> 2:41:37.740
 We go in urban, inner city,

2:41:37.740 --> 2:41:40.260
 inner city, black inner city neighborhoods

2:41:40.260 --> 2:41:43.340
 and block by block we change the culture.

2:41:43.340 --> 2:41:45.540
 And they say it like that, it's their words.

2:41:45.540 --> 2:41:47.100
 These are African American people

2:41:47.100 --> 2:41:48.700
 who have as many rights as anybody else

2:41:48.700 --> 2:41:50.180
 to talk about their own culture.

2:41:50.180 --> 2:41:53.740
 And they will tell you, we have to change the culture.

2:41:53.740 --> 2:41:55.860
 I have some videos like that on my YouTube

2:41:55.860 --> 2:41:57.580
 with Bishop Omar.

2:41:57.580 --> 2:41:59.980
 What these people are doing is what we need to do.

2:41:59.980 --> 2:42:01.220
 Bishop will explain and say,

2:42:01.220 --> 2:42:05.020
 sometimes people are their feet and feet

2:42:05.020 --> 2:42:06.460
 deep down in the mud.

2:42:07.340 --> 2:42:11.260
 And what we have to do is to try to pull them up.

2:42:11.260 --> 2:42:13.540
 And you cannot say you didn't pull them up

2:42:13.540 --> 2:42:15.300
 because we're not seeing their head out yet,

2:42:15.300 --> 2:42:18.580
 but how much progress have they made from the bottom

2:42:18.580 --> 2:42:22.180
 to where they are now and keep going.

2:42:22.180 --> 2:42:24.500
 So what I see these people doing,

2:42:24.500 --> 2:42:26.340
 you see, I have so much,

2:42:26.340 --> 2:42:29.340
 I love and respect Glen Lowry and company,

2:42:29.340 --> 2:42:30.660
 and Ian Rove and all of those guys.

2:42:30.660 --> 2:42:31.620
 I love them.

2:42:31.620 --> 2:42:34.220
 I love a lot of the things that they say.

2:42:36.220 --> 2:42:37.700
 This whole concept of personal responsibility,

2:42:37.700 --> 2:42:38.900
 we don't know that.

2:42:38.900 --> 2:42:40.300
 But I'm just like, at some point,

2:42:40.300 --> 2:42:43.740
 it also needs to be matched up with real actions.

2:42:43.740 --> 2:42:46.700
 And that's what the people like Anton Lucky,

2:42:46.700 --> 2:42:50.100
 urban specialist, Alice Johnson are doing.

2:42:50.100 --> 2:42:51.180
 They're going where it's hard.

2:42:51.180 --> 2:42:52.820
 Alice Johnson is getting people out of jail

2:42:52.820 --> 2:42:54.820
 every single day, literally.

2:42:54.820 --> 2:42:57.420
 And then people like Anton Lucky and his team

2:42:57.420 --> 2:43:01.100
 are giving them the tools to live the gang life,

2:43:01.100 --> 2:43:05.260
 to be better people, to go for a life of redemption.

2:43:05.260 --> 2:43:07.100
 This is happening right now.

2:43:07.100 --> 2:43:08.580
 But what I find is they're not getting

2:43:08.580 --> 2:43:10.260
 the bulk of the attention.

2:43:10.260 --> 2:43:14.420
 But anybody who's serious about this is why,

2:43:14.420 --> 2:43:17.300
 how I would love to see people do anti racism

2:43:17.300 --> 2:43:21.460
 is help lift people up for real.

2:43:21.460 --> 2:43:22.300
 Action.

2:43:22.300 --> 2:43:25.940
 Support school choice.

2:43:26.980 --> 2:43:28.140
 Support school choice.

2:43:28.140 --> 2:43:30.820
 Black mamas, they know what's going on.

2:43:30.820 --> 2:43:32.860
 And when they tell you we want school choice,

2:43:32.860 --> 2:43:33.700
 they know what to talk about.

2:43:33.700 --> 2:43:35.420
 They're not idiots.

2:43:35.420 --> 2:43:36.940
 Especially at the local level.

2:43:36.940 --> 2:43:37.780
 Yes.

2:43:37.780 --> 2:43:38.820
 Helping them at the local level.

2:43:38.820 --> 2:43:39.660
 Yes.

2:43:39.660 --> 2:43:42.780
 So help them make sure that they can take their kids

2:43:42.780 --> 2:43:45.900
 out of these public schools that are doing

2:43:45.900 --> 2:43:47.580
 horrendous things to them.

2:43:47.580 --> 2:43:50.380
 You know, Miss Virginia, watch that movie.

2:43:50.380 --> 2:43:55.100
 How could you not support black moms in this country

2:43:55.100 --> 2:43:57.580
 to take the kids to safety when it comes to education?

2:43:57.580 --> 2:43:59.060
 How come not?

2:43:59.060 --> 2:44:00.780
 That's what I want to see happen.

2:44:00.780 --> 2:44:04.500
 And not like some, yeah, let's go to some classrooms

2:44:04.500 --> 2:44:05.740
 and everybody's white.

2:44:05.740 --> 2:44:06.660
 You go over here.

2:44:06.660 --> 2:44:07.900
 Everybody's a next date.

2:44:07.900 --> 2:44:08.900
 You go over here.

2:44:08.900 --> 2:44:10.580
 And kids, let us tell you about this.

2:44:10.580 --> 2:44:13.220
 No, no, no, no.

2:44:13.220 --> 2:44:15.860
 As a black person, I don't want you to do any of that crap.

2:44:17.500 --> 2:44:19.460
 Let me grow my wings.

2:44:19.460 --> 2:44:20.300
 Yeah.

2:44:20.300 --> 2:44:22.180
 If you want, help put some fuel behind them

2:44:22.180 --> 2:44:23.500
 and let me take my flight.

2:44:23.500 --> 2:44:24.740
 That's all I'm asking for.

2:44:24.740 --> 2:44:29.740
 That's the only way for you to be part of a racism battle

2:44:30.380 --> 2:44:32.140
 if that's what you think is the most important battle

2:44:32.140 --> 2:44:33.380
 of our life.

2:44:33.380 --> 2:44:34.220
 That's it.

2:44:34.220 --> 2:44:35.340
 That's what I have to say about that.

2:44:35.340 --> 2:44:37.580
 And so for me, I'm keeping my head very straight.

2:44:37.580 --> 2:44:42.580
 It's about what enables black people to thrive.

2:44:45.300 --> 2:44:48.980
 I don't need for you to be an activist on my behalf.

2:44:48.980 --> 2:44:50.380
 No, because when you're doing that,

2:44:50.380 --> 2:44:52.740
 you're doing exactly what you've been doing to us

2:44:52.740 --> 2:44:55.140
 black people in Africa our whole life.

2:44:55.140 --> 2:44:56.900
 I don't need your white savior complex

2:44:56.900 --> 2:44:58.380
 because that's what anti racism is.

2:44:58.380 --> 2:44:59.340
 White savior complex.

2:44:59.340 --> 2:45:00.620
 That stuff doesn't work.

2:45:00.620 --> 2:45:02.620
 It only works to make you feel better

2:45:02.620 --> 2:45:04.340
 about how superior you are to me.

2:45:04.340 --> 2:45:06.980
 But it does nothing, absolutely nothing

2:45:06.980 --> 2:45:08.380
 to change my everyday life.

2:45:08.380 --> 2:45:11.220
 If it is not, if it is at least in the African side

2:45:11.220 --> 2:45:13.580
 to actually even change my,

2:45:14.740 --> 2:45:17.500
 turn me into somebody who's waiting for handouts.

2:45:17.500 --> 2:45:20.780
 So I would encourage people to really,

2:45:20.780 --> 2:45:22.980
 those people who are really serious

2:45:22.980 --> 2:45:24.540
 about wanting to be part of a solution.

2:45:24.540 --> 2:45:26.420
 And I know there are many out there

2:45:26.420 --> 2:45:28.460
 for the love of God and everything that's out there

2:45:28.460 --> 2:45:31.460
 and we care about, stop.

2:45:31.460 --> 2:45:36.460
 It's about, think about what's gonna enable people.

2:45:39.100 --> 2:45:40.620
 Maybe the word is wrongly chosen,

2:45:40.620 --> 2:45:42.300
 but know what I'm talking about.

2:45:42.300 --> 2:45:44.940
 Give them the freedom to spread their wings.

2:45:44.940 --> 2:45:49.020
 Yes, give a person, teach a person how to fish

2:45:49.020 --> 2:45:50.660
 and don't give them a fish.

2:45:50.660 --> 2:45:53.020
 When you're putting your stupid signs on the lawn

2:45:53.020 --> 2:45:55.020
 with Black Lives Matter and all that crap,

2:45:55.020 --> 2:45:55.980
 you're not helping.

2:45:55.980 --> 2:45:58.420
 And when you're buying one more anti racism book

2:45:58.420 --> 2:46:02.860
 or as a company, financing one more DEI,

2:46:04.060 --> 2:46:06.940
 if it done along those lines, I think we've got a problem.

2:46:06.940 --> 2:46:07.780
 Yeah.

2:46:07.780 --> 2:46:11.980
 So you do think that the efforts of diversity,

2:46:11.980 --> 2:46:16.220
 equity and inclusion are often not effective.

2:46:16.220 --> 2:46:17.300
 Not only are they not effective,

2:46:17.300 --> 2:46:20.380
 but they also backfire and there are reports on all of this.

2:46:22.700 --> 2:46:25.420
 And at the end of the day, it makes sense.

2:46:25.420 --> 2:46:26.740
 It makes sense.

2:46:26.740 --> 2:46:29.700
 So for me, I am very, very glad

2:46:29.700 --> 2:46:34.140
 that people have developed an enlightenment about this.

2:46:35.140 --> 2:46:37.540
 Very happy about that, very.

2:46:37.540 --> 2:46:39.420
 But let us not keep going

2:46:39.420 --> 2:46:44.100
 for the easy perceived solution to problems.

2:46:44.100 --> 2:46:47.900
 Again, they've done this to us, the poor people of Africa.

2:46:47.900 --> 2:46:51.860
 They thought the solution was to give.

2:46:51.860 --> 2:46:53.900
 It does not work.

2:46:53.900 --> 2:46:58.900
 And then they say, oh, we're gonna do social entrepreneurship

2:46:59.020 --> 2:47:00.740
 on you, Tom shoes, buy one pair of shoes

2:47:00.740 --> 2:47:01.980
 and we give one pair of shoes

2:47:01.980 --> 2:47:04.540
 to some people in poor countries.

2:47:04.540 --> 2:47:06.140
 Then guess what happened to us?

2:47:07.180 --> 2:47:09.300
 You know, in the town where we operate in Senegal,

2:47:09.300 --> 2:47:11.100
 where I have my little manufacturing,

2:47:12.660 --> 2:47:15.940
 we have 2000 little mom and pop businesses.

2:47:15.940 --> 2:47:18.620
 And guess what they happen to be in Lex?

2:47:18.620 --> 2:47:21.340
 Shoemakers, right?

2:47:21.340 --> 2:47:24.180
 So every shoemakers, each one of them hires

2:47:24.180 --> 2:47:26.180
 at least five, 15 people.

2:47:26.180 --> 2:47:29.300
 Do the math, family businesses.

2:47:30.580 --> 2:47:34.420
 Guess what happens to them the day the Tom shoes truck

2:47:34.420 --> 2:47:36.580
 shows up with bunch of free shoes.

2:47:39.140 --> 2:47:39.980
 Yeah.

2:47:39.980 --> 2:47:42.260
 Who can compete against free?

2:47:42.260 --> 2:47:43.620
 Now, all of these people,

2:47:43.620 --> 2:47:45.260
 little by little gonna have to close their shops

2:47:45.260 --> 2:47:46.740
 because who can compete against free

2:47:46.740 --> 2:47:49.620
 because Tom shoes dumping all of his shoes on them.

2:47:49.620 --> 2:47:50.540
 And then they go out of business

2:47:50.540 --> 2:47:53.220
 and now instead of helping anybody,

2:47:53.220 --> 2:47:54.980
 you actually sent all the kids

2:47:54.980 --> 2:47:59.020
 who depended on these adults working in these places.

2:47:59.020 --> 2:48:00.460
 Now they have to join the rank of kids

2:48:00.460 --> 2:48:01.820
 who need to be given shoes

2:48:01.820 --> 2:48:05.780
 because you took their parents ability

2:48:05.780 --> 2:48:10.420
 to make money through their wages, buy them shoes.

2:48:11.460 --> 2:48:12.300
 You see?

2:48:12.300 --> 2:48:14.140
 So first they said, we just have to give.

2:48:14.140 --> 2:48:19.100
 So that was primarily, you know, the charity business.

2:48:19.100 --> 2:48:22.620
 And you still have foreign aid business going on.

2:48:22.620 --> 2:48:24.380
 So we just need to give.

2:48:24.380 --> 2:48:27.460
 And then the social entrepreneurs came in place,

2:48:27.460 --> 2:48:29.780
 but I'm like, the only person for this business is good

2:48:29.780 --> 2:48:32.700
 is for Blake McCarthy, you know, the founder of Tom shoes.

2:48:32.700 --> 2:48:34.820
 But other than that, I'm not sure really seeing

2:48:34.820 --> 2:48:36.580
 who else is winning from this.

2:48:36.580 --> 2:48:39.660
 And then they, and so today my whole thing is

2:48:41.100 --> 2:48:46.100
 we got a challenge to have a mind for the poor

2:48:46.100 --> 2:48:49.060
 or to have a mind for the lesser fortunate,

2:48:49.060 --> 2:48:52.260
 maybe in this country, it is easy.

2:48:52.260 --> 2:48:53.980
 And lesser fortunate, you know,

2:48:53.980 --> 2:48:57.180
 for anybody that you feel like is being trampled upon

2:48:57.180 --> 2:48:58.100
 because of something,

2:48:58.100 --> 2:49:00.660
 maybe it's because of economic circumstances,

2:49:00.660 --> 2:49:02.740
 or maybe it's race in this case, whatever.

2:49:04.540 --> 2:49:08.100
 To have a heart for the lesser fortunate among us,

2:49:08.100 --> 2:49:12.580
 for whatever reason, that's easy.

2:49:12.580 --> 2:49:16.860
 But to have a mind for them, that's the challenge.

2:49:16.860 --> 2:49:18.540
 Let me ask you a difficult question.

2:49:18.540 --> 2:49:19.500
 Yeah.

2:49:19.500 --> 2:49:22.700
 As if we were not already asking difficult questions.

2:49:22.700 --> 2:49:26.620
 The president of Senegal, Macky Saw,

2:49:26.620 --> 2:49:29.820
 is also now the chair of the African Union.

2:49:29.820 --> 2:49:34.340
 He met with the president of Vladimir Putin on June 3rd.

2:49:35.180 --> 2:49:40.300
 I think primarily was to discuss food security.

2:49:40.300 --> 2:49:45.300
 Africa seems to be split halfway on their perspective

2:49:45.380 --> 2:49:46.820
 in the war in Ukraine.

2:49:46.820 --> 2:49:50.620
 So broadly speaking, what do you think about this?

2:49:51.620 --> 2:49:53.700
 First of all, the geopolitics of Africa

2:49:54.700 --> 2:49:58.260
 and the geopolitical relationship of Africa

2:49:58.260 --> 2:50:01.780
 with the rest of the world and this current conflict

2:50:03.340 --> 2:50:05.420
 with the war in Ukraine.

2:50:05.420 --> 2:50:06.980
 What are your thoughts there?

2:50:06.980 --> 2:50:09.500
 Well, you've seen that many countries

2:50:09.500 --> 2:50:12.980
 when it was time to vote, some of them abstained,

2:50:12.980 --> 2:50:15.580
 which in a way says something.

2:50:15.580 --> 2:50:17.780
 I think for the Africans today,

2:50:17.780 --> 2:50:20.100
 especially as represented by the African Union,

2:50:20.100 --> 2:50:22.900
 because not all countries fall along the same lines,

2:50:23.980 --> 2:50:27.100
 I feel like, again, we're back to way back.

2:50:27.100 --> 2:50:30.860
 For the longest time, the West tries to tell us what to do.

2:50:30.860 --> 2:50:32.780
 They decide for us.

2:50:32.780 --> 2:50:37.420
 And here, there's trouble,

2:50:37.420 --> 2:50:42.300
 meaning there's definitely a rift, major one,

2:50:42.300 --> 2:50:44.300
 between most of the Western world

2:50:44.300 --> 2:50:48.020
 as represented by Europe and America primarily,

2:50:48.020 --> 2:50:49.820
 and you have Australia and all that.

2:50:50.980 --> 2:50:53.140
 And then they're saying,

2:50:54.900 --> 2:50:56.900
 I think this is more or less an attempt

2:50:56.900 --> 2:51:01.900
 to stand on their own as well.

2:51:03.220 --> 2:51:07.220
 It's like, don't tell us what to do as usual.

2:51:07.220 --> 2:51:09.700
 You always rope us in with, when it makes sense for you,

2:51:09.700 --> 2:51:10.820
 you try to rope us in,

2:51:10.820 --> 2:51:13.020
 and then we're left hanging on our own.

2:51:13.020 --> 2:51:15.020
 So this goes back to the sentiment

2:51:15.020 --> 2:51:16.820
 you were talking about earlier.

2:51:16.820 --> 2:51:21.820
 It's been challenging for me to watch this

2:51:22.500 --> 2:51:26.500
 because remember, I have one foot also,

2:51:26.500 --> 2:51:28.700
 because there's what I get to see and hear

2:51:29.660 --> 2:51:31.860
 from being in the Western world,

2:51:31.860 --> 2:51:34.260
 but there's also what I get to see and hear

2:51:34.260 --> 2:51:37.060
 from when I'm back home.

2:51:37.060 --> 2:51:38.740
 So I wear all hats.

2:51:39.660 --> 2:51:41.700
 And I think this is a situation

2:51:41.700 --> 2:51:46.700
 where the African Union and African nations in general

2:51:47.540 --> 2:51:52.540
 are saying, this is a case where almost like,

2:51:52.740 --> 2:51:56.580
 you guys are fighting, you guys are fighting.

2:51:56.580 --> 2:51:59.500
 Maybe for once, we have to watch out for ourselves.

2:51:59.500 --> 2:52:04.500
 Yeah, there's a sense in which this is the embodiment

2:52:04.500 --> 2:52:08.380
 sort of abstaining from a vote on the war in Ukraine

2:52:09.700 --> 2:52:12.980
 is a political embodiment of a resistance

2:52:12.980 --> 2:52:14.900
 to the influence of the West.

2:52:14.900 --> 2:52:16.860
 It's not about the war between,

2:52:16.860 --> 2:52:18.460
 whatever you guys are fighting.

2:52:18.460 --> 2:52:23.460
 It's saying, we're not going to let this particular empire

2:52:24.940 --> 2:52:26.940
 that seems to be at the top right now,

2:52:26.940 --> 2:52:29.460
 which is the United States empire in Europe,

2:52:30.340 --> 2:52:33.780
 to dominate our political discourse,

2:52:33.780 --> 2:52:36.580
 our geopolitical considerations.

2:52:36.580 --> 2:52:38.940
 It's almost like, no, we're not touching this.

2:52:38.940 --> 2:52:40.820
 Yeah, especially that given usually.

2:52:40.820 --> 2:52:43.860
 So when they need us, again, for influence,

2:52:43.860 --> 2:52:45.260
 which means more power,

2:52:45.260 --> 2:52:47.740
 oh, you guys vote the same way we do.

2:52:47.740 --> 2:52:52.740
 And when it's all over and they go back to spreading,

2:52:52.900 --> 2:52:54.420
 they go back to, how do you say that?

2:52:54.420 --> 2:52:59.180
 They go back to exchanging and sharing between themselves

2:52:59.180 --> 2:53:03.900
 the goodies of their Halloween collection.

2:53:03.900 --> 2:53:05.380
 We're no longer, we're not there

2:53:05.380 --> 2:53:07.580
 when the goodies are being shared.

2:53:07.580 --> 2:53:11.540
 So I think it's definitely one of those situations.

2:53:11.540 --> 2:53:14.540
 But for me, it still is hard

2:53:14.540 --> 2:53:17.020
 because I watch everything that's going on

2:53:18.460 --> 2:53:23.260
 and it's going to be complicated,

2:53:23.260 --> 2:53:25.260
 the ramifications of all of this.

2:53:25.260 --> 2:53:28.660
 I would like to see our African leaders also,

2:53:28.660 --> 2:53:30.500
 what they're doing is clear,

2:53:30.500 --> 2:53:33.980
 but this is a place where I'm also tempted to say,

2:53:35.820 --> 2:53:36.660
 yes and.

2:53:39.340 --> 2:53:42.380
 Yes to the reasons you're advancing right now,

2:53:44.180 --> 2:53:47.220
 we don't want to be always siding because we're tired.

2:53:47.220 --> 2:53:49.460
 We're tired of always being dragged around

2:53:49.460 --> 2:53:51.940
 and taken for granted and you vote our way.

2:53:53.020 --> 2:53:55.580
 Come on guys, when you need us,

2:53:55.580 --> 2:53:57.260
 we're great and everything is good.

2:53:57.260 --> 2:53:59.660
 And then when it's time to go and share the goodies,

2:53:59.660 --> 2:54:01.180
 we don't exist anymore.

2:54:01.180 --> 2:54:04.580
 And you actually go for policies that go against us.

2:54:04.580 --> 2:54:06.420
 But in this situation though,

2:54:07.260 --> 2:54:09.820
 I would like to still see us do the right thing.

2:54:09.820 --> 2:54:14.820
 In my case, I was not very happy to see us going

2:54:15.260 --> 2:54:17.340
 and more or less begging for,

2:54:20.180 --> 2:54:21.300
 what do you call it?

2:54:21.300 --> 2:54:26.180
 Cereals, oh, please let the cereals make it.

2:54:26.180 --> 2:54:29.180
 So at least we get them and we don't starve.

2:54:29.180 --> 2:54:32.660
 I can understand why a president would say something

2:54:32.660 --> 2:54:35.460
 like that or try to negotiate something like that.

2:54:36.500 --> 2:54:41.300
 But when it comes to an African president having to do that

2:54:41.300 --> 2:54:45.380
 with a non African president, I'm sorry,

2:54:45.380 --> 2:54:47.860
 but for me, it's too close to begging.

2:54:47.860 --> 2:54:49.180
 Listen, it's hard to be a leader,

2:54:49.180 --> 2:54:52.180
 it's such a difficult dance because in some sense,

2:54:52.180 --> 2:54:57.180
 sort of the flip side of that is you're creating a market,

2:54:59.620 --> 2:55:01.740
 a geopolitical market of saying,

2:55:01.740 --> 2:55:05.460
 we're willing to sit down at the table with America,

2:55:05.460 --> 2:55:10.460
 with European leaders, with Russian leaders, with China,

2:55:10.900 --> 2:55:13.940
 and we're gonna let you guys convince us

2:55:13.940 --> 2:55:17.140
 who we should collaborate with.

2:55:17.140 --> 2:55:21.740
 And that's what sort of great nations

2:55:21.740 --> 2:55:23.580
 and groups of nations do.

2:55:23.580 --> 2:55:25.580
 Now, there's a cynical, of course,

2:55:25.580 --> 2:55:29.860
 a dark perspective on that because what's in that game

2:55:29.860 --> 2:55:32.260
 played by leaders, the people that hurt,

2:55:32.260 --> 2:55:36.420
 people of Ukraine hurt, people of Africa can hurt.

2:55:36.420 --> 2:55:37.340
 People of Russia.

2:55:37.340 --> 2:55:40.140
 People of Russia can hurt, people of China,

2:55:40.140 --> 2:55:44.940
 people of United States, but it is the way of the world.

2:55:44.940 --> 2:55:49.020
 And to earn, you have to earn respect

2:55:49.020 --> 2:55:52.300
 and sometimes earning respect leads to the suffering

2:55:52.300 --> 2:55:53.140
 of many.

2:55:53.140 --> 2:55:56.140
 Well, but except in this case, yes to all of that.

2:55:56.140 --> 2:55:59.820
 And the reason why I'm actually upset

2:55:59.820 --> 2:56:02.780
 with going and being like, oh, can you let at least

2:56:02.780 --> 2:56:05.100
 the boats that are supposed to come to Africa

2:56:05.100 --> 2:56:08.100
 full of cereals come over, the wheat and all that?

2:56:08.100 --> 2:56:11.540
 It's just like, look, Africa has the highest land

2:56:11.540 --> 2:56:13.220
 that you can do agriculture on.

2:56:13.220 --> 2:56:14.060
 Yes.

2:56:14.060 --> 2:56:14.900
 You know?

2:56:14.900 --> 2:56:19.100
 We have a larger surface, such surface in the world.

2:56:19.100 --> 2:56:21.500
 Why is this not a time for us to try

2:56:21.500 --> 2:56:24.420
 to win ourselves off of cereals that we don't necessarily

2:56:24.420 --> 2:56:26.420
 have on the ground?

2:56:26.420 --> 2:56:30.180
 But no, let us go and plead.

2:56:30.180 --> 2:56:31.900
 Don't beg, create instead.

2:56:31.900 --> 2:56:33.340
 Create instead, exactly.

2:56:33.340 --> 2:56:35.220
 This should have been, you know, just like how

2:56:35.220 --> 2:56:38.020
 the rest of the world when COVID happened

2:56:38.020 --> 2:56:40.300
 and China had to close off for different reasons

2:56:40.300 --> 2:56:42.620
 and since then has not, you know, completely reopened

2:56:42.620 --> 2:56:44.940
 and people have started to realize, wow,

2:56:44.940 --> 2:56:48.660
 we've got too much, we're too dependent on China

2:56:48.660 --> 2:56:50.620
 for a lot of what we need.

2:56:50.620 --> 2:56:53.060
 So we're gonna have to bring back some production

2:56:53.060 --> 2:56:56.220
 to the US, the Europeans are doing the same, all of that.

2:56:56.220 --> 2:56:59.300
 This should have been a time for African leaders

2:56:59.300 --> 2:57:02.100
 to be like, we need to be serious now

2:57:02.100 --> 2:57:05.860
 about, you know, food security.

2:57:05.860 --> 2:57:08.380
 And maybe the stuff that maybe don't grow

2:57:08.380 --> 2:57:10.140
 under our climates necessarily,

2:57:10.140 --> 2:57:12.500
 can we work on coming up with different things?

2:57:12.500 --> 2:57:14.540
 Now I understand that it can take time,

2:57:14.540 --> 2:57:17.540
 but if I knew that that was happening at the same time

2:57:17.540 --> 2:57:20.260
 that we're saying, oh, well, let the cereals come in,

2:57:20.260 --> 2:57:22.260
 maybe I would be a little bit easier with it.

2:57:22.260 --> 2:57:23.740
 But right now I'm just like,

2:57:23.740 --> 2:57:25.580
 is it gonna be the same business as usual?

2:57:25.580 --> 2:57:27.660
 And in this case, I'm just like, are we gonna go,

2:57:27.660 --> 2:57:30.980
 are we gonna keep going from one masa to another masa?

2:57:30.980 --> 2:57:31.820
 I mean, really?

2:57:32.820 --> 2:57:35.100
 The interesting aspect of all of this

2:57:35.100 --> 2:57:37.020
 is if we look at all of human history,

2:57:37.020 --> 2:57:40.380
 it's possible that the 21st century is defined by Africa.

2:57:40.380 --> 2:57:41.820
 It will be.

2:57:41.820 --> 2:57:45.620
 And the young people, the huge number of young people,

2:57:45.620 --> 2:57:47.300
 it's like the trajectory could be,

2:57:47.300 --> 2:57:49.660
 there's so much possibility to define

2:57:49.660 --> 2:57:52.540
 the future of human civilization in Africa.

2:57:52.540 --> 2:57:55.460
 And I don't mean sort of in the next 10 years,

2:57:55.460 --> 2:57:57.460
 I mean in the next 50 years.

2:57:59.380 --> 2:58:03.260
 So some people are concerned about overpopulation.

2:58:03.260 --> 2:58:06.460
 Some people are concerned about us dying out

2:58:06.460 --> 2:58:07.740
 as a human species.

2:58:07.740 --> 2:58:12.260
 And both of those people live in us.

2:58:12.260 --> 2:58:13.460
 Talk to me often about that.

2:58:13.460 --> 2:58:18.460
 I know, I know, I know, I know who they are.

2:58:19.300 --> 2:58:22.700
 What's your, in Africa is at the center of this

2:58:22.700 --> 2:58:26.420
 because there is a vibrant, huge number,

2:58:26.420 --> 2:58:28.820
 probably over a billion people.

2:58:28.820 --> 2:58:30.540
 Yeah, we're 1.3 billion people

2:58:30.540 --> 2:58:33.460
 and of those, one billion blacks.

2:58:33.460 --> 2:58:36.740
 I mean that, where do you land on that?

2:58:36.740 --> 2:58:41.740
 There is a reason why I say I'm haunted,

2:58:41.860 --> 2:58:45.500
 that I'm obsessed, that I'm monomaniacal

2:58:45.500 --> 2:58:47.300
 when it comes to the free markets

2:58:47.300 --> 2:58:50.260
 and that I have such a strong sense of urgency

2:58:50.260 --> 2:58:53.660
 to the point that literally it is affecting me.

2:58:53.660 --> 2:58:56.060
 And it has to do with the fact that yes,

2:58:56.060 --> 2:58:58.500
 you have the youngest region on earth

2:58:58.500 --> 2:59:01.340
 in terms of the age of its population

2:59:01.340 --> 2:59:06.900
 and the rate at which it's growing demographic wise,

2:59:06.900 --> 2:59:10.100
 I am not willing to stay there and say,

2:59:10.100 --> 2:59:12.340
 it's a curse for humanity,

2:59:12.340 --> 2:59:15.020
 but it will be a curse for humanity

2:59:15.020 --> 2:59:20.460
 if we don't make sure that these people,

2:59:20.460 --> 2:59:25.980
 our youth gets to partake.

2:59:25.980 --> 2:59:29.020
 And what it takes to partake is not much.

2:59:29.020 --> 2:59:31.580
 So if the rest of the world thinks that

2:59:31.580 --> 2:59:35.060
 get to partake means you have to send more foreign aid,

2:59:35.060 --> 2:59:38.740
 you have to have more charity businesses,

2:59:38.740 --> 2:59:42.500
 I mean charity organizations sending stuff away,

2:59:42.500 --> 2:59:46.660
 of course, you're almost thinking parasites.

2:59:46.660 --> 2:59:48.180
 I'm sorry to say it this way,

2:59:48.180 --> 2:59:49.980
 if this is what you're thinking,

2:59:49.980 --> 2:59:52.980
 you're seeing us as no more than parasites.

2:59:52.980 --> 2:59:55.780
 And if that's what it's gonna be,

2:59:55.780 --> 2:59:59.380
 I could see why some people might be worried about that.

2:59:59.380 --> 3:00:04.260
 Although humans should never be seen as parasites,

3:00:04.260 --> 3:00:07.500
 no matter, no matter, no matter.

3:00:07.500 --> 3:00:09.940
 But some people will go there.

3:00:09.940 --> 3:00:14.340
 Now, people are here.

3:00:14.340 --> 3:00:16.580
 What are we gonna do, dispose of them?

3:00:16.580 --> 3:00:18.060
 That's not an option.

3:00:18.060 --> 3:00:20.420
 So the only option we have left

3:00:20.420 --> 3:00:22.060
 is to make sure that people partake.

3:00:22.060 --> 3:00:23.980
 And what partaking means is that

3:00:23.980 --> 3:00:26.740
 people get included in them

3:00:26.740 --> 3:00:31.740
 and are part of the systems that allow for human flourishing.

3:00:31.860 --> 3:00:33.820
 And it doesn't, it's not much.

3:00:33.820 --> 3:00:35.940
 In this case, it's about,

3:00:35.940 --> 3:00:38.820
 can we be serious about the reforms?

3:00:38.820 --> 3:00:41.780
 So we have free market zones,

3:00:41.780 --> 3:00:43.620
 areas where people,

3:00:43.620 --> 3:00:47.220
 where the flourishing can start to take place.

3:00:48.580 --> 3:00:52.660
 The wealth that people will need to flourish,

3:00:52.660 --> 3:00:55.260
 they don't need you to give it to them.

3:00:55.260 --> 3:00:58.580
 But it's all about, can I let you fly?

3:00:58.580 --> 3:01:01.620
 And you will make it happen for you and also for me.

3:01:02.500 --> 3:01:05.060
 Every young African I see today,

3:01:05.060 --> 3:01:07.820
 I realize how stupid the rest of the world is

3:01:07.820 --> 3:01:11.540
 if they're not supporting what I'm trying to talk about.

3:01:11.540 --> 3:01:13.140
 Cause even if you don't wanna do it

3:01:13.140 --> 3:01:14.020
 because that's the right thing to do,

3:01:14.020 --> 3:01:16.140
 which I think it is the right thing to do,

3:01:17.540 --> 3:01:20.580
 your selfishness, maybe engage your selfishness.

3:01:20.580 --> 3:01:21.940
 Cause this person right there,

3:01:21.940 --> 3:01:24.740
 remember I told you seven billion geniuses,

3:01:24.740 --> 3:01:26.340
 everybody came to this world

3:01:26.340 --> 3:01:30.500
 with a piece of solution to the human problem.

3:01:30.500 --> 3:01:33.180
 This person and that person and that person

3:01:34.260 --> 3:01:37.340
 hold something for me because I'm part of humanity.

3:01:37.340 --> 3:01:41.060
 This person might have a cure to a cancer

3:01:41.060 --> 3:01:44.340
 that might take my wife out, the wife I haven't met yet.

3:01:44.340 --> 3:01:47.540
 But this kid right here has it inside.

3:01:48.580 --> 3:01:50.300
 And if I help this,

3:01:50.300 --> 3:01:52.940
 if I make sure that this kid gets a chance to flourish

3:01:52.940 --> 3:01:56.460
 and to manifest his genius or her genius,

3:01:56.460 --> 3:01:59.260
 that trickle down many years later,

3:01:59.260 --> 3:02:03.060
 comes straight back to serve me and the love of my life.

3:02:03.060 --> 3:02:04.700
 If we can't see it any other way,

3:02:04.700 --> 3:02:07.020
 maybe let's try to think about it that way.

3:02:07.020 --> 3:02:10.220
 Cause it becomes a very good proposition at that point.

3:02:10.220 --> 3:02:13.100
 So in this case, by 2050,

3:02:13.100 --> 3:02:16.820
 Lagos, Nigeria will be the largest city in the world.

3:02:16.820 --> 3:02:19.820
 The future is African, whether we want it or not.

3:02:19.820 --> 3:02:22.500
 But is it going to be an African future

3:02:22.500 --> 3:02:25.700
 where you have a youth being a ticking bomb?

3:02:27.020 --> 3:02:30.500
 Because they have not, there's no hope.

3:02:30.500 --> 3:02:32.780
 They stay in poverty

3:02:32.780 --> 3:02:34.980
 because they belong to nations that don't even understand

3:02:34.980 --> 3:02:39.260
 sometimes the importance of common law versus civil law.

3:02:39.260 --> 3:02:43.060
 Because they're trapped in countries that don't understand

3:02:43.060 --> 3:02:46.860
 that you need to make the legal framework

3:02:46.860 --> 3:02:49.260
 to provide for better economic freedom.

3:02:49.260 --> 3:02:53.300
 So you can unleash the genuineness, the awesomeness,

3:02:53.300 --> 3:02:57.340
 the ingenuity, the industrious side of your young people,

3:02:57.340 --> 3:02:59.580
 especially of your women,

3:02:59.580 --> 3:03:01.140
 so that they build all the wealth

3:03:01.140 --> 3:03:03.380
 that your nation is gonna need you to build.

3:03:03.380 --> 3:03:05.660
 And with it, the respect that comes from that.

3:03:06.660 --> 3:03:08.220
 See, we have a choice to make.

3:03:08.220 --> 3:03:12.020
 And this is why I feel so, so, so restless about this

3:03:12.020 --> 3:03:14.260
 at this point of my life.

3:03:14.260 --> 3:03:15.860
 We just lost George Hayite.

3:03:17.140 --> 3:03:19.260
 George Hayite is one of the few Africans that I knew

3:03:19.260 --> 3:03:22.820
 who put this out.

3:03:22.820 --> 3:03:24.140
 That's who I learned from.

3:03:24.140 --> 3:03:25.860
 He's gone.

3:03:25.860 --> 3:03:29.580
 And I feel a strong sense of urgency

3:03:29.580 --> 3:03:32.340
 to not only bring back to the table

3:03:32.340 --> 3:03:34.340
 that which he has been working on,

3:03:35.420 --> 3:03:37.860
 but to also make sure that it gets seen.

3:03:37.860 --> 3:03:40.580
 That's why being here talking with you today,

3:03:40.580 --> 3:03:44.300
 it's, you have no idea.

3:03:44.300 --> 3:03:48.100
 It's, people ask, if someone like you could say,

3:03:48.100 --> 3:03:49.300
 what can I do?

3:03:49.300 --> 3:03:52.860
 You did more than you could ever imagine

3:03:52.860 --> 3:03:56.260
 by just allowing me to take this message to one more person.

3:03:57.380 --> 3:03:59.580
 And because if we do this,

3:04:00.940 --> 3:04:03.220
 the change is gonna happen somewhere down the line.

3:04:03.220 --> 3:04:04.060
 So.

3:04:04.060 --> 3:04:04.980
 Yeah, the ripple effects of all of that

3:04:04.980 --> 3:04:07.260
 on the unlocking the human potential.

3:04:07.260 --> 3:04:08.100
 It's unbelievable.

3:04:08.100 --> 3:04:12.300
 All those people in Africa are building cool stuff,

3:04:12.300 --> 3:04:13.140
 amazing things.

3:04:13.140 --> 3:04:14.340
 Yes, yes, yes.

3:04:14.340 --> 3:04:15.900
 So some are gonna be built stuff,

3:04:15.900 --> 3:04:17.620
 others are gonna work on the reforms.

3:04:17.620 --> 3:04:19.140
 So we're working on reforms, by the way.

3:04:19.140 --> 3:04:22.940
 I'm the head of the Africa Center for Prosperity

3:04:22.940 --> 3:04:23.940
 of the Atlas Network,

3:04:23.940 --> 3:04:26.060
 the largest organization in the world

3:04:26.060 --> 3:04:27.980
 working on taking down barriers of entry

3:04:27.980 --> 3:04:29.420
 for entrepreneurs around the world

3:04:29.420 --> 3:04:31.020
 in their respective countries.

3:04:31.020 --> 3:04:32.660
 So we're doing great work there.

3:04:32.660 --> 3:04:36.940
 I basically, all the, obviously all the think tanks

3:04:36.940 --> 3:04:41.140
 we have in Africa right now, free market think tanks,

3:04:41.140 --> 3:04:43.860
 and we wanna promote more of them to come up.

3:04:43.860 --> 3:04:46.620
 And these are local solutions by local people

3:04:46.620 --> 3:04:48.780
 for their local problems, always.

3:04:48.780 --> 3:04:50.220
 That's where we draw the line.

3:04:50.220 --> 3:04:55.220
 And so there, so we're working on reforms primarily

3:04:55.580 --> 3:04:57.180
 and making people understand the free markets

3:04:57.180 --> 3:04:58.420
 and the importance of it.

3:05:00.020 --> 3:05:03.180
 But it is piecemeal legislation.

3:05:03.180 --> 3:05:04.700
 It takes time.

3:05:04.700 --> 3:05:05.820
 It is hard.

3:05:05.820 --> 3:05:07.940
 By the time you accomplish something here,

3:05:07.940 --> 3:05:09.620
 more crap has happened over here.

3:05:09.620 --> 3:05:10.900
 More laws have been pounded up

3:05:10.900 --> 3:05:13.460
 because you know how they fix a bad law most of the time.

3:05:13.460 --> 3:05:14.700
 Whether it's in the US or somewhere else.

3:05:14.700 --> 3:05:17.620
 Put other laws to kind of undo the law from before,

3:05:17.620 --> 3:05:18.900
 but it keeps stacking up.

3:05:18.900 --> 3:05:20.340
 And before you know it,

3:05:20.340 --> 3:05:22.500
 where you should have one thing and it's clear,

3:05:22.500 --> 3:05:24.380
 you have a hundred and they go against each other

3:05:24.380 --> 3:05:26.220
 and then it's all, it's worse.

3:05:26.220 --> 3:05:28.940
 So we have piecemeal legislation that's happening.

3:05:28.940 --> 3:05:31.260
 Our teams are doing really amazing, fantastic work,

3:05:31.260 --> 3:05:33.980
 especially the team in Imani in Ghana.

3:05:33.980 --> 3:05:37.100
 We have a group in Burundi, in the Great Lakes.

3:05:37.100 --> 3:05:40.460
 I mean, people are doing amazing work, amazing work,

3:05:40.460 --> 3:05:42.100
 but we need to run faster.

3:05:42.100 --> 3:05:45.260
 So while we keep, we help them running faster,

3:05:45.260 --> 3:05:48.060
 we also have to unlock other things.

3:05:48.060 --> 3:05:49.060
 And right now I'm working

3:05:49.060 --> 3:05:53.020
 on one of my most craziest projects.

3:05:53.020 --> 3:05:57.140
 Something bold, radical, crazy for some people.

3:05:57.140 --> 3:05:58.340
 But I know we're not crazy

3:05:58.340 --> 3:06:00.860
 because before us, Singapore has done it.

3:06:00.860 --> 3:06:03.380
 You know, Hong Kong has done it.

3:06:03.380 --> 3:06:05.940
 Latest, the most recent China with the SSEs,

3:06:05.940 --> 3:06:09.580
 the special economic zones,

3:06:09.580 --> 3:06:12.700
 some of the most radical free market zones in the world,

3:06:12.700 --> 3:06:13.740
 they've done it.

3:06:13.740 --> 3:06:16.380
 And oftentimes within a generation,

3:06:16.380 --> 3:06:19.020
 meaningful change start to happen, right?

3:06:19.020 --> 3:06:23.700
 So here, what I'm working on is this concept of,

3:06:23.700 --> 3:06:27.220
 some call it charter cities, Paul Romer,

3:06:27.220 --> 3:06:32.220
 others call it the free cities.

3:06:32.220 --> 3:06:35.060
 And I like to call it startup cities.

3:06:35.060 --> 3:06:37.420
 What these are is for us to think about,

3:06:37.420 --> 3:06:40.940
 okay, if piecemeal legislation takes forever,

3:06:40.940 --> 3:06:43.820
 while we have this demographic

3:06:43.820 --> 3:06:46.780
 that's growing faster and faster in Africa,

3:06:46.780 --> 3:06:47.980
 there is a discrepancy here

3:06:47.980 --> 3:06:51.020
 between the progress we're making

3:06:51.020 --> 3:06:55.100
 to set the right environment for business to prop up,

3:06:55.100 --> 3:06:58.660
 and how many more people are coming to life,

3:06:58.660 --> 3:07:01.180
 literally every day on the continent.

3:07:01.180 --> 3:07:02.460
 There's a discrepancy here.

3:07:02.460 --> 3:07:05.260
 And so, the ticking bomb is going faster

3:07:05.260 --> 3:07:08.060
 than the progress we can make.

3:07:08.060 --> 3:07:09.420
 This is a problem.

3:07:09.420 --> 3:07:11.140
 So what some of us are working on

3:07:11.140 --> 3:07:12.620
 is this concept of a startup cities

3:07:12.620 --> 3:07:17.220
 and to say, piecemeal legislation takes too long.

3:07:17.220 --> 3:07:18.860
 How about we continue doing that work,

3:07:18.860 --> 3:07:20.740
 which is essential and critical,

3:07:20.740 --> 3:07:23.540
 but at the same time, can we think of zones,

3:07:23.540 --> 3:07:26.660
 and I like to call them also common law zones,

3:07:26.660 --> 3:07:31.660
 where we basically try to have within the country

3:07:31.740 --> 3:07:34.180
 an area where for business,

3:07:34.180 --> 3:07:36.180
 I'm not talking about family law or any of that stuff,

3:07:36.180 --> 3:07:38.220
 no one is touching your culture or anything like that,

3:07:38.220 --> 3:07:40.980
 but we're just saying business wise,

3:07:40.980 --> 3:07:44.100
 an enclave where you have the best practices

3:07:44.100 --> 3:07:46.340
 from around the world, including yours,

3:07:46.340 --> 3:07:50.500
 in terms of what constitute a great business environment

3:07:50.500 --> 3:07:53.780
 and allow people in,

3:07:53.780 --> 3:07:58.780
 like you get in freely or nobody's forcing you to go,

3:07:58.980 --> 3:08:00.740
 nobody's forcing you to whatever.

3:08:00.740 --> 3:08:04.060
 So basically, you're to think about

3:08:04.060 --> 3:08:09.060
 this rather unoccupied plot of land within a country,

3:08:09.220 --> 3:08:12.780
 think Dubai, on 110 acres of land,

3:08:12.780 --> 3:08:16.100
 Dubai is thinking that in their case,

3:08:16.100 --> 3:08:17.980
 they're like, maybe they decided,

3:08:17.980 --> 3:08:20.740
 maybe Sharia law is not the best for business in their case.

3:08:20.740 --> 3:08:22.380
 And they said, they looked around and were like,

3:08:22.380 --> 3:08:24.940
 wow, but common law, especially British common law,

3:08:24.940 --> 3:08:26.700
 seems like a very good one.

3:08:26.700 --> 3:08:29.820
 So at that point, they decided for business only,

3:08:29.820 --> 3:08:31.260
 not family or anything like that,

3:08:31.260 --> 3:08:33.500
 which is gonna stand to Sharia or whatever.

3:08:33.500 --> 3:08:36.460
 And so they said, we are gonna bring in,

3:08:38.500 --> 3:08:40.780
 so they hired retired British common law judges

3:08:40.780 --> 3:08:44.140
 to educate the law and train the people under there.

3:08:44.140 --> 3:08:46.740
 And I'm oversimplifying, but at the end of the day,

3:08:47.820 --> 3:08:49.740
 within a generation,

3:08:49.740 --> 3:08:53.060
 Dubai became one of the top

3:08:53.060 --> 3:08:55.380
 international financial centers of the world.

3:08:55.380 --> 3:08:56.780
 It is what it is today.

3:08:58.900 --> 3:09:00.820
 And in the case of the African nations,

3:09:00.820 --> 3:09:02.620
 that zone can then spread.

3:09:02.620 --> 3:09:06.380
 Yes, it can not only spread, but maybe let's say Senegal,

3:09:06.380 --> 3:09:09.180
 if Senegal was to go for this, here you have this one,

3:09:09.180 --> 3:09:11.100
 and then over there you have another zone.

3:09:11.100 --> 3:09:12.580
 And then what they start to do

3:09:12.580 --> 3:09:14.540
 is they're not all modeled the same way,

3:09:14.540 --> 3:09:15.980
 because maybe this one is saying,

3:09:15.980 --> 3:09:18.180
 hey, we wanna attract more, I don't know,

3:09:18.180 --> 3:09:22.340
 maybe we wanna attract more medical research, right?

3:09:22.340 --> 3:09:23.380
 This one is gonna be saying,

3:09:23.380 --> 3:09:26.100
 maybe we wanna attract more crypto,

3:09:26.100 --> 3:09:27.660
 or maybe it's gonna be more like us,

3:09:27.660 --> 3:09:29.980
 we wanna be more about religious this or whatever.

3:09:29.980 --> 3:09:30.820
 You know what I mean?

3:09:30.820 --> 3:09:32.740
 So we wanted to fit more of this or that.

3:09:32.740 --> 3:09:36.740
 And just kind of give the basics, the grounds,

3:09:36.740 --> 3:09:40.500
 and then watch the magic happen on it, right?

3:09:40.500 --> 3:09:43.500
 And so this is what we're working on.

3:09:43.500 --> 3:09:46.540
 And the hope there, because some people are like,

3:09:46.540 --> 3:09:49.020
 I know some people are like, you guys are crazy,

3:09:49.020 --> 3:09:52.340
 but hey, I'm like, no, it's more or less the story

3:09:52.340 --> 3:09:55.780
 of the Asian tigers.

3:09:55.780 --> 3:09:59.620
 And most recently, most of China's progress,

3:09:59.620 --> 3:10:01.380
 economically speaking, because some people might say,

3:10:01.380 --> 3:10:05.380
 well, you don't want China, we're developing, you see.

3:10:05.380 --> 3:10:10.380
 Even then I say, and it's okay, you can always do better,

3:10:10.660 --> 3:10:14.780
 but we cannot deny what the magic

3:10:14.780 --> 3:10:16.740
 that they have accomplished, what they have accomplished

3:10:16.740 --> 3:10:18.420
 is nothing short of a miracle.

3:10:18.420 --> 3:10:20.660
 800 million people getting out of poverty

3:10:20.660 --> 3:10:21.500
 in such a short amount of time.

3:10:21.500 --> 3:10:22.340
 Yeah, exactly.

3:10:22.340 --> 3:10:25.540
 So it's not, yeah, for the quality of life

3:10:25.540 --> 3:10:27.580
 and the majority of the Chinese population.

3:10:27.580 --> 3:10:28.420
 Yes, yes.

3:10:28.420 --> 3:10:30.180
 Does something like that happen without problems?

3:10:30.180 --> 3:10:31.660
 Of course not.

3:10:31.660 --> 3:10:33.780
 And so the next person to do something

3:10:33.780 --> 3:10:36.020
 just actually gets to learn from lessons,

3:10:36.020 --> 3:10:37.340
 from lessons, that's all.

3:10:37.340 --> 3:10:38.180
 And leapfrog.

3:10:38.180 --> 3:10:40.340
 And leapfrog, and leapfrog, exactly.

3:10:40.340 --> 3:10:41.860
 So for me, this is a promise.

3:10:41.860 --> 3:10:44.180
 And the people are like, oh, but you guys are crazy.

3:10:44.180 --> 3:10:46.100
 But I'm like, just like with everything,

3:10:46.100 --> 3:10:47.380
 do you know how many attempts it took

3:10:47.380 --> 3:10:50.860
 before the first flight, the Wright brothers took off?

3:10:50.860 --> 3:10:52.620
 Do you know how many?

3:10:52.620 --> 3:10:54.220
 And that's important.

3:10:54.220 --> 3:10:56.660
 You try, you crash, you try, you crash,

3:10:56.660 --> 3:10:59.340
 but each time you're going up higher

3:10:59.340 --> 3:11:04.020
 and you want to get up for once, then you stay up longer.

3:11:04.020 --> 3:11:06.660
 And before you know it, you're doing all types of things.

3:11:06.660 --> 3:11:07.580
 So here's the same thing.

3:11:07.580 --> 3:11:14.740
 And I tell people, listen, all I need is one success story.

3:11:14.740 --> 3:11:17.620
 And then the sea change.

3:11:17.620 --> 3:11:19.460
 People don't even wait for us.

3:11:19.460 --> 3:11:20.500
 Everybody.

3:11:20.500 --> 3:11:24.380
 But this is hard because it's the first time.

3:11:24.380 --> 3:11:26.740
 But the good news is there are many groups

3:11:26.740 --> 3:11:28.460
 working on the continent.

3:11:28.460 --> 3:11:31.300
 There are some groups in Zambia.

3:11:31.300 --> 3:11:32.460
 There's a zone there.

3:11:32.460 --> 3:11:35.020
 Folks are doing something like this in Nigeria.

3:11:35.020 --> 3:11:37.820
 We're part of a project there in Nigeria.

3:11:37.820 --> 3:11:39.460
 The one that I'm most excited about,

3:11:39.460 --> 3:11:41.420
 I cannot disclose the name of the country yet.

3:11:41.420 --> 3:11:44.020
 But my god, I'm so excited by it.

3:11:44.020 --> 3:11:46.220
 And I just know, I just know, Lex,

3:11:46.220 --> 3:11:47.780
 it's going to happen in our lifetime.

3:11:47.780 --> 3:11:48.500
 I hope so.

3:11:48.500 --> 3:11:49.980
 It's a really powerful vision.

3:11:49.980 --> 3:11:52.860
 And it's not being dramatic to say

3:11:52.860 --> 3:11:57.300
 that the future of humanity depends on your success,

3:11:57.300 --> 3:11:59.300
 that success in Africa.

3:11:59.300 --> 3:12:02.020
 It's such an important continent.

3:12:02.020 --> 3:12:02.500
 It is.

3:12:02.500 --> 3:12:03.220
 In this century.

3:12:03.220 --> 3:12:05.580
 It's the continent where everything started.

3:12:05.580 --> 3:12:09.500
 And I think it's the continent where that continent has

3:12:09.500 --> 3:12:11.300
 to finally, finally, finally thrive.

3:12:11.300 --> 3:12:16.300
 We cannot, all of us, call ourselves an enlightened

3:12:16.300 --> 3:12:18.420
 society as a whole.

3:12:18.420 --> 3:12:21.020
 When you have such, when you have this,

3:12:21.020 --> 3:12:22.300
 it's a humongous continent.

3:12:22.300 --> 3:12:24.700
 Have you seen the size of it?

3:12:24.700 --> 3:12:25.460
 You know?

3:12:25.460 --> 3:12:26.300
 Yeah.

3:12:26.300 --> 3:12:28.620
 It's hard to fathom, actually.

3:12:28.620 --> 3:12:29.620
 Yeah.

3:12:29.620 --> 3:12:30.460
 Exactly.

3:12:30.460 --> 3:12:33.020
 And it has such ingenious people.

3:12:33.020 --> 3:12:35.700
 Sometimes I look at my people.

3:12:35.700 --> 3:12:41.060
 I have to tell you, I'm so proud of them,

3:12:41.060 --> 3:12:42.740
 and the young people, especially.

3:12:42.740 --> 3:12:44.940
 And you know, you would look at them.

3:12:44.940 --> 3:12:47.100
 And you know, somebody said sometimes one day,

3:12:47.100 --> 3:12:49.580
 and it was so true, they said, you know,

3:12:49.580 --> 3:12:52.260
 we've seen poverty other places.

3:12:52.260 --> 3:12:56.980
 But here, it is just, maybe somebody doesn't have money,

3:12:56.980 --> 3:12:58.660
 but they have dignity.

3:12:58.660 --> 3:13:00.100
 And it's true.

3:13:00.100 --> 3:13:00.740
 Yeah.

3:13:00.740 --> 3:13:02.180
 So everything else we can handle,

3:13:02.180 --> 3:13:03.420
 and we will handle.

3:13:03.420 --> 3:13:05.140
 You have to mark my word for this.

3:13:05.140 --> 3:13:06.660
 This is going to happen.

3:13:06.660 --> 3:13:09.700
 And our youth is amazing.

3:13:09.700 --> 3:13:11.260
 You should see them.

3:13:11.260 --> 3:13:12.620
 So full of creativity.

3:13:12.620 --> 3:13:13.580
 And it doesn't matter.

3:13:13.580 --> 3:13:15.180
 You know, you were telling me, what makes you different?

3:13:15.180 --> 3:13:16.740
 Many things makes us all different.

3:13:16.740 --> 3:13:19.940
 You know, the Rwandans are very different from the West

3:13:19.940 --> 3:13:21.740
 Africans that we are.

3:13:21.740 --> 3:13:24.540
 Rwandans, for example, never dance with their hips.

3:13:24.540 --> 3:13:28.620
 They dance more like, you know, with this part of the body.

3:13:28.620 --> 3:13:30.060
 West Africans hips?

3:13:30.060 --> 3:13:32.260
 Us, it's hips all over the place, all the time.

3:13:32.260 --> 3:13:34.620
 And it's, you know, more jumping, stuff like that.

3:13:34.620 --> 3:13:36.380
 In Rwanda, you feel it's more like, you know,

3:13:36.380 --> 3:13:40.380
 I mean, they remind me more of, you know, the ballet thing.

3:13:40.380 --> 3:13:42.460
 Rwandans have a sense where, you know,

3:13:42.460 --> 3:13:45.260
 they don't eat, you know, so much in public.

3:13:45.260 --> 3:13:46.140
 It's not very well.

3:13:46.140 --> 3:13:47.900
 It's something you do.

3:13:47.900 --> 3:13:50.140
 Us, we are, the West Africans, we like to be loud.

3:13:50.140 --> 3:13:53.660
 We're almost like the Italians of the continent.

3:13:53.660 --> 3:13:56.220
 And then the Rwandans are more like, you know, the Swiss stuff.

3:13:56.220 --> 3:13:58.420
 Actually, the country even looks like Switzerland.

3:13:58.420 --> 3:14:00.780
 I mean, we're so different from one group to another.

3:14:00.780 --> 3:14:02.860
 Then you go to the Congo and you see these guys,

3:14:02.860 --> 3:14:03.700
 they're so crazy.

3:14:03.700 --> 3:14:05.500
 We have a dress, I mean, les sapeurs.

3:14:05.500 --> 3:14:08.460
 So we are a very different bunch.

3:14:08.460 --> 3:14:10.940
 But you know what I love about us,

3:14:10.940 --> 3:14:12.340
 what I love about my people?

3:14:18.660 --> 3:14:21.740
 We are the manifestation of what resiliency means.

3:14:21.740 --> 3:14:26.740
 And so everything we need is there.

3:14:26.740 --> 3:14:29.220
 Everything we need is there.

3:14:29.220 --> 3:14:32.420
 I will say that there's nothing wrong with the seed.

3:14:32.420 --> 3:14:35.940
 Everything that's wrong with us

3:14:35.940 --> 3:14:39.260
 is that pot that we put around us.

3:14:39.260 --> 3:14:43.140
 So we're tired of being bonsai people.

3:14:43.140 --> 3:14:45.780
 We need to be the tallest trees in the forest

3:14:45.780 --> 3:14:47.180
 that we were designed to be.

3:14:47.180 --> 3:14:48.020
 And so...

3:14:48.020 --> 3:14:49.460
 And that can be fixed.

3:14:49.460 --> 3:14:50.260
 And that can be fixed.

3:14:50.260 --> 3:14:51.100
 And that's the beauty of it.

3:14:51.100 --> 3:14:54.740
 And that's why I am so, I'm almost dizzy with,

3:14:54.740 --> 3:14:57.500
 I get dizzy with hope.

3:14:57.500 --> 3:14:59.100
 I know my history.

3:14:59.100 --> 3:15:03.620
 I know my economics, my fellow humans and all of that.

3:15:03.620 --> 3:15:06.340
 And we know that there's an unfailing recipe.

3:15:08.740 --> 3:15:10.020
 And when it comes to that recipe,

3:15:10.020 --> 3:15:11.700
 we have the hardest part of it.

3:15:13.180 --> 3:15:16.300
 The one missing ingredient, which is the free markets.

3:15:18.220 --> 3:15:23.100
 As we go around and talk and people start to understand

3:15:23.100 --> 3:15:25.460
 and each country tries to figure out,

3:15:25.460 --> 3:15:28.140
 okay, where do we go there from here?

3:15:29.660 --> 3:15:34.660
 I know that I will die with my continent

3:15:35.140 --> 3:15:38.860
 having taken the right shift for a turn.

3:15:38.860 --> 3:15:40.180
 I don't have to see where it ends

3:15:40.180 --> 3:15:42.260
 because I cannot in my wildest dream

3:15:42.260 --> 3:15:44.060
 imagine where it's gonna end.

3:15:44.060 --> 3:15:47.620
 But I know it's gonna be, yeah.

3:15:47.620 --> 3:15:52.620
 So my only job is to get this message out

3:15:53.380 --> 3:15:56.340
 and then let my people do with it what they wanna do.

3:15:56.340 --> 3:15:57.180
 That's all.

3:15:57.180 --> 3:15:59.340
 Yeah, the scale of impact is just boundless.

3:15:59.340 --> 3:16:00.180
 It's kind of cool.

3:16:00.180 --> 3:16:02.620
 I mean, sometimes we think about individual problems

3:16:02.620 --> 3:16:03.580
 and how do we solve them?

3:16:03.580 --> 3:16:05.780
 We look up at certain individuals,

3:16:05.780 --> 3:16:08.860
 like the, I don't know, Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.

3:16:08.860 --> 3:16:12.700
 But it's so much more powerful to just,

3:16:12.700 --> 3:16:15.180
 without knowing what they will do,

3:16:15.180 --> 3:16:19.940
 give the freedom to millions,

3:16:19.940 --> 3:16:22.180
 to hundreds of millions of people

3:16:22.180 --> 3:16:23.820
 to do whatever the hell they're gonna do.

3:16:23.820 --> 3:16:25.180
 Can you imagine?

3:16:25.180 --> 3:16:26.500
 Can you just imagine?

3:16:26.500 --> 3:16:27.740
 It's truly, truly exciting.

3:16:27.740 --> 3:16:30.180
 So in that sense, the work you're doing,

3:16:30.180 --> 3:16:33.580
 it's unimaginable the kind of impact it would have.

3:16:33.580 --> 3:16:36.180
 Now, going back to that hard moment,

3:16:36.180 --> 3:16:38.900
 this dark place you went in your mind

3:16:38.900 --> 3:16:41.860
 and your personal life story, you lost your husband.

3:16:41.860 --> 3:16:44.980
 What gave you strength during that time?

3:16:44.980 --> 3:16:49.060
 What were the places you went to your mind

3:16:49.060 --> 3:16:52.780
 in terms of personal struggle,

3:16:52.780 --> 3:16:54.700
 in terms of maybe even depression

3:16:54.700 --> 3:16:57.940
 or these kinds of struggles?

3:16:57.940 --> 3:17:01.260
 I think for me, when my person passed away,

3:17:03.020 --> 3:17:06.220
 I went to,

3:17:08.180 --> 3:17:10.020
 maybe my friends could see what was going on,

3:17:10.020 --> 3:17:11.820
 maybe they couldn't, I don't know.

3:17:11.820 --> 3:17:14.420
 But on the surface, I looked like I was fine.

3:17:14.420 --> 3:17:16.260
 But what happened is the only thing I think

3:17:16.260 --> 3:17:18.620
 that kept me around as I thought about it

3:17:19.900 --> 3:17:24.220
 was the job to be done.

3:17:26.860 --> 3:17:31.260
 These women relied on me and I was no longer free.

3:17:31.260 --> 3:17:32.380
 I did not own myself.

3:17:32.380 --> 3:17:33.420
 And they said it in those words,

3:17:33.420 --> 3:17:34.980
 you don't own yourself anymore.

3:17:36.220 --> 3:17:39.060
 And it was true, but it helped me

3:17:39.060 --> 3:17:43.780
 because I was able to, you know,

3:17:43.780 --> 3:17:45.860
 sometimes whatever it takes to keep you around,

3:17:45.860 --> 3:17:47.100
 whatever it takes.

3:17:47.100 --> 3:17:49.180
 And that's what I would tell people who feel like

3:17:49.180 --> 3:17:51.820
 they can't just push one more push

3:17:51.820 --> 3:17:54.140
 and they think they need to end it.

3:17:54.140 --> 3:17:55.780
 At that point, whatever it takes,

3:17:55.780 --> 3:17:57.980
 just stick around for one more second

3:17:57.980 --> 3:18:00.500
 because the next second, you know.

3:18:00.500 --> 3:18:04.180
 So I stuck around because of duty.

3:18:04.180 --> 3:18:06.300
 I felt a very strong sense of duty.

3:18:06.300 --> 3:18:08.300
 My duty was in this case, I think,

3:18:08.300 --> 3:18:10.420
 stronger than my pain.

3:18:10.420 --> 3:18:13.660
 I don't know how that was possible, but it was.

3:18:17.260 --> 3:18:20.940
 And I just pushed my grief under the rug for years.

3:18:20.940 --> 3:18:22.740
 For years, I worked like a mad lady.

3:18:23.940 --> 3:18:28.020
 I would travel, I would do three states in three days,

3:18:28.020 --> 3:18:29.780
 landing at two in the morning,

3:18:29.780 --> 3:18:33.020
 around five or six going right along with our distributors

3:18:33.020 --> 3:18:35.460
 because it was beverage and just keep going

3:18:35.460 --> 3:18:38.380
 and have all of this energy and look like everything is fine.

3:18:38.380 --> 3:18:39.700
 But what happened was just like,

3:18:39.700 --> 3:18:41.380
 I was focused on the job to be done.

3:18:41.380 --> 3:18:43.700
 And sometimes it is okay to do that.

3:18:43.700 --> 3:18:46.780
 At least for me, it was my safety.

3:18:46.780 --> 3:18:47.860
 You know, like when you're in the water

3:18:47.860 --> 3:18:50.580
 and you're about to sink and they throw you that,

3:18:50.580 --> 3:18:53.420
 that round thing, I don't know how you call it.

3:18:53.420 --> 3:18:55.140
 You know, that, you know.

3:18:55.140 --> 3:18:56.140
 I think that keeps you afloat, you mean?

3:18:56.140 --> 3:18:57.220
 Yes, yes, the floater.

3:18:57.220 --> 3:18:58.460
 It's the floater. Yeah, whatever.

3:18:58.460 --> 3:19:01.980
 Listen, between the two of us, we're still terrible.

3:19:01.980 --> 3:19:02.820
 We're bad.

3:19:02.820 --> 3:19:04.940
 So I said, you, you, you.

3:19:04.940 --> 3:19:06.260
 I know exactly what you mean.

3:19:06.260 --> 3:19:07.100
 Exactly, right?

3:19:07.100 --> 3:19:08.140
 So you understand me.

3:19:08.140 --> 3:19:10.540
 So they send you that thing and you just,

3:19:10.540 --> 3:19:12.540
 I was just hanging onto it.

3:19:12.540 --> 3:19:14.380
 My life depended on this thing.

3:19:14.380 --> 3:19:17.460
 So these women, they carried me.

3:19:17.460 --> 3:19:19.220
 They carried me.

3:19:19.220 --> 3:19:23.500
 And with time, things are moving forward.

3:19:23.500 --> 3:19:26.820
 And at some point I went into really, really deep depression

3:19:26.820 --> 3:19:29.580
 and I went into a very dark place,

3:19:29.580 --> 3:19:31.780
 even darker than the one I think I came from.

3:19:31.780 --> 3:19:35.100
 Because by that time I had worked for years

3:19:35.100 --> 3:19:37.860
 on this company and now some other things was happening.

3:19:37.860 --> 3:19:42.060
 And around that time, it's also when I was discovering

3:19:42.060 --> 3:19:45.060
 a lot of what we talked about today,

3:19:45.060 --> 3:19:47.900
 about what makes a country rich.

3:19:47.900 --> 3:19:52.740
 And for me to understand that my network,

3:19:52.740 --> 3:19:56.180
 I was very much into left oriented network.

3:19:56.180 --> 3:20:01.180
 And to just start to see all of this,

3:20:02.580 --> 3:20:05.660
 I tried to address it to realize that many of these people

3:20:05.660 --> 3:20:08.060
 would prefer go running for the hills

3:20:08.060 --> 3:20:11.860
 than accept for a moment that maybe capitalism

3:20:11.860 --> 3:20:13.660
 might be part of a solution,

3:20:13.660 --> 3:20:16.300
 when many of them were involved in capitalism.

3:20:17.300 --> 3:20:20.300
 So that was a hard time.

3:20:21.500 --> 3:20:23.940
 At some point I was, yeah,

3:20:23.940 --> 3:20:27.260
 so many things were happening around that time

3:20:27.260 --> 3:20:32.260
 that basically shook up everything for me.

3:20:32.980 --> 3:20:34.980
 One, it's hard to talk about because it's very personal

3:20:34.980 --> 3:20:38.860
 and the person that I was having a problem with

3:20:38.860 --> 3:20:41.060
 passed away last year.

3:20:41.060 --> 3:20:45.220
 And I'm one to always say, leave the dead alone.

3:20:45.220 --> 3:20:48.060
 So because of that, I won't speak about it,

3:20:48.060 --> 3:20:50.460
 but there to having a major fallout

3:20:50.460 --> 3:20:52.900
 with somebody who was like a father figure for me,

3:20:52.900 --> 3:20:55.180
 somebody that I completely trusted.

3:20:55.180 --> 3:20:58.660
 And so at some point you just tell, ask yourself,

3:20:58.660 --> 3:21:03.660
 was my whole life built on a lie, right?

3:21:04.340 --> 3:21:09.100
 And then you're confused and then you become confused.

3:21:09.100 --> 3:21:12.580
 And then at some point you lose 90% of your friends

3:21:12.580 --> 3:21:15.580
 because of, ideologically speaking, it doesn't work anymore.

3:21:18.580 --> 3:21:22.100
 Then you just wonder, have I,

3:21:22.100 --> 3:21:25.340
 have I been asleep this whole time?

3:21:25.340 --> 3:21:26.260
 And then you start to wonder,

3:21:26.260 --> 3:21:28.020
 remember when you asked me, who am I?

3:21:28.020 --> 3:21:31.300
 At some point, Lex, I literally was like a candle

3:21:31.300 --> 3:21:32.140
 in the wind.

3:21:33.620 --> 3:21:35.620
 I felt like I was a candle in the wind.

3:21:36.660 --> 3:21:38.860
 And it was very hard to come back from that.

3:21:38.860 --> 3:21:41.980
 And people have a hard,

3:21:41.980 --> 3:21:43.820
 the few people I talk to about this,

3:21:43.820 --> 3:21:45.460
 they have a hardest time understanding

3:21:45.460 --> 3:21:48.100
 or even believing it because they're like, you?

3:21:48.100 --> 3:21:49.940
 I'm like, yes, me.

3:21:49.940 --> 3:21:52.260
 I used to be a candle in the wind.

3:21:52.260 --> 3:21:53.620
 What got you out?

3:21:53.620 --> 3:21:55.420
 What made you overcome that?

3:21:55.420 --> 3:21:57.420
 My current husband.

3:21:57.420 --> 3:21:58.380
 My current husband.

3:21:58.380 --> 3:21:59.220
 Love?

3:21:59.220 --> 3:22:00.060
 Love.

3:22:00.060 --> 3:22:01.940
 See, when I tell you love is the answer.

3:22:01.940 --> 3:22:04.300
 But him, he came with love,

3:22:04.300 --> 3:22:08.780
 but he also came with really helping me

3:22:08.780 --> 3:22:10.180
 figure out the world.

3:22:10.180 --> 3:22:11.860
 So what Michael, because that's him,

3:22:11.860 --> 3:22:13.820
 who we're talking about, Michael Strong.

3:22:15.140 --> 3:22:16.420
 That must be special.

3:22:16.420 --> 3:22:17.660
 He's so special.

3:22:17.660 --> 3:22:18.900
 He's so special.

3:22:18.900 --> 3:22:21.420
 So you have no idea how special he is.

3:22:21.420 --> 3:22:24.940
 But you know, Michael, the reason why I have such love,

3:22:24.940 --> 3:22:26.860
 respect and admiration for my husband,

3:22:26.860 --> 3:22:28.540
 I'll never say it enough,

3:22:28.540 --> 3:22:32.340
 is because actually it's one of those relationships

3:22:32.340 --> 3:22:37.340
 that got built based on intellect first.

3:22:37.420 --> 3:22:41.300
 You see, at some point I was in the position

3:22:41.300 --> 3:22:43.540
 where I could start a foundation

3:22:44.500 --> 3:22:46.860
 after having built my first business.

3:22:46.860 --> 3:22:51.860
 And all I wanted was an ability to power

3:22:54.300 --> 3:22:56.980
 as many, especially women,

3:22:56.980 --> 3:23:00.620
 African women entrepreneurs like me a few years ago,

3:23:00.620 --> 3:23:04.540
 before then, to do something like I was able to do.

3:23:04.540 --> 3:23:06.020
 Bring back to the world

3:23:06.020 --> 3:23:08.260
 some really cool aspects of our culture

3:23:08.260 --> 3:23:11.740
 built into a really cool brand, 21st century type.

3:23:11.740 --> 3:23:12.820
 That's what I wanted to do.

3:23:12.820 --> 3:23:15.620
 Because the more I could promote women like that

3:23:15.620 --> 3:23:17.460
 and put steam behind them,

3:23:17.460 --> 3:23:19.700
 and the more my dream envisioned

3:23:19.700 --> 3:23:22.540
 for a respected Africa, prosperous Africa would happen,

3:23:22.540 --> 3:23:24.660
 back then that's what I wanted.

3:23:24.660 --> 3:23:26.220
 And around me,

3:23:26.220 --> 3:23:28.980
 this was also part of a whole crisis

3:23:28.980 --> 3:23:32.020
 of ideologies I had back then.

3:23:32.020 --> 3:23:36.380
 Everybody was like, well, we should be just doing grants.

3:23:37.580 --> 3:23:40.660
 And I knew that my people didn't need grants.

3:23:40.660 --> 3:23:42.260
 They didn't need like a handout.

3:23:42.260 --> 3:23:45.260
 They don't want your charity.

3:23:45.260 --> 3:23:46.900
 I didn't want charity.

3:23:46.900 --> 3:23:50.260
 I wanted someone who could work with me on my accounting.

3:23:50.260 --> 3:23:53.780
 I wanted somebody who could help me brainstorm

3:23:53.780 --> 3:23:55.060
 marketing wise.

3:23:55.060 --> 3:23:58.620
 I wanted somebody, or I needed to raise money

3:23:58.620 --> 3:24:02.580
 to pay my research and development guy

3:24:02.580 --> 3:24:07.100
 to help me take the juices from my grandma's recipe

3:24:07.100 --> 3:24:10.420
 to something that can be shelf stable.

3:24:10.420 --> 3:24:14.460
 I needed coaching.

3:24:14.460 --> 3:24:16.740
 These are all the things that I needed

3:24:16.740 --> 3:24:18.100
 to make my dream happen.

3:24:18.100 --> 3:24:20.220
 I didn't want you to give me some crap for free.

3:24:20.220 --> 3:24:21.180
 That's not what I want.

3:24:21.180 --> 3:24:24.060
 I just want to be able to build my business

3:24:24.060 --> 3:24:26.540
 with all the things that business building needs.

3:24:26.540 --> 3:24:29.740
 And so that's what I wanted to do

3:24:29.740 --> 3:24:31.340
 and it's what it was needed.

3:24:31.340 --> 3:24:35.700
 And so Michael, somebody found out about what I was doing

3:24:35.700 --> 3:24:37.100
 because back in the days of San Francisco,

3:24:37.100 --> 3:24:38.740
 they would write a lot about me and everything.

3:24:38.740 --> 3:24:43.100
 And so Michael, along with John Mackey,

3:24:43.100 --> 3:24:44.380
 the founder of Whole Foods Market,

3:24:44.380 --> 3:24:47.500
 they had a nonprofit called Flow.

3:24:47.500 --> 3:24:49.380
 And it's all about human flourishing.

3:24:49.380 --> 3:24:52.140
 They want for people, everybody to get this choice,

3:24:52.140 --> 3:24:54.580
 this ability to be able to get to a point in their life

3:24:54.580 --> 3:24:56.340
 where they're in complete flow.

3:24:56.340 --> 3:24:58.540
 It's, Michael, just make high.

3:24:58.540 --> 3:25:00.340
 Michael is the only one who could say that last name.

3:25:00.340 --> 3:25:01.860
 But you know, the whole concept of flow,

3:25:01.860 --> 3:25:02.980
 when you're in a state of flow,

3:25:02.980 --> 3:25:05.900
 you're basically doing what you're supposed to do,

3:25:05.900 --> 3:25:06.900
 the way you're supposed to do it

3:25:06.900 --> 3:25:09.820
 with the people you're supposed to, this whole concept of flow.

3:25:09.820 --> 3:25:12.340
 It's human flourishing at its highest.

3:25:12.340 --> 3:25:15.380
 So, you know, so I meet with this man.

3:25:15.380 --> 3:25:20.380
 Max, you're so, okay, so we, he finds me, his people find me.

3:25:21.060 --> 3:25:22.700
 And then there was a program

3:25:22.700 --> 3:25:25.860
 where it was all about accelerating women entrepreneurs.

3:25:25.860 --> 3:25:27.620
 So it's during this times

3:25:27.620 --> 3:25:29.940
 that I'm starting now to see things.

3:25:29.940 --> 3:25:33.020
 That's when actually all of this stuff that I noticed,

3:25:33.020 --> 3:25:35.300
 how come here it takes me all of this time

3:25:35.300 --> 3:25:37.020
 to start my business, over there it's 20 minutes,

3:25:37.020 --> 3:25:39.020
 here it's free, over there it's thousands of dollars,

3:25:39.020 --> 3:25:40.580
 all of this nonsense that I just took,

3:25:40.580 --> 3:25:41.900
 oh, maybe it's just because we're messed up,

3:25:41.900 --> 3:25:44.860
 we're poor, that's why everything is so messed up.

3:25:44.860 --> 3:25:47.460
 Whoa, these people are introducing me to concepts.

3:25:47.460 --> 3:25:50.860
 I'm like, first of all, I'm like, oh, really?

3:25:50.860 --> 3:25:55.860
 What did you call the doing business in the, what is that?

3:25:56.380 --> 3:25:58.340
 You know, all of this stuff.

3:25:58.340 --> 3:26:02.500
 And I'm starting to discover this whole other body of work.

3:26:02.500 --> 3:26:06.900
 That the free markets, like this thing that I was sensing,

3:26:06.900 --> 3:26:08.260
 this environment that I was sensing

3:26:08.260 --> 3:26:10.980
 that it was different around me.

3:26:10.980 --> 3:26:13.860
 And that they called it the free markets over here.

3:26:13.860 --> 3:26:15.660
 And over there, that.

3:26:15.660 --> 3:26:18.460
 And then I started to butt head those ideas

3:26:18.460 --> 3:26:21.740
 with the ideas that I was fed with before that.

3:26:21.740 --> 3:26:23.820
 And the evidence won.

3:26:23.820 --> 3:26:25.660
 And further more than the evidence,

3:26:25.660 --> 3:26:29.300
 the evidence combined with my lived experience,

3:26:29.300 --> 3:26:30.700
 it was so powerful.

3:26:30.700 --> 3:26:34.060
 So I basically started understanding these ideas

3:26:34.060 --> 3:26:36.460
 from the most visceral part of my body,

3:26:36.460 --> 3:26:37.860
 you know, of my being.

3:26:38.860 --> 3:26:41.060
 And it makes sense.

3:26:41.060 --> 3:26:45.420
 So Michael, Michael helped me find the solution,

3:26:45.420 --> 3:26:49.900
 the answer to my lifelong little girl's question

3:26:49.900 --> 3:26:52.260
 of why do they have this and we don't?

3:26:52.260 --> 3:26:55.540
 And how do some countries like mine be poor

3:26:55.540 --> 3:26:57.540
 while others are rich?

3:26:57.540 --> 3:27:01.580
 And with understanding all of that,

3:27:02.460 --> 3:27:07.460
 the greatest, biggest sense of liberation came upon me.

3:27:09.220 --> 3:27:12.380
 Like, I have no other word to describe that.

3:27:13.780 --> 3:27:16.820
 True liberation, the liberation that comes from a peer

3:27:16.820 --> 3:27:21.820
 to finally understand and be vindicated

3:27:21.900 --> 3:27:25.260
 in your own, you know,

3:27:25.260 --> 3:27:29.100
 understand in your own deep knowing

3:27:29.100 --> 3:27:32.460
 or feeling that they're not,

3:27:32.460 --> 3:27:33.660
 what they're saying is not true.

3:27:33.660 --> 3:27:35.100
 You're not the problem.

3:27:35.100 --> 3:27:36.620
 It's not you.

3:27:36.620 --> 3:27:38.620
 There's something else.

3:27:38.620 --> 3:27:41.260
 And when I discovered that, my whole life changed.

3:27:41.260 --> 3:27:44.740
 So, and since then I have been very serious

3:27:44.740 --> 3:27:46.620
 about going deeper and deeper and deeper

3:27:46.620 --> 3:27:49.780
 into my understanding of all of this,

3:27:49.780 --> 3:27:52.020
 understanding the subtlety.

3:27:52.020 --> 3:27:53.860
 At some point I was very angry

3:27:53.860 --> 3:27:55.700
 about the liberators of Africa,

3:27:55.700 --> 3:27:58.380
 because I was like, yes, you helped liberate us,

3:27:58.380 --> 3:28:00.260
 but just to keep us in this mirrorism,

3:28:01.180 --> 3:28:03.300
 I was angry for longest time.

3:28:03.300 --> 3:28:07.780
 And then eventually you have to engage empathy and love

3:28:08.660 --> 3:28:10.140
 to put yourself in their shoes

3:28:10.140 --> 3:28:13.260
 and try to understand the time at which they were living.

3:28:13.260 --> 3:28:14.500
 And that got me onto a journey

3:28:14.500 --> 3:28:17.100
 of trying to understand history more.

3:28:17.100 --> 3:28:19.340
 That's how I understood I was able to go beyond

3:28:19.340 --> 3:28:21.980
 just these liberators and try to understand

3:28:21.980 --> 3:28:23.580
 and rebuild the world around them

3:28:23.580 --> 3:28:28.580
 at the macro and also at the macro level.

3:28:29.140 --> 3:28:31.740
 Just really, you have to try to walk in their shoes.

3:28:33.060 --> 3:28:36.780
 And from there, finally separate the baby with the bathwater

3:28:36.780 --> 3:28:38.660
 that they were not able to do back then.

3:28:38.660 --> 3:28:40.660
 That's why today, I'm sorry,

3:28:40.660 --> 3:28:44.740
 but I have no patience for the BLM organizers, founders,

3:28:44.740 --> 3:28:45.580
 especially the founders.

3:28:45.580 --> 3:28:46.420
 I don't know what the organizers think,

3:28:46.420 --> 3:28:48.780
 but the founders told us what they stand for.

3:28:48.780 --> 3:28:51.820
 And I say, guys, don't make that same mistake again.

3:28:51.820 --> 3:28:53.060
 If you're serious about this,

3:28:53.060 --> 3:28:54.700
 you cannot make the same mistake.

3:28:56.300 --> 3:29:00.260
 The liberals of Africa, they have an excuse.

3:29:00.260 --> 3:29:01.100
 We didn't know better.

3:29:01.100 --> 3:29:04.940
 It was so easy back then to conflate everything.

3:29:04.940 --> 3:29:08.340
 But today, you, me, anybody alive

3:29:08.340 --> 3:29:10.500
 cannot with a straight face

3:29:10.500 --> 3:29:12.460
 embrace Marxist socialist ideas,

3:29:12.460 --> 3:29:16.420
 especially, especially when they're claiming

3:29:16.420 --> 3:29:20.340
 that they wanted people to thrive.

3:29:20.340 --> 3:29:22.460
 No, you can't, I'm sorry.

3:29:22.460 --> 3:29:26.060
 And I will hold your feet up to the fire on that one.

3:29:26.060 --> 3:29:27.020
 I will, I will.

3:29:27.020 --> 3:29:28.060
 And that's what I'm doing.

3:29:28.060 --> 3:29:29.180
 They will give me a lot of grief for this,

3:29:29.180 --> 3:29:30.020
 but guess what?

3:29:30.020 --> 3:29:30.860
 I could care less.

3:29:30.860 --> 3:29:32.460
 Do you know why I could care less?

3:29:32.460 --> 3:29:34.500
 Because we have an entire population

3:29:35.620 --> 3:29:40.380
 to help rise out of poverty into prosperity,

3:29:40.380 --> 3:29:44.500
 where they become co creators,

3:29:44.500 --> 3:29:47.300
 global co creators of innovation.

3:29:47.300 --> 3:29:52.300
 And those ideas give you hope for the place you love,

3:29:52.380 --> 3:29:54.260
 for Senegal, for Africa.

3:29:54.260 --> 3:29:55.260
 They do.

3:29:55.260 --> 3:29:56.100
 They do.

3:29:56.100 --> 3:29:57.180
 The world I live in,

3:29:59.140 --> 3:30:03.020
 the new centers of culture and fashion are in Dakar.

3:30:03.020 --> 3:30:08.020
 The new centers of tech and, you know,

3:30:10.060 --> 3:30:13.540
 crypto even is somewhere, maybe Nigeria.

3:30:13.540 --> 3:30:16.380
 So you see that future, you see that future clearly.

3:30:16.380 --> 3:30:18.900
 I do, I do, I do.

3:30:18.900 --> 3:30:20.060
 It's a beautiful thing.

3:30:20.060 --> 3:30:22.500
 And it's also beautiful to see that the space

3:30:22.500 --> 3:30:24.900
 of these really powerful ideas

3:30:24.900 --> 3:30:26.700
 is where you also found love.

3:30:26.700 --> 3:30:27.540
 Right?

3:30:27.540 --> 3:30:28.780
 So at the intersection.

3:30:28.780 --> 3:30:31.820
 At the intersection, Michael and I would spend hours

3:30:31.820 --> 3:30:33.100
 talking about all of these ideas.

3:30:33.100 --> 3:30:34.660
 And I would be like, but what about this?

3:30:34.660 --> 3:30:35.980
 No, it doesn't make any sense.

3:30:35.980 --> 3:30:37.180
 No, no, no, oh no.

3:30:37.180 --> 3:30:41.500
 And then hours, every single day for months, Lex.

3:30:41.500 --> 3:30:42.420
 Yeah.

3:30:42.420 --> 3:30:44.980
 And then from there, our love was born.

3:30:44.980 --> 3:30:47.260
 Cause I tell people for us,

3:30:47.260 --> 3:30:49.060
 love is not about looking at each other in the eyes,

3:30:49.060 --> 3:30:50.460
 like, you know, they all think,

3:30:50.460 --> 3:30:52.460
 but it's about, we look in one direction.

3:30:52.460 --> 3:30:53.900
 And in this case, it's this vision,

3:30:53.900 --> 3:30:55.860
 what we know to be possible and true.

3:30:55.860 --> 3:30:58.420
 If only you liberate people.

3:30:59.580 --> 3:31:01.860
 What we know to be true and possible.

3:31:01.860 --> 3:31:04.820
 We, all of us are miracles walking around.

3:31:04.820 --> 3:31:06.180
 Every time I get on a plane,

3:31:06.180 --> 3:31:08.620
 it's a miracle of engineering.

3:31:09.620 --> 3:31:11.100
 All the things we're able to do, you know,

3:31:11.100 --> 3:31:13.340
 now when they do operation on your teeth,

3:31:13.340 --> 3:31:16.660
 how they're able to put the pain down away.

3:31:16.660 --> 3:31:17.980
 All of this is us.

3:31:17.980 --> 3:31:20.380
 You're working on these robots.

3:31:20.380 --> 3:31:22.860
 This, this, this inside here.

3:31:22.860 --> 3:31:23.860
 Humans are amazing.

3:31:23.860 --> 3:31:24.780
 I know.

3:31:24.780 --> 3:31:27.220
 So that's why, and when it works in great tandem

3:31:27.220 --> 3:31:30.380
 with this guy, these two working together.

3:31:30.380 --> 3:31:31.220
 Yeah.

3:31:31.220 --> 3:31:32.060
 Ooh.

3:31:32.060 --> 3:31:32.900
 Watch out.

3:31:32.900 --> 3:31:33.740
 There's nothing we can't accomplish.

3:31:33.740 --> 3:31:35.180
 Nothing, nothing.

3:31:35.180 --> 3:31:37.740
 Well, God, you're one of the most incredible people

3:31:37.740 --> 3:31:38.580
 I've ever talked to.

3:31:38.580 --> 3:31:39.740
 Oh, you say that.

3:31:39.740 --> 3:31:40.580
 You're amazing.

3:31:40.580 --> 3:31:41.420
 You've met everybody.

3:31:41.420 --> 3:31:42.240
 Thank you so much.

3:31:42.240 --> 3:31:43.500
 This is truly an honor.

3:31:43.500 --> 3:31:44.580
 Thank you for everything you're doing.

3:31:44.580 --> 3:31:46.820
 Thank you for the fire that burns within you.

3:31:46.820 --> 3:31:48.500
 And there's just the passion you have

3:31:48.500 --> 3:31:50.580
 for a place that's going to, I think,

3:31:50.580 --> 3:31:52.020
 define the future of humanity.

3:31:52.020 --> 3:31:53.300
 So thank you for everything you're doing.

3:31:53.300 --> 3:31:54.140
 Thank you for talking to me.

3:31:54.140 --> 3:31:54.980
 Thank you.

3:31:54.980 --> 3:31:55.800
 Thank you to you.

3:31:55.800 --> 3:31:57.740
 And sometimes I hope this fire doesn't consume me.

3:31:57.740 --> 3:31:59.260
 That's how much it is.

3:31:59.260 --> 3:32:02.340
 But I am grateful to you for this.

3:32:02.340 --> 3:32:04.640
 And yeah, thank you for,

3:32:04.640 --> 3:32:06.620
 I know you don't do a lot of these, you know,

3:32:06.620 --> 3:32:09.060
 I am, it's this type of interviews.

3:32:09.060 --> 3:32:11.660
 Maybe I don't know, but I'm so, so happy.

3:32:11.660 --> 3:32:14.980
 You mean fun, inspiring, powerful interviews.

3:32:14.980 --> 3:32:16.420
 Yes, I need to do more of that.

3:32:16.420 --> 3:32:17.260
 You're amazing.

3:32:17.260 --> 3:32:18.620
 I don't know, because at first I was like,

3:32:18.620 --> 3:32:20.100
 Lex Friedman, really?

3:32:20.100 --> 3:32:20.940
 Yeah, really?

3:32:20.940 --> 3:32:21.780
 How's this going to go?

3:32:21.780 --> 3:32:23.700
 I'm like, yeah, I'm going to talk to Lex

3:32:23.700 --> 3:32:24.540
 and go all crazy.

3:32:24.540 --> 3:32:27.700
 I think you need to work on your unconscious bias.

3:32:27.700 --> 3:32:28.520
 Right.

3:32:29.920 --> 3:32:30.760
 All right, thank you, Magat.

3:32:30.760 --> 3:32:31.580
 You're the best.

3:32:31.580 --> 3:32:32.420
 Thank you.

3:32:32.420 --> 3:32:33.260
 Thank you.

3:32:33.260 --> 3:32:34.560
 Thank you so much.

3:32:34.560 --> 3:32:37.540
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Magat Wade.

 And now, let me leave you with some words

3:32:43.580 --> 3:32:44.900
 from Nelson Mandela.

3:32:46.000 --> 3:32:48.460
 Money won't create success.

3:32:48.460 --> 3:32:51.060
 The freedom to make it will.

3:32:51.060 --> 3:33:11.060
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
