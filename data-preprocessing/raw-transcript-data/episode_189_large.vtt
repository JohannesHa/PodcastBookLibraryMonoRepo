00:00.000 --> 00:02.760
 The following is a conversation with David Sinclair.

00:02.760 --> 00:06.200
 He's a professor in the Department of Genetics at Harvard

00:06.200 --> 00:08.920
 and co director of the Paul F. Glenn Center

00:08.920 --> 00:12.280
 for the Biology of Aging at Harvard Medical School.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.280
 He's the author of the book,

00:13.280 --> 00:16.840
 Lifespan and co founder of several biotech companies.

00:16.840 --> 00:20.800
 He works on turning age into an engineering problem

00:20.800 --> 00:22.160
 and solving it.

00:22.160 --> 00:23.960
 Driven by a vision of a world

00:23.960 --> 00:25.960
 where billions of people can live much longer

00:25.960 --> 00:28.160
 and much healthier lives.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.360
 Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:30.360 --> 00:33.400
 Onnit, Clear, National Instruments,

00:33.400 --> 00:36.840
 and I, SimpliSafe and Linode.

00:36.840 --> 00:40.040
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.780
 As a side note, let me say that longevity research

00:42.780 --> 00:45.880
 challenges us to think how science and engineering

00:45.880 --> 00:47.640
 will change society.

00:47.640 --> 00:50.400
 Imagine if we can live 100,000 years,

00:50.400 --> 00:51.920
 even under controlled conditions,

00:51.920 --> 00:53.720
 like in a spaceship say,

00:53.720 --> 00:55.960
 then suddenly a trip to Alpha Centauri

00:55.960 --> 00:58.840
 that is a 4.37 light years away

00:58.840 --> 01:01.280
 takes a single human lifespan.

01:01.280 --> 01:05.160
 And on the psychological, maybe even philosophical level,

01:05.160 --> 01:08.720
 as the horizons of death drifts farther into the distance,

01:08.720 --> 01:11.120
 how will our search for meaning change?

01:11.120 --> 01:13.080
 Does meaning require death

01:13.080 --> 01:15.720
 or does it merely require struggle?

01:15.720 --> 01:19.440
 Reprogramming our biology will require us to delve deeper

01:19.440 --> 01:23.680
 into understanding the human mind and the robot mind.

01:23.680 --> 01:26.600
 Both of these efforts are as exciting of a journey

01:26.600 --> 01:28.160
 as I can imagine.

01:28.160 --> 01:30.320
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast

01:30.320 --> 01:33.400
 and here is my conversation with David Sinclair.

01:34.360 --> 01:38.320
 I usually feel like the same person when I was 12.

01:38.320 --> 01:42.460
 Like when I, right now, as I think about myself,

01:42.460 --> 01:45.040
 I feel like exactly the same person

01:45.040 --> 01:46.400
 that I was when I was 12.

01:46.400 --> 01:51.400
 And yet, I am getting older, both body and mind,

01:51.400 --> 01:54.240
 and still feel like time hasn't passed at all.

01:54.240 --> 01:56.880
 Do you feel this tension in yourself

01:56.880 --> 02:01.000
 that you're the same person and yet you're aging?

02:01.000 --> 02:04.640
 Yeah, I have this tension that I'm still a kid,

02:04.640 --> 02:05.880
 but that helps in my career.

02:05.880 --> 02:07.920
 Scientists need to have a wonder about the world

02:07.920 --> 02:10.520
 and you don't wanna grow up at 12 year olds

02:10.520 --> 02:13.380
 and even younger, I would say six, seven year olds.

02:13.380 --> 02:16.560
 I've still got that boy in me and I can look at things.

02:16.560 --> 02:18.240
 It's a gift, I think, that I can see things

02:18.240 --> 02:19.960
 for the first time if I choose to,

02:19.960 --> 02:23.160
 and then explain them as I would to a six year old

02:23.160 --> 02:24.960
 because I am that mentally.

02:24.960 --> 02:26.720
 But on the other hand, I'm getting older, right?

02:26.720 --> 02:29.240
 I run a lab of 20 people at Harvard.

02:29.240 --> 02:33.520
 I've got a book, I've got science to do, companies to run,

02:33.520 --> 02:35.680
 and so I have to, on most days,

02:35.680 --> 02:38.160
 just pretend to be a grownup and be mature,

02:38.160 --> 02:40.640
 but I definitely don't feel that way.

02:40.640 --> 02:43.400
 There's something I really appreciated

02:43.400 --> 02:44.920
 in opening your book.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.920
 You talked about your grandmother.

02:46.920 --> 02:50.380
 And on this kind of theme, on this kind of topic,

02:51.240 --> 02:53.720
 she, first of all, had a big influence on you.

02:53.720 --> 02:56.540
 My grandmother had a big influence on me.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.080
 And you also mentioned this poem

02:59.080 --> 03:03.760
 by the author of Winnie the Pooh, Alan Alexander Milne.

03:04.720 --> 03:06.120
 Maybe I can read it real quick

03:06.120 --> 03:10.280
 because I love, on the topic of being children,

03:10.280 --> 03:12.560
 when I was one, I had just begun.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.800
 When I was two, I was nearly new.

03:14.800 --> 03:17.240
 When I was three, I was hardly me.

03:17.240 --> 03:19.840
 When I was four, I was not much more.

03:19.840 --> 03:24.320
 When I was five, I was just alive, but now I am six.

03:24.320 --> 03:27.480
 I am as clever, as clever, so I think I'll be six,

03:27.480 --> 03:29.600
 now, forever and ever.

03:31.440 --> 03:36.440
 So this idea of being six and staying six forever,

03:37.720 --> 03:39.320
 being youthful, being curious,

03:39.320 --> 03:43.360
 being childlike, this and other things,

03:43.360 --> 03:46.760
 what influence has your grandmother had

03:46.760 --> 03:51.540
 in your thinking about life, about death, about love?

03:53.200 --> 03:54.920
 Yeah, I was getting misty eyed as you read that

03:54.920 --> 03:58.040
 because that poem was read to me very often,

03:58.040 --> 03:59.520
 if not every day, by my grandmother,

03:59.520 --> 04:01.400
 who partially raised me.

04:02.300 --> 04:06.420
 And she was as much a bohemian as an artist, philosopher.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.120
 And she's one of those people

04:08.120 --> 04:09.760
 that wouldn't talk about the little things.

04:09.760 --> 04:11.560
 She said, I hate small talk.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.960
 Don't talk to me about politics or the weather.

04:13.960 --> 04:16.920
 Yeah, talk to me about human beings and culture.

04:16.920 --> 04:18.040
 So I was raised on that,

04:18.040 --> 04:20.600
 and this poem was one that she read to me often

04:20.600 --> 04:25.600
 because she knew that the mind of a child is precious,

04:26.040 --> 04:28.520
 it's honest, it's pure.

04:28.520 --> 04:31.480
 And she grew up during the Second World War

04:31.480 --> 04:35.680
 and in Hungary and Budapest witnessed the worst of humanity.

04:35.680 --> 04:40.060
 She was trying to save a whole group of Jewish friends

04:40.060 --> 04:43.180
 in her apartment, saw what happened after the World War,

04:43.180 --> 04:47.760
 which was there was, the Russians were in control

04:47.760 --> 04:50.320
 and locals weren't necessarily treated well

04:50.320 --> 04:52.520
 if they were rebellious, which she was.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.440
 And then there was the revolution in 56,

04:54.440 --> 04:57.240
 which she was part of and had to escape the country.

04:57.240 --> 05:01.260
 So she saw what can happen when humans do their worst.

05:01.260 --> 05:05.240
 And her words to me, expressed in part through that poem

05:05.240 --> 05:09.560
 was, David, always stay young and innocent

05:09.560 --> 05:11.600
 and have wonder about the world,

05:11.600 --> 05:15.440
 and then do your best to make humanity the best it can be.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.340
 And that's who I am, that's what I live for,

05:18.340 --> 05:19.800
 that's what I get up in the morning to do

05:19.800 --> 05:21.640
 is to leave the world a better place

05:21.640 --> 05:23.180
 and show to whoever's watching us,

05:23.180 --> 05:26.760
 whether it's aliens or some future human historian,

05:26.760 --> 05:29.520
 that we can do better than we did in the 20th century.

05:31.240 --> 05:33.200
 You know, we mentioned offline this idea

05:33.200 --> 05:34.920
 of bringing people back to life

05:34.920 --> 05:38.240
 through artificial intelligence,

05:38.240 --> 05:40.880
 sort of, I don't know if you've seen videos

05:40.880 --> 05:45.200
 of basically animating people back to life,

05:45.200 --> 05:47.960
 meaning whether it's, for me personally,

05:47.960 --> 05:51.600
 I've been working on specifically about Albert Einstein,

05:51.600 --> 05:55.760
 but also Alan Turing, Isaac Newton, and Richard Feynman.

05:56.740 --> 05:59.520
 And it's an opportunity to bring people

05:59.520 --> 06:02.360
 that meant a lot to others in the world

06:02.360 --> 06:06.240
 and animate them and be able to have a conversation

06:06.240 --> 06:10.300
 with them at first to try to visually,

06:12.740 --> 06:17.200
 visually explore the full richness of character

06:17.200 --> 06:18.800
 that they had as they struggle

06:18.800 --> 06:20.880
 with the ideas of the modern age.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.120
 Sort of, it's less about bringing back their mind

06:24.120 --> 06:27.440
 and more bringing back the visual quirks

06:27.440 --> 06:28.960
 that made them who they are.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.960
 And then maybe in the future,

06:30.960 --> 06:33.200
 it's using the textual, the visual,

06:33.200 --> 06:38.200
 the video, the audio data to actually compress

06:38.600 --> 06:41.080
 down the person for who they are

06:41.080 --> 06:42.460
 and be able to generate text.

06:42.460 --> 06:44.520
 There's a few companies, there's Replica,

06:44.520 --> 06:46.920
 which is a chat engine that was born

06:46.920 --> 06:48.460
 out of the idea of bringing,

06:48.460 --> 06:53.440
 the founder lost her friend to,

06:53.440 --> 06:55.840
 he got run over by a car.

06:55.840 --> 06:59.740
 And the initial reason she founded the company

06:59.740 --> 07:02.840
 was trying to just have a conversation with her friend.

07:02.840 --> 07:07.400
 She trained machine learning, natural language system

07:07.400 --> 07:09.480
 on the texts that they exchange with each other

07:09.480 --> 07:11.880
 and try, she had a conversation with him

07:11.880 --> 07:13.880
 sort of after he was gone.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.880
 And it's very, the conversation was very trivial.

07:16.880 --> 07:21.200
 It was obvious that it's AI agent,

07:21.200 --> 07:23.200
 but it gave her solace.

07:23.200 --> 07:26.080
 It made her actually feel really good.

07:26.080 --> 07:27.920
 And that's the way I wonder if it's possible

07:27.920 --> 07:30.840
 to bring back people that are,

07:30.840 --> 07:32.520
 that mean something to us personally,

07:32.520 --> 07:36.640
 not just Einstein, but people that we've lost

07:36.640 --> 07:40.480
 and in that way achieve a kind of small

07:40.480 --> 07:42.680
 artificial immortality.

07:42.680 --> 07:44.700
 I don't know if you think about this kind of stuff.

07:44.700 --> 07:46.800
 Well, I definitely think about a lot of things.

07:46.800 --> 07:47.640
 That one's a really good one.

07:47.640 --> 07:49.160
 There's a great Black Mirror episode

07:49.160 --> 07:52.840
 about the wife who brings back the boyfriend or husband.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.280
 I think one of the challenges

07:54.280 --> 07:55.520
 with bringing back Richard Feynman

07:55.520 --> 07:58.080
 would be to capture his sense of humor,

07:58.080 --> 07:59.300
 but that would be awesome.

07:59.300 --> 08:00.940
 But yeah, bringing back loved ones would be great,

08:00.940 --> 08:05.940
 especially if they're young and they die early,

08:07.680 --> 08:09.180
 though it may hold you back from moving on.

08:09.180 --> 08:11.840
 That's another thing that could happen as a negative.

08:11.840 --> 08:12.680
 But I think that's great.

08:12.680 --> 08:14.680
 And I also think that it's gonna be possible,

08:14.680 --> 08:17.260
 especially when we're recording some of us,

08:17.260 --> 08:18.440
 every aspect of our lives,

08:18.440 --> 08:22.600
 whether it's our face or things we see, right?

08:22.600 --> 08:26.040
 Eventually one day, everything we see can be recorded.

08:26.040 --> 08:28.980
 And then you can build somebody's experience

08:28.980 --> 08:31.840
 and thoughts, speech,

08:31.840 --> 08:35.000
 and you will have replicas of everybody,

08:35.000 --> 08:36.440
 at least digitally,

08:36.440 --> 08:38.740
 and physically you could do that too one day.

08:38.740 --> 08:40.360
 But that's a good idea,

08:40.360 --> 08:42.640
 especially because there are people that I'd like to meet,

08:42.640 --> 08:44.940
 and I think it's easier than building a time machine.

08:44.940 --> 08:47.320
 One person I'd love to meet is Benjamin Franklin.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.160
 Really?

08:48.160 --> 08:50.720
 Well, I wouldn't go back in time.

08:50.720 --> 08:53.140
 I would, but I'd prefer to bring him into the future

08:53.140 --> 08:57.040
 and say, can you believe we have this thinking machine

08:57.040 --> 08:58.420
 in our pockets now?

08:58.420 --> 09:00.240
 And just see the look on his face

09:00.240 --> 09:01.320
 as to where humanity has come.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.480
 Because I think of him as a modern guy

09:03.480 --> 09:05.480
 that just was before his time.

09:05.480 --> 09:08.520
 Yeah, so you're thinking Benjamin Franklin the scientist,

09:08.520 --> 09:10.400
 not Benjamin Franklin the political thing.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.040
 Because he'd be very upset with Congress right now.

09:13.040 --> 09:13.880
 Right.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.160
 So maybe talk to him about science and technology,

09:16.160 --> 09:18.160
 not politics.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.600
 Or maybe just don't get him on Twitter

09:19.600 --> 09:22.400
 because he'll be very upset with human civilization.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.360
 You know, I wonder what their personalities are like.

09:25.360 --> 09:28.640
 Isaac Newton, it does seem complicated

09:28.640 --> 09:30.480
 to figure out what their personality is like.

09:30.480 --> 09:33.320
 Even Friedrich Nietzsche, who I also thought about.

09:33.320 --> 09:36.800
 Feynman is, we just have enough video

09:36.800 --> 09:39.360
 where we get the full kind of,

09:39.360 --> 09:42.440
 I mean, it shows you how important it is

09:42.440 --> 09:47.440
 to get not the official kind of book level presentation

09:47.560 --> 09:49.560
 of a human, but the authentic,

09:49.560 --> 09:51.960
 the full spectrum of humanity.

09:51.960 --> 09:54.420
 You mentioned collecting data about a person,

09:54.420 --> 09:57.280
 collecting the whole thing, the whole of life,

09:57.280 --> 09:59.480
 the ups and downs, the embarrassing stuff,

09:59.480 --> 10:01.600
 the beautiful stuff, not just the things

10:01.600 --> 10:03.160
 that's condensed into a book.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.880
 And then with Feynman, you start to see that a little bit.

10:05.880 --> 10:07.940
 Through conversations, you start to see peaks

10:07.940 --> 10:09.240
 of like that genius.

10:09.240 --> 10:12.920
 And then through stories about him from others.

10:12.920 --> 10:15.680
 And then certainly you, the sad thing

10:15.680 --> 10:17.720
 about Alan Turing, for example,

10:17.720 --> 10:22.240
 is there's very little, if any, recording of him.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.160
 In fact, I haven't been able to find recording

10:24.160 --> 10:27.440
 allegedly there's supposed to be a recording of him

10:27.440 --> 10:29.720
 doing some kind of a radio broadcast,

10:29.720 --> 10:32.120
 but I haven't been able to find anything.

10:32.120 --> 10:35.680
 And so that's truly sad that it feels like

10:35.680 --> 10:40.360
 it makes you realize how the upside,

10:40.360 --> 10:44.000
 how nice it is to collect data about a person,

10:44.000 --> 10:46.280
 to capture that person.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.740
 That's the upside of the modern internet age,

10:48.740 --> 10:51.340
 the digital age, that that information,

10:51.340 --> 10:54.200
 yeah, creates a kind of immortality.

10:55.700 --> 10:57.100
 And then you can choose to highlight

10:57.100 --> 10:58.220
 the best parts of the person,

10:58.220 --> 11:00.580
 maybe throw away the ugly parts

11:00.580 --> 11:03.460
 and celebrate them even after they're gone.

11:03.460 --> 11:05.100
 So that's a really interesting opportunity.

11:05.100 --> 11:07.900
 You've also mentioned to me offline

11:07.900 --> 11:11.060
 that you're really excited about all the different wearables

11:11.060 --> 11:14.020
 and all the different ways we can collect information

11:14.020 --> 11:18.060
 about our bodies, about the whole thing.

11:18.060 --> 11:21.180
 What's most exciting to you in terms of collecting

11:21.180 --> 11:26.180
 the biological data about a human being?

11:27.860 --> 11:29.300
 Well, so I'm a biologist.

11:29.300 --> 11:33.120
 I find animals and humans as machines very interesting.

11:34.060 --> 11:36.500
 It's one of the reasons I didn't become an engineer

11:36.500 --> 11:37.340
 or a surgeon.

11:37.340 --> 11:39.580
 I wanted to understand how we actually are built.

11:40.580 --> 11:45.580
 And so I think a lot about machines merging with humans.

11:46.020 --> 11:49.020
 And the first of that are the bio wearables.

11:49.020 --> 11:51.380
 And so I talked a lot about this, I wrote about it

11:51.380 --> 11:54.120
 in Lifespan, the book, and pictured a future

11:54.120 --> 11:56.860
 where you would be monitored constantly

11:56.860 --> 11:59.280
 so that you wouldn't suddenly have a heart attack,

11:59.280 --> 12:00.220
 you'd know that was coming,

12:00.220 --> 12:02.620
 or you wouldn't go to the doctor

12:02.620 --> 12:05.660
 and they don't know if you need an antibiotic or not.

12:07.540 --> 12:09.980
 Long term, how old are you, how to fix things,

12:09.980 --> 12:11.540
 what should you eat, what should you take,

12:11.540 --> 12:12.980
 what should your doctor do?

12:12.980 --> 12:16.100
 These devices, I predicted, would be smarter,

12:16.100 --> 12:18.100
 better educated than your physician

12:18.100 --> 12:19.700
 and would augment them.

12:19.700 --> 12:21.460
 And then there'd be a human that would just tick off

12:21.460 --> 12:24.300
 to see if it's correct and they approve.

12:24.300 --> 12:26.820
 I also was predicting in the book

12:26.820 --> 12:30.180
 that we would have video conferences with our doctors

12:30.180 --> 12:32.020
 and that medicines would be delivered,

12:32.020 --> 12:33.940
 initially by courier, but eventually by drones

12:33.940 --> 12:36.220
 and get it to you sometimes in an emergency.

12:36.220 --> 12:37.980
 And that we could even have pills

12:37.980 --> 12:41.820
 that were synthesized or delivered in your kitchen

12:41.820 --> 12:43.920
 and combined certainly.

12:43.920 --> 12:47.100
 What's amazing about that is that, what are we now,

12:47.100 --> 12:50.180
 two years since the book came out, even less,

12:50.180 --> 12:52.380
 and that future is basically here already.

12:52.380 --> 12:56.860
 COVID 19 accelerated that incredibly.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.480
 So where we're at now in society is,

12:58.480 --> 13:00.620
 if you wanna pay for it, you can have a blood test

13:00.620 --> 13:03.580
 that will detect cancer 10, 20 years earlier than it would

13:03.580 --> 13:05.340
 before it forms a tumor.

13:05.340 --> 13:07.940
 You can, of course, do your genome very cheaply

13:07.940 --> 13:09.380
 for less than $100 now.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.960
 There are bio wearables already I wear,

13:12.960 --> 13:17.180
 this ring from Aura that I have a number of years of data.

13:17.180 --> 13:19.220
 I've been doing blood tests for the last 12 years

13:19.220 --> 13:22.580
 with a company called Inside Tracker, which I consult for.

13:22.580 --> 13:24.220
 And so I have all of that data as well.

13:24.220 --> 13:27.700
 And there's 34 different parameters on my testosterone,

13:27.700 --> 13:30.020
 my blood glucose, my inflammation.

13:30.020 --> 13:32.700
 And I use all that data to, of course,

13:32.700 --> 13:34.720
 I wear a watch that measures things as well.

13:34.720 --> 13:39.280
 I use that data to keep my body in optimal shape.

13:39.280 --> 13:40.660
 So I'm now 51.

13:40.660 --> 13:42.140
 And according to those parameters,

13:42.140 --> 13:45.740
 I'm at least as good as someone in their early 40s.

13:45.740 --> 13:47.200
 And if I really work at it,

13:47.200 --> 13:52.020
 I can get my biochemistry down to early to mid 30s,

13:52.020 --> 13:56.220
 though I like to now eat a little dessert once in a while.

13:56.220 --> 13:58.700
 So that's the future we're in right now.

13:58.700 --> 14:00.900
 Anyone can do what I just said.

14:00.900 --> 14:04.340
 But in the very near future, just in the next few years,

14:04.340 --> 14:06.380
 you can be wearing wearables.

14:06.380 --> 14:08.540
 So I'm currently wearing a little,

14:08.540 --> 14:10.960
 what's called a bio sticker.

14:10.960 --> 14:14.100
 This one I just put on last night.

14:14.100 --> 14:18.580
 It's about an inch long, a few millimeters.

14:18.580 --> 14:21.660
 Yeah, for people just listening, it's on David's chest.

14:21.660 --> 14:23.180
 It's just, how does it attach?

14:23.180 --> 14:24.300
 It's just kind of.

14:24.300 --> 14:25.380
 It sticks on. Sticks on.

14:25.380 --> 14:27.740
 Yeah, so on one side you have an on button that you press.

14:27.740 --> 14:30.500
 The lights come on, flashes four times, it's good to go.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.980
 It immediately syncs to your phone.

14:32.980 --> 14:37.260
 And this one, it's called a bio button, a nice name.

14:37.260 --> 14:39.460
 And there's another one that I have that I haven't tried yet

14:39.460 --> 14:41.500
 that does EKG on your heart.

14:41.500 --> 14:43.380
 This is mainly for doctors to monitor patients

14:43.380 --> 14:45.620
 that go home after a heart attack or surgery.

14:45.620 --> 14:48.940
 But that's medical grade FDA approved device.

14:48.940 --> 14:51.260
 So there will be a day, in fact, it's already here,

14:51.260 --> 14:55.260
 that doctors are using these to get patients to go home

14:55.260 --> 14:59.460
 and save a week in hospital, $2,000 at least

14:59.460 --> 15:00.940
 for each patient.

15:00.940 --> 15:04.460
 That's massive savings for the hospital.

15:04.460 --> 15:06.580
 But ultimately what I'm excited about is a future

15:06.580 --> 15:10.760
 that isn't that far off where everybody,

15:10.760 --> 15:11.780
 certainly in developed countries,

15:11.780 --> 15:14.340
 eventually these will cost a few cents and rechargeable.

15:14.340 --> 15:16.620
 The only cost will be the software subscription

15:16.620 --> 15:19.220
 that can be monitored constantly.

15:19.220 --> 15:21.020
 And to give an idea what this is measuring me

15:21.020 --> 15:26.020
 at a thousand times a second is my vibrations as I speak,

15:26.220 --> 15:29.580
 my orientation, it already has told me this morning

15:29.580 --> 15:33.220
 how I slept, where I slept, what side I slept on.

15:33.220 --> 15:37.000
 We've got sneezing, coughing, body temperature,

15:37.000 --> 15:40.840
 heart rate, heart of other parameters of the heart

15:40.840 --> 15:42.440
 that would indicate heart health.

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
 These data are being used to now to predict sickness.

15:49.880 --> 15:53.640
 So eventually we'll have just in the next year or so

15:53.640 --> 15:55.520
 the ability to predict whether something

15:55.520 --> 15:58.160
 or diagnose whether something is pneumonia

15:58.160 --> 16:02.840
 or just a rhinovirus that can be treated or not.

16:02.840 --> 16:06.360
 This is really going to not just revolutionize medicine,

16:06.360 --> 16:08.480
 but I think extend lives dramatically.

16:08.480 --> 16:11.520
 Because if I'm gonna have a heart attack next week

16:11.520 --> 16:14.440
 and that's possible, this device should know that

16:14.440 --> 16:16.960
 and I'll be in hospital before I even have it.

16:16.960 --> 16:19.280
 Maybe you can talk a little bit about InsideTracker

16:19.280 --> 16:23.000
 because I saw that there's some really cool things in there.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.960
 Like it actually, so maybe you can talk about,

16:25.960 --> 16:29.240
 I guess that you're collecting blood to give it the data.

16:29.240 --> 16:32.480
 So, and it has like basic recommendations

16:32.480 --> 16:34.200
 on how to improve your life.

16:34.200 --> 16:36.560
 So we're not just talking about diseases, right?

16:36.560 --> 16:39.080
 Like anticipating having a particular disease,

16:39.080 --> 16:41.840
 but it's almost like guiding your trajectory to life,

16:41.840 --> 16:44.600
 how to, whether it's extend your life

16:44.600 --> 16:46.680
 or just live a more fulfilling,

16:46.680 --> 16:48.160
 like improve the quality of life.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.600
 I suppose this is the right way to say it.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.460
 How does InsideTracker work?

16:52.460 --> 16:53.300
 What the heck is it?

16:53.300 --> 16:55.080
 Because I thought there was also pretty cool.

16:55.080 --> 16:55.920
 Yeah.

16:55.920 --> 16:56.760
 What is it?

16:56.760 --> 16:58.240
 Is it something other people can use?

16:58.240 --> 16:59.720
 You can definitely use it.

16:59.720 --> 17:02.040
 You can sign up, it's consumer.

17:02.040 --> 17:04.440
 It's like a company consumer facing company.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.040
 It is, yeah.

17:06.040 --> 17:08.960
 And I also want to democratize the ability

17:08.960 --> 17:11.000
 to just take a mouth swab eventually.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.560
 We don't need to have a blood test necessarily,

17:13.560 --> 17:14.640
 but for now it's a blood test

17:14.640 --> 17:18.380
 and you'd go to a lab core request in the US.

17:18.380 --> 17:19.840
 It's also available overseas.

17:19.840 --> 17:22.540
 You can upload your own data for a minimal cost

17:22.540 --> 17:26.560
 and get the algorithms, the AI in the background

17:26.560 --> 17:27.880
 to take that data,

17:27.880 --> 17:31.560
 plot where you are against others in your age group

17:31.560 --> 17:34.120
 in terms of health and longevity at bio age.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.000
 They call it inner age,

17:36.000 --> 17:38.120
 but also it provides recommendations.

17:38.120 --> 17:39.640
 And this isn't just a bunch of BS.

17:39.640 --> 17:42.520
 It sounds like it might be to say, I'll go eat this

17:42.520 --> 17:44.360
 or go to that restaurant and order that,

17:44.360 --> 17:47.000
 but it's actually based on the basic.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.800
 This company has entered hundreds.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.760
 Now it would be thousands of scientific papers

17:51.760 --> 17:53.160
 into their database

17:53.160 --> 17:55.720
 and hundreds of thousands of human data points.

17:55.720 --> 17:59.040
 And they have tens of thousands of individuals

17:59.040 --> 18:00.360
 that have been tracked over time

18:00.360 --> 18:02.920
 and anonymously that data is used to say

18:02.920 --> 18:04.240
 what works and what doesn't.

18:04.240 --> 18:05.720
 If you eat that, what works?

18:05.720 --> 18:07.600
 If you take that supplement, what works?

18:07.600 --> 18:09.620
 And I was a coauthor on a paper that showed

18:09.620 --> 18:13.440
 that the recommendations for food and supplements

18:15.040 --> 18:18.040
 was better than the leading drug for type two diabetes.

18:18.920 --> 18:19.760
 That's so cool.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.660
 The idea that you can connect,

18:21.660 --> 18:24.880
 like skipping the human having to do this work,

18:24.880 --> 18:27.380
 you can connect the scientific papers,

18:27.380 --> 18:30.080
 almost like meta analysis of the science

18:30.080 --> 18:32.480
 connected to the individual data.

18:32.480 --> 18:35.400
 And then based on that sort of connect your data

18:35.400 --> 18:37.880
 to whatever the proper group is

18:37.880 --> 18:40.440
 within the whatever the scientific paper is

18:40.440 --> 18:44.840
 to make the suggestion of how like how that work

18:44.840 --> 18:47.120
 applies to your life.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.640
 And then that ultimately maps to like a recommendation

18:49.640 --> 18:51.240
 of what you should do with your life.

18:51.240 --> 18:54.520
 Like it all like this giant system

18:54.520 --> 18:55.700
 that ultimately recommends

18:55.700 --> 18:58.440
 you should drink more coffee or less.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.280
 Right, and we'll have the genome in there as well.

19:00.280 --> 19:01.200
 You can upload that.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.440
 Yeah, it's awesome.

19:02.440 --> 19:04.640
 So these programs will know us way better

19:04.640 --> 19:07.480
 than we do and our doctors as well.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.960
 The idea of going to a doctor once a year

19:08.960 --> 19:11.940
 for an annual checkup and having males get a finger

19:11.940 --> 19:16.000
 up their butt and you cough, that to me is a joke.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.140
 That's medieval medicine.

19:18.140 --> 19:21.440
 And that's very soon going to be seen as medieval.

19:21.440 --> 19:25.920
 Yeah, to me as a computer science person,

19:25.920 --> 19:28.640
 it's always upsetting to go to the doctor

19:28.640 --> 19:31.120
 and just look at him and like realize

19:31.120 --> 19:33.160
 you know nothing about me.

19:33.160 --> 19:38.160
 Like you're making your like opinions based on like,

19:38.560 --> 19:42.540
 it is very valuable, years of intuition building

19:42.540 --> 19:45.880
 about basic symptoms, but you're just like it is medieval.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.200
 They're very good at it.

19:47.200 --> 19:51.360
 In fact, doctors in medieval times were probably damn good

19:51.360 --> 19:53.600
 at working with very little.

19:53.600 --> 19:58.520
 But the thing is, I'd rather prefer a doctor

19:58.520 --> 20:00.040
 that doesn't really know what they're doing,

20:00.040 --> 20:02.200
 but has a huge amount of data to work with.

20:03.080 --> 20:03.920
 Well, you're right.

20:03.920 --> 20:05.600
 And many of my good friends are doctors.

20:05.600 --> 20:06.520
 I work at Harvard.

20:06.520 --> 20:09.640
 So I'm not against the profession at all.

20:09.640 --> 20:11.680
 But I think that they need just as much help

20:11.680 --> 20:13.480
 as anyone else does.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.320
 We wouldn't drive a car without a dashboard.

20:15.320 --> 20:16.140
 We wouldn't think of it.

20:16.140 --> 20:18.720
 So why would doctors do the same?

20:18.720 --> 20:21.400
 If we could, could we step back to the big,

20:21.400 --> 20:23.680
 profound, philosophical, both tragic

20:23.680 --> 20:25.500
 and beautiful question about age?

20:26.360 --> 20:28.700
 How and why do we age?

20:28.700 --> 20:31.520
 Is it from an engineering perspective?

20:31.520 --> 20:33.720
 You said you like the biological machine.

20:33.720 --> 20:37.760
 Is that a feature or a bug of the biological machine?

20:37.760 --> 20:40.720
 It is both a bug and a feature.

20:40.720 --> 20:44.640
 Evolutionary speaking, we only live as long as we need to

20:44.640 --> 20:46.280
 to replace ourselves efficiently.

20:47.360 --> 20:49.320
 If you're a mouse, you're only gonna live two

20:49.320 --> 20:50.600
 and a half years, three years.

20:50.600 --> 20:51.880
 You're probably gonna die of starvation,

20:51.880 --> 20:54.440
 predation, freezing in the winter.

20:54.440 --> 20:57.120
 So they divert most of their resources

20:57.120 --> 20:59.320
 to reproducing rapidly,

20:59.320 --> 21:00.960
 but they don't put a lot of energy

21:00.960 --> 21:04.320
 into preserving their soma, which is their body.

21:04.320 --> 21:06.640
 Conversely, a baleen type of whale,

21:06.640 --> 21:09.320
 a bowhead whale in particular will live hundreds of years

21:09.320 --> 21:11.060
 because they're at the top of the food chain

21:11.060 --> 21:12.640
 and they can live as long as they want.

21:12.640 --> 21:15.120
 So they breed slowly and build a body that lasts.

21:15.120 --> 21:17.400
 We're somewhere in between because we've, you know,

21:17.400 --> 21:19.680
 we've really only just come out of the savannas

21:19.680 --> 21:22.080
 where we could be picked off by a cat.

21:22.080 --> 21:25.400
 We were pretty wimpy going back 6 million years ago.

21:25.400 --> 21:30.080
 So we actually need to evolve quicker than evolution will.

21:30.080 --> 21:33.560
 And that's why we can use our oversized brains

21:33.560 --> 21:36.140
 and intuition to give us what evolution

21:36.140 --> 21:38.280
 not only didn't give us, but took away from us.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.680
 Now we're pathetic, look at our bodies.

21:40.680 --> 21:42.920
 These arms, if any of us, even the strongest person

21:42.920 --> 21:45.000
 in the world went in a cage with a chimpanzee,

21:45.000 --> 21:47.400
 the chimp could knock that person's head off, no question.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.240
 So we're pathetic.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.280
 So we need to engineer ourselves to be healthier

21:50.280 --> 21:51.580
 and longer lived.

21:51.580 --> 21:55.680
 So getting to aging, we can do better, right?

21:55.680 --> 21:57.260
 Whales do way better.

21:57.260 --> 21:59.500
 We're trying to learn how whales do that.

21:59.500 --> 22:03.300
 And if you ask really anybody in the field now, professor,

22:03.300 --> 22:07.360
 they'll say there are eight or nine hallmarks of aging,

22:07.360 --> 22:11.520
 which are really, it's a word for causes of aging.

22:11.520 --> 22:13.500
 So that you probably have heard of some of these,

22:13.500 --> 22:16.600
 your listeners will have loss of telomeres,

22:16.600 --> 22:19.600
 the ends of the chromosomes, like the little ends

22:19.600 --> 22:21.880
 of shoelaces, that kind of thing.

22:21.880 --> 22:24.880
 They get too short, cells stop dividing, become senescent.

22:24.880 --> 22:28.560
 They become, they put out what are called mitogens

22:28.560 --> 22:31.040
 that cause cancer and inflammatory molecules.

22:31.040 --> 22:34.280
 So that's another aspect of aging, cellular senescence.

22:34.280 --> 22:35.880
 Another one is loss of the energetic.

22:35.880 --> 22:38.680
 So mitochondria, the battery packs wind down.

22:39.720 --> 22:43.080
 There's a whole bunch, stem cells, proteostasis.

22:43.080 --> 22:45.440
 Well, these are our Achilles heels that I'm talking about.

22:45.440 --> 22:48.400
 They're a common amongst all life forms, really.

22:48.400 --> 22:51.640
 But if you want me to jump to the chases to where,

22:51.640 --> 22:54.400
 what is the upstream defining factor?

22:54.400 --> 22:57.300
 If we boil it down, what do we get?

22:57.300 --> 22:59.700
 So most biologists would say, you can't boil it down.

22:59.700 --> 23:01.200
 It's too complex.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.640
 I would say you can boil it down to an equation,

23:03.640 --> 23:05.860
 which is the preservation of information

23:05.860 --> 23:09.040
 and loss due to entropy, i.e. noise.

23:09.040 --> 23:11.100
 And that is the basis of my research.

23:12.380 --> 23:14.820
 It originally came out of discoveries in yeast cells,

23:14.820 --> 23:17.240
 where I went to MIT in the 1990s.

23:17.240 --> 23:18.760
 You studied bread.

23:18.760 --> 23:20.200
 I kind of did.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.960
 I studied the makers of bread,

23:22.960 --> 23:25.480
 a little yeast called Saccharomyces cerevisiae,

23:25.480 --> 23:29.200
 which at the time was one of the hottest, excuse the pun,

23:29.200 --> 23:30.920
 organisms to work on.

23:30.920 --> 23:35.300
 But we figured out in the lab why yeast cells get old

23:35.300 --> 23:37.440
 and found genes that control that process

23:37.440 --> 23:39.000
 and made them live longer,

23:39.000 --> 23:41.400
 which was an amazing four years of my life.

23:41.400 --> 23:46.400
 One of those genes had a name with an acronym SIR2.

23:48.200 --> 23:49.680
 Now the two is irrelevant.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.800
 The SIR is important.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.920
 And the most important letter out of all of those three

23:53.920 --> 23:56.960
 is I, which stands for information.

23:56.960 --> 23:59.620
 Silent information regulator number two,

23:59.620 --> 24:01.080
 when you put more copies of that gene in,

24:01.080 --> 24:02.760
 just put in one more copy,

24:02.760 --> 24:04.720
 the yeast cells lived 30% longer

24:04.720 --> 24:06.080
 and suppressed the cause of aging,

24:06.080 --> 24:09.000
 which was the dysregulation of information in the cell.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.640
 And then, so fast forward to now,

24:11.640 --> 24:14.600
 I've been looking in humans and mice,

24:14.600 --> 24:17.760
 because they live shorter and cheaper to study,

24:17.760 --> 24:20.780
 where the loss of information in our bodies

24:20.780 --> 24:22.580
 is a root cause of aging.

24:22.580 --> 24:24.040
 And I think it is.

24:24.040 --> 24:29.040
 Your boldness in doing biology in this way is fascinating

24:29.520 --> 24:31.840
 because that also leads to a kind of,

24:31.840 --> 24:36.840
 it's almost like allows for a theory of aging,

24:40.280 --> 24:43.080
 like you could boil it down to a single equation

24:43.080 --> 24:45.920
 and it leads to a, perhaps a metric

24:45.920 --> 24:48.620
 that allows you to optimize aging,

24:48.620 --> 24:51.280
 sort of in the fight against entropy.

24:51.280 --> 24:53.820
 I had to figure out which mechanisms, like you said,

24:53.820 --> 24:55.680
 the silent information regulator,

24:55.680 --> 24:58.560
 which mechanisms allow you to preserve information

24:58.560 --> 25:03.560
 without injecting noise, without creating entropy,

25:03.760 --> 25:06.120
 without creating degradation of that information.

25:07.000 --> 25:11.180
 For some reason, converting biology,

25:11.180 --> 25:13.520
 which I thought was mostly impossible

25:13.520 --> 25:15.680
 into an engineering problem,

25:15.680 --> 25:19.400
 feels like it makes it amenable to optimization,

25:19.400 --> 25:23.440
 to solving problems, to creating technology that can,

25:23.440 --> 25:26.680
 whether that's genetic engineering or AI,

25:26.680 --> 25:30.920
 it makes it possible to create the technology

25:30.920 --> 25:35.920
 that would improve the degradation of information and aging.

25:36.240 --> 25:38.160
 Is there more concrete ways you think

25:38.160 --> 25:41.440
 about the kind of information you want to preserve?

25:41.440 --> 25:46.120
 And also, is there good ideas about regulators

25:46.120 --> 25:51.120
 of that information, about ways to prevent the distortion,

25:52.400 --> 25:54.020
 the degradation of that information?

25:54.020 --> 25:56.580
 Right, so we have silent information regulator genes

25:56.580 --> 25:57.420
 in our bodies.

25:57.420 --> 26:00.360
 We have seven of them, SIRT1 through seven, they're called.

26:00.360 --> 26:03.200
 And we found in mice, one way to slow down

26:03.200 --> 26:05.900
 the loss of information is to just give more of these,

26:06.920 --> 26:08.440
 to upregulate these genes.

26:08.440 --> 26:12.000
 So we made a mouse that has more of this SIRT1 gene,

26:12.000 --> 26:15.160
 turned it on, and that slowed down the aging of the brain

26:15.160 --> 26:16.520
 and preserved their information.

26:16.520 --> 26:19.440
 Now, what information am I talking about, you might ask?

26:19.440 --> 26:22.000
 Well, again, you can simplify biology.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.100
 There are two types of information in the cell primarily.

26:25.100 --> 26:27.200
 The one we all read about and know about

26:27.200 --> 26:29.040
 is the DNA, the genome.

26:29.040 --> 26:32.440
 And that's base four information, ATCG,

26:32.440 --> 26:35.240
 the four chemicals that make up the various sequences

26:35.240 --> 26:37.000
 of the genome, billions of letters.

26:37.880 --> 26:39.960
 And that also degrades over time.

26:39.960 --> 26:42.600
 But what's been fascinating is that we find

26:42.600 --> 26:45.120
 that that information is pretty much intact

26:45.120 --> 26:47.280
 in old animals and people.

26:47.280 --> 26:48.240
 You can clone a dog.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.980
 One of my friends in LA just cloned his dog three times.

26:50.980 --> 26:52.080
 So this is doable, right?

26:52.080 --> 26:53.800
 It means that the genome can be intact.

26:53.800 --> 26:56.200
 But what's the other type of information?

26:56.200 --> 26:58.480
 It's the epigenome, the regulators

26:58.480 --> 27:01.220
 of the genetic information.

27:01.220 --> 27:04.380
 And physically, that's really just how the DNA is wrapped up

27:04.380 --> 27:08.040
 or looped out for the cell to access it and read it.

27:08.040 --> 27:11.200
 So it's similar to, and excuse this analogy,

27:11.200 --> 27:15.200
 but it's a good one, a compact disc or a DVD.

27:15.200 --> 27:18.480
 Those pits in the foil are the digital information.

27:18.480 --> 27:19.560
 That's the genome.

27:19.560 --> 27:22.240
 And the epigenome is the reader of that information.

27:22.240 --> 27:25.320
 And in a different cell, you'd read different music,

27:25.320 --> 27:28.000
 different songs, different symphonies.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.600
 And that's what gets laid down when we're in the womb.

27:31.600 --> 27:34.600
 And that makes a skin cell forever a skin cell

27:34.600 --> 27:36.360
 and not a brain cell tomorrow.

27:36.360 --> 27:38.760
 Thank God, otherwise our brains wouldn't work very well.

27:38.760 --> 27:41.200
 But over time, what we see is that the brain cells

27:41.200 --> 27:42.880
 start to look more like skin cells.

27:42.880 --> 27:45.620
 And the kidney cells start to look more like liver cells.

27:45.620 --> 27:48.120
 And what we call X differentiate.

27:48.120 --> 27:49.400
 This is a term that we use in my lab,

27:49.400 --> 27:52.080
 but isn't yet widely used.

27:52.080 --> 27:53.400
 But we needed a term to explain this.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.840
 And that process of X differentiation,

27:55.840 --> 28:00.840
 the loss of the reader of the CD or the DVD,

28:01.160 --> 28:06.160
 we liken that to scratches on the DVD

28:06.200 --> 28:09.440
 so that the reader cannot fully access the information.

28:09.440 --> 28:11.440
 Now we can slow down the scratches, as I mentioned.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.120
 We can turn on these genes.

28:13.120 --> 28:15.880
 We can even put in molecules into the cell

28:15.880 --> 28:18.960
 or even eat them and turn on those pathways,

28:18.960 --> 28:21.520
 which my father and I have been trying to do

28:21.520 --> 28:24.400
 for about a decade to slow things down.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.360
 But the question that I've had is,

28:27.360 --> 28:30.840
 is there a repository of information still in the body?

28:30.840 --> 28:32.240
 Because anyone who knows anything

28:32.240 --> 28:33.400
 about the loss of information

28:33.400 --> 28:35.520
 or even has tried to copy a cassette tape

28:35.520 --> 28:38.720
 or photocopy or Xerox anything knows that over time,

28:38.720 --> 28:41.760
 you lose that information irreparably.

28:41.760 --> 28:43.940
 So I've been looking for a backup copy,

28:43.940 --> 28:46.720
 inspired largely by Claude Shannon's work

28:46.720 --> 28:48.780
 at MIT as well in the 1940s.

28:48.780 --> 28:53.060
 His mathematical theory of communication is just brilliant.

28:53.060 --> 28:55.500
 And so I've been looking for what he called the observer,

28:55.500 --> 28:57.200
 which is the backup copy.

28:57.200 --> 29:01.500
 We today might call that the TCPIP protocol of the internet

29:01.500 --> 29:04.020
 that stores information in case it doesn't make it

29:04.020 --> 29:06.900
 to your computer, it will fill in the gaps.

29:06.900 --> 29:09.380
 And we've been spending about the last five years

29:09.380 --> 29:12.160
 to try and find if there really is a backup copy in the body

29:12.160 --> 29:15.960
 to reset the epigenome and polish those scratches away.

29:15.960 --> 29:16.940
 That's incredible.

29:16.940 --> 29:19.700
 So finding the backup, so whenever there are too many

29:19.700 --> 29:24.540
 scratches pile up, you can just write a new version.

29:24.540 --> 29:26.540
 Like write, not a new version,

29:26.540 --> 29:29.120
 but go to the backup and restore it.

29:29.120 --> 29:31.660
 Right, that's really all we're talking about.

29:31.660 --> 29:34.420
 It's not that hard once you know the trick.

29:34.420 --> 29:38.420
 And for people that actually remember like DVDs

29:38.420 --> 29:41.540
 and scratches on them, how frustrating it is.

29:41.540 --> 29:44.200
 That's a brilliant metaphor for aging.

29:44.200 --> 29:49.200
 And then the reader is the thing that skips

29:51.000 --> 29:53.400
 and then it could destroy your experience,

29:53.400 --> 29:55.800
 the richness of the experience that is listening

29:55.800 --> 29:57.160
 to your favorite song.

29:57.160 --> 29:59.000
 Right, but in biology, it's even worse

29:59.000 --> 30:01.120
 because you'll lose your memory, your kidneys will fail,

30:01.120 --> 30:03.640
 you'll get diabetes, your heart will fail.

30:03.640 --> 30:06.880
 And we call that aging and age related diseases.

30:06.880 --> 30:10.040
 So most people forget that diseases that we get

30:10.040 --> 30:13.860
 when we get old are 80 to 90% caused by aging.

30:13.860 --> 30:15.960
 And we've been trying to fix things with band aids

30:15.960 --> 30:19.040
 after they occur without even generally talking

30:19.040 --> 30:21.360
 about the root cause of the problem.

30:21.360 --> 30:26.240
 Is there the scratches, do those come from,

30:28.260 --> 30:31.880
 are those programmed or are they failures?

30:31.880 --> 30:36.440
 Meaning is it, so if it's by design,

30:36.440 --> 30:40.960
 then there's like a encoded timeline schedule

30:40.960 --> 30:43.000
 that the body's just on purpose,

30:43.000 --> 30:44.560
 degrading the whole thing.

30:44.560 --> 30:47.100
 And then there's the just the wear and tear

30:47.100 --> 30:50.400
 of like the scratches on a disc that happen through time.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.780
 Which one is it that's the source of aging?

30:54.240 --> 30:56.940
 It's more akin to wear and tear, there isn't a program.

30:56.940 --> 31:00.760
 Getting back to evolution, there's no selection for aging.

31:00.760 --> 31:03.600
 We're not designed to age, we just live as long as we need

31:03.600 --> 31:06.160
 to and then we're at the whim of entropy, basically.

31:06.160 --> 31:09.120
 Second law of thermodynamics, stuff falls apart.

31:09.120 --> 31:11.200
 We live a bit longer than age 40,

31:11.200 --> 31:13.420
 only because there are robust, resilient systems,

31:13.420 --> 31:15.320
 but eventually they fail as well.

31:15.320 --> 31:16.940
 Current limit to the human lifespan

31:16.940 --> 31:19.280
 where they completely fail is 122.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.240
 But I don't like to think of it as wear and tear

31:23.240 --> 31:25.880
 because there's two aspects to it.

31:25.880 --> 31:28.080
 There's a system that's built to keep us alive

31:28.080 --> 31:30.960
 when we're young, but actually goes,

31:30.960 --> 31:33.280
 comes back to bite us as we get older.

31:33.280 --> 31:37.800
 And we call this issue antagonistic pleiotropy.

31:37.800 --> 31:39.500
 What's good for you when you're young

31:39.500 --> 31:42.920
 can cause problems when you're older.

31:42.920 --> 31:46.160
 So we've been looking, what is the main causes of the noise?

31:46.160 --> 31:49.320
 And we've found two of them definitively.

31:49.320 --> 31:52.000
 The first one is broken chromosomes.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
 When a chromosome breaks, the cell has to panic

31:55.000 --> 31:58.280
 because that's either gonna cause a cancer or kill the cell.

31:58.280 --> 32:01.180
 There's only two outcomes, it's pretty much a problem.

32:01.180 --> 32:05.100
 And so what the cell does is it reorganizes the epigenome

32:05.100 --> 32:06.100
 in a massive way.

32:06.100 --> 32:09.740
 What that leads to is, think of it as a tennis match

32:09.740 --> 32:11.620
 or a ping pong game.

32:11.620 --> 32:13.100
 The proteins are the balls

32:13.100 --> 32:14.940
 and they now leave where they should be,

32:14.940 --> 32:18.140
 which is regulating the genes that make the cell type,

32:18.140 --> 32:18.980
 whatever it is.

32:18.980 --> 32:20.540
 And they have a dual function,

32:20.540 --> 32:22.100
 they actually go to the break,

32:22.100 --> 32:24.620
 the chromosome will break and fix that.

32:24.620 --> 32:26.020
 And then they come back.

32:26.900 --> 32:28.460
 You might ask, well, why is it set up that way?

32:28.460 --> 32:29.300
 Well, it's a beautiful system,

32:29.300 --> 32:30.940
 it coordinates gene expression,

32:30.940 --> 32:32.860
 the control systems with the repair.

32:32.860 --> 32:34.260
 You want them coordinated.

32:34.260 --> 32:36.580
 Problem is, as we get older, this ping pong game,

32:36.580 --> 32:37.700
 some of the balls get lost.

32:37.700 --> 32:40.660
 They don't come back to where they originally started.

32:40.660 --> 32:45.180
 And that's what we think is the main noise for aging.

32:45.180 --> 32:47.660
 And we've also, the other cause of aging that we found

32:47.660 --> 32:51.140
 is cell stress, we damage nerves and they age rapidly.

32:51.140 --> 32:52.860
 So that's the other issue.

32:52.860 --> 32:56.420
 There's probably others, smoking chemicals, for example,

32:56.420 --> 32:59.020
 we know accelerates biological age pretty dramatically.

33:00.380 --> 33:02.300
 But the question is, can you slow that down

33:02.300 --> 33:04.420
 or can you reset them to get those ping pong balls

33:04.420 --> 33:07.180
 to go back to where they originally started in the game?

33:07.180 --> 33:09.780
 And we think we've found a way to do that.

33:09.780 --> 33:11.820
 Can you give me hints?

33:11.820 --> 33:13.980
 Whose fault is it in the balls not coming back?

33:13.980 --> 33:15.780
 Is it the proteins themselves?

33:15.780 --> 33:18.140
 Like are they starting?

33:18.140 --> 33:20.300
 Again, I've been obsessed with the protein folding problem

33:20.300 --> 33:21.140
 from the AI perspective.

33:21.140 --> 33:23.700
 So is it the proteins or is it something else?

33:23.700 --> 33:27.300
 Well, we know who hits the balls and recruits them.

33:27.300 --> 33:31.300
 So that the break is recognized by the cell.

33:31.300 --> 33:34.140
 It's recognized by proteins who send out a signal

33:35.140 --> 33:38.940
 through phosphorylation is typical way cells talk

33:38.940 --> 33:40.980
 to other proteins.

33:40.980 --> 33:43.540
 And that recruits those repair factors,

33:43.540 --> 33:45.100
 those ping pong balls to the break.

33:45.100 --> 33:49.100
 So the cells actively doing this to try and help itself,

33:49.100 --> 33:53.940
 but we don't know who's to blame for them not coming back.

33:53.940 --> 33:58.460
 That could just be a flaw in the quote unquote design.

33:58.460 --> 34:00.300
 I don't think that there's something saying,

34:00.300 --> 34:04.180
 well, 1% of you balls proteins never go back.

34:04.180 --> 34:06.100
 I just think it's hard to reset a system

34:06.100 --> 34:07.660
 that's constantly changing.

34:07.660 --> 34:11.340
 We have in our bodies close to a trillion DNA breaks

34:11.340 --> 34:12.740
 every day.

34:12.740 --> 34:14.260
 And imagine that over 80 years,

34:14.260 --> 34:17.540
 what damage that does to our epigenomic information.

34:17.540 --> 34:20.260
 Now we know that this is, well,

34:20.260 --> 34:21.540
 we never know anything in biology,

34:21.540 --> 34:23.980
 but we have strong evidence that this is true

34:23.980 --> 34:27.580
 because we can mess with animals.

34:27.580 --> 34:30.060
 We can create DNA breaks and tickle them

34:30.060 --> 34:32.940
 with a few breaks, maybe raise it by threefold

34:32.940 --> 34:35.780
 over background levels of normal breakage.

34:35.780 --> 34:38.300
 And if we're right, those mice should get old.

34:39.260 --> 34:40.380
 And they do.

34:40.380 --> 34:42.420
 We can actually, we've created these breaks

34:42.420 --> 34:43.980
 in a way that's titratable.

34:43.980 --> 34:45.260
 We can, it's like a rheostat.

34:45.260 --> 34:47.380
 We can send it to 11.

34:47.380 --> 34:51.380
 I drove my Tesla here, I'm a big fan of a spinal tap too,

34:51.380 --> 34:52.420
 going to 11.

34:52.420 --> 34:54.180
 If we go to 11, we can make a mouse old

34:54.180 --> 34:55.740
 in a matter of months.

34:55.740 --> 34:58.620
 We prefer to go to a level of about four

34:58.620 --> 35:00.220
 and it gets old in 10 months.

35:00.220 --> 35:01.180
 But it's definitely old.

35:01.180 --> 35:03.740
 It's got all of the hallmarks of aging.

35:03.740 --> 35:05.220
 It's got diseases.

35:05.220 --> 35:06.060
 It looks old.

35:06.060 --> 35:06.900
 Its skin is old.

35:06.900 --> 35:08.060
 It's got gray hair.

35:08.060 --> 35:10.020
 But importantly, we can now measure age

35:10.020 --> 35:11.420
 by looking at the scratches.

35:11.420 --> 35:13.460
 We can look at the epigenome, we can measure it

35:13.460 --> 35:15.820
 and use machine learning to give us a number.

35:15.820 --> 35:19.180
 And those mice are 50% older than normal.

35:19.180 --> 35:21.860
 So you can replicate the aging process in a controlled way.

35:21.860 --> 35:24.460
 You can, I mean, in a way that, I mean,

35:24.460 --> 35:28.660
 you could accelerate it in a controlled way

35:28.660 --> 35:31.620
 and measure how much exactly it's aging.

35:31.620 --> 35:35.020
 And that gives you step one of a two step process

35:35.020 --> 35:36.580
 to when you can then figure out,

35:36.580 --> 35:38.020
 how can we reverse this?

35:38.020 --> 35:40.220
 And now we're reversing those mice.

35:40.220 --> 35:42.580
 Is there a good, I love what you said.

35:42.580 --> 35:45.380
 I mean, in biology, you really don't know.

35:45.380 --> 35:47.660
 It's such a beautiful mess.

35:48.540 --> 35:51.500
 Is there ideas how to do that?

35:51.500 --> 35:55.060
 Is that on the genetic engineering level?

35:55.060 --> 35:57.620
 Is it like, what can you mess with?

35:57.620 --> 36:02.300
 Is it going to the, trying to discover the backup copies

36:02.300 --> 36:04.220
 and restoring from them?

36:04.220 --> 36:06.380
 Like what's, if it's possible to convert it

36:06.380 --> 36:09.500
 to natural language words, what are the ideas here?

36:09.500 --> 36:11.500
 What is the observer and how do we contact it?

36:11.500 --> 36:12.340
 Exactly.

36:12.340 --> 36:14.340
 What's the observer and how do you contact?

36:14.340 --> 36:17.060
 Or if there's other ideas, how to reverse

36:17.060 --> 36:20.620
 the balls getting lost process.

36:20.620 --> 36:22.860
 Yeah, well, you can slow it down.

36:22.860 --> 36:23.700
 Slow it.

36:23.700 --> 36:26.260
 But we found a reset switch recently.

36:26.260 --> 36:31.260
 We just published this in the December 2020 issue of Nature.

36:33.060 --> 36:36.900
 And what we found is that there were three embryonic genes

36:36.900 --> 36:39.780
 that we could put into the adult animal

36:39.780 --> 36:42.020
 to reset the age of the tissues.

36:42.020 --> 36:44.700
 And it only takes four to eight weeks to work well.

36:44.700 --> 36:46.060
 And we can take a blind mouse

36:46.060 --> 36:48.340
 that's lost its vision due to aging.

36:48.340 --> 36:50.460
 Neurons aren't working well towards the brain.

36:50.460 --> 36:52.660
 Reset those neurons back to a younger age.

36:52.660 --> 36:54.220
 And now the mice can see again.

36:55.140 --> 36:57.220
 These three genes are famous actually

36:57.220 --> 36:59.500
 because they're a set of four genes

36:59.500 --> 37:01.700
 discovered by Shinya Yamanaka,

37:01.700 --> 37:04.020
 who won the Nobel Prize in 2016

37:04.020 --> 37:05.900
 for discovering that those four genes

37:05.900 --> 37:09.620
 when turned on at high levels in adult cells

37:09.620 --> 37:11.900
 can generate stem cells.

37:11.900 --> 37:14.060
 And this is, I think, well known now

37:14.060 --> 37:16.900
 that we can create stem cells from adult tissue.

37:16.900 --> 37:19.460
 But what wasn't known is can you partially take age back

37:19.460 --> 37:20.820
 without becoming a tumor

37:20.820 --> 37:22.540
 or generating a stem cell in the eye,

37:22.540 --> 37:24.100
 which would be a disaster?

37:24.100 --> 37:24.940
 And the answer is yes.

37:24.940 --> 37:26.620
 There is a system in the body

37:26.620 --> 37:29.060
 that can take the age of a cell back to a certain point,

37:29.060 --> 37:33.100
 but no further, safely, and reset the age.

37:33.100 --> 37:36.580
 And we're now using that to reset the age of the brain

37:36.580 --> 37:39.340
 of those mice that we aged prematurely.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.700
 And they're getting their ability to learn back.

37:42.580 --> 37:44.300
 This is really exciting, right?

37:44.300 --> 37:46.860
 Like what's the downside of this?

37:46.860 --> 37:49.260
 Well, the downside is if you overdo it

37:49.260 --> 37:52.220
 and you don't get it right, you might cause tumors.

37:53.380 --> 37:54.980
 But we do it very carefully.

37:54.980 --> 37:57.940
 And we also know that in the eye, it's very safe.

37:57.940 --> 38:01.660
 We also injected these, we deliver them by viruses.

38:01.660 --> 38:06.060
 So we can control where and when they get turned on.

38:07.020 --> 38:08.340
 And in this paper, we've published

38:08.340 --> 38:10.580
 that if we put high levels in the mouse,

38:10.580 --> 38:12.420
 into their veins, throughout the body,

38:12.420 --> 38:14.740
 they don't get cancer for over a year.

38:14.740 --> 38:18.660
 So I'm so optimistic that we're going into human studies

38:18.660 --> 38:20.460
 in less than two years from now.

38:20.460 --> 38:23.980
 Is there a place where AI can help?

38:23.980 --> 38:27.740
 Sorry to inject one of the things

38:27.740 --> 38:30.260
 I'm very excited about and passionate about.

38:30.260 --> 38:35.100
 So Google DeepMind recently had a big breakthrough

38:35.100 --> 38:39.140
 with AlphaFold2, but also AlphaFold two years ago,

38:39.140 --> 38:44.140
 with achieving sort of a state of the art performance

38:44.140 --> 38:47.260
 on the protein folding problem, single protein folding.

38:47.260 --> 38:50.300
 But it also paints a hopeful picture

38:50.300 --> 38:52.900
 of what's possible to do in terms of simulating

38:52.900 --> 38:54.180
 the folding of proteins,

38:54.180 --> 38:58.700
 but also simulating biological systems through AI.

38:58.700 --> 39:02.740
 Is there something to you, combined with this brilliant work

39:02.740 --> 39:05.940
 on the biology side that you're hopeful about

39:05.940 --> 39:08.300
 where AI can be a tool to help?

39:08.300 --> 39:09.580
 Where isn't it a tool?

39:09.580 --> 39:11.580
 I mean, if you're not using AI right now in biology,

39:11.580 --> 39:13.100
 you're getting less and less likely

39:13.100 --> 39:15.540
 to be left behind in biology, you're getting left behind.

39:15.540 --> 39:16.380
 We use it all the time.

39:16.380 --> 39:19.340
 We're using it to generate these biological clocks

39:19.340 --> 39:21.940
 to be able to read those scratches.

39:21.940 --> 39:24.700
 We're using it to predict the folding of proteins

39:24.700 --> 39:28.220
 so we can target molecules and modulate their activity.

39:28.220 --> 39:31.420
 We're using it to assemble genomes of different species.

39:31.420 --> 39:32.740
 What else?

39:32.740 --> 39:36.540
 We use it to predict the longevity of a mouse

39:36.540 --> 39:39.180
 based on how it reacts to certain things,

39:39.180 --> 39:41.860
 hearing, eyesight, generally frailty.

39:41.860 --> 39:43.860
 We just put out a paper last year on that.

39:45.660 --> 39:46.900
 The other thing we can use it for,

39:46.900 --> 39:49.100
 which is a little off the track here,

39:49.100 --> 39:51.300
 but we use it for predicting

39:51.300 --> 39:53.300
 which microorganisms are in your body,

39:53.300 --> 39:55.660
 actually not predicting, telling you.

39:55.660 --> 39:59.660
 So our daughter, Natalie, was infected with Lyme disease

39:59.660 --> 40:02.380
 a few years ago, almost went blind from it.

40:02.380 --> 40:03.740
 And the test took four days.

40:03.740 --> 40:06.900
 And I thought, just give me the DNA from her spinal fluid.

40:06.900 --> 40:07.900
 I'll go tell you what's in it.

40:07.900 --> 40:10.060
 If it's Lyme disease or not, they refused.

40:10.060 --> 40:12.580
 And so at that point I said, this has to be done better.

40:12.580 --> 40:15.740
 So I've started a company that now can take a sample

40:15.740 --> 40:17.260
 of any part of your body.

40:17.260 --> 40:21.620
 It's typically done now with liver transplant patients

40:21.620 --> 40:24.900
 to detect viruses that come out of their organs.

40:24.900 --> 40:28.380
 But that's another area that AI is extremely important for.

40:29.340 --> 40:31.460
 I think if you're not, in five years,

40:31.460 --> 40:35.340
 if you're not using deep learning, you've got a problem.

40:35.340 --> 40:36.900
 Because the amount of data that we generate now

40:36.900 --> 40:39.420
 as biologists is just terabytes.

40:39.420 --> 40:40.460
 It can be terabytes per week.

40:40.460 --> 40:42.300
 It'll eventually be terabytes per day.

40:42.300 --> 40:43.940
 And then we just go from there.

40:43.940 --> 40:46.300
 And I actually have trouble recruiting enough

40:46.300 --> 40:47.660
 bioinformaticians.

40:49.020 --> 40:51.260
 A lot of our work is now just number crunching.

40:52.420 --> 40:55.140
 A part of that is collecting the data,

40:55.140 --> 40:57.580
 which is kind of something we've talked a little bit about.

40:57.580 --> 41:00.540
 But is there something you can say about

41:00.540 --> 41:04.460
 how we can collect more and more data,

41:04.460 --> 41:07.580
 not just on the one person level,

41:07.580 --> 41:12.580
 like for you to understand your various markers,

41:13.220 --> 41:16.620
 but to create huge datasets

41:16.620 --> 41:20.460
 to understand how we can detect certain pathogens,

41:20.460 --> 41:22.660
 detect certain properties, characteristics

41:22.660 --> 41:25.580
 of whether it's aging or all the other ways

41:25.580 --> 41:27.140
 that the human body can fail.

41:27.140 --> 41:29.740
 It seems like with biology,

41:29.740 --> 41:33.420
 there's a kind of privacy concerns that,

41:33.420 --> 41:34.940
 well, actually not privacy concerns,

41:34.940 --> 41:38.420
 it's almost like regulation that kind of prevents

41:38.420 --> 41:40.340
 hospitals from sharing data.

41:42.820 --> 41:44.500
 I'm not sure exactly how to say it,

41:44.500 --> 41:48.260
 but it seems like when you look at autonomous vehicles,

41:48.260 --> 41:50.220
 people are much more willing to share data.

41:50.220 --> 41:52.580
 When you look at human biology system,

41:52.580 --> 41:54.380
 people are much less willing to share data.

41:54.380 --> 41:56.860
 Is there a hopeful path forward

41:56.860 --> 42:00.260
 where we can share more and more data at a large scale

42:00.260 --> 42:03.060
 that ultimately ends up helping us understand

42:03.060 --> 42:06.780
 the human body and then treat problems with the human body?

42:06.780 --> 42:08.300
 So we are right in the middle,

42:08.300 --> 42:10.140
 we're living through what's gonna be seen

42:10.140 --> 42:12.620
 as one of the biggest revolutions in human health,

42:12.620 --> 42:16.380
 through the gathering of data about our bodies.

42:16.380 --> 42:19.500
 And 20 years ago, people didn't wanna go on social media,

42:19.500 --> 42:21.300
 they're worried about it, now you have to,

42:21.300 --> 42:23.660
 if you're a kid, that's for sure.

42:23.660 --> 42:25.540
 Same with medical records,

42:25.540 --> 42:28.580
 these are becoming all digitized and expanded.

42:29.420 --> 42:32.580
 Ultimately, we're going to, even if we don't want to,

42:32.580 --> 42:34.780
 have to be monitored.

42:34.780 --> 42:36.980
 There's gonna be a court case that,

42:36.980 --> 42:39.740
 I bet two, three years from now, someone's gonna say,

42:39.740 --> 42:42.380
 how come my father died from a heart attack?

42:42.380 --> 42:45.740
 You had these biosensors, 20 bucks, and you didn't use it.

42:45.740 --> 42:47.460
 Lawsuit right there, and suddenly,

42:47.460 --> 42:49.460
 all hospitals have to give you one of these.

42:49.460 --> 42:51.780
 There'll be a reversal, like to where,

42:52.820 --> 42:54.780
 it's your fault if you don't collect the data,

42:54.780 --> 42:58.140
 that's brilliant, and that's absolutely right.

42:58.140 --> 43:00.780
 I mean, that's absolutely right.

43:00.780 --> 43:03.820
 That's the frustration I feel on going to the doctor,

43:03.820 --> 43:08.820
 is like, it's almost negligent to not collect the data,

43:10.540 --> 43:11.900
 because you're making,

43:11.900 --> 43:13.980
 there's something really wrong with me,

43:13.980 --> 43:17.900
 and you're making decisions based on very few tests,

43:17.900 --> 43:20.100
 that's almost negligent, when you have the opportunity

43:20.100 --> 43:21.980
 to collect a huge amount more data.

43:21.980 --> 43:23.540
 Well, let me tell you something.

43:23.540 --> 43:26.780
 Like, I've got this inside tracker data

43:26.780 --> 43:29.020
 for myself over a decade,

43:29.020 --> 43:31.780
 and you'd think my doctor would roll his eyes at this,

43:31.780 --> 43:34.740
 oh, he's gone to a consumer company, blah, blah, blah.

43:34.740 --> 43:37.340
 I had my first checkup in a year with him

43:37.340 --> 43:42.340
 through video conference, and he was running blind.

43:42.620 --> 43:45.340
 He really didn't know what was going on with me.

43:45.340 --> 43:46.340
 He asked the usual things.

43:46.340 --> 43:47.180
 How am I sleeping?

43:47.180 --> 43:48.540
 How am I eating?

43:48.540 --> 43:50.020
 These kind of usual things.

43:50.020 --> 43:52.300
 And I said, well, I've got new tests back

43:52.300 --> 43:54.380
 from inside tracker, and he said, great,

43:54.380 --> 43:55.860
 I'd love to see them.

43:55.860 --> 43:58.100
 So I share screen, and we look at the graphs,

43:58.100 --> 44:00.820
 look at the data, and he's loving it,

44:00.820 --> 44:04.460
 because he cannot order these tests willy nilly.

44:04.460 --> 44:08.940
 So I said, well, let's order a HbA1c blood glucose levels,

44:08.940 --> 44:10.100
 because I'm very interested in that.

44:10.100 --> 44:11.380
 That tracks with longevity.

44:11.380 --> 44:13.900
 And he said, well, I have no reason to order that.

44:13.900 --> 44:15.460
 Do you have a family history?

44:15.460 --> 44:16.300
 No.

44:17.460 --> 44:18.820
 Do you have any symptoms of diabetes?

44:18.820 --> 44:19.660
 No.

44:19.660 --> 44:20.620
 Well, I can't order the test.

44:20.620 --> 44:22.140
 I almost wanted to reach through the computer

44:22.140 --> 44:25.940
 and strangle him, but instead, I pay a little bit

44:25.940 --> 44:28.260
 to get these tests done, and then he looks at them.

44:28.260 --> 44:30.580
 So that's now the way consumer health is going,

44:30.580 --> 44:32.780
 is that you can get better data than your doctor can,

44:32.780 --> 44:34.460
 but they'd like you to do that.

44:34.460 --> 44:37.460
 Quick human question, maybe you can educate me.

44:39.100 --> 44:42.380
 I think doctors sometimes have a bit of an ego.

44:42.380 --> 44:44.660
 I understand that the doctors super experience

44:44.660 --> 44:47.580
 a lot of things, but this is a fundamental question

44:47.580 --> 44:49.220
 of human variability.

44:49.220 --> 44:52.740
 Like, I know a lot of specific details about like,

44:52.740 --> 44:54.620
 I mean, it depends, of course, what we're talking about,

44:54.620 --> 44:58.420
 but I bring a lot of knowledge, and if I have data with me,

44:58.420 --> 45:02.940
 then I have like several orders of magnitude more knowledge.

45:02.940 --> 45:05.460
 And I think there's an aspect to it where the doctor

45:05.460 --> 45:10.460
 has to put their expert hat, like take it off

45:11.900 --> 45:14.260
 and actually be a curious, open minded person

45:14.260 --> 45:16.500
 and study and look at that data.

45:16.500 --> 45:19.980
 Do you think it's possible to sort of change the culture

45:19.980 --> 45:22.780
 of the medical system to where the doctors are almost,

45:22.780 --> 45:25.700
 as you said, are excited to see the data?

45:25.700 --> 45:26.820
 Or is that already happening?

45:26.820 --> 45:27.660
 It's really happening.

45:27.660 --> 45:30.620
 Now, we've probably lost the last generation.

45:30.620 --> 45:34.500
 They're no hopers, but so I teach at Harvard Medical School

45:34.500 --> 45:35.980
 and they're excited about this.

45:35.980 --> 45:37.140
 They're excited about aging,

45:37.140 --> 45:39.580
 which is a new aspect to medicine.

45:39.580 --> 45:41.660
 Oh, wow, we can do something about that.

45:41.660 --> 45:43.900
 And then, yeah, all this data, what do we do with it?

45:43.900 --> 45:45.900
 There's still the traditional pathology and all that stuff,

45:45.900 --> 45:52.900
 which they need to know, but time will change their mindset.

45:52.900 --> 45:54.300
 I'm not worried about that.

45:54.300 --> 45:57.340
 And like we were discussing, this isn't a question of if,

45:57.340 --> 45:58.980
 it's just a matter of when.

45:58.980 --> 46:02.260
 And I have a front row seat on all of this.

46:02.260 --> 46:07.420
 I had breakfast with a CEO who is making this happen

46:07.420 --> 46:09.540
 just yesterday.

46:09.540 --> 46:12.740
 I can tell you for sure that most people have no idea

46:12.740 --> 46:14.580
 that this revolution is occurring

46:14.580 --> 46:17.220
 and is happening so quickly.

46:17.220 --> 46:19.780
 If you're running a hospital and you can save $2,000

46:19.780 --> 46:22.380
 per cardiac patient, what are you going to do?

46:22.380 --> 46:23.340
 You have to use it.

46:23.340 --> 46:25.540
 Otherwise, the hospital down the road

46:25.540 --> 46:28.380
 is going to be beating you.

46:28.380 --> 46:30.820
 And there are large hospital aggregations,

46:30.820 --> 46:32.860
 so there's Ascension and others,

46:32.860 --> 46:37.500
 that just have to go this way for budgetary reasons.

46:37.500 --> 46:43.660
 And right now, the US spends 17% of their GDP on healthcare.

46:43.660 --> 46:45.860
 Let's say one of these buttons on my chest costs $20.

46:45.860 --> 46:47.220
 It's rechargeable.

46:47.220 --> 46:48.620
 And it can predict people's health

46:48.620 --> 46:52.820
 and save on antibiotics to prevent heart attacks.

46:52.820 --> 46:54.940
 How many billions, if not trillions of dollars,

46:54.940 --> 46:58.380
 will that save over the next decade?

46:58.380 --> 47:00.220
 Yeah, so when the public wakes up to this,

47:00.220 --> 47:01.460
 they'll almost demand it.

47:01.460 --> 47:04.020
 Like, this should be accepted everywhere.

47:04.020 --> 47:04.980
 This is obvious.

47:04.980 --> 47:05.980
 It's going to save a lot of money.

47:05.980 --> 47:07.620
 It's going to improve the quality of life.

47:07.620 --> 47:11.460
 Well, and the CFOs of hospital groups will have to.

47:11.460 --> 47:15.700
 And insurance companies are going to want to get in on this.

47:15.700 --> 47:17.620
 So now that gets to privacy, right?

47:17.620 --> 47:20.460
 Should an insurance company have access to your data?

47:20.460 --> 47:21.700
 I would say no.

47:21.700 --> 47:24.100
 But you could voluntarily show them some of it

47:24.100 --> 47:25.500
 if they give you a discount.

47:25.500 --> 47:28.980
 And that's also being worked on right now.

47:28.980 --> 47:30.900
 I hope we do create kind of systems

47:30.900 --> 47:33.180
 where I can volunteer to share my data

47:33.180 --> 47:35.780
 and I can also take the data back,

47:35.780 --> 47:39.060
 meaning like delete the data, request deletion of data.

47:39.060 --> 47:41.460
 And then maybe policy creates rules

47:41.460 --> 47:45.020
 to where you can share data, you could delete the data.

47:45.020 --> 47:50.020
 And I think if I have the option to delete all my data

47:50.700 --> 47:52.700
 that a particular company has,

47:52.700 --> 47:54.500
 then I'll share my data with everyone.

47:55.900 --> 48:00.900
 I feel like if, because that gives me the tools

48:01.340 --> 48:04.580
 to be a consumer, an intelligent consumer,

48:04.580 --> 48:08.700
 of awarding my data to a company that deserves it

48:08.700 --> 48:11.260
 and taking it back when the company is misbehaving.

48:11.260 --> 48:13.460
 And in that way, encourage,

48:13.460 --> 48:15.780
 as a consumer in the capitalist system,

48:15.780 --> 48:18.740
 encourage the companies that are doing great work

48:18.740 --> 48:20.300
 with that data.

48:20.300 --> 48:24.220
 Well, yeah, healthcare data security is number one.

48:24.220 --> 48:27.780
 On my mind, InsideTracker made sure that that was true.

48:27.780 --> 48:31.180
 But these buttons on your chest,

48:31.180 --> 48:33.740
 there's very private stuff they can probably tell

48:33.740 --> 48:35.580
 if you're having sex one night, right?

48:35.580 --> 48:37.860
 So this is not the kind of stuff you want leaked.

48:37.860 --> 48:39.580
 So I don't know whether it's blockchain or something.

48:39.580 --> 48:40.420
 Speak for yourself.

48:40.420 --> 48:41.580
 I want this public.

48:41.580 --> 48:43.540
 The live stream.

48:43.540 --> 48:45.660
 I guess it depends on how you go.

48:45.660 --> 48:48.980
 But there's a lot of stuff you don't want out there.

48:48.980 --> 48:51.620
 And this definitely has to be number one

48:51.620 --> 48:54.500
 because it's one thing to have your credit card

48:54.500 --> 48:55.860
 information stolen, it's another thing

48:55.860 --> 48:57.740
 your health records are permanently out there.

48:57.740 --> 48:58.580
 Yeah.

48:58.580 --> 48:59.860
 So there's, on the biology side,

48:59.860 --> 49:03.620
 super exciting ways to slow aging.

49:03.620 --> 49:05.580
 But there's also on the lifestyle side.

49:05.580 --> 49:08.060
 I recently did a 72 hour fast.

49:08.060 --> 49:09.420
 It's just an opportunity to take a pause

49:09.420 --> 49:11.700
 and appreciate life.

49:12.540 --> 49:14.380
 Think about, there's something about fasting

49:14.380 --> 49:19.300
 that encourages you to reflect deeper

49:19.300 --> 49:21.060
 than you otherwise might.

49:22.060 --> 49:24.060
 The time kind of slows.

49:24.060 --> 49:25.980
 And you also realize that you're human

49:25.980 --> 49:27.340
 because your body needs food.

49:27.340 --> 49:30.580
 And you start to see your body's almost as a machine

49:30.580 --> 49:33.660
 that takes food and produces thoughts.

49:33.660 --> 49:36.860
 And then ends briefly.

49:36.860 --> 49:39.940
 I mean, you start to, depending who you are,

49:39.940 --> 49:41.700
 if you're like engineering minded,

49:41.700 --> 49:43.580
 you start to think of this whole thing

49:43.580 --> 49:46.100
 as a kind of, yeah, as a machine.

49:46.100 --> 49:50.860
 And then also feelings fill this machine.

49:50.860 --> 49:52.460
 Feelings of gratitude, of love,

49:52.460 --> 49:56.580
 but also the uglier things of jealousy

49:56.580 --> 49:59.660
 and greed and hate and all those kinds of things.

49:59.660 --> 50:04.540
 You start to think, okay, how do I manage this body

50:04.540 --> 50:06.140
 to create a rich experience?

50:06.140 --> 50:07.740
 All of that comes from fasting for me.

50:07.740 --> 50:11.740
 Anyway, but there's also health benefits to fasting.

50:11.740 --> 50:13.340
 I intermittent fast a lot.

50:13.340 --> 50:16.580
 I eat just one meal a day most of the time.

50:16.580 --> 50:18.180
 Is there something you could say

50:18.180 --> 50:20.460
 about the benefits of fasting in your own life

50:20.460 --> 50:23.460
 and in general the anti aging process?

50:23.460 --> 50:25.540
 Well, you're a philosopher too.

50:25.540 --> 50:26.860
 Sorry, I apologize.

50:26.860 --> 50:28.420
 No, I'm impressed.

50:28.420 --> 50:30.340
 True Renaissance man.

50:30.340 --> 50:31.900
 It's a joy to be here.

50:31.900 --> 50:34.060
 So when it comes to fasting, this is,

50:34.060 --> 50:37.140
 being abstemious is one of the oldest ways

50:37.140 --> 50:38.420
 to improve health.

50:38.420 --> 50:41.540
 Probably they knew this 5,000 plus years ago.

50:41.540 --> 50:43.100
 So that's not new.

50:43.100 --> 50:45.580
 But what we're figuring out is what is optimal

50:45.580 --> 50:47.020
 and how does it work?

50:47.020 --> 50:49.500
 And one of the things we help contribute to,

50:49.500 --> 50:51.780
 which I can speak to with some authority

50:51.780 --> 50:54.380
 is that these longevity genes we work on,

50:54.380 --> 50:56.340
 we showed back in the early 2000s

50:56.340 --> 50:58.580
 are turned on by fasting.

50:58.580 --> 51:01.140
 And at least in yeast, we were the first to show

51:01.140 --> 51:03.260
 that how calorie restriction fasting works

51:03.260 --> 51:04.460
 to extend lifespan.

51:04.460 --> 51:06.420
 And that was the first for any species.

51:06.420 --> 51:08.180
 Something similar happens in our bodies.

51:08.180 --> 51:10.500
 When we're hungry or put our bodies

51:10.500 --> 51:12.620
 under any other perceived adversity,

51:12.620 --> 51:14.660
 such as running, our bodies think,

51:14.660 --> 51:18.420
 wow, we're getting chased by a saber tooth cat or something.

51:19.500 --> 51:22.420
 If we're really hot or cold, these probably also work.

51:22.420 --> 51:24.740
 To put our bodies in this defensive state,

51:24.740 --> 51:27.140
 to activate these genes in the way that whales do

51:27.140 --> 51:28.580
 and mice don't.

51:28.580 --> 51:31.300
 And so hunger is the best way to do that.

51:31.300 --> 51:33.700
 In fact, I don't think you have to feel hungry.

51:33.700 --> 51:35.300
 You can get used to it.

51:35.300 --> 51:37.180
 But if there was one thing I would recommend

51:37.180 --> 51:39.500
 to anybody to slow down aging

51:39.500 --> 51:42.820
 would be to skip a meal or two a day.

51:42.820 --> 51:44.420
 Now it doesn't mean you don't have to live well.

51:44.420 --> 51:45.260
 You can go out.

51:45.260 --> 51:47.660
 I go to restaurants, I eat regular food.

51:47.660 --> 51:49.980
 I try to be as healthy as possible.

51:49.980 --> 51:53.340
 But I've gone from skipping breakfast most of my life

51:53.340 --> 51:55.420
 now just skipping lunch as well.

51:55.420 --> 51:59.260
 And I have my physique back that I had when I was 20.

51:59.260 --> 52:01.220
 I feel 20 mentally.

52:01.220 --> 52:02.460
 I'm much sharper.

52:02.460 --> 52:03.460
 I don't feel tired anymore.

52:03.460 --> 52:04.620
 I sleep well.

52:04.620 --> 52:07.340
 So I'm a huge fan of the one meal a day thing.

52:07.340 --> 52:11.100
 Where I'm not good at is going beyond one day.

52:11.100 --> 52:11.940
 But if you do three days.

52:11.940 --> 52:15.580
 Have you ever fasted longer than 24 hours?

52:15.580 --> 52:17.100
 I tried doing two days.

52:17.100 --> 52:20.140
 I might have made it to the third and given up.

52:20.140 --> 52:22.780
 I just find that I'm not very,

52:22.780 --> 52:23.820
 I don't have a lot of willpower.

52:23.820 --> 52:24.900
 I also hate exercise.

52:24.900 --> 52:27.940
 So I'm not sure how long I'm gonna live.

52:27.940 --> 52:29.140
 But I've managed to do one meal a day.

52:29.140 --> 52:31.980
 So if I can do that, seriously, anybody can do that.

52:33.060 --> 52:35.980
 To your listeners and viewers, I would say,

52:35.980 --> 52:38.100
 don't try to do it all at once.

52:38.100 --> 52:40.700
 You can't go from snacking and eating three meals a day

52:40.700 --> 52:42.820
 to what I do easily.

52:42.820 --> 52:45.580
 Work your way up to it, but also compensate with drinking.

52:45.580 --> 52:48.860
 If you like tea, if you like coffee, put some milk in it.

52:48.860 --> 52:49.700
 That's fine.

52:49.700 --> 52:52.340
 You can fill your stomach up with liquids,

52:52.340 --> 52:54.180
 diet sodas, I get criticized for drinking,

52:54.180 --> 52:56.540
 but I'm gonna continue to have those.

52:56.540 --> 52:58.260
 But then I power through the day.

52:58.260 --> 52:59.740
 I definitely don't feel tired.

52:59.740 --> 53:00.860
 I don't have a lag anymore.

53:00.860 --> 53:02.660
 But also give it at least two weeks

53:02.660 --> 53:04.900
 because there's a habit as well.

53:04.900 --> 53:06.540
 Having something in your mouth, chewing,

53:06.540 --> 53:09.500
 feeling that fullness, you can break that habit.

53:09.500 --> 53:12.060
 And within two, three weeks, you'll have done it.

53:12.060 --> 53:12.900
 Absolutely.

53:12.900 --> 53:14.500
 So I'm not actually even that strict about it.

53:14.500 --> 53:15.940
 You said diet soda.

53:15.940 --> 53:18.500
 Yeah, people are very kind of weirdly strict

53:18.500 --> 53:20.860
 about fasting, the rules in fasting.

53:20.860 --> 53:25.620
 Like for example, I drank Element electrolytes

53:25.620 --> 53:28.380
 when I was fasting, and that has like five calories.

53:28.380 --> 53:31.220
 And so technically it's not fasting.

53:31.220 --> 53:33.700
 Or people will say like, if you drink coffee,

53:33.700 --> 53:35.440
 there's caffeine, and they'll say

53:35.440 --> 53:36.940
 that's technically not fasting

53:36.940 --> 53:38.700
 because there's some kind of biological effects

53:38.700 --> 53:40.300
 of caffeine, but whatever.

53:40.300 --> 53:42.420
 Of course, there's like biological benefits

53:42.420 --> 53:43.540
 that you can argue about,

53:43.540 --> 53:45.980
 but there's also just experiential benefits.

53:45.980 --> 53:49.980
 Just calorie restriction broadly has a certain experience

53:49.980 --> 53:52.420
 to it that, like for me personally,

53:52.420 --> 53:55.180
 just as you said, has made me feel really good.

53:55.180 --> 54:00.020
 That said, especially, I've gained quite a bit of weight,

54:01.380 --> 54:03.340
 maybe even like 15 pounds, something like that,

54:03.340 --> 54:05.660
 since I moved to Austin, Texas.

54:05.660 --> 54:08.500
 And I still keep the same diet,

54:08.500 --> 54:12.840
 but I eat a lot of meat in that one,

54:12.840 --> 54:14.060
 just because it's delicious,

54:14.060 --> 54:19.060
 because it's also the amazing people I met in Texas.

54:19.060 --> 54:21.700
 It's just there's like a camaraderie,

54:21.700 --> 54:23.420
 a friendship, a love to the people

54:23.420 --> 54:25.660
 that like makes you really enjoy

54:25.660 --> 54:29.300
 the atmosphere of eating the brisket and the meat.

54:29.300 --> 54:31.060
 Is this Joe Rogan insisting?

54:31.060 --> 54:33.620
 Joe is, I mean, he's very different.

54:34.660 --> 54:38.660
 Joe loves bread and pasta.

54:38.660 --> 54:42.180
 Like he knows that his body feels best

54:42.180 --> 54:44.220
 doing keto or carnivore.

54:44.220 --> 54:47.420
 So that's what he usually tries to stick to,

54:47.420 --> 54:50.100
 but he also does not hold back,

54:50.100 --> 54:52.660
 and he'll just eat pasta when he eats pasta,

54:52.660 --> 54:55.100
 and he sort of enjoys life in that way.

54:55.100 --> 54:57.820
 I can't, I don't know how to enjoy life in that way.

54:57.820 --> 55:01.780
 I also love pasta, but I'm just not going to enjoy it,

55:01.780 --> 55:05.740
 because I know my body ultimately

55:05.740 --> 55:06.980
 does not feel good with pasta.

55:06.980 --> 55:09.340
 So it's a funny kind of dichotomies.

55:09.340 --> 55:13.740
 I would like to cheat, I guess,

55:13.740 --> 55:18.580
 by eating more meat than I, you know, like overeating

55:19.620 --> 55:22.300
 on the things that I know my body feels good on

55:22.300 --> 55:24.260
 as opposed to eating stuff I shouldn't,

55:24.260 --> 55:26.380
 like cake and all those kinds of things.

55:26.380 --> 55:31.380
 I tend to find happiness in overeating the good stuff

55:32.460 --> 55:35.940
 versus eating the bad stuff.

55:35.940 --> 55:37.660
 And that's the kind of balance.

55:37.660 --> 55:40.100
 Him, he's like, fuck it.

55:41.060 --> 55:43.380
 Every once in a while, you gotta enjoy it.

55:43.380 --> 55:46.180
 And then also coupled with that for him

55:47.060 --> 55:51.100
 is just exercise, like then face his demons the next day

55:51.100 --> 55:53.540
 and just like burn a huge amount of calories,

55:53.540 --> 55:58.540
 which is, I mean, whatever's up with that guy's mind,

55:58.860 --> 56:03.780
 there's an, there's a ability to fully experience life,

56:03.780 --> 56:05.980
 which is represented by the pasta,

56:05.980 --> 56:09.180
 and the ability to just like fight the demons,

56:09.180 --> 56:11.380
 which is represented by all the crazy kettle balls

56:11.380 --> 56:13.900
 and running the hills and all this kind of stuff

56:13.900 --> 56:14.740
 that he does.

56:14.740 --> 56:16.260
 That takes a lot out of you doing

56:16.260 --> 56:17.540
 that kind of insane exercise.

56:17.540 --> 56:20.420
 And I think I'm more like you,

56:20.420 --> 56:22.500
 or at least towards your direction is like,

56:22.500 --> 56:24.420
 I really hate exercise.

56:24.420 --> 56:26.820
 So I do it, but I really hate it.

56:26.820 --> 56:29.620
 And so it's a balance that you have to strike.

56:29.620 --> 56:33.460
 Is there something you could say about the diet side of that

56:33.460 --> 56:35.980
 for you personally, but in general,

56:36.980 --> 56:39.780
 in order to achieve calorie restriction,

56:39.780 --> 56:43.940
 like for me, eating, I know it may not sound healthy,

56:43.940 --> 56:47.820
 but eating carnivore, eating mostly meat

56:47.820 --> 56:50.060
 has been, has made me feel really good,

56:50.060 --> 56:52.820
 both mentally and physically.

56:52.820 --> 56:56.220
 Is there something you could say about the kinds of diets

56:56.220 --> 56:57.740
 that may improve longevity,

56:57.740 --> 57:01.140
 but also enable calorie restriction?

57:01.140 --> 57:01.980
 Well, sure.

57:02.820 --> 57:04.540
 I mean, the first thing that's important to know

57:04.540 --> 57:08.700
 is that while many people are interested slash obsessed

57:08.700 --> 57:11.220
 with what they eat,

57:11.220 --> 57:13.620
 the data that's come out of animal studies at least

57:13.620 --> 57:17.300
 is it's far more important when you eat than what you eat.

57:17.300 --> 57:20.140
 And this was a fantastic study a few years ago

57:20.140 --> 57:22.020
 by my friend, Rafael de Cabo

57:22.020 --> 57:24.700
 at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda.

57:24.700 --> 57:26.900
 And he had 10,000 mice on different diets,

57:26.900 --> 57:30.980
 hoping to find the perfect mix of carbs, protein, and fat.

57:30.980 --> 57:33.260
 And it turns out that the only ones that lived longer

57:33.260 --> 57:35.860
 are the ones that only ate once a day.

57:35.860 --> 57:37.940
 And so that, if we're not mice,

57:37.940 --> 57:40.300
 but I think that we're close enough to mice

57:40.300 --> 57:42.620
 that this tells us a lot.

57:42.620 --> 57:44.900
 But okay, but I still think the best bang

57:44.900 --> 57:47.820
 for the longevity buck is to do both well,

57:47.820 --> 57:51.580
 eat less often and eat the right things.

57:51.580 --> 57:54.340
 Now I'll preface this to say, I'm not a nut about this.

57:54.340 --> 57:57.940
 I will eat occasional, very occasionally a dessert.

57:57.940 --> 58:00.860
 Usually I steal from others, which doesn't count, right?

58:00.860 --> 58:01.700
 Exactly.

58:01.700 --> 58:02.660
 But you gotta live life, right?

58:02.660 --> 58:05.460
 What's a long life if it's not enjoyable anyway?

58:05.460 --> 58:08.100
 But what I also found, and this is,

58:08.100 --> 58:09.220
 I'll get to your question in a second,

58:09.220 --> 58:12.540
 but my microbiome right now and stomach is at a point

58:12.540 --> 58:15.700
 where if I try to overeat on a steak,

58:15.700 --> 58:16.900
 which I did a couple of days ago,

58:16.900 --> 58:21.900
 I actually had a chicken, a fried chicken specifically,

58:22.260 --> 58:23.860
 for two days, I felt terrible.

58:23.860 --> 58:26.020
 I couldn't sleep, it wouldn't go down.

58:26.020 --> 58:28.260
 So I'm now at a point where even if I want to binge

58:28.260 --> 58:31.620
 on meat and fried foods, I just can't, it just feels bad.

58:32.780 --> 58:34.260
 But what do I recommend?

58:34.260 --> 58:37.020
 Well, what the data says, which I try to follow,

58:37.020 --> 58:40.340
 is that plant based foods will be better

58:40.340 --> 58:41.300
 than meat based foods.

58:41.300 --> 58:43.900
 And I know that there are a lot of people who disagree.

58:43.900 --> 58:46.220
 But one of the facts is, well, there's a few facts.

58:46.220 --> 58:47.620
 One is that people who live a long time

58:47.620 --> 58:48.780
 tend to eat those type of diets.

58:48.780 --> 58:51.020
 Mediterranean, Okinawa diet,

58:51.020 --> 58:53.940
 they're eating mostly plants with a little bit of meat

58:53.940 --> 58:55.940
 and not a lot of red meat.

58:55.940 --> 58:58.580
 And the other fact is that in animals we know

58:58.580 --> 59:01.340
 that there's a mechanism that's called mTOR,

59:01.340 --> 59:05.420
 little m, capital TOR, that responds to certain amino acids

59:05.420 --> 59:07.620
 that are found in more abundance in meat.

59:07.620 --> 59:10.260
 And when it responds, it actually shortens lifespan.

59:10.260 --> 59:11.540
 And the converse, if you starve it

59:11.540 --> 59:15.820
 of those three amino acids, mostly in meat,

59:15.820 --> 59:17.540
 then it extends lifespan.

59:17.540 --> 59:19.460
 And there's a drug called rapamycin,

59:19.460 --> 59:22.740
 which some people are experimenting with, that does that.

59:22.740 --> 59:25.540
 So you might be able to, I'm just saying this here

59:25.540 --> 59:27.660
 from all my colleagues, we don't know the results here,

59:27.660 --> 59:30.660
 but you could potentially take a rapamycin like drug

59:30.660 --> 59:34.260
 and counteract the effects of meat in the long run.

59:34.260 --> 59:35.820
 Dono, we should try that actually,

59:35.820 --> 59:37.300
 we could do that in the lab.

59:37.300 --> 59:39.340
 But getting to the bottom of this,

59:39.340 --> 59:41.220
 what I think is going on is that

59:41.220 --> 59:42.900
 just like testosterone and growth hormone,

59:42.900 --> 59:47.100
 you will get temporary, maybe not temporary,

59:47.100 --> 59:48.580
 immediate health benefits.

59:48.580 --> 59:51.900
 You'll feel great, you'll get more muscle energy.

59:51.900 --> 59:54.300
 But the problem is I think it's at the expense

59:54.300 --> 59:56.140
 of longterm health and longevity.

59:56.140 --> 1:00:00.460
 Well, this is actually something I worry about

1:00:00.460 --> 1:00:05.020
 in terms of longterm effects or the cost

1:00:05.020 --> 1:00:05.900
 in terms of longevity.

1:00:05.900 --> 1:00:08.060
 It's very difficult to know how your choices

1:00:08.060 --> 1:00:12.780
 affect your longevity because the impact is down the line.

1:00:12.780 --> 1:00:17.780
 Like just because something makes me feel good now,

1:00:17.780 --> 1:00:20.420
 like eating only meat makes me feel good now,

1:00:20.420 --> 1:00:22.420
 I wonder what are the costs down the line.

1:00:22.420 --> 1:00:24.940
 Well, think about what I was saying about the trade offs

1:00:24.940 --> 1:00:27.220
 between growth and reproduction,

1:00:27.220 --> 1:00:29.300
 which is what a mouse does and a whale

1:00:29.300 --> 1:00:33.060
 that grows slowly, reproduces slowly, lives a long time.

1:00:33.060 --> 1:00:35.060
 It's called the disposable soma theory.

1:00:35.900 --> 1:00:38.780
 Koch would just propose that in the 70s.

1:00:38.780 --> 1:00:42.140
 What meat probably does is put you in the mouse category,

1:00:42.140 --> 1:00:44.780
 super fertile, grow fast, heal fast.

1:00:44.780 --> 1:00:46.660
 And then if you wanna be a whale,

1:00:46.660 --> 1:00:49.660
 you should restrict meat and do things

1:00:49.660 --> 1:00:53.380
 that promote the preservation of your body.

1:00:53.380 --> 1:00:57.820
 Is it difficult to eat a plant based diet

1:00:57.820 --> 1:01:00.020
 that you perform well under?

1:01:00.020 --> 1:01:02.860
 So mentally and physically, just almost,

1:01:02.860 --> 1:01:06.860
 I'm asking almost like an anecdotal question

1:01:06.860 --> 1:01:08.380
 or unless you know the science.

1:01:09.780 --> 1:01:12.140
 Well, the science is still being worked out,

1:01:12.140 --> 1:01:15.180
 but from the synthesis of everything that I've read,

1:01:15.180 --> 1:01:20.140
 I try to eat a diet that's definitely full of leafy greens,

1:01:21.180 --> 1:01:22.580
 particularly spinach is great

1:01:22.580 --> 1:01:25.860
 because it's got the iron that we need, plenty of vitamins.

1:01:25.860 --> 1:01:30.860
 I also try to avoid too much fruit and berries,

1:01:32.420 --> 1:01:34.020
 particularly fruit juice,

1:01:34.020 --> 1:01:35.900
 definitely avoid that sugar high.

1:01:35.900 --> 1:01:39.900
 Spiking your sugar is not healthy in the long run.

1:01:39.900 --> 1:01:40.940
 The other thing that's interesting

1:01:40.940 --> 1:01:45.500
 is we discovered what we called xenohormetic molecules.

1:01:45.500 --> 1:01:47.580
 Let me unpack that because it's a terrible name

1:01:47.580 --> 1:01:49.460
 and I take full responsibility

1:01:49.460 --> 1:01:51.740
 with my friend, Conrad Howards.

1:01:51.740 --> 1:01:53.900
 The Xeno means cross species

1:01:53.900 --> 1:01:57.380
 and hormesis is the term that what doesn't kill you

1:01:57.380 --> 1:02:01.180
 makes you live longer and be healthier.

1:02:01.180 --> 1:02:04.620
 And so we're getting cross species health improvements

1:02:04.620 --> 1:02:06.940
 by molecules that plants make.

1:02:06.940 --> 1:02:08.220
 And plants make these molecules

1:02:08.220 --> 1:02:11.780
 when they're also under adversity or perceived adversity.

1:02:11.780 --> 1:02:14.140
 For instance, I understand

1:02:14.140 --> 1:02:16.700
 if you want really healthy, good oranges,

1:02:16.700 --> 1:02:19.340
 you can drive nails into the bark of the tree

1:02:19.340 --> 1:02:20.380
 before you harvest.

1:02:20.380 --> 1:02:23.220
 Same with wine, you typically want them to be dry

1:02:23.220 --> 1:02:25.940
 before you harvest or covered in fungus.

1:02:25.940 --> 1:02:28.820
 And that's because these plants make these colorful

1:02:28.820 --> 1:02:30.700
 and xenohormetic molecules

1:02:30.700 --> 1:02:33.380
 that make themselves stress resistant,

1:02:33.380 --> 1:02:37.700
 turn on their sirtuin defenses, the serogenes remember.

1:02:37.700 --> 1:02:40.300
 And when we eat them, we get those same benefits.

1:02:40.300 --> 1:02:42.220
 That's the idea and we've evolved to do so.

1:02:42.220 --> 1:02:43.700
 This isn't a coincidence.

1:02:43.700 --> 1:02:47.020
 It's my theory, our theory that we want to know

1:02:47.020 --> 1:02:49.220
 when our food supply is under adversity

1:02:49.220 --> 1:02:51.980
 because we need to get ready for a famine.

1:02:51.980 --> 1:02:54.580
 And so we hunker down and preserve our body

1:02:54.580 --> 1:02:55.860
 and by eating these colored foods,

1:02:55.860 --> 1:02:58.780
 so practically speaking, if it's full of color

1:02:58.780 --> 1:03:01.900
 or if there's been some chewing by a caterpillar,

1:03:01.900 --> 1:03:04.980
 organic, grown locally in local farms,

1:03:04.980 --> 1:03:09.980
 I'll eat that versus a watery, insipid, light colored lettuce

1:03:11.180 --> 1:03:12.780
 that's been grown in California.

1:03:12.780 --> 1:03:14.540
 So you want vegetables that have suffered.

1:03:14.540 --> 1:03:16.700
 You want the David Goggins as a vegetables.

1:03:16.700 --> 1:03:19.300
 That's the xenohormetic molecules.

1:03:19.300 --> 1:03:20.780
 I love that term.

1:03:20.780 --> 1:03:23.300
 I'm gonna take that one with me, thank you.

1:03:23.300 --> 1:03:24.140
 Yeah.

1:03:24.980 --> 1:03:27.380
 Oh, I follow him on Instagram, he's always screaming.

1:03:27.380 --> 1:03:29.900
 So you want that he's basically

1:03:30.940 --> 1:03:34.860
 the xenohormetic version of a human.

1:03:36.060 --> 1:03:36.900
 I like it.

1:03:36.900 --> 1:03:38.980
 So these are the molecules that are representative

1:03:38.980 --> 1:03:43.980
 of the stress that a plant has been under.

1:03:43.980 --> 1:03:46.660
 Yeah, the best example of that is resveratrol,

1:03:46.660 --> 1:03:48.140
 which many people, including myself,

1:03:48.140 --> 1:03:49.660
 take as a supplement.

1:03:49.660 --> 1:03:52.660
 Grapes, grapevines produce that in abundance

1:03:52.660 --> 1:03:55.780
 when they're dried out or they have too much light

1:03:55.780 --> 1:03:59.060
 or fungus and that we've shown activates

1:03:59.060 --> 1:04:01.500
 the Sertu enzyme in our bodies,

1:04:01.500 --> 1:04:03.780
 which remember is what extends lifespan in yeast

1:04:03.780 --> 1:04:05.780
 and slows down aging in the brain.

1:04:05.780 --> 1:04:06.900
 That's beautiful.

1:04:06.900 --> 1:04:09.260
 Yeah, I tend to avoid fruit as well.

1:04:09.260 --> 1:04:12.660
 So green, veggies, anything that's not very sweet.

1:04:12.660 --> 1:04:15.420
 So I would just say you're relatively low,

1:04:15.420 --> 1:04:19.140
 like you try to avoid sugary things as well.

1:04:19.140 --> 1:04:21.500
 Yeah, I'm fairly militant about that.

1:04:21.500 --> 1:04:23.900
 I rarely would add sugar to anything.

1:04:23.900 --> 1:04:27.820
 Occasionally I would eat a slice of cheesecake,

1:04:27.820 --> 1:04:31.060
 but that would be maybe once or twice a year.

1:04:31.060 --> 1:04:32.900
 You have to give in occasionally.

1:04:32.900 --> 1:04:34.780
 But yeah, anything that's sweet,

1:04:34.780 --> 1:04:37.460
 I would rather substitute something like Stevia

1:04:37.460 --> 1:04:38.620
 if I need a sugar hit.

1:04:40.820 --> 1:04:42.420
 What about exercise?

1:04:42.420 --> 1:04:43.620
 Your favorite topic.

1:04:45.260 --> 1:04:46.660
 Is there a part?

1:04:46.660 --> 1:04:48.500
 I don't mind talking about it.

1:04:48.500 --> 1:04:49.340
 Okay, great.

1:04:49.340 --> 1:04:53.460
 Is there benefits to longevity from exercise?

1:04:53.460 --> 1:04:55.940
 Well, no doubt, that's proven.

1:04:55.940 --> 1:04:59.180
 Just like fasting, it's pretty clear that that works.

1:04:59.180 --> 1:05:01.860
 For example, there are studies of cyclists.

1:05:01.860 --> 1:05:04.180
 It was something like people that cycle

1:05:04.180 --> 1:05:07.660
 over 80 miles a week have a 40% reduction

1:05:07.660 --> 1:05:10.380
 in a variety of diseases, certainly heart disease.

1:05:10.380 --> 1:05:11.580
 So that's not even a question,

1:05:11.580 --> 1:05:13.460
 but what's interesting is that we're learning

1:05:13.460 --> 1:05:15.620
 that you don't need much to have a big benefit.

1:05:15.620 --> 1:05:17.420
 It's an asymptotic curve.

1:05:17.420 --> 1:05:19.140
 And in fact, if you overdo it,

1:05:19.140 --> 1:05:20.620
 you probably have reduced benefits,

1:05:20.620 --> 1:05:22.140
 particularly if you start to wear out joints,

1:05:22.140 --> 1:05:23.460
 that kind of thing.

1:05:23.460 --> 1:05:26.300
 But just 10 minutes on a treadmill a few times a week,

1:05:26.300 --> 1:05:28.540
 lose your breath, get hypoxic, as it's called,

1:05:28.540 --> 1:05:32.620
 seems to be very beneficial for longterm health.

1:05:32.620 --> 1:05:36.420
 And that's the kind of exercise that I like to do, aerobic.

1:05:36.420 --> 1:05:38.460
 Though I do enjoy lifting weights,

1:05:38.460 --> 1:05:40.860
 so that is what I call my exercise,

1:05:40.860 --> 1:05:41.820
 which has other benefits,

1:05:41.820 --> 1:05:46.180
 including maintaining hormone levels, male hormone levels.

1:05:46.180 --> 1:05:49.860
 But also really why I do it is I want to be able

1:05:49.860 --> 1:05:53.460
 to counteract the effects of sitting for most of the day.

1:05:53.460 --> 1:05:55.740
 And as you get older, you lose muscle mass.

1:05:55.740 --> 1:05:57.620
 It's a percent or so a year.

1:05:57.620 --> 1:05:59.420
 And I don't wanna be frail when I'm older

1:05:59.420 --> 1:06:00.820
 and fall over and break my hip,

1:06:00.820 --> 1:06:04.100
 which happens every 20 seconds in this country.

1:06:04.100 --> 1:06:05.460
 So maintaining that strength,

1:06:05.460 --> 1:06:07.900
 but also doing the cardio for the longevity,

1:06:07.900 --> 1:06:10.100
 for avoiding the heart disease.

1:06:10.100 --> 1:06:13.020
 Yeah, I definitely, just like with fasting,

1:06:13.020 --> 1:06:15.580
 have the philosophical benefit of running long

1:06:15.580 --> 1:06:17.060
 and running slow.

1:06:17.060 --> 1:06:19.300
 I enjoy it, because it kind of clears the mind

1:06:19.300 --> 1:06:20.540
 and allows you to think,

1:06:20.540 --> 1:06:22.980
 and actually listen to brown noise as I run.

1:06:22.980 --> 1:06:26.340
 It really helps remove myself from the world

1:06:26.340 --> 1:06:28.700
 and just like zoom in on particular thoughts.

1:06:28.700 --> 1:06:29.980
 What are these brown noise?

1:06:29.980 --> 1:06:31.860
 It's like white noise, but deeper.

1:06:31.860 --> 1:06:35.060
 So like the white noise is like shh,

1:06:35.060 --> 1:06:37.140
 and then brown noise is more like,

1:06:37.140 --> 1:06:39.900
 shh, like ocean.

1:06:39.900 --> 1:06:40.780
 That sounds great.

1:06:40.780 --> 1:06:41.700
 I might try that.

1:06:41.700 --> 1:06:44.900
 Yeah, yeah, it's more soothing probably.

1:06:44.900 --> 1:06:45.740
 I'm not sure.

1:06:45.740 --> 1:06:46.580
 There could be science to this.

1:06:46.580 --> 1:06:47.580
 I need to look this up.

1:06:47.580 --> 1:06:48.820
 I've been meaning to.

1:06:48.820 --> 1:06:50.460
 But when I started,

1:06:52.100 --> 1:06:53.780
 this is maybe like five years ago,

1:06:53.780 --> 1:06:56.020
 I started listening to brown noise when I work.

1:06:56.020 --> 1:06:58.340
 And the first time I listened to it,

1:06:58.340 --> 1:07:00.220
 something happened to my mind

1:07:00.220 --> 1:07:03.660
 where it just went like zoomed in

1:07:03.660 --> 1:07:07.780
 to like, in a way that it felt like really weird.

1:07:07.780 --> 1:07:11.540
 Like how precisely it was able to sort of

1:07:11.540 --> 1:07:14.500
 remove the distractions of the world

1:07:14.500 --> 1:07:16.460
 and really help my mind.

1:07:16.460 --> 1:07:19.540
 Obviously, like the mind is trying to focus

1:07:19.540 --> 1:07:21.700
 and then it just enabled that process

1:07:21.700 --> 1:07:24.420
 of trying to focus on a particular problem.

1:07:24.420 --> 1:07:26.220
 I don't know if this is generalizable to others.

1:07:26.220 --> 1:07:27.300
 People should definitely try it

1:07:27.300 --> 1:07:28.980
 if you're listening to this.

1:07:28.980 --> 1:07:30.180
 Maybe it's just my own mind,

1:07:30.180 --> 1:07:34.420
 but it's funny, like it made me,

1:07:34.420 --> 1:07:35.780
 brown noise made me realize

1:07:35.780 --> 1:07:38.620
 that there's probably hacks out there

1:07:38.620 --> 1:07:40.140
 that work for me

1:07:40.140 --> 1:07:41.780
 that I should be constantly looking for.

1:07:41.780 --> 1:07:44.620
 It's almost like an encouraging

1:07:44.620 --> 1:07:48.300
 and motivating event

1:07:48.300 --> 1:07:49.900
 that maybe there's other stuff out there.

1:07:49.900 --> 1:07:52.780
 Maybe there's other brown noise like things out there

1:07:52.780 --> 1:07:56.020
 that truly like almost immediately make me feel better.

1:07:56.020 --> 1:07:57.780
 I don't know if it's generalizable to others,

1:07:57.780 --> 1:08:00.500
 but it does seem that it's the case

1:08:00.500 --> 1:08:03.180
 that there's probably for many others,

1:08:03.180 --> 1:08:05.820
 things like that that could be discovered.

1:08:05.820 --> 1:08:07.980
 And so it's always disappointing

1:08:07.980 --> 1:08:10.260
 when I find things in life

1:08:10.260 --> 1:08:12.860
 that I wish I would have found earlier.

1:08:12.860 --> 1:08:17.260
 I got LASIK eye surgery a few years ago

1:08:17.260 --> 1:08:19.340
 and the first thought I had like the next day

1:08:19.340 --> 1:08:21.260
 when I woke up is like,

1:08:21.260 --> 1:08:24.100
 damn it, why didn't I do this way earlier?

1:08:24.100 --> 1:08:27.220
 There's all this stuff of that nature

1:08:27.220 --> 1:08:29.540
 that are yet to be discovered.

1:08:29.540 --> 1:08:31.620
 So it pays to explore.

1:08:31.620 --> 1:08:34.420
 You have a different mind, you have quite a beautiful mind.

1:08:34.420 --> 1:08:37.100
 So I suspect brown noise helps you focus

1:08:37.100 --> 1:08:39.060
 and cause you're probably all over the place

1:08:39.060 --> 1:08:40.140
 if you don't control it.

1:08:40.140 --> 1:08:40.980
 Yeah, exactly.

1:08:40.980 --> 1:08:42.260
 It means something about it.

1:08:42.260 --> 1:08:43.340
 It's a programmer thing.

1:08:43.340 --> 1:08:48.340
 I don't, programming is a really difficult mental journey

1:08:50.140 --> 1:08:52.820
 cause you have to keep a lot of things in mind.

1:08:52.820 --> 1:08:56.460
 You have to, so you're constantly designing things

1:08:56.460 --> 1:08:58.060
 then you have to be extremely precise

1:08:58.060 --> 1:09:01.060
 by making those things concrete in code.

1:09:01.060 --> 1:09:05.140
 You also have to look stuff up on the internet

1:09:06.140 --> 1:09:08.660
 to sort of feed like information

1:09:08.660 --> 1:09:10.420
 and looking up stuff on the internet,

1:09:10.420 --> 1:09:12.380
 internet is full of like distracting things.

1:09:12.380 --> 1:09:13.780
 So you have to be really focused

1:09:13.780 --> 1:09:16.780
 in the way you look stuff up in pulling that information in.

1:09:16.780 --> 1:09:20.100
 So it requires a certain discipline and a certain focus

1:09:20.100 --> 1:09:23.980
 that I've been very much exploring how to do.

1:09:23.980 --> 1:09:26.340
 Like I do it really well in the morning,

1:09:26.340 --> 1:09:28.300
 coffee is involved, all those kinds of things.

1:09:28.300 --> 1:09:32.620
 You're trying to optimize, keeping very positive inspired,

1:09:32.620 --> 1:09:34.580
 no social media, all those kinds of things

1:09:34.580 --> 1:09:36.140
 and trying to optimize for.

1:09:36.140 --> 1:09:38.660
 And everybody has their own kind of little journey

1:09:38.660 --> 1:09:40.540
 that they try to understand.

1:09:40.540 --> 1:09:41.940
 You get this from like writers

1:09:41.940 --> 1:09:45.820
 when you read about the habits of writers,

1:09:45.820 --> 1:09:47.860
 like the habits they do in the morning,

1:09:47.860 --> 1:09:49.820
 they usually write like two, three, four hours a day

1:09:49.820 --> 1:09:50.980
 and that's it.

1:09:50.980 --> 1:09:53.460
 It's like they optimize that ritual.

1:09:53.460 --> 1:09:55.460
 And then there's always Hunter S. Thompson.

1:09:55.460 --> 1:10:00.460
 So sometimes it pays off to be wild.

1:10:01.340 --> 1:10:04.580
 What about sleep?

1:10:04.580 --> 1:10:06.740
 How important is sleep for longevity?

1:10:06.740 --> 1:10:10.740
 I would guess based on the evidence

1:10:10.740 --> 1:10:12.180
 that it's really important

1:10:12.180 --> 1:10:15.060
 and because we don't know for sure.

1:10:15.060 --> 1:10:17.580
 But what we know from animal studies is the following.

1:10:17.580 --> 1:10:20.260
 If you restrict sleep from a rat for just two weeks,

1:10:20.260 --> 1:10:22.180
 it'll develop type two diabetes.

1:10:22.180 --> 1:10:23.380
 It's that important.

1:10:23.380 --> 1:10:25.820
 So that's the main thing.

1:10:25.820 --> 1:10:28.460
 What we also know is at the molecular level

1:10:28.460 --> 1:10:33.340
 that if you disrupt your sleep wake cycle,

1:10:33.340 --> 1:10:35.100
 so we actually have proteins that go up and down

1:10:35.100 --> 1:10:36.700
 that control our sleep wake.

1:10:36.700 --> 1:10:39.220
 All of us, most of our cells do that.

1:10:39.220 --> 1:10:42.460
 If you disrupt that, you'll get premature aging.

1:10:42.460 --> 1:10:43.300
 And guess what?

1:10:43.300 --> 1:10:44.140
 The opposite is true.

1:10:44.140 --> 1:10:46.740
 That as you get older, that cycle,

1:10:46.740 --> 1:10:49.460
 the amplitude becomes diminished.

1:10:49.460 --> 1:10:51.300
 And this is why it's harder to get to sleep

1:10:51.300 --> 1:10:52.140
 as you get older

1:10:52.140 --> 1:10:54.500
 and you've got all sorts of problems.

1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:56.940
 And I think what's going on is this positive feedback loop,

1:10:56.940 --> 1:10:59.420
 which is a disaster in your old age,

1:10:59.420 --> 1:11:02.060
 which is you're aging,

1:11:02.060 --> 1:11:05.780
 you can't at this moment totally prevent that.

1:11:05.780 --> 1:11:06.900
 And then it's disrupting your sleep

1:11:06.900 --> 1:11:08.020
 and you get not enough sleep

1:11:08.020 --> 1:11:10.460
 and then that's gonna accelerate your aging process.

1:11:10.460 --> 1:11:13.700
 And so it's known that the people who are shift workers

1:11:13.700 --> 1:11:17.540
 are most susceptible to certain age related diseases.

1:11:17.540 --> 1:11:19.940
 So your bottom line, you definitely wanna work on that.

1:11:19.940 --> 1:11:21.860
 It's one of the reasons I have this ring on my finger,

1:11:21.860 --> 1:11:23.300
 which helps me optimize my sleep

1:11:23.300 --> 1:11:25.860
 and learn what I do the day before,

1:11:25.860 --> 1:11:28.380
 if it was a bad idea and I'll stop doing that,

1:11:28.380 --> 1:11:29.740
 like eating a fried chicken.

1:11:31.740 --> 1:11:34.860
 I see you're still carrying the burdens of that decision.

1:11:34.860 --> 1:11:37.900
 But yeah, sleep is one of those things

1:11:37.900 --> 1:11:41.580
 that's making me wonder about the variability

1:11:41.580 --> 1:11:43.140
 between humans a little bit

1:11:43.140 --> 1:11:46.100
 and how science is often focused on,

1:11:47.540 --> 1:11:51.500
 like it's not often focused on high performers

1:11:51.500 --> 1:11:52.620
 in a particular way.

1:11:53.620 --> 1:11:55.220
 And it's looking at the aggregate

1:11:55.220 --> 1:11:56.940
 versus the individual cases.

1:11:57.820 --> 1:11:59.340
 For example, like for me,

1:11:59.340 --> 1:12:00.940
 I don't know what the exact hours are,

1:12:00.940 --> 1:12:04.260
 but like power naps are incredible.

1:12:06.540 --> 1:12:11.540
 I tend to look at the metric of stress and happiness and joy

1:12:11.740 --> 1:12:13.100
 and try to optimize those.

1:12:13.100 --> 1:12:16.020
 So decreasing stress, increasing happiness

1:12:16.020 --> 1:12:20.140
 and using sleep as just one of the tools to do that.

1:12:20.140 --> 1:12:23.700
 Because like hitting the five, six, seven, eight,

1:12:23.700 --> 1:12:27.180
 nine hour mark or whatever the correct mark is,

1:12:27.180 --> 1:12:29.980
 I find that to be stress inducing for me

1:12:29.980 --> 1:12:32.300
 versus stress relieving.

1:12:32.300 --> 1:12:34.180
 Like thinking about that,

1:12:34.180 --> 1:12:37.340
 I feel best if I sleep sometimes for eight hours,

1:12:37.340 --> 1:12:39.580
 sometimes for four hours and then power nap.

1:12:39.580 --> 1:12:42.580
 And as long as I have a stupid private,

1:12:42.580 --> 1:12:44.460
 usually smile on my face,

1:12:44.460 --> 1:12:46.180
 that's when I'm doing good,

1:12:46.180 --> 1:12:49.460
 as opposed to getting a perfect amount of sleep

1:12:49.460 --> 1:12:53.300
 according to whatever the latest blog post is.

1:12:53.300 --> 1:12:55.380
 And I also pull all nighters still.

1:12:56.500 --> 1:12:59.340
 I also think there's something about the body,

1:12:59.340 --> 1:13:02.860
 like as long as you do it regularly,

1:13:02.860 --> 1:13:04.420
 it's not as stress inducing.

1:13:04.420 --> 1:13:06.820
 Like you know what it is.

1:13:06.820 --> 1:13:08.980
 The reason I pull all nighters isn't for like,

1:13:08.980 --> 1:13:11.580
 I'm playing Diablo three or something,

1:13:11.580 --> 1:13:13.980
 is because I'm doing something I'm truly passionate about.

1:13:13.980 --> 1:13:15.820
 Well, like I'm also love video games,

1:13:15.820 --> 1:13:18.460
 but I'm doing something I'm truly passionate about.

1:13:18.460 --> 1:13:21.420
 And it's almost like there's the Jocko Willing feeling

1:13:21.420 --> 1:13:25.540
 of when I'm up at 7 a.m. and I haven't slept all night

1:13:25.540 --> 1:13:27.140
 and still I'm working on it.

1:13:27.140 --> 1:13:29.500
 There's a kind of a celebration of the human spirit

1:13:29.500 --> 1:13:31.020
 that I really enjoy it.

1:13:31.020 --> 1:13:33.700
 Like, and that's happiness.

1:13:33.700 --> 1:13:35.940
 And to sort of then,

1:13:35.940 --> 1:13:37.940
 and I usually don't tell that kind of stuff to people

1:13:37.940 --> 1:13:40.820
 because their first statement will be like,

1:13:40.820 --> 1:13:42.580
 you should get more sleep.

1:13:42.580 --> 1:13:46.180
 It's like, no, I'm doing stuff I love.

1:13:46.180 --> 1:13:48.980
 You should get more love in your life, bro.

1:13:48.980 --> 1:13:50.380
 That's right.

1:13:50.380 --> 1:13:52.500
 So, but that said, in aggregate,

1:13:52.500 --> 1:13:55.340
 when you look at the full span of life,

1:13:55.340 --> 1:13:57.980
 is probably you should be getting

1:13:57.980 --> 1:14:00.700
 a consistent amount of sleep.

1:14:00.700 --> 1:14:04.900
 And it seems like it's in that seven, eight hour range.

1:14:04.900 --> 1:14:06.700
 Yeah, but it's similar to food.

1:14:06.700 --> 1:14:09.300
 It's the quality, not the quantity, right?

1:14:09.300 --> 1:14:10.700
 And when you get it.

1:14:10.700 --> 1:14:14.420
 So I look at my data pretty often.

1:14:14.420 --> 1:14:17.140
 And what makes a difference to me is not the amount of hours,

1:14:17.140 --> 1:14:20.380
 but the quality, the depth and the deep sleep

1:14:20.380 --> 1:14:21.900
 is what will do it.

1:14:21.900 --> 1:14:24.820
 So if I have a lot of alcohol before going to sleep

1:14:24.820 --> 1:14:26.340
 and I can see my heart rate being different,

1:14:26.340 --> 1:14:28.380
 but what really kills me is that I don't get a lot

1:14:28.380 --> 1:14:32.420
 of that deep sleep and I wake up barely remembering stuff.

1:14:32.420 --> 1:14:34.380
 So that, like you say, if you're happy and contented

1:14:34.380 --> 1:14:37.100
 and you don't have these cortisol chemicals

1:14:37.100 --> 1:14:38.340
 going through your body,

1:14:38.340 --> 1:14:40.660
 you will more naturally get into that deep state.

1:14:40.660 --> 1:14:42.260
 And even if you just get four hours,

1:14:42.260 --> 1:14:45.380
 way better than eight hours of none of that.

1:14:45.380 --> 1:14:46.860
 Yeah, yeah, that's beautiful.

1:14:46.860 --> 1:14:48.180
 And some of that could be genetic.

1:14:48.180 --> 1:14:51.980
 For me, I just, I fall asleep like this.

1:14:51.980 --> 1:14:54.140
 If you want me to fall asleep right now, I can do it.

1:14:54.140 --> 1:14:57.300
 It's no, I have no problem with it.

1:14:57.300 --> 1:14:59.300
 Combined with coffee, I just had two energy drinks.

1:14:59.300 --> 1:15:01.420
 I can probably sleep.

1:15:01.420 --> 1:15:03.540
 So that, I don't know if that's genetics

1:15:03.540 --> 1:15:07.500
 or it's kind of, I don't know what it is.

1:15:07.500 --> 1:15:09.700
 Or maybe that I don't have kids and I'm single.

1:15:09.700 --> 1:15:11.900
 So I don't have, I'm almost listening

1:15:11.900 --> 1:15:15.340
 to some kind of biological signal versus societal signal

1:15:15.340 --> 1:15:17.060
 on when I'm supposed to go to sleep.

1:15:17.060 --> 1:15:20.660
 So I just go to sleep whenever I feel like going to sleep.

1:15:20.660 --> 1:15:22.460
 Well, that's because you're a self employed.

1:15:22.460 --> 1:15:23.300
 Self employed.

1:15:23.300 --> 1:15:24.620
 Most people don't have that luxury,

1:15:24.620 --> 1:15:26.100
 but we're lucky, the two of us,

1:15:26.100 --> 1:15:27.580
 that we can make our own hours.

1:15:27.580 --> 1:15:28.420
 Yeah.

1:15:28.420 --> 1:15:29.780
 But yeah, it's super important.

1:15:29.780 --> 1:15:32.340
 And those people who have shift work,

1:15:32.340 --> 1:15:35.460
 I mean, they really need to change the way that works

1:15:35.460 --> 1:15:37.780
 because they're literally killing those people.

1:15:38.900 --> 1:15:41.740
 Is there something you could say about the,

1:15:41.740 --> 1:15:46.740
 the mind and stress in terms of effect on longevity?

1:15:48.340 --> 1:15:52.460
 Sort of, I don't know if you think about it this way,

1:15:52.460 --> 1:15:55.060
 but when you talk about the biological machine,

1:15:55.060 --> 1:15:57.780
 it's always these mechanisms that don't,

1:15:57.780 --> 1:16:00.860
 are not necessarily directly connected to the brain

1:16:00.860 --> 1:16:02.620
 or the operation of the brain.

1:16:02.620 --> 1:16:06.300
 Like what's the role about stress and happiness

1:16:06.300 --> 1:16:10.700
 and yeah, the sort of higher cognitive things

1:16:10.700 --> 1:16:13.020
 going on in the brain on longevity.

1:16:14.220 --> 1:16:15.060
 Right.

1:16:15.060 --> 1:16:16.820
 Well, that's a great point that the brain

1:16:16.820 --> 1:16:18.300
 is the center for longevity.

1:16:18.300 --> 1:16:20.260
 Actually, we do know that.

1:16:21.140 --> 1:16:22.780
 For a start, when I'm stressed,

1:16:22.780 --> 1:16:24.620
 I can see mentally stressed,

1:16:24.620 --> 1:16:27.060
 then I can see it in my body.

1:16:27.060 --> 1:16:29.540
 Heart rate, hormones, it's clear.

1:16:29.540 --> 1:16:31.420
 That's no true surprise.

1:16:31.420 --> 1:16:33.940
 So you've got to work on your brain first and foremost.

1:16:33.940 --> 1:16:38.940
 If you are totally freaked out, agitated all the time,

1:16:38.940 --> 1:16:40.300
 you will live shorter.

1:16:40.300 --> 1:16:41.140
 I'm certain of it.

1:16:41.140 --> 1:16:42.540
 You know, I keep fish.

1:16:42.540 --> 1:16:46.460
 I'm a big aquarium guy.

1:16:46.460 --> 1:16:47.300
 And you can see the difference

1:16:47.300 --> 1:16:50.540
 between the fish that's having a good time and dominant

1:16:50.540 --> 1:16:52.180
 and one that gets picked on.

1:16:52.180 --> 1:16:54.300
 It just looks like crap.

1:16:54.300 --> 1:16:55.140
 You don't want to be that,

1:16:55.140 --> 1:16:57.740
 the little fish getting picked on if you can help it.

1:16:57.740 --> 1:17:00.100
 So I used to be extremely stressed as a kid.

1:17:00.100 --> 1:17:02.540
 I was a perfectionist, very shy,

1:17:02.540 --> 1:17:05.380
 always worried about being a failure.

1:17:05.380 --> 1:17:06.660
 If I didn't get an A+, you know,

1:17:06.660 --> 1:17:10.500
 I was crying in my bedroom, that kind of sad existence.

1:17:10.500 --> 1:17:12.860
 I got into my twenties, then in my thirties,

1:17:12.860 --> 1:17:15.260
 and realized that's not the way to live.

1:17:15.260 --> 1:17:17.460
 So I've worked very hard to get to this point

1:17:17.460 --> 1:17:20.700
 where I almost never get stressed, never.

1:17:20.700 --> 1:17:23.100
 There's nothing that, I've never gotten angry in my lab.

1:17:23.100 --> 1:17:24.100
 I've got 20 kids.

1:17:24.100 --> 1:17:25.580
 Sometimes it's like a,

1:17:25.580 --> 1:17:28.300
 most of the time it's like a kindergarten.

1:17:28.300 --> 1:17:29.980
 I haven't lost my temper.

1:17:29.980 --> 1:17:32.380
 I'm very calm, but that's intentional.

1:17:32.380 --> 1:17:34.420
 And I don't worry about stuff.

1:17:34.420 --> 1:17:37.900
 Millions of dollars, billions of dollars at stake sometimes.

1:17:39.060 --> 1:17:39.900
 Keep it cool.

1:17:39.900 --> 1:17:40.740
 It's only life.

1:17:40.740 --> 1:17:42.740
 We're all headed to the same place anyway.

1:17:42.740 --> 1:17:44.260
 Don't worry about it.

1:17:44.260 --> 1:17:47.740
 But to answer your question, I think in a better way,

1:17:47.740 --> 1:17:49.740
 if you manipulate the brain of an animal,

1:17:50.660 --> 1:17:51.500
 I'll give you an example.

1:17:51.500 --> 1:17:53.780
 If we turn on this CERT gene that I mentioned,

1:17:53.780 --> 1:17:56.660
 CERT1, we, a good friend of mine at WashU,

1:17:56.660 --> 1:17:58.060
 Sheena Mai did this.

1:17:58.060 --> 1:18:00.420
 They upregulated that gene

1:18:00.420 --> 1:18:03.180
 just in the neurons of the animal.

1:18:03.180 --> 1:18:04.740
 It lived longer.

1:18:04.740 --> 1:18:06.900
 So that's sufficient to extend lifespan.

1:18:06.900 --> 1:18:09.980
 We also know that you can manipulate the part of the brain

1:18:09.980 --> 1:18:10.980
 called the hypothalamus,

1:18:10.980 --> 1:18:15.060
 which leeches a lot of chemicals into the body and proteins,

1:18:15.060 --> 1:18:17.060
 most of which we don't know yet,

1:18:17.060 --> 1:18:19.700
 but just changing the inflammation of that little organ

1:18:20.980 --> 1:18:22.860
 or part of the brain is sufficient

1:18:22.860 --> 1:18:24.900
 to make animals live longer as well.

1:18:24.900 --> 1:18:26.460
 So get your brain in order first

1:18:26.460 --> 1:18:29.420
 before you tackle anything else, I would say.

1:18:29.420 --> 1:18:31.660
 So you kind of mentioned this,

1:18:31.660 --> 1:18:34.420
 with the inside tracker, there's ability

1:18:34.420 --> 1:18:38.340
 to take blood measurement and then infer from that

1:18:39.420 --> 1:18:40.980
 a bunch of different things about your body

1:18:40.980 --> 1:18:44.700
 and how you can improve the longevity.

1:18:44.700 --> 1:18:47.060
 And you've also mentioned saliva

1:18:47.060 --> 1:18:52.060
 and more efficient ways to get data.

1:18:54.020 --> 1:18:55.420
 What does that involve?

1:18:55.420 --> 1:18:57.380
 What's the future of data collection look like

1:18:57.380 --> 1:18:59.220
 for the human biological system?

1:18:59.220 --> 1:19:01.740
 Right, well, yeah, the issue with blood is

1:19:01.740 --> 1:19:03.380
 you need someone to take it.

1:19:03.380 --> 1:19:06.060
 I mean, or you prick your finger, which hurts.

1:19:06.060 --> 1:19:07.100
 So you've got to have something better.

1:19:07.100 --> 1:19:08.980
 So I think what the future looks like

1:19:08.980 --> 1:19:12.380
 is that you'll spit onto a little piece of paper

1:19:12.380 --> 1:19:14.740
 and stick it in a machine and it'll do that for you.

1:19:14.740 --> 1:19:15.620
 But we're not there yet.

1:19:15.620 --> 1:19:20.620
 So the intermediate future that I'm building right now

1:19:20.980 --> 1:19:24.180
 is that you would take a swab of the inside of your mouth,

1:19:24.180 --> 1:19:26.740
 which is the easiest way to take cells out of your body

1:19:26.740 --> 1:19:28.340
 and just ship them off.

1:19:28.340 --> 1:19:30.780
 Okay, so it's called a buckle swab.

1:19:30.780 --> 1:19:32.900
 I think we became very used to that.

1:19:32.900 --> 1:19:34.340
 Right now, because of COVID,

1:19:34.340 --> 1:19:36.100
 people don't like going to the doctor as much.

1:19:36.100 --> 1:19:36.940
 They don't like going out.

1:19:36.940 --> 1:19:38.700
 They just want to have home tests.

1:19:38.700 --> 1:19:40.780
 And so that I think is the next 10 years

1:19:40.780 --> 1:19:43.140
 where you'll get a kit in the mail,

1:19:43.140 --> 1:19:45.300
 you'll swab your cheeks, stick it back in an envelope,

1:19:45.300 --> 1:19:48.700
 send it off and a week later you have

1:19:48.700 --> 1:19:52.900
 either a doctor's report or a health recommendation.

1:19:52.900 --> 1:19:54.980
 And what can you get off a cheek swab?

1:19:54.980 --> 1:19:55.860
 Well, you can get anything.

1:19:55.860 --> 1:19:58.380
 You can get hormones, stress levels,

1:19:58.380 --> 1:20:00.900
 stress hormones, blood glucose levels.

1:20:00.900 --> 1:20:04.380
 You can also tell your age reasonably accurately doing that,

1:20:04.380 --> 1:20:05.900
 actually quite accurately.

1:20:05.900 --> 1:20:08.260
 And those clocks can not just tell you

1:20:08.260 --> 1:20:10.220
 how you're doing over time,

1:20:10.220 --> 1:20:12.220
 but can be used to give you recommendations

1:20:12.220 --> 1:20:14.220
 to slow that process down.

1:20:14.220 --> 1:20:16.620
 Cause some people sometimes are 10 years older biologically

1:20:16.620 --> 1:20:19.580
 than their actual chronological age.

1:20:19.580 --> 1:20:21.940
 I mean, why does it matter how many times

1:20:21.940 --> 1:20:23.740
 the earth's gone around the sun seriously?

1:20:23.740 --> 1:20:24.940
 Who cares about birthdays?

1:20:24.940 --> 1:20:27.260
 It's how long your body's clock has been ticking

1:20:27.260 --> 1:20:28.580
 and how fast.

1:20:28.580 --> 1:20:31.060
 So I could take a cheek swab from you today, Lex,

1:20:31.060 --> 1:20:32.740
 take it back to my lab.

1:20:32.740 --> 1:20:35.420
 And we then by tomorrow tell you

1:20:35.420 --> 1:20:37.740
 how old you are biologically based on

1:20:37.740 --> 1:20:40.940
 what we call the epigenetic clock.

1:20:40.940 --> 1:20:43.140
 And you might be freaked out, you might be happy,

1:20:43.140 --> 1:20:45.580
 but either way we can advise you

1:20:45.580 --> 1:20:47.860
 on how to improve the trajectory.

1:20:47.860 --> 1:20:49.420
 Cause we know that smoking increases

1:20:49.420 --> 1:20:50.900
 the speed of that clock.

1:20:50.900 --> 1:20:54.220
 We also know that fasting and people who eat the right foods

1:20:54.220 --> 1:20:55.980
 have a slower clock.

1:20:55.980 --> 1:20:58.340
 Without that knowledge, you're flying blind.

1:20:58.340 --> 1:20:59.820
 But I like the idea of a swab,

1:20:59.820 --> 1:21:01.260
 cause it's just so easy.

1:21:01.260 --> 1:21:03.260
 A lot of us have done something like that for COVID tests.

1:21:03.260 --> 1:21:04.100
 It's not a big deal.

1:21:04.100 --> 1:21:06.180
 I've been doing a nonstop rapid antigen test.

1:21:06.180 --> 1:21:11.060
 So let me say that particular one rapid antigen test,

1:21:11.060 --> 1:21:12.700
 they've been a source of frustration for me

1:21:12.700 --> 1:21:14.860
 because like everybody should be doing it.

1:21:14.860 --> 1:21:16.100
 It's so easy.

1:21:16.100 --> 1:21:18.420
 We've also been working in my lab on democratizing

1:21:18.420 --> 1:21:20.740
 these tests to bring them down from a few hundred bucks

1:21:20.740 --> 1:21:22.060
 to a dollar.

1:21:22.060 --> 1:21:22.980
 So just to clarify,

1:21:22.980 --> 1:21:24.260
 you're talking about not research,

1:21:24.260 --> 1:21:25.820
 you're talking about like company stuff,

1:21:25.820 --> 1:21:28.620
 like actual consumer facing things?

1:21:28.620 --> 1:21:29.460
 Well, right.

1:21:29.460 --> 1:21:30.980
 The research on bringing the price down

1:21:30.980 --> 1:21:32.940
 has occurred in my lab at Harvard.

1:21:32.940 --> 1:21:35.100
 And then that intellectual property is being licensed

1:21:35.100 --> 1:21:37.060
 and has been licensed out to a company

1:21:37.060 --> 1:21:40.300
 that will be consumer facing.

1:21:40.300 --> 1:21:43.340
 So anybody for a small amount of money can do this.

1:21:43.340 --> 1:21:46.420
 Well, you got subscriber number one obsessed.

1:21:46.420 --> 1:21:48.660
 I think that's a beautiful, beautiful idea.

1:21:48.660 --> 1:21:51.460
 So somebody who maybe I would have been more hesitant

1:21:51.460 --> 1:21:53.580
 about it until COVID,

1:21:54.500 --> 1:21:56.300
 but the home tests are super easy.

1:21:56.300 --> 1:21:59.340
 I almost wanted to share that data with the world,

1:21:59.340 --> 1:22:01.820
 like in some way, not the entirety of the data,

1:22:01.820 --> 1:22:05.740
 but like some visualization of like how I'm doing.

1:22:05.740 --> 1:22:09.380
 Like, it's almost like when you share,

1:22:09.380 --> 1:22:11.420
 if you had like a long run or something like that,

1:22:11.420 --> 1:22:14.540
 I wish I could share because it inspires others.

1:22:14.540 --> 1:22:16.900
 And then you can have a conversation about like,

1:22:16.900 --> 1:22:18.780
 well, what are the hacks that you've tried

1:22:18.780 --> 1:22:21.380
 and have a conversation about like how to improve lifestyle

1:22:21.380 --> 1:22:23.660
 and those kinds of things that's grounded in data.

1:22:23.660 --> 1:22:25.580
 That's exactly, that's what's gonna happen.

1:22:25.580 --> 1:22:27.700
 Now, everything's anonymous, of course.

1:22:27.700 --> 1:22:29.620
 We talked about security there,

1:22:29.620 --> 1:22:32.540
 but once it's anonymized, you can then plot these numbers.

1:22:32.540 --> 1:22:35.580
 And I've plotted my epigenetic age

1:22:35.580 --> 1:22:37.300
 versus hundreds of other people

1:22:37.300 --> 1:22:39.060
 who have taken this test now.

1:22:39.060 --> 1:22:41.460
 And I can tell you where I fit relative to others

1:22:41.460 --> 1:22:43.580
 in terms of my biological age.

1:22:43.580 --> 1:22:44.980
 And I'm happy to share that with you

1:22:44.980 --> 1:22:46.340
 because it's pretty low.

1:22:47.260 --> 1:22:48.500
 You can choose to share it, of course,

1:22:48.500 --> 1:22:50.460
 not everyone wants to share that.

1:22:50.460 --> 1:22:52.220
 But when you go to the doctor,

1:22:52.220 --> 1:22:54.860
 first of all, your doctor does treat you

1:22:54.860 --> 1:22:55.940
 as though you're an average person

1:22:55.940 --> 1:22:58.620
 and none of us are average, there's no such thing.

1:22:58.620 --> 1:23:00.300
 But second of all, we never know

1:23:00.300 --> 1:23:01.740
 how we're doing relative to others

1:23:01.740 --> 1:23:05.820
 because we all, most of us, we don't share our information.

1:23:05.820 --> 1:23:08.060
 So we might have this number and that number,

1:23:08.060 --> 1:23:10.220
 but do you know that your numbers are good for your age

1:23:10.220 --> 1:23:11.300
 or not?

1:23:11.300 --> 1:23:12.740
 You have no idea.

1:23:12.740 --> 1:23:14.540
 Even your doctor probably doesn't even know.

1:23:14.540 --> 1:23:16.340
 So this graph that I'm talking about

1:23:16.340 --> 1:23:18.020
 is the beginning of a world where you can say,

1:23:18.020 --> 1:23:18.940
 how am I doing?

1:23:18.940 --> 1:23:22.700
 For the two of us, we're white and we're male

1:23:22.700 --> 1:23:25.380
 and we're this age and we do this.

1:23:26.380 --> 1:23:27.220
 Are we good?

1:23:27.220 --> 1:23:28.580
 Are we doing the right things or the wrong things?

1:23:28.580 --> 1:23:30.420
 Do we need to fix certain things?

1:23:30.420 --> 1:23:32.100
 And this is what the future is.

1:23:32.100 --> 1:23:35.340
 It's forget about just experimenting

1:23:35.340 --> 1:23:36.260
 and not knowing the result.

1:23:36.260 --> 1:23:38.500
 I mean, who doesn't experiment and doesn't look at the data?

1:23:38.500 --> 1:23:40.180
 No one, it makes no sense.

1:23:40.180 --> 1:23:41.180
 So we're gonna enter a world

1:23:41.180 --> 1:23:43.460
 where we have a dashboard on our body,

1:23:43.460 --> 1:23:46.420
 the swabs, the blood tests, the biosensors

1:23:46.420 --> 1:23:48.500
 where our doctors can look at that,

1:23:48.500 --> 1:23:51.580
 but we can also look at it and they can recommend,

1:23:51.580 --> 1:23:52.980
 go to this restaurant down the road.

1:23:52.980 --> 1:23:54.380
 They've got this great meal.

1:23:54.380 --> 1:23:56.300
 It's high in whatever you need today

1:23:56.300 --> 1:23:58.460
 because you're lacking vitamin D and vitamin K2.

1:23:58.460 --> 1:23:59.300
 Go for it.

1:24:00.380 --> 1:24:03.260
 Ridiculous question or perhaps not.

1:24:03.260 --> 1:24:05.100
 If you look maybe 50 years from now

1:24:05.100 --> 1:24:07.740
 or 100 years from now, a person born then,

1:24:07.740 --> 1:24:09.260
 what do you think is a good goal

1:24:09.260 --> 1:24:12.340
 in terms of how long a person would live?

1:24:12.340 --> 1:24:16.020
 What is the maximum longevity that we can achieve

1:24:16.020 --> 1:24:18.460
 through the methods that we have today

1:24:19.860 --> 1:24:21.140
 or are developing some of the things

1:24:21.140 --> 1:24:25.100
 we've been talking about in terms of genetics,

1:24:25.100 --> 1:24:26.260
 in terms of biology?

1:24:27.140 --> 1:24:28.140
 Is there a number?

1:24:29.660 --> 1:24:31.740
 Right, well, so it changes all the time

1:24:31.740 --> 1:24:33.420
 because technology is changing so quickly.

1:24:33.420 --> 1:24:36.260
 I keep revising the number upward,

1:24:36.260 --> 1:24:38.660
 but I would say that if you do the right things

1:24:38.660 --> 1:24:40.780
 during your life and start at an early age,

1:24:40.780 --> 1:24:43.260
 let's say 25, we don't want malnutrition, starvation.

1:24:43.260 --> 1:24:45.160
 That's not what I'm talking about.

1:24:45.160 --> 1:24:48.860
 But in your 20s, start eating the kind of diets

1:24:48.860 --> 1:24:51.880
 that I talked about, skipping meals.

1:24:51.880 --> 1:24:55.940
 In animals, that gives you an extra 20 to 30%.

1:24:55.940 --> 1:24:57.820
 We don't know if that's true for humans

1:24:57.820 --> 1:25:02.080
 and even 5% more would be a big deal for the planet.

1:25:03.220 --> 1:25:06.640
 I think that we should all aim to at least reach a century.

1:25:08.540 --> 1:25:09.380
 I'm a little bit behind.

1:25:09.380 --> 1:25:12.040
 I was born too early to benefit the most

1:25:12.040 --> 1:25:13.820
 from all of this discovery.

1:25:13.820 --> 1:25:16.000
 Those of you who are in your 20s,

1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:18.700
 you should definitely aim to reach a hundred.

1:25:18.700 --> 1:25:19.660
 I don't see why not.

1:25:20.860 --> 1:25:23.140
 Consider this, this is really important.

1:25:23.140 --> 1:25:25.040
 The average lifespan of a human

1:25:25.040 --> 1:25:28.120
 that looks after themselves but doesn't pay attention

1:25:29.500 --> 1:25:31.000
 is about 80, okay?

1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:34.160
 Japan, that's the average age for a male, a bit higher.

1:25:35.220 --> 1:25:37.220
 If you do the right things in your life,

1:25:37.220 --> 1:25:41.100
 which is eat healthy food, don't overeat,

1:25:41.100 --> 1:25:42.900
 don't become obese, do a bit of exercise,

1:25:42.900 --> 1:25:44.720
 get good sleep and don't stress,

1:25:44.720 --> 1:25:47.220
 that gives you on average 14 extra years.

1:25:47.220 --> 1:25:49.060
 That gets you to 94.

1:25:49.060 --> 1:25:50.260
 So getting to a hundred,

1:25:50.260 --> 1:25:52.540
 if you just focus on what I'm talking about,

1:25:52.540 --> 1:25:53.700
 it's not a big deal.

1:25:53.700 --> 1:25:54.620
 So what's the maximum?

1:25:54.620 --> 1:25:57.380
 Well, we know that one human made it to 122

1:25:57.380 --> 1:26:00.360
 and a number of them make it into their teens.

1:26:00.360 --> 1:26:02.140
 I think that's also the next level

1:26:02.140 --> 1:26:06.300
 of where we can get to with the types of technologies

1:26:06.300 --> 1:26:07.580
 that I'm talking about.

1:26:07.580 --> 1:26:09.980
 Medicines, like I mentioned rapamycin,

1:26:09.980 --> 1:26:12.840
 there's one called metformin, which is the diabetes drug,

1:26:12.840 --> 1:26:14.420
 which I take.

1:26:14.420 --> 1:26:16.460
 That in combination with these lifestyle changes

1:26:16.460 --> 1:26:18.380
 should get us beyond a hundred.

1:26:18.380 --> 1:26:19.640
 How long can we ultimately live?

1:26:19.640 --> 1:26:22.260
 Well, there's no maximum limit to human lifespan.

1:26:22.260 --> 1:26:24.600
 Why can a whale live 300 years, but we cannot?

1:26:24.600 --> 1:26:26.240
 We're basically the same structure.

1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:27.980
 We just need to learn from them.

1:26:27.980 --> 1:26:31.060
 So anyone who says, oh, you max out at X,

1:26:31.060 --> 1:26:33.300
 I think is full of it.

1:26:33.300 --> 1:26:35.360
 There's nothing that I've seen that says

1:26:35.360 --> 1:26:37.520
 biological organisms have to die.

1:26:37.520 --> 1:26:39.500
 There are trees that live for thousands of years

1:26:39.500 --> 1:26:42.480
 and their biochemistry is pretty close to ours.

1:26:42.480 --> 1:26:44.960
 What do you think it means to live for a very long time?

1:26:44.960 --> 1:26:47.300
 Let's say if it's 200 years we're talking about

1:26:47.300 --> 1:26:48.660
 or a thousand years.

1:26:50.940 --> 1:26:54.580
 There's some sense, you could argue,

1:26:54.580 --> 1:26:58.020
 that there is immortal organisms already living on Earth,

1:26:58.020 --> 1:26:59.020
 like there's bacteria.

1:26:59.020 --> 1:27:03.740
 So there's certain living organisms

1:27:03.740 --> 1:27:07.940
 that in some fundamental way do not die

1:27:07.940 --> 1:27:10.260
 because they keep replicating their genetic,

1:27:10.260 --> 1:27:12.660
 they keep like cloning themselves.

1:27:12.660 --> 1:27:17.660
 Is it the same human if we can somehow persist

1:27:19.100 --> 1:27:23.940
 the human mind, like copy, clone certain aspects

1:27:23.940 --> 1:27:26.400
 and just keep replacing body parts?

1:27:27.380 --> 1:27:30.460
 Do you think that's another way to achieve immortality?

1:27:30.460 --> 1:27:33.780
 To achieve a prolonged sort of increased longevity

1:27:33.780 --> 1:27:37.140
 is to replace the parts that break easily

1:27:37.140 --> 1:27:42.140
 and keep, because actually from your theory of aging

1:27:42.220 --> 1:27:44.460
 as a degradation of information,

1:27:44.460 --> 1:27:46.540
 so an information theory view of aging,

1:27:48.260 --> 1:27:51.480
 like what is the key information that makes a human?

1:27:51.480 --> 1:27:53.420
 Can we persist that information

1:27:53.420 --> 1:27:56.200
 and just replace the trivial parts?

1:27:57.300 --> 1:27:59.340
 Yeah, I mean the short answer is yes.

1:27:59.340 --> 1:28:01.340
 We're already replacing body parts

1:28:01.340 --> 1:28:03.820
 but what makes us human is our brain.

1:28:03.820 --> 1:28:07.380
 Everything else is suboptimal except our brain.

1:28:08.740 --> 1:28:13.660
 The ability to replace actual neurons is really hard.

1:28:13.660 --> 1:28:16.220
 I think it might be easy to upload

1:28:16.220 --> 1:28:19.180
 rather than replace neurons because they're so tight,

1:28:19.180 --> 1:28:22.280
 it's such a network and just perturbing the system.

1:28:24.380 --> 1:28:25.720
 It's Roger and Gizcat.

1:28:25.720 --> 1:28:28.760
 You change everything once you get in there.

1:28:28.760 --> 1:28:31.800
 The problem is, well, I guess the solution,

1:28:31.800 --> 1:28:34.180
 let me go to the solution that's more interesting.

1:28:34.180 --> 1:28:35.980
 What we're learning is that if you reverse

1:28:35.980 --> 1:28:37.380
 the age of nerve cells,

1:28:38.660 --> 1:28:41.420
 it looks like they get their memories back.

1:28:41.420 --> 1:28:42.660
 So the memories are not lost.

1:28:42.660 --> 1:28:45.300
 They're just that the cells don't know how to interpret them

1:28:45.300 --> 1:28:46.860
 and function correctly.

1:28:46.860 --> 1:28:48.860
 And this is one of the things we're studying in my lab.

1:28:48.860 --> 1:28:50.420
 If you take an old mouse that has learned something

1:28:50.420 --> 1:28:53.660
 when it was young but forgotten, does it get that back?

1:28:53.660 --> 1:28:56.460
 And all evidence points to that being true.

1:28:56.460 --> 1:28:59.620
 So I'd rather go in and rejuvenate the brain as it sits

1:28:59.620 --> 1:29:01.280
 rather than replace individual cells,

1:29:01.280 --> 1:29:03.120
 which would be really hard.

1:29:03.120 --> 1:29:06.700
 What do you think about like efforts like Neuralink,

1:29:06.700 --> 1:29:10.260
 which basically you mentioned uploading,

1:29:10.260 --> 1:29:11.700
 are trying to figure out,

1:29:11.700 --> 1:29:13.660
 so creating brain computer interfaces

1:29:13.660 --> 1:29:14.620
 that are trying to figure out

1:29:14.620 --> 1:29:16.880
 how to communicate with the brain.

1:29:16.880 --> 1:29:19.380
 But one of the features of that is trying to record

1:29:19.380 --> 1:29:22.740
 the human brain more and more accurately.

1:29:22.740 --> 1:29:26.080
 Do you have hope for that to,

1:29:27.220 --> 1:29:30.780
 of course, it will lead to us better understanding

1:29:30.780 --> 1:29:33.260
 from a neuroscience perspective, the human mind,

1:29:33.260 --> 1:29:36.060
 but do you have hope for it increasing longevity

1:29:36.060 --> 1:29:38.340
 in terms of how it's used?

1:29:38.340 --> 1:29:41.180
 I think that it can help with certain diseases.

1:29:41.180 --> 1:29:42.980
 But I see, at least within our lifetime,

1:29:42.980 --> 1:29:45.300
 that's the best use of it is to be able to replace

1:29:45.300 --> 1:29:47.620
 parts of the body that are not functioning,

1:29:47.620 --> 1:29:50.140
 such as the retina and other parts,

1:29:50.140 --> 1:29:51.840
 the visual cortex back here.

1:29:51.840 --> 1:29:53.900
 That's going to be doable.

1:29:53.900 --> 1:29:55.300
 In terms of longevity,

1:29:55.300 --> 1:29:58.040
 maybe we could put something on the hypothalamus

1:29:58.040 --> 1:30:00.780
 and start secreting those hormones and get that back.

1:30:02.300 --> 1:30:06.780
 Ultimately, I think the best way to preserve the brain

1:30:06.780 --> 1:30:10.780
 is going to be to record it.

1:30:10.780 --> 1:30:12.700
 But also, I think it's going to require death,

1:30:12.700 --> 1:30:16.980
 unfortunately, to then do very detailed scans,

1:30:16.980 --> 1:30:20.580
 even if you have enough time and money, atomic microscopy,

1:30:20.580 --> 1:30:22.540
 and rebuild the brain from scratch.

1:30:22.540 --> 1:30:24.500
 Rebuild from scratch, yeah.

1:30:24.500 --> 1:30:28.860
 We are living more and more in a digital world.

1:30:28.860 --> 1:30:31.500
 I wonder if the scanning is good enough

1:30:31.500 --> 1:30:34.420
 for the critical things in terms of memories,

1:30:34.420 --> 1:30:36.420
 in terms of the particular quirks

1:30:36.420 --> 1:30:38.120
 of your cognitive processes.

1:30:38.120 --> 1:30:40.420
 They're not, they're not, yeah.

1:30:40.420 --> 1:30:42.040
 We're not close, yes,

1:30:42.040 --> 1:30:44.580
 but we've made quite a bit of progress,

1:30:44.580 --> 1:30:49.580
 so if you're an exponential type of person.

1:30:50.220 --> 1:30:52.140
 Yeah, well, let's dream a little here.

1:30:52.140 --> 1:30:52.980
 Yes, that's the point.

1:30:52.980 --> 1:30:56.220
 The way it would work, that I could see it working is,

1:30:56.220 --> 1:31:00.880
 so you take a single cell slice through your dead brain,

1:31:00.880 --> 1:31:01.860
 and we can now,

1:31:01.860 --> 1:31:04.820
 the problem with the engineering aspect is that,

1:31:04.820 --> 1:31:07.420
 the engineering is, the physical aspect of the brain

1:31:07.420 --> 1:31:09.700
 is not even half the problem.

1:31:09.700 --> 1:31:12.980
 The problem is which genes are switched on and off.

1:31:12.980 --> 1:31:15.140
 This experience that we're having here

1:31:15.140 --> 1:31:18.260
 is altering certain genes in neurons

1:31:18.260 --> 1:31:22.060
 that will be preserved, hopefully, for a number of decades,

1:31:22.060 --> 1:31:25.300
 but you cannot see that with a microscope easily,

1:31:25.300 --> 1:31:27.780
 but there are technologies invented,

1:31:27.780 --> 1:31:30.740
 actually just down the hall in the building I'm at,

1:31:30.740 --> 1:31:33.520
 George Church invented a way, his lab invented a way,

1:31:33.520 --> 1:31:35.980
 to look at which genes are switched on and off,

1:31:36.840 --> 1:31:40.100
 not only in a single cell, which any lab can do these days,

1:31:40.100 --> 1:31:42.980
 but in situ, where it's situated in the brain.

1:31:42.980 --> 1:31:45.240
 So you can say, okay, this nerve cell,

1:31:45.240 --> 1:31:47.700
 had these genes switched on and these switched off,

1:31:47.700 --> 1:31:49.740
 we can recreate that,

1:31:49.740 --> 1:31:50.980
 but just scanning the brain

1:31:50.980 --> 1:31:52.540
 and looking how the nerves are touching each other

1:31:52.540 --> 1:31:53.540
 is not gonna do it.

1:31:54.820 --> 1:31:55.900
 Wow, okay.

1:31:55.900 --> 1:31:59.260
 So you have to scan the full biology, the full details.

1:31:59.260 --> 1:32:00.420
 And look at the epigenome.

1:32:00.420 --> 1:32:01.580
 And the epigenome too.

1:32:01.580 --> 1:32:03.140
 Yeah, which genes are on and off.

1:32:03.140 --> 1:32:05.080
 It's just easier to reset the epigenome

1:32:05.080 --> 1:32:06.500
 and get them to work like they used to.

1:32:06.500 --> 1:32:07.540
 True, true.

1:32:07.540 --> 1:32:08.380
 We're doing that now.

1:32:08.380 --> 1:32:09.760
 Use the hardware we already have,

1:32:09.760 --> 1:32:13.860
 just figure out how to make that hardware last longer.

1:32:13.860 --> 1:32:15.700
 Right, ultimately information will be lost,

1:32:15.700 --> 1:32:19.380
 even genetic information degrades slowly through mutation.

1:32:19.380 --> 1:32:22.540
 So immortality is not achievable through that means,

1:32:22.540 --> 1:32:25.280
 though I think we could potentially reset the body

1:32:25.280 --> 1:32:28.480
 hundreds of times and live for thousands of years.

1:32:28.480 --> 1:32:31.540
 Okay, so we talked about biology.

1:32:31.540 --> 1:32:34.620
 Let's, forgive me, but let's talk about philosophy

1:32:34.620 --> 1:32:36.740
 for just a brief moment.

1:32:36.740 --> 1:32:38.740
 So somebody I've enjoyed reading,

1:32:38.740 --> 1:32:40.700
 Ernest Becker wrote The Denial of Death.

1:32:40.700 --> 1:32:42.980
 There's also Martin Heidegger.

1:32:42.980 --> 1:32:47.820
 There's a bunch of philosophers who claim

1:32:47.820 --> 1:32:51.980
 that most people live life in denial of death.

1:32:51.980 --> 1:32:56.980
 Sort of we don't fully internalize

1:32:58.400 --> 1:33:00.140
 the idea that we're going to die.

1:33:04.220 --> 1:33:07.000
 Because if we did, as they say,

1:33:07.000 --> 1:33:10.260
 there will be a kind of terror of,

1:33:11.220 --> 1:33:14.120
 I mean a deep fear of death.

1:33:15.380 --> 1:33:17.280
 The fact that we don't know what's,

1:33:17.280 --> 1:33:22.280
 like we almost don't know what to do with non existence,

1:33:23.260 --> 1:33:24.860
 with disappearing.

1:33:24.860 --> 1:33:28.300
 Like our, the way we draw meaning from life

1:33:28.300 --> 1:33:30.860
 seems to be grounded in the fact that we exist

1:33:30.860 --> 1:33:34.620
 and that we at some point will not exist is terrifying.

1:33:34.620 --> 1:33:37.660
 And so we live in an illusion that we're not going to die

1:33:37.660 --> 1:33:39.700
 and we run from that terror.

1:33:39.700 --> 1:33:41.740
 That's what Ernest Becker would say.

1:33:41.740 --> 1:33:44.260
 Do you think there's any truth to that?

1:33:44.260 --> 1:33:45.460
 Oh, I know there's truth to that.

1:33:45.460 --> 1:33:47.820
 I experience it every day when I talk to people.

1:33:47.820 --> 1:33:49.700
 We have to live that way.

1:33:49.700 --> 1:33:51.420
 Although unfortunately I can't,

1:33:51.420 --> 1:33:56.420
 but for most people it's extremely distressing

1:33:56.540 --> 1:33:59.380
 to think about their own mortality.

1:33:59.380 --> 1:34:00.580
 We think about it occasionally.

1:34:00.580 --> 1:34:02.300
 And if we really thought about it every day,

1:34:02.300 --> 1:34:04.020
 we'd probably be brought to tears.

1:34:04.020 --> 1:34:05.780
 How much we not just miss ourselves,

1:34:05.780 --> 1:34:07.580
 but miss our family, our friends.

1:34:10.140 --> 1:34:14.420
 All living life forms have evolved to not want to die.

1:34:14.420 --> 1:34:15.680
 And when I mean want,

1:34:15.680 --> 1:34:18.220
 biochemically, genetically, physically.

1:34:18.220 --> 1:34:21.660
 That yeast cell, the cells that I studied at MIT,

1:34:21.660 --> 1:34:23.700
 they were fighting for their lives.

1:34:23.700 --> 1:34:25.260
 They didn't think,

1:34:25.260 --> 1:34:28.980
 but our brain has evolved the same survival aspect.

1:34:28.980 --> 1:34:30.380
 Of course, we don't want to die.

1:34:30.380 --> 1:34:32.540
 But the problem for us, unfortunately,

1:34:32.540 --> 1:34:34.960
 it's a curse and a blessing is that we're now conscious.

1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:37.180
 We know that we're going to die.

1:34:37.180 --> 1:34:40.300
 Most species that have ever existed don't.

1:34:40.300 --> 1:34:42.300
 That's a burden, that's a curse.

1:34:42.300 --> 1:34:43.660
 And so what I think has happened is

1:34:43.660 --> 1:34:46.900
 we've evolved certainly to want to live for a long time,

1:34:46.900 --> 1:34:49.140
 perhaps never want to die.

1:34:49.140 --> 1:34:52.160
 But the thought about dying is so traumatic

1:34:52.160 --> 1:34:55.620
 that there is an innate part of our brains.

1:34:55.620 --> 1:34:59.260
 And it's probably genetically wired to not think about it.

1:35:00.940 --> 1:35:03.180
 I really think that's part of being human.

1:35:03.180 --> 1:35:06.020
 Because, think about tribes that obsessed

1:35:06.020 --> 1:35:09.620
 with longevity every day and that we're going to die.

1:35:09.620 --> 1:35:12.300
 They probably didn't make much technological progress

1:35:12.300 --> 1:35:14.540
 because they were just crying in their huts every day

1:35:14.540 --> 1:35:16.220
 or on the Savannah.

1:35:16.220 --> 1:35:18.060
 So I really think that we've evolved

1:35:18.060 --> 1:35:20.340
 to naturally deny aging.

1:35:20.340 --> 1:35:23.180
 And it's one of the problems that I face in my career.

1:35:23.180 --> 1:35:26.780
 And when I speak publicly and on social media

1:35:26.780 --> 1:35:28.340
 is that it's shocking.

1:35:28.340 --> 1:35:29.920
 People don't want to think about their age,

1:35:29.920 --> 1:35:31.720
 but I think it's getting better.

1:35:31.720 --> 1:35:33.940
 I think my book has helped.

1:35:33.940 --> 1:35:35.220
 These tests that we're developing

1:35:35.220 --> 1:35:38.340
 should help people understand it's not a problem

1:35:38.340 --> 1:35:40.300
 to think about your longterm health.

1:35:40.300 --> 1:35:41.820
 In fact, if you don't,

1:35:41.820 --> 1:35:44.060
 you're going to reach 80 and really regret it.

1:35:45.260 --> 1:35:47.740
 And the other side of it, so again, Ernest Becker,

1:35:47.740 --> 1:35:50.140
 but also Viktor Frankl recommended highly

1:35:50.140 --> 1:35:51.340
 Man's Search for Meaning.

1:35:52.300 --> 1:35:54.900
 Bernard Williams is a moral philosopher.

1:35:54.900 --> 1:35:58.620
 They kind of argue that this knowledge of death,

1:35:58.620 --> 1:36:03.620
 even if we often don't contemplate it, we do at times.

1:36:03.840 --> 1:36:06.960
 And the very, what you call the curse,

1:36:06.960 --> 1:36:10.620
 which I agree with you, it's a curse and a blessing

1:36:10.620 --> 1:36:13.900
 that we're able to contemplate our own mortality.

1:36:13.900 --> 1:36:16.580
 That gives meaning to life.

1:36:16.580 --> 1:36:18.860
 So death gives meaning to life,

1:36:18.860 --> 1:36:21.140
 is what Viktor Frankl argues.

1:36:21.140 --> 1:36:22.600
 I would probably argue the same.

1:36:22.600 --> 1:36:25.180
 There's something about the scarcity of life

1:36:25.180 --> 1:36:27.140
 and contemplating that,

1:36:27.140 --> 1:36:30.180
 that makes each moment that much sweeter.

1:36:30.180 --> 1:36:32.380
 Is there something to that?

1:36:32.380 --> 1:36:33.860
 I think it's individual.

1:36:33.860 --> 1:36:35.980
 In my case, it's completely wrong.

1:36:35.980 --> 1:36:39.820
 I appreciate you saying that.

1:36:39.820 --> 1:36:41.860
 I don't get joy out of every day

1:36:41.860 --> 1:36:43.780
 because I think I'm going to die.

1:36:43.780 --> 1:36:46.060
 I get joy out of every day because every day is joyous

1:36:46.060 --> 1:36:47.460
 and I make it that way.

1:36:47.460 --> 1:36:50.460
 And even if I thought I was going to live forever,

1:36:50.460 --> 1:36:53.140
 I would still be enjoying this moment just as much.

1:36:54.580 --> 1:36:56.340
 And I bet you would too.

1:36:56.340 --> 1:36:59.900
 Well, I think about that a lot.

1:36:59.900 --> 1:37:03.580
 I think it's very difficult to know.

1:37:03.580 --> 1:37:06.740
 I'm almost afraid that I wouldn't enjoy it as much

1:37:06.740 --> 1:37:07.980
 if I was immortal.

1:37:07.980 --> 1:37:11.900
 I'm almost afraid to want to be immortal or to live longer

1:37:11.900 --> 1:37:16.900
 because it perhaps is a kind of justification

1:37:18.460 --> 1:37:21.700
 for me to accept that I'm going to die.

1:37:21.700 --> 1:37:23.420
 It's saying like, oh, if I was immortal,

1:37:23.420 --> 1:37:26.160
 I wouldn't be able to enjoy life as much as I do.

1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:29.240
 But it's very possible that I would enjoy just as much.

1:37:30.260 --> 1:37:34.220
 Of course, enjoying life, whether you're immortal or not,

1:37:34.220 --> 1:37:35.540
 takes work.

1:37:35.540 --> 1:37:38.580
 Like it requires you to have the right kind

1:37:38.580 --> 1:37:39.820
 of frame of mind.

1:37:39.820 --> 1:37:42.460
 You can discover, you can focus your mind

1:37:42.460 --> 1:37:44.500
 on the ugliness of life.

1:37:44.500 --> 1:37:46.900
 There's plenty of ugly things in this world

1:37:46.900 --> 1:37:47.960
 and you can focus on them.

1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:49.340
 You can complain.

1:37:49.340 --> 1:37:53.460
 Whenever like, you know, if it's raining outside,

1:37:53.460 --> 1:37:56.740
 you can focus on the fact that you have shelter

1:37:56.740 --> 1:37:58.460
 and enjoy the hell out of it.

1:37:58.460 --> 1:38:02.020
 Or you can enjoy running in the rain when it's warm

1:38:02.020 --> 1:38:05.700
 and the beauty of nature, just being one with nature.

1:38:05.700 --> 1:38:07.920
 Or you can just complain, it's fucking weather again

1:38:07.920 --> 1:38:10.420
 in Boston and then it's either always raining

1:38:10.420 --> 1:38:11.920
 or freezing, damn it.

1:38:13.920 --> 1:38:18.340
 The same thing with like wifi going out on airplanes.

1:38:18.340 --> 1:38:23.340
 You can either complain about stupid wifi

1:38:23.340 --> 1:38:25.860
 on JetBlue or something.

1:38:25.860 --> 1:38:27.620
 Or you could say like, how incredible it is

1:38:27.620 --> 1:38:30.180
 that I can fly through the sky and in a matter of hours

1:38:30.180 --> 1:38:31.700
 be anywhere else in the world.

1:38:31.700 --> 1:38:35.700
 And then I could also on occasion watch like check email

1:38:35.700 --> 1:38:39.540
 and even watch movies while connecting through satellites

1:38:39.540 --> 1:38:40.500
 that are flying through space.

1:38:40.500 --> 1:38:42.780
 So it's a matter of perspective and perhaps

1:38:42.780 --> 1:38:44.980
 there's an extra level of work required

1:38:44.980 --> 1:38:47.620
 when you're immortal because it's easier

1:38:47.620 --> 1:38:51.680
 when you're immortal or live longer to be lazy,

1:38:51.680 --> 1:38:52.980
 to delay stuff.

1:38:52.980 --> 1:38:55.020
 But if you're not, you can still derive

1:38:55.020 --> 1:38:56.460
 the same amount of joy.

1:38:56.460 --> 1:38:59.060
 It's possible, it's possible.

1:38:59.060 --> 1:38:59.900
 It's definitely possible.

1:38:59.900 --> 1:39:03.120
 In my life, I went from being the nothing's working

1:39:03.120 --> 1:39:06.660
 to every day's great to wake up to.

1:39:06.660 --> 1:39:10.460
 And I think even if you think you can live forever,

1:39:10.460 --> 1:39:12.180
 you can enjoy every day.

1:39:12.180 --> 1:39:14.040
 What I do is everything's relative.

1:39:14.940 --> 1:39:17.900
 We can compare ourselves to our neighbor who has more money

1:39:17.900 --> 1:39:20.460
 or to the flight that should have had wifi

1:39:20.460 --> 1:39:23.580
 or which is what I do, I'm still six years old remember.

1:39:23.580 --> 1:39:27.780
 What a six year old does says, look, I can,

1:39:27.780 --> 1:39:29.940
 when I tell my fingers to form a fist,

1:39:29.940 --> 1:39:31.300
 they actually do that.

1:39:31.300 --> 1:39:32.700
 That's really cool.

1:39:32.700 --> 1:39:34.740
 That's how I live my life.

1:39:34.740 --> 1:39:36.840
 I can pick up on your desk here, this metal object.

1:39:36.840 --> 1:39:39.860
 It's a metal cube, about an inch by an inch by an inch.

1:39:39.860 --> 1:39:42.560
 And I tell myself not about cubes,

1:39:42.560 --> 1:39:44.920
 but about inanimate objects.

1:39:44.920 --> 1:39:48.260
 Probably once a day I'll say, I'm a living thing.

1:39:48.260 --> 1:39:51.880
 I can think, I can move, I can eat, I am full of energy.

1:39:51.880 --> 1:39:53.920
 And there's that leaf or this cube here

1:39:53.920 --> 1:39:55.840
 that will never be alive.

1:39:55.840 --> 1:39:59.180
 That's what I look at and compare myself to.

1:39:59.180 --> 1:40:01.100
 And for as long as I live, if it's forever,

1:40:01.100 --> 1:40:04.500
 of course it won't be, but even if it was forever,

1:40:04.500 --> 1:40:07.780
 relative to this lump of metal on this table here,

1:40:07.780 --> 1:40:10.860
 we are wondrous things in the universe

1:40:10.860 --> 1:40:13.740
 and probably the most wondrous things in the universe.

1:40:13.740 --> 1:40:18.660
 Yeah, we're able to deeply appreciate the leaf or the cube

1:40:18.660 --> 1:40:20.540
 and deeply appreciate ourselves,

1:40:20.540 --> 1:40:24.400
 which is, it can be a curse, but it's mostly a gift,

1:40:24.400 --> 1:40:28.140
 especially when you're, it's such a beautiful poem.

1:40:29.040 --> 1:40:31.640
 Now I'm six, I'm as clever as clever,

1:40:31.640 --> 1:40:35.380
 so I think I'll be six now forever and ever.

1:40:35.380 --> 1:40:37.840
 That's a good thing to aspire to.

1:40:37.840 --> 1:40:40.600
 Your grandmother was onto something.

1:40:40.600 --> 1:40:43.000
 David, this is an incredible conversation.

1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:44.620
 I'm a huge fan of your work.

1:40:44.620 --> 1:40:49.320
 So thank you for wasting your valuable time with me today.

1:40:49.320 --> 1:40:50.480
 I really, really appreciate it.

1:40:50.480 --> 1:40:51.320
 This was awesome.

1:40:51.320 --> 1:40:53.960
 Thank you for having me on, Lex, appreciate it.

1:40:53.960 --> 1:40:55.480
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

1:40:55.480 --> 1:40:59.720
 with David Sinclair, and thank you to Onnit, Clear,

1:40:59.720 --> 1:41:03.600
 National Instruments, Simply Safe, and Linode.

1:41:03.600 --> 1:41:07.100
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

1:41:07.100 --> 1:41:08.680
 And now let me leave you with some words

1:41:08.680 --> 1:41:10.600
 from Arthur Schopenhauer.

1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:13.660
 All truth passes through three stages.

1:41:13.660 --> 1:41:15.460
 First, it is ridiculed.

1:41:15.460 --> 1:41:18.200
 Second, it is violently opposed.

1:41:18.200 --> 1:41:22.240
 Third, it is accepted as being self evident.

1:41:22.240 --> 1:41:26.400
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
