00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
 The following is a conversation with Jaco Willink, a retired U.S. Navy SEAL, coauthor of Extreme

00:06.000 --> 00:11.680
 Ownership, Dichotomy of Leadership, Discipline Equals Freedom, and many other excellent books,

00:11.680 --> 00:18.400
 and he's the host of Jaco's podcast. Jaco spent 20 years in the SEAL teams. He was the commander

00:18.400 --> 00:24.880
 of SEAL Team 3's Task Unit Bruiser that became the most highly decorated Special Operations unit

00:24.880 --> 00:31.680
 of the Iraq War. This conversation was intense and to the point. We agreed to talk again,

00:31.680 --> 00:38.000
 probably many times, and what I find very interesting, aside from the talk of leadership,

00:38.000 --> 00:55.280
 is the conversation about military tactics of specific battles in history.

01:25.600 --> 01:31.920
 I do happen to at times mention that I'm Russian. This is what I mean, that I got a bit of that

01:31.920 --> 01:39.360
 Russian soul. But of course who I really am is an American. This country gave me the opportunity,

01:39.360 --> 01:45.360
 the freedom to become and to be who I am, to stand as an individual. This seemingly

01:45.360 --> 01:50.800
 simple freedom to be a sovereign human being in the face of all the beauty and cruelty of life

01:50.800 --> 01:57.920
 is why I love this country. Much of life can be unfair, unjust, even tragic. But this is the

01:57.920 --> 02:04.000
 country where if I'm clever enough or card enough and just get lucky enough I have a chance to dream

02:04.000 --> 02:10.720
 big and make my dream a reality. The United States welcomed me, my family, and millions of immigrants

02:10.720 --> 02:15.280
 throughout its history so that we can make something meaningful of ourselves. To love,

02:15.280 --> 02:21.920
 to dream, to create, to find joy and meaning. It lets me be the weird kid I am who wears a suit,

02:21.920 --> 02:27.920
 talks about love, and has a fascination with robots. I know some people these days have an

02:27.920 --> 02:34.480
 aversion to pride and love for their country. I don't. I love America. I also love humanity.

02:35.040 --> 02:42.320
 I believe these two, patriotism and humanism, are not in conflict, much like loving your family and

02:42.320 --> 02:47.280
 loving your country are not in conflict. They are all manifestations of the human spirit,

02:47.280 --> 02:54.240
 longing to strive for a better world. I was born a Russian, but I believe I will die an American.

02:54.880 --> 03:01.680
 A proud American. Hopefully not too soon, but life is short. I already had one hell of a fun journey,

03:01.680 --> 03:08.080
 so I'm ready to go when it's time. This is the Lex Friedman podcast and here is my conversation

03:08.080 --> 03:14.880
 with Jaco Willink. Is it tragic or beautiful to you that some of the closest bonds that have formed

03:14.880 --> 03:24.320
 between people are through war often. I think it's both, both tragic and beautiful and for the

03:24.320 --> 03:35.440
 obvious reasons. What are the obvious reasons? Why is it so obvious? Well, it's tragic because

03:35.440 --> 03:43.040
 a lot of people die and it's beautiful because you form bonds with people that are very difficult

03:43.040 --> 03:52.400
 to break once you've been through them. What is it about the trauma of war that makes bonds

03:52.400 --> 04:00.720
 difficult to break? Because what you realize when you're in a war is that the people that are next

04:00.720 --> 04:08.240
 to you, you rely on them and they're relying on you to survive. And without them, you will not

04:08.240 --> 04:17.600
 survive. And when you realize that you need to work together as a team to, to live, that forms

04:17.600 --> 04:25.040
 a very strong bond. And there's nothing like that team outside of the realm of war. I don't know

04:25.040 --> 04:31.040
 because I've, there's a lot of things that I haven't experienced in my life, but I think the

04:31.040 --> 04:39.840
 pressure and the consequences of war, there could be similar situations in survival scenarios,

04:39.840 --> 04:46.720
 in various atrocities where people need to work together in order to survive. And I think you

04:46.720 --> 04:53.680
 could probably get something that was similar. There's a very particular nature to the kind of

04:53.680 --> 04:58.880
 war that World War II was, especially for the Soviet Union, where it didn't just influence

04:58.880 --> 05:06.480
 the lives of people. It created culture, the music, the poetry, the literature. It's in the,

05:08.000 --> 05:13.440
 it's in the way people think. It's in the way people see the world. It's in the way they talk

05:13.440 --> 05:23.520
 even still to this day. And of course, I was talking about the directly relationship between

05:23.520 --> 05:31.440
 two soldiers, but there's something about the depth of human connection that results from the

05:31.440 --> 05:37.600
 almost like reverberations of war. Like generations later, you're still close to other humans.

05:39.280 --> 05:47.920
 There's a coldness towards other humans like in Russia, but once you open up, it's depth. You

05:47.920 --> 05:55.520
 seek depth of connection versus like breadth of a career kind of thinking, how can I make friends

05:55.520 --> 06:00.320
 with this? I can move into this direction. What can this person benefit me? Instead, you seek

06:00.320 --> 06:07.120
 a depth of human connection and appreciation that brings a lot. And maybe I'm romanticizing war here,

06:07.920 --> 06:14.720
 but it feels like that's inextricably connected to World War II for Russians. Does that resonate

06:14.720 --> 06:22.320
 at all? So if you look at military training, what they do is they take people in the military

06:22.320 --> 06:26.640
 from the civilian world. They bring them into the military and they put them through bootcamp,

06:28.000 --> 06:31.520
 which is the stereotypical thing that you see on TV. You're going to get yelled at.

06:31.520 --> 06:35.040
 You're going to get screamed at. You're going to get, you're going to get put in the mud and

06:35.040 --> 06:42.320
 you're going to be made to do hard things together. And what does that do with those

06:42.320 --> 06:47.360
 civilians? Well, it gives them a common background. It gives them a common suffering

06:47.360 --> 06:53.520
 that they've been through together and they form some sort of connection, some sort of bond.

06:54.800 --> 07:00.240
 Now to make that bond a little bit stronger, after you get done with bootcamp, they send you

07:00.240 --> 07:08.160
 to advanced infantry school and you suffer some more together. And when you suffer more together,

07:08.160 --> 07:12.400
 now you're in a smaller group too, because now it's infantry. It's not supply people anymore or

07:12.960 --> 07:18.720
 logisticians. It's strictly people that are going to fight. They're infantrymen.

07:18.720 --> 07:23.520
 So they go through a school together and now they get a little bit tighter, get done with that. And

07:24.640 --> 07:29.040
 maybe you go to an airborne division. So you go to airborne school and now you all

07:29.040 --> 07:33.360
 overcome this fear of jumping out of an airplane together and you celebrate surviving that.

07:33.360 --> 07:36.960
 Then maybe you get done with that. And now you go at an airborne division. Now you're an even tighter

07:36.960 --> 07:42.720
 group because you've suffered together. What comes next is special forces training or ranger training.

07:42.720 --> 07:47.600
 And what they do is they put you in these situations where you're going to suffer together and you're

07:47.600 --> 07:51.520
 going to build these bonds because as I said earlier, you have to rely on each other to survive.

07:52.480 --> 07:55.600
 And by the way, not everyone does, not everyone makes it through this training. So you sort of

07:55.600 --> 07:59.440
 have these memories of people that didn't make it. You share that connection as well.

07:59.440 --> 08:04.320
 And you can keep going down this road until you go into combat with a military unit and

08:04.320 --> 08:09.600
 military units that go through combat, have an even tighter bond. And the harder the combat that

08:09.600 --> 08:15.040
 they go through, the tighter the bond is going to be. So I think when you talk about what the

08:15.040 --> 08:25.360
 Soviet Union went through in World War II, there was a shared suffering to survive. And so the

08:25.360 --> 08:33.280
 entire nation has that common thread. And that's probably the thing that you sense or feel when you

08:33.280 --> 08:39.120
 refer back to the bond that resonates all the way back to World War II.

08:40.160 --> 08:47.040
 So in your podcast and your writing, you talk about some of the most fascinating things I listen

08:47.040 --> 08:56.240
 to you talk about in terms of military conflict is tactics and sort of the details of combat.

08:58.640 --> 09:05.120
 But allow me to stick on World War II for a second. There's a particular aspect to that war,

09:05.120 --> 09:11.680
 I don't know if you can speak to it, where twice the number of civilians died than military personnel.

09:11.680 --> 09:26.320
 So the Soviet Union, especially. My grandfather was a machine gunner in Ukraine as the Germans were

09:26.320 --> 09:32.240
 marching towards Moscow. There's this important push in 1941 where they were trying to get before

09:32.240 --> 09:38.560
 the winter to Moscow. And what Stalin was doing, he was trying to get to Moscow. He was trying to

09:38.560 --> 09:49.440
 get to Moscow. And what Stalin was doing is he was basically throwing bodies to slow the attack.

09:49.440 --> 09:55.360
 And what that meant is everybody understood that your job was, you have this heavy machine guns,

09:56.000 --> 10:01.120
 it's very, it's almost unreasonable to be able to be mobile in any kind of way with them.

10:01.120 --> 10:09.280
 So you're thrown at the front and you're just nonstop shooting and 95 plus percent of people

10:09.280 --> 10:15.440
 are just dead. All the soldiers are just dead. And then you just go back and back and you're trying

10:15.440 --> 10:20.720
 to protect as many civilians as you can throughout this whole process, but you don't. And so you have

10:20.720 --> 10:26.160
 millions of civilians that die along the way into this march. Is there something you could say about

10:26.160 --> 10:36.560
 this complete, perhaps it's naive of me to say, but a war that lacks tactics, that lacks strategy

10:37.760 --> 10:50.960
 and is purely about just no consideration of human life and just throwing bodies and bullets

10:50.960 --> 11:00.640
 into a mix together where millions die. And that in particular felt much less like conflict

11:01.680 --> 11:12.960
 and much more like torture or suffering. It didn't come off as torture only that interestingly

11:12.960 --> 11:20.160
 enough, as you probably know, my grandfather, including everybody else, volunteered. They were

11:20.160 --> 11:26.240
 proud to do this. They were proud to march to their death for country, for love of country.

11:27.920 --> 11:33.520
 But the question on the civilian side, when more civilians die, the military personnel,

11:33.520 --> 11:42.400
 what do you make of that? It's awful. It's awful when a soldier dies. It's awful when a civilian

11:42.400 --> 11:49.920
 dies. It's awful when 10 civilians or 10 soldiers. And it's even more awful when millions and millions

11:49.920 --> 11:57.760
 of soldiers and civilians die. I think it's safe to say that the Soviet Union was facing an

11:57.760 --> 12:09.200
 existential threat to their existence against the Nazis. So to not fight would be to die as well,

12:09.200 --> 12:13.520
 maybe die a death a few years later, maybe die a different way. But

12:13.520 --> 12:22.480
 the choice was die now, trying or die later on your knees. And I think the choice was pretty clear.

12:23.120 --> 12:30.400
 As far as the tactics go, I mean, there is this is attrition warfare. That's what that is. We are

12:30.400 --> 12:36.720
 going to keep, you know, you said throwing bodies at the problem. That's attrition warfare. And the

12:36.720 --> 12:43.440
 Soviet Union had a lot of bodies, more than the Germans. And when you fight with attrition warfare,

12:43.440 --> 12:51.920
 whoever has more men and material will eventually win. It's an awful, it's an awful way. But that's

12:51.920 --> 12:57.840
 the that's that's what the strategy was. You often talk about leadership.

12:57.840 --> 13:06.240
 Let's put the evils of Hitler aside. The boldness of Hitler in making some of the strategic

13:06.240 --> 13:12.640
 decisions he did was considered by many military historians quite brilliant, early in the war,

13:13.840 --> 13:21.760
 or insane and brilliant. Stalin, on the other hand, I think university is seen as somebody who is

13:21.760 --> 13:29.200
 terrible military strategist, especially early in the war. He did not see all the possible

13:29.200 --> 13:34.000
 trajectories that the war could take. Is there something you could say about failure of leadership,

13:34.000 --> 13:41.760
 Stalin, also the United Kingdom before Churchill, and also FDR on the United States side, who

13:41.760 --> 13:47.360
 basically, was trying to turn a blind eye to everything that was happening over over there,

13:49.360 --> 13:54.240
 with a perspective of we just want to make, we want to keep America's interest

13:55.760 --> 14:00.240
 as the primary interest and everything else, let other countries work out their problems.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.680
 You know, I think one of the things with Hitler was in the beginning of the war,

14:03.680 --> 14:09.280
 he listened to his friends, his family, and he listened to his friends. He listened to

14:09.280 --> 14:15.280
 his generals. And therefore, they did pretty well with that. I think as the war went on,

14:15.280 --> 14:25.680
 he believed that he was smarter than he was, and made decisions that were bad, that cost him dearly.

14:26.400 --> 14:31.360
 You know, I mean, case in point, as everyone knows, going and attacking the Soviet Union,

14:31.360 --> 14:34.160
 while you're still fighting a war on the other front is not not a good move.

14:34.160 --> 14:38.960
 There's an example of yeah, bad leadership, letting your ego get in the way believing that you can do

14:38.960 --> 14:45.360
 things that you that are beyond your capabilities. But, you know, as you mentioned in the beginning

14:45.360 --> 14:53.680
 with Blitzkrieg, those were really dynamic and bold moves. And they worked. And that what does

14:53.680 --> 14:57.920
 that do? That fuels your ego and makes you think that you can win.

14:57.920 --> 15:04.080
 Many people consider that war a just war. What do you think makes a just war?

15:05.600 --> 15:12.720
 I think you have the Nazis, and the Imperial Japanese trying to impose their will on other

15:12.720 --> 15:19.840
 nations and other peoples. And when that happens, I think on a grand scale, people look at that. And

15:19.840 --> 15:25.920
 believe it's just to step in and do something about it.

15:25.920 --> 15:28.240
 Is there some gray area here?

15:28.240 --> 15:31.200
 There's, there's nothing but gray area.

15:32.800 --> 15:36.320
 The United States has been involved in a lot of military conflict since then.

15:36.960 --> 15:43.200
 How do you draw the line to the gray area? What, what war should we engage in and not?

15:44.000 --> 15:48.480
 I know you don't get a lot of questions about that, but I think it's important that you

15:48.480 --> 15:54.160
 I know you don't get into politics much. But what the decision to go to war,

15:55.040 --> 15:58.640
 you have to look at the situation that you're going into. And you have to make sure that you have

16:00.560 --> 16:08.000
 the will to go to war. And the will to go to war means that you are willing to kill people.

16:09.120 --> 16:12.480
 And when I say people, I don't just mean enemy, because in war,

16:12.480 --> 16:17.280
 civilians are going to die, women and children are going to die. Every a lot of people are

16:17.280 --> 16:21.760
 going to die. And so you and you are going to kill them. Doesn't matter what kind of

16:21.760 --> 16:26.640
 smart munitions you have. Doesn't matter how disciplined your soldiers are. When you go into

16:26.640 --> 16:32.240
 a war, civilians are going to die and you have to understand that. And the other thing that

16:32.240 --> 16:42.240
 you have to understand is that your troops are also going to die. And it seems like sometimes

16:42.240 --> 16:45.360
 we're a little bit naive about the calculation of what that's going to look like.

16:45.360 --> 16:50.800
 And maybe we think, well, not that many civilians and maybe not that many of our our personnel are

16:50.800 --> 16:56.960
 going to die. And that's where you get into sticky situations. And, you know, another thing when you

16:56.960 --> 17:04.480
 were talking about the Soviet Union versus the Nazis, that's total war. That's what that is. And

17:04.480 --> 17:10.160
 we don't engage in that very often. It's total war. It's we will do absolutely anything to win.

17:10.160 --> 17:15.520
 And America doesn't fight like that very often. In fact, the last time we fought like that was

17:15.520 --> 17:21.920
 World War Two. We it was total war. We will do whatever it takes to up to and including

17:22.480 --> 17:29.120
 the atomic bomb to destroy the enemy. So those are the kind of things you need to think about

17:29.760 --> 17:33.280
 before you go to war. And I don't think we think about that very often.

17:33.280 --> 17:39.280
 I don't think we think about that very often. You know, even the United States, the atomic bomb,

17:40.000 --> 17:42.960
 nuclear weapons is an interesting one because there's a lot of

17:46.320 --> 17:51.360
 there's a lot of hesitation on that. There's a lot of critics of that decision as it was happening.

17:52.880 --> 17:57.040
 So even America, you could imagine other countries like Germany would not be so hesitant

17:57.040 --> 18:08.960
 to use nuclear weapons. It's interesting to think about in deciding military strategy to inject

18:08.960 --> 18:16.240
 ethics into it, into morality. It's not just about winning the war, but should we do this

18:17.040 --> 18:23.600
 and doing the calculation of human life. Usually those decisions are made by leaders,

18:23.600 --> 18:29.040
 not by the soldier that's going to be implementing

18:30.720 --> 18:38.240
 that decision. Do you put some responsibility, I should even say blame on the leaders

18:38.880 --> 18:43.840
 and not doing that kind of calculation here? You could say that about the Vietnam War,

18:43.840 --> 18:47.520
 you could say that about even the war that you were involved with in Iraq.

18:47.520 --> 18:52.960
 Is there some criticism here that you could apply to leaders for failing not to consider

18:52.960 --> 18:56.720
 that the broader moral questions? Yes.

19:00.080 --> 19:07.120
 Natural, like all leaders will make these mistakes or should leaders not make these mistakes?

19:09.840 --> 19:13.600
 Leaders are going to make mistakes. It's impossible to know what's going to happen in war,

19:13.600 --> 19:15.920
 just like it's impossible to know what's going to happen in life.

19:15.920 --> 19:23.920
 You make decisions based on the information that you have at the time and you will make mistakes.

19:23.920 --> 19:29.760
 If you fail to admit that you made a mistake, that's where I have a more significant problem

19:30.480 --> 19:36.080
 than someone that makes a mistake and says, hey, this is the mistake that I made. This is the

19:36.080 --> 19:42.320
 intelligence that I thought we were utilizing and it actually is not what I thought it was going to

19:42.320 --> 19:51.280
 be. And here's the new direction that we're going in. We don't have enough of that type of ownership

19:52.080 --> 19:57.920
 in leadership globally. Just saying I made a mistake

20:00.480 --> 20:05.280
 that resulted in a loss at scale of human life, being able to say that.

20:05.280 --> 20:12.320
 Being able to say that. And when you don't say that, you end up with a more loss of human life.

20:13.840 --> 20:20.240
 Can I ask you about the loss of human life? How does killing a human being change you?

20:23.840 --> 20:27.920
 What does it mean to kill a human being? What does it feel like to kill a human being?

20:27.920 --> 20:32.480
 Well, I mean, I guess you'd have to look at what circumstances a person's in when this is taking

20:32.480 --> 20:38.320
 place. If you've got someone that's in a, a fit of rage that goes and kills somebody,

20:40.080 --> 20:43.920
 you know, they're going to come out of it and think, wow, I've just really messed up.

20:44.880 --> 20:53.120
 If you've got a, someone that is a sociopath, right? They're not going to feel anything.

20:53.120 --> 21:00.240
 And that person deserved to die. And that's why they died. If you've got a soldier who feels like

21:00.240 --> 21:09.120
 they're trying to protect their friends, they'll move through that. If you've got a soldier that's

21:09.120 --> 21:15.840
 doing it because they want some kind of personal glory, they'll probably not feel good about it

21:15.840 --> 21:20.960
 later. So I think it depends on the situation. I think it depends on the psychology of the

21:20.960 --> 21:26.240
 individual that's going through it. He said, move through that.

21:28.960 --> 21:35.840
 Is there some calculation here that a soldier, when they kill another soldier,

21:37.120 --> 21:39.920
 a realization that is just another human being,

21:39.920 --> 21:48.240
 I mean, is there some heavy burden to that aspect that it's ultimately just human on human?

21:51.280 --> 21:55.280
 I think it depends a lot on the scenario. I know that when I was in Iraq fighting,

21:56.400 --> 22:02.800
 we, we talk a lot about the dehumanization of the enemy and it's something that the

22:02.800 --> 22:09.280
 governments will do. I mean, governments will do that to each other. I mean, the Japanese dehumanized

22:09.280 --> 22:15.680
 the Americans and the Americans dehumanized the Japanese and the Americans dehumanized the Nazis

22:15.680 --> 22:21.440
 and the Nazis dehumanized the Americans so that to remove as much of that human on human killing

22:22.560 --> 22:27.280
 aspect that you're talking about. And what I would say is that the Japanese

22:27.280 --> 22:34.160
 human killing aspect that you're talking about. And what I, what I've said is that

22:35.200 --> 22:40.240
 in, when we were in Iraq, we didn't have to dehumanize the enemy because the,

22:40.240 --> 22:45.040
 the enemy dehumanized themselves through their actions, through their behaviors.

22:45.840 --> 22:52.480
 When, when we know that they are torturing and raping and murdering the local populace,

22:52.480 --> 22:57.920
 they've been dehumanized. And so as far as looking at them and thinking, oh, this is a,

22:57.920 --> 23:06.880
 you know, a human, another human that's, that's on the level of, you know, my, my uncle or my brother,

23:07.840 --> 23:11.040
 I didn't, I didn't think of them out that way. I thought of them as,

23:11.040 --> 23:19.920
 as murdering, raping, evil, subhumans.

23:21.120 --> 23:25.200
 Yeah. Rock is different and America's position is different. You're right. That America has not

23:25.200 --> 23:33.120
 been involved in a war where it's quite like two humans fighting, like teenage boys fighting

23:33.120 --> 23:36.400
 against each other. And you've got to remember that America

23:36.400 --> 23:42.000
 has not been involved in a war where it's quite like two humans fighting, like teenage boys fighting

23:42.000 --> 23:48.720
 against each other. And you've got to remember, I mean, we're, we're seeing these Iraqi kids

23:48.720 --> 23:58.240
 that are living under this sadistic, sadistic terror, the Iraqi women that are being raped

23:58.240 --> 24:06.480
 and so on the one side we become the, the Iraqi populace is very humanized to us because we're

24:06.480 --> 24:11.200
 talking to them. We've got interpreters, we understand we're seeing them day after day,

24:11.200 --> 24:19.120
 the same individuals. And so we form a bond with the local populace and yet we see what the

24:19.120 --> 24:26.000
 insurgents are doing. And so it's again, not difficult to dehumanize people that behave in

24:26.000 --> 24:34.560
 that manner. Yeah. I suppose I'm, I worry about the dehumanization at a much larger scale when

24:34.560 --> 24:43.120
 it's not the kind of case that you're talking about. Even now, hopefully I'm not fear mongering,

24:43.760 --> 24:50.480
 but there's a sense in which there's the drums of war slowly starting to build with China.

24:50.480 --> 25:01.200
 There, in the best case, it would be a cold war of, there's a dehumanization aspect that's

25:01.200 --> 25:07.600
 happening with China currently, which is they're the other and they're after stealing all of your

25:07.600 --> 25:14.160
 data. There's a cybersecurity, it starts with cybersecurity and it worries me because it

25:14.160 --> 25:24.160
 creates the other out of a very large population that may ultimately lead to conflict.

25:25.600 --> 25:31.280
 In the worst case, hot conflict that would no longer be the situation you are in in Iraq

25:31.840 --> 25:41.840
 and more similar to the Soviet Union conflict with Germany that it's kids and then they're

25:41.840 --> 25:50.080
 dehumanized to where you're at scale slaughtering them or at least hurting their quality of life

25:50.080 --> 25:55.920
 in a way that's maybe, you know, suffering has many forms. It doesn't have to be through just

25:55.920 --> 26:02.480
 a hot war. It could be through starvation, through camps, all those kinds of things.

26:02.480 --> 26:07.280
 And I worry about that. We kind of tend to think that these wars are behind us

26:07.280 --> 26:14.480
 and I'm not always so sure that's the case. And at least in the way that, it ultimately starts

26:14.480 --> 26:22.640
 with hate and it, again, hopefully I'm not being too dramatic, but I see that there's a kind of

26:22.640 --> 26:29.520
 brewing of, it starts with dehumanization that turns to hate of the other. You see that with

26:29.520 --> 26:36.240
 China, you see it a little bit with Russia and you have an early podcast with between the

26:36.240 --> 26:42.160
 where you break down the tactics of the Chechen war versus Russia. It's fascinating. But that's

26:42.160 --> 26:50.800
 the kind of conflicts I'm referring to. And I don't know. There's a, I know you're a bit of

26:50.800 --> 26:56.640
 a musician. I love, I love Dire Straits song called Brothers in Arms. I don't know if you

26:56.640 --> 27:04.400
 know that one. And there's a line in it. I think they play it quite often at military funerals,

27:04.400 --> 27:09.280
 which I just recently learned, but it's this powerful song that has a line, we're fools to

27:09.280 --> 27:16.720
 make war on our brothers in arms. Do you think there's some sense in which at the leadership

27:16.720 --> 27:25.360
 level, but just as human beings, we're perhaps foolish and engaging in military conflict

27:25.360 --> 27:32.080
 as much as we have, or as fool, a very inappropriate word here.

27:33.200 --> 27:38.800
 Well, I think that using the term brothers in arms means the people that are on my side,

27:38.800 --> 27:46.080
 right? So it doesn't make sense to start wars with people that are on your side. So that's,

27:46.080 --> 27:50.240
 that might just be the way the lyrics are written so that it fit the song or whatever.

27:50.240 --> 27:57.680
 I think broadly what you're asking me is, is war foolish? Yeah. And I would say the answer is yes.

27:57.680 --> 28:08.240
 And if you can avoid it, you absolutely should. But if there is a bear or a wolf that is trying

28:08.240 --> 28:15.760
 to get into your house, is it foolish to shoot that bear or shoot that wolf? I think that's

28:15.760 --> 28:22.480
 the answer. Is it foolish to shoot that bear or shoot that wolf? I think the answer is pretty

28:22.480 --> 28:29.040
 obvious. So when you're threatened or your family are threatened or your way of life is threatened,

28:29.040 --> 28:36.640
 then you have to do something to try and defend your family, your way of life. It should be the

28:36.640 --> 28:46.240
 last resort. You had a conversation with Jordan Peterson where he asked you a question

28:49.520 --> 28:55.760
 in terms of war being the last resort, whether you would like your kids to grow up in peace

28:55.760 --> 29:06.480
 in a time of no war. You said yes, but, and so happens Jordan didn't let you finish. Can you,

29:06.480 --> 29:12.720
 can you elaborate what follows the but? Well, you, you and I have been talking about the fact that

29:12.720 --> 29:18.560
 struggle brings people together and, and brings out the best and, and the worst, brings out the

29:18.560 --> 29:22.240
 worst in people. War brings out the worst in people. It also brings out the best in people.

29:22.240 --> 29:31.280
 So would you want your kid to go and enter in a wrestling tournament where

29:32.960 --> 29:43.040
 you paid all the other kids off and your kid won? Or you enter them in a jujitsu tournament where

29:43.040 --> 29:47.600
 they're a purple belt and you know that everyone that they're going to fight against is a white

29:47.600 --> 29:52.800
 belt. And so they get the, they get the big W, they get the win, but they don't really get tested

29:53.520 --> 30:00.080
 and they don't really struggle. And if you don't struggle, you don't grow. So that's the, but

30:00.080 --> 30:13.920
 right. Um, the, the absolute best times of my life were in combat and the worst times of my life were

30:13.920 --> 30:19.920
 in combat. And so even though I wouldn't want any of my children to suffer through the worst of times

30:21.600 --> 30:28.160
 at the same time, the but is I would want them to have the opportunity to feel that bond that

30:28.160 --> 30:35.120
 you're referring to earlier and to see human beings that are willing to sacrifice their

30:35.120 --> 30:42.400
 lives for their friends. You mentioned the worst. What are some of the worst aspects of

30:42.400 --> 30:54.240
 when you were in Iraq? Well, what are the things that, um, the hardest on you having my guys killed?

30:56.240 --> 31:07.040
 Is there, uh, absurd cruelty to it? Was it due to mistakes or natural consequences of, of fighting?

31:07.040 --> 31:12.640
 Is there any difference? Is that at the end is just losing? Those are brothers in arms.

31:13.280 --> 31:17.680
 There's a million different ways to get killed in the war and you can go out on an operation and you

31:17.680 --> 31:23.680
 can do everything wrong and you can survive and you can go out in an operation and do everything

31:23.680 --> 31:30.400
 perfect and you can get killed. Is there some aspect which makes it worse when there is mistakes

31:30.400 --> 31:36.800
 made? Well, yeah, if there's mistakes made, then you're going to sit there and beat yourself up

31:36.800 --> 31:43.680
 eternally for mistakes that were made. But to you, the things that hurt is just losing,

31:44.400 --> 31:52.080
 losing people close to you. Yes. Are you yourself afraid of death? No.

31:52.080 --> 32:00.960
 Are you yourself afraid of death? No. Do you think about it? Does it make sense to you that this

32:00.960 --> 32:09.040
 thing ends? Like do you, uh, the Stoics contemplated death. It gives flavor to life.

32:09.040 --> 32:14.640
 It makes you appreciate, there's something about finiteness of life that makes it, that makes it

32:14.640 --> 32:23.920
 this, uh, Jocko Discipline Go drink, sour apple that I'm enjoying is delicious. Makes it taste

32:23.920 --> 32:29.760
 better because I'm going to die one day. And I think about that a lot. Do you think about it?

32:32.880 --> 32:39.040
 Other than I know that it's going to end. I mean, but I don't think about it on a daily basis. I

32:39.040 --> 32:45.840
 think about the fact I think about, I know that I'm lucky to be here. I know that many people

32:45.840 --> 32:52.960
 sacrificed to give me this opportunity to be here. So, but I don't dwell on it.

32:56.720 --> 33:01.280
 What about when you were in combat? Nothing. There's, there's tactics,

33:01.280 --> 33:09.120
 there's strategy, there's the mission. And then your mortality is not part of the calculation.

33:10.080 --> 33:16.320
 I think you get to a point where you accept the fact that you can die. Like I, I, you know,

33:16.320 --> 33:20.800
 like I said, you can do everything right. You roll out the gate, you hit an ID, a triple stack

33:20.800 --> 33:25.200
 subsurface ID and you're dead. You're done. And there's nothing that's going to stop that. It's

33:25.200 --> 33:30.480
 going to happen. And I think if you're scared of that or you're thinking about that, it's going to

33:30.480 --> 33:35.440
 inhibit your ability to do your job properly. And I think it's also going to drive you crazy.

33:36.400 --> 33:42.640
 The thing that I thought about more was that happening to my guys. And that's the gut wrenching

33:42.640 --> 33:52.400
 terror that you feel when, when operations happen. Can I ask you about love of country? It's, it

33:52.400 --> 34:01.680
 continues to just how much I've studied Stalin recently in the past few years. It continues to

34:01.680 --> 34:09.680
 surprise me, not surprise me. It's just tragic in some kind of way. I'm not sure exactly if I could

34:09.680 --> 34:16.720
 put words to it, but how many people and still do, but at the time were willing, loved Stalin

34:16.720 --> 34:25.200
 and were willing to die for country for the love of country. And I too, maybe because I was born

34:25.200 --> 34:36.560
 there and now I am a red blooded American. I love nationalism is a bad word, but I love the love of

34:36.560 --> 34:43.920
 country. It gives, it somehow gives a meaning like a brotherhood, like we're in this together.

34:43.920 --> 34:56.560
 I love that's why I love the Olympics. That's just the, the unity of it. It takes a step out of the

34:56.560 --> 35:04.000
 selfish pursuits of any one particular ant and looks at us as a big ant colony and it's inspiring.

35:04.000 --> 35:11.200
 It's it's exciting, but at the same time, it seems to get us to do horrible things.

35:11.200 --> 35:20.480
 If, if manipulated by charismatic leaders, what do you make of this love of country? Is it a,

35:20.480 --> 35:25.520
 is it a bad thing? Is it a thing that gets in the way or is it a good thing?

35:26.160 --> 35:30.560
 Well, I think like anything else, if it's balanced correctly,

35:30.560 --> 35:35.440
 it's great. And if it goes to some extreme level, then it becomes a negative.

35:35.440 --> 35:43.200
 And I think it, I think it's probably sourced in some sort of animalistic tribalism that we all

35:43.200 --> 35:49.440
 have to be part of a tribe. And this is a real big tribe that you get to be a part of. And all

35:49.440 --> 35:54.400
 you have to do is kind of show up. And so when someone says, Hey, we're going to play hockey

35:54.400 --> 36:00.720
 against the Russians, well, we're going to cheer for the American boys.

36:00.720 --> 36:08.720
 So my, my area of work is artificial intelligence. It'd be interesting to ask your thoughts about

36:08.720 --> 36:17.600
 something, which is autonomous weapon systems. US has now officially released the report saying

36:17.600 --> 36:25.520
 that they're open to, not open, they're engaging in, in adding more and more autonomy and artificial

36:25.520 --> 36:31.040
 intelligence into its weapon systems because China is doing it. So there's, these are the first steps

36:31.040 --> 36:41.120
 in something that AI folks worry about, which is a race, an AI race in the space of autonomous

36:41.120 --> 36:48.240
 weapons that can run away too quickly. Is that something, I don't know if in general,

36:48.240 --> 36:53.360
 if you have thoughts about weapon systems that make autonomous decisions

36:53.360 --> 36:59.760
 at the small scale of just targeting where to shoot and at the largest scale of military strategy

37:00.320 --> 37:07.280
 of just being given a mission of destroy this particular target, this particular, say terrorist

37:07.600 --> 37:13.760
 human being, and then figure out what is the right bombing campaign on your own to accomplish

37:13.760 --> 37:20.400
 this task that minimizes civilian death. And then just loading that in and letting the AI system

37:20.400 --> 37:27.280
 automatically decide that. What are your general thoughts about it? Do you, do you worry about it?

37:27.280 --> 37:34.640
 Because there's the positive effects that in the best version of that world, you kill fewer

37:34.640 --> 37:43.440
 civilians, you kill, hurt fewer of your own human beings. But at the negative side of that,

37:43.440 --> 37:51.360
 you might lose the thing we kind of talked about, which is the basic humanity, even in the individual

37:51.360 --> 37:58.800
 soldier of what is right and what is wrong and not making huge mistakes that hurt thousands

37:58.800 --> 38:04.560
 or millions of people. I guess what you're asking me is if they could make a machine that could

38:04.560 --> 38:13.200
 do more surgical attacks on enemy individuals, would I be for it? Yes, I would be for it.

38:14.160 --> 38:23.280
 The problem is if you've ever used machines of any kind, their initial design may not be,

38:23.280 --> 38:32.160
 there's unintended consequences. There's ways in the machine actually behaves that you realize

38:32.160 --> 38:38.640
 there's bugs in this thing. So do we not put protocols in place to prevent something from

38:38.640 --> 38:44.400
 going too far outside the boundaries of what we wanted to execute? You do. But the question is,

38:45.440 --> 38:53.200
 this is the first time in human history you can create things, machines, toaster, microwave oven,

38:53.200 --> 39:00.320
 that's smarter than you in this particular task. I mean, it's not yet there. What you're learning a

39:00.320 --> 39:06.640
 lot with military strategies, humans are actually really damn smart. It's very hard to improve on a

39:06.640 --> 39:13.680
 human. And so most actual drones that are unmanned are still piloted by humans. It's very difficult

39:13.680 --> 39:25.680
 to do every aspect of war. But it's not out of the realm of possibility that machines will start

39:25.680 --> 39:33.120
 doing those things better in certain things, certain more precise targeting of the enemy.

39:35.360 --> 39:42.080
 The question is, so what happens when you start to rely on the machine to do some of the task

39:42.080 --> 39:51.280
 is you get lazy. You forget what it is like to do that task or more importantly, you lose the

39:51.280 --> 39:57.520
 knowledge of the intricacies of that task and you forget the ways it can go wrong. So the protocols

39:57.520 --> 40:05.800
 may not be sufficient to constrain the power of the ways that things go wrong, especially when

40:05.800 --> 40:12.800
 things are moving really quickly, especially when the ethics of the two sides aren't perfectly

40:12.800 --> 40:19.520
 aligned. When people are some certain sides, like on the Chinese side, may be more willing to take

40:19.520 --> 40:26.880
 risks for dangerous consequences than others. So what happened on the bioweapon side

40:27.520 --> 40:32.400
 is internationally, maybe you can speak to this more, but my sense, what I was told,

40:32.400 --> 40:40.240
 there is a sense globally that bioweapons are not going to be used. They're unethical. There's a

40:40.240 --> 40:49.560
 sense like we're not going to engage in this. And with AI currently, China and US said, green light,

40:49.560 --> 40:59.160
 all go ahead. It's totally ethical. If it can decrease the loss of human life, why not?

40:59.160 --> 41:12.840
 And my worry is that it's much easier to design weapons that are effective than design weapons

41:12.840 --> 41:21.120
 who have the depth of ethics and morals that humans do, which I think we don't as human

41:21.120 --> 41:26.400
 beings don't acknowledge enough that even like the cold calculated killing of others,

41:26.400 --> 41:35.280
 like precise, effective execution of a mission still has ethics in it. At every level, you know

41:35.280 --> 41:40.520
 what's right and what's wrong. And I don't know if you take that away, you're not going to make

41:40.520 --> 41:48.480
 huge mistakes that you regret. Is that something you don't worry about?

41:48.480 --> 41:56.120
 I don't really worry about it. But as you design something, like I said, you put protocols in place

41:56.120 --> 42:01.640
 and from what I am hearing you say, or trying to hear you say, there's be a point where our

42:01.640 --> 42:10.040
 protocols wouldn't be sufficient to stop the machine from doing something that was unethical.

42:10.040 --> 42:20.560
 I'm kind of worried that this is something you don't worry about. Because a lot of people I

42:20.560 --> 42:25.880
 respect don't worry about it. And I don't know what to do about that. A lot of generals don't

42:25.880 --> 42:32.840
 worry about it. A lot of people who know much more about war, like you than me, don't worry about it.

42:32.840 --> 42:34.120
 And that worries me.

42:34.120 --> 42:42.480
 Well, that's because you have a vision into the shortfalls of AI. And I don't. I don't have a

42:42.480 --> 42:47.640
 vision of the shortfalls of AI. I don't know enough about it. As far as I'm concerned, you put

42:47.640 --> 42:55.720
 a on off switch somewhere, you put a kill switch on a system. And if it starts going awry, you hit

42:55.720 --> 43:00.920
 the kill switch, and that's it. So if you know, when you look at me and say, well, there's no

43:00.920 --> 43:05.640
 possible way to put a kill switch, that would be 100% effective. And here's, you draw those concerns

43:05.640 --> 43:10.800
 to me. And we could talk through it and say, okay, well, here's where we should draw the line.

43:10.800 --> 43:11.240
 Yeah.

43:11.240 --> 43:18.840
 I mean, it's like, again, for the Soviet Union, Chernobyl meltdown, there was always the ability,

43:18.840 --> 43:24.720
 I believe, to have a kill switch. The problem is, the more power you give to the machine,

43:24.720 --> 43:34.560
 the more opportunity you give to the human supervising that machine to make a mistake

43:34.560 --> 43:41.120
 and not shut off the switch at the right time. So yes, the solution, I mean, you're putting the

43:41.120 --> 43:44.840
 responsibility still in the human hands. And I think that's the correct place to put it. There

43:44.840 --> 43:50.320
 should be good protocols, good leadership, good execution, competency all around. Your

43:50.320 --> 43:55.800
 protocols should consider the basic failures of human nature, the human factor of how things go

43:55.800 --> 43:59.880
 wrong. So there should be multiple people supervising the system, all those things. But

43:59.880 --> 44:07.640
 I am just very skeptical of greater and greater power in the machine that can create war, that

44:07.640 --> 44:14.200
 cannot lead to death. Yeah. And that's why, like I said, and like you just said, you have protocols

44:14.200 --> 44:19.520
 in place that are a kill switch. And if you think about the amount of nuclear weapons that we've had

44:19.520 --> 44:29.120
 on planet Earth for the past however many years, and there's been no rogue element that said,

44:29.120 --> 44:33.160
 you know what, I'm going to shoot this thing. There's been no protocol that took place where

44:33.160 --> 44:40.800
 all of a sudden we said, oh no. I mean, there's been escalations, but the protocols worked,

44:40.800 --> 44:47.480
 have worked so far. Now, that's a scary thing to think about, that we rely on these protocols to

44:47.480 --> 44:54.080
 stop some rogue element out there from launching a missile that could kill millions of people and

44:54.080 --> 45:04.280
 trigger a global war. So yeah, the protocols should be strict. Okay. Can I ask a Jack O Wonka

45:04.280 --> 45:11.200
 ridiculous question? If human civilization goes extinct, what would be the reason? You mentioned

45:11.200 --> 45:17.400
 nuclear war. Do you worry about this? The reason I bring that up, a lot of people in the

45:17.400 --> 45:23.240
 AI community worry about artificial general intelligence. So super intelligent AI systems

45:23.240 --> 45:28.600
 creating a lot of damage. Autonomous weapon systems is one possibility. A lot of folks

45:28.600 --> 45:34.960
 recently, especially with this pandemic, if you want to be terrified, listen, somebody I talked

45:34.960 --> 45:43.120
 to recently, Sam Harris, he did a four hour podcast on how bioengineering of viruses is likely

45:43.120 --> 45:48.880
 to destroy human civilization. I recommend that highly if you were too optimistic about the

45:48.880 --> 45:55.080
 future of the human species. So apparently in the space of bioengineering is becoming easier and

45:55.080 --> 46:06.880
 easier and easier to engineer viruses, engineer pathogens. This is the world's most depressing

46:06.880 --> 46:13.600
 question. Is there something in particular you worry about? Like that we should be thinking as

46:13.600 --> 46:21.640
 a human species about? Yeah, I'm sorry to disappoint you again with my lack of worry for all these

46:21.640 --> 46:30.840
 problems, but I don't worry too much about it. You know what? We've made it through a bunch of

46:30.840 --> 46:37.320
 wickets so far as a species and we'll make it through some more or we won't. And if we don't

46:37.320 --> 46:41.760
 make it through some of these wickets and someone decides that what they're going to do over the

46:41.760 --> 46:49.400
 weekend is create some crazy virus that spreads and kills everybody. Yeah. You know what? I'm

46:49.400 --> 46:57.360
 usually extremely optimistic about this stuff. I am now I'm with you except we won't. Well,

46:57.360 --> 47:03.960
 there's always a chance we won't, but I have a sense that human, first of all, I believe that

47:03.960 --> 47:08.960
 most people have much more capacity for good than evil. All of us are capable of evil, I believe,

47:08.960 --> 47:17.200
 but most people are much more capable of doing good and want to do good. And I also believe in

47:17.200 --> 47:22.960
 the resiliency of the human species that we're an innovative bunch and we can respond to tragedy,

47:22.960 --> 47:28.720
 especially we respond more to tragedy as the scale of tragedy grows and our response is much

47:28.720 --> 47:39.960
 better. So that's why I'm not worried about it, bro. What makes a great man? Let's start at the

47:39.960 --> 47:44.560
 individual. What makes a great man? What makes a great woman? What makes a great human being?

47:44.560 --> 47:52.360
 Somebody that puts others above themselves. What makes a great leader of humans?

47:52.360 --> 47:53.800
 Same thing.

47:53.800 --> 48:01.560
 But that sentence does a lot of work. When you're a leader, there's a lot of egos. There's a lot

48:01.560 --> 48:07.560
 of tension. There's the human factor. There's people who are timid. There's people who are

48:07.560 --> 48:14.720
 assholes. There's people who are incredibly competent, but self obsessed. I don't know.

48:14.720 --> 48:22.200
 There's complexities of human nature. How do you get all those people to be the best version of

48:22.200 --> 48:25.080
 themselves and to lift up everyone else around them?

48:25.080 --> 48:31.240
 Okay. So now that, that question is a little bit different now. So now it's getting into a more

48:31.240 --> 48:36.120
 specific question, but at the same time, a more broad question of what elements does it take to

48:36.120 --> 48:41.720
 make a good leader? So you're right that different people have different personalities, different

48:41.720 --> 48:51.360
 tendencies, different levels of ego. And the, the way that I try and explain this is like a

48:51.360 --> 48:55.720
 video game. And I'm not even a video game player, but I've seen this before where video game

48:55.720 --> 49:02.920
 characters have various skills, various strengths and weaknesses. So maybe they're strong, but

49:02.920 --> 49:07.240
 they're dumb, or maybe they're strong and smart, but they're slow. They just give them these,

49:07.240 --> 49:11.800
 these ratings. And so that's where human beings are. And that's the way leaders are. And you can

49:11.800 --> 49:17.480
 have different leaders with different characteristics. And depending on how all those

49:17.480 --> 49:25.640
 characteristics match up, you can have somebody that is very introverted, but they're a, but,

49:25.640 --> 49:31.640
 but they're still a very good leader because when they do communicate, they do it in a clear,

49:31.640 --> 49:34.840
 simple manner that everyone understands. So even though they're a little bit introverted,

49:34.840 --> 49:39.640
 people still respect them and listen to them because they communicate in a clear way.

49:39.640 --> 49:47.480
 You could have somebody that's extremely charismatic, extremely charismatic and everyone

49:47.480 --> 49:53.640
 looks to them, but they're slow in making decisions. And so now we've got someone that

49:53.640 --> 49:57.240
 can't really make decisions when decisions need to get made. So even though they're

49:57.240 --> 50:03.160
 charismatic, they're still not a good leader. So depending on the human being that we're talking

50:03.160 --> 50:07.800
 about, and you just mentioned earlier that human beings are, you know, more complex than anything

50:07.800 --> 50:12.840
 and do a better job at just about everything than a robot. So that's the same thing with

50:12.840 --> 50:16.040
 leadership. You've got all these different characteristics and you, you match them or mix

50:16.040 --> 50:23.240
 them together. And depending on where the ratings come out, depending on how that thing does in the

50:23.240 --> 50:29.000
 end, can we almost like as a case study, look at a few people in the tech area that I'm familiar

50:29.000 --> 50:35.400
 with that I know well, we can, the only caveat being that I may have no familiarization with

50:35.400 --> 50:40.520
 them whatsoever. You may have to brief me on them. Yeah. So I'll do my best to brief. I'll do my best

50:40.520 --> 50:46.360
 to reduce human beings into simple descriptions. And then you can give me insights of why the hell

50:46.360 --> 50:50.920
 they're such effective leaders based on my description, not based on your actual deep

50:50.920 --> 50:58.120
 knowledge of the human beings. So that caveat of my inability to speak both the English language

50:58.120 --> 51:06.120
 and describe humans well. Let's talk about first, Elon Musk. So he's known as being quite

51:07.000 --> 51:11.880
 harsh in the sense of, first of all, a very high bar of excellence.

51:13.800 --> 51:19.640
 And also willing to what he calls that kind of first principles thinking of asking the,

51:20.840 --> 51:26.600
 the questions that hurt, which is why the hell are we doing it this way?

51:26.600 --> 51:31.160
 Why can't it be done a lot, but not just better, but a lot better. So, so let's,

51:33.160 --> 51:36.520
 I don't want to hear his whole character. I'll go one at one section at a time. So we've got a guy

51:36.520 --> 51:44.440
 that's harsh and, and asking the really hard questions. How can that be good? Or why is that

51:44.440 --> 51:49.320
 good? Well, first of all, it can be horrible. And there's leaders out there that are harsh and

51:49.320 --> 51:52.360
 they're hated and no one likes them and no one wants to work for them and they never do anything.

51:52.360 --> 51:59.640
 So what is it that Elon Musk does that makes, gives him the ability to be harsh? So I was, I was

52:01.160 --> 52:10.360
 hearing a description of me when I would give feedback to young seals that had made mistakes

52:10.360 --> 52:18.440
 during training operations. And the description was that I, same thing, like this harsh blunt force

52:18.440 --> 52:29.000
 trauma and just totally direct sledgehammer of truth that I would hit guys with. But it's

52:29.000 --> 52:32.760
 interesting because I always talk about, you know, building relationships and making sure you're not

52:32.760 --> 52:37.800
 offending someone. Yeah. So how do these things match up? Well, I can tell you how they match up

52:38.600 --> 52:46.280
 when I was being harsh, the guys that I was being harsh with knew without one shred of doubt that

52:46.280 --> 52:50.120
 I cared about them more than anything else. And that the reason I was giving them this feedback

52:50.120 --> 52:53.960
 is because I wanted them to be able to lead their troops. I wanted them to be able to go

52:53.960 --> 52:58.120
 accomplish their mission. And I wanted them to be able to bring their guys home from war.

52:59.400 --> 53:04.360
 So I wasn't being harsh because it elevated my ego. I wasn't being harsh because I wanted to

53:04.360 --> 53:08.760
 denigrate them. I was being, actually being harsh because I wanted them to accomplish the mission.

53:08.760 --> 53:15.240
 Because I wanted them to accomplish the mission. So if that's where Elon comes from,

53:15.240 --> 53:20.040
 hey, listen, we got to make this happen. This is for the good of the world to do this.

53:20.760 --> 53:26.680
 And people know that then it works. I'll bring this point back up with another guy,

53:26.680 --> 53:34.600
 Steve Jobs, but let me stay on Elon for a second. The other thing he does, which is interesting,

53:34.600 --> 53:41.080
 I see the value of this. It'd be great to hear you speak about it. He's unlike many of the other

53:41.080 --> 53:52.120
 CEOs, very rich billionaires, involved in leading a lot of people. He puts a lot of time into making

53:52.120 --> 53:58.920
 sure he's on the factory floor. He famously sleeps on the, sort of like in the middle of things.

53:58.920 --> 54:05.800
 And he puts a lot of effort. He's also very good at it is being a low level engineer. So like,

54:05.800 --> 54:11.960
 whatever the task is, he wants to understand the details and he'll talk to the lowest level person

54:11.960 --> 54:19.640
 in terms of like, somebody who's like working literally on putting parts together. He wants to

54:19.640 --> 54:24.680
 understand what the problem is, what the challenge is. If there's an emergency, he wants to understand

54:24.680 --> 54:29.160
 the actual details of the problem, not like delegating it to a manager, but like,

54:29.880 --> 54:35.560
 because a lot of CEOs, a lot of managers will talk about sort of the power and the importance

54:35.560 --> 54:41.080
 of delegation. Here, he wants to know if there's a big problem, he wants to know the exact detail.

54:41.080 --> 54:46.040
 He wants to know the exact problem. He wants to, at the fundamental level, understand how to solve

54:46.040 --> 54:51.080
 that problem. Whether it has to do with materials, whether it has to do with the actual manufacturing,

54:51.080 --> 54:56.840
 the mechanical engineering aspect, like we're talking about engineering. This is a guy who

54:56.840 --> 55:05.720
 wears a suit as a CEO, tweets about Dogecoin, but like an actual job, he's low level engineering.

55:05.720 --> 55:12.680
 And that to me was always inspiring to see somebody who knows what the fuck they're doing.

55:12.680 --> 55:18.040
 That's what it, like he gains the respect of engineers at the lowest level.

55:18.040 --> 55:22.760
 I don't know if that's scalable, but that's always been inspiring to me. And I wonder how many people

55:22.760 --> 55:28.280
 it's inspiring to. Maybe you could speak to the value of doing that, of no matter how high your

55:28.280 --> 55:35.320
 level of leader is, to be able to do the low level shit. Yeah. And that's a common trait that good

55:35.320 --> 55:40.840
 leaders have. And maybe he doesn't necessarily know how to do everything, a good leader,

55:40.840 --> 55:45.400
 but they go down there and talk to the frontline troops and say, Hey, what is the issue that you're

55:45.400 --> 55:50.680
 dealing with? Or, you know, how can I support you? How can I give you help? And one key point that

55:50.680 --> 55:55.800
 you said is, he said, when there's a problem, he gets in there. So there's things happening

55:55.800 --> 56:01.560
 at his companies that they're working. And so he doesn't have to die. I'm not saying he never does,

56:01.560 --> 56:08.440
 but he doesn't have to spend as much time working on or looking at some subsystem that's functioning

56:08.440 --> 56:12.280
 well. He's got a good leader in there that's handling it. And he checks in with that leader.

56:12.280 --> 56:17.560
 And the leader says, yeah, it's working perfectly. He says, great. When there's a problem, that's

56:17.560 --> 56:21.640
 when he might have to get down there and dig into some details so that he fully understands it. So

56:21.640 --> 56:28.120
 that he, when he digs down in the details, and this is important, he's coming from an altitude

56:28.120 --> 56:33.560
 where he has a better, bigger perspective, not necessarily better, but a bigger perspective.

56:33.560 --> 56:39.240
 So if you sit there and work on a problem, whatever, for eight hours and you're staring

56:39.240 --> 56:43.560
 at, you know, if you were planning a mission and you were planning it for eight hours,

56:43.560 --> 56:47.080
 you're staring at the maps and the charts and you're figuring out where all the troops are

56:47.080 --> 56:53.320
 going to be located. And I come in after eight hours and I look at your plan from a distant

56:53.320 --> 56:57.960
 perspective, there's a good chance I'll be able to see holes in your plan that you couldn't see

56:57.960 --> 57:04.120
 because your perspective was too close. So that's good for me to be able to come in from a higher

57:04.120 --> 57:10.280
 perspective and have a look at it. But also there's times where I need to get down there and

57:10.280 --> 57:13.960
 actually look, you know, if you're looking at a problem and you say, look, I can't figure out

57:13.960 --> 57:17.880
 boss, I can't figure out how to get to this target. And I'm looking at it from a distance and

57:17.880 --> 57:22.840
 I don't see, I might need to start digging in and looking and saying, Oh, here's a route that we

57:22.840 --> 57:29.240
 can take that actually makes sense. Let's try that. So I think it's a good example of someone

57:29.240 --> 57:33.400
 going up and down in altitude to look at problems, understanding what's happening with the frontline

57:33.400 --> 57:39.400
 troops. And at the same time, being able to go back to the strategic level. And I can, it's

57:39.400 --> 57:44.840
 probably this way. The reason that he's successful is because he doesn't get stuck down there.

57:44.840 --> 57:49.480
 Yeah. Because if he felt the need to micromanage each and every part on a Tesla,

57:50.680 --> 57:55.160
 it wouldn't be, it would be very unlikely that he would have the capacity to do that.

57:55.160 --> 57:59.720
 It wouldn't be, it would be very unlikely that he would have the capacity to do all that.

58:00.600 --> 58:06.200
 Now he can hand over some broad chip design and say, Hey, this is what the function needs to be.

58:06.200 --> 58:09.080
 And he gives it to Lex and Lex goes there with your team and you figured out and you make it

58:09.080 --> 58:15.640
 happen. If he had to actually do that all himself, most likely not possible. So that's what leaders

58:15.640 --> 58:20.920
 should be doing. They should go elevate and, and, and then get down in the weeds when they have to,

58:20.920 --> 58:27.400
 and then go back up. The sad thing, this is the part that makes me not want to do a startup

58:28.760 --> 58:35.480
 is basically his whole life is dealing with emergencies. Just like you said, he's not

58:35.480 --> 58:41.800
 dealing, this is not shooting the shit about details of engineering. It's dealing with like,

58:42.440 --> 58:48.280
 in this, in the case of the company, life and death, like something that can just completely

58:48.280 --> 58:52.440
 damage the production line, right? So he's constantly dealing with emergencies, putting out

58:52.440 --> 58:57.880
 fires. And I don't know if there's something to be said about that psychology of that, of how,

58:59.160 --> 59:03.320
 like he, he's spoken himself that he's worried whether his mind can hold up much longer.

59:04.600 --> 59:10.680
 So hopefully in the near future, he will start to form more decentralized command where he has some

59:10.680 --> 59:16.360
 subordinate leadership that he fully trusts. And most important that he has properly trained

59:16.360 --> 59:22.520
 so that they can handle these day to day fires at least 80% of them. So only 20% of the time,

59:23.080 --> 59:28.360
 does he actually need to go in and solve a problem. If he's not doing that right now,

59:28.360 --> 59:32.760
 then that's going to end up being a problem anytime. So I work with companies all the time.

59:32.760 --> 59:37.000
 And that's, what's interesting about this is I go and work with a CEO or with a,

59:37.000 --> 59:41.400
 with a C suite of a company. It takes a little while to figure out what's going on. I'm kind of

59:41.400 --> 59:46.280
 going off of the things that you're telling me almost anecdotally, right? Yes. But let's

59:46.280 --> 59:52.040
 say that what you and also, I don't know how familiar you actually are with the inner workings

59:52.040 --> 59:59.240
 of his companies, but if we were to assume that what you're saying is accurate, then my advice

59:59.240 --> 1:00:04.040
 would be, Hey, listen, you need to start putting a little bit more time and effort into training up

1:00:04.040 --> 1:00:10.120
 some subordinate leadership that has the trust, knowledge, and expertise that you will be able

1:00:10.120 --> 1:00:16.040
 to turn over some of these, some of these details to for two reasons. Number one, so you can let

1:00:16.040 --> 1:00:21.800
 your brain, you know, you can, you can survive a little longer as he put it, but also all the

1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:25.800
 time that you spend as a leader, looking down and into your organization is time that you're

1:00:25.800 --> 1:00:29.800
 not looking up and out. So when you're not looking up and out, you're not seeing what

1:00:29.800 --> 1:00:33.560
 the competitors doing. You're not seeing where the market's going. There's problems that,

1:00:33.560 --> 1:00:38.200
 that, that can come from that. So if right now he's spending too much time looking down and in,

1:00:38.200 --> 1:00:40.840
 and you mentioned, you know, you said, I don't know if I want to do a startup. When you do a

1:00:40.840 --> 1:00:44.200
 startup, you're going to be looking down and in for a while. It's going to take a while. You're

1:00:44.200 --> 1:00:47.400
 going to have to do all this work yourself. You're not going to have the finances to put

1:00:47.400 --> 1:00:53.640
 people manpower behind these things. So that's probably he, maybe he's in that mindset a little

1:00:53.640 --> 1:00:58.840
 bit because he's done so many startups over the years. And so he's in the he's habitually in the

1:00:58.840 --> 1:01:04.760
 weeds. So my advice would be, all right, let's start looking at formulating some subordinate

1:01:04.760 --> 1:01:09.000
 leadership that has the, like I said, the expertise, the trust that you can, you can start

1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:15.000
 to turn over some of these more minute details to them so that you can start looking up and out.

1:01:15.560 --> 1:01:20.280
 Yeah. I think he's done that more successful in some places than others. The SpaceX, a lot of

1:01:20.280 --> 1:01:31.320
 people give the credit to Gwen Shotwell for the CEO, the COO of SpaceX as, as a very successful

1:01:31.320 --> 1:01:38.840
 person that runs shit, but in Tesla, not as much. So I wonder if you can comment on something

1:01:38.840 --> 1:01:46.120
 a lot of people worry about, and this applies to a lot of tech companies, which is a lot of people

1:01:46.120 --> 1:01:54.040
 worry about that if Elon disappears, the, the, the innovative spirit, the company is as we know them

1:01:54.040 --> 1:02:00.600
 today will collapse, will stagnate and will basically fail to do what they've been doing for

1:02:00.600 --> 1:02:09.400
 so many years successfully. Is there some aspect to what makes a good leader that if you disappear,

1:02:09.400 --> 1:02:13.880
 it's still the thing still lives on and not just lives on, but thrives.

1:02:14.520 --> 1:02:19.240
 Yeah. So what we have to do in those situations is we have to establish a strong culture inside

1:02:19.240 --> 1:02:26.680
 that organization. And if you're there's, there's, there's reasons why this happens, right? If I have

1:02:26.680 --> 1:02:32.200
 a big ego and I form a company and I love the fact that everyone looks at me and says, Oh,

1:02:32.200 --> 1:02:36.520
 Jocko made this company and he's the creative force behind this company. And that fuels my ego

1:02:36.520 --> 1:02:40.920
 and it makes me feel good. And you know, I'm working with you, Lex. And every time you come

1:02:40.920 --> 1:02:46.440
 up with an idea, I say, Lex, you need to stay in your box. Yeah. Right. So I'm not creating a culture

1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:54.040
 that rewards that sort of creativity. And eventually when I die, I won't have

1:02:54.040 --> 1:03:02.680
 have educated my team on how to maintain that creative aspect. So again, hopefully inside

1:03:02.680 --> 1:03:10.760
 that organization, he's, he's encouraging and growing that culture where creativity is rewarded,

1:03:10.760 --> 1:03:15.480
 where, where it flourishes, even when he's gone, that's what we have to hope for.

1:03:16.520 --> 1:03:21.240
 He is, but I also seem to notice that there's not many people like him.

1:03:21.240 --> 1:03:31.160
 Um, people become complacent too easily. I've been disappointed by people a little bit.

1:03:31.880 --> 1:03:39.880
 It's like, success makes people soft. With Elon, it seems like success doesn't have any effect.

1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:45.480
 It's like the reverse effect. It doesn't, it's like, what's the, it's always like,

1:03:45.480 --> 1:03:50.200
 what's the next biggest thing, right? He's living that exponential growth,

1:03:50.200 --> 1:03:55.400
 which I think that's the problem that you have to have somebody who's constantly

1:03:56.120 --> 1:04:00.440
 trying to find the 10 X solution, like trying to constantly improve things.

1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:06.120
 And, uh, restlessly that, I mean, that probably has to do with finding the right people,

1:04:06.120 --> 1:04:09.880
 not just creating the culture, but creating a culture with the right set of people.

1:04:11.320 --> 1:04:19.240
 Speaking of which Steve Jobs, there's, uh, two things I want to mention there.

1:04:19.240 --> 1:04:22.040
 One, once again, the harshness, but a very different kind.

1:04:22.840 --> 1:04:30.120
 And the second is team building. So on the harshness, he is much harsher than Elon

1:04:32.920 --> 1:04:38.040
 in a way, in the following way. And I'm having a sense that you will not like this,

1:04:38.040 --> 1:04:44.920
 but I'd like to defend it is he loses his shit quite a bit. He was famously, at least,

1:04:44.920 --> 1:04:51.320
 especially early on being very emotional. He was letting passion dominate the discussion.

1:04:51.320 --> 1:04:54.840
 There'd be a lot of firings. There would be a lot of mean things said to people.

1:04:58.280 --> 1:05:01.160
 I don't know what you make of that. How much as a leader,

1:05:01.160 --> 1:05:05.880
 are you allowed to just lose your shit in your love for the thing you're doing?

1:05:07.400 --> 1:05:08.600
 And how effective is that?

1:05:09.560 --> 1:05:11.480
 As a leader, you shouldn't be doing that very often.

1:05:11.480 --> 1:05:16.200
 So you can look back at me and say, well, Jocko, here's the most profitable company that's ever

1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:24.200
 existed. And so you're wrong. Well, going back to that multiple multitude of characteristics that

1:05:24.200 --> 1:05:28.120
 human beings can have. Well, it's the same thing with businesses. It's the same thing with companies.

1:05:30.920 --> 1:05:38.840
 Steve Jobs was off the charts in some of his traits, his ability to understand design,

1:05:38.840 --> 1:05:46.360
 his ability to understand human interface with computer systems. So, so far off the charts

1:05:47.640 --> 1:05:56.040
 that despite his bad temper, emotional behavior, the company still thrived.

1:05:57.880 --> 1:06:04.920
 That can happen. You can have people that are horrible leaders that develop something

1:06:04.920 --> 1:06:12.920
 that's so universally outstanding that you end up with a company that's successful.

1:06:14.280 --> 1:06:18.360
 The reason, I mean, I get asked that a bunch, people always ask me, because I say, look,

1:06:18.360 --> 1:06:24.440
 you shouldn't be losing your temper as a leader. Well, what about Steve Jobs? He used to yell and

1:06:24.440 --> 1:06:30.120
 scream all the time. Great. When people say that to me, I say, oh, okay. Are you as good at design

1:06:30.120 --> 1:06:38.760
 as Steve Jobs was? Are you as good at marketing as Steve Jobs was? He had a certain amount of skills

1:06:38.760 --> 1:06:45.320
 that were off the charts. And so he was able to be successful despite the fact that he would lose

1:06:45.320 --> 1:06:50.760
 his temper, treat people horribly. That's not good. It's not good. And it would have been even

1:06:50.760 --> 1:06:55.640
 more successful if he wouldn't had those characteristics. Now you might say, well,

1:06:55.640 --> 1:07:05.720
 he, his anger is what pushed things. Well, let me ask you this. What leader wins the leader

1:07:05.720 --> 1:07:12.840
 whose team is afraid, who the team who execute, executes the mission because they're afraid of

1:07:12.840 --> 1:07:18.360
 their leader or executes the task because they're afraid of their leader or the team that loves

1:07:18.360 --> 1:07:21.560
 their leaders so much that they don't want to let them down. They don't want to let them down.

1:07:21.560 --> 1:07:27.320
 Or the team that loves their leaders so much that they don't want to let them down. Which team wins?

1:07:28.120 --> 1:07:34.120
 You're implying a confidence that love is more powerful than fear, but I'm not so sure. This is

1:07:34.120 --> 1:07:40.520
 the Machiavelli question. You're saying ultimately it's always better to lead by inspiration and love

1:07:41.240 --> 1:07:48.920
 than by, by putting the fear into the team. What I'm, what I'm saying is that I've seen

1:07:48.920 --> 1:07:54.920
 countless times is me leading through my authority, leading through my rank,

1:07:54.920 --> 1:08:02.680
 leading through punitive measures is infinitely worse than me and you working together as a team

1:08:02.680 --> 1:08:12.200
 to win. On the second point of Steve Jobs is he has this idea of philosophy of eight players

1:08:12.200 --> 1:08:21.160
 where you have a group, like the power and the productivity of a group of what he called eight

1:08:21.160 --> 1:08:29.640
 players is invaluable. So you want to get a team of people who are the best at what they do.

1:08:29.640 --> 1:08:37.320
 But the most important aspect to him was that a single quote unquote B player on the team destroys

1:08:37.320 --> 1:08:42.600
 the entire productivity of the team. Is there something that it brings true to that? So he was,

1:08:42.600 --> 1:08:50.600
 I guess this could be a temper thing, but vicious about firing and removing the, uh, what he felt

1:08:50.600 --> 1:08:57.800
 was a toxic B player in a team. So eight players feed off of each other, unless there's one B

1:08:57.800 --> 1:09:04.920
 player present. It depends on the nature of the B player. Is the player, is the player a B player?

1:09:04.920 --> 1:09:13.640
 Is the player a B player because he's a little bit lazy? Is he a B player because he doesn't have a

1:09:13.640 --> 1:09:19.400
 good vision? Is he a B player because he's got a big ego and always thinks he's right

1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:24.280
 and now creates conflict in the team. So there's a bunch of different B players.

1:09:24.280 --> 1:09:29.400
 Look, if you're working for me and you're kind of a B player, but guess what? You're a grinder and

1:09:29.400 --> 1:09:33.720
 you get stuff done. I want you on the team. You might not be the smartest person I have,

1:09:33.720 --> 1:09:39.800
 but I know that you're committed to the team and I want you on the team. So you're a B player,

1:09:40.920 --> 1:09:48.520
 but that's okay. Now, if you're Lex with the giant ego, I'd rather have, I'd rather have Lex.

1:09:48.520 --> 1:09:52.360
 That's not quite as smart. Cause I got other people that are smart. I got other people that

1:09:52.360 --> 1:09:56.280
 are smart on the team. Look, you're going to need some smart people on the team, but a team

1:09:57.080 --> 1:10:02.040
 is made up. It's a team. And so you take these different components of a team. And if you have

1:10:02.040 --> 1:10:09.880
 complimentary components, you'll end up with a superior team. Then just basing it on the level

1:10:09.880 --> 1:10:16.920
 of, and what's an A player sometimes in the seal teams, they would get something called the stacked

1:10:16.920 --> 1:10:24.600
 platoon. And what that would be is someone, you know, some senior person in that platoon would

1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:31.240
 manipulate and maneuver to get the quote best guys that he could in that platoon. So, you know,

1:10:31.240 --> 1:10:36.440
 the most experienced guys, the person that had great, great reputations. And sometimes those

1:10:36.440 --> 1:10:41.880
 platoons would be great. Sometimes they would implode because what you end up with is a bunch of

1:10:41.880 --> 1:10:47.480
 A players. And now no one wants to follow anyone else. No one wants to agree with anyone else.

1:10:47.480 --> 1:10:50.760
 Everyone wants to do it my way. Not it's my way, not Lex's way. Lex is stupid. No,

1:10:50.760 --> 1:10:57.160
 you're stupid. We end up with problems. So can one person derail a team? Absolutely.

1:10:57.160 --> 1:11:00.360
 Under good leadership, one person should not derail a team.

1:11:04.360 --> 1:11:10.600
 This could be a tech thing too. There's some multiplying effect of just pure excellence,

1:11:10.600 --> 1:11:19.960
 no matter the personalities. I think for Steve Jobs, he doesn't, the ego doesn't matter. None

1:11:19.960 --> 1:11:24.760
 of that matters. What matters is the quality of the output, the genius of the result.

1:11:24.760 --> 1:11:30.120
 And that somehow multiplies itself. And the egos actually, like one of the problems with egos

1:11:31.400 --> 1:11:36.600
 is like, what does ego usually say? It says, I'm much better than you. When you have people that

1:11:36.600 --> 1:11:41.640
 are really good together, it's very hard for the ego to flourish because you're like constantly

1:11:41.640 --> 1:11:47.880
 being shown that you're not as good and there's a competition. So like, I think to his, his idea was

1:11:47.880 --> 1:11:53.400
 that like, if you get people that are really good at what they do, it turns out that you're not as

1:11:53.400 --> 1:12:00.520
 good at what you do. It turns as opposed to you being complacent and not doing much and thinking

1:12:00.520 --> 1:12:05.000
 you're better than everyone else and your opinion is better, is you almost getting in that competitive

1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:10.600
 race. You know that magic that happens when you're at the end of a marathon and you're just like

1:12:10.600 --> 1:12:15.800
 head to head, like you're just going full steam with a person that is as good as you. There's no

1:12:15.800 --> 1:12:22.520
 place for ego there. Which is great. Which is great. Let's use that example. You and I are racing,

1:12:22.520 --> 1:12:27.960
 the end of the marathon. We're both highly competitive, highly competitive. We have massive

1:12:27.960 --> 1:12:35.400
 egos and we both want to win. We both want to win so bad that we, we give everything we've got.

1:12:37.080 --> 1:12:42.200
 That's totally positive, right? Isn't that totally positive? Now imagine this same thing.

1:12:43.720 --> 1:12:48.600
 We're in a race, we're in a marathon, we're in the last hundred meters. It's you against me

1:12:48.600 --> 1:12:52.760
 and, and our egos are huge and we're pushing to win and you start to pull ahead of me

1:12:54.360 --> 1:13:01.560
 and my ego is so big and I hate losing so much that I somehow accidentally

1:13:02.120 --> 1:13:05.800
 push my knee up against your foot on a backstride and throw you onto your face.

1:13:06.840 --> 1:13:14.200
 So that's what ego, ego is an awesome driver unless you let your ego control you and you let

1:13:14.200 --> 1:13:20.360
 ego drive your decision making process, in which case it turns into an incredible problem. So

1:13:20.360 --> 1:13:25.960
 you might have someone that is excellent. You might have someone that's outstanding. You might

1:13:25.960 --> 1:13:31.560
 have some someone that's tens across the board, but their ego is so big that big that they can't

1:13:31.560 --> 1:13:36.120
 work with other people. They can't accept anyone else's ideas. They can't compromise on something

1:13:36.120 --> 1:13:40.120
 because they think their idea is better all the time and that is going to be problematic

1:13:40.120 --> 1:13:45.480
 and I don't want them on the team. Now as a good leader, guess what I'll do? I'll put them into a

1:13:45.480 --> 1:13:53.960
 situation where I can utilize their best aspects, but not have their ego destroy the team. So I

1:13:53.960 --> 1:13:58.840
 might say, Hey Lex, you know what? I actually want you to take lead on this part of the project over

1:13:58.840 --> 1:14:04.200
 here and since you're so smart and you work so hard, I know you're going to pull ahead of everyone

1:14:04.200 --> 1:14:10.040
 else. So you grind on that. Once you get that result, give it to me and I'm going to disseminate

1:14:10.040 --> 1:14:17.640
 it to the team. So I, I, I isolate you from wrecking yourself and the rest of the team with

1:14:17.640 --> 1:14:24.040
 your giant ego. So then, uh, looking at a completely opposite person was this a fascinating

1:14:24.040 --> 1:14:31.880
 person to me is Sandra Pichai, who's the CEO of Alphabet CEO of Google. I admire the

1:14:31.880 --> 1:14:38.920
 the, uh, in a romantic sense, the madness that is, uh, Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.

1:14:40.360 --> 1:14:47.560
 So to me, the opposite of that is Sandra Pichai, who's, uh, like everybody loves him.

1:14:49.080 --> 1:14:54.680
 And, uh, he's also a great listener. So he always brings people together. And so he went,

1:14:54.680 --> 1:15:00.760
 the, the, the energy of that person in the room is like the basic energy. If I were to summarize it,

1:15:00.760 --> 1:15:07.400
 it's like, I want to hear all the voices in the room. That's the energy he brings. And, uh,

1:15:08.440 --> 1:15:14.680
 it's almost like he doesn't want to impose a final decision. He wants to hear all the voices

1:15:14.680 --> 1:15:22.280
 and somehow always the decision just falls out. I don't know what to say about that.

1:15:22.280 --> 1:15:28.520
 What to say about that style of leadership, but it's always surprising to me how

1:15:30.520 --> 1:15:36.040
 that love brought a lot of people together and still, I mean, some of the greatest things Google

1:15:36.040 --> 1:15:42.920
 has done over the past several years, uh, could be attributed to that continued innovation,

1:15:43.640 --> 1:15:47.400
 bringing out the best out of people. There's of course, bureaucracy, which I could criticize

1:15:47.400 --> 1:15:51.720
 at the end of the day, which always happens with big companies. I would argue actually

1:15:51.720 --> 1:15:56.040
 the dictatorial style of Steve jobs and, you know, Musk helped fight the bureaucracy,

1:15:56.040 --> 1:16:01.480
 which is one criticism I would give of being a listener and being kind is sometimes you can't

1:16:01.480 --> 1:16:07.240
 cut through the as effectively, but he. He's one of the only people I've ever heard of

1:16:07.240 --> 1:16:13.720
 who everybody loves. He's inspirational figure to millions, especially in the, like in India,

1:16:13.720 --> 1:16:18.440
 he's a celebrity in the best kind of way. Is there something you could say about that kind

1:16:18.440 --> 1:16:24.120
 of leadership where you're never the asshole. You're never the dictator. You're always the

1:16:24.120 --> 1:16:32.520
 listener and, um, the compassionate empathetic glue that brings the team together basically

1:16:32.520 --> 1:16:40.760
 would love. Yeah. That's that's great leadership. If you have to choose for Google, uh,

1:16:42.680 --> 1:16:47.640
 for large companies, is there something to be said about what is more effective?

1:16:47.640 --> 1:16:52.280
 The dictator, uh, ruling by love or ruling by fear?

1:16:54.760 --> 1:17:00.440
 First of all, everything's a dichotomy, right? And so to think that all the time, you're always

1:17:00.440 --> 1:17:04.920
 going to be able to just bark orders at people and they're always going to listen to you. And

1:17:04.920 --> 1:17:09.160
 you're always going to get the best result. That would not be smart to think that every single

1:17:09.160 --> 1:17:15.080
 time you're going to come to a 100% consensus amongst the troops. And that decision is going

1:17:15.080 --> 1:17:22.760
 to reveal itself without you nudging it along. That would also be short sighted and naive. So

1:17:22.760 --> 1:17:27.880
 what you, what a good leader does is they, they, they stay balanced. And as much as they can,

1:17:27.880 --> 1:17:34.360
 they listen to what the troops have to say. They take that feedback. Maybe they quietly nudge things

1:17:34.360 --> 1:17:40.120
 and, and I'm sure he does that. I'm sure he does some nudging that maybe no one even picks up on.

1:17:40.120 --> 1:17:45.800
 You know, I like to say the best forms of leadership is leadership with minimum force required.

1:17:45.800 --> 1:17:51.560
 So if I can go into a room as a leader and not say one single thing and the team can come to

1:17:51.560 --> 1:17:55.880
 the right consensus and move in that direction, that's my preferred method. Maybe I have to give

1:17:55.880 --> 1:18:00.760
 them a little bit of a nudge, a 10% nudge in one direction. Okay. That's better than me walking in

1:18:00.760 --> 1:18:08.040
 there and giving them 100% dictatorial direction of exactly what I want to have happen. Now,

1:18:08.040 --> 1:18:13.320
 occasionally, if we have an emergency situation, people are starting to be frazzled and they're

1:18:13.320 --> 1:18:17.320
 not sure which direction to go. Then sometimes as a leader, you have to walk in and say, all right,

1:18:17.320 --> 1:18:24.600
 everyone here's where we're going. And people get on board. Why? Because for many years or months or

1:18:24.600 --> 1:18:30.840
 however long you've trusted them to come up with a plan. And when you trust, when you, as a leader,

1:18:30.840 --> 1:18:37.320
 trust your team to come up with a plan, the team starts to trust you and you get leadership capital.

1:18:37.320 --> 1:18:42.120
 And as you build leadership capital, occasionally you need to cash in some of that leadership

1:18:42.120 --> 1:18:46.280
 capital. You need to spend some of it. And maybe it is, hey, listen, here's the direction we're

1:18:46.280 --> 1:18:52.360
 going right now. We'll debrief it later, but we got to make a move. And the team who trusts you

1:18:52.360 --> 1:18:57.880
 says, Roger that boss, we got it. And all of them actually do this

1:18:57.880 --> 1:19:03.160
 interesting thing. I'd love to hear your opinion on it. Sondra certainly does it to a large degree,

1:19:03.160 --> 1:19:13.560
 which is it's in the process of delegation, trusting a person to do a really difficult thing,

1:19:14.360 --> 1:19:22.840
 like tossing it up and saying like, I trust you can get this job done

1:19:24.360 --> 1:19:31.000
 for some, even if your resume does not support that. I'm actually kind of amazed that human

1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:36.840
 beings when they're given the trust to get the job done, they step up very often. That's kind

1:19:36.840 --> 1:19:43.000
 of an amazing property of human nature. People often ask me issues about leadership. And I always

1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:47.400
 say that one of the best tools for teaching leadership and for teaching a bunch of other

1:19:47.400 --> 1:19:53.160
 lessons is leadership itself. So when it happens all the time, when you elevate someone into a

1:19:53.160 --> 1:20:00.040
 leadership position, they do step up and they do make things happen. So that's not surprising to me.

1:20:00.040 --> 1:20:05.320
 You do have to mitigate risks. So saying, Hey, you know, Lex, I know you're,

1:20:05.960 --> 1:20:11.240
 haven't been in the military before. I know you have very limited weapons experience,

1:20:11.240 --> 1:20:18.360
 but I want you to run a target assault on a real mission in whatever country that would not be

1:20:18.360 --> 1:20:22.520
 good. That would not be a good move on, on my part. Now, if I said, all right, Lex, you know what,

1:20:22.520 --> 1:20:26.840
 I want you to get some leadership experience. I've got a training mission and it's going to

1:20:26.840 --> 1:20:31.080
 be using paintball and I'm going to put you in charge of it. I got no problem doing that.

1:20:33.480 --> 1:20:39.160
 Some of that is judging human character is like, there's potential, there's something in this

1:20:39.160 --> 1:20:45.640
 person that they are, they have enough demons or whatever the hell it requires to have that fuel.

1:20:45.640 --> 1:20:50.760
 They'll figure it out. They'll hate themselves if they don't. And they'll find the right,

1:20:51.480 --> 1:20:56.280
 they'll find the tools that find the path to achieve the, whatever the level of perfection

1:20:56.280 --> 1:21:01.160
 they can. It's been really surprising to me. It's been making me rethink the whole hiring process

1:21:02.040 --> 1:21:07.480
 because I often now I'm thinking and looking, so I'm looking for people, both for the startup,

1:21:07.480 --> 1:21:13.640
 but just for my own life to help. And I almost want to see evidence of excellence,

1:21:14.840 --> 1:21:21.560
 but maybe you want to just based on just judgment of human character without evidence of excellence,

1:21:21.560 --> 1:21:28.520
 have people step up. Like Joe Rogan with Jamie, that's a funny side of it. I didn't understand

1:21:28.520 --> 1:21:34.200
 how little Joe knew about Jamie when he hired him. And Jamie stepped up and now runs one of

1:21:34.200 --> 1:21:39.960
 the most successful podcasts ever. And that's an incredible kind of, and he's one of the best

1:21:39.960 --> 1:21:45.560
 producers in the world now, not to let it get to his head. And by the way, the funny thing about

1:21:45.560 --> 1:21:49.880
 him. And one of the best Googlers in the world. One of the best Googlers. The funny thing about

1:21:49.880 --> 1:21:57.880
 Jamie, this is okay. You might not like this, but what I, what I like, I'm constantly exceptionally

1:21:57.880 --> 1:22:04.440
 self critical to a point of like self hating. Sometimes I deeply appreciate every single moment

1:22:04.440 --> 1:22:10.200
 I'm alive, but everything I've ever done, I feel like a shit. And when I talked to Jamie about

1:22:10.200 --> 1:22:16.520
 everything he's done, he's just in every way he carries himself. He's so self critical. He's so

1:22:16.520 --> 1:22:24.200
 he's so like worried that it's wrong. It's bad. That anxious energy. I love it. Cause that's how

1:22:24.200 --> 1:22:29.640
 you lead to growth and progress. Like you might, like a therapist might say, that's probably not

1:22:29.640 --> 1:22:36.760
 good for your like wellbeing. Fuck it. It's good for the what's good for your wellbeing is to create

1:22:36.760 --> 1:22:41.800
 awesome things. That's ultimately what leads to happiness is to, to create the best thing you can

1:22:41.800 --> 1:22:47.880
 in your life. And so when I see that in somebody like Jamie or anybody I talked to, when you're

1:22:47.880 --> 1:22:53.240
 really self critical, that's a good sign to me. Is that ridiculous? It's not ridiculous at all.

1:22:53.240 --> 1:22:57.480
 And it goes back, you know, you were, you were the way you were phrasing these questions about what

1:22:57.480 --> 1:23:05.400
 makes a good person and what makes a good leader, the way you phrase them kind of eliminated the

1:23:05.400 --> 1:23:10.600
 normal answer that I give the normal answer that I give. You asked me what makes a good leader,

1:23:10.600 --> 1:23:18.520
 what makes a good person is, is being humble. So when you're going to hire someone for your,

1:23:19.160 --> 1:23:24.440
 for your startup or whatever company you're creating, that is a key characteristic to look for

1:23:24.440 --> 1:23:30.440
 is someone that has the humility like, like young Jamie to say, yeah, you know, I, I could have done

1:23:30.440 --> 1:23:34.280
 this better and here's what I can improve. And here's what I need to work on. When you have

1:23:34.280 --> 1:23:40.280
 somebody that thinks they know everything out of the gate, you're, you're already got someone

1:23:40.280 --> 1:23:42.440
 that's going to be hard to deal with. They're going to be hard to coach. They're going to be

1:23:42.440 --> 1:23:47.160
 hard to mentor. When you have somebody that's truly humble, you barely, again, it's minimum

1:23:47.160 --> 1:23:52.040
 force required because when you say to Jamie after a show, how do you think that went,

1:23:52.040 --> 1:23:55.640
 he says, well, you know, I did this wrong and I didn't have this set up in time. And

1:23:55.640 --> 1:23:58.920
 you don't, you don't barely have to do anything because he's got the humility.

1:23:58.920 --> 1:24:03.080
 If you've got someone that's a big ego and you say, Hey, how did that show go? He goes,

1:24:03.080 --> 1:24:08.120
 I went awesome on my end. Now guess what you have to do. Now you have to start applying

1:24:08.120 --> 1:24:11.960
 force as a leader, which is expending leadership capital, which we don't want to do because we

1:24:11.960 --> 1:24:16.120
 always try and conserve our leadership capital as much as we possibly can. And when we have to

1:24:16.120 --> 1:24:23.240
 expend it just to get Jamie to make some improvements, that's bad. So when you go

1:24:23.240 --> 1:24:26.120
 looking for people, look for people that are humble. Now, does this mean you look for people

1:24:26.120 --> 1:24:29.480
 that don't have any confidence? No, that's not what I'm saying. There's a balance to all these

1:24:29.480 --> 1:24:35.480
 things. That's the dichotomy of leadership you, but people tend towards and look, I work with

1:24:35.480 --> 1:24:39.880
 a lot of military troops in the past. Now I work with companies. The reason I talk about

1:24:39.880 --> 1:24:47.240
 humility all the time is because for someone to be, get into a leadership position in the military,

1:24:47.240 --> 1:24:53.640
 they have to have confidence. So the tendency is that their confidence is going to outweigh their

1:24:53.640 --> 1:24:59.240
 humility at some point. Same thing with, with civilian companies. If you get to a point of

1:24:59.240 --> 1:25:03.880
 leadership inside of a company, you have to have confidence to get there. You don't get to a

1:25:03.880 --> 1:25:09.880
 position of leadership inside of a company lacking confidence. So the tendency is for

1:25:09.880 --> 1:25:16.680
 confidence to, to grow a little bit too much. And we have to put that, put that confidence into check.

1:25:16.680 --> 1:25:21.320
 We have to put that ego into check. Really good leaders. They're confident, but they're humble.

1:25:21.320 --> 1:25:25.880
 That's the balance of the dichotomy. Hear that, Jamie, don't get cocky.

1:25:25.880 --> 1:25:33.080
 On occasion. Rarely you talk about discipline. What does a discipline life look like doing what

1:25:33.080 --> 1:25:41.800
 you're supposed to do? What if I want to lay on the couch and eat Cheetos and watch soap operas?

1:25:41.800 --> 1:25:47.720
 That's that's not, that doesn't feel like discipline. Do you think you're supposed to do that?

1:25:47.720 --> 1:25:53.800
 Well, you know, you could argue from a, a sort of a meaning of life perspective that perhaps

1:25:53.800 --> 1:26:01.480
 happiness is the most important. And if it makes me happy, perhaps that's, if it's fulfilling,

1:26:02.120 --> 1:26:05.640
 of course, eating Cheetos and watching soap operas is fulfilling for nobody whatsoever.

1:26:06.840 --> 1:26:11.880
 Next question. But there's something about discipline that's more than that. We have to

1:26:11.880 --> 1:26:19.080
 like the rigor of habit, right? You, you wake up early in the morning, all the time.

1:26:20.600 --> 1:26:25.720
 What is it Jordan Peterson talks about? Make your bed. One place where you probably agree with

1:26:25.720 --> 1:26:32.360
 Jordan. People ask me if I make my bed. I don't. There's a disagreement with Jordan.

1:26:32.360 --> 1:26:32.840
 There we go.

1:26:32.840 --> 1:26:39.720
 I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't.

1:26:39.720 --> 1:26:46.360
 There's a disagreement with Jordan. There we go. You know, when I was younger, before I was married,

1:26:46.360 --> 1:26:53.000
 I didn't make my bed because I had one sleeping bag on it and I would get out of the sleeping bag.

1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:59.160
 There was nothing to make. Yeah. Now I'm married and I can't make my bed because my wife's in my

1:26:59.160 --> 1:27:07.960
 bed. So I don't make my bed. Okay. So what in your life, maybe we can talk about the one that's most

1:27:07.960 --> 1:27:13.560
 publicly facing, which is you wake up at four o clock or around four o clock in the morning.

1:27:14.280 --> 1:27:23.640
 You post on social media a picture of your watch. It being early, just to remind people that

1:27:25.160 --> 1:27:31.000
 you are a man of your word. What's that about? What's the philosophy of the four o clock?

1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:35.240
 What role does that play in a disciplined life for you?

1:27:35.240 --> 1:27:39.960
 Okay. From that perspective, what role it plays is getting a jump on the day.

1:27:40.920 --> 1:27:45.800
 And when you wake up early and you get a jump on the day and you've got your workout done,

1:27:45.800 --> 1:27:52.440
 and you've got a little bit of little bit of work done by the time normal people are getting up,

1:27:53.640 --> 1:27:58.600
 that's a win. That's a psychological win. And it's not just a psychological win. It's an actual win.

1:27:58.600 --> 1:28:04.600
 It's an actual win. So that feels great. It doesn't feel great. Maybe when your alarm clock goes off,

1:28:04.600 --> 1:28:10.680
 but by eight o clock in the morning and you've already accomplished some of the major tasks

1:28:10.680 --> 1:28:13.880
 that you have, some of the most painful tasks that you have for the day,

1:28:14.760 --> 1:28:16.840
 you're off to a great start and it's going to feel great.

1:28:19.240 --> 1:28:25.320
 Let's break this down then. What does then the rest of the day look like? What is the perfect,

1:28:26.920 --> 1:28:31.960
 productive, disciplined day in the life of Jaco Willink look like?

1:28:31.960 --> 1:28:34.040
 Wake up, workout.

1:28:34.040 --> 1:28:34.600
 Wake up when?

1:28:35.560 --> 1:28:36.840
 4, 4.30.

1:28:36.840 --> 1:28:37.560
 Workout when?

1:28:38.760 --> 1:28:42.520
 5, 5 to 6 or 7.

1:28:42.520 --> 1:28:43.560
 No eating?

1:28:43.560 --> 1:28:44.360
 No.

1:28:44.360 --> 1:28:46.600
 And then what does the workout look like?

1:28:46.600 --> 1:28:47.560
 Depends on the day.

1:28:48.760 --> 1:28:58.120
 What's the perfect? We're talking about body weight, lifting, cardio, heavy bag, jiu jitsu.

1:28:58.120 --> 1:29:04.760
 Okay. Yeah. When I say workout, I mean no jiu jitsu. So jiu jitsu comes later in the day.

1:29:06.200 --> 1:29:07.640
 So this is just you alone?

1:29:07.640 --> 1:29:12.200
 This is me alone working out. Yep. And I'm going to be doing a wide variety of things.

1:29:13.720 --> 1:29:20.280
 This is the thing that has the pictures of the aftermath with some sweat at the end. So the goal

1:29:20.280 --> 1:29:24.120
 is to do whatever the hell results in some sweat. And that takes an hour.

1:29:24.120 --> 1:29:32.040
 Sometimes it takes 12 minutes. Sometimes it takes three hours, depending on what kind of mood I'm in.

1:29:33.240 --> 1:29:43.000
 You got some demons to work through or is this just work? So you got the David Goggins who clearly

1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:47.880
 has demons screaming inside of his head that he's trying to work through. Are you just getting the

1:29:47.880 --> 1:29:54.280
 work done out of the discipline? Or is this, I think Joe is a little bit with David Goggins is like,

1:29:54.840 --> 1:29:58.680
 there's some ego, there's some bullshit that you're trying to get out through some of the exercise.

1:29:58.680 --> 1:30:01.880
 That's a good way to kind of humble you is just doing that exercise.

1:30:01.880 --> 1:30:03.720
 Well, exercise is certainly humbling.

1:30:06.280 --> 1:30:11.960
 I mean, it's, but it's physical conditioning, right? It's preparing your body so that you can

1:30:11.960 --> 1:30:14.760
 handle whatever it is you're going to do. Perfect.

1:30:14.760 --> 1:30:21.400
 What does, what do you do after? Let's talk about food. Hopefully surf. If the waves are good,

1:30:22.200 --> 1:30:29.000
 surf for how good are the waves? Let's say they're good. This is a perfect day. It's a perfect,

1:30:29.000 --> 1:30:38.600
 perfect waves. Why do you surf? It's fun. Okay. This is fun. Okay. Man, man and nature.

1:30:38.600 --> 1:30:47.080
 It was just like, what surfing is the ultimate is the power of the, the infinite power of the ocean

1:30:48.600 --> 1:30:52.840
 versus a little silly looking man on a board.

1:30:53.800 --> 1:30:57.880
 You could say it's the infinite power of the ocean versus a silly looking man on a board,

1:30:57.880 --> 1:31:03.560
 or you could say it's fun because it's Russian and romance. Okay. This is for fun

1:31:03.560 --> 1:31:06.920
 in the morning. Beautiful. And this is, you're still having eaten.

1:31:06.920 --> 1:31:13.000
 No. Okay. So when do you eat? I'll usually start grazing around 11 oclock

1:31:13.960 --> 1:31:18.680
 and grazing. What's the, what's the diet that's the, is there a perfect diet or do you graze?

1:31:19.640 --> 1:31:24.600
 I'll have, I'll eat some nuts, you know, something like that. I usually start grazing. Maybe I'll

1:31:24.600 --> 1:31:29.880
 have a little piece of meat or something like that. Does work enter any of this? I'm sure you

1:31:29.880 --> 1:31:35.480
 have a lot of people that want your attention. Yeah. Yeah. No work is work is about to happen.

1:31:35.480 --> 1:31:41.720
 Cause you know, even if I, if I woke up at four, worked out from five to six surf from six to eight,

1:31:42.760 --> 1:31:50.200
 now I'm starting to work writing, recording, reading, talking to clients.

1:31:51.240 --> 1:31:58.840
 Is there parts of the day where you try to find moments to think deeply, to read deeply,

1:31:59.400 --> 1:32:04.200
 to sort of really focus? Cause this world wants, it's full of distractions, right?

1:32:04.200 --> 1:32:09.480
 Right. Even talking to, uh, like even work stuff, the emails and all those kinds of things that can,

1:32:10.200 --> 1:32:14.680
 they can scatter your mind. Is there times you seek to have that focus?

1:32:14.680 --> 1:32:20.760
 Well, I read a lot of books. And so usually when I read, I'll be reading for a chunk of time,

1:32:20.760 --> 1:32:26.760
 maybe an hour at a time, maybe a little bit longer. And I might do that twice a day. So

1:32:27.880 --> 1:32:32.520
 I don't know if that counts as what you're describing, but then same thing with writing.

1:32:32.520 --> 1:32:37.720
 When I, when I'm writing something, I mean, I just, that's what I do. I write usually usually

1:32:37.720 --> 1:32:43.560
 write for about an hour. I can get about a thousand words an hour out of me. So that's,

1:32:43.560 --> 1:32:48.200
 that's sort of what I do. What does the rest of the day look like?

1:32:48.200 --> 1:32:52.200
 Just a lot of work, but one is the jujitsu. I want to find out about the jujitsu.

1:32:52.200 --> 1:33:02.920
 So round, round four, 30 or five oclock at night and train. Yep. And, uh, how hard you still, how,

1:33:02.920 --> 1:33:08.520
 how are you doing body wise? He still is the old man. Does the old man still got it or,

1:33:09.880 --> 1:33:10.760
 or are you talking to me?

1:33:15.080 --> 1:33:19.080
 It'd be good for viewership and ratings. If I die before the end of the podcast. So

1:33:19.080 --> 1:33:25.960
 so I, I, I still train with the same guys and I'll train, you know, so I've been very lucky

1:33:25.960 --> 1:33:30.120
 when it comes to getting injured and stuff like that. So haven't, I've had some injuries,

1:33:30.120 --> 1:33:36.360
 but they're, they're healed. And so, yeah, I train and, uh, food wise, you mentioned grazing

1:33:36.360 --> 1:33:41.720
 us some, uh, of some nuts, a very light kind of things. Is there a main meal here at night at

1:33:41.720 --> 1:33:48.440
 night? Yep. High, uh, in protein or is it anything? Yeah. I'll have like a steak and salad. I'll

1:33:48.440 --> 1:33:57.080
 usually have for dessert. I have like a protein shake. So is there a thing where at the end of

1:33:57.080 --> 1:34:02.760
 the, uh, at the end of the day, you will like, you have like a summarize sword and you meditate on,

1:34:02.760 --> 1:34:10.120
 uh, uh, death and, um, all those kinds of, is, is there some weird ritual you partake in? No.

1:34:10.120 --> 1:34:13.640
 You just go to bed when I get done with the end of the day, I might read a little bit more.

1:34:13.640 --> 1:34:21.880
 Read more. Yeah. Because reading makes me tired usually. Um, so I'll read a little bit more.

1:34:23.080 --> 1:34:27.720
 Is there a key to you that you can speak to that makes for a productive day?

1:34:28.360 --> 1:34:32.360
 Just the way you approach it mentally. Yeah. Write down what you're supposed to do,

1:34:32.360 --> 1:34:39.080
 wake up early and start doing it and then get it done. Yeah. I know it's a miraculous trick.

1:34:39.080 --> 1:34:43.960
 Can I ask you about Jiu Jitsu? By all means.

1:34:45.320 --> 1:34:48.600
 What have you learned from being a practitioner? You're a black belt.

1:34:49.560 --> 1:34:56.120
 What have you learned from this journey, uh, of, um, being a martial artist?

1:34:57.960 --> 1:35:05.960
 Jiu Jitsu for me was the connective tissue that started to join my mind together with

1:35:05.960 --> 1:35:12.120
 all the F different aspects of my life. And so Jiu Jitsu for me was, was really important.

1:35:12.120 --> 1:35:15.720
 And I don't think I would be doing anything that I'm doing right now if it wasn't for Jiu Jitsu.

1:35:16.440 --> 1:35:23.480
 So there's various aspects of my life that were in existence, but I didn't understand how they

1:35:23.480 --> 1:35:28.600
 were connected until I started training Jiu Jitsu. The primary things are interacting with other

1:35:28.600 --> 1:35:37.480
 human beings and combat tactics and strategy and Jiu Jitsu. And all those things are connected.

1:35:37.480 --> 1:35:42.920
 They all follow the same guiding principles. And I wouldn't have recognized those guiding principles

1:35:42.920 --> 1:35:49.240
 if I didn't do Jiu Jitsu. Can you elaborate? Cause you've trained for many, many years.

1:35:49.880 --> 1:35:55.480
 What, um, is it the hardship? Is it the humbling nature of just being tapped all over,

1:35:55.480 --> 1:36:02.680
 you know, nonstop, or I don't actually don't know how many times more times than you. Okay.

1:36:02.680 --> 1:36:08.120
 So good. Is it just the hardship of physical training, like the honesty of the mat in the

1:36:08.120 --> 1:36:13.640
 sense that like, you know, what works and what doesn't work, which, which aspects were the most,

1:36:13.640 --> 1:36:20.840
 uh, impactful for you? All aspects. So yes, from a humility perspective, when you realize you think

1:36:20.840 --> 1:36:23.720
 when you think, you know what you're doing, when you think you have certain skills

1:36:23.720 --> 1:36:26.840
 and you realize that there's always somebody better than you. And you realize that, Hey,

1:36:26.840 --> 1:36:31.800
 maybe I don't have all the answers all the time. And you bring that to a leadership perspective

1:36:31.800 --> 1:36:35.480
 and you walk into your platoon and you realize that maybe you don't have all the answers all

1:36:35.480 --> 1:36:39.400
 the time. And maybe you should listen to what other people have to say. You bring that to a

1:36:39.400 --> 1:36:44.120
 combat situation and you realize that you think if you sit there and think that you're smarter than

1:36:44.120 --> 1:36:50.120
 the enemy, you're going to be complacent. You're going to make mistakes. So there's one aspect out

1:36:50.120 --> 1:36:59.160
 of the gate, as far as, you know, if I, if I'm going to try and get your arm, do I attack your

1:36:59.160 --> 1:37:06.600
 arm? Maybe not directly, unless I'm a white belt. Exactly. What do I do? I attack your neck. And

1:37:06.600 --> 1:37:11.320
 when you reach up to defend your neck, that's when I get your arm. Well, if I'm out on the

1:37:11.320 --> 1:37:16.520
 battlefield and there's an enemy position, should I attack frontal assault into that position?

1:37:16.520 --> 1:37:19.960
 No, no, I shouldn't. I should put down some covering fire and I should maneuver around to

1:37:19.960 --> 1:37:26.120
 the flank. It's the same thing. If I'm dealing with you and you're my boss and you've got a giant ego

1:37:26.120 --> 1:37:29.640
 and you've come up with a plan and I don't like your plan, should I walk up to you and say, hey,

1:37:29.640 --> 1:37:35.880
 Lex, your plan isn't good? No. Or should I say, Hey, Lex, can I ask you some questions about how

1:37:35.880 --> 1:37:39.080
 you want us to execute this? Cause I want to make sure I understand your vision.

1:37:42.440 --> 1:37:44.040
 So all these things are connected. Yes.

1:37:44.040 --> 1:37:48.200
 And I wouldn't have realized that we could sit here and do this forever. We could, we could,

1:37:48.200 --> 1:37:54.920
 I could tell you these comparisons forever, but this, all this connective tissue, bringing all

1:37:54.920 --> 1:37:58.840
 these things together, I wouldn't have seen it without, I don't think I would have seen it without

1:37:58.840 --> 1:38:09.640
 jujitsu. So jujitsu to me had, it had a incredible life impact on me. Not look the physical part. Yes,

1:38:09.640 --> 1:38:18.440
 absolutely. Does it, does it keep you humble when you know that there's 145 pound individual that

1:38:18.440 --> 1:38:28.040
 can tap you out when you're 220 pound, 25 year old guy. And there's 135 or 140 pound, you know,

1:38:28.040 --> 1:38:35.320
 46 year old guy that can make you tap out. That's humbling. And, and what do you do with that? Do

1:38:35.320 --> 1:38:40.040
 you run away from it or do you continue to pursue it? Same thing with life. Same thing with anything.

1:38:40.680 --> 1:38:48.440
 So jujitsu is an incredibly powerful, not just physical aspect, but it's, it's a way to understand.

1:38:48.440 --> 1:38:54.440
 It's a way of thinking. You've also competed. Is there something you can speak to the value of

1:38:54.440 --> 1:39:03.160
 competition? Obviously you've been through combat, actual military combat is many, many, many, many

1:39:03.160 --> 1:39:10.840
 orders of magnitude, more high stakes than competition in a, in a silly sport like jujitsu.

1:39:10.840 --> 1:39:18.520
 Nevertheless, it still has some of the echoes of the same challenges. Is there something you can

1:39:18.520 --> 1:39:24.520
 speak to the value of competition for you? Yep. Competition will reveal weaknesses in your game

1:39:24.520 --> 1:39:31.400
 that you can then go back and train to rectify. So that, that's a big part of it.

1:39:31.400 --> 1:39:38.040
 So that that's very useful to serve. Yeah. As a testing ground, of course, training can be that

1:39:38.040 --> 1:39:44.840
 testing ground as well or, or that feedback. Yeah. But as you and I both know, if you and

1:39:44.840 --> 1:39:48.760
 I train together all the time, you'll know my game. I'll know your game. And even if we have

1:39:48.760 --> 1:39:53.080
 five other people, we all kind of understand each other's games and you're not doing something to me

1:39:53.080 --> 1:39:58.440
 that I don't expect. So when I go and compete, I'm good. You're good. You know, this random person

1:39:58.440 --> 1:40:03.480
 has a game that I've never seen before. I'm, and I may or may not know how to deal with that game.

1:40:03.480 --> 1:40:08.360
 If I know how to deal with it, great. I get the victory. Maybe I don't learn as much. If I don't

1:40:08.360 --> 1:40:15.000
 know how to deal with their game, I get the loss and I get the win of learning what some

1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:21.960
 weakness in my game is. So you mentioned offline that your friends and you work with Dean Lister

1:40:21.960 --> 1:40:28.440
 and Dean Lister is one of the people that inspired John Donoher, who I've very much been,

1:40:29.960 --> 1:40:33.000
 I've gotten a chance to talk to quite a bit recently.

1:40:34.600 --> 1:40:37.960
 I don't know what you think about this. This is not a therapy session, but

1:40:39.720 --> 1:40:49.160
 or maybe it is turning into one. He's a fascinating person, John Donoher, in terms of

1:40:49.160 --> 1:40:56.680
 creating almost a science of Jiu Jitsu to a level that I haven't seen before, which is

1:40:57.320 --> 1:41:03.400
 systems thinking about, like you can think about military combat as tactics in a particular

1:41:03.400 --> 1:41:09.560
 situation, but then you zoom out and you want to create entire systems of tactics in all situations,

1:41:09.560 --> 1:41:14.120
 right? He's very kind of wants to keep zooming out and creating giant systems.

1:41:14.120 --> 1:41:22.040
 And, which I appreciate that, even though the task is probably impossible to do completely,

1:41:22.040 --> 1:41:26.760
 but there is something that's in terms of competition that

1:41:29.560 --> 1:41:36.920
 he kindled a fire in me that I want to get back out there. He has a particular thing that did it,

1:41:36.920 --> 1:41:45.320
 which is very different from my personal journey in Jiu Jitsu, which was to a degree that people

1:41:45.320 --> 1:41:53.160
 I worked with cared about competition, it was always about winning or doing well,

1:41:53.160 --> 1:42:01.400
 all those kinds of things. For John, it's about winning, like winning is not even a thing that's

1:42:01.400 --> 1:42:12.520
 important. What's most important is winning by submission or dominance, right? And not just the

1:42:12.520 --> 1:42:19.960
 end, it's the entire time competing such that the only thing that matters is that kind of victory.

1:42:19.960 --> 1:42:23.880
 And that's a very different level of competition that's actually liberating in a certain kind of

1:42:23.880 --> 1:42:34.600
 sense. I remember so much of my competition was about fear of not taking risks. You get up on

1:42:34.600 --> 1:42:39.240
 points or you hold a strong position, you kind of advance and you get more points. Maybe you chase

1:42:39.240 --> 1:42:46.920
 the submission, but there's always a fear of risk. And for him, you embrace the risk. You should not

1:42:46.920 --> 1:42:54.120
 be competing out of fear. Live and die by the sword versus stay in safety. I don't know if there's

1:42:54.120 --> 1:43:02.200
 something to be said here. Well, you said it's novel to you, it's not novel to me. My entire

1:43:02.200 --> 1:43:10.920
 journey in Jiu Jitsu was only about submission. And as you mentioned, Dean Lister is my coach and my

1:43:10.920 --> 1:43:18.040
 main training partner for 20 something years. And if you ever watch Dean train or fight, that's what

1:43:18.040 --> 1:43:23.880
 he's trying to do is submit as everyone. That's what he's always done. That's what he always will

1:43:23.880 --> 1:43:30.280
 do. He, you know, he has the highest, I think he has impact. I know he has the highest submission

1:43:30.280 --> 1:43:38.520
 victories in ADCC. He, that's what he does. So this is, in fact, as Jiu Jitsu got bigger and

1:43:38.520 --> 1:43:47.640
 bigger, in fact, as Jiu Jitsu got more popular and we started seeing people competing to win by

1:43:47.640 --> 1:43:53.640
 points, that was what was novel to me in the beginning. Now it's the standard. So it's not

1:43:53.640 --> 1:44:00.760
 novel to me. I love the fact that John Donoher and all of his troops go out and they try and

1:44:00.760 --> 1:44:03.560
 submit people. I think it's awesome. And I think that's what Jiu Jitsu is.

1:44:03.560 --> 1:44:09.000
 All right. Let's ask for some advice for white belts. There's a lot of white belts who listen to this.

1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:13.080
 What advice would you give? You've been in Jiu Jitsu for many years. In terms of

1:44:15.240 --> 1:44:20.520
 a successful journey through Jiu Jitsu, what advice would you give them? People just starting out.

1:44:20.520 --> 1:44:24.280
 Just keep training, keep your ego in check. Don't freak out. Try and use the techniques

1:44:24.280 --> 1:44:27.960
 that you learn and all this stuff. So I'm like saying it, you know, notice how I'm saying it.

1:44:27.960 --> 1:44:28.280
 Yeah.

1:44:28.280 --> 1:44:31.240
 Hey, tap out, keep your ego in check.

1:44:31.240 --> 1:44:31.720
 It's common sense.

1:44:31.720 --> 1:44:35.320
 But the thing is everyone says this all the time and white belts still start off by going

1:44:35.320 --> 1:44:40.520
 completely nuts for at least, you know, three to six months of, I'm not going to let this guy tap

1:44:40.520 --> 1:44:44.360
 me out. And they're going to, and I'm going to tap this guy out, not by using technique,

1:44:44.360 --> 1:44:50.200
 but by just using strength. And it's just, it's just inhibiting your learning. So as much as you

1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:53.480
 can, I know, I know you got to get it out of your system. I know you don't want to tap. And I know

1:44:53.480 --> 1:45:01.720
 you want to tap somebody, but as soon as you get, get that off your chest, then try and, try and

1:45:01.720 --> 1:45:07.080
 relax and try and learn the techniques. It's perhaps counterintuitive. It never was to me,

1:45:07.080 --> 1:45:13.320
 but it's counterintuitive that to, to start on the journey of really sort of mastering Jiu Jitsu or

1:45:13.320 --> 1:45:19.480
 whatever, or improving is you have to relax. And that seems to be a very counterintuitive lesson.

1:45:19.480 --> 1:45:26.200
 I learned that early on with, that was thanks to the Russian system. I played piano and like music,

1:45:26.200 --> 1:45:31.560
 basically, actually this is true for basically any sport that includes the human body is like

1:45:31.560 --> 1:45:36.760
 relaxing is the way you, you start learning stuff. You have to learn, you have to literally,

1:45:36.760 --> 1:45:41.560
 and most people don't seem to understand this is like, you have to learn what it means for the

1:45:41.560 --> 1:45:48.520
 human body to relax. Like, I guess you have to have enough knowledge of all the muscles involved

1:45:48.520 --> 1:45:53.080
 to know what it means to relax those muscles. So for piano, you have to understand what it means

1:45:53.080 --> 1:46:00.120
 to relax your wrists and your fingers in order to learn how to move them. Like if there's tenseness

1:46:00.120 --> 1:46:07.560
 in the fingers, you're not going to like, you have to learn how to try hard while relaxed.

1:46:08.120 --> 1:46:14.120
 The, I guess the beginner, if you don't internalize this lesson, will try hard by

1:46:14.120 --> 1:46:21.080
 tensing up hard and like trying hard, tensing up more as opposed to relaxing more. And that lesson

1:46:21.800 --> 1:46:28.280
 cannot be conveyed through words, I guess. I've had the great fortune of having dictatorial

1:46:28.280 --> 1:46:34.600
 teachers as they do in Russia for piano and so on, where you get like hit if you don't learn

1:46:34.600 --> 1:46:37.880
 to relax, which is a counterintuitive notion, but it works.

1:46:37.880 --> 1:46:42.520
 Yeah. This brings me to one of my favorite pieces of coaching advice that I will tell

1:46:42.520 --> 1:46:46.360
 white belts while they're struggling on the mat. I'll tell them to relax harder.

1:46:47.800 --> 1:46:57.320
 Okay. That's beautiful. For somebody who studied war, who participated in war,

1:46:58.040 --> 1:47:04.920
 what do you think is the best martial arts for, let's call it self defense,

1:47:04.920 --> 1:47:12.200
 let's call it self defense for hand to hand combat outside the constraints of sport.

1:47:13.320 --> 1:47:22.440
 So it's not one answer. The answer to me is jujitsu, boxing, wrestling, Muay Thai,

1:47:24.200 --> 1:47:30.440
 judo, Sambo, and on down the list. I definitely start with jujitsu. The reason I start with

1:47:30.440 --> 1:47:38.200
 jujitsu is because in a self defense situation, if you are a big monster human and you want to

1:47:38.200 --> 1:47:45.960
 fight me and you square off with me, guess what I'm going to do? Run away. Cause I don't want,

1:47:45.960 --> 1:47:52.200
 I don't want to get involved. Even if I see skinny little Lex out on the street and you

1:47:52.200 --> 1:47:55.320
 start yelling at me and saying, you want to fight me? I don't want to fight you. I don't,

1:47:55.320 --> 1:47:59.480
 it doesn't matter. I don't care if I can beat you or not. What if you stab me? What if you

1:47:59.480 --> 1:48:04.040
 sue me after I get done throwing you onto the concrete? There's a million bad things that can

1:48:04.040 --> 1:48:10.920
 happen and almost nothing good. So for self defense, my first self defense is my feet to

1:48:10.920 --> 1:48:17.560
 get away from you. And if you square off to punch me, I can run away from you. If you square off to

1:48:17.560 --> 1:48:23.400
 kick me, I can run away from you. If you push me, I can run away from you. So great. I don't need

1:48:23.400 --> 1:48:31.320
 to know how to box to run away from you where this all changes is when you grab me. And now

1:48:31.320 --> 1:48:37.000
 I don't have the option to run away anymore. Now I actually have to know how to get away from your

1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:43.160
 grip. And that's where jujitsu comes into play. So, especially if you get me on the ground,

1:48:43.160 --> 1:48:49.080
 if you, if you grab me and get me on the ground, now I need to know how to get you off of me and

1:48:49.080 --> 1:48:55.640
 get up and get away from you so I can run away. So that's why I say start with jujitsu. And, and

1:48:55.640 --> 1:49:04.040
 from there, boxing, wrestling, judo, Sambo, Muay Thai. Yeah. There's a, there's certain in the

1:49:04.040 --> 1:49:09.880
 standing position. I mean, I'm a judo person as well. And, uh, the judo is very limited in their

1:49:09.880 --> 1:49:15.800
 understanding of the full grappling spectrum, even though they do all the things on the ground as

1:49:15.800 --> 1:49:21.320
 well. But, uh, it's so focused on the feet, but nevertheless, it's important to understand

1:49:22.600 --> 1:49:29.640
 the thing that judo has as a sport and it's good to practice that, uh, jujitsu doesn't

1:49:30.680 --> 1:49:39.640
 is, um, not just the, the skill of grappling on the feet, but the skill of explosive aggression

1:49:39.640 --> 1:49:46.840
 that, uh, sometimes jujitsu is more about in terms of tactics is more about patience. It

1:49:46.840 --> 1:49:52.600
 depends how you practice it, but because so much is, uh, about control and, uh, technique

1:49:53.160 --> 1:49:58.840
 that, uh, sometimes you don't get to practice like aggression, explosive aggression. And judo

1:49:58.840 --> 1:50:05.800
 is so much about, uh, aggression implemented in such a way that the demonstration of power is

1:50:05.800 --> 1:50:10.360
 effortless, right? That's the beauty of jujitsu. Yeah. And same thing with wrestling. Wrestling

1:50:10.360 --> 1:50:15.080
 also has a high level of intensity and aggression as well. Yes. Yeah. So that's where, that's where

1:50:15.080 --> 1:50:24.280
 I agree. Judo and wrestling. Absolutely. Awesome. Get some and striking boxing Muay Thai. Yeah. You

1:50:24.280 --> 1:50:31.560
 know, like the, you should train all these things. Are there books and movies in your life long ago

1:50:31.560 --> 1:50:38.360
 or recently that had a big impact on you? Uh, yeah, the main one is about face, which is sitting

1:50:38.360 --> 1:50:43.640
 right here. There you go. This is written by Colonel David Hackworth. That's the

1:50:45.640 --> 1:50:50.840
 book that really had a massive impact on me from a leadership perspective. And I ended up,

1:50:51.400 --> 1:50:55.720
 I talked about it enough that it started kind of coming back and started selling well and

1:50:55.720 --> 1:51:03.160
 they contacted me and I wrote a forward for it. So that book had a huge impact on me and I still,

1:51:03.160 --> 1:51:08.200
 when I read it, I still get lessons out of it just about every time. This is the Vietnam war.

1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:16.200
 And Korea. And Korea. And he got in towards the end of, right at the end of world war II. So he

1:51:16.200 --> 1:51:22.200
 was kind of raised by the, the soldiers that fought in world war II and then he went to Korea

1:51:22.200 --> 1:51:27.640
 and then he went to Vietnam. An exceptional warrior, a soldier soldier. If you can give

1:51:27.640 --> 1:51:40.200
 a little inkling what made him a soldier soldier. So I, he died in 2005 so I never got to meet him.

1:51:41.400 --> 1:51:50.520
 And I, I had a guy on my podcast who worked for him in Vietnam, a guy named general James

1:51:50.520 --> 1:51:59.000
 Mukiyama. And luckily his son had reached out to me and said, I think you're talking about my dad

1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:04.840
 cause I read some passage in there that, that Jim Mukiyama was young cap young captain Jim Mukiyama,

1:52:04.840 --> 1:52:10.520
 company commander in Vietnam. He said, I think you're talking about my dad. Would you want to

1:52:10.520 --> 1:52:14.280
 talk to him? And I said, absolutely. Well, here's the thing that I didn't really understand. And

1:52:14.280 --> 1:52:19.400
 you read one quote, but there's all these quotes in that book that talk about how great Hackworth

1:52:19.400 --> 1:52:24.760
 was and what an incredible leader he was and how he was the best combat leader anyone had ever seen.

1:52:24.760 --> 1:52:28.520
 And all these just really complimentary things that are said by a bunch of different people.

1:52:29.400 --> 1:52:33.640
 And when you read the book, you're reading this guy's account of what he went through.

1:52:35.960 --> 1:52:42.200
 But I never really knew if that was all true or did he just cherry pick his friends,

1:52:43.240 --> 1:52:46.920
 quotes about him and cherry pick the stories that he wanted to tell.

1:52:46.920 --> 1:52:51.640
 And so it was very interesting for me when I met Mukiyama, General Mukiyama, who he became a general

1:52:51.640 --> 1:52:57.080
 eventually when I met him and we were talking about his life. And I was very curious and I was

1:52:57.080 --> 1:53:02.040
 a little bit nervous going into this interview because I was thinking maybe my hero, my mentor,

1:53:02.040 --> 1:53:08.040
 this guy that I've never met before, maybe he's just an arrogant jerk that talked, talked himself

1:53:08.040 --> 1:53:14.200
 up in this book. So I'm sitting down with, with General Mukiyama and I finally got to the part

1:53:14.200 --> 1:53:23.720
 where he's meeting Hackworth for the first time. And I said, did, you know, did you know who

1:53:23.720 --> 1:53:29.240
 Hackworth was when he showed up? So he was Mukiyama, Muk, Muk, they call him Muk. Muk was the,

1:53:29.240 --> 1:53:36.520
 was the, like the adjutant to the, to the general that, that was going to, that, that Hackworth

1:53:36.520 --> 1:53:40.040
 was going to be working for. So when Hackworth comes into the office, the first person he meets

1:53:40.040 --> 1:53:46.040
 is this guy, this guy, Captain Mukiyama. And so Hackworth walks in and I said, when Hackworth

1:53:46.040 --> 1:53:54.360
 walked in, did you know who he was? And Mukiyama says, everybody knew who he was, Mr. Infantry.

1:53:54.920 --> 1:54:00.120
 And so he ended up explaining that everything that is written in there about Hackworth,

1:54:01.160 --> 1:54:07.880
 they, they just loved him. They adored him. Up the chain of command,

1:54:07.880 --> 1:54:11.320
 it turned out a little bit different. And, you know, the title of the book is about face. And

1:54:11.320 --> 1:54:17.000
 if you're familiar, familiar with military drill about faces, when you turn around 180 degrees,

1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:23.960
 and at the end of the Vietnam war, towards the end of the Vietnam war, he was so disgusted with

1:54:23.960 --> 1:54:28.520
 the way that the war was being fought. He was so disgusted with the decisions that were being made

1:54:28.520 --> 1:54:34.280
 by the leadership that he did an interview. He was the first Colonel, first senior officer to

1:54:34.280 --> 1:54:39.800
 do an interview that spoke out against the war that was happening. And this is while he's in

1:54:39.800 --> 1:54:46.440
 Vietnam, by the way. So he got drummed out of the army, and he was forced to retire. And that was

1:54:46.440 --> 1:54:53.800
 that. So there's an element of rebelliousness to him. And, you know, when you talk to me about,

1:54:53.800 --> 1:54:59.640
 are there times when the leaders making the leadership, this absolute senior leadership,

1:54:59.640 --> 1:55:04.520
 the civilian leadership is doing the wrong things? Yes. And there's times when people speak out

1:55:04.520 --> 1:55:08.280
 against it. And there's an argument for and against that, too, even even with Hackworth.

1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:13.560
 You know, did he when you get when you quit your job, or you do something that gets you fired,

1:55:13.560 --> 1:55:20.280
 which is what he did, you immediately give up all your influence over what's happening. So they get

1:55:20.280 --> 1:55:23.960
 another, they get another battalion commander to take his place, they get another colonel to step

1:55:23.960 --> 1:55:27.960
 in and take his place. That's what they do. And now he can't help anymore. And he's like,

1:55:27.960 --> 1:55:33.400
 and now he can't help anymore. He can't help his troops. But at that point in the war,

1:55:33.400 --> 1:55:44.760
 he loved his men so much that he was sickened with the situation on the ground. And he,

1:55:44.760 --> 1:55:50.840
 and he spoke out about it. So that book had a huge impact on me. And like I said, I still,

1:55:51.480 --> 1:55:56.440
 I still read it all the time. I reread it all the time. And I always take lessons from it.

1:55:56.440 --> 1:56:02.360
 But let me ask you about love. This is not usually associated with Jaco. But what role does love

1:56:03.160 --> 1:56:09.000
 in terms of friendship, in terms of family play in a successful life? And life in general?

1:56:10.760 --> 1:56:12.840
 Again, this is putting other people above yourself.

1:56:14.280 --> 1:56:17.000
 Do you see that as love? That's ultimately the implementation of love?

1:56:18.120 --> 1:56:19.160
 I would say yes.

1:56:19.160 --> 1:56:25.320
 Jaco, I've been a huge fan of yours. You're somebody who inspires me to get up early,

1:56:25.320 --> 1:56:30.680
 to get shit done, to be disciplined about my life, and to be the best leader I can be.

1:56:31.240 --> 1:56:37.800
 It's really, truly an honor. And thank you for wasting all your too valuable time with me. I

1:56:37.800 --> 1:56:39.880
 don't know what you were thinking, but thank you for doing it.

1:56:40.440 --> 1:56:44.920
 Well, thanks for having me on. I can guarantee I'm not as cool as you just made me sound.

1:56:44.920 --> 1:56:49.560
 I'm just out here, like I said, trying to help people out. And I think you're helping a lot of

1:56:49.560 --> 1:56:54.920
 people out with your podcast. So thanks for having me up here to share some of my experiences.

1:56:54.920 --> 1:56:57.000
 And hopefully I'll see you on the mat one day.

1:56:57.000 --> 1:56:59.800
 For sure. Looking forward to it. Could be sooner than you think.

1:57:00.760 --> 1:57:02.680
 Sounds like a threat. I love it.

1:57:03.720 --> 1:57:09.160

 There are no bad teams, only bad leaders.

1:57:22.440 --> 1:57:38.920
 There are no bad teams, only bad leaders. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
