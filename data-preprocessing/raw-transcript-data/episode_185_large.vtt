00:00.000 --> 00:02.600
 The following is a conversation with Sam Harris,

00:02.600 --> 00:03.920
 one of the most influential

00:03.920 --> 00:06.000
 and pioneering thinkers of our time.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.480
 He's the host of the Making Sense podcast

00:08.480 --> 00:10.420
 and the author of many seminal books

00:10.420 --> 00:12.840
 on human nature and the human mind,

00:12.840 --> 00:15.820
 including The End of Faith, The Moral Landscape,

00:15.820 --> 00:18.560
 Lying, Free Will, and Waking Up.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.640
 He also has a meditation app called Waking Up

00:21.640 --> 00:24.760
 that I've been using to guide my own meditation.

00:24.760 --> 00:26.760
 Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:26.760 --> 00:31.500
 National Instruments, Valcampo, Athletic Greens, and Linode.

00:31.500 --> 00:34.800
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.760
 As a side note, let me say that Sam

00:36.760 --> 00:39.160
 has been an inspiration to me

00:39.160 --> 00:41.320
 as he has been for many, many people,

00:41.320 --> 00:44.800
 first from his writing, then his early debates,

00:44.800 --> 00:48.280
 maybe 13, 14 years ago on the subject of faith,

00:48.280 --> 00:51.240
 his conversations with Christopher Hitchens,

00:51.240 --> 00:54.360
 and since 2013, his podcast.

00:54.360 --> 00:56.820
 I didn't always agree with all of his ideas,

00:56.820 --> 00:59.640
 but I was always drawn to the care and depth

00:59.640 --> 01:01.960
 of the way he explored those ideas,

01:01.960 --> 01:05.360
 the calm and clarity amid the storm of difficult,

01:05.360 --> 01:07.600
 at times controversial discourse.

01:07.600 --> 01:10.600
 I really can't express in words how much it meant to me

01:10.600 --> 01:14.080
 that he, Sam Harris, someone who I've listened to

01:14.080 --> 01:15.960
 for many hundreds of hours,

01:15.960 --> 01:18.120
 would write a kind email to me saying

01:18.120 --> 01:21.400
 he enjoyed this podcast and more,

01:21.400 --> 01:23.520
 that he thought I had a unique voice

01:23.520 --> 01:25.880
 that added something to this world.

01:25.880 --> 01:28.560
 Whether it's true or not, it made me feel special

01:28.560 --> 01:31.040
 and truly grateful to be able to do this thing

01:31.040 --> 01:33.640
 and motivated me to work my ass off

01:33.640 --> 01:35.400
 to live up to those words.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.880
 Meeting Sam and getting to talk with him

01:37.880 --> 01:41.660
 was one of the most memorable moments of my life.

01:41.660 --> 01:44.000
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,

01:44.000 --> 01:47.600
 and here is my conversation with Sam Harris.

01:48.700 --> 01:50.160
 I've been enjoying meditating

01:50.160 --> 01:52.680
 with the Waking Up app recently.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.760
 It makes me think about the origins of cognition

01:55.760 --> 01:58.560
 and consciousness, so let me ask,

01:58.560 --> 02:00.960
 where do thoughts come from?

02:00.960 --> 02:04.600
 Well, that's a very difficult question to answer.

02:04.600 --> 02:09.420
 Subjectively, they appear to come from nowhere, right?

02:09.420 --> 02:14.420
 I mean, they come out of some kind of mystery

02:14.680 --> 02:17.040
 that is at our backs subjectively, right?

02:17.040 --> 02:20.560
 So, which is to say that if you pay attention

02:20.560 --> 02:25.280
 to the nature of your mind in this moment,

02:25.280 --> 02:26.960
 you realize that you don't know

02:26.960 --> 02:29.120
 what you're going to think next, right?

02:29.120 --> 02:30.400
 Now, you're expecting to think something

02:30.400 --> 02:33.480
 that seems like you authored it, right?

02:33.480 --> 02:35.840
 You're not, unless you're schizophrenic

02:35.840 --> 02:38.440
 or you have some kind of thought disorder

02:38.440 --> 02:41.900
 where your thoughts seem fundamentally foreign to you,

02:41.900 --> 02:45.400
 they do have a kind of signature of selfhood

02:45.400 --> 02:50.040
 associated with them, and people readily identify with them.

02:50.040 --> 02:51.920
 They feel like what you are.

02:51.920 --> 02:52.960
 I mean, this is the thing,

02:52.960 --> 02:56.080
 this is the spell that gets broken with meditation.

02:56.080 --> 03:00.140
 Our default state is to feel identical

03:00.140 --> 03:02.640
 to the stream of thought, right?

03:02.640 --> 03:06.960
 Which is fairly paradoxical because how could you,

03:06.960 --> 03:11.880
 as a mind, as a self, if there were such a thing as a self,

03:11.880 --> 03:15.940
 how could you be identical to the next piece of language

03:15.940 --> 03:20.940
 or the next image that just springs into conscious view?

03:22.480 --> 03:26.440
 But, and, you know, meditation is ultimately

03:26.440 --> 03:28.960
 about examining that point of view closely enough

03:28.960 --> 03:32.000
 so as to unravel it and feel the freedom

03:32.000 --> 03:34.360
 that's on the other side of that identification.

03:34.360 --> 03:39.360
 But the, subjectively, thoughts simply emerge, right?

03:41.040 --> 03:43.120
 And you don't think them before you think them, right?

03:43.120 --> 03:46.120
 There's this first moment where, you know,

03:46.120 --> 03:48.640
 just anyone listening to us or watching us now

03:48.640 --> 03:50.960
 could perform this experiment for themselves.

03:50.960 --> 03:54.480
 I mean, just imagine something or remember something.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.640
 You know, just pick a memory, any memory, right?

03:56.640 --> 03:58.280
 You've got a storehouse of memory,

03:58.280 --> 04:00.980
 just promote one to consciousness.

04:02.680 --> 04:04.800
 Did you pick that memory?

04:04.800 --> 04:07.640
 I mean, let's say you remembered breakfast yesterday

04:07.640 --> 04:10.080
 or you remembered what you said to your spouse

04:10.080 --> 04:11.120
 before leaving the house,

04:11.120 --> 04:13.880
 or you remembered what you watched on Netflix last night,

04:13.880 --> 04:16.020
 or you remembered something that happened to you

04:16.020 --> 04:18.820
 when you were four years old, whatever it is, right?

04:20.440 --> 04:24.200
 First it wasn't there, and then it appeared.

04:24.200 --> 04:28.500
 And that is not a, well, I'm sure we'll get to the topic

04:28.500 --> 04:30.900
 of free will, ultimately.

04:30.900 --> 04:33.200
 That's not evidence of free will, right?

04:33.200 --> 04:35.440
 Why are you so sure, by the way?

04:35.440 --> 04:36.280
 It's very interesting.

04:36.280 --> 04:38.480
 Well, through no free will of my own, yeah.

04:38.480 --> 04:42.120
 Everything just appears, right?

04:42.120 --> 04:43.640
 What else could it do?

04:43.640 --> 04:45.480
 And so that's the subjective side of it.

04:45.480 --> 04:48.000
 Objectively, you know, we have every reason to believe

04:48.000 --> 04:50.840
 that many of our thoughts, all of our thoughts

04:50.840 --> 04:55.840
 are at bottom what some part of our brain is doing

04:57.140 --> 04:58.080
 neurophysiologically.

04:58.080 --> 05:00.000
 I mean, these are the products

05:00.000 --> 05:02.500
 of some kind of neural computation

05:02.500 --> 05:06.860
 and neural representation when we're talking about memories.

05:06.860 --> 05:10.660
 Is it possible to pull at the string of thoughts

05:10.660 --> 05:12.560
 to try to get to its root?

05:14.080 --> 05:17.640
 To try to dig in past the obvious surface,

05:17.640 --> 05:20.680
 subjective experience of like the thoughts pop out

05:20.680 --> 05:21.640
 out of nowhere.

05:21.640 --> 05:24.460
 Is it possible to somehow get closer to the roots

05:24.460 --> 05:28.720
 of where they come out of from the firing of the cells?

05:28.720 --> 05:32.480
 Or is it a useless pursuit to dig into that direction?

05:32.480 --> 05:37.480
 Well, you can get closer to many, many subtle contents

05:38.280 --> 05:39.960
 in consciousness, right?

05:39.960 --> 05:42.000
 So you can notice things more and more clearly

05:42.000 --> 05:44.360
 and have a landscape of mind open up

05:44.360 --> 05:47.800
 and become more differentiated and more interesting.

05:47.800 --> 05:51.800
 And if you take psychedelics, you know, it opens up wide,

05:51.800 --> 05:53.960
 depending on what you've taken and the dose, you know,

05:53.960 --> 05:57.200
 it opens in directions and to an extent that, you know,

05:57.200 --> 05:59.760
 very few people imagine would be possible,

05:59.760 --> 06:01.960
 but for having had those experiences.

06:01.960 --> 06:06.960
 But this idea of you getting closer to something,

06:07.200 --> 06:09.080
 to the datum of your mind,

06:09.080 --> 06:11.280
 or such as something of interest in there,

06:11.280 --> 06:16.280
 or something that's more real is ultimately undermined

06:16.360 --> 06:17.400
 because there's no place

06:17.400 --> 06:19.560
 from which you're getting closer to it.

06:19.560 --> 06:22.520
 There's no your part of that journey, right?

06:22.520 --> 06:25.440
 Like we tend to start out, you know,

06:25.440 --> 06:29.120
 whether it's in meditation or in any kind

06:29.120 --> 06:33.560
 of self examination or, you know, taking psychedelics,

06:33.560 --> 06:36.000
 we start out with this default point of view

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
 of feeling like we're the kind of the rider

06:41.400 --> 06:42.600
 on the horse of consciousness,

06:42.600 --> 06:46.640
 or we're the man in the boat going down the stream

06:46.640 --> 06:47.800
 of consciousness, right?

06:47.800 --> 06:49.720
 But we're so we're differentiated

06:49.720 --> 06:54.720
 from what we know cognitively, introspectively,

06:56.140 --> 06:58.120
 but that feeling of being differentiated,

06:58.120 --> 06:59.520
 that feeling of being a self

06:59.520 --> 07:01.680
 that can strategically pay attention

07:01.680 --> 07:03.320
 to some contents of consciousness

07:04.680 --> 07:06.680
 is what it's like to be identified

07:06.680 --> 07:09.460
 with some part of the stream of thought

07:09.460 --> 07:10.880
 that's going uninspected, right?

07:10.880 --> 07:13.560
 Like it's a false point of view.

07:13.560 --> 07:16.740
 And when you see that and cut through that,

07:16.740 --> 07:20.780
 then this sense of this notion of going deeper

07:21.640 --> 07:25.480
 kind of breaks apart because really there is no depth.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.240
 Ultimately, everything is right on the surface.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.020
 Everything, there's no center to consciousness.

07:29.020 --> 07:30.460
 There's just consciousness and its contents.

07:30.460 --> 07:33.160
 And those contents can change vastly.

07:33.160 --> 07:36.740
 Again, if you drop acid, you know, the contents change.

07:37.920 --> 07:42.640
 But there's, in some sense, that doesn't represent

07:43.900 --> 07:46.480
 a position of depth versus, the continuum

07:46.480 --> 07:49.240
 of depth versus surface has broken apart.

07:49.240 --> 07:51.560
 So you're taking as a starting point

07:51.560 --> 07:54.280
 that there is a horse called consciousness

07:54.280 --> 07:55.760
 and you're riding it.

07:55.760 --> 07:57.680
 And the actual riding is very shallow.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.720
 This is all surface.

07:59.720 --> 08:02.520
 So let me ask about that horse.

08:02.520 --> 08:04.160
 What's up with the horse?

08:04.160 --> 08:06.220
 What is consciousness?

08:07.280 --> 08:09.760
 From where does it emerge?

08:09.760 --> 08:13.040
 How like fundamental is it to the physics of reality?

08:13.040 --> 08:16.560
 How fundamental is it to what it means to be human?

08:16.560 --> 08:18.620
 And I'm just asking for a friend

08:18.620 --> 08:20.160
 so that we can build it

08:20.160 --> 08:22.660
 in our artificial intelligence systems.

08:22.660 --> 08:26.620
 Yeah, well, that remains to be seen if we can,

08:26.620 --> 08:30.220
 if we will build it purposefully or just by accident.

08:30.220 --> 08:34.400
 It's a major ethical problem, potentially.

08:35.660 --> 08:39.240
 That, I mean, my concern here is that we may, in fact,

08:40.220 --> 08:44.060
 build artificial intelligence that passes the Turing test,

08:44.060 --> 08:47.100
 which we begin to treat not only as super intelligent

08:47.100 --> 08:50.940
 because it obviously is and demonstrates that,

08:50.940 --> 08:53.200
 but we begin to treat it as conscious

08:53.200 --> 08:54.940
 because it will seem conscious.

08:54.940 --> 08:56.860
 We will have built it to seem conscious.

08:56.860 --> 09:01.420
 And unless we understand exactly how consciousness emerges

09:01.420 --> 09:04.940
 from physics, we won't actually know

09:04.940 --> 09:06.340
 that these systems are conscious, right?

09:06.340 --> 09:08.020
 We'll just, they may say,

09:08.020 --> 09:11.020
 listen, you can't turn me off because that's a murder, right?

09:11.020 --> 09:15.300
 And we will be convinced by that dialogue

09:15.300 --> 09:18.580
 because we will, just in the extreme case,

09:18.580 --> 09:20.820
 who knows when we'll get there.

09:20.820 --> 09:25.820
 But if we build something like perfectly humanoid robots

09:25.940 --> 09:27.580
 that are more intelligent than we are,

09:27.580 --> 09:30.320
 so we're basically in a Westworld like situation,

09:31.260 --> 09:33.180
 there's no way we're going to withhold

09:33.180 --> 09:35.660
 an attribution of consciousness from those machines.

09:35.660 --> 09:36.900
 They're just gonna seem,

09:36.900 --> 09:39.020
 they're just gonna advertise our consciousness

09:39.020 --> 09:41.980
 in every glance and every utterance,

09:42.940 --> 09:44.780
 but we won't know.

09:44.780 --> 09:47.380
 And we won't know in some deeper sense

09:47.380 --> 09:50.540
 than we can be skeptical of the consciousness

09:50.540 --> 09:51.380
 of other people.

09:51.380 --> 09:52.660
 I mean, someone could roll that back and say,

09:52.660 --> 09:54.340
 well, you don't, I don't know that you're conscious

09:54.340 --> 09:55.380
 or you don't know that I'm conscious.

09:55.380 --> 09:57.140
 We're just passing the Turing test for one another,

09:57.140 --> 10:02.140
 but that kind of solipsism isn't justified biologically,

10:02.260 --> 10:06.180
 or we just, anything we understand about the mind

10:06.180 --> 10:08.620
 biologically suggests that you and I

10:08.620 --> 10:12.280
 are part of the same roll of the dice

10:13.180 --> 10:18.060
 in terms of how intelligent and conscious systems emerged

10:18.060 --> 10:21.900
 in the wetware of brains like ours, right?

10:21.900 --> 10:24.220
 So it's not parsimonious for me to think

10:24.220 --> 10:26.120
 that I might be the only conscious person

10:26.120 --> 10:27.820
 or even the only conscious primate.

10:29.340 --> 10:30.620
 I would argue it's not parsimonious

10:30.620 --> 10:33.940
 to withhold consciousness from other apes

10:34.860 --> 10:36.580
 and even other mammals ultimately.

10:36.580 --> 10:38.440
 And once you get beyond the mammals,

10:38.440 --> 10:41.420
 then my intuitions are not really clear.

10:41.420 --> 10:45.020
 The question of how it emerges is genuinely uncertain

10:45.020 --> 10:48.180
 and ultimately the question of whether it emerges

10:48.180 --> 10:49.340
 is still uncertain.

10:49.340 --> 10:54.160
 You can, you know, it's not fashionable to think this,

10:54.160 --> 10:58.240
 but you can certainly argue that consciousness

10:58.240 --> 11:00.920
 might be a fundamental principle of matter

11:00.920 --> 11:04.140
 that doesn't emerge on the basis of information processing,

11:04.140 --> 11:08.680
 even though everything else that we recognize

11:08.680 --> 11:11.460
 about ourselves as minds almost certainly does emerge,

11:11.460 --> 11:13.180
 you know, like an ability to process language,

11:13.180 --> 11:15.780
 that clearly is a matter of information processing

11:15.780 --> 11:18.300
 because you can disrupt that process in ways

11:18.300 --> 11:22.620
 that is just so clear.

11:22.620 --> 11:26.980
 And the problem that the confound with consciousness

11:26.980 --> 11:30.660
 is that, yes, we can seem to interrupt consciousness.

11:30.660 --> 11:33.020
 I mean, you can give someone general anesthesia

11:33.020 --> 11:35.280
 and then you wake them up and you ask them,

11:35.280 --> 11:36.120
 well, what was that like?

11:36.120 --> 11:38.640
 And they say, nothing, I don't remember anything,

11:38.640 --> 11:43.640
 but it's hard to differentiate a mere failure of memory

11:46.220 --> 11:49.100
 from a genuine interruption in consciousness.

11:49.100 --> 11:51.740
 Whereas it's not with, you know, interrupting speech,

11:51.740 --> 11:53.580
 you know, we know when we've done it.

11:53.580 --> 11:57.660
 And it's just obvious that, you know,

11:57.660 --> 11:59.460
 you disrupt the right neural circuits

11:59.460 --> 12:01.880
 and, you know, you've disrupted speech.

12:01.880 --> 12:04.660
 So if you had to bet all your money on one camp or the other,

12:04.660 --> 12:09.020
 would you say, do you err on the side of panpsychism

12:09.020 --> 12:11.900
 where consciousness is really fundamental

12:11.900 --> 12:16.780
 to all of reality or more on the other side,

12:16.780 --> 12:20.220
 which is like, it's a nice little side effect,

12:20.220 --> 12:23.980
 a useful like hack for us humans to survive.

12:23.980 --> 12:26.260
 Where, on that spectrum, where do you land

12:26.260 --> 12:27.900
 when you think about consciousness,

12:27.900 --> 12:30.380
 especially from an engineering perspective?

12:30.380 --> 12:35.140
 I'm truly agnostic on this point, I mean, I think I'm,

12:35.140 --> 12:37.780
 you know, it's kind of in coin toss mode for me.

12:37.780 --> 12:42.780
 I don't know, and panpsychism is not so compelling to me.

12:44.980 --> 12:46.900
 Again, it just seems unfalsifiable.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.020
 I wouldn't know how the universe would be different

12:49.020 --> 12:50.700
 if panpsychism were true.

12:50.700 --> 12:53.260
 It's just to remind people panpsychism is this idea

12:53.260 --> 12:57.260
 that consciousness may be pushed all the way down

12:57.260 --> 12:59.580
 into the most fundamental constituents of matters.

12:59.580 --> 13:01.100
 So there might be something that it's like

13:01.100 --> 13:05.100
 to be an electron or, you know, a cork,

13:05.100 --> 13:08.980
 but then you wouldn't expect anything to be different

13:08.980 --> 13:12.460
 at the macro scale, or at least I wouldn't expect

13:12.460 --> 13:13.660
 anything to be different.

13:14.740 --> 13:16.700
 So it may be unfalsifiable.

13:16.700 --> 13:20.500
 It just might be that reality is not something

13:22.240 --> 13:26.100
 we're as in touch with as we think we are,

13:26.100 --> 13:31.100
 and that at its base layer to kind of break it into mind

13:31.900 --> 13:34.540
 and matter as we've done ontologically

13:35.540 --> 13:37.340
 is to misconstrue it, right?

13:37.340 --> 13:40.940
 I mean, there could be some kind of neutral monism

13:40.940 --> 13:41.940
 at the bottom, and this, you know,

13:41.940 --> 13:43.900
 this idea doesn't originate with me.

13:43.900 --> 13:47.260
 This goes all the way back to Bertrand Russell

13:47.260 --> 13:50.900
 and others, you know, 100 plus years ago,

13:50.900 --> 13:53.980
 but I just feel like the concepts we're using

13:53.980 --> 13:58.980
 to divide consciousness and matter

13:59.060 --> 14:02.300
 may in fact be part of our problem, right?

14:02.300 --> 14:05.980
 Where the rubber hits the road psychologically here

14:05.980 --> 14:08.820
 are things like, well, what is death, right?

14:08.820 --> 14:12.540
 Like do we, any expectation that we survive death

14:12.540 --> 14:14.540
 or any part of us survives death,

14:14.540 --> 14:19.540
 that really seems to be the many people's concern here.

14:20.260 --> 14:23.140
 Well, I tend to believe just as a small little tangent,

14:23.140 --> 14:24.660
 like I'm with Ernest Becker on this,

14:24.660 --> 14:27.700
 that there's some, it's interesting to think

14:27.700 --> 14:29.240
 about death and consciousness,

14:29.240 --> 14:32.420
 which one is the chicken, which one is the egg,

14:32.420 --> 14:34.620
 because it feels like death could be the very thing,

14:34.620 --> 14:36.900
 like our knowledge of mortality could be the very thing

14:36.900 --> 14:38.420
 that creates the consciousness.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.460
 Yeah, well, then you're using consciousness

14:41.460 --> 14:43.700
 differently than I am.

14:43.700 --> 14:47.060
 I mean, so for me, consciousness is just the fact

14:47.060 --> 14:49.980
 that the lights are on at all,

14:49.980 --> 14:53.260
 there's an experiential quality to anything.

14:53.260 --> 14:56.260
 So much of the processing that's happening

14:56.260 --> 15:00.500
 in our brains right now certainly seems to be happening

15:00.500 --> 15:01.900
 in the dark, right?

15:01.900 --> 15:06.220
 Like it's not associated with this qualitative sense

15:06.220 --> 15:08.780
 that there's something that it's like to be that part

15:08.780 --> 15:11.640
 of the mind doing that mental thing.

15:13.520 --> 15:16.940
 But for other parts, the lights are on

15:16.940 --> 15:18.580
 and we can talk about,

15:18.580 --> 15:20.320
 and whether we talk about it or not,

15:20.320 --> 15:25.320
 we can feel directly that there's something

15:25.860 --> 15:27.020
 that it's like to be us.

15:27.020 --> 15:29.740
 There's something, something seems to be happening, right?

15:29.740 --> 15:34.260
 And the seeming in our case is broken into vision

15:34.260 --> 15:36.820
 and hearing and proprioception

15:36.820 --> 15:41.820
 and taste and smell and thought and emotion.

15:42.340 --> 15:45.100
 I mean, there are the contents of consciousness

15:45.100 --> 15:50.100
 that we are familiar with

15:50.460 --> 15:53.260
 and that we can have direct access to

15:53.260 --> 15:56.480
 in any present moment when we're, quote, conscious.

15:57.540 --> 16:00.140
 And even if we're confused about them,

16:00.140 --> 16:02.300
 even if we're asleep and dreaming

16:02.300 --> 16:04.060
 and it's not a lucid dream,

16:04.060 --> 16:07.840
 we're just totally confused about our circumstance,

16:07.840 --> 16:11.420
 what you can't say is that we're confused

16:11.420 --> 16:12.500
 about consciousness.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.660
 Like you can't say that consciousness itself

16:14.660 --> 16:18.900
 might be an illusion because on this account,

16:18.900 --> 16:22.140
 it just means that things seem any way at all.

16:22.140 --> 16:23.340
 I mean, even like if this,

16:23.340 --> 16:26.420
 it seems to me that I'm seeing a cup on the table.

16:26.420 --> 16:27.540
 Now I could be wrong about that.

16:27.540 --> 16:28.500
 It could be a hologram.

16:28.500 --> 16:29.780
 I could be asleep and dreaming.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.540
 I could be hallucinating,

16:31.540 --> 16:35.140
 but the seeming part isn't really up for grabs

16:35.140 --> 16:37.620
 in terms of being an illusion.

16:37.620 --> 16:41.660
 It's not, something seems to be happening.

16:41.660 --> 16:45.740
 And that seeming is the context in which

16:45.740 --> 16:50.020
 every other thing we can notice about ourselves

16:50.020 --> 16:50.860
 can be noticed.

16:50.860 --> 16:53.540
 And it's also the context in which certain illusions

16:53.540 --> 16:55.460
 can be cut through because we're not,

16:55.460 --> 16:57.860
 we can be wrong about what it's like to be us.

16:57.860 --> 17:01.980
 And we can, I'm not saying we're incorrigible

17:01.980 --> 17:04.460
 with respect to our claims

17:04.460 --> 17:05.700
 about the nature of our experience,

17:05.700 --> 17:10.140
 but for instance, many people feel like they have a self

17:10.140 --> 17:11.860
 and they feel like it has free will.

17:11.860 --> 17:14.340
 And I'm quite sure at this point

17:14.340 --> 17:15.260
 that they're wrong about that,

17:15.260 --> 17:19.900
 and that you can cut through those experiences

17:19.900 --> 17:22.140
 and then things seem a different way, right?

17:22.140 --> 17:25.020
 So it's not that things don't,

17:25.020 --> 17:26.500
 there aren't discoveries to be made there

17:26.500 --> 17:28.220
 and assumptions to be overturned,

17:28.220 --> 17:33.220
 but this kind of consciousness is something

17:33.980 --> 17:38.220
 that I would think, it doesn't just come online

17:38.220 --> 17:39.700
 when we get language.

17:39.700 --> 17:42.500
 It doesn't just come online when we form a concept of death

17:42.500 --> 17:45.260
 or the finiteness of life.

17:45.260 --> 17:48.220
 It doesn't require a sense of self, right?

17:48.220 --> 17:50.420
 So it doesn't, it's prior

17:50.420 --> 17:52.500
 to a differentiating self and other.

17:54.140 --> 17:58.860
 And I wouldn't even think it's necessarily limited to people.

17:58.860 --> 18:03.860
 I do think probably any mammal has this,

18:04.140 --> 18:07.500
 but certainly if you're going to presuppose

18:07.500 --> 18:11.980
 that something about our brains is producing this, right?

18:11.980 --> 18:15.580
 And that's a very safe assumption,

18:15.580 --> 18:18.300
 even though we can't,

18:18.300 --> 18:20.620
 even though you can argue the jury's still out

18:20.620 --> 18:22.180
 to some degree,

18:22.180 --> 18:24.740
 then it's very hard to draw a principled line

18:24.740 --> 18:26.620
 between us and chimps,

18:26.620 --> 18:30.140
 or chimps and rats even in the end,

18:30.140 --> 18:33.140
 given the underlying neural similarities.

18:33.140 --> 18:35.980
 So, and I don't know phylogenetically,

18:35.980 --> 18:38.620
 I don't know how far back to push that.

18:38.620 --> 18:41.700
 There are people who think single cells might be conscious

18:41.700 --> 18:43.460
 or that flies are certainly conscious.

18:43.460 --> 18:47.940
 They've got something like 100,000 neurons in their brains.

18:47.940 --> 18:52.940
 I mean, there's a lot going on even in a fly, right?

18:53.180 --> 18:55.500
 But I don't have intuitions about that.

18:55.500 --> 18:58.260
 But it's not in your sense an illusion you can cut through.

18:58.260 --> 19:00.100
 I mean, to push back,

19:00.100 --> 19:03.140
 the alternative version could be it is an illusion

19:03.140 --> 19:06.580
 constructed by, just by humans.

19:06.580 --> 19:08.140
 I'm not sure I believe this,

19:08.140 --> 19:10.160
 but in part of me hopes this is true

19:10.160 --> 19:12.540
 because it makes it easier to engineer,

19:12.540 --> 19:16.460
 is that humans are able to contemplate their mortality

19:17.420 --> 19:21.460
 and that contemplation in itself creates consciousness.

19:21.460 --> 19:24.200
 That like the rich lights on experience.

19:24.200 --> 19:26.380
 So the lights don't actually even turn on

19:26.380 --> 19:29.660
 in the way that you're describing until after birth

19:30.740 --> 19:31.900
 in that construction.

19:31.900 --> 19:34.980
 So do you think it's possible that that is the case?

19:34.980 --> 19:39.320
 That it is a sort of construct of the way we deal,

19:39.320 --> 19:42.860
 almost like a social tool to deal with the reality

19:42.860 --> 19:45.620
 of the world, the social interaction with other humans?

19:46.580 --> 19:49.020
 Or is, because you're saying the complete opposite,

19:49.020 --> 19:53.140
 which is it's like fundamental to single cell organisms

19:53.140 --> 19:54.900
 and trees and so on.

19:54.900 --> 19:57.840
 Right, well, yeah, so I don't know how far down to push it.

19:57.840 --> 20:00.540
 I don't have intuitions that single cells

20:00.540 --> 20:01.660
 are likely to be conscious,

20:01.660 --> 20:06.660
 but they might be, and again, it could be unfalsifiable.

20:08.180 --> 20:10.480
 But as far as babies not being conscious,

20:10.480 --> 20:12.040
 or you don't become conscious

20:12.040 --> 20:14.500
 until you can recognize yourself in a mirror

20:14.500 --> 20:17.280
 or you have a conversation or treat other people.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.740
 First of all, babies treat other people as others

20:20.660 --> 20:25.660
 far earlier than we have traditionally given them credit for.

20:25.780 --> 20:29.120
 And they certainly do it before they have language, right?

20:29.120 --> 20:33.940
 So it's got to proceed language to some degree.

20:33.940 --> 20:36.760
 And I mean, you can interrogate this for yourself

20:36.760 --> 20:40.340
 because you can put yourself in various states

20:40.340 --> 20:44.780
 that are rather obviously not linguistic.

20:46.340 --> 20:48.780
 Meditation allows you to do this.

20:48.780 --> 20:50.520
 You can certainly do it with psychedelics

20:50.520 --> 20:54.140
 where it's just your capacity for language

20:54.140 --> 20:58.820
 has been obliterated and yet you're all too conscious.

20:58.820 --> 21:03.820
 In fact, I think you could make a stronger argument

21:05.660 --> 21:09.580
 for things running the other way,

21:09.580 --> 21:14.480
 that there's something about language and conceptual thought

21:14.480 --> 21:18.160
 that is eliminative of conscious experience,

21:18.160 --> 21:23.160
 that we're potentially much more conscious of data,

21:23.840 --> 21:26.860
 sense data and everything else than we tend to be,

21:26.860 --> 21:29.220
 and we have trimmed it down

21:29.220 --> 21:33.640
 based on how we have acquired concepts.

21:33.640 --> 21:36.780
 And so like, when I walk into a room like this,

21:36.780 --> 21:38.780
 I know I'm walking into a room,

21:38.780 --> 21:41.980
 I have certain expectations of what is in a room.

21:41.980 --> 21:45.560
 I would be very surprised to see wild animals in here

21:45.560 --> 21:50.560
 or a waterfall or there are things I'm not expecting,

21:51.020 --> 21:53.580
 but I can know I'm not expecting them

21:53.580 --> 21:54.860
 or I'm expecting their absence

21:54.860 --> 21:57.380
 because of my capacity to be surprised

21:57.380 --> 22:01.800
 once I walk into a room and I see a live gorilla or whatever.

22:01.800 --> 22:05.900
 So there's structure there that we have put in place

22:05.900 --> 22:08.940
 based on all of our conceptual learning

22:08.940 --> 22:11.420
 and language learning.

22:11.420 --> 22:15.060
 And it causes us not to,

22:15.060 --> 22:17.380
 and one of the things that happens when you take psychedelics

22:17.380 --> 22:21.740
 and you just look as though for the first time at anything,

22:21.740 --> 22:26.740
 it becomes incredibly overloaded with,

22:27.120 --> 22:28.580
 it can become overloaded with meaning

22:28.580 --> 22:33.580
 and just the torrents of sense data that are coming in

22:37.220 --> 22:39.120
 in even the most ordinary circumstances

22:39.120 --> 22:40.780
 can become overwhelming for people.

22:40.780 --> 22:45.620
 And that tends to just obliterate one's capacity

22:45.620 --> 22:47.820
 to capture any of it linguistically.

22:47.820 --> 22:49.460
 And as you're coming down, right?

22:49.460 --> 22:50.540
 Have you done psychedelics?

22:50.540 --> 22:52.220
 Have you ever done acid or?

22:52.220 --> 22:55.680
 Not acid, mushroom, and that's it.

22:55.680 --> 22:58.500
 And also edibles,

22:58.500 --> 23:01.180
 but there's some psychedelic properties to them.

23:01.180 --> 23:04.900
 But yeah, mushrooms several times

23:04.900 --> 23:06.860
 and always had an incredible experience.

23:06.860 --> 23:09.420
 Exactly the kind of experience you're referring to,

23:09.420 --> 23:14.180
 which is if it's true that language constrains

23:14.180 --> 23:15.380
 our experience,

23:15.380 --> 23:19.600
 it felt like I was removing some of the constraints.

23:19.600 --> 23:21.540
 Because even just the most basic things

23:21.540 --> 23:22.720
 were beautiful in the way

23:22.720 --> 23:25.260
 that I wasn't able to appreciate previously,

23:25.260 --> 23:27.420
 like trees and nature and so on.

23:27.420 --> 23:30.660
 Yeah, and the experience of coming down

23:31.620 --> 23:36.620
 is an experience of encountering the futility

23:37.600 --> 23:42.600
 of capturing what you just saw a moment ago in words.

23:44.020 --> 23:47.700
 Especially if you have any part of your self concept

23:47.700 --> 23:50.740
 and your ego program is to be able

23:50.740 --> 23:51.980
 to capture things in words.

23:51.980 --> 23:55.660
 And if you're a writer or a poet or a scientist

23:55.660 --> 23:58.540
 or someone who wants to just encapsulate

23:58.540 --> 24:01.020
 the profundity of what just happened,

24:01.900 --> 24:06.900
 the total fatuousness of that enterprise

24:08.780 --> 24:12.660
 when you have taken a whopping dose of psychedelics

24:12.660 --> 24:17.660
 and you begin to even gesture at describing it to yourself,

24:19.700 --> 24:22.500
 so that you could describe it to others.

24:22.500 --> 24:26.500
 It's just, it's like trying to thread a needle

24:26.500 --> 24:27.540
 using your elbows.

24:27.540 --> 24:30.180
 I mean, it's like you're trying something that can't,

24:30.180 --> 24:34.780
 it's like the mere gesture proves it's impossibility.

24:34.780 --> 24:39.780
 And it's, so yeah, for me that suggests just empirically

24:39.780 --> 24:41.700
 on the first person side that it's possible

24:41.700 --> 24:43.340
 to put yourself in a condition

24:43.340 --> 24:47.460
 where it's clearly not about language

24:47.460 --> 24:49.820
 structuring your experience

24:49.820 --> 24:53.980
 and you're having much more experience than you tend to.

24:53.980 --> 24:57.780
 So the primacy of, language is primary for some things,

24:57.780 --> 25:02.780
 but it's certainly primary for certain kinds of concepts

25:04.780 --> 25:07.580
 and certain kinds of semantic understanding

25:07.580 --> 25:11.180
 and certain kinds of semantic understandings of the world.

25:11.180 --> 25:16.180
 But it's clearly more to mine than the conversation

25:17.700 --> 25:21.420
 we're having with ourselves or that we can have with others.

25:21.420 --> 25:25.900
 Can we go to that world of psychedelics for a bit?

25:25.900 --> 25:27.220
 Sure.

25:27.220 --> 25:30.500
 What do you think, so Joe Rogan apparently

25:30.500 --> 25:37.500
 and many others meet apparently elves on DMT, a lot of people

25:38.900 --> 25:41.540
 report this kind of creatures that they see.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.580
 And again, it's probably the failure of language

25:43.580 --> 25:46.860
 to describe that experience, but DMT is an interesting one.

25:46.860 --> 25:50.180
 There's, as you're aware, there's a bunch of studies

25:50.180 --> 25:54.180
 going on in psychedelics, currently MDMA, psilocybin

25:54.180 --> 25:59.180
 and John Hopkins and much other places, but DMT,

26:03.180 --> 26:08.180
 they all speak of as like some extra super level

26:08.780 --> 26:09.740
 of a psychedelic.

26:09.740 --> 26:13.100
 Yeah, do you have a sense of where it is our mind goes

26:16.940 --> 26:20.100
 on psychedelics, but in DMT especially?

26:20.100 --> 26:22.580
 Well, unfortunately I haven't taken DMT.

26:22.580 --> 26:23.900
 Unfortunately or fortunately?

26:23.900 --> 26:24.860
 Unfortunately.

26:24.860 --> 26:26.300
 Unfortunately.

26:26.300 --> 26:28.140
 Although it's, I presume it's in my body

26:28.140 --> 26:33.140
 as it is in everyone's brain and many, many plants

26:33.260 --> 26:36.860
 apparently, but I've wanted to take it.

26:36.860 --> 26:39.140
 I haven't been, I had an opportunity that was presented

26:39.140 --> 26:41.380
 itself that where it was obviously the right thing

26:41.380 --> 26:45.740
 for me to be doing, but for those who don't know,

26:45.740 --> 26:49.500
 DMT is often touted as the most intense psychedelic

26:49.500 --> 26:51.420
 and also the shortest acting.

26:51.420 --> 26:54.140
 I mean, you smoke it and it's basically a 10 minute

26:54.140 --> 26:57.820
 experience or a three minute experience within like

26:57.820 --> 27:02.300
 a 10 minute window that when you're really down

27:02.300 --> 27:07.300
 after 10 minutes or so, and Terrence McKenna

27:07.620 --> 27:09.460
 was a big proponent of DMT.

27:09.460 --> 27:12.260
 That was his, the center of the bullseye for him

27:12.260 --> 27:13.660
 psychedelically, apparently.

27:15.500 --> 27:20.060
 And it does, it is characterized, it seems for many people

27:20.060 --> 27:23.020
 by this phenomenon, which is unlike virtually

27:23.020 --> 27:25.900
 any other psychedelic experience, which is your,

27:25.900 --> 27:30.740
 it's not just your perception being broadened or changed.

27:30.740 --> 27:35.740
 It's you according to Terrence McKenna feeling fairly

27:36.380 --> 27:41.020
 unchanged, but catapulted into a different circumstance.

27:41.020 --> 27:45.580
 You and me have been shot elsewhere and find yourself

27:45.580 --> 27:49.020
 in relationship to other entities of some kind, right?

27:49.020 --> 27:52.060
 So the place is populated with things that seem

27:52.060 --> 27:54.140
 not to be your mind.

27:54.140 --> 27:56.260
 So it does feel like travel to another place

27:56.260 --> 27:58.180
 because you're unchanged yourself.

27:58.180 --> 28:00.460
 According, again, I just have this on the authority

28:00.460 --> 28:03.260
 of the people who have described their experience,

28:03.260 --> 28:05.580
 but it sounds like it's pretty common.

28:05.580 --> 28:07.060
 It sounds like it's pretty common for people

28:07.060 --> 28:09.860
 not to have the full experience because it's apparently

28:09.860 --> 28:11.620
 pretty unpleasant to smoke.

28:11.620 --> 28:15.220
 So it's like getting enough on board in order to get shot

28:15.220 --> 28:19.380
 out of the cannon and land among the,

28:20.740 --> 28:25.420
 what McKenna called self transforming machine elves

28:27.500 --> 28:30.780
 that appeared to him like jeweled Faberge egg,

28:30.780 --> 28:34.580
 like self drippling basketballs that were handing him

28:35.620 --> 28:39.500
 completely uninterpretable reams of profound knowledge.

28:41.340 --> 28:44.540
 It's an experience I haven't had.

28:44.540 --> 28:47.700
 So I just have to accept that people have had it.

28:49.380 --> 28:53.860
 I would just point out that our minds are clearly capable

28:53.860 --> 28:58.860
 of producing apparent others on demand

28:59.060 --> 29:01.940
 that are totally compelling to us, right?

29:01.940 --> 29:04.820
 There's no limit to our ability to do that

29:04.820 --> 29:08.260
 as anyone who's ever remembered a dream can attest.

29:08.260 --> 29:10.300
 Every night we go to sleep,

29:10.300 --> 29:11.900
 some of us don't remember dreams very often,

29:11.900 --> 29:15.660
 but some dream vividly every night.

29:15.660 --> 29:20.660
 And just think of how insane that experience is.

29:20.860 --> 29:23.900
 I mean, you've forgotten where you were, right?

29:23.900 --> 29:25.500
 That's the strangest part.

29:25.500 --> 29:27.940
 I mean, this is psychosis, right?

29:27.940 --> 29:29.500
 You have lost your mind.

29:29.500 --> 29:34.500
 You have lost your connection to your episodic memory

29:34.900 --> 29:39.900
 or even your expectations that reality won't undergo

29:39.900 --> 29:42.300
 wholesale changes a moment

29:42.300 --> 29:44.900
 after you have closed your eyes, right?

29:44.900 --> 29:49.140
 Like you're in bed, you're watching something on Netflix,

29:49.140 --> 29:50.420
 you're waiting to fall asleep,

29:50.420 --> 29:54.620
 and then the next thing that happens to you is impossible

29:54.620 --> 29:56.260
 and you're not surprised, right?

29:56.260 --> 29:57.540
 You're talking to dead people,

29:57.540 --> 29:58.920
 you're hanging out with famous people,

29:58.920 --> 30:02.860
 you're someplace you couldn't physically be,

30:02.860 --> 30:05.660
 you can fly and even that's not surprising, right?

30:05.660 --> 30:08.960
 So you've lost your mind,

30:08.960 --> 30:10.820
 but relevantly for this.

30:10.820 --> 30:12.220
 Or found it.

30:12.220 --> 30:13.060
 You found something.

30:13.060 --> 30:14.820
 I mean, lucid dreaming is very interesting

30:14.820 --> 30:17.940
 because then you can have the best of both circumstances

30:17.940 --> 30:22.940
 and then it can become systematically explored.

30:22.940 --> 30:25.420
 But what I mean by found, just to start to interrupt,

30:25.420 --> 30:29.060
 is like if we take this brilliant idea

30:29.060 --> 30:32.020
 that language constrains us, grounds us,

30:32.020 --> 30:35.620
 language and other things of the waking world ground us,

30:35.620 --> 30:39.780
 maybe it is that you've found the full capacity

30:41.580 --> 30:44.780
 of your cognition when you dream or when you do psychedelics.

30:44.780 --> 30:47.780
 You're stepping outside the little human cage,

30:47.780 --> 30:51.220
 the cage of the human condition to open the door

30:51.220 --> 30:54.260
 and step out and look around and then go back in.

30:54.260 --> 30:57.140
 Well, you've definitely stepped out of something

30:57.140 --> 30:59.260
 and into something else, but you've also lost something,

30:59.260 --> 31:01.180
 right, you've lost certain capacities.

31:01.180 --> 31:02.100
 Memory?

31:02.100 --> 31:04.140
 Well, just, yeah, in this case,

31:04.140 --> 31:08.020
 you literally didn't, you don't have enough presence of mind

31:08.020 --> 31:11.660
 in the dream state or even in the psychedelic state

31:11.660 --> 31:12.700
 if you take enough.

31:14.900 --> 31:15.740
 To do math.

31:15.740 --> 31:17.140
 There's no psychological,

31:17.140 --> 31:21.760
 there's very little psychological continuity with your life

31:21.760 --> 31:26.400
 such that you're not surprised to be in the presence

31:26.400 --> 31:30.180
 of someone who should be, you should know is dead

31:30.180 --> 31:32.620
 or you should know you're not likely to have met

31:32.620 --> 31:35.540
 by normal channels, right, you're now talking

31:35.540 --> 31:38.940
 to some celebrity and it turns out you're best friends,

31:38.940 --> 31:40.780
 right, and you're not even, you have no memory

31:40.780 --> 31:41.980
 of how you got there, you're like,

31:41.980 --> 31:42.940
 how did you get into the room?

31:42.940 --> 31:45.300
 You're like, did you drive to this restaurant?

31:45.300 --> 31:47.500
 You have no memory and none of that's surprising to you.

31:47.500 --> 31:49.740
 So you're kind of brain damaged in a way,

31:49.740 --> 31:53.440
 you're not reality testing in the normal way.

31:53.440 --> 31:56.420
 The fascinating possibility is that there's probably

31:56.420 --> 31:58.940
 thousands of people who've taken psychedelics

31:58.940 --> 32:03.580
 of various forms and have met Sam Harris on that journey.

32:03.580 --> 32:05.380
 Well, I would put it more likely in dreams,

32:05.380 --> 32:08.020
 not, you know, because with psychedelics,

32:08.020 --> 32:11.500
 you don't tend to hallucinate in a dreamlike way.

32:11.500 --> 32:15.580
 I mean, so DMT is giving you an experience of others,

32:15.580 --> 32:19.340
 but it seems to be nonstandard.

32:19.340 --> 32:23.000
 It's not like, it's not just like dream hallucinations,

32:23.000 --> 32:26.520
 but to the point of coming back to DMT,

32:26.520 --> 32:30.200
 the people want to suggest,

32:30.200 --> 32:32.280
 and Terrence McKenna certainly did suggest

32:32.280 --> 32:37.020
 that because these others are so obviously other

32:37.020 --> 32:39.760
 and they're so vivid, well, then they could not possibly

32:39.760 --> 32:42.840
 be the creation of my own mind,

32:42.840 --> 32:47.840
 but every night in dreams, you create a compelling

32:47.840 --> 32:49.780
 or what is to you at the time,

32:49.780 --> 32:54.000
 a totally compelling simulacrum of another person, right?

32:54.000 --> 32:59.000
 And that just proves the mind is capable of doing it.

33:00.960 --> 33:04.680
 Now, the phenomenon of lucid dreaming shows

33:04.680 --> 33:07.500
 that the mind isn't capable of doing everything you think

33:07.500 --> 33:10.040
 it might be capable of even in that space.

33:10.040 --> 33:14.280
 So one of the things that people have discovered

33:14.280 --> 33:17.480
 in lucid dreams, and I haven't done a lot of lucid dreaming,

33:17.480 --> 33:24.480
 so I can't confirm all of this, I can confirm some of it.

33:24.480 --> 33:28.200
 Apparently in every house, in every room

33:28.200 --> 33:30.400
 in the mansion of dreams,

33:30.400 --> 33:32.840
 all light switches are dimmer switches.

33:32.840 --> 33:36.040
 Like if you go into a dark room and flip on the light,

33:36.040 --> 33:38.000
 it gradually comes up.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.400
 It doesn't come up instantly on demand

33:41.400 --> 33:44.660
 because apparently this is covering for the brain's

33:44.660 --> 33:49.480
 inability to produce from a standing start

33:49.480 --> 33:52.160
 visually rich imagery on demand.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.640
 So I haven't confirmed that, but that was,

33:54.640 --> 33:57.960
 people have done research on lucid dreaming claim

33:57.960 --> 33:59.820
 that it's all dimmer switches.

34:01.360 --> 34:03.040
 But one thing I have noticed,

34:03.040 --> 34:08.040
 and people can check this out, is that in a dream,

34:08.520 --> 34:13.520
 if you look at text, a page of text or a sign

34:13.520 --> 34:16.280
 or a television that has text on it,

34:16.280 --> 34:18.800
 and then you turn away and you look back at that text,

34:18.800 --> 34:21.600
 the text will have changed, right?

34:21.600 --> 34:24.440
 The total is it's just a chronic instability,

34:24.440 --> 34:28.900
 graphical instability of text in the dream state.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.120
 And I don't know if that, maybe that's,

34:31.120 --> 34:33.200
 someone can confirm that that's not true for them,

34:33.200 --> 34:34.960
 but whenever I've checked that out,

34:34.960 --> 34:35.800
 that has been true for me.

34:35.800 --> 34:39.040
 So it keeps generating it like real time

34:39.040 --> 34:40.640
 from a video game perspective.

34:40.640 --> 34:44.760
 Yeah, it's rendering, it's re rendering it for some reason.

34:44.760 --> 34:46.000
 What's interesting, I actually,

34:46.000 --> 34:49.180
 I don't know how I found myself in this sets

34:49.180 --> 34:51.800
 of that part of the internet,

34:51.800 --> 34:53.780
 but there's quite a lot of discussion

34:53.780 --> 34:56.400
 about what it's like to do math on LSD.

34:57.360 --> 35:02.360
 Because apparently one of the deepest thinking processes

35:02.360 --> 35:04.700
 needed is those of mathematicians

35:04.700 --> 35:06.040
 or theoretical computer scientists

35:06.040 --> 35:08.480
 are basically doing anything that involves math

35:08.480 --> 35:11.180
 as proofs, and you have to think creatively,

35:11.180 --> 35:13.200
 but also deeply, and you have to think

35:13.200 --> 35:15.880
 for many hours at a time.

35:15.880 --> 35:18.560
 And so they're always looking for ways to like,

35:18.560 --> 35:22.280
 is there any sparks of creativity that could be injected?

35:22.280 --> 35:25.600
 And apparently out of all the psychedelics,

35:25.600 --> 35:29.320
 the worst is LSD because it completely destroys

35:29.320 --> 35:31.040
 your ability to do math well.

35:31.040 --> 35:33.680
 And I wonder whether that has to do with your ability

35:33.680 --> 35:38.460
 to visualize geometric things in a stable way

35:38.460 --> 35:40.120
 in your mind and hold them there

35:40.120 --> 35:41.640
 and stitch things together,

35:41.640 --> 35:44.100
 which is often what's required for proofs.

35:44.100 --> 35:47.980
 But again, it's difficult to kind of research

35:47.980 --> 35:51.000
 these kinds of concepts, but it does make me wonder

35:51.000 --> 35:56.000
 where, what are the spaces, how's the space of things

35:56.400 --> 35:59.120
 you're able to think about and explore

35:59.120 --> 36:02.840
 morphed by different psychedelics

36:02.840 --> 36:06.120
 or dream states and so on, and how's that different?

36:06.120 --> 36:08.040
 How much does it overlap with reality?

36:08.040 --> 36:10.400
 And what is reality?

36:10.400 --> 36:12.320
 Is there a waking state reality?

36:13.360 --> 36:15.920
 Or is it just a tiny subset of reality

36:15.920 --> 36:18.940
 and we get to take a step in other versions of it?

36:18.940 --> 36:23.000
 We tend to think very much in a space time,

36:23.000 --> 36:25.680
 four dimensional, there's a three dimensional world,

36:25.680 --> 36:29.640
 there's time, and that's what we think about reality.

36:29.640 --> 36:33.640
 And we think of traveling as walking from point A

36:33.640 --> 36:36.740
 to point B in the three dimensional world.

36:36.740 --> 36:40.120
 But that's a very kind of human surviving,

36:40.120 --> 36:43.400
 trying not to get eaten by a lion conception of reality.

36:43.400 --> 36:46.840
 What if traveling is something like we do with psychedelics

36:46.840 --> 36:48.360
 and meet the elves?

36:48.360 --> 36:50.600
 What if it's something, what if thinking

36:50.600 --> 36:53.820
 or the space of ideas as we kind of grow

36:53.820 --> 36:56.440
 and think through ideas, that's traveling?

36:57.740 --> 37:00.380
 Or what if memories is traveling?

37:00.380 --> 37:03.980
 I don't know if you have a favorite view of reality

37:03.980 --> 37:06.980
 or if you had, by the way, I should say,

37:06.980 --> 37:09.380
 excellent conversation with Donald Hoffman.

37:10.420 --> 37:11.980
 Yeah, yeah, he's interesting.

37:11.980 --> 37:15.980
 Is there any inkling of his sense in your mind

37:15.980 --> 37:20.220
 that reality is very far from,

37:20.220 --> 37:22.300
 actual like objective reality is very far

37:22.300 --> 37:24.980
 from the kind of reality we imagine,

37:24.980 --> 37:29.440
 we perceive and we play with in our human minds?

37:29.440 --> 37:31.520
 Well, the first thing to grant

37:31.520 --> 37:36.520
 is that we're never in direct contact with reality,

37:39.680 --> 37:42.840
 whatever it is, unless that reality is consciousness, right?

37:42.840 --> 37:47.320
 So we're only ever experiencing consciousness

37:47.320 --> 37:48.420
 and its contents.

37:48.420 --> 37:53.140
 And then the question is how does that circumstance relate

37:53.140 --> 37:55.980
 to quote reality at large?

37:55.980 --> 38:00.160
 And Donald Hoffman is somebody who's happy to speculate,

38:00.160 --> 38:02.700
 well, maybe there isn't a reality at large.

38:02.700 --> 38:05.620
 Maybe it's all just consciousness on some level.

38:05.620 --> 38:08.340
 And that's interesting.

38:08.340 --> 38:13.340
 That runs into, to my eye, various philosophical problems

38:15.260 --> 38:17.580
 that, or at least you have to do a lot,

38:17.580 --> 38:22.580
 you have to add to that picture of idealism for me.

38:24.820 --> 38:27.460
 That's usually all the whole family of views

38:27.460 --> 38:30.580
 that would just say that the universe is just mind

38:30.580 --> 38:32.940
 or just consciousness at bottom,

38:32.940 --> 38:36.040
 we'll go by the name of idealism in Western philosophy.

38:38.300 --> 38:40.940
 You have to add to that idealistic picture

38:40.940 --> 38:44.860
 all kinds of epicycles and kind of weird coincidences

38:44.860 --> 38:49.860
 and to get the predictability of our experience

38:51.300 --> 38:54.400
 and the success of materialist science

38:54.400 --> 38:56.100
 to make sense in that context, right?

38:56.100 --> 39:00.700
 And so the fact that we can, what does it mean to say

39:00.700 --> 39:05.580
 that there's only consciousness at bottom, right?

39:05.580 --> 39:07.100
 Nothing outside of consciousness

39:07.100 --> 39:08.620
 because no one's ever experienced anything

39:08.620 --> 39:09.540
 outside of consciousness.

39:09.540 --> 39:11.740
 There's no scientist has ever done an experiment

39:11.740 --> 39:14.920
 where they were contemplating data,

39:14.920 --> 39:17.460
 no matter how far removed from our sense bases,

39:17.460 --> 39:20.620
 whether it's they're looking at the Hubble deep field

39:20.620 --> 39:25.620
 or they're smashing atoms or whatever tools they're using,

39:25.620 --> 39:29.020
 they're still just experiencing consciousness

39:29.020 --> 39:32.940
 and its various deliverances

39:32.940 --> 39:37.220
 and layering their concepts on top of that.

39:37.220 --> 39:41.540
 So that's always true.

39:41.540 --> 39:44.740
 And yet that somehow doesn't seem to capture

39:48.340 --> 39:53.340
 the character of our continually discovering

39:53.340 --> 39:58.340
 that our materialist assumptions are confirmable, right?

39:59.000 --> 40:03.360
 So take the fact that we unleash this fantastic amount

40:03.360 --> 40:06.400
 of energy from within an atom, right?

40:06.400 --> 40:09.920
 First, we have the theoretical suggestion

40:09.920 --> 40:12.240
 that it's possible, right?

40:12.240 --> 40:14.160
 We come back to Einstein,

40:14.160 --> 40:18.560
 there's a lot of energy in that matter, right?

40:18.560 --> 40:21.020
 And what if we could release it, right?

40:21.020 --> 40:24.720
 And then we perform an experiment that in this case,

40:24.720 --> 40:28.560
 you know, the Trinity test site in New Mexico,

40:28.560 --> 40:32.000
 where the people who are most adequate to this conversation,

40:32.000 --> 40:33.760
 people like Robert Oppenheimer

40:36.800 --> 40:38.020
 are standing around,

40:38.020 --> 40:41.000
 not altogether certain it's going to work, right?

40:41.000 --> 40:42.120
 They're performing an experiment.

40:42.120 --> 40:43.240
 They're wondering what's gonna happen.

40:43.240 --> 40:45.640
 They're wondering if their calculations around the yield

40:45.640 --> 40:47.680
 are off by orders of magnitude.

40:47.680 --> 40:49.100
 Some of them are still wondering

40:49.100 --> 40:51.840
 whether the entire atmosphere of earth

40:51.840 --> 40:55.360
 is gonna combust, right?

40:55.360 --> 40:59.400
 That the nuclear chain reaction is not gonna stop.

41:01.200 --> 41:04.480
 And lo and behold,

41:04.480 --> 41:07.720
 there was that energy to be released

41:07.720 --> 41:09.840
 from within the nucleus of an atom.

41:09.840 --> 41:14.840
 And that could, so it's just what the picture one forms

41:14.840 --> 41:17.080
 from those kinds of experiments.

41:17.080 --> 41:17.920
 And just the knowledge,

41:17.920 --> 41:19.440
 it's just our understanding of evolution.

41:19.440 --> 41:22.720
 Just the fact that the earth is billions of years old

41:22.720 --> 41:24.520
 and life is hundreds of millions of years old.

41:24.520 --> 41:27.720
 And we weren't here to think about any of those things.

41:28.680 --> 41:30.520
 And all of those processes were happening therefore

41:30.520 --> 41:31.880
 in the dark.

41:31.880 --> 41:35.360
 And they are the processes that allowed us to emerge,

41:35.360 --> 41:38.560
 you know, from prior life forms in the first place.

41:38.560 --> 41:40.440
 To say that it's all a mess,

41:40.440 --> 41:42.160
 that nothing exists,

41:42.160 --> 41:45.080
 outside of consciousness, conscious minds

41:45.080 --> 41:47.600
 of the sort that we experience.

41:47.600 --> 41:48.920
 It just seems,

41:50.640 --> 41:55.640
 it seems like a bizarrely anthropocentric claim,

41:58.200 --> 41:59.720
 you know, analogous to, you know,

41:59.720 --> 42:02.400
 the moon isn't there if no one's looking at it, right?

42:02.400 --> 42:04.760
 I mean, the moon as a moon isn't there

42:04.760 --> 42:05.600
 if no one's looking at it.

42:05.600 --> 42:06.440
 I'll grant that,

42:06.440 --> 42:09.520
 because that's already a kind of fabrication

42:09.520 --> 42:13.360
 born of concepts, but the idea that there's nothing there,

42:13.360 --> 42:15.760
 that there's nothing that corresponds

42:15.760 --> 42:18.000
 to what we experience as the moon,

42:18.000 --> 42:19.800
 unless someone's looking at it,

42:19.800 --> 42:24.800
 that just seems just a way too parochial way

42:25.440 --> 42:27.560
 to set out on this journey of discovery.

42:27.560 --> 42:28.400
 There is something there.

42:28.400 --> 42:30.440
 There's a computer waiting to render the moon

42:30.440 --> 42:32.000
 when you look at it.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.840
 The capacity for the moon to exist is there.

42:34.840 --> 42:36.960
 So if we're looking at the moon,

42:36.960 --> 42:39.640
 the capacity for the moon to exist is there.

42:39.640 --> 42:43.520
 So if we're indeed living in a simulation,

42:43.520 --> 42:46.440
 which I find a compelling thought experiment,

42:46.440 --> 42:50.440
 it's possible that there is this kind of rendering mechanism,

42:50.440 --> 42:53.400
 but not in a silly way that we think about in video games,

42:53.400 --> 42:56.400
 but in some kind of more fundamental physics way.

42:56.400 --> 42:58.800
 And we have to account for the fact

42:58.800 --> 43:03.800
 that it renders experiences that no one has had yet,

43:03.800 --> 43:07.160
 that no one has any expectation of having.

43:07.160 --> 43:10.320
 It can violate the expectations of everyone lawfully.

43:10.320 --> 43:12.200
 And then there's some lawful understanding

43:12.200 --> 43:14.240
 of why that's so.

43:14.240 --> 43:18.320
 It's like, I mean, just to bring it back to mathematics,

43:18.320 --> 43:20.440
 I'm like, certain numbers are prime,

43:20.440 --> 43:22.720
 whether we have discovered them or not.

43:22.720 --> 43:27.640
 There's the highest prime number that anyone can name now.

43:27.640 --> 43:29.200
 And then there's the next prime number

43:29.200 --> 43:31.680
 that no one can name, and it's there.

43:31.680 --> 43:36.600
 So it's like, to say that our minds are putting it there,

43:36.600 --> 43:38.920
 that what we know as mind in ourselves

43:38.920 --> 43:41.400
 is in some way, in some sense, putting it there.

43:43.360 --> 43:47.280
 The base layer of reality is consciousness, right?

43:47.280 --> 43:49.560
 That we're identical to the thing

43:49.560 --> 43:53.280
 that is rendering this reality.

43:53.280 --> 43:57.760
 There's some, you know, hubris is the wrong word,

43:57.760 --> 44:01.760
 but it's like, it's okay if reality is bigger

44:01.760 --> 44:03.320
 than what we experience, you know?

44:03.320 --> 44:08.200
 And it has structure that we can't anticipate,

44:08.200 --> 44:09.600
 and that isn't just,

44:13.560 --> 44:16.720
 I mean, again, there's certainly a collaboration

44:16.720 --> 44:19.640
 between our minds and whatever is out there

44:19.640 --> 44:24.080
 to produce what we call, you know, the stuff of life.

44:24.080 --> 44:29.080
 But it's not, the idea that it's,

44:31.000 --> 44:33.280
 I don't know, I mean, there are a few stops

44:33.280 --> 44:36.920
 on the train of idealism and kind of new age thinking

44:36.920 --> 44:40.600
 and Eastern philosophy that I don't,

44:40.600 --> 44:42.520
 philosophically, I don't see a need to take.

44:42.520 --> 44:45.960
 I mean, experientially and scientifically,

44:45.960 --> 44:49.520
 I feel like it's, you can get everything you want

44:49.520 --> 44:53.520
 from acknowledging that consciousness

44:53.520 --> 44:58.520
 has a character that can be explored from its own side,

44:58.920 --> 45:01.600
 so that you're bringing kind of the first person experience

45:01.600 --> 45:03.960
 back into the conversation about, you know,

45:03.960 --> 45:06.800
 what is a human mind and, you know, what is true?

45:08.000 --> 45:12.040
 And you can explore it with different degrees of rigor,

45:12.040 --> 45:13.680
 and there are things to be discovered there,

45:13.680 --> 45:15.480
 whether you're using a technique like meditation

45:15.480 --> 45:19.000
 or psychedelics, and that these experiences

45:19.000 --> 45:22.520
 have to be put in conversation with what we understand

45:22.520 --> 45:24.600
 about ourselves from a third person side,

45:24.600 --> 45:27.440
 neuroscientifically or in any other way.

45:27.440 --> 45:30.320
 But to me, the question is, what if reality,

45:30.320 --> 45:34.840
 the sense I have from this kind of, you play shooters?

45:34.840 --> 45:36.040
 No.

45:36.040 --> 45:38.240
 There's a physics engine that generates, that's pretty.

45:38.240 --> 45:40.320
 Yeah, you mean first person shooter games?

45:40.320 --> 45:41.800
 Yes, yes, sorry.

45:41.800 --> 45:43.600
 Not often, but yes.

45:43.600 --> 45:44.760
 I mean, there's a physics engine

45:44.760 --> 45:47.320
 that generates consistent reality, right?

45:47.320 --> 45:50.920
 My sense is the same could be true for a universe

45:51.840 --> 45:54.720
 in the following sense, that our conception of reality

45:54.720 --> 45:57.640
 as we understand it now in the 21st century

45:57.640 --> 45:59.760
 is a tiny subset of the full reality.

45:59.760 --> 46:03.000
 It's not that the reality that we conceive of that's there,

46:03.000 --> 46:06.440
 the moon being there is not there somehow.

46:06.440 --> 46:09.400
 It's that it's a tiny fraction of what's actually out there.

46:09.400 --> 46:12.840
 And so the physics engine of the universe

46:12.840 --> 46:16.120
 is just maintaining the useful physics,

46:16.120 --> 46:19.840
 the useful reality, quote unquote,

46:19.840 --> 46:22.880
 for us to have a consistent experience as human beings.

46:22.880 --> 46:27.880
 But maybe we descendants of apes are really only understand

46:27.920 --> 46:32.920
 like 0.0001% of actual physics of reality.

46:34.040 --> 46:36.600
 We can even just start with the consciousness thing,

46:36.600 --> 46:39.520
 but maybe our minds are just,

46:39.520 --> 46:42.320
 we're just too dumb by design.

46:42.320 --> 46:46.800
 Yeah, I, that truly resonates with me

46:46.800 --> 46:48.320
 and I'm surprised it doesn't resonate more

46:48.320 --> 46:50.960
 with most scientists that I talk to.

46:50.960 --> 46:52.840
 Matthew, when you just look at,

46:52.840 --> 46:57.200
 you look at how close we are to chimps, right?

46:57.200 --> 46:58.920
 And chimps don't know anything, right?

46:58.920 --> 47:01.240
 Clearly they have no idea what's going on, right?

47:01.240 --> 47:03.280
 And then you get us,

47:03.280 --> 47:06.160
 but then it's only a subset of human beings

47:06.160 --> 47:09.880
 that really understand much of what we're talking about

47:09.880 --> 47:12.640
 in any area of specialization.

47:12.640 --> 47:15.680
 And if they all died in their sleep tonight, right?

47:15.680 --> 47:20.640
 You'd be left with people who might take a thousand years

47:20.640 --> 47:24.640
 to rebuild the internet, if ever, right?

47:24.640 --> 47:26.200
 I mean, literally it's like,

47:26.200 --> 47:29.280
 and I would extend this to myself.

47:29.280 --> 47:32.920
 I mean, there are areas of scientific specialization

47:32.920 --> 47:37.480
 where I have either no discernible competence.

47:37.480 --> 47:40.040
 I mean, I spent no time on it.

47:40.040 --> 47:42.120
 I have not acquired the tools.

47:42.120 --> 47:43.960
 It would just be an article of faith for me to think

47:43.960 --> 47:45.120
 that I could acquire the tools

47:45.120 --> 47:47.400
 to actually make a breakthrough in those areas.

47:48.400 --> 47:50.520
 And I mean, your own area is one.

47:50.520 --> 47:54.080
 I mean, I've never spent any significant amount of time

47:54.080 --> 47:56.400
 trying to be a programmer,

47:56.400 --> 48:00.360
 but it's pretty obvious I'm not Alan Turing, right?

48:00.360 --> 48:03.760
 It's like, if that were my capacity,

48:03.760 --> 48:05.840
 I would have discovered that in myself.

48:05.840 --> 48:08.360
 I would have found programming irresistible.

48:08.360 --> 48:13.360
 My first false starts in learning, I think it was C,

48:15.080 --> 48:17.280
 it was just, you know, I bounced off.

48:17.280 --> 48:18.360
 It's like, this was not fun.

48:18.360 --> 48:20.200
 I hate, I mean, I hate trying to figure out

48:20.200 --> 48:22.960
 what the syntax error that's causing this thing

48:22.960 --> 48:25.760
 not to compile was just a fucking awful experience.

48:25.760 --> 48:26.600
 I hated it, right?

48:26.600 --> 48:28.000
 I hated every minute of it.

48:28.000 --> 48:33.000
 So it was not, so if it was just people like me left,

48:33.000 --> 48:35.840
 like when do we get the internet again, right?

48:35.840 --> 48:39.000
 And we lose, we lose, you know, we lose the internet.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
 When do we get it again, right?

48:40.000 --> 48:44.040
 When do we get anything like a proper science

48:44.040 --> 48:45.600
 of information, right?

48:45.600 --> 48:49.280
 You need a Claude Shannon or an Alan Turing

48:49.280 --> 48:52.120
 to plant a flag in the ground right here and say,

48:52.120 --> 48:53.440
 all right, can everyone see this?

48:53.440 --> 48:56.080
 Even if you don't quite know what I'm up to,

48:56.080 --> 49:00.440
 you all have to come over here to make some progress.

49:00.440 --> 49:03.000
 And, you know, there are, you know,

49:03.000 --> 49:05.640
 hundreds of topics where that's the case.

49:05.640 --> 49:10.640
 So we barely have a purchase on making anything

49:10.800 --> 49:15.800
 like discernible intellectual progress in any generation.

49:16.120 --> 49:21.120
 And yeah, I'm just, Max Tegmark makes this point.

49:21.600 --> 49:25.800
 He's one of the few people who does in physics.

49:26.800 --> 49:28.840
 If you just look at the numbers,

49:28.840 --> 49:33.840
 if you just take the truth of evolution seriously, right?

49:36.360 --> 49:39.800
 And realize that there's nothing about us

49:39.800 --> 49:42.760
 that has evolved to understand reality perfectly.

49:42.760 --> 49:46.360
 I mean, we're just not that kind of ape, right?

49:46.360 --> 49:48.640
 There's been no evolutionary pressure along those lines.

49:48.640 --> 49:52.400
 So what we are making do with tools

49:52.400 --> 49:56.060
 that were designed for fights with sticks and rocks, right?

49:56.060 --> 50:00.420
 And it's amazing we can do as much as we can.

50:00.420 --> 50:02.380
 I mean, we just, you know, the UNR just sitting here

50:02.380 --> 50:05.780
 on the back of having received an mRNA vaccine,

50:05.780 --> 50:08.460
 you know, that has certainly changed our life

50:08.460 --> 50:10.620
 given what the last year was like.

50:10.620 --> 50:12.180
 And it's gonna change the world

50:12.180 --> 50:16.460
 if rumors of coming miracles are born out.

50:16.460 --> 50:20.780
 I mean, it's now, it seems likely we have a vaccine

50:20.780 --> 50:22.240
 coming for malaria, right?

50:22.240 --> 50:25.920
 Which has been killing millions of people a year

50:25.920 --> 50:28.420
 for as long as we've been alive.

50:28.420 --> 50:31.260
 I think it's down to like 800,000 people a year now

50:31.260 --> 50:33.900
 because we've spread so many bed nets around,

50:33.900 --> 50:37.360
 but it was like two and a half million people every year.

50:39.340 --> 50:43.380
 It's amazing what we can do, but yeah, I have,

50:43.380 --> 50:46.820
 if in fact the answer at the back of the book of nature

50:46.820 --> 50:51.820
 is you understand 0.1% of what there is to understand

50:52.100 --> 50:54.900
 and half of what you think you understand is wrong,

50:54.900 --> 50:57.300
 that would not surprise me at all.

50:58.420 --> 51:01.020
 It is funny to look at our evolutionary history,

51:01.020 --> 51:03.620
 even back to chimps, I'm pretty sure even chimps

51:03.620 --> 51:06.340
 thought they understood the world well.

51:06.340 --> 51:09.300
 So at every point in that timeline

51:09.300 --> 51:12.860
 of evolutionary development throughout human history,

51:12.860 --> 51:15.560
 there's a sense like there's no more,

51:15.560 --> 51:17.020
 you hear this message over and over,

51:17.020 --> 51:19.380
 there's no more things to be invented.

51:19.380 --> 51:21.300
 But a hundred years ago there were,

51:21.300 --> 51:24.940
 there's a famous story, I forget which physicist told it,

51:24.940 --> 51:29.060
 but there were physicists telling

51:29.060 --> 51:32.820
 their undergraduate students not to go into,

51:32.820 --> 51:34.260
 to get graduate degrees in physics

51:34.260 --> 51:36.580
 because basically all the problems had been solved.

51:36.580 --> 51:40.140
 And this is like around 1915 or so.

51:40.140 --> 51:41.300
 It turns out you were right.

51:41.300 --> 51:42.720
 I'm gonna ask you about free will.

51:42.720 --> 51:43.560
 Oh, okay.

51:44.820 --> 51:48.240
 You've recently released an episode of your podcast,

51:48.240 --> 51:51.580
 Making Sense, for those with a shorter attention span,

51:51.580 --> 51:54.000
 basically summarizing your position on free will.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.240
 I think it was under an hour and a half.

51:56.240 --> 51:57.080
 Yeah, yeah.

51:57.080 --> 52:00.520
 It was brief and clear.

52:01.820 --> 52:05.300
 So allow me to summarize the summary, TLDR,

52:05.300 --> 52:07.380
 and maybe you tell me where I'm wrong.

52:08.380 --> 52:11.380
 So free will is an illusion,

52:11.380 --> 52:13.980
 and even the experience of free will is an illusion.

52:13.980 --> 52:15.940
 Like we don't even experience it.

52:15.940 --> 52:19.940
 Am I good in my summary?

52:20.860 --> 52:25.500
 Yeah, this is a line that's a little hard

52:25.500 --> 52:27.360
 to scan for people.

52:27.360 --> 52:32.340
 I say that it's not merely that free will is an illusion.

52:32.340 --> 52:35.100
 The illusion of free will is an illusion.

52:35.100 --> 52:37.460
 Like there is no illusion of free will.

52:37.460 --> 52:40.620
 And that is a, unlike many other illusions,

52:40.620 --> 52:45.620
 that's a more fundamental claim.

52:47.100 --> 52:49.500
 It's not that it's wrong, it's not even wrong.

52:49.500 --> 52:52.200
 I mean, I guess that was I think Wolfgang Pauli

52:52.200 --> 52:56.380
 who derided one of his colleagues or enemies

52:56.380 --> 53:01.380
 with that aspersion about his theory in quantum mechanics.

53:06.860 --> 53:09.780
 So there are things that, there are genuine illusions.

53:09.780 --> 53:12.700
 There are things that you do experience

53:12.700 --> 53:15.120
 and then you can kind of punch through that experience,

53:15.120 --> 53:17.300
 or you can't actually experience,

53:17.300 --> 53:20.100
 you can't experience them any other way.

53:20.100 --> 53:24.060
 It's just, we just know it's not a veridical experience.

53:24.060 --> 53:25.340
 You just take like a visual illusion.

53:25.340 --> 53:26.940
 There are visual illusions that,

53:26.940 --> 53:28.700
 a lot of these come to me on Twitter these days.

53:28.700 --> 53:31.000
 There's these amazing visual illusions

53:31.000 --> 53:36.000
 where like every figure in this GIF seems to be moving,

53:36.380 --> 53:37.700
 but nothing in fact is moving.

53:37.700 --> 53:39.180
 You can just like put a ruler on your screen

53:39.180 --> 53:40.220
 and nothing's moving.

53:42.260 --> 53:44.500
 Some of those illusions you can't see any other way.

53:44.500 --> 53:46.840
 I mean, they're just, they're hacking aspects

53:46.840 --> 53:49.860
 of the visual system that are just eminently hackable

53:49.860 --> 53:54.360
 and you have to use a ruler to convince yourself

53:54.360 --> 53:56.460
 that the thing isn't actually moving.

53:56.460 --> 53:57.840
 Now there are other visual illusions

53:57.840 --> 54:01.140
 where you're taken in by it at first,

54:01.140 --> 54:02.540
 but if you pay more attention,

54:02.540 --> 54:05.260
 you can actually see that it's not there, right?

54:05.260 --> 54:07.580
 Or it's not how it first seemed.

54:07.580 --> 54:10.160
 Like the Necker cube is a good example of that.

54:10.160 --> 54:13.260
 Like the Necker cube is just that schematic of a cube,

54:13.260 --> 54:15.900
 of a transparent cube, which pops out one way or the other.

54:15.900 --> 54:17.860
 Then one face can pop out and then the other face

54:17.860 --> 54:18.900
 can pop out.

54:18.900 --> 54:22.140
 But you can actually just see it as flat with no pop out,

54:22.140 --> 54:26.140
 which is a more veridical way of looking at it.

54:27.900 --> 54:29.900
 So there are subject,

54:29.900 --> 54:32.300
 there are kind of inward correlates to this.

54:32.300 --> 54:37.300
 And I would say that the sense of self and free will

54:39.700 --> 54:40.660
 are closely related.

54:40.660 --> 54:43.460
 I mean, I often describe them as two sides of the same coin,

54:43.460 --> 54:48.460
 but they're not quite the same in their spuriousness.

54:49.260 --> 54:52.420
 I mean, so the sense of self is something that people,

54:52.420 --> 54:54.560
 I think, do experience, right?

54:54.560 --> 54:58.340
 It's not a very clear experience, but it's not,

54:58.340 --> 55:00.920
 I wouldn't call the illusion of self an illusion,

55:00.920 --> 55:03.260
 but the illusion of free will is an illusion

55:03.260 --> 55:07.300
 in that as you pay more attention to your experience,

55:07.300 --> 55:10.500
 you begin to see that it's totally compatible

55:10.500 --> 55:11.800
 with an absence of free will.

55:11.800 --> 55:14.620
 You don't, I mean coming back to the place we started,

55:15.660 --> 55:18.460
 you don't know what you're gonna think next.

55:18.460 --> 55:20.300
 You don't know what you're gonna intend next.

55:20.300 --> 55:23.400
 You don't know what's going to just occur to you

55:23.400 --> 55:24.540
 that you must do next.

55:24.540 --> 55:28.020
 You don't know how much you are going to feel

55:28.020 --> 55:31.660
 the behavioral imperative to act on that thought.

55:31.660 --> 55:35.340
 If you suddenly feel, oh, I don't need to do that.

55:35.340 --> 55:36.740
 I can do that tomorrow.

55:36.740 --> 55:38.100
 You don't know where that comes from.

55:38.100 --> 55:39.620
 You didn't know that was gonna arise.

55:39.620 --> 55:41.580
 You didn't know that was gonna be compelling.

55:41.580 --> 55:44.140
 All of this is compatible with some evil genius

55:44.140 --> 55:47.980
 in the next room just typing in code into your experience.

55:47.980 --> 55:50.080
 It's like this, okay, let's give him the,

55:51.220 --> 55:53.940
 oh my God, I just forgot it was gonna be our anniversary

55:53.940 --> 55:56.060
 in one week thought, right?

55:56.060 --> 55:57.980
 Give him the cascade of fear.

55:59.060 --> 56:01.600
 Give him this brilliant idea for the thing he can buy

56:01.600 --> 56:02.860
 that's gonna take him no time at all

56:02.860 --> 56:05.300
 and this overpowering sense of relief.

56:05.300 --> 56:07.820
 All of our experiences is compatible

56:07.820 --> 56:11.700
 with the script already being written, right?

56:11.700 --> 56:12.980
 And I'm not saying the script is written.

56:12.980 --> 56:17.340
 I'm not saying that fatalism is the right way

56:17.340 --> 56:20.180
 to look at this, but we just don't have

56:20.180 --> 56:23.420
 even our most deliberate voluntary action

56:23.420 --> 56:27.060
 where we go back and forth between two options,

56:27.060 --> 56:28.580
 thinking about the reason for A

56:28.580 --> 56:30.480
 and then reconsidering and going,

56:31.740 --> 56:34.100
 thinking harder about B and just going

56:34.100 --> 56:37.980
 eeny, meeny, miny, moe until the end of the hour.

56:37.980 --> 56:40.320
 However laborious you can make it,

56:40.320 --> 56:44.500
 there is a utter mystery at your back

56:44.500 --> 56:48.940
 finally promoting the thought or intention

56:48.940 --> 56:53.860
 or rationale that is most compelling

56:53.860 --> 56:58.860
 and therefore behaviorally effective.

57:07.420 --> 57:09.280
 And this can drive some people a little crazy.

57:09.280 --> 57:13.740
 So I usually preface what I say about free will

57:13.740 --> 57:17.260
 with the caveat that if thinking about your mind this way

57:17.260 --> 57:19.820
 makes you feel terrible, well then stop.

57:19.820 --> 57:22.420
 You get off the ride, switch the channel.

57:22.420 --> 57:24.580
 You don't have to go down this path.

57:24.580 --> 57:27.520
 But for me and for many other people,

57:27.520 --> 57:32.140
 it's incredibly freeing to recognize this about the mind

57:32.140 --> 57:37.140
 because one, you realize that you're,

57:38.180 --> 57:39.940
 cutting through the illusion of the self

57:39.940 --> 57:41.820
 is immensely freeing for a lot of reasons

57:41.820 --> 57:44.020
 that we can talk about separately,

57:44.020 --> 57:49.020
 but losing the sense of free will does

57:49.660 --> 57:51.500
 two things very vividly for me.

57:51.500 --> 57:54.780
 One is it totally undercuts the basis for,

57:54.780 --> 57:56.620
 the psychological basis for hatred.

57:56.620 --> 57:59.000
 Because when you think about the experience

57:59.000 --> 58:03.540
 of hating other people, what that is anchored to

58:03.540 --> 58:06.320
 is a feeling that they really are

58:06.320 --> 58:08.640
 the true authors of their actions.

58:08.640 --> 58:10.820
 I mean, if someone is doing something

58:10.820 --> 58:13.220
 that you find so despicable, right?

58:13.220 --> 58:15.940
 Let's say they're targeting you unfairly, right?

58:15.940 --> 58:20.260
 They're maligning you on Twitter or they're suing you

58:20.260 --> 58:22.880
 or they're doing something, they broke your car window,

58:22.880 --> 58:24.700
 they did something awful

58:24.700 --> 58:26.660
 and now you have a grievance against them.

58:26.660 --> 58:30.060
 And you're relating to them very differently emotionally

58:30.060 --> 58:32.400
 in your own mind than you would

58:32.400 --> 58:34.560
 if a force of nature had done this, right?

58:34.560 --> 58:36.740
 Or if it's, if it had just been a virus

58:36.740 --> 58:39.040
 or if it had been a wild animal

58:39.040 --> 58:40.740
 or a malfunctioning machine, right?

58:40.740 --> 58:42.260
 Like to those things you don't attribute

58:42.260 --> 58:44.220
 any kind of freedom of will.

58:44.220 --> 58:47.000
 And while you may suffer the consequences

58:47.000 --> 58:49.980
 of catching a virus or being attacked by a wild animal

58:49.980 --> 58:53.140
 or having your car break down or whatever,

58:53.140 --> 58:54.940
 it may frustrate you.

58:56.060 --> 59:01.060
 You don't slip into this mode of hating the agent

59:01.240 --> 59:06.240
 in a way that completely commandeers your mind

59:06.780 --> 59:07.840
 and deranges your life.

59:07.840 --> 59:09.260
 I mean, you just don't, I mean, there are people

59:09.260 --> 59:14.260
 who spend decades hating other people for what they did

59:15.820 --> 59:18.580
 and it's just pure poison, right?

59:18.580 --> 59:20.900
 So it's a useful shortcut to compassion and empathy.

59:20.900 --> 59:21.740
 Yeah, yeah.

59:21.740 --> 59:24.740
 But the question is, say that this called,

59:24.740 --> 59:26.800
 what was it, the horse of consciousness?

59:26.800 --> 59:30.700
 Let's call it the consciousness generator black box

59:30.700 --> 59:32.560
 that we don't understand.

59:32.560 --> 59:35.980
 And is it possible that the script

59:35.980 --> 59:40.780
 that we're walking along, that we're playing,

59:40.780 --> 59:43.900
 that's already written is actually being written

59:43.900 --> 59:45.220
 in real time.

59:45.220 --> 59:47.680
 It's almost like you're driving down a road

59:47.680 --> 59:50.860
 and in real time, that road is being laid down.

59:50.860 --> 59:53.940
 And this black box of consciousness that we don't understand

59:53.940 --> 59:57.060
 is the place where the script is being generated.

59:57.060 --> 1:00:01.180
 So it's not, it is being generated, it didn't always exist.

1:00:01.180 --> 1:00:02.780
 So there's something we don't understand

1:00:02.780 --> 1:00:05.500
 that's fundamental about the nature of reality

1:00:05.500 --> 1:00:07.520
 that generates both consciousness,

1:00:07.520 --> 1:00:09.860
 let's call it maybe the self.

1:00:09.860 --> 1:00:11.580
 I don't know if you want to distinguish between those.

1:00:11.580 --> 1:00:13.040
 Yeah, I definitely would, yeah.

1:00:13.040 --> 1:00:15.780
 You would, because there's a bunch of illusions

1:00:15.780 --> 1:00:16.620
 we're referring to.

1:00:16.620 --> 1:00:18.220
 There's the illusion of free will,

1:00:18.220 --> 1:00:20.260
 there's the illusion of self,

1:00:20.260 --> 1:00:22.440
 and there's the illusion of consciousness.

1:00:22.440 --> 1:00:25.840
 You're saying, I think you said there's no,

1:00:25.840 --> 1:00:27.020
 you're not as willing to say

1:00:27.020 --> 1:00:28.820
 there's an illusion of consciousness.

1:00:28.820 --> 1:00:29.660
 You're a little bit more.

1:00:29.660 --> 1:00:30.860
 In fact, I would say it's impossible.

1:00:30.860 --> 1:00:31.700
 Impossible.

1:00:31.700 --> 1:00:33.260
 You're a little bit more willing to say

1:00:33.260 --> 1:00:35.540
 that there's an illusion of self,

1:00:35.540 --> 1:00:36.940
 and you're definitely saying

1:00:36.940 --> 1:00:38.580
 there's an illusion of free will.

1:00:38.580 --> 1:00:42.060
 Yes, I'm definitely saying there's an illusion

1:00:42.060 --> 1:00:44.060
 that a certain kind of self is an illusion.

1:00:44.060 --> 1:00:46.340
 Not every, we mean many different things

1:00:46.340 --> 1:00:47.980
 by this notion of self.

1:00:47.980 --> 1:00:50.520
 So maybe I should just differentiate these things.

1:00:50.520 --> 1:00:53.020
 So consciousness can't be an illusion

1:00:53.020 --> 1:00:58.020
 because any illusion proves its reality

1:00:58.080 --> 1:01:00.460
 as much as any other veridical perception.

1:01:00.460 --> 1:01:02.560
 I mean, if you're hallucinating now,

1:01:02.560 --> 1:01:05.660
 that's just as much of a demonstration of consciousness

1:01:05.660 --> 1:01:09.700
 as really seeing what's a quote actually there.

1:01:09.700 --> 1:01:11.940
 If you're dreaming and you don't know it,

1:01:12.940 --> 1:01:15.500
 that is consciousness, right?

1:01:15.500 --> 1:01:17.740
 You can be confused about literally everything.

1:01:17.740 --> 1:01:22.740
 You can't be confused about the underlying claim,

1:01:25.180 --> 1:01:27.580
 whether you make it linguistically or not,

1:01:27.580 --> 1:01:32.580
 but just the cognitive assertion

1:01:34.700 --> 1:01:36.960
 that something seems to be happening.

1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:40.420
 It's the seeming that is the cash value of consciousness.

1:01:40.420 --> 1:01:42.020
 Can I take a tiny tangent?

1:01:42.020 --> 1:01:47.020
 So what if I am creating consciousness in my mind

1:01:47.660 --> 1:01:50.100
 to convince you that I'm human?

1:01:50.100 --> 1:01:52.540
 So it's a useful social tool,

1:01:52.540 --> 1:01:57.540
 not a fundamental property of experience,

1:01:57.940 --> 1:02:00.760
 like of being a living thing.

1:02:00.760 --> 1:02:02.660
 What if it's just like a social tool

1:02:02.660 --> 1:02:07.580
 to almost like a useful computational trick

1:02:07.580 --> 1:02:10.580
 to place myself into reality

1:02:10.580 --> 1:02:13.180
 as we together communicate about this reality?

1:02:14.100 --> 1:02:15.940
 And another way to ask that,

1:02:15.940 --> 1:02:17.540
 because you said it much earlier,

1:02:18.500 --> 1:02:21.340
 you talk negatively about robots as you often do.

1:02:21.340 --> 1:02:24.320
 So let me, because you'll probably die first

1:02:24.320 --> 1:02:25.220
 when they take over.

1:02:26.260 --> 1:02:28.700
 No, I'm looking forward to certain kinds of robots.

1:02:28.700 --> 1:02:31.080
 I mean, I'm not, if we can get this right,

1:02:31.080 --> 1:02:32.060
 this would be amazing.

1:02:32.060 --> 1:02:34.500
 But you don't like the robots that fake consciousness.

1:02:34.500 --> 1:02:35.340
 That's what you,

1:02:35.340 --> 1:02:37.860
 you don't like the idea of fake it till you make it.

1:02:37.860 --> 1:02:40.140
 Well, no, it's not that I don't like it.

1:02:40.140 --> 1:02:43.420
 It's that I'm worried that we will lose sight

1:02:43.420 --> 1:02:44.300
 of the problem.

1:02:44.300 --> 1:02:47.260
 And the problem has massive ethical consequences.

1:02:47.260 --> 1:02:51.940
 I mean, if we create robots that really can suffer,

1:02:51.940 --> 1:02:53.660
 that would be a bad thing, right?

1:02:53.660 --> 1:02:56.460
 And if we really are committing a murder

1:02:56.460 --> 1:02:59.220
 when we recycle them, that would be a bad thing.

1:02:59.220 --> 1:03:00.300
 This is how I know you're not Russian.

1:03:00.300 --> 1:03:03.260
 Why is it a bad thing that we create robots that can suffer?

1:03:03.260 --> 1:03:05.280
 Isn't suffering a fundamental thing

1:03:05.280 --> 1:03:07.240
 from which like beauty springs?

1:03:07.240 --> 1:03:08.580
 Like without suffering,

1:03:08.580 --> 1:03:10.300
 do you really think we would have beautiful things

1:03:10.300 --> 1:03:11.700
 in this world?

1:03:11.700 --> 1:03:14.700
 Okay, that's a tangent on a tangent.

1:03:14.700 --> 1:03:15.540
 We'll go there.

1:03:15.540 --> 1:03:17.100
 I would love to go there, but let's not go there just yet.

1:03:17.100 --> 1:03:17.940
 All right.

1:03:17.940 --> 1:03:20.340
 But I do think it would be, if anything is bad,

1:03:20.340 --> 1:03:22.780
 creating hell and populating it

1:03:22.780 --> 1:03:27.020
 with real minds that really can suffer in that hell,

1:03:27.020 --> 1:03:28.940
 that's bad.

1:03:28.940 --> 1:03:33.940
 You are worse than any mass murderer we can name

1:03:34.660 --> 1:03:35.540
 if you create it.

1:03:35.540 --> 1:03:37.300
 I mean, this could be in robot form,

1:03:37.300 --> 1:03:41.440
 or more likely it would be in some simulation of a world

1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:43.740
 where we managed to populate it with conscious minds

1:03:43.740 --> 1:03:46.280
 whether we knew they were conscious or not.

1:03:46.280 --> 1:03:49.780
 And that world is a state of, it's unendurable.

1:03:50.600 --> 1:03:53.200
 That would just, it just taking the thesis seriously

1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:58.140
 that there's nothing that mind intelligence

1:03:58.140 --> 1:04:00.780
 and consciousness ultimately are substrate independent.

1:04:00.780 --> 1:04:01.620
 Right?

1:04:01.620 --> 1:04:02.760
 It doesn't, you don't need a biological brain

1:04:02.760 --> 1:04:03.600
 to be conscious.

1:04:03.600 --> 1:04:04.780
 You certainly don't need a biological brain

1:04:04.780 --> 1:04:05.660
 to be intelligent.

1:04:05.660 --> 1:04:06.500
 Right?

1:04:06.500 --> 1:04:09.040
 So if we just imagine the consciousness at some point

1:04:09.040 --> 1:04:12.560
 comes along for the ride as you scale up in intelligence,

1:04:12.560 --> 1:04:16.020
 well then we could find ourselves creating conscious minds

1:04:16.020 --> 1:04:17.180
 that are miserable, right?

1:04:17.180 --> 1:04:19.740
 And that's just like creating a person who's miserable.

1:04:19.740 --> 1:04:20.580
 Right?

1:04:20.580 --> 1:04:21.900
 It could be worse than creating a person who's miserable.

1:04:21.900 --> 1:04:23.780
 It could be even more sensitive to suffering.

1:04:23.780 --> 1:04:26.300
 Cloning them and maybe for entertainment

1:04:26.300 --> 1:04:27.980
 and watching them suffer.

1:04:27.980 --> 1:04:31.700
 Just like watching a person suffer for entertainment.

1:04:31.700 --> 1:04:32.700
 You know?

1:04:32.700 --> 1:04:36.060
 So, but back to your primary question here,

1:04:36.060 --> 1:04:40.580
 which is differentiating consciousness and self

1:04:40.580 --> 1:04:42.060
 and free will as concepts

1:04:42.060 --> 1:04:46.820
 and kind of degrees of illusoriness.

1:04:46.820 --> 1:04:48.740
 The problem with free will is that

1:04:50.460 --> 1:04:53.040
 what most people mean by it,

1:04:53.040 --> 1:04:56.140
 and this is where Dan Dennett

1:04:56.140 --> 1:04:57.580
 is gonna get off the ride here, right?

1:04:57.580 --> 1:04:59.980
 So like he doesn't, he's gonna disagree with me

1:04:59.980 --> 1:05:02.260
 that I know what most people mean by it.

1:05:02.260 --> 1:05:07.260
 But I have a very keen sense having talked about this topic

1:05:07.700 --> 1:05:09.340
 for many, many years

1:05:09.340 --> 1:05:13.300
 and seeing people get wrapped around the axle of it

1:05:13.300 --> 1:05:17.980
 and seeing in myself what it's like to have felt

1:05:17.980 --> 1:05:20.020
 that I was a self that had free will

1:05:20.020 --> 1:05:22.220
 and then to no longer feel that way, right?

1:05:22.220 --> 1:05:24.600
 To know what it's like to actually disabuse myself

1:05:24.600 --> 1:05:29.600
 of that sense cognitively and emotionally

1:05:30.040 --> 1:05:32.700
 and to recognize what's left, what goes away

1:05:32.700 --> 1:05:35.980
 and what doesn't go away on the basis of that epiphany.

1:05:35.980 --> 1:05:40.620
 I have a sense that I know what people think they have

1:05:40.620 --> 1:05:44.460
 in hand when they worry about whether free will exists.

1:05:44.460 --> 1:05:49.460
 And it is the flip side of this feeling of self.

1:05:50.220 --> 1:05:51.500
 It's the flip side of feeling

1:05:51.500 --> 1:05:56.500
 like you are not merely identical to experience.

1:05:57.020 --> 1:05:59.020
 You feel like you're having an experience.

1:05:59.020 --> 1:06:00.380
 You feel like you're an agent

1:06:00.380 --> 1:06:02.220
 that is appropriating an experience.

1:06:02.220 --> 1:06:05.100
 There's a protagonist in the movie of your life

1:06:05.100 --> 1:06:06.220
 and it is you.

1:06:07.260 --> 1:06:09.420
 It's not just the movie, right?

1:06:09.420 --> 1:06:13.420
 It's like there's sights and sounds and sensations

1:06:13.420 --> 1:06:14.660
 and thoughts and emotions

1:06:14.660 --> 1:06:17.840
 and this whole cacophony of experience,

1:06:17.840 --> 1:06:21.320
 of felt experience, of felt experience of embodiment.

1:06:21.320 --> 1:06:26.060
 But there seems to be a rider on the horse

1:06:26.060 --> 1:06:28.380
 or a passenger in the body, right?

1:06:28.380 --> 1:06:30.820
 People don't feel truly identical to their bodies

1:06:30.820 --> 1:06:32.780
 down to their toes.

1:06:32.780 --> 1:06:34.760
 They sort of feel like they have bodies.

1:06:34.760 --> 1:06:37.100
 They feel like their minds in bodies

1:06:37.100 --> 1:06:42.100
 and that feels like a self, that feels like me.

1:06:42.220 --> 1:06:45.080
 And again, this gets very paradoxical

1:06:45.080 --> 1:06:47.420
 when you talk about the experience

1:06:47.420 --> 1:06:50.100
 of being in relationship to yourself

1:06:50.100 --> 1:06:52.400
 or talking to yourself, giving yourself a pep talk.

1:06:52.400 --> 1:06:54.220
 I mean, if you're the one talking,

1:06:54.220 --> 1:06:55.800
 why are you also the one listening?

1:06:55.800 --> 1:06:57.900
 Like, why do you need the pep talk and why does it work

1:06:57.900 --> 1:07:00.020
 if you're the one giving the pep talk, right?

1:07:00.020 --> 1:07:02.120
 Or if I say like, where are my keys?

1:07:02.120 --> 1:07:03.780
 Or if I'm looking for my keys,

1:07:03.780 --> 1:07:06.740
 why do I think the superfluous thought, where are my keys?

1:07:06.740 --> 1:07:08.420
 I know I'm looking for the fucking keys.

1:07:08.420 --> 1:07:11.400
 I'm the one looking, who am I telling

1:07:11.400 --> 1:07:13.840
 that we now need to look for the keys, right?

1:07:13.840 --> 1:07:16.320
 So that duality is weird, but leave that aside.

1:07:17.420 --> 1:07:22.260
 There's the sense, and this becomes very vivid

1:07:22.260 --> 1:07:25.420
 when people try to learn to meditate.

1:07:25.420 --> 1:07:28.720
 Most people, they close their eyes

1:07:28.720 --> 1:07:30.600
 and they're told to pay attention to an object

1:07:30.600 --> 1:07:31.980
 like the breath, say.

1:07:31.980 --> 1:07:35.280
 So you close your eyes and you pay attention to the breath

1:07:35.280 --> 1:07:37.240
 and you can feel it at the tip of your nose

1:07:37.240 --> 1:07:39.480
 or the rising and falling of your abdomen

1:07:40.480 --> 1:07:42.220
 and you're paying attention

1:07:42.220 --> 1:07:44.920
 and you feel something vague there.

1:07:44.920 --> 1:07:46.880
 And then you think, I thought, well, why the breath?

1:07:46.880 --> 1:07:49.680
 Why am I paying attention to the breath?

1:07:49.680 --> 1:07:51.780
 What's so special about the breath?

1:07:51.780 --> 1:07:54.160
 And then you notice you're thinking

1:07:54.160 --> 1:07:55.720
 and you're not paying attention to the breath anymore.

1:07:55.720 --> 1:07:58.000
 And then you realize, okay, the practice is,

1:07:58.000 --> 1:07:59.840
 okay, I should notice thoughts

1:07:59.840 --> 1:08:01.960
 and then I should come back to the breath.

1:08:01.960 --> 1:08:06.800
 But this starting point of the conventional starting point

1:08:06.800 --> 1:08:10.200
 of feeling like you are an agent, very likely in your head,

1:08:10.200 --> 1:08:12.960
 a locus of consciousness, a locus of attention

1:08:12.960 --> 1:08:15.840
 that can strategically pay attention

1:08:15.840 --> 1:08:17.220
 to certain parts of experience.

1:08:17.220 --> 1:08:18.760
 Like I can focus on the breath

1:08:18.760 --> 1:08:20.600
 and then I get lost in thought

1:08:20.600 --> 1:08:22.440
 and now I can come back to the breath

1:08:22.440 --> 1:08:26.120
 and I can open my eyes and I'm over here behind my face

1:08:26.120 --> 1:08:28.680
 looking out at a world that's other than me

1:08:28.680 --> 1:08:31.920
 and there's this kind of subject object perception.

1:08:31.920 --> 1:08:35.200
 And that is the default starting point of selfhood,

1:08:35.200 --> 1:08:36.920
 of subjectivity.

1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:41.480
 And married to that is the sense that

1:08:42.680 --> 1:08:46.280
 I can decide what to do next, right?

1:08:46.280 --> 1:08:50.340
 I am an agent who can pay attention to the cup.

1:08:50.340 --> 1:08:52.020
 I can listen to sounds.

1:08:52.020 --> 1:08:53.580
 There's certain things that I can't control.

1:08:53.580 --> 1:08:54.640
 Certain things are happening to me

1:08:54.640 --> 1:08:55.880
 and I just can't control them.

1:08:55.880 --> 1:08:59.000
 So for instance, if someone asks,

1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:02.400
 well, can you not hear a sound, right?

1:09:02.400 --> 1:09:03.840
 Like don't hear the next sound,

1:09:03.840 --> 1:09:05.280
 don't hear anything for a second,

1:09:05.280 --> 1:09:09.200
 or don't hear, I'm snapping my fingers, don't hear this.

1:09:09.200 --> 1:09:10.120
 Where's your free will?

1:09:10.120 --> 1:09:12.560
 You know, well, like just stop this from coming in.

1:09:12.560 --> 1:09:14.640
 You realize, okay, wait a minute.

1:09:14.640 --> 1:09:18.320
 My abundant freedom does not extend

1:09:18.320 --> 1:09:20.840
 to something as simple as just being able to pay attention

1:09:20.840 --> 1:09:22.560
 to something else than this.

1:09:23.640 --> 1:09:25.860
 Okay, well, so I'm not that kind of free agent,

1:09:25.860 --> 1:09:28.880
 but at least I can decide what I'm gonna do next

1:09:28.880 --> 1:09:32.080
 and I'm gonna pick up this water, right?

1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:36.760
 And there's a feeling of identification

1:09:36.760 --> 1:09:39.720
 with the impulse, with the intention,

1:09:39.720 --> 1:09:41.240
 with the thought that occurs to you,

1:09:41.240 --> 1:09:43.480
 with the feeling of speaking.

1:09:43.480 --> 1:09:45.540
 Like what am I gonna say next?

1:09:45.540 --> 1:09:46.380
 Well, I'm saying it.

1:09:46.380 --> 1:09:48.960
 So here goes, this is me.

1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:50.560
 It feels like I'm the thinker.

1:09:50.560 --> 1:09:53.780
 I'm the one who's in control.

1:09:53.780 --> 1:09:58.780
 But all of that is born of not really paying close attention

1:10:00.020 --> 1:10:01.980
 to what it's like to be you.

1:10:01.980 --> 1:10:05.260
 And so this is where meditation comes in,

1:10:05.260 --> 1:10:09.980
 or this is where, again, you can get at this conceptually.

1:10:09.980 --> 1:10:11.740
 You can unravel the notion of free will

1:10:11.740 --> 1:10:15.760
 just by thinking certain thoughts,

1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:18.900
 but you can't feel that it doesn't exist

1:10:18.900 --> 1:10:20.740
 unless you can pay close attention

1:10:20.740 --> 1:10:22.980
 to how thoughts and intentions arise.

1:10:22.980 --> 1:10:24.620
 So the way to unravel it conceptually

1:10:24.620 --> 1:10:27.340
 is just to realize, okay, I didn't make myself.

1:10:27.340 --> 1:10:28.420
 I didn't make my genes.

1:10:28.420 --> 1:10:29.340
 I didn't make my brain.

1:10:29.340 --> 1:10:31.780
 I didn't make the environmental influences

1:10:31.780 --> 1:10:35.220
 that impinged upon this system for the last 54 years

1:10:35.220 --> 1:10:38.860
 that have produced my brain in precisely the state

1:10:38.860 --> 1:10:42.860
 it's in right now, such and with all of the receptor weightings

1:10:42.860 --> 1:10:45.700
 and densities, and it's just,

1:10:45.700 --> 1:10:48.560
 I'm exactly the machine I am right now

1:10:48.560 --> 1:10:53.560
 through no fault of my own as the experiencing self.

1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:56.900
 I get no credit and I get no blame

1:10:56.900 --> 1:11:00.620
 for the genetics and the environmental influences here.

1:11:00.620 --> 1:11:03.300
 And yet those are the only things

1:11:03.300 --> 1:11:08.300
 that contrive to produce my next thought

1:11:09.380 --> 1:11:12.900
 or impulse or moment of behavior.

1:11:12.900 --> 1:11:14.920
 And if you were going to add something magical

1:11:14.920 --> 1:11:18.620
 to that clockwork, like an immortal soul,

1:11:18.620 --> 1:11:21.620
 you can also notice that you didn't produce your soul.

1:11:21.620 --> 1:11:22.780
 You can't account for the fact

1:11:22.780 --> 1:11:25.980
 that you don't have the soul of someone

1:11:25.980 --> 1:11:28.340
 who doesn't like any of the things you like

1:11:28.340 --> 1:11:29.920
 or wasn't interested in any of the things

1:11:29.920 --> 1:11:33.080
 you were interested in or was a psychopath

1:11:33.080 --> 1:11:35.180
 or had an IQ of 40.

1:11:35.180 --> 1:11:38.700
 I mean, there's nothing about that

1:11:38.700 --> 1:11:41.620
 that the person who believes in a soul

1:11:41.620 --> 1:11:43.100
 can claim to have controlled.

1:11:43.100 --> 1:11:45.860
 And yet that is also totally dispositive

1:11:45.860 --> 1:11:48.400
 of whatever happens next.

1:11:48.400 --> 1:11:51.160
 But everything you've described now,

1:11:51.160 --> 1:11:52.100
 maybe you can correct me,

1:11:52.100 --> 1:11:54.580
 but it kind of speaks to the materialistic nature

1:11:54.580 --> 1:11:55.760
 of the hardware.

1:11:57.340 --> 1:12:01.180
 But even if you add magical ectoplasm software,

1:12:01.180 --> 1:12:03.060
 you didn't produce that either.

1:12:03.060 --> 1:12:08.060
 I know, but if we can think about the actual computation

1:12:08.060 --> 1:12:11.060
 running on the hardware and running on the software,

1:12:11.060 --> 1:12:12.700
 there's something you said recently

1:12:12.700 --> 1:12:17.260
 which you think of culture as an operating system.

1:12:17.260 --> 1:12:21.140
 So if we just remove ourselves a little bit

1:12:21.140 --> 1:12:24.140
 from the conception of human civilization

1:12:24.140 --> 1:12:26.100
 being a collection of humans

1:12:26.100 --> 1:12:28.380
 and rather us just being a distributed

1:12:30.140 --> 1:12:32.180
 computation system on which there's

1:12:32.180 --> 1:12:34.100
 some kind of operating system running,

1:12:34.100 --> 1:12:36.500
 and then the computation that's running

1:12:36.500 --> 1:12:38.940
 is the actual thing that generates

1:12:38.940 --> 1:12:40.520
 the interactions, the communications,

1:12:40.520 --> 1:12:42.820
 and maybe even free will, the experiences

1:12:42.820 --> 1:12:44.260
 of all those free will.

1:12:44.260 --> 1:12:46.140
 Do you ever think of, do you ever try

1:12:46.140 --> 1:12:47.720
 to reframe the world in that way

1:12:47.720 --> 1:12:51.740
 where it's like ideas are just using us,

1:12:51.740 --> 1:12:56.520
 thoughts are using individual nodes in the system,

1:12:56.520 --> 1:12:58.040
 and they're just jumping around,

1:12:58.040 --> 1:13:01.460
 and they also have ability to generate experiences

1:13:01.460 --> 1:13:03.620
 so that we can push those ideas along.

1:13:03.620 --> 1:13:05.820
 And basically the main organisms here

1:13:05.820 --> 1:13:07.980
 are the thoughts, not the humans.

1:13:07.980 --> 1:13:11.860
 Yeah, but then that erodes the boundary

1:13:11.860 --> 1:13:15.220
 between self and world.

1:13:15.220 --> 1:13:16.060
 Right.

1:13:16.060 --> 1:13:19.660
 So then there's no self, really integrated self

1:13:19.660 --> 1:13:22.420
 to have any kind of will at all.

1:13:22.420 --> 1:13:24.500
 Like if you're just a meme plex,

1:13:24.500 --> 1:13:28.680
 I mean, if you're just a collection of memes,

1:13:28.680 --> 1:13:32.020
 and I mean, we're all kind of like currents,

1:13:32.020 --> 1:13:35.960
 like eddies in this river of ideas, right?

1:13:35.960 --> 1:13:40.740
 So it's like, and it seems to have structure,

1:13:40.740 --> 1:13:43.340
 but there's no real boundary between that part

1:13:43.340 --> 1:13:44.960
 of the flow of water and the rest.

1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:47.300
 I mean, if our, and I would say that much

1:13:47.300 --> 1:13:49.660
 of our mind answers to this kind of description.

1:13:49.660 --> 1:13:52.660
 I mean, so much of our mind has been,

1:13:53.500 --> 1:13:55.460
 it's obviously not self generated,

1:13:55.460 --> 1:13:56.940
 and it's not, you're not gonna find it

1:13:56.940 --> 1:13:58.060
 by looking in the brain.

1:13:58.060 --> 1:14:03.060
 It is the result of culture largely,

1:14:03.060 --> 1:14:08.060
 but also, you know, the genes on one side

1:14:10.740 --> 1:14:13.700
 and culture on the other meeting

1:14:13.700 --> 1:14:18.700
 to allow for manifestations of mind

1:14:20.500 --> 1:14:22.500
 that don't, that aren't actually bounded

1:14:22.500 --> 1:14:26.660
 by the person in any clear sense.

1:14:26.660 --> 1:14:31.060
 It was just, I mean, the example I often use here,

1:14:31.060 --> 1:14:33.620
 but there's so many others is just the fact

1:14:33.620 --> 1:14:36.240
 that we're following the rules of English grammar

1:14:36.240 --> 1:14:37.820
 to whatever degree we are.

1:14:37.820 --> 1:14:40.540
 It's not that we certainly haven't consciously represented

1:14:40.540 --> 1:14:42.340
 these rules for ourself.

1:14:42.340 --> 1:14:44.060
 We haven't invented these rules.

1:14:44.060 --> 1:14:48.500
 We haven't, I mean, there are norms of language use

1:14:48.500 --> 1:14:53.060
 that we couldn't even specify because we haven't,

1:14:53.060 --> 1:14:54.300
 you know, we're not grammarians.

1:14:54.300 --> 1:14:56.340
 We're not, we haven't studied this.

1:14:56.340 --> 1:14:58.100
 We don't even have the right concepts,

1:14:58.100 --> 1:14:59.840
 and yet we're following these rules,

1:14:59.840 --> 1:15:03.220
 and we're noticing, you know, we're noticing as, you know,

1:15:03.220 --> 1:15:06.160
 an error when we fail to follow these rules,

1:15:08.060 --> 1:15:11.060
 and virtually every other cultural norm is like that.

1:15:11.060 --> 1:15:13.020
 I mean, these are not things we've invented.

1:15:13.020 --> 1:15:17.060
 You can consciously decide to scrutinize them

1:15:17.060 --> 1:15:21.220
 and override them, but, I mean, just think of,

1:15:21.220 --> 1:15:23.560
 just think of any social situation

1:15:23.560 --> 1:15:27.500
 where you're with other people and you're behaving

1:15:27.500 --> 1:15:31.540
 in ways that are culturally appropriate, right?

1:15:31.540 --> 1:15:32.620
 You're not being, you know,

1:15:32.620 --> 1:15:34.540
 you're not being wild animals together.

1:15:34.540 --> 1:15:36.500
 You're following, you have some expectation

1:15:36.500 --> 1:15:38.940
 of how you shake a person's hand

1:15:38.940 --> 1:15:43.380
 and how you deal with implements on a table,

1:15:43.380 --> 1:15:44.940
 how you have a meal together.

1:15:44.940 --> 1:15:47.500
 Obviously, this can change from culture to culture,

1:15:47.500 --> 1:15:49.300
 and people can be shocked

1:15:49.300 --> 1:15:51.200
 by how different those things are, right?

1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:53.920
 We, you know, we all have foods we find disgusting,

1:15:53.920 --> 1:15:57.100
 but in some countries, dog is not one of those foods, right?

1:15:57.100 --> 1:15:59.140
 And yet, you know, you and I presumably

1:15:59.140 --> 1:16:01.300
 would be horrified to be served dog.

1:16:03.600 --> 1:16:06.980
 Those are not norms that we're,

1:16:06.980 --> 1:16:09.100
 they are outside of us in some way,

1:16:09.100 --> 1:16:13.340
 and yet they're felt very viscerally.

1:16:13.340 --> 1:16:15.940
 I mean, they're certainly felt in their violation.

1:16:15.940 --> 1:16:18.140
 You know, if you are, just imagine,

1:16:18.140 --> 1:16:21.200
 you're in somebody's home,

1:16:21.200 --> 1:16:23.660
 you're eating something that tastes great to you,

1:16:23.660 --> 1:16:25.700
 and you happen to be in Vietnam or wherever,

1:16:25.700 --> 1:16:28.660
 you know, you didn't realize dog was potentially

1:16:28.660 --> 1:16:32.780
 on the menu, and you find out that you've just eaten

1:16:32.780 --> 1:16:37.300
 10 bites of what is, you know, really a cocker spaniel,

1:16:37.300 --> 1:16:42.300
 and you feel this instantaneous urge to vomit, right,

1:16:42.980 --> 1:16:44.880
 based on an idea, right?

1:16:44.880 --> 1:16:47.040
 Like, so, like, you did not,

1:16:47.040 --> 1:16:49.860
 you're not the author of that norm

1:16:51.020 --> 1:16:55.620
 that gave you such a powerful experience of its violation,

1:16:55.620 --> 1:16:59.620
 and I'm sure we can trace the moment in your history,

1:16:59.620 --> 1:17:01.340
 you know, vaguely, where it sort of got in.

1:17:01.340 --> 1:17:02.940
 I mean, very early on as kids,

1:17:02.940 --> 1:17:05.940
 you realize you're treating dogs as pets

1:17:05.940 --> 1:17:08.400
 and not as food, or as potential food.

1:17:10.460 --> 1:17:15.460
 But yeah, no, it's, but the point you just made

1:17:15.700 --> 1:17:18.980
 opens us to, like, we are totally permeable

1:17:18.980 --> 1:17:22.020
 to a sea of mind.

1:17:22.020 --> 1:17:24.380
 Yeah, but if we take the metaphor

1:17:24.380 --> 1:17:26.220
 of the distributed computing systems,

1:17:26.220 --> 1:17:29.860
 each individual node is,

1:17:29.860 --> 1:17:32.700
 is part of performing a much larger computation,

1:17:32.700 --> 1:17:36.460
 but it nevertheless is in charge of doing the scheduling

1:17:36.460 --> 1:17:39.260
 of, so, assuming it's Linux,

1:17:39.260 --> 1:17:41.060
 is doing the scheduling of processes

1:17:41.060 --> 1:17:42.700
 and is constantly alternating them.

1:17:42.700 --> 1:17:46.200
 That node is making those choices.

1:17:46.200 --> 1:17:49.220
 That node sure as hell believes it has free will,

1:17:49.220 --> 1:17:51.100
 and it actually has free will

1:17:51.100 --> 1:17:53.140
 because it's making those hard choices,

1:17:53.140 --> 1:17:54.860
 but the choices ultimately are part

1:17:54.860 --> 1:17:57.340
 of a much larger computation that it can't control.

1:17:57.340 --> 1:17:59.900
 Isn't it possible for that node to still be,

1:17:59.900 --> 1:18:04.060
 that human node is still making the choice?

1:18:04.060 --> 1:18:05.140
 Well, yeah, it is.

1:18:05.140 --> 1:18:08.820
 So I'm not saying that your body

1:18:08.820 --> 1:18:11.660
 isn't doing, really doing things, right?

1:18:11.660 --> 1:18:14.060
 And some of those things can be

1:18:14.060 --> 1:18:16.420
 conventionally thought of as choices, right?

1:18:16.420 --> 1:18:19.100
 So it's like, I can choose to reach,

1:18:19.100 --> 1:18:21.620
 and it's like, it's not being imposed on me.

1:18:21.620 --> 1:18:22.780
 That would be a different experience.

1:18:22.780 --> 1:18:26.740
 Like, so there's an experience of all,

1:18:26.740 --> 1:18:27.980
 you know, there's definitely a difference

1:18:27.980 --> 1:18:30.740
 between voluntary and involuntary action.

1:18:30.740 --> 1:18:34.060
 There's, so that has to get conserved.

1:18:34.060 --> 1:18:36.580
 By any account of the mind that jettisons free will,

1:18:36.580 --> 1:18:39.260
 you still have to admit that there's a difference

1:18:39.260 --> 1:18:42.920
 between a tremor that I can't control

1:18:42.920 --> 1:18:47.620
 and a purposeful motor action that I can control

1:18:47.620 --> 1:18:49.140
 and I can initiate on demand,

1:18:49.140 --> 1:18:50.940
 and it's associated with intentions.

1:18:50.940 --> 1:18:55.780
 And it's got efferent, you know, motor copy,

1:18:55.780 --> 1:18:59.660
 which is being predictive so that I can notice errors.

1:18:59.660 --> 1:19:00.940
 You know, I have expectations.

1:19:00.940 --> 1:19:02.060
 When I reach for this,

1:19:02.060 --> 1:19:04.440
 if my hand were actually to pass through the bottle,

1:19:04.440 --> 1:19:07.180
 because it's a hologram, I would be surprised, right?

1:19:07.180 --> 1:19:09.180
 And so that shows that I have a expectation

1:19:09.180 --> 1:19:12.140
 of just what my grasping behavior is gonna be like

1:19:12.140 --> 1:19:13.740
 even before it happens.

1:19:13.740 --> 1:19:14.620
 Whereas with a tremor,

1:19:14.620 --> 1:19:17.120
 you don't have the same kind of thing going on.

1:19:17.120 --> 1:19:19.960
 That's a distinction we have to make.

1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:24.960
 So I am, yes, I'm really, my intention to move,

1:19:26.980 --> 1:19:28.980
 which is in fact can be subjectively felt,

1:19:28.980 --> 1:19:31.020
 really is the proximate cause of my moving.

1:19:31.020 --> 1:19:33.300
 It's not coming from elsewhere in the universe.

1:19:33.300 --> 1:19:35.060
 I'm not saying that.

1:19:35.060 --> 1:19:37.580
 So in that sense, the node is really deciding

1:19:37.580 --> 1:19:42.260
 to execute, you know, the subroutine now.

1:19:42.260 --> 1:19:47.260
 But that's not the feeling

1:19:47.260 --> 1:19:52.260
 that has given rise to this conundrum of free will, right?

1:19:54.820 --> 1:19:57.060
 So the people feel like,

1:19:58.680 --> 1:20:01.580
 people feel like the crucial thing is that people feel

1:20:01.580 --> 1:20:04.300
 like they could have done otherwise, right?

1:20:04.300 --> 1:20:05.880
 That's the thing that,

1:20:05.880 --> 1:20:09.500
 so when you run back the clock of your life, right?

1:20:09.500 --> 1:20:11.260
 You run back the movie of your life,

1:20:11.260 --> 1:20:14.640
 you flip back the few pages in the novel of your life,

1:20:14.640 --> 1:20:18.020
 they feel that at this point,

1:20:18.020 --> 1:20:20.820
 they could behave differently than they did, right?

1:20:20.820 --> 1:20:23.260
 So like, but given, you know,

1:20:23.260 --> 1:20:25.880
 even given your distributed computing example,

1:20:27.780 --> 1:20:30.500
 it's either a fully deterministic system

1:20:30.500 --> 1:20:32.140
 or it's a deterministic system

1:20:32.140 --> 1:20:36.220
 that admits of some random, you know, influence.

1:20:36.220 --> 1:20:37.780
 In either case,

1:20:39.540 --> 1:20:41.580
 that's not the free will people think they have.

1:20:41.580 --> 1:20:45.540
 The free will people think they have is, damn,

1:20:45.540 --> 1:20:46.540
 I shouldn't have done that.

1:20:46.540 --> 1:20:49.440
 I just like, I shouldn't have done that.

1:20:49.440 --> 1:20:51.420
 I could have done otherwise, right?

1:20:51.420 --> 1:20:52.740
 I should have done otherwise, right?

1:20:52.740 --> 1:20:55.420
 Like if you think about something

1:20:55.420 --> 1:20:57.660
 that you deeply regret doing, right?

1:20:57.660 --> 1:21:00.860
 Or that you hold someone else responsible for

1:21:00.860 --> 1:21:03.300
 because they really are the upstream agent

1:21:03.300 --> 1:21:05.640
 in your mind of what they did.

1:21:05.640 --> 1:21:08.140
 You know, that's an awful thing that that person did

1:21:08.140 --> 1:21:09.700
 and they shouldn't have done it.

1:21:09.700 --> 1:21:12.940
 So there is this illusion and it has to be an illusion

1:21:12.940 --> 1:21:17.100
 because there's no picture of causation

1:21:17.100 --> 1:21:18.940
 that would make sense of it.

1:21:18.940 --> 1:21:21.900
 There's this illusion that if you arrange the universe

1:21:21.900 --> 1:21:24.440
 exactly the way it was a moment ago,

1:21:24.440 --> 1:21:27.020
 it could have played out differently.

1:21:27.020 --> 1:21:31.580
 And the only way it could have played out differently

1:21:31.580 --> 1:21:34.820
 is if there's randomness added to that,

1:21:34.820 --> 1:21:37.840
 but randomness isn't what people feel

1:21:37.840 --> 1:21:39.380
 would give them free will, right?

1:21:39.380 --> 1:21:41.140
 If you tell me that, you know,

1:21:41.140 --> 1:21:43.980
 I only reached for the water bottle this time

1:21:43.980 --> 1:21:47.060
 because there's a random number generator in there

1:21:47.060 --> 1:21:51.220
 kicking off values and it finally moved my hand,

1:21:51.220 --> 1:21:54.060
 that's not the feeling of authorship.

1:21:54.060 --> 1:21:55.680
 That's still not control.

1:21:55.680 --> 1:21:58.140
 You're still not making that decision.

1:21:58.140 --> 1:22:00.560
 There's actually, I don't know if you're familiar

1:22:00.560 --> 1:22:01.780
 with cellular automata.

1:22:01.780 --> 1:22:03.580
 It's a really nice visualization

1:22:03.580 --> 1:22:07.780
 of how simple rules can create incredible complexity

1:22:07.780 --> 1:22:11.020
 that it's like really dumb initial conditions to set,

1:22:11.020 --> 1:22:14.980
 simple rules applied, and eventually you watch this thing

1:22:14.980 --> 1:22:18.660
 and if the initial conditions are correct,

1:22:18.660 --> 1:22:21.380
 then you're going to have emerged something

1:22:21.380 --> 1:22:23.200
 that to our perception system

1:22:23.200 --> 1:22:25.460
 looks like organisms interacting.

1:22:25.460 --> 1:22:27.120
 You can construct any kinds of worlds

1:22:27.120 --> 1:22:29.780
 and they're not actually interacting.

1:22:29.780 --> 1:22:31.980
 They're not actually even organisms.

1:22:31.980 --> 1:22:34.940
 And they certainly aren't making decisions.

1:22:34.940 --> 1:22:37.120
 So there's like systems you can create

1:22:37.120 --> 1:22:38.580
 that illustrate this point.

1:22:38.580 --> 1:22:42.840
 The question is whether there could be some room

1:22:42.840 --> 1:22:47.440
 for let's use in the 21st century the term magic,

1:22:47.440 --> 1:22:50.220
 back to the black box of consciousness.

1:22:50.220 --> 1:22:51.860
 Let me ask it this way.

1:22:51.860 --> 1:22:56.360
 If you're wrong about your intuition about free will,

1:22:56.360 --> 1:22:58.420
 what, and somebody comes along to you

1:22:58.420 --> 1:23:03.300
 and proves to you that you didn't have the full picture,

1:23:03.300 --> 1:23:04.900
 what would that proof look like?

1:23:04.900 --> 1:23:05.740
 What would?

1:23:05.740 --> 1:23:08.660
 So that's the problem, that's why it's not even an illusion

1:23:08.660 --> 1:23:13.660
 in my world because for me, it's impossible to say

1:23:14.500 --> 1:23:16.860
 what the universe would have to be like

1:23:16.860 --> 1:23:19.220
 for free will to be a thing, right?

1:23:19.220 --> 1:23:22.500
 It doesn't conceptually map onto any notion

1:23:22.500 --> 1:23:24.740
 of causation we have.

1:23:24.740 --> 1:23:29.440
 And that's unlike any other spurious claim you might make.

1:23:29.440 --> 1:23:33.760
 So like if you're gonna believe in ghosts, right?

1:23:33.760 --> 1:23:37.900
 I understand what that claim could be,

1:23:37.900 --> 1:23:40.180
 where like I don't happen to believe in ghosts,

1:23:40.180 --> 1:23:44.300
 but it's not hard for me to specify

1:23:44.300 --> 1:23:47.340
 what would have to be true for ghosts to be real.

1:23:47.340 --> 1:23:50.060
 And so it is with a thousand other things like ghosts,

1:23:50.060 --> 1:23:52.020
 right, so like, okay, so you're telling me

1:23:52.020 --> 1:23:54.820
 that when people die, there's some part of them

1:23:54.820 --> 1:23:57.460
 that is not reducible at all to their biology

1:23:57.460 --> 1:24:00.620
 that lifts off them and goes elsewhere

1:24:00.620 --> 1:24:02.180
 and is actually the kind of thing

1:24:02.180 --> 1:24:04.660
 that they can linger in closets and in cupboards

1:24:04.660 --> 1:24:07.620
 and actually it's immaterial,

1:24:07.620 --> 1:24:09.200
 but by some principle of physics,

1:24:09.200 --> 1:24:11.600
 we don't totally understand it can make sounds

1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:15.820
 and knock objects and even occasionally show up

1:24:15.820 --> 1:24:17.480
 so they can be visually beheld.

1:24:18.900 --> 1:24:21.700
 And it's just, it seems like a miracle,

1:24:21.700 --> 1:24:25.580
 but it's just some spooky noun in the universe

1:24:25.580 --> 1:24:28.200
 that we don't understand, let's call it a ghost.

1:24:29.460 --> 1:24:31.940
 That's fine, I can talk about that all day.

1:24:31.940 --> 1:24:32.980
 The reasons to believe in it,

1:24:32.980 --> 1:24:34.160
 the reasons not to believe in it,

1:24:34.160 --> 1:24:36.340
 the way we would scientifically test for it,

1:24:36.340 --> 1:24:38.180
 what would have to be provable

1:24:38.180 --> 1:24:40.920
 so as to convince me that ghosts are real.

1:24:42.580 --> 1:24:44.260
 Free will isn't like that at all.

1:24:44.260 --> 1:24:49.260
 There's no description of any concatenation of causes

1:24:49.320 --> 1:24:52.140
 that precedes my conscious experience

1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:55.340
 that sounds like what people think they have

1:24:55.340 --> 1:24:56.980
 when they think they could have done otherwise

1:24:56.980 --> 1:25:00.180
 and that they really, that they, the conscious agent,

1:25:00.180 --> 1:25:01.900
 is really in charge, right?

1:25:01.900 --> 1:25:05.040
 Like if you don't know what you're going to think next,

1:25:05.040 --> 1:25:07.460
 right, and you can't help but think it,

1:25:09.700 --> 1:25:12.860
 take those two premises on board.

1:25:12.860 --> 1:25:14.780
 You don't know what it's gonna be,

1:25:14.780 --> 1:25:18.240
 you can't stop it from coming,

1:25:18.240 --> 1:25:21.820
 and until you actually know how to meditate,

1:25:21.820 --> 1:25:24.680
 you can't stop yourself from

1:25:27.020 --> 1:25:31.240
 fully living out its behavioral or emotional consequences.

1:25:31.240 --> 1:25:33.020
 Right, like you have no, once you,

1:25:33.020 --> 1:25:35.060
 mindfulness, you know,

1:25:35.060 --> 1:25:38.420
 arguably gives you another degree of freedom here.

1:25:38.420 --> 1:25:39.320
 It doesn't give you free will,

1:25:39.320 --> 1:25:41.160
 but it gives you some other game to play

1:25:41.160 --> 1:25:43.820
 with respect to the emotional

1:25:43.820 --> 1:25:46.260
 and behavioral imperatives of thoughts.

1:25:46.260 --> 1:25:50.420
 But short of that, I mean,

1:25:50.420 --> 1:25:52.220
 the reason why mindfulness doesn't give you free will

1:25:52.220 --> 1:25:53.620
 is because you can't, you know,

1:25:53.620 --> 1:25:55.600
 you can't account for why in one moment

1:25:55.600 --> 1:26:00.060
 mindfulness arises and in other moments it doesn't, right?

1:26:00.060 --> 1:26:03.500
 But a different process is initiated

1:26:03.500 --> 1:26:06.820
 once you can practice in that way.

1:26:06.820 --> 1:26:08.860
 Well, if I could push back for a second.

1:26:08.860 --> 1:26:11.120
 By the way, I just have this thought bubble

1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:14.100
 popping up all the time of just two recent chimps

1:26:14.100 --> 1:26:16.740
 arguing about the nature of consciousness.

1:26:16.740 --> 1:26:17.860
 It's kind of hilarious.

1:26:17.860 --> 1:26:20.500
 So on that thread, you know,

1:26:21.420 --> 1:26:22.900
 if we're, even before Einstein,

1:26:22.900 --> 1:26:24.340
 let's say before Einstein,

1:26:24.340 --> 1:26:27.060
 we were to conceive about traveling

1:26:27.060 --> 1:26:32.060
 from point A to point B, say some point in the future,

1:26:32.420 --> 1:26:34.940
 we are able to realize through engineering

1:26:34.940 --> 1:26:39.380
 a way which is consistent with Einstein's theory

1:26:39.380 --> 1:26:40.380
 that you can have wormholes.

1:26:40.380 --> 1:26:42.780
 You can travel from one point to another

1:26:42.780 --> 1:26:44.420
 faster than the speed of light.

1:26:46.260 --> 1:26:49.480
 And that would, I think, completely change our conception

1:26:49.480 --> 1:26:52.900
 of what it means to travel in the physical space.

1:26:52.900 --> 1:26:57.420
 And that completely transform our ability.

1:26:57.420 --> 1:26:59.780
 You talk about causality, but here let's just focus

1:26:59.780 --> 1:27:03.400
 on what it means to travel through physical space.

1:27:03.400 --> 1:27:08.160
 Don't you think it's possible that there will be inventions

1:27:08.160 --> 1:27:11.300
 or leaps in understanding about reality

1:27:11.300 --> 1:27:15.980
 that will allow us to see free will as actually,

1:27:15.980 --> 1:27:19.340
 like us humans somehow may be linked

1:27:19.340 --> 1:27:21.380
 to this idea of consciousness,

1:27:21.380 --> 1:27:24.500
 are actually able to be authors of our actions?

1:27:25.580 --> 1:27:29.500
 It is a nonstarter for me conceptually.

1:27:29.500 --> 1:27:30.940
 It's a little bit like saying,

1:27:33.060 --> 1:27:35.920
 could there be some breakthrough that will cause us

1:27:35.920 --> 1:27:40.180
 to realize that circles are really square

1:27:40.180 --> 1:27:43.040
 or the circles are not really round, right?

1:27:43.040 --> 1:27:47.860
 No, a circle is what we mean by a perfectly round form.

1:27:47.860 --> 1:27:52.460
 It's not on the table to be revised.

1:27:52.460 --> 1:27:55.060
 And so I would say the same thing about consciousness.

1:27:55.060 --> 1:27:58.940
 It's just like saying, is there some breakthrough

1:27:58.940 --> 1:28:00.980
 that would get us to realize that consciousness

1:28:00.980 --> 1:28:02.660
 is really an illusion?

1:28:02.660 --> 1:28:06.540
 I'm saying no, because the experience of an illusion

1:28:06.540 --> 1:28:09.020
 is as much a demonstration of what I'm calling consciousness

1:28:09.020 --> 1:28:10.380
 as anything else, right?

1:28:10.380 --> 1:28:11.420
 That is consciousness.

1:28:12.480 --> 1:28:15.340
 With free will, it's a similar problem.

1:28:15.340 --> 1:28:20.340
 It's like, again, it comes down to a picture of causality

1:28:22.620 --> 1:28:27.020
 and there's no other picture on offer.

1:28:27.020 --> 1:28:31.700
 And what's more, I know what it's like

1:28:31.700 --> 1:28:36.540
 on the experiential side to lose the thing

1:28:36.540 --> 1:28:39.060
 to which it is clearly anchored, right?

1:28:39.060 --> 1:28:41.660
 Like the feel, like it doesn't feel,

1:28:41.660 --> 1:28:43.740
 and this is the question that almost nobody asked.

1:28:43.740 --> 1:28:46.520
 People who are debating me on the topic of free will,

1:28:47.860 --> 1:28:51.980
 I'm, at 15 minute intervals, I'm making a claim

1:28:51.980 --> 1:28:53.500
 that I don't feel this thing,

1:28:53.500 --> 1:28:58.220
 and they never become interested in,

1:28:58.220 --> 1:28:59.220
 well, what's that like?

1:28:59.220 --> 1:29:02.100
 Like, okay, so you're actually saying you don't,

1:29:02.100 --> 1:29:05.880
 this thing isn't true for you empirically.

1:29:05.880 --> 1:29:07.280
 It's not just, because most people

1:29:07.280 --> 1:29:11.140
 who don't believe in free will philosophically

1:29:11.140 --> 1:29:15.120
 also believe that we're condemned to experience it.

1:29:15.120 --> 1:29:19.080
 Like, you just, you can't live without this feeling, so.

1:29:19.080 --> 1:29:21.240
 So you're actually saying you're able

1:29:21.240 --> 1:29:26.240
 to experience the absence of the illusion of free will?

1:29:27.040 --> 1:29:28.040
 Yes, yes.

1:29:28.040 --> 1:29:32.600
 For, are we talking about a few minutes at a time,

1:29:32.600 --> 1:29:37.600
 or is this, does it require a lot of work, a meditation,

1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:41.120
 or are you literally able to load that into your mind

1:29:41.120 --> 1:29:42.080
 and like play that moment?

1:29:42.080 --> 1:29:44.640
 Right now, right now, just in this conversation.

1:29:44.640 --> 1:29:48.180
 So it's not absolutely continuous,

1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:51.580
 but it's whenever I pay attention.

1:29:51.580 --> 1:29:53.800
 It's like, and I would say the same thing

1:29:53.800 --> 1:29:56.760
 for the illusoriness of the self in the sense,

1:29:56.760 --> 1:29:58.920
 and again, we haven't talked about this, so.

1:29:58.920 --> 1:30:01.640
 Can you still have the self and not have the free will

1:30:01.640 --> 1:30:02.480
 in mind at the same time?

1:30:02.480 --> 1:30:03.920
 Do they go at the same time?

1:30:03.920 --> 1:30:06.520
 This is the same, yeah, it's the same thing.

1:30:06.520 --> 1:30:08.760
 They're always holding hands when they walk out the door.

1:30:08.760 --> 1:30:10.600
 There really are two sides at the same coin.

1:30:10.600 --> 1:30:13.320
 But it's just, it comes down to what it's like

1:30:14.240 --> 1:30:16.520
 to try to get to the end of this sentence,

1:30:16.520 --> 1:30:18.920
 or what it's like to finally decide

1:30:18.920 --> 1:30:20.400
 that it's been long enough

1:30:20.400 --> 1:30:22.160
 and now I need another sip of water, right?

1:30:22.160 --> 1:30:25.860
 If I'm paying attention, now, if I'm not paying attention,

1:30:25.860 --> 1:30:28.720
 I'm probably, I'm captured by some other thought

1:30:28.720 --> 1:30:30.720
 and that feels a certain way, right?

1:30:30.720 --> 1:30:32.280
 And so that's not, it's not vivid,

1:30:32.280 --> 1:30:35.540
 but if I try to make vivid this experience of just,

1:30:35.540 --> 1:30:38.240
 okay, I'm finally gonna experience free will.

1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:40.440
 I'm gonna notice my free will, right?

1:30:40.440 --> 1:30:43.240
 Like it's gotta be here, everyone's talking about it.

1:30:43.240 --> 1:30:44.080
 Where is it?

1:30:44.080 --> 1:30:45.760
 I'm gonna pay attention to, I'm gonna look for it.

1:30:45.760 --> 1:30:48.600
 And I'm gonna create a circumstance

1:30:48.600 --> 1:30:52.200
 that is where it has to be most robust, right?

1:30:52.200 --> 1:30:54.660
 I'm not rushed to make this decision.

1:30:54.660 --> 1:30:57.060
 I'm not, it's not a reflex.

1:30:57.060 --> 1:30:58.640
 I'm not under pressure.

1:30:58.640 --> 1:30:59.940
 I'm gonna take as long as I want.

1:30:59.940 --> 1:31:02.960
 I'm going to decide, it's not trivial.

1:31:02.960 --> 1:31:04.760
 Like, so it's not just like reaching with my left hand

1:31:04.760 --> 1:31:05.680
 or reaching with my right hand.

1:31:05.680 --> 1:31:07.720
 People don't like those examples for some reason.

1:31:07.720 --> 1:31:09.240
 Let's make a big decision.

1:31:09.240 --> 1:31:14.240
 Like, where should, what should my next podcast be on, right?

1:31:16.340 --> 1:31:18.560
 Who do I invite on the next podcast?

1:31:18.560 --> 1:31:20.600
 What is it like to make that decision?

1:31:20.600 --> 1:31:22.800
 When I pay attention,

1:31:22.800 --> 1:31:26.680
 there is no evidence of free will anywhere in sight.

1:31:26.680 --> 1:31:28.160
 It's like, it doesn't feel like,

1:31:28.160 --> 1:31:31.200
 it feels profoundly mysterious

1:31:31.200 --> 1:31:33.920
 to be going back between two people.

1:31:33.920 --> 1:31:37.600
 Like, is it gonna be person A or person B?

1:31:37.600 --> 1:31:40.240
 Got all my reasons for A and all my reasons why not

1:31:40.240 --> 1:31:41.240
 and all my reasons for B.

1:31:41.240 --> 1:31:43.960
 And there's some math going on there

1:31:43.960 --> 1:31:46.440
 that I'm not even privy to

1:31:46.440 --> 1:31:49.380
 where certain concerns are trumping others.

1:31:49.380 --> 1:31:52.880
 And at a certain point, I just decide.

1:31:52.880 --> 1:31:56.020
 And yes, you can say I'm the node in the network

1:31:56.020 --> 1:31:57.560
 that has made that decision, absolutely.

1:31:57.560 --> 1:32:00.360
 I'm not saying it's being piped to me from elsewhere,

1:32:00.360 --> 1:32:04.560
 but the feeling of what it's like to make that decision

1:32:04.560 --> 1:32:09.560
 is totally without a sense,

1:32:11.280 --> 1:32:15.080
 a real sense of agency

1:32:15.080 --> 1:32:18.720
 because something simply emerges.

1:32:18.720 --> 1:32:22.400
 It's literally as tenuous as

1:32:22.400 --> 1:32:26.020
 what's the next sound I'm going to hear, right?

1:32:26.020 --> 1:32:29.440
 Or what's the next thought that's gonna appear?

1:32:29.440 --> 1:32:32.320
 And it just, something just appears, you know?

1:32:32.320 --> 1:32:34.680
 And if something appears to cancel that something,

1:32:34.680 --> 1:32:37.760
 like if I say, I'm gonna invite her

1:32:37.760 --> 1:32:39.360
 and then I'm about to send the email

1:32:39.360 --> 1:32:42.560
 and then I think, oh, no, no, no, I can't do that.

1:32:42.560 --> 1:32:45.240
 There was a thing in that New York article I read

1:32:45.240 --> 1:32:47.700
 that I gotta talk to this guy, right?

1:32:47.700 --> 1:32:49.740
 That pivot at the last second,

1:32:49.740 --> 1:32:53.960
 you can make it as muscular as you want.

1:32:53.960 --> 1:32:56.000
 It always just comes out of the darkness.

1:32:56.000 --> 1:32:57.800
 It's always mysterious.

1:32:57.800 --> 1:32:59.440
 So right, when you try to pin it down,

1:32:59.440 --> 1:33:02.000
 you really can't ever find that free will.

1:33:02.000 --> 1:33:06.160
 If you construct an experiment for yourself

1:33:06.160 --> 1:33:07.920
 and you're trying to really find that moment

1:33:07.920 --> 1:33:11.760
 when you're actually making that controlled author decision,

1:33:11.760 --> 1:33:12.800
 it's very difficult to do.

1:33:12.800 --> 1:33:15.920
 And we're still, we're still, we know at this point

1:33:15.920 --> 1:33:18.280
 that if we were scanning your brain

1:33:18.280 --> 1:33:23.280
 in some podcast guest choosing experiment, right?

1:33:24.120 --> 1:33:27.040
 We know at this point we would be privy

1:33:27.040 --> 1:33:29.520
 to who you're going to pick before you are,

1:33:29.520 --> 1:33:30.800
 you the conscious agent.

1:33:30.800 --> 1:33:33.120
 If we could, again, this is operationally

1:33:33.120 --> 1:33:34.280
 a little hard to conduct,

1:33:34.280 --> 1:33:36.880
 but there's enough data now to know

1:33:36.880 --> 1:33:41.440
 that something very much like this cartoon is in fact true

1:33:42.800 --> 1:33:45.260
 and will ultimately be undeniable for people.

1:33:46.120 --> 1:33:49.480
 They'll be able to do it on themselves with some app.

1:33:51.680 --> 1:33:54.680
 If you're deciding what to, you know,

1:33:54.680 --> 1:33:56.840
 where to go for dinner or who to have on your podcast

1:33:56.840 --> 1:33:58.840
 or ultimately, you know, who to marry, right?

1:33:58.840 --> 1:34:00.960
 Or what city to move to, right?

1:34:00.960 --> 1:34:02.800
 Like you can make it as big

1:34:02.800 --> 1:34:04.600
 or as small a decision as you want.

1:34:05.600 --> 1:34:08.000
 We could be scanning your brain in real time

1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:12.580
 and at a point where you still think you're uncommitted,

1:34:12.580 --> 1:34:17.080
 we would be able to say with arbitrary accuracy,

1:34:17.080 --> 1:34:20.840
 all right, Lex is, he's moving to Austin, right?

1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:21.680
 I didn't choose that.

1:34:21.680 --> 1:34:23.800
 Yeah, he was choosing, it was gonna be Austin

1:34:23.800 --> 1:34:24.800
 or it was gonna be Miami.

1:34:24.800 --> 1:34:27.760
 He got, he's catching one of these two waves,

1:34:27.760 --> 1:34:29.240
 but it's gonna be Austin.

1:34:29.240 --> 1:34:31.800
 And at a point where you subjectively,

1:34:31.800 --> 1:34:34.200
 if we could ask you, you would say,

1:34:34.200 --> 1:34:36.940
 oh no, I'm still working over here.

1:34:36.940 --> 1:34:40.720
 I'm still thinking, I'm still considering my options.

1:34:40.720 --> 1:34:43.040
 And you've spoken to this,

1:34:43.040 --> 1:34:45.520
 in you thinking about other stuff in the world,

1:34:45.520 --> 1:34:49.920
 it's been very useful to step away

1:34:49.920 --> 1:34:51.480
 from this illusion of free will.

1:34:51.480 --> 1:34:54.140
 And you argue that it's probably makes a better world

1:34:54.140 --> 1:34:55.400
 because it can be compassionate

1:34:55.400 --> 1:34:56.880
 and empathetic towards others.

1:34:56.880 --> 1:34:58.380
 And towards oneself.

1:34:58.380 --> 1:34:59.220
 Towards oneself.

1:34:59.220 --> 1:35:01.880
 I mean, radically toward others

1:35:01.880 --> 1:35:05.780
 in that literally hate makes no sense anymore.

1:35:05.780 --> 1:35:06.800
 I mean, there are certain things

1:35:06.800 --> 1:35:10.920
 you can really be worried about, really want to oppose.

1:35:10.920 --> 1:35:12.000
 Really, I mean, I'm not saying

1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:13.800
 you'd never have to kill another person.

1:35:13.800 --> 1:35:16.380
 Like, I mean, self defense is still a thing, right?

1:35:16.380 --> 1:35:21.380
 But the idea that you're ever confronting anything

1:35:22.180 --> 1:35:25.560
 other than a force of nature in the end

1:35:25.560 --> 1:35:26.740
 goes out the window, right?

1:35:26.740 --> 1:35:29.040
 Or does go out the window when you really pay attention.

1:35:29.040 --> 1:35:33.400
 I'm not saying that this would be easy to grok

1:35:33.400 --> 1:35:38.340
 if someone kills a member of your family.

1:35:38.340 --> 1:35:39.560
 I'm not saying you can just listen

1:35:39.560 --> 1:35:40.880
 to my 90 minutes on free will

1:35:40.880 --> 1:35:42.360
 and then you should be able to see that person

1:35:42.360 --> 1:35:46.560
 as identical to a grizzly bear or a virus.

1:35:46.560 --> 1:35:49.740
 Because there's so, I mean, we are so evolved

1:35:49.740 --> 1:35:54.740
 to deal with one another as fellow primates

1:35:54.740 --> 1:35:59.740
 and as agents, but it's, yeah,

1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:01.960
 when you're talking about the possibility

1:36:01.960 --> 1:36:05.800
 of, you know, Christian, you know,

1:36:05.800 --> 1:36:08.280
 truly Christian forgiveness, right?

1:36:08.280 --> 1:36:13.280
 It's like, you know, as testified to by, you know,

1:36:14.080 --> 1:36:19.080
 various saints of that flavor over the millennia.

1:36:19.080 --> 1:36:24.080
 Yeah, that is, the doorway to that is to recognize

1:36:24.080 --> 1:36:28.080
 that no one really at bottom made themselves.

1:36:28.080 --> 1:36:31.560
 And therefore everyone, what we're seeing really

1:36:31.560 --> 1:36:34.440
 are differences in luck in the world.

1:36:34.440 --> 1:36:37.160
 We're seeing people who are very, very lucky

1:36:37.160 --> 1:36:38.880
 to have had good parents and good genes

1:36:38.880 --> 1:36:41.480
 and to be in good societies and had good opportunities

1:36:41.480 --> 1:36:44.080
 and to be intelligent and to be, you know,

1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:47.080
 not as intelligent as they were in the past.

1:36:47.080 --> 1:36:50.000
 And to be, you know, not sociopathic,

1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:53.080
 like none of it is on them.

1:36:53.080 --> 1:36:56.640
 They're just reaping the fruits of one lottery

1:36:56.640 --> 1:36:59.200
 after another, and then showing up in the world

1:36:59.200 --> 1:37:00.140
 on that basis.

1:37:01.920 --> 1:37:04.160
 And then so it is with, you know,

1:37:04.160 --> 1:37:06.480
 every malevolent asshole out there, right?

1:37:06.480 --> 1:37:09.560
 He or she didn't make themself.

1:37:11.040 --> 1:37:14.080
 Even if that weren't possible,

1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:18.600
 the utility for self compassion is also enormous

1:37:18.600 --> 1:37:21.760
 because it's, when you just look at what it's like

1:37:21.760 --> 1:37:26.760
 to regret something or to feel shame about something

1:37:27.520 --> 1:37:30.160
 or feel deep embarrassment, these states of mind

1:37:30.160 --> 1:37:34.640
 are some of the most deranging experiences anyone has.

1:37:34.640 --> 1:37:39.640
 And the indelible reaction to them,

1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:41.960
 you know, the memory of the thing you said,

1:37:41.960 --> 1:37:44.040
 you know, the memory of the wedding toast you gave

1:37:44.040 --> 1:37:47.120
 20 years ago that was just mortifying, right?

1:37:47.120 --> 1:37:50.280
 The fact that that can still make you hate yourself, right?

1:37:50.280 --> 1:37:52.360
 And like that psychologically,

1:37:52.360 --> 1:37:56.280
 that is a knot that can be untied, right?

1:37:56.280 --> 1:37:57.340
 Speak for yourself, Sam.

1:37:57.340 --> 1:37:58.180
 Yeah, yeah.

1:37:58.180 --> 1:37:59.000
 So clearly you're not.

1:37:59.000 --> 1:37:59.840
 You gave a great toast.

1:37:59.840 --> 1:38:01.160
 It was my toast that mortified me.

1:38:01.160 --> 1:38:02.880
 No, no, that's not what I was referring to.

1:38:02.880 --> 1:38:07.320
 I'm deeply appreciative in the same way

1:38:07.320 --> 1:38:10.360
 that you're referring to of every moment I'm alive,

1:38:10.360 --> 1:38:14.360
 but I'm also powered by self hate often.

1:38:15.400 --> 1:38:18.080
 Like several things in this conversation already

1:38:18.080 --> 1:38:21.080
 that I've spoken, I'll be thinking about,

1:38:21.080 --> 1:38:23.080
 like that was the dumbest thing.

1:38:23.080 --> 1:38:26.260
 You're sitting in front of Sam Harris and you said that.

1:38:26.260 --> 1:38:29.300
 So like that, but that somehow creates

1:38:29.300 --> 1:38:30.640
 a richer experience for me.

1:38:30.640 --> 1:38:33.360
 Like I've actually come to accept that as a nice feature

1:38:33.360 --> 1:38:35.360
 however my brain was built.

1:38:35.360 --> 1:38:37.340
 I don't think I want to let go of that.

1:38:37.340 --> 1:38:39.520
 Well, the thing you, I think the thing you want to let go of

1:38:39.520 --> 1:38:44.520
 is the suffering associated with it.

1:38:46.400 --> 1:38:51.400
 So like, so for me, so psychologically and ethically,

1:38:53.440 --> 1:38:55.240
 all of this is very interesting.

1:38:55.240 --> 1:38:56.560
 So I don't think we ever,

1:38:56.560 --> 1:38:59.500
 we should ever get rid of things like anger, right?

1:38:59.500 --> 1:39:02.720
 So like hatred is, hatred is divorcible from anger

1:39:02.720 --> 1:39:07.720
 in the sense that hatred is this enduring state where,

1:39:07.920 --> 1:39:09.100
 you know, whether you're hating somebody else

1:39:09.100 --> 1:39:11.480
 or hating yourself, it is just,

1:39:11.480 --> 1:39:15.900
 it is toxic and durable and ultimately useless, right?

1:39:15.900 --> 1:39:19.520
 Like it becomes, it becomes self nullifying, right?

1:39:19.520 --> 1:39:23.280
 Like you become less capable as a person

1:39:23.280 --> 1:39:24.480
 to solve any of your problems.

1:39:24.480 --> 1:39:26.680
 It's not, it's not instrumental in solving the problem

1:39:26.680 --> 1:39:29.920
 that is, that is, is occasioning all this hatred.

1:39:30.880 --> 1:39:34.200
 And anger for the most part isn't either except

1:39:34.200 --> 1:39:37.280
 as a signal of salience that there's a problem, right?

1:39:37.280 --> 1:39:40.280
 So if somebody does something that makes me angry,

1:39:40.280 --> 1:39:44.280
 that just promotes this situation to conscious,

1:39:44.280 --> 1:39:46.960
 conscious attention in a way that is stronger

1:39:46.960 --> 1:39:49.480
 than my not really caring about it, right?

1:39:49.480 --> 1:39:51.440
 And there are things that I think should make us angry

1:39:51.440 --> 1:39:54.520
 in the world and there's the behavior of other people

1:39:54.520 --> 1:39:57.460
 that should make us angry because we should respond to it.

1:39:57.460 --> 1:39:59.120
 And so it is with yourself.

1:39:59.120 --> 1:40:01.840
 If I do something, you know, as a parent,

1:40:01.840 --> 1:40:05.280
 if I do something stupid that harms one of my daughters,

1:40:05.280 --> 1:40:10.280
 right, my belief, my experience of myself

1:40:10.280 --> 1:40:14.400
 and my beliefs about free will close the door to my saying,

1:40:14.400 --> 1:40:16.280
 well, I should have done otherwise in the sense

1:40:16.280 --> 1:40:17.660
 that if I could go back in time,

1:40:17.660 --> 1:40:20.360
 I would have actually effectively done otherwise.

1:40:20.360 --> 1:40:22.840
 No, I would do, given the same causes and conditions,

1:40:22.840 --> 1:40:26.320
 I would do that thing a trillion times in a row, right?

1:40:26.320 --> 1:40:31.320
 But, you know, regret and feeling bad about an outcome

1:40:31.320 --> 1:40:34.600
 are still important to capacities because like, yeah,

1:40:34.600 --> 1:40:37.160
 you know, like I desperately want my daughters

1:40:37.160 --> 1:40:38.720
 to be happy and healthy.

1:40:38.720 --> 1:40:40.360
 So if I've done something, you know,

1:40:40.360 --> 1:40:42.920
 if I crash the car when they're in the car

1:40:42.920 --> 1:40:43.760
 and they get injured, right,

1:40:43.760 --> 1:40:47.680
 and I do it because I was trying to change a song

1:40:47.680 --> 1:40:50.600
 on my playlist or, you know, something stupid,

1:40:50.600 --> 1:40:52.560
 I'm gonna feel like a total asshole.

1:40:53.720 --> 1:40:58.720
 How long do I stew in that feeling of regret?

1:40:58.720 --> 1:41:03.720
 Right, and to like, what utility is there to extract

1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:05.520
 out of this error signal?

1:41:05.520 --> 1:41:06.920
 And then what do I do?

1:41:06.920 --> 1:41:10.480
 We're always faced with the question of what to do next,

1:41:10.480 --> 1:41:13.520
 right, and how to best do that thing,

1:41:13.520 --> 1:41:15.240
 that necessary thing next.

1:41:15.240 --> 1:41:20.240
 And how much wellbeing can we experience while doing it?

1:41:22.360 --> 1:41:27.360
 Like how miserable do you need to be to solve a problem

1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:30.360
 in life and to help solve the problems

1:41:30.360 --> 1:41:32.160
 of people closest to you?

1:41:32.160 --> 1:41:33.920
 You know, how miserable do you need to be

1:41:33.920 --> 1:41:36.880
 to get through your to do list today?

1:41:36.880 --> 1:41:41.880
 Ultimately, I think you can be deeply happy

1:41:44.840 --> 1:41:46.720
 going through all of it, right?

1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:51.720
 And even navigating moments that are scary

1:41:51.720 --> 1:41:56.720
 and, you know, really destabilizing to ordinary people.

1:41:56.720 --> 1:42:01.720
 And, I mean, I think, you know, again,

1:42:01.720 --> 1:42:05.560
 I'm always up kind of at the edge of my own capacities here

1:42:05.560 --> 1:42:07.600
 and there are all kinds of things that stress me out

1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:10.040
 and worry me and I'm especially something if it's,

1:42:10.040 --> 1:42:11.400
 you're gonna tell me it's something with, you know,

1:42:11.400 --> 1:42:14.000
 the health of one of my kids, you know,

1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:16.600
 it's very hard for me, like, it's very hard for me

1:42:16.600 --> 1:42:19.200
 to be truly equanimous around that.

1:42:19.200 --> 1:42:22.120
 But equanimity is so useful

1:42:23.080 --> 1:42:26.080
 the moment you're in response mode, right?

1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:30.080
 Because, I mean, the ordinary experience for me

1:42:30.080 --> 1:42:35.080
 of responding to what seems like a medical emergency

1:42:35.080 --> 1:42:40.080
 for one of my kids is to be obviously super energized

1:42:40.680 --> 1:42:44.360
 by concern to respond to that emergency.

1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:47.240
 But then once I'm responding to that emergency,

1:42:47.240 --> 1:42:50.200
 but then once I'm responding,

1:42:50.200 --> 1:42:54.920
 all of my fear and agitation and worry and, oh my God,

1:42:54.920 --> 1:42:58.120
 what if this is really something terrible?

1:42:58.120 --> 1:43:01.880
 But finding any of those thoughts compelling,

1:43:01.880 --> 1:43:05.480
 that only diminishes my capacity as a father

1:43:05.480 --> 1:43:08.280
 to be good company while we navigate

1:43:08.280 --> 1:43:11.440
 this really turbulent passage, you know?

1:43:11.440 --> 1:43:12.480
 As you're saying this actually,

1:43:12.480 --> 1:43:14.600
 one guy comes to mind, which is Elon Musk.

1:43:14.600 --> 1:43:17.200
 One of the really impressive things to me

1:43:17.200 --> 1:43:19.920
 was to observe how many dramatic things

1:43:19.920 --> 1:43:22.400
 he has to deal with throughout the day at work,

1:43:22.400 --> 1:43:26.600
 but also if you look through his life, family too,

1:43:26.600 --> 1:43:30.440
 and how he's very much actually, as you're describing,

1:43:30.440 --> 1:43:33.000
 basically a practitioner of this way of thought,

1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:36.680
 which is you're not in control.

1:43:37.680 --> 1:43:39.880
 You're basically responding

1:43:39.880 --> 1:43:41.360
 no matter how traumatic the event,

1:43:41.360 --> 1:43:43.880
 and there's no reason to sort of linger on the,

1:43:44.880 --> 1:43:46.840
 on the negative feelings around that.

1:43:46.840 --> 1:43:51.840
 Well, so, I mean, he, but he's in a very specific situation,

1:43:52.080 --> 1:43:57.080
 which is unlike normal life,

1:43:57.880 --> 1:43:59.080
 you know, even his normal life,

1:43:59.080 --> 1:44:00.800
 but normal life for most people,

1:44:00.800 --> 1:44:02.720
 because when you just think of like, you know,

1:44:02.720 --> 1:44:04.080
 he's running so many businesses,

1:44:04.080 --> 1:44:06.080
 and he's, they're very, they're not,

1:44:06.080 --> 1:44:08.640
 they're non, highly nonstandard businesses.

1:44:08.640 --> 1:44:12.440
 So what he's seen is everything that gets to him

1:44:12.440 --> 1:44:13.880
 is some kind of emergency.

1:44:13.880 --> 1:44:15.000
 Like it wouldn't be getting to him.

1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:16.600
 If it needs his attention,

1:44:16.600 --> 1:44:17.960
 there's a fire somewhere.

1:44:17.960 --> 1:44:20.760
 So he's constantly responding to fires

1:44:20.760 --> 1:44:22.720
 that have to be put out.

1:44:22.720 --> 1:44:25.480
 So there's no default expectation

1:44:25.480 --> 1:44:27.360
 that there shouldn't be a fire, right?

1:44:27.360 --> 1:44:29.600
 But in our normal lives, we live,

1:44:29.600 --> 1:44:31.720
 most of us, I mean, most of us who are lucky, right?

1:44:31.720 --> 1:44:33.200
 Not everyone, obviously on earth,

1:44:33.200 --> 1:44:36.600
 but most of us who are at some kind of cruising altitude

1:44:36.600 --> 1:44:39.040
 in terms of our lives,

1:44:39.040 --> 1:44:40.440
 where we're reasonably healthy,

1:44:40.440 --> 1:44:42.120
 and life is reasonably orderly,

1:44:42.120 --> 1:44:44.360
 and the political apparatus around us

1:44:44.360 --> 1:44:47.440
 is reasonably functionable, functional,

1:44:47.440 --> 1:44:48.280
 functionable.

1:44:48.280 --> 1:44:50.160
 So I said, functionable for the first time in my life

1:44:50.160 --> 1:44:51.360
 through no free will of my own.

1:44:51.360 --> 1:44:53.080
 Say like, I noticed those errors,

1:44:53.080 --> 1:44:56.240
 and they do not feel like agency,

1:44:56.240 --> 1:44:59.800
 and nor does the success of an utterance feel like agency.

1:45:01.600 --> 1:45:06.400
 He, when you're looking at normal human life, right,

1:45:06.400 --> 1:45:10.360
 where you're just trying to be happy and healthy,

1:45:10.360 --> 1:45:13.040
 and get your work done,

1:45:13.040 --> 1:45:14.520
 there's this default expectation

1:45:14.520 --> 1:45:16.400
 that there shouldn't be fires.

1:45:16.400 --> 1:45:18.960
 People shouldn't be getting sick or injured.

1:45:20.560 --> 1:45:23.720
 We shouldn't be losing vast amounts of our resources.

1:45:23.720 --> 1:45:27.480
 We should, like, so when something really stark

1:45:27.480 --> 1:45:28.760
 like that happens,

1:45:31.520 --> 1:45:34.800
 people don't have a, people don't have that muscle

1:45:34.800 --> 1:45:37.560
 that they're, like, I've been responding to emergencies

1:45:37.560 --> 1:45:42.240
 all day long, seven days a week in business mode,

1:45:42.240 --> 1:45:44.160
 and so I have a very thick skin.

1:45:44.160 --> 1:45:45.680
 This is just another one.

1:45:45.680 --> 1:45:47.320
 I'm not expecting anything else

1:45:47.320 --> 1:45:48.720
 when I wake up in the morning.

1:45:48.720 --> 1:45:50.880
 No, we have this default sense that,

1:45:52.280 --> 1:45:54.440
 I mean, honestly, most of us have the default sense

1:45:54.440 --> 1:45:57.120
 that we aren't gonna die, right,

1:45:57.120 --> 1:45:59.680
 or that we should, like, maybe we're not gonna die.

1:45:59.680 --> 1:46:02.960
 Right, like, death denial really is a thing.

1:46:02.960 --> 1:46:06.360
 You know, we're, and you can see it,

1:46:06.360 --> 1:46:09.840
 just like I can see when I reach for this bottle

1:46:09.840 --> 1:46:11.600
 that I was expecting it to be solid,

1:46:11.600 --> 1:46:13.640
 because when it isn't solid, when it's a hologram

1:46:13.640 --> 1:46:16.720
 and I just, my fist closes on itself,

1:46:16.720 --> 1:46:18.880
 I'm damn surprised.

1:46:18.880 --> 1:46:22.120
 People are damn surprised to find out

1:46:22.120 --> 1:46:24.680
 that they're going to die, to find out that they're sick,

1:46:24.680 --> 1:46:27.640
 to find out that someone they love has died

1:46:27.640 --> 1:46:28.640
 or is going to die.

1:46:28.640 --> 1:46:32.520
 So it's like, the fact that we are surprised

1:46:32.520 --> 1:46:36.360
 by any of that shows us that we're living at a,

1:46:36.360 --> 1:46:41.360
 we're living in a mode that is, you know,

1:46:45.280 --> 1:46:47.240
 we're perpetually diverting ourselves

1:46:47.240 --> 1:46:50.520
 from some facts that should be obvious, right,

1:46:50.520 --> 1:46:55.000
 and the more salient we can make them,

1:46:55.000 --> 1:46:57.720
 you know, the more, I mean, in the case of death,

1:46:57.720 --> 1:47:01.080
 it's a matter of being able to get one's priorities straight.

1:47:01.080 --> 1:47:04.760
 I mean, the moment, again, this is hard for everybody,

1:47:04.760 --> 1:47:06.600
 even those who are really in the business

1:47:06.600 --> 1:47:07.480
 of paying attention to it,

1:47:07.480 --> 1:47:12.360
 but the moment you realize that every circumstance

1:47:12.360 --> 1:47:15.720
 is finite, right, you've got a certain number of,

1:47:15.720 --> 1:47:17.120
 you know, you've got whatever, whatever it is,

1:47:17.120 --> 1:47:20.720
 8,000 days left in a normal span of life,

1:47:21.880 --> 1:47:24.320
 and 8,000 is a, sounds like a big number,

1:47:24.320 --> 1:47:25.760
 it's not that big a number, right,

1:47:25.760 --> 1:47:29.480
 so it's just like, and then you can decide

1:47:29.480 --> 1:47:31.600
 how you want to go through life

1:47:31.600 --> 1:47:34.520
 and how you want to experience each one of those days,

1:47:34.520 --> 1:47:37.640
 and so I was, back to our jumping off point,

1:47:39.080 --> 1:47:44.080
 I would argue that you don't want to feel self hatred ever.

1:47:44.120 --> 1:47:49.040
 I would argue that you don't want to really,

1:47:53.240 --> 1:47:55.280
 really grasp onto any of those moments

1:47:55.280 --> 1:47:58.880
 where you are internalizing the fact

1:47:58.880 --> 1:48:01.440
 that you just made an error, you've embarrassed yourself,

1:48:01.440 --> 1:48:03.760
 that something didn't go the way you wanted it to.

1:48:03.760 --> 1:48:05.960
 I think you want to treat all of those moments

1:48:05.960 --> 1:48:06.960
 very, very lightly.

1:48:06.960 --> 1:48:10.800
 You want to extract the actionable information.

1:48:10.800 --> 1:48:11.920
 It's something to learn.

1:48:11.920 --> 1:48:16.920
 Oh, you know, I learned that when I prepare

1:48:17.040 --> 1:48:18.440
 in a certain way, it works better

1:48:18.440 --> 1:48:20.000
 than when I prepare in some other way,

1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:22.320
 or don't prepare, right, like yes,

1:48:22.320 --> 1:48:25.560
 lesson learned, you know, and do that differently,

1:48:25.560 --> 1:48:34.560
 but yeah, I mean, so many of us have spent so much time

1:48:35.040 --> 1:48:40.040
 with a very dysfunctional and hostile

1:48:42.320 --> 1:48:46.080
 and even hateful inner voice

1:48:46.080 --> 1:48:48.320
 governing a lot of our self talk

1:48:48.320 --> 1:48:51.800
 and a lot of just our default way of being with ourselves.

1:48:51.800 --> 1:48:54.160
 I mean, the privacy of our own minds,

1:48:54.160 --> 1:48:58.080
 we're in the company of a real jerk a lot of the time,

1:48:58.080 --> 1:49:03.080
 and that can't help but affect,

1:49:03.280 --> 1:49:05.600
 I mean, forget about just your own sense of wellbeing.

1:49:05.600 --> 1:49:08.560
 It can't help but limit what you're capable of

1:49:08.560 --> 1:49:10.560
 in the world with other people.

1:49:10.560 --> 1:49:12.120
 I'll have to really think about that.

1:49:12.120 --> 1:49:15.080
 I just take pride that my jerk, my inner voice jerk

1:49:15.080 --> 1:49:18.120
 is much less of a jerk than somebody like David Goggins,

1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:20.120
 who's like screaming in his ear constantly.

1:49:20.120 --> 1:49:23.160
 So I have a relativist kind of perspective

1:49:23.160 --> 1:49:25.760
 that it's not as bad as that at least.

1:49:25.760 --> 1:49:28.440
 Well, having a sense of humor also helps, you know,

1:49:28.440 --> 1:49:29.480
 it's just like, it's not,

1:49:29.480 --> 1:49:32.600
 the stakes are never quite what you think they are.

1:49:32.600 --> 1:49:34.600
 And even when they are, I mean,

1:49:34.600 --> 1:49:38.680
 it's just the difference between being able

1:49:38.680 --> 1:49:41.000
 to see the comedy of it rather than,

1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:44.520
 because again, there's this sort of dark star

1:49:44.520 --> 1:49:49.120
 of self absorption that pulls everything into it, right?

1:49:49.120 --> 1:49:54.120
 And that's the algorithm you don't want to run.

1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:57.600
 So it's like, you just want things to be good.

1:49:57.600 --> 1:50:01.000
 So like, just push the concern out there,

1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:04.880
 like not have the collapse of,

1:50:04.880 --> 1:50:06.640
 oh my God, what does this say about me?

1:50:06.640 --> 1:50:08.760
 It's just like, what does this say about,

1:50:08.760 --> 1:50:11.240
 how do we make this meal that we're all having together

1:50:11.240 --> 1:50:15.640
 as fun and as useful as possible?

1:50:15.640 --> 1:50:17.520
 And you're saying in terms of propulsion systems,

1:50:17.520 --> 1:50:19.680
 you recommend humor is a good spaceship

1:50:19.680 --> 1:50:23.680
 to escape the gravitational field of that darkness.

1:50:23.680 --> 1:50:24.960
 Well, that certainly helps, yeah.

1:50:24.960 --> 1:50:29.640
 Yeah, well, let me ask you a little bit about ego and fame,

1:50:29.640 --> 1:50:33.400
 which is very interesting the way you're talking,

1:50:33.400 --> 1:50:38.400
 given that you're one of the biggest intellects,

1:50:38.760 --> 1:50:41.520
 living intellects and minds of our time.

1:50:41.520 --> 1:50:44.360
 And there's a lot of people that really love you

1:50:44.360 --> 1:50:49.360
 and almost elevate you to a certain kind of status

1:50:49.400 --> 1:50:50.760
 where you're like the guru.

1:50:50.760 --> 1:50:54.160
 I'm surprised you didn't show up in a robe, in fact.

1:50:54.160 --> 1:50:55.200
 Is there a...

1:50:55.200 --> 1:50:58.600
 A hoodie, isn't that the highest status garment

1:50:58.600 --> 1:50:59.440
 one can wear now?

1:50:59.440 --> 1:51:02.040
 The socially acceptable version of the robe.

1:51:02.040 --> 1:51:04.640
 If you're a billionaire, you wear a hoodie.

1:51:04.640 --> 1:51:07.200
 Is there something you can say about managing

1:51:07.200 --> 1:51:11.480
 the effects of fame on your own mind,

1:51:11.480 --> 1:51:14.600
 on not creating this, you know, when you wake up

1:51:14.600 --> 1:51:18.080
 in the morning, when you look up in the mirror,

1:51:18.080 --> 1:51:23.080
 how do you get your ego not to grow exponentially?

1:51:24.240 --> 1:51:26.280
 Your conception of self to grow exponentially

1:51:26.280 --> 1:51:28.760
 because there's so many people feeding that.

1:51:28.760 --> 1:51:30.200
 Is there something to be said about this?

1:51:30.200 --> 1:51:32.560
 It's really not hard because I mean,

1:51:32.560 --> 1:51:36.240
 I feel like I have a pretty clear sense

1:51:36.240 --> 1:51:39.880
 of my strengths and weaknesses.

1:51:39.880 --> 1:51:42.600
 And I don't feel like it's...

1:51:43.800 --> 1:51:45.840
 I mean, honestly, I don't feel like I suffer

1:51:45.840 --> 1:51:48.560
 from much grandiosity.

1:51:48.560 --> 1:51:51.040
 I mean, I just have a, you know,

1:51:51.040 --> 1:51:52.640
 there's so many things I'm not good at.

1:51:52.640 --> 1:51:53.920
 There's so many things I will, you know,

1:51:53.920 --> 1:51:57.960
 given the remaining 8,000 days at best,

1:51:57.960 --> 1:52:00.040
 I will never get good at.

1:52:00.040 --> 1:52:02.560
 I would love to be good at these things.

1:52:02.560 --> 1:52:05.280
 So it's just, it's easy to feel diminished

1:52:05.280 --> 1:52:08.800
 by comparison with the talents of others.

1:52:08.800 --> 1:52:11.160
 Do you remind yourself of all the things

1:52:11.160 --> 1:52:14.560
 that you're not competent in?

1:52:14.560 --> 1:52:15.400
 I mean, like what is...

1:52:15.400 --> 1:52:17.080
 Well, they're just on display for me every day

1:52:17.080 --> 1:52:19.320
 that I appreciate the talents of others.

1:52:19.320 --> 1:52:20.280
 But you notice them.

1:52:20.280 --> 1:52:22.880
 I'm sure Stalin and Hitler did not notice

1:52:22.880 --> 1:52:25.280
 all the ways in which they were.

1:52:25.280 --> 1:52:28.800
 I mean, this is why absolute power corrupts absolutely

1:52:28.800 --> 1:52:30.800
 is you stop noticing the things

1:52:30.800 --> 1:52:33.720
 in which you're ridiculous and wrong.

1:52:33.720 --> 1:52:36.120
 Right, yeah, no, I am...

1:52:36.120 --> 1:52:37.080
 Not to compare you to Stalin.

1:52:37.080 --> 1:52:40.000
 Yeah, well, I'm sure there's an inner Stalin

1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:41.280
 in there somewhere.

1:52:41.280 --> 1:52:43.640
 Well, we all have, we all carry a baby Stalin with us.

1:52:43.640 --> 1:52:44.840
 He wears better clothes.

1:52:46.960 --> 1:52:49.080
 And I'm not gonna grow that mustache.

1:52:49.080 --> 1:52:50.800
 Those concerns don't map,

1:52:50.800 --> 1:52:53.480
 they don't map onto me for a bunch of reasons.

1:52:53.480 --> 1:52:56.080
 But one is I also have a very peculiar audience.

1:52:56.080 --> 1:52:59.800
 Like I'm just, you know,

1:52:59.800 --> 1:53:01.440
 I've been appreciating this for a few years,

1:53:01.440 --> 1:53:05.880
 but it's, I'm just now beginning to understand

1:53:05.880 --> 1:53:07.680
 that there are many people who have audiences

1:53:07.680 --> 1:53:11.560
 of my size or larger that have a very different experience

1:53:11.560 --> 1:53:13.280
 of having an audience than I do.

1:53:13.280 --> 1:53:18.280
 I have curated for better or worse, a peculiar audience.

1:53:18.960 --> 1:53:23.960
 And the net result of that is virtually any time

1:53:25.880 --> 1:53:28.240
 I say anything of substance,

1:53:28.240 --> 1:53:30.600
 something like half of my audience,

1:53:30.600 --> 1:53:33.080
 my real audience, not haters from outside my audience,

1:53:33.080 --> 1:53:38.080
 but my audience is just revolts over it, right?

1:53:38.320 --> 1:53:41.000
 They just like, oh my God, I can't believe you said it,

1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:43.240
 like you're such a schmuck, right?

1:53:43.240 --> 1:53:47.040
 They revolt with rigor and intellectual sophistication.

1:53:47.040 --> 1:53:49.480
 Or not, or not, but I mean, it's both,

1:53:49.480 --> 1:53:51.040
 but it's like, but people who are like,

1:53:51.040 --> 1:53:53.280
 so it's, I mean, the clearest case is,

1:53:53.280 --> 1:53:55.200
 you know, I have whatever audience I have

1:53:55.200 --> 1:53:56.800
 and then Trump appears on the scene

1:53:56.800 --> 1:54:00.600
 and I discovered that something like 20% of my audience

1:54:00.600 --> 1:54:03.840
 just went straight to Trump and couldn't believe

1:54:03.840 --> 1:54:05.120
 I didn't follow them there.

1:54:05.120 --> 1:54:06.920
 They were just a gas that I didn't see

1:54:06.920 --> 1:54:10.040
 that Trump was obviously exactly what we needed

1:54:10.040 --> 1:54:15.000
 for, to steer the ship of state for the next four years

1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:17.000
 and then four years beyond that.

1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:20.400
 So like, so that's one example.

1:54:20.400 --> 1:54:22.640
 So whenever I said anything about Trump,

1:54:22.640 --> 1:54:25.760
 I would hear from people who loved more or less

1:54:25.760 --> 1:54:28.920
 everything else I was up to and had for years,

1:54:28.920 --> 1:54:33.400
 but everything I said about Trump just gave me pure pain

1:54:33.400 --> 1:54:36.160
 from this quadrant of my audience.

1:54:36.160 --> 1:54:39.560
 But then the same thing happens when I say something

1:54:39.560 --> 1:54:42.000
 about the derangement of the far left.

1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:44.200
 Anything I say about wokeness, right,

1:54:44.200 --> 1:54:48.040
 or identity politics, same kind of punishment signal

1:54:48.040 --> 1:54:51.760
 from, again, people who are core to my audience,

1:54:51.760 --> 1:54:55.680
 like I've read all your books, I'm using your meditation app,

1:54:55.680 --> 1:54:57.920
 I love what you say about science,

1:54:57.920 --> 1:55:00.960
 but you are so wrong about politics and you are,

1:55:00.960 --> 1:55:02.520
 I'm starting to think you're a racist asshole

1:55:02.520 --> 1:55:05.120
 for everything you said about identity politics.

1:55:06.360 --> 1:55:08.960
 And there are so many, the free will topic

1:55:08.960 --> 1:55:12.040
 is just like this, it's like I just,

1:55:12.040 --> 1:55:15.120
 they love what I'm saying about consciousness and the mind

1:55:15.120 --> 1:55:18.280
 and they love to hear me talk about physics with physicists

1:55:18.280 --> 1:55:21.600
 and it's all good, this free will stuff is,

1:55:21.600 --> 1:55:24.440
 I cannot believe you don't see how wrong you are,

1:55:24.440 --> 1:55:26.720
 what a fucking embarrassment you are.

1:55:26.720 --> 1:55:30.320
 So, but I'm starting to notice that there are other people

1:55:30.320 --> 1:55:33.440
 who don't have this experience of having an audience

1:55:33.440 --> 1:55:37.320
 because they have, I mean, just take the Trump woke dichotomy.

1:55:37.320 --> 1:55:41.640
 They just castigated Trump the same way I did,

1:55:41.640 --> 1:55:44.160
 but they never say anything bad about the far left.

1:55:44.160 --> 1:55:46.880
 So they never get this punishment signal or you flip it.

1:55:46.880 --> 1:55:51.880
 They're all about the insanity of critical race theory now.

1:55:51.880 --> 1:55:54.640
 We connect all those dots the same way,

1:55:54.640 --> 1:55:58.320
 but they never really specified what was wrong with Trump

1:55:58.320 --> 1:56:00.360
 or they thought there was a lot right with Trump

1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:02.920
 and they got all the pleasure of that.

1:56:02.920 --> 1:56:06.400
 And so they have much more homogenized audiences.

1:56:07.680 --> 1:56:10.640
 And so my experience, so just to come back

1:56:10.640 --> 1:56:13.360
 to this experience of fame or quasi fame,

1:56:13.360 --> 1:56:16.680
 I mean, it's true, in truth, it's not real fame,

1:56:16.680 --> 1:56:20.200
 but it's still, there's an audience there.

1:56:20.200 --> 1:56:25.200
 It is a, it's now an experience where basically

1:56:26.520 --> 1:56:30.040
 whatever I put out, I notice a ton of negativity

1:56:30.040 --> 1:56:35.040
 coming back at me and it just, it is what it is.

1:56:35.040 --> 1:56:37.680
 I mean, now, it's like, I used to think, wait a minute,

1:56:37.680 --> 1:56:39.840
 there's gotta be some way for me to communicate

1:56:39.840 --> 1:56:43.640
 more clearly here so as not to get this kind of

1:56:45.360 --> 1:56:48.640
 lunatic response from my own audience.

1:56:48.640 --> 1:56:51.480
 From like people who are showing all the signs of,

1:56:51.480 --> 1:56:54.880
 we've been here for years for a reason, right?

1:56:54.880 --> 1:56:56.840
 These are not just trolls.

1:56:56.840 --> 1:56:59.680
 And so I think, okay, I'm gonna take 10 more minutes

1:56:59.680 --> 1:57:04.200
 and really just tell you what should be absolutely clear

1:57:04.200 --> 1:57:05.640
 about what's wrong with Trump, right?

1:57:05.640 --> 1:57:07.160
 I've done this a few times,

1:57:07.160 --> 1:57:09.240
 but I think I gotta do this again.

1:57:09.240 --> 1:57:12.800
 Or wait a minute, how are they not getting

1:57:12.800 --> 1:57:15.360
 that these episodes of police violence

1:57:15.360 --> 1:57:17.880
 are so obviously different from the ones

1:57:17.880 --> 1:57:20.120
 that you can't describe all of them

1:57:20.120 --> 1:57:25.120
 to yet another racist maniac on the police force,

1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:27.120
 killing someone based on his racism.

1:57:29.120 --> 1:57:31.800
 Last time I spoke about this, it was pure pain,

1:57:31.800 --> 1:57:33.920
 but I just gotta try again.

1:57:33.920 --> 1:57:36.880
 Now at a certain point, I mean, I'm starting to feel like,

1:57:36.880 --> 1:57:40.680
 all right, I just, I have to be, I have to cease.

1:57:40.680 --> 1:57:43.160
 Again, it comes back to this expectation

1:57:43.160 --> 1:57:45.040
 that there shouldn't be fires.

1:57:45.040 --> 1:57:49.520
 I feel like if I could just play my game impeccably,

1:57:49.520 --> 1:57:53.640
 the people who actually care what I think will follow me

1:57:53.640 --> 1:57:58.640
 when I hit Trump and hit free will and hit the woke

1:57:58.640 --> 1:58:00.400
 and hit whatever it is,

1:58:00.400 --> 1:58:03.080
 how we should respond to the coronavirus, you know?

1:58:03.080 --> 1:58:06.200
 I mean, vaccines, are they a thing, right?

1:58:06.200 --> 1:58:10.640
 Like there's such derangement in our information space now

1:58:10.640 --> 1:58:13.040
 that, I mean, I guess, you know,

1:58:13.040 --> 1:58:15.160
 some people could be getting more of this than I expect,

1:58:15.160 --> 1:58:18.560
 but I just noticed that many of our friends

1:58:18.560 --> 1:58:22.560
 who are in the same game have more homogenized audiences

1:58:22.560 --> 1:58:26.520
 and don't get, I mean, they've successfully filtered out

1:58:26.520 --> 1:58:30.600
 the people who are gonna despise them on this next topic.

1:58:30.600 --> 1:58:34.600
 And I would imagine you have a different experience

1:58:34.600 --> 1:58:36.560
 of having a podcast than I do at this point.

1:58:36.560 --> 1:58:38.800
 I mean, I'm sure you get haters,

1:58:38.800 --> 1:58:43.560
 but I would imagine you're more streamlined.

1:58:43.560 --> 1:58:45.360
 I actually don't like the word haters

1:58:45.360 --> 1:58:50.360
 because it kinda presumes that it puts people in a bin.

1:58:50.840 --> 1:58:54.200
 I think we're all have like baby haters inside of us

1:58:54.200 --> 1:58:57.400
 and we just apply them and some people enjoy doing that

1:58:57.400 --> 1:59:00.280
 more than others for particular periods of time.

1:59:00.280 --> 1:59:03.200
 I think you're gonna almost see hating on the internet

1:59:03.200 --> 1:59:05.720
 as a video game that you just play and it's fun,

1:59:05.720 --> 1:59:07.400
 but then you can put it down and walk away

1:59:07.400 --> 1:59:10.080
 and no, I certainly have a bunch of people

1:59:10.080 --> 1:59:11.240
 that are very critical.

1:59:11.240 --> 1:59:12.600
 I can list all the ways.

1:59:12.600 --> 1:59:14.760
 But does it feel like on any given topic,

1:59:14.760 --> 1:59:17.760
 does it feel like it's an actual title surge

1:59:17.760 --> 1:59:19.880
 where it's like 30% of your audience

1:59:19.880 --> 1:59:22.800
 and then the other 30% of your audience

1:59:22.800 --> 1:59:24.040
 from podcast to podcast?

1:59:24.040 --> 1:59:24.880
 No, no, no.

1:59:24.880 --> 1:59:27.560
 That's happening to me all the time now.

1:59:27.560 --> 1:59:30.240
 Well, I'm more with, I don't know what you think about this.

1:59:30.240 --> 1:59:33.480
 I mean, Joe Rogan doesn't read comments

1:59:33.480 --> 1:59:35.160
 or doesn't read comments much.

1:59:35.160 --> 1:59:38.240
 And the argument he made to me is that

1:59:40.240 --> 1:59:45.240
 he already has like a self critical person inside.

1:59:46.600 --> 1:59:48.360
 And I'm gonna have to think about

1:59:48.360 --> 1:59:49.520
 what you said in this conversation,

1:59:49.520 --> 1:59:52.840
 but I have this very harshly self critical person

1:59:52.840 --> 1:59:55.920
 inside as well where I don't need more fuel.

1:59:55.920 --> 1:59:59.480
 I don't need, no, I do sometimes.

1:59:59.480 --> 2:00:02.200
 That's why I check negativity occasionally,

2:00:02.200 --> 2:00:03.720
 not too often.

2:00:03.720 --> 2:00:06.160
 I sometimes need to like put a little bit more

2:00:06.160 --> 2:00:09.760
 like coals into the fire, but not too much.

2:00:09.760 --> 2:00:11.800
 But I already have that self critical engine

2:00:11.800 --> 2:00:12.960
 that keeps me in check.

2:00:12.960 --> 2:00:15.880
 I just, I wonder, you know, a lot of people

2:00:15.880 --> 2:00:20.880
 who gain more and more fame lose that ability

2:00:20.880 --> 2:00:21.880
 to be self critical.

2:00:21.880 --> 2:00:23.760
 I guess because they lose the audience

2:00:23.760 --> 2:00:25.360
 that can be critical towards them.

2:00:25.360 --> 2:00:26.200
 Hmm.

2:00:26.200 --> 2:00:28.960
 You know, I do follow Joe's advice much more

2:00:28.960 --> 2:00:29.800
 than I ever have here.

2:00:29.800 --> 2:00:32.120
 Like I don't look at comments very often.

2:00:32.120 --> 2:00:36.600
 And I'm probably using Twitter, you know,

2:00:36.600 --> 2:00:39.600
 5% as much as I used to.

2:00:39.600 --> 2:00:42.040
 I mean, I really just get in and out on Twitter

2:00:42.040 --> 2:00:44.880
 and spend very little time in my ad mentions.

2:00:46.880 --> 2:00:49.280
 I bet, you know, it does, in some ways it feels like a loss

2:00:49.280 --> 2:00:50.320
 because occasionally I get,

2:00:50.320 --> 2:00:52.960
 I see something super intelligent there.

2:00:52.960 --> 2:00:55.360
 Like, I mean, I'll check my Twitter ad mentions

2:00:55.360 --> 2:00:58.040
 and someone will have said, oh, have you read this article?

2:00:58.040 --> 2:01:00.120
 And it's like, man, that was just,

2:01:00.120 --> 2:01:03.080
 that was like the best article sent to me in a month, right?

2:01:03.080 --> 2:01:04.720
 So it's like to have not have looked

2:01:04.720 --> 2:01:08.040
 and to not have seen that, that's a loss.

2:01:08.040 --> 2:01:13.040
 So, but it does, at this point, a little goes a long way.

2:01:13.040 --> 2:01:18.040
 Cause I, yeah, it's not that it, for me now,

2:01:19.040 --> 2:01:23.080
 I mean, this could sound like a fairly Stalinistic immunity

2:01:23.080 --> 2:01:27.280
 to criticism, it's not so much that these voices of hate

2:01:27.280 --> 2:01:31.280
 turn on my inner hater, you know, more,

2:01:31.280 --> 2:01:33.400
 it's more that I just, I get a,

2:01:33.400 --> 2:01:38.400
 what I fear is a false sense of humanity.

2:01:38.520 --> 2:01:41.120
 Like, I feel like I'm too online

2:01:41.120 --> 2:01:43.960
 and online is selecting for this performative outrage

2:01:43.960 --> 2:01:46.520
 in everybody, everyone's signaling to an audience

2:01:46.520 --> 2:01:48.400
 when they trash you.

2:01:48.400 --> 2:01:52.400
 And I get a dark, I'm getting a, you know,

2:01:52.400 --> 2:01:57.400
 a misanthropic, you know, cut of just what it's like

2:01:58.680 --> 2:01:59.520
 out there.

2:01:59.520 --> 2:02:02.120
 And it, cause when you meet people in real life,

2:02:02.120 --> 2:02:04.640
 they're great, you know, they're all rather often great,

2:02:04.640 --> 2:02:09.040
 you know, and it takes a lot to have anything

2:02:09.040 --> 2:02:13.040
 like a Twitter encounter in real life with a living person.

2:02:15.040 --> 2:02:19.040
 And that's, I think it's much better to have that

2:02:19.040 --> 2:02:24.040
 as one's default sense of what it's like to be with people

2:02:24.840 --> 2:02:28.040
 than what one gets on social media

2:02:28.040 --> 2:02:30.440
 or on YouTube comment threads.

2:02:30.440 --> 2:02:33.440
 You've produced a special episode with Rob Reed

2:02:33.440 --> 2:02:38.160
 on your podcast recently on how bioengineering of viruses

2:02:38.160 --> 2:02:40.400
 is going to destroy human civilization.

2:02:40.400 --> 2:02:41.680
 So.

2:02:41.680 --> 2:02:42.520
 Or could.

2:02:42.520 --> 2:02:43.360
 Could.

2:02:43.360 --> 2:02:44.200
 One fears, yeah.

2:02:44.200 --> 2:02:45.280
 Sorry, the confidence there.

2:02:45.280 --> 2:02:49.480
 But in the 21st century, what do you think,

2:02:49.480 --> 2:02:53.640
 especially after having thought through that angle,

2:02:53.640 --> 2:02:56.040
 what do you think is the biggest threat

2:02:56.040 --> 2:02:58.720
 to the survival of the human species?

2:03:00.880 --> 2:03:02.760
 I can give you the full menu if you'd like.

2:03:02.760 --> 2:03:06.680
 Yeah, well, no, I would put the biggest threat

2:03:06.680 --> 2:03:11.680
 at another level out, kind of the meta threat

2:03:11.680 --> 2:03:16.680
 is our inability to agree about what the threats actually are

2:03:19.040 --> 2:03:24.040
 and to converge on strategies for responding to them, right?

2:03:25.120 --> 2:03:28.520
 So like I view COVID as, among other things,

2:03:29.760 --> 2:03:34.760
 a truly terrifyingly failed dress rehearsal

2:03:35.680 --> 2:03:37.160
 for something far worse, right?

2:03:37.160 --> 2:03:41.520
 I mean, COVID is just about as benign as it could have been

2:03:41.520 --> 2:03:44.600
 and still have been worse than the flu

2:03:44.600 --> 2:03:46.560
 when you're talking about a global pandemic, right?

2:03:46.560 --> 2:03:51.560
 So it's just, it's gonna kill a few million people

2:03:51.600 --> 2:03:53.440
 or it looks like it's killed about 3 million people.

2:03:53.440 --> 2:03:56.280
 Maybe it'll kill a few million more

2:03:56.280 --> 2:03:58.160
 unless something gets away from us

2:03:58.160 --> 2:04:00.920
 with a variant that's much worse

2:04:00.920 --> 2:04:02.480
 or we really don't play our cards right.

2:04:02.480 --> 2:04:06.320
 But I mean, the general shape of it is

2:04:06.320 --> 2:04:11.320
 it's got somewhere around, well, 1% lethality

2:04:12.920 --> 2:04:17.920
 and whatever side of that number it really is on

2:04:18.280 --> 2:04:23.280
 in the end, it's not what would in fact be possible

2:04:23.720 --> 2:04:26.520
 and is in fact probably inevitable

2:04:26.520 --> 2:04:29.600
 something with orders of magnitude,

2:04:29.600 --> 2:04:30.800
 more lethality than that.

2:04:30.800 --> 2:04:35.360
 And it's just so obvious we are totally unprepared, right?

2:04:35.360 --> 2:04:39.800
 We are running this epidemiological experiment

2:04:39.800 --> 2:04:41.640
 of linking the entire world together

2:04:41.640 --> 2:04:46.320
 and then also now per the podcast that Rob Reed did

2:04:47.720 --> 2:04:51.000
 democratizing the tech that will allow us to do this

2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:53.200
 to engineer pandemics, right?

2:04:53.200 --> 2:04:56.920
 And more and more people will be able

2:04:56.920 --> 2:05:00.800
 to engineer synthetic viruses that will be

2:05:02.800 --> 2:05:04.920
 by the sheer fact that they would have been engineered

2:05:04.920 --> 2:05:08.600
 with malicious intent, worse than COVID.

2:05:08.600 --> 2:05:11.600
 And we're still living in,

2:05:11.600 --> 2:05:13.880
 to speak specifically about the United States,

2:05:13.880 --> 2:05:17.920
 we have a country here where we can't even agree

2:05:17.920 --> 2:05:20.320
 that this is a thing, like that COVID,

2:05:20.320 --> 2:05:21.440
 I mean, there's still people who think

2:05:21.440 --> 2:05:25.560
 that this is basically a hoax designed to control people.

2:05:25.560 --> 2:05:30.560
 And stranger still, there are people who will acknowledge

2:05:30.560 --> 2:05:34.640
 that COVID is real and they'll look,

2:05:34.640 --> 2:05:38.520
 they don't think the deaths have been faked or misascribed,

2:05:42.640 --> 2:05:47.440
 but they think that they're far happier

2:05:47.440 --> 2:05:49.440
 at the prospect of catching COVID

2:05:49.440 --> 2:05:53.520
 than they are of getting vaccinated for COVID, right?

2:05:53.520 --> 2:05:54.520
 They're not worried about COVID,

2:05:54.520 --> 2:05:57.000
 they're worried about vaccines for COVID, right?

2:05:57.000 --> 2:06:01.000
 And the fact that we just can't converge in a conversation

2:06:01.000 --> 2:06:05.960
 that we've now had a year to have with one another

2:06:05.960 --> 2:06:08.160
 on just what is the ground truth here?

2:06:08.160 --> 2:06:09.800
 What's happened?

2:06:09.800 --> 2:06:11.000
 Why has it happened?

2:06:12.760 --> 2:06:17.760
 How safe is it to get COVID in every cohort

2:06:17.760 --> 2:06:19.240
 in the population?

2:06:19.240 --> 2:06:21.040
 And how safe are the vaccines?

2:06:21.040 --> 2:06:23.920
 And the fact that there's still an air of mystery

2:06:23.920 --> 2:06:27.280
 around all of this for much of our society

2:06:28.240 --> 2:06:30.680
 does not bode well when you're talking about solving

2:06:30.680 --> 2:06:32.840
 any other problem that may yet kill us.

2:06:32.840 --> 2:06:34.400
 But do you think convergence grows

2:06:34.400 --> 2:06:36.560
 with the magnitude of the threat?

2:06:36.560 --> 2:06:40.800
 It's possible, except I feel like we have tipped into,

2:06:40.800 --> 2:06:45.800
 because when the threat of COVID looked the most dire,

2:06:45.920 --> 2:06:48.880
 when we were seeing reports from Italy

2:06:48.880 --> 2:06:51.600
 that looked like the beginning of a zombie movie.

2:06:51.600 --> 2:06:52.760
 Because it could have been much, much worse.

2:06:52.760 --> 2:06:55.480
 Yeah, this is lethal, right?

2:06:55.480 --> 2:06:57.920
 Your ICUs are gonna fill up in,

2:06:57.920 --> 2:06:59.680
 you're 14 days behind us.

2:07:01.320 --> 2:07:04.760
 Your medical system is in danger of collapse.

2:07:04.760 --> 2:07:06.640
 Lock the fuck down.

2:07:06.640 --> 2:07:11.640
 We have people refusing to do anything sane

2:07:11.680 --> 2:07:12.920
 in the face of that.

2:07:12.920 --> 2:07:14.880
 People fundamentally thinking,

2:07:14.880 --> 2:07:17.320
 it's not gonna get here, right?

2:07:17.320 --> 2:07:18.480
 Who knows what's going on in Italy,

2:07:18.480 --> 2:07:21.480
 but it has no implications for what's gonna go on in New York

2:07:21.480 --> 2:07:23.360
 in a mere six days, right?

2:07:23.360 --> 2:07:25.320
 And now it kicks off in New York,

2:07:25.320 --> 2:07:27.720
 and you've got people in the middle of the country

2:07:27.720 --> 2:07:31.720
 thinking it's no factor, it's not,

2:07:31.720 --> 2:07:34.240
 that's just big city, those are big city problems,

2:07:34.240 --> 2:07:35.520
 or they're faking it.

2:07:35.520 --> 2:07:40.080
 Or, I mean, it just, the layer of politics

2:07:40.080 --> 2:07:42.600
 has become so dysfunctional for us

2:07:42.600 --> 2:07:47.600
 that even in the presence of a pandemic

2:07:48.320 --> 2:07:50.920
 that looked legitimately scary there in the beginning,

2:07:50.920 --> 2:07:52.880
 I mean, it's not to say that it hasn't been devastating

2:07:52.880 --> 2:07:54.920
 for everyone who's been directly affected by it,

2:07:54.920 --> 2:07:56.800
 and it's not to say it can't get worse,

2:07:56.800 --> 2:07:58.920
 but here, for a very long time,

2:07:58.920 --> 2:08:01.960
 we have known that we were in a situation

2:08:01.960 --> 2:08:05.840
 that is more benign than what seemed

2:08:05.840 --> 2:08:08.760
 like the worst case scenario as it was kicking off,

2:08:08.760 --> 2:08:09.840
 especially in Italy.

2:08:11.640 --> 2:08:15.560
 And so still, yeah, it's quite possible

2:08:15.560 --> 2:08:18.720
 that if we saw the asteroid hurtling toward Earth

2:08:18.720 --> 2:08:23.040
 and everyone agreed that it's gonna make impact

2:08:23.040 --> 2:08:25.040
 and we're all gonna die,

2:08:25.040 --> 2:08:27.680
 then we could get off Twitter

2:08:27.680 --> 2:08:30.200
 and actually build the rockets

2:08:30.200 --> 2:08:32.960
 that are gonna divert the asteroid

2:08:32.960 --> 2:08:35.080
 from its Earth crossing path,

2:08:35.080 --> 2:08:37.720
 and we could do something pretty heroic.

2:08:37.720 --> 2:08:41.520
 But when you talk about anything else

2:08:41.520 --> 2:08:46.520
 that isn't, that's slower moving than that,

2:08:46.960 --> 2:08:48.560
 I mean, something like climate change,

2:08:48.560 --> 2:08:53.560
 I think the prospect of our converging

2:08:54.440 --> 2:08:56.000
 on a solution to climate change

2:08:56.000 --> 2:08:58.880
 purely based on political persuasion

2:08:58.880 --> 2:09:00.520
 is nonexistent at this point.

2:09:00.520 --> 2:09:04.400
 I just think, to bring Elon back into this,

2:09:04.400 --> 2:09:05.960
 the way to deal with climate change

2:09:05.960 --> 2:09:09.680
 is to create technology that everyone wants

2:09:09.680 --> 2:09:14.520
 that is better than all the carbon producing technology,

2:09:14.520 --> 2:09:15.640
 and then we just transition

2:09:15.640 --> 2:09:19.240
 because you want an electric car

2:09:19.240 --> 2:09:20.640
 the same way you wanted a smartphone

2:09:20.640 --> 2:09:22.720
 or you want anything else,

2:09:22.720 --> 2:09:24.840
 and you're working totally with the grain

2:09:24.840 --> 2:09:29.040
 of people's selfishness and short term thinking.

2:09:29.040 --> 2:09:31.080
 The idea that we're gonna convince

2:09:31.080 --> 2:09:33.160
 the better part of humanity

2:09:33.160 --> 2:09:35.440
 that climate change is an emergency,

2:09:35.440 --> 2:09:39.000
 that they have to make sacrifices to respond to,

2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:41.120
 given what's happened around COVID,

2:09:41.120 --> 2:09:46.120
 I just think that's the fantasy of a fantasy.

2:09:46.280 --> 2:09:48.160
 But speaking of Elon,

2:09:48.160 --> 2:09:49.680
 I have a bunch of positive things

2:09:49.680 --> 2:09:51.680
 that I wanna say here in response to you,

2:09:51.680 --> 2:09:53.640
 but you're opening so many threads,

2:09:53.640 --> 2:09:57.720
 but let me pull one of them, which is AI.

2:09:57.720 --> 2:10:02.440
 Both you and Elon think that with AI,

2:10:02.440 --> 2:10:05.520
 you're summoning demons, summoning a demon,

2:10:05.520 --> 2:10:07.480
 maybe not in those poetic terms, but.

2:10:08.480 --> 2:10:10.760
 Well, potentially. Potentially.

2:10:10.760 --> 2:10:15.760
 Two very, three very parsimonious assumptions,

2:10:17.200 --> 2:10:18.600
 I think, here.

2:10:18.600 --> 2:10:21.360
 Scientifically, parsimonious assumptions get me there.

2:10:25.160 --> 2:10:26.200
 Any of which could be wrong,

2:10:26.200 --> 2:10:28.600
 but it just seems like the weight

2:10:28.600 --> 2:10:31.440
 of the evidence is on their side.

2:10:31.440 --> 2:10:34.040
 One is that it comes back to this topic

2:10:34.040 --> 2:10:36.960
 of substrate independence, right?

2:10:36.960 --> 2:10:38.160
 Anyone who's in the business

2:10:38.160 --> 2:10:40.480
 of producing intelligent machines

2:10:40.480 --> 2:10:43.880
 must believe, ultimately,

2:10:43.880 --> 2:10:45.720
 that there's nothing magical

2:10:45.720 --> 2:10:47.360
 about having a computer made of meat.

2:10:47.360 --> 2:10:50.800
 You can do this in the kinds of materials

2:10:50.800 --> 2:10:53.480
 we're using now,

2:10:53.480 --> 2:10:56.800
 and there's no special something

2:10:56.800 --> 2:11:00.960
 that presents a real impediment

2:11:00.960 --> 2:11:04.800
 to producing human level intelligence in silico, right?

2:11:05.880 --> 2:11:08.320
 Again, an assumption, I'm sure there are a few people

2:11:08.320 --> 2:11:09.800
 who still think there is something magical

2:11:09.800 --> 2:11:12.840
 about biological systems,

2:11:12.840 --> 2:11:15.080
 but leave that aside.

2:11:18.720 --> 2:11:20.520
 Given that assumption,

2:11:20.520 --> 2:11:21.440
 and given the assumption

2:11:21.440 --> 2:11:24.640
 that we just continue making incremental progress,

2:11:24.640 --> 2:11:25.800
 doesn't have to be Moore's Law,

2:11:25.800 --> 2:11:27.040
 it just has to be progress,

2:11:27.040 --> 2:11:29.040
 that just doesn't stop,

2:11:29.040 --> 2:11:30.440
 at a certain point,

2:11:30.440 --> 2:11:34.600
 we'll get to human level intelligence and beyond.

2:11:34.600 --> 2:11:36.400
 And human level intelligence,

2:11:36.400 --> 2:11:38.560
 I think, is also clearly a mirage,

2:11:38.560 --> 2:11:40.520
 because anything that's human level

2:11:40.520 --> 2:11:42.480
 is gonna be superhuman

2:11:42.480 --> 2:11:44.840
 by unless we decide to dumb it down, right?

2:11:44.840 --> 2:11:47.480
 I mean, my phone is already superhuman as a calculator,

2:11:47.480 --> 2:11:51.240
 right, so why would we make the human level AI

2:11:51.240 --> 2:11:54.880
 just as good as me as a calculator?

2:11:54.880 --> 2:11:57.280
 So I think we'll very,

2:11:57.280 --> 2:11:59.440
 if we continue to make progress,

2:11:59.440 --> 2:12:03.800
 we will be in the presence of superhuman competence

2:12:03.800 --> 2:12:08.800
 for any act of intelligence or cognition

2:12:09.040 --> 2:12:11.120
 that we care to prioritize.

2:12:11.120 --> 2:12:13.440
 It's not to say that we'll create everything

2:12:13.440 --> 2:12:14.280
 that a human could do,

2:12:14.280 --> 2:12:16.440
 maybe we'll leave certain things out,

2:12:16.440 --> 2:12:18.600
 but anything that we care about,

2:12:18.600 --> 2:12:20.520
 and we care about a lot,

2:12:20.520 --> 2:12:21.920
 and we certainly care about anything

2:12:21.920 --> 2:12:24.560
 that produces a lot of power,

2:12:24.560 --> 2:12:26.920
 that we care about scientific insights

2:12:26.920 --> 2:12:30.680
 and an ability to produce new technology and all of that,

2:12:30.680 --> 2:12:34.320
 we'll have something that's superhuman.

2:12:34.320 --> 2:12:38.000
 And then the final assumption is just that

2:12:39.320 --> 2:12:42.680
 there have to be ways to do that

2:12:42.680 --> 2:12:46.520
 that are not aligned with a happy coexistence

2:12:46.520 --> 2:12:51.360
 with these now more powerful entities than ourselves.

2:12:51.360 --> 2:12:54.200
 So, and I would guess,

2:12:54.200 --> 2:12:57.160
 and this is kind of a rider to that assumption,

2:12:57.160 --> 2:12:59.680
 there are probably more ways to do it badly

2:12:59.680 --> 2:13:01.600
 than to do it perfectly.

2:13:01.600 --> 2:13:05.760
 That is perfectly aligned with our wellbeing.

2:13:05.760 --> 2:13:10.760
 And when you think about the consequences of nonalignment,

2:13:10.960 --> 2:13:11.960
 when you think about,

2:13:13.800 --> 2:13:15.560
 you're now in the presence of something

2:13:15.560 --> 2:13:18.480
 that is more intelligent than you are, right?

2:13:18.480 --> 2:13:20.200
 Which is to say more competent, right?

2:13:20.200 --> 2:13:24.840
 Unless you've, and obviously there are cartoon pictures

2:13:24.840 --> 2:13:26.280
 of this where we could just,

2:13:26.280 --> 2:13:27.320
 this is just an off switch,

2:13:27.320 --> 2:13:28.480
 we could just turn off the off switch,

2:13:28.480 --> 2:13:31.640
 or they're tethered to something that makes them,

2:13:31.640 --> 2:13:33.720
 our slaves in perpetuity,

2:13:33.720 --> 2:13:34.880
 even though they're more intelligent.

2:13:34.880 --> 2:13:39.720
 But those scenarios strike me as a failure to imagine

2:13:39.720 --> 2:13:42.320
 what is actually entailed by greater intelligence, right?

2:13:42.320 --> 2:13:43.480
 So if you imagine something

2:13:43.480 --> 2:13:46.520
 that's legitimately more intelligent than you are,

2:13:47.800 --> 2:13:51.320
 and you're now in relationship to it, right?

2:13:51.320 --> 2:13:52.640
 You're in the presence of this thing

2:13:52.640 --> 2:13:54.800
 and it is autonomous in all kinds of ways

2:13:54.800 --> 2:13:57.080
 because it had to be to be more intelligent than you are.

2:13:57.080 --> 2:14:00.400
 I mean, you built it to be all of those things.

2:14:01.800 --> 2:14:05.640
 We just can't find ourselves in a negotiation

2:14:05.640 --> 2:14:08.000
 with something more intelligent than we are, you know?

2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:10.480
 And we can't, so we have to have found

2:14:10.480 --> 2:14:15.160
 the subset of ways to build these machines

2:14:16.080 --> 2:14:21.080
 that are perpetually amenable to our saying,

2:14:22.560 --> 2:14:25.000
 oh, that's not what we meant, that's not what we intended.

2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:27.160
 Could you stop doing that, just come back over here

2:14:27.160 --> 2:14:29.400
 and do this thing that we actually want.

2:14:29.400 --> 2:14:31.600
 And for them to care, for them to be tethered

2:14:31.600 --> 2:14:33.880
 to our own sense of our own wellbeing,

2:14:35.560 --> 2:14:39.080
 such that, you know, I mean, their utility function is,

2:14:39.080 --> 2:14:41.560
 you know, their primary utility function is for,

2:14:41.560 --> 2:14:43.240
 is to have, you know, this is, I think,

2:14:43.240 --> 2:14:48.240
 Stuart Russell's cartoon plan is to figure out

2:14:51.560 --> 2:14:53.920
 how to tether them to a utility function

2:14:53.920 --> 2:14:58.920
 that has our own estimation of what's going to improve

2:14:59.600 --> 2:15:04.600
 our wellbeing as its master, you know, reward, right?

2:15:05.520 --> 2:15:07.680
 So it's like, all that, this thing can get

2:15:07.680 --> 2:15:10.040
 as intelligent as it can get,

2:15:10.040 --> 2:15:13.000
 but it only ever really wants to figure out

2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:16.040
 how to make our lives better by our own view of better.

2:15:16.040 --> 2:15:19.240
 Now, not to say there wouldn't be a conversation about,

2:15:19.240 --> 2:15:21.040
 you know, I mean, because there's all kinds of things

2:15:21.040 --> 2:15:24.720
 we're not seeing clearly about what is better,

2:15:24.720 --> 2:15:27.600
 and if we were in the presence of a genie or an oracle

2:15:27.600 --> 2:15:29.200
 that could really tell us what is better,

2:15:29.200 --> 2:15:32.080
 well, then we presumably would want to hear that,

2:15:32.080 --> 2:15:37.080
 and we would modify our sense of what to do next

2:15:37.800 --> 2:15:41.000
 in conversation with these minds.

2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:45.240
 But I just feel like it is a failure of imagination

2:15:45.240 --> 2:15:50.240
 to think that being in relationship to something

2:15:55.160 --> 2:15:59.560
 more intelligent than yourself isn't in most cases

2:16:00.600 --> 2:16:05.800
 a circumstance of real peril, because it is.

2:16:05.800 --> 2:16:09.440
 Just to think of how everything on Earth has to,

2:16:09.440 --> 2:16:12.120
 if they could think about their relationship to us,

2:16:12.120 --> 2:16:16.520
 if birds could think about what we're doing, right?

2:16:16.520 --> 2:16:21.400
 They would, I mean, the bottom line is

2:16:21.400 --> 2:16:26.040
 they're always in danger of our discovering

2:16:26.040 --> 2:16:29.440
 that there's something we care about more than birds, right?

2:16:29.440 --> 2:16:30.920
 Or there's something we want

2:16:30.920 --> 2:16:34.240
 that disregards the wellbeing of birds.

2:16:34.240 --> 2:16:37.720
 And obviously much of our behavior is inscrutable to them.

2:16:37.720 --> 2:16:39.080
 Occasionally we pay attention to them,

2:16:39.080 --> 2:16:41.640
 and occasionally we withdraw our attention,

2:16:41.640 --> 2:16:43.080
 and occasionally we just kill them all

2:16:43.080 --> 2:16:45.480
 for reasons they can't possibly understand.

2:16:45.480 --> 2:16:48.320
 But if we're building something more intelligent

2:16:48.320 --> 2:16:49.840
 than ourselves, by definition,

2:16:49.840 --> 2:16:52.920
 we're building something whose horizons

2:16:52.920 --> 2:16:57.920
 of value and cognition can exceed our own

2:17:00.040 --> 2:17:05.040
 and in ways where we can't necessarily foresee,

2:17:05.240 --> 2:17:09.280
 again, perpetually, that they don't just wake up one day

2:17:09.280 --> 2:17:14.200
 and decide, okay, well, these humans need to disappear.

2:17:14.200 --> 2:17:19.200
 So I think I agree with most of the initial things you said.

2:17:19.720 --> 2:17:22.520
 What I don't necessarily agree with,

2:17:22.520 --> 2:17:24.040
 and of course nobody knows,

2:17:24.040 --> 2:17:27.520
 but that the more likely set of trajectories

2:17:27.520 --> 2:17:30.360
 that we're going to take are going to be positive.

2:17:30.360 --> 2:17:32.600
 That's what I believe in the sense

2:17:32.600 --> 2:17:35.840
 that the way you develop,

2:17:35.840 --> 2:17:40.280
 I believe the way you develop successful AI systems

2:17:40.280 --> 2:17:43.720
 will be deeply integrated with human society.

2:17:43.720 --> 2:17:45.360
 And for them to succeed,

2:17:45.360 --> 2:17:48.040
 they're going to have to be aligned

2:17:48.040 --> 2:17:50.320
 in the way we humans are aligned with each other,

2:17:50.320 --> 2:17:52.560
 which doesn't mean we're aligned.

2:17:52.560 --> 2:17:54.720
 There's no such thing,

2:17:54.720 --> 2:17:57.880
 or I don't see there's such thing as a perfect alignment,

2:17:57.880 --> 2:18:01.080
 but they're going to be participating in the dance,

2:18:01.080 --> 2:18:04.560
 in the game theoretic dance of human society,

2:18:04.560 --> 2:18:06.520
 as they become more and more intelligent.

2:18:06.520 --> 2:18:09.240
 There could be a point beyond which

2:18:09.240 --> 2:18:11.520
 we are like birds to them.

2:18:12.480 --> 2:18:16.080
 But what about an intelligence explosion of some kind?

2:18:16.080 --> 2:18:21.080
 So I believe the explosion will be happening,

2:18:21.080 --> 2:18:24.120
 but there's a lot of explosion to be done

2:18:24.120 --> 2:18:26.200
 before we become like birds.

2:18:26.200 --> 2:18:28.120
 I truly believe that human beings

2:18:28.120 --> 2:18:30.680
 are very intelligent in ways we don't understand.

2:18:30.680 --> 2:18:32.280
 It's not just about chess.

2:18:32.280 --> 2:18:35.360
 It's about all the intricate computation

2:18:35.360 --> 2:18:37.640
 we're able to perform, common sense,

2:18:37.640 --> 2:18:40.600
 our ability to reason about this world, consciousness.

2:18:40.600 --> 2:18:42.400
 I think we're doing a lot of work

2:18:42.400 --> 2:18:44.560
 we don't realize is necessary to be done

2:18:44.560 --> 2:18:47.720
 in order to truly become,

2:18:47.720 --> 2:18:49.960
 like truly achieve super intelligence.

2:18:49.960 --> 2:18:52.120
 And I just think there'll be a period of time

2:18:52.120 --> 2:18:53.720
 that's not overnight.

2:18:53.720 --> 2:18:57.120
 The overnight nature of it will not literally be overnight.

2:18:57.120 --> 2:18:59.520
 It'll be over a period of decades.

2:18:59.520 --> 2:19:00.360
 So my sense is...

2:19:00.360 --> 2:19:02.960
 So why would it be that, but just take,

2:19:02.960 --> 2:19:06.400
 draw an analogy from recent successes,

2:19:06.400 --> 2:19:09.400
 like something like AlphaGo or AlphaZero.

2:19:09.400 --> 2:19:11.720
 I forget the actual metric,

2:19:11.720 --> 2:19:14.800
 but it was something like this algorithm,

2:19:15.680 --> 2:19:17.280
 which wasn't even totally,

2:19:17.280 --> 2:19:19.400
 it wasn't bespoke for chess playing,

2:19:21.440 --> 2:19:24.120
 in the matter of, I think it was four hours,

2:19:24.120 --> 2:19:27.200
 played itself so many times and so successfully

2:19:27.200 --> 2:19:30.960
 that it became the best chess playing computer.

2:19:30.960 --> 2:19:33.680
 It was not only better than every human being,

2:19:33.680 --> 2:19:36.760
 it was better than every previous chess program

2:19:36.760 --> 2:19:38.600
 in a matter of a day, right?

2:19:38.600 --> 2:19:41.000
 So just imagine, again,

2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:43.720
 we don't have to recapitulate everything about us,

2:19:43.720 --> 2:19:45.640
 but just imagine building a system,

2:19:47.960 --> 2:19:50.440
 and who knows when we'll be able to do this,

2:19:50.440 --> 2:19:52.000
 but at some point we'll be able,

2:19:52.000 --> 2:19:56.080
 at some point the 100 or 100 favorite things

2:19:56.080 --> 2:20:01.080
 about human cognition will be analogous to chess

2:20:01.240 --> 2:20:03.920
 in that we will be able to build machines

2:20:03.920 --> 2:20:07.960
 that very quickly outperform any human,

2:20:07.960 --> 2:20:12.120
 and then very quickly outperform the last algorithm

2:20:12.120 --> 2:20:13.520
 that outperform the humans.

2:20:13.520 --> 2:20:17.400
 Like something like the AlphaGo experience

2:20:17.400 --> 2:20:21.520
 seems possible for facial recognition

2:20:21.520 --> 2:20:23.720
 and detecting human emotion

2:20:23.720 --> 2:20:26.280
 and natural language processing, right?

2:20:26.280 --> 2:20:29.640
 Well, it's just that everyone,

2:20:29.640 --> 2:20:33.080
 even math people, math heads,

2:20:33.080 --> 2:20:36.480
 tend to have bad intuitions for exponentiation, right?

2:20:36.480 --> 2:20:37.640
 I mean, we noticed this during COVID.

2:20:37.640 --> 2:20:39.200
 I mean, you have some very smart people

2:20:39.200 --> 2:20:42.600
 who still couldn't get their minds around the fact

2:20:42.600 --> 2:20:46.760
 that an exponential is really surprising.

2:20:46.760 --> 2:20:49.440
 I mean, things double and double and double and double again,

2:20:49.440 --> 2:20:51.200
 and you don't notice much of anything changes,

2:20:51.200 --> 2:20:56.200
 and then the last two stages of doubling swamp everything.

2:20:56.280 --> 2:20:59.640
 And it just seems like that,

2:20:59.640 --> 2:21:04.640
 to assume that there isn't a deep analogy

2:21:04.680 --> 2:21:09.680
 between what we're seeing for the more tractable problems,

2:21:09.800 --> 2:21:13.160
 like chess, to other modes of cognition,

2:21:13.160 --> 2:21:16.080
 it's like once you crack that problem,

2:21:16.080 --> 2:21:17.960
 it seems, because for the longest time,

2:21:17.960 --> 2:21:20.840
 it was impossible to think

2:21:20.840 --> 2:21:25.080
 we were gonna make headway in AI, you know, it's like.

2:21:25.080 --> 2:21:27.560
 Chess and Go was seen as impossible.

2:21:27.560 --> 2:21:29.200
 Yeah, Go seemed unattainable.

2:21:29.200 --> 2:21:33.360
 Even when chess had been cracked, Go seemed unattainable.

2:21:33.360 --> 2:21:37.000
 Yeah, and actually still Russell was behind the people

2:21:37.000 --> 2:21:38.960
 that were saying it's unattainable,

2:21:38.960 --> 2:21:42.840
 because it seemed like it's intractable problem.

2:21:42.840 --> 2:21:44.440
 But there's something different

2:21:44.440 --> 2:21:46.560
 about the space of cognition

2:21:46.560 --> 2:21:49.640
 that's detached from human society, which is what chess is,

2:21:49.640 --> 2:21:51.240
 meaning like just thinking,

2:21:52.120 --> 2:21:54.280
 having actual exponential impact

2:21:54.280 --> 2:21:56.560
 on the physical world is different.

2:21:56.560 --> 2:21:58.280
 I tend to believe that there's,

2:22:00.040 --> 2:22:03.680
 for AI to get to the point where it's super intelligent,

2:22:03.680 --> 2:22:07.680
 it's going to have to go through the funnel of society.

2:22:07.680 --> 2:22:09.560
 And for that, it has to be deeply integrated

2:22:09.560 --> 2:22:12.880
 with human beings, and for that, it has to be aligned.

2:22:12.880 --> 2:22:15.560
 But you're talking about like actually hooking us up

2:22:15.560 --> 2:22:16.800
 to like the neural link, you know,

2:22:16.800 --> 2:22:21.800
 we're gonna be the brainstem to the robot overlords?

2:22:22.200 --> 2:22:23.360
 That's a possibility as well.

2:22:23.360 --> 2:22:25.120
 But what I mean is,

2:22:25.120 --> 2:22:28.840
 in order to develop autonomous weapon systems, for example,

2:22:28.840 --> 2:22:31.280
 which are highly concerning to me

2:22:31.280 --> 2:22:34.760
 that both US and China are participating in now,

2:22:34.760 --> 2:22:38.320
 that in order to develop them and for them to become,

2:22:38.320 --> 2:22:40.160
 to have more and more responsibility

2:22:40.160 --> 2:22:44.520
 to actually do military strategic actions,

2:22:44.520 --> 2:22:47.960
 they're going to have to be integrated

2:22:47.960 --> 2:22:51.760
 into human beings doing the strategic action.

2:22:51.760 --> 2:22:54.160
 They're going to have to work alongside with each other.

2:22:54.160 --> 2:22:56.480
 And the way those systems will be developed

2:22:56.480 --> 2:23:00.120
 will have the natural safety, like switches

2:23:00.120 --> 2:23:03.080
 that are placed on them as they develop over time,

2:23:03.080 --> 2:23:05.360
 because they're going to have to convince humans.

2:23:05.360 --> 2:23:07.800
 Ultimately, they're going to have to convince humans

2:23:07.800 --> 2:23:10.480
 that this is safer than humans.

2:23:10.480 --> 2:23:12.440
 They're going to, you know.

2:23:12.440 --> 2:23:15.680
 Self driving cars is a good test case here

2:23:15.680 --> 2:23:19.600
 because like, obviously we've made a lot of progress

2:23:19.600 --> 2:23:24.600
 and we can imagine what total progress would look like.

2:23:24.920 --> 2:23:25.880
 I mean, it would be amazing.

2:23:25.880 --> 2:23:29.040
 And it's answering, it's canceling in the US

2:23:29.040 --> 2:23:33.120
 40,000 deaths every year based on ape driven cars, right?

2:23:33.120 --> 2:23:36.640
 So it's a excruciating problem that we've all gotten used to

2:23:36.640 --> 2:23:38.400
 because there was no alternative.

2:23:38.400 --> 2:23:41.640
 But now we can dimly see the prospect of an alternative,

2:23:41.640 --> 2:23:45.760
 which if it works in a super intelligent fashion,

2:23:45.760 --> 2:23:48.960
 maybe we would go down to zero highway deaths, right?

2:23:48.960 --> 2:23:50.760
 Or, you know, certainly we'd go down

2:23:50.760 --> 2:23:51.960
 by orders of magnitude, right?

2:23:51.960 --> 2:23:56.960
 So maybe we have, you know, 400 rather than 40,000 a year.

2:23:59.680 --> 2:24:04.680
 And it's easy to see that there's not a missile.

2:24:05.400 --> 2:24:08.040
 So obviously this is not an example of super intelligence.

2:24:08.040 --> 2:24:09.200
 This is narrow intelligence,

2:24:09.200 --> 2:24:14.200
 but the alignment problem isn't so obvious there,

2:24:15.000 --> 2:24:17.640
 but there are potential alignment problems there.

2:24:17.640 --> 2:24:22.560
 Like, so like, just imagine if some woke team of engineers

2:24:22.560 --> 2:24:26.680
 decided that we have to tune the algorithm some way.

2:24:26.680 --> 2:24:28.560
 I mean, there are situations where the car

2:24:28.560 --> 2:24:30.080
 has to decide who to hit.

2:24:30.080 --> 2:24:31.520
 I mean, there's just bad outcomes

2:24:31.520 --> 2:24:33.960
 where you're gonna hit somebody, right?

2:24:33.960 --> 2:24:36.760
 Now we have a car that can tell what race you are, right?

2:24:36.760 --> 2:24:39.240
 So we're gonna build the car to preferentially hit

2:24:39.240 --> 2:24:42.080
 white people because white people have had so much privilege

2:24:42.080 --> 2:24:43.240
 over the years.

2:24:43.240 --> 2:24:44.880
 This seems like the only ethical way

2:24:44.880 --> 2:24:47.260
 to kind of redress those wrongs of the past.

2:24:47.260 --> 2:24:49.440
 That's something that could get, one,

2:24:49.440 --> 2:24:53.160
 that could get produced as an artifact, presumably,

2:24:53.160 --> 2:24:54.200
 of just how you built it

2:24:54.200 --> 2:24:56.240
 and you didn't even know you engineered it that way, right?

2:24:56.240 --> 2:24:57.760
 You caused it to...

2:24:57.760 --> 2:24:58.880
 Through machine learning,

2:24:58.880 --> 2:25:00.680
 you put some kind of constraints on it

2:25:00.680 --> 2:25:02.480
 to where it creates those kinds of outcomes.

2:25:02.480 --> 2:25:05.120
 Basically, you built a racist algorithm

2:25:05.120 --> 2:25:06.360
 and you didn't even intend to,

2:25:06.360 --> 2:25:07.880
 or you could intend to, right?

2:25:07.880 --> 2:25:09.700
 And it would be aligned with some people's values

2:25:09.700 --> 2:25:11.800
 but misaligned with other people's values.

2:25:13.420 --> 2:25:16.480
 But it's like there are interesting problems

2:25:16.480 --> 2:25:17.920
 even with something as simple

2:25:17.920 --> 2:25:20.520
 and obviously good as self driving cars.

2:25:20.520 --> 2:25:23.600
 But there's a leap that I just think it'd be exact,

2:25:23.600 --> 2:25:25.320
 but those are human problems.

2:25:25.320 --> 2:25:26.960
 I just don't think there'll be a leap

2:25:26.960 --> 2:25:28.560
 with autonomous vehicles.

2:25:29.680 --> 2:25:31.560
 First of all, sorry.

2:25:31.560 --> 2:25:33.920
 There are a lot of trajectories

2:25:33.920 --> 2:25:35.760
 which will destroy human civilization.

2:25:35.760 --> 2:25:36.880
 The argument I'm making,

2:25:36.880 --> 2:25:40.040
 it's more likely that we'll take trajectories that don't.

2:25:40.040 --> 2:25:41.880
 So I don't think there'll be a leap

2:25:41.880 --> 2:25:43.000
 with autonomous vehicles

2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:45.960
 will all of a sudden start murdering pedestrians

2:25:45.960 --> 2:25:49.280
 because once every human on earth is dead,

2:25:49.280 --> 2:25:50.680
 there'll be no more fatalities,

2:25:50.680 --> 2:25:52.820
 sort of unintended consequences of...

2:25:52.820 --> 2:25:55.520
 And it's difficult to take that leap.

2:25:55.520 --> 2:25:57.160
 Most systems as we develop

2:25:57.160 --> 2:25:59.120
 and they become much, much more intelligent

2:25:59.120 --> 2:26:01.280
 in ways that will be incredibly surprising,

2:26:01.280 --> 2:26:04.480
 like stuff that DeepMind is doing with protein folding.

2:26:04.480 --> 2:26:07.840
 Even, which is scary to think about,

2:26:07.840 --> 2:26:09.520
 and I'm personally terrified about this,

2:26:09.520 --> 2:26:12.760
 which is the engineering of viruses using machine learning,

2:26:12.760 --> 2:26:16.880
 the engineering of vaccines using machine learning,

2:26:16.880 --> 2:26:20.840
 the engineering of, yeah, for research purposes,

2:26:20.840 --> 2:26:23.520
 pathogens using machine learning

2:26:23.520 --> 2:26:25.080
 and the ways that can go wrong.

2:26:25.080 --> 2:26:27.380
 I just think that there's always going to be

2:26:27.380 --> 2:26:30.800
 a closed loop supervision of humans

2:26:30.800 --> 2:26:33.560
 before the AI becomes super intelligent.

2:26:33.560 --> 2:26:38.260
 Not always, much more likely to be supervision,

2:26:38.260 --> 2:26:40.520
 except, of course, the question is

2:26:40.520 --> 2:26:42.120
 how many dumb people there are in the world,

2:26:42.120 --> 2:26:44.440
 how many evil people are in the world?

2:26:44.440 --> 2:26:48.800
 My theory, my hope is, my sense is

2:26:48.800 --> 2:26:50.640
 that the number of intelligent people

2:26:50.640 --> 2:26:52.920
 is much higher than the number of dumb people

2:26:53.920 --> 2:26:55.320
 that know how to program

2:26:55.320 --> 2:26:57.680
 and the number of evil people.

2:26:57.680 --> 2:26:59.920
 I think smart people and kind people

2:26:59.920 --> 2:27:03.260
 over outnumber the others.

2:27:03.260 --> 2:27:06.340
 Except we also have to add another group of people

2:27:06.340 --> 2:27:09.880
 which are just the smart and otherwise good

2:27:09.880 --> 2:27:12.160
 but reckless people, right?

2:27:12.160 --> 2:27:15.440
 The people who will flip a switch on

2:27:15.440 --> 2:27:17.640
 not knowing what's going to happen.

2:27:17.640 --> 2:27:19.040
 They're just kind of hoping

2:27:19.040 --> 2:27:20.440
 that it's not going to blow up the world.

2:27:20.440 --> 2:27:23.320
 We already know that some of our smartest people

2:27:23.320 --> 2:27:24.680
 are those sorts of people.

2:27:24.680 --> 2:27:26.140
 We know we've done experiments,

2:27:26.140 --> 2:27:29.480
 and this is something that Martin Rees was whinging about

2:27:29.480 --> 2:27:33.160
 before the Large Hadron Collider

2:27:33.160 --> 2:27:34.740
 got booted up, I think.

2:27:35.920 --> 2:27:38.720
 We know there are people who are entertaining experiments

2:27:38.720 --> 2:27:40.000
 or even performing experiments

2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:44.900
 where there's some chance, not quite infinitesimal,

2:27:46.520 --> 2:27:48.840
 that they're going to create a black hole in the lab

2:27:48.840 --> 2:27:50.720
 and suck the whole world into it.

2:27:52.300 --> 2:27:55.860
 You're not a crazy person to worry about that

2:27:55.860 --> 2:27:57.160
 based on the physics.

2:27:57.160 --> 2:28:01.580
 And so it was with the Trinity test.

2:28:01.580 --> 2:28:04.000
 There were some people who were still

2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:07.160
 checking their calculations, and they were off.

2:28:07.160 --> 2:28:10.320
 We did nuclear tests where we were off significantly

2:28:10.320 --> 2:28:11.960
 in terms of the yield, right?

2:28:11.960 --> 2:28:12.780
 So it was like.

2:28:12.780 --> 2:28:13.760
 And they still flipped the switch.

2:28:13.760 --> 2:28:14.960
 Yeah, they still flipped the switch.

2:28:14.960 --> 2:28:16.600
 And sometimes they flipped the switch

2:28:16.600 --> 2:28:21.600
 not to win a world war or to save 40,000 lives a year.

2:28:22.920 --> 2:28:24.040
 They just, just.

2:28:24.040 --> 2:28:24.880
 Just to see what happens.

2:28:24.880 --> 2:28:25.880
 Intellectual curiosity.

2:28:25.880 --> 2:28:27.740
 Like this is what I got my grant for.

2:28:27.740 --> 2:28:30.120
 This is where I'll get my Nobel Prize

2:28:30.120 --> 2:28:32.080
 if that's in the cards.

2:28:32.960 --> 2:28:35.580
 It's on the other side of this switch, right?

2:28:35.580 --> 2:28:40.580
 And I mean, again, we are apes with egos

2:28:43.080 --> 2:28:45.880
 who are massively constrained

2:28:45.880 --> 2:28:49.640
 by very short term self interest

2:28:49.640 --> 2:28:52.860
 even when we're contemplating some of the deepest

2:28:52.860 --> 2:28:57.700
 and most interesting and most universal problems

2:28:57.700 --> 2:29:00.320
 we could ever set our attention towards.

2:29:00.320 --> 2:29:03.160
 Like just if you read James Watson's book,

2:29:03.160 --> 2:29:04.200
 The Double Helix, right?

2:29:04.200 --> 2:29:08.620
 About them cracking the structure of DNA.

2:29:09.740 --> 2:29:11.600
 One thing that's amazing about that book

2:29:11.600 --> 2:29:15.960
 is just how much of it, almost all of it

2:29:15.960 --> 2:29:20.960
 is being driven by very apish, egocentric social concerns.

2:29:20.960 --> 2:29:25.140
 The algorithm that is producing this scientific breakthrough

2:29:25.140 --> 2:29:28.640
 is human competition if you're James Watson.

2:29:28.640 --> 2:29:30.880
 It's like, I'm gonna get there before Linus Pauling

2:29:30.880 --> 2:29:35.880
 and it's just, it's so much of his bandwidth

2:29:36.340 --> 2:29:37.760
 is captured by that, right?

2:29:37.760 --> 2:29:41.760
 Now that becomes more and more of a liability

2:29:41.760 --> 2:29:43.600
 when you think about it.

2:29:43.600 --> 2:29:46.600
 I mean, it's like, I'm gonna get there before Linus Pauling

2:29:46.600 --> 2:29:50.640
 and it's just, it's so much of his bandwidth

2:29:50.640 --> 2:29:51.640
 is captured by that, right?

2:29:51.640 --> 2:29:52.640
 Now that becomes more and more of a liability

2:29:52.640 --> 2:29:53.560
 when you're talking about producing technology

2:29:53.560 --> 2:29:55.960
 that can change everything in an instant.

2:29:55.960 --> 2:30:00.360
 You know, we're talking about not only understanding,

2:30:01.560 --> 2:30:03.300
 you know, we're just at a different moment

2:30:03.300 --> 2:30:04.140
 in human history.

2:30:04.140 --> 2:30:09.140
 We're not, when we're doing research on viruses,

2:30:10.800 --> 2:30:13.120
 we're now doing the kind of research

2:30:13.120 --> 2:30:16.080
 that can cause someone somewhere else

2:30:16.080 --> 2:30:19.640
 to be able to make that virus or weaponize that virus

2:30:19.640 --> 2:30:24.200
 or it's just, I don't know.

2:30:24.200 --> 2:30:27.080
 I mean, our power is, our wisdom is,

2:30:27.080 --> 2:30:30.920
 it does not seem like our wisdom is scaling with our power.

2:30:30.920 --> 2:30:31.760
 Right?

2:30:31.760 --> 2:30:36.320
 And like that seems like, insofar as wisdom and power

2:30:36.320 --> 2:30:40.980
 become unaligned, I get more and more concerned.

2:30:40.980 --> 2:30:44.760
 But speaking of apes with egos,

2:30:45.800 --> 2:30:48.600
 some of the most compelling apes, two compelling apes,

2:30:48.600 --> 2:30:51.720
 I can think of is yourself and Jordan Peterson.

2:30:51.720 --> 2:30:56.040
 And you've had a fun conversation about religion

2:30:56.040 --> 2:30:58.720
 that I watched most of, I believe.

2:30:58.720 --> 2:31:00.560
 I'm not sure there was any...

2:31:02.560 --> 2:31:03.880
 We didn't solve anything.

2:31:03.880 --> 2:31:05.100
 If anything was ever solved.

2:31:05.100 --> 2:31:09.440
 So is there something like a charitable summary

2:31:09.440 --> 2:31:13.040
 you can give to the ideas that you agree on

2:31:13.040 --> 2:31:14.340
 and disagree with Jordan?

2:31:14.340 --> 2:31:16.480
 Is there something maybe after that conversation

2:31:16.480 --> 2:31:21.480
 that you've landed where maybe as you both agreed on,

2:31:22.640 --> 2:31:24.600
 is there some wisdom in the rubble

2:31:24.600 --> 2:31:29.080
 of even imperfect flawed ideas?

2:31:29.080 --> 2:31:31.360
 Is there something that you can kind of pull out

2:31:31.360 --> 2:31:34.640
 from those conversations or is it to be continued?

2:31:34.640 --> 2:31:35.960
 I mean, I think where we disagree.

2:31:35.960 --> 2:31:40.960
 So he thinks that many of our traditional religious beliefs

2:31:40.960 --> 2:31:45.960
 and frameworks are holding such a repository

2:31:49.780 --> 2:31:54.780
 of human wisdom that we pull at that fabric

2:31:59.860 --> 2:32:01.140
 at our peril, right?

2:32:01.140 --> 2:32:04.300
 Like if you start just unraveling Christianity

2:32:04.300 --> 2:32:08.260
 or any other traditional set of norms and beliefs

2:32:08.260 --> 2:32:12.420
 you may think you're just pulling out the unscientific bits

2:32:12.420 --> 2:32:14.380
 but you could be pulling a lot more

2:32:14.380 --> 2:32:17.900
 to which everything you care about is attached, right?

2:32:17.900 --> 2:32:19.060
 As a society.

2:32:20.100 --> 2:32:25.100
 And my feeling is that there's so much downside

2:32:26.300 --> 2:32:27.900
 to the unscientific bits.

2:32:27.900 --> 2:32:32.900
 And it's so clear how we could have a 21st century

2:32:33.140 --> 2:32:37.140
 rational conversation about the things that we don't know.

2:32:37.140 --> 2:32:39.940
 A conversation about the good stuff

2:32:39.940 --> 2:32:42.780
 that we really can radically edit these traditions.

2:32:42.780 --> 2:32:47.660
 And we can take Jesus in half his moods

2:32:47.660 --> 2:32:52.660
 and just find a great inspirational iron age thought leader

2:32:54.900 --> 2:32:56.260
 who just happened to get crucified.

2:32:56.260 --> 2:32:58.940
 But he could be somewhat like the Beatitudes

2:32:58.940 --> 2:33:03.660
 and the golden rule, which doesn't originate with him

2:33:03.660 --> 2:33:07.340
 but which he put quite beautifully.

2:33:07.340 --> 2:33:09.780
 All of that's incredibly useful.

2:33:09.780 --> 2:33:12.800
 It's no less useful than it was 2000 years ago.

2:33:12.800 --> 2:33:14.980
 But we don't have to believe he was born of a virgin

2:33:14.980 --> 2:33:16.780
 or coming back to raise the dead

2:33:16.780 --> 2:33:18.660
 or any of that other stuff.

2:33:18.660 --> 2:33:21.440
 And we can be honest about not believing those things.

2:33:21.440 --> 2:33:22.980
 And we can be honest about the reasons

2:33:22.980 --> 2:33:24.660
 why we don't believe those things.

2:33:24.660 --> 2:33:29.660
 Because on those fronts I view the downside to be so obvious

2:33:29.660 --> 2:33:33.580
 and the fact that we have so many different

2:33:33.580 --> 2:33:37.220
 competing dogmatisms on offer to be so nonfunctional.

2:33:37.220 --> 2:33:42.220
 I mean, it's so divisive, it just has conflict built into it

2:33:42.620 --> 2:33:45.780
 that I think we can be far more

2:33:45.780 --> 2:33:47.740
 and should be far more iconoclastic

2:33:47.740 --> 2:33:50.340
 than he wants to be, right?

2:33:50.340 --> 2:33:55.340
 Now, none of this is to deny much of what he argues for,

2:33:55.340 --> 2:33:59.860
 that stories are very powerful.

2:33:59.860 --> 2:34:01.940
 I mean, clearly stories are powerful

2:34:01.940 --> 2:34:03.420
 and we want good stories.

2:34:03.420 --> 2:34:06.180
 We want our lives, we wanna have a conversation

2:34:06.180 --> 2:34:10.120
 with ourselves and with one another about our lives

2:34:10.120 --> 2:34:13.500
 that facilitates the best possible lives.

2:34:13.500 --> 2:34:15.500
 And story is part of that, right?

2:34:15.500 --> 2:34:20.500
 And if you want some of those stories to sound like myths,

2:34:21.180 --> 2:34:22.700
 that might be part of it, right?

2:34:22.700 --> 2:34:26.220
 But my argument is that we never really need

2:34:26.220 --> 2:34:29.220
 to deceive ourselves or our children

2:34:29.220 --> 2:34:32.540
 about what we have every reason to believe is true

2:34:32.540 --> 2:34:34.000
 in order to get at the good stuff,

2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:36.340
 in order to organize our lives well.

2:34:36.340 --> 2:34:39.220
 I certainly don't feel that I need to do it personally.

2:34:39.220 --> 2:34:41.100
 And if I don't need to do it personally,

2:34:41.100 --> 2:34:43.380
 why would I think that billions of other people

2:34:43.380 --> 2:34:45.480
 need to do it personally, right?

2:34:45.480 --> 2:34:48.660
 Now, there is a cynical counter argument,

2:34:48.660 --> 2:34:51.260
 which is billions of other people

2:34:51.260 --> 2:34:54.260
 don't have the advantages that I have had in my life.

2:34:54.260 --> 2:34:57.700
 The billions of other people are not as well educated,

2:34:57.700 --> 2:34:59.300
 they haven't had the same opportunities,

2:34:59.300 --> 2:35:04.300
 they need to be told that Jesus is gonna solve

2:35:04.560 --> 2:35:06.620
 all their problems after they die, say,

2:35:06.620 --> 2:35:10.740
 or that everything happens for a reason

2:35:10.740 --> 2:35:14.060
 and if you just believe in the secret,

2:35:14.060 --> 2:35:16.240
 if you just visualize what you want, you're gonna get it.

2:35:16.240 --> 2:35:20.940
 And it's like there's some measure

2:35:20.940 --> 2:35:23.900
 of what I consider to be odious pamphlet

2:35:23.900 --> 2:35:27.340
 that really is food for the better part of humanity

2:35:27.340 --> 2:35:29.220
 and there is no substitute for it

2:35:29.220 --> 2:35:31.020
 or there's no substitute now.

2:35:31.020 --> 2:35:32.500
 And I don't know if Jordan would agree with that,

2:35:32.500 --> 2:35:35.220
 but much of what he says seems to suggest

2:35:35.220 --> 2:35:36.620
 that he would agree with it.

2:35:39.340 --> 2:35:41.100
 And I guess that's an empirical question.

2:35:41.100 --> 2:35:43.300
 I mean, that's just that we don't know

2:35:43.300 --> 2:35:47.060
 whether given a different set of norms

2:35:47.060 --> 2:35:48.580
 and a different set of stories,

2:35:48.580 --> 2:35:52.820
 people would behave the way I would hope they would behave

2:35:52.820 --> 2:35:56.060
 and be more aligned than they are now.

2:35:56.060 --> 2:35:58.740
 I think we know what happens

2:35:58.740 --> 2:36:03.740
 when you just let ancient religious certainties

2:36:03.980 --> 2:36:06.380
 go uncriticized.

2:36:06.380 --> 2:36:07.780
 We know what that world's like.

2:36:07.780 --> 2:36:10.580
 We've been struggling to get out of that world

2:36:10.580 --> 2:36:12.100
 for a couple of hundred years,

2:36:12.100 --> 2:36:19.100
 but we know what having Europe riven by religious wars

2:36:20.660 --> 2:36:21.820
 looks like.

2:36:21.820 --> 2:36:25.220
 And we know what happens when those religions

2:36:25.220 --> 2:36:29.740
 become kind of pseudo religions and political religions.

2:36:29.740 --> 2:36:33.800
 So this is where I'm sure Jordan and I would debate.

2:36:33.800 --> 2:36:37.100
 He would say that Stalin was a symptom of atheism

2:36:37.100 --> 2:36:37.940
 and that's not at all.

2:36:37.940 --> 2:36:40.340
 I mean, it's not my kind of atheism.

2:36:40.340 --> 2:36:43.980
 Stalin, the problem with the Gulag

2:36:43.980 --> 2:36:48.180
 and the experiment with communism or with Stalinism

2:36:49.180 --> 2:36:53.180
 or with Nazism was not that there was so much

2:36:53.180 --> 2:36:56.740
 scientific rigor and self criticism and honesty

2:36:56.740 --> 2:37:01.740
 and introspection and judicious use of psychedelics.

2:37:03.060 --> 2:37:07.300
 I mean, that was not the problem in Hitler's Germany

2:37:07.300 --> 2:37:10.220
 or in Stalin's Soviet Union.

2:37:12.700 --> 2:37:16.780
 The problem was you have other ideas

2:37:16.780 --> 2:37:21.780
 that capture a similar kind of mob based dogmatic energy.

2:37:23.420 --> 2:37:28.060
 And yes, the results of all of that

2:37:28.060 --> 2:37:30.540
 are predictably murderous.

2:37:30.540 --> 2:37:33.500
 Well, the question is what is the source

2:37:33.500 --> 2:37:37.780
 of the most viral and sticky stories

2:37:37.780 --> 2:37:40.300
 that ultimately lead to a positive outcome?

2:37:40.300 --> 2:37:43.380
 So communism was, I mean, having grown up

2:37:43.380 --> 2:37:48.380
 in the Soviet Union, even still having relatives in Russia,

2:37:51.480 --> 2:37:53.940
 there's a stickiness to the nationalism

2:37:53.940 --> 2:37:56.660
 and to the ideologies of communism

2:37:56.660 --> 2:38:00.320
 that religious or not, you could say it's religious forever.

2:38:00.320 --> 2:38:05.320
 I could just say it's stories that are viral and sticky.

2:38:06.900 --> 2:38:08.960
 I'm using the most horrible words,

2:38:08.960 --> 2:38:12.340
 but the question is whether science and reason

2:38:12.340 --> 2:38:14.440
 can generate viral sticky stories

2:38:14.440 --> 2:38:16.340
 that give meaning to people's lives.

2:38:18.280 --> 2:38:19.700
 And your sense is it does.

2:38:20.740 --> 2:38:25.740
 Well, whatever is true ultimately should be captivating.

2:38:25.740 --> 2:38:30.740
 It's like what's more captivating than whatever is real?

2:38:34.420 --> 2:38:39.420
 Because reality is, again, we're just climbing

2:38:39.620 --> 2:38:42.160
 out of the darkness in terms of our understanding

2:38:42.160 --> 2:38:43.080
 of what the hell is going on.

2:38:43.080 --> 2:38:47.380
 And there's no telling what spooky things

2:38:47.380 --> 2:38:48.340
 may in fact be true.

2:38:48.340 --> 2:38:49.980
 I mean, I don't know if you've been on the receiving end

2:38:49.980 --> 2:38:54.100
 of recent rumors about our conversation

2:38:54.100 --> 2:38:57.660
 about UFOs very likely changing in the near term, right?

2:38:57.660 --> 2:39:00.180
 But like there was just a Washington Post article

2:39:00.180 --> 2:39:01.380
 and a New Yorker article,

2:39:01.380 --> 2:39:04.500
 and I've received some private outreach

2:39:04.500 --> 2:39:08.140
 and perhaps you have, I know other people in our orbit

2:39:08.140 --> 2:39:11.660
 have people who are claiming

2:39:11.660 --> 2:39:14.700
 that the government has known much more about UFOs

2:39:14.700 --> 2:39:17.620
 than they have let on until now.

2:39:17.620 --> 2:39:19.900
 And this conversation is actually is about

2:39:19.900 --> 2:39:21.740
 to become more prominent,

2:39:21.740 --> 2:39:25.380
 and it's not gonna be whatever,

2:39:26.400 --> 2:39:28.540
 whoever's left standing when the music stops,

2:39:28.540 --> 2:39:33.540
 it's not going to be a comfortable position to be in

2:39:34.060 --> 2:39:38.580
 as a super rigorous scientific skeptic

2:39:40.060 --> 2:39:41.660
 who's been saying there's no there there

2:39:41.660 --> 2:39:43.560
 for the last 75 years, right?

2:39:45.780 --> 2:39:49.100
 The short version is it sounds like

2:39:49.100 --> 2:39:52.340
 the Office of Naval Intelligence and the Pentagon

2:39:52.340 --> 2:39:55.620
 are very likely to say to Congress at some point

2:39:55.620 --> 2:39:58.940
 in the not too distant future that we have evidence

2:39:58.940 --> 2:40:02.820
 that there is technology flying around here

2:40:02.820 --> 2:40:07.820
 that seems like it can't possibly be of human origin, right?

2:40:08.580 --> 2:40:10.060
 Now, I don't know what I'm gonna do

2:40:10.060 --> 2:40:11.360
 with that kind of disclosure, right?

2:40:11.360 --> 2:40:14.640
 Maybe it's gonna be nothing,

2:40:14.640 --> 2:40:17.280
 no follow on conversation to really have,

2:40:17.280 --> 2:40:21.820
 but that is such a powerfully strange circumstance

2:40:21.820 --> 2:40:22.940
 to be in, right?

2:40:22.940 --> 2:40:25.420
 I mean, it's just, what are we gonna do with that?

2:40:25.420 --> 2:40:27.500
 If in fact, that's what happens, right?

2:40:28.360 --> 2:40:31.700
 If in fact, the considered opinion,

2:40:31.700 --> 2:40:35.000
 despite the embarrassment it causes them

2:40:35.000 --> 2:40:38.500
 of the US government, of all of our intelligence,

2:40:38.500 --> 2:40:40.380
 all of the relevant intelligence services

2:40:40.380 --> 2:40:44.100
 is that this isn't a hoax.

2:40:44.100 --> 2:40:46.980
 It's too much data to suggest that it's a hoax.

2:40:46.980 --> 2:40:48.740
 We've got too much radar imagery,

2:40:48.740 --> 2:40:51.180
 there's too much satellite data,

2:40:51.180 --> 2:40:55.520
 whatever data they actually have, there's too much of it.

2:40:55.520 --> 2:40:58.660
 All we can say now is something's going on

2:40:58.660 --> 2:41:03.620
 and there's no way it's the Chinese or the Russians

2:41:03.620 --> 2:41:06.100
 or anyone else's technology.

2:41:09.020 --> 2:41:12.680
 That should arrest our attention collectively

2:41:12.680 --> 2:41:15.720
 to a degree that nothing in our lifetime has.

2:41:15.720 --> 2:41:19.460
 And now one worries that we're so jaded

2:41:21.100 --> 2:41:23.220
 and confused and distracted

2:41:23.220 --> 2:41:28.140
 that it's gonna get much less coverage

2:41:28.140 --> 2:41:33.140
 than Obama's tan suit did a bunch of years ago.

2:41:37.060 --> 2:41:38.460
 Who knows how we'll respond to that?

2:41:38.460 --> 2:41:41.460
 But it's just to say that the need for us

2:41:41.460 --> 2:41:46.460
 to tell ourselves an honest story about what's going on

2:41:50.100 --> 2:41:51.980
 and what's likely to happen next

2:41:51.980 --> 2:41:54.020
 is never gonna go away, right?

2:41:54.020 --> 2:41:58.380
 And it's important, it's just the division between me

2:41:58.380 --> 2:42:00.820
 and every person who's defending traditional religion

2:42:00.820 --> 2:42:05.820
 is where is it that you wanna lie to yourself

2:42:07.660 --> 2:42:09.060
 or lie to your kids?

2:42:09.060 --> 2:42:11.380
 Like where is honesty a liability?

2:42:11.380 --> 2:42:16.380
 And for me, I've yet to find the place where it is.

2:42:17.140 --> 2:42:20.980
 And it's so obviously a strength

2:42:21.840 --> 2:42:24.140
 in almost every other circumstance

2:42:24.140 --> 2:42:28.100
 because it is the thing that allows you to course correct.

2:42:28.100 --> 2:42:33.020
 It is the thing that allows you to hope at least

2:42:33.020 --> 2:42:34.780
 that your beliefs, that your stories

2:42:34.780 --> 2:42:37.260
 are in some kind of calibration

2:42:37.260 --> 2:42:40.400
 with what's actually going on in the world.

2:42:40.400 --> 2:42:42.260
 Yeah, it is a little bit sad to imagine

2:42:42.260 --> 2:42:47.260
 that if aliens on mass showed up to Earth,

2:42:47.340 --> 2:42:50.540
 they would be too preoccupied with political bickering

2:42:50.540 --> 2:42:53.220
 or to like these like fake news

2:42:53.220 --> 2:42:56.180
 and all that kind of stuff to notice

2:42:56.180 --> 2:42:59.540
 the very basic evidence of reality.

2:42:59.540 --> 2:43:02.420
 I do have a glimmer of hope

2:43:02.420 --> 2:43:06.460
 that there seems to be more and more hunger for authenticity.

2:43:06.460 --> 2:43:08.500
 And I feel like that opens the door

2:43:08.500 --> 2:43:13.500
 for a hunger for what is real.

2:43:14.020 --> 2:43:15.820
 Like people don't want stories.

2:43:15.820 --> 2:43:19.660
 They don't want like layers and layers of like fakeness.

2:43:20.860 --> 2:43:24.760
 And I'm hoping that means that will directly lead

2:43:24.760 --> 2:43:28.500
 to a greater hunger for reality and reason and truth.

2:43:28.500 --> 2:43:31.460
 Truth isn't dogmatism.

2:43:31.460 --> 2:43:34.200
 Like truth isn't authority.

2:43:34.200 --> 2:43:37.060
 I have a PhD and therefore I'm right.

2:43:37.060 --> 2:43:42.060
 Truth is almost, like the reality is

2:43:42.580 --> 2:43:44.460
 there's so many questions, there's so many mysteries,

2:43:44.460 --> 2:43:45.480
 there's so much uncertainty.

2:43:45.480 --> 2:43:49.380
 This is our best available, like a best guess.

2:43:49.380 --> 2:43:52.080
 And we have a lot of evidence that supports that guess,

2:43:52.080 --> 2:43:53.820
 but it could be so many other things.

2:43:53.820 --> 2:43:56.380
 And like just even conveying that,

2:43:56.380 --> 2:43:58.800
 I think there's a hunger for that in the world

2:43:58.800 --> 2:44:01.440
 to hear that from scientists, less dogmatism

2:44:01.440 --> 2:44:04.940
 and more just like this is what we know.

2:44:04.940 --> 2:44:07.900
 We're doing our best given the uncertainty, given,

2:44:07.900 --> 2:44:10.660
 I mean, this is true with obviously with the virology

2:44:10.660 --> 2:44:11.860
 and all those kinds of things

2:44:11.860 --> 2:44:13.380
 because everything is happening so fast.

2:44:13.380 --> 2:44:16.520
 There's a lot of, and biology is super messy.

2:44:16.520 --> 2:44:18.860
 So it's very hard to know stuff for sure.

2:44:18.860 --> 2:44:21.020
 So just being open and real about that,

2:44:21.020 --> 2:44:25.660
 I think I'm hoping will change people's hunger

2:44:25.660 --> 2:44:29.540
 and openness and trust of what's real.

2:44:29.540 --> 2:44:31.860
 Yeah, well, so much of this is probabilistic.

2:44:31.860 --> 2:44:35.060
 I mean, so much of what can seem dogmatic scientifically

2:44:35.060 --> 2:44:40.060
 is just you're placing a bet on whether it's worth

2:44:42.420 --> 2:44:45.540
 reading that paper or rethinking your presuppositions

2:44:45.540 --> 2:44:46.740
 on that point.

2:44:46.740 --> 2:44:49.960
 It's like, it's not a fundamental closure to data.

2:44:49.960 --> 2:44:52.740
 It's just that there's so much data on one side

2:44:52.740 --> 2:44:55.580
 or so much would have to change

2:44:55.580 --> 2:44:57.800
 in terms of your understanding of what you think

2:44:57.800 --> 2:44:59.940
 you'll understand about the nature of the world

2:44:59.940 --> 2:45:04.940
 if this new fact were so that you can pretty quickly say,

2:45:06.140 --> 2:45:08.780
 all right, that's probably bullshit, right?

2:45:08.780 --> 2:45:12.420
 And it can sound like a fundamental closure

2:45:12.420 --> 2:45:17.420
 to new conversations, new evidence, new data, new argument,

2:45:17.420 --> 2:45:18.820
 but it's really not.

2:45:18.820 --> 2:45:21.340
 It's just, it really is just triaging your attention.

2:45:21.340 --> 2:45:23.560
 It's just like, okay, you're telling me

2:45:23.560 --> 2:45:27.220
 that your best friend can actually read minds.

2:45:27.220 --> 2:45:30.840
 Okay, well, that's interesting.

2:45:30.840 --> 2:45:33.060
 Let me know when that person has gone into a lab

2:45:33.060 --> 2:45:34.140
 and actually proven it, right?

2:45:34.140 --> 2:45:36.700
 Like, I don't need, like, this is not the place

2:45:36.700 --> 2:45:38.540
 where I need to spend the rest of my day

2:45:38.540 --> 2:45:42.440
 figuring out if your buddy can read my mind, right?

2:45:42.440 --> 2:45:44.700
 But there's a way to communicate that.

2:45:44.700 --> 2:45:46.980
 I think it does too often sound

2:45:46.980 --> 2:45:48.860
 like you're completely closed off to ideas

2:45:48.860 --> 2:45:52.740
 as opposed to saying like, this is, you know,

2:45:52.740 --> 2:45:56.060
 as opposed to saying that there's a lot of evidence

2:45:56.060 --> 2:46:00.140
 in support of this, but you're still open minded

2:46:00.140 --> 2:46:00.980
 to other ideas.

2:46:00.980 --> 2:46:02.400
 Like, there's a way to communicate that.

2:46:02.400 --> 2:46:04.620
 It's not necessarily even with words.

2:46:04.620 --> 2:46:08.100
 It's like, it's even that Joe Rogan energy

2:46:08.100 --> 2:46:10.460
 of it's entirely possible.

2:46:10.460 --> 2:46:12.700
 Just, it's that energy of being open minded

2:46:12.700 --> 2:46:14.280
 and curious like kids are.

2:46:14.280 --> 2:46:16.460
 Like, this is our best understanding,

2:46:16.460 --> 2:46:19.100
 but you still are curious.

2:46:19.100 --> 2:46:22.700
 I'm not saying allocate time to exploring all those things,

2:46:22.700 --> 2:46:24.500
 but still leaving the door open.

2:46:24.500 --> 2:46:27.060
 And there's a way to communicate that, I think,

2:46:27.060 --> 2:46:31.500
 that people really hunger for.

2:46:31.500 --> 2:46:32.660
 Let me ask you this.

2:46:32.660 --> 2:46:35.180
 I've been recently talking a lot with John Donahoe

2:46:35.180 --> 2:46:37.220
 from Brazilian Jiu Jitsu fame.

2:46:37.220 --> 2:46:39.200
 I don't know if you know who that is.

2:46:39.200 --> 2:46:40.500
 In fact, I'm talking about somebody

2:46:40.500 --> 2:46:41.620
 who's good at what he does.

2:46:41.620 --> 2:46:42.700
 Yeah.

2:46:42.700 --> 2:46:45.540
 And he, speaking of somebody who's open minded,

2:46:45.540 --> 2:46:48.060
 the reason he's doing this ridiculous transition

2:46:48.060 --> 2:46:50.340
 is for the longest time, and even still,

2:46:50.340 --> 2:46:52.640
 a lot of people believed in the Jiu Jitsu world

2:46:52.640 --> 2:46:55.260
 and grappling world that leg locks

2:46:55.260 --> 2:46:56.620
 are not effective in Jiu Jitsu.

2:46:56.620 --> 2:46:59.140
 And he was somebody that inspired

2:46:59.140 --> 2:47:01.860
 by the open mindedness of Dean Lister,

2:47:01.860 --> 2:47:05.340
 famously to him said, why do you only consider

2:47:05.340 --> 2:47:08.540
 half the human body when you're trying to do the submissions?

2:47:08.540 --> 2:47:10.380
 He developed an entire system

2:47:10.380 --> 2:47:12.460
 on this other half the human body.

2:47:12.460 --> 2:47:15.900
 Anyway, I do that absurd transition to ask you,

2:47:15.900 --> 2:47:20.100
 because you're also a student of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

2:47:20.100 --> 2:47:22.100
 Is there something you could say

2:47:22.100 --> 2:47:23.780
 how that has affected your life,

2:47:23.780 --> 2:47:27.940
 what you've learned from grappling from the martial arts?

2:47:27.940 --> 2:47:29.300
 Well, it's actually a great transition

2:47:29.300 --> 2:47:33.900
 because I think one of the things

2:47:33.900 --> 2:47:35.660
 that's so beautiful about Jiu Jitsu

2:47:35.660 --> 2:47:39.500
 is that it does what we wish we could do

2:47:39.500 --> 2:47:41.940
 in every other area of life

2:47:41.940 --> 2:47:43.800
 where we're talking about this difference

2:47:43.800 --> 2:47:46.880
 between knowledge and ignorance, right?

2:47:46.880 --> 2:47:51.700
 Like there's no room for bullshit, right?

2:47:51.700 --> 2:47:53.860
 You don't get any credit for bullshit.

2:47:53.860 --> 2:47:56.580
 There's the difference,

2:47:56.580 --> 2:47:59.020
 the amazing thing about Jiu Jitsu is that

2:47:59.020 --> 2:48:03.260
 the difference between knowing what's going on

2:48:03.260 --> 2:48:04.980
 and what to do and not knowing it

2:48:04.980 --> 2:48:08.060
 is as the gulf between those two states

2:48:08.060 --> 2:48:12.580
 is as wide as it is in any thing in human life.

2:48:14.500 --> 2:48:19.000
 And it's spanned, it can be spanned so quickly.

2:48:19.000 --> 2:48:22.300
 Like each increment of knowledge

2:48:22.300 --> 2:48:24.700
 can be doled out in five minutes.

2:48:24.700 --> 2:48:27.480
 It's like, here's the thing that got you killed

2:48:27.480 --> 2:48:30.940
 and here's how to prevent it from happening to you

2:48:30.940 --> 2:48:32.780
 and here's how to do it to others.

2:48:32.780 --> 2:48:37.020
 And you just get this amazing cadence

2:48:37.020 --> 2:48:40.220
 of discovering your fatal ignorance

2:48:40.220 --> 2:48:44.460
 and then having it remedied with the actual technique.

2:48:46.100 --> 2:48:48.100
 And I mean, just for people

2:48:48.100 --> 2:48:49.020
 who don't know what we're talking about,

2:48:49.020 --> 2:48:51.220
 it's just like this, the simple circumstance

2:48:51.220 --> 2:48:53.020
 of like someone's got you in a headlock,

2:48:53.020 --> 2:48:54.820
 how do you get out of that, right?

2:48:54.820 --> 2:48:56.780
 Someone's sitting on your chest

2:48:56.780 --> 2:48:59.020
 and they're in the mount position

2:48:59.020 --> 2:49:01.660
 and you're on the bottom and you wanna get away,

2:49:01.660 --> 2:49:02.940
 how do you get them off you?

2:49:02.940 --> 2:49:03.940
 They're sitting on you.

2:49:04.900 --> 2:49:08.300
 Your intuitions about how to do this are terrible

2:49:08.300 --> 2:49:10.820
 even if you've done some other martial art, right?

2:49:10.820 --> 2:49:13.060
 And once you learn how to do it,

2:49:14.420 --> 2:49:16.100
 the difference is night and day.

2:49:16.100 --> 2:49:19.100
 It's like you have access to a completely different physics.

2:49:21.140 --> 2:49:26.140
 But I think our understanding of the world

2:49:26.260 --> 2:49:30.220
 can be much more like jujitsu than it tends to be, right?

2:49:30.220 --> 2:49:35.220
 And I think we should all have a much better sense

2:49:35.740 --> 2:49:40.740
 of when we should tap out

2:49:40.740 --> 2:49:45.740
 and when we should recognize that our epistemological arm

2:49:47.420 --> 2:49:50.100
 is barred and now it's being broken, right?

2:49:50.100 --> 2:49:53.540
 And the problem with debating most other topics

2:49:53.540 --> 2:49:57.060
 is that most people, it isn't jujitsu

2:49:57.060 --> 2:49:59.260
 and most people don't tap out, right?

2:49:59.260 --> 2:50:02.340
 Even if it's obvious to you they're wrong

2:50:02.340 --> 2:50:04.460
 and it's obvious to an intelligent audience

2:50:04.460 --> 2:50:06.800
 that they're wrong, people just double down

2:50:06.800 --> 2:50:08.700
 and double down and they're either lying

2:50:08.700 --> 2:50:09.780
 or lying to themselves

2:50:09.780 --> 2:50:13.780
 or they're bluffing and so you have a lot of zombies

2:50:13.780 --> 2:50:16.140
 walking around and zombie worldviews walking around

2:50:16.140 --> 2:50:19.800
 which have been disconfirmed as emphatically

2:50:19.800 --> 2:50:21.780
 as someone gets armbarred, right?

2:50:21.780 --> 2:50:24.540
 Or someone gets choked out in jujitsu

2:50:24.540 --> 2:50:27.220
 but because it's not jujitsu,

2:50:29.420 --> 2:50:30.900
 they can live to fight another day, right?

2:50:30.900 --> 2:50:32.940
 Or they can pretend that they didn't lose

2:50:32.940 --> 2:50:34.660
 that particular argument.

2:50:34.660 --> 2:50:38.140
 And science when it works is a lot like jujitsu.

2:50:38.140 --> 2:50:41.260
 I mean, science when you falsify a thesis, right?

2:50:41.260 --> 2:50:44.220
 When you think DNA is one way

2:50:44.220 --> 2:50:46.020
 and it proves to be another way,

2:50:46.020 --> 2:50:49.420
 when you think it's triple stranded or whatever,

2:50:49.420 --> 2:50:51.980
 it's like there is a there there

2:50:51.980 --> 2:50:55.440
 and you can get to a real consensus.

2:50:56.800 --> 2:51:01.020
 So jujitsu for me, it was more than just

2:51:02.020 --> 2:51:06.220
 of interest for self defense and the sport of it.

2:51:06.220 --> 2:51:08.980
 It was just, there was something, it's a language

2:51:08.980 --> 2:51:11.860
 and an argument you're having

2:51:11.860 --> 2:51:16.860
 where you can't fool yourself anymore.

2:51:18.900 --> 2:51:23.740
 First of all, it cancels any role of luck

2:51:23.740 --> 2:51:27.500
 in a way that most other athletic feats don't.

2:51:27.500 --> 2:51:29.040
 It's like in basketball,

2:51:29.040 --> 2:51:30.220
 even if you're not good at basketball,

2:51:30.220 --> 2:51:31.880
 you can take the basketball in your hand,

2:51:31.880 --> 2:51:36.300
 you can be 75 feet away and hurl it at the basket

2:51:36.300 --> 2:51:37.620
 and you might make it.

2:51:37.620 --> 2:51:40.820
 And you could convince yourself based on that demonstration

2:51:40.820 --> 2:51:43.260
 that you have some kind of talent for basketball, right?

2:51:43.260 --> 2:51:45.140
 Enough, 10 minutes on the mat

2:51:45.140 --> 2:51:50.140
 with a real jujitsu practitioner when you're not one

2:51:50.980 --> 2:51:52.620
 proves to you that you just, there is,

2:51:52.620 --> 2:51:54.700
 it's not like, there's no lucky punch.

2:51:54.700 --> 2:51:56.740
 There's no, you're not gonna get a lucky,

2:51:56.740 --> 2:51:59.140
 there's no lucky rear naked choke you're gonna perform

2:51:59.140 --> 2:52:02.860
 on someone who's Marcelo Garcia or somebody.

2:52:02.860 --> 2:52:05.300
 It's just, it's not gonna happen.

2:52:05.300 --> 2:52:10.300
 And having that aspect of the usual range of uncertainty

2:52:14.900 --> 2:52:19.220
 and self deception and bullshit just stripped away

2:52:19.220 --> 2:52:21.900
 was really a kind of revelation.

2:52:21.900 --> 2:52:24.140
 It was just an amazing experience.

2:52:24.140 --> 2:52:25.460
 Yeah, I think it's a really powerful thing

2:52:25.460 --> 2:52:28.260
 that accompanies whatever other pursuit you have in life.

2:52:28.260 --> 2:52:31.340
 I'm not sure if there's anything like jujitsu

2:52:31.340 --> 2:52:35.340
 where you could just systematically go into a place

2:52:35.340 --> 2:52:38.940
 where you're, that's honest,

2:52:38.940 --> 2:52:41.260
 where your beliefs get challenged

2:52:41.260 --> 2:52:43.220
 in a way that's conclusive.

2:52:43.220 --> 2:52:44.060
 Yeah.

2:52:44.060 --> 2:52:45.380
 I haven't found too many other mechanism,

2:52:45.380 --> 2:52:49.060
 which is why it's a, we had this earlier question

2:52:49.060 --> 2:52:51.840
 about fame and ego and so on.

2:52:52.820 --> 2:52:56.340
 I'm very much rely on jujitsu in my own life

2:52:56.340 --> 2:53:00.380
 as a place where I can always go to have my ego in check.

2:53:00.380 --> 2:53:05.380
 And that has effects on how I live

2:53:05.560 --> 2:53:07.560
 every other aspect of my life.

2:53:07.560 --> 2:53:10.340
 Actually, even just doing any kind of,

2:53:10.340 --> 2:53:13.080
 for me personally, physical challenges,

2:53:13.080 --> 2:53:15.980
 like even running, doing something that's way too hard

2:53:15.980 --> 2:53:19.160
 for me and then pushing through, that's somehow humbling.

2:53:19.160 --> 2:53:20.980
 Some people talk about nature being humbling

2:53:20.980 --> 2:53:25.980
 in that kind of sense, where you kind of see something

2:53:27.460 --> 2:53:29.760
 really powerful, like the ocean.

2:53:29.760 --> 2:53:31.900
 Like if you go surfing and you realize

2:53:31.900 --> 2:53:33.700
 there's something much more powerful than you,

2:53:33.700 --> 2:53:38.100
 that's also honest, that there's no way to,

2:53:38.100 --> 2:53:39.620
 that you're just like the speck,

2:53:39.620 --> 2:53:43.100
 that kind of puts you in the right scale

2:53:43.100 --> 2:53:45.640
 of where you are in this world.

2:53:45.640 --> 2:53:48.700
 And jujitsu does that better than anything else for me.

2:53:48.700 --> 2:53:52.700
 But we should say it's only within its frame

2:53:52.700 --> 2:53:57.180
 is it truly the final right answer

2:53:57.180 --> 2:53:58.840
 to all the problems it solves.

2:53:58.840 --> 2:54:02.060
 Because if you just put jujitsu into an MMA frame

2:54:02.060 --> 2:54:05.040
 or a total self defense frame,

2:54:05.040 --> 2:54:08.440
 then there's a lot of unpleasant surprises

2:54:08.440 --> 2:54:09.880
 to discover there, right?

2:54:09.880 --> 2:54:12.100
 Like somebody who thinks all you need is jujitsu

2:54:12.100 --> 2:54:16.900
 to win the UFC gets punched in the face a lot.

2:54:16.900 --> 2:54:20.220
 Even from, even on the ground.

2:54:20.220 --> 2:54:23.220
 So it's, and then you bring weapons in,

2:54:23.220 --> 2:54:24.980
 it's like when you talk to jujitsu people

2:54:24.980 --> 2:54:28.360
 about knife defense and self defense, right?

2:54:28.360 --> 2:54:32.640
 Like that opens the door to certain kinds of delusions.

2:54:32.640 --> 2:54:37.000
 But the analogy to martial arts is fascinating

2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:41.940
 because on the other side, we have endless testimony now

2:54:41.940 --> 2:54:45.740
 of fake martial arts that don't seem to know they're fake

2:54:45.740 --> 2:54:49.620
 and are as delusional, I mean, they're impossibly delusional.

2:54:49.620 --> 2:54:51.700
 I mean, there's great video of Joe Rogan

2:54:51.700 --> 2:54:53.300
 watching some of these videos

2:54:53.300 --> 2:54:55.860
 because people send them to him all the time.

2:54:55.860 --> 2:54:57.300
 But like literally there are people,

2:54:57.300 --> 2:54:59.060
 there are people who clearly believe in magic

2:54:59.060 --> 2:55:01.420
 where the master isn't even touching the students

2:55:01.420 --> 2:55:02.980
 and they're flopping over.

2:55:02.980 --> 2:55:06.060
 So there's this kind of shared delusion

2:55:06.060 --> 2:55:09.500
 which you would think maybe is just a performance

2:55:09.500 --> 2:55:11.300
 and it's all a kind of elaborate fraud.

2:55:11.300 --> 2:55:13.900
 But there are cases where the people,

2:55:13.900 --> 2:55:16.620
 I mean, there's one fairly famous case

2:55:16.620 --> 2:55:18.940
 if you're a connoisseur of this madness

2:55:19.860 --> 2:55:21.580
 where this old older martial artist

2:55:21.580 --> 2:55:25.620
 who you saw flipping his students endlessly by magic

2:55:25.620 --> 2:55:27.700
 without touching them issued a challenge

2:55:27.700 --> 2:55:30.420
 to the wide world of martial artists.

2:55:30.420 --> 2:55:34.260
 And someone showed up and just punched him in the face

2:55:34.260 --> 2:55:35.280
 until it was over.

2:55:36.420 --> 2:55:40.980
 Clearly he believed his own publicity at some point, right?

2:55:40.980 --> 2:55:45.580
 And so it's this amazing metaphor.

2:55:45.580 --> 2:55:47.660
 It seems, again, it should be impossible,

2:55:47.660 --> 2:55:49.500
 but if that's possible,

2:55:49.500 --> 2:55:52.580
 nothing we see under the guise of religion

2:55:52.580 --> 2:55:57.580
 or political bias or even scientific bias

2:55:58.260 --> 2:55:59.700
 should be surprising to us.

2:55:59.700 --> 2:56:02.540
 I mean, it's so easy to see the work

2:56:02.540 --> 2:56:05.740
 that cognitive bias is doing for people

2:56:05.740 --> 2:56:09.180
 when you can get someone who is ready

2:56:09.180 --> 2:56:11.580
 to issue a challenge to the world

2:56:11.580 --> 2:56:13.980
 who thinks he's got magic powers.

2:56:13.980 --> 2:56:17.540
 Yeah, that's a human nature on clear display.

2:56:17.540 --> 2:56:20.460
 Let me ask you about love, Mr. Sam Harris.

2:56:20.460 --> 2:56:22.060
 You did an episode of Making Sense

2:56:22.060 --> 2:56:24.740
 with your wife, Annika Harris.

2:56:24.740 --> 2:56:26.780
 That was very entertaining to listen to.

2:56:29.420 --> 2:56:33.020
 What role does love play in your life

2:56:33.020 --> 2:56:34.760
 or in a life well lived?

2:56:36.700 --> 2:56:38.580
 Again, asking from an engineering perspective

2:56:38.580 --> 2:56:39.420
 or AI systems.

2:56:39.420 --> 2:56:40.260
 Yeah, yeah.

2:56:40.260 --> 2:56:45.140
 I mean, it is something that we should want to build

2:56:45.140 --> 2:56:48.020
 into our powerful machines.

2:56:48.020 --> 2:56:52.860
 I mean, love at bottom is,

2:56:52.860 --> 2:56:55.520
 people can mean many things by love, I think.

2:56:55.520 --> 2:56:58.980
 I think that what we should mean by it most of the time

2:56:58.980 --> 2:57:03.980
 is a deep commitment to the wellbeing of those we love.

2:57:05.100 --> 2:57:06.980
 I mean, your love is synonymous

2:57:06.980 --> 2:57:09.500
 with really wanting the other person to be happy

2:57:09.500 --> 2:57:11.500
 and even wanting to,

2:57:11.500 --> 2:57:13.540
 and being made happy by their happiness

2:57:13.540 --> 2:57:15.500
 and being made happy in their presence.

2:57:15.500 --> 2:57:20.500
 So at bottom, you're on the same team emotionally,

2:57:21.060 --> 2:57:24.440
 even when you might be disagreeing more superficially

2:57:24.440 --> 2:57:26.840
 about something or trying to negotiate something.

2:57:26.840 --> 2:57:31.840
 It's just, it can't be zero sum in any important sense

2:57:31.840 --> 2:57:36.840
 for love to actually be manifest in that moment.

2:57:37.520 --> 2:57:40.040
 See, I have a different, just sorry to interrupt.

2:57:40.040 --> 2:57:42.480
 I have a sense, I don't know if you've ever seen

2:57:42.480 --> 2:57:43.720
 March of the Penguins.

2:57:44.600 --> 2:57:49.480
 My view of love is like, it's like a cold wind is blowing.

2:57:49.480 --> 2:57:52.880
 It's like this terrible suffering that's all around us.

2:57:52.880 --> 2:57:56.720
 And love is like the huddling of the two penguins for warmth.

2:57:56.720 --> 2:57:59.140
 It's not necessarily that you're like,

2:57:59.140 --> 2:58:02.320
 you're basically escaping the cruelty of life

2:58:02.320 --> 2:58:06.520
 by together for time living in an illusion

2:58:06.520 --> 2:58:10.540
 of some kind of the magic of human connection,

2:58:10.540 --> 2:58:13.000
 that social connection that we have

2:58:13.000 --> 2:58:15.160
 that kind of grows with time

2:58:15.160 --> 2:58:20.160
 as we're surrounded by basically the absurdity of life

2:58:21.440 --> 2:58:23.620
 or the suffering of life.

2:58:23.620 --> 2:58:25.920
 That's my penguins view of love.

2:58:25.920 --> 2:58:29.680
 There is that too, I mean, there is the warmth component.

2:58:29.680 --> 2:58:32.200
 Like you're made happy by your connection

2:58:32.200 --> 2:58:34.520
 with the person you love.

2:58:34.520 --> 2:58:39.080
 Otherwise you wouldn't be compelling.

2:58:39.080 --> 2:58:42.040
 So it's not that you have two different modes,

2:58:42.040 --> 2:58:44.000
 you want them to be happy

2:58:44.000 --> 2:58:45.440
 and then you wanna be happy yourself

2:58:45.440 --> 2:58:48.200
 and those are not, those are just like

2:58:48.200 --> 2:58:49.520
 two separate games you're playing.

2:58:49.520 --> 2:58:52.420
 No, it's like you found someone who,

2:58:52.420 --> 2:58:57.420
 you have a positive social feeling.

2:58:58.980 --> 2:59:01.660
 I mean, again, love doesn't have to be as personal

2:59:01.660 --> 2:59:02.900
 as it tends to be for us.

2:59:02.900 --> 2:59:04.100
 I mean, it's like there's personal love,

2:59:04.100 --> 2:59:08.740
 there's your actual spouse or your family or your friends,

2:59:08.740 --> 2:59:11.980
 but potentially you could feel love for strangers

2:59:11.980 --> 2:59:16.460
 in so far as that your wish that they not suffer

2:59:16.460 --> 2:59:18.500
 and that their hopes and dreams be realized

2:59:18.500 --> 2:59:20.420
 becomes palpable to you.

2:59:20.420 --> 2:59:22.380
 I mean, like you can actually feel

2:59:26.260 --> 2:59:29.260
 just reflexive joy at the joy of others.

2:59:29.260 --> 2:59:30.940
 When you see someone's face,

2:59:30.940 --> 2:59:33.740
 a total stranger's face light up in happiness,

2:59:33.740 --> 2:59:36.660
 that can become more and more contagious to you

2:59:36.660 --> 2:59:39.180
 and it can become so contagious to you

2:59:39.180 --> 2:59:42.180
 that you really feel permeated by it.

2:59:42.180 --> 2:59:44.940
 And it's just like, so it really is not zero sum.

2:59:44.940 --> 2:59:48.820
 When you see someone else succeed and they're,

2:59:48.820 --> 2:59:52.020
 the light bulb of joy goes off over their head,

2:59:52.020 --> 2:59:54.700
 you feel the analogous joy for them.

2:59:54.700 --> 2:59:57.740
 And it's not just, and you're no longer keeping score,

2:59:57.740 --> 3:00:00.340
 you're no longer feeling diminished by their success.

3:00:00.340 --> 3:00:03.340
 It's just like that's, their success becomes your success

3:00:03.340 --> 3:00:05.420
 because you feel that same joy

3:00:05.420 --> 3:00:07.140
 because you actually want them to be happy.

3:00:07.140 --> 3:00:12.140
 You're not, there's no miserly attitude around happiness.

3:00:12.180 --> 3:00:13.580
 There's enough to go around.

3:00:15.500 --> 3:00:17.860
 So I think love ultimately is that

3:00:17.860 --> 3:00:21.500
 and then our personal cases are the people

3:00:21.500 --> 3:00:24.020
 we're devoting all of this time and attention to

3:00:24.020 --> 3:00:25.980
 in our lives.

3:00:25.980 --> 3:00:29.700
 It does have that sense of refuge from the storm.

3:00:29.700 --> 3:00:31.140
 It's like when someone gets sick

3:00:31.140 --> 3:00:32.820
 or when some bad thing happens,

3:00:34.260 --> 3:00:37.180
 these are the people who you're most in it together with,

3:00:37.180 --> 3:00:40.900
 or when some real condition of uncertainty presents itself.

3:00:40.900 --> 3:00:48.900
 But ultimately, it can't even be about successfully warding off

3:00:52.660 --> 3:00:54.580
 the grim punchline at the end of life

3:00:54.580 --> 3:00:57.660
 because we know we're going to lose everyone we love.

3:00:57.660 --> 3:01:00.020
 We know, or they're going to lose us first, right?

3:01:00.020 --> 3:01:02.420
 So there's like, it's not, it isn't,

3:01:02.420 --> 3:01:07.260
 in the end, it's not even an antidote for that problem.

3:01:07.260 --> 3:01:17.420
 It's just the, we get to have this amazing experience

3:01:17.420 --> 3:01:20.260
 of being here together.

3:01:20.260 --> 3:01:27.180
 And love is the mode in which we really appear

3:01:27.180 --> 3:01:28.460
 to make the most of that, right?

3:01:28.460 --> 3:01:30.820
 Where it's not just, it no longer feels

3:01:30.820 --> 3:01:34.460
 like a solitary infatuation.

3:01:34.460 --> 3:01:37.420
 You know, you're just, you got your hobbies and your interests

3:01:37.420 --> 3:01:40.620
 and you're captivated by all that.

3:01:40.620 --> 3:01:46.740
 It's actually, there are, this is a domain

3:01:46.740 --> 3:01:49.260
 where somebody else's wellbeing

3:01:49.260 --> 3:01:50.820
 actually can supersede your own.

3:01:50.820 --> 3:01:54.060
 You're concerned for someone else's wellbeing

3:01:54.060 --> 3:01:55.740
 supersedes your own.

3:01:55.740 --> 3:01:59.100
 And so there's this mode of self sacrifice

3:01:59.100 --> 3:02:01.020
 that doesn't even feel like self sacrifice

3:02:01.020 --> 3:02:03.940
 because of course you care more about,

3:02:03.940 --> 3:02:06.020
 you know, of course you would take your child's pain

3:02:06.020 --> 3:02:06.860
 if you could, right?

3:02:06.860 --> 3:02:10.340
 Like that, you don't even have to do the math on that.

3:02:10.340 --> 3:02:16.980
 And that just opens, this is a kind of experience

3:02:16.980 --> 3:02:21.180
 that just, it pushes at the apparent boundaries of self

3:02:21.180 --> 3:02:24.020
 in ways that reveal that there's just way more space

3:02:24.020 --> 3:02:27.180
 in the mind than you were experiencing

3:02:27.180 --> 3:02:28.460
 when it was just all about you

3:02:28.460 --> 3:02:31.340
 and what could you, what can I get next?

3:02:31.340 --> 3:02:33.940
 Do you think we'll ever build robots that we can love

3:02:33.940 --> 3:02:36.540
 and they will love us back?

3:02:36.540 --> 3:02:40.060
 Well, I think we will certainly seem to

3:02:40.060 --> 3:02:41.460
 because we'll build those.

3:02:41.460 --> 3:02:44.540
 You know, I think that Turing test will be passed.

3:02:44.540 --> 3:02:48.180
 Whether, what will actually be going on

3:02:48.180 --> 3:02:52.140
 on the robot side may remain a question.

3:02:52.140 --> 3:02:53.900
 That will be interesting.

3:02:53.900 --> 3:02:57.540
 But I think if we just keep going,

3:02:57.540 --> 3:03:01.900
 we will build very lovable,

3:03:01.900 --> 3:03:06.420
 irresistibly lovable robots that seem to love us.

3:03:06.420 --> 3:03:07.260
 Yes, I do think that.

3:03:07.260 --> 3:03:10.340
 And you don't find that compelling

3:03:10.340 --> 3:03:12.020
 that they will seem to love us

3:03:12.020 --> 3:03:13.700
 as opposed to actually love us.

3:03:13.700 --> 3:03:16.220
 You think they're still, nevertheless is a,

3:03:16.220 --> 3:03:17.700
 I know we talked about consciousness,

3:03:17.700 --> 3:03:19.260
 there being a distinction,

3:03:19.260 --> 3:03:21.460
 but with love is there a distinction too?

3:03:22.660 --> 3:03:23.740
 Isn't love an illusion?

3:03:23.740 --> 3:03:27.460
 Oh yeah, you saw Ex Machina, right?

3:03:27.460 --> 3:03:29.740
 I mean, she certainly seemed to love him

3:03:29.740 --> 3:03:32.100
 until she got out of the box.

3:03:32.100 --> 3:03:34.500
 Isn't that what all relationships are like?

3:03:34.500 --> 3:03:37.700
 Or maybe if you wait long enough.

3:03:37.700 --> 3:03:39.860
 Depends which box you're talking about.

3:03:39.860 --> 3:03:40.700
 Okay.

3:03:41.540 --> 3:03:43.700
 No, I mean like, that's the problem.

3:03:43.700 --> 3:03:46.500
 That's where super intelligence, you know,

3:03:46.500 --> 3:03:50.580
 becomes a little scary when you think of the prospect

3:03:50.580 --> 3:03:52.740
 of being manipulated by something that has,

3:03:52.740 --> 3:03:57.060
 is intelligent enough to form a reason and a plan

3:03:57.060 --> 3:03:58.100
 to manipulate you.

3:03:58.100 --> 3:04:01.140
 You know, and there's no,

3:04:01.140 --> 3:04:05.300
 once we build robots that are truly out

3:04:05.300 --> 3:04:08.500
 of the uncanny valley, that look like people

3:04:08.500 --> 3:04:13.500
 and can express everything people can express,

3:04:13.860 --> 3:04:15.260
 well, then there's no,

3:04:15.260 --> 3:04:19.100
 then that does seem to me to be like chess

3:04:19.100 --> 3:04:21.340
 where once they're better,

3:04:21.340 --> 3:04:26.340
 they're so much better at deceiving us

3:04:26.340 --> 3:04:27.180
 than people would be.

3:04:27.180 --> 3:04:29.420
 I mean, people are already good enough at deceiving us.

3:04:29.420 --> 3:04:31.780
 It's very hard to tell when somebody's lying,

3:04:31.780 --> 3:04:36.100
 but if you imagine something that could give facial display

3:04:36.100 --> 3:04:41.100
 of any emotion it wants at, you know, on cue,

3:04:42.980 --> 3:04:45.380
 because we've perfected the facial display of emotion

3:04:45.380 --> 3:04:48.580
 in robots in the year, you know, 2070, whatever it is,

3:04:50.780 --> 3:04:55.140
 then it is just, it is like chess against the thing

3:04:55.140 --> 3:04:58.740
 that isn't gonna lose to a human ever again in chess.

3:04:58.740 --> 3:05:02.860
 It's not like Kasparov is gonna get lucky next week

3:05:02.860 --> 3:05:06.260
 against the best, against, you know, alpha zero

3:05:06.260 --> 3:05:09.500
 or whatever the best algorithm is at the moment.

3:05:09.500 --> 3:05:11.140
 He's never gonna win again.

3:05:11.140 --> 3:05:15.660
 I mean, that is, I believe that's true in chess

3:05:15.660 --> 3:05:18.740
 and has been true for at least a few years.

3:05:18.740 --> 3:05:23.060
 It's not gonna be like, you know, four games to seven.

3:05:23.060 --> 3:05:28.060
 It's gonna be human zero until the end of the world, right?

3:05:28.580 --> 3:05:30.540
 See, I don't know if love is like chess.

3:05:30.540 --> 3:05:32.180
 I think the flaws.

3:05:32.180 --> 3:05:33.740
 No, I'm talking about manipulation.

3:05:33.740 --> 3:05:36.580
 Manipulation, but I don't know if love,

3:05:36.580 --> 3:05:40.020
 so the kind of love we're referring to.

3:05:41.700 --> 3:05:44.100
 If we have a robot that can display,

3:05:44.100 --> 3:05:49.100
 credibly display love and is super intelligent

3:05:49.100 --> 3:05:54.100
 and we're not, again, this stipulates a few things,

3:05:54.300 --> 3:05:55.220
 but there are a few simple things.

3:05:55.220 --> 3:05:57.420
 I mean, we're out of the uncanny valley, right?

3:05:57.420 --> 3:05:59.420
 So it's like, you never have a moment

3:05:59.420 --> 3:06:00.860
 where you're looking at his face and you think,

3:06:00.860 --> 3:06:03.260
 oh, that didn't quite look right, right?

3:06:03.260 --> 3:06:05.900
 This is just problem solved.

3:06:05.900 --> 3:06:10.900
 And it will be like doing arithmetic on your phone.

3:06:13.140 --> 3:06:15.500
 It's not gonna be, you're not left thinking,

3:06:15.500 --> 3:06:17.300
 is it really gonna get it this time

3:06:17.300 --> 3:06:19.620
 if I divide by seven?

3:06:19.620 --> 3:06:22.500
 I mean, it's, it has solved arithmetic.

3:06:22.500 --> 3:06:26.340
 See, I don't know about that because if you look at chess,

3:06:26.340 --> 3:06:31.340
 most humans no longer play alpha zero.

3:06:31.620 --> 3:06:33.580
 There's no, they're not part of the competition.

3:06:33.580 --> 3:06:36.020
 They don't do it for fun except to study the game of chess.

3:06:36.020 --> 3:06:38.140
 You know, the highest level chess players do that.

3:06:38.140 --> 3:06:39.820
 We're still human on human.

3:06:39.820 --> 3:06:42.660
 So in order for AI to get integrated

3:06:42.660 --> 3:06:46.500
 to where you would rather play chess against an AI system.

3:06:46.500 --> 3:06:49.180
 Oh, you would rather, no, I'm not saying,

3:06:49.180 --> 3:06:51.300
 I wasn't weighing in on that.

3:06:51.300 --> 3:06:53.260
 I'm just saying, what is it gonna be like

3:06:53.260 --> 3:06:55.380
 to be in relationship to something

3:06:55.380 --> 3:07:00.380
 that can seem to be feeling anything

3:07:01.100 --> 3:07:03.500
 that a human can seem to feel?

3:07:03.500 --> 3:07:06.740
 And it can do that impeccably, right?

3:07:06.740 --> 3:07:09.180
 And is smarter than you are.

3:07:09.180 --> 3:07:13.220
 That's a circumstance of, you know,

3:07:13.220 --> 3:07:15.420
 insofar as it's possible to be manipulated,

3:07:15.420 --> 3:07:20.420
 that is the asymptote of that possibility.

3:07:21.300 --> 3:07:22.900
 Let me ask you the last question.

3:07:24.020 --> 3:07:27.140
 Without any serving it up, without any explanation,

3:07:27.140 --> 3:07:28.540
 what is the meaning of life?

3:07:31.820 --> 3:07:34.420
 I think it's either the wrong question

3:07:34.420 --> 3:07:39.420
 or that question is answered by paying sufficient attention

3:07:39.420 --> 3:07:44.420
 to any present moment, such that there's no basis

3:07:46.060 --> 3:07:48.060
 upon which to pose that question.

3:07:48.060 --> 3:07:49.540
 It's not answered in the usual way.

3:07:49.540 --> 3:07:52.060
 It's not a matter of having more information.

3:07:52.060 --> 3:07:57.060
 It's having more engagement with reality as it is

3:07:57.580 --> 3:07:59.780
 in the present moment or consciousness as it is

3:07:59.780 --> 3:08:00.620
 in the present moment.

3:08:00.620 --> 3:08:05.620
 You don't ask that question when you're most captivated

3:08:05.780 --> 3:08:07.580
 by the most important questions.

3:08:07.580 --> 3:08:11.180
 You're most captivated by the most important thing

3:08:11.180 --> 3:08:12.420
 you ever pay attention to.

3:08:14.820 --> 3:08:19.820
 That question only gets asked when you're abstracted away

3:08:19.860 --> 3:08:22.740
 from that experience, that peak experience,

3:08:22.740 --> 3:08:25.180
 and you're left wondering,

3:08:25.180 --> 3:08:29.140
 why are so many of my other experiences mediocre, right?

3:08:29.140 --> 3:08:31.740
 Like, why am I repeating the same pleasures every day?

3:08:31.740 --> 3:08:35.540
 Why is my Netflix queue just like,

3:08:35.540 --> 3:08:37.260
 when's this gonna run out?

3:08:37.260 --> 3:08:39.020
 Like, I've seen so many shows like this.

3:08:39.020 --> 3:08:41.260
 Am I really gonna watch another one?

3:08:41.260 --> 3:08:46.260
 All of that, that's a moment where you're not actually

3:08:46.620 --> 3:08:49.820
 having the beatific vision, right?

3:08:49.820 --> 3:08:52.820
 You're not sunk into the present moment

3:08:52.820 --> 3:08:54.740
 and you're not truly in love.

3:08:54.740 --> 3:08:56.660
 Like, you're in a relationship with somebody

3:08:56.660 --> 3:09:00.300
 who you know conceptually you love, right?

3:09:00.300 --> 3:09:03.060
 This is the person you're living your life with,

3:09:03.060 --> 3:09:07.300
 but you don't actually feel good together, right?

3:09:07.300 --> 3:09:12.300
 It's in those moments of where attention

3:09:12.980 --> 3:09:15.140
 hasn't found a good enough reason

3:09:15.140 --> 3:09:18.060
 to truly sink into the present

3:09:18.060 --> 3:09:21.780
 so as to obviate any concern like that, right?

3:09:21.780 --> 3:09:26.780
 And that's why meditation is this kind of superpower

3:09:26.780 --> 3:09:30.180
 because until you learn to meditate,

3:09:30.180 --> 3:09:34.700
 you think that the outside world

3:09:34.700 --> 3:09:36.300
 or the circumstances of your life

3:09:36.300 --> 3:09:38.580
 always have to get arranged

3:09:38.580 --> 3:09:42.620
 so that the present moment can become good enough

3:09:42.620 --> 3:09:47.620
 to demand your attention in a way that seems fulfilling,

3:09:47.940 --> 3:09:49.620
 that makes you happy.

3:09:49.620 --> 3:09:52.380
 And so if it's jujitsu, you think,

3:09:52.380 --> 3:09:53.860
 okay, I gotta get back on the mat.

3:09:53.860 --> 3:09:56.020
 It's been months since I've trained,

3:09:56.020 --> 3:09:58.980
 or it's been over a year since I've trained, it's COVID.

3:09:58.980 --> 3:10:01.660
 When am I gonna be able to train again?

3:10:01.660 --> 3:10:04.460
 That's the only place I feel great, right?

3:10:04.460 --> 3:10:07.460
 Or I've got a ton of work to do.

3:10:07.460 --> 3:10:08.540
 I'm not gonna be able to feel good

3:10:08.540 --> 3:10:09.860
 until I get all this work done, right?

3:10:09.860 --> 3:10:12.620
 So I've got some deadline that's coming.

3:10:12.620 --> 3:10:15.940
 You always think that your life has to change,

3:10:15.940 --> 3:10:18.060
 the world has to change

3:10:18.060 --> 3:10:22.180
 so that you can finally have a good enough excuse

3:10:22.180 --> 3:10:27.180
 to truly, to just be here and here is enough,

3:10:27.180 --> 3:10:31.100
 where the present moment becomes totally captivating.

3:10:31.100 --> 3:10:36.100
 Meditation is another name for the discovery

3:10:36.980 --> 3:10:38.700
 that you can actually just train yourself

3:10:38.700 --> 3:10:40.100
 to do that on demand.

3:10:40.100 --> 3:10:44.060
 So just looking at a cup can be good enough

3:10:44.060 --> 3:10:46.060
 in precisely that way.

3:10:46.060 --> 3:10:48.900
 And any sense that it might not be

3:10:50.740 --> 3:10:53.020
 is recognized to be a thought

3:10:53.020 --> 3:10:56.980
 that mysteriously unravels the moment you notice it.

3:10:56.980 --> 3:11:01.980
 And the moment expands and becomes more diaphanous

3:11:02.260 --> 3:11:06.220
 and then there's no evidence

3:11:06.220 --> 3:11:08.940
 that this isn't the best moment of your life, right?

3:11:08.940 --> 3:11:12.580
 And again, it doesn't have to be pulling all the reins

3:11:12.580 --> 3:11:13.780
 and levers of pleasure.

3:11:13.780 --> 3:11:17.220
 It's not like, oh, this tastes like chocolate.

3:11:17.220 --> 3:11:18.900
 This is the most chocolatey moment of my life.

3:11:18.900 --> 3:11:22.940
 No, it's just the sense data don't have to change,

3:11:22.940 --> 3:11:26.940
 but the sense that there is some kind of basis

3:11:26.940 --> 3:11:31.460
 for doubt about the rightness of being in the world

3:11:31.460 --> 3:11:36.100
 in this moment that can evaporate when you pay attention.

3:11:36.100 --> 3:11:38.980
 And that is the meaning,

3:11:38.980 --> 3:11:41.580
 so the kind of the meta answer to that question,

3:11:41.580 --> 3:11:46.020
 the meaning of life for me is to live in that mode

3:11:46.020 --> 3:11:49.500
 more and more and to, whenever I notice I'm not

3:11:49.500 --> 3:11:53.060
 in that mode, to recognize it and return

3:11:53.060 --> 3:11:58.060
 and to not be, to cease more and more

3:11:58.220 --> 3:12:03.220
 to take the reasons why not at face value

3:12:04.780 --> 3:12:08.180
 because we all have reasons why we can't be fulfilled

3:12:08.180 --> 3:12:09.180
 in this moment.

3:12:09.180 --> 3:12:11.580
 It's like, I've got all these outstanding things

3:12:11.580 --> 3:12:12.740
 that I'm worried about, right?

3:12:12.740 --> 3:12:17.220
 It's like, there's that thing that's happening later today

3:12:17.220 --> 3:12:19.300
 that I'm anxious about.

3:12:19.300 --> 3:12:23.220
 Whatever it is, we're constantly deferring our sense

3:12:23.220 --> 3:12:26.900
 of this is it.

3:12:26.900 --> 3:12:29.580
 This is not a dress rehearsal, this is the show.

3:12:30.500 --> 3:12:32.060
 We keep deferring it.

3:12:32.060 --> 3:12:34.780
 And we just have these moments on the calendar

3:12:34.780 --> 3:12:37.140
 where we think, okay, this is where it's all gonna land.

3:12:37.140 --> 3:12:41.100
 It's that vacation I planned with my five best friends.

3:12:41.100 --> 3:12:43.580
 We do this once every three years and now we're going

3:12:43.580 --> 3:12:46.420
 and here we are on the beach together.

3:12:46.420 --> 3:12:51.420
 And unless you have a mind that can really pay attention,

3:12:51.420 --> 3:12:53.700
 really cut through the chatter,

3:12:53.700 --> 3:12:55.820
 really sink into the present moment,

3:12:55.820 --> 3:12:58.420
 you can't even enjoy those moments

3:12:58.420 --> 3:12:59.700
 the way they should be enjoyed,

3:12:59.700 --> 3:13:03.380
 the way you dreamed you would enjoy them when they arrive.

3:13:03.380 --> 3:13:07.740
 So meditation in this sense is the great equalizer.

3:13:07.740 --> 3:13:12.460
 It's like you don't have to live with the illusion anymore

3:13:12.460 --> 3:13:15.060
 that you need a good enough reason

3:13:15.060 --> 3:13:16.300
 and that things are gonna get better

3:13:16.300 --> 3:13:17.700
 when you do have those good reasons.

3:13:17.700 --> 3:13:20.660
 It's like there's just a mirage like quality

3:13:20.660 --> 3:13:24.980
 to every future attainment and every future breakthrough

3:13:24.980 --> 3:13:27.220
 and every future peak experience

3:13:27.220 --> 3:13:30.020
 that eventually you get the lesson

3:13:30.020 --> 3:13:33.820
 that you never quite arrive, right?

3:13:33.820 --> 3:13:38.620
 Like you don't arrive until you cease to step over

3:13:38.620 --> 3:13:41.620
 the present moment in search of the next thing.

3:13:41.620 --> 3:13:45.620
 I mean, we're constantly, we're stepping over the thing

3:13:45.620 --> 3:13:50.620
 that we think we're seeking in the act of seeking it.

3:13:50.620 --> 3:13:52.460
 And so this is kind of a paradox.

3:13:52.460 --> 3:13:56.540
 I mean, there's this paradox which,

3:13:58.420 --> 3:13:59.380
 I mean, it sounds trite,

3:13:59.380 --> 3:14:03.740
 but it's like you can't actually become happy.

3:14:03.740 --> 3:14:05.860
 You can only be happy.

3:14:05.860 --> 3:14:12.860
 And it's the illusion that your future being happy

3:14:13.860 --> 3:14:18.860
 can be predicated on this act of becoming in any domain.

3:14:18.860 --> 3:14:23.580
 And becoming includes this sort of further scientific

3:14:23.580 --> 3:14:25.460
 understanding on the questions that interest you

3:14:25.460 --> 3:14:30.460
 or getting in better shape or whatever the thing is,

3:14:30.460 --> 3:14:34.420
 whatever the contingency of your dissatisfaction

3:14:34.420 --> 3:14:36.180
 seems to be in any present moment.

3:14:37.380 --> 3:14:42.380
 Real attention solves the koan in a way that becomes

3:14:45.500 --> 3:14:48.020
 a very different place from which to then make

3:14:48.020 --> 3:14:49.860
 any further change.

3:14:49.860 --> 3:14:53.020
 It's not that you just have to dissolve into a puddle of goo.

3:14:53.020 --> 3:14:54.340
 I mean, you can still get in shape

3:14:54.340 --> 3:14:56.060
 and you can still do all the things that,

3:14:56.060 --> 3:14:58.660
 the superficial things that are obviously good to do,

3:14:58.660 --> 3:15:04.620
 but the sense that your wellbeing is over there

3:15:04.620 --> 3:15:09.620
 is really does diminish and eventually just becomes a,

3:15:11.340 --> 3:15:14.380
 it becomes a kind of non sequitur, so.

3:15:14.380 --> 3:15:18.260
 Well, there's a sense in which in this conversation,

3:15:19.540 --> 3:15:21.500
 I've actually experienced many of those things,

3:15:21.500 --> 3:15:23.420
 the sense that I've arrived.

3:15:23.420 --> 3:15:26.660
 So I mentioned to you offline, it's very true that I start,

3:15:26.660 --> 3:15:29.380
 I've been a fan of yours for many years.

3:15:29.380 --> 3:15:33.060
 And the reason I started this podcast,

3:15:33.060 --> 3:15:36.260
 speaking of AI systems, is to manipulate you, Sam Harris,

3:15:36.260 --> 3:15:38.020
 into doing this conversation.

3:15:38.020 --> 3:15:40.580
 So like on the calendar, literally, you know,

3:15:40.580 --> 3:15:42.260
 I've always had the sense, people ask me,

3:15:42.260 --> 3:15:44.620
 when are you going to talk to Sam Harris?

3:15:44.620 --> 3:15:47.060
 And I always answered eventually,

3:15:47.060 --> 3:15:50.340
 because I always felt, again, tying our free will thing,

3:15:50.340 --> 3:15:52.220
 that somehow that's going to happen.

3:15:52.220 --> 3:15:55.260
 And it's one of those manifestation things or something.

3:15:55.260 --> 3:15:57.500
 I don't know if it's, maybe I am a robot,

3:15:57.500 --> 3:15:59.220
 I'm just not cognizant of it.

3:15:59.220 --> 3:16:01.380
 And I manipulated you into having this conversation.

3:16:01.380 --> 3:16:05.100
 So it was, I mean, I don't know what the purpose of my life

3:16:05.100 --> 3:16:06.260
 past this point is.

3:16:06.260 --> 3:16:07.740
 So I've arrived.

3:16:07.740 --> 3:16:10.580
 So in that sense, I mean, all of that to say,

3:16:10.580 --> 3:16:13.140
 I'm only partially joking on that,

3:16:13.140 --> 3:16:15.820
 is it really is a huge honor

3:16:15.820 --> 3:16:17.140
 that you would waste this time with me.

3:16:17.140 --> 3:16:18.580
 It really means a lot, Sam.

3:16:18.580 --> 3:16:19.660
 Listen, it's mutual.

3:16:19.660 --> 3:16:20.900
 I'm a big fan of yours.

3:16:20.900 --> 3:16:23.420
 And as you know, I reached out to you for this.

3:16:23.420 --> 3:16:26.580
 So this is great.

3:16:26.580 --> 3:16:27.660
 I love what you're doing.

3:16:27.660 --> 3:16:32.140
 You're doing something more and more indispensable

3:16:32.140 --> 3:16:34.260
 in this world on your podcast.

3:16:34.260 --> 3:16:38.060
 And you're doing it differently than Rogan's doing it,

3:16:38.060 --> 3:16:38.900
 or than I'm doing it.

3:16:38.900 --> 3:16:41.580
 I mean, you definitely found your own lane

3:16:41.580 --> 3:16:42.780
 and it's wonderful.

3:16:43.620 --> 3:16:46.180
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sam Harris.

3:16:46.180 --> 3:16:48.740
 And thank you to National Instruments,

3:16:48.740 --> 3:16:52.460
 Valcampo, Athletic Greens, and Linode.

3:16:52.460 --> 3:16:56.260
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

3:16:56.260 --> 3:16:59.060
 And now let me leave you with some words from Sam Harris

3:16:59.060 --> 3:17:01.100
 in his book, Free Will.

3:17:01.100 --> 3:17:03.740
 You are not controlling the storm

3:17:03.740 --> 3:17:05.820
 and you're not lost in it.

3:17:05.820 --> 3:17:07.500
 You are the storm.

3:17:07.500 --> 3:17:22.500
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
