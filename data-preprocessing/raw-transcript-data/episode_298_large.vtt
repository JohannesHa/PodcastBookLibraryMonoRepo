00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
 People whose favorite songs are their happy songs,

00:02.800 --> 00:05.680
 play it on their playlist about 175 times.

00:05.680 --> 00:08.880
 The people who love sad music, play them about 800 times.

00:10.880 --> 00:14.080
 And they say that they feel connected to the sublime

00:14.080 --> 00:16.160
 when they're listening to that music.

00:16.160 --> 00:19.440
 The longing for what you lack is the very thing

00:19.440 --> 00:21.800
 that gives you what you're longing for.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.160
 So the longing is the cure.

00:25.600 --> 00:28.520
 The following is a conversation with Susan Cain,

00:28.520 --> 00:32.240
 author of Quiet, The Power of Introverts in the World

00:32.240 --> 00:34.000
 That Can't Stop Talking,

00:34.000 --> 00:36.720
 and her most recent book, Bittersweet,

00:36.720 --> 00:39.640
 How Sorrow and Longing Make Us Whole.

00:40.720 --> 00:43.840
 This is the Lex Readman podcast, support it.

00:43.840 --> 00:46.480
 Please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:46.480 --> 00:50.160
 And now, dear friends, here's Susan Cain.

00:51.080 --> 00:53.040
 You've written on your website that, quote,

00:53.040 --> 00:57.120
 I prefer listening to talking, reading to socializing,

00:57.120 --> 01:00.240
 and cozy chats to group settings.

01:00.240 --> 01:02.080
 So I think this conversation and the podcast

01:02.080 --> 01:03.440
 is gonna be fun.

01:03.440 --> 01:05.840
 What's a good definition of an introvert?

01:05.840 --> 01:09.320
 Is something like those three things a good start?

01:10.200 --> 01:13.440
 It is a good start in terms of how introverts

01:13.440 --> 01:15.240
 experience day to day life.

01:16.200 --> 01:20.000
 I think a good definition is one that some of your listeners

01:20.000 --> 01:21.760
 will have heard many times before,

01:21.760 --> 01:24.320
 the idea of where do you get your energy?

01:24.320 --> 01:26.440
 And for some people, they get their energy more

01:26.440 --> 01:29.560
 from quieter settings, and for other people,

01:29.560 --> 01:31.880
 they get it more from being out there.

01:31.880 --> 01:35.240
 So a good rule of thumb is to imagine that you're

01:35.240 --> 01:36.880
 at a party that you're really enjoying,

01:36.880 --> 01:39.360
 and you've been there for about two hours or so,

01:39.360 --> 01:41.240
 and it's with people you really like,

01:41.240 --> 01:43.800
 and it's in your favorite place, so it's all good.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.720
 An extrovert in a setting like that

01:46.720 --> 01:49.120
 is gonna feel charged up,

01:49.120 --> 01:51.360
 and they're gonna be looking for the after party.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.920
 And an introvert, no matter how good a time they're having

01:53.920 --> 01:55.760
 and how socially skilled they are,

01:55.760 --> 01:57.920
 there's this moment where you just wish

01:57.920 --> 02:00.600
 that you could teleport and be back at home.

02:00.600 --> 02:03.720
 Yeah, and at the time before the start of the party

02:03.720 --> 02:05.880
 to the time when that moment happens

02:05.880 --> 02:07.080
 is different for different people.

02:07.080 --> 02:09.280
 So the shorter that is, the more of an inch where you are?

02:09.280 --> 02:10.640
 Is that that kind of thing?

02:10.640 --> 02:13.120
 The shorter the moment until you get to the place

02:13.120 --> 02:14.600
 where you've gotta teleport home.

02:14.600 --> 02:15.720
 You gotta teleport home.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.520
 Yeah, and then for extroverts, it's the opposite.

02:18.520 --> 02:22.520
 They're gonna feel, maybe they're working on,

02:22.520 --> 02:25.040
 I don't know, focused on producing a memo

02:25.040 --> 02:27.520
 that's really intensely interesting to them,

02:27.520 --> 02:31.240
 but if they're in that state of solitary,

02:31.240 --> 02:33.360
 the solitary mode of really focusing,

02:33.360 --> 02:35.480
 they might get stir crazy a lot faster

02:35.480 --> 02:37.040
 than an introvert would.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.280
 And so it doesn't have so much to do

02:38.280 --> 02:42.440
 with what you're good at as how you get your energy.

02:42.440 --> 02:46.640
 And so for an introvert, the source of energy

02:46.640 --> 02:47.480
 is what?

02:47.480 --> 02:50.800
 Silence, solitude, and for an extrovert,

02:50.800 --> 02:53.120
 it's interaction with other people?

02:53.120 --> 02:54.520
 What I'd really say is that,

02:54.520 --> 02:56.560
 and this is neurobiological as well,

02:56.560 --> 02:59.960
 is that it has to do with how your nervous system

02:59.960 --> 03:01.760
 reacts to stimulation.

03:01.760 --> 03:04.640
 So for an introvert, you're feeling

03:04.640 --> 03:06.360
 in a great state of equilibrium

03:06.360 --> 03:09.480
 when there are fewer inputs coming at you.

03:09.480 --> 03:10.960
 So they could be social inputs,

03:10.960 --> 03:12.760
 but that's why an introvert in general

03:12.760 --> 03:15.680
 would rather hang out with one close friend at a time

03:15.680 --> 03:18.160
 as opposed to a big party full of strangers

03:18.160 --> 03:21.080
 because that's too many inputs for the nervous system.

03:21.080 --> 03:23.560
 And for an extrovert, the nervous system

03:23.560 --> 03:25.960
 needs more stimulants, so if they're not getting enough,

03:25.960 --> 03:28.560
 they get that listless and sluggish feeling.

03:28.560 --> 03:31.640
 So if you're just walking through the world,

03:31.640 --> 03:34.960
 like people listening to this, but in general,

03:34.960 --> 03:37.200
 how do you know if you're an introvert?

03:37.200 --> 03:40.360
 Like how do you empirically start to determine

03:40.360 --> 03:43.640
 if you are in large part an introvert?

03:43.640 --> 03:46.560
 Well, I would start by just asking that question

03:46.560 --> 03:49.280
 of what happens to you at around the two hour mark

03:49.280 --> 03:50.120
 where you're having a good time.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.600
 Go to parties, just go to parties every day.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.080
 But I also find, I'm curious if you have

03:55.080 --> 03:56.200
 a different experience from this,

03:56.200 --> 03:58.880
 but from all the years that I've been out there

03:58.880 --> 04:02.160
 talking about this topic, I found that most people

04:02.160 --> 04:05.480
 really seem to know once they're being honest

04:05.480 --> 04:08.040
 with themselves, and maybe that's the question to ask

04:08.040 --> 04:11.720
 is like if you imagine that you have a Saturday

04:11.720 --> 04:14.320
 or a whole weekend where you can spend your time

04:14.320 --> 04:18.120
 exactly the way you want to with no professional obligations

04:18.120 --> 04:21.400
 and no social obligations, who would you spend it with?

04:21.400 --> 04:24.360
 How many people, what would you be doing?

04:24.360 --> 04:27.040
 And what does that picture that you're painting

04:27.040 --> 04:28.180
 start to look like?

04:29.160 --> 04:31.840
 Yeah, so there's nuance to this though

04:31.840 --> 04:35.080
 because I'm sure for extroverts to get energized

04:35.080 --> 04:38.000
 by stimulation, whether that's stimulation

04:38.000 --> 04:39.520
 with other people, like it depends

04:39.520 --> 04:41.760
 what that stimulation is, right?

04:41.760 --> 04:43.280
 Like maybe you're not surrounded

04:43.280 --> 04:46.680
 by the kind of people that you enjoy being around.

04:46.680 --> 04:50.960
 So, you know, maybe that has to do less

04:50.960 --> 04:54.240
 with whether some characteristics of your personality

04:54.240 --> 04:56.840
 more has to do with the fact, like what your environment

04:56.840 --> 04:59.640
 is like, that's always kind of the question.

04:59.640 --> 05:01.600
 Do you want to be alone because everybody around you

05:01.600 --> 05:03.240
 is an asshole, or do you want to be alone

05:03.240 --> 05:05.400
 because you get energized from being?

05:05.400 --> 05:07.880
 Well, I would hold the variables constant, I guess.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.120
 I would say.

05:09.120 --> 05:09.960
 You know.

05:09.960 --> 05:11.720
 Keep the assholes constant and see.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.080
 And then there's the other thing you kind of observe

05:15.080 --> 05:17.920
 that there's a lot of people that will say

05:17.920 --> 05:20.480
 they get energized from being alone.

05:20.480 --> 05:24.760
 Like people are exhausting to them or something like that.

05:24.760 --> 05:27.960
 But at the same time, when you see them at a party,

05:27.960 --> 05:30.560
 they seem like the life of the party.

05:30.560 --> 05:31.400
 I know.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.600
 And I hear from those people all the time.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.840
 There's so many people like that.

05:34.840 --> 05:37.200
 What would you classify them as exactly?

05:37.200 --> 05:39.560
 Is it ultimately as the source of energy?

05:39.560 --> 05:40.760
 Is it the most important thing?

05:40.760 --> 05:43.640
 Or like how the heck are they the life of the party?

05:43.640 --> 05:45.480
 It's a bunch of different things, you know.

05:45.480 --> 05:48.920
 So first of all, just to say like a big caveat

05:48.920 --> 05:52.600
 to all of this is humans are just amazingly complex.

05:52.600 --> 05:55.880
 So you can't explain every individual human

05:55.880 --> 05:56.840
 through these parameters,

05:56.840 --> 05:59.680
 even though I think the parameters are really valuable.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.400
 But that person at the party,

06:01.400 --> 06:04.600
 it could be that they're more of an ambivert.

06:04.600 --> 06:07.160
 So they kind of are more in the middle of the spectrum.

06:07.160 --> 06:10.120
 It basically means someone who's not extremely introverted

06:10.120 --> 06:12.520
 or extremely extroverted, they're kind of in the middle.

06:12.520 --> 06:15.320
 So maybe at a party, their more extroverted side comes out.

06:15.320 --> 06:20.120
 Or it could be an introvert who's gotten really good

06:20.120 --> 06:23.400
 at the skills of acting more like a pseudo extrovert.

06:23.400 --> 06:26.960
 And they pull that up at the moments that they need it.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.480
 So they learn how to fake it.

06:28.480 --> 06:29.320
 Yeah.

06:29.320 --> 06:30.640
 Oh, there's a lot of people like that.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.400
 And I know this because like,

06:32.400 --> 06:34.240
 I think out of all the people on this planet

06:34.240 --> 06:35.200
 you could be talking to,

06:35.200 --> 06:38.120
 I've heard from the most number of those people.

06:38.120 --> 06:41.800
 Like they all come and tell me about their experience

06:41.800 --> 06:44.680
 out in the world presenting a face that's different

06:44.680 --> 06:45.720
 from what they feel.

06:45.720 --> 06:47.840
 So one of the things you talk about is,

06:47.840 --> 06:49.440
 at least in the West, we've constructed

06:49.440 --> 06:50.960
 a picture of success.

06:50.960 --> 06:55.200
 And that picture is usually one of an extrovert.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.160
 Like when you imagine somebody who's a leader,

06:57.160 --> 06:58.640
 who's a successful person,

07:00.000 --> 07:01.960
 that person has some of the qualities

07:01.960 --> 07:03.880
 you would associate with an extrovert.

07:03.880 --> 07:08.720
 And so there's a lot of incentive for faking it.

07:10.120 --> 07:11.760
 Yeah, exactly.

07:11.760 --> 07:12.640
 If you want to be successful,

07:12.640 --> 07:14.880
 you gotta be able to fake it,

07:14.880 --> 07:17.760
 to sort of hang with the rest of the team.

07:17.760 --> 07:19.960
 You have to be able to be outgoing

07:19.960 --> 07:21.280
 and all those kinds of things

07:21.280 --> 07:23.680
 and not be drained by the interaction.

07:23.680 --> 07:26.320
 Yeah, but I mean, there are also a lot of introverts

07:26.320 --> 07:30.080
 who figure out ways to draw on their own strengths

07:30.080 --> 07:33.760
 and they're incredibly connecting and successful

07:33.760 --> 07:36.600
 and they're great leaders and they're not actually faking it.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.960
 They're more just figuring out ways to do it their own way.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.600
 You see a lot of people like that.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.920
 Is there advice, is there lessons you can draw from that,

07:44.920 --> 07:47.840
 from just observing how you can be an introvert

07:47.840 --> 07:49.440
 and be in a leadership position?

07:50.440 --> 07:52.320
 Yeah, it's kind of like a mantra,

07:52.320 --> 07:53.880
 figuring out what your own strengths are

07:53.880 --> 07:55.720
 and how to draw on them.

07:55.720 --> 07:59.920
 I think of a guy I know, Doug Conant,

07:59.920 --> 08:04.000
 who had been the CEO of Campbell Soup for many years.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.280
 He's very introverted.

08:06.280 --> 08:09.360
 He's quite shy also by his own description.

08:09.360 --> 08:13.720
 And he really cares about people.

08:13.720 --> 08:18.560
 And so when he started at Campbell,

08:18.560 --> 08:20.800
 the employee engagement ratings of the company

08:20.800 --> 08:23.520
 were all the way at the bottom of the Fortune 500.

08:23.520 --> 08:25.920
 And by the time he stepped down 10 years later,

08:25.920 --> 08:27.520
 they were all the way at the top.

08:27.520 --> 08:31.440
 And it wasn't that he was going out there

08:31.440 --> 08:34.560
 and schmoozing people, but he really did care.

08:34.560 --> 08:36.520
 So he would find out who were the people

08:36.520 --> 08:38.440
 who had really been contributing

08:38.440 --> 08:42.160
 and he would write to them personal letters of thanks.

08:44.320 --> 08:47.440
 And these letters meant so much to people.

08:47.440 --> 08:49.600
 They would carry them around with them.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.480
 And during his time, the 10 years there,

08:51.480 --> 08:54.560
 he wrote 30,000 of those letters.

08:54.560 --> 08:56.760
 So that was his way of doing it.

08:56.760 --> 08:58.840
 That was his way of drawing on his own strengths.

08:58.840 --> 09:02.040
 And he did that together with, of course,

09:02.040 --> 09:04.000
 you sometimes have to go outside your comfort zone,

09:04.000 --> 09:05.080
 no matter who you are.

09:05.080 --> 09:07.080
 So he was doing plenty of that too.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.560
 It's a kind of combination.

09:08.560 --> 09:11.040
 Yeah, the writing process

09:11.040 --> 09:14.080
 and focusing on the one on one interaction,

09:14.080 --> 09:15.280
 I can definitely relate.

09:15.280 --> 09:16.880
 There's something deeply draining,

09:16.880 --> 09:19.520
 which concerns me about Zoom meetings

09:19.520 --> 09:23.040
 because it's some weird brain manipulation.

09:23.040 --> 09:23.880
 Same here.

09:23.880 --> 09:26.840
 Well, because you're not really engaged,

09:26.840 --> 09:30.440
 but it wears on you the same way that it does a party.

09:30.440 --> 09:34.520
 It feels like you're emptying that bucket

09:34.520 --> 09:37.560
 for the introverts, even though they're not participating

09:37.560 --> 09:38.840
 at all in the meeting.

09:38.840 --> 09:41.320
 I mean, I suppose that's true for physical meetings too,

09:41.320 --> 09:43.600
 but with Zoom meetings, remote meetings,

09:43.600 --> 09:46.360
 it's so much easier to invite a larger number of people

09:46.360 --> 09:47.480
 into the meeting.

09:47.480 --> 09:50.360
 So you're draining more and more of the introvert energy.

09:50.360 --> 09:53.320
 And probably extrovert too, but the introvert definitely.

09:53.320 --> 09:54.440
 I mean, it's interesting.

09:54.440 --> 09:56.320
 I would love to understand that more

09:56.320 --> 09:59.200
 because there's more and more push towards remote work

10:00.480 --> 10:02.880
 without, I think, a deep understanding

10:02.880 --> 10:05.360
 of why these meetings are so draining on people.

10:05.360 --> 10:08.000
 I just anecdotally have heard from that.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.040
 But maybe that's because the managers,

10:10.040 --> 10:11.840
 the people who arrange the meetings,

10:11.840 --> 10:14.640
 are just not sufficiently yet aware

10:14.640 --> 10:16.280
 of the draining nature of them

10:16.280 --> 10:18.200
 so that they pull in too many people,

10:18.200 --> 10:19.600
 they schedule them too regularly,

10:19.600 --> 10:21.880
 so they need to adjust, that kind of thing probably.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.800
 I think people are starting to realize,

10:23.800 --> 10:27.640
 but I would say one reason that Zoom is so draining

10:27.640 --> 10:33.120
 is because you can see your own self presentation

10:33.120 --> 10:35.280
 the whole time if you choose to.

10:35.280 --> 10:38.680
 And when you go into in person, you can't.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.720
 So you're kind of freed of thinking about that.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.680
 So it's like an extra cognitive load

10:42.680 --> 10:44.680
 that you're bearing the whole time.

10:46.240 --> 10:49.880
 And you might want to turn off the camera

10:49.880 --> 10:51.280
 so you can't see yourself, but then you feel like,

10:51.280 --> 10:53.080
 well, I have the ability to,

10:53.080 --> 10:54.640
 so I probably should be doing it.

10:54.640 --> 10:57.920
 And then that alone is a decision that you're making.

10:57.920 --> 11:00.120
 Yeah, there's probably studies on this now happening,

11:00.120 --> 11:02.600
 either have happened or are happening,

11:02.600 --> 11:07.600
 the effect of seeing your own face on camera.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.800
 Because it's reminding you

11:08.800 --> 11:10.480
 that you're supposed to be acting a certain way.

11:10.480 --> 11:13.480
 And that is especially a stressful thing.

11:13.480 --> 11:15.520
 Yeah, you can't be in the moment as much.

11:15.520 --> 11:18.200
 But I mean, for you, you make the decision

11:18.200 --> 11:21.880
 to do all your podcast interviews in person, right?

11:21.880 --> 11:26.040
 And that's even when it's very costly.

11:26.040 --> 11:28.480
 If there's any kind of chemistry

11:28.480 --> 11:31.320
 that contributes at all to the conversation,

11:31.320 --> 11:34.040
 which I think most conversations have chemistry,

11:34.040 --> 11:38.120
 even the boring work meetings, there's something there.

11:38.120 --> 11:40.960
 Because yes, you're trying to solve a particular problem

11:40.960 --> 11:42.720
 at this particular time.

11:42.720 --> 11:46.080
 But underneath it, there's a team building that's happening.

11:46.080 --> 11:50.480
 And honestly, people also have told me about this,

11:50.480 --> 11:54.840
 why they enjoyed the Zoom meetings during the pandemic.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.280
 It's like, they're lonely.

11:56.280 --> 11:57.200
 Yeah, yeah.

11:57.200 --> 12:01.040
 Like they, you know, it's annoying to have to sit

12:01.040 --> 12:03.720
 and listen to folks talk about nothing and so on.

12:03.720 --> 12:05.800
 But they tune in anyway,

12:05.800 --> 12:09.120
 because it's kind of lonely to sit there by yourself.

12:09.120 --> 12:12.480
 And that, I mean, there's a deep connection there

12:12.480 --> 12:13.720
 when you're with other people.

12:13.720 --> 12:17.360
 And that is especially true when they're in person.

12:17.360 --> 12:18.720
 Which is a huge concern for me

12:18.720 --> 12:21.320
 for like more and more offices

12:21.320 --> 12:24.360
 from a capitalist perspective, realizing,

12:24.360 --> 12:27.200
 hey, why are we, why do we have these large office spaces?

12:27.200 --> 12:28.800
 Why do we have to get people together?

12:28.800 --> 12:32.000
 But I think in some deep sense we do.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.600
 But then you also talk about that once we do,

12:34.600 --> 12:38.120
 we wanna protect the introverts.

12:38.120 --> 12:42.200
 Like you don't want the open space, office space,

12:42.200 --> 12:43.720
 which was a big fad for a while.

12:43.720 --> 12:46.360
 I don't know where people stand on that at this point.

12:46.360 --> 12:48.920
 Yeah, I think people are figuring it out in a post pandemic

12:48.920 --> 12:52.280
 context, but I mean, I know what you mean.

12:52.280 --> 12:55.080
 So before I became a writer,

12:55.080 --> 12:57.760
 I was a corporate lawyer for like seven years.

12:57.760 --> 13:02.400
 And literally the only thing I miss from those years

13:02.400 --> 13:06.400
 is hanging out with people at the office.

13:06.400 --> 13:09.120
 Like, I don't know, just some of the funniest moments

13:09.120 --> 13:12.680
 I've had in my life came from being at the office

13:12.680 --> 13:15.000
 until midnight with the other people I was working with.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.520
 So I know exactly what you're talking about.

13:16.520 --> 13:19.160
 Though I will say the office is there at that firm

13:19.160 --> 13:20.720
 and at most firms in those days,

13:20.720 --> 13:22.160
 everybody had their own office.

13:22.160 --> 13:23.640
 So it was like a dorm room,

13:23.640 --> 13:24.960
 where it was like a long hallway

13:24.960 --> 13:27.520
 with everybody in their own little dorm room.

13:27.520 --> 13:29.000
 So you had tons of privacy,

13:29.000 --> 13:31.920
 but you would also come out and hang out with people.

13:31.920 --> 13:34.640
 You could just kind of roam whenever you want.

13:34.640 --> 13:35.480
 Yeah, yeah.

13:35.480 --> 13:38.680
 And whenever you roam, that means you're kind of open.

13:38.680 --> 13:40.760
 You're looking for trouble.

13:40.760 --> 13:42.160
 You're open for interaction.

13:42.160 --> 13:44.560
 And the extent to which you would keep your door open,

13:44.560 --> 13:47.720
 was it wide open or was it half a jar or just a little bit?

13:47.720 --> 13:49.560
 Those were all signals.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.360
 So is there, cause you said reenergize,

13:51.360 --> 13:53.120
 is there, do you like to think,

13:53.120 --> 13:54.880
 and again, the human mind is complicated,

13:54.880 --> 13:57.240
 but do you like to think of it as like a bucket

13:57.240 --> 13:59.600
 that gets refilled for introverts

13:59.600 --> 14:03.680
 in terms of energy of social interaction

14:03.680 --> 14:07.560
 that they're able to handle?

14:07.560 --> 14:09.560
 Do you think of it like that,

14:09.560 --> 14:12.320
 as a bucket that gets emptied and needs to be refilled?

14:12.320 --> 14:13.600
 I think of it, yeah, more or less,

14:13.600 --> 14:15.400
 cause I use the metaphor of a battery

14:15.400 --> 14:16.920
 that gets recharged or not.

14:16.920 --> 14:19.960
 It's basically the same thing, different metaphor.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.440
 But yeah, but just to add on that,

14:21.440 --> 14:24.040
 that there is a layer of complexity to that

14:24.040 --> 14:28.240
 because you could be somebody who

14:29.400 --> 14:32.320
 doesn't want the kind of social life, let's say,

14:32.320 --> 14:35.120
 where you have to be like on and presenting

14:35.120 --> 14:37.160
 and interacting with tons of people all the time,

14:37.160 --> 14:40.080
 but you'd get really lonely if you were just by yourself.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.400
 So what you want is to maybe be in the company

14:42.400 --> 14:44.760
 of a couple of people you know really well.

14:44.760 --> 14:47.640
 Like for me, the pandemic was not actually that hard

14:47.640 --> 14:48.560
 for me personally.

14:48.560 --> 14:50.600
 I mean, I lost family, but I mean,

14:50.600 --> 14:52.720
 from the point of view of what we're talking about,

14:52.720 --> 14:55.480
 it wasn't that hard because I live with my husband

14:55.480 --> 14:57.080
 and my kids.

14:57.080 --> 14:58.280
 So I knew it was hard on the kids

14:58.280 --> 15:00.160
 and I felt badly for them.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.920
 But for me, I was like, you know what?

15:02.920 --> 15:05.880
 I have a lot of social life right here in the house.

15:05.880 --> 15:07.520
 And I can focus and do my work.

15:07.520 --> 15:09.800
 Yeah, like yeah.

15:09.800 --> 15:12.320
 That's the cool thing about the pandemic, I think,

15:12.320 --> 15:14.920
 it helped people figure out how much they love their family.

15:14.920 --> 15:16.280
 I think that's true.

15:16.280 --> 15:17.720
 And while you give you a chance

15:17.720 --> 15:19.920
 to really reconnect with kids,

15:19.920 --> 15:22.200
 with your kids, like really spend time with them,

15:22.200 --> 15:23.400
 it's just fascinating to watch.

15:23.400 --> 15:26.960
 Like people actually, it did strengthen the family unit

15:26.960 --> 15:30.000
 in an often beautiful way,

15:31.000 --> 15:34.600
 which just sucks to have to leave behind at this point.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.360
 Yeah, and I think that's part of what people

15:36.360 --> 15:39.720
 are not gonna wanna go back to that we need to solve for,

15:40.720 --> 15:44.120
 to the extent that work becomes non remote again.

15:44.120 --> 15:45.200
 I think people have just realized

15:45.200 --> 15:47.400
 how precious those aspects of their lives are.

15:47.400 --> 15:51.880
 And for somebody who's in a conventional office job

15:51.880 --> 15:53.800
 where you're going home and seeing your kids

15:53.800 --> 15:56.080
 for an hour before bedtime,

15:56.080 --> 15:58.040
 and that's your interaction with them,

15:58.040 --> 16:01.440
 that's kind of a ridiculous way to set things up.

16:01.440 --> 16:02.680
 It's cool that you can get,

16:02.680 --> 16:05.000
 I think a lot of places give you the option now,

16:05.000 --> 16:05.920
 which is interesting.

16:05.920 --> 16:08.400
 You get to optimize that element of your life.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.080
 Do you take the commute and the office work

16:10.080 --> 16:11.360
 and then the social interaction there?

16:11.360 --> 16:13.760
 Do you focus on the work at home?

16:13.760 --> 16:15.120
 It's also lonely at home,

16:15.120 --> 16:17.640
 but then you get to see your kids if you have kids.

16:17.640 --> 16:20.240
 That's part of the optimization is like,

16:20.240 --> 16:23.600
 I have some options now and I'm gonna try to optimize

16:25.120 --> 16:30.120
 solitude, loneliness, happiness, productivity,

16:30.280 --> 16:34.840
 seeing family, seeing coworkers,

16:34.840 --> 16:36.760
 the chemistry with the team building with the coworkers

16:36.760 --> 16:40.360
 versus just the raw exchange of information

16:40.360 --> 16:41.320
 with the coworkers.

16:41.320 --> 16:44.640
 It's fascinating to see how that kind of evolves.

16:44.640 --> 16:46.400
 Yeah, and then there's the big,

16:46.400 --> 16:49.680
 the third space idea of the spaces

16:49.680 --> 16:52.640
 where you're in a coworking space

16:52.640 --> 16:54.240
 or a cafe or something like that.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.640
 You've got other people around you,

16:55.640 --> 16:58.320
 but you're not exactly interacting with them,

16:58.320 --> 17:00.440
 but they're very much there.

17:00.440 --> 17:02.160
 And that's huge too.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.360
 I don't think we think about that enough.

17:04.360 --> 17:06.320
 Yeah, that energy's there.

17:06.320 --> 17:07.360
 Yeah, yeah.

17:07.360 --> 17:11.800
 I lived in Manhattan for 17 years before we had kids

17:11.800 --> 17:15.520
 and I absolutely loved it.

17:15.520 --> 17:18.680
 I loved it, the feeling of all that energy all around you,

17:18.680 --> 17:21.200
 but you could be anonymous within it.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.280
 To me, it was perfect.

17:22.280 --> 17:23.120
 Yeah, it was beautiful.

17:23.120 --> 17:26.240
 I worked this morning for a few hours,

17:26.240 --> 17:28.560
 programmed for a few hours at a Starbucks.

17:28.560 --> 17:31.920
 And first of all, wearing suits,

17:31.920 --> 17:33.880
 like Manhattan is the one place

17:33.880 --> 17:35.320
 you can kind of fit into that

17:35.320 --> 17:36.680
 because everyone's wearing suits.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.680
 You wear suits every day?

17:38.680 --> 17:39.880
 Well, these days, unfortunately,

17:39.880 --> 17:41.320
 because I get recognized,

17:41.320 --> 17:45.440
 I wear usually not suits on my own life.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.680
 But yeah, I love it.

17:46.680 --> 17:48.800
 I love the way it feels, I don't know.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.280
 And the way I think about the world when I wear a suit,

17:51.280 --> 17:54.760
 I take it seriously as if my life is gonna end today.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.880
 This is what I would want to wear,

17:56.880 --> 17:58.720
 not for physical appearance,

17:58.720 --> 18:02.840
 but for some reason, it makes me feel focused.

18:02.840 --> 18:03.680
 I don't know.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.120
 So even if you're not gonna see anyone,

18:05.120 --> 18:07.080
 you would still put the suit on when you're doing your work?

18:07.080 --> 18:07.920
 Especially then.

18:07.920 --> 18:08.760
 Really?

18:08.760 --> 18:10.480
 Especially then, yeah.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.640
 Yeah, I really love doing that.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.920
 So it tells you seriousness of purpose,

18:14.920 --> 18:15.760
 something like that?

18:15.760 --> 18:16.600
 Yeah, yeah.

18:16.600 --> 18:17.760
 Like everything elevated now?

18:17.760 --> 18:18.600
 I don't know what it is.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.040
 I don't know what I imagine exactly,

18:20.040 --> 18:23.640
 but it's some kind of platonic form

18:23.640 --> 18:26.480
 of a mixture of James Bond

18:26.480 --> 18:29.040
 and like, I don't know who else,

18:29.040 --> 18:31.200
 Richard Feynman, what can I think about

18:31.200 --> 18:32.280
 when I think about a suit?

18:32.280 --> 18:33.640
 You know, I think of Leonard Cohen,

18:33.640 --> 18:37.040
 but he was always wearing suits too, but you know.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.720
 Leonard Cohen is definitely one of my,

18:38.720 --> 18:41.400
 is a tragic human, is a beautiful human being.

18:41.400 --> 18:42.240
 Yeah, yeah.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.520
 Through his words, through his own private life,

18:44.520 --> 18:49.520
 yes, I definitely would think about Leonard Cohen.

18:49.560 --> 18:53.920
 So small talk, that's another thing.

18:53.920 --> 18:57.040
 Is that part of the equation

18:57.040 --> 18:58.800
 of introvert versus extrovert?

18:58.800 --> 18:59.640
 Well.

18:59.640 --> 19:01.080
 How much people enjoy small talk?

19:01.080 --> 19:03.080
 I kind of went into this whole thing

19:03.080 --> 19:04.800
 thinking that it was,

19:04.800 --> 19:07.840
 but from what I've seen, most people have studied,

19:07.840 --> 19:09.960
 is that most people don't like small talk.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.800
 I think that's why people like your podcasts,

19:12.800 --> 19:14.840
 because you're like, forget the small talk,

19:14.840 --> 19:17.440
 I'm going deep into it from the very beginning.

19:17.440 --> 19:19.560
 Yeah, so it's actually, the picture you're painting

19:19.560 --> 19:21.640
 is like the way you started,

19:21.640 --> 19:24.240
 like with your, with the book Quiet,

19:25.480 --> 19:27.840
 and the way you are today is you realize

19:27.840 --> 19:30.640
 the picture may be more complicated.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.440
 Yeah, everything's more complicated.

19:33.960 --> 19:37.240
 I will say with the small talk thing,

19:37.240 --> 19:41.040
 that I'm curious if you have this experience,

19:41.040 --> 19:44.720
 but I find it fantastic to have a career

19:44.720 --> 19:49.720
 where I'm known for anti small talk kinds of topics,

19:49.720 --> 19:51.840
 because it means that anywhere I go,

19:51.840 --> 19:54.280
 like if I show up at a conference or something like that,

19:54.280 --> 19:55.960
 no one does small talk with me.

19:55.960 --> 19:59.360
 They're like telling me about the deep truth of their lives

19:59.360 --> 20:02.440
 from the first hello, and I love that.

20:02.440 --> 20:05.160
 And in normal life, you have to like wade through a lot

20:05.160 --> 20:07.560
 before you know if people are ready to go there.

20:08.600 --> 20:09.440
 Yeah.

20:09.440 --> 20:10.280
 Do you have that experience too?

20:10.280 --> 20:11.520
 No, definitely, definitely,

20:11.520 --> 20:13.520
 with people that know me for sure.

20:13.520 --> 20:16.200
 But you forget how many people feel like they know you

20:16.200 --> 20:17.480
 because of your podcasts.

20:17.480 --> 20:18.960
 Oh, that's what, no, that counts.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.080
 Because I'm a huge fan of podcasts,

20:21.080 --> 20:24.640
 and I feel like before I ever became friends

20:24.640 --> 20:27.800
 with Joe Rogan, I felt like I was friends with him,

20:27.800 --> 20:30.160
 because I was a fan of his podcast.

20:30.160 --> 20:33.160
 So like it was, I feel like it's a friendship.

20:33.160 --> 20:34.600
 I know it's a one way friendship

20:34.600 --> 20:37.080
 with all the people I listen to in podcasts,

20:37.080 --> 20:40.960
 and even people who are no longer with us, like writers.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.360
 I feel like I have a relationship with them.

20:42.360 --> 20:43.320
 Maybe I'm insane.

20:43.320 --> 20:45.080
 No, I totally feel that way.

20:45.080 --> 20:46.760
 That's the whole reason I became a writer.

20:46.760 --> 20:48.400
 Like I'm friends with Leonard Cohen.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.240
 Yeah.

20:50.760 --> 20:52.000
 And he's not aware of it.

20:53.040 --> 20:56.400
 No, but I think that's the whole reason

20:56.400 --> 20:59.760
 for writing or making music or whatever people do.

20:59.760 --> 21:02.880
 It's to be able to have those kinds of connections

21:02.880 --> 21:06.120
 that don't require having to be in a room together,

21:06.120 --> 21:07.560
 because there's only so many people

21:07.560 --> 21:10.760
 you can be in a room with in your lifetime.

21:10.760 --> 21:15.040
 The hard thing is, unfortunately,

21:15.040 --> 21:18.080
 because I value human connection so much,

21:19.600 --> 21:21.960
 and I only have, just like you mentioned,

21:21.960 --> 21:23.840
 sort of a small circle of people

21:23.840 --> 21:26.520
 I'm really close with by design.

21:26.520 --> 21:29.400
 It always hurts me a lot to say goodbye to people.

21:30.280 --> 21:31.280
 Like you meet people,

21:31.280 --> 21:32.720
 and you can tell they're beautiful people.

21:32.720 --> 21:33.560
 They're amazing.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.480
 There's something so fascinating about them.

21:35.480 --> 21:40.160
 They're, they've had a complicated life.

21:40.160 --> 21:41.500
 Like you could see in their eyes

21:41.500 --> 21:44.760
 in the way they tell their story in just a few sentences.

21:44.760 --> 21:45.920
 They've gone through some shit,

21:45.920 --> 21:49.040
 but they've also found some elements of beauty,

21:49.040 --> 21:50.760
 and then you get to realize,

21:50.760 --> 21:52.960
 okay, well, there's a fascinating human here,

21:52.960 --> 21:55.440
 and all you get to say is a few words here and there.

21:55.440 --> 21:58.640
 Like a funny little joke,

21:58.640 --> 22:00.160
 maybe a dark joke here and there,

22:00.160 --> 22:03.200
 and then you just say goodbye, maybe hug it out,

22:03.200 --> 22:04.360
 and you go on your way.

22:04.360 --> 22:06.120
 So like that's a hello and a goodbye,

22:06.120 --> 22:08.040
 and your paths will never cross again.

22:08.040 --> 22:13.000
 That makes me like a sad walk, walk away.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.840
 But I guess I wouldn't have it any other way,

22:14.840 --> 22:16.760
 I suppose, is the reality is.

22:16.760 --> 22:20.520
 In your book, you talk about that sorrow,

22:20.520 --> 22:22.960
 that sadness not being such a bad thing.

22:22.960 --> 22:26.000
 Yeah, and when you just said that,

22:26.000 --> 22:29.040
 I just thought of this one moment in my life

22:29.040 --> 22:32.560
 that I haven't thought of for 20, 30 years or something,

22:32.560 --> 22:34.120
 but it was when I was in law school,

22:34.120 --> 22:38.280
 and a classmate of mine had his friend

22:38.280 --> 22:39.580
 come to visit for the weekend,

22:39.580 --> 22:41.000
 and the three of us hung out a lot,

22:41.000 --> 22:44.440
 and we just had an amazing time.

22:44.440 --> 22:47.680
 And then this other guy who wasn't gonna be coming back

22:47.680 --> 22:52.000
 anytime soon, if at all, sent a postcard to me.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.080
 And the only thing written on the postcard

22:54.080 --> 22:55.840
 was this quote from Oscar Wilde.

22:55.840 --> 22:57.160
 And I don't remember the exact words,

22:57.160 --> 23:00.320
 but it basically said that there's no pain as intense

23:00.320 --> 23:03.600
 as the sorrow of parting from someone

23:03.600 --> 23:05.920
 to whom you've just been introduced.

23:05.920 --> 23:06.880
 Yeah.

23:06.880 --> 23:10.680
 And there was something so intense about that, and so true.

23:10.680 --> 23:13.040
 I think partly also because when you've just been introduced

23:13.040 --> 23:18.040
 to somebody, you don't yet know their difficulties.

23:18.400 --> 23:22.200
 So you're seeing the most sparkling version of them.

23:22.200 --> 23:26.560
 You're seeing a platonic version of love and friendship.

23:26.560 --> 23:28.400
 And your imagination fills in the rest

23:28.400 --> 23:31.040
 in some beautiful way that matches perfectly

23:31.040 --> 23:33.000
 the kind of thing you're interested in.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
 That's how I feel about one spoonful of ice cream,

23:37.000 --> 23:39.880
 and that's why you always finish the whole tub,

23:39.880 --> 23:41.360
 and then you regret all of it.

23:42.400 --> 23:45.400
 You do cite, where did you write this?

23:45.400 --> 23:47.000
 I think this is on your website,

23:47.000 --> 23:48.560
 that one of the best things in the world

23:48.560 --> 23:52.160
 is that sublime moment when a writer, artist, or musician

23:52.160 --> 23:54.960
 manages to express something you've always felt,

23:54.960 --> 23:58.480
 but never articulated, or at least never quite so beautifully.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.320
 So that's the Oscar Wilde line is one line like that,

24:01.320 --> 24:06.320
 but just a line from a song or maybe a piece of art

24:06.760 --> 24:07.600
 that just grabs you.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.960
 Is there something that jumps out into memory

24:09.960 --> 24:11.840
 like that for you?

24:11.840 --> 24:14.040
 I don't know if I have an exact line, though.

24:14.040 --> 24:16.000
 I mean, that feeling that you just quoted

24:16.000 --> 24:17.480
 happens to me all the time.

24:17.480 --> 24:19.960
 I'm just bad at recalling exact instances, but.

24:19.960 --> 24:22.760
 Yeah, me too, on the spot.

24:22.760 --> 24:25.040
 But the writer Alain de Botton

24:25.040 --> 24:27.520
 regularly makes me feel that way.

24:27.520 --> 24:29.980
 He's just this beautiful essayist

24:29.980 --> 24:31.920
 and observer of human nature,

24:31.920 --> 24:34.160
 and he's just constantly expressing things

24:34.160 --> 24:37.600
 in this gorgeous way that you've experienced yourself.

24:37.600 --> 24:39.720
 And you feel like, I don't know,

24:39.720 --> 24:41.840
 it's just this grand act of generosity.

24:41.840 --> 24:43.120
 You feel less lonely.

24:43.120 --> 24:45.600
 You feel this deep sense of communion.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.320
 It's such an elevating experience.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.680
 Even when it's like a melancholy line.

24:50.520 --> 24:52.280
 Maybe especially when it is.

24:52.280 --> 24:53.280
 Yeah, what is that?

24:56.880 --> 24:59.240
 So the Jack Kerouac on the road

24:59.240 --> 25:01.200
 definitely makes me feel that way,

25:01.200 --> 25:05.760
 like every other line in there, forlorn rags of growing old.

25:05.760 --> 25:06.900
 Do you know, I never read that book.

25:06.900 --> 25:09.120
 So what was it about that book

25:09.120 --> 25:11.040
 that made you feel that way?

25:11.040 --> 25:13.440
 Well, okay, well, since you asked.

25:13.440 --> 25:14.440
 I do, I do. I'm going to linger.

25:14.440 --> 25:16.080
 I'm going to linger on this.

25:17.560 --> 25:21.320
 So this story is kind of the book,

25:21.320 --> 25:24.920
 the kind of defining book of the Beats,

25:24.920 --> 25:26.400
 of the Beats generation.

25:26.400 --> 25:29.440
 And it's basically a story of a writer

25:29.440 --> 25:32.840
 who takes a road trip across the United States

25:32.840 --> 25:37.060
 a couple of times and experiences a few close friends

25:37.060 --> 25:39.220
 and a few strangers along the way.

25:39.220 --> 25:42.080
 And there's a lot of just those melancholy goodbyes

25:42.080 --> 25:43.240
 along the way.

25:43.240 --> 25:46.120
 You meet all these people with interesting lives.

25:46.120 --> 25:47.640
 Some of them are defined by struggle.

25:47.640 --> 25:50.720
 Some of them are defined by drugs, drinking, women,

25:50.720 --> 25:52.120
 all that kind of stuff.

25:52.120 --> 25:55.160
 And still he just kind of dances around all of that

25:55.160 --> 25:58.960
 and is defined by the goodbyes and the passing of time.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.920
 So a lot of the really powerful lines are basically like,

26:03.440 --> 26:05.600
 there's one on there, again, I don't remember exactly,

26:05.600 --> 26:10.600
 but he meets a beautiful girl at a rest stop.

26:10.960 --> 26:14.680
 And the girl is getting,

26:14.680 --> 26:17.160
 or a woman is getting on a different bus

26:17.160 --> 26:18.520
 than he's getting on.

26:18.520 --> 26:23.520
 And it's that feeling of falling in love for a second

26:23.520 --> 26:28.520
 and realizing that fate is just ripping that out,

26:28.520 --> 26:33.520
 which is similar to this idea of it sucks to say goodbye

26:33.520 --> 26:35.200
 just when you met, but it's especially true

26:35.200 --> 26:37.600
 when you fall in love just a little bit with that stranger

26:37.600 --> 26:41.600
 with all the possibilities that could lay there.

26:41.600 --> 26:45.800
 So there's a few lines of written down.

26:45.800 --> 26:47.560
 I went down this whole rabbit hole of thinking,

26:47.560 --> 26:49.840
 what are the lines that grabbed me?

26:49.840 --> 26:51.960
 A couple of lines from on the road trip.

26:51.960 --> 26:53.760
 A couple of lines from on the road.

26:53.760 --> 26:56.120
 So one is, what is that feeling

26:56.120 --> 26:58.200
 when you're driving away from people

26:58.200 --> 26:59.560
 and they recede on the plane

26:59.560 --> 27:01.920
 till you see their specks dispersing?

27:01.920 --> 27:05.240
 It's the two huge world vaulting us and it's goodbye,

27:05.240 --> 27:07.440
 but we lean forward to the next crazy venture

27:07.440 --> 27:08.600
 beneath the skies.

27:08.600 --> 27:11.560
 So this is him talking about leaving a particular city.

27:11.560 --> 27:14.680
 The spoiler alert towards the end of the book,

27:14.680 --> 27:18.120
 rather the end of the book line I return to often,

27:18.120 --> 27:21.480
 it's more poetry, but it's a feeling

27:21.480 --> 27:23.280
 that captures the book I would say.

27:25.120 --> 27:27.360
 The evening star must be drooping

27:27.360 --> 27:30.640
 and shedding her sparkler dims on the prairie,

27:30.640 --> 27:32.760
 which is just before the coming of complete night

27:32.760 --> 27:36.040
 that blesses the earth, darkens all the rivers,

27:36.040 --> 27:38.840
 cups the peaks and folds the final shore in.

27:38.840 --> 27:42.640
 And nobody, nobody knows what's going to happen to anybody

27:42.640 --> 27:45.200
 besides the forlorn rags of growing old.

27:45.200 --> 27:49.640
 And it just captures this kind of

27:49.640 --> 27:53.720
 in the moment appreciation of the beauty of the world

27:53.720 --> 27:56.640
 and a sadness over the fact that time passes

27:56.640 --> 27:58.560
 and you leave the people you love behind,

27:58.560 --> 28:01.480
 you leave the places you love behind,

28:01.480 --> 28:03.320
 or at least the way they were

28:03.320 --> 28:04.800
 at the time that you really enjoyed them.

28:04.800 --> 28:06.520
 And you just leave that, all that,

28:06.520 --> 28:08.600
 just the sadness you feel when you,

28:08.600 --> 28:10.960
 something about it, like looking at a picture,

28:10.960 --> 28:12.760
 looking at your kids grow up,

28:12.760 --> 28:15.120
 looking at old friends getting old,

28:15.120 --> 28:18.440
 something makes you realize that time passes.

28:18.440 --> 28:19.840
 And somewhere deep in there

28:19.840 --> 28:22.160
 is probably a realization of your mortality.

28:22.160 --> 28:25.160
 And then it just makes you somehow first sad

28:25.160 --> 28:28.480
 that everything comes to an end.

28:28.480 --> 28:33.280
 And then that's immediately followed

28:33.280 --> 28:35.120
 by sort of an appreciation of the moment,

28:35.120 --> 28:37.760
 like a gratitude that you get to experience this moment.

28:37.760 --> 28:39.120
 Yeah, I know it exactly.

28:39.120 --> 28:42.400
 I mean, that's the whole reason that I wrote Bitter Sweet.

28:42.400 --> 28:43.360
 It's all about that.

28:43.360 --> 28:46.760
 And so I know intensely what you're talking about.

28:46.760 --> 28:49.040
 And by the way, my husband loves the book

28:49.040 --> 28:51.000
 A Movable Feast by Ernest Hemingway,

28:51.000 --> 28:52.120
 which I also haven't read,

28:52.120 --> 28:54.120
 but it talks about that same thing,

28:54.120 --> 28:56.600
 groups of people traveling around together

28:56.600 --> 29:00.280
 and the group coalesces into some magical formation.

29:00.280 --> 29:01.760
 And then one person leaves the group

29:01.760 --> 29:03.800
 and it's never gonna be the same again.

29:03.800 --> 29:06.240
 And then they move on to the next one.

29:06.240 --> 29:09.840
 Yeah, I mean, I think that's the deepest essence

29:09.840 --> 29:14.840
 of human nature, the feeling of longing

29:15.840 --> 29:20.360
 for some kind of state of perfect completeness, completion,

29:20.360 --> 29:23.920
 perfect love, the Garden of Eden, all of it.

29:23.920 --> 29:28.000
 And the feeling that you're never gonna quite attain it,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.200
 but you get glimpses of it here and there.

29:30.200 --> 29:32.280
 And that those glimpses are some of the best things

29:32.280 --> 29:33.440
 that ever happened to us.

29:33.440 --> 29:34.960
 And they're suffused with sadness

29:34.960 --> 29:36.680
 because they're not the real thing

29:36.680 --> 29:37.840
 or they're not the full thing.

29:37.840 --> 29:39.560
 They're just a glimpse.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.320
 It's a glimpse of what we long for.

29:42.280 --> 29:45.080
 So the sadness that we might feel

29:47.000 --> 29:50.040
 is always connected to the ways in which we fall short

29:50.040 --> 29:52.400
 from the perfect thing that we're,

29:52.400 --> 29:54.800
 like there's always a thing you're longing for.

29:55.920 --> 29:59.680
 And the sadness has to do with getting a glimpse of it,

29:59.680 --> 30:01.840
 but not quite getting a hold of it.

30:01.840 --> 30:03.160
 Yeah, yeah.

30:03.160 --> 30:04.880
 So it's always losing.

30:04.880 --> 30:07.360
 It's always losing, but it's also always,

30:07.360 --> 30:09.320
 but it's not, that sounds really depressing,

30:09.320 --> 30:11.760
 but it's not, you know it's not depressing

30:11.760 --> 30:13.200
 because you experience this all the time.

30:13.200 --> 30:16.560
 It's also, those are the most beautiful moments

30:16.560 --> 30:18.400
 I think life offers.

30:18.400 --> 30:21.520
 I mean, it's intense, intense beauty in those moments

30:22.400 --> 30:25.000
 because it's getting closer to the real thing

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
 that we long for.

30:26.880 --> 30:31.440
 So what about like loss, losing love?

30:31.440 --> 30:36.440
 Is that also a beautiful thing?

30:36.440 --> 30:40.440
 Well, the moments you're talking about,

30:40.440 --> 30:44.480
 I think it's easier to appreciate the beauty of it all

30:44.480 --> 30:48.040
 in the moment because you're experiencing,

30:49.080 --> 30:51.080
 you're kind of experiencing the loss and the love

30:51.080 --> 30:52.360
 all at the same time.

30:53.360 --> 30:55.480
 Whereas if you're talking about straight up loss,

30:55.480 --> 31:00.160
 like a betrayal or a bereavement or whatever it is,

31:00.160 --> 31:03.720
 that's, it's different, it's quite overwhelming.

31:03.720 --> 31:05.680
 So losing a loved one kind of thing.

31:05.680 --> 31:06.680
 Losing a loved one.

31:06.680 --> 31:11.200
 I mean, I will say that the truth that I think

31:11.200 --> 31:15.560
 that we can come to after a lot of time on this earth

31:15.560 --> 31:20.560
 is the idea that love exists not only in its particular

31:20.560 --> 31:25.560
 forms, so not only in the form of the one person,

31:25.560 --> 31:28.400
 that one person we love or that other person we love,

31:28.400 --> 31:32.040
 but love itself is a state that we have access to.

31:32.040 --> 31:37.040
 And so over time, the loss of person A can heal

31:37.520 --> 31:42.520
 and you can tap into a kind of bigger river of love.

31:42.520 --> 31:46.560
 Yeah, I mean, I had this, it comes from Louis C.K.

31:46.560 --> 31:49.400
 in a show, damn I love that line.

31:49.400 --> 31:52.200
 I mean, there's a, he talks to an older gentleman

31:53.600 --> 31:58.600
 and Louis is all like sad about losing a loved one

31:58.600 --> 32:03.600
 or like getting rejected essentially, like a breakup.

32:05.600 --> 32:09.080
 And then the older gentleman gives him advice saying,

32:09.080 --> 32:13.360
 like basically criticizes Louis for saying,

32:13.360 --> 32:15.240
 why are you moping around?

32:15.240 --> 32:18.000
 Because this is the most, this is the best part.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.480
 Like losing love is the best part because that's,

32:21.480 --> 32:23.460
 the real loss is when you forget.

32:23.460 --> 32:28.160
 Like feeling shitty about having gone through a breakup

32:29.740 --> 32:32.860
 is when you most intensely appreciate

32:32.860 --> 32:34.380
 what that person meant to you.

32:35.620 --> 32:40.340
 Like you most intensely feel love in some strange way

32:40.340 --> 32:43.360
 by realizing that you've lost it, by missing it,

32:43.360 --> 32:46.660
 wishing at this moment, I wish I had that.

32:46.660 --> 32:50.820
 Like that feeling, that's when you feel that love the most,

32:50.820 --> 32:54.300
 the absence of it, and so the older gentleman

32:54.300 --> 32:56.980
 gives advice that that's the best part.

32:56.980 --> 32:58.740
 And it can, if you're good with it,

32:58.740 --> 33:00.140
 it can last for the longest.

33:01.400 --> 33:05.540
 It could be the most sort of prolonged experience

33:05.540 --> 33:09.400
 of deep appreciation and emotion and so on.

33:09.400 --> 33:14.140
 So that's kind of a, that's a nice way to look at loss,

33:14.900 --> 33:18.540
 which is a reminder of how much somebody meant to us.

33:18.540 --> 33:22.140
 Yeah, I mean, I think there's a lot of truth in that

33:23.680 --> 33:26.180
 because yeah, you wouldn't care so much

33:26.180 --> 33:27.700
 if it weren't something that mattered to you.

33:27.700 --> 33:30.260
 So it's always a signpost to the direction

33:30.260 --> 33:31.540
 you really wanna go to.

33:32.420 --> 33:33.620
 That's always what it is.

33:34.880 --> 33:37.140
 Yeah, and it's interesting to see the way

33:37.140 --> 33:42.140
 that the mystical versions of many of the great religions

33:43.620 --> 33:45.700
 all point in this direction.

33:45.700 --> 33:49.100
 Whether you're looking at Sufism or the Kabbalah

33:49.100 --> 33:51.760
 or in Christian mysticism, you see this idea

33:51.760 --> 33:56.000
 that the longing for what you lack is the very thing

33:56.000 --> 33:58.340
 that gives you what you're longing for.

33:58.340 --> 33:59.820
 So the longing is the cure.

33:59.820 --> 34:02.820
 I mean, that's the way the Sufi poet Rumi puts it.

34:02.820 --> 34:04.780
 The longing is the cure.

34:04.780 --> 34:05.860
 And he says, be thirsty.

34:05.860 --> 34:08.500
 Like be as thirsty as you possibly can.

34:08.500 --> 34:09.940
 That's what you wanna be.

34:09.940 --> 34:12.360
 The good stuff is the wanting, not the having.

34:12.360 --> 34:16.800
 Yeah, yeah, of course, tell that to a person

34:16.800 --> 34:18.440
 that just broke up and they'll be like,

34:18.440 --> 34:21.640
 shut up, asshole, advice sucks.

34:21.640 --> 34:24.760
 I wish I had her and back.

34:24.760 --> 34:26.300
 Yeah, no, absolutely.

34:26.300 --> 34:29.680
 Those are the kinds of life lessons that only work

34:29.680 --> 34:31.600
 when you kind of step away for a while.

34:31.600 --> 34:35.280
 They don't work in the moment of excruciation.

34:35.280 --> 34:39.200
 There is something about the fact of knowing

34:39.200 --> 34:42.480
 that all humans are in that experience together

34:42.480 --> 34:45.580
 that is also incredibly uplifting.

34:46.700 --> 34:49.540
 Well, that takes time for people to realize.

34:49.540 --> 34:54.360
 Like heartbreak in your early teenage years

34:54.360 --> 34:57.380
 or something like that could feel like this is completely

34:57.380 --> 35:02.380
 the most novel and the most dramatic pain

35:02.380 --> 35:04.840
 that any human has ever felt, right?

35:04.840 --> 35:07.000
 Or maybe even when you're younger.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.600
 And then one of the things you realize

35:10.600 --> 35:13.020
 is that everybody goes through this.

35:13.020 --> 35:14.920
 That can be an awakening to the fact

35:14.920 --> 35:16.480
 that we're all in this together.

35:16.480 --> 35:19.760
 This human condition is not just a personal experience.

35:19.760 --> 35:21.560
 It's an experience we all share.

35:21.560 --> 35:25.000
 And that's a kind of love, the unity of it.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.600
 Yeah, that's a really deep kind of love.

35:27.600 --> 35:32.600
 And I feel like we are prevented from perceiving that love

35:33.560 --> 35:36.280
 as it's actually like the most obvious kind of love

35:36.280 --> 35:38.480
 and it's right there and it happens all the time.

35:38.480 --> 35:40.160
 But we're prevented from perceiving it

35:40.160 --> 35:41.620
 because we're not really supposed to talk

35:41.620 --> 35:42.660
 about things like that.

35:42.660 --> 35:45.360
 It's like there's something unseemly about it.

35:45.360 --> 35:49.040
 Well, it's also in the West is this individualist society.

35:49.040 --> 35:53.880
 So like there's a pressure to sort of see the individual

35:53.880 --> 35:58.880
 as a distinct sovereign entity that experiences things.

35:59.560 --> 36:03.160
 The unity between people is not obviously sort of

36:03.160 --> 36:06.580
 communicated or talked about as part of the culture.

36:06.580 --> 36:08.080
 Yeah, it's not part of the culture.

36:08.080 --> 36:12.360
 And yet, you see it in our behaviors because we're humans.

36:12.360 --> 36:15.480
 So, why do people listen to sad music?

36:15.480 --> 36:19.120
 I mean, one reason is they're hearing expressed for them.

36:19.120 --> 36:21.460
 Like the musician is basically saying to them,

36:21.460 --> 36:24.720
 this thing that you have experienced,

36:24.720 --> 36:28.440
 I've experienced it too, so have lots of other people.

36:28.440 --> 36:29.720
 But they're saying it all without words

36:29.720 --> 36:33.000
 and it's transformed into something beautiful.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.360
 And there's something about that

36:34.360 --> 36:37.460
 that's just incredibly elevating.

36:37.460 --> 36:38.440
 And people don't know it,

36:38.440 --> 36:43.240
 but like there's one study that I have in Bittersweet

36:43.240 --> 36:45.960
 that found that people whose favorite songs

36:45.960 --> 36:48.280
 are their happy songs, play it on their playlist

36:48.280 --> 36:51.500
 about 175 times, but the people who love sad music

36:51.500 --> 36:53.300
 play them about 800 times.

36:55.300 --> 36:58.520
 And they say that they feel connected to the sublime

36:58.520 --> 37:00.840
 when they're listening to that music.

37:00.840 --> 37:03.280
 What do you think that is?

37:03.280 --> 37:08.180
 So, what is it in music that connects us

37:08.180 --> 37:10.680
 to the sublime through sadness?

37:11.840 --> 37:13.960
 I mean, I have a bunch of different theories.

37:13.960 --> 37:18.960
 Like the whole reason I started writing this book

37:19.280 --> 37:22.480
 is because I kept having this reaction reliably

37:22.480 --> 37:24.440
 to sad music.

37:24.440 --> 37:27.580
 And I realized that for people who I knew

37:27.580 --> 37:29.160
 who were religious believers,

37:29.160 --> 37:32.040
 the way they described their experience of God

37:32.040 --> 37:35.320
 was what I was experiencing when I would hear that music.

37:36.920 --> 37:38.080
 Like all the time.

37:38.080 --> 37:39.680
 It happens over and over again.

37:39.680 --> 37:42.280
 So, you wonder what that is?

37:42.280 --> 37:44.600
 Yeah, so I started wondering what that is.

37:44.600 --> 37:48.320
 And lots of people have tried to figure out

37:48.320 --> 37:49.400
 what that's all about.

37:51.160 --> 37:53.560
 And there are different theories that it's expressing,

37:53.560 --> 37:57.460
 it's like a kind of catharsis for our difficult emotions,

37:57.460 --> 38:01.220
 that it's, as we were saying, a sense of being in it together.

38:02.860 --> 38:06.160
 We don't react in that sort of uplifted way

38:06.160 --> 38:10.160
 when you just see like a slideshow of sad faces,

38:10.160 --> 38:12.640
 which is something researchers have actually tested.

38:12.640 --> 38:15.360
 No one really cares when they're seeing the sad faces.

38:15.360 --> 38:17.440
 But the sad music, they're really reacting.

38:17.440 --> 38:18.920
 And also, they don't really react

38:18.920 --> 38:20.520
 when they're hearing music expressing

38:20.520 --> 38:21.940
 other negative emotions,

38:21.940 --> 38:24.000
 like Marshall music or something like that.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.680
 It's just the sad music that gives people

38:25.680 --> 38:28.320
 this elevated sense of wonder.

38:28.320 --> 38:31.680
 So, I think it's the combination of the sadness

38:31.680 --> 38:33.320
 and the beauty.

38:33.320 --> 38:37.480
 And I think it's just tapping into the essence

38:37.480 --> 38:38.800
 of the human source code,

38:38.800 --> 38:40.920
 which is a kind of spiritual longing,

38:40.920 --> 38:43.340
 whether we're atheists or believers.

38:43.340 --> 38:46.680
 There's this feeling of longing for a state

38:46.680 --> 38:49.560
 and a place of perfect love and perfect unity

38:49.560 --> 38:51.680
 and perfect truth and all of it.

38:51.680 --> 38:54.240
 And like an acute awareness that we're not there

38:54.240 --> 38:56.160
 in this world.

38:56.160 --> 38:58.240
 In religions, we express that through the longing

38:58.240 --> 39:01.440
 for Mecca or Eden or Zion.

39:02.680 --> 39:05.320
 And artistically, we express it with

39:05.320 --> 39:07.680
 Dorothy longing for somewhere over the rainbow

39:07.680 --> 39:12.040
 or Harry Potter enters the story at the precise moment

39:12.040 --> 39:13.920
 that he's become an orphan.

39:14.760 --> 39:16.840
 So, he's now gonna spend the rest of his life

39:16.840 --> 39:19.800
 longing for these parents who he can never remember.

39:19.800 --> 39:23.400
 And there's something about that state

39:23.400 --> 39:24.840
 that's at our very core.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.800
 And I think that's why we love it so much.

39:26.800 --> 39:28.440
 Well, it could be, you know, you could have

39:28.440 --> 39:31.360
 the Ernest Becker theory of denial of death,

39:31.360 --> 39:35.160
 where at the core of that, the warm at the core,

39:35.160 --> 39:38.020
 as Jung said, is the fear of death.

39:38.020 --> 39:42.040
 So, where the longing for the perfect thing

39:42.040 --> 39:46.040
 has to do with sort of becoming immortal,

39:46.040 --> 39:51.040
 is reaching beyond the absurdity, the cruelty of life,

39:53.720 --> 39:56.120
 that all things come to an end

39:56.120 --> 40:01.120
 for no particularly good reason whatsoever.

40:01.280 --> 40:03.240
 One we can rationally explain.

40:03.240 --> 40:05.960
 I know, you know, I wonder about that all the time.

40:05.960 --> 40:09.840
 Like, I know obviously there's that idea from Becker

40:09.840 --> 40:12.360
 and throughout philosophy and the tale of Gilgamesh

40:12.360 --> 40:14.400
 about the idea that the thing we're longing for

40:14.400 --> 40:17.000
 most of all is immortality.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.320
 But I feel like it's not only that.

40:20.320 --> 40:25.320
 I think it's more so or also, let's say,

40:26.200 --> 40:30.840
 a longing for the lions to lay down with the lambs finally.

40:30.840 --> 40:34.480
 You know, for like the fundamental calculus of the universe

40:34.480 --> 40:37.520
 to just be different, where life doesn't have to eat life

40:37.520 --> 40:38.760
 in order to survive.

40:38.760 --> 40:42.100
 And yeah, just a completely different situation.

40:42.100 --> 40:42.940
 I wonder.

40:42.940 --> 40:45.600
 What immortality would not solve?

40:45.600 --> 40:46.840
 I wonder.

40:46.840 --> 40:49.840
 That could be a very kind of modern thing,

40:53.280 --> 40:56.000
 because surely so much of human history

40:56.000 --> 40:59.160
 is defined by violence and glorified violence

40:59.160 --> 41:02.540
 that doesn't give inklings of this lions and the lambs.

41:03.560 --> 41:04.400
 So much of.

41:04.400 --> 41:06.980
 It's in the Bible.

41:06.980 --> 41:09.080
 I mean, I know all the other stuff is in the Bible too.

41:09.080 --> 41:10.400
 There's other stuff in the Bible,

41:10.400 --> 41:12.760
 and the Bible, that particular aspect

41:12.760 --> 41:15.920
 doesn't necessarily reveal the fundamental motivation

41:15.920 --> 41:17.240
 of human nature.

41:17.240 --> 41:19.780
 That could be deeper stuff, you know?

41:19.780 --> 41:23.400
 But yeah, that is a beautiful picture,

41:23.400 --> 41:28.400
 but is it just about humans or is it all about all of life?

41:28.440 --> 41:33.440
 And you have to think about what does the perfect world

41:33.960 --> 41:34.800
 look like?

41:34.800 --> 41:37.960
 It's not just the lions and the lambs laying together.

41:37.960 --> 41:41.400
 It's, you know, how many lions and how many lambs?

41:41.400 --> 41:46.400
 And, you know, what, having just had a few

41:46.760 --> 41:49.840
 very technical conversations about Marxian economics

41:49.840 --> 41:53.560
 versus Keynesian economics versus neoclassical economics,

41:53.560 --> 41:55.600
 what does the economic and the government system

41:55.600 --> 41:57.640
 look like for the lions and the lambs

41:57.640 --> 41:59.200
 that we're longing for?

41:59.200 --> 42:01.400
 So then you start to build society

42:01.400 --> 42:04.420
 on top of all those things, but you still,

42:04.420 --> 42:08.340
 you return to this, what are we longing for?

42:08.340 --> 42:10.000
 And what's the role of love in that?

42:10.000 --> 42:13.520
 What's the role of that sad melancholy feeling,

42:13.520 --> 42:14.800
 the feeling of loneliness?

42:14.800 --> 42:17.400
 Is the feeling of loneliness fundamental

42:17.400 --> 42:18.600
 to the human condition?

42:18.600 --> 42:22.760
 Like, are we always striving to sort of channel

42:22.760 --> 42:27.120
 that feeling of loneliness to connect with others?

42:27.120 --> 42:28.720
 Like, we want that feeling of loneliness,

42:28.720 --> 42:30.640
 otherwise we wouldn't be connecting.

42:30.640 --> 42:35.200
 Is that fundamental, that feeling like you're alone in this

42:35.200 --> 42:37.640
 even when you're with other people, sort of alone together?

42:37.640 --> 42:39.640
 You're born alone, you die alone.

42:39.640 --> 42:41.280
 Maybe loneliness is fundamental.

42:41.280 --> 42:44.440
 I think the longing for union is fundamental.

42:44.440 --> 42:47.600
 It's just that it looks so different for different people.

42:47.600 --> 42:49.080
 Right, yeah.

42:49.080 --> 42:51.560
 And coming back to what we were talking about

42:51.560 --> 42:55.100
 at the beginning, union looks incredibly social

42:55.100 --> 42:58.360
 for a lot of people and hardly social at all for others,

42:58.360 --> 43:01.280
 but everybody needs some version of union.

43:01.280 --> 43:02.940
 Yeah, people have been telling me recently

43:02.940 --> 43:04.800
 about polyamory and all those kinds of things.

43:04.800 --> 43:08.240
 So having probably grown up in a certain part of the world,

43:08.240 --> 43:12.880
 I'm very, I think I'm very monogamy centric,

43:12.880 --> 43:14.600
 not in a judgmental way, just for me,

43:14.600 --> 43:16.000
 what makes me happy is one person.

43:16.000 --> 43:20.880
 So for my whole life, basically just dedication.

43:20.880 --> 43:23.520
 Because I've just seen through relationships

43:23.520 --> 43:26.400
 with people and objects in my life,

43:27.680 --> 43:31.700
 the longer we stay together, the deeper the tie.

43:32.720 --> 43:36.260
 So that's just the empirical thing.

43:36.260 --> 43:40.200
 And yes, that probably is a personalized thing.

43:40.200 --> 43:41.200
 That's just true for me.

43:41.200 --> 43:43.100
 It could be very different for others.

43:43.100 --> 43:46.560
 Maybe it's connected to the introverted thing, maybe not.

43:49.040 --> 43:49.880
 Who knows?

43:49.880 --> 43:53.360
 Before I leave, because you mentioned songs, sad songs.

43:53.360 --> 43:55.100
 What are we talking about?

43:55.100 --> 43:59.460
 What's a good, what song do you remember last crying to?

43:59.460 --> 44:07.320
 Oh gosh, well, I mean, I literally dedicated my book

44:07.320 --> 44:08.160
 to Leonard Cohen.

44:08.160 --> 44:10.680
 He's played such a huge role in my life.

44:10.680 --> 44:11.640
 I love him.

44:11.640 --> 44:12.480
 I love him.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.840
 And I've loved him with this crazy love

44:15.840 --> 44:19.040
 that I've never been able to understand for decades.

44:19.040 --> 44:21.940
 I think I understand it a little better now, but.

44:21.940 --> 44:25.120
 So you're better friends with him than me, I'm jealous.

44:25.120 --> 44:30.360
 So does it make you, is it the musician or the human too?

44:30.360 --> 44:34.380
 Because the human is a tortuous soul in a way.

44:34.380 --> 44:36.340
 I'd say it's the musician.

44:36.340 --> 44:37.180
 It's the musician.

44:37.180 --> 44:38.680
 And I actually was thinking about this the other day.

44:38.680 --> 44:41.160
 I mean, obviously he's not alive anymore,

44:41.160 --> 44:44.020
 but I was kind of running the thought experiment.

44:44.020 --> 44:46.660
 If he were alive still and I had the chance

44:46.660 --> 44:49.940
 to meet him in person, would I wanna do that?

44:50.880 --> 44:53.200
 And I'm not really sure that I would

44:53.200 --> 44:58.200
 because he represents for me symbolically everything,

45:01.120 --> 45:04.200
 well, everything, I'll end the sentence right there.

45:04.200 --> 45:06.600
 And so, and I think that's okay.

45:06.600 --> 45:10.080
 I think people can express something through their art

45:10.080 --> 45:12.260
 that they might or might not express

45:12.260 --> 45:15.680
 if you were just hanging out with them and having a coffee.

45:15.680 --> 45:17.600
 And I'm happy to know him that way.

45:17.600 --> 45:19.640
 He can express himself, I'm sure,

45:19.640 --> 45:23.480
 in the way that you know him as over coffee too.

45:23.480 --> 45:28.480
 It just requires like a focus of remembering,

45:30.440 --> 45:31.960
 of like a deep focus of connection.

45:31.960 --> 45:35.560
 That's why like when I interact with folks,

45:38.120 --> 45:42.400
 it's so draining for me because I'm putting all my,

45:42.400 --> 45:45.960
 whatever weapons I got in terms of like deeply

45:45.960 --> 45:48.480
 trying to understand the person in front of me

45:48.480 --> 45:50.560
 and doing that dance of human interaction,

45:50.560 --> 45:55.560
 the humor, the intense kind of delving into who they are.

45:57.400 --> 46:00.960
 Which requires like navigating around

46:00.960 --> 46:02.560
 like small talk type of stuff

46:02.560 --> 46:05.560
 and just like compliments and so on.

46:05.560 --> 46:07.880
 In general, like people, depending on the culture,

46:07.880 --> 46:10.640
 depending on the place, they'll sometimes flower stuff

46:10.640 --> 46:12.520
 with smiling and like compliments like,

46:12.520 --> 46:15.080
 oh, yeah, I love you, this is great.

46:15.080 --> 46:17.280
 I guess that's all great, but you wanna get to the core

46:17.280 --> 46:20.640
 of like, what are the demons in the closet?

46:20.640 --> 46:22.320
 Let's talk about it.

46:22.320 --> 46:24.560
 And that can be exhausting.

46:24.560 --> 46:25.740
 That can be really exhausting.

46:25.740 --> 46:27.160
 So from a Leonard Cohen perspective,

46:27.160 --> 46:29.360
 you get more and more famous.

46:29.360 --> 46:31.120
 It can be hard sometimes

46:31.120 --> 46:33.540
 because he probably is also an introvert.

46:33.540 --> 46:34.380
 I'm guessing.

46:34.380 --> 46:35.440
 Oh, yeah, I know he was an introvert

46:35.440 --> 46:39.300
 because he actually tweeted about my book when it came out.

46:39.300 --> 46:41.080
 So that was a precious moment for me.

46:41.080 --> 46:43.120
 Something that we should all be listening to the quiet.

46:43.120 --> 46:45.840
 I can't remember exactly what he said.

46:45.840 --> 46:48.680
 But yeah, yeah, no, he definitely was.

46:48.680 --> 46:50.960
 He struggled with depression,

46:50.960 --> 46:53.320
 which I wonder if that's something

46:53.320 --> 46:55.400
 that's also connected to introversion.

46:56.840 --> 46:58.160
 Well, perhaps not actually.

46:58.160 --> 47:00.360
 Perhaps they're very disjoint and also.

47:00.360 --> 47:01.800
 It's connected to sensitivity

47:01.800 --> 47:04.040
 and many sensitive people are introverts.

47:04.040 --> 47:06.360
 So it's kind of like a Venn diagram.

47:06.360 --> 47:09.360
 About 80% of highly sensitive people are introverted,

47:09.360 --> 47:11.080
 but then some are extroverts.

47:11.080 --> 47:13.280
 And then not all introverts are sensitive.

47:13.280 --> 47:14.720
 So it's complicated.

47:14.720 --> 47:17.200
 But he was definitely a sensitive type.

47:17.200 --> 47:18.240
 Well, there's on top of that,

47:18.240 --> 47:21.520
 you see like the percent of artists

47:21.520 --> 47:23.620
 relative to the average that suffer from depression.

47:23.620 --> 47:26.180
 So creative people is very high.

47:26.180 --> 47:27.400
 Very, very high. It's crazy.

47:27.400 --> 47:29.120
 Yeah, and then the number of artists

47:29.120 --> 47:31.820
 and successful artists who were orphaned

47:31.820 --> 47:32.660
 when they were young,

47:32.660 --> 47:34.520
 who lost one parent or both parents,

47:34.520 --> 47:36.080
 it's like an astronomical number.

47:36.080 --> 47:37.240
 I have it in the book.

47:37.240 --> 47:39.440
 I don't remember the percentage, but huge.

47:39.440 --> 47:40.360
 And he was one of them.

47:40.360 --> 47:43.040
 He lost his father when he was nine.

47:43.040 --> 47:47.440
 And his first act of poetry was he took,

47:47.440 --> 47:49.160
 his father made suits.

47:49.160 --> 47:50.040
 That's why I thought of him

47:50.040 --> 47:51.960
 when we were talking about you in your suit.

47:51.960 --> 47:54.680
 And he took one of his father's bow ties

47:54.680 --> 47:57.240
 and wrote a poem in his honor

47:57.240 --> 48:01.440
 and buried the poem and the bow tie in the backyard.

48:01.440 --> 48:04.240
 And that was like his first creative act.

48:04.240 --> 48:07.120
 You know that song, Chelsea Hotel No. 2?

48:07.120 --> 48:07.960
 Sure.

48:07.960 --> 48:10.320
 Where he met, I guess it's about Janis Joplin.

48:10.320 --> 48:13.080
 Joplin, yeah.

48:13.080 --> 48:18.080
 What a fun, intense, and cruel person she is.

48:18.160 --> 48:19.000
 Yeah.

48:20.080 --> 48:22.000
 So I guess.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.020
 Have you ever seen, I'm sorry to interrupt you,

48:24.020 --> 48:26.560
 but have you ever seen his son Adam Cohn

48:26.560 --> 48:29.040
 and Lana Del Rey perform that song together?

48:29.040 --> 48:29.880
 Oh wow, no.

48:29.880 --> 48:30.960
 It's incredible.

48:30.960 --> 48:31.960
 I have to send it to you.

48:31.960 --> 48:32.800
 Yeah.

48:32.800 --> 48:34.280
 So that for people who don't know,

48:34.280 --> 48:36.680
 I don't, I mean, maybe I don't know.

48:36.680 --> 48:39.400
 It goes, I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel.

48:39.400 --> 48:42.600
 You're talking so brave and so sweet.

48:42.600 --> 48:46.160
 Giving me head on the unmade bed

48:46.160 --> 48:48.400
 while the limousines wait in the street.

48:48.400 --> 48:53.400
 There's a good line in there about being ugly.

48:53.920 --> 48:56.560
 Oh yeah, we are ugly, but we have the music.

48:56.560 --> 48:59.880
 No, before that, from a guy's perspective, it was.

48:59.880 --> 49:03.240
 Oh, you told me again you preferred handsome men.

49:03.240 --> 49:05.160
 But for me, you would make an exception.

49:05.160 --> 49:07.160
 Yeah, so good.

49:07.160 --> 49:09.960
 Well, she continued that thread in later

49:09.960 --> 49:13.600
 because I think she said that he was lousy in bed.

49:13.600 --> 49:14.440
 Oh, is that right?

49:14.440 --> 49:16.200
 Yeah, she publicly said that.

49:16.200 --> 49:18.540
 Which is like, oh man, did there.

49:20.540 --> 49:23.040
 Just, okay, for people who don't know,

49:23.040 --> 49:26.280
 I think this is a true story about them interacting

49:26.280 --> 49:29.600
 and being together for a very brief time.

49:29.600 --> 49:31.200
 I don't know, dating, but just connecting.

49:31.200 --> 49:35.580
 Falling in love or in this very particular way

49:35.580 --> 49:39.440
 that I think famous musicians, poets can,

49:39.440 --> 49:40.640
 which is like, it's impossible

49:40.640 --> 49:42.800
 for that kind of thing to last.

49:42.800 --> 49:47.040
 But they did for a brief moment.

49:47.040 --> 49:51.240
 There's like a sadness to it because it's so momentarily,

49:52.200 --> 49:55.960
 but it's so epic that these two paths cross

49:55.960 --> 49:58.520
 and then you just look at it, we know these famous people

49:58.520 --> 50:01.100
 and it's interesting to watch.

50:01.100 --> 50:02.480
 Yeah, and you don't even have the impression

50:02.480 --> 50:04.400
 that they're thinking it's gonna last.

50:04.400 --> 50:07.560
 They more know that it's like a blaze of an intersection

50:07.560 --> 50:09.700
 and the limousine's already waiting

50:09.700 --> 50:12.720
 while they're in the middle of it and then it's done.

50:14.520 --> 50:18.340
 Yeah, and he's talked about how his music,

50:19.200 --> 50:22.340
 he said something like, some people are more inclined

50:22.340 --> 50:23.800
 to say hello with their music,

50:23.800 --> 50:26.760
 but I'm rather more valedictory.

50:26.760 --> 50:27.580
 That's what he said.

50:27.580 --> 50:28.420
 What does valedictory mean?

50:28.420 --> 50:31.180
 Like saying goodbye, like the valedictorian's address.

50:31.180 --> 50:33.500
 Interesting.

50:33.500 --> 50:36.380
 You know, so many of his songs really are

50:36.380 --> 50:40.020
 about some form of parting or goodbye

50:40.020 --> 50:41.980
 or an imperfection or something,

50:41.980 --> 50:43.620
 or like the broken hallelujah.

50:45.260 --> 50:46.100
 Yeah, that's songs.

50:46.100 --> 50:49.140
 But the thing that's so incredible about him

50:50.180 --> 50:54.740
 is the way that he's taking all of that

50:54.740 --> 50:57.620
 and pointing it in the direction of transcendence.

50:57.620 --> 51:00.860
 Like, it's not just pure sadness.

51:00.860 --> 51:03.960
 It's sadness and beauty, and that's the thing.

51:03.960 --> 51:05.700
 Yeah, there is a feeling of transcendence

51:05.700 --> 51:07.740
 in a lot of the songs.

51:07.740 --> 51:10.620
 It's like sadness and transcendence, you're right.

51:10.620 --> 51:15.620
 It's a goodbye, but you're moving on to some bigger thing,

51:17.180 --> 51:20.180
 but in a sort of ethereal way,

51:20.180 --> 51:23.460
 not like a proud, arrogant way.

51:23.460 --> 51:28.020
 Yeah, so his favorite poet was Garcia Lorca.

51:28.020 --> 51:30.060
 He actually named his daughter after him.

51:30.060 --> 51:31.460
 His daughter's name is Lorca.

51:31.460 --> 51:36.460
 And he talks about how there's some poem

51:37.060 --> 51:40.420
 that Lorca had written that made him realize

51:40.420 --> 51:44.180
 that the universe itself was aching,

51:44.180 --> 51:46.340
 but the ache was okay because that's the way

51:46.340 --> 51:48.280
 you embrace the sun and the moon.

51:48.280 --> 51:51.440
 And that's what I think is,

51:52.940 --> 51:55.940
 that's why I think there's this whole rich vein

51:55.940 --> 52:00.380
 in this bittersweet tradition that he embodies

52:00.380 --> 52:02.060
 that's like the essence of beauty.

52:02.060 --> 52:05.260
 You know, it's the way you embrace the sun and the moon.

52:05.260 --> 52:07.560
 The song Hallelujah, I return to that often,

52:08.660 --> 52:10.140
 have been meaning to play it.

52:11.820 --> 52:14.260
 I have now a friend who wants to sing it with me.

52:15.180 --> 52:16.020
 Are you a singer?

52:16.020 --> 52:16.860
 Mm.

52:20.860 --> 52:22.540
 When somebody says they're a singer,

52:22.540 --> 52:23.740
 do they have to be good?

52:23.740 --> 52:27.540
 Because then no, but I would say yes.

52:27.540 --> 52:28.900
 I was in a band for a while.

52:28.900 --> 52:29.740
 I sang for a while.

52:29.740 --> 52:33.940
 I was always bad, but I enjoy it.

52:33.940 --> 52:34.780
 I enjoy it.

52:34.780 --> 52:35.660
 I enjoy lyrics.

52:35.660 --> 52:37.180
 I enjoy words.

52:37.180 --> 52:40.620
 When sung or spoken, they capture something.

52:40.620 --> 52:41.920
 Like again, that moment.

52:42.840 --> 52:45.380
 Tom Waits is a huge favorite of mine for that reason.

52:46.660 --> 52:51.660
 Although he often, his lyrics are often not that simple.

52:51.660 --> 52:54.940
 I'd rather have a bottle in front of me

52:54.940 --> 52:56.420
 than a frontal lobotomy.

52:56.420 --> 53:01.420
 He's always playing with just like these weird word play

53:02.180 --> 53:04.260
 that's, especially in the English language,

53:04.260 --> 53:06.260
 just trickier to do.

53:06.260 --> 53:08.060
 I'm fortunate enough to know another language,

53:08.060 --> 53:10.700
 which is Russian, so I get to understand

53:10.700 --> 53:14.800
 that certain languages allow for more word play than others.

53:15.780 --> 53:18.220
 English, for that reason, I don't think has a,

53:18.220 --> 53:23.220
 like a culture of, you know what,

53:23.420 --> 53:25.300
 I need to push back on what I'm about to say,

53:25.300 --> 53:30.220
 but there was no culture of word play

53:30.220 --> 53:33.020
 until hip hop came along.

53:33.020 --> 53:37.100
 So like distorting words in interesting ways

53:37.100 --> 53:39.520
 for there to be a rhythm, a rhyme,

53:40.720 --> 53:42.320
 and at the same time you're capturing

53:42.320 --> 53:46.780
 some really powerful message plus humor.

53:46.780 --> 53:47.660
 All of that mixed in.

53:47.660 --> 53:49.700
 Actually hip hop does a really good job of this,

53:49.700 --> 53:50.980
 but there wasn't a tradition,

53:50.980 --> 53:53.140
 if you look at poetry in the 20th century,

53:53.140 --> 53:54.580
 there wasn't really a tradition of that

53:54.580 --> 53:57.580
 in the United States, but there was in other parts

53:57.580 --> 53:59.600
 of the world and certainly in Russia.

53:59.600 --> 54:00.440
 Interesting.

54:00.440 --> 54:02.320
 Empowered also not just by the language,

54:02.320 --> 54:03.960
 by the fact that you go through a world war

54:03.960 --> 54:05.860
 where tens of millions of people die.

54:05.860 --> 54:09.740
 Something about mass death of civilians

54:09.740 --> 54:12.840
 that inspires great literature and music and art.

54:12.840 --> 54:14.740
 Yeah, absolutely, because you start telling

54:14.740 --> 54:16.060
 the real truth, I think.

54:16.060 --> 54:19.560
 Yes, there's no more reason for small talk.

54:21.620 --> 54:24.860
 That's funny, I always have thought that

54:24.860 --> 54:27.300
 if I could choose any other medium besides writing,

54:27.300 --> 54:28.560
 it would be singing.

54:29.900 --> 54:30.740
 But then.

54:30.740 --> 54:31.560
 Are you a singer?

54:31.560 --> 54:32.540
 No, I mean like I'm really not,

54:32.540 --> 54:34.480
 I just love the idea of it.

54:34.480 --> 54:35.620
 But then I also think, you know,

54:35.620 --> 54:37.260
 I'm fundamentally a shy person,

54:37.260 --> 54:39.940
 so I think it's much better that my medium is writing

54:39.940 --> 54:42.540
 instead of singing, so like it all worked out.

54:42.540 --> 54:46.540
 That said, you're also an exceptionally good public speaker

54:46.540 --> 54:51.380
 and you're not supposed to be, mathematically speaking.

54:51.380 --> 54:52.580
 Mathematically speaking.

54:52.580 --> 54:54.580
 You're not supposed to be a good public speaker.

54:54.580 --> 54:56.340
 Oh, you mean because of shyness?

54:56.340 --> 54:58.300
 Yeah, because of shyness, because of introversion,

54:58.300 --> 54:59.700
 because of all those kinds of things.

54:59.700 --> 55:02.540
 Oh yeah, but lots of introverts are public speakers,

55:02.540 --> 55:04.060
 actually, like this is one of,

55:04.060 --> 55:06.780
 I knew this from the studies, but then also

55:06.780 --> 55:08.860
 when I started going out on the lecture circuit,

55:08.860 --> 55:10.600
 I realized that all my fellow speakers

55:10.600 --> 55:12.500
 at all these conferences I was going to,

55:12.500 --> 55:15.340
 they're all introverts, because they're all people

55:15.340 --> 55:18.420
 who spent years figuring out some idea

55:18.420 --> 55:19.820
 and now they're out there talking about it.

55:19.820 --> 55:22.140
 Oh, they're in their head figuring out the idea?

55:22.140 --> 55:22.980
 Yeah.

55:22.980 --> 55:26.700
 So how do you explain that the public speakers,

55:26.700 --> 55:28.220
 would you say the good public speakers

55:28.220 --> 55:29.860
 are usually introverts?

55:29.860 --> 55:32.100
 No, I think there's just different styles of it

55:32.100 --> 55:33.620
 and I think that we just have,

55:34.500 --> 55:36.220
 when we hear the word public speaker,

55:36.220 --> 55:40.900
 we have a really limited idea of who that person would be.

55:40.900 --> 55:44.940
 So for me, I used to be very phobic about public speaking

55:44.940 --> 55:47.460
 and part of the reason for it was because

55:47.460 --> 55:50.140
 I thought that being the kind of person I was,

55:51.180 --> 55:54.140
 didn't equal being able to be a good public speaker,

55:54.140 --> 55:56.020
 because you're only imagining,

55:56.020 --> 55:58.840
 like the super kind of out there showman.

56:00.260 --> 56:02.260
 But I think there's another style of public speaking

56:02.260 --> 56:05.660
 that's more reflective and thoughtful

56:05.660 --> 56:08.380
 and conveying ideas and people like that too.

56:08.380 --> 56:10.860
 Is there advice you can give on how to overcome that?

56:10.860 --> 56:15.300
 Like if you're a shy person, how to be a public speaker.

56:15.300 --> 56:18.700
 I can totally give that advice because I used to,

56:18.700 --> 56:20.580
 before I would give speeches,

56:20.580 --> 56:22.200
 if I had to do it in law school,

56:22.200 --> 56:24.000
 if I knew like today was the day

56:24.000 --> 56:26.540
 when I was gonna get called on in a law school class,

56:26.540 --> 56:29.100
 I literally one time vomited on my way to class.

56:29.100 --> 56:30.900
 Like that's how nervous I used to be.

56:30.900 --> 56:35.900
 And yeah, the way to do it is through desensitization.

56:37.020 --> 56:38.300
 It's like been figured out.

56:38.300 --> 56:39.860
 It's the way to overcome any fear.

56:39.860 --> 56:43.080
 You have to expose yourself to the thing you fear,

56:43.080 --> 56:45.180
 but in very small doses.

56:45.180 --> 56:48.020
 So you can't start by giving the TED talk.

56:48.020 --> 56:49.020
 You have to start.

56:49.020 --> 56:50.820
 I started by going to this class

56:50.820 --> 56:52.980
 for people with public speaking anxiety,

56:52.980 --> 56:54.820
 where on the first day,

56:54.820 --> 56:57.940
 all we had to do was stand up and say our name

56:57.940 --> 57:01.020
 and sit down and like that's the victory.

57:01.020 --> 57:03.700
 That's fun to watch all those people with anxiety.

57:05.540 --> 57:07.500
 Okay, that's the first step and the step,

57:07.500 --> 57:08.760
 one step at a time.

57:08.760 --> 57:10.380
 Yeah, and then like with this class,

57:10.380 --> 57:11.540
 you go back the next week

57:11.540 --> 57:15.340
 and he would have us come to the front of the room

57:15.340 --> 57:18.860
 and stand up with other people standing next to us

57:18.860 --> 57:20.800
 so that you didn't have the feeling

57:20.800 --> 57:22.500
 of being all alone in the spotlight

57:22.500 --> 57:24.380
 through others sharing it with you.

57:24.380 --> 57:25.740
 And you would answer some questions

57:25.740 --> 57:27.520
 about where do you grow up?

57:27.520 --> 57:29.100
 Where do you go to school?

57:29.100 --> 57:31.580
 And you declare victory and you're done.

57:31.580 --> 57:33.420
 And then little by little by little,

57:33.420 --> 57:35.580
 you keep ratcheting up the exercises

57:35.580 --> 57:37.940
 until you get to the point where you can do it.

57:37.940 --> 57:39.380
 And then you start having successes

57:39.380 --> 57:42.280
 and you realize, oh, you know, actually I can do this.

57:43.580 --> 57:46.580
 What about like writing versus improvising?

57:46.580 --> 57:47.980
 Because I knew a few people,

57:47.980 --> 57:49.500
 sort of the colleagues of mine

57:49.500 --> 57:50.940
 that were working on TED talks

57:50.940 --> 57:54.440
 and it feels like you're supposed to like

57:54.440 --> 57:56.860
 write the thing like way ahead of time

57:56.860 --> 57:58.820
 and you practice it and they help you

57:58.820 --> 58:00.300
 and all that kind of stuff.

58:00.300 --> 58:02.500
 I don't think I've ever practiced the speech

58:02.500 --> 58:04.900
 once in my life or a lecture or any of that.

58:04.900 --> 58:06.580
 Like I know it's really good to do,

58:06.580 --> 58:10.060
 but do you find that relieves

58:10.060 --> 58:11.940
 some of your anxiety preparing well

58:11.940 --> 58:15.860
 or are you now able to do not preparing well at all?

58:15.860 --> 58:19.880
 I definitely like to prepare before,

58:19.880 --> 58:23.260
 but the kind of preparation that I've done for my TED talks

58:23.260 --> 58:24.700
 is completely different

58:24.700 --> 58:26.260
 from what I've done for everything else.

58:26.260 --> 58:29.460
 Because TED talks are more like a theatrical event

58:29.460 --> 58:31.500
 where it's like a one person show.

58:31.500 --> 58:34.100
 And of course, if you were going to go on Broadway

58:34.100 --> 58:36.680
 with a monologue, you'd know every word.

58:36.680 --> 58:37.900
 So it's kind of like that.

58:37.900 --> 58:40.420
 And so I would rehearse it over and over

58:40.420 --> 58:41.700
 the way you would do that.

58:41.700 --> 58:44.940
 Isn't that more anxiety, knowing every single word?

58:44.940 --> 58:47.300
 It's so much anxiety because yeah,

58:47.300 --> 58:49.380
 you're not even so freaked out about being on stage

58:49.380 --> 58:51.620
 so much as what if I forget something?

58:51.620 --> 58:52.780
 Yeah, absolutely.

58:52.780 --> 58:57.020
 I mean, they do things like the last TED talk I gave,

58:57.020 --> 58:59.100
 I actually did forget something halfway through.

58:59.100 --> 59:01.300
 Like I just couldn't remember the next line.

59:02.260 --> 59:05.620
 And so I had to walk over, like over there were my notes.

59:05.620 --> 59:10.620
 And so I did that and the audience like very kindly clapped

59:10.620 --> 59:11.540
 while I did that.

59:11.540 --> 59:13.940
 And then I came back to the spotlight and kept going

59:13.940 --> 59:15.100
 and they edit that out.

59:15.100 --> 59:16.860
 Nice, so there's a failure mode.

59:16.860 --> 59:17.700
 It's okay.

59:18.900 --> 59:21.980
 It seems really, it seems really stressful.

59:21.980 --> 59:24.940
 Like I'm now, I'm not sure if I'll ever publish it,

59:24.940 --> 59:29.940
 but I've been, mostly it's for a personal journey,

59:30.700 --> 59:35.620
 but I've been working on a series on, wait for it,

59:35.620 --> 59:37.740
 Hitler and the Third Reich.

59:37.740 --> 59:40.580
 Sort of looking at the historical context of everything

59:40.580 --> 59:42.700
 because my family was so much affected

59:42.700 --> 59:44.460
 by that whole part of history.

59:44.460 --> 59:47.780
 So for me to rigorously, I've read a lot

59:47.780 --> 59:51.340
 about Stalin and Hitler, and for me to force myself,

59:51.340 --> 59:53.380
 one of the best ways to force yourself

59:53.380 --> 59:56.940
 to really consider material is to have to talk about it.

59:56.940 --> 59:59.460
 And so that's why I'm doing it,

59:59.460 --> 1:00:04.180
 but I'm playing with ideas of some of it,

1:00:04.180 --> 1:00:08.540
 maybe like 20% is written down on paper,

1:00:08.540 --> 1:00:11.300
 but the rest of it is my thoughts in the moment.

1:00:12.180 --> 1:00:15.220
 That's a difficult balance to strike

1:00:15.220 --> 1:00:17.620
 because if you write a lot, you're going to be more precise,

1:00:17.620 --> 1:00:20.340
 you're going to be more accurate,

1:00:20.340 --> 1:00:25.340
 but you're going to miss some of the deep, honest emotion.

1:00:25.420 --> 1:00:29.060
 The silences won't be correct,

1:00:29.060 --> 1:00:32.340
 or the silences between the words

1:00:32.340 --> 1:00:36.400
 won't capture the depth of feeling.

1:00:36.400 --> 1:00:38.300
 Unless, if you're somebody like me,

1:00:38.300 --> 1:00:40.720
 if you're like, I guess that's what actors

1:00:40.720 --> 1:00:42.220
 and actresses have to do.

1:00:44.420 --> 1:00:46.620
 Basically, even though the script is fully written,

1:00:46.620 --> 1:00:50.940
 you improvise between the words, between the lines.

1:00:50.940 --> 1:00:52.860
 But that's a skill.

1:00:52.860 --> 1:00:54.700
 Well, it also takes so much time.

1:00:54.700 --> 1:00:57.180
 I mean, I experienced that with the TED Talks.

1:00:57.180 --> 1:00:59.540
 It's like you get to a stage,

1:00:59.540 --> 1:01:01.940
 so you're memorizing everything word for word,

1:01:01.940 --> 1:01:04.580
 and at first, in that process,

1:01:04.580 --> 1:01:07.060
 it comes out in a really wooden way, the way you're saying,

1:01:07.060 --> 1:01:08.620
 like the emotion's gone.

1:01:08.620 --> 1:01:10.060
 But once you really know it,

1:01:10.060 --> 1:01:11.780
 so you've internalized the words,

1:01:11.780 --> 1:01:13.820
 then all the emotion comes back,

1:01:13.820 --> 1:01:16.020
 and you can say them in a completely different way.

1:01:16.020 --> 1:01:17.780
 And you're really speaking it from the heart.

1:01:17.780 --> 1:01:21.860
 But you have to know it so well before you can do that.

1:01:21.860 --> 1:01:23.420
 I would never recommend it,

1:01:23.420 --> 1:01:25.540
 because it's just like, it's so time consuming.

1:01:25.540 --> 1:01:28.340
 It's an inch, well, in your case, it works out beautifully.

1:01:28.340 --> 1:01:30.420
 Like when it all comes together,

1:01:30.420 --> 1:01:32.900
 it is a theatrical thing.

1:01:32.900 --> 1:01:35.060
 It's like a musical or whatever.

1:01:37.740 --> 1:01:41.120
 I think I'm gonna come out with a one man show on Broadway,

1:01:41.120 --> 1:01:43.540
 singing now, I'm inspired.

1:01:43.540 --> 1:01:47.300
 For real, where are you gonna talk about Hitler and Stalin

1:01:47.300 --> 1:01:48.140
 and everything you're learning?

1:01:48.140 --> 1:01:49.020
 Me too.

1:01:49.020 --> 1:01:52.500
 Have you ever thought of using the medium

1:01:52.500 --> 1:01:56.800
 of just speaking into a microphone, but without the video?

1:01:57.880 --> 1:01:58.720
 I'm curious about this,

1:01:58.720 --> 1:02:02.960
 because I fell in love with podcasts originally,

1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:05.900
 before there was ever this whole video component to it.

1:02:05.900 --> 1:02:09.280
 And I realized there's something so primal and magical

1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:12.380
 about having someone's voice in your ear.

1:02:12.380 --> 1:02:14.620
 And my favorite kinds of interviews still,

1:02:14.620 --> 1:02:16.600
 very few people do it this way nowadays,

1:02:16.600 --> 1:02:19.780
 but my favorite kind are when you're just talking

1:02:19.780 --> 1:02:20.980
 into the microphone.

1:02:20.980 --> 1:02:23.780
 So it's not over Zoom, it's not in person,

1:02:23.780 --> 1:02:25.620
 it's just you in the microphone

1:02:25.620 --> 1:02:26.940
 and the other person in the microphone

1:02:26.940 --> 1:02:28.340
 and they're in your ear.

1:02:28.340 --> 1:02:30.820
 It's like the ultimate in intimacy.

1:02:30.820 --> 1:02:32.540
 Oh, you mean from the interviewer perspective,

1:02:32.540 --> 1:02:33.580
 that's still your favorite.

1:02:33.580 --> 1:02:36.700
 Yeah, but it would be interesting also

1:02:36.700 --> 1:02:38.220
 with the kind of thing you were talking about

1:02:38.220 --> 1:02:40.660
 of just speaking, like just you and the mic.

1:02:40.660 --> 1:02:42.140
 I would love to be in person,

1:02:42.140 --> 1:02:43.420
 but you can't see the person.

1:02:43.420 --> 1:02:44.580
 I wonder what that's like.

1:02:44.580 --> 1:02:46.300
 What do you mean, like they're all there,

1:02:46.300 --> 1:02:47.140
 but behind a curtain?

1:02:47.140 --> 1:02:48.800
 No, you just have your eyes closed.

1:02:48.800 --> 1:02:50.480
 You're just talking, you have your eyes closed

1:02:50.480 --> 1:02:51.920
 or whatever you have,

1:02:51.920 --> 1:02:53.620
 because I think you still have to get

1:02:53.620 --> 1:02:54.580
 the same kind of chemistry,

1:02:54.580 --> 1:02:56.700
 because it's not just the visual.

1:02:56.700 --> 1:02:58.100
 I don't even know that,

1:02:58.100 --> 1:03:01.140
 because obviously I have trouble making eye contact.

1:03:01.140 --> 1:03:03.060
 But I don't know if the visual stimulation

1:03:03.060 --> 1:03:04.660
 is the necessary thing.

1:03:04.660 --> 1:03:07.400
 There's something about the way audio travels

1:03:07.400 --> 1:03:08.900
 that captures the intimacy,

1:03:08.900 --> 1:03:11.660
 where some people actually have headphones on,

1:03:11.660 --> 1:03:13.300
 like Joe does this, have headphones on.

1:03:13.300 --> 1:03:14.960
 That's really intimate.

1:03:14.960 --> 1:03:16.660
 Like there's something about that sound

1:03:16.660 --> 1:03:18.460
 going directly into your ear.

1:03:18.460 --> 1:03:20.500
 Yeah, there is something primal there.

1:03:20.500 --> 1:03:21.420
 Yeah, for sure.

1:03:23.840 --> 1:03:25.380
 I've thought about it, definitely.

1:03:25.380 --> 1:03:28.040
 And some of my favorite podcasts are like that,

1:03:28.040 --> 1:03:31.420
 WTF with Marc Maron, that's audio only.

1:03:31.420 --> 1:03:34.740
 There's a few audio only podcasts that I just love.

1:03:34.740 --> 1:03:35.580
 What is that?

1:03:35.580 --> 1:03:40.420
 I still go on Clubhouse, that was a social media platform

1:03:40.420 --> 1:03:41.900
 where it's audio only.

1:03:41.900 --> 1:03:44.260
 And it's so interesting that people,

1:03:44.260 --> 1:03:46.300
 the interesting thing about Clubhouse in particular

1:03:46.300 --> 1:03:48.500
 is people from all walks of life can tune in,

1:03:48.500 --> 1:03:50.740
 and they just have,

1:03:50.740 --> 1:03:53.480
 it's something you need to do some research

1:03:53.480 --> 1:03:55.020
 in terms of introversion on that one,

1:03:55.020 --> 1:03:58.140
 because I don't feel any of my introvert

1:04:00.540 --> 1:04:03.060
 like triggers happening.

1:04:03.060 --> 1:04:06.220
 Because nobody can see you, it's just audio,

1:04:06.220 --> 1:04:10.340
 and nobody is offended if you're just sitting there

1:04:10.340 --> 1:04:12.700
 quietly just listening.

1:04:12.700 --> 1:04:16.140
 So you can participate whenever you want or not.

1:04:16.140 --> 1:04:18.180
 Yeah, it's like the ultimate social freedom.

1:04:18.180 --> 1:04:19.820
 You can listen as much as you'd like,

1:04:19.820 --> 1:04:21.140
 you can participate if you want,

1:04:21.140 --> 1:04:22.740
 but you don't have to, it's no big deal.

1:04:22.740 --> 1:04:25.980
 Yeah, if I'm actually at a physical party,

1:04:25.980 --> 1:04:29.300
 somebody's gonna look at me and be like why,

1:04:29.300 --> 1:04:30.740
 there'll be that pressure to speak,

1:04:30.740 --> 1:04:34.380
 but you don't have to in that kind of audio setting.

1:04:34.380 --> 1:04:36.100
 And there's that intimacy.

1:04:36.100 --> 1:04:38.300
 Like you can, when it's audio only,

1:04:38.300 --> 1:04:40.620
 it feels like you can reveal a lot more of yourself

1:04:40.620 --> 1:04:43.700
 in some kind of honest way.

1:04:43.700 --> 1:04:44.740
 I don't know what that is.

1:04:44.740 --> 1:04:45.580
 What is that?

1:04:45.580 --> 1:04:46.400
 What is that?

1:04:46.400 --> 1:04:49.140
 I don't know, but I assume it's tapping into something

1:04:49.140 --> 1:04:49.980
 really ancient.

1:04:49.980 --> 1:04:51.880
 Like we used to tell stories around the fire,

1:04:51.880 --> 1:04:56.620
 like our whole storytelling tradition was oral originally.

1:04:56.620 --> 1:04:57.700
 So maybe it's that.

1:04:57.700 --> 1:05:00.460
 But we used visual stuff, like.

1:05:00.460 --> 1:05:01.940
 That's true, you could actually see the person

1:05:01.940 --> 1:05:03.780
 on the other side of the campfire.

1:05:03.780 --> 1:05:06.260
 It seems like the visual element's so fundamental

1:05:06.260 --> 1:05:07.520
 to the social interaction,

1:05:07.520 --> 1:05:11.820
 but there's something primal about audio.

1:05:11.820 --> 1:05:12.660
 I wonder what that is.

1:05:12.660 --> 1:05:14.140
 And still, that's why, I mean,

1:05:14.140 --> 1:05:17.360
 most people listen to podcasts, I think, audio only.

1:05:17.360 --> 1:05:19.460
 They have it in their ears while they're doing stuff.

1:05:19.460 --> 1:05:21.020
 Yeah, that's how I do it.

1:05:21.020 --> 1:05:22.660
 And then there's, yeah, that's how I do it too.

1:05:22.660 --> 1:05:26.780
 And that's where the friendship, like, is formed.

1:05:26.780 --> 1:05:30.240
 It's weird, that deep connection with other humans.

1:05:30.240 --> 1:05:32.240
 It's formed because they're in your ear.

1:05:34.820 --> 1:05:35.820
 And you get to see them grow.

1:05:35.820 --> 1:05:39.420
 You get to see them be bored, experience excitement,

1:05:39.420 --> 1:05:42.420
 and anger, and fear, and all those kinds of things.

1:05:42.420 --> 1:05:45.100
 It's fascinating, it's fascinating.

1:05:45.100 --> 1:05:46.900
 The world of podcasting is fascinating

1:05:46.900 --> 1:05:50.380
 because we're in this world of essentially radio,

1:05:51.280 --> 1:05:55.060
 even though we all have all this high definition content,

1:05:55.060 --> 1:05:59.020
 all this, like, TikTok style fast stuff and still podcasting.

1:05:59.020 --> 1:06:01.240
 I know, and we still choose to do this.

1:06:01.240 --> 1:06:02.080
 It's weird.

1:06:02.080 --> 1:06:02.900
 Because at the end of the day,

1:06:02.900 --> 1:06:04.520
 I think that's really what people want most,

1:06:04.520 --> 1:06:06.260
 is just to talk to each other

1:06:06.260 --> 1:06:07.740
 and to know what people really think.

1:06:07.740 --> 1:06:10.780
 And podcasting of all the media that I've ever seen

1:06:10.780 --> 1:06:12.540
 is the one where people come closest

1:06:12.540 --> 1:06:13.780
 to telling you the truth.

1:06:15.500 --> 1:06:17.620
 And, you know, just telling you, like,

1:06:17.620 --> 1:06:19.440
 the good and the bad and the bitter and the sweet

1:06:19.440 --> 1:06:20.280
 and all of it.

1:06:20.280 --> 1:06:21.900
 Especially long form, there's not enough time.

1:06:21.900 --> 1:06:23.020
 Yeah, exactly.

1:06:23.020 --> 1:06:24.840
 I had to explain this to people.

1:06:24.840 --> 1:06:27.400
 Like, you talk to CEOs and stuff.

1:06:27.400 --> 1:06:28.940
 They don't understand,

1:06:29.940 --> 1:06:31.980
 they're starting to understand much better.

1:06:31.980 --> 1:06:35.980
 Now, as a hard requirement with, like, CEOs and stuff,

1:06:35.980 --> 1:06:37.260
 it has to be three hours.

1:06:37.260 --> 1:06:39.340
 I say, like, this is...

1:06:39.340 --> 1:06:40.180
 Wow.

1:06:40.180 --> 1:06:42.680
 Because there's something,

1:06:42.680 --> 1:06:46.500
 they can't be doing marketing stuff for three hours.

1:06:46.500 --> 1:06:47.700
 They break.

1:06:47.700 --> 1:06:49.380
 They start being human, they start joking,

1:06:49.380 --> 1:06:50.460
 they start relaxing.

1:06:50.460 --> 1:06:53.420
 And if they can't, that also tells a kind of story.

1:06:53.420 --> 1:06:56.140
 But I do that kind of torture for CEOs only.

1:06:56.140 --> 1:06:56.980
 Anyway.

1:06:56.980 --> 1:06:58.780
 Yeah, when I was getting,

1:06:58.780 --> 1:07:01.360
 my publishing house did media training with me

1:07:01.360 --> 1:07:02.980
 before Bittersweet came out.

1:07:02.980 --> 1:07:07.140
 And they were preparing me for, like,

1:07:07.140 --> 1:07:10.300
 the five to seven minute interview that you might have,

1:07:10.300 --> 1:07:12.020
 you know, if you go on some quick TV thing

1:07:12.020 --> 1:07:13.340
 or something like that.

1:07:13.340 --> 1:07:14.580
 And God, I hate that.

1:07:14.580 --> 1:07:19.060
 It's like, it feels like you're basically having

1:07:19.060 --> 1:07:21.260
 to not tell the full truth somehow

1:07:21.260 --> 1:07:24.660
 because you can't tell it in such a short amount of time.

1:07:24.660 --> 1:07:25.500
 Well, the other...

1:07:25.500 --> 1:07:27.180
 So to me, podcasting is just the best thing

1:07:27.180 --> 1:07:28.340
 that's ever happened.

1:07:28.340 --> 1:07:32.100
 The other downside of the seven minute interview

1:07:33.040 --> 1:07:35.140
 is I think you could do a really good job with that,

1:07:35.140 --> 1:07:37.840
 but the dance partner has to be very good.

1:07:37.840 --> 1:07:39.860
 It's actually challenging for everybody involved.

1:07:39.860 --> 1:07:41.860
 It's much harder for everybody involved.

1:07:43.620 --> 1:07:45.460
 Because if you can do, you know,

1:07:45.460 --> 1:07:48.300
 I can imagine like a Christopher Hitchens type character

1:07:48.300 --> 1:07:50.080
 who's just super witty,

1:07:50.980 --> 1:07:52.900
 then you could do a seven minute thing.

1:07:52.900 --> 1:07:55.340
 You can get to the core of Bittersweet.

1:07:55.340 --> 1:07:57.100
 You can get to the core of the book

1:07:57.100 --> 1:07:59.300
 without asking those generic small talk questions.

1:07:59.300 --> 1:08:03.780
 Because too many people in that short form interview

1:08:03.780 --> 1:08:05.780
 are just asking very generic questions.

1:08:05.780 --> 1:08:07.900
 They're doing small talk for seven minutes.

1:08:07.900 --> 1:08:11.020
 It's like, all right, you only get seven minutes.

1:08:11.020 --> 1:08:13.540
 You only get one interesting question.

1:08:13.540 --> 1:08:16.540
 Go ask the weirdest, the deepest question

1:08:16.540 --> 1:08:20.740
 that also energizes the other person.

1:08:20.740 --> 1:08:25.020
 It's an art form that people don't take seriously.

1:08:25.020 --> 1:08:29.140
 I think the seven minute thing, five minute or even less.

1:08:29.140 --> 1:08:31.860
 And then the commercials, which I...

1:08:31.860 --> 1:08:36.860
 Yeah, and I've noticed that many of the best podcasters

1:08:37.080 --> 1:08:39.940
 are ones where when you're on my side of the table,

1:08:39.940 --> 1:08:42.060
 you feel like it's more of a conversation

1:08:42.060 --> 1:08:43.700
 and less like an interview

1:08:43.700 --> 1:08:45.220
 where you're answering all the same questions

1:08:45.220 --> 1:08:47.780
 you've answered a million times before.

1:08:47.780 --> 1:08:51.020
 It's really interesting how different the experience is.

1:08:51.020 --> 1:08:52.920
 And you're right, the audio thing,

1:08:52.920 --> 1:08:57.840
 if you can lose yourself in that, the intimacy of that.

1:08:57.840 --> 1:09:00.520
 And you don't even remember what stupid stuff you said.

1:09:00.520 --> 1:09:03.160
 People, I've seen that, I mean,

1:09:03.160 --> 1:09:05.160
 people don't give them enough credit as...

1:09:05.160 --> 1:09:08.880
 You might not be aware, might not be a fan,

1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:12.520
 but Joe Rogan is an incredible conversationalist

1:09:12.520 --> 1:09:17.520
 in that he makes you forget that anything's being recorded,

1:09:18.400 --> 1:09:20.560
 that you're talking at all.

1:09:20.560 --> 1:09:23.860
 He makes you forget time and you just enjoy yourself.

1:09:23.860 --> 1:09:26.080
 And that's whatever that is.

1:09:28.040 --> 1:09:30.920
 And then you plug into that primal connection

1:09:30.920 --> 1:09:31.800
 to other humans.

1:09:34.520 --> 1:09:36.180
 What's your favorite Leonard Cohen song?

1:09:36.180 --> 1:09:37.480
 Famous Blue Raincoat.

1:09:37.480 --> 1:09:38.320
 Do you know that one?

1:09:38.320 --> 1:09:40.040
 Yeah, maybe I'll play it.

1:09:40.040 --> 1:09:43.640
 Yeah, for people who don't know Leonard Cohen

1:09:43.640 --> 1:09:45.760
 and this is your first introduction to him,

1:09:45.760 --> 1:09:49.520
 it's gonna sound so gloomy, but it's so good.

1:09:49.520 --> 1:09:52.000
 He's got this deep, rich voice.

1:09:52.960 --> 1:09:55.480
 Tony Amos covering Famous Blue Raincoat, yeah, yeah.

1:09:55.480 --> 1:09:58.680
 No, we want the original.

1:09:58.680 --> 1:10:02.160
 Just like Hallelujah, Jeff Buckley covered Leonard Cohen.

1:10:02.160 --> 1:10:03.160
 That was a really good one.

1:10:03.160 --> 1:10:04.760
 That was a really good one, yeah.

1:10:04.760 --> 1:10:07.980
 And I also really like Rufus Wainwright's cover.

1:10:07.980 --> 1:10:10.120
 But Famous Blue Raincoat, for people who don't know it,

1:10:10.120 --> 1:10:13.880
 it's basically about a love triangle

1:10:13.880 --> 1:10:17.100
 and it's told from the perspective of a man

1:10:17.100 --> 1:10:20.680
 whose wife has just been with another guy

1:10:20.680 --> 1:10:23.380
 who is also his friend.

1:10:23.380 --> 1:10:26.200
 And he's writing a letter to that other guy

1:10:26.200 --> 1:10:28.740
 and he's reflecting on the way

1:10:28.740 --> 1:10:30.480
 that all their relationships have changed

1:10:30.480 --> 1:10:33.840
 in the wake of this event.

1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:36.080
 So they're still friends.

1:10:36.080 --> 1:10:38.180
 So they're still, well, he refers to him

1:10:38.180 --> 1:10:40.220
 as my brother, my killer,

1:10:40.220 --> 1:10:42.040
 which is such a Leonard Cohen thing to do

1:10:42.040 --> 1:10:44.040
 because it's always like, you know,

1:10:44.040 --> 1:10:48.480
 it's light and it's dark, all at once.

1:10:48.480 --> 1:10:50.140
 Nothing is ever all one thing.

1:10:59.920 --> 1:11:02.040
 Yeah, I love this song.

1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:02.880
 Yeah, right?

1:11:02.880 --> 1:11:03.700
 I mean.

1:11:03.700 --> 1:11:05.700
 He just speaks in it.

1:11:05.700 --> 1:11:10.700
 It's four in the morning, the end of December.

1:11:12.700 --> 1:11:14.900
 And the fact that it's four in the morning

1:11:14.900 --> 1:11:16.220
 and it's the end of December,

1:11:16.220 --> 1:11:18.700
 like those are transitional moments, you know?

1:11:18.700 --> 1:11:20.700
 It's night going into day

1:11:20.700 --> 1:11:23.700
 and it's December going into the new year.

1:11:23.700 --> 1:11:27.700
 And it's the end of December and it's the end of December.

1:11:27.700 --> 1:11:31.700
 And it's the end of December and it's the end of December.

1:11:31.700 --> 1:11:34.700
 And it's December going into the new year.

1:11:34.700 --> 1:11:36.700
 It's not an accident.

1:11:39.700 --> 1:11:41.700
 There is something about December.

1:11:41.700 --> 1:11:44.700
 Whatever, there's certain scenes you can paint in your mind.

1:11:46.700 --> 1:11:50.700
 There's a poem by Charles Bukowski called Nirvana.

1:11:50.700 --> 1:11:53.700
 It's a young man traveling through the middle of nowhere

1:11:53.700 --> 1:11:54.700
 in the snow.

1:11:54.700 --> 1:11:55.700
 There's something about the snow,

1:11:55.700 --> 1:11:57.700
 either the rain or the snow

1:11:57.700 --> 1:11:59.700
 can put you in a certain kind of mood

1:11:59.700 --> 1:12:02.700
 that just, what is it, James Joyce?

1:12:02.700 --> 1:12:06.700
 The dead, the snow is falling on Dublin.

1:12:06.700 --> 1:12:08.700
 Yeah, it can put you in a place.

1:12:08.700 --> 1:12:10.700
 I mean, David Yaden,

1:12:10.700 --> 1:12:13.700
 he's a researcher in psychedelics and consciousness

1:12:13.700 --> 1:12:15.700
 at Johns Hopkins.

1:12:15.700 --> 1:12:16.700
 He's a great guy.

1:12:16.700 --> 1:12:18.700
 And he's done research that has found

1:12:18.700 --> 1:12:22.700
 that when people are in their transitional moments of life,

1:12:22.700 --> 1:12:24.700
 and it could be a career change,

1:12:24.700 --> 1:12:25.700
 it could be a divorce,

1:12:25.700 --> 1:12:28.700
 it could be that they're nearing the end of their life,

1:12:28.700 --> 1:12:30.700
 that they very often will say,

1:12:30.700 --> 1:12:32.700
 those are their most meaningful moments

1:12:32.700 --> 1:12:34.700
 and their most spiritual moments.

1:12:34.700 --> 1:12:36.700
 And so I feel like that's what Leonard Cohen

1:12:36.700 --> 1:12:38.700
 knows how to tap into instinctively.

1:12:38.700 --> 1:12:42.700
 The year after he died, his son, Adam Cohen,

1:12:42.700 --> 1:12:44.700
 made a memorial concert for him

1:12:44.700 --> 1:12:46.700
 where all these famous musicians came to Montreal

1:12:46.700 --> 1:12:50.700
 where they had lived and performed his music.

1:12:50.700 --> 1:12:53.700
 And my husband, who's not a Leonard Cohen fan

1:12:53.700 --> 1:12:55.700
 and he's not a bittersweet type at all,

1:12:55.700 --> 1:12:56.700
 but he knows how I feel about him,

1:12:56.700 --> 1:12:59.700
 he's like, you should really go to that concert.

1:12:59.700 --> 1:13:01.700
 And I felt so ridiculous.

1:13:01.700 --> 1:13:05.700
 The whole family went all the way to Montreal on a Monday.

1:13:05.700 --> 1:13:06.700
 On a Monday.

1:13:06.700 --> 1:13:07.700
 On a Monday.

1:13:07.700 --> 1:13:09.700
 It was just like a random Monday.

1:13:09.700 --> 1:13:10.700
 And we got on the plane.

1:13:10.700 --> 1:13:13.700
 So everyone's out of school,

1:13:13.700 --> 1:13:17.700
 just so I can go to this concert.

1:13:17.700 --> 1:13:20.700
 And I got there and at the beginning,

1:13:20.700 --> 1:13:23.700
 I was feeling like, this was all a terrible mistake

1:13:23.700 --> 1:13:27.700
 because it's all these other musicians playing this music

1:13:27.700 --> 1:13:29.700
 and I don't actually really want to hear them.

1:13:29.700 --> 1:13:31.700
 I'd rather listen to him on YouTube.

1:13:31.700 --> 1:13:37.700
 And then a musician named Damien Rice came

1:13:37.700 --> 1:13:40.700
 and played Famous Blue Raincoat and he sang it.

1:13:40.700 --> 1:13:44.700
 And he did the most amazing thing at the end.

1:13:44.700 --> 1:13:45.700
 The whole thing was amazing.

1:13:45.700 --> 1:13:48.700
 But then at the end, he sang this musical riff

1:13:48.700 --> 1:13:55.700
 that was like, all I could say is that it was like a musical lamentation of the ages.

1:13:55.700 --> 1:14:00.700
 And the whole audience just rose silently to its feet.

1:14:00.700 --> 1:14:04.700
 And it was one of the greatest moments that I've ever had.

1:14:04.700 --> 1:14:07.700
 There's sometimes certain artists in a cover can capture

1:14:07.700 --> 1:14:09.700
 in some kind of deeper way,

1:14:09.700 --> 1:14:13.700
 like carrying the thread of the power of the song.

1:14:13.700 --> 1:14:20.700
 So I've been listening a lot to Johnny Cash Heart, which is a Nine Inch Nails Trent Reznor song.

1:14:20.700 --> 1:14:22.700
 You talked about it on your podcast with Rick Rubin,

1:14:22.700 --> 1:14:24.700
 which is when I reached out to you.

1:14:24.700 --> 1:14:27.700
 I love that interview and I love that song also.

1:14:27.700 --> 1:14:30.700
 Yeah, so there's that.

1:14:30.700 --> 1:14:33.700
 There's the Kennedy Center Honors where they celebrated certain artists.

1:14:33.700 --> 1:14:36.700
 They did that for Led Zeppelin and I forgot what her name is,

1:14:36.700 --> 1:14:41.700
 but the lead singer of Heart performs There We're To Heaven.

1:14:41.700 --> 1:14:44.700
 And it's like, if you're like, all right,

1:14:44.700 --> 1:14:48.700
 you take one of the great sort of rock songs of all time, what do you do?

1:14:48.700 --> 1:14:53.700
 Oh, the cool thing is you get to perform this in front of the artist

1:14:53.700 --> 1:14:55.700
 while they're still there, you know, they're still alive.

1:14:55.700 --> 1:14:58.700
 So you get to watch you sort of perform,

1:14:58.700 --> 1:15:00.700
 and in that case, the president and President Obama's there

1:15:00.700 --> 1:15:03.700
 and she's just knocked it out of the park.

1:15:03.700 --> 1:15:10.700
 But at the same time, without outdoing the original,

1:15:10.700 --> 1:15:12.700
 somehow you're just making it your own.

1:15:12.700 --> 1:15:16.700
 You're making it your own, but not departing completely,

1:15:16.700 --> 1:15:19.700
 not departing from the spirit of the original.

1:15:19.700 --> 1:15:24.700
 It's tough because the original Halu by Leonard Cohen,

1:15:24.700 --> 1:15:27.700
 it's just not, it's so powerful,

1:15:27.700 --> 1:15:31.700
 but it's just not as good as some of these covers.

1:15:31.700 --> 1:15:34.700
 Well, I think it's the words and the melody

1:15:34.700 --> 1:15:37.700
 and then the covers take it to a different place.

1:15:37.700 --> 1:15:39.700
 The thing that Leonard Cohen seems to do well,

1:15:39.700 --> 1:15:44.700
 I don't think he did it on Hallelujah

1:15:44.700 --> 1:15:47.700
 because he was almost being playful on Hallelujah.

1:15:47.700 --> 1:15:52.700
 Like, I don't know, as opposed to that deep melancholy,

1:15:52.700 --> 1:15:58.700
 like painful longing thing that Jeff Buckley did and others do too.

1:15:58.700 --> 1:16:03.700
 I wonder if it's because in a way he, I don't mean that he over edited it,

1:16:03.700 --> 1:16:05.700
 but he apparently worked on that song for years

1:16:05.700 --> 1:16:08.700
 and went through gazillions of verses and checked most of them out.

1:16:08.700 --> 1:16:09.700
 Yeah.

1:16:09.700 --> 1:16:11.700
 So I wonder if we're hearing his version

1:16:11.700 --> 1:16:15.700
 after he's like a little tired with that process.

1:16:15.700 --> 1:16:21.700
 Yeah. Well, that's the other thing is like maybe from a book tour, you know,

1:16:21.700 --> 1:16:24.700
 it's like you get tired of saying the same thing over and over and over and over.

1:16:24.700 --> 1:16:26.700
 You forget, you forget the...

1:16:26.700 --> 1:16:29.700
 You forgot like the initial, like the heart of it.

1:16:29.700 --> 1:16:34.700
 Yeah. But I actually got a chance to hang out with Dan Reynolds,

1:16:34.700 --> 1:16:42.700
 who's the lead singer of Imagine Dragons, this incredible band, Super Pop.

1:16:42.700 --> 1:16:43.700
 Yeah.

1:16:43.700 --> 1:16:45.700
 The most played band on like Spotify or something.

1:16:45.700 --> 1:16:46.700
 Is that right?

1:16:46.700 --> 1:16:48.700
 His kids went through a huge Imagine Dragons phase,

1:16:48.700 --> 1:16:50.700
 so we were listening to their music a lot.

1:16:50.700 --> 1:16:54.700
 It was so surreal to be hanging out with him and he's such a good,

1:16:54.700 --> 1:16:59.700
 like very few people I've met in my life are just as good of a human being.

1:16:59.700 --> 1:17:01.700
 And that has to do with the fact that he struggles.

1:17:01.700 --> 1:17:06.700
 He struggles, he still I think struggles, but he struggled for a long time with depression.

1:17:06.700 --> 1:17:12.700
 And so out of that pain, you see born this really good human being,

1:17:12.700 --> 1:17:15.700
 this really good relationship with his wife.

1:17:15.700 --> 1:17:20.700
 Like when times are good, they lean on each other for like,

1:17:20.700 --> 1:17:23.700
 they're deeply grateful for those precious moments.

1:17:23.700 --> 1:17:25.700
 So it's beautiful to watch.

1:17:25.700 --> 1:17:33.700
 But he said that it's really important to feel the song every time.

1:17:33.700 --> 1:17:35.700
 Otherwise people know.

1:17:35.700 --> 1:17:38.700
 People are really good at detecting your bullshit.

1:17:38.700 --> 1:17:39.700
 You can't fake it.

1:17:39.700 --> 1:17:40.700
 Yeah.

1:17:40.700 --> 1:17:41.700
 You really have to feel it every time.

1:17:41.700 --> 1:17:44.700
 You have to feel the emotion of it, whatever the emotion is,

1:17:44.700 --> 1:17:48.700
 of the original time you wrote it.

1:17:48.700 --> 1:17:49.700
 Yeah.

1:17:49.700 --> 1:17:54.700
 So it's just interesting because it put, I thought you could maybe fake it,

1:17:54.700 --> 1:17:58.700
 but he believes personally because he played in front of the gigantic crowds

1:17:58.700 --> 1:18:00.700
 and over and over and over and over and over.

1:18:00.700 --> 1:18:03.700
 He's like, no, every time you have to be there.

1:18:03.700 --> 1:18:07.700
 But there's got to be times when he's about to go out and he's not feeling it

1:18:07.700 --> 1:18:10.700
 and he has to figure out some way of getting himself into that heart space.

1:18:10.700 --> 1:18:11.700
 Well, that's what he's saying.

1:18:11.700 --> 1:18:15.700
 You have to, otherwise you're just, that's the job.

1:18:15.700 --> 1:18:18.700
 Don't take the job then.

1:18:18.700 --> 1:18:20.700
 And he loves it.

1:18:20.700 --> 1:18:24.700
 He says the biggest struggle, in fact, is the come down from that,

1:18:24.700 --> 1:18:30.700
 which is like you have such a beautiful experience of connecting with this large number of people,

1:18:30.700 --> 1:18:36.700
 sharing a song that you love, and then it's just a rush of connection.

1:18:36.700 --> 1:18:43.700
 And then you have to, you know, when you get off stage, you're now back to normal life.

1:18:43.700 --> 1:18:46.700
 And that's why a lot of musicians get into heavy drugs and all that kind of stuff

1:18:46.700 --> 1:18:49.700
 because you're looking for that rush again.

1:18:49.700 --> 1:18:53.700
 It's very tough to like then go into this, speaking of introvert,

1:18:53.700 --> 1:18:58.700
 because he probably is an introvert, is like you have to find that calmness.

1:18:58.700 --> 1:19:03.700
 And how do you find the calmness when you were just playing in front of tens of thousands of people

1:19:03.700 --> 1:19:07.700
 or hundreds of thousands, whatever that number is, that rush of connecting.

1:19:07.700 --> 1:19:09.700
 And everybody, there's love in the air.

1:19:09.700 --> 1:19:12.700
 And you still have to find that like inner peace and calm.

1:19:12.700 --> 1:19:13.700
 That's interesting.

1:19:13.700 --> 1:19:18.700
 So I don't know if this is the introvert in me talking and the writer in me talking,

1:19:18.700 --> 1:19:21.700
 but I don't know.

1:19:21.700 --> 1:19:26.700
 Like I love most the moments where let's say I'll get a letter from a reader

1:19:26.700 --> 1:19:29.700
 who will tell me what something I wrote meant to them.

1:19:29.700 --> 1:19:32.700
 And they'll talk about having had that kind of moment of, you know,

1:19:32.700 --> 1:19:34.700
 the communion between the writer and the reader.

1:19:34.700 --> 1:19:36.700
 And obviously I wasn't there physically when it happened,

1:19:36.700 --> 1:19:40.700
 so I wasn't getting that kind of rush that a musician would get in a concert.

1:19:40.700 --> 1:19:45.700
 But just the knowledge of that having happened out there in the world

1:19:45.700 --> 1:19:49.700
 to do just something that I added to it is the most amazing thing.

1:19:49.700 --> 1:19:50.700
 You love it.

1:19:50.700 --> 1:19:54.700
 But imagine reading like thousands of those letters,

1:19:54.700 --> 1:19:59.700
 and then it's such a strong rush and everything else doesn't.

1:19:59.700 --> 1:20:01.700
 It could be overwhelming I guess.

1:20:01.700 --> 1:20:06.700
 But like anything else, you have to come down and find a calm place.

1:20:06.700 --> 1:20:09.700
 Like for example, the danger with getting letters like that,

1:20:09.700 --> 1:20:11.700
 you start taking yourself too seriously.

1:20:11.700 --> 1:20:14.700
 You think like you are a special person somehow.

1:20:14.700 --> 1:20:19.700
 But you really want to avoid that feeling too.

1:20:19.700 --> 1:20:22.700
 Yeah, I don't actually experience it as that much different

1:20:22.700 --> 1:20:24.700
 from when I'm on the other side of it.

1:20:24.700 --> 1:20:28.700
 Like if I'm the reader and some other writer has made me feel that way,

1:20:28.700 --> 1:20:29.700
 to me it's the same thing.

1:20:29.700 --> 1:20:30.700
 Yeah, me too.

1:20:30.700 --> 1:20:34.700
 Yeah, it's a cool, it's a virtual hug.

1:20:34.700 --> 1:20:36.700
 I think it's like I was just listening to something

1:20:36.700 --> 1:20:42.700
 about the different Russian writers.

1:20:42.700 --> 1:20:44.700
 I was mentioning him to you, this academic.

1:20:44.700 --> 1:20:48.700
 His name is Gary Salmorson, and he studies Russian literature.

1:20:48.700 --> 1:20:51.700
 And he was talking about, I don't know if I'll be able to get this right,

1:20:51.700 --> 1:20:55.700
 but basically that the people misunderstand a work like Anna Karenina

1:20:55.700 --> 1:21:02.700
 and that we think of it as telling us that you're supposed to live,

1:21:02.700 --> 1:21:08.700
 you're supposed to have like these grand, tempestuous romances

1:21:08.700 --> 1:21:12.700
 that might end in death or despair or whatever it is,

1:21:12.700 --> 1:21:15.700
 but you should be in it for the intensity of the emotion.

1:21:15.700 --> 1:21:22.700
 And he's saying actually that's exactly not what Tolstoy was saying,

1:21:22.700 --> 1:21:24.700
 that actually it was the opposite,

1:21:24.700 --> 1:21:27.700
 that he was really advocating for everyday life.

1:21:27.700 --> 1:21:29.700
 He was saying it's scenes from everyday life.

1:21:29.700 --> 1:21:32.700
 He was juxtaposing Anna Karenina with all these other couples

1:21:32.700 --> 1:21:36.700
 who were just living happily and quietly day by day.

1:21:36.700 --> 1:21:41.700
 And that was what he believed was the ideal,

1:21:41.700 --> 1:21:45.700
 as opposed to the grand rush and as opposed to the intensity.

1:21:45.700 --> 1:21:52.700
 I wonder if he, is there a romance just at day to day?

1:21:52.700 --> 1:21:55.700
 I think there is a romance to the day to day, absolutely.

1:21:55.700 --> 1:21:58.700
 Don't get distracted by the dopamine rollercoaster ride

1:21:58.700 --> 1:22:00.700
 of the grand romantic notions.

1:22:00.700 --> 1:22:02.700
 Yeah, and enjoy it while it's happening,

1:22:02.700 --> 1:22:04.700
 because those are real life experiences also,

1:22:04.700 --> 1:22:07.700
 but not to mistake those for being everything.

1:22:07.700 --> 1:22:09.700
 Where is he from?

1:22:09.700 --> 1:22:11.700
 He's a professor at Northwestern.

1:22:11.700 --> 1:22:12.700
 At Northwestern.

1:22:12.700 --> 1:22:15.700
 And apparently his lectures are like the most popular on campus.

1:22:15.700 --> 1:22:17.700
 Wow, people love him.

1:22:17.700 --> 1:22:21.700
 Gary Saul Morrison is an American literary critic and slobist.

1:22:21.700 --> 1:22:23.700
 He's particularly known for his scholarly work

1:22:23.700 --> 1:22:28.700
 on the great Russian novelists Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky.

1:22:28.700 --> 1:22:31.700
 Morrison is Lawrence D. Professor in the Arts and Humanities

1:22:31.700 --> 1:22:32.700
 at Northwestern University.

1:22:32.700 --> 1:22:33.700
 Yeah.

1:22:33.700 --> 1:22:35.700
 Wow, and there's a lot of incredible work.

1:22:35.700 --> 1:22:38.700
 And then I'm sure looking through the lens of Russian literature

1:22:38.700 --> 1:22:41.700
 and the romance of all of that, he's looking at the modern world.

1:22:41.700 --> 1:22:42.700
 Yeah.

1:22:42.700 --> 1:22:44.700
 I think you should have him on your podcast.

1:22:44.700 --> 1:22:48.700
 And Quiet Flows the Vodka or When Pushkin Comes to Shove

1:22:48.700 --> 1:22:51.700
 the curmudgeon's guide to Russian literature and culture.

1:22:51.700 --> 1:22:54.700
 This is one of the silly books he has on the list.

1:22:54.700 --> 1:22:55.700
 Okay, cool.

1:22:55.700 --> 1:22:56.700
 What were you saying?

1:22:56.700 --> 1:22:57.700
 I'm sorry.

1:22:57.700 --> 1:23:01.700
 Oh, no, I was just saying, yeah, like I find that when I take photos

1:23:01.700 --> 1:23:05.700
 on my phone, I hardly ever take photos at the moment you're supposed to.

1:23:05.700 --> 1:23:07.700
 Like everybody's gathered for some event.

1:23:07.700 --> 1:23:09.700
 I'll forget to take the photo.

1:23:09.700 --> 1:23:11.700
 But I take a lot of like scenes from everyday life

1:23:11.700 --> 1:23:15.700
 because that's what I actually want to remember in the end.

1:23:15.700 --> 1:23:18.700
 Yeah, yeah, I'm the same.

1:23:18.700 --> 1:23:19.700
 The same.

1:23:19.700 --> 1:23:23.700
 It's actually concerning because it's bad for productivity

1:23:23.700 --> 1:23:26.700
 because I love everyday life so much.

1:23:26.700 --> 1:23:29.700
 Then why do any ambitious big thing?

1:23:29.700 --> 1:23:31.700
 Your productivity is pretty good.

1:23:31.700 --> 1:23:33.700
 I don't know that you have to worry about it.

1:23:33.700 --> 1:23:34.700
 I do.

1:23:34.700 --> 1:23:36.700
 So I want to launch a business.

1:23:36.700 --> 1:23:38.700
 I have a dream outside.

1:23:38.700 --> 1:23:45.700
 This is like a fun side thing that there's been a lifelong passion.

1:23:45.700 --> 1:23:47.700
 Anyway, I like building.

1:23:47.700 --> 1:23:50.700
 I like building stuff and I haven't been doing that as much as I would like.

1:23:50.700 --> 1:23:55.700
 That's because largely because I like sitting in silence

1:23:55.700 --> 1:23:59.700
 and enjoying the beauty that is just nature and life.

1:23:59.700 --> 1:24:01.700
 When there's people, there's people.

1:24:01.700 --> 1:24:02.700
 I love people.

1:24:02.700 --> 1:24:03.700
 I love everything.

1:24:03.700 --> 1:24:08.700
 So when you love everything, why go through hell to build a company?

1:24:08.700 --> 1:24:11.700
 Yeah, that's a valid question.

1:24:11.700 --> 1:24:14.700
 I mean, I think you have to have a really good reason for wanting to do it.

1:24:14.700 --> 1:24:16.700
 But then your heart calls you for the certain.

1:24:16.700 --> 1:24:19.700
 Sometimes you look out into the mountains and you say,

1:24:19.700 --> 1:24:23.700
 for some reason I long to go there even if it means leaving the tribe

1:24:23.700 --> 1:24:27.700
 and putting yourself in danger and doing stupid shit.

1:24:27.700 --> 1:24:31.700
 That's the human imperative for exploration.

1:24:31.700 --> 1:24:32.700
 Yeah, absolutely.

1:24:32.700 --> 1:24:38.700
 Like when we were talking about this idea of longing being like the source code of humanity,

1:24:38.700 --> 1:24:42.700
 I think that's also the source code of our creativity.

1:24:42.700 --> 1:24:44.700
 It's the same longing for Eden.

1:24:44.700 --> 1:24:48.700
 It's like you're always reaching for something that you want to get to

1:24:48.700 --> 1:24:50.700
 or that you want to build.

1:24:50.700 --> 1:24:52.700
 It's the best of us.

1:24:52.700 --> 1:24:55.700
 What do you think?

1:24:55.700 --> 1:24:59.700
 You write about creativity and sadness.

1:24:59.700 --> 1:25:05.700
 Practically speaking, how should we leverage sadness for creativity?

1:25:05.700 --> 1:25:09.700
 Is that sort of in the artist domain, in the writer's domain,

1:25:09.700 --> 1:25:12.700
 in the engineering domains and so on?

1:25:12.700 --> 1:25:17.700
 It's definitely in those domains, but it's in all domains.

1:25:17.700 --> 1:25:20.700
 We're all going to face pain in this life at some point,

1:25:20.700 --> 1:25:28.700
 and we all have the ability to weather it and withstand it and live with it for a bit

1:25:28.700 --> 1:25:34.700
 and then try to transform it into something that we find beautiful.

1:25:34.700 --> 1:25:43.700
 It's very easy to notice the grandeur of the painting hanging on the gallery wall

1:25:43.700 --> 1:25:48.700
 or the new company that's just been created, but it takes a thousand different forms.

1:25:48.700 --> 1:25:53.700
 You could bake a cake or in the wake of the pandemic,

1:25:53.700 --> 1:25:56.700
 we've had more people applying to medical school and nursing school,

1:25:56.700 --> 1:26:02.700
 and after 9.11, you had people applying for jobs as firefighters and teachers.

1:26:02.700 --> 1:26:07.700
 So there's something in the human spirit that takes pain and turns it into meaning

1:26:07.700 --> 1:26:09.700
 when we're at our best.

1:26:09.700 --> 1:26:12.700
 And when we're not at our best, we deny the pain

1:26:12.700 --> 1:26:15.700
 and then take it out on ourselves and on other people.

1:26:15.700 --> 1:26:18.700
 So there's a kind of fork in the road of what to do with it.

1:26:18.700 --> 1:26:22.700
 But we know, I mean, there's all these studies that I go through in the book.

1:26:22.700 --> 1:26:29.700
 There was one where the researchers had people watch different movies,

1:26:29.700 --> 1:26:32.700
 like happy movies, sad movies, bittersweet movies,

1:26:32.700 --> 1:26:35.700
 and they found when people watched Father of the Bride,

1:26:35.700 --> 1:26:41.700
 which is like the ultimate bittersweet, you're walking your daughter down the aisle kind of feeling,

1:26:41.700 --> 1:26:46.700
 that was, they would give them creativity tasks after watching these different movies,

1:26:46.700 --> 1:26:50.700
 and the people who had been primed for bittersweetness were the most creative.

1:26:50.700 --> 1:26:55.700
 They were like primed to remember finality, you know, like love and finality, basically.

1:26:55.700 --> 1:26:58.700
 Love and impermanence.

1:26:58.700 --> 1:27:03.700
 There's something about that that gets us to our most beautiful state.

1:27:03.700 --> 1:27:06.700
 I wonder if it is, I mean, there's studies like that, there's a,

1:27:06.700 --> 1:27:09.700
 I don't know if you looked into terror management theory.

1:27:09.700 --> 1:27:11.700
 Yeah, that's really interesting stuff.

1:27:11.700 --> 1:27:19.700
 So they, especially intensely, have you focused on not just sad but traumatic, like death,

1:27:19.700 --> 1:27:23.700
 prime you with death and see how that changes your mind.

1:27:23.700 --> 1:27:27.700
 Like both, like, I don't know if there's creativity studies,

1:27:27.700 --> 1:27:35.700
 but they have interesting, I think a little bit tainted by political bias, but maybe not.

1:27:35.700 --> 1:27:41.700
 Psychology is a complicated field, but they study like who are you likely to vote for,

1:27:41.700 --> 1:27:45.700
 if you're primed by existential, like by thinking about death.

1:27:45.700 --> 1:27:46.700
 Like the fear of mortality.

1:27:46.700 --> 1:27:47.700
 Fear of mortality.

1:27:47.700 --> 1:27:49.700
 I forget what the conclusions are, but.

1:27:49.700 --> 1:27:52.700
 I think they find that people become more tribalistic.

1:27:52.700 --> 1:27:53.700
 Yeah.

1:27:53.700 --> 1:27:58.700
 You know, like there was one study where they found that after they primed people that way,

1:27:58.700 --> 1:28:03.700
 that they would then give them the chance to put hot sauce on a meal

1:28:03.700 --> 1:28:05.700
 that their political opponents were going to be eating,

1:28:05.700 --> 1:28:11.700
 and they put way too much hot sauce on after they've been primed to worry about death.

1:28:11.700 --> 1:28:15.700
 I think at the core, we're simple creatures.

1:28:15.700 --> 1:28:21.700
 So I actually, like in the book, I spent a bunch of time with people who are working on

1:28:21.700 --> 1:28:25.700
 radical life extension, you know, or the quest to live forever.

1:28:25.700 --> 1:28:30.700
 And people ask them a lot questions like, you know, the kinds of questions you were talking about earlier.

1:28:30.700 --> 1:28:33.700
 Like how are you going to feed everybody and how is there going to be space for everybody

1:28:33.700 --> 1:28:36.700
 if everyone really could live forever?

1:28:36.700 --> 1:28:38.700
 And what about conflict?

1:28:38.700 --> 1:28:40.700
 Won't we have an intensified conflict?

1:28:40.700 --> 1:28:45.700
 And their answer to that is they point to terror management theory.

1:28:45.700 --> 1:28:49.700
 You know, and they say because it's the fear of death,

1:28:49.700 --> 1:28:52.700
 they're basically saying it's the fear of death that are causing our conflicts in the first place.

1:28:52.700 --> 1:28:58.700
 And that if we remove the fear of death, we'd have less conflict to contend with.

1:28:58.700 --> 1:29:00.700
 And that, I don't really buy that.

1:29:00.700 --> 1:29:05.700
 It's possible that that's true, but are you also, how does the expression go,

1:29:05.700 --> 1:29:07.700
 throwing out the baby with the bathwater?

1:29:07.700 --> 1:29:16.700
 Are you also going to remove basically any source of meaning and happiness in the human condition?

1:29:16.700 --> 1:29:22.700
 Like it's very possible that death is fundamental to the human condition, the finality.

1:29:22.700 --> 1:29:25.700
 Yeah, that's the great philosophical question.

1:29:25.700 --> 1:29:29.700
 And I went to a conference of people who are working on this,

1:29:29.700 --> 1:29:33.700
 and I thought that they were going to be talking about those questions all through the conference.

1:29:33.700 --> 1:29:41.700
 But the MO is much more like we're so happy that we're here with people who have gotten past all those quibbles.

1:29:41.700 --> 1:29:44.700
 You know, we just know there's going to be meaning no matter what.

1:29:44.700 --> 1:29:50.700
 The basic assumption is let's try to extend life indefinitely,

1:29:50.700 --> 1:29:53.700
 and then we'll figure out if that's a good decision.

1:29:53.700 --> 1:29:55.700
 Or more like we're sure it's a good decision.

1:29:55.700 --> 1:29:58.700
 Or at least that was what I felt.

1:29:58.700 --> 1:30:04.700
 It's either we're sure it's a good decision,

1:30:04.700 --> 1:30:08.700
 or we're sure that it's good to believe that it's a good decision.

1:30:08.700 --> 1:30:14.700
 Meaning like there's no downside to that, even if we find out it's wrong.

1:30:14.700 --> 1:30:16.700
 But yes, there's a kind of certainty.

1:30:16.700 --> 1:30:19.700
 Obviously you want to extend human life, that's the kind of assumption.

1:30:19.700 --> 1:30:25.700
 That always seemed, now it could be true,

1:30:25.700 --> 1:30:33.700
 but just like the people who over focus on colonizing other planets,

1:30:33.700 --> 1:30:40.700
 it feels like you neglect the beauty and the struggle of our life here on Earth.

1:30:40.700 --> 1:30:42.700
 I have sort of the same kind of criticism,

1:30:42.700 --> 1:30:46.700
 whether it's thinking about Valhalla or any other afterlife,

1:30:46.700 --> 1:30:55.700
 is you can have, if you're not careful, forget to make this life a great one.

1:30:55.700 --> 1:30:57.700
 Whatever happens afterwards.

1:30:57.700 --> 1:30:58.700
 So yeah, definitely.

1:30:58.700 --> 1:31:01.700
 But from an engineering, from a biology, from a chemistry perspective,

1:31:01.700 --> 1:31:05.700
 it's very interesting to think how do we extend this thing.

1:31:05.700 --> 1:31:09.700
 Because it does seem that nature, the way it designed living organisms,

1:31:09.700 --> 1:31:12.700
 it really wants us to die.

1:31:12.700 --> 1:31:15.700
 Because that's part of the selection mechanism.

1:31:15.700 --> 1:31:18.700
 This part seems to be fundamental to evolution.

1:31:18.700 --> 1:31:23.700
 It gets people young, they need protection.

1:31:23.700 --> 1:31:26.700
 Once they're a young brain, they get to explore a lot,

1:31:26.700 --> 1:31:29.700
 get to figure out the world, they come up with their own novel ideas,

1:31:29.700 --> 1:31:33.700
 how to adapt and how to respond to that world.

1:31:33.700 --> 1:31:38.700
 And then as they get older and older, they get like stubborn and stuck in their ways.

1:31:38.700 --> 1:31:46.700
 So we need them to die so we make room for new life that's able to adapt to the changing environment.

1:31:46.700 --> 1:31:51.700
 If the old doesn't die, then you're going to get stale

1:31:51.700 --> 1:31:55.700
 and not be adaptable to the changing environment.

1:31:55.700 --> 1:31:57.700
 But maybe it doesn't have to happen so soon.

1:31:57.700 --> 1:31:59.700
 Yeah, maybe it doesn't.

1:31:59.700 --> 1:32:06.700
 Listen, I'm a big fan of pressing snooze on the alarm clock in the same way.

1:32:06.700 --> 1:32:13.700
 I'm one of the people that believe it's, or I don't definitely believe,

1:32:13.700 --> 1:32:22.700
 of course, I don't know, but I think death is a fundamental part of life.

1:32:22.700 --> 1:32:27.700
 But yeah, if I'm on my deathbed, I would sure as hell press snooze as many times as possible.

1:32:27.700 --> 1:32:29.700
 Yeah, I know.

1:32:29.700 --> 1:32:33.700
 And it's interesting because in some ways I share your instinct.

1:32:33.700 --> 1:32:38.700
 There was one scientist who I spoke to at that conference, he's one of the leading advocates,

1:32:38.700 --> 1:32:45.700
 and he said, you know, that's a story that we've invented for ourselves because we have no choice.

1:32:45.700 --> 1:32:50.700
 And if you really believe that you have no choice, then it's adaptive to tell that story,

1:32:50.700 --> 1:32:52.700
 that death gives meaning to life.

1:32:52.700 --> 1:32:53.700
 Good point.

1:32:53.700 --> 1:32:59.700
 But if you really think you could triumph over it, would you still be telling that same story?

1:32:59.700 --> 1:33:02.700
 And I've been thinking about that question ever since.

1:33:02.700 --> 1:33:05.700
 Yeah, yeah, no, they got a good point.

1:33:05.700 --> 1:33:06.700
 They got a good point.

1:33:06.700 --> 1:33:11.700
 No matter what, as an engineer in the scientific pursuits, it's a beautiful one.

1:33:11.700 --> 1:33:14.700
 In your own personal life, if we can go there.

1:33:14.700 --> 1:33:15.700
 Sure.

1:33:15.700 --> 1:33:19.700
 What have been some dark places you've gone in your own mind?

1:33:19.700 --> 1:33:30.700
 Grief, loss, sad moments, moments of sadness that have made you a better writer,

1:33:30.700 --> 1:33:33.700
 a better creator, a better human being?

1:33:33.700 --> 1:33:39.700
 Well, I mean, I've been through a lot of bereavement just in these last couple of years with COVID,

1:33:39.700 --> 1:33:45.700
 but even before that, I mean, there's all kinds of stuff.

1:33:45.700 --> 1:33:50.700
 I write about it in the book, and in some ways I feel like I can write about those kinds of things

1:33:50.700 --> 1:33:52.700
 better than I can speak them.

1:33:52.700 --> 1:34:01.700
 But I had a really complicated relationship with my mother growing up where we had a kind of Garden of Eden

1:34:01.700 --> 1:34:02.700
 during my childhood.

1:34:02.700 --> 1:34:05.700
 We were intensely, intensely close.

1:34:05.700 --> 1:34:20.700
 And my mother, because of some vulnerabilities that she had, reacted with a lot of trouble to my adolescence

1:34:20.700 --> 1:34:27.700
 and to growing independent from her and starting to have different religious views and different political views

1:34:27.700 --> 1:34:29.700
 and all kinds of things.

1:34:29.700 --> 1:34:41.700
 And we had a pretty intense break that I describe in the book, and it was so intense that even though after that

1:34:41.700 --> 1:34:47.700
 we still would get together for holidays and talk to each other on the phone and all that,

1:34:47.700 --> 1:34:51.700
 there was a sense in which it was over at that point.

1:34:51.700 --> 1:34:53.700
 The relationship was over.

1:34:53.700 --> 1:34:55.700
 The Garden of Eden was no more.

1:34:55.700 --> 1:34:56.700
 Yeah, yeah.

1:34:56.700 --> 1:35:05.700
 It was like a feeling of like, yeah, I know what Eden was like, and it's not there anymore.

1:35:05.700 --> 1:35:10.700
 And I think it was all the more confusing because if you lose someone to actual bereavement,

1:35:10.700 --> 1:35:15.700
 you go through a mourning process, and people have thought for thousands of years about how to do that.

1:35:15.700 --> 1:35:20.700
 But with something like this, there's no process because you're not even admitting to yourself,

1:35:20.700 --> 1:35:27.700
 especially when you're in your teens and 20s, that you're mourning something.

1:35:27.700 --> 1:35:34.700
 But it was the case that for decades, for decades, I could not answer even the simplest question about my mother,

1:35:34.700 --> 1:35:42.700
 like where did she grow up, without tears in my eyes, or more than tears in my eyes, like embarrassing tears.

1:35:42.700 --> 1:35:47.700
 So I would just try to steer the subject in another place.

1:35:47.700 --> 1:35:50.700
 But I will say two things happened.

1:35:50.700 --> 1:35:59.700
 One is that I've spent the last six, seven years writing this book about joy and sorrow and loss and love and all of it,

1:35:59.700 --> 1:36:02.700
 and I've really come to terms with all of it.

1:36:02.700 --> 1:36:07.700
 And then the second thing that happened is my mother now has Alzheimer's.

1:36:07.700 --> 1:36:15.700
 And in her Alzheimer's, she's still actually the same person, like she's forgotten most things,

1:36:15.700 --> 1:36:20.700
 but she still has these conversational lanes that you can travel down that are like the way she always was.

1:36:20.700 --> 1:36:28.700
 And the way that she was when I was a kid, which was like so incredibly loving and so connected

1:36:28.700 --> 1:36:35.700
 and so warm and sweet and funny and all of it, all the things I remembered, like it's all come back.

1:36:35.700 --> 1:36:45.700
 And for all these decades, I had been wondering whether that Garden of Eden I remembered had actually happened,

1:36:45.700 --> 1:36:52.700
 or whether that was just like the fantasy of a child, and maybe it was always difficult and I had not seen it.

1:36:52.700 --> 1:36:59.700
 But I'm seeing her now, and I realize that it was all true, everything I remember, it was all true.

1:36:59.700 --> 1:37:04.700
 It all happened, because it's happening again.

1:37:04.700 --> 1:37:08.700
 And you return to the Garden of Eden for a time.

1:37:08.700 --> 1:37:09.700
 Yeah.

1:37:09.700 --> 1:37:14.700
 And to childhood. It's always a question of whether you can return to that place.

1:37:14.700 --> 1:37:21.700
 Well, I don't know. I don't even know if I'd say I've returned, because I'm a different person now, and I don't need her.

1:37:21.700 --> 1:37:22.700
 Are you sure?

1:37:22.700 --> 1:37:23.700
 Yeah.

1:37:23.700 --> 1:37:29.700
 So you're different than the 10 year old? You feel different?

1:37:29.700 --> 1:37:38.700
 No, I mean, I'm the same person in terms of my need for love and love of love and all of that, but I don't look,

1:37:38.700 --> 1:37:43.700
 I'm not dependent on my mother for it the way I was then, and that makes the experience really different.

1:37:43.700 --> 1:37:48.700
 Yeah, when you're younger, she's a god figure.

1:37:48.700 --> 1:37:54.700
 What is that, that the roots, the parents, such a funny civilization will live.

1:37:54.700 --> 1:38:02.700
 And there's a depth of connection to parents that's probably more powerful than anything else in terms of its formative effect on who you are.

1:38:02.700 --> 1:38:10.700
 I think it's the most powerful. And in fact, when this started happening, I got to college and I took a class in creative writing,

1:38:10.700 --> 1:38:15.700
 and I tried to write a story, a fictionalized version of what was happening.

1:38:15.700 --> 1:38:19.700
 And I called it The Most Passionate Love, because of what you just said.

1:38:19.700 --> 1:38:20.700
 Yeah.

1:38:20.700 --> 1:38:28.700
 And the teacher actually said to me, she was like, you know, you should put this story in a drawer and not take it out again for 30 years because you're way too close to it.

1:38:28.700 --> 1:38:29.700
 Yeah.

1:38:29.700 --> 1:38:36.700
 So I've now finally written it 30 years later.

1:38:36.700 --> 1:38:40.700
 Yeah, you're probably still too close to it though.

1:38:40.700 --> 1:38:53.700
 I don't know, though. I mean, I do think everybody goes through experiences in this life where you're experiencing a fundamental pain of separation and desire for a union.

1:38:53.700 --> 1:38:58.700
 And it takes so many different forms. And this was my primal form of it.

1:38:58.700 --> 1:39:07.700
 But for someone else, it's a betrayal or a bereavement or an exile from a country of their birth or whatever it is.

1:39:07.700 --> 1:39:11.700
 And then you get to solve that puzzle for the rest of your life.

1:39:11.700 --> 1:39:29.700
 Yeah, the fact of like, I really do believe that the original love that we long for, like that one of the great things that you learn as you grow older is that the love exists in some plane that's more general than the particularized form in which you first knew it.

1:39:29.700 --> 1:39:42.700
 Yeah, I mean, that's why, despite all the creepy interpretations, even though Sigmund Freud is probably wrong in the details, he was the first one to sort of suggest that our experiences...

1:39:42.700 --> 1:39:53.700
 I mean, he said that that was really controversial at the time when young people, they start having sexual thoughts like at age two or something, whatever the hell he said.

1:39:53.700 --> 1:40:00.700
 So you develop this kind of connection to the opposite sex or whatever, to your mother, to your parents.

1:40:00.700 --> 1:40:22.700
 And I think while a lot of that is shown to be probably not true, what is like a deeper truth there is your first early experiences of love or depth of connection are probably somehow strongly formative of your conception of love and your definition of the perfect thing you're reaching for for the rest of your life.

1:40:22.700 --> 1:40:29.700
 Yeah, I think that's right. And you can really see it when you become a parent, too. You know, you can just see like, there's...

1:40:29.700 --> 1:40:31.700
 Don't screw it up.

1:40:31.700 --> 1:40:49.700
 You know, I have to say, like, I mean, knock on wood, I actually feel like, like, we're doing pretty well. Like, my kids are teenagers now. And I really had thought that I wasn't going to repeat the issues that I had been through with my mom. And I can say, I really am not.

1:40:49.700 --> 1:40:58.700
 Yeah, like, my mom, for various reasons, just had a lot of trouble with my independence. And I just don't feel that at all. So...

1:40:58.700 --> 1:41:03.700
 Yeah, there might be other things you're totally blind to.

1:41:03.700 --> 1:41:04.700
 I guess that's possible.

1:41:04.700 --> 1:41:08.700
 Isn't that the way of parenting? You solve the problems of the past.

1:41:08.700 --> 1:41:14.700
 But there's some other new one. I guess I'll find out in 10 or 20 years. But like, so far, so good.

1:41:14.700 --> 1:41:20.700
 What wisdom about parenting can you give from your own experience and from your writing?

1:41:20.700 --> 1:41:47.700
 Yeah, well, oh my god, there's a lot to say. So, on the bittersweet side of things, the wisdom that I would give is that, especially for kids who are growing up in relative comfort with everything going pretty well, they get the idea that real life is when things are going well.

1:41:47.700 --> 1:41:55.700
 And when things don't go well, it's like a detour from the main road, as opposed to understanding that it's all the main road.

1:41:55.700 --> 1:42:03.700
 And I tell this story in the book of this time that we went on this family vacation where we rented a house in the countryside.

1:42:03.700 --> 1:42:10.700
 And the house was next to this field where lived two donkeys that our kids fell in love with.

1:42:10.700 --> 1:42:18.700
 They were like really little at the time, two boys. And they're spending all this time feeding carrots to the donkeys and it's all beautiful.

1:42:18.700 --> 1:42:24.700
 And then comes the day where they realize that we're leaving in like two days and they're never going to see these donkeys again.

1:42:24.700 --> 1:42:36.700
 And they start crying themselves to sleep. And the usual things that parents might say at a moment like that of like, you know, maybe we'll come back or another family will feed them, will feed these donkeys.

1:42:36.700 --> 1:42:48.700
 None of that made any difference. But when we said to them, you know, goodbye is part of life and this feeling you're having, everybody has it.

1:42:48.700 --> 1:42:57.700
 You've had it before. You're going to have it again. You'll feel better in a couple of days. But this is the way it's supposed to be. This is natural.

1:42:57.700 --> 1:43:03.700
 That's when they stopped crying because I think that's when they stopped resisting.

1:43:03.700 --> 1:43:10.700
 Like it's one thing to feel the pain of goodbye and it's another thing to be feeling like this isn't supposed to be happening.

1:43:10.700 --> 1:43:19.700
 It's the resistance part of this isn't supposed to be happening that makes life really difficult as opposed to a more clear eyed view of what it really is.

1:43:19.700 --> 1:43:24.700
 This is indeed supposed to be happening. There's a show called Yellowstone that I recently started watching.

1:43:24.700 --> 1:43:29.700
 Yeah, no, I've heard of it. We actually started watching it, but only a few minutes and didn't get into it.

1:43:29.700 --> 1:43:39.700
 So there's just a quick, it's not a spoiler of any kind, but there's a father taking out the son for the first time to go hunting and to shoot their first buck.

1:43:39.700 --> 1:43:45.700
 And the son is getting really sad because he pulls the trigger and he took a life.

1:43:45.700 --> 1:43:56.700
 And the father says that everybody gets killed in this life. That's the way of nature. That's the way each one of us is going to get killed.

1:43:56.700 --> 1:44:11.700
 And it's interesting because I didn't really think of it that way because you think you die, but he really framed it as killed because he's like, there's no such thing as dying of old age.

1:44:11.700 --> 1:44:25.700
 Let's medically, let's discuss that a bit, but basically there's something, whether it's a truck or a bacteria, something's going to kill you in the end.

1:44:25.700 --> 1:44:33.700
 And that was an interesting way to look at it because we tend to think of humans aren't supposed to be killed.

1:44:33.700 --> 1:44:38.700
 We think of murder as one of the sins, sort of one of the things that you don't do in society.

1:44:38.700 --> 1:44:45.700
 But you know what? We do, that's a more technical discussion, whether we ultimately get killed by something in the end.

1:44:45.700 --> 1:44:53.700
 But to some degree that's true, at least for most of us, that there's something that gets us, whether it's cancer, those kinds of things. It's interesting.

1:44:53.700 --> 1:44:59.700
 But yeah, it's that reframing of it's not, it's supposed to be, this is the way of the world.

1:44:59.700 --> 1:45:07.700
 Yeah. So it's funny. I mean, you know, at the same time that I just wrote a whole book about the fact that this is the way it is, like I really do believe this is the way it is.

1:45:07.700 --> 1:45:12.700
 And with this reality, there's an intense beauty that comes along with it.

1:45:12.700 --> 1:45:16.700
 So we have to accept the reality to get to the beauty. I believe that.

1:45:16.700 --> 1:45:23.700
 And at the same time, there's a part of me that's just like, yeah, but give me the magic wand to make the world different.

1:45:23.700 --> 1:45:26.700
 Yeah. Yeah.

1:45:26.700 --> 1:45:29.700
 I don't know. I don't know how much of this is a female thing, too.

1:45:29.700 --> 1:45:37.700
 Like I was watching with my son, my 12 year old the other day, we were watching this show about the battle of Thermopylae.

1:45:37.700 --> 1:45:42.700
 And it was like all about, you know, valor and glory on the battlefield.

1:45:42.700 --> 1:45:54.700
 And I said to him something like, gosh, don't you just wish we lived in a world where you didn't have to do all this in order for everyone just to live their lives?

1:45:54.700 --> 1:45:57.700
 And he just looked at me completely puzzled.

1:45:57.700 --> 1:46:03.700
 Like, no, you know, like to him, it all just seemed self evident that the world would be structured that way.

1:46:03.700 --> 1:46:09.700
 You know, and he had like the 12 year old admiration for the valor of it all.

1:46:09.700 --> 1:46:16.700
 But you wonder if that's nature or nurture.

1:46:16.700 --> 1:46:20.700
 I wonder what that world looks like.

1:46:20.700 --> 1:46:26.700
 We do live in a world where murder is seen as bad, but you look at a lot of the human history.

1:46:26.700 --> 1:46:30.700
 I don't know if they had the same kind of conception of that.

1:46:30.700 --> 1:46:41.700
 In terms of, you have to ask what kind of murder, you know, for what purpose, you know, war was a way of life.

1:46:41.700 --> 1:46:42.700
 It's interesting.

1:46:42.700 --> 1:46:53.700
 It's interesting if we can imagine properly a future that is different than ours in terms of operating under different moral systems.

1:46:53.700 --> 1:47:01.700
 I'd like the same with living indefinitely or living in a society with no war.

1:47:01.700 --> 1:47:03.700
 Like how fundamental is war?

1:47:03.700 --> 1:47:05.700
 How fundamental is death?

1:47:05.700 --> 1:47:08.700
 I mean, I think it's so fundamental to our source code.

1:47:08.700 --> 1:47:11.700
 I just wish that our source code were different, basically.

1:47:11.700 --> 1:47:14.700
 Like I can't get past that wish.

1:47:14.700 --> 1:47:18.700
 There's brain computer interfaces that try to merge.

1:47:18.700 --> 1:47:26.700
 We have smartphones, we're already kind of cyborgs, but greater and greater merger of computational power.

1:47:26.700 --> 1:47:30.700
 So literally adding source code to our original source code.

1:47:30.700 --> 1:47:41.700
 There's the mushy biology that runs source code, and then there's more cold electrical systems, and then they integrate together.

1:47:41.700 --> 1:47:51.700
 And eventually, one day we offload the magic that is human consciousness also into the machine, and then we'll get to see.

1:47:51.700 --> 1:47:55.700
 Maybe they'll be a little bit less assholish about the whole war thing.

1:47:55.700 --> 1:47:57.700
 That'd be more.

1:47:57.700 --> 1:48:09.700
 But there is, I think, even when I think about engineering human intelligence or superhuman intelligence systems, I feel like they also need to have the yin and yang of life.

1:48:09.700 --> 1:48:14.700
 They have to be able to be afraid and to be sad and all those kinds of things.

1:48:14.700 --> 1:48:19.700
 But maybe it's because I'm a product in this particular environment.

1:48:19.700 --> 1:48:25.700
 Maybe sadness is a useful human invention, but not a universal one.

1:48:25.700 --> 1:48:40.700
 This is what I don't know, because this is where I come back to, as I told you, the original reason that I wrote my whole book was the feeling that somehow in the expression of sad music is what other people see when they talk about God.

1:48:40.700 --> 1:48:48.700
 Like there's something so, there's like an ultimate beauty there that I don't know if we have access to without that.

1:48:48.700 --> 1:48:50.700
 But maybe we do.

1:48:50.700 --> 1:48:54.700
 But I can say in this world, that's a great way to get access to that state.

1:48:54.700 --> 1:48:58.700
 Is it within the reach of science to deeply understand this, you think?

1:48:58.700 --> 1:49:01.700
 To understand why you feel sad when you're listening to a song?

1:49:01.700 --> 1:49:04.700
 Or why you feel so much love when you're listening to a sad song.

1:49:04.700 --> 1:49:06.700
 To a sad song, right.

1:49:06.700 --> 1:49:16.700
 Why the sad song opens up some kind of deep connection to something you can call divine or something, whatever the heck that is.

1:49:16.700 --> 1:49:18.700
 Yeah, I do think.

1:49:18.700 --> 1:49:26.700
 I mean, we have like really early signs of it from the research, and I'm sure we're just at the scratching the surface stage.

1:49:26.700 --> 1:49:35.700
 But I mean, like we know, for example, that the vagus nerve, which is so fundamental that it governs our breathing and our digestion,

1:49:35.700 --> 1:49:40.700
 our vagus nerve also activates when we see another being in distress.

1:49:40.700 --> 1:49:45.700
 There's like an instinctive impulse to want to make it stop.

1:49:45.700 --> 1:49:53.700
 And the theory is that that's an evolutionary design because we had to be able to respond to the cries of our infants.

1:49:53.700 --> 1:49:59.700
 You know, and from that ability grows the greater ability to respond to other people's cries too.

1:49:59.700 --> 1:50:08.700
 So that's probably just, you know, like the very first step in being able to understand what all that is.

1:50:08.700 --> 1:50:17.700
 You've already given plenty of advice, but broadly, what advice would you give to young folks today about career, about life?

1:50:17.700 --> 1:50:24.700
 Whether they want to be writers, lawyers, scientists, musicians and artists, whatever the heck they want to be.

1:50:24.700 --> 1:50:27.700
 How can they live a life they can be proud of?

1:50:27.700 --> 1:50:32.700
 Okay, here's what I think.

1:50:32.700 --> 1:50:42.700
 You should absolutely do that thing that you're dying to do, but you should always have a plan B,

1:50:42.700 --> 1:50:47.700
 like a backup plan and a way of earning a living no matter what happens.

1:50:47.700 --> 1:51:01.700
 Because I feel like people, we have this narrative in our culture of like the glamorous thing is to figure out the thing you love and then risk everything to achieve that.

1:51:01.700 --> 1:51:05.700
 But first of all, a lot of people aren't comfortable with that level of risk.

1:51:05.700 --> 1:51:10.700
 And second, when you're living with that level of risk, that's a cognitive load too.

1:51:10.700 --> 1:51:18.700
 And so you don't have the full emotion and heart to be able to focus on the thing that you actually really love because you're like stressed out about it.

1:51:18.700 --> 1:51:23.700
 So I'd say like, get the backup plan in place and then do the thing.

1:51:23.700 --> 1:51:25.700
 My advice would be the opposite.

1:51:25.700 --> 1:51:27.700
 Okay, tell me why.

1:51:27.700 --> 1:51:37.700
 Well, I think the best, the truth is be aware of the cost not having a plan B has.

1:51:37.700 --> 1:51:39.700
 So do it deliberately if you don't.

1:51:39.700 --> 1:51:44.700
 But I'm with Bukowski on find what you love and let it kill you.

1:51:44.700 --> 1:51:47.700
 I think you have to actually know your personality.

1:51:47.700 --> 1:51:56.700
 I know if I have a plan B, I will not try as hard on plan A and I would likely take plan B.

1:51:56.700 --> 1:52:04.700
 Because if plan A is the risky thing, I just work much better when in the state of desperation.

1:52:04.700 --> 1:52:08.700
 So with my back against the wall and you have to know that about yourself, I think that has to do with...

1:52:08.700 --> 1:52:14.700
 So I think we can refine it to say you actually have to really know yourself and how you respond to different kinds of risk.

1:52:14.700 --> 1:52:17.700
 Like I would not do well in that kind of situation.

1:52:17.700 --> 1:52:20.700
 I'd be like up at two in the morning worrying about it.

1:52:20.700 --> 1:52:31.700
 Whereas if I have some, like it doesn't have to be paying the rent in some grand way, but if there's some basic way of paying the rent, then my heart's free to do the thing I really love.

1:52:31.700 --> 1:52:32.700
 That's hilarious.

1:52:32.700 --> 1:52:39.700
 For me, the only way I'm free is when I don't know how I'm going to pay the rent.

1:52:39.700 --> 1:52:40.700
 Huh.

1:52:40.700 --> 1:52:49.700
 Yeah, because otherwise I'll find a way to pay the rent that's not at all a source of deep fulfillment for me.

1:52:49.700 --> 1:52:50.700
 I see.

1:52:50.700 --> 1:52:53.700
 So it's like if you don't have like the, what's the expression?

1:52:53.700 --> 1:52:55.700
 I don't know, something like the dog at your back.

1:52:55.700 --> 1:52:56.700
 Yeah, deadlines.

1:52:56.700 --> 1:52:57.700
 Then you won't actually do it.

1:52:57.700 --> 1:53:01.700
 I create real or artificial deadlines, anxiety and so on.

1:53:01.700 --> 1:53:04.700
 So yeah, you have to know yourself.

1:53:04.700 --> 1:53:06.700
 Yeah, so really the advice is know your triggers.

1:53:06.700 --> 1:53:14.700
 But we're still saying the same basic thing of like do the thing you really love, but just set up the rest of your life.

1:53:14.700 --> 1:53:16.700
 Strategize appropriately to your personality and triggers.

1:53:16.700 --> 1:53:18.700
 Exactly, exactly.

1:53:18.700 --> 1:53:21.700
 What do you think is the meaning of life?

1:53:21.700 --> 1:53:30.700
 The meaning of this whole thing probably has something to do with whatever we feel when we listen to a sad song.

1:53:30.700 --> 1:53:39.700
 Yeah, because two things come simultaneously to my mind when you ask that question, and I've been asking it since I was four.

1:53:39.700 --> 1:53:42.700
 I remember the first time I did.

1:53:42.700 --> 1:53:44.700
 The question is more important than the answer probably.

1:53:44.700 --> 1:53:45.700
 Yeah.

1:53:45.700 --> 1:53:46.700
 Just keep asking.

1:53:46.700 --> 1:53:51.700
 I don't know, the first one is beauty and I don't know why beauty is so important, but I just know that it is.

1:53:51.700 --> 1:53:54.700
 And impossible to define perhaps.

1:53:54.700 --> 1:53:55.700
 Is it definable?

1:53:55.700 --> 1:53:57.700
 Yeah.

1:53:57.700 --> 1:53:59.700
 Other than you know it when you see it.

1:53:59.700 --> 1:54:02.700
 I don't know, I mean just.

1:54:02.700 --> 1:54:08.700
 It has to do with that line that you feel something when you just see it or you hear it.

1:54:08.700 --> 1:54:22.700
 Yeah, you just see it and it's like whatever can deliver you to that mode of transcendence where you're no longer purely in your own self and you're in something higher.

1:54:22.700 --> 1:54:39.700
 And when you're in those states of mind, you know it because you have the temporary sensation that you could die at that moment, that the people you love could die and it will all be okay because there's something else.

1:54:39.700 --> 1:54:41.700
 So that's my first answer.

1:54:41.700 --> 1:54:48.700
 And then my second answer is the need to relieve psychic pain, like other people's psychic pain.

1:54:48.700 --> 1:54:51.700
 I don't know why that's just like an impulse that I have.

1:54:51.700 --> 1:54:55.700
 Psychic pain is more like suffering of any form.

1:54:55.700 --> 1:54:58.700
 Yeah, but I mean.

1:54:58.700 --> 1:54:59.700
 Is there a particular.

1:54:59.700 --> 1:55:09.700
 Yeah, just making the world better and less pain, less pain to go around in general.

1:55:09.700 --> 1:55:19.700
 Hence your sort of optimistic desire and longing for a world without sort of destruction, without malevolent destruction.

1:55:19.700 --> 1:55:21.700
 A world where that wouldn't be necessary.

1:55:21.700 --> 1:55:23.700
 Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

1:55:23.700 --> 1:55:27.700
 But yeah, like I so I had this moment.

1:55:27.700 --> 1:55:33.700
 It wasn't so long ago I was doing some interview and somebody asked me, like, what are you longing for right now?

1:55:33.700 --> 1:55:37.700
 And my answer at that moment was like, you know what?

1:55:37.700 --> 1:55:41.700
 I'm actually at this moment in life where I'm not longing for anything.

1:55:41.700 --> 1:55:46.700
 I'm at this particular way station where everything is the way I want it to be.

1:55:46.700 --> 1:55:52.700
 And of course, the minute you say something like that, you know, you're going to be proven wrong.

1:55:52.700 --> 1:55:58.700
 Because like an hour later, I get a letter from a reader who I've been in touch with over the years.

1:55:58.700 --> 1:56:03.700
 And he was telling me about like a psychic struggle that he's going through.

1:56:03.700 --> 1:56:13.700
 And I just felt like, oh, my gosh, if there were anything I could do to make it that his life wouldn't have been such that he would be in this position in the first place.

1:56:13.700 --> 1:56:18.700
 And the struggles had to do with a long life history.

1:56:18.700 --> 1:56:21.700
 So I don't know why I feel that so intensely, but I do.

1:56:21.700 --> 1:56:26.700
 It's funny, those moments when you're just at peace, there's nothing else you want.

1:56:26.700 --> 1:56:30.700
 You feel like that's like a temporary repose, like a pause.

1:56:30.700 --> 1:56:32.700
 Exactly.

1:56:32.700 --> 1:56:39.700
 You bet your ass a desire follows that at some point, but you get to enjoy those little moments.

1:56:39.700 --> 1:56:43.700
 Yeah, and even when he asked me and I answered that way, I said, this is a way station.

1:56:43.700 --> 1:56:49.700
 Like I knew it was temporary, but I didn't realize it would be disrupted like an hour later.

1:56:49.700 --> 1:57:02.700
 And sort of to give you pushback to your statement about the possibility of beauty and basically alleviating suffering,

1:57:02.700 --> 1:57:06.700
 there's a quote I really like from Hunter S. Thompson that pushes back against that,

1:57:06.700 --> 1:57:14.700
 which is for every moment of triumph, for every instance of beauty, many souls must be trampled.

1:57:14.700 --> 1:57:19.700
 But that's a very Hunter S. Thompson, and you know how he ended up.

1:57:19.700 --> 1:57:26.700
 He's not the greatest philosopher of all times, but he's certainly a beautiful, a chaotic human being.

1:57:26.700 --> 1:57:27.700
 Well, that's true.

1:57:27.700 --> 1:57:32.700
 And I will tell you that my nickname for my husband is Gonzo, kind of because of him.

1:57:32.700 --> 1:57:39.700
 He invented that form of Gonzo journalism where the writer is totally in the story.

1:57:39.700 --> 1:57:41.700
 And my husband, that's his personality.

1:57:41.700 --> 1:57:43.700
 He's in everything that he does.

1:57:43.700 --> 1:57:44.700
 He's really in it.

1:57:44.700 --> 1:57:45.700
 He's really present.

1:57:45.700 --> 1:57:47.700
 He just lives that way.

1:57:47.700 --> 1:57:52.700
 So his name is Ken, but I call him Gonzo like 90% of the time.

1:57:52.700 --> 1:57:55.700
 Well, then that's a beautiful way to end the season.

1:57:55.700 --> 1:57:56.700
 Thank you for your work.

1:57:56.700 --> 1:57:58.700
 Thank you for being who you are.

1:57:58.700 --> 1:58:03.700
 Thank you for initially at least making me feel okay about being an introvert and educating

1:58:03.700 --> 1:58:06.700
 and making the rest of us feel great about being introverts.

1:58:06.700 --> 1:58:08.700
 It's like half the world or whatever the heck it is.

1:58:08.700 --> 1:58:11.700
 It's a lot of people.

1:58:11.700 --> 1:58:13.700
 Thank you for being you.

1:58:13.700 --> 1:58:14.700
 Thank you for talking today.

1:58:14.700 --> 1:58:15.700
 It was just awesome.

1:58:15.700 --> 1:58:16.700
 This was fun.

1:58:16.700 --> 1:58:17.700
 Thank you so much.

1:58:17.700 --> 1:58:18.700
 It was so great to talk to you.

1:58:18.700 --> 1:58:23.700
 And I think it was the, what I said to you when we first got connected is thank you for your way of being in the world.

1:58:23.700 --> 1:58:26.700
 I really, really love it.

1:58:26.700 --> 1:58:29.700
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Susan Cain.

1:58:29.700 --> 1:58:33.700
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

1:58:33.700 --> 1:58:37.700
 And now let me leave you with some words from Susan Cain herself.

1:58:37.700 --> 1:58:44.700
 The highly sensitive introvert tends to be philosophical or spiritual in their orientation,

1:58:44.700 --> 1:58:48.700
 rather than materialistic or hedonistic.

1:58:48.700 --> 1:58:50.700
 They dislike small talk.

1:58:50.700 --> 1:58:54.700
 They often describe themselves as creative or intuitive.

1:58:54.700 --> 1:58:58.700
 They dream vividly and can often recall their dreams the next day.

1:58:58.700 --> 1:59:03.700
 They love music, nature, art, and physical beauty.

1:59:03.700 --> 1:59:12.700
 They feel exceptionally strong emotions, sometimes acute bouts of joy, but also sorrow, melancholy, and fear.

1:59:12.700 --> 1:59:20.700
 Highly sensitive people also process information about their environments, both physical and emotional, unusually deeply.

1:59:20.700 --> 1:59:23.700
 They tend to notice subtleties that others miss.

1:59:23.700 --> 1:59:30.700
 One other person's shifted mood, or a light bulb burning a touch too brightly.

1:59:30.700 --> 1:59:53.700
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
