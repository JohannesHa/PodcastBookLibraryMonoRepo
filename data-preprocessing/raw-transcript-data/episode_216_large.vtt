00:00.000 --> 00:03.400
 The following is a conversation with Vincent Recaniello,

00:03.400 --> 00:08.120
 professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia.

00:08.120 --> 00:10.840
 Vincent is one of the best educators in biology

00:10.840 --> 00:12.520
 and in general that I've ever had

00:12.520 --> 00:14.360
 the pleasure of speaking with.

00:14.360 --> 00:16.120
 I highly recommend you check out

00:16.120 --> 00:19.040
 his This Week in Virology podcast

00:19.040 --> 00:22.520
 and watch his introductory lectures on YouTube.

00:22.520 --> 00:24.920
 In particular, the playlist I recommend

00:24.920 --> 00:28.720
 is called Virology Lectures 2021.

00:28.720 --> 00:30.040
 To support this podcast,

00:30.040 --> 00:32.720
 please check out the sponsors in the description.

00:33.640 --> 00:35.800
 As a side note, please allow me to say

00:35.800 --> 00:38.320
 a few words about the COVID vaccines.

00:38.320 --> 00:41.000
 Some people are scared of a virus hurting

00:41.000 --> 00:43.280
 or killing somebody they love.

00:43.280 --> 00:46.720
 Some are scared of their government betraying them,

00:46.720 --> 00:49.520
 their leaders blinded by power and greed.

00:50.360 --> 00:52.160
 I have both of these fears.

00:52.160 --> 00:57.160
 And two, I'm afraid, as FDR said, of fear itself.

00:57.160 --> 01:01.120
 Fear manifests as anger and anger leads to division

01:01.120 --> 01:03.200
 in the hands of charismatic leaders

01:03.200 --> 01:06.600
 who then manufacture truth in quotes

01:06.600 --> 01:10.160
 that maximize controversy and a sense of imminent crisis

01:10.160 --> 01:12.160
 that only they can save us from.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.920
 And though I'm sometimes mocked for this,

01:15.920 --> 01:20.520
 I still believe that love, compassion, empathy

01:20.520 --> 01:24.240
 is the way out from this vicious downward spiral of division.

01:24.240 --> 01:26.240
 I personally took the vaccine

01:26.240 --> 01:28.520
 based on my understanding of the data,

01:28.520 --> 01:30.880
 deciding that for me, the risk of negative effects

01:30.880 --> 01:33.840
 from COVID, short term and long term,

01:33.840 --> 01:36.200
 are far worse than the negative effects

01:36.200 --> 01:38.640
 from the mRNA vaccine.

01:38.640 --> 01:43.480
 I read, I thought, I decided, for me.

01:43.480 --> 01:47.280
 But I never have and never will talk down to people

01:47.280 --> 01:49.160
 who don't take the vaccine.

01:49.160 --> 01:52.480
 I'm humble enough to know just how little I know,

01:52.480 --> 01:55.480
 how wrong I have been and will be

01:55.480 --> 01:58.160
 on many of my beliefs and ideas.

01:58.160 --> 02:01.080
 I think dogmatic certainty and division

02:01.080 --> 02:04.720
 is more destructive in the long term than any virus.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.520
 The solution for me personally, like I said,

02:07.520 --> 02:09.600
 is to choose empathy and compassion

02:09.600 --> 02:12.360
 towards all fellow human beings,

02:12.360 --> 02:14.760
 no matter who they voted for.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.400
 I hope you do the same.

02:16.400 --> 02:19.880
 Read, think, and try to imagine

02:19.880 --> 02:22.840
 that what you currently think is the truth

02:22.840 --> 02:24.760
 may be totally wrong.

02:24.760 --> 02:27.760
 This mindset is one that opens you to discovery,

02:27.760 --> 02:29.520
 innovation, and wisdom.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.040
 I hope my conversation with Vincent Racanello

02:33.040 --> 02:36.080
 is a useful resource for just this kind of exploration.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.920
 He doesn't talk down to people

02:37.920 --> 02:40.400
 and he's the most knowledgeable virologist

02:40.400 --> 02:42.040
 I've ever spoken to.

02:42.040 --> 02:43.960
 He has no political agenda,

02:43.960 --> 02:47.200
 no desire to mock those who disagree with him.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.000
 He just loves biology

02:49.000 --> 02:51.280
 and explaining the fundamental mechanisms

02:51.280 --> 02:54.040
 of how biological systems work.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.720
 That's a great person to listen to

02:55.720 --> 02:58.040
 and learn from with an open mind.

02:58.040 --> 02:59.880
 I hope you join me in doing so,

02:59.880 --> 03:01.120
 and no matter what,

03:01.120 --> 03:03.760
 try to put more love out there in the world.

03:04.720 --> 03:06.560
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast

03:06.560 --> 03:10.000
 and here is my conversation with Vincent Racanello.

03:11.280 --> 03:14.480
 You mentioned in one of your lectures on virology

03:14.480 --> 03:16.040
 that there are more viruses

03:16.040 --> 03:17.880
 in a leader of coastal seawater

03:17.880 --> 03:19.600
 than people on earth.

03:20.560 --> 03:25.560
 In the Nature article titled Microbiology by Numbers,

03:25.560 --> 03:29.600
 it says there are 10 to the 31 viruses on earth.

03:29.600 --> 03:33.600
 Also it says that the rate of viral infection

03:33.600 --> 03:38.600
 in the ocean stands at 10 to the 23 infections per second.

03:39.200 --> 03:42.440
 And these infections remove 20 to 40%

03:42.440 --> 03:45.160
 of all bacterial cells each day.

03:45.160 --> 03:47.200
 There's a war going on.

03:47.200 --> 03:49.360
 Do you, what do you make of these numbers?

03:49.360 --> 03:52.400
 Or why are there so many viruses?

03:52.400 --> 03:54.600
 So the numbers you're quoting,

03:54.600 --> 03:57.920
 they're in my first virology lecture, right?

03:57.920 --> 04:00.720
 Because people don't know these numbers

04:00.720 --> 04:02.560
 and they get, whoa, they get wild by them.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.160
 So I love to give them.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.280
 So the way, sorry to interrupt.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.680
 As I was saying offline,

04:08.680 --> 04:12.320
 you have one of the best introductory lectures on virology

04:12.320 --> 04:14.760
 that I've ever seen, introductory lectures, period.

04:14.760 --> 04:16.680
 So I highly recommend people

04:16.680 --> 04:18.440
 find you on YouTube and watch it

04:18.440 --> 04:20.480
 if you're curious at all about viruses.

04:20.480 --> 04:24.920
 It, yeah, there's a lot of times throughout watching it,

04:24.920 --> 04:26.480
 I felt like, whoa.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.280
 Yeah, that's my goal is to work.

04:28.280 --> 04:29.800
 And that's what my students tell me.

04:29.800 --> 04:33.240
 One student once said, every day after every lecture,

04:33.240 --> 04:35.960
 I could go home and tell my roommate something

04:35.960 --> 04:38.840
 she didn't know and blew her away.

04:38.840 --> 04:42.080
 So the number of viruses is really an amazing number.

04:42.080 --> 04:45.200
 So that number 10 to the 31 is actually

04:45.200 --> 04:48.800
 just the bacterial viruses in the ocean.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.880
 So there are viruses that infect everything

04:50.880 --> 04:52.400
 on the planet, including bacteria.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.720
 There are a lot of bacteria in the ocean.

04:54.720 --> 04:58.280
 And so 10 to the 31 is from basically particle counts

04:58.280 --> 05:00.200
 of seawater all over the world.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.560
 So there are more viruses than 10 to the 31,

05:02.560 --> 05:04.240
 but just in the ocean.

05:04.240 --> 05:06.920
 And that number is so big.

05:06.920 --> 05:10.320
 First of all, the mass exceeds that of elephants

05:10.320 --> 05:12.040
 on the planet by a thousand fold.

05:12.040 --> 05:15.840
 And if you lined up those viruses end to end,

05:15.840 --> 05:19.720
 they would go 200 million light years into space.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.600
 It's so big a number.

05:21.600 --> 05:23.000
 It's amazing.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.560
 And then yes, 10 to the 20 some infections per second

05:27.560 --> 05:30.240
 of these viruses killing bacteria

05:30.240 --> 05:32.680
 and releasing all this organic matter.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.040
 And that's part of this, what we call

05:35.040 --> 05:39.680
 the biogeochemical pump, cycling of material in the ocean.

05:39.680 --> 05:42.600
 The bacteria die, they start to sink

05:42.600 --> 05:45.120
 and then they get metabolized

05:45.120 --> 05:48.200
 and converted to compounds that are needed.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.960
 A lot of it gets released as carbon dioxide and so forth.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.800
 So these are actually really important cycles

05:52.800 --> 05:54.480
 that are catalyzed by the virus.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.320
 Well, it's so wild that nature has developed

05:56.320 --> 05:59.680
 a mechanism for mass murder of bacteria.

05:59.680 --> 06:00.840
 That's one way to look at it,

06:00.840 --> 06:02.840
 but it's just what happened, right?

06:02.840 --> 06:03.680
 It's interesting.

06:03.680 --> 06:06.400
 I mean, I wonder what the evolutionary advantage

06:06.400 --> 06:10.800
 of like such fast cycling of life is.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.360
 Is it just an accident of evolution

06:13.360 --> 06:16.200
 that viruses are so numerous

06:16.200 --> 06:20.800
 or is it a feature and not a bug?

06:20.800 --> 06:25.320
 So the fast is, it's not all fast.

06:25.320 --> 06:26.640
 Not all viruses are fast.

06:26.640 --> 06:28.720
 Some are 20 minutes per cycle.

06:28.720 --> 06:33.720
 Some take weeks per cycle, but that's just per second.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.640
 There's so many viruses in the ocean

06:35.640 --> 06:36.920
 that that's what you get per second,

06:36.920 --> 06:39.280
 no matter how fast the cycle is.

06:39.280 --> 06:41.760
 But I look at it this way.

06:41.760 --> 06:46.000
 Viruses were probably the first organic entities

06:46.000 --> 06:48.200
 to evolve on the planet.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.840
 Long ago, billion years ago,

06:50.840 --> 06:52.080
 just as the earth cooled

06:52.080 --> 06:55.480
 and organic molecules began to form,

06:55.480 --> 07:00.480
 I think these self, we call them self replicators.

07:00.480 --> 07:02.720
 They're just short things that today,

07:02.720 --> 07:07.720
 would look like RNA, which is the basis of many viruses.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.960
 They evolved and they were able to replicate.

07:09.960 --> 07:12.400
 Of course, they were just naked molecules.

07:12.400 --> 07:16.320
 They had no protection and it was just RNA based.

07:16.320 --> 07:20.560
 And that's tough because RNA is pretty fragile in the world.

07:20.560 --> 07:24.760
 And it probably didn't get very big as a consequence.

07:24.760 --> 07:28.920
 But then proteins evolved and I'm skipping like hundreds

07:28.920 --> 07:30.400
 of millions of years of evolution.

07:30.400 --> 07:35.400
 Proteins evolved, maybe without a cell, maybe with a cell.

07:35.400 --> 07:38.240
 But then to make a cell,

07:38.240 --> 07:40.800
 there probably were some RNA based cells early on,

07:40.800 --> 07:42.240
 but they were pretty simple.

07:42.240 --> 07:43.840
 But the cells that we know of today,

07:43.840 --> 07:47.320
 even bacteria and single celled eukaryotes,

07:48.360 --> 07:50.720
 they have very long DNA genomes.

07:50.720 --> 07:54.360
 And you need a lot of DNA to make a complicated cell.

07:54.360 --> 07:59.360
 And so we think at some point, the RNA became DNA.

07:59.360 --> 08:04.080
 And probably one of the earliest enzymes that arose

08:04.080 --> 08:06.480
 is the enzyme that could copy that RNA into DNA,

08:06.480 --> 08:09.040
 which we now know today as reverse transcriptase,

08:09.040 --> 08:11.560
 which my former boss, David Baltimore

08:11.560 --> 08:14.160
 and Howard Temin co discovered.

08:14.160 --> 08:19.160
 And that enzyme arose and copied RNA to DNA.

08:19.400 --> 08:22.080
 And then you could build big cells with DNA

08:22.080 --> 08:24.600
 because DNA can be millions and millions of bases

08:24.600 --> 08:27.720
 in length and RNA, the longest RNA we know of

08:27.720 --> 08:32.720
 is 40,000 bases, not much bigger than the SARS CoV2.

08:32.880 --> 08:36.200
 What would you say is the magic moment along that line?

08:36.200 --> 08:39.920
 I saw it was one or two billion,

08:39.920 --> 08:43.840
 maybe three billion years it took

08:43.840 --> 08:48.840
 to go from bacteria to complex organism.

08:49.240 --> 08:52.800
 It seems like Earth had a very long time,

08:52.800 --> 08:54.800
 not a very long time without life,

08:54.800 --> 08:58.800
 and then a very long time with very primitive life.

08:59.920 --> 09:03.200
 Maybe I'm discriminating, calling bacteria primitive life.

09:03.200 --> 09:06.240
 People would object to you doing that for sure.

09:06.240 --> 09:07.800
 But it seems like complex organism

09:07.800 --> 09:11.040
 when it starts becoming something like,

09:11.040 --> 09:13.320
 I don't know what's a good, not animal like,

09:13.320 --> 09:16.880
 but more complexity than just like a single cell.

09:17.800 --> 09:20.040
 What do you think is the magic there?

09:20.040 --> 09:21.000
 What's the hardest thing?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.600
 If you were trying to engineer Earth and build life

09:23.600 --> 09:25.080
 and build the simulations,

09:25.080 --> 09:27.880
 obviously we're living in a video game, what this is.

09:27.880 --> 09:29.160
 So if you were trying to build this video game,

09:29.160 --> 09:32.080
 what's the hardest part along this evolution?

09:32.080 --> 09:36.080
 Bacteria are mostly single cells.

09:36.080 --> 09:37.520
 They do make colonies.

09:37.520 --> 09:41.160
 They get together in biofilms, which are really important.

09:41.160 --> 09:43.840
 But they're all single bacteria in that.

09:43.840 --> 09:46.760
 And the key is making an organism

09:46.760 --> 09:49.360
 where cells do different things.

09:49.360 --> 09:51.760
 We have skin cells and eye cells and brain cells.

09:51.760 --> 09:53.320
 Bacteria never do that.

09:53.320 --> 09:55.520
 And the reason is probably energy.

09:55.520 --> 09:58.920
 Bacteria can't make enough energy to do that.

09:58.920 --> 10:02.600
 And so there was another cell

10:02.600 --> 10:04.320
 existing at the time, the archaea.

10:06.120 --> 10:10.160
 And the idea is that a bacteria went into an archaea

10:10.160 --> 10:13.120
 and became the modern day mitochondria,

10:13.120 --> 10:14.960
 the energy factory of the cell.

10:14.960 --> 10:17.480
 And that now led that cell

10:17.480 --> 10:19.880
 develop into more and more complicated organisms

10:19.880 --> 10:20.720
 like we have today.

10:20.720 --> 10:21.800
 It was all about energy.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.520
 So the mitochondria, the energy,

10:24.520 --> 10:26.440
 the mitochondria is the magic thing.

10:26.440 --> 10:27.280
 I think so.

10:27.280 --> 10:28.720
 It's just actually not my idea.

10:28.720 --> 10:29.560
 It's Nick Jones.

10:29.560 --> 10:30.600
 Have you heard of Nick Jones?

10:30.600 --> 10:33.480
 He's an evolutionary biologist in the UK.

10:33.480 --> 10:36.400
 And he's done experimental work on this.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.440
 And it's his idea that the defining point

10:39.440 --> 10:41.840
 was the ability to make a lot of energy,

10:41.840 --> 10:43.080
 which a mitochondria can do.

10:43.080 --> 10:46.240
 It's basically a whole bacteria inside of a bigger cell.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.240
 And that becomes what we now call eukaryotes

10:48.240 --> 10:51.640
 and that they can get more and more complicated.

10:51.640 --> 10:53.200
 So let me bring you back to the viruses.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.320
 I wanna finish that story.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.280
 Yeah, which points of viruses come along?

10:56.280 --> 10:58.800
 So remember, we have these precellular,

10:58.800 --> 11:01.480
 they're called precellular replicons, right?

11:01.480 --> 11:05.240
 And so we have a precellular stage

11:05.240 --> 11:08.720
 where we have these self replicating molecules

11:08.720 --> 11:10.600
 and then cells arise.

11:10.600 --> 11:15.600
 And then the self replicating molecules invade the cells.

11:15.720 --> 11:16.560
 Why?

11:16.560 --> 11:17.960
 Because it's a hospitable environment.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.240
 I mean, they didn't know that.

11:19.240 --> 11:20.560
 They just went in and it turned out

11:20.560 --> 11:23.480
 it was beneficial for them, so it stuck.

11:23.480 --> 11:25.600
 And they replicate inside the cell now

11:25.600 --> 11:27.480
 where they have pools of everything they need.

11:27.480 --> 11:29.240
 They get more and more complicated.

11:29.240 --> 11:31.880
 And then they steal proteins from the cell

11:31.880 --> 11:34.240
 to build a protective shell.

11:34.240 --> 11:36.920
 And then they can be released as virus particles.

11:36.920 --> 11:37.840
 They're now protected.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.920
 They can move from host to host.

11:39.920 --> 11:43.560
 And because they're at the earliest stages

11:43.560 --> 11:46.680
 of cellular evolution, they can diversify

11:46.680 --> 11:48.400
 to infect anything that arises.

11:48.400 --> 11:52.320
 And that is why I think there's so many of them

11:52.320 --> 11:54.560
 and everything on the planet is infected

11:54.560 --> 11:56.080
 because the ancestor of everything

11:56.080 --> 11:57.480
 was infected many years ago.

11:57.480 --> 12:01.680
 So it's easier to steal than to build from scratch.

12:01.680 --> 12:05.280
 So it's easier to sort of break into somebody else's thing

12:05.280 --> 12:06.400
 and steal their proteins.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.520
 Yes.

12:07.520 --> 12:11.360
 My colleague, Dixon de Palmier, calls viruses safe crackers.

12:11.360 --> 12:12.680
 Safe crackers.

12:12.680 --> 12:15.800
 So it's just, from an evolutionary perspective,

12:15.800 --> 12:20.720
 it's easier to steal because you can select.

12:20.720 --> 12:23.320
 But then you have to figure out mechanisms for stealing,

12:23.320 --> 12:25.640
 for breaking into, for cracking the state.

12:25.640 --> 12:26.920
 Well, you don't have to figure out.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.560
 It just happens, right?

12:28.560 --> 12:30.920
 Because molecules are so diverse

12:30.920 --> 12:33.360
 that a molecule gets into a cell

12:33.360 --> 12:35.760
 and if there's a protein that sticks to it,

12:35.760 --> 12:39.400
 it's gonna stick and that gives an advantage.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.120
 There's no planning.

12:41.120 --> 12:43.040
 There's no thinking about it, right?

12:43.040 --> 12:44.960
 It just happens.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.240
 Oh, we'll return to that.

12:46.240 --> 12:48.280
 Ha ha ha ha ha.

12:48.280 --> 12:50.840
 What, but these numbers are crazy.

12:50.840 --> 12:55.840
 So what, as these more complex organisms evolved,

12:55.880 --> 12:58.000
 let's take us humans as an example,

12:58.960 --> 13:01.360
 should we be afraid of these high numbers?

13:01.360 --> 13:02.320
 Should we be worried

13:02.320 --> 13:05.240
 that there's so many viruses in the world?

13:05.240 --> 13:06.280
 Well, to a certain extent.

13:06.280 --> 13:08.200
 I mean, they have, it's twofold.

13:08.200 --> 13:09.280
 They're good and bad, right?

13:09.280 --> 13:12.000
 Viruses are no, there was no question they can be bad.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.040
 We know that because they've infected

13:14.040 --> 13:15.480
 and caused disease throughout history,

13:15.480 --> 13:17.880
 but we're also, you and I are full of viruses

13:17.880 --> 13:20.200
 that don't hurt us at all and probably help us

13:20.200 --> 13:22.000
 and every organism is the same.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.880
 So they are clearly beneficial as a consequence.

13:25.880 --> 13:30.880
 So I think, so every living thing on the planet

13:31.000 --> 13:35.760
 has multiple viruses infecting everything you can see.

13:35.760 --> 13:39.560
 And most of them I think we don't worry about

13:39.560 --> 13:41.320
 because they can't infect us.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.160
 They're unable.

13:42.160 --> 13:45.960
 In fact, now you can actually take your feces

13:45.960 --> 13:47.000
 and send them to a company

13:47.000 --> 13:49.960
 and they will sequence your viruses in your feces for you,

13:49.960 --> 13:52.200
 your fecal virome, right?

13:52.200 --> 13:57.200
 And the most common virus in human feces

13:57.680 --> 14:00.480
 is a plant virus that infects peppers.

14:00.480 --> 14:03.120
 It's called pepper model mosaic virus.

14:03.120 --> 14:05.040
 And that's because people eat a lot of peppers

14:05.040 --> 14:06.680
 and it just passes right through you.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.160
 Cabbage is full of viruses from the insects

14:09.160 --> 14:10.880
 that walk on the cabbage in the fields.

14:10.880 --> 14:13.120
 We eat them, they just pass us.

14:13.120 --> 14:16.360
 So I think most of the viruses we don't need to worry about

14:16.360 --> 14:19.480
 except when we're talking about species

14:19.480 --> 14:23.160
 that are closest to us, mammals, of course.

14:23.160 --> 14:25.320
 And I think the most numerous ones

14:25.320 --> 14:28.320
 are the most concerning, they're viruses like bats.

14:28.320 --> 14:33.320
 Bats are 20% of mammals and rodents are 40% of mammals.

14:33.480 --> 14:37.080
 And we humans live nearby, right?

14:37.080 --> 14:38.600
 And we know throughout history,

14:38.600 --> 14:41.440
 many viruses have come from bats and from rodents to people,

14:41.440 --> 14:42.280
 no question about it.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.600
 So there's a proximity in terms of just living together

14:44.600 --> 14:46.240
 and a proximity genetically too.

14:46.240 --> 14:48.800
 So it's more likely that a virus will jump

14:48.800 --> 14:49.880
 from a bat and a rodent.

14:49.880 --> 14:50.880
 And birds too.

14:50.880 --> 14:53.880
 Birds can give us their viruses that's happened.

14:53.880 --> 14:57.080
 Influenza viruses come from birds mainly.

14:57.080 --> 15:00.640
 So I think those are the three species,

15:00.640 --> 15:02.680
 not species, it's higher than species obviously,

15:02.680 --> 15:04.240
 but those are the three I would worry about

15:04.240 --> 15:05.960
 in terms of getting their viruses.

15:05.960 --> 15:09.520
 And we don't really know what's out there, right?

15:09.520 --> 15:12.480
 We have very little clue about what viruses,

15:12.480 --> 15:16.480
 and I've for years wanted to capture wild mice

15:16.480 --> 15:18.640
 in my backyard and see what viruses they have

15:18.640 --> 15:19.640
 because no one knows.

15:20.960 --> 15:21.800
 And it's an easy.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.760
 We can't ask them, so you mean map,

15:23.760 --> 15:24.600
 like is there a way?

15:24.600 --> 15:25.440
 I can't ask them, yeah.

15:25.440 --> 15:27.640
 No, I would have to sacrifice them and take tissue

15:27.640 --> 15:30.120
 and then bring it in the lab and do genome sequencing.

15:30.120 --> 15:32.160
 So you can do a thorough sequencing

15:32.160 --> 15:33.800
 to determine which viruses.

15:33.800 --> 15:37.400
 Is there a sufficiently good categorization of viruses

15:37.400 --> 15:38.240
 where you'd be?

15:38.240 --> 15:40.080
 That's a very good question.

15:40.080 --> 15:42.640
 So whenever you do sequence, right?

15:42.640 --> 15:44.160
 You get some environmental sample

15:44.160 --> 15:47.120
 and you extract nucleic acid and you sequence it.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.680
 What you do is you run it past the database.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.120
 The gold standard is the GenBank database

15:52.120 --> 15:54.360
 which is maintained here in the US.

15:54.360 --> 15:56.600
 And you see if you get any hits.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.560
 And then you can say, ah, look,

15:58.560 --> 16:01.080
 this sequence is similar to this virus.

16:01.080 --> 16:03.560
 And you can classify all the viruses you see.

16:03.560 --> 16:08.560
 The problem is 90% of your sequence is dark matter.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.120
 It doesn't hit with anything.

16:11.120 --> 16:14.480
 It's probably a lot of it is unknown viruses.

16:14.480 --> 16:16.080
 And that's gonna be hard to figure out

16:16.080 --> 16:17.640
 because someone's gonna have to go after it

16:17.640 --> 16:18.960
 and sort it through.

16:18.960 --> 16:21.600
 So yes, you can find a lot of viruses

16:21.600 --> 16:22.960
 and the numbers you get are astounding.

16:22.960 --> 16:25.200
 You can find thousands of new viruses

16:25.200 --> 16:28.160
 just by looking in various life forms.

16:28.160 --> 16:30.400
 But there are many more that we don't pick up

16:30.400 --> 16:32.200
 because they're not in the database.

16:32.200 --> 16:36.120
 Maybe this is a good time to take a quick tangent.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.000
 What do you think about Alpha Fold 2?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.280
 I don't know if you've been paying attention to that.

16:40.280 --> 16:44.200
 With them DeepMind solving the protein folding problem

16:44.200 --> 16:47.800
 and then also releasing, first of all,

16:47.800 --> 16:49.960
 open sourcing the code, which is for me

16:49.960 --> 16:52.240
 as a software person, I love.

16:52.240 --> 16:57.000
 And then second of all, also making like 300,000 predictions

16:57.000 --> 17:00.040
 or something like that for different protein structures

17:00.040 --> 17:01.760
 and releasing that data.

17:01.760 --> 17:02.600
 Yeah.

17:03.520 --> 17:04.360
 On the side of,

17:04.360 --> 17:06.840
 because you're saying there's dark matter.

17:06.840 --> 17:07.680
 Right.

17:07.680 --> 17:12.680
 Is there something, first, what are your general thoughts,

17:12.920 --> 17:15.920
 level of excitement about their work?

17:15.920 --> 17:19.400
 And second, how can that be applied to viruses?

17:19.400 --> 17:20.800
 Do you think we'll be able to explore

17:20.800 --> 17:24.520
 the dark matter of virology using machine learning?

17:24.520 --> 17:25.360
 Absolutely.

17:25.360 --> 17:26.800
 Because in all this dark sequence,

17:26.800 --> 17:29.880
 you can translate it and make a protein.

17:29.880 --> 17:31.480
 You can see what a protein looks like.

17:31.480 --> 17:34.000
 It has what we call an open reading frame, right?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.280
 A start and a stop.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.520
 And right now it's just a bunch of amino acids,

17:37.520 --> 17:39.800
 but if we could fold it,

17:39.800 --> 17:43.200
 maybe the fold would be like something we already know,

17:43.200 --> 17:46.480
 some protein fold, which gives you a lot of clues, right?

17:46.480 --> 17:49.640
 Because there are only so many protein folds in biology

17:49.640 --> 17:52.600
 and that dark matter is probably one of them.

17:52.600 --> 17:55.200
 So I think that's very exciting because for years,

17:55.200 --> 17:59.560
 I've followed structural biologists for years

17:59.560 --> 18:01.960
 and in the beginning,

18:01.960 --> 18:04.480
 we couldn't even solve structures of viruses, they're too big.

18:04.480 --> 18:06.760
 We could do small molecules like myoglobin,

18:06.760 --> 18:09.400
 that was the first one done, took years to do that.

18:09.400 --> 18:13.040
 Then as computational power increased,

18:13.040 --> 18:14.720
 then they could start to do viruses,

18:14.720 --> 18:16.760
 but it took a long time.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.400
 X ray crystallography,

18:18.400 --> 18:21.520
 depending on getting crystals of the virus, right?

18:21.520 --> 18:24.440
 And now we can do cryo electron microscopy,

18:24.440 --> 18:26.360
 which is much faster.

18:26.360 --> 18:27.240
 You could solve,

18:27.240 --> 18:29.680
 the spike of SARS COVID 2 was solved in two months

18:29.680 --> 18:32.520
 by Jason McClelland here in Austin actually

18:32.520 --> 18:34.840
 at the beginning of the pandemic,

18:34.840 --> 18:38.720
 but you're limited, you can't do huge proteins.

18:38.720 --> 18:41.960
 You can only do moderately sized ones.

18:41.960 --> 18:45.440
 So, or actually you can do viruses,

18:45.440 --> 18:47.000
 but you can't do small proteins.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.720
 So that's speeded it up, but it's still too fast to solve.

18:50.720 --> 18:52.720
 You get a new protein, you wanna solve its structure.

18:52.720 --> 18:53.840
 So if we could predict it,

18:53.840 --> 18:55.960
 and I know from talking to structural biologists,

18:55.960 --> 18:58.280
 this has been their holy grail from day one.

18:58.280 --> 19:00.880
 They wanna be able to take a sequence of a protein,

19:00.880 --> 19:03.320
 put it in a computer and have the structure put out

19:03.320 --> 19:05.200
 without having to do all the experiment.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.840
 So that's why this is very exciting

19:06.840 --> 19:08.560
 that you can predict it.

19:08.560 --> 19:10.800
 That mean it's not finished obviously,

19:10.800 --> 19:11.840
 and there's more to do,

19:11.840 --> 19:12.960
 but I think it will be a day

19:12.960 --> 19:15.540
 where you could take any amino acid sequence

19:15.540 --> 19:17.360
 and predict what it's gonna look like.

19:17.360 --> 19:19.520
 See, but like aren't structural biologists

19:19.520 --> 19:20.400
 gonna get greedy?

19:20.400 --> 19:21.720
 So once you have that,

19:21.720 --> 19:24.040
 don't you wanna go more complicated then?

19:24.040 --> 19:25.440
 Don't you wanna go,

19:25.440 --> 19:27.680
 because that's just the first step, right?

19:27.680 --> 19:29.480
 You go from amino acid to the structure,

19:29.480 --> 19:32.120
 then there's like multiple protein interactions.

19:32.120 --> 19:34.400
 Like how do you get to the virus?

19:34.400 --> 19:37.020
 Well, so that's what the ultimate goal

19:37.020 --> 19:39.700
 of getting a structure is that then you can do experiments

19:39.700 --> 19:42.400
 and figure out what the structure means, right?

19:42.400 --> 19:44.880
 So many, in the old days,

19:44.880 --> 19:48.160
 structural biology was a career in itself.

19:48.160 --> 19:50.000
 You worked with people who had a system

19:50.000 --> 19:51.360
 and just solve proteins for them,

19:51.360 --> 19:52.520
 and then you moved on to another one.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.200
 You didn't really do any experiments.

19:54.200 --> 19:57.000
 The other people got to do all the interesting experiments.

19:57.000 --> 20:02.000
 Now, young structural biologists are multifaceted.

20:02.300 --> 20:03.640
 They solve the structure,

20:03.640 --> 20:04.480
 and then they say,

20:04.480 --> 20:06.520
 what happens if we change this amino acid?

20:06.520 --> 20:09.000
 Oh, look, it blocks binding to the receptor.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.240
 This must be the receptor binding interface.

20:11.240 --> 20:13.400
 So that's the exciting stuff, absolutely,

20:13.400 --> 20:14.480
 is doing the experiment.

20:14.480 --> 20:18.780
 Well, I wonder if you can do some kinds of like simulations

20:18.780 --> 20:22.240
 of like, you know, different proteins

20:22.240 --> 20:26.320
 or multi protein systems going to war against each other,

20:27.640 --> 20:30.440
 like to try to figure out, you know,

20:31.400 --> 20:35.360
 reinforcement learning is used in alpha zero, for example,

20:35.360 --> 20:37.120
 to learn chess and go,

20:37.120 --> 20:39.200
 and that's using the self play mechanism

20:39.200 --> 20:41.360
 where the thing plays against itself

20:41.360 --> 20:42.760
 and learns better and better.

20:42.760 --> 20:45.080
 Whether you can, I wonder if you can simulate

20:45.080 --> 20:46.680
 almost evolution in that way

20:46.680 --> 20:49.560
 for primitive biological systems,

20:49.560 --> 20:52.600
 have them in simulation, fight each other,

20:52.600 --> 20:53.640
 and then see what comes out,

20:53.640 --> 20:55.680
 like a super dangerous virus comes out

20:55.680 --> 20:58.480
 or super like Chuck Norris type of thing

20:58.480 --> 21:00.640
 that defends against the super dangerous virus,

21:00.640 --> 21:01.840
 and it's all in simulation.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.680
 So an example would be,

21:03.680 --> 21:07.840
 we have all these variants of SARS COVID 2 arising, right?

21:07.840 --> 21:12.840
 Which look to be selected by immune responses,

21:13.080 --> 21:17.280
 but we know what amino acids are changing in the spike

21:17.280 --> 21:19.080
 and how they block antibody binding.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.360
 You could simulate that.

21:20.360 --> 21:24.960
 You could say, what is the antibody looking at?

21:24.960 --> 21:28.040
 Where antibodies bind on proteins are called epitopes, right?

21:28.040 --> 21:30.400
 You could map them all and change them in a simulation

21:30.400 --> 21:32.120
 one by one and go back and forth

21:32.120 --> 21:33.800
 between the antibody and the virus.

21:33.800 --> 21:38.400
 So all these, evolution is what we call an arms race, right?

21:38.400 --> 21:41.600
 The virus changes and then it evades the host

21:41.600 --> 21:43.240
 and then the host can change.

21:43.240 --> 21:45.240
 The host takes longer to change though, unfortunately.

21:45.240 --> 21:47.960
 It takes geological time, but it can.

21:47.960 --> 21:49.640
 And then the virus can change

21:49.640 --> 21:50.600
 and it can go back and forth.

21:50.600 --> 21:54.360
 And we can see evidence of this in genome sequences

21:54.360 --> 21:56.240
 of both viruses and their hosts.

21:56.240 --> 22:00.040
 And so you can take a protein in a host

22:00.040 --> 22:02.720
 that is a receptor for multiple viruses

22:02.720 --> 22:05.720
 and you can see all the impacts of virus pressure on it.

22:05.720 --> 22:07.280
 And you could simulate that for sure.

22:07.280 --> 22:09.000
 And that's just one thing that you could do.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.680
 You could simulate changes in say an enzyme

22:13.680 --> 22:15.120
 that makes it resistant to a drug

22:15.120 --> 22:18.240
 and predict all the drug resistance.

22:18.240 --> 22:21.280
 But the problem is people like me,

22:21.280 --> 22:22.800
 the experimental virologists

22:22.800 --> 22:24.040
 don't know how to do any of that.

22:24.040 --> 22:27.720
 So we need to collaborate with people, I guess.

22:27.720 --> 22:29.680
 Oh, with other humans.

22:29.680 --> 22:31.480
 We do that, we do that.

22:31.480 --> 22:35.720
 But with people from a field that we're not used to,

22:35.720 --> 22:39.160
 I suppose people who, would it be AI, I suppose?

22:39.160 --> 22:40.000
 Yeah, machine learning people.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.320
 Machine learning people.

22:41.320 --> 22:44.400
 And you would say, look, this is the biological problem.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.960
 Is there a way we can use your tools to attack it?

22:46.960 --> 22:51.680
 The problem is those people are antisocial introverts

22:51.680 --> 22:55.160
 that have a place like this

22:55.160 --> 22:57.200
 and try to hide from other people in the world.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.160
 Very difficult to find in the wild.

23:00.120 --> 23:04.960
 Okay, so outside of doing amazing brilliant lectures online,

23:04.960 --> 23:09.960
 you host and produce five, I would say, related podcasts,

23:09.960 --> 23:13.600
 including my favorite, This Week in Virology,

23:13.600 --> 23:16.280
 also This Week in Parasitism,

23:16.280 --> 23:18.640
 This Week in Microbiology, and so on.

23:18.640 --> 23:21.080
 So you're a good person to ask,

23:21.080 --> 23:23.960
 what are the categories of small things,

23:23.960 --> 23:27.320
 small biological things in this world that can kill you,

23:27.320 --> 23:28.880
 kill us humans?

23:30.120 --> 23:33.360
 Let's look, you said like most viruses are friendly

23:33.360 --> 23:35.840
 or at least not unfriendly.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.960
 But let's look at the unfriendly ones.

23:38.960 --> 23:42.160
 And viruses and bacteria and those kinds of things.

23:42.160 --> 23:43.960
 When you look at the full spectrum of things

23:43.960 --> 23:47.240
 that can kill you, can you kind of paint a brief picture?

23:47.240 --> 23:50.720
 Yeah, I think the big picture is that

23:50.720 --> 23:52.720
 the things that can kill you are a minority

23:52.720 --> 23:54.320
 of everything that's out there.

23:54.320 --> 23:57.240
 And we're talking about molecules.

23:57.240 --> 24:01.320
 So we have in us proteins that can kill us.

24:01.320 --> 24:04.560
 Preons that are just, it's a protein in us.

24:04.560 --> 24:08.680
 And if it misfolds, it makes all of its other copies misfold

24:08.680 --> 24:11.680
 and then you die of a neurological disease.

24:11.680 --> 24:12.680
 That's pretty rare.

24:13.840 --> 24:16.480
 So there are proteins, there are viruses.

24:16.480 --> 24:20.200
 And as I said, only certain ones can kill us.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.960
 But even if we get those from animals,

24:22.960 --> 24:24.440
 it's not straightforward.

24:24.440 --> 24:26.760
 If you look at SARS CoV2, right?

24:26.760 --> 24:29.880
 This is probably a once in a hundred year pandemic,

24:29.880 --> 24:34.760
 I would say, equivalent to 1918 in its devastation.

24:34.760 --> 24:36.560
 And in between there have been smaller pandemics

24:36.560 --> 24:39.600
 of other viruses, but it doesn't happen all that often.

24:39.600 --> 24:40.560
 So we have a lot of viruses.

24:40.560 --> 24:43.600
 We have a lot of bacteria of various sorts

24:43.600 --> 24:46.240
 that can cause infections in us.

24:46.240 --> 24:49.240
 And it's a limited number, right?

24:49.240 --> 24:52.680
 You're streptococci and staphylococci and clostridia.

24:52.680 --> 24:56.360
 We could go on and on, but we know how to handle those.

24:56.360 --> 24:58.280
 As long as we have antimicrobials,

24:58.280 --> 25:00.360
 it's just that we abuse them and we get resistant.

25:00.360 --> 25:02.120
 So that can be a problem.

25:02.120 --> 25:04.840
 Then we have fungi, not mushrooms,

25:04.840 --> 25:09.440
 but much smaller fungi that multiply sub microscopic

25:09.440 --> 25:11.400
 or just at the microscopic level.

25:11.400 --> 25:13.920
 They can, in dry climates of the US,

25:13.920 --> 25:16.280
 you can inhale their spores and they can grow in your lung

25:16.280 --> 25:18.800
 if you're immunosuppressed and so forth.

25:18.800 --> 25:21.080
 So those are the tiny guys.

25:21.080 --> 25:22.320
 And then we have parasites,

25:22.320 --> 25:24.960
 which we do this week in parasitism,

25:24.960 --> 25:29.960
 where single cells, even worms of various sorts

25:30.040 --> 25:33.640
 can invade you and cause all sorts of problems.

25:33.640 --> 25:37.200
 How, I was like kind of terrified to listen to that podcast.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.720
 What's it like?

25:39.720 --> 25:44.720
 Well, I mean, what you learn is that you can,

25:45.200 --> 25:47.200
 you travel somewhere and you can get infected

25:47.200 --> 25:48.720
 and bring it back home.

25:48.720 --> 25:52.640
 Here in the US, we do have certain kinds of parasites,

25:52.640 --> 25:55.000
 but because of our lifestyle,

25:55.000 --> 25:56.560
 we more or less have avoided them.

25:56.560 --> 26:00.440
 For example, there's a parasite called toxoplasma,

26:00.440 --> 26:03.960
 which is infected most of the world, actually,

26:03.960 --> 26:06.160
 because a lot of people like to eat raw meat

26:06.160 --> 26:08.400
 and you would get it from raw meat.

26:08.400 --> 26:12.320
 And we're not as fond of that here in the US.

26:12.320 --> 26:13.320
 We like to cook our meat,

26:13.320 --> 26:16.440
 but that could be a consequence of eating raw meat.

26:16.440 --> 26:19.840
 Is that what leads to, what is it called, toxoplasmosis?

26:19.840 --> 26:24.360
 Yeah, so toxoplasmosis, it's mainly,

26:25.560 --> 26:28.400
 a big issue is if you're pregnant and you get toxo,

26:28.400 --> 26:32.520
 then your fetus is gonna be very badly malformed.

26:32.520 --> 26:35.000
 It's gonna have brain defects and so forth.

26:36.240 --> 26:39.480
 And animals can get it as well.

26:39.480 --> 26:41.280
 So there are a lot of parasites of that nature,

26:41.280 --> 26:43.280
 which you often acquire by food,

26:43.280 --> 26:45.000
 eating food of different sorts.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.560
 And it usually happens elsewhere.

26:47.560 --> 26:50.840
 On This Week in Parasitism, we do a case.

26:50.840 --> 26:54.320
 So Daniel Griffin is our resident physician.

26:54.320 --> 26:56.480
 He's a doctor, a real doctor, right?

26:56.480 --> 26:58.640
 And every month, he comes up with a case.

26:58.640 --> 27:00.880
 Okay, this is a person I saw.

27:00.880 --> 27:04.960
 And last month, this young lady had traveled somewhere

27:04.960 --> 27:09.600
 and she ate raw fish.

27:09.600 --> 27:11.920
 It was somewhere Southeast Asia or something.

27:11.920 --> 27:15.880
 And she ended up with red bumps all over her skin.

27:15.880 --> 27:17.720
 And it turned out it was a parasite from the fish

27:17.720 --> 27:21.720
 that moved around in her and very easy to cure.

27:21.720 --> 27:23.720
 We have, if the right doctors and the right drugs,

27:23.720 --> 27:24.640
 you can cure all these things.

27:24.640 --> 27:27.600
 What about diagnose, like connect the red spots

27:27.600 --> 27:28.760
 to the fact that it's a parasite?

27:28.760 --> 27:31.240
 It's very easy if you have the right diagnostics.

27:31.240 --> 27:33.080
 Now, Daniel often goes to parts of the world

27:33.080 --> 27:34.560
 where they don't have diagnostics

27:34.560 --> 27:37.240
 and he has to use other mechanisms.

27:37.240 --> 27:40.320
 He may have to take a bit and look at it under a microscope.

27:40.320 --> 27:41.960
 And then he may not be able to get the drug

27:41.960 --> 27:43.840
 depending on where he is.

27:43.840 --> 27:47.160
 But often he sees patients who come back to the US

27:47.160 --> 27:49.640
 and they get diarrhea or they have a fever.

27:49.640 --> 27:50.720
 And he said, where have you been?

27:50.720 --> 27:52.200
 And he can put two and two together.

27:52.200 --> 27:53.800
 And so we let our listeners do that.

27:53.800 --> 27:55.240
 And they all send in guesses.

27:55.240 --> 27:57.840
 And it's wonderful to hear them go through this.

27:57.840 --> 28:00.760
 So there are a lot of parasites that can get you.

28:00.760 --> 28:03.360
 You have to be careful about eating when you go overseas.

28:03.360 --> 28:04.640
 And water too?

28:04.640 --> 28:05.520
 Water as well.

28:05.520 --> 28:09.200
 And in parts of Africa, there are parasites in the lakes

28:09.200 --> 28:11.840
 that if you go swimming, they can invade you.

28:11.840 --> 28:14.080
 And in fact, they can go into your hair follicles

28:14.080 --> 28:15.960
 and burrow in and get into your bloodstream.

28:15.960 --> 28:16.960
 That's exciting.

28:16.960 --> 28:20.320
 So Daniel is interesting because he's very adventurous

28:20.320 --> 28:22.800
 and he's not afraid of any of this.

28:22.800 --> 28:26.040
 So there's a famous lake in Africa, Lake Malawi,

28:26.040 --> 28:28.480
 which harbors a lot of these parasites.

28:28.480 --> 28:30.280
 And he said, oh yeah, yeah, I just make sure

28:30.280 --> 28:34.840
 I towel off vigorously when I get out and get rid of them.

28:34.840 --> 28:37.160
 And that was the name of an episode.

28:37.160 --> 28:42.160
 But food is, sushi, you can get worms from sushi.

28:43.400 --> 28:46.800
 And the solution is to freeze it.

28:46.800 --> 28:49.880
 And many sushi restaurants now have liquid nitrogen.

28:49.880 --> 28:53.000
 They snap freeze their sushi and that kills all the parasites.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.400
 And a study was actually done in Japan

28:56.400 --> 28:59.240
 showing that freezing does not alter the taste of sushi

28:59.240 --> 29:01.680
 because it's up, you see a big industry there.

29:01.680 --> 29:03.240
 Wow, that's brilliant.

29:03.240 --> 29:04.440
 That's brilliant.

29:04.440 --> 29:09.440
 Yeah, I was thinking about, I'm so boring and bland

29:10.560 --> 29:12.640
 that especially when I am now in Texas here

29:12.640 --> 29:14.280
 and I've been eating quite a bit of barbecue,

29:14.280 --> 29:18.960
 I realized I really haven't explored the culinary world.

29:18.960 --> 29:22.280
 And I've been curious to travel and taste different foods.

29:22.280 --> 29:25.060
 Is there something you could say by way of advice,

29:26.680 --> 29:30.160
 channeling Daniel, I guess, if you were to travel

29:30.160 --> 29:32.600
 in the world, if eating is the thing

29:32.600 --> 29:34.560
 that gets you the parasites,

29:34.560 --> 29:37.040
 what's a good advice for eating

29:37.040 --> 29:41.760
 in strange parts of the world, Mongolia, India, China?

29:41.760 --> 29:43.840
 Is there something you could say by way of advice?

29:43.840 --> 29:45.200
 I think Daniel would say,

29:45.200 --> 29:47.520
 make sure your food is cooked, right?

29:47.520 --> 29:49.040
 Cooked, but that's so boring.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.440
 Yeah, it's unfortunate.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.200
 And he would agree with you

29:52.200 --> 29:55.520
 because many vegetables are delicious.

29:55.520 --> 29:57.840
 Salads even are delicious, not cooked,

29:57.840 --> 29:59.520
 but they can have parasites in them.

29:59.520 --> 30:04.280
 Meats, fish, people like to have uncooked fish.

30:04.280 --> 30:06.060
 So if you wanna be really safe and boring,

30:06.060 --> 30:07.920
 just make sure everything is cooked.

30:07.920 --> 30:11.000
 And now we have a case this week on TWIP

30:11.000 --> 30:14.200
 of a young man who went, I forgot where he went,

30:14.200 --> 30:15.600
 but he stayed in a hotel.

30:15.600 --> 30:18.080
 I think, oh, Oaxaca, Mexico.

30:18.080 --> 30:19.320
 Stayed in a hotel.

30:20.480 --> 30:23.740
 And he came back with diarrhea and fever.

30:23.740 --> 30:26.520
 And he said, I don't know where, I stayed in the hotel.

30:26.520 --> 30:30.000
 I just ate hotel food, lots of vegetables and fruits,

30:30.000 --> 30:32.960
 and probably they weren't washed with clean water.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.840
 He got something from that.

30:34.840 --> 30:38.480
 The bottom line is most of these infections

30:38.480 --> 30:40.180
 with parasites can be diagnosed,

30:40.180 --> 30:42.680
 and you can be treated, and you'll be fine.

30:42.680 --> 30:47.520
 So if you really wanna experience the cuisine,

30:47.520 --> 30:49.240
 I don't think you should worry about it.

30:49.240 --> 30:50.680
 That's what Daniel would say.

30:50.680 --> 30:51.960
 Let's return to the basics.

30:51.960 --> 30:54.840
 We can then jump around all over the place.

30:54.840 --> 30:58.720
 What are the basic principles of virology?

30:58.720 --> 31:02.120
 Maybe a good place to start is what is a virus?

31:02.120 --> 31:03.600
 That's great.

31:03.600 --> 31:05.840
 I mean, I talk in my first lecture for 20 minutes

31:05.840 --> 31:07.520
 before I get to that.

31:07.520 --> 31:10.060
 But, and I wonder if I should put it up front,

31:10.060 --> 31:12.100
 but it's kind of a boring definition.

31:12.100 --> 31:14.840
 So if you do that first, people will turn off.

31:14.840 --> 31:17.600
 So first you tell them about all the millions and billions

31:17.600 --> 31:18.920
 of viruses around.

31:18.920 --> 31:22.720
 So a virus, we have a very specific definition

31:22.720 --> 31:26.400
 because it's different from everything else on the planet.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.960
 Because first of all, it's a parasite.

31:28.960 --> 31:32.060
 It takes, a parasite means you take something

31:32.060 --> 31:33.920
 from someone else.

31:33.920 --> 31:36.840
 We have human parasites who take money from others, right?

31:36.840 --> 31:40.880
 But in biological terms, a parasite takes something

31:40.880 --> 31:44.280
 from the host that the host would otherwise use energy

31:44.280 --> 31:46.200
 or some building block or something.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.560
 There's never really a symbiotic relationship

31:48.560 --> 31:50.440
 between a virus and a host.

31:50.440 --> 31:52.000
 Well, there can be.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.640
 So that's the dichotomy I think is that we define them

31:54.640 --> 31:58.720
 as parasites, yet I just told you 20 minutes ago

31:58.720 --> 32:01.520
 that many viruses are probably beneficial.

32:01.520 --> 32:04.480
 So I think what it means is we, at some point

32:04.480 --> 32:06.800
 we're gonna have to change our definition, right?

32:06.800 --> 32:11.800
 Because after all, definitions we make are just constructs

32:12.000 --> 32:14.140
 that make it easy for us to study,

32:14.140 --> 32:16.760
 that don't necessarily represent what's right.

32:16.760 --> 32:20.420
 Yeah, like Pluto was a planet at first

32:20.420 --> 32:21.680
 and now it's not a planet anymore

32:21.680 --> 32:23.360
 and a lot of people are very upset.

32:23.360 --> 32:24.700
 But it's only according to us.

32:24.700 --> 32:27.020
 There may be another race living somewhere else

32:27.020 --> 32:28.500
 who thinks it's a planet, right?

32:28.500 --> 32:30.680
 Well, maybe that's why viruses are attacking humans.

32:30.680 --> 32:31.560
 They're very angry.

32:31.560 --> 32:33.980
 They're calling them parasites.

32:33.980 --> 32:38.000
 So right now our definition includes parasite

32:38.000 --> 32:41.400
 because a virus cannot do anything without a cell.

32:41.400 --> 32:44.040
 If this mug were full of viruses,

32:44.040 --> 32:46.360
 it would not do anything for years.

32:46.360 --> 32:49.040
 It would eventually probably lose its infectivity,

32:49.040 --> 32:52.040
 but it's not gonna reproduce here, it needs cells.

32:52.040 --> 32:54.240
 And to the first people who discovered viruses,

32:54.240 --> 32:57.360
 that was astounding that they didn't just reproduce,

32:57.360 --> 32:59.640
 divide on their own like bacteria.

32:59.640 --> 33:02.640
 So a virus needs to get inside of a cell,

33:02.640 --> 33:05.520
 inside the cell, it can't just hang around on the surface.

33:05.520 --> 33:09.200
 It needs to get in in order to make more of itself.

33:09.200 --> 33:13.080
 And so we call it an obligate intracellular parasite

33:13.080 --> 33:15.060
 because it needs to get in a cell

33:15.060 --> 33:17.320
 and then it takes things from the cell

33:17.320 --> 33:19.280
 in the form of all kinds of molecules

33:19.280 --> 33:22.660
 and processes and energy and so forth to make new viruses.

33:23.640 --> 33:26.240
 Obligate means it's obligated to be inside the cell.

33:26.240 --> 33:30.800
 Absolutely, it will not reproduce outside of the cell.

33:30.800 --> 33:35.800
 So this mug of viruses can in no way be living,

33:35.880 --> 33:36.920
 in my opinion.

33:36.920 --> 33:39.160
 However, once it gets inside of a cell,

33:39.160 --> 33:42.320
 now the cell is a virus infected cell, it's alive.

33:42.320 --> 33:45.360
 So a virus, in my view, has two phases, right?

33:45.360 --> 33:48.200
 It's this nonliving particulate phase

33:48.200 --> 33:49.580
 that everyone is used to.

33:50.600 --> 33:52.720
 I'll send you, you need a virus for your table.

33:52.720 --> 33:54.560
 I'll send you a nice model.

33:54.560 --> 33:55.400
 I think it would look good here.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.240
 Which, yes, definitely.

33:56.240 --> 33:57.800
 You don't have to go with all this other stuff.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.560
 Yeah, well, these are all mechanical.

33:59.560 --> 34:01.240
 There's no biology here.

34:01.240 --> 34:02.480
 So you wouldn't want a virus here?

34:02.480 --> 34:04.000
 No, I'd want a virus, of course.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.840
 No, I'll send you one and then you can look at it.

34:06.840 --> 34:09.920
 Because now that we have the three dimensional structures

34:09.920 --> 34:12.600
 solved by structural biologists,

34:12.600 --> 34:14.720
 we take the coordinates and we put it in a 3D printer

34:14.720 --> 34:16.880
 and you can make amazing models, right?

34:18.040 --> 34:18.880
 Of any virus.

34:18.880 --> 34:21.520
 And so there's a huge variety of viruses?

34:21.520 --> 34:23.320
 Huge, that we know of,

34:23.320 --> 34:24.840
 which is only a fraction of what's out there.

34:24.840 --> 34:25.800
 What's the categories?

34:25.800 --> 34:27.840
 So there's RNA, there's DNA viruses.

34:27.840 --> 34:30.240
 What are those, what's DNA and RNA?

34:30.240 --> 34:33.920
 Two broad categorizations.

34:33.920 --> 34:37.080
 RNA, these are genetic material.

34:37.080 --> 34:39.200
 Can be two different chemicals.

34:39.200 --> 34:43.120
 So RNA, everything else on the planet besides viruses

34:43.120 --> 34:44.120
 is all DNA based.

34:44.120 --> 34:45.280
 You and I are DNA based.

34:45.280 --> 34:47.320
 Everything on the planet today is DNA based,

34:47.320 --> 34:50.200
 except some viruses are RNA based.

34:50.200 --> 34:53.120
 And that's because, as I mentioned earlier,

34:53.120 --> 34:57.240
 the first life that arose on the planet was RNA based.

34:57.240 --> 34:59.480
 Yeah, so these are like old school viruses.

34:59.480 --> 35:00.600
 These are old school.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.560
 We call relics, yeah.

35:02.560 --> 35:04.480
 Relics, and this has got a name,

35:04.480 --> 35:06.760
 it's called the RNA world, which I think is great.

35:06.760 --> 35:09.640
 Is it big still, or are the relics dying out?

35:09.640 --> 35:11.520
 Oh no, the relics, in my opinion,

35:11.520 --> 35:14.880
 are the most successful viruses, the RNA viruses.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.680
 And SARS CoV2 is an RNA virus.

35:16.680 --> 35:19.040
 We can talk about why they're so successful.

35:19.040 --> 35:22.720
 But you have, broadly speaking, viruses with RNA,

35:22.720 --> 35:24.920
 genetic information, which are relics.

35:24.920 --> 35:26.440
 Of course, they're contemporary.

35:26.440 --> 35:28.920
 They have adapted to the modern world

35:28.920 --> 35:31.160
 and the modern organisms living in it.

35:31.160 --> 35:33.240
 And then we have DNA based viruses,

35:33.240 --> 35:36.440
 which are extremely conservative and slow.

35:36.440 --> 35:37.800
 They're very successful.

35:37.800 --> 35:40.040
 Everyone has a herpes virus infection,

35:40.040 --> 35:44.520
 but they don't get the news like the RNA viruses do.

35:44.520 --> 35:46.800
 The HIVs and the influenza viruses

35:46.800 --> 35:49.880
 and the SARS Coronaviruses, they get all the press

35:49.880 --> 35:52.880
 and they're RNA based, because RNA lets you change

35:52.880 --> 35:54.400
 more so than DNA.

35:54.400 --> 35:57.240
 So they evolve much faster, the RNA viruses.

35:57.240 --> 35:58.320
 Much faster.

35:58.320 --> 36:01.920
 And in fact, I have an lecture on evolution.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.800
 I don't know if you've listened to that one.

36:03.800 --> 36:06.600
 You should, it's really, I think it's really interesting.

36:07.760 --> 36:12.760
 RNA viruses exist at their error threshold,

36:13.720 --> 36:17.120
 which means they can't make any more mutations

36:17.120 --> 36:19.560
 when they reproduce, otherwise they're dead.

36:19.560 --> 36:20.880
 They would go extinct.

36:20.880 --> 36:23.600
 They're evolving at their error threshold.

36:23.600 --> 36:26.280
 DNA viruses are hundreds of times lower

36:26.280 --> 36:28.400
 than their error thresholds.

36:28.400 --> 36:31.120
 And we know this, we can do an experiment to find that out.

36:31.120 --> 36:33.560
 Now, why that is, is a good question,

36:33.560 --> 36:38.240
 but that's the reason why RNA viruses

36:38.240 --> 36:39.400
 are far more successful.

36:39.400 --> 36:42.920
 They infect many more hosts and they're very,

36:42.920 --> 36:44.120
 I would say slippery.

36:44.120 --> 36:46.440
 They can change hosts really quickly,

36:46.440 --> 36:49.480
 because in any animal harboring an RNA virus,

36:50.440 --> 36:52.960
 like let's say a bat in some cave somewhere,

36:52.960 --> 36:55.160
 it's not just one genome.

36:55.160 --> 36:58.680
 It's millions of different genomes of all kinds,

36:58.680 --> 37:01.240
 all within the framework of, say, coronavirus,

37:01.240 --> 37:02.600
 but they're all different.

37:02.600 --> 37:04.760
 And one genome in there might just be right

37:04.760 --> 37:08.200
 for infecting a person if it ever encountered that person.

37:08.200 --> 37:09.400
 I mean, that's the thing that.

37:09.400 --> 37:11.240
 Or there could be a large number.

37:11.240 --> 37:15.000
 This is a tiny fraction, but a large number of them.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.280
 And they're all operating at the threshold of error.

37:18.280 --> 37:19.120
 That's fascinating.

37:19.120 --> 37:21.560
 It's like little, like it's like startups,

37:21.560 --> 37:23.840
 little entrepreneurs, like a startup world.

37:23.840 --> 37:25.160
 Yes, and many of them fail.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.000
 Yeah, many of them fail.

37:26.000 --> 37:26.840
 Many of the changes fail.

37:26.840 --> 37:29.200
 And then there's the DNA viruses that are like the IBM

37:29.200 --> 37:30.520
 and the Google. Exactly, exactly.

37:30.520 --> 37:31.720
 The big corporations.

37:31.720 --> 37:32.560
 That's very good, I like that.

37:32.560 --> 37:34.120
 They become conservative with the bureaucracies

37:34.120 --> 37:34.960
 and all that kind of stuff, so they.

37:34.960 --> 37:36.240
 And a lot of baggage.

37:36.240 --> 37:39.440
 Yeah, yeah, it's expensive for them to reproduce, yeah.

37:39.440 --> 37:40.480
 And they don't move quickly.

37:40.480 --> 37:43.760
 Yes, the RNA viruses are the fast moving members.

37:43.760 --> 37:45.400
 So that's what a virus is.

37:45.400 --> 37:48.840
 We call them ovulated intracellular parasites.

37:48.840 --> 37:50.760
 And then I told you there's DNA and RNA,

37:50.760 --> 37:52.880
 but then let's go further.

37:52.880 --> 37:54.720
 The nucleic acid is not naked.

37:56.120 --> 37:59.800
 Because naked nucleic acid in the world isn't good.

37:59.800 --> 38:03.440
 I mean, it existed in the precellular world,

38:03.440 --> 38:07.080
 but there probably weren't a lot of threats to it then.

38:07.080 --> 38:09.640
 Naked nucleic acid doesn't last long in the environment.

38:09.640 --> 38:12.120
 So they're covered, the nucleic acid is covered.

38:12.120 --> 38:13.920
 It can be covered with a protein shell,

38:13.920 --> 38:18.920
 a pure protein shell, or it can have a membrane around it,

38:18.920 --> 38:22.360
 which would be lipids from the host cell.

38:22.360 --> 38:26.160
 So lipids, so it's a fatty membrane.

38:26.160 --> 38:27.760
 Fatty membrane, yeah, so our cells

38:27.760 --> 38:30.440
 are coated with fatty membranes, right?

38:30.440 --> 38:32.480
 Our cells, the outer plasma membrane, right?

38:32.480 --> 38:33.320
 That's the same.

38:33.320 --> 38:34.320
 Viruses can be too.

38:34.320 --> 38:35.720
 So they're kind of like cells,

38:35.720 --> 38:38.600
 but without the ability to do the mitochondria stuff.

38:38.600 --> 38:41.120
 Some are, they don't have nuclei,

38:41.120 --> 38:42.760
 they don't have mitochondria.

38:42.760 --> 38:45.960
 But they do have a nucleic acid, they have a membrane,

38:45.960 --> 38:48.600
 and then of course there's spikes in the membrane

38:48.600 --> 38:51.200
 that allow them to attach to cells.

38:51.200 --> 38:53.320
 And so that completes our two different kinds.

38:53.320 --> 38:55.720
 So they have, they all have like attachment mechanisms,

38:55.720 --> 38:59.240
 like ways to, like keys into the cell.

38:59.240 --> 39:01.280
 They all have to get into cells.

39:01.280 --> 39:05.160
 There are a couple of exceptions though.

39:05.160 --> 39:10.160
 There are viruses of fungi and plants.

39:10.560 --> 39:11.920
 So let's do the fungi.

39:11.920 --> 39:13.520
 Fungi would be like yeast.

39:13.520 --> 39:17.960
 The yeast cell wall is pretty hard to get through.

39:17.960 --> 39:21.200
 So viruses typically don't attach to a yeast

39:21.200 --> 39:22.040
 and get inside.

39:22.040 --> 39:24.880
 Rather, they just live in the yeast forever.

39:24.880 --> 39:27.920
 And they multiply as mostly nucleic acids,

39:27.920 --> 39:30.600
 and as the yeast divide, they go into the daughter cells.

39:30.600 --> 39:31.840
 And that's how they exist.

39:31.840 --> 39:34.920
 Plant viruses, also the plant cell wall

39:34.920 --> 39:39.760
 would be very hard to get across by binding a protein.

39:39.760 --> 39:43.280
 So plant viruses get into plants either by

39:43.280 --> 39:48.280
 pests that inject them in, they're sucking sap out,

39:48.440 --> 39:49.920
 and they inject virus at the same time.

39:49.920 --> 39:52.600
 Or farmers, they have contaminated farm equipment

39:52.600 --> 39:55.800
 and they roll over the plants and introduces viruses.

39:55.800 --> 39:57.680
 So those fungi and plant viruses,

39:57.680 --> 40:00.520
 they don't have this specific receptor binding

40:00.520 --> 40:01.480
 to get them into the cell.

40:01.480 --> 40:03.560
 But everything else, yeah, the virus binds

40:03.560 --> 40:05.360
 to something on the surface, very specific.

40:05.360 --> 40:09.000
 It's taken into the cell because that's what cells do.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.600
 When things bind their exterior, they take it in.

40:12.600 --> 40:14.280
 Because in most cases, it's good.

40:14.280 --> 40:15.800
 It's something they need.

40:15.800 --> 40:17.200
 And so the virus slips in.

40:17.200 --> 40:19.200
 I guess you'd call that a Trojan horse, right?

40:19.200 --> 40:20.040
 Trojan horse.

40:20.040 --> 40:23.280
 It's so hard to not anthropomorphize this whole thing.

40:23.280 --> 40:24.160
 It is hard.

40:24.160 --> 40:26.960
 So obviously, they don't know any of this.

40:26.960 --> 40:29.400
 It's not an actual Trojan horse.

40:29.400 --> 40:32.760
 So they're not getting actually tricked

40:32.760 --> 40:34.600
 in the way humans trick each other.

40:34.600 --> 40:35.720
 No, it's all passive.

40:35.720 --> 40:38.600
 And it's just through so many years of evolution,

40:38.600 --> 40:42.920
 you select something that works, and it continues.

40:42.920 --> 40:44.920
 And what survives then goes on

40:44.920 --> 40:48.280
 with perhaps a slightly different approach.

40:48.280 --> 40:49.720
 I love this idea of passive.

40:49.720 --> 40:52.040
 Of course, according to Sam Harris,

40:52.040 --> 40:54.840
 so for my sufficiently intelligent alien civilization

40:54.840 --> 40:58.080
 observing humans, our behavior might seem passive too

40:58.080 --> 41:00.800
 because they understand fully exactly what we're doing.

41:00.800 --> 41:02.200
 And then there's no free will,

41:02.200 --> 41:04.040
 and we're all just operating in the same way.

41:04.040 --> 41:04.880
 Could be.

41:04.880 --> 41:07.760
 A cell does, but just a much higher level of complexity.

41:07.760 --> 41:11.760
 Yeah, so I love the distinction between active and passive.

41:11.760 --> 41:14.760
 I mean, the point is, I think anthropomorphizing

41:14.760 --> 41:15.880
 to a certain extent is fine

41:15.880 --> 41:17.800
 because it helps people understand.

41:17.800 --> 41:19.520
 But when you start to say,

41:19.520 --> 41:21.040
 I think the virus is doing that

41:21.040 --> 41:24.640
 because then you're putting a human lens on it,

41:24.640 --> 41:26.200
 and you may be wrong.

41:26.200 --> 41:27.040
 Yeah.

41:27.040 --> 41:29.880
 Because you don't know why things happen for a virus.

41:30.880 --> 41:33.400
 So right now, we have variants emerging,

41:33.400 --> 41:35.920
 and people say, well, I think it's because the antibodies

41:35.920 --> 41:38.120
 are selecting for variants.

41:38.120 --> 41:39.080
 That's a good idea,

41:39.080 --> 41:41.440
 but it may not be the only thing that's going on.

41:41.440 --> 41:44.720
 You start imagining them coming to the table negotiating.

41:45.760 --> 41:47.920
 Yeah, you get into trouble with that.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.320
 That's why I tell my students,

41:49.320 --> 41:51.720
 be careful about the anthropomorphizing

41:51.720 --> 41:55.880
 because you're gonna apply your values to a virus,

41:55.880 --> 41:57.040
 and you have different values.

41:57.040 --> 41:58.920
 You're a human, and you have,

41:58.920 --> 42:01.200
 what you think is the reason for this outcome

42:01.200 --> 42:02.280
 may not be right, that's all.

42:02.280 --> 42:04.160
 Just be open minded about it.

42:04.160 --> 42:05.120
 In both directions.

42:05.120 --> 42:07.680
 I actually, one of the things that pushed back

42:07.680 --> 42:10.360
 on this in the space of robotics,

42:10.360 --> 42:12.280
 people, most people in robotics

42:12.280 --> 42:14.560
 try to not anthropomorphize.

42:14.560 --> 42:17.480
 For example, they don't give a gender or a name to robots.

42:17.480 --> 42:20.000
 They really try to see it as a machine.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.840
 And to me, that makes sense in one way,

42:23.840 --> 42:25.440
 but it totally doesn't make sense in another.

42:25.440 --> 42:27.600
 If that robot is to interact,

42:27.600 --> 42:30.720
 operate in the human world and interact with humans,

42:30.720 --> 42:33.880
 we have to anthropomorphize it

42:33.880 --> 42:37.680
 in order to understand, as an engineering problem,

42:38.880 --> 42:42.080
 how should it operate in a human world?

42:42.080 --> 42:46.000
 Now, the difference with viruses, the scale of operation,

42:46.000 --> 42:49.240
 it doesn't make sense to treat them as humanlike

42:49.240 --> 42:51.560
 because the scale of operations is much smaller.

42:51.560 --> 42:54.240
 But with robots, you're in the same time scale,

42:54.240 --> 42:55.280
 the same spatial scale.

42:55.280 --> 42:56.240
 Of course, in the movies,

42:56.240 --> 42:58.480
 they always give them names and personalities, right?

42:58.480 --> 43:00.400
 Yeah, well, yeah, that's the,

43:00.400 --> 43:02.960
 but that's my argument is we should do the same

43:02.960 --> 43:03.920
 when you're trying to solve

43:03.920 --> 43:06.280
 the engineering problem of robotics too.

43:06.280 --> 43:07.760
 It's not just for the movies.

43:07.760 --> 43:08.800
 Well, let me ask you this,

43:08.800 --> 43:12.280
 because you've said, controversially, not really,

43:12.280 --> 43:14.680
 that viruses are not living.

43:17.160 --> 43:18.200
 Defend yourself.

43:19.360 --> 43:20.600
 Are viruses alive or not?

43:20.600 --> 43:22.880
 So I've seen many people say, oh, they have to be,

43:22.880 --> 43:27.160
 they have nucleic acids, they evolve, they mutate.

43:27.160 --> 43:29.560
 That's all true, but they don't do it on their own.

43:29.560 --> 43:32.200
 The particles in my mug are just not doing any of that

43:32.200 --> 43:33.960
 unless they get into a cell.

43:33.960 --> 43:36.200
 So a virus infected cell is alive.

43:36.200 --> 43:37.800
 I totally agree with that,

43:37.800 --> 43:40.800
 because in fact, when a virus gets in a cell,

43:40.800 --> 43:45.280
 it converts it into a virus making factory, if you will.

43:45.280 --> 43:47.240
 It's no longer a cell.

43:47.240 --> 43:48.920
 Some people call it a viro cell.

43:48.920 --> 43:51.200
 I don't really like that, but it's fine.

43:51.200 --> 43:53.000
 So that's what I'm talking about.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.840
 The particle is not alive.

43:54.840 --> 43:57.760
 You can have your virus infected cell as alive,

43:57.760 --> 44:02.160
 but the particle, it just would not do anything forever

44:02.160 --> 44:03.840
 without getting inside of a cell.

44:03.840 --> 44:07.040
 But once it's in a cell, it is alive then,

44:07.040 --> 44:08.200
 but it's no longer a particle.

44:08.200 --> 44:10.720
 It's taken apart and nucleic acid is moving

44:10.720 --> 44:12.920
 around the cell, it's making proteins.

44:12.920 --> 44:14.080
 Eventually it makes new particles.

44:14.080 --> 44:16.440
 And then those particles released from the cell,

44:16.440 --> 44:17.960
 they're not living anymore.

44:17.960 --> 44:21.320
 So it's kind of, I think it's kind of like a spore,

44:21.320 --> 44:25.200
 a spore of a, or a seed.

44:25.200 --> 44:28.120
 Although the seed just doesn't work because the seeds,

44:28.120 --> 44:29.840
 the cells in the seed have the ability

44:29.840 --> 44:31.920
 to make their own energy and so forth.

44:31.920 --> 44:34.400
 But a bacterial spore, and it's the same thing,

44:34.400 --> 44:36.520
 doesn't do anything unless you add water and nutrients

44:36.520 --> 44:37.560
 and then it starts to divide.

44:37.560 --> 44:39.040
 But it doesn't need to get into a cell.

44:39.040 --> 44:40.640
 It's very different from a virus.

44:40.640 --> 44:42.440
 So that's why the particle.

44:42.440 --> 44:45.280
 And when people think of virus,

44:45.280 --> 44:47.320
 they're always thinking of the particle.

44:47.320 --> 44:49.240
 And that's why I say it can't be alive

44:49.240 --> 44:51.320
 because the particle can't do anything on its own.

44:51.320 --> 44:53.360
 But if you think of a virus as an organism

44:53.360 --> 44:55.880
 with a particle phase in a cell,

44:55.880 --> 44:58.360
 then it makes sense to be alive.

44:58.360 --> 44:59.880
 And by the way, when you say particle,

44:59.880 --> 45:01.160
 you're referring to that structure

45:01.160 --> 45:02.000
 that you've been mentioning,

45:02.000 --> 45:03.440
 some parts of the membrane and not,

45:03.440 --> 45:05.600
 that's been called, what is that,

45:05.600 --> 45:06.800
 a virion particle or something?

45:06.800 --> 45:07.640
 Virion.

45:07.640 --> 45:09.120
 So it's what you should have here.

45:09.120 --> 45:10.280
 I'll send you one.

45:10.280 --> 45:11.720
 And then you can refer to it.

45:11.720 --> 45:13.640
 What's the sexiest one to have?

45:13.640 --> 45:17.920
 Like what, in terms of particles to have on a table?

45:17.920 --> 45:21.400
 Well, unfortunately, the ones that you can 3D print.

45:21.400 --> 45:23.520
 Oh, they're not going to be super.

45:23.520 --> 45:26.360
 They're the ones that we know the structures of, right?

45:26.360 --> 45:29.200
 So someone sent me last year

45:29.200 --> 45:32.000
 a 3D model of SARS CoV2, and it's beautiful.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.720
 It's actually cracked open so you can see the RNA

45:34.720 --> 45:36.960
 and the spikes are sticking out.

45:36.960 --> 45:39.760
 And they even put some antibodies sticking onto the spikes.

45:39.760 --> 45:42.760
 And I mean, when I show this on a live stream,

45:42.760 --> 45:43.600
 people love this.

45:43.600 --> 45:45.080
 They go, oh my God, that's beautiful.

45:45.080 --> 45:46.640
 It is, it's absolutely gorgeous.

45:46.640 --> 45:47.480
 I have that.

45:47.480 --> 45:49.520
 I have my virus that I worked on

45:49.520 --> 45:50.840
 most of my career, poliovirus.

45:50.840 --> 45:54.200
 I have a 3D model of that, which I actually just had made.

45:54.200 --> 45:55.040
 It's gorgeous.

45:55.040 --> 45:57.600
 And you can have it made in any color you want, right?

45:57.600 --> 46:01.480
 What would you say is the most fascinating,

46:01.480 --> 46:05.120
 terrifying, surprising, beautiful virus to you?

46:05.120 --> 46:08.400
 So of all the viruses you looked at,

46:08.400 --> 46:10.920
 sometimes when you just sit late at night

46:10.920 --> 46:13.960
 with a glass of wine looking over the sunset,

46:13.960 --> 46:16.240
 which virus do you think about?

46:16.240 --> 46:21.240
 So fulfilling all of those adjectives is hard, right?

46:21.280 --> 46:24.920
 Fascinating, exciting, terrifying.

46:24.920 --> 46:27.120
 Well, the terrifying is an optional one, I think,

46:27.120 --> 46:30.200
 because maybe that puts a lot of pressure.

46:30.200 --> 46:34.240
 See, terrifying, to me, I'm not terrified

46:34.240 --> 46:37.560
 because I think we can handle most viruses.

46:37.560 --> 46:40.720
 As you see with this brand new one that emerged a year ago,

46:40.720 --> 46:42.400
 we can handle it.

46:42.400 --> 46:44.120
 From a virology perspective.

46:44.120 --> 46:45.600
 Yeah, I mean, the human perspective

46:45.600 --> 46:46.840
 is a different story, right?

46:46.840 --> 46:47.840
 That's always an issue.

46:47.840 --> 46:52.840
 But so I think there are a couple of different categories

46:55.120 --> 46:55.960
 of virus.

46:55.960 --> 46:57.400
 You could do the terrifying,

46:57.400 --> 47:00.080
 and I think rabies is a terrifying virus

47:00.080 --> 47:02.360
 because unless you're vaccinated,

47:02.360 --> 47:04.720
 100% certainty you're gonna die.

47:05.920 --> 47:10.920
 So you get bitten by a rabid raccoon or bat or dog, whatever,

47:11.000 --> 47:15.600
 and there's still 70,000 deaths a year of rabies

47:15.600 --> 47:17.480
 throughout the world because there are a lot of feral dogs

47:17.480 --> 47:19.080
 running around that are infected.

47:19.080 --> 47:21.720
 Unless you're vaccinated, you're gonna die.

47:21.720 --> 47:23.120
 There's nothing we can do.

47:23.120 --> 47:24.480
 But we do have a vaccine

47:24.480 --> 47:26.440
 which we can actually give you

47:26.440 --> 47:27.800
 even after you've been bitten,

47:27.800 --> 47:31.120
 which is the only vaccine that works that way.

47:31.120 --> 47:32.880
 It's a therapeutic, right?

47:32.880 --> 47:34.840
 It will treat your illness

47:34.840 --> 47:37.340
 because the disease takes so long to develop.

47:38.720 --> 47:41.240
 Eventually, you get all kinds of neurological issues

47:41.240 --> 47:44.800
 and paralysis and so forth, but it takes time,

47:44.800 --> 47:45.960
 and you can be vaccinated.

47:45.960 --> 47:47.440
 It will prevent that in the meanwhile.

47:47.440 --> 47:48.400
 So people always say,

47:48.400 --> 47:50.280
 what's the most lethal virus?

47:50.280 --> 47:51.120
 Is it Ebola?

47:51.120 --> 47:53.600
 I said, no, it's actually rabies.

47:53.600 --> 47:56.000
 Unless you're vaccinated, it will kill you.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.800
 Maybe it's good to linger,

47:57.800 --> 48:01.160
 because we'll talk about vaccines a few times today.

48:01.160 --> 48:04.240
 It's good to linger on cases

48:04.240 --> 48:06.560
 where vaccines have clearly,

48:09.040 --> 48:12.280
 undoubtedly helped human civilization.

48:12.280 --> 48:15.400
 And it seems like rabies is a good example.

48:15.400 --> 48:19.000
 Oh, rabies is great because everyone knows what happens

48:19.000 --> 48:21.400
 when somebody gets rabies, right?

48:21.400 --> 48:24.460
 You have fear of water, hydrophobia.

48:26.160 --> 48:31.160
 Your body becomes spastic and stiff and jerks around,

48:31.320 --> 48:33.600
 and you lose consciousness.

48:33.600 --> 48:35.520
 You can't, no more.

48:35.520 --> 48:36.640
 It's not a fun ride to death.

48:36.640 --> 48:37.480
 It's horrible.

48:37.480 --> 48:39.200
 It's a horrible way to die.

48:39.200 --> 48:40.880
 So I think most people know that.

48:40.880 --> 48:44.080
 It's been popularized enough in media, right?

48:44.080 --> 48:47.060
 So that nobody would probably object to getting,

48:47.060 --> 48:51.000
 oh, I was just bit by this raccoon and it ran off.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
 Okay, well, we should assume it's rabid.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.200
 We should immunize you.

48:54.200 --> 48:56.320
 And most people are okay with that,

48:56.320 --> 48:57.560
 because they know the consequences.

48:57.560 --> 48:59.880
 And it's also pretty rare, right?

48:59.880 --> 49:02.120
 It's not like something that you're trying to get

49:02.120 --> 49:06.920
 into the arms of 250, 300 million Americans.

49:06.920 --> 49:07.920
 That's hard.

49:07.920 --> 49:11.680
 But the few thousand every year, it's easy.

49:11.680 --> 49:13.800
 So the transmissibility is difficult, right?

49:13.800 --> 49:16.640
 It has to, oh, it's not airborne.

49:16.640 --> 49:17.480
 It's not airborne.

49:17.480 --> 49:19.880
 It's just you have to be bitten.

49:19.880 --> 49:24.760
 Although some people claim you could walk into a cave

49:24.760 --> 49:28.340
 and the bats breathing out rabies virus could infect you,

49:28.340 --> 49:32.600
 but I don't really think that's well substantiated.

49:32.600 --> 49:33.440
 I think it's a bite.

49:33.440 --> 49:34.800
 How would you do a study on that?

49:34.800 --> 49:36.360
 Yeah, it's very hard to do.

49:36.360 --> 49:38.440
 You'd have to collect the vapors in the cave

49:38.440 --> 49:40.760
 and show that they're infectious, which,

49:40.760 --> 49:43.200
 and by the way, someone emailed me the other day.

49:43.200 --> 49:44.260
 You'll like this.

49:44.260 --> 49:45.760
 They say, why can't we just immunize

49:45.760 --> 49:49.280
 all the bats in the world against these viruses?

49:49.280 --> 49:50.500
 And I said, well, how would you do that?

49:50.500 --> 49:52.320
 There are caves everywhere, right?

49:52.320 --> 49:53.240
 Yeah.

49:53.240 --> 49:56.580
 He said, well, maybe you could just go and aerosolize.

49:56.580 --> 49:57.420
 Yeah.

49:57.420 --> 49:58.440
 It's pretty dangerous.

49:58.440 --> 50:01.480
 And then all the bats should have vaccine passports

50:01.480 --> 50:02.320
 to make sure that they're all.

50:02.320 --> 50:03.840
 Yeah, and I said, you have to get their consent

50:03.840 --> 50:05.340
 before you do it.

50:05.340 --> 50:10.340
 But we do immunize wildlife against rabies.

50:12.060 --> 50:15.040
 We have rabies vaccines for wild animals.

50:15.040 --> 50:17.400
 There are a whole bunch of them that get rabies.

50:17.400 --> 50:19.760
 And we put it in bait

50:19.760 --> 50:21.560
 and drop it from helicopters in the woods

50:21.560 --> 50:25.160
 and it drops down the incidence of rabies in people.

50:25.160 --> 50:27.120
 People hiking, get bitten and so forth,

50:27.120 --> 50:28.000
 it drops the incidence.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
 So we can do that.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.320
 I didn't know that.

50:30.320 --> 50:32.200
 I always wondered how much medical care

50:32.200 --> 50:34.020
 are we doing for animals in the wild

50:34.020 --> 50:37.480
 because I've recently become more and more aware

50:37.480 --> 50:42.000
 that animals are living in extreme poverty, right?

50:42.000 --> 50:45.360
 Like you don't know, you think like natural, it's great.

50:45.360 --> 50:50.360
 Like when animals are living on a farm, it's terrible.

50:51.800 --> 50:53.720
 But then you also have to compare to like

50:53.720 --> 50:56.320
 what life is like in the, or like the zoo.

50:56.320 --> 50:58.760
 You have to compare what life is like in the wild.

50:58.760 --> 51:01.600
 Well, the life in the wild is very tough, I think.

51:01.600 --> 51:03.760
 Most animals have to, well, the carnivores anyway,

51:03.760 --> 51:06.160
 they have to catch their food every day, right?

51:06.160 --> 51:08.200
 And then there's the viruses there.

51:08.200 --> 51:09.200
 Yeah, viruses as well.

51:09.200 --> 51:14.200
 So the rabies immunization is the only one I'm aware of

51:14.200 --> 51:16.360
 for wild animals.

51:17.480 --> 51:20.640
 We do immunize lots of other animals.

51:20.640 --> 51:24.960
 So we immunize chickens and pigs and cows,

51:24.960 --> 51:26.600
 even fish, farmed fish.

51:26.600 --> 51:30.080
 We pick each fish up and give it an injection,

51:30.080 --> 51:32.520
 you know, when it's a small fish.

51:32.520 --> 51:36.220
 But that's mostly so that the farmers get a good yield.

51:36.220 --> 51:38.400
 We don't really care about the animals, right?

51:38.400 --> 51:41.040
 We want a good yield for market.

51:41.040 --> 51:46.040
 And then there's some examples where we immunize animals

51:46.080 --> 51:49.000
 to prevent spillovers into people.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.360
 So there's a disease called Hendra in Australia,

51:53.360 --> 51:57.560
 which was discovered in the 90s.

51:57.560 --> 51:59.720
 And it turns out that there are bats, fruit bats,

51:59.720 --> 52:02.460
 that have this virus, and the bats are fine,

52:02.460 --> 52:05.180
 but sometimes they fly into horse stalls

52:05.180 --> 52:06.720
 and the horses get infected.

52:06.720 --> 52:09.040
 In Australia, it was initially racehorses,

52:09.040 --> 52:11.240
 which are very expensive, right?

52:11.240 --> 52:12.880
 The horses got infected and they died,

52:12.880 --> 52:15.080
 and the humans who would take care of them would die also.

52:15.080 --> 52:19.280
 So now they immunize the horses to prevent the,

52:19.280 --> 52:20.400
 well, to save the horses.

52:20.400 --> 52:21.600
 Probably that's the motivation,

52:21.600 --> 52:23.880
 because these horses are hundreds of thousands of dollars,

52:23.880 --> 52:24.720
 right?

52:24.720 --> 52:25.800
 And then the people don't get sick

52:25.800 --> 52:27.440
 because the horses don't get sick.

52:27.440 --> 52:29.360
 You don't want to immunize all the people

52:29.360 --> 52:30.360
 because it's too rare.

52:30.360 --> 52:33.960
 But that approach is called the one world health approach,

52:33.960 --> 52:37.240
 which means everything's connected on the planet.

52:37.240 --> 52:39.320
 And we have to think of everything in the grander scheme,

52:39.320 --> 52:40.960
 not just us.

52:40.960 --> 52:42.920
 Yeah, so you can immunize some things

52:42.920 --> 52:45.000
 along the trajectory that a virus would take.

52:45.000 --> 52:45.840
 Exactly.

52:45.840 --> 52:48.240
 Some living beings.

52:48.240 --> 52:49.880
 In the Arabian Peninsula,

52:49.880 --> 52:52.640
 they have a MERS coronavirus issue every month.

52:52.640 --> 52:55.840
 There are a couple of cases where a camel

52:55.840 --> 52:59.200
 will infect a human, and the human can get very sick.

52:59.200 --> 53:03.200
 It's a respiratory disease, very much like COVID.

53:03.200 --> 53:05.840
 And so camels are very common there.

53:05.840 --> 53:10.520
 They're raced, they're used as pets, they're eaten.

53:10.520 --> 53:12.560
 So there's a lot of human camel contact.

53:12.560 --> 53:15.120
 But the number of cases are rare, two a month.

53:15.120 --> 53:16.760
 So you don't want to immunize all the humans.

53:16.760 --> 53:18.960
 So the idea would be to immunize the camels.

53:20.320 --> 53:21.160
 So.

53:21.160 --> 53:22.000
 I like it.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.720
 So, okay, so you put rabies.

53:23.720 --> 53:28.720
 But Ebola also is a famously deadly one.

53:30.120 --> 53:30.960
 What is it?

53:30.960 --> 53:33.240
 It kills like, I don't know, 50%, 60% of its.

53:33.240 --> 53:37.120
 It could be 50 to 90, but that's in Africa,

53:37.120 --> 53:38.840
 where the healthcare isn't great.

53:38.840 --> 53:42.880
 You saw when the cases of Ebola came to the U.S.,

53:42.880 --> 53:43.800
 we could take care of it.

53:43.800 --> 53:45.160
 We knew how to take care of it.

53:45.160 --> 53:46.800
 We had fancy hospitals and so forth,

53:46.800 --> 53:49.960
 and now we have a vaccine, so we can.

53:49.960 --> 53:52.280
 And the vaccine is really good,

53:52.280 --> 53:54.960
 but there are many governments in Africa

53:54.960 --> 53:56.960
 that are suspicious of us,

53:56.960 --> 53:58.960
 and they don't want to use our vaccine, so they.

53:58.960 --> 54:00.640
 So there's a vaccine for Ebola.

54:00.640 --> 54:01.480
 There is, yeah.

54:01.480 --> 54:04.520
 And the effectiveness and safety of it,

54:04.520 --> 54:06.400
 to how much is understood.

54:06.400 --> 54:08.480
 So this is difficult,

54:08.480 --> 54:11.880
 because there's not a lot of Ebola, right?

54:11.880 --> 54:14.040
 It's not a continuous, ongoing thing.

54:14.040 --> 54:16.560
 There are sporadic outbreaks here and there.

54:16.560 --> 54:17.640
 Of a few thousand people.

54:17.640 --> 54:19.840
 At most, at most, usually a few hundred.

54:19.840 --> 54:23.000
 And the biggest ever, in fact,

54:23.000 --> 54:25.440
 this is why we didn't for years have an Ebola vaccine.

54:25.440 --> 54:27.880
 The U.S. military, together with Canada,

54:27.880 --> 54:30.560
 developed an Ebola vaccine for service people, right?

54:30.560 --> 54:32.120
 They wanted to say, well, we're sending people

54:32.120 --> 54:34.680
 into these Ebola areas, we want a vaccine for them.

54:34.680 --> 54:38.120
 So they had developed it through all the preclinical,

54:38.120 --> 54:40.960
 which means before it goes into people.

54:40.960 --> 54:43.240
 And that stopped, because there was no money

54:43.240 --> 54:46.320
 to do a phase one and a phase two and a phase three.

54:46.320 --> 54:47.800
 In fact, for phase two and three,

54:47.800 --> 54:49.480
 you need to have infections going on,

54:49.480 --> 54:50.760
 because you're looking at how well

54:50.760 --> 54:52.960
 the vaccine prevents infections, right?

54:52.960 --> 54:57.000
 So then there was a West African outbreak in 2015.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.680
 2013, 2015.

54:58.680 --> 55:00.720
 The most cases ever, 25,000.

55:00.720 --> 55:02.440
 So they got to test the vaccine.

55:03.640 --> 55:07.400
 But they only put it in a few thousand people.

55:07.400 --> 55:10.480
 It's not like it's been in hundreds of thousands of people

55:10.480 --> 55:12.080
 like the COVID vaccines has been.

55:12.080 --> 55:15.720
 So it looks like it has high efficacy.

55:16.600 --> 55:18.560
 But we'd like to have more data.

55:18.560 --> 55:21.440
 Side effects maybe are not so great.

55:21.440 --> 55:23.560
 There are a couple of different available vaccines.

55:23.560 --> 55:25.840
 Some have been tested more than others.

55:25.840 --> 55:29.760
 I would say this would probably not be widely accepted

55:29.760 --> 55:31.440
 in the US.

55:31.440 --> 55:36.440
 But then neither would be something over 50%

55:36.840 --> 55:38.440
 deadliness of a virus.

55:38.440 --> 55:41.240
 No, I think if you were, in fact, many physicians

55:41.240 --> 55:43.280
 work in countries that have Ebola,

55:43.280 --> 55:45.960
 so they get vaccinated, because they understand the choice.

55:45.960 --> 55:48.480
 Yeah, right, it's always about the choice.

55:48.480 --> 55:49.400
 So.

55:49.400 --> 55:50.680
 So then one more thing.

55:50.680 --> 55:53.200
 To answer the interesting,

55:53.200 --> 55:57.000
 what are some of the viruses you really are fascinated by?

55:57.000 --> 56:01.240
 There are a number of viruses that have clearly been shown

56:01.240 --> 56:04.600
 to alter host behavior, and that's how they spread.

56:04.600 --> 56:05.840
 I think those are fascinating.

56:05.840 --> 56:09.960
 For example, there are some viruses of plants

56:11.080 --> 56:13.400
 that are spread by aphids.

56:14.920 --> 56:16.760
 And the aphid bites the plant,

56:16.760 --> 56:18.880
 the virus reproduces in the plant,

56:18.880 --> 56:21.640
 and it somehow engineers the plant

56:21.640 --> 56:26.440
 to give off volatile organics to attract more aphids,

56:26.440 --> 56:28.040
 which will spread the virus.

56:30.080 --> 56:31.440
 Isn't that amazing?

56:31.440 --> 56:32.280
 Yeah.

56:32.280 --> 56:33.960
 So that's altering the behavior.

56:35.080 --> 56:38.640
 Altering because somehow the virus infecting the plant cells

56:38.640 --> 56:40.760
 gives off these organics and attracts aphids.

56:40.760 --> 56:44.720
 And furthermore, somehow when the aphid bites,

56:44.720 --> 56:46.280
 it tastes horrible.

56:46.280 --> 56:48.400
 So they immediately leave with the virus

56:48.400 --> 56:51.240
 they've just picked up and go to another plant to spread it.

56:51.240 --> 56:53.760
 So they're attracted and then repulsed at the same time.

56:53.760 --> 56:55.920
 And obviously you don't want to anthropomorphize this

56:55.920 --> 56:57.560
 like a strategy they're taking on.

56:57.560 --> 56:58.680
 Somehow this worked out.

56:58.680 --> 56:59.840
 It worked out this way.

56:59.840 --> 57:00.680
 It just evolved.

57:00.680 --> 57:04.280
 And you know, evolution is sometimes hard to trace, right?

57:04.280 --> 57:06.320
 Like Darwin famously said,

57:06.320 --> 57:08.240
 he could never figure out how an eye evolved

57:08.240 --> 57:09.320
 from a single cell, right?

57:09.320 --> 57:11.160
 But it did.

57:11.160 --> 57:16.120
 The more complicated, complex the holistic organism is

57:16.120 --> 57:18.120
 that the virus invades,

57:18.120 --> 57:21.360
 the less able it is to control that organism, right?

57:21.360 --> 57:22.600
 So I wonder if there's viruses

57:22.600 --> 57:24.480
 that can control human behavior,

57:26.800 --> 57:31.360
 you know, to induce more spread of the virus.

57:32.880 --> 57:34.320
 Well, I don't see why not.

57:34.320 --> 57:35.160
 There's not enough humans

57:35.160 --> 57:37.080
 that's supposed to like evolve through.

57:37.080 --> 57:39.240
 Well, we can't do the experiment to test it, right?

57:39.240 --> 57:40.080
 We have to observe.

57:40.080 --> 57:41.720
 And that's always hard when you're observing

57:41.720 --> 57:45.040
 because there's so many things that can confound

57:45.040 --> 57:45.880
 what you're looking at.

57:45.880 --> 57:47.520
 Yeah, change human behavior, yeah.

57:47.520 --> 57:50.360
 I mean, there's so many things that impinge on our behavior,

57:50.360 --> 57:54.960
 but yeah, I think it's possible.

57:54.960 --> 57:56.520
 I think it's highly possible.

57:56.520 --> 57:58.000
 If it does it in a plant,

57:58.000 --> 58:00.800
 why not change some other organism's behavior?

58:00.800 --> 58:01.640
 I think it's fine.

58:01.640 --> 58:02.480
 Anyway, those fascinate me.

58:02.480 --> 58:06.080
 There are lots of examples of those that are fascinating

58:06.080 --> 58:08.840
 and how they work, people are trying to figure out.

58:08.840 --> 58:10.680
 But there's not a lot of money to work on, you know,

58:10.680 --> 58:13.560
 insect and plant viruses unless you're going to the USDA.

58:13.560 --> 58:17.120
 So they don't get a lot of work moving forward.

58:17.120 --> 58:19.800
 Well, is there, if you understand some of those viruses,

58:19.800 --> 58:23.760
 is that transferable to human viruses, that understanding?

58:23.760 --> 58:25.560
 I think some of it could be, sure.

58:25.560 --> 58:28.160
 I think the general principles, for example,

58:28.160 --> 58:32.280
 how does the virus cause volatile organics to be made?

58:32.280 --> 58:34.960
 It must be turning on some genes

58:34.960 --> 58:37.400
 and you could learn principles from that,

58:37.400 --> 58:38.720
 how the virus might do that.

58:38.720 --> 58:41.320
 Sure, I think everything is broadly applicable.

58:41.320 --> 58:46.200
 So to say it's not useful to study viruses of insects

58:46.200 --> 58:49.280
 and plants is just wrong because in science,

58:49.280 --> 58:52.880
 we probably know this, maybe in your field it's the same.

58:52.880 --> 58:55.040
 If you're curious, you're going to run into interesting

58:55.040 --> 58:57.160
 things that you never planned on, right?

58:57.160 --> 58:59.680
 That's why people like, you can criticize,

58:59.680 --> 59:01.280
 why do we want to go on Mars?

59:01.280 --> 59:03.560
 Why do we want to colonize Mars?

59:03.560 --> 59:06.600
 Well, it's like, why do you want to go to the moon?

59:06.600 --> 59:10.520
 The reality is when you do really difficult things,

59:10.520 --> 59:13.080
 engineering things, like all these inventions

59:13.080 --> 59:14.320
 along the way are created.

59:14.320 --> 59:16.080
 It's kind of fascinating.

59:16.080 --> 59:21.080
 Basically just pick a thing that everyone can agree

59:21.120 --> 59:24.440
 is kind of cool and is really hard and do that.

59:24.440 --> 59:26.920
 And then you'll have like thousands of inventions

59:26.920 --> 59:28.200
 that have nothing to do with the thing.

59:28.200 --> 59:29.040
 That's right.

59:29.040 --> 59:32.040
 I think you should let curious scientists

59:32.040 --> 59:34.440
 just follow what they're interested in

59:34.440 --> 59:35.280
 to a certain extent.

59:35.280 --> 59:38.880
 You can't, in science we say we have translational research

59:38.880 --> 59:40.200
 where we say, okay, here's some money,

59:40.200 --> 59:43.600
 go cure cancer or diabetes or heart disease, whatever.

59:43.600 --> 59:44.520
 And that's fine.

59:44.520 --> 59:46.680
 But that often doesn't work out very well.

59:46.680 --> 59:49.840
 What works better is to say, you have a good lab,

59:49.840 --> 59:50.800
 you have a good track record,

59:50.800 --> 59:52.960
 here's some money, here's something.

59:52.960 --> 59:56.840
 And that's where PCR, CRISPR, recombinant DNA,

59:56.840 --> 59:59.840
 all that stuff which has made the field explode,

59:59.840 --> 1:00:00.760
 that's all it came from.

1:00:00.760 --> 1:00:04.280
 Not from people saying, I want to cure genetic diseases

1:00:04.280 --> 1:00:05.840
 by gene editing, but by saying,

1:00:05.840 --> 1:00:09.800
 what are these repeated things in this bacterium doing?

1:00:09.800 --> 1:00:11.120
 Yep.

1:00:11.120 --> 1:00:14.640
 Can I ask you a big philosophical question?

1:00:14.640 --> 1:00:17.200
 So there's these deadly viruses

1:00:17.200 --> 1:00:21.520
 that are not very transmissible, Ebola, rabies.

1:00:21.520 --> 1:00:23.800
 And then there's these less deadly viruses

1:00:23.800 --> 1:00:28.800
 that are very transmissible, like COVID,

1:00:29.200 --> 1:00:31.000
 I guess kind of borderline.

1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:35.560
 But why isn't there super transmissible,

1:00:35.560 --> 1:00:37.120
 super deadly viruses?

1:00:38.360 --> 1:00:40.360
 I think if you compare SARS one and two,

1:00:40.360 --> 1:00:42.600
 you get somewhat of an answer, right?

1:00:42.600 --> 1:00:45.560
 SARS one was more deadly.

1:00:45.560 --> 1:00:50.400
 In fact, over half of the time when people were infected,

1:00:50.400 --> 1:00:53.440
 they ended up in the hospital because they were that sick.

1:00:53.440 --> 1:00:57.400
 And then the peak of virus shedding from them

1:00:57.400 --> 1:00:59.640
 happened long after they went in the hospital.

1:00:59.640 --> 1:01:02.760
 So it's easy to contain the infection

1:01:02.760 --> 1:01:04.640
 when you're in a hospital, right?

1:01:04.640 --> 1:01:07.480
 There was not much pre symptomatic

1:01:07.480 --> 1:01:11.360
 or asymptomatic shedding with SARS one.

1:01:11.360 --> 1:01:14.000
 And shedding means you become infectious.

1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:16.040
 So in a respiratory virus,

1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:18.160
 you inhale the droplets with the virus

1:01:18.160 --> 1:01:20.840
 and they reproduce in your upper respiratory tract,

1:01:20.840 --> 1:01:22.920
 what we call the nasopharynx, right?

1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:24.880
 The nose and going back to that little cavity

1:01:24.880 --> 1:01:27.000
 just above your mouth.

1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:28.440
 So the virus reproduces really well.

1:01:28.440 --> 1:01:30.120
 And then as you talk and sneeze and cough,

1:01:30.120 --> 1:01:32.560
 you expel droplets and then those are inhaled

1:01:32.560 --> 1:01:35.160
 by other people and then they reproduce.

1:01:35.160 --> 1:01:39.640
 And for SARS two, we now know there's a lot of reproduction

1:01:39.640 --> 1:01:42.320
 just before you feel anything, if at all.

1:01:42.320 --> 1:01:45.560
 So there's a lot of shedding and transmission

1:01:45.560 --> 1:01:47.680
 before you get symptomatic.

1:01:47.680 --> 1:01:50.200
 And as many people don't ever get symptomatic, right?

1:01:50.200 --> 1:01:52.840
 So they spread really easily.

1:01:52.840 --> 1:01:55.960
 So that explains why some viruses can transmit

1:01:55.960 --> 1:01:57.360
 a lot better than others.

1:01:57.360 --> 1:02:00.040
 And if one happens to knock you out,

1:02:00.040 --> 1:02:01.400
 then you're never gonna transmit

1:02:01.400 --> 1:02:03.400
 because you're in the hospital like SARS one.

1:02:03.400 --> 1:02:05.840
 But why can't you have both?

1:02:05.840 --> 1:02:08.680
 Why can't you just wait a while before it knocks you out

1:02:08.680 --> 1:02:10.800
 but when it knocks you out, it really kills you?

1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:13.200
 That is a philosophical question, right?

1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:16.640
 Because we could talk about why we haven't observed it.

1:02:16.640 --> 1:02:21.640
 I mean, one issue is that if you're killed too quickly

1:02:23.480 --> 1:02:25.840
 by a highly lethal virus,

1:02:25.840 --> 1:02:27.920
 you're not gonna transmit it very well, right?

1:02:27.920 --> 1:02:31.040
 So Ebola can kill you quite rapidly.

1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:35.840
 And most of the transmission occurs when people

1:02:35.840 --> 1:02:38.640
 are being cared for at home or in hospitals.

1:02:38.640 --> 1:02:40.440
 The doctors and nurses get the virus,

1:02:40.440 --> 1:02:42.880
 but people walking around, you're not walking around

1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:45.160
 when you have Ebola, you're too sick.

1:02:45.160 --> 1:02:47.360
 You know, you have black, bloody diarrhea,

1:02:47.360 --> 1:02:51.680
 you're vomiting, you're bleeding from your skin

1:02:51.680 --> 1:02:54.360
 and mucous membranes, you're not walking around,

1:02:54.360 --> 1:02:55.440
 you're not going to parties.

1:02:55.440 --> 1:02:57.920
 So I think that's part of it,

1:02:57.920 --> 1:03:00.400
 that if the infection is too lethal,

1:03:00.400 --> 1:03:02.520
 you're simply not a good transmitter.

1:03:02.520 --> 1:03:05.880
 And I think transmission is probably one

1:03:05.880 --> 1:03:09.720
 of the most powerful selection forces for viruses

1:03:09.720 --> 1:03:12.720
 because a virus always has to find a new host.

1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:16.400
 If it doesn't, it's a startup that fails, right?

1:03:16.400 --> 1:03:18.560
 If it doesn't find a new host, it's gone.

1:03:18.560 --> 1:03:22.520
 And so anything that makes the virus transmit better

1:03:22.520 --> 1:03:23.600
 is gonna help it.

1:03:23.600 --> 1:03:27.480
 And if killing you, being less lethal is part of that,

1:03:27.480 --> 1:03:28.360
 that works too.

1:03:28.360 --> 1:03:30.720
 So there's a strong selection pressure

1:03:30.720 --> 1:03:32.360
 against being lethal.

1:03:32.360 --> 1:03:34.880
 I think there's a strong selection pressure

1:03:34.880 --> 1:03:38.680
 against being lethal and being more transmissible.

1:03:38.680 --> 1:03:41.600
 Those two seem to work in opposite ways.

1:03:41.600 --> 1:03:43.440
 And now we don't have a lot of data to support this.

1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:46.520
 This is kind of a thought experiment,

1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:49.600
 but there is one experiment done in Australia

1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:51.840
 many years ago.

1:03:51.840 --> 1:03:54.720
 I don't know if you know this, but in the 1800s,

1:03:54.720 --> 1:03:57.400
 the hunters in Australia imported a rabbit from Europe

1:03:57.400 --> 1:04:00.560
 so they could hunt it because the native rabbit

1:04:00.560 --> 1:04:02.000
 in Australia was too fast for them.

1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:03.440
 They couldn't shoot them.

1:04:03.440 --> 1:04:05.560
 So they brought in this European rabbit

1:04:05.560 --> 1:04:07.800
 and they reproduced out of control.

1:04:07.800 --> 1:04:10.320
 Within a couple of years, they were everywhere,

1:04:10.320 --> 1:04:13.440
 millions of rabbits in all the watering holes.

1:04:13.440 --> 1:04:14.960
 And now they had a problem.

1:04:14.960 --> 1:04:16.520
 So they decided to use a virus

1:04:16.520 --> 1:04:19.120
 to get rid of these excess rabbits.

1:04:19.120 --> 1:04:22.880
 And they used a virus, a pox virus called myxoma virus,

1:04:22.880 --> 1:04:26.240
 which is a natural virus of a different kind of rabbit.

1:04:26.240 --> 1:04:28.640
 But for these European rabbits, it was quite lethal

1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:30.080
 and it's spread by mosquitoes.

1:04:30.080 --> 1:04:33.840
 So they said, okay, let's release this virus.

1:04:33.840 --> 1:04:38.840
 And the first year, 99.2% of the rabbits were killed,

1:04:40.320 --> 1:04:45.120
 but that 0.8% that were left had some form of resistance.

1:04:45.120 --> 1:04:46.360
 They were variants.

1:04:46.360 --> 1:04:49.040
 Every organism, not just viruses, makes mutants.

1:04:49.040 --> 1:04:51.000
 And there were some variants of the rabbits

1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:52.760
 that could survive infection.

1:04:52.760 --> 1:04:56.560
 And then in subsequent years, the virus became less lethal.

1:04:56.560 --> 1:04:59.120
 And then the mosquitoes had a better shot

1:04:59.120 --> 1:05:01.120
 of transmitting it from one rabbit to another

1:05:01.120 --> 1:05:02.320
 if the rabbit lived longer.

1:05:02.320 --> 1:05:04.200
 That's the selection probably.

1:05:04.200 --> 1:05:06.520
 And so in the end, the rabbits lived on.

1:05:06.520 --> 1:05:07.480
 The virus was there.

1:05:07.480 --> 1:05:11.440
 It evolved to be more transmissible and less lethal.

1:05:11.440 --> 1:05:12.280
 So that's the only.

1:05:12.280 --> 1:05:13.160
 Life is amazing.

1:05:13.160 --> 1:05:15.080
 That's the only data. Life on Earth is amazing.

1:05:15.080 --> 1:05:15.920
 It is, it is.

1:05:15.920 --> 1:05:19.440
 If you take the time to look at it and see what's happened,

1:05:19.440 --> 1:05:20.760
 it is amazing.

1:05:20.760 --> 1:05:22.720
 It's also humbling that it just makes you realize

1:05:22.720 --> 1:05:25.280
 humans are just a small part of the picture.

1:05:25.280 --> 1:05:26.360
 Of course.

1:05:26.360 --> 1:05:28.320
 And we're wrecking it, aren't we?

1:05:28.320 --> 1:05:32.520
 Well, I mean, we're not really.

1:05:32.520 --> 1:05:35.400
 I mean, viruses are wrecking it some ways.

1:05:35.400 --> 1:05:36.880
 We're not really wrecking anything.

1:05:36.880 --> 1:05:38.240
 It's all part of it.

1:05:38.240 --> 1:05:41.480
 But you know, when the ways that humans exist

1:05:41.480 --> 1:05:43.960
 encourages viruses to infect us, right?

1:05:43.960 --> 1:05:45.840
 When we were hunter gatherers,

1:05:45.840 --> 1:05:49.640
 living in bands of 100 people, very few viruses

1:05:49.640 --> 1:05:51.760
 because it was hard for the virus to go

1:05:51.760 --> 1:05:53.200
 from one band to another.

1:05:53.200 --> 1:05:55.840
 And perhaps a hunter would, one of these humans

1:05:55.840 --> 1:05:58.600
 would get an animal and bring a virus into camp

1:05:58.600 --> 1:05:59.560
 and some people would die,

1:05:59.560 --> 1:06:02.160
 but it would never spread to another.

1:06:02.160 --> 1:06:04.480
 And then when we started to congregate in cities,

1:06:04.480 --> 1:06:06.640
 we figured out agriculture and so forth

1:06:06.640 --> 1:06:07.760
 and how to harvest animals,

1:06:07.760 --> 1:06:09.480
 then we could get bigger and bigger populations

1:06:09.480 --> 1:06:10.960
 and the viruses went crazy.

1:06:10.960 --> 1:06:12.560
 And they went from animals to us.

1:06:12.560 --> 1:06:15.120
 So measles went from cows to humans

1:06:15.120 --> 1:06:17.480
 when humans learned to domesticate cows

1:06:17.480 --> 1:06:20.680
 and started gathering in big cities.

1:06:20.680 --> 1:06:24.880
 Yeah, but now that humans are able to communicate

1:06:24.880 --> 1:06:26.960
 and travel globally,

1:06:26.960 --> 1:06:30.240
 the viruses become more and more dangerous, transmissible.

1:06:31.760 --> 1:06:33.960
 Thereby, if you look at earth as an organism,

1:06:33.960 --> 1:06:36.800
 thereby pushing humans to be more innovative,

1:06:36.800 --> 1:06:39.600
 create alpha fold two and three and four and five,

1:06:39.600 --> 1:06:41.800
 create better systems and eventually there's rockets

1:06:41.800 --> 1:06:43.960
 that keep flying from earth.

1:06:43.960 --> 1:06:47.480
 And eventually the virus is becoming super dangerous

1:06:47.480 --> 1:06:49.680
 and threatening all of human civilization,

1:06:49.680 --> 1:06:52.520
 will force it to become a multi planetary species

1:06:52.520 --> 1:06:54.520
 and its organism starts expanding.

1:06:54.520 --> 1:06:57.520
 So I think it's a feature, not a bug, I don't know.

1:06:57.520 --> 1:07:00.720
 Well, I think that we have our early,

1:07:00.720 --> 1:07:03.120
 probably the most of the,

1:07:03.120 --> 1:07:06.120
 we're studying viruses since 1900, right?

1:07:06.120 --> 1:07:09.680
 Most of that time was because of diseases they caused.

1:07:09.680 --> 1:07:12.920
 The first viruses discovered, yellow fever,

1:07:12.920 --> 1:07:17.920
 virus, smallpox, polio virus, influenza virus,

1:07:17.920 --> 1:07:21.520
 those were all because people got sick and they said,

1:07:21.520 --> 1:07:24.560
 oh, look, this is a virus that's associated with it.

1:07:24.560 --> 1:07:28.840
 And so we got good at learning how to take care

1:07:28.840 --> 1:07:31.040
 of these infections, making vaccines and so forth

1:07:31.040 --> 1:07:33.240
 over the years and it's only in the last 20 years

1:07:33.240 --> 1:07:36.120
 that we recognize that there are more viruses out there

1:07:36.120 --> 1:07:38.240
 that are far more interesting, perhaps,

1:07:38.240 --> 1:07:41.120
 but we've learned how to deal with the bad ones for sure.

1:07:41.120 --> 1:07:43.480
 So we talked about what is a virus.

1:07:43.480 --> 1:07:45.560
 We talked about some of the most dangerous

1:07:45.560 --> 1:07:47.080
 and deadly viruses.

1:07:47.080 --> 1:07:51.320
 Can we zoom in and talk about COVID 19 virus?

1:07:51.320 --> 1:07:52.160
 Sure.

1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:54.400
 I don't know what your preferred name is, but maybe for this.

1:07:54.400 --> 1:07:58.360
 Right, the virus is SARS CoV2, which is hard, it's long,

1:07:58.360 --> 1:08:00.440
 and then COVID 19 is the disease.

1:08:00.440 --> 1:08:03.280
 So you could say the virus of COVID 19, that's fine.

1:08:03.280 --> 1:08:04.680
 The virus of COVID 19.

1:08:04.680 --> 1:08:06.240
 But for the purpose of this conversation,

1:08:06.240 --> 1:08:08.320
 we'll every once in a while just say COVID.

1:08:08.320 --> 1:08:10.480
 It's fine, no problem.

1:08:10.480 --> 1:08:12.760
 What is this virus from,

1:08:14.280 --> 1:08:16.640
 I don't know how many ways we can talk about it.

1:08:16.640 --> 1:08:19.680
 I think from a basic structural,

1:08:19.680 --> 1:08:22.960
 like the variant structure,

1:08:22.960 --> 1:08:25.920
 biological structure perspective, what is it?

1:08:25.920 --> 1:08:28.080
 What are its variants?

1:08:28.080 --> 1:08:30.080
 Can you describe the basics,

1:08:30.080 --> 1:08:32.040
 the important characteristics of the virus?

1:08:32.040 --> 1:08:35.020
 So viruses are classified by humans

1:08:35.020 --> 1:08:38.280
 just to make it easier to keep track of them, right?

1:08:38.280 --> 1:08:42.340
 So this is a coronavirus, which is because

1:08:42.340 --> 1:08:45.160
 when they were first discovered,

1:08:45.160 --> 1:08:48.280
 I think the first ones were animal coronaviruses.

1:08:48.280 --> 1:08:50.440
 They looked at them in the electron microscope

1:08:50.440 --> 1:08:51.960
 and it looked like the solar corona,

1:08:51.960 --> 1:08:53.480
 and that's all there is to it.

1:08:53.480 --> 1:08:56.320
 And I have to say that early in the outbreak,

1:08:56.320 --> 1:09:00.240
 the place with the highest seropositivity in the US,

1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:03.800
 for a while, 68% was a working class neighborhood

1:09:03.800 --> 1:09:05.500
 in New York City called corona.

1:09:06.520 --> 1:09:08.120
 Can you beat that, right?

1:09:08.120 --> 1:09:09.600
 That's crazy, yeah.

1:09:09.600 --> 1:09:12.220
 So coronaviruses, they have membranes, right?

1:09:12.220 --> 1:09:13.160
 We talked about membranes,

1:09:13.160 --> 1:09:15.000
 they have spike proteins in the membrane,

1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:16.320
 so they can attach to cells.

1:09:16.320 --> 1:09:19.040
 And inside, they have RNA.

1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:22.000
 And they are the viruses with the longest RNA

1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:23.400
 that we know of.

1:09:23.400 --> 1:09:25.120
 None other comes close.

1:09:25.120 --> 1:09:29.640
 For some reason, they're able to maintain 30,000,

1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:33.860
 so SARS, COVID, two RNAs, 30,000 bases of RNA,

1:09:33.860 --> 1:09:37.240
 and some of the other coronas are even longer, 40,000.

1:09:37.240 --> 1:09:40.920
 This is a, coronas are family of viruses

1:09:40.920 --> 1:09:45.920
 that included the one you mentioned before, version one.

1:09:46.320 --> 1:09:47.800
 So SARS, COVID one, yeah.

1:09:47.800 --> 1:09:49.640
 COVID one, and I guess other ones as well.

1:09:49.640 --> 1:09:52.520
 So the first, we first learned of them in animals,

1:09:52.520 --> 1:09:56.360
 a lot of animals, pigs, and cows,

1:09:56.360 --> 1:09:58.240
 and horses have coronaviruses.

1:09:58.240 --> 1:10:01.440
 And then in the 60s, we discovered

1:10:01.440 --> 1:10:05.220
 a couple of human coronaviruses that just cause colds,

1:10:05.220 --> 1:10:08.920
 very mild colds that you wouldn't even think twice about.

1:10:08.920 --> 1:10:13.920
 And then suddenly, in 2003, there's this outbreak

1:10:14.160 --> 1:10:18.600
 of severe respiratory disease in China.

1:10:18.600 --> 1:10:21.560
 And it started in November,

1:10:21.560 --> 1:10:24.000
 and they didn't tell the world until February.

1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:27.220
 And that was really bad, because it was already spreading

1:10:27.220 --> 1:10:30.080
 by the time they told people about it.

1:10:30.080 --> 1:10:34.600
 But this went to 29 different countries.

1:10:34.600 --> 1:10:37.480
 Only 8,000 people were infected, and then it stopped.

1:10:37.480 --> 1:10:42.480
 And that was the first time we saw an epidemic coronavirus.

1:10:43.060 --> 1:10:45.780
 And what they did afterwards is they said,

1:10:45.780 --> 1:10:48.380
 okay, it looks like it came from the meat markets.

1:10:48.380 --> 1:10:50.620
 They have live meat markets in Guangzhou,

1:10:50.620 --> 1:10:53.220
 in the south of China, where you can go

1:10:53.220 --> 1:10:56.440
 and pick out an animal and the guy will slaughter it for you

1:10:56.440 --> 1:10:57.780
 and give it to you, and then of course,

1:10:57.780 --> 1:11:00.580
 there's blood everywhere, and that's how they got infected.

1:11:00.580 --> 1:11:02.760
 And they figured out that there's this animal

1:11:02.760 --> 1:11:05.780
 called a palm civet, that was the source of virus.

1:11:05.780 --> 1:11:08.460
 The palm civets are shipped in from the countryside,

1:11:08.460 --> 1:11:10.660
 and the palm civets somehow in the countryside

1:11:10.660 --> 1:11:11.700
 got it from a bat.

1:11:11.700 --> 1:11:13.900
 So they went looking in caves in the countryside,

1:11:13.900 --> 1:11:16.860
 and they found in one cave all the viruses

1:11:16.860 --> 1:11:19.140
 that could make up SARS 1.

1:11:19.140 --> 1:11:21.620
 And that was 2000, and I would say,

1:11:21.620 --> 1:11:24.340
 took about five, eight years after that outbreak.

1:11:24.340 --> 1:11:29.340
 So that was the first hint that bats have coronaviruses

1:11:30.040 --> 1:11:32.940
 that can infect people and cause problems, right?

1:11:32.940 --> 1:11:35.620
 And after that, we should have been ready.

1:11:35.620 --> 1:11:37.580
 So didn't they already start developing

1:11:37.580 --> 1:11:38.860
 vaccines after then? Yes.

1:11:38.860 --> 1:11:41.300
 So some people started making vaccines.

1:11:41.300 --> 1:11:46.300
 They tested them in mice, but they never got into people.

1:11:46.780 --> 1:11:50.860
 And some people started working on antiviral drugs.

1:11:50.860 --> 1:11:54.140
 Nothing ever came of them because, you know,

1:11:54.140 --> 1:11:57.460
 industry, there's no disease, it's gone.

1:11:57.460 --> 1:11:59.420
 Why should we make vaccines and drugs?

1:11:59.420 --> 1:12:02.540
 And NIH in the US, you submit a grant,

1:12:02.540 --> 1:12:03.960
 and they say, ah, it's too risky.

1:12:03.960 --> 1:12:05.520
 There's none of this virus around.

1:12:05.520 --> 1:12:08.180
 So people were really shortsighted because I always say,

1:12:08.180 --> 1:12:13.060
 we could have had antivirals for this, absolutely, for sure.

1:12:13.060 --> 1:12:14.260
 No question.

1:12:14.260 --> 1:12:17.180
 In fact, the one antiviral that's in phase three,

1:12:17.180 --> 1:12:20.220
 it's called molnupiravir.

1:12:20.220 --> 1:12:22.260
 It's the only one that you can take orally.

1:12:22.260 --> 1:12:23.100
 It's a pill.

1:12:23.100 --> 1:12:24.220
 It looks really good.

1:12:24.220 --> 1:12:26.340
 That was developed five years ago,

1:12:26.340 --> 1:12:27.980
 but never taken into humans.

1:12:27.980 --> 1:12:29.340
 It could have been ready.

1:12:29.340 --> 1:12:33.940
 So we dropped the ball, and then the next decade, 2012,

1:12:33.940 --> 1:12:38.900
 MERS coronavirus comes up in the Arabian Peninsula.

1:12:38.900 --> 1:12:41.580
 This comes from camels and infects people,

1:12:41.580 --> 1:12:44.820
 but probably the camels got it from bats originally

1:12:44.820 --> 1:12:46.260
 some time ago.

1:12:46.260 --> 1:12:50.580
 But that never transmits from person to person, very rarely.

1:12:50.580 --> 1:12:54.560
 Every new little outbreak is a new infection from a camel.

1:12:55.460 --> 1:12:59.260
 So that was 2012, and now here we are, 2019,

1:12:59.260 --> 1:13:02.680
 the new outbreak of respiratory disease in China.

1:13:02.680 --> 1:13:06.420
 And this one really goes all over the world

1:13:06.420 --> 1:13:07.780
 where SARS1 could not.

1:13:07.780 --> 1:13:09.380
 It's a coronavirus.

1:13:09.380 --> 1:13:11.100
 It's different enough from SARS1

1:13:11.100 --> 1:13:12.940
 that it has very different properties.

1:13:12.940 --> 1:13:13.780
 Causes a lot.

1:13:13.780 --> 1:13:14.620
 But it still has a membrane.

1:13:14.620 --> 1:13:17.820
 It still has a very long RNA in the middle,

1:13:17.820 --> 1:13:19.900
 and then it still has the spike proteins.

1:13:19.900 --> 1:13:20.740
 That's right.

1:13:20.740 --> 1:13:22.460
 What are the things that are,

1:13:22.460 --> 1:13:24.780
 what are the little unique things

1:13:24.780 --> 1:13:27.740
 that make it that much more effective?

1:13:27.740 --> 1:13:30.940
 That make it cause a pandemic of millions of people

1:13:30.940 --> 1:13:32.500
 as opposed to SARS1?

1:13:32.500 --> 1:13:37.500
 Well, the genome is 20% different from SARS1, say.

1:13:38.540 --> 1:13:40.300
 And in those bases, there's some,

1:13:40.300 --> 1:13:42.900
 there are things that make it different from SARS1.

1:13:42.900 --> 1:13:45.580
 It binds the same receptor, ACE2, on the cell surface.

1:13:45.580 --> 1:13:48.020
 So that's remarkable.

1:13:48.020 --> 1:13:50.100
 It has a lot of the same proteins.

1:13:50.100 --> 1:13:50.980
 They look similar.

1:13:50.980 --> 1:13:53.100
 Like if you look at the structure of the spikes,

1:13:53.100 --> 1:13:54.660
 they look similar,

1:13:54.660 --> 1:13:57.020
 but there's enough amino acid differences

1:13:57.020 --> 1:13:58.500
 to make the bio.

1:13:58.500 --> 1:14:00.060
 And what it is, we don't know,

1:14:00.060 --> 1:14:03.200
 because how do you figure that out?

1:14:03.200 --> 1:14:04.900
 You need to study animals,

1:14:04.900 --> 1:14:06.700
 because you can't infect people.

1:14:06.700 --> 1:14:08.940
 And the animal models aren't great.

1:14:10.220 --> 1:14:11.600
 So the way you figure that out

1:14:11.600 --> 1:14:14.980
 is you figure out how those differences,

1:14:14.980 --> 1:14:16.780
 what functional,

1:14:16.780 --> 1:14:18.540
 like how the difference in the amino acids

1:14:18.540 --> 1:14:20.860
 lead to functional difference of the virus.

1:14:20.860 --> 1:14:21.700
 That's right.

1:14:21.700 --> 1:14:23.180
 Like how it attaches, how it breaks the cell wall.

1:14:23.180 --> 1:14:24.020
 Exactly.

1:14:24.020 --> 1:14:25.700
 And how the hell do you figure that out?

1:14:25.700 --> 1:14:29.980
 Like, I guess there's models of interaction.

1:14:29.980 --> 1:14:33.180
 First, you need an animal of some kind to infect, right?

1:14:33.180 --> 1:14:34.920
 You can use mice.

1:14:34.920 --> 1:14:38.660
 People have used ferrets, guinea pigs,

1:14:38.660 --> 1:14:40.820
 nonhuman primates,

1:14:40.820 --> 1:14:41.780
 all of the above.

1:14:41.780 --> 1:14:43.260
 Nonhuman primates are very expensive,

1:14:43.260 --> 1:14:44.640
 so not many people do that.

1:14:45.740 --> 1:14:48.500
 And then you can put the virus in the respiratory tract.

1:14:48.500 --> 1:14:51.620
 But in fact, none of them get sick like people do.

1:14:52.720 --> 1:14:55.580
 Many people with COVID get a mild disease,

1:14:55.580 --> 1:14:59.620
 but 20% get a very severe, longer lasting disease.

1:14:59.620 --> 1:15:00.780
 They can die from it, right?

1:15:00.780 --> 1:15:03.020
 No animal does that yet.

1:15:03.020 --> 1:15:05.460
 So we have no insight into what's controlling that.

1:15:05.460 --> 1:15:07.500
 But if you just wanna look at the very first part

1:15:07.500 --> 1:15:10.880
 of infection and the shedding and the transmission,

1:15:10.880 --> 1:15:14.620
 you can do it in any one of several animal models.

1:15:14.620 --> 1:15:16.660
 Ferrets are really good for transmission.

1:15:16.660 --> 1:15:19.620
 They tend to have nasal structures like humans

1:15:19.620 --> 1:15:22.780
 and you can put them in cages next to each other

1:15:22.780 --> 1:15:24.900
 and they'll transmit the virus really nicely.

1:15:24.900 --> 1:15:26.620
 So you can study that.

1:15:26.620 --> 1:15:29.740
 But the other thing that's important that we should mention

1:15:29.740 --> 1:15:32.180
 is how do you manipulate these viruses?

1:15:34.100 --> 1:15:35.720
 So these are RNA viruses.

1:15:36.680 --> 1:15:38.740
 You can't manipulate RNA.

1:15:38.740 --> 1:15:40.820
 We don't know how to do it.

1:15:40.820 --> 1:15:45.740
 But DNA, because of the recombinant DNA revolution

1:15:45.740 --> 1:15:47.980
 that occurred in the 70s,

1:15:47.980 --> 1:15:51.460
 we can change DNA any way we want.

1:15:51.460 --> 1:15:53.680
 We can change a single base, we can cut out bases,

1:15:53.680 --> 1:15:56.960
 we can put other things in really easily.

1:15:56.960 --> 1:16:01.680
 And if I may give it a personal aspect,

1:16:01.680 --> 1:16:05.820
 when I went to MIT as a postdoc in 1979,

1:16:05.820 --> 1:16:09.020
 David Baltimore said, here's what I want you to do.

1:16:09.020 --> 1:16:12.580
 The moratorium on recombinant DNA experiments

1:16:12.580 --> 1:16:14.740
 on viruses has just been lifted.

1:16:14.740 --> 1:16:18.180
 I want you to make a DNA copy of polio

1:16:18.180 --> 1:16:19.820
 and see if you put that in a cell

1:16:19.820 --> 1:16:21.600
 whether it will start an infection.

1:16:21.600 --> 1:16:24.440
 It's okay.

1:16:24.440 --> 1:16:27.280
 So I made a DNA copy of polio virus.

1:16:27.280 --> 1:16:29.360
 It's only 7,500 bases.

1:16:29.360 --> 1:16:31.760
 It's much smaller than corona.

1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:35.560
 And I took that DNA and I put it in a piece of DNA

1:16:35.560 --> 1:16:37.960
 from a bacteria called a plasmid.

1:16:37.960 --> 1:16:41.440
 And you can grow plasmids in many, many bacteria,

1:16:41.440 --> 1:16:44.600
 make lots of them and purify the DNA really easily.

1:16:44.600 --> 1:16:48.680
 And I took that DNA and I sequenced it

1:16:48.680 --> 1:16:50.880
 because we didn't know the genome sequence

1:16:50.880 --> 1:16:52.680
 of polio at the time.

1:16:52.680 --> 1:16:54.640
 And that took me a year by the way,

1:16:54.640 --> 1:16:57.280
 because the techniques we had were really archaic

1:16:57.280 --> 1:17:00.000
 and nowadays you could do it in 15 minutes, right?

1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:01.520
 It's amazing.

1:17:01.520 --> 1:17:05.640
 And I took the DNA, I put it into cells and out came polio.

1:17:06.800 --> 1:17:07.980
 So that's the start.

1:17:07.980 --> 1:17:10.720
 Now, since then everybody has taken that technique

1:17:10.720 --> 1:17:11.720
 and used it for their virus.

1:17:11.720 --> 1:17:13.180
 You can now do it with SARS CoV2.

1:17:13.180 --> 1:17:16.000
 You make a DNA copy of any RNA virus,

1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:19.040
 you can modify it and you put it back into cells

1:17:19.040 --> 1:17:21.440
 and you'll get your modified virus out.

1:17:21.440 --> 1:17:23.780
 So that's an important part of understanding

1:17:23.780 --> 1:17:26.620
 the properties of the virus as, say, in an animal.

1:17:26.620 --> 1:17:28.840
 By changing the virus, you're changing a DNA copy,

1:17:28.840 --> 1:17:32.500
 you're making the virus then and putting it into the animal.

1:17:32.500 --> 1:17:35.360
 Can you clarify, so even in the RNA virus,

1:17:35.360 --> 1:17:38.040
 you can take and turn it into DNA?

1:17:38.040 --> 1:17:38.880
 Yes.

1:17:38.880 --> 1:17:41.000
 And then that allows you to modify it.

1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:41.840
 Yes.

1:17:41.840 --> 1:17:44.240
 What's that mapping?

1:17:44.240 --> 1:17:46.000
 Well, no, no, no, what's the process

1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:48.320
 of going from RNA to DNA?

1:17:48.320 --> 1:17:49.680
 Reverse transcription.

1:17:49.680 --> 1:17:50.680
 That's reverse transcription.

1:17:50.680 --> 1:17:51.520
 Right.

1:17:51.520 --> 1:17:53.120
 Oh, so you actually go through the process

1:17:53.120 --> 1:17:54.720
 of reverse transcription to do this?

1:17:54.720 --> 1:17:55.540
 Yes.

1:17:55.540 --> 1:17:58.400
 Remember, David Baltimore and Howard had discovered

1:17:58.400 --> 1:18:00.080
 this enzyme in the 70s.

1:18:00.080 --> 1:18:01.720
 They got the Nobel Prize for that.

1:18:01.720 --> 1:18:04.560
 And when I went to David's lab at MIT,

1:18:04.560 --> 1:18:06.360
 he had the enzyme in the freezer.

1:18:06.360 --> 1:18:08.760
 He said, here, take this and make a DNA copy of polio.

1:18:08.760 --> 1:18:10.160
 Yeah, I didn't make the connection

1:18:10.160 --> 1:18:14.000
 that you can use that kind of thing for an RNA virus.

1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:14.840
 And so that's.

1:18:14.840 --> 1:18:15.880
 And then modify it.

1:18:15.880 --> 1:18:18.200
 See, any DNA virus already exists as DNA.

1:18:18.200 --> 1:18:19.760
 So you can modify it.

1:18:19.760 --> 1:18:22.280
 But for RNA viruses, it was difficult.

1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:25.640
 And so then from that point on, for influenza,

1:18:25.640 --> 1:18:28.000
 every other RNA virus and coronaviruses,

1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:29.840
 people made DNA copies.

1:18:29.840 --> 1:18:31.520
 And that's what they use to modify

1:18:31.520 --> 1:18:34.600
 and ask questions about what things are doing, right?

1:18:34.600 --> 1:18:35.560
 What's this gene doing?

1:18:35.560 --> 1:18:36.400
 What if we take it out?

1:18:36.400 --> 1:18:37.220
 What happened?

1:18:37.220 --> 1:18:39.560
 Can you do the same thing with COVID?

1:18:39.560 --> 1:18:41.160
 Is take the RNA and then.

1:18:41.160 --> 1:18:42.000
 Of course.

1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:44.160
 And in fact, in January 2020,

1:18:44.160 --> 1:18:47.600
 as soon as the genome sequence was released from China,

1:18:47.600 --> 1:18:52.600
 the labs all over were synthesizing this 30,000 base DNA

1:18:52.760 --> 1:18:54.320
 and getting virus.

1:18:54.320 --> 1:18:58.280
 What can you figure out without infecting anything?

1:18:58.280 --> 1:19:01.720
 Just turning into, with the reverse transcription,

1:19:01.720 --> 1:19:03.560
 turning into DNA, modifying stuff,

1:19:03.560 --> 1:19:05.520
 and then putting it into a cell.

1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:08.360
 What can you figure out from that?

1:19:08.360 --> 1:19:11.640
 Oh, well, you could, let's say you can cut out a gene.

1:19:11.640 --> 1:19:13.280
 You see some genes in the sequence.

1:19:13.280 --> 1:19:14.720
 I don't know what these genes do.

1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:16.040
 Let's cut them out.

1:19:16.040 --> 1:19:18.840
 And then you could cut them out of the DNA.

1:19:18.840 --> 1:19:22.080
 You put the DNA in cells and maybe you get virus out.

1:19:22.080 --> 1:19:25.440
 And you go, oh, clearly that gene's not needed

1:19:25.440 --> 1:19:27.820
 for the virus to reproduce, at least in cells, right?

1:19:27.820 --> 1:19:29.200
 Or maybe you take the gene out

1:19:29.200 --> 1:19:31.600
 and you never get any virus, so it's lethal.

1:19:31.600 --> 1:19:33.520
 Is there a nice systematic ways of doing this?

1:19:33.520 --> 1:19:35.480
 Do people kind of automate it?

1:19:35.480 --> 1:19:36.320
 Absolutely.

1:19:36.320 --> 1:19:41.080
 And we, I mean, the problem with SARS, the COVID virus,

1:19:41.080 --> 1:19:44.460
 is it's 30,000 bases, a lot of stuff there.

1:19:44.460 --> 1:19:48.480
 And what makes it more difficult is that you have to,

1:19:48.480 --> 1:19:53.480
 it's been classified as a BSL3 agent, biosafety level three.

1:19:55.600 --> 1:19:58.960
 And so not everyone has a lab that's capable of doing that.

1:19:58.960 --> 1:20:02.760
 So it limits the number of people who can do experiments.

1:20:02.760 --> 1:20:05.720
 You know, we're lucky to have a few in New York City,

1:20:05.720 --> 1:20:07.520
 but not every place has them.

1:20:07.520 --> 1:20:11.520
 So you cannot work with a virus just out on the bench

1:20:11.520 --> 1:20:13.040
 like we do with many other viruses.

1:20:13.040 --> 1:20:15.800
 You have to wear a suit and have to have special procedures

1:20:15.800 --> 1:20:16.920
 and containment and so forth.

1:20:16.920 --> 1:20:19.240
 So it makes it difficult to do basic experiments

1:20:19.240 --> 1:20:20.080
 on the virus.

1:20:20.080 --> 1:20:22.800
 But when it's a pandemic, there's a lot of money,

1:20:22.800 --> 1:20:25.600
 there's a lot of incentive to work on it harder.

1:20:25.600 --> 1:20:27.360
 And also you don't need to work on the virus.

1:20:27.360 --> 1:20:29.280
 You can take bits of it and work.

1:20:29.280 --> 1:20:31.200
 You could take, say, just the spike, right?

1:20:31.200 --> 1:20:33.880
 And say, can we make a vaccine with just the spike?

1:20:33.880 --> 1:20:36.800
 Because that doesn't require BSL3, so yes.

1:20:36.800 --> 1:20:40.480
 So like building a vaccine requires you to figure out

1:20:40.480 --> 1:20:44.680
 how, or antiviral drugs, how to attack various structural

1:20:44.680 --> 1:20:47.040
 parts of the virus and the functional parts of the virus.

1:20:47.040 --> 1:20:47.880
 Right.

1:20:47.880 --> 1:20:50.040
 You have to decide on a target.

1:20:50.040 --> 1:20:50.880
 Yeah.

1:20:50.880 --> 1:20:52.360
 Like, I'm gonna make an antiviral,

1:20:52.360 --> 1:20:55.480
 what am I gonna target in the virus?

1:20:55.480 --> 1:21:00.440
 And there are a few things that make more sense than others.

1:21:00.440 --> 1:21:03.400
 Usually we like to target enzymes.

1:21:03.400 --> 1:21:05.560
 I don't know if you remember your biochemistry,

1:21:05.560 --> 1:21:07.840
 but enzymes are catalytic.

1:21:07.840 --> 1:21:10.480
 You don't need a lot of them to do a lot of things.

1:21:10.480 --> 1:21:12.880
 So they're typically in low concentrations

1:21:12.880 --> 1:21:14.360
 in a virus infected cell.

1:21:14.360 --> 1:21:17.120
 So it's easier to inhibit them with a drug.

1:21:17.120 --> 1:21:20.920
 And the coronas have a couple of enzymes that we can target.

1:21:20.920 --> 1:21:23.640
 So you have to figure that out ahead of time

1:21:23.640 --> 1:21:25.080
 and decide what to go after.

1:21:25.080 --> 1:21:27.320
 And then you can look for drugs that inhibit

1:21:27.320 --> 1:21:28.400
 what you're interested in.

1:21:28.400 --> 1:21:29.940
 It's not that hard to do.

1:21:31.200 --> 1:21:34.040
 There's just something beautiful about biology,

1:21:34.040 --> 1:21:36.080
 about the mechanisms of biology.

1:21:36.080 --> 1:21:40.040
 And I kind of regret falling in love

1:21:40.040 --> 1:21:41.840
 with computer science so much

1:21:41.840 --> 1:21:46.280
 that I left that biology textbook on the show

1:21:46.280 --> 1:21:47.360
 and left it behind.

1:21:47.360 --> 1:21:49.480
 But hopefully we'll return to it now

1:21:49.480 --> 1:21:51.920
 because I think one of the things you learn

1:21:51.920 --> 1:21:55.080
 even in computer science that studying biology

1:21:56.040 --> 1:21:58.440
 and certainly neurobiology,

1:22:00.080 --> 1:22:02.760
 you get inspired.

1:22:02.760 --> 1:22:05.160
 Here's a mechanism of incredible complexity

1:22:05.160 --> 1:22:07.520
 that works really well, is very robust,

1:22:07.520 --> 1:22:09.520
 is very effective, efficient.

1:22:09.520 --> 1:22:11.800
 It inspires you to come up with techniques

1:22:11.800 --> 1:22:13.760
 that you can engineer in the machine.

1:22:13.760 --> 1:22:15.760
 That's what drives a field forward

1:22:15.760 --> 1:22:20.760
 when people improvise and come up with new technologies

1:22:21.280 --> 1:22:22.720
 that really make a difference.

1:22:22.720 --> 1:22:25.240
 And we have a bunch of those now.

1:22:25.240 --> 1:22:28.440
 What's the difference between the coronavirus family

1:22:28.440 --> 1:22:33.200
 and the other popular family, influenza virus family?

1:22:33.200 --> 1:22:37.320
 I mean, if I were, because you mentioned

1:22:37.320 --> 1:22:38.480
 we should have done a lot more

1:22:38.480 --> 1:22:39.920
 in terms of vaccine development,

1:22:39.920 --> 1:22:42.320
 that kind of thing for coronaviruses.

1:22:42.320 --> 1:22:46.440
 But if I were back then, from my understanding,

1:22:46.440 --> 1:22:49.840
 the thing we should all be afraid of is influenza,

1:22:49.840 --> 1:22:53.840
 like some strong variants coming out from that family.

1:22:53.840 --> 1:22:57.880
 That seems like the one that will destroy human civilization

1:22:57.880 --> 1:23:00.240
 or hurt us really badly.

1:23:00.240 --> 1:23:02.520
 I don't know if you agree with this sense,

1:23:02.520 --> 1:23:06.520
 but maybe you can also just clarify

1:23:06.520 --> 1:23:09.560
 what to use as the difference between the families.

1:23:09.560 --> 1:23:11.000
 So it's an interesting difference.

1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:14.440
 They both have membranes, right?

1:23:14.440 --> 1:23:18.080
 So then they have spike proteins embedded in them.

1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:20.720
 And they're different spikes.

1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:24.240
 In fact, for influenza, there are two main ones.

1:23:24.240 --> 1:23:26.040
 They're called the HA and the NA.

1:23:27.200 --> 1:23:30.840
 But what's inside is RNA,

1:23:30.840 --> 1:23:33.560
 but it's very different RNA.

1:23:33.560 --> 1:23:35.640
 And here we have to explain that.

1:23:35.640 --> 1:23:40.600
 So viruses with RNA can have three different kinds of RNA.

1:23:42.080 --> 1:23:44.440
 They can have what we call plus RNA.

1:23:45.480 --> 1:23:48.160
 They can have minus RNA,

1:23:48.160 --> 1:23:49.800
 or they could have plus minus,

1:23:49.800 --> 1:23:54.480
 actually two strands hybridized together.

1:23:54.480 --> 1:23:58.440
 The plus RNA simply means that

1:23:58.440 --> 1:24:01.800
 if you put that plus RNA in a cell,

1:24:01.800 --> 1:24:03.640
 you know, your cell has ribosomes in it

1:24:03.640 --> 1:24:05.720
 that make the proteins that you need.

1:24:05.720 --> 1:24:08.560
 The ribosomes will immediately latch onto the plus RNA

1:24:08.560 --> 1:24:09.920
 and begin to make proteins.

1:24:11.280 --> 1:24:15.280
 A minus RNA is not the right strand to make proteins.

1:24:15.280 --> 1:24:17.160
 So it has to be copied first.

1:24:17.160 --> 1:24:19.560
 And then the plus minus is both together.

1:24:19.560 --> 1:24:22.520
 So the SARS coronaviruses,

1:24:22.520 --> 1:24:25.240
 all the coronaviruses have plus RNA.

1:24:25.240 --> 1:24:26.800
 So as soon as that RNA gets in the cell,

1:24:26.800 --> 1:24:28.440
 boom, it starts an infectious cycle.

1:24:28.440 --> 1:24:31.280
 Same thing with poliovirus, by the way, which I worked on.

1:24:31.280 --> 1:24:34.920
 Influenza viruses are negative stranded.

1:24:34.920 --> 1:24:37.800
 So they cannot be translated when they get in the cell.

1:24:37.800 --> 1:24:40.040
 So that's tough for the virus

1:24:40.040 --> 1:24:45.040
 because the cell actually cannot make plus RNA

1:24:45.720 --> 1:24:47.000
 from minus RNA.

1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:49.160
 It doesn't have the enzyme to do it.

1:24:49.160 --> 1:24:53.600
 So the virus has to carry it in inside the virus particle.

1:24:53.600 --> 1:24:55.600
 And then when the minus RNA is in the cell,

1:24:55.600 --> 1:24:59.440
 the virus enzyme makes plus RNAs and those get translated.

1:24:59.440 --> 1:25:00.320
 So it's a big difference.

1:25:00.320 --> 1:25:03.400
 And then in the influenza viruses,

1:25:03.400 --> 1:25:07.040
 not only is it minus RNA, but it's in pieces.

1:25:07.040 --> 1:25:09.460
 It's in eight pieces.

1:25:09.460 --> 1:25:10.880
 We call that segmented,

1:25:10.880 --> 1:25:14.880
 whereas the corona is in one long piece of RNA.

1:25:14.880 --> 1:25:17.880
 So they're like floating separately?

1:25:17.880 --> 1:25:19.580
 Yeah, so the genes are on separate pieces.

1:25:19.580 --> 1:25:21.800
 They're all packaged inside that virus particle

1:25:21.800 --> 1:25:23.760
 of influenza virus, but they're in pieces.

1:25:23.760 --> 1:25:25.480
 And why that's important

1:25:25.480 --> 1:25:29.320
 is because if two different influenza viruses

1:25:29.320 --> 1:25:31.520
 infect the same cell,

1:25:31.520 --> 1:25:33.760
 the pieces as they reproduce can mix

1:25:33.760 --> 1:25:38.200
 and out can come a virus with a new assortment of pieces.

1:25:38.200 --> 1:25:40.240
 And that allows influenza virus

1:25:40.240 --> 1:25:43.840
 to undergo extremely high frequency evolution.

1:25:43.840 --> 1:25:45.640
 That's why we get pandemics.

1:25:45.640 --> 1:25:47.040
 When we have a new flu pandemics

1:25:47.040 --> 1:25:49.960
 is because somewhere in some animal,

1:25:49.960 --> 1:25:51.880
 two viruses have reassorted

1:25:51.880 --> 1:25:54.400
 and made a new virus that we hadn't seen before.

1:25:54.400 --> 1:25:59.400
 So you're talking about kind of biological characteristics,

1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:03.640
 but what am I incorrect in my intuition

1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:05.680
 that are from the things I've heard

1:26:05.680 --> 1:26:09.880
 that the influenza family viruses is more dangerous?

1:26:09.880 --> 1:26:12.560
 Like what makes it more dangerous to humans?

1:26:14.880 --> 1:26:16.080
 Well, it depends on the,

1:26:16.080 --> 1:26:19.400
 there are many flavors or vintages of influenza virus.

1:26:19.400 --> 1:26:21.200
 Some are dangerous and some are not, right?

1:26:21.200 --> 1:26:22.560
 It depends on which one.

1:26:22.560 --> 1:26:26.360
 Some like the 1918 apparently was very lethal,

1:26:26.360 --> 1:26:28.280
 killed a lot of people.

1:26:28.280 --> 1:26:30.080
 But more contemporary viruses,

1:26:30.080 --> 1:26:35.080
 we had a pandemic in 2009 of influenza.

1:26:35.800 --> 1:26:39.280
 That wasn't such a lethal virus.

1:26:39.280 --> 1:26:40.640
 We don't know exactly why,

1:26:40.640 --> 1:26:42.280
 but it didn't kill that many people.

1:26:42.280 --> 1:26:43.760
 It transmitted pretty well.

1:26:43.760 --> 1:26:45.200
 Is that the bird flu one?

1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:47.600
 They're all deriving.

1:26:47.600 --> 1:26:49.720
 That one was called swine influenza.

1:26:49.720 --> 1:26:50.560
 Swine, that's right, swine, yeah.

1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:52.280
 It seemed to have started in a pig,

1:26:52.280 --> 1:26:57.040
 but it had bird, it had RNAs from bird influenza viruses.

1:26:57.040 --> 1:27:00.600
 These viruses are all reassortants of different viruses

1:27:00.600 --> 1:27:03.040
 from pigs and birds and humans.

1:27:04.920 --> 1:27:07.120
 But influenza can cause pneumonia

1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:09.960
 and can kill you as does SARS COVID too.

1:27:09.960 --> 1:27:11.520
 So it depends on the virus.

1:27:11.520 --> 1:27:13.640
 So there is another influenza virus

1:27:13.640 --> 1:27:14.960
 that's currently circulating.

1:27:14.960 --> 1:27:18.600
 So right now we have the 2009 pandemic virus

1:27:18.600 --> 1:27:20.040
 that's still around.

1:27:20.040 --> 1:27:23.840
 And then the 1968 pandemic virus,

1:27:23.840 --> 1:27:25.760
 which was the one before 2009,

1:27:25.760 --> 1:27:27.400
 that one is still around too.

1:27:27.400 --> 1:27:29.080
 And that's more lethal.

1:27:29.080 --> 1:27:30.360
 And depending on the season,

1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:33.800
 some seasons the 2009 virus predominates,

1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:36.200
 some seasons the 1968.

1:27:36.200 --> 1:27:38.800
 And when the 68 is around, you get more lethality.

1:27:38.800 --> 1:27:41.680
 So we're living with an influenza family.

1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:43.960
 We haven't exterminated them.

1:27:43.960 --> 1:27:46.280
 Right, we never will, never exterminate them.

1:27:46.280 --> 1:27:47.120
 Why?

1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:51.080
 Because every shorebird in the world is infected with them.

1:27:51.080 --> 1:27:54.760
 Gulls and terns and ducks and all sorts of things.

1:27:54.760 --> 1:27:59.440
 Why can't we develop strong vaccines that defend against?

1:27:59.440 --> 1:28:02.160
 Oh, we could do that, sure.

1:28:02.160 --> 1:28:04.880
 But that would not eliminate them from humans.

1:28:04.880 --> 1:28:06.760
 Even if you had the best vaccine,

1:28:06.760 --> 1:28:08.840
 you would never get rid of it in people

1:28:08.840 --> 1:28:12.080
 because there would always be someone who's not vaccinated

1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:14.400
 or in which the vaccine didn't work.

1:28:14.400 --> 1:28:16.600
 No vaccine is 100%.

1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:17.440
 So.

1:28:17.440 --> 1:28:18.680
 Well, you just contradicted yourself.

1:28:18.680 --> 1:28:21.080
 You said the perfect vaccine.

1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:21.920
 So.

1:28:21.920 --> 1:28:23.160
 Imperfect, imperfect.

1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:26.640
 But then you said, like, even if you had the perfect,

1:28:26.640 --> 1:28:28.960
 yeah, some people wouldn't get vaccinated.

1:28:28.960 --> 1:28:30.440
 But I understand what you mean.

1:28:30.440 --> 1:28:32.640
 But I actually was asking how difficult is it

1:28:32.640 --> 1:28:35.200
 to make vaccines like that for,

1:28:35.200 --> 1:28:36.920
 it seems like it's very difficult to do that

1:28:36.920 --> 1:28:38.840
 for the influenza virus.

1:28:38.840 --> 1:28:42.960
 So it's really easy to make an old school vaccine.

1:28:42.960 --> 1:28:47.480
 So the way the first influenza vaccines were made

1:28:47.480 --> 1:28:51.040
 was actually Jonas Salk worked on them in the 40s.

1:28:51.040 --> 1:28:53.240
 You just grow lots of virus

1:28:53.240 --> 1:28:55.920
 and you grow it in eggs, by the way, chicken eggs.

1:28:55.920 --> 1:28:56.920
 Nice.

1:28:56.920 --> 1:28:57.880
 Literally?

1:28:57.880 --> 1:28:58.720
 Wait, wait.

1:28:58.720 --> 1:28:59.760
 Yeah, chicken, embryonated.

1:28:59.760 --> 1:29:02.760
 So they get fertilized and there's a 10 or 12 day embryo

1:29:02.760 --> 1:29:04.880
 in it and you put virus in it, it grows up

1:29:04.880 --> 1:29:05.720
 and then you harvest it.

1:29:05.720 --> 1:29:08.440
 You get about 10 mls of fluid.

1:29:08.440 --> 1:29:09.560
 And then you take that,

1:29:09.560 --> 1:29:12.400
 you treat it with formaldehyde or formalin

1:29:12.400 --> 1:29:16.560
 and it inactivates the virus so it's no longer infectious.

1:29:16.560 --> 1:29:18.440
 And you just inject that into people.

1:29:18.440 --> 1:29:19.840
 And that was the first flu vaccine.

1:29:19.840 --> 1:29:22.160
 It was made for the US Army actually.

1:29:22.160 --> 1:29:24.200
 And then it got moved over to people.

1:29:24.200 --> 1:29:27.360
 We still use that old school tech today.

1:29:27.360 --> 1:29:30.640
 So you're taking, can you help me out here?

1:29:30.640 --> 1:29:34.440
 Okay, so this is a good time to talk about vaccines.

1:29:34.440 --> 1:29:36.960
 Okay, so you're talking about,

1:29:36.960 --> 1:29:39.160
 you're taking the actual virus,

1:29:39.160 --> 1:29:42.520
 you put it in an egg, you let it grow up.

1:29:42.520 --> 1:29:44.120
 It's very funny that you put it in an egg.

1:29:44.120 --> 1:29:46.720
 It's very poetic.

1:29:46.720 --> 1:29:51.720
 And then how do you make it not infection,

1:29:52.680 --> 1:29:53.920
 not effective or whatever?

1:29:53.920 --> 1:29:54.760
 Not infectious.

1:29:54.760 --> 1:29:56.640
 Not infectious, is that the right term here?

1:29:56.640 --> 1:29:57.480
 Yeah.

1:29:57.480 --> 1:29:58.920
 So how do you make it not infectious?

1:29:58.920 --> 1:30:02.000
 You can treat it with any number of chemicals

1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:05.400
 that'll disrupt the particle so it no longer infects.

1:30:05.400 --> 1:30:09.040
 So that step of disrupting the particle

1:30:09.040 --> 1:30:12.880
 is that very specific to a particular variant particle?

1:30:12.880 --> 1:30:14.840
 No, the same collection of chemicals

1:30:14.840 --> 1:30:16.240
 you can use for all kinds of,

1:30:16.240 --> 1:30:19.600
 and which have been used for SARS CoV2 vaccines also.

1:30:19.600 --> 1:30:20.440
 Same technology.

1:30:20.440 --> 1:30:23.600
 Okay, so what are, there's several things to ask.

1:30:23.600 --> 1:30:25.280
 So you called it old school in a way

1:30:25.280 --> 1:30:27.560
 that's slightly dismissive,

1:30:27.560 --> 1:30:29.960
 like people talk about Windows 98 or something.

1:30:29.960 --> 1:30:34.760
 So is there risks involved with it?

1:30:34.760 --> 1:30:37.320
 Or is it just difficult to produce large amounts?

1:30:37.320 --> 1:30:38.800
 No, it's only, it's,

1:30:38.800 --> 1:30:40.080
 it's very easy.

1:30:40.080 --> 1:30:41.600
 I mean, you could do it in cells and culture,

1:30:41.600 --> 1:30:43.000
 but eggs were convenient.

1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:46.240
 And in the 1940s, we didn't have cells and culture.

1:30:46.240 --> 1:30:47.240
 We didn't know how to do that.

1:30:47.240 --> 1:30:49.680
 So we had to use something else.

1:30:49.680 --> 1:30:52.280
 It's easy to do,

1:30:52.280 --> 1:30:56.920
 but the process of inactivating the virus with a chemical

1:30:56.920 --> 1:30:59.920
 makes it not the best vaccine you can make.

1:30:59.920 --> 1:31:02.440
 The flu vaccines that we have today,

1:31:02.440 --> 1:31:05.680
 which are mostly based on this inactivation,

1:31:05.680 --> 1:31:08.480
 is called inactivated virus vaccines.

1:31:08.480 --> 1:31:12.280
 Oh, so like the kind of thing

1:31:12.280 --> 1:31:14.920
 it presents to the immune system to train on

1:31:14.920 --> 1:31:19.520
 is not close to the actual virus.

1:31:19.520 --> 1:31:20.480
 Yes, that's what we think.

1:31:20.480 --> 1:31:22.360
 So that's why probably the flu vaccines

1:31:22.360 --> 1:31:24.880
 are just not very good, you know?

1:31:24.880 --> 1:31:29.000
 60% efficiency at the best, right?

1:31:29.000 --> 1:31:30.040
 Which is not really good.

1:31:30.040 --> 1:31:31.160
 What does it mean?

1:31:31.160 --> 1:31:33.920
 What is the measure of efficiency for a vaccine?

1:31:33.920 --> 1:31:37.440
 Well, it's how it does in the general population

1:31:37.440 --> 1:31:38.800
 at preventing influenza.

1:31:38.800 --> 1:31:40.760
 At preventing?

1:31:40.760 --> 1:31:41.880
 Illness, not infection.

1:31:41.880 --> 1:31:44.800
 We usually don't measure infection

1:31:44.800 --> 1:31:46.040
 when we're testing a vaccine.

1:31:46.040 --> 1:31:47.640
 We just measure sickness.

1:31:47.640 --> 1:31:50.200
 That's really easy to score, right?

1:31:50.200 --> 1:31:52.040
 You do a trial and you say,

1:31:52.040 --> 1:31:53.840
 if you feel sick, give us a call.

1:31:53.840 --> 1:31:55.280
 We'll tell you what to do.

1:31:55.280 --> 1:31:58.040
 So yeah, I mean, what's sickness?

1:31:58.040 --> 1:32:01.520
 Sickness is the presence of symptoms?

1:32:01.520 --> 1:32:04.920
 So this is good time to say what a symptom is, okay?

1:32:04.920 --> 1:32:08.880
 A symptom is what you only can feel.

1:32:08.880 --> 1:32:11.560
 Only you can feel an upset stomach

1:32:11.560 --> 1:32:13.320
 or a sore throat or that sort of thing.

1:32:13.320 --> 1:32:15.160
 It's the lived experience of a symptom.

1:32:15.160 --> 1:32:19.040
 Whereas a sign is something that someone could measure

1:32:19.040 --> 1:32:20.480
 and tell that you're infected,

1:32:20.480 --> 1:32:25.480
 like virus in your nasopharynx or something else, right?

1:32:26.040 --> 1:32:27.080
 Signs and symptoms.

1:32:27.080 --> 1:32:30.040
 And so in a vaccine trial, they tell you,

1:32:30.040 --> 1:32:31.800
 well, if you have any of these symptoms,

1:32:31.800 --> 1:32:35.040
 they give you a paper with the exact symptoms listed

1:32:35.040 --> 1:32:36.840
 to make sure you're picking them up, right?

1:32:36.840 --> 1:32:41.480
 So for flu, it would probably be fever, sore throat, cough.

1:32:41.480 --> 1:32:44.160
 You call them and then they will do a PCR,

1:32:44.160 --> 1:32:46.560
 make sure you've got flu and not some other virus

1:32:46.560 --> 1:32:48.160
 that makes similar symptoms.

1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:53.760
 And then they would say, are you a vaccine or non vaccine arm

1:32:53.760 --> 1:32:55.760
 and count up all the infections

1:32:55.760 --> 1:32:57.680
 and see how the vaccine did, basically.

1:32:57.680 --> 1:33:02.080
 That's so fascinating because the reporting,

1:33:02.080 --> 1:33:03.760
 so symptom is what you feel.

1:33:03.760 --> 1:33:04.600
 Yes, for sure.

1:33:04.600 --> 1:33:09.600
 And certainly the mind has a ability to conjure up feelings.

1:33:10.120 --> 1:33:11.800
 Oh yes, absolutely.

1:33:11.800 --> 1:33:16.080
 And so like culturally, maybe there was a time

1:33:16.080 --> 1:33:20.440
 in our culture where it was looked down upon

1:33:20.440 --> 1:33:23.480
 to feel sick or something like that,

1:33:23.480 --> 1:33:25.080
 like toughen up kind of thing.

1:33:25.080 --> 1:33:28.560
 And so then you probably have very few symptoms

1:33:28.560 --> 1:33:29.480
 being reported.

1:33:29.480 --> 1:33:30.960
 Absolutely, absolutely.

1:33:30.960 --> 1:33:34.840
 And now is like much more, I don't know,

1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:37.880
 perhaps you're much more likely to report symptoms.

1:33:37.880 --> 1:33:40.800
 Now it's fascinating because then it changes.

1:33:40.800 --> 1:33:43.280
 Oh, it is definitely a perception because for,

1:33:43.280 --> 1:33:46.080
 your symptom may be nothing to me or vice versa, right?

1:33:46.080 --> 1:33:47.480
 And so when you're doing this,

1:33:47.480 --> 1:33:52.080
 it's a little bit of a imprecise science because,

1:33:52.080 --> 1:33:56.160
 and even it's a cultural thing in some countries,

1:33:56.160 --> 1:33:57.800
 something that would make us feel horrible,

1:33:57.800 --> 1:33:59.200
 they wouldn't even bother reporting.

1:33:59.200 --> 1:34:00.440
 No, I didn't have any symptoms.

1:34:00.440 --> 1:34:03.400
 So it's a little bit imprecise and it clouds the results.

1:34:03.400 --> 1:34:05.800
 So if you can measure things, it's always better,

1:34:05.800 --> 1:34:07.720
 but you start out with a symptom.

1:34:07.720 --> 1:34:11.120
 And if you say, if someone tells you this virus,

1:34:11.120 --> 1:34:15.720
 20% of the people are asymptomatic,

1:34:15.720 --> 1:34:18.200
 they don't report symptoms,

1:34:19.400 --> 1:34:21.960
 that number is probably not a constant.

1:34:21.960 --> 1:34:24.200
 It depends where you did the study.

1:34:24.200 --> 1:34:26.880
 It could be different in China versus South America,

1:34:26.880 --> 1:34:28.400
 Europe, et cetera, yeah.

1:34:28.400 --> 1:34:29.560
 I mean, I was trying to figure,

1:34:29.560 --> 1:34:32.400
 so I took two shots of the Pfizer vaccine

1:34:32.400 --> 1:34:34.560
 and I had zero symptoms.

1:34:34.560 --> 1:34:35.400
 Wow.

1:34:35.400 --> 1:34:37.160
 So, and I was wondering, well, see,

1:34:37.160 --> 1:34:38.760
 but that's my feelings, right?

1:34:38.760 --> 1:34:42.040
 This is not, because I felt fine, I was waiting.

1:34:42.040 --> 1:34:44.040
 Did you have pain at the injection site?

1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:48.360
 No, it was kind of pleasant.

1:34:48.360 --> 1:34:50.280
 You felt nothing the next day, no?

1:34:50.280 --> 1:34:53.360
 Nothing, no tiredness, no exhaustion, no.

1:34:54.520 --> 1:34:56.720
 But see, like I have an insane sleeping schedule.

1:34:56.720 --> 1:34:59.280
 I already put myself through crazy stuff.

1:34:59.280 --> 1:35:03.280
 That said, maybe I was expecting something really bad.

1:35:03.280 --> 1:35:06.760
 Like I was waiting and therefore didn't feel it.

1:35:06.760 --> 1:35:10.200
 But I also got allergy shots

1:35:11.120 --> 1:35:14.600
 and those, I was out all next day,

1:35:14.600 --> 1:35:16.400
 like exhausted for some reason.

1:35:16.400 --> 1:35:20.600
 So that gave me like a sense like, okay,

1:35:20.600 --> 1:35:22.640
 at least sometimes I can feel shitty.

1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:24.440
 That's good to know.

1:35:24.440 --> 1:35:25.280
 Sure, sure.

1:35:25.280 --> 1:35:27.160
 And then with the vaccine it didn't,

1:35:27.160 --> 1:35:29.000
 but the question is like,

1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:32.560
 how much does my mind come into play there?

1:35:32.560 --> 1:35:34.920
 The expectations of symptoms,

1:35:35.920 --> 1:35:39.280
 the expectations of not feeling well,

1:35:39.280 --> 1:35:41.280
 how does that affect the sort of the self reporting

1:35:41.280 --> 1:35:42.120
 of the symptoms?

1:35:42.120 --> 1:35:44.560
 I think it's definitely a variable there,

1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:47.560
 but there's certainly many people that don't feel anything

1:35:47.560 --> 1:35:48.440
 after the vaccines.

1:35:48.440 --> 1:35:51.980
 And there's some that have a whole range of things

1:35:51.980 --> 1:35:54.920
 like soreness and fever, et cetera, yeah.

1:35:54.920 --> 1:35:57.040
 So okay, you were talking about the old school development

1:35:57.040 --> 1:35:58.560
 inside the egg.

1:35:58.560 --> 1:35:59.400
 Right.

1:35:59.400 --> 1:36:02.000
 What's better than that?

1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:04.420
 So then the next generation of vaccines

1:36:04.420 --> 1:36:07.840
 which arose in the 50s were what we call

1:36:07.840 --> 1:36:11.440
 replication competent, where the virus you take

1:36:11.440 --> 1:36:13.920
 and it's actually reproducing in you.

1:36:13.920 --> 1:36:16.040
 Yeah, that sounds safe.

1:36:16.040 --> 1:36:19.040
 And it can be somewhat problematic, yes,

1:36:19.040 --> 1:36:20.080
 as you might imagine,

1:36:20.080 --> 1:36:22.320
 because once you put that virus in you,

1:36:22.320 --> 1:36:24.120
 you have no more control, right?

1:36:24.120 --> 1:36:25.720
 It's not like you have a kill switch in it,

1:36:25.720 --> 1:36:28.620
 which actually would be a great idea to put in.

1:36:29.960 --> 1:36:32.200
 Like nanobots, what can possibly go wrong?

1:36:32.200 --> 1:36:34.200
 No, you could just put something in there.

1:36:34.200 --> 1:36:37.880
 If you added a drug, you would shut it off, right?

1:36:37.880 --> 1:36:39.880
 And people are thinking about that

1:36:39.880 --> 1:36:43.560
 because now we're engineering viruses to treat cancers

1:36:43.560 --> 1:36:46.680
 and other diseases and we may wanna put kill switches

1:36:46.680 --> 1:36:48.560
 in them just to make sure they don't run away.

1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:50.360
 Oh, interesting, so you can deploy a drug

1:36:50.360 --> 1:36:54.960
 that binds to this virus that would shut it off

1:36:54.960 --> 1:36:56.480
 in the body, something like that.

1:36:56.480 --> 1:36:58.620
 Something like that, yeah, that would be the idea.

1:36:58.620 --> 1:36:59.880
 You'd have to engineer it in.

1:36:59.880 --> 1:37:03.580
 Anyway, these were, the first one was yellow fever vaccine

1:37:03.580 --> 1:37:06.220
 that was made because that was a big problem.

1:37:06.220 --> 1:37:09.640
 And this virus, and the way you do this,

1:37:09.640 --> 1:37:12.640
 back in the old day was empirical.

1:37:12.640 --> 1:37:15.280
 So Max Tyler, who did the yellow fever vaccine,

1:37:15.280 --> 1:37:18.580
 he took the virus, which is a human virus, right?

1:37:19.640 --> 1:37:23.780
 And he infected, I think he used chick embryos.

1:37:24.980 --> 1:37:27.340
 And he went from one embryo to another and just kept passing

1:37:27.340 --> 1:37:29.320
 and he did that hundreds of times.

1:37:29.320 --> 1:37:32.680
 And every 10 passages, he would take the virus

1:37:32.680 --> 1:37:36.560
 and put it in a mouse or a monkey, whatever his model was.

1:37:36.560 --> 1:37:38.040
 And then eventually he got a virus

1:37:38.040 --> 1:37:41.880
 that didn't cause any disease after 200 and some passages.

1:37:41.880 --> 1:37:43.840
 And then that was tested in people

1:37:43.840 --> 1:37:46.800
 and it became the yellow fever vaccine that we use today.

1:37:46.800 --> 1:37:50.420
 He selected for mutations that made the virus

1:37:50.420 --> 1:37:55.420
 not cause disease, but still make an immune response.

1:37:55.420 --> 1:37:57.620
 So those are called replication competent.

1:37:57.620 --> 1:37:59.480
 We now have the polio vaccine,

1:37:59.480 --> 1:38:03.160
 which was developed in the 50s after the yellow fever.

1:38:03.160 --> 1:38:05.440
 Then we had measles, mumps, rubella.

1:38:05.440 --> 1:38:09.160
 Those are all replication competent vaccines.

1:38:09.160 --> 1:38:12.400
 And you mentioned is that's a good idea.

1:38:12.400 --> 1:38:15.460
 They are all safe vaccines.

1:38:15.460 --> 1:38:18.440
 The only one that has had an issue

1:38:18.440 --> 1:38:21.360
 is the polio replication competent vaccine.

1:38:21.360 --> 1:38:25.960
 It was called Sabin vaccine or oral polio virus vaccine

1:38:25.960 --> 1:38:29.720
 because you take it orally, it's wonderful

1:38:29.720 --> 1:38:31.420
 because you don't have to inject it.

1:38:31.420 --> 1:38:33.280
 This is the perfect delivery.

1:38:34.280 --> 1:38:37.000
 Either intranasal for a respiratory virus

1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:39.040
 or orally for polio goes into your intestines.

1:38:39.040 --> 1:38:42.920
 It reproduces and it gives you wonderful protection

1:38:42.920 --> 1:38:43.880
 against polio.

1:38:45.280 --> 1:38:47.960
 However, you do shed virus out

1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:52.760
 and that virus is no longer a vaccine.

1:38:52.760 --> 1:38:55.600
 It's reverted genetically in your intestine.

1:38:55.600 --> 1:38:57.440
 So you can infect others with polio.

1:38:57.440 --> 1:39:00.500
 Take that virus and put it into an animal and give it polio.

1:39:00.500 --> 1:39:05.500
 And in fact, the parents of some kids in the 60s and 70s

1:39:05.720 --> 1:39:08.340
 who were immunized got polio from the vaccine.

1:39:08.340 --> 1:39:11.240
 The rate was about one and one and a half million

1:39:12.400 --> 1:39:13.760
 cases of polio.

1:39:13.760 --> 1:39:15.360
 So it's called vaccine associated polio.

1:39:15.360 --> 1:39:17.040
 And I always argue that

1:39:18.040 --> 1:39:21.180
 we may not have picked the right vaccine.

1:39:21.180 --> 1:39:25.440
 There was a big fight in the US and other countries

1:39:25.440 --> 1:39:27.560
 between the inactivated polio

1:39:27.560 --> 1:39:29.800
 and the infectious polio vaccines,

1:39:29.800 --> 1:39:31.560
 which ones we should be using

1:39:31.560 --> 1:39:33.980
 because we found out that the infectious vaccine

1:39:33.980 --> 1:39:35.280
 actually caused polio.

1:39:35.280 --> 1:39:38.040
 And eight to 10 kids a year in the US alone

1:39:38.040 --> 1:39:39.800
 got polio from the vaccine,

1:39:39.800 --> 1:39:43.520
 which looking back is really not acceptable in my view,

1:39:43.520 --> 1:39:46.060
 although the public health community said it was

1:39:46.060 --> 1:39:47.560
 to get rid of polio.

1:39:47.560 --> 1:39:51.420
 So now we're close to eradicating polio globally,

1:39:53.120 --> 1:39:55.960
 but this vaccine derived polio is a problem.

1:39:55.960 --> 1:39:59.200
 So now we have to go back to the inactivated vaccine,

1:39:59.200 --> 1:40:01.440
 which is tough because it's injected.

1:40:01.440 --> 1:40:05.000
 So, okay, so the basic high level,

1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:08.360
 how vaccines work principle is

1:40:09.360 --> 1:40:11.200
 you want to deploy something in the body

1:40:11.200 --> 1:40:13.880
 that's as close to the actual virus as possible,

1:40:13.880 --> 1:40:15.880
 but doesn't do nearly as much harm.

1:40:15.880 --> 1:40:17.840
 And there's like a million, not a million,

1:40:17.840 --> 1:40:19.640
 but there's a bunch of ways you could possibly do that.

1:40:19.640 --> 1:40:20.600
 So those are two ways.

1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:22.020
 And now of course we have modern ways

1:40:22.020 --> 1:40:25.680
 we can make mRNA vaccines, right?

1:40:25.680 --> 1:40:26.800
 What are the modern ways?

1:40:26.800 --> 1:40:29.160
 I did, you wanna look, mRNA vaccine.

1:40:29.160 --> 1:40:31.140
 So that's one of the, that's the most modern,

1:40:31.140 --> 1:40:33.160
 but even before mRNA vaccines,

1:40:33.160 --> 1:40:36.080
 we learned that we could use viruses

1:40:36.080 --> 1:40:41.080
 to deliver proteins from a virus that you wanna prevent.

1:40:41.640 --> 1:40:43.960
 And so the Ebola vaccine,

1:40:43.960 --> 1:40:46.560
 we took the spike gene of Ebola virus

1:40:46.560 --> 1:40:47.980
 and put it in a different virus

1:40:47.980 --> 1:40:49.560
 and we deliver that to people

1:40:49.560 --> 1:40:52.000
 and that's called a vector vaccine.

1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:54.560
 And some of the COVID vaccines are vectors

1:40:54.560 --> 1:40:57.680
 of different kinds of most famous are adenovirus vectors

1:40:57.680 --> 1:41:00.440
 carrying the spike gene into the cell.

1:41:00.440 --> 1:41:03.320
 Can you explain how the vector vaccine works again?

1:41:03.320 --> 1:41:08.320
 So we have, we take a virus that will infect humans

1:41:09.160 --> 1:41:11.480
 but will not make you sick.

1:41:11.480 --> 1:41:13.480
 In the case of adenovirus,

1:41:13.480 --> 1:41:16.000
 the years and years of people studying it

1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:18.720
 has told us what genes you could cut out

1:41:18.720 --> 1:41:20.960
 and allow the virus to infect the cell

1:41:20.960 --> 1:41:22.120
 but not cause any disease.

1:41:22.120 --> 1:41:24.480
 So instead of doing selection on it,

1:41:24.480 --> 1:41:27.400
 you actually genetically modify it.

1:41:27.400 --> 1:41:29.160
 Yes, you modify the vector, yeah.

1:41:29.160 --> 1:41:30.640
 So you're much more precise about it.

1:41:30.640 --> 1:41:31.480
 You're very precise

1:41:31.480 --> 1:41:33.960
 and then you splice in the gene for the spike

1:41:34.880 --> 1:41:37.640
 and then you use that to deliver the gene

1:41:37.640 --> 1:41:39.680
 and it becomes produced as protein

1:41:39.680 --> 1:41:40.920
 and then you make an immune response.

1:41:40.920 --> 1:41:43.200
 And vector is the term for this modified.

1:41:43.200 --> 1:41:47.880
 Right, so we're now using viruses at our bidding.

1:41:47.880 --> 1:41:50.180
 We're using them as vectors, not just for vaccines.

1:41:50.180 --> 1:41:52.380
 We can cure monogenic diseases.

1:41:52.380 --> 1:41:55.560
 That is if you have, if you're born with a genetic disease,

1:41:55.560 --> 1:41:57.840
 you have a deletion or a mutation in a gene,

1:41:57.840 --> 1:42:01.960
 single gene, we can give you the regular gene back

1:42:01.960 --> 1:42:03.720
 using a virus vector.

1:42:03.720 --> 1:42:07.180
 So cancers too, we can cure cancers with vectors.

1:42:07.180 --> 1:42:09.920
 Wow, really?

1:42:09.920 --> 1:42:10.880
 Interesting. Yeah.

1:42:10.880 --> 1:42:12.540
 I think in 10 to 15 years,

1:42:12.540 --> 1:42:15.920
 most cancers will be treatable with viruses, yeah.

1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:16.760
 Wow.

1:42:16.760 --> 1:42:19.640
 And not only can we put things in the vector

1:42:19.640 --> 1:42:21.080
 to kill the tumor,

1:42:21.080 --> 1:42:25.360
 we can target the vector to the tumor specifically

1:42:25.360 --> 1:42:26.840
 in a number of ways.

1:42:26.840 --> 1:42:28.200
 And that makes it less toxic, right?

1:42:28.200 --> 1:42:30.200
 It doesn't infect all your other cells.

1:42:31.100 --> 1:42:34.800
 But it takes time to develop a vector for a particular thing

1:42:34.800 --> 1:42:37.560
 because it requires a deep understanding.

1:42:37.560 --> 1:42:40.880
 Yeah, in fact, we have about a dozen different virus vectors

1:42:40.880 --> 1:42:42.900
 that have been studied for 20 years.

1:42:42.900 --> 1:42:46.320
 And those are the set of vaccine vectors that we're using.

1:42:46.320 --> 1:42:50.760
 So it includes adenovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus,

1:42:50.760 --> 1:42:54.200
 which is a cousin of rabies, but doesn't make people sick.

1:42:54.200 --> 1:42:57.600
 Influenza virus is being used as a vector

1:42:57.600 --> 1:43:00.200
 and even measles virus.

1:43:00.200 --> 1:43:04.080
 So we're familiar with how to modify those to be vectors

1:43:04.080 --> 1:43:07.400
 and those are being used for COVID vaccines.

1:43:07.400 --> 1:43:10.560
 And then of course we have the newest,

1:43:10.560 --> 1:43:12.540
 which is the nucleic acid vaccines.

1:43:12.540 --> 1:43:15.220
 So years ago, people said,

1:43:15.220 --> 1:43:17.680
 why can't we just inject DNA into people?

1:43:18.960 --> 1:43:22.320
 Take the spike and put it in a DNA and inject it.

1:43:22.320 --> 1:43:25.240
 So people tried many, many different vaccines.

1:43:25.240 --> 1:43:28.240
 And in fact, there are no human licensed vaccines

1:43:28.240 --> 1:43:29.440
 that are DNA vaccines.

1:43:29.440 --> 1:43:33.040
 Although there is a West Nile vaccine for horses

1:43:33.040 --> 1:43:35.880
 that's a DNA based vaccine.

1:43:35.880 --> 1:43:38.120
 So if you have a horse, you can give it this vaccine,

1:43:38.120 --> 1:43:38.960
 but no human.

1:43:38.960 --> 1:43:42.560
 Can you clarify, does a DNA vaccine

1:43:42.560 --> 1:43:44.860
 only work for DNA viruses?

1:43:44.860 --> 1:43:46.800
 No, it can work for DNA or RNA.

1:43:46.800 --> 1:43:48.360
 Because remember, for an RNA virus,

1:43:48.360 --> 1:43:50.700
 we can make a DNA copy of it.

1:43:50.700 --> 1:43:53.760
 And it will still, when you put that DNA in a cell,

1:43:53.760 --> 1:43:55.440
 it goes into the nucleus.

1:43:55.440 --> 1:43:56.680
 Okay, right.

1:43:56.680 --> 1:43:58.440
 So it's, you're just skipping a step.

1:43:58.440 --> 1:43:59.280
 You get proteins.

1:43:59.280 --> 1:44:02.080
 For RNA vaccines, you're giving, okay, I got it.

1:44:02.080 --> 1:44:04.260
 So those didn't work for human vaccines.

1:44:04.260 --> 1:44:07.280
 And there were many HIV AIDS vaccine trials

1:44:07.280 --> 1:44:10.820
 that used DNA vaccines, didn't work.

1:44:10.820 --> 1:44:13.320
 And then a number of years ago,

1:44:13.320 --> 1:44:17.800
 people started thinking, how about RNA, RNA vaccines?

1:44:17.800 --> 1:44:20.280
 And I first heard this, I thought, what?

1:44:20.280 --> 1:44:22.320
 I've worked with RNA my whole career.

1:44:22.320 --> 1:44:24.280
 It's so fragile.

1:44:24.280 --> 1:44:26.660
 If you look at it the wrong way, it breaks.

1:44:27.600 --> 1:44:29.780
 I mean, that's being facetious, right?

1:44:29.780 --> 1:44:31.600
 But you have to be very careful

1:44:31.600 --> 1:44:34.540
 because your hands are full of enzymes

1:44:34.540 --> 1:44:35.880
 that will degrade RNA.

1:44:37.360 --> 1:44:38.860
 So I thought, how could this possibly work,

1:44:38.860 --> 1:44:40.160
 injecting it into someone's?

1:44:40.160 --> 1:44:43.920
 It's an example of I was skeptical and I was wrong.

1:44:43.920 --> 1:44:47.160
 It turns out that if you modify the RNA properly

1:44:47.160 --> 1:44:50.400
 and protect it in a lipid capsule,

1:44:50.400 --> 1:44:52.920
 it actually works as a vaccine.

1:44:52.920 --> 1:44:54.920
 And people were working on this years

1:44:54.920 --> 1:44:57.060
 before COVID came around.

1:44:57.060 --> 1:45:00.280
 They were doing experimental mRNA vaccines

1:45:00.280 --> 1:45:01.480
 and there were a couple of companies

1:45:01.480 --> 1:45:02.500
 that were working on it.

1:45:02.500 --> 1:45:07.440
 And so at the beginning of 2020, they said, let's try it.

1:45:07.440 --> 1:45:09.680
 And I was skeptical, frankly,

1:45:09.680 --> 1:45:12.120
 because I just thought RNA would be too labile,

1:45:12.120 --> 1:45:13.600
 but I was wrong.

1:45:13.600 --> 1:45:17.600
 So this is, as we're saying offline, one of the great things

1:45:17.600 --> 1:45:20.600
 about you is you're able to say when you're wrong

1:45:20.600 --> 1:45:22.320
 about intuitions you've had in the past,

1:45:22.320 --> 1:45:25.140
 which is a beautiful thing for a scientist.

1:45:25.140 --> 1:45:28.120
 But I still think it's very surprising

1:45:28.120 --> 1:45:30.120
 that something like that works, right?

1:45:30.120 --> 1:45:31.400
 Yeah, I am surprised.

1:45:31.400 --> 1:45:36.200
 So you're just launching RNA in a protective membrane.

1:45:36.200 --> 1:45:39.800
 And then now one thing is surprising

1:45:39.800 --> 1:45:44.800
 that the RNA sort of lasts long enough in its structure.

1:45:45.720 --> 1:45:50.440
 But then the other thing is why does it work

1:45:50.440 --> 1:45:55.440
 that that's a good training ground for the immune system?

1:45:56.760 --> 1:45:59.800
 Is that obvious that that should work?

1:45:59.800 --> 1:46:01.260
 I don't think it's obvious to most people

1:46:01.260 --> 1:46:03.040
 and it's worth going into it

1:46:03.040 --> 1:46:04.560
 because it's really interesting.

1:46:04.560 --> 1:46:09.040
 I mean, first of all, they wrap the RNA in fats,

1:46:09.040 --> 1:46:10.560
 in lipid membranes, right?

1:46:10.560 --> 1:46:14.160
 And the particular formulation they test for years

1:46:14.160 --> 1:46:16.040
 to make sure it's stable,

1:46:16.040 --> 1:46:17.960
 it lasts a long time after it's injected.

1:46:17.960 --> 1:46:22.120
 And the two companies that make the current COVID vaccines,

1:46:22.120 --> 1:46:23.240
 right, Moderna and Pfizer,

1:46:23.240 --> 1:46:26.660
 they have different lipid formulations to get to the same.

1:46:26.660 --> 1:46:29.040
 So that's a real part of it.

1:46:29.040 --> 1:46:30.220
 And it's not simple.

1:46:30.220 --> 1:46:31.880
 There are quite a few different lipids

1:46:31.880 --> 1:46:34.080
 that they put into this coding.

1:46:34.080 --> 1:46:37.040
 And they test to see how long they protect the RNA

1:46:37.040 --> 1:46:39.160
 after it's injected, say, into a mouse,

1:46:39.160 --> 1:46:40.620
 how long does it last?

1:46:40.620 --> 1:46:43.320
 And the way it works is these,

1:46:43.320 --> 1:46:46.160
 apparently these lipid nanoparticles,

1:46:46.160 --> 1:46:48.800
 they get injected into your muscle,

1:46:48.800 --> 1:46:52.120
 they bump into cells and they get taken up.

1:46:52.120 --> 1:46:55.260
 So lipid fat is sticky.

1:46:56.960 --> 1:46:59.880
 It's greasy, we like to say.

1:46:59.880 --> 1:47:03.680
 And so your cells are covered with a greasy membrane also.

1:47:03.680 --> 1:47:06.560
 So when these lipid nanoparticles bump into them,

1:47:06.560 --> 1:47:08.360
 they stick and they eventually get taken up.

1:47:08.360 --> 1:47:11.240
 And they figured this out right at the beginning.

1:47:11.240 --> 1:47:13.720
 If we put RNA in a lipid nanoparticle,

1:47:13.720 --> 1:47:15.240
 will it get taken up into a cell?

1:47:15.240 --> 1:47:17.960
 And the answer was yes, it was just let's try it.

1:47:17.960 --> 1:47:18.800
 And it worked.

1:47:18.800 --> 1:47:20.340
 So it's basically experiment.

1:47:20.340 --> 1:47:22.640
 It's not like some deep understanding of biology.

1:47:22.640 --> 1:47:25.480
 It's experimentally speaking, it just seems to work.

1:47:25.480 --> 1:47:26.800
 Yeah, well, they had some idea

1:47:26.800 --> 1:47:30.440
 that lipids would target this to a cell membrane.

1:47:30.440 --> 1:47:33.880
 And remember, there's no receptor involved.

1:47:33.880 --> 1:47:36.900
 Like the virus has a specific protein

1:47:36.900 --> 1:47:39.240
 that attaches to a receptor.

1:47:39.240 --> 1:47:41.640
 It's not efficient enough to just bump around

1:47:41.640 --> 1:47:43.240
 and get into a cell.

1:47:43.240 --> 1:47:44.920
 That's what these things are doing.

1:47:44.920 --> 1:47:47.240
 And they probably optimize the lipids

1:47:47.240 --> 1:47:49.780
 to get more efficient uptake.

1:47:49.780 --> 1:47:51.920
 But it's not as efficient as a virus would be

1:47:51.920 --> 1:47:52.760
 to get into a cell.

1:47:52.760 --> 1:47:54.480
 Right, so you have no specific,

1:47:54.480 --> 1:47:57.600
 I mean, which is why it's surprising

1:47:57.600 --> 1:48:02.600
 that you can crack into the safe with a hammer.

1:48:02.600 --> 1:48:06.080
 Or with some fat.

1:48:06.080 --> 1:48:08.840
 I mean, that's kind of surprising.

1:48:08.840 --> 1:48:11.920
 It's kind of amazing that it works.

1:48:11.920 --> 1:48:16.920
 But so maybe let's try to talk about this.

1:48:17.360 --> 1:48:21.160
 So one of the hesitancies around vaccines

1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:24.680
 or basically around any new technology

1:48:24.680 --> 1:48:27.700
 is the fact that mRNA is a new idea.

1:48:28.600 --> 1:48:32.200
 And it's an idea that was shrouded in some skepticism,

1:48:32.200 --> 1:48:35.320
 as you said, by the scientific community.

1:48:35.320 --> 1:48:39.380
 Because it's a cool new technology.

1:48:40.240 --> 1:48:42.560
 Surprising that it works.

1:48:42.560 --> 1:48:44.400
 What's your intuition?

1:48:44.400 --> 1:48:46.400
 I think one nice way to approach this

1:48:46.400 --> 1:48:51.400
 is try to play devil's advocate and say both sides.

1:48:53.040 --> 1:48:56.160
 One side is why your intuition says

1:48:56.160 --> 1:48:59.080
 that it's safe for humans.

1:48:59.080 --> 1:49:03.520
 And what arguments can you see if you could steal man

1:49:03.520 --> 1:49:06.680
 and argument why it's unsafe for humans.

1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:09.340
 Or not unsafe for humans,

1:49:09.340 --> 1:49:14.340
 but the hesitancy to take an mRNA vaccine is justified.

1:49:15.160 --> 1:49:19.520
 So many people are afraid because it's new technology

1:49:19.520 --> 1:49:22.280
 and they feel it hasn't been tested.

1:49:22.280 --> 1:49:25.160
 I mean, in theory, what could go wrong?

1:49:25.160 --> 1:49:29.040
 This is the nice thing about mRNA

1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:30.840
 is that it doesn't last forever.

1:49:32.300 --> 1:49:35.020
 As opposed to DNA, which doesn't last forever,

1:49:35.020 --> 1:49:37.160
 but it can last a lot longer.

1:49:38.180 --> 1:49:40.560
 And it could even go into your DNA, right?

1:49:41.680 --> 1:49:44.340
 So mRNA has a shorter lifetime,

1:49:44.340 --> 1:49:47.300
 maybe days after it's injected into your arm,

1:49:47.300 --> 1:49:48.720
 then it's gone.

1:49:48.720 --> 1:49:49.740
 So that's a good thing

1:49:49.740 --> 1:49:52.040
 because it's not gonna be around forever.

1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:56.640
 So that would say, okay, so it's sticking around

1:49:56.640 --> 1:49:58.300
 for your lifetime is not happening.

1:49:58.300 --> 1:50:00.000
 But what else could happen?

1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:03.100
 Well, let's see the protein that's made,

1:50:03.100 --> 1:50:05.240
 could that be an issue?

1:50:05.240 --> 1:50:08.980
 And again, proteins don't last forever.

1:50:08.980 --> 1:50:12.500
 They have a finite longevity in the body.

1:50:12.500 --> 1:50:17.440
 And this one also lasts perhaps at the best a few weeks.

1:50:17.440 --> 1:50:18.880
 Now this is a protein that's made

1:50:18.880 --> 1:50:22.060
 after the RNA gets into the cell.

1:50:22.060 --> 1:50:25.060
 Yeah, so the lipid nanoparticles taken up into a cell

1:50:25.060 --> 1:50:27.860
 and the mRNA is translated and you get protein made.

1:50:27.860 --> 1:50:30.280
 And there's also a question, I'm sorry to interrupt,

1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:35.100
 where in the body, so because it's not well targeted,

1:50:35.100 --> 1:50:38.320
 or I don't know if it's supposed to be targeted,

1:50:38.320 --> 1:50:39.920
 but it can go throughout the body,

1:50:39.920 --> 1:50:40.760
 that's one of the concerns.

1:50:40.760 --> 1:50:43.660
 Right, so it's injected deep into your deltoid muscle,

1:50:43.660 --> 1:50:45.140
 right here, shoulder.

1:50:46.100 --> 1:50:49.780
 And the idea is not to put it in a blood vessel,

1:50:49.780 --> 1:50:52.400
 otherwise it would then for sure circulate everywhere.

1:50:52.400 --> 1:50:57.200
 So they go deep in a blood vessel and it's locally injected.

1:50:57.200 --> 1:51:00.380
 And they did, before this even went into people,

1:51:00.380 --> 1:51:01.820
 they did experiments in mice

1:51:01.820 --> 1:51:05.060
 where they gave them a thousand times higher concentrations

1:51:05.060 --> 1:51:06.860
 than they would ever give to people.

1:51:06.860 --> 1:51:09.340
 And then when you do that, it can go everywhere basically.

1:51:09.340 --> 1:51:11.320
 You can find these nanoparticles

1:51:11.320 --> 1:51:14.080
 in every tissue of the mouse.

1:51:14.080 --> 1:51:17.200
 But that's at a thousand fold higher concentration, right?

1:51:17.200 --> 1:51:21.180
 So I think at the levels that we're using in people,

1:51:21.180 --> 1:51:22.520
 most of it's staying in the muscle,

1:51:22.520 --> 1:51:25.620
 but sure, small amounts go elsewhere.

1:51:25.620 --> 1:51:30.460
 Could there be a lot of harm caused if it goes elsewhere?

1:51:30.460 --> 1:51:33.140
 Like let's say ridiculously high quantities.

1:51:33.140 --> 1:51:35.500
 I'm trying to understand what is the damage

1:51:35.500 --> 1:51:39.420
 that could be done from an RNA just floating about.

1:51:39.420 --> 1:51:41.260
 So the RNA itself is not gonna be a problem,

1:51:41.260 --> 1:51:43.940
 it's the protein that is encoded in it, right?

1:51:43.940 --> 1:51:48.820
 This is a viral RNA which has no sequence in us,

1:51:48.820 --> 1:51:50.540
 so there's nothing that it could do.

1:51:50.540 --> 1:51:54.040
 It's the protein that I would say you could ask,

1:51:54.040 --> 1:51:56.160
 what is that gonna do?

1:51:56.160 --> 1:52:00.580
 And the one property we know about the spike

1:52:01.740 --> 1:52:06.740
 is that it can cause fusion of cells, right?

1:52:06.740 --> 1:52:09.280
 That's how the virus gets in in the beginning.

1:52:09.280 --> 1:52:14.280
 The spike attaches to the cell by this H2 receptor

1:52:14.520 --> 1:52:19.180
 and it causes the virus and the cell to fuse.

1:52:19.180 --> 1:52:21.060
 And that's how the RNA gets out of the particle.

1:52:21.060 --> 1:52:24.100
 But so wait, I'm a bit confused.

1:52:24.100 --> 1:52:28.580
 So with this mRNA vaccine with the lipids and the RNA,

1:52:28.580 --> 1:52:30.700
 there's no spike, right?

1:52:30.700 --> 1:52:33.100
 The mRNA codes for the spike.

1:52:33.100 --> 1:52:35.860
 Oh, the mRNA codes, so it creates the spike.

1:52:35.860 --> 1:52:36.700
 Creates a spike.

1:52:36.700 --> 1:52:39.260
 And so that spike could cause fusion of cells.

1:52:39.260 --> 1:52:43.020
 Yes, except they modified the spike so it wouldn't.

1:52:44.240 --> 1:52:45.080
 Got it.

1:52:45.080 --> 1:52:46.420
 They made two amino acid changes in the spike

1:52:46.420 --> 1:52:47.260
 so it would not fuse.

1:52:47.260 --> 1:52:49.540
 So they understand enough which amino acids

1:52:49.540 --> 1:52:51.100
 are responsible for the fusion.

1:52:51.100 --> 1:52:51.940
 That's right.

1:52:51.940 --> 1:52:52.760
 Interesting.

1:52:52.760 --> 1:52:53.600
 This is so cool.

1:52:53.600 --> 1:52:54.440
 So they could modify it.

1:52:54.440 --> 1:52:57.140
 So now it's not gonna cause fusion, so that's not an issue.

1:52:57.140 --> 1:52:59.640
 It's called the prefusion stabilized spike.

1:53:00.980 --> 1:53:01.820
 Cool.

1:53:01.820 --> 1:53:03.180
 So the spike, when it binds ACE2,

1:53:04.160 --> 1:53:07.720
 that top falls off and the part of the spike

1:53:07.720 --> 1:53:09.300
 that causes fusion is now exposed.

1:53:09.300 --> 1:53:11.980
 And that doesn't happen in this mRNA vaccine.

1:53:11.980 --> 1:53:14.900
 So those are the things that could have happened,

1:53:14.900 --> 1:53:18.340
 but I think they're ruled out by what we've just said.

1:53:18.340 --> 1:53:19.700
 But there's no better test

1:53:19.700 --> 1:53:22.300
 than putting it into people, right?

1:53:22.300 --> 1:53:25.060
 And doing phase one, phase two, and phase three,

1:53:25.060 --> 1:53:27.620
 and increasing numbers of people and asking,

1:53:27.620 --> 1:53:28.860
 what do we see?

1:53:28.860 --> 1:53:30.860
 Do we have any concerns?

1:53:30.860 --> 1:53:35.260
 And so now it's been in many millions of people

1:53:35.260 --> 1:53:40.260
 and we don't see most of the effects you see in a vaccine,

1:53:40.820 --> 1:53:43.180
 you see in the first couple of months.

1:53:43.180 --> 1:53:46.060
 Things like the myocarditis with some of the vaccines,

1:53:46.060 --> 1:53:49.300
 the clotting issues with the AstraZeneca vaccine,

1:53:49.300 --> 1:53:53.480
 Guillain Barre, you see those relatively quickly.

1:53:54.860 --> 1:53:58.300
 And we've seen small numbers of those occur,

1:53:58.300 --> 1:54:01.460
 but other things we haven't seen,

1:54:01.460 --> 1:54:04.820
 and you never say never, right?

1:54:04.820 --> 1:54:07.780
 Right, so I mean, this is fascinating, right?

1:54:07.780 --> 1:54:12.780
 It's like I drink, I put Splenda in my coffee

1:54:12.780 --> 1:54:17.780
 and it has supposedly no calories,

1:54:20.460 --> 1:54:22.340
 but it tastes really good.

1:54:22.340 --> 1:54:26.140
 And despite what like rumors and blogs and so on,

1:54:26.140 --> 1:54:28.900
 I have not seen good medical evidence

1:54:28.900 --> 1:54:33.560
 that is harmful to you, but it's like, it tastes too good.

1:54:33.560 --> 1:54:35.420
 So I'm thinking like,

1:54:35.420 --> 1:54:37.740
 there's gotta be longterm consequences,

1:54:37.740 --> 1:54:40.020
 but it's very difficult to understand

1:54:40.020 --> 1:54:43.100
 what the longterm consequences are.

1:54:43.100 --> 1:54:47.660
 And there's this kind of like distant fear

1:54:47.660 --> 1:54:49.540
 or anxiety about it.

1:54:49.540 --> 1:54:53.020
 Like this thing tastes too good, it's too good to be true.

1:54:53.020 --> 1:54:55.700
 There's gotta be, there's no free lunch in this world.

1:54:55.700 --> 1:54:57.820
 This is the kind of feeling that people have

1:54:57.820 --> 1:55:00.320
 about the longterm effects of the vaccine,

1:55:01.660 --> 1:55:04.420
 that you mentioned that there's some intuition

1:55:04.420 --> 1:55:09.000
 about near term effects that you want to remove,

1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:11.500
 like the diffusion of cells and all those kinds of things,

1:55:11.500 --> 1:55:12.860
 but they think, okay,

1:55:12.860 --> 1:55:14.860
 this travels to other cells in the body,

1:55:14.860 --> 1:55:18.660
 this travels to neurons or that kind of stuff.

1:55:18.660 --> 1:55:20.700
 And then what kind of effect does that have longterm

1:55:20.700 --> 1:55:22.680
 that's yet to be discovered?

1:55:22.680 --> 1:55:25.140
 What do you make me for this vaccine,

1:55:25.140 --> 1:55:28.240
 but in general in science about making statements

1:55:28.240 --> 1:55:32.260
 about longterm negative effects?

1:55:32.260 --> 1:55:34.500
 Is that something that weighs heavy on you?

1:55:34.500 --> 1:55:36.440
 Is that something we can kind of escape

1:55:36.440 --> 1:55:39.020
 through just large scale experimentation

1:55:39.020 --> 1:55:41.300
 with animals and humans?

1:55:41.300 --> 1:55:44.220
 Well, if you're really, if you're concerned about longterm,

1:55:44.220 --> 1:55:46.700
 then you have to do a longterm experiment, right?

1:55:46.700 --> 1:55:50.580
 And maybe you don't see something for 50, 60 years.

1:55:50.580 --> 1:55:53.060
 So if someone says to you,

1:55:53.060 --> 1:55:56.620
 there are no longterm effects of the COVID vaccines,

1:55:56.620 --> 1:55:57.460
 they can't say that

1:55:57.460 --> 1:56:00.280
 because they haven't done the long experiment, right?

1:56:00.280 --> 1:56:02.820
 There's always the possibility, but you have to weigh it.

1:56:02.820 --> 1:56:06.120
 It's always, there's no free lunch, right?

1:56:06.120 --> 1:56:10.300
 There's always a risk benefit calculation you have to make.

1:56:10.300 --> 1:56:14.060
 You can have the study, it goes 50 years and then decide,

1:56:14.060 --> 1:56:18.020
 but I guess what you're doing is just like we said,

1:56:19.080 --> 1:56:22.200
 I forget which one, with polio, with rabies, I forget,

1:56:22.200 --> 1:56:25.460
 but you're weighing the side effects.

1:56:25.460 --> 1:56:26.460
 Yeah, polio, right.

1:56:26.460 --> 1:56:31.100
 The vaccine versus the effects of the virus.

1:56:31.100 --> 1:56:34.540
 And like both of them, you don't know longterm effects,

1:56:34.540 --> 1:56:38.620
 but you're building up intuition as you study,

1:56:38.620 --> 1:56:41.140
 which what are the longterm effects?

1:56:41.140 --> 1:56:46.140
 Like there's a huge number of people,

1:56:46.140 --> 1:56:51.140
 like that have like, I don't want to say experts

1:56:51.460 --> 1:56:52.420
 because I don't like the word,

1:56:52.420 --> 1:56:54.460
 but people have studied it long enough

1:56:54.460 --> 1:56:56.260
 to where they build up intuition.

1:56:56.260 --> 1:56:57.780
 They don't know for sure.

1:56:57.780 --> 1:57:00.580
 There's basic science being done, there's basic studies.

1:57:00.580 --> 1:57:05.580
 But you start to build up an intuition of what might be

1:57:05.880 --> 1:57:08.580
 a problem down the line and what is not,

1:57:08.580 --> 1:57:09.980
 biologically speaking.

1:57:09.980 --> 1:57:14.260
 And so given that map, then considering the virus,

1:57:14.260 --> 1:57:16.800
 there seems to be a lot of evidence for COVID

1:57:16.800 --> 1:57:21.800
 having negative effects on all aspects of the body,

1:57:21.820 --> 1:57:24.860
 not just even respiratory, which is kind of interesting.

1:57:24.860 --> 1:57:27.060
 So the cognitive stuff is terrifying.

1:57:27.060 --> 1:57:28.940
 All kinds of systems evolve, yes.

1:57:28.940 --> 1:57:32.380
 And then you look at the same thing with the vaccine

1:57:32.380 --> 1:57:34.700
 and there seems to be less of that.

1:57:34.700 --> 1:57:36.340
 But of course you don't know

1:57:36.340 --> 1:57:39.260
 if it's some kind of dormant thing that's just going to.

1:57:39.260 --> 1:57:40.380
 You won't know.

1:57:40.380 --> 1:57:42.580
 You have to make a judgment.

1:57:42.580 --> 1:57:44.900
 And for a lot of people they can't, right?

1:57:44.900 --> 1:57:47.580
 Because they don't have the tools to make the judgment.

1:57:47.580 --> 1:57:49.340
 I totally understand that.

1:57:49.340 --> 1:57:54.340
 And we have let people down a few times in medicine, right?

1:57:54.340 --> 1:57:57.820
 And I know two very specific examples.

1:57:57.820 --> 1:58:00.580
 The first polio vaccine ever made,

1:58:00.580 --> 1:58:03.380
 the Salk vaccine was released in 1955.

1:58:04.460 --> 1:58:06.420
 Immediately within months,

1:58:06.420 --> 1:58:09.460
 a few hundred cases of paralysis in kids who got it

1:58:09.460 --> 1:58:12.940
 because it was not properly inactivated.

1:58:14.180 --> 1:58:15.340
 Now you have to understand,

1:58:15.340 --> 1:58:17.820
 parents were dying for a polio vaccine

1:58:17.820 --> 1:58:20.020
 because kids were getting paralyzed every summer,

1:58:20.020 --> 1:58:22.340
 30,000 kids a year.

1:58:22.340 --> 1:58:24.860
 And so they went and took it.

1:58:24.860 --> 1:58:27.060
 They took the word of the medical establishment

1:58:27.060 --> 1:58:29.580
 that it was safe and it wasn't.

1:58:29.580 --> 1:58:31.980
 Big letdown, never going to forget something.

1:58:31.980 --> 1:58:36.020
 Although I think a lot of people today aren't aware of that.

1:58:36.020 --> 1:58:38.220
 I think that was a big problem that's everlasting.

1:58:38.220 --> 1:58:42.060
 Then the attenuated vaccine that we talked about,

1:58:42.060 --> 1:58:45.900
 the infectious causing polio.

1:58:45.900 --> 1:58:49.940
 Yet parents continued to bring their kids to be vaccinated

1:58:49.940 --> 1:58:50.780
 because they were said,

1:58:50.780 --> 1:58:52.380
 this is the right thing to do.

1:58:52.380 --> 1:58:53.220
 And I have to say,

1:58:53.220 --> 1:58:55.020
 I was involved in several lawsuits

1:58:55.020 --> 1:58:58.420
 where parents of a kid who got paralyzed

1:58:58.420 --> 1:59:01.860
 from the polio vaccine decided to sue the manufacturer

1:59:01.860 --> 1:59:04.620
 and get some money for their kid.

1:59:04.620 --> 1:59:07.020
 And so they got mad.

1:59:07.020 --> 1:59:10.020
 And I think you could not...

1:59:11.620 --> 1:59:14.620
 The first issue could have been prevented,

1:59:15.780 --> 1:59:18.540
 could have been prevented by inactivating it properly.

1:59:18.540 --> 1:59:21.180
 I think the company just did the wrong thing.

1:59:21.180 --> 1:59:23.220
 The second we had evidence for,

1:59:23.220 --> 1:59:25.900
 and we should probably have not used that vaccine any longer,

1:59:25.900 --> 1:59:28.180
 but I think that destroys public confidence.

1:59:28.180 --> 1:59:29.220
 But those aren't...

1:59:29.220 --> 1:59:30.060
 They're not long term.

1:59:30.060 --> 1:59:30.900
 That's a minority of cases.

1:59:30.900 --> 1:59:31.740
 This is a minority.

1:59:31.740 --> 1:59:32.580
 This is a very rare event, yeah.

1:59:32.580 --> 1:59:33.420
 But nevertheless,

1:59:33.420 --> 1:59:38.420
 science as an institution didn't make corrections

1:59:38.700 --> 1:59:39.540
 in that case.

1:59:39.540 --> 1:59:40.380
 No, they didn't.

1:59:40.380 --> 1:59:44.580
 And so what do you make of that?

1:59:44.580 --> 1:59:45.980
 I mean, it's very unfortunate

1:59:45.980 --> 1:59:49.460
 that those few things can destroy trust.

1:59:49.460 --> 1:59:51.140
 But I don't think that lasts till today.

1:59:51.140 --> 1:59:53.660
 I think today is a different era, right?

1:59:53.660 --> 1:59:55.340
 And most people don't know about those stories.

1:59:55.340 --> 1:59:58.900
 I tell them to you because that's what could happen.

1:59:58.900 --> 2:00:01.340
 I think it could happen today.

2:00:01.340 --> 2:00:05.620
 If you look at the history of the polio vaccine,

2:00:06.620 --> 2:00:10.820
 the US Public Health Service wanted kids to be vaccinated.

2:00:10.820 --> 2:00:13.500
 So they did things that probably weren't correct

2:00:13.500 --> 2:00:15.740
 to get the vaccine back online.

2:00:15.740 --> 2:00:16.580
 Right?

2:00:16.580 --> 2:00:19.020
 But they did it and they pushed it through.

2:00:20.300 --> 2:00:23.660
 So the question is, what do we do today?

2:00:23.660 --> 2:00:27.300
 So I can look at, as we just said,

2:00:27.300 --> 2:00:29.100
 I can look at what might happen

2:00:29.100 --> 2:00:33.300
 and I can make reasonable decisions

2:00:33.300 --> 2:00:35.060
 about the likelihood of them happening.

2:00:35.060 --> 2:00:38.940
 And I can also say, I don't wanna get COVID of any kind

2:00:38.940 --> 2:00:41.700
 because I've seen how nasty it can be.

2:00:41.700 --> 2:00:44.020
 And I decide I'm taking the risk,

2:00:44.020 --> 2:00:46.060
 whatever small of a long term effect,

2:00:46.060 --> 2:00:47.020
 I'm gonna take the risk.

2:00:47.020 --> 2:00:49.980
 My family took the risk and many other people did.

2:00:49.980 --> 2:00:50.900
 Of a vaccine.

2:00:50.900 --> 2:00:52.460
 Of getting vaccinated.

2:00:52.460 --> 2:00:53.980
 Because I think it's very small.

2:00:53.980 --> 2:00:56.900
 But I understand where people can't make that decision.

2:00:56.900 --> 2:00:58.380
 And that begs the question,

2:00:58.380 --> 2:01:01.260
 what would they need to make a decision?

2:01:01.260 --> 2:01:05.420
 So if you're concerned about an effect in 40 years,

2:01:06.820 --> 2:01:09.180
 we're not gonna know for 40 years.

2:01:09.180 --> 2:01:11.020
 Yeah, so I think if I were to speak,

2:01:11.020 --> 2:01:14.820
 because I talked to, like I mentioned offline to Joe Rogan

2:01:14.820 --> 2:01:15.980
 and his podcast yesterday,

2:01:15.980 --> 2:01:18.780
 I talked to him all the time about this.

2:01:18.780 --> 2:01:23.780
 I think the concern is less about the long term effects

2:01:27.260 --> 2:01:28.460
 like on paper.

2:01:28.460 --> 2:01:33.460
 It's more about the, like people like Anthony Fauci

2:01:34.540 --> 2:01:39.140
 and people at the top are simply misrepresenting the data

2:01:39.140 --> 2:01:42.980
 or like are not accurately being transparent.

2:01:42.980 --> 2:01:45.020
 Not collecting the data properly.

2:01:45.020 --> 2:01:46.820
 Not reporting on the data properly.

2:01:46.820 --> 2:01:48.300
 Not being transparent.

2:01:48.300 --> 2:01:50.380
 Not representing the uncertainties.

2:01:50.380 --> 2:01:55.380
 Not openly saying they were wrong two months ago.

2:01:55.780 --> 2:01:58.100
 Like in a way that's not like dramatic,

2:01:58.100 --> 2:02:00.980
 but revealing the basic process of science

2:02:00.980 --> 2:02:03.740
 when you have to do your best under uncertainty.

2:02:03.740 --> 2:02:06.060
 Just also just being inauthentic.

2:02:06.060 --> 2:02:09.500
 There's a sense, especially with like a younger generation

2:02:09.500 --> 2:02:11.700
 now, there's a certain way on the internet.

2:02:11.700 --> 2:02:14.260
 Like the internet can smell bullshit

2:02:14.260 --> 2:02:16.900
 much better than previous generations could.

2:02:16.900 --> 2:02:21.740
 And so they see there's a kind of inauthenticity

2:02:21.740 --> 2:02:26.420
 that comes with being like representing authority.

2:02:26.420 --> 2:02:27.980
 Like I am a scientist.

2:02:27.980 --> 2:02:29.020
 I'm an expert.

2:02:29.020 --> 2:02:30.460
 I have a PhD.

2:02:30.460 --> 2:02:31.900
 I have four decades of work.

2:02:31.900 --> 2:02:34.020
 Therefore everyone should listen to me.

2:02:34.020 --> 2:02:38.940
 And somehow that maps to this feeling of,

2:02:38.940 --> 2:02:40.740
 well, what are they hiding?

2:02:40.740 --> 2:02:43.100
 If they're speaking from authority like this,

2:02:43.100 --> 2:02:45.740
 if everyone is in agreement like this,

2:02:45.740 --> 2:02:48.180
 that means they all have emails between each other.

2:02:48.180 --> 2:02:49.500
 They said, we're gonna tell this.

2:02:49.500 --> 2:02:51.860
 This is the message we're gonna tell the public.

2:02:51.860 --> 2:02:54.860
 Then what is the truth, the actual truth?

2:02:54.860 --> 2:02:57.220
 Maybe there's a much bigger uncertainty.

2:02:57.220 --> 2:02:59.980
 Maybe there's dead people in the basement

2:02:59.980 --> 2:03:03.860
 that they're hiding from bad mRNA vaccine experiments.

2:03:03.860 --> 2:03:06.660
 Maybe they're, and then the conspiracy theory

2:03:06.660 --> 2:03:09.140
 starts to grow naturally

2:03:09.140 --> 2:03:11.860
 when there's this kind of mistrust of that.

2:03:11.860 --> 2:03:16.860
 So it's less about kind of like a deep concern

2:03:17.180 --> 2:03:18.980
 about longterm effects.

2:03:18.980 --> 2:03:22.540
 It's a concern about longterm effects

2:03:24.660 --> 2:03:27.100
 if we find out that there's some secret stuff

2:03:27.100 --> 2:03:28.420
 that we're not being told.

2:03:28.420 --> 2:03:30.060
 It all lands on that.

2:03:30.060 --> 2:03:32.380
 So what the heck, I mean, so I put the blame

2:03:32.380 --> 2:03:35.580
 not on the data, but basically on the leaders

2:03:35.580 --> 2:03:39.260
 and the communicators of the science at the top.

2:03:39.260 --> 2:03:43.780
 Well, to that I would say all the data,

2:03:43.780 --> 2:03:46.020
 as far as I know, are made public.

2:03:47.060 --> 2:03:48.780
 So you can dive into it.

2:03:48.780 --> 2:03:51.540
 And I know a lot of people ask me questions

2:03:51.540 --> 2:03:54.180
 and I just say, it's right here in the data.

2:03:54.180 --> 2:03:55.820
 And I know a lot of people can't do that.

2:03:55.820 --> 2:03:57.460
 They can't dive into it.

2:03:57.460 --> 2:04:00.340
 But that's one solution for people who are able.

2:04:00.340 --> 2:04:01.860
 Now you could argue, well,

2:04:01.860 --> 2:04:03.460
 maybe they've left data out.

2:04:03.460 --> 2:04:05.460
 Well, then not even I can help

2:04:05.460 --> 2:04:07.180
 because then they're hiding it from me too.

2:04:07.180 --> 2:04:08.580
 And I think that's highly unlikely.

2:04:08.580 --> 2:04:09.940
 I think for the most part,

2:04:09.940 --> 2:04:11.860
 the FDA requires the release

2:04:11.860 --> 2:04:14.260
 of all the clinical trial data, right?

2:04:14.260 --> 2:04:17.600
 So, okay, so this clinical trial data, that's one thing.

2:04:17.600 --> 2:04:20.180
 So that's the data that we should be focusing on, right?

2:04:20.180 --> 2:04:24.180
 So there's a lot of different data sets here.

2:04:24.180 --> 2:04:25.700
 So there's preclinical data,

2:04:25.700 --> 2:04:28.260
 which is everything that was done in the lab

2:04:28.260 --> 2:04:30.900
 before this vaccine ever went into a human arm.

2:04:30.900 --> 2:04:32.260
 It's all the cell culture work

2:04:32.260 --> 2:04:35.900
 that we talked about a little, experiments in animals.

2:04:35.900 --> 2:04:38.380
 All of that is publicly accessible.

2:04:38.380 --> 2:04:39.980
 Most of it gets published.

2:04:39.980 --> 2:04:42.580
 And then there's the initial drug filing,

2:04:42.580 --> 2:04:45.060
 which is huge, the books of,

2:04:45.060 --> 2:04:46.980
 you can get that and look at it, right?

2:04:46.980 --> 2:04:49.820
 This is me sort of asking sort of difficult questions here.

2:04:49.820 --> 2:04:50.660
 It's okay.

2:04:51.980 --> 2:04:56.060
 So there's a lot of money to be made by makers of the vaccine.

2:04:56.060 --> 2:05:00.940
 So for these companies, and obviously there's a distrust

2:05:00.940 --> 2:05:02.460
 of those folks too.

2:05:02.460 --> 2:05:04.540
 They've done a lot of really good things in this world,

2:05:04.540 --> 2:05:07.380
 but the incentives are such

2:05:07.380 --> 2:05:09.940
 that you wanna sweep stuff under the rug

2:05:09.940 --> 2:05:14.940
 if you're not 100% pure in your ethics.

2:05:15.420 --> 2:05:20.420
 And how hard is it for that data to be fabricated,

2:05:21.140 --> 2:05:24.540
 manipulated, like what's your intuition

2:05:24.540 --> 2:05:26.100
 for the pre trial stuff?

2:05:26.100 --> 2:05:29.020
 I think when you start fabricating,

2:05:29.020 --> 2:05:31.380
 then you get inconsistencies,

2:05:31.380 --> 2:05:34.380
 which are pretty easy to pick up.

2:05:34.380 --> 2:05:36.700
 When you're talking about some large scale things

2:05:36.700 --> 2:05:38.020
 of this nature.

2:05:38.020 --> 2:05:40.940
 Because then you can look through the data very,

2:05:40.940 --> 2:05:43.660
 you're gonna, I mean, we require looking very carefully,

2:05:43.660 --> 2:05:46.860
 but you will see inconsistencies from one trial to another.

2:05:46.860 --> 2:05:50.740
 And that might ring a bell that something's been done.

2:05:50.740 --> 2:05:55.180
 Yeah, it's like the moon landing thing.

2:05:55.180 --> 2:05:58.380
 Sometimes like going to the moon is easier than faking it.

2:05:58.380 --> 2:06:00.100
 Right.

2:06:00.100 --> 2:06:03.380
 In the sense it might be easier to do a large scale trial

2:06:03.380 --> 2:06:05.940
 and get an effective vaccine versus faking it.

2:06:05.940 --> 2:06:08.340
 But when you brought up the for profit issue,

2:06:08.340 --> 2:06:11.460
 I think that is always been an issue.

2:06:11.460 --> 2:06:15.780
 I've always felt that having your health depend

2:06:15.780 --> 2:06:20.780
 on for profit industry may not be the best solution.

2:06:20.820 --> 2:06:23.180
 And I don't know how else to do it.

2:06:23.180 --> 2:06:26.540
 People tell me I'm a dreamer that thinking that,

2:06:26.540 --> 2:06:28.300
 all medicines could be nonprofit.

2:06:28.300 --> 2:06:30.980
 But I also think that the world should have one health

2:06:30.980 --> 2:06:32.780
 system that takes care of everyone, right?

2:06:32.780 --> 2:06:34.700
 Because there's some countries that can't

2:06:34.700 --> 2:06:37.580
 and other countries have an excess like us.

2:06:37.580 --> 2:06:40.220
 So I wish we could do that.

2:06:40.220 --> 2:06:44.140
 Well, the argument is the speed of which the vaccines

2:06:44.140 --> 2:06:47.420
 for COVID were produced would never happen

2:06:47.420 --> 2:06:49.180
 in a nonprofit system,

2:06:49.180 --> 2:06:51.700
 would never happen in a non capitalist system.

2:06:51.700 --> 2:06:56.060
 Oh, I could set up a vaccine production institute

2:06:56.060 --> 2:06:58.860
 in the US that would get the vaccines done

2:06:58.860 --> 2:07:00.860
 because you just need to put money into it.

2:07:00.860 --> 2:07:03.540
 That's what made these vaccines get done money.

2:07:03.540 --> 2:07:06.900
 They poured billions of dollars and they got it done quickly.

2:07:06.900 --> 2:07:09.700
 But if I set up a nonprofit institutes of vaccines

2:07:09.700 --> 2:07:12.500
 throughout the US staffed with really talented people,

2:07:12.500 --> 2:07:15.020
 pay them well, keep them motivated,

2:07:15.020 --> 2:07:15.860
 you'll get your vaccine.

2:07:15.860 --> 2:07:19.940
 No, but that's the thing with capitalism is that

2:07:19.940 --> 2:07:22.820
 the selection of who to hire a good,

2:07:22.820 --> 2:07:24.940
 when you say good people,

2:07:24.940 --> 2:07:28.140
 capitalism has a machine that fires people

2:07:28.140 --> 2:07:30.900
 who are not good and selects people that are good.

2:07:30.900 --> 2:07:32.660
 Coming from the Soviet Union,

2:07:32.660 --> 2:07:35.020
 the dream of communism is similar

2:07:35.020 --> 2:07:37.340
 to what you're saying broadly defined.

2:07:37.340 --> 2:07:40.020
 It certainly doesn't work in the broads.

2:07:40.020 --> 2:07:44.860
 The question of whether it works in the healthcare space,

2:07:45.820 --> 2:07:49.500
 there is some aspect to the machine of capitalism

2:07:49.500 --> 2:07:53.020
 being the most effective way to select for good people

2:07:53.020 --> 2:07:55.220
 and to effectively produce the thing.

2:07:56.100 --> 2:07:58.500
 But then of course, a lot of people would argue

2:07:58.500 --> 2:08:01.140
 the current, even the current healthcare is not

2:08:01.140 --> 2:08:03.620
 with like regulations, there's some weird mix

2:08:03.620 --> 2:08:07.060
 where there's a lot of opportunities for inefficiencies.

2:08:07.060 --> 2:08:09.020
 There's a lot of opportunities for bureaucracy.

2:08:09.020 --> 2:08:11.820
 So you have like the worst of all worlds.

2:08:11.820 --> 2:08:13.980
 Can't there be some intermediate that works

2:08:13.980 --> 2:08:17.260
 because I mean, the other issue that we haven't mentioned

2:08:17.260 --> 2:08:19.220
 is that politics gets thrown into this

2:08:19.220 --> 2:08:21.380
 and that really messes up

2:08:21.380 --> 2:08:22.980
 and it should never be mixed with healthcare,

2:08:22.980 --> 2:08:26.820
 but it is because a lot of funding comes from the government

2:08:26.820 --> 2:08:29.300
 so that's another confounding factor.

2:08:29.300 --> 2:08:33.660
 But I really think I could make a vaccine institute

2:08:33.660 --> 2:08:36.620
 that if someone didn't do well, I'd fire them.

2:08:36.620 --> 2:08:39.100
 No, you're not gonna stay if you can't do your job

2:08:39.100 --> 2:08:41.380
 and do it well, you don't give them incentives,

2:08:41.380 --> 2:08:44.700
 but it doesn't have to be the two extremes I think.

2:08:44.700 --> 2:08:47.740
 There has to be a solution that people don't have

2:08:47.740 --> 2:08:51.580
 this mistrust for a company making huge profits

2:08:51.580 --> 2:08:52.460
 off of a drug.

2:08:52.460 --> 2:08:54.100
 But you know what, it's funny,

2:08:55.340 --> 2:08:58.300
 it seems that vaccines and antivirals bear the brunt

2:08:58.300 --> 2:09:01.380
 of this criticism yet there are many other pharmaceuticals

2:09:01.380 --> 2:09:04.380
 that people rely on of all sorts.

2:09:04.380 --> 2:09:06.400
 They don't seem to question and have issues

2:09:06.400 --> 2:09:09.180
 with those and they have far more side effects than vaccines.

2:09:09.180 --> 2:09:11.900
 It's a very strange how we're picking that way,

2:09:11.900 --> 2:09:16.900
 but I should also say that if you have one big

2:09:17.420 --> 2:09:22.220
 vaccine institute, one of the other sets

2:09:22.220 --> 2:09:27.220
 of vaccine conspiracies, I mean, I would say they're

2:09:28.420 --> 2:09:32.460
 a little farther out into the wild side of ideas,

2:09:32.460 --> 2:09:37.220
 but there's one way to control the populace

2:09:37.220 --> 2:09:41.140
 is by injecting substances into them, right?

2:09:41.140 --> 2:09:44.860
 People, I mean, part of that, funny enough,

2:09:44.860 --> 2:09:46.180
 it probably has to do with needles

2:09:46.180 --> 2:09:48.940
 versus something you put in your mouth,

2:09:48.940 --> 2:09:50.820
 but there's something about the government,

2:09:50.820 --> 2:09:53.580
 especially when it's government mandated injection

2:09:53.580 --> 2:09:54.960
 of a substance into you.

2:09:54.960 --> 2:09:57.780
 I don't care what the science says,

2:09:57.780 --> 2:10:00.940
 if it's 100% effective, 100% safe,

2:10:00.940 --> 2:10:03.980
 there's a natural distrust of what,

2:10:03.980 --> 2:10:07.680
 like even if this is effective and safe,

2:10:08.660 --> 2:10:11.980
 giving the government power to do this,

2:10:11.980 --> 2:10:15.080
 aren't they gonna start getting ideas down the line for,

2:10:15.080 --> 2:10:15.920
 you know.

2:10:17.920 --> 2:10:20.760
 I think that they can barely govern.

2:10:20.760 --> 2:10:22.220
 I don't think they're gonna do that,

2:10:22.220 --> 2:10:25.980
 but you don't have to take, unless you're a federal employee,

2:10:25.980 --> 2:10:27.900
 you don't have to take a COVID vaccine.

2:10:27.900 --> 2:10:32.900
 Yeah, but that largely has to do, not largely,

2:10:32.980 --> 2:10:36.540
 but there is an individualistic spirit

2:10:39.740 --> 2:10:41.420
 to the American people.

2:10:41.420 --> 2:10:44.400
 There's this, like, you're not gonna take my gun away

2:10:44.400 --> 2:10:47.300
 from me, you're not going, and I think that,

2:10:52.420 --> 2:10:56.060
 that's something that makes America what it is.

2:10:56.060 --> 2:10:57.500
 Just coming from the Soviet Union,

2:10:57.500 --> 2:10:59.940
 there's a power to sort of resisting

2:10:59.940 --> 2:11:01.720
 the overreach of government.

2:11:01.720 --> 2:11:04.440
 That's quite interesting, because I'm a believer,

2:11:04.440 --> 2:11:08.020
 I hope that it's possible to have,

2:11:08.020 --> 2:11:11.600
 to strive towards a government that works extremely well.

2:11:11.600 --> 2:11:14.860
 I think at its best, a government represents the people

2:11:14.860 --> 2:11:17.880
 and functions in the similar way that you're mentioning,

2:11:17.880 --> 2:11:20.140
 but that, like, pushback,

2:11:20.140 --> 2:11:22.580
 even if it turns into conspiracy theory sometimes,

2:11:22.580 --> 2:11:25.980
 I think is actually healthy in the long arc of history.

2:11:25.980 --> 2:11:28.100
 It can be frustrating sometimes,

2:11:28.100 --> 2:11:30.900
 but that mechanism of pushing back against power,

2:11:30.900 --> 2:11:32.980
 against authority, can be healthy.

2:11:32.980 --> 2:11:36.500
 I agree, I think it's fine to question the vaccines.

2:11:36.500 --> 2:11:39.060
 What I have issue with is that many people

2:11:40.140 --> 2:11:43.180
 put out incorrect information,

2:11:43.180 --> 2:11:45.380
 and I'm not sure what their motivations are,

2:11:45.380 --> 2:11:47.020
 and it's very hard to fight that,

2:11:47.020 --> 2:11:50.100
 because then it's my word versus theirs,

2:11:50.100 --> 2:11:52.340
 and I'm happy to talk with people

2:11:52.340 --> 2:11:54.300
 about any of their concerns,

2:11:54.300 --> 2:11:56.700
 but if you start getting into the stuff

2:11:56.700 --> 2:11:59.260
 that just isn't true, then we have a problem.

2:11:59.260 --> 2:12:03.340
 The thing I struggle with is conspiracy theories,

2:12:03.340 --> 2:12:04.660
 whatever language you want to use,

2:12:04.660 --> 2:12:09.360
 but sort of ideas that challenge

2:12:09.360 --> 2:12:12.100
 the mainstream quote unquote narrative,

2:12:13.600 --> 2:12:16.180
 given our current social media and internet,

2:12:16.180 --> 2:12:17.820
 like the way it operates,

2:12:17.820 --> 2:12:20.340
 they can become viral much easier.

2:12:20.340 --> 2:12:22.700
 There's something much more compelling about them.

2:12:22.700 --> 2:12:27.700
 Like I have a secret about the way things really work.

2:12:27.760 --> 2:12:30.200
 That becomes viral, and that's very frustrating,

2:12:30.200 --> 2:12:31.740
 because then you're not having

2:12:31.740 --> 2:12:33.420
 a conversation on level ground.

2:12:36.140 --> 2:12:38.280
 When you're trying to present scientific ideas,

2:12:38.280 --> 2:12:39.820
 and then there's conspiracy theories,

2:12:39.820 --> 2:12:42.780
 the conspiracy theories become viral much faster,

2:12:42.780 --> 2:12:44.820
 and then you're not just having a discussion

2:12:44.820 --> 2:12:45.840
 on level ground.

2:12:47.980 --> 2:12:49.180
 That's the frustrating part,

2:12:49.180 --> 2:12:51.880
 that it's not an even discussion.

2:12:51.880 --> 2:12:53.580
 Can I just say one more thing?

2:12:53.580 --> 2:12:54.860
 I mean, the internet is here to stay,

2:12:54.860 --> 2:12:56.140
 so we're gonna have to figure out

2:12:56.140 --> 2:12:57.300
 how to deal with it, right?

2:12:57.300 --> 2:12:59.340
 But from my perspective,

2:12:59.340 --> 2:13:03.020
 I was skeptical that any COVID vaccine

2:13:03.020 --> 2:13:05.860
 would be ready within a year.

2:13:05.860 --> 2:13:07.020
 That's amazing.

2:13:07.020 --> 2:13:12.020
 Plus, the way I look at the mRNA vaccine as a scientist,

2:13:12.340 --> 2:13:13.900
 it's gee whiz to me.

2:13:13.900 --> 2:13:15.560
 It's amazing that it worked,

2:13:15.560 --> 2:13:18.660
 and I think the data are great, so I want it.

2:13:19.980 --> 2:13:21.260
 As a scientist, I want it.

2:13:21.260 --> 2:13:23.140
 One of the really sad things, again,

2:13:23.140 --> 2:13:27.040
 with me, too, as a scientist or as an admirer of science,

2:13:29.780 --> 2:13:31.260
 I don't know if it's politics,

2:13:31.260 --> 2:13:34.940
 but one of the sad things to me about the previous year

2:13:34.940 --> 2:13:38.440
 is that I wasn't free to celebrate

2:13:38.440 --> 2:13:42.380
 the incredible accomplishment of science with the vaccines.

2:13:42.380 --> 2:13:44.140
 I was very skeptical that it's possible

2:13:44.140 --> 2:13:47.660
 to develop a vaccine so quickly.

2:13:47.660 --> 2:13:50.740
 So it's unfortunate that we can't celebrate

2:13:50.740 --> 2:13:54.100
 how amazing humans are to come up with this vaccine.

2:13:54.100 --> 2:13:57.300
 Now, this vaccine might have long term effects.

2:13:57.300 --> 2:14:00.180
 That doesn't mean this is not incredible.

2:14:00.180 --> 2:14:04.300
 Why couldn't you celebrate?

2:14:06.580 --> 2:14:08.620
 Because I would love to inspire the world

2:14:08.620 --> 2:14:11.340
 with the amazing things science can do.

2:14:11.340 --> 2:14:14.000
 And when you say something about the vaccines,

2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:15.660
 they're not listening to the science.

2:14:15.660 --> 2:14:17.440
 A lot of people are not listening to the science.

2:14:17.440 --> 2:14:22.440
 What they hear is, oh, you're a Republican

2:14:22.440 --> 2:14:25.220
 or you're a Democrat, and you're social signaling,

2:14:25.220 --> 2:14:26.700
 doing some kind of signaling.

2:14:26.700 --> 2:14:27.820
 No, I think that the vaccine,

2:14:27.820 --> 2:14:30.640
 you're talking about injecting something into you,

2:14:30.640 --> 2:14:33.740
 and maybe you're right that the rhetoric is like,

2:14:33.740 --> 2:14:36.140
 you better take this or you're dumb.

2:14:37.140 --> 2:14:38.460
 It's not the right approach.

2:14:38.460 --> 2:14:40.220
 I've seen, actually, it's kind of interesting.

2:14:40.220 --> 2:14:42.940
 I've seen both sides kind of imply that.

2:14:42.940 --> 2:14:47.780
 So the people who are against the vaccine

2:14:48.940 --> 2:14:52.260
 are dumb for not trusting science,

2:14:52.260 --> 2:14:55.680
 and the people who are for the vaccine

2:14:55.680 --> 2:14:59.380
 are called dumb for trusting science,

2:14:59.380 --> 2:15:00.220
 the scientific institution.

2:15:00.220 --> 2:15:01.820
 And nobody wins, yeah.

2:15:01.820 --> 2:15:03.960
 And they both kind of have a point.

2:15:03.960 --> 2:15:07.740
 Like, because you can always,

2:15:07.740 --> 2:15:10.260
 it's like, is the glass half full or half empty?

2:15:10.260 --> 2:15:15.260
 Because you can always look at, like, science

2:15:15.420 --> 2:15:18.160
 from a perspective of certain individuals

2:15:18.160 --> 2:15:22.740
 that don't represent, perhaps, the not greatest leaders,

2:15:23.580 --> 2:15:25.380
 almost like political leaders.

2:15:25.380 --> 2:15:27.620
 There's a lot of, you know,

2:15:27.620 --> 2:15:31.380
 yesterday I went on a whole rant against,

2:15:31.380 --> 2:15:34.140
 I said a lot of positive things about Anthony Fauci

2:15:34.140 --> 2:15:36.140
 before I went on a rant against him.

2:15:36.140 --> 2:15:40.020
 Because ultimately, you know,

2:15:40.020 --> 2:15:41.980
 I think he failed as a leader,

2:15:41.980 --> 2:15:44.260
 and I know it's very difficult to be a leader,

2:15:44.260 --> 2:15:47.340
 but I still wanted to hold him accountable for that

2:15:47.340 --> 2:15:50.700
 as a great communicator of science and as a great leader.

2:15:50.700 --> 2:15:52.300
 What do you think he didn't do right?

2:15:52.300 --> 2:15:53.140
 I'm curious.

2:15:55.060 --> 2:16:00.060
 So the core of the problem is the several characteristics

2:16:00.060 --> 2:16:05.060
 of the way he was communicating to the public.

2:16:06.540 --> 2:16:09.140
 So one is the general inauthenticity.

2:16:10.340 --> 2:16:14.500
 Two is a thing that, it's very hard to put into words,

2:16:14.500 --> 2:16:18.700
 but there's certain ways of speaking to people

2:16:18.700 --> 2:16:21.740
 that sounds like you're hiding something from them.

2:16:21.740 --> 2:16:23.980
 That sounds like you're full of shit.

2:16:23.980 --> 2:16:25.500
 That's the authenticity piece.

2:16:25.500 --> 2:16:30.500
 Like, it sounds like you're not really speaking

2:16:30.620 --> 2:16:34.460
 to the full truth of what you know

2:16:34.460 --> 2:16:38.420
 and that you did some shady shit in your past

2:16:38.420 --> 2:16:40.860
 that you're trying to hide.

2:16:40.860 --> 2:16:42.820
 So that's a way of communicating

2:16:42.820 --> 2:16:45.020
 that I think the internet and people in general

2:16:45.020 --> 2:16:46.780
 are becoming much better at detecting.

2:16:46.780 --> 2:16:48.620
 Yeah, it's like you said, they're good BS detectors.

2:16:48.620 --> 2:16:50.260
 Yeah, good BS detectors.

2:16:51.500 --> 2:16:55.380
 But contributing to that is speaking from authority,

2:16:55.380 --> 2:17:00.380
 speaking with authority and confidence

2:17:01.540 --> 2:17:04.500
 where neither is deserved.

2:17:04.500 --> 2:17:09.500
 So first of all, nobody's an authority on this new virus.

2:17:10.140 --> 2:17:12.220
 We're facing a deadly pandemic,

2:17:12.220 --> 2:17:15.260
 and especially in the early stages,

2:17:15.260 --> 2:17:17.540
 it was unclear how deadly it would be.

2:17:17.540 --> 2:17:19.660
 It was unclear, probably still unclear,

2:17:19.660 --> 2:17:22.140
 fully how it's transmitted.

2:17:22.140 --> 2:17:24.420
 The full dynamics of the virus,

2:17:24.420 --> 2:17:28.540
 the full understanding of which solutions work and not,

2:17:28.540 --> 2:17:31.220
 how well masks of different kinds work,

2:17:31.220 --> 2:17:34.260
 how easy or difficult it is to create tests,

2:17:34.260 --> 2:17:36.500
 how many months or years it's gonna take

2:17:36.500 --> 2:17:37.740
 to create a vaccine,

2:17:38.780 --> 2:17:43.140
 how well in history or currently do quarantine methods

2:17:43.140 --> 2:17:44.660
 or lockdown methods work,

2:17:45.620 --> 2:17:48.060
 what are the different data mechanisms

2:17:48.060 --> 2:17:50.740
 that are data collection mechanisms

2:17:50.740 --> 2:17:52.060
 that are being implemented,

2:17:52.060 --> 2:17:55.660
 what are the clear plans that need to happen,

2:17:55.660 --> 2:17:58.340
 what the epidemiology that's happening,

2:17:58.340 --> 2:18:00.140
 what is the uncertainty around that?

2:18:02.340 --> 2:18:05.620
 Then there's the geopolitical stuff with China.

2:18:09.140 --> 2:18:11.460
 I personally believe there should have been

2:18:11.460 --> 2:18:15.300
 much more openness about the origins of the virus,

2:18:15.300 --> 2:18:17.100
 whether they're leaked from a lab or not.

2:18:17.100 --> 2:18:21.180
 I think communicating that you're open to these ideas

2:18:21.180 --> 2:18:25.340
 is actually the way to get people to trust you,

2:18:25.340 --> 2:18:28.220
 that you are legitimately open to ideas

2:18:28.220 --> 2:18:31.260
 that are very unpleasant, that go against the mainstream.

2:18:32.540 --> 2:18:35.740
 Showing that openness is going to get people to trust you

2:18:35.740 --> 2:18:40.740
 when you finally decrease the variance in your uncertainty,

2:18:40.980 --> 2:18:42.820
 like decrease uncertainty and have,

2:18:42.820 --> 2:18:44.420
 we still have a lot of uncertainty,

2:18:44.420 --> 2:18:46.460
 but this is the best course of action.

2:18:46.460 --> 2:18:49.660
 Vaccines still have a lot of uncertainty around them.

2:18:49.660 --> 2:18:51.260
 mRNA is a new technology,

2:18:51.260 --> 2:18:53.300
 but we have increasing amounts of data,

2:18:53.300 --> 2:18:54.940
 and here's the data sources,

2:18:54.940 --> 2:18:58.740
 and laying them out in a very clear way

2:18:58.740 --> 2:19:01.260
 of this is the best course of action that we have now.

2:19:01.260 --> 2:19:04.060
 We don't know if it's the perfect course of action,

2:19:04.060 --> 2:19:06.420
 but it's by far the best course of action.

2:19:06.420 --> 2:19:09.460
 And that would come from a leader

2:19:09.460 --> 2:19:13.060
 that has earned the capital of trust from people.

2:19:13.060 --> 2:19:15.900
 I mean, I think in recent history,

2:19:15.900 --> 2:19:19.740
 the worst pandemic is 1918 flu, right?

2:19:19.740 --> 2:19:22.540
 But that's mainly because we didn't know what to do.

2:19:22.540 --> 2:19:24.420
 We didn't have many tools at our disposal.

2:19:24.420 --> 2:19:26.420
 And that was tied up with World War I.

2:19:26.420 --> 2:19:27.900
 That's right, that's right.

2:19:27.900 --> 2:19:30.300
 So the leadership there, I mean.

2:19:30.300 --> 2:19:32.820
 But I don't know what is a lot of deaths, right?

2:19:32.820 --> 2:19:35.420
 And any one person is someone's family,

2:19:35.420 --> 2:19:37.420
 so to them it's a lot, right?

2:19:37.420 --> 2:19:41.740
 But that logic, we don't apply that logic generally,

2:19:41.740 --> 2:19:43.420
 because there's a lot of people suffering

2:19:43.420 --> 2:19:44.860
 and dying throughout the world,

2:19:44.860 --> 2:19:47.780
 and we turn the other way all the time.

2:19:47.780 --> 2:19:49.100
 And that's the story of history.

2:19:49.100 --> 2:19:51.580
 So saying you all of a sudden.

2:19:51.580 --> 2:19:53.780
 What bothers me though, I mean, personally,

2:19:53.780 --> 2:19:56.180
 I don't like anyone dying anywhere,

2:19:56.180 --> 2:20:00.100
 but, and especially considering what technology

2:20:00.100 --> 2:20:02.340
 we're able to muster, yet we still kill each other.

2:20:02.340 --> 2:20:04.500
 It's just a dichotomy to me.

2:20:04.500 --> 2:20:07.660
 Yeah, but I mean, this is the, what is it, Paul Farmer?

2:20:08.940 --> 2:20:10.140
 There's these great stories.

2:20:10.140 --> 2:20:11.380
 I mean, that's the,

2:20:11.380 --> 2:20:16.380
 that's the burden of being in healthcare,

2:20:17.460 --> 2:20:22.460
 being a doctor, is you have to help.

2:20:23.060 --> 2:20:25.260
 You can't help but help a person in front of you

2:20:25.260 --> 2:20:28.580
 who's hurting, but you also are burdened

2:20:28.580 --> 2:20:31.420
 by the knowledge that you helping them,

2:20:31.420 --> 2:20:34.860
 you spending money and effort and time on them,

2:20:34.860 --> 2:20:36.860
 means you're not going to help others,

2:20:36.860 --> 2:20:38.540
 and you cannot possibly allocate

2:20:38.540 --> 2:20:40.220
 that amount of time to everybody.

2:20:40.220 --> 2:20:44.060
 So you're choosing which person lives and which person dies.

2:20:44.060 --> 2:20:45.420
 And you're doing so,

2:20:45.420 --> 2:20:47.740
 the reason you're helping the person in front of you

2:20:47.740 --> 2:20:49.460
 is because they're in front of you.

2:20:49.460 --> 2:20:53.260
 And so the reason right now we care a lot about COVID

2:20:53.260 --> 2:20:56.620
 is because the eye of the world has turned to COVID,

2:20:56.620 --> 2:20:59.300
 but we're not seeing all the other atrocities

2:20:59.300 --> 2:21:00.460
 going on in the world.

2:21:00.460 --> 2:21:02.780
 They're not necessarily related to deaths,

2:21:02.780 --> 2:21:05.260
 they're related to suffering, human suffering,

2:21:05.260 --> 2:21:07.420
 which you could argue is worse than death,

2:21:07.420 --> 2:21:08.660
 prolonged suffering.

2:21:08.660 --> 2:21:11.620
 So there's all of these questions.

2:21:11.620 --> 2:21:15.740
 And the fundamental question here is,

2:21:15.740 --> 2:21:19.340
 are we overreacting to COVID in our policies?

2:21:19.340 --> 2:21:23.700
 So this is the, when we turn our eye

2:21:23.700 --> 2:21:26.900
 and care about this particular thing and not other things,

2:21:26.900 --> 2:21:29.180
 are we dismissing the pain that business owners

2:21:29.180 --> 2:21:31.660
 who've lost their businesses are going to feel?

2:21:31.660 --> 2:21:35.660
 And then the long, talking about long COVID,

2:21:35.660 --> 2:21:39.380
 the long term effects, economic effects on the millions

2:21:39.380 --> 2:21:42.460
 of people that will suffer, that suffer financially,

2:21:42.460 --> 2:21:44.820
 but also suffer from their dreams

2:21:44.820 --> 2:21:46.660
 being completely collapsed.

2:21:46.660 --> 2:21:50.700
 So a lot of people seek gain meaning from work.

2:21:50.700 --> 2:21:52.820
 And if you take away that work,

2:21:52.820 --> 2:21:55.660
 there's anger that can be born, there's pain.

2:21:55.660 --> 2:21:57.180
 And so what does that lead to?

2:21:57.180 --> 2:22:01.860
 That can lead to the rising up of charismatic leaders

2:22:01.860 --> 2:22:05.100
 that channel that anger towards destructive things.

2:22:05.100 --> 2:22:06.700
 That's been done throughout history.

2:22:06.700 --> 2:22:10.220
 So you have to balance that with the policies

2:22:10.220 --> 2:22:12.060
 that you have in COVID.

2:22:12.060 --> 2:22:16.220
 And then, I mean, very much my main opposition

2:22:16.220 --> 2:22:20.700
 to Fauci is not on the details, but the final result,

2:22:20.700 --> 2:22:25.020
 which is I just observe that there's a significant decrease

2:22:25.020 --> 2:22:30.020
 in trust in science as a, not the institution,

2:22:30.500 --> 2:22:32.700
 but the very sort of mechanisms of science.

2:22:32.700 --> 2:22:35.860
 I think science is both beautiful and powerful.

2:22:35.860 --> 2:22:38.220
 And the reason why we have so many amazing things

2:22:38.220 --> 2:22:40.460
 and such a high quality of life.

2:22:40.460 --> 2:22:44.020
 And distrust in that, that the thing we need now

2:22:44.020 --> 2:22:46.580
 to get out of all the troubles we're in,

2:22:46.580 --> 2:22:49.660
 continue getting out of the troubles we're in is science,

2:22:49.660 --> 2:22:53.300
 the scientific process, broadly defined like innovation,

2:22:53.300 --> 2:22:55.660
 technological innovation, scientific innovation,

2:22:55.660 --> 2:23:00.660
 all of that, distrust in that is totally

2:23:00.860 --> 2:23:02.460
 the wrong thing we need.

2:23:02.460 --> 2:23:04.780
 And so anybody who gets in,

2:23:04.780 --> 2:23:07.860
 who causes a distrust in science to me,

2:23:12.220 --> 2:23:14.220
 carries the responsibility of that

2:23:14.220 --> 2:23:16.980
 and should be in, because the response,

2:23:16.980 --> 2:23:20.060
 I mean, should be fired, should be,

2:23:20.060 --> 2:23:24.380
 or at least openly have to carry the burden of that,

2:23:24.380 --> 2:23:27.460
 of having caused of that kind of level of mistrust.

2:23:27.460 --> 2:23:30.460
 Now, it's maybe unfair to place it on any one individual,

2:23:30.460 --> 2:23:34.060
 but you have to, I think in your pocket said,

2:23:34.060 --> 2:23:37.660
 the buck stops at the top, like the leaders have to.

2:23:37.660 --> 2:23:40.980
 No, no, there's a clear leader here, yes, absolutely.

2:23:40.980 --> 2:23:44.060
 So even if it's not directly his fault,

2:23:44.060 --> 2:23:48.340
 he has to carry the price of that.

2:23:48.340 --> 2:23:50.900
 Do you think we should at this point say,

2:23:50.900 --> 2:23:53.420
 okay, we have vaccines,

2:23:53.420 --> 2:23:55.420
 you can decide whether you take them or not,

2:23:55.420 --> 2:23:56.540
 let's move forward?

2:23:57.420 --> 2:23:59.180
 Maybe you can help me understand this,

2:23:59.180 --> 2:24:04.180
 because it seems like, why is that not the right solution?

2:24:04.540 --> 2:24:07.220
 Completely open society, the vaccines,

2:24:07.220 --> 2:24:09.780
 at least in the United States,

2:24:09.780 --> 2:24:14.140
 as I understand are widely available.

2:24:14.140 --> 2:24:18.340
 So this is the American way, you have the decision to make.

2:24:18.340 --> 2:24:23.260
 If you have conditions that make you worried to get COVID

2:24:23.260 --> 2:24:26.180
 and go to the hospital, then you should get vaccinated

2:24:26.180 --> 2:24:27.820
 because here's the data that shows

2:24:27.820 --> 2:24:30.820
 that it's much less likely for you to die

2:24:31.980 --> 2:24:34.260
 if you get vaccinated,

2:24:34.260 --> 2:24:35.780
 if you don't want to get vaccinated

2:24:35.780 --> 2:24:39.300
 because you're worried about longterm effects of vaccine

2:24:39.300 --> 2:24:40.340
 that you don't have to,

2:24:40.340 --> 2:24:43.100
 but then you suffer the consequences of that,

2:24:43.100 --> 2:24:44.420
 and that's it.

2:24:44.420 --> 2:24:47.260
 So here's what I think is driving,

2:24:47.260 --> 2:24:48.700
 I think it's all about kids,

2:24:50.220 --> 2:24:51.940
 because they're gonna go back to school in the fall

2:24:51.940 --> 2:24:53.980
 and many of them can't be vaccinated.

2:24:53.980 --> 2:24:58.980
 So if they get infected, they do have less frequency

2:24:59.060 --> 2:25:01.260
 of disease, but it's not zero.

2:25:01.260 --> 2:25:04.740
 They do get sick and they can have longterm consequences.

2:25:04.740 --> 2:25:09.340
 And at that age, it would be a shame, right?

2:25:09.340 --> 2:25:10.620
 And not even their choice,

2:25:10.620 --> 2:25:13.460
 they can't decide to get vaccinated or not

2:25:13.460 --> 2:25:15.220
 because they can't have access to it.

2:25:15.220 --> 2:25:19.380
 So I think that's what would drive my efforts

2:25:19.380 --> 2:25:22.540
 to try and get more people, at least in schools, vaccinated,

2:25:22.540 --> 2:25:24.660
 but I might be wrong, it may not be that.

2:25:24.660 --> 2:25:26.540
 So can you kind of dig into that a little bit?

2:25:26.540 --> 2:25:27.380
 So there's,

2:25:30.740 --> 2:25:33.260
 so you're saying that there should be an effort

2:25:33.260 --> 2:25:37.620
 for increased vaccinations of kids going to school,

2:25:37.620 --> 2:25:39.900
 just not for societal benefit,

2:25:39.900 --> 2:25:42.260
 but for the benefit of each individual kid, right?

2:25:42.260 --> 2:25:46.140
 So right now, kids under 12, right,

2:25:46.140 --> 2:25:48.540
 are not yet vaccinated, is that correct?

2:25:48.540 --> 2:25:49.940
 Yeah, I think so.

2:25:49.940 --> 2:25:53.420
 And it's not gonna be in time for school opening

2:25:53.420 --> 2:25:54.780
 that they get vaccinated.

2:25:56.700 --> 2:25:59.700
 And then, I suppose the teachers

2:25:59.700 --> 2:26:01.380
 are all gonna be vaccinated,

2:26:01.380 --> 2:26:02.780
 makes sense for them to do that,

2:26:02.780 --> 2:26:04.100
 but I'm just worried the kids

2:26:04.100 --> 2:26:05.980
 are gonna be transmitting it amongst them

2:26:05.980 --> 2:26:08.900
 and many states don't allow mask mandate in school.

2:26:08.900 --> 2:26:13.900
 So I think that's what's driving the larger narrative

2:26:14.060 --> 2:26:16.740
 in the US to protect kids.

2:26:16.740 --> 2:26:18.940
 It's kind of what I hear from Daniel Griffin,

2:26:18.940 --> 2:26:21.620
 because increasing numbers of kids

2:26:21.620 --> 2:26:23.980
 are being admitted to hospitals now,

2:26:23.980 --> 2:26:28.260
 because they're becoming the major unvaccinated population.

2:26:28.260 --> 2:26:29.620
 They're hanging out over the summer

2:26:29.620 --> 2:26:32.260
 and that's just gonna get worse in the fall.

2:26:32.260 --> 2:26:35.380
 And so you could have a lot of kids with long COVID

2:26:35.380 --> 2:26:38.300
 and disabled their entire lives, right, so.

2:26:38.300 --> 2:26:42.060
 And of course, hearing from people who are vaccine hesitant,

2:26:42.060 --> 2:26:44.820
 I hear exactly the kids statement,

2:26:44.820 --> 2:26:47.100
 but they're saying they don't want

2:26:47.100 --> 2:26:52.100
 the long term effects of the vaccine to affect the kids.

2:26:53.220 --> 2:26:56.020
 That's of this new vaccine.

2:26:56.020 --> 2:26:58.620
 Which I would say is, as I said before,

2:26:58.620 --> 2:27:00.620
 you can't say never,

2:27:00.620 --> 2:27:05.620
 but we do know that long COVID exists.

2:27:05.900 --> 2:27:06.860
 We don't know for how long,

2:27:06.860 --> 2:27:09.300
 because we've only looked out six or eight months.

2:27:09.300 --> 2:27:12.380
 We know that exists and the frequency is increasing.

2:27:12.380 --> 2:27:14.260
 It certainly exists in young kids

2:27:14.260 --> 2:27:16.540
 and we have no idea about long vaccine effects.

2:27:16.540 --> 2:27:20.660
 So I think they have to make their decision based on that.

2:27:22.820 --> 2:27:24.420
 But yeah.

2:27:24.420 --> 2:27:28.180
 But your question is why don't we just open up society,

2:27:28.180 --> 2:27:29.580
 say here we have these vaccines

2:27:29.580 --> 2:27:30.780
 if you wanna protect yourself.

2:27:30.780 --> 2:27:32.140
 I think it's mainly the school

2:27:32.140 --> 2:27:35.300
 that's driving the whole narrative, that's my opinion.

2:27:35.300 --> 2:27:37.740
 In which direction, not to open up or?

2:27:37.740 --> 2:27:41.380
 No, to open up, but to try and get their efforts

2:27:41.380 --> 2:27:43.940
 at the federal level to get people vaccinated, right?

2:27:43.940 --> 2:27:45.940
 But see, how high are the risks for kids?

2:27:45.940 --> 2:27:48.060
 I mean, my understanding was it's,

2:27:48.060 --> 2:27:50.500
 I mean, yes, it's nonzero, but it's very low.

2:27:52.220 --> 2:27:53.620
 But what is the numbers?

2:27:53.620 --> 2:27:57.660
 Now, 70,000 hospitalizations so far

2:27:57.660 --> 2:27:59.740
 in kids as of last week.

2:27:59.740 --> 2:28:04.740
 So yes, it's low, but polio was low.

2:28:05.380 --> 2:28:08.740
 Polio was 20, 30,000 kids a year paralyzed.

2:28:08.740 --> 2:28:11.460
 And well, many people have actually argued

2:28:11.460 --> 2:28:13.540
 that that vaccine wasn't necessary.

2:28:13.540 --> 2:28:17.300
 Now, that wasn't a substantial enough health problem.

2:28:17.300 --> 2:28:18.980
 But paralyzed is different than hospital.

2:28:18.980 --> 2:28:20.860
 So what does hospitalized mean?

2:28:20.860 --> 2:28:21.700
 Long COVID.

2:28:21.700 --> 2:28:23.060
 But this is the long COVID question.

2:28:23.060 --> 2:28:24.540
 I mean, this is the open question.

2:28:24.540 --> 2:28:26.420
 It was long COVID in kids.

2:28:26.420 --> 2:28:27.820
 What is that?

2:28:27.820 --> 2:28:30.660
 Well, a lot of the same issues,

2:28:30.660 --> 2:28:34.180
 cognitive issues, motor issues,

2:28:34.180 --> 2:28:37.700
 respiratory, GI dysfunction.

2:28:37.700 --> 2:28:39.300
 How long?

2:28:39.300 --> 2:28:40.140
 We don't know.

2:28:41.100 --> 2:28:43.260
 I mean, it could end in a year.

2:28:43.260 --> 2:28:47.460
 As you know, there are other post acute infectious sequelae

2:28:47.460 --> 2:28:48.660
 that we know about.

2:28:48.660 --> 2:28:51.420
 Chronic fatigue, ME, CFS is thought

2:28:51.420 --> 2:28:53.220
 to be a post infectious sequelae,

2:28:53.220 --> 2:28:55.140
 which has gone for many decades now

2:28:55.140 --> 2:28:56.540
 in many millions of people.

2:28:56.540 --> 2:28:58.740
 This could be another one of those.

2:28:58.740 --> 2:29:02.060
 So I'm just saying it might be worth erring

2:29:02.060 --> 2:29:05.860
 on the side of not letting the kids get infected.

2:29:05.860 --> 2:29:09.860
 Yeah, well, I'm trying to keep an open mind here

2:29:09.860 --> 2:29:12.060
 and I appreciate you doing the same.

2:29:12.060 --> 2:29:17.060
 Of course, I lean on definitely not requiring people

2:29:18.500 --> 2:29:19.340
 to get vaccinated,

2:29:19.340 --> 2:29:21.540
 but I do think getting vaccinated

2:29:21.540 --> 2:29:24.980
 is just the wiser choice,

2:29:24.980 --> 2:29:28.460
 looking at all the different trajectories before us.

2:29:28.460 --> 2:29:33.220
 Getting vaccinated seems like from the data,

2:29:33.220 --> 2:29:35.500
 it seems like the obvious choice, frankly.

2:29:35.500 --> 2:29:38.100
 But I'm also trying to keep an open mind

2:29:38.100 --> 2:29:40.100
 because some things in the past that seemed obvious

2:29:40.100 --> 2:29:42.100
 would turn out to be completely wrong.

2:29:42.100 --> 2:29:44.820
 So I'm trying to keep an open mind here.

2:29:44.820 --> 2:29:48.100
 So for example, one of the things,

2:29:48.100 --> 2:29:52.980
 I'd love to get your thoughts on this is antiviral ideas.

2:29:52.980 --> 2:29:55.020
 So ideas outside of the vaccine.

2:29:56.020 --> 2:30:00.380
 So ivermectin, something that Brett Weinstein

2:30:00.380 --> 2:30:02.100
 and a few others have been talking about.

2:30:02.100 --> 2:30:03.180
 There's been a few studies.

2:30:03.180 --> 2:30:07.100
 Some of them have been shown not to be very good studies,

2:30:07.100 --> 2:30:11.460
 but nevertheless, there seems to be some promise.

2:30:11.460 --> 2:30:14.500
 And I wanted to talk to Brett

2:30:14.500 --> 2:30:17.300
 about this particular topic for two reasons.

2:30:17.300 --> 2:30:19.940
 One, I was really bothered by censorship of this.

2:30:19.940 --> 2:30:22.060
 That's a whole nother topic.

2:30:22.060 --> 2:30:25.940
 I just, I'm bothered by censorship.

2:30:25.940 --> 2:30:27.500
 There's a gray area, of course,

2:30:28.700 --> 2:30:32.180
 but it just feels like that should not have been censored

2:30:32.180 --> 2:30:34.900
 from YouTube, like discussions of ivermectin.

2:30:34.900 --> 2:30:36.740
 We can set that aside.

2:30:36.740 --> 2:30:39.260
 The other thing I was bothered by

2:30:39.260 --> 2:30:42.100
 the lack of open mindedness

2:30:42.100 --> 2:30:46.780
 on exploring things like ivermectin in the early days,

2:30:46.780 --> 2:30:49.140
 especially when at least I thought

2:30:49.140 --> 2:30:51.660
 the vaccine would take a long time.

2:30:51.660 --> 2:30:53.140
 I mean, it's not just ivermectin.

2:30:53.140 --> 2:30:57.500
 It's really seriously at a large scale,

2:30:57.500 --> 2:31:01.340
 rigorously exploring the effectiveness of masks.

2:31:01.340 --> 2:31:03.700
 And the big one for me is testing.

2:31:03.700 --> 2:31:07.020
 Like the fact that that wasn't explored aggressively

2:31:07.020 --> 2:31:11.500
 to lead to mass manufacturing like May, 2020 is absurd.

2:31:11.500 --> 2:31:14.780
 Anyway, so I was bothered by these solutions

2:31:14.780 --> 2:31:16.860
 not being explored and not by now

2:31:16.860 --> 2:31:19.620
 having really good ivermectin studies.

2:31:19.620 --> 2:31:20.980
 Can I talk about ivermectin?

2:31:20.980 --> 2:31:21.820
 Yeah, I would love that, yeah.

2:31:21.820 --> 2:31:23.060
 Sure, so full disclosure,

2:31:23.060 --> 2:31:26.580
 my wife worked on ivermectin at Merck for 20 years.

2:31:26.580 --> 2:31:30.940
 Okay, so they just want people to know,

2:31:30.940 --> 2:31:34.580
 but I don't talk to her all the time about it.

2:31:34.580 --> 2:31:37.220
 And anyway, she hasn't been at Merck for a long time.

2:31:37.220 --> 2:31:39.900
 As you know, ivermectin is a very safe drug

2:31:39.900 --> 2:31:43.580
 used to treat certain parasitic infections, right?

2:31:43.580 --> 2:31:47.300
 And it is approved, it's amazing.

2:31:47.300 --> 2:31:48.660
 You can take one dose a year

2:31:48.660 --> 2:31:51.660
 and be protected against river blindness in Africa

2:31:51.660 --> 2:31:52.700
 and certain parts of Africa.

2:31:52.700 --> 2:31:54.660
 It's remarkably effective.

2:31:54.660 --> 2:31:57.820
 And so it's quite a safe drug

2:31:57.820 --> 2:32:01.260
 at the doses that are approved.

2:32:01.260 --> 2:32:04.500
 Now, early last year, a study was done,

2:32:04.500 --> 2:32:07.380
 I believe in Australia, which showed in cells in the lab,

2:32:07.380 --> 2:32:11.100
 if you infect with SARS CoV2 and then put ivermectin in,

2:32:11.100 --> 2:32:13.860
 it would inhibit the virus production substantially.

2:32:13.860 --> 2:32:16.020
 It was quite clear, right?

2:32:16.020 --> 2:32:19.660
 But the concentrations they were using were rather high

2:32:19.660 --> 2:32:24.660
 and could not be achieved by the approved dosing.

2:32:24.660 --> 2:32:27.860
 So you would need to do a dosing study

2:32:27.860 --> 2:32:28.700
 to make sure it's safe.

2:32:28.700 --> 2:32:32.060
 And the reason is that ivermectin binds to receptors

2:32:32.060 --> 2:32:34.300
 in your brain and it can have high doses.

2:32:34.300 --> 2:32:37.500
 So some people take high doses inappropriately

2:32:37.500 --> 2:32:39.660
 and they have neurological consequences.

2:32:39.660 --> 2:32:42.660
 So if you needed 10 times more ivermectin,

2:32:42.660 --> 2:32:44.980
 you'd have to make sure it would be safe in people.

2:32:44.980 --> 2:32:46.460
 So this is a question of safety too.

2:32:46.460 --> 2:32:51.340
 Right, so I think it has always been the case

2:32:51.340 --> 2:32:54.580
 that it should have been properly studied, but it wasn't.

2:32:54.580 --> 2:32:56.140
 There were lots of trials here and there,

2:32:56.140 --> 2:32:58.700
 lots of improperly controlled trials

2:32:58.700 --> 2:33:00.780
 where someone would just treat some patients

2:33:00.780 --> 2:33:03.780
 and say, hey, they all did fine, but have no control arm.

2:33:03.780 --> 2:33:05.260
 And there were some controlled trials,

2:33:05.260 --> 2:33:06.500
 but they were very small.

2:33:06.500 --> 2:33:11.500
 So right now, a 4,000 person trial is enrolling

2:33:12.660 --> 2:33:16.660
 to test in a randomly controlled trial setting,

2:33:16.660 --> 2:33:17.820
 whether it works or not.

2:33:17.820 --> 2:33:20.340
 There's still plenty of cases that you can do that.

2:33:20.340 --> 2:33:23.060
 So you can ask whether there are any side effects.

2:33:23.060 --> 2:33:25.020
 I think that's completely fine.

2:33:25.020 --> 2:33:28.540
 And if it says it works, then we should use it.

2:33:28.540 --> 2:33:31.340
 In the meantime, I always tell people,

2:33:31.340 --> 2:33:33.820
 if you wanna use ivermectin, you can do it off label.

2:33:33.820 --> 2:33:35.700
 It's FDA approved.

2:33:35.700 --> 2:33:36.780
 And if your physician says,

2:33:36.780 --> 2:33:38.740
 I'm gonna give you this off label,

2:33:38.740 --> 2:33:41.580
 I don't have any objection,

2:33:41.580 --> 2:33:43.780
 but I don't know if it's gonna work.

2:33:43.780 --> 2:33:48.780
 Now, a friend of ours last week in New Jersey got COVID.

2:33:49.260 --> 2:33:50.540
 He went to his local hospital

2:33:50.540 --> 2:33:55.540
 and their regimen was remdesivir, dexamethasone, ivermectin.

2:33:56.580 --> 2:33:59.140
 It's written, that's what they do for every COVID patient.

2:33:59.140 --> 2:34:01.140
 They just give it to them automatically.

2:34:01.140 --> 2:34:04.300
 And so he recovered.

2:34:04.300 --> 2:34:08.320
 So who's to say it was or was not ivermectin, right?

2:34:08.320 --> 2:34:12.820
 So I don't have any strong ideological opposition.

2:34:12.820 --> 2:34:14.620
 I just think it should be tested

2:34:14.620 --> 2:34:16.660
 for what you wanna use it for.

2:34:16.660 --> 2:34:19.260
 And that's being done, and I think that's fine.

2:34:19.260 --> 2:34:23.500
 Is it strange to you that ivermectin

2:34:23.500 --> 2:34:24.780
 or other things like it

2:34:24.780 --> 2:34:27.660
 weren't tested aggressively in the beginning?

2:34:27.660 --> 2:34:32.660
 From a broad scientific community aspect,

2:34:33.940 --> 2:34:35.980
 I can be a little bit conspiratorial,

2:34:35.980 --> 2:34:39.060
 and this is what people talk about with ivermectin,

2:34:39.060 --> 2:34:40.420
 is with the vaccines,

2:34:40.420 --> 2:34:42.700
 there's quite a lot of money to be made.

2:34:42.700 --> 2:34:45.660
 With ivermectin, there's not as much money to be made.

2:34:45.660 --> 2:34:48.380
 Is that too conspiratorial?

2:34:48.380 --> 2:34:51.500
 Like why didn't we try more solutions in the beginning?

2:34:51.500 --> 2:34:55.580
 Well, all the money was put into vaccines, right?

2:34:55.580 --> 2:34:57.340
 Very little was put into antivirals,

2:34:57.340 --> 2:34:59.520
 because the decision was made at a very high level,

2:34:59.520 --> 2:35:01.620
 probably involving Dr. Fauci.

2:35:01.620 --> 2:35:04.760
 We're gonna put 24 billion into vaccines, right?

2:35:06.220 --> 2:35:08.020
 And I think part of the reasoning is

2:35:08.020 --> 2:35:10.100
 they give you years worth of protection,

2:35:10.100 --> 2:35:11.380
 whereas an antiviral works

2:35:11.380 --> 2:35:13.240
 and you have to keep dosing and so forth.

2:35:13.240 --> 2:35:16.000
 But ivermectin is not trivial in this.

2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:18.620
 I agree, it should have been tested early on,

2:35:18.620 --> 2:35:21.820
 but we had a really bad experience with hydroxychloroquine,

2:35:21.820 --> 2:35:23.860
 which we can talk about too.

2:35:25.380 --> 2:35:28.740
 Ivermectin is very hard to synthesize.

2:35:28.740 --> 2:35:31.620
 Most drugs, you synthesize chemically.

2:35:31.620 --> 2:35:34.660
 You devise a formulation and a synthesis,

2:35:34.660 --> 2:35:36.660
 and they do it, they scale it up, and it's fine.

2:35:36.660 --> 2:35:38.340
 Ivermectin is really hard.

2:35:38.340 --> 2:35:41.540
 And so what they do instead is they take the culture

2:35:41.540 --> 2:35:43.820
 of the bacterium that makes it,

2:35:43.820 --> 2:35:45.420
 and they grow it up, and they ferment it,

2:35:45.420 --> 2:35:47.180
 and then they purify it.

2:35:47.180 --> 2:35:50.140
 And Merck owns the bacteria.

2:35:51.380 --> 2:35:55.420
 A number of years ago, two employees of Merck stole it

2:35:55.420 --> 2:35:58.140
 and left the company and tried to market it,

2:35:58.140 --> 2:35:59.980
 and they were arrested and they got put in jail.

2:35:59.980 --> 2:36:02.740
 So they protect it very carefully.

2:36:02.740 --> 2:36:05.580
 So you can't just make it.

2:36:05.580 --> 2:36:07.660
 If you do, it's incredibly expensive.

2:36:07.660 --> 2:36:10.140
 And now India, it's very cheap apparently.

2:36:10.140 --> 2:36:12.540
 They use it quite liberally there,

2:36:12.540 --> 2:36:14.420
 and I don't know how they're making it.

2:36:14.420 --> 2:36:16.660
 Maybe they've licensed it from Merck and so forth.

2:36:16.660 --> 2:36:21.620
 But that's why it hasn't been tested more widely, I think.

2:36:21.620 --> 2:36:24.140
 There's complexities in terms of getting a lot of it

2:36:24.140 --> 2:36:25.420
 and manufacturing a lot of it.

2:36:25.420 --> 2:36:26.420
 Yes. Okay.

2:36:26.420 --> 2:36:28.420
 So what was the hydroxychloroquine?

2:36:28.420 --> 2:36:32.300
 So hydroxychloroquine was also shown early on

2:36:32.300 --> 2:36:34.400
 to inhibit virus in cell culture.

2:36:36.240 --> 2:36:37.340
 And that's not surprising.

2:36:37.340 --> 2:36:41.260
 Hydroxychloroquine, of course, is used for malaria.

2:36:41.260 --> 2:36:46.260
 And what it does, when your cell takes up things

2:36:46.260 --> 2:36:49.620
 from the plasma membrane, including viruses,

2:36:49.620 --> 2:36:52.140
 it goes through a pathway called the endocytic pathway,

2:36:52.140 --> 2:36:54.100
 which involves a vesicle moving through the cell.

2:36:54.100 --> 2:36:57.580
 And as it moves through the cell, its pH drops.

2:36:57.580 --> 2:37:00.180
 And that lets a lot of viruses out actually.

2:37:00.180 --> 2:37:01.820
 And hydroxychloroquine blocks that.

2:37:01.820 --> 2:37:04.120
 So it blocks infection with a lot of viruses.

2:37:06.340 --> 2:37:10.140
 So the problem with those early studies that were published

2:37:10.140 --> 2:37:14.100
 is that they were done in kidney cells and culture,

2:37:14.100 --> 2:37:16.280
 where the only way the virus can get in

2:37:16.280 --> 2:37:17.540
 is through the endosome.

2:37:18.820 --> 2:37:20.940
 And hydroxychloroquine inhibits that,

2:37:20.940 --> 2:37:24.420
 and that's why it inhibits in kidney cells and culture.

2:37:24.420 --> 2:37:28.060
 But lung cells and respiratory cells of humans

2:37:28.060 --> 2:37:31.540
 where the virus reproduces can get in two different ways.

2:37:31.540 --> 2:37:34.680
 It can get in from this endocytic pathway,

2:37:34.680 --> 2:37:37.860
 which is inhibited by hydroxychloroquine,

2:37:37.860 --> 2:37:40.340
 or it can get in at the cell surface,

2:37:40.340 --> 2:37:43.140
 which is not inhibited by hydroxychloroquine.

2:37:43.140 --> 2:37:46.500
 So when you treat patients, it has no effect in the lung

2:37:46.500 --> 2:37:50.160
 because the virus can just bypass it.

2:37:50.160 --> 2:37:54.580
 And all the usage initially were based on

2:37:54.580 --> 2:37:57.220
 the studies done in kidney cells and culture.

2:37:57.220 --> 2:38:00.580
 So that was just wrong, scientifically incorrect,

2:38:00.580 --> 2:38:02.980
 yet it drove a lot of, and today many people

2:38:02.980 --> 2:38:04.980
 still think they should be taking it, but.

2:38:04.980 --> 2:38:09.220
 So that not panning out kind of resulted

2:38:09.220 --> 2:38:14.060
 in a loss of optimism about other similar things panning out.

2:38:14.060 --> 2:38:17.860
 Well, that and many other repurposed drugs were tried,

2:38:17.860 --> 2:38:20.180
 and a lot of HIV antivirals were tried.

2:38:20.180 --> 2:38:23.460
 I think the problem with hydroxychloroquine

2:38:23.460 --> 2:38:26.060
 influenced the ivermectin narrative.

2:38:26.060 --> 2:38:29.340
 People thought that the data was being hidden

2:38:29.340 --> 2:38:30.940
 about hydroxychloroquine, so they said,

2:38:30.940 --> 2:38:33.100
 well, they must be doing the same thing with ivermectin,

2:38:33.100 --> 2:38:36.020
 but with hydroxychloroquine, it just scientifically

2:38:36.020 --> 2:38:39.860
 could not work as an antiviral.

2:38:39.860 --> 2:38:42.080
 The other problem that is more broad

2:38:42.080 --> 2:38:43.980
 that is important to point out is that

2:38:45.820 --> 2:38:49.580
 when you have COVID and you need an antiviral,

2:38:49.580 --> 2:38:50.900
 it's usually because you can't breathe

2:38:50.900 --> 2:38:52.920
 and you go in a hospital.

2:38:52.920 --> 2:38:53.940
 Because if you're mildly ill,

2:38:53.940 --> 2:38:55.340
 you're never gonna go to your doctor

2:38:55.340 --> 2:38:56.820
 and ask for an antiviral.

2:38:56.820 --> 2:38:58.380
 And the problem is when you can't breathe,

2:38:58.380 --> 2:39:00.380
 it's no longer a viral issue.

2:39:00.380 --> 2:39:02.260
 It is now an inflammatory issue,

2:39:02.260 --> 2:39:05.300
 and no antiviral in the world is gonna help you.

2:39:05.300 --> 2:39:08.980
 So that's why remdesivir doesn't work very well,

2:39:08.980 --> 2:39:10.540
 because it's mainly given intravenously

2:39:10.540 --> 2:39:13.100
 to people who go in a hospital.

2:39:13.100 --> 2:39:16.740
 If you get ivermectin in the hospital,

2:39:16.740 --> 2:39:18.980
 it's not gonna do anything for reducing virus,

2:39:18.980 --> 2:39:20.860
 because by that time, you have very little virus

2:39:20.860 --> 2:39:21.780
 to begin with.

2:39:21.780 --> 2:39:23.140
 You have an inflammatory problem

2:39:23.140 --> 2:39:24.860
 that you need to treat in other ways.

2:39:24.860 --> 2:39:28.900
 So this is why a lot of the antivirals failed,

2:39:28.900 --> 2:39:30.860
 because they're used too late.

2:39:30.860 --> 2:39:32.980
 What you need is a pill you take

2:39:32.980 --> 2:39:34.460
 on that first positive test,

2:39:34.460 --> 2:39:36.780
 when you have a scratchy throat.

2:39:36.780 --> 2:39:39.620
 You get a PCR in 15 minutes, I'm positive,

2:39:39.620 --> 2:39:42.740
 take a pill, boom, that's gonna inhibit it.

2:39:42.740 --> 2:39:44.900
 If you wait till you can't breathe,

2:39:44.900 --> 2:39:47.580
 and that's why the monoclonals even don't work

2:39:47.580 --> 2:39:49.140
 if you're in hospital that well,

2:39:49.140 --> 2:39:50.140
 because it's too late.

2:39:50.140 --> 2:39:54.360
 And the approach now is if you're in a high risk group,

2:39:54.360 --> 2:39:58.900
 if you're over 65, if you are obese or have diabetes

2:39:58.900 --> 2:40:00.700
 or any other comorbidities,

2:40:00.700 --> 2:40:03.780
 your first sign of a scratchy throat positive,

2:40:03.780 --> 2:40:07.300
 you get monoclonals, then they might help you.

2:40:07.300 --> 2:40:09.820
 But if you wait till you go in a hospital, it's too late,

2:40:09.820 --> 2:40:12.060
 because the viral curve drops.

2:40:12.060 --> 2:40:15.540
 After that first symptom, within three days,

2:40:15.540 --> 2:40:18.460
 you're no longer shedding enough virus to transmit.

2:40:19.580 --> 2:40:20.700
 Drops really quickly.

2:40:20.700 --> 2:40:23.180
 So that's the reason a lot of these antivirals failed,

2:40:23.180 --> 2:40:25.860
 because they were tested in hospitalized patients.

2:40:25.860 --> 2:40:29.500
 And we have nothing but remdesivir now, unfortunately.

2:40:29.500 --> 2:40:30.940
 So it was the wrong approach.

2:40:30.940 --> 2:40:33.780
 We should have been giving it to people

2:40:33.780 --> 2:40:35.900
 who just tested positive from the start.

2:40:35.900 --> 2:40:38.140
 Or just even for preventative and see.

2:40:38.140 --> 2:40:39.660
 You could do that too.

2:40:39.660 --> 2:40:42.040
 But I have to say, the other issue is,

2:40:42.040 --> 2:40:45.020
 this molnupiravir is a drug in phase three now,

2:40:45.020 --> 2:40:48.420
 it's an oral antiviral, it looks good.

2:40:48.420 --> 2:40:51.140
 If we go ahead with just one,

2:40:51.140 --> 2:40:53.320
 we're gonna get resistance within a few months,

2:40:53.320 --> 2:40:54.360
 and it will be useless.

2:40:54.360 --> 2:40:56.860
 We need to have at least two or three drugs

2:40:56.860 --> 2:40:58.820
 that we can give in combinations.

2:40:58.820 --> 2:41:01.700
 And we know that, because that's what took care of HIV,

2:41:01.700 --> 2:41:05.260
 that's what took care of HCV, hepatitis C virus.

2:41:05.260 --> 2:41:08.120
 It really reduces the emergence of resistance.

2:41:08.980 --> 2:41:11.600
 Joe Rogan got quite a bit of heat recently

2:41:11.600 --> 2:41:16.600
 about mentioning a paper and a broader idea,

2:41:16.620 --> 2:41:19.920
 which I don't think is that controversial,

2:41:19.920 --> 2:41:21.740
 but maybe we can expand on it.

2:41:22.820 --> 2:41:26.180
 And the idea is that vaccines

2:41:26.180 --> 2:41:31.180
 create selective pressure for a virus to mutate

2:41:32.420 --> 2:41:34.300
 and for variants to form.

2:41:37.380 --> 2:41:40.380
 First of all, from a biological perspective,

2:41:40.380 --> 2:41:42.100
 can you explain this process?

2:41:42.100 --> 2:41:45.680
 And from a societal perspective,

2:41:45.680 --> 2:41:47.620
 what are we supposed to do about that?

2:41:47.620 --> 2:41:49.580
 So let's get the terminology right.

2:41:49.580 --> 2:41:51.860
 So as we talked about earlier,

2:41:51.860 --> 2:41:54.060
 viruses are always mutating.

2:41:54.060 --> 2:41:57.660
 So no vaccine or no drug makes a virus mutate.

2:41:57.660 --> 2:41:59.460
 Right, that's the wrong perspective

2:41:59.460 --> 2:42:01.180
 in which to look at it, got it.

2:42:01.180 --> 2:42:04.940
 What the immune response is putting pressure,

2:42:04.940 --> 2:42:07.020
 selection pressure on the virus.

2:42:07.020 --> 2:42:11.500
 And if there's one particle with the right mutation

2:42:11.500 --> 2:42:15.260
 that can escape the antibody, that will emerge, right?

2:42:15.260 --> 2:42:17.700
 So that's what happens with influenza virus, right?

2:42:17.700 --> 2:42:20.220
 We vaccinate every year,

2:42:20.220 --> 2:42:22.160
 and there are not a lot of people that get infected,

2:42:22.160 --> 2:42:24.780
 so they get natural immunity.

2:42:24.780 --> 2:42:28.900
 And then the virus is incredibly varied.

2:42:28.900 --> 2:42:30.260
 It mutates like crazy.

2:42:30.260 --> 2:42:32.120
 And in some person somewhere,

2:42:32.120 --> 2:42:34.380
 there's one variant that escapes the antibody,

2:42:34.380 --> 2:42:37.100
 which has been induced either by infection or vaccination.

2:42:37.100 --> 2:42:37.940
 It can be both.

2:42:38.860 --> 2:42:41.260
 And that drives the emergence of the new variants,

2:42:41.260 --> 2:42:43.860
 so the next year we need to change the vaccine.

2:42:43.860 --> 2:42:48.860
 So I would say both natural infection and vaccination,

2:42:48.960 --> 2:42:51.440
 sure, select for variants.

2:42:51.440 --> 2:42:53.500
 Absolutely, there's no question,

2:42:53.500 --> 2:42:55.420
 because they're inducing immunity.

2:42:55.420 --> 2:43:00.060
 Now, what happened last year was at the beginning of 2020,

2:43:00.060 --> 2:43:02.340
 very few people in the world were immune

2:43:02.340 --> 2:43:04.900
 as the virus first started spreading.

2:43:05.960 --> 2:43:09.140
 But you can see in the sequences of those isolates

2:43:09.140 --> 2:43:11.040
 from the beginning of 2020,

2:43:11.040 --> 2:43:14.660
 you can see all of the changes that are now present

2:43:14.660 --> 2:43:17.700
 in the variants of concern at very, very low frequencies.

2:43:17.700 --> 2:43:18.700
 They were already there,

2:43:18.700 --> 2:43:21.940
 but there was no selection for them to emerge.

2:43:21.940 --> 2:43:25.340
 Until November, when we now had many millions of people

2:43:25.340 --> 2:43:29.780
 who had mostly been infected, but also some vaccinated,

2:43:29.780 --> 2:43:33.060
 then we saw the alpha variant emerge in England,

2:43:33.060 --> 2:43:35.360
 probably because of immune selection.

2:43:35.360 --> 2:43:38.300
 Now, the virus that had the change

2:43:38.300 --> 2:43:41.980
 that evaded the antibody had an advantage,

2:43:41.980 --> 2:43:44.060
 and that virus drove through the population.

2:43:44.060 --> 2:43:45.300
 So that's what we're seeing.

2:43:45.300 --> 2:43:47.980
 All these variants are simply antigenic selection.

2:43:47.980 --> 2:43:50.780
 So the variants, the mutations

2:43:50.780 --> 2:43:55.500
 that are at the core of these, quote unquote, variants,

2:43:55.500 --> 2:43:58.380
 they were always there all along the vaccine,

2:43:58.380 --> 2:44:00.440
 or the infections did not create them.

2:44:00.440 --> 2:44:02.660
 No, the infections don't create them, they're selected.

2:44:02.660 --> 2:44:07.660
 It's like the vaccine wipe out a lot of the variants,

2:44:09.020 --> 2:44:13.740
 and then by making your body immune to them,

2:44:13.740 --> 2:44:15.540
 but some of them survive.

2:44:15.540 --> 2:44:16.820
 Yeah, exactly.

2:44:16.820 --> 2:44:19.500
 And then there's another tree that's built,

2:44:19.500 --> 2:44:22.580
 and it's unclear what that tree leads to.

2:44:23.880 --> 2:44:26.980
 I mean, it could make things much worse or much better,

2:44:26.980 --> 2:44:28.340
 and we don't know.

2:44:28.340 --> 2:44:31.220
 Well, with flu, we see year after year the virus changes,

2:44:31.220 --> 2:44:33.580
 we change the vaccine, we deal with it,

2:44:33.580 --> 2:44:35.540
 we change it again, there's an unending series.

2:44:35.540 --> 2:44:37.260
 But see, that's a very different story.

2:44:37.260 --> 2:44:42.260
 If, do you think COVID will be with some likelihood,

2:44:42.260 --> 2:44:47.260
 like the flu, where it's basically variants,

2:44:47.860 --> 2:44:52.780
 we'll never be able to eradicate it?

2:44:52.780 --> 2:44:57.380
 It will never eradicate it in any case, ever.

2:44:57.380 --> 2:44:59.820
 Well, come up with a vaccine

2:44:59.820 --> 2:45:03.140
 that makes you immune to enough variants

2:45:03.140 --> 2:45:07.240
 where there's not enough evolutionary room.

2:45:07.240 --> 2:45:09.100
 Well, if you cut down the number of infections,

2:45:09.100 --> 2:45:12.180
 then you reduce the diversity, sure, right?

2:45:12.180 --> 2:45:15.140
 The problem is if, let's say you're a cynic

2:45:15.140 --> 2:45:18.100
 and you say, well, vaccination is just selecting

2:45:18.100 --> 2:45:20.020
 for variants, so let's stop it.

2:45:20.020 --> 2:45:21.460
 But then you're gonna have infection,

2:45:21.460 --> 2:45:23.280
 and that's gonna select for variants.

2:45:23.280 --> 2:45:26.260
 And there, you're more likely to get very sick

2:45:26.260 --> 2:45:28.620
 because we know the vaccines are really good

2:45:28.620 --> 2:45:30.060
 at preventing you from dying.

2:45:30.060 --> 2:45:34.060
 So that's why it still makes sense to use vaccines

2:45:34.060 --> 2:45:36.900
 because they prevent you from dying.

2:45:36.900 --> 2:45:38.180
 That's the bottom line.

2:45:38.180 --> 2:45:43.180
 But can we ever make a vaccine that deals with all variants?

2:45:44.560 --> 2:45:45.580
 Absolutely.

2:45:45.580 --> 2:45:49.240
 And the reason I say that is because people

2:45:49.240 --> 2:45:53.420
 who get naturally infected with SARS COVID,

2:45:53.420 --> 2:45:55.120
 they develop COVID, they recover.

2:45:56.860 --> 2:45:59.580
 If you give them one vaccine dose,

2:45:59.580 --> 2:46:01.460
 they make an immune response

2:46:01.460 --> 2:46:05.740
 that handles all the variants that are around right now.

2:46:05.740 --> 2:46:06.580
 All of them.

2:46:06.580 --> 2:46:10.380
 Much better than people who've gotten two doses of vaccine.

2:46:10.380 --> 2:46:14.340
 For some reason, their immune response is suddenly broadened

2:46:14.340 --> 2:46:16.860
 after the infection vaccination,

2:46:16.860 --> 2:46:19.340
 and they can handle all the variants that we know of so far.

2:46:19.340 --> 2:46:22.780
 So that tells me we can devise a strategy

2:46:22.780 --> 2:46:24.540
 to do the same thing with a vaccine

2:46:24.540 --> 2:46:26.620
 that makes a really broad vaccine

2:46:26.620 --> 2:46:27.940
 that'll handle all the variants.

2:46:27.940 --> 2:46:30.660
 Well, you actually, on the virology blog,

2:46:30.660 --> 2:46:32.340
 I don't know if you're the author of that, but.

2:46:32.340 --> 2:46:33.900
 I am, I am, yes.

2:46:33.900 --> 2:46:36.820
 Oh, the blog, yes, but there's a particular post

2:46:36.820 --> 2:46:39.400
 that's talking about reporting on a paper

2:46:39.400 --> 2:46:40.860
 that a mix and match strategy.

2:46:40.860 --> 2:46:44.180
 Oh, yes, that's one of my co writers, Trudy Ray, yeah.

2:46:44.180 --> 2:46:46.620
 Yeah, it's an interesting idea

2:46:46.620 --> 2:46:49.380
 that there's some early evidence now

2:46:49.380 --> 2:46:52.380
 that mixing and matching vaccines,

2:46:52.380 --> 2:46:56.500
 like one shot of Pfizer and one of like Moderna or something,

2:46:56.500 --> 2:47:00.460
 that creates a much better immunity

2:47:00.460 --> 2:47:02.820
 than does two shots of Pfizer.

2:47:02.820 --> 2:47:05.420
 I think that's worth exploring, absolutely.

2:47:05.420 --> 2:47:09.100
 And this is relevant, what we're doing with influenza,

2:47:09.100 --> 2:47:11.240
 you know, instead of having to vaccinate people every year,

2:47:11.240 --> 2:47:12.860
 why can't we devise a vaccine

2:47:12.860 --> 2:47:14.780
 which you'd get once in your lifetime

2:47:14.780 --> 2:47:17.420
 or maybe once every 10 years, okay?

2:47:17.420 --> 2:47:22.420
 So the spike of influenza, it's a long protein,

2:47:22.440 --> 2:47:24.740
 kind of like the spike of SARS CoV2,

2:47:24.740 --> 2:47:26.340
 it's stuck in the virus membrane,

2:47:26.340 --> 2:47:31.340
 and the very tip, that's the part that changes every year.

2:47:31.340 --> 2:47:33.740
 This is where the antibodies bind.

2:47:33.740 --> 2:47:36.480
 But the stem doesn't change.

2:47:37.540 --> 2:47:39.860
 And if you make antibodies to the stem,

2:47:39.860 --> 2:47:41.660
 they can also prevent infection.

2:47:41.660 --> 2:47:44.020
 It's just that when people are infected

2:47:44.020 --> 2:47:45.940
 or with the current vaccines,

2:47:45.940 --> 2:47:48.820
 they don't make many antibodies to that stem part,

2:47:48.820 --> 2:47:51.380
 but we're trying to figure out how to make those

2:47:51.380 --> 2:47:53.620
 and we think they would be broadly protective

2:47:53.620 --> 2:47:55.400
 and you'd never be able to,

2:47:55.400 --> 2:47:59.020
 or more rarely be able to have a variant emerge

2:47:59.020 --> 2:48:00.820
 that escaped it.

2:48:00.820 --> 2:48:02.460
 And I think we can do the same thing

2:48:02.460 --> 2:48:05.500
 with coronavirus too, for sure.

2:48:06.660 --> 2:48:08.380
 Can I ask you about testing?

2:48:08.380 --> 2:48:10.220
 Sure, sure.

2:48:10.220 --> 2:48:13.300
 You mentioned PCR, what kind of tests are there?

2:48:13.300 --> 2:48:18.160
 The antigen test, what are your thoughts on each?

2:48:18.160 --> 2:48:22.460
 Maybe this is a good place to also mention like viral load

2:48:22.460 --> 2:48:27.460
 and the history of the virus as it passes through your body

2:48:27.460 --> 2:48:31.260
 in terms of what's being tested for

2:48:31.260 --> 2:48:33.380
 and all those kinds of things.

2:48:33.380 --> 2:48:38.380
 So the first tests that were developed were PCR,

2:48:39.100 --> 2:48:40.260
 polymerase chain reaction.

2:48:40.260 --> 2:48:43.780
 They're basically nucleic acid amplification tests.

2:48:43.780 --> 2:48:44.820
 And they were very first ones.

2:48:44.820 --> 2:48:47.980
 They stuck the swab all the way up into your brain almost.

2:48:49.260 --> 2:48:50.860
 I had that done a couple of weeks ago.

2:48:50.860 --> 2:48:53.420
 Oh my gosh, it's really nasty.

2:48:53.420 --> 2:48:56.280
 But now they do an anterior Nares swab.

2:48:56.280 --> 2:48:58.940
 They get a little, they get a bunch of cells

2:48:58.940 --> 2:49:02.660
 and some mucus which has virus and parts of virus,

2:49:02.660 --> 2:49:05.980
 stick it in a test tube and then they run a reaction

2:49:05.980 --> 2:49:09.020
 which by the way involves reverse transcriptase

2:49:09.020 --> 2:49:11.980
 because it converts the viral RNA to DNA

2:49:11.980 --> 2:49:14.240
 and then you amplify it.

2:49:14.240 --> 2:49:18.940
 And you can specify what part of the viral RNA

2:49:18.940 --> 2:49:22.540
 you wanna amplify and then a machine will detect it

2:49:22.540 --> 2:49:25.100
 and it can be done in 15 minutes.

2:49:25.100 --> 2:49:29.100
 But you're detecting pieces of RNA, not infectious virus.

2:49:29.100 --> 2:49:32.420
 So we're measuring viral RNA loads, right?

2:49:32.420 --> 2:49:36.060
 And a common mistake that many people

2:49:36.060 --> 2:49:38.700
 who should know better, physicians and scientists

2:49:38.700 --> 2:49:41.180
 of all kinds, they think that indicates

2:49:41.180 --> 2:49:42.640
 how much virus you have.

2:49:43.620 --> 2:49:44.440
 It doesn't.

2:49:45.580 --> 2:49:48.620
 It's a diagnostic of whether you have bits of RNA in you

2:49:48.620 --> 2:49:51.320
 and it probably means you're infected.

2:49:51.320 --> 2:49:55.300
 But you can't use it to shed light on what's going on

2:49:55.300 --> 2:49:56.880
 and I'll tell you why in a bit.

2:49:56.880 --> 2:49:59.520
 But first we have to explain some other things.

2:50:01.940 --> 2:50:06.380
 So until you get to about a million copies of RNA,

2:50:06.380 --> 2:50:08.540
 so you can measure the copy number in this test,

2:50:08.540 --> 2:50:09.700
 this PCR test.

2:50:10.660 --> 2:50:13.860
 It's a number called CT or cycle threshold.

2:50:13.860 --> 2:50:16.420
 The test, the way the machine works, it goes through cycles

2:50:16.420 --> 2:50:19.980
 and every cycle it amplifies what you put in

2:50:19.980 --> 2:50:23.900
 and the more cycles you need to see something,

2:50:23.900 --> 2:50:26.660
 that means there's not a lot of RNA there.

2:50:26.660 --> 2:50:31.100
 So if you do a test and you have a cycle threshold of 35,

2:50:31.100 --> 2:50:33.660
 you have very little RNA in you.

2:50:33.660 --> 2:50:36.160
 Contrary, if you have a cycle threshold of 10,

2:50:36.160 --> 2:50:38.700
 you have a ton of RNA and it only took 10 cycles

2:50:38.700 --> 2:50:39.540
 to detect it.

2:50:40.700 --> 2:50:42.780
 And you can extrapolate from that number,

2:50:42.780 --> 2:50:46.100
 the number of copies you have per sample, say per swab.

2:50:46.100 --> 2:50:49.120
 And if you don't have a million, you're not infectious.

2:50:49.120 --> 2:50:50.740
 You're not gonna infect anyone.

2:50:50.740 --> 2:50:53.300
 So in the early days, no matter what CT,

2:50:53.300 --> 2:50:56.020
 what PCR result you had, they would quarantine you.

2:50:56.020 --> 2:50:58.340
 And that was wrong because you're not shedding.

2:50:58.340 --> 2:51:00.020
 You don't need to be quarantined,

2:51:00.020 --> 2:51:02.740
 but wasn't thought through properly, right?

2:51:02.740 --> 2:51:04.540
 And that's where you had like 14 days

2:51:04.540 --> 2:51:05.380
 or something like that.

2:51:05.380 --> 2:51:07.900
 14 days, which is now we know is too long

2:51:07.900 --> 2:51:11.580
 because you don't shed for that long in a normal infection.

2:51:11.580 --> 2:51:14.120
 Now it's 10 days should be fine.

2:51:14.120 --> 2:51:16.140
 So what happens is you get infected,

2:51:16.140 --> 2:51:17.820
 you don't know it of course.

2:51:17.820 --> 2:51:19.780
 The virus starts to grow very quickly.

2:51:19.780 --> 2:51:21.900
 And within four or five days,

2:51:21.900 --> 2:51:24.660
 you reach a peak of shedding.

2:51:24.660 --> 2:51:28.220
 You're making a lot of RNA and you may be asymptomatic.

2:51:28.220 --> 2:51:30.040
 You're shedding, you can infect others.

2:51:30.040 --> 2:51:32.820
 And then you may or may not have your symptom onset.

2:51:33.940 --> 2:51:36.240
 So you shed for a couple of days before symptom onset.

2:51:36.240 --> 2:51:38.620
 And then within three days, four days,

2:51:38.620 --> 2:51:41.460
 the viral RNA crashes and you're no longer shedding,

2:51:41.460 --> 2:51:42.940
 you're no longer transmitting.

2:51:42.940 --> 2:51:44.540
 So that's the one kind of test we have.

2:51:44.540 --> 2:51:47.640
 It can tell you if you're infected at the moment,

2:51:47.640 --> 2:51:49.020
 but it won't tell you

2:51:49.020 --> 2:51:51.460
 if you're gonna be infected tomorrow, right?

2:51:51.460 --> 2:51:52.660
 Cause if you're negative today,

2:51:52.660 --> 2:51:54.020
 you could be positive tomorrow.

2:51:54.020 --> 2:51:56.140
 You just might be in a different part

2:51:56.140 --> 2:51:58.300
 of the incubation period, right?

2:51:58.300 --> 2:52:01.060
 So that's one test been used the most.

2:52:01.060 --> 2:52:05.020
 You can now get 15 minute versions of them

2:52:05.020 --> 2:52:06.860
 in a walk in or whatever fine.

2:52:06.860 --> 2:52:08.040
 Then there are antigen tests,

2:52:08.040 --> 2:52:11.620
 which look for the proteins that the virus is making.

2:52:11.620 --> 2:52:13.440
 So as it's reproducing in your nose,

2:52:13.440 --> 2:52:16.140
 it's not only making genomes, it's making proteins.

2:52:16.140 --> 2:52:18.340
 And so these you can buy in the drug store.

2:52:18.340 --> 2:52:22.140
 And these would have been great if they had,

2:52:22.140 --> 2:52:24.300
 Michael Minna last year had the idea

2:52:24.300 --> 2:52:26.460
 that if we could make a little stick,

2:52:26.460 --> 2:52:28.580
 a little piece of paper that you would suck on

2:52:28.580 --> 2:52:30.340
 and it would tell you if you're infected or not,

2:52:30.340 --> 2:52:32.540
 if this could cost less than a buck,

2:52:32.540 --> 2:52:33.980
 everybody could test themselves.

2:52:33.980 --> 2:52:37.020
 Which they can cost less than a buck, by the way.

2:52:37.020 --> 2:52:38.820
 Yeah, but they were never made, right?

2:52:38.820 --> 2:52:42.300
 Right, they're never mass manufactured.

2:52:42.300 --> 2:52:44.740
 So his idea is to do like daily tests.

2:52:44.740 --> 2:52:47.340
 Yeah, daily and then the kid's going to school,

2:52:47.340 --> 2:52:49.860
 he's positive or she's positive.

2:52:49.860 --> 2:52:51.820
 Well, if it's cheap enough, you just take another test

2:52:51.820 --> 2:52:53.540
 because they have a certain error frequency.

2:52:53.540 --> 2:52:55.300
 If it's positive twice, you stay home

2:52:55.300 --> 2:52:57.180
 and the next day you try again.

2:52:57.180 --> 2:52:59.860
 And I think this would have revolutionized

2:52:59.860 --> 2:53:02.460
 because the PCR tests are more expensive at the time

2:53:02.460 --> 2:53:05.320
 and they take longer to do and so forth.

2:53:05.320 --> 2:53:07.060
 But that never happened.

2:53:07.060 --> 2:53:09.500
 But now we do have $20 Binax now

2:53:09.500 --> 2:53:12.420
 and others that you can buy and people buy them.

2:53:12.420 --> 2:53:13.980
 But that can still happen, right?

2:53:13.980 --> 2:53:16.020
 And this is the very frustrating thing to me

2:53:16.020 --> 2:53:18.980
 because I'm worried about variants,

2:53:18.980 --> 2:53:20.660
 but I'm also worried about future,

2:53:20.660 --> 2:53:23.600
 much more deadly pandemics.

2:53:23.600 --> 2:53:28.460
 Like I know we kind of said, yes, COVID, lots of deaths,

2:53:28.460 --> 2:53:31.380
 but like it could be a lot worse too.

2:53:31.380 --> 2:53:35.780
 And so I'm thinking what is going to be the right response

2:53:35.780 --> 2:53:38.580
 for the future pandemic of its kind?

2:53:38.580 --> 2:53:39.900
 And what's the right response

2:53:39.900 --> 2:53:41.640
 for continued number of variants

2:53:41.640 --> 2:53:44.620
 and some of the variants might be deadlier

2:53:44.620 --> 2:53:45.940
 or more transmissible?

2:53:45.940 --> 2:53:49.980
 Well, we can, the antigen tests

2:53:49.980 --> 2:53:51.860
 will pick up the variants.

2:53:51.860 --> 2:53:52.700
 That's not a question.

2:53:52.700 --> 2:53:55.100
 The PCR may be influenced by changes,

2:53:55.100 --> 2:53:58.500
 but you can quickly adapt the primers that you use.

2:53:58.500 --> 2:53:59.340
 So that's what I mean.

2:53:59.340 --> 2:54:00.980
 Like to me, all of these discussions

2:54:00.980 --> 2:54:03.300
 about vaccines and so on.

2:54:03.300 --> 2:54:06.800
 Vaccines, we got very lucky that they took so little time.

2:54:08.060 --> 2:54:10.540
 And you have to be aware no matter what

2:54:10.540 --> 2:54:12.340
 that there's hesitancy with the vaccines

2:54:12.340 --> 2:54:13.780
 in this country before.

2:54:13.780 --> 2:54:15.700
 I mean, yeah, that's a reality.

2:54:15.700 --> 2:54:17.580
 You can't just be like magically saying

2:54:17.580 --> 2:54:20.420
 that you're going to overcome that.

2:54:20.420 --> 2:54:22.200
 And I don't think there's any hesitancy

2:54:22.200 --> 2:54:24.040
 and cheap tests at home.

2:54:24.040 --> 2:54:24.880
 I agree.

2:54:24.880 --> 2:54:27.020
 I think if someone, so the question is

2:54:27.020 --> 2:54:29.220
 if someone tested positive, would they stay home?

2:54:29.220 --> 2:54:30.060
 That's the question.

2:54:30.060 --> 2:54:32.380
 What if their job depends on them going in?

2:54:32.380 --> 2:54:33.580
 I mean, that's.

2:54:33.580 --> 2:54:36.660
 Well, you have to look at sort of aggregate,

2:54:36.660 --> 2:54:38.180
 how many people would decide.

2:54:38.180 --> 2:54:43.060
 And I think, again, a lot of that is in leadership,

2:54:43.060 --> 2:54:45.060
 but I think a lot of them,

2:54:45.060 --> 2:54:47.140
 I would say most people would stay home.

2:54:47.140 --> 2:54:49.460
 I think that Mina had the idea

2:54:49.460 --> 2:54:53.180
 and it would have changed the whole situation for sure.

2:54:53.180 --> 2:54:56.220
 If it could have been made when we talked to him last spring,

2:54:56.220 --> 2:54:59.900
 I think, or summer, we would have gotten around

2:54:59.900 --> 2:55:01.540
 a lot of the issues that we're in today

2:55:01.540 --> 2:55:03.060
 because I think people would have stayed home

2:55:03.060 --> 2:55:04.000
 and not transmitted.

2:55:04.000 --> 2:55:06.060
 And I think it's still valuable to this day.

2:55:06.060 --> 2:55:09.820
 In the fall, if we don't have vaccine uptake,

2:55:09.820 --> 2:55:12.380
 we could just test kids every day

2:55:12.380 --> 2:55:14.240
 and keep them home when they're infected.

2:55:14.240 --> 2:55:17.580
 It cuts, and we don't have it.

2:55:17.580 --> 2:55:20.620
 But I think, and I'm not privy to what was going on,

2:55:20.620 --> 2:55:22.980
 but I don't think a lot of emphasis

2:55:22.980 --> 2:55:25.100
 was put on testing early on.

2:55:25.100 --> 2:55:27.940
 The CDC developed the first one, it was flawed.

2:55:27.940 --> 2:55:29.380
 They had to recall the kits.

2:55:29.380 --> 2:55:30.380
 I mean, that's a fiasco.

2:55:30.380 --> 2:55:32.200
 They should have had 100 companies

2:55:32.200 --> 2:55:34.700
 making the tests initially, right?

2:55:34.700 --> 2:55:37.960
 So for the future, I think what we have learned

2:55:37.960 --> 2:55:42.280
 is we need to have a rapid antigen test right off the bat.

2:55:42.280 --> 2:55:43.700
 It's doable.

2:55:43.700 --> 2:55:46.220
 You can't do it in a day like you can for PCR

2:55:46.220 --> 2:55:49.700
 because you need to make antibodies

2:55:49.700 --> 2:55:51.180
 to the protein that you're looking for

2:55:51.180 --> 2:55:52.920
 and you need to do those in animals.

2:55:52.920 --> 2:55:57.660
 But you can do it in weeks and we should be ready for that.

2:55:57.660 --> 2:56:00.680
 Yeah, because I mean, to me, that's obvious.

2:56:00.680 --> 2:56:02.820
 That's obviously the best solution.

2:56:02.820 --> 2:56:06.860
 Second to that, if we understood how well masks work.

2:56:08.500 --> 2:56:11.300
 Like, maybe let me ask you this question.

2:56:11.300 --> 2:56:13.020
 Let's put masks aside.

2:56:14.040 --> 2:56:18.100
 How well do we understand how COVID is transmitted?

2:56:18.100 --> 2:56:21.000
 There's droplets of different sizes,

2:56:22.140 --> 2:56:24.820
 aerosols, tiny, tiny droplets.

2:56:26.500 --> 2:56:28.480
 It seems like that's a very difficult thing

2:56:28.480 --> 2:56:29.840
 to understand thoroughly.

2:56:29.840 --> 2:56:33.320
 So it seems like it's transmitted both ways.

2:56:33.320 --> 2:56:35.640
 It's unclear how exactly.

2:56:35.640 --> 2:56:38.480
 So how much do we understand

2:56:38.480 --> 2:56:40.680
 and why is it so difficult to understand fully?

2:56:40.680 --> 2:56:43.080
 Well, I think it's clear that it's transmitted

2:56:43.080 --> 2:56:44.760
 through the air mostly.

2:56:44.760 --> 2:56:46.240
 It's not touching.

2:56:46.240 --> 2:56:47.920
 We thought initially it would be a lot of touch,

2:56:47.920 --> 2:56:50.040
 but very little of that.

2:56:50.040 --> 2:56:53.120
 It's through the air and when you talk,

2:56:53.120 --> 2:56:56.640
 mainly when you talk, you expel a lot of droplets, right?

2:56:56.640 --> 2:56:59.240
 Even the plosives that your foam thing here

2:56:59.240 --> 2:57:01.560
 are meant to pee, right?

2:57:01.560 --> 2:57:03.040
 That you send out little sprays

2:57:03.040 --> 2:57:04.640
 and those have viruses in them.

2:57:05.520 --> 2:57:07.320
 And the big drops fall to the ground

2:57:08.200 --> 2:57:11.280
 and the little ones can go 100 feet or more, right?

2:57:11.280 --> 2:57:14.120
 But the little ones also have less virus in them.

2:57:15.720 --> 2:57:18.720
 So I'm not sure, well, we certainly do not know

2:57:18.720 --> 2:57:21.360
 how much virus you need to be infected.

2:57:21.360 --> 2:57:24.920
 But it's probably at least several thousand particles,

2:57:24.920 --> 2:57:26.160
 if not more.

2:57:26.160 --> 2:57:29.480
 And it could be that for most people,

2:57:30.320 --> 2:57:32.720
 the tiny droplets don't have enough virus

2:57:32.720 --> 2:57:34.200
 to infect someone else.

2:57:34.200 --> 2:57:37.080
 But there's one observation about this virus

2:57:37.080 --> 2:57:38.640
 that's really interesting.

2:57:38.640 --> 2:57:42.080
 And that is that 80% of transmissions

2:57:42.080 --> 2:57:46.360
 are done by 20% of the people, of the infected people.

2:57:46.360 --> 2:57:49.840
 Not every infected person transmits.

2:57:49.840 --> 2:57:51.920
 That's been borne out in multiple studies.

2:57:51.920 --> 2:57:55.520
 And in fact, there's a study at University of Colorado

2:57:55.520 --> 2:57:58.720
 where they quantified the viral RNA loads

2:57:58.720 --> 2:58:01.320
 in all the swabs that had been done of students

2:58:01.320 --> 2:58:03.760
 for like a six month period.

2:58:03.760 --> 2:58:07.880
 And most of the infectious virus,

2:58:07.880 --> 2:58:10.680
 most of the RNA copies were found

2:58:10.680 --> 2:58:14.600
 in 15 to 20% of the people.

2:58:14.600 --> 2:58:15.760
 The rest had really low

2:58:15.760 --> 2:58:18.320
 and that's probably why they don't transmit.

2:58:18.320 --> 2:58:22.320
 So those are the ones that might get enough virus

2:58:22.320 --> 2:58:24.840
 in the tiny droplets to be able to infect

2:58:24.840 --> 2:58:26.520
 someone at a distance.

2:58:26.520 --> 2:58:28.840
 And I think that's entirely possible.

2:58:28.840 --> 2:58:31.040
 Why is it hard to study?

2:58:31.040 --> 2:58:32.800
 You can't do it in real life

2:58:32.800 --> 2:58:35.360
 because you don't know who's infected.

2:58:35.360 --> 2:58:37.800
 And if you do, there's not a controlled environment

2:58:37.800 --> 2:58:39.240
 to measure droplets and so forth.

2:58:39.240 --> 2:58:42.280
 You'd have to do it in a laboratory situation.

2:58:42.280 --> 2:58:44.160
 If you use an animal, you just don't know

2:58:44.160 --> 2:58:46.520
 what the relevance of that is to people.

2:58:46.520 --> 2:58:50.000
 You'd have to use human and do challenge experiments.

2:58:50.000 --> 2:58:51.880
 And we don't do that at this point,

2:58:51.880 --> 2:58:53.320
 at least not for this virus.

2:58:53.320 --> 2:58:55.920
 So that's why it's hard to know what's going on.

2:58:55.920 --> 2:58:58.240
 So we have to make inferences

2:58:58.240 --> 2:59:01.240
 from epidemiological associations

2:59:01.240 --> 2:59:03.840
 where you're studying, say transmission in a household

2:59:03.840 --> 2:59:06.080
 where people are stuck in the same rooms together

2:59:06.080 --> 2:59:09.160
 and you can get an idea of what kind of droplets

2:59:09.160 --> 2:59:10.000
 were involved.

2:59:10.000 --> 2:59:11.320
 So that makes it much harder too.

2:59:11.320 --> 2:59:14.160
 If you're leaning on epidemiological stuff

2:59:14.160 --> 2:59:15.680
 as opposed to like biophysics

2:59:15.680 --> 2:59:17.280
 or something like the mechanic.

2:59:17.280 --> 2:59:18.320
 Very hard.

2:59:18.320 --> 2:59:23.120
 So that makes it really hard to then develop solutions

2:59:23.120 --> 2:59:26.600
 like masks, to ask the question, how well do masks work?

2:59:26.600 --> 2:59:28.800
 Because then to answer that question,

2:59:28.800 --> 2:59:32.280
 you can lean on epidemiological stuff again,

2:59:32.280 --> 2:59:34.520
 like looking at populations that wear masks

2:59:34.520 --> 2:59:36.560
 versus don't wear masks.

2:59:36.560 --> 2:59:38.840
 As opposed to actually saying,

2:59:40.320 --> 2:59:41.840
 like from an engineering perspective,

2:59:41.840 --> 2:59:46.600
 like what kind of material and what kind of tightness

2:59:46.600 --> 2:59:50.440
 by which amount decreases the viral load

2:59:50.440 --> 2:59:52.480
 that's received on the other end.

2:59:52.480 --> 2:59:55.800
 But some experiments have been done with masks

2:59:55.800 --> 2:59:58.680
 and just droplets with no virus in them, right?

2:59:58.680 --> 3:00:01.360
 And you can measure the efficiency

3:00:01.360 --> 3:00:04.400
 of different mask materials at keeping those in.

3:00:04.400 --> 3:00:09.400
 So if I say that this mask stops 70%

3:00:09.880 --> 3:00:13.760
 of this or larger size droplet,

3:00:13.760 --> 3:00:18.000
 that leads to this percent decreased transmission.

3:00:18.000 --> 3:00:23.000
 And also on both the generation

3:00:23.040 --> 3:00:27.520
 and the receiving end and the giving end.

3:00:27.520 --> 3:00:28.360
 Sure.

3:00:28.360 --> 3:00:30.560
 So how well do masks protect you from others?

3:00:30.560 --> 3:00:34.200
 How well do you do mask protect others from you?

3:00:34.200 --> 3:00:36.920
 Like all of those things seem like

3:00:36.920 --> 3:00:40.120
 they could be more rigorously studied.

3:00:40.120 --> 3:00:41.560
 There's no doubt about it.

3:00:41.560 --> 3:00:46.120
 And now is the time because once this is over,

3:00:46.120 --> 3:00:47.200
 nobody's gonna do it.

3:00:47.200 --> 3:00:48.360
 Nobody's gonna care.

3:00:48.360 --> 3:00:49.200
 No. Right.

3:00:49.200 --> 3:00:52.880
 But it seems like to me, so tests is one thing,

3:00:52.880 --> 3:00:57.480
 but masks, like the good mask,

3:00:57.480 --> 3:00:59.960
 whatever the good means, whatever that means,

3:00:59.960 --> 3:01:04.200
 like some level of quality of material on your face,

3:01:04.200 --> 3:01:08.960
 if it's shown to actually like thoroughly shown to work well,

3:01:08.960 --> 3:01:10.960
 that seems like an obvious solution

3:01:12.120 --> 3:01:14.840
 to reopen society with.

3:01:14.840 --> 3:01:17.920
 If you have a good understanding of how well they work.

3:01:17.920 --> 3:01:20.040
 Because if you don't have a good understanding,

3:01:20.040 --> 3:01:21.800
 if there's a lot of uncertainty,

3:01:21.800 --> 3:01:23.000
 that's when you get,

3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:24.960
 and you have people speaking from authority,

3:01:24.960 --> 3:01:27.960
 that's when you start getting the politicization

3:01:27.960 --> 3:01:28.800
 of the solution.

3:01:28.800 --> 3:01:29.640
 Of course, of course.

3:01:29.640 --> 3:01:32.160
 No, the data, there are some data,

3:01:33.200 --> 3:01:36.320
 most, they're mostly epidemiological

3:01:36.320 --> 3:01:39.120
 and they show some effect in some countries, right?

3:01:39.120 --> 3:01:40.800
 But they could be way better.

3:01:40.800 --> 3:01:41.640
 Yeah.

3:01:41.640 --> 3:01:44.920
 And, but the fact that they're not perfect,

3:01:44.920 --> 3:01:46.800
 then people take advantage of and say,

3:01:46.800 --> 3:01:48.120
 well, look, they don't work that well,

3:01:48.120 --> 3:01:49.120
 so I'm not gonna wear it.

3:01:49.120 --> 3:01:53.040
 I think, as you said, people can use it as an excuse.

3:01:53.040 --> 3:01:56.200
 But even if it works, so Daniel always says,

3:01:56.200 --> 3:02:00.680
 a mask will cut down transmission by 50 to 60%,

3:02:00.680 --> 3:02:03.480
 and then distance will do another 30%.

3:02:03.480 --> 3:02:05.800
 Yeah, those numbers are made up though.

3:02:05.800 --> 3:02:08.360
 I mean, they're not made up, but they're estimates.

3:02:08.360 --> 3:02:09.200
 Absolutely.

3:02:09.200 --> 3:02:12.720
 And many of them are made based on models, right?

3:02:12.720 --> 3:02:13.560
 Yeah.

3:02:13.560 --> 3:02:14.400
 We make this model,

3:02:14.400 --> 3:02:16.480
 and let's say the mask cuts down this much,

3:02:16.480 --> 3:02:17.920
 what will be the effect on it?

3:02:17.920 --> 3:02:19.000
 I mean, yeah, they're models,

3:02:19.000 --> 3:02:20.760
 and it's for the same reason.

3:02:20.760 --> 3:02:25.000
 I don't believe the transmission of the variants

3:02:25.000 --> 3:02:27.280
 because it's all based on statistical models as well,

3:02:27.280 --> 3:02:29.520
 not biological experiments done in a lab.

3:02:29.520 --> 3:02:32.000
 So in that sense, vaccine data is much better

3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:33.200
 than mask data.

3:02:33.200 --> 3:02:34.480
 For sure, for sure.

3:02:34.480 --> 3:02:37.160
 So my problem with the mask data,

3:02:37.160 --> 3:02:38.440
 which I always thought was fascinating,

3:02:38.440 --> 3:02:39.600
 I stopped talking about it.

3:02:39.600 --> 3:02:41.400
 I was in a paper about masks.

3:02:41.400 --> 3:02:42.400
 I stopped talking about it

3:02:42.400 --> 3:02:45.080
 because what started happening

3:02:45.080 --> 3:02:48.000
 is masks created assholes on both sides.

3:02:48.000 --> 3:02:50.400
 The people that were like in Silicon Valley,

3:02:50.400 --> 3:02:52.520
 the friends of mine that were wearing masks,

3:02:52.520 --> 3:02:56.160
 the way they look at others who don't is like...

3:02:56.160 --> 3:02:58.240
 Well, that's a whole nother issue, right?

3:02:58.240 --> 3:02:59.880
 Yeah, I understand.

3:02:59.880 --> 3:03:02.560
 That happens when you don't have solid science.

3:03:02.560 --> 3:03:03.400
 Understood.

3:03:03.400 --> 3:03:07.240
 They now start judging you like you're a lesser human being.

3:03:07.240 --> 3:03:11.520
 You're not only dumb, but you're almost like evil.

3:03:11.520 --> 3:03:14.280
 You're doing bad for society by not wearing a mask.

3:03:14.280 --> 3:03:17.120
 And then the people looking in the other way

3:03:17.120 --> 3:03:19.800
 are seeing you for the asshole that you're being

3:03:19.800 --> 3:03:22.040
 for judging them unrightly.

3:03:22.040 --> 3:03:24.480
 So they almost wanna say F you by not wearing the mask.

3:03:24.480 --> 3:03:26.640
 And there's this division that's created

3:03:26.640 --> 3:03:30.400
 that was heartbreaking to me because masks like testing

3:03:30.400 --> 3:03:33.400
 is a solution that was available early on.

3:03:33.400 --> 3:03:35.920
 And if understood well, it could be deployed

3:03:35.920 --> 3:03:37.880
 in a mass scale, and it seems like there's

3:03:37.880 --> 3:03:40.120
 some historical evidence for other viruses

3:03:40.120 --> 3:03:41.760
 where it does very well.

3:03:41.760 --> 3:03:42.600
 That's correct.

3:03:42.600 --> 3:03:45.720
 And so like the fact that this was politicized,

3:03:47.200 --> 3:03:48.760
 yeah, it was a little bit heartbreaking.

3:03:48.760 --> 3:03:51.800
 You can find in the literature studies,

3:03:51.800 --> 3:03:54.560
 mostly of healthcare workers and influenza,

3:03:54.560 --> 3:03:56.240
 where you can actually,

3:03:56.240 --> 3:03:58.440
 because you see the people every day that can sample them,

3:03:58.440 --> 3:04:00.520
 you can actually see what masking does.

3:04:00.520 --> 3:04:04.040
 And some of them show an effect and others do not,

3:04:04.040 --> 3:04:05.600
 then that's the problem.

3:04:05.600 --> 3:04:08.280
 Like any trial, sometimes if it's not big enough

3:04:08.280 --> 3:04:10.360
 and then people latch onto that, see,

3:04:10.360 --> 3:04:11.600
 it doesn't really work.

3:04:11.600 --> 3:04:15.000
 But I think the main issue is that in January,

3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:20.000
 both CDC and WHO said masks don't work, don't use them.

3:04:20.000 --> 3:04:22.240
 That was the kiss of death for masks

3:04:22.240 --> 3:04:25.080
 because when they then changed their mind,

3:04:25.920 --> 3:04:28.040
 they didn't say we screwed up.

3:04:28.040 --> 3:04:29.240
 They just said wear masks.

3:04:29.240 --> 3:04:33.000
 If they had said we made a mistake, we were wrong,

3:04:33.000 --> 3:04:35.400
 I think more people would have worn masks.

3:04:35.400 --> 3:04:36.600
 But they didn't.

3:04:36.600 --> 3:04:39.080
 And like you said, admitting you're wrong

3:04:39.080 --> 3:04:41.440
 is like a real big part of it.

3:04:41.440 --> 3:04:43.200
 And I also think almost the better way

3:04:43.200 --> 3:04:46.560
 is not just saying you're wrong,

3:04:46.560 --> 3:04:49.760
 but in January saying,

3:04:49.760 --> 3:04:52.360
 like revealing the uncertainty under which we operate.

3:04:52.360 --> 3:04:56.440
 Like actually, like reveal what was done

3:04:56.440 --> 3:04:58.360
 with the Spanish flu at the beginning

3:04:58.360 --> 3:04:59.680
 of the previous century,

3:05:01.080 --> 3:05:03.240
 because there's a lot of mass controversy then too.

3:05:03.240 --> 3:05:04.120
 It went back and forth.

3:05:04.120 --> 3:05:05.960
 And that was actually the source of a lot of distrust

3:05:05.960 --> 3:05:06.920
 there too.

3:05:06.920 --> 3:05:09.280
 So, and then look at influenza,

3:05:09.280 --> 3:05:11.080
 like how is it effective with that?

3:05:11.080 --> 3:05:13.880
 And just reveal this, we don't know,

3:05:13.880 --> 3:05:17.680
 but like with some probability,

3:05:17.680 --> 3:05:20.120
 this is the best option we got currently.

3:05:20.120 --> 3:05:23.600
 And then in a month or two, adjust it,

3:05:23.600 --> 3:05:25.280
 saying that, you know what,

3:05:25.280 --> 3:05:27.840
 our like uncertainty decreased a little bit.

3:05:27.840 --> 3:05:29.440
 We have a better idea.

3:05:29.440 --> 3:05:32.320
 Like that was an incorrect estimate,

3:05:32.320 --> 3:05:34.840
 but reveal that you're struggling.

3:05:34.840 --> 3:05:36.840
 It's not like this weird binary clock

3:05:36.840 --> 3:05:38.440
 that goes one direction or the other.

3:05:38.440 --> 3:05:41.200
 You're struggling with uncertainty.

3:05:41.200 --> 3:05:42.400
 And like trusting,

3:05:43.240 --> 3:05:45.040
 people maybe criticize me sometimes for this,

3:05:45.040 --> 3:05:48.000
 but I think most people are actually intelligent.

3:05:48.960 --> 3:05:51.760
 Like trusting the public to be intelligent

3:05:51.760 --> 3:05:54.040
 with if you give them, if you have transparent

3:05:54.040 --> 3:05:57.680
 and give them information in a real authentic way,

3:05:57.680 --> 3:05:59.560
 like don't look like you're hiding something.

3:05:59.560 --> 3:06:01.920
 I think they're intelligent enough to use that data

3:06:01.920 --> 3:06:03.120
 to make decisions.

3:06:03.120 --> 3:06:05.080
 It's the same thing as with the testing,

3:06:05.080 --> 3:06:07.600
 is if you put that power in the people's hands

3:06:07.600 --> 3:06:08.640
 to know if they're sick or not,

3:06:08.640 --> 3:06:12.240
 they're gonna make unmasked the right decision, I think.

3:06:14.240 --> 3:06:17.080
 The masks and the testing has been a bit heartbreaking.

3:06:18.000 --> 3:06:19.440
 I think that's a good point though,

3:06:19.440 --> 3:06:21.640
 that most people don't seem to have an objection

3:06:21.640 --> 3:06:23.040
 to testing.

3:06:23.040 --> 3:06:23.880
 It's a good point.

3:06:23.880 --> 3:06:24.720
 Yes. Yeah.

3:06:24.720 --> 3:06:27.960
 And then obviously Macamina makes that point brilliantly.

3:06:27.960 --> 3:06:32.080
 And still there's very little excitement around that.

3:06:33.320 --> 3:06:35.000
 But he said he was going to do it.

3:06:35.000 --> 3:06:35.840
 I don't understand.

3:06:35.840 --> 3:06:37.600
 I mean, I haven't spoken to him since then.

3:06:37.600 --> 3:06:38.720
 So I don't know why.

3:06:38.720 --> 3:06:39.560
 He's pushing it.

3:06:39.560 --> 3:06:41.640
 Well, I mean, but he can't do it alone.

3:06:41.640 --> 3:06:44.680
 He has to get, so one of the resistances,

3:06:44.680 --> 3:06:48.160
 FDA doesn't like cheap things.

3:06:48.160 --> 3:06:49.120
 Yeah.

3:06:49.120 --> 3:06:50.240
 They don't wanna approve it.

3:06:50.240 --> 3:06:52.960
 So they makes the mass manufacture

3:06:52.960 --> 3:06:55.120
 like with the emergency exceptions,

3:06:55.120 --> 3:06:57.440
 all those kinds of things very difficult.

3:06:57.440 --> 3:06:59.560
 And then there's not much money to be made on it

3:06:59.560 --> 3:07:00.760
 without that.

3:07:00.760 --> 3:07:01.600
 I don't know.

3:07:01.600 --> 3:07:04.840
 I think there's just economic pressures against it.

3:07:04.840 --> 3:07:09.840
 And because so much investment was placed on the vaccines

3:07:10.920 --> 3:07:13.360
 and obviously there's an incentive mechanism there

3:07:13.360 --> 3:07:16.120
 where the companies, lobbyists and all those,

3:07:17.200 --> 3:07:21.440
 there's this machine that says arguing for tests

3:07:21.440 --> 3:07:23.240
 is difficult because the thing that's worked

3:07:23.240 --> 3:07:27.160
 for most severe viruses in the past is vaccines.

3:07:27.160 --> 3:07:28.320
 Now we have vaccines.

3:07:28.320 --> 3:07:30.360
 Why the hell would you need tests?

3:07:30.360 --> 3:07:34.440
 At that time, like why the hell do you need tests

3:07:34.440 --> 3:07:36.080
 when we can be working on vaccines?

3:07:36.080 --> 3:07:37.720
 It seems like the obvious thing to be working

3:07:37.720 --> 3:07:40.680
 is the vaccines from their perspective,

3:07:40.680 --> 3:07:43.160
 but it's not obvious at all to me.

3:07:43.160 --> 3:07:44.440
 I think you should have both.

3:07:44.440 --> 3:07:46.600
 I think have vaccines and good testing

3:07:46.600 --> 3:07:48.920
 and that covers you really well

3:07:48.920 --> 3:07:50.080
 because you're always gonna have people

3:07:50.080 --> 3:07:52.080
 who don't get vaccinated.

3:07:52.080 --> 3:07:54.200
 I don't know if you've been paying attention to this.

3:07:54.200 --> 3:07:55.720
 There's a guy named Brett Weinstein.

3:07:55.720 --> 3:07:57.760
 There's a guy named Sam Harris.

3:07:57.760 --> 3:07:59.560
 They have good representation.

3:08:00.760 --> 3:08:05.760
 I would say of two sides of a perspective on the vaccine.

3:08:06.240 --> 3:08:09.680
 So from Sam Harris's perspective,

3:08:09.680 --> 3:08:13.240
 it's obvious that everybody should get vaccinated

3:08:13.240 --> 3:08:18.240
 and it's irresponsible to not get vaccinated.

3:08:18.560 --> 3:08:22.360
 I think he represents a lot of people's belief in that.

3:08:22.360 --> 3:08:27.360
 And then Brett talks a lot about ivermectin,

3:08:28.520 --> 3:08:32.720
 but also talks about hesitancy towards the vaccine

3:08:32.720 --> 3:08:35.040
 for people who are healthy,

3:08:35.040 --> 3:08:37.520
 for people who are younger, that kind of thing,

3:08:38.480 --> 3:08:40.840
 and saying we should consider longterm effects

3:08:40.840 --> 3:08:45.200
 of the vaccine in making this calculation.

3:08:45.200 --> 3:08:47.520
 What do you make about this conversation?

3:08:47.520 --> 3:08:49.400
 Some of it happens on Twitter.

3:08:49.400 --> 3:08:52.480
 Some of it happens in the space of podcasts.

3:08:54.000 --> 3:08:56.240
 Do you pay attention to this kind of thing?

3:08:56.240 --> 3:08:58.240
 What's your role in this?

3:08:58.240 --> 3:09:02.080
 What do you hope is the way to resolve this conversation?

3:09:02.080 --> 3:09:04.040
 Do you think it's healthy?

3:09:04.040 --> 3:09:05.760
 Well, a conversation is always healthy,

3:09:05.760 --> 3:09:09.280
 but to make definitive statements is not

3:09:09.280 --> 3:09:12.200
 because it suggests you have information that you don't have.

3:09:12.200 --> 3:09:16.880
 So we talked about longterm effects.

3:09:16.880 --> 3:09:20.360
 I think you need to balance those versus longterm effects

3:09:20.360 --> 3:09:22.520
 of the disease and you can make your decision.

3:09:22.520 --> 3:09:26.560
 I don't think you need to tell everybody to get vaccinated.

3:09:26.560 --> 3:09:28.760
 I think you need to present the case.

3:09:28.760 --> 3:09:30.400
 You say, here, we made good vaccines.

3:09:30.400 --> 3:09:32.240
 Here are the safety profile.

3:09:32.240 --> 3:09:34.400
 Here's the risk benefit balance.

3:09:34.400 --> 3:09:35.280
 And you should decide.

3:09:35.280 --> 3:09:36.160
 You're a smart person.

3:09:36.160 --> 3:09:37.880
 You should decide.

3:09:37.880 --> 3:09:41.240
 Now, companies are gonna do differently, right?

3:09:41.240 --> 3:09:43.320
 Companies may say you have to be vaccinated to work here.

3:09:43.320 --> 3:09:46.720
 My employer, Columbia, said we have to be vaccinated

3:09:46.720 --> 3:09:47.560
 to work in the fall.

3:09:47.560 --> 3:09:49.440
 And if you wanna be a student, you have to be vaccinated.

3:09:49.440 --> 3:09:52.240
 So you decide whether you wanna go or not.

3:09:52.240 --> 3:09:57.240
 But the idea that you should make a decision

3:09:58.000 --> 3:10:02.480
 based on longterm effects, there is no evidence, right?

3:10:02.480 --> 3:10:03.760
 So how can you make a decision

3:10:03.760 --> 3:10:05.200
 when we don't have evidence,

3:10:05.200 --> 3:10:06.280
 whereas we do have evidence

3:10:06.280 --> 3:10:08.440
 that there are longterm effects of getting COVID?

3:10:08.440 --> 3:10:10.200
 So I don't think that's a fair argument

3:10:10.200 --> 3:10:13.640
 and it just makes people scared to say that.

3:10:13.640 --> 3:10:15.000
 But on the other hand, for someone to say

3:10:15.000 --> 3:10:18.280
 it's a no brainer and to denigrate people

3:10:18.280 --> 3:10:20.400
 for not being vaccinated, that's not the approach either

3:10:20.400 --> 3:10:23.320
 because they're gonna dig in and say,

3:10:23.320 --> 3:10:25.680
 I'm not doing this because you tell me to, right?

3:10:25.680 --> 3:10:28.600
 I think the middle ground is to say,

3:10:28.600 --> 3:10:33.600
 take a bit of both and say, here are the potential issues

3:10:33.600 --> 3:10:37.280
 and here are the benefits and this is what I would do.

3:10:37.280 --> 3:10:38.680
 And you have to just decide on your own.

3:10:38.680 --> 3:10:39.520
 I'd leave it to them.

3:10:39.520 --> 3:10:40.360
 I say, you decide.

3:10:40.360 --> 3:10:42.280
 And if you don't want to, it's up to you.

3:10:42.280 --> 3:10:44.480
 You don't have to get vaccinated.

3:10:44.480 --> 3:10:46.360
 And you'll probably get infected at some point

3:10:46.360 --> 3:10:47.760
 and maybe you'll be okay.

3:10:50.040 --> 3:10:51.640
 But here's the best available data

3:10:51.640 --> 3:10:56.640
 and it looks like the vaccines are pretty damn smart solution.

3:10:56.760 --> 3:10:57.600
 They seem to work.

3:10:57.600 --> 3:11:00.000
 I think you tell people what you did

3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:01.880
 and present both sides calmly.

3:11:01.880 --> 3:11:04.720
 And I think digging in, like in a debate,

3:11:04.720 --> 3:11:06.920
 I don't think that's terribly useful.

3:11:06.920 --> 3:11:08.920
 So that's my view.

3:11:08.920 --> 3:11:11.440
 I mean, people come to me all the time and ask me,

3:11:11.440 --> 3:11:14.680
 I'm worried, what should I do?

3:11:14.680 --> 3:11:16.120
 And I say, what are you worried about?

3:11:16.120 --> 3:11:18.960
 Let's talk about it and go through it calmly.

3:11:18.960 --> 3:11:20.720
 And if they want to still take ivermectin,

3:11:20.720 --> 3:11:22.640
 I say, it's fine, it's your choice.

3:11:22.640 --> 3:11:23.480
 And I have a problem with that.

3:11:23.480 --> 3:11:24.960
 I love that.

3:11:24.960 --> 3:11:26.680
 I love that's the way you think.

3:11:26.680 --> 3:11:30.320
 People should definitely listen to This Week in Virology

3:11:32.040 --> 3:11:33.920
 and follow your work, it's brilliant.

3:11:33.920 --> 3:11:35.760
 I've been really enjoying it lately.

3:11:35.760 --> 3:11:38.320
 It's like, it's my favorite way to stay in touch

3:11:38.320 --> 3:11:42.160
 with the happenings of COVID.

3:11:42.160 --> 3:11:45.520
 Obviously you put in a lot of other stuff in there, but.

3:11:45.520 --> 3:11:47.760
 We used to do other viruses before COVID.

3:11:47.760 --> 3:11:49.120
 It was quite interesting.

3:11:50.040 --> 3:11:52.520
 And I'm trying to slip other viruses in

3:11:52.520 --> 3:11:56.120
 because I think they're informative in many ways.

3:11:56.120 --> 3:11:57.280
 And we're gonna do more and more of that.

3:11:57.280 --> 3:11:58.600
 But I have to say I canceled,

3:11:58.600 --> 3:12:00.840
 usually I record on Tuesday and Friday

3:12:00.840 --> 3:12:02.960
 and I canceled today so I could be with you.

3:12:02.960 --> 3:12:05.040
 It's a huge honor, I appreciate that.

3:12:05.040 --> 3:12:06.680
 No, no, it's fine.

3:12:06.680 --> 3:12:10.240
 I think a couple of other people were gonna be away anyway.

3:12:10.240 --> 3:12:12.040
 So I do a lot of different pods.

3:12:12.040 --> 3:12:15.680
 They're all on YouTube, but I also do a live stream

3:12:15.680 --> 3:12:18.480
 on Wednesday nights on YouTube, which you can find.

3:12:18.480 --> 3:12:21.360
 And that's where people can come and ask questions.

3:12:21.360 --> 3:12:22.440
 We don't have an agenda.

3:12:22.440 --> 3:12:25.280
 We just start and by 30 minutes in,

3:12:25.280 --> 3:12:27.440
 there's 700 people with questions

3:12:27.440 --> 3:12:28.600
 that I can't even get through

3:12:28.600 --> 3:12:29.600
 because there's so many of them.

3:12:29.600 --> 3:12:31.720
 And I'm actually astounded

3:12:31.720 --> 3:12:35.640
 that so many people have really good questions.

3:12:35.640 --> 3:12:38.960
 Most of them are reasonable and they come back every week.

3:12:38.960 --> 3:12:41.880
 So it's turning into a great forum

3:12:41.880 --> 3:12:43.240
 to have a nice discussion.

3:12:44.120 --> 3:12:46.920
 And the YouTube channel is called what?

3:12:46.920 --> 3:12:48.960
 So you could search for my name,

3:12:48.960 --> 3:12:51.280
 which is Vincent Racaniello, it'll turn up.

3:12:51.280 --> 3:12:56.280
 Or my handle on YouTube is ProfVRR, P R O F V R R.

3:13:00.000 --> 3:13:03.040
 Have you read The Plague by Camus by any chance?

3:13:03.040 --> 3:13:05.800
 Years ago, years ago.

3:13:05.800 --> 3:13:07.160
 I have to read it again.

3:13:07.160 --> 3:13:08.720
 That's really relevant.

3:13:08.720 --> 3:13:10.840
 Let me sort of ask you a question about it.

3:13:10.840 --> 3:13:14.000
 It describes a town that's overtaken by a plague

3:13:14.000 --> 3:13:16.480
 and it's blocked off from the rest of the world.

3:13:16.480 --> 3:13:19.480
 And it kind of reveals the best, the worst of human nature.

3:13:19.480 --> 3:13:21.240
 That's like how people respond to that.

3:13:21.240 --> 3:13:25.120
 Sort of the encroaching, their own mortality,

3:13:25.120 --> 3:13:27.240
 their own death on the horizon.

3:13:27.240 --> 3:13:28.960
 I think one of the messages in the book

3:13:28.960 --> 3:13:33.960
 that ultimately like love for others.

3:13:34.160 --> 3:13:36.800
 So like a lot of people want to become isolated

3:13:36.800 --> 3:13:38.440
 and they hide from each other,

3:13:38.440 --> 3:13:42.040
 but ultimately the thing that saves you is love,

3:13:42.040 --> 3:13:45.680
 which is one of the things of just watching this pandemic,

3:13:46.680 --> 3:13:50.560
 with the distance, with the masks, that's all fine.

3:13:50.560 --> 3:13:55.560
 But there's a distancing from people of that tension,

3:13:55.560 --> 3:13:59.240
 the breaking of the common humanity between people.

3:13:59.240 --> 3:14:02.280
 That's one of the reasons when I came to Austin

3:14:02.280 --> 3:14:05.200
 earlier this year just to visit,

3:14:05.200 --> 3:14:06.440
 I fell in love with the city

3:14:06.440 --> 3:14:09.040
 because even with the masks and the distance,

3:14:09.040 --> 3:14:14.040
 there was still a camaraderie, like, I don't know,

3:14:14.600 --> 3:14:15.800
 just a love for each other,

3:14:15.800 --> 3:14:18.040
 just a kindness towards each other.

3:14:18.040 --> 3:14:20.840
 And that's why I took away from The Plague.

3:14:20.840 --> 3:14:23.400
 Mostly it's told to the story of the doctor

3:14:23.400 --> 3:14:27.000
 who basically gives in

3:14:27.000 --> 3:14:30.480
 and just gives himself as a service to others.

3:14:30.480 --> 3:14:33.000
 And that love is the thing that liberates him

3:14:33.000 --> 3:14:34.680
 from his own conception of mortality,

3:14:34.680 --> 3:14:37.920
 the fact that he's here, he's going to die.

3:14:37.920 --> 3:14:41.760
 What do you think about the effect of the virus?

3:14:41.760 --> 3:14:43.080
 We talked a lot about biology,

3:14:43.080 --> 3:14:45.280
 but the effect of the virus

3:14:45.280 --> 3:14:50.280
 on the fabric of the common humanity that connects us.

3:14:50.280 --> 3:14:54.200
 Well, that's what a pandemic does.

3:14:54.200 --> 3:14:56.280
 It really cuts that, right?

3:14:56.280 --> 3:14:58.440
 Because small outbreaks, they're local,

3:14:58.440 --> 3:15:00.880
 they don't have global effects.

3:15:00.880 --> 3:15:03.080
 But when you have something this big

3:15:03.080 --> 3:15:07.440
 where pretty much nobody escapes,

3:15:07.440 --> 3:15:10.200
 and not just making people sick,

3:15:10.200 --> 3:15:12.480
 it changes your life, right?

3:15:12.480 --> 3:15:14.600
 People lose jobs, they change jobs,

3:15:14.600 --> 3:15:16.120
 they move somewhere else.

3:15:17.240 --> 3:15:20.000
 They have all kinds of disruptions.

3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:22.080
 You know, kids can't go to school.

3:15:22.080 --> 3:15:23.560
 It really shows you.

3:15:23.560 --> 3:15:25.520
 I mean, I always like to say,

3:15:25.520 --> 3:15:30.240
 a tiny virus can bring Earth to its knees.

3:15:30.240 --> 3:15:31.920
 A tiny virus that you can't even see them,

3:15:31.920 --> 3:15:35.240
 that most people don't even think about most of the time.

3:15:35.240 --> 3:15:37.720
 And the real effect is not just sickness,

3:15:37.720 --> 3:15:39.240
 it's what it does to people.

3:15:39.240 --> 3:15:42.800
 Because in the end, we are animals,

3:15:42.800 --> 3:15:46.040
 and most animals like each other, and they interact,

3:15:46.040 --> 3:15:47.600
 they have great social structures,

3:15:47.600 --> 3:15:49.960
 and that makes them do well.

3:15:49.960 --> 3:15:53.320
 And I guess the exception is people in AI, right?

3:15:53.320 --> 3:15:56.600
 They could be on their own.

3:15:56.600 --> 3:15:57.840
 Well, that's why you build robots,

3:15:57.840 --> 3:15:58.960
 that you fall in love with.

3:15:58.960 --> 3:15:59.800
 That's right.

3:15:59.800 --> 3:16:02.000
 And so I think when a,

3:16:02.000 --> 3:16:06.040
 the real story is what it does to society, for sure.

3:16:06.040 --> 3:16:08.640
 Which has ramifications way beyond

3:16:08.640 --> 3:16:10.520
 the number of people dying,

3:16:10.520 --> 3:16:12.720
 and the vaccines, and the tests, and all of that.

3:16:12.720 --> 3:16:15.640
 And this one has really made a big rupture.

3:16:15.640 --> 3:16:17.360
 And you could tell, not now so much,

3:16:17.360 --> 3:16:18.680
 I think being out and about now,

3:16:18.680 --> 3:16:21.080
 things look pretty normal,

3:16:21.080 --> 3:16:23.760
 except for some people wearing masks.

3:16:23.760 --> 3:16:25.000
 You would never know.

3:16:25.000 --> 3:16:28.200
 I mean, the airport this morning was completely jammed.

3:16:28.200 --> 3:16:29.680
 People going, and they're all on vacation,

3:16:29.680 --> 3:16:31.480
 they're all wearing shorts, right?

3:16:31.480 --> 3:16:32.960
 So they're back to normal.

3:16:32.960 --> 3:16:34.320
 It's August.

3:16:34.320 --> 3:16:36.800
 But last year is really different.

3:16:36.800 --> 3:16:38.880
 In New York, where you're used

3:16:38.880 --> 3:16:41.160
 to lots of people on the street, it was eerie.

3:16:41.160 --> 3:16:43.040
 It was just quiet.

3:16:43.040 --> 3:16:46.000
 But under it all, people are still,

3:16:46.000 --> 3:16:49.000
 most people help each other when they have to, right?

3:16:50.120 --> 3:16:52.320
 Most people are willing to,

3:16:52.320 --> 3:16:53.640
 if something happens to someone,

3:16:53.640 --> 3:16:55.320
 to reach out and help them.

3:16:56.360 --> 3:16:58.840
 There are always exceptions where people are mean,

3:16:58.840 --> 3:17:01.880
 and that's just the way animals are.

3:17:01.880 --> 3:17:05.280
 We're not the only ones that can be mean to our own species.

3:17:05.280 --> 3:17:08.680
 But I think most of the motivation

3:17:08.680 --> 3:17:12.200
 for everything that was done is to help other people.

3:17:12.200 --> 3:17:15.600
 I mean, I do think that the vaccine manufacturers,

3:17:15.600 --> 3:17:18.120
 maybe not the leaders, but the people working in the labs

3:17:18.120 --> 3:17:20.480
 really wanted to get this out quickly

3:17:20.480 --> 3:17:22.720
 and help people, right?

3:17:22.720 --> 3:17:26.320
 I think at every level, people who are contributing

3:17:26.320 --> 3:17:27.920
 really wanted to help other people

3:17:27.920 --> 3:17:30.160
 and feel proud that they're able to do that.

3:17:30.160 --> 3:17:34.720
 So I view it as we're never gonna be 100% good

3:17:35.640 --> 3:17:37.640
 because animals are not.

3:17:37.640 --> 3:17:40.440
 Evolution made us, I mean, we're lucky.

3:17:40.440 --> 3:17:43.480
 We somehow rose above by having incredible brain

3:17:43.480 --> 3:17:45.520
 and so forth, but a lot of our base instincts

3:17:45.520 --> 3:17:47.920
 are animals, and they chase each other

3:17:47.920 --> 3:17:51.200
 and have alpha males and all that stuff,

3:17:51.200 --> 3:17:53.440
 and we always have a little bit of that in us.

3:17:53.440 --> 3:17:56.800
 But we do have some humanity

3:17:56.800 --> 3:17:59.960
 that this really ripped up, it really did.

3:18:00.960 --> 3:18:05.160
 And I think for me, someone who studied viruses

3:18:05.160 --> 3:18:07.760
 for over 40 years, it's just amazing

3:18:07.760 --> 3:18:11.240
 that an invisible thing can do that, right?

3:18:11.240 --> 3:18:13.320
 It goes back to the thing you found fascinating,

3:18:13.320 --> 3:18:15.200
 which is a virus affecting human behavior.

3:18:15.200 --> 3:18:16.040
 Yes.

3:18:16.040 --> 3:18:17.640
 Or behavior of the organism.

3:18:18.680 --> 3:18:22.920
 Yes, so humans can make weapons and do harm

3:18:22.920 --> 3:18:25.280
 and you can see that, but this you can't even see.

3:18:25.280 --> 3:18:26.240
 Yeah.

3:18:26.240 --> 3:18:27.640
 You can't, and look what it has done.

3:18:27.640 --> 3:18:29.720
 And it'll do it again, there'll be more.

3:18:29.720 --> 3:18:32.800
 I just, I wish we would be more prepared

3:18:32.800 --> 3:18:34.800
 because we know what to do.

3:18:34.800 --> 3:18:38.120
 We know we should be making antivirals vaccines,

3:18:38.120 --> 3:18:42.080
 masks, testing masks, making test modalities

3:18:42.080 --> 3:18:45.280
 that we can really quickly redesign.

3:18:46.120 --> 3:18:49.080
 But after SARS one, all that went out the door.

3:18:49.080 --> 3:18:50.160
 People didn't do anything,

3:18:50.160 --> 3:18:51.880
 and that's why we're in this situation.

3:18:51.880 --> 3:18:54.840
 So people ask me this all the time,

3:18:54.840 --> 3:18:57.800
 are we gonna be ready for the next one?

3:18:57.800 --> 3:18:59.520
 And I always say, we should be.

3:18:59.520 --> 3:19:03.000
 We have all the information we need to know what to do.

3:19:03.000 --> 3:19:05.840
 But somehow I think people forget.

3:19:05.840 --> 3:19:10.840
 That said, sometimes we really step up

3:19:12.760 --> 3:19:14.840
 when the tragedies run in front of us.

3:19:14.840 --> 3:19:15.680
 We do.

3:19:15.680 --> 3:19:16.520
 When the catastrophe.

3:19:16.520 --> 3:19:18.720
 So I don't know, somehow humans have still survived.

3:19:18.720 --> 3:19:21.080
 The fact that we had nuclear weapons for so many decades

3:19:21.080 --> 3:19:23.120
 and we still have not blown each other up,

3:19:23.120 --> 3:19:27.520
 whether by terrorists or by nation is quite surprising.

3:19:27.520 --> 3:19:30.640
 That's always, after reading the Pentagon Papers,

3:19:30.640 --> 3:19:32.920
 it's even more amazing, right?

3:19:32.920 --> 3:19:34.400
 So I don't know how we do it.

3:19:34.400 --> 3:19:39.400
 I tend to believe there's that at the surface,

3:19:40.280 --> 3:19:43.480
 you notice the greed, the corruption, the evil,

3:19:43.480 --> 3:19:46.560
 but the core of human nature, the human spirit

3:19:46.560 --> 3:19:50.840
 is one in the scientific realm is curiosity,

3:19:50.840 --> 3:19:54.280
 and more deeply is kindness, compassion,

3:19:54.280 --> 3:19:56.800
 and wanting to do good for the world.

3:19:56.800 --> 3:20:00.160
 I believe that desire to do good outpowers

3:20:00.160 --> 3:20:03.000
 all the other stuff by a large amount.

3:20:03.000 --> 3:20:06.960
 And that's why we have not yet destroyed ourselves.

3:20:06.960 --> 3:20:08.320
 There's a lot of bickering.

3:20:08.320 --> 3:20:10.360
 There's a lot of wars on the surface,

3:20:10.360 --> 3:20:11.520
 but underneath it all,

3:20:11.520 --> 3:20:16.240
 there's this ocean of love for each other.

3:20:16.240 --> 3:20:20.020
 I mean, I think there's an evolutionary advantage to that.

3:20:21.280 --> 3:20:23.640
 And it would be a good explanation

3:20:23.640 --> 3:20:25.440
 why we still haven't destroyed ourselves.

3:20:25.440 --> 3:20:27.440
 God, we had so many opportunities.

3:20:27.440 --> 3:20:29.840
 If you look at all the wars in history, so many.

3:20:29.840 --> 3:20:33.360
 I was just, my son was telling me

3:20:33.360 --> 3:20:35.880
 about the Ottoman Empire, right?

3:20:35.880 --> 3:20:39.520
 I mean, it's just war after war,

3:20:39.520 --> 3:20:42.120
 and then other countries splitting up countries

3:20:42.120 --> 3:20:45.300
 with no regard to who's living where, right?

3:20:46.560 --> 3:20:49.440
 It's just, how can these people do this?

3:20:49.440 --> 3:20:50.840
 Yeah, it's fascinating.

3:20:50.840 --> 3:20:52.040
 Human history is fascinating,

3:20:52.040 --> 3:20:54.600
 and we're still young as a species.

3:20:54.600 --> 3:20:57.360
 We have a lot more time to go,

3:20:57.360 --> 3:21:00.520
 and a lot more ways to destroy ourselves.

3:21:00.520 --> 3:21:01.660
 Do you have advice?

3:21:01.660 --> 3:21:03.880
 Like you said, you have many decades of research

3:21:03.880 --> 3:21:06.400
 and an incredible career and life.

3:21:06.400 --> 3:21:09.880
 Do you have advice for young people about career,

3:21:09.880 --> 3:21:13.360
 about life, people in high school, people in college,

3:21:13.360 --> 3:21:16.460
 of how to live a life they can be proud of?

3:21:17.460 --> 3:21:20.000
 So what I like to do is tell people,

3:21:20.000 --> 3:21:22.360
 don't plan it, because I didn't plan anything.

3:21:22.360 --> 3:21:25.000
 Everything I did was one step at a time.

3:21:25.000 --> 3:21:26.660
 You don't have to plan.

3:21:26.660 --> 3:21:30.800
 I just found things that were interesting to me.

3:21:30.800 --> 3:21:33.440
 And so my father was a doctor,

3:21:33.440 --> 3:21:35.780
 and he wanted me to be a doctor,

3:21:35.780 --> 3:21:39.040
 but I was not interested in taking care of people.

3:21:39.040 --> 3:21:43.160
 I learned that, but I couldn't say no to him.

3:21:43.160 --> 3:21:46.320
 So I was a biology major in college,

3:21:46.320 --> 3:21:51.320
 and I graduated, and I didn't have anything to do.

3:21:51.660 --> 3:21:54.800
 So I liked science, so I got a job in a lab.

3:21:54.800 --> 3:21:57.720
 And it was very exciting,

3:21:57.720 --> 3:22:00.680
 and that led to everything else

3:22:00.680 --> 3:22:02.880
 that I've done one step at a time.

3:22:02.880 --> 3:22:05.800
 And I think the most important thing you can do,

3:22:05.800 --> 3:22:06.960
 well, there are two important things.

3:22:06.960 --> 3:22:08.640
 You can be really curious all the time.

3:22:08.640 --> 3:22:10.040
 You mentioned curiosity.

3:22:10.040 --> 3:22:12.040
 I think curiosity is essential.

3:22:12.980 --> 3:22:15.580
 You have to be curious about everything.

3:22:15.580 --> 3:22:18.160
 And if you are, you're never gonna be bored.

3:22:19.240 --> 3:22:20.920
 And so people who say they're bored,

3:22:20.920 --> 3:22:22.520
 I say, you are not curious.

3:22:22.520 --> 3:22:24.200
 You should just think about things

3:22:24.200 --> 3:22:27.440
 and say, look at something and say, how does that work?

3:22:27.440 --> 3:22:29.320
 Or what is it doing, and how do they get there?

3:22:29.320 --> 3:22:30.480
 And you'll never be bored.

3:22:30.480 --> 3:22:32.840
 And the other thing is when you find something,

3:22:32.840 --> 3:22:35.340
 which may take time, it's fine.

3:22:36.960 --> 3:22:38.540
 You have to be passionate about it.

3:22:38.540 --> 3:22:40.860
 You have to put everything into it.

3:22:40.860 --> 3:22:42.920
 And that's what I did with viruses.

3:22:42.920 --> 3:22:46.240
 So I think they're amazing.

3:22:46.240 --> 3:22:51.160
 And I tell my classes, I love viruses.

3:22:51.160 --> 3:22:53.120
 They're amazing, and people think I'm morbid

3:22:53.120 --> 3:22:55.320
 because obviously they kill people,

3:22:55.320 --> 3:22:56.560
 and I shouldn't love something.

3:22:56.560 --> 3:22:57.480
 But that's not the point.

3:22:57.480 --> 3:22:58.320
 That's not what I mean.

3:22:58.320 --> 3:23:00.520
 I love them in the way they have emerged

3:23:00.520 --> 3:23:03.080
 and how they work and so forth

3:23:03.080 --> 3:23:04.240
 and all that we don't know about them.

3:23:04.240 --> 3:23:06.240
 So you need to be curious and passionate,

3:23:06.240 --> 3:23:07.720
 and don't plan too much.

3:23:07.720 --> 3:23:11.040
 And just find something that you don't call a job.

3:23:12.240 --> 3:23:14.520
 As someone said on the livestream last week,

3:23:14.520 --> 3:23:17.360
 I wish I had a job I liked as much as you.

3:23:17.360 --> 3:23:18.440
 I said, it's not a job.

3:23:18.440 --> 3:23:20.400
 I never looked at it as a job.

3:23:20.400 --> 3:23:23.720
 It's my vocation, it's my passion.

3:23:23.720 --> 3:23:25.880
 If it's a job, then you're not gonna like it.

3:23:25.880 --> 3:23:28.400
 Yeah, something that doesn't feel like a job.

3:23:28.400 --> 3:23:33.040
 So you said viruses are kind of passive,

3:23:33.880 --> 3:23:38.520
 nonliving, you could say, or even cells are passive.

3:23:38.520 --> 3:23:39.840
 And humans are kind of active.

3:23:39.840 --> 3:23:42.320
 We seem to be making our own decisions.

3:23:42.320 --> 3:23:44.720
 So let me ask you the why question.

3:23:44.720 --> 3:23:47.620
 What do you think is the meaning of this life of ours?

3:23:47.620 --> 3:23:49.780
 Oh, there's no meaning.

3:23:49.780 --> 3:23:51.340
 It just happened.

3:23:51.340 --> 3:23:52.260
 It's an accident.

3:23:53.500 --> 3:23:55.020
 I think there's no life elsewhere

3:23:55.020 --> 3:23:56.740
 because this is just a rare accident

3:23:56.740 --> 3:23:58.660
 that happened in the right conditions.

3:23:58.660 --> 3:24:00.300
 I mean, people all think I'm wrong

3:24:00.300 --> 3:24:01.700
 because there are billions and billions

3:24:01.700 --> 3:24:02.860
 of stars out there, right?

3:24:02.860 --> 3:24:05.140
 So there's a lot of opportunity.

3:24:05.140 --> 3:24:06.260
 There's no meaning.

3:24:06.260 --> 3:24:10.500
 It's just, what do they call it?

3:24:10.500 --> 3:24:12.660
 A perfect storm of events

3:24:12.660 --> 3:24:14.900
 that led to molecules being formed.

3:24:14.900 --> 3:24:17.260
 And eventually, I mean, it took a long time

3:24:17.260 --> 3:24:19.900
 for life to evolve, right?

3:24:19.900 --> 3:24:23.980
 But it's just driven by conditions.

3:24:23.980 --> 3:24:25.500
 If something emerged that worked,

3:24:25.500 --> 3:24:26.980
 it would then go on to the next step.

3:24:26.980 --> 3:24:29.140
 There's no meaning other than that.

3:24:29.140 --> 3:24:31.100
 The only difference is that we,

3:24:32.180 --> 3:24:34.060
 and I think many other animals can probably,

3:24:34.060 --> 3:24:36.020
 we have the ability, we're sentient, right?

3:24:36.020 --> 3:24:38.200
 We can influence what happens to us.

3:24:39.160 --> 3:24:41.420
 We can take medicines, right?

3:24:41.420 --> 3:24:44.420
 We can alter what would normally happen to us.

3:24:44.420 --> 3:24:47.860
 So we can remove some of the selection pressure.

3:24:48.740 --> 3:24:50.840
 But I think everything else on the planet

3:24:50.840 --> 3:24:55.180
 just goes, looks for food and give a lot of offspring

3:24:55.180 --> 3:24:56.220
 so you can perpetuate.

3:24:56.220 --> 3:24:58.740
 It's just a natural biological function.

3:24:58.740 --> 3:25:01.980
 Yeah, they're much more directly concerned with survival.

3:25:01.980 --> 3:25:04.620
 I think humans are able to contemplate their mortality.

3:25:04.620 --> 3:25:08.500
 We can see that even if we're okay today,

3:25:08.500 --> 3:25:10.300
 we're eventually going to die

3:25:10.300 --> 3:25:13.020
 and we really don't like that.

3:25:13.020 --> 3:25:16.140
 So we try to come up with ways to push that deadline

3:25:16.140 --> 3:25:17.060
 farther and farther away.

3:25:17.060 --> 3:25:18.740
 Well, we have really, I mean,

3:25:18.740 --> 3:25:20.460
 we used to die in our 30s, right?

3:25:20.460 --> 3:25:22.020
 Now it's 70s, 80s.

3:25:22.020 --> 3:25:26.140
 Well, most of us used to die in the first few weeks.

3:25:26.140 --> 3:25:27.260
 That's true.

3:25:27.260 --> 3:25:29.140
 Yeah, infant death.

3:25:29.140 --> 3:25:34.140
 I always tell people the only thing that's 100% is death.

3:25:34.260 --> 3:25:36.300
 It's the only thing in the world that's 100%.

3:25:36.300 --> 3:25:37.700
 Do you think about your own mortality?

3:25:37.700 --> 3:25:39.020
 No, I never think about it.

3:25:39.020 --> 3:25:42.220
 I'm just enjoying day to day and I don't think about it.

3:25:42.220 --> 3:25:43.060
 Really?

3:25:43.060 --> 3:25:44.140
 You work on viruses.

3:25:44.140 --> 3:25:47.580
 You don't contemplate your own mortality

3:25:47.580 --> 3:25:51.660
 given the deadliness of the viruses around us?

3:25:51.660 --> 3:25:53.580
 I never thought COVID would kill me.

3:25:53.580 --> 3:25:55.460
 No, I never was afraid of that.

3:25:55.460 --> 3:25:56.460
 Not at all.

3:25:56.460 --> 3:26:00.380
 I mostly feared for other people getting sick,

3:26:00.380 --> 3:26:02.380
 especially people who could die of it.

3:26:02.380 --> 3:26:03.600
 I didn't want that to happen to them.

3:26:03.600 --> 3:26:06.860
 But I always thought that it's obviously

3:26:06.860 --> 3:26:10.740
 not a realistic viewpoint not to be worried

3:26:10.740 --> 3:26:13.820
 because many people are.

3:26:13.820 --> 3:26:16.060
 But I've been relatively healthy.

3:26:17.100 --> 3:26:19.740
 They should sequence my genome because it works really well

3:26:19.740 --> 3:26:21.260
 and I have a good immune system.

3:26:21.260 --> 3:26:24.100
 Maybe you'd be the first immortal person.

3:26:24.100 --> 3:26:25.820
 There's gotta be a first.

3:26:25.820 --> 3:26:27.100
 I don't think so.

3:26:27.100 --> 3:26:31.180
 I think that biologically you just can't,

3:26:31.180 --> 3:26:32.940
 the ends of our chromosomes keep getting

3:26:32.940 --> 3:26:36.120
 shorter and shorter and that's eventually what kills us.

3:26:37.200 --> 3:26:39.580
 So you just can't keep going on.

3:26:39.580 --> 3:26:42.220
 But that's fine, I don't need to.

3:26:42.220 --> 3:26:43.700
 I understand from the vampires

3:26:43.700 --> 3:26:45.460
 that it's not good to live forever.

3:26:47.340 --> 3:26:50.380
 I guess make the most of the time you got.

3:26:50.380 --> 3:26:53.200
 That's the, bacteria live a much shorter time

3:26:53.200 --> 3:26:55.180
 so we got that on bacteria.

3:26:55.180 --> 3:27:00.100
 Bacteria are just little bags of chemicals that split.

3:27:00.100 --> 3:27:05.100
 So they have no stake in the matter at all.

3:27:05.260 --> 3:27:06.540
 It doesn't bother.

3:27:06.540 --> 3:27:08.180
 I think that you have to go a long ways

3:27:08.180 --> 3:27:12.960
 before you get into some kind of consciousness.

3:27:12.960 --> 3:27:15.420
 Yeah, it's weird that this bag of chemicals

3:27:15.420 --> 3:27:17.040
 has a stake in the matter.

3:27:17.040 --> 3:27:21.380
 Like our human body, consciousness is a weird thing.

3:27:21.380 --> 3:27:23.540
 Not just in us, but they make half of the oxygen

3:27:23.540 --> 3:27:24.380
 on the planet.

3:27:24.380 --> 3:27:26.340
 20% of the oxygen comes from bacteria.

3:27:27.920 --> 3:27:29.900
 And they made, in the beginning of Earth,

3:27:29.900 --> 3:27:34.060
 they made enough oxygen to start oxygenation going,

3:27:34.060 --> 3:27:34.900
 life going.

3:27:34.900 --> 3:27:36.500
 I mean, they have an incredible role.

3:27:36.500 --> 3:27:38.300
 It's all an accident, just happened.

3:27:40.500 --> 3:27:44.660
 Well, Vincent, like I told you, I'm a huge fan.

3:27:44.660 --> 3:27:47.060
 It's a big honor that you would talk to me today.

3:27:47.060 --> 3:27:48.420
 Thank you so much for coming down.

3:27:48.420 --> 3:27:50.620
 Thank you for spending so much time with me.

3:27:51.660 --> 3:27:53.020
 And thank you for everything you do

3:27:53.020 --> 3:27:54.900
 in terms of educating about viruses,

3:27:54.900 --> 3:27:57.300
 about biology, microbiology, and everything else.

3:27:57.300 --> 3:27:58.160
 I can't wait.

3:27:58.160 --> 3:28:00.540
 Everybody should check out Vincent's YouTube,

3:28:00.540 --> 3:28:03.020
 watch his lectures, listen to the podcast.

3:28:03.020 --> 3:28:05.060
 It's truly incredible.

3:28:05.060 --> 3:28:06.780
 Thank you so much for talking to me, Vincent.

3:28:06.780 --> 3:28:08.220
 My pleasure.

3:28:08.220 --> 3:28:10.220
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

3:28:10.220 --> 3:28:12.260
 with Vincent Racaniello.

3:28:12.260 --> 3:28:13.380
 To support this podcast,

3:28:13.380 --> 3:28:16.540
 please check out our sponsors in the description.

3:28:16.540 --> 3:28:18.740
 And now, let me leave you with some words

3:28:18.740 --> 3:28:20.980
 from Isaac Asimov.

3:28:20.980 --> 3:28:23.140
 The saddest aspect of life right now

3:28:23.140 --> 3:28:25.380
 is that science gathers knowledge

3:28:25.380 --> 3:28:27.720
 faster than society gathers wisdom.

3:28:27.720 --> 3:28:37.720
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
