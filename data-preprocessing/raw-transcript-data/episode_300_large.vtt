00:00.480 --> 00:03.400
 The following is a conversation with Joe Rogan,

00:03.400 --> 00:06.120
 his second time on this podcast.

00:06.120 --> 00:09.720
 He has inspired me for many years with his conversations

00:09.720 --> 00:11.960
 to be a better and kinder person

00:11.960 --> 00:14.480
 and has now been doing so as a friend.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.840
 There's no one I would rather talk to

00:17.840 --> 00:22.840
 on this 300th episode of this podcast on the 4th of July,

00:23.400 --> 00:25.480
 both the anniversary of this country's

00:25.480 --> 00:27.200
 declaration of independence

00:27.200 --> 00:30.080
 and the anniversary of my immigrating here

00:30.080 --> 00:31.760
 to the United States.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.520
 A silly kid who couldn't speak English

00:34.520 --> 00:38.400
 and could never imagine that he will be so damn lucky

00:38.400 --> 00:40.840
 as to live the life I've lived

00:40.840 --> 00:43.680
 and to feel the love I felt

00:43.680 --> 00:45.640
 from the amazing people along the way.

00:46.560 --> 00:49.880
 From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

00:49.880 --> 00:50.720
 I love you all.

00:52.280 --> 00:54.400
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:56.680 --> 00:58.040
 in the description.

00:58.040 --> 01:01.560
 And now, dear friends, here's Joe Rogan.

01:02.600 --> 01:05.520
 Charles Bukowski said something in a poem called Style

01:05.520 --> 01:07.320
 about art.

01:07.320 --> 01:11.320
 He defined art saying style is the answer to everything,

01:11.320 --> 01:14.480
 a fresh way to approach a dull or dangerous thing.

01:14.480 --> 01:16.920
 To do a dull thing with style is preferable

01:16.920 --> 01:19.440
 to doing a dangerous thing without it.

01:19.440 --> 01:23.560
 To do a dangerous thing with style is what I call art.

01:23.560 --> 01:25.000
 What do you think he meant by that?

01:25.000 --> 01:26.240
 Do you agree with this?

01:26.240 --> 01:29.000
 A dangerous thing with style is art.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.720
 He said bullfighting can be art, boxing can be art,

01:31.720 --> 01:33.000
 loving can be art.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.360
 Have you ever made love and it was art?

01:35.360 --> 01:37.240
 No, okay, I'm not asking.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.400
 Every time, bro.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.200
 Opening a can of sardines can be art.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.200
 I think there's something to that.

01:44.200 --> 01:48.440
 Yeah, I think, I call the way people live life art.

01:48.440 --> 01:50.480
 Like I wrote a foreword to my friend,

01:50.480 --> 01:53.720
 Cameron Haynes's book, which is right now

01:53.720 --> 01:55.880
 the number one selling audio book in the world.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.880
 And one of the things that I said was that

01:58.880 --> 02:02.680
 he practices an art that very few people appreciate

02:02.680 --> 02:05.760
 and it's the art of the maximized life.

02:05.760 --> 02:10.760
 And that the discipline that he displays in his life

02:11.000 --> 02:14.840
 and through his practices and all the things that he does,

02:14.840 --> 02:19.640
 it's so difficult to live the way he lives

02:19.640 --> 02:22.680
 that for someone like me who understands it

02:22.680 --> 02:25.000
 and knows what he's doing and appreciates it

02:25.000 --> 02:29.400
 and appreciates how insanely difficult it is

02:29.400 --> 02:32.640
 to have a full time job and run ultra marathons,

02:32.640 --> 02:33.880
 get up at four o clock in the morning,

02:33.880 --> 02:36.600
 run a full marathon before work.

02:36.600 --> 02:39.120
 Like that's the kind of shit that he does

02:39.120 --> 02:43.040
 when he's training for these 240 mile runs,

02:45.240 --> 02:50.240
 at the same time being like a father, a husband,

02:50.760 --> 02:52.880
 having this full time job,

02:52.880 --> 02:55.800
 also being the best bow hunter on earth, lifting weights.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.480
 It's like, how does a person do this?

02:58.480 --> 03:00.520
 So in a way, discipline is art too.

03:00.520 --> 03:02.360
 Yes, discipline is art.

03:02.360 --> 03:05.320
 Yeah, I think it is, because it's beautiful for me to see.

03:05.320 --> 03:07.960
 When I see someone who's really truly disciplined,

03:07.960 --> 03:09.360
 who like a David Goggins,

03:09.360 --> 03:12.560
 someone who just like truly maximizes the grind,

03:12.560 --> 03:14.600
 I feel like there's an art to that.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.880
 And there's an art to kindness.

03:16.880 --> 03:19.240
 Like there's people that are really kind and really sweet

03:19.240 --> 03:20.600
 and when I'm around them, it's beautiful.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.040
 It's like there's an art to them.

03:22.040 --> 03:22.860
 No matter what.

03:22.860 --> 03:23.700
 Yeah.

03:23.700 --> 03:24.920
 They still, they got,

03:24.920 --> 03:26.560
 the world can throw a bunch of shit at you,

03:26.560 --> 03:27.400
 but through all of that.

03:27.400 --> 03:30.000
 Yeah, some people are just great at it.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.480
 And it's a thing that you learn how to do.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.760
 And it's pleasing for other people to see.

03:35.760 --> 03:38.760
 And that I think is where the art is.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.480
 Well, I think Bukowski also said,

03:42.080 --> 03:44.480
 and I'm just a Bukowski quote generator today.

03:44.480 --> 03:45.440
 I love him.

03:45.440 --> 03:46.720
 I love him very much too.

03:47.720 --> 03:50.520
 He's a dark and troubled and fascinating and a weird person,

03:50.520 --> 03:51.840
 like Hunter S. Thompson.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.440
 He said, what matters most

03:53.440 --> 03:56.880
 is how you walk through the fire, I think.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.840
 So there's a bit of the Ken Haines in that too,

03:58.840 --> 04:00.880
 David Goggins in that too.

04:00.880 --> 04:02.680
 What do you think he meant by that?

04:03.800 --> 04:05.520
 Well, how you walk through the fire.

04:05.520 --> 04:07.320
 I mean, you can walk through the fire

04:07.320 --> 04:08.640
 complaining along the way,

04:08.640 --> 04:10.680
 or you can walk through the fire

04:10.680 --> 04:14.680
 and create an example for everyone else

04:14.680 --> 04:18.400
 so that the trials and tribulations of their own lives

04:18.400 --> 04:21.320
 seem trivial because they're comparing themselves

04:21.320 --> 04:22.720
 to the way you handle things,

04:22.720 --> 04:26.200
 or the way you handle things with grace and dignity

04:26.200 --> 04:29.440
 and discipline can show other people

04:29.440 --> 04:32.920
 that they can handle their own life this way.

04:32.920 --> 04:35.160
 And there's beauty in that, there really is.

04:35.160 --> 04:37.960
 And there's so much inspiration

04:37.960 --> 04:40.080
 to be gathered from other people

04:40.080 --> 04:41.600
 if you're a charitable person,

04:41.600 --> 04:44.480
 if you're charitable and compassionate

04:44.480 --> 04:47.280
 and you can look at people,

04:47.280 --> 04:49.960
 even people that I don't like,

04:49.960 --> 04:52.360
 I try to look at the best aspects

04:52.360 --> 04:53.760
 of how they live their life

04:53.760 --> 04:58.400
 and recognize those aspects, admire them,

04:58.400 --> 05:00.160
 give them credit for it.

05:00.160 --> 05:02.800
 There's something that we can all get out of

05:02.800 --> 05:05.560
 watching the way other people live their lives.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.880
 So I got a chance to see you walk through the fire

05:07.880 --> 05:12.880
 a little bit privately and publicly this year in January.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.720
 I gotta ask you about that.

05:15.720 --> 05:17.960
 So there's like generic conversations

05:17.960 --> 05:20.640
 about sort of cancel culture and all those kinds of things.

05:20.640 --> 05:24.160
 But as a human being, this to me is fascinating.

05:24.160 --> 05:27.120
 Sort of there's the N word highlight video,

05:27.120 --> 05:30.080
 there's the criticism of the different guests,

05:30.080 --> 05:33.800
 whatever the side is on the COVID pandemic.

05:33.800 --> 05:38.800
 And you, I mean, there's a mass amount of attack on you.

05:41.120 --> 05:42.760
 Outside of being a public persona,

05:42.760 --> 05:45.960
 outside of being a comedian, podcaster,

05:45.960 --> 05:47.600
 you're also a human being.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.640
 So how did you survive that?

05:50.640 --> 05:54.280
 How did you sort of walk through that fire?

05:54.280 --> 05:56.160
 Because you seem to do it with grace.

05:58.360 --> 05:59.480
 I used mushrooms.

06:01.440 --> 06:03.280
 That was one way I did it.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.120
 Really.

06:04.120 --> 06:05.800
 What's your, as Andrew Huberman would say,

06:05.800 --> 06:07.520
 what was your protocol?

06:07.520 --> 06:12.000
 I took, it was probably less than a gram every day.

06:12.000 --> 06:12.840
 Every day?

06:12.840 --> 06:13.960
 Yeah.

06:13.960 --> 06:18.960
 And I did a lot of like really hard working out.

06:20.560 --> 06:25.560
 But also, I mean, there's a great benefit

06:26.120 --> 06:28.800
 to going through anything difficult.

06:28.800 --> 06:33.800
 And if you're aware, like in advance and during,

06:34.080 --> 06:35.480
 like anything that's gonna happen

06:35.480 --> 06:38.960
 that's very difficult and troubling,

06:38.960 --> 06:42.880
 the great benefit is it gives you an opportunity to grow,

06:42.880 --> 06:45.800
 gives you an opportunity to express yourself

06:45.800 --> 06:48.560
 under pressure, to show your character,

06:48.560 --> 06:50.200
 to show who you truly are.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.720
 And it gives you an opportunity to see

06:52.720 --> 06:56.240
 how you handle a very difficult situation.

06:56.240 --> 07:00.960
 It also was fascinating as a person

07:00.960 --> 07:03.920
 that's involved in media, right?

07:03.920 --> 07:06.400
 Because what we're doing right now is media,

07:06.400 --> 07:10.600
 even though it seems, like podcasts seem

07:10.600 --> 07:12.560
 like we're just having a conversation, right?

07:12.560 --> 07:15.280
 And they are, and in that sense,

07:15.280 --> 07:17.840
 it's kind of the purest form of media

07:17.840 --> 07:22.840
 because what you're doing is you're doing it

07:22.880 --> 07:26.920
 without any fanfare, you're doing it without any,

07:26.920 --> 07:30.000
 there's no executives looming over your head

07:30.000 --> 07:32.840
 or network or big meetings about ratings

07:32.840 --> 07:35.000
 or any of that stuff, but it is media.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.480
 But what I got to see is the wiring under the machine

07:38.480 --> 07:43.000
 of how the rest of media would try to take me out.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.440
 And like when CNN would just be playing things

07:46.440 --> 07:50.480
 over and over and back and forth, it was wild to watch.

07:50.480 --> 07:53.560
 What was also wild to watch was people's responses

07:54.600 --> 07:59.600
 because I gained two million subscribers during that time.

08:00.520 --> 08:02.560
 Like the podcast never got bigger.

08:02.560 --> 08:05.880
 It just kept growing, it had never been bigger

08:05.880 --> 08:09.120
 than it had been at the end of all of it.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.560
 It just made it bigger.

08:10.560 --> 08:15.560
 And ultimately, if you've fucked up in the past

08:16.200 --> 08:18.200
 or made mistakes or done something wrong,

08:19.240 --> 08:22.120
 that gives you an opportunity to discuss those things

08:22.120 --> 08:26.440
 and to say, to apologize if you feel the need to apologize

08:26.440 --> 08:29.240
 and also to just address it.

08:29.240 --> 08:32.800
 And so people under that kind of pressure,

08:32.800 --> 08:34.480
 it's an opportunity for them to understand

08:34.480 --> 08:36.760
 how you think about things honestly,

08:36.760 --> 08:39.080
 how you actually honestly think about things.

08:39.080 --> 08:42.040
 And there's no more honesty that you get out of a person

08:42.040 --> 08:45.120
 than when that person is under extreme duress.

08:45.120 --> 08:48.560
 So I think in that sense, I mean, it's horrible to say

08:48.560 --> 08:50.360
 that it's a benefit, that it's a good thing

08:50.360 --> 08:52.520
 that it happened, but it was a benefit.

08:52.520 --> 08:54.520
 Can you see how it can break a person?

08:54.520 --> 08:55.360
 Yes.

08:55.360 --> 08:59.080
 I've gotten the chance to experience small attacks

08:59.080 --> 09:01.680
 here and there, ones that get to the core of things.

09:01.680 --> 09:06.680
 Like even just talking about Russia and Ukraine,

09:06.800 --> 09:09.160
 to Stephen Calkin or Oliver Stone,

09:09.160 --> 09:10.720
 looking at different perspectives,

09:10.720 --> 09:15.600
 you gain, for me, feeling like a sizable number of people

09:15.600 --> 09:20.600
 who really don't like you and say things about you

09:20.600 --> 09:25.600
 that may be cut deep for a reason I don't understand why.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.640
 It's just my own psychology.

09:28.640 --> 09:30.760
 Well, it's also because you can't defend yourself

09:30.760 --> 09:33.640
 because they're saying it and you're not there

09:33.640 --> 09:37.440
 and you don't have any opportunity for a rebuttal.

09:37.440 --> 09:40.200
 And if you do have a rebuttal, you're doing it publicly

09:40.200 --> 09:43.160
 and you're opening it up to the whole world to chime in.

09:43.160 --> 09:47.040
 And there's a general tendency that people have

09:47.040 --> 09:49.200
 towards negativity when they're interacting

09:49.200 --> 09:51.040
 with strangers online,

09:51.040 --> 09:53.240
 especially about controversial subjects.

09:53.240 --> 09:56.720
 And even if it's only 10% of the people, it's one out of 10.

09:56.720 --> 09:57.840
 That's a lot.

09:57.840 --> 09:59.640
 That's a lot of negativity when you're dealing

09:59.640 --> 10:02.080
 with thousands and thousands of tweets.

10:02.080 --> 10:04.400
 Yeah, and I think,

10:04.400 --> 10:06.440
 maybe I'm just a very self critical person,

10:06.440 --> 10:09.120
 but I hear their words and I probably,

10:09.120 --> 10:12.560
 somewhere deep inside, see the truth in the criticism,

10:12.560 --> 10:15.520
 in some aspect of the criticism, and that's why it hurts.

10:17.080 --> 10:20.600
 But it's in one aspect of you.

10:20.600 --> 10:21.440
 Right.

10:21.440 --> 10:24.520
 But when you're reading it, it's so,

10:24.520 --> 10:28.320
 it's boiled down to this one thing,

10:28.320 --> 10:31.520
 as if that one thing defines you totally.

10:31.520 --> 10:33.200
 Like if you've made a mistake,

10:33.200 --> 10:36.000
 if you've said something that you shouldn't have said,

10:36.000 --> 10:39.920
 or if you said something and maybe you should have

10:39.920 --> 10:41.560
 considered it more carefully,

10:41.560 --> 10:43.800
 given the gravity of the situation,

10:45.280 --> 10:47.160
 that's just a part of being a person.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.600
 And it's also part of being a person where you're

10:49.600 --> 10:53.120
 communicating with things publicly in real time,

10:53.120 --> 10:56.000
 thinking out loud, which is what we do.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.480
 It's complex and most people don't do it.

10:58.480 --> 11:00.880
 And you're gonna have these,

11:00.880 --> 11:03.880
 you're gonna have genuine hot takes

11:03.880 --> 11:07.040
 where people just see what you said

11:07.040 --> 11:08.440
 and go, why did he say that?

11:08.440 --> 11:09.840
 Fuck him.

11:09.840 --> 11:13.200
 He doesn't know anything about, he doesn't live in Ukraine.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.440
 It's like, there's people that are gonna have takes

11:15.440 --> 11:17.640
 on that in that way.

11:17.640 --> 11:20.520
 And then there's also gonna be these disingenuous people

11:20.520 --> 11:24.320
 who just use any kind of controversial topic or subject

11:24.320 --> 11:26.600
 as an opportunity for them to get clicks or views.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.880
 But the number of those people can be quite large.

11:29.880 --> 11:30.840
 Quite large.

11:30.840 --> 11:33.600
 And so, going back to,

11:33.600 --> 11:35.040
 do you think it can destroy a person?

11:35.040 --> 11:36.280
 Because I kind of worry about this.

11:36.280 --> 11:40.040
 And you're, in many ways, but in this way, an inspiration

11:40.040 --> 11:42.760
 that it didn't seem to have destroyed you.

11:42.760 --> 11:43.600
 But is that?

11:43.600 --> 11:46.160
 I kept doing shows, I kept doing standup.

11:46.160 --> 11:47.720
 I ignored everything.

11:47.720 --> 11:49.480
 I didn't read any of it.

11:49.480 --> 11:50.800
 So it is possible to just?

11:50.800 --> 11:53.280
 100%, yes.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.280
 Yeah.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.120
 I ignored it all.

11:55.120 --> 11:55.960
 But you have like.

11:55.960 --> 11:56.800
 I knew it was there.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.400
 Like your family didn't bring it up.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.320
 My family was very aware of it.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.160
 My wife was aware of it.

12:01.160 --> 12:02.760
 What was the conversation like?

12:02.760 --> 12:06.240
 If your wife is aware of it, is there like a rule?

12:06.240 --> 12:07.520
 Pretend it's not happening.

12:07.520 --> 12:08.360
 No.

12:08.360 --> 12:09.200
 Just like.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.160
 Well, I tell her, don't ever read.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.480
 Past the green beans.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.520
 Yeah.

12:12.520 --> 12:16.280
 I don't ever let her like read negative articles to me.

12:16.280 --> 12:17.480
 You know, I don't want them.

12:17.480 --> 12:18.680
 I don't, he care.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.240
 I go, that's a person's opinion.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.320
 You take a person's opinion, you write it down.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.760
 Doesn't give it any more relevance.

12:23.760 --> 12:27.480
 Like that person, you know, could have had that opinion in silence.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.520
 They could have had it with some friends at dinner.

12:29.520 --> 12:30.680
 They don't like me, whatever.

12:30.680 --> 12:31.400
 I don't want to read it.

12:31.400 --> 12:32.160
 I don't want to absorb it.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.520
 I don't even know them, especially if I'm not there.

12:34.520 --> 12:41.640
 And especially if it's some biased and it's it's not an objective opinion of me.

12:41.640 --> 12:46.280
 It's this, you know, they have a narrative and they want to stick to that narrative

12:46.280 --> 12:50.520
 and they want to write an article and they piece it all together, make you a piece of shit.

12:50.520 --> 12:51.680
 And that's their prerogative.

12:51.680 --> 12:53.000
 They're completely out to do that.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.040
 But I know I shouldn't absorb that.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.520
 I shouldn't take that in.

12:56.520 --> 13:00.920
 You're not supposed to be taking in the opinion of the world.

13:00.920 --> 13:09.800
 You're supposed to be taking in the opinion of small groups of people that you encounter so that you get an understanding of how you make them feel.

13:09.800 --> 13:21.560
 And then maybe you say to yourself, maybe I come across too rude or maybe I come across too insensitive or maybe maybe I could do better in this way or that way.

13:21.560 --> 13:26.440
 That's how we sort of shape our personalities and it's how we we develop our social skills.

13:26.440 --> 13:35.640
 But when the people don't know you and they have this like distorted narrative of you and, you know, there's fucking millions of people.

13:35.640 --> 13:36.880
 There's so many people.

13:36.880 --> 13:47.480
 You can't be saying, you know, actually, I mean, millions of people that are like communicating about something like during the height of the, you know, the attempt to cancel me or whatever that is.

13:47.480 --> 13:50.160
 I don't know how many people were involved in that.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.680
 People take this kind of stuff seriously.

13:51.680 --> 14:05.480
 But the problem is the false narratives take hold and then you have meetings, you have groups, you have it builds on top of each other and there's this outrage and then it reaches you at some point and it can just have these destructive effects.

14:05.480 --> 14:10.040
 It can, but it also sometimes doesn't.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.280
 And in my case, it didn't.

14:11.280 --> 14:12.600
 It didn't work.

14:12.600 --> 14:15.960
 What lessons did you draw from that?

14:15.960 --> 14:17.960
 Mushrooms, exercise.

14:17.960 --> 14:20.600
 Mushrooms and exercise, exercise is critical.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.760
 So I don't think the mushrooms by themselves would have worked.

14:22.760 --> 14:27.080
 But that's the thing that I use for everything is the brutal exercise.

14:27.080 --> 14:30.040
 Like my exercise routines are horrible.

14:30.040 --> 14:33.120
 And because of that, everything else is easier.

14:33.120 --> 14:37.400
 I create my own bullshit and my own bullshit is so much harder.

14:37.400 --> 14:38.640
 And it's not just that.

14:38.640 --> 14:43.360
 It's also sauna and cold plunge and these torture sessions.

14:43.360 --> 14:50.120
 They in enduring those when you endure those, it makes enduring other things much easier.

14:50.120 --> 14:53.120
 And it's also an understanding of what's happening.

14:53.120 --> 15:05.640
 Like you have to know, like media, you have to understand, like what the hot take, you know, YouTube, social media, podcast, ecosphere is doing.

15:05.640 --> 15:15.360
 Like if they're talking about, you know, Lex Friedman said this and we have to comment on that and, you know, Lex gets canceled in all capital letters on a YouTube clip.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.640
 And if you you watch that, you're fucking crazy.

15:17.640 --> 15:19.880
 What are you doing, absorbing all this negativity?

15:19.880 --> 15:20.760
 It's not good for you.

15:20.760 --> 15:27.880
 You are you, you know, you and you know, generally, if you've made a mistake, you know, generally, if people are upset with you.

15:27.880 --> 15:35.800
 You posted this awesome video on your Instagram of a woman who was being interviewed in 19, late 1920s, maybe.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.040
 Yes. Yeah.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.800
 And she's close to 100 years old.

15:40.800 --> 15:44.440
 So she's lived through the Civil War, through World War One.

15:44.440 --> 15:48.480
 She was at the time living through the early days of the Great Depression.

15:48.480 --> 15:56.200
 So I was just looking back, you know, what have we as a human civilization in recent times survived, especially in the United States?

15:56.200 --> 16:04.960
 You're talking about the two world wars in the 20th century, the Great Depression, the Spanish food, the pandemic at the beginning of the 20th century.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.640
 Yeah. What do we do in the United States?

16:07.640 --> 16:15.080
 9 11. If you think of what are the traumatic events that shook our world, it's 9 11.

16:15.080 --> 16:19.560
 It made us rethink our place in the world.

16:19.560 --> 16:26.120
 The pandemic pandemic is a huge one is one of the bigger ones, because it also accelerated and exacerbated

16:26.120 --> 16:32.320
 our anxiety, which people have a certain level of anxiety already, especially sedentary people.

16:32.320 --> 16:40.360
 They have a very high level of anxiety already because I don't think they're they're giving their body what it what it needs.

16:40.360 --> 16:44.960
 I don't think they're you know, your body has certain requirements in terms of movement.

16:44.960 --> 16:52.200
 And when you deny your body those requirements, I think there's like a general level of anxiety that exists in almost everyone.

16:52.200 --> 16:58.720
 And then you have people obviously that have mental health issues and that also exacerbates the anxiety.

16:58.720 --> 17:05.600
 The lockdown exacerbated the anxiety, losing loved ones to the pandemic, exacerbated anxiety.

17:05.600 --> 17:15.000
 And then there was the the division that the different schools of thought, the people that were never going to get vaccinated no matter what.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.240
 I ain't trusting it. People thought there was microchips in there.

17:18.240 --> 17:23.960
 People that thought that, you know, Fauci's the demon and there's there was a lot.

17:23.960 --> 17:27.040
 And there's also like political leanings.

17:27.040 --> 17:38.640
 The right wing people tended to not want to be vaccinated, whereas the left wing people, for whatever reason, all of a sudden are trusting pharmaceutical companies like explicitly.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.720
 It was weird. It was a weird time.

17:41.720 --> 17:51.400
 And I think over time, as it's going to as it gets analyzed and we break it down, it's going to be one of the weirder moments for shaping human culture.

17:51.400 --> 18:08.320
 And unfortunately for throwing gasoline on this already burning fire of, you know, of conflict between the various factions of of thought in this country.

18:08.320 --> 18:18.040
 Just it's already a weird time, you know, post Trump, like the Trump era is also going to be one of the weirder times.

18:18.040 --> 18:28.360
 When when people look back historically about the division in this country, he's such a polarizing figure that so many people felt like.

18:28.360 --> 18:43.320
 They could abandon their own ethics and morals and principles just to attack him and anybody who supports him because he is an existential threat to democracy itself.

18:43.320 --> 18:49.200
 But don't you think it's not a cause, but maybe like a symptom, like it's going to get you said it got real weird.

18:49.200 --> 18:52.640
 Maybe it's going to get weirder. Yeah, I think it's going to get weirder.

18:52.640 --> 18:57.120
 He's going to run again. You think he wins? Well, he's running against a dead man.

18:57.120 --> 19:01.960
 You know, I mean, Biden shakes hands with people that aren't even there when he gets off stage.

19:01.960 --> 19:07.360
 I think he's seeing ghosts. Yeah. You see him on Jimmy Kimmel the other day? No. Well, he was just rambling.

19:07.360 --> 19:19.760
 I mean, he's if he was anyone else, if he was a Republican, if that was Donald Trump doing that, every fucking talk show would be screaming for him to be off the air.

19:19.760 --> 19:23.640
 And by the way, I'm not a Trump supporter in any way, shape or form.

19:23.640 --> 19:27.640
 I've had the opportunity to have him on my show more than once. I've said no every time.

19:27.640 --> 19:31.720
 I don't want to help him. I'm not interested in helping. The night is still young.

19:31.720 --> 19:36.760
 We'll see if I have him on the night is still young. I think I'll have him on. I think you'll have him on. Really?

19:36.760 --> 19:43.560
 Why do you think that? Because you'll have Putin on. And you're competitive as fuck.

19:43.560 --> 19:56.200
 No, I think ultimately, I mean, you had you've had a lot of people that I think you might you may otherwise be skeptical.

19:56.200 --> 20:00.000
 Would I have a good conversation, which I think is your metric. You don't care about politics.

20:00.000 --> 20:07.800
 So can I have a good conversation? And I think you had like people like Kanye on, for example, and you had a great conversation with him.

20:07.800 --> 20:18.160
 I think you I think he is an artist, but Kanye doing well or not doing well doesn't change the course of our country.

20:18.160 --> 20:25.800
 Yeah, but, you know, do you really bear the responsibility of the course of our country based on a conversation?

20:25.800 --> 20:36.680
 I think you can revitalize and rehabilitate someone's image in a way that is pretty shocking.

20:36.680 --> 20:41.760
 Look at the way people look at Alex Jones now, because Alex Jones has been on my podcast a few times.

20:41.760 --> 20:43.760
 Yeah. How do they which direction?

20:43.760 --> 20:47.400
 The people that have watched those podcasts think he's hilarious.

20:47.400 --> 20:53.000
 And they think that he definitely fucked up with that whole Sandy Hook thing.

20:53.000 --> 20:59.160
 But he's right more than he's wrong. And he's not an evil guy.

20:59.160 --> 21:06.200
 He's just a guy who's had some psychotic breaks in his life. He's had some genuine mental health issues that he's addressed.

21:06.200 --> 21:15.400
 He's had some serious bouts of alcoholism, some serious bouts of substance abuse, and they've contributed to some very poor thinking.

21:15.400 --> 21:21.080
 But if you know the guy, if you get to know him like I have, I've known him for more than 20 years.

21:21.080 --> 21:32.320
 And if you know him on podcasts, you realize like he is genuinely trying to unearth some things that are genuinely disturbing for most people.

21:32.320 --> 21:39.720
 Like this is a guy that was telling me about Epstein's Island fucking decade ago.

21:39.720 --> 21:43.520
 At least he was telling me about I was like, what you're telling me?

21:43.520 --> 21:50.760
 There's a place where they bring elites to compromise them with underage girls and they film them.

21:50.760 --> 21:53.320
 Really? Like what? Cut the fuck out here.

21:53.320 --> 21:55.840
 Like, no, President Clinton's been there. Everyone's been there.

21:55.840 --> 21:58.000
 Like, but it sounds like nonsense.

21:58.000 --> 22:05.560
 And not only is it true, but people keep getting fucking murdered for it. Did you see that latest Clinton adviser that got murdered about it?

22:05.560 --> 22:06.720
 Yep. Yeah.

22:06.720 --> 22:13.360
 Hung with an extension cord, shot himself in the chest 30 miles from his house, and they're calling it a suicide.

22:13.360 --> 22:17.040
 And now even Elon Musk is asking, where's the clientele list?

22:17.040 --> 22:20.760
 Yeah, we should we should probably see who's been to that island.

22:20.760 --> 22:23.240
 Yeah, we should probably see who's been to that island.

22:23.240 --> 22:29.080
 And there's probably more of those kind of things out there that haven't been exposed.

22:29.080 --> 22:35.840
 Yeah, but sort of to push back in you, you had those conversations with Alex Jones.

22:35.840 --> 22:39.680
 Wouldn't you be able to have the same kind of conversation with Donald Trump?

22:39.680 --> 22:40.200
 That's the problem.

22:40.200 --> 22:42.120
 Reveal. No, it's not the problem.

22:42.120 --> 22:44.800
 You revealed that Alex Jones is a human being.

22:44.800 --> 22:47.480
 Yeah, he's fucked up. He has demons in his head.

22:47.480 --> 22:54.520
 He's obviously chaotic all over the place, but there's some wisdom to the perspective he takes on the world.

22:54.520 --> 23:02.520
 Even though he is often full of shit, he is able to predict certain things that very few people are willing to bring up.

23:02.520 --> 23:04.120
 So isn't Trump the same way?

23:04.120 --> 23:10.000
 Fucked up person, egomaniac, whatever personality things you can talk about.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.440
 Isn't it worthwhile to lay it out?

23:12.440 --> 23:19.280
 Like, who's going to, if you listen to interviews of Trump, who has the balls to call him out on this bullshit?

23:19.280 --> 23:21.200
 Chris Wallace did.

23:21.200 --> 23:25.000
 No, calling out somebody on their bullshit is easy when you're just being adversarial.

23:25.000 --> 23:31.840
 But as a person who is genuinely and pathetically trying to understand, I think you're really good at that.

23:31.840 --> 23:32.960
 Like, you pull them in.

23:32.960 --> 23:36.400
 I don't know if he would genuinely be there.

23:36.400 --> 23:37.360
 You know what I'm saying?

23:37.360 --> 23:39.800
 Like, I think he would be putting on a performance.

23:39.800 --> 23:42.800
 You don't think he can break through that in like 30 minutes?

23:42.800 --> 23:44.800
 I'd need more time than that.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.480
 And he doesn't do any drugs.

23:46.480 --> 23:47.760
 That's the thing about Alex.

23:47.760 --> 23:53.000
 You can get Alex high, get him drunk, and he'll start talking about interdimensional child molesters.

23:53.000 --> 23:53.480
 Yeah.

23:53.480 --> 23:56.160
 You know, and then you get the real Alex.

23:56.160 --> 24:01.440
 Or maybe you have somebody else on as well to introduce chaos, like Alex.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.520
 No, no, no, no.

24:02.520 --> 24:03.240
 You have to be one of them.

24:03.240 --> 24:05.120
 I would have to be just me and him.

24:05.120 --> 24:07.080
 I would have to, that would be a focused thing.

24:07.080 --> 24:11.240
 I would have to, like, really take time with Trump.

24:11.240 --> 24:20.360
 But also, I'm not well versed enough politically to know all of the corruption that's been alleged

24:20.360 --> 24:25.920
 and to understand what the whole Russiagate stuff, what's real.

24:25.920 --> 24:32.920
 Like, how much of it, it's clear that there is more than one organization that's involved

24:32.920 --> 24:36.560
 in communicating with Russia before the 2016 election.

24:36.560 --> 24:40.800
 So it's pretty clear that the Clinton administration was involved.

24:40.800 --> 24:45.920
 It's pretty clear that the Trump administration had some communication with some people in Russia.

24:45.920 --> 24:51.320
 It's pretty clear that Hunter Biden had some very suspicious dealings in Ukraine.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.840
 And there's a lot going on there, man.

24:53.840 --> 24:57.640
 And it's hard for anybody to parse.

24:57.640 --> 25:05.840
 It's really hard for anybody, and especially to have an objective assessment of exactly what's going on.

25:05.840 --> 25:09.160
 And then to be able to do that and broadcast it publicly.

25:09.160 --> 25:10.680
 That's quite a project.

25:10.680 --> 25:16.600
 And I think if you really want to do that correctly, it's something that I would have to research for a long time.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.640
 And to really, really, and I don't have that kind of time.

25:19.640 --> 25:24.240
 Not for, maybe for certain people that you're really curious about.

25:24.240 --> 25:26.200
 Like, you have that kind of time for Bob Lazar.

25:26.200 --> 25:28.200
 Yes, yes.

25:28.200 --> 25:29.640
 But maybe not for Donald Trump.

25:29.640 --> 25:30.840
 No, that's different.

25:30.840 --> 25:38.200
 Because Bob Lazar, what he's talking about, I wanted to know, with the Bob Lazar thing,

25:38.200 --> 25:42.160
 I wanted to know, first of all, I want to be around him and see if I could smell bullshit.

25:42.160 --> 25:42.720
 Did you?

25:42.720 --> 25:43.720
 No.

25:43.720 --> 25:44.200
 OK.

25:44.200 --> 25:45.040
 No, I didn't, man.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.560
 That was what's weird about it.

25:46.560 --> 25:51.040
 Not only did I not smell bullshit, I went over all of his interviews.

25:51.040 --> 25:54.560
 He hasn't done a lot, but he's done enough.

25:54.560 --> 25:57.880
 And he's done them over the course of 30 plus years.

25:57.880 --> 26:04.440
 And it's alarming how consistent his story is, which is really weird when you think about,

26:04.440 --> 26:11.080
 you're talking about back engineering alien crafts and working on a top secret government

26:11.080 --> 26:18.000
 test site that's carved into the side of a mountain to camouflage it from satellites.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.600
 It's such a wacky story.

26:20.600 --> 26:23.760
 But the guy really did work at Los Alamos Labs.

26:23.760 --> 26:25.800
 He really is a propulsions expert.

26:25.800 --> 26:29.280
 He really is a scientist.

26:29.280 --> 26:31.760
 Did he really work on back engineering UFOs?

26:31.760 --> 26:32.440
 I don't know.

26:32.440 --> 26:39.400
 But the way he described their motion is exactly like what's been observed by some of these pilots

26:39.400 --> 26:41.360
 that have these videos that they've captured.

26:41.360 --> 26:45.400
 And I just love that, like, NASA, I've been hearing from a bunch of folks who are there

26:45.400 --> 26:48.040
 legitimately funding research.

26:48.040 --> 26:54.840
 And there's people really taking this seriously of UFO sightings, investigating them.

26:54.840 --> 26:55.560
 Yeah.

26:55.560 --> 27:01.360
 Like, adding more and more sensors to collect data from just observing at higher and higher definitions.

27:01.360 --> 27:02.720
 It's cool to finally see that.

27:02.720 --> 27:07.280
 And he was one of the early people, whether he's full of shit or not, that kind of forced

27:07.280 --> 27:11.640
 people to start taking these topics seriously.

27:11.640 --> 27:17.840
 Or at least forced people to have conversations about them and maybe attempt to debunk them

27:17.840 --> 27:22.640
 because it seems so preposterous, but then get sucked down the rabbit hole and start going,

27:22.640 --> 27:23.880
 hmm, maybe.

27:23.880 --> 27:24.840
 We'll fucking.

27:24.840 --> 27:29.000
 The thing is, like the Fermi paradox, like, where are they, right?

27:29.000 --> 27:36.200
 And when you take into account just the sheer raw numbers, the vast majority of people objectively

27:36.200 --> 27:40.920
 assume that there is life out there, the vast majority.

27:40.920 --> 27:45.880
 Well, if you really take into account what we understand about the universe itself, what we

27:45.880 --> 27:50.840
 understand about the concept of infinity, and the way Neil deGrasse Tyson has explained it to me,

27:50.840 --> 27:57.720
 is that not only are there life forms out there, but there's you.

27:57.720 --> 27:58.520
 You are out there.

27:58.520 --> 28:05.000
 Infinity is so large that Lex Friedman exists, and doesn't just exist, but exists an infinite

28:05.000 --> 28:11.160
 number of times, like the amount of interactions at cells and molecules.

28:11.160 --> 28:17.720
 The same exact interactions that have happened here on Earth have happened in the exact same

28:17.720 --> 28:21.960
 order an infinite number of times in the cosmos.

28:21.960 --> 28:25.000
 Well, first of all, it's not certain that that's true.

28:25.000 --> 28:25.560
 It's possible.

28:25.560 --> 28:26.520
 It's possible.

28:26.520 --> 28:33.400
 Like Sean Carroll, you know, especially with quantum mechanics, based on a certain interpretation

28:33.400 --> 28:35.800
 of quantum mechanics, that's very possible.

28:35.800 --> 28:40.280
 But the question is, can you access those universes?

28:40.280 --> 28:40.600
 Right.

28:40.600 --> 28:41.720
 How far away are they?

28:41.720 --> 28:47.400
 The more sort of specific, practical question is, this local pocket of the universe,

28:47.400 --> 28:51.640
 our galaxy, or our neighboring galaxies, are there aliens there?

28:51.640 --> 28:53.080
 What do they look like?

28:53.080 --> 29:01.560
 Are they, so you can have this panspermia idea, where a much larger, like daddy civilization,

29:03.160 --> 29:08.200
 like rolled by and just planted a few aliens at a similar time.

29:08.200 --> 29:09.240
 Like Prometheus.

29:09.240 --> 29:12.680
 Yes, a different, you know, throughout the galaxy.

29:12.680 --> 29:14.840
 And those are the ones we might be interacting with.

29:14.840 --> 29:21.560
 They're all kind of dumb as we are relatively, you know, maybe a few million years apart.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.480
 And then those are the ones we're interacting with.

29:23.480 --> 29:26.920
 And then we have a chance to actually connect with them and communicate with them.

29:26.920 --> 29:29.960
 Or it could be like much more wide open.

29:29.960 --> 29:35.080
 And you have these gigantic alien civilizations that are expanding very, very quickly.

29:35.080 --> 29:39.400
 And the interesting thing is when you look up at the sky and you see the stars, that's

29:39.400 --> 29:42.120
 light from those stars.

29:42.120 --> 29:48.120
 We might not be seeing the alien civilizations until they're already here, meaning like you

29:48.120 --> 29:52.200
 start expanding, once you get really good at expanding, you're going to be expanding

29:52.200 --> 29:53.960
 very close to the speed of light.

29:53.960 --> 29:58.760
 So right now we don't see much in the sky, but there could be one day we wake up and

29:58.760 --> 30:01.960
 it's just like everywhere and they're here.

30:01.960 --> 30:02.440
 Right.

30:02.440 --> 30:04.680
 Because the amount of time the light takes to reach us.

30:04.680 --> 30:11.720
 Yeah, and then the thing that I've been really fascinated by is these, you know,

30:11.720 --> 30:18.040
 these alternative forms of transportation that they're discussing, like the ability

30:18.040 --> 30:26.280
 to harness wormholes and the ability to do things that a type three civilization is capable

30:26.280 --> 30:26.440
 of.

30:26.440 --> 30:29.000
 I had Michio Kaku on my podcast recently.

30:29.000 --> 30:29.720
 Fantastic.

30:29.720 --> 30:30.760
 Love that guy.

30:30.760 --> 30:40.040
 He's so good at taking extremely complex concepts and boiling them down for digestion.

30:40.040 --> 30:44.680
 And, you know, and saying them in a way that other people can appreciate and not being

30:44.680 --> 30:50.280
 hesitant about saying wild, crazy shit that's out there, but grounded in what's actually

30:50.280 --> 30:51.000
 possible.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.800
 Yeah, he's all in on this UFO phenomenon.

30:53.800 --> 30:58.440
 Now he's like, now the burden of proof is to people for people to come up with some

30:58.440 --> 31:01.960
 sort of a conventional explanation for these things.

31:01.960 --> 31:07.480
 He goes, because these things are defying all the concepts of physics that we currently

31:07.480 --> 31:13.160
 know in terms of what our capabilities are and propulsion systems and so many other things

31:13.160 --> 31:18.520
 that, you know, what we know about what current science is capable of reproducing.

31:18.520 --> 31:26.440
 As far as what we know, the problem is like these military projects that are top secret,

31:27.000 --> 31:28.440
 like how much money do they have?

31:28.440 --> 31:29.800
 They have a lot of money.

31:29.800 --> 31:32.760
 Like, but is it possible?

31:32.760 --> 31:34.360
 And maybe you could speak to this.

31:34.360 --> 31:41.800
 Is it possible that there could be some propulsion systems that have been developed and implemented

31:41.800 --> 31:47.960
 that are far beyond just the simple burning of rocket fuel, pushing the fire out the back,

31:47.960 --> 31:51.480
 which forces the rocket at extreme speeds forward.

31:51.480 --> 31:58.120
 That's something that does harness gravity, something that can distort space and time

31:58.120 --> 32:04.760
 and can make travel from one point to another like preposterously fast.

32:05.320 --> 32:12.280
 Well, not only is it possible, I think it's likely that that kind of stuff would be kept

32:12.280 --> 32:12.920
 a secret.

32:12.920 --> 32:13.240
 Yeah.

32:13.240 --> 32:19.800
 It's just everything you see about these, about the way either if it's contractors

32:19.800 --> 32:25.320
 like Lockheed Martin or if it's DOD, the actual departments of defense, they operate

32:25.320 --> 32:26.600
 in complete secrecy.

32:26.600 --> 32:32.280
 Just even looking at the history of the stealth fighter, just even stealth technology was

32:32.280 --> 32:39.720
 kept a secret for a very, very long time and not until you're ready to use it and need

32:39.720 --> 32:43.400
 to use it, does it become public and not officially public.

32:43.400 --> 32:45.800
 It just is being detected out in the wild.

32:46.360 --> 32:51.400
 So there's going to be a process where you're secretly testing it and that might creep up,

32:51.400 --> 32:53.240
 which is maybe what we're seeing.

32:53.240 --> 32:59.560
 And then it's waiting for the next big war, the next big reason to use the thing.

32:59.560 --> 33:00.280
 Yeah.

33:00.280 --> 33:03.080
 And so, yeah, there's definitely technologies in that.

33:03.080 --> 33:05.240
 There might not be propulsion technologies.

33:05.240 --> 33:07.720
 There could be AI surveillance technologies.

33:07.720 --> 33:12.040
 There could be different kinds of stealth drones.

33:14.360 --> 33:20.040
 It could be also in cyberspace like cyber war weapons, all that kind of stuff.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.640
 They're obviously going to be kept secret.

33:21.640 --> 33:25.000
 Yeah, I'm very skeptical lately.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.840
 And the reason why I'm skeptical is the government keeps talking about it.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.680
 The Pentagon keeps talking about it.

33:30.680 --> 33:32.360
 NASA keeps talking about it.

33:32.360 --> 33:33.960
 In which direction are you skeptical?

33:33.960 --> 33:36.280
 I'm skeptical that they're aliens.

33:36.280 --> 33:38.680
 I think most likely it's a smoke screen.

33:38.680 --> 33:43.400
 And most likely these are some sort of like incredibly advanced drones that they've developed

33:43.400 --> 33:46.600
 that they want to pretend don't exist.

33:47.160 --> 33:49.160
 That seems the more likely scenario.

33:49.160 --> 33:54.040
 Because otherwise, my take is like, what's the benefit of them discussing these things?

33:54.760 --> 33:57.560
 What's the benefit of them discussing these things openly?

33:57.560 --> 34:04.440
 These are, the way they described it, off world crafts, not made from this earth.

34:06.440 --> 34:07.080
 Why?

34:07.080 --> 34:08.520
 Why would they tell us that?

34:09.160 --> 34:16.680
 Unless there's an imminent danger of us being invaded and they want to prepare people so

34:16.680 --> 34:17.960
 they don't freak out as much.

34:17.960 --> 34:20.200
 You know, like maybe freak them out a little bit.

34:20.200 --> 34:21.720
 Say that publicly.

34:21.720 --> 34:26.200
 The New York Times article, the Pentagon discussing it, all these different things.

34:26.200 --> 34:27.400
 Test the waters.

34:27.400 --> 34:35.080
 Yeah, well, let people know that this is a thing or my take is like that.

34:35.080 --> 34:36.200
 I don't think they do that.

34:36.200 --> 34:37.400
 I don't think they tell us.

34:37.960 --> 34:43.480
 I think the government has a lot of contempt for the citizens.

34:43.480 --> 34:44.200
 I really do.

34:44.200 --> 34:46.520
 I think they have contempt for our intelligence.

34:46.520 --> 34:49.480
 They have contempt for our need to know things.

34:49.480 --> 34:53.000
 And I also think they think that they are running us.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.920
 It's not we're all in this together.

34:54.920 --> 34:56.840
 And the government works for the people.

34:56.840 --> 34:58.600
 And the government is of the people.

34:58.600 --> 34:59.880
 I don't think they think that way.

34:59.880 --> 35:05.080
 Yeah, the basic idea is you can't trust the populace, the government itself, because we're

35:05.080 --> 35:05.800
 a bunch of idiots.

35:06.920 --> 35:07.880
 I think that's accurate.

35:08.760 --> 35:13.320
 Well, they're not wrong, but they're also idiots, power hungry idiots.

35:13.320 --> 35:18.280
 Yeah, I don't think everyone's an idiot, but I think there are enough idiots that it becomes

35:18.280 --> 35:21.560
 a real problem if you're completely honest about everything you do.

35:21.560 --> 35:28.040
 And you don't want to let everybody weigh in about things that are incredibly complex

35:28.040 --> 35:30.200
 and that most people are ignorant of.

35:30.200 --> 35:35.080
 And on top of that, there's this machine of intelligence that I've recently been reading

35:35.080 --> 35:37.320
 a lot about the KGB, about the FSB.

35:37.320 --> 35:40.760
 So several things sparked my curiosity.

35:40.760 --> 35:43.720
 So one, I'm traveling to Ukraine and to Moscow.

35:43.720 --> 35:49.000
 And because of that, I started to sort of ask practical questions of myself, just travel

35:49.000 --> 35:50.200
 and all those kinds of things.

35:50.200 --> 35:52.280
 So I started reading a lot about the KGB.

35:52.280 --> 35:53.960
 Jack Barsky has a book on this.

35:53.960 --> 35:54.680
 I talked to him.

35:56.280 --> 36:00.440
 And you start to realize, you probably looked into some of this, but you start to realize

36:01.000 --> 36:04.680
 the scale of surveillance, manipulation.

36:05.240 --> 36:10.200
 Now, a lot of them also talk about the incompetence of those organizations, the usual

36:10.200 --> 36:11.720
 bureaucracy creeps in.

36:11.720 --> 36:18.920
 But the point is, it seems like there's no line they're not willing to cross for the

36:18.920 --> 36:24.200
 purpose of gathering intelligence, for the purpose of controlling people in order to

36:24.200 --> 36:25.400
 gather intelligence.

36:25.400 --> 36:29.240
 Now, this is MI6, FSB.

36:30.920 --> 36:34.840
 There's not much information about the FSB or the GRU, but the KGB.

36:34.840 --> 36:39.800
 So we're always like 20 years behind or more on the actual information.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.960
 And so I started to wonder.

36:43.160 --> 36:48.920
 So I have not officially been contacted by any intelligence agency, but I started to

36:48.920 --> 36:58.040
 wonder, well, is there somebody I know that's doing that, undercover CIA or undercover

36:58.040 --> 37:00.200
 FSB, undercover anything?

37:00.200 --> 37:00.840
 You probably do.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.320
 Have you asked yourself this question?

37:03.320 --> 37:04.520
 Yeah, for sure.

37:04.520 --> 37:06.120
 Yeah, people that have been on my podcast.

37:06.680 --> 37:07.480
 Yeah, for sure.

37:07.480 --> 37:10.360
 Do you think there was actually a guess that may have been?

37:10.360 --> 37:11.240
 100%.

37:11.240 --> 37:11.800
 Oh, man.

37:11.800 --> 37:12.840
 I would imagine.

37:12.840 --> 37:13.400
 Would you know?

37:14.600 --> 37:15.720
 I have suspicions.

37:15.720 --> 37:16.680
 Do you care?

37:16.680 --> 37:17.080
 Is this?

37:18.520 --> 37:23.640
 I mean, it depends on what they're attempting to do, right?

37:23.640 --> 37:28.920
 Like if I felt like there was some deception involved and they were trying to use the podcast

37:28.920 --> 37:35.480
 to manipulate a narrative in a deceptive way to trick people into things, yeah, I would

37:35.480 --> 37:36.040
 care.

37:36.040 --> 37:38.760
 But this is exactly what, those are the kind of things they do.

37:38.760 --> 37:40.360
 They do plant narratives.

37:40.360 --> 37:40.600
 Yeah.

37:41.800 --> 37:47.400
 I mean, I would imagine if you have the number one podcast in the world that people would

37:47.400 --> 37:49.000
 want to infiltrate that.

37:49.560 --> 37:54.280
 Yeah, there's probably meetings in all major intelligence agencies about, okay, what are

37:54.280 --> 37:55.400
 the large platforms?

37:57.640 --> 37:59.720
 How do we spread the message?

37:59.720 --> 38:00.200
 Yeah.

38:00.200 --> 38:04.680
 Well, I mean, that's the thing that really emerged when we're talking about during my

38:04.680 --> 38:11.560
 cancellation, that there's a clear, there's no objective analysis of this in mainstream

38:11.560 --> 38:12.280
 media.

38:12.280 --> 38:19.720
 There's clear narratives that they're trying to push forward to, whether it's to promote

38:19.720 --> 38:27.000
 certain ideas or to diminish the power and reach of people who are mavericks or people

38:27.000 --> 38:32.840
 who aren't connected to a system that you can't compromise.

38:32.840 --> 38:34.600
 That's where it gets dangerous, right?

38:34.600 --> 38:39.320
 Where it gets dangerous is when someone has the largest reach, but is also completely

38:39.320 --> 38:49.960
 detached and clearly is independent in the sense of independent thinking, has on whoever

38:49.960 --> 38:51.000
 he wants.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
 But your mind can still be manipulated.

38:53.000 --> 38:53.960
 I guess I can.

38:53.960 --> 38:56.360
 I mean, I guess everybody can be manipulated a certain way.

38:56.360 --> 38:58.280
 I manipulate my own mind, I'm sure too.

38:58.280 --> 39:01.160
 But I also spend a lot of time thinking about what I think.

39:01.160 --> 39:07.560
 You know, I don't just accept things like the UFO thing, like I was all in for a while

39:07.560 --> 39:11.160
 and now I'm like, man, something smells fishy.

39:11.160 --> 39:15.720
 And then I'm thinking like, here's my problem with the UFO thing.

39:15.720 --> 39:18.120
 I want it to be real so bad.

39:18.120 --> 39:19.720
 That's my problem with it.

39:19.720 --> 39:20.920
 I'm such a sucker.

39:21.800 --> 39:28.280
 I want it to be real so bad, you know, and that's a problem for me because I'm aware

39:28.280 --> 39:28.760
 of it.

39:28.760 --> 39:38.360
 And so then I stop and think about like, what is my desire for UFO truth to be exposed?

39:38.360 --> 39:41.960
 Well, it's because it's fun, you know, that's what it is.

39:41.960 --> 39:44.360
 So I have a desire for it to be real.

39:44.360 --> 39:48.840
 I mean, I've talked to a bunch of folks about this.

39:48.840 --> 39:56.040
 So those with connection with DoD, and they do draw lines between people that are full

39:56.040 --> 39:58.840
 of shit and people who are not.

39:58.840 --> 40:02.120
 There's a lot of people in the public sphere that they say are full of shit.

40:02.920 --> 40:04.120
 Yeah, for sure.

40:04.120 --> 40:06.600
 And then you have to kind of tell the difference.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.680
 Yeah, CNN, watch them talk.

40:08.680 --> 40:16.280
 Well, I mean, on the UFO topic, there's certain individuals that are like, okay, they're

40:16.280 --> 40:17.400
 just like using this.

40:18.360 --> 40:23.720
 In fact, like people who are not full of shit are often very quiet, which is why, you know,

40:23.720 --> 40:27.240
 even Bob Lazar is an interesting story because he was trying to be quiet for the longest

40:27.240 --> 40:28.360
 time.

40:28.360 --> 40:32.840
 Well, he was worried about his own life, according to Bob, and that's why he went public with

40:32.840 --> 40:33.000
 it.

40:33.000 --> 40:37.480
 And initially, the first videos he did with George Knapp, they hit his identity.

40:37.480 --> 40:38.840
 Yeah, yeah.

40:38.840 --> 40:40.760
 And then he felt like that wasn't enough.

40:40.760 --> 40:47.480
 And he really needed to expose his own identity just to protect his life, which is a great

40:47.480 --> 40:48.280
 story.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.920
 You know, so you got to go, well, that seems so juicy.

40:50.920 --> 40:52.280
 I want to buy into it.

40:52.280 --> 40:53.320
 And that's where I get nervous.

40:53.320 --> 40:53.720
 You don't know.

40:53.720 --> 40:55.240
 You don't know who to trust in this world.

40:55.240 --> 40:55.880
 Exactly.

40:55.880 --> 40:57.800
 How do you figure that out?

40:57.800 --> 40:59.720
 How do you figure out who to trust in your life?

40:59.720 --> 41:00.520
 You're Joe Rogan.

41:00.520 --> 41:01.720
 A lot of people want to be close to you.

41:01.720 --> 41:06.200
 CIA agents, FSB agents, people that want to.

41:06.200 --> 41:10.360
 I'm friends with a former CIA agent, Mike Baker, who's been on my podcast a bunch of

41:10.360 --> 41:10.680
 times.

41:10.680 --> 41:11.880
 Allegedly former.

41:11.880 --> 41:12.360
 Former.

41:12.360 --> 41:12.920
 Think about that.

41:12.920 --> 41:14.040
 He's air quotes, former.

41:14.040 --> 41:14.440
 Yeah.

41:14.440 --> 41:16.040
 Yeah, I don't believe he's former.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.720
 I'm sure he has some connection to him.

41:17.720 --> 41:24.040
 I also believe he's a good guy, but I gain a lot of very intelligent and well informed

41:24.040 --> 41:26.200
 insights from him as to how things work.

41:26.200 --> 41:32.920
 And, you know, I think, yeah, I'm sure he doesn't tell me everything about everything,

41:32.920 --> 41:40.280
 but he's told me enough where I think I can understand things better from talking to him

41:40.280 --> 41:46.280
 about how the way, you know, the elves work under the machine.

41:46.280 --> 41:47.640
 What about friends?

41:47.640 --> 41:49.000
 How do you know if you can trust?

41:49.000 --> 41:50.440
 Well, most of my friends are old friends.

41:51.320 --> 41:51.800
 Time.

41:51.800 --> 41:52.840
 So time is the thing.

41:52.840 --> 41:53.400
 Yeah.

41:53.400 --> 41:56.040
 Like just going through shit together.

41:56.040 --> 41:56.280
 Yeah.

41:56.280 --> 42:00.120
 And also people that, you know, first of all, comics.

42:01.480 --> 42:02.520
 You can trust comics?

42:02.520 --> 42:03.160
 Yeah.

42:03.160 --> 42:04.920
 Comics are pretty trustworthy.

42:04.920 --> 42:06.840
 The good ones, the really good ones.

42:06.840 --> 42:08.040
 There's not that many of us.

42:08.920 --> 42:13.960
 If there's a thousand professional comics on earth, I'd be stunned.

42:14.600 --> 42:15.320
 I'd be stunned.

42:15.320 --> 42:19.880
 I don't even think there's a thousand like real professionals who you get booked all

42:19.880 --> 42:24.200
 the time, headline weekends at clubs and theaters and arenas.

42:25.080 --> 42:26.840
 And then there's levels to that, right?

42:26.840 --> 42:32.440
 There's like the guys who are middle acts who kind of like barely scraped by and then

42:32.440 --> 42:34.040
 like how many headliners are there?

42:34.040 --> 42:37.480
 How many like really funny headliners that I would say, you know, if you Lex, you tell

42:37.480 --> 42:39.320
 me you're going to be in Cincinnati.

42:39.320 --> 42:41.080
 Hey, this person's playing at this club.

42:41.080 --> 42:42.360
 Should I go see them?

42:42.360 --> 42:47.240
 I'd be like, you know, like how many people would I give the recommendation to?

42:47.800 --> 42:50.360
 And then how many people sell out theaters?

42:50.920 --> 42:52.920
 How many people sell out arenas?

42:52.920 --> 42:53.400
 How many people?

42:53.400 --> 42:55.000
 There's not that fucking many.

42:55.000 --> 43:00.680
 So those people like at the levels of comedy where you do, you know, you've been doing

43:00.680 --> 43:02.120
 stand up for 20 years.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.840
 There's a certain amount of honesty and a certain amount of understanding of each other

43:06.840 --> 43:07.720
 that we all have.

43:07.720 --> 43:11.640
 Oh, so that process of becoming a great comic is like humbling in a way.

43:11.640 --> 43:13.080
 Like Jiu Jitsu is humbling.

43:13.080 --> 43:14.040
 Very similar.

43:14.040 --> 43:21.400
 Like you've eaten so much shit that that somehow, even if you're insane, even if you're chaotic,

43:21.400 --> 43:26.680
 even in the way, even if you're full of shit, you lie a lot, all those kinds of things,

43:26.680 --> 43:28.920
 underneath it, there's a good human.

43:28.920 --> 43:32.680
 You could be surface bullshitter, but on important things, you're trustworthy.

43:33.560 --> 43:34.520
 Hopefully.

43:34.520 --> 43:37.000
 I mean, if you're not, then people shy away from you.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.240
 And there are people like that, too, that are really successful, but that are what I

43:41.240 --> 43:42.040
 call islands.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.600
 I've talked to other comics about that, like you don't want to be an island because there's

43:46.600 --> 43:50.280
 these people that aren't attached to the rest of the community and they're doing well on

43:50.280 --> 43:50.760
 their own.

43:51.320 --> 43:55.160
 And usually they have like one opening act they bring with them on the road they've worked

43:55.160 --> 43:58.520
 with forever and they don't have comedy friends.

43:59.160 --> 44:03.400
 And those people are miserable because they can't relate.

44:03.400 --> 44:05.960
 Sometimes fame in itself is isolating.

44:05.960 --> 44:09.960
 So you have to actually do a lot of work and make sure you don't, it doesn't isolate you.

44:09.960 --> 44:14.200
 Because if you become successful, people start wanting stuff from you.

44:14.920 --> 44:19.160
 And then sometimes you want to push them away because of that, as opposed to connect with

44:19.160 --> 44:19.640
 them.

44:19.640 --> 44:21.800
 Yeah, I don't enjoy it when people want things from me.

44:22.600 --> 44:23.320
 It's not fun.

44:23.320 --> 44:24.440
 You just ignore it.

44:24.440 --> 44:26.440
 Yeah, it's fucking too heavy.

44:26.440 --> 44:27.480
 They want too much.

44:27.480 --> 44:31.240
 And it's too much of a disproportionate relationship.

44:32.280 --> 44:33.560
 It's too unbalanced.

44:34.280 --> 44:39.880
 Because there are people where you could tell that they're working toward something.

44:39.880 --> 44:45.640
 They're working towards an angle and they want to be close to you because you will benefit

44:45.640 --> 44:46.200
 them.

44:46.200 --> 44:49.960
 And then there's other people that are just, there's not that many of us.

44:49.960 --> 44:51.960
 And so we all want to hang out together.

44:51.960 --> 44:56.760
 Like when I, one of the podcasts I love the most is this podcast I do called Protect Our

44:56.760 --> 44:57.560
 Parks.

44:57.560 --> 45:01.080
 It's a thing I do with Ari Shaffir, Shane Gillis and Mark Nolen.

45:01.080 --> 45:01.800
 It's great.

45:01.800 --> 45:06.920
 It's so fun because we just get obliterated and we talk so much shit.

45:06.920 --> 45:10.520
 Like there's conversations after that podcast where I go, hey man, we got to cut that part

45:10.520 --> 45:14.520
 out because like Shane will go too far or go too crazy.

45:14.520 --> 45:17.800
 But we're just making each other laugh and it's just fun.

45:17.800 --> 45:22.440
 And it's like that kind of camaraderie between real comics is very precious to me.

45:22.440 --> 45:25.800
 My favorite part of that is like the non sequitur stuff from Mark Norman.

45:26.440 --> 45:29.960
 And you guys get so trashed that you don't even understand what the hell he's talking

45:29.960 --> 45:30.120
 about.

45:30.120 --> 45:33.000
 But it's funny to the listener because he's still on point.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.360
 That guy is sharp.

45:34.360 --> 45:35.400
 He's so good.

45:35.400 --> 45:37.400
 Mitch Hedberg quality.

45:37.400 --> 45:38.280
 Yes.

45:38.280 --> 45:41.400
 Well, he's such a dedicated comic.

45:41.400 --> 45:43.320
 He loves comedy so much.

45:43.320 --> 45:44.680
 That's one of the things I love about him.

45:44.680 --> 45:45.960
 He's like comedy.

45:45.960 --> 45:47.400
 He gets excited.

45:47.400 --> 45:48.440
 He loves it.

45:48.440 --> 45:50.040
 As does Shane and as does Ari.

45:50.840 --> 45:51.720
 They really love it.

45:53.560 --> 45:54.600
 So there's that.

45:54.600 --> 45:59.480
 Like I have friends in that way and I have martial arts friends who are some of the also

45:59.480 --> 46:03.480
 the thing about being humbled, how things like Jiu Jitsu will humble you.

46:03.480 --> 46:10.920
 Martial arts friends, they know who's been through it.

46:11.480 --> 46:17.640
 They know who really has gone through the gauntlet and emerged on the other end a better

46:17.640 --> 46:18.360
 person.

46:18.360 --> 46:20.120
 Well, you said there's very few of us.

46:20.680 --> 46:22.120
 Let's have the goat discussion.

46:22.120 --> 46:25.800
 You're not going to pick anybody, but who are the greats of comedy?

46:27.240 --> 46:29.240
 Who's the greatest comic of all time?

46:29.240 --> 46:31.720
 I don't think there is a greatest comic of all time.

46:31.720 --> 46:33.480
 Is it Norm Macdonald?

46:34.280 --> 46:36.760
 Norm Macdonald was one of the greats for sure.

46:36.760 --> 46:41.080
 Well, by the way, actually on that topic, what do you think about is I think as a person

46:41.080 --> 46:47.320
 who is fascinated by the fear of death and death, I think it was a truly genius thing

46:47.320 --> 46:49.400
 to release a special after you're dead.

46:50.360 --> 46:51.240
 I don't know how that works.

46:51.240 --> 46:52.440
 I haven't seen the special of you.

46:53.000 --> 46:57.240
 Yeah, it's called I think nothing special.

46:58.680 --> 47:00.760
 Which sounds like something Norm would say.

47:00.760 --> 47:04.200
 And it's basically him in front of...

47:04.200 --> 47:10.120
 I mean, I imagine he wouldn't have wanted it edited that way because it's made to look

47:10.120 --> 47:12.280
 nicer than I think he probably would have preferred it.

47:13.160 --> 47:21.560
 But it's him in front of the screen like in a Zoom call doing jokes without cold.

47:21.560 --> 47:22.040
 Really?

47:22.040 --> 47:22.680
 Yeah.

47:22.680 --> 47:29.320
 And somehow given his like dry, dark humor, it works.

47:29.320 --> 47:31.560
 Because it's almost making fun of itself.

47:31.560 --> 47:36.440
 Almost making fun of that hole that we were stuck alone inside.

47:37.400 --> 47:42.440
 And because he's still acting as if he's in front of the audience and is almost making

47:42.440 --> 47:44.920
 fun of the fact that this is what we're forced to do.

47:44.920 --> 47:46.040
 I mean, it's quite genius.

47:46.040 --> 47:46.680
 It's really well...

47:46.680 --> 47:48.520
 And the jokes are really good.

47:48.520 --> 47:52.280
 But it also makes you realize how important laughter is from the audience, the energy

47:52.280 --> 47:53.080
 from the audience.

47:54.680 --> 47:58.920
 But there's also an intimacy because it's just you and him because you're listening

47:58.920 --> 48:01.000
 into it, there's no audience.

48:01.000 --> 48:04.040
 So that's, I don't know, I think it's quite genius.

48:04.040 --> 48:10.040
 And he is, of course, there's certain comics that are like, not only are they funny, but

48:10.040 --> 48:11.640
 they're truly unique.

48:12.680 --> 48:20.280
 And they're not in terms of friendship and all that kind of stuff, but in terms of comedy,

48:20.280 --> 48:21.640
 they're an island.

48:21.640 --> 48:24.440
 It's like they, you know, Mitch Hedberg probably is that.

48:24.440 --> 48:27.560
 Of course, a lot of people then start to imitate them and so on.

48:27.560 --> 48:28.600
 Stephen Wright.

48:28.600 --> 48:30.600
 Stephen Wright.

48:30.600 --> 48:35.560
 I mean, there's like people who are like, you know, Dave Chappelle, who's like probably

48:35.560 --> 48:38.600
 one of the greats, but he's just like raw funny.

48:39.240 --> 48:40.440
 I don't know if he's an island.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.120
 He's just raw.

48:42.120 --> 48:43.160
 Yeah, I know what you're saying.

48:43.160 --> 48:45.320
 An outlier, a unique individual.

48:45.320 --> 48:46.280
 Yeah, he's just great.

48:47.960 --> 48:50.360
 Norm was definitely unique in his greatness.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.520
 There's only one Norm, you know, who's got a very specific style.

48:54.520 --> 48:58.840
 Is there a reason you guys weren't, it doesn't seem like he was, you guys were close.

48:58.840 --> 48:59.880
 I mean, I loved him.

48:59.880 --> 49:00.600
 He was great.

49:00.600 --> 49:02.120
 I always enjoyed talking to him.

49:04.120 --> 49:05.560
 We just didn't work together that often.

49:05.560 --> 49:07.160
 We weren't around each other that often.

49:07.160 --> 49:10.920
 That's all it was, but it wasn't like, it was, I loved him though.

49:11.560 --> 49:12.440
 He was a great guy.

49:12.440 --> 49:14.120
 I had a funny story about it, Norm.

49:15.000 --> 49:18.520
 Twice, just randomly, I was on airplanes next to him.

49:19.160 --> 49:20.200
 Seated right next to him.

49:20.200 --> 49:21.160
 Just totally random.

49:21.160 --> 49:27.160
 Yeah, and one time we're on this airplane and we're having this talk and I was like,

49:27.160 --> 49:28.760
 yeah, I quit smoking.

49:28.760 --> 49:32.760
 I was smoking a lot and I just had terrible, terrible smoke.

49:32.760 --> 49:33.800
 It's terrible for you.

49:34.440 --> 49:35.800
 And we have this great conversation.

49:35.800 --> 49:42.920
 We get off the plane and he sprints towards a store and buys cigarettes like in the airport

49:42.920 --> 49:46.040
 and is lighting it on the way out the door.

49:46.600 --> 49:48.120
 And I go, I thought you quit smoking.

49:48.120 --> 49:49.160
 It was, yeah, I did.

49:49.160 --> 49:52.120
 But all that talking about smoking made me want to smoke again.

49:54.360 --> 49:58.440
 So before he's getting through the door of the airport, he's lighting it up.

49:58.440 --> 49:59.080
 I can't wait.

50:00.920 --> 50:02.760
 He can't wait to get that cigarette in him.

50:02.760 --> 50:08.360
 It was, he was just so crazy and impulsive and loved to gamble.

50:08.360 --> 50:09.880
 He loved gambling.

50:09.880 --> 50:12.440
 And in that way, he embodied the joke.

50:12.440 --> 50:20.920
 You can't even tell that certain people just live in a non sequitur, ridiculous, absurd,

50:20.920 --> 50:21.720
 funny way.

50:21.720 --> 50:22.520
 Yeah, that was him.

50:23.640 --> 50:24.200
 Nonstop.

50:24.920 --> 50:27.080
 There was nothing artificial about Norm.

50:28.200 --> 50:29.240
 That was who he was.

50:29.880 --> 50:33.000
 His brilliance was his essence.

50:33.000 --> 50:33.880
 That was who he was.

50:35.240 --> 50:40.760
 But in terms of the greats, the godfather of it all is Lenny Bruce.

50:40.760 --> 50:46.200
 I mean, I have a bunch of Lenny Bruce concert posters at my house and photos that I have

50:46.200 --> 50:50.520
 framed and Whitney Cummings actually gave me this brilliant photo of him when he got

50:50.520 --> 50:54.920
 arrested for one of the times when he got arrested for saying obscene jokes.

50:55.880 --> 51:02.760
 He was the most important figure in the early days of comedy because he essentially gave

51:02.760 --> 51:05.720
 birth to the modern art form of standup comedy.

51:05.720 --> 51:10.760
 Before that, it was a bunch of guys that were like hosting shows and they would tell jokes.

51:10.760 --> 51:15.400
 They were just like, you know, two guys walking to a bar, that kind of stuff.

51:15.960 --> 51:21.400
 And he would talk about social issues.

51:21.400 --> 51:23.080
 You know, he would talk about life.

51:23.080 --> 51:24.520
 He would talk about language.

51:24.520 --> 51:26.520
 He would talk about laws.

51:27.240 --> 51:33.720
 And it was just he was the very first guy who did modern standup.

51:33.720 --> 51:40.440
 And what's fascinating is if you go and you try to watch it, if you try to watch Lenny

51:40.440 --> 51:45.640
 Bruce today, it doesn't work because society has evolved.

51:45.640 --> 51:53.480
 Like in many ways, art is a window, especially like pop culture or modern, you know, at the

51:53.480 --> 52:01.560
 time, culture, art, art that discusses culture is a window into that time period.

52:01.560 --> 52:03.320
 It's a little bit of a time machine.

52:03.320 --> 52:08.520
 So you get to like, you have to put yourself like, what was it like to be in 1963?

52:08.520 --> 52:10.440
 Like, what was he in 1963?

52:10.440 --> 52:12.680
 What was this like to hear him say this?

52:13.480 --> 52:20.760
 And the civilization that existed in 1963, although it looked pretty similar, they're

52:20.760 --> 52:24.280
 all driving cars and they're all wearing suits and they're all it seems normal.

52:24.280 --> 52:26.200
 That's a it's a different world.

52:27.000 --> 52:33.160
 And the things that he was saying that are so taboo are so normal today that they're

52:33.160 --> 52:34.360
 not shocking.

52:34.360 --> 52:36.440
 And it's not not that good.

52:36.440 --> 52:37.400
 It's not that funny.

52:37.400 --> 52:42.600
 Yeah, you have to do the same kind of stuff for like there's a D.H. Lawrence has a book

52:42.600 --> 52:44.680
 called Lady Chatterley's Lover.

52:45.480 --> 52:49.080
 And I know it sounds ridiculous, but it was one of the early books, I believe, at the

52:50.920 --> 52:54.920
 over a century ago that was very controversial for its sexual content.

52:54.920 --> 53:00.120
 It's sort of one of the great books because it dared to actually talk about a woman cheating

53:00.120 --> 53:04.680
 on her husband and like and do so in the highest form.

53:04.680 --> 53:09.080
 And the same thing with Gulag Archipelago talking about talking about some of the darkest

53:09.080 --> 53:14.920
 aspects of human history right when all of that stuff is forbidden, when it's banned.

53:14.920 --> 53:18.760
 Because now it's like not, you know, yes, we all know this history.

53:18.760 --> 53:23.000
 But when in the middle of it, when you're risking your own life, when you're risking

53:23.000 --> 53:28.360
 your book being banned or burned or you being in prison, that's when it matters, like taking

53:28.360 --> 53:29.320
 that risk.

53:29.320 --> 53:29.800
 Yeah.

53:29.800 --> 53:32.440
 And no one took that risk more than Lenny Bruce.

53:32.440 --> 53:34.920
 Lenny Bruce was arrested many, many times.

53:34.920 --> 53:39.160
 And ultimately, it wound up costing him his life.

53:39.160 --> 53:44.680
 I mean, he died on the bathroom floor shooting heroin and trying to cope with all the lawsuits

53:44.680 --> 53:45.720
 that he was going through.

53:45.720 --> 53:50.040
 This guy was constantly being arrested and constantly going through lawsuits.

53:50.040 --> 53:53.000
 And then his comedy deteriorated horribly.

53:53.000 --> 53:57.160
 There's some footage of him towards the end of his career where he's essentially would

53:57.160 --> 54:00.840
 go on stage with legal papers and read from the legal papers about his case.

54:01.640 --> 54:03.320
 From then, it's Richard Pryor.

54:03.320 --> 54:05.720
 From him, then the next great is Richard Pryor.

54:05.720 --> 54:08.680
 And he had the most profound impact on me when I was a kid.

54:09.240 --> 54:14.040
 When I was 15 years old, my parents took me to see Live at the Sunset Strip, which is

54:14.040 --> 54:15.800
 Richard Pryor's concert film.

54:15.800 --> 54:23.800
 And I remember very distinctly being in that audience and laughing and looking around at

54:23.800 --> 54:29.800
 all the people in the audience who were like falling out of their chairs, just dying, laughing,

54:29.800 --> 54:32.200
 just swaying back and forth.

54:32.200 --> 54:33.560
 And I was laughing hard, too.

54:33.560 --> 54:37.160
 And I was like, my God, this guy is doing this just by talking.

54:37.160 --> 54:41.080
 And I thought of all the great movies that I'd seen that I love that were hilarious comedy

54:41.080 --> 54:41.480
 movies.

54:42.040 --> 54:45.400
 And I was like, nothing that I've ever seen is as funny as this.

54:45.400 --> 54:46.920
 And all he's doing is talking.

54:46.920 --> 54:53.640
 And that planted a seed in my head for my love of stand up comedy and my curiosity about

54:53.640 --> 54:54.440
 the art form.

54:54.440 --> 54:59.720
 And that's what got me interested in watching it on television and then ultimately going

54:59.720 --> 55:02.840
 to open mic nights and then eventually doing it.

55:03.400 --> 55:07.160
 I've actually been going to open mics a lot recently, just listening.

55:07.160 --> 55:10.200
 For psychological examinations of people.

55:10.200 --> 55:16.840
 No, it's actually really inspiring to me to see people that somewhere in the world

55:16.840 --> 55:23.800
 some are funny, some are not so funny, unapologetically trying, putting it all out there night after

55:23.800 --> 55:26.200
 night, like eating shit.

55:27.240 --> 55:34.680
 My favorite is when you're talking about five people in the audience and the jokes are just

55:34.680 --> 55:35.400
 not landing.

55:36.920 --> 55:43.480
 And they still, I don't know, it feels like even just empathetically, there's few things

55:43.480 --> 55:44.840
 as difficult as that.

55:44.840 --> 55:45.400
 It's hard.

55:45.400 --> 55:50.200
 I still remember those days, many comics will say this, and I think Dane Cook was the first

55:50.200 --> 55:54.920
 person I heard say it publicly, that if he ever had to go back and do it again, like

55:54.920 --> 55:56.600
 from scratch, doesn't think he could do it.

55:56.600 --> 56:04.440
 Doesn't think he could endure the struggle of open mic to ultimately to success.

56:04.440 --> 56:11.320
 And the numbers of people that try it and fail versus try and succeed are off the charts.

56:11.320 --> 56:15.800
 I don't know if there's any other art form that has such a low rate of success.

56:16.840 --> 56:18.840
 Because it's psychological, it's torture.

56:18.840 --> 56:21.080
 It is torture, and it's also not something you can learn.

56:22.120 --> 56:27.240
 Like, here's the thing, like, if you play guitar, you can learn to play guitar.

56:27.960 --> 56:33.240
 Someone can teach you the chords, and if you do it, you could do all along the watchtower,

56:33.240 --> 56:34.040
 you could play it.

56:35.080 --> 56:37.880
 You can't teach someone how to do comedy.

56:37.880 --> 56:39.400
 You think it's you're funny or not?

56:39.400 --> 56:44.600
 You think it's you're funny or not, or can you still figure it out?

56:44.600 --> 56:45.480
 Like, can you still learn?

56:45.480 --> 56:47.000
 You can figure it out, yeah.

56:47.000 --> 56:51.480
 Can you start being unfunny and become funny?

56:51.480 --> 56:53.160
 Yes, it's possible.

56:53.160 --> 56:54.680
 It's not easy, though.

56:54.680 --> 56:56.360
 You're gonna have to eat a lot of shit.

56:56.360 --> 56:59.400
 You're gonna have to eat a lot of shit, and you're gonna have to examine why you're not

56:59.400 --> 57:05.400
 funny, and you're gonna have to spend a lot of time with uncomfortable thoughts and try

57:05.400 --> 57:07.320
 to figure out what it is.

57:07.320 --> 57:08.200
 Like, what's missing?

57:08.200 --> 57:11.480
 Like, you know, could you edit your stuff and make it better?

57:12.520 --> 57:14.440
 Maybe you need to do drugs.

57:14.440 --> 57:19.560
 Maybe you need to get involved in psychedelic drugs and rethink the way you interface with

57:19.560 --> 57:21.000
 reality itself.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.080
 Maybe you need your heart broken.

57:23.080 --> 57:24.680
 Maybe you need to be in love.

57:24.680 --> 57:26.920
 Maybe there's a lot of maybes there.

57:26.920 --> 57:29.160
 Like, maybe you just need more life experience.

57:29.160 --> 57:32.760
 But, you know, when I started comedy, I was 21, and I was a moron.

57:32.760 --> 57:35.480
 I had no information, you know?

57:35.480 --> 57:39.720
 I could do impressions of people, and I could talk about sex.

57:39.720 --> 57:43.240
 Those are the things that I was interested in back then.

57:43.240 --> 57:47.160
 I mean, if I was talking philosophically, I didn't have a philosophy.

57:47.160 --> 57:50.200
 I didn't have a unique perspective on life.

57:50.200 --> 57:51.320
 I hadn't experienced much.

57:51.320 --> 57:56.440
 So, every time you bomb, it forces you to introspect, to ask questions of yourself,

57:56.440 --> 58:00.840
 and then that's how you actually develop a philosophy of what you actually believe.

58:00.840 --> 58:05.320
 You learn through doing, and I think you could say that about podcasting, too.

58:05.320 --> 58:10.440
 You know, I'm certainly way better at having conversations than I ever was when I first

58:10.440 --> 58:11.560
 started doing comedy.

58:11.560 --> 58:13.800
 Or, excuse me, when I first started doing podcasts.

58:13.800 --> 58:14.280
 You learn through it.

58:14.280 --> 58:15.480
 You should stick with it, kid.

58:15.480 --> 58:17.720
 Because one day, you'll be able to interview Donald Trump.

58:18.440 --> 58:22.360
 You'd be mad enough to handle that conversation.

58:24.040 --> 58:25.000
 How hard is it to do?

58:25.000 --> 58:26.120
 Because I've been really curious.

58:27.240 --> 58:29.480
 It's been on my bucket list because I'm terrified.

58:29.480 --> 58:31.000
 I want to do everything I'm terrified of.

58:31.000 --> 58:32.120
 Do you want to do stand up?

58:32.120 --> 58:32.600
 No.

58:32.600 --> 58:37.240
 But I do want to do, like, one five minute, like, open mic.

58:37.240 --> 58:38.760
 Why don't you do Kill Tony?

58:38.760 --> 58:40.920
 How hard is it to do five minutes, would you say?

58:40.920 --> 58:41.480
 It's hard.

58:42.360 --> 58:46.520
 Well, it depends on, you know, how long you've been thinking about doing comedy.

58:46.520 --> 58:48.840
 It depends on how you look at things.

58:48.840 --> 58:50.680
 And also depends on your style of comedy.

58:50.680 --> 58:54.920
 Like, the most difficult style of comedy is, like, I think, like, Stephen Wright style

58:54.920 --> 58:57.000
 is probably the most difficult style of comedy.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.680
 Complete non sequiturs.

58:58.680 --> 59:00.760
 One subject doesn't lead into the next.

59:00.760 --> 59:02.120
 There's no flow to it.

59:02.120 --> 59:03.800
 It's just, oh, I noticed this.

59:03.800 --> 59:05.000
 I noticed that.

59:05.000 --> 59:05.960
 And then there's this.

59:05.960 --> 59:07.000
 And then there's that.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.880
 And that's hard to memorize.

59:09.880 --> 59:14.760
 And it's really hard to piece together an hour of non sequiturs.

59:14.760 --> 59:17.080
 But it's easier because you can rely on the joke.

59:17.960 --> 59:19.400
 It sits more with the joke.

59:20.760 --> 59:25.480
 Like, whether you're funny or not is on the actual material versus, like, the timing

59:25.480 --> 59:28.520
 and the energy of the dance with the audience, right?

59:28.520 --> 59:32.520
 Because, like, if you don't have the raw jokes like Stephen Wright does or Mitch

59:32.520 --> 59:37.320
 Hedberg, then you have to, it's all about the delivery.

59:37.320 --> 59:37.720
 Yeah.

59:37.720 --> 59:40.440
 And, yeah, they either kill or they bomb.

59:41.800 --> 59:42.760
 Is it random?

59:42.760 --> 59:44.360
 Like, whether they kill or bomb?

59:44.360 --> 59:44.600
 Yeah.

59:45.160 --> 59:49.640
 Well, I mean, you're essentially a different person every day of your life.

59:49.640 --> 59:51.320
 You know, you're similar.

59:51.960 --> 59:53.320
 But you're more tired.

59:53.880 --> 59:55.320
 You're more rested.

59:55.320 --> 59:56.760
 You're exhausted.

59:56.760 --> 59:58.120
 You're refreshed.

59:58.120 --> 1:00:01.320
 You have vitamins and food nourishment in your system.

1:00:01.320 --> 1:00:02.680
 You just got your heart broken.

1:00:02.680 --> 1:00:04.200
 You haven't slept in days.

1:00:04.200 --> 1:00:06.440
 You're a different person all the time.

1:00:06.440 --> 1:00:09.000
 And you go on to that stage.

1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:14.360
 You're in the neighborhood of who Lex Friedman is.

1:00:14.360 --> 1:00:15.720
 You're in the Lex Friedman neighborhood.

1:00:15.720 --> 1:00:17.320
 Which Lex Friedman am I going to get?

1:00:17.320 --> 1:00:17.880
 Yeah.

1:00:17.880 --> 1:00:18.360
 You know?

1:00:18.360 --> 1:00:19.400
 Energy levels.

1:00:19.400 --> 1:00:20.040
 Yeah.

1:00:20.040 --> 1:00:20.680
 It depends.

1:00:20.680 --> 1:00:21.560
 It all depends.

1:00:21.560 --> 1:00:25.480
 But, oh, the other thing with Kill Tony is it's videotaped.

1:00:25.480 --> 1:00:29.320
 Yes, so you eating shit is on there forever.

1:00:29.320 --> 1:00:29.800
 Forever.

1:00:29.800 --> 1:00:31.160
 The world can see it.

1:00:31.160 --> 1:00:33.720
 But it's one of the most important shows in comedy.

1:00:33.720 --> 1:00:36.120
 It's the most important show in comedy.

1:00:36.120 --> 1:00:43.480
 Because, first of all, it establishes stand up in a sense that, like, for the open micers,

1:00:44.120 --> 1:00:48.600
 for the people that are starting it out, it establishes that the most important thing

1:00:48.600 --> 1:00:49.560
 is to be funny.

1:00:49.560 --> 1:00:51.560
 Like, this is what the art form is all about.

1:00:51.560 --> 1:00:54.520
 And there's a lot of insecurity attached to that and a lot of fears.

1:00:54.520 --> 1:01:01.480
 And so to alleviate some of those insecurities and fears, people will decide that the message

1:01:01.480 --> 1:01:02.840
 is more important.

1:01:02.840 --> 1:01:16.520
 And they'll pretend that you have to be socially aware, that you have to promote things that

1:01:16.520 --> 1:01:19.400
 are positive in your comedy, which is bullshit.

1:01:20.120 --> 1:01:22.600
 The people that say that, they're all bad.

1:01:22.600 --> 1:01:23.960
 They're all bad at comedy.

1:01:23.960 --> 1:01:25.720
 And that's where the insecurity is.

1:01:25.720 --> 1:01:27.320
 It's like they can't just kill.

1:01:27.320 --> 1:01:30.360
 So they have to pretend that they're supposed to be socially aware.

1:01:30.360 --> 1:01:33.720
 And that being socially aware is an important part into society.

1:01:33.720 --> 1:01:36.120
 Like, let me explain something really clearly.

1:01:36.120 --> 1:01:40.760
 It's not a fucking person on earth who's ever changed their life because of a joke.

1:01:41.560 --> 1:01:42.920
 That's not what they're there for.

1:01:42.920 --> 1:01:44.120
 They're there for jokes.

1:01:44.120 --> 1:01:49.720
 The people that say that, they say that socially important comedy is the only comedy that's

1:01:49.720 --> 1:01:52.120
 necessary, the only comedy that you have to do.

1:01:52.120 --> 1:01:54.280
 That is just because they suck.

1:01:54.280 --> 1:01:55.160
 That is it.

1:01:55.160 --> 1:01:59.000
 It's like the cop out is that they can't do the real comedy.

1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:00.200
 They can't crush.

1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:05.160
 It's not like someone goes from being, you know, take like Shane Gillis, one of the best

1:02:05.160 --> 1:02:06.680
 comics up and coming right now.

1:02:06.680 --> 1:02:08.280
 He's fucking fantastic.

1:02:08.280 --> 1:02:10.840
 I can't recommend enough seeing that guy live.

1:02:10.840 --> 1:02:14.600
 I work with him in Irvine, and I hadn't seen like his whole set.

1:02:14.600 --> 1:02:15.880
 I was crying.

1:02:15.880 --> 1:02:17.080
 I mean, he's so good.

1:02:17.080 --> 1:02:18.200
 I heard he's a racist.

1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:20.840
 I haven't listened to any of his material, no.

1:02:20.840 --> 1:02:23.000
 He's so good.

1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:28.680
 And his comedy is just all just trying to be as funny as possible.

1:02:29.320 --> 1:02:33.080
 There's not a chance in hell that guy's just going to go woke and he's just going to start

1:02:33.080 --> 1:02:39.800
 promoting some sort of, you know, socially conscious agenda that's, you know, facetious

1:02:39.800 --> 1:02:46.280
 and just a bunch of nonsense that he's trying to elevate his own personal brand and virtue

1:02:46.280 --> 1:02:46.840
 signal.

1:02:46.840 --> 1:02:47.640
 That's not going to happen.

1:02:47.640 --> 1:02:53.000
 The thing about Kill Tony is in that because you only have one minute and because it's

1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:57.000
 live and because you don't want Tony shitting on you, everybody else shitting on you, everybody's

1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:59.960
 just gearing up to try to be as funny as possible.

1:02:59.960 --> 1:03:07.720
 And no one cares if you are gay or straight or Asian or black or trans or nonbinary.

1:03:07.720 --> 1:03:09.080
 Nobody gives a fuck.

1:03:09.080 --> 1:03:10.440
 Are you funny?

1:03:10.440 --> 1:03:13.240
 If you're funny, you're in and everybody loves you.

1:03:13.240 --> 1:03:14.840
 You could be 80.

1:03:14.840 --> 1:03:16.040
 You could be 20.

1:03:16.040 --> 1:03:18.360
 Nobody gives a shit.

1:03:18.360 --> 1:03:21.560
 You could be a woman or a man or ambiguous.

1:03:21.560 --> 1:03:23.160
 Nobody fucking cares.

1:03:23.160 --> 1:03:23.880
 Are you funny?

1:03:23.880 --> 1:03:29.880
 And that's the most important thing for a community of comedy to really promote comedy.

1:03:29.880 --> 1:03:31.000
 Just funny.

1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:32.200
 Just be funny.

1:03:32.200 --> 1:03:37.240
 And so in that sense, Kill Tony is a real cornerstone of comedy.

1:03:37.240 --> 1:03:39.400
 It's a reminder of what comedy is supposed to be.

1:03:39.400 --> 1:03:46.280
 That said, even the funniest stuff has underneath it some wisdom that comes out of it, but that's

1:03:46.280 --> 1:03:47.880
 not the primary goal of it.

1:03:47.880 --> 1:03:48.120
 Yeah.

1:03:48.120 --> 1:03:50.520
 I mean, it might be inspiring and fun.

1:03:50.520 --> 1:03:51.960
 Tim Dillon's a great example of that.

1:03:51.960 --> 1:03:52.680
 Yeah.

1:03:52.680 --> 1:03:58.280
 He's got some amazing insights in his comedy, but still it's fucking comedy.

1:03:58.280 --> 1:03:59.480
 It's all about the funny.

1:03:59.480 --> 1:04:00.680
 Yeah, it's all of the funny.

1:04:00.680 --> 1:04:06.600
 He's the best at doing that, especially in a podcast form about weaving really important

1:04:06.600 --> 1:04:13.640
 points in with hilarious, obviously, just jokes.

1:04:14.600 --> 1:04:19.560
 Let me ask you, speaking of Tim Dillon, a chaotic fucked up individual.

1:04:21.160 --> 1:04:22.760
 Can we go to your childhood real quick?

1:04:24.200 --> 1:04:25.080
 A brief stroll.

1:04:25.640 --> 1:04:28.200
 So your mom and dad split up when you were five.

1:04:30.040 --> 1:04:35.480
 From a younging perspective, if you look at your subconscious, what impact do you think

1:04:35.480 --> 1:04:40.360
 that had on you informing who you are as a man, as a human being?

1:04:40.360 --> 1:04:44.760
 Well, at the time I thought that my father was like a hero.

1:04:45.880 --> 1:04:46.920
 He was my dad.

1:04:46.920 --> 1:04:49.560
 I think every kid thinks like that about his dad.

1:04:49.560 --> 1:04:52.520
 His dad is like, your dad's your protector.

1:04:52.520 --> 1:04:54.440
 Your dad is like the coolest guy in the world.

1:04:54.440 --> 1:04:55.320
 That's what you like.

1:04:56.040 --> 1:04:56.680
 Yeah.

1:04:56.680 --> 1:05:00.520
 Everybody wants to be like their dad, especially if your dad is like an imposing figure.

1:05:01.080 --> 1:05:04.840
 I remember one time me and my cousin got in a fight over nothing.

1:05:04.840 --> 1:05:08.520
 It was like over who's tougher, King Kong or Godzilla.

1:05:08.520 --> 1:05:09.240
 Yeah.

1:05:09.240 --> 1:05:09.960
 Over nothing.

1:05:09.960 --> 1:05:11.480
 That's an important, but yeah.

1:05:13.240 --> 1:05:14.520
 Actual fight, actual physical fight.

1:05:14.520 --> 1:05:15.480
 I punched him in the face.

1:05:17.720 --> 1:05:19.080
 This is when you were like five?

1:05:19.080 --> 1:05:19.320
 Yeah.

1:05:20.680 --> 1:05:21.880
 Which side were you on?

1:05:21.880 --> 1:05:22.520
 King Kong.

1:05:22.520 --> 1:05:22.760
 Okay.

1:05:23.320 --> 1:05:24.360
 I was wrong.

1:05:24.360 --> 1:05:26.280
 Godzilla's like way bigger.

1:05:26.280 --> 1:05:30.440
 Godzilla's 500 feet tall and he shoots fire out of his mouth.

1:05:30.440 --> 1:05:30.680
 Yeah.

1:05:31.240 --> 1:05:32.200
 Are you sure?

1:05:32.200 --> 1:05:35.160
 I mean, there's, there's an argument to be made.

1:05:35.160 --> 1:05:37.240
 It's not all about size, right?

1:05:37.240 --> 1:05:38.920
 No, there's no argument to be made.

1:05:38.920 --> 1:05:41.080
 500 feet tall versus 50 feet tall.

1:05:41.080 --> 1:05:42.840
 One's a gigantic dinosaur.

1:05:42.840 --> 1:05:46.360
 One is a stupid monkey who gets shot down by a plane.

1:05:46.360 --> 1:05:48.200
 You don't think you can't kill Godzilla?

1:05:48.200 --> 1:05:49.800
 Godzilla, like no back.

1:05:49.800 --> 1:05:52.440
 No, you can't kill Godzilla with a plane.

1:05:54.840 --> 1:05:57.880
 Like that shit wouldn't work in Godzilla killed King Kong.

1:05:59.720 --> 1:06:02.040
 King Kong and the new movies kept growing.

1:06:02.040 --> 1:06:03.080
 It's getting bigger and bigger.

1:06:03.080 --> 1:06:05.720
 It got to the point where he's as big as Godzilla.

1:06:05.720 --> 1:06:07.640
 It just feels like King Kong is stronger.

1:06:08.520 --> 1:06:08.840
 Stop.

1:06:11.160 --> 1:06:13.720
 Backtake, backtake, immediate backtake.

1:06:13.720 --> 1:06:15.160
 You don't think there's a backtake.

1:06:15.160 --> 1:06:15.880
 There's a different.

1:06:15.880 --> 1:06:17.080
 If he's the same size.

1:06:17.080 --> 1:06:21.320
 Human weapons and two animals going at it of a different size.

1:06:21.320 --> 1:06:23.480
 You don't think there's in the jungle,

1:06:23.480 --> 1:06:25.240
 a smaller animal could take on a bigger animal.

1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:29.640
 Like a monkey versus a, let's see, a lion.

1:06:29.640 --> 1:06:30.600
 Monkey versus a bear.

1:06:31.240 --> 1:06:31.640
 What?

1:06:31.640 --> 1:06:32.200
 Who wins?

1:06:32.200 --> 1:06:33.240
 A monkey versus a bear.

1:06:33.240 --> 1:06:33.960
 Not a monkey.

1:06:33.960 --> 1:06:34.520
 Not a monkey.

1:06:34.520 --> 1:06:36.280
 What's the strongest ape?

1:06:37.720 --> 1:06:38.920
 No, but gorillas eat.

1:06:38.920 --> 1:06:39.320
 Okay.

1:06:39.320 --> 1:06:40.600
 Gorilla can't do back takes.

1:06:40.600 --> 1:06:41.880
 I'm thinking of like a smaller.

1:06:43.560 --> 1:06:44.280
 You know what I'm saying?

1:06:44.280 --> 1:06:45.960
 Because in Jiu Jitsu you see this all the time.

1:06:45.960 --> 1:06:48.040
 You remember that scene in Talladega Nights?

1:06:48.760 --> 1:06:50.200
 Do you know Talladega Nights?

1:06:50.200 --> 1:06:52.280
 Where the little boy's talking to his grandpa?

1:06:52.280 --> 1:06:54.520
 I'll be all over you like a spider monkey.

1:06:55.320 --> 1:06:55.800
 Exactly.

1:06:55.800 --> 1:06:56.360
 Spider monkey.

1:06:56.360 --> 1:06:56.840
 I was thinking.

1:06:57.560 --> 1:06:58.040
 All right.

1:06:58.040 --> 1:06:59.000
 There's some animals.

1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:00.360
 Like here's a better example.

1:07:00.360 --> 1:07:01.560
 A wolverine.

1:07:01.560 --> 1:07:04.680
 Wolverines chase wolves and bears off of their kills.

1:07:05.480 --> 1:07:06.920
 And they're not very big at all.

1:07:06.920 --> 1:07:08.840
 They're just so ferocious.

1:07:08.840 --> 1:07:10.200
 And they're so durable.

1:07:10.200 --> 1:07:12.280
 Like it's very hard to kill a wolverine.

1:07:12.280 --> 1:07:12.760
 Yeah.

1:07:12.760 --> 1:07:14.520
 And there's videos of like cats.

1:07:14.520 --> 1:07:15.560
 Like not actual cats.

1:07:15.560 --> 1:07:21.880
 Like domestic cats or domestic dogs starting shit with much larger animals.

1:07:21.880 --> 1:07:22.360
 Yeah.

1:07:22.360 --> 1:07:23.720
 And if they're ferocious enough.

1:07:24.360 --> 1:07:26.280
 Well, pit bulls are a great example of that.

1:07:26.280 --> 1:07:27.240
 Pit bulls are small.

1:07:27.240 --> 1:07:31.080
 Like real game bred pit bulls are like 35, 45 pounds.

1:07:31.080 --> 1:07:33.560
 And they'll kill much larger dogs.

1:07:34.120 --> 1:07:36.280
 Anyway, you were on King Kong's side.

1:07:36.280 --> 1:07:36.520
 Yeah.

1:07:36.520 --> 1:07:37.720
 So shit out of your cousin.

1:07:37.720 --> 1:07:41.560
 I remember he said to me like I thought it was in like real trouble.

1:07:41.560 --> 1:07:44.520
 Because I remember my cousin's mom was yelling at me.

1:07:44.520 --> 1:07:46.120
 And it was like, you monster.

1:07:46.120 --> 1:07:47.480
 All this crazy shit.

1:07:47.480 --> 1:07:50.920
 So my dad got me alone.

1:07:50.920 --> 1:07:52.920
 And he said, tell me what happened.

1:07:52.920 --> 1:07:56.600
 And I told him, you know, we got in a fight.

1:07:56.600 --> 1:07:57.800
 We were arguing.

1:07:57.800 --> 1:07:59.960
 We were King Kong, Godzilla.

1:07:59.960 --> 1:08:02.040
 And I punched him in the face.

1:08:02.040 --> 1:08:03.480
 And he goes, did you cry?

1:08:03.480 --> 1:08:04.280
 I go, no.

1:08:04.280 --> 1:08:05.080
 He goes, good.

1:08:05.080 --> 1:08:05.800
 Don't ever cry.

1:08:07.320 --> 1:08:09.400
 And I remember that.

1:08:09.400 --> 1:08:11.400
 Like, whoa, okay.

1:08:11.400 --> 1:08:12.440
 And I remember thinking, all right.

1:08:12.440 --> 1:08:18.520
 I'm just going to start punching people because like obviously my dad thinks it's a good idea

1:08:18.520 --> 1:08:21.480
 if I go running around punching people as long as I don't cry.

1:08:21.480 --> 1:08:30.280
 Like, I remember certain things about, you know, and also like this is, again, like we're

1:08:30.280 --> 1:08:37.080
 talking about watching Lenny Bruce and getting a timeline of what the world was like back

1:08:37.080 --> 1:08:37.560
 then.

1:08:37.560 --> 1:08:41.160
 This is a different world, you know, in 1970.

1:08:41.160 --> 1:08:43.160
 This would have been 1972.

1:08:43.160 --> 1:08:45.000
 It's a different world back then, man.

1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.240
 Like a really different world.

1:08:47.240 --> 1:08:52.040
 It's some of that, so Carl Jung talked about the shadow.

1:08:52.040 --> 1:08:58.280
 It's the unconscious where you have dark stuff and oftentimes you use it to project.

1:08:58.280 --> 1:09:01.640
 There's stuff that you're very self critical about yourself.

1:09:01.640 --> 1:09:06.280
 But because it's in your unconscious, you use it to project onto others.

1:09:06.280 --> 1:09:08.360
 You see it as flaws in others.

1:09:08.360 --> 1:09:14.120
 And that's a good way to, like whatever, he gives a quote, like everything that irritates

1:09:14.120 --> 1:09:17.480
 us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.

1:09:17.480 --> 1:09:21.800
 So that's a nice way to investigate yourself.

1:09:21.800 --> 1:09:26.360
 Like something that pisses you off, you start asking questions of your own mind, and that's

1:09:26.360 --> 1:09:27.720
 how you bring it to the surface.

1:09:27.720 --> 1:09:31.160
 But anyway, from that, those are formative years.

1:09:31.160 --> 1:09:36.120
 From that time, is there still stuff in your unconscious you think you haven't examined?

1:09:36.120 --> 1:09:37.400
 Some dark shit?

1:09:37.400 --> 1:09:38.520
 I don't think so.

1:09:38.520 --> 1:09:41.640
 I don't, I'm not aware if it is.

1:09:41.640 --> 1:09:49.720
 Cause I've looked, you know, like if someone, you know, someone says, you know, I left something

1:09:49.720 --> 1:09:50.720
 over your house.

1:09:50.720 --> 1:09:51.720
 Like, where'd you leave it?

1:09:51.720 --> 1:09:52.720
 I don't know.

1:09:52.720 --> 1:09:53.720
 Like, all right, I'll go look.

1:09:53.720 --> 1:09:54.720
 Yeah.

1:09:54.720 --> 1:09:55.720
 I'll get a real thorough look.

1:09:55.720 --> 1:09:56.720
 But I'm pretty sure.

1:09:56.720 --> 1:09:57.720
 Pretty sure it's not there.

1:09:57.720 --> 1:09:58.720
 Yeah.

1:09:58.720 --> 1:09:59.720
 Yeah.

1:09:59.720 --> 1:10:00.720
 I don't know.

1:10:00.720 --> 1:10:01.720
 I think I've looked.

1:10:01.720 --> 1:10:02.720
 I mean, it certainly had an effect.

1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:08.280
 I think the positive effect also was compounded by the fact that when my mother married my

1:10:08.280 --> 1:10:15.520
 stepdad, who's a great guy, who was a hippie, very different, we moved around a lot.

1:10:15.520 --> 1:10:19.980
 And so the bad thing about that was I didn't really develop longterm friends.

1:10:19.980 --> 1:10:24.920
 The good thing about that was that I was forced to develop my own opinions about things instead

1:10:24.920 --> 1:10:29.720
 of adopting an opinion of the neighborhood and the group about anything.

1:10:29.720 --> 1:10:35.960
 I was forced to form my own thoughts and opinions about almost everything.

1:10:35.960 --> 1:10:39.680
 And so it made me much more of an independent thinker.

1:10:39.680 --> 1:10:47.820
 So that on top of the fact that losing my quote unquote hero very early on and then

1:10:47.820 --> 1:10:55.520
 having to form my own opinions about things, it left me with a very independent streak

1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:56.520
 in terms of...

1:10:56.520 --> 1:11:03.520
 And if I hadn't done the things that I got interested in, martial arts and then comedy,

1:11:03.520 --> 1:11:07.520
 if I hadn't gotten interested in those things, I would have been fucked because I was just

1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:11.080
 too independent for normal jobs.

1:11:11.080 --> 1:11:12.840
 I was too independent for school.

1:11:12.840 --> 1:11:15.240
 I just didn't want to listen to people.

1:11:15.240 --> 1:11:16.640
 I was too feral.

1:11:16.640 --> 1:11:20.340
 I just didn't want to sit still.

1:11:20.340 --> 1:11:25.800
 If I was with the wrong parents, especially today, I most certainly would have been medicated.

1:11:25.800 --> 1:11:30.960
 Yeah, there's so many possible trajectories you can imagine where you would have not been

1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:32.200
 the person you are today.

1:11:32.200 --> 1:11:33.200
 Oh, yeah.

1:11:33.200 --> 1:11:38.160
 That's probably one of the best possible.

1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:41.660
 This particular storyline you're living through is one of the better ones.

1:11:41.660 --> 1:11:46.000
 This timeline is as good as it gets for someone like me.

1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:51.320
 Is there advice you can give to people, to young kids that are living through a shitty

1:11:51.320 --> 1:11:54.720
 situation of any sort, a tough life?

1:11:54.720 --> 1:11:56.620
 Find a thing you like.

1:11:56.620 --> 1:11:58.480
 Try to find a thing that you really enjoy.

1:11:58.480 --> 1:12:00.000
 Try to find a thing that you're passionate about.

1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:01.000
 Like an activity.

1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:02.000
 Yes.

1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:03.000
 For me, early on, it was drawing.

1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:04.000
 It was illustrations.

1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:05.280
 It was comic books.

1:12:05.280 --> 1:12:07.640
 I wanted to be a comic book illustrator.

1:12:07.640 --> 1:12:14.920
 Then it went from comic book drawing and illustrations to martial arts.

1:12:14.920 --> 1:12:21.660
 It was just another thing that I was very, very passionate about.

1:12:21.660 --> 1:12:25.440
 That was my vehicle out of my dilemma.

1:12:25.440 --> 1:12:34.840
 That was my vehicle out of my own anxiety and trauma and my own issues and insecurities.

1:12:34.840 --> 1:12:35.940
 Find something.

1:12:35.940 --> 1:12:42.420
 Find a thing that you genuinely enjoy because getting good at things you genuinely enjoy

1:12:42.420 --> 1:12:49.840
 is extremely beneficial for young people because it lets you know that everybody thinks they're

1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:50.840
 a loser.

1:12:50.840 --> 1:12:54.200
 Every young person thinks they're a loser, at least a young person in the situation I

1:12:54.200 --> 1:12:55.200
 was at.

1:12:55.200 --> 1:13:00.400
 I didn't know I wasn't a loser until I started winning, until I started doing martial arts.

1:13:00.400 --> 1:13:06.680
 Martial arts taught me that I could get better at stuff, that I wasn't really a loser.

1:13:06.680 --> 1:13:11.480
 I just was someone who was in a fucked up situation, but you could channel all that

1:13:11.480 --> 1:13:15.720
 energy that you have as a young person into something and get better at it.

1:13:15.720 --> 1:13:17.240
 Then all of a sudden, people admired me.

1:13:17.240 --> 1:13:18.760
 I was like, this is crazy.

1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:26.400
 I went from being someone who was incredibly insecure and basically a failure to someone

1:13:26.400 --> 1:13:30.620
 who was really successful at this one thing that was very dangerous that other people

1:13:30.620 --> 1:13:32.840
 were scared of.

1:13:32.840 --> 1:13:39.460
 That gave me immense confidence and also a real understanding of the direct correlation

1:13:39.460 --> 1:13:42.320
 between hard work and success.

1:13:42.320 --> 1:13:47.480
 And a kind of understanding that you're not a loser, that there is some diamond in the

1:13:47.480 --> 1:13:48.480
 rough.

1:13:48.480 --> 1:13:51.200
 There's also an understanding that you can't listen to people, because even my parents

1:13:51.200 --> 1:13:53.120
 didn't want me to do martial arts.

1:13:53.120 --> 1:13:54.120
 They didn't want me to fight.

1:13:54.120 --> 1:13:56.800
 They didn't want me to do stand up.

1:13:56.800 --> 1:14:05.440
 You have to understand who you are, and then in the face of other people's either criticism

1:14:05.440 --> 1:14:14.400
 or lack of faith in your ability to succeed, you push through and there's great benefit

1:14:14.400 --> 1:14:15.400
 in that.

1:14:15.400 --> 1:14:19.040
 And you realize that you can kind of apply that to other things in life.

1:14:19.040 --> 1:14:23.320
 You can apply that to critics, you can apply that to social media commentators, you can

1:14:23.320 --> 1:14:25.120
 apply that to a lot of things.

1:14:25.120 --> 1:14:26.120
 Okay.

1:14:26.120 --> 1:14:30.600
 What about young people in their 50s?

1:14:30.600 --> 1:14:36.200
 Can you give advice to like, imagine you're sitting back, probably still here in Texas

1:14:36.200 --> 1:14:41.640
 in your 90s looking back, what advice would that guy give to you today?

1:14:41.640 --> 1:14:51.000
 Or like people that have done some shit in their 50s, you've gone through hell of a life,

1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:58.640
 there's potentially some incentive to settle down, you got a great family to relax.

1:14:58.640 --> 1:15:03.000
 But maybe there's some incentive to still do epic shit, still be David Goggins running

1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:05.760
 in the middle of the desert screaming shit into a camera.

1:15:05.760 --> 1:15:09.160
 If you're David Goggins, you have to be David Goggins.

1:15:09.160 --> 1:15:14.320
 I don't think there's a path for that guy that exists at this stage of his life other

1:15:14.320 --> 1:15:15.320
 than that.

1:15:15.320 --> 1:15:17.640
 Do you think he'll be 70 and still screaming?

1:15:17.640 --> 1:15:18.640
 Yes.

1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:19.640
 Okay.

1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:20.640
 100%.

1:15:20.640 --> 1:15:21.640
 100%.

1:15:21.640 --> 1:15:30.080
 If David and I are alive, we're both 70, he's going to call me up and say, stay hard motherfucker.

1:15:30.080 --> 1:15:31.080
 Guaranteed.

1:15:31.080 --> 1:15:32.080
 Guaranteed.

1:15:32.080 --> 1:15:35.040
 So lean into whatever the fuck you are at this point.

1:15:35.040 --> 1:15:39.280
 Well, if you're enjoying it, but if you're not enjoying it, rethink your life.

1:15:39.280 --> 1:15:41.680
 Try to figure out why you're not enjoying it.

1:15:41.680 --> 1:15:44.880
 You still think it's possible to shift things in your 50s?

1:15:44.880 --> 1:15:45.880
 Yeah.

1:15:45.880 --> 1:15:47.280
 If you're alive, you can get better.

1:15:47.280 --> 1:15:48.280
 No matter what.

1:15:48.280 --> 1:15:49.280
 Yeah.

1:15:49.280 --> 1:15:50.280
 No matter what.

1:15:50.280 --> 1:15:51.280
 If you're alive, you can shift things.

1:15:51.280 --> 1:15:55.840
 I mean, if you're 90 years old and you have a month to live, you can apologize for the

1:15:55.840 --> 1:16:02.320
 things you think you did wrong and maybe reconcile and shape relationships that you have with

1:16:02.320 --> 1:16:06.040
 the people that are around you better, so that they feel differently about you after

1:16:06.040 --> 1:16:07.040
 you're gone.

1:16:07.040 --> 1:16:08.040
 Yeah.

1:16:08.040 --> 1:16:12.080
 I always love people in their 70s who are like getting back into dating or something

1:16:12.080 --> 1:16:13.080
 like that.

1:16:13.080 --> 1:16:14.080
 Yeah.

1:16:14.080 --> 1:16:17.120
 I was watching a video about a woman who's in her 60s who just started powerlifting.

1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:18.120
 Nice.

1:16:18.120 --> 1:16:19.120
 Yeah.

1:16:19.120 --> 1:16:20.120
 And same with Jiu Jitsu.

1:16:20.120 --> 1:16:25.240
 You see people get into Jiu Jitsu, like a white belt that's like 70.

1:16:25.240 --> 1:16:26.240
 Yeah.

1:16:26.240 --> 1:16:27.240
 Yeah.

1:16:27.240 --> 1:16:28.240
 Yeah.

1:16:28.240 --> 1:16:29.240
 There's a lot of...

1:16:29.240 --> 1:16:33.760
 If you're alive, you can get better at stuff.

1:16:33.760 --> 1:16:40.960
 I don't think people are happy if they don't have puzzles and complex tasks and things

1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:45.440
 that are interesting to them, whether it's an art project or whether it's learning something

1:16:45.440 --> 1:16:48.440
 completely new like standup comedy.

1:16:48.440 --> 1:16:57.520
 Doing things that are difficult, it's as much of a nourishment of the mind as food is a

1:16:57.520 --> 1:16:59.000
 nourishment of the body.

1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:07.680
 I think you need things that are puzzling to you where you have to find your own human

1:17:07.680 --> 1:17:13.320
 potential in the difficulty of the task and work your way through things.

1:17:13.320 --> 1:17:18.800
 At least for me, I mean, I can only speak for me because I'm the only life that I've

1:17:18.800 --> 1:17:20.640
 ever lived that I'm aware of.

1:17:20.640 --> 1:17:26.800
 And in my life, that has been a 100% constant.

1:17:26.800 --> 1:17:31.000
 I am a very happy person and I have never had a moment where I'm not doing difficult

1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:32.000
 shit.

1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:33.000
 Yeah.

1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:34.000
 Ever.

1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:37.200
 What matters most is how well you walk through the fires.

1:17:37.200 --> 1:17:39.600
 You just keep starting fires for yourself to walk through.

1:17:39.600 --> 1:17:43.060
 Well, they don't necessarily have to be fires, right?

1:17:43.060 --> 1:17:45.880
 Because fires are like kind of out of control.

1:17:45.880 --> 1:17:46.880
 Lukewarm tasks.

1:17:46.880 --> 1:17:47.880
 Tasks.

1:17:47.880 --> 1:17:48.880
 The surfaces.

1:17:48.880 --> 1:17:49.880
 Tasks.

1:17:49.880 --> 1:17:56.120
 Give yourself something, an arduous, difficult task where you're challenged, challenged mentally

1:17:56.120 --> 1:17:57.120
 and challenged physically.

1:17:57.120 --> 1:18:01.420
 One of the great things about being challenged physically is it's also mental.

1:18:01.420 --> 1:18:05.220
 The people that don't understand that have never really been challenged physically.

1:18:05.220 --> 1:18:09.160
 People that think that physical challenges are just like, just physical.

1:18:09.160 --> 1:18:12.140
 It's just brute grunt work.

1:18:12.140 --> 1:18:13.200
 It's not.

1:18:13.200 --> 1:18:15.640
 It's emotional intelligence.

1:18:15.640 --> 1:18:21.800
 It's understanding your desire to quit and, you know, conquering your inner bitch.

1:18:21.800 --> 1:18:24.480
 All that stuff is, it's mental.

1:18:24.480 --> 1:18:29.940
 It's playing out inside your head and there's a mental strength that you acquire from that,

1:18:29.940 --> 1:18:33.040
 that you can apply to intellectual pursuits.

1:18:33.040 --> 1:18:39.280
 And the people that don't think that are the people that haven't attempted them.

1:18:39.280 --> 1:18:46.440
 And there's an arrogance to people that only pursue intellectual exercises, only pursue

1:18:46.440 --> 1:18:49.640
 intellectual things and don't pursue anything physical.

1:18:49.640 --> 1:18:54.200
 That the physical stuff is base, it's grunt work, it's primal, it's not necessary.

1:18:54.200 --> 1:18:56.360
 I don't think that's accurate.

1:18:56.360 --> 1:18:59.920
 I don't think that they're, I mean, obviously these people like Stephen Hawking's who have

1:18:59.920 --> 1:19:04.080
 no opportunity to do anything physical, right?

1:19:04.080 --> 1:19:08.340
 His physical dilemma is keeping us or was keeping his heart beating.

1:19:08.340 --> 1:19:14.400
 But for most people, I think you can really benefit from physical struggle and you benefit

1:19:14.400 --> 1:19:16.880
 from it in a mental way.

1:19:16.880 --> 1:19:19.160
 And I think that is overlooked.

1:19:19.160 --> 1:19:25.440
 It's unfortunately overlooked by academics and intellectuals who they make excuses for

1:19:25.440 --> 1:19:28.440
 why they're fat and lazy or scrawny.

1:19:28.440 --> 1:19:33.280
 They don't need to be, it's not even about the fat or all of that.

1:19:33.280 --> 1:19:37.100
 It's like literally there's something about the physical challenge that's really good

1:19:37.100 --> 1:19:41.340
 for you, especially if you're academic, especially if you do intellectual type stuff.

1:19:41.340 --> 1:19:47.000
 There's this great roboticist at MIT, Russ Tedrick, he runs barefoot to and from MIT

1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:48.000
 every day.

1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:51.800
 I love it, like seven, seven to 10 miles each way.

1:19:51.800 --> 1:19:52.800
 Barefoot.

1:19:52.800 --> 1:19:53.800
 Barefoot.

1:19:53.800 --> 1:19:59.400
 Well, he studies legged locomotion, legged robots, so for him, it's also interesting

1:19:59.400 --> 1:20:00.540
 how the human body moves.

1:20:00.540 --> 1:20:02.920
 He sees the beauty in all movement.

1:20:02.920 --> 1:20:04.800
 What do his feet look like?

1:20:04.800 --> 1:20:05.800
 You know, calloused.

1:20:05.800 --> 1:20:06.800
 Destroyed, right?

1:20:06.800 --> 1:20:07.800
 No, just calloused.

1:20:07.800 --> 1:20:08.800
 They're nice.

1:20:08.800 --> 1:20:16.040
 They form a nice, it's not like I gave him a foot massage, but I mean, they look, and

1:20:16.040 --> 1:20:21.800
 I don't have a foot fetish, so I don't, I'm not able to correctly evaluate another man's

1:20:21.800 --> 1:20:22.800
 feet.

1:20:22.800 --> 1:20:25.840
 I apologize for this, but they don't look fucked up.

1:20:25.840 --> 1:20:27.560
 Does he run on concrete?

1:20:27.560 --> 1:20:30.200
 Yeah, he runs all surfaces.

1:20:30.200 --> 1:20:33.060
 And he does everything completely barefoot?

1:20:33.060 --> 1:20:35.040
 The running part at work.

1:20:35.040 --> 1:20:39.120
 So one of the things he has to do is fit into society, which means he has to change clothes

1:20:39.120 --> 1:20:40.120
 and appear normal.

1:20:40.120 --> 1:20:41.120
 Right.

1:20:41.120 --> 1:20:43.880
 So does he wear like zero shoes?

1:20:43.880 --> 1:20:46.200
 Yeah, those barefoot type shoes?

1:20:46.200 --> 1:20:50.160
 No, because that's like very hippie, wokey type of thing.

1:20:50.160 --> 1:20:55.680
 No, like he doesn't, he's barefoot when he's running and then he wears like normal looking

1:20:55.680 --> 1:20:56.680
 stuff like dress shoes.

1:20:56.680 --> 1:20:59.480
 How did he work his way up to running barefoot?

1:20:59.480 --> 1:21:07.840
 So he was significantly overweight and his advisor, this other famous person at MIT who

1:21:07.840 --> 1:21:15.720
 was a roboticist, took his own life and that made him, that made Russ face his own mortality,

1:21:15.720 --> 1:21:16.720
 I think.

1:21:16.720 --> 1:21:21.280
 I mean, you start to ask big questions about your wellbeing, like, holy shit, this ride

1:21:21.280 --> 1:21:22.280
 can end at any moment.

1:21:22.280 --> 1:21:28.560
 And so he started taking his sort of physical wellbeing seriously, but as a result of that,

1:21:28.560 --> 1:21:35.440
 not that he, did he become like shredded, but he's also discovered the intellectual

1:21:35.440 --> 1:21:41.880
 value, the humbling value of physical exercise.

1:21:41.880 --> 1:21:43.320
 He's not preachy about it at all.

1:21:43.320 --> 1:21:46.560
 I actually rarely hear him advise it to anyone.

1:21:46.560 --> 1:21:51.920
 He just does it as a, almost like meditation or something like that.

1:21:51.920 --> 1:21:54.680
 It's definitely a form of meditation and you can attest to that, right?

1:21:54.680 --> 1:21:56.480
 You do quite a bit of running.

1:21:56.480 --> 1:22:04.440
 There's a thing about a, you kind of, almost like a mantra gets formed and you get into

1:22:04.440 --> 1:22:05.440
 it.

1:22:05.440 --> 1:22:08.200
 It was great here in the Austin heat, a hundred degree weather.

1:22:08.200 --> 1:22:09.200
 That tests you.

1:22:09.200 --> 1:22:10.920
 You know what I love to do outside?

1:22:10.920 --> 1:22:11.920
 Pull sleds.

1:22:11.920 --> 1:22:12.920
 That's my thing.

1:22:12.920 --> 1:22:15.760
 I love to pull sleds outside.

1:22:15.760 --> 1:22:16.760
 In the heat.

1:22:16.760 --> 1:22:17.760
 Yeah.

1:22:17.760 --> 1:22:18.760
 I did it today.

1:22:18.760 --> 1:22:19.760
 Yeah.

1:22:19.760 --> 1:22:20.760
 Yeah, I love it.

1:22:20.760 --> 1:22:22.360
 So you're also, your wife is incredible.

1:22:22.360 --> 1:22:23.360
 You're in a relationship.

1:22:23.360 --> 1:22:24.360
 You're married.

1:22:24.360 --> 1:22:26.200
 You have a great family.

1:22:26.200 --> 1:22:32.300
 What advice would you give to me and to others like me who are dumb fucks and have not found

1:22:32.300 --> 1:22:33.300
 a relationship?

1:22:33.300 --> 1:22:34.300
 Well, you're a great guy.

1:22:34.300 --> 1:22:39.920
 So this definitely doesn't necessarily apply to you, but be someone who someone would want

1:22:39.920 --> 1:22:41.900
 to be in a relationship with.

1:22:41.900 --> 1:22:44.380
 There's a lot of people out there that want a great partner.

1:22:44.380 --> 1:22:48.600
 They want someone in a relationship, but why would someone want to be in a relationship

1:22:48.600 --> 1:22:49.600
 with you?

1:22:49.600 --> 1:22:51.740
 You know, maybe you bicker a lot.

1:22:51.740 --> 1:22:52.980
 Maybe you're jealous.

1:22:52.980 --> 1:22:55.740
 Maybe you, uh, maybe you lie.

1:22:55.740 --> 1:23:02.940
 Maybe you, you know, maybe you're cruel, maybe you're, you don't have a sense of humor.

1:23:02.940 --> 1:23:05.200
 Maybe you're, you know, you're not kind.

1:23:05.200 --> 1:23:11.680
 Like what is, what is it about you that people would not enjoy being around or the people

1:23:11.680 --> 1:23:12.680
 avoid?

1:23:12.680 --> 1:23:13.680
 Fix that.

1:23:13.680 --> 1:23:14.680
 Fix that.

1:23:14.680 --> 1:23:15.920
 Well, this applies to me as well.

1:23:15.920 --> 1:23:18.360
 Like you, you said something with Cam Haynes.

1:23:18.360 --> 1:23:23.080
 One of the things you admire is the, the discipline it takes to sort of juggle so many things

1:23:23.080 --> 1:23:24.080
 and just successfully.

1:23:24.080 --> 1:23:26.600
 I'm not sure I'm very good at that.

1:23:26.600 --> 1:23:29.960
 So juggling all this hard work and then also a relationship.

1:23:29.960 --> 1:23:32.480
 Also relationship, also family, all of these kinds of priorities.

1:23:32.480 --> 1:23:35.360
 I mean, that requires having your shit together.

1:23:35.360 --> 1:23:36.360
 It does.

1:23:36.360 --> 1:23:39.080
 It's a different thing, but it's also, you got to find the right person.

1:23:39.080 --> 1:23:42.400
 There's a lot of people who sell for, they settle for sexy.

1:23:42.400 --> 1:23:46.160
 They settle for hot, settle for the wrong person.

1:23:46.160 --> 1:23:48.640
 Like you can get hot and nice.

1:23:48.640 --> 1:23:49.640
 They're out there.

1:23:49.640 --> 1:23:50.640
 Yeah.

1:23:50.640 --> 1:23:53.400
 But don't get hot and mean, hot and mean is not fun.

1:23:53.400 --> 1:23:54.400
 Then you get Amber Heard.

1:23:54.400 --> 1:23:55.400
 Yeah.

1:23:55.400 --> 1:23:56.400
 You know?

1:23:56.400 --> 1:23:57.400
 And then you get hot and dry.

1:23:57.400 --> 1:23:58.400
 Yeah.

1:23:58.400 --> 1:23:59.400
 Yeah.

1:23:59.400 --> 1:24:00.400
 Yeah.

1:24:00.400 --> 1:24:01.400
 You can be deceived by perfect symmetry.

1:24:01.400 --> 1:24:04.680
 So you don't think it's a good idea to record your partner?

1:24:04.680 --> 1:24:07.160
 I think you should record all conversations.

1:24:07.160 --> 1:24:09.200
 The CIA is doing it no matter what.

1:24:09.200 --> 1:24:14.280
 I assume that every conversation I have is recorded because I'm pretty sure it is.

1:24:14.280 --> 1:24:16.480
 Even when we had dinner with Alex Jones, he was recording.

1:24:16.480 --> 1:24:17.480
 Yeah.

1:24:17.480 --> 1:24:18.480
 I still remember that.

1:24:18.480 --> 1:24:21.400
 I didn't know that was recording.

1:24:21.400 --> 1:24:22.400
 He might, you know what?

1:24:22.400 --> 1:24:24.880
 It'd be funny if he is the CIA.

1:24:24.880 --> 1:24:25.880
 He could be.

1:24:25.880 --> 1:24:26.880
 Could be.

1:24:26.880 --> 1:24:27.880
 That'd be the ultimate joke.

1:24:27.880 --> 1:24:32.000
 So my advice about relationships is be somebody.

1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:38.680
 And then also like find someone who you can grow with, right?

1:24:38.680 --> 1:24:43.640
 You don't want to be with someone who doesn't share your values.

1:24:43.640 --> 1:24:46.120
 You don't want to be with someone who makes excuses.

1:24:46.120 --> 1:24:49.960
 You don't want to be with someone who's lazy or who's spiteful.

1:24:49.960 --> 1:24:53.540
 You want to be with someone who's like genuinely kind.

1:24:53.540 --> 1:24:56.720
 That's one of the things that I really love about my wife and she's very smart and she

1:24:56.720 --> 1:24:58.720
 works hard.

1:24:58.720 --> 1:25:02.740
 She's a dedicated, disciplined person, but she's also really nice.

1:25:02.740 --> 1:25:05.040
 That's one of the things I like the most about her.

1:25:05.040 --> 1:25:06.160
 She's so nice.

1:25:06.160 --> 1:25:09.240
 She's always smiling.

1:25:09.240 --> 1:25:10.720
 And that energy is great.

1:25:10.720 --> 1:25:11.720
 Yeah.

1:25:11.720 --> 1:25:12.720
 I mean, you've seen us together.

1:25:12.720 --> 1:25:13.720
 Yeah.

1:25:13.720 --> 1:25:14.720
 You've hung around with us.

1:25:14.720 --> 1:25:15.720
 She's fun.

1:25:15.720 --> 1:25:16.720
 Yeah.

1:25:16.720 --> 1:25:17.720
 She's a lot of fun.

1:25:17.720 --> 1:25:18.720
 Yeah.

1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:19.720
 She makes you just feel great to be alive.

1:25:19.720 --> 1:25:20.720
 It's good to have people like that around you.

1:25:20.720 --> 1:25:21.720
 She's happy.

1:25:21.720 --> 1:25:22.720
 She's a happy person.

1:25:22.720 --> 1:25:23.900
 She's happy to be around.

1:25:23.900 --> 1:25:28.820
 That's the kind of people that you could have in your life as friends and as coworkers and

1:25:28.820 --> 1:25:30.780
 as lovers and wives and husbands.

1:25:30.780 --> 1:25:32.280
 You can find those people.

1:25:32.280 --> 1:25:33.280
 They're real.

1:25:33.280 --> 1:25:36.100
 And when you find those people, your life is better.

1:25:36.100 --> 1:25:41.320
 To have a good tribe is very important, to have a good tribe of people.

1:25:41.320 --> 1:25:45.700
 And I think if there's anything that I'm very, very fortunate about, it's the people that

1:25:45.700 --> 1:25:46.960
 I'm around.

1:25:46.960 --> 1:25:51.040
 I have very good friends and one of which is you.

1:25:51.040 --> 1:25:58.360
 It's so valuable to have quality people around you because it makes you want to do better

1:25:58.360 --> 1:26:03.340
 because you admire the hard work that these people put in, like Cam Haines or Goggins

1:26:03.340 --> 1:26:10.040
 or many of my friends and people that are generous and people that are curious and people

1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:11.880
 that are honest.

1:26:11.880 --> 1:26:16.200
 They inspire you to do the same and it's extremely valuable.

1:26:16.200 --> 1:26:23.240
 It's one of the most valuable things is to surround yourself with positive, healthy,

1:26:23.240 --> 1:26:25.880
 friendly, generous people.

1:26:25.880 --> 1:26:27.840
 That's why I cut out Tim Dillon from my life.

1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:28.840
 I broke up with him.

1:26:28.840 --> 1:26:29.840
 I thought you guys were getting married.

1:26:29.840 --> 1:26:31.320
 No, it's over.

1:26:31.320 --> 1:26:32.320
 It's none of those things.

1:26:32.320 --> 1:26:40.460
 The Texas nonstop, the nonstop conspiracy theories, the nonstop mocking of my Eastern

1:26:40.460 --> 1:26:46.700
 European origins, it's just not healthy for me.

1:26:46.700 --> 1:26:51.320
 Plus he's physically abusive and a towering figure, both emotional and physically.

1:26:51.320 --> 1:26:53.440
 No, no, I love him.

1:26:53.440 --> 1:26:54.440
 Okay.

1:26:54.440 --> 1:26:55.440
 If he worked out, he would be a house.

1:26:55.440 --> 1:26:56.440
 A brick house.

1:26:56.440 --> 1:26:59.420
 He's got such a large frame, you know?

1:26:59.420 --> 1:27:03.480
 So if I interview Putin, what should I ask him?

1:27:03.480 --> 1:27:04.480
 How's the cancer?

1:27:04.480 --> 1:27:07.880
 How's it doing, buddy?

1:27:07.880 --> 1:27:09.880
 That's question number one in Russian.

1:27:09.880 --> 1:27:12.200
 Do you think he has cancer?

1:27:12.200 --> 1:27:13.680
 I don't think so.

1:27:13.680 --> 1:27:16.120
 The narrative is terrifying, right?

1:27:16.120 --> 1:27:21.020
 Dictator of the largest nuclear arsenal in the world who also has cancer and he just

1:27:21.020 --> 1:27:22.920
 invaded a sovereign country.

1:27:22.920 --> 1:27:25.240
 That's a terrifying narrative because that's what we're all afraid of.

1:27:25.240 --> 1:27:29.840
 Someone who has nothing to lose who just decides to let loose a nuke.

1:27:29.840 --> 1:27:35.880
 Well, I do think maybe it's projecting, but if I had cancer or if you think about leaders

1:27:35.880 --> 1:27:41.160
 that have cancer, you're facing your own mortality, I would think he would be more focused on

1:27:41.160 --> 1:27:46.660
 his legacy and dropping a nuclear bomb is not good for legacy.

1:27:46.660 --> 1:27:51.080
 I do believe he wants to be remembered as a great leader, as a lot of leaders do, as

1:27:51.080 --> 1:27:52.520
 a lot of even dictators do.

1:27:52.520 --> 1:28:02.160
 And I think he wants to figure out a way to pull out a win so he can say that whatever

1:28:02.160 --> 1:28:08.520
 this thing was, whatever this invasion was, was good for Russia, was good for the nation.

1:28:08.520 --> 1:28:11.680
 He ultimately made it a greater nation than it was before.

1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:18.440
 And perhaps you could justify an escalation of war to be that.

1:28:18.440 --> 1:28:24.000
 And it's just the cancer thing concerns me so much because it's been so often part of

1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:27.200
 this propaganda that's been told about Putin that he's sick.

1:28:27.200 --> 1:28:30.200
 I don't know why.

1:28:30.200 --> 1:28:34.960
 People kind of wonder that a lot about, especially dictators, but you had that even with Hillary

1:28:34.960 --> 1:28:40.020
 Clinton and obviously with Biden, that narrative is stickier.

1:28:40.020 --> 1:28:41.020
 So for some people it's stickier than that.

1:28:41.020 --> 1:28:44.240
 Well, that narrative is transparent and obvious.

1:28:44.240 --> 1:28:49.520
 But the degree of it is a question with Biden as it is with everyone.

1:28:49.520 --> 1:28:50.920
 How healthy is this leader?

1:28:50.920 --> 1:28:52.480
 That's a question people often ask.

1:28:52.480 --> 1:28:53.480
 Sure, always.

1:28:53.480 --> 1:28:55.640
 They were doing that about Trump too.

1:28:55.640 --> 1:29:02.800
 The thing about Putin though is like his appearance is altered, where he looks very bloated.

1:29:02.800 --> 1:29:07.320
 His body doesn't look much bigger, but his face looks like puffy and swollen.

1:29:07.320 --> 1:29:15.640
 I had a friend who had sarcoidosis and they prescribed prednisone, which is a type of

1:29:15.640 --> 1:29:16.640
 a steroid.

1:29:16.640 --> 1:29:20.960
 And one of the things that would happen when he was on it is his face would get really

1:29:20.960 --> 1:29:21.960
 big.

1:29:21.960 --> 1:29:30.200
 He was like, he would blow up like a swell up and maintain a lot of water and inflammation.

1:29:30.200 --> 1:29:32.960
 And that's what it looks like when I'm looking at Putin.

1:29:32.960 --> 1:29:37.080
 So actually like if you're sitting with him, one question is about health.

1:29:37.080 --> 1:29:41.440
 Has Biden been asked that kind of question?

1:29:41.440 --> 1:29:42.920
 Like without mockery, without any of that?

1:29:42.920 --> 1:29:44.360
 You would have to go on Fox News.

1:29:44.360 --> 1:29:49.960
 Like the mainstream media treats him with kid gloves in a way that I've never seen.

1:29:49.960 --> 1:29:55.320
 It's so obvious there's something horribly wrong with his cognitive function.

1:29:55.320 --> 1:29:57.560
 Well, I had to push back.

1:29:57.560 --> 1:29:59.400
 I don't know if it's horribly wrong.

1:29:59.400 --> 1:30:00.400
 You don't think it's horribly wrong?

1:30:00.400 --> 1:30:04.880
 I think it's no, I think there's uncertainty to which degree is wrong.

1:30:04.880 --> 1:30:09.760
 I would love to there to be a serious like conversation about with him.

1:30:09.760 --> 1:30:17.440
 In fact, I actually have to now look, cause of course Fox News will mock his like declining

1:30:17.440 --> 1:30:22.760
 mental health and then I would love like sort of an objective discussion.

1:30:22.760 --> 1:30:24.120
 Are you aware of this?

1:30:24.120 --> 1:30:27.200
 Are you like, what are you putting in place?

1:30:27.200 --> 1:30:28.200
 Are you yourself?

1:30:28.200 --> 1:30:36.480
 Cause if I was a person with a declining mental abilities, like you have to start thinking

1:30:36.480 --> 1:30:37.480
 about that kind of stuff.

1:30:37.480 --> 1:30:40.520
 Like who is around you, who are the advisors?

1:30:40.520 --> 1:30:44.160
 What if you start, stop being able to see the world clearly?

1:30:44.160 --> 1:30:46.200
 I would be transparent about that kind of stuff.

1:30:46.200 --> 1:30:50.720
 Well, you would be, but you're also would never be a politician because you're too fucking

1:30:50.720 --> 1:30:51.720
 honest.

1:30:51.720 --> 1:30:56.160
 Well, yeah, but actually from a conversation perspective, it would be nice if that kind

1:30:56.160 --> 1:30:57.160
 of discussion was sad.

1:30:57.160 --> 1:30:58.160
 It would be.

1:30:58.160 --> 1:31:08.960
 But all jokes aside with Putin, I would ask questions about democracy versus what they

1:31:08.960 --> 1:31:09.960
 have.

1:31:09.960 --> 1:31:17.360
 So that without any disparaging descriptions of what is going on over in Russia, it's clearly

1:31:17.360 --> 1:31:20.080
 not a democracy.

1:31:20.080 --> 1:31:26.800
 It's they, I mean the way he has it set up, the elections are a joke.

1:31:26.800 --> 1:31:27.800
 He's

1:31:27.800 --> 1:31:28.800
 So he would push back.

1:31:28.800 --> 1:31:30.040
 That's not clearly not a democracy.

1:31:30.040 --> 1:31:31.120
 He is still very popular.

1:31:31.120 --> 1:31:35.080
 So majority of people are huge supporters of Putin inside Russia.

1:31:35.080 --> 1:31:41.040
 The he would, the people that push back against that would say that that's because any serious

1:31:41.040 --> 1:31:43.120
 opposition is pushed out of the country.

1:31:43.120 --> 1:31:44.120
 Yeah.

1:31:44.120 --> 1:31:45.760
 So it gets competition and murdered.

1:31:45.760 --> 1:31:46.760
 Yeah.

1:31:46.760 --> 1:31:49.080
 So, but yes, that's a really, really good question.

1:31:49.080 --> 1:31:51.000
 The value of dictatorships.

1:31:51.000 --> 1:31:56.640
 One of the things about the United States that's fascinating to me is that every four

1:31:56.640 --> 1:32:00.920
 years, unless it's a, it's four to eight years, right?

1:32:00.920 --> 1:32:06.960
 One does two terms, but every four years there's an opportunity for someone to be new and completely

1:32:06.960 --> 1:32:12.320
 inexperienced at the most difficult job in the world, which is ridiculous.

1:32:12.320 --> 1:32:18.600
 So the interesting thing is it actually makes sense after eight years, you've gained the

1:32:18.600 --> 1:32:19.600
 wisdom.

1:32:19.600 --> 1:32:20.600
 Yeah.

1:32:20.600 --> 1:32:21.760
 You would actually be a pretty good leader to keep going.

1:32:21.760 --> 1:32:22.760
 Yeah.

1:32:22.760 --> 1:32:26.160
 But there is some problem where you, the power gets started getting to your head.

1:32:26.160 --> 1:32:27.160
 Yeah.

1:32:27.160 --> 1:32:32.040
 So from Putin's perspective, I think he genuinely wants the best for Russia.

1:32:32.040 --> 1:32:37.520
 I don't think he's lost his mind in terms of like, it's all about greed and so on.

1:32:37.520 --> 1:32:38.520
 Same as Stalin.

1:32:38.520 --> 1:32:43.400
 I think Stalin until the end of his days wanted the best for the Soviet Union.

1:32:43.400 --> 1:32:47.280
 So it's not like you become, Hitler I think lost his mind during the war.

1:32:47.280 --> 1:32:50.200
 Like where it was like he wasn't seen clearly at all.

1:32:50.200 --> 1:32:56.320
 What Putin believes is that he is actually the best person to bring out the best for

1:32:56.320 --> 1:32:57.320
 his country.

1:32:57.320 --> 1:33:04.320
 Now, the problem is maybe refreshing the leader is in fact in the long term, the best thing

1:33:04.320 --> 1:33:08.240
 versus every leader believes they know what's best for the country, the point is to keep

1:33:08.240 --> 1:33:09.240
 refreshing it.

1:33:09.240 --> 1:33:10.240
 Well.

1:33:10.240 --> 1:33:12.080
 And that's the case for democracy.

1:33:12.080 --> 1:33:18.800
 That's the case for the system we have that creates a natural, maybe emergent balance

1:33:18.800 --> 1:33:20.000
 of power.

1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:24.480
 I think it makes it evident that there is no clear cut real right way to do it.

1:33:24.480 --> 1:33:30.760
 And that if you had the perfect person in having them for 12, 20 years would be amazing.

1:33:30.760 --> 1:33:36.560
 If you had a perfect benevolent leader who clearly only cared about the people was doing

1:33:36.560 --> 1:33:43.040
 their best and striving hard and got great satisfaction knowing that he is a dedicated

1:33:43.040 --> 1:33:48.560
 civil servant that only wants to lead the country in a way that's going to benefit the

1:33:48.560 --> 1:33:52.640
 most people in the most profound way.

1:33:52.640 --> 1:33:56.480
 But we have a dirty political system.

1:33:56.480 --> 1:34:01.080
 It's completely corrupted by money, completely corrupted by influence.

1:34:01.080 --> 1:34:08.080
 The fact that the lobbyists, I mean, there's an area outside of Washington DC, it's one

1:34:08.080 --> 1:34:11.520
 of the richest areas in the country and it's where the lobbyists live.

1:34:11.520 --> 1:34:16.700
 There's so much money involved in being a lobbyist, there's so much money involved in

1:34:16.700 --> 1:34:23.940
 special interest groups and how much of an impact they have on who gets elected and what

1:34:23.940 --> 1:34:26.160
 decisions get made once that person gets elected.

1:34:26.160 --> 1:34:27.400
 We know this, right?

1:34:27.400 --> 1:34:30.720
 We know it's not for the people by the people, it's just not what it is.

1:34:30.720 --> 1:34:36.080
 I mean, this country is an experiment in self government and if we could do it all over

1:34:36.080 --> 1:34:41.320
 again, I would say the most important thing is to have laws in place to keep money out

1:34:41.320 --> 1:34:53.200
 of politics and to make it a heinous crime for someone to influence laws and policy based

1:34:53.200 --> 1:35:02.040
 entirely on the amount of profit it could generate for a party or for a company that

1:35:02.040 --> 1:35:04.740
 is investing in a candidate.

1:35:04.740 --> 1:35:09.500
 That's fucking incredibly dangerous and it's corrupt and that corruption has been accepted.

1:35:09.500 --> 1:35:14.320
 We've just accepted that this corruption exists, you know?

1:35:14.320 --> 1:35:15.320
 Last question.

1:35:15.320 --> 1:35:19.560
 If Putin asks to see this watch, what do I tell him?

1:35:19.560 --> 1:35:20.560
 Would you give it?

1:35:20.560 --> 1:35:21.880
 Should I let him see it?

1:35:21.880 --> 1:35:23.960
 Because we know what happens with the Super Bowl ring.

1:35:23.960 --> 1:35:26.840
 I think a Super Bowl ring is unique.

1:35:26.840 --> 1:35:30.400
 He could buy a watch like that pretty easy, you know?

1:35:30.400 --> 1:35:32.480
 But this particular, isn't that a power move?

1:35:32.480 --> 1:35:33.480
 Yeah.

1:35:33.480 --> 1:35:36.800
 So this is the watch you gave me as a story.

1:35:36.800 --> 1:35:37.800
 Yes.

1:35:37.800 --> 1:35:41.060
 I would probably share it with him, the story.

1:35:41.060 --> 1:35:43.120
 And then maybe you go, can I see this watch?

1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:44.120
 Yeah.

1:35:44.120 --> 1:35:45.120
 And then he puts it on and says thank you.

1:35:45.120 --> 1:35:46.120
 Do you say no?

1:35:46.120 --> 1:35:47.280
 Do you say no?

1:35:47.280 --> 1:35:48.280
 You go like this.

1:35:48.280 --> 1:35:49.280
 Yeah, there it is, bro.

1:35:49.280 --> 1:35:50.280
 Bro.

1:35:50.280 --> 1:35:51.280
 You know, take it off.

1:35:51.280 --> 1:35:55.760
 I've got so many words I'm going to have to find translations, buddy, bro.

1:35:55.760 --> 1:35:56.760
 I guess bro is brother.

1:35:56.760 --> 1:36:00.720
 I mean, if he takes your watch, I'll buy you another one if Putin steals it.

1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:01.720
 Keep him going.

1:36:01.720 --> 1:36:04.800
 I'll just give you the same exact watch.

1:36:04.800 --> 1:36:06.680
 Well, first of all, thank you for this.

1:36:06.680 --> 1:36:07.680
 My pleasure, bro.

1:36:07.680 --> 1:36:13.760
 I really wanted to talk to you because in a couple of days I'm leaving to Ukraine and

1:36:13.760 --> 1:36:21.120
 Russia and I hope I'll be back in one piece and drink whiskey with you once again.

1:36:21.120 --> 1:36:22.480
 Yeah, I hope so too.

1:36:22.480 --> 1:36:24.560
 I'm nervous about you going over there.

1:36:24.560 --> 1:36:28.520
 You know, I know journalists have been killed now.

1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:31.520
 But they don't know Jiu Jitsu.

1:36:31.520 --> 1:36:35.960
 No, I think you'll be okay and I think there's certain things you do in life that just kind

1:36:35.960 --> 1:36:38.640
 of your heart pulls towards that so much.

1:36:38.640 --> 1:36:40.680
 What's your objective over there?

1:36:40.680 --> 1:36:43.920
 I'm not somebody who thinks about objectives clearly.

1:36:43.920 --> 1:36:47.620
 It's just something about me says I need to go there.

1:36:47.620 --> 1:36:56.560
 But to put in loose words is to try to understand what that world is now.

1:36:56.560 --> 1:37:00.600
 So I remember what it was years ago when I was there.

1:37:00.600 --> 1:37:06.000
 I know my family, I know the generations of family that was there on that land in Ukraine

1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:13.840
 and in Russia, and the soul of the people, the love that's there, the beauty of the culture.

1:37:13.840 --> 1:37:18.200
 And I want to see what it is today and what this war has created.

1:37:18.200 --> 1:37:22.640
 Both the anger and the love and the people and just hear them out and just talk to them.

1:37:22.640 --> 1:37:24.280
 No recordings, none of that.

1:37:24.280 --> 1:37:27.120
 Maybe a little here and there, but mostly just for me.

1:37:27.120 --> 1:37:34.080
 And to see, I don't know, sometimes it's just something pulls you to a place.

1:37:34.080 --> 1:37:41.000
 And I also, because I'm able to speak Russian and some Ukrainian, I do want to try to have

1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:45.560
 these, a couple of the political leaders involved, talk to them.

1:37:45.560 --> 1:37:49.240
 And I have all the right connections, everybody has said yes.

1:37:49.240 --> 1:37:53.240
 Of course you don't know the likelihood it finally happens, but I want to at least have

1:37:53.240 --> 1:37:54.880
 that possibility there.

1:37:54.880 --> 1:37:57.320
 Sometimes you have to go to a place to really understand it.

1:37:57.320 --> 1:37:58.320
 You can't just read about it.

1:37:58.320 --> 1:38:00.560
 You can't just talk to the people that are living there.

1:38:00.560 --> 1:38:02.440
 You have to be there.

1:38:02.440 --> 1:38:05.000
 And I've never been in a war zone.

1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:15.520
 I've never been in a land that's been damaged and wiped by the weapons of war.

1:38:15.520 --> 1:38:22.360
 And I just want to feel that because so much of that land is, I remember when everything

1:38:22.360 --> 1:38:23.360
 was flourishing.

1:38:23.360 --> 1:38:28.920
 Yes, corruption, all those kinds of things, but people were there and the culture was

1:38:28.920 --> 1:38:30.480
 flourishing and people were happy.

1:38:30.480 --> 1:38:32.520
 There was lots of struggle, but they were happy.

1:38:32.520 --> 1:38:34.920
 And now people are extremely angry.

1:38:34.920 --> 1:38:36.680
 There's hate in the air on all sides.

1:38:36.680 --> 1:38:38.600
 I want to see that.

1:38:38.600 --> 1:38:39.760
 I want to understand.

1:38:39.760 --> 1:38:42.080
 Sometimes it just pulls you and you have to go.

1:38:42.080 --> 1:38:46.040
 So it doesn't make any sense perhaps, but you just got to do it.

1:38:46.040 --> 1:38:48.720
 What's the timeline of when I'm going?

1:38:48.720 --> 1:38:49.720
 How long?

1:38:49.720 --> 1:38:50.720
 No, one way.

1:38:50.720 --> 1:38:51.720
 I don't have a plan.

1:38:51.720 --> 1:38:52.720
 Really?

1:38:52.720 --> 1:38:53.720
 Wow.

1:38:53.720 --> 1:38:54.720
 Yeah.

1:38:54.720 --> 1:39:06.560
 So I'm hoping back in a month, but also just to clarify, I'm not somebody who seeks risk.

1:39:06.560 --> 1:39:11.800
 And like, you're somebody who seems to be terrified of bears and sharks, so you don't

1:39:11.800 --> 1:39:14.840
 like, so why go swim out?

1:39:14.840 --> 1:39:15.840
 Why go surfing?

1:39:15.840 --> 1:39:16.840
 Why go swim out in the ocean?

1:39:16.840 --> 1:39:17.840
 Yeah.

1:39:17.840 --> 1:39:20.120
 So I'm somebody that's the same probably with sharks too.

1:39:20.120 --> 1:39:25.200
 I'm not taking unnecessary risk, but certain things that just mean a lot to you, you take

1:39:25.200 --> 1:39:26.200
 the risk.

1:39:26.200 --> 1:39:33.880
 And so a little bit of risk willing to take to discover something about myself, honestly,

1:39:33.880 --> 1:39:37.960
 it's probably what it all boils down to, trying to understand myself.

1:39:37.960 --> 1:39:40.880
 Because so much of me is from that place.

1:39:40.880 --> 1:39:47.160
 Well, this is the beautiful thing about America is it's like stitches together all these different

1:39:47.160 --> 1:39:48.160
 cultures.

1:39:48.160 --> 1:39:49.160
 Everybody came from somewhere else.

1:39:49.160 --> 1:39:50.160
 Yeah.

1:39:50.160 --> 1:39:55.680
 And you try to understand, in order for me to be a good American, I need to understand

1:39:55.680 --> 1:39:59.120
 who I was, where I came from.

1:39:59.120 --> 1:40:07.200
 And that's nothing reveals the spirit of a people better than war.

1:40:07.200 --> 1:40:13.800
 It's like there's something about this conflict that's really cuts all the bullshit.

1:40:13.800 --> 1:40:15.080
 This is who we are.

1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:16.840
 This is who we are as a people.

1:40:16.840 --> 1:40:18.520
 So I want to see it.

1:40:18.520 --> 1:40:19.520
 I want to understand.

1:40:19.520 --> 1:40:23.560
 And like I said, when I come back, drink some whiskey with you.

1:40:23.560 --> 1:40:24.560
 All right.

1:40:24.560 --> 1:40:25.560
 Well, I hope that happens.

1:40:25.560 --> 1:40:27.040
 I really do.

1:40:27.040 --> 1:40:28.480
 And I hope you're safe over there.

1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:34.280
 And I hope you come back with whatever insight you're trying to achieve.

1:40:34.280 --> 1:40:35.280
 Thank you for doing this conversation.

1:40:35.280 --> 1:40:36.280
 My pleasure, brother.

1:40:36.280 --> 1:40:40.480
 Thank you for everything you've done for me, for the support, for the love, and everybody

1:40:40.480 --> 1:40:41.480
 around you.

1:40:41.480 --> 1:40:46.200
 Thank you for everything you're doing for everybody around you, for giving back, but

1:40:46.200 --> 1:40:48.560
 for just giving and being kind to everybody.

1:40:48.560 --> 1:40:49.560
 I love you, brother.

1:40:49.560 --> 1:40:50.560
 I love you too.

1:40:50.560 --> 1:40:51.560
 Thank you.

1:40:51.560 --> 1:40:54.000
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Joe Rogan.

1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:57.840
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

1:40:57.840 --> 1:41:02.680
 And now let me leave you with one of Joe's and one of my favorite quotes from Miyamoto

1:41:02.680 --> 1:41:03.680
 Musashi.

1:41:03.680 --> 1:41:09.440
 Once you know the way broadly, you will see it in everything.

1:41:09.440 --> 1:41:21.120
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
