00:00.000 --> 00:02.520
 The following is a conversation with Tyler Cohen,

00:02.520 --> 00:05.000
 an economist at George Mason University

00:05.000 --> 00:08.200
 and co creator of an amazing economics blog

00:08.200 --> 00:11.520
 called Marginal Revolution, author of many books,

00:11.520 --> 00:14.840
 including The Great Stagnation, Average Is Over

00:14.840 --> 00:17.240
 and his most recent Big Business,

00:17.240 --> 00:20.240
 A Love Letter to an American Antihero.

00:20.240 --> 00:22.520
 He's truly a polymath in his work,

00:22.520 --> 00:24.280
 including his love for food,

00:24.280 --> 00:26.440
 which makes this amazing podcast

00:26.440 --> 00:29.960
 called Conversations with Tyler really fun to listen to.

00:30.880 --> 00:32.680
 Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:32.680 --> 00:37.380
 Linode, ExpressVPN, Simplisafe and Public Goods.

00:37.380 --> 00:41.040
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:41.040 --> 00:45.160
 As a side note, given Tyler's culinary explorations,

00:45.160 --> 00:48.380
 let me say that one of the things that makes me sad

00:48.380 --> 00:51.040
 about my love hate relationship with food

00:51.040 --> 00:53.840
 is that while I've found a simple diet,

00:53.840 --> 00:58.200
 plain meat, veggies, that makes me happy in day to day life,

00:58.200 --> 01:00.120
 I sometimes wish I had the mental ability

01:00.120 --> 01:02.040
 to moderate consumption of food

01:02.040 --> 01:03.760
 so that I could truly enjoy meals

01:03.760 --> 01:06.120
 that go way outside of that diet.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.520
 I've seen my mom, for example,

01:07.520 --> 01:09.680
 enjoy a single piece of chocolate

01:09.680 --> 01:12.500
 and yet if I were to eat one piece of chocolate,

01:12.500 --> 01:15.940
 the odds are high that I would end up eating the whole box.

01:15.940 --> 01:18.200
 This is definitely something I would like to fix

01:18.200 --> 01:21.840
 because some of the amazing artistry in this world

01:21.840 --> 01:24.160
 happens in the kitchen and some of the richest

01:24.160 --> 01:27.560
 human experiences happen over a unique meal.

01:27.560 --> 01:29.360
 I recently was eating cheeseburgers

01:29.360 --> 01:33.520
 with Joe Rogan and John Donahue late at night in Austin,

01:33.520 --> 01:35.680
 talking about jiu jitsu and life

01:35.680 --> 01:40.160
 and I was distinctly aware of the magic of that experience.

01:40.160 --> 01:42.640
 Magic made possible by the incredibly

01:42.640 --> 01:44.460
 delicious cheeseburgers.

01:44.460 --> 01:47.120
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast

01:47.120 --> 01:50.060
 and here is my conversation with Tyler Cohen.

01:50.060 --> 01:54.420
 Would you say economics is more art or science

01:54.420 --> 01:57.100
 or philosophy or even magic?

01:57.100 --> 01:58.120
 What is it?

01:58.120 --> 02:01.460
 Economics is interesting because it's all of the above.

02:01.460 --> 02:03.900
 To start with magic, the notion that you can

02:03.900 --> 02:06.620
 make some change and simply everyone's better off,

02:06.620 --> 02:08.420
 that is a kind of modern magic

02:08.420 --> 02:11.020
 that has replaced old style magic.

02:11.020 --> 02:14.620
 It's an art in the sense that the models are not very exact.

02:14.620 --> 02:16.580
 It's a science in the sense that occasionally

02:16.580 --> 02:18.540
 propositions are falsified.

02:18.540 --> 02:20.860
 Are a few basic things we know

02:20.860 --> 02:22.360
 and however trivial they may sound,

02:22.360 --> 02:24.580
 if you don't know them, you're out of luck.

02:24.580 --> 02:26.480
 So all of the above.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.580
 But from my outsider's perspective,

02:28.580 --> 02:33.580
 economics is sometimes able to formulate very simple,

02:33.740 --> 02:36.100
 almost like E equals MC squared,

02:36.100 --> 02:40.020
 general models of how our human society will function

02:40.020 --> 02:41.760
 when you do a certain thing.

02:42.800 --> 02:47.420
 But it seems impossible or almost way too optimistic

02:47.420 --> 02:49.420
 to think that a single formula

02:49.420 --> 02:51.620
 or just a set of simple principles

02:51.620 --> 02:56.460
 can describe behavior of billions of human beings

02:56.460 --> 02:58.620
 with all the complexity that we have involved.

02:58.620 --> 03:01.220
 So do you have a sense there's a hope for economics

03:01.220 --> 03:06.220
 to have those kinds of physics level descriptions

03:06.740 --> 03:08.100
 and models of the world?

03:08.100 --> 03:10.060
 Or is it just our desperate attempts as humans

03:10.060 --> 03:12.980
 to make sense of it even though it's more desperate

03:12.980 --> 03:17.980
 than rigorous and serious and actually predictable

03:17.980 --> 03:20.540
 like a physics type science?

03:20.540 --> 03:24.160
 I don't think economics will ever be very predictive.

03:24.160 --> 03:27.260
 It's most useful for helping you ask better questions.

03:27.260 --> 03:29.420
 You look at something like game theory.

03:29.420 --> 03:32.660
 Well, game theory never predicted USA and USSR

03:32.660 --> 03:35.060
 would have a war, would not have a war.

03:35.060 --> 03:38.140
 But trying to think through the logic of strategic conflict,

03:38.140 --> 03:39.460
 if you know game theory,

03:39.460 --> 03:42.500
 it's just a much more interesting discussion.

03:42.500 --> 03:44.540
 Are you surprised that we,

03:44.540 --> 03:47.420
 speaking of the Soviet Union and the United States

03:47.420 --> 03:48.780
 and speaking of game theory,

03:48.780 --> 03:50.900
 are you surprised that we haven't destroyed ourselves

03:50.900 --> 03:52.020
 with nuclear weapons yet?

03:52.020 --> 03:54.280
 Like that simple formulation

03:54.280 --> 03:56.300
 of mutually assured destruction,

03:56.300 --> 03:58.940
 that's a good example of an explanation

03:58.940 --> 04:02.340
 that perhaps allows us to ask better questions.

04:02.340 --> 04:06.100
 But it seems to have actually described the reality

04:06.100 --> 04:08.340
 of why we haven't destroyed ourselves

04:08.340 --> 04:10.820
 with these ultra powerful weapons.

04:10.820 --> 04:13.100
 Are you surprised, do you think

04:13.100 --> 04:16.880
 the game theoretic explanation is at all accurate there?

04:16.880 --> 04:19.920
 I think we will destroy each other with those weapons.

04:19.920 --> 04:20.760
 Eventually.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.940
 Eventually.

04:21.940 --> 04:24.320
 Look, it's a very low probability event.

04:24.320 --> 04:26.700
 So I'm not surprised it hasn't happened yet.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.500
 I'm a little surprised it came as close as it did.

04:29.500 --> 04:30.980
 You know, you're general thinking,

04:30.980 --> 04:33.100
 realizing it might've just been a flock of birds

04:33.100 --> 04:35.700
 or it wasn't a first strike attack from the USA.

04:35.700 --> 04:38.060
 We got very lucky on that one.

04:38.060 --> 04:39.940
 But if you just keep on running the clock

04:39.940 --> 04:42.900
 on a low probability event, it will happen.

04:42.900 --> 04:45.620
 And it may not be USA and China,

04:45.620 --> 04:47.160
 USA and Russia, whatever.

04:47.160 --> 04:49.200
 You know, it could be the Saudis and Turkey.

04:49.200 --> 04:50.580
 And it might not be nuclear weapons,

04:50.580 --> 04:51.580
 it might be some other destruction.

04:51.580 --> 04:52.740
 Bio weapons.

04:52.740 --> 04:55.580
 But it simply will happen is my view.

04:55.580 --> 04:58.820
 And I've argued at best we have 700 or 800 years

04:58.820 --> 05:00.240
 and that's being generous.

05:00.240 --> 05:01.080
 A worst?

05:01.080 --> 05:03.020
 How long we got?

05:03.020 --> 05:06.380
 Well, maybe it's like a post on arrival process, right?

05:06.380 --> 05:09.540
 So tiny probability could come any time.

05:09.540 --> 05:12.020
 Probably not in your lifetime.

05:12.020 --> 05:15.700
 But the chance presumably increases

05:15.700 --> 05:18.780
 the cheaper weapons of mass destruction are.

05:18.780 --> 05:22.380
 So the Poisson process description doesn't take

05:22.380 --> 05:24.340
 in consideration the game theoretic aspect.

05:24.340 --> 05:28.060
 So another way to consider is repeated games,

05:28.060 --> 05:29.700
 iterative games.

05:29.700 --> 05:33.440
 So is there something about our human nature

05:33.440 --> 05:37.260
 that allows us to fight against probability?

05:37.260 --> 05:40.940
 Reduce, like the closer we get to trouble,

05:40.940 --> 05:43.840
 the more we're able to figure out how to avoid trouble.

05:43.840 --> 05:46.140
 The same thing is for when you take exams

05:46.140 --> 05:48.700
 or you go and take classes,

05:48.700 --> 05:50.620
 the closer or paper deadlines,

05:50.620 --> 05:52.220
 the closer you get to a deadline,

05:52.220 --> 05:53.480
 the better you start to perform

05:53.480 --> 05:56.220
 and get your shit together and actually get stuff done.

05:56.220 --> 05:58.720
 I'm really not so negative on human nature.

05:58.720 --> 05:59.760
 And as an economist,

05:59.760 --> 06:02.900
 I very much see the gains from cooperation.

06:02.900 --> 06:05.260
 But if you just ask, are there outliers in history?

06:05.260 --> 06:07.100
 Like was there a Hitler, for instance?

06:07.100 --> 06:08.140
 Obviously.

06:08.140 --> 06:09.980
 And again, you let the clock tick,

06:09.980 --> 06:12.260
 another Hitler with nuclear weapons,

06:12.260 --> 06:15.140
 doesn't per se care about his own destruction,

06:15.140 --> 06:16.460
 it will happen.

06:16.460 --> 06:19.300
 So your sense is fundamentally people are good,

06:20.240 --> 06:21.080
 but outliers happen.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.480
 A trembling hand equilibrium is what we would call it.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.420
 Trembling hand equilibrium?

06:25.420 --> 06:28.460
 That the basic logic is for cooperation,

06:28.460 --> 06:32.420
 which is mostly what we've seen, even between enemies.

06:32.420 --> 06:35.020
 But every now and then someone does something crazy

06:35.020 --> 06:36.800
 and you don't know how to react to it.

06:36.800 --> 06:39.500
 And you can't always beat Hitler.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.680
 Sometimes Hitler drags you down.

06:41.680 --> 06:44.620
 To push back, is it possible

06:44.620 --> 06:48.880
 that the crazier the person, the less likely they are,

06:49.700 --> 06:52.900
 and in a way where we're safe,

06:52.900 --> 06:56.500
 meaning like, this is the kind of proposition,

06:56.500 --> 06:59.580
 I had the discussion with my dad as a physicist about this,

06:59.580 --> 07:04.580
 where he thinks that like if you have a graph,

07:04.580 --> 07:08.220
 like evil people can't also be geniuses.

07:08.220 --> 07:11.060
 So this is his defense why evil people

07:11.060 --> 07:13.380
 will not get control of nuclear weapons,

07:13.380 --> 07:15.000
 because to be truly evil.

07:15.940 --> 07:19.700
 But evil meaning sort of, you can argue that,

07:19.700 --> 07:22.420
 not even the evil of Hitler we're talking about,

07:22.420 --> 07:24.500
 because Hitler had a kind of view of Germany

07:24.500 --> 07:26.460
 and all those kinds of, there's like,

07:26.460 --> 07:29.540
 he probably deluded himself and the people around him

07:29.540 --> 07:31.340
 to think that he's actually doing good for the world,

07:31.340 --> 07:33.180
 similar with Stalin and so on.

07:33.180 --> 07:35.740
 By evil, I mean more like almost like terrorists

07:35.740 --> 07:39.820
 to where they wanna destroy themselves and the world.

07:39.820 --> 07:42.820
 Like those people will never be able to be

07:42.820 --> 07:44.820
 actually skilled enough to do,

07:44.820 --> 07:47.880
 to deliver that kind of mass scale destruction.

07:47.880 --> 07:52.720
 So the hope is that it's very unlikely

07:52.720 --> 07:55.460
 that the kind of evil that would lead to extinctions

07:55.460 --> 07:59.500
 of humans or mass destruction is so unlikely

07:59.500 --> 08:03.680
 that we're able to last way longer than some 100, 800 years.

08:03.680 --> 08:04.520
 Is that?

08:04.520 --> 08:06.060
 It's very unlikely.

08:06.060 --> 08:08.180
 In that sense, I accept the argument,

08:08.180 --> 08:10.540
 but that's why you need to let the clock tick.

08:10.540 --> 08:13.180
 It's also the best argument for bureaucracy.

08:13.180 --> 08:14.760
 To negotiate a bureaucracy,

08:14.760 --> 08:16.980
 it actually selects against pure evil

08:16.980 --> 08:18.860
 because you need to build alliances.

08:18.860 --> 08:21.020
 So bureaucracy in that regard is great, right?

08:21.020 --> 08:23.300
 It keeps out the worst apples.

08:23.300 --> 08:24.340
 But look, put it this way,

08:24.340 --> 08:26.980
 could you imagine 35 years from now,

08:26.980 --> 08:29.680
 the Osama bin Laden of the future

08:29.680 --> 08:32.540
 has nukes or very bad bio weapons?

08:32.540 --> 08:34.180
 It seems to me you can.

08:34.180 --> 08:36.020
 And Osama was pretty evil.

08:36.020 --> 08:38.720
 And actually even he failed, right?

08:38.720 --> 08:41.780
 But nonetheless, that's what the 700 or 800 years

08:41.780 --> 08:42.980
 is there for.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.940
 And there might be destructive technologies

08:44.940 --> 08:48.660
 that don't have such a high cost of production

08:48.660 --> 08:50.740
 or such a high learning curve.

08:50.740 --> 08:53.940
 Like cyber attacks or artificial intelligence,

08:53.940 --> 08:55.620
 all those kinds of things.

08:55.620 --> 08:56.460
 Yeah.

08:56.460 --> 08:57.580
 I mean, let me ask you a question.

08:57.580 --> 09:00.060
 Let's say you could as an act of will,

09:00.060 --> 09:01.660
 by spending a million dollars,

09:01.660 --> 09:05.300
 obliterate any city on earth and everyone in it dies.

09:05.300 --> 09:08.460
 And you'll get caught and you'll be sentenced to death,

09:08.460 --> 09:10.980
 but you can make it happen just by willing it.

09:10.980 --> 09:13.980
 How many months does it take before that happens?

09:15.900 --> 09:18.020
 So the obvious answer is like very soon.

09:18.020 --> 09:19.420
 There's probably a good answer for that

09:19.420 --> 09:21.460
 because you can consider how many millionaires there are,

09:21.460 --> 09:22.740
 how many you could look at that, right?

09:22.740 --> 09:23.660
 Right.

09:23.660 --> 09:26.620
 I have a sense that there's just people

09:26.620 --> 09:28.620
 that have a million dollars.

09:30.220 --> 09:31.420
 I mean, there's a certain amount,

09:31.420 --> 09:33.660
 but have a million dollars,

09:33.660 --> 09:36.820
 have other interests that will outweigh

09:39.020 --> 09:42.020
 the interest of destroying an entire city.

09:42.020 --> 09:43.980
 Like there's a particular,

09:43.980 --> 09:46.620
 like, I mean, maybe that's a hope.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.900
 It's why we should be nice to the wealthy too, right?

09:48.900 --> 09:51.300
 Yeah.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.900
 Yeah, all that trash talking as Bill Gates,

09:53.900 --> 09:54.780
 we should stop that

09:54.780 --> 09:58.580
 because that doesn't inspire the other future Bill Gates

09:58.580 --> 10:00.100
 is to be nice to the world.

10:01.020 --> 10:01.940
 That's true.

10:01.940 --> 10:05.380
 But your sense is the cheaper it gets to destroy the world,

10:05.380 --> 10:07.460
 the more likely it becomes.

10:07.460 --> 10:08.900
 Now, when I say destroy the world,

10:08.900 --> 10:09.740
 there's a trick in there.

10:09.740 --> 10:12.740
 I don't think literally every human will die,

10:12.740 --> 10:14.940
 but it would set back civilization

10:14.940 --> 10:16.380
 by an extraordinary degree.

10:16.380 --> 10:19.260
 It's then just hard to predict what comes next.

10:19.260 --> 10:21.580
 But a catastrophe where everyone dies,

10:21.580 --> 10:24.100
 that probably has to be something more like an asteroid

10:24.100 --> 10:26.140
 or supernova.

10:26.140 --> 10:29.660
 And those are purely exogenous for the time being, at least.

10:29.660 --> 10:32.180
 So I immigrated to this country.

10:32.180 --> 10:36.100
 I was born in the Soviet Union in Russia and...

10:36.100 --> 10:37.140
 Which one?

10:37.140 --> 10:37.980
 Which one?

10:37.980 --> 10:39.620
 I guess it's an important question.

10:39.620 --> 10:41.460
 You were born in the Soviet Union, right?

10:41.460 --> 10:43.340
 Yes, I was born in the Soviet Union.

10:43.340 --> 10:47.500
 The rest is details, but I grew up in Moscow, Russia.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.860
 But I came to this country,

10:49.860 --> 10:52.140
 and this country even back there,

10:52.140 --> 10:55.820
 but it's always symbolized to me a place of opportunity

10:55.820 --> 11:00.820
 where everybody could build the most incredible things,

11:01.140 --> 11:03.380
 especially in the engineering side of things.

11:03.380 --> 11:06.540
 Just invent and build and scale

11:06.540 --> 11:08.700
 and have a huge impact on the world.

11:08.700 --> 11:11.060
 And that's been, to me, the...

11:11.060 --> 11:14.060
 That's my version of the American ideal, the American dream.

11:14.060 --> 11:19.060
 Do you think the American dream is still there?

11:20.340 --> 11:21.180
 Do you think...

11:21.180 --> 11:23.540
 What do you think of that notion in itself,

11:23.540 --> 11:25.180
 like from an economics perspective,

11:25.180 --> 11:28.180
 from a human perspective, is it still alive?

11:28.180 --> 11:30.020
 And how do you think about it?

11:30.020 --> 11:30.860
 The American dream.

11:30.860 --> 11:33.540
 The American dream is mostly still there.

11:33.540 --> 11:37.340
 If you look at which groups are the highest earners,

11:37.340 --> 11:41.340
 it is individuals from India and individuals from Iran,

11:41.340 --> 11:43.300
 which is a fairly new development.

11:43.300 --> 11:45.940
 Great for them, not necessarily easy.

11:45.940 --> 11:48.540
 Both you could call persons of color,

11:48.540 --> 11:50.300
 may have faced discrimination,

11:50.300 --> 11:53.780
 also on the grounds of religion, yet they've done it.

11:53.780 --> 11:54.620
 That's amazing.

11:54.620 --> 11:56.540
 It says great things about America.

11:56.540 --> 11:58.580
 Now, if you look at native born Americans,

11:58.580 --> 12:00.580
 the story's trickier.

12:00.580 --> 12:03.660
 People think intergenerational mobility

12:03.660 --> 12:05.260
 has declined a lot recently,

12:05.260 --> 12:08.580
 but it has not for native born Americans.

12:08.580 --> 12:11.820
 For about, I think, 40 years, it's been fairly constant,

12:11.820 --> 12:13.700
 which is sort of good,

12:13.700 --> 12:16.900
 but compared to much earlier times,

12:16.900 --> 12:19.340
 it was much higher in the past.

12:19.340 --> 12:20.940
 I'm not sure we can replicate that,

12:20.940 --> 12:23.460
 because look, go to the beginning of the 20th century,

12:23.460 --> 12:25.660
 very few Americans finish high school,

12:26.700 --> 12:27.860
 or even have much wealth.

12:27.860 --> 12:29.180
 There's not much credentialism.

12:29.180 --> 12:30.860
 There aren't that many credentials.

12:30.860 --> 12:33.020
 So there's more upward mobility

12:33.020 --> 12:35.660
 across the generations than today.

12:35.660 --> 12:37.300
 And it's a good thing that we had it.

12:37.300 --> 12:40.140
 I'm not sure we should blame the modern world

12:40.140 --> 12:43.300
 for not being able to reproduce that.

12:43.300 --> 12:45.460
 But look, the general issue of

12:45.460 --> 12:47.660
 who gets into Harvard or Cornell?

12:47.660 --> 12:49.340
 Is there an injustice?

12:49.340 --> 12:50.700
 Should we fix that?

12:50.700 --> 12:52.780
 Is there too little opportunity for the bottom,

12:52.780 --> 12:54.340
 say, half of Americans?

12:54.340 --> 12:55.460
 Absolutely.

12:55.460 --> 12:58.740
 It's a disgrace how this country has evolved in that way.

12:58.740 --> 13:01.940
 And in that sense, the American dream is clearly ailing.

13:01.940 --> 13:04.420
 But it has had problems from the beginning,

13:04.420 --> 13:07.100
 for blacks, for women, for many other groups.

13:07.100 --> 13:10.060
 I mean, isn't that the whole challenge of opportunity

13:10.060 --> 13:12.060
 and freedom is that it's hard,

13:12.060 --> 13:16.780
 and the difficulty of how hard it is to move up in society

13:16.780 --> 13:20.260
 is unequal often, and that's the injustice of society.

13:20.260 --> 13:23.100
 But the whole point of that freedom

13:23.100 --> 13:25.660
 is that over time, it becomes better and better.

13:25.660 --> 13:30.660
 You start to fix the leaks, the issues,

13:31.300 --> 13:35.140
 and it keeps progressing in that kind of way.

13:35.140 --> 13:37.340
 But ultimately, there's always the opportunity,

13:37.340 --> 13:39.860
 even if it's harder, there's the opportunity

13:39.860 --> 13:41.780
 to create something truly special,

13:41.780 --> 13:46.660
 to move up, to be president, to be a leader

13:46.660 --> 13:49.020
 in whatever the industry that you're passionate about.

13:49.020 --> 13:51.460
 We each have podcasts, right, in English.

13:51.460 --> 13:56.060
 The value of joining that American English language network

13:56.060 --> 13:58.260
 is much higher today than it was 30 years ago,

13:58.260 --> 14:00.300
 mostly because of the internet.

14:00.300 --> 14:03.860
 So that makes immigration returns themselves skewed.

14:03.860 --> 14:07.180
 So going to the US, Canada, or the UK,

14:07.180 --> 14:09.940
 I think has become much more valuable in relative terms

14:09.940 --> 14:11.340
 than, say, going to France,

14:11.340 --> 14:13.860
 which is still a pretty well off, very nice country.

14:16.580 --> 14:17.700
 If you had gone to France,

14:17.700 --> 14:20.180
 your chance of having a globally known podcast

14:20.180 --> 14:21.740
 would be much smaller.

14:21.740 --> 14:23.700
 Yeah, this is the interesting thing

14:24.820 --> 14:27.660
 about how much intellectual influence

14:27.660 --> 14:28.580
 the United States has.

14:28.580 --> 14:31.940
 I don't know if it's connected to what we're discussing here,

14:31.940 --> 14:34.980
 the freedom and opportunity of the American dream,

14:34.980 --> 14:37.380
 or does it make any sense to you

14:37.380 --> 14:41.300
 that we have so much impact on the rest of the world

14:41.300 --> 14:44.100
 in terms of ideas?

14:45.500 --> 14:47.540
 Is it just simply because English

14:47.540 --> 14:49.740
 is the primary language of the world,

14:49.740 --> 14:52.100
 or is there something fundamental to the United States

14:52.100 --> 14:55.500
 that drives the development of ideas?

14:55.500 --> 14:59.780
 It's almost like what's cool, what's entertaining,

14:59.780 --> 15:04.780
 what's like meme culture, the internet culture,

15:06.220 --> 15:09.220
 the philosophers, the intellectuals, the podcasts,

15:09.220 --> 15:13.300
 the movies, music, all that stuff, driving culture.

15:13.300 --> 15:15.140
 There's something above and beyond language

15:15.140 --> 15:16.620
 in the United States.

15:16.620 --> 15:19.140
 It's a sense of entertainment really mattering,

15:19.140 --> 15:20.940
 how to connect with your audience,

15:20.940 --> 15:22.860
 being direct and getting to the point,

15:23.700 --> 15:27.260
 how humor is integrated even with science

15:27.260 --> 15:30.300
 that is pretty strongly represented here,

15:30.300 --> 15:32.660
 much more so than on the European continent.

15:32.660 --> 15:34.300
 Britain has its own version of this,

15:34.300 --> 15:36.140
 which it does very well,

15:36.140 --> 15:38.340
 and not surprisingly, they're hugely influential

15:38.340 --> 15:41.940
 in music, comedy, most of the other areas you mentioned.

15:41.940 --> 15:44.820
 Canada, yes, but their best talent tends to come here,

15:44.820 --> 15:47.980
 but you could say it's like a broader North American thing

15:47.980 --> 15:50.220
 and give them their fair share of credit.

15:50.220 --> 15:52.180
 What about science?

15:52.180 --> 15:56.700
 There's a sense higher education is really strong,

15:56.700 --> 15:58.660
 research is really strong in the United States,

15:58.660 --> 16:01.940
 but it just feels like, culturally speaking,

16:01.940 --> 16:06.060
 when we zoom out, scientists aren't very cool here.

16:07.540 --> 16:09.460
 Most people wouldn't be able to name

16:09.460 --> 16:11.180
 basically a single scientist.

16:11.180 --> 16:13.260
 Maybe they would say like, they would say what,

16:13.260 --> 16:16.620
 like Einstein and Neil deGrasse Tyson maybe,

16:16.620 --> 16:18.820
 and Neil deGrasse Tyson isn't exactly a scientist,

16:18.820 --> 16:20.420
 he's a science communicator.

16:20.420 --> 16:25.420
 So there's not the same kind of admiration

16:25.420 --> 16:30.060
 of science and innovators as there is of like,

16:30.060 --> 16:34.980
 athletes or actors, actresses, musicians.

16:34.980 --> 16:38.060
 Well, you can become a celebrity scientist if you want to.

16:38.060 --> 16:40.180
 It may or may not be best for science.

16:40.180 --> 16:44.340
 And we have Spock from Star Trek, who is still a big deal,

16:44.340 --> 16:45.780
 but look at it this way.

16:45.780 --> 16:47.420
 Which country is most comfortable

16:47.420 --> 16:50.900
 with inegalitarian rewards for scientists,

16:50.900 --> 16:52.420
 whether it's fame or money?

16:52.420 --> 16:53.420
 And I still think it's here.

16:53.420 --> 16:55.380
 Some of that's just the tax rate.

16:55.380 --> 16:57.700
 Some of it is a lot of America is set up

16:57.700 --> 17:00.220
 for rich people to live really well.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.740
 And again, that's going to attract a lot of top talent.

17:02.740 --> 17:05.220
 And you ask like, the two best vaccines.

17:05.220 --> 17:08.020
 I know the Pfizer vaccine is sort of from Germany,

17:08.020 --> 17:11.180
 sort of from Turkey, but it's nonetheless

17:11.180 --> 17:13.260
 being distributed through the United States.

17:13.260 --> 17:17.860
 Moderna, an ethnic Armenian immigrant through Lebanon,

17:17.860 --> 17:21.380
 first to Canada, then down here to Boston, Cambridge area.

17:21.380 --> 17:22.820
 Those are incredible vaccines.

17:22.820 --> 17:25.180
 And US nailed it.

17:25.180 --> 17:28.780
 Yeah, well, that's more almost like the,

17:28.780 --> 17:29.940
 I don't know what you would call it,

17:29.940 --> 17:32.700
 engineering, the sort of scaling.

17:32.700 --> 17:34.660
 That's what US is really good at,

17:34.660 --> 17:36.100
 not just inventing of ideas,

17:36.100 --> 17:38.220
 but taking an idea and actually building the thing

17:38.220 --> 17:41.620
 and scaling it and being able to distribute it at scale.

17:42.580 --> 17:44.980
 I think some people would attribute that

17:44.980 --> 17:49.580
 to the general word of capitalism.

17:49.580 --> 17:51.260
 I don't know if you would.

17:51.260 --> 17:52.100
 Sure.

17:52.100 --> 17:57.100
 What in your views are the pros and cons of capitalism

17:57.500 --> 17:59.740
 as it's implemented in America?

17:59.740 --> 18:00.620
 I don't know if you would say

18:00.620 --> 18:03.140
 capitalism really exists in America,

18:03.140 --> 18:04.820
 but to the extent that it does.

18:04.820 --> 18:08.380
 People use the word capitalism in so many different ways.

18:08.380 --> 18:09.820
 What is capitalism?

18:09.820 --> 18:13.500
 The literal meaning is private ownership of capital goods,

18:13.500 --> 18:15.940
 which I favor in most areas.

18:15.940 --> 18:17.700
 But no, I don't think the private sector

18:17.700 --> 18:20.840
 should own our F16s or military assets.

18:20.840 --> 18:23.860
 Government owned water utilities seem to work

18:23.860 --> 18:26.820
 as well as privately owned water utilities.

18:26.820 --> 18:29.620
 But with all those qualifications put to the side,

18:30.980 --> 18:33.740
 business, for the most part,

18:33.740 --> 18:35.280
 innovates better than government.

18:35.280 --> 18:38.120
 It is oriented toward consumer services.

18:38.120 --> 18:41.260
 The biggest businesses tend to pay the highest wages.

18:41.260 --> 18:43.660
 Business is great at getting things done.

18:43.660 --> 18:46.500
 USA is fundamentally a nation of business

18:46.500 --> 18:49.140
 and that makes us a nation of opportunity.

18:49.140 --> 18:51.780
 So I am indeed mostly a fan.

18:51.780 --> 18:54.000
 Subject to numerous caveats.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.300
 What's the con?

18:56.300 --> 18:59.140
 What are some negative downsides of capitalism

19:00.300 --> 19:03.860
 in your view or some things that we should be concerned

19:03.860 --> 19:06.320
 about maybe for longterm impacts of capitalism?

19:07.740 --> 19:10.860
 Again, capitalism takes a different form in each country.

19:10.860 --> 19:12.940
 I would say in the United States,

19:12.940 --> 19:16.120
 our weird blend of whatever you want to call it

19:16.120 --> 19:20.160
 has had an enduring racial problem from the beginning,

19:20.160 --> 19:22.740
 has been a force of taking away land

19:22.740 --> 19:25.460
 from Native Americans and oppressing them

19:25.460 --> 19:27.180
 pretty much from the beginning.

19:30.180 --> 19:34.060
 It has done very well by immigrants for the most part.

19:35.020 --> 19:38.960
 We revel in championitarian creative destruction more.

19:38.960 --> 19:42.260
 So we don't just prop up national champions forever.

19:42.260 --> 19:45.440
 And there's a precariousness to life for some people here

19:45.440 --> 19:48.980
 that is less so say in Germany or the Netherlands.

19:48.980 --> 19:51.780
 We have weaker communities in some regards

19:51.780 --> 19:54.460
 than say Northwestern Europe often would.

19:54.460 --> 19:55.860
 That has pluses and minuses.

19:55.860 --> 19:57.780
 I think it makes us more creative.

19:57.780 --> 20:00.420
 It's a better country in which to be a weirdo

20:00.420 --> 20:02.380
 than say Germany or Denmark.

20:02.380 --> 20:05.500
 But there is truly, whether from the government

20:05.500 --> 20:06.980
 or from your private community,

20:06.980 --> 20:10.060
 there is less social security in some fundamental sense.

20:10.060 --> 20:11.500
 On the point of weirdo,

20:11.500 --> 20:15.380
 what, that's kind of a beautiful little statement.

20:16.340 --> 20:19.460
 What is that?

20:19.460 --> 20:21.460
 I mean, that seems to be, you know,

20:21.460 --> 20:23.580
 you could think of a guy like Elon Musk

20:23.580 --> 20:25.180
 and say that he's a weirdo.

20:25.180 --> 20:27.180
 Is that the sense in which you're using weirdo

20:27.180 --> 20:30.420
 like outside of the norm, like breaking conventions?

20:30.420 --> 20:31.260
 Absolutely.

20:31.260 --> 20:35.340
 And here that is either acceptable or even admired

20:35.340 --> 20:36.700
 or to be a loner.

20:36.700 --> 20:39.380
 And since so many people are outsiders

20:39.380 --> 20:41.980
 and that we're all immigrants is selecting for people

20:41.980 --> 20:43.200
 who left something behind,

20:43.200 --> 20:45.480
 we're willing to leave behind their families,

20:45.480 --> 20:48.220
 we're willing to undergo a certain brutality

20:48.220 --> 20:50.760
 of switch in their lives,

20:50.760 --> 20:55.020
 makes us a nation of weirdos and weirdos are creative.

20:55.020 --> 20:58.060
 And Denmark is not a nation of weirdos.

20:58.060 --> 21:01.100
 It's a wonderful place, you know, great for them.

21:01.100 --> 21:02.580
 Ideally you want part of the world

21:02.580 --> 21:04.460
 to be full of weirdos and innovating.

21:04.460 --> 21:06.500
 And the other part of the world to be a little

21:06.500 --> 21:09.660
 kind of chicken shit, risk averse

21:09.660 --> 21:12.020
 and enjoy the benefit to the innovation

21:12.020 --> 21:13.980
 and to give people these smooth lives

21:13.980 --> 21:16.580
 and six weeks off and free ride.

21:16.580 --> 21:19.340
 And everyone's like, oh, American way versus European way,

21:19.340 --> 21:21.500
 but basically they're compliments.

21:21.500 --> 21:22.420
 Yeah, that's fascinating.

21:22.420 --> 21:25.660
 I used to have this conversation with my like parents

21:25.660 --> 21:27.460
 when I was growing up and just others

21:27.460 --> 21:29.840
 from the immigrant kind of flow.

21:29.840 --> 21:32.780
 And they use this term, especially in Russian is,

21:32.780 --> 21:36.500
 you know, to criticize something I was doing,

21:36.500 --> 21:39.400
 that was suggest, you know, normal people don't do this.

21:41.120 --> 21:43.500
 And I used to be really offended by that,

21:44.500 --> 21:46.440
 but, you know, as I got older,

21:48.340 --> 21:51.340
 I realized that that's a kind of compliment

21:51.340 --> 21:55.680
 because in the same kind of, I would say,

21:56.740 --> 21:59.860
 way that you're saying that is the American ideal,

21:59.860 --> 22:02.760
 because if you want to do anything special or interesting,

22:02.760 --> 22:06.340
 you don't want to be doing in one particular avenue

22:06.340 --> 22:11.340
 what normal people do, because that won't be interesting.

22:12.380 --> 22:14.860
 Russians, I think fit in very well here

22:14.860 --> 22:16.780
 because the ones who come are weirdos.

22:16.780 --> 22:19.100
 And there's a very different Russian weirdo tradition

22:19.100 --> 22:20.340
 like Alyosha, right?

22:20.340 --> 22:21.940
 And by this card, I miss off.

22:21.940 --> 22:25.060
 Or Perelman, the mathematician, they're weirdos.

22:25.060 --> 22:27.860
 And they have their own different kind of status

22:27.860 --> 22:30.740
 in Soviet Union, Russia, wherever.

22:30.740 --> 22:32.380
 And when Russians come to America,

22:32.380 --> 22:35.180
 they stay pretty Russian, but it seems to me a week later,

22:35.180 --> 22:38.020
 they've somehow adjusted.

22:38.020 --> 22:40.860
 And the ways in which they might want to be like grumpier

22:40.860 --> 22:42.260
 than Americans, not smile,

22:42.260 --> 22:44.200
 think that people who smile are idiots,

22:44.200 --> 22:45.220
 like they can do that.

22:45.220 --> 22:46.980
 No one takes that away from them.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.700
 What are you, on a tiny tangent,

22:50.700 --> 22:52.220
 I'd love to hear if you have thoughts

22:52.220 --> 22:57.060
 about Grisha Perelman turning down the Fields Medal.

22:57.060 --> 22:59.180
 Is that something you admire?

22:59.180 --> 23:02.100
 Does that make sense to you that somebody,

23:02.100 --> 23:04.160
 you know, with the structure of Nobel Prizes,

23:04.160 --> 23:06.340
 of these huge awards, of the reputations,

23:06.340 --> 23:09.240
 the hierarchy of everyone saying, applauding,

23:09.240 --> 23:12.060
 how special you are, and here's a person

23:12.060 --> 23:14.820
 who was doing one of the greatest accomplishments

23:14.820 --> 23:16.160
 in the history of mathematics.

23:16.160 --> 23:17.660
 It doesn't want the stupid prize

23:17.660 --> 23:19.380
 and doesn't want recognition,

23:19.380 --> 23:20.580
 doesn't want to do interviews,

23:20.580 --> 23:22.020
 it doesn't want to be famous.

23:22.020 --> 23:24.140
 What do you make of that?

23:24.140 --> 23:24.980
 It's great.

23:24.980 --> 23:26.880
 Look, prizes are corrupting.

23:26.880 --> 23:28.940
 After scientists win Nobel Prizes,

23:28.940 --> 23:31.220
 they tend to become less productive.

23:31.220 --> 23:32.960
 Now, statistically, it's hard to sort out

23:32.960 --> 23:33.800
 the different effects.

23:33.800 --> 23:35.340
 There's aggression toward the mean.

23:35.340 --> 23:36.660
 Does the prize make you too busy?

23:36.660 --> 23:38.060
 It's a little tricky, but.

23:38.060 --> 23:39.900
 There's not enough Nobel Prizes either

23:39.900 --> 23:41.780
 to gather enough data.

23:41.780 --> 23:45.260
 Right, but I've known a lot of Nobel Prize winners,

23:45.260 --> 23:47.780
 and it is my sense they become less productive.

23:47.780 --> 23:49.580
 They repeat more of their older messages,

23:49.580 --> 23:52.220
 which may be highly socially valuable,

23:52.220 --> 23:54.960
 but if someone wants to turn their back on that

23:54.960 --> 23:58.300
 and keep on working, which I assume is what he's doing,

23:58.300 --> 23:59.400
 that's awesome.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.300
 I mean, we should respect that.

24:01.300 --> 24:02.980
 It's like he wins a bigger prize, right?

24:02.980 --> 24:04.460
 Our extreme respect.

24:04.460 --> 24:05.280
 Yeah.

24:06.560 --> 24:07.820
 Wow.

24:07.820 --> 24:10.700
 Grisha, if you're listening, I need to talk to you soon.

24:10.700 --> 24:11.540
 Okay.

24:11.540 --> 24:15.140
 I've been trying to get ahold of him.

24:15.140 --> 24:15.960
 Okay.

24:17.580 --> 24:18.460
 Back to capitalism.

24:18.460 --> 24:20.720
 I gotta ask you, just competition in general,

24:20.720 --> 24:22.560
 in this world of weirdos,

24:22.560 --> 24:24.820
 is competition good for the world?

24:24.820 --> 24:29.820
 This kind of seems to be one of the fundamental engines

24:29.940 --> 24:31.100
 of capitalism, right?

24:31.100 --> 24:32.860
 Do you see it as ultimately constructive

24:32.860 --> 24:34.860
 or destructive for the world?

24:34.860 --> 24:37.660
 What really matters is how good your legal framework is.

24:37.660 --> 24:40.820
 So competition within nature for food

24:40.820 --> 24:42.500
 leads to bloody conflict all the time.

24:42.500 --> 24:46.300
 The animal world is quite unpleasant, to say the least.

24:46.300 --> 24:49.860
 If you have something like the rule of law

24:49.860 --> 24:52.060
 and clearly defined property rights,

24:52.060 --> 24:54.780
 which are within reason justly allocated,

24:56.100 --> 24:58.960
 competition probably is gonna work very well.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.460
 But it's not an unalloyed good thing at all.

25:01.460 --> 25:02.900
 It can be highly destructive.

25:02.900 --> 25:05.300
 Military competition, right?

25:05.300 --> 25:07.820
 Which actually is itself sometimes good,

25:07.820 --> 25:09.380
 but it's not good per se.

25:09.380 --> 25:11.340
 What aspects of life do you think

25:11.340 --> 25:13.820
 we should protect from competition?

25:13.820 --> 25:16.620
 Is there some, you said like the rule of law,

25:16.620 --> 25:19.780
 is there some things we should keep away from competition?

25:19.780 --> 25:22.180
 Well, the fight for territory, most of all, right?

25:22.180 --> 25:24.220
 So violence, anything that involves

25:24.220 --> 25:25.780
 like actual physical violence.

25:25.780 --> 25:26.860
 Right, and it's not that I think

25:26.860 --> 25:28.140
 the current borders are just.

25:28.140 --> 25:31.860
 I mean, go talk to Hungarians, Romanians,

25:31.860 --> 25:34.500
 Serbians, Bosnians, they'll talk your ear off.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.720
 And some of them are probably right.

25:36.720 --> 25:37.660
 But at the end of the day,

25:37.660 --> 25:40.620
 we have some kind of international order.

25:40.620 --> 25:43.200
 And I would rather we more or less stick with it.

25:44.380 --> 25:46.860
 If Catalonians wanna leave, they keep up with it,

25:46.860 --> 25:48.420
 let them go, but.

25:48.420 --> 25:50.500
 What about a space of like healthcare?

25:50.500 --> 25:52.660
 This is where you get into a tension of like

25:52.660 --> 25:55.500
 between capitalism and kind of more,

25:56.500 --> 25:57.900
 I don't wanna use socialism,

25:57.900 --> 26:02.620
 but those kinds of policies that are less free market.

26:02.620 --> 26:03.460
 I think in this country,

26:03.460 --> 26:06.020
 healthcare should be much more competitive.

26:06.020 --> 26:07.580
 So you go to hospitals, doctors,

26:07.580 --> 26:10.020
 they don't treat you like a customer.

26:10.020 --> 26:11.980
 They treat you like an idiot or like a child

26:11.980 --> 26:14.520
 or someone with third party payment.

26:14.520 --> 26:18.840
 And it's a pretty humiliating experience often.

26:18.840 --> 26:19.680
 Yeah.

26:19.680 --> 26:22.860
 Do you think a free market in general is possible?

26:22.860 --> 26:25.160
 Like a pure free market?

26:25.160 --> 26:28.260
 And is that a good goal to strive for?

26:28.260 --> 26:31.300
 I don't think the term pure free market's well defined

26:31.300 --> 26:33.020
 because you need a legal order.

26:33.020 --> 26:35.100
 Legal order has to make decisions

26:35.100 --> 26:37.020
 on like what is intellectual property

26:37.020 --> 26:38.520
 more important than ever.

26:38.520 --> 26:40.500
 There's no benchmark that like represents

26:40.500 --> 26:43.800
 the pure free market way of doing things.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.460
 What will penalties be?

26:45.460 --> 26:47.840
 How much do we put into law enforcement?

26:47.840 --> 26:50.780
 No simple answers, but just saying free market

26:50.780 --> 26:52.380
 doesn't pin down what you're gonna do

26:52.380 --> 26:53.980
 on those all important questions.

26:53.980 --> 26:56.980
 So free market is an economics, I guess, idea.

26:56.980 --> 27:01.220
 So it's not possible for free market to generate the rules

27:01.220 --> 27:03.780
 that are like emergent, like self governing?

27:03.780 --> 27:05.320
 It generates a lot of them, right?

27:05.320 --> 27:08.140
 Through private norms, through trade associations.

27:08.140 --> 27:13.140
 International trade is mostly done privately and by norms.

27:13.140 --> 27:16.020
 So it's certainly possible, but at the end of the day,

27:16.020 --> 27:19.940
 I think you need governments to draw very clear lines

27:19.940 --> 27:24.180
 to prevent it from turning into mafia run systems.

27:24.180 --> 27:29.180
 You know, I've been hanging out with other group of weirdos,

27:29.340 --> 27:34.340
 lately Michael Malice, who espouses to be an anarchist,

27:34.760 --> 27:39.440
 anarchism, which is like, I think intellectually

27:39.440 --> 27:44.440
 just a fascinating set of ideas, where taking free market

27:46.300 --> 27:48.580
 to the full extreme of basically saying

27:48.580 --> 27:53.580
 there should be no government, what is it?

27:54.260 --> 27:57.740
 Oversight, I guess, and then everything should be fully,

27:57.740 --> 28:00.340
 like all the agreements, all the collectives you form

28:00.340 --> 28:05.340
 should be voluntary, not based on the geographic land

28:05.660 --> 28:07.460
 you were born on and so on.

28:07.460 --> 28:10.900
 Do you think that's just a giant mess?

28:10.900 --> 28:13.620
 Like, do you think it's possible for an anarchist society

28:13.620 --> 28:18.620
 to work where it's, you know, in a fully distributed way,

28:18.940 --> 28:20.500
 people agree with each other,

28:20.500 --> 28:22.700
 not just on financial transactions,

28:22.700 --> 28:27.700
 but you know, on their personal security,

28:28.060 --> 28:31.940
 on sort of military type of stuff, on healthcare,

28:31.940 --> 28:34.100
 on education, all those kinds of things.

28:34.100 --> 28:35.700
 And where does it break down?

28:35.700 --> 28:37.660
 Well, I wouldn't press a button to say get rid

28:37.660 --> 28:40.540
 of our current constitution, which I view is pretty good

28:40.540 --> 28:43.060
 and quite wise, but I think the deeper point

28:43.060 --> 28:47.220
 is that all societies are in some regards anarchistic

28:47.220 --> 28:49.100
 and we should take the anarchists seriously.

28:49.100 --> 28:53.580
 So globally, there's a kind of anarchy across borders,

28:53.580 --> 28:57.260
 even within federalistic systems, they're typically complex.

28:57.260 --> 29:00.340
 There's not a clear transitivity necessarily

29:00.340 --> 29:03.140
 of who has the final say over what,

29:03.140 --> 29:05.300
 just the state vis a vis its people.

29:05.300 --> 29:09.060
 There's not per se a final arbitrator in that regard.

29:09.060 --> 29:13.060
 So you want a good anarchy rather than a bad anarchy.

29:13.060 --> 29:15.980
 You wanna squish your anarchy into the right corners.

29:15.980 --> 29:18.420
 And I don't think there's a theoretical answer

29:18.420 --> 29:20.660
 how to do it, but you start with a country,

29:20.660 --> 29:23.540
 like is it working well enough now?

29:23.540 --> 29:25.740
 This country, you'd say mostly,

29:25.740 --> 29:28.220
 you'd certainly wanna make a lot of improvements.

29:28.220 --> 29:29.700
 And that's why I don't wanna press that

29:29.700 --> 29:31.660
 get rid of the constitution button,

29:31.660 --> 29:34.060
 but to just dump on the anarchists is to miss the point.

29:34.060 --> 29:36.540
 Always try to learn from any opinion.

29:37.500 --> 29:39.100
 What in it is true?

29:39.100 --> 29:42.900
 I'm just like marveling at the poetry

29:42.900 --> 29:45.580
 of saying that we should squish our anarchy

29:45.580 --> 29:48.380
 into the right corners of it.

29:48.380 --> 29:52.020
 Okay, I gotta ask, I've been talking with,

29:53.940 --> 29:55.940
 since we're doing a whirlwind introduction

29:55.940 --> 29:57.420
 to all of economics,

29:57.420 --> 30:00.100
 I've been talking to a few objectivists recently

30:00.100 --> 30:04.340
 and just, Ayn Rand comes up as a person,

30:04.340 --> 30:07.060
 as a philosopher throughout many conversations.

30:07.060 --> 30:09.180
 A lot of people really despise her.

30:09.180 --> 30:11.140
 A lot of people really love her.

30:11.140 --> 30:14.940
 It's always weird to me when somebody arouses a philosophy

30:14.940 --> 30:16.780
 or a human being arouses that much emotion

30:16.780 --> 30:20.140
 in either direction, does she make,

30:20.140 --> 30:22.780
 do you understand, first of all, that level of emotion

30:22.780 --> 30:25.060
 and what are your thoughts about Ayn Rand

30:25.060 --> 30:26.700
 and her philosophy of objectivism?

30:26.700 --> 30:31.140
 Is it useful at all to think about this kind of formulation

30:31.140 --> 30:34.860
 of a rational self interest,

30:34.860 --> 30:36.700
 if I could put it in those words,

30:36.700 --> 30:41.700
 or I guess more negatively the selfishness

30:43.100 --> 30:46.540
 or she would put, I guess, the virtue of selfishness.

30:46.540 --> 30:49.300
 Ayn Rand was a big influence on me growing up.

30:49.300 --> 30:50.860
 The book that really mattered for me was

30:50.860 --> 30:53.340
 Capitalism, The Unknown Ideal.

30:53.340 --> 30:56.220
 The notion that wealth creates opportunity

30:56.220 --> 30:59.860
 and good lives and wealth is something we ought to valorize

30:59.860 --> 31:01.340
 and give very high status.

31:01.340 --> 31:02.860
 It's one of her key ideas.

31:02.860 --> 31:04.500
 I think it's completely correct.

31:04.500 --> 31:06.100
 I think she has the most profound

31:06.100 --> 31:08.780
 and articulate statement of that idea.

31:08.780 --> 31:10.780
 That said, as a philosopher,

31:10.780 --> 31:12.980
 I disagree with her on most things.

31:12.980 --> 31:15.700
 And I did, even like as a boy, when I was reading her,

31:15.700 --> 31:17.820
 I read Plato before Ayn Rand.

31:17.820 --> 31:19.140
 And in a Socratic dialogue,

31:19.140 --> 31:20.380
 there's all these different points of view

31:20.380 --> 31:22.100
 being thrown around.

31:22.100 --> 31:24.100
 And whomever it is you agree with,

31:24.100 --> 31:27.020
 you understand the wisdom is in the coming together

31:27.020 --> 31:28.700
 of the different points of view.

31:28.700 --> 31:29.780
 And she doesn't have that.

31:29.780 --> 31:32.980
 So altruism can be wonderful in my view.

31:32.980 --> 31:35.340
 Humans are not actually that rational.

31:35.340 --> 31:38.140
 Self interest is often poorly defined.

31:38.140 --> 31:41.140
 To pound the table and say existence exists.

31:41.140 --> 31:42.900
 I wouldn't say I disagree,

31:42.900 --> 31:46.460
 but I'm not sure that it's a very meaningful statement.

31:46.460 --> 31:49.220
 I think the secret to Ayn Rand is that she was Russian.

31:49.220 --> 31:52.020
 I'd love to have her on my podcast if she was still alive.

31:52.020 --> 31:53.820
 I'd only ask her about Russia,

31:53.820 --> 31:56.060
 which she mostly never talked about

31:56.060 --> 31:57.860
 after writing We the Living.

31:57.860 --> 32:01.580
 And she is much more Russian than she seems at first,

32:01.580 --> 32:04.340
 even like purging people from the objectivist circles.

32:04.340 --> 32:07.380
 It's like how Russians, especially female Russians,

32:07.380 --> 32:09.300
 so often purge their friends.

32:09.300 --> 32:11.540
 It's weird, all the parallels.

32:11.540 --> 32:13.460
 So you're saying, so yes,

32:13.460 --> 32:17.740
 so assuming she's still not around,

32:17.740 --> 32:20.580
 but if she is and she comes onto your podcast,

32:20.580 --> 32:21.940
 can you dig into that a little bit?

32:21.940 --> 32:26.020
 Do you mean like her personal demons

32:26.020 --> 32:31.020
 around the social and economic Russia of the time,

32:31.940 --> 32:32.860
 when she escaped?

32:32.860 --> 32:34.820
 The traumas she suffered there,

32:34.820 --> 32:37.540
 what she really likes in the music and literature and why.

32:37.540 --> 32:38.580
 Music and literature, huh?

32:38.580 --> 32:40.220
 And getting deeply into that,

32:40.220 --> 32:42.860
 her view of relations between the sexes and Russia,

32:42.860 --> 32:44.980
 how it differs from America,

32:44.980 --> 32:48.260
 why she still carries through the old Russian vision

32:48.260 --> 32:51.500
 in her fiction, this extreme sexual dimorphism,

32:51.500 --> 32:53.860
 but with also very strong women,

32:53.860 --> 32:57.860
 to me is a uniquely, at least Eastern European vision,

32:57.860 --> 32:59.380
 mostly Russian, I would say.

33:00.380 --> 33:03.140
 And that's in her, that's her actual real philosophy,

33:03.140 --> 33:06.060
 not this table bounding existence exists.

33:06.060 --> 33:07.820
 And that's not talked about enough.

33:07.820 --> 33:09.260
 She's a Russian philosopher.

33:09.260 --> 33:12.380
 Or Soviet, whatever you wanna call it.

33:12.380 --> 33:14.700
 And if she wasn't so certain,

33:14.700 --> 33:17.340
 she could have been a Dostoevsky where it's not,

33:17.340 --> 33:19.060
 that certainty is almost the thing

33:19.060 --> 33:23.340
 that brings out the adoration of millions,

33:23.340 --> 33:25.260
 but also the hatred of millions.

33:25.260 --> 33:29.020
 She became a cult figure in a somewhat Russian like manner.

33:29.020 --> 33:29.980
 Yeah.

33:29.980 --> 33:30.820
 Yeah.

33:30.820 --> 33:32.140
 It is what it is.

33:32.140 --> 33:34.580
 But I love the idea that, again,

33:34.580 --> 33:37.100
 you're just dropping bombs that are poetic,

33:37.100 --> 33:40.940
 that the wisdom is in the coming together of ideas.

33:40.940 --> 33:42.300
 It's kind of interesting to think

33:42.300 --> 33:46.780
 that no one human possesses wisdom.

33:46.780 --> 33:49.380
 No one idea is the wisdom.

33:49.380 --> 33:52.180
 That the coming together is the wisdom.

33:52.180 --> 33:54.620
 Like in my view, Boswell's Life of Johnson,

33:54.620 --> 33:56.900
 18th century British biography.

33:56.900 --> 33:59.900
 It's in essence a coauthored work, Boswell and Johnson.

33:59.900 --> 34:02.660
 It's one of the greatest philosophy books ever,

34:02.660 --> 34:05.180
 though it is commonly regarded as a biography.

34:05.180 --> 34:07.180
 John Stuart Mill, who in a sense

34:07.180 --> 34:09.140
 was coauthoring with Harriet Taylor,

34:10.140 --> 34:12.060
 better philosopher than is realized,

34:12.060 --> 34:14.140
 though he's rated very, very highly.

34:14.140 --> 34:18.020
 Plato slash Socrates, a lot of the greatest works

34:18.020 --> 34:19.860
 are in a kind of dialogue form.

34:19.860 --> 34:23.060
 Curtis Faust would be another example.

34:23.060 --> 34:24.940
 It's very much a dialogue.

34:24.940 --> 34:27.340
 And yes, it's drama, but it's also a philosophy.

34:27.340 --> 34:30.380
 Shakespeare, maybe the wisest thinker of them all.

34:31.900 --> 34:35.380
 In your book, Big Business, speaking of Ayn Rand,

34:35.380 --> 34:38.860
 Big Business, A Love Letter to an American Antihero,

34:38.860 --> 34:41.460
 you make the case for the benefit

34:41.460 --> 34:43.500
 that large businesses bring to society.

34:43.500 --> 34:45.140
 Can you explain?

34:45.140 --> 34:46.900
 If you look at, say, the pandemic,

34:46.900 --> 34:49.060
 which has been a catastrophic event, right,

34:49.060 --> 34:52.620
 for many reasons, but who is it that saved us?

34:52.620 --> 34:56.180
 So Amazon has done remarkably well.

34:56.180 --> 34:59.420
 They upped their delivery game more or less overnight

34:59.420 --> 35:00.980
 with very few hitches.

35:00.980 --> 35:03.660
 I've ordered hundreds of Amazon packages,

35:03.660 --> 35:07.380
 direct delivery food, whether it's DoorDash or Uber Eats,

35:07.380 --> 35:10.100
 or using Whole Foods through Amazon shipping.

35:10.100 --> 35:12.260
 Again, it's gone remarkably well.

35:12.260 --> 35:15.780
 Switching over our entire higher educational system,

35:15.780 --> 35:18.140
 basically within two weeks, to Zoom.

35:18.140 --> 35:19.100
 Zoom did it.

35:19.100 --> 35:21.260
 I mean, I've had a Zoom outage,

35:21.260 --> 35:24.820
 but their performance rate has been remarkably high.

35:24.820 --> 35:29.420
 So if you just look at resources, competence, incentives,

35:29.420 --> 35:31.900
 who's been the star performers, the NBA even,

35:31.900 --> 35:34.460
 just canceling the season as early as they did,

35:34.460 --> 35:37.580
 sending a message like, hey, people, this is real,

35:37.580 --> 35:39.580
 and then pulling off the bubble

35:39.580 --> 35:41.700
 with not a single found case of COVID

35:41.700 --> 35:45.060
 and having all the testing set up in advance.

35:45.060 --> 35:47.820
 Big business has done very well lately,

35:47.820 --> 35:50.700
 and throughout the broader course of American history,

35:50.700 --> 35:52.700
 in my view, has mostly been a hero.

35:53.900 --> 35:56.220
 Can we engage in a kind of therapy session?

35:58.540 --> 36:03.540
 I'm often troubled by the negativity towards big business,

36:04.180 --> 36:07.260
 and I wonder if you could help figure out

36:07.260 --> 36:11.380
 how we remove that or maybe first psychoanalyze it

36:11.380 --> 36:12.980
 and then how we remove it.

36:12.980 --> 36:17.980
 It feels like once we've gotten wifi on flights,

36:20.620 --> 36:24.860
 on airplane flights, people started complaining

36:24.860 --> 36:27.180
 about how shady the connection is, right?

36:27.180 --> 36:29.540
 They take it for granted immediately

36:29.540 --> 36:31.900
 and then start complaining about little details.

36:31.900 --> 36:36.380
 Another example that's closer to,

36:36.380 --> 36:39.740
 especially as an aspiring entrepreneur,

36:39.740 --> 36:41.980
 is closer to the things I'm thinking about

36:41.980 --> 36:44.060
 is Jack Dorsey with Twitter.

36:45.260 --> 36:46.940
 To me, Twitter has enabled

36:46.940 --> 36:50.620
 an incredible platform of communication,

36:50.620 --> 36:53.420
 and yet the biggest thing that people talk about

36:53.420 --> 36:57.380
 is not how incredible this platform is.

36:58.460 --> 37:00.660
 They essentially use the platform

37:00.660 --> 37:03.700
 to complain about the censorship of a few individuals

37:04.620 --> 37:06.260
 as opposed to how amazing it is.

37:06.260 --> 37:09.420
 Now, you should talk about how shady the wifi is

37:09.420 --> 37:12.460
 and how censorship or the removal of Donald Trump

37:12.460 --> 37:13.820
 from the platform is a bad thing,

37:13.820 --> 37:17.740
 but it feels like we don't talk about the positive impacts

37:17.740 --> 37:20.420
 at scale of these technologies.

37:20.420 --> 37:23.940
 Can you explain why and is there a way to fix it?

37:23.940 --> 37:25.340
 I don't know if we can fix it.

37:25.340 --> 37:29.300
 I think we are beings of high neuroticism for the most part

37:29.300 --> 37:30.740
 as a personality trait.

37:30.740 --> 37:33.460
 Not everyone, but most people.

37:33.460 --> 37:34.780
 And as a compliment to that,

37:34.780 --> 37:38.140
 if someone says 10 nice things about you and one insult,

37:38.140 --> 37:39.540
 you're more bothered by the insult

37:39.540 --> 37:41.140
 than you're pleased by the nice things,

37:41.140 --> 37:43.820
 especially if the insult is somewhat true.

37:43.820 --> 37:46.620
 So you have these media, these vehicles,

37:46.620 --> 37:48.420
 Twitter is one you mentioned,

37:48.420 --> 37:50.580
 where there's all kinds of messages going back and forth,

37:50.580 --> 37:53.580
 and you're really bugged by the messages you don't like.

37:53.580 --> 37:56.180
 Most people are neurotic to begin with.

37:56.180 --> 37:58.820
 It's not only taken out on big business, to be clear.

37:58.820 --> 38:01.580
 So Congress catches a lot of grief

38:01.580 --> 38:03.940
 and some of it they deserve, yes.

38:05.260 --> 38:07.380
 Religion is not attacked the same way,

38:07.380 --> 38:09.820
 but religiosity is declining.

38:09.820 --> 38:14.580
 If you poll people, the military still polls quite well,

38:14.580 --> 38:17.020
 but people are very disillusioned with many things.

38:17.020 --> 38:19.740
 And the Martin Gury thesis that because of the internet,

38:19.740 --> 38:21.580
 you just see more of things.

38:21.580 --> 38:22.860
 And the more you see of something,

38:22.860 --> 38:24.940
 whether it's good, bad, or in between,

38:24.940 --> 38:26.740
 the more you will find to complain about,

38:26.740 --> 38:28.940
 I suspect is the fundamental mechanism here.

38:30.460 --> 38:32.660
 I mean, look at Clubhouse, right?

38:32.660 --> 38:35.780
 To me, it's a great service, may or may not be like my thing,

38:35.780 --> 38:37.380
 but gives people this opportunity.

38:37.380 --> 38:39.100
 No one makes you go on it.

38:39.100 --> 38:40.620
 And all these media articles like,

38:40.620 --> 38:42.740
 oh, is Clubhouse gonna wreck things?

38:42.740 --> 38:44.260
 Are they gonna break things?

38:44.260 --> 38:45.740
 New York Times is complaining.

38:45.740 --> 38:48.020
 Of course, it's their competitor as well.

38:48.020 --> 38:50.820
 I'm like, give these people a chance, talk it up.

38:50.820 --> 38:52.700
 You may or may not like it.

38:52.700 --> 38:55.580
 Let's praise the people who are getting something done.

38:55.580 --> 38:57.780
 Very Ayn Randian point.

38:57.780 --> 39:01.460
 As an economic thinker, as a writer, as a podcaster,

39:01.460 --> 39:03.980
 what do you think about Clubhouse?

39:03.980 --> 39:06.300
 What do you think about...

39:06.300 --> 39:09.780
 Okay, let me just throw my feeling about it.

39:09.780 --> 39:12.380
 I used to use Discord, which is another service

39:12.380 --> 39:13.620
 where people use voice.

39:13.620 --> 39:16.420
 So the only thing you do is just hear each other.

39:16.420 --> 39:19.060
 There's no face, you just see a little icon.

39:19.060 --> 39:23.700
 That's the essential element of Clubhouse.

39:23.700 --> 39:26.540
 And there's an intimacy to voice only communication.

39:26.540 --> 39:27.660
 That's hard.

39:27.660 --> 39:30.860
 That didn't make sense to me, but it was just what it is,

39:30.860 --> 39:33.420
 which feels like something that won't last

39:33.420 --> 39:36.260
 for some reason, maybe it's the cynical view.

39:36.260 --> 39:40.900
 But what's your sense about the intimacy

39:40.900 --> 39:43.420
 of what's happening right now with Clubhouse?

39:43.420 --> 39:45.580
 I've greatly enjoyed what I've done,

39:45.580 --> 39:47.380
 but I'm not sure it's for me in the long run

39:47.380 --> 39:48.740
 for two reasons.

39:48.740 --> 39:52.500
 First, if you compare it to doing a podcast,

39:52.500 --> 39:55.220
 podcasting has greater reach than Clubhouse.

39:55.220 --> 39:58.340
 So I would rather put time into my podcast.

39:58.340 --> 40:02.820
 But then also my core asset, so to speak,

40:02.820 --> 40:04.980
 is I'm a very fast reader.

40:04.980 --> 40:08.220
 So audio per se is not necessarily to my advantage.

40:08.220 --> 40:10.860
 I don't speak or listen faster than other people.

40:10.860 --> 40:13.620
 In fact, I'm a slower listener because I like 1.0,

40:13.620 --> 40:15.500
 not 1.5X.

40:15.500 --> 40:17.260
 So I should spend less time on audio

40:17.260 --> 40:18.820
 and more time reading and writing.

40:18.820 --> 40:21.860
 Yeah, it's interesting because you mentioned podcasts

40:21.860 --> 40:26.860
 and audio books, the podcasts are recorded

40:28.660 --> 40:32.100
 and so I can skip things, like I can skip commercials,

40:32.100 --> 40:34.060
 or I can skip parts where it's like,

40:34.060 --> 40:36.220
 ugh, this part is boring.

40:36.220 --> 40:40.140
 With live conversations, especially when,

40:40.140 --> 40:42.540
 there's a magic to the fact when you have a lot of people

40:42.540 --> 40:44.820
 participating in that conversation,

40:44.820 --> 40:47.980
 but some people are like, ugh, this topic,

40:47.980 --> 40:50.100
 they're going into this thing and you can't skip it

40:50.100 --> 40:53.980
 or you can't fast forward, you can go 1.5X or 2X,

40:53.980 --> 40:55.140
 you can't speed it up.

40:56.100 --> 40:58.540
 Nevertheless, there's a tension between that,

40:58.540 --> 41:00.540
 so that's the productivity aspect,

41:00.540 --> 41:04.620
 with the actual magic of live communication,

41:04.620 --> 41:07.420
 where anything can happen, where Elon Musk

41:07.420 --> 41:11.340
 can ask the CEO of Robinhood, Vlad, about like,

41:11.340 --> 41:13.300
 hey, somebody holding a gun to your head,

41:13.300 --> 41:16.100
 there's something shady going on, the magic of that.

41:16.100 --> 41:18.300
 That's also my criticism of like,

41:18.300 --> 41:20.900
 there's been a recent conversation with Bill Gates

41:20.900 --> 41:25.900
 that he won a platform and had a regular interview

41:26.700 --> 41:29.540
 on the platform without allowing the possibility

41:29.540 --> 41:31.380
 of the magic of the chaos.

41:32.460 --> 41:36.180
 So I'm not exactly sure, it's probably not the right

41:36.180 --> 41:38.380
 platform for you and for many other people

41:38.380 --> 41:40.860
 who are exceptionally productive in other places,

41:40.860 --> 41:43.420
 but there's still nevertheless a magic to the chaos

41:43.420 --> 41:45.540
 that can be created with live conversation

41:45.540 --> 41:47.860
 that gives me pause.

41:47.860 --> 41:50.140
 Maybe what it's perfect for is the tribute.

41:50.140 --> 41:52.520
 So they had an episode recently that I didn't hear,

41:52.520 --> 41:54.040
 but I heard it was wonderful.

41:54.040 --> 41:56.380
 It was anecdotes about Steve Jobs.

41:56.380 --> 41:58.040
 That you can't do one to one, right?

41:58.040 --> 41:59.460
 And you don't want control.

41:59.460 --> 42:02.020
 You want different people appearing and stepping up

42:02.020 --> 42:03.780
 and saying their bit.

42:03.780 --> 42:07.740
 And Clubhouse is 110% perfect for that.

42:07.740 --> 42:08.900
 The tribute.

42:08.900 --> 42:10.500
 I love that, the tribute.

42:10.500 --> 42:12.580
 But there's also the possibility,

42:12.580 --> 42:15.740
 I think there was a time when somebody arranged

42:15.740 --> 42:18.900
 a conversation with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates on stage.

42:18.900 --> 42:21.000
 I remember that happened a long time ago.

42:22.540 --> 42:24.560
 And it was very formal.

42:26.580 --> 42:27.900
 It could have probably gone better,

42:27.900 --> 42:30.060
 but it was still magical to have these people

42:30.060 --> 42:32.220
 that obviously had a bunch of tension

42:32.220 --> 42:33.420
 throughout their history.

42:35.420 --> 42:39.460
 It's so frictionless to have two major figures

42:39.460 --> 42:42.580
 in world history just jump on a Clubhouse stage.

42:42.580 --> 42:43.780
 Putin and Elon Musk.

42:43.780 --> 42:45.660
 Putin and Elon Musk.

42:45.660 --> 42:47.180
 And that's exactly it.

42:47.180 --> 42:48.820
 So there's a language barrier there.

42:48.820 --> 42:52.860
 There's also the problem that in particular,

42:52.860 --> 42:55.900
 it's like Biden would have a similar problem.

42:55.900 --> 42:58.340
 It's like they're just not into a new technology.

42:58.340 --> 43:01.580
 So it's very hard to catch the Kremlin up to,

43:01.580 --> 43:02.860
 first of all, Twitter,

43:03.740 --> 43:05.160
 but to catch them up to Clubhouse,

43:05.160 --> 43:07.260
 you have to have the,

43:07.260 --> 43:08.820
 Elon Musk has a sense of the internet,

43:08.820 --> 43:10.860
 the humor, the memes, and all that kind of stuff

43:10.860 --> 43:14.900
 that you have to have in order to use a new app

43:14.900 --> 43:16.900
 and figure out the timing, the beat,

43:16.900 --> 43:18.280
 what is this thing about?

43:19.140 --> 43:20.540
 So that's the challenge there.

43:20.540 --> 43:21.620
 But that's exactly it.

43:21.620 --> 43:26.620
 That magic of have two big personalities just show up.

43:27.900 --> 43:30.660
 And I wonder if it's just the temporary thing

43:30.660 --> 43:32.340
 that we're going through with the pandemic

43:32.340 --> 43:34.660
 where people are just lonely

43:35.620 --> 43:37.500
 and they're seeking for that human connection

43:37.500 --> 43:40.540
 that we usually get elsewhere through our work.

43:40.540 --> 43:42.620
 But they'll stay lonely, in my opinion.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.560
 You think so? I do.

43:44.560 --> 43:48.140
 So it is a pandemic thing, but I think it will persist.

43:48.140 --> 43:49.900
 And the idea of wanting to be connected

43:49.900 --> 43:53.500
 to more of the world, Clubhouse will still offer that.

43:53.500 --> 43:56.140
 And all the mental health issues out there,

43:56.140 --> 43:58.700
 a lot of people have broken ties

43:58.700 --> 44:00.900
 and they will still be lonely post vaccines.

44:02.300 --> 44:05.600
 Yeah, I, from an artificial intelligence perspective,

44:06.940 --> 44:10.720
 have a sense that there is like a deep loneliness

44:10.720 --> 44:13.140
 in the world, that all of us are really lonely.

44:13.140 --> 44:14.460
 Like we don't even acknowledge it.

44:14.460 --> 44:16.660
 Even people in happy relationships,

44:16.660 --> 44:19.140
 it feels like there's like an iceberg of loneliness

44:19.140 --> 44:22.700
 in all of us, like seeking to be understood,

44:22.700 --> 44:24.980
 like deeply understood, understanding us,

44:24.980 --> 44:27.860
 like having somebody with whom you can have

44:27.860 --> 44:31.540
 a deep interaction enough to where you can,

44:31.540 --> 44:34.100
 they can help you to understand yourself

44:34.100 --> 44:36.460
 and they also understand you.

44:36.460 --> 44:38.820
 Like I have a sense that artificial intelligence systems

44:38.820 --> 44:42.100
 can provide that as well, but humans,

44:42.100 --> 44:44.420
 I think crave that from other humans

44:44.420 --> 44:46.460
 in ways that we perhaps don't acknowledge.

44:46.460 --> 44:48.980
 And I have a hope that technology will enable that

44:48.980 --> 44:50.900
 more and more, like Clubhouse is an example

44:50.900 --> 44:52.260
 that allows that.

44:52.260 --> 44:54.940
 Are touring bots gonna out compete Clubhouse?

44:54.940 --> 44:57.560
 Like why not sort of program your own session?

44:57.560 --> 44:59.900
 You'll just talk into your device

44:59.900 --> 45:02.300
 and say here's the kind of conversation I want

45:02.300 --> 45:04.580
 and it will create the characters for you.

45:04.580 --> 45:07.080
 And it may not be as good as Elon and Vladimir Putin,

45:07.080 --> 45:09.620
 but it will be better than ordinary Clubhouse.

45:09.620 --> 45:11.680
 Yeah, and one of the things that's missing,

45:11.680 --> 45:14.940
 it's not just conversation, it's memory.

45:14.940 --> 45:19.100
 So longterm memories, what current AI systems don't have

45:19.100 --> 45:21.200
 is sharing experience together.

45:21.200 --> 45:24.020
 Forget the words, it's like sharing the highs

45:24.020 --> 45:26.300
 and the lows of life together

45:26.300 --> 45:29.460
 and the systems around us remembering that.

45:29.460 --> 45:31.300
 Remembering we've been through that.

45:31.300 --> 45:32.900
 Like that's the thing that creates

45:32.900 --> 45:35.460
 really close relationships, is going through some shit.

45:35.460 --> 45:37.660
 Like struggle.

45:37.660 --> 45:41.020
 If you survive together, there's something really difficult

45:41.020 --> 45:42.820
 that bonds you with other humans.

45:42.820 --> 45:46.500
 And this is related to immigration and the American dream.

45:46.500 --> 45:47.340
 In what way?

45:47.340 --> 45:48.940
 The people who have come to this country,

45:48.940 --> 45:51.860
 however weird and different they may be,

45:51.860 --> 45:53.740
 they or their ancestors at some point

45:53.740 --> 45:55.300
 probably have shared this thing.

45:58.140 --> 46:00.100
 Right, US is not gonna split up.

46:00.100 --> 46:02.380
 It may get more screwed up as a country,

46:02.380 --> 46:05.500
 but Texas and California are not gonna break off.

46:05.500 --> 46:07.280
 I mean, they're big enough where they could do it,

46:07.280 --> 46:08.920
 but it's just never gonna happen.

46:08.920 --> 46:10.380
 We've been through too much together.

46:10.380 --> 46:11.220
 Yeah.

46:11.220 --> 46:14.060
 Yeah, that's a hopeful message.

46:14.060 --> 46:17.020
 Do you think, some people have talked to Eric Weinstein,

46:17.020 --> 46:18.620
 you've talked to Eric Weinstein.

46:20.060 --> 46:21.700
 He has a sense that growth,

46:23.460 --> 46:26.200
 like the entirety of the American system

46:26.200 --> 46:28.820
 is based on the assumption that we're gonna grow forever,

46:28.820 --> 46:30.980
 that the economy's gonna grow forever.

46:30.980 --> 46:35.780
 Do you think economic growth will continue indefinitely?

46:35.780 --> 46:37.180
 Or will we stagnate?

46:37.180 --> 46:40.940
 I've long been in agreement with Eric, Peter Thiel,

46:40.940 --> 46:45.300
 Robert Gordon and others, that growth has slowed down.

46:45.300 --> 46:46.540
 I argued that in my book,

46:46.540 --> 46:49.620
 The Great Stagnation, appropriately titled.

46:49.620 --> 46:52.180
 But the last two years, I've become much more optimistic.

46:52.180 --> 46:53.900
 I've seen a lot of breakthroughs

46:53.900 --> 46:56.780
 in green energy and battery technology.

46:56.780 --> 47:00.860
 mRNA vaccines and medicine is a big deal already.

47:00.860 --> 47:02.380
 It will repair our GDP

47:02.380 --> 47:05.180
 and save millions of lives around the world.

47:05.180 --> 47:07.100
 There's an anti malaria vaccine

47:07.100 --> 47:10.100
 that's now in stage three trial, it probably works.

47:10.100 --> 47:12.380
 CRISPR to defeat sickle cell anemia.

47:13.660 --> 47:16.540
 Just space, area after area after area,

47:16.540 --> 47:18.780
 there's suddenly the surge of breakthroughs.

47:18.780 --> 47:22.060
 I would say many of them rooted in superior computation

47:22.060 --> 47:23.500
 and ultimately Moore's law

47:23.500 --> 47:26.580
 and access to those computational abilities.

47:26.580 --> 47:28.460
 So I'm much more optimistic than say,

47:28.460 --> 47:30.420
 the last time I spoke to Eric.

47:30.420 --> 47:32.900
 I don't know, he moves all the time in his views.

47:32.900 --> 47:34.220
 I don't know where he's going.

47:34.220 --> 47:35.940
 His views, I don't know where he's at now.

47:35.940 --> 47:38.900
 He's not at, he hasn't gained, that's really interesting.

47:38.900 --> 47:43.900
 So your little drop of optimism comes from like,

47:44.180 --> 47:46.180
 there might be a fundamental shift

47:46.180 --> 47:49.620
 in the kind of things that computation has unlocked for us

47:49.620 --> 47:52.860
 in terms of like, it could be a wellspring of innovation

47:52.860 --> 47:55.540
 that enables growth for a long time to come.

47:55.540 --> 47:59.420
 Like Eric has not quite connected

47:59.420 --> 48:01.620
 to the computation aspect yet

48:01.620 --> 48:04.340
 to where it could be a wellspring of innovation.

48:04.340 --> 48:06.180
 But you're very close to it in your own work.

48:06.180 --> 48:07.740
 I don't have to tell you that.

48:07.740 --> 48:10.020
 The work you're doing would not have been possible

48:10.020 --> 48:11.300
 not very long ago.

48:11.300 --> 48:12.140
 But the question is,

48:12.140 --> 48:14.820
 how much does that work enable continued growth

48:14.820 --> 48:16.180
 for decades to come?

48:16.180 --> 48:17.660
 For all their problems,

48:17.660 --> 48:20.700
 some version of driverless vehicles will be a thing.

48:20.700 --> 48:23.380
 I'm not sure when, you know much better than I do.

48:23.380 --> 48:26.700
 Maybe only partially, but that too will be a big deal.

48:26.700 --> 48:28.220
 Well, one of the open questions

48:28.220 --> 48:32.940
 that sort of the Peter Thiel School area of ideas

48:32.940 --> 48:36.180
 is how much can be converted to technology?

48:36.180 --> 48:38.740
 How much, how many parts of our lives

48:38.740 --> 48:40.740
 can technology integrate and then innovate?

48:40.740 --> 48:43.460
 Like can it replace healthcare?

48:43.460 --> 48:46.420
 Can it replace the legal system?

48:46.420 --> 48:47.740
 Can it replace government?

48:47.740 --> 48:52.740
 Not replace, but like, you know, make it digital

48:52.740 --> 48:57.460
 and thereby enable computation to improve it, right?

48:57.460 --> 48:58.820
 That's the open question,

48:58.820 --> 49:00.740
 because many aspects of our lives

49:00.740 --> 49:04.980
 are still not really that digitized.

49:06.020 --> 49:08.580
 There was a New York Times symposium in April,

49:08.580 --> 49:09.740
 which is not long ago.

49:09.740 --> 49:11.940
 And they asked the so called experts,

49:11.940 --> 49:13.620
 when are we gonna get vaccines?

49:13.620 --> 49:17.700
 And the most optimistic answer was in four years.

49:17.700 --> 49:21.260
 And obviously we beat that by a long mile.

49:21.260 --> 49:23.140
 So I think people still haven't woken up.

49:23.140 --> 49:25.020
 You mentioned my tiny drop of optimism,

49:25.020 --> 49:27.860
 but it's a big drop of optimism.

49:27.860 --> 49:28.940
 Is it a waterfall yet?

49:28.940 --> 49:30.740
 I mean, is it just?

49:30.740 --> 49:32.380
 Well, here's my pessimism.

49:32.380 --> 49:34.460
 Whenever there are major new technologies,

49:34.460 --> 49:36.340
 they also tend to be used for violence

49:36.340 --> 49:39.220
 directly or indirectly, radio, Hitler.

49:39.220 --> 49:41.100
 Not that he hit people over the head with radios,

49:41.100 --> 49:44.700
 but it enabled the rise of various dictators.

49:44.700 --> 49:48.620
 So the new technologies now, whatever exactly they may be,

49:48.620 --> 49:50.500
 they're gonna cause a lot of trouble.

49:50.500 --> 49:51.660
 And that's my pessimism.

49:51.660 --> 49:54.740
 Not that I think they're all gonna slow to a trickle.

49:54.740 --> 49:56.660
 When was the stagnation book?

49:56.660 --> 49:57.860
 2011.

49:57.860 --> 49:58.740
 2011.

49:58.740 --> 49:59.900
 Yes.

49:59.900 --> 50:03.060
 It was the first of the stagnation books, in fact.

50:03.060 --> 50:05.220
 It's very interesting.

50:05.220 --> 50:07.700
 But even then I said, this is temporary.

50:07.700 --> 50:09.620
 And I was predicting it would be gone

50:09.620 --> 50:11.220
 in about 20 years time.

50:12.460 --> 50:14.540
 I'm not sure that's exactly the right prediction,

50:14.540 --> 50:17.840
 like 2030, but I think we're actually gonna beat that.

50:19.140 --> 50:21.020
 So you think United States might still be

50:21.020 --> 50:22.980
 on top of the world for the rest of the century

50:22.980 --> 50:26.260
 in terms of its economic growth,

50:26.260 --> 50:28.460
 impact on the world, scientific innovation,

50:28.460 --> 50:29.940
 all those kinds of things?

50:29.940 --> 50:31.460
 That's too long to predict,

50:31.460 --> 50:33.420
 but I'm bullish on America in general.

50:35.060 --> 50:36.740
 Got it.

50:36.740 --> 50:38.900
 Speaking of being bullish on America,

50:38.900 --> 50:40.820
 the opposite of that is,

50:43.420 --> 50:44.420
 we talked about capitalism,

50:44.420 --> 50:47.060
 we talked about Iran and her Russian roots.

50:47.900 --> 50:51.340
 What do you think about communism?

50:51.340 --> 50:53.240
 Why doesn't it work?

50:53.240 --> 50:58.180
 Is it the implementation?

50:58.180 --> 51:01.540
 Is there anything about its ideas that you find compelling?

51:01.540 --> 51:06.220
 Or is it just a fundamentally flawed system?

51:06.220 --> 51:08.020
 Well, communism is like capitalism.

51:08.020 --> 51:10.740
 The words mean many things to different people.

51:10.740 --> 51:12.860
 You could argue my life as a tenured professor

51:12.860 --> 51:15.300
 comes closer to communism than anything

51:15.300 --> 51:16.460
 the human race has seen.

51:16.460 --> 51:19.220
 And I would argue it works pretty well.

51:19.220 --> 51:21.740
 But look, if you mean the Soviet Union,

51:21.740 --> 51:23.700
 it devolved pretty quickly

51:23.700 --> 51:27.500
 to a kind of decentralized set of incentives

51:27.500 --> 51:30.620
 that were destructive rather than value maximizing.

51:30.620 --> 51:34.300
 It wasn't even central planning, much less communism.

51:34.300 --> 51:37.140
 So Paul Craig Roberts and Polanyi were correct

51:37.140 --> 51:39.680
 in their descriptions of the Soviet system.

51:39.680 --> 51:41.580
 Think of it as weird mixes of barter

51:41.580 --> 51:44.100
 and malfunctioning incentives

51:44.100 --> 51:47.100
 and being very good at a whole bunch of things,

51:47.100 --> 51:48.860
 but in terms of progress, innovation,

51:48.860 --> 51:52.240
 and consumer goods, it really being quite a failure.

51:54.460 --> 51:56.380
 And now I wouldn't call that communism,

51:56.380 --> 52:00.420
 but that's what I think of the system the Soviets had.

52:00.420 --> 52:04.840
 And it required an ever increasing pile of lies

52:04.840 --> 52:07.740
 that both alienated people, but created an elite

52:07.740 --> 52:08.940
 that by the end of the thing

52:08.940 --> 52:12.300
 no longer believed in the system itself,

52:12.300 --> 52:15.400
 or even thought they were doing better by being crooks

52:15.400 --> 52:17.000
 than by just say moving to Switzerland

52:17.000 --> 52:18.740
 and being an upper middle class individual,

52:18.740 --> 52:20.740
 like you would have a higher standard of living

52:20.740 --> 52:23.060
 by Gorbachev's time, not Gorbachev,

52:23.060 --> 52:25.340
 but if you're a number 30 in the hierarchy,

52:25.340 --> 52:27.900
 you're better off as a middle class person in Switzerland.

52:27.900 --> 52:31.180
 And that, of course, did not prove sustainable.

52:31.180 --> 52:33.620
 And so it's, what is it, a momentum of bureaucracy

52:33.620 --> 52:34.940
 or something like that, it just builds up

52:34.940 --> 52:37.700
 where you lose control of the original vision,

52:37.700 --> 52:40.180
 and that naturally happens, it's just people.

52:40.180 --> 52:41.980
 And you can't use normal profit and loss

52:41.980 --> 52:44.420
 and price incentives, so you get all prices

52:44.420 --> 52:46.780
 or most prices set too low, right?

52:46.780 --> 52:49.580
 Shortages everywhere, people trade favors,

52:49.580 --> 52:52.100
 you have this culture of bartered bribes,

52:52.100 --> 52:55.380
 sexual favors or family friends,

52:55.380 --> 52:57.060
 and you get more and more of that,

52:57.060 --> 52:59.780
 and you over time lose more and more of the information

52:59.780 --> 53:03.180
 and the prices and quantities and practices

53:03.180 --> 53:06.220
 and norms you had, and that sort of slowly decays,

53:06.220 --> 53:09.300
 and then by the end no one is believing in it.

53:09.300 --> 53:12.220
 That would be my take, but again, you're the expert here.

53:12.220 --> 53:17.220
 The Russian scholar, well, I'm perhaps no more

53:17.620 --> 53:20.580
 an expert than Ayn Rand, it's more personal

53:20.580 --> 53:25.060
 than it is scholarly or historic.

53:25.060 --> 53:27.660
 So Stalin held power for 30 years,

53:29.060 --> 53:34.060
 Vladimir Putin has held power for 21 years,

53:34.340 --> 53:36.820
 where you could argue he took a little break.

53:36.820 --> 53:39.980
 But not much, he was still holding power, I think.

53:39.980 --> 53:44.900
 And it's still possible now with the new constitution

53:44.900 --> 53:47.500
 that he could hold power from longer than Stalin,

53:47.500 --> 53:48.860
 longer than 30 years.

53:48.860 --> 53:51.380
 What do you think about the man,

53:51.380 --> 53:53.500
 the state of affairs in Russia,

53:54.780 --> 53:57.900
 in general, the system they have there?

53:57.900 --> 53:59.260
 Is there something interesting to you

53:59.260 --> 54:02.300
 as an economist, as a human being, about Russia?

54:02.300 --> 54:03.420
 Everything is interesting.

54:03.420 --> 54:05.980
 I mean, here would be part of my take.

54:05.980 --> 54:10.980
 As you know, the Russian economy starting, what, 1999, 2000,

54:11.060 --> 54:14.180
 has really quite a few years of super excellent growth.

54:15.060 --> 54:17.140
 And Putin is still riding on that.

54:17.140 --> 54:20.580
 It more or less coincides with his rise

54:20.580 --> 54:24.220
 as the truly focal figure on the scene.

54:24.220 --> 54:26.460
 Since then, pretty recently, they've had a bunch of years

54:26.460 --> 54:31.460
 of negative four to 5% growth in a row, which is terrible.

54:31.580 --> 54:35.180
 The economy is way too dependent on fossil fuels,

54:35.180 --> 54:37.660
 but the structural problem is this.

54:37.660 --> 54:40.860
 You need a concordance across economic power,

54:40.860 --> 54:43.140
 social power, political power.

54:43.140 --> 54:45.500
 They don't have to be allocated identically,

54:45.500 --> 54:49.340
 but they have to be allocated consistently.

54:49.340 --> 54:51.100
 And the Russian system under Putin,

54:51.100 --> 54:55.100
 from almost the beginning, has never been able to have that,

54:55.100 --> 54:58.460
 that ultimately his incentives are to steer the system

54:58.460 --> 55:01.660
 where the economic power is in a small number of hands

55:01.660 --> 55:03.900
 in a non diversified way.

55:03.900 --> 55:06.540
 The system won't deliver sustainable gains

55:06.540 --> 55:11.140
 in living standards anymore ever the way it's set up now.

55:11.140 --> 55:13.140
 Though if fossil fuel prices go up,

55:13.140 --> 55:15.780
 they'll have some good years for sure.

55:15.780 --> 55:20.340
 And that is really quite structural, what has gone wrong.

55:20.340 --> 55:23.380
 And then on top of that, you can have an opinion of Putin,

55:23.380 --> 55:25.660
 but you've got to start with those structural problems.

55:25.660 --> 55:28.700
 And that's why it's just not going to work.

55:28.700 --> 55:30.780
 But he had all those good years in the beginning.

55:30.780 --> 55:33.420
 So the number of Russians, say, who live here

55:33.420 --> 55:36.540
 or in Russia, who love Putin and it's sincere,

55:36.540 --> 55:39.260
 they're not just afraid of being dragged away,

55:39.260 --> 55:41.460
 like that's a real phenomenon.

55:41.460 --> 55:45.220
 Yeah, I'm really torn on Putin's approval rating,

55:45.220 --> 55:49.020
 real approval rating seems to be very high.

55:49.020 --> 55:54.020
 And I'm torn in whether that has to do with the fact

55:54.020 --> 55:56.980
 that there is control of the press,

55:58.180 --> 56:01.020
 or if it's, which is the people I talked to

56:01.020 --> 56:04.940
 who are in Russia, family and so on, a genuine love

56:04.940 --> 56:07.860
 of Putin, appreciation of what Putin has done

56:07.860 --> 56:10.180
 and is going to do with Russia.

56:10.180 --> 56:11.620
 And a lot of that would go away

56:11.620 --> 56:13.140
 if the press were freer, I think.

56:13.140 --> 56:15.940
 Yes, well, Singapore realizes this,

56:15.940 --> 56:18.580
 anyone discussed by the press, no matter who they are,

56:18.580 --> 56:20.620
 people in Singapore have done a great job.

56:20.620 --> 56:22.180
 Yes.

56:22.180 --> 56:24.700
 But if you're discussed by the press, you don't look good.

56:24.700 --> 56:27.140
 Tech company executives are learning this, right?

56:27.140 --> 56:28.380
 It's just like a rule.

56:28.380 --> 56:32.220
 So in that sense, I think the rating is artificially high,

56:32.220 --> 56:36.060
 but I don't by any means think it's all insincere,

56:36.060 --> 56:39.460
 but that high popularity I view as bearish for Russia.

56:39.460 --> 56:40.900
 I would feel better about the country

56:40.900 --> 56:43.060
 if people were more pissed off at him.

56:43.060 --> 56:44.180
 Yeah, that's right.

56:44.180 --> 56:47.260
 It's nice to see free speech, even if it's full of hate.

56:49.620 --> 56:52.860
 I am also troubled on the scientific side

56:52.860 --> 56:55.420
 and entrepreneurial side, it seems difficult

56:55.420 --> 56:58.500
 to be an entrepreneur in Russia.

56:58.500 --> 57:03.060
 Like it's not even in terms of rules,

57:03.060 --> 57:06.180
 it's just culturally, the people I speak to,

57:06.180 --> 57:11.180
 it's not easy to build a business, no.

57:11.580 --> 57:15.740
 It's not easy to even dream of building a business in Russia.

57:15.740 --> 57:17.140
 That's just not part of the culture,

57:17.140 --> 57:19.020
 part of the conversation.

57:19.020 --> 57:21.700
 It's almost like the conversation is,

57:21.700 --> 57:25.220
 if you wanna be the next Bill Gates or Elon Musk,

57:25.220 --> 57:28.820
 or Steve Jobs or whatever, you come to America.

57:28.820 --> 57:29.980
 That's the sense they have.

57:29.980 --> 57:32.460
 Yeah, history matters.

57:34.140 --> 57:37.340
 Is it history, is it structural problems of today?

57:37.340 --> 57:38.460
 It's all the same thing.

57:38.460 --> 57:40.620
 So a history of hostility to commerce,

57:40.620 --> 57:44.140
 which of course the old USSR is gone,

57:45.300 --> 57:47.220
 but a lot of the attitudes remain,

57:47.220 --> 57:49.140
 a lot of the corruption remains.

57:49.140 --> 57:51.020
 You have this legacy distribution of wealth

57:51.020 --> 57:53.220
 from the auctioning off of the assets,

57:53.220 --> 57:56.460
 which is not conducive to some kind of broadly egalitarian

57:56.460 --> 57:59.340
 democracy, and so you have these small number

57:59.340 --> 58:03.100
 of power points that try to control information and wealth

58:03.100 --> 58:06.180
 and not really so keen to encourage the others

58:06.180 --> 58:08.900
 who ultimately would pull the balance of political power

58:08.900 --> 58:11.620
 away from the very wealthy and from Putin,

58:11.620 --> 58:13.380
 and they support that culture,

58:13.380 --> 58:16.300
 and the return of interest in Orthodox Church and all that,

58:16.300 --> 58:19.300
 it's all part of the same piece, I think,

58:19.300 --> 58:22.140
 because the old Orthodox Church is not that pro commerce,

58:22.140 --> 58:24.220
 you'd have to say, but it's traditionalist,

58:24.220 --> 58:27.380
 it's pro family, those are safer ideas,

58:27.380 --> 58:29.420
 and then there's such a great safety valve,

58:29.420 --> 58:31.420
 the most ambitious, smartest people,

58:31.420 --> 58:33.660
 like they probably will learn English,

58:33.660 --> 58:35.820
 they sort of can look like they belong

58:35.820 --> 58:37.140
 in all sorts of other countries,

58:37.140 --> 58:39.700
 they can show up and blend in, super talented,

58:39.700 --> 58:42.300
 they've probably had an excellent education,

58:42.300 --> 58:44.460
 especially if they're from one of the two major cities,

58:44.460 --> 58:47.260
 but even if not so, even from Siberia,

58:47.260 --> 58:49.180
 and they go off, they leave,

58:49.180 --> 58:51.220
 they're not a source of opposition,

58:51.220 --> 58:52.780
 and that keeps the whole thing up and running

58:52.780 --> 58:54.740
 for another generation.

58:54.740 --> 58:59.740
 Yeah, what do you make of the other big player, China?

59:01.460 --> 59:05.380
 They seem to have a very different messed up,

59:05.380 --> 59:09.500
 but also functioning system.

59:09.500 --> 59:13.860
 They seem to be much better at encouraging entrepreneurs.

59:13.860 --> 59:15.660
 They're choosing winners,

59:15.660 --> 59:18.340
 but what do you make of the entire Chinese system?

59:18.340 --> 59:22.500
 Why does it work as well as it does currently?

59:22.500 --> 59:24.340
 What are your concerns about it,

59:24.340 --> 59:28.180
 and what are its threats to the United States,

59:28.180 --> 59:32.780
 or possible, what is it you said,

59:32.780 --> 59:34.900
 wisdom isn't when two ideas come together,

59:34.900 --> 59:36.940
 is there some possible benefits

59:36.940 --> 59:40.420
 of these kinds of ideas coming together?

59:40.420 --> 59:42.940
 It's amazing what China has done,

59:42.940 --> 59:44.780
 but I would say to put it in perspective,

59:44.780 --> 59:47.700
 if you compare them to Japan, South Korea, Taiwan,

59:47.700 --> 59:49.500
 Hong Kong, and Singapore,

59:49.500 --> 59:53.460
 they've still done much worse, not even close.

59:53.460 --> 59:55.140
 And that's both living standards,

59:55.140 --> 59:58.060
 or I hesitate to cite democracy

59:58.060 --> 1:00:00.620
 as an unalloyed good in and of itself,

1:00:00.620 --> 1:00:04.020
 but there's more freedom in all those other places by a lot.

1:00:04.020 --> 1:00:07.100
 So China has all these problems of history,

1:00:07.100 --> 1:00:09.580
 but they've managed, as actually the Soviets did

1:00:09.580 --> 1:00:11.380
 in the middle of the 20th century,

1:00:12.300 --> 1:00:14.020
 one of the two great mass migrations

1:00:14.020 --> 1:00:15.780
 from the countryside to cities,

1:00:15.780 --> 1:00:18.220
 which boosts productivity enormously

1:00:18.220 --> 1:00:21.020
 and will sustain totalitarian systems,

1:00:21.020 --> 1:00:24.620
 but they moved from a totalitarian system to an oligarchy

1:00:24.620 --> 1:00:29.140
 where the CCP is actually, at least for a while,

1:00:29.140 --> 1:00:31.140
 hey, have been really good at governing,

1:00:31.140 --> 1:00:33.740
 have made a lot of very good decisions.

1:00:33.740 --> 1:00:35.580
 You have to admit that.

1:00:35.580 --> 1:00:38.420
 I don't know how long that streak will continue

1:00:38.420 --> 1:00:43.420
 with one person so much now holding authority

1:00:43.420 --> 1:00:45.820
 in a more extreme manner.

1:00:45.820 --> 1:00:48.140
 The selection pressures for the next generation

1:00:48.140 --> 1:00:52.620
 of high level CCP members probably become much worse.

1:00:52.620 --> 1:00:55.260
 You have this general problem of the state owned enterprise

1:00:55.260 --> 1:00:57.100
 is losing relative productivity

1:00:57.100 --> 1:00:58.780
 compared to the private sector.

1:00:58.780 --> 1:01:02.620
 Well, we're gonna kind of hold Jack Ma on this island

1:01:02.620 --> 1:01:05.260
 and he can only issue like weird hello statements.

1:01:06.140 --> 1:01:08.660
 It kind of smells bad to me.

1:01:08.660 --> 1:01:10.900
 I don't feel that it's about to crash,

1:01:10.900 --> 1:01:14.740
 but I don't see them supplanting America

1:01:14.740 --> 1:01:17.300
 as like the world's number one country.

1:01:17.300 --> 1:01:19.260
 I think they will muddle through

1:01:19.260 --> 1:01:21.740
 and have very serious problems,

1:01:21.740 --> 1:01:24.020
 but there's enough talent there they will muddle through.

1:01:24.020 --> 1:01:26.620
 Is there ideas from China or from anywhere in general

1:01:26.620 --> 1:01:29.340
 of large scale role of government

1:01:29.340 --> 1:01:30.500
 that you find might be useful?

1:01:30.500 --> 1:01:33.780
 Like Andrew Yang recently ran on a platform,

1:01:33.780 --> 1:01:37.140
 UBI, right, Universal Basic Income.

1:01:37.140 --> 1:01:42.140
 Is there some interesting ideas of large scale

1:01:43.500 --> 1:01:47.580
 government sort of welfare programs at scale

1:01:47.580 --> 1:01:50.380
 that you find interesting?

1:01:51.700 --> 1:01:54.260
 Well, keep in mind the current version

1:01:54.260 --> 1:01:57.900
 of the Chinese Communist Party post now dismantled

1:01:57.900 --> 1:02:00.020
 what was called the iron rice ball.

1:02:00.020 --> 1:02:02.340
 So it took apart the healthcare protections,

1:02:02.340 --> 1:02:05.900
 a lot of the welfare system, a lot of the guaranteed jobs.

1:02:05.900 --> 1:02:08.100
 So the economic rise of China coincided

1:02:08.100 --> 1:02:10.500
 with the weakening of welfare.

1:02:10.500 --> 1:02:12.980
 I'm not saying that's causal per se,

1:02:12.980 --> 1:02:16.820
 but people think of China as having a government

1:02:16.820 --> 1:02:19.460
 that takes care of everyone, it's very far from the truth.

1:02:19.460 --> 1:02:20.900
 And by a lot of metrics,

1:02:20.900 --> 1:02:23.540
 I don't mean control over people's lives,

1:02:23.540 --> 1:02:25.820
 I don't mean speech, but by a lot of metrics,

1:02:25.820 --> 1:02:28.900
 economically we have a lot more government than they do.

1:02:28.900 --> 1:02:32.740
 So what one means here by like government, private control,

1:02:32.740 --> 1:02:35.100
 I don't think you can just add up the numbers

1:02:35.100 --> 1:02:36.740
 and get a simple answer.

1:02:36.740 --> 1:02:40.780
 They've been fantastic at building infrastructure in cities

1:02:40.780 --> 1:02:44.020
 in ways that will attract people from the countryside.

1:02:44.020 --> 1:02:47.540
 And furthermore, they more or less enforce a meritocracy

1:02:47.540 --> 1:02:48.980
 in this sense.

1:02:48.980 --> 1:02:51.380
 Like if you're a kid of a rich guy,

1:02:51.380 --> 1:02:53.220
 you'll get unfair privilege.

1:02:53.220 --> 1:02:56.020
 That's unfair, but systems can afford that.

1:02:56.020 --> 1:02:57.820
 If you are smart and from the countryside

1:02:57.820 --> 1:02:59.780
 and your parents have nothing,

1:02:59.780 --> 1:03:02.620
 you will be elevated and sent to a very good school,

1:03:02.620 --> 1:03:05.180
 graduate school because of the exam system.

1:03:05.180 --> 1:03:08.580
 And they do that and they mean that very consistently.

1:03:08.580 --> 1:03:10.260
 It's like the Soviets had a version of that

1:03:10.260 --> 1:03:12.460
 like for chess and romantic piano.

1:03:12.460 --> 1:03:14.980
 Not for everything, but where they had it,

1:03:14.980 --> 1:03:17.420
 like again, they were tremendous, right?

1:03:17.420 --> 1:03:18.260
 Yeah, exactly.

1:03:18.260 --> 1:03:21.060
 And Chinese have it in so many areas,

1:03:21.060 --> 1:03:23.580
 a genuine meritocracy in this one way.

1:03:23.580 --> 1:03:26.460
 That moves people from the rural to the big city

1:03:26.460 --> 1:03:29.060
 and that's a big boost of productivity

1:03:29.060 --> 1:03:30.500
 for some amount of time.

1:03:30.500 --> 1:03:32.300
 And when they get there, they're taken seriously.

1:03:32.300 --> 1:03:34.020
 Jack Ma was riding a bicycle,

1:03:34.020 --> 1:03:35.740
 teaching English in his late 20s.

1:03:35.740 --> 1:03:36.780
 He was a poor guy.

1:03:39.180 --> 1:03:41.540
 Not a society of credentialism.

1:03:41.540 --> 1:03:45.460
 Or in America, it's way too much a credentialist society.

1:03:45.460 --> 1:03:47.940
 As we're talking about even with the Nobel Prize.

1:03:47.940 --> 1:03:51.340
 But what do you think about these large government programs

1:03:51.340 --> 1:03:53.180
 like UBI?

1:03:53.180 --> 1:03:55.860
 The one version of UBI that makes the most sense to me

1:03:55.860 --> 1:03:59.300
 is the Mitt Romney version, UBI for kids.

1:03:59.300 --> 1:04:00.660
 Like kids are vulnerable.

1:04:00.660 --> 1:04:03.060
 If their parents screw up, you shouldn't blame the kid

1:04:03.060 --> 1:04:04.980
 or make the kids suffer.

1:04:04.980 --> 1:04:07.580
 I believe in something like UBI for kids.

1:04:07.580 --> 1:04:08.740
 Maybe just cash.

1:04:09.900 --> 1:04:13.540
 But if you don't have kids, even with AI,

1:04:13.540 --> 1:04:16.420
 my sense is at least in the world we know,

1:04:16.420 --> 1:04:19.020
 you should be able to find a way to adjust.

1:04:19.020 --> 1:04:22.820
 You might have to move to North Dakota to work,

1:04:24.420 --> 1:04:26.020
 next to fracking, say.

1:04:26.020 --> 1:04:28.100
 But look, before the pandemic,

1:04:28.100 --> 1:04:30.540
 the two most robot intensive societies,

1:04:30.540 --> 1:04:33.940
 Japan and the US, US at least for manufacturing,

1:04:33.940 --> 1:04:35.860
 were at full employment.

1:04:35.860 --> 1:04:37.700
 So maybe there's some far off day

1:04:37.700 --> 1:04:39.660
 where there's literally no work, John Lennon,

1:04:39.660 --> 1:04:43.100
 and imagine it's piped everywhere.

1:04:44.060 --> 1:04:47.020
 And then we might revisit the question.

1:04:47.020 --> 1:04:51.020
 But for now, we had rising wages in the Trump years

1:04:51.020 --> 1:04:52.540
 and full employment.

1:04:52.540 --> 1:04:54.580
 So I don't see the point.

1:04:54.580 --> 1:04:57.580
 You don't see automation as a threat

1:04:57.580 --> 1:05:00.340
 that fundamentally shakes our society.

1:05:00.340 --> 1:05:01.940
 It's a threat in the following sense.

1:05:01.940 --> 1:05:04.220
 The new technologies are harder to work with

1:05:04.220 --> 1:05:07.260
 for many people, and that's a social problem.

1:05:07.260 --> 1:05:10.420
 But I'm not sure a universal basic income

1:05:10.420 --> 1:05:13.460
 is the right answer to that very real problem.

1:05:13.460 --> 1:05:16.780
 Well, that's also, I like the UBI for kids.

1:05:16.780 --> 1:05:20.260
 It's also your definition or the line,

1:05:20.260 --> 1:05:21.940
 the threshold for what is vulnerable

1:05:21.940 --> 1:05:24.740
 and what is basic human nature.

1:05:24.740 --> 1:05:27.020
 Going back to Russia, life is suffering.

1:05:27.860 --> 1:05:31.220
 That struggle is a part of life.

1:05:31.220 --> 1:05:33.700
 And perhaps sort of changing,

1:05:33.700 --> 1:05:36.460
 maybe what defines the 21st century

1:05:36.460 --> 1:05:38.100
 is having multiple careers

1:05:38.100 --> 1:05:41.140
 and adjusting and learning and evolving.

1:05:41.140 --> 1:05:45.540
 And some of the technology in terms of,

1:05:46.980 --> 1:05:50.620
 some of the technology we see like the internet

1:05:50.620 --> 1:05:55.620
 allows us to make those pivots easier,

1:05:55.820 --> 1:05:59.060
 allows later life education possible.

1:05:59.060 --> 1:06:00.700
 It makes it possible.

1:06:00.700 --> 1:06:01.540
 I don't know.

1:06:01.540 --> 1:06:03.100
 And your earlier point about loneliness

1:06:03.100 --> 1:06:04.700
 being this fundamental human problem,

1:06:04.700 --> 1:06:07.220
 which I would agree with strongly,

1:06:07.220 --> 1:06:10.260
 UBI, if it's at a high level, will make that worse.

1:06:10.260 --> 1:06:11.700
 I mean, say UBI were higher enough,

1:06:11.700 --> 1:06:13.060
 you could just sit at home.

1:06:14.900 --> 1:06:16.460
 People are not gonna be happy.

1:06:16.460 --> 1:06:18.300
 They don't actually want that.

1:06:18.300 --> 1:06:21.500
 And we've relearned that in the pandemic.

1:06:21.500 --> 1:06:24.060
 Yeah, the flip side, the hope with UBI

1:06:24.060 --> 1:06:26.340
 is you have a little bit more freedom

1:06:26.340 --> 1:06:29.260
 to find the thing that alleviates your loneliness.

1:06:29.260 --> 1:06:30.740
 That's the idea.

1:06:30.740 --> 1:06:33.340
 So it's kind of an open question.

1:06:33.340 --> 1:06:38.260
 If I give you a million dollars or a billion dollars,

1:06:38.260 --> 1:06:41.660
 will you pursue the thing you love?

1:06:41.660 --> 1:06:45.820
 Will you be more motivated to find the thing you love,

1:06:45.820 --> 1:06:46.700
 to do the thing you love,

1:06:46.700 --> 1:06:50.140
 or will you be lazy and lose yourself

1:06:50.140 --> 1:06:52.340
 in the sort of daily activities

1:06:52.340 --> 1:06:54.860
 that don't actually bring you joy,

1:06:54.860 --> 1:06:57.700
 but pacify you in some kind of way

1:06:57.700 --> 1:07:01.300
 where you just let the days slip by?

1:07:01.300 --> 1:07:02.740
 That's the open question.

1:07:02.740 --> 1:07:05.580
 A lot of the great creators did not have huge cushions,

1:07:05.580 --> 1:07:07.580
 whether it was Mozart or James Brown

1:07:07.580 --> 1:07:10.300
 or the great painters in history,

1:07:10.300 --> 1:07:12.380
 they had to work pretty hard.

1:07:12.380 --> 1:07:15.300
 And if you look at heirs to great fortunes,

1:07:15.300 --> 1:07:16.780
 maybe I'm forgetting someone,

1:07:16.780 --> 1:07:18.620
 but it's hard to think of any

1:07:18.620 --> 1:07:21.860
 who have creatively been important as novelists,

1:07:21.860 --> 1:07:25.940
 or they might have continued to run the family business.

1:07:25.940 --> 1:07:30.700
 But Van Gogh was not heir to a great family fortune.

1:07:30.700 --> 1:07:34.460
 It's sad that cushions get in the way of progress.

1:07:37.100 --> 1:07:39.820
 It's the same point about prizes, right?

1:07:39.820 --> 1:07:42.300
 Inheriting too much money is like winning a prize.

1:07:42.300 --> 1:07:45.780
 We mentioned Eric, Eric Weinstein.

1:07:45.780 --> 1:07:47.180
 I know you agree on a bunch of things.

1:07:47.180 --> 1:07:49.260
 Is there some beautiful, fascinating,

1:07:49.260 --> 1:07:51.700
 insightful disagreement that you have

1:07:51.700 --> 1:07:54.100
 that has yet to be resolved with him?

1:07:54.100 --> 1:07:58.140
 Is there some ideas that you guys battle it out on?

1:07:58.140 --> 1:08:00.560
 Is it the stagnation question that you mentioned?

1:08:00.560 --> 1:08:03.760
 That's one of them, but here's at least two others.

1:08:05.180 --> 1:08:08.000
 But I would stress Eric is always evolving.

1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:10.700
 So I'm just talking about a time slice Eric, right?

1:08:10.700 --> 1:08:12.940
 I don't know where he's at right now.

1:08:12.940 --> 1:08:15.020
 Like I heard him on Clubhouse three nights ago,

1:08:15.020 --> 1:08:16.580
 but that was three nights ago.

1:08:17.780 --> 1:08:20.060
 But I think he's far too pessimistic

1:08:20.060 --> 1:08:23.500
 about the impact of immigration on U.S. science.

1:08:23.500 --> 1:08:26.580
 He thinks it has displaced U.S. scientists,

1:08:26.580 --> 1:08:28.700
 which I think that is partly true.

1:08:28.700 --> 1:08:30.300
 I just think we've gotten better talent.

1:08:30.300 --> 1:08:33.180
 I'm like, bring it on, double down.

1:08:33.180 --> 1:08:35.820
 And look at Kiriko, who basically came up

1:08:35.820 --> 1:08:37.980
 with mRNA vaccines, she was from Hungary.

1:08:37.980 --> 1:08:41.140
 And was ridiculed and mocked,

1:08:41.140 --> 1:08:42.780
 she couldn't get her papers published.

1:08:42.780 --> 1:08:43.820
 She stuck at it.

1:08:44.920 --> 1:08:47.900
 An American might not have been so stubborn

1:08:47.900 --> 1:08:49.760
 because we have these cushions.

1:08:49.760 --> 1:08:52.860
 So Eric is all worried, like mathematicians coming in,

1:08:52.860 --> 1:08:56.940
 they're discouraging native U.S. citizens from doing math.

1:08:56.940 --> 1:08:59.460
 I'm like, bring in the best people.

1:08:59.460 --> 1:09:02.720
 If we all end up in other avocations,

1:09:02.720 --> 1:09:04.100
 absolutely fine by me.

1:09:04.100 --> 1:09:06.820
 Does it trouble you that we kick them out

1:09:06.820 --> 1:09:08.700
 after they get a degree often?

1:09:08.700 --> 1:09:11.460
 I would give anyone with a plausible graduate degree

1:09:11.460 --> 1:09:13.460
 a green card, universally.

1:09:13.460 --> 1:09:17.140
 Yeah, I agree with that, it makes no sense.

1:09:17.140 --> 1:09:19.940
 It makes so strange that the best people that come here

1:09:19.940 --> 1:09:22.660
 suffer here, create awesome stuff here,

1:09:22.660 --> 1:09:24.460
 then when we kick them out, it doesn't make any sense.

1:09:24.460 --> 1:09:25.580
 Here's another view I have.

1:09:25.580 --> 1:09:27.720
 I call it open borders for Belarus.

1:09:29.140 --> 1:09:30.340
 Now Russia's a big country.

1:09:30.340 --> 1:09:33.460
 I would gladly increase the Russian quota

1:09:33.460 --> 1:09:38.460
 by three X, four X, five X, not 20%, but a big boost.

1:09:39.380 --> 1:09:44.300
 But Belarus, a small country, and they're poor,

1:09:44.300 --> 1:09:47.780
 and they have decent education, and a lot of talent there.

1:09:47.780 --> 1:09:50.140
 Why can't we just open the door

1:09:50.140 --> 1:09:53.500
 and convert a Belarus passport to a green card?

1:09:53.500 --> 1:09:56.660
 Open borders for Belarus, it's my new campaign slogan.

1:09:56.660 --> 1:09:58.740
 Are you running for president in 2024?

1:09:58.740 --> 1:10:00.460
 Well, write ins are welcome, but.

1:10:00.460 --> 1:10:04.380
 Okay, what's the second thing you disagree with, Eric?

1:10:05.700 --> 1:10:10.220
 Trade, again, I'm not sure where he's at now,

1:10:10.220 --> 1:10:14.820
 but he is suspicious of trade in a way that I am not.

1:10:14.820 --> 1:10:17.300
 I do understand what's called the China shock

1:10:17.300 --> 1:10:19.860
 has been a big problem for the US middle class.

1:10:19.860 --> 1:10:21.380
 I fully accept that.

1:10:21.380 --> 1:10:24.020
 I think most of that is behind us.

1:10:24.020 --> 1:10:25.960
 National security issues aside,

1:10:25.960 --> 1:10:29.200
 I think free trade is very much a good thing.

1:10:29.200 --> 1:10:33.060
 Eric, I'm not sure he'll say it's not a good thing,

1:10:33.060 --> 1:10:34.840
 but he won't say it is a good thing.

1:10:34.840 --> 1:10:38.160
 And I know he's kind of, it's like, Eric, free trade.

1:10:39.420 --> 1:10:40.920
 But look, on things like vaccines,

1:10:40.920 --> 1:10:42.880
 I don't believe in free trade.

1:10:42.880 --> 1:10:45.540
 You want vaccine production in your own country,

1:10:45.540 --> 1:10:47.000
 look at the EU.

1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:50.160
 They have enough money, no one will send them vaccines.

1:10:50.160 --> 1:10:51.940
 What's different about vaccines?

1:10:51.940 --> 1:10:54.520
 Is it, there's some things you want to prioritize

1:10:54.520 --> 1:10:56.440
 the citizenry on.

1:10:56.440 --> 1:10:58.120
 You could argue it would be cheaper

1:10:58.120 --> 1:11:02.040
 to produce all US manufactured vaccines in India.

1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:05.960
 They have the technologies, obviously lower wages,

1:11:05.960 --> 1:11:07.560
 but look, there's talk in India right now

1:11:07.560 --> 1:11:09.880
 of cutting off the export of vaccines.

1:11:09.880 --> 1:11:12.000
 If you outsource your vaccine production,

1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:13.400
 you're not sure the other country

1:11:13.400 --> 1:11:15.840
 will respect the norm of free trade.

1:11:15.840 --> 1:11:20.160
 So you need to keep some vaccine production in your country.

1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:22.560
 It's an exception to free trade, not to the logic,

1:11:24.760 --> 1:11:26.480
 a bunch of things the Navy uses.

1:11:26.480 --> 1:11:28.520
 You can't buy those components from China.

1:11:28.520 --> 1:11:29.380
 That's insane.

1:11:31.520 --> 1:11:34.140
 But look, it would be cheaper to do so, right?

1:11:34.140 --> 1:11:35.360
 Yeah.

1:11:35.360 --> 1:11:37.360
 Let me completely shift topics

1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:38.720
 on something that's fascinating.

1:11:38.720 --> 1:11:40.960
 It's all the same topic, but great.

1:11:40.960 --> 1:11:42.880
 Everything is interesting.

1:11:45.560 --> 1:11:48.800
 What do you think about what the hell is money?

1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:53.800
 And the recent excitement around cryptocurrency

1:11:56.880 --> 1:12:01.120
 that brings to the forefront

1:12:01.120 --> 1:12:04.880
 the philosophical discussion of the nature of money.

1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:06.840
 Are you bullish on cryptocurrency?

1:12:06.840 --> 1:12:07.900
 Are you excited about it?

1:12:07.900 --> 1:12:09.560
 What does it make you think about

1:12:09.560 --> 1:12:11.840
 how the nature of money is changing?

1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:13.720
 No one knows what money is.

1:12:13.720 --> 1:12:15.560
 Probably no one ever knew.

1:12:15.560 --> 1:12:17.920
 Go back to medieval times, bills of exchange.

1:12:17.920 --> 1:12:19.460
 Were they money?

1:12:19.460 --> 1:12:21.500
 Maybe it's just a semantic debate.

1:12:21.500 --> 1:12:23.360
 Gold, silver, what about copper coins?

1:12:23.360 --> 1:12:26.380
 What about metals that were considered legal tender

1:12:26.380 --> 1:12:28.280
 but not always circulating?

1:12:28.280 --> 1:12:29.700
 What about credit?

1:12:29.700 --> 1:12:32.480
 So being confused about moneyness

1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:35.240
 is the natural state of affairs for human beings.

1:12:35.240 --> 1:12:36.240
 And if there's more of that,

1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:38.880
 I'd say that's probably a good thing.

1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:42.920
 Now, crypto per se, I think Bitcoin has taken over

1:12:42.920 --> 1:12:45.560
 a lot of the space held by gold.

1:12:45.560 --> 1:12:48.160
 That to me seems sustainable.

1:12:48.160 --> 1:12:50.360
 I'm not short Bitcoin.

1:12:50.360 --> 1:12:53.460
 I don't have some view that the price

1:12:53.460 --> 1:12:55.100
 has to be different than the current price,

1:12:55.100 --> 1:12:56.840
 but I know it changes every moment.

1:12:58.360 --> 1:13:01.180
 I am deeply uncertain about the less of crypto,

1:13:01.180 --> 1:13:04.480
 which seems connected to ultimate visions

1:13:04.480 --> 1:13:09.360
 of using it for transactions in ways where I'm not sure

1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:12.460
 whether it be prediction markets or DeFi.

1:13:12.460 --> 1:13:16.200
 I'm not sure the retail demand really is there

1:13:16.200 --> 1:13:18.520
 once it is regulated like everything else is.

1:13:19.500 --> 1:13:24.360
 I would say I'm 40, 60 optimistic on those forms of crypto.

1:13:24.360 --> 1:13:26.020
 That is, I think it's somewhat more likely

1:13:26.020 --> 1:13:29.140
 they fail than succeed, but I take them very seriously.

1:13:29.140 --> 1:13:31.160
 So we're talking about it becoming

1:13:31.160 --> 1:13:32.920
 one of the main currencies in the world.

1:13:32.920 --> 1:13:33.760
 That's what we're discussing.

1:13:33.760 --> 1:13:35.720
 That I don't think will happen.

1:13:35.720 --> 1:13:40.420
 So, but the reality is that Bitcoin used to be

1:13:40.420 --> 1:13:44.720
 in the single digits of a dollar and now has crossed $50,000

1:13:44.720 --> 1:13:46.600
 for a single Bitcoin.

1:13:46.600 --> 1:13:48.600
 Do you think it's possible it reaches

1:13:48.600 --> 1:13:50.300
 something like a million dollars?

1:13:51.480 --> 1:13:54.280
 I don't think we have a good theory of the value of Bitcoin.

1:13:54.280 --> 1:13:56.160
 If people decide it's worth a million dollars,

1:13:56.160 --> 1:13:57.760
 it's worth a million dollars.

1:13:57.760 --> 1:13:58.600
 But isn't that money?

1:13:58.600 --> 1:14:01.640
 Like you said, isn't the ultimate state of money confusion,

1:14:01.640 --> 1:14:03.200
 however beautifully you put it?

1:14:03.200 --> 1:14:05.040
 It's like valuing an Andy Warhol painting.

1:14:05.040 --> 1:14:06.960
 So when Warhol started off,

1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:08.880
 probably those things had no value.

1:14:08.880 --> 1:14:11.560
 They were sketches, early sketches of shoes.

1:14:11.560 --> 1:14:14.960
 Now a good Warhol could be worth over 50 million.

1:14:14.960 --> 1:14:17.600
 That's an incredible rate of price appreciation.

1:14:17.600 --> 1:14:20.640
 Bitcoin is seeing a similar trajectory.

1:14:20.640 --> 1:14:23.780
 I don't pretend to know where it will stop,

1:14:23.780 --> 1:14:25.240
 but it's about trying to figure out

1:14:25.240 --> 1:14:26.760
 what do people think of Andy Warhol?

1:14:26.760 --> 1:14:29.600
 He could be out of fashion in a century.

1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:31.220
 Maybe yes, maybe no.

1:14:32.680 --> 1:14:35.300
 But you don't think about Warhols as money.

1:14:36.560 --> 1:14:38.640
 They perform some money like functions.

1:14:38.640 --> 1:14:40.640
 You can even use them as collateral

1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:42.400
 for like deals between gangs.

1:14:43.520 --> 1:14:46.880
 But they're not basically money, nor is Bitcoin.

1:14:46.880 --> 1:14:48.960
 And the transactions velocity of Bitcoin,

1:14:48.960 --> 1:14:51.320
 I would think is likely to fall, if anything.

1:14:51.320 --> 1:14:53.320
 So you don't think there'll be some kind of phase shift

1:14:53.320 --> 1:14:55.440
 where it become adopted and become mainstream

1:14:55.440 --> 1:15:00.200
 for one of the main mechanisms of transactions?

1:15:00.200 --> 1:15:01.020
 Bitcoin, no.

1:15:01.020 --> 1:15:03.380
 Now, you know, ether has some chance at that.

1:15:03.380 --> 1:15:04.840
 I would bet against it,

1:15:04.840 --> 1:15:06.840
 but I wouldn't give you a definitive no.

1:15:06.840 --> 1:15:07.680
 And you wouldn't put us here.

1:15:07.680 --> 1:15:09.020
 Bitcoin is too costly.

1:15:10.160 --> 1:15:12.400
 It may be fine to hold it like gold,

1:15:12.400 --> 1:15:13.920
 but gold is also costly.

1:15:15.200 --> 1:15:18.360
 You have smart people trying to make, say, ether,

1:15:18.360 --> 1:15:21.600
 much more effective as a currency than Bitcoin.

1:15:22.560 --> 1:15:25.600
 And there's certainly a decent chance they will succeed.

1:15:25.600 --> 1:15:26.720
 Yeah, there's a lot of innovation.

1:15:26.720 --> 1:15:30.120
 I mean, with smart contracts, with NFTs as well,

1:15:30.120 --> 1:15:33.440
 there's a lot of interesting innovations

1:15:33.440 --> 1:15:36.120
 that are plugging into the human psyche somehow,

1:15:36.120 --> 1:15:37.760
 just like money does.

1:15:37.760 --> 1:15:41.360
 You know, money seems to be this viral thing,

1:15:41.360 --> 1:15:43.080
 our ideas of money, right?

1:15:43.080 --> 1:15:45.360
 And if the idea is strong enough,

1:15:45.360 --> 1:15:47.740
 it seems to be able to take hold.

1:15:47.740 --> 1:15:50.880
 Like there's network effects that just take over.

1:15:50.880 --> 1:15:54.060
 And like, I particularly see that with,

1:15:54.060 --> 1:15:57.400
 I'd love to get your comment on Dogecoin,

1:15:57.400 --> 1:15:59.760
 which is basically by a single human being,

1:15:59.760 --> 1:16:01.400
 Elon Musk has been created.

1:16:01.400 --> 1:16:03.200
 You know, it's like these celebrities

1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:07.160
 can have a huge ripple effect on the impact of money.

1:16:07.160 --> 1:16:11.560
 Is it possible that in the 21st century,

1:16:11.560 --> 1:16:13.840
 people like Elon Musk and celebrities,

1:16:13.840 --> 1:16:16.120
 I don't know, Donald Trump, The Rock,

1:16:16.120 --> 1:16:20.680
 whoever else, can actually define,

1:16:20.680 --> 1:16:22.320
 you know, the currencies that we use?

1:16:22.320 --> 1:16:26.000
 Maybe can Dogecoin become the primary currency of the world?

1:16:27.400 --> 1:16:29.280
 I think of it as like baseball cards.

1:16:29.280 --> 1:16:32.800
 So right now, every baseball player has a baseball card.

1:16:32.800 --> 1:16:34.120
 And the players who are stars,

1:16:34.120 --> 1:16:37.280
 their cards can end up worth a fair amount of money.

1:16:37.280 --> 1:16:39.680
 And that's stable, we've had it for many decades.

1:16:40.780 --> 1:16:42.840
 Sort of the player defines the card,

1:16:42.840 --> 1:16:46.200
 they sign a contract with Topps or whatever company.

1:16:46.200 --> 1:16:49.040
 Now, could you imagine celebrities, baseball players,

1:16:49.040 --> 1:16:53.000
 LeBron James, having their own currencies instead of cards?

1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:55.960
 Absolutely, and you're somewhat seeing that right now,

1:16:55.960 --> 1:16:58.320
 as you mentioned, artists with these unique works

1:16:58.320 --> 1:16:59.340
 on the blockchain.

1:16:59.340 --> 1:17:02.340
 But I'm not sure those are macroeconomically important.

1:17:02.340 --> 1:17:04.140
 If it's just a new class of collectibles

1:17:04.140 --> 1:17:07.380
 that people have fun with, again, I say, bring it on.

1:17:08.260 --> 1:17:11.140
 But whether there are use cases beyond that,

1:17:11.140 --> 1:17:15.380
 that challenge fiat monies, which actually work very well.

1:17:15.380 --> 1:17:19.340
 Yesterday, I sent money to a family in Ethiopia

1:17:19.340 --> 1:17:21.100
 that I helped support.

1:17:21.100 --> 1:17:24.020
 In less than 24 hours, they got that money.

1:17:24.020 --> 1:17:26.300
 Digitally, yes.

1:17:26.300 --> 1:17:28.340
 No, not digitally, through my bank.

1:17:28.340 --> 1:17:32.220
 My primitive dinosaur bank, BB&T, Mid Atlantic Bank,

1:17:32.220 --> 1:17:34.500
 headquartered in North Carolina,

1:17:34.500 --> 1:17:38.340
 charted by the Fed, regulated by the FDAC and the OCC.

1:17:38.340 --> 1:17:41.620
 Now, you could say, well, the exchange rate was not so great.

1:17:44.220 --> 1:17:46.580
 I don't see crypto as close to beating that

1:17:46.580 --> 1:17:49.500
 once you take into account all of the last mile problems.

1:17:50.580 --> 1:17:52.660
 Fiat currency works really well.

1:17:52.660 --> 1:17:54.820
 People are not sitting around bitching about it.

1:17:54.820 --> 1:17:56.260
 And when you talk to crypto people,

1:17:56.260 --> 1:17:58.500
 they're crypto people, the number who have to postulate

1:17:58.500 --> 1:18:00.700
 some out of the blue hyperinflation,

1:18:00.700 --> 1:18:03.300
 where there's no evidence for that whatsoever,

1:18:03.300 --> 1:18:06.060
 that to me is a sign they're not thinking clearly

1:18:06.060 --> 1:18:07.620
 about how hard they have to work

1:18:07.620 --> 1:18:09.220
 to outcompete fiat currency.

1:18:10.060 --> 1:18:11.860
 There's a bunch of different technologies

1:18:11.860 --> 1:18:15.860
 that are really exciting that don't want to address

1:18:15.860 --> 1:18:17.780
 how difficult it is to outcompete

1:18:17.780 --> 1:18:19.220
 the current accepted alternative.

1:18:19.220 --> 1:18:21.780
 So for example, autonomous vehicles.

1:18:21.780 --> 1:18:24.100
 A lot of people are really excited.

1:18:24.100 --> 1:18:28.060
 But it's not trivial to outcompete Uber

1:18:28.060 --> 1:18:32.300
 on the cost and the effectiveness and the user experience

1:18:32.300 --> 1:18:34.940
 and all those kinds of, sorry, Uber driven by humans.

1:18:34.940 --> 1:18:39.380
 And it's not, you know, that's taken for granted,

1:18:39.380 --> 1:18:41.980
 I think, that look, wouldn't it be amazing,

1:18:41.980 --> 1:18:43.260
 how amazing would the world look

1:18:43.260 --> 1:18:45.580
 when the cars are driving themselves fully,

1:18:45.580 --> 1:18:47.220
 you know, it's gonna drive the cost down,

1:18:47.220 --> 1:18:48.620
 you can remove the cost of drivers,

1:18:48.620 --> 1:18:50.180
 all those kinds of things.

1:18:50.180 --> 1:18:52.180
 But it's when you actually get down to it

1:18:52.180 --> 1:18:53.620
 and have to build a business around it,

1:18:53.620 --> 1:18:55.500
 it's actually very difficult to do.

1:18:55.500 --> 1:18:56.860
 And I guess you're saying your sense

1:18:56.860 --> 1:19:00.300
 is similar competition is facing cryptocurrency.

1:19:00.300 --> 1:19:05.300
 Like you have to actually present a killer app reason

1:19:06.740 --> 1:19:11.740
 to switch from fiat currency to Ethereum or to whatever.

1:19:12.900 --> 1:19:15.500
 And the Biden people are gonna regulate crypto

1:19:15.500 --> 1:19:16.980
 and they're gonna do it soon.

1:19:16.980 --> 1:19:20.700
 So something like DeFi, I fully get why that is cheaper

1:19:20.700 --> 1:19:23.300
 or for some can be cheaper than other ways

1:19:23.300 --> 1:19:25.620
 of conducting financial intermediation.

1:19:25.620 --> 1:19:28.500
 But some of that is regulatory arbitrage.

1:19:28.500 --> 1:19:30.740
 It will not be allowed to go on forever

1:19:30.740 --> 1:19:32.300
 for better or worse.

1:19:32.300 --> 1:19:35.140
 I would rather see it given greater tolerance.

1:19:35.140 --> 1:19:37.540
 But the point is banking lobby is strong.

1:19:37.540 --> 1:19:39.980
 The government will only let it run so far.

1:19:39.980 --> 1:19:41.380
 There'll be capital requirements,

1:19:41.380 --> 1:19:43.420
 reporting requirements imposed,

1:19:43.420 --> 1:19:45.580
 and it will lose a lot of those advantages.

1:19:46.620 --> 1:19:48.820
 What do you make of Wall Street bets?

1:19:48.820 --> 1:19:50.620
 Another thing that recently happened

1:19:50.620 --> 1:19:54.700
 that shook the world and at least me

1:19:54.700 --> 1:19:56.860
 from the outside of perspective,

1:19:56.860 --> 1:19:58.500
 make me question what I do

1:19:58.500 --> 1:20:01.380
 and don't understand about our economics.

1:20:01.380 --> 1:20:03.500
 Which is a bunch of different,

1:20:03.500 --> 1:20:05.140
 a large number of individuals

1:20:05.140 --> 1:20:06.780
 getting together on the internet

1:20:06.780 --> 1:20:10.260
 and having a large scale impact on the markets.

1:20:10.260 --> 1:20:11.740
 If you tell a group of people

1:20:11.740 --> 1:20:13.420
 and coordinate them through the internet,

1:20:13.420 --> 1:20:16.060
 we're gonna play a fun game, it might cost you money,

1:20:16.060 --> 1:20:17.460
 but you're gonna make the headlines

1:20:17.460 --> 1:20:18.860
 and there's a chance you'll screw over

1:20:18.860 --> 1:20:20.820
 some billionaires and hedge funds.

1:20:20.820 --> 1:20:23.020
 Enough people will play that game.

1:20:23.020 --> 1:20:24.260
 So that game might continue,

1:20:24.260 --> 1:20:26.900
 but I don't think it's of macroeconomic importance.

1:20:26.900 --> 1:20:30.660
 And the price of those stocks in the medium term

1:20:30.660 --> 1:20:32.980
 will end up wherever it ought to be.

1:20:32.980 --> 1:20:34.980
 So these are little outliers

1:20:34.980 --> 1:20:36.780
 from a macroeconomics perspective.

1:20:36.780 --> 1:20:38.740
 They're not going to,

1:20:38.740 --> 1:20:43.620
 these are not signals of shifting power,

1:20:43.620 --> 1:20:46.300
 like from centralized power to distributed power.

1:20:46.300 --> 1:20:49.220
 These aren't some fundamental changes in the way

1:20:49.220 --> 1:20:50.260
 our economy works.

1:20:50.260 --> 1:20:52.500
 I think of it as a new brand of eSports,

1:20:52.500 --> 1:20:54.140
 maybe more fun than the old brand.

1:20:54.140 --> 1:20:56.340
 Which is fine, right?

1:20:56.340 --> 1:20:58.540
 It's like push the anarchy into the corners

1:20:58.540 --> 1:20:59.660
 where you want it.

1:20:59.660 --> 1:21:02.700
 It doesn't bother me,

1:21:02.700 --> 1:21:04.100
 but I think people are seeing it

1:21:04.100 --> 1:21:05.260
 as more fun than it is.

1:21:05.260 --> 1:21:07.620
 It's a new eSport, more fun for many,

1:21:07.620 --> 1:21:09.940
 but more expensive than the old eSports.

1:21:10.940 --> 1:21:13.660
 Like chess is a new eSport, super cheap,

1:21:13.660 --> 1:21:16.900
 not as fun as like sending hedge funds to their doom,

1:21:16.900 --> 1:21:19.900
 but like, what would you expect?

1:21:19.900 --> 1:21:22.420
 The poetry, I love it, okay.

1:21:22.420 --> 1:21:24.900
 But macroeconomically, it's not fundamental.

1:21:24.900 --> 1:21:27.380
 Okay, I was going to say, I hope you're right,

1:21:27.380 --> 1:21:29.820
 because I'm uncomfortable with the chaos

1:21:29.820 --> 1:21:32.380
 of the masses that's creates.

1:21:32.380 --> 1:21:36.980
 But I also think that chaos is somewhat real to be clear,

1:21:36.980 --> 1:21:40.620
 but it will matter through other channels,

1:21:40.620 --> 1:21:45.620
 not through manipulating GameStop or AMC.

1:21:46.140 --> 1:21:48.540
 So you're seeing the real macro phenomenon.

1:21:48.540 --> 1:21:50.740
 When people see a real macro phenomenon,

1:21:50.740 --> 1:21:54.020
 they tend to make every micro story fit the narrative.

1:21:54.020 --> 1:21:56.220
 And this micro story, like it fits the narrative,

1:21:56.220 --> 1:21:58.980
 but it doesn't mean its importance fits the narrative.

1:21:58.980 --> 1:22:01.780
 That's how I would kind of dissect the mistake

1:22:01.780 --> 1:22:03.020
 I think people are making.

1:22:05.060 --> 1:22:07.820
 The macro phenomenon that are there, do you mean?

1:22:07.820 --> 1:22:10.540
 Everyone's weird now, the internet.

1:22:10.540 --> 1:22:12.980
 Either allows us to be weirder or makes us weirder.

1:22:12.980 --> 1:22:14.540
 I'm not sure what's the right way to put it.

1:22:14.540 --> 1:22:16.420
 Maybe a mix of both.

1:22:16.420 --> 1:22:18.780
 You're probably right that it allows us to be weirder

1:22:18.780 --> 1:22:21.340
 because, well, this is the other, okay.

1:22:21.340 --> 1:22:23.980
 So this connects our previous conversation.

1:22:23.980 --> 1:22:26.660
 Does America allow us to be weirder

1:22:26.660 --> 1:22:29.220
 or does it make us weirder?

1:22:29.220 --> 1:22:32.300
 Like say we're weird and somewhat neurotic to begin with,

1:22:32.300 --> 1:22:34.940
 but the only messages we get are Dwight D. Eisenhower

1:22:34.940 --> 1:22:37.580
 and I Love Lucy and network TV.

1:22:37.580 --> 1:22:40.060
 Like that's going to keep us within certain bounds.

1:22:40.060 --> 1:22:41.660
 In good and bad ways.

1:22:41.660 --> 1:22:43.860
 That's obviously totally gone.

1:22:43.860 --> 1:22:47.020
 And the internet, you can connect to not just QAnon,

1:22:47.020 --> 1:22:47.980
 but all sorts of things.

1:22:47.980 --> 1:22:49.780
 Many of them just fantastic, right?

1:22:51.260 --> 1:22:54.260
 But in good and bad ways, it makes us weirder.

1:22:54.260 --> 1:22:56.700
 So that maybe is troubling, right?

1:22:56.700 --> 1:22:58.020
 Like if someone's worried about that,

1:22:58.020 --> 1:22:59.580
 I would at least say they should

1:22:59.580 --> 1:23:01.500
 give it deep serious thought.

1:23:01.500 --> 1:23:04.620
 And then it has a whole lot of ebbs and flows,

1:23:04.620 --> 1:23:07.580
 micro realizations of the weirdness

1:23:07.580 --> 1:23:09.580
 that don't actually matter.

1:23:09.580 --> 1:23:10.940
 So like chess players today,

1:23:10.940 --> 1:23:12.580
 they play a lot more weird openings

1:23:12.580 --> 1:23:14.580
 than they did 20 years ago.

1:23:14.580 --> 1:23:16.740
 Like it reflects the same thing

1:23:16.740 --> 1:23:19.140
 because you can research any weird opening on the internet,

1:23:19.140 --> 1:23:21.140
 but like, does that matter?

1:23:21.140 --> 1:23:22.460
 Probably not.

1:23:22.460 --> 1:23:23.780
 So a lot of the things we see

1:23:23.780 --> 1:23:26.020
 are just like the weird chess openings.

1:23:26.020 --> 1:23:28.340
 And to figure out which are like the weird chess openings

1:23:28.340 --> 1:23:31.540
 and which are fundamental to the new and growing weirdness,

1:23:31.540 --> 1:23:33.500
 like that's what a hedge fund investor type

1:23:33.500 --> 1:23:35.020
 should be trying to do.

1:23:35.020 --> 1:23:36.900
 I just think no one knows yet.

1:23:36.900 --> 1:23:40.020
 It's like this itself, this fun weird guessing game,

1:23:40.020 --> 1:23:42.220
 which we're partly engaging in right now.

1:23:42.220 --> 1:23:43.260
 Exactly.

1:23:43.260 --> 1:23:45.220
 And I mean, as Eric talks about

1:23:46.180 --> 1:23:47.980
 on the science side of things,

1:23:47.980 --> 1:23:50.100
 I mean, I said like at MIT,

1:23:50.100 --> 1:23:52.460
 especially in the machine learning field,

1:23:52.460 --> 1:23:56.180
 there's a natural institutional resistance to the weird.

1:23:56.180 --> 1:23:58.220
 It's very, as they talk about,

1:23:58.220 --> 1:24:00.940
 it's difficult to hire weird faculty, for example.

1:24:00.940 --> 1:24:01.780
 Correct.

1:24:03.220 --> 1:24:06.380
 You want to hire and give tenure to people that are safe

1:24:06.380 --> 1:24:07.620
 and not weird.

1:24:07.620 --> 1:24:09.700
 And that's one of the concerns is like,

1:24:09.700 --> 1:24:10.980
 it seems like the weird people

1:24:10.980 --> 1:24:13.060
 are the ones that push the science forward usually.

1:24:13.060 --> 1:24:14.060
 Right.

1:24:14.060 --> 1:24:16.620
 And so like, how do you balance the two?

1:24:16.620 --> 1:24:17.820
 It's not obvious.

1:24:17.820 --> 1:24:20.500
 Because it's another area where Eric and I disagree.

1:24:20.500 --> 1:24:21.940
 As I interpret him,

1:24:21.940 --> 1:24:24.460
 he thinks academia is totally bankrupt.

1:24:24.460 --> 1:24:26.540
 And I think it's only partially bankrupt.

1:24:27.860 --> 1:24:28.700
 How do we fix it?

1:24:28.700 --> 1:24:31.980
 Because I'm with you, I'm bullish on academia.

1:24:31.980 --> 1:24:34.180
 You need up and coming schools

1:24:34.180 --> 1:24:36.300
 that end up better than where they started off.

1:24:36.300 --> 1:24:38.420
 And MIT was once one of them.

1:24:38.420 --> 1:24:39.260
 Yes.

1:24:39.260 --> 1:24:40.500
 Now they're not in every area.

1:24:40.500 --> 1:24:42.580
 In some areas, they have become the problem.

1:24:42.580 --> 1:24:43.420
 Yep.

1:24:43.420 --> 1:24:45.220
 UChicago, you wouldn't call it up and coming,

1:24:45.220 --> 1:24:46.300
 but it's still different.

1:24:46.300 --> 1:24:47.140
 And that's great.

1:24:47.140 --> 1:24:49.820
 Let's hope they manage to keep it that way.

1:24:51.100 --> 1:24:55.260
 The biggest problem to me is the rank absurd conformism.

1:24:55.260 --> 1:24:57.060
 I kind of second tier schools,

1:24:57.060 --> 1:24:59.900
 maybe in the top 40, but not in the top dozen,

1:24:59.900 --> 1:25:02.620
 that are just trying to be like a junior MIT,

1:25:02.620 --> 1:25:04.820
 but it's mediocre and copycat.

1:25:04.820 --> 1:25:07.340
 And they're the most dogmatic enforcers of weirdness

1:25:07.340 --> 1:25:09.580
 that like Harvard is more open

1:25:09.580 --> 1:25:11.340
 than those second tier schools.

1:25:11.340 --> 1:25:12.580
 And those second tier schools

1:25:12.580 --> 1:25:13.980
 are pretty good typically, right?

1:25:13.980 --> 1:25:14.820
 Yeah.

1:25:14.820 --> 1:25:17.340
 But the mediocrity is enforced there.

1:25:17.340 --> 1:25:18.180
 Correct.

1:25:18.180 --> 1:25:19.460
 Very strictly.

1:25:19.460 --> 1:25:21.220
 And the homogenization pressures.

1:25:21.220 --> 1:25:24.460
 Climb the rankings by another three places

1:25:24.460 --> 1:25:25.860
 and be a little closer to MIT,

1:25:25.860 --> 1:25:27.260
 though you'll never touch them.

1:25:27.260 --> 1:25:28.740
 That to me is very harmful.

1:25:28.740 --> 1:25:30.900
 And you'd rather they be more like Chicago,

1:25:30.900 --> 1:25:33.940
 more like Caltech, or the older Caltech all the more,

1:25:33.940 --> 1:25:37.380
 like pick some model, be weird in it.

1:25:37.380 --> 1:25:38.900
 You might fail.

1:25:38.900 --> 1:25:40.580
 That's socially better.

1:25:40.580 --> 1:25:43.660
 Yeah, but so the problem with MIT, for example,

1:25:43.660 --> 1:25:48.660
 is the mediocrity is really enforced on the junior faculty.

1:25:49.300 --> 1:25:50.140
 Yeah.

1:25:50.140 --> 1:25:52.620
 So like the people that are allowed to be weird,

1:25:52.620 --> 1:25:54.900
 or actually they just don't even ask for permissions anymore

1:25:54.900 --> 1:25:56.340
 are more senior faculty.

1:25:56.340 --> 1:25:57.780
 And that's good, of course,

1:25:57.780 --> 1:26:00.300
 but you want the weird young people.

1:26:00.300 --> 1:26:05.300
 I find too, this podcast, I like talking to tech people,

1:26:06.220 --> 1:26:08.740
 and I find the young faculty to be really boring.

1:26:08.740 --> 1:26:09.580
 They are.

1:26:09.580 --> 1:26:11.100
 They're the most boring of faculty.

1:26:11.100 --> 1:26:13.740
 Their work is interesting technically,

1:26:13.740 --> 1:26:18.100
 technically, but just the passion.

1:26:18.100 --> 1:26:19.340
 They are drudges.

1:26:19.340 --> 1:26:23.380
 And some of them sneak by.

1:26:23.380 --> 1:26:24.980
 Like you have like the Max Tegmark,

1:26:24.980 --> 1:26:26.420
 young version of Max Tegmark,

1:26:26.420 --> 1:26:31.420
 who knows how to play the role of boring and fitting in.

1:26:31.700 --> 1:26:34.380
 And then on the side, he does the weird shit.

1:26:34.380 --> 1:26:35.380
 Sure.

1:26:35.380 --> 1:26:37.380
 But they're far and few in between,

1:26:37.380 --> 1:26:41.460
 which I'd love to figure out a way to shake up that system

1:26:41.460 --> 1:26:45.140
 because as you look at MIT's Broad Institute, right,

1:26:45.140 --> 1:26:47.300
 in biomedical, it's been a huge hit.

1:26:47.300 --> 1:26:49.420
 I'm not privy to their internal doings,

1:26:49.420 --> 1:26:52.460
 but I suspect they support weird

1:26:52.460 --> 1:26:55.340
 more than the formal departments do at the junior level.

1:26:55.340 --> 1:26:56.500
 Yes, that's probably true.

1:26:56.500 --> 1:26:58.940
 Yeah, I don't know what, whatever they're doing,

1:26:58.940 --> 1:27:03.580
 it's working, but we needed to figure it out

1:27:03.580 --> 1:27:06.700
 because I think the best ideas still do come from the,

1:27:07.660 --> 1:27:10.140
 so forget, my apologies,

1:27:10.140 --> 1:27:11.660
 but for the humanities side of things,

1:27:11.660 --> 1:27:12.820
 I don't know anything about,

1:27:12.820 --> 1:27:15.660
 but the engineering and the science side,

1:27:15.660 --> 1:27:17.740
 I think there's so many amazing ideas

1:27:17.740 --> 1:27:19.780
 that are still coming from universities.

1:27:19.780 --> 1:27:21.220
 It's not true that you don't know anything

1:27:21.220 --> 1:27:22.060
 about the humanities.

1:27:22.060 --> 1:27:24.460
 You're doing the humanities right now.

1:27:24.460 --> 1:27:25.740
 Talking about people,

1:27:25.740 --> 1:27:28.340
 there are no numbers put on a blackboard, right?

1:27:28.340 --> 1:27:30.260
 There's no hypothesis testing per se.

1:27:30.260 --> 1:27:31.100
 No, yeah.

1:27:31.100 --> 1:27:34.580
 You have however many subscribers to your podcast,

1:27:34.580 --> 1:27:37.060
 all listening to you on the humanities.

1:27:37.060 --> 1:27:38.820
 Every, whatever your frequency is.

1:27:38.820 --> 1:27:40.940
 But I'm not in the department of the humanities.

1:27:40.940 --> 1:27:42.420
 That's why it's innovative.

1:27:42.420 --> 1:27:44.900
 They have very different conversations.

1:27:44.900 --> 1:27:48.180
 There's the number of emails I get about,

1:27:48.180 --> 1:27:51.860
 listen, I really deeply respect diversity

1:27:51.860 --> 1:27:56.220
 and the full scope of what diversity means

1:27:56.220 --> 1:27:58.380
 and also the more narrow scope of different races

1:27:58.380 --> 1:27:59.380
 and genders and so on.

1:27:59.380 --> 1:28:01.020
 It's a really important topic,

1:28:01.020 --> 1:28:03.100
 but there's a disproportionate number of emails

1:28:03.100 --> 1:28:05.980
 I'm getting about meetings and discussions

1:28:05.980 --> 1:28:08.540
 and that just kind of is overwhelming.

1:28:08.540 --> 1:28:10.860
 I don't get enough emails from people,

1:28:10.860 --> 1:28:15.980
 like a meeting about why are all your ideas bad?

1:28:15.980 --> 1:28:18.820
 Let's, for example, let me call out MIT.

1:28:18.820 --> 1:28:20.360
 Why don't we do more?

1:28:20.360 --> 1:28:24.280
 Why don't we kick Stanford's ass or Google's ass,

1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:26.600
 more importantly, in deep learning and machine learning

1:28:26.600 --> 1:28:28.240
 and AI research?

1:28:28.240 --> 1:28:31.600
 What CSAIL, for example, used to be a laboratory

1:28:31.600 --> 1:28:35.080
 is a laboratory for artificial intelligence research.

1:28:35.080 --> 1:28:40.080
 And why is that not the beacon of greatness

1:28:42.400 --> 1:28:43.760
 in artificial intelligence?

1:28:43.760 --> 1:28:45.720
 Let's have those meetings as well.

1:28:45.720 --> 1:28:48.920
 Diversity talk has oddly become this new mechanism

1:28:48.920 --> 1:28:50.440
 for enforcing conformity.

1:28:50.440 --> 1:28:51.280
 Yes, exactly.

1:28:51.280 --> 1:28:54.320
 And right, so it's almost like this conformity mechanism

1:28:54.320 --> 1:28:56.800
 finds the hot new topic to use

1:28:56.800 --> 1:28:58.200
 to enforce further conformity.

1:28:58.200 --> 1:28:59.680
 Exactly.

1:28:59.680 --> 1:29:03.480
 Oh boy, I still, I remain optimistic.

1:29:03.480 --> 1:29:05.600
 The humanities have innovated through podcasts,

1:29:05.600 --> 1:29:08.680
 including yours and mine, and they're alive and well.

1:29:08.680 --> 1:29:12.520
 All the bad talk you hear about the humanities

1:29:12.520 --> 1:29:15.120
 in universities, there's been this huge end run

1:29:15.120 --> 1:29:17.640
 of innovation on the internet and it's amazing.

1:29:17.640 --> 1:29:18.480
 You're right.

1:29:18.480 --> 1:29:20.680
 I never thought of, I mean, this is humanities.

1:29:20.680 --> 1:29:23.400
 This podcast is right.

1:29:23.400 --> 1:29:25.040
 It's like you've been speaking prose all one's life

1:29:25.040 --> 1:29:26.440
 and didn't know it, right?

1:29:28.080 --> 1:29:31.000
 Yeah, I am actually part of the humanities department

1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:31.840
 at MIT now.

1:29:31.840 --> 1:29:35.000
 I did not realize this and I will fully embrace it

1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:36.080
 from this moment on.

1:29:36.080 --> 1:29:37.560
 Look, you have this thing, the Media Lab.

1:29:37.560 --> 1:29:39.040
 I'm sure you know about it.

1:29:39.040 --> 1:29:42.400
 Done some excellent things, done a lot of very bogus things,

1:29:42.400 --> 1:29:43.680
 but you're out competing them.

1:29:43.680 --> 1:29:44.960
 You're blowing them out of the water.

1:29:44.960 --> 1:29:45.800
 Yeah.

1:29:45.800 --> 1:29:46.880
 Like you are them.

1:29:46.880 --> 1:29:48.480
 Yeah, I mean, and I'm talking to those folks

1:29:48.480 --> 1:29:50.440
 and they're just trying to, well,

1:29:50.440 --> 1:29:51.480
 they're just trying to figure it out.

1:29:51.480 --> 1:29:53.920
 I mean, they had their issues with Jeff Epstein and so on,

1:29:53.920 --> 1:29:57.840
 but outside of that, there's a,

1:29:57.840 --> 1:29:59.960
 I've actually gone through a shift

1:29:59.960 --> 1:30:02.240
 with this particular podcast, for example,

1:30:02.240 --> 1:30:06.240
 where at first it was seen as a,

1:30:06.240 --> 1:30:09.560
 one, at the very first it was seen as a distraction.

1:30:09.560 --> 1:30:12.000
 Second, it was a source of like,

1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:13.720
 almost like a kind of jealousy,

1:30:13.720 --> 1:30:15.280
 like the same kind of jealousy you feel

1:30:15.280 --> 1:30:18.960
 when junior faculty outshines the senior faculty.

1:30:18.960 --> 1:30:22.240
 And now it's more like, oh, okay, this is a thing.

1:30:22.240 --> 1:30:23.800
 Like we should do more of that.

1:30:23.800 --> 1:30:25.200
 We should embrace this guy.

1:30:25.200 --> 1:30:26.880
 We should embrace this thing.

1:30:26.880 --> 1:30:30.680
 So there's a sense that podcasting and whatever this is,

1:30:30.680 --> 1:30:32.760
 it doesn't have to be podcasting,

1:30:32.760 --> 1:30:35.440
 will drive some innovation within MIT,

1:30:35.440 --> 1:30:37.560
 within different universities.

1:30:37.560 --> 1:30:39.160
 There's a sense that things are changing.

1:30:39.160 --> 1:30:41.800
 It's just that universities lag behind.

1:30:41.800 --> 1:30:45.760
 And my hope is that they catch up quickly.

1:30:45.760 --> 1:30:49.520
 They innovate in some way that goes along

1:30:49.520 --> 1:30:51.840
 with the innovations of the internet.

1:30:51.840 --> 1:30:52.680
 Online.

1:30:52.680 --> 1:30:53.520
 I think the internet will outrace them

1:30:53.520 --> 1:30:55.720
 for a long time, maybe forever.

1:30:55.720 --> 1:30:57.640
 Well, I mean, but it's okay if they're,

1:30:57.640 --> 1:30:58.600
 as long as they're keeping.

1:30:58.600 --> 1:31:00.160
 Yeah, and we're both in universities.

1:31:00.160 --> 1:31:02.680
 So we have multiple hats on here as we're speaking.

1:31:02.680 --> 1:31:05.760
 So we can complain about the universities,

1:31:05.760 --> 1:31:08.760
 but that's like complaining about the podcast, right?

1:31:08.760 --> 1:31:09.600
 We be them.

1:31:09.600 --> 1:31:12.440
 But speaking on the weird,

1:31:12.440 --> 1:31:16.400
 you've in the best sense of the word weird,

1:31:16.400 --> 1:31:18.520
 you've written about and made the case

1:31:18.520 --> 1:31:22.280
 that we should take UFO sightings more seriously.

1:31:22.280 --> 1:31:27.280
 So that's one of the things that I've been inundated with,

1:31:29.920 --> 1:31:34.920
 sort of the excitement and the passion that people have

1:31:36.400 --> 1:31:39.200
 for the possibility of extraterrestrial life,

1:31:39.200 --> 1:31:40.720
 of life out there in the universe.

1:31:40.720 --> 1:31:42.440
 I've always felt this excitement.

1:31:42.440 --> 1:31:43.760
 I was just looking up at the stars

1:31:43.760 --> 1:31:46.160
 and wondering what the hell's out there.

1:31:46.160 --> 1:31:48.840
 But there's people that have more like,

1:31:48.840 --> 1:31:52.160
 more grounded excitement and passion

1:31:52.160 --> 1:31:55.080
 of actually interacting with aliens

1:31:55.080 --> 1:31:57.880
 on this here, our planet.

1:31:57.880 --> 1:32:01.240
 What's the case from your perspective

1:32:01.240 --> 1:32:05.020
 for taking these sightings more seriously?

1:32:05.020 --> 1:32:09.020
 The data from the Navy, to me, seem quite serious.

1:32:09.020 --> 1:32:11.580
 I don't pretend that I have the technical abilities

1:32:11.580 --> 1:32:13.940
 to judge it as data,

1:32:13.940 --> 1:32:16.100
 but there are numerous senators

1:32:16.100 --> 1:32:18.220
 at the very highest of levels,

1:32:18.220 --> 1:32:20.180
 former heads of CIA, Brennan.

1:32:20.180 --> 1:32:22.540
 I talked to him, did an interview with him.

1:32:22.540 --> 1:32:24.580
 I asked him, what's up with these?

1:32:24.580 --> 1:32:25.420
 What do you think it is?

1:32:25.420 --> 1:32:28.740
 He basically said that was the single most likely explanation

1:32:28.740 --> 1:32:30.020
 was of alien origin.

1:32:30.020 --> 1:32:32.340
 Now you don't have to agree with him.

1:32:32.340 --> 1:32:35.180
 But look, if you know how government works, these senators,

1:32:35.180 --> 1:32:37.700
 or Hillary Clinton, for that matter, or Brennan,

1:32:37.700 --> 1:32:40.380
 they sat down, they were briefed by their smartest people,

1:32:40.380 --> 1:32:43.900
 and they said, hey, what's going on here?

1:32:43.900 --> 1:32:45.580
 And everyone around the table, I believe,

1:32:45.580 --> 1:32:48.180
 is telling them, we don't know.

1:32:48.180 --> 1:32:52.660
 And that is sociological data I take very seriously.

1:32:52.660 --> 1:32:56.460
 I have not seen a debunking of the technical data,

1:32:56.460 --> 1:32:59.060
 which is eyewitness reports and images and radar.

1:32:59.060 --> 1:33:02.020
 Again, I don't pretend that I have the technical abilities

1:33:02.020 --> 1:33:03.860
 or again, at a technical level,

1:33:03.860 --> 1:33:06.660
 I feel quite uncertain on that turf.

1:33:06.660 --> 1:33:10.020
 But evaluating through the testimony of witnesses,

1:33:10.020 --> 1:33:12.660
 it seems to me it's now at a threshold

1:33:12.660 --> 1:33:15.140
 where one ought to take it seriously.

1:33:15.140 --> 1:33:18.500
 Yeah, one of the problems with UFO sightings

1:33:18.500 --> 1:33:21.020
 is that because of people with good equipment

1:33:21.940 --> 1:33:25.140
 don't take it seriously, it's such a taboo topic,

1:33:25.140 --> 1:33:28.100
 that you have just like really shitty equipment

1:33:28.100 --> 1:33:28.940
 collecting data.

1:33:28.940 --> 1:33:32.460
 And so you have the blurry Bigfoot kind of situation

1:33:32.460 --> 1:33:35.700
 where you have just bad video and all those kinds of things.

1:33:35.700 --> 1:33:40.180
 As opposed to, I mean, there's a bunch of people,

1:33:41.180 --> 1:33:44.860
 Avi Lo from Harvard talking about Oumuamua.

1:33:44.860 --> 1:33:49.660
 It's just like people with the equipment

1:33:49.660 --> 1:33:54.220
 to do the data collection don't want to help out.

1:33:54.220 --> 1:33:57.820
 And that creates a kind of divide

1:33:57.820 --> 1:34:00.740
 where the scientists ignore that this is happening

1:34:00.740 --> 1:34:04.100
 and there's the masses of people who are curious about it.

1:34:04.100 --> 1:34:07.020
 And then there's the government that's full of secrets

1:34:07.020 --> 1:34:10.780
 that's leaking some confusion

1:34:10.780 --> 1:34:12.820
 and it creates distrust in the government,

1:34:12.820 --> 1:34:15.260
 it creates distrust in science

1:34:15.260 --> 1:34:16.980
 and it prevents the scientists

1:34:16.980 --> 1:34:19.860
 from being able to explore some cool topics,

1:34:19.860 --> 1:34:22.780
 some exciting possibilities that they should be,

1:34:22.780 --> 1:34:25.340
 be curious kids like Avi talks about.

1:34:25.340 --> 1:34:28.540
 Even if it has nothing to do with aliens,

1:34:28.540 --> 1:34:31.220
 whatever the answer is, it has to be something fascinating.

1:34:31.220 --> 1:34:32.620
 We already know everything's interesting,

1:34:32.620 --> 1:34:33.820
 but this is fascinating.

1:34:36.020 --> 1:34:37.020
 But look, that all said,

1:34:37.020 --> 1:34:39.060
 I suspect they're not of alien origin.

1:34:39.060 --> 1:34:40.380
 And let me tell you my reason.

1:34:40.380 --> 1:34:43.220
 The people who are all gung ho,

1:34:43.220 --> 1:34:45.220
 they do a kind of reasoning in reverse

1:34:45.220 --> 1:34:46.780
 or argument from elimination.

1:34:47.740 --> 1:34:49.900
 They figure out a bunch of things that can't be,

1:34:49.900 --> 1:34:52.340
 like is it a Russian advanced vehicle?

1:34:52.340 --> 1:34:54.580
 No, probably pretty good arguments there.

1:34:54.580 --> 1:34:56.340
 Is it a Chinese advanced vehicle?

1:34:56.340 --> 1:34:57.300
 No.

1:34:57.300 --> 1:35:00.180
 Is it people like from the earth's future

1:35:00.180 --> 1:35:01.500
 coming back in time?

1:35:01.500 --> 1:35:02.340
 No.

1:35:02.340 --> 1:35:03.620
 And they go through a few others.

1:35:03.620 --> 1:35:05.020
 They have some really good no arguments.

1:35:05.020 --> 1:35:07.980
 Then they're like, well, what we've got left is aliens.

1:35:07.980 --> 1:35:09.700
 This argument from elimination,

1:35:09.700 --> 1:35:12.500
 I don't actually find that persuasive.

1:35:12.500 --> 1:35:16.060
 You can talk yourself into a lot of mistaken ideas that way.

1:35:16.060 --> 1:35:20.500
 The positive evidence that it's aliens is still quite weak.

1:35:20.500 --> 1:35:24.100
 The positive evidence that it's a puzzle is quite huge.

1:35:24.100 --> 1:35:27.180
 And whatever the solution to the puzzle is,

1:35:27.180 --> 1:35:28.500
 it might be fascinating.

1:35:28.500 --> 1:35:30.580
 And it's gonna be so weird or fascinating

1:35:30.580 --> 1:35:33.540
 or maybe even trivial, but that's weird in its own way,

1:35:33.540 --> 1:35:37.060
 that we can't set up by elimination

1:35:37.060 --> 1:35:38.700
 all the things that might be able to be.

1:35:38.700 --> 1:35:39.980
 Yeah, and just like you said,

1:35:39.980 --> 1:35:43.820
 the debunking that I've seen of these kinds of things

1:35:43.820 --> 1:35:48.820
 are less explorations and solutions to the puzzle

1:35:49.380 --> 1:35:52.820
 and more a kind of halfhearted dismissal.

1:35:52.820 --> 1:35:56.620
 And Avi, as you mentioned to him on your podcast with him,

1:35:56.620 --> 1:35:58.820
 he's been attacked an awful lot.

1:35:58.820 --> 1:36:01.300
 And when I hear the idea carrier attacked,

1:36:01.300 --> 1:36:03.180
 I get very suspicious of the critics.

1:36:04.620 --> 1:36:07.220
 If he's wrong, like just tell me why.

1:36:07.220 --> 1:36:08.940
 Like my ears are open.

1:36:08.940 --> 1:36:12.460
 I don't have a set view on Oumuamua, you know.

1:36:12.460 --> 1:36:14.460
 I know I can't judge Avi's arguments.

1:36:14.460 --> 1:36:15.980
 He can't convince me in that sense.

1:36:15.980 --> 1:36:18.180
 I'm too stupid to understand

1:36:18.180 --> 1:36:20.740
 how good his argument may or may not be.

1:36:20.740 --> 1:36:23.140
 And like you said, ultimately,

1:36:23.140 --> 1:36:27.980
 in the argument, in the meeting of that debate

1:36:27.980 --> 1:36:30.580
 is where we find the wisdom.

1:36:30.580 --> 1:36:32.180
 Like dismissing it, there's one other thing

1:36:32.180 --> 1:36:33.020
 that troubles me.

1:36:33.020 --> 1:36:33.860
 There's a bunch of people,

1:36:33.860 --> 1:36:35.500
 like Nietzsche sometimes dismiss this way.

1:36:35.500 --> 1:36:38.100
 Ayn Rand is sometimes dismissed this way.

1:36:38.100 --> 1:36:38.940
 Oh, here we go.

1:36:38.940 --> 1:36:43.100
 Like there's a, as opposed to arguing against her ideas,

1:36:43.100 --> 1:36:44.900
 dismissing it outright.

1:36:44.900 --> 1:36:48.340
 And that's not productive at all.

1:36:48.340 --> 1:36:49.780
 She may be wrong on a lot of things,

1:36:49.780 --> 1:36:52.900
 but like laying out some arguments,

1:36:52.900 --> 1:36:54.820
 even if they're basic human arguments,

1:36:55.740 --> 1:36:57.980
 that's where we arrive at the wisdom.

1:36:57.980 --> 1:36:58.820
 I love that.

1:36:59.820 --> 1:37:03.300
 Is there something deeper to be said

1:37:03.300 --> 1:37:06.740
 about our trust in institutions and governments and so on

1:37:06.740 --> 1:37:08.940
 that has to do with UFOs?

1:37:08.940 --> 1:37:10.980
 That there's a kind of suspicion

1:37:10.980 --> 1:37:13.580
 that the US government and governments in general

1:37:13.580 --> 1:37:17.340
 are hiding stuff from us when you talk about UFOs.

1:37:17.340 --> 1:37:18.900
 This is my view on that.

1:37:18.900 --> 1:37:20.940
 If we declassified everything,

1:37:20.940 --> 1:37:22.900
 I think we would find a lot more evidence

1:37:22.900 --> 1:37:25.260
 all pointing toward the same puzzle.

1:37:25.260 --> 1:37:28.180
 There aren't some alien men being held underground.

1:37:28.180 --> 1:37:30.100
 There's not some secret file that lays out

1:37:30.100 --> 1:37:31.300
 whatever is happening.

1:37:32.220 --> 1:37:34.420
 I think the real lesson about government

1:37:34.420 --> 1:37:38.460
 is government cannot bring itself to any new belief

1:37:38.460 --> 1:37:40.580
 on this matter of any kind.

1:37:40.580 --> 1:37:42.300
 And it's a kind of funny inertia.

1:37:42.300 --> 1:37:44.300
 Like government is deeply puzzled.

1:37:44.300 --> 1:37:46.540
 They're more puzzled than they want to admit to us,

1:37:46.540 --> 1:37:49.740
 which I'm okay with that, actually.

1:37:49.740 --> 1:37:53.140
 They shouldn't just be out panicking people in the streets.

1:37:53.140 --> 1:37:54.180
 But at the end of the day,

1:37:54.180 --> 1:37:57.220
 it's a bit like approving the AstraZeneca vaccine,

1:37:57.220 --> 1:37:59.060
 which does work and they haven't approved it.

1:37:59.060 --> 1:38:00.380
 When are they gonna do it?

1:38:00.380 --> 1:38:05.380
 When is our government actually, if only internally,

1:38:06.140 --> 1:38:08.220
 gonna take this more than just seriously,

1:38:08.220 --> 1:38:10.380
 but take it truly seriously?

1:38:10.380 --> 1:38:13.060
 And I just don't know if we have that capability,

1:38:13.060 --> 1:38:15.820
 kind of mentally, to sound like Eric Weinstein

1:38:15.820 --> 1:38:17.500
 for another moment.

1:38:17.500 --> 1:38:21.620
 And to stay on the same topic,

1:38:21.620 --> 1:38:23.820
 although on the surface shifting completely,

1:38:25.100 --> 1:38:26.980
 because it is all the same topic.

1:38:26.980 --> 1:38:29.620
 You have written and studied art.

1:38:29.620 --> 1:38:34.620
 Why do you think we humans long to create art,

1:38:34.740 --> 1:38:38.020
 human society in general and just the human mind?

1:38:38.020 --> 1:38:41.180
 Well, most of us don't really long to create art, right?

1:38:41.180 --> 1:38:42.940
 I would start with that point.

1:38:43.860 --> 1:38:45.100
 You think so?

1:38:45.100 --> 1:38:47.740
 You think that's a unique weirdness

1:38:47.740 --> 1:38:49.940
 of some particular humans?

1:38:49.940 --> 1:38:52.900
 I think, I don't know, 10% of humans roughly,

1:38:52.900 --> 1:38:55.820
 which is a lot, but it is somewhat weird.

1:38:56.780 --> 1:38:58.860
 I don't aspire to create art.

1:38:58.860 --> 1:39:01.660
 You could say, like writing nonfiction,

1:39:01.660 --> 1:39:03.460
 there's something art like about it,

1:39:03.460 --> 1:39:05.700
 but it's a different urge, I would say.

1:39:07.980 --> 1:39:10.780
 So why do some people have it?

1:39:10.780 --> 1:39:13.180
 I think human brains are very different.

1:39:13.180 --> 1:39:16.260
 It's a different notion of working through a problem.

1:39:16.260 --> 1:39:20.220
 Like you and I enjoy working through analytic problems.

1:39:20.220 --> 1:39:22.620
 For me, economics, for you, AI and other areas,

1:39:22.620 --> 1:39:26.860
 or your humanities podcast, but that's fun.

1:39:26.860 --> 1:39:29.260
 For that problem to be visual

1:39:29.260 --> 1:39:31.220
 and linked to physical materials

1:39:31.220 --> 1:39:33.140
 and putting those like on a canvas,

1:39:34.300 --> 1:39:36.260
 to me, it's not a huge leap,

1:39:36.260 --> 1:39:38.740
 but I really don't wanna do it.

1:39:38.740 --> 1:39:40.100
 Like it would be pain.

1:39:40.100 --> 1:39:45.100
 If you paid me like 500 bucks to spend an hour painting,

1:39:45.540 --> 1:39:48.140
 I don't know, is that worth it?

1:39:48.140 --> 1:39:51.380
 Maybe, but like, I'm happy when that hour's over.

1:39:53.100 --> 1:39:55.540
 And would not be proud or happy with the result.

1:39:55.540 --> 1:39:57.140
 It would suck.

1:39:57.140 --> 1:39:59.740
 I don't think I would do it actually.

1:39:59.740 --> 1:40:02.940
 Do you think you're suppressing some deep, I mean?

1:40:02.940 --> 1:40:03.860
 Absolutely not.

1:40:03.860 --> 1:40:06.780
 Now, when I was young, I played the guitar

1:40:06.780 --> 1:40:09.020
 as you played the guitar and that I greatly enjoyed,

1:40:09.020 --> 1:40:11.060
 although I was never good,

1:40:11.060 --> 1:40:14.380
 but it helped me appreciate music much, much more.

1:40:14.380 --> 1:40:15.220
 Well, this is the question.

1:40:15.220 --> 1:40:17.020
 Okay, so from the perspective of the observer

1:40:17.020 --> 1:40:20.300
 and appreciator of art, you said good.

1:40:20.300 --> 1:40:23.500
 Is there such a concept as good in art?

1:40:23.500 --> 1:40:25.860
 There's clearly a concept of bad.

1:40:25.860 --> 1:40:27.940
 My guitar playing fit that concept.

1:40:29.100 --> 1:40:29.940
 Okay.

1:40:29.940 --> 1:40:30.780
 But I wasn't trying to be good.

1:40:30.780 --> 1:40:33.100
 I wanted to learn like how do chords work?

1:40:33.100 --> 1:40:33.940
 Okay, analytical.

1:40:33.940 --> 1:40:35.620
 How does a jazz improvisation work?

1:40:35.620 --> 1:40:37.340
 How is blues different?

1:40:37.340 --> 1:40:39.380
 Classical guitar, sort of physically,

1:40:39.380 --> 1:40:41.100
 how do you make those sounds?

1:40:41.100 --> 1:40:42.340
 And I did learn those things.

1:40:42.340 --> 1:40:44.780
 And you can't learn everything about them,

1:40:44.780 --> 1:40:47.100
 but you can learn a lot about them without ever being good

1:40:47.100 --> 1:40:48.700
 or even trying to be that good.

1:40:48.700 --> 1:40:51.020
 But I could play all the notes.

1:40:51.020 --> 1:40:53.140
 So from the observer perspective,

1:40:53.140 --> 1:40:56.980
 what do you, I apologize for the absurd question,

1:40:56.980 --> 1:40:58.740
 but what do you use the most beautiful

1:40:58.740 --> 1:41:02.140
 and maybe moving piece of art you've encountered

1:41:02.140 --> 1:41:02.980
 in your life?

1:41:02.980 --> 1:41:05.780
 It's not an absurd question at all.

1:41:05.780 --> 1:41:07.540
 And I think about this quite a bit.

1:41:09.140 --> 1:41:13.060
 I would say the two winners by a clear margin

1:41:13.060 --> 1:41:15.140
 are both by Michelangelo.

1:41:15.140 --> 1:41:17.620
 It's the Pieta in the Vatican

1:41:17.620 --> 1:41:20.780
 and the David statue in Florence.

1:41:20.780 --> 1:41:21.620
 Why?

1:41:21.620 --> 1:41:25.340
 Historical context or just purity, the creation itself?

1:41:25.340 --> 1:41:28.060
 I don't think you can view it apart from historical context

1:41:28.060 --> 1:41:30.820
 and being in Florence or in the Vatican,

1:41:30.820 --> 1:41:32.780
 you're already primed for a lot, right?

1:41:32.780 --> 1:41:35.460
 You can't pull that out.

1:41:35.460 --> 1:41:37.780
 But just technically how they express

1:41:37.780 --> 1:41:40.060
 the emotion of human form,

1:41:40.060 --> 1:41:42.180
 I do honestly intellectually think

1:41:42.180 --> 1:41:45.220
 they're the two greatest artworks for doing that.

1:41:45.220 --> 1:41:46.500
 That's not all that art does.

1:41:46.500 --> 1:41:48.620
 Not all art is about the human form,

1:41:48.620 --> 1:41:50.020
 but they are phenomenal.

1:41:51.140 --> 1:41:54.300
 And I think critical opinion, not that everyone agrees,

1:41:54.300 --> 1:41:57.300
 but my view is not considered a crazy one

1:41:57.300 --> 1:41:58.940
 within the broader court of critical opinion.

1:41:58.940 --> 1:42:02.820
 Now in painting, I think the most I was ever blown away

1:42:02.820 --> 1:42:05.420
 was to see Vermeer's artwork.

1:42:05.420 --> 1:42:09.020
 It's called The Art of Painting and it's in Vienna

1:42:09.020 --> 1:42:11.300
 in the Kunsthistorisches Museum.

1:42:11.300 --> 1:42:13.340
 And I saw that, I think I was 23.

1:42:15.260 --> 1:42:17.940
 It just stunned me because I'd seen reproductions,

1:42:17.940 --> 1:42:19.540
 but live in front of you in huge,

1:42:19.540 --> 1:42:21.020
 a completely different artwork.

1:42:21.020 --> 1:42:23.460
 And again, Vienna, primed.

1:42:23.460 --> 1:42:26.820
 Yes, and I was living abroad for the first time

1:42:26.820 --> 1:42:28.740
 and Vienna itself, the city and so on.

1:42:28.740 --> 1:42:30.300
 Now, unlike the Michelangelo's,

1:42:30.300 --> 1:42:33.060
 that is not my current favorite painting,

1:42:33.060 --> 1:42:35.500
 but that would be like historically the one I would pick.

1:42:35.500 --> 1:42:38.060
 What do you make in the context of those choices?

1:42:38.060 --> 1:42:39.700
 What do you make of modern art?

1:42:39.700 --> 1:42:44.660
 And I apologize if I'm not using the correct terminology,

1:42:44.660 --> 1:42:49.660
 but art that maybe goes another level of weird

1:42:50.500 --> 1:42:52.940
 outside of the art that you've kind of mentioned

1:42:52.940 --> 1:42:55.700
 and breaks all the conventions and rules and so on

1:42:55.700 --> 1:42:59.420
 and becomes something else entirely

1:42:59.420 --> 1:43:02.620
 that doesn't make sense in the same way

1:43:02.620 --> 1:43:03.860
 that David might.

1:43:03.860 --> 1:43:05.660
 I think a lot of it is phenomenal.

1:43:05.660 --> 1:43:07.740
 And I would say the single biggest mistake

1:43:07.740 --> 1:43:12.300
 that really smart people make is to think contemporary art

1:43:12.300 --> 1:43:15.980
 or music for that matter is just a load of junk or rubbish.

1:43:15.980 --> 1:43:17.580
 It's just like a kind of mathematics

1:43:17.580 --> 1:43:18.780
 they haven't learned yet.

1:43:18.780 --> 1:43:20.620
 It's really hard to learn.

1:43:20.620 --> 1:43:23.260
 Maybe some people can never learn it,

1:43:23.260 --> 1:43:26.220
 but there's a very large community of super smart,

1:43:26.220 --> 1:43:28.820
 well educated people who spend their lives with it,

1:43:28.820 --> 1:43:29.700
 who love it.

1:43:29.700 --> 1:43:30.900
 Those are genuine pleasures.

1:43:30.900 --> 1:43:31.740
 They understand it.

1:43:31.740 --> 1:43:34.260
 They talk about it with the common language.

1:43:34.260 --> 1:43:36.100
 And to think that somehow they're all frauds,

1:43:36.100 --> 1:43:37.500
 it just isn't true.

1:43:37.500 --> 1:43:40.100
 Like one doesn't have to like it oneself,

1:43:40.100 --> 1:43:42.340
 just like Love House may or may not be your thing,

1:43:42.340 --> 1:43:45.820
 but it is amazing and for me personally, highly rewarding.

1:43:45.820 --> 1:43:47.980
 And if someone doesn't get it,

1:43:47.980 --> 1:43:50.420
 I do kind of have the conceited response of thinking

1:43:50.420 --> 1:43:54.060
 like in that area, I'm just smarter than you are.

1:43:54.060 --> 1:43:56.860
 Yeah, so the interesting thing is as with most...

1:43:56.860 --> 1:43:58.580
 We get back to Eric Weinstein again.

1:43:58.580 --> 1:43:59.420
 Yes.

1:43:59.420 --> 1:44:02.180
 He's in general smarter than I am, this I get.

1:44:02.180 --> 1:44:05.060
 But when it comes to contemporary artistic creations,

1:44:05.060 --> 1:44:06.700
 I'm smarter than he is.

1:44:06.700 --> 1:44:08.780
 So he's not a fan of contemporary art?

1:44:08.780 --> 1:44:10.180
 I don't want to speak for him.

1:44:10.180 --> 1:44:11.500
 I've heard him say derogatory...

1:44:11.500 --> 1:44:12.660
 He's evolving always.

1:44:12.660 --> 1:44:13.780
 He's evolving always.

1:44:13.780 --> 1:44:16.180
 I've heard him say derogatory things about some of it.

1:44:16.180 --> 1:44:18.740
 Doesn't mean he doesn't love some other parts of it.

1:44:18.740 --> 1:44:22.340
 So I wonder if there's just a higher learning curve,

1:44:22.340 --> 1:44:24.820
 a steeper learning curve for contemporary art,

1:44:24.820 --> 1:44:28.660
 meaning like it takes more work to appreciate the stories,

1:44:28.660 --> 1:44:32.420
 the context from which they're like thinking about this work.

1:44:32.420 --> 1:44:36.180
 It feels like in order to appreciate the art contemporary,

1:44:36.180 --> 1:44:37.660
 certain pieces of contemporary art,

1:44:37.660 --> 1:44:41.260
 you have to know the story better behind the art.

1:44:41.260 --> 1:44:42.860
 I think that's true for many people,

1:44:42.860 --> 1:44:45.420
 but I think it's a funny shape distribution

1:44:45.420 --> 1:44:47.780
 because there's a whole other set of people.

1:44:47.780 --> 1:44:49.460
 Sometimes they're small children

1:44:49.460 --> 1:44:51.740
 and they get abstract art more easily.

1:44:51.740 --> 1:44:56.380
 You show them Vermeer or Rembrandt, they don't get it.

1:44:56.380 --> 1:45:00.340
 But just like a wall of color, they're in love with it.

1:45:00.340 --> 1:45:03.100
 So I don't think I know the full story.

1:45:03.100 --> 1:45:04.740
 Again, some strange kind of distribution.

1:45:04.740 --> 1:45:07.820
 The entry barriers are super high or super low,

1:45:07.820 --> 1:45:09.300
 but not that often in between.

1:45:11.100 --> 1:45:12.780
 But you would challenge saying

1:45:12.780 --> 1:45:15.420
 that there's a lot to be explored in contemporary art.

1:45:15.420 --> 1:45:20.420
 It's just you need to learn.

1:45:20.420 --> 1:45:22.380
 Yeah, it's one of the most profound bodies

1:45:22.380 --> 1:45:24.060
 of human thought out there.

1:45:24.060 --> 1:45:26.460
 And it's part of the humanities.

1:45:26.460 --> 1:45:28.540
 And yes, there are people who also don't like podcasts,

1:45:28.540 --> 1:45:29.380
 right?

1:45:30.540 --> 1:45:31.380
 And that's fine.

1:45:31.380 --> 1:45:32.540
 Yeah.

1:45:32.540 --> 1:45:35.500
 You've also been a scholar of food.

1:45:35.500 --> 1:45:37.060
 We're just going through the entirety

1:45:37.060 --> 1:45:40.020
 of the human experience today on this humanities podcast.

1:45:42.620 --> 1:45:45.460
 Another absurd question, say this conversation

1:45:45.460 --> 1:45:47.100
 is the last thing you ever do in your life.

1:45:47.100 --> 1:45:49.460
 I, wearing the suit, would murder you

1:45:49.460 --> 1:45:50.660
 at the end of the conversation.

1:45:50.660 --> 1:45:52.660
 So this is your last day on earth,

1:45:52.660 --> 1:45:54.540
 but I would offer you a last meal.

1:45:54.540 --> 1:45:57.220
 What would that meal contain?

1:45:57.220 --> 1:45:59.340
 We can also travel to other parts of the world.

1:45:59.340 --> 1:46:00.340
 Well, we have to travel

1:46:00.340 --> 1:46:03.420
 because my preferred last meal here,

1:46:03.420 --> 1:46:05.820
 I probably had like two nights ago.

1:46:05.820 --> 1:46:06.900
 Which is what?

1:46:06.900 --> 1:46:08.580
 Can you describe or no?

1:46:08.580 --> 1:46:11.300
 The best restaurant around here is called Mama Chang's

1:46:11.300 --> 1:46:16.100
 and it's in Fairfax and it's food from Wuhan actually.

1:46:16.100 --> 1:46:18.420
 And they take pandemic safety seriously

1:46:18.420 --> 1:46:20.420
 in addition to the food being very good.

1:46:20.420 --> 1:46:23.060
 But this is what I would do.

1:46:23.060 --> 1:46:27.460
 I would fly to Hermosillo in Northern Mexico,

1:46:27.460 --> 1:46:29.180
 which has some of the best food in Mexico,

1:46:29.180 --> 1:46:31.980
 but I sadly only had two days there.

1:46:31.980 --> 1:46:33.780
 So somewhere like Oaxaca, Puebla,

1:46:35.020 --> 1:46:37.500
 I think they have food just as good

1:46:37.500 --> 1:46:38.820
 or some people would say better,

1:46:38.820 --> 1:46:41.220
 but I've spent a lot of time in those places.

1:46:41.220 --> 1:46:44.340
 So the scarce, wait, is it possible the scarcity of time

1:46:44.340 --> 1:46:46.660
 contributed to the richness of the experience?

1:46:46.660 --> 1:46:50.020
 Of course, but the point is that scarcity still holds.

1:46:50.020 --> 1:46:53.380
 So I want one more dose of the food from Hermosillo.

1:46:53.380 --> 1:46:55.620
 Can you describe what the food is?

1:46:55.620 --> 1:46:58.180
 It's the one kind of Mexican food that at least nominally

1:46:58.180 --> 1:47:00.740
 is just like the Mexican food you get in the US.

1:47:00.740 --> 1:47:02.860
 So there are burritos, there's fajitas.

1:47:02.860 --> 1:47:05.420
 It doesn't taste at all like our stuff.

1:47:05.420 --> 1:47:08.180
 But again, nominally, it's the part of Mexican food

1:47:08.180 --> 1:47:11.380
 that made it into the US was then transformed.

1:47:11.380 --> 1:47:13.300
 But it's in a way the most familiar.

1:47:14.420 --> 1:47:16.220
 But for that reason, it's the most radical

1:47:16.220 --> 1:47:18.700
 because you have to rethink all these things you know

1:47:18.700 --> 1:47:21.140
 and they're way better in Hermosillo.

1:47:21.140 --> 1:47:22.580
 Hardly any tourists go there.

1:47:22.580 --> 1:47:24.860
 Like there's nothing to see in Hermosillo.

1:47:24.860 --> 1:47:26.820
 Nothing you do other than eat.

1:47:26.820 --> 1:47:29.340
 It's not ruined by any outsiders.

1:47:29.340 --> 1:47:33.060
 It's this longstanding tradition, dirt cheap.

1:47:33.060 --> 1:47:36.340
 And the thing to do there is just sweet talk a taxi driver

1:47:36.340 --> 1:47:38.580
 into first taking you seriously

1:47:38.580 --> 1:47:41.900
 and then trusting you enough to know that you trust him

1:47:41.900 --> 1:47:44.820
 to bring you to the very best like food stands.

1:47:44.820 --> 1:47:49.820
 So where's the magic of that nominally similar

1:47:51.900 --> 1:47:53.500
 entity of the burrito?

1:47:53.500 --> 1:47:55.220
 Where's the magic come from?

1:47:55.220 --> 1:47:56.780
 Is it the taxi ride?

1:47:56.780 --> 1:47:57.980
 Is it the whole experience

1:47:57.980 --> 1:47:59.940
 or is there something actually in the food?

1:47:59.940 --> 1:48:02.340
 So well, you can break the food down part by part.

1:48:02.340 --> 1:48:04.020
 So if you think of the beef,

1:48:04.020 --> 1:48:07.500
 the beef there will be dry aged just out in the air

1:48:07.500 --> 1:48:10.660
 in a way the FDA here would never permit.

1:48:10.660 --> 1:48:12.540
 Like they dry age it till it turns green,

1:48:12.540 --> 1:48:14.460
 but it is phenomenal.

1:48:14.460 --> 1:48:16.380
 The quality of the chilies.

1:48:16.380 --> 1:48:17.820
 So here there's only a small number

1:48:17.820 --> 1:48:19.740
 of kinds of chilies you can get.

1:48:19.740 --> 1:48:21.700
 In most parts of Mexico,

1:48:21.700 --> 1:48:24.220
 there's quite a large number of chilies you can get.

1:48:24.220 --> 1:48:26.140
 They're different, they're fresher,

1:48:26.140 --> 1:48:27.980
 but it's just like a different thing.

1:48:27.980 --> 1:48:32.260
 The chilies, the wheat used.

1:48:32.260 --> 1:48:34.740
 So this is wheat territory, not corn territory,

1:48:34.740 --> 1:48:36.140
 which is a self interesting.

1:48:37.460 --> 1:48:39.740
 The wheat is more diverse and more complex.

1:48:39.740 --> 1:48:42.300
 Here it's more homogenized, obviously cheaper,

1:48:42.300 --> 1:48:44.740
 more efficient, but there it is better.

1:48:45.860 --> 1:48:50.220
 Non pasteurized cheeses are legal in all parts of Mexico

1:48:50.220 --> 1:48:52.900
 and they can be white and gooey and amazing

1:48:52.900 --> 1:48:55.660
 in a way that here again, it's just against the law.

1:48:55.660 --> 1:48:56.620
 You could legalize them.

1:48:56.620 --> 1:48:57.780
 The demand wouldn't be that great.

1:48:57.780 --> 1:48:59.300
 There's a black market in these cheeses

1:48:59.300 --> 1:49:01.620
 that Latino groceries around here,

1:49:01.620 --> 1:49:03.420
 but you just can't get that much of it.

1:49:03.420 --> 1:49:05.660
 So the cheese, the meat, the wheat,

1:49:06.660 --> 1:49:09.300
 all different in significant ways.

1:49:09.300 --> 1:49:13.100
 The chilies, I don't think the onions really matter much.

1:49:13.100 --> 1:49:14.060
 Garlic, I don't know.

1:49:14.060 --> 1:49:15.820
 I wouldn't put much stock in that,

1:49:16.700 --> 1:49:18.700
 but that's a lot of the core food

1:49:18.700 --> 1:49:20.020
 and then it's cooked much better

1:49:20.020 --> 1:49:21.460
 and everything's super fresh.

1:49:22.340 --> 1:49:25.300
 The food chain is not relying on refrigeration.

1:49:25.300 --> 1:49:27.740
 And this is one thing Russia and US have in common.

1:49:28.660 --> 1:49:31.540
 We were early pioneers in food refrigeration

1:49:31.540 --> 1:49:34.260
 and that made a lot of our foods worse quite early.

1:49:34.260 --> 1:49:37.260
 And it took us a long time to dig out of that

1:49:37.260 --> 1:49:39.380
 because big countries, right?

1:49:39.380 --> 1:49:42.420
 You've had an extensive rail system in Russia,

1:49:42.420 --> 1:49:45.740
 USSR a long time, which makes it easier to freeze

1:49:45.740 --> 1:49:46.580
 and then ship.

1:49:47.580 --> 1:49:50.580
 What about the actual cooking, the chef?

1:49:50.580 --> 1:49:53.780
 Is there an artistry to the simple?

1:49:53.780 --> 1:49:57.060
 I hesitate to call the burrito simple, but.

1:49:57.060 --> 1:49:58.740
 And there's no brain drain out of cooking.

1:49:58.740 --> 1:50:03.460
 So if you're in the United States and you're very talented,

1:50:03.460 --> 1:50:05.260
 I'm not saying there aren't talented chefs.

1:50:05.260 --> 1:50:06.780
 Of course there are,

1:50:06.780 --> 1:50:09.620
 but there's so many other things to pull people away.

1:50:09.620 --> 1:50:12.300
 But in Mexico, there's so much talent going into food

1:50:12.300 --> 1:50:14.100
 as there is in China,

1:50:14.100 --> 1:50:17.460
 which would be another candidate for last meal questions.

1:50:17.460 --> 1:50:18.500
 Or India.

1:50:18.500 --> 1:50:21.340
 Or, oh, India, let's not even get started on India.

1:50:21.340 --> 1:50:22.180
 Unbelievable.

1:50:23.220 --> 1:50:24.740
 You've also, I mean, there's a million things

1:50:24.740 --> 1:50:25.580
 we could talk about here,

1:50:25.580 --> 1:50:28.700
 but you've written about your own dreams of sushi.

1:50:28.700 --> 1:50:30.620
 It's just a really clean, good example

1:50:30.620 --> 1:50:33.700
 that people are aware of of mastery

1:50:33.700 --> 1:50:38.180
 in the art of the simple in food.

1:50:39.420 --> 1:50:41.460
 What do you make of that kind of obsessive pursuit

1:50:41.460 --> 1:50:45.020
 of perfection in creating simple food?

1:50:45.020 --> 1:50:46.780
 Sushi is about perfection,

1:50:46.780 --> 1:50:48.420
 but it's a bit like the Beatles White album,

1:50:48.420 --> 1:50:51.540
 which people think is simple and not overproduced.

1:50:51.540 --> 1:50:54.340
 It's in a funny way their most overproduced album,

1:50:54.340 --> 1:50:55.980
 but it's produced just perfectly.

1:50:55.980 --> 1:50:57.260
 It sounds simple.

1:50:57.260 --> 1:50:59.860
 It's really hard to produce music to the point

1:50:59.860 --> 1:51:03.140
 where it's gonna sound so simple and not sound like sludge.

1:51:03.140 --> 1:51:06.140
 Like Let It Be album, it has some great songs,

1:51:06.140 --> 1:51:07.700
 but a lot of it sounds like sludge.

1:51:07.700 --> 1:51:09.780
 One After 909, that's sludge.

1:51:09.780 --> 1:51:11.580
 I Dig A Pony, it's sludge.

1:51:11.580 --> 1:51:13.020
 Like it's a bit interesting.

1:51:13.020 --> 1:51:13.860
 It's not that good.

1:51:13.860 --> 1:51:15.740
 It doesn't sound that good.

1:51:15.740 --> 1:51:18.140
 White album, like the best half, like Dear Prudence,

1:51:18.140 --> 1:51:20.020
 sounds perfect, sounds simple.

1:51:20.020 --> 1:51:21.940
 Cry Baby Cry, it's not simple.

1:51:21.940 --> 1:51:25.180
 Back in the USSR, super complex.

1:51:25.180 --> 1:51:26.900
 So sushi is like that.

1:51:26.900 --> 1:51:29.580
 It's because it's so incredibly not simple

1:51:29.580 --> 1:51:31.540
 starting with the rice.

1:51:31.540 --> 1:51:34.420
 You try to refine it to make it appear super simple,

1:51:34.420 --> 1:51:37.020
 and that's the most complex thing of all.

1:51:37.020 --> 1:51:39.300
 So do you admire,

1:51:39.300 --> 1:51:43.900
 I mean, we're not talking about days, weeks, months.

1:51:43.900 --> 1:51:46.540
 We're talking about years, generations

1:51:46.540 --> 1:51:49.260
 of doing the same thing over and over and over again.

1:51:49.260 --> 1:51:51.460
 Do you admire that kind of sticking to the,

1:51:53.020 --> 1:51:56.060
 we talked about our admiration of the weird.

1:51:56.060 --> 1:51:57.540
 That doesn't feel weird.

1:51:57.540 --> 1:52:01.420
 That seems like discipline and dedication

1:52:01.420 --> 1:52:05.300
 to like a stoic minimalism or something like that.

1:52:05.300 --> 1:52:07.940
 I'm happy they do it, but I actually feel bad about it.

1:52:07.940 --> 1:52:10.860
 I feel they're sacrificial victims to me,

1:52:10.860 --> 1:52:12.620
 which I benefit from.

1:52:12.620 --> 1:52:13.740
 But don't you ever think like,

1:52:13.740 --> 1:52:16.900
 gee, you're a great master sushi chef.

1:52:16.900 --> 1:52:20.220
 Wouldn't you be happier if you did something else?

1:52:21.780 --> 1:52:23.500
 Doesn't seem to happen.

1:52:23.500 --> 1:52:25.700
 That might be something that a weird mind would think.

1:52:25.700 --> 1:52:27.260
 Maybe it is weird people,

1:52:27.260 --> 1:52:29.820
 and maybe they're really enjoying it,

1:52:29.820 --> 1:52:32.820
 but like to learn how to pack rice for 10 years

1:52:32.820 --> 1:52:35.180
 before they let you do anything else.

1:52:35.180 --> 1:52:37.820
 It's like these Indian, you know, sarod players.

1:52:37.820 --> 1:52:40.380
 They just spent five years tapping out rhythms

1:52:40.380 --> 1:52:43.420
 before they're allowed to touch their instruments.

1:52:43.420 --> 1:52:46.220
 Well, actually to defend that.

1:52:46.220 --> 1:52:48.460
 It's kind of like graduate school, right?

1:52:48.460 --> 1:52:51.420
 Well, I think graduate school, perhaps.

1:52:53.700 --> 1:52:54.860
 Graduate school is full of,

1:52:54.860 --> 1:52:59.860
 like every single day is full of surprises, I would say.

1:53:00.260 --> 1:53:01.940
 I did martial arts for a long time.

1:53:01.940 --> 1:53:04.380
 I do martial arts, and I've always loved,

1:53:04.380 --> 1:53:06.900
 it's kind of the Russian way of drilling,

1:53:06.900 --> 1:53:09.180
 is doing the same technique.

1:53:09.180 --> 1:53:10.500
 I don't know if this applies

1:53:10.500 --> 1:53:13.220
 into intellectual or academic disciplines,

1:53:13.220 --> 1:53:16.940
 where you can do the same thing over and over and over again,

1:53:16.940 --> 1:53:19.940
 thousands and thousands and thousands of times.

1:53:19.940 --> 1:53:23.620
 What I've discovered through that process

1:53:23.620 --> 1:53:27.260
 is you get to start to appreciate the tiniest of details

1:53:27.260 --> 1:53:29.420
 and find the beauty in them.

1:53:29.420 --> 1:53:32.020
 People who go to like monasteries to meditate

1:53:32.020 --> 1:53:35.620
 talk about this, is when you just sit in silence

1:53:35.620 --> 1:53:37.420
 and don't do anything,

1:53:37.420 --> 1:53:41.340
 you start to appreciate how much complexity and beauty

1:53:41.340 --> 1:53:43.060
 there is in just the movement of a finger.

1:53:43.060 --> 1:53:47.100
 Like you can spend the whole day joyously thinking about

1:53:47.100 --> 1:53:49.540
 how fun it is to move a finger.

1:53:49.540 --> 1:53:54.540
 And then you can almost become your full weird self

1:53:54.700 --> 1:53:56.940
 about the tiniest details of life.

1:53:56.940 --> 1:53:57.980
 As a thing, you've got to wonder,

1:53:57.980 --> 1:53:59.780
 like, is there a free lunch in there?

1:53:59.780 --> 1:54:01.900
 Are the rest of us moving around too much?

1:54:01.900 --> 1:54:02.820
 Yeah, exactly.

1:54:04.060 --> 1:54:06.620
 They sure feel like they found a free lunch.

1:54:06.620 --> 1:54:09.180
 The people meditate, they're onto something.

1:54:09.180 --> 1:54:11.260
 I tend to think it's like artists,

1:54:11.260 --> 1:54:13.420
 that some percent of people are like that,

1:54:13.420 --> 1:54:14.740
 but most are not.

1:54:14.740 --> 1:54:16.820
 And for most of us, there's no free lunch.

1:54:16.820 --> 1:54:19.100
 Like my free lunch is to move around a lot.

1:54:19.100 --> 1:54:20.820
 In search of lunch, in fact.

1:54:20.820 --> 1:54:24.460
 Well, with all the food talk, you made me hungry.

1:54:24.460 --> 1:54:29.100
 What books, three or so books,

1:54:29.100 --> 1:54:33.500
 if any come to mind, technical fiction, philosophical,

1:54:33.500 --> 1:54:37.340
 would you recommend, had a big impact on you,

1:54:37.340 --> 1:54:40.420
 or you just drew some insights from throughout your life?

1:54:40.420 --> 1:54:42.340
 Well, two of them we've already discussed.

1:54:42.340 --> 1:54:44.740
 One is Plato's Dialogues,

1:54:44.740 --> 1:54:47.620
 which I started reading when I was like 13.

1:54:47.620 --> 1:54:51.100
 Another is Ayn Rand, Capitalism, the Unknown Ideal.

1:54:51.100 --> 1:54:53.860
 But I would say the Friedrich Hayek essay,

1:54:53.860 --> 1:54:56.260
 The Use of Knowledge in Society,

1:54:56.260 --> 1:54:58.940
 which is about how decentralized mechanisms can work,

1:54:58.940 --> 1:55:01.060
 also why they might go wrong.

1:55:01.060 --> 1:55:03.260
 And that's where you start to understand

1:55:03.260 --> 1:55:05.220
 the price system, capitalism.

1:55:05.220 --> 1:55:06.300
 And that was in a book called

1:55:06.300 --> 1:55:08.020
 Individualism and Economic Order,

1:55:08.020 --> 1:55:10.580
 but it was just a few essays in that book.

1:55:10.580 --> 1:55:12.700
 Those are maybe the three I would cite.

1:55:12.700 --> 1:55:14.580
 Can you elaborate a little bit on the...

1:55:14.580 --> 1:55:16.380
 Say the price of copper goes up, right?

1:55:16.380 --> 1:55:18.540
 Because there's a problem with the copper mine

1:55:18.540 --> 1:55:20.660
 in Chile or Bolivia.

1:55:20.660 --> 1:55:21.980
 So the price of copper goes up.

1:55:21.980 --> 1:55:24.860
 All around the world, people are led to economize copper,

1:55:24.860 --> 1:55:26.740
 to look for substitutes for copper,

1:55:26.740 --> 1:55:28.860
 to change their production processes,

1:55:28.860 --> 1:55:31.100
 to change the goods and services they buy,

1:55:31.100 --> 1:55:32.660
 to build homes a different way.

1:55:33.900 --> 1:55:35.500
 And this one event creates

1:55:35.500 --> 1:55:38.100
 this one tiny change in information.

1:55:38.100 --> 1:55:41.220
 This gets into your AI work very directly.

1:55:41.220 --> 1:55:44.780
 And how much complexity that one change engenders

1:55:44.780 --> 1:55:47.140
 in a meaningful, coherent way,

1:55:47.140 --> 1:55:50.780
 how the different pieces of the price system fit together.

1:55:50.780 --> 1:55:53.940
 Hayek really laid out very clearly.

1:55:53.940 --> 1:55:56.340
 And it's like an AI problem.

1:55:56.340 --> 1:55:57.980
 And how well, not for everything,

1:55:57.980 --> 1:56:00.900
 but for many things, we solve that AI problem.

1:56:00.900 --> 1:56:04.780
 I learned, I was, I think 13, maybe 14 when I read Hayek.

1:56:04.780 --> 1:56:07.300
 Yeah, the distributed nature of things there.

1:56:07.300 --> 1:56:09.100
 And it's like your work on human attention,

1:56:09.100 --> 1:56:10.580
 like how much can we take in?

1:56:10.580 --> 1:56:11.620
 Yes.

1:56:11.620 --> 1:56:13.780
 Very often not that much.

1:56:13.780 --> 1:56:16.460
 And how many of the advances of modern civilization

1:56:16.460 --> 1:56:19.500
 you need to understand as a response to that constraint.

1:56:19.500 --> 1:56:21.260
 I got that also from Hayek.

1:56:21.260 --> 1:56:23.900
 And what's the title of the book again?

1:56:23.900 --> 1:56:26.060
 It's reprinted in a lot of books at this point.

1:56:26.060 --> 1:56:27.500
 But back then the book was called

1:56:27.500 --> 1:56:30.460
 Individualism and Economic Order.

1:56:30.460 --> 1:56:31.700
 But the essay is online.

1:56:31.700 --> 1:56:34.500
 Hayek, Use of Knowledge in Society.

1:56:34.500 --> 1:56:37.300
 There are open access versions of it through Google.

1:56:37.300 --> 1:56:39.020
 And you don't need the whole book.

1:56:39.020 --> 1:56:40.340
 So it's a very good book.

1:56:40.340 --> 1:56:45.340
 Again, one of those profound looking over the ocean,

1:56:46.140 --> 1:56:47.860
 maybe sitting on a porch,

1:56:47.860 --> 1:56:49.700
 maybe with a drink of some kind.

1:56:50.940 --> 1:56:55.020
 And a young kid comes by and asks you for advice.

1:56:55.020 --> 1:56:56.620
 What advice would you give to?

1:56:56.620 --> 1:56:57.460
 A drink.

1:56:57.460 --> 1:56:58.620
 That's my advice.

1:56:58.620 --> 1:56:59.460
 I'm serious.

1:57:00.700 --> 1:57:03.100
 So, okay, after that,

1:57:05.780 --> 1:57:09.420
 what advice would you give to a young person today

1:57:09.420 --> 1:57:10.900
 as they take on life?

1:57:10.900 --> 1:57:15.900
 Whether a career in academia in general or just a life,

1:57:15.900 --> 1:57:19.340
 which is probably more important than career.

1:57:19.340 --> 1:57:22.060
 Most good advice is context specific.

1:57:22.060 --> 1:57:24.540
 But here are my two generic pieces of advice.

1:57:24.540 --> 1:57:25.380
 Good.

1:57:25.380 --> 1:57:27.180
 First, get a mentor.

1:57:27.180 --> 1:57:29.100
 Both career, but anything you wanna learn.

1:57:29.100 --> 1:57:31.580
 Like say you wanna learn about contemporary art.

1:57:31.580 --> 1:57:33.060
 People write me this.

1:57:33.060 --> 1:57:34.380
 Oh, what book should I read?

1:57:34.380 --> 1:57:36.420
 It's probably not gonna work that way.

1:57:36.420 --> 1:57:37.260
 You need a mentor.

1:57:37.260 --> 1:57:39.140
 Yes, you should read some books on it.

1:57:39.140 --> 1:57:40.820
 But you want a mentor to help you frame them,

1:57:40.820 --> 1:57:43.900
 take you around to some art, talk about it with you.

1:57:43.900 --> 1:57:45.580
 So get as many mentors as you can

1:57:45.580 --> 1:57:47.660
 in the things you wanna learn.

1:57:47.660 --> 1:57:48.500
 And then...

1:57:48.500 --> 1:57:51.140
 Can I ask you a quick tangent on that?

1:57:52.580 --> 1:57:54.380
 Presumably a good mentor.

1:57:54.380 --> 1:57:55.220
 Of course.

1:57:55.220 --> 1:57:56.060
 Is there...

1:57:56.060 --> 1:57:56.900
 I'm begging the question in there.

1:57:56.900 --> 1:57:59.220
 It's complicated, right?

1:57:59.220 --> 1:58:00.300
 Well, it is complicated.

1:58:00.300 --> 1:58:03.380
 Is there a lot of damage to be done from a bad mentor?

1:58:03.380 --> 1:58:04.300
 I don't think that much

1:58:04.300 --> 1:58:06.020
 because it's very easy to drop mentors.

1:58:06.020 --> 1:58:07.980
 And in fact, it's quite hard to maintain them.

1:58:07.980 --> 1:58:09.620
 Good mentors tend to be busy.

1:58:09.620 --> 1:58:11.220
 Bad mentors tend to be busy.

1:58:12.820 --> 1:58:14.260
 And you can try on mentors

1:58:14.260 --> 1:58:15.460
 and maybe they're not good for you,

1:58:15.460 --> 1:58:17.980
 but there's a good chance you'll learn something.

1:58:19.460 --> 1:58:21.060
 Like I had a mentor, I was an undergrad.

1:58:21.060 --> 1:58:22.620
 He was a Stalinist.

1:58:22.620 --> 1:58:24.700
 He edited the book called The Essential Stalin.

1:58:24.700 --> 1:58:25.740
 Brilliant guy.

1:58:25.740 --> 1:58:28.220
 I learned a tremendous amount from him.

1:58:28.220 --> 1:58:30.660
 Was he like as a Stalinist a good mentor for me?

1:58:30.660 --> 1:58:31.500
 Fan of Hayek?

1:58:31.500 --> 1:58:32.500
 Well, no.

1:58:32.500 --> 1:58:34.180
 But for a year it was tremendous.

1:58:34.180 --> 1:58:35.020
 Yeah.

1:58:38.220 --> 1:58:40.180
 He introduced me like to Soviet

1:58:40.180 --> 1:58:41.780
 and Eastern European science fiction

1:58:41.780 --> 1:58:43.500
 because he was a Marxist.

1:58:43.500 --> 1:58:45.420
 Like that's what I took from him among other things.

1:58:45.420 --> 1:58:47.700
 Any advice on finding a good mentor?

1:58:47.700 --> 1:58:50.980
 Daniel Kahneman has...

1:58:50.980 --> 1:58:52.700
 Somebody just popped this to mind

1:58:52.700 --> 1:58:54.300
 as somebody who was able to find

1:58:54.300 --> 1:58:57.100
 exceptionally good collaborators throughout his life.

1:58:57.100 --> 1:59:00.380
 There's not many bright minds that find collaborators.

1:59:00.380 --> 1:59:05.380
 They often, which I ultimately see what a mentor is.

1:59:06.420 --> 1:59:07.260
 Yeah.

1:59:07.260 --> 1:59:08.900
 Be interesting, be direct and try.

1:59:10.180 --> 1:59:11.660
 It's not like a perfect formula,

1:59:11.660 --> 1:59:12.940
 but it's amazing how many people

1:59:12.940 --> 1:59:14.220
 don't even do those things.

1:59:14.220 --> 1:59:17.540
 Be interesting, be direct and try.

1:59:17.540 --> 1:59:20.140
 Like what you want from a better known person,

1:59:20.140 --> 1:59:22.220
 I would just say be very direct with them.

1:59:22.220 --> 1:59:23.060
 Yeah.

1:59:23.940 --> 1:59:24.780
 Beautiful.

1:59:24.780 --> 1:59:26.540
 What's the second piece of advice?

1:59:26.540 --> 1:59:29.300
 Build small groups of peers.

1:59:29.300 --> 1:59:30.740
 They don't have to be your age,

1:59:30.740 --> 1:59:32.340
 but very often they'll be your age,

1:59:32.340 --> 1:59:33.820
 especially if you're younger

1:59:33.820 --> 1:59:35.380
 with broadly similar interests,

1:59:35.380 --> 1:59:37.260
 but there can be different points of view.

1:59:37.260 --> 1:59:38.980
 People you hang out with,

1:59:38.980 --> 1:59:41.780
 which can include in a WhatsApp group online

1:59:41.780 --> 1:59:43.860
 and like every day or almost every day,

1:59:43.860 --> 1:59:46.180
 they're talking about the thing you care about,

1:59:46.180 --> 1:59:48.780
 trying to solve problems in that thing.

1:59:48.780 --> 1:59:51.060
 And that's your small group and you really like them

1:59:51.060 --> 1:59:52.260
 and they like you and you care

1:59:52.260 --> 1:59:53.940
 what you think about each other

1:59:53.940 --> 1:59:55.860
 and you have this common interest.

1:59:55.860 --> 1:59:57.220
 That's for human connection

1:59:57.220 --> 1:59:58.860
 or that's for development of ideas?

1:59:58.860 --> 2:00:01.380
 It's both, they're not that different.

2:00:01.380 --> 2:00:03.860
 Like Beatles, classic small group, right?

2:00:05.220 --> 2:00:06.580
 But there's so much drama.

2:00:06.580 --> 2:00:08.540
 The Florentine artists, of course there's drama

2:00:08.540 --> 2:00:10.900
 and small groups tend to split up, which is fine,

2:00:10.900 --> 2:00:13.340
 just like entering relationships off an end.

2:00:14.180 --> 2:00:16.900
 But it's remarkable how little has been done

2:00:16.900 --> 2:00:19.940
 that was not done in small groups in some way.

2:00:19.940 --> 2:00:24.940
 So speaking of loss of beautiful relationships,

2:00:24.940 --> 2:00:27.860
 where do you make this whole love thing?

2:00:29.260 --> 2:00:31.620
 Why do humans fall in love?

2:00:31.620 --> 2:00:35.940
 What's the role of love, friendship, family in life?

2:00:37.420 --> 2:00:40.020
 In a successful life or just life in general?

2:00:40.020 --> 2:00:42.100
 Why the hell are we so into this thing?

2:00:42.100 --> 2:00:44.820
 There are multiple layers of understanding that question.

2:00:44.820 --> 2:00:48.660
 So kind of the lowest layer is the Darwinian answer, right?

2:00:48.660 --> 2:00:50.340
 If we weren't this way,

2:00:50.340 --> 2:00:51.700
 we wouldn't have been successful

2:00:51.700 --> 2:00:54.420
 in reproducing and building alliances.

2:00:54.420 --> 2:00:57.580
 It's important to realize that's far from complete.

2:00:57.580 --> 2:00:59.940
 Sort of the highest understanding would be poetic,

2:00:59.940 --> 2:01:03.620
 like read John Keats or many other love poets.

2:01:03.620 --> 2:01:05.540
 So who do I go to to find out,

2:01:05.540 --> 2:01:07.980
 to learn about love in terms of poets or?

2:01:07.980 --> 2:01:10.020
 I would say start with John Keats.

2:01:10.020 --> 2:01:12.500
 But given that you're fluent in Russian.

2:01:13.740 --> 2:01:16.060
 Yeah, let's go Russian literature for a second.

2:01:16.060 --> 2:01:18.580
 Like you keep mentioning Russia.

2:01:18.580 --> 2:01:21.180
 What's your connection?

2:01:21.180 --> 2:01:25.100
 What's your love in Russia?

2:01:25.100 --> 2:01:26.380
 Well, first it's all interesting,

2:01:26.380 --> 2:01:29.340
 but more concretely, my wife was born in Moscow.

2:01:29.340 --> 2:01:31.460
 So Kolniki was her neighborhood.

2:01:31.460 --> 2:01:32.300
 Yeah.

2:01:32.300 --> 2:01:33.140
 Wow.

2:01:33.140 --> 2:01:34.180
 And she grew up there.

2:01:34.180 --> 2:01:35.500
 I married her here.

2:01:36.740 --> 2:01:38.340
 My daughter, I adopted her.

2:01:38.340 --> 2:01:41.260
 I'm not her biological father, but I genuinely raised her.

2:01:41.260 --> 2:01:42.540
 She was born in Russia,

2:01:42.540 --> 2:01:44.340
 though she came here when she was one.

2:01:45.500 --> 2:01:46.340
 My father in law.

2:01:46.340 --> 2:01:47.260
 So you're basically Russian.

2:01:47.260 --> 2:01:48.100
 No, no, no.

2:01:48.100 --> 2:01:49.180
 I'm a New Jersey boy.

2:01:49.180 --> 2:01:51.140
 That's the same thing.

2:01:51.140 --> 2:01:52.220
 I'm very sorry to report.

2:01:52.220 --> 2:01:54.820
 My father in law passed away a week ago.

2:01:54.820 --> 2:01:57.300
 He lived with us for six years.

2:01:57.300 --> 2:02:01.460
 He lived in Russia till he was, oh, 70.

2:02:01.460 --> 2:02:04.180
 Saw Stalinist error.

2:02:04.180 --> 2:02:05.820
 His father was brought to a camp,

2:02:05.820 --> 2:02:07.780
 lived through World War II.

2:02:07.780 --> 2:02:09.580
 Much, much more.

2:02:09.580 --> 2:02:11.820
 Had an incredible life.

2:02:11.820 --> 2:02:14.500
 Never really learned how to speak English.

2:02:14.500 --> 2:02:17.940
 So I absorbed something Russian from him as well.

2:02:17.940 --> 2:02:19.260
 He was part Armenian.

2:02:20.260 --> 2:02:21.980
 So that's my connection to Russia.

2:02:21.980 --> 2:02:24.060
 A bit of the Russian soul, too.

2:02:24.060 --> 2:02:24.900
 Do you?

2:02:24.900 --> 2:02:25.740
 I don't think I have it.

2:02:25.740 --> 2:02:27.580
 I think I appreciate it.

2:02:27.580 --> 2:02:29.020
 But there's division of labor, right?

2:02:29.020 --> 2:02:30.140
 Others in the family.

2:02:31.380 --> 2:02:32.220
 Take care of that.

2:02:32.220 --> 2:02:34.180
 I'm more superficial.

2:02:34.180 --> 2:02:36.940
 You mentioned Keats and that higher version,

2:02:36.940 --> 2:02:38.420
 that non Darwinian love.

2:02:38.420 --> 2:02:39.700
 What's that about?

2:02:39.700 --> 2:02:42.340
 That it's the highest form of human connection

2:02:42.340 --> 2:02:46.860
 and it's intoxicating and it's part of building a life.

2:02:46.860 --> 2:02:50.340
 And most of us are very, very strongly drawn to it.

2:02:50.340 --> 2:02:52.540
 And it's part of the highest realization

2:02:52.540 --> 2:02:54.660
 of you being what you can be.

2:02:54.660 --> 2:02:55.500
 Yeah.

2:02:56.580 --> 2:02:57.540
 He mentioned you lost.

2:02:57.540 --> 2:02:58.380
 But ask a Russian.

2:02:58.380 --> 2:03:01.460
 I mean, this is a superficial New Jersey boy

2:03:01.460 --> 2:03:03.820
 who grew up listening to Bruce Springsteen

2:03:03.820 --> 2:03:05.620
 and that was his romanticism.

2:03:05.620 --> 2:03:09.580
 What's your favorite Bruce Springsteen song?

2:03:09.580 --> 2:03:14.100
 I think the album Born to Run has actually held up the best.

2:03:14.100 --> 2:03:15.900
 Though it's very fashionable to think

2:03:15.900 --> 2:03:18.340
 the earlier or later works are actually better.

2:03:18.340 --> 2:03:21.100
 And that's the overproduced super pop album.

2:03:21.100 --> 2:03:22.380
 But the quality of the songs,

2:03:22.380 --> 2:03:25.380
 to me Born to Run is just far and away the best.

2:03:25.380 --> 2:03:27.540
 Then Darkness on the Edge of Town.

2:03:27.540 --> 2:03:29.860
 And those are still my favorites.

2:03:29.860 --> 2:03:31.660
 Born to Run is an incredible song.

2:03:33.060 --> 2:03:36.460
 And perfectly produced in a Phil Spector kind of way.

2:03:36.460 --> 2:03:38.020
 Every detail is right.

2:03:38.020 --> 2:03:39.220
 Every lyric.

2:03:39.220 --> 2:03:40.580
 What else is on the album?

2:03:40.580 --> 2:03:43.540
 Thunder Road, Jungle Land, Tenth Avenue, Freeze Out.

2:03:43.540 --> 2:03:46.620
 She's the one, unbelievable.

2:03:46.620 --> 2:03:47.460
 Yeah, Bruce is amazing.

2:03:47.460 --> 2:03:48.900
 Leading across the river.

2:03:48.900 --> 2:03:53.900
 I really like when he goes into love personally.

2:03:55.860 --> 2:03:57.780
 Like I'm on fire.

2:03:57.780 --> 2:04:00.340
 That's a very good song, Dancing in the Dark.

2:04:00.340 --> 2:04:01.420
 A lot of the later work,

2:04:01.420 --> 2:04:04.020
 I find the percussion becomes too simple

2:04:04.020 --> 2:04:06.740
 and kind of too white somehow.

2:04:06.740 --> 2:04:08.100
 And a little clunky.

2:04:08.100 --> 2:04:09.580
 And it's still good work.

2:04:09.580 --> 2:04:12.820
 He's super talented, but it doesn't speak to me.

2:04:12.820 --> 2:04:16.020
 But when it all bursts open into the open road,

2:04:16.020 --> 2:04:18.380
 like it does on Born to Run, that's magic.

2:04:19.660 --> 2:04:20.500
 Yeah.

2:04:20.500 --> 2:04:21.340
 Or Rosalita.

2:04:21.340 --> 2:04:22.660
 Have you ever seen him live?

2:04:23.980 --> 2:04:24.900
 Yes, twice.

2:04:26.140 --> 2:04:28.620
 I wonder what he's like live when he was young, right?

2:04:28.620 --> 2:04:29.460
 Those years.

2:04:29.460 --> 2:04:31.220
 I saw him live when he was young.

2:04:31.220 --> 2:04:32.060
 I was young.

2:04:32.980 --> 2:04:34.460
 New Jersey.

2:04:34.460 --> 2:04:37.260
 I was a little disappointed actually.

2:04:37.260 --> 2:04:41.180
 I think what I like best from him is quite studio.

2:04:41.180 --> 2:04:42.260
 He certainly played well.

2:04:42.260 --> 2:04:44.060
 I don't fault his performance.

2:04:44.060 --> 2:04:47.580
 But it's like when I saw Plant and Page of Led Zeppelin.

2:04:47.580 --> 2:04:48.980
 Tremendous creators.

2:04:48.980 --> 2:04:49.820
 And they showed up.

2:04:49.820 --> 2:04:50.660
 They were not drunk.

2:04:50.660 --> 2:04:52.140
 Like they were paying attention.

2:04:52.140 --> 2:04:54.060
 But I was underwhelmed.

2:04:54.060 --> 2:04:56.660
 Because Led Zeppelin, like the Beatles White album,

2:04:56.660 --> 2:04:59.740
 is much more of a studio band than you think at first.

2:04:59.740 --> 2:05:01.220
 And in the case of Bruce Springsteen,

2:05:01.220 --> 2:05:03.220
 I don't know about you, but for me,

2:05:03.220 --> 2:05:05.940
 he's somebody that I connect with the most

2:05:05.940 --> 2:05:10.100
 when I'm alone and there's like a melancholy feeling.

2:05:10.100 --> 2:05:12.620
 And actually, my folks live in Philly.

2:05:12.620 --> 2:05:14.860
 I went to school in Philly.

2:05:14.860 --> 2:05:18.420
 And so, you know, I've, I think I've.

2:05:18.420 --> 2:05:20.020
 You're almost worthy of New Jersey then.

2:05:20.020 --> 2:05:24.020
 Yeah, well you're, you're almost worthy of Russia.

2:05:24.020 --> 2:05:27.260
 So we're, we can connect.

2:05:27.260 --> 2:05:28.580
 And then ask, but I mean, I love Jersey.

2:05:28.580 --> 2:05:33.580
 This is something I feel like, I feel like, I don't know.

2:05:34.660 --> 2:05:36.660
 It's always, there's this beautiful,

2:05:36.660 --> 2:05:39.020
 like there's a diner, Olga's Diner that closed down.

2:05:39.020 --> 2:05:41.540
 I used to go there.

2:05:41.540 --> 2:05:43.860
 There's, there's a melancholy feeling to me.

2:05:43.860 --> 2:05:44.700
 I mean, of course.

2:05:44.700 --> 2:05:47.780
 A thickness to culture in that part of the world.

2:05:47.780 --> 2:05:49.940
 Which is oddly similar to some elements

2:05:49.940 --> 2:05:51.940
 of the thickness of Russian culture.

2:05:51.940 --> 2:05:55.580
 And when you see like Russian characters on the Sopranos,

2:05:55.580 --> 2:05:56.700
 it totally makes sense,

2:05:56.700 --> 2:05:59.460
 even though there are these complete outliers.

2:05:59.460 --> 2:06:01.820
 Exactly, it totally makes sense.

2:06:01.820 --> 2:06:06.180
 You've, you mentioned you lost your father in law last week.

2:06:06.180 --> 2:06:09.580
 Do you think about mortality?

2:06:09.580 --> 2:06:12.420
 Do you think about your own mortality?

2:06:12.420 --> 2:06:14.820
 Are you afraid of death?

2:06:14.820 --> 2:06:17.300
 I don't think about my own mortality that much,

2:06:17.300 --> 2:06:19.020
 which is probably a good thing.

2:06:19.900 --> 2:06:22.340
 I think death will be bad.

2:06:22.340 --> 2:06:23.900
 I wouldn't say I'm afraid of it.

2:06:23.900 --> 2:06:25.420
 For me, the worst thing about death

2:06:25.420 --> 2:06:28.660
 is not knowing how the human story turns out.

2:06:28.660 --> 2:06:29.780
 The full human story.

2:06:29.780 --> 2:06:30.660
 The full human story.

2:06:30.660 --> 2:06:32.780
 So if I could, right before I die,

2:06:32.780 --> 2:06:36.500
 read like a Wikipedia page called The Rest of Human History

2:06:36.500 --> 2:06:38.220
 and have enough time, just like a few days,

2:06:38.220 --> 2:06:40.220
 to absorb it, think about it,

2:06:40.220 --> 2:06:43.220
 and know like, oh, well 643 years from now,

2:06:43.220 --> 2:06:45.060
 that's when all the atomic weapons went off

2:06:45.060 --> 2:06:47.900
 and here's what happened between now and then,

2:06:47.900 --> 2:06:49.580
 I would feel much better dying.

2:06:52.180 --> 2:06:54.100
 But that's not how it's gonna be, right?

2:06:54.100 --> 2:06:55.020
 That's unlikely.

2:06:55.020 --> 2:06:57.020
 It's almost like the Hitchhiker's Guide,

2:06:57.020 --> 2:06:58.780
 they kind of have, what is it?

2:06:58.780 --> 2:07:01.900
 They have a one or two sentence description of the human,

2:07:01.900 --> 2:07:03.580
 of what goes on on Earth.

2:07:03.580 --> 2:07:05.020
 It's kind of interesting to think

2:07:05.020 --> 2:07:07.980
 if there's a lot of intelligent civilizations out there

2:07:07.980 --> 2:07:10.980
 that in the big encyclopedia that describes the universe,

2:07:10.980 --> 2:07:13.660
 humans will only have one sentence, maybe two.

2:07:13.660 --> 2:07:15.100
 Probably true.

2:07:15.100 --> 2:07:15.940
 Yeah.

2:07:15.940 --> 2:07:18.620
 But it's the only one I can read and understand, right?

2:07:18.620 --> 2:07:20.740
 And it may be hard to understand the human one

2:07:20.740 --> 2:07:22.860
 past a number of centuries.

2:07:22.860 --> 2:07:24.580
 Yeah, with AI, yes.

2:07:26.420 --> 2:07:29.060
 Like how many years from now will reading Wikipedia

2:07:29.060 --> 2:07:31.140
 be like trying to read Chaucer,

2:07:31.140 --> 2:07:33.380
 which I almost can do, but I actually can't.

2:07:33.380 --> 2:07:34.860
 I need a translation.

2:07:34.860 --> 2:07:36.380
 Probably you can't do it at all.

2:07:36.380 --> 2:07:37.580
 Yeah.

2:07:37.580 --> 2:07:39.380
 I mean, maybe reading will be outdated.

2:07:39.380 --> 2:07:41.660
 It might be a very silly notion.

2:07:41.660 --> 2:07:43.540
 Maybe we're fundamentally,

2:07:43.540 --> 2:07:46.060
 like we think language is fundamental to cognition,

2:07:46.060 --> 2:07:47.380
 but it could be something visual

2:07:47.380 --> 2:07:50.260
 or something totally different that we'll plug in.

2:07:50.260 --> 2:07:51.700
 Neuralink or, yeah.

2:07:53.500 --> 2:07:55.820
 But in that story, that Wikipedia article,

2:07:55.820 --> 2:08:00.940
 do you think there'll be a section on the meaning of it?

2:08:00.940 --> 2:08:04.780
 I hope not, because that section we could write now,

2:08:04.780 --> 2:08:07.220
 and it's just not going to be very good, right?

2:08:07.220 --> 2:08:08.580
 What would you put in the section

2:08:08.580 --> 2:08:11.620
 on the meaning of human existence?

2:08:11.620 --> 2:08:13.820
 I don't know, links to a lot of other sections?

2:08:15.940 --> 2:08:17.380
 I don't think there are general statements

2:08:17.380 --> 2:08:19.860
 about the meaning of life that have that much meaning.

2:08:19.860 --> 2:08:21.980
 I think if you study different cultures,

2:08:21.980 --> 2:08:23.780
 the arts, travel, mathematics,

2:08:23.780 --> 2:08:25.420
 like whatever your thing is,

2:08:25.420 --> 2:08:27.220
 you'll get a lot about the meaning of life.

2:08:27.220 --> 2:08:30.660
 So like it's there in Wikipedia in some bigger sense.

2:08:30.660 --> 2:08:32.180
 But I don't want to read the page on the meaning.

2:08:32.180 --> 2:08:34.300
 I bet they have such a page, in fact.

2:08:34.300 --> 2:08:36.020
 The fact that I've never visited it,

2:08:36.020 --> 2:08:37.740
 none of my friends, oh, here, Tyler,

2:08:37.740 --> 2:08:39.100
 here's the page on the meaning of life.

2:08:39.100 --> 2:08:40.340
 I know you've been wondering about this.

2:08:40.340 --> 2:08:41.580
 You got to read this one.

2:08:41.580 --> 2:08:43.300
 No one's ever done that to you, have they?

2:08:43.300 --> 2:08:46.020
 It probably has, well, I've actually gone to that page.

2:08:46.020 --> 2:08:48.500
 It does, in fact, have a lot of links to other pages.

2:08:48.500 --> 2:08:49.340
 Okay.

2:08:51.020 --> 2:08:52.540
 So that's it.

2:08:52.540 --> 2:08:57.180
 The meaning of life is just a bunch of self referential

2:08:57.180 --> 2:09:02.180
 or citation needed type of statements.

2:09:02.260 --> 2:09:03.860
 I think there's no better way to end it.

2:09:03.860 --> 2:09:05.100
 Tyler, it's a huge honor.

2:09:05.100 --> 2:09:06.300
 I'm a huge fan.

2:09:07.500 --> 2:09:10.060
 Thank you so much for wasting all of this time with me.

2:09:10.060 --> 2:09:11.980
 It was one of the greatest conversations I've ever had.

2:09:11.980 --> 2:09:12.820
 Thank you so much.

2:09:12.820 --> 2:09:15.220
 My pleasure and delighted to finally have met you

2:09:15.220 --> 2:09:16.860
 and that we can do this.

2:09:17.740 --> 2:09:20.260
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Tyler Cowen

2:09:20.260 --> 2:09:23.580
 and thank you to Linode, ExpressVPN,

2:09:23.580 --> 2:09:25.940
 SimpliSafe and Public Goods.

2:09:25.940 --> 2:09:29.580
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

2:09:29.580 --> 2:09:33.660
 And now let me leave you with some words from Adam Smith.

2:09:33.660 --> 2:09:36.580
 Little else is requisite to carry a state

2:09:36.580 --> 2:09:38.580
 to the highest degree of opulence

2:09:38.580 --> 2:09:42.660
 from the lowest barbarism but peace, easy taxes

2:09:42.660 --> 2:09:45.900
 and a tolerable administration of justice.

2:09:45.900 --> 2:09:57.500
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
