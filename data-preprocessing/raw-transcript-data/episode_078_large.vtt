00:00.000 --> 00:06.100
 The following is a conversation with Anne Drouin, writer, producer, director, and one

00:06.100 --> 00:10.480
 of the most important and impactful communicators of science in our time.

00:10.480 --> 00:16.960
 She co wrote the 1980 science documentary series Cosmos hosted by Carl Sagan, whom she

00:16.960 --> 00:24.280
 married in 1981 and her love for whom, with the help of NASA, was recorded as brainwaves

00:24.280 --> 00:29.320
 on a golden record along with other things our civilization has to offer and launched

00:29.320 --> 00:36.320
 into space on the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft that are now, 42 years later, still

00:36.320 --> 00:43.000
 active, reaching out farther into deep space than any human made object ever has.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.800
 This was a profound and beautiful decision Anne made as the creative director of NASA's

00:48.800 --> 00:51.400
 Voyager Interstellar Message Project.

00:51.400 --> 00:58.560
 In 2014 she went on to create the second season of Cosmos, called Cosmos A Space Time Odyssey,

00:58.560 --> 01:05.440
 in 2020 the new third season called Cosmos Possible Worlds, which is being released this

01:05.440 --> 01:07.520
 upcoming Monday, March 9th.

01:07.520 --> 01:14.920
 It is hosted, once again, by the fun and the brilliant Neil deGrasse Tyson.

01:14.920 --> 01:21.320
 Carl Sagan, Anne Drouin, and Cosmos have inspired millions of scientists and curious minds across

01:21.320 --> 01:27.680
 several generations by revealing the magic, the power, the beauty of science.

01:27.680 --> 01:33.920
 I am one such curious mind, and if you listened to this podcast, you may know that Elon Musk

01:33.920 --> 01:35.480
 is as well.

01:35.480 --> 01:40.400
 He graciously agreed to read Carl Sagan's words about the pale blue dot in my second

01:40.400 --> 01:42.280
 conversation with him.

01:42.280 --> 01:48.280
 If you listened, there was an interesting and inspiring twist at the end.

01:48.280 --> 01:53.160
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast, if you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, give

01:53.160 --> 01:58.200
 it 5 stars on Apple Podcast, support it on Patreon, or connect with me on Twitter at

01:58.200 --> 02:02.360
 Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

02:02.360 --> 02:06.840
 As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now and never any ads in the middle that

02:06.840 --> 02:08.960
 can break the flow of the conversation.

02:08.960 --> 02:13.800
 I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

02:13.800 --> 02:18.320
 This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.

02:18.320 --> 02:21.480
 When you get it, use code LEX PODCAST.

02:21.480 --> 02:26.040
 Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with

02:26.040 --> 02:28.840
 as little as $1.

02:28.840 --> 02:34.400
 Since Cash App allows you to send and receive money digitally, peer to peer, and security

02:34.400 --> 02:39.600
 in all digital transactions is very important, let me mention the PCI data security standard

02:39.600 --> 02:41.440
 that Cash App is compliant with.

02:41.440 --> 02:45.320
 I'm a big fan of standards for safety and security.

02:45.320 --> 02:50.760
 PCI DSS is a good example of that, where a bunch of competitors got together and agreed

02:50.760 --> 02:55.480
 that there needs to be a global standard around the security of transactions.

02:55.480 --> 02:59.820
 Now we just need to do the same for autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence systems

02:59.820 --> 03:01.820
 in general.

03:01.820 --> 03:06.200
 So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play, and use the code LEX

03:06.200 --> 03:13.120
 PODCAST, you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, one of my favorite organizations

03:13.120 --> 03:19.280
 that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world.

03:19.280 --> 03:24.480
 And now, here's my conversation with Anne Drouin.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.960
 What is the role of science in our society?

03:26.960 --> 03:35.800
 Well, I think of what Einstein said when he opened the 1939 New York World's Fair.

03:35.800 --> 03:46.920
 He said, if science is ever to fulfill its mission the way art has done, it must penetrate.

03:46.920 --> 03:53.420
 Its inner meaning must penetrate the consciousness of everyone.

03:53.420 --> 04:00.660
 And so for me, especially in a civilization dependent on high technology and science,

04:00.660 --> 04:12.280
 one that aspires to be democratic, it's critical that the public, as informed decision makers,

04:12.280 --> 04:18.200
 understand the values and the methods and the rules of science.

04:18.200 --> 04:24.360
 So you think about what you just mentioned, the values and the methods and the rules and

04:24.360 --> 04:30.440
 maybe the technology that science produces, but what about sort of the beauty, the mystery

04:30.440 --> 04:31.440
 of science?

04:31.440 --> 04:37.340
 Well, you've touched on what I think is for me, that's how my way into science is that

04:37.340 --> 04:42.160
 for me, it's much more spiritually uplifting.

04:42.160 --> 04:50.320
 The revelations of science, the collective revelations of really countless generations

04:50.320 --> 04:58.280
 of searchers and the little tiny bit we know about reality is the greatest joy for me because

04:58.280 --> 05:02.120
 I think that it relates to the idea of love.

05:02.120 --> 05:07.600
 What is love that is based on illusion about the other?

05:07.600 --> 05:08.600
 That's not love.

05:08.600 --> 05:16.220
 Love is seeing, unflinching the other and accepting with all your heart.

05:16.220 --> 05:21.440
 And to me, knowing the universe as it is, or the little bit that we're able to understand

05:21.440 --> 05:25.380
 at this point is the purest kind of love.

05:25.380 --> 05:32.800
 And therefore, you know, how can our philosophy, our religion, if it's rootless in nature,

05:32.800 --> 05:35.520
 how can it really be true?

05:35.520 --> 05:36.800
 I just don't understand.

05:36.800 --> 05:47.000
 So I think you need science to get a sense of the real romance of life and the great

05:47.000 --> 05:50.800
 experience of being awake in the cosmos.

05:50.800 --> 05:59.040
 So the fact that we know so little, the humbling nature of that, and you kind of connect love

05:59.040 --> 06:04.560
 to that, but isn't it also, isn't it scary?

06:04.560 --> 06:06.880
 Why is it so inspiring, do you think?

06:06.880 --> 06:10.080
 Why is it so beautiful that we know so little?

06:10.080 --> 06:16.560
 Well, first of all, as Socrates thought, you know, knowing that you know little is knowing,

06:16.560 --> 06:19.760
 really knowing something, knowing more than others.

06:19.760 --> 06:27.200
 And it's that voice whispering in our heads, you know, you might be wrong, which I think

06:27.200 --> 06:32.920
 is not only it's really healthy because we're so imperfect, we're human, of course, but

06:32.920 --> 06:38.960
 also, you know, love to me is the feeling that you always want to go deeper, get closer.

06:38.960 --> 06:41.520
 You can't get enough of it.

06:41.520 --> 06:44.920
 You can't get close enough, deep enough.

06:44.920 --> 06:50.240
 So and that's what science is always saying is science is never simply content with its

06:50.240 --> 06:53.700
 understanding of any aspect of nature.

06:53.700 --> 06:59.760
 It's always saying it's always finding that even smaller cosmos beneath.

06:59.760 --> 07:04.000
 So I think the two are very much parallel.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.680
 So you said that love is not an illusion.

07:08.680 --> 07:09.680
 No, it's not.

07:09.680 --> 07:12.160
 What is love?

07:12.160 --> 07:21.560
 What is love is, is knowing, for me, love is, is knowing something deeply and still

07:21.560 --> 07:28.400
 being completely gratified by it, you know, and wanting to know more.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.240
 So what is love?

07:30.240 --> 07:40.720
 What is loving someone, a person, let's say deeply is not idealizing them, not putting

07:40.720 --> 07:48.880
 some kind of subjective projection on them, but knowing them as they are.

07:48.880 --> 07:55.080
 And so for me, for me, the only aperture to that knowing about nature, the universe is

07:55.080 --> 08:00.520
 science because it has that error correcting mechanism that most of the stuff that we do

08:00.520 --> 08:01.520
 doesn't have.

08:01.520 --> 08:05.800
 You know, you could say the Bill of Rights is kind of an error correcting mechanism,

08:05.800 --> 08:12.080
 which is one of the things I really appreciate about the society in which I live to the extent

08:12.080 --> 08:17.240
 that it's upheld and we keep faith with it and the same with science.

08:17.240 --> 08:25.040
 It's like we will give you the highest rewards we have for proving us wrong about something.

08:25.040 --> 08:27.700
 It's genius.

08:27.700 --> 08:36.640
 That's why, that's why in only 400 years since Galileo's first look through a telescope,

08:36.640 --> 08:46.660
 we could get from this really dim, vague, this vague apprehension of another world to

08:46.660 --> 08:52.440
 sending our eyes and our senses there or even to going beyond.

08:52.440 --> 08:59.860
 So it is, it is, it delivers the goods like nothing else, you know, it really, it delivers

08:59.860 --> 09:06.440
 the goods because it's always, it's always self aware of its fallibility.

09:06.440 --> 09:12.560
 So on that topic, I'd like to ask your opinion and a feeling I have that I'm not sure what

09:12.560 --> 09:18.220
 to do with, which is the, the skeptical aspect of science.

09:18.220 --> 09:24.280
 So the modern skeptics community and just in general, certain scientists, many scientists,

09:24.280 --> 09:30.840
 maybe most scientists that apply the scientific method are kind of rigorous in that application.

09:30.840 --> 09:35.640
 And they, it feels like sometimes miss out some of the ideas outside the reaches, just

09:35.640 --> 09:37.840
 slightly outside of the reach of science.

09:37.840 --> 09:43.220
 And they don't dare to sort of dream or think of revolutionary ideas that others will call

09:43.220 --> 09:45.160
 crazy in this particular moment.

09:45.160 --> 09:50.600
 So how do you think about the skeptical aspect of science that is really good at sort of

09:50.600 --> 09:55.640
 keeping us in check, keeping us humble, but, but at the same time, sort of the kind of

09:55.640 --> 10:01.240
 dreams that you and Carl Sagan have inspired in the world, it kind of shuts it down sometimes

10:01.240 --> 10:02.240
 a little bit.

10:02.240 --> 10:03.240
 Yeah.

10:03.240 --> 10:08.420
 I mean, I think it's up to the individual, but for me, you know, I was so ridiculously

10:08.420 --> 10:14.120
 fortunate in that I, my tutorial in science, because I'm not a scientist and I wasn't trained

10:14.120 --> 10:20.480
 in science, was 20 years of days and nights with Carl Sagan.

10:20.480 --> 10:26.480
 And the wonder, I think the reason Carl remains so beloved, well, I think there are many reasons,

10:26.480 --> 10:33.440
 but at the root of it is the fact that his skepticism was never at the cost of his wonder

10:33.440 --> 10:38.280
 and his wonder was never at the cost of his skepticism.

10:38.280 --> 10:42.640
 So he couldn't fool himself into believing something he wanted to believe because it

10:42.640 --> 10:45.440
 made him feel good at the other.

10:45.440 --> 10:52.640
 But on the other hand, he recognized that what science, what nature is, it's really,

10:52.640 --> 10:57.600
 it's good enough, you know, it's way better than our fantasies.

10:57.600 --> 11:04.560
 And so if you, if you're that kind of person who loves happiness, loves life and your eyes

11:04.560 --> 11:09.560
 are wide open and you read everything you can get your hands on and you spend years

11:09.560 --> 11:18.680
 studying what is known so far about the universe, then you have that capacity, a really infinite

11:18.680 --> 11:27.440
 capacity to be alive, but all, and also at the same time to be very rigorous about what

11:27.440 --> 11:28.920
 you're willing to believe.

11:28.920 --> 11:36.280
 For Carl, I don't think he ever felt that his skepticism cost him anything because again,

11:36.280 --> 11:37.700
 it comes back to love.

11:37.700 --> 11:44.320
 He wanted to know what Nietzsche really was like, not to inflict his, you know, preconceived

11:44.320 --> 11:46.560
 notions on what he wanted it to be.

11:46.560 --> 11:51.720
 So you can't go wrong because it doesn't, you know, I mean, you know, I think the pale

11:51.720 --> 12:01.400
 blue dot is the, is a perfect example of this, of his massive achievement is to say, okay,

12:01.400 --> 12:07.080
 or the Voyager record is another example is here we have this mission, our first reconnaissance

12:07.080 --> 12:09.240
 of the outer solar system.

12:09.240 --> 12:19.320
 Well, how can we make it a mission in which we absolutely squeeze every drop of consciousness

12:19.320 --> 12:21.880
 and understanding from it?

12:21.880 --> 12:25.880
 We don't have to be scientists and then be human beings.

12:25.880 --> 12:33.000
 I think that's the tragedy of Western civilization is that it's, you know, when it's one of its

12:33.000 --> 12:42.600
 greatest gifts has been science and yet at the same time, it believing that we are the

12:42.600 --> 12:50.480
 children of a disappointed father, a tyrant who puts us in a maximum security prison and

12:50.480 --> 12:57.400
 calls it paradise, who looks at us, who watches us every moment and hates us for being our

12:57.400 --> 13:00.080
 human selves, you know?

13:00.080 --> 13:03.040
 And then most of all, what is our great sin?

13:03.040 --> 13:09.500
 It's partaking of the tree of knowledge, which is our greatest gift as humans.

13:09.500 --> 13:17.680
 This pattern recognition, this ability to see things and then synthesize them and jump

13:17.680 --> 13:21.360
 to conclusions about them and test those conclusions.

13:21.360 --> 13:31.480
 So I think the reason that in literature, in movies, the scientist is a figure of alienation,

13:31.480 --> 13:37.600
 a figure, you know, oh, you see these biopics about scientists and yeah, he might've been

13:37.600 --> 13:41.760
 great, but you know, he was missing in ship.

13:41.760 --> 13:44.480
 You know, he was a lousy husband.

13:44.480 --> 13:52.160
 He lacked, you know, the kind of spiritual understanding that maybe, you know, his wife

13:52.160 --> 13:59.040
 had and it's always in the end and they come around, but to me, that's a false dichotomy

13:59.040 --> 14:05.280
 that we are, you know, to the extent that we are aware of our surroundings and understand

14:05.280 --> 14:10.200
 them, which is what science makes it possible for us to do, we're even more alive.

14:10.200 --> 14:16.240
 So you mentioned a million awesome things there, let's even just, can you tell me about

14:16.240 --> 14:22.680
 the Voyager one and two spacecraft and the interstellar message project and that whole

14:22.680 --> 14:24.840
 just fascinating world leading up to.

14:24.840 --> 14:27.480
 One of my favorite subjects, I love talking about it.

14:27.480 --> 14:29.000
 I'll never get over it.

14:29.000 --> 14:35.280
 I'll never be able to really wrap my head around the reality of it, the truth of it.

14:35.280 --> 14:36.280
 What is it first of all?

14:36.280 --> 14:37.280
 What's the Voyager spacecraft?

14:37.280 --> 14:44.640
 Okay, so Voyagers one and two were our first reconnaissance mission of what was then considered

14:44.640 --> 14:49.480
 the outer solar system and it was a gift of gravity.

14:49.480 --> 14:58.360
 The idea that swinging around these worlds gives you a gravitational assist, which ultimately

14:58.360 --> 15:06.520
 will send you out of the solar system to wander the Milky Way galaxy for one to five billion

15:06.520 --> 15:08.000
 years.

15:08.000 --> 15:19.320
 So Voyager gave us our first close up look of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.

15:19.320 --> 15:21.760
 It discovered new moons.

15:21.760 --> 15:28.360
 It discovered volcanoes on Io.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.320
 Its achievements are astonishing.

15:31.320 --> 15:37.240
 And remember, this is technology from the early to mid 1970s.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.240
 And it's still active.

15:38.240 --> 15:39.280
 And it's still active.

15:39.280 --> 15:42.340
 We talked to Voyager a few days ago.

15:42.340 --> 15:46.400
 We talked to it, in fact, a year ago, I think it was.

15:46.400 --> 15:50.760
 We needed to slightly change the attitude of the spacecraft.

15:50.760 --> 15:55.680
 And so we fired up its thrusters for the first time since 1987.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.680
 Did they work?

15:57.680 --> 15:58.680
 Instantly.

15:58.680 --> 16:04.040
 It was as if you had left your car in the garage in 1987.

16:04.040 --> 16:09.080
 And you put the key in the ignition because you use keys then in the ignition and it turned

16:09.080 --> 16:12.360
 over the first time you stepped on the gas.

16:12.360 --> 16:17.280
 And so that's the genius of the engineering of Voyager.

16:17.280 --> 16:26.120
 And Carl was one of the key participants in imagining what its mission would be because

16:26.120 --> 16:35.920
 it was a gift actually of the fact that every 175 years, plus or minus, there is an alignment

16:35.920 --> 16:36.920
 of the worlds.

16:36.920 --> 16:44.940
 And so you could send two spacecraft to these other worlds and photograph them and use your

16:44.940 --> 16:54.080
 mass spectrometer and all the other devices on Voyager to really explore these worlds.

16:54.080 --> 17:00.520
 And it's the farthest spacecraft, it's the farthest human creation away from us today.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.520
 Voyager 1.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.520
 Voyager 1.

17:02.520 --> 17:08.920
 These two spacecraft not only gave us our first close up look at hundreds of moons and

17:08.920 --> 17:17.720
 planets, these four giant planets, but also it told us the shape of the solar system as

17:17.720 --> 17:23.400
 it moves through the galaxy because there were two of them going in different directions

17:23.400 --> 17:28.120
 and they finally, and they arrived at a place called the heliopause, which is where the

17:28.120 --> 17:35.080
 wind from the sun, the solar wind dies down and the interstellar medium begins.

17:35.080 --> 17:41.900
 And both Voyagers were the first spacecraft that we had that could tell us when that happened.

17:41.900 --> 17:50.120
 So it's a consummate, I think it's the greatest scientific achievement of the 20th century.

17:50.120 --> 17:51.960
 And engineering in some sense.

17:51.960 --> 17:59.760
 Engineering, I mean really, you know, Voyager is doing this on less energy than you have

17:59.760 --> 18:04.160
 in your toaster, something like 11 Watts.

18:04.160 --> 18:10.440
 So okay, but because of this gravitational assist, both Voyagers were destined, as I

18:10.440 --> 18:16.040
 say, to, first of all, they were supposed to function for a dozen years and now it's

18:16.040 --> 18:20.920
 42 years since launch and we're still talking to them.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.960
 So that's amazing.

18:22.960 --> 18:31.080
 But prior to launch, almost a year, eight, nine months prior to launch, it was decided

18:31.080 --> 18:36.640
 that since Frank Drake and Carl Sagan and Linda Solzman Sagan had created something

18:36.640 --> 18:44.680
 called the Pioneer 10 Plaque for the Pioneer spacecraft that preceded Voyager, which was

18:44.680 --> 18:50.560
 kind of like a license plate for the planet Earth, you know, man and a woman, hands up,

18:50.560 --> 18:55.920
 you know, very, very basic, but very effective.

18:55.920 --> 18:59.560
 And it captured the imagination of people all over the world.

18:59.560 --> 19:08.760
 And so NASA turned to Frank and to Carl and said, we'd like you to do a message for Voyager

19:08.760 --> 19:16.400
 because if it's going to be circumnavigating the Milky Way galaxy for one to five billion

19:16.400 --> 19:20.640
 years, you know, it's like 20 trips around the galaxy.

19:20.640 --> 19:27.800
 And there's a very small chance that a space faring civilization would be able to flag

19:27.800 --> 19:29.640
 one of them down.

19:29.640 --> 19:37.240
 And so on board, you see this exquisite golden disc with scientific hieroglyphics explaining

19:37.240 --> 19:48.760
 our address and various basic scientific concepts that we believe that would be common to any

19:48.760 --> 19:51.440
 space faring civilization.

19:51.440 --> 20:00.680
 And then beneath this exquisite golden disc is the Voyager record, the golden record.

20:00.680 --> 20:14.640
 And it contains something like 118 photographs, images of life on Earth, as well as 27 pieces

20:14.640 --> 20:19.160
 of music from all around the world.

20:19.160 --> 20:22.560
 Many people describe it as the invention of world music.

20:22.560 --> 20:27.280
 World music was not a concept that existed before the Voyager record.

20:27.280 --> 20:33.080
 And we were determined to take our music, not just from the dominant technical cultures,

20:33.080 --> 20:39.420
 but from all of the rich cultural heritage of the Earth.

20:39.420 --> 20:47.800
 And there's a sound essay, which is a kind of using a microphone as a camera to tell

20:47.800 --> 20:57.280
 the story of the Earth, beginning with its geological sounds and moving into biology

20:57.280 --> 21:00.440
 and then into technology.

21:00.440 --> 21:08.680
 And I think what you were getting at is that at the end of this sound essay, I had asked

21:08.680 --> 21:15.120
 Carl if it were, in the making of the record, it was my honor to be the creative director

21:15.120 --> 21:23.160
 of the project, if it was possible to, if I had meditated for an hour while I was hooked

21:23.160 --> 21:34.460
 up so that every single signal that was coming from my brain, my body, was recorded and then

21:34.460 --> 21:39.000
 converted into sound for the record.

21:39.000 --> 21:44.960
 Was it possible that these putative extraterrestrials of the distant future, of perhaps a billion

21:44.960 --> 21:51.800
 years from now, would be able to reconstitute this message and to understand it?

21:51.800 --> 21:56.160
 And he just, big smile, you know, and just said, well, hey, a billion years is a long

21:56.160 --> 21:57.160
 time.

21:57.160 --> 21:58.160
 It's a long time.

21:58.160 --> 21:59.160
 Go do it.

21:59.160 --> 22:01.200
 And so I did this.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.480
 And what were you thinking about in the meditation?

22:03.480 --> 22:09.160
 Like what, I mean, it's such an interesting idea of recording as you think about things.

22:09.160 --> 22:10.760
 What were you thinking about?

22:10.760 --> 22:17.900
 So I was blindfolded and couldn't hear anything.

22:17.900 --> 22:23.320
 And I had made a mental itinerary of exactly where I wanted to go.

22:23.320 --> 22:33.880
 I was truly humbled by the idea that these thoughts could conceivably touch the distant

22:33.880 --> 22:34.880
 future.

22:34.880 --> 22:35.880
 Yeah, that's incredible.

22:35.880 --> 22:41.600
 So in 1977, there are some 60,000 nuclear weapons on the planet.

22:41.600 --> 22:51.160
 The Soviet Union and the United States are engaged in a, you know, to the death competition.

22:51.160 --> 22:59.240
 And so I began by trying to tell the history of the planet in, you know, to my limited

22:59.240 --> 23:06.760
 ability what I understood about the story of the early existence of the planet, about

23:06.760 --> 23:16.640
 the origin of life, about the evolution of life, about the history of humans, about our

23:16.640 --> 23:25.540
 current at that time predicament, about the fact that one in five of us was starving or

23:25.540 --> 23:29.320
 unable to get potable water.

23:29.320 --> 23:37.200
 And so I sort of gave a kind of, you know, as general a picture as I possibly could of

23:37.200 --> 23:39.520
 our predicament.

23:39.520 --> 23:50.860
 And I also was very newly within days of the moment when Carl and I fell in love with each

23:50.860 --> 23:51.860
 other.

23:51.860 --> 23:55.600
 We had fallen in love with each other long before because we'd known each other for years,

23:55.600 --> 23:59.680
 but it was the first time that we had expressed our feelings for each other.

23:59.680 --> 24:01.800
 Acknowledged it, the existence of this love.

24:01.800 --> 24:09.560
 Yes, because we were both involved with other people and it was a completely outside his

24:09.560 --> 24:13.920
 morality and mine to even broach the subject.

24:13.920 --> 24:17.600
 But it was only days after that it happened.

24:17.600 --> 24:20.760
 And for me, it was a eureka moment.

24:20.760 --> 24:28.800
 It was in the context of finding that piece of Chinese music that was worthy to represent

24:28.800 --> 24:34.440
 one of the oldest musical traditions on earth when those of us who worked on the Voyager

24:34.440 --> 24:38.120
 record were completely ignorant about Chinese music.

24:38.120 --> 24:46.400
 And so that had been a constant challenge for me, talking to professors of Chinese music,

24:46.400 --> 24:51.840
 listening to musicologists everywhere and all through the project, desperately trying

24:51.840 --> 24:54.200
 to find this one piece.

24:54.200 --> 25:02.400
 Found the piece, lived on the Upper West Side, found the piece, a professor at Columbia University

25:02.400 --> 25:04.600
 gave it to me.

25:04.600 --> 25:08.960
 And of all the people I talked to, everyone had said, that's hopeless.

25:08.960 --> 25:09.960
 You can't do that.

25:09.960 --> 25:12.880
 There can't be one piece of Chinese music.

25:12.880 --> 25:17.760
 But he was completely, no problem, I've got it.

25:17.760 --> 25:24.840
 And so he told me the story of the piece, which only made it an even greater candidate

25:24.840 --> 25:27.280
 for the record.

25:27.280 --> 25:35.920
 And I listened to it, called Carl Sagan, who was in Tucson, Arizona addressing the American

25:35.920 --> 25:40.920
 Society of Newspaper Editors.

25:40.920 --> 25:45.800
 And I left him a message, hotel message center.

25:45.800 --> 25:51.480
 And he called me back an hour later.

25:51.480 --> 25:58.200
 And I heard this beautiful voice say, I get back to my hotel room, and I find this message

25:58.200 --> 26:00.160
 that Annie called.

26:00.160 --> 26:05.460
 And I asked myself, why didn't you leave me this message 10 years ago?

26:05.460 --> 26:09.440
 My heart was beating out of my chest.

26:09.440 --> 26:19.960
 I, it was for me a kind of eureka moment, a scientific breakthrough, a truth, a great

26:19.960 --> 26:24.120
 truth had suddenly been revealed.

26:24.120 --> 26:27.760
 And of course, I was awkward and didn't really know what to say.

26:27.760 --> 26:32.040
 And so I blurted something out like, oh, I've been meaning to talk to you about that, Carl,

26:32.040 --> 26:33.040
 which wasn't really true.

26:33.040 --> 26:34.480
 I never would have talked to him about it.

26:34.480 --> 26:36.400
 We had been alone countless times.

26:36.400 --> 26:41.880
 We humans are so awkward in these moments and these amazing moments.

26:41.880 --> 26:45.500
 And I just said, for keeps.

26:45.500 --> 26:51.880
 And he thought for a very brief, like a second and said, you mean get married?

26:51.880 --> 26:52.880
 And I said, yeah.

26:52.880 --> 26:55.460
 And he said, yeah.

26:55.460 --> 27:00.280
 And we put down the phone.

27:00.280 --> 27:10.080
 And I literally was jumping around my apartment like a lunatic, because it was so obvious,

27:10.080 --> 27:12.920
 you know, it was something like, of course.

27:12.920 --> 27:14.320
 And then the phone rang again.

27:14.320 --> 27:19.400
 And I thought, damn, no, he's going to say, I don't know what I was saying.

27:19.400 --> 27:20.400
 I am married.

27:20.400 --> 27:21.400
 I have a kid.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.600
 I'm not going to do this, you know?

27:23.600 --> 27:27.920
 But he was like, I just want to make sure that that really happened.

27:27.920 --> 27:28.920
 And I said, yeah.

27:28.920 --> 27:30.800
 And he said, we're getting married.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.960
 And I said, yeah, we're getting married.

27:32.960 --> 27:36.760
 Now this was June 1st, 1977.

27:36.760 --> 27:42.240
 The records had not been affixed to the spacecraft yet.

27:42.240 --> 27:47.560
 And there had been a lot of controversy about what we were doing.

27:47.560 --> 27:58.120
 I should say that among the 118 pictures was an image of a man and a woman, frontally,

27:58.120 --> 28:00.080
 completely naked.

28:00.080 --> 28:07.880
 And there was, I believe, a congressman on the floor that said, NASA to send smut to

28:07.880 --> 28:09.800
 the stars, you know?

28:09.800 --> 28:14.560
 And so NASA really, they got very upset and they said, you can't send a picture.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.360
 And we had done it so that it was so brilliant.

28:16.360 --> 28:20.580
 It was like this lovely couple, completely naked.

28:20.580 --> 28:29.080
 And then the next image was a kind of overlay schematic to show the fetus inside this woman

28:29.080 --> 28:30.360
 that was developing.

28:30.360 --> 28:36.440
 And then that went off into, you know, additional imagery of human reproduction.

28:36.440 --> 28:44.600
 And it really hit me that how much we hate ourselves, that we couldn't bear to be seen

28:44.600 --> 28:46.600
 as we are.

28:46.600 --> 28:53.200
 So in some sense that congressman also represents our society.

28:53.200 --> 28:55.840
 Perhaps his opposition should have been included as well.

28:55.840 --> 28:56.840
 Yes.

28:56.840 --> 29:02.240
 Well, that was one of the most vigorous debates during the making of the record with the,

29:02.240 --> 29:08.000
 you know, the five, six people that we collaborated with was, do we show, do we only put our best

29:08.000 --> 29:09.640
 foot forward?

29:09.640 --> 29:17.520
 Or do we show Hiroshima, Auschwitz, the Congo, what we have done?

29:17.520 --> 29:20.800
 What do you think represents humanity?

29:20.800 --> 29:26.440
 If you kind of, if you think about it, do our darker moments, are they essential for

29:26.440 --> 29:27.440
 humanity?

29:27.440 --> 29:32.360
 All the wars we've been through, all the tortures and the suffering and the cruelty.

29:32.360 --> 29:37.400
 Is that essential for happiness, for beauty, for creation, generally speaking?

29:37.400 --> 29:40.600
 Well, certainly not essential for happiness or beauty, that's for sure.

29:40.600 --> 29:45.920
 I mean, it's part of who we are, if we're going to be real about it, which is, you know,

29:45.920 --> 29:51.840
 I think we tell on ourselves, even if we don't want to be real, we, you know, I think that

29:51.840 --> 29:58.320
 if you're a spacefaring civilization, and you've gotten it together sufficiently, that

29:58.320 --> 30:05.240
 you can move from world to world, then I think they probably took one look at this derelict

30:05.240 --> 30:11.840
 spacecraft and they knew that these were people in their technological adolescence, and they

30:11.840 --> 30:18.600
 were just setting forth, and they must have had these issues, you know, because it's,

30:18.600 --> 30:24.200
 and so it really, you know, that's the great thing about lying is that a lie only has a

30:24.200 --> 30:25.200
 shelf life.

30:25.200 --> 30:32.480
 It's like, if like a great work of art that's a forgery, people can be fooled immediately,

30:32.480 --> 30:37.300
 but 10 or 15 years, 20 years later, they start to look at it and, you know, they begin to

30:37.300 --> 30:45.480
 realize the lens, our lens of our present is coloring everything that we see.

30:45.480 --> 30:52.520
 So you know, I think it didn't matter that we didn't show our atrocities.

30:52.520 --> 30:54.200
 They would fill in the blanks.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.200
 They would fill in the blanks.

30:55.200 --> 31:02.440
 So let me sort of ask, you've mentioned how unlikely it is that you and Carl did two souls

31:02.440 --> 31:06.340
 like yours would meet in this vast world.

31:06.340 --> 31:12.000
 What are your views on how and why incredibly unlikely things like these nevertheless do

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
 happen?

31:13.000 --> 31:15.240
 It's purely to me, chance.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.920
 It's totally random.

31:17.920 --> 31:24.080
 It's a just, I mean, but, and the fact is, is that some people are, and it's happening

31:24.080 --> 31:26.120
 every day right now.

31:26.120 --> 31:33.080
 Some people are the random casualties of chance and that, and I don't just mean the people

31:33.080 --> 31:41.200
 who are being, you know, destroyed in childhood, in wartime, I'm also, or the people who starved

31:41.200 --> 31:52.120
 to death because of famine, but also the people who, you know, who are not living to the fullest,

31:52.120 --> 31:53.120
 all of these things.

31:53.120 --> 31:57.560
 And I think there's a, my parents met on the subway in rush hour.

31:57.560 --> 32:03.560
 And so I'm only here with you because of the most random possible situation.

32:03.560 --> 32:08.600
 And so I've had this, a sense of this, even before I knew Carl, I always felt this way

32:08.600 --> 32:17.360
 that I only existed because of the generosity of the rush hour, no, of just all of the things,

32:17.360 --> 32:21.360
 all of the skeins of causality.

32:21.360 --> 32:26.680
 It's interesting because, you know, the rush hour is a source of stress for a lot of people,

32:26.680 --> 32:32.560
 but clearly in its moments, it can also be a source of something beautiful.

32:32.560 --> 32:33.560
 That's right.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.340
 Of strangers meeting and so on.

32:35.340 --> 32:43.000
 So everything, everything is, has a possibility of doing something beautiful.

32:43.000 --> 32:50.080
 So let me ask sort of a quick tangent on the Voyager, this, this beautiful romantic notion

32:50.080 --> 32:55.880
 that Voyager One is sort of our farthest human reach into space.

32:55.880 --> 33:00.940
 If you think of what, I don't know if you've seen, but what Elon Musk did with putting

33:00.940 --> 33:07.280
 the Roadster, letting it fly out into space, there's a sort of humor to it.

33:07.280 --> 33:12.000
 I think that's also kind of interesting, but maybe you can comment on that.

33:12.000 --> 33:20.080
 But in general, if now that we are developing what we were venturing out into space again

33:20.080 --> 33:26.720
 in a more serious way, what kind of stuff that represent since Voyager was launched,

33:26.720 --> 33:28.960
 should we send out as a followup?

33:28.960 --> 33:35.160
 Is there things that you think that's developed in the next, in the 40 years after that we

33:35.160 --> 33:38.160
 should update the spacefaring aliens?

33:38.160 --> 33:44.640
 Well, of course now we could send the worldwide, we could send everything that's on the worldwide

33:44.640 --> 33:45.640
 web.

33:45.640 --> 33:50.760
 We could send, I mean, you know, that was a time when we're talking about photograph records

33:50.760 --> 33:59.280
 and transistor radios and, you know, so we tried to be, to take advantage of the existing

33:59.280 --> 34:04.660
 technology to the fullest extent, you know, the computer that was hooked up to me from

34:04.660 --> 34:09.360
 my brainwaves and my heart sounds while I was meditating was, you know, the size of

34:09.360 --> 34:11.000
 a gigantic room.

34:11.000 --> 34:17.420
 And I'm sure it's not that, it didn't have the power of a phone, as the phone has now.

34:17.420 --> 34:22.640
 So you know, now we could just, I think we could let it all hang out and just like send,

34:22.640 --> 34:23.640
 you know, every week.

34:23.640 --> 34:30.980
 I mean, that's the wonder, like I would send, you know, Wikipedia or something and not be

34:30.980 --> 34:34.480
 a gatekeeper, but show who we are.

34:34.480 --> 34:40.240
 You were also, it's interesting because one of the problems of the internet of having

34:40.240 --> 34:47.600
 so much information is it's actually the curation, the human curation is still the powerful,

34:47.600 --> 34:48.600
 beautiful thing.

34:48.600 --> 34:49.600
 Yes.

34:49.600 --> 34:54.080
 So what you did with the record is actually, is exactly the right process.

34:54.080 --> 34:58.400
 It's kind of boiling down a massive amount of possibilities of what you could send into

34:58.400 --> 35:05.180
 something that represents, you know, the better angels of our nature or represents our humanity.

35:05.180 --> 35:11.560
 So if you think about, you know, what would you send from the internet as opposed to sending

35:11.560 --> 35:17.840
 all of Wikipedia, for example, all human knowledge, is there something just new that we've developed,

35:17.840 --> 35:24.440
 you think, or fundamentally we're still the same kind of human species?

35:24.440 --> 35:32.280
 I think fundamentally we're the same, but we have advanced to an astonishing degree

35:32.280 --> 35:37.680
 in our capacity for data retrieval and for transmission.

35:37.680 --> 35:41.960
 And so, you know, I would send YouTube, I would send, you know, really like think of

35:41.960 --> 35:52.920
 all the, you know, I still feel so lucky that there's any great musical artist of the last

35:52.920 --> 36:00.120
 hundred years who I revere, I can just find them and watch them and listen to them.

36:00.120 --> 36:02.000
 And you know, that's fantastic.

36:02.000 --> 36:09.880
 I also love how democratic it is that we each become curators and that we each decide those

36:09.880 --> 36:10.880
 things.

36:10.880 --> 36:18.000
 Now, I may not agree with, you know, the choices that everyone makes, but of course not because

36:18.000 --> 36:19.040
 that's not the point.

36:19.040 --> 36:26.560
 The point is, is that we are, you know, we have discovered largely through the internet

36:26.560 --> 36:33.600
 that we are an intercommunicating organism and that can only be good.

36:33.600 --> 36:36.680
 So you could also send now, Cosmos.

36:36.680 --> 36:38.960
 Yes, I'd love to.

36:38.960 --> 36:40.440
 I would be proud to.

36:40.440 --> 36:49.560
 I mean, you've spoken about a very specific voice that Cosmos had in that it reveals the

36:49.560 --> 36:50.560
 magic of science.

36:50.560 --> 36:56.480
 I think you said shamanic journey of it and not the details of the latest breakthroughs

36:56.480 --> 36:57.680
 or so on.

36:57.680 --> 36:58.680
 Just revealing the magic.

36:58.680 --> 37:07.320
 Can you try to describe what this voice of Cosmos is with the follow up and the new Cosmos

37:07.320 --> 37:09.120
 that you're working on now?

37:09.120 --> 37:18.040
 Yes, well, the dream of Cosmos is really like Einstein's quote, you know, it's the idea

37:18.040 --> 37:25.400
 of the awesome power of science to be in absolutely everyone's hands.

37:25.400 --> 37:27.880
 You know, it belongs to all of us.

37:27.880 --> 37:31.800
 It's not the preserve of a priesthood.

37:31.800 --> 37:37.800
 It's just the community of science is becoming more diverse and being less exclusive than

37:37.800 --> 37:41.600
 it was guilty of in the not so recent past.

37:41.600 --> 37:50.580
 The discoveries of science, our understanding of the Cosmos that we live in has really grown

37:50.580 --> 37:58.880
 by leaps and bounds and probably we've learned more in the last hundred years about it.

37:58.880 --> 38:04.360
 You know, the tempo of discovery has picked up so rapidly.

38:04.360 --> 38:13.040
 And so the idea of Cosmos from the 1970s when Carl and I and Steven Soder, another astronomer,

38:13.040 --> 38:23.240
 first imagined it was that interweaving not only of the scientific concepts and revelations

38:23.240 --> 38:31.960
 and using, you know, cinematic VFX to take the viewer on this transporting, uplifting

38:31.960 --> 38:36.520
 journey but also the stories of the searchers.

38:36.520 --> 38:44.600
 Because the more I have learned about, you know, the process of science through my life

38:44.600 --> 38:54.240
 with Carl and sense, the more I am really persuaded that it's that adherence to the

38:54.240 --> 39:02.320
 facts and to that adherence to that little approximation, that little bit of reality

39:02.320 --> 39:08.960
 that we've been able to get our hands around is something that we desperately need and

39:08.960 --> 39:11.400
 it doesn't matter if you are a scientist.

39:11.400 --> 39:15.960
 In fact, the people, it matters even more if you're not.

39:15.960 --> 39:23.920
 And since, you know, the level of science teaching has been fairly or unfairly maligned

39:23.920 --> 39:30.520
 and the idea that once there was such a thing as a television network, which of course has

39:30.520 --> 39:37.280
 now evolved into many other things, the idea that you could in the most democratic way

39:37.280 --> 39:44.000
 make accessible to absolutely everyone and most especially people who don't even realize

39:44.000 --> 39:50.840
 that they have an interest in a subject or who feel so intimidated by the jargon of science

39:50.840 --> 39:54.800
 and its kind of exclusive history.

39:54.800 --> 40:01.860
 The idea that we could do this and, you know, in season two of Cosmos, the Space Time Odyssey,

40:01.860 --> 40:06.440
 we were in 181 countries in the space of two weeks.

40:06.440 --> 40:13.920
 It was the largest rollout in television history, which is really amazing for a, there is no

40:13.920 --> 40:15.240
 science based programming.

40:15.240 --> 40:20.800
 By the way, just to clarify, the series was rolled out, so it was shown in not that many

40:20.800 --> 40:21.800
 countries.

40:21.800 --> 40:22.800
 You said we were in.

40:22.800 --> 40:25.800
 Well, our show was in 180 countries.

40:25.800 --> 40:27.280
 Yeah, the show, which is incredible.

40:27.280 --> 40:31.760
 I mean, the hundreds of millions, whatever that number is, the people that watched it,

40:31.760 --> 40:33.560
 it's just, it's crazy.

40:33.560 --> 40:43.440
 It's so crazy that, for instance, my son had a cerebral hemorrhage a year ago and the doctor

40:43.440 --> 40:50.920
 who saved his life in a very dangerous situation.

40:50.920 --> 40:59.560
 When he realized that, you know, that Sam and I were who we were, he said, that's why

40:59.560 --> 41:00.560
 I'm here.

41:00.560 --> 41:06.080
 You know, he said, if you come of age in a poor country like Colombia and Carl Sagan

41:06.080 --> 41:13.440
 calls you to science when you're a child, then, then, you know, you go to medicine because

41:13.440 --> 41:17.840
 that's the only avenue open to you, but that's why I'm here.

41:17.840 --> 41:24.520
 And I've heard that story and I hear that story, I think every week.

41:24.520 --> 41:26.120
 How does that make you feel?

41:26.120 --> 41:31.520
 I mean, the number of scientists, I mean, a lot of it is quiet, right?

41:31.520 --> 41:36.160
 But the number of scientists Cosmos has created is just countless.

41:36.160 --> 41:40.520
 I mean, it probably touched a lot of, I don't know, probably it could be a crazy number

41:40.520 --> 41:43.760
 of the 90% of scientists or something that have been.

41:43.760 --> 41:50.240
 I would love to do that census because I, because that's the greatest gratification,

41:50.240 --> 41:52.200
 because that's the dream of science.

41:52.200 --> 41:58.360
 That's the whole idea is that if it belongs to all of us and not just a tiny few, then

41:58.360 --> 42:03.240
 we have some chance of determining how it's used.

42:03.240 --> 42:11.320
 And if it's only in the hands of people whose only, whose only interests are the balance

42:11.320 --> 42:20.240
 sheet or hegemony over other nations or things like that, then it'll probably end up being

42:20.240 --> 42:22.880
 a gun aimed at our heads.

42:22.880 --> 42:30.640
 But if it's distributed in the widest possible way, a capability that we now have because

42:30.640 --> 42:38.160
 of our technology, then the chance is that it will be used with wisdom.

42:38.160 --> 42:39.160
 That's the dream of it.

42:39.160 --> 42:42.960
 So that's why we did the first Cosmos.

42:42.960 --> 42:48.840
 We wanted to take not just, as I say, the scientific information, but also tell the

42:48.840 --> 42:53.000
 stories of these searchers.

42:53.000 --> 43:03.280
 Because for us, and for me, carrying on this series in the second and third seasons, the

43:03.280 --> 43:09.280
 primary interest was that we wouldn't tell a story unless it was a kind of a threefer.

43:09.280 --> 43:17.560
 It was not just a way to understand a new scientific idea, but it was also a way to

43:17.560 --> 43:24.880
 understand what, if it matters what's true, how the world can change for us and how we

43:24.880 --> 43:27.400
 can be protected.

43:27.400 --> 43:33.200
 And if it doesn't matter what's true, then we're in grave danger because we have the

43:33.200 --> 43:41.280
 capability to not only destroy ourselves and our civilization, but to take so many species

43:41.280 --> 43:42.280
 with us.

43:42.280 --> 43:48.560
 And I'd like to talk to you about that particular, sort of the dangers of ourselves in a little

43:48.560 --> 43:51.760
 bit, but sort of to linger on Cosmos.

43:51.760 --> 44:00.360
 Maybe for the first, the 1980 and the 2014 follow up, what's a, or one of the, or several

44:00.360 --> 44:07.160
 memorable moments from the creation of either of those seasons?

44:07.160 --> 44:14.760
 Well, you know, the critical thing really was the fact that Seth MacFarlane became art

44:14.760 --> 44:21.560
 champion because I had been with three colleagues, I had been schlepping around from network

44:21.560 --> 44:29.200
 to network with a treatment for Cosmos and every network said they wanted to do it, but

44:29.200 --> 44:34.680
 they wouldn't give me creative control and they wouldn't give me enough money to make

44:34.680 --> 44:40.680
 it cinematic and to make it feel like you're really going on an adventure.

44:40.680 --> 44:45.200
 And so I think both of those things, sorry to interrupt, both of those things are given

44:45.200 --> 44:52.000
 what Cosmos represents, the legacy of it and the legacy of Carl Sagan is essential control,

44:52.000 --> 44:54.160
 especially in the modern world.

44:54.160 --> 44:58.000
 It's wonderful that you sought control, that you did not really push it.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
 And I kept saying no.

44:59.000 --> 45:04.040
 And my partners, I'm sure, you know, they would look at me like I was nuts, you know,

45:04.040 --> 45:08.160
 and they probably must have entertained the idea that maybe I didn't really want to do

45:08.160 --> 45:12.360
 it, you know, because I was afraid or something, but I kept saying no.

45:12.360 --> 45:21.160
 And it wasn't until I met Seth MacFarlane and he took me to Fox and to Peter Rice and

45:21.160 --> 45:25.920
 said, you know, I'll pay for half the pilot if I have to, you know, and Peter Rice was

45:25.920 --> 45:27.680
 like, put your money away.

45:27.680 --> 45:39.080
 And in every time since, in the 10 years since, at every turn, when we needed Seth to intervene

45:39.080 --> 45:43.560
 on our behalf, he stood up and he did it.

45:43.560 --> 45:51.760
 And so that was like, in a way, that is the watershed for me of everything that followed

45:51.760 --> 45:52.760
 since.

45:52.760 --> 45:58.960
 And I was so lucky because, you know, Steve Soder and I written the original Cosmos with

45:58.960 --> 46:04.080
 Carl and collaborated on the treatment for season two.

46:04.080 --> 46:13.120
 And then Brennan Braga came into our project at the perfect moment and has proven to be

46:13.120 --> 46:17.160
 just the, really, I have been so lucky my whole life.

46:17.160 --> 46:23.760
 I've collaborated, I've been lucky with the people, my collaborators have been extraordinary.

46:23.760 --> 46:26.200
 And so that was a critical thing.

46:26.200 --> 46:33.560
 But also to have, you know, for instance, our astonishing VFX supervisor who comes from

46:33.560 --> 46:39.840
 the movies, who heads the global association of VFX people, Jeff Okun.

46:39.840 --> 46:46.680
 And then, you know, I could rattle off 10 more names, I'd be happy to do that.

46:46.680 --> 46:49.720
 And it was that collaboration.

46:49.720 --> 46:52.440
 So the people were essential to the creation of...

46:52.440 --> 46:53.440
 Absolutely.

46:53.440 --> 46:58.240
 I mean, when it came down, I have to say that when it came down to the vision of what the

46:58.240 --> 47:04.000
 series would be, that was me sitting in my home, looking out the window and, you know,

47:04.000 --> 47:06.720
 really imagining like what I wanted to do.

47:06.720 --> 47:07.960
 Can you pause on that for a second?

47:07.960 --> 47:08.960
 Like what's that process?

47:08.960 --> 47:13.240
 Because it, you know, Cosmos is also, it's grounded in science, of course, but it's also

47:13.240 --> 47:19.440
 incredibly imaginative and the words used are carefully crafted.

47:19.440 --> 47:20.440
 Thank you.

47:20.440 --> 47:21.440
 So what's...

47:21.440 --> 47:28.480
 If you can talk about the process of that, the big picture, imaginative thinking, and

47:28.480 --> 47:35.320
 sort of the rigorous crafting of words that like basically turns into something like poetry.

47:35.320 --> 47:37.520
 Thank you so much.

47:37.520 --> 47:44.120
 For me, these are rare occasions for human self esteem.

47:44.120 --> 47:55.040
 The scientists that we bring to life in Cosmos are people, in my view, who have everything

47:55.040 --> 48:00.520
 we need to see us through this current crisis.

48:00.520 --> 48:09.840
 They're, very often they come, they're poor, they're female, they're outsiders who are

48:09.840 --> 48:19.080
 not expected to have gifts that are so prodigious, but they persevere.

48:19.080 --> 48:26.100
 And so you have someone like Michael Faraday, who comes from a family, dysfunctional family

48:26.100 --> 48:33.920
 of like 14 people and, you know, it never goes to, university never learns the math.

48:33.920 --> 48:42.080
 But, you know, is the, you know, there's Einstein years later looking up at the picture of Faraday

48:42.080 --> 48:44.240
 to inspire him.

48:44.240 --> 48:54.120
 So it's, you know, if we had people with that kind of humility and unselfishness who didn't

48:54.120 --> 49:02.120
 want to patent everything, as, you know, Michael Faraday created the wealth of the 20th century

49:02.120 --> 49:05.080
 with his various inventions.

49:05.080 --> 49:09.520
 And yet he never took out a single patent at a time when people were patenting everything

49:09.520 --> 49:13.080
 because that was not what he was about.

49:13.080 --> 49:20.600
 And to me, that's a kind of almost a saintliness that says that, you know, here's a man who

49:20.600 --> 49:28.120
 finds in his life, this tremendous gratification from searching.

49:28.120 --> 49:30.760
 And it's just so impressive to me.

49:30.760 --> 49:34.840
 And there are so many other people in Cosmos, especially the new season of Cosmos, which

49:34.840 --> 49:36.320
 is called Possible Worlds.

49:36.320 --> 49:37.880
 Possible, beautiful title.

49:37.880 --> 49:44.520
 Possible Worlds, well, I stole it from an author and a scientist from the 1940s.

49:44.520 --> 49:53.640
 But it, for me, encapsulates not just, you know, the exoplanets that we've begun to discover,

49:53.640 --> 50:00.620
 not just, you know, the worlds that we might visit, but also the world that this could

50:00.620 --> 50:03.360
 be, a hopeful vision of the future.

50:03.360 --> 50:08.500
 You asked me what is common to all three seasons of Cosmos or what is that voice?

50:08.500 --> 50:10.720
 It's a voice of hope.

50:10.720 --> 50:17.820
 It's a voice that says there is a future which we bring to life in, I think, a fairly dazzling

50:17.820 --> 50:21.920
 fashion that we can still have, you know?

50:21.920 --> 50:27.080
 And in sitting down to imagine what this season would be, the new season would be, I'm sitting

50:27.080 --> 50:35.560
 where I live in Ithaca, beautiful, just gorgeous place, trees everywhere, waterfalls, I'm sitting

50:35.560 --> 50:41.600
 there thinking, well, you know, you can't, how do you, how do you awaken people?

50:41.600 --> 50:45.920
 I mean, you can't yell at them and say we're all going to die, you know?

50:45.920 --> 50:47.380
 It doesn't help.

50:47.380 --> 50:49.220
 It doesn't help.

50:49.220 --> 50:59.360
 But I think if you give them a vision of the future that's not pie in the sky, but something,

50:59.360 --> 51:06.840
 ways in which science can be redemptive, can actually remediate our future.

51:06.840 --> 51:15.640
 We have those capabilities right now, as well as the capabilities to do things in the Cosmos

51:15.640 --> 51:19.040
 that we could be doing right now, but we're not doing them.

51:19.040 --> 51:24.640
 Not because we don't know how to, how, you know, with the engineering or the material

51:24.640 --> 51:30.880
 sciences or the physics, we know all we need to know, but we're a little bit paralyzed

51:30.880 --> 51:33.120
 in some sense.

51:33.120 --> 51:39.080
 And you know, we're like, I always think we're like the toddler, you know, like we, we left

51:39.080 --> 51:43.560
 our mother's legs, you know, and scurried out to the moon.

51:43.560 --> 51:46.440
 And we had a moment of, wow, we can do this.

51:46.440 --> 51:51.920
 And then we realized, and somehow we had a failure of nerve and we went scurrying back

51:51.920 --> 51:56.800
 to our mother and, you know, did things that really weren't going to get us out there,

51:56.800 --> 52:02.440
 like the space shuttle, things like that, because it was a kind of failure of nerve.

52:02.440 --> 52:07.080
 So Cosmos is about overcoming those fears.

52:07.080 --> 52:12.360
 We're now as a civilization, ready to be a teenager venturing out into college.

52:12.360 --> 52:13.840
 We're returning back.

52:13.840 --> 52:14.840
 Exactly.

52:14.840 --> 52:15.840
 Exactly.

52:15.840 --> 52:25.640
 And that's one of my theories about our current situation is that this is our adolescence.

52:25.640 --> 52:28.400
 And I was a total mess as an adolescent.

52:28.400 --> 52:31.520
 I was reckless, irresponsible, totally.

52:31.520 --> 52:34.160
 I didn't, I was inconsiderate.

52:34.160 --> 52:41.520
 I, the reality of other people's feelings and the future didn't exist for me.

52:41.520 --> 52:46.800
 So why should a technologically adolescent civilization be any different?

52:46.800 --> 52:55.880
 But you know, the vast majority of people I know made it through that period and went

52:55.880 --> 52:59.640
 on to be more wise.

52:59.640 --> 53:02.840
 And that's what my hope is for our civilization.

53:02.840 --> 53:10.600
 On a sort of a darker and more difficult subject in terms of, so you just talked about the

53:10.600 --> 53:18.880
 Cosmos being an inspiration for science and for us growing out of our messy adolescence,

53:18.880 --> 53:22.200
 but nevertheless, there is threats in this world.

53:22.200 --> 53:25.400
 So do you worry about existential threats?

53:25.400 --> 53:30.040
 Like you mentioned nuclear weapons, do you worry about nuclear war?

53:30.040 --> 53:31.040
 Yes.

53:31.040 --> 53:34.680
 And if you could also maybe comment, I don't know how much you've thought about it, but

53:34.680 --> 53:40.840
 there's folks like Elon Musk who are worried about the existential threats of artificial

53:40.840 --> 53:41.840
 intelligence.

53:41.840 --> 53:49.400
 Sort of our robotic computer creations sort of resulting in us humans losing control.

53:49.400 --> 53:54.240
 So can you speak to the things that worry you in terms of existential concerns?

53:54.240 --> 53:55.240
 All of the above.

53:55.240 --> 54:00.720
 You don't have to be silly, you know, like not to think and not to look at, for instance,

54:00.720 --> 54:09.360
 our rapidly burgeoning capability in artificial intelligence.

54:09.360 --> 54:16.920
 And to see how sick so much of the planet is not to be concerned.

54:16.920 --> 54:18.920
 And sick is an evil potentially.

54:18.920 --> 54:25.760
 Well, how much cruelty and brutality is happening at this very moment?

54:25.760 --> 54:32.640
 And I would put climate change higher up on that list, because I believe that there are

54:32.640 --> 54:39.600
 unforeseen discoveries that we are making right now, for instance, all that methane

54:39.600 --> 54:47.480
 that's coming out of the ocean floor that was sequestered because of the permafrost,

54:47.480 --> 54:49.560
 which is now melting.

54:49.560 --> 54:56.840
 You know, I think there are other effects besides our greed and short term thinking

54:56.840 --> 55:02.580
 that we are triggering now with all the greenhouse gases we're putting into the atmosphere.

55:02.580 --> 55:04.160
 And that worries me day and night.

55:04.160 --> 55:10.440
 I think about it every single, every moment, really, because I really think that's how

55:10.440 --> 55:11.440
 we have to be.

55:11.440 --> 55:23.600
 We have to begin to really focus on how grave the challenge is to our civilization and to

55:23.600 --> 55:26.680
 the other species that are.

55:26.680 --> 55:31.160
 It's a mass, this is a mass extinction event that we're living through.

55:31.160 --> 55:32.760
 And we're seeing it.

55:32.760 --> 55:35.160
 We're seeing news of it every day.

55:35.160 --> 55:40.760
 So what do you think about another touchy subject, but what do you think about the politicization

55:40.760 --> 55:46.400
 of science on topics like global warming and bionic stem cell research and other topics

55:46.400 --> 55:47.560
 like it?

55:47.560 --> 55:48.560
 What's your sense?

55:48.560 --> 55:49.560
 Why?

55:49.560 --> 55:53.200
 What do you mean by the politicization of global warming?

55:53.200 --> 56:00.000
 Meaning that if you say, I think what you just said, which is a global warming is a

56:00.000 --> 56:05.160
 serious concern, it's human caused and maybe some detrimental effects.

56:05.160 --> 56:10.960
 Certainly there's a large percent of the population of the United States that would, as opposed

56:10.960 --> 56:20.160
 to listening to that statement, would immediately think, oh, that's just a liberal talking point.

56:20.160 --> 56:21.160
 That's what I mean by politicization.

56:21.160 --> 56:22.240
 I think that's not so true anymore.

56:22.240 --> 56:30.120
 I don't think our problem is a population that's skeptical about climate change because

56:30.120 --> 56:37.240
 I think that the extreme weather and fire events that we are experiencing with such

56:37.240 --> 56:40.720
 frequency is really gotten to people.

56:40.720 --> 56:50.400
 I think that there are people in leadership positions who choose to ignore it and to pretend

56:50.400 --> 56:55.640
 it's not there, but ultimately I think they will be rejected.

56:55.640 --> 57:00.520
 The question is, will it be fast enough?

57:00.520 --> 57:09.120
 I think actually that most people have really finally taken the reality of global climate

57:09.120 --> 57:16.320
 change to heart and they look at their children and grandchildren and they don't feel good

57:16.320 --> 57:24.860
 because they come from a world which was in many ways, in terms of climate, fairly familiar

57:24.860 --> 57:29.920
 and benign and they know that we're headed in another direction and it's not just that,

57:29.920 --> 57:35.480
 it's what we do to the oceans, the rivers, the air.

57:35.480 --> 57:40.240
 You ask me, what is the message of cosmos?

57:40.240 --> 57:46.960
 It's that we have to think in longer terms.

57:46.960 --> 57:50.960
 I think of the Soviet Union and the United States in the Cold War and they're ready to

57:50.960 --> 57:57.560
 kill each other over these two different views of the distribution of resources.

57:57.560 --> 58:05.200
 But neither of them has a form of human social organization that thinks in terms of a hundred

58:05.200 --> 58:11.800
 years, let alone a thousand years, which are the time scales that science speaks in.

58:11.800 --> 58:19.200
 And that's part of the problem is that we have to get a grip on reality and where we're

58:19.200 --> 58:30.560
 headed and I'm not fatalistic at all, but I do feel like, and in setting out to do this

58:30.560 --> 58:37.880
 series each season, we were talking about climate change in the original cosmos in episode

58:37.880 --> 58:46.120
 four and warning about inadvertent climate modification in 1980.

58:46.120 --> 58:52.160
 And of course, Carl did his PhD thesis on the greenhouse effect on Venus and he was

58:52.160 --> 58:58.200
 painfully cognizant of what a runaway greenhouse effect would do to our planet.

58:58.200 --> 59:02.880
 And not only that, but the climatic history of the planet, which we go into in great detail

59:02.880 --> 59:03.880
 in the series.

59:03.880 --> 59:11.760
 So yeah, I mean, how are we going to get a grip on this if not through some kind of understanding

59:11.760 --> 59:12.760
 of science?

59:12.760 --> 59:22.320
 Can I just say one more thing about science is that its powers of prophecy are astonishing.

59:22.320 --> 59:32.280
 You launch a spacecraft in 1977 and you know where each and every planet in the solar system

59:32.280 --> 59:39.800
 is going to be and every moon and you rendezvous with that flawlessly and you exceed the design

59:39.800 --> 59:44.840
 specifications of the greatest dreams of the engineers.

59:44.840 --> 59:51.920
 And then you go on to explore the Milky Way galaxy and you do it, I mean, you know, the

59:51.920 --> 59:59.240
 climate scientists, some of the people whose stories we tell in cosmos, their predictions

59:59.240 --> 1:00:08.240
 were, and they were working with very early computer modeling capabilities, they have

1:00:08.240 --> 1:00:12.800
 proven to be so robust, nuclear winter, all of these things.

1:00:12.800 --> 1:00:19.720
 This is a prophetic power and yet how crazy that, you know, it's like the Romans with

1:00:19.720 --> 1:00:26.640
 their lead cooking pots and their lead pipes or the Aztecs ripping out their own people's

1:00:26.640 --> 1:00:27.640
 hearts.

1:00:27.640 --> 1:00:28.800
 This is us.

1:00:28.800 --> 1:00:35.240
 We know better and yet we are acting as if it's business as usual.

1:00:35.240 --> 1:00:45.160
 Yeah, the beautiful complexity of human nature, speaking of which, let me ask a tough question

1:00:45.160 --> 1:00:49.960
 I guess because there's so many possible answers, but what aspect of life here on earth do you

1:00:49.960 --> 1:00:55.920
 find most fascinating from the origin of life, the evolutionary process itself, the origin

1:00:55.920 --> 1:01:02.560
 of the human mind, so intelligence, some of the technological developments going on now

1:01:02.560 --> 1:01:07.600
 or us venturing out into space or space exploration, what just inspires you?

1:01:07.600 --> 1:01:09.280
 Oh, they all inspire me.

1:01:09.280 --> 1:01:14.280
 Every one of those inspire me, but I have to say that to me at the origin of, as I've

1:01:14.280 --> 1:01:22.960
 gotten older, to me, the origin of life has become less interesting because I feel, well,

1:01:22.960 --> 1:01:31.640
 not because it's more, I think I understand, I have a better grasp of how it might've happened.

1:01:31.640 --> 1:01:33.280
 Do you think it was a huge leap?

1:01:33.280 --> 1:01:42.560
 I think it was a, we are a byproduct of geophysics and I think it's not, my suspicion of course,

1:01:42.560 --> 1:01:50.520
 which is take it with a grain of salt, but my suspicion is that it happens more often

1:01:50.520 --> 1:01:56.840
 and more places than we like to think because after all the history of our thinking about

1:01:56.840 --> 1:02:04.360
 ourselves has been a constant series of demotions in which we've had to realize, no, no, so

1:02:04.360 --> 1:02:05.360
 to me that's...

1:02:05.360 --> 1:02:06.360
 We're not at the center of the solar system.

1:02:06.360 --> 1:02:12.800
 And the origin of consciousness is to me also not so amazing if you think of it as going

1:02:12.800 --> 1:02:22.400
 back to these one celled organisms of a billion years ago who had to know, well, if I go higher

1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:30.480
 up, I'll get too much sun and if I go lower down, I'll be protected from UV rays, things

1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:31.480
 like that.

1:02:31.480 --> 1:02:34.320
 They had to know that or you, I eat, me, I don't.

1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:41.440
 I mean, even that, I can see if you know that, then knowing what we know now, it's just,

1:02:41.440 --> 1:02:43.680
 it's not so hard to fathom.

1:02:43.680 --> 1:02:50.960
 It seems like, I've never believed there was a duality between our minds and our bodies

1:02:50.960 --> 1:02:57.360
 and I think that even consciousness, all those interesting things seem to me, except one

1:02:57.360 --> 1:02:58.360
 of the things...

1:02:58.360 --> 1:02:59.360
 A byproduct of geophysics.

1:02:59.360 --> 1:03:07.040
 Yeah, all of chemistry, yes, geochemistry, geophysics, absolutely.

1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:12.440
 It makes perfect sense to me and it doesn't make it any less wondrous.

1:03:12.440 --> 1:03:19.320
 It doesn't rob it at all of the wonder of it.

1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:21.600
 And so, yeah, I think that's amazing.

1:03:21.600 --> 1:03:27.180
 I think we tell the story of someone you have never heard of, I guarantee, and I think you're

1:03:27.180 --> 1:03:34.560
 very knowledgeable on the subject, who was more responsible for our ability to venture

1:03:34.560 --> 1:03:40.680
 out to other worlds than anyone else and who was completely forgotten.

1:03:40.680 --> 1:03:44.400
 And so, those are the kinds of stories I like best for Cosmos because...

1:03:44.400 --> 1:03:45.400
 Can you tell me who?

1:03:45.400 --> 1:03:53.640
 No, I'm going to make you watch this series, I'm going to make you buy my book, but I'm

1:03:53.640 --> 1:04:03.280
 just saying, this person would be forgotten, but the way that we do Cosmos is that I ask

1:04:03.280 --> 1:04:08.620
 a question to myself, I really want to get to the bottom to the answer and keep going

1:04:08.620 --> 1:04:14.800
 deeper, deeper until we find what the story is, a story that I know because I'm not a

1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:15.800
 scientist.

1:04:15.800 --> 1:04:22.480
 If it moves me, if it moves me, then I want to tell it and other people will be moved.

1:04:22.480 --> 1:04:28.760
 Do you ponder mortality, human mortality, and maybe even your own mortality?

1:04:28.760 --> 1:04:30.360
 Oh, all the time.

1:04:30.360 --> 1:04:34.080
 I just turned 70, so yeah, I think about it a lot.

1:04:34.080 --> 1:04:37.520
 I mean, it's, you know, how can you not think about it?

1:04:37.520 --> 1:04:48.120
 What do you make of this short life of ours, I mean, let me ask a sort of another way,

1:04:48.120 --> 1:04:58.520
 you've lost Carl, and speaking of mortality, if you could be, if you could choose immortality,

1:04:58.520 --> 1:05:02.520
 you know, it's possible that science allows us to live much, much longer.

1:05:02.520 --> 1:05:05.800
 Is that something you would choose for yourself, for Carl, for you?

1:05:05.800 --> 1:05:07.080
 Well, for Carl, definitely.

1:05:07.080 --> 1:05:12.400
 I would have, you know, in a nanosecond, I would take that deal.

1:05:12.400 --> 1:05:13.400
 But not for me.

1:05:13.400 --> 1:05:17.880
 I mean, if Carl were alive, yes, I would want to live forever because I know it would be

1:05:17.880 --> 1:05:18.880
 fun.

1:05:18.880 --> 1:05:19.880
 But no.

1:05:19.880 --> 1:05:20.880
 Would it be fun forever?

1:05:20.880 --> 1:05:21.880
 I don't know.

1:05:21.880 --> 1:05:22.880
 That's the essential nature of the...

1:05:22.880 --> 1:05:23.880
 I don't know.

1:05:23.880 --> 1:05:29.000
 It's just that the universe is so full of so many wonderful things to discover that

1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:31.560
 it feels like it would be fun.

1:05:31.560 --> 1:05:33.120
 But no, I don't want to live forever.

1:05:33.120 --> 1:05:37.160
 I have had a magical life.

1:05:37.160 --> 1:05:42.000
 I just, you know, my craziest dreams have come true.

1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:54.040
 And I feel, you know, forgive me, but this crazy quirk of fate that put my most joyful,

1:05:54.040 --> 1:06:00.760
 deepest feelings, feelings that decades later, 42 years later, I know how real, how true

1:06:00.760 --> 1:06:02.880
 those feelings were.

1:06:02.880 --> 1:06:09.960
 Everything that happened after that was an affirmation of how true those feelings were.

1:06:09.960 --> 1:06:12.080
 And so, I don't feel that way.

1:06:12.080 --> 1:06:20.880
 I feel like I have gotten so much more than my share, not just my extraordinary life with

1:06:20.880 --> 1:06:31.120
 Carl, my family, my parents, my children, my friends, the places that I've been able

1:06:31.120 --> 1:06:36.920
 to explore, the books I've read, the music I've heard.

1:06:36.920 --> 1:06:44.440
 So I feel like, you know, if it would be much better if instead of working on the immortality

1:06:44.440 --> 1:06:51.020
 of the lucky few of the most privileged people in this society, I would really like to see

1:06:51.020 --> 1:06:55.940
 a concerted effort for us to get our act together, you know?

1:06:55.940 --> 1:07:04.800
 That to me is topic A, more pressing, you know, this possible world, that is the challenge.

1:07:04.800 --> 1:07:11.000
 And we're at a kind of moment where if we can make that choice.

1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:14.080
 So immortality doesn't really interest me.

1:07:14.080 --> 1:07:23.600
 I really, I love nature and I have to say that because I'm a product of nature, I recognize

1:07:23.600 --> 1:07:27.960
 that it's great gifts and it's great cruelty.

1:07:27.960 --> 1:07:33.960
 Well, I don't think there's a better way to end it, and thank you so much for talking

1:07:33.960 --> 1:07:34.960
 to us.

1:07:34.960 --> 1:07:35.960
 It was an honor.

1:07:35.960 --> 1:07:36.960
 Oh, it's wonderful.

1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:37.960
 I really appreciate it.

1:07:37.960 --> 1:07:38.960
 I really enjoyed it.

1:07:38.960 --> 1:07:39.960
 I thought your questions were great.

1:07:39.960 --> 1:07:40.960
 Thank you.

 And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom from Carl Sagan.

1:08:14.160 --> 1:08:17.120
 What an astonishing thing a book is.

1:08:17.120 --> 1:08:23.040
 It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny

1:08:23.040 --> 1:08:24.360
 dark squiggles.

1:08:24.360 --> 1:08:29.760
 But one glance at it, and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead

1:08:29.760 --> 1:08:32.080
 for thousands of years.

1:08:32.080 --> 1:08:37.880
 Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly

1:08:37.880 --> 1:08:39.760
 to you.

1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:43.440
 Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions.

1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:50.460
 Finding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs.

1:08:50.460 --> 1:08:53.080
 Books break the shackles of time.

1:08:53.080 --> 1:08:59.640
 A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.

1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:13.760
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
