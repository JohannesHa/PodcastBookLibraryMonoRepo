00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
 The following is a conversation with Michael Mallis and Yaron Brook, Michael's third time

00:05.680 --> 00:11.640
 on this podcast and Yaron's second, but together for the first time.

00:11.640 --> 00:18.280
 Michael is an anarchist, political thinker, host of a podcast called You're Welcome and

00:18.280 --> 00:25.220
 author of Dear Reader, The New Right and two upcoming books Anarchist Handbook and The

00:25.220 --> 00:26.680
 White Pill.

00:26.680 --> 00:33.800
 Yaron is an objectivist philosopher, chairman of the Ayn Rand Institute, host of The Yaron

00:33.800 --> 00:41.200
 Brook Show and coauthor of The Free Market Revolution and Equal is Unfair.

00:41.200 --> 00:48.400
 Quick mention of our sponsors, Ground News, Public Goods, Athletic Greens, Brave and Four

00:48.400 --> 00:49.560
 Sigmatic.

00:49.560 --> 00:53.160
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:53.160 --> 00:58.380
 As a side note, let me say that this conversation is a kind of experiment.

00:58.380 --> 01:03.840
 Both Michael and Yaron are thoughtful and passionate, united in part by an interest

01:03.840 --> 01:09.600
 in the history and philosophy of Ayn Rand, but they are also very different in style.

01:09.600 --> 01:16.440
 Good conversation, like good food, is often made delicious by pairing of contrasting elements.

01:16.440 --> 01:22.900
 For example, someone suggested I try a peanut butter, bacon and banana sandwich, which apparently

01:22.900 --> 01:24.640
 is very good.

01:24.640 --> 01:28.240
 Among the three of us, I don't know who's the peanut butter, who's the bacon and who's

01:28.240 --> 01:34.880
 the banana, I'm guessing it's probably me, I'm the banana, but I hope the final result,

01:34.880 --> 01:38.680
 the final dish, if you will, is equally delicious.

01:38.680 --> 01:44.800
 We talk through, I think, a lot of interesting ideas, sometimes disagreeing, sometimes even

01:44.800 --> 01:51.000
 in rare cases saying something humorous, including dark humor, especially in Michael's case.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.760
 All three of us are sensitive to the suffering in the world today and throughout human history.

01:55.760 --> 02:00.520
 We think about it, we talk about it, and we deal with it in different ways.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.200
 Be patient with us.

02:02.200 --> 02:07.280
 Whether you agree, disagree, enjoy or dislike the result, I hope you feel listened, you're

02:07.280 --> 02:10.960
 a wiser person on the other end of it, I know I was.

02:10.960 --> 02:17.280
 Mostly, I really enjoyed this conversation because no matter what Michael and Yaron believe,

02:17.280 --> 02:22.600
 underneath it all, they're genuine, kind human beings that I'm lucky to be able to

02:22.600 --> 02:25.420
 hang out with and learn from.

02:25.420 --> 02:31.480
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast and here's my conversation with Michael Malus and Yaron

02:31.480 --> 02:32.480
 Rook.

02:32.480 --> 02:36.800
 I've been a huge fan of the two of you for the longest time.

02:36.800 --> 02:37.800
 Are we recording now?

02:37.800 --> 02:38.800
 Is it starting?

02:38.800 --> 02:39.800
 Or are you just talking?

02:39.800 --> 02:40.800
 I'm not recording at all.

02:40.800 --> 02:43.320
 He's not going to compliment us if it's not part of the show.

02:43.320 --> 02:44.320
 Yes, he does, all the time.

02:44.320 --> 02:45.320
 He speaks very highly of me.

02:45.320 --> 02:46.320
 You, I don't know.

02:46.320 --> 02:47.320
 I'm not sure.

02:47.320 --> 02:48.320
 He only does this to me on the show.

02:48.320 --> 02:53.120
 Objectivists don't like charity, so don't compliment him, he won't think it's sincere.

02:53.120 --> 02:57.360
 So it's an incredible honor that the both of you would show up here.

02:57.360 --> 03:01.600
 If we, let me just ask this sort of profound philosophical question.

03:01.600 --> 03:05.600
 How well do you think we would get along if we were stuck on a desert island together?

03:05.600 --> 03:07.440
 What would life be like?

03:07.440 --> 03:12.100
 I thought the original question you had, that you sent us this question, was how long would

03:12.100 --> 03:13.960
 it take for us to murder one another or something like that.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.600
 There was murder in the question, if I remember.

03:15.600 --> 03:18.600
 I, I, listen, he sent us homework, right?

03:18.600 --> 03:19.600
 All these questions.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.600
 I ignored it.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.720
 I didn't spend four years at Patrick Henry University to do homework.

03:23.720 --> 03:29.160
 To answer your question, I think it would be very easy for us to live together in a

03:29.160 --> 03:30.860
 desert island in terms of interpersonal.

03:30.860 --> 03:34.500
 I know, and I say this because I know a lot of people who have been the show's survivor.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.920
 So they, and I know a little bit about the dynamics.

03:36.920 --> 03:42.680
 So when you have people who are intelligent, who are going to have the same goals, I mean,

03:42.680 --> 03:46.400
 there's space to go away if I'm annoyed at you, I don't think it would be that hard at

03:46.400 --> 03:47.400
 all.

03:47.400 --> 03:48.400
 What's our goals on a desert island?

03:48.400 --> 03:49.400
 Food, shelter.

03:49.400 --> 03:50.400
 Survival.

03:50.400 --> 03:51.400
 Survival.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.400
 Survival, basically.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.400
 Survival and getting out of there, right?

03:53.400 --> 03:54.840
 You don't want to stay on the desert island.

03:54.840 --> 04:01.440
 So yeah, I don't, I don't think, I think that's true of any three, you know, semi rational

04:01.440 --> 04:06.040
 people who, you know, who basically share the goal that they want to survive.

04:06.040 --> 04:07.040
 They want to thrive.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.080
 They want to get off of the island.

04:09.080 --> 04:10.080
 Why would there be conflict?

04:10.080 --> 04:14.560
 I mean, there would be conflict, but, and there can be conflict, but they'd find ways

04:14.560 --> 04:15.560
 to deal with it.

04:15.560 --> 04:20.240
 I don't have this negative view of human beings, particularly not as individuals.

04:20.240 --> 04:26.760
 It's when they get into mobs and groups and collectives that ideology can really motivate

04:26.760 --> 04:28.400
 them to do horrible things.

04:28.400 --> 04:32.960
 One of the things that really drives me crazy is how sinister an impact the book Lord of

04:32.960 --> 04:34.920
 the Flies has had on our culture.

04:34.920 --> 04:36.400
 I read it in high school.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.400
 It's a superb book.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.840
 That's not even a question, but it's not accurate.

04:39.840 --> 04:45.320
 We see in many situations where people are trapped together under difficult circumstances.

04:45.320 --> 04:50.040
 Obviously that book's about children that very quickly it is not about conflict.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.960
 It very quickly becomes about cooperation.

04:52.960 --> 04:53.960
 Let's work together.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.000
 We all have the same goal.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.320
 This is not a time to worry about other things.

04:57.320 --> 05:04.040
 It really, the human beings, the animal instinct that kicks in is the social animal and I'm

05:04.040 --> 05:08.160
 going to shut up and go over there and have a, like stomp my feet instead of arguing with

05:08.160 --> 05:11.760
 your own because we're really trapped in the situation and we need to make it work.

05:11.760 --> 05:14.880
 Well, and to the extent that they're bad people, bad people are dealt with, right?

05:14.880 --> 05:19.360
 So this is true of all of, you know, how did we survive as a species, right?

05:19.360 --> 05:20.640
 How have we survived as a species?

05:20.640 --> 05:24.280
 We've been on a desert island in a sense as a species forever.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.280
 Tribes survived.

05:25.280 --> 05:26.280
 They survived by cooperation.

05:26.280 --> 05:31.200
 They survived by dealing with bad people.

05:31.200 --> 05:37.040
 Civilization is created by people cooperating and working together and allowing individuals

05:37.040 --> 05:43.120
 to thrive within the group and when bad people arise, they deal with them, right?

05:43.120 --> 05:50.700
 Now sometimes these groups get captured by bad people and bad ideas and probably from

05:50.700 --> 05:52.900
 day one that was going on, right?

05:52.900 --> 05:59.380
 The whole tribe is probably a bad idea to begin with, but you know, underneath it all,

05:59.380 --> 06:06.400
 the fact is that to survive as a species, we need to think, we need to be rational and

06:06.400 --> 06:10.720
 if we don't have any respect for reason, then we would all die.

06:10.720 --> 06:11.840
 We would die off.

06:11.840 --> 06:15.000
 So that's a hopeful message, but where does that go wrong?

06:15.000 --> 06:19.440
 So with three people we might get along, we would focus on the basics of life, we have

06:19.440 --> 06:20.600
 similar goals.

06:20.600 --> 06:26.400
 Once women are introduced, their incessant irrationalism and less of their hormones for

06:26.400 --> 06:27.400
 SOL.

06:27.400 --> 06:31.200
 Look, three of us on a desert island would be nice, but without women, it wouldn't be

06:31.200 --> 06:32.200
 fun.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.960
 I'm going to edit out half the things Michael said through this broadcast.

06:34.960 --> 06:37.320
 As you know, I used to run the Ayn Rand Institute.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.880
 She was a woman last time I looked.

06:38.880 --> 06:39.880
 Oh, wait a minute.

06:39.880 --> 06:42.560
 You know, you know exactly what I'm going to say.

06:42.560 --> 06:47.840
 When Ludwig von Mises or Hazlitt, I don't know who it was, Mises was praising Ayn Rand

06:47.840 --> 06:50.320
 and I think it was Hazlitt who said it to her.

06:50.320 --> 06:54.160
 He said, Ludwig von Mises said, you're the smartest man I've ever met.

06:54.160 --> 06:56.520
 And Ayn Rand said, did he say man?

06:56.520 --> 06:57.520
 Right?

06:57.520 --> 06:58.520
 No, she viewed as a compliment.

06:58.520 --> 06:59.520
 Right.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.520
 But she wanted to be clear that he said man.

07:00.520 --> 07:01.520
 She was excited.

07:01.520 --> 07:02.520
 Yes.

07:02.520 --> 07:03.520
 Absolutely.

07:03.520 --> 07:07.760
 I took it as her perceiving him as seeing her as a full equal.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.080
 Oh, I think that's right.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.080
 I think that's right.

07:10.080 --> 07:15.400
 Plus, I think the perception out there, the perception in the culture of man as being

07:15.400 --> 07:22.960
 rational was a compliment to her because that was affirming that he viewed her as a rational.

07:22.960 --> 07:24.440
 Yeah, because Mises is old school.

07:24.440 --> 07:28.360
 He's an older Eastern European guy, so he would definitely have these rigid views.

07:28.360 --> 07:33.240
 Like his wife, I read her autobiography, Margit von Mises, and basically he made her his secretary

07:33.240 --> 07:37.560
 to the point where if he's typing something or he had something handwritten, she had to

07:37.560 --> 07:38.560
 type it out.

07:38.560 --> 07:41.660
 And if she made a typo, he would tear up the page, she had to start from the beginning.

07:41.660 --> 07:44.400
 But it's like, this is the role of the man, this is the role of the woman.

07:44.400 --> 07:47.560
 So for him to regard her, this was kind of a breaking through moment.

07:47.560 --> 07:51.320
 Not that she was secretly misogynist.

07:51.320 --> 07:55.680
 So I think we go wrong when people try to understand the world around them and come

07:55.680 --> 07:57.680
 up with wrong ideas.

07:57.680 --> 08:02.360
 And it's natural that they would come up with wrong ideas because it's hard to figure out

08:02.360 --> 08:03.580
 what's right.

08:03.580 --> 08:10.000
 So we start with trying to come up with mystical explanations for the existence of the things

08:10.000 --> 08:11.780
 around us.

08:11.780 --> 08:16.720
 And that I think very quickly leads to some people being able to communicate with the

08:16.720 --> 08:20.920
 mystical stuff out there and some people not being able to communicate and some people

08:20.920 --> 08:27.380
 wanting to control other people and using those pseudo explanations as a way to control.

08:27.380 --> 08:31.100
 So you always have, Rand called it Attila and the witch doctor.

08:31.100 --> 08:37.320
 You always have a witch doctor, the mystic, the philosopher, the intellectual, the philosopher

08:37.320 --> 08:43.640
 king, and you have an Attila, you have somebody who wants control of the people, who's willing

08:43.640 --> 08:45.960
 to use force to control other people.

08:45.960 --> 08:49.400
 And when those two get together, that's when things go bad.

08:49.400 --> 08:57.560
 And unfortunately, 95, 98% of human history is when those two are together.

08:57.560 --> 09:02.120
 And so the not having them together, having the right ideas, and the right ideas are ones

09:02.120 --> 09:07.720
 that are not exclusive to those guys and where we don't allow Attila to have that kind of

09:07.720 --> 09:13.920
 physical power over us, that's an exception and that's rare and that's what needs to be

09:13.920 --> 09:14.920
 defended.

09:14.920 --> 09:15.920
 Yeah.

09:15.920 --> 09:16.920
 Stalin's not personally killing people.

09:16.920 --> 09:17.920
 Hitler's not personally killing people.

09:17.920 --> 09:18.960
 Charles Manson's not personally killing people.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.320
 They need their goons.

09:20.320 --> 09:25.640
 They need their goons, but also they don't have original ideas.

09:25.640 --> 09:28.280
 Everything Stalin says is original to him, right?

09:28.280 --> 09:31.140
 He needs a Marx, even Lenin, right?

09:31.140 --> 09:33.040
 They all need a Marx, right?

09:33.040 --> 09:40.020
 And Marx needs a particular line of thinkers that come before him that set him up for these

09:40.020 --> 09:41.260
 kind of ideas.

09:41.260 --> 09:45.320
 So Stalin both needs his goons, even though he's somewhat of a goon, particularly Stalin.

09:45.320 --> 09:46.760
 Yeah, he's a bank robber, yeah.

09:46.760 --> 09:51.300
 And then, so take Lenin, Lenin I think is a better example because Lenin's more intellectual

09:51.300 --> 09:52.300
 if you will.

09:52.300 --> 09:56.320
 Lenin needs his goons, he needs his Stalins, but Lenin also needs his Marx.

09:56.320 --> 10:02.000
 And we don't want to let Marx off the hook because Marx knows, I think, implicitly that

10:02.000 --> 10:05.340
 his ideas have to lead to Lenin and Stalin.

10:05.340 --> 10:06.640
 His ideas are not neutral.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.200
 I don't think it's implicit at all.

10:08.200 --> 10:14.080
 I think Marx very much glorified revolution, blood and terror, this is not implicit in

10:14.080 --> 10:15.080
 the slightest.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.080
 No, absolutely.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.800
 I mean, there are letters between him and Engels where they talk about which peoples

10:17.800 --> 10:23.720
 will have to be eliminated because they don't have that proletarian thing, right?

10:23.720 --> 10:31.360
 So I think certain peoples in Southern Europe are not appropriate for the utopia to come

10:31.360 --> 10:32.940
 and will have to be gone.

10:32.940 --> 10:38.600
 And Marx also had this concept which we still see today in garbled ways of polylogism, which

10:38.600 --> 10:44.680
 is if you're a capitalist and I'm bourgeois or I'm a worker, your logic is different than

10:44.680 --> 10:45.680
 mine.

10:45.680 --> 10:47.800
 It's really going to be impossible for us to communicate.

10:47.800 --> 10:49.920
 And at a certain point, you're going to have to be liquidated.

10:49.920 --> 10:52.480
 And they pretend that doesn't mean murdered, but it means murdered.

10:52.480 --> 10:54.600
 And very quickly, everyone becomes a capitalist or bourgeois.

10:54.600 --> 10:57.760
 And then you have the Holodomor and things like this.

10:57.760 --> 10:59.800
 No, he knows exactly where it's going to lead.

10:59.800 --> 11:02.640
 And this is why people say, oh, Marx is not evil.

11:02.640 --> 11:03.640
 He just wrote books.

11:03.640 --> 11:09.180
 No, it's the people who write books who are responsible for the way history evolves.

11:09.180 --> 11:16.040
 And they know the bad guys certainly know the consequence of their ideas, and they need

11:16.040 --> 11:20.600
 to bear the moral responsibility for what happens when the ideas are implemented.

11:20.600 --> 11:21.600
 Here's a way.

11:21.600 --> 11:22.600
 Can I ask a question?

11:22.600 --> 11:23.600
 Yeah.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.600
 Because I think I know more about Rand than Yaron does.

11:24.600 --> 11:25.600
 So let's see.

11:25.600 --> 11:26.600
 Oh.

11:26.600 --> 11:27.600
 Okay.

11:27.600 --> 11:28.600
 The gauntlet has been thrown down.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.880
 Who did Ayn Rand say is the most evil man who ever lived?

11:30.880 --> 11:31.880
 Immanuel Kant.

11:31.880 --> 11:32.880
 That's right.

11:32.880 --> 11:33.880
 Correct.

11:33.880 --> 11:34.880
 No, that I know.

11:34.880 --> 11:36.640
 I mean, it's a big deal that Immanuel Kant is.

11:36.640 --> 11:41.240
 And most people don't understand why, because if you read Kant, there's certain passages

11:41.240 --> 11:47.040
 in Kant that sound pretty liberal, they sound pretty, it sounds like he's for the individual,

11:47.040 --> 11:50.120
 he sounds like he's for the American Revolution, things like that.

11:50.120 --> 11:53.360
 But when you actually read his philosophy and what he's trying to defend and what he's

11:53.360 --> 11:59.160
 trying to undermine, he's trying to undermine the foundations that make the revolution possible,

11:59.160 --> 12:01.600
 that make freedom and individualism possible.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.560
 He's trying to destroy the Enlightenment.

12:03.560 --> 12:08.960
 And the Enlightenment are those ideas that make freedom, individualism feasible.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.720
 He's trying to undermine reason.

12:10.720 --> 12:14.240
 And without reason, we're nothing.

12:14.240 --> 12:16.240
 We can't survive as a species.

12:16.240 --> 12:21.520
 And that's why she thought he was the most evil person, because his ideas undermine the

12:21.520 --> 12:27.000
 very foundations of what it requires to be a human being, reason and individualism.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.240
 Those are the things he's trying to eviscerate.

12:29.240 --> 12:32.480
 I know you've talked about Hoffman before.

12:32.480 --> 12:42.520
 So Hoffman is a modern day attempt to, Donald Hoffman, Donald Hoffman is the University

12:42.520 --> 12:47.520
 of California, Irvine, a neurologist, a neuroscientist, something like that.

12:47.520 --> 12:53.040
 So I met him once and we were at one of these conferences where you do a quick intro, you

12:53.040 --> 12:54.040
 sit and you do a quick intro.

12:54.040 --> 12:58.560
 His introduction was, I've just written a book that proves that evolution has conditioned

12:58.560 --> 13:03.000
 us not to see reality.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
 That is very Kantian.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
 Yeah.

13:05.000 --> 13:13.120
 And he is basically just presenting pseudoscience to defend Kant's position about epistemology

13:13.120 --> 13:14.920
 and about metaphysics.

13:14.920 --> 13:18.200
 And there's nothing original there.

13:18.200 --> 13:23.200
 And he puts up a bunch of equations and he says, I ran a simulation and it proves I'm

13:23.200 --> 13:24.200
 right.

13:24.200 --> 13:28.560
 So Yaron is a little bit frustrated with Donald Hoffman's work.

13:28.560 --> 13:29.560
 Let me...

13:29.560 --> 13:30.560
 I'm not frustrated.

13:30.560 --> 13:35.960
 I just think it's completely wrong and it's anti life, anti mind, anti evolution.

13:35.960 --> 13:38.260
 I think he's an anti evolutionist at the end.

13:38.260 --> 13:42.160
 And I think it, you know, anytime you say, look, here's the important point.

13:42.160 --> 13:47.200
 Anytime you say reality doesn't exist, well, who are you?

13:47.200 --> 13:48.200
 What do you mean by reality?

13:48.200 --> 13:49.280
 What do any of your words mean?

13:49.280 --> 13:52.880
 What does anything you say even mean if it doesn't refer to something that's actually

13:52.880 --> 13:53.880
 out there in reality?

13:53.880 --> 14:00.040
 I try to defend this point of view because in a certain kind of sense, I hear it as being

14:00.040 --> 14:03.520
 humble in the face of the uncertainty that's around us.

14:03.520 --> 14:10.840
 Sort of, you know, when you speak with the confidence of Ayn Rand and yourself, that

14:10.840 --> 14:16.000
 reason can be like this weapon that cuts through all the bullshit of the world and makes us

14:16.000 --> 14:19.680
 like have an ethical moral life and all those kinds of things.

14:19.680 --> 14:24.760
 You kind of assume that reason is a superpower that has no limits.

14:24.760 --> 14:27.760
 Wait, hold on, hold on a second.

14:27.760 --> 14:31.960
 But I got this one.

14:31.960 --> 14:37.520
 See this is already leading to a murder by words and we've been only talking for 20 minutes.

14:37.520 --> 14:40.520
 The three of us wouldn't get together, we wouldn't get along together on an island.

14:40.520 --> 14:42.000
 We'll just make him our slave.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.920
 We're all going to get along.

14:43.920 --> 14:44.920
 He's just going to do the work.

14:44.920 --> 14:49.840
 But I'm afraid I cannot provide any value as a slave, so this is not going to end well

14:49.840 --> 14:50.840
 for me.

14:50.840 --> 14:52.640
 We could provide value as dinner.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.160
 That's the problem I'm trying to get to.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.160
 That's a solution.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.160
 Okay.

14:56.160 --> 15:04.760
 But Donald Hoffman says that there is like he makes an argument that exactly as you said,

15:04.760 --> 15:12.460
 that what we perceive is not, is very, very far from actual physical reality.

15:12.460 --> 15:17.600
 In fact, we're not able to perceive the physical reality at all.

15:17.600 --> 15:26.520
 And he also makes the bigger claim that evolution prefers beings who are not attached to reality.

15:26.520 --> 15:31.160
 So like evolution created creatures that are basically functioning way outside of what

15:31.160 --> 15:32.160
 the physical reality is.

15:32.160 --> 15:33.160
 I got this.

15:33.160 --> 15:34.160
 I got this.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.160
 Okay.

15:35.160 --> 15:37.160
 Because there's a lot to unpack here and I hate all of it.

15:37.160 --> 15:38.160
 Okay.

15:38.160 --> 15:40.120
 First of all, no, no, I'm serious.

15:40.120 --> 15:44.800
 First of all, when you were making that comment about how, you know, reason is a superpower

15:44.800 --> 15:48.800
 beyond limit, you're being ironic, but it's true.

15:48.800 --> 15:51.000
 And I'll give you one example, which is astronomy.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.980
 If you look at the physical size of the universe, it's literally in one sense incomprehensible.

15:55.980 --> 16:00.440
 So he's right in the sense that I do not understand and none of us understand what it means for

16:00.440 --> 16:02.440
 93 million miles away for the sun to be.

16:02.440 --> 16:05.260
 It makes no, it's a number on another screen, right?

16:05.260 --> 16:10.880
 That said, the fact that my mind, and I'm not one of the great thinkers of all time

16:10.880 --> 16:19.080
 is getting there, is capable of appreciating what the sun means, what heliocentrism means.

16:19.080 --> 16:23.720
 The fact that we can, you know, you're a math person that you could look at galaxies and

16:23.720 --> 16:31.120
 reduce it to 10 to the 64th power in terms of distance that shows the unlimited capacity

16:31.120 --> 16:32.720
 of the human mind and reason.

16:32.720 --> 16:33.720
 Number one.

16:33.720 --> 16:41.360
 Number two is if he says that evolution favors those who are not in touch with reality, and

16:41.360 --> 16:44.320
 I don't know in what context he's saying that because that sentence could mean a lot of

16:44.320 --> 16:46.440
 different things.

16:46.440 --> 16:50.900
 Evolution is what guides, reality is what guides evolution.

16:50.900 --> 16:56.680
 Evolution works because you are fitted to the reality of the situation around you.

16:56.680 --> 17:01.440
 It's not that someone is sitting down and says, well, I'm going to add a fin to this

17:01.440 --> 17:04.160
 animal and that fin helps it swim.

17:04.160 --> 17:05.720
 I engineered a check mark.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.360
 It's that mutations occur.

17:08.360 --> 17:11.680
 The vast majority of these mutations are against reality.

17:11.680 --> 17:16.640
 They do not further this animal's life or this plant's life or this fungus's life, but

17:16.640 --> 17:22.300
 the ones that are in touch with reality, such as, okay, it's really cold here.

17:22.300 --> 17:23.920
 There's no predators here.

17:23.920 --> 17:28.280
 If I could figure out, and I'm using that term very loosely, a way where I could survive

17:28.280 --> 17:30.480
 in the cold, I don't have predation.

17:30.480 --> 17:31.760
 It's really great.

17:31.760 --> 17:38.840
 The fact that unconsciously and mindlessly this process can force the mutation and evolution

17:38.840 --> 17:42.000
 of the form precisely means that they're in touch with reality.

17:42.000 --> 17:47.040
 Now, if he means the consciousness is not in touch with reality, that's another thing

17:47.040 --> 17:48.400
 that I really hate.

17:48.400 --> 17:52.440
 You're referring to the reality as like the biological reality of evolution, but all of

17:52.440 --> 17:57.680
 that is based on many other layers of abstraction that ultimately has quantum mechanics underneath

17:57.680 --> 18:01.720
 it all, and he's saying somewhere along the layers, you start to lose more and more and

18:01.720 --> 18:02.720
 more attachment to the actual.

18:02.720 --> 18:03.720
 Hold on.

18:03.720 --> 18:04.720
 Can I add one more sentence?

18:04.720 --> 18:05.720
 Sure, sure.

18:05.720 --> 18:11.960
 I do not, I despise the idea, I say despise, I'm not using this, I'm not joking, the idea

18:11.960 --> 18:17.080
 that the reality we don't live in is somehow more real than this.

18:17.080 --> 18:20.920
 That is a very dangerous idea to say, well, quantum works in this way, and I'm sure he's

18:20.920 --> 18:23.880
 correct and none of us disagree with that.

18:23.880 --> 18:28.200
 What we perceive, macro, works in a different way, well, that's the real reality and this

18:28.200 --> 18:29.200
 is fake.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.200
 Bullshit.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.200
 Yeah.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.200
 This is the real reality.

18:32.200 --> 18:37.280
 That is a different type, a subset, but no one's living there, and humanity is the starting

18:37.280 --> 18:38.280
 point.

18:38.280 --> 18:41.760
 It's a subset that has to integrate with this world.

18:41.760 --> 18:44.840
 There isn't two worlds, one in the quantum world and one here.

18:44.840 --> 18:45.840
 They're integrated.

18:45.840 --> 18:49.040
 Now, we might not have the scientific knowledge to know how they're integrated, but so what?

18:49.040 --> 18:52.360
 We know that there's only one reality and that's this one.

18:52.360 --> 18:53.440
 He has this difference.

18:53.440 --> 18:59.960
 He says, evolution matches up to fitness, not to reality, and he creates this dichotomy

18:59.960 --> 19:03.320
 between fitness and reality, but that's complete nonsense.

19:03.320 --> 19:08.980
 There is no such thing as a concept of fitness outside of fitness to what?

19:08.980 --> 19:10.640
 To reality.

19:10.640 --> 19:12.400
 Fitness and reality are the same thing.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.180
 They're not separate things.

19:14.180 --> 19:21.300
 The whole way he sets this up intellectually is wrong, I think to some extent dishonest,

19:21.300 --> 19:23.140
 and certainly philosophically corrupt.

19:23.140 --> 19:24.140
 It's Kantian.

19:24.140 --> 19:29.520
 Again, he's accepted Kant's ideas, and everybody pretty much has accepted Kant's ideas for

19:29.520 --> 19:32.960
 the last 200 years, and they give it a different facade.

19:32.960 --> 19:37.000
 He's giving it an evolutionary facade, but it's just a facade for the same idea, and

19:37.000 --> 19:43.080
 that is that somehow because we have eyes, we cannot see, because the light waves are

19:43.080 --> 19:46.440
 going through a medium, and that medium necessarily distorted.

19:46.440 --> 19:49.720
 The medium changes the resolution at which you see.

19:49.720 --> 19:52.640
 If I take off my glasses, I'm seeing it a little differently.

19:52.640 --> 19:56.480
 The thing is still there, and the thing is still there in the way I see it, because I'm

19:56.480 --> 19:58.840
 grasping the handle and lifting the cup.

19:58.840 --> 19:59.840
 That's not an illusion.

19:59.840 --> 20:00.840
 That is a real cup.

20:00.840 --> 20:03.320
 So do you think some things are more real than others?

20:03.320 --> 20:04.320
 For example, money.

20:04.320 --> 20:08.360
 There's a bunch of things that seem real.

20:08.360 --> 20:09.640
 This is not an Animal Farm reference.

20:09.640 --> 20:11.800
 Is this going to be about love?

20:11.800 --> 20:16.200
 There's nothing as real as love, right Lex?

20:16.200 --> 20:19.360
 Love is a fundamental part of the quantum mechanics, yes.

20:19.360 --> 20:20.360
 No.

20:20.360 --> 20:21.360
 No.

20:21.360 --> 20:22.360
 No.

20:22.360 --> 20:27.400
 There are some things that have become reality because we humans, in a collective sense,

20:27.400 --> 20:28.520
 believe it.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.320
 You can't believe something collectively.

20:30.320 --> 20:31.960
 Now it doesn't become real.

20:31.960 --> 20:33.800
 What does it mean to say something's real?

20:33.800 --> 20:36.880
 That is, you can, so love, for example, love's a good example, right?

20:36.880 --> 20:38.640
 Love is an abstraction, right?

20:38.640 --> 20:40.280
 It's not something I can touch.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.960
 It's not something I can see, but it's certainly something you would feel.

20:42.960 --> 20:45.880
 Not something you can hit.

20:45.880 --> 20:46.880
 We love differently.

20:46.880 --> 20:47.880
 You and I.

20:47.880 --> 20:48.880
 I don't think that's true.

20:48.880 --> 20:49.880
 I think I'm just too honest about it.

20:49.880 --> 20:50.880
 You can't hit love.

20:50.880 --> 20:53.160
 You can't, love is an abstraction.

20:53.160 --> 20:54.160
 So is love real?

20:54.160 --> 20:56.460
 Yes, it's real because I feel it.

20:56.460 --> 21:00.440
 It's an existent, but it's not an existent in the same sense as this cup is.

21:00.440 --> 21:07.920
 So abstractions are real, but at the end of the day, all abstractions have to be able

21:07.920 --> 21:14.640
 to be reduced to actual concrete so you can either see it.

21:14.640 --> 21:19.240
 I really don't like criticizing someone whose work I haven't read secondhand.

21:19.240 --> 21:22.440
 So I want to take this away from speaking about him personally, because I'm not familiar

21:22.440 --> 21:23.440
 with his work.

21:23.440 --> 21:24.440
 He is a nice guy.

21:24.440 --> 21:25.440
 That makes me like him.

21:25.440 --> 21:26.440
 That makes him like him less.

21:26.440 --> 21:31.120
 Now you're back talking about evolutionary fitness again.

21:31.120 --> 21:39.480
 I think there's disingenuousness when we talk about the word real in terms of ideas are

21:39.480 --> 21:45.480
 real versus the cup is real, and you try to switch back between those two meanings, and

21:45.480 --> 21:51.240
 it's a little bit of linguistic wordplay that is trying to force a point that's not accurate,

21:51.240 --> 21:52.240
 in my opinion.

21:52.240 --> 21:57.520
 Well, I think the issue is, and what he's challenging is, and what Kant is challenging

21:57.520 --> 22:01.280
 is, do we know reality?

22:01.280 --> 22:03.320
 And I think the answer is yes, we do.

22:03.320 --> 22:04.320
 We know reality.

22:04.320 --> 22:05.320
 We observe it.

22:05.320 --> 22:07.680
 Now, do we know everything about reality?

22:07.680 --> 22:08.680
 No.

22:08.680 --> 22:12.720
 We can't, for example, sense what a bat senses as reality.

22:12.720 --> 22:16.000
 A bat observes reality through, what is it?

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
 Sonar.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
 Sound waves, right?

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
 Yeah.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
 Through sonar.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
 Right?

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
 So it has a different sense, but it's the same reality.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
 It's still a table.

22:23.000 --> 22:28.160
 The bat's spatial relationship to the table is different than ours, but the object is

22:28.160 --> 22:29.160
 still the same object.

22:29.160 --> 22:31.240
 But how do you know that's true?

22:31.240 --> 22:34.320
 Are you not just hoping that's true or assuming that's true?

22:34.320 --> 22:35.960
 That's what no means.

22:35.960 --> 22:39.720
 No means I have identified an aspect of reality.

22:39.720 --> 22:41.880
 That's literally the definition of knowledge.

22:41.880 --> 22:43.600
 Now if you say, how are you certain?

22:43.600 --> 22:47.880
 Well, that's a whole other question, but one of the reasons I know it was certain is because

22:47.880 --> 22:48.880
 this happens.

22:48.880 --> 22:49.880
 Yes.

22:49.880 --> 22:50.880
 Okay.

22:50.880 --> 22:51.880
 And I know this is going to happen.

22:51.880 --> 22:55.500
 And if I tell you, if you go downstairs, you're going to see, you know, Mr. Jones and you

22:55.500 --> 22:59.840
 walk downstairs and I see Mr. Jones, at the very least, you know, something's going on

22:59.840 --> 23:00.840
 there.

23:00.840 --> 23:02.720
 So what about all the things that mess with our perception?

23:02.720 --> 23:05.320
 For example, we've talked about psychedelics before.

23:05.320 --> 23:10.640
 Talked about in dreams where you'd be detached from this, I mean, there's certain things

23:10.640 --> 23:12.920
 that happen to your brain to where you're not able to perceive.

23:12.920 --> 23:14.320
 So you're not perceiving reality.

23:14.320 --> 23:15.320
 That's right.

23:15.320 --> 23:16.720
 So your brain is creating a different reality.

23:16.720 --> 23:17.720
 It's not real.

23:17.720 --> 23:19.200
 How do you know it's not real?

23:19.200 --> 23:21.880
 How do you know the elves will meet in the...

23:21.880 --> 23:26.920
 Because partially because I need to take a drug in order to do it, because I'm asleep

23:26.920 --> 23:28.560
 when I'm dreaming.

23:28.560 --> 23:29.560
 It's not reality.

23:29.560 --> 23:33.560
 That is clearly a creation of our mind.

23:33.560 --> 23:34.560
 It's not a creed.

23:34.560 --> 23:35.560
 Hold on.

23:35.560 --> 23:36.560
 Let's get to the psychedelics.

23:36.560 --> 23:37.560
 The drug is real.

23:37.560 --> 23:42.240
 I think you're going to be thinking I'm joking a lot more than I am this episode.

23:42.240 --> 23:43.960
 I'm going to be the humorist objectivist.

23:43.960 --> 23:47.820
 He could be the court jester.

23:47.820 --> 23:51.880
 In terms of psychedelic, when people are perceiving these elves, these machine elves, these other

23:51.880 --> 23:57.200
 entities, whether they could either be real or not, I don't know.

23:57.200 --> 24:02.880
 But the point is that doesn't go to his broader point because if these beings exist and the

24:02.880 --> 24:06.720
 only way to perceive them is to take a drug, they still exist.

24:06.720 --> 24:07.720
 This is just...

24:07.720 --> 24:14.640
 For example, if I'm walking outside in the woods at night and there's a deer and I can't

24:14.640 --> 24:17.740
 see it, but if I put on night vision goggles, I can see it.

24:17.740 --> 24:19.600
 That deer was there the entire time.

24:19.600 --> 24:22.780
 It's not that the night vision goggles caused the deer to appear.

24:22.780 --> 24:28.160
 You can recreate it not only using night vision goggles, but you can then use sonar.

24:28.160 --> 24:31.840
 You can use other mechanisms by which to prove that the deer is there.

24:31.840 --> 24:36.600
 The thing with psychedelics is that...I don't know because maybe I'm the least experienced

24:36.600 --> 24:38.640
 with psychedelics here probably.

24:38.640 --> 24:41.480
 My guess is every time you take the psychedelic, you have exactly the same experience of the

24:41.480 --> 24:42.480
 deer.

24:42.480 --> 24:43.480
 No.

24:43.480 --> 24:48.000
 Second, are there other mechanisms, other scientific mechanisms by which I can find

24:48.000 --> 24:50.880
 the deer out there other than the psychedelics?

24:50.880 --> 24:51.880
 We don't know yet.

24:51.880 --> 24:52.880
 So...

24:52.880 --> 24:53.880
 Well, we don't know yet.

24:53.880 --> 24:54.880
 Well, but the...

24:54.880 --> 24:56.520
 This is Occam's Razor, right?

24:56.520 --> 25:02.340
 The simplest explanation here is the most likely, and that is that you've taken something

25:02.340 --> 25:07.080
 that's messing with the chemicals in the brain, something is being...that your brain can project.

25:07.080 --> 25:08.080
 We dream.

25:08.080 --> 25:12.600
 Nobody's arguing that the dream is real and reality is not, or if they are, I think they're

25:12.600 --> 25:13.600
 nuts.

25:13.600 --> 25:15.360
 The dream is a dream.

25:15.360 --> 25:20.680
 Your brain is creating an image of telling you a story.

25:20.680 --> 25:22.160
 Psychedelics are simulating the same thing.

25:22.160 --> 25:25.240
 That's probably what's going on until there's evidence to the contrary.

25:25.240 --> 25:26.240
 Well, hold on.

25:26.240 --> 25:29.360
 Let me disagree with you a little bit, because let's take Adderall, for example.

25:29.360 --> 25:30.360
 No one here disagrees.

25:30.360 --> 25:34.520
 That's something much more simpler and less out of this world.

25:34.520 --> 25:37.720
 I think what he might be speaking to, I know Joe Rogan talks about this and other people

25:37.720 --> 25:41.080
 in this space, is that when you take certain drugs, it changes your perception.

25:41.080 --> 25:44.040
 It doesn't have to be otherworldly, it changes your perception of what's around you.

25:44.040 --> 25:47.400
 And as an example, what they talk about is, the three of us are talking, there's lots

25:47.400 --> 25:50.960
 of other stuff in the room, we're only aware of it vaguely on a personal level.

25:50.960 --> 25:51.960
 So it changes the...

25:51.960 --> 25:52.960
 Hold on, let me finish.

25:52.960 --> 25:53.960
 No, I don't do that.

25:53.960 --> 25:54.960
 I'm Israeli.

25:54.960 --> 25:55.960
 You're about to start.

25:55.960 --> 25:58.680
 This is back to the desert island of murder.

25:58.680 --> 26:00.800
 No, but we just resolved it within three seconds.

26:00.800 --> 26:01.800
 We did.

26:01.800 --> 26:02.800
 There's no conch.

26:02.800 --> 26:05.800
 He's trying to get us to feed on the truth.

26:05.800 --> 26:06.800
 Yeah, it's not going to happen.

26:06.800 --> 26:07.800
 Exactly.

26:07.800 --> 26:08.800
 I'm trying to create murder.

26:08.800 --> 26:09.800
 No one has asthma.

26:09.800 --> 26:10.800
 It's going to be fine.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.760
 Because if the two of you murder each other, there's more food for me.

26:12.760 --> 26:13.760
 There's no food.

26:13.760 --> 26:14.760
 You're all...

26:14.760 --> 26:15.760
 Well, ratings would go up.

26:15.760 --> 26:16.760
 You robots eat alcohol.

26:16.760 --> 26:17.760
 Ratings would go up.

26:17.760 --> 26:18.760
 Viewership would go up.

26:18.760 --> 26:19.760
 Yeah, it's good for the ratings.

26:19.760 --> 26:20.760
 Yeah.

26:20.760 --> 26:22.480
 But if you take, for example, Adderall or speed, right?

26:22.480 --> 26:25.680
 People like you focus on things, you perceive things that aren't there.

26:25.680 --> 26:27.800
 But that doesn't mean those things weren't there to begin with.

26:27.800 --> 26:32.320
 There are absolutely ways to change human perception chemically, through glasses, through

26:32.320 --> 26:33.760
 getting drunk.

26:33.760 --> 26:37.200
 None of that changes the fact that the reality underneath it is real and is causing this

26:37.200 --> 26:38.200
 effect.

26:38.200 --> 26:39.200
 Absolutely.

26:39.200 --> 26:40.200
 And it has a particular nature, right?

26:40.200 --> 26:43.160
 And all it's doing is changing the focus, right?

26:43.160 --> 26:45.400
 So if I take off my glasses, I'm seeing the same thing.

26:45.400 --> 26:49.240
 I'm just seeing something's out of focus and maybe in the distance, I can't see something.

26:49.240 --> 26:50.240
 It's just gone.

26:50.240 --> 26:51.240
 And then I put it on.

26:51.240 --> 26:52.240
 There it is.

26:52.240 --> 26:53.380
 That thing was always there.

26:53.380 --> 26:57.640
 It's just the sensitivity I have to it has changed.

26:57.640 --> 27:00.720
 And it's absolutely not sensitive to everything equally.

27:00.720 --> 27:03.800
 And drugs can change the relative sensitivities.

27:03.800 --> 27:06.000
 It doesn't change reality.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.600
 It changes our ability to focus on reality.

27:09.600 --> 27:13.400
 Let me give you one great example, the microscope.

27:13.400 --> 27:14.400
 I forget who it was.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.840
 His name was with an L, the scientist who discovered it.

27:16.840 --> 27:21.380
 He had a drop of water and he's seeing monsters, the protozoa in this drop of water.

27:21.380 --> 27:24.880
 For him, it must have been, it is like a drug experience, like, wait a minute, I'm drinking

27:24.880 --> 27:25.880
 this.

27:25.880 --> 27:29.280
 And there's alien beings whose shapes are completely crazy in this water.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.500
 Those beings were always there.

27:30.500 --> 27:32.000
 Those beings were there before any of us were here.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.800
 They've been there for billions of years.

27:33.800 --> 27:37.780
 But because he had this apparatus, now he's able to see protozoa.

27:37.780 --> 27:41.920
 No one's arguing protozoa are extradimensional, no one's arguing the supernatural, amoebas

27:41.920 --> 27:44.360
 are well studied, paramecia, all the other lots.

27:44.360 --> 27:49.000
 So if these elves, the machine elves are real, and the only way to perceive them is through

27:49.000 --> 27:53.800
 DMT or something like that, that doesn't contradict the broader point that they've always been

27:53.800 --> 27:56.360
 there and this is the mechanism for perceiving them.

27:56.360 --> 27:59.920
 So here's the word I was looking for, it's the word actually Greg taught me this, so

27:59.920 --> 28:02.000
 Greg Salamieri.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.940
 So it's resolution, right?

28:03.940 --> 28:04.940
 So it's resolution.

28:04.940 --> 28:06.680
 My resolution changes with the glasses.

28:06.680 --> 28:09.600
 My resolution gets finer with the microscope.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.920
 So there's probably some bacteria here on the table.

28:11.920 --> 28:12.920
 100%.

28:12.920 --> 28:13.920
 Right?

28:13.920 --> 28:14.920
 There's no doubt about it.

28:14.920 --> 28:15.920
 I can't see them.

28:15.920 --> 28:19.880
 I can't use the microscope to not see them, but they're either there or they're not there.

28:19.880 --> 28:24.120
 And I have the tools to discover whether they are there or they're not there.

28:24.120 --> 28:26.000
 And that's called a microscope.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.840
 Now there could be even smaller beings that even with a microscope, I won't be able to

28:29.840 --> 28:34.240
 define, but that's completely arbitrary to claim that, that they're there until I find

28:34.240 --> 28:36.040
 a tool to be able to discover it.

28:36.040 --> 28:41.360
 The same with what you see if you're seeing other beings when you're taking psychedelics.

28:41.360 --> 28:46.280
 Unless you find another tool to be able to see them with, the simplest assumption is

28:46.280 --> 28:47.840
 probably the truest assumption.

28:47.840 --> 28:50.440
 But even the not simplest assumption doesn't contradict the broader point.

28:50.440 --> 28:51.440
 No.

28:51.440 --> 28:52.440
 Which is again, reality is what it is.

28:52.440 --> 28:56.160
 If it turns out that there are these creatures that you can only see with psychedelics, and

28:56.160 --> 29:00.720
 there are these creatures that you can only see with psychedelics, and our resolution

29:00.720 --> 29:04.500
 while we're not on psychedelics is not fine enough to observe them.

29:04.500 --> 29:05.500
 So what?

29:05.500 --> 29:10.960
 That doesn't change the fact that we evolved to survive in reality as it is.

29:10.960 --> 29:14.720
 What do you do with the possibility that our resolution as it currently stands is really,

29:14.720 --> 29:15.960
 really crappy?

29:15.960 --> 29:16.960
 That basically.

29:16.960 --> 29:17.960
 Well, it's not.

29:17.960 --> 29:19.520
 No, but you don't know that.

29:19.520 --> 29:20.520
 No, we know it.

29:20.520 --> 29:21.520
 We know it completely.

29:21.520 --> 29:22.520
 Compared to who?

29:22.520 --> 29:23.520
 Exactly.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.520
 Compared to the future possibilities like artificial intelligence.

29:24.520 --> 29:25.520
 It is true.

29:25.520 --> 29:26.520
 Hundreds of years.

29:26.520 --> 29:27.520
 It is crappy compared to the future.

29:27.520 --> 29:28.520
 That's true.

29:28.520 --> 29:29.520
 Fine.

29:29.520 --> 29:30.520
 But that's not relevant.

29:30.520 --> 29:31.520
 Much, much.

29:31.520 --> 29:32.520
 Yes.

29:32.520 --> 29:33.520
 Or just the magnitude of crappy.

29:33.520 --> 29:34.520
 Of course.

29:34.520 --> 29:35.520
 No, but here I'll use the standard that Hoffman uses, evolution, right?

29:35.520 --> 29:39.880
 The reason I know that our resolution is phenomenal, it's phenomenally good, right?

29:39.880 --> 29:46.540
 Because look at us, we're sitting here comfortably in an apartment with air conditioning and

29:46.540 --> 29:53.080
 in warm Austin with microphones and we did all this stuff, we're really good at survival

29:53.080 --> 29:54.480
 and changing the environment.

29:54.480 --> 29:59.600
 Indeed, if you look at the species that we know of, there's not a species that come anywhere

29:59.600 --> 30:05.200
 close to our ability to deal with reality, to observe reality, to understand reality

30:05.200 --> 30:06.200
 and to shape it.

30:06.200 --> 30:09.760
 Now in the future, well, we'll come up with machines that can figure out stuff that we

30:09.760 --> 30:12.680
 have no clue about today.

30:12.680 --> 30:16.080
 That's only because we're so well suited to reality that can we create those machines.

30:16.080 --> 30:20.480
 And I promise you, in the future, it's going to be much more what you're saying.

30:20.480 --> 30:21.480
 That's how it's going to happen.

30:21.480 --> 30:24.640
 No, but the thing is, when the creatures from the future look back to the things we're saying

30:24.640 --> 30:28.080
 now, what Aydin Rand is saying, what you're saying with certainty, do you think they'll

30:28.080 --> 30:32.480
 laugh at the level of how much confusion there was, how much inaccuracy?

30:32.480 --> 30:33.480
 Did you?

30:33.480 --> 30:34.480
 No.

30:34.480 --> 30:35.480
 No, no.

30:35.480 --> 30:36.480
 Let me get this one.

30:36.480 --> 30:37.480
 You know what they're going to do?

30:37.480 --> 30:38.480
 Yes.

30:38.480 --> 30:42.280
 They're going to either read Aristotle or read any of these great geniuses of the past.

30:42.280 --> 30:44.760
 It's like these people didn't have electricity.

30:44.760 --> 30:49.680
 They didn't have warm clothes or anything, and they're able to figure out the diameter

30:49.680 --> 30:50.680
 of the Earth.

30:50.680 --> 30:55.060
 Like the creativity to be and to get it within a few miles.

30:55.060 --> 30:59.420
 The creativity and to figure out the speed of light when you don't even have a stopwatch.

30:59.420 --> 31:04.900
 When you look back, a lot of it's nonsense, but it's like when you're talking to a kid.

31:04.900 --> 31:09.280
 They would disregard the nonsense, and when they get something right, it's awe.

31:09.280 --> 31:11.320
 So it's never a numbers game, right?

31:11.320 --> 31:16.600
 So it's the few that validate and justify the rest.

31:16.600 --> 31:20.780
 So when you look at Aristotle, he's talking about there was one of those causes which

31:20.780 --> 31:23.120
 is like time travel and it doesn't really make sense.

31:23.120 --> 31:26.680
 But you look at the rest of this stuff or even Plato or any of these greats, it's like,

31:26.680 --> 31:29.160
 oh my, this is an amazing miracle.

31:29.160 --> 31:31.340
 I wouldn't say literally miracle, I got you, everyone.

31:31.340 --> 31:34.300
 But at the same time, yeah, a lot of these other people had stupid ideas.

31:34.300 --> 31:35.300
 You don't care.

31:35.300 --> 31:39.860
 You care about those great, great minds and how they moved us all forward.

31:39.860 --> 31:42.720
 To this day, we still study Pythagoras.

31:42.720 --> 31:46.320
 And it's not even just the sciences and the math.

31:46.320 --> 31:48.560
 Think about the philosophy.

31:48.560 --> 31:52.520
 How much is there to learn from reading Aristotle or Plato or Socrates when you disagree with

31:52.520 --> 31:53.520
 them?

31:53.520 --> 31:58.220
 How many giants have there been in all of human history that have had the minds of Socrates

31:58.220 --> 32:00.640
 or Plato and Aristotle?

32:00.640 --> 32:04.760
 A thousand years where they look back at Plato and Aristotle and admire them?

32:04.760 --> 32:05.760
 Absolutely.

32:05.760 --> 32:10.960
 Well, they find certain things that are wrong, yes, but certain things that Aristotle discovered

32:10.960 --> 32:14.240
 are absolutely right and will always be right.

32:14.240 --> 32:16.680
 Certain things that Ayn Rand discovered will always be right.

32:16.680 --> 32:21.440
 I think a lot of what she came up with, will some things be discovered to be wrong?

32:21.440 --> 32:22.440
 Yeah.

32:22.440 --> 32:25.200
 You know, that wouldn't shock me.

32:25.200 --> 32:33.100
 But the genius and the truth that we know today is amazing.

32:33.100 --> 32:38.600
 It's stunning to be pessimistic about us because in the future we'll know more.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.160
 Not pessimistic, but more humble.

32:40.160 --> 32:42.000
 There's no reason to be humble.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.760
 I mean, I really think humility is a vice, not a virtue.

32:45.760 --> 32:46.760
 What's there to be humble about?

32:46.760 --> 32:48.520
 Look at life.

32:48.520 --> 32:49.520
 This is amazing.

32:49.520 --> 32:51.120
 We should be...

32:51.120 --> 32:52.120
 But the word humble has different meanings.

32:52.120 --> 32:53.120
 I know.

32:53.120 --> 32:54.120
 I know.

32:54.120 --> 32:55.120
 Okay.

32:55.120 --> 32:56.120
 I know what it's going to get.

32:56.120 --> 33:07.880
 I mean, humility in a sense of not appreciating the genius and the ability and the success

33:07.880 --> 33:15.240
 and all the stuff that we as individuals, I think, in our lives, but as a culture, as

33:15.240 --> 33:18.760
 a movement, if you think about movement in terms of those of us who respect reason have

33:18.760 --> 33:24.500
 achieved in spite of the odds, we should be proud of that and pride as the virtue.

33:24.500 --> 33:27.560
 Humility in the sense of, yeah, I know there's more to know.

33:27.560 --> 33:30.520
 I know there's a lot more to know and in the future we'll know more.

33:30.520 --> 33:31.520
 Sure.

33:31.520 --> 33:32.520
 But I don't think that's the way...

33:32.520 --> 33:35.820
 See, I take humility as the way the Christians use it, which is the other way.

33:35.820 --> 33:37.480
 And I think it's a real vice.

33:37.480 --> 33:41.880
 It's don't think of yourself too much just because you can think that's no big deal or

33:41.880 --> 33:43.280
 just because you can create this stuff.

33:43.280 --> 33:44.920
 It is a big deal.

33:44.920 --> 33:47.960
 Your achievements are a big deal and you should take credit for them.

33:47.960 --> 33:52.280
 So be careful with the word humility because the real meaning is the Christian meaning,

33:52.280 --> 33:54.800
 which is a very, very bad meaning.

33:54.800 --> 33:55.800
 Hold on.

33:55.800 --> 33:58.160
 Let me be a little pedantic because there's no such thing as real meaning, right?

33:58.160 --> 33:59.160
 So there's different meanings.

33:59.160 --> 34:00.160
 Okay.

34:00.160 --> 34:01.160
 Hold on.

34:01.160 --> 34:03.480
 This is semantics, but here's another real meaning that you're not going to disagree

34:03.480 --> 34:09.440
 with, which is the smartest person on earth is ignorant of 99.9% of knowledge, right?

34:09.440 --> 34:14.880
 So if I meet someone who is less intelligent than me and less informed than me, it is still

34:14.880 --> 34:18.480
 certain that this person has things to teach me.

34:18.480 --> 34:22.720
 If I go to a mechanic and maybe this guy's dumb as rocks.

34:22.720 --> 34:24.440
 I don't know anything about cars.

34:24.440 --> 34:26.040
 What he tells me about that car is good.

34:26.040 --> 34:27.320
 I could take it to the bank.

34:27.320 --> 34:29.520
 He's going to be in a position to inform me.

34:29.520 --> 34:34.600
 So one of the reasons humility is extremely important is very often you have people and

34:34.600 --> 34:39.360
 you see this very much in academia who think you know exactly where I'm going around who

34:39.360 --> 34:43.180
 think they're know what else and they think, oh, I have this degree.

34:43.180 --> 34:44.180
 You're a layman.

34:44.180 --> 34:46.000
 You've never been formally educated.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.680
 Therefore not only you dumb and uneducated and you're wrong.

34:49.680 --> 34:53.480
 And it's like this person might be have won a great example of this.

34:53.480 --> 34:58.640
 And this is an example you might not like is a lot of times you have these native populations

34:58.640 --> 35:02.680
 and they'll have a better understanding of the animals around them, the plants, the fruits,

35:02.680 --> 35:03.680
 whatever.

35:03.680 --> 35:06.200
 And you'd have these scientists and be like, oh, they're talking about this monster in

35:06.200 --> 35:07.200
 the woods.

35:07.200 --> 35:08.200
 Yeah, whatever.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.200
 This giant, this giant ape.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.200
 But it was real.

35:10.200 --> 35:11.200
 It was the gorilla.

35:11.200 --> 35:14.080
 But you know, you dismiss them because, oh, these are stupid, ignorant, whatever people

35:14.080 --> 35:15.540
 that's kind of changed to some extent.

35:15.540 --> 35:20.940
 But that is an aspect of humility that I think behooves especially highly intelligent people

35:20.940 --> 35:25.200
 because there is such a presumption to be dismissive of people who you regard as less

35:25.200 --> 35:26.200
 than.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.200
 But they're often right.

35:27.200 --> 35:28.200
 So I agree.

35:28.200 --> 35:31.480
 I agree with all of the concrete examples.

35:31.480 --> 35:34.020
 I just think we should come up with a better word than humility.

35:34.020 --> 35:36.200
 And I don't have one because I'm not I'm not a woodsmith.

35:36.200 --> 35:37.200
 I'm not.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.820
 This is not my strength.

35:38.820 --> 35:43.780
 But humility, humility is a is a word from the Christian ethics.

35:43.780 --> 35:47.720
 And it means something very specific in the field of ethics.

35:47.720 --> 35:54.200
 And it means the opposite of of what I think virtue requires.

35:54.200 --> 35:55.200
 It's demeaning.

35:55.200 --> 35:56.520
 It's to put you down.

35:56.520 --> 36:00.240
 It's to it's to it's to resist pride.

36:00.240 --> 36:01.800
 And I think pride is a very important thing.

36:01.800 --> 36:02.800
 I don't know.

36:02.800 --> 36:03.800
 You're on.

36:03.800 --> 36:04.800
 But again, you have to define your terms properly.

36:04.800 --> 36:09.560
 Hating myself has has been quite useful for me as well, but that's because you're Russian

36:09.560 --> 36:10.560
 and Jewish.

36:10.560 --> 36:17.000
 So by what this changes, you know, this is this is what happens, right?

36:17.000 --> 36:22.800
 We're brought up to, you know, to to feel exactly that way in a good Russian boy.

36:22.800 --> 36:23.800
 So we got him.

36:23.800 --> 36:24.800
 Oh, my God.

36:24.800 --> 36:25.800
 What is this?

36:25.800 --> 36:26.800
 What is this?

36:26.800 --> 36:27.800
 Gimmat again.

36:27.800 --> 36:28.800
 What is this?

36:28.800 --> 36:29.800
 Gimmat again.

36:29.800 --> 36:30.800
 What is that?

36:30.800 --> 36:31.800
 What it says?

36:31.800 --> 36:32.800
 Yeah.

36:32.800 --> 36:33.800
 Gimmat again.

36:33.800 --> 36:34.800
 I can't.

36:34.800 --> 36:35.800
 I can't.

36:35.800 --> 36:36.800
 I'm blind.

36:36.800 --> 36:37.800
 Yeah.

36:37.800 --> 36:38.800
 But as long as you're good.

36:38.800 --> 36:39.800
 But is it kosher?

36:39.800 --> 36:40.800
 Yes, it is.

36:40.800 --> 36:43.460
 Check if it's kosher.

36:43.460 --> 36:44.720
 This is Ukrainian, my friend.

36:44.720 --> 36:46.440
 Oh, oh, my God.

36:46.440 --> 36:47.440
 That is a sin.

36:47.440 --> 36:48.440
 How dare you?

36:48.440 --> 36:49.440
 That is really simple.

36:49.440 --> 36:50.920
 You know, me and Sinai were born in the same town.

36:50.920 --> 36:51.920
 I'm kidding.

36:51.920 --> 36:52.920
 My dad is Ukrainian.

36:52.920 --> 36:53.920
 Don't get mad.

36:53.920 --> 36:58.960
 So I don't think I don't think self self.

36:58.960 --> 37:00.960
 What did you how did you define it?

37:00.960 --> 37:01.960
 Self hate?

37:01.960 --> 37:02.960
 Yeah.

37:02.960 --> 37:05.960
 I think self hate is quite destructive.

37:05.960 --> 37:06.960
 Speak for yourself.

37:06.960 --> 37:10.400
 I think that humility is quite destructive.

37:10.400 --> 37:12.960
 Humility in the sense of I'm no big deal.

37:12.960 --> 37:13.960
 No.

37:13.960 --> 37:15.860
 I mean, if you've achieved something in life, you are a big deal.

37:15.860 --> 37:20.560
 You are a big deal because, you know, look, you got the two of us to fly into town just

37:20.560 --> 37:22.400
 to sit down here and have a conversation with you.

37:22.400 --> 37:23.400
 You're a big deal.

37:23.400 --> 37:24.840
 That says more about you than me.

37:24.840 --> 37:25.840
 We're just desperate.

37:25.840 --> 37:26.840
 We're lonely and depraved.

37:26.840 --> 37:27.840
 I'm not lonely.

37:27.840 --> 37:33.720
 I might be desperate.

37:33.720 --> 37:40.480
 I'm starting to question your ability to reason with the decisions you're making on the on

37:40.480 --> 37:44.520
 the aspect of and I should mention that The Idiot by Dostoevsky is one of my favorite

37:44.520 --> 37:47.800
 novels and there is a Christian ethic that runs through that.

37:47.800 --> 37:52.860
 I mean, because because, yeah, I mean, particularly but I hate to bring this up, but particularly

37:52.860 --> 37:57.880
 Russians and particularly Russian Jews and particularly Eastern European Jews are incredibly

37:57.880 --> 37:58.880
 Christian.

37:58.880 --> 38:06.480
 There's a there's a there's a real Christian theme in in Judaism that's that's about guilt.

38:06.480 --> 38:09.600
 Guilt is not there's no guilt in Judaism.

38:09.600 --> 38:11.200
 King David doesn't feel any guilt.

38:11.200 --> 38:12.200
 Solomon doesn't.

38:12.200 --> 38:13.960
 There's no guilt in the in the Old Testament.

38:13.960 --> 38:15.300
 Plenty of guilt.

38:15.300 --> 38:18.760
 Once Christianity has an impact on Judaism, we're raised to feel this way.

38:18.760 --> 38:20.160
 We're raised to be humble.

38:20.160 --> 38:22.000
 We're raised not to feel special.

38:22.000 --> 38:27.720
 We were raised to think we're no big deal and to and our mothers put us down and and

38:27.720 --> 38:31.040
 use that against us and try to inflict guilt on us.

38:31.040 --> 38:33.480
 They raise us up and then they knock us down.

38:33.480 --> 38:36.640
 It's a mechanism, but it's it's a cultural mechanism.

38:36.640 --> 38:39.240
 And I think it's very destructive to self esteem and to happiness.

38:39.240 --> 38:42.120
 Let me and I'll give you a great he's absolutely right with what he just said.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.120
 I disagree.

38:43.120 --> 38:44.120
 Oh, yeah.

38:44.120 --> 38:45.120
 Why?

38:45.120 --> 38:46.120
 Why is he right?

38:46.120 --> 38:48.700
 Because like my family, for example, it still doesn't really understand how I could pay

38:48.700 --> 38:50.460
 the rent because I don't go into an office.

38:50.460 --> 38:55.120
 And like when I started out trying to be a writer, the immediate reaction isn't which

38:55.120 --> 38:58.840
 is a lot of times I talk to kids, right, and they have these aspirations.

38:58.840 --> 39:02.040
 And I'll tell them, go for it while you're young.

39:02.040 --> 39:05.880
 If you fail, you'll go to your grave with like I tried my best.

39:05.880 --> 39:07.280
 I didn't make it happen.

39:07.280 --> 39:11.000
 Whereas if you don't try and never achieve, you are going to feel horrible for the rest

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
 of your life.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.400
 And this is the example I use all the time.

39:13.400 --> 39:19.320
 I bring up many times I go go to any bookstore and look at all those terrible, terrible books

39:19.320 --> 39:22.280
 on the shelves that you wonder, how is this a book that could be you?

39:22.280 --> 39:23.820
 You could be that crappy writer.

39:23.820 --> 39:27.600
 But the thing is, in that culture that Yaron was talking about, you tell your family, I'm

39:27.600 --> 39:28.600
 going to be a writer.

39:28.600 --> 39:29.600
 Who do you think you are?

39:29.600 --> 39:30.600
 Why do you think you're going to be?

39:30.600 --> 39:31.600
 You're no Stephen King.

39:31.600 --> 39:33.660
 And it's like, why do you have to be Stephen King?

39:33.660 --> 39:37.360
 Why can't you just be a mediocre, crappy writer making the rent?

39:37.360 --> 39:38.560
 The best that you can be.

39:38.560 --> 39:39.840
 But even that is an amazing accomplishment.

39:39.840 --> 39:40.840
 Yeah, absolutely.

39:40.840 --> 39:44.000
 If I don't have to go to an office and I write books that not that many people read, this

39:44.000 --> 39:49.080
 is the story of my life, at the same time, I do have pride because I made this happen.

39:49.080 --> 39:50.080
 You can be the best version.

39:50.080 --> 39:53.280
 I mean, this is a cliche, but you can be the best version of yourself.

39:53.280 --> 39:54.700
 It's not a competition.

39:54.700 --> 39:59.280
 And yet our Jewish mothers, that's not what they aspire us to be.

39:59.280 --> 40:04.640
 They aspire us to be the best version of what they imagine, what the culture imagines, what

40:04.640 --> 40:09.640
 society imagined, not what, it's not about you in their minds.

40:09.640 --> 40:12.800
 And I've seen it, I see it all around me.

40:12.800 --> 40:15.700
 People putting their kids down, putting themselves down.

40:15.700 --> 40:16.700
 It's not healthy.

40:16.700 --> 40:19.080
 I've never told this story, I'm going to tell it now.

40:19.080 --> 40:24.160
 When I graduated college, I was a temp for a while because I didn't know what I wanted

40:24.160 --> 40:25.160
 to do.

40:25.160 --> 40:26.160
 Right?

40:26.160 --> 40:27.160
 And when you're a temp, it's like playing roulette.

40:27.160 --> 40:31.480
 You're going to have jobs that pay well, that suck, and pay well that are great or that

40:31.480 --> 40:35.020
 are great that don't pay well and suck and pay poorly.

40:35.020 --> 40:38.560
 But it's you and you're 21, you have that kind of space.

40:38.560 --> 40:43.160
 And my grandmother was talking to her brother, you know, he's talking about his kids, she's

40:43.160 --> 40:45.820
 talking about me, she's, you know, from Odessa.

40:45.820 --> 40:50.740
 And she told me she lied to him about how much money I was making.

40:50.740 --> 40:54.000
 And that's something I've never brought up and it still hurts me.

40:54.000 --> 41:02.560
 Because it's like, your approval of me should be a function of my character, my happiness.

41:02.560 --> 41:06.920
 And the fact that you feel ashamed over how much money I'm making, especially at this

41:06.920 --> 41:11.560
 point in my life, I thought was very, really misplaced priorities.

41:11.560 --> 41:12.560
 Yeah, absolutely.

41:12.560 --> 41:13.560
 I don't know.

41:13.560 --> 41:15.400
 I don't know what to make of that.

41:15.400 --> 41:23.160
 I think there's a huge benefit to the humility, terms aside, for believing that others can

41:23.160 --> 41:24.160
 teach you a lot.

41:24.160 --> 41:25.160
 Everybody, everybody can teach you a lot.

41:25.160 --> 41:26.160
 I think we all agree on that.

41:26.160 --> 41:27.160
 I just mentioned that, the mechanic.

41:27.160 --> 41:28.160
 No, you do.

41:28.160 --> 41:29.160
 Exactly.

41:29.160 --> 41:30.160
 Exactly the point.

41:30.160 --> 41:37.760
 But for that, I do believe you have to not constantly sort of break your ego apart and

41:37.760 --> 41:43.880
 constantly question whether you know anything about this world and sort of there's a negativity

41:43.880 --> 41:46.800
 with it that I think is very useful.

41:46.800 --> 41:50.920
 And it's also very fulfilling, just constantly.

41:50.920 --> 41:51.920
 I don't know.

41:51.920 --> 41:52.920
 It's the other way around.

41:52.920 --> 41:58.340
 I find that the more, the more I know, the more I know I know, the easier it is for me

41:58.340 --> 42:00.360
 to learn from other people.

42:00.360 --> 42:06.600
 The broader a context I have, the more curious I become, the more areas I know.

42:06.600 --> 42:10.440
 You know, it's true that the more you know, the more areas you know you don't know.

42:10.440 --> 42:14.680
 And the more I find myself attracted to people who can teach me something about things I

42:14.680 --> 42:15.680
 don't know.

42:15.680 --> 42:21.520
 Whereas if I was ignorant, if I truly believed I didn't know anything, I don't know how I

42:21.520 --> 42:22.520
 would live.

42:22.520 --> 42:28.640
 It would really completely challenge everything, everything about life for me.

42:28.640 --> 42:29.740
 Where would I even start?

42:29.740 --> 42:31.000
 You wouldn't know where to start.

42:31.000 --> 42:36.200
 So no, I think, and if you don't recognize what you know, you don't have a full appreciation

42:36.200 --> 42:37.700
 of yourself.

42:37.700 --> 42:41.680
 So really building a recognition of what do I know, right?

42:41.680 --> 42:45.640
 And how much do I know is really crucial to living.

42:45.640 --> 42:49.840
 And I'll tell you something else that furthers my life enormously is when you reach a certain

42:49.840 --> 42:53.480
 point in your career in your life, and you're talking to people who are a lot younger, and

42:53.480 --> 42:57.160
 they might be smart, driven, intelligent, they lack data.

42:57.160 --> 43:00.080
 When you're 23, you don't know how to speak corporate, you don't know what the code words

43:00.080 --> 43:01.080
 are.

43:01.080 --> 43:05.400
 So if I am in a position to sit down with this kid and be like, do X, Y, and Z, and

43:05.400 --> 43:06.940
 here's why I'm coming to this conclusion.

43:06.940 --> 43:09.740
 This is the information that released me this conclusion.

43:09.740 --> 43:13.560
 And I can save them from some of the suffering I went through.

43:13.560 --> 43:15.600
 That is very gratifying.

43:15.600 --> 43:17.480
 It's making the world a better place.

43:17.480 --> 43:22.160
 And it's also the opposite in a sense of humility, because like, in this context, I'm an expert,

43:22.160 --> 43:25.000
 or at least knowledgeable enough that I'm comfortable giving you advice.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
 Yeah.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.840
 And look, everything I do is about me knowing stuff that other people don't.

43:29.840 --> 43:32.860
 And I know a lot of stuff other people don't, and I do.

43:32.860 --> 43:34.400
 And it's fun.

43:34.400 --> 43:35.400
 I'm a teacher.

43:35.400 --> 43:36.640
 I'm a teacher at heart, always have been.

43:36.640 --> 43:42.400
 It turns out, I didn't know that early on, but I like becoming an expert and then trying

43:42.400 --> 43:43.400
 to teach people.

43:43.400 --> 43:45.100
 It doesn't mean I know everything.

43:45.100 --> 43:46.100
 Quite the contrary.

43:46.100 --> 43:49.480
 Again, the more I know, the more I know that the certain things I don't know and the certain

43:49.480 --> 43:51.360
 areas of expertise I don't have.

43:51.360 --> 43:54.080
 But look, pride is a broader concept than that.

43:54.080 --> 43:57.440
 Pride is about, and humility is the opposite of pride.

43:57.440 --> 43:59.040
 And Christianity has that right.

43:59.040 --> 44:01.220
 Pride is about taking your life seriously.

44:01.220 --> 44:07.800
 Pride is about wanting to be really good at living, wanting to have the knowledge.

44:07.800 --> 44:12.880
 And I think what you're describing is, you're describing as I'm constantly learning.

44:12.880 --> 44:16.840
 Sometimes I have to challenge myself, I have to question what I believe in order to gain

44:16.840 --> 44:17.840
 new knowledge.

44:17.840 --> 44:23.160
 That's all good, but that is a drive that is driven by pride.

44:23.160 --> 44:24.160
 You want to know.

44:24.160 --> 44:28.800
 There are lots of people out there that don't want to know, because they don't have that

44:28.800 --> 44:29.800
 pride.

44:29.800 --> 44:34.200
 They don't have that commitment to live, the commitment to achieving something.

44:34.200 --> 44:36.720
 And I'm going to say something else that I think is crucial.

44:36.720 --> 44:40.480
 Humility is extremely important when it comes to politics.

44:40.480 --> 44:46.240
 Because if you feel comfortable telling someone you've never met how to live their life, that

44:46.240 --> 44:48.800
 is a complete lack of humility.

44:48.800 --> 44:51.240
 I lack it, obviously, because I tell people how to live all the time.

44:51.240 --> 44:52.240
 Not through force.

44:52.240 --> 44:53.240
 Not through force.

44:53.240 --> 44:54.240
 That's what I'm saying.

44:54.240 --> 44:55.240
 And of course, not in the concrete.

44:55.240 --> 44:59.200
 I don't tell them, you know, move to, although I do tell them to move to Austin, but I don't

44:59.200 --> 45:01.800
 tell them this is what you do as a profession.

45:01.800 --> 45:03.800
 But I give them the principles, because I think they're principles of how to live.

45:03.800 --> 45:04.800
 They're making the choice.

45:04.800 --> 45:05.800
 That's my point.

45:05.800 --> 45:09.880
 Politically, what I'm saying is it shows a lack of humility to be like, I've never met

45:09.880 --> 45:10.960
 this person.

45:10.960 --> 45:12.960
 This is how I'm going to take money from him.

45:12.960 --> 45:13.960
 I'm going to...

45:13.960 --> 45:14.960
 See, but I don't see that humility.

45:14.960 --> 45:15.960
 There's nothing...

45:15.960 --> 45:16.960
 No, it's the lack of humility.

45:16.960 --> 45:19.680
 No, but it's not even a lack of humility, because it's...

45:19.680 --> 45:21.040
 Who am I to tell them how to live?

45:21.040 --> 45:22.040
 That's lack of humility.

45:22.040 --> 45:23.040
 No, of course you're not.

45:23.040 --> 45:26.400
 No, who are you to tell them how to live is an issue of...

45:26.400 --> 45:30.720
 It's an issue of force and rights and a bunch of different things.

45:30.720 --> 45:32.880
 I don't think it's a lack of humility there.

45:32.880 --> 45:34.960
 I think it's a lack of being a human being.

45:34.960 --> 45:37.160
 It can be both.

45:37.160 --> 45:38.160
 Sure.

45:38.160 --> 45:43.080
 I think it's, who gives you the right to dictate to somebody else how to live their lives?

45:43.080 --> 45:46.120
 Yeah, but that's a lack of humility, if you think you have that right.

45:46.120 --> 45:49.000
 Again, we're using humility in a very different way.

45:49.000 --> 45:53.240
 No, we're using the same way, because the person who feels comfortable, they think,

45:53.240 --> 45:58.680
 I know better than you how you should live your life to the point where I'm a couple

45:58.680 --> 46:01.520
 forcing you, because I know it's gonna be best for you in the long run.

46:01.520 --> 46:02.760
 And the answer is you don't know.

46:02.760 --> 46:04.600
 Right, but that's a lack of humility.

46:04.600 --> 46:09.360
 I think in your mind, you're on humility somehow tied to the Christian concept, the humility,

46:09.360 --> 46:11.240
 and so you're kind of allergic to the word.

46:11.240 --> 46:12.680
 Well, absolutely, because it's part of...

46:12.680 --> 46:19.200
 If you look at the cardinal virtues, the cardinal sins in Christianity, pride is a cardinal

46:19.200 --> 46:25.640
 sin and humility is a cardinal virtue, but they don't mean it in the sense, because they're

46:25.640 --> 46:27.720
 happy to tell you how to live, right?

46:27.720 --> 46:31.760
 They're happy to be philosopher kings over your life, and they believe that's being humble.

46:31.760 --> 46:35.960
 And you should be humble, by the way, in listening to the Pope or listening to God, because what

46:35.960 --> 46:36.960
 do you know?

46:36.960 --> 46:37.960
 You know nothing.

46:37.960 --> 46:41.720
 God knows everything, so you should shut up and do what you're told.

46:41.720 --> 46:43.920
 That's the sense in which I don't think you should be humble.

46:43.920 --> 46:48.080
 I mean, it's a sense in which I always use the example of Abraham, right?

46:48.080 --> 46:53.000
 God comes to Abraham and says, go kill your oldest son, your only son, right?

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
 Your only son.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
 Go kill him.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
 It's like...

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
 And what does Abraham do?

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
 He says, yes, sir.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
 I'll follow...

46:59.000 --> 47:04.080
 And he's a moral hero, for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, he's a moral hero, because he follows

47:04.080 --> 47:06.120
 orders, because he's humble.

47:06.120 --> 47:09.160
 I would tell God to go to hell.

47:09.160 --> 47:10.160
 Screw you.

47:10.160 --> 47:11.160
 I'm not killing my son.

47:11.160 --> 47:12.160
 There's no way.

47:12.160 --> 47:13.160
 But he killed...

47:13.160 --> 47:14.160
 I mean, he killed his son, so it's only fair.

47:14.160 --> 47:17.560
 Well, this is before he killed his son, so I didn't know that, right?

47:17.560 --> 47:21.680
 No, but part of the evil, part of the evil of Christianity is that he's killed his son

47:21.680 --> 47:25.440
 in the most torturous form of death possible.

47:25.440 --> 47:30.400
 I mean, the whole story of Jesus is one of the most immoral, unjust stories ever told,

47:30.400 --> 47:33.080
 and that Christians elevate this to a position of...

47:33.080 --> 47:35.160
 I'd love to have this conversation with Jordan, right?

47:35.160 --> 47:36.160
 Jordan Peterson.

47:36.160 --> 47:37.160
 The idea of elevating...

47:37.160 --> 47:38.160
 That'll never happen.

47:38.160 --> 47:39.160
 No, it won't.

47:39.160 --> 47:43.760
 But elevating Jesus, exactly, elevating Jesus to a superhero status for one of the most

47:43.760 --> 47:47.320
 immoral acts in human history is horrific.

47:47.320 --> 47:52.560
 So yeah, I mean, I'm opposed to God sacrificing his own son, never mind my son, but let him

47:52.560 --> 47:53.560
 go do it to his own son.

47:53.560 --> 47:54.560
 But he didn't kill Isaac.

47:54.560 --> 47:55.560
 He killed the goat.

47:55.560 --> 47:57.640
 The story's about Abraham, not about God.

47:57.640 --> 48:01.560
 First of all, God is mean, right, to put Abraham through that.

48:01.560 --> 48:06.300
 But Abraham has to assume that he's going to kill his son, and he lifts his...

48:06.300 --> 48:08.920
 He's going to do it, and he stopped.

48:08.920 --> 48:10.980
 So the whole point is obedience.

48:10.980 --> 48:12.680
 That's what humility leads to.

48:12.680 --> 48:14.940
 It leads to the opposite of the story you were telling.

48:14.940 --> 48:17.440
 It leads to people saying, yes, I should be told what to do.

48:17.440 --> 48:19.680
 Where's the authority who actually knows something?

48:19.680 --> 48:20.840
 I don't know anything.

48:20.840 --> 48:23.760
 No, I know a lot, and I know a lot about my life.

48:23.760 --> 48:24.760
 The science...

48:24.760 --> 48:27.200
 So you stay away from my life because I have pride in my life.

48:27.200 --> 48:28.920
 The science is settled, right?

48:28.920 --> 48:29.920
 Look at these experts.

48:29.920 --> 48:31.100
 Who am I to argue with these experts?

48:31.100 --> 48:32.800
 They tell me to drink dog pee.

48:32.800 --> 48:33.800
 I'm going to drink...

48:33.800 --> 48:34.800
 What am I, not drink dog pee?

48:34.800 --> 48:35.800
 Yes.

48:35.800 --> 48:36.800
 Yeah.

48:36.800 --> 48:37.800
 Let's go back to the island.

48:37.800 --> 48:38.800
 Speaking of which...

48:38.800 --> 48:39.800
 We're on an island again?

48:39.800 --> 48:40.800
 We're back to the island.

48:40.800 --> 48:41.800
 Manhattan.

48:41.800 --> 48:43.640
 And let's go to the island.

48:43.640 --> 48:44.640
 Let's...

48:44.640 --> 48:47.080
 I live on an island.

48:47.080 --> 48:49.760
 Everything is an island in some context.

48:49.760 --> 48:51.640
 Like Earth is an island.

48:51.640 --> 48:54.040
 This universe is an island in a multiverse.

48:54.040 --> 48:55.440
 There's no multiverses.

48:55.440 --> 48:57.160
 There's only one universe.

48:57.160 --> 48:58.160
 All right.

48:58.160 --> 49:01.520
 So let's invite Jordan Peterson to this island.

49:01.520 --> 49:02.520
 You wish.

49:02.520 --> 49:03.520
 Hold on.

49:03.520 --> 49:04.520
 Hold on a sec.

49:04.520 --> 49:05.520
 Hey, girl.

49:05.520 --> 49:06.520
 Whatcha doing?

49:06.520 --> 49:07.520
 Lex.

49:07.520 --> 49:08.520
 Lex Friedman?

49:08.520 --> 49:09.520
 Look him up.

49:09.520 --> 49:10.520
 Lex who?

49:10.520 --> 49:11.520
 Yeah, exactly.

49:11.520 --> 49:12.520
 I don't know.

49:12.520 --> 49:13.520
 Lex who?

49:13.520 --> 49:18.480
 I don't know, Lex says something as big of a following almost as Jordan does.

49:18.480 --> 49:19.480
 I know Jordan.

49:19.480 --> 49:22.840
 I know his family actually through Jim Keller, who's his relative.

49:22.840 --> 49:23.840
 He's an engineer.

49:23.840 --> 49:32.840
 And I just talked to Sam, who is perhaps a little bit aligned in some sense on your perspective

49:32.840 --> 49:34.560
 on religion and so on.

49:34.560 --> 49:35.880
 So let me ask, is there some...

49:35.880 --> 49:36.880
 Religion, yes.

49:36.880 --> 49:37.880
 But...

49:37.880 --> 49:38.880
 Other things, no.

49:38.880 --> 49:39.880
 Sam Harris.

49:39.880 --> 49:40.880
 Sam Harris, yeah.

49:40.880 --> 49:41.880
 Oh, sorry.

49:41.880 --> 49:42.880
 Sam Harris.

49:42.880 --> 49:43.880
 I thought you were talking about baseball.

49:43.880 --> 49:44.880
 Yeah.

49:44.880 --> 49:45.880
 I just talked to Sam.

49:45.880 --> 49:46.880
 I thought...

49:46.880 --> 49:47.880
 Let's talk about humility.

49:47.880 --> 49:48.880
 Let's talk about humility, Lex.

49:48.880 --> 49:49.880
 My buddy Sam.

49:49.880 --> 49:50.880
 I was talking to Barack.

49:50.880 --> 49:51.880
 You might know him.

49:51.880 --> 49:52.880
 Yeah.

49:52.880 --> 49:53.880
 I simply...

49:53.880 --> 49:55.880
 Humility went out the window.

49:55.880 --> 50:02.480
 I'm just a natural language processing model that I assume that once I mentioned Jordan

50:02.480 --> 50:06.120
 Peterson, it becomes an obvious statement what Sam means.

50:06.120 --> 50:07.680
 This is how neural networks think.

50:07.680 --> 50:11.280
 This is how robots think, Michael, you should know this.

50:11.280 --> 50:13.280
 I thought by now you'd be a scholar.

50:13.280 --> 50:17.600
 For the sake of the audience.

50:17.600 --> 50:18.720
 Humility.

50:18.720 --> 50:21.800
 Everything can teach you something, even the robot.

50:21.800 --> 50:22.800
 Okay.

50:22.800 --> 50:28.000
 So do you think there's value in religion or broader?

50:28.000 --> 50:30.080
 Do you think there's value in myth?

50:30.080 --> 50:33.900
 And as we've been talking about the value of reason, do you think it's possible to argue

50:33.900 --> 50:40.600
 in society as we grow the population of our little island that there's some value of common

50:40.600 --> 50:43.680
 myths, of common stories, of common religion?

50:43.680 --> 50:45.680
 There was value.

50:45.680 --> 50:47.720
 There is no value today.

50:47.720 --> 50:50.940
 So human beings need explanations, right?

50:50.940 --> 50:53.240
 They need a philosophy to guide their life.

50:53.240 --> 50:54.240
 They need ethics.

50:54.240 --> 50:58.160
 They need some explanation of what's going on in the world, right?

50:58.160 --> 51:04.440
 And it's no accident that the early religions had a river god and they had a sun god and

51:04.440 --> 51:09.780
 a moon god because everything they didn't understand, they made god, right?

51:09.780 --> 51:13.040
 So they had multiple gods because they didn't understand very much.

51:13.040 --> 51:19.080
 As human understanding evolved, it increased, as we knew reality more, right?

51:19.080 --> 51:22.700
 We came to the conclusion of, you know, this is very inefficient to have all these gods.

51:22.700 --> 51:24.880
 This is a genius of Judaism, right?

51:24.880 --> 51:28.320
 Let's just have one bucket to put all the stuff we don't know in and we'll call it one

51:28.320 --> 51:32.820
 god and then we don't, as we gain new knowledge, we can just take it out of the bucket that's

51:32.820 --> 51:36.440
 god and put it into the bucket of science.

51:36.440 --> 51:42.160
 At some point, though, at some point, and that point suddenly came during the scientific

51:42.160 --> 51:47.880
 revolution, I think, we could come to the conclusion that, no, we don't need this bucket

51:47.880 --> 51:51.080
 that's called god to explain the things that we don't know.

51:51.080 --> 51:55.920
 We can say we don't know and we're learning.

51:55.920 --> 52:00.560
 And slowly our knowledge is increasing and yet there's a lot more that we don't know,

52:00.560 --> 52:05.860
 but we don't need to throw it into some bucket that's called god in order to have it.

52:05.860 --> 52:09.560
 And I think that's true for morality and it's true for everything else, right?

52:09.560 --> 52:15.340
 As we gain the tools to understand what morality requires, we don't need a set of commandments.

52:15.340 --> 52:19.400
 We can figure out morality from human nature and from reality.

52:19.400 --> 52:22.560
 So I don't think we need religion anymore.

52:22.560 --> 52:29.480
 I think religion needed to die probably about 200 years ago and was dying, I think, up until

52:29.480 --> 52:30.480
 Kant.

52:30.480 --> 52:31.480
 It seemed to be dying.

52:31.480 --> 52:37.240
 Kant's missions, as he says, is to revive religion against attack of reason in the Enlightenment.

52:37.240 --> 52:41.360
 Now mythology is a little different because it depends what you mean by mythology.

52:41.360 --> 52:45.120
 Certainly we need stories and certainly we need art.

52:45.120 --> 52:46.120
 Art is a...

52:46.120 --> 52:50.400
 And Rand writes about this a lot and she's an artist and she writes in...

52:50.400 --> 52:54.600
 I'm a huge fan of the Romantic Manifesto, which I think is one of her underappreciated

52:54.600 --> 52:55.600
 masterpieces.

52:55.600 --> 52:56.600
 Oh, I hate it.

52:56.600 --> 52:57.600
 Okay.

52:57.600 --> 52:58.600
 That's it.

52:58.600 --> 52:59.600
 Okay.

52:59.600 --> 53:03.520
 So I think we have a real need, right?

53:03.520 --> 53:07.720
 As a conceptual being, we have a need for aesthetic experiences.

53:07.720 --> 53:13.560
 We have a need to concretize abstractions, to concretize abstract ideas, to concretize

53:13.560 --> 53:15.400
 the complex nature of the world out there.

53:15.400 --> 53:20.520
 And that's what painting sculpture, to an extent music, but painting sculpture literature

53:20.520 --> 53:22.200
 does for us.

53:22.200 --> 53:27.120
 So to the extent that mythology serves that purpose, it's just art, right?

53:27.120 --> 53:31.840
 To the extent that it serves another purpose, that is that it's a way for the gods to communicate

53:31.840 --> 53:37.000
 with us or it fits some kind of preexisting mental construct that we have as, again, kind

53:37.000 --> 53:38.720
 of a conscientious perspective, right?

53:38.720 --> 53:45.520
 That we have these categorical imperatives and this mythology links up to that.

53:45.520 --> 53:50.320
 Then I think it's false, it's not helpful and destructive.

53:50.320 --> 53:54.080
 So I believe religion today is a destructive force on planet Earth.

53:54.080 --> 53:55.980
 I think it's always been a destructive force.

53:55.980 --> 53:57.640
 It was just a necessary force, right?

53:57.640 --> 53:59.280
 You needed an explanation.

53:59.280 --> 54:01.340
 People needed something to believe in.

54:01.340 --> 54:05.920
 Once you get philosophy and once you get philosophy that starts explaining real life, real world,

54:05.920 --> 54:09.120
 you don't need religion anymore and indeed it becomes a destructive force.

54:09.120 --> 54:12.760
 And you look around the world today, it's an unbelievably destructive force.

54:12.760 --> 54:16.560
 Everywhere it touches is bad for life.

54:16.560 --> 54:21.040
 Again, mythology depends, art is essential, very, very crucial to human existence.

54:21.040 --> 54:26.160
 I mean, I'd love to hear what you think, but you don't see religion and philosophy and

54:26.160 --> 54:28.960
 mythology as just a continuous spectrum?

54:28.960 --> 54:29.960
 Yeah.

54:29.960 --> 54:30.960
 So religion is a primitive form of philosophy.

54:30.960 --> 54:31.960
 It's prephilosophical.

54:31.960 --> 54:39.760
 Where I thought Rand was going to go and he didn't go was that I think he, I agree with

54:39.760 --> 54:43.720
 what he's going to say, Rand was a mythologizer.

54:43.720 --> 54:46.340
 In certain specific contexts Atlas Shrugged is a myth.

54:46.340 --> 54:50.500
 It's one thing to sit down and say, these are the people who move us forward.

54:50.500 --> 54:52.600
 These are the values that are important.

54:52.600 --> 54:57.920
 When you experience it through a story, through a movie, through a TV show, a poem or a painting,

54:57.920 --> 55:02.200
 it affects you in a very visceral, very different way.

55:02.200 --> 55:03.520
 Talk about American history.

55:03.520 --> 55:06.640
 You have the founding fathers, then you have the myth of the founding fathers.

55:06.640 --> 55:13.000
 Now, unfortunately the term myth often means lie, but it could mean in a useful sense,

55:13.000 --> 55:17.480
 an abstraction to help you systematize and concretize ideas.

55:17.480 --> 55:22.200
 So you have the myth of Reagan, you have the myth of Thatcher, the reality often falls

55:22.200 --> 55:23.500
 very short.

55:23.500 --> 55:29.680
 But when you look at how these different figures are mythologized, not only is it very inspirational

55:29.680 --> 55:35.680
 on a personal level, very motivating on a personal level, it's also a great way to concretize

55:35.680 --> 55:39.960
 ideas because just how humans think, it's one thing to think about ideas, but when you

55:39.960 --> 55:44.240
 see someone who embodies these ideas, Miss America, I was saying earlier, I had an aster

55:44.240 --> 55:47.060
 on my show, these people might be jerks.

55:47.060 --> 55:51.040
 But when you look at them, one specific aspect of their life and you extrapolate it, that

55:51.040 --> 55:53.260
 could be to anyone very motivating.

55:53.260 --> 55:59.120
 And it's very important for people to have the belief that happiness and achievement

55:59.120 --> 56:03.480
 is possible because it's very hard to keep that in mind, especially if you're depressed,

56:03.480 --> 56:06.400
 if you're anxious, you're unemployed, you don't have a girlfriend, you think it's going

56:06.400 --> 56:07.560
 to be like this forever.

56:07.560 --> 56:11.200
 And then you look at someone's story and they're like, you know what, that astronaut interview,

56:11.200 --> 56:17.000
 Clayton Anderson, he applied 13 times, didn't get a call back, applied the 14th time, got

56:17.000 --> 56:19.280
 a call back, didn't get the job, 15th time he get the job.

56:19.280 --> 56:25.160
 He talks to kids and he goes, listen, apply 13 times.

56:25.160 --> 56:28.680
 Even if you don't get the call back, you'll still feel I'm doing something.

56:28.680 --> 56:33.600
 And having heard him and the myth of Clayton Anderson, this is going to tell people, yeah,

56:33.600 --> 56:34.600
 you know what?

56:34.600 --> 56:35.600
 That could be me.

56:35.600 --> 56:36.600
 Absolutely.

56:36.600 --> 56:42.440
 And it's not just happiness, it's the fact that virtue works, that the integrity, I mean,

56:42.440 --> 56:43.440
 what's the power of the fountainhead?

56:43.440 --> 56:44.440
 I know you love the fountainhead.

56:44.440 --> 56:51.920
 Part of the power of the fountainhead is how it works, absolute commitment to integrity.

56:51.920 --> 56:55.860
 He is committed to integrity and he's happy.

56:55.860 --> 57:02.820
 And it's very rare in life to see that, to actually see a concrete of that.

57:02.820 --> 57:05.120
 And it's very hard to hold it in your mind.

57:05.120 --> 57:09.320
 Yes, I'm going to be stuck in the quarry or I'm going to be stuck doing this horrible

57:09.320 --> 57:10.320
 job.

57:10.320 --> 57:12.920
 But if I stick to my principles, I'm going to be how it works.

57:12.920 --> 57:13.920
 Now I've got that concrete.

57:13.920 --> 57:18.660
 I know I can immediately relate to that success.

57:18.660 --> 57:21.140
 So I think art is essential.

57:21.140 --> 57:24.760
 And I think in a sense, what we do to Thatcher and Reagan is art.

57:24.760 --> 57:29.980
 You have to be careful in true stories, not to diverge too far from reality because then

57:29.980 --> 57:33.240
 when you discover the reality, you don't want to whitewash it, and particularly when it

57:33.240 --> 57:35.920
 has political implications and then it's really bad.

57:35.920 --> 57:39.120
 So particularly with Reagan and Thatcher, you have to be careful because they want anyone

57:39.120 --> 57:41.920
 near as good as people try to make them out to be.

57:41.920 --> 57:47.960
 But these are powerful, powerful, powerful stories and people are moved by it.

57:47.960 --> 57:51.920
 And the integration of emotion with reason is crucial.

57:51.920 --> 57:57.720
 One of the goals to be happy is to bring your emotions in line with your thinking.

57:57.720 --> 58:03.120
 And I think that stories and arts more broadly, and when I go and see Michelangelo's David,

58:03.120 --> 58:05.780
 it does the same thing to me.

58:05.780 --> 58:08.600
 I can stand up to anybody because he did.

58:08.600 --> 58:10.980
 And look, he succeeded.

58:10.980 --> 58:13.000
 And it makes sense that he could.

58:13.000 --> 58:18.000
 So this is a really interesting idea of bringing your emotion in line with your thinking, with

58:18.000 --> 58:19.120
 your reasoning.

58:19.120 --> 58:23.520
 So Ben Shapiro famously has this saying, how do you like that transition, Michael?

58:23.520 --> 58:24.520
 Give me props.

58:24.520 --> 58:25.520
 I know you do.

58:25.520 --> 58:26.520
 He's not Ben, it's Ben Shapiro.

58:26.520 --> 58:27.520
 Yeah.

58:27.520 --> 58:28.520
 Someone is not taking your calls.

58:28.520 --> 58:29.520
 Benny.

58:29.520 --> 58:35.840
 I guess it's a daily, don't take the caller.

58:35.840 --> 58:37.680
 Back to the island with the murder.

58:37.680 --> 58:38.680
 I think we know.

58:38.680 --> 58:39.680
 Murder Island.

58:39.680 --> 58:42.040
 We would know who would be committing the murder.

58:42.040 --> 58:44.400
 I have the suit for it.

58:44.400 --> 58:49.000
 So he has the saying of facts don't care about your feelings.

58:49.000 --> 58:56.560
 And I've always felt badly about that statement somehow, like it was incomplete.

58:56.560 --> 59:01.960
 So it's interesting that you mentioned bringing your emotions in line with your thinking.

59:01.960 --> 59:03.840
 What do you think about that statement?

59:03.840 --> 59:05.320
 I got this one.

59:05.320 --> 59:16.320
 What Ben is doing in a loose way is attacking Kantianism because Kant, it's almost impossible

59:16.320 --> 59:21.240
 for Westerners who aren't schooled in this to understand the idea of philosophical idealism

59:21.240 --> 59:25.760
 because it sounds so crazy that you're like, these great minds of all time can't really

59:25.760 --> 59:26.760
 be saying this.

59:26.760 --> 59:27.760
 I must be missing something.

59:27.760 --> 59:32.880
 So when we hear idealism, we think John F. Kennedy is a good example.

59:32.880 --> 59:33.880
 You aspire things.

59:33.880 --> 59:35.720
 You think life can be better than it is.

59:35.720 --> 59:38.080
 That's not what it means in a philosophical sense.

59:38.080 --> 59:43.820
 In philosophical idealism, it means ideas are more real than reality.

59:43.820 --> 59:47.000
 That I have this idea, then this comes along.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.640
 It's the reality that isn't correct.

59:49.640 --> 59:50.640
 My idea is still correct.

59:50.640 --> 59:53.780
 A good example of this that you see all the time on the internet is when they refer to

59:53.780 --> 59:58.640
 Mitt Romney and John McCain as rhinos, Republicans in name only.

59:58.640 --> 1:00:01.700
 And it's like, who is more a real Republican?

1:00:01.700 --> 1:00:07.220
 The nominee of the party, the Senator, the governor of the party, or some person in your

1:00:07.220 --> 1:00:11.080
 mind who has never existed and there's no evidence for them existing.

1:00:11.080 --> 1:00:16.800
 So what Kant did is he bifurcated reality into what we see around us, the phenomenal

1:00:16.800 --> 1:00:19.360
 world, but then it's inferior.

1:00:19.360 --> 1:00:25.640
 The real world, the noumenal world, we can't access it because we have eyes.

1:00:25.640 --> 1:00:29.440
 We only see the thing as it appears, not as it is in itself.

1:00:29.440 --> 1:00:33.200
 And because of this, everything we know is a shadow and is secondary.

1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:35.320
 And that's Plato, straight out of Plato.

1:00:35.320 --> 1:00:38.360
 And the real reality is this realm of ideas.

1:00:38.360 --> 1:00:44.000
 So when Ben is saying facts don't care about your feelings, what he is really saying is

1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:45.360
 reality comes first.

1:00:45.360 --> 1:00:48.800
 Your feelings have to be a response or a reaction to it.

1:00:48.800 --> 1:00:50.720
 You can't say, this is how I feel.

1:00:50.720 --> 1:00:52.240
 This table doesn't care.

1:00:52.240 --> 1:00:54.040
 You can yell at it all day long.

1:00:54.040 --> 1:00:57.560
 It will still be indifferent to your emotional state because it comes first.

1:00:57.560 --> 1:00:59.160
 So it's a great statement.

1:00:59.160 --> 1:01:04.320
 I think he's cribbing it from Ayn Rand in a sense, and there's a sense in which he is.

1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:07.000
 I mean, who popularized that kind of idea?

1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.320
 And Ben has read Ayn Rand quite extensively.

1:01:09.320 --> 1:01:10.320
 Not enough.

1:01:10.320 --> 1:01:11.320
 Not enough.

1:01:11.320 --> 1:01:12.320
 Well.

1:01:12.320 --> 1:01:13.320
 Not enough to reference her.

1:01:13.320 --> 1:01:14.320
 That's the way the army goes.

1:01:14.320 --> 1:01:15.320
 So yeah, obviously.

1:01:15.320 --> 1:01:19.560
 He may be read enough, but didn't understand enough.

1:01:19.560 --> 1:01:24.640
 But so it's absolutely reality.

1:01:24.640 --> 1:01:29.520
 Reality is unaffected by your emotional state and your feelings about it.

1:01:29.520 --> 1:01:35.120
 And this is a great claim against the idealism, the philosophical idealism of much of the

1:01:35.120 --> 1:01:36.480
 world out there, both left and right.

1:01:36.480 --> 1:01:40.520
 I think politically, culturally, the left and right are detached from reality.

1:01:40.520 --> 1:01:44.560
 They live in a different dimension, in a different space that they are creating in their own

1:01:44.560 --> 1:01:47.160
 minds that has nothing to do with the real world.

1:01:47.160 --> 1:01:52.680
 And when they fail, they make stuff up to justify their failure, right?

1:01:52.680 --> 1:02:01.120
 So all of really the ideas that are promulgated today on both sides are this kind of detached

1:02:01.120 --> 1:02:02.120
 from reality.

1:02:02.120 --> 1:02:07.320
 We're putting emotions or ideas before reality itself.

1:02:07.320 --> 1:02:11.360
 But I believe that emotions are responses.

1:02:11.360 --> 1:02:17.320
 The responses to reality conditioned by our existing concepts.

1:02:17.320 --> 1:02:20.200
 You're going to have to talk slowly to talk emotions to Lex because he doesn't really

1:02:20.200 --> 1:02:21.200
 understand what that is.

1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:22.200
 I don't understand.

1:02:22.200 --> 1:02:24.400
 That's a really, you got to really taste your words.

1:02:24.400 --> 1:02:25.920
 But he's big on love?

1:02:25.920 --> 1:02:26.920
 What is love?

1:02:26.920 --> 1:02:27.920
 But he's big on love?

1:02:27.920 --> 1:02:28.920
 He's trying to learn.

1:02:28.920 --> 1:02:29.920
 Pretty big on love.

1:02:29.920 --> 1:02:32.520
 I'm all in, I'm a love maximalist.

1:02:32.520 --> 1:02:36.800
 I mean, I could create, we could create an environment on this island where you would

1:02:36.800 --> 1:02:38.200
 really feel emotions.

1:02:38.200 --> 1:02:40.120
 Like fear is an emotion.

1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:41.120
 We could.

1:02:41.120 --> 1:02:42.680
 That's the metaphysical terror.

1:02:42.680 --> 1:02:47.280
 We could easily terrorize you to the point where you felt fear, right?

1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:49.760
 So we could teach him about emotion.

1:02:49.760 --> 1:02:51.280
 But emotions are a response to reality.

1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:54.960
 So some people, for example, you could take five different people and show them exactly

1:02:54.960 --> 1:02:55.960
 the same thing.

1:02:55.960 --> 1:03:00.600
 And some of them would feel fear and some of them would actually feel indifferent and

1:03:00.600 --> 1:03:03.720
 other people might feel love, right?

1:03:03.720 --> 1:03:09.880
 I think Leonard Peacock uses the example of looking through a microscope and seeing a,

1:03:09.880 --> 1:03:11.560
 I don't know, a virus or bacteria.

1:03:11.560 --> 1:03:13.880
 And for one, it's a scientist, he's made a new discovery.

1:03:13.880 --> 1:03:17.520
 He feels pride and love and awe.

1:03:17.520 --> 1:03:22.240
 The one has no clue, right, and he's looking at this and it means nothing to them and somebody

1:03:22.240 --> 1:03:26.600
 else might look at it and it's a bacteria and they feel fear because of what it could

1:03:26.600 --> 1:03:27.600
 do to them.

1:03:27.600 --> 1:03:33.260
 So it's conditioned by what you know, what your values are and your level of knowledge

1:03:33.260 --> 1:03:35.880
 and what the thing is out there in reality.

1:03:35.880 --> 1:03:40.560
 And it's that into, so your emotions respond to that.

1:03:40.560 --> 1:03:48.360
 So aligning your emotions with your reason is making sure that your emotions are really

1:03:48.360 --> 1:03:53.900
 conditioned by what you know explicitly versus what you've internalized implicitly that

1:03:53.900 --> 1:03:55.880
 you might not agree with anymore.

1:03:55.880 --> 1:04:02.160
 You know, things might happen in your childhood and they probably do, right, where you get

1:04:02.160 --> 1:04:03.160
 a trauma.

1:04:03.160 --> 1:04:09.320
 I don't know, I'm afraid of dogs and maybe when I was a five year old, some dogs jumped

1:04:09.320 --> 1:04:11.440
 at me and I don't even remember it, right?

1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:16.120
 But I came to a conclusion when I was five, dogs bad, dogs dangerous, right?

1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:20.880
 And now anytime I see a dog, oh my God, that bringing my emotions aligned with reality,

1:04:20.880 --> 1:04:26.160
 right, with my ideas is no, now I understand dogs don't have to be scary.

1:04:26.160 --> 1:04:30.920
 I can work through this and there are various techniques and hopefully if there is such

1:04:30.920 --> 1:04:35.680
 a science of psychology, but in psychology to get you to the point where you can get

1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:40.800
 rid of that fear and align your emotion now with your explicit ideas, and that's what

1:04:40.800 --> 1:04:41.800
 I mean by that.

1:04:41.800 --> 1:04:45.280
 And let me build on that, talking about your friend Putin, I think I mentioned this before

1:04:45.280 --> 1:04:47.760
 at least maybe on the show, he was meeting with Angela Merkel.

1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:48.760
 Oh, Vladimir, please.

1:04:48.760 --> 1:04:50.880
 Yeah, Vlad, my boy Vlad.

1:04:50.880 --> 1:04:55.800
 He was meeting with Angela Merkel, Angela Merkel has a fear of dogs, so he brought out

1:04:55.800 --> 1:05:00.400
 his big Labrador Retriever, now for people who don't know, Labradors are very big dogs,

1:05:00.400 --> 1:05:03.520
 but they're also like the least aggressive, it's like you could punch them in the face,

1:05:03.520 --> 1:05:04.960
 they don't care.

1:05:04.960 --> 1:05:10.440
 That dog is not going to be more likely to attack just because she's scared.

1:05:10.440 --> 1:05:15.500
 And I know they say animals can sense fear, domesticated dogs, if they see you're scared,

1:05:15.500 --> 1:05:17.520
 they're not going to be aggressive, they're going to try to play.

1:05:17.520 --> 1:05:22.240
 I remember when I was a kid, there was this dog, Rex, this German Shepherd, I'm five,

1:05:22.240 --> 1:05:26.040
 this dog is gigantic, and I'm sitting on the couch, the German Shepherds have been bred

1:05:26.040 --> 1:05:29.080
 for intelligence, they're very bright dogs, they're very good with kids, he's sitting

1:05:29.080 --> 1:05:32.160
 next to me, this thing is three times my size.

1:05:32.160 --> 1:05:37.440
 He very gently puts his paw on my leg to be like, kid, he can sense my fear, he's like,

1:05:37.440 --> 1:05:40.920
 I'm not going to do it, I want to be your friend, I'm still freaking out.

1:05:40.920 --> 1:05:45.000
 He licks my hand, it's just very scary, you know, animals are so bright, but that's the

1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:50.280
 thing is, in terms of facts don't care about your feelings, that dog is not more likely

1:05:50.280 --> 1:05:54.560
 to attack someone because their emotion is so intense.

1:05:54.560 --> 1:06:01.120
 It's not that I feel something very strongly, therefore, this thing is more likely to happen.

1:06:01.120 --> 1:06:07.260
 So my intensity of my emotion does not in any way correlate, when you're being irrational,

1:06:07.260 --> 1:06:09.320
 to the likelihood of that thing actually happening.

1:06:09.320 --> 1:06:12.280
 Now, you could have a dog that does respond to your emotion, right?

1:06:12.280 --> 1:06:16.820
 But then it's, but then it's not, that's part of reality, right?

1:06:16.820 --> 1:06:20.320
 That's a fact of reality that certain dogs respond to certain emotions.

1:06:20.320 --> 1:06:25.400
 But isn't this emotion a part of reality, like, okay, let me say a word.

1:06:25.400 --> 1:06:30.640
 So part of that, I would even say, don't let your emotion about your emotion, right, because

1:06:30.640 --> 1:06:36.760
 sometimes you have an emotion about your emotion, don't be repressed, and identify the emotion

1:06:36.760 --> 1:06:41.280
 as reality, and evaluate it, don't judge it, evaluate it.

1:06:41.280 --> 1:06:42.520
 Is it a rational emotion?

1:06:42.520 --> 1:06:47.440
 Is it consistent with my, like, if I'm afraid of these dogs, if I feel that fear, is it

1:06:47.440 --> 1:06:49.240
 rational to be afraid of these dogs?

1:06:49.240 --> 1:06:53.560
 But you're speaking to your own individual trajectory as a human being as you grow through

1:06:53.560 --> 1:06:57.260
 the world and try to understand reality and connect yourself through reason to reality.

1:06:57.260 --> 1:07:02.280
 What I'm talking about is a term like lived experience.

1:07:02.280 --> 1:07:09.880
 When you observe and analyze the, you know, conversations with other people to try to

1:07:09.880 --> 1:07:16.200
 understand how other people see the world, doesn't emotion fundamentally integrate into

1:07:16.200 --> 1:07:17.200
 that?

1:07:17.200 --> 1:07:19.160
 Like, isn't emotion lived experience?

1:07:19.160 --> 1:07:24.200
 So everybody experiences the same reality, but the way they experience it might be very

1:07:24.200 --> 1:07:25.200
 different.

1:07:25.200 --> 1:07:26.200
 And that has to do with what?

1:07:26.200 --> 1:07:27.200
 It doesn't have to do with…

1:07:27.200 --> 1:07:30.840
 With their values, with their conclusions, with their ideas, with their experiences,

1:07:30.840 --> 1:07:31.840
 with a million different things, right?

1:07:31.840 --> 1:07:32.840
 But is it…

1:07:32.840 --> 1:07:35.480
 But at the end of the day, it's about the conclusions that they come to, which are then

1:07:35.480 --> 1:07:37.200
 shaping their emotions.

1:07:37.200 --> 1:07:40.320
 But look, emotions are not something to be avoided or ignored.

1:07:40.320 --> 1:07:43.440
 That is, I can sense your emotions to some extent, right?

1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:44.440
 That's a lie.

1:07:44.440 --> 1:07:45.440
 Okay, it is Lex.

1:07:45.440 --> 1:07:46.440
 I can sense his emotions.

1:07:46.440 --> 1:07:47.440
 Thank you.

1:07:47.440 --> 1:07:48.440
 Yeah.

1:07:48.440 --> 1:07:52.260
 I can sense Michael's emotions, and that's part of the fact of reality, right?

1:07:52.260 --> 1:07:58.760
 So if Michael responds to something that I view as really, really important, right?

1:07:58.760 --> 1:08:03.000
 If we were standing in front of Michelangelo's David, and Michael responds to Michelangelo's

1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:07.920
 David and goes, eh, and turned his back to it and walked away, that would be really meaningful

1:08:07.920 --> 1:08:08.920
 to me, right?

1:08:08.920 --> 1:08:12.640
 That I would respond emotionally to that, and cognitively I would say, what is it about

1:08:12.640 --> 1:08:16.520
 Michael that makes him, you know, respond this way?

1:08:16.520 --> 1:08:17.520
 That is…

1:08:17.520 --> 1:08:18.960
 That gives me a lot of information about him.

1:08:18.960 --> 1:08:22.600
 So emotions are information laden, right?

1:08:22.600 --> 1:08:25.040
 But they are not primary.

1:08:25.040 --> 1:08:29.160
 They are responses, responses to something.

1:08:29.160 --> 1:08:34.480
 So one must be very aware of one's own emotions, recognize them, and analyze them.

1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:38.200
 And one should be aware of other people's emotions, if they're important to you, if

1:08:38.200 --> 1:08:39.200
 they're not important to you.

1:08:39.200 --> 1:08:40.200
 It doesn't matter, right?

1:08:40.200 --> 1:08:43.240
 You don't care about a stranger's emotion, you know, like a stranger walks up to Michael

1:08:43.240 --> 1:08:49.920
 and Michelangelo's David and said, eh, and walks away, and I go, okay, I'm glad you're

1:08:49.920 --> 1:08:50.920
 a stranger.

1:08:50.920 --> 1:08:51.920
 But it's…

1:08:51.920 --> 1:08:56.080
 Now, I don't know what Michael's response to Michelangelo's David was or is, so I'm

1:08:56.080 --> 1:08:57.720
 a little worried about what he's gonna say.

1:08:57.720 --> 1:08:58.720
 You got candy too, that was great.

1:08:58.720 --> 1:08:59.720
 Hey, hey, I thought I was special.

1:08:59.720 --> 1:09:00.720
 Do I get Ukrainian candy?

1:09:00.720 --> 1:09:01.720
 I don't know, I can't read either.

1:09:01.720 --> 1:09:02.720
 What's this say, Joshua?

1:09:02.720 --> 1:09:03.720
 What does that say to him?

1:09:03.720 --> 1:09:04.720
 Is this Ukrainian candy as well?

1:09:04.720 --> 1:09:05.720
 I thought it was sent to me from…

1:09:05.720 --> 1:09:12.720
 Do you know that Atlas Shrugged was the bestselling book in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016?

1:09:12.720 --> 1:09:17.120
 Do you know Atlas Shrugged was translated to Russian by someone who's now a crypto like

1:09:17.120 --> 1:09:20.600
 billionaire and he made like six copies and I have one of them and I sent it to my great

1:09:20.600 --> 1:09:21.600
 grandma.

1:09:21.600 --> 1:09:22.600
 No, they're more than six, but yeah.

1:09:22.600 --> 1:09:23.600
 Oh, but they were like…

1:09:23.600 --> 1:09:24.600
 Because I have a copy too.

1:09:24.600 --> 1:09:25.600
 Okay.

1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:26.600
 Not I personally, the institute has a copy.

1:09:26.600 --> 1:09:28.960
 I sent it to my great grandma and she said, why is he sending me this, I wanna read books

1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:29.960
 about love.

1:09:29.960 --> 1:09:30.960
 And I'm like, you know what?

1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:31.960
 This is about love.

1:09:31.960 --> 1:09:32.960
 Yeah.

1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:33.960
 That's what you should have said.

1:09:33.960 --> 1:09:34.960
 What's that, what does that say?

1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:35.960
 So this says it's…

1:09:35.960 --> 1:09:36.960
 It has vitamins and minerals.

1:09:36.960 --> 1:09:37.960
 If it's in Russian, I don't believe it.

1:09:37.960 --> 1:09:50.880
 It just sounds really strange to read like health information in Russian, I'm already

1:09:50.880 --> 1:09:51.880
 distressed.

1:09:51.880 --> 1:09:53.440
 But look, there's a Yorshik like you have.

1:09:53.440 --> 1:09:54.440
 Exactly.

1:09:54.440 --> 1:09:58.360
 I mean, I'm much, I like Kiev much more than I like Moscow.

1:09:58.360 --> 1:09:59.360
 Wow.

1:09:59.360 --> 1:10:00.360
 Strong words.

1:10:00.360 --> 1:10:02.640
 But this is, this is not, it's like hard candy.

1:10:02.640 --> 1:10:03.640
 I don't know.

1:10:03.640 --> 1:10:07.360
 I think this, some of my friends sent me that's made with blood to give the kids iron.

1:10:07.360 --> 1:10:08.360
 Whose blood?

1:10:08.360 --> 1:10:09.360
 Like cow blood.

1:10:09.360 --> 1:10:10.360
 Oh.

1:10:10.360 --> 1:10:11.360
 Like with chocolate.

1:10:11.360 --> 1:10:12.360
 All right.

1:10:12.360 --> 1:10:13.360
 You can keep it.

1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:14.360
 That's all you.

1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:15.360
 All right.

1:10:15.360 --> 1:10:16.360
 I'm keeping both of these.

1:10:16.360 --> 1:10:18.480
 Can I take something you're talking about with emotion?

1:10:18.480 --> 1:10:23.160
 Something that is very pernicious in terms of emotion is people denying the validity

1:10:23.160 --> 1:10:24.380
 of their own emotions.

1:10:24.380 --> 1:10:28.620
 And here's one example, someone could be in an abusive relationship or have had an

1:10:28.620 --> 1:10:32.780
 abusive childhood and they think, well, I didn't have a black eye.

1:10:32.780 --> 1:10:33.780
 We had dinner on the table.

1:10:33.780 --> 1:10:35.960
 It wasn't abusive because you hear some other story.

1:10:35.960 --> 1:10:41.000
 So they feel their emotion is invalid or like, oh, he never lays hands on me.

1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:42.760
 He gets drunk and is mean to me.

1:10:42.760 --> 1:10:44.700
 He's still basically a good person.

1:10:44.700 --> 1:10:46.240
 You're denying that emotion.

1:10:46.240 --> 1:10:49.240
 And that emotion is a response to something real.

1:10:49.240 --> 1:10:52.200
 There's an expression, I have friends who are in 12 step programs.

1:10:52.200 --> 1:10:56.560
 There's an expression there, which I think is very profound, which is if it's hysterical,

1:10:56.560 --> 1:10:57.560
 it's historical.

1:10:57.560 --> 1:11:03.840
 Meaning if some minor incident is having an extreme disproportionate impact on you, think,

1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:08.160
 ask yourself, why am I responding in such an extreme way to some minor thing?

1:11:08.160 --> 1:11:13.160
 And I will tell you 10 times out of 10, you'll go back and you'll be like, oh, I'm feeling

1:11:13.160 --> 1:11:18.240
 now like I felt when I was eight and my dad came home and he was a total jerk and I didn't

1:11:18.240 --> 1:11:19.240
 do anything wrong.

1:11:19.240 --> 1:11:21.680
 And he thought I had, and I was complete powerless.

1:11:21.680 --> 1:11:23.360
 And now I'm in the same situation, my boss.

1:11:23.360 --> 1:11:27.280
 I'm not that eight year old in one sense I am, in another sense I'm not, but I feel the

1:11:27.280 --> 1:11:28.560
 same way I did as a kid.

1:11:28.560 --> 1:11:32.500
 And this is a very useful mechanism in terms of furthering one's happiness because you

1:11:32.500 --> 1:11:35.360
 kind of deprogram all those things that you picked up as a child.

1:11:35.360 --> 1:11:39.240
 But it's also, you know, if you're feeling something wrong, even though you're trying

1:11:39.240 --> 1:11:42.520
 to rationalize in a way, you know, it's not abusive because he's not hitting me.

1:11:42.520 --> 1:11:46.200
 No, the emotion is telling you something real about what's going on.

1:11:46.200 --> 1:11:50.080
 So acknowledge it and fix the situation, right?

1:11:50.080 --> 1:11:54.420
 So one of the powers emotions give you is they send you signals about something that

1:11:54.420 --> 1:11:57.000
 might not be in cognition yet.

1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:01.520
 And when you examine their emotion, it brings it to cognition and now you can act on it.

1:12:01.520 --> 1:12:06.100
 So maybe the boss is abusive, but I didn't really think of it in those terms of my emotions

1:12:06.100 --> 1:12:07.720
 is sending me signals.

1:12:07.720 --> 1:12:09.400
 And now that I signal it, I'm going to resign.

1:12:09.400 --> 1:12:11.160
 I'm going to find a better, another job.

1:12:11.160 --> 1:12:12.960
 I'm going to complain to his boss or whatever.

1:12:12.960 --> 1:12:14.740
 I'm going to take action.

1:12:14.740 --> 1:12:17.940
 Why do you think Ayn Rand is such a controversial figure?

1:12:17.940 --> 1:12:23.800
 Last time I spoke with you on this particular podcast, the, the amount of emails I've gotten

1:12:23.800 --> 1:12:28.720
 positive and negative and certainly negative, I don't usually get negative emails.

1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:29.720
 Yeah.

1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:31.920
 I can't, I can't relate.

1:12:31.920 --> 1:12:34.480
 I'm sure mine were all positive or only positive.

1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:39.120
 It was mostly women sending pictures for me to forward to you because you didn't send

1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:40.120
 me anything.

1:12:40.120 --> 1:12:43.120
 Oh, it's the wrong email address.

1:12:43.120 --> 1:12:44.120
 Sorry.

1:12:44.120 --> 1:12:45.120
 I kept bouncing.

1:12:45.120 --> 1:12:51.160
 Oh, so this is love.

1:12:51.160 --> 1:12:52.160
 Love hurts.

1:12:52.160 --> 1:12:53.160
 Okay.

1:12:53.160 --> 1:12:54.160
 Yes.

1:12:54.160 --> 1:12:55.160
 No.

1:12:55.160 --> 1:12:56.160
 But why do you think she's such a divisive figure?

1:12:56.160 --> 1:12:59.560
 Why do you think she provokes such emotion in both the positive and the negative side?

1:12:59.560 --> 1:13:02.040
 I'd love to hear both of your viewpoints on this.

1:13:02.040 --> 1:13:05.760
 Well, I think on the negative side and both on the positive and the negative side, I think

1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:08.200
 it's because she's radical.

1:13:08.200 --> 1:13:10.440
 She's consistently radical.

1:13:10.440 --> 1:13:17.720
 She upends the, the premises, the ideas that are prevalent in the culture that were brought

1:13:17.720 --> 1:13:24.440
 up on the, that, that are like, you know, they're like milk and, and, and, you know,

1:13:24.440 --> 1:13:26.640
 the basic stuff that we're, we're growing up.

1:13:26.640 --> 1:13:27.640
 You have to be altruistic.

1:13:27.640 --> 1:13:29.100
 You have to live for other people.

1:13:29.100 --> 1:13:30.400
 That's just basic stuff.

1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:31.400
 Nobody challenges that.

1:13:31.400 --> 1:13:32.480
 Nobody questions it.

1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:37.960
 And if they do question it, they usually question it from the perspective of a cynic or a bad

1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:38.960
 guy.

1:13:38.960 --> 1:13:39.960
 Right.

1:13:39.960 --> 1:13:40.960
 You mentioned the book, the Joker, right.

1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:41.960
 Before we started, right.

1:13:41.960 --> 1:13:44.960
 You know, I'm going to upend the world because I don't care about other people.

1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:45.960
 Right.

1:13:45.960 --> 1:13:49.840
 So, so they're presented with these two alternatives and it's real in people's lives, right?

1:13:49.840 --> 1:13:56.520
 You either live for other people or you're a evil SOB and you know, yeah, most people

1:13:56.520 --> 1:14:00.760
 in either one of those, but the ethic is right here.

1:14:00.760 --> 1:14:02.080
 It's living for other people.

1:14:02.080 --> 1:14:05.560
 And when you challenge that, they have no way cognitively to go with that.

1:14:05.560 --> 1:14:08.680
 And the only place they can go with that cognitively is to the Joker.

1:14:08.680 --> 1:14:09.980
 It's the evil guy.

1:14:09.980 --> 1:14:14.040
 It's the somebody who wants to smash everything and destroy because they don't have this alternative

1:14:14.040 --> 1:14:19.740
 conception of, oh no, you can be rationally self interested and that does not involve

1:14:19.740 --> 1:14:25.460
 destruction and that does not involve, you know, just exploiting other people.

1:14:25.460 --> 1:14:27.440
 They can't conceptualize that.

1:14:27.440 --> 1:14:30.060
 It's not in their framework.

1:14:30.060 --> 1:14:34.220
 So it's the fact that she's so consistently on the side of self interest, for example,

1:14:34.220 --> 1:14:37.640
 on the side of capitalism, on the side of freedom.

1:14:37.640 --> 1:14:42.560
 It's the fact that she dismisses faith to the extent that she does or to the extent

1:14:42.560 --> 1:14:47.360
 that I do, right, that alienates people because that is completely different from what they

1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:48.360
 brought up.

1:14:48.360 --> 1:14:52.840
 Now the flip side of that is it's also really interesting to some people.

1:14:52.840 --> 1:14:56.900
 So you know, a lot of, you got some positives, right?

1:14:56.900 --> 1:14:58.640
 And I got a lot of positives from that appearance.

1:14:58.640 --> 1:15:02.280
 I know a lot of people came to my podcast because I appeared on your show.

1:15:02.280 --> 1:15:03.280
 Why?

1:15:03.280 --> 1:15:08.520
 Because they hear something that's completely fresh, new, different, they've never heard

1:15:08.520 --> 1:15:09.520
 before.

1:15:09.520 --> 1:15:13.640
 It appeals to something in them that maybe, you know, a lot of people say I read Ayn Rand

1:15:13.640 --> 1:15:15.620
 and it confirmed everything I believed.

1:15:15.620 --> 1:15:16.620
 Now for me it didn't.

1:15:16.620 --> 1:15:17.620
 It was the opposite.

1:15:17.620 --> 1:15:21.480
 It turned upside down everything I believed, but there are a lot of people out there that

1:15:21.480 --> 1:15:26.360
 do have a sense that something's wrong in the world, that altruism is wrong, that socialism,

1:15:26.360 --> 1:15:29.960
 just the stuff and religion is wrong, but they don't have an alternative.

1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:31.280
 It hasn't coalesced.

1:15:31.280 --> 1:15:35.640
 And they listen to a lot of podcasts because they're trying to get ideas of what is it

1:15:35.640 --> 1:15:37.560
 that I'm sensing that's wrong out there?

1:15:37.560 --> 1:15:42.080
 And suddenly somebody comes out and gives them some clear explanation of things and

1:15:42.080 --> 1:15:45.240
 they go, wow, that's what I've been looking for my whole life.

1:15:45.240 --> 1:15:48.280
 So that's the positive for people.

1:15:48.280 --> 1:15:53.000
 You know, and I read Ayn Rand, it just all made sense.

1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:59.080
 It all clicked and it all, and it made clear that everything I believed to that point was

1:15:59.080 --> 1:16:00.080
 just wrong.

1:16:00.080 --> 1:16:02.280
 It just didn't, it didn't integrate.

1:16:02.280 --> 1:16:05.720
 And I always knew to some extent it didn't integrate, but there was no alternative, so

1:16:05.720 --> 1:16:06.720
 I believed it.

1:16:06.720 --> 1:16:07.720
 What else was there?

1:16:07.720 --> 1:16:12.680
 I remember saying to myself as a kid, probably 15, why should I, why is this, why is morality

1:16:12.680 --> 1:16:14.040
 all about other people?

1:16:14.040 --> 1:16:15.040
 Why is that?

1:16:15.040 --> 1:16:17.480
 Well, that's just the way it is, right?

1:16:17.480 --> 1:16:19.160
 And I couldn't, couldn't come up with an explanation.

1:16:19.160 --> 1:16:23.400
 She gave me the explanation and she gave me the explanation why it's wrong to do that.

1:16:23.400 --> 1:16:25.900
 And I think, so I think that's why people respond.

1:16:25.900 --> 1:16:27.360
 It's just too radical.

1:16:27.360 --> 1:16:32.080
 It can't fit into their cognitive framework that they have been brought up on, that they've

1:16:32.080 --> 1:16:35.360
 been educated on, that just their whole life revolves around.

1:16:35.360 --> 1:16:40.480
 Michael, you don't bring up Ayn Rand that much in conversation, except as kind of references

1:16:40.480 --> 1:16:44.400
 every once in a while as part of the humor of just the general flow in the music of the

1:16:44.400 --> 1:16:45.920
 way you like to talk.

1:16:45.920 --> 1:16:52.000
 Well, why do you think you don't integrate her into your philosophy when you're like

1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:54.320
 explaining ideas and all those kinds of things?

1:16:54.320 --> 1:17:01.440
 Like, why is she not, you know, a popular reference point for discussion of ideas?

1:17:01.440 --> 1:17:05.400
 Because I, I don't know if Yaron's going to agree with or can agree with me.

1:17:05.400 --> 1:17:09.280
 I think for a certain percentage of the population, actually I talked to someone from the Ayn

1:17:09.280 --> 1:17:12.720
 Rand Institute, I forgot his name, older guy with glasses and he didn't disagree with me.

1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:13.720
 He said, this is changing.

1:17:13.720 --> 1:17:17.720
 He said, I think for a certain percentage of the population who are uninformed about

1:17:17.720 --> 1:17:23.160
 her work, higher than 10%, less than 50%, you mentioned Ayn Rand, they have been trained

1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:25.640
 to think this is identical Scientology.

1:17:25.640 --> 1:17:28.560
 So as soon as her name comes up, it's like, okay, I'm out the door.

1:17:28.560 --> 1:17:30.440
 I'm not going to have anything to do with this.

1:17:30.440 --> 1:17:32.080
 And everyone who follows her is a crazy person.

1:17:32.080 --> 1:17:33.960
 That's one thing that has happened.

1:17:33.960 --> 1:17:40.240
 Another thing is Rand in her personality was very aggressive and antagonistic.

1:17:40.240 --> 1:17:45.080
 She was for a long time, the lone voice in the wilderness being like, this isn't like

1:17:45.080 --> 1:17:50.040
 one of her big adversaries in a certain sense is Milton Friedman.

1:17:50.040 --> 1:17:55.760
 And she really hated how Milton Friedman was like, oh, you know, having rent control is

1:17:55.760 --> 1:17:56.760
 inefficient.

1:17:56.760 --> 1:17:58.340
 And she's like, inefficient?

1:17:58.340 --> 1:18:02.400
 We're talking about mass homelessness and people dying.

1:18:02.400 --> 1:18:06.760
 And you're talking about this, like what color tie goes with this color shirt?

1:18:06.760 --> 1:18:07.760
 Are you insane?

1:18:07.760 --> 1:18:09.840
 And in fact, it's hilarious.

1:18:09.840 --> 1:18:12.800
 There was an organization called the Foundation for Economic Education fee.

1:18:12.800 --> 1:18:15.680
 Leonard Reed was the head of this.

1:18:15.680 --> 1:18:18.960
 And there were a series of letters and she was helping him.

1:18:18.960 --> 1:18:22.600
 She was much more philosophically grounded in certain contexts than he was.

1:18:22.600 --> 1:18:27.440
 And there was an essay, a pamphlet that he published called Roofs or Ceilings.

1:18:27.440 --> 1:18:32.200
 It was cowritten by Milton Friedman, later Nobel prize winner and George Stigler, also

1:18:32.200 --> 1:18:33.880
 later Nobel prize winner.

1:18:33.880 --> 1:18:39.080
 And basically the argument was, well, if the government controls all housing, how's that

1:18:39.080 --> 1:18:40.280
 going to work out?

1:18:40.280 --> 1:18:43.840
 And she's sitting there and she's typing in all caps.

1:18:43.840 --> 1:18:49.160
 So you know, she's holding on the shift key and doing this on a typewriter and being like

1:18:49.160 --> 1:18:50.160
 how?

1:18:50.160 --> 1:18:55.760
 And you can imagine her with her cigarette holder, apoplectic, being like, how is an

1:18:55.760 --> 1:19:04.880
 organization ostensibly devoted to free enterprise discussing this Stalinist idea in the most

1:19:04.880 --> 1:19:06.160
 casual of terms?

1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:07.300
 She's like, have I taught you not?

1:19:07.300 --> 1:19:13.000
 And what's amazing is, so at Fee, they only have her letters because she sent them to

1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:14.000
 Reed.

1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:16.280
 The Ayn Rand Institute must have Leonard Reed's letters.

1:19:16.280 --> 1:19:21.160
 I was able to, knowing Rand enough, predict exactly what the conversation would go like

1:19:21.160 --> 1:19:26.300
 because he also did something she didn't approve of, which is he asked other people for feedback

1:19:26.300 --> 1:19:27.300
 on her work.

1:19:27.300 --> 1:19:29.640
 And she goes, I gave this to you to read.

1:19:29.640 --> 1:19:33.120
 Who are you shopping around to some jerk that I don't, I need their approval.

1:19:33.120 --> 1:19:34.120
 What are you doing?

1:19:34.120 --> 1:19:38.200
 So it was a very interesting situation, but so that's one issue.

1:19:38.200 --> 1:19:40.480
 I remember this is Ayn Rand when she's young.

1:19:40.480 --> 1:19:41.480
 She wasn't that young.

1:19:41.480 --> 1:19:42.480
 It was in the 40s.

1:19:42.480 --> 1:19:43.480
 She's relatively young, right?

1:19:43.480 --> 1:19:44.480
 Yeah.

1:19:44.480 --> 1:19:45.480
 It's before Atlas Shrugged.

1:19:45.480 --> 1:19:46.480
 It was before Atlas Shrugged.

1:19:46.480 --> 1:19:47.480
 So it's before she's super famous.

1:19:47.480 --> 1:19:55.200
 And before this is, the found has been published, but you know, she's trying to work with others

1:19:55.200 --> 1:19:57.200
 and they are disappointing her left and right.

1:19:57.200 --> 1:19:58.200
 Yeah.

1:19:58.200 --> 1:20:06.720
 And also when you are a, what she takes away from bad people is you have these kids, right?

1:20:06.720 --> 1:20:09.160
 And you're going to sit down with them and they're going to be like, yeah, I'm going

1:20:09.160 --> 1:20:10.240
 to take your guns.

1:20:10.240 --> 1:20:12.760
 I'm going to lock you in your house.

1:20:12.760 --> 1:20:16.600
 I'm going to take 60% of your income and all this other stuff.

1:20:16.600 --> 1:20:21.040
 And they might, up to reading Rand, they might sit down and have a discussion.

1:20:21.040 --> 1:20:23.400
 And Rand goes, Hey, you know what?

1:20:23.400 --> 1:20:25.240
 You didn't have to give them an answer.

1:20:25.240 --> 1:20:27.100
 You could say, go to hell.

1:20:27.100 --> 1:20:32.840
 We're not having this conversation and you have no right to one second of my life.

1:20:32.840 --> 1:20:35.480
 And this is not a legitimate opener.

1:20:35.480 --> 1:20:36.820
 This is a declaration of war.

1:20:36.820 --> 1:20:40.040
 This isn't like, it's not like if I sit down with you, I run like, Hey, Ron, here are my

1:20:40.040 --> 1:20:41.040
 plans for your wife.

1:20:41.040 --> 1:20:42.040
 Go to hell.

1:20:42.040 --> 1:20:43.040
 Yeah.

1:20:43.040 --> 1:20:44.040
 This isn't a conversation we're having.

1:20:44.040 --> 1:20:45.400
 Oh, I'm going to make you unsafe in your house.

1:20:45.400 --> 1:20:46.400
 What?

1:20:46.400 --> 1:20:47.400
 This is not a discussion.

1:20:47.400 --> 1:20:52.000
 So what happens is these people who five minutes ago were able to have a debate with this kid

1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:54.260
 because people read Rand when they're young often.

1:20:54.260 --> 1:20:57.120
 And now that kid is like, yeah, I'm not even talking to you.

1:20:57.120 --> 1:20:58.360
 It's her fault.

1:20:58.360 --> 1:21:03.260
 Whereas in reality, it's that person's fault because that person had no right, although

1:21:03.260 --> 1:21:06.860
 they've been trained to the contrary of our culture to believe, yeah, I'm going to sit

1:21:06.860 --> 1:21:11.020
 down and we're just going to equally have a discussion over your own life.

1:21:11.020 --> 1:21:14.080
 And you have one vote and I have one vote and we're going to know Lex has a vote and

1:21:14.080 --> 1:21:18.020
 that's just how it's going to be and Rand's not having it.

1:21:18.020 --> 1:21:19.760
 So I think those are two issues.

1:21:19.760 --> 1:21:22.240
 And there's some other things which, which I don't need to get into.

1:21:22.240 --> 1:21:27.840
 But I, I, because one of the things that Rand said consisting of her life is that her philosophy

1:21:27.840 --> 1:21:29.980
 is an integrated whole, right?

1:21:29.980 --> 1:21:33.720
 So to be an objectivist isn't just like, I like Atlas shrugged.

1:21:33.720 --> 1:21:37.160
 It means I accept objectivism as a totality.

1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:43.560
 Since I do not, I don't, I think it is proper to be respectful to her wishes and not constantly

1:21:43.560 --> 1:21:46.440
 be, especially given that I've somewhat of a platform to be like Ayn Rand, Ayn Rand,

1:21:46.440 --> 1:21:50.360
 Ayn Rand, because I don't think Ayn Rand would have liked it if I was talking about Ayn Rand

1:21:50.360 --> 1:21:51.360
 this much.

1:21:51.360 --> 1:21:54.300
 So how do you, how do you deprogram?

1:21:54.300 --> 1:21:58.540
 Because I don't like to bring up Ayn Rand just because I do see what, like how people

1:21:58.540 --> 1:22:00.000
 roll their eyes essentially.

1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:03.280
 So how do you, what's the upside, exactly.

1:22:03.280 --> 1:22:08.520
 But what is that pro, can we, can you speak to that programming that people have?

1:22:08.520 --> 1:22:12.500
 I mean, look, at the end of the day, if you talk about the ideas and the ideas make sense

1:22:12.500 --> 1:22:15.680
 and people are attracted to the ideas, then you say, oh, by the way, and this came from

1:22:15.680 --> 1:22:18.560
 Ayn Rand, that's how you deprogram them, right?

1:22:18.560 --> 1:22:23.160
 If you make the ideas prevalent in the culture, if people start viewing self interest as something

1:22:23.160 --> 1:22:27.800
 that's kind of, that's interesting and worthwhile and something worth investigating, and they

1:22:27.800 --> 1:22:32.940
 said, oh, that came from Ayn Rand, then I think, I think then we'll, we'll deprogram

1:22:32.940 --> 1:22:36.340
 them and get them and get them changing their minds about these things.

1:22:36.340 --> 1:22:40.960
 And also, you know, going on shows where people are going to watch your show no matter who

1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:41.960
 you bring on.

1:22:41.960 --> 1:22:42.960
 Right.

1:22:42.960 --> 1:22:48.440
 So, uh, even though now you do, you, if you put, you put Ayn Rand in the title that immediately

1:22:48.440 --> 1:22:52.360
 reduces the number of people who watch, so, so in the future you shouldn't, but, uh, you

1:22:52.360 --> 1:22:56.200
 put Michael Malice in the title and then at least the, the female population, the female

1:22:56.200 --> 1:23:01.000
 to, you know, absolutely, just to see, but so, so you go and you try to make them as

1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:04.240
 credible as possible to as many people as possible over time.

1:23:04.240 --> 1:23:05.240
 It takes time.

1:23:05.240 --> 1:23:08.420
 And ultimately, I don't think the culture will have this response to her.

1:23:08.420 --> 1:23:12.000
 They might still disagree with her, but I think over time, and already you're seeing

1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:16.360
 it, younger people, I think today are far less, there was a generation who never read

1:23:16.360 --> 1:23:19.920
 Ayn Rand and was like this, bring out the garlic and the crosses.

1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:22.040
 We don't want to have anything to do with it then.

1:23:22.040 --> 1:23:25.600
 And I think today there are many more people who've read her and might disagree or not

1:23:25.600 --> 1:23:26.600
 disagree.

1:23:26.600 --> 1:23:27.600
 Right.

1:23:27.600 --> 1:23:30.040
 And then there were a lot of people who haven't read her, but who are not opposed to it or

1:23:30.040 --> 1:23:32.160
 willing to have an, to engage.

1:23:32.160 --> 1:23:34.000
 So I think it's changing already.

1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:35.560
 And I think in 20 years it'll be completely different.

1:23:35.560 --> 1:23:38.920
 And just two more things that she does that I think it says that I think people find very,

1:23:38.920 --> 1:23:41.020
 very off putting given our culture.

1:23:41.020 --> 1:23:46.340
 One is she will, basically you could sit down with Rand and be like, your fear is not in

1:23:46.340 --> 1:23:48.680
 any way a hold on my freedom.

1:23:48.680 --> 1:23:50.000
 Just that one sentence.

1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:55.760
 And for a lot of people that's very off putting and very harsh, it's correct.

1:23:55.760 --> 1:23:59.040
 But for them, it's just like, wait a minute, I'm still scared.

1:23:59.040 --> 1:24:00.040
 It's like, I don't care.

1:24:00.040 --> 1:24:04.160
 Like for example, like with lockdowns and things like this, it's like, well, I'm scared

1:24:04.160 --> 1:24:05.760
 and maybe I have a right to be scared.

1:24:05.760 --> 1:24:08.340
 Or like, I'm scared that you have a gun in your house.

1:24:08.340 --> 1:24:10.520
 And it's like, I respect that you're scared.

1:24:10.520 --> 1:24:11.520
 I don't care.

1:24:11.520 --> 1:24:13.920
 At the end, as you say at the end of the day, this is my house.

1:24:13.920 --> 1:24:17.440
 I'm going to live my life as I please, as long as I don't hurt other people.

1:24:17.440 --> 1:24:19.160
 Well, you are hurting me because I'm scared.

1:24:19.160 --> 1:24:20.360
 No, that's not.

1:24:20.360 --> 1:24:21.920
 This is the feeling versus fact.

1:24:21.920 --> 1:24:22.920
 Yeah, yeah.

1:24:22.920 --> 1:24:23.920
 So that is one situation.

1:24:23.920 --> 1:24:26.200
 This is like a feeling versus freedom, essentially.

1:24:26.200 --> 1:24:30.680
 Yes, where Rand is, that puts a lot of people off.

1:24:30.680 --> 1:24:36.880
 I also think that historically, a lot of people who were drawn to her are drawn to her for

1:24:36.880 --> 1:24:38.520
 the wrong reasons.

1:24:38.520 --> 1:24:43.840
 That a lot of times, like Howard Rourke, the hero, we're gonna still say hero.

1:24:43.840 --> 1:24:45.520
 You're supposed to say protagonist, but hero.

1:24:45.520 --> 1:24:51.720
 The hero of the fountainhead, he's extremely intelligent, but he's also extremely uncompromising.

1:24:51.720 --> 1:24:55.960
 What often ends up happening is you'll have a young kid who is somewhat intelligent, but

1:24:55.960 --> 1:24:59.600
 then they pick up the personality and now you're someone I can't work with.

1:24:59.600 --> 1:25:01.740
 And then it's like, you're not Howard Rourke, relax.

1:25:01.740 --> 1:25:02.740
 You're not that skilled.

1:25:02.740 --> 1:25:03.740
 You're not that talented.

1:25:03.740 --> 1:25:08.880
 But because the character has to do personification and have certain aspects together, when kids

1:25:08.880 --> 1:25:10.560
 read that, they might get the wrong idea.

1:25:10.560 --> 1:25:11.560
 That's not Rand's fault.

1:25:11.560 --> 1:25:12.680
 And it's more than that.

1:25:12.680 --> 1:25:18.600
 It's so, I completely agree with that, but it's even broader than that.

1:25:18.600 --> 1:25:24.400
 So here is, in my view, one of the geniuses of the millennium presenting a philosophy.

1:25:24.400 --> 1:25:27.120
 And she's got not just the questions, in my view, she's got the answers.

1:25:27.120 --> 1:25:30.600
 And you're reading them at 16 and you're reading the answers.

1:25:30.600 --> 1:25:34.240
 You don't know at 16 that this is true.

1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:37.560
 You might have a sense that it's true, but you don't have the life experience, the learned

1:25:37.560 --> 1:25:38.560
 experience.

1:25:38.560 --> 1:25:40.360
 You don't have the facts, you don't have the knowledge.

1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:41.640
 You're picking up truth.

1:25:41.640 --> 1:25:43.400
 It's just being absorbed.

1:25:43.400 --> 1:25:46.180
 You're accepting it as true, but you don't know it's true.

1:25:46.180 --> 1:25:51.280
 And then you go out into the world advocating for it, which we all did, or at least I did,

1:25:51.280 --> 1:25:52.560
 when I was 16.

1:25:52.560 --> 1:25:54.020
 And you're obnoxious.

1:25:54.020 --> 1:25:58.040
 You can't prove what you're arguing for because you don't have the experience.

1:25:58.040 --> 1:26:03.780
 It took me, I don't know, 10, 20 years, probably 20, to figure out that I really do think what

1:26:03.780 --> 1:26:07.000
 she said was true, but I didn't know when I was 16.

1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:13.960
 When I was 16, I just absorbed these ideas and accepted them, in a sense, with some connection

1:26:13.960 --> 1:26:20.560
 to reality, but in a sense, on faith, at least presented it that way.

1:26:20.560 --> 1:26:26.280
 And as a consequence, you come off as a detached from reality, obnoxious human being.

1:26:26.280 --> 1:26:30.680
 And I think a lot of young objectivists are, and it's hard not to be, because you are.

1:26:30.680 --> 1:26:32.320
 You're confronted with genius.

1:26:32.320 --> 1:26:33.320
 And you're not a genius.

1:26:33.320 --> 1:26:34.640
 I certainly am not a genius.

1:26:34.640 --> 1:26:38.480
 And I'm confronted with just genius and have all this information in my head now.

1:26:38.480 --> 1:26:41.880
 I can't articulate it.

1:26:41.880 --> 1:26:42.880
 And it's hard to deal with yourself.

1:26:42.880 --> 1:26:43.880
 What?

1:26:43.880 --> 1:26:44.880
 There's an inside joke.

1:26:44.880 --> 1:26:45.880
 No, you said I'm confronted with genius.

1:26:45.880 --> 1:26:46.880
 I pointed to us.

1:26:46.880 --> 1:26:47.880
 Yes.

1:26:47.880 --> 1:26:48.880
 I mean, I'm confronted with you guys.

1:26:48.880 --> 1:26:52.160
 I'm at an age where I know how to deal with geniuses.

1:26:52.160 --> 1:26:53.600
 But there's something else.

1:26:53.600 --> 1:26:56.560
 This is not why people don't like her, but there's something that the Fountainhead does,

1:26:56.560 --> 1:27:01.940
 which I think is very, and I don't blame her, but it's a bad consequence.

1:27:01.940 --> 1:27:05.640
 If you read the Fountainhead and you're young and you're intelligent and talented, the message

1:27:05.640 --> 1:27:09.400
 at least I got, and I know I'm not alone, is you are going to think that you're going

1:27:09.400 --> 1:27:14.440
 to be a pariah, that a lot of people are going to be against you, and you're basically doomed

1:27:14.440 --> 1:27:17.960
 for a short period of being isolated and alone.

1:27:17.960 --> 1:27:20.640
 And that may have been the case when Fountainhead was written.

1:27:20.640 --> 1:27:24.480
 But I think now with the internet, and in my experience, both as a youth and someone

1:27:24.480 --> 1:27:28.280
 who's a little bit older, I didn't appreciate, and you're not going to get it from that book,

1:27:28.280 --> 1:27:31.540
 and you can't get it through that book because it has to have a certain narrative, how many

1:27:31.540 --> 1:27:38.800
 people who are a little older are giddy when they find young talent, how inspiring it is,

1:27:38.800 --> 1:27:39.800
 how exciting it is.

1:27:39.800 --> 1:27:43.240
 Like when you talk to these kids who are doing things on the internet or writing or whatever

1:27:43.240 --> 1:27:45.960
 achievement, you want them to flourish.

1:27:45.960 --> 1:27:50.260
 You're not threatened by them as the antagonists of the Fountainhead are, and that doesn't

1:27:50.260 --> 1:27:53.360
 come through in the Fountainhead because it depends on your profession, right?

1:27:53.360 --> 1:27:56.640
 I mean, some of these parts of the world are better than others.

1:27:56.640 --> 1:28:02.880
 If you're an artist, at least the way I conceive of art, and you want to go study art today,

1:28:02.880 --> 1:28:06.680
 you're going to be pouped and look down on and so on.

1:28:06.680 --> 1:28:07.680
 So yeah, I agree.

1:28:07.680 --> 1:28:13.500
 I mean, in my generation, when I read Iron Man, there was no internet, and I was in Israel,

1:28:13.500 --> 1:28:17.860
 so we were isolated, and there was nobody else who had shared their ideas, and you did

1:28:17.860 --> 1:28:19.960
 feel that kind of isolation.

1:28:19.960 --> 1:28:26.120
 But Roark gave you, to me, he didn't teach me about you're going to be isolated because

1:28:26.120 --> 1:28:36.480
 partially because I wasn't, maybe I was humble, right?

1:28:36.480 --> 1:28:40.480
 When I read Atlas Shrugged, I identified with Eddie Willis.

1:28:40.480 --> 1:28:43.960
 When I read the Fountainhead, I didn't identify with Howard Roark.

1:28:43.960 --> 1:28:46.200
 How old were you when you read the Fountainhead?

1:28:46.200 --> 1:28:47.480
 So I read Atlas when I was 16.

1:28:47.480 --> 1:28:52.000
 I probably read the Fountainhead when I was 16 and a half, 17, something like that.

1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:53.000
 That is unfathomable crime.

1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:55.280
 You read the Fountainhead after Atlas Shrugged?

1:28:55.280 --> 1:29:00.700
 If anyone listening to this, if you read the Fountainhead after Atlas Shrugged, that is

1:29:00.700 --> 1:29:01.700
 a war crime.

1:29:01.700 --> 1:29:05.440
 No, for me, reading Atlas Shrugged was much more important.

1:29:05.440 --> 1:29:10.240
 It is more important, but my point is, I think the Fountainhead in many ways is redundant

1:29:10.240 --> 1:29:13.920
 in certain aspects if you read Atlas Shrugged first, and because the Fountainhead is such

1:29:13.920 --> 1:29:17.440
 a masterful book and such a personal book.

1:29:17.440 --> 1:29:18.440
 I agree with that.

1:29:18.440 --> 1:29:19.440
 So ideally, you would read the Fountainhead.

1:29:19.440 --> 1:29:20.440
 That's what I'm saying, yes.

1:29:20.440 --> 1:29:24.020
 And here's the other thing people don't appreciate, I'm sorry to interrupt you.

1:29:24.020 --> 1:29:27.600
 People think Rand's always about politics, politics, politics, politics, but the Fountainhead

1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:29.000
 is not a political book at all.

1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:32.040
 It's about, well, she talks about politics in Mansoul, sure.

1:29:32.040 --> 1:29:36.200
 But it's about ethics, how important everyone has to have a moral code.

1:29:36.200 --> 1:29:38.460
 That's the other thing why people find Rand off putting.

1:29:38.460 --> 1:29:44.760
 If you have young people who now find it very important to live a moral life, who are like,

1:29:44.760 --> 1:29:50.400
 what does that mean to have morality, to have ethics, to live with integrity for people

1:29:50.400 --> 1:29:55.440
 who have gotten a little older, who have made these little sacrifices, who are like, I'm

1:29:55.440 --> 1:29:56.800
 not going to fight at work.

1:29:56.800 --> 1:29:58.560
 Do I really need to look for another job?

1:29:58.560 --> 1:30:02.800
 Yeah, my wife's kind of getting annoying, but am I going to make a fight about it?

1:30:02.800 --> 1:30:05.720
 These little sacrifices that they make every day.

1:30:05.720 --> 1:30:06.720
 And big ones.

1:30:06.720 --> 1:30:08.020
 And big ones, absolutely.

1:30:08.020 --> 1:30:14.840
 So when you have someone who's forcing you to look in the mirror and say, those little

1:30:14.840 --> 1:30:22.120
 sacrifices and big sacrifices you made, you did the wrong thing and you're evading that you betrayed your unconscious.

1:30:22.120 --> 1:30:24.480
 That to many people, I think, is very threatening.

1:30:24.480 --> 1:30:29.840
 But this is why so many people say that Ayn Rand is for 14 year old boys.

1:30:29.840 --> 1:30:30.840
 Yeah, right.

1:30:30.840 --> 1:30:31.840
 Right?

1:30:31.840 --> 1:30:32.840
 You grow out of it.

1:30:32.840 --> 1:30:37.680
 And there's a reason why it appeals to 14 as a little young, but 16, 18.

1:30:37.680 --> 1:30:41.320
 It's because those are the ages where we're still open to idealism.

1:30:41.320 --> 1:30:49.160
 In a positive sense, to beautiful things, to ideals, to seeking perfection, to seeking

1:30:49.160 --> 1:30:50.200
 a great life.

1:30:50.200 --> 1:30:53.080
 I think as you grow older, most people become cynical.

1:30:53.080 --> 1:30:54.080
 They give up on their ideals.

1:30:54.080 --> 1:30:55.080
 Why?

1:30:55.080 --> 1:30:57.480
 Because their ideals were wrong and their ideals failed.

1:30:57.480 --> 1:30:59.720
 My parents were socialists when they were young.

1:30:59.720 --> 1:31:00.720
 Those ideas failed.

1:31:00.720 --> 1:31:02.480
 So where do you go from socialism if your ideals fail?

1:31:02.480 --> 1:31:03.480
 Cynicism.

1:31:03.480 --> 1:31:04.480
 Yeah.

1:31:04.480 --> 1:31:05.480
 Which is horrible.

1:31:05.480 --> 1:31:08.060
 All adults, almost all adults out there are cynical.

1:31:08.060 --> 1:31:10.600
 And that is failed idealism.

1:31:10.600 --> 1:31:15.440
 When they look at the young people, they see their idealism, oh, well, I was idealistic

1:31:15.440 --> 1:31:16.440
 too.

1:31:16.440 --> 1:31:19.360
 And they don't question the idea, well, they're good ideals and they're bad ideals, they're

1:31:19.360 --> 1:31:22.320
 right ideals and they're wrong ideals.

1:31:22.320 --> 1:31:24.740
 And that's why they attribute it to youth.

1:31:24.740 --> 1:31:28.960
 So it's a threat to a lot of people, a lot of people who it's too late for.

1:31:28.960 --> 1:31:31.660
 For some people, it's too late to change their minds.

1:31:31.660 --> 1:31:33.520
 And they know it.

1:31:33.520 --> 1:31:38.840
 And they're too invested in the job, in the wife, in the compromises.

1:31:38.840 --> 1:31:39.840
 In the comfort.

1:31:39.840 --> 1:31:42.840
 And they're too invested in the comfort.

1:31:42.840 --> 1:31:45.400
 Too invested in a compromise, too invested in a comfort.

1:31:45.400 --> 1:31:47.480
 And they know that they shouldn't be.

1:31:47.480 --> 1:31:49.040
 They know they should change.

1:31:49.040 --> 1:31:51.120
 And these young people are challenging that.

1:31:51.120 --> 1:31:53.600
 And that is really, really scary for them.

1:31:53.600 --> 1:31:57.720
 And that's why they reject it without too much consideration.

1:31:57.720 --> 1:32:01.480
 One of the things Rand, the working title for Fountainhead was Secondhand Lives.

1:32:01.480 --> 1:32:04.480
 And Rand had two definitions of selfishness in that book.

1:32:04.480 --> 1:32:08.200
 One is selfishness in the sense of my life is the most important thing.

1:32:08.200 --> 1:32:09.760
 It's not the only important thing.

1:32:09.760 --> 1:32:11.520
 My family would be number two friends.

1:32:11.520 --> 1:32:15.480
 They certainly are extremely high values, but you can't have these secondary values

1:32:15.480 --> 1:32:16.480
 without the first value.

1:32:16.480 --> 1:32:17.760
 But in the context of my life, right?

1:32:17.760 --> 1:32:20.040
 Because your family might not be a value, right?

1:32:20.040 --> 1:32:21.040
 You might hate your parents.

1:32:21.040 --> 1:32:22.040
 Sure.

1:32:22.040 --> 1:32:23.520
 The point being selfishness.

1:32:23.520 --> 1:32:26.760
 Then there's the other kind of selfishness, which is Peter Keating, one of the villains

1:32:26.760 --> 1:32:30.400
 of the book, which is he's selfish in that he's greedy.

1:32:30.400 --> 1:32:33.040
 He's looking out for number one, but he has no values.

1:32:33.040 --> 1:32:34.380
 He has no sense of character.

1:32:34.380 --> 1:32:36.660
 He just wants to be wealthy.

1:32:36.660 --> 1:32:38.360
 He wants to have a beautiful wife.

1:32:38.360 --> 1:32:39.640
 He wants to have a big house.

1:32:39.640 --> 1:32:40.640
 Why?

1:32:40.640 --> 1:32:43.120
 He couldn't tell you because other people have it and he wants to have it more than

1:32:43.120 --> 1:32:44.120
 them.

1:32:44.120 --> 1:32:45.920
 His sense of reference is other people.

1:32:45.920 --> 1:32:47.560
 He's living secondhand.

1:32:47.560 --> 1:32:53.080
 The problem with that is a lot of young people read Rand and when they start arguing online,

1:32:53.080 --> 1:32:55.200
 they just start trying to talk like Rand.

1:32:55.200 --> 1:32:58.080
 Whereas Rand would be like, be original, be an innovator.

1:32:58.080 --> 1:33:02.640
 If you want to argue for objectivism in Rand's views, take her ideas, articulate them in

1:33:02.640 --> 1:33:03.640
 your own way.

1:33:03.640 --> 1:33:08.160
 That's a good way of showing that you understand what she thinks, but what they end up doing

1:33:08.160 --> 1:33:09.720
 is just talking like her.

1:33:09.720 --> 1:33:14.080
 It sounds dated and comical and that's going to be off putting because it's like Rand wouldn't

1:33:14.080 --> 1:33:16.400
 expect someone else to sound like Rand.

1:33:16.400 --> 1:33:18.480
 She's her own person.

1:33:18.480 --> 1:33:23.920
 She of course wouldn't view Keating as selfish in any sense because, or even greedy, greed

1:33:23.920 --> 1:33:24.920
 is a tricky word.

1:33:24.920 --> 1:33:27.240
 Well, he was selfish in the old school sense.

1:33:27.240 --> 1:33:33.400
 Yeah, he's selfish in the old, but even there, it's not as if he has some passion and he's

1:33:33.400 --> 1:33:39.080
 going after passion no matter what, I'm going to light, cheat, steal.

1:33:39.080 --> 1:33:42.320
 His passion is painting and he doesn't pursue his passion.

1:33:42.320 --> 1:33:48.520
 He pursues what his mother wants him to pursue and he pursues money and he's completely second

1:33:48.520 --> 1:33:51.680
 handed in the sense that he follows other people's values, not his own.

1:33:51.680 --> 1:33:56.160
 Can we actually just backtrack and can we define some of these ideas that Ayn Rand

1:33:56.160 --> 1:34:01.000
 is known for of selfishness, selfishness, egoism, egotism, greed?

1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:07.600
 Those all, basically all of those words are seen as negative in society and Ayn Rand has

1:34:07.600 --> 1:34:10.600
 been reclaiming in her work those words.

1:34:10.600 --> 1:34:13.200
 So can you speak to what they mean?

1:34:13.200 --> 1:34:20.280
 I think she's trying to, and Yaron might disagree, I think she's trying to be needlessly provocative

1:34:20.280 --> 1:34:25.000
 and it's off putting and on one hand, maybe you want to be a provocateur because that

1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:27.480
 gives you people like, what does this woman mean?

1:34:27.480 --> 1:34:30.800
 On the other hand, many people are going to be viscerally put off.

1:34:30.800 --> 1:34:37.120
 When Ayn Rand was on Donahue in 1979, he asked her explicitly, define to me the virtue of

1:34:37.120 --> 1:34:40.600
 selfishness, which is the title of her collection of essays as well.

1:34:40.600 --> 1:34:45.240
 And she, this is Rand, immediately says, use a different word, self esteem.

1:34:45.240 --> 1:34:49.880
 And it's like, yeah, it's like, why are you championing this word, which has extremely

1:34:49.880 --> 1:34:51.680
 negative connotations?

1:34:51.680 --> 1:34:58.540
 Whereas if you just say, and this is thanks to her and her work, my life matters, my values

1:34:58.540 --> 1:35:01.840
 matter, I'm not going to apologize for that.

1:35:01.840 --> 1:35:07.560
 That is a lot less off putting than this caricature of Rand, which is I'm for, when people hear

1:35:07.560 --> 1:35:11.200
 I'm for selfishness, they hear, oh, someone's bleeding out in the corner, but I want to

1:35:11.200 --> 1:35:12.200
 get a Coke.

1:35:12.200 --> 1:35:13.200
 That's nice.

1:35:13.200 --> 1:35:14.200
 She condemned that.

1:35:14.200 --> 1:35:15.880
 She says, I'm against this kind of sociopathy.

1:35:15.880 --> 1:35:17.160
 That's absolutely crazy.

1:35:17.160 --> 1:35:18.160
 But that word selfishness.

1:35:18.160 --> 1:35:24.640
 If it goes a mistake to be provocative in this one dimension, to go and to stick with

1:35:24.640 --> 1:35:25.640
 it.

1:35:25.640 --> 1:35:27.120
 I mean, she's stuck with this idea of selfishness and so on.

1:35:27.120 --> 1:35:31.840
 She's stuck with this term and it's, I often use terms for provocative effect.

1:35:31.840 --> 1:35:32.840
 Yes, this is true.

1:35:32.840 --> 1:35:36.200
 You're a master, you're a scholar of the trolling arts.

1:35:36.200 --> 1:35:37.200
 Thank you, sir.

1:35:37.200 --> 1:35:42.240
 But I think this is one example where the costs outweigh the benefits.

1:35:42.240 --> 1:35:43.240
 And go ahead, Yaron.

1:35:43.240 --> 1:35:48.200
 Yes, I'm open to that idea, but I don't think that's right.

1:35:48.200 --> 1:35:55.880
 When you actually dig deeper into what people object to, they're not objecting to the word.

1:35:55.880 --> 1:35:58.760
 They're objecting to the ideas.

1:35:58.760 --> 1:36:03.360
 And she addresses this explicitly in The Virtue of Selfishness in the, I think, the introduction.

1:36:03.360 --> 1:36:04.360
 Wait, hold on.

1:36:04.360 --> 1:36:05.640
 I got to ask for clarification.

1:36:05.640 --> 1:36:08.880
 You're saying they're objecting to the ideas, but when they talk about her, they're not

1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:09.880
 talking about her actual ideas.

1:36:09.880 --> 1:36:10.880
 They're talking about the caricature.

1:36:10.880 --> 1:36:11.880
 Well, sure.

1:36:11.880 --> 1:36:17.720
 But the caricature is a defense mechanism not to have to deal with the ideas, right?

1:36:17.720 --> 1:36:23.640
 So they create the caricature in order to ignore the ideas and some of them do it consciously.

1:36:23.640 --> 1:36:28.360
 Like when people like Krugman and others do this, they know exactly what they're doing.

1:36:28.360 --> 1:36:30.400
 But Krugman is Ellsworth Tewi.

1:36:30.400 --> 1:36:33.760
 Yes, he's the perfect Ellsworth Tewi.

1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:35.300
 And he knows Ayn Rand.

1:36:35.300 --> 1:36:36.840
 He's read Ayn Rand.

1:36:36.840 --> 1:36:38.800
 And he knows she's the enemy in some sense.

1:36:38.800 --> 1:36:39.800
 He knows...

1:36:39.800 --> 1:36:42.440
 Check out our episode with Krugman.

1:36:42.440 --> 1:36:43.440
 I think it's number 90.

1:36:43.440 --> 1:36:44.440
 It was a great conversation.

1:36:44.440 --> 1:36:46.960
 Didn't get as many views as me, but what are you going to do?

1:36:46.960 --> 1:36:50.800
 Well, he got a Nobel Prize, so what you got?

1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:52.320
 I've got a ticket to heaven.

1:36:52.320 --> 1:36:53.320
 Sorry, Paul.

1:36:53.320 --> 1:36:55.920
 Yasser Alford has a Nobel Prize.

1:36:55.920 --> 1:37:00.880
 And Hitler was a Times Man of the Year for a few times.

1:37:00.880 --> 1:37:02.480
 That really bothers me when people bring that up.

1:37:02.480 --> 1:37:03.480
 Are you really...

1:37:03.480 --> 1:37:04.480
 Yeah, Time of the Year...

1:37:04.480 --> 1:37:05.480
 It's called a joke, Michael.

1:37:05.480 --> 1:37:06.480
 It's not good.

1:37:06.480 --> 1:37:07.480
 Is it?

1:37:07.480 --> 1:37:09.120
 Man of the Year is not representative of good.

1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:13.000
 It represents the most influential person of that year, and Hitler was.

1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:14.840
 Wait, what were you upset about?

1:37:14.840 --> 1:37:16.640
 When people like, well, look at Time Magazine.

1:37:16.640 --> 1:37:17.800
 They called Hitler Man of the Year.

1:37:17.800 --> 1:37:18.800
 They were on set.

1:37:18.800 --> 1:37:19.800
 They were on set.

1:37:19.800 --> 1:37:20.800
 They were on set.

1:37:20.800 --> 1:37:21.800
 This guy's awesome.

1:37:21.800 --> 1:37:22.800
 They said this is the guy who moved the world the most.

1:37:22.800 --> 1:37:23.800
 It's not like he was Stalin.

1:37:23.800 --> 1:37:24.800
 I don't go out there.

1:37:24.800 --> 1:37:25.800
 Now, that's who they like.

1:37:25.800 --> 1:37:26.800
 Hitler's terrible.

1:37:26.800 --> 1:37:27.800
 The Stalin guy.

1:37:27.800 --> 1:37:28.800
 Oh, no, no.

1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:29.800
 I'm not even joking.

1:37:29.800 --> 1:37:39.880
 The attitude of people between Nazism and fascism and communism is stunning.

1:37:39.880 --> 1:37:43.700
 In my upcoming book, I have all the receipts how the things that they were saying about

1:37:43.700 --> 1:37:49.280
 Stalin at the time are, if you look back, it's unconscionable, and these people have

1:37:49.280 --> 1:37:51.680
 had no accountability in the positive direction.

1:37:51.680 --> 1:37:55.520
 That's not even at the time, and we need to get back to the selfishness stuff, but it's

1:37:55.520 --> 1:37:57.240
 not even at the time.

1:37:57.240 --> 1:37:59.880
 I think I've told this story.

1:37:59.880 --> 1:38:06.480
 I was in the green room going on John Stossel's show, and I saw a bunch of libertarians in

1:38:06.480 --> 1:38:10.720
 the green room all hanging out, and this guy walks in, this young guy walks in, and somebody

1:38:10.720 --> 1:38:13.320
 says to me, he's a communist.

1:38:13.320 --> 1:38:15.160
 I said, what do you mean?

1:38:15.160 --> 1:38:19.520
 They said, no, no, he's a card carrying member of the Communist Party.

1:38:19.520 --> 1:38:20.520
 He's a communist.

1:38:20.520 --> 1:38:23.480
 I said, and that's okay with you guys?

1:38:23.480 --> 1:38:26.640
 They go, yeah, yeah, he's a nice guy.

1:38:26.640 --> 1:38:28.680
 I'm like, no, this is not acceptable.

1:38:28.680 --> 1:38:29.680
 Hold on.

1:38:29.680 --> 1:38:30.680
 Let me quote Rand.

1:38:30.680 --> 1:38:34.640
 Rand said she would rather talk to a philosophical Marxist, right?

1:38:34.640 --> 1:38:35.640
 Did she not say this?

1:38:35.640 --> 1:38:41.200
 Yeah, but this is a communist in the context of 21st century, right?

1:38:41.200 --> 1:38:42.200
 So I said...

1:38:42.200 --> 1:38:43.200
 But not 20th.

1:38:43.200 --> 1:38:46.840
 Well, in the sense that we know exactly what, we know exactly.

1:38:46.840 --> 1:38:47.840
 Yeah, yeah, that's...

1:38:47.840 --> 1:38:50.840
 And this guy has the blood of 100 million people on his hands.

1:38:50.840 --> 1:38:52.480
 I'm not letting him off the hook.

1:38:52.480 --> 1:38:58.800
 So I engage with this guy, and literally we get into this... I'm telling him what I think

1:38:58.800 --> 1:39:03.800
 of his ideas, and therefore what I think of him, and the people from the wardrobe department

1:39:03.800 --> 1:39:07.560
 come out, and their chairs are put aside in this little gladiator ring.

1:39:07.560 --> 1:39:12.960
 It's like the libertarians are sitting there amused, because to them it's just... I'm

1:39:12.960 --> 1:39:17.240
 not going to name names, but to them it's just like, yeah, he's a communist, and I said

1:39:17.240 --> 1:39:23.840
 at some point to them... I won't name names, because... I said at some point to them,

1:39:23.840 --> 1:39:29.600
 if somebody walks into a room and says, I'm a Nazi, do you just treat him as, okay, let's

1:39:29.600 --> 1:39:30.600
 go hang out and get some drinks?

1:39:30.600 --> 1:39:31.600
 I do.

1:39:31.600 --> 1:39:32.600
 I don't.

1:39:32.600 --> 1:39:33.600
 I do.

1:39:33.600 --> 1:39:34.720
 Because I wrote a book about this, the new write, and I did talk to Nazis, and I went

1:39:34.720 --> 1:39:35.720
 to North Korea to talk to them.

1:39:35.720 --> 1:39:36.720
 Yeah, because you were writing a book.

1:39:36.720 --> 1:39:37.720
 Yeah.

1:39:37.720 --> 1:39:38.720
 Right?

1:39:38.720 --> 1:39:41.760
 But you're not going to hang out with a Nazi or a communist just like the regular person,

1:39:41.760 --> 1:39:42.760
 right?

1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:43.760
 To me, a Nazi and a communist are the same.

1:39:43.760 --> 1:39:47.160
 I don't under... Okay, please explain this, because first of all, any time you have a

1:39:47.160 --> 1:39:49.960
 lot of equivocation, I hate that, because I don't like equality.

1:39:49.960 --> 1:39:50.960
 I think it's a bad concept.

1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:51.960
 Sure.

1:39:51.960 --> 1:39:53.600
 We're all sitting here as Jewish people, right?

1:39:53.600 --> 1:39:56.240
 We're from the Soviet Union.

1:39:56.240 --> 1:39:59.600
 To say these two things are basically the same, it's a matter of life and death for

1:39:59.600 --> 1:40:00.600
 all of us.

1:40:00.600 --> 1:40:01.840
 We'd be dead under Hitler.

1:40:01.840 --> 1:40:04.200
 We're not doing so hot under Stalin, but we're still alive.

1:40:04.200 --> 1:40:05.200
 Sure.

1:40:05.200 --> 1:40:07.200
 There's some very big difference.

1:40:07.200 --> 1:40:08.200
 Sure.

1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:09.200
 One more thing.

1:40:09.200 --> 1:40:10.200
 So within the context, they're different, right?

1:40:10.200 --> 1:40:11.200
 Hold on, one more thing.

1:40:11.200 --> 1:40:15.080
 There's also one very big difference in that one has a lot worse of a brand name, and the

1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:17.320
 other does not, even though the other should.

1:40:17.320 --> 1:40:18.320
 It's a brand.

1:40:18.320 --> 1:40:19.320
 Yeah, yeah.

1:40:19.320 --> 1:40:20.320
 Yeah, so I agree.

1:40:20.320 --> 1:40:23.080
 So there's a context in which I would fear Stalin more than Hitler.

1:40:23.080 --> 1:40:29.560
 There's a different context in which I would fear Hitler, but as ideologies, they are equally

1:40:29.560 --> 1:40:30.560
 evil.

1:40:30.560 --> 1:40:31.560
 Wait, wait, but...

1:40:31.560 --> 1:40:36.140
 Not the same, because the difference is between communism and fascism, but as ideologies,

1:40:36.140 --> 1:40:37.140
 they're equally evil.

1:40:37.140 --> 1:40:41.160
 They both view the individual as insignificant, unimportant, and they both basically want

1:40:41.160 --> 1:40:42.640
 to kill any independent minded...

1:40:42.640 --> 1:40:45.640
 Well, you're equating communism with Stalinism, so you're equating...

1:40:45.640 --> 1:40:49.240
 No, I'm equating communism... I don't know what Stalinism is.

1:40:49.240 --> 1:40:50.240
 I don't care.

1:40:50.240 --> 1:40:53.840
 Stalinism is one version of communism, I'm sure there are others.

1:40:53.840 --> 1:40:57.240
 Communism is an evil ideology, no matter who practices it.

1:40:57.240 --> 1:41:02.720
 I don't think that's... I think that's too loose, because here's one example.

1:41:02.720 --> 1:41:10.000
 The first person who went to the Soviet Union from the left and denounced it was Emma Goldman.

1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:11.960
 She was an anarcho communist, right?

1:41:11.960 --> 1:41:14.520
 So she went there, she got deported from the United States.

1:41:14.520 --> 1:41:16.080
 She went to Lenin to his face.

1:41:16.080 --> 1:41:17.560
 Hold on, let me finish.

1:41:17.560 --> 1:41:19.520
 You're already dismissing what I'm saying.

1:41:19.520 --> 1:41:20.520
 Me?

1:41:20.520 --> 1:41:21.520
 No.

1:41:21.520 --> 1:41:22.520
 Your body language, your emotions.

1:41:22.520 --> 1:41:23.520
 No.

1:41:23.520 --> 1:41:24.520
 Humility, yeah.

1:41:24.520 --> 1:41:25.520
 Humility.

1:41:25.520 --> 1:41:26.520
 History doesn't carry your feelings either.

1:41:26.520 --> 1:41:29.720
 She goes to Lenin, she goes, we're supposed to be about free speech.

1:41:29.720 --> 1:41:31.440
 We're supposed to be about the individual freedom.

1:41:31.440 --> 1:41:32.440
 What are you doing?

1:41:32.440 --> 1:41:34.600
 And he goes, free speech is a bourgeois extravagance.

1:41:34.600 --> 1:41:37.180
 You can't have it during a revolution, too bad.

1:41:37.180 --> 1:41:38.680
 She comes back to the West.

1:41:38.680 --> 1:41:39.680
 Wait, he's right?

1:41:39.680 --> 1:41:40.680
 Yeah.

1:41:40.680 --> 1:41:41.680
 Oh no, yeah, of course.

1:41:41.680 --> 1:41:42.680
 She's more consistent with the idea.

1:41:42.680 --> 1:41:43.680
 Yeah, he's more consistent.

1:41:43.680 --> 1:41:44.680
 She's a compromise.

1:41:44.680 --> 1:41:45.680
 Yeah, you're right.

1:41:45.680 --> 1:41:50.760
 Well, she comes back to the West, the big red Emma, the big hero of the left.

1:41:50.760 --> 1:41:55.160
 And she goes, you guys, this is a complete, not, she didn't say bad.

1:41:55.160 --> 1:41:56.160
 She was very random.

1:41:56.160 --> 1:41:57.780
 She goes, this is pure evil.

1:41:57.780 --> 1:41:59.000
 This is horrifying.

1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:03.000
 What they're doing to the workers, which you supposedly care about, completely oppressing.

1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:08.000
 And when one person described, they go, when she got up to talk, it was a standing ovation.

1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:12.860
 And when she was finished, you could hear a pin drop because she wasn't some capitalist.

1:42:12.860 --> 1:42:15.760
 She wasn't some bourgeois conservative.

1:42:15.760 --> 1:42:19.360
 She was as hard left for violent revolution as it gets.

1:42:19.360 --> 1:42:22.880
 And so I don't think she, as a communist, is an evil person.

1:42:22.880 --> 1:42:24.520
 I think she is.

1:42:24.520 --> 1:42:32.240
 Because if she wasn't evading, and with Rand, and I think in reality, the essence of evil

1:42:32.240 --> 1:42:37.660
 is evasion, is ignoring the facts of reality, is putting your feelings ahead of your facts.

1:42:37.660 --> 1:42:42.360
 She would realize that what was going on in the Soviet Union was the inevitable consequence

1:42:42.360 --> 1:42:43.360
 of her ideas.

1:42:43.360 --> 1:42:44.360
 That could be just she's dumb.

1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:46.420
 So she could have changed her mind.

1:42:46.420 --> 1:42:50.240
 She could have, coming back to the Soviet Union, said, these ideas are wrong.

1:42:50.240 --> 1:42:54.880
 I now repudiate my ideas, not just of implementation, but my ideas.

1:42:54.880 --> 1:42:58.440
 And then I would have said, yeah, she had been mistaken before, and now she's confronted

1:42:58.440 --> 1:42:59.440
 reality.

1:42:59.440 --> 1:43:04.840
 But if she stayed a leftist, if she stayed a leftist to that extent, not just a mild leftist,

1:43:04.840 --> 1:43:07.480
 then I think she's dishonest and therefore immoral.

1:43:07.480 --> 1:43:08.480
 So –

1:43:08.480 --> 1:43:09.480
 But you're using three words identically.

1:43:09.480 --> 1:43:10.880
 You're saying dishonest, immoral, and evil.

1:43:10.880 --> 1:43:11.880
 And I'm –

1:43:11.880 --> 1:43:12.880
 Okay.

1:43:12.880 --> 1:43:15.960
 So evil is more – is an extreme form of immorality, right?

1:43:15.960 --> 1:43:16.960
 Sure.

1:43:16.960 --> 1:43:17.960
 Of course.

1:43:17.960 --> 1:43:18.960
 So okay.

1:43:18.960 --> 1:43:19.960
 So she's immoral.

1:43:19.960 --> 1:43:20.960
 The ideology she holds is still evil because the ideology –

1:43:20.960 --> 1:43:21.960
 Maybe she's delusional.

1:43:21.960 --> 1:43:22.960
 She might be delusional.

1:43:22.960 --> 1:43:23.960
 But delusional and evil are the same.

1:43:23.960 --> 1:43:24.960
 But she can be delusional.

1:43:24.960 --> 1:43:26.360
 She cannot be delusional.

1:43:26.360 --> 1:43:32.360
 See, I'm willing to accept a delusion before she's gone to the Soviet Union and seen it.

1:43:32.360 --> 1:43:36.880
 Once she's gone to see it, I don't think that excuse holds anymore.

1:43:36.880 --> 1:43:41.120
 I think now she's being confronted and she's lying to herself about the implications of

1:43:41.120 --> 1:43:42.120
 it.

1:43:42.120 --> 1:43:47.560
 Logically, it's inevitable that what happens in the Soviet Union has to happen in any communist

1:43:47.560 --> 1:43:48.560
 context.

1:43:48.560 --> 1:43:54.000
 So to play a little bit of a devil's advocate here, is it logically inevitable?

1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:58.440
 Is it – can you imagine that there is communist systems where the consequences we've seen

1:43:58.440 --> 1:44:02.520
 in the 20th century are not the consequences we get?

1:44:02.520 --> 1:44:07.760
 In future societies, under different conditions, under different – with the internet, different

1:44:07.760 --> 1:44:09.760
 communication schemes, different set of resources.

1:44:09.760 --> 1:44:11.760
 As long as human beings are what we are.

1:44:11.760 --> 1:44:15.840
 Now the Borg – you remember the Borg from Star Trek or whatever the series was?

1:44:15.840 --> 1:44:16.840
 Okay, nerd.

1:44:16.840 --> 1:44:17.840
 Yeah.

1:44:17.840 --> 1:44:18.840
 I mean –

1:44:18.840 --> 1:44:19.840
 Okay, okay.

1:44:19.840 --> 1:44:20.840
 No.

1:44:20.840 --> 1:44:21.840
 I'm a nerd.

1:44:21.840 --> 1:44:22.840
 Okay.

1:44:22.840 --> 1:44:23.840
 The Borg –

1:44:23.840 --> 1:44:25.280
 It's the highest of compliments.

1:44:25.280 --> 1:44:26.280
 The Borg –

1:44:26.280 --> 1:44:27.280
 In this household.

1:44:27.280 --> 1:44:28.280
 The Borg is the highest of lex.

1:44:28.280 --> 1:44:29.280
 Now we're talking.

1:44:29.280 --> 1:44:32.180
 The Borg is communist, right?

1:44:32.180 --> 1:44:34.360
 The Borg is a different species.

1:44:34.360 --> 1:44:35.560
 It has a different biology.

1:44:35.560 --> 1:44:38.800
 It has a business – different form of consciousness.

1:44:38.800 --> 1:44:43.280
 Now whether such a being could survive evolution is a question.

1:44:43.280 --> 1:44:44.280
 Whether such a –

1:44:44.280 --> 1:44:45.280
 People are ants.

1:44:45.280 --> 1:44:46.280
 They don't have to be intelligent.

1:44:46.280 --> 1:44:50.680
 Yeah, but then the question is can you have free will, human cognitive cognition and be

1:44:50.680 --> 1:44:51.680
 a Borg?

1:44:51.680 --> 1:44:52.680
 I don't think so.

1:44:52.680 --> 1:44:53.680
 But maybe.

1:44:53.680 --> 1:44:54.680
 Sure.

1:44:54.680 --> 1:44:55.680
 Maybe in another planet.

1:44:55.680 --> 1:44:56.680
 But human beings –

1:44:56.680 --> 1:44:57.680
 You've got to take DMT to meet the Borg.

1:44:57.680 --> 1:45:04.000
 So human beings – no, communism is anti – the reason communism is evil is it's

1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:09.520
 anti reality, anti human nature, anti the individual, and therefore it is inherently

1:45:09.520 --> 1:45:10.520
 evil.

1:45:10.520 --> 1:45:13.360
 It cannot result in anything good coming out of it.

1:45:13.360 --> 1:45:14.360
 Only bad can come of it.

1:45:14.360 --> 1:45:16.920
 Do you think you could have predicted that before the 20th century?

1:45:16.920 --> 1:45:18.320
 Yes, and plenty of people did.

1:45:18.320 --> 1:45:19.320
 It's not –

1:45:19.320 --> 1:45:20.320
 You know who did?

1:45:20.320 --> 1:45:21.320
 Mikhail Bakunin.

1:45:21.320 --> 1:45:25.800
 Mikhail Bakunin, who was an early communist Marxist rival in 18 – this is going to be

1:45:25.800 --> 1:45:31.160
 in my upcoming book – in 1860, he sat down and wrote an essay, he goes, what Marx is

1:45:31.160 --> 1:45:33.200
 advocating is insane.

1:45:33.200 --> 1:45:35.120
 This is going to be worse than the czar.

1:45:35.120 --> 1:45:38.140
 You're talking about complete totalitarian nightmare.

1:45:38.140 --> 1:45:41.600
 When you put this into practice, it's going to be something we've never seen before.

1:45:41.600 --> 1:45:42.600
 It's a pure horror.

1:45:42.600 --> 1:45:43.880
 Like, he was a hardcore leftist.

1:45:43.880 --> 1:45:45.360
 Look, Marx predicted it, right?

1:45:45.360 --> 1:45:46.360
 We talked about this.

1:45:46.360 --> 1:45:47.360
 Yeah, that's true too.

1:45:47.360 --> 1:45:48.360
 Yeah, yeah.

1:45:48.360 --> 1:45:50.840
 Marx at some point says certain people cannot be part of the proletariat and they have to

1:45:50.840 --> 1:45:51.920
 be liquidated.

1:45:51.920 --> 1:45:56.640
 So this idea of mass murder and mass killing is not new to communism, it is an inherent

1:45:56.640 --> 1:45:58.240
 part of what it means.

1:45:58.240 --> 1:46:00.840
 You're either proletarian or you're not.

1:46:00.840 --> 1:46:04.260
 And you're – look, and in Marx, it's in Marx, right?

1:46:04.260 --> 1:46:06.280
 The individual doesn't matter.

1:46:06.280 --> 1:46:09.760
 Now he might matter in his utopia because he knows he's got a marketing problem.

1:46:09.760 --> 1:46:13.560
 See, Marx has a marketing problem because of the fact that you have individuals.

1:46:13.560 --> 1:46:17.720
 How do you convince individuals to give up their individualism, to give up the individuality?

1:46:17.720 --> 1:46:20.640
 What you say is, well, we have to go through this difficult process.

1:46:20.640 --> 1:46:21.640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:46:21.640 --> 1:46:22.680
 We have to get to this utopia.

1:46:22.680 --> 1:46:25.960
 And in this utopia, I mean, he's very Christian.

1:46:25.960 --> 1:46:27.360
 I mean, this is the other thing about Marx.

1:46:27.360 --> 1:46:28.360
 About the end time.

1:46:28.360 --> 1:46:32.240
 Marx is very Christian in everything, in his morality, in his collectivism, and in the

1:46:32.240 --> 1:46:33.240
 end time.

1:46:33.240 --> 1:46:36.480
 The end times for Marx is going back to the Garden of Eden.

1:46:36.480 --> 1:46:40.840
 The end time for Marx is you don't have to do anything.

1:46:40.840 --> 1:46:43.040
 Food is just available.

1:46:43.040 --> 1:46:44.560
 Wealth is just available.

1:46:44.560 --> 1:46:46.280
 You can do your hobbies.

1:46:46.280 --> 1:46:47.280
 You can do everything.

1:46:47.280 --> 1:46:49.280
 You can do whatever you want, whatever feelings, whatever.

1:46:49.280 --> 1:46:53.400
 So it's going back to a Garden of Eden perspective on human.

1:46:53.400 --> 1:46:55.400
 So he knows what that is going to require.

1:46:55.400 --> 1:46:58.520
 It's going to require this dictatorship of the proletarian to get there.

1:46:58.520 --> 1:47:00.680
 And he never tells you how we get there.

1:47:00.680 --> 1:47:01.680
 There's no game plan.

1:47:01.680 --> 1:47:05.000
 There's a dictatorship, then there's utopia.

1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:06.000
 It's like the underpants.

1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:07.000
 Step one, dictatorship.

1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:08.000
 Step two, question mark.

1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:09.000
 Step three, utopia.

1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:10.000
 Yeah.

1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:11.560
 And the question mark is where the action is, right?

1:47:11.560 --> 1:47:12.560
 Annihilate.

1:47:12.560 --> 1:47:15.320
 Yeah, you yada yada the important part.

1:47:15.320 --> 1:47:17.520
 And people buy this garbage, right?

1:47:17.520 --> 1:47:20.720
 So there's nothing of value in Marx.

1:47:20.720 --> 1:47:22.040
 I mean, let me be very clear.

1:47:22.040 --> 1:47:23.040
 There's nothing.

1:47:23.040 --> 1:47:24.740
 He gets capitalism wrong.

1:47:24.740 --> 1:47:26.560
 He gets the proletarian wrong.

1:47:26.560 --> 1:47:27.780
 He gets the workers wrong.

1:47:27.780 --> 1:47:31.560
 He gets the labor theory of value is wrong.

1:47:31.560 --> 1:47:33.320
 There is nothing of value.

1:47:33.320 --> 1:47:35.200
 There's nothing of value in communism.

1:47:35.200 --> 1:47:41.200
 It is a wrong, unfitted to human nature ideology from beginning to end.

1:47:41.200 --> 1:47:45.380
 The clarity with which you speak is just not something I, I don't think I have that clarity

1:47:45.380 --> 1:47:46.380
 about anything.

1:47:46.380 --> 1:47:50.200
 But I mean, it has to do with that thing that where everybody has something to teach you.

1:47:50.200 --> 1:47:54.760
 I just feel like I've been reading Mein Kampf recently, for example, for the first time.

1:47:54.760 --> 1:47:55.760
 Something to learn from Hitler?

1:47:55.760 --> 1:47:57.860
 Well, there's a lot to learn from Hitler.

1:47:57.860 --> 1:48:01.760
 About the nature of evil, about wrong ideas, not about anything good, not about anything

1:48:01.760 --> 1:48:02.760
 positive.

1:48:02.760 --> 1:48:03.760
 Oh, so yeah.

1:48:03.760 --> 1:48:05.280
 So that's probably a really bad example.

1:48:05.280 --> 1:48:07.720
 Why is Hitler different than Marx?

1:48:07.720 --> 1:48:08.720
 That's a very good question.

1:48:08.720 --> 1:48:09.720
 No, I get that.

1:48:09.720 --> 1:48:11.640
 But in terms of ideas, why is Hitler different than Marx?

1:48:11.640 --> 1:48:16.360
 Why do we have to assume there's something to learn from Marx, but there's nothing, but

1:48:16.360 --> 1:48:19.480
 we acknowledge that there's nothing positive to learn from Hitler.

1:48:19.480 --> 1:48:20.480
 Because I mean, all right.

1:48:20.480 --> 1:48:23.960
 I can tell you something, in the sense that like, there's an interesting question is,

1:48:23.960 --> 1:48:28.160
 how did this person get from step A to being able to implement the ideas?

1:48:28.160 --> 1:48:32.680
 I know, everybody should read, anybody who's interested should read Marx, because it's

1:48:32.680 --> 1:48:33.680
 really important.

1:48:33.680 --> 1:48:36.460
 It's important in the history and a lot of people were influenced by it.

1:48:36.460 --> 1:48:37.660
 Why was it influential?

1:48:37.660 --> 1:48:40.320
 What is it that he says that appeals to people?

1:48:40.320 --> 1:48:42.880
 I find it interesting to see all the parallels with Christianity.

1:48:42.880 --> 1:48:46.960
 I think that's why to a large extent it appeals to people because they got to give up the

1:48:46.960 --> 1:48:51.520
 unimportant part of religion and got to keep the fun parts of religion, the important parts

1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:54.440
 to them of religion, the morality, for example.

1:48:54.440 --> 1:48:58.720
 But no, there's not something positive to learn from everybody.

1:48:58.720 --> 1:49:04.440
 In Ayn Rand's view, in your view, who was worse, Stalin or Hitler?

1:49:04.440 --> 1:49:12.600
 I think worse is, this is something that I'll do a Randian sin and be evasive.

1:49:12.600 --> 1:49:18.880
 It really drives me crazy when people sit down and have these competitions about like,

1:49:18.880 --> 1:49:21.960
 if someone who's Jewish brings up the Holocaust and someone who's African American brings

1:49:21.960 --> 1:49:27.280
 up slavery, and this is a conversation that I think is pointless and very hurtful and

1:49:27.280 --> 1:49:31.280
 harmful and it is really silly and ridiculous.

1:49:31.280 --> 1:49:35.040
 So it might make sense in some kind of stoner context about like you're doing the math and

1:49:35.040 --> 1:49:39.100
 trying to figure out, but it's like, and yeah, you could be like, what would you rather have

1:49:39.100 --> 1:49:41.360
 like this kind of cancer or full blown AIDS?

1:49:41.360 --> 1:49:48.200
 In short, I mean, there's gotta be life expectancy, but these are such, I'll evade your question,

1:49:48.200 --> 1:49:49.280
 reframe it.

1:49:49.280 --> 1:49:54.960
 I think we understand, and a lot of this is a function of the propaganda at the time,

1:49:54.960 --> 1:49:58.800
 and I'm not using the word propaganda in a negative sense, the horrors of Hitler and

1:49:58.800 --> 1:50:00.160
 Nazism.

1:50:00.160 --> 1:50:04.480
 I think, and one of the things I'm trying to solve with my upcoming book, there is a

1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:11.720
 very poor understanding about the horrors of Stalinism and what that meant in practice.

1:50:11.720 --> 1:50:16.620
 One of the reasons I wrote Dear Reader, my North Korea book, and what I was shocked and

1:50:16.620 --> 1:50:22.440
 delighted by when I started writing Dear Reader, I thought to myself, look, I have very little

1:50:22.440 --> 1:50:26.560
 capacity to affect change, but I can tell stories.

1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:27.560
 I can write books.

1:50:27.560 --> 1:50:29.400
 This is my competency.

1:50:29.400 --> 1:50:33.080
 If I move the needle in America, we got it pretty good here.

1:50:33.080 --> 1:50:37.880
 If I move the needle in North Korea, this could have really profound positive consequences.

1:50:37.880 --> 1:50:43.120
 I set a very limited goal, and that goal is to change the conversation about North Korea,

1:50:43.120 --> 1:50:51.120
 to stop it being regarded as a laughing stock and start regarding it as an existential horror.

1:50:51.120 --> 1:50:54.880
 The metaphor I use always, and we brought up earlier, was the Joker, because people

1:50:54.880 --> 1:50:59.160
 look at Kim Jong Un, Kim Jong Il, his father, they look at a clown disguised as a buffoon,

1:50:59.160 --> 1:51:02.900
 and that's valid, and I said, this is what I can do.

1:51:02.900 --> 1:51:06.960
 I can move that camera a little bit, and now that camera, instead of looking at Kim Jong

1:51:06.960 --> 1:51:12.900
 Un, Kim Jong Il, you see behind him literally millions of corpses, and when you see people

1:51:12.900 --> 1:51:17.360
 putting on these performances in these shows, look at these fools, then you're like, everyone

1:51:17.360 --> 1:51:20.760
 those people, their kid has a gun to their head right now.

1:51:20.760 --> 1:51:23.400
 If someone puts a gun to your kid's head, you're going to put on clown makeup?

1:51:23.400 --> 1:51:24.460
 Yeah, you are.

1:51:24.460 --> 1:51:25.460
 What color?

1:51:25.460 --> 1:51:27.640
 Put on the shoes, whatever you want.

1:51:27.640 --> 1:51:34.680
 So in terms of, people do not appreciate the horrors of Stalinism.

1:51:34.680 --> 1:51:37.400
 I think this is a big fault of the right wing.

1:51:37.400 --> 1:51:40.680
 You can't expect necessarily the New York Times to do this because of the blood on their

1:51:40.680 --> 1:51:45.920
 hands, and for a long time, I was berating conservatives, I go, this was the big right

1:51:45.920 --> 1:51:49.880
 wing victory, bloodless largely, the victory of the Soviet Union.

1:51:49.880 --> 1:51:54.760
 No one's talking about it, no one's informing, and let's be clear, there are very many people

1:51:54.760 --> 1:51:58.420
 who are Democrats who are on the left, who are violently opposed, literally violently

1:51:58.420 --> 1:52:03.720
 opposed to the Soviet Union, it's horrors, this is not necessarily a partisan issue.

1:52:03.720 --> 1:52:05.680
 And I'm like, all right, I'm going to do something about it.

1:52:05.680 --> 1:52:10.520
 So I know that's not really literally your question, but you know, that's kind of information

1:52:10.520 --> 1:52:11.520
 that feeds us.

1:52:11.520 --> 1:52:13.560
 Let me ask you that question if it's okay.

1:52:13.560 --> 1:52:20.880
 So what, which do we, can we learn more from, from a historical perspective looking forward?

1:52:20.880 --> 1:52:27.920
 From like, which has more lessons in, in how to avoid it, how to, and just general lessons

1:52:27.920 --> 1:52:28.920
 about human nature.

1:52:28.920 --> 1:52:34.360
 Well, I mean, I agree with Michael that it's not important who's more evil because they're

1:52:34.360 --> 1:52:39.880
 both evil and they're both just so evil that the differences don't matter.

1:52:39.880 --> 1:52:44.560
 What matters is what is the ideology?

1:52:44.560 --> 1:52:47.640
 What is the, what is, what are the consequences?

1:52:47.640 --> 1:52:49.200
 What do we understand from it?

1:52:49.200 --> 1:52:51.000
 What are we worried about?

1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:52.520
 What are we going to avoid?

1:52:52.520 --> 1:52:57.440
 So I'm not worried about Nazism qua Nazism because everybody hates Nazism.

1:52:57.440 --> 1:53:01.320
 I mean, it's uniform that that's out.

1:53:01.320 --> 1:53:06.340
 Even the people I think on the far right in America are staying away from the cliches

1:53:06.340 --> 1:53:08.600
 of Nazism, although some of them are stupid enough not to.

1:53:08.600 --> 1:53:13.600
 But, but in the end, if, if, if the United States goes authoritarian right, it's not

1:53:13.600 --> 1:53:14.600
 going to be Nazism.

1:53:14.600 --> 1:53:21.840
 It'd be some other form of fascism because that is so obviously, you know, being understood

1:53:21.840 --> 1:53:28.160
 as evil and bad that there's almost no understanding that the evil of communism, I mean, you brought

1:53:28.160 --> 1:53:30.840
 it up earlier, right?

1:53:30.840 --> 1:53:34.840
 Almost nobody understands that communism is an evil ideology, that there's, that there's

1:53:34.840 --> 1:53:41.260
 nothing worthwhile there, that any, any attempt to go in that direction in any sustainable

1:53:41.260 --> 1:53:42.960
 way is destructive.

1:53:42.960 --> 1:53:46.480
 They are, as you mentioned, they're economists out there claiming they are communists.

1:53:46.480 --> 1:53:51.960
 I mean, I find that despicable that anybody would claim to be a communist economist or

1:53:51.960 --> 1:53:57.680
 communist anything, because I think that's, it's a, it's a, it's a ideology that has

1:53:57.680 --> 1:54:00.120
 no basis, but we haven't learned that.

1:54:00.120 --> 1:54:06.280
 So to me, communism is the much bigger threat because we still think it's some kind of beautiful

1:54:06.280 --> 1:54:11.000
 ideal in, in the world around us.

1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:14.960
 I think Nazism is out, but I think, I think fascism is a, is a massive threat out there

1:54:14.960 --> 1:54:19.920
 because I don't think we've learned real lessons of, nobody knows what fascism is.

1:54:19.920 --> 1:54:21.440
 Everybody thinks fascism is Nazism.

1:54:21.440 --> 1:54:25.480
 They don't, they don't recognize that in a sense we are already fascist and that we're

1:54:25.480 --> 1:54:27.400
 certainly heading in that direction.

1:54:27.400 --> 1:54:28.440
 So they don't know what it is.

1:54:28.440 --> 1:54:33.040
 And again, we haven't studied, and the real lesson here is we haven't studied what unifies

1:54:33.040 --> 1:54:37.240
 them both because there's not a big difference between fascism and communism.

1:54:37.240 --> 1:54:39.000
 There's no big difference between Nazism and communism.

1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:40.440
 What does unify them?

1:54:40.440 --> 1:54:45.440
 What unifies them is the common good, the public interest.

1:54:45.440 --> 1:54:50.280
 What unifies them is this idea that there is some elite group of people who can run

1:54:50.280 --> 1:54:54.480
 our lives for us, for the common good, for the public interest.

1:54:54.480 --> 1:54:55.480
 And that you don't matter.

1:54:55.480 --> 1:55:01.400
 You as an individual, you individual don't matter and they, they will dictate how you

1:55:01.400 --> 1:55:02.400
 live.

1:55:02.400 --> 1:55:03.400
 And you know, so these are philosopher kings.

1:55:03.400 --> 1:55:07.160
 It goes back to Plato's philosophy, but it really unifies it.

1:55:07.160 --> 1:55:11.720
 Think about communism, communism is about the sacrifice of the individual to the proletarian.

1:55:11.720 --> 1:55:13.200
 Who is the proletarian?

1:55:13.200 --> 1:55:15.600
 It's this collective group here.

1:55:15.600 --> 1:55:17.440
 Who represents a proletarian?

1:55:17.440 --> 1:55:20.360
 Well they have, somebody has to, somebody has to tell the proletarian what they believe

1:55:20.360 --> 1:55:23.600
 in because they don't know, because there is no collective consciousness.

1:55:23.600 --> 1:55:27.760
 So you need a Stalin and this is the point about Marxism.

1:55:27.760 --> 1:55:36.120
 Marxism needs a dictator because somebody has to represent the values, the public interest,

1:55:36.120 --> 1:55:38.160
 what's good for the public.

1:55:38.160 --> 1:55:39.200
 Nazism needs the same thing.

1:55:39.200 --> 1:55:43.400
 Just Nazism replace proletarian with Aryans, the Aryan race.

1:55:43.400 --> 1:55:44.620
 And you have exactly the same thing.

1:55:44.620 --> 1:55:48.360
 You need a dictator to tell us what's good for the Aryan people so we can do what's good

1:55:48.360 --> 1:55:49.360
 for the Aryan people.

1:55:49.360 --> 1:55:53.840
 So it's impossible to have a communist system or a fascist system without a dictator naturally

1:55:53.840 --> 1:55:54.840
 emerging.

1:55:54.840 --> 1:55:56.400
 It's not, it's not possible to have a George.

1:55:56.400 --> 1:55:57.720
 It's not naturally, it's ideologically.

1:55:57.720 --> 1:56:00.400
 It's absolutely impossible to have that on scale.

1:56:00.400 --> 1:56:04.520
 You can certainly have communes where people behave communistically.

1:56:04.520 --> 1:56:06.200
 Because it's not inside the ideology.

1:56:06.200 --> 1:56:07.200
 Hold on.

1:56:07.200 --> 1:56:11.120
 Let me talk about fascism because fascism definitionally is going to have a strong man.

1:56:11.120 --> 1:56:14.240
 I don't even know how it could be fascism without that.

1:56:14.240 --> 1:56:18.720
 And let's talk, what you said earlier on is about how people don't know what fascism is.

1:56:18.720 --> 1:56:20.300
 Fascists don't know what fascism is.

1:56:20.300 --> 1:56:25.320
 So there's a superb book by John Diggins from the early seventies called Mussolini and Fascism,

1:56:25.320 --> 1:56:26.580
 the view from America.

1:56:26.580 --> 1:56:31.120
 So I find Mussolini to be a far more interesting figure than Hitler because he had a much more

1:56:31.120 --> 1:56:32.440
 nuanced career.

1:56:32.440 --> 1:56:34.160
 He was much more of an innovator.

1:56:34.160 --> 1:56:35.160
 He was an intellectual.

1:56:35.160 --> 1:56:39.100
 Which is shocking because he always comes across as a buffoon, but he was actually a

1:56:39.100 --> 1:56:40.100
 thinker.

1:56:40.100 --> 1:56:43.720
 Why did he not resist Hitler at all?

1:56:43.720 --> 1:56:51.000
 So one of the things with fascism is it comes, it's a direct line from Kant to Mussolini.

1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:56.600
 So basically there is a philosopher who I adore, who I'm sure you don't, called Schopenhauer.

1:56:56.600 --> 1:57:02.920
 And Schopenhauer, the question became, Rand was not a particularly humorous person.

1:57:02.920 --> 1:57:04.480
 She had some moments of wit.

1:57:04.480 --> 1:57:09.420
 There's a great moment when she was on Tom Snyder show in 1980, I believe, and she's

1:57:09.420 --> 1:57:14.720
 talking about Kant and she goes, Immanuel Kant and all his illegitimate children, if

1:57:14.720 --> 1:57:17.480
 you catch my meaning, she mean all his bastards.

1:57:17.480 --> 1:57:19.440
 But the host Tom Snyder did not pick up on it.

1:57:19.440 --> 1:57:21.560
 If you watch it on YouTube, you could pick up on it.

1:57:21.560 --> 1:57:26.520
 And what happened was once Kant bifurcated reality into the phenomenal world, the pure

1:57:26.520 --> 1:57:32.540
 idea world and the numeral world, the question became, well, what is the nature of this world

1:57:32.540 --> 1:57:33.640
 of ideas?

1:57:33.640 --> 1:57:35.240
 And Hegel had it meant reason.

1:57:35.240 --> 1:57:39.840
 I don't know even know what that means theoretically, that the world of reason is idea and this

1:57:39.840 --> 1:57:45.680
 is Schopenhauer who hated Hegel, who constantly attacked him by name and Hegel's followers

1:57:45.680 --> 1:57:46.880
 in his work.

1:57:46.880 --> 1:57:52.160
 He was a very big innovator in a malevolent way because he said the nature of reality,

1:57:52.160 --> 1:57:58.520
 this idea is will, meaning the universe doesn't care about you and it's constantly in this

1:57:58.520 --> 1:58:02.720
 reality putting urges in your mind, values.

1:58:02.720 --> 1:58:06.520
 And when you denounce these values and urges, that's the basis of morality.

1:58:06.520 --> 1:58:12.960
 And from there it went to Nietzsche and the will isn't mindless, it is a will to power.

1:58:12.960 --> 1:58:19.480
 Mussolini took this and basically said, because the will to power is the real reality, the

1:58:19.480 --> 1:58:23.320
 Kantian idea, therefore all of this is secondary.

1:58:23.320 --> 1:58:26.880
 So if we will it, we can make it happen.

1:58:26.880 --> 1:58:32.920
 When you have this concept of my willpower is stronger than reality and you're like,

1:58:32.920 --> 1:58:34.880
 okay, how's this program going to work?

1:58:34.880 --> 1:58:36.480
 We can make it happen.

1:58:36.480 --> 1:58:42.320
 That was why fascism is not a very coherent ideology because explicitly, there's a book

1:58:42.320 --> 1:58:46.520
 called from 1936 called The Philosophy of Fascism, which tried to codify this, 36, this

1:58:46.520 --> 1:58:53.020
 is a long time ago, where they're like, we're against reason and explicitly rationality.

1:58:53.020 --> 1:58:59.080
 We are for willpower, for strength, and if you are strong enough and united enough, you

1:58:59.080 --> 1:59:02.400
 can force these things to work.

1:59:02.400 --> 1:59:06.840
 So there's a lot that is not taught about this ideology.

1:59:06.840 --> 1:59:10.200
 I highly recommend people read the books from the time.

1:59:10.200 --> 1:59:15.160
 And what was fascinating about Mussolini is he was regarded as the moderate.

1:59:15.160 --> 1:59:21.040
 Because the 1930s, you had the Great Depression, all the intellectuals said, this proves capitalism

1:59:21.040 --> 1:59:25.640
 can't work, the Great Depression, obviously, air quotes, is capitalism's fault.

1:59:25.640 --> 1:59:27.400
 Then you have the alternative, the USSR.

1:59:27.400 --> 1:59:29.480
 Well, that's not tenable for us.

1:59:29.480 --> 1:59:34.040
 Here comes Mussolini and Mussolini says, I'm going to take the best of both worlds.

1:59:34.040 --> 1:59:38.720
 I have aspects of markets, capitalism, but I don't have this chaos, but I also don't

1:59:38.720 --> 1:59:41.640
 have complete government control of the bureaucrats.

1:59:41.640 --> 1:59:43.920
 I'm going to have this combination.

1:59:43.920 --> 1:59:47.360
 And there was a Broadway song, You're the Top, you're Mussolini.

1:59:47.360 --> 1:59:50.720
 That was later edited out because that's when he took a bad turn.

1:59:50.720 --> 1:59:54.600
 But this is kind of the fascist idea.

1:59:54.600 --> 1:59:57.440
 And it's about power and it's about control.

1:59:57.440 --> 1:59:58.440
 That's the essence.

1:59:58.440 --> 1:59:59.440
 It's about will.

1:59:59.440 --> 2:00:01.560
 So they don't care.

2:00:01.560 --> 2:00:07.040
 Fascists don't care who owns stuff, owns in quotes, because what's important is who controls

2:00:07.040 --> 2:00:08.040
 it.

2:00:08.040 --> 2:00:11.760
 So you can own your home, but if I get to tell you when you can sell it, for how much

2:00:11.760 --> 2:00:15.880
 you can sell it and what you can do on that home, then I'm in control of it.

2:00:15.880 --> 2:00:17.280
 That's the essence of fascism.

2:00:17.280 --> 2:00:22.400
 And if you think about it, we live today in a much more fascist economic context than

2:00:22.400 --> 2:00:24.760
 anything else.

2:00:24.760 --> 2:00:29.400
 We pretend that corporations are private, but when everything they do is regulated,

2:00:29.400 --> 2:00:34.960
 who they can hire, how much they pay them, when and how they can fire them, what they

2:00:34.960 --> 2:00:38.800
 can do in their property, it's all control.

2:00:38.800 --> 2:00:43.280
 That's the way fascists start controlling everything.

2:00:43.280 --> 2:00:47.320
 But it's not possible to have checks on power and balance of power at the top of fascism

2:00:47.320 --> 2:00:48.740
 or communist systems.

2:00:48.740 --> 2:00:56.400
 The question was whether in fascist systems or communist systems, we're saying the dictator

2:00:56.400 --> 2:00:58.200
 naturally or must emerge.

2:00:58.200 --> 2:01:02.200
 I don't say emerge, the dictator is the one who makes the fascist system.

2:01:02.200 --> 2:01:08.900
 Yeah, fascism, well, it could emerge because for example, I think today in America we're

2:01:08.900 --> 2:01:14.240
 moving much more towards fascism or socialism, and at some point that'll manifest itself

2:01:14.240 --> 2:01:15.760
 in some kind of dictator.

2:01:15.760 --> 2:01:19.280
 And the dictator might be different than a Mussolini or Nazis, it might be couched in

2:01:19.280 --> 2:01:23.280
 some kind of pseudo constitutional American presence.

2:01:23.280 --> 2:01:28.320
 It would be a lot easier for a female to be a fascist dictator in America than a male,

2:01:28.320 --> 2:01:29.760
 because do you have that softness?

2:01:29.760 --> 2:01:33.340
 She's not gonna come off as a strong woman, people won't see it coming, in my opinion.

2:01:33.340 --> 2:01:41.120
 I think it's gonna be a nationalist, religionist, environmentalist, I think somebody who can

2:01:41.120 --> 2:01:42.120
 combine those three.

2:01:42.120 --> 2:01:43.120
 Well, Hitler did those, yeah.

2:01:43.120 --> 2:01:44.120
 Yeah, exactly.

2:01:44.120 --> 2:01:47.040
 And somebody who can combine those three and articulate the case for it, I think America

2:01:47.040 --> 2:01:48.040
 is ready for it.

2:01:48.040 --> 2:01:50.760
 So you think it's possible for fascism to arise in the world again?

2:01:50.760 --> 2:01:54.920
 Oh, of course, it had never went away, they just adopt the name.

2:01:54.920 --> 2:02:00.480
 Because the fundamental ideas, the Kantian ideas, the ideas that are behind fascism never

2:02:00.480 --> 2:02:01.480
 went away.

2:02:01.480 --> 2:02:05.560
 They're still as popular, if anything, more popular than they were back then, Marx is

2:02:05.560 --> 2:02:06.560
 as popular.

2:02:06.560 --> 2:02:12.040
 I think these ideas are prevalent, they're out there, and absolutely, I think America

2:02:12.040 --> 2:02:13.040
 is ready for them.

2:02:13.040 --> 2:02:17.800
 Again, it won't be quite in the form that we've experienced in the past, it'll be in

2:02:17.800 --> 2:02:22.800
 a uniquely American form, couched at a flag, and of course, it was couched at a flag before.

2:02:22.800 --> 2:02:28.920
 But no, yes, an authoritarian, some form of authoritarianism is necessary, because the

2:02:28.920 --> 2:02:35.800
 fundamental principle behind both communism and fascism is the unimportance of the individual.

2:02:35.800 --> 2:02:42.320
 The individual is nothing, the individual is a nobody, and the importance of the collective.

2:02:42.320 --> 2:02:46.560
 The collective will, the collective soul, the collective consciousness, but the collective

2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:49.320
 has no will, has no soul, has no consciousness.

2:02:49.320 --> 2:02:55.720
 So somebody has to emerge to speak for the collective, otherwise, everything falls apart.

2:02:55.720 --> 2:03:01.600
 So it's necessary, whether it's a committee or whether it's one person, how exactly, somebody

2:03:01.600 --> 2:03:03.960
 has to speak for the collective.

2:03:03.960 --> 2:03:06.820
 Even a committee doesn't function as a committee, right?

2:03:06.820 --> 2:03:11.500
 Most committees, particularly when the committee is about dictating how people should live,

2:03:11.500 --> 2:03:14.560
 somebody is going to, because now it becomes really, really important, somebody is going

2:03:14.560 --> 2:03:18.880
 to dominate that committee and rule over it, because you don't want independent sources,

2:03:18.880 --> 2:03:22.320
 independent voices, because the individual doesn't matter, the individual doesn't count.

2:03:22.320 --> 2:03:26.080
 It's a natural hierarchical, so you have seven people that ostensibly have the same role,

2:03:26.080 --> 2:03:28.640
 someone is going to emerge as a leader naturally, and some people are going to follow.

2:03:28.640 --> 2:03:34.000
 Yeah, it's the same reason you cannot have the Richard Wolff type socialism of, and this

2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:37.560
 is the more, if you will, innocent part of his ideas.

2:03:37.560 --> 2:03:43.320
 Oh, why can't we have corporations all be worker owned, and everybody votes on everything,

2:03:43.320 --> 2:03:51.920
 and we vote on who should be CEO, and no, communism, fascism, most ideas necessitate

2:03:51.920 --> 2:03:55.880
 ultimately authoritarians, and that's most of human history.

2:03:55.880 --> 2:03:57.260
 We forget again.

2:03:57.260 --> 2:04:01.520
 This idea of liberty, this idea of freedom, even the limited freedom we have today.

2:04:01.520 --> 2:04:02.520
 It's a recent invention.

2:04:02.520 --> 2:04:04.240
 It's a recent invention.

2:04:04.240 --> 2:04:07.080
 It happens in little pockets throughout history.

2:04:07.080 --> 2:04:11.960
 We had a little bit of this democracy stuff, partial, only a few, some people got to vote

2:04:11.960 --> 2:04:15.480
 and it wasn't rights respecting, because they didn't have the concept of rights in Athens,

2:04:15.480 --> 2:04:16.480
 right?

2:04:16.480 --> 2:04:17.480
 You had it in a few Greek cities.

2:04:17.480 --> 2:04:21.140
 We maybe had a version of it in Venice, we had a version of it in city states around

2:04:21.140 --> 2:04:25.960
 the world, but then it was invented by the founding fathers in this country.

2:04:25.960 --> 2:04:29.680
 That's what makes the founding of America so important, and so different, and such a

2:04:29.680 --> 2:04:33.000
 radical thing to have happened historically.

2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:34.600
 Freedom is rare.

2:04:34.600 --> 2:04:35.600
 Authoritarianism is common.

2:04:35.600 --> 2:04:41.680
 So I was looking at some statistics that 53% of people in the world live under authoritarian

2:04:41.680 --> 2:04:42.680
 government.

2:04:42.680 --> 2:04:43.680
 Only 53.

2:04:43.680 --> 2:04:49.480
 Oh, because India is democratic, so I guess they don't count India, but yes, it used to

2:04:49.480 --> 2:04:50.480
 be 100.

2:04:50.480 --> 2:04:51.480
 Exactly.

2:04:51.480 --> 2:04:52.480
 Yeah.

2:04:52.480 --> 2:04:53.480
 How do we change that?

2:04:53.480 --> 2:04:54.480
 How do we change that?

2:04:54.480 --> 2:04:59.840
 And even the authoritarianism in a country like China is a lot less than it used to be

2:04:59.840 --> 2:05:01.560
 under Mao, right?

2:05:01.560 --> 2:05:05.280
 So they were better off than they were under Mao.

2:05:05.280 --> 2:05:06.280
 That's a reality.

2:05:06.280 --> 2:05:08.200
 How do we change it?

2:05:08.200 --> 2:05:12.280
 We have to declare, we have to change the ethical views of people.

2:05:12.280 --> 2:05:18.600
 This brings us back to selfishness, because as long as the standard of morality is the

2:05:18.600 --> 2:05:23.740
 group, others, as long as the standard of value is what other people want, what other

2:05:23.740 --> 2:05:29.280
 people think, as long as you are alive only to be sacrificed to the group, that's why

2:05:29.280 --> 2:05:31.800
 you have to challenge Christianity.

2:05:31.800 --> 2:05:37.880
 As long as the Jesus on a cross dying for other people's sin is viewed as this noble,

2:05:37.880 --> 2:05:42.560
 wonderful act instead of one of the most unjust things to ever happen to anybody, as long

2:05:42.560 --> 2:05:47.560
 as the common good and the public interest are the standards by which we evaluate things,

2:05:47.560 --> 2:05:52.080
 we will always drift towards fascism, some form of authoritarianism.

2:05:52.080 --> 2:05:53.600
 Can I answer your question?

2:05:53.600 --> 2:05:57.160
 I think there's something that has to go along with what Yaron was saying, and I know he's

2:05:57.160 --> 2:05:59.980
 going to agree with me, which is technology.

2:05:59.980 --> 2:06:04.720
 Because if it becomes harder technologically for the authoritarian and more expensive for

2:06:04.720 --> 2:06:10.480
 him to input or force his edicts, that is going to create a pocket of freedom regardless

2:06:10.480 --> 2:06:12.000
 of what the masses think.

2:06:12.000 --> 2:06:15.420
 And the masses, hold on let me finish, the masses as a rule are not going to be able

2:06:15.420 --> 2:06:17.320
 to think in general anyway.

2:06:17.320 --> 2:06:19.680
 I have a much more elitist view of mankind than Rand does.

2:06:19.680 --> 2:06:23.440
 And let me give you one specific example, which I mentioned in my book that you write.

2:06:23.440 --> 2:06:28.440
 Let's suppose it's 1990, not that long ago, we all remember 1990.

2:06:28.440 --> 2:06:31.000
 And we're having an argument about censorship.

2:06:31.000 --> 2:06:35.640
 And Yaron says, I want full freedom of the press, freedom of books, publish whatever

2:06:35.640 --> 2:06:37.640
 you want, whatever, free speech.

2:06:37.640 --> 2:06:40.320
 And I say, well, what about books like Mein Kampf?

2:06:40.320 --> 2:06:42.320
 What about, you know, people read this the wrong idea?

2:06:42.320 --> 2:06:44.560
 What about child pornography, things like this?

2:06:44.560 --> 2:06:45.800
 Like, where are you going to draw the line?

2:06:45.800 --> 2:06:51.300
 And we could argue along, Lex appears from the future, and he goes, hey, guys, this conversation

2:06:51.300 --> 2:06:52.300
 is moot.

2:06:52.300 --> 2:06:54.320
 And we're like, Lex, you look exactly the same.

2:06:54.320 --> 2:06:56.560
 I'm like, yeah, of course, Robo Stone Age.

2:06:56.560 --> 2:06:58.680
 And you go, I'm from the future.

2:06:58.680 --> 2:07:00.480
 And I go, wait a minute, black president?

2:07:00.480 --> 2:07:06.560
 And you go, look, this conversation is moot, because in a few years from now, you will

2:07:06.560 --> 2:07:11.720
 be able to send any book anywhere on earth at the speed of light.

2:07:11.720 --> 2:07:15.880
 You can make infinite copies in one second.

2:07:15.880 --> 2:07:19.880
 And you could send it to anyone such that they can only open this book if they know

2:07:19.880 --> 2:07:21.480
 a magic word.

2:07:21.480 --> 2:07:23.120
 And I go, well, how much is this going to cost?

2:07:23.120 --> 2:07:24.120
 Oh, it's free.

2:07:24.120 --> 2:07:29.740
 And I go, wait, wait, you're telling me I can make infinite copies of any book and teleport

2:07:29.740 --> 2:07:32.800
 them at the speed of light anywhere for free?

2:07:32.800 --> 2:07:35.240
 And you would say, yes, we would think he's insane.

2:07:35.240 --> 2:07:37.140
 But that's the status quo, right?

2:07:37.140 --> 2:07:44.240
 So technology has done far more to fight government censorship of literature and ideas than has

2:07:44.240 --> 2:07:46.160
 spreading the right ideas.

2:07:46.160 --> 2:07:50.440
 So when you have things like crypto, which makes money less accessible than a gold block

2:07:50.440 --> 2:07:55.560
 in your house, when you have things like people being able to travel quickly, those are also

2:07:55.560 --> 2:07:59.520
 necessary compliments to having the right ideas.

2:07:59.520 --> 2:08:03.920
 And Rand herself said that she couldn't have come up with her philosophy before the Industrial

2:08:03.920 --> 2:08:04.960
 Revolution.

2:08:04.960 --> 2:08:09.880
 So as time goes forward and we have more technology and we have more discourse.

2:08:09.880 --> 2:08:12.280
 But for very different reasons, she said that, right?

2:08:12.280 --> 2:08:16.320
 But it's also a lot easier to persuade people the right ideas.

2:08:16.320 --> 2:08:18.600
 So I kind of agree.

2:08:18.600 --> 2:08:22.920
 Maybe I'm more pessimistic or maybe I don't get the technology completely.

2:08:22.920 --> 2:08:23.920
 That's because you're a boomer.

2:08:23.920 --> 2:08:24.920
 There you go.

2:08:24.920 --> 2:08:25.920
 Okay, boomer.

2:08:25.920 --> 2:08:30.360
 I get that insult a lot.

2:08:30.360 --> 2:08:32.520
 I think I'm the last year of the boomer generation.

2:08:32.520 --> 2:08:33.520
 It's a mindset.

2:08:33.520 --> 2:08:34.520
 I think I hit that last.

2:08:34.520 --> 2:08:35.520
 It's a mindset.

2:08:35.520 --> 2:08:36.520
 There you go.

2:08:36.520 --> 2:08:38.640
 I love you so much.

2:08:38.640 --> 2:08:43.600
 So the reason she said she couldn't have developed her, the reason she said she couldn't develop

2:08:43.600 --> 2:08:52.120
 the philosophy without the Industrial Revolution is the link between reason and wealth was not

2:08:52.120 --> 2:08:54.200
 obvious before the Industrial Revolution.

2:08:54.200 --> 2:08:56.960
 And that, for example, it's not obvious to Aristotle.

2:08:56.960 --> 2:09:00.400
 Aristotle doesn't see the link between rationality and wealth creation.

2:09:00.400 --> 2:09:03.240
 Business is low.

2:09:03.240 --> 2:09:10.480
 And money is barren, interest has no productive function, bankers don't have.

2:09:10.480 --> 2:09:18.080
 So you had to see it existentially to be able to see reason is the source of wealth creation.

2:09:18.080 --> 2:09:20.080
 So I think that's a little different.

2:09:20.080 --> 2:09:25.760
 Now, there is a sense in which, yes, technology makes it more difficult for authoritarians

2:09:25.760 --> 2:09:29.360
 to achieve their authoritarianism.

2:09:29.360 --> 2:09:31.160
 I'm not convinced that they can't.

2:09:31.160 --> 2:09:32.160
 I didn't say can't.

2:09:32.160 --> 2:09:33.160
 Yeah.

2:09:33.160 --> 2:09:36.440
 At a certain point, because they can turn off the electricity.

2:09:36.440 --> 2:09:38.160
 I'm just saying it becomes more expensive.

2:09:38.160 --> 2:09:40.180
 It becomes more expensive, no question.

2:09:40.180 --> 2:09:41.440
 It becomes more expensive.

2:09:41.440 --> 2:09:48.400
 And we're still beings that live in a physical reality, therefore, they can still harm us

2:09:48.400 --> 2:09:49.760
 in this physical reality.

2:09:49.760 --> 2:09:52.480
 But let me say this, it's going to sound as absurd.

2:09:52.480 --> 2:09:56.040
 If there was technology that we could teleport anywhere on Earth at the speed of light, that

2:09:56.040 --> 2:09:59.440
 would certainly go a long way towards hurting authoritarianism.

2:09:59.440 --> 2:10:03.320
 If there was some way to go, and of course, they could teleport too.

2:10:03.320 --> 2:10:08.080
 And this is, of course, the danger of they can use the technology too, and look at what

2:10:08.080 --> 2:10:13.520
 the Chinese are doing with social scores and with monitoring people and cameras everywhere.

2:10:13.520 --> 2:10:18.960
 So there's a sense in which you probably had more privacy before some of this technology.

2:10:18.960 --> 2:10:21.100
 So it's not obvious to me.

2:10:21.100 --> 2:10:23.280
 So to me, it's all about ideas.

2:10:23.280 --> 2:10:28.080
 And if we don't get the ideas right, technology will be used for evil, yes, and it will allow

2:10:28.080 --> 2:10:33.920
 some of us maybe to escape for a little while in some realms, but others not.

2:10:33.920 --> 2:10:39.280
 You know, Iran and North Korea do a pretty good job shutting themselves away from technology,

2:10:39.280 --> 2:10:43.840
 although a lot gets through in the Iranian, at least with Iran.

2:10:43.840 --> 2:10:45.840
 I don't know about North Korea, how much gets through.

2:10:45.840 --> 2:10:47.640
 It's really undermining them, which is wonderful.

2:10:47.640 --> 2:10:49.620
 Yeah, which is great.

2:10:49.620 --> 2:10:51.880
 So yes, but it's more than that.

2:10:51.880 --> 2:10:54.640
 And this is what leads me to be optimistic.

2:10:54.640 --> 2:11:00.920
 It's that we live in a world today where 7 billion people basically have access to all

2:11:00.920 --> 2:11:04.400
 of human knowledge, all of human knowledge.

2:11:04.400 --> 2:11:05.960
 It's not like in Rome.

2:11:05.960 --> 2:11:08.560
 When Rome fell, all of human knowledge disappeared.

2:11:08.560 --> 2:11:12.260
 Now some of it escaped to Byzantine, some of the Byzantines had and ultimately land

2:11:12.260 --> 2:11:16.320
 up with the Arabs and found its way back into Western civilization through them.

2:11:16.320 --> 2:11:19.220
 But a lot of knowledge disappeared, just wiped out, right?

2:11:19.220 --> 2:11:22.160
 How to build a dome, how to build a big dome, how to have...

2:11:22.160 --> 2:11:26.440
 You know, in Pompeii, they had faucets, running water and faucets.

2:11:26.440 --> 2:11:30.840
 They didn't have faucets for another thousand years, right?

2:11:30.840 --> 2:11:31.840
 A lot of...

2:11:31.840 --> 2:11:34.600
 They couldn't build tall buildings once Rome came down.

2:11:34.600 --> 2:11:39.400
 The Great Pyramid of Egypt was the tallest building on earth till like 1840, it was crazy.

2:11:39.400 --> 2:11:41.600
 Rome was a city of a million people.

2:11:41.600 --> 2:11:45.440
 Other than China, there wasn't another city of a million people in the West until London

2:11:45.440 --> 2:11:48.680
 in the 19th century, 1500 years later.

2:11:48.680 --> 2:11:53.020
 So it all disappeared because all of it was concentrated basically in one place.

2:11:53.020 --> 2:11:58.040
 Today none of that exists because of the internet, because of universities everywhere, institutions.

2:11:58.040 --> 2:12:01.400
 I mean, think about how many engineers there are in the world today, right?

2:12:01.400 --> 2:12:04.320
 Who have basically all different...

2:12:04.320 --> 2:12:06.840
 Basically the same level of knowledge on how to build stuff.

2:12:06.840 --> 2:12:10.840
 So even if the United States went to some kind of dark ages, it's unlikely the whole

2:12:10.840 --> 2:12:12.900
 world goes into that kind of dark ages.

2:12:12.900 --> 2:12:19.840
 So I am optimistic in that sense that the fusion of knowledge is so broad today that

2:12:19.840 --> 2:12:24.560
 other than wiping out all electricity on the planet, everything electronic on the planet,

2:12:24.560 --> 2:12:27.200
 it's just, it's not going to be possible to control us all.

2:12:27.200 --> 2:12:31.500
 And in that sense, technology is going to make it possible for us to survive and to

2:12:31.500 --> 2:12:35.440
 stay semi free, because I don't think full freedom, but semi free.

2:12:35.440 --> 2:12:37.220
 Because full freedom, you need the ideas.

2:12:37.220 --> 2:12:39.640
 Because full freedom means you need some political implementation.

2:12:39.640 --> 2:12:42.560
 No, full freedom means anarchy, but we know that.

2:12:42.560 --> 2:12:47.560
 So we need to get into that because we can't leave without pointing out that we fundamentally

2:12:47.560 --> 2:12:48.560
 disagree about that.

2:12:48.560 --> 2:12:52.640
 Oh, that's beautiful to be continued on that one.

2:12:52.640 --> 2:12:57.420
 Let me ask about one particular technology that I've been learning a lot about, thinking

2:12:57.420 --> 2:13:02.080
 a lot about, talking about, which is Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general, but Bitcoin

2:13:02.080 --> 2:13:11.480
 specifically, which a lot of people argue that the Bitcoin, that setting ideas aside,

2:13:11.480 --> 2:13:16.320
 when you look at practical tools that governments use to manipulate its people is inflation

2:13:16.320 --> 2:13:19.600
 of the monetary system, within the monetary system.

2:13:19.600 --> 2:13:26.100
 And so they see Bitcoin as a way for the, for individuals to fight that, to go outside

2:13:26.100 --> 2:13:33.300
 those specific government control systems and thereby sort of decentralizing power.

2:13:33.300 --> 2:13:37.060
 You know, there's a case to be made historically of the 20th century that you couldn't have

2:13:37.060 --> 2:13:41.560
 Stalin, you couldn't have Hitler, you couldn't have much of the evil that you see in the

2:13:41.560 --> 2:13:43.800
 world if they couldn't control the monetary system.

2:13:43.800 --> 2:13:45.200
 You couldn't have had the New Deal.

2:13:45.200 --> 2:13:46.920
 And FDR realized this very quickly.

2:13:46.920 --> 2:13:49.360
 That's why they confiscated all the gold.

2:13:49.360 --> 2:13:53.860
 Everybody knows FDR is going to come in to become president and confiscate the gold.

2:13:53.860 --> 2:14:00.960
 So one of the mythologies, the myths about the Great Depression is that there were all

2:14:00.960 --> 2:14:07.080
 these bank runs that, well, bank runs happened because everybody was afraid that FDR would

2:14:07.080 --> 2:14:08.600
 get elected to confiscate the gold.

2:14:08.600 --> 2:14:11.280
 So everybody ran to the bank and took the gold.

2:14:11.280 --> 2:14:15.520
 Little did they realize that he would confiscate their private holdings in their own backyards.

2:14:15.520 --> 2:14:18.240
 He would force them to dig up the gold from their own backyards.

2:14:18.240 --> 2:14:22.040
 But yes, one of the first things FDR did in spite of denying it throughout the campaign,

2:14:22.040 --> 2:14:25.600
 right, he was asked about this over and over again and denied it.

2:14:25.600 --> 2:14:29.960
 One of the first things was take over the gold and take the United States Federal Reserve

2:14:29.960 --> 2:14:34.800
 off the gold standard so that they can, in a sense, print money and that he could start

2:14:34.800 --> 2:14:35.800
 spending.

2:14:35.800 --> 2:14:39.720
 Yeah, what people don't realize, just to clarify what Yaron said, is FDR, this is something

2:14:39.720 --> 2:14:42.920
 that's so crazy to us that we think, okay, I'm misunderstanding it.

2:14:42.920 --> 2:14:48.600
 FDR made it illegal for people to own gold unless it's like a wedding ring.

2:14:48.600 --> 2:14:54.600
 And before that, contracts, because inflation was a concern, I make a contract with Yaron,

2:14:54.600 --> 2:14:59.800
 right, I said, okay, you're either going to pay me in $1,500 for my work or the gold

2:14:59.800 --> 2:15:05.760
 equivalent because if that $1,500, you know, weimar Germany and you have hyperinflation,

2:15:05.760 --> 2:15:07.280
 I don't want that $1,500.

2:15:07.280 --> 2:15:08.800
 Just give me the gold bullion.

2:15:08.800 --> 2:15:15.280
 And FDR said all of those clauses, he broke every contract, they don't matter.

2:15:15.280 --> 2:15:20.280
 So now if I say, Yaron says, okay, you owe me three feet of drywall.

2:15:20.280 --> 2:15:22.180
 And I go, here's three feet of drywall.

2:15:22.180 --> 2:15:23.180
 It's 12 inches.

2:15:23.180 --> 2:15:25.360
 And you go, wait, wait, wait, three feet is 36 inches.

2:15:25.360 --> 2:15:26.360
 I go, no, no, not anymore.

2:15:26.360 --> 2:15:28.000
 It's like, what am I supposed to do?

2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:32.780
 And because you have, when you print more money, the value of every individual dollar

2:15:32.780 --> 2:15:38.600
 matters less, it becomes that much harder to plan anything, either in the government

2:15:38.600 --> 2:15:43.540
 level or in the private level, because if I'm managing outlays, if I'm trying to pay

2:15:43.540 --> 2:15:47.160
 my workers, I'm trying to build factories, I'm thinking long term, and I don't know what

2:15:47.160 --> 2:15:52.400
 this dollar is going to buy in 10 years, that puts an enormous incentive for me to spend

2:15:52.400 --> 2:15:56.720
 it now and not save it, because if I save it, it's going to be worth a lot less.

2:15:56.720 --> 2:16:00.400
 And the worst thing about inflation, and this is something I think people who are pro capitalism

2:16:00.400 --> 2:16:04.020
 don't talk about enough, they do talk about it, I would just like to see it more.

2:16:04.020 --> 2:16:09.140
 This by far hurts the poor, the poorest of the poor the most.

2:16:09.140 --> 2:16:14.160
 When we came to this country, my mom told me they would go to 86th street in Bensonhurst

2:16:14.160 --> 2:16:17.480
 with the fruit stands to buy Mika Chika, some grapes.

2:16:17.480 --> 2:16:21.120
 And you go to this fruit stand, and she'd walk all the way to the other corner.

2:16:21.120 --> 2:16:25.200
 And if it was three cents more a pound, or less a pound, she'd walk all the way back,

2:16:25.200 --> 2:16:26.760
 because that three cents mattered.

2:16:26.760 --> 2:16:32.860
 Now if I have this dollar, and it's 5% inflation or whatever, and next year it's 95 cents,

2:16:32.860 --> 2:16:37.480
 me and you, the three of us might not care, but if I'm destitute hand to mouth, and I've

2:16:37.480 --> 2:16:42.720
 got 5% less, that is really a material consequence of my life.

2:16:42.720 --> 2:16:48.440
 So inflation really is evil, because it hurts the people for who those pennies matter.

2:16:48.440 --> 2:16:52.160
 Well, one of the ways the government gets around that, and it's because they get smart

2:16:52.160 --> 2:16:57.820
 to that, is they index everything, so they index your social security, they index welfare,

2:16:57.820 --> 2:17:01.880
 they try to make sure, but that only makes you more dependent on them.

2:17:01.880 --> 2:17:07.120
 And the people in the modern context that inflation hurts the most are savers, people

2:17:07.120 --> 2:17:08.400
 trying to save money.

2:17:08.400 --> 2:17:14.440
 And Fed policy right now is just horrific if you're a saver, because the Fed, the interest

2:17:14.440 --> 2:17:19.640
 rates are zero, you get nothing on your saving, and cost of living is going up, maybe not

2:17:19.640 --> 2:17:26.960
 at a huge level, but it is going up, and yet you can't even save to keep the value of your

2:17:26.960 --> 2:17:27.960
 dollars.

2:17:27.960 --> 2:17:33.360
 And the government controls, and this has massive perverse effects, because it's not

2:17:33.360 --> 2:17:38.480
 just that prices go up, it's that prices don't reflect reality anymore.

2:17:38.480 --> 2:17:41.760
 So some prices go up, some prices might not.

2:17:41.760 --> 2:17:45.980
 Investments get distorted, things get produced that shouldn't get produced, and then people

2:17:45.980 --> 2:17:50.160
 like Richard Wolff turn around and blame all the distortions, and the perversions, and

2:17:50.160 --> 2:17:53.600
 the crashes, and the financial crisis on capitalism.

2:17:53.600 --> 2:17:57.560
 Not on the fact that the Fed, look at the financial crisis, financial crisis was caused,

2:17:57.560 --> 2:18:01.600
 you could argue by inflation, and we could get into that if you wanted, but that's probably

2:18:01.600 --> 2:18:03.680
 a three hour show, just that, right?

2:18:03.680 --> 2:18:07.680
 It was caused by the Federal Reserve, and yet who got blamed for the financial crisis?

2:18:07.680 --> 2:18:09.800
 Who would Richard Wolff is going to jump up and down?

2:18:09.800 --> 2:18:13.680
 This is a crisis of capitalism, this was caused by capitalism, but capitalism is the negation

2:18:13.680 --> 2:18:15.680
 of the Fed.

2:18:15.680 --> 2:18:18.280
 Capitalism says there should be no Fed.

2:18:18.280 --> 2:18:24.840
 That's item number one on the list of the things capitalists want, is to get rid of

2:18:24.840 --> 2:18:29.120
 the Fed, and then grant you guys your wish, have competition for currency, and let's see

2:18:29.120 --> 2:18:30.120
 if Bitcoin wins.

2:18:30.120 --> 2:18:32.440
 I'm skeptical, but I don't care.

2:18:32.440 --> 2:18:34.000
 My point is under freedom.

2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:39.640
 I don't care who wins, I just want free choices, and let the best currency win.

2:18:39.640 --> 2:18:43.200
 I doubt that becomes Bitcoin, but it doesn't really matter.

2:18:43.200 --> 2:18:44.200
 If I'm wrong, great.

2:18:44.200 --> 2:18:49.560
 Let me add to this, and I think people appreciate, and this is a leftist, leftism at its best,

2:18:49.560 --> 2:18:51.620
 that the government and the banks are in bed with each other.

2:18:51.620 --> 2:18:53.440
 This I don't think is a particularly controversial statement.

2:18:53.440 --> 2:18:56.400
 Well I don't like that statement, let me just say why I don't like it.

2:18:56.400 --> 2:19:00.480
 I don't like it because it assumes that they're equal partners, or that there's causality

2:19:00.480 --> 2:19:02.800
 goes in both directions.

2:19:02.800 --> 2:19:07.720
 From day one, and this is really from day one of the establishment of the United States,

2:19:07.720 --> 2:19:12.280
 banks have been regulated by the state, and the reason for that is primarily Jefferson

2:19:12.280 --> 2:19:16.520
 and others, founders, distrust of finance.

2:19:16.520 --> 2:19:20.520
 So from the beginning, banks have been controlled by the state.

2:19:20.520 --> 2:19:25.600
 Now over time, if I'm controlling you, you won't have influence over me, because I get

2:19:25.600 --> 2:19:31.080
 to, so yes, they get into bed over time, so I don't like it that they're in bed together.

2:19:31.080 --> 2:19:34.640
 One is dominating over the other, and the other is participating, because what choice

2:19:34.640 --> 2:19:35.640
 do they have?

2:19:35.640 --> 2:19:40.320
 I should explain to you how things work when you get in bed, and it's not always equal.

2:19:40.320 --> 2:19:46.880
 Okay, so let's talk about safe words, which is very Randian topic, she doesn't like those.

2:19:46.880 --> 2:19:49.880
 I had to read that scene three times in the Fountainhead, because I couldn't believe what

2:19:49.880 --> 2:19:50.880
 I was reading.

2:19:50.880 --> 2:19:51.880
 I'm sure you did.

2:19:51.880 --> 2:19:52.880
 I'm sure you did.

2:19:52.880 --> 2:19:55.920
 No, because I looked at the back cover, I'm like, a woman wrote this book in 1943, I

2:19:55.920 --> 2:19:57.400
 must be misunderstanding the scene.

2:19:57.400 --> 2:19:58.400
 And it's 43.

2:19:58.400 --> 2:19:59.400
 Yeah.

2:19:59.400 --> 2:20:00.400
 She sure had a lot of shades of gray.

2:20:00.400 --> 2:20:01.400
 Yeah.

2:20:01.400 --> 2:20:02.400
 So, no, she hated that.

2:20:02.400 --> 2:20:03.400
 She hated that.

2:20:03.400 --> 2:20:04.400
 Only black and white.

2:20:04.400 --> 2:20:09.520
 No, but what I meant is, 2008, you have the bailout of Wall Street.

2:20:09.520 --> 2:20:14.280
 Whereas in 2020, we saw every medium and small business under the sun go under, there's not

2:20:14.280 --> 2:20:17.240
 even a pretense that these are going to be bailed out.

2:20:17.240 --> 2:20:21.120
 So the priorities of the politicians, in my view, are always going to be towards powerful

2:20:21.120 --> 2:20:24.880
 entities, powerful corporations, and they're not going to be about the medium guy, the

2:20:24.880 --> 2:20:25.880
 middle guy.

2:20:25.880 --> 2:20:29.520
 Let me just finish my point, because I see you champing at the bit.

2:20:29.520 --> 2:20:33.780
 At the very least, if you have regulation, people influencing each other.

2:20:33.780 --> 2:20:38.280
 With Bitcoin, and with crypto, that is not a possibility.

2:20:38.280 --> 2:20:44.960
 You do not have any agency who is king of Bitcoin, who is the Federal Reserve of Bitcoin.

2:20:44.960 --> 2:20:48.840
 There is no organizing organization or management team.

2:20:48.840 --> 2:20:53.880
 Now, you could say this is a bad thing, but you can't say that this is a different thing

2:20:53.880 --> 2:20:55.800
 to money as opposed to Federal Reserve system.

2:20:55.800 --> 2:20:56.800
 Yeah.

2:20:56.800 --> 2:21:01.480
 So I agree with that description of Bitcoin, my problems with Bitcoin, elsewhere.

2:21:01.480 --> 2:21:07.400
 Let me just say about the financial crisis, I don't like it phrased that way again.

2:21:07.400 --> 2:21:11.660
 They let Lehman go under and destroyed Lehman Brothers.

2:21:11.660 --> 2:21:17.840
 In the past, they destroyed Drexel Burnham because they didn't like Michael Malkin.

2:21:17.840 --> 2:21:19.840
 They are vindictive.

2:21:19.840 --> 2:21:25.540
 It's not an accident that the Treasury Secretary at the time was an ex chairman of Goldman

2:21:25.540 --> 2:21:29.120
 Sachs, not Lehman Brothers, and Goldman hates Lehman.

2:21:29.120 --> 2:21:32.500
 The next day, they bail out AIG.

2:21:32.500 --> 2:21:36.000
 What I got out of financial crisis more than anything, and by the way, there wasn't a bailout,

2:21:36.000 --> 2:21:41.880
 it wasn't even a bailout, because they gave money to every bank, whether they had problems

2:21:41.880 --> 2:21:42.880
 or not.

2:21:42.880 --> 2:21:43.880
 Okay.

2:21:43.880 --> 2:21:48.240
 And indeed, I know several bankers, including big banks, like JP Morgan and Wes Falgo, and

2:21:48.240 --> 2:21:53.460
 a friend of mine, John Allison of BB&T, who told them explicitly, we don't want your money,

2:21:53.460 --> 2:21:57.720
 we don't need your money, and they were basically, a gun was put to their head and they said,

2:21:57.720 --> 2:22:02.320
 you don't take the money, we'll shut you down, basically, the equivalent of that.

2:22:02.320 --> 2:22:09.000
 So they, A, wanted a virtue signal, so there's a big virtue signal, we're taking care of

2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:12.360
 things, don't worry, we've got everything under control, even though they were completely

2:22:12.360 --> 2:22:16.320
 panicking and they had no clue what they were doing.

2:22:16.320 --> 2:22:23.560
 One of the things that the financial crisis really illustrated was how pathetic, ignorant,

2:22:23.560 --> 2:22:27.400
 and incompetent the people at the top are, and they knew it.

2:22:27.400 --> 2:22:31.640
 And they, you know, Sir Paulson goes to Congress, says, give me $700 billion, don't tell me

2:22:31.640 --> 2:22:35.480
 how to use it, because I have no clue, just give it to me and give me your authoritarian

2:22:35.480 --> 2:22:37.080
 power to do it any way I want.

2:22:37.080 --> 2:22:41.560
 And that was not out of a sense of grandeur, that was a sense of panic, he had no idea,

2:22:41.560 --> 2:22:44.740
 he had no clue, none of them did.

2:22:44.740 --> 2:22:50.520
 They bailed out everybody they could, everybody under their, you know, within their periphery,

2:22:50.520 --> 2:22:55.120
 when they thought it was appropriate, they were vindictive about some people like Lehman,

2:22:55.120 --> 2:22:58.560
 it was complete arbitrary use of power.

2:22:58.560 --> 2:23:02.760
 The bankers didn't benefit from this, indeed, many bankers that took their money lost from

2:23:02.760 --> 2:23:03.760
 it.

2:23:03.760 --> 2:23:06.520
 Bank stocks got crushed after the bailout.

2:23:06.520 --> 2:23:10.680
 Before the bailout, bank stocks were doing okay, and right after top was announced, bank

2:23:10.680 --> 2:23:15.480
 stocks crushed because this was bad for banks, it wasn't good for banks.

2:23:15.480 --> 2:23:22.360
 This is just central planning gone amok, it's not them bailing out elites, it's them, you

2:23:22.360 --> 2:23:26.760
 know, throwing money at a problem without knowing what they would actually do and what

2:23:26.760 --> 2:23:27.920
 the consequences would be.

2:23:27.920 --> 2:23:28.920
 Right.

2:23:28.920 --> 2:23:34.280
 But the point is, sorry, where we agree, the focus will always be on bailing out elites.

2:23:34.280 --> 2:23:35.280
 It's almost...

2:23:35.280 --> 2:23:36.280
 But little banks got money too.

2:23:36.280 --> 2:23:41.160
 No, I was saying that last year, there's no talk of saving ice and vice, saving Century

2:23:41.160 --> 2:23:43.160
 21, saving all these other industries.

2:23:43.160 --> 2:23:47.400
 But sure there were, if you look at it, it's just, sure there was, if you look at the,

2:23:47.400 --> 2:23:53.440
 if you look at what the Fed did, the Fed was bailing out third, fourth class businesses

2:23:53.440 --> 2:23:59.480
 in all kinds of areas that you wouldn't consider elitist areas, the whole PPP, the way...

2:23:59.480 --> 2:24:00.480
 You're talking 2008.

2:24:00.480 --> 2:24:01.480
 Yeah.

2:24:01.480 --> 2:24:02.480
 No, I'm talking about now.

2:24:02.480 --> 2:24:03.480
 Okay.

2:24:03.480 --> 2:24:04.480
 I'm talking about COVID last year.

2:24:04.480 --> 2:24:08.840
 What the Fed did was unbelievable, the kind of bonds that they were buying, even 2008,

2:24:08.840 --> 2:24:11.440
 even after 2008, I couldn't believe what they did last year.

2:24:11.440 --> 2:24:18.040
 PPP, the Payable Protection Program was targeted at everybody, everybody got PPP.

2:24:18.040 --> 2:24:19.040
 It's not about...

2:24:19.040 --> 2:24:22.960
 I don't think it's about bailing out elites, it's about securing their power base.

2:24:22.960 --> 2:24:25.960
 And if they believe that securing their power base is Wall Street, then they'll bail out

2:24:25.960 --> 2:24:26.960
 Wall Street.

2:24:26.960 --> 2:24:31.640
 They believe securing their power base is writing checks to restaurant owners all over

2:24:31.640 --> 2:24:34.400
 the country, they'll write checks to restaurant owners all over the country, which is what

2:24:34.400 --> 2:24:36.540
 they did with PPP.

2:24:36.540 --> 2:24:40.520
 It's all about power for them and it's whatever will achieve power, whatever will result in

2:24:40.520 --> 2:24:41.520
 power.

2:24:41.520 --> 2:24:42.520
 I don't think it's about elites.

2:24:42.520 --> 2:24:46.680
 I don't see elitism in the bailouts of last year.

2:24:46.680 --> 2:24:47.680
 I agree.

2:24:47.680 --> 2:24:48.680
 I agree it wasn't last year.

2:24:48.680 --> 2:24:50.800
 I'm saying that's one distinction between 2008 and 2020.

2:24:50.800 --> 2:24:56.120
 And I do think, just one more thing, I do think getting in good bed with the elites

2:24:56.120 --> 2:24:59.200
 is a great mechanism in general for maintaining one's power.

2:24:59.200 --> 2:25:00.200
 Oh yeah.

2:25:00.200 --> 2:25:01.200
 Yeah, that's not a dispute.

2:25:01.200 --> 2:25:02.200
 Depending on how we define it.

2:25:02.200 --> 2:25:03.200
 Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:25:03.200 --> 2:25:04.200
 Yeah, absolutely.

2:25:04.200 --> 2:25:08.240
 You mentioned there's some criticism towards Bitcoin, there's a lot of excitement about

2:25:08.240 --> 2:25:16.640
 the technology of Bitcoin for the resistance against this kind of central state pursuit

2:25:16.640 --> 2:25:17.640
 of power.

2:25:17.640 --> 2:25:19.800
 So that's part of my criticism because I don't think it works.

2:25:19.800 --> 2:25:28.360
 So yeah, I can imagine a world, I can imagine, I'd love to see a technology evolve that where

2:25:28.360 --> 2:25:34.600
 money is competitive and it's a financial instrument that the government cannot touch.

2:25:34.600 --> 2:25:36.400
 You think the state is too powerful?

2:25:36.400 --> 2:25:37.760
 I think two things.

2:25:37.760 --> 2:25:43.160
 I think right now, and maybe this won't be true in the future, right now, I think crypto

2:25:43.160 --> 2:25:44.160
 is ill...

2:25:44.160 --> 2:25:45.600
 It cannot function as money right now.

2:25:45.600 --> 2:25:46.600
 It just can't.

2:25:46.600 --> 2:25:47.600
 But it does.

2:25:47.600 --> 2:25:48.700
 No, it doesn't.

2:25:48.700 --> 2:25:50.880
 It functions as a mechanism.

2:25:50.880 --> 2:25:56.840
 It functions as a mechanism to transfer, it's a technology that allows me to transfer fiat

2:25:56.840 --> 2:26:02.680
 money from place to place, but it doesn't function, and it can't because it's too volatile.

2:26:02.680 --> 2:26:03.680
 I've sold things with Bitcoin.

2:26:03.680 --> 2:26:06.080
 No, I know you have, but I can sell things.

2:26:06.080 --> 2:26:08.520
 I can buy things and sell things with my airline model.

2:26:08.520 --> 2:26:12.480
 So there are lots of ways in which you can use things as money, but it doesn't make them

2:26:12.480 --> 2:26:13.480
 money.

2:26:13.480 --> 2:26:14.480
 If you're using something as money, it's money.

2:26:14.480 --> 2:26:17.640
 So let me take something you said before.

2:26:17.640 --> 2:26:19.360
 And it contradicts, I think, Bitcoin.

2:26:19.360 --> 2:26:22.400
 You said one of the things about money is that it's stable.

2:26:22.400 --> 2:26:24.660
 I know what it's gonna buy tomorrow, right?

2:26:24.660 --> 2:26:28.480
 This is why we're against inflation, because I know what the dollar today I can plan, because

2:26:28.480 --> 2:26:29.480
 I can't plan...

2:26:29.480 --> 2:26:31.240
 I don't know what Bitcoin's gonna be worth tomorrow.

2:26:31.240 --> 2:26:33.200
 So I can't plan with Bitcoin.

2:26:33.200 --> 2:26:35.800
 Bitcoin is way too volatile to serve right now as money.

2:26:35.800 --> 2:26:41.000
 Now, the argument from Bitcoiners is, yes, it's still being adopted.

2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:43.560
 At some point, it'll reach a certain crucial mass.

2:26:43.560 --> 2:26:44.560
 High perfect monetization, yeah.

2:26:44.560 --> 2:26:48.680
 Yes, and then it will become money, because at that point, it can be used as money, because

2:26:48.680 --> 2:26:51.520
 then it'll have a stable value.

2:26:51.520 --> 2:26:56.120
 Maybe right now, it's not useful as money, because I can't predict what...

2:26:56.120 --> 2:27:00.560
 I can't invest in it knowing what the value will be in five years.

2:27:00.560 --> 2:27:01.800
 Right now, it's an asset.

2:27:01.800 --> 2:27:05.160
 It's not a monetary unit.

2:27:05.160 --> 2:27:06.960
 It's much more functions as an asset.

2:27:06.960 --> 2:27:07.960
 Asset's value can go up.

2:27:07.960 --> 2:27:08.960
 Oh, I agree.

2:27:08.960 --> 2:27:09.960
 It's functioning much more as an asset than as money.

2:27:09.960 --> 2:27:10.960
 That's not in dispute.

2:27:10.960 --> 2:27:11.960
 I agree with that completely.

2:27:11.960 --> 2:27:12.960
 So I don't think it's money.

2:27:12.960 --> 2:27:16.920
 But so I think it's still...

2:27:16.920 --> 2:27:20.000
 I think it can compete as a money with something tangible.

2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:25.280
 So I think in a free market, some kind of crypto backed by gold would be more successful.

2:27:25.280 --> 2:27:30.960
 So Bitcoin folks argue that Bitcoin has all the same fundamental properties that does

2:27:30.960 --> 2:27:32.220
 gold.

2:27:32.220 --> 2:27:33.920
 So it's backed by...

2:27:33.920 --> 2:27:39.720
 There's a scarcity to it, and it's backed by proof of work, so it's backed by physical

2:27:39.720 --> 2:27:40.720
 resources.

2:27:40.720 --> 2:27:44.960
 And so they say that's a very natural replacement of gold, so it doesn't need to be connected

2:27:44.960 --> 2:27:45.960
 to gold.

2:27:45.960 --> 2:27:50.120
 So there are two things that gold has that it doesn't have.

2:27:50.120 --> 2:27:52.640
 One is gold is not finite.

2:27:52.640 --> 2:27:54.160
 Gold supply actually grows over time.

2:27:54.160 --> 2:27:56.960
 Bitcoin at some point is truly finite.

2:27:56.960 --> 2:28:02.060
 At least unless you count the fact that you can split bitcoins and create coins, but that's

2:28:02.060 --> 2:28:04.520
 a whole other question.

2:28:04.520 --> 2:28:05.520
 So that's one.

2:28:05.520 --> 2:28:14.720
 The other one is that gold has value beyond its use as a currency, beyond its use as money.

2:28:14.720 --> 2:28:15.720
 For jewelry and stuff.

2:28:15.720 --> 2:28:16.720
 Yeah.

2:28:16.720 --> 2:28:17.840
 But you minimize that.

2:28:17.840 --> 2:28:21.760
 But jewelry and stuff has been important for the human race for 100,000 years.

2:28:21.760 --> 2:28:26.200
 You can find jewelry in caves, for the cavemen designed jewelry and wore them.

2:28:26.200 --> 2:28:29.360
 So we obviously as human beings value jewelry a lot.

2:28:29.360 --> 2:28:33.720
 And almost all jewelry evolved to be made out of gold because whatever it is within

2:28:33.720 --> 2:28:38.240
 us is attracted to shiny gold in particular, shiny object generally.

2:28:38.240 --> 2:28:40.480
 So there's something about gold that appeals to human beings.

2:28:40.480 --> 2:28:44.640
 There's some value that gold has beyond its being a currency.

2:28:44.640 --> 2:28:46.140
 It's not that Bitcoin doesn't.

2:28:46.140 --> 2:28:48.480
 Now it's not enough to use it as money.

2:28:48.480 --> 2:28:50.340
 Lots of things appeal to human beings.

2:28:50.340 --> 2:28:52.280
 But those are two characteristics.

2:28:52.280 --> 2:28:59.120
 One that it's not finite and second that it is a value beyond that Bitcoin doesn't have.

2:28:59.120 --> 2:29:01.660
 Don't you think the finiteness could be framed as a feature?

2:29:01.660 --> 2:29:02.920
 The scarcity of Bitcoin?

2:29:02.920 --> 2:29:07.880
 No, because I think it creates a real problem with scarcity economically.

2:29:07.880 --> 2:29:10.100
 It's the issue of planning.

2:29:10.100 --> 2:29:15.120
 There is a mechanism, there's a beautiful mechanism in markets that as the supply of

2:29:15.120 --> 2:29:21.640
 gold is in a sense the quantity of gold is...

2:29:21.640 --> 2:29:24.280
 Prices are going down because there's too little gold, right?

2:29:24.280 --> 2:29:28.000
 So the value of gold in a sense in dollar terms, the prices are going down.

2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:34.880
 What happens then is there's an incentive to then go mine for more gold, right?

2:29:34.880 --> 2:29:37.800
 Because it becomes cheaper and cheaper to mine as the price goes down.

2:29:37.800 --> 2:29:43.500
 So you mine for more gold, so it keeps increasing and it keeps increasing basically very correlated

2:29:43.500 --> 2:29:46.460
 to the rate of increasing productivity.

2:29:46.460 --> 2:29:51.760
 That's the beauty of gold mining because prices are related to gold, gold is the dominant

2:29:51.760 --> 2:29:55.440
 money and it increases at about the same rate as productivity.

2:29:55.440 --> 2:29:59.920
 So it keeps prices relatively stable.

2:29:59.920 --> 2:30:04.080
 You still have bouts of inflation and deflation, but it keeps it relatively stable.

2:30:04.080 --> 2:30:08.400
 With Bitcoin it's fine at its ends, now prices will only decline.

2:30:08.400 --> 2:30:09.640
 What rate will they decline at?

2:30:09.640 --> 2:30:12.800
 They'll decline at the rate of productivity increases.

2:30:12.800 --> 2:30:15.480
 It's hard to predict the rate at which productivity increases.

2:30:15.480 --> 2:30:19.840
 For example, technological shocks can change that dramatically.

2:30:19.840 --> 2:30:26.180
 You could get bouts of dramatic deflation, dramatic price drops that could be problematic

2:30:26.180 --> 2:30:31.480
 in terms of planning the same problem of inflation just reversed that you had before.

2:30:31.480 --> 2:30:34.160
 So again, it's a technical issue.

2:30:34.160 --> 2:30:35.720
 I'm sure there are ways to get around it.

2:30:35.720 --> 2:30:38.320
 And again, I'm not sure.

2:30:38.320 --> 2:30:43.160
 I don't know if you guys consider Bitcoin the end or the beginning, that is, is Bitcoin

2:30:43.160 --> 2:30:46.760
 it or is Bitcoin just the first example of a technology that's evolving?

2:30:46.760 --> 2:30:51.560
 I was just going to say there's the same technological issue with regard to gold, which is we now

2:30:51.560 --> 2:30:56.300
 have the technology that was very expensive to turn elements into different elements.

2:30:56.300 --> 2:30:59.680
 And at a certain, yeah, you could fire electrons at it or whatever.

2:30:59.680 --> 2:31:00.680
 You can make gold.

2:31:00.680 --> 2:31:01.680
 They figured out how to do it.

2:31:01.680 --> 2:31:04.280
 It's not cheap and it's called big process.

2:31:04.280 --> 2:31:09.680
 If gold is the standard, a lot of resources are going to be going toward turning other

2:31:09.680 --> 2:31:12.300
 things into gold, making the production of gold cheaper.

2:31:12.300 --> 2:31:16.220
 And that's going to have a similar consequence that Laurence talked about.

2:31:16.220 --> 2:31:19.680
 That's kind of the category of security that Bitcoin has talked about, that it's very difficult

2:31:19.680 --> 2:31:21.680
 to do that with Bitcoin.

2:31:21.680 --> 2:31:24.280
 But I would argue that it's exceptionally difficult to do that with gold.

2:31:24.280 --> 2:31:25.280
 It is now.

2:31:25.280 --> 2:31:26.540
 But the thing is, there's not huge incentive.

2:31:26.540 --> 2:31:32.040
 If gold is the basis and if gold is worth that much, gold isn't worth that much.

2:31:32.040 --> 2:31:36.000
 Gold is worth, let's say, I'm saying in this world that we're talking about, in the future,

2:31:36.000 --> 2:31:39.200
 gold is not going to be worth, let's say right now, gold is about 2000 bucks.

2:31:39.200 --> 2:31:40.200
 It's less than 2000.

2:31:40.200 --> 2:31:42.160
 Let's say it's 2000 bucks.

2:31:42.160 --> 2:31:44.480
 That's its price in terms of dollars.

2:31:44.480 --> 2:31:48.320
 So you'd have to, it would have to be worthwhile to create something of 2000 dollars.

2:31:48.320 --> 2:31:49.880
 How much would you be willing to put into it?

2:31:49.880 --> 2:31:50.880
 At some point, you're right.

2:31:50.880 --> 2:31:55.000
 And at that point, I think gold stops being money because it's useless.

2:31:55.000 --> 2:31:59.800
 Once I can create it like silicon, then once I can make out official gold.

2:31:59.800 --> 2:32:02.840
 So I'm just not, I don't think Bitcoin is the solution.

2:32:02.840 --> 2:32:06.080
 I think, I don't know what the solution is.

2:32:06.080 --> 2:32:12.520
 I wish I was that innovative, but I think you need a solution that has more of the characteristics

2:32:12.520 --> 2:32:14.600
 of gold than Bitcoin currently has.

2:32:14.600 --> 2:32:21.440
 And I'm, I guess I'm surprised at a lot of the technologists who view Bitcoin as the

2:32:21.440 --> 2:32:26.100
 end game, where it strikes me as it's a, it's the birth of a new tech, it represents the

2:32:26.100 --> 2:32:29.920
 birth of a new technology and who the winner in that technology is going to be.

2:32:29.920 --> 2:32:30.920
 We have no clue.

2:32:30.920 --> 2:32:34.080
 Bitcoin is one of the players, there are other players.

2:32:34.080 --> 2:32:37.600
 There might be a new technology that is even better than anything we can imagine right

2:32:37.600 --> 2:32:42.280
 now that, so Bitcoin doesn't strike me as optimal.

2:32:42.280 --> 2:32:44.400
 And that we should be moving towards something better.

2:32:44.400 --> 2:32:50.560
 Can you please stop shilling randcoin for five minutes?

2:32:50.560 --> 2:32:51.560
 You know where there was randcoin?

2:32:51.560 --> 2:32:52.560
 There was rand.

2:32:52.560 --> 2:32:53.560
 South Africa.

2:32:53.560 --> 2:32:54.560
 No, I was.

2:32:54.560 --> 2:32:55.560
 The agri currency is rand.

2:32:55.560 --> 2:32:56.560
 No, that's true.

2:32:56.560 --> 2:32:57.560
 No, I mean.

2:32:57.560 --> 2:32:59.040
 Ayn Rand is the South African one dollar.

2:32:59.040 --> 2:33:00.040
 Yeah.

2:33:00.040 --> 2:33:04.840
 Ayn Rand coin was, I was in China in 20, I think it was 2015 or 14.

2:33:04.840 --> 2:33:05.840
 What's that?

2:33:05.840 --> 2:33:06.840
 China.

2:33:06.840 --> 2:33:07.840
 China.

2:33:07.840 --> 2:33:10.540
 I was in China 20, something like that.

2:33:10.540 --> 2:33:16.200
 And this entrepreneur came up to me, she said she's bought this massive quantity of land

2:33:16.200 --> 2:33:19.240
 in this area in China, it's a little secluded.

2:33:19.240 --> 2:33:21.600
 She's starting what she's calling Gold's Gulch.

2:33:21.600 --> 2:33:22.800
 She's serious.

2:33:22.800 --> 2:33:30.000
 And she's issuing, and she issued cryptocurrency based on the land, right backed by the land

2:33:30.000 --> 2:33:34.520
 called rand, but Ayn Rand with a little portrait of Ayn Rand, you know, a little portrait in

2:33:34.520 --> 2:33:35.520
 the marketing.

2:33:35.520 --> 2:33:36.520
 I don't think it went anywhere.

2:33:36.520 --> 2:33:39.520
 You're not going to be a janitor?

2:33:39.520 --> 2:33:42.240
 A janitor in China at Gold's Gulch.

2:33:42.240 --> 2:33:43.240
 Yeah.

2:33:43.240 --> 2:33:46.960
 By the way, I do want to point out something I do enjoy about Objectivist.

2:33:46.960 --> 2:33:52.760
 I constantly talk about Ayn Rand and her vampire novels and that's the joke you're on.

2:33:52.760 --> 2:33:54.160
 Thank you.

2:33:54.160 --> 2:33:59.160
 And inevitably someone feels the need to point out that she did not write vampire novels

2:33:59.160 --> 2:34:00.480
 and her name is actually Ayn.

2:34:00.480 --> 2:34:01.480
 So thank you.

2:34:01.480 --> 2:34:02.480
 Thank you.

2:34:02.480 --> 2:34:03.480
 We've been talking for two hours.

2:34:03.480 --> 2:34:05.240
 I owed her a copy of the Fountainhead.

2:34:05.240 --> 2:34:06.440
 Somehow I thought her name was Ayn.

2:34:06.440 --> 2:34:07.440
 Thank you.

2:34:07.440 --> 2:34:08.440
 Thank you.

2:34:08.440 --> 2:34:10.160
 I love them.

2:34:10.160 --> 2:34:13.840
 So this is a really interesting way of phrasing it, which is...

2:34:13.840 --> 2:34:15.360
 I was kidding with the Ayn.

2:34:15.360 --> 2:34:17.200
 I know you knew how to pronounce it.

2:34:17.200 --> 2:34:18.200
 Yeah.

2:34:18.200 --> 2:34:19.200
 I know you know, you know.

2:34:19.200 --> 2:34:20.200
 Yeah.

2:34:20.200 --> 2:34:21.200
 It just got confusing.

2:34:21.200 --> 2:34:23.400
 I think we all know and we all know that we're jokers here.

2:34:23.400 --> 2:34:24.400
 We're all one.

2:34:24.400 --> 2:34:27.960
 There's no Batman in this conversation.

2:34:27.960 --> 2:34:29.800
 So it's an interesting way to frame it.

2:34:29.800 --> 2:34:32.240
 Is Bitcoin the end or the beginning of something?

2:34:32.240 --> 2:34:37.800
 And I've, as sort of with an open mind and seeing kind of all the possibilities of technologies

2:34:37.800 --> 2:34:42.240
 out there, I also kind of thought that Bitcoin is the beginning of something.

2:34:42.240 --> 2:34:50.120
 But what the Bitcoin community argues is that Bitcoin is the end of the base layer, meaning

2:34:50.120 --> 2:34:53.520
 all the different innovations will come on top of it.

2:34:53.520 --> 2:34:58.440
 Like for example, there's something called lightning network where it's basically just

2:34:58.440 --> 2:35:03.120
 like gold is the end and everything is built like the monetary systems like cash and all

2:35:03.120 --> 2:35:05.240
 that is built on top of gold.

2:35:05.240 --> 2:35:10.560
 Bitcoin is the end in that other technologies are built on top of Bitcoin.

2:35:10.560 --> 2:35:11.560
 That's their argument.

2:35:11.560 --> 2:35:16.880
 I get that and I hear that all the time and I just, I don't quite understand that.

2:35:16.880 --> 2:35:23.040
 And I think Bitcoin has limitations that potentially other cryptocurrencies might not have.

2:35:23.040 --> 2:35:26.520
 You know, my attitude towards something like this is to a large extent, I don't understand

2:35:26.520 --> 2:35:28.120
 this technology.

2:35:28.120 --> 2:35:31.560
 My view is let it play out.

2:35:31.560 --> 2:35:41.320
 I think I have more fear of physical, the ability of the government to crush these things

2:35:41.320 --> 2:35:43.000
 than I think many in the community.

2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:49.200
 So for example, so I gave a talk, Bitcoin, you know, and they were hyping the acceptance

2:35:49.200 --> 2:35:50.200
 now.

2:35:50.200 --> 2:35:52.320
 A lot of vendors will accept Bitcoin and this is great.

2:35:52.320 --> 2:35:54.120
 And I said, yeah, it's absolutely great.

2:35:54.120 --> 2:35:57.000
 More options is better than fewer options.

2:35:57.000 --> 2:36:00.320
 But I said, you know that that could be taken away like that.

2:36:00.320 --> 2:36:05.800
 Now it's true that we could exchange Bitcoin and the government wouldn't know, I think,

2:36:05.800 --> 2:36:06.960
 wouldn't know that we do.

2:36:06.960 --> 2:36:11.560
 But once he's advertising on his website that he accepts Bitcoin or once he tries to turn

2:36:11.560 --> 2:36:17.800
 his Bitcoin into particular goods, once you manifest it in the physical world, now the

2:36:17.800 --> 2:36:18.800
 government can step in.

2:36:18.800 --> 2:36:22.740
 So the government could say, you can't sell anything to anybody using Bitcoin.

2:36:22.740 --> 2:36:24.920
 They can do that and you won't be able to sell it.

2:36:24.920 --> 2:36:26.920
 It will have to go into the black market.

2:36:26.920 --> 2:36:29.480
 But that isn't able to sell it, just sell it in the black market.

2:36:29.480 --> 2:36:31.400
 Yeah, but that's where the government thrives, right?

2:36:31.400 --> 2:36:34.120
 The government thrives on letting you do stuff in the black market so they can decide when

2:36:34.120 --> 2:36:36.280
 to put you in jail or not, right?

2:36:36.280 --> 2:36:40.660
 So if I'm buying a sweatshirt from the government, sorry, if I'm buying a sweatshirt from somebody

2:36:40.660 --> 2:36:45.480
 using Bitcoin, the government can't monitor my exchange of Bitcoin to him.

2:36:45.480 --> 2:36:49.480
 But they can monitor the sweatshirt being sent to me, right?

2:36:49.480 --> 2:36:51.400
 That's where they can interfere.

2:36:51.400 --> 2:36:58.240
 And I think that at some point, to the extent Bitcoin is successful, it will be stopped.

2:36:58.240 --> 2:37:00.400
 And that's what will stop it from becoming money.

2:37:00.400 --> 2:37:02.920
 See, money can only become money.

2:37:02.920 --> 2:37:06.380
 It can only become money if people are using it as money, right?

2:37:06.380 --> 2:37:09.720
 And if the government can stop it being used, if I can't go to the grocery store and use

2:37:09.720 --> 2:37:15.580
 my ATM that charges on Bitcoin or whatever, then it's not money.

2:37:15.580 --> 2:37:21.680
 And I think that the government is going to step in and stop people from doing that.

2:37:21.680 --> 2:37:23.240
 And that's what I...

2:37:23.240 --> 2:37:30.520
 So I have more respect and fear for the power of government today.

2:37:30.520 --> 2:37:31.800
 I don't see that at all.

2:37:31.800 --> 2:37:33.400
 However, I could be wrong.

2:37:33.400 --> 2:37:35.200
 And I'm sure Yaron hopes he's wrong.

2:37:35.200 --> 2:37:36.200
 Absolutely.

2:37:36.200 --> 2:37:37.200
 And in some sense...

2:37:37.200 --> 2:37:42.120
 I hope the government just give in and the Fed tomorrow says, yeah, let Bitcoin thrive.

2:37:42.120 --> 2:37:43.880
 But I think they'll want to regulate and control it.

2:37:43.880 --> 2:37:47.280
 And the only way to regulate and control it is to stop it.

2:37:47.280 --> 2:37:52.200
 Yeah, there's a bunch of people who argue that Bitcoin is too compelling to government

2:37:52.200 --> 2:37:54.640
 that they'll actually embrace it, like a Trojan horse and stuff.

2:37:54.640 --> 2:37:58.260
 But that assumes government has positive goals and wants to do good things.

2:37:58.260 --> 2:37:59.260
 You can ask...

2:37:59.260 --> 2:38:01.080
 No, no, it's greedy.

2:38:01.080 --> 2:38:03.040
 They say government is greedy because they...

2:38:03.040 --> 2:38:05.160
 Well, Bitcoiners have this whole lingo.

2:38:05.160 --> 2:38:07.600
 They say number go up.

2:38:07.600 --> 2:38:09.360
 Government is not greedy.

2:38:09.360 --> 2:38:11.440
 Government is not greedy for money.

2:38:11.440 --> 2:38:13.040
 Government is greedy for power.

2:38:13.040 --> 2:38:15.520
 Government is greedy for control.

2:38:15.520 --> 2:38:16.520
 Government is much more...

2:38:16.520 --> 2:38:17.760
 Now, money is good too.

2:38:17.760 --> 2:38:19.360
 They'll take the money if they can get it.

2:38:19.360 --> 2:38:21.660
 But it's not fundamentally about money.

2:38:21.660 --> 2:38:22.660
 It's fundamentally...

2:38:22.660 --> 2:38:26.000
 And this is something that many libertarians don't understand.

2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:28.640
 This is something many of the Bitcoin community don't understand.

2:38:28.640 --> 2:38:34.720
 They have far too benevolent a view of politicians and the people in government today.

2:38:34.720 --> 2:38:35.720
 By the way, I'm alive with this.

2:38:35.720 --> 2:38:36.720
 And I know why he's laughing.

2:38:36.720 --> 2:38:37.720
 I think I know why he's laughing.

2:38:37.720 --> 2:38:39.360
 You know exactly why I'm laughing.

2:38:39.360 --> 2:38:45.000
 And we should get to that issue at some point here.

2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:46.560
 So I think there's a lot of naivete.

2:38:46.560 --> 2:38:47.560
 Yeah, there's a lot.

2:38:47.560 --> 2:38:48.560
 Speaking of naivete...

2:38:48.560 --> 2:38:49.560
 A lot of it, Yaron.

2:38:49.560 --> 2:38:50.560
 No.

2:38:50.560 --> 2:38:51.560
 Okay.

2:38:51.560 --> 2:38:52.560
 Okay.

2:38:52.560 --> 2:38:53.560
 I'm not naive.

2:38:53.560 --> 2:38:58.440
 I'm actually providing the warning and all these Bitcoiners are saying, no, no, no, government

2:38:58.440 --> 2:38:59.440
 doesn't function that way.

2:38:59.440 --> 2:39:01.000
 No one says I'm naive.

2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:03.680
 Naive people think they're not naive.

2:39:03.680 --> 2:39:05.160
 So let's put this on the table.

2:39:05.160 --> 2:39:11.880
 Speaking of naive, I still more than the two of you by far, I think, have faith that government

2:39:11.880 --> 2:39:12.880
 can work.

2:39:12.880 --> 2:39:13.880
 Okay.

2:39:13.880 --> 2:39:14.880
 Let's put that on the table.

2:39:14.880 --> 2:39:15.880
 I got it.

2:39:15.880 --> 2:39:16.880
 I'm not trying to be pedantic.

2:39:16.880 --> 2:39:19.200
 What do you mean work?

2:39:19.200 --> 2:39:20.320
 Government can achieve goals.

2:39:20.320 --> 2:39:21.320
 That is not a dispute.

2:39:21.320 --> 2:39:28.760
 Government can achieve goals effectively to build a better world, a functioning society.

2:39:28.760 --> 2:39:31.400
 So I'm going to take it one step further than you.

2:39:31.400 --> 2:39:32.400
 Oh, boy.

2:39:32.400 --> 2:39:37.080
 The only way to achieve a better world is through government.

2:39:37.080 --> 2:39:40.120
 Michael, what do you think about that?

2:39:40.120 --> 2:39:41.120
 He almost dropped it.

2:39:41.120 --> 2:39:42.120
 I said it on purpose that way.

2:39:42.120 --> 2:39:45.440
 I'm glad that the mask is dropping.

2:39:45.440 --> 2:39:50.680
 You cannot achieve, you cannot have liberty or freedom without a government.

2:39:50.680 --> 2:39:53.480
 Now not anything like the governments we have today.

2:39:53.480 --> 2:40:00.320
 So I think the idea that you can have liberty or freedom without government is the rejection

2:40:00.320 --> 2:40:06.280
 of the idea of liberty and freedom and the undermining of any effort, any attempt to

2:40:06.280 --> 2:40:07.280
 do it.

2:40:07.280 --> 2:40:10.000
 In that sense, you, Lex, I know, exactly.

2:40:10.000 --> 2:40:12.600
 On this side, I'm in agreement with Lex, which is unusual.

2:40:12.600 --> 2:40:13.600
 That government is good for freedom.

2:40:13.600 --> 2:40:16.040
 Yeah, you're in agreement with the guy who's reading Mein Kampf.

2:40:16.040 --> 2:40:17.040
 That's not a surprise.

2:40:17.040 --> 2:40:18.040
 Who's dressed in black.

2:40:18.040 --> 2:40:19.040
 Yeah.

2:40:19.040 --> 2:40:20.040
 That's the bad guys.

2:40:20.040 --> 2:40:26.000
 But the fascism, I mean, the road to fascism is anarchy.

2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:27.000
 It's not.

2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:28.000
 What the hell are you talking about?

2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:29.000
 Anarchy.

2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:32.240
 Can you give me one example of an anarchy like the fascism?

2:40:32.240 --> 2:40:37.480
 Well, every example of a stateless society leads to authoritarianism, every single one

2:40:37.480 --> 2:40:39.060
 in all of human history.

2:40:39.060 --> 2:40:40.060
 It has to.

2:40:40.060 --> 2:40:43.000
 Wait, wait, you're saying Weimar Germany was anarchy?

2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:46.120
 Well, it wasn't pure anarchy, but it got close.

2:40:46.120 --> 2:40:47.120
 But no.

2:40:47.120 --> 2:40:48.120
 It got close to anarchy?

2:40:48.120 --> 2:40:49.120
 I said the reverse, by the way.

2:40:49.120 --> 2:40:50.120
 I said the reverse.

2:40:50.120 --> 2:40:53.600
 I didn't say that every form of authoritarianism started with anarchy.

2:40:53.600 --> 2:40:59.720
 I said that every situation in which human beings lived under anarchy led to authoritarianism.

2:40:59.720 --> 2:41:01.620
 So I said the flip was right.

2:41:01.620 --> 2:41:03.160
 Anarchism isn't a location.

2:41:03.160 --> 2:41:04.480
 Anarchism is a relationship.

2:41:04.480 --> 2:41:07.280
 The three of us are in an anarchist relationship.

2:41:07.280 --> 2:41:10.680
 Every country is in a relationship of anarchy toward each other.

2:41:10.680 --> 2:41:14.480
 The US and Canada have an anarchist relationship toward one another.

2:41:14.480 --> 2:41:23.920
 And to claim, you know, going back to Emma Goldman, who I love, in 1901, William McKinley,

2:41:23.920 --> 2:41:27.260
 President McKinley, was shot by this guy, Leon Salgas.

2:41:27.260 --> 2:41:31.100
 And it was very funny, but he was a crazy person.

2:41:31.100 --> 2:41:32.100
 And they arrested him.

2:41:32.100 --> 2:41:33.420
 He shot the president.

2:41:33.420 --> 2:41:36.540
 And they go, why did you shoot President McKinley?

2:41:36.540 --> 2:41:39.240
 And he just goes, I was radicalized by Emma Goldman.

2:41:39.240 --> 2:41:40.640
 And she's like, oh, goddammit.

2:41:40.640 --> 2:41:43.880
 So now she's on the lam, she had nothing to do with this guy.

2:41:43.880 --> 2:41:45.640
 She's trying to flee.

2:41:45.640 --> 2:41:47.080
 She gets arrested.

2:41:47.080 --> 2:41:48.760
 They caught her.

2:41:48.760 --> 2:41:53.880
 And she said, and this is the hubris of this woman, which I admire as the subject to be

2:41:53.880 --> 2:41:54.880
 good hubris.

2:41:54.880 --> 2:41:58.860
 She goes, I'd like to thank the cops for doing what they're doing.

2:41:58.860 --> 2:42:02.660
 They're turning far more people into anarchism than I could do on my own.

2:42:02.660 --> 2:42:11.080
 So given everything you've said in these two hours, and then to pivot to being anti government

2:42:11.080 --> 2:42:15.200
 is being anti liberty, I don't feel I have to say anything.

2:42:15.200 --> 2:42:16.200
 Well, okay.

2:42:16.200 --> 2:42:20.040
 For people who are not familiar, if you're, I don't know why you would not be familiar,

2:42:20.040 --> 2:42:26.200
 but Michael Malice talks quite a bit about the evils of the state and government and

2:42:26.200 --> 2:42:33.240
 espouses ideas that anarchism is actually, what is it, the most moral system, the most

2:42:33.240 --> 2:42:36.240
 effective system for human relationships.

2:42:36.240 --> 2:42:41.800
 There's this great book called Atlas Shrugged and the author posits an anarchist private

2:42:41.800 --> 2:42:42.800
 society.

2:42:42.800 --> 2:42:46.400
 She calls it Galt's Gulch, where everything is privately owned and everyone is, no one

2:42:46.400 --> 2:42:50.160
 is in a position of authority over anyone else other than the landowner.

2:42:50.160 --> 2:42:51.160
 That's an anarchist society.

2:42:51.160 --> 2:42:54.400
 There's one judge and one authority.

2:42:54.400 --> 2:42:55.400
 Yeah.

2:42:55.400 --> 2:43:00.800
 And that's what everyone has voluntarily moved there and agreed to be under.

2:43:00.800 --> 2:43:02.400
 It's a very small community, right?

2:43:02.400 --> 2:43:03.400
 Sure.

2:43:03.400 --> 2:43:04.400
 That is right.

2:43:04.400 --> 2:43:06.480
 There's no problem with competing governments.

2:43:06.480 --> 2:43:08.080
 That's the definition of anarchism.

2:43:08.080 --> 2:43:09.080
 What's that?

2:43:09.080 --> 2:43:10.080
 That's the definition of anarchism.

2:43:10.080 --> 2:43:11.080
 Case closed.

2:43:11.080 --> 2:43:12.080
 Okay.

2:43:12.080 --> 2:43:13.080
 End the show.

2:43:13.080 --> 2:43:14.080
 End the show.

2:43:14.080 --> 2:43:15.080
 I got him over.

2:43:15.080 --> 2:43:16.080
 Mission accomplished.

2:43:16.080 --> 2:43:17.080
 Not definition of anarchy at all.

2:43:17.080 --> 2:43:18.080
 I'm all for competing governments.

2:43:18.080 --> 2:43:19.080
 Hold up.

2:43:19.080 --> 2:43:20.080
 You get more cookies.

2:43:20.080 --> 2:43:21.080
 Good job.

2:43:21.080 --> 2:43:22.080
 He did it.

2:43:22.080 --> 2:43:23.080
 He did it.

2:43:23.080 --> 2:43:24.080
 Yay.

2:43:24.080 --> 2:43:25.080
 You're wrong.

2:43:25.080 --> 2:43:26.080
 You brought him over.

2:43:26.080 --> 2:43:27.080
 Red rover, red rover.

2:43:27.080 --> 2:43:28.080
 More Lithuanian.

2:43:28.080 --> 2:43:29.080
 What is this clown stuff?

2:43:29.080 --> 2:43:30.080
 I was Lithuanian.

2:43:30.080 --> 2:43:31.080
 That's my people.

2:43:31.080 --> 2:43:34.880
 Yasnaya Polyana, Miodom, it's honey.

2:43:34.880 --> 2:43:36.640
 No claims of health or nutrition.

2:43:36.640 --> 2:43:39.040
 The other one claimed health.

2:43:39.040 --> 2:43:40.040
 This one no claims.

2:43:40.040 --> 2:43:41.040
 This makes no claims.

2:43:41.040 --> 2:43:45.240
 No, I'm for competing governments on different geographic areas.

2:43:45.240 --> 2:43:46.240
 That's fine.

2:43:46.240 --> 2:43:47.600
 Why does it have to be over geographic?

2:43:47.600 --> 2:43:48.600
 Okay, let me...

2:43:48.600 --> 2:43:50.780
 It's really crucial that it's on different...

2:43:50.780 --> 2:43:55.960
 So you don't have two judges in Galt's Gulch, you have one.

2:43:55.960 --> 2:43:56.960
 And there's a reason why.

2:43:56.960 --> 2:43:57.960
 There's one authority.

2:43:57.960 --> 2:44:04.480
 There's one system of laws in Galt's Gulch that all the people under the Gulch abide

2:44:04.480 --> 2:44:05.480
 by.

2:44:05.480 --> 2:44:06.480
 There's one.

2:44:06.480 --> 2:44:07.480
 There's two because they're in America.

2:44:07.480 --> 2:44:08.480
 No, they're not.

2:44:08.480 --> 2:44:09.480
 The whole point is they're not, right?

2:44:09.480 --> 2:44:10.480
 They're not in America, they're in Colorado.

2:44:10.480 --> 2:44:14.040
 I know, but the whole point of the novel is they've left America.

2:44:14.040 --> 2:44:15.040
 They haven't left America.

2:44:15.040 --> 2:44:16.080
 They've hid themselves.

2:44:16.080 --> 2:44:17.680
 So they're not under the authority of the Americans.

2:44:17.680 --> 2:44:18.680
 But they are.

2:44:18.680 --> 2:44:19.680
 Don't you get it?

2:44:19.680 --> 2:44:20.680
 But they're hidden.

2:44:20.680 --> 2:44:21.680
 They're supposed to be...

2:44:21.680 --> 2:44:22.680
 Hold on.

2:44:22.680 --> 2:44:23.680
 The point is that they're hidden so they're not under the...

2:44:23.680 --> 2:44:24.680
 No, no, no.

2:44:24.680 --> 2:44:29.360
 If the three of us hide, we're still under the authority of Washington.

2:44:29.360 --> 2:44:30.360
 Not if they don't know that we exist.

2:44:30.360 --> 2:44:33.980
 But this is why they haven't established a state, and it's not a government, and it's

2:44:33.980 --> 2:44:43.000
 not in that sense an example of really the way we form societies.

2:44:43.000 --> 2:44:46.720
 It is a private club that is hidden away from everybody else.

2:44:46.720 --> 2:44:47.720
 Fine.

2:44:47.720 --> 2:44:48.720
 I'm fine with that.

2:44:48.720 --> 2:44:52.020
 What happens if an American kills a Canadian in Mexico?

2:44:52.020 --> 2:44:54.280
 What happens in America, it depends.

2:44:54.280 --> 2:44:56.920
 Depends on the nature of the governments of the three places, right?

2:44:56.920 --> 2:45:02.000
 But usually what happens in most of human history is that America will launch a war

2:45:02.000 --> 2:45:04.040
 either against Mexico or Canada.

2:45:04.040 --> 2:45:05.040
 Okay.

2:45:05.040 --> 2:45:06.040
 First of all...

2:45:06.040 --> 2:45:08.960
 So usually violence results in much more violence.

2:45:08.960 --> 2:45:11.520
 Anarchy is just a system that legalizes violence.

2:45:11.520 --> 2:45:12.520
 That's all it does.

2:45:12.520 --> 2:45:14.600
 And in international affairs, that's the reality.

2:45:14.600 --> 2:45:19.400
 The reality is that the way you resolve disputes that are major disputes is through violence.

2:45:19.400 --> 2:45:25.560
 Ayn Rand said, the definition of a government is an agency that has a monopoly of force

2:45:25.560 --> 2:45:27.160
 in a geographical area.

2:45:27.160 --> 2:45:33.280
 So you can't complain that anarchism is legalizing violence when the definition of government,

2:45:33.280 --> 2:45:35.280
 according to Rand, is legalized violence.

2:45:35.280 --> 2:45:40.480
 No, but because you're taking the definition of violence the way she defines it, right,

2:45:40.480 --> 2:45:41.480
 in this context.

2:45:41.480 --> 2:45:43.680
 A, she talks about retaliatory force only.

2:45:43.680 --> 2:45:45.880
 Has that ever happened?

2:45:45.880 --> 2:45:46.880
 That's not the point.

2:45:46.880 --> 2:45:47.880
 That is the point.

2:45:47.880 --> 2:45:48.880
 Before there was Aristotle.

2:45:48.880 --> 2:45:51.200
 Before there was an America, there was an America.

2:45:51.200 --> 2:45:54.700
 The fact that something has never existed means that it will never exist before.

2:45:54.700 --> 2:45:58.880
 The fact that the ideas haven't been developed to make something exist means that it will

2:45:58.880 --> 2:46:00.640
 never exist before.

2:46:00.640 --> 2:46:01.640
 You know, we're young.

2:46:01.640 --> 2:46:03.260
 Human race is a young race.

2:46:03.260 --> 2:46:05.460
 The ideas of freedom are very young.

2:46:05.460 --> 2:46:08.240
 The ideas of the enlightenment are just 250 years old.

2:46:08.240 --> 2:46:13.280
 The idea that you can't create the kind of government Ayn Rand talked about, I talk about,

2:46:13.280 --> 2:46:16.060
 that it's never been before means it will never happen again.

2:46:16.060 --> 2:46:17.060
 That's a silly argument.

2:46:17.060 --> 2:46:18.060
 It's not a silly argument.

2:46:18.060 --> 2:46:19.060
 You're being a Platonist.

2:46:19.060 --> 2:46:20.060
 No, not at all.

2:46:20.060 --> 2:46:22.400
 I'll explain to you how you're being exactly a Platonist.

2:46:22.400 --> 2:46:26.520
 So if I was sitting in 1750 arguing with Thomas Jefferson, he was telling me what kind of

2:46:26.520 --> 2:46:30.320
 state he was going to create, and I said, is a state like this ever being created?

2:46:30.320 --> 2:46:31.320
 And he said, no.

2:46:31.320 --> 2:46:32.320
 Was I being a Platonist?

2:46:32.320 --> 2:46:33.320
 Of course not.

2:46:33.320 --> 2:46:34.320
 No, you're being a Platonist.

2:46:34.320 --> 2:46:35.320
 You know, things change.

2:46:35.320 --> 2:46:36.320
 You're being a Platonist now.

2:46:36.320 --> 2:46:37.620
 Here's why you're being a Platonist now.

2:46:37.620 --> 2:46:41.940
 Because one of the things that Aristotle believed in, one of the things that Ayn Rand in other

2:46:41.940 --> 2:46:48.240
 contexts believed in, the cover of her book, The Philosophy Who Needs It, is, I think it's

2:46:48.240 --> 2:46:50.560
 the Sistine Chapel, the cover, or wherever it is.

2:46:50.560 --> 2:46:52.520
 It's Aristotle and Plato walking.

2:46:52.520 --> 2:46:53.520
 No, it's not.

2:46:53.520 --> 2:46:54.520
 Yeah, but...

2:46:54.520 --> 2:46:55.520
 What's that painting?

2:46:55.520 --> 2:46:56.520
 I forgot what it is.

2:46:56.520 --> 2:46:57.520
 It's the School of Athens.

2:46:57.520 --> 2:46:58.520
 School of Athens.

2:46:58.520 --> 2:46:59.520
 Thank you.

2:46:59.520 --> 2:47:00.520
 It's the Raphael.

2:47:00.520 --> 2:47:03.960
 So Plato's pointing toward the heavens while they're talking, and Aristotle's pointing

2:47:03.960 --> 2:47:04.960
 to the earth.

2:47:04.960 --> 2:47:05.960
 Reality.

2:47:05.960 --> 2:47:06.960
 Reality.

2:47:06.960 --> 2:47:07.960
 Absolutely.

2:47:07.960 --> 2:47:09.380
 So if you want, there's two approaches.

2:47:09.380 --> 2:47:14.600
 There's the Descartes, Cartesian approach, which is I sit in my armchair and I deduce

2:47:14.600 --> 2:47:19.680
 all of reality, or if I want to study the nature of man, if I want to study the nature

2:47:19.680 --> 2:47:23.240
 of dogs, if I want to study the nature of the sun, I have to look around.

2:47:23.240 --> 2:47:24.240
 I have to open my eyes.

2:47:24.240 --> 2:47:26.220
 I have to look at data.

2:47:26.220 --> 2:47:27.480
 It's very difficult.

2:47:27.480 --> 2:47:32.240
 You know, when Rand was on Donahue, he asked her about, aren't you impressed with the order

2:47:32.240 --> 2:47:33.240
 in the universe?

2:47:33.240 --> 2:47:35.920
 And she goes, oh, now you have to give me a moment.

2:47:35.920 --> 2:47:39.360
 And the point she made, which was very hard for many people to grasp, it's hard for me

2:47:39.360 --> 2:47:45.140
 to grasp, is one's concept of order comes from the universe.

2:47:45.140 --> 2:47:51.020
 You can't have a disorderly universe because order means describing that which exists and

2:47:51.020 --> 2:47:52.400
 which has existed.

2:47:52.400 --> 2:47:58.780
 Now, if you are looking at governments throughout history that have always existed, and when

2:47:58.780 --> 2:48:04.440
 you were on Lex, you said, what I'm talking about has never existed.

2:48:04.440 --> 2:48:10.580
 To say that this, therefore, that that has a possibility of working in reality, I think

2:48:10.580 --> 2:48:13.500
 is certainly not a point in that favor, number one.

2:48:13.500 --> 2:48:16.420
 And number two, Jefferson was a fraud.

2:48:16.420 --> 2:48:21.360
 What Jefferson argued how America would look did not come true.

2:48:21.360 --> 2:48:24.880
 Jefferson's concerns about the Constitution were accurate.

2:48:24.880 --> 2:48:29.940
 And the fact is the federal government did become centralized, did become a civil war.

2:48:29.940 --> 2:48:34.420
 So if you told Mr. Jefferson the government you're positing can't work, you would have

2:48:34.420 --> 2:48:36.700
 been correct.

2:48:36.700 --> 2:48:37.700
 That's not what I'm saying.

2:48:37.700 --> 2:48:39.860
 It's not the issue of can it work or not.

2:48:39.860 --> 2:48:45.140
 It's the issue of can something exist that hasn't existed in the past?

2:48:45.140 --> 2:48:46.260
 It's a silly argument.

2:48:46.260 --> 2:48:50.060
 Now, we can argue about the fact of reality, whether such a thing can exist.

2:48:50.060 --> 2:48:53.940
 But to say it hasn't existed in the past is not an argument about whether it can exist

2:48:53.940 --> 2:48:54.940
 in the future.

2:48:54.940 --> 2:48:55.940
 But that's the argument you made.

2:48:55.940 --> 2:48:58.380
 No, no, you're talking about history and now you're dancing around it.

2:48:58.380 --> 2:48:59.380
 No, I'm not.

2:48:59.380 --> 2:49:00.380
 Sure.

2:49:00.380 --> 2:49:04.020
 I'm saying that something different happened in the founding of America.

2:49:04.020 --> 2:49:07.360
 It might not have been perfect, might not have been ideal, it might have been some people

2:49:07.360 --> 2:49:08.360
 even think it was bad, right?

2:49:08.360 --> 2:49:09.360
 Sure, it was different.

2:49:09.360 --> 2:49:10.360
 Something different happened.

2:49:10.360 --> 2:49:11.360
 Sure.

2:49:11.360 --> 2:49:14.140
 And you could have said 20 years before and said, well, that's never happened before,

2:49:14.140 --> 2:49:15.780
 so it can't happen in the future.

2:49:15.780 --> 2:49:17.740
 That is a bad argument.

2:49:17.740 --> 2:49:18.740
 It's not a good argument.

2:49:18.740 --> 2:49:19.740
 Irrelevant.

2:49:19.740 --> 2:49:24.420
 No, but you're making the argument that just because something hasn't happened before,

2:49:24.420 --> 2:49:27.500
 that's certainly not a point to say it's likely to happen or possible.

2:49:27.500 --> 2:49:28.500
 No.

2:49:28.500 --> 2:49:34.460
 I'm saying, first of all, I agree that everything we know about what's possible or what's not

2:49:34.460 --> 2:49:36.660
 possible has to be from reality.

2:49:36.660 --> 2:49:37.660
 That we agree completely.

2:49:37.660 --> 2:49:40.500
 I think anarchists completely evade that point.

2:49:40.500 --> 2:49:48.660
 I think you guys live in a world of mythology, of abstraction, of Descartes, to imagine the

2:49:48.660 --> 2:49:52.460
 kind of anarchy that David Friedman or Rothbard describe.

2:49:52.460 --> 2:49:55.460
 It's complete fiction and it's complete mysticism.

2:49:55.460 --> 2:49:59.700
 Okay, let me ask just a few dumb questions.

2:49:59.700 --> 2:50:06.380
 So first of all, what do we do with violence in terms of just natural emergence of violence

2:50:06.380 --> 2:50:08.180
 in human societies?

2:50:08.180 --> 2:50:15.540
 So the idea that anarchism proposes is that we would, as the community grows, there may

2:50:15.540 --> 2:50:21.500
 be violence and then we together form collectives that sort of fund mechanisms that resist that

2:50:21.500 --> 2:50:22.500
 violence.

2:50:22.500 --> 2:50:28.740
 I mean, I'd love to sort of talk about violence because that seems to be the core thing.

2:50:28.740 --> 2:50:33.820
 That's the difference between the state that was definitionally, I guess, is the thing

2:50:33.820 --> 2:50:39.540
 that has a monopoly on violence or controls violence in such a way that you don't have

2:50:39.540 --> 2:50:40.540
 to worry about it.

2:50:40.540 --> 2:50:44.700
 And then the anarchism, I don't know, I'm using bad words.

2:50:44.700 --> 2:50:49.580
 Your definition is accurate, but the point is that being definition of the state versus

2:50:49.580 --> 2:50:54.020
 how states act in reality is just absurd, yeah.

2:50:54.020 --> 2:50:59.860
 And then the idea that anarchism will be is that it's more kind of a market of defenses

2:50:59.860 --> 2:51:01.360
 against violence.

2:51:01.360 --> 2:51:06.500
 So you have like security companies and then you hire different ones that are more competent.

2:51:06.500 --> 2:51:12.060
 You have things being made affordable, you have more accessibility to security, you have

2:51:12.060 --> 2:51:19.120
 accountability when people misuse their power, and you have more layers of security than

2:51:19.120 --> 2:51:20.980
 having a government monopoly.

2:51:20.980 --> 2:51:25.300
 What every objectivist understand, and they don't deny this, this is something they talk

2:51:25.300 --> 2:51:31.980
 about constantly, is anytime you have a government monopoly, it's going to have enormous distortions

2:51:31.980 --> 2:51:32.980
 as a consequence.

2:51:32.980 --> 2:51:34.300
 It's going to be expensive.

2:51:34.300 --> 2:51:35.300
 It's going to be ineffective.

2:51:35.300 --> 2:51:39.500
 And when you're talking about ineffectiveness in markets, that's not just, you know, like

2:51:39.500 --> 2:51:40.500
 the cup sucks.

2:51:40.500 --> 2:51:42.240
 It often means mass death.

2:51:42.240 --> 2:51:44.220
 It often means persecution.

2:51:44.220 --> 2:51:50.820
 So this is something that anarchism, if not entirely prevents, certainly mitigates enormously.

2:51:50.820 --> 2:51:55.380
 So can I just, as a thought experiment, say it was very easy to immigrate to another country,

2:51:55.380 --> 2:52:00.080
 like where you could just move about from government to government, would that alleviate

2:52:00.080 --> 2:52:04.740
 most of the problems that you have towards the state, which is like people being free

2:52:04.740 --> 2:52:07.660
 to choose which government they operate under?

2:52:07.660 --> 2:52:08.660
 Wouldn't that essentially be...

2:52:08.660 --> 2:52:09.820
 Last scam, yeah.

2:52:09.820 --> 2:52:16.660
 So like what is, I'm trying to understand why governments aren't already the thing that's

2:52:16.660 --> 2:52:18.380
 the goal of anarchism.

2:52:18.380 --> 2:52:23.100
 The kind of collectives that emerge under anarchism seems to be what government...

2:52:23.100 --> 2:52:24.580
 You're equating two terms.

2:52:24.580 --> 2:52:28.300
 So there's something called like private governance and there's government.

2:52:28.300 --> 2:52:34.180
 So for example, if I go to Yaron's house and he has a rule, take off your shoes, become

2:52:34.180 --> 2:52:39.300
 your house, if you want to really be kind of silly about it, you could say he's the

2:52:39.300 --> 2:52:40.300
 governor.

2:52:40.300 --> 2:52:43.300
 But it's really nonsensical to say that.

2:52:43.300 --> 2:52:48.420
 If you go to Macy's, right, if you want to return your sweater, Macy's rules are right

2:52:48.420 --> 2:52:49.420
 up there.

2:52:49.420 --> 2:52:50.420
 You have seven days.

2:52:50.420 --> 2:52:52.580
 If you don't have a receipt, you're going to get store credit.

2:52:52.580 --> 2:52:54.460
 If you do have a receipt, you get a refund.

2:52:54.460 --> 2:53:00.140
 So every organization, every bar, every nightclub, your house has rules of governments.

2:53:00.140 --> 2:53:01.140
 This is...

2:53:01.140 --> 2:53:02.140
 It's often they're unspoken.

2:53:02.140 --> 2:53:03.140
 This is unavoidable.

2:53:03.140 --> 2:53:09.460
 No one in America by law has to pay a tip, but it's just customary.

2:53:09.460 --> 2:53:13.180
 You go at the waiter, you give them 15, 20%, so on and so forth.

2:53:13.180 --> 2:53:20.940
 Now what anarchism does is it says, okay, security is something that is of crucial,

2:53:20.940 --> 2:53:22.740
 essential human need.

2:53:22.740 --> 2:53:26.420
 We all need to be safe in our property, safe in our purpose.

2:53:26.420 --> 2:53:31.700
 The organization that by far is the biggest violator of this and always has been, always

2:53:31.700 --> 2:53:33.580
 will be, is the government.

2:53:33.580 --> 2:53:34.580
 Why?

2:53:34.580 --> 2:53:37.260
 Because it's a monopoly, because it has no accountability.

2:53:37.260 --> 2:53:40.380
 And look at the rioting last year, right?

2:53:40.380 --> 2:53:44.540
 If you have one agency, pretend it's not the government, pretend it's Apple.

2:53:44.540 --> 2:53:47.740
 And Apple has in charge of security in this town.

2:53:47.740 --> 2:53:49.780
 People are rioting, people are looting.

2:53:49.780 --> 2:53:52.740
 And Apple says, yeah, we're not going to send people into work.

2:53:52.740 --> 2:53:56.380
 And if you try to defend yourself, we're going to put you in jail as well.

2:53:56.380 --> 2:54:00.180
 That's the problem of having a government monopoly and that's something that anarchism

2:54:00.180 --> 2:54:01.180
 solves for.

2:54:01.180 --> 2:54:02.180
 Okay.

2:54:02.180 --> 2:54:07.140
 But don't you, cause you said no accountability, don't you mean to say poor accountability?

2:54:07.140 --> 2:54:09.620
 No, I mean to say no accountability.

2:54:09.620 --> 2:54:11.740
 But isn't that the idea of democracies?

2:54:11.740 --> 2:54:13.060
 I'm not for democracy.

2:54:13.060 --> 2:54:18.980
 No, not for democracy, but like the system of governments that we have, there is a monopoly

2:54:18.980 --> 2:54:24.460
 on violence, but there is a, I mean, at least in the ideal, but I think in practice as well,

2:54:24.460 --> 2:54:25.460
 there's an accountability.

2:54:25.460 --> 2:54:26.460
 I do not think that's the case.

2:54:26.460 --> 2:54:30.300
 I know you're a critic of the police force and all those kinds of things, but the military

2:54:30.300 --> 2:54:31.620
 is accountable to the people.

2:54:31.620 --> 2:54:32.620
 I do not agree.

2:54:32.620 --> 2:54:33.620
 The police force is accountable to the people.

2:54:33.620 --> 2:54:35.180
 I do not agree.

2:54:35.180 --> 2:54:37.900
 Perhaps imperfectly, but you're saying not at all.

2:54:37.900 --> 2:54:38.900
 Not at all.

2:54:38.900 --> 2:54:44.220
 And we've seen many examples of police officers doing horrific things on video and they don't

2:54:44.220 --> 2:54:45.220
 even lose their pensions.

2:54:45.220 --> 2:54:47.700
 But there's a lot of amazing police officers or no?

2:54:47.700 --> 2:54:49.860
 I mean, no, there are not.

2:54:49.860 --> 2:54:53.780
 So you're saying by nature, police is like a fundamentally flawed system.

2:54:53.780 --> 2:54:59.140
 No, by nature, government monopoly on police is a fundamentally irredeemable system.

2:54:59.140 --> 2:55:01.000
 Talk about private security.

2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:05.300
 If I have a private security firm, you could have that under a government.

2:55:05.300 --> 2:55:10.880
 And as a result of my private security, my person who I'm bodyguarding gets shot.

2:55:10.880 --> 2:55:14.940
 That's going to be very bad for my company as compared to competing companies.

2:55:14.940 --> 2:55:18.420
 However, when you have a government monopoly and I get people shot, what are you going

2:55:18.420 --> 2:55:20.800
 to do?

2:55:20.800 --> 2:55:25.780
 So the problem is that all the examples are going to be within the context of an existing

2:55:25.780 --> 2:55:26.780
 government.

2:55:26.780 --> 2:55:30.300
 The iPhone example and all these other examples of us being here, we're not an anarchy.

2:55:30.300 --> 2:55:31.300
 That is absurd.

2:55:31.300 --> 2:55:35.260
 We're under a particular system of law and the system of laws applies and we know that

2:55:35.260 --> 2:55:37.800
 the particular system of laws applies.

2:55:37.800 --> 2:55:40.380
 So the problem is when you have...

2:55:40.380 --> 2:55:43.820
 There are many laws that we're not going to be enforced, that we're not going to be subject

2:55:43.820 --> 2:55:44.820
 to.

2:55:44.820 --> 2:55:45.820
 Sure.

2:55:45.820 --> 2:55:46.820
 We know that.

2:55:46.820 --> 2:55:47.820
 Violence related?

2:55:47.820 --> 2:55:48.820
 No, there are lots of laws that are not going to be enforced.

2:55:48.820 --> 2:55:49.820
 Right.

2:55:49.820 --> 2:55:54.300
 And that doesn't make this anarchy because there are the laws out there.

2:55:54.300 --> 2:55:57.180
 They could be enforced, which makes it an anarchy.

2:55:57.180 --> 2:56:00.140
 But look, there's a number of issues here.

2:56:00.140 --> 2:56:03.300
 There's an issue of the role of force in human society.

2:56:03.300 --> 2:56:06.540
 I got to clarify things because I think you misunderstood what I said.

2:56:06.540 --> 2:56:08.940
 I'm not saying that America is anarchist.

2:56:08.940 --> 2:56:11.940
 What I'm saying is the three of us have an anarchist relationship between us because

2:56:11.940 --> 2:56:13.580
 none of us have authority over the others.

2:56:13.580 --> 2:56:14.580
 That's what I'm saying.

2:56:14.580 --> 2:56:16.780
 But that's a bad use of the word anarchy.

2:56:16.780 --> 2:56:18.420
 No, that's the correct use of the word anarchy.

2:56:18.420 --> 2:56:19.420
 It makes it meaningless.

2:56:19.420 --> 2:56:20.420
 It makes it...

2:56:20.420 --> 2:56:23.620
 Every time any people get together, they have an anarchistic relationship.

2:56:23.620 --> 2:56:24.620
 Yes.

2:56:24.620 --> 2:56:25.620
 No.

2:56:25.620 --> 2:56:26.620
 We have a voluntary relationship.

2:56:26.620 --> 2:56:27.620
 That's what anarchism means, voluntarism.

2:56:27.620 --> 2:56:28.620
 No.

2:56:28.620 --> 2:56:29.620
 No, it doesn't.

2:56:29.620 --> 2:56:30.620
 It's a political system.

2:56:30.620 --> 2:56:31.620
 You want to get a dictionary out?

2:56:31.620 --> 2:56:33.860
 You're taking a word and it's accepted usage.

2:56:33.860 --> 2:56:35.860
 And then you're saying, oh, no, it means...

2:56:35.860 --> 2:56:36.860
 You mean like selfishness?

2:56:36.860 --> 2:56:37.860
 Maybe.

2:56:37.860 --> 2:56:38.860
 And we never finished that discussion.

2:56:38.860 --> 2:56:44.860
 You're taking a word, we're taking a word that you're defining and replacing it with

2:56:44.860 --> 2:56:45.860
 voluntary.

2:56:45.860 --> 2:56:46.860
 Now, voluntary...

2:56:46.860 --> 2:56:47.860
 Okay, fine.

2:56:47.860 --> 2:56:48.860
 I'm not for anarchism or voluntarism.

2:56:48.860 --> 2:56:49.860
 Fine.

2:56:49.860 --> 2:56:50.860
 Go ahead.

2:56:50.860 --> 2:56:51.860
 But let's understand what voluntary means, right?

2:56:51.860 --> 2:56:55.660
 For example, going to stores and there's a certain relationship that we have with a store

2:56:55.660 --> 2:56:58.860
 that we engage in certain voluntary transactions with that store.

2:56:58.860 --> 2:57:05.140
 Now, I believe that that works because there is a certain system of law that both the store

2:57:05.140 --> 2:57:08.780
 and we have accepted that makes that possible.

2:57:08.780 --> 2:57:12.700
 Now, if that didn't, there are certain people who would like to walk into their store and

2:57:12.700 --> 2:57:14.580
 just take the stuff, right?

2:57:14.580 --> 2:57:16.100
 So there is a...

2:57:16.100 --> 2:57:19.220
 We might not, but there are certain people who might want it to go into their store.

2:57:19.220 --> 2:57:25.460
 There's a certain system of laws that regulates the relationship and that defines the property

2:57:25.460 --> 2:57:28.620
 rights and then provides protection for the property rights.

2:57:28.620 --> 2:57:30.660
 Now, you would like all that privatized.

2:57:30.660 --> 2:57:33.820
 That is, the store would have its police force and that would be privatized.

2:57:33.820 --> 2:57:39.540
 Now, I don't believe that force can be privatized and there are many reasons...

2:57:39.540 --> 2:57:41.040
 And it shouldn't.

2:57:41.040 --> 2:57:44.340
 I don't think it can and I don't think...

2:57:44.340 --> 2:57:45.340
 I think it's a...

2:57:45.340 --> 2:57:46.340
 That's an interesting distinction.

2:57:46.340 --> 2:57:50.460
 I don't think it can because I think that it's an unstable equilibrium, right?

2:57:50.460 --> 2:57:55.500
 I don't think competing police forces can work.

2:57:55.500 --> 2:58:00.060
 At the end, the police force with the biggest gun always wins and always takes over and

2:58:00.060 --> 2:58:01.060
 becomes authoritarian.

2:58:01.060 --> 2:58:02.060
 That's not true.

2:58:02.060 --> 2:58:03.580
 Look at Iran and Iraq, excuse me.

2:58:03.580 --> 2:58:06.300
 We had the bigger guns, we didn't win.

2:58:06.300 --> 2:58:09.900
 Look at Afghanistan.

2:58:09.900 --> 2:58:13.100
 We didn't win partially because none of that is an example of anarchy.

2:58:13.100 --> 2:58:15.540
 No, but you just said the guy with the biggest gun is gonna win.

2:58:15.540 --> 2:58:16.540
 Yeah.

2:58:16.540 --> 2:58:17.540
 The guy with the biggest gun is gonna win.

2:58:17.540 --> 2:58:18.540
 We didn't win in Vietnam.

2:58:18.540 --> 2:58:19.540
 We had the bigger guns.

2:58:19.540 --> 2:58:22.300
 But again, you're taking it outside of a context.

2:58:22.300 --> 2:58:27.380
 That was a context in which countries are fighting, not a context in which there is

2:58:27.380 --> 2:58:28.380
 no country.

2:58:28.380 --> 2:58:29.380
 Okay.

2:58:29.380 --> 2:58:32.960
 Let's suppose you, Yaron, have a rocket launcher and there's 100 people with handguns.

2:58:32.960 --> 2:58:33.960
 How are you gonna win?

2:58:33.960 --> 2:58:35.340
 You have the biggest gun.

2:58:35.340 --> 2:58:37.660
 Oh, believe me, I could win.

2:58:37.660 --> 2:58:39.340
 With one rocket launcher against 100 people?

2:58:39.340 --> 2:58:40.340
 Yeah.

2:58:40.340 --> 2:58:41.340
 It's just...

2:58:41.340 --> 2:58:43.180
 Well, it depends how many rockets I have in the rocket launcher and whether I'm willing

2:58:43.180 --> 2:58:44.180
 to use them.

2:58:44.180 --> 2:58:48.420
 But that's... so now it's democracy because there are more of them that they win.

2:58:48.420 --> 2:58:55.020
 Look, any one of these scenarios, all it does... so let's go back to the store.

2:58:55.020 --> 2:58:56.020
 This is fascinating, by the way.

2:58:56.020 --> 2:58:57.020
 I'm really enjoying this.

2:58:57.020 --> 2:58:58.020
 I just want to say that.

2:58:58.020 --> 2:58:59.020
 This is great.

2:58:59.020 --> 2:59:00.020
 Because...

2:59:00.020 --> 2:59:01.900
 I'm glad you are.

2:59:01.900 --> 2:59:03.580
 I am enjoying the pain.

2:59:03.580 --> 2:59:05.940
 And I'm also enjoying the comments that are gonna happen.

2:59:05.940 --> 2:59:09.460
 Oh, the comments are gonna be overwhelmingly on your side.

2:59:09.460 --> 2:59:10.460
 I don't think so.

2:59:10.460 --> 2:59:11.460
 I know that.

2:59:11.460 --> 2:59:12.460
 I don't think so.

2:59:12.460 --> 2:59:13.460
 I don't think so.

2:59:13.460 --> 2:59:14.460
 I'm completely dishonest.

2:59:14.460 --> 2:59:15.460
 I'm a modern day...

2:59:15.460 --> 2:59:16.460
 What's his name?

2:59:16.460 --> 2:59:17.460
 What's the guy who is defending communism?

2:59:17.460 --> 2:59:18.460
 Richard Wolff.

2:59:18.460 --> 2:59:21.580
 I'm a modern day Richard Wolff.

2:59:21.580 --> 2:59:27.820
 There's a sense in which I think anarchists are evading reality in the same sense.

2:59:27.820 --> 2:59:28.820
 So we've got this...

2:59:28.820 --> 2:59:31.700
 Do you think I'm dishonest or delusional?

2:59:31.700 --> 2:59:35.860
 Calling someone dishonest is a really specific...

2:59:35.860 --> 2:59:36.860
 I think you're delusional.

2:59:36.860 --> 2:59:37.860
 I think you're delusional.

2:59:37.860 --> 2:59:42.300
 And I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt of being delusional.

2:59:42.300 --> 2:59:43.300
 That's fair.

2:59:43.300 --> 2:59:44.300
 What is love?

2:59:44.300 --> 2:59:51.980
 And as I said on the show, on the previous interview, I said, only smart people can be

2:59:51.980 --> 2:59:56.960
 anarchists because it requires a certain level of abstraction of being divorced from reality

2:59:56.960 --> 2:59:59.780
 that is hard for people who are actually connected to reality.

2:59:59.780 --> 3:00:03.220
 He makes a good point because I always talk about this with people on social media and

3:00:03.220 --> 3:00:07.460
 they talk about a lot of people who buy into the corporate media narrative and how they're

3:00:07.460 --> 3:00:08.460
 dumb.

3:00:08.460 --> 3:00:10.780
 I go, it's easier to train smart people than dumb people.

3:00:10.780 --> 3:00:13.980
 It's easier to convince smart people of the systemic that's divorced from reality than

3:00:13.980 --> 3:00:14.980
 somebody's dumb.

3:00:14.980 --> 3:00:15.980
 You can deal in abstracts.

3:00:15.980 --> 3:00:20.380
 I don't have to deal with the concretes that actually happen.

3:00:20.380 --> 3:00:23.420
 This is an example I gave debating another anarchist.

3:00:23.420 --> 3:00:24.420
 So...

3:00:24.420 --> 3:00:25.420
 Who was it?

3:00:25.420 --> 3:00:26.420
 She must have sucked.

3:00:26.420 --> 3:00:27.420
 Well, you were the best.

3:00:27.420 --> 3:00:28.420
 They were Hoppe fans.

3:00:28.420 --> 3:00:29.420
 Oh, okay.

3:00:29.420 --> 3:00:30.420
 Hoppe, okay.

3:00:30.420 --> 3:00:31.420
 Hoppe fans.

3:00:31.420 --> 3:00:33.340
 Not one of my least like...

3:00:33.340 --> 3:00:37.500
 The people I like least in the world out there.

3:00:37.500 --> 3:00:40.980
 You like them better than the communists, don't you?

3:00:40.980 --> 3:00:41.980
 Barely.

3:00:41.980 --> 3:00:42.980
 Oh, come on.

3:00:42.980 --> 3:00:43.980
 Seriously?

3:00:43.980 --> 3:00:44.980
 Yes.

3:00:44.980 --> 3:00:45.980
 Because I think it leads to the same place.

3:00:45.980 --> 3:00:46.980
 I really do.

3:00:46.980 --> 3:00:47.980
 I think it leads to gulags.

3:00:47.980 --> 3:00:48.980
 Fine.

3:00:48.980 --> 3:00:49.980
 I think anarchy leads to gulags.

3:00:49.980 --> 3:00:50.980
 And I think Hoppe's view of anarchy definitely leads to gulags.

3:00:50.980 --> 3:00:53.140
 I'll grant you just for the sake of argument that it leads to gulags.

3:00:53.140 --> 3:00:58.220
 However, surely you concede that they are against gulags whereas the commies have no

3:00:58.220 --> 3:00:59.220
 problem with it.

3:00:59.220 --> 3:01:00.220
 And that's a big...

3:01:00.220 --> 3:01:01.220
 I think some do.

3:01:01.220 --> 3:01:03.220
 I'm not sure people like Hoppe do.

3:01:03.220 --> 3:01:07.980
 Because if you read some of his stuff, one wonders, right?

3:01:07.980 --> 3:01:09.860
 But he wants monarchies and he wants...

3:01:09.860 --> 3:01:13.300
 No, he said monarchies are preferable to democracy, which is true.

3:01:13.300 --> 3:01:14.300
 No, it's not.

3:01:14.300 --> 3:01:15.300
 Oh, God.

3:01:15.300 --> 3:01:17.060
 I mean, one of the problems with an anarchist is...

3:01:17.060 --> 3:01:18.060
 What judge?

3:01:18.060 --> 3:01:19.060
 That's the monarch.

3:01:19.060 --> 3:01:20.060
 One of the problems...

3:01:20.060 --> 3:01:21.060
 Yeah.

3:01:21.060 --> 3:01:22.060
 One judge, one authority.

3:01:22.060 --> 3:01:23.060
 This is why I think...

3:01:23.060 --> 3:01:24.060
 Yeah, the monarch.

3:01:24.060 --> 3:01:25.060
 That's why I think...

3:01:25.060 --> 3:01:26.060
 So you're a Hoppean.

3:01:26.060 --> 3:01:27.060
 I don't think it's authoritarians.

3:01:27.060 --> 3:01:28.060
 So Yaron Brooks is a Hoppean.

3:01:28.060 --> 3:01:29.060
 Get in the chopper.

3:01:29.060 --> 3:01:30.060
 No, I'm not a Hoppean.

3:01:30.060 --> 3:01:31.060
 I don't want one judge.

3:01:31.060 --> 3:01:33.100
 I don't want an arbitrary judge.

3:01:33.100 --> 3:01:34.780
 I want an objective judge.

3:01:34.780 --> 3:01:37.940
 There's an essay by John Hasnas, I think his name, I'm gonna bungle it.

3:01:37.940 --> 3:01:40.180
 It's gonna be in my upcoming book on anarchism.

3:01:40.180 --> 3:01:44.660
 And he just discusses, and it's a very long, complicated, technical issue, that the idea

3:01:44.660 --> 3:01:46.700
 of objective law is incoherent.

3:01:46.700 --> 3:01:47.700
 Well, yeah.

3:01:47.700 --> 3:01:49.980
 I mean, that's why we disagree so much.

3:01:49.980 --> 3:01:50.980
 Yeah.

3:01:50.980 --> 3:01:53.200
 Because I think objective law is the only coherent system.

3:01:53.200 --> 3:02:01.740
 Do you disagree that we, in effect, have competing systems of law under America?

3:02:01.740 --> 3:02:04.020
 Meaning there's different ideologies.

3:02:04.020 --> 3:02:08.220
 You have the Sotomayor ideology versus the Scalia ideology, and that effectively.

3:02:08.220 --> 3:02:12.780
 And the point being, when you and I file a lawsuit, it completely depends on who the

3:02:12.780 --> 3:02:13.780
 judge is.

3:02:13.780 --> 3:02:14.780
 Yes.

3:02:14.780 --> 3:02:15.780
 Okay.

3:02:15.780 --> 3:02:18.180
 And in theory, I don't think the system works this way, but in theory, the way the system

3:02:18.180 --> 3:02:23.380
 would work is that on new issues, there is some competition.

3:02:23.380 --> 3:02:26.700
 Syria wasn't talking to you.

3:02:26.700 --> 3:02:27.700
 Technology.

3:02:27.700 --> 3:02:28.700
 Capitalism.

3:02:28.700 --> 3:02:34.020
 So in theory, the system works, and this works, I think, with competing states, but also with

3:02:34.020 --> 3:02:38.460
 competing legal views, particularly on a new issue.

3:02:38.460 --> 3:02:42.220
 There's some, this is how common law worked, right?

3:02:42.220 --> 3:02:46.820
 There's some evolution of it, and at some point, that gets codified into the law.

3:02:46.820 --> 3:02:48.540
 And it gets objectified in that sense.

3:02:48.540 --> 3:02:51.640
 That is, there's some conclusion that people come to.

3:02:51.640 --> 3:02:56.500
 This is the role, in theory, of a legislature, and the legislature would be nice if it was

3:02:56.500 --> 3:03:01.420
 composed of people who had some idea of legal philosophy.

3:03:01.420 --> 3:03:03.620
 And it gets codified.

3:03:03.620 --> 3:03:08.140
 Because these things are complex, and at some point, it goes through all the arguments,

3:03:08.140 --> 3:03:12.480
 and then a certain truth emerges, or a certain truth is identified, and that's what gets

3:03:12.480 --> 3:03:14.020
 encoded in law.

3:03:14.020 --> 3:03:15.900
 That's what the purpose of a legislature is.

3:03:15.900 --> 3:03:22.060
 Now, if you have competing mechanisms that don't converge on one authority, because there's

3:03:22.060 --> 3:03:24.420
 no one authority, there are multiple authorities.

3:03:24.420 --> 3:03:30.020
 That is, in a sense, there are multiple governments or multiple systems of enforcement, right?

3:03:30.020 --> 3:03:38.060
 Then you get not just something emerging out of it, what you get is competing legal systems.

3:03:38.060 --> 3:03:44.660
 Competing legal systems that now have competing mechanisms of enforcement, competing police

3:03:44.660 --> 3:03:47.980
 forces, competing militaries, however we want to define it.

3:03:47.980 --> 3:03:50.500
 And now there's no mechanism to resolve that.

3:03:50.500 --> 3:03:55.180
 Now, yes, we could negotiate, and there's goodwill, and so on, right?

3:03:55.180 --> 3:03:56.180
 Yeah, there you go.

3:03:56.180 --> 3:03:57.180
 No, no.

3:03:57.180 --> 3:04:04.420
 But now we're talking about the law, what each view, each position views as true and

3:04:04.420 --> 3:04:06.180
 right, right?

3:04:06.180 --> 3:04:11.100
 And it might involve, for example, it might involve the fact that the legal system has

3:04:11.100 --> 3:04:15.180
 come to the conclusion that it's okay for children to have sex with adults, and this

3:04:15.180 --> 3:04:19.540
 legal system thinks that is evil and wrong, right?

3:04:19.540 --> 3:04:23.860
 And something has happened between the two, right?

3:04:23.860 --> 3:04:24.860
 How do you resolve that conflict?

3:04:24.860 --> 3:04:25.860
 There is no resolution.

3:04:25.860 --> 3:04:30.420
 If this adult wants to have sex with this child, this legal system thinks it's okay,

3:04:30.420 --> 3:04:31.740
 that legal system thinks it's...

3:04:31.740 --> 3:04:35.620
 The only way to resolve that system is through one system imposing itself on the other.

3:04:35.620 --> 3:04:37.600
 An example of countries is exactly that.

3:04:37.600 --> 3:04:41.940
 When you had monarchies, when you had the little states all over the place, the way

3:04:41.940 --> 3:04:46.540
 any kind of dispute was resolved when there were issues of territorial disputes, or issues

3:04:46.540 --> 3:04:51.220
 of marriage, or issues of different legal interpretations about... was war.

3:04:51.220 --> 3:04:52.220
 No, it wasn't.

3:04:52.220 --> 3:04:53.220
 Yes, it was.

3:04:53.220 --> 3:04:54.220
 It wasn't marriage.

3:04:54.220 --> 3:04:56.260
 A lot of times people would marry a princess from another country just to feast.

3:04:56.260 --> 3:04:57.260
 Sure.

3:04:57.260 --> 3:04:58.700
 Forced marriages, which was not very pleasant.

3:04:58.700 --> 3:05:00.900
 I'd rather sacrifice one princess than a queen.

3:05:00.900 --> 3:05:02.940
 No, I don't want to sacrifice anybody.

3:05:02.940 --> 3:05:03.940
 And in addition, I don't want to sacrifice anybody.

3:05:03.940 --> 3:05:04.940
 I want to sacrifice the royals.

3:05:04.940 --> 3:05:05.940
 And in addition...

3:05:05.940 --> 3:05:06.940
 Well, I don't want royals.

3:05:06.940 --> 3:05:07.940
 I don't want royals.

3:05:07.940 --> 3:05:08.940
 Well, that's what sacrificing means.

3:05:08.940 --> 3:05:09.940
 I think royals are pretty disgusting.

3:05:09.940 --> 3:05:10.940
 Agreed.

3:05:10.940 --> 3:05:11.940
 Let's get the baskets.

3:05:11.940 --> 3:05:16.260
 And then on top of that, look, those periods in history are filled with violence, much

3:05:16.260 --> 3:05:20.740
 more violence than we have today, much more bloody than they are today, far less freedom

3:05:20.740 --> 3:05:21.740
 than we have today in terms of individual freedom.

3:05:21.740 --> 3:05:22.740
 After the 20th...

3:05:22.740 --> 3:05:25.740
 You're comparing this to 20th century.

3:05:25.740 --> 3:05:30.340
 Yes, I'm comparing a monarchy, right?

3:05:30.340 --> 3:05:32.660
 You said that's preferable to democracy, right?

3:05:32.660 --> 3:05:33.660
 Yes, I did.

3:05:33.660 --> 3:05:34.660
 I'm comparing...

3:05:34.660 --> 3:05:35.660
 I'm saying Hoppe said that.

3:05:35.660 --> 3:05:36.660
 I'm not saying I'm saying that.

3:05:36.660 --> 3:05:37.660
 I'm saying Hoppe said that.

3:05:37.660 --> 3:05:38.660
 To some extent.

3:05:38.660 --> 3:05:39.660
 To some extent.

3:05:39.660 --> 3:05:40.660
 But I'm not going to die in that hell.

3:05:40.660 --> 3:05:41.660
 Hoppe said that.

3:05:41.660 --> 3:05:42.660
 And I think it's ridiculous.

3:05:42.660 --> 3:05:43.660
 These kings and queens were fighting constantly.

3:05:43.660 --> 3:05:47.660
 I mean, the wars back then were violent in a way that...

3:05:47.660 --> 3:05:48.660
 Unlike now?

3:05:48.660 --> 3:05:49.660
 No, much more violent than now.

3:05:49.660 --> 3:05:51.660
 If you look at the actual percentage of people killed in war...

3:05:51.660 --> 3:05:52.660
 The Steven Pinker book.

3:05:52.660 --> 3:05:53.660
 Yeah.

3:05:53.660 --> 3:05:54.660
 If you look at the percentage of people...

3:05:54.660 --> 3:05:55.660
 And not just that.

3:05:55.660 --> 3:05:56.660
 You can look at the other stats.

3:05:56.660 --> 3:05:59.100
 The percentage of people killed in war back then were far greater than the percentage

3:05:59.100 --> 3:06:01.740
 of people even during World War II and World War I.

3:06:01.740 --> 3:06:07.860
 So anarchy, and you know, David Friedman loves to quote the sagas of Iceland about how wonderful

3:06:07.860 --> 3:06:08.860
 the anarchy...

3:06:08.860 --> 3:06:13.180
 And I mean, it's funny because a lot of people who read David Friedman never read the sagas.

3:06:13.180 --> 3:06:14.380
 It's worth reading.

3:06:14.380 --> 3:06:19.300
 The sagas of the Iceland are filled with violence.

3:06:19.300 --> 3:06:20.300
 Constant violence.

3:06:20.300 --> 3:06:25.380
 Constantly people killing each other over, you know, I stole your chickens and you slept

3:06:25.380 --> 3:06:27.140
 with my wife.

3:06:27.140 --> 3:06:31.300
 The only way to resolve disputes, the only way to resolve disputes was violence.

3:06:31.300 --> 3:06:34.820
 There was no authority, there was no mechanism to resolve these disputes.

3:06:34.820 --> 3:06:38.100
 There was a council, but the council couldn't enforce anything, so in the end of the day

3:06:38.100 --> 3:06:39.840
 we just resolved to violence.

3:06:39.840 --> 3:06:46.620
 And this is legalized because there is no mechanism by which to make the violence illegal.

3:06:46.620 --> 3:06:58.340
 So all anarchy is, is legalized violence constrained for a while and up until people stop that

3:06:58.340 --> 3:07:04.100
 constraint by, you know, arrangements between the security organizations.

3:07:04.100 --> 3:07:08.660
 But the security organizations have us by the balls, to put it figuratively, right?

3:07:08.660 --> 3:07:09.660
 They really do.

3:07:09.660 --> 3:07:10.660
 Sure.

3:07:10.660 --> 3:07:11.660
 Unlike the state?

3:07:11.660 --> 3:07:15.660
 Oh, the state today has it, but I would much rather live in this state, much rather live

3:07:15.660 --> 3:07:20.180
 in this state, much rather live in many more authoritarian states than this, than a place

3:07:20.180 --> 3:07:22.700
 where there's constant violence.

3:07:22.700 --> 3:07:24.340
 I have a bunch of questions, but I'm enjoying this.

3:07:24.340 --> 3:07:25.820
 Here's why everything he said is wrong.

3:07:25.820 --> 3:07:26.820
 Okay, yes.

3:07:26.820 --> 3:07:33.540
 Well, the idea of competing legal systems is inevitable because what Rand talked about

3:07:33.540 --> 3:07:39.240
 is what she wanted was, and this is really kind of out of character with her broader

3:07:39.240 --> 3:07:43.960
 ideology is, I think this was her term and I'm not saying this to make fun of you, when

3:07:43.960 --> 3:07:49.540
 she has a judge and he's looking at the information, she wants him to be basically, I think she's

3:07:49.540 --> 3:07:52.600
 the word robot, someone without any ideology.

3:07:52.600 --> 3:07:56.780
 That they're just looking at the facts, they're not bringing their kind of worldview to it.

3:07:56.780 --> 3:07:58.220
 I take it as a compliment.

3:07:58.220 --> 3:08:01.060
 You are welcome.

3:08:01.060 --> 3:08:11.880
 I think that given otherwise, her correct view that ideology is just a slur for someone's

3:08:11.880 --> 3:08:17.140
 philosophy that someone, especially someone as erudite, educated and informed as a judge

3:08:17.140 --> 3:08:23.620
 has to, and in fact should bring their ideology to their work is in one sense a little contradiction

3:08:23.620 --> 3:08:25.220
 in her view, number one.

3:08:25.220 --> 3:08:31.080
 Number two is we have right now the DA in San Francisco, I forget his name.

3:08:31.080 --> 3:08:36.180
 He's the son of literal terrorists, communist terrorists, and he has made it the decree

3:08:36.180 --> 3:08:41.500
 unilaterally that if you shoplift for less than, I forget, $200, we're not prosecuting.

3:08:41.500 --> 3:08:42.500
 Yeah, I know that.

3:08:42.500 --> 3:08:44.020
 You know this guy, right, right, right.

3:08:44.020 --> 3:08:51.300
 So now you and I, and Lex I'm sure probably, agree that his ideology is abhorrent, that

3:08:51.300 --> 3:08:57.220
 this doesn't help poor people, it doesn't help shop owners, it creates a culture, an

3:08:57.220 --> 3:09:00.700
 area where it's just deleterious to human life.

3:09:00.700 --> 3:09:07.180
 However, he has in one sense, given that he is a state operative, a legitimate worldview.

3:09:07.180 --> 3:09:08.660
 Can I ask you just a quick question?

3:09:08.660 --> 3:09:09.660
 Sure.

3:09:09.660 --> 3:09:15.620
 Why couldn't a security force in a particular context say, yeah, if you take stuff on that

3:09:15.620 --> 3:09:18.940
 store, we're not going to have any problem with that?

3:09:18.940 --> 3:09:19.940
 I agree with you.

3:09:19.940 --> 3:09:20.940
 That's very fair.

3:09:20.940 --> 3:09:21.940
 That's a very legitimate question.

3:09:21.940 --> 3:09:27.320
 The point is, in the context that I'm talking about, that firm is like, wait a minute, I'm

3:09:27.320 --> 3:09:31.840
 hiring you for security, you're saying we're not going to provide security, why am I writing

3:09:31.840 --> 3:09:32.840
 you a check?

3:09:32.840 --> 3:09:34.860
 And we have examples of this in real life.

3:09:34.860 --> 3:09:38.380
 If I get into a car accident with you, right?

3:09:38.380 --> 3:09:41.720
 You have your car insurance, I have my car insurance.

3:09:41.720 --> 3:09:45.380
 If your car insurance had their druthers, they wouldn't pay me one penny.

3:09:45.380 --> 3:09:49.020
 If my car insurance didn't have their druthers, they wouldn't pay you one penny.

3:09:49.020 --> 3:09:53.180
 We already have all, you were saying earlier that we need to have one kind of umbrella

3:09:53.180 --> 3:09:54.480
 mechanism of use.

3:09:54.480 --> 3:09:59.220
 There are already more cases than you can count where there's private arbitration.

3:09:59.220 --> 3:10:04.020
 Now the argument is that private arbitration only works because they have recourse to the

3:10:04.020 --> 3:10:05.020
 government.

3:10:05.020 --> 3:10:09.460
 But my point is, there's many examples where even though that recourse is theoretically

3:10:09.460 --> 3:10:16.460
 possible, it's not a realistic concern, specifically because they know that if you have recourse

3:10:16.460 --> 3:10:22.180
 to the state, you have no concept of what that outcome is going to look like, except

3:10:22.180 --> 3:10:28.340
 knowing it's going to be exorbitant, it's going to be time consuming.

3:10:28.340 --> 3:10:29.980
 We can't use the state, right?

3:10:29.980 --> 3:10:33.620
 I mean, I'm as critical as the state as it is right now.

3:10:33.620 --> 3:10:36.980
 Maybe not as critical as yours, not as critical as yours, but I'm quite critical of the state

3:10:36.980 --> 3:10:38.980
 as it is right now.

3:10:38.980 --> 3:10:45.340
 But let's say we got into a traffic accident and you have a Rolls Royce and I destroyed

3:10:45.340 --> 3:10:49.660
 your Rolls Royce and my insurance company now owes your insurance company a lot of money.

3:10:49.660 --> 3:10:51.780
 And let's imagine it's a lot of money just for the sake of it.

3:10:51.780 --> 3:10:52.780
 You're clearly guilty.

3:10:52.780 --> 3:10:54.020
 Yeah, clearly guilty.

3:10:54.020 --> 3:10:59.820
 And my insurance company looks at the books and it goes, I don't want to pay this.

3:10:59.820 --> 3:11:00.820
 And you know what?

3:11:00.820 --> 3:11:03.060
 I've got bigger guns than his insurance company.

3:11:03.060 --> 3:11:05.580
 And I'm just going to take over their insurance company.

3:11:05.580 --> 3:11:12.220
 And hostile takeover takes on a whole new meaning when I can muster guns on my behalf

3:11:12.220 --> 3:11:17.900
 than in a hostile takeover in a capitalist context.

3:11:17.900 --> 3:11:19.180
 That to me is what happens.

3:11:19.180 --> 3:11:22.140
 That to me is inevitably what happens.

3:11:22.140 --> 3:11:24.220
 And I think this is where the delusion comes in.

3:11:24.220 --> 3:11:30.860
 The idea that when big money is involved and power is involved, remember, again, the same

3:11:30.860 --> 3:11:36.380
 kind of politicians who today get into politics are likely to want to run some of these security

3:11:36.380 --> 3:11:39.100
 agencies because they'll have a lot of power over people.

3:11:39.100 --> 3:11:44.500
 The same kind of maybe sociopaths would be the same skill set, but that's a separate

3:11:44.500 --> 3:11:45.500
 issue.

3:11:45.500 --> 3:11:46.500
 I think it very much is.

3:11:46.500 --> 3:11:50.740
 But you think people, the people in Washington, the same, the CEOs psychologically and skill

3:11:50.740 --> 3:11:51.740
 set wise?

3:11:51.740 --> 3:11:52.740
 Well, today's CEOs?

3:11:52.740 --> 3:11:53.740
 Yes.

3:11:53.740 --> 3:11:54.740
 Okay.

3:11:54.740 --> 3:11:55.740
 Yes.

3:11:55.740 --> 3:11:56.740
 You might be right.

3:11:56.740 --> 3:12:00.400
 Because I think that's what's rewarded for a CEO, somebody who could get along with government.

3:12:00.400 --> 3:12:05.140
 And I think the kind of CEO who is going to run a security company, which is not just

3:12:05.140 --> 3:12:07.660
 about business, it's about the use of force.

3:12:07.660 --> 3:12:08.820
 It's about control.

3:12:08.820 --> 3:12:14.900
 It's about negotiation with other entities that are using force, you know, diplomacy.

3:12:14.900 --> 3:12:19.100
 And we should get back to objective law because I think it's essential to this whole argument.

3:12:19.100 --> 3:12:23.440
 I think all you get into is security agencies fighting security agencies.

3:12:23.440 --> 3:12:24.940
 And again, the biggest gun.

3:12:24.940 --> 3:12:28.940
 And I don't mean here the guy who has the biggest literal gun, the rocket launcher versus

3:12:28.940 --> 3:12:29.940
 the guns.

3:12:29.940 --> 3:12:30.940
 I got excited for a second.

3:12:30.940 --> 3:12:31.940
 By the biggest gun?

3:12:31.940 --> 3:12:32.940
 Yeah.

3:12:32.940 --> 3:12:37.860
 The party that has the more physical force, however, that is mustered either by numbers

3:12:37.860 --> 3:12:41.460
 or by weapons is going to dominate and will take over everybody else.

3:12:41.460 --> 3:12:45.920
 Now, one of the things that's common in a market is takeovers.

3:12:45.920 --> 3:12:47.360
 It's consolidation.

3:12:47.360 --> 3:12:54.180
 And here the consolidation can happen through force and you can rule other security companies.

3:12:54.180 --> 3:12:57.820
 And that's exactly what will happen until you dominate the particular geographic area.

3:12:57.820 --> 3:12:58.820
 Okay.

3:12:58.820 --> 3:13:00.100
 So let me explain why I disagree with that.

3:13:00.100 --> 3:13:04.540
 You were just saying, and I agree correctly, I agree with you, that, listen, if I have

3:13:04.540 --> 3:13:08.020
 access to the bigger gun, why am I paying you or whoever's paying whatever?

3:13:08.020 --> 3:13:10.500
 I'm just going to use force and not pay them.

3:13:10.500 --> 3:13:11.500
 We have that right now.

3:13:11.500 --> 3:13:12.500
 It's called lobbying.

3:13:12.500 --> 3:13:13.500
 Yeah.

3:13:13.500 --> 3:13:18.460
 So instead of me, and I'm sure in your example, you weren't being literal, instead of the

3:13:18.460 --> 3:13:22.820
 insurance company literally having the army, they could be like, hey, let me call corrupt

3:13:22.820 --> 3:13:23.820
 co with a mafia.

3:13:23.820 --> 3:13:24.820
 I agree.

3:13:24.820 --> 3:13:25.820
 Yeah.

3:13:25.820 --> 3:13:26.820
 Go out and take them out.

3:13:26.820 --> 3:13:31.300
 By having this federal government, as you know, and certainly I'm not a fan of, takes

3:13:31.300 --> 3:13:36.680
 more through asset forfeiture than burglaries combined.

3:13:36.680 --> 3:13:38.780
 What asset forfeiture is, people don't even understand this.

3:13:38.780 --> 3:13:43.620
 This is something crazy, which you're on, it's as opposed to me, as opposed as I am,

3:13:43.620 --> 3:13:45.440
 which is I'm a cop.

3:13:45.440 --> 3:13:46.940
 I go to your house.

3:13:46.940 --> 3:13:50.260
 I think you haven't been charged or convicted of anything.

3:13:50.260 --> 3:13:51.260
 I have evidence.

3:13:51.260 --> 3:13:52.260
 It's usually in a car.

3:13:52.260 --> 3:13:53.260
 Yeah.

3:13:53.260 --> 3:13:54.260
 Yeah.

3:13:54.260 --> 3:13:55.260
 It's like drug deals.

3:13:55.260 --> 3:13:56.260
 Okay.

3:13:56.260 --> 3:13:57.260
 I go to your house, you're a drug dealer.

3:13:57.260 --> 3:14:02.780
 I say, and you can understand the reasoning, well, if someone is getting profit through

3:14:02.780 --> 3:14:07.200
 illegal mechanisms, their profit isn't really their property and they shouldn't be rewarded

3:14:07.200 --> 3:14:08.200
 that profit.

3:14:08.200 --> 3:14:12.700
 So basically, I go to your house, you're a drug dealer, I seize all your property.

3:14:12.700 --> 3:14:15.900
 You don't really have recourse, even though you haven't been through deep, I'm just explaining

3:14:15.900 --> 3:14:20.000
 to the audience, through the new process and SOL.

3:14:20.000 --> 3:14:25.200
 That combined, for people who don't know, is more than the total amount of burglaries

3:14:25.200 --> 3:14:26.300
 in America.

3:14:26.300 --> 3:14:27.440
 It's a huge incentive.

3:14:27.440 --> 3:14:30.980
 And what happens is the police department, which seizes your car auctions, it sees your

3:14:30.980 --> 3:14:34.280
 house auctions, it's a great way to line their pockets.

3:14:34.280 --> 3:14:35.280
 This is a huge incentive.

3:14:35.280 --> 3:14:36.640
 It's horrible.

3:14:36.640 --> 3:14:42.920
 It's a huge incentive for police departments to do this because it's like, look, this guy's

3:14:42.920 --> 3:14:43.920
 a crook.

3:14:43.920 --> 3:14:46.680
 Maybe he's not a drug dealer, but he's clearly a pimp.

3:14:46.680 --> 3:14:48.920
 Let me just take all his stuff and it's going to go to the community.

3:14:48.920 --> 3:14:54.500
 Well, and the rationale originally was if I try him, in the meantime, he'll take that

3:14:54.500 --> 3:14:59.440
 money and funnel it somewhere else and hide it, and I'll never be able to get access to

3:14:59.440 --> 3:15:00.440
 it.

3:15:00.440 --> 3:15:06.300
 And it was passed in the 1970s under the original Caesar Laws, what kind of RICO Act, going

3:15:06.300 --> 3:15:07.680
 after the mafia.

3:15:07.680 --> 3:15:12.480
 And one of the reasons I despise Giuliani as much as I do, and there's very few politicians

3:15:12.480 --> 3:15:18.160
 out there that I despise more, is because he was the first guy to use RICO on financiers.

3:15:18.160 --> 3:15:19.760
 And so it wasn't even a drug dealer.

3:15:19.760 --> 3:15:27.640
 It was you accused of a financial fraud, not you weren't shown to be guilty, you were accused.

3:15:27.640 --> 3:15:30.200
 All your assets basically were forfeiture.

3:15:30.200 --> 3:15:31.960
 Innocent until proven guilty went out the window.

3:15:31.960 --> 3:15:34.080
 If you were managing money, you were done.

3:15:34.080 --> 3:15:35.080
 You were finished.

3:15:35.080 --> 3:15:37.280
 So you're saying this kind of stuff naturally emerges with the state.

3:15:37.280 --> 3:15:38.280
 Hold on.

3:15:38.280 --> 3:15:43.080
 So my point is what are presented as the strongest criticism of anarchism are inevitably descriptions

3:15:43.080 --> 3:15:44.380
 of status quo.

3:15:44.380 --> 3:15:46.940
 What you're describing is already the event.

3:15:46.940 --> 3:15:49.120
 I am a big insurance company.

3:15:49.120 --> 3:15:50.720
 I don't want to pay you.

3:15:50.720 --> 3:15:52.420
 I call Washington.

3:15:52.420 --> 3:15:54.700
 Either I pay you and Washington gives me a subsidy.

3:15:54.700 --> 3:15:59.200
 So what you're describing is an inevitable aspect of having a government.

3:15:59.200 --> 3:16:03.440
 So what I'm describing is the inevitable evolution of anarchy into a government.

3:16:03.440 --> 3:16:04.880
 I just think that the...

3:16:04.880 --> 3:16:06.520
 Markets don't consolidate into monopoly.

3:16:06.520 --> 3:16:08.800
 That's a leftist propaganda myth.

3:16:08.800 --> 3:16:13.320
 Not markets where you have substitute products, but this is the problem.

3:16:13.320 --> 3:16:15.660
 The problem is force has no substitute.

3:16:15.660 --> 3:16:18.060
 That is force is not a product you can have.

3:16:18.060 --> 3:16:22.920
 So this is my fundamental issue about turning competing police forces.

3:16:22.920 --> 3:16:23.920
 Force is not a product.

3:16:23.920 --> 3:16:24.920
 Force is not a service.

3:16:24.920 --> 3:16:25.920
 It's a service.

3:16:25.920 --> 3:16:26.920
 It's not a service.

3:16:26.920 --> 3:16:27.920
 And it's not a product.

3:16:27.920 --> 3:16:28.920
 Security is not a service?

3:16:28.920 --> 3:16:29.920
 No.

3:16:29.920 --> 3:16:31.960
 Well, security in the context of a legal system is.

3:16:31.960 --> 3:16:32.960
 But this is the point.

3:16:32.960 --> 3:16:37.680
 The legal system, the laws are not a service or a product.

3:16:37.680 --> 3:16:42.400
 They are a different type of human institution.

3:16:42.400 --> 3:16:44.680
 Science is not a product or a service.

3:16:44.680 --> 3:16:46.400
 It's a different type of human institution.

3:16:46.400 --> 3:16:48.260
 There are different types of human institutions.

3:16:48.260 --> 3:16:49.560
 Some are marketable.

3:16:49.560 --> 3:16:51.920
 You can create markets in, some you cannot.

3:16:51.920 --> 3:16:54.280
 Law is not a marketable system.

3:16:54.280 --> 3:16:55.780
 Can I ask a question quickly?

3:16:55.780 --> 3:16:59.560
 Is there any other field other than law that you think you can't create markets?

3:16:59.560 --> 3:17:00.560
 Well, science.

3:17:00.560 --> 3:17:01.560
 Science is not marketable.

3:17:01.560 --> 3:17:03.160
 The science itself is not marketable.

3:17:03.160 --> 3:17:05.840
 What science is true and the same ethic is in law.

3:17:05.840 --> 3:17:07.120
 Law is not marketable.

3:17:07.120 --> 3:17:10.840
 Law is the system that allows markets to happen.

3:17:10.840 --> 3:17:15.560
 You need a system of law, whether it's private law in a particular narrow context or whether

3:17:15.560 --> 3:17:16.560
 it's broader law.

3:17:16.560 --> 3:17:20.280
 Law is the context in which markets arise.

3:17:20.280 --> 3:17:24.960
 So one of the reasons we transact is we know that there's a certain contract between us,

3:17:24.960 --> 3:17:28.720
 explicit or implicit, that is protected by a certain law, whether it's protected by private

3:17:28.720 --> 3:17:30.680
 agency or private, the government doesn't matter.

3:17:30.680 --> 3:17:34.360
 But there's a certain contract that is protectable, right?

3:17:34.360 --> 3:17:35.360
 By a system.

3:17:35.360 --> 3:17:36.360
 Theoretically.

3:17:36.360 --> 3:17:37.360
 Theoretically.

3:17:37.360 --> 3:17:38.360
 Yes.

3:17:38.360 --> 3:17:40.640
 So law is the context in which markets arise.

3:17:40.640 --> 3:17:47.680
 You don't create a market because there's nothing above it, in a sense.

3:17:47.680 --> 3:17:51.480
 It is the context that allows markets to be created.

3:17:51.480 --> 3:17:54.320
 Once you market it, markets fall apart.

3:17:54.320 --> 3:17:55.320
 So hold on a second.

3:17:55.320 --> 3:17:56.320
 Hold on.

3:17:56.320 --> 3:17:58.980
 So you think that law could be a market?

3:17:58.980 --> 3:18:00.260
 And it already is a market.

3:18:00.260 --> 3:18:02.180
 And we see it, for example, eBay.

3:18:02.180 --> 3:18:05.320
 If I am buying something from Yaron, I won't even know his name.

3:18:05.320 --> 3:18:06.320
 I don't know.

3:18:06.320 --> 3:18:08.200
 Maybe he's in another country.

3:18:08.200 --> 3:18:11.640
 And he screws me out of the money.

3:18:11.640 --> 3:18:12.640
 I can't sue you.

3:18:12.640 --> 3:18:15.240
 Or if I sue you in England, good luck with that.

3:18:15.240 --> 3:18:16.840
 You're not going to argue that I'm going to sue you.

3:18:16.840 --> 3:18:21.360
 What happens in this case, which has already been solved by the market, eBay and PayPal,

3:18:21.360 --> 3:18:24.720
 which has access to your bank account, they act as the private arbiter.

3:18:24.720 --> 3:18:27.000
 They're going to get it wrong a lot.

3:18:27.000 --> 3:18:30.960
 Not even a question, just like Yaron's not going to argue that the government right now

3:18:30.960 --> 3:18:31.960
 gets it wrong a lot.

3:18:31.960 --> 3:18:32.960
 That's not even a question.

3:18:32.960 --> 3:18:38.600
 The point is, at the very least, I'm going to get my resolution faster, cheaper, and

3:18:38.600 --> 3:18:39.880
 more effectively.

3:18:39.880 --> 3:18:44.040
 So the issue with having any kind of government, anything, and Yaron's not going to disagree

3:18:44.040 --> 3:18:50.200
 with this, is at the very least, it's going to be expensive, inefficient, and cause conflict.

3:18:50.200 --> 3:18:53.040
 Yeah, but I think what it allows is exactly...

3:18:53.040 --> 3:18:55.880
 We don't even know what the Supreme Court's going to judge.

3:18:55.880 --> 3:18:59.400
 Again, you're moving us to today's environment, which I'm against.

3:18:59.400 --> 3:19:00.880
 I'm moving us to reality.

3:19:00.880 --> 3:19:03.440
 No, but reality doesn't have to be what it is.

3:19:03.440 --> 3:19:04.440
 I mean, go ahead.

3:19:04.440 --> 3:19:05.920
 That's the most anti Iran quote.

3:19:05.920 --> 3:19:10.280
 No, in a sense of the politics, the political reality.

3:19:10.280 --> 3:19:11.640
 I know, but the quote by itself is great.

3:19:11.640 --> 3:19:12.640
 I know.

3:19:12.640 --> 3:19:13.640
 I know.

3:19:13.640 --> 3:19:14.640
 You'd love to...

3:19:14.640 --> 3:19:15.640
 He agrees with Donald Hoffman is what he said.

3:19:15.640 --> 3:19:16.640
 Yeah, it turns out I agree with Hoffman.

3:19:16.640 --> 3:19:18.200
 He's an elf.

3:19:18.200 --> 3:19:19.200
 So it's...

3:19:19.200 --> 3:19:20.840
 Where were we?

3:19:20.840 --> 3:19:26.400
 So I believe that because we have a certain system of government, it allows for these

3:19:26.400 --> 3:19:32.640
 private innovations to come about that facilitates certain issues in a much more efficient way

3:19:32.640 --> 3:19:34.000
 than the government would deal with it.

3:19:34.000 --> 3:19:40.240
 But it's only because we have a particular system that has defined property rights, that

3:19:40.240 --> 3:19:45.640
 has a clear view of what property rights are, it has a clear view of what a transaction

3:19:45.640 --> 3:19:51.080
 mean or what contract law is, and eBay has a bunch of stuff that you sign, whether you

3:19:51.080 --> 3:19:52.080
 read it or not.

3:19:52.080 --> 3:19:53.080
 Of course.

3:19:53.080 --> 3:20:00.120
 The fact is defined first, and then there are massive innovations at the level of particular

3:20:00.120 --> 3:20:05.320
 transactions at the level of an eBay that facilitate increased efficiency.

3:20:05.320 --> 3:20:06.320
 And that's great.

3:20:06.320 --> 3:20:08.560
 But the fact is none of that gets developed.

3:20:08.560 --> 3:20:10.180
 None of that gets created.

3:20:10.180 --> 3:20:14.680
 In a world in which I might be living under different definition of property rights, eBay

3:20:14.680 --> 3:20:16.760
 might be living under separate definition of property rights.

3:20:16.760 --> 3:20:20.800
 You might have a third definition of property rights, and there's no mechanism by which

3:20:20.800 --> 3:20:24.920
 we can actually operationalize that because we all have a different system.

3:20:24.920 --> 3:20:25.920
 There is a mechanism.

3:20:25.920 --> 3:20:27.000
 We already have that.

3:20:27.000 --> 3:20:28.880
 Let's change the example I just used.

3:20:28.880 --> 3:20:34.240
 What happens if a Chinese person who has different definition of property rights kills an American

3:20:34.240 --> 3:20:35.240
 in Brazil?

3:20:35.240 --> 3:20:39.920
 Again, in a smaller community, what happens is lots of violence.

3:20:39.920 --> 3:20:41.800
 No, but I'm talking right now.

3:20:41.800 --> 3:20:42.960
 A Chinese person has...

3:20:42.960 --> 3:20:47.200
 Right now, the only reason that it doesn't lead to violence is because people are afraid

3:20:47.200 --> 3:20:52.200
 of even more violence, and it affects many people, large numbers of people who don't

3:20:52.200 --> 3:20:53.400
 want to go to war.

3:20:53.400 --> 3:20:56.860
 But if you have small...

3:20:56.860 --> 3:21:01.720
 In a state where the states were small, in those little states, there was war all the

3:21:01.720 --> 3:21:08.640
 time for exactly those reasons, because the cost was lower, because it was more personal,

3:21:08.640 --> 3:21:13.000
 because I knew maybe the person who was killed over there, and I went to my king and encouraged

3:21:13.000 --> 3:21:14.000
 him to go to war.

3:21:14.000 --> 3:21:15.000
 You know why there was war?

3:21:15.000 --> 3:21:16.000
 Violence is constant.

3:21:16.000 --> 3:21:17.040
 You know why there was war?

3:21:17.040 --> 3:21:23.520
 Because there had been no Ayn Rand, and good ideas lead to good societies, which leads

3:21:23.520 --> 3:21:26.960
 to good people, which leads to good behavior, good interrelationships.

3:21:26.960 --> 3:21:31.400
 So now that we have Ayn Rand, all this stuff in the past is irrelevant, because if they

3:21:31.400 --> 3:21:33.800
 studied her works, we would be...

3:21:33.800 --> 3:21:39.720
 Rand was on Donahue again, you could watch the clip, and he asks her, she goes...

3:21:39.720 --> 3:21:44.640
 He goes, you're saying that if we were more selfish and acted more self interest, there'd

3:21:44.640 --> 3:21:46.880
 be less war, less Hitler?

3:21:46.880 --> 3:21:48.920
 And she said, there wouldn't be any.

3:21:48.920 --> 3:21:49.920
 Right?

3:21:49.920 --> 3:21:50.920
 That's right.

3:21:50.920 --> 3:21:53.560
 Well, if we were all selfish, there wouldn't be any Hitlers, right?

3:21:53.560 --> 3:22:00.960
 But who do you regard as the overweening authority if I am buying a product from you as someone

3:22:00.960 --> 3:22:02.680
 in England via eBay?

3:22:02.680 --> 3:22:05.200
 Who's the governing authority?

3:22:05.200 --> 3:22:10.000
 The governing authority are the legal systems in England and the United States, which have

3:22:10.000 --> 3:22:11.800
 to be synchronized pretty well.

3:22:11.800 --> 3:22:12.800
 Right.

3:22:12.800 --> 3:22:17.160
 So why eBay doesn't function in certain countries, because there is no legal system.

3:22:17.160 --> 3:22:18.160
 I agree with you.

3:22:18.160 --> 3:22:22.840
 My point is, why do those legal systems have to be a function specifically of geography,

3:22:22.840 --> 3:22:25.840
 as opposed to, why can't I sitting here...

3:22:25.840 --> 3:22:27.880
 I could sit here, you're not going to let me finish my point.

3:22:27.880 --> 3:22:31.740
 I can sit here and be a British diplomat, right?

3:22:31.740 --> 3:22:35.560
 And as a British diplomat, I'm going to be treated differently under American law than

3:22:35.560 --> 3:22:37.680
 you are as an American citizen as you are.

3:22:37.680 --> 3:22:43.360
 Why can't you have that same process, sure, we're geographically proximate, but I'm a

3:22:43.360 --> 3:22:47.240
 citizen of this company and you're a citizen of that company?

3:22:47.240 --> 3:22:49.960
 Why would that be different in your opinion?

3:22:49.960 --> 3:22:55.440
 If it's England and the United States, it's probably not going to matter that much, right?

3:22:55.440 --> 3:23:00.740
 But if it's Iran and the United States, then the fact that we're sitting next to each other

3:23:00.740 --> 3:23:01.740
 makes a huge difference.

3:23:01.740 --> 3:23:02.740
 Oh, I...

3:23:02.740 --> 3:23:03.740
 Massive difference.

3:23:03.740 --> 3:23:08.120
 The fact is that, and Ayn Rand, I think would be the first technologist and this is why

3:23:08.120 --> 3:23:10.720
 she was so opposed to anarchy.

3:23:10.720 --> 3:23:11.720
 It's not...

3:23:11.720 --> 3:23:12.720
 That's not why.

3:23:12.720 --> 3:23:13.720
 It is why.

3:23:13.720 --> 3:23:14.720
 It's because of Rothbard.

3:23:14.720 --> 3:23:15.720
 No, it has nothing to do with...

3:23:15.720 --> 3:23:16.720
 Nothing?

3:23:16.720 --> 3:23:17.720
 It has nothing to do with Rothbard.

3:23:17.720 --> 3:23:18.720
 Nothing.

3:23:18.720 --> 3:23:19.720
 Nothing.

3:23:19.720 --> 3:23:20.720
 How do you know?

3:23:20.720 --> 3:23:21.720
 Nothing.

3:23:21.720 --> 3:23:22.720
 How would you know?

3:23:22.720 --> 3:23:23.720
 Because her argument against anarchy is an intellectual one, not a personality based

3:23:23.720 --> 3:23:24.720
 one.

3:23:24.720 --> 3:23:25.720
 Can't it be both?

3:23:25.720 --> 3:23:26.720
 Anyway, but back to it, back to Iran.

3:23:26.720 --> 3:23:27.720
 No, it has nothing to do with Rothbard.

3:23:27.720 --> 3:23:33.200
 You don't know that, you're not a psychic or a necromancer.

3:23:33.200 --> 3:23:36.500
 The only way we're going to resolve this is arm wrestling, right?

3:23:36.500 --> 3:23:37.500
 It's through violence.

3:23:37.500 --> 3:23:40.160
 Arm wrestling is not violence.

3:23:40.160 --> 3:23:41.160
 Words are violence.

3:23:41.160 --> 3:23:42.160
 Words are violence, everyone.

3:23:42.160 --> 3:23:43.160
 Words are violence.

3:23:43.160 --> 3:23:44.160
 Emotions are violence.

3:23:44.160 --> 3:23:48.600
 He throws me off with this stuff.

3:23:48.600 --> 3:23:49.600
 That's the problem.

3:23:49.600 --> 3:23:50.600
 Even facts and truth?

3:23:50.600 --> 3:23:51.600
 He's very, very good.

3:23:51.600 --> 3:23:52.600
 Not facts and truth.

3:23:52.600 --> 3:23:56.400
 Distortions and arbitrary statements, because your statement about Rothbard is an arbitrary

3:23:56.400 --> 3:24:01.040
 statement that has no cognitive standing and therefore I can dismiss it.

3:24:01.040 --> 3:24:03.280
 I'm not doing like this because I want to dismiss it.

3:24:03.280 --> 3:24:04.280
 It has no cognitive status.

3:24:04.280 --> 3:24:09.120
 The fact that she disliked Rothbard doesn't mean that everything he said she was going

3:24:09.120 --> 3:24:10.280
 to dismiss because she disliked it.

3:24:10.280 --> 3:24:11.280
 I agree with you.

3:24:11.280 --> 3:24:13.280
 But what I'm saying is it would not be impossible.

3:24:13.280 --> 3:24:14.280
 But there's no evidence.

3:24:14.280 --> 3:24:15.280
 I'll talk.

3:24:15.280 --> 3:24:16.880
 I'll give you some evidence.

3:24:16.880 --> 3:24:18.260
 Human psychology.

3:24:18.260 --> 3:24:23.520
 It is not impossible that if you hate some... What's that guy's name?

3:24:23.520 --> 3:24:24.520
 Richard Wolff.

3:24:24.520 --> 3:24:25.520
 Right.

3:24:25.520 --> 3:24:29.680
 It's not impossible that if Richard Wolff said something that you would otherwise agree

3:24:29.680 --> 3:24:34.520
 with, hold on, let me finish, you'd be dismissive or less likely to give him credit for it being

3:24:34.520 --> 3:24:35.520
 a human being.

3:24:35.520 --> 3:24:36.520
 That's all I'm saying.

3:24:36.520 --> 3:24:41.840
 It's as silly as to say Rothbard came up with this theory of anarchy because he was pissed

3:24:41.840 --> 3:24:43.880
 off at Ayn Rand and wanted to write something.

3:24:43.880 --> 3:24:44.880
 I don't know.

3:24:44.880 --> 3:24:45.880
 Bring it down.

3:24:45.880 --> 3:24:50.960
 Bring it down so that he can speak too and let's keep it...

3:24:50.960 --> 3:24:51.960
 I don't think we're getting agitated.

3:24:51.960 --> 3:24:52.960
 No, you guys aren't.

3:24:52.960 --> 3:24:53.960
 No, no, no.

3:24:53.960 --> 3:24:54.960
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3:24:54.960 --> 3:25:02.920
 No, bring it down not in terms of give more pauses so Michael can insert himself.

3:25:02.920 --> 3:25:03.920
 That's what I mean.

3:25:03.920 --> 3:25:04.920
 See, private governance.

3:25:04.920 --> 3:25:05.920
 What's the point of that?

3:25:05.920 --> 3:25:06.920
 Private governance.

3:25:06.920 --> 3:25:07.920
 Look.

3:25:07.920 --> 3:25:08.920
 Look, it's private governance.

3:25:08.920 --> 3:25:09.920
 I'm all for private governance.

3:25:09.920 --> 3:25:12.320
 I'm trying to establish this geographic law of the land.

3:25:12.320 --> 3:25:13.320
 I don't know.

3:25:13.320 --> 3:25:14.320
 That's not the point.

3:25:14.320 --> 3:25:17.440
 I do think that Michael's... I mean, that's interesting that you disagree with this.

3:25:17.440 --> 3:25:23.680
 I do believe that psychology has an impact on ideas and Ayn Rand, you don't think Ayn

3:25:23.680 --> 3:25:30.400
 Rand had grudges that impacted the way she saw the world?

3:25:30.400 --> 3:25:31.640
 We would like to think that...

3:25:31.640 --> 3:25:35.200
 I don't think any of her grudges entered into her philosophical statements, at least not

3:25:35.200 --> 3:25:43.640
 that I can tell, and given the centrality Ayn Rand gave to the role of government, to

3:25:43.640 --> 3:25:48.720
 the existence of government, to the need for government, to establish real freedom, and

3:25:48.720 --> 3:25:53.000
 the way she defines freedom, which is very different than Rothbard, and the way she defines

3:25:53.000 --> 3:26:00.480
 it, to say then that her opposition and anarchy is because of, I think, is just an arbitrary

3:26:00.480 --> 3:26:01.480
 statement.

3:26:01.480 --> 3:26:02.480
 I didn't say because of.

3:26:02.480 --> 3:26:03.480
 I didn't say because of.

3:26:03.480 --> 3:26:04.480
 I said followed by.

3:26:04.480 --> 3:26:07.360
 And not, and I don't see why psychology would enter it.

3:26:07.360 --> 3:26:11.320
 Now, maybe the tone in which you responded to an answer might have been motivated by

3:26:11.320 --> 3:26:14.360
 that or something like that, but given the amount of thought she gave to the role of

3:26:14.360 --> 3:26:19.480
 government in human society and why government was needed, and why you needed laws in order

3:26:19.480 --> 3:26:27.840
 to be free, that freedom didn't proceed, you needed the right hierarchy, I think that we

3:26:27.840 --> 3:26:35.240
 could say that it, give it at least a respect that she might have been wrong, but she had

3:26:35.240 --> 3:26:39.440
 a particular theory that rejected anarchy, and that thought anarchy was wrong.

3:26:39.440 --> 3:26:40.440
 Okay, hold on.

3:26:40.440 --> 3:26:45.640
 I really resent, and I don't want to say you're doing this, the implication that if Rand was

3:26:45.640 --> 3:26:49.680
 guided by her passions, that somehow is a criticism of her or lessens her.

3:26:49.680 --> 3:26:52.120
 I think Rand was a very passionate person.

3:26:52.120 --> 3:26:56.920
 I think she loved her husband enormously.

3:26:56.920 --> 3:27:02.280
 She despised certain people enormously, and I don't think that there's anything wrong

3:27:02.280 --> 3:27:03.280
 with that.

3:27:03.280 --> 3:27:05.840
 I don't think she would change her philosophical position about something because she disliked

3:27:05.840 --> 3:27:06.840
 somebody.

3:27:06.840 --> 3:27:07.840
 I agree, but what I'm saying.

3:27:07.840 --> 3:27:09.480
 Given the amount of thought she gave to that philosophical position.

3:27:09.480 --> 3:27:16.300
 All I'm saying is, it is possible that if someone comes across ideas that she had not

3:27:16.300 --> 3:27:22.280
 considered before, if she regarded this person as a bad actor, like all of us, she would

3:27:22.280 --> 3:27:25.160
 be less likely to take them under consideration.

3:27:25.160 --> 3:27:26.160
 Sure.

3:27:26.160 --> 3:27:27.160
 That's all I'm saying.

3:27:27.160 --> 3:27:28.160
 Sure.

3:27:28.160 --> 3:27:31.080
 And I think other people confronted her with ideas of anarchy, I don't think Rothbard was

3:27:31.080 --> 3:27:32.080
 the only one.

3:27:32.080 --> 3:27:33.080
 Correct, Roy Charles as well, yeah.

3:27:33.080 --> 3:27:34.080
 Roy Charles certainly did.

3:27:34.080 --> 3:27:37.940
 And she rejected them, and she rejected them because she had, and whether you agree with

3:27:37.940 --> 3:27:45.960
 or not, she had a thought out position about why you needed to have this particular structure

3:27:45.960 --> 3:27:49.840
 in place so that markets and human freedom could exist.

3:27:49.840 --> 3:27:54.520
 It's just really interesting because this is the one time, in my view, and please correct

3:27:54.520 --> 3:28:01.120
 me if I'm wrong, where she invokes need as kind of a basis for political activity.

3:28:01.120 --> 3:28:05.360
 So let's suppose you want this federal government, whatever you want, you don't want it like

3:28:05.360 --> 3:28:11.560
 it is now, like your version of the government, I don't see why it's an issue for you for

3:28:11.560 --> 3:28:18.240
 me and Lex to say, we're not privy to Washington, we're going to do our own thing, and given,

3:28:18.240 --> 3:28:23.360
 if we go about our lives not initiating force and being productive actors, why she would

3:28:23.360 --> 3:28:24.360
 have an issue with this.

3:28:24.360 --> 3:28:25.360
 Why would I care?

3:28:25.360 --> 3:28:28.900
 Well, you would care because if you're saying the government has a monopoly on force between

3:28:28.900 --> 3:28:29.900
 these two oceans.

3:28:29.900 --> 3:28:32.640
 So you can do that as long as you don't violate somebody else's rights.

3:28:32.640 --> 3:28:36.120
 Sure, but what I'm saying is we just declare ourselves sovereign, we're not going to pay

3:28:36.120 --> 3:28:42.600
 any income taxes, we're going to be peaceful people, and when Lex and I have disputes,

3:28:42.600 --> 3:28:46.160
 we're going to call Joe, that's Joe Rogan, you're never going to get to meet him, but

3:28:46.160 --> 3:28:47.160
 he's a good guy.

3:28:47.160 --> 3:28:48.160
 I know.

3:28:48.160 --> 3:28:51.000
 We're going to call Joe, and Joe's going to resolve it.

3:28:51.000 --> 3:28:57.240
 He's so good at like, you know, needling and getting you off topic that way.

3:28:57.240 --> 3:29:00.560
 He's really effective at it.

3:29:00.560 --> 3:29:04.840
 I always say, when I debate communists, I always say to them...

3:29:04.840 --> 3:29:05.840
 You mean Lex?

3:29:05.840 --> 3:29:07.200
 Yeah, maybe Lex.

3:29:07.200 --> 3:29:08.200
 Maybe I should...

3:29:08.200 --> 3:29:10.000
 Comrade, I love you.

3:29:10.000 --> 3:29:11.000
 That if they really believe...

3:29:11.000 --> 3:29:12.000
 Burgundy, not red.

3:29:12.000 --> 3:29:15.840
 If they really believe in what they think, then they should be advocates of capitalism,

3:29:15.840 --> 3:29:19.860
 because under capitalism, under my system of government, capitalist government, right,

3:29:19.860 --> 3:29:23.920
 they could go and start a commune, they can live with communists, they can live to each

3:29:23.920 --> 3:29:29.840
 according to his needs, from each according to his ability, all they want, and live their

3:29:29.840 --> 3:29:34.080
 pathetic miserable lives that way, and the government would never intervene, because

3:29:34.080 --> 3:29:38.760
 the whole view of capitalism is freedom, is we leave it alone, right?

3:29:38.760 --> 3:29:42.060
 As long as you're not violating my rights, as long as you're not taking my property,

3:29:42.060 --> 3:29:45.120
 as long as you're not engaging with...

3:29:45.120 --> 3:29:49.440
 So in that sense, yeah, you and Lex can form your own thing, I don't believe in compulsory

3:29:49.440 --> 3:29:55.280
 taxes anyway, so you and Lex can do your own thing, never pay taxes, as long as you're

3:29:55.280 --> 3:29:59.120
 not violating the laws, and the laws are very limited, right, because they're only there

3:29:59.120 --> 3:30:02.080
 to protect individual rights, so as long as you're not violating somebody else's property

3:30:02.080 --> 3:30:07.360
 rights or inflicting force on anybody else, you're peaceful, you can do what you want,

3:30:07.360 --> 3:30:08.360
 you know, don't have...

3:30:08.360 --> 3:30:09.360
 Great.

3:30:09.360 --> 3:30:10.360
 Yeah.

3:30:10.360 --> 3:30:11.360
 Great.

3:30:11.360 --> 3:30:12.360
 Case placed.

3:30:12.360 --> 3:30:13.360
 Don't have sex with kids, right?

3:30:13.360 --> 3:30:14.360
 I will stop immediately.

3:30:14.360 --> 3:30:15.360
 Good.

3:30:15.360 --> 3:30:16.360
 The rest of us are just playing checkers and he's playing chess.

3:30:16.360 --> 3:30:20.320
 Yeah, I mean, a government that protects individual rights properly is a government

3:30:20.320 --> 3:30:23.640
 that leaves you alone to live your life as you see fit, even if you live your life in

3:30:23.640 --> 3:30:27.280
 a way that I don't approve of, that I don't think is right, I mean, that's the whole point,

3:30:27.280 --> 3:30:28.280
 right?

3:30:28.280 --> 3:30:35.280
 So the only thing you can do is, you know, try to enforce arbitrary laws that you come

3:30:35.280 --> 3:30:36.280
 up with on me.

3:30:36.280 --> 3:30:37.280
 Sure.

3:30:37.280 --> 3:30:38.280
 Of course.

3:30:38.280 --> 3:30:39.280
 Absolutely.

3:30:39.280 --> 3:30:40.280
 Okay, great.

3:30:40.280 --> 3:30:45.240
 Wouldn't it be wonderful if we lived in a world where rights protecting laws are superfluous,

3:30:45.240 --> 3:30:52.480
 but the reality is usually that somebody violates them, whether by accident or intentionally,

3:30:52.480 --> 3:30:57.400
 and that you need some mechanism, now if you guys can resolve that dispute without getting

3:30:57.400 --> 3:30:58.860
 involved, fine.

3:30:58.860 --> 3:31:04.760
 But if you guys land up not resolving, there is another authority that will help you resolve

3:31:04.760 --> 3:31:05.760
 it.

3:31:05.760 --> 3:31:06.760
 Yeah, our company.

3:31:06.760 --> 3:31:07.760
 So can I ask you a question?

3:31:07.760 --> 3:31:12.960
 Under anarchism, what kind of systems of laws do you think will emerge?

3:31:12.960 --> 3:31:18.200
 Do you think we'll have basically a similar kind of layer of universal law to where, like...

3:31:18.200 --> 3:31:19.200
 Let me answer this.

3:31:19.200 --> 3:31:20.200
 This is a great question.

3:31:20.200 --> 3:31:21.900
 I know what you're going with this.

3:31:21.900 --> 3:31:26.340
 This is often presented as a criticism of anarchism, and this is actually something

3:31:26.340 --> 3:31:30.240
 I think Yaron would agree with as well in other contexts, which is this.

3:31:30.240 --> 3:31:34.600
 One of the reasons communism can't work, central planning can't work, and this was one of Mises's

3:31:34.600 --> 3:31:40.020
 great innovations, is if I could sit down, it's like asking, what would the fashion industry

3:31:40.020 --> 3:31:42.540
 look like if the government didn't run it?

3:31:42.540 --> 3:31:44.040
 There's no way for me to know.

3:31:44.040 --> 3:31:48.240
 What the fashion industry is, which all of us are in favor of it being free, is literally

3:31:48.240 --> 3:31:55.640
 millions of designers, of seamstresses, of people who make the fabric, also references

3:31:55.640 --> 3:32:01.920
 throughout history, and these creative artistic minds putting things together in every year.

3:32:01.920 --> 3:32:03.440
 There's no shortage of clothes.

3:32:03.440 --> 3:32:08.840
 In fact, we make so many clothes that we send them in landfill sizes to overseas poor countries,

3:32:08.840 --> 3:32:11.600
 and you have people in these destitute countries wearing Adidas shirts.

3:32:11.600 --> 3:32:15.260
 They can't even read English, but because we don't know what to do with all these clothes.

3:32:15.260 --> 3:32:18.360
 That's how the glory of free enterprise is.

3:32:18.360 --> 3:32:23.960
 The problem is, problem using this loosely, everything comes cheap and overabundant, like

3:32:23.960 --> 3:32:24.960
 food.

3:32:24.960 --> 3:32:28.320
 Well, it doesn't actually come overabundant, but it's done properly.

3:32:28.320 --> 3:32:29.320
 That's fair.

3:32:29.320 --> 3:32:30.320
 Supply meets demand.

3:32:30.320 --> 3:32:31.320
 Sure.

3:32:31.320 --> 3:32:32.320
 That's fair.

3:32:32.320 --> 3:32:34.680
 What I'm saying is, if 150 years ago you said, you know, one day we're going to have an issue

3:32:34.680 --> 3:32:38.720
 where there's going to be so much food and then the kids are too fat.

3:32:38.720 --> 3:32:42.360
 It's just going to be like, I have four who are dead in the crib.

3:32:42.360 --> 3:32:43.360
 I wish.

3:32:43.360 --> 3:32:47.240
 I mean, what kind of paradise is this?

3:32:47.240 --> 3:32:52.160
 What you would have, we have this right now in certain senses, you have the Hasidim, you

3:32:52.160 --> 3:32:58.000
 have Sharia, I'm sure in the medical system, they have their own kind of private courts

3:32:58.000 --> 3:33:01.520
 and court marshals is another example of this, although obviously that's through the state.

3:33:01.520 --> 3:33:07.840
 So you would have innovation in law, under markets, just the same ways you'd have it.

3:33:07.840 --> 3:33:09.380
 And we have this already.

3:33:09.380 --> 3:33:13.600
 Maybe it's not, Yaron doesn't like in terms of murder and rape and I can understand why,

3:33:13.600 --> 3:33:18.960
 but in terms of business and interactions, he would have no problem with different arbitration

3:33:18.960 --> 3:33:22.800
 firms, having different rules for what kind of evidence is allowed.

3:33:22.800 --> 3:33:25.920
 Maybe you only have 60 days to make your case and so on and so forth.

3:33:25.920 --> 3:33:30.120
 And the market is a process of creative innovation and it would be dynamic.

3:33:30.120 --> 3:33:31.120
 It would be changing.

3:33:31.120 --> 3:33:35.500
 So what's interesting relating to this is that one of the ways Ayn Rand proposed raising

3:33:35.500 --> 3:33:41.160
 revenue for the government, because she was against, was let's say we have a contract.

3:33:41.160 --> 3:33:47.200
 We could just have it arbitrated without government interfering, but if we wanted to access the

3:33:47.200 --> 3:33:51.320
 courts of the government as a final authority, we would pay.

3:33:51.320 --> 3:33:55.620
 And that's how governments would raise, some of the funds would be raised that way.

3:33:55.620 --> 3:34:02.040
 So there's definitely a value to having this innovation and the public space.

3:34:02.040 --> 3:34:04.680
 But I don't believe that is the case with murder.

3:34:04.680 --> 3:34:07.120
 I don't believe that is the case with violent crime.

3:34:07.120 --> 3:34:10.560
 And it's funny you bring up Sharia because David Friedman, when he gives, when he gives

3:34:10.560 --> 3:34:12.120
 Wait, I got to ask you to clarify.

3:34:12.120 --> 3:34:13.120
 I'm not trying to interrupt you.

3:34:13.120 --> 3:34:14.360
 You were talking about with murder.

3:34:14.360 --> 3:34:19.720
 I mean, you would agree, I think just to clarify for the audience, that there is room for innovation

3:34:19.720 --> 3:34:21.240
 and murder because there's things like matter of slaughter.

3:34:21.240 --> 3:34:22.240
 There's murder one, murder two.

3:34:22.240 --> 3:34:23.240
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

3:34:23.240 --> 3:34:26.080
 I don't think it happens at a market level.

3:34:26.080 --> 3:34:28.760
 I don't think there's a market innovation for murder.

3:34:28.760 --> 3:34:32.520
 Somebody has to figure out what those standards are and they will evolve as we gain more knowledge.

3:34:32.520 --> 3:34:36.360
 But we're all in agreement that the word murder means very different things.

3:34:36.360 --> 3:34:37.360
 Oh, absolutely.

3:34:37.360 --> 3:34:43.120
 And if circumstances matter and standards of proof and standards of evidence, all of

3:34:43.120 --> 3:34:45.120
 that, there has to be a standard.

3:34:45.120 --> 3:34:46.640
 All of that, there has to be a standard.

3:34:46.640 --> 3:34:52.160
 And that's what I think a proper government provides.

3:34:52.160 --> 3:34:59.160
 So David Friedman uses, in some of his talks about private law, he uses Sharia law in Somalia

3:34:59.160 --> 3:35:00.160
 as an example.

3:35:00.160 --> 3:35:07.040
 Look, legal systems evolve privately, independent, yeah, authoritarian ones, ones that don't

3:35:07.040 --> 3:35:08.840
 respect the rights of women at all.

3:35:08.840 --> 3:35:09.840
 Are you married?

3:35:09.840 --> 3:35:10.840
 No, no.

3:35:10.840 --> 3:35:14.240
 But we all want to have sex with our mother, as Freud would say.

3:35:14.240 --> 3:35:15.240
 Oh my God.

3:35:15.240 --> 3:35:16.720
 Can we make that a clip?

3:35:16.720 --> 3:35:17.720
 Yeah.

3:35:17.720 --> 3:35:20.360
 Where the hell did that come from?

3:35:20.360 --> 3:35:23.040
 That's much better than what I was just saying about the kids.

3:35:23.040 --> 3:35:24.040
 I appreciate that.

3:35:24.040 --> 3:35:25.040
 Okay.

3:35:25.040 --> 3:35:29.880
 So we went in a voluntary way, although sometimes for Yaron and sometimes for Michael it felt

3:35:29.880 --> 3:35:34.400
 involuntary, but we all got the big guns.

3:35:34.400 --> 3:35:37.600
 So how do we land this?

3:35:37.600 --> 3:35:41.480
 Obviously there's a disagreement about anarchism here.

3:35:41.480 --> 3:35:44.000
 I think there's a big agreement.

3:35:44.000 --> 3:35:48.720
 Because if Yaron was saying that if I want to have my voluntary stupid thing with you,

3:35:48.720 --> 3:35:53.080
 and his government is not going to tax me, and is not going to insinuate itself unless

3:35:53.080 --> 3:35:56.000
 we're murdering each other, something like that, I'm okay with that.

3:35:56.000 --> 3:35:59.800
 So if you take the example of Sharia law, which was mentioned earlier.

3:35:59.800 --> 3:36:06.080
 So if you have a little community within this, within my world, right, that imposes Sharia

3:36:06.080 --> 3:36:15.440
 law, if it starts mutilating little girls, then you impose your law on it, right?

3:36:15.440 --> 3:36:18.640
 You impose the law on it because it's an issue of protecting individual rights.

3:36:18.640 --> 3:36:24.000
 If they want to treat women, if women have to cover up, and the women are okay with that,

3:36:24.000 --> 3:36:25.000
 that's fine.

3:36:25.000 --> 3:36:29.380
 If the woman wants to leave but is not allowed to leave, that's where my government would

3:36:29.380 --> 3:36:35.680
 step in and prevent them from using force against her.

3:36:35.680 --> 3:36:37.640
 And that's it, right?

3:36:37.640 --> 3:36:39.920
 Now I think it's more complicated than that, right?

3:36:39.920 --> 3:36:44.760
 Because I think there are complex issue property rights often where it's not going to be easy

3:36:44.760 --> 3:36:48.600
 for you guys to resolve, and particularly if you interact with people outside of your

3:36:48.600 --> 3:36:49.600
 community.

3:36:49.600 --> 3:36:50.600
 Sure.

3:36:50.600 --> 3:36:56.120
 But yeah, my view is government is there to protect individual rights.

3:36:56.120 --> 3:36:57.120
 That's it.

3:36:57.120 --> 3:36:58.340
 Otherwise, leave you alone.

3:36:58.340 --> 3:37:02.440
 I think this conversation is going to continue for quite a while.

3:37:02.440 --> 3:37:06.680
 Israel has a new book on the topic coming out eventually, one day.

3:37:06.680 --> 3:37:09.800
 So you're working also on the, still called the White Pill?

3:37:09.800 --> 3:37:10.800
 The White Pill, yeah.

3:37:10.800 --> 3:37:16.920
 And the first line of the White Pill is, Ayn Rand did not laugh.

3:37:16.920 --> 3:37:17.920
 I'm not joking.

3:37:17.920 --> 3:37:18.920
 That's literally the first line.

3:37:18.920 --> 3:37:19.920
 I believe it.

3:37:19.920 --> 3:37:23.160
 Because it opens up with her, who knows what the book's going to look like when it's done,

3:37:23.160 --> 3:37:27.760
 but as of now, that's the beginning, because it opens up with her testimony at the House

3:37:27.760 --> 3:37:33.560
 UnAmerican Activities Committee, where she's trying to explain to these congresspeople

3:37:33.560 --> 3:37:38.760
 what it was like when she left the Soviet Union, and they are just befuddled by it.

3:37:38.760 --> 3:37:40.280
 Can you explain she did not laugh?

3:37:40.280 --> 3:37:43.960
 Well, because the first line of the Fountainhead, spoiler alert, is Howard Rourke laughed.

3:37:43.960 --> 3:37:45.560
 So this is a little inversion of that.

3:37:45.560 --> 3:37:53.900
 It says Ayn Rand did not laugh, because Ayn Rand was a huge fan of America, as am I.

3:37:53.900 --> 3:37:57.520
 She took our political system very seriously.

3:37:57.520 --> 3:38:00.160
 She had enormous reverence for institutions.

3:38:00.160 --> 3:38:06.720
 One example of this is one of the villains of the Atlas Shrugged is based on Harry Truman.

3:38:06.720 --> 3:38:08.880
 I think Thompson is the character's name.

3:38:08.880 --> 3:38:13.600
 And because she had such respect for the title of president, she refers to him as the chairman.

3:38:13.600 --> 3:38:14.600
 She couldn't even bring herself...

3:38:14.600 --> 3:38:17.160
 She had a huge respect for the presidency.

3:38:17.160 --> 3:38:20.840
 I wonder if she'd still have it, given the last string of presidents we've had.

3:38:20.840 --> 3:38:27.360
 So having her, which sets up the broader point of the book, which I'm sure I'll be back on

3:38:27.360 --> 3:38:32.160
 the show to discuss, assuming this bridge hasn't been burned, but I'll try my best.

3:38:32.160 --> 3:38:34.480
 All three of us are canceled.

3:38:34.480 --> 3:38:36.160
 Some are more canceled than the others.

3:38:36.160 --> 3:38:37.160
 Uh oh.

3:38:37.160 --> 3:38:38.160
 I don't know.

3:38:38.160 --> 3:38:39.160
 I'm looking at you, Michael.

3:38:39.160 --> 3:38:45.960
 And the point being, which sets up the broader point of the book, is how ignorant many people

3:38:45.960 --> 3:38:53.280
 are in the West about the horrors of Stalinism and communism, but also how many people in

3:38:53.280 --> 3:39:02.320
 the West were complicit in saying to Americans, go home, everything's fine, this is great,

3:39:02.320 --> 3:39:05.920
 sure, you know, this is why pensions have a race, they're sure they're mistakes.

3:39:05.920 --> 3:39:13.600
 And they really made a point to downplay really gratuitously some of the unimaginable atrocities

3:39:13.600 --> 3:39:15.280
 of the communism.

3:39:15.280 --> 3:39:20.880
 And just one more sentence, and going through the work and learning about what they actually

3:39:20.880 --> 3:39:28.400
 did is so jaw dropping that it's, and if I didn't know about it, many people I'm friends

3:39:28.400 --> 3:39:32.320
 with who are historians who entered the space, you know, this isn't common knowledge to them,

3:39:32.320 --> 3:39:35.200
 then we can assume that almost no one knows about it.

3:39:35.200 --> 3:39:40.760
 And I think it's very important for people to appreciate whether Republican, Democrat,

3:39:40.760 --> 3:39:45.160
 liberal, whatever, how much of a danger this is.

3:39:45.160 --> 3:39:49.400
 And I think Americans have this, there's a book called It Can't Happen Here, I think

3:39:49.400 --> 3:39:53.280
 by Sinclair Lewis about a fascism coming to America.

3:39:53.280 --> 3:39:57.600
 American exceptionalism has a positive context, but also a negative context where you think

3:39:57.600 --> 3:40:01.020
 we're invincible, all these horrible things that happen in these other countries, it can't

3:40:01.020 --> 3:40:06.440
 possibly happen here, we're America, we're special, and it's completely an absurdity.

3:40:06.440 --> 3:40:07.440
 Yeah.

3:40:07.440 --> 3:40:10.040
 Have you seen the movie, Mr. Jones?

3:40:10.040 --> 3:40:15.680
 My friend wrote it, no I haven't, but Walter Durante and his quotes, I have a thread on

3:40:15.680 --> 3:40:16.680
 Twitter.

3:40:16.680 --> 3:40:22.560
 For those who don't know, he won a Pulitzer because he was the New York Times man in Moscow.

3:40:22.560 --> 3:40:29.960
 And endlessly, he was talking about how great it was, how if you hear about this famine

3:40:29.960 --> 3:40:35.140
 in Ukraine, this is just propaganda, I went to the villages, you know, everyone's happy

3:40:35.140 --> 3:40:36.360
 and fed.

3:40:36.360 --> 3:40:42.160
 A lot of it was explicit lies, you know, and when you realize you're talking about, let's

3:40:42.160 --> 3:40:49.440
 give them the absolute benefit of the doubt, an accidental genocide, it's still mind boggling.

3:40:49.440 --> 3:40:54.160
 And also, you know, Ann Applebaum, who's just a phenomenal, phenomenal writer, she wrote

3:40:54.160 --> 3:40:59.680
 a book called Red Famine, Stalin's War in Ukraine, and she talks about how what people

3:40:59.680 --> 3:41:06.960
 in America don't appreciate is how clever in their sadism the Soviets were.

3:41:06.960 --> 3:41:11.880
 And what they knew to do to Ukraine is everyone is starving, so they knew if you got some

3:41:11.880 --> 3:41:14.360
 meat on your bones, you're hiding food.

3:41:14.360 --> 3:41:18.680
 So they come back at night, take your hand, put in the door jam, keep slamming the door,

3:41:18.680 --> 3:41:19.680
 ransack your house.

3:41:19.680 --> 3:41:24.480
 They didn't have to find the food, burn down your house, take all your clothes, goodbye

3:41:24.480 --> 3:41:25.480
 and good luck.

3:41:25.480 --> 3:41:26.480
 I don't recall saying good luck.

3:41:26.480 --> 3:41:27.480
 Yeah.

3:41:27.480 --> 3:41:31.400
 So I highly recommend the movie because it's very well done.

3:41:31.400 --> 3:41:37.800
 It's very well directed, it's beautifully made, it's stunningly effective in illustrating

3:41:37.800 --> 3:41:38.800
 exactly that.

3:41:38.800 --> 3:41:44.320
 When you're in Ukraine during the famine, oh, your heart goes, I mean, it's crushing.

3:41:44.320 --> 3:41:45.640
 And it shifts to black and white.

3:41:45.640 --> 3:41:49.320
 It's very, very well made aesthetically, so highly recommend.

3:41:49.320 --> 3:41:53.040
 And it's written by Andriusha Lupa, she's a Ukrainian friend of mine, she introduced

3:41:53.040 --> 3:41:57.040
 me, Yanmi Park, who's a big North Korean defector.

3:41:57.040 --> 3:42:01.920
 And this is the kind of thing where I think more people need to...

3:42:01.920 --> 3:42:06.760
 When I wrote the new write, which talks a lot about the Nazis or the kind of neo Nazis,

3:42:06.760 --> 3:42:11.600
 on their big complaints against people who are Jewish, she's like, oh, we hear all about

3:42:11.600 --> 3:42:12.600
 the Holocaust.

3:42:12.600 --> 3:42:13.600
 How come you don't talk about the Holodomor?

3:42:13.600 --> 3:42:15.120
 I'm like, I'm trying to do my part.

3:42:15.120 --> 3:42:18.840
 I agree with you that we need to be talking more about the Holodomor.

3:42:18.840 --> 3:42:19.840
 Absolutely.

3:42:19.840 --> 3:42:24.240
 And it's sad, there are more movies that are anti Soviet, which tells you a lot about the

3:42:24.240 --> 3:42:26.400
 view of the intelligentsia.

3:42:26.400 --> 3:42:29.060
 It's a great idea, it just was badly implemented.

3:42:29.060 --> 3:42:34.440
 And no, it's a rotten idea, it's an evil idea, and it was implemented exactly how it has

3:42:34.440 --> 3:42:35.440
 to be implemented.

3:42:35.440 --> 3:42:37.520
 There's no alternative.

3:42:37.520 --> 3:42:44.240
 Can we talk about The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, and which character do you find

3:42:44.240 --> 3:42:49.720
 most fascinating, ones that kind of you meet in your own mind, that you almost have conversations

3:42:49.720 --> 3:42:54.080
 with or has an influence on you and your life in general?

3:42:54.080 --> 3:42:58.480
 You know what character I like, because I know no one ever gives this answer, but this

3:42:58.480 --> 3:43:00.320
 is my...

3:43:00.320 --> 3:43:04.240
 Just aesthetically, you know how sometimes you're drawn to a character and if this person

3:43:04.240 --> 3:43:07.200
 were real, you think they're just horrible, but there's something about the resonates

3:43:07.200 --> 3:43:08.200
 with you.

3:43:08.200 --> 3:43:13.240
 I can't even explain this, but I love the character in Atlas Shrugged of Lillian Reardon,

3:43:13.240 --> 3:43:15.040
 who is Hank Reardon's wife.

3:43:15.040 --> 3:43:21.520
 And what is amazing about her, so she's his wife, he's this big industrialist innovator,

3:43:21.520 --> 3:43:29.000
 and she's this like former beauty, but she's so cold and soulless that there's...

3:43:29.000 --> 3:43:33.220
 I mean, I joke about, you know, Ayn Rand's vampire novels, that character is as close

3:43:33.220 --> 3:43:37.120
 to a literal vampire as you're going to see in Rand.

3:43:37.120 --> 3:43:42.200
 And there's just this great scene where, you know, Hank Reardon invents Reardon metal.

3:43:42.200 --> 3:43:45.880
 It's this great metal, which is extremely strong, but extremely, it's like light, so

3:43:45.880 --> 3:43:48.200
 this creates all these innovations.

3:43:48.200 --> 3:43:52.080
 And he brings her a bracelet made of the first Reardon metal.

3:43:52.080 --> 3:43:53.400
 This is his life goal.

3:43:53.400 --> 3:43:55.540
 This is like Prometheus bringing fire.

3:43:55.540 --> 3:43:57.520
 And she's like, what the fuck is this?

3:43:57.520 --> 3:43:58.520
 You brought me diamonds.

3:43:58.520 --> 3:43:59.520
 Yeah, you could have brought me diamonds.

3:43:59.520 --> 3:44:00.520
 What is this shit?

3:44:00.520 --> 3:44:04.360
 And then Dagny, who is another industrialist, she's a heroine, very strong female character

3:44:04.360 --> 3:44:08.960
 in Atlas Shrugged, is at a party, and she goes, I got diamonds, let's trade.

3:44:08.960 --> 3:44:10.640
 And Lillian's like, you want this?

3:44:10.640 --> 3:44:13.480
 And she's like, yes, because that's the concretization of the human mind.

3:44:13.480 --> 3:44:14.700
 These are rocks.

3:44:14.700 --> 3:44:17.060
 And Lillian's like, okay, whatever.

3:44:17.060 --> 3:44:24.240
 And that character is someone who has a lot of resonance in our culture, this kind of

3:44:24.240 --> 3:44:25.600
 soulless...

3:44:25.600 --> 3:44:31.620
 It's easy to write a soulless male figure, like Peter Keating in some ways a soulless,

3:44:31.620 --> 3:44:39.200
 but that for some reason, when it's like a soulless female, it seems that much more chilling

3:44:39.200 --> 3:44:40.200
 and effective.

3:44:40.200 --> 3:44:43.680
 Do you not agree though, that Lillian Reardon is an amazingly very powerful figure?

3:44:43.680 --> 3:44:44.680
 Powerful figure.

3:44:44.680 --> 3:44:47.200
 And I think Reardon is too.

3:44:47.200 --> 3:44:51.240
 And what I love about Reardon is his evolution, right?

3:44:51.240 --> 3:44:52.560
 He's so flawed.

3:44:52.560 --> 3:44:57.560
 He's a hero who's completely flawed, and it drives me nuts when people say, her characters

3:44:57.560 --> 3:45:00.640
 are cartoonish, they never change, there's no emotion.

3:45:00.640 --> 3:45:01.640
 Really?

3:45:01.640 --> 3:45:03.480
 Did you read the same book I did?

3:45:03.480 --> 3:45:07.120
 Because if you take Reardon, and he's struggling and he's trying to deal with Lillian and his

3:45:07.120 --> 3:45:10.760
 family and all this stuff, and we know family members like this, right?

3:45:10.760 --> 3:45:15.960
 I mean, who are leeches and parasites, but he's excusing them because that's what he's

3:45:15.960 --> 3:45:17.200
 supposed to do.

3:45:17.200 --> 3:45:23.720
 And then as he evolves to fully realize what's going on, that evolution is difficult, it's

3:45:23.720 --> 3:45:24.720
 hard.

3:45:24.720 --> 3:45:27.960
 Like the scene after he has sex with Dagny, of course, he gives a speech, but the speeches

3:45:27.960 --> 3:45:34.400
 is such a good speech in terms of conveying his mind body split, right?

3:45:34.400 --> 3:45:38.280
 He thinks he really had fun, he really enjoyed the sex, right?

3:45:38.280 --> 3:45:43.280
 But he thinks it's animalistic, and he thinks it's a sign of his depravity, and he thinks,

3:45:43.280 --> 3:45:48.680
 and here he is, this woman he loves, and he adores her, and he can't connect the two,

3:45:48.680 --> 3:45:52.920
 he can't connect the sex with the love, he can't connect the sex with adoration, and

3:45:52.920 --> 3:45:53.920
 with the values.

3:45:53.920 --> 3:45:59.840
 So her characters are anything I think but cardboard characters, because I think Dagny

3:45:59.840 --> 3:46:05.400
 and the scenes where she's listening to music, and gets captured by the music and the way

3:46:05.400 --> 3:46:08.200
 Wren describes that, I think it's just beautiful.

3:46:08.200 --> 3:46:16.360
 Or the scene, my favorite scene in Atlas is the scene where they're taking the first train

3:46:16.360 --> 3:46:24.160
 ride across the John Gold Bridge, and they're in the engine room, and it's traveling through,

3:46:24.160 --> 3:46:28.960
 and the way she's describing Dagny, it's almost like Dagny's having sex with the machine,

3:46:28.960 --> 3:46:29.960
 right?

3:46:29.960 --> 3:46:34.800
 It's so powerful emotionally, their success, the fact that they did it.

3:46:34.800 --> 3:46:39.840
 Nobody told them it was impossible, and the train is going really fast, and that whole,

3:46:39.840 --> 3:46:46.760
 it's got a sexual vibe to it, it's all about passion, it's all about success, and it's

3:46:46.760 --> 3:46:51.160
 all about the success of their minds, and nobody else matters.

3:46:51.160 --> 3:46:54.720
 What's really great about that scene, just in terms of constructing the novel, I'm not

3:46:54.720 --> 3:46:59.360
 going to spoil anything, so the Atlas Shrugged has three acts, like three act structures

3:46:59.360 --> 3:47:04.760
 not uncommon, and the first act is about Hank Reardon overcoming all this adversity

3:47:04.760 --> 3:47:10.040
 at home in his personal life and in his business to create this great achievement.

3:47:10.040 --> 3:47:14.980
 So Rand really makes the reader invested in this character and his accomplishments, he's

3:47:14.980 --> 3:47:20.280
 unambiguously doing something good, there's no downside here, he's making it easier to

3:47:20.280 --> 3:47:24.180
 transport people, transport food, this is really just great.

3:47:24.180 --> 3:47:29.080
 And it's just, once you read it and you look back, you're like, she does such a masterful

3:47:29.080 --> 3:47:33.960
 job of making, you have to be a fan of this person and root for them, because she's like,

3:47:33.960 --> 3:47:36.760
 oh, you think things are going great, he's overcome?

3:47:36.760 --> 3:47:37.760
 Hold on a minute.

3:47:37.760 --> 3:47:43.320
 And then the rest of it, she's just real, and your sense of injustice is triggered as

3:47:43.320 --> 3:47:48.560
 a reader to such an nth degree, because you saw what he went through to get to this point,

3:47:48.560 --> 3:47:51.580
 and now you're seeing it taken away from people inferior to him.

3:47:51.580 --> 3:47:56.900
 And one of the quotes on Twitter I use all the time is, I'll see someone, politician

3:47:56.900 --> 3:48:02.640
 or a bureaucrat or a thinker, just advocate for something completely unconscionable.

3:48:02.640 --> 3:48:07.880
 And I'll just quote and say, my favorite criticism of Ayn Rand is that they say her villains

3:48:07.880 --> 3:48:13.080
 are too evil and unrealistic, because the things that people posit with a straight face

3:48:13.080 --> 3:48:16.480
 are so much worse than she has in her book.

3:48:16.480 --> 3:48:18.800
 And not just politicians, you find intellectuals today.

3:48:18.800 --> 3:48:19.800
 Oh, of course.

3:48:19.800 --> 3:48:20.800
 So yeah, yeah.

3:48:20.800 --> 3:48:21.800
 Way, way over the top.

3:48:21.800 --> 3:48:25.400
 You know, even whenever Adlai Shrugged I was going, nobody really talks like this.

3:48:25.400 --> 3:48:26.400
 No, they do.

3:48:26.400 --> 3:48:28.120
 Let me give you one example.

3:48:28.120 --> 3:48:31.960
 There was a story she wrote, which she never published, they published her journals, the

3:48:31.960 --> 3:48:33.560
 Ayn Rand Institute.

3:48:33.560 --> 3:48:36.600
 And there was one character, and this is a prototype of Ellsworth Toohey, he was the

3:48:36.600 --> 3:48:39.520
 villain of one of the villains of the Fountainhead.

3:48:39.520 --> 3:48:43.580
 And basically, the kid had like deformed legs or broke his legs or something like that.

3:48:43.580 --> 3:48:45.620
 And he wants to get leg braces.

3:48:45.620 --> 3:48:47.640
 And the dad is like, Oh, we're not going to do that.

3:48:47.640 --> 3:48:49.160
 Why should you be better than anyone else?

3:48:49.160 --> 3:48:52.320
 Like you should just have like this deformity, accept your fate.

3:48:52.320 --> 3:48:53.320
 And you're reading this.

3:48:53.320 --> 3:48:57.320
 I'm like, what dad is not going to give his kid leg braces, it's ridiculous.

3:48:57.320 --> 3:49:03.560
 But now it's not uncommon for deaf children to not get cochlear implants and not be able

3:49:03.560 --> 3:49:08.500
 to hear because their parents say, well, we're going to lose deaf culture.

3:49:08.500 --> 3:49:09.560
 Hearing is just information.

3:49:09.560 --> 3:49:13.160
 And you're sitting there, and whether you agree with this or not, this is very close

3:49:13.160 --> 3:49:14.880
 to what she was saying.

3:49:14.880 --> 3:49:18.720
 And when I read what she was saying, I'm like, okay, crazy Ayn Rand, this is not a thing.

3:49:18.720 --> 3:49:23.160
 And it's like, oh, yeah, the craziness is that it's not braces, it's hearing.

3:49:23.160 --> 3:49:24.160
 It's yeah.

3:49:24.160 --> 3:49:26.000
 And what evil to deny your kid hearing.

3:49:26.000 --> 3:49:27.720
 I mean, God.

3:49:27.720 --> 3:49:31.680
 So here's the thing, if you want deaf culture, which I would believe is a thing, sign language

3:49:31.680 --> 3:49:33.200
 or whatever, they could turn it off.

3:49:33.200 --> 3:49:34.200
 Yeah.

3:49:34.200 --> 3:49:35.200
 Yeah.

3:49:35.200 --> 3:49:36.200
 If you want, you give them the choice.

3:49:36.200 --> 3:49:37.200
 Yeah.

3:49:37.200 --> 3:49:38.200
 Tonight, I'm sorry, one more thing.

3:49:38.200 --> 3:49:41.640
 You know, Rand used the word evil frequently.

3:49:41.640 --> 3:49:45.240
 And I think maybe I can make the argument she used it too loosely.

3:49:45.240 --> 3:49:49.400
 If you are denying a child the gift of music, I will say that's evil.

3:49:49.400 --> 3:49:51.000
 I agree completely.

3:49:51.000 --> 3:49:52.000
 Unambiguously.

3:49:52.000 --> 3:49:53.000
 Yep.

3:49:53.000 --> 3:49:59.120
 If you go online and listen, watch videos of people getting hearing aids and being able

3:49:59.120 --> 3:50:05.040
 to hear for the first time, I promise you, you will cry because there's no pure, I'm

3:50:05.040 --> 3:50:06.440
 getting teared up right now.

3:50:06.440 --> 3:50:12.560
 There's no pure expression of humanity and technology at its best than seeing a two year

3:50:12.560 --> 3:50:15.440
 old or one and a half year old who can't even talk.

3:50:15.440 --> 3:50:18.040
 And then you see the reaction when they hear mom's voice.

3:50:18.040 --> 3:50:20.160
 It's so beautiful and moving.

3:50:20.160 --> 3:50:21.160
 Absolutely.

3:50:21.160 --> 3:50:22.160
 Yeah.

3:50:22.160 --> 3:50:23.160
 It's just moving.

3:50:23.160 --> 3:50:24.160
 It is.

3:50:24.160 --> 3:50:28.320
 It's like it's one of the, one of the ways to rethink technology, perhaps.

3:50:28.320 --> 3:50:32.440
 And there's this, this is really funny because sometimes it'll be this tough dude, right?

3:50:32.440 --> 3:50:34.000
 And he's been deaf all his life.

3:50:34.000 --> 3:50:36.720
 And then they put the hearing aid and the girl is like, can you hear me?

3:50:36.720 --> 3:50:40.960
 And he's trying to be tough for three seconds and you just sit there.

3:50:40.960 --> 3:50:41.960
 No, absolutely.

3:50:41.960 --> 3:50:43.480
 And that's true of any sense.

3:50:43.480 --> 3:50:44.480
 I mean.

3:50:44.480 --> 3:50:46.960
 Like colorblind people seeing color for the first time, that kind of thing.

3:50:46.960 --> 3:50:48.040
 I think there's a few.

3:50:48.040 --> 3:50:50.800
 It's not quite the same, but it's somewhat.

3:50:50.800 --> 3:50:55.080
 But if you're blind and suddenly can see, I mean, it's just, it's just stunning.

3:50:55.080 --> 3:50:57.160
 I mean, and how do we form our concepts?

3:50:57.160 --> 3:50:58.160
 How do we think?

3:50:58.160 --> 3:51:02.040
 We have to, we get information from reality, right?

3:51:02.040 --> 3:51:06.820
 We interact with reality through our senses and that's how we become conceptual beings.

3:51:06.820 --> 3:51:09.720
 And you deny an element of that from a human being.

3:51:09.720 --> 3:51:10.720
 That is horrible.

3:51:10.720 --> 3:51:14.600
 There's a potential with that, with the Neuralink too, so further developments there.

3:51:14.600 --> 3:51:18.800
 So I mean on that, there's a powerful question of who is John Galt.

3:51:18.800 --> 3:51:21.360
 I don't know if we can do this without spoiler alerts.

3:51:21.360 --> 3:51:22.360
 Yeah, don't spoil the book.

3:51:22.360 --> 3:51:23.360
 Okay.

3:51:23.360 --> 3:51:25.000
 Well, but you can say, you can say.

3:51:25.000 --> 3:51:26.440
 What's the importance of this character?

3:51:26.440 --> 3:51:27.440
 What's the importance of this question?

3:51:27.440 --> 3:51:32.440
 I mean, without the, so I want to give a talk on who is John Galt and who is John Galt in

3:51:32.440 --> 3:51:35.700
 a sense is anybody who takes their own life seriously.

3:51:35.700 --> 3:51:40.440
 Anybody who's willing to really live fully their own life, use their mind in pursuit

3:51:40.440 --> 3:51:47.580
 of their rational values and pursue their happiness fully uncompromisingly with no comp,

3:51:47.580 --> 3:51:53.200
 with no compromise and sticking to the integrity.

3:51:53.200 --> 3:51:55.040
 Anybody can be John Galt in that sense.

3:51:55.040 --> 3:52:02.440
 I think one of the mottos I live by is all we are tasked to, maybe this is a little bit

3:52:02.440 --> 3:52:04.320
 religious but I think your own is going to agree with it.

3:52:04.320 --> 3:52:05.880
 I'm sure you'll agree with it.

3:52:05.880 --> 3:52:09.600
 All any of us can do is leave the world a little bit of a better place than we found

3:52:09.600 --> 3:52:10.600
 it.

3:52:10.600 --> 3:52:15.420
 And I think if you do that through hard work, being honest, being a kind, not at the expense

3:52:15.420 --> 3:52:20.280
 of other people, you can go to your grave patting yourself on the back.

3:52:20.280 --> 3:52:26.960
 I mean, to me, leaving the world a better place, yeah, I mean, that's not what drives

3:52:26.960 --> 3:52:27.960
 me.

3:52:27.960 --> 3:52:29.760
 What drives me is, I mean, what I think drives people.

3:52:29.760 --> 3:52:34.960
 I think just live a good life and good life means a life you're happy living and part

3:52:34.960 --> 3:52:41.640
 of that is the impact you have on the world but it's, so many people live wasted lives,

3:52:41.640 --> 3:52:45.140
 live mediocre lives, live conventional lives.

3:52:45.140 --> 3:52:48.760
 Maybe they even leave the world a better place but they didn't really, they didn't –

3:52:48.760 --> 3:52:50.080
 But they didn't leave the world a better place.

3:52:50.080 --> 3:52:57.800
 They left the world a better place but they didn't live their potential or they died

3:52:57.800 --> 3:53:01.520
 feeling guilty about it or they – a million different things.

3:53:01.520 --> 3:53:02.720
 So there's so many productive people.

3:53:02.720 --> 3:53:06.680
 I mean, think about all the innovators and the technologists and the businessmen who

3:53:06.680 --> 3:53:10.480
 leave the world a better place by a big shot but are never happy.

3:53:10.480 --> 3:53:14.320
 Never happy in their own souls, in their own life.

3:53:14.320 --> 3:53:17.640
 And to me, that's what counts and if you're going to be happy, you'll leave the better

3:53:17.640 --> 3:53:18.640
 world a better place.

3:53:18.640 --> 3:53:20.220
 And that's what Jean Val symbolizes.

3:53:20.220 --> 3:53:29.120
 To me, it's living your life by your standards, by your values and pursuing that happiness.

3:53:29.120 --> 3:53:33.560
 Well, I take – I'm sorry, I take in a different context because I think a lot of – and I

3:53:33.560 --> 3:53:35.000
 don't think you're going to disagree with this.

3:53:35.000 --> 3:53:38.280
 I think a lot of times when you're young, you have unrealistic expectations about what

3:53:38.280 --> 3:53:41.160
 you're going to accomplish and you think to yourself, well, I thought, let's suppose

3:53:41.160 --> 3:53:42.160
 someone wants to go into politics.

3:53:42.160 --> 3:53:44.480
 Well, if I'm not elected president, I'm a failure.

3:53:44.480 --> 3:53:45.480
 That's nonsensical.

3:53:45.480 --> 3:53:48.800
 There's lots of people who are successful who haven't achieved literally the top position

3:53:48.800 --> 3:53:49.800
 in their role.

3:53:49.800 --> 3:53:54.320
 So if you can go to your grave having – defending everything you've done and you move the needle

3:53:54.320 --> 3:53:55.320
 in the –

3:53:55.320 --> 3:53:56.320
 Yes.

3:53:56.320 --> 3:53:57.320
 Successes should not be relative.

3:53:57.320 --> 3:53:58.320
 Yes.

3:53:58.320 --> 3:53:59.320
 So that goes back to second handedness.

3:53:59.320 --> 3:54:00.320
 Yes.

3:54:00.320 --> 3:54:01.320
 Success is not being better than other people.

3:54:01.320 --> 3:54:03.360
 Success is not being the best.

3:54:03.360 --> 3:54:06.480
 Success is maximizing your potential, whatever that is.

3:54:06.480 --> 3:54:13.960
 And look, I know people – I have a son who could be a really good engineer, a really

3:54:13.960 --> 3:54:18.880
 good mathematician, really good scientist, but he decided he wants to write comedy.

3:54:18.880 --> 3:54:23.160
 So he might have been a better mathematician than he is a comedian, but that's his values.

3:54:23.160 --> 3:54:24.160
 That's his goals.

3:54:24.160 --> 3:54:25.760
 That's what he wants to do.

3:54:25.760 --> 3:54:29.080
 And hopefully he'll be really, really good at that and he'll be incredibly successful

3:54:29.080 --> 3:54:34.600
 at it materially in every other sense, but that's what you pursue.

3:54:34.600 --> 3:54:39.640
 So it's really being true to yourself in a deep sense.

3:54:39.640 --> 3:54:43.200
 And if you are true to yourself, yeah, you'll leave the world a better place, but that's

3:54:43.200 --> 3:54:44.200
 not the essence.

3:54:44.200 --> 3:54:45.680
 The essence is you.

3:54:45.680 --> 3:54:47.340
 No, focus on you.

3:54:47.340 --> 3:54:50.160
 Focus on making your life the best life that it can be.

3:54:50.160 --> 3:54:54.760
 And if you do that, you'll make the world a better place by – almost by definition.

3:54:54.760 --> 3:54:55.760
 Yeah.

3:54:55.760 --> 3:54:56.760
 You'll impact people.

3:54:56.760 --> 3:54:58.960
 We're looking at the same thing in different ways.

3:54:58.960 --> 3:54:59.960
 Yeah.

3:54:59.960 --> 3:55:06.760
 So at least in my little corner of the world, it was disappointing how rare that is.

3:55:06.760 --> 3:55:12.920
 So one of the reasons I'm here in Austin and one of the reasons my work gravitated

3:55:12.920 --> 3:55:21.120
 towards Elon Musk is because he represents that person for me in the world of technology,

3:55:21.120 --> 3:55:23.760
 in the world of CEO, in the world of business.

3:55:23.760 --> 3:55:29.360
 It was very surprising to me the more I've learned about the world of tech, how few people

3:55:29.360 --> 3:55:35.480
 live unapologetically, fully to their potential.

3:55:35.480 --> 3:55:38.120
 I'm sure people, others do that.

3:55:38.120 --> 3:55:39.120
 Maybe music and art.

3:55:39.120 --> 3:55:40.120
 I'm not sure.

3:55:40.120 --> 3:55:41.120
 I don't know about those worlds.

3:55:41.120 --> 3:55:43.320
 I do know about the technology world.

3:55:43.320 --> 3:55:49.400
 And it was disappointing to me how many people compromise their integrity in subtle ways

3:55:49.400 --> 3:55:52.080
 at first, but then it becomes a slippery slope and then you –

3:55:52.080 --> 3:55:53.200
 Can I say this?

3:55:53.200 --> 3:55:57.400
 There's this great quote and I always forget if it's Steinbeck or Hemingway and the quote

3:55:57.400 --> 3:56:01.760
 – and this applies for money, it applies for morality – the quote was, how did you

3:56:01.760 --> 3:56:03.280
 go bankrupt?

3:56:03.280 --> 3:56:06.500
 And he says two ways, gradually and then suddenly.

3:56:06.500 --> 3:56:10.160
 It's very hard to one day be like, I have no integrity.

3:56:10.160 --> 3:56:11.240
 That doesn't happen.

3:56:11.240 --> 3:56:15.720
 It's very easy if it's like, look, I stole this candy bar.

3:56:15.720 --> 3:56:17.920
 What's the big deal if I steal this thing?

3:56:17.920 --> 3:56:18.920
 Then you're still –

3:56:18.920 --> 3:56:20.640
 People say there are no slippery slopes.

3:56:20.640 --> 3:56:24.040
 There are and they're big and they're very slippery and people slide.

3:56:24.040 --> 3:56:25.360
 This is the biggest one.

3:56:25.360 --> 3:56:27.820
 And people violate their integrity even without stealing.

3:56:27.820 --> 3:56:31.700
 Just little things about how they treat other people, how they treat themselves, the values

3:56:31.700 --> 3:56:32.700
 they pursue.

3:56:32.700 --> 3:56:34.660
 They don't go after the profession they really wanted to.

3:56:34.660 --> 3:56:39.200
 They compromise in ways that they shouldn't with their spouse or with their mothers or

3:56:39.200 --> 3:56:40.200
 whatever.

3:56:40.200 --> 3:56:42.680
 And then they wake up one day when they're 40.

3:56:42.680 --> 3:56:47.480
 And this is why people go through a midlife crisis.

3:56:47.480 --> 3:56:51.200
 Midlife crisis is a crisis where you suddenly realize, I didn't do it.

3:56:51.200 --> 3:56:52.800
 I didn't live up to my standards.

3:56:52.800 --> 3:56:55.920
 I didn't live up to my youthful idealism.

3:56:55.920 --> 3:56:57.840
 I compromised and I sold out.

3:56:57.840 --> 3:57:00.120
 But I also would warn you about Silicon Valley.

3:57:00.120 --> 3:57:06.960
 Yeah, I think at the top very few of them stick to it and partially it's the political

3:57:06.960 --> 3:57:07.960
 pressure is unbearable.

3:57:07.960 --> 3:57:09.800
 I mean, how would you?

3:57:09.800 --> 3:57:10.800
 How can you?

3:57:10.800 --> 3:57:13.700
 It would require to be a hero and very few of them are.

3:57:13.700 --> 3:57:18.120
 But there are a lot of people who do really well at all kinds of levels in technology

3:57:18.120 --> 3:57:20.160
 who – little startups, people.

3:57:20.160 --> 3:57:21.160
 And this is the point Michael was making.

3:57:21.160 --> 3:57:22.160
 You don't have to be the best.

3:57:22.160 --> 3:57:23.160
 Yeah.

3:57:23.160 --> 3:57:28.600
 You know, you don't have to be a CEO to live to your max and to live with integrity

3:57:28.600 --> 3:57:30.720
 and to live a great life.

3:57:30.720 --> 3:57:36.560
 I know people who because they joined Amazon or whatever have just made a life for themselves,

3:57:36.560 --> 3:57:41.640
 an amazing life for themselves and have done great work at Amazon let's say and then

3:57:41.640 --> 3:57:45.700
 have lived a great life because of the opportunity that created for them.

3:57:45.700 --> 3:57:51.520
 So I think there are more good people out there but yes, one of the saddest things of

3:57:51.520 --> 3:57:57.960
 growing up is – or even when you're a teenager and looking at adults and noticing

3:57:57.960 --> 3:58:04.400
 how few of them actually live, I mean really alive in a sense of living their values and

3:58:04.400 --> 3:58:05.400
 enjoying their life.

3:58:05.400 --> 3:58:10.200
 And you start with your parents and you look across the people, everybody lives such mediocre

3:58:10.200 --> 3:58:11.200
 lives.

3:58:11.200 --> 3:58:12.200
 Yeah.

3:58:12.200 --> 3:58:13.200
 And the other thing is they don't have to.

3:58:13.200 --> 3:58:14.200
 That's what people don't appreciate.

3:58:14.200 --> 3:58:15.200
 They don't have to.

3:58:15.200 --> 3:58:18.720
 Particularly not in the world that we live in today that's so wealthy and so many – we

3:58:18.720 --> 3:58:20.440
 all have so many opportunities.

3:58:20.440 --> 3:58:27.760
 So what – by way of advice, what advice would you give to young people to live their

3:58:27.760 --> 3:58:28.760
 life fully?

3:58:28.760 --> 3:58:35.480
 I mean Michael and I have talked about this but it bears repeating.

3:58:35.480 --> 3:58:40.040
 So if you look at John Galt, if you look at the highest ideals of what we – of a life

3:58:40.040 --> 3:58:43.960
 we could live, what advice would you give to a 20 year old today, 18 year old?

3:58:43.960 --> 3:58:46.840
 Can I say – I don't think – and I think Rand would agree.

3:58:46.840 --> 3:58:51.720
 When Rand was writing John Galt, she says, when you have this character's human perfection,

3:58:51.720 --> 3:58:53.400
 you don't want to get too close.

3:58:53.400 --> 3:58:56.920
 So he's a little bit of a vague character because she was aware that when you're dealing

3:58:56.920 --> 3:58:59.480
 with day to day, it kind of – the shine comes off.

3:58:59.480 --> 3:59:03.200
 I think Rourke is a lot better character for a young person.

3:59:03.200 --> 3:59:04.200
 Oh really?

3:59:04.200 --> 3:59:07.300
 Yeah, but Rourke is all – the entirety of the Fountainhead is Rourke.

3:59:07.300 --> 3:59:08.440
 So Ed Reardon is the one of several.

3:59:08.440 --> 3:59:09.440
 We barely know John Galt.

3:59:09.440 --> 3:59:10.440
 Yeah.

3:59:10.440 --> 3:59:12.980
 So but Rourke is someone where you could be like, okay.

3:59:12.980 --> 3:59:15.600
 And what Rourke also gives young people is –

3:59:15.600 --> 3:59:16.600
 That's in the Fountainhead.

3:59:16.600 --> 3:59:20.160
 That's in the Fountainhead, is the strength to persevere.

3:59:20.160 --> 3:59:23.520
 Because when you're young, you're going to have down times.

3:59:23.520 --> 3:59:25.720
 There's going to be times when you're lonely.

3:59:25.720 --> 3:59:28.160
 There's going to be times when you don't have a girlfriend.

3:59:28.160 --> 3:59:32.080
 There's going to be times when you're out of work and you're thinking, holy crap, I'm

3:59:32.080 --> 3:59:33.480
 falling between the cracks.

3:59:33.480 --> 3:59:34.600
 I'm going to accomplish that.

3:59:34.600 --> 3:59:36.040
 I'm going to be a failure.

3:59:36.040 --> 3:59:38.960
 And he gives them the courage.

3:59:38.960 --> 3:59:42.120
 There's even a scene in the Fountainhead, which is this amazing scene.

3:59:42.120 --> 3:59:45.800
 I love that it's not talked about enough where basically Rourke is looking at one of

3:59:45.800 --> 3:59:50.800
 his buildings and this little kid on a bicycle comes up to him and – Yaron, please correct

3:59:50.800 --> 3:59:51.800
 me.

3:59:51.800 --> 3:59:52.800
 And he's like, who built this?

3:59:52.800 --> 3:59:54.720
 And Rourke said, I did.

3:59:54.720 --> 3:59:58.240
 And the line is, you know, Rourke didn't realize it, but he just gave that kid the

3:59:58.240 --> 4:00:00.080
 courage to face the lifetime.

4:00:00.080 --> 4:00:06.360
 And I think that is such a beautiful thing where you can find inspiration in this character.

4:00:06.360 --> 4:00:08.440
 Don't become needlessly difficult.

4:00:08.440 --> 4:00:10.020
 Don't start parroting his lines.

4:00:10.020 --> 4:00:12.920
 You're not Howard Rourke and he's not a real person.

4:00:12.920 --> 4:00:16.580
 But there's aspects of him that you can apply to your life.

4:00:16.580 --> 4:00:17.580
 And here's something else.

4:00:17.580 --> 4:00:20.080
 I'll give you one example because this happened to me.

4:00:20.080 --> 4:00:23.800
 When I was working at Goldman Sachs, I was doing tech support and my great grandmother

4:00:23.800 --> 4:00:25.400
 had passed away that year.

4:00:25.400 --> 4:00:28.800
 And I promised my grandmother I would have – I've told this story several times.

4:00:28.800 --> 4:00:30.960
 I would have Thanksgiving dinner with her.

4:00:30.960 --> 4:00:35.740
 I was working second shift, fort to midnight, and we were a 24 seven help desk.

4:00:35.740 --> 4:00:39.640
 And I got the schedule for the next week and I sold my grandmother to have lunch with

4:00:39.640 --> 4:00:40.900
 her at Thanksgiving.

4:00:40.900 --> 4:00:44.680
 And they had put me down from fort to midnight the day before Wednesday, which is my normal

4:00:44.680 --> 4:00:47.160
 shift, but then the day shift the next day.

4:00:47.160 --> 4:00:50.840
 And I go to my boss, I go – first off, second shift, I'm like, this Thanksgiving, I promised

4:00:50.840 --> 4:00:51.920
 my grandma.

4:00:51.920 --> 4:00:54.560
 And they're like, well, if you could find someone to fill this, we'll do it.

4:00:54.560 --> 4:00:55.560
 And I asked everyone.

4:00:55.560 --> 4:00:56.560
 They're like, no.

4:00:56.560 --> 4:00:58.580
 And I said, I'm not coming in.

4:00:58.580 --> 4:01:03.440
 And I 100%, not even a question, if I asked my grandmother, can we have dinner instead,

4:01:03.440 --> 4:01:04.680
 she would have said yes.

4:01:04.680 --> 4:01:08.320
 But this was one of those moments, maybe this is from my huge ego where I felt like I was

4:01:08.320 --> 4:01:10.280
 in a movie and I'm making a choice.

4:01:10.280 --> 4:01:12.880
 Am I going to ask grandma?

4:01:12.880 --> 4:01:15.100
 Or am I going to just bend the knee?

4:01:15.100 --> 4:01:19.280
 And I go, I go, I couldn't find anyone and I go, I'm not coming in.

4:01:19.280 --> 4:01:21.600
 And they go, if you're not coming in, you're fired.

4:01:21.600 --> 4:01:23.160
 And I go, fire me.

4:01:23.160 --> 4:01:24.880
 And they did fire me.

4:01:24.880 --> 4:01:27.080
 And I have no regrets.

4:01:27.080 --> 4:01:31.120
 And because if I compromised, I'd have money in my pocket.

4:01:31.120 --> 4:01:34.080
 But since I didn't compromise, I could look at that story.

4:01:34.080 --> 4:01:36.840
 Rand talks about how man is a being of self made soul.

4:01:36.840 --> 4:01:42.280
 I could look at that story, and next time, I have a time where it's a tough decision,

4:01:42.280 --> 4:01:45.920
 where there's really pressure, I could be like, you know what, this is the kind of person

4:01:45.920 --> 4:01:47.140
 you are.

4:01:47.140 --> 4:01:48.140
 Stick to it.

4:01:48.140 --> 4:01:49.140
 I'll give one more example.

4:01:49.140 --> 4:01:50.140
 Sorry, you're on.

4:01:50.140 --> 4:01:51.760
 I've given talks on networking.

4:01:51.760 --> 4:01:55.620
 And I tell people, I like to use humor, because humor is a great way to shortcut the brain

4:01:55.620 --> 4:01:57.160
 and get the truth to them directly.

4:01:57.160 --> 4:02:04.240
 I say, if you know someone is in town, it's their birthday, and they're not doing anything,

4:02:04.240 --> 4:02:05.240
 take them out.

4:02:05.240 --> 4:02:06.360
 And I say, I do this for Rand reasons.

4:02:06.360 --> 4:02:07.360
 I do it selfishly.

4:02:07.360 --> 4:02:08.720
 And the audience laughs.

4:02:08.720 --> 4:02:09.720
 And I go, you're laughing.

4:02:09.720 --> 4:02:14.840
 But I go, the guy who takes people out for their birthday is awesome.

4:02:14.840 --> 4:02:15.840
 That could be you.

4:02:15.840 --> 4:02:16.840
 There's nothing stopping you.

4:02:16.840 --> 4:02:20.280
 You're just not thinking in these terms, what's it going to cost you $30?

4:02:20.280 --> 4:02:24.360
 But for the rest of their life, or a few years, that person will remember you and be like,

4:02:24.360 --> 4:02:27.160
 you know what, this person did right by me.

4:02:27.160 --> 4:02:31.400
 And I'll give you a concrete example, which changed my life profoundly.

4:02:31.400 --> 4:02:35.960
 Ted Hope, who was the producer of the film American Splendor, which starred my mentor

4:02:35.960 --> 4:02:42.200
 Harvey Pekar, sent an email to his firm that said Harvey's in town with nothing to do.

4:02:42.200 --> 4:02:44.400
 If you want to hang out with him, here's your chance.

4:02:44.400 --> 4:02:46.080
 They worked at a film company.

4:02:46.080 --> 4:02:51.000
 And I was the only one, I got the email, I wasn't working there from a friend who took

4:02:51.000 --> 4:02:52.200
 him up on it.

4:02:52.200 --> 4:02:55.520
 And as a consequence, Harvey wrote a graphic novel about me, Ego and Hubris, which is $250

4:02:55.520 --> 4:02:58.400
 on eBay now, and it moves at that, not too shabby.

4:02:58.400 --> 4:03:03.620
 The point being, you know what, someone had a movie made about him.

4:03:03.620 --> 4:03:05.000
 Someone is an interesting figure.

4:03:05.000 --> 4:03:07.960
 Take the lunch and stay overtime for an hour.

4:03:07.960 --> 4:03:11.160
 But so many people don't think in those terms.

4:03:11.160 --> 4:03:12.960
 And there's so many opportunities for them.

4:03:12.960 --> 4:03:14.480
 And so that's the advice I give.

4:03:14.480 --> 4:03:17.560
 And I think it's also good to give advice via anecdote.

4:03:17.560 --> 4:03:21.880
 So not only is the person getting the advice, they are learning why you got to that point.

4:03:21.880 --> 4:03:24.240
 And maybe I'm wrong, but at least they've thought about it.

4:03:24.240 --> 4:03:26.200
 Yeah, I mean, I agree with all of that.

4:03:26.200 --> 4:03:31.160
 And I like the line, Ayn Rand's line about man is a self made soul, is a creature of

4:03:31.160 --> 4:03:33.680
 self made soul is huge.

4:03:33.680 --> 4:03:37.880
 And it's something most people don't realize, and it's something that modern intellectuals

4:03:37.880 --> 4:03:38.880
 undermine.

4:03:38.880 --> 4:03:43.240
 I mean, even somebody like Sam Harris, when you keep telling people they don't have free

4:03:43.240 --> 4:03:46.000
 will, then you don't have a self made soul.

4:03:46.000 --> 4:03:49.840
 Because what is self made, there is no self, according to Sam, right?

4:03:49.840 --> 4:03:52.760
 He meditates and he sees that he doesn't have a self.

4:03:52.760 --> 4:03:59.200
 So you're undermining the ability of people to take control of their own lives and make

4:03:59.200 --> 4:04:03.880
 the kind of choices that are necessary to create the kind of moral character that is

4:04:03.880 --> 4:04:05.600
 necessary for them to be successful.

4:04:05.600 --> 4:04:12.280
 So I'd encourage people to go read Foundhead and Atlas Shrugged because put aside the politics,

4:04:12.280 --> 4:04:19.760
 put aside even aspects of the philosophy, focus on these models.

4:04:19.760 --> 4:04:22.560
 How to Walk is a great model for all of us.

4:04:22.560 --> 4:04:28.140
 It's a great story to have in your head, in your mind when you encounter challenging choices

4:04:28.140 --> 4:04:30.520
 that you might make.

4:04:30.520 --> 4:04:35.520
 And then spend the time, and this is, I don't think I ever did this when I was young, I

4:04:35.520 --> 4:04:39.120
 don't think people do this, but spend the time thinking about what your values really

4:04:39.120 --> 4:04:40.120
 are.

4:04:40.120 --> 4:04:42.460
 What do you love doing?

4:04:42.460 --> 4:04:44.980
 What makes, what gets you going?

4:04:44.980 --> 4:04:46.720
 What gets you excited?

4:04:46.720 --> 4:04:50.060
 And how can I make a living at this?

4:04:50.060 --> 4:04:53.560
 How can I do this and live through this?

4:04:53.560 --> 4:04:58.120
 And then, you know, think about what kind of life you want, what kind of, I don't know,

4:04:58.120 --> 4:04:59.680
 what kind of people you want to hang out with.

4:04:59.680 --> 4:05:03.720
 Don't just, don't let life just happen to you.

4:05:03.720 --> 4:05:04.720
 Think it through.

4:05:04.720 --> 4:05:07.840
 What kind of people, for example, if you want ambitious, excited, maybe you should move

4:05:07.840 --> 4:05:11.160
 to Silicon Valley, to Austin, Texas, right?

4:05:11.160 --> 4:05:14.680
 If you want to be around artsy people, I mean, you should go to Hollywood, maybe you should

4:05:14.680 --> 4:05:20.120
 go to New York, you know, I don't know, but figure out what kind of life you want to live,

4:05:20.120 --> 4:05:23.200
 what kind of people you want to hang out with, what kind of woman you want to spend your

4:05:23.200 --> 4:05:28.640
 life with, what kind of romantic relationship you want to have, figure that out and go and

4:05:28.640 --> 4:05:29.640
 do it.

4:05:29.640 --> 4:05:30.640
 Don't sit around.

4:05:30.640 --> 4:05:31.640
 Life is not...

4:05:31.640 --> 4:05:32.640
 Or try and fail.

4:05:32.640 --> 4:05:33.640
 It's okay.

4:05:33.640 --> 4:05:34.640
 You're going to fail.

4:05:34.640 --> 4:05:35.640
 Oh, failure, failure, absolutely.

4:05:35.640 --> 4:05:36.640
 Don't fail.

4:05:36.640 --> 4:05:37.640
 Yeah.

4:05:37.640 --> 4:05:38.640
 And learn from that failure.

4:05:38.640 --> 4:05:39.640
 And that's another thing.

4:05:39.640 --> 4:05:41.800
 Think about what you're doing, why you're succeeding, why you're failing, and keep improving.

4:05:41.800 --> 4:05:44.160
 Keep working on it because it's not just going to happen like this.

4:05:44.160 --> 4:05:48.560
 Nobody is Francisco to take a character out of Atlas Shark, to succeed at everything,

4:05:48.560 --> 4:05:50.380
 first try, right?

4:05:50.380 --> 4:05:51.720
 We all need to fail a few times.

4:05:51.720 --> 4:05:56.200
 We all need to, but what have you got to lose?

4:05:56.200 --> 4:05:58.760
 Every second is never going to be back.

4:05:58.760 --> 4:06:02.440
 I mean, these are all cliches, but they're all true cliches.

4:06:02.440 --> 4:06:11.420
 So think, figure out what your values are, and try to apply your reason, your rational

4:06:11.420 --> 4:06:14.360
 thought on getting those values.

4:06:14.360 --> 4:06:18.760
 We talked about early on in the show, in the interview, we talked about integrating your

4:06:18.760 --> 4:06:21.200
 emotions with your cognition.

4:06:21.200 --> 4:06:24.880
 I think that's crucial because you don't want to be fighting your emotions as you move towards

4:06:24.880 --> 4:06:25.880
 these things.

4:06:25.880 --> 4:06:28.400
 You don't want your emotions to be barriers to your own success.

4:06:28.400 --> 4:06:35.280
 You want them to be cheerleaders, to chew on when good things happen and to be negative

4:06:35.280 --> 4:06:38.320
 emotions when it's justified that they're negative.

4:06:38.320 --> 4:06:41.000
 So work on integrating your soul.

4:06:41.000 --> 4:06:44.180
 So creating your own soul, that's the real challenge.

4:06:44.180 --> 4:06:46.420
 And I'll give one piece of meta advice.

4:06:46.420 --> 4:06:49.520
 When you're young, you're going to be clueless because you're going to be ignorant, you know

4:06:49.520 --> 4:06:50.700
 the data.

4:06:50.700 --> 4:06:56.360
 Don't ask your dopey friends for advice because they want to be helpful, but the friends want

4:06:56.360 --> 4:06:57.360
 to be helpful.

4:06:57.360 --> 4:06:58.360
 They're as dopey as you.

4:06:58.360 --> 4:06:59.640
 They have uninformed as you.

4:06:59.640 --> 4:07:02.560
 So they're just going to give you platitudes and you're going to be worse off because now

4:07:02.560 --> 4:07:06.180
 you're going to be confused, especially with social media.

4:07:06.180 --> 4:07:09.320
 Reach out to people who are older than you, who are accomplished.

4:07:09.320 --> 4:07:13.040
 You'd be surprised how often that you got to send them 20 bucks, buy them dinner, buy

4:07:13.040 --> 4:07:15.320
 their book, whatever it takes.

4:07:15.320 --> 4:07:22.360
 You are getting free world class advice for very cheap and that is really a mechanism

4:07:22.360 --> 4:07:23.360
 for success.

4:07:23.360 --> 4:07:25.760
 And here's something very unpopular and not sexy.

4:07:25.760 --> 4:07:28.320
 This is why people probably unfollow me.

4:07:28.320 --> 4:07:29.320
 That's not why.

4:07:29.320 --> 4:07:30.320
 Read.

4:07:30.320 --> 4:07:32.040
 Well, you'll tell me why after this.

4:07:32.040 --> 4:07:33.440
 Read, read, read.

4:07:33.440 --> 4:07:36.760
 Because you're not always going to have access to those experts.

4:07:36.760 --> 4:07:39.280
 And I'm not just talking about self help books.

4:07:39.280 --> 4:07:41.240
 I'm not even talking about self help books.

4:07:41.240 --> 4:07:42.520
 Read the words with literature.

4:07:42.520 --> 4:07:47.280
 I mean, literature presents you with all the different characters.

4:07:47.280 --> 4:07:50.960
 You know, read Dostoevsky, right?

4:07:50.960 --> 4:07:52.760
 Read Hugo, right?

4:07:52.760 --> 4:07:56.840
 Read all these authors that have taken time to really create characters and put them in

4:07:56.840 --> 4:08:01.280
 situations that maybe you will never face those exact situations, but you'll face similar

4:08:01.280 --> 4:08:04.580
 situations and they play it out for you.

4:08:04.580 --> 4:08:06.920
 You'll see what the consequences are.

4:08:06.920 --> 4:08:10.500
 Great literature is a real tool for building your soul.

4:08:10.500 --> 4:08:14.840
 Read generally with literature and particularly because it's more conceptual.

4:08:14.840 --> 4:08:20.720
 What maybe you could speak to love and relationship in your own life, but in general, if we look

4:08:20.720 --> 4:08:26.360
 at Alice Shrugged, if we look at Fountainhead, and maybe this is going to become a therapy

4:08:26.360 --> 4:08:32.680
 session for Lex, but also just looking at your own life in a form of advice, how can

4:08:32.680 --> 4:08:41.160
 you be a heroic Reardon type character and live your life to the fullest in creating

4:08:41.160 --> 4:08:48.040
 the most amazing things that you're able to create and yet have others in your life that

4:08:48.040 --> 4:08:54.000
 you give yourself to in terms of loving them fully and having a family, having kids, but

4:08:54.000 --> 4:08:57.840
 just even just the love of your life kind of thing.

4:08:57.840 --> 4:09:00.240
 How do you balance those things together?

4:09:00.240 --> 4:09:02.320
 Is there any anything to say?

4:09:02.320 --> 4:09:05.000
 I'll say one thing because then I'll defer to you, Ron, because he's the one who's married

4:09:05.000 --> 4:09:06.000
 here.

4:09:06.000 --> 4:09:07.080
 I don't think it's a balance.

4:09:07.080 --> 4:09:09.560
 I think they compliment each other and feed off each other.

4:09:09.560 --> 4:09:12.240
 So it's like, how do you balance having shoes and pants?

4:09:12.240 --> 4:09:14.040
 It's like, no, you want both.

4:09:14.040 --> 4:09:15.040
 You want it all.

4:09:15.040 --> 4:09:19.560
 And having a great partner who thinks you're a badass and then sometimes they're on the

4:09:19.560 --> 4:09:22.320
 stage and you're like, oh my, I'm married to a badass.

4:09:22.320 --> 4:09:23.320
 That's the goal.

4:09:23.320 --> 4:09:24.320
 Am I wrong?

4:09:24.320 --> 4:09:25.320
 No, absolutely.

4:09:25.320 --> 4:09:26.320
 It feeds off of each other.

4:09:26.320 --> 4:09:27.320
 It's synergetic.

4:09:27.320 --> 4:09:28.320
 It's completely synergetic.

4:09:28.320 --> 4:09:33.160
 The problem that people have, I think, where they get into challenges is when they view

4:09:33.160 --> 4:09:35.080
 them as opposites, right?

4:09:35.080 --> 4:09:36.080
 Work or family.

4:09:36.080 --> 4:09:42.800
 Well, if you don't work the family, you can't finance the family, but more than that.

4:09:42.800 --> 4:09:45.720
 Why is your wife going to love you?

4:09:45.720 --> 4:09:47.360
 What are the virtues that you're bringing?

4:09:47.360 --> 4:09:51.080
 If you don't maximize your own potential, if you don't live the best life that you can

4:09:51.080 --> 4:09:52.840
 live, what is it to love?

4:09:52.840 --> 4:09:56.640
 And if she doesn't do the same thing, why do you love her?

4:09:56.640 --> 4:10:02.080
 So you don't get this conflict between work and, you know, how do I have a balanced life?

4:10:02.080 --> 4:10:03.560
 Of course you have a balanced life.

4:10:03.560 --> 4:10:07.200
 You balance it based on your values and it's never going to be the same.

4:10:07.200 --> 4:10:12.320
 The balance is, you know, the time you spend at work and with family when you're young

4:10:12.320 --> 4:10:15.880
 or when you have little kids or when they're grown up is all going to be different.

4:10:15.880 --> 4:10:19.280
 It's going to depend on your priorities at the point, but it's all going to feed off

4:10:19.280 --> 4:10:20.280
 of each other.

4:10:20.280 --> 4:10:23.160
 So maybe another word outside of balance is sacrifice.

4:10:23.160 --> 4:10:25.560
 Do you think relationship involves sacrifice or no?

4:10:25.560 --> 4:10:26.560
 Does he know what he's doing?

4:10:26.560 --> 4:10:27.560
 I know.

4:10:27.560 --> 4:10:28.560
 He's trolling you.

4:10:28.560 --> 4:10:29.560
 Is he trolling me?

4:10:29.560 --> 4:10:30.560
 He's a big troll.

4:10:30.560 --> 4:10:31.560
 Is he trolling me?

4:10:31.560 --> 4:10:32.560
 Never.

4:10:32.560 --> 4:10:33.560
 Lex is the biggest troll on Twitter.

4:10:33.560 --> 4:10:34.560
 Ever.

4:10:34.560 --> 4:10:35.560
 Ever.

4:10:35.560 --> 4:10:36.560
 Ever.

4:10:36.560 --> 4:10:37.560
 Ever sacrifice.

4:10:37.560 --> 4:10:38.560
 Deal with it.

4:10:38.560 --> 4:10:39.560
 Never sacrifice.

4:10:39.560 --> 4:10:40.560
 Never sacrifice.

4:10:40.560 --> 4:10:41.560
 But see, he means sacrifice in the context.

4:10:41.560 --> 4:10:42.560
 I know.

4:10:42.560 --> 4:10:43.560
 I know.

4:10:43.560 --> 4:10:44.560
 So I'm going to define it.

4:10:44.560 --> 4:10:45.560
 Yeah, yeah.

4:10:45.560 --> 4:10:46.560
 Okay.

4:10:46.560 --> 4:10:47.560
 Sacrifice in my world.

4:10:47.560 --> 4:10:48.560
 Can I say one thing before we get sidebar?

4:10:48.560 --> 4:10:49.560
 Rand had a good example when he was talking about balance.

4:10:49.560 --> 4:10:50.560
 So she was married to this guy, Frank O. Connor.

4:10:50.560 --> 4:10:51.560
 He was not a cerebral.

4:10:51.560 --> 4:10:52.560
 He was not intellectual.

4:10:52.560 --> 4:10:53.560
 That's fine.

4:10:53.560 --> 4:10:54.560
 She was in love with him.

4:10:54.560 --> 4:10:55.560
 She was a fan.

4:10:55.560 --> 4:10:58.040
 And a lot of times she'd have these conversations with her acolytes till like four in the morning

4:10:58.040 --> 4:10:59.880
 about the most cerebral topics.

4:10:59.880 --> 4:11:01.560
 And I said, he would always bring them food.

4:11:01.560 --> 4:11:06.480
 He'd stay up and kind of sit there in a corner and I go, when this was happening, was he

4:11:06.480 --> 4:11:09.800
 sitting there like, oh God, here goes crazy old Ein and I just got to be bored?

4:11:09.800 --> 4:11:12.040
 And they go, absolutely not.

4:11:12.040 --> 4:11:14.120
 He was so proud of her.

4:11:14.120 --> 4:11:15.700
 He was so excited.

4:11:15.700 --> 4:11:19.980
 In fact, when she got a lot of money from, I think selling Red Pawn, which was her screenplay,

4:11:19.980 --> 4:11:24.320
 which never produced, he told her you can buy any kind of fur coat as long as it's

4:11:24.320 --> 4:11:29.040
 Mink, he's like, you earn this, celebrate it, so that was a good example.

4:11:29.040 --> 4:11:35.120
 And that's a good relationship, absolutely. Now, sacrifice is the giving of a value and

4:11:35.120 --> 4:11:40.640
 expecting either nothing or something less in return. You don't do that in a love relationship.

4:11:41.440 --> 4:11:46.960
 Your love relationship is a sense, a trait. You're constantly trading. You're not trading

4:11:46.960 --> 4:11:53.280
 materially, but you're trading spiritually. Imagine if I only gave my wife, if I gave

4:11:53.280 --> 4:11:58.240
 spiritually and materially, only in one direction. I'd get sick of it. She'd get sick of it. It

4:11:58.240 --> 4:12:04.720
 would never last. It has to be in give and take constantly, in different ways, different values.

4:12:04.720 --> 4:12:10.400
 It's not a monetary exchange, but it's constantly you're giving and you're receiving and you're

4:12:10.400 --> 4:12:16.480
 giving. And that's got to be in balance. And I know a lot of relationships where that gets out

4:12:16.480 --> 4:12:22.000
 of balance. And one party feels like they're giving all the time, they're sacrificing.

4:12:22.000 --> 4:12:24.960
 They're giving more than they're receiving, in a sense. And it's over.

4:12:27.200 --> 4:12:32.880
 Now, people use the word sacrifice, like Jordan Peterson. He uses it both ways. That's a problem.

4:12:32.880 --> 4:12:33.840
 You know Jordan?

4:12:33.840 --> 4:12:37.040
 I don't know him personally. Jordan Peterson, I said. I didn't call him Jordan.

4:12:37.040 --> 4:12:38.000
 Just wanted to be clear.

4:12:38.000 --> 4:12:42.720
 Yeah. He uses it in his talks as... Sometimes he uses it just as I described it,

4:12:43.440 --> 4:12:47.840
 and he's supportive of that, like the sacrifice Jesus made. And sometimes he uses it as an

4:12:47.840 --> 4:12:55.040
 investment. But it's not. If you're giving money now, expecting a bigger return in the future,

4:12:55.040 --> 4:12:58.960
 that's not a sacrifice. That's an investment. That's why we have two concepts for that.

4:12:58.960 --> 4:13:07.120
 And the same is true if my wife is ill. And I've got a whole relationship built around what I'm

4:13:07.120 --> 4:13:11.120
 giving. It's not that I'm not getting anything back. What I'm getting back is that she is

4:13:11.120 --> 4:13:18.240
 recovering. Is that she's still alive or whatever it is that I'm keeping. That's the value that I'm

4:13:18.240 --> 4:13:23.360
 getting in return. If I'm not getting that, why am I doing it? Because I signed a contract a long

4:13:23.360 --> 4:13:30.080
 time ago. So it's not a sacrifice. Children are not a sacrifice. If I don't go to the movies,

4:13:30.080 --> 4:13:34.560
 because I stay at home with my kids, it's because I love my kids more than I love going to the

4:13:34.560 --> 4:13:39.040
 movies. And if I love going to the movies more than I love staying with the kids, then get a

4:13:39.040 --> 4:13:46.480
 babysitter or don't have kids, which is the better approach. Here's a question. What book did Ayn Rand

4:13:46.480 --> 4:13:51.280
 say is the most evil book in all of serious literature? It was Anna Karenina. And the reason

4:13:51.280 --> 4:13:54.960
 it was that book, which I haven't read, please correct me if I get the plot wrong. What Rand was

4:13:54.960 --> 4:13:59.600
 saying is the plot is a guy who's a big shot, I think. He marries a stupid girl who has nothing

4:13:59.600 --> 4:14:04.000
 of value to offer him for at all. And she ends up killing herself. Whereas Rand's version, and we

4:14:04.000 --> 4:14:09.680
 can take this out of the romantic context. I am delighted when I could be of use to my friends.

4:14:10.320 --> 4:14:15.520
 It makes me feel wonderful and not in a kind of parasitic way. It's just like that I'm at a

4:14:15.520 --> 4:14:19.360
 certain point where they call me up, they're having a problem and I've helped them with that problem.

4:14:19.360 --> 4:14:25.760
 Anna Karenina, he gives up the love of his life. Oh, is that what it is? The amazing girl.

4:14:26.320 --> 4:14:32.640
 He has an affair with her outside of marriage, taints her, is married to the stupid, but she gives

4:14:32.640 --> 4:14:42.160
 him the prestige and everything. Oh, that's clearly very anti Rand. And the smart, the one he loves,

4:14:42.160 --> 4:14:48.880
 she commits suicide in there. Okay, I got it wrong. So it's about him choosing

4:14:49.680 --> 4:14:57.760
 mediocrity and nothingness over love. So pursuing your values is so crucial. So don't take it by

4:14:57.760 --> 4:15:01.920
 saying, it doesn't mean that if you want to eat Chinese and she wants to eat Italian, you don't

4:15:01.920 --> 4:15:08.720
 once in a while eat Italian on that day, right? That's silly, right? That's not a sacrifice,

4:15:08.720 --> 4:15:13.840
 not in the sense in which we're talking about. It doesn't mean don't compromise. It doesn't mean

4:15:13.840 --> 4:15:18.880
 don't compromise on the day to day stuff. It means don't compromise on moral values. You don't

4:15:18.880 --> 4:15:25.200
 compromise on the big stuff and you never sacrifice. And that way you have a relationship

4:15:25.200 --> 4:15:32.880
 that's built as equals and as you admire each other and love at the end of the day is a response

4:15:32.880 --> 4:15:41.760
 to value. If you stop undermining your own value, the person who loves you will stop loving you,

4:15:41.760 --> 4:15:48.320
 will love you less. If you love yourself less, you have to say, in order to say I love you,

4:15:48.320 --> 4:15:54.560
 you have to be able to say the I, right? You have to be somebody, you have to know yourself,

4:15:54.560 --> 4:16:01.520
 you have to have value. And so love is a profound emotional response to value.

4:16:02.080 --> 4:16:07.280
 So speaking of love and the three of us being on this deserted island for a time together,

4:16:07.280 --> 4:16:15.040
 somehow not murdering each other, let me ask you, Yaron, Michael, what is the most beautiful thing

4:16:16.160 --> 4:16:21.040
 you find about the other? So let's go Yaron first. What do you think about Michael,

4:16:21.040 --> 4:16:29.040
 that you appreciate about him? What do you get these questions from? What do you love about Michael?

4:16:29.040 --> 4:16:33.440
 Then he's going to edit it. See, that makes sense to me. I just programmed him.

4:16:33.440 --> 4:16:37.920
 Press play. It's all just a prerecorded message. So I've never met Michael before,

4:16:37.920 --> 4:16:40.400
 so this is my... That's not true. You have and you're...

4:16:40.400 --> 4:16:44.800
 I don't remember ever meeting Michael before. You're the very beginning of the new right,

4:16:44.800 --> 4:16:47.280
 is me meeting you. I'm in the book?

4:16:47.280 --> 4:16:49.280
 Yes. All right. Well, now I have to read his book

4:16:49.280 --> 4:16:53.040
 because I mean, am I presented positively or negatively?

4:16:53.040 --> 4:16:54.080
 Very. Oh, okay. Good.

4:16:56.160 --> 4:16:58.000
 Lex is not so sure. He's like...

4:16:58.000 --> 4:17:02.000
 I like that he goes, have I presented positively or negatively? I just go, very.

4:17:04.000 --> 4:17:05.680
 And he's like, oh, good. I'm like, is it?

4:17:08.080 --> 4:17:15.280
 So Michael Sharp, he's quick. He's funny, although some of the humor is beyond me.

4:17:15.920 --> 4:17:18.480
 That's a nice way of saying he's very intelligent.

4:17:18.480 --> 4:17:26.640
 Yeah. He's definitely very intelligent, but also very engaging. I think that's very engaging.

4:17:26.640 --> 4:17:27.440
 I'm a sharp dresser.

4:17:28.560 --> 4:17:32.560
 Oh, he's definitely... Well, yeah. I compliment him on stuff that's obvious

4:17:32.560 --> 4:17:34.800
 and everybody can see by the video. The sex appeal.

4:17:34.800 --> 4:17:37.200
 Let me also just comment, one thing you mentioned about

4:17:38.000 --> 4:17:42.000
 you deriving joy from being of value to your friends.

4:17:42.880 --> 4:17:48.080
 People talk to me about you sometimes because you'll do humor about various things and things

4:17:48.080 --> 4:17:52.240
 like maybe you're some kind of a crazy person or something like that.

4:17:53.520 --> 4:17:58.800
 Yeah. I know you enjoy this aspect of it, but I say that the reason I'm friends with Michael

4:17:58.800 --> 4:18:04.240
 is there's real love there. And the kind of kindness you give to your friends,

4:18:04.240 --> 4:18:10.240
 to people that are close to you, to your family is amazing, man.

4:18:10.240 --> 4:18:17.200
 So that's one of my favorite things about you. Your intellect aside, your philosophies aside,

4:18:17.200 --> 4:18:20.960
 your humor aside, I think there's a lot of love in you. That's what I really appreciate.

4:18:20.960 --> 4:18:24.720
 But enough about you. I'm actually getting sick of saying nice things about you.

4:18:24.720 --> 4:18:27.120
 You're always going to say it.

4:18:27.120 --> 4:18:27.840
 Take it all back.

4:18:29.920 --> 4:18:34.960
 Can I say one thing? You're joking, but this is something that's very key and this is something

4:18:34.960 --> 4:18:42.560
 in a random context. It is very disturbing, and this is not by accident, how in our culture it is

4:18:42.560 --> 4:18:48.960
 pooh poohed to show kindness, earnestness, appreciation, to tell someone. You see this

4:18:48.960 --> 4:18:53.520
 on Twitter where someone's like, you know what? I read your book. It's made my life a lot better.

4:18:53.520 --> 4:18:59.600
 Okay, simp. And there's a real, and this very much comes out of urban media circles,

4:18:59.600 --> 4:19:06.480
 there's this real disdain for showing appreciation, for showing happiness, for showing kindness.

4:19:06.480 --> 4:19:11.680
 And now that I've called it out, you'll notice it. But when you see how common it is and how people

4:19:11.680 --> 4:19:17.200
 can't take compliments, the effects of that are extreme and extremely negative.

4:19:17.200 --> 4:19:22.480
 I got to say about Texas, one of the things, so Austin especially, I mean, I don't really

4:19:22.480 --> 4:19:27.840
 fully know Texas, Texas, but Austin, the friendliness. There's a reason I've gotten

4:19:27.840 --> 4:19:33.440
 fatter and been drinking a lot is all the friendliness from random people who are no

4:19:33.440 --> 4:19:39.280
 longer random. They're just friends. I've made more friends in one week than I have in my entire

4:19:39.280 --> 4:19:45.600
 stay in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Exactly. One and a half. You know what the number two means?

4:19:46.640 --> 4:19:52.720
 I've never counted up that high. So this is what happens when people are free.

4:19:52.720 --> 4:19:55.200
 No. When people are free and individualistic,

4:19:55.200 --> 4:20:00.800
 it's exact opposite of what people believe. The more collectivist we are, the less free we are,

4:20:00.800 --> 4:20:05.600
 the nastier we are to one another. Individualists who are pursuing their own happiness are incredibly

4:20:05.600 --> 4:20:11.920
 kind, friendly, and supportive people. Okay. And now your task with doing...

4:20:11.920 --> 4:20:12.960
 Talk about bad juju.

4:20:14.880 --> 4:20:21.840
 To practice what you preach, is there in your soul that you can find one beautiful thing to

4:20:21.840 --> 4:20:26.560
 say about Yaron now that you guys met for the first, second, or third time, or at least in

4:20:26.560 --> 4:20:34.240
 book format? So that's an easy one. So what I like about Yaron is that I think he is taking

4:20:34.240 --> 4:20:40.480
 one of the problems with maybe more old school objectivism is that they would just use Rand's

4:20:40.480 --> 4:20:45.280
 arguments in Rand's way. And it's like, you're a parent, you're not adding anything, and you're

4:20:45.280 --> 4:20:50.800
 not going to be better than her. So you give this talk about, I think you can compare, was it Bill

4:20:50.800 --> 4:20:55.600
 Gates to who was the one who went to jail? Oh, Bernie Madoff.

4:20:55.600 --> 4:21:00.480
 To Bernie Madoff. And you make the point, you're like, does anyone here really think Bernie Madoff

4:21:00.480 --> 4:21:04.800
 was happy? Like, yeah, he's successful and he's wealthy, but does he go to bed being like,

4:21:04.800 --> 4:21:08.800
 hey, I'm a great guy? No. And his son kills himself with all this tragedy that goes with him.

4:21:08.800 --> 4:21:15.920
 So I think anyone who takes an ideology or worldview that I think is of value and adds to it

4:21:15.920 --> 4:21:22.320
 and makes it and articulates it in a new way, I think is a great accomplishment. I like how

4:21:22.320 --> 4:21:31.920
 uncompromising you are in your views of putting her views forward. And I like how you illustrate

4:21:31.920 --> 4:21:37.520
 how silly it is to argue against anarchism. So I don't really have to do any of the work.

4:21:37.520 --> 4:21:44.000
 As for you, and this, I've thought this before many times, you're the first person I met who

4:21:44.000 --> 4:21:48.400
 I come at, literally the first, other than my friend who I went to yeshiva with as a kid,

4:21:48.400 --> 4:21:53.760
 who I come at us, there was a line on friends where Ross and Rachel were thinking of dating,

4:21:53.760 --> 4:21:59.360
 right? And they go, if we start dating, it would be like the third date because they knew each

4:21:59.360 --> 4:22:02.400
 other well. And then she's like, yeah, but it'd be like, so it's like a plus and a minus, like,

4:22:02.400 --> 4:22:06.960
 yeah, you're fast forwarding to seriousness, but it's also the fact that you and I have the same

4:22:06.960 --> 4:22:12.320
 background. Like I can sit with your own or any of my other friends and try to explain it. The fact

4:22:12.320 --> 4:22:18.480
 that intuitively you and I grew up the same. And I know that we have that background in common

4:22:18.480 --> 4:22:23.680
 does create a bond because I feel even if I haven't told you certain things, you are going

4:22:23.680 --> 4:22:28.960
 to understand me a lot better than many of my friends who've known me for a long time. I also

4:22:28.960 --> 4:22:36.080
 really like how I feel. This is a very new age term, but I'm going to use it. I feel very seen

4:22:36.080 --> 4:22:43.200
 when I talk to you. I think you see me for who I am. You appreciate me for who I am. And I also

4:22:43.200 --> 4:22:51.200
 really like how, and this is increasingly common as my platform increases. So I'm very flattered

4:22:51.200 --> 4:22:56.240
 by this. You understand what I'm trying to do and you don't try to get in the way, even though it's

4:22:56.240 --> 4:23:02.080
 your show. You're like, okay, this guy's a performer. He's doing his thing. People appreciate

4:23:02.080 --> 4:23:08.960
 it. I appreciate it. I'm not going to try to drive the car. And I think some people who are who are

4:23:08.960 --> 4:23:13.200
 bad and I have not encountered this because I would shoot it down. But I think a lot of times

4:23:13.200 --> 4:23:18.960
 people have a tendency when they're hosts to try to drive the car. And it's like these things work

4:23:19.600 --> 4:23:24.080
 when we come in here. None of us prepare. You prepare by me. None of us talking beforehand

4:23:24.080 --> 4:23:28.240
 and like make it spontaneous. And the audience really enjoys that more because they know it's

4:23:28.240 --> 4:23:34.320
 real earnest and dynamic. Yeah. I enjoy having you drive the car, even though I believe you don't

4:23:34.320 --> 4:23:39.200
 have a license. And you think we're going to crash. No, I think he's, he's an extraordinary

4:23:39.200 --> 4:23:45.600
 interviewer because of all those things. He makes you feel visible. And, and he does, but he also

4:23:45.600 --> 4:23:52.160
 comes across as really honest. The questions are really questions that you seem really interested

4:23:52.160 --> 4:23:59.840
 in that you really want answers to. It doesn't come across as canned or I prepared my three

4:24:00.880 --> 4:24:07.040
 book project. Thank you. Thank you, Michael. I was pretty sure that on a desert island,

4:24:07.040 --> 4:24:12.480
 this would end in murder, but now I believe it may. Well, given his comments on anarchy,

4:24:12.480 --> 4:24:20.720
 it might still. It might still. The day is young. The night is young. This is a huge honor. I've

4:24:20.720 --> 4:24:25.280
 been a fan of both of you separately for a long time. I really appreciate wasting all this time

4:24:25.280 --> 4:24:32.160
 with me today. I love you, Michael. I love you, Yaron. We love you too. Thanks for listening to

4:24:32.160 --> 4:24:38.960
 this conversation with Michael Malice and Yaron Brook. And thank you to ground news, public goods,

4:24:38.960 --> 4:24:44.880
 athletic greens, brave and four Sigmatic. Check them out in the description to support this

4:24:44.880 --> 4:24:52.000
 podcast. And now let me leave you with some words from Karl Marx. Surround yourself with people who

4:24:52.000 --> 4:24:58.960
 make you happy. People who make you laugh, who help you when you're in need. People who genuinely

4:24:58.960 --> 4:25:05.280
 care. They are the ones worth keeping in your life. Everyone else is just passing through.

4:25:05.280 --> 4:25:14.000
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
