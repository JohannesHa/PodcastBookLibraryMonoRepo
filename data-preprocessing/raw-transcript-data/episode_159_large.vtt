00:00.000 --> 00:02.580
 The following is a conversation with Richard Crabe,

00:02.580 --> 00:07.580
 founder of Numeri, which is a crowdsourced hedge fund,

00:07.580 --> 00:09.960
 very much in the spirit of Wall Street Bets,

00:09.960 --> 00:13.580
 but where the trading is done not directly by humans,

00:13.580 --> 00:15.920
 but by artificial intelligence systems

00:15.920 --> 00:18.260
 submitted by those humans.

00:18.260 --> 00:21.060
 It's a fascinating and extremely difficult

00:21.060 --> 00:22.760
 machine learning competition

00:22.760 --> 00:26.260
 where the incentives of everybody is aligned,

00:26.260 --> 00:29.520
 the code is kept and owned by the people who develop it,

00:29.520 --> 00:33.720
 the data, anonymized data is very well organized

00:33.720 --> 00:35.600
 and made freely available.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.980
 I think this kind of idea has a chance to change

00:38.980 --> 00:40.400
 the nature of stock trading

00:40.400 --> 00:42.600
 and even just money management in general

00:42.600 --> 00:47.440
 by empowering people who are interested in trading stocks

00:47.440 --> 00:50.280
 with the modern and quickly advancing tools

00:50.280 --> 00:51.780
 of machine learning.

00:51.780 --> 00:54.120
 Quick mention of our sponsors,

01:08.640 --> 01:11.240
 As a side note, let me say that this whole set of events

01:11.240 --> 01:14.400
 around GameStop and Wall Street Bets

01:14.400 --> 01:18.720
 has been really inspiring to me as a demonstration

01:18.720 --> 01:20.960
 that a distributed system,

01:20.960 --> 01:24.120
 a large number of regular people

01:24.120 --> 01:26.520
 are able to coordinate and collaborate

01:26.520 --> 01:31.520
 in taking on the elite centralized power structures,

01:32.760 --> 01:35.220
 especially when those elites are misbehaving.

01:36.240 --> 01:39.360
 I believe that power in as many cases as possible

01:39.360 --> 01:40.800
 should be distributed.

01:40.800 --> 01:44.860
 And in this case, the internet, as it is for many cases,

01:44.860 --> 01:48.640
 is the fundamental enabler of that power.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.740
 And at the core, what the internet

01:50.740 --> 01:53.960
 in its distributed nature represents is freedom.

01:53.960 --> 01:55.960
 Of course, the thing about freedom

01:55.960 --> 02:00.960
 is it enables chaos or progress, or sometimes both.

02:02.480 --> 02:04.400
 And that's kind of the point of the thing.

02:04.400 --> 02:09.160
 Freedom is empowering, but ultimately unpredictable.

02:09.160 --> 02:12.520
 And I think in the end, freedom wins.

02:23.340 --> 02:27.180
 And now, here's my conversation with Richard Crabe.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.880
 From your perspective, can you summarize

02:29.880 --> 02:32.720
 the important events around this amazing saga

02:32.720 --> 02:34.960
 that we've been living through of Wall Street Bets,

02:34.960 --> 02:38.160
 the subreddit and GameStop, and in general,

02:38.160 --> 02:39.720
 just what are your thoughts about it

02:39.720 --> 02:42.120
 from a technical to the philosophical level?

02:42.120 --> 02:42.960
 I think it's amazing.

02:42.960 --> 02:44.940
 It's like my favorite story ever.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.760
 Like when I was reading about it,

02:47.760 --> 02:49.380
 I was like, this is the best.

02:49.380 --> 02:53.780
 And it's also connected with my company,

02:53.780 --> 02:54.740
 which we can talk about.

02:54.740 --> 02:57.020
 But what I liked about it is like,

02:57.020 --> 02:59.420
 I like decentralized coordination

02:59.420 --> 03:01.500
 and looking at the mechanisms

03:01.500 --> 03:04.860
 that these are Wall Street Bets users use

03:04.860 --> 03:08.180
 to hype each other up, to get excited,

03:08.180 --> 03:11.080
 to prove that they bought the stock and they're holding.

03:12.100 --> 03:15.940
 And then also to see that how big of an impact

03:15.940 --> 03:18.000
 that that decentralized coordination had.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.240
 So it really was a big deal.

03:21.240 --> 03:24.420
 Were you impressed by the distributed coordination,

03:24.420 --> 03:26.400
 the collaboration amongst like,

03:26.400 --> 03:27.480
 I don't know what the numbers are.

03:27.480 --> 03:30.480
 I know I'm numerized looking at the data.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.640
 After all of this is over and done,

03:32.640 --> 03:34.440
 it'd be interesting to see like

03:34.440 --> 03:38.200
 from a large scale distributed system perspective

03:38.200 --> 03:40.340
 to see how everything played out.

03:40.340 --> 03:44.160
 But just from your current perspective, what we know,

03:44.160 --> 03:47.640
 is it obvious to you that such incredible level

03:47.640 --> 03:49.920
 of coordination could happen

03:49.920 --> 03:52.780
 where a lot of people come together in a distributed sense,

03:52.780 --> 03:54.960
 there's an emergent behavior that happens after that.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.400
 No, it's not at all obvious.

03:57.400 --> 04:01.760
 And one of the reasons is the lack of credibility.

04:01.760 --> 04:02.740
 To coordinate with someone,

04:02.740 --> 04:06.600
 you need to make credible contracts or credible claims.

04:06.600 --> 04:11.600
 So if you have a username on our Wall Street Bets,

04:11.620 --> 04:14.700
 like some of them are, like deep fucking value

04:14.700 --> 04:15.540
 is one of them.

04:15.540 --> 04:16.580
 That's an actual username.

04:16.580 --> 04:18.240
 By the way, we're talking about,

04:18.240 --> 04:19.600
 there's a website called Reddit

04:19.600 --> 04:21.120
 and there's subreddits on it.

04:21.120 --> 04:24.120
 And a lot of people, mostly anonymous,

04:24.120 --> 04:27.080
 I think for the most part anonymous,

04:27.080 --> 04:28.260
 can create user accounts

04:28.260 --> 04:31.240
 and then can then just talk on forum like style boards.

04:31.240 --> 04:32.340
 You should know what Reddit is.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.920
 If you don't know what Reddit is, check it out.

04:34.920 --> 04:36.040
 If you don't know what Reddit is,

04:36.040 --> 04:40.560
 maybe go to the awesome subreddit first,

04:40.560 --> 04:43.120
 aww with cute pictures of cats and dogs.

04:43.120 --> 04:44.080
 That's my recommendation.

04:44.080 --> 04:44.920
 Anyway.

04:44.920 --> 04:46.140
 Okay, yeah, that would be a good start to Reddit.

04:46.140 --> 04:48.960
 When you get into it more, go to our Wall Street Bets.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.960
 It gets dark quickly.

04:50.960 --> 04:53.060
 We'll probably talk about that too.

04:53.060 --> 04:56.240
 So yeah, so there's these users

04:56.240 --> 04:58.200
 and there's no contracts, like you were saying.

04:58.200 --> 05:01.480
 There's no contracts, the users are anonymous,

05:01.480 --> 05:03.560
 but there are little things that do help.

05:03.560 --> 05:04.480
 So for example,

05:04.480 --> 05:07.720
 if you've posted a really good investment idea in the past,

05:07.720 --> 05:10.040
 that exists on Reddit as well.

05:10.040 --> 05:12.640
 And it might have lots of upvotes.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.840
 And that's also kind of like giving credibility

05:14.840 --> 05:17.000
 to your next thing.

05:17.880 --> 05:20.820
 And then they are also putting up screenshots,

05:20.820 --> 05:25.820
 like here's the trades I've made and here's a screenshot.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.160
 Now you could fake the screenshot,

05:28.160 --> 05:32.200
 but still it seems like if you've got a lot of karma

05:32.200 --> 05:35.280
 and you've had a good performance on the community,

05:35.280 --> 05:37.680
 it somehow becomes credible enough

05:37.680 --> 05:39.760
 for other people to be like, you know what?

05:39.760 --> 05:43.240
 He actually probably did put a million dollars into this.

05:43.240 --> 05:46.360
 And you know what, I can follow that trade easily.

05:46.360 --> 05:47.680
 And there's a bunch of people like that.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.260
 So you're kind of integrating all that information

05:50.260 --> 05:52.600
 together yourself to see like, huh,

05:52.600 --> 05:53.520
 there's something happening here.

05:53.520 --> 05:57.440
 And then you jump onto this little boat of like behavior,

05:57.440 --> 06:00.400
 like we should buy the stock or sell the stock.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.440
 And then another person jumps on,

06:02.440 --> 06:04.520
 another person jumps on.

06:04.520 --> 06:07.280
 And all of a sudden you have just a huge number of people

06:07.280 --> 06:08.640
 behaving in the same direction.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.640
 It's like flock of whatever birds.

06:10.640 --> 06:11.480
 Exactly.

06:11.480 --> 06:12.480
 What was strange with this one,

06:12.480 --> 06:15.320
 it wasn't just let's all buy Tesla.

06:15.320 --> 06:18.800
 We love Elon, we love Tesla, let's all buy Tesla.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.040
 Because that we've heard before, right?

06:21.040 --> 06:23.960
 Everybody likes Tesla.

06:23.960 --> 06:25.060
 Well, now they do.

06:26.200 --> 06:29.560
 So what they did with this in this case,

06:29.560 --> 06:31.360
 they're buying a stock that was bad.

06:31.360 --> 06:33.440
 They're buying it because it was bad.

06:33.440 --> 06:36.240
 And that's really weird because that's a little bit

06:37.240 --> 06:41.340
 too galaxy brain for a decentralized community.

06:41.340 --> 06:43.220
 How did they come up with it?

06:43.220 --> 06:44.820
 How did they know that was the right one?

06:44.820 --> 06:46.580
 And the reason they liked it

06:46.580 --> 06:49.860
 is because it had really, really high short interest.

06:49.860 --> 06:54.780
 It had been shorted more than its own float, I believe.

06:54.780 --> 06:57.500
 And so they figured out that if they all bought

06:57.500 --> 07:02.500
 this bad stock, they could short squeeze some hedge funds.

07:03.260 --> 07:05.220
 And those hedge funds would have to capitulate

07:05.220 --> 07:08.380
 and buy the stock at really, really high prices.

07:08.380 --> 07:10.540
 And we should say that shorted means that

07:10.540 --> 07:13.180
 these are a bunch of people, when you short a stock,

07:13.180 --> 07:16.140
 you're betting on the, you're predicting

07:16.140 --> 07:17.500
 that the stock's going to go down

07:17.500 --> 07:19.580
 and then you will make money if it does.

07:19.580 --> 07:22.340
 And then what's a short squeeze?

07:22.340 --> 07:24.580
 It's really that if you are a hedge fund

07:24.580 --> 07:27.920
 and you take a big short position in a company,

07:28.920 --> 07:31.100
 there's a certain level at which

07:31.100 --> 07:34.780
 you can't sustain holding that position.

07:34.780 --> 07:37.320
 There's no limit to how high a stock can go,

07:37.320 --> 07:39.700
 but there is a limit to how low it can go, right?

07:39.700 --> 07:43.180
 So if you short something, you have infinite loss potential.

07:43.180 --> 07:47.060
 And if the stock doubles overnight, like GameStop did,

07:48.580 --> 07:51.900
 you're putting a lot of stress on that hedge fund.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.780
 And that hedge fund manager might have to say,

07:53.780 --> 07:56.340
 you know what, I have to get out of the trade.

07:56.340 --> 07:59.580
 And the only way to get out is to buy the bad stock

07:59.580 --> 08:02.580
 that they don't want, like they believe will go down.

08:02.580 --> 08:05.380
 So it's an interesting situation,

08:05.380 --> 08:09.140
 particularly because it's not zero sum.

08:09.140 --> 08:11.460
 If you say, let's all get together

08:11.460 --> 08:13.620
 and make a bubble in watermelons,

08:13.620 --> 08:14.860
 you buy a bunch of watermelons,

08:14.860 --> 08:17.240
 the price goes up, it comes down again,

08:18.260 --> 08:20.860
 it's a zero sum game.

08:20.860 --> 08:22.460
 If someone's already shorted a stock

08:22.460 --> 08:24.040
 and you can make them short squeeze,

08:24.040 --> 08:25.900
 it's actually a positive sum game.

08:25.900 --> 08:28.160
 So yes, some Redditors will make a lot of money,

08:28.160 --> 08:29.740
 some will lose a lot,

08:29.740 --> 08:32.500
 but actually the whole group will make money.

08:32.500 --> 08:36.980
 And that's really why it was such a clever thing

08:36.980 --> 08:38.140
 for them to do.

08:38.140 --> 08:40.660
 And coupled to the fact that shorting,

08:40.660 --> 08:42.740
 I mean, maybe you can push back,

08:42.740 --> 08:45.840
 but to me always from an outsider's perspective,

08:45.840 --> 08:48.860
 seemed, I hope I'm not using too strong of a word,

08:48.860 --> 08:51.180
 but it seemed almost unethical.

08:51.180 --> 08:54.600
 Maybe not unethical, maybe it's just a asshole thing to do.

08:55.620 --> 08:57.760
 Okay, I'm speaking not from an economics

08:57.760 --> 08:58.780
 or financial perspective,

08:58.780 --> 09:02.360
 I'm speaking from just somebody who loves,

09:02.360 --> 09:03.540
 I'm a fan of a lot of people,

09:03.540 --> 09:07.000
 I love celebrating the success of a lot of people.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
 And this is like the stock market equivalent of like haters.

09:13.060 --> 09:14.420
 I know that's not what it is.

09:14.420 --> 09:15.740
 I know that there's efficient,

09:15.740 --> 09:18.240
 you wanna have an economy efficient mechanism

09:18.240 --> 09:23.240
 for punishing sort of overhyped, overvalued things.

09:23.860 --> 09:26.100
 That's what shorthand guess is designed for.

09:26.100 --> 09:29.540
 But it just always felt like these people are just,

09:29.540 --> 09:33.500
 because they're not just betting on the loss of the company.

09:33.500 --> 09:37.340
 It feels like they're also using their leverage and power

09:37.340 --> 09:40.780
 to manipulate media or just to write articles

09:40.780 --> 09:43.440
 or just to hate on you on social media.

09:43.440 --> 09:46.500
 Then you get to see that with Elon Musk and so on.

09:46.500 --> 09:50.560
 So this is like the man,

09:50.560 --> 09:53.780
 so people like hedge funds that were shorting

09:53.780 --> 09:58.740
 are like the sort of embodiment of the evil

09:58.740 --> 10:01.320
 or just the bad guy, the overpowerful

10:01.320 --> 10:02.860
 that's misusing their power.

10:02.860 --> 10:04.140
 And here's the crowd,

10:04.140 --> 10:06.380
 the people that are standing up and rising up.

10:06.380 --> 10:10.500
 So it's not just that they were able to collaborate

10:10.500 --> 10:13.340
 on Wall Street bets to sort of effectively

10:13.340 --> 10:14.820
 make money for themselves.

10:14.820 --> 10:17.380
 It's also that this is like a symbol

10:17.380 --> 10:19.420
 of the people getting together

10:19.420 --> 10:23.380
 and fighting the centralized elites, the powerful.

10:23.380 --> 10:27.140
 And that, I don't know what your thoughts are

10:27.140 --> 10:28.580
 about that in general.

10:28.580 --> 10:32.140
 At this stage, it feels like that's really exciting

10:32.140 --> 10:35.340
 that people have power,

10:35.340 --> 10:38.200
 just like regular people have power.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.780
 At the same time, it's scary a little bit

10:40.780 --> 10:44.320
 because just studying history,

10:44.320 --> 10:48.040
 people could be manipulated by charismatic leaders.

10:49.340 --> 10:54.220
 And so just like Elon right now is manipulating,

10:54.220 --> 10:56.720
 encouraging people to buy Dogecoin or whatever,

10:58.820 --> 11:00.780
 there can be good charismatic leaders

11:00.780 --> 11:02.540
 and there can be bad charismatic leaders.

11:02.540 --> 11:04.580
 And so it's nerve wracking.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.860
 It's a little bit scary how much power

11:06.860 --> 11:11.220
 a subreddit can have to destroy somebody

11:11.220 --> 11:12.980
 because right now we're celebrating

11:12.980 --> 11:15.020
 they might be attacking or destroying somebody

11:15.020 --> 11:17.140
 that everybody doesn't like,

11:17.140 --> 11:19.140
 but what if they attack somebody

11:19.140 --> 11:21.060
 that is actually good for this world?

11:21.060 --> 11:25.940
 So that, and that's kind of the awesomeness

11:25.940 --> 11:28.540
 and the price of freedom.

11:28.540 --> 11:31.200
 It's like it could destroy the world

11:31.200 --> 11:32.640
 or it can save the world.

11:32.640 --> 11:35.220
 But at this stage, it feels like, I don't know,

11:35.220 --> 11:36.700
 overall, when you sit back,

11:36.700 --> 11:39.620
 do you think this was just a positive wave

11:39.620 --> 11:41.060
 of emergent behavior?

11:41.060 --> 11:43.280
 Is there something negative about what happened?

11:43.280 --> 11:47.020
 Well, yeah, the cool thing is they weren't doing anything,

11:47.020 --> 11:50.720
 the Reddit people weren't doing anything exotic.

11:50.720 --> 11:55.140
 It was a creative trade, but it wasn't exotic.

11:55.140 --> 11:57.700
 It wasn't, it was just buying the stock.

11:57.700 --> 12:00.300
 Okay, maybe they bought some options too,

12:00.300 --> 12:03.920
 but it was the hedge fund that was doing the exotic thing.

12:04.780 --> 12:06.380
 So I liked that.

12:06.380 --> 12:10.580
 It was, it's hard to say, well, we've got together

12:10.580 --> 12:12.980
 and we've pulled all our money together

12:12.980 --> 12:16.480
 and now there's a company out there that's worth more.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.620
 What's wrong with that?

12:17.620 --> 12:18.580
 Yeah. Right?

12:18.580 --> 12:21.820
 But it doesn't talk about the motivations, which is,

12:21.820 --> 12:25.020
 and then we destroyed some hedge funds in the process.

12:25.020 --> 12:28.180
 Is there something to be said about the humor

12:28.180 --> 12:31.780
 and the, I don't know, the edginess,

12:31.780 --> 12:34.220
 sometimes viciousness of that subreddit?

12:34.220 --> 12:36.420
 I haven't looked at it too much,

12:36.420 --> 12:40.900
 but it feels like people can be quite aggressive on there.

12:40.900 --> 12:45.180
 So is there, what is that?

12:45.180 --> 12:48.120
 Is that what Freedom looks like?

12:49.020 --> 12:50.080
 I think it does, yeah.

12:50.080 --> 12:52.380
 You definitely need to let people,

12:52.380 --> 12:54.740
 one of the things that people have compared it to

12:54.740 --> 12:58.180
 is the Occupy Wall Street, which is, let's say,

12:58.180 --> 13:03.180
 some very sincere liberals, like 23 years old, whatever,

13:03.540 --> 13:04.980
 and they go out with signs

13:04.980 --> 13:07.400
 and they have some kind of case to make.

13:08.540 --> 13:11.740
 But this isn't sincere, really.

13:11.740 --> 13:14.700
 It's like a little bit more nihilistic,

13:14.700 --> 13:18.020
 a little bit more YOLO, and therefore a little bit

13:18.020 --> 13:22.500
 more scary because who's scared of the Occupy Wall Street

13:22.500 --> 13:23.660
 people with the signs?

13:23.660 --> 13:24.500
 Nobody.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.020
 But these hedge funds really are scared.

13:26.020 --> 13:29.820
 I was scared of the Wall Street bats people.

13:29.820 --> 13:31.900
 I'm still scared of them.

13:31.900 --> 13:36.900
 Yeah, the anonymity is a bit terrifying and exciting.

13:36.900 --> 13:37.860
 Yeah.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.500
 I mean, yeah, I don't know what to do with this.

13:40.500 --> 13:43.500
 I've been following events in Russia, for example.

13:43.500 --> 13:46.140
 It's like there's a struggle between centralized power

13:46.140 --> 13:47.460
 and the distributed.

13:47.460 --> 13:50.260
 I mean, that's the struggle of the history

13:50.260 --> 13:51.740
 of human civilization, right?

13:51.740 --> 13:56.740
 But this on the internet, just that you can multiply people.

13:57.700 --> 13:59.700
 Like some of them don't have to be real.

13:59.700 --> 14:01.460
 Like you can probably create bots.

14:01.460 --> 14:05.500
 Like it starts getting me, me as a programmer,

14:05.500 --> 14:08.780
 I start to think like, hmm, me as one person,

14:08.780 --> 14:12.260
 how much chaos can I create by writing some bots?

14:12.260 --> 14:13.380
 Yeah.

14:13.380 --> 14:17.700
 And I'm sure I'm not the only one thinking that.

14:17.700 --> 14:19.820
 There's, I'm sure there's hundreds, thousands

14:19.820 --> 14:22.420
 of good developers out there listening to this,

14:22.420 --> 14:23.860
 thinking the same thing.

14:23.860 --> 14:26.540
 And then as that develops further and further

14:26.540 --> 14:28.300
 in the next like decade or two,

14:28.300 --> 14:30.580
 what impact does that have on financial markets,

14:30.580 --> 14:35.580
 on just destruction of reputations of just,

14:37.140 --> 14:41.500
 or politics, the bickering of left and right

14:41.500 --> 14:44.020
 political discourse, the dynamics of that

14:44.020 --> 14:46.860
 being manipulated by, you know,

14:46.860 --> 14:49.580
 people talk about like Russian bots or whatever.

14:49.580 --> 14:52.660
 We're probably in a very early stage of that, right?

14:52.660 --> 14:53.980
 Yeah, exactly.

14:53.980 --> 14:56.580
 And this is a good example.

14:56.580 --> 15:00.540
 So do you have a sense that most of WallStreetBets folks

15:00.540 --> 15:02.780
 are actually individual people, right?

15:02.780 --> 15:05.340
 That's the feeling I have is they're just individual,

15:05.340 --> 15:07.900
 maybe young investors, just doing a little bit

15:07.900 --> 15:10.140
 of an investment, but just on a large scale.

15:10.140 --> 15:11.180
 Yeah, exactly.

15:11.180 --> 15:13.780
 The reason I found out, I've known about WallStreetBets

15:13.780 --> 15:15.500
 for a while, but the reason I found out about GameStop

15:15.500 --> 15:17.860
 was this, just I met somebody at a party

15:17.860 --> 15:20.300
 who told me about it and he was like 21 years old

15:20.300 --> 15:23.860
 and he's like, it's gonna go up 100% in the next one day.

15:23.860 --> 15:26.020
 That we're talking about in last year?

15:26.020 --> 15:29.220
 This was probably, no, this was, yeah, a few days ago.

15:29.220 --> 15:33.300
 Yeah, it was like maybe two weeks ago or something.

15:34.260 --> 15:37.420
 So it was already high GameStop,

15:37.420 --> 15:39.300
 but it was just strange to me that there was someone

15:39.300 --> 15:42.740
 telling me at a party how to trade stocks

15:42.740 --> 15:44.340
 who was like 21 years old.

15:44.340 --> 15:49.100
 And I started to, yeah, I started to look into it.

15:49.100 --> 15:52.100
 And yeah, and he did make, he made it, yeah,

15:52.100 --> 15:55.500
 he made 140% in one day, he was right.

15:55.500 --> 15:58.980
 And now he's supercharged, he's a little bit wealthier

15:58.980 --> 16:01.180
 and now he's gonna wait for the next thing.

16:01.180 --> 16:03.100
 And this decentralized entity

16:03.100 --> 16:04.580
 is just gonna get bigger and bigger.

16:04.580 --> 16:06.580
 And they're gonna together search for the next thing.

16:06.580 --> 16:08.820
 So there's thousands of folks like him

16:08.820 --> 16:10.020
 and they're going to probably search

16:10.020 --> 16:11.580
 for the next thing to attack.

16:11.580 --> 16:14.460
 People that have power in this world that sit there

16:14.460 --> 16:18.180
 with power right now in government and in finance

16:18.180 --> 16:20.260
 and any kind of position

16:20.260 --> 16:22.940
 are probably a little bit scared right now.

16:22.940 --> 16:26.260
 And honestly, that's probably a little bit good.

16:26.260 --> 16:28.100
 It's dangerous, but it's good.

16:28.100 --> 16:31.420
 Yeah, it certainly makes you think twice about shorting.

16:31.420 --> 16:32.740
 It certainly makes you think twice

16:32.740 --> 16:35.020
 about putting a lot of money into a short.

16:35.020 --> 16:38.620
 Like these funds put a lot into one or two names.

16:38.620 --> 16:41.700
 And so it was very, very badly risk managed.

16:41.700 --> 16:46.020
 Do you think shorting is, can you speak at a high level

16:46.020 --> 16:50.060
 just for your own as a person, is it good for the world?

16:50.060 --> 16:52.140
 Is it good for markets?

16:52.140 --> 16:55.180
 I do think that the two kinds of shorting,

16:55.180 --> 16:59.460
 evil shorting and chill shorting.

17:00.860 --> 17:04.500
 Evil shorting is what Melvin Capital was doing.

17:04.500 --> 17:08.780
 And it's like, you put a huge position down,

17:08.780 --> 17:10.780
 you get all your buddies to also short it

17:10.780 --> 17:12.420
 and you start making press

17:12.420 --> 17:16.660
 and trying to bring this company down.

17:16.660 --> 17:19.340
 And I don't think in some cases,

17:20.420 --> 17:22.380
 you go out after like fraudulent companies say,

17:22.380 --> 17:24.100
 this company is a fraud.

17:24.100 --> 17:24.940
 Maybe that's okay.

17:24.940 --> 17:27.020
 Like some, but they weren't even saying,

17:27.020 --> 17:29.140
 they're just saying it's a bad company

17:29.140 --> 17:30.940
 and we're going to bring it to the ground,

17:30.940 --> 17:32.020
 bring it to its knees.

17:32.020 --> 17:37.020
 So a quant fund like Numerai,

17:37.100 --> 17:39.100
 we always have lots of positions

17:39.100 --> 17:40.260
 and we never have a position

17:40.260 --> 17:43.420
 that's like more than 1% of our fund.

17:43.420 --> 17:48.260
 So we actually have right now, 250 shorts.

17:48.260 --> 17:52.060
 I don't know any of them except for one

17:52.060 --> 17:53.940
 because it was one of the meme stocks.

17:53.940 --> 17:58.940
 But we shorting them not to make them go,

17:58.940 --> 18:01.460
 we don't even want them to go down necessarily.

18:01.460 --> 18:03.180
 That doesn't sound a bit strange that I say that,

18:03.180 --> 18:08.180
 but we just want them to not go up as much as our longs.

18:09.420 --> 18:13.420
 So by shorting a little bit,

18:13.420 --> 18:15.060
 we can actually go long more

18:15.060 --> 18:16.780
 in the things we do believe in.

18:16.780 --> 18:19.500
 So when we were going long in Tesla,

18:19.500 --> 18:22.020
 we could do it with more money than we had

18:22.020 --> 18:24.860
 because we would borrow from banks

18:24.860 --> 18:27.380
 who would lend us money to go down.

18:27.380 --> 18:32.220
 Who would lend us money because we had longs and shorts,

18:32.220 --> 18:34.660
 because we didn't have market exposure,

18:34.660 --> 18:35.780
 we didn't have market risk.

18:35.780 --> 18:37.380
 And so I think that's a good thing

18:37.380 --> 18:41.060
 because that means we can short the oil companies

18:41.060 --> 18:44.180
 and go long Tesla and make the future come forward faster.

18:44.180 --> 18:46.180
 And I do think that's not a bad thing.

18:47.180 --> 18:51.060
 So we've talked about this incredible distributed system

18:51.060 --> 18:52.580
 created by Wall Street Bets.

18:52.580 --> 18:56.940
 And then there's a platform which is Robinhood,

18:56.940 --> 18:59.340
 which allows investors to efficiently as far,

18:59.340 --> 19:00.500
 you can correct me if I'm wrong,

19:00.500 --> 19:04.220
 but there's those and there's others in this new MRI

19:04.220 --> 19:09.220
 that allow you to make it accessible for people to invest.

19:09.580 --> 19:14.580
 But that said, Robinhood was in a centralized way

19:15.700 --> 19:17.740
 applied its power to restrict trading

19:17.740 --> 19:19.900
 on the stocks that we're referring to.

19:19.900 --> 19:21.860
 Do you have a thoughts on actually

19:21.860 --> 19:23.940
 like the things that happened?

19:23.940 --> 19:26.580
 I don't know how much you were paying attention

19:26.580 --> 19:30.420
 to sort of the shadiness around the whole thing.

19:30.420 --> 19:32.540
 Do you think it was forced to do it?

19:32.540 --> 19:34.420
 Or was there something shady going on?

19:34.420 --> 19:36.060
 What are your thoughts in general?

19:36.060 --> 19:39.860
 Well, I think I wanna see the alternate history.

19:39.860 --> 19:43.020
 Like I wanna see the counterfactual history

19:43.020 --> 19:44.740
 of them not doing that.

19:44.740 --> 19:47.980
 How bad would it have gotten for hedge funds?

19:47.980 --> 19:50.220
 How much more damage could have been done

19:50.220 --> 19:53.400
 if the momentum of these short squeezes could continue?

19:53.400 --> 19:57.240
 What happens when there are short squeezes,

19:57.240 --> 20:00.520
 even if they're in a few stocks,

20:00.520 --> 20:02.920
 they affect kind of all the other shorts too.

20:02.920 --> 20:05.680
 And suddenly brokers are saying things like,

20:05.680 --> 20:07.400
 you need to put up more collateral.

20:07.400 --> 20:12.080
 So we had a short, it wasn't GameStop luckily,

20:12.080 --> 20:15.440
 it was Blackberry and it went up like 100% in a day.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.640
 It was one of these meme stocks, super bad company.

20:17.640 --> 20:19.720
 The AIs don't like it, okay?

20:19.720 --> 20:21.240
 The AIs think it's going down.

20:21.240 --> 20:22.400
 What's a meme stock?

20:22.400 --> 20:26.360
 A meme stock is kind of a new term for these stocks

20:26.360 --> 20:30.360
 that catch memetic momentum on Reddit.

20:32.080 --> 20:36.080
 And so the meme stocks were GameStop, the biggest one,

20:36.080 --> 20:39.440
 GameStonk, as Elon calls it, AMC.

20:39.440 --> 20:44.440
 And Blackberry was one, Nokia was one.

20:44.880 --> 20:47.960
 So these are high short interest stocks as well.

20:47.960 --> 20:50.040
 So these are targeted stocks.

20:50.040 --> 20:53.360
 Some people say, oh, isn't it adorable

20:53.360 --> 20:56.280
 that these people are investing money

20:56.280 --> 20:59.440
 in these companies that are nostalgic?

20:59.440 --> 21:01.640
 It's like, you go into the AMC movie theater,

21:01.640 --> 21:02.480
 it's like nostalgic.

21:02.480 --> 21:05.040
 It's like, no, it's not why they're doing it.

21:05.040 --> 21:07.000
 It's that they had a lot of short interest.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.320
 That was the main thing.

21:08.320 --> 21:11.520
 And so there were high chance of short squeeze.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.040
 In saying, I would love to see an alternate history,

21:14.040 --> 21:16.080
 do you have a sense that that,

21:17.080 --> 21:19.840
 what is your prediction of what that history would look like?

21:19.840 --> 21:23.040
 Well, you wouldn't have needed very many more days

21:23.040 --> 21:27.560
 of that kind of chaos to hurt hedge funds.

21:28.440 --> 21:31.880
 I think it's underrated how damaging it could have been.

21:32.840 --> 21:37.360
 Because when your shorts go up,

21:38.440 --> 21:40.520
 your collateral requirements for them go up.

21:40.520 --> 21:41.880
 It's similar to Robinhood.

21:41.880 --> 21:46.080
 Like we have a prime broker that says, said to us,

21:46.080 --> 21:51.080
 you need to put up like $40 per $100 of short exposure.

21:51.480 --> 21:52.560
 And then the next day they said,

21:52.560 --> 21:56.480
 actually you have to put up all of it, 100%.

21:56.480 --> 21:57.600
 And we were like, what?

21:58.960 --> 22:02.440
 But if that happens to all the short,

22:02.440 --> 22:05.560
 all the commonly held hedge fund shorts,

22:05.560 --> 22:08.320
 because they're all kind of holding the same things.

22:08.320 --> 22:13.320
 If that happens, not only do you have to cover the short,

22:13.320 --> 22:16.160
 which means you're buying the bad companies,

22:16.160 --> 22:18.720
 you need to sell your good companies

22:18.720 --> 22:20.880
 in order to cover the short.

22:20.880 --> 22:23.640
 So suddenly like all the good companies,

22:23.640 --> 22:26.200
 all the ones that the hedge funds like are coming down

22:26.200 --> 22:29.920
 and all the ones that the hedge funds hate are going up

22:29.920 --> 22:33.920
 in a cascading way.

22:33.920 --> 22:37.120
 So I believe that if you could have had a few more days

22:37.120 --> 22:40.840
 of GameStop doubling, AMC doubling,

22:40.840 --> 22:45.480
 you would have had more and more hedge fund deleveraging.

22:45.480 --> 22:48.360
 But so hedge funds, I mean, they get a lot of shit,

22:48.360 --> 22:51.320
 but they, do you have a sense

22:51.320 --> 22:53.480
 that they do some good for the world?

22:53.480 --> 22:55.320
 I mean, ultimately, so, okay.

22:55.320 --> 22:57.040
 First of all, Wall Street bets itself

22:57.040 --> 22:59.320
 is a kind of distributed hedge fund.

22:59.320 --> 23:01.520
 Numeri is a kind of hedge fund.

23:01.520 --> 23:04.000
 So I got, hedge fund is a very broad category.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.200
 I mean, like if some of those were destroyed,

23:07.200 --> 23:08.880
 would that be good for the world?

23:08.880 --> 23:11.960
 Or would there be coupled

23:11.960 --> 23:15.160
 with the destroying the evil shorting,

23:15.160 --> 23:16.640
 would there be just a lot of pain

23:16.640 --> 23:18.960
 in terms of investment in good companies?

23:18.960 --> 23:21.360
 Yeah, a thing I like to tell people

23:21.360 --> 23:23.680
 if they hate hedge funds is,

23:23.680 --> 23:27.960
 I don't think you want to rerun American economic history

23:27.960 --> 23:29.680
 without hedge funds.

23:29.680 --> 23:34.000
 So on mass they're, yeah, they're good.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.040
 Yeah, you really wouldn't want to.

23:36.040 --> 23:38.640
 Because hedge funds are kind of like picking up,

23:38.640 --> 23:41.200
 they're making liquidity, right, in stocks.

23:41.200 --> 23:45.520
 And so if you love venture capitalists,

23:45.520 --> 23:48.320
 they're investing in new technology, it's so good.

23:48.320 --> 23:50.560
 You have to also kind of like hedge funds

23:50.560 --> 23:54.040
 because they're the reason venture capitalists exist

23:54.040 --> 23:56.520
 because their companies can have a liquidity event

23:56.520 --> 23:58.960
 when they go to the public markets.

23:58.960 --> 24:01.960
 So it's kind of essential that we have them.

24:01.960 --> 24:04.440
 There are many different kinds of them.

24:04.440 --> 24:06.240
 I believe we could maybe get away

24:06.240 --> 24:09.600
 with only having an AI hedge fund.

24:11.560 --> 24:13.120
 But we don't necessarily need

24:13.120 --> 24:15.280
 these evil billions type hedge funds

24:15.280 --> 24:18.600
 that make the media and try to kill companies.

24:18.600 --> 24:20.160
 But we definitely need hedge funds.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.760
 Maybe from your perspective,

24:21.760 --> 24:26.760
 because you run such an organization

24:27.360 --> 24:30.760
 and Vlad, the CEO of Robinhood,

24:30.760 --> 24:32.720
 sort of had to make decisions really quickly,

24:32.720 --> 24:33.680
 probably had to wake up

24:33.680 --> 24:36.920
 in the middle of the night kind of thing.

24:36.920 --> 24:40.680
 And he also had a conversation with Elon Musk on Clubhouse,

24:40.680 --> 24:42.360
 which I just signed up for.

24:42.360 --> 24:43.560
 It was a fascinating,

24:43.560 --> 24:47.480
 one of the great journalistic performances of our time

24:47.480 --> 24:49.080
 with Elon Musk.

24:49.080 --> 24:51.080
 Pull a surprise for Elon.

24:51.080 --> 24:53.880
 How hilarious would it be if he gets a pull a surprise?

24:55.880 --> 24:58.240
 And then his Wikipedia would be like journalist

24:58.240 --> 25:00.360
 and part time entrepreneur.

25:00.360 --> 25:01.200
 Business magnate.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.840
 Business magnate.

25:02.840 --> 25:05.520
 As you know, I don't know if you can comment

25:05.520 --> 25:06.720
 on any aspects of that,

25:06.720 --> 25:08.600
 but like, if you were Vlad,

25:08.600 --> 25:10.080
 how would you do things differently?

25:10.080 --> 25:13.320
 What are your thoughts about his interaction with Elon?

25:13.320 --> 25:15.640
 How he should have played it differently?

25:15.640 --> 25:19.400
 Like, I guess there's a lot of aspects to this interaction.

25:19.400 --> 25:20.920
 One is about transparency.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.240
 Like how much do you want to tell people

25:23.240 --> 25:24.880
 about really what went down?

25:24.880 --> 25:27.320
 There's NDAs potentially involved.

25:27.320 --> 25:32.320
 How much in private do you want to push back

25:32.720 --> 25:36.240
 and say, no, fuck you, to centralize power?

25:36.240 --> 25:37.560
 Whatever the phone calls you're getting,

25:37.560 --> 25:40.200
 which I'm sure he was getting some kind of phone calls

25:40.200 --> 25:42.080
 that might not be contractual.

25:42.080 --> 25:44.160
 Like it's not contracts that are forcing him,

25:44.160 --> 25:47.400
 but he was being, what do you call it?

25:47.400 --> 25:49.960
 Like pressured to behave in certain kinds of ways

25:49.960 --> 25:51.560
 from all kinds of directions.

25:51.560 --> 25:55.760
 Like what do you take from this whole situation?

25:55.760 --> 25:58.320
 I was very excited to see Vlad's response.

25:58.320 --> 26:00.920
 I mean, it's pretty cool to have him talk to Elon.

26:00.920 --> 26:02.840
 And one of the things that like struck me

26:02.840 --> 26:06.320
 in the first like few seconds of Vlad speaking was like,

26:06.320 --> 26:10.920
 I was like, is Vlad like a boomer?

26:10.920 --> 26:13.120
 Like, but hear me out.

26:13.120 --> 26:16.200
 Like he seemed like a 55 year old man

26:16.200 --> 26:18.080
 talking to a 20 year old.

26:18.080 --> 26:19.920
 Elon was like the 20 year old.

26:19.920 --> 26:21.920
 And he's like the 55 year old man.

26:21.920 --> 26:25.280
 You can see why Citadel are NMR buddies, right?

26:25.280 --> 26:27.800
 Like you can, you can see why.

26:27.800 --> 26:30.200
 It's like, this is a nice, it's not a bad thing.

26:30.200 --> 26:35.200
 It's like, he's got a respectable professional attitude.

26:35.400 --> 26:38.120
 Well, he also tried to do like a jokey thing.

26:38.120 --> 26:41.360
 Like, no, we're not being ageist here.

26:41.360 --> 26:46.360
 Boomer, but like a 60 year old CEO of Bank of America

26:46.880 --> 26:48.400
 would try to make a joke for the kids.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.840
 That's what Vlad's like.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.760
 Yeah, I was like, what is this?

26:51.760 --> 26:53.680
 This guy's like, what is he, 30?

26:53.680 --> 26:55.040
 Yeah.

26:55.040 --> 26:56.840
 And I'm like, this is weird.

26:56.840 --> 26:58.040
 Yeah.

26:58.040 --> 27:00.480
 But I think, and maybe that's also what I like

27:00.480 --> 27:03.520
 about Elon's kind of influence on American business

27:03.520 --> 27:07.280
 is like, he's super like anti the professional.

27:07.280 --> 27:12.280
 Like why say, you know, a hundred words about nothing?

27:13.120 --> 27:15.320
 And so I liked how he was cutting in and saying,

27:15.320 --> 27:16.160
 Vlad, what do you mean?

27:16.160 --> 27:17.440
 Spill the beans, bro.

27:17.440 --> 27:19.520
 Yeah, so you don't have to be courteous.

27:19.520 --> 27:21.040
 It's like the first principles thinking.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.200
 It's like, what the hell happened?

27:23.200 --> 27:24.040
 Yes.

27:24.040 --> 27:26.600
 Let's just talk like normal people.

27:26.600 --> 27:31.600
 The problem of course is, you know, for Elon,

27:31.600 --> 27:33.320
 it's cost them, what is it?

27:33.320 --> 27:36.520
 Tens of millions of dollars is tweeting like that.

27:36.520 --> 27:39.680
 But perhaps it's a worthy price to pay

27:39.680 --> 27:42.160
 because ultimately there's something magical

27:42.160 --> 27:45.840
 about just being real and honest

27:45.840 --> 27:48.320
 and just going off the cuff and making the mistakes

27:48.320 --> 27:50.800
 and paying for them, but just being real.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.880
 And then moments like this,

27:52.880 --> 27:55.080
 that was an opportunity for Vlad to be that.

27:55.080 --> 27:56.480
 And it felt like he wasn't.

27:57.400 --> 28:02.400
 Do you think we'll ever find out what really went down

28:02.600 --> 28:05.200
 if there was something shady underneath it all?

28:05.200 --> 28:09.800
 Yeah, I mean, it would be sad if nothing shady happened,

28:09.800 --> 28:12.120
 but his presence made it shady.

28:12.120 --> 28:15.240
 Sometimes I feel like that would mark Zuckerberg,

28:15.240 --> 28:18.000
 the CEO of Facebook.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.040
 Sometimes I feel like, yeah,

28:19.040 --> 28:22.280
 there's a lot of shitty things that Facebook is doing,

28:22.280 --> 28:25.120
 but sometimes I think he makes it look worse

28:25.120 --> 28:28.440
 by the way he presents himself about those things.

28:28.440 --> 28:31.400
 Like I honestly think that a large amount of people

28:31.400 --> 28:36.400
 at Facebook just have a huge unstable chaotic system

28:36.800 --> 28:40.760
 and they're all, not all, but mass are trying to do good

28:40.760 --> 28:42.320
 with this chaotic system.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.760
 But the presentation is like,

28:43.760 --> 28:47.680
 it sounds like there's a lot of back room conversations

28:47.680 --> 28:49.640
 that are trying to manipulate people.

28:49.640 --> 28:53.400
 And there's something about the realness that Elon has

28:53.400 --> 28:55.720
 that it feels like CEO should have

28:55.720 --> 28:57.200
 and Vlad had that opportunity.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.840
 I think Mark Zuckerberg had that too when he was younger.

28:59.840 --> 29:00.680
 Younger.

29:00.680 --> 29:02.800
 And somebody said, you gotta be more professional, man.

29:02.800 --> 29:06.880
 You can't say, you know, lol to an interview.

29:06.880 --> 29:10.720
 And then suddenly he became like this distant person

29:10.720 --> 29:11.560
 that was hot.

29:11.560 --> 29:13.400
 Like you'd rather have him make mistakes,

29:13.400 --> 29:16.080
 but be honest than be like professional

29:16.080 --> 29:18.000
 and never make mistakes.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
 Yeah, one of the difficult hires I think

29:22.000 --> 29:25.680
 is like marketing people or like PR people

29:25.680 --> 29:28.320
 is you have to hire people that get the fact

29:28.320 --> 29:31.000
 that you can say lol on an interview.

29:31.000 --> 29:36.000
 Or, you know, take risks as opposed to what the PR,

29:37.200 --> 29:39.720
 I've talked to quite a few big CEOs

29:39.720 --> 29:44.720
 and the people around them are trying to constantly

29:44.720 --> 29:48.000
 minimize risk of like, what if he says the wrong thing?

29:48.000 --> 29:49.480
 What if she says the wrong thing?

29:49.480 --> 29:51.360
 It's like, what, be careful.

29:51.360 --> 29:53.720
 It's constantly like, ooh, like, I don't know.

29:53.720 --> 29:56.560
 And there's this nervous energy that builds up over time

29:56.560 --> 29:59.720
 with larger and larger teams where the whole thing,

29:59.720 --> 30:01.520
 like I visited YouTube, for example.

30:01.520 --> 30:05.080
 Everybody I talked at YouTube, incredible engineering

30:05.080 --> 30:07.600
 and incredible system, but everybody's scared.

30:08.520 --> 30:13.080
 Like, let's be honest about this like madness

30:13.080 --> 30:15.840
 that we have going on of huge amounts of video

30:15.840 --> 30:17.640
 that we can't possibly ever handle.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.680
 There's a bunch of hate on YouTube.

30:19.680 --> 30:21.480
 There's this chaos of comments,

30:21.480 --> 30:24.280
 bunch of conspiracy theories, some of which might be true.

30:24.280 --> 30:27.360
 And then just like this mess that we're dealing with

30:27.360 --> 30:30.160
 and it's exciting, it's beautiful.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.840
 It's a place where like democratizes education,

30:32.840 --> 30:34.200
 all that kind of stuff.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.920
 And instead they're all like sitting in like,

30:36.920 --> 30:38.720
 trying to be very polite and saying like,

30:38.720 --> 30:41.640
 well, we just want to improve the health of our platforms.

30:41.640 --> 30:44.720
 Like, it's like this discussion like,

30:44.720 --> 30:46.040
 all right, man, let's just be real.

30:46.040 --> 30:50.480
 Let's both advertise how amazing this fricking thing is,

30:50.480 --> 30:53.200
 but also to say like, we don't know what we're doing.

30:53.200 --> 30:56.040
 We have all these Nazis posting videos on YouTube.

30:56.040 --> 30:58.040
 We don't know how to like handle it.

30:58.040 --> 31:00.000
 And just being real like that,

31:00.000 --> 31:02.240
 because I suppose that's just a skill.

31:02.240 --> 31:05.080
 Maybe it can't be taught, but over time,

31:05.080 --> 31:06.960
 the whatever the dynamics of the company is,

31:06.960 --> 31:09.840
 it does seem like Zuckerberg and others get worn down.

31:09.840 --> 31:10.960
 They just get tired.

31:10.960 --> 31:11.920
 Yeah.

31:11.920 --> 31:12.760
 They get tired of.

31:12.760 --> 31:13.720
 Not being real.

31:13.720 --> 31:16.360
 Of not being real, which is sad.

31:16.360 --> 31:17.720
 So let's talk about Numerai,

31:17.720 --> 31:22.720
 which is an incredible company system idea, I think,

31:24.680 --> 31:26.520
 but good place to start.

31:26.520 --> 31:29.440
 What is Numerai and how does it work?

31:30.600 --> 31:32.960
 So Numerai is the first hedge fund

31:32.960 --> 31:35.160
 that gives away all of its data.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.640
 So this is like probably the last thing

31:37.640 --> 31:39.160
 a hedge fund would do, right?

31:39.160 --> 31:40.280
 Why would we give away a data?

31:40.280 --> 31:41.920
 It's like giving away your edge.

31:42.960 --> 31:46.840
 But the reason we do it is because we're looking for people

31:46.840 --> 31:49.080
 to model our data.

31:49.080 --> 31:52.840
 And the way we do it is by obfuscating the data.

31:52.840 --> 31:55.360
 So when you look at Numerai's data

31:55.360 --> 31:57.520
 that you can download for free,

31:57.520 --> 32:00.440
 it just looks like a million rows

32:00.440 --> 32:02.920
 of numbers between zero and one.

32:02.920 --> 32:05.280
 And you have no idea what the columns mean,

32:05.280 --> 32:09.120
 but you do know that if you're good at machine learning

32:09.120 --> 32:11.520
 or have done regressions before,

32:11.520 --> 32:14.640
 you know that I can still find patterns in this data,

32:14.640 --> 32:17.560
 even though I don't know what the features mean.

32:17.560 --> 32:20.480
 And the data itself is a time series data.

32:20.480 --> 32:24.480
 And even though it's obfuscated, anonymized,

32:24.480 --> 32:26.920
 what is the source data like approximately?

32:26.920 --> 32:27.960
 What are we talking about?

32:27.960 --> 32:32.360
 So we are buying data from lots of different data vendors

32:32.360 --> 32:35.680
 and they would also never want us to share that data.

32:36.600 --> 32:38.560
 So we have strict contracts with them.

32:38.560 --> 32:41.200
 So we only can,

32:41.200 --> 32:43.480
 but that's the kind of data you could never buy yourself

32:43.480 --> 32:46.760
 unless you had maybe a million dollars a year

32:46.760 --> 32:48.760
 of budget to buy data.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.600
 So what's happened with the hedge fund industry

32:50.600 --> 32:54.600
 is you have a lot of talented people

32:54.600 --> 32:59.600
 who used to be able to trade and still can trade,

32:59.640 --> 33:02.200
 but now they have such a data disadvantage,

33:02.200 --> 33:07.120
 it would never make sense for them to trade themselves.

33:07.120 --> 33:09.640
 But Numerai, by giving away this obfuscated data,

33:09.640 --> 33:12.240
 we can give them a really, really high quality data set

33:12.240 --> 33:14.800
 that would otherwise be very expensive.

33:14.800 --> 33:18.680
 And they can use whatever new machine learning technique

33:18.680 --> 33:22.040
 they want to find patterns in that data

33:22.040 --> 33:24.000
 that we can use in our hedge fund.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.080
 And so how much variety is there in underlying data?

33:27.080 --> 33:28.120
 We're talking about,

33:29.560 --> 33:31.080
 I apologize if I'm using the wrong terms,

33:31.080 --> 33:34.360
 but one is just like the stock price.

33:34.360 --> 33:36.840
 The other, there's like options and all that kind of stuff,

33:36.840 --> 33:39.800
 like the, what are they called, order books or whatever.

33:41.520 --> 33:45.320
 Is there maybe other totally unrelated

33:45.320 --> 33:47.120
 directly to the stock market data,

33:47.120 --> 33:51.320
 like natural language as well, all that kind of stuff?

33:51.320 --> 33:55.120
 Yeah, we were really focused on stock data

33:55.120 --> 33:56.560
 that's specific to stocks.

33:56.560 --> 33:59.840
 So things like you can have like a,

33:59.840 --> 34:01.880
 every stock has like a PE ratio.

34:01.880 --> 34:03.800
 For some stocks, it's not as meaningful,

34:03.800 --> 34:05.560
 but every stock has that.

34:05.560 --> 34:07.560
 Every stock has one year momentum,

34:07.560 --> 34:09.760
 how much they went up in the last year,

34:10.680 --> 34:12.520
 but those are very common factors.

34:12.520 --> 34:15.400
 But we try to get lots and lots of those factors

34:15.400 --> 34:17.040
 that we have for many, many years,

34:17.040 --> 34:19.520
 like 15, 20 years history.

34:21.520 --> 34:25.680
 And then the setup of the problem is commonly in quant

34:25.680 --> 34:28.120
 called like cross sectional global equity.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.720
 You're not really trying to say,

34:29.720 --> 34:31.920
 I believe this stock will go up.

34:31.920 --> 34:36.240
 You're trying to say the relative position of this stock

34:36.240 --> 34:41.240
 in feature space makes it not a bad buy in a portfolio.

34:41.720 --> 34:44.480
 So it captures some period of time

34:44.480 --> 34:46.040
 and you're trying to find the patterns,

34:46.040 --> 34:49.920
 the dynamics captured by the data of that period of time

34:49.920 --> 34:51.760
 in order to make short term predictions

34:51.760 --> 34:53.160
 about what's going to happen.

34:53.160 --> 34:55.720
 Yeah, so our predictions are also not that short.

34:55.720 --> 34:58.760
 We're not really caring about things like order books

34:58.760 --> 35:02.360
 and tech data, not high frequency at all.

35:02.360 --> 35:05.080
 We're actually holding things for quite a bit longer.

35:05.080 --> 35:07.800
 So our prediction time horizon is about one month.

35:07.800 --> 35:08.840
 We end up holding stocks

35:08.840 --> 35:10.760
 for maybe like three or four months.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.440
 So I kind of believe that's a little bit more

35:12.440 --> 35:17.440
 like investing than kind of plumbing,

35:17.840 --> 35:21.840
 like to go long a stock that's mispriced on one exchange

35:21.840 --> 35:26.120
 and short on another exchange, that's just arbitrage.

35:26.120 --> 35:30.000
 But what we're trying to do is really know something more

35:30.000 --> 35:31.920
 about the longer term future of the stock.

35:31.920 --> 35:33.320
 Yeah, so from the patterns,

35:33.320 --> 35:37.000
 from these like periods of time series data,

35:37.000 --> 35:39.480
 you're trying to understand something fundamental

35:39.480 --> 35:43.280
 about the stock, not like about deep value,

35:43.280 --> 35:46.360
 about like it's big in the context of the market,

35:46.360 --> 35:48.880
 is it underpriced, overpriced, all that kind of stuff.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.800
 So like, this is about investing.

35:50.800 --> 35:52.840
 It's not about like, just like you said,

35:52.840 --> 35:54.640
 high frequency trading,

35:54.640 --> 35:57.040
 which I think is a fascinating open question

35:57.040 --> 35:58.480
 from a machine learning perspective,

35:58.480 --> 36:00.880
 but just to like sort of build on that.

36:00.880 --> 36:02.800
 So you've anonymized the data

36:02.800 --> 36:05.240
 and now you're giving away the data.

36:05.240 --> 36:10.240
 And then now anyone can try to build algorithms

36:12.000 --> 36:14.760
 that make investing decisions on top of that data

36:14.760 --> 36:16.440
 or predictions on the top of that data.

36:16.440 --> 36:17.280
 Exactly.

36:17.280 --> 36:21.400
 And so that's, what does that look like?

36:21.400 --> 36:22.240
 What's the goal of that?

36:22.240 --> 36:24.440
 What are the underlying principles of that?

36:24.440 --> 36:26.320
 So the first thing is,

36:26.320 --> 36:29.080
 we could obviously model that data in house, right?

36:29.080 --> 36:32.240
 We can make an XGBoost model on the data

36:33.320 --> 36:36.200
 and that would be quite good too.

36:36.200 --> 36:40.240
 But what we're trying to do is by opening it up

36:40.240 --> 36:42.160
 and letting anybody participate,

36:43.040 --> 36:47.560
 we can do quite a lot better than if we modeled it ourselves

36:47.560 --> 36:50.120
 and a lot better on the stock market

36:50.120 --> 36:52.120
 doesn't need to be very much.

36:52.120 --> 36:54.000
 Like it really matters the difference

36:54.000 --> 36:56.520
 between if you can make 10 and 12%

36:56.520 --> 36:58.560
 in an equity market neutral hedge fund

36:58.560 --> 37:02.800
 because usually you're charging 2% fees.

37:02.800 --> 37:05.080
 So if you can do 2% better,

37:05.080 --> 37:07.600
 that's like all your fees, it's worth it.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.440
 So we're trying to make sure

37:09.440 --> 37:11.360
 that we always have the best possible model

37:11.360 --> 37:13.320
 as new machine learning libraries come out,

37:13.320 --> 37:14.960
 new techniques come out,

37:14.960 --> 37:16.760
 they get automatically synthesized.

37:16.760 --> 37:19.840
 Like if there's a great paper on supervised learning,

37:19.840 --> 37:21.840
 someone on Numerai will figure out

37:21.840 --> 37:23.480
 how to use it on Numerai's data.

37:23.480 --> 37:28.480
 And is there an ensemble of models going on

37:28.960 --> 37:33.440
 or is it more towards kind of like one or two or three

37:33.440 --> 37:35.360
 like best performing models?

37:35.360 --> 37:37.760
 So the way we decide on how to weight

37:37.760 --> 37:40.360
 all of the predictions together

37:40.360 --> 37:44.720
 is by how much the users are staking on them.

37:44.720 --> 37:46.280
 How much of the cryptocurrency

37:46.280 --> 37:48.280
 that they're putting behind their models.

37:48.280 --> 37:51.280
 So they're saying, I believe in my model.

37:51.280 --> 37:54.280
 You can trust me because I'm gonna put skin in the game.

37:55.320 --> 37:57.960
 And so we can take the stake weighted predictions

37:57.960 --> 38:01.040
 from all our users, add those together,

38:01.040 --> 38:02.240
 average those together,

38:02.240 --> 38:05.920
 and that's a much better model than any one model

38:05.920 --> 38:08.800
 in the sum because ensembling a lot of models together

38:08.800 --> 38:12.400
 is kind of the key thing you need to do in investing too.

38:12.400 --> 38:14.520
 Yeah, so you're putting,

38:14.520 --> 38:16.800
 so there's a kind of duality from the user,

38:16.800 --> 38:19.360
 from the perspective of a machine learning engineer

38:19.360 --> 38:22.480
 where it's both a competition, just a really interesting,

38:22.480 --> 38:24.720
 difficult machine learning problem,

38:24.720 --> 38:29.720
 and it's a way to invest algorithmically.

38:29.840 --> 38:33.800
 So like, but the way to invest algorithmically

38:33.800 --> 38:37.360
 also is a way to put skin in the game

38:37.360 --> 38:42.360
 that communicates to you that the quality of the algorithm

38:42.840 --> 38:46.960
 and also forces you to really be serious

38:46.960 --> 38:49.440
 about the models that you build.

38:49.440 --> 38:52.320
 So it's like, everything just works nicely together.

38:52.320 --> 38:54.640
 Like, I guess one way to say that

38:54.640 --> 38:56.600
 is the interests are aligned.

38:58.000 --> 39:02.320
 Okay, so it's just like poker is not fun

39:02.320 --> 39:04.760
 when it's like for very low stakes.

39:04.760 --> 39:05.880
 The higher the stakes,

39:05.880 --> 39:07.480
 the more the dynamics of the system

39:07.480 --> 39:09.200
 starts playing out correctly.

39:10.760 --> 39:12.120
 Like as a small side note,

39:12.120 --> 39:16.480
 is there something you can say about which kind,

39:16.480 --> 39:19.240
 looking at the big broad view of machine learning today

39:19.240 --> 39:24.240
 or AI, what kind of algorithms seem to do good

39:24.640 --> 39:27.120
 in these kinds of competitions at this time?

39:27.120 --> 39:29.960
 Is there some universal thing you can say,

39:29.960 --> 39:32.040
 like neural networks suck,

39:32.040 --> 39:34.480
 recurrent neural networks suck, transformers suck,

39:34.480 --> 39:37.680
 or they're awesome, like old school,

39:37.680 --> 39:40.360
 sort of more basic kind of classifiers are better,

39:40.360 --> 39:42.440
 all that, is there some kind of conclusions

39:42.440 --> 39:44.040
 so far that you can say?

39:44.040 --> 39:47.640
 There is definitely something pretty nice about tree models,

39:47.640 --> 39:50.160
 like XGBoost,

39:50.160 --> 39:53.120
 and they just seem to work pretty nicely

39:53.120 --> 39:54.880
 on this type of data.

39:54.880 --> 39:56.320
 So out of the box,

39:56.320 --> 39:59.480
 if you're trying to come a hundredth

39:59.480 --> 40:01.400
 in the competition, in the tournament,

40:01.400 --> 40:03.000
 maybe you would try to use that.

40:04.080 --> 40:09.080
 But what's particularly interesting about the problem

40:09.240 --> 40:11.800
 that not many people understand,

40:11.800 --> 40:14.680
 if you're familiar with machine learning,

40:14.680 --> 40:18.400
 this typically will surprise you when you model our data.

40:18.400 --> 40:23.400
 So one of the things that you look at in finance

40:23.920 --> 40:28.240
 is you don't wanna be too exposed to any one risk.

40:28.240 --> 40:33.240
 Like, even if the best sector in the world

40:33.840 --> 40:36.560
 to invest in over the last 10 years was tech,

40:37.960 --> 40:40.760
 does not mean you should put all of your money into tech.

40:40.760 --> 40:42.880
 So if you train a model,

40:42.880 --> 40:45.680
 it would say, put all your money in tech, it's super good.

40:45.680 --> 40:49.040
 But what you wanna do is actually be very careful

40:49.040 --> 40:53.360
 of how much of this exposure you have to certain features.

40:53.360 --> 40:58.360
 So on Numeri, what a lot of people figure out is,

40:58.400 --> 41:02.040
 actually, if you train a model on this kind of data,

41:02.040 --> 41:05.400
 you wanna somehow neutralize or minimize your exposure

41:05.400 --> 41:08.160
 to these certain features, which is unusual,

41:08.160 --> 41:11.840
 because if you did train a stoplight

41:11.840 --> 41:15.880
 or stop street detection on computer vision,

41:18.080 --> 41:21.720
 your favorite feature, let's say you have an auto encoder

41:21.720 --> 41:23.320
 and it's figuring out, okay, it's gotta be red

41:23.320 --> 41:25.040
 and it's gotta be white,

41:25.040 --> 41:30.040
 that's the last thing you wanna reduce your exposure to.

41:30.280 --> 41:31.440
 Why would you reduce your exposure

41:31.440 --> 41:34.520
 to the thing that's helping your model the most?

41:34.520 --> 41:36.360
 And that's actually this counterintuitive thing

41:36.360 --> 41:38.600
 you have to do with machine learning on financial data.

41:38.600 --> 41:41.760
 So reducing your exposure

41:41.760 --> 41:44.040
 would help you generalize the things that are...

41:44.040 --> 41:48.600
 So basically, a financial data has a large amount

41:48.600 --> 41:51.560
 of patterns that appeared in the past

41:51.560 --> 41:53.240
 and also a large amount of patterns

41:53.240 --> 41:55.040
 that have not appeared in the past.

41:55.040 --> 41:56.160
 And so like in that sense,

41:56.160 --> 41:59.880
 you have to reduce the exposure to red lights,

41:59.880 --> 42:02.440
 to the color red.

42:02.440 --> 42:05.080
 That's interesting, but how much of this is art

42:05.080 --> 42:07.920
 and how much of it is science from your perspective so far

42:09.080 --> 42:11.080
 in terms of as you start to climb

42:11.080 --> 42:16.000
 from the 100th position to the 95th in the competition?

42:16.000 --> 42:20.360
 Yeah, well, if you do make yourself super exposed

42:20.360 --> 42:23.200
 to one or two features,

42:23.200 --> 42:25.680
 you can have a lot of volatility

42:25.680 --> 42:26.920
 when you're playing Numerai.

42:26.920 --> 42:31.200
 You could maybe very rapidly rise to be high

42:31.200 --> 42:33.000
 if you were getting lucky.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.240
 Yes.

42:34.240 --> 42:36.120
 And that's a bit like the stock market.

42:36.120 --> 42:38.800
 Sure, take on massive risk exposure,

42:38.800 --> 42:41.040
 put all your money into one stock

42:41.040 --> 42:43.640
 and you might make 100%,

42:43.640 --> 42:47.680
 but it doesn't in the long run work out very well.

42:47.680 --> 42:52.680
 And so the best users are trying to stay high

42:53.520 --> 42:55.920
 for as long as possible,

42:55.920 --> 43:00.040
 not necessarily try to be first for a little bit.

43:00.040 --> 43:04.840
 So me, a developer, machine learning researcher,

43:04.840 --> 43:07.920
 how do I, Lex Friedman, participate in this competition

43:07.920 --> 43:09.400
 and how do others,

43:09.400 --> 43:10.840
 which I'm sure there'll be a lot of others

43:10.840 --> 43:12.920
 interested in participating in this competition,

43:12.920 --> 43:15.720
 what are, let's see, there's like a million questions,

43:15.720 --> 43:19.640
 but like first one is how do I get started?

43:19.640 --> 43:22.440
 Well, you can go to numero.ai,

43:22.440 --> 43:24.600
 sign up, download the data.

43:24.600 --> 43:29.600
 And on the data is pretty small.

43:30.080 --> 43:32.000
 In the data pack you download,

43:32.000 --> 43:33.960
 there's like an example script,

43:33.960 --> 43:37.840
 Python script that just builds a XGBoost model

43:37.840 --> 43:39.360
 very quickly from the data.

43:40.720 --> 43:44.000
 And so in a very short time,

43:44.000 --> 43:46.080
 you can have an example model.

43:46.080 --> 43:47.680
 Is that a particular structure?

43:47.680 --> 43:50.680
 Like what, is this model then submitted somewhere?

43:50.680 --> 43:52.520
 So there needs to be some kind of structure

43:52.520 --> 43:54.760
 that communicates with some kind of API.

43:54.760 --> 43:56.480
 Like how does the whole,

43:56.480 --> 43:58.640
 how does your model, once you've built,

43:58.640 --> 44:01.440
 once you create a little baby Frankenstein,

44:01.440 --> 44:02.760
 how does it then live in the world?

44:02.760 --> 44:05.120
 Okay, well, we want you to keep your baby Frankenstein

44:05.120 --> 44:06.880
 at home and take care of it.

44:06.880 --> 44:07.920
 We don't want it.

44:07.920 --> 44:10.760
 So you never upload your model to us.

44:10.760 --> 44:14.680
 You always only giving us predictions.

44:14.680 --> 44:17.160
 So we never see the code that wrote your model,

44:17.160 --> 44:18.160
 which is pretty cool,

44:18.160 --> 44:20.560
 that our whole hedge fund is built from models

44:20.560 --> 44:22.440
 where we've never, ever seen the code.

44:23.720 --> 44:27.040
 But it's important for the users because it's their IP,

44:27.040 --> 44:28.000
 why do they want to give it to us?

44:28.000 --> 44:28.840
 That's brilliant.

44:28.840 --> 44:31.040
 So they've got it themselves,

44:31.040 --> 44:34.200
 but they can basically almost like license

44:34.200 --> 44:36.720
 the predictions from that model to us.

44:36.720 --> 44:38.680
 License the predictions, yeah.

44:38.680 --> 44:40.160
 So. Think about it.

44:40.160 --> 44:43.920
 What some users do is they set up a compute server

44:43.920 --> 44:45.120
 and we call it Numeric Compute.

44:45.120 --> 44:47.280
 It's like a little AWS kind of image

44:47.280 --> 44:50.160
 and you can automate this process.

44:50.160 --> 44:51.200
 So we can ping you.

44:51.200 --> 44:53.000
 We can be like, we need more predictions now.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.640
 And then you send it to us.

44:55.520 --> 44:56.360
 Okay, cool.

44:56.360 --> 45:00.080
 So that's, is that described somewhere,

45:00.080 --> 45:02.160
 like what the preferred is, the AWS,

45:02.160 --> 45:04.880
 or whether another cloud platform,

45:04.880 --> 45:07.680
 is there, I mean, is there sort of specific technical things

45:07.680 --> 45:09.600
 you want to say that comes to mind

45:09.600 --> 45:12.800
 that is a good path for getting started?

45:12.800 --> 45:16.040
 So download the data, maybe play around,

45:16.040 --> 45:21.040
 see if you can modify the basic algorithm provided

45:22.160 --> 45:25.760
 in the example.

45:25.760 --> 45:28.600
 And then you, what, set up a little server on the AWS

45:28.600 --> 45:31.840
 that then runs this model and takes pings

45:31.840 --> 45:34.120
 and then makes predictions.

45:34.120 --> 45:37.720
 And so how does your own money actually come into play

45:37.720 --> 45:41.240
 doing the stake of a cryptocurrency?

45:41.240 --> 45:44.120
 Yeah, so you don't have to stake.

45:44.120 --> 45:45.480
 You can start without staking.

45:45.480 --> 45:49.040
 And many users might try for months

45:49.040 --> 45:50.560
 without staking anything at all

45:50.560 --> 45:54.840
 to see if their model works on the real life data, right?

45:54.840 --> 45:57.080
 And is not overfit.

45:57.080 --> 46:01.960
 But then you can get Numeraire many different ways.

46:01.960 --> 46:04.960
 You can buy it on, you can buy some on Coinbase.

46:04.960 --> 46:06.760
 You can buy some on Uniswap.

46:06.760 --> 46:08.200
 You can buy some on Binance.

46:09.240 --> 46:11.160
 So what did you say this is?

46:11.160 --> 46:12.080
 How do you pronounce it?

46:12.080 --> 46:15.040
 So this is the Numeraire cryptocurrency.

46:15.040 --> 46:16.440
 Yeah, NMR.

46:16.440 --> 46:19.280
 NMR, you just say NMR?

46:19.280 --> 46:21.800
 It is technically called Numeraire.

46:21.800 --> 46:23.560
 Numeraire, I like it.

46:23.560 --> 46:26.280
 Yeah, but NMR is simple.

46:26.280 --> 46:27.280
 NMR, Numeraire.

46:27.280 --> 46:31.960
 Okay, so, and you could buy it basically anywhere.

46:31.960 --> 46:33.080
 Yeah, so it's a bit strange

46:33.080 --> 46:34.400
 because sometimes people are like,

46:34.400 --> 46:36.160
 is this like pay to play?

46:36.160 --> 46:37.000
 Right.

46:37.000 --> 46:40.800
 And it's like, yeah, you need to put some money down

46:40.800 --> 46:42.600
 to show us you believe in your model.

46:42.600 --> 46:45.160
 But weirdly, we're not selling you the,

46:45.160 --> 46:48.240
 like you can't buy the cryptocurrency from us.

46:48.240 --> 46:49.080
 Right.

46:49.080 --> 46:51.800
 It's like, it's also, we never,

46:51.800 --> 46:56.400
 if you do badly, we destroy your cryptocurrency.

46:57.440 --> 46:58.520
 Okay, that's not good, right?

46:58.520 --> 47:00.000
 You don't want it to be destroyed.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.520
 But what's good about it is it's also not coming to us.

47:03.520 --> 47:04.360
 Right.

47:04.360 --> 47:06.920
 So it's not like we win when you lose or something,

47:06.920 --> 47:08.560
 like we're the house.

47:08.560 --> 47:10.360
 Like we're definitely on the same team.

47:10.360 --> 47:11.200
 Yes.

47:11.200 --> 47:14.200
 Helping us make a hedge fund that's never been done before.

47:14.200 --> 47:15.760
 Yeah, so again, interests are aligned.

47:15.760 --> 47:18.360
 There's no, there's no tension there at all,

47:18.360 --> 47:19.920
 which is really fascinating.

47:19.920 --> 47:21.000
 You're giving away everything

47:21.000 --> 47:24.400
 and then the IP is owned by sort of the code.

47:24.400 --> 47:25.680
 You never share the code.

47:25.680 --> 47:27.120
 That's fascinating.

47:27.120 --> 47:31.000
 So since I have you here and you said a hundred,

47:31.000 --> 47:33.480
 I didn't ask out of how many, so we'll just,

47:34.960 --> 47:37.960
 but if I then once you get started

47:37.960 --> 47:42.960
 and you find this interesting, how do you then win

47:43.640 --> 47:47.280
 or do well, but also how do you potentially try to win

47:47.280 --> 47:49.880
 if this is something you want to take on seriously

47:49.880 --> 47:51.200
 from the machine learning perspective,

47:51.200 --> 47:53.320
 not from a financial perspective?

47:53.320 --> 47:55.760
 Yeah, I think that first of all,

47:55.760 --> 47:57.240
 you would want to talk to the community.

47:57.240 --> 47:58.880
 People are pretty open.

47:58.880 --> 48:01.960
 We give out really interesting scripts and ideas

48:01.960 --> 48:03.600
 for things you might want to try.

48:03.600 --> 48:08.600
 And, but you're also going to need a lot of compute probably.

48:09.520 --> 48:12.400
 And so some of the best users are, you know,

48:12.400 --> 48:15.400
 actually the very first time someone won on Numerai,

48:15.400 --> 48:17.080
 I would, I wrote them a personal email.

48:17.080 --> 48:18.880
 It's like, you know, you've won some money.

48:18.880 --> 48:21.560
 We're so excited to give you $300.

48:21.560 --> 48:24.120
 And then they said, I spend way more on the compute,

48:26.040 --> 48:26.880
 but.

48:26.880 --> 48:29.200
 So this is fundamentally a machine learning problem first,

48:29.200 --> 48:31.640
 I think is this is one of the exciting things.

48:31.640 --> 48:34.400
 I don't know if we'll, in how many ways we can approach this,

48:34.400 --> 48:39.400
 but really this is less about kind of no offense,

48:40.200 --> 48:43.320
 but like finance people, finance minded people,

48:43.320 --> 48:45.400
 they're also, I'm sure great people,

48:45.400 --> 48:49.640
 but it feels like from the community that I've experienced,

48:49.640 --> 48:52.120
 these are people who see finance

48:52.120 --> 48:57.120
 as a fascinating problem space, source of data,

48:57.520 --> 49:01.240
 but ultimately they're machine learning people or AI people,

49:01.240 --> 49:03.520
 which is a very different kind of flavor of community.

49:03.520 --> 49:05.760
 And I mean, I should say to that,

49:07.560 --> 49:10.640
 I'd love to participate in this and I will participate in this

49:10.640 --> 49:12.840
 and I'd love to hear from other people.

49:12.840 --> 49:13.720
 If you're listening to this,

49:13.720 --> 49:15.520
 if you're a machine learning person,

49:15.520 --> 49:17.640
 you should participate in it and tell me,

49:17.640 --> 49:21.320
 give me some hints how I can do well at this thing.

49:21.320 --> 49:24.200
 Cause this boomer, I'm not sure I still got it,

49:24.200 --> 49:28.360
 but cause some of it is, it's like a Kaggle competitions.

49:28.360 --> 49:33.280
 Like some of it is certainly set of ideas,

49:33.280 --> 49:37.400
 like research ideas, like fundamental innovation,

49:37.400 --> 49:40.000
 but I'm sure some of it is like deeply understanding,

49:40.000 --> 49:42.680
 getting like an intuition about the data.

49:42.680 --> 49:45.760
 And then like a lot of it will be like figuring out

49:45.760 --> 49:47.760
 like what works, like tricks.

49:47.760 --> 49:50.040
 I mean, you could argue most of deep learning research

49:50.040 --> 49:51.520
 is just tricks on top of tricks,

49:51.520 --> 49:55.880
 but there's some of it is just the art

49:55.880 --> 49:58.800
 of getting to know how to work in a really difficult

49:58.800 --> 50:00.560
 machine learning problem.

50:00.560 --> 50:02.000
 And I think what's important,

50:02.000 --> 50:03.520
 the important difference with something

50:03.520 --> 50:04.720
 like a Kaggle competition,

50:04.720 --> 50:08.320
 where they'll set up this kind of toy problem

50:08.320 --> 50:10.640
 and then there will be an out of sample test,

50:10.640 --> 50:12.320
 like, Hey, you did well out of sample.

50:12.320 --> 50:13.880
 And this is like, okay, cool.

50:14.920 --> 50:19.120
 But what's cool with Numeri is the out of sample

50:19.120 --> 50:20.920
 is the real life stock market.

50:22.080 --> 50:23.400
 We don't even know,

50:23.400 --> 50:25.640
 like we don't know the onset of the problem.

50:25.640 --> 50:28.320
 We don't, like you'll have to find out live.

50:28.320 --> 50:31.640
 And so we've had users who've like submitted every week

50:31.640 --> 50:36.640
 for like four years because it's kind of,

50:38.280 --> 50:40.640
 we say it's the hardest data science problem

50:40.640 --> 50:41.840
 on the planet, right?

50:41.840 --> 50:44.080
 And it sounds maybe sounds like maybe

50:44.080 --> 50:45.600
 but too much for like a marketing thing,

50:45.600 --> 50:48.840
 but it's the hardest because it's the stock market.

50:48.840 --> 50:51.640
 It's like literally there are like billions of dollars

50:51.640 --> 50:55.480
 at stake and like no one's like letting it be inefficient

50:55.480 --> 50:56.680
 on purpose.

50:56.680 --> 50:58.760
 So if you can find something that works at Numeri,

50:58.760 --> 51:01.760
 you really have something that is like working

51:01.760 --> 51:03.680
 on the real stock market.

51:03.680 --> 51:05.720
 Yeah, because there's like humans involved

51:05.720 --> 51:06.560
 in the stock market.

51:06.560 --> 51:09.920
 I mean, you could argue there might be harder data sets

51:09.920 --> 51:11.320
 like maybe predicting the weather,

51:11.320 --> 51:12.280
 all those kinds of things.

51:12.280 --> 51:16.080
 But the fundamental statement here is, which I like,

51:16.080 --> 51:16.920
 I was thinking like,

51:16.920 --> 51:19.520
 is this really the hardest data science problem?

51:19.520 --> 51:21.160
 And you start thinking about that,

51:21.160 --> 51:24.880
 but ultimately it also boils down to a problem

51:24.880 --> 51:26.720
 where the data is accessible.

51:26.720 --> 51:31.320
 It's made accessible, made really easy and efficient

51:31.320 --> 51:33.960
 at like submitting algorithms.

51:33.960 --> 51:35.560
 So it's not just, you know,

51:35.560 --> 51:38.120
 it's not about the data being out there, like the weather.

51:38.120 --> 51:40.480
 It's about making the data super accessible,

51:40.480 --> 51:43.040
 making the ability of community around it.

51:43.040 --> 51:45.200
 Like this is what ImageNet did.

51:45.200 --> 51:46.040
 Exactly.

51:46.040 --> 51:49.080
 Like it's not just, there's always images.

51:49.080 --> 51:51.280
 The point is you aggregate them together.

51:51.280 --> 51:52.680
 You give it a little title.

51:52.680 --> 51:56.920
 This is a community and that was one of the hardest,

51:56.920 --> 51:58.960
 right, for a time.

51:58.960 --> 52:03.960
 And most important data science problems in the world

52:03.960 --> 52:08.680
 because it was accessible, because it was made sort of,

52:08.680 --> 52:12.320
 like there was mechanisms by which like standards

52:12.320 --> 52:14.040
 and mechanisms by which you judge your performance,

52:14.040 --> 52:14.880
 all those kinds of things.

52:14.880 --> 52:17.360
 And Numerize actually step up from that.

52:17.360 --> 52:19.680
 Is there something more you can say about why

52:19.680 --> 52:24.560
 from your perspective it's the hardest problem in the world?

52:24.560 --> 52:26.560
 I mean, you said it's connected to the market.

52:26.560 --> 52:29.320
 So if you could find a pattern in the market,

52:29.320 --> 52:31.200
 that's a really difficult thing to do

52:31.200 --> 52:33.320
 because a lot of people are trying to do it.

52:33.320 --> 52:34.160
 Exactly.

52:34.160 --> 52:37.200
 But there's also the biggest one is

52:37.200 --> 52:40.480
 it's non stationary time series.

52:40.480 --> 52:42.680
 We've tried to regularize the data

52:42.680 --> 52:46.920
 so you can find patterns by doing certain things

52:46.920 --> 52:48.600
 to the features and the target.

52:48.600 --> 52:51.880
 But ultimately you're in a space where you don't,

52:51.880 --> 52:55.720
 there's no guarantees that the out of sample distributions

52:55.720 --> 52:59.680
 will conform to any of the training data.

52:59.680 --> 53:04.680
 And every single era, which we call on the website,

53:04.800 --> 53:07.040
 like every single era in the data,

53:07.040 --> 53:09.840
 which is like sort of showing you the order of the time.

53:12.640 --> 53:16.320
 Even the training data has the same dislocations.

53:16.320 --> 53:21.320
 And so, yeah, and then there's so many things

53:22.360 --> 53:25.880
 that you might wanna try.

53:25.880 --> 53:29.320
 There's unlimited possible number of models, right?

53:30.320 --> 53:35.320
 And so by having it be open,

53:37.520 --> 53:40.600
 we can at least search that space.

53:40.600 --> 53:42.440
 Zooming back out to the philosophical,

53:42.440 --> 53:46.560
 you said that Numerai is very much like Wall Street Bets.

53:46.560 --> 53:51.120
 Is there, I think it'd be interesting

53:51.120 --> 53:52.480
 to dig in why you think so.

53:52.480 --> 53:56.240
 I think you're speaking to the distributed nature of the two

53:56.240 --> 53:59.680
 and the power of the people nature of the two.

53:59.680 --> 54:02.280
 So maybe can you speak to the similarities

54:02.280 --> 54:06.080
 and the differences and in which way is Numerai more powerful

54:06.080 --> 54:09.400
 in which way is Wall Street Bets more powerful?

54:09.400 --> 54:11.000
 Yeah, this is why the Wall Street Bets story

54:11.000 --> 54:12.800
 is so interesting to me because it's like,

54:12.800 --> 54:14.240
 feels like we're connected.

54:15.120 --> 54:16.880
 And looking at how,

54:16.880 --> 54:19.480
 just looking at the form of Wall Street Bets,

54:19.480 --> 54:21.480
 I was talking earlier about how,

54:21.480 --> 54:23.480
 how can you make credible claims?

54:23.480 --> 54:24.360
 You're anonymous.

54:24.360 --> 54:26.920
 Okay, well, maybe you can take a screenshot.

54:26.920 --> 54:29.120
 Or maybe you can upvote someone.

54:29.120 --> 54:31.280
 Maybe you can have karma on Reddit.

54:31.280 --> 54:35.640
 And those kinds of things make this emerging thing possible.

54:35.640 --> 54:40.120
 Numerai, it didn't work at all when we started.

54:40.120 --> 54:41.680
 It didn't work at all.

54:41.680 --> 54:42.560
 Why?

54:42.560 --> 54:43.880
 People made multiple accounts.

54:43.880 --> 54:45.720
 They made really random models

54:45.720 --> 54:47.120
 and hoped they would get lucky.

54:47.120 --> 54:48.520
 And some of them did.

54:48.520 --> 54:49.440
 Yes.

54:49.440 --> 54:53.200
 Staking was our solution to,

54:53.200 --> 54:56.800
 could we make it so that we could trust?

54:56.800 --> 55:00.120
 We could know which model people believed in the most.

55:00.120 --> 55:04.600
 And we could weight models that had high stake more

55:04.600 --> 55:07.840
 and effectively coordinate this group of people

55:07.840 --> 55:10.160
 to be like, well, actually there's no incentive

55:10.160 --> 55:12.560
 to creating bot accounts anymore.

55:12.560 --> 55:14.640
 Either I stake my accounts,

55:14.640 --> 55:16.080
 in which case I should believe in them

55:16.080 --> 55:18.720
 because I could lose my stake or I don't.

55:18.720 --> 55:20.840
 And that's a very powerful thing

55:20.840 --> 55:23.120
 that having a negative incentive

55:23.120 --> 55:26.840
 and a positive incentive can make things a lot better.

55:26.840 --> 55:28.240
 And staking is like this,

55:28.240 --> 55:31.560
 is this really nice like key thing about blockchain.

55:31.560 --> 55:33.760
 It's like something special you can do

55:33.760 --> 55:35.880
 where they're not even trusting us

55:35.880 --> 55:37.560
 with their stake in some ways.

55:37.560 --> 55:40.040
 They're trusting the blockchain, right?

55:40.040 --> 55:42.240
 So the incentives, like you say,

55:42.240 --> 55:44.360
 it's about making these perfect incentives

55:44.360 --> 55:47.920
 so that you can have coordination to solve one problem.

55:47.920 --> 55:52.120
 And nowadays I sleep easy

55:52.120 --> 55:55.680
 because I have less money in my own hedge fund

55:56.680 --> 56:00.640
 than our users are staking on their models.

56:00.640 --> 56:01.680
 That's powerful.

56:01.680 --> 56:04.280
 In some sense, from a human psychology perspective,

56:04.280 --> 56:08.960
 it's fascinating that the WallStreetBets worked at all, right?

56:08.960 --> 56:12.920
 That amidst that chaos, emerging behavior,

56:12.920 --> 56:15.720
 like behavior that made sense emerged.

56:15.720 --> 56:20.160
 It would be fascinating to think if numerized style staking

56:20.160 --> 56:24.880
 could then be transferred to places like Reddit, you know?

56:24.880 --> 56:27.080
 And not necessarily for financial investments,

56:27.080 --> 56:34.360
 but I wish sometimes people would have to stake something

56:34.360 --> 56:36.800
 in the comments they make on the internet.

56:36.800 --> 56:37.840
 Yeah.

56:37.840 --> 56:40.480
 That's the problem with anonymity is like,

56:40.480 --> 56:42.200
 anonymity is freedom and power

56:42.200 --> 56:44.960
 that you don't have to, you can speak your mind,

56:44.960 --> 56:47.760
 but it's too easy to just be shitty.

56:47.760 --> 56:49.840
 Yeah, exactly.

56:49.840 --> 56:52.360
 So this, I mean, you're making me realize

56:52.360 --> 56:58.360
 from a profoundly philosophical aspect, numerized staking

56:58.360 --> 57:01.280
 is a really clean way to solve this problem.

57:01.280 --> 57:02.280
 It's a really beautiful way.

57:02.280 --> 57:05.360
 Of course, it only with Numerai currently works

57:05.360 --> 57:07.760
 for a very particular problem, right?

57:07.760 --> 57:10.280
 Not for human interaction on the internet,

57:10.280 --> 57:11.560
 but that's fascinating.

57:11.560 --> 57:13.520
 Yeah, there's nothing to stop people.

57:13.520 --> 57:17.280
 In fact, we've open sourced the code we use for staking

57:17.280 --> 57:19.960
 in a protocol we call Erasure.

57:19.960 --> 57:23.560
 And if Reddit wanted to, they could even use that code

57:23.560 --> 57:29.040
 to enable staking on our Wall Street pets.

57:29.040 --> 57:30.600
 And they're actually researching now,

57:30.600 --> 57:32.440
 they've had some Ethereum grants

57:32.440 --> 57:37.200
 on how could they have more crypto stuff in there

57:37.200 --> 57:40.360
 in Ethereum, because wouldn't that be interesting?

57:40.360 --> 57:43.920
 Like, imagine you could, instead of seeing a screenshot,

57:43.920 --> 57:49.360
 like, guys, I promise I will not sell my GameStop.

57:49.360 --> 57:50.720
 We're just going to go huge.

57:50.720 --> 57:53.800
 We're not going to sell at all.

57:53.800 --> 57:58.480
 And here is a smart contract, which no one in the world,

57:58.480 --> 58:02.480
 including me, can undo, that says,

58:02.480 --> 58:08.200
 I have staked millions against this claim.

58:08.200 --> 58:09.200
 That's powerful.

58:09.200 --> 58:11.240
 And then what could you do?

58:11.240 --> 58:12.720
 And of course, it doesn't have to be millions.

58:12.720 --> 58:14.560
 It could be just a very small amount,

58:14.560 --> 58:17.480
 but then just a huge number of users doing that kind of stake.

58:17.480 --> 58:20.160
 Exactly.

58:20.160 --> 58:21.920
 That could change the internet.

58:21.920 --> 58:23.960
 It would change, and then Wall Street.

58:23.960 --> 58:25.240
 It would change Wall Street.

58:25.240 --> 58:26.800
 They would never have been able to,

58:26.800 --> 58:29.520
 they would still be short squeezing one day

58:29.520 --> 58:32.680
 after the next, every single hedge fund collapsing.

58:32.680 --> 58:35.360
 If we look into the future, do you think it's possible

58:35.360 --> 58:39.080
 that numerae style infrastructure,

58:39.080 --> 58:44.760
 where AI systems backed by humans are doing the trading,

58:44.760 --> 58:48.200
 is what the entirety of the stock market is,

58:48.200 --> 58:50.240
 or the entirety of the economy, is

58:50.240 --> 58:54.240
 run by basically this army of AI systems

58:54.240 --> 58:57.360
 with high level human supervision?

58:57.360 --> 59:02.640
 Yeah, the thing is that some of them could be bad actors.

59:02.640 --> 59:03.400
 Some of the humans?

59:03.400 --> 59:06.080
 No, well, these systems could be tricky.

59:06.080 --> 59:08.800
 So actually, I once met a hedge fund manager,

59:08.800 --> 59:10.040
 and this is kind of interesting.

59:10.040 --> 59:14.280
 He said, very famous one, and he said,

59:14.280 --> 59:17.600
 we can see, sometimes we can see things in the market

59:17.600 --> 59:22.760
 where we know we can make money, but it will mess shit up.

59:22.760 --> 59:25.360
 We know we can make money, but it will mess things up.

59:25.360 --> 59:28.200
 And we choose not to do those things.

59:28.200 --> 59:30.160
 And on the one hand, maybe this is like, oh, you're

59:30.160 --> 59:31.920
 being super arrogant.

59:31.920 --> 59:35.240
 Of course you can't do this, but maybe he can.

59:35.240 --> 59:38.280
 And maybe he really isn't doing things

59:38.280 --> 59:43.560
 he knows he could do, but would be pretty bad.

59:43.560 --> 59:51.760
 Would the Reddit army have that kind of morality or concern

59:51.760 --> 59:53.680
 for what they're doing?

59:53.680 --> 59:55.560
 Probably not, based on what we've seen.

59:55.560 --> 59:57.600
 The madness of crowds.

59:57.600 --> 1:00:00.840
 There'll be one person that says, hey, maybe,

1:00:00.840 --> 1:00:03.920
 and then they get trampled over.

1:00:03.920 --> 1:00:07.320
 That's the terrifying thing, actually.

1:00:07.320 --> 1:00:08.960
 A lot of people have written about this,

1:00:08.960 --> 1:00:13.880
 is somehow that little voice that's human morality

1:00:13.880 --> 1:00:17.920
 gets silenced when we get into groups and start chanting.

1:00:17.920 --> 1:00:18.760
 And that's terrifying.

1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:22.320
 But I think maybe I misunderstood.

1:00:22.320 --> 1:00:25.920
 I thought that you're saying AI systems can be dangerous,

1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:28.440
 but you just describe how humans can be dangerous.

1:00:28.440 --> 1:00:30.520
 So which is safer?

1:00:30.520 --> 1:00:38.640
 So one thing is, so Wall Street bets these kinds of attacks.

1:00:38.640 --> 1:00:42.080
 It's not possible to model, numerize data,

1:00:42.080 --> 1:00:45.000
 and then come up with the idea from the model,

1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:46.920
 let's short squeak, just game stop.

1:00:46.920 --> 1:00:49.440
 It's not even framed in that way.

1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:52.800
 It's not possible to have that idea.

1:00:52.800 --> 1:00:54.960
 But it is possible for a bunch of humans.

1:00:54.960 --> 1:00:59.680
 So I think this, it's, numera could get very powerful

1:00:59.680 --> 1:01:01.840
 without it being dangerous.

1:01:01.840 --> 1:01:05.480
 But Wall Street bets needs to get a little bit more powerful,

1:01:05.480 --> 1:01:08.240
 and it'll be pretty dangerous.

1:01:08.240 --> 1:01:11.960
 Yeah, well, I mean, this is a good place

1:01:11.960 --> 1:01:17.040
 to think about numera data today and numera signals

1:01:17.040 --> 1:01:22.680
 and what that looks like in 10, 20, 30, 50, 100 years.

1:01:22.680 --> 1:01:24.520
 Right now, I guess, maybe you can correct me,

1:01:24.520 --> 1:01:28.040
 but the data that we're working with is like a window.

1:01:28.040 --> 1:01:32.320
 It's an anonymized, obfuscated window

1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:36.640
 into a particular aspect, time period of the market.

1:01:36.640 --> 1:01:40.440
 And you can expand that more and more and more and more,

1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:41.160
 potentially.

1:01:41.160 --> 1:01:43.560
 You can imagine in different dimensions

1:01:43.560 --> 1:01:47.120
 to where it encapsulates all the things that,

1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:52.080
 where you could include kind of human to human communication

1:01:52.080 --> 1:01:55.960
 that was available to buy GameStop, for example,

1:01:55.960 --> 1:01:57.640
 on Wall Street bets.

1:01:57.640 --> 1:02:00.000
 So maybe as a step back, can you speak

1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:05.480
 to what is numera signals and what are the different data

1:02:05.480 --> 1:02:07.600
 sets that are involved?

1:02:07.600 --> 1:02:10.800
 So with numera signals, you're still

1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:15.800
 providing predictions to us, but you can do it

1:02:15.800 --> 1:02:18.080
 from your own data sets.

1:02:18.080 --> 1:02:21.040
 So numera, it's all you have to model our data

1:02:21.040 --> 1:02:22.760
 to come up with predictions.

1:02:22.760 --> 1:02:26.560
 Numa signals is whatever data you can find out there,

1:02:26.560 --> 1:02:29.880
 you can turn it into a signal and give it to us.

1:02:29.880 --> 1:02:32.600
 So it's a way for us to import signals

1:02:32.600 --> 1:02:36.800
 on data we don't yet have.

1:02:36.800 --> 1:02:38.720
 And that's why it's particularly valuable,

1:02:38.720 --> 1:02:42.240
 because it's going to be signals.

1:02:42.240 --> 1:02:44.200
 You're only rewarded for signals that are

1:02:44.200 --> 1:02:47.600
 orthogonal to our core signal.

1:02:47.600 --> 1:02:50.040
 So you have to be doing something uncorrelated.

1:02:50.040 --> 1:02:55.000
 And so strange alternative data tends to have that property.

1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:57.280
 There isn't too many other signals

1:02:57.280 --> 1:03:02.320
 that are correlated with what's happening on Wall Street

1:03:02.320 --> 1:03:02.920
 bets.

1:03:02.920 --> 1:03:05.440
 That's not going to be correlated with the price

1:03:05.440 --> 1:03:07.760
 to earnings ratio.

1:03:07.760 --> 1:03:11.600
 And we have some users, as of recently, as of a week ago,

1:03:11.600 --> 1:03:14.600
 there was a user that created, I think he's in India,

1:03:14.600 --> 1:03:21.400
 he created a signal that is scraped from Wall Street bets.

1:03:21.400 --> 1:03:24.800
 And now we have that signal as one

1:03:24.800 --> 1:03:28.800
 of our signals in thousands that we use at Numerai.

1:03:28.800 --> 1:03:30.800
 And the structure of the signal is similar,

1:03:30.800 --> 1:03:33.200
 so it's just numbers and time series data.

1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:34.120
 It's exactly.

1:03:34.120 --> 1:03:37.640
 And it's just like, you're providing a ranking of stocks.

1:03:37.640 --> 1:03:41.440
 So you just say, a one means you like the stock,

1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:43.320
 zero means you don't like the stock,

1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:46.640
 and you provide that for 5,000 stocks in the world.

1:03:46.640 --> 1:03:49.600
 And they somehow converted the natural language

1:03:49.600 --> 1:03:51.880
 that's in the Wall Street bet.

1:03:51.880 --> 1:03:52.760
 Exactly.

1:03:52.760 --> 1:03:55.480
 And they open sourced this Colab notebook.

1:03:55.480 --> 1:03:57.320
 You can go and see it.

1:03:57.320 --> 1:04:00.280
 And so, yeah, it's making a sentiment score.

1:04:00.280 --> 1:04:02.200
 And then turning it into a rank of stocks.

1:04:02.200 --> 1:04:03.160
 A sentiment score.

1:04:03.160 --> 1:04:04.120
 Yeah.

1:04:04.120 --> 1:04:07.160
 Like, this stock sucks, or this stock is awesome.

1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:08.000
 And then converting.

1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:08.840
 That's fascinating.

1:04:08.840 --> 1:04:11.520
 Just even looking at that data would be fascinating.

1:04:11.520 --> 1:04:15.680
 So on the signal side, what's the vision?

1:04:15.680 --> 1:04:18.240
 This long term, what do you see that becoming?

1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:21.720
 So we want to manage all the money in the world.

1:04:21.720 --> 1:04:23.760
 That's Numerai's mission.

1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:27.400
 And to get that, we need to have all the data

1:04:27.400 --> 1:04:30.200
 and have all of the talent.

1:04:30.200 --> 1:04:32.400
 Like, there's no way, first principles,

1:04:32.400 --> 1:04:35.480
 if you had really good modeling and really good data

1:04:35.480 --> 1:04:37.800
 that you would lose, right?

1:04:37.800 --> 1:04:41.440
 It's just a question of how much do you need to get really good.

1:04:41.440 --> 1:04:43.960
 So Numerai already has some really nice data

1:04:43.960 --> 1:04:45.160
 that we give out.

1:04:45.160 --> 1:04:48.360
 This year, we are 10xing that.

1:04:48.360 --> 1:04:50.600
 And I actually think we'll 10x the amount of data

1:04:50.600 --> 1:04:55.200
 we have on Numerai every year for at least the next 10 years.

1:04:55.200 --> 1:04:55.840
 Wow.

1:04:55.840 --> 1:04:59.080
 So it's going to get very big, the data we give out.

1:04:59.080 --> 1:05:03.640
 And signals is more data.

1:05:03.640 --> 1:05:06.400
 People with any other random data set

1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:09.080
 can turn that into a signal and give it to us.

1:05:09.080 --> 1:05:10.560
 And in some sense, that kind of data

1:05:10.560 --> 1:05:12.840
 is the edge cases, the weirdness is the,

1:05:12.840 --> 1:05:16.360
 so you're focused on the bulk, the main data.

1:05:16.360 --> 1:05:18.640
 And then there's just weirdness from all over the place

1:05:18.640 --> 1:05:22.080
 that just can enter through this back door of Numerai signals.

1:05:22.080 --> 1:05:22.640
 Exactly.

1:05:22.640 --> 1:05:26.280
 And it's also a little bit shorter term.

1:05:26.280 --> 1:05:31.160
 So the signals are about a seven day time horizon.

1:05:31.160 --> 1:05:33.920
 And on Numerai, it's like a 30 day.

1:05:33.920 --> 1:05:38.560
 So it's often for faster situations.

1:05:38.560 --> 1:05:40.320
 You've written about a master plan.

1:05:40.320 --> 1:05:43.040
 And you've mentioned, which I love,

1:05:43.040 --> 1:05:46.520
 in a similar sort of style of big style thinking,

1:05:46.520 --> 1:05:52.920
 you would like Numerai to manage all of the world's money.

1:05:52.920 --> 1:05:56.400
 So how do we get there from yesterday

1:05:56.400 --> 1:05:59.480
 to several years from now?

1:05:59.480 --> 1:06:02.040
 Like what is the plan?

1:06:02.040 --> 1:06:06.280
 So you've already started to allure to get all the data

1:06:06.280 --> 1:06:11.760
 and get all the talent, humans, models.

1:06:11.760 --> 1:06:12.680
 Exactly.

1:06:12.680 --> 1:06:14.800
 I mean, the important thing to note there is,

1:06:14.800 --> 1:06:16.080
 what would that mean?

1:06:16.080 --> 1:06:18.000
 And I think the biggest thing it means

1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:22.400
 is if there was one hedge fund, you

1:06:22.400 --> 1:06:26.200
 would have not so much talent wasted

1:06:26.200 --> 1:06:27.760
 on all the other hedge funds.

1:06:27.760 --> 1:06:30.400
 Like it's super weird how the industry works.

1:06:30.400 --> 1:06:34.000
 It's like one hedge fund gets a data source and hires a PhD.

1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:36.440
 And another hedge fund has to buy the same data source

1:06:36.440 --> 1:06:37.600
 and hire a PhD.

1:06:37.600 --> 1:06:40.000
 And suddenly, a third of American PhDs

1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:41.280
 are working at hedge funds.

1:06:41.280 --> 1:06:43.680
 And we're not even on Mars.

1:06:43.680 --> 1:06:46.280
 And so in some ways, Numerai, it's

1:06:46.280 --> 1:06:49.760
 all about freeing up people who work at hedge funds

1:06:49.760 --> 1:06:52.480
 to go work for Elon.

1:06:52.480 --> 1:06:53.000
 Yeah.

1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:58.200
 And also, the people who are working on Numerai problem,

1:06:58.200 --> 1:07:00.240
 it feels like a lot of the knowledge

1:07:00.240 --> 1:07:02.360
 there is also transferable to other domains.

1:07:02.360 --> 1:07:03.920
 Exactly.

1:07:03.920 --> 1:07:08.080
 One of our top users, he works at NASA Jet Propulsion Lab.

1:07:08.080 --> 1:07:10.000
 And he's amazing.

1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:11.680
 I went to go visit him there.

1:07:11.680 --> 1:07:13.800
 And he's got Numerai posters.

1:07:13.800 --> 1:07:16.560
 And it looks like the movies.

1:07:16.560 --> 1:07:19.320
 It looks like Apollo 11 or whatever.

1:07:19.320 --> 1:07:26.120
 Yeah, the point is he didn't quit his job to join full time.

1:07:26.120 --> 1:07:29.880
 He's working on getting us to Jupiter's moon.

1:07:29.880 --> 1:07:31.920
 That's his mission, the Europa Klippa mission.

1:07:31.920 --> 1:07:33.520
 Actually, literally what you're saying.

1:07:33.520 --> 1:07:34.200
 Literally.

1:07:34.200 --> 1:07:37.360
 He's smart enough that we really want his intelligence

1:07:37.360 --> 1:07:38.480
 to reach the stock market.

1:07:38.480 --> 1:07:39.600
 Because the stock market's a good thing.

1:07:39.600 --> 1:07:40.800
 Hedge funds are a good thing.

1:07:40.800 --> 1:07:43.040
 All kinds of hedge funds, especially.

1:07:43.040 --> 1:07:45.360
 But we don't want him to quit his job.

1:07:45.360 --> 1:07:47.120
 So he can just do Numerai on the weekends.

1:07:47.120 --> 1:07:47.840
 And that's what he does.

1:07:47.840 --> 1:07:50.400
 He just made a model and it just automatically submits to us.

1:07:50.400 --> 1:07:53.240
 And he's like one of our best users.

1:07:53.240 --> 1:07:57.400
 You mentioned briefly that stock markets are good.

1:07:57.400 --> 1:08:01.920
 From my sort of outsider perspective, is there a sense,

1:08:01.920 --> 1:08:06.880
 do you think trading stocks is closer to gambling?

1:08:06.880 --> 1:08:09.480
 Or is it closer to investing?

1:08:09.480 --> 1:08:14.160
 Sometimes it feels like it's gambling as opposed to betting

1:08:14.160 --> 1:08:15.560
 on companies that succeed.

1:08:15.560 --> 1:08:17.720
 And this is maybe connected to our discussion of shorting

1:08:17.720 --> 1:08:21.000
 in general, but from your sense, the way you think about it,

1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:23.840
 is it fundamentally still investing?

1:08:23.840 --> 1:08:29.720
 I do think, I mean, it's a good question.

1:08:29.720 --> 1:08:33.480
 I've also seen lately people say, this is like speculation.

1:08:33.480 --> 1:08:35.680
 Is there too much speculation in the market?

1:08:35.680 --> 1:08:38.680
 And it's like, but all the trades are speculative.

1:08:38.680 --> 1:08:40.680
 All the trades have a horizon.

1:08:40.680 --> 1:08:44.040
 People want them to work.

1:08:44.040 --> 1:08:48.800
 So I would say that there's certainly

1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:54.920
 a lot of aspects of gambling math that applies to investing.

1:08:54.920 --> 1:08:57.360
 Like one thing you don't do in gambling

1:08:57.360 --> 1:09:00.400
 is put all your money in one bet.

1:09:00.400 --> 1:09:04.280
 You have bankroll management, and it's a key part of it.

1:09:04.280 --> 1:09:07.600
 And small alterations to your bankroll management

1:09:07.600 --> 1:09:10.680
 might be better than improvements to your skill.

1:09:10.680 --> 1:09:13.520
 And then there are things we care about in our fund.

1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:16.560
 Like we want to make a lot of independent bets.

1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:18.560
 We talk about it, like we want to make

1:09:18.560 --> 1:09:20.560
 a lot of independent bets, because that's

1:09:20.560 --> 1:09:23.400
 going to be a higher sharp than if you have a lot of bets that

1:09:23.400 --> 1:09:25.440
 depend on each other, like all in one sector.

1:09:27.920 --> 1:09:31.320
 But yeah, I mean, the point is that you

1:09:31.320 --> 1:09:39.120
 want the prices of the stocks to be reflective of their value.

1:09:39.120 --> 1:09:40.920
 Of the underlying value of the company.

1:09:40.920 --> 1:09:45.160
 Yeah, you shouldn't have there be like a hedge fund that's

1:09:45.160 --> 1:09:48.160
 able to say, well, I've looked at some data,

1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:51.360
 and all of this stuff's super mispriced.

1:09:51.360 --> 1:09:55.240
 That's super bad for society if it looks like that to someone.

1:09:55.240 --> 1:09:57.600
 I guess the underlying question then

1:09:57.600 --> 1:10:01.800
 is, do you see that the market often drifts away

1:10:01.800 --> 1:10:04.480
 from the underlying value of companies,

1:10:04.480 --> 1:10:06.640
 and it becomes a game in itself?

1:10:06.640 --> 1:10:09.920
 Like with these, whatever they're called,

1:10:09.920 --> 1:10:17.720
 like derivatives, like the options, and shorting,

1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:18.880
 and all that kind of stuff.

1:10:18.880 --> 1:10:22.720
 It's like layers of game on top of the actual,

1:10:22.720 --> 1:10:25.120
 like what you said, which is like the basic thing

1:10:25.120 --> 1:10:26.440
 that the Wall Street Bets was doing,

1:10:26.440 --> 1:10:28.680
 which is like just buying stocks.

1:10:28.680 --> 1:10:29.720
 Yeah.

1:10:29.720 --> 1:10:31.960
 There are a lot of games that people

1:10:31.960 --> 1:10:36.880
 play that are in the derivatives market.

1:10:36.880 --> 1:10:40.240
 And I think a lot of the stuff people dislike when they look

1:10:40.240 --> 1:10:42.480
 at the history of what's happened,

1:10:42.480 --> 1:10:45.600
 they hate like credit default swaps,

1:10:45.600 --> 1:10:48.040
 or collateralized debt obligations.

1:10:48.040 --> 1:10:52.080
 Like these are the enemies of 2008.

1:10:52.080 --> 1:10:54.760
 And then the long term capital management thing,

1:10:54.760 --> 1:11:00.000
 it was like they had 30 times leverage, or something.

1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:03.280
 You could just go to a gas station

1:11:03.280 --> 1:11:05.720
 and ask anybody at the gas station,

1:11:05.720 --> 1:11:08.120
 is it a good idea to have 30 times leverage?

1:11:08.120 --> 1:11:09.520
 And they just say no.

1:11:09.520 --> 1:11:12.160
 It's like common sense just like went out the window.

1:11:12.160 --> 1:11:20.520
 So yeah, I don't respect long term capital management.

1:11:20.520 --> 1:11:21.560
 OK.

1:11:21.560 --> 1:11:24.360
 But Numerai doesn't actually use any derivatives

1:11:24.360 --> 1:11:26.840
 unless you call shorting derivative.

1:11:26.840 --> 1:11:29.240
 We just we do put money into companies.

1:11:29.240 --> 1:11:32.240
 And that does help the companies we're investing in.

1:11:32.240 --> 1:11:34.360
 It's just in little ways.

1:11:34.360 --> 1:11:36.360
 We really did buy Tesla.

1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:37.520
 And it did.

1:11:37.520 --> 1:11:44.080
 And we played some role in its success.

1:11:44.080 --> 1:11:46.560
 Super small, make no mistake.

1:11:46.560 --> 1:11:48.160
 But still, I think that's important.

1:11:48.160 --> 1:11:51.200
 Can I ask you a pothead question,

1:11:51.200 --> 1:11:55.720
 which is what is money, man?

1:11:55.720 --> 1:11:59.680
 So if we just kind of zoom out and look at,

1:11:59.680 --> 1:12:02.280
 because I'd love to talk to you about cryptocurrency, which

1:12:02.280 --> 1:12:04.400
 perhaps could be the future of money.

1:12:04.400 --> 1:12:07.720
 In general, how do you think about money?

1:12:07.720 --> 1:12:10.720
 You said Numerai, the vision, the goal

1:12:10.720 --> 1:12:15.480
 is to run, to manage the world's money.

1:12:15.480 --> 1:12:19.440
 What is money in your view?

1:12:19.440 --> 1:12:22.240
 I don't have a good answer to that.

1:12:22.240 --> 1:12:25.200
 But it's definitely in my personal life,

1:12:25.200 --> 1:12:29.200
 it's become more and more warped.

1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:33.280
 And you start to care about the real thing,

1:12:33.280 --> 1:12:37.040
 like what's really going on here.

1:12:37.040 --> 1:12:39.080
 Elon talks about things like this,

1:12:39.080 --> 1:12:40.880
 like what is a company, really?

1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:43.440
 It's a bunch of people who show up to work together

1:12:43.440 --> 1:12:45.480
 and they solve a problem.

1:12:45.480 --> 1:12:47.360
 And there might not be a stock out there

1:12:47.360 --> 1:12:49.920
 that's trading that represents what they're doing,

1:12:49.920 --> 1:12:52.920
 but it's not the real thing.

1:12:52.920 --> 1:12:57.800
 And being involved in crypto, I put

1:12:57.800 --> 1:13:03.440
 in crowdsale of Ethereum and all these other things

1:13:03.440 --> 1:13:06.240
 and different crypto hedge funds and things

1:13:06.240 --> 1:13:07.080
 that I've invested in.

1:13:07.080 --> 1:13:09.840
 And it's just kind of like, it feels

1:13:09.840 --> 1:13:13.040
 like how I used to think about money stuff

1:13:13.040 --> 1:13:15.960
 is just totally warped.

1:13:15.960 --> 1:13:23.080
 Because you stop caring about the price

1:13:23.080 --> 1:13:26.040
 and you care about the product.

1:13:26.040 --> 1:13:29.160
 So by the product, you mean the different mechanisms

1:13:29.160 --> 1:13:30.440
 that money is exchanged.

1:13:30.440 --> 1:13:33.520
 I mean, money is ultimately a kind of a little,

1:13:33.520 --> 1:13:36.360
 one is a store of wealth, but it's also

1:13:36.360 --> 1:13:38.640
 a mechanism of exchanging wealth.

1:13:38.640 --> 1:13:42.680
 But what wealth means becomes a totally different thing,

1:13:42.680 --> 1:13:45.960
 especially with cryptocurrency, to where it's almost

1:13:45.960 --> 1:13:48.400
 like these little contracts, these little agreements,

1:13:48.400 --> 1:13:50.440
 these transactions between human beings

1:13:50.440 --> 1:13:56.000
 that represent something that's bigger than just cash being

1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:58.080
 exchanged at 7.11, it feels like.

1:13:58.080 --> 1:13:58.680
 Yeah.

1:13:58.680 --> 1:14:00.280
 Maybe I'll answer what is finance.

1:14:03.280 --> 1:14:06.600
 It's what are you doing when you have the ability

1:14:06.600 --> 1:14:08.760
 to take out a loan?

1:14:08.760 --> 1:14:15.840
 You can bring a whole new future into being with finance.

1:14:15.840 --> 1:14:20.240
 If you couldn't get a student loan to get a college degree,

1:14:20.240 --> 1:14:22.760
 you couldn't get a college degree

1:14:22.760 --> 1:14:23.960
 if you didn't have the money.

1:14:23.960 --> 1:14:29.840
 But now, weirdly, you can get it with, and all you have

1:14:29.840 --> 1:14:32.360
 is this loan, which is like, so now you

1:14:32.360 --> 1:14:34.360
 can bring a different future into the world.

1:14:34.360 --> 1:14:36.960
 And that's how when I was saying earlier about if you rerun

1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:40.760
 American economic history without these things,

1:14:40.760 --> 1:14:42.560
 like you're not allowed to take out loans,

1:14:42.560 --> 1:14:44.880
 you're not allowed to have derivatives,

1:14:44.880 --> 1:14:47.680
 you're not allowed to have money,

1:14:47.680 --> 1:14:49.000
 it just doesn't really work.

1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.800
 And it's a really magic thing how much

1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:56.040
 you can do with finance by bringing the future forward.

1:14:56.040 --> 1:14:58.080
 Finance is empowering.

1:14:58.080 --> 1:15:01.120
 We sometimes forget this, but it enables innovation.

1:15:01.120 --> 1:15:04.720
 It enables big risk takers and bold builders that ultimately

1:15:04.720 --> 1:15:06.160
 make this world better.

1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:09.800
 You said you were early in on cryptocurrency.

1:15:09.800 --> 1:15:12.120
 Can you give your high level overview

1:15:12.120 --> 1:15:15.400
 of just your thoughts about the past, present, and future

1:15:15.400 --> 1:15:17.760
 of cryptocurrency?

1:15:17.760 --> 1:15:19.880
 Yeah, so my friends told me about Bitcoin,

1:15:19.880 --> 1:15:23.800
 and I was interested in equities a lot.

1:15:23.800 --> 1:15:27.720
 And I was like, well, it has no net present value.

1:15:27.720 --> 1:15:29.960
 It has no future cash flows.

1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:33.080
 Bitcoin pays no dividends.

1:15:33.080 --> 1:15:36.120
 So I really couldn't get my head around it,

1:15:36.120 --> 1:15:39.520
 that this could be valuable.

1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:44.360
 And then I didn't feel like I was early in cryptocurrency,

1:15:44.360 --> 1:15:46.560
 in fact, because it was like 2014.

1:15:46.560 --> 1:15:50.120
 It felt like a long time after Bitcoin.

1:15:50.120 --> 1:15:52.320
 But then I really liked some of the things

1:15:52.320 --> 1:15:54.200
 that Ethereum was doing.

1:15:54.200 --> 1:15:57.120
 It seemed like a super visionary thing.

1:15:57.120 --> 1:15:59.480
 I was reading something that was just

1:15:59.480 --> 1:16:03.240
 going to change the world when I was reading the white paper.

1:16:03.240 --> 1:16:06.120
 And I liked the different constructs

1:16:06.120 --> 1:16:08.000
 you could have inside of Ethereum

1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:10.200
 that you couldn't have on Bitcoin.

1:16:10.200 --> 1:16:11.800
 Like smart contracts and all that kind of stuff?

1:16:11.800 --> 1:16:12.640
 Exactly, yeah.

1:16:12.640 --> 1:16:18.880
 And even spoke about different constructions you could have.

1:16:18.880 --> 1:16:21.920
 Yeah, that's a cool dance between Bitcoin and Ethereum.

1:16:21.920 --> 1:16:23.640
 It's in the space of ideas.

1:16:23.640 --> 1:16:25.240
 It feels so young.

1:16:25.240 --> 1:16:29.360
 Like, I wonder what cryptocurrencies will look like

1:16:29.360 --> 1:16:30.160
 in the future.

1:16:30.160 --> 1:16:33.680
 If Bitcoin or Ethereum 2.0 or some version

1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:35.920
 will stick around or any of those,

1:16:35.920 --> 1:16:37.120
 who's going to win out?

1:16:37.120 --> 1:16:39.880
 Or if there's even a concept of winning out at all?

1:16:39.880 --> 1:16:44.640
 Is there a cryptocurrency that you especially

1:16:44.640 --> 1:16:48.960
 find interesting that technically, financially,

1:16:48.960 --> 1:16:52.200
 philosophically, you think is something

1:16:52.200 --> 1:16:54.080
 you're keeping your eye on?

1:16:54.080 --> 1:16:55.360
 Well, I don't really.

1:16:55.360 --> 1:16:59.200
 I'm not looking to invest in cryptocurrencies anymore.

1:16:59.200 --> 1:17:05.040
 But I mean, and many are almost identical.

1:17:05.040 --> 1:17:09.600
 I mean, there wasn't too much difference

1:17:09.600 --> 1:17:13.520
 between even Ethereum and Bitcoin in some ways, right?

1:17:13.520 --> 1:17:15.880
 But there are some that I like the privacy ones.

1:17:15.880 --> 1:17:19.120
 I mean, I like Zcash for its coolness.

1:17:19.120 --> 1:17:23.640
 It's actually a different kind of invention

1:17:23.640 --> 1:17:25.560
 compared to some of the other things.

1:17:25.560 --> 1:17:29.520
 OK, can you speak just briefly to privacy?

1:17:29.520 --> 1:17:31.200
 Is there some mechanism of preserving

1:17:31.200 --> 1:17:32.680
 some privacy of the universe?

1:17:32.680 --> 1:17:34.720
 So I guess everything is public.

1:17:34.720 --> 1:17:35.200
 Yeah.

1:17:35.200 --> 1:17:36.360
 Is that the problem?

1:17:36.360 --> 1:17:40.000
 Yeah, none of the transactions are private.

1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:46.640
 And so I have some numeraire.

1:17:46.640 --> 1:17:48.120
 And you can just see it.

1:17:48.120 --> 1:17:50.040
 In fact, you can go to a website and it says like,

1:17:50.040 --> 1:17:51.520
 you can go to like, etherscan.

1:17:51.520 --> 1:17:54.640
 And it'll say like, numeraire founder.

1:17:54.640 --> 1:17:57.720
 And I'm like, how the hell do you guys know this?

1:17:57.720 --> 1:18:00.200
 So they can reverse the near, whatever that's called.

1:18:00.200 --> 1:18:02.160
 Yeah, and so they can see me move it, too.

1:18:02.160 --> 1:18:02.920
 They can see me.

1:18:02.920 --> 1:18:04.040
 Oh, why is he moving it?

1:18:04.040 --> 1:18:06.040
 Yeah.

1:18:06.040 --> 1:18:10.520
 So but yeah, Zcash.

1:18:10.520 --> 1:18:12.640
 Also, when you can make private transactions,

1:18:12.640 --> 1:18:14.400
 you can also play different games.

1:18:14.400 --> 1:18:15.560
 Yes.

1:18:15.560 --> 1:18:17.840
 And it's unclear.

1:18:17.840 --> 1:18:19.360
 It's like what's quite cool about Zcash

1:18:19.360 --> 1:18:21.640
 is I wonder what games are being played there.

1:18:21.640 --> 1:18:23.040
 No one will know.

1:18:23.040 --> 1:18:27.200
 So from a deeply analytical perspective,

1:18:27.200 --> 1:18:31.200
 can you describe why Dogecoin is going to win?

1:18:31.200 --> 1:18:32.440
 Which it surely will.

1:18:32.440 --> 1:18:34.960
 Like it very likely will take over the world.

1:18:34.960 --> 1:18:37.360
 And once we expand out into the universe,

1:18:37.360 --> 1:18:40.080
 we'll take over the universe.

1:18:40.080 --> 1:18:42.480
 Or on a more serious note, like what

1:18:42.480 --> 1:18:45.160
 are your thoughts on the recent success of Dogecoin

1:18:45.160 --> 1:18:49.200
 where you've spoken to sort of the meme stocks,

1:18:49.200 --> 1:18:55.240
 the memetics of the whole thing, that it feels like the joke can

1:18:55.240 --> 1:18:58.160
 become the reality.

1:18:58.160 --> 1:19:02.400
 Like the meme, the joke has power in this world.

1:19:02.400 --> 1:19:02.880
 Yeah.

1:19:02.880 --> 1:19:04.080
 It's fascinating.

1:19:04.080 --> 1:19:05.520
 Exactly.

1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:12.240
 It's like why is it correlated with Elon tweeting about it?

1:19:12.240 --> 1:19:15.040
 It's not just Elon alone tweeting, right?

1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:17.960
 It's like Elon tweeting and that becomes

1:19:17.960 --> 1:19:22.080
 a catalyst for everybody on the internet kind of like spreading

1:19:22.080 --> 1:19:22.960
 the joke, right?

1:19:22.960 --> 1:19:23.480
 Exactly.

1:19:23.480 --> 1:19:24.200
 The joke of it.

1:19:24.200 --> 1:19:28.560
 So it's the initial spark of the fire for Wall Street

1:19:28.560 --> 1:19:30.520
 bets type of situation.

1:19:30.520 --> 1:19:31.040
 Yeah.

1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:33.680
 And that's fascinating because jokes

1:19:33.680 --> 1:19:37.880
 seem to spread faster than other mechanisms.

1:19:37.880 --> 1:19:43.440
 Like funny shit is very effective at captivating

1:19:43.440 --> 1:19:47.160
 the discourse on the internet.

1:19:47.160 --> 1:19:51.520
 Yeah, and I think you can have, like I like the one meme,

1:19:51.520 --> 1:19:54.040
 like Doge, I haven't heard that name in a long time.

1:19:57.760 --> 1:20:00.760
 Like I think back to that meme often.

1:20:00.760 --> 1:20:01.640
 That's like funny.

1:20:01.640 --> 1:20:04.120
 And every time I think back to it,

1:20:04.120 --> 1:20:08.680
 there's a little probability that I might buy it, right?

1:20:08.680 --> 1:20:12.080
 And so imagine you have millions of people who have had

1:20:12.080 --> 1:20:14.400
 all these great jokes, told them,

1:20:14.400 --> 1:20:16.320
 and every now and then they reminisce,

1:20:16.320 --> 1:20:17.840
 oh, that was really funny.

1:20:17.840 --> 1:20:21.960
 And then they're like, let me buy some.

1:20:21.960 --> 1:20:25.440
 Wouldn't that be interesting if we travel in time

1:20:25.440 --> 1:20:28.720
 like multiple centuries where the entirety

1:20:28.720 --> 1:20:33.400
 of the communication of the human species is like humor?

1:20:33.400 --> 1:20:35.480
 Like it's all just jokes.

1:20:35.480 --> 1:20:39.840
 Like we're high on probably some really advanced drugs

1:20:39.840 --> 1:20:42.480
 and we're all just laughing nonstop.

1:20:42.480 --> 1:20:47.320
 It's a weird like dystopian future of just humor.

1:20:47.320 --> 1:20:52.320
 Elon has made me realize how like good it feels

1:20:53.200 --> 1:20:55.400
 to just not take shit seriously every once in a while

1:20:55.400 --> 1:20:58.600
 and just relieve like the pressure of the world.

1:20:58.600 --> 1:21:03.240
 At the same time, the reason I don't always like

1:21:03.240 --> 1:21:06.360
 when people finish their sentences with lol

1:21:06.360 --> 1:21:11.360
 is like when you don't take anything seriously.

1:21:11.360 --> 1:21:13.840
 When everything becomes a joke,

1:21:13.840 --> 1:21:18.840
 then it feels like that way of thinking

1:21:20.200 --> 1:21:22.280
 feels like it will destroy the world.

1:21:22.280 --> 1:21:24.000
 It's like, I often think of like,

1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:25.880
 will memes save the world or destroy it?

1:21:25.880 --> 1:21:28.560
 Because I think both are possible directions.

1:21:28.560 --> 1:21:30.320
 Yeah, I think this is a big problem.

1:21:30.320 --> 1:21:33.200
 I mean, I always felt that about America,

1:21:33.200 --> 1:21:36.320
 a lot of people are telling jokes kind of all the time

1:21:36.320 --> 1:21:37.800
 and they're kind of good at it.

1:21:37.800 --> 1:21:42.080
 And you take someone aside, an American,

1:21:42.080 --> 1:21:44.240
 you're like, I really wanna have a sincere conversation.

1:21:44.240 --> 1:21:46.760
 It's like hard to even keep a straight face

1:21:46.760 --> 1:21:50.400
 because everything is so, there's so much levity.

1:21:50.400 --> 1:21:51.320
 So it's complicated.

1:21:51.320 --> 1:21:54.920
 I like how sincere actually like your Twitter can be.

1:21:54.920 --> 1:21:57.920
 You're like, I am in love with the world today.

1:21:57.920 --> 1:22:00.640
 I get so much shit for it, it's hilarious.

1:22:00.640 --> 1:22:03.120
 I'm never gonna stop because I realize like,

1:22:03.120 --> 1:22:05.240
 you have to be able to sometimes just be real

1:22:05.240 --> 1:22:09.200
 and be positive and just be, say the cliche things,

1:22:09.200 --> 1:22:11.960
 which ultimately those things actually capture

1:22:11.960 --> 1:22:15.040
 some fundamental truths about life.

1:22:15.040 --> 1:22:16.560
 But it's a dance.

1:22:16.560 --> 1:22:19.640
 And I think Elon does a good job of that

1:22:20.560 --> 1:22:22.960
 from an engineering perspective of being able to joke,

1:22:22.960 --> 1:22:26.800
 but everyone's mostly to pull back and be like,

1:22:26.800 --> 1:22:29.720
 here's real problems, let's solve them and so on.

1:22:29.720 --> 1:22:31.800
 And then be able to jump back to a joke.

1:22:31.800 --> 1:22:36.280
 So it's ultimately, I think, I guess a skill that we

1:22:36.280 --> 1:22:37.120
 have to learn.

1:22:39.040 --> 1:22:41.760
 But I guess your advice is to invest everything

1:22:41.760 --> 1:22:44.640
 anyone listening owns into Dogecoin.

1:22:44.640 --> 1:22:46.120
 That's what I heard from this interaction.

1:22:46.120 --> 1:22:46.960
 Yeah, no, exactly.

1:22:46.960 --> 1:22:50.360
 Yeah, our hedge fund is unavailable.

1:22:50.360 --> 1:22:52.320
 Just go straight to Dogecoin.

1:22:52.320 --> 1:22:55.120
 You're running a successful company.

1:22:55.120 --> 1:22:58.600
 It's just interesting because my mind has been in that space

1:22:58.600 --> 1:23:01.920
 of potentially just being one of the millions of other

1:23:01.920 --> 1:23:03.360
 entrepreneurs.

1:23:03.360 --> 1:23:08.360
 What's your advice on how to build a successful startup,

1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:10.480
 how to build a successful company?

1:23:10.480 --> 1:23:13.760
 I think that one thing I do like,

1:23:13.760 --> 1:23:16.880
 and it might be a particular thing about America,

1:23:16.880 --> 1:23:20.600
 but there is something about playing,

1:23:20.600 --> 1:23:23.960
 tell people what you really want to happen in the world.

1:23:23.960 --> 1:23:25.400
 Don't stop.

1:23:25.400 --> 1:23:28.720
 It's not gonna make it,

1:23:28.720 --> 1:23:31.080
 like if you're asking someone to invest in your company,

1:23:31.080 --> 1:23:33.720
 don't say, I think maybe one day we might make

1:23:33.720 --> 1:23:34.680
 a million dollars.

1:23:35.920 --> 1:23:38.520
 When you actually believe something else,

1:23:38.520 --> 1:23:41.480
 you actually believe you're actually more optimistic,

1:23:41.480 --> 1:23:45.240
 but you're toning down your optimism because you want

1:23:45.240 --> 1:23:50.080
 to appear like low risk.

1:23:50.080 --> 1:23:53.320
 But actually it's super high risk if your company

1:23:53.320 --> 1:23:56.720
 becomes mediocre because no one wants to work

1:23:56.720 --> 1:23:57.560
 in a mediocre company.

1:23:57.560 --> 1:24:00.000
 No one wants to invest in a mediocre company.

1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:02.640
 So you should play the real game.

1:24:02.640 --> 1:24:04.480
 And obviously this doesn't apply to all businesses,

1:24:04.480 --> 1:24:07.720
 but if you play a venture backed startup kind of game,

1:24:07.720 --> 1:24:10.520
 like play for keeps, play to win, go big.

1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:13.240
 And it's very hard to do that.

1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:18.200
 I've always feel like, yeah,

1:24:18.200 --> 1:24:22.040
 you can start narrowing your focus because 10 people

1:24:22.040 --> 1:24:26.200
 are telling you, you gotta care about this boring thing

1:24:26.200 --> 1:24:28.000
 that won't matter five years from now.

1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:31.600
 And you should push back and do the real,

1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:32.440
 play the real game.

1:24:32.440 --> 1:24:33.840
 So be bold.

1:24:33.840 --> 1:24:37.840
 So both, I mean, there's an interesting duality there.

1:24:37.840 --> 1:24:41.080
 So there's the way you speak to other people

1:24:41.080 --> 1:24:45.360
 about like your plans and what you are like privately

1:24:45.360 --> 1:24:48.120
 just in your own mind.

1:24:48.120 --> 1:24:50.160
 And maybe it's connected with what you were saying about,

1:24:50.160 --> 1:24:51.920
 yeah, sincerity as well.

1:24:51.920 --> 1:24:55.800
 Like if you appear to be sincerely optimistic

1:24:55.800 --> 1:24:59.680
 about something that's big or crazy,

1:24:59.680 --> 1:25:01.640
 it's putting yourself up to be kind of like

1:25:01.640 --> 1:25:03.160
 ridiculed or something.

1:25:03.160 --> 1:25:08.000
 And so if you say, my mission is to, yeah, go to Mars,

1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:12.640
 it's just so bonkers that it's hard to say.

1:25:12.640 --> 1:25:16.520
 It is, but one powerful thing, just like you said,

1:25:17.680 --> 1:25:20.240
 is if you say it and you believe it,

1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:25.240
 then actually amazing people come and work with you.

1:25:25.680 --> 1:25:26.520
 Exactly.

1:25:26.520 --> 1:25:28.800
 It's not just skill, but the dreams.

1:25:28.800 --> 1:25:31.640
 There's something about optimism that,

1:25:31.640 --> 1:25:33.960
 like that fire that you have when you're optimistic

1:25:33.960 --> 1:25:36.200
 of actually having the hope of building

1:25:36.200 --> 1:25:38.960
 something totally cool, something totally new,

1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:41.120
 that when those people get in a room together,

1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:42.840
 like they can actually do it.

1:25:42.840 --> 1:25:43.840
 Yeah.

1:25:43.840 --> 1:25:47.480
 Yeah, there's, yeah, that's,

1:25:47.480 --> 1:25:50.800
 and also makes life really fun when you're in that room.

1:25:50.800 --> 1:25:55.080
 So all of that together, ultimately,

1:25:55.080 --> 1:25:57.160
 I don't know, that's what makes this crazy ride

1:25:57.160 --> 1:25:59.640
 of a startup really look fun.

1:25:59.640 --> 1:26:02.520
 And Elon is an example of a person who succeeded at that.

1:26:02.520 --> 1:26:06.040
 There's not many other inspiring figures, which is sad.

1:26:06.040 --> 1:26:11.040
 I used to be at Google and there's something that happens

1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:13.200
 that sometimes when the company grows

1:26:13.200 --> 1:26:14.440
 bigger and bigger and bigger,

1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:18.760
 where that kind of ambition kind of quiets down a little bit.

1:26:18.760 --> 1:26:19.600
 Yeah.

1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:21.840
 Google had this ambition, still does,

1:26:21.840 --> 1:26:24.880
 of making the world's information accessible to everyone.

1:26:24.880 --> 1:26:28.320
 And I remember, I don't know, that's beautiful.

1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:33.160
 I still love that dream of that they used to scan books,

1:26:33.160 --> 1:26:34.760
 but just in every way possible

1:26:34.760 --> 1:26:37.480
 make the world's information accessible.

1:26:37.480 --> 1:26:38.640
 Same with Wikipedia.

1:26:38.640 --> 1:26:40.480
 Every time I open up Wikipedia,

1:26:40.480 --> 1:26:45.480
 I'm just awe inspired by how awesome humans are, man.

1:26:47.200 --> 1:26:48.600
 And creating this together,

1:26:48.600 --> 1:26:50.280
 I don't know what the meanings are over there,

1:26:50.280 --> 1:26:52.720
 but it's just beautiful.

1:26:52.720 --> 1:26:55.200
 Like what they've created is incredible.

1:26:55.200 --> 1:26:58.880
 And I'd love to be able to be part of something like that.

1:26:58.880 --> 1:27:01.800
 And you're right, for that, you have to be bold.

1:27:01.800 --> 1:27:03.480
 And there's, and strange to me also,

1:27:03.480 --> 1:27:04.600
 I think you're right that there's

1:27:04.600 --> 1:27:06.760
 how many boring companies there are.

1:27:06.760 --> 1:27:08.880
 Something I always talk about, especially in FinTech,

1:27:08.880 --> 1:27:13.400
 it's like, why am I excited about, this is so lame.

1:27:13.400 --> 1:27:16.360
 Like what is, this isn't even important.

1:27:16.360 --> 1:27:19.320
 Even if you succeed, this is gonna be like terrible.

1:27:19.320 --> 1:27:21.040
 This is not good.

1:27:21.040 --> 1:27:23.320
 And it's just strange how people can kind of

1:27:23.320 --> 1:27:27.720
 get fake enthusiastic about like boring ideas

1:27:27.720 --> 1:27:31.680
 when there's so many bigger ideas that,

1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:33.680
 yeah, I mean, you read these things,

1:27:33.680 --> 1:27:35.000
 like this company raises money,

1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:36.400
 and it's just like, that's a lot of money

1:27:36.400 --> 1:27:38.520
 for the worst idea I've ever heard.

1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:41.440
 Some ideas are really big.

1:27:41.440 --> 1:27:44.520
 So like I worked on autonomous vehicles quite a bit.

1:27:44.520 --> 1:27:48.080
 And there's so many ways in which you can present

1:27:48.080 --> 1:27:50.680
 that idea to yourself, to the team you work with,

1:27:50.680 --> 1:27:53.120
 to just, yeah, like to yourself when you're quietly

1:27:53.120 --> 1:27:55.200
 looking in the mirror in the morning,

1:27:55.200 --> 1:27:58.320
 that's really boring or really exciting.

1:27:58.320 --> 1:28:01.880
 Like if you're really ambitious with autonomous vehicles,

1:28:01.880 --> 1:28:06.320
 it changes the nature of like human robot interaction,

1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:08.160
 it changes the nature of how we move.

1:28:08.160 --> 1:28:09.920
 Forget money, forget all that stuff.

1:28:09.920 --> 1:28:13.240
 It changes like everything about robotics and AI,

1:28:13.240 --> 1:28:16.440
 machine learning, it changes everything about manufacture.

1:28:16.440 --> 1:28:20.080
 I mean, cars, transportation is so fundamentally connected

1:28:20.080 --> 1:28:22.320
 to cars, and if that changes,

1:28:22.320 --> 1:28:24.560
 it's changing the fabric of society,

1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:26.360
 of movies, of everything.

1:28:27.360 --> 1:28:29.560
 And if you go bold and take risks

1:28:29.560 --> 1:28:33.800
 and be willing to go bankrupt with your company,

1:28:33.800 --> 1:28:37.520
 as opposed to cautiously, you can really change the world.

1:28:37.520 --> 1:28:40.560
 And it's so sad for me to see all these autonomous companies,

1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:41.520
 autonomous vehicle companies,

1:28:41.520 --> 1:28:45.160
 they're like really more focused about fundraising

1:28:45.160 --> 1:28:46.400
 and kind of like smoke and mirrors,

1:28:46.400 --> 1:28:48.240
 they're really afraid,

1:28:48.240 --> 1:28:51.760
 the entirety of their marketing is grounded in fear

1:28:51.760 --> 1:28:54.960
 and presenting enough smoke to where they keep raising funds

1:28:54.960 --> 1:28:59.080
 so they can cautiously use technology of a previous decade

1:28:59.080 --> 1:29:02.400
 or previous two decades to kind of test vehicles

1:29:02.400 --> 1:29:04.960
 here and there, as opposed to do crazy things

1:29:04.960 --> 1:29:09.960
 and bold and go huge at scale, do huge data collection.

1:29:10.080 --> 1:29:12.760
 And yeah, so that's just an example.

1:29:12.760 --> 1:29:14.400
 Like the idea can be big,

1:29:14.400 --> 1:29:17.080
 but if you don't allow yourself to take that idea

1:29:17.080 --> 1:29:20.160
 and think really big with it,

1:29:20.160 --> 1:29:22.320
 then you're not gonna make anything happen.

1:29:22.320 --> 1:29:24.200
 Yeah, you're absolutely right in that.

1:29:24.200 --> 1:29:28.880
 So you've been connected in your work

1:29:28.880 --> 1:29:31.280
 with a bunch of amazing people.

1:29:31.280 --> 1:29:34.440
 How much interaction do you have with investors,

1:29:34.440 --> 1:29:36.840
 that whole process is an entire mystery to me.

1:29:36.840 --> 1:29:38.600
 Is there some people that just have influence

1:29:38.600 --> 1:29:42.960
 on the trajectory of your thinking completely,

1:29:42.960 --> 1:29:46.920
 or is it just this collective energy behind the company?

1:29:46.920 --> 1:29:51.920
 Yeah, I mean, I came here and I was amazed how,

1:29:52.160 --> 1:29:54.840
 yeah, people would, I was only here for a few months

1:29:54.840 --> 1:29:57.160
 and I met some incredible investors

1:29:57.160 --> 1:29:59.720
 and I'd almost run out of money.

1:29:59.720 --> 1:30:04.720
 And once they invested, I was like,

1:30:04.880 --> 1:30:06.800
 I am not gonna let you down.

1:30:06.800 --> 1:30:08.280
 And I was like, okay, I'm gonna send them

1:30:08.280 --> 1:30:11.600
 like an email update every like three minutes.

1:30:11.600 --> 1:30:14.160
 And then they don't care at all.

1:30:14.160 --> 1:30:15.720
 So they kind of wanna, I don't know, like,

1:30:15.720 --> 1:30:18.200
 so for some, I like it when it's just like,

1:30:18.200 --> 1:30:20.040
 they're always available to talk,

1:30:20.040 --> 1:30:23.360
 but a lot of building a business,

1:30:23.360 --> 1:30:25.400
 especially a high tech business,

1:30:26.560 --> 1:30:29.240
 there's a little for them to add, right?

1:30:29.240 --> 1:30:31.240
 There's little for them to add on product.

1:30:31.240 --> 1:30:34.320
 There's a lot for them to add on like business development.

1:30:34.320 --> 1:30:36.400
 And if we are doing product research,

1:30:36.400 --> 1:30:39.000
 which is for us research into the market,

1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:41.800
 research into how to make a great hedge fund,

1:30:41.800 --> 1:30:43.360
 and we do that for years,

1:30:44.920 --> 1:30:47.120
 there's not much to tell the investors.

1:30:47.120 --> 1:30:49.040
 So that basically is like, I believe in you.

1:30:49.040 --> 1:30:52.440
 There's something, I like the cut of your jib.

1:30:52.440 --> 1:30:55.760
 There's something in your idea, in your ambition,

1:30:55.760 --> 1:30:57.880
 in your plans that I like.

1:30:57.880 --> 1:30:59.800
 And it's almost like a pat on the back.

1:30:59.800 --> 1:31:01.560
 It's like, go get them kid.

1:31:01.560 --> 1:31:02.720
 Yeah, it is a bit like that.

1:31:02.720 --> 1:31:04.360
 And that's cool.

1:31:04.360 --> 1:31:05.280
 That's a good way to do it.

1:31:05.280 --> 1:31:07.120
 I'm glad they do it that way.

1:31:07.120 --> 1:31:08.800
 Like the one meeting I had,

1:31:08.800 --> 1:31:10.240
 which was like really good with this

1:31:10.240 --> 1:31:12.400
 was meeting Howard Morgan,

1:31:13.280 --> 1:31:16.760
 who's actually a co founder of Renaissance Technologies

1:31:16.760 --> 1:31:21.000
 in the like 1980s and worked with Jim Simons.

1:31:21.000 --> 1:31:25.840
 And he was in the room

1:31:25.840 --> 1:31:28.200
 and I was meeting some other guy and he was in the room

1:31:28.200 --> 1:31:33.000
 and I was explaining how quantitative finance works.

1:31:33.000 --> 1:31:36.600
 I was like, so they use mathematical models.

1:31:36.600 --> 1:31:40.480
 And then he was like, yeah, I started Renaissance.

1:31:40.480 --> 1:31:41.920
 I know a bit about this.

1:31:43.160 --> 1:31:45.080
 And then I was like, oh my God.

1:31:46.680 --> 1:31:50.320
 So yeah, but then, and then I think he kind of said, well,

1:31:50.320 --> 1:31:52.160
 yeah, he said, well, cause I was talking,

1:31:52.160 --> 1:31:55.920
 he was working at first round capital as a partner

1:31:55.920 --> 1:31:58.320
 and they kind of said, they didn't want to invest.

1:31:59.200 --> 1:32:01.920
 And then I wrote a blog post describing the idea

1:32:01.920 --> 1:32:03.640
 and I was like, I really think you guys should invest.

1:32:03.640 --> 1:32:04.560
 And then they end up.

1:32:04.560 --> 1:32:05.760
 Oh, interesting.

1:32:05.760 --> 1:32:06.600
 You convinced them on that.

1:32:06.600 --> 1:32:07.440
 That must be good.

1:32:07.440 --> 1:32:08.280
 Yeah, cause they're like,

1:32:08.280 --> 1:32:09.120
 we don't really invest in hedge funds.

1:32:09.120 --> 1:32:11.240
 And I was like, you don't see like what I'm doing.

1:32:11.240 --> 1:32:14.400
 This is so a tech company, not a hedge fund, right?

1:32:14.400 --> 1:32:15.800
 Yeah, and Numerai is brilliant.

1:32:15.800 --> 1:32:18.240
 It's, when it caught my eye,

1:32:18.240 --> 1:32:19.240
 there's something special there.

1:32:19.240 --> 1:32:22.720
 So I really do hope you succeed in the,

1:32:22.720 --> 1:32:24.880
 obviously it's a risky thing you're taking on,

1:32:24.880 --> 1:32:26.560
 the ambition of it, the size of it,

1:32:26.560 --> 1:32:28.320
 but I do hope you succeed.

1:32:28.320 --> 1:32:30.400
 You mentioned Jim Simons.

1:32:30.400 --> 1:32:34.520
 He comes up in another world of mine really often on the,

1:32:34.520 --> 1:32:37.720
 he's just a brilliant guy on the mathematics side

1:32:37.720 --> 1:32:38.760
 as a mathematician,

1:32:38.760 --> 1:32:43.760
 but he's also brilliant finance hedge fund manager guy.

1:32:44.120 --> 1:32:47.040
 Have you gotten a chance to interact with him at all?

1:32:47.040 --> 1:32:51.080
 Have you learned anything from him on the math,

1:32:51.080 --> 1:32:54.960
 on the finance, on the philosophy, life side, things?

1:32:54.960 --> 1:32:56.280
 I've played poker with him.

1:32:56.280 --> 1:32:57.120
 It was pretty cool.

1:32:57.120 --> 1:32:59.680
 It was like, actually in the show, Billions,

1:32:59.680 --> 1:33:02.680
 they kind of do a little thing about this poker tournament

1:33:02.680 --> 1:33:04.240
 thing with all the hedge fund managers.

1:33:04.240 --> 1:33:05.680
 And that's real life thing.

1:33:06.840 --> 1:33:09.760
 And they have a lot of like world series of bracelet,

1:33:09.760 --> 1:33:11.800
 world series poker bracelets holders,

1:33:11.800 --> 1:33:13.520
 but it's kind of Jim's thing.

1:33:13.520 --> 1:33:18.520
 And I met him there and yeah, it was kind of brief,

1:33:19.200 --> 1:33:21.480
 but I was just like, he's like, oh, how do you,

1:33:21.480 --> 1:33:22.320
 why are you here?

1:33:22.320 --> 1:33:23.880
 And I was like, oh, Howard sent me, you know,

1:33:23.880 --> 1:33:25.960
 he's like, go play this tournament,

1:33:25.960 --> 1:33:27.800
 meet some of the other players.

1:33:27.800 --> 1:33:29.000
 And then...

1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:30.120
 Was it Texas Holdem?

1:33:30.120 --> 1:33:32.240
 Yeah, Texas Holdem tournament, yeah.

1:33:32.240 --> 1:33:33.800
 Do you play poker yourself or was it?

1:33:33.800 --> 1:33:34.880
 Yeah, I do.

1:33:34.880 --> 1:33:36.440
 I mean, it was crazy.

1:33:36.440 --> 1:33:39.080
 On my right was the CEO,

1:33:39.080 --> 1:33:42.200
 who's the current CEO of Renaissance, Peter Brown.

1:33:42.200 --> 1:33:47.200
 And Peter Muller, who's a hedge fund manager at PDT.

1:33:49.160 --> 1:33:50.440
 And yeah, I mean, it was just like,

1:33:50.440 --> 1:33:51.760
 and then, you know, just everyone.

1:33:51.760 --> 1:33:53.200
 And then all these bracelet world series,

1:33:53.200 --> 1:33:55.560
 like people that I know from like TV.

1:33:56.960 --> 1:34:00.400
 And Robert Mercer, who's fucking crazy.

1:34:01.440 --> 1:34:02.280
 Who's that?

1:34:02.280 --> 1:34:05.640
 He's the guy who donated the most money to Trump.

1:34:08.280 --> 1:34:09.120
 And he's just like...

1:34:09.120 --> 1:34:10.240
 It's a lot of personality.

1:34:10.240 --> 1:34:12.600
 Character, yeah, geez, it's crazy.

1:34:13.920 --> 1:34:17.600
 So it's quite cool how, yeah, like the, it was really fun.

1:34:17.600 --> 1:34:19.600
 And then I managed to knock out Peter Muller.

1:34:19.600 --> 1:34:22.680
 I have a, I got a little trophy for knocking him out

1:34:22.680 --> 1:34:24.440
 because he was a previous champion.

1:34:24.440 --> 1:34:25.880
 In fact, I think he's won the most.

1:34:25.880 --> 1:34:27.560
 I think he's won three times.

1:34:27.560 --> 1:34:28.600
 Super smart guy.

1:34:30.520 --> 1:34:35.520
 But I will say Jim outlasted me in the tournament.

1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:40.520
 And they're all extremely good at poker,

1:34:41.680 --> 1:34:44.600
 but they're also, so it was a $10,000 buy in.

1:34:45.880 --> 1:34:48.960
 And I was like, this is kind of expensive,

1:34:50.400 --> 1:34:53.560
 but it all goes to charity, Jim's math charity.

1:34:54.440 --> 1:34:58.360
 But then the way they play, they have like rebis

1:34:58.360 --> 1:35:01.080
 and like they all do a shit ton of rebis

1:35:01.080 --> 1:35:02.720
 because it's for charity.

1:35:02.720 --> 1:35:06.240
 So immediately they're like going all in

1:35:06.240 --> 1:35:11.240
 and I'm like, man, like, so I ended up adding more as well.

1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:15.360
 So it's like you couldn't play at all without doing that.

1:35:15.360 --> 1:35:16.640
 Yeah, the stakes are high.

1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:18.760
 But you're connected to a lot of these folks

1:35:18.760 --> 1:35:23.760
 that are kind of titans of just of economics

1:35:25.760 --> 1:35:27.200
 and tech in general.

1:35:27.200 --> 1:35:28.720
 Do you feel a burden from this?

1:35:28.720 --> 1:35:30.200
 You're a young guy.

1:35:30.200 --> 1:35:33.760
 I did feel a bit out of place there.

1:35:33.760 --> 1:35:35.640
 The company was quite new

1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:39.920
 and they also don't speak about things, right?

1:35:39.920 --> 1:35:44.320
 So it's not like going to meet a famous rocket engineer

1:35:44.320 --> 1:35:46.200
 who will tell you how to make a rocket.

1:35:46.200 --> 1:35:48.040
 They do not want to tell you anything

1:35:48.040 --> 1:35:49.600
 about how to make a hedge fund.

1:35:49.600 --> 1:35:53.000
 It's like all secretive and that part I didn't like.

1:35:54.200 --> 1:35:57.720
 And they were also kind of making fun of me a little bit.

1:35:57.720 --> 1:36:00.600
 Like they would say, like they'd call me like,

1:36:00.600 --> 1:36:02.000
 I don't know, the Bitcoin kid or.

1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:02.840
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:36:02.840 --> 1:36:05.280
 And then they would say, even things like,

1:36:05.280 --> 1:36:08.880
 member Peter, yeah, said to me something like,

1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:12.960
 I don't think AI is gonna have a big role in finance.

1:36:12.960 --> 1:36:16.040
 And I was like, hearing this from the CEO of Renaissance

1:36:16.040 --> 1:36:17.960
 was like weird to hear because I was like,

1:36:17.960 --> 1:36:19.080
 of course it will.

1:36:19.080 --> 1:36:21.200
 And he's like, but he can see,

1:36:21.200 --> 1:36:23.400
 I can see it having a really big impact

1:36:23.400 --> 1:36:25.600
 on things like self driving cars.

1:36:25.600 --> 1:36:28.280
 But finance, it's too noisy and whatever.

1:36:28.280 --> 1:36:30.640
 And so I don't think it's like the perfect application.

1:36:30.640 --> 1:36:32.520
 And I was like, that was interesting to hear

1:36:32.520 --> 1:36:35.560
 because it's like, and I think it was that same day

1:36:35.560 --> 1:36:40.560
 that Libra, I think it is, the poker playing AI

1:36:40.840 --> 1:36:42.840
 started to beat like the human.

1:36:42.840 --> 1:36:44.480
 So it was kind of funny hearing them like say,

1:36:44.480 --> 1:36:47.280
 oh, I'm not sure AI could ever attack that problem.

1:36:47.280 --> 1:36:49.360
 And then that very day it's attacking the problem

1:36:49.360 --> 1:36:51.080
 of the game we're playing.

1:36:51.080 --> 1:36:55.720
 Well, there's a kind of a magic to somebody

1:36:55.720 --> 1:36:59.920
 who's exceptionally successful looking at you,

1:36:59.920 --> 1:37:03.560
 giving you respect, but also saying that what you're doing

1:37:03.560 --> 1:37:06.280
 is not going to succeed in a sense.

1:37:06.280 --> 1:37:08.200
 Like they're not really saying it,

1:37:08.200 --> 1:37:11.240
 but I tend to believe from my interactions with people

1:37:11.240 --> 1:37:14.880
 that it's a kind of prod to say like, prove me wrong.

1:37:14.880 --> 1:37:15.720
 Yeah.

1:37:15.720 --> 1:37:18.040
 That's ultimately, that's how those guys talk.

1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:20.440
 They see good talent and they're like.

1:37:20.440 --> 1:37:21.280
 Yeah.

1:37:21.280 --> 1:37:22.400
 And I think they're also saying

1:37:22.400 --> 1:37:25.880
 it's not gonna succeed quickly in some way.

1:37:25.880 --> 1:37:29.080
 They're like, this is gonna take a long time

1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:32.760
 and maybe that's good to know.

1:37:32.760 --> 1:37:36.320
 And certainly AI in trading,

1:37:36.320 --> 1:37:41.320
 that's one of the most philosophically interesting questions

1:37:42.280 --> 1:37:45.920
 about artificial intelligence and the nature of money.

1:37:45.920 --> 1:37:48.920
 Because it's like, how much can you extract

1:37:48.920 --> 1:37:52.360
 in terms of patterns from all of these millions

1:37:52.360 --> 1:37:57.240
 of humans interacting using this methodology of money?

1:37:57.240 --> 1:37:58.680
 It's like one of the open questions

1:37:58.680 --> 1:37:59.680
 in the artificial intelligence.

1:37:59.680 --> 1:38:02.360
 In that sense, you converting into a data set

1:38:02.360 --> 1:38:07.120
 is one of like the biggest gifts to the research community,

1:38:07.120 --> 1:38:11.080
 to the whole, anyone who loves data science and AI,

1:38:11.080 --> 1:38:14.080
 this is kind of fascinating.

1:38:14.080 --> 1:38:15.680
 I'd love to see where this goes actually.

1:38:15.680 --> 1:38:19.840
 I think I say sometimes long before AGI destroys the world,

1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:21.800
 a narrow intelligence will win all the money

1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:23.240
 in the stock market.

1:38:23.240 --> 1:38:25.440
 Way, like just a narrow AI.

1:38:25.440 --> 1:38:26.360
 Yeah.

1:38:26.360 --> 1:38:29.920
 And I don't know if I'm gonna be the one who invents that.

1:38:29.920 --> 1:38:31.960
 So I'm building Numerai to make sure

1:38:31.960 --> 1:38:34.480
 that that narrow AI uses our data.

1:38:35.840 --> 1:38:37.000
 So you're giving a platform

1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:38.800
 to where millions of people can participate

1:38:38.800 --> 1:38:43.280
 and do build that narrow AI themselves.

1:38:43.280 --> 1:38:45.600
 People love it when I ask this kind of question

1:38:45.600 --> 1:38:50.560
 about books, about ideas and philosophers and so on.

1:38:50.560 --> 1:38:55.560
 I was wondering if you had books or ideas,

1:38:56.760 --> 1:38:59.120
 philosophers, thinkers that had an influence

1:38:59.120 --> 1:39:01.440
 on your life when you were growing up

1:39:01.440 --> 1:39:04.520
 or just today that you would recommend

1:39:04.520 --> 1:39:08.880
 that people check out blog posts, podcasts, videos,

1:39:08.880 --> 1:39:09.720
 all that kind of stuff.

1:39:09.720 --> 1:39:12.080
 Is there something that just kind of had an impact on you

1:39:12.080 --> 1:39:13.760
 that you couldn't recommend?

1:39:13.760 --> 1:39:18.760
 A super kind of obvious one that I really,

1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:22.240
 I was reading Zero to One while coming up with Numerai.

1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:24.880
 It was like halfway through the book.

1:39:24.880 --> 1:39:27.160
 And I really do like a lot of the ideas there.

1:39:27.160 --> 1:39:29.360
 And it's also about kind of thinking big

1:39:29.360 --> 1:39:34.360
 and also it's like peculiar little book.

1:39:34.760 --> 1:39:36.400
 It's like why, like there's a little picture

1:39:36.400 --> 1:39:38.800
 of the hipster versus Unabomber.

1:39:38.800 --> 1:39:40.480
 And it's a weird little book.

1:39:40.480 --> 1:39:42.760
 So I like, there's kind of like some depth there.

1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:44.920
 In terms of a book on a, if you're thinking

1:39:44.920 --> 1:39:47.320
 of doing a startup, that's a good book.

1:39:47.320 --> 1:39:52.320
 A book I like a lot is maybe my favorite book

1:39:52.320 --> 1:39:54.960
 is David Deutsch's Beginning of Infinity.

1:39:56.200 --> 1:40:00.360
 I just found that so optimistic.

1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:03.800
 It puts you, everything you read in science,

1:40:03.800 --> 1:40:06.520
 it like makes the world feel like kind of colder

1:40:06.520 --> 1:40:10.640
 because like it's like we're just coming from evolution

1:40:10.640 --> 1:40:15.200
 and coming from nothing should be this way or whatever.

1:40:15.200 --> 1:40:16.800
 And humans are not very powerful.

1:40:16.800 --> 1:40:19.240
 We're just like scum on the earth.

1:40:19.240 --> 1:40:20.960
 And the way David Deutsch sees things

1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:23.840
 and argues, he argues them with the same rigor

1:40:23.840 --> 1:40:26.200
 that the cynics often use

1:40:26.200 --> 1:40:29.840
 and then has a much better conclusion.

1:40:29.840 --> 1:40:33.480
 That's some of the statements of things like,

1:40:33.480 --> 1:40:35.000
 anything that doesn't violate the laws

1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:39.280
 of physics can be solved.

1:40:39.280 --> 1:40:41.800
 So ultimately arriving at a hopeful,

1:40:41.800 --> 1:40:42.640
 like a hopeful path forward.

1:40:42.640 --> 1:40:45.680
 Yeah, without being like a hippie.

1:40:45.680 --> 1:40:47.640
 You've mentioned kind of advice for startups.

1:40:47.640 --> 1:40:50.600
 Is there, in general, whether you do a startup or not,

1:40:50.600 --> 1:40:52.680
 do you have advice for young people today?

1:40:52.680 --> 1:40:54.160
 You're like an example of somebody

1:40:54.160 --> 1:40:56.240
 who's paved their own path

1:40:56.240 --> 1:40:59.200
 and were, I would say exceptionally successful.

1:40:59.200 --> 1:41:02.800
 Is there advice, somebody who's like 20 today, 18,

1:41:02.800 --> 1:41:05.640
 undergrad or thinking about going to college,

1:41:05.640 --> 1:41:09.520
 or in college and so on that you would give them?

1:41:09.520 --> 1:41:13.560
 I think I often tell young people don't start companies.

1:41:13.560 --> 1:41:16.040
 Is it not, don't start a company

1:41:16.040 --> 1:41:19.120
 unless you're prepared to make it your life's work.

1:41:19.120 --> 1:41:22.480
 Like that's a really good way of putting it.

1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:25.760
 And a lot of people think, well, this semester

1:41:25.760 --> 1:41:27.280
 I'm gonna take a semester off.

1:41:27.280 --> 1:41:28.560
 And in that one semester,

1:41:28.560 --> 1:41:31.240
 I'm gonna start a company and sell it or whatever.

1:41:31.240 --> 1:41:33.360
 And it's just like, what are you talking about?

1:41:33.360 --> 1:41:34.960
 It doesn't really work that way.

1:41:34.960 --> 1:41:37.200
 You should be like super into the idea,

1:41:37.200 --> 1:41:40.640
 so into it that you wanna spend a really long time on it.

1:41:41.560 --> 1:41:44.040
 Is that more about psychology or actual time allocation?

1:41:44.040 --> 1:41:47.560
 Like, is it literally the fact that you need to give 100%

1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:49.840
 for potentially years for it to succeed?

1:41:49.840 --> 1:41:53.600
 Or is it more about just the mindset that's required?

1:41:53.600 --> 1:41:55.800
 Yeah, I mean, I think, well, any, I think, yeah,

1:41:55.800 --> 1:41:56.640
 you don't wanna have,

1:41:56.640 --> 1:41:59.200
 certainly don't wanna have a plan to sell the company

1:42:00.800 --> 1:42:02.160
 like quickly or something,

1:42:02.160 --> 1:42:05.560
 or it's like a company that has a very,

1:42:05.560 --> 1:42:07.360
 it's like a big fashion component.

1:42:07.360 --> 1:42:08.720
 Like it'll only work now.

1:42:08.720 --> 1:42:10.520
 It's like an app or something.

1:42:12.640 --> 1:42:14.960
 So yeah, that's a big one.

1:42:14.960 --> 1:42:18.880
 And then I also think something I've thought about recently

1:42:18.880 --> 1:42:22.360
 is I had a job as a quant at a fund

1:42:23.480 --> 1:42:25.920
 for about two and a half years.

1:42:25.920 --> 1:42:29.080
 And part of me thinks if I had spent

1:42:29.080 --> 1:42:31.080
 another two years there,

1:42:31.080 --> 1:42:34.360
 I would have learned a lot more

1:42:34.360 --> 1:42:38.480
 and had even more knowledge to be where,

1:42:38.480 --> 1:42:41.160
 to basically accelerate how long Numerai took.

1:42:41.160 --> 1:42:44.720
 So the idea that you can sit in an air conditioned room

1:42:44.720 --> 1:42:46.280
 and get free food,

1:42:46.280 --> 1:42:48.880
 or even sit at home now in your underwear

1:42:48.880 --> 1:42:53.400
 and make a huge amount of money and learn whatever you want

1:42:53.400 --> 1:42:55.080
 and get, it's just crazy.

1:42:55.080 --> 1:42:56.480
 It's such a good deal.

1:42:56.480 --> 1:42:57.920
 Yeah, oh, that's interesting.

1:42:57.920 --> 1:43:00.360
 That's the case for, I was terrified of that.

1:43:00.360 --> 1:43:04.040
 Like at Google, I thought I would become really comfortable

1:43:04.040 --> 1:43:06.160
 in that air conditioned room.

1:43:06.160 --> 1:43:09.760
 And that, I was afraid the quant situation is,

1:43:10.640 --> 1:43:13.280
 I mean, what you present is really brilliant

1:43:13.280 --> 1:43:17.640
 that it's exceptionally valuable, the lessons you learn,

1:43:17.640 --> 1:43:21.120
 because you get to get paid while you learn from others.

1:43:21.120 --> 1:43:24.160
 If you see that, if you see jobs

1:43:24.160 --> 1:43:27.800
 in the space of your passion that way,

1:43:27.800 --> 1:43:29.360
 that it's just an education.

1:43:29.360 --> 1:43:31.400
 It's like the best kind of education.

1:43:31.400 --> 1:43:34.200
 But of course you have, from my perspective,

1:43:34.200 --> 1:43:37.320
 you have to be really careful on that to get comfortable.

1:43:37.320 --> 1:43:39.760
 Again, in a relationship, then you buy a house

1:43:39.760 --> 1:43:42.720
 or whatever the hell it is, and then you get,

1:43:42.720 --> 1:43:44.200
 and then you convince yourself like,

1:43:44.200 --> 1:43:46.640
 well, I have to pay these fees for the car,

1:43:46.640 --> 1:43:48.240
 for the house, blah, blah, blah.

1:43:48.240 --> 1:43:50.360
 And then there's momentum and all of a sudden

1:43:50.360 --> 1:43:53.080
 you're on your death bed and there's grandchildren

1:43:53.080 --> 1:43:55.160
 and you're drinking whiskey

1:43:55.160 --> 1:43:56.960
 and complaining about kids these days.

1:43:56.960 --> 1:44:00.800
 So I'm afraid of that momentum, but you're right.

1:44:00.800 --> 1:44:04.120
 Like there's something special about the education

1:44:04.120 --> 1:44:06.320
 you get working at these companies.

1:44:06.320 --> 1:44:08.200
 Yeah, and I remember on my desk,

1:44:08.200 --> 1:44:11.320
 I had like a bunch of papers on quant finance,

1:44:11.320 --> 1:44:13.280
 a bunch of papers on optimization,

1:44:13.280 --> 1:44:16.680
 and then the paper on Ethereum, just on my desk as well,

1:44:16.680 --> 1:44:19.280
 and the white paper, and it's like,

1:44:19.280 --> 1:44:23.680
 it's been amazing how kind of, and you can learn about,

1:44:23.680 --> 1:44:25.680
 so that, I also thought, I think this idea

1:44:25.680 --> 1:44:28.440
 of like learning about intersections of things,

1:44:28.440 --> 1:44:30.240
 I don't think there are too many people that know

1:44:30.240 --> 1:44:33.640
 like as much about crypto and quant finance

1:44:33.640 --> 1:44:36.280
 and machine learning as I do.

1:44:36.280 --> 1:44:39.280
 And that's a really nice set of three things

1:44:39.280 --> 1:44:40.640
 to know stuff about.

1:44:40.640 --> 1:44:43.320
 And that was because I had like free time in my job.

1:44:45.160 --> 1:44:48.640
 Okay, let me ask the perfectly impractical,

1:44:48.640 --> 1:44:49.840
 but the most important question.

1:44:49.840 --> 1:44:53.760
 What's the meaning of all the things you're trying to do

1:44:53.760 --> 1:44:56.200
 so many amazing things, why?

1:44:56.200 --> 1:45:00.800
 What's the meaning of this life of yours or ours?

1:45:00.800 --> 1:45:01.840
 I don't know.

1:45:01.840 --> 1:45:03.400
 Humans.

1:45:03.400 --> 1:45:06.300
 Yeah, so I have yet had some people say,

1:45:06.300 --> 1:45:07.760
 asking what meaning of life is,

1:45:07.760 --> 1:45:10.160
 is like asking the wrong question or something.

1:45:10.160 --> 1:45:11.160
 The question is wrong.

1:45:11.160 --> 1:45:12.000
 Yeah.

1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:14.640
 No, usually people get too nervous to be able to say that

1:45:14.640 --> 1:45:16.520
 because it's like your question sucks.

1:45:17.480 --> 1:45:18.800
 I don't think there's an answer.

1:45:18.800 --> 1:45:21.120
 It's like the searching for it.

1:45:21.120 --> 1:45:22.880
 It's like sometimes asking it.

1:45:22.880 --> 1:45:25.560
 It's like sometimes sitting back and looking up at the stars

1:45:25.560 --> 1:45:29.800
 and being like, huh, I wonder if there's aliens up there.

1:45:29.800 --> 1:45:34.800
 There's a useful like a palette cleanser aspect to it

1:45:36.520 --> 1:45:39.600
 because it kind of wakes you up to like all the little busy,

1:45:39.600 --> 1:45:42.680
 hurried day to day activities, all the meetings,

1:45:42.680 --> 1:45:45.220
 all the things you'd like a part of.

1:45:45.220 --> 1:45:47.640
 We're just like ants, a part of a system,

1:45:47.640 --> 1:45:48.920
 a part of another system.

1:45:48.920 --> 1:45:52.120
 And then asking this bigger question

1:45:52.120 --> 1:45:53.920
 allows you to kind of zoom out and think about it.

1:45:53.920 --> 1:45:55.240
 But there's ultimately,

1:45:56.240 --> 1:45:58.880
 I think it's an impossible thing for a limited capacity,

1:45:58.880 --> 1:46:01.520
 like cognitive capacity to capture.

1:46:01.520 --> 1:46:03.040
 But it's fun to listen to somebody

1:46:03.040 --> 1:46:07.240
 who's exceptionally successful, exceptionally busy now,

1:46:07.240 --> 1:46:09.800
 who's also young like you,

1:46:09.800 --> 1:46:14.640
 to ask these kinds of questions about like death.

1:46:14.640 --> 1:46:18.280
 You know, do you consider your own mortality kind of thing

1:46:18.280 --> 1:46:21.760
 and life, whether that enters your mind?

1:46:21.760 --> 1:46:23.240
 Because it often doesn't,

1:46:23.240 --> 1:46:24.920
 it kind of almost gets in the way.

1:46:24.920 --> 1:46:26.260
 Yeah.

1:46:26.260 --> 1:46:28.840
 It's amazing how many things you can like that are trivial

1:46:28.840 --> 1:46:31.280
 that could occupy a lot of your mind

1:46:31.280 --> 1:46:36.280
 until something bad happens or something flips you.

1:46:36.400 --> 1:46:38.480
 And then you start thinking about the people you love

1:46:38.480 --> 1:46:39.760
 that are in your life.

1:46:39.760 --> 1:46:41.080
 Then you started thinking about like,

1:46:41.080 --> 1:46:42.840
 holy shit, this ride ends.

1:46:42.840 --> 1:46:43.960
 Exactly.

1:46:43.960 --> 1:46:48.960
 Yeah, I just had COVID and I had it quite bad.

1:46:48.960 --> 1:46:51.720
 What wasn't really bad is just like,

1:46:51.720 --> 1:46:55.720
 I also got a simultaneous like lung infection.

1:46:55.720 --> 1:46:59.280
 So I had like almost like bronchitis or whatever.

1:46:59.280 --> 1:47:01.960
 I don't even, I don't understand that stuff,

1:47:01.960 --> 1:47:06.280
 but I started, and then you're forced to be isolated.

1:47:06.280 --> 1:47:07.120
 Right.

1:47:07.120 --> 1:47:08.880
 And so it's actually kind of nice

1:47:08.880 --> 1:47:12.440
 because it's very depressing.

1:47:12.440 --> 1:47:15.800
 And then I've heard stories of, I think it's Sean Parker.

1:47:15.800 --> 1:47:18.240
 He had like all these diseases as a child

1:47:18.240 --> 1:47:20.640
 and he had to like just stay in bed for years.

1:47:20.640 --> 1:47:22.280
 And then he like made Napster.

1:47:23.320 --> 1:47:24.840
 It's like pretty cool.

1:47:24.840 --> 1:47:27.680
 So yeah, I had about 15 days of this recently,

1:47:27.680 --> 1:47:28.520
 just last month.

1:47:28.520 --> 1:47:30.400
 And it feels like it did shock me

1:47:30.400 --> 1:47:34.640
 into a new kind of energy and ambition.

1:47:34.640 --> 1:47:37.960
 Were there moments when you were just like terrified

1:47:37.960 --> 1:47:39.680
 at the combination of loneliness?

1:47:39.680 --> 1:47:43.120
 And like, you know, the thing about COVID is like,

1:47:43.120 --> 1:47:45.480
 there's some degree of uncertainty.

1:47:45.480 --> 1:47:48.400
 Like it feels like it's a new thing, a new monster

1:47:48.400 --> 1:47:50.920
 that's arrived on this earth.

1:47:50.920 --> 1:47:54.280
 And so, you know, dealing with it alone,

1:47:54.280 --> 1:47:55.680
 a lot of people are dying.

1:47:55.680 --> 1:47:57.240
 It's like wondering like.

1:47:57.240 --> 1:47:59.200
 Yeah, you do wonder, I mean, for sure.

1:47:59.200 --> 1:48:03.160
 And then there are the even new strains in South Africa,

1:48:03.160 --> 1:48:04.000
 which is where I was.

1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:06.920
 And maybe the new strain had some interaction

1:48:06.920 --> 1:48:09.520
 with my genes and I'm just gonna die.

1:48:09.520 --> 1:48:11.440
 But ultimately it was liberating somehow.

1:48:11.440 --> 1:48:12.600
 I loved it.

1:48:12.600 --> 1:48:15.440
 Oh, I loved that I got out of it.

1:48:15.440 --> 1:48:16.280
 Okay.

1:48:16.280 --> 1:48:17.120
 Because it also affects your mind.

1:48:17.120 --> 1:48:18.680
 You get confused, you get confusion

1:48:18.680 --> 1:48:21.360
 and kind of a lot of fatigue

1:48:21.360 --> 1:48:23.360
 and you can't do your usual tricks

1:48:23.360 --> 1:48:24.800
 of psyching yourself out of it.

1:48:24.800 --> 1:48:27.440
 So, you know, sometimes it's like, oh man, I feel tired.

1:48:27.440 --> 1:48:29.720
 Okay, I'm just gonna go have coffee and then I'll be fine.

1:48:29.720 --> 1:48:31.440
 It's like, now it's like, I feel tired.

1:48:31.440 --> 1:48:33.440
 I don't even wanna get out of bed to get coffee

1:48:33.440 --> 1:48:34.680
 because I feel so tired.

1:48:34.680 --> 1:48:37.120
 And then you have to confront,

1:48:37.120 --> 1:48:40.840
 there's no like quick fix cure and you're trapped at home.

1:48:40.840 --> 1:48:43.320
 But that, so now you have this little thing

1:48:43.320 --> 1:48:44.920
 that happened to you that was a reminder

1:48:44.920 --> 1:48:48.160
 that you're mortal and you get to carry that flag

1:48:48.160 --> 1:48:53.160
 in trying to create something special in this world.

1:48:53.280 --> 1:48:54.120
 Right?

1:48:54.120 --> 1:48:54.960
 With Numerai.

1:48:54.960 --> 1:48:58.320
 Listen, this was like one of my favorite conversation

1:48:58.320 --> 1:49:03.280
 because the way you think about this world of money

1:49:03.280 --> 1:49:05.200
 and just this world in general is so clear

1:49:05.200 --> 1:49:08.680
 and you're able to explain it so eloquently.

1:49:08.680 --> 1:49:09.960
 Richard, that was really fun.

1:49:09.960 --> 1:49:11.000

 Games are won by players who focus on the playing field,

1:49:40.600 --> 1:49:44.600
 not by those whose eyes are glued to the scoreboard.
