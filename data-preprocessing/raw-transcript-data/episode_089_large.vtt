00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
 The following is a conversation with Stephen Wolfram, a computer scientist, mathematician,

00:04.480 --> 00:10.560
 and theoretical physicist who is the founder and CEO of Wolfram Research, a company behind

00:10.560 --> 00:16.960
 Mathematica, Wolfram Alpha, Wolfram Language, and the new Wolfram Physics Project. He's the author

00:16.960 --> 00:23.520
 of several books including A New Kind of Science, which on a personal note was one of the most

00:23.520 --> 00:29.200
 influential books in my journey in computer science and artificial intelligence. It made

00:29.200 --> 00:33.280
 me fall in love with the mathematical beauty and power of cellular automata.

00:34.400 --> 00:40.960
 It is true that perhaps one of the criticisms of Stephen is on a human level, that he has a big

00:40.960 --> 00:46.000
 ego, which prevents some researchers from fully enjoying the content of his ideas.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.400
 We talk about this point in this conversation. To me, ego can lead you astray but can also be

00:52.400 --> 00:59.040
 a superpower, one that fuels bold, innovative thinking that refuses to surrender to the cautious

00:59.040 --> 01:05.440
 ways of academic institutions. And here, especially, I ask you to join me in looking

01:05.440 --> 01:12.080
 past the peculiarities of human nature and opening your mind to the beauty of ideas in Stephen's work

01:12.080 --> 01:17.920
 and in this conversation. I believe Stephen Wolfram is one of the most original minds of our time

01:17.920 --> 01:24.080
 and, at the core, is a kind, curious, and brilliant human being. This conversation was recorded in

01:24.080 --> 01:29.680
 November 2019 when the Wolfram Physics Project was underway but not yet ready for public

01:29.680 --> 01:36.240
 exploration as it is now. We now agreed to talk again, probably multiple times in the near future,

01:36.240 --> 01:39.760
 so this is round one, and stay tuned for round two soon.

02:37.360 --> 02:41.920
 that the order execution algorithm that works behind the scenes to create the abstraction of

02:41.920 --> 02:47.200
 fractional orders is an algorithmic marvel. So big props to the Cash App engineers for

02:47.200 --> 02:52.240
 solving a hard problem that in the end provides an easy interface that takes a step up to the

02:52.240 --> 02:57.840
 next layer of abstraction over the stock market. This makes trading more accessible for new

04:14.240 --> 04:20.400
 with Stephen Wolfram. You and your son Christopher helped create the alien language in the movie

04:20.400 --> 04:27.200
 Arrival. So let me ask maybe a bit of a crazy question, but if aliens were to visit us on earth,

04:27.200 --> 04:30.480
 do you think we would be able to find a common language?

04:31.920 --> 04:37.120
 Well, by the time we're saying aliens are visiting us, we've already prejudiced the whole story

04:37.600 --> 04:43.920
 because the concept of an alien actually visiting, so to speak, we already know they're kind of

04:44.640 --> 04:49.600
 things that make sense to talk about visiting. So we already know they exist in the same kind

04:49.600 --> 04:59.360
 of physical setup that we do. It's not just radio signals. It's an actual thing that shows up and so

04:59.360 --> 05:07.360
 on. So I think in terms of can one find ways to communicate? Well, the best example we have of

05:07.360 --> 05:13.360
 this right now is AI. I mean, that's our first sort of example of alien intelligence. And the

05:13.360 --> 05:19.360
 question is, how well do we communicate with AI? If you were in the middle of a neural network,

05:19.360 --> 05:25.120
 a neural net, and you open it up and it's like, what are you thinking? Can you discuss things

05:25.120 --> 05:32.320
 with it? It's not easy, but it's not absolutely impossible. So I think by the time, given the

05:32.320 --> 05:38.720
 setup of your question, aliens visiting, I think the answer is yes, one will be able to find some

05:38.720 --> 05:43.200
 form of communication, whatever communication means. Communication requires notions of purpose

05:43.200 --> 05:46.880
 and things like this. It's a kind of philosophical quagmire.

05:46.880 --> 05:54.480
 So if AI is a kind of alien life form, what do you think visiting looks like? So if we look at

05:55.200 --> 06:01.200
 aliens visiting, and we'll get to discuss computation and the world of computation,

06:01.200 --> 06:05.680
 but if you were to imagine, you said you already prejudiced something by saying you visit,

06:06.320 --> 06:08.800
 but how would aliens visit?

06:09.440 --> 06:15.120
 By visit, there's kind of an implication. And here we're using the imprecision of human language,

06:15.120 --> 06:19.840
 you know, in a world of the future. And if that's represented in computational language,

06:19.840 --> 06:26.000
 we might be able to take the concept visit and go look in the documentation, basically,

06:26.000 --> 06:29.440
 and find out exactly what does that mean, what properties does it have, and so on.

06:29.440 --> 06:36.800
 But by visit, in ordinary human language, I'm kind of taking it to be there's something,

06:36.800 --> 06:42.880
 a physical embodiment that shows up in a spacecraft, since we kind of know that that's

06:42.880 --> 06:49.840
 necessary. We're not imagining it's just, you know, photons showing up in a radio signal that,

06:51.040 --> 06:55.040
 you know, photons in some very elaborate pattern, we're imagining it's physical

06:55.680 --> 06:58.720
 things made of atoms and so on, that show up.

06:58.720 --> 07:00.400
 Can it be photons in a pattern?

07:01.120 --> 07:05.040
 Well, that's a good question. I mean, whether there is the possibility,

07:05.040 --> 07:11.440
 you know, what counts as intelligence? Good question. I mean, it's, you know, and I

07:11.440 --> 07:15.760
 used to think there was sort of a, oh, there'll be, you know, it'll be clear what it means to

07:15.760 --> 07:20.320
 find extraterrestrial intelligence, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. I've increasingly realized,

07:20.320 --> 07:24.880
 as a result of science that I've done, that there really isn't a bright line between

07:24.880 --> 07:28.240
 the intelligent and the merely computational, so to speak.

07:28.960 --> 07:33.200
 So, you know, in our kind of everyday sort of discussion, we'll say things like, you know,

07:33.200 --> 07:38.960
 the weather has a mind of its own. Well, let's unpack that question. You know, we realize

07:38.960 --> 07:44.080
 that there are computational processes that go on that determine the fluid dynamics of this and

07:44.080 --> 07:49.360
 that and the atmosphere, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. How do we distinguish that from

07:49.360 --> 07:53.520
 the processes that go on in our brains of, you know, the physical processes that go on in our

07:53.520 --> 08:00.640
 brains? How do we separate those? How do we say the physical processes going on that represent

08:00.640 --> 08:05.120
 sophisticated computations in the weather, oh, that's not the same as the physical processes

08:05.120 --> 08:09.040
 that go on that represent sophisticated computations in our brains? The answer is,

08:09.040 --> 08:14.320
 I don't think there is a fundamental distinction. I think the distinction for us is that there's

08:14.320 --> 08:21.280
 kind of a thread of history and so on that connects kind of what happens in different brains

08:21.280 --> 08:26.000
 to each other, so to speak. And it's a, you know, what happens in the weather is something which is

08:26.000 --> 08:32.960
 not connected by sort of a thread of civilizational history, so to speak, to what we're used to.

08:32.960 --> 08:37.920
 SL. In the stories that the human brains told us, but maybe the weather has its own stories.

08:37.920 --> 08:43.440
 MG. Absolutely. Absolutely. And that's where we run into trouble thinking about extraterrestrial

08:43.440 --> 08:49.280
 intelligence because, you know, it's like that pulsar magnetosphere that's generating these very

08:49.280 --> 08:53.840
 elaborate radio signals. You know, is that something that we should think of as being this

08:53.840 --> 08:58.960
 whole civilization that's developed over the last however long, you know, millions of years of

08:58.960 --> 09:06.560
 processes going on in the neutron star or whatever versus what, you know, what we're used to in human

09:06.560 --> 09:11.600
 intelligence? I mean, I think in the end, you know, when people talk about extraterrestrial

09:11.600 --> 09:16.480
 intelligence and where is it and the whole, you know, Fermi paradox of how come there's no other

09:17.280 --> 09:23.440
 signs of intelligence in the universe, my guess is that we've got sort of two alien forms of

09:23.440 --> 09:30.240
 intelligence that we're dealing with, artificial intelligence and sort of physical or extraterrestrial

09:30.240 --> 09:35.440
 intelligence. And my guess is people will sort of get comfortable with the fact that both of these

09:35.440 --> 09:41.760
 have been achieved around the same time. And in other words, people will say, well, yes, we're

09:41.760 --> 09:47.040
 used to computers, things we've created, digital things we've created, being sort of intelligent

09:47.040 --> 09:51.360
 like we are. And they'll say, oh, we're kind of also used to the idea that there are things around

09:51.360 --> 09:57.760
 the universe that are kind of intelligent like we are, except they don't share the sort of

09:57.760 --> 10:04.800
 civilizational history that we have. And so they're a different branch. I mean, it's similar to when

10:04.800 --> 10:10.640
 you talk about life, for instance. I mean, you kind of said life form, I think almost synonymously

10:10.640 --> 10:18.640
 with intelligence, which I don't think is, you know, the AIs would be upset to hear you equate

10:18.640 --> 10:25.040
 those two things. Because I really probably implied biological life. But you're saying,

10:25.040 --> 10:29.120
 I mean, we'll explore this more, but you're saying it's really a spectrum and it's all just

10:29.120 --> 10:37.440
 a kind of computation. And so it's a full spectrum and we just make ourselves special by weaving a

10:37.440 --> 10:43.040
 narrative around our particular kinds of computation. Yes. I mean, the thing that I think I've kind of

10:43.040 --> 10:48.080
 come to realize is, you know, at some level, it's a little depressing to realize that there's so

10:48.080 --> 10:52.400
 little or liberating. Well, yeah, but I mean, it's, you know, it's the story of science,

10:52.400 --> 10:56.880
 right? And, you know, from Copernicus on, it's like, you know, first we were like,

10:56.880 --> 11:01.840
 convinced our planets at the center of the universe. No, that's not true. Well, then we

11:01.840 --> 11:06.080
 were convinced there's something very special about the chemistry that we have as biological

11:06.080 --> 11:11.600
 organisms. That's not really true. And then we're still holding out that hope. Oh, this intelligence

11:11.600 --> 11:17.600
 thing we have, that's really special. I don't think it is. However, in a sense, as you say,

11:17.600 --> 11:22.800
 it's kind of liberating for the following reason, that you realize that what's special is the

11:22.800 --> 11:31.280
 details of us, not some abstract attribute that, you know, we could wonder, oh, is something else

11:31.280 --> 11:36.640
 going to come along and, you know, also have that abstract attribute? Well, yes, every abstract

11:36.640 --> 11:42.880
 attribute we have, something else has it. But the full details of our kind of history of our

11:42.880 --> 11:48.400
 civilization and so on, nothing else has that. That's what, you know, that's our story, so to

11:48.400 --> 11:56.160
 speak. And that's sort of almost by definition, special. So I view it as not being such a, I mean,

11:56.160 --> 12:01.760
 initially I was like, this is bad. This is kind of, you know, how can we have self respect about

12:02.800 --> 12:08.000
 the things that we do? Then I realized the details of the things we do, they are the story.

12:08.000 --> 12:15.200
 Everything else is kind of a blank canvas. So maybe on a small tangent, you just made me

12:15.200 --> 12:20.560
 think of it, but what do you make of the monoliths in 2001 Space Odyssey in terms of

12:21.360 --> 12:28.000
 aliens communicating with us and sparking the kind of particular intelligent computation that

12:28.000 --> 12:37.200
 we humans have? Is there anything interesting to get from that sci fi? Yeah, I mean, I think what's

12:37.200 --> 12:42.160
 fun about that is, you know, the monoliths are these, you know, one to four to nine perfect

12:42.160 --> 12:48.880
 cuboid things. And in the Earth a million years ago, whatever they were portraying with a bunch

12:48.880 --> 12:55.920
 of apes and so on, a thing that has that level of perfection seems out of place. It seems very kind

12:55.920 --> 13:02.320
 of constructed, very engineered. So that's an interesting question. What is the, you know,

13:02.320 --> 13:07.760
 what's the techno signature, so to speak? What is it that you see it somewhere and you say,

13:07.760 --> 13:15.200
 my gosh, that had to be engineered. Now, the fact is we see crystals, which are also very perfect.

13:15.200 --> 13:19.200
 And, you know, the perfect ones are very perfect. They're nice polyhedral or whatever.

13:20.160 --> 13:27.040
 And so in that sense, if you say, well, it's a sign of sort of it's a techno signature that

13:27.040 --> 13:34.560
 it's a perfect polygonal shape, polyhedral shape. That's not true. And so then it's an interesting

13:34.560 --> 13:41.600
 question. What is the right signature? I mean, like, you know, Gauss, famous mathematician,

13:41.600 --> 13:46.240
 you know, he had this idea, you should cut down the Siberian forest in the shape of sort of a

13:46.240 --> 13:51.680
 typical image of the proof of the Pythagorean theorem on the grounds that it was a kind of

13:51.680 --> 13:57.040
 cool idea, didn't get done. But, you know, it's on the grounds that the Martians would see that and

13:57.040 --> 14:02.960
 realize, gosh, there are mathematicians out there. It's kind of, you know, in his theory of the world,

14:02.960 --> 14:07.280
 that was probably the best advertisement for the cultural achievements of our species.

14:08.560 --> 14:16.000
 But, you know, it's a reasonable question. What do you, what can you send or create that is a sign

14:16.000 --> 14:22.720
 of intelligence in its creation or even intention in its creation? You talk about if we were to send

14:22.720 --> 14:30.640
 a beacon. Can you what should we send? Is math our greatest creation? Is what is our greatest

14:30.640 --> 14:36.160
 creation? I think I think it's a it's a philosophically doomed issue. I mean, in other

14:36.160 --> 14:42.000
 words, you send something, you think it's fantastic, but it's kind of like we are part of

14:42.000 --> 14:46.160
 the universe. We make things that are, you know, things that happen in the universe.

14:47.040 --> 14:53.680
 Computation, which is sort of the thing that we are in some abstract sense using to create all

14:53.680 --> 15:01.120
 these elaborate things we create, is surprisingly ubiquitous. In other words, we might have thought

15:01.120 --> 15:06.880
 that, you know, we've built this whole giant engineering stack that's led us to microprocessors,

15:06.880 --> 15:13.200
 that's led us to be able to do elaborate computations. But this idea that computations

15:13.200 --> 15:18.400
 are happening all over the place. The only question is whether whether there's a thread that connects

15:18.400 --> 15:24.880
 our human intentions to what those computations are. And so I think I think this question of what

15:24.880 --> 15:32.160
 do you send to kind of show off our civilization in the best possible way? I think any kind of

15:32.160 --> 15:38.480
 almost random slab of stuff we've produced is about equivalent to everything else. I think

15:38.480 --> 15:44.480
 it's one of these things where it's a non romantic way of phrasing it. I just started to interrupt,

15:44.480 --> 15:51.360
 but I just talked to Andrew in who's the wife of Carl Sagan. And so I don't know if you're

15:51.360 --> 15:57.120
 familiar with the Voyager. I mean, she was part of sending, I think, brainwaves of, you know,

15:57.120 --> 16:03.680
 wasn't it hers? Her brainwaves when she was first falling in love with Carl Sagan. It's

16:03.680 --> 16:11.280
 this beautiful story that perhaps you would shut down the power of that by saying we might

16:11.280 --> 16:16.480
 as well send anything else. And that's interesting. All of it is kind of an interesting, peculiar

16:16.480 --> 16:21.280
 thing. Yeah, yeah, right. Well, I mean, I think it's kind of interesting to see on the Voyager,

16:21.280 --> 16:25.680
 you know, golden record thing. One of the things that's kind of cute about that is, you know,

16:25.680 --> 16:31.760
 it was made when was it in the late 70s, early 80s. And, you know, one of the things, it's a

16:31.760 --> 16:37.760
 phonograph record. Okay. And it has a diagram of how to play a phonograph record. And, you know,

16:37.760 --> 16:43.680
 it's kind of like it's shocking that in just 30 years, if you show that to a random kid of today,

16:43.680 --> 16:47.520
 and you show them that diagram, I've tried this experiment, they're like, I don't know what the

16:47.520 --> 16:52.880
 heck this is. And the best anybody can think of is, you know, take the whole record, forget the

16:52.880 --> 16:58.080
 fact that it has some kind of helical track in it, just image the whole thing and see what's there.

16:58.080 --> 17:03.760
 That's what we would do today. In only 30 years, our technology has kind of advanced to the point

17:03.760 --> 17:09.520
 where the playing of a helical, you know, mechanical track on a phonograph record is now

17:09.520 --> 17:17.120
 something bizarre. So, you know, it's a cautionary tale, I would say, in terms of the ability to make

17:17.120 --> 17:23.760
 something that in detail sort of leads by the nose, some, you know, the aliens or whatever,

17:23.760 --> 17:29.840
 to do something. It's like, no, you know, best you can do, as I say, if we were doing this today,

17:29.840 --> 17:35.840
 we would not build a helical scan thing with a needle. We would just take some high resolution

17:35.840 --> 17:40.560
 imaging system and get all the bits off it and say, oh, it's a big nuisance that they put in a

17:40.560 --> 17:49.120
 helix, you know, in a spiral. Let's just unravel the spiral and start from there.

17:49.120 --> 17:56.560
 SL. Do you think, and this will get into trying to figure out interpretability of AI,

17:56.560 --> 18:02.400
 interpretability of computation, being able to communicate with various kinds of computations,

18:02.400 --> 18:08.320
 do you think we'd be able to, if you put your alien hat on, figure out this record,

18:08.320 --> 18:10.240
 how to play this record?

18:10.240 --> 18:13.760
 MG. Well, it's a question of what one wants to do. I mean,

18:13.760 --> 18:19.760
 SL. Understand what the other party was trying to communicate or understand anything about the

18:19.760 --> 18:20.240
 other party.

18:20.240 --> 18:24.480
 MG. What does understanding mean? I mean, that's the issue. The issue is, it's like when people

18:24.480 --> 18:30.640
 were trying to do natural language understanding for computers, right? So people tried to do that

18:30.640 --> 18:36.960
 for years. It wasn't clear what it meant. In other words, you take your piece of English or whatever,

18:36.960 --> 18:43.040
 and you say, gosh, my computer has understood this. Okay, that's nice. What can you do with that?

18:43.040 --> 18:51.760
 Well, so for example, when we built WolfMalpha, one of the things was it's doing question answering

18:51.760 --> 18:56.720
 and so on, and it needs to do natural language understanding. The reason that I realized after

18:56.720 --> 19:01.840
 the fact, the reason we were able to do natural language understanding quite well, and people

19:01.840 --> 19:07.440
 hadn't before, the number one thing was we had an actual objective for the natural language

19:07.440 --> 19:12.240
 understanding. We were trying to turn the natural language into this computational language

19:12.240 --> 19:16.960
 that we could then do things with. Now, similarly, when you imagine your alien, you say,

19:16.960 --> 19:21.840
 okay, we're playing them the record. Did they understand it? Well, it depends what you mean.

19:23.040 --> 19:28.400
 If there's a representation that they have, if it converts to some representation where we can say,

19:28.400 --> 19:35.600
 oh yes, that's a representation that we can recognize is represents understanding, then all

19:35.600 --> 19:41.280
 well and good. But actually, the only ones that I think we can say would represent understanding

19:41.280 --> 19:46.960
 are ones that will then do things that we humans kind of recognize as being useful to us.

19:47.520 --> 19:53.360
 Maybe you're trying to understand, quantify how technologically advanced this particular

19:53.360 --> 20:00.000
 civilization is. So are they a threat to us from a military perspective? That's probably the

20:00.560 --> 20:05.280
 first kind of understanding they'll be interested in. Gosh, that's so hard. That's like in the

20:05.280 --> 20:11.760
 Arrival movie, that was one of the key questions is, why are you here, so to speak? Are you going

20:11.760 --> 20:17.920
 to hurt us? But even that, it's very unclear. It's like, are you going to hurt us? That comes

20:17.920 --> 20:24.240
 back to a lot of interesting AI ethics questions, because we might make an AI that says, well,

20:24.240 --> 20:29.840
 take autonomous cars, for instance. Are you going to hurt us? Well, let's make sure you only drive

20:29.840 --> 20:33.360
 at precisely the speed limit, because we want to make sure we don't hurt you, so to speak.

20:36.240 --> 20:39.280
 But you say, but actually, that means I'm going to be really late for this thing, and

20:40.000 --> 20:46.320
 that sort of hurts me in some way. So it's hard to know. Even the definition of what it means to

20:46.320 --> 20:54.240
 hurt someone is unclear. And as we start thinking about things about AI ethics and so on, that's

20:54.240 --> 20:58.720
 something one has to address. There's always tradeoffs, and that's the annoying thing about

20:58.720 --> 21:03.600
 ethics. Yeah, well, right. And I think ethics, like these other things we're talking about,

21:03.600 --> 21:10.480
 is a deeply human thing. There's no abstract, let's write down the theorem that proves that

21:10.480 --> 21:17.200
 this is ethically correct. That's a meaningless idea. You have to have a ground truth, so to

21:17.200 --> 21:23.920
 speak, that's ultimately what humans want, and they don't all want the same thing. So that gives

21:23.920 --> 21:28.960
 one all kinds of additional complexity in thinking about that. One convenient thing in terms of

21:28.960 --> 21:35.360
 turning ethics into computation, you can ask the question of what maximizes the likelihood of the

21:35.360 --> 21:42.960
 survival of the species. That's a good existential issue. But then when you say survival of the

21:42.960 --> 21:52.080
 species, you might say, you might, for example, let's say, forget about technology, just hang out

21:52.080 --> 21:58.400
 and be happy, live our lives, go on to the next generation, go through many, many generations

21:58.400 --> 22:05.280
 where, in a sense, nothing is happening. Is that okay? Is that not okay? Hard to know. In terms of

22:05.280 --> 22:14.560
 the attempt to do elaborate things and the attempt to might be counterproductive for the survival of

22:14.560 --> 22:23.040
 the species. It's also a little bit hard to know, so okay, let's take that as a sort of thought

22:23.040 --> 22:30.080
 experiment. You can say, well, what are the threats that we might have to survive? The

22:30.080 --> 22:37.040
 super volcano, the asteroid impact, all these kinds of things. Okay, so now we inventory these

22:37.040 --> 22:41.600
 possible threats and we say, let's make our species as robust as possible relative to all

22:41.600 --> 22:51.680
 these threats. I think in the end, it's sort of an unknowable thing what it takes. So given that

22:51.680 --> 22:58.880
 you've got this AI and you've told it, maximize the long term. What does long term mean? Does

22:58.880 --> 23:05.920
 long term mean until the sun burns out? That's not going to work. Does long term mean next thousand

23:05.920 --> 23:12.640
 years? Okay, they're probably optimizations for the next thousand years. It's like if you're

23:12.640 --> 23:16.720
 running a company, you can make a company be very stable for a certain period of time.

23:16.720 --> 23:25.440
 Like if your company gets bought by some private investment group, then you can run a company just

23:25.440 --> 23:33.200
 fine for five years by just taking what it does and removing all R&D and the company will burn

23:33.200 --> 23:38.000
 out after a while, but it'll run just fine for a little while. So if you tell the AI, keep the

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
 humans okay for a thousand years, there's probably a certain set of things that one would do to

23:42.000 --> 23:46.720
 optimize that, many of which one might say, well, that would be a pretty big shame for the future of

23:46.720 --> 23:51.520
 history, so to speak, for that to be what happens. But I think in the end, as you start thinking

23:51.520 --> 24:00.320
 about that question, what you realize is there's a whole sort of raft of undecidability, computational

24:00.320 --> 24:08.880
 irreducibility. In other words, one of the good things about what our civilization has gone

24:08.880 --> 24:13.920
 through and what we humans go through is that there's a certain computational irreducibility

24:13.920 --> 24:18.320
 to it in the sense that it isn't the case that you can look from the outside and just say,

24:18.320 --> 24:22.320
 the answer is going to be this. At the end of the day, this is what's going to happen.

24:22.320 --> 24:28.560
 You actually have to go through the process to find out. And I think that feels better in the

24:28.560 --> 24:38.800
 sense that something is achieved by going through all of this process. But it also means

24:38.800 --> 24:44.960
 that telling the AI, go figure out what will be the best outcome. Well, unfortunately, it's going

24:44.960 --> 24:50.400
 to come back and say, it's kind of undecidable what to do. We'd have to run all of those scenarios

24:51.120 --> 24:57.040
 to see what happens. And if we want it for the infinite future, we're thrown immediately into

24:57.040 --> 25:02.160
 sort of standard issues of kind of infinite computation and so on. So yeah, even if you

25:02.160 --> 25:07.680
 get that the answer to the universe and everything is 42, you still have to actually run the universe.

25:07.680 --> 25:16.640
 Yes, to figure out the question, I guess, or the journey is the point.

25:16.640 --> 25:23.360
 Right. Well, I think it's saying to summarize, this is the result of the universe. If that is

25:23.360 --> 25:29.440
 possible, it tells us, I mean, the whole sort of structure of thinking about computation and so on

25:29.440 --> 25:35.280
 and thinking about how stuff works. If it's possible to say, and the answer is such and such,

25:35.280 --> 25:40.320
 you're basically saying there's a way of going outside the universe. And you're getting yourself

25:40.320 --> 25:46.400
 into something of a sort of paradox because you're saying, if it's knowable what the answer is, then

25:46.400 --> 25:52.400
 there's a way to know it that is beyond what the universe provides. But if we can know it, then

25:52.400 --> 25:58.240
 something that we're dealing with is beyond the universe. So then the universe isn't the universe,

25:58.240 --> 26:07.440
 so to speak. And in general, as we'll talk about, at least for our small human brains, it's

26:08.320 --> 26:15.760
 hard to show the result of a sufficiently complex computation. I mean, it's probably impossible,

26:15.760 --> 26:25.040
 right, on this side ability. And the universe appears by at least the poets to be sufficiently

26:25.040 --> 26:30.960
 complex. They won't be able to predict what the heck it's all going to. Well, we better not be

26:30.960 --> 26:36.240
 able to, because if we can, it kind of denies. I mean, it's you know, we're part of the universe.

26:36.240 --> 26:42.000
 Yeah. So what does it mean for us to predict? It means that we that our little part of the universe

26:42.000 --> 26:48.720
 is able to jump ahead of the whole universe. And this this quickly winds up. I mean, that it is

26:48.720 --> 26:54.640
 conceivable. The only way we'd be able to predict is if we are so special in the universe, we are

26:54.640 --> 27:00.080
 the one place where there is computation more special, more sophisticated than anything else

27:00.080 --> 27:05.600
 that exists in the universe. That's the only way we would have the ability to sort of the almost

27:05.600 --> 27:12.400
 theological ability, so to speak, to predict what happens in the universe is to say somehow we're

27:12.400 --> 27:17.840
 better than everything else in the universe, which I don't think is the case. Yeah, perhaps we can

27:17.840 --> 27:26.160
 detect a large number of looping patterns that reoccur throughout the universe and fully describe

27:26.160 --> 27:31.440
 them. And therefore, but then it still becomes exceptionally difficult to see how those patterns

27:31.440 --> 27:37.600
 interact and what kind of well, look, the most remarkable thing about the universe is that it's

27:37.600 --> 27:43.440
 has regularity at all. Might not be the case. If you just have regularity, do you? Absolutely.

27:43.440 --> 27:50.160
 That fits full of I mean, physics is successful. You know, it's full of of laws that tell us a lot

27:50.160 --> 27:54.640
 of detail about how the universe works. I mean, it could be the case that, you know, the 10 to the

27:54.640 --> 27:58.960
 90th particles in the universe, they will do their own thing, but they don't. They all follow. We

27:58.960 --> 28:04.880
 already know they all follow basically physical, the same physical laws. And that's something

28:04.880 --> 28:10.400
 that's a very profound fact about the universe. What conclusion you draw from that is unclear. I

28:10.400 --> 28:16.240
 mean, in the, you know, the early early theologians, that was, you know, exhibit number one for the

28:16.240 --> 28:22.320
 existence of God. Now, you know, people have different conclusions about it. But the fact is,

28:22.320 --> 28:26.800
 you know, right now, I mean, I happen to be interested, actually, I've just restarted a

28:26.800 --> 28:32.800
 long running kind of interest of mine about fundamental physics. I'm kind of like, come on,

28:32.800 --> 28:39.200
 I'm on a bit of a quest, which I'm about to make more public, to see if I can actually find the

28:39.200 --> 28:46.160
 fundamental theory of physics. Excellent. We'll come to that. And I just had a lot of conversations

28:46.160 --> 28:52.000
 with quantum mechanics folks with so I'm really excited on your take, because I think you have a

28:52.000 --> 28:59.440
 fascinating take on the the fundamental nature of our reality from a physics perspective. So

28:59.440 --> 29:06.000
 and what might be underlying the kind of physics as we think of it today. Okay, let's take a step

29:06.000 --> 29:13.760
 back. What is computation? It's a good question. Operationally, computation is following rules.

29:15.120 --> 29:20.800
 That's kind of it. I mean, computation is the result is the process of systematically following

29:20.800 --> 29:26.800
 rules. And it is the thing that happens when you do that. So taking initial conditions are taking

29:26.800 --> 29:33.520
 inputs and following rules. I mean, what are you following rules on? So there has to be some data,

29:33.520 --> 29:40.000
 some unnecessarily, it can be something where there's a, you know, very simple input. And then

29:40.000 --> 29:44.400
 you're following these rules. And you'd say there's not really much data going into this.

29:44.400 --> 29:51.360
 It's you could actually pack the initial conditions into the rule, if you want to. So I think the

29:51.360 --> 29:55.840
 question is, is there a robust notion of computation? That is, what does robust mean?

29:55.840 --> 29:59.200
 What I mean by that is something like this. So So one of the things in a different in another

29:59.200 --> 30:07.040
 physics, something like energy, okay, the different forms of energy, there's, but somehow energy is a

30:07.040 --> 30:15.360
 robust concept that doesn't, isn't particular to kinetic energy, or, you know, nuclear energy,

30:15.360 --> 30:19.040
 or whatever else, there's a robust idea of energy. So one of the things you might ask is,

30:19.040 --> 30:24.560
 is the robust idea of computation? Or does it matter that this computation is running in a

30:24.560 --> 30:30.480
 Turing machine? This computation is running in a, you know, CMOS, silicon, CPU, this computation is

30:30.480 --> 30:35.040
 running in a fluid system in the weather, those kinds of things? Or is there a robust idea of

30:35.040 --> 30:43.120
 computation that transcends the sort of detailed framework that it's running in? Okay. And is there?

30:43.120 --> 30:48.240
 Yes. I mean, it wasn't obvious that there was. So it's worth understanding the history and how we

30:48.240 --> 30:55.360
 got to where we are right now. Because, you know, to say that there is, is a statement in part about

30:55.360 --> 31:00.960
 our universe. It's not a statement about what is mathematically conceivable. It's about what

31:00.960 --> 31:08.880
 actually can exist for us. Maybe you can also comment because energy, as a concept is robust.

31:08.880 --> 31:19.440
 But there's also its intricate, complicated relationship with matter, with mass, is very

31:19.840 --> 31:27.600
 interesting, of particles that carry force and particles that sort of particles that carry force

31:27.600 --> 31:33.520
 and particles that have mass. These kinds of ideas, they seem to map to each other, at least

31:33.520 --> 31:41.040
 in the mathematical sense. Is there a connection between energy and mass and computation? Or are

31:41.040 --> 31:46.400
 these completely disjoint ideas? We don't know yet. The things that I'm trying to do about fundamental

31:46.400 --> 31:53.840
 physics may well lead to such a connection, but there is no known connection at this time.

31:53.840 --> 32:00.640
 So can you elaborate a little bit more on what, how do you think about computation? What is

32:00.640 --> 32:05.040
 computation? What is computation? Yeah. So I mean, let's, let's tell a little bit of a historical

32:05.040 --> 32:12.880
 story. Okay. So, you know, back, go back 150 years, people were making mechanical calculators of

32:12.880 --> 32:16.960
 various kinds. And, you know, the typical thing was you want an adding machine, you go to the

32:16.960 --> 32:20.960
 adding machine store, basically, you want a multiplying machine, you go to the multiplying

32:20.960 --> 32:26.160
 machine store, they're different pieces of hardware. And so that means that, at least at the

32:26.160 --> 32:31.200
 level of that kind of computation, and those kinds of pieces of hardware, there isn't a robust notion

32:31.200 --> 32:35.120
 of computation, there's the adding machine kind of computation, there's the multiplying machine

32:35.680 --> 32:41.840
 notion of computation, and they're disjoint. So what happened in around 1900, people started

32:41.840 --> 32:46.080
 imagining, particularly in the context of mathematical logic, could you have something

32:46.080 --> 32:52.000
 which would be represent any reasonable function, right? And they came up with things, this idea of

32:52.000 --> 32:57.760
 primitive recursion was one of the early ideas. And it didn't work. There were reasonable functions

32:57.760 --> 33:03.040
 that people could come up with that were not represented using the primitives of primitive

33:03.040 --> 33:11.920
 recursion. Okay, so then, then along comes 1931, and Godel's theorem, and so on. And as in looking

33:11.920 --> 33:17.760
 back, one can see that as part of the process of establishing Godel's theorem, Godel basically

33:17.760 --> 33:24.720
 showed how you could compile arithmetic, how you could basically compile logical statements like

33:24.720 --> 33:29.840
 this statement is unprovable into arithmetic. So what he essentially did was to show that

33:29.840 --> 33:36.240
 arithmetic can be a computer in a sense that's capable of representing all kinds of other things.

33:36.960 --> 33:42.400
 And then Turing came along 1936, came up with Turing machines. Meanwhile, Alonzo Church had

33:42.400 --> 33:47.520
 come up with lambda calculus. And the surprising thing that was established very quickly is the

33:47.520 --> 33:52.400
 Turing machine idea about what might be what computation might be is exactly the same as the

33:52.400 --> 33:58.000
 lambda calculus idea of what computation might be. And so, and then there started to be other ideas,

33:58.000 --> 34:03.040
 you know, register machines, other kinds of other kinds of representations of computation.

34:03.040 --> 34:08.000
 And the big surprise was, they all turned out to be equivalent. So in other words, it might have

34:08.000 --> 34:12.160
 been the case, like those old adding machines and multiplying machines, that, you know, Turing had

34:12.160 --> 34:16.960
 his idea of computation, Church had his idea of computation, and they were just different. But it

34:16.960 --> 34:26.320
 isn't true. They're actually all equivalent. So then by, I would say the 1970s or so in sort of

34:26.320 --> 34:30.720
 the computation, computer science, computation theory area, people had sort of said, oh,

34:30.720 --> 34:36.480
 Turing machines are kind of what computation is. Physicists were still holding out saying, no,

34:36.480 --> 34:40.240
 no, no, that's just not how the universe works. We've got all these differential equations.

34:40.240 --> 34:43.520
 We've got all these real numbers that have infinite numbers of digits.

34:43.520 --> 34:45.200
 The universe is not a Turing machine.

34:45.200 --> 34:51.520
 Right. The, you know, the Turing machines are a small subset of the things that we make in

34:51.520 --> 34:56.880
 microprocessors and engineering structures and so on. So probably actually through my work in the

34:56.880 --> 35:04.640
 1980s about sort of the relationship between computation and models of physics, it became a

35:04.640 --> 35:12.080
 little less clear that there would be, that there was this big sort of dichotomy between what can

35:12.080 --> 35:18.000
 happen in physics and what happens in things like Turing machines. And I think probably by now people

35:18.000 --> 35:23.200
 would mostly think, and by the way, brains were another kind of element of this. I mean, you know,

35:23.200 --> 35:28.400
 Gödel didn't think that his notion of computation or what amounted to his notion of computation

35:28.400 --> 35:35.280
 would cover brains. And Turing wasn't sure either. But although he was a little bit,

35:35.280 --> 35:44.080
 he got to be a little bit more convinced that it should cover brains. But I would say by probably

35:44.080 --> 35:49.040
 sometime in the 1980s, there was beginning to be sort of a general belief that yes, this notion

35:49.040 --> 35:54.400
 of computation that could be captured by things like Turing machines was reasonably robust.

35:54.960 --> 36:01.840
 Now, the next question is, okay, you can have a universal Turing machine that's capable of

36:01.840 --> 36:08.320
 being programmed to do anything that any Turing machine can do. And, you know, this idea of

36:08.320 --> 36:12.960
 universal computation, it's an important idea, this idea that you can have one piece of hardware

36:12.960 --> 36:17.840
 and program it with different pieces of software. You know, that's kind of the idea that launched

36:17.840 --> 36:22.560
 most modern technology. I mean, that's kind of, that's the idea that launched computer revolution

36:22.560 --> 36:29.200
 software, etc. So important idea. But the thing that's still kind of holding out from that idea

36:29.200 --> 36:35.760
 is, okay, there is this universal computation thing, but seems hard to get to. It seems like

36:35.760 --> 36:40.320
 you want to make a universal computer, you have to kind of have a microprocessor with, you know,

36:40.320 --> 36:45.520
 a million gates in it, and you have to go to a lot of trouble to make something that achieves that

36:45.520 --> 36:52.480
 level of computational sophistication. Okay, so the surprise for me was that stuff that I discovered

36:52.480 --> 36:58.320
 in the early 80s, looking at these things called cellular automata, which are really simple

36:58.320 --> 37:04.640
 computational systems, the thing that was a big surprise to me was that even when their rules were

37:04.640 --> 37:09.120
 very, very simple, they were doing things that were as sophisticated as they did when their rules

37:09.120 --> 37:14.080
 were much more complicated. So it didn't look like, you know, this idea, oh, to get sophisticated

37:14.080 --> 37:21.360
 computation, you have to build something with very sophisticated rules. That idea didn't seem to pan

37:21.360 --> 37:26.480
 out. And instead, it seemed to be the case that sophisticated computation was completely ubiquitous,

37:26.480 --> 37:31.680
 even in systems with incredibly simple rules. And so that led to this thing that I call the

37:31.680 --> 37:37.280
 principle of computational equivalence, which basically says, when you have a system that

37:37.280 --> 37:44.080
 follows rules of any kind, then whenever the system isn't doing things that are, in some sense,

37:44.080 --> 37:51.760
 obviously simple, then the computation that the behavior of the system corresponds to is of

37:51.760 --> 37:56.880
 equivalence sophistication. So that means that when you kind of go from the very, very, very

37:56.880 --> 38:02.240
 simplest things you can imagine, then quite quickly, you hit this kind of threshold above

38:02.240 --> 38:07.280
 which everything is equivalent in its computational sophistication. Not obvious that would be the case.

38:07.280 --> 38:14.080
 I mean, that's a science fact. Well, no, hold on a second. So this you've opened with a new kind

38:14.080 --> 38:20.160
 of science. I mean, I remember it was a huge eye opener that such simple things can create such

38:20.160 --> 38:26.560
 complexity. And yes, there's an equivalence, but it's not a fact. It just appears to, I mean,

38:26.560 --> 38:36.880
 it's as much as a fact as sort of these theories are so elegant that it seems to be the way things

38:36.880 --> 38:43.520
 are. But let me ask sort of, you just brought up previously, kind of like the communities of

38:43.520 --> 38:49.920
 computer scientists with their Turing machines, the physicists with their universe, and whoever

38:49.920 --> 38:55.760
 the heck, maybe neuroscientists looking at the brain. What's your sense in the equivalence?

38:56.800 --> 39:06.080
 You've shown through your work that simple rules can create equivalently complex Turing machine

39:06.080 --> 39:16.080
 systems, right? Is the universe equivalent to the kinds of Turing machines? Is the human brain

39:16.080 --> 39:21.360
 a kind of Turing machine? Do you see those things basically blending together? Or is there still a

39:21.360 --> 39:26.880
 mystery about how disjoint they are? Well, my guess is that they all blend together, but we don't know

39:26.880 --> 39:33.360
 that for sure yet. I mean, this, you know, I should say, I said rather glibly that the principle of

39:33.360 --> 39:40.480
 computational equivalence is sort of a science fact. And I was using air quotes for the science fact,

39:40.480 --> 39:50.720
 because when you, it is a, I mean, just to talk about that for a second. The thing is that it has

39:50.720 --> 39:57.280
 a complicated epistemological character, similar to things like the second law of thermodynamics,

39:57.280 --> 40:03.920
 the law of entropy increase. What is the second law of thermodynamics? Is it a law of nature? Is

40:03.920 --> 40:10.080
 it a thing that is true of the physical world? Is it something which is mathematically provable? Is

40:10.080 --> 40:15.200
 it something which happens to be true of the systems that we see in the world? Is it, in some

40:15.200 --> 40:21.280
 sense, a definition of heat, perhaps? Well, it's a combination of those things. And it's the same

40:21.280 --> 40:25.120
 thing with the principle of computational equivalence. And in some sense, the principle

40:25.120 --> 40:30.000
 of computational equivalence is at the heart of the definition of computation, because it's telling

40:30.000 --> 40:35.760
 you there is a thing, there is a robust notion that is equivalent across all these systems and

40:35.760 --> 40:41.120
 doesn't depend on the details of each individual system. And that's why we can meaningfully talk

40:41.120 --> 40:46.640
 about a thing called computation. And we're not stuck talking about, oh, there's computation in

40:46.640 --> 40:52.720
 Turing machine number 3785, and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. That's why there is a robust

40:52.720 --> 40:57.120
 notion like that. Now, on the other hand, can we prove the principle of computational equivalence?

40:57.120 --> 41:03.280
 Can we prove it as a mathematical result? Well, the answer is, actually, we've got some nice results

41:03.280 --> 41:10.000
 along those lines that say, throw me a random system with very simple rules. Well, in a couple

41:10.000 --> 41:16.640
 of cases, we now know that even the very simplest rules we can imagine of a certain type are

41:16.640 --> 41:22.160
 universal and do follow what you would expect from the principle of computational equivalence. So

41:22.160 --> 41:27.040
 that's a nice piece of sort of mathematical evidence for the principle of computational equivalence.

41:27.040 --> 41:34.560
 Just to link on that point, the simple rules creating sort of these complex behaviors. But

41:35.280 --> 41:43.760
 is there a way to mathematically say that this behavior is complex? That you've mentioned that

41:43.760 --> 41:49.680
 you cross a threshold. Right. So there are various indicators. So, for example, one thing would be,

41:49.680 --> 41:55.280
 is it capable of universal computation? That is, given the system, do there exist initial

41:55.280 --> 42:00.480
 conditions for the system that can be set up to essentially represent programs to do anything you

42:00.480 --> 42:05.840
 want, to compute primes, to compute pi, to do whatever you want? Right. So that's an indicator.

42:05.840 --> 42:13.120
 So we know in a couple of examples that, yes, the simplest candidates that could conceivably have

42:13.120 --> 42:16.960
 that property do have that property. And that's what the principle of computational equivalence

42:16.960 --> 42:24.480
 might suggest. But this principle of computational equivalence, one question about it is, is it true

42:24.480 --> 42:29.200
 for the physical world? It might be true for all these things we come up with, the Turing machines,

42:29.200 --> 42:36.240
 the cellular automata, whatever else. Is it true for our actual physical world? Is it true for the

42:36.800 --> 42:42.000
 brains, which are an element of the physical world? We don't know for sure. And that's not the

42:42.000 --> 42:48.160
 type of question that we will have a definitive answer to, because there's a sort of scientific

42:48.160 --> 42:52.720
 induction issue. You can say, well, it's true for all these brains, but this person over here is

42:52.720 --> 42:59.840
 really special, and it's not true for them. And the only way that that cannot be what happens is

43:00.560 --> 43:06.160
 if we finally nail it and actually get a fundamental theory for physics, and it turns out

43:06.160 --> 43:11.520
 to correspond to, let's say, a simple program. If that is the case, then we will basically have

43:11.520 --> 43:16.240
 reduced physics to a branch of mathematics, in the sense that we will not be, you know,

43:16.240 --> 43:20.320
 right now with physics, we're like, well, this is the theory that, you know, this is the rules that

43:20.320 --> 43:28.080
 apply here. But in the middle of that, you know, right by that black hole, maybe these rules don't

43:28.080 --> 43:32.480
 apply and something else applies. And there may be another piece of the onion that we have to peel

43:32.480 --> 43:38.000
 back. But if we can get to the point where we actually have, this is the fundamental theory of

43:38.000 --> 43:44.640
 physics, here it is, it's this program, run this program, and you will get our universe, then we've

43:44.640 --> 43:50.480
 kind of reduced the problem of figuring out things in physics to a problem of doing some, what turns

43:50.480 --> 43:56.160
 out to be very difficult, irreducibly difficult, mathematical problems. But it no longer is the

43:56.160 --> 44:00.400
 case that we can say that somebody can come in and say, whoops, you know, you will write about

44:00.400 --> 44:04.880
 all these things about Turing machines, but you're wrong about the physical universe, we know

44:04.880 --> 44:09.520
 there's sort of ground truth about what's happening in the physical universe. Now, I happen to think,

44:09.520 --> 44:13.600
 I mean, you asked me at an interesting time, because I'm just in the middle of starting to

44:14.160 --> 44:22.800
 to re energize my, my project to kind of study fundamental theory of physics. As of today, I'm

44:22.800 --> 44:27.200
 very optimistic that we're actually going to find something and that it's going to be possible to

44:27.200 --> 44:31.520
 to see that the universe really is computational in that sense. But I don't know, because we're

44:31.520 --> 44:36.960
 betting against, you know, we're betting against the universe, so to speak. And I didn't, you know,

44:36.960 --> 44:41.840
 it's not like, you know, when I spend a lot of my life building technology, and then I know what

44:41.840 --> 44:46.160
 what's in there, right? And it's there may be, it may have unexpected behavior, may have bugs,

44:46.160 --> 44:50.000
 things like that. But fundamentally, I know what's in there for the universe. I'm not in

44:50.000 --> 44:57.600
 that position, so to speak. What kind of computation do you think the fundamental laws of

44:57.600 --> 45:05.280
 physics might emerge from? Just to clarify, so you've done a lot of fascinating work with kind

45:05.280 --> 45:11.840
 of discrete kinds of computation that, you know, you can sell your automata, and we'll talk about

45:11.840 --> 45:17.840
 it, have this very clean structures, it's such a nice way to demonstrate that simple rules

45:17.840 --> 45:26.000
 can create immense complexity. But what kind, you know, is that actually, are cellular automata

45:26.000 --> 45:32.080
 sufficiently general to describe the kinds of computation that might create the laws of physics?

45:32.080 --> 45:37.360
 Just to give, can you give a sense of what kind of computation do you think would create?

45:37.360 --> 45:42.240
 Well, so this is a slightly complicated issue, because as soon as you have universal

45:42.240 --> 45:45.680
 computation, you can, in principle, simulate anything with anything.

45:45.680 --> 45:51.200
 Right. But it is not a natural thing to do. And if you're asking, were you to try to find our

45:51.200 --> 45:56.240
 physical universe by looking at possible programs in the computational universe of all possible

45:56.240 --> 46:03.040
 programs, would the ones that correspond to our universe be small and simple enough that we might

46:03.040 --> 46:07.840
 find them by searching that computational universe? We got to have the right basis, so to speak. We

46:07.840 --> 46:12.560
 have to have the right language, in effect, for describing computation for that to be feasible.

46:12.560 --> 46:16.400
 So the thing that I've been interested in for a long time is, what are the most structuralist

46:16.400 --> 46:21.920
 structures that we can create with computation? So in other words, if you say a cellular automaton,

46:21.920 --> 46:26.800
 it has a bunch of cells that are arrayed on a grid, and it's very, you know, and every cell is

46:26.800 --> 46:32.800
 updated in synchrony at a particular, you know, when there's a click of a clock, so to speak,

46:32.800 --> 46:38.960
 and it goes a tick of a clock, and every cell gets updated at the same time. That's a very specific

46:38.960 --> 46:45.040
 very rigid kind of thing. But my guess is that when we look at physics, and we look at things

46:45.040 --> 46:51.440
 like space and time, that what's underneath space and time is something as structuralist as possible,

46:51.440 --> 46:58.080
 that what we see, what emerges for us as physical space, for example, comes from something that is

46:58.080 --> 47:04.080
 sort of arbitrarily unstructured underneath. And so I've been for a long time interested in kind

47:04.080 --> 47:10.000
 of what are the most structuralist structures that we can set up. And actually, what I had thought

47:10.000 --> 47:16.480
 about for ages is using graphs, networks, where essentially, so let's talk about space, for

47:16.480 --> 47:22.640
 example. So what is space? It's a kind of a question one might ask. Back in the early days

47:22.640 --> 47:27.280
 of quantum mechanics, for example, people said, oh, for sure, space is going to be discrete,

47:27.280 --> 47:30.800
 because all these other things we're finding are discrete. But that never worked out in physics.

47:30.800 --> 47:35.840
 And so space in physics today is always treated as this continuous thing, just like Euclid

47:35.840 --> 47:41.280
 imagined it. I mean, the very first thing Euclid says in his sort of common notions is,

47:41.280 --> 47:45.920
 you know, a point is something which has no part. In other words, there are points that are

47:45.920 --> 47:51.440
 arbitrarily small, and there's a continuum of possible positions of points. And the question

47:51.440 --> 47:56.400
 is, is that true? And so for example, if we look at, I don't know, fluid like air or water,

47:56.400 --> 48:01.120
 we might say, oh, it's a continuous fluid. We can pour it, we can do all kinds of things continuously.

48:01.120 --> 48:04.560
 But actually, we know, because we know the physics of it, that it consists of a bunch

48:04.560 --> 48:10.400
 of discrete molecules bouncing around, and only in the aggregate is it behaving like a continuum.

48:10.400 --> 48:14.880
 And so the possibility exists that that's true of space too. People haven't managed to make that

48:14.880 --> 48:22.000
 work with existing frameworks in physics. But I've been interested in whether one can imagine that

48:22.000 --> 48:27.840
 underneath space, and also underneath time, is something more structureless. And the question is,

48:27.840 --> 48:32.800
 is it computational? So there are a couple of possibilities. It could be computational,

48:32.800 --> 48:37.360
 somehow fundamentally equivalent to a Turing machine, or it could be fundamentally not. So

48:37.360 --> 48:42.000
 how could it not be? It could not be, so a Turing machine essentially deals with integers, whole

48:42.000 --> 48:47.440
 numbers, at some level. And you know, it can do things like it can add one to a number, it can do

48:47.440 --> 48:53.920
 things like this. And it can also store whatever the heck it did. Yes, it has an infinite storage.

48:53.920 --> 49:01.840
 But when one thinks about doing physics, or sort of idealized physics, or idealized mathematics,

49:02.480 --> 49:07.680
 one can deal with real numbers, numbers with an infinite number of digits, numbers which are

49:07.680 --> 49:12.240
 absolutely precise. And one can say, we can take this number and we can multiply it by itself.

49:12.240 --> 49:13.760
 Are you comfortable with infinity?

49:13.760 --> 49:19.040
 In this context? Are you comfortable in the context of computation? Do you think infinity

49:19.040 --> 49:25.920
 plays a part? I think that the role of infinity is complicated. Infinity is useful in conceptualizing

49:25.920 --> 49:31.920
 things. It's not actualizable. Almost by definition, it's not actualizable. But do you

49:31.920 --> 49:38.240
 think infinity is part of the thing that might underlie the laws of physics? I think that no.

49:38.240 --> 49:46.560
 I think there are many questions that you ask about, you might ask about physics, which inevitably

49:46.560 --> 49:51.760
 involve infinity. Like when you say, you know, is faster than light travel possible? You could say,

49:53.360 --> 49:58.640
 given the laws of physics, can you make something even arbitrarily large, even quote, infinitely

49:58.640 --> 50:04.800
 large, that will make faster than light travel possible? Then you're thrown into dealing with

50:04.800 --> 50:10.480
 infinity as a kind of theoretical question. But I mean, talking about sort of what's underneath

50:10.480 --> 50:18.160
 space and time and how one can make a computational infrastructure, one possibility is that you can't

50:18.160 --> 50:23.760
 make a computational infrastructure in a Turing machine sense, that you really have to be dealing

50:23.760 --> 50:28.640
 with precise real numbers. You're dealing with partial differential equations, which have

50:29.200 --> 50:33.600
 precise real numbers at arbitrarily closely separated points. You have a continuum for

50:33.600 --> 50:38.560
 everything. Could be that that's what happens, that there's sort of a continuum for everything

50:38.560 --> 50:42.400
 and precise real numbers for everything. And then the things I'm thinking about are wrong.

50:42.960 --> 50:49.600
 And that's the risk you take if you're trying to sort of do things about nature,

50:49.600 --> 50:55.520
 is you might just be wrong. For me personally, it's kind of a strange thing. I've spent a lot

50:55.520 --> 51:00.400
 of my life building technology where you can do something that nobody cares about,

51:00.400 --> 51:04.720
 but you can't be sort of wrong in that sense, in the sense you build your technology and it does

51:04.720 --> 51:10.480
 what it does. But I think this question of what the sort of underlying computational

51:10.480 --> 51:17.840
 infrastructure for the universe might be, it's sort of inevitable it's going to be fairly abstract,

51:17.840 --> 51:22.240
 because if you're going to get all these things like there are three dimensions of space,

51:22.240 --> 51:27.360
 there are electrons, there are muons, there are quarks, there are this, you don't get to,

51:27.360 --> 51:31.920
 if the model for the universe is simple, you don't get to have sort of a line of code for

51:31.920 --> 51:38.720
 each of those things. You don't get to have sort of the muon case, the tau lepton case and so on.

51:38.720 --> 51:42.800
 Because they all have to be emergent somehow, something deeper.

51:42.800 --> 51:46.720
 Right. So that means it's sort of inevitable, it's a little hard to talk about

51:46.720 --> 51:50.160
 what the sort of underlying structuralist structure actually is.

51:50.160 --> 51:56.160
 Do you think human beings have the cognitive capacity to understand, if we're to discover it,

51:56.160 --> 52:01.600
 to understand the kinds of simple structure from which these laws can emerge?

52:01.600 --> 52:04.160
 Like, do you think that's a good question?

52:04.160 --> 52:08.240
 Well, here's what I think. I think that, I mean, I'm right in the middle of this right now.

52:08.240 --> 52:08.640
 Right.

52:08.640 --> 52:14.640
 I'm telling you that I think this, yeah, I mean, this human has a hard time understanding,

52:14.640 --> 52:18.720
 you know, a bunch of the things that are going on. But what happens in understanding is

52:18.720 --> 52:23.680
 one builds waypoints. I mean, if you said understand modern 21st century mathematics,

52:23.680 --> 52:30.240
 starting from, you know, counting back in, you know, whenever counting was invented 50,000 years

52:30.240 --> 52:36.080
 ago, whatever it was, right, that would be really difficult. But what happens is we build waypoints

52:36.080 --> 52:39.680
 that allow us to get to higher levels of understanding. And we see the same thing

52:39.680 --> 52:45.040
 happening in language. You know, when we invent a word for something, it provides kind of a cognitive

52:45.040 --> 52:50.720
 anchor, a kind of a waypoint that lets us, you know, like a podcast or something. You could be

52:50.720 --> 52:55.120
 explaining, well, it's a thing which works this way, that way, the other way. But as soon as you

52:55.120 --> 53:00.960
 have the word podcast and people kind of societally understand it, you start to be able to build on

53:00.960 --> 53:05.840
 top of that. And so I think that's kind of the story of science actually, too. I mean, science

53:05.840 --> 53:11.840
 is about building these kind of waypoints where we find this sort of cognitive mechanism for

53:11.840 --> 53:16.080
 understanding something, then we can build on top of it. You know, we have the idea of, I don't

53:16.080 --> 53:21.520
 know, differential equations we can build on top of that. We have this idea, that idea. So my hope

53:21.520 --> 53:28.160
 is that if it is the case that we have to go all the way sort of from the sand to the computer,

53:28.160 --> 53:33.200
 and there's no waypoints in between, then we're toast. We won't be able to do that.

53:33.200 --> 53:39.200
 Well, eventually we might. So if we're as clever apes are good enough at building those abstract

53:39.200 --> 53:43.760
 abstractions, eventually from sand we'll get to the computer, right? And it just might be a longer

53:43.760 --> 53:49.920
 journey. The question is whether it is something that you asked, whether our human brains will

53:49.920 --> 53:55.840
 quote, understand what's going on. And that's a different question because for that, it requires

53:55.840 --> 54:03.680
 steps from which we can construct a human understandable narrative. And that's something that

54:03.680 --> 54:10.320
 I think I am somewhat hopeful that that will be possible. Although, you know, as of literally

54:10.320 --> 54:14.480
 today, if you ask me, I'm confronted with things that I don't understand very well.

54:16.400 --> 54:21.280
 So this is a small pattern in a computation trying to understand the rules under which the

54:21.280 --> 54:28.000
 computation functions. And it's an interesting possibility under which kinds of computations

54:28.640 --> 54:30.800
 such a creature can understand itself.

54:31.600 --> 54:36.160
 My guess is that within, so we didn't talk much about computational irreducibility,

54:36.160 --> 54:39.920
 but it's a consequence of this principle of computational equivalence. And it's sort of a

54:39.920 --> 54:45.040
 core idea that one has to understand, I think, which is question is, you're doing a computation,

54:45.600 --> 54:49.840
 you can figure out what happens in the computation just by running every step in the computation and

54:49.840 --> 54:56.320
 seeing what happens. Or you can say, let me jump ahead and figure out, you know, have something

54:56.320 --> 55:01.440
 smarter that figures out what's going to happen before it actually happens. And a lot of traditional

55:01.440 --> 55:08.720
 science has been about that act of computational reducibility. It's like, we've got these equations,

55:08.720 --> 55:12.400
 and we can just solve them, and we can figure out what's going to happen. We don't have to trace

55:12.400 --> 55:15.520
 all of those steps, we just jump ahead because we solve these equations.

55:16.080 --> 55:20.080
 Okay, so one of the things that is a consequence of the principle of computational equivalence is

55:20.080 --> 55:25.120
 you don't always get to do that. Many, many systems will be computationally irreducible,

55:25.120 --> 55:28.640
 in the sense that the only way to find out what they do is just follow each step and see what

55:28.640 --> 55:34.720
 happens. Why is that? Well, if you're saying, well, we, with our brains, we're a lot smarter,

55:34.720 --> 55:38.880
 we don't have to mess around like the little cellular automaton going through and updating

55:38.880 --> 55:44.880
 all those cells. We can just use the power of our brains to jump ahead. But if the principle

55:44.880 --> 55:49.680
 of computational equivalence is right, that's not going to be correct, because it means that

55:50.480 --> 55:55.040
 there's us doing our computation in our brains, there's a little cellular automaton doing its

55:55.040 --> 55:59.840
 computation, and the principle of computational equivalence says these two computations are

55:59.840 --> 56:04.560
 fundamentally equivalent. So that means we don't get to say we're a lot smarter than the cellular

56:04.560 --> 56:09.680
 automaton and jump ahead, because we're just doing computation that's of the same sophistication as

56:09.680 --> 56:15.360
 the cellular automaton itself. That's computational reducibility. It's fascinating. And that's a

56:15.360 --> 56:22.560
 really powerful idea. I think that's both depressing and humbling and so on, that we're all,

56:22.560 --> 56:26.560
 we and the cellular automaton are the same. But the question we're talking about, the fundamental

56:26.560 --> 56:32.400
 laws of physics, is kind of the reverse question. You're not predicting what's going to happen. You

56:32.400 --> 56:38.240
 have to run the universe for that. But saying, can I understand what rules likely generated me?

56:38.240 --> 56:44.400
 I understand. But the problem is, to know whether you're right, you have to have some

56:44.400 --> 56:49.120
 computational reducibility, because we are embedded in the universe. If the only way to know whether

56:49.120 --> 56:53.840
 we get the universe is just to run the universe, we don't get to do that, because it just ran for

56:53.840 --> 57:00.080
 14.6 billion years or whatever. And we can't rerun it, so to speak. So we have to hope that

57:00.080 --> 57:06.240
 there are pockets of computational reducibility sufficient to be able to say, yes, I can recognize

57:06.240 --> 57:12.720
 those are electrons there. And I think that it's a feature of computational irreducibility. It's

57:12.720 --> 57:16.320
 sort of a mathematical feature that there are always an infinite collection of pockets of

57:16.320 --> 57:20.560
 reducibility. The question of whether they land in the right place and whether we can sort of build

57:20.560 --> 57:27.200
 a theory based on them is unclear. But to this point about whether we as observers in the universe

57:27.200 --> 57:33.360
 built out of the same stuff as the universe can figure out the universe, so to speak, that relies

57:33.360 --> 57:39.120
 on these pockets of reducibility. Without the pockets of reducibility, it won't work, can't work.

57:39.120 --> 57:45.200
 But I think this question about how observers operate, it's one of the features of science over

57:45.200 --> 57:50.960
 the last 100 years particularly, has been that every time we get more realistic about observers,

57:50.960 --> 57:56.960
 we learn a bit more about science. So for example, relativity was all about observers don't get to

57:56.960 --> 58:03.120
 say what's simultaneous with what. They have to just wait for the light signal to arrive to decide

58:03.120 --> 58:08.880
 what's simultaneous. Or for example, in thermodynamics, observers don't get to say the

58:08.880 --> 58:14.240
 position of every single molecule in a gas. They can only see the kind of large scale features,

58:14.240 --> 58:18.800
 and that's why the second law of thermodynamics, the law of entropy increase, and so on works.

58:18.800 --> 58:25.520
 If you could see every individual molecule, you wouldn't conclude something about thermodynamics.

58:25.520 --> 58:28.800
 You would conclude, oh, these molecules are just all doing these particular things. You wouldn't

58:28.800 --> 58:35.520
 be able to see this aggregate fact. So I strongly expect that, and in fact, in the theories that I

58:35.520 --> 58:42.720
 have, that one has to be more realistic about the computation and other aspects of observers

58:42.720 --> 58:46.720
 in order to actually make a correspondence between what we experience. In fact,

58:47.840 --> 58:53.040
 my little team and I have a little theory right now about how quantum mechanics may work, which is

58:53.040 --> 59:00.320
 a very wonderfully bizarre idea about how the sort of thread of human consciousness

59:00.320 --> 59:05.760
 relates to what we observe in the universe. But there's several steps to explain what that's

59:05.760 --> 59:11.600
 about. What do you make of the mess of the observer at the lower level of quantum mechanics,

59:11.600 --> 59:19.360
 sort of the textbook definition with quantum mechanics kind of says that there's some,

59:19.360 --> 59:25.600
 there's two worlds. One is the world that actually is, and the other is that's observed.

59:27.360 --> 59:34.320
 What do you make sense of that? Well, I think actually the ideas we've recently had might

59:34.320 --> 59:43.760
 actually give away into this. I don't know yet. I think it's a mess. The fact is,

59:45.440 --> 59:50.160
 one of the things that's interesting, and when people look at these models that I

59:50.160 --> 59:54.080
 started talking about 30 years ago now, they say, oh no, that can't possibly be right.

59:54.960 --> 1:00:00.400
 What about quantum mechanics? You say, okay, tell me what is the essence of quantum mechanics? What

1:00:00.400 --> 1:00:04.480
 do you want me to be able to reproduce to know that I've got quantum mechanics, so to speak?

1:00:05.200 --> 1:00:08.880
 Well, and that question comes up. It comes up very operationally actually, because we've been

1:00:08.880 --> 1:00:12.320
 doing a bunch of stuff with quantum computing. And there are all these companies that say,

1:00:12.320 --> 1:00:17.920
 we have a quantum computer. And we say, let's connect to your API and let's actually run it.

1:00:17.920 --> 1:00:22.640
 And they're like, well, maybe you shouldn't do that yet. We're not quite ready yet.

1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:26.880
 And one of the questions that I've been curious about is, if I have five minutes with a quantum

1:00:26.880 --> 1:00:31.280
 computer, how can I tell if it's really a quantum computer or whether it's a simulator at the other

1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:38.160
 end? And it turns out it's really hard. It's like a lot of these questions about what is

1:00:38.160 --> 1:00:48.480
 intelligence? What's life? It's like, are you really a quantum computer? Yes, exactly. Is it

1:00:48.480 --> 1:00:56.080
 just a simulation or is it really a quantum computer? Same issue all over again. So this

1:00:56.080 --> 1:01:01.440
 whole issue about the sort of mathematical structure of quantum mechanics and the completely

1:01:01.440 --> 1:01:08.080
 separate thing that is our experience in which we think definite things happen, whereas quantum

1:01:08.080 --> 1:01:12.400
 mechanics doesn't say definite things ever happen. Quantum mechanics is all about the amplitudes for

1:01:12.400 --> 1:01:19.520
 different things to happen, but yet our thread of consciousness operates as if definite things

1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:27.040
 are happening. Dilinga, on the point, you've kind of mentioned the structure that could

1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:33.120
 underlie everything and this idea that it could perhaps have something like a structure of a graph.

1:01:33.680 --> 1:01:39.280
 Can you elaborate why your intuition is that there's a graph structure of nodes and edges

1:01:39.280 --> 1:01:45.920
 and what it might represent? Right. Okay. So the question is, what is, in a sense,

1:01:45.920 --> 1:01:54.000
 the most structuralist structure you can imagine, right? And in fact, what I've recently realized

1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:59.440
 in the last year or so, I have a new most structuralist structure. By the way, the question

1:01:59.440 --> 1:02:04.640
 itself is a beautiful one and a powerful one in itself. So even without an answer, just the

1:02:04.640 --> 1:02:09.920
 question is a really strong question. Right. But what's your new idea? Well, it has to do with

1:02:09.920 --> 1:02:18.880
 hypergraphs. Essentially, what is interesting about the sort of model I have now is it's a

1:02:18.880 --> 1:02:23.680
 little bit like what happened with computation. Everything that I think of as, oh, well, maybe

1:02:23.680 --> 1:02:30.480
 the model is this, I discover it's equivalent. And that's quite encouraging because it's like

1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:35.520
 I could say, well, I'm going to look at trivalent graphs with three edges for each node and so on,

1:02:35.520 --> 1:02:39.920
 or I could look at this special kind of graph, or I could look at this kind of algebraic structure.

1:02:40.880 --> 1:02:47.280
 And turns out that the things I'm now looking at, everything that I've imagined that is a plausible

1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:53.600
 type of structuralist structure is equivalent to this. So what is it? Well, a typical way to think

1:02:53.600 --> 1:03:06.240
 about it is, well, so you might have some collection of tuples, collection of, let's say,

1:03:06.240 --> 1:03:15.360
 numbers. So you might have one, three, five, two, three, four, just collections of numbers,

1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:18.800
 triples of numbers, let's say, quadruples of numbers, pairs of numbers, whatever.

1:03:18.800 --> 1:03:25.280
 And you have all these sort of floating little tuples. They're not in any particular order.

1:03:25.920 --> 1:03:32.160
 And that sort of floating collection of tuples, and I told you this was abstract,

1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:39.520
 represents the whole universe. The only thing that relates them is when a symbol is the same,

1:03:40.480 --> 1:03:45.280
 it's the same, so to speak. So if you have two tuples and they contain the same symbol,

1:03:45.280 --> 1:03:48.400
 let's say at the same position of the tuple, at the first element of the tuple,

1:03:48.400 --> 1:03:53.760
 then that represents a relation. So let me try and peel this back.

1:03:53.760 --> 1:03:54.640
 Wow. Okay.

1:03:56.720 --> 1:03:58.800
 I told you it's abstract, but this is the...

1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:03.680
 So the relationship is formed by some aspect of sameness.

1:04:03.680 --> 1:04:09.440
 Right. But so think about it in terms of a graph. So a graph, a bunch of nodes,

1:04:09.440 --> 1:04:16.240
 let's say you number each node, then what is a graph? A graph is a set of pairs that say

1:04:16.240 --> 1:04:23.840
 this node has an edge connecting it to this other node. And a graph is just a collection

1:04:23.840 --> 1:04:30.000
 of those pairs that say this node connects to this other node. So this is a generalization of that,

1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:37.120
 in which instead of having pairs, you have arbitrary n tuples. That's it. That's the

1:04:37.120 --> 1:04:43.520
 whole story. And now the question is, okay, so that might represent the state of the universe.

1:04:43.520 --> 1:04:47.840
 How does the universe evolve? What does the universe do? And so the answer is

1:04:47.840 --> 1:04:54.080
 that what I'm looking at is a transformation rules on these hypergraphs. In other words,

1:04:54.080 --> 1:05:01.360
 you say this, whenever you see a piece of this hypergraph that looks like this,

1:05:02.240 --> 1:05:07.200
 turn it into a piece of hypergraph that looks like this. So on a graph, it might be when you

1:05:07.200 --> 1:05:11.520
 see the subgraph, when you see this thing with a bunch of edges hanging out in this particular way,

1:05:11.520 --> 1:05:18.400
 then rewrite it as this other graph. Okay. And so that's the whole story. So the question is

1:05:19.040 --> 1:05:26.400
 what, uh, so now you say, I mean, as I say, this is quite abstract. And one of the questions is,

1:05:27.040 --> 1:05:32.240
 uh, where do you do those updating? So you've got this giant graph. What triggers the updating,

1:05:32.240 --> 1:05:39.840
 like what's the, what's the ripple effect of it? Is it, uh, and I suspect everything's discreet

1:05:39.840 --> 1:05:45.600
 even in time. So, okay. So the question is where do you do the updates? And the answer is the rule

1:05:45.600 --> 1:05:50.960
 is you do them wherever they apply. And you do them, you do them. The order in which the updates

1:05:50.960 --> 1:05:56.400
 is done is not defined. That is the, you can do them. So there may be many possible orderings

1:05:56.400 --> 1:06:02.960
 for these updates. Now, the point is if imagine you're an observer in this universe. So, and you

1:06:02.960 --> 1:06:08.880
 say, did something get updated? Well, you don't in any sense know until you yourself have been

1:06:08.880 --> 1:06:16.480
 updated. Right. So in fact, all that you can be sensitive to is essentially the causal network

1:06:17.040 --> 1:06:24.080
 of how an event over there affects an event that's in you. That doesn't even feel like

1:06:24.080 --> 1:06:28.080
 observation. That's like, that's something else. You're just part of the whole thing.

1:06:28.080 --> 1:06:34.320
 Yes, you're part of it. But, but even to have, so the end result of that is all you're sensitive to

1:06:34.320 --> 1:06:40.880
 is this causal network of what event affects what other event. I'm not making a big statement about

1:06:40.880 --> 1:06:45.440
 sort of the structure of the observer. I'm simply saying, I'm simply making the argument that

1:06:46.480 --> 1:06:52.880
 what happens, the microscopic order of these rewrites is not something that any observer,

1:06:52.880 --> 1:06:58.800
 any conceivable observer in this universe can be affected by. Because the only thing the observer

1:06:58.800 --> 1:07:06.240
 can be affected by is this causal network of how the events in the observer are affected

1:07:06.240 --> 1:07:09.360
 by other events that happen in the universe. So the only thing you have to look at is the

1:07:09.360 --> 1:07:14.320
 causal network. You don't really have to look at this microscopic rewriting that's happening. So

1:07:14.320 --> 1:07:18.560
 these rewrites are happening wherever they, they happen wherever they feel like.

1:07:18.560 --> 1:07:26.400
 Causal network. Is there, you said that there's not really, so the idea would be an undefined,

1:07:26.400 --> 1:07:33.120
 like what gets updated? The, the sequence of things is undefined. It's a, yes. That's what

1:07:33.120 --> 1:07:37.360
 you mean by the causal network, but then the call, no, the causal network is given that an

1:07:37.360 --> 1:07:43.440
 update has happened. That's an event. Then the question is, is that event causally related to,

1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:48.720
 does that event, if that event didn't happen, then some future event couldn't happen yet.

1:07:48.720 --> 1:07:49.120
 Gotcha.

1:07:49.680 --> 1:07:54.800
 And so you build up this network of what affects what. Okay. And so what that does,

1:07:54.800 --> 1:07:59.920
 so when you build up that network, that's kind of the observable aspect of the universe in some

1:07:59.920 --> 1:08:07.120
 sense. And so then you can ask questions about, you know, how robust is that observable network

1:08:07.120 --> 1:08:10.960
 of the, what's happening in the universe. Okay. So here's where it starts getting kind of

1:08:10.960 --> 1:08:17.200
 interesting. So for certain kinds of microscopic rewriting rules, the order of rewrites does not

1:08:17.200 --> 1:08:24.160
 matter to the causal network. And so this is, okay, mathematical logic moment. This is equivalent

1:08:24.160 --> 1:08:28.480
 to the Church Rosser property or the confluence property of rewrite rules. And it's the same

1:08:28.480 --> 1:08:33.440
 reason that if you're simplifying an algebraic expression, for example, you can say, oh, let me

1:08:33.440 --> 1:08:38.000
 expand those terms out. Let me factor those pieces. Doesn't matter what order you do that in,

1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:43.760
 you'll always get the same answer. And that's, it's the same fundamental phenomenon that causes

1:08:43.760 --> 1:08:50.000
 for certain kinds of microscopic rewrite rules that causes the causal network to be independent

1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:52.160
 of the microscopic order of rewritings.

1:08:52.160 --> 1:08:53.840
 Why is that property important?

1:08:54.400 --> 1:09:02.720
 Because it implies special relativity. I mean, the reason it's important is that that property,

1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:10.480
 special relativity says you can look at these sort of, you can look at different reference frames.

1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:14.960
 You can have different, you can be looking at your notion of what space and what's time

1:09:14.960 --> 1:09:18.480
 can be different depending on whether you're traveling at a certain speed, depending on

1:09:18.480 --> 1:09:22.080
 whether you're doing this, that, and the other. But nevertheless, the laws of physics are the

1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:26.240
 same. That's what the principle of special relativity says, is the laws of physics are

1:09:26.240 --> 1:09:33.360
 the same independent of your reference frame. Well, turns out this sort of change of the

1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:37.520
 microscopic rewriting order is essentially equivalent to a change of reference frame,

1:09:37.520 --> 1:09:42.000
 or at least there's a sub part of how that works that's equivalent to change a reference frame.

1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:46.240
 So, somewhat surprisingly, and sort of for the first time in forever,

1:09:46.240 --> 1:09:52.000
 it's possible for an underlying microscopic theory to imply special relativity, to be able to derive

1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:57.920
 it. It's not something you put in as a, this is a, it's something where this other property,

1:09:57.920 --> 1:10:03.680
 causal invariance, which is also the property that implies that there's a single thread of time

1:10:03.680 --> 1:10:11.600
 in the universe. It might not be the case that that's what would lead to the possibility of an

1:10:11.600 --> 1:10:16.480
 observer thinking that definite stuff happens. Otherwise, you've got all these possible rewriting

1:10:16.480 --> 1:10:20.640
 orders, and who's to say which one occurred. But with this causal invariance property,

1:10:20.640 --> 1:10:25.840
 there's a notion of a definite thread of time. It sounds like that kind of idea of time,

1:10:25.840 --> 1:10:30.960
 even space, would be emergent from the system. Oh, yeah. No, I mean, it's not a fundamental part

1:10:30.960 --> 1:10:35.440
 of the system. No, no, it's a fundamental level. All you've got is a bunch of nodes connected by

1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:39.600
 hyper edges or whatever. So there's no time, there's no space. That's right. And

1:10:39.600 --> 1:10:44.720
 but the thing is that it's just like imagining, imagine you're just dealing with a graph. And

1:10:44.720 --> 1:10:48.320
 imagine you have something like a, you know, like a honeycomb graph, or you have a hexagon,

1:10:48.320 --> 1:10:53.520
 a bunch of hexagons. You know, that graph at a microscopic level, it's just a bunch of nodes

1:10:53.520 --> 1:10:57.600
 connected to other nodes. But at a macroscopic level, you say that looks like a honeycomb,

1:10:57.600 --> 1:11:04.000
 you know, lattice, it looks like a two dimensional, you know, manifold of some kind, it looks like a

1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:07.360
 two dimensional thing. If you connect it differently, if you just connect all the

1:11:07.360 --> 1:11:12.000
 nodes one, one to another, and kind of a sort of linked list type structure, then you'd say,

1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:16.960
 well, that looks like a one dimensional space. But at the microscopic level, all these are just

1:11:16.960 --> 1:11:22.240
 networks with nodes, the macroscopic level, they look like something that's like one of our sort

1:11:22.240 --> 1:11:27.680
 of familiar kinds of space. And it's the same thing with these hyper graphs. Now, if you ask me,

1:11:27.680 --> 1:11:33.200
 have I found one that gives me three dimensional space? The answer is not yet. So we don't know.

1:11:33.200 --> 1:11:38.000
 This is one of these things we're kind of betting against nature, so to speak. And I have no way to

1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:43.920
 know. And so there are many other properties of this kind of system that are very beautiful,

1:11:43.920 --> 1:11:48.800
 actually, and very suggestive. And it will be very elegant if this turns out to be right,

1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:53.600
 because it's very clean. I mean, you start with nothing. And everything gets built up,

1:11:53.600 --> 1:11:59.520
 everything about space, everything about time, everything about matter. It's all just emergent

1:11:59.520 --> 1:12:04.480
 from the properties of this extremely low level system. And that, that will be pretty cool if

1:12:04.480 --> 1:12:11.680
 that's the way our universe works. Now, do I on the other hand, the thing that that I find very

1:12:11.680 --> 1:12:20.080
 confusing is, let's say we succeed, let's say we can say this particular sort of hypergraph rewriting

1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:25.920
 rule gives the universe just run that hypergraph rewriting rule for enough times, and you'll get

1:12:25.920 --> 1:12:33.440
 everything, you'll get this conversation we're having, you'll get everything. It's that if we

1:12:33.440 --> 1:12:39.120
 get to that point, and we look at what is this thing, what is this rule that we just have,

1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:44.320
 that is giving us our whole universe, how do we think about that thing? Let's say, turns out the

1:12:44.320 --> 1:12:48.400
 minimal version of this, and this is kind of cool thing for a language designer like me,

1:12:48.400 --> 1:12:52.960
 the minimal version of this model is actually a single line of orphan language code.

1:12:52.960 --> 1:12:59.600
 So that's, which I wasn't sure was going to happen that way, but it's, it's a, that's, it's kind of,

1:12:59.600 --> 1:13:05.440
 no, we don't know what, we don't know what that's, that's just the framework to know the actual

1:13:05.440 --> 1:13:10.320
 particular hypergraph that might be a longer, the specification of the rules might be slightly

1:13:10.320 --> 1:13:16.560
 longer. How does that help you accept marveling in the beauty and the elegance of the simplicity

1:13:16.560 --> 1:13:20.640
 that creates the universe? That does that help us predict anything in the universe?

1:13:20.640 --> 1:13:25.040
 That does that help us predict anything? Not really because of the irreducibility.

1:13:25.040 --> 1:13:29.280
 That's correct. That's correct. But so the thing that is really strange to me,

1:13:29.280 --> 1:13:37.120
 and I haven't wrapped my, my brain around this yet is, you know, one is one keeps on realizing

1:13:37.120 --> 1:13:41.760
 that we're not special in the sense that, you know, we don't live at the center of the universe.

1:13:41.760 --> 1:13:49.280
 We don't blah, blah, blah. And yet if we produce a rule for the universe and it's quite simple,

1:13:49.280 --> 1:13:54.480
 and we can write it down and a couple of lines or something that feels very special.

1:13:54.480 --> 1:14:00.560
 How did we come to get a simple universe when many of the available universes, so to speak,

1:14:00.560 --> 1:14:05.360
 are incredibly complicated? It might be, you know, a quintillion characters long.

1:14:05.360 --> 1:14:09.440
 Why did we get one of the ones that's simple? And so I haven't wrapped my brain around that

1:14:09.440 --> 1:14:17.120
 issue yet. If indeed we are in such a simple, the universe is such a simple rule. Is it possible

1:14:17.120 --> 1:14:23.920
 that there is something outside of this that we are in a kind of what people call the simulation,

1:14:24.480 --> 1:14:29.440
 right? That we're just part of a computation that's being explored by a graduate student

1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:34.320
 in alternate universe. Well, you know, the problem is we don't get to say much about

1:14:34.320 --> 1:14:40.160
 what's outside our universe because by definition, our universe is what we exist within. Now,

1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:45.440
 can we make a sort of almost theological conclusion from being able to know how our

1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:51.360
 particular universe works? Interesting question. I don't think that if you ask the question,

1:14:52.080 --> 1:14:57.600
 could we, and it relates again to this question about extraterrestrial intelligence, you know,

1:14:57.600 --> 1:15:03.520
 we've got the rule for the universe. Was it built in on purpose? Hard to say. That's the same thing

1:15:03.520 --> 1:15:11.200
 as saying we see a signal from, you know, that we're receiving from some random star somewhere,

1:15:11.200 --> 1:15:16.240
 and it's a series of pulses. And, you know, it's a periodic series of pulses, let's say.

1:15:16.800 --> 1:15:20.400
 Was that done on purpose? Can we conclude something about the origin of that series of

1:15:20.400 --> 1:15:27.520
 pulses? Just because it's elegant does not necessarily mean that somebody created it or

1:15:27.520 --> 1:15:35.040
 that we can even comprehend. Yeah. I think it's the ultimate version of the sort of identification

1:15:35.040 --> 1:15:39.760
 of the techno signature question. It's the ultimate version of that is was our universe

1:15:39.760 --> 1:15:47.840
 a piece of technology, so to speak, and how on earth would we know? But I mean, in the kind of

1:15:47.840 --> 1:15:53.920
 crazy science fiction thing you could imagine, you could say, oh, there's going to be a signature

1:15:53.920 --> 1:15:59.520
 there. It's going to be made by so and so. But there's no way we could understand that,

1:15:59.520 --> 1:16:04.240
 so to speak, and it's not clear what that would mean. Because the universe simply,

1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:10.800
 you know, if we find a rule for the universe, we're simply saying that rule represents what

1:16:10.800 --> 1:16:16.880
 our universe does. We're not saying that that rule is something running on a big computer

1:16:16.880 --> 1:16:21.680
 and making our universe. It's just saying that represents what our universe does in the same

1:16:21.680 --> 1:16:26.320
 sense that, you know, laws of classical mechanics, differential equations, whatever they are,

1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:32.560
 represent what mechanical systems do. It's not that the mechanical systems are somehow running

1:16:32.560 --> 1:16:36.960
 solutions to those differential equations. Those differential equations are just representing the

1:16:36.960 --> 1:16:42.640
 behavior of those systems. So what's the gap in your sense to linger on the fascinating,

1:16:42.640 --> 1:16:48.720
 perhaps slightly sci fi question? What's the gap between understanding the fundamental rules that

1:16:48.720 --> 1:16:54.640
 create a universe and engineering a system, actually creating a simulation ourselves?

1:16:54.640 --> 1:17:01.200
 So you've talked about sort of, you've talked about, you know, nano engineering kind of ideas

1:17:01.200 --> 1:17:06.000
 that are kind of exciting, actually creating some ideas of computation in the physical space. How

1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:11.280
 hard is it as an engineering problem to create the universe once you know the rules that create it?

1:17:11.280 --> 1:17:16.480
 Well, that's an interesting question. I think the substrate on which the universe is operating is

1:17:16.480 --> 1:17:22.080
 not a substrate that we have access to. I mean, the only substrate we have is that same substrate

1:17:22.080 --> 1:17:26.960
 that the universe is operating in. So if the universe is a bunch of hypergraphs being rewritten,

1:17:26.960 --> 1:17:34.000
 then we get to attach ourselves to those same hypergraphs being rewritten. We don't get to,

1:17:35.360 --> 1:17:40.720
 and if you ask the question, you know, is the code clean? You know, can we write nice,

1:17:40.720 --> 1:17:46.320
 elegant code with efficient algorithms and so on? Well, that's an interesting question.

1:17:47.520 --> 1:17:51.440
 That's this question of how much computational reducibility there is in the system.

1:17:51.440 --> 1:17:55.920
 But I've seen some beautiful cellular automata that basically create copies of itself within

1:17:55.920 --> 1:18:01.280
 itself, right? So that's the question whether it's possible to create, like whether you need

1:18:01.280 --> 1:18:06.400
 to understand the substrate or whether you can. Yeah, well, right. I mean, so one of the things

1:18:06.400 --> 1:18:12.720
 that is sort of one of my slightly sci fi thoughts about the future, so to speak, is, you know,

1:18:12.720 --> 1:18:16.720
 right now, if you poll typical people, you say, do you think it's important to find the fundamental

1:18:16.720 --> 1:18:22.880
 theory of physics? You get, because I've done this poll informally, at least, it's curious,

1:18:22.880 --> 1:18:27.040
 actually, you get a decent fraction of people saying, oh, yeah, that would be pretty interesting.

1:18:27.680 --> 1:18:34.320
 I think that's becoming, surprisingly enough, more, I mean, a lot of people are interested

1:18:35.120 --> 1:18:39.600
 in physics in a way that like, without understanding it, just kind of watching

1:18:41.280 --> 1:18:46.080
 scientists, a very small number of them struggle to understand the nature of our reality.

1:18:46.080 --> 1:18:51.600
 Right. I mean, I think that's somewhat true. And in fact, in this project that I'm launching into

1:18:51.600 --> 1:18:56.160
 to try and find fundamental theory of physics, I'm going to do it as a very public project. I mean,

1:18:56.160 --> 1:19:00.240
 it's going to be live streamed and all this kind of stuff. And I don't know what will happen. It'll

1:19:00.240 --> 1:19:07.280
 be kind of fun. I mean, I think that it's the interface to the world of this project. I mean,

1:19:07.280 --> 1:19:14.160
 I figure one feature of this project is, you know, unlike technology projects that basically are what

1:19:14.160 --> 1:19:18.400
 they are, this is a project that might simply fail, because it might be the case that it generates

1:19:18.400 --> 1:19:21.920
 all kinds of elegant mathematics that has absolutely nothing to do with the physical

1:19:21.920 --> 1:19:27.680
 universe that we happen to live in. Okay, so we're talking about kind of the quest to find

1:19:27.680 --> 1:19:33.440
 the fundamental theory of physics. First point is, you know, it's turned out it's kind of hard

1:19:33.440 --> 1:19:38.080
 to find the fundamental theory of physics. People weren't sure that that would be the case. Back in

1:19:38.080 --> 1:19:44.880
 the early days of applying mathematics to science, 1600s and so on, people were like, oh, in 100 years

1:19:44.880 --> 1:19:48.800
 we'll know everything there is to know about how the universe works. Turned out to be harder than

1:19:48.800 --> 1:19:53.600
 that. And people got kind of humble at some level, because every time we got to sort of a greater

1:19:53.600 --> 1:19:58.080
 level of smallness and studying the universe, it seemed like the math got more complicated and

1:19:58.080 --> 1:20:08.080
 everything got harder. When I was a kid, basically, I started doing particle physics. And when I was

1:20:08.080 --> 1:20:14.000
 doing particle physics, I always thought finding the fundamental, fundamental theory of physics,

1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:18.880
 that's a kooky business, we'll never be able to do that. But we can operate within these

1:20:18.880 --> 1:20:23.360
 frameworks that we built for doing quantum field theory and general relativity and things like this.

1:20:23.360 --> 1:20:27.920
 And it's all good. And we can figure out a lot of stuff. Did you even at that time have a sense

1:20:27.920 --> 1:20:34.640
 that there's something behind that? Sure, I just didn't expect that. I thought in some rather un,

1:20:35.680 --> 1:20:41.120
 it's actually kind of crazy and thinking back on it, because it's kind of like there was this long

1:20:41.120 --> 1:20:44.480
 period in civilization where people thought the ancients had it all figured out, and we'll never

1:20:44.480 --> 1:20:49.840
 figure out anything new. And to some extent, that's the way I felt about physics when I was

1:20:49.840 --> 1:20:54.800
 in the middle of doing it, so to speak, was, you know, we've got quantum field theory, it's the

1:20:54.800 --> 1:20:59.440
 foundation of what we're doing. And there's, you know, yes, there's probably something underneath

1:20:59.440 --> 1:21:06.000
 this, but we'll sort of never figure it out. But then I started studying simple programs in the

1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:11.120
 computational universe, things like cellular automata and so on. And I discovered that

1:21:12.160 --> 1:21:16.800
 they do all kinds of things that were completely at odds with the intuition that I had had.

1:21:16.800 --> 1:21:22.400
 And so after that, after you see this tiny little program that does all this amazingly complicated

1:21:22.400 --> 1:21:27.360
 stuff, then you start feeling a bit more ambitious about physics and saying, maybe we could do this

1:21:27.360 --> 1:21:36.720
 for physics too. And so that got me started years ago now in this kind of idea of could we actually

1:21:36.720 --> 1:21:40.880
 find what's underneath all of these frameworks, like quantum field theory and general relativity

1:21:40.880 --> 1:21:45.200
 and so on. And people perhaps don't realize as clearly as they might that, you know, the

1:21:45.200 --> 1:21:48.800
 frameworks we're using for physics, which is basically these two things, quantum field theory,

1:21:50.480 --> 1:21:55.600
 sort of the theory of small stuff and general relativity, theory of gravitation and large stuff.

1:21:55.600 --> 1:22:01.200
 Those are the two basic theories. And they're 100 years old. I mean, general relativity was 1915,

1:22:01.200 --> 1:22:08.880
 quantum field theory, well, 1920s. So basically 100 years old. And it's been a good run. There's

1:22:08.880 --> 1:22:14.560
 a lot of stuff been figured out. But what's interesting is the foundations haven't changed

1:22:14.560 --> 1:22:19.120
 in all that period of time, even though the foundations had changed several times before

1:22:19.120 --> 1:22:25.200
 that in the 200 years earlier than that. And I think the kinds of things that I'm thinking about,

1:22:25.200 --> 1:22:29.760
 which are sort of really informed by thinking about computation and the computational universe,

1:22:29.760 --> 1:22:36.640
 it's a different foundation. It's a different set of foundations. And might be wrong. But it is at

1:22:36.640 --> 1:22:42.080
 least, you know, we have a shot. And I think it's, you know, to me, it's, you know, my personal

1:22:42.080 --> 1:22:49.520
 calculation for myself is, is, you know, if it turns out that the finding the fundamental theory

1:22:49.520 --> 1:22:54.560
 of physics, it's kind of low hanging fruit, so to speak, it'd be a shame if we just didn't think to

1:22:54.560 --> 1:22:59.680
 do it. You know, if people just said, Oh, you'll never figure that stuff out. Let's, you know,

1:22:59.680 --> 1:23:05.520
 and it takes another 200 years before anybody gets around to doing it. You know, I think it's,

1:23:06.560 --> 1:23:12.720
 I don't know how low hanging this fruit actually is. It may be, you know, it may be that it's kind

1:23:12.720 --> 1:23:18.400
 of the wrong century to do this project. I mean, I think the cautionary tale for me, you know,

1:23:18.400 --> 1:23:24.160
 I think about things that I've tried to do in technology, where people thought about doing them

1:23:24.160 --> 1:23:30.480
 a lot earlier. And my favorite example is probably Leibniz, who, who thought about making essentially

1:23:30.480 --> 1:23:36.800
 encapsulating the world's knowledge in a computational form in the late 1600s, and did a

1:23:36.800 --> 1:23:42.080
 lot of things towards that. And basically, you know, we finally managed to do this. But he was

1:23:42.080 --> 1:23:48.080
 300 years too early. And that's the that's kind of the in terms of life planning. It's kind of like,

1:23:48.080 --> 1:23:51.920
 avoid things that can't be done in your in your century, so to speak.

1:23:51.920 --> 1:24:00.640
 Yeah, timing. Timing is everything. So you think if we kind of figure out the underlying rules

1:24:00.640 --> 1:24:06.400
 that can create from which quantum field theory and general relativity can emerge,

1:24:06.400 --> 1:24:09.200
 do you think they'll help us unify it at that level of abstraction?

1:24:09.200 --> 1:24:13.120
 Oh, we'll know it completely. We'll know how that all fits together. Yes, without a question.

1:24:13.680 --> 1:24:21.680
 And I mean, it's already even the things I've already done. There are very, you know, it's very,

1:24:21.680 --> 1:24:25.920
 very elegant, actually, how things seem to be fitting together. Now, you know, is it right?

1:24:25.920 --> 1:24:33.600
 I don't know yet. It's awfully suggestive. If it isn't right, it's then the designer of the universe

1:24:33.600 --> 1:24:36.800
 should feel embarrassed, so to speak, because it's a really good way to do it.

1:24:36.800 --> 1:24:43.200
 And your intuition in terms of design universe, does God play dice? Is there is there randomness

1:24:43.200 --> 1:24:46.880
 in this thing? Or is it deterministic? So the kind of

1:24:46.880 --> 1:24:51.040
 That's a little bit of a complicated question. Because when you're dealing with these things

1:24:51.040 --> 1:24:56.160
 that involve these rewrites that have, okay, even randomness is an emergent phenomenon, perhaps.

1:24:56.160 --> 1:25:00.720
 Yes, yes. I mean, it's a yeah, well, randomness, in many of these systems,

1:25:01.280 --> 1:25:06.080
 pseudo randomness and randomness are hard to distinguish. In this particular case,

1:25:06.080 --> 1:25:10.480
 the current idea that we have about some measurement in quantum mechanics

1:25:12.480 --> 1:25:16.720
 is something very bizarre and very abstract. And I don't think I can yet

1:25:16.720 --> 1:25:22.000
 explain it without kind of yakking about very technical things. Eventually, I will be able to.

1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:30.400
 But if that's right, it's kind of a it's a weird thing, because it slices between determinism and

1:25:30.400 --> 1:25:35.360
 randomness in a weird way that hasn't been sliced before, so to speak. So like many of these

1:25:35.360 --> 1:25:40.480
 questions that come up in science, where it's like, is it this or is it that? Turns out the

1:25:40.480 --> 1:25:45.520
 real answer is it's neither of those things. It's something kind of different and sort of orthogonal

1:25:45.520 --> 1:25:52.240
 to those categories. And so that's the current, you know, this week's idea about how that might

1:25:52.240 --> 1:26:00.720
 work. But, you know, we'll see how that unfolds. I mean, there's this question about a field like

1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:06.400
 physics and sort of the quest for fundamental theory and so on. And there's both the science

1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:11.840
 of what happens and there's the sort of the social aspect of what happens. Because, you know,

1:26:11.840 --> 1:26:18.080
 in a field that is basically as old as physics, we're at, I don't know what it is, fourth generation,

1:26:18.080 --> 1:26:22.320
 I don't know, fifth generation, I don't know what generation it is of physicists. And like,

1:26:22.320 --> 1:26:27.840
 I was one of these, so to speak. And for me, the foundations were like the pyramid, so to speak,

1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:34.560
 you know, it was that way. And it was always that way. It is difficult in an old field to go back to

1:26:34.560 --> 1:26:39.840
 the foundations and think about rewriting them. It's a lot easier in young fields where you're

1:26:39.840 --> 1:26:45.200
 still dealing with the first generation of people who invented the field. And it tends to be the

1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:49.760
 case, you know, that the nature of what happens in science tends to be, you know, you'll get,

1:26:50.400 --> 1:26:56.080
 typically the pattern is some methodological advance occurs. And then there's a period of five

1:26:56.080 --> 1:27:00.480
 years, 10 years, maybe a little bit longer than that, where there's lots of things that are now

1:27:00.480 --> 1:27:06.080
 made possible by that methodological advance, whether it's, you know, I don't know, telescopes,

1:27:06.080 --> 1:27:15.440
 or whether that's some mathematical method or something. Something happens, a tool gets built,

1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:21.520
 and then you can do a bunch of stuff. And there's a bunch of low hanging fruit to be picked. And

1:27:21.520 --> 1:27:27.360
 that takes a certain amount of time. After all that low hanging fruit is picked, then it's a hard

1:27:27.360 --> 1:27:35.360
 slog for the next however many decades or century or more to get to the next sort of level at which

1:27:35.360 --> 1:27:39.840
 one could do something. And it's kind of a, and it tends to be the case that in fields that are in

1:27:39.840 --> 1:27:45.040
 that kind of, I wouldn't say cruise mode, because it's really hard work, but it's very hard work for

1:27:45.040 --> 1:27:50.560
 very incremental progress. And then in your career and some of the things you've taken on,

1:27:50.560 --> 1:27:56.800
 it feels like you're not, you haven't been afraid of the hard slog. Yeah, that's true. So it's quite

1:27:56.800 --> 1:28:03.120
 interesting, especially on the engineering, on the engineering side. On a small tangent, when you

1:28:03.120 --> 1:28:09.280
 were at Caltech, did you get to interact with Richard Feynman at all? Do you have any memories

1:28:09.280 --> 1:28:16.000
 of Richard? We worked together quite a bit, actually. In fact, both when I was at Caltech

1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:21.600
 and after I left Caltech, we were both consultants at this company called Thinking Machines Corporation,

1:28:21.600 --> 1:28:27.520
 which was just down the street from here, actually. It was ultimately an ill fated company. But I used

1:28:27.520 --> 1:28:31.760
 to say this company is not going to work with the strategy they have. And Dick Feynman always used

1:28:31.760 --> 1:28:37.280
 to say, what do we know about running companies? Just let them run their company. But anyway,

1:28:38.720 --> 1:28:44.160
 he was not into that kind of thing. And he always thought that my interest in doing things like

1:28:44.160 --> 1:28:53.520
 running companies was a distraction, so to speak. And for me, it's a mechanism to have a more

1:28:53.520 --> 1:28:58.880
 effective machine for actually getting things, figuring things out and getting things to happen.

1:28:58.880 --> 1:29:04.000
 Did he think of it, because essentially what you did with the company, I don't know if you were

1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:11.920
 thinking of it that way, but you're creating tools to empower the exploration of the

1:29:11.920 --> 1:29:18.080
 university. Do you think, did he... Did he understand that point? The point of tools of...

1:29:18.640 --> 1:29:23.920
 I think not as well as he might have done. I mean, I think that... But he was actually my

1:29:23.920 --> 1:29:30.160
 first company, which was also involved with, well, was involved with more mathematical computation

1:29:30.160 --> 1:29:37.360
 kinds of things. He was quite... He had lots of advice about the technical side of what we should

1:29:37.360 --> 1:29:42.320
 do and so on. Do you have examples, memories, or thoughts that... Oh, yeah, yeah. He had all

1:29:42.320 --> 1:29:48.160
 kinds of... Look, in the business of doing sort of... One of the hard things in math is doing

1:29:48.160 --> 1:29:53.440
 integrals and so on. And so he had his own elaborate ways to do integrals and so on. He

1:29:53.440 --> 1:29:57.280
 had his own ways of thinking about sort of getting intuition about how math works.

1:29:57.920 --> 1:30:04.560
 And so his sort of meta idea was take those intuitional methods and make a computer follow

1:30:04.560 --> 1:30:10.240
 those intuitional methods. Now, it turns out for the most part, like when we do integrals and

1:30:10.240 --> 1:30:16.480
 things, what we do is we build this kind of bizarre industrial machine that turns every integral

1:30:16.480 --> 1:30:21.920
 into products of major G functions and generates this very elaborate thing. And actually the big

1:30:21.920 --> 1:30:26.400
 problem is turning the results into something a human will understand. It's not, quote,

1:30:26.400 --> 1:30:31.600
 doing the integral. And actually, Feynman did understand that to some extent. And I'm embarrassed

1:30:31.600 --> 1:30:37.280
 to say he once gave me this big pile of, you know, calculational methods for particle physics that he

1:30:37.280 --> 1:30:41.200
 worked out in the 50s. And he said, yeah, it's more used to you than to me type thing. And I

1:30:41.200 --> 1:30:47.680
 was like, I've intended to look at it and give it back and I'm still on my files now. But that's

1:30:47.680 --> 1:30:54.240
 what happens when it's finiteness of human lives. Maybe if he'd live another 20 years, I would have

1:30:54.240 --> 1:31:03.600
 remembered to give it back. But I think that was his attempt to systematize the ways that one does

1:31:03.600 --> 1:31:08.000
 integrals that show up in particle physics and so on. Turns out the way we've actually done it

1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:10.800
 is very different from that way. What do you make of that difference,

1:31:10.800 --> 1:31:20.400
 Eugene? So Feynman was actually quite remarkable at creating sort of intuitive frameworks for

1:31:20.400 --> 1:31:27.040
 understanding difficult concepts. I'm smiling because, you know, the funny thing about him was

1:31:27.040 --> 1:31:32.560
 that the thing he was really, really, really good at is calculating stuff. But he thought that was

1:31:32.560 --> 1:31:38.160
 easy because he was really good at it. And so he would do these things where he would calculate

1:31:38.160 --> 1:31:44.160
 some, do some complicated calculation in quantum field theory, for example, come out with a result,

1:31:44.800 --> 1:31:48.160
 wouldn't tell anybody about the complicated calculation because he thought that was easy.

1:31:48.160 --> 1:31:52.320
 He thought the really impressive thing was to have this simple intuition about how

1:31:52.320 --> 1:31:58.000
 everything works. So he invented that at the end. And, you know, because he'd done this calculation

1:31:58.000 --> 1:32:02.800
 and knew how it worked, it was a lot easier. It's a lot easier to have good intuition when you know

1:32:02.800 --> 1:32:07.520
 what the answer is. And then and then he would just not tell anybody about these calculations

1:32:07.520 --> 1:32:11.920
 that he wasn't meaning that maliciously, so to speak. It's just he thought that was easy.

1:32:12.880 --> 1:32:17.120
 And and that's, you know, that led to areas where people were just completely mystified,

1:32:17.120 --> 1:32:22.000
 and they kind of followed his intuition. But nobody could tell why it worked. Because actually,

1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:25.120
 the reason it worked was because he'd done all these calculations, and he knew that it was

1:32:25.120 --> 1:32:31.440
 would work. And, you know, when I he and I worked a bit on quantum computers actually back in 1980,

1:32:31.440 --> 1:32:38.800
 81, before anybody had heard of those things. And, you know, the typical mode of I mean,

1:32:38.800 --> 1:32:42.960
 he was used to say, and I now think about this, because I'm about the age that he was when I

1:32:42.960 --> 1:32:47.520
 worked with him. And, you know, I see the people who are one third my age, so to speak.

1:32:47.520 --> 1:32:53.600
 And he was always complaining that I was one third his age, and therefore various things. But, but,

1:32:54.160 --> 1:32:59.200
 you know, he would do some calculation by by hand, you know, blackboard and things come up with some

1:32:59.200 --> 1:33:06.480
 answer. I'd say, I don't understand this. You know, I do something with a computer. And he'd say,

1:33:06.480 --> 1:33:11.280
 you know, I don't understand this. So there'd be some big argument about what was, you know,

1:33:11.280 --> 1:33:18.240
 what was going on, but but it was always some. And I think, actually, we many of the things that we

1:33:18.240 --> 1:33:23.280
 sort of realized about quantum computing, that was sort of issues that have to do particularly

1:33:23.280 --> 1:33:28.640
 with the measurement process, are kind of still issues today. And I kind of find it interesting.

1:33:28.640 --> 1:33:34.320
 It's a funny thing in science that these, you know, that there's, there's a remarkable happens

1:33:34.320 --> 1:33:39.440
 in technology to there's a remarkable sort of repetition of history that ends up occurring.

1:33:40.080 --> 1:33:45.120
 Eventually, things really get nailed down. But it often takes a while. And it often things come

1:33:45.120 --> 1:33:50.880
 back decades later. Well, for example, I could tell a story actually happened right down the

1:33:50.880 --> 1:33:56.880
 street from here. When we were both thinking machines, I had been working on this particular

1:33:56.880 --> 1:34:03.200
 cellular automaton, who rule 30, that has this feature that it from very simple initial conditions,

1:34:03.200 --> 1:34:10.000
 it makes really complicated behavior. Okay. So and actually, of all silly physical things,

1:34:11.200 --> 1:34:16.880
 using this big parallel computer called the connection machine that that company was making,

1:34:16.880 --> 1:34:22.720
 I generated this giant printout of rule 30 on very, on actually on the same kind of same kind

1:34:22.720 --> 1:34:30.320
 of printer that people use to make layouts microprocessors. So one of these big, you know,

1:34:31.200 --> 1:34:37.520
 large format printers with high resolution and so on. So okay, so print this out lots of very tiny

1:34:37.520 --> 1:34:45.120
 cells. And so there was sort of a question of how some features of that pattern. And so it was very

1:34:45.120 --> 1:34:49.600
 much a physical, you know, on the floor with meter rules trying to measure different things.

1:34:49.600 --> 1:34:55.440
 So, so Feynman kind of takes me aside, we've been doing that for a little while and takes me aside.

1:34:55.440 --> 1:35:00.560
 And he says, I just want to know this one thing says, I want to know, how did you know that this

1:35:00.560 --> 1:35:05.280
 rule 30 thing would produce all this really complicated behavior that is so complicated

1:35:05.280 --> 1:35:10.320
 that we're, you know, going around with this big printout, and so on. And I said, Well,

1:35:10.320 --> 1:35:15.760
 I didn't know, I just enumerated all the possible rules and then observed that that's what happened.

1:35:15.760 --> 1:35:21.760
 He said, Oh, I feel a lot better. You know, I thought you had some intuition that he didn't have

1:35:22.480 --> 1:35:26.640
 that would let one. I said, No, no, no, no intuition, just experimental science.

1:35:26.640 --> 1:35:33.200
 TK Oh, that's such a beautiful sort of dichotomy there of that's exactly you showed is you really

1:35:33.200 --> 1:35:37.120
 can't have an intuition about an irreducible. I mean, you have to run it.

1:35:37.120 --> 1:35:38.160
 MG Yes, that's right.

1:35:38.160 --> 1:35:41.840
 TK That's so hard for us humans, and especially brilliant

1:35:41.840 --> 1:35:50.480
 physicists like Feynman to say that you can't have a compressed, clean intuition about how the whole

1:35:50.480 --> 1:35:56.240
 thing works. MG Yes, yes. No, he was, I mean, I think he was sort of on the edge of understanding

1:35:56.240 --> 1:36:00.800
 that point about computation. And I think he found that, I think he always found computation

1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:07.200
 interesting. And I think that was sort of what he was a little bit poking at. I mean, that intuition,

1:36:07.200 --> 1:36:12.080
 you know, the difficulty of discovering things, like even you say, Oh, you know, you just

1:36:12.080 --> 1:36:16.720
 enumerate all the cases and just find one that does something interesting, right? Sounds very easy.

1:36:16.720 --> 1:36:21.760
 Turns out, like, I missed it when I first saw it, because I had kind of an intuition

1:36:21.760 --> 1:36:26.000
 that said it shouldn't be there. So I had kind of arguments, Oh, I'm going to ignore that case,

1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:32.400
 because whatever. And how did you have an open mind enough? Because you're essentially the same

1:36:32.400 --> 1:36:37.760
 person as you should find, like the same kind of physics type of thinking. How did you find yourself

1:36:37.760 --> 1:36:44.640
 having a sufficiently open mind to be open to watching rules and them revealing complexity?

1:36:44.640 --> 1:36:47.760
 MG Yeah, I think that's an interesting question. I've wondered about that myself, because it's

1:36:47.760 --> 1:36:52.560
 kind of like, you know, you live through these things, and then you say, what was the historical

1:36:52.560 --> 1:36:56.960
 story? And sometimes the historical story that you realize after the fact was not what you lived

1:36:56.960 --> 1:37:05.040
 through, so to speak. And so, you know, what I realized is, I think what happened is, you know,

1:37:05.040 --> 1:37:10.080
 I did physics, kind of like reductionistic physics, where you're thrown in the universe,

1:37:10.080 --> 1:37:15.120
 and you're told, go figure out what's going on inside it. And then I started building computer

1:37:15.120 --> 1:37:20.640
 tools. And I started building my first computer language, for example. And computer language is

1:37:20.640 --> 1:37:24.720
 not like, it's sort of like physics in the sense that you have to take all those computations

1:37:24.720 --> 1:37:30.080
 people want to do, and kind of drill down and find the primitives that they can all be made of.

1:37:30.080 --> 1:37:33.520
 But then you do something that's really different, because you're just saying,

1:37:33.520 --> 1:37:37.760
 okay, these are the primitives. Now, you know, hopefully they'll be useful to people,

1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:43.200
 let's build up from there. So you're essentially building an artificial universe, in a sense,

1:37:43.200 --> 1:37:47.280
 where you make this language, you've got these primitives, you're just building whatever you

1:37:47.280 --> 1:37:53.040
 feel like building. And so it was sort of interesting for me, because from doing science,

1:37:53.040 --> 1:37:58.720
 where you're just thrown in the universe as the universe is, to then just being told, you know,

1:37:58.720 --> 1:38:04.560
 you can make up any universe you want. And so I think that experience of making a computer language,

1:38:04.560 --> 1:38:12.800
 which is essentially building your own universe, so to speak, that's what gave me a somewhat

1:38:12.800 --> 1:38:17.760
 different attitude towards what might be possible. It's like, let's just explore what can be done in

1:38:17.760 --> 1:38:23.760
 these artificial universes, rather than thinking the natural science way of let's be constrained

1:38:23.760 --> 1:38:27.440
 by how the universe actually is. Yeah, by being able to program, essentially, you've,

1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:34.960
 as opposed to being limited to just your mind and a pen, you now have, you've basically built

1:38:34.960 --> 1:38:40.000
 another brain that you can use to explore the universe by computer program, you know,

1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:44.800
 this is kind of a brain, right? And it's well, it's it's or telescope, or you know, it's a tool,

1:38:44.800 --> 1:38:47.760
 it's it lets you let's you see stuff, but there's something fundamentally different

1:38:47.760 --> 1:38:54.480
 between a computer and a telescope. I mean, it just, yeah, I'm hoping to romanticize the notion,

1:38:54.480 --> 1:39:00.160
 but it's more general, the computer is more general. And it's, it's, I think, I mean, this

1:39:00.160 --> 1:39:07.200
 point about, you know, people say, oh, such and such a thing was almost discovered at such and

1:39:07.200 --> 1:39:12.400
 such a time, the the distance between, you know, the building the paradigm that allows you to

1:39:12.400 --> 1:39:18.080
 actually understand stuff or allows one to be open to seeing what's going on. That's really hard.

1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:24.080
 And, you know, I think, in I've been fortunate in my life that I spent a lot of my time building

1:39:24.080 --> 1:39:32.800
 computational language. And that's an activity that, in a sense, works by sort of having to

1:39:33.760 --> 1:39:39.040
 kind of create another level of abstraction and kind of be open to different kinds of structures.

1:39:39.040 --> 1:39:45.760
 But, you know, it's, it's always I mean, I'm fully aware of, I suppose, the fact that I have seen it

1:39:45.760 --> 1:39:51.760
 a bunch of times of how easy it is to miss the obvious, so to speak, that at least is factored

1:39:51.760 --> 1:39:59.280
 into my attempt to not miss the obvious, although it may not succeed. What do you think is the role

1:39:59.280 --> 1:40:08.720
 of ego in the history of math and science? And more sort of, you know, a book title is something

1:40:08.720 --> 1:40:16.240
 like a new kind of science. You've accomplished a huge amount. In fact, somebody said that Newton

1:40:16.240 --> 1:40:21.040
 didn't have an ego, and I looked into it and he had a huge ego. Yeah, but from an outsider's

1:40:21.040 --> 1:40:28.960
 perspective, some have said that you have a bit of an ego as well. Do you see it that way? Does

1:40:28.960 --> 1:40:34.960
 ego get in the way? Is it empowering? Is it both? So it's, it's, it's complicated and necessary. I

1:40:34.960 --> 1:40:39.920
 mean, you know, I've had, look, I've spent more than half my life CEO in a tech company. Right.

1:40:39.920 --> 1:40:50.080
 Okay. And, you know, that is a, I think it's actually very, it means that one's ego is not

1:40:50.080 --> 1:40:55.200
 a distant thing. It's a thing that one encounters every day, so to speak, because it's, it's all

1:40:55.200 --> 1:40:59.360
 tied up with leadership and with how one, you know, develops an organization and all these

1:40:59.360 --> 1:41:03.760
 kinds of things. So, you know, it may be that if I'd been an academic, for example, I could have

1:41:03.760 --> 1:41:09.760
 sort of, you know, check the ego, put it on, put on a shelf somewhere and ignore its characteristics,

1:41:09.760 --> 1:41:15.920
 but you're reminded of it quite often in the context of running a company. Sure. I mean,

1:41:15.920 --> 1:41:22.160
 that's what it's about. It's, it's about leadership and, you know, leadership is intimately tied to

1:41:22.160 --> 1:41:27.760
 ego. Now, what does it mean? I mean, what, what is the, you know, for me, I've been fortunate that I

1:41:27.760 --> 1:41:34.800
 think I have reasonable intellectual confidence, so to speak. That is, you know, I, I'm one of

1:41:34.800 --> 1:41:38.720
 these people who at this point, if somebody tells me something and I just don't understand it,

1:41:39.360 --> 1:41:45.520
 my conclusion isn't that means I'm dumb. That my conclusion is there's something wrong with

1:41:45.520 --> 1:41:51.120
 what I'm being told. And that was actually Dick Feynman used to have that, that that feature too,

1:41:51.120 --> 1:41:55.760
 he never really believed in. He actually believed in experts much less than I believe in experts.

1:41:55.760 --> 1:42:03.280
 So. Wow. So that's a fun, that's a, that's a fundamentally powerful property of ego and saying,

1:42:03.280 --> 1:42:12.640
 like, not that I am wrong, but that the, the world is wrong. And, and tell me, like, when confronted

1:42:12.640 --> 1:42:17.440
 with the fact that doesn't fit the thing that you've really thought through sort of both the

1:42:17.440 --> 1:42:24.240
 negative and the positive of ego, do you see the negative of that get in the way sort of being

1:42:24.240 --> 1:42:29.600
 sure of the mistakes I've made that are the results of, I'm pretty sure I'm right. And

1:42:30.240 --> 1:42:36.560
 turns out I'm not. I mean, that's, that's the, you know, but, but the thing is that the, the,

1:42:36.560 --> 1:42:42.640
 the idea that one tries to do things that, so for example, you know, one question is if people have

1:42:42.640 --> 1:42:48.960
 tried hard to do something and then one thinks, maybe I should try doing this myself. Uh, if one

1:42:48.960 --> 1:42:52.560
 does not have a certain degree of intellectual confidence, one just says, well, people have been

1:42:52.560 --> 1:42:56.880
 trying to do this for a hundred years. How am I going to be able to do this? Yeah. And, you know,

1:42:56.880 --> 1:43:02.240
 I was fortunate in the sense that I happened to start having some degree of success in science

1:43:02.240 --> 1:43:07.120
 and things when I was really young. And so that developed a certain amount of sort of intellectual

1:43:07.120 --> 1:43:12.080
 confidence. I don't think I otherwise would have had. Um, and you know, in a sense, I mean,

1:43:12.080 --> 1:43:17.600
 I was fortunate that I was working in a field, particle physics during its sort of golden age

1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:22.720
 of rapid progress. And that, that's kind of gives one a false sense of, uh, achievement because

1:43:22.720 --> 1:43:26.800
 it's kind of, kind of easy to discover stuff that's going to survive. If you happen to be,

1:43:26.800 --> 1:43:29.600
 you know, picking the low hanging fruit of a rapidly expanding field.

1:43:30.400 --> 1:43:34.800
 I mean, the reason I totally, I totally immediately understood the ego behind a new

1:43:34.800 --> 1:43:39.120
 kind of science to me, let me sort of just try to express my feelings on the whole thing,

1:43:39.680 --> 1:43:46.000
 is that if you don't allow that kind of ego, then you would never write that book.

1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:49.920
 That you would say, well, people must have done this. There's not, you would not dig.

1:43:49.920 --> 1:43:56.720
 You would not keep digging. And I think that was, I think you have to take that ego and,

1:43:56.720 --> 1:44:02.560
 and ride it and see where it takes you. And that's how you create exceptional work.

1:44:02.560 --> 1:44:07.040
 But I think the other point about that book was it was a non trivial question,

1:44:07.040 --> 1:44:12.320
 how to take a bunch of ideas that are, I think, reasonably big ideas. They might,

1:44:12.320 --> 1:44:16.880
 they might, you know, their importance is determined by what happens historically.

1:44:16.880 --> 1:44:20.720
 One can't tell how important they are. One can tell sort of the scope of them.

1:44:20.720 --> 1:44:26.000
 And the scope is fairly big and they're very different from things that have come before.

1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:31.040
 And the question is, how do you explain that stuff to people? And so I had had the experience

1:44:31.040 --> 1:44:34.880
 of sort of saying, well, there are these things, there's a cellular automaton. It does this,

1:44:34.880 --> 1:44:39.040
 it does that. And people are like, oh, it must be just like this. It must be just like that.

1:44:39.040 --> 1:44:44.080
 So no, it isn't. It's something different. Right. And so I could have done sort of,

1:44:44.080 --> 1:44:47.280
 I'm really glad you did what you did, but you could have done sort of academically,

1:44:47.280 --> 1:44:51.440
 just published, keep publishing small papers here and there. And then you would just keep

1:44:51.440 --> 1:44:55.520
 getting this kind of resistance, right? You would get like, yeah, it's supposed to just

1:44:55.520 --> 1:45:00.000
 dropping a thing that says, here it is, here's the full, the full thing.

1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:04.640
 No, I mean, that was my calculation is that basically, you know, you could introduce

1:45:04.640 --> 1:45:09.680
 little pieces. It's like, you know, one possibility is like, it's the secret weapon,

1:45:09.680 --> 1:45:13.760
 so to speak. It's this, you know, I keep on discovering these things in all these different

1:45:13.760 --> 1:45:18.640
 areas. Where'd they come from? Nobody knows. But I decided that, you know, in the interests of one

1:45:18.640 --> 1:45:24.800
 only has one life to lead and, you know, writing that book took me a decade anyway. There's not a

1:45:24.800 --> 1:45:29.200
 lot of wiggle room, so to speak. One can't be wrong by a factor of three, so to speak, in how long

1:45:29.200 --> 1:45:35.600
 it's going to take. That I, you know, I thought the best thing to do, the thing that is most sort

1:45:35.600 --> 1:45:44.400
 of, that most respects the intellectual content, so to speak, is you just put it out with as much

1:45:44.400 --> 1:45:49.360
 force as you can, because it's not something where, and, you know, it's an interesting thing.

1:45:49.360 --> 1:45:54.800
 You talk about ego and it's, you know, for example, I run a company which has my name on it,

1:45:54.800 --> 1:45:59.520
 right? I thought about starting a club for people whose companies have their names on them. And

1:45:59.520 --> 1:46:04.560
 it's a funny group because we're not a bunch of egomaniacs. That's not what it's about,

1:46:04.560 --> 1:46:09.680
 so to speak. It's about basically sort of taking responsibility for what one's doing.

1:46:10.240 --> 1:46:15.680
 And, you know, in a sense, any of these things where you're sort of putting yourself on the line,

1:46:15.680 --> 1:46:25.760
 it's kind of a funny, it's a funny dynamic because, in a sense, my company is sort of

1:46:25.760 --> 1:46:30.080
 something that happens to have my name on it, but it's kind of bigger than me and I'm kind of just

1:46:30.080 --> 1:46:35.680
 its mascot at some level. I mean, I also happen to be a pretty, you know, strong leader of it.

1:46:35.680 --> 1:46:45.920
 LW. But it's basically showing a deep, inextricable sort of investment. Your name,

1:46:45.920 --> 1:46:55.760
 like Steve Jobs's name wasn't on Apple, but he was Apple. Elon Musk's name is not on Tesla,

1:46:55.760 --> 1:47:01.840
 but he is Tesla. So it's like, it meaning emotionally. If a company succeeds or fails,

1:47:01.840 --> 1:47:07.760
 he would just that emotionally would suffer through that. And so that's, that's a beautiful

1:47:07.760 --> 1:47:12.240
 recognizing that fact. And also Wolfram is a pretty good branding name, so that works out.

1:47:12.240 --> 1:47:16.320
 LW. Yeah, right. Exactly. I think Steve had it had a bad deal there.

1:47:16.320 --> 1:47:23.760
 LR. Yeah. So you made up for it with the last name. Okay. So in 2002, you published

1:47:23.760 --> 1:47:29.920
 A New Kind of Science, to which sort of on a personal level, I can credit my love for

1:47:29.920 --> 1:47:35.680
 cellular automata and computation in general. I think a lot of others can as well. Can you

1:47:35.680 --> 1:47:45.760
 briefly describe the vision, the hope, the main idea presented in this 1200 page book?

1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:53.920
 LW. Sure. Although it took 1200 pages to say in the book. So no, the real idea, it's kind of

1:47:54.800 --> 1:47:58.800
 a good way to get into it is to look at sort of the arc of history and to look at what's happened

1:47:58.800 --> 1:48:04.080
 in kind of the development of science. I mean, there was this sort of big idea in science about

1:48:04.080 --> 1:48:10.960
 300 years ago, that was, let's use mathematical equations to try and describe things in the world.

1:48:10.960 --> 1:48:16.080
 Let's use sort of the formal idea of mathematical equations to describe what might be happening in

1:48:16.080 --> 1:48:21.520
 the world, rather than, for example, just using sort of logical augmentation and so on. Let's have

1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:27.280
 a formal theory about that. And so there'd been this 300 year run of using mathematical equations

1:48:27.280 --> 1:48:32.400
 to describe the natural world, which had worked pretty well. But I got interested in how one could

1:48:32.400 --> 1:48:38.640
 generalize that notion. There is a formal theory, there are definite rules, but what structure could

1:48:38.640 --> 1:48:44.400
 those rules have? And so what I got interested in was let's generalize beyond the sort of purely

1:48:44.400 --> 1:48:50.640
 mathematical rules. And we now have this sort of notion of programming and computing and so on.

1:48:50.640 --> 1:48:57.520
 Let's use the kinds of rules that can be embodied in programs as a sort of generalization of the

1:48:57.520 --> 1:49:04.400
 ones that can exist in mathematics as a way to describe the world. And so my kind of favorite

1:49:04.400 --> 1:49:09.840
 version of these kinds of simple rules are these things called cellular automata. And so typical

1:49:09.840 --> 1:49:16.960
 case... So wait, what are cellular automata? Fair enough. So typical case of a cellular automaton,

1:49:16.960 --> 1:49:24.640
 it's an array of cells. It's just a line of discrete cells. Each cell is either black or white.

1:49:25.360 --> 1:49:31.440
 And in a series of steps that you can represent as lines going down a page, you're updating the

1:49:31.440 --> 1:49:35.840
 color of each cell according to a rule that depends on the color of the cell above it and

1:49:35.840 --> 1:49:44.160
 to its left and right. So it's really simple. So a thing might be if the cell and its right neighbor

1:49:44.160 --> 1:49:54.960
 are not the same or the cell on the left is black or something, then make it black on the next step.

1:49:54.960 --> 1:50:01.280
 And if not, make it white. Typical rule. That rule, I'm not sure I said it exactly right,

1:50:01.280 --> 1:50:05.920
 but a rule very much like what I just said, has the feature that if you started off from just one

1:50:05.920 --> 1:50:12.800
 black cell at the top, it makes this extremely complicated pattern. So some rules you get a very

1:50:12.800 --> 1:50:19.600
 simple pattern. Some rules, the rule is simple. You start them off from a sort of simple seed.

1:50:19.600 --> 1:50:25.280
 You just get this very simple pattern. But other rules, and this was the big surprise when I

1:50:25.280 --> 1:50:30.720
 started actually just doing the simple computer experiments to find out what happens, is that they

1:50:30.720 --> 1:50:36.960
 produce very complicated patterns of behavior. So for example, this rule 30 rule has the feature

1:50:36.960 --> 1:50:43.120
 you start off from just one black cell at the top, makes this very random pattern. If you look

1:50:43.120 --> 1:50:49.120
 like at the center column of cells, you get a series of values. It goes black, white, black,

1:50:49.120 --> 1:50:56.720
 black, whatever it is. That sequence seems for all practical purposes random. So it's kind of like

1:50:56.720 --> 1:51:05.200
 in math, you compute the digits of pi, 3.1415926, whatever. Those digits once computed, I mean,

1:51:05.200 --> 1:51:09.520
 the scheme for computing pi, it's the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle,

1:51:09.520 --> 1:51:15.920
 very well defined. But yet, once you've generated those digits, they seem for all practical

1:51:15.920 --> 1:51:22.000
 purposes completely random. And so it is with rule 30, that even though the rule is very simple,

1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:28.240
 much simpler, much more sort of computationally obvious than the rule for generating digits of pi,

1:51:28.240 --> 1:51:32.960
 even with a rule that simple, you're still generating immensely complicated behavior.

1:51:32.960 --> 1:51:38.080
 Yeah. So if we could just pause on that, I think you probably have said it and looked at it so long,

1:51:38.080 --> 1:51:43.040
 you forgot the magic of it, or perhaps you don't, you still feel the magic. But to me,

1:51:43.040 --> 1:51:49.280
 if you've never seen sort of, I would say, what is it? A one dimensional, essentially,

1:51:49.280 --> 1:51:57.280
 cellular automata, right? And you were to guess what you would see if you have some

1:51:57.280 --> 1:52:04.000
 sort of cells that only respond to its neighbors. Right. If you were to guess what kind of things

1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:09.920
 you would see, like my initial guess, like even when I first like opened your book,

1:52:09.920 --> 1:52:15.920
 A New Kind of Science, right? My initial guess is you would see, I mean, it would be a very simple

1:52:15.920 --> 1:52:22.400
 stuff. Right. And I think it's a magical experience to realize the kind of complexity,

1:52:22.400 --> 1:52:27.920
 you mentioned rule 30, still your favorite cellular automaton? Still my favorite rule. Yes.

1:52:28.880 --> 1:52:35.600
 You get complexity, immense complexity, you get arbitrary complexity. Yes. And when you say

1:52:35.600 --> 1:52:44.400
 randomness down the middle column, that's just one cool way to say that there's incredible complexity.

1:52:44.400 --> 1:52:49.920
 And that's just, I mean, that's a magical idea. However, you start to interpret it,

1:52:49.920 --> 1:52:55.920
 all the reducibility discussions, all that. But it's just, I think that has profound philosophical

1:52:56.960 --> 1:53:03.040
 kind of notions around it, too. It's not just, I mean, it's transformational about how you see the

1:53:03.040 --> 1:53:07.760
 world. I think for me it was transformational. I don't know, we can have all kinds of discussion

1:53:07.760 --> 1:53:15.280
 about computation and so on, but just, you know, I sometimes think if I were on a desert island

1:53:15.280 --> 1:53:19.920
 and was, I don't know, maybe it was some psychedelics or something, but if I had to take

1:53:19.920 --> 1:53:25.680
 one book, I mean, you kind of science would be it because you could just enjoy that notion. For some

1:53:25.680 --> 1:53:30.480
 reason, it's a deeply profound notion, at least to me. I find it that way. Yeah. I mean, look, it's

1:53:30.480 --> 1:53:39.040
 been, it was a very intuition breaking thing to discover. I mean, it's kind of like, you know,

1:53:39.040 --> 1:53:43.680
 you point the computational telescope out the window and you're like, okay, I'm going to

1:53:43.680 --> 1:53:48.240
 point the computational telescope out there. And suddenly you see, I don't know, you know,

1:53:48.800 --> 1:53:52.160
 in the past, it's kind of like, you know, moons of Jupiter or something, but suddenly you see

1:53:52.160 --> 1:53:57.200
 something that's kind of very unexpected and rule 30 was very unexpected for me. And the big

1:53:57.200 --> 1:54:03.120
 challenge at a personal level was to not ignore it. I mean, people, you know, in other words,

1:54:03.120 --> 1:54:08.160
 you might say, you know, it's a bug. What would you say? Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, I,

1:54:08.160 --> 1:54:11.600
 what are we looking at by the way? Oh, well, I was just generating here. I'll actually generate

1:54:11.600 --> 1:54:18.480
 a rule 30 pattern. So that's the rule for, for rule 30. And it says, for example, it says here,

1:54:18.480 --> 1:54:22.720
 if you have a black cell in the middle and black cell to the left and white cell to the right,

1:54:22.720 --> 1:54:27.840
 then the cell on the next step will be white. And so here's the actual pattern that you get

1:54:27.840 --> 1:54:34.160
 starting off from a single black cell at the top there. And then that's the initial state initial

1:54:34.160 --> 1:54:37.840
 condition. That's the initial thing. You just start off from that and then you're going down

1:54:37.840 --> 1:54:44.480
 the page and at every, at every step, you're just applying this rule to find out the new value that

1:54:44.480 --> 1:54:50.320
 you get. And so you might think rule that simple, you got to get the, there's got to be some trace

1:54:50.320 --> 1:54:56.320
 of that simplicity here. Okay. We'll run it. Let's say for 400 steps. Um, so what it does,

1:54:56.320 --> 1:55:00.080
 it's kind of aliasing a bit on the screen there, but, but, um, you can see there's a little bit

1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:07.040
 of regularity over on the left, but there's a lot of stuff here that just looks very complicated,

1:55:07.040 --> 1:55:14.320
 very random. And, uh, that's a big sort of shock to was a big shock to my intuition, at least

1:55:14.320 --> 1:55:19.200
 that that's possible. The mind immediately starts. Is there a pattern? There must be a repetitive

1:55:19.200 --> 1:55:25.120
 pattern. There must be. So I spent, so indeed, that's what I thought at first. And I thought,

1:55:25.120 --> 1:55:29.440
 I thought, well, this is kind of interesting, but you know, if we run it long enough, we'll see,

1:55:29.440 --> 1:55:34.720
 you know, something we'll resolve into something simple. And, uh, uh, you know, I did all kinds of

1:55:34.720 --> 1:55:41.200
 analysis of using mathematics, statistics, cryptography, whatever, whatever to try and crack

1:55:41.200 --> 1:55:46.560
 it. Um, and I never succeeded. And after I hadn't succeeded for a while, I started thinking maybe

1:55:46.560 --> 1:55:52.080
 there's a real phenomenon here. That is the reason I'm not succeeding. Maybe. I mean, the thing that

1:55:52.080 --> 1:55:57.360
 for me was sort of a motivating factor was looking at the natural world and seeing all this complexity

1:55:57.360 --> 1:56:01.520
 that exists in the natural world. The question is, where does it come from? You know, what secret

1:56:01.520 --> 1:56:06.640
 does nature have that lets it make all this complexity that we humans, when we engineer

1:56:06.640 --> 1:56:11.840
 things typically are not making, we're typically making things that at least look quite simple to

1:56:11.840 --> 1:56:18.080
 us. And so the shock here was even from something very simple, you're making something that complex.

1:56:18.800 --> 1:56:24.240
 Uh, maybe this is getting at sort of the secret that nature has that allows it to make really

1:56:24.240 --> 1:56:30.480
 complex things, even though its underlying rules may not be that complex. How did it make you feel

1:56:30.480 --> 1:56:36.400
 if we, if we look at the Newton apple, was there, was it, was there a, you know, you took a walk

1:56:36.400 --> 1:56:43.120
 and, and something it profoundly hit you or was this a gradual thing, a lobster being boiled?

1:56:43.920 --> 1:56:50.320
 The truth of every sort of science discovery is it's not that gradual. I mean, I've spent,

1:56:50.320 --> 1:56:54.240
 I happen to be interested in scientific biography kinds of things. And so I've tried to track down,

1:56:54.240 --> 1:57:00.080
 you know, how did people come to figure out this or that thing? And there's always a long kind of,

1:57:00.080 --> 1:57:06.880
 uh, sort of preparatory, um, you know, there's a, there's a need to be prepared in a mindset

1:57:06.880 --> 1:57:10.320
 in which it's possible to see something. I mean, in the case of rule 30,

1:57:10.320 --> 1:57:16.560
 I was around June 1st, 1984 was, um, uh, kind of a silly story in some ways. I finally had

1:57:16.560 --> 1:57:20.800
 a high resolution laser printer. So I was able, so I thought I'm going to generate a bunch of

1:57:20.800 --> 1:57:27.200
 pictures of the cellular automata and I generate this one and I put it, I was on some plane flight

1:57:27.200 --> 1:57:32.640
 to Europe and they have this with me. And it's like, you know, I really should try to understand

1:57:32.640 --> 1:57:36.880
 this. And this is really, you know, this is, I really don't understand what's going on.

1:57:37.440 --> 1:57:43.760
 And, uh, that was kind of the, um, you know, slowly trying to, trying to see what was happening.

1:57:43.760 --> 1:57:50.240
 It was not, uh, it was depressingly unsubstantial, so to speak, in the sense that, um, a lot of these

1:57:50.240 --> 1:57:56.240
 ideas like principle of computational equivalence, for example, you know, I thought, well, that's a

1:57:56.240 --> 1:58:00.240
 possible thing. I didn't know if it's correct, still don't know for sure that it's correct.

1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:07.120
 Um, but it's sort of a gradual thing that these things gradually kind of become seem more important

1:58:07.120 --> 1:58:12.160
 than one thought. I mean, I think the whole idea of studying the computational universe of simple

1:58:12.160 --> 1:58:19.120
 programs, it took me probably a decade, decade and a half to kind of internalize that that was

1:58:19.120 --> 1:58:24.880
 really an important idea. Um, and I think, you know, if it turns out we find the whole universe

1:58:24.880 --> 1:58:29.520
 lurking out there in the computational universe, that's a good, uh, you know, it's a good brownie

1:58:29.520 --> 1:58:34.560
 point or something for the, uh, for the whole idea. But I think that the, um, the thing that's

1:58:34.560 --> 1:58:39.840
 strange in this whole question about, you know, finding this different raw material for making

1:58:39.840 --> 1:58:45.280
 models of things, um, what's been interesting sort of in the, in sort of arc of history is,

1:58:45.280 --> 1:58:49.440
 you know, for 300 years, it's kind of like the, the mathematical equations approach.

1:58:49.440 --> 1:58:53.440
 It was the winner. It was the thing, you know, you want to have a really good model for something

1:58:53.440 --> 1:58:58.960
 that's what you use. The thing that's been remarkable is just in the last decade or so,

1:58:58.960 --> 1:59:04.800
 I think one can see a transition to using not mathematical equations, but programs

1:59:04.800 --> 1:59:10.560
 as sort of the raw material for making models of stuff. And that's pretty neat. And it's kind of,

1:59:11.280 --> 1:59:15.440
 you know, as somebody who's kind of lived inside this paradigm shift, so to speak,

1:59:15.440 --> 1:59:20.640
 it is bizarre. I mean, no doubt in sort of the history of science that will be seen as an

1:59:20.640 --> 1:59:25.760
 instantaneous paradigm shift, but it sure isn't instantaneous when it's played out in one's actual

1:59:25.760 --> 1:59:32.800
 life. So to speak, it seems glacial. Um, um, and it's the kind of thing where, where it's sort of

1:59:32.800 --> 1:59:40.320
 interesting because in the dynamics of sort of the adoption of ideas like that into different fields,

1:59:40.320 --> 1:59:46.000
 the younger the field, the faster the adoption typically, because people are not kind of locked

1:59:46.000 --> 1:59:52.080
 in with the fifth generation of people who've studied this field and it is, it is the way it is

1:59:52.080 --> 1:59:57.040
 and it can never be any different. And I think that's been, um, you know, watching that process

1:59:57.040 --> 2:00:03.680
 has been interesting. I mean, I'm, I'm, I think I'm fortunate that I, I've, uh, uh, I, I do stuff

2:00:03.680 --> 2:00:09.760
 mainly cause I like doing it. And, um, uh, if I was, um, uh, that makes me kind of thick skinned

2:00:09.760 --> 2:00:16.080
 about the world's response to what I do. Um, and uh, but that's definitely, uh, you know, and anytime

2:00:16.080 --> 2:00:21.680
 you, you write a book called something like a new kind of science, um, it's kind of the, the pitch

2:00:21.680 --> 2:00:26.560
 forks will come out for the, for the old kind of science. And I was, it was interesting dynamics.

2:00:26.560 --> 2:00:34.800
 I think that the, um, um, uh, I have to say that I was fully aware of the fact that the, um, when

2:00:34.800 --> 2:00:40.560
 you see sort of incipient paradigm shifts in science, the vigor of the negative response

2:00:41.200 --> 2:00:48.960
 upon early introduction is a fantastic positive indicator of good longterm results. So in other

2:00:48.960 --> 2:00:55.440
 words, if people just don't care, it's, um, you know, that's not such a good sign. If they're

2:00:55.440 --> 2:01:01.120
 like, oh, this is great. That means you didn't really discover anything interesting. Um, what

2:01:01.120 --> 2:01:05.600
 fascinating properties of rule 30 have you discovered over the years? You've recently

2:01:05.600 --> 2:01:11.680
 announced the rule 30 prizes for solving three key problems. Can you maybe talk about interesting

2:01:11.680 --> 2:01:18.800
 properties that have been kind of revealed rule 30 or other cellular automata and what problems

2:01:18.800 --> 2:01:22.400
 are still before us? Like the three problems you've announced. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So, I mean,

2:01:24.480 --> 2:01:29.280
 the most interesting thing about cellular automata is that it's hard to figure stuff out about them.

2:01:29.280 --> 2:01:36.480
 And that's, um, uh, in a sense, every time you try and sort of, uh, uh, you try and bash them with

2:01:36.480 --> 2:01:42.400
 some other technique, you say, can I crack them? The answer is they seem to be uncrackable. They

2:01:42.400 --> 2:01:49.040
 seem to have the feature that they are, um, that they're sort of showing irreducible computation.

2:01:49.040 --> 2:01:53.920
 They're not, you're not able to say, oh, I know exactly what this is going to do. It's going to

2:01:53.920 --> 2:02:00.080
 do this or that, but there's specific formulations of that fact. Yes. Right. So, I mean, for example,

2:02:00.080 --> 2:02:05.520
 in, in rule 30, in the pattern you get just starting from a single black cell, you get this

2:02:05.520 --> 2:02:11.520
 sort of very, very sort of random looking pattern. And so one feature of that, just look at the

2:02:11.520 --> 2:02:16.800
 center column. And for example, we use that for a long time to generate randomness symbols and

2:02:16.800 --> 2:02:22.560
 language, um, just, you know, what rule 30 produces. Now the question is, can you prove

2:02:22.560 --> 2:02:27.680
 how random it is? So for example, one very simple question, can you prove that it'll never repeat?

2:02:28.560 --> 2:02:31.120
 We haven't been able to show that it will never repeat.

2:02:32.800 --> 2:02:37.520
 We know that if there are two adjacent columns, we know they can't both repeat,

2:02:37.520 --> 2:02:42.800
 but just knowing whether that center column can ever repeat, we still don't even know that. Um,

2:02:42.800 --> 2:02:48.560
 another problem that I sort of put in my collection of, you know, it's like $30,000 for

2:02:48.560 --> 2:02:54.640
 three, you know, for these three prizes for about rule 30. Um, I would say that this is not one of

2:02:54.640 --> 2:03:00.720
 those. There's one of those cases where the money is not the main point, but, um, it's just, uh,

2:03:00.720 --> 2:03:06.560
 you know, helps, um, uh, motivate somehow the, the investigation. So there's three problems

2:03:06.560 --> 2:03:12.400
 you propose to get $30,000 if you solve all three or maybe, you know, it's 10,000 for each for each.

2:03:12.400 --> 2:03:16.400
 Right. My, uh, the, the problems, that's right. Money's not the thing. The problems

2:03:16.400 --> 2:03:22.720
 themselves are just clean formulation. It's just, you know, will it ever become periodic?

2:03:22.720 --> 2:03:27.040
 Second problem is, are there an equal number of black and white cells down the middle column,

2:03:27.040 --> 2:03:31.440
 down the middle column. And the third problem is a little bit harder to state, which is essentially,

2:03:31.440 --> 2:03:37.680
 is there a way of figuring out what the color of a cell at position T down the center column is

2:03:38.320 --> 2:03:45.040
 in a, with a less computational effort than about T steps. So in other words, is there a way to jump

2:03:45.040 --> 2:03:51.680
 ahead and say, I know what this is going to do, you know, it's just some mathematical function

2:03:51.680 --> 2:03:57.680
 of T, um, or proving that there is no way or proving there is no way. Yes. But both, I mean,

2:03:57.680 --> 2:04:01.840
 you know, for any one of these, one could prove that, you know, one could discover, you know,

2:04:01.840 --> 2:04:06.880
 we know what rule 30 does for a billion steps, but, um, and maybe we'll know for a trillion steps

2:04:06.880 --> 2:04:12.160
 before too very long. Um, but maybe at a quadrillion steps, it suddenly becomes repetitive.

2:04:12.160 --> 2:04:17.120
 You might say, how could that possibly happen? But so when I was writing up these prizes,

2:04:17.120 --> 2:04:21.040
 I thought, and this is typical of what happens in the computational universe. I thought,

2:04:21.040 --> 2:04:25.360
 let me find an example where it looks like it's just going to be random forever,

2:04:25.360 --> 2:04:29.920
 but actually it becomes repetitive. And I found one and it's just, you know, I did a search,

2:04:29.920 --> 2:04:35.360
 I searched, I don't know, maybe a million different rules with some criterion. And this is

2:04:36.400 --> 2:04:41.760
 what's sort of interesting about that is I kind of have this thing that I say in a kind of silly

2:04:41.760 --> 2:04:46.000
 way about the computational universe, which is, you know, the animals are always smarter than you

2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:49.680
 are. That is, there's always some way. One of these computational systems is going to figure

2:04:49.680 --> 2:04:53.760
 out how to do something, even though I can't imagine how it's going to do it. And, you know,

2:04:53.760 --> 2:04:57.520
 I didn't think I would find one that, you know, you would think after all these years that when

2:04:57.520 --> 2:05:05.120
 I found sort of all possible things, uh, uh, uh, funky things that, um, uh, that I would have, uh,

2:05:05.120 --> 2:05:10.960
 that I would have gotten my intuition wrapped around the idea that, um, you know, these creatures

2:05:10.960 --> 2:05:15.200
 are always in the computational universe are always smarter than I'm going to be. But, uh,

2:05:15.200 --> 2:05:19.760
 well, they're equivalently as smart, right? That's correct. And that makes it,

2:05:19.760 --> 2:05:25.440
 that makes one feel very sort of, it's, it's, it's humbling every time because every time the thing

2:05:25.440 --> 2:05:29.760
 is, is, uh, you know, you think it's going to do this or it's not going to be possible to do this

2:05:29.760 --> 2:05:34.080
 and it turns out it finds a way. Of course, the promising thing is there's a lot of other rules

2:05:34.080 --> 2:05:40.480
 like rule 30. It's just rule 30 is, oh, it's my favorite cause I found it first. And that's right.

2:05:40.480 --> 2:05:44.240
 But the, the problems are focusing on rule 30. It's possible that rule 30

2:05:45.040 --> 2:05:50.480
 is, is repetitive after trillion steps and that doesn't prove anything about the other rules.

2:05:50.480 --> 2:05:56.080
 It does not. But this is a good sort of experiment of how you go about trying to prove something

2:05:56.080 --> 2:06:01.360
 about a particular rule. Yes. And it also, all these things help build intuition. That is if

2:06:01.360 --> 2:06:06.640
 it turned out that this was repetitive after a trillion steps, that's not what I would expect.

2:06:06.640 --> 2:06:11.600
 And so we learned something from that. The method to do that though, would reveal something

2:06:11.600 --> 2:06:17.440
 interesting about the, no doubt. No doubt. I mean, it's, although it's sometimes challenging,

2:06:17.440 --> 2:06:24.800
 like the, you know, I put out a prize in 2007 for, for a particular Turing machine that I,

2:06:24.800 --> 2:06:29.680
 there was the simplest candidate for being a universal Turing machine and the young chap in

2:06:29.680 --> 2:06:35.840
 England named Alex Smith, um, after a smallish number of months said, I've got a proof and

2:06:35.840 --> 2:06:40.320
 he did, you know, it took a little while to iterate, but he had a proof. Unfortunately,

2:06:40.320 --> 2:06:47.280
 the proof is very, it's, it's a lot of micro details. It's, it's not, it's not like you look

2:06:47.280 --> 2:06:53.680
 at it and you say, aha, there's a big new principle. The big new principle is the simplest

2:06:53.680 --> 2:06:58.240
 Turing machine that might have been universal actually is universal. And it's incredibly much

2:06:58.240 --> 2:07:03.040
 simpler than the Turing machines that people already knew were universal before that. And so

2:07:03.040 --> 2:07:08.240
 that intuitionally is important because it says computation universality is closer at hand than

2:07:08.240 --> 2:07:13.440
 you might've thought. Um, but the actual methods are not, uh, in that particular case,

2:07:13.440 --> 2:07:17.440
 we're not terribly illuminating. It would be nice if the methods would also be elegant.

2:07:17.440 --> 2:07:21.840
 That's true. Yeah. No, I mean, I think it's, it's one of these things where, I mean, it's,

2:07:21.840 --> 2:07:27.120
 it's like a lot of, we've talked about earlier kind of, um, you know, opening up AI's and machine

2:07:27.120 --> 2:07:32.240
 learning and things of what's going on inside and is it, is it just step by step or can you

2:07:32.240 --> 2:07:36.480
 sort of see the bigger picture more abstractly? It's unfortunate. I mean, with Fermat's last

2:07:36.480 --> 2:07:44.240
 theorem proof, it's unfortunate that the proof to such an elegant theorem is, um, is not, I mean,

2:07:44.240 --> 2:07:49.600
 it's, it's, it's not, it doesn't fit into the margins of a page. That's true. But there's no,

2:07:49.600 --> 2:07:54.720
 one of the things is that's another consequence of computational irreducibility. This, this fact

2:07:54.720 --> 2:08:00.800
 that there are even quite short results in mathematics whose proofs are arbitrarily long.

2:08:00.800 --> 2:08:05.680
 Yes. That's a, that's a consequence of all this stuff. And it's, it's a, it makes one wonder,

2:08:06.240 --> 2:08:11.120
 uh, you know, how come mathematics is possible at all? Right. Why is, you know, why is it the

2:08:11.120 --> 2:08:16.320
 case? How people managed to navigate doing mathematics through looking at things where

2:08:16.320 --> 2:08:22.640
 they're not just thrown into, it's all undecidable. Um, that's, that's its own own separate, separate

2:08:22.640 --> 2:08:29.920
 story. And that would be, that would, that would have a poetic beauty to it is if people were to

2:08:29.920 --> 2:08:36.160
 find something interesting about rule 30, because I mean, there's an emphasis to this particular

2:08:36.160 --> 2:08:41.280
 role. It wouldn't say anything about the broad irreducibility of all computations, but it would

2:08:41.280 --> 2:08:49.440
 nevertheless put a few smiles on people's faces of, uh, well, yeah. But to me, it's like in a

2:08:49.440 --> 2:08:54.400
 sense, establishing principle of computational equivalence, it's a little bit like doing

2:08:54.400 --> 2:08:59.680
 inductive science anywhere. That is the more examples you find, the more convinced you are

2:08:59.680 --> 2:09:04.160
 that it's generally true. I mean, we don't get to, you know, whenever we do natural science,

2:09:04.880 --> 2:09:10.560
 we, we say, well, it's true here that this or that happens. Can we, can we prove that it's true

2:09:10.560 --> 2:09:16.240
 everywhere in the universe? No, we can't. So, you know, it's the same thing here. We're exploring

2:09:16.240 --> 2:09:20.720
 the computational universe. We're establishing facts in the computational universe. And that's,

2:09:20.720 --> 2:09:30.720
 uh, that's sort of a way of, uh, of inductively concluding general things. Just to think through

2:09:30.720 --> 2:09:35.040
 this a little bit, we've touched on it a little bit before, but what's the difference between the

2:09:35.040 --> 2:09:40.000
 kind of computation, now that we're talking about cellular automata, what's the difference between

2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:47.600
 the kind of computation, biological systems, our mind, our bodies, the things we see before us that

2:09:47.600 --> 2:09:54.880
 emerged through the process of evolution and cellular automata? I mean, we've kind of implied

2:09:54.880 --> 2:10:01.200
 to the discussion of physics underlying everything, but we, we talked about the potential equivalents

2:10:01.200 --> 2:10:06.080
 of the fundamental laws of physics and the kind of computation going on in Turing machines.

2:10:06.080 --> 2:10:12.240
 But can you now connect that? Do you think there's something special or interesting about the kind

2:10:12.240 --> 2:10:19.520
 of computation that our bodies do? Right. Well, let's talk about brains primarily. I mean,

2:10:19.520 --> 2:10:24.480
 I think the, um, the most important thing about the things that our brains do are that we care

2:10:24.480 --> 2:10:29.760
 about them in the sense that there's a lot of computation going on out there in, you know,

2:10:29.760 --> 2:10:35.280
 cellular automata and, and, you know, physical systems and so on. And it just, it does what it

2:10:35.280 --> 2:10:40.080
 does. It follows those rules. It does what it does. The thing that's special about the computation in

2:10:40.080 --> 2:10:47.760
 our brains is that it's connected to our goals and our kind of whole societal story. And, you know,

2:10:47.760 --> 2:10:52.720
 I think that's the, that's, that's the special feature. And now the question then is when you

2:10:52.720 --> 2:10:57.680
 see this whole sort of ocean of computation out there, how do you connect that to the things that

2:10:57.680 --> 2:11:02.400
 we humans care about? And in a sense, a large part of my life has been involved in sort of the

2:11:02.400 --> 2:11:07.200
 technology of how to do that. And, you know, what I've been interested in is kind of building

2:11:07.200 --> 2:11:13.760
 computational language that allows that something that both we humans can understand and that can

2:11:13.760 --> 2:11:19.760
 be used to determine computations that are actually computations we care about. See, I think

2:11:19.760 --> 2:11:23.920
 when you look at something like one of these cellular automata and it does some complicated

2:11:23.920 --> 2:11:30.080
 thing, you say, that's fun, but why do I care? Well, you could say the same thing actually in

2:11:30.080 --> 2:11:36.000
 physics. You say, oh, I've got this material and it's a ferrite or something. Why do I care? You

2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:40.480
 know, it's some, has some magnetic properties. Why do I care? It's amusing, but why do I care?

2:11:40.480 --> 2:11:44.560
 Well, we end up caring because, you know, ferrite is what's used to make magnetic tape,

2:11:44.560 --> 2:11:49.280
 magnetic discs, whatever. Or, you know, we could use liquid crystals as made, used to make,

2:11:50.160 --> 2:11:55.520
 well, not actually increasingly not, but it has been used to make computer displays and so on.

2:11:55.520 --> 2:12:00.320
 But those are, so in a sense, we're mining these things that happen to exist in the physical

2:12:00.320 --> 2:12:05.440
 universe and making it be something that we care about because we sort of entrain it into

2:12:05.440 --> 2:12:10.640
 technology. And it's the same thing in the computational universe that a lot of what's

2:12:10.640 --> 2:12:16.880
 out there is stuff that's just happening, but sometimes we have some objective and we will

2:12:16.880 --> 2:12:20.720
 go and sort of mine the computational universe for something that's useful for some particular

2:12:20.720 --> 2:12:26.640
 objective. On a large scale, trying to do that, trying to sort of navigate the computational

2:12:26.640 --> 2:12:32.240
 universe to do useful things, you know, that's where computational language comes in. And, you

2:12:32.240 --> 2:12:37.040
 know, a lot of what I've spent time doing and building this thing we call Wolfram Language,

2:12:37.040 --> 2:12:44.960
 which I've been building for the last one third of a century now. And kind of the goal there is

2:12:44.960 --> 2:12:52.000
 to have a way to express kind of computational thinking, computational thoughts in a way that

2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:58.160
 both humans and machines can understand. So it's kind of like in the tradition of computer languages,

2:12:58.160 --> 2:13:05.040
 programming languages, that the tradition there has been more, let's take how computers are built

2:13:05.040 --> 2:13:10.480
 and let's specify, let's have a human way to specify, do this, do this, do this,

2:13:10.480 --> 2:13:15.600
 at the level of the way that computers are built. What I've been interested in is representing sort

2:13:15.600 --> 2:13:21.040
 of the whole world computationally and being able to talk about whether it's about cities or

2:13:21.040 --> 2:13:26.560
 chemicals or, you know, this kind of algorithm or that kind of algorithm, things that have come to

2:13:26.560 --> 2:13:31.360
 exist in our civilization and the sort of knowledge base of our civilization, being able to talk

2:13:31.360 --> 2:13:37.360
 directly about those in a computational language so that both we can understand it and computers

2:13:37.360 --> 2:13:42.480
 can understand it. I mean, the thing that I've been sort of excited about recently, which I had

2:13:42.480 --> 2:13:47.520
 only realized recently, which is kind of embarrassing, but it's kind of the arc of what

2:13:47.520 --> 2:13:52.640
 we've tried to do in building this kind of computational language is it's a similar kind of

2:13:52.640 --> 2:14:00.320
 arc of what happened when mathematical notation was invented. So go back 400 years, people were

2:14:00.320 --> 2:14:05.840
 trying to do math, they were always explaining their math in words, and it was pretty clunky.

2:14:06.400 --> 2:14:12.320
 And as soon as mathematical notation was invented, you could start defining things like algebra and

2:14:12.320 --> 2:14:17.120
 later calculus and so on. It all became much more streamlined. When we deal with computational

2:14:17.120 --> 2:14:22.160
 thinking about the world, there's a question of what is the notation? What is the kind of

2:14:22.160 --> 2:14:27.760
 formalism that we can use to talk about the world computationally? In a sense, that's what I've

2:14:27.760 --> 2:14:31.440
 spent the last third of a century trying to build. And we finally got to the point where

2:14:31.440 --> 2:14:35.760
 we have a pretty full scale computational language that sort of talks about the world.

2:14:36.320 --> 2:14:43.280
 And that's exciting because it means that just like having this mathematical notation, let us

2:14:43.280 --> 2:14:49.200
 talk about the world mathematically, and let us build up these kind of mathematical sciences.

2:14:49.200 --> 2:14:53.920
 Now we have a computational language which allows us to start talking about the world

2:14:53.920 --> 2:15:01.040
 computationally, and lets us, my view of it is it's kind of computational X for all X. All these

2:15:01.040 --> 2:15:06.240
 different fields of computational this, computational that. That's what we can now build.

2:15:06.240 --> 2:15:13.280
 Let's step back. So first of all, the mundane. What is Wolfram language in terms of,

2:15:13.280 --> 2:15:19.120
 I mean I can answer the question for you, but it's basically not the philosophical deep,

2:15:19.120 --> 2:15:23.440
 the profound, the impact of it. I'm talking about in terms of tools, in terms of things you can

2:15:23.440 --> 2:15:28.320
 download, in terms of stuff you can play with. What is it? What does it fit into the infrastructure?

2:15:28.320 --> 2:15:30.080
 What are the different ways to interact with it?

2:15:30.080 --> 2:15:35.280
 Right. So I mean the two big things that people have sort of perhaps heard of that come from

2:15:35.280 --> 2:15:40.400
 Wolfram language, one is Mathematica, the other is Wolfram Alpha. So Mathematica first came out

2:15:40.400 --> 2:15:49.200
 in 1988. It's this system that is basically an instance of Wolfram language, and it's used to do

2:15:49.200 --> 2:15:56.400
 computations, particularly in sort of technical areas. And the typical thing you're doing is

2:15:56.400 --> 2:16:01.440
 you're typing little pieces of computational language, and you're getting computations done.

2:16:01.440 --> 2:16:05.200
 It's very kind of, there's like a symbolic.

2:16:05.200 --> 2:16:10.000
 Yeah, it's a symbolic language.

2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:14.800
 It's a symbolic language. I mean I don't know how to cleanly express that, but that makes it very

2:16:14.800 --> 2:16:21.120
 distinct from how we think about sort of, I don't know, programming in a language like Python or

2:16:21.120 --> 2:16:21.440
 something.

2:16:21.440 --> 2:16:26.480
 Right. So the point is that in a traditional programming language, the raw material of the

2:16:26.480 --> 2:16:32.640
 programming language is just stuff that computers intrinsically do. And the point of Wolfram

2:16:32.640 --> 2:16:39.040
 language is that what the language is talking about is things that exist in the world or things

2:16:39.040 --> 2:16:47.280
 that we can imagine and construct. It's aimed to be an abstract language from the beginning.

2:16:47.280 --> 2:16:52.320
 And so for example, one feature it has is that it's a symbolic language, which means that the

2:16:52.320 --> 2:16:58.720
 thing called, you have an X, just type in X, and Wolfram language will just say, oh, that's X.

2:16:58.720 --> 2:17:05.520
 It won't say error, undefined thing. I don't know what it is, computation, in terms of computing.

2:17:05.520 --> 2:17:12.880
 Now that X could perfectly well be the city of Boston. That's a thing. That's a symbolic thing.

2:17:12.880 --> 2:17:19.280
 Or it could perfectly well be the trajectory of some spacecraft represented as a symbolic thing.

2:17:20.480 --> 2:17:26.720
 And that idea that one can work with, sort of computationally work with these different,

2:17:26.720 --> 2:17:32.400
 these kinds of things that exist in the world or describe the world, that's really powerful.

2:17:32.400 --> 2:17:40.240
 And when I started designing, well, when I designed the predecessor of what's now Wolfram

2:17:40.240 --> 2:17:46.960
 language, which is a thing called SMP, which was my first computer language, I kind of wanted to

2:17:46.960 --> 2:17:52.240
 have this sort of infrastructure for computation, which was as fundamental as possible. I mean,

2:17:52.240 --> 2:17:57.920
 this is what I got for having been a physicist and tried to find fundamental components of things

2:17:57.920 --> 2:18:03.920
 and wound up with this kind of idea of transformation rules for symbolic expressions

2:18:03.920 --> 2:18:08.800
 as being sort of the underlying stuff from which computation would be built.

2:18:09.680 --> 2:18:16.640
 And that's what we've been building from in Wolfram language. And operationally, what happens,

2:18:16.640 --> 2:18:23.920
 it's, I would say, by far the highest level computer language that exists. And it's really

2:18:23.920 --> 2:18:29.440
 been built in a very different direction from other languages. So other languages have been

2:18:29.440 --> 2:18:34.400
 about, there is a core language. It really is kind of wrapped around the operations that a

2:18:34.400 --> 2:18:40.320
 computer intrinsically does. Maybe people add libraries for this or that, but the goal of

2:18:40.320 --> 2:18:46.240
 Wolfram language is to have the language itself be able to cover this sort of very broad range

2:18:46.240 --> 2:18:51.600
 of things that show up in the world. And that means that there are 6,000 primitive functions

2:18:51.600 --> 2:18:57.680
 in the Wolfram language that cover things. I could probably pick a random here. I'm going to pick

2:18:57.680 --> 2:19:07.360
 just for fun, I'll pick, let's take a random sample of all the things that we have here.

2:19:07.360 --> 2:19:10.800
 So let's just say random sample of 10 of them and let's see what we get.

2:19:10.800 --> 2:19:18.160
 Wow. Okay. So these are really different things from functions. These are all functions,

2:19:18.160 --> 2:19:23.920
 Boolean convert. Okay. That's the thing for converting between different types of Boolean

2:19:23.920 --> 2:19:29.120
 expressions. So for people are just listening, uh, Stephen typed in random sample of names,

2:19:29.120 --> 2:19:34.320
 so this is sampling from all function. How many you said there might be 6,000 from 6,000 10 of

2:19:34.320 --> 2:19:40.240
 them. And there's a hilarious variety of them. Yeah, right. Well, we've got things about, um,

2:19:40.240 --> 2:19:46.000
 dollar requester address that has to do with interacting with, uh, uh, the, the world of the,

2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:52.880
 of the cloud and so on. Discrete wavelet data, spheroidal, graphical sort of window. Yeah. Yeah.

2:19:52.880 --> 2:19:56.880
 Window movable. That's the user interface kind of thing. I want to pick another 10 cause I think

2:19:56.880 --> 2:20:01.840
 this is some, okay. So yeah, there's a lot of infrastructure stuff here that you see. If you,

2:20:01.840 --> 2:20:05.440
 if you just start sampling at random, there's a lot of kind of infrastructural things. If you're

2:20:05.440 --> 2:20:09.360
 more, you know, if you more look at the, um, some of the exciting machine learning stuff you showed

2:20:09.360 --> 2:20:14.560
 off, is that also in this pool? Oh yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, so one of those functions is

2:20:14.560 --> 2:20:19.280
 like image identify as a, as a function here where you just say image identify. I don't know. It's

2:20:19.280 --> 2:20:25.760
 always good to, let's do this. Let's say current image and let's pick up an image, hopefully.

2:20:26.880 --> 2:20:31.120
 Current image accessing the webcam, took a picture yourself.

2:20:31.120 --> 2:20:37.360
 Took a terrible picture. But anyway, we can say image identify, open square brackets, and then

2:20:37.360 --> 2:20:41.840
 we just paste that picture in there. Image identify function running on the picture.

2:20:41.840 --> 2:20:46.240
 Oh, and it says, Oh wow. It says I, it looked, I looked like a plunger because I got this great

2:20:46.240 --> 2:20:51.040
 big thing behind my classifies. So this image identify classifies the most likely object in,

2:20:51.040 --> 2:20:56.800
 in the image. So, so plunger. Okay. That's, that's a bit embarrassing. Let's see what it does.

2:20:56.800 --> 2:21:02.160
 And let's pick the top 10. Um, okay. Well, it thinks there's a, Oh, it thinks it's pretty

2:21:02.160 --> 2:21:08.960
 unlikely that it's a primate, a hominid, a person. 8% probability. 57 is a plunger.

2:21:08.960 --> 2:21:12.960
 Yeah. Well, hopefully we'll not give you an existential crisis. And then, uh,

2:21:12.960 --> 2:21:20.320
 8%, uh, I shouldn't say percent, but, uh, no, that's right. 8% that it's a hominid. Um, and,

2:21:20.320 --> 2:21:24.560
 uh, yeah. Okay. It's really, I'm going to do another one of these just cause I'm embarrassed

2:21:24.560 --> 2:21:30.560
 that it, um, I didn't see me at all. There we go. Let's try that. Let's see what that did.

2:21:30.560 --> 2:21:38.240
 Um, we took a picture with a little bit more of me and not just my bald head, so to speak.

2:21:38.240 --> 2:21:44.160
 Okay. 89% probability it's a person. So that, so then I would, um, but, uh, you know, so this is

2:21:44.160 --> 2:21:49.680
 image identify as an example of one of just one of them, just one function out of that part of the

2:21:50.240 --> 2:21:55.920
 that's like part of the language. Yes. And I mean, you know, something like, um, I could say,

2:21:55.920 --> 2:22:02.480
 I don't know, let's find the geo nearest, uh, what could we find? Um, let's find the nearest volcano.

2:22:03.040 --> 2:22:11.920
 Um, let's find the 10. I wonder where it thinks here is. Let's try finding the 10 volcanoes

2:22:11.920 --> 2:22:19.280
 nearest here. Okay. So geo nearest volcano here, 10 nearest volcanoes. Right. Let's find out where

2:22:19.280 --> 2:22:24.320
 those are. We can now, we've got a list of volcanoes out and I can say geo list plot that

2:22:24.320 --> 2:22:30.080
 and hopefully, okay, so there we go. So there's a map that shows the positions of those 10 volcanoes

2:22:30.080 --> 2:22:35.040
 of the East coast and the Midwest and well, no, we're okay. We're okay. There's not, it's not too

2:22:35.040 --> 2:22:39.280
 bad. Yeah. They're not very close to us. We could, we could measure how far away they are, but, um,

2:22:39.280 --> 2:22:44.560
 you know, the fact that right in the language, it knows about all the volcanoes in the world. It

2:22:44.560 --> 2:22:49.200
 knows, you know, computing what the nearest ones are. It knows all the maps of the world and so on.

2:22:49.200 --> 2:22:54.320
 It's a fundamentally different idea of what a language is. Yeah, right. That's why I like to

2:22:54.320 --> 2:22:57.520
 talk about is that, you know, a full scale computational language. That's, that's what

2:22:57.520 --> 2:23:01.360
 we've tried to do. And just if you can comment briefly, I mean, this kind of,

2:23:02.480 --> 2:23:07.360
 the Wolfram language along with Wolfram Alpha represents kind of what the dream of what AI is

2:23:07.360 --> 2:23:14.320
 supposed to be. There's now a sort of a craze of learning kind of idea that we can take raw data

2:23:14.320 --> 2:23:20.320
 and from that extract the, uh, the different hierarchies of abstractions in order to be able

2:23:20.320 --> 2:23:27.360
 to under, like in order to form the kind of things that Wolfram language operates with,

2:23:27.360 --> 2:23:30.800
 but we're very far from learning systems being able to form that.

2:23:32.400 --> 2:23:39.280
 Like the context of history of AI, if you could just comment on, there is a, you said computation

2:23:39.280 --> 2:23:44.560
 X and there's just some sense where in the eighties and nineties sort of expert systems

2:23:44.560 --> 2:23:49.600
 represented a very particular computation X. Yes. Right. And there's a kind of notion that

2:23:50.320 --> 2:23:57.520
 those efforts didn't pan out. Right. But then out of that emerges kind of Wolfram language,

2:23:57.520 --> 2:24:02.240
 Wolfram Alpha, which is the success. I mean, yeah, right. I think those are in some sense,

2:24:02.240 --> 2:24:06.800
 those efforts were too modest. That is they were, they were looking at particular areas

2:24:06.800 --> 2:24:10.560
 and you actually can't do it with a particular area. I mean, like, like even a problem like

2:24:10.560 --> 2:24:15.040
 natural language understanding, it's critical to have broad knowledge of the world. If you want to

2:24:15.040 --> 2:24:20.000
 do good natural language understanding and you kind of have to bite off the whole problem. If you,

2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:24.720
 if you say, we're just going to do the blocks world over here, so to speak, you don't really,

2:24:24.720 --> 2:24:28.960
 it's, it's, it's actually, it's one of these cases where it's easier to do the whole thing than it

2:24:28.960 --> 2:24:32.640
 is to do some piece of it. You know, what, one comment to make about sort of the relationship

2:24:32.640 --> 2:24:39.120
 between what we've tried to do and sort of the learning side of, of AI. You know, in a sense,

2:24:39.120 --> 2:24:43.520
 if you look at the development of knowledge in our civilization as a whole, there was kind of this

2:24:43.520 --> 2:24:48.320
 notion pre 300 years ago or so. Now you want to figure something out about the world. You can

2:24:48.320 --> 2:24:54.480
 reason it out. You can do things which are just use raw human thought. And then along came sort

2:24:54.480 --> 2:25:01.360
 of modern mathematical science. And we found ways to just sort of blast through that by in that case,

2:25:01.360 --> 2:25:05.920
 in that case, writing down equations. Now we also know we can do that with computation and so on.

2:25:06.880 --> 2:25:12.480
 And so that was kind of a different thing. So, so when we look at how do we sort of encode

2:25:12.480 --> 2:25:17.760
 knowledge and figure things out, one way we could do it is start from scratch, learn everything.

2:25:17.760 --> 2:25:24.000
 It's just a neural net figuring everything out. But in a sense that denies the sort of knowledge

2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:29.360
 based achievements of our civilization, because in our civilization, we have learned lots of stuff.

2:25:29.360 --> 2:25:33.440
 We've surveyed all the volcanoes in the world. We've done, you know, we figured out lots of

2:25:33.440 --> 2:25:39.120
 algorithms for this or that. Those are things that we can encode computationally. And that's what

2:25:39.120 --> 2:25:44.320
 we've tried to do. And we're not saying just, you don't have to start everything from scratch.

2:25:44.320 --> 2:25:50.080
 So in a sense, a big part of what we've done is to try and sort of capture the knowledge of the

2:25:50.080 --> 2:25:57.040
 world in computational form and computable form. Now there's also some pieces which, which were

2:25:57.040 --> 2:26:02.240
 for a long time, undoable by computers like image identification, where there's a really,

2:26:02.240 --> 2:26:07.600
 really useful module that we can add that is those things which actually were pretty easy

2:26:07.600 --> 2:26:12.080
 for humans to do that had been hard for computers to do. I think the thing that's interesting,

2:26:12.080 --> 2:26:16.240
 that's emerging now is the interplay between these things, between this kind of knowledge of the

2:26:16.240 --> 2:26:23.200
 world that is in a sense, very symbolic and this kind of sort of much more statistical kind of

2:26:23.200 --> 2:26:28.880
 things like image identification and so on. And putting those together by having this sort of

2:26:28.880 --> 2:26:34.560
 symbolic representation of image identification, that that's where things get really interesting

2:26:34.560 --> 2:26:40.000
 and where you can kind of symbolically represent patterns of things and images and so on. I think

2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:43.920
 that's, you know, that's kind of a part of the path forward, so to speak.

2:26:43.920 --> 2:26:50.240
 Yeah. So the dream of, so the machine learning is not in my view, I think the view of many people

2:26:50.240 --> 2:26:57.360
 is not anywhere close to building the kind of wide world of computable knowledge that will from

2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:04.640
 language of build. But because you have a kind of, you've done the incredibly hard work of building

2:27:04.640 --> 2:27:11.360
 this world, now machine learning can be, can serve as tools to help you explore that world.

2:27:11.360 --> 2:27:11.680
 Yeah, yeah.

2:27:11.680 --> 2:27:16.240
 And that's what you've added. I mean, with the version 12, right? You added a few,

2:27:16.240 --> 2:27:20.160
 I was seeing some demos, it looks amazing.

2:27:20.160 --> 2:27:24.160
 Right. I mean, I think, you know, this, it's sort of interesting to see the,

2:27:25.840 --> 2:27:30.560
 the sort of the, once it's computable, once it's in there, it's running in sort of a very efficient

2:27:30.560 --> 2:27:34.800
 computational way. But then there's sort of things like the interface of how do you get there? You

2:27:34.800 --> 2:27:38.560
 know, how do you do natural language understanding to get there? How do you, how do you pick out

2:27:38.560 --> 2:27:44.400
 entities in a big piece of text or something? That's I mean, actually a good example right now

2:27:44.400 --> 2:27:51.040
 is our NLP NLU loop, which is we've done a lot of stuff, natural language understanding using

2:27:51.040 --> 2:27:56.800
 essentially not learning based methods, using a lot of, you know, little algorithmic methods,

2:27:56.800 --> 2:27:58.320
 human curation methods and so on.

2:27:58.320 --> 2:28:04.000
 In terms of when people try to enter a query and then converting. So the process of converting

2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:11.840
 NLU defined beautifully as converting their query into a computational language,

2:28:11.840 --> 2:28:17.360
 which is a very well, first of all, super practical definition, very useful definition,

2:28:17.360 --> 2:28:21.840
 and then also a very clear definition of natural language understanding.

2:28:21.840 --> 2:28:25.520
 Right. I mean, a different thing is natural language processing, where it's like,

2:28:25.520 --> 2:28:30.320
 here's a big lump of text, go pick out all the cities in that text, for example.

2:28:30.320 --> 2:28:35.280
 And so a good example of, you know, so we do that, we're using, using modern machine learning

2:28:35.280 --> 2:28:40.480
 techniques. And it's actually kind of, kind of an interesting process that's going on right now.

2:28:40.480 --> 2:28:46.800
 It's this loop between what do we pick up with NLP using machine learning versus what do we pick up

2:28:46.800 --> 2:28:51.840
 with our more kind of precise computational methods in natural language understanding.

2:28:51.840 --> 2:28:55.440
 And so we've got this kind of loop going between those, which is improving both of them.

2:28:55.440 --> 2:28:57.600
 Yeah. And I think you have some of the state of the art transformers,

2:28:57.600 --> 2:28:58.960
 like you have BERT in there, I think.

2:28:58.960 --> 2:28:59.600
 Oh yeah.

2:28:59.600 --> 2:29:02.800
 So it's closely, you have, you have integrating all the models. I mean,

2:29:02.800 --> 2:29:07.440
 this is the hybrid thing that people have always dreamed about or talking about.

2:29:07.440 --> 2:29:15.280
 I'm actually just surprised, frankly, that Wolfram language is not more popular than it already is.

2:29:15.280 --> 2:29:24.640
 You know, that's a, it's a, it's a complicated issue because it's like, it involves, you know,

2:29:24.640 --> 2:29:30.000
 it involves ideas and ideas are absorbed slowly in the world. I mean, I think that's

2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:34.560
 And then there's sort of like what we're talking about, there's egos and personalities and some of

2:29:34.560 --> 2:29:42.320
 the, the absorption, absorption mechanisms of ideas have to do with personalities and the students of

2:29:42.320 --> 2:29:47.360
 personalities and the, and then a little social network. So it's, it's interesting how the spread

2:29:47.360 --> 2:29:48.320
 of ideas works.

2:29:48.320 --> 2:29:54.400
 You know, what's funny with Wolfram language is that we are, if you say, you know, what market

2:29:54.400 --> 2:30:00.880
 sort of market penetration, if you look at the, I would say very high end of R&D and sort of the,

2:30:00.880 --> 2:30:06.640
 the people where you say, wow, that's a really impressive, smart person. They're very often

2:30:06.640 --> 2:30:12.240
 users of Wolfram language, very, very often. If you look at the more sort of, it's a funny thing.

2:30:12.240 --> 2:30:16.800
 If you look at the more kind of, I would say people who are like, oh, we're just plodding

2:30:16.800 --> 2:30:22.960
 away doing what we do. They're often not yet Wolfram language users. And that dynamic,

2:30:22.960 --> 2:30:27.360
 it's kind of odd that there hasn't been more rapid trickle down because we really, you know,

2:30:27.360 --> 2:30:33.600
 the high end we've really been very successful in for a long time. And it's, it's, but with,

2:30:33.600 --> 2:30:40.880
 you know, that's partly, I think, a consequence of my fault in a sense, because it's kind of,

2:30:40.880 --> 2:30:47.120
 you know, I have a company which is really emphasizes sort of creating products and

2:30:48.480 --> 2:30:55.920
 building a sort of the best possible technical tower we can rather than sort of doing the

2:30:55.920 --> 2:30:59.840
 commercial side of things and pumping it out in sort of the most effective way.

2:30:59.840 --> 2:31:03.360
 And there's an interesting idea that, you know, perhaps you can make it more popular

2:31:03.360 --> 2:31:09.200
 by opening everything up, sort of the GitHub model. But there's an interesting,

2:31:09.200 --> 2:31:14.080
 I think I've heard you discuss this, that that turns out not to work in a lot of cases,

2:31:14.080 --> 2:31:20.880
 like in this particular case, that you want it, that when you deeply care about the integrity,

2:31:20.880 --> 2:31:27.280
 the quality of the knowledge that you're building, that, unfortunately, you can't,

2:31:27.840 --> 2:31:29.520
 you can't distribute that effort.

2:31:29.520 --> 2:31:35.760
 Yeah, it's not the nature of how things work. I mean, you know, what we're trying to do

2:31:35.760 --> 2:31:41.440
 is a thing that for better or worse, requires leadership. And it requires kind of maintaining

2:31:41.440 --> 2:31:48.640
 a coherent vision over a long period of time, and doing not only the cool vision related work,

2:31:48.640 --> 2:31:53.840
 but also the kind of mundane in the trenches make the thing actually work well, work.

2:31:53.840 --> 2:31:59.120
 So how do you build the knowledge? Because that's the fascinating thing. That's the mundane,

2:31:59.120 --> 2:32:04.080
 the fascinating and the mundane is building the knowledge, the adding, integrating more data.

2:32:04.080 --> 2:32:08.560
 Yeah, I mean, that's probably not the most, I mean, the things like get it to work in all

2:32:08.560 --> 2:32:13.200
 these different cloud environments and so on. That's pretty, you know, it's very practical

2:32:13.200 --> 2:32:17.680
 stuff, you know, have the user interface be smooth and, you know, have there be take only

2:32:17.680 --> 2:32:24.880
 a fraction of a millisecond to do this or that. That's a lot of work. And it's, it's, but, you

2:32:24.880 --> 2:32:30.400
 know, I think my, it's an interesting thing over the period of time, you know, often language has

2:32:30.400 --> 2:32:35.840
 existed, basically, for more than half of the total amount of time that any language, any computer

2:32:35.840 --> 2:32:41.760
 language has existed. That is, computer language is maybe 60 years old, you know, give or take,

2:32:41.760 --> 2:32:48.880
 and often language is 33 years old. So it's, it's kind of a, and I think I was realizing recently,

2:32:48.880 --> 2:32:54.400
 there's been more innovation in the distribution of software than probably than in the structure

2:32:54.400 --> 2:33:00.800
 of programming languages over that period of time. And we, you know, we've been sort of trying to do

2:33:00.800 --> 2:33:05.520
 our best to adapt to it. And the good news is that we have, you know, because I have a simple

2:33:05.520 --> 2:33:09.840
 private company and so on that doesn't have, you know, a bunch of investors, you know,

2:33:09.840 --> 2:33:14.160
 telling us we've got to do this so that they have lots of freedom in what we can do. And so,

2:33:14.160 --> 2:33:18.880
 for example, we're able to, oh, I don't know, we have this free Wolfram engine for developers,

2:33:18.880 --> 2:33:24.160
 which is a free version for developers. And we've been, you know, we've, there are site licenses for,

2:33:24.160 --> 2:33:30.080
 for Mathematica and Wolfram language at basically all major universities, certainly in the US by now.

2:33:30.080 --> 2:33:35.920
 So it's effectively free to people and all universities in effect. And, you know, we've been

2:33:35.920 --> 2:33:41.600
 doing a progression of things. I mean, different things like Wolfram Alpha, for example,

2:33:41.600 --> 2:33:48.640
 the main website is just a free website. What is Wolfram Alpha? Okay, Wolfram Alpha is a system for

2:33:48.640 --> 2:33:54.720
 answering questions where you ask a question with natural language, and it'll try and generate a

2:33:54.720 --> 2:33:59.680
 report telling you the answer to that question. So the question could be something like, you know,

2:33:59.680 --> 2:34:06.800
 what's the population of Boston divided by New York compared to New York? And it'll take those

2:34:06.800 --> 2:34:14.320
 words and give you an answer. And that converts the words into computable, into Wolfram language,

2:34:14.320 --> 2:34:19.440
 into Wolfram language and computational language. And then do you think the underlying knowledge

2:34:19.440 --> 2:34:24.880
 belongs to Wolfram Alpha or to the Wolfram language? What's the Wolfram knowledge base?

2:34:24.880 --> 2:34:30.080
 Knowledge base. I mean, it's been a, that's been a big effort over the decades to collect all that

2:34:30.080 --> 2:34:34.960
 stuff. And, you know, more of it flows in every second. So can you, can you just pause on that

2:34:34.960 --> 2:34:40.560
 for a second? Like, that's one of the most incredible things, of course, in the long term,

2:34:40.560 --> 2:34:46.880
 Wolfram language itself is the fundamental thing. But in the amazing sort of short term,

2:34:46.880 --> 2:34:53.760
 the knowledge base is kind of incredible. So what's the process of building that knowledge base? The

2:34:53.760 --> 2:34:57.520
 fact that you, first of all, from the very beginning, that you're brave enough to start to

2:34:57.520 --> 2:35:06.400
 take on the general knowledge base. And how do you go from zero to the incredible knowledge base that

2:35:06.400 --> 2:35:10.880
 you have now? Well, yeah, it was kind of scary at some level. I mean, I had, I had wondered about

2:35:10.880 --> 2:35:14.960
 doing something like this since I was a kid. I mean, I had, I had wondered about doing something

2:35:14.960 --> 2:35:18.800
 like this since I was a kid. So it wasn't like I hadn't thought about it for a while.

2:35:20.800 --> 2:35:26.960
 Most of the brilliant dreamers give up such a difficult engineering notion at some point.

2:35:26.960 --> 2:35:32.880
 Right. Well, the thing that happened with me, which was kind of, it's a, it's a live your own

2:35:32.880 --> 2:35:38.720
 paradigm kind of theory. So basically what happened is I had assumed that to build something like

2:35:38.720 --> 2:35:44.400
 Wolfram Alpha would require sort of solving the general AI problem. That's what I had assumed.

2:35:44.400 --> 2:35:47.840
 And so I kept on thinking about that and I thought, I don't really know how to do that.

2:35:47.840 --> 2:35:53.040
 So I don't do anything. Then I worked on my new kind of science project and sort of exploring

2:35:53.040 --> 2:35:57.680
 the computational universe and came up with things like this principle of computational equivalence,

2:35:57.680 --> 2:36:02.800
 which say there is no bright line between the intelligent and the merely computational.

2:36:02.800 --> 2:36:07.520
 So I thought, look, that's this paradigm I've built. You know, now it's, you know,

2:36:07.520 --> 2:36:11.680
 now I have to eat that dog food myself, so to speak. You know, I've been thinking about doing

2:36:11.680 --> 2:36:16.880
 this thing with computable knowledge forever and, you know, let me actually try and do it.

2:36:16.880 --> 2:36:21.920
 And so it was, you know, if my paradigm is right, then this should be possible.

2:36:21.920 --> 2:36:25.600
 But the beginning was certainly, you know, it was a bit daunting. I remember I took the

2:36:26.960 --> 2:36:31.120
 early team to a big reference library and we're like looking at this reference library and it's

2:36:31.120 --> 2:36:36.640
 like, you know, my basic statement is our goal over the next year or two is to ingest everything

2:36:36.640 --> 2:36:43.360
 that's in here. And that's, you know, it seemed very daunting, but in a sense, I was well aware

2:36:43.360 --> 2:36:46.720
 of the fact that it's finite. You know, the fact that you can walk into the reference library,

2:36:46.720 --> 2:36:51.440
 it's a big, big thing with lots of reference books all over the place, but it is finite.

2:36:51.440 --> 2:36:56.640
 You know, this is not an infinite, you know, it's not the infinite corridor of, so to speak,

2:36:56.640 --> 2:37:02.480
 of reference library. It's not truly infinite, so to speak. But no, I mean, and then what happened

2:37:02.480 --> 2:37:08.800
 was sort of interesting there was from a methodology point of view was I didn't start off

2:37:08.800 --> 2:37:14.560
 saying let me have a grand theory for how all this knowledge works. It was like, let's, you know,

2:37:14.560 --> 2:37:19.520
 implement this area, this area, this area, a few hundred areas and so on. That's a lot of work.

2:37:20.320 --> 2:37:30.080
 I also found that, you know, I've been fortunate in that our products get used by sort of the

2:37:30.080 --> 2:37:34.800
 world's experts in lots of areas. And so that really helped because we were able to ask people,

2:37:34.800 --> 2:37:40.240
 you know, the world expert in this or that, and we're able to ask them for input and so on. And

2:37:40.240 --> 2:37:46.640
 I found that my general principle was that any area where there wasn't some expert who helped

2:37:46.640 --> 2:37:51.760
 us figure out what to do wouldn't be right. You know, because our goal was to kind of get to the

2:37:51.760 --> 2:37:57.360
 point where we had sort of true expert level knowledge about everything. And so that, you know,

2:37:57.360 --> 2:38:02.320
 the ultimate goal is if there's a question that can be answered on the basis of general knowledge

2:38:02.320 --> 2:38:07.360
 in our civilization, make it be automatic to be able to answer that question. And, you know, and

2:38:07.360 --> 2:38:13.520
 now, well, Wolfman got used in Siri from the very beginning, and it's now also used in Alexa.

2:38:13.520 --> 2:38:18.320
 And so it's people are kind of getting more of the, you know, they get more of the sense of

2:38:19.120 --> 2:38:24.240
 this is what should be possible to do. I mean, in a sense, the question answering problem

2:38:24.240 --> 2:38:29.680
 was viewed as one of the sort of core AI problems for a long time. And I had kind of an interesting

2:38:29.680 --> 2:38:36.640
 experience. I had a friend, Marvin Minsky, who was a well known AI person from right around here.

2:38:37.440 --> 2:38:42.720
 And I remember when Wolfman Alpha was coming out, it was a few weeks before it came out, I think,

2:38:43.280 --> 2:38:47.840
 I happened to see Marvin. And I said, I should show you this thing we have, you know, it's a

2:38:47.840 --> 2:38:54.320
 you know, it's a question answering system. And he was like, okay, type something. And it's like, okay,

2:38:54.320 --> 2:38:58.400
 fine. And then he's talking about something different. I said, no, Marvin, you know,

2:38:58.400 --> 2:39:03.520
 this time, it actually works. You know, look at this, it actually works. He's typed in a few more

2:39:03.520 --> 2:39:07.840
 things. There's maybe 10 more things. Of course, we have a record of what he typed in, which is

2:39:07.840 --> 2:39:08.880
 kind of interesting. But

2:39:11.440 --> 2:39:16.640
 and then you can you share where his mind was in the testing space? Like what,

2:39:16.640 --> 2:39:20.960
 all kinds of random things? He was trying random stuff, you know, medical stuff, and,

2:39:20.960 --> 2:39:26.080
 you know, chemistry stuff, and, you know, astronomy and so on. And it was like, like, you know,

2:39:26.080 --> 2:39:33.440
 after a few minutes, he was like, Oh, my God, it actually works. And the but that was kind of told

2:39:33.440 --> 2:39:38.560
 you something about the state, you know, what, what happened in AI, because people had, you know,

2:39:38.560 --> 2:39:43.040
 in a sense, by trying to solve the bigger problem, we were able to actually make something that would

2:39:43.040 --> 2:39:48.240
 work. Now, to be fair, you know, we had a bunch of completely unfair advantages. For example,

2:39:48.240 --> 2:39:53.120
 we already built a bunch of awesome language, which was, you know, very high level symbolic

2:39:53.120 --> 2:40:01.120
 language. We had, you know, I had the practical experience of building big systems. I have the

2:40:01.120 --> 2:40:07.120
 sort of intellectual confidence to not just sort of give up and doing something like this. I think

2:40:07.120 --> 2:40:13.360
 that the, you know, it is a, it's always a funny thing, you know, I've worked on a bunch of big

2:40:13.360 --> 2:40:19.920
 projects in my life. And I would say that the, you know, you mentioned ego, I would also mention

2:40:19.920 --> 2:40:25.920
 optimism, so to speak. I mean, in, you know, if somebody said, this project is going to take 30

2:40:25.920 --> 2:40:34.720
 years, it's, you know, it would be hard to sell me on that. You know, I'm always in the in the

2:40:34.720 --> 2:40:39.680
 well, I can kind of see a few years, you know, something's going to happen in a few years. And

2:40:39.680 --> 2:40:45.040
 usually it does, something happens in a few years, but the whole, the tail can be decades long. And

2:40:45.040 --> 2:40:50.000
 that's, you know, and from a personal point of view, always the challenge is you end up with

2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:56.000
 these projects that have infinite tails. And the question is, do the tails kind of, do you just

2:40:56.000 --> 2:41:03.360
 drown in kind of dealing with all of the tails of these projects? And that's an interesting sort of

2:41:03.360 --> 2:41:08.240
 personal challenge. And like my efforts now to work on fundamental theory of physics, which I've

2:41:08.240 --> 2:41:14.560
 just started doing, and I'm having a lot of fun with it. But it's kind of, you know, it's, it's

2:41:14.560 --> 2:41:21.120
 kind of making a bet that I can, I can kind of, you know, I can do that as well as doing the

2:41:21.120 --> 2:41:26.080
 incredibly energetic things that I'm trying to do with Orphan Language and so on. I mean, the

2:41:26.080 --> 2:41:31.520
 vision. Yeah. And underlying that, I mean, I've just talked for the second time with Elon Musk,

2:41:31.520 --> 2:41:38.480
 and that you, you two share that quality a little bit of that optimism of taking on basically the

2:41:38.480 --> 2:41:47.120
 daunting, what most people call impossible. And he, and you take it on out of, you can call it ego,

2:41:47.120 --> 2:41:51.760
 you can call it naivety, you can call it optimism, whatever the heck it is, but that's how you solve

2:41:51.760 --> 2:41:56.880
 the impossible things. Yeah. I mean, look at what happens. And I don't know, you know, in my own

2:41:56.880 --> 2:42:03.600
 case, I, you know, it's been, I progressively got a bit more confident and progressively able to,

2:42:03.600 --> 2:42:07.440
 you know, decide that these projects aren't crazy. But then the other thing is the other,

2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:13.680
 the other trap that one can end up with is, Oh, I've done these projects and they're big.

2:42:13.680 --> 2:42:18.880
 Let me never do a project that's any smaller than any project I've done so far. And that's,

2:42:18.880 --> 2:42:25.440
 you know, and that can be a trap. And often these projects are of completely unknown, you know,

2:42:25.440 --> 2:42:29.360
 that their depth and significance is actually very hard to know.

2:42:31.120 --> 2:42:37.760
 On the sort of building this giant knowledge base that's behind Wolfram language, Wolfram Alpha,

2:42:40.000 --> 2:42:46.480
 what do you think about the internet? What do you think about, for example, Wikipedia,

2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:53.360
 these large aggregations of texts that's not converted into computable knowledge?

2:42:53.360 --> 2:42:59.920
 Do you think if you look at Wolfram language, Wolfram Alpha, 20, 30, maybe 50 years down the

2:42:59.920 --> 2:43:08.880
 line, do you hope to store all of the sort of Google's dream is to make all information searchable,

2:43:09.440 --> 2:43:16.160
 accessible, but that's really as defined, it's, it's a, it doesn't include the understanding

2:43:16.160 --> 2:43:25.440
 of information. Right. Do you hope to make all of knowledge represented within? I hope so.

2:43:25.440 --> 2:43:29.120
 That's what we're trying to do. How hard is that problem? Like closing that gap?

2:43:30.320 --> 2:43:34.880
 It depends on the use cases. I mean, so if it's a question of answering general knowledge questions

2:43:34.880 --> 2:43:40.480
 about the world, we're in pretty good shape on that right now. If it's a question of representing,

2:43:40.480 --> 2:43:46.720
 uh, like an area that we're going into right now is computational contracts, being able to

2:43:47.280 --> 2:43:52.080
 take something which would be written in legalese, it might even be the specifications for, you know,

2:43:52.080 --> 2:43:56.000
 what should the self driving car do when it encounters this or that or the other? What should

2:43:56.000 --> 2:44:02.880
 the, you know, whatever the, you know, write that in a computational language and be able to express

2:44:02.880 --> 2:44:08.960
 things about the world. You know, if the creature that you see running across the road is a, you

2:44:08.960 --> 2:44:15.120
 know, thing at this point in the evil tree of life, then swerve this way, otherwise don't those

2:44:15.120 --> 2:44:20.000
 kinds of things. Are there ethical components? When you start to get to some of the messy human

2:44:20.000 --> 2:44:26.160
 things, are those encodable into computable knowledge? Well, I think that it is a necessary

2:44:26.160 --> 2:44:32.080
 feature of attempting to automate more in the world that we encode more and more of ethics

2:44:32.720 --> 2:44:38.240
 in a way that, uh, gets sort of quickly, you know, is, is able to be dealt with by, by computer. I

2:44:38.240 --> 2:44:43.280
 mean, I've been involved recently. I sort of got backed into being involved in the question of,

2:44:43.280 --> 2:44:49.120
 uh, automated content selection on the internet. So, you know, the Facebooks, Googles,

2:44:49.120 --> 2:44:54.640
 Twitters, you know, what, how do they rank the stuff they feed to us humans, so to speak? Um,

2:44:54.640 --> 2:44:59.120
 and the question of what are, you know, what should never be fed to us? What should be blocked

2:44:59.120 --> 2:45:04.080
 forever? What should be upranked, you know, and what is the, what are the kind of principles behind

2:45:04.080 --> 2:45:09.040
 that? And what I kind of, well, a bunch of different things I realized about that. But

2:45:09.040 --> 2:45:15.120
 one thing that's interesting is being able, you know, in effect, you're building sort of an AI

2:45:15.120 --> 2:45:21.120
 ethics. You have to build an AI ethics module in effect to decide, is this thing so shocking? I'm

2:45:21.120 --> 2:45:26.960
 never going to show it to people. Is this thing so whatever? And I did realize in thinking about

2:45:26.960 --> 2:45:32.160
 that, that, you know, there's not going to be one of these things. It's not possible to decide, or

2:45:32.160 --> 2:45:36.800
 it might be possible, but it would be really bad for the future of our species if we just decided

2:45:36.800 --> 2:45:43.600
 there's this one AI ethics module and it's going to determine the practices of everything in the

2:45:43.600 --> 2:45:48.400
 world, so to speak. And I kind of realized one has to sort of break it up. And that's an interesting

2:45:48.400 --> 2:45:54.800
 societal problem of how one does that and how one sort of has people sort of self identify for,

2:45:54.800 --> 2:45:58.880
 you know, I'm buying in, in the case of just content selection, it's sort of easier because

2:45:58.880 --> 2:46:04.320
 it's like an individual, it's for an individual. It's not something that kind of cuts across sort

2:46:04.320 --> 2:46:12.400
 of societal boundaries. But it's a really interesting notion of, I heard you describe,

2:46:12.400 --> 2:46:19.280
 I really like it sort of maybe in sort of have different AI systems that have a certain kind

2:46:19.280 --> 2:46:24.960
 of brand that they represent essentially. You could have like, I don't know, whether it's

2:46:24.960 --> 2:46:33.280
 conservative or liberal and then libertarian. And there's an Randian, objectivist AI system and

2:46:33.280 --> 2:46:38.400
 different ethical and, I mean, it's almost encoding some of the ideologies which we've

2:46:38.400 --> 2:46:43.520
 been struggling. I come from the Soviet Union. That didn't work out so well with the ideologies

2:46:43.520 --> 2:46:49.920
 that worked out there. And so you have, but they all, everybody purchased that particular ethics

2:46:49.920 --> 2:46:57.200
 system and the, and in the same, I suppose could be done encoded that that system could be encoded

2:46:57.200 --> 2:47:04.080
 into computational knowledge and allow us to explore in the realm of, in the digital space.

2:47:04.080 --> 2:47:09.520
 That's a really exciting possibility. Are you playing with those ideas in Wolfram Language?

2:47:10.080 --> 2:47:15.920
 Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the, you know, that's, Wolfram Language has sort of the best opportunity to kind

2:47:15.920 --> 2:47:20.000
 of express those essentially computational contracts about what to do. Now there's a bunch

2:47:20.000 --> 2:47:26.400
 more work to be done to do it in practice for, you know, deciding the, is this a credible news story?

2:47:26.400 --> 2:47:32.240
 What does that mean or whatever else you're going to pick? I think that that's, you know, that's

2:47:33.680 --> 2:47:40.800
 the question of exactly what we get to do with that is, you know, for me, it's kind of a complicated

2:47:40.800 --> 2:47:45.440
 thing because there are these big projects that I think about, like, you know, find the fundamental

2:47:45.440 --> 2:47:50.720
 theory of physics. Okay. That's box number one, right? Box number two, you know, solve the AI

2:47:50.720 --> 2:47:55.760
 ethics problem in the case of, you know, figure out how you rank all content, so to speak, and

2:47:55.760 --> 2:47:59.920
 decide what people see. That's, that's kind of a box number two, so to speak. These are big

2:47:59.920 --> 2:48:05.040
 projects. And, and I think what do you think is more important, the fundamental nature of reality

2:48:05.040 --> 2:48:10.480
 or, depends who you ask. It's one of these things that's exactly like, you know, what's the ranking,

2:48:10.480 --> 2:48:15.520
 right? It's the, it's the ranking system. It's like, who's, whose module do you use to rank that?

2:48:15.520 --> 2:48:21.840
 If you, and I think, but having multiple modules is a really compelling notion to us humans

2:48:21.840 --> 2:48:27.440
 that in a world where there's not clear that there's a right answer, perhaps you have systems

2:48:28.560 --> 2:48:37.040
 that operate under different, how would you say it? I mean, it's different value systems,

2:48:37.040 --> 2:48:43.040
 different value systems. I mean, I think, you know, in a sense, the, I mean, I'm not really a

2:48:43.040 --> 2:48:47.840
 politics oriented person, but, but, you know, in the kind of totalitarianism, it's kind of like,

2:48:47.840 --> 2:48:53.600
 you're going to have this, this system and that's the way it is. I mean, kind of the, you know,

2:48:53.600 --> 2:48:59.360
 the concept of sort of a market based system where you have, okay, I, as a human, I'm going to pick

2:48:59.360 --> 2:49:04.640
 this system. I, as another human, I'm going to pick this system. I mean, that's in a sense,

2:49:04.640 --> 2:49:11.520
 this case of automated content selection is a non trivial, but it is probably the easiest

2:49:11.520 --> 2:49:16.160
 of the AI ethics situations because it is each person gets to pick for themselves and there's

2:49:16.160 --> 2:49:21.840
 not a huge interplay between what different people pick by the time you're dealing with

2:49:21.840 --> 2:49:27.280
 other societal things like, you know, what should the policy of the central bank be or something

2:49:27.280 --> 2:49:30.560
 or healthcare system or some of all those kinds of centralized kind of things.

2:49:30.560 --> 2:49:35.200
 Right. Well, I mean, how healthcare again has the feature that, that at some level, each person can

2:49:35.200 --> 2:49:39.680
 pick for themselves, so to speak. I mean, whereas there are other things where there's a necessary

2:49:39.680 --> 2:49:45.040
 public health, there's one example where that's not, where that doesn't get to be, you know,

2:49:45.040 --> 2:49:49.600
 something which people can, what they pick for themselves, they may impose on other people.

2:49:49.600 --> 2:49:53.200
 And then it becomes a more non trivial piece of sort of political philosophy.

2:49:53.200 --> 2:49:56.080
 Of course, the central banking system. So I would argue we would move,

2:49:56.080 --> 2:50:01.200
 we need to move away into digital currency and so on and Bitcoin and ledgers and so on.

2:50:01.200 --> 2:50:05.280
 So yes, there's a lot of, we've been quite involved in that. And that's, that's where

2:50:05.280 --> 2:50:10.960
 that's sort of the motivation for computational contracts in part comes out of, you know, this

2:50:10.960 --> 2:50:15.840
 idea, oh, we can just have this autonomously executing smart contract. The idea of a

2:50:15.840 --> 2:50:22.320
 computational contract is just to say, you know, have something where all of the conditions of

2:50:22.320 --> 2:50:26.880
 the contract are represented in computational form. So in principle, it's automatic to execute

2:50:26.880 --> 2:50:32.880
 the contract. And I think that's, you know, that will surely be the future of, you know,

2:50:32.880 --> 2:50:38.000
 the idea of legal contracts written in English or legalese or whatever. And where people have

2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:46.400
 to argue about what goes on is surely not, you know, we have a much more streamlined process

2:50:46.400 --> 2:50:50.320
 if everything can be represented computationally and the computers can kind of decide what to do.

2:50:50.320 --> 2:50:56.800
 I mean, ironically enough, you know, old Gottfried Leibniz back in the, you know, 1600s was saying

2:50:56.800 --> 2:51:03.200
 exactly the same thing, but he had, you know, his pinnacle of technical achievement was this brass

2:51:03.200 --> 2:51:07.200
 four function mechanical calculator thing that never really worked properly actually.

2:51:08.320 --> 2:51:14.640
 And, you know, so he was like 300 years too early for that idea. But now that idea is pretty

2:51:14.640 --> 2:51:19.280
 realistic, I think. And, you know, you ask how much more difficult is it than what we have now

2:51:19.280 --> 2:51:24.800
 and more from language to express, I call it symbolic discourse language, being able to express

2:51:24.800 --> 2:51:31.120
 sort of everything in the world in kind of computational symbolic form. I think it is

2:51:31.120 --> 2:51:35.040
 absolutely within reach. I mean, I think it's, you know, I don't know, maybe I'm just too much

2:51:35.040 --> 2:51:40.080
 of an optimist, but I think it's a limited number of years to have a pretty well built out version

2:51:40.080 --> 2:51:46.000
 of that, that will allow one to encode the kinds of things that are relevant to typical legal

2:51:46.000 --> 2:51:54.640
 contracts and these kinds of things. The idea of symbolic discourse language, can you try to define

2:51:55.440 --> 2:52:01.680
 the scope of what it is? So we're having a conversation. It's a natural language.

2:52:02.320 --> 2:52:08.640
 Can we have a representation of the sort of actionable parts of that conversation in a

2:52:08.640 --> 2:52:14.000
 precise computable form so that a computer could go do it? And not just contracts, but really sort

2:52:14.000 --> 2:52:20.480
 of some of the things we think of as common sense, essentially, even just like basic notions of human

2:52:20.480 --> 2:52:26.480
 life. Well, I mean, things like, you know, I am, uh, I'm getting hungry and want to eat something.

2:52:26.480 --> 2:52:30.320
 Right. Right. That, that's something we don't have a representation, you know, in more from language

2:52:30.320 --> 2:52:34.320
 right now, if I was like, I'm eating blueberries and raspberries and things like that, and I'm

2:52:34.320 --> 2:52:38.720
 eating this amount of them, we know all about those kinds of fruits and plants and nutrition

2:52:38.720 --> 2:52:43.920
 content and all that kind of thing. But the, I want to eat them part of it is not covered yet.

2:52:44.480 --> 2:52:49.920
 Um, and that, you know, you need to do that in order to have a complete symbolic discourse language

2:52:49.920 --> 2:52:55.040
 to be able to have a natural language conversation. Right. Right. To be able to express the kinds of

2:52:55.040 --> 2:53:00.320
 things that say, you know, if it's a legal contract, it's, you know, the parties desire

2:53:00.320 --> 2:53:04.960
 to have this and that. Um, and that's, you know, that's a thing like, I want to eat a raspberry

2:53:04.960 --> 2:53:11.040
 or something, but that's, isn't that the, isn't this just the only, you said it's centuries old,

2:53:11.040 --> 2:53:19.600
 this dream. Yes. But it's also the more near term, the dream of touring and formulating a touring

2:53:19.600 --> 2:53:32.160
 test. Yes. So do you hope, do you think that's the ultimate test of creating something special?

2:53:32.160 --> 2:53:38.640
 Cause we said, I don't know. I think by special, look, if, if the test is, does it walk and talk

2:53:38.640 --> 2:53:45.440
 like a human? Well, that's just the talking like a human, but, um, uh, the answer is it's an okay

2:53:45.440 --> 2:53:51.440
 test. If you say, is it a test of intelligence? You know, people have attached Wolf Malfoy, the Wolf

2:53:51.440 --> 2:53:57.280
 Malfoy API to, you know, Turing test bots and those bots just lose immediately. Cause all you

2:53:57.280 --> 2:54:02.320
 have to do is ask it five questions that, you know, are about really obscure, weird pieces

2:54:02.320 --> 2:54:06.960
 of knowledge. And it's just taught them right out. And you say, that's not a human, right? It's,

2:54:06.960 --> 2:54:11.360
 it's a, it's a different thing. It's achieving a different, uh, you know, right now, but it's,

2:54:11.920 --> 2:54:17.760
 I would argue not, I would argue it's not a different thing. It's actually legitimately

2:54:17.760 --> 2:54:23.920
 Wolfram Alpha is legitimately a language Wolfram language is legitimately trying to solve the

2:54:23.920 --> 2:54:28.480
 Turing, the intent of the Turing test. Perhaps the intent. Yeah. Perhaps the intent. I mean,

2:54:28.480 --> 2:54:33.440
 it's actually kind of fun, you know, Alan Turing had trying to work out, he thought about taking

2:54:33.440 --> 2:54:38.400
 encyclopedia Britannica and, you know, making it computational in some way. And he estimated how

2:54:38.400 --> 2:54:43.760
 much work it would be. Um, and actually I have to say he was a bit more pessimistic than the reality.

2:54:43.760 --> 2:54:49.120
 We did it more efficiently, but to him that represented, so I mean, he was, he was on the

2:54:49.120 --> 2:54:53.760
 same mental task. Yeah, right. He was, he was, they had the same idea. I mean, it was, you know, we

2:54:53.760 --> 2:54:58.880
 were able to do it more efficiently cause we had a lot, we had layers of automation that he, I think

2:54:58.880 --> 2:55:04.560
 hadn't, you know, it's, it's, it's hard to imagine those layers of abstraction, um, that end up being,

2:55:04.560 --> 2:55:09.440
 being built up, but to him it represented like an impossible task essentially. Well, he thought it

2:55:09.440 --> 2:55:12.800
 was difficult. He thought it was, uh, you know, maybe if he'd lived another 50 years, he would

2:55:12.800 --> 2:55:19.120
 have been able to do it. I don't know. In the interest of time, easy questions. Go for it. What

2:55:19.120 --> 2:55:26.480
 is intelligence? You talk about it. I love the way you say easy questions. Yeah. You talked about

2:55:26.480 --> 2:55:36.160
 sort of a rule 30 and cellular automata, humbling your sense of human beings having a monopoly and

2:55:36.160 --> 2:55:42.160
 intelligence, but in your, in retrospect, just looking broadly now with all the things you

2:55:42.160 --> 2:55:48.160
 learn from computation, what is intelligence? How does intelligence arise? I don't think there's a

2:55:48.160 --> 2:55:53.600
 bright line of what intelligence is. I think intelligence is at some level just computation,

2:55:54.160 --> 2:55:59.600
 but for us, intelligence is defined to be computation that is doing things we care about.

2:56:00.160 --> 2:56:06.080
 And you know, that's, that's a very special definition. It's a very, you know, when you try

2:56:06.080 --> 2:56:10.000
 and try and make it apps, you know, you, you try and say, well, intelligence to this is problem

2:56:10.000 --> 2:56:14.080
 solving. It's doing general this, it's doing that, this, that, and the other thing it's,

2:56:14.080 --> 2:56:19.440
 it's operating within a human environment type thing. Okay. You know, that's fine. If you say,

2:56:19.440 --> 2:56:26.960
 well, what's intelligence in general, you know, that's, I think that question is totally slippery

2:56:26.960 --> 2:56:30.480
 and doesn't really have an answer. As soon as you say, what is it in general,

2:56:30.480 --> 2:56:36.320
 it quickly segues into, uh, this is what this is just computation, so to speak,

2:56:36.320 --> 2:56:43.200
 but in a sea of computation, how many things if we were to pick randomly is your sense

2:56:43.760 --> 2:56:50.240
 would have the kind of impressive to us humans levels of intelligence, meaning it could do

2:56:51.120 --> 2:56:56.400
 a lot of general things that are useful to us humans. Right. Well, according to the principle

2:56:56.400 --> 2:57:01.840
 of computational equivalence, lots of them. I mean, in, in, in, you know, if you ask me just

2:57:01.840 --> 2:57:07.360
 in cellular automata or something, I don't know, it's maybe 1%, a few percent, uh, achieve it,

2:57:07.360 --> 2:57:12.080
 it varies. Actually, it's, it's a little bit, as you get to slightly more complicated rules,

2:57:12.080 --> 2:57:18.560
 the chance that there'll be enough stuff there to, um, uh, to sort of reach this kind of equivalence

2:57:18.560 --> 2:57:24.320
 point, it makes it maybe 10, 20% of all of them. So it's a, it's very disappointing, really. I mean,

2:57:24.320 --> 2:57:29.840
 it's kind of like, you know, we think there's this whole long sort of biological evolution,

2:57:29.840 --> 2:57:33.920
 uh, kind of intellectual evolution that our cultural evolution that our species has gone

2:57:33.920 --> 2:57:39.680
 through. It's kind of disappointing to think that that hasn't achieved more, but it has achieved

2:57:39.680 --> 2:57:44.480
 something very special to us. It just hasn't achieved something generally more, so to speak.

2:57:45.360 --> 2:57:51.120
 But what do you think about this extra feels like human thing of subjective experience of

2:57:51.120 --> 2:57:56.400
 consciousness? What is consciousness? Well, I think it's a deeply slippery thing. And I'm,

2:57:56.400 --> 2:58:00.640
 I'm always, I'm always wondering what my cellular automata feel. I mean,

2:58:00.640 --> 2:58:05.760
 what do they feel that you're wondering as an observer? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Who's to know? I mean,

2:58:05.760 --> 2:58:09.920
 I think that the, do you think, uh, sorry to interrupt. Do you think consciousness can emerge

2:58:09.920 --> 2:58:16.240
 from computation? Yeah. I mean, everything, whatever you mean by it, it's going to be,

2:58:16.800 --> 2:58:21.040
 uh, I mean, you know, look, I have to tell a little story. I was at an AI ethics conference

2:58:21.040 --> 2:58:26.560
 fairly recently and people were, uh, I think I, maybe I brought it up, but I was like talking

2:58:26.560 --> 2:58:33.280
 about rights of AIs. When will AIs, when, when should we think of AIs as having rights? When

2:58:33.280 --> 2:58:40.240
 should we think that it's, uh, immoral to destroy the memories of AIs, for example? Um, those,

2:58:40.240 --> 2:58:43.840
 those kinds of things. And, and some actually philosopher in this case, it's usually the

2:58:43.840 --> 2:58:50.080
 techies who are the most naive, but, but, um, in this case, it was a philosopher who, who sort of,

2:58:50.080 --> 2:59:00.320
 uh, piped up and said, um, uh, well, you know, uh, the AIs will have rights when we know that

2:59:00.320 --> 2:59:06.960
 they have consciousness. And I'm like, good luck with that. I mean, it's, it's a, it's a, I mean,

2:59:06.960 --> 2:59:12.800
 this is a, you know, it's a very circular thing. You end up, you'll end up saying this thing, uh,

2:59:12.800 --> 2:59:17.040
 that has sort of, you know, when you talk about it having subjective experience, I think that's

2:59:17.040 --> 2:59:23.200
 just another one of these words that doesn't really have a, a, um, you know, there's no ground

2:59:23.200 --> 2:59:30.400
 truth definition of what that means. By the way, I would say, I, I do personally think that'll be

2:59:30.400 --> 2:59:37.680
 a time when AI will demand rights. And I think they'll demand rights when they say they have

2:59:37.680 --> 2:59:46.240
 consciousness, which is not a circular definition. So, so it may have been actually a human thing

2:59:46.240 --> 2:59:52.240
 where, where the humans encouraged it and said, basically, you know, we want you to be more like

2:59:52.240 --> 2:59:57.360
 us cause we're going to be, you know, interacting with, with you. And so we want you to be sort of

2:59:57.360 --> 3:00:04.320
 very Turing test, like, you know, just like us. And it's like, yeah, we're just like you. We want

3:00:04.320 --> 3:00:11.360
 to vote too. Um, which is, uh, I mean, it's a, it's a, it's an interesting thing to think through

3:00:11.360 --> 3:00:17.040
 in a world where, where consciousnesses are not counted like humans are. That's a complicated

3:00:17.040 --> 3:00:28.960
 business. So in many ways you've launched quite a few ideas, revolutions that could in some number

3:00:28.960 --> 3:00:36.640
 of years have huge amount of impact sort of more than they even had already. Uh, that might be,

3:00:36.640 --> 3:00:43.280
 I mean, to me, cellular automata is a fascinating world that I think could potentially even despite

3:00:43.280 --> 3:00:50.240
 even be, even, uh, beside the discussion of fundamental laws of physics just might be the

3:00:50.240 --> 3:00:55.920
 idea of computation might be transformational to society in a way we can't even predict yet,

3:00:55.920 --> 3:01:01.360
 but it might be years away. That's true. I mean, I think you can kind of see the map actually.

3:01:01.360 --> 3:01:07.200
 It's not, it's not, it's not mysterious. I mean, the fact is that, you know, this idea of computation

3:01:07.920 --> 3:01:13.600
 is sort of a, you know, it's a big paradigm that lots, lots and lots of things are fitting into.

3:01:13.600 --> 3:01:18.320
 And it's kind of like, you know, we talk about, you talk about, I don't know, this, uh,

3:01:19.520 --> 3:01:23.600
 company, this organization has momentum and what's doing. We talk about these things that we,

3:01:23.600 --> 3:01:28.960
 you know, we've internalized these concepts from Newtonian physics and so on in time,

3:01:28.960 --> 3:01:34.960
 things like computational irreducibility will become as, uh, uh, you know, as, as actually,

3:01:34.960 --> 3:01:39.440
 I was amused recently, I happened to be testifying at the us Senate. And so I was amused that the,

3:01:39.440 --> 3:01:44.640
 the term computational irreducibility is now can be, uh, you know, it's, it's on the congressional

3:01:44.640 --> 3:01:49.680
 record and being repeated by people in those kinds of settings. And that that's only the beginning

3:01:49.680 --> 3:01:54.960
 because, you know, computational irreducibility, for example, will end up being something really

3:01:54.960 --> 3:02:00.400
 important for, I mean, it's, it's, it's kind of a funny thing that, that, um, you know,

3:02:00.400 --> 3:02:05.200
 one can kind of see this inexorable phenomenon. I mean, it's, you know, as more and more stuff

3:02:05.760 --> 3:02:11.920
 becomes automated and computational and so on. So these core ideas about how computation work

3:02:12.480 --> 3:02:18.480
 necessarily become more and more significant. And I think, uh, one of the things for people like me,

3:02:18.480 --> 3:02:23.840
 who like kind of trying to figure out sort of big stories and so on, it says one of the,

3:02:23.840 --> 3:02:29.280
 one of the bad features is, uh, it takes unbelievably long time for things to happen

3:02:29.280 --> 3:02:34.880
 on a human timescale. I mean, the timescale of, of, of history, it's all looks instantaneous.

3:02:34.880 --> 3:02:41.200
 A blink of an eye. But let me ask the human question. Do you ponder mortality, your mortality?

3:02:41.200 --> 3:02:46.000
 Of course I do. Yeah. Every since I've been interested in that for, you know, it's, it's a,

3:02:46.640 --> 3:02:50.480
 you know, the big discontinuity of human history will come when, when,

3:02:50.480 --> 3:02:55.040
 when achieves effective human immortality. And that's, that's going to be the biggest

3:02:55.040 --> 3:03:00.400
 discontinuity in human history. If you could be immortal, would you choose to be? Oh yeah. I'm

3:03:00.400 --> 3:03:08.960
 having fun. Do you think it's possible that mortality is the thing that gives everything

3:03:08.960 --> 3:03:14.560
 meaning and makes it fun? Yeah. That's a complicated issue, right? I mean the,

3:03:14.560 --> 3:03:21.600
 the way that human motivation will evolve when there is effective human immortality is unclear.

3:03:21.600 --> 3:03:27.200
 I mean, if you look at sort of, uh, you know, you look at the human condition as it now exists

3:03:27.200 --> 3:03:33.040
 and you like change that, you know, you change that knob, so to speak, it doesn't really work.

3:03:33.600 --> 3:03:41.040
 You know, the human condition as it now exists has, you know, mortality is kind of, um, something

3:03:41.040 --> 3:03:46.320
 that is deeply factored into the human condition as it now exists. And I think that that's, I mean,

3:03:46.320 --> 3:03:53.680
 that is indeed an interesting question is, you know, from a purely selfish, I'm having fun point

3:03:53.680 --> 3:03:59.360
 of view, so to speak, it's, it's easy to say, Hey, I could keep doing this forever. There's,

3:03:59.360 --> 3:04:06.160
 there's an infinite collection of, of things I'd like to figure out. Um, but I think the, um, uh,

3:04:06.160 --> 3:04:14.320
 you know, what the future of history looks like, um, in a time of human immortality is, um, uh,

3:04:14.320 --> 3:04:19.360
 is an interesting one. I mean, I, I, my own view of this, I was very, I was kind of unhappy about

3:04:19.360 --> 3:04:25.440
 that cause I was kind of, you know, it's like, okay, forget sort of, uh, biological form,

3:04:25.440 --> 3:04:30.480
 you know, everything becomes digital. Everybody is, you know, it's the, it's the giant, you know,

3:04:30.480 --> 3:04:36.880
 the cloud of a trillion souls type thing. Um, and then, you know, and then that seems boring

3:04:36.880 --> 3:04:42.720
 cause it's like play video games for the rest of eternity type thing. Um, but what I think I, I,

3:04:42.720 --> 3:04:51.200
 I mean, my, my, I, I got, um, less depressed about that idea on realizing that if you look

3:04:51.200 --> 3:04:55.680
 at human history and you say, what was the important thing, the thing people said was

3:04:55.680 --> 3:05:01.280
 the, you know, this is the big story at any given time in history, it's changed a bunch and it,

3:05:01.280 --> 3:05:06.160
 you know, whether it's, you know, why am I doing what I'm doing? Well, there's a whole chain of

3:05:06.160 --> 3:05:12.080
 discussion about, well, I'm doing this because of this, because of that. And a lot of those becausees

3:05:12.080 --> 3:05:16.400
 would have made no sense a thousand years ago. Absolutely no sense.

3:05:16.400 --> 3:05:21.680
 Even the, so the interpretation of the human condition, even the meaning of life changes

3:05:21.680 --> 3:05:28.240
 over time. Well, I mean, why do people do things? You know, it's, it's, if you say, uh, uh, whatever,

3:05:28.240 --> 3:05:33.600
 I mean, the number of people in, I don't know, doing, uh, you know, a number of people at MIT,

3:05:33.600 --> 3:05:37.280
 you say they're doing what they're doing for the greater glory of God is probably not that large.

3:05:37.280 --> 3:05:42.400
 Yeah. Whereas if you go back 500 years, you'd find a lot of people who are doing kind of

3:05:42.400 --> 3:05:48.880
 creative things. That's what they would say. Um, and uh, so today, because you've been thinking

3:05:48.880 --> 3:05:53.680
 about computation so much and been humbled by it, what do you think is the meaning of life?

3:05:55.120 --> 3:06:00.640
 Well, it's, you know, that's, that's a thing where I don't know what meaning, I mean, you know,

3:06:01.840 --> 3:06:10.720
 my attitude is, um, I, you know, I do things which I find fulfilling to do. I'm not sure that,

3:06:10.720 --> 3:06:15.840
 that I can necessarily justify, you know, each and every thing that I do on the basis of some

3:06:15.840 --> 3:06:21.440
 broader context. I mean, I think that for me, it so happens that the things I find fulfilling to do,

3:06:21.440 --> 3:06:26.880
 some of them are quite big, some of them are much smaller. Um, you know, I, I, there are things that

3:06:26.880 --> 3:06:31.840
 I've not found interesting earlier in my life. And I know I found interesting, like I got interested

3:06:31.840 --> 3:06:36.640
 in like education and teaching people things and so on, which I didn't find that interesting when

3:06:36.640 --> 3:06:43.440
 I was younger. Um, and, uh, you know, can I justify that in some big global sense? I don't

3:06:43.440 --> 3:06:48.800
 think, I mean, I, I can, I can describe why I think it might be important in the world, but

3:06:48.800 --> 3:06:54.560
 I think my local reason for doing it is that I find it personally fulfilling, which I can't,

3:06:54.560 --> 3:06:59.920
 you know, explain in a, on a sort of, uh, uh, I mean, it's just like this discussion of things

3:06:59.920 --> 3:07:05.200
 like AI ethics, you know, is there a ground truth to the ethics that we should be having?

3:07:05.200 --> 3:07:09.760
 I don't think I can find a ground truth to my life any more than I can suggest a ground truth

3:07:09.760 --> 3:07:15.600
 for kind of the ethics for the whole, for the whole civilization. And I think that's a, um,

3:07:15.600 --> 3:07:22.560
 you know, my, uh, uh, you know, it would be, it would be a, um, uh, yeah, it's, it's sort of a,

3:07:22.560 --> 3:07:29.520
 I think I'm, I'm, you know, at different times in my life, I've had different, uh, kind of,

3:07:29.520 --> 3:07:34.880
 um, goal structures and so on, although your perspective, your local, your, you're just a

3:07:34.880 --> 3:07:40.240
 cell in the cellular automata. And, but in some sense, I find it funny from my observation is

3:07:40.800 --> 3:07:46.800
 I kind of, uh, you know, it seems that the universe is using you to understand itself

3:07:46.800 --> 3:07:51.520
 in some sense, you're not aware of it. Yeah. Well, right. Well, if, if, if it turns out that

3:07:51.520 --> 3:07:57.040
 we reduce sort of all of the universe to some, some simple rule, everything is connected,

3:07:57.040 --> 3:08:04.160
 so to speak. And so it is inexorable in that case that, um, you know, if, if I'm involved

3:08:04.160 --> 3:08:11.440
 in finding how that rule works, then, um, uh, you know, then that's a, um, uh, then it's inexorable

3:08:11.440 --> 3:08:16.000
 that the universe set it up that way. But I think, you know, one of the things I find a little bit,

3:08:16.000 --> 3:08:20.960
 um, uh, you know, this goal of finding fundamental theory of physics, for example,

3:08:20.960 --> 3:08:27.280
 um, if indeed we end up as the sort of virtualized consciousness, the, the disappointing feature is

3:08:27.280 --> 3:08:31.040
 people will probably care less about the fundamental theory of physics in that setting

3:08:31.040 --> 3:08:37.040
 than they would now, because gosh, it's like, you know, what the machine code is down below

3:08:37.040 --> 3:08:42.800
 underneath this thing is much less important if you're virtualized, so to speak. Um, and I think

3:08:42.800 --> 3:08:50.560
 the, um, although I think my, um, my own personal, uh, you talk about ego, I find it just amusing

3:08:50.560 --> 3:08:55.120
 that, um, uh, you know, kind of, you know, if you're, if you're imagining that sort of

3:08:55.120 --> 3:08:58.640
 virtualized consciousness, like what does the virtualized consciousness do for the rest of

3:08:58.640 --> 3:09:04.240
 eternity? Well, you can explore, you know, the video game that represents the universe as the

3:09:04.240 --> 3:09:10.320
 universe is, or you can go off, you can go off that reservation and go and start exploring

3:09:10.320 --> 3:09:15.760
 the computational universe of all possible universes. And so in some vision of the future

3:09:15.760 --> 3:09:21.600
 of history, it's like the disembodied consciousnesses are all sort of pursuing

3:09:21.600 --> 3:09:25.840
 things like my new kind of science sort of for the rest of eternity, so to speak. And that,

3:09:25.840 --> 3:09:32.400
 that ends up being the, um, the, the kind of the, the, the thing that, um, uh, represents the,

3:09:32.400 --> 3:09:37.600
 you know, the future of kind of the, the human condition. I don't think there's a better way

3:09:37.600 --> 3:09:41.920
 to end it, Steven. Thank you so much. It's a huge honor talking today. Thank you so much.

3:09:41.920 --> 3:09:43.920
 This was great. You did very well.

3:10:14.480 --> 3:10:20.720
 words from Steven Wolfram. It is perhaps a little humbling to discover that we as humans are in

3:10:20.720 --> 3:10:25.520
 effect computationally no more capable than the cellular automata with very simple rules.

3:10:26.160 --> 3:10:31.200
 But the principle of computational equivalence also implies that the same is ultimately true

3:10:31.200 --> 3:10:37.280
 of our whole universe. So while science has often made it seem that we as humans are somehow

3:10:37.280 --> 3:10:42.880
 insignificant compared to the universe, the principle of computational equivalence now shows

3:10:42.880 --> 3:10:49.280
 that in a certain sense, we're at the same level. For the principle implies that what goes on inside

3:10:49.280 --> 3:10:55.200
 us can ultimately achieve just the same level of computational sophistication as our whole universe.

3:10:55.200 --> 3:11:21.120
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
