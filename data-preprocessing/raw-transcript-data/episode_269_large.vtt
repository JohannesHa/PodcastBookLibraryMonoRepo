00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
 The following is a conversation with Lee Cronin,

00:02.720 --> 00:05.160
 a chemist from University of Glasgow,

00:05.160 --> 00:07.440
 who's one of the most fascinating, brilliant,

00:07.440 --> 00:10.660
 out of the box thinking scientists I've ever spoken to.

00:11.520 --> 00:14.600
 This episode was recorded more than two weeks ago,

00:14.600 --> 00:17.200
 so the war in Ukraine is not mentioned.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.400
 I have been spending a lot of time each day

00:19.400 --> 00:22.080
 talking to people in Ukraine and Russia.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.920
 I have family, friends, colleagues,

00:23.920 --> 00:27.340
 and loved ones in both countries.

00:27.340 --> 00:30.240
 I will try to release a solo episode on this war,

00:30.240 --> 00:31.880
 but I've been failing to find the words

00:31.880 --> 00:36.000
 that make sense of it for myself and others,

00:36.000 --> 00:37.600
 so I may not.

00:37.600 --> 00:40.640
 I ask for your understanding no matter which path I take.

00:41.680 --> 00:44.400
 Most of my time is spent trying to help

00:44.400 --> 00:46.240
 as much as I can privately.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.360
 I'm talking to people who are suffering,

00:49.360 --> 00:51.420
 who are angry, afraid.

00:52.760 --> 00:55.700
 When I returned to this conversation with Lee,

00:55.700 --> 00:57.500
 I couldn't help but smile.

00:57.500 --> 01:01.560
 He's a beautiful, brilliant, and hilarious human being.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.680
 He's basically a human manifestation

01:03.680 --> 01:06.480
 of the mad scientist Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty.

01:07.960 --> 01:10.960
 I thought about quitting this podcast for a time,

01:10.960 --> 01:13.260
 but for now at least, I'll keep going.

01:14.100 --> 01:16.080
 I love people too much.

01:16.080 --> 01:17.880
 You, the listener.

01:17.880 --> 01:21.320
 I meet folks on the street or when I run.

01:21.320 --> 01:23.600
 You say a few kind words about the podcast

01:23.600 --> 01:26.800
 and we talk about life, the small things,

01:26.800 --> 01:28.240
 and the big things.

01:28.240 --> 01:29.500
 All of it gives me hope.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.360
 People are just amazing.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.040
 You are amazing.

01:34.040 --> 01:37.280
 I ask for your support, wisdom, and patience

01:37.280 --> 01:41.480
 as I keep going with this silly little podcast,

01:41.480 --> 01:43.880
 including through some difficult conversations

01:45.760 --> 01:49.460
 and hopefully many fascinating and fun ones too.

01:49.460 --> 01:51.460
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:51.460 --> 01:53.500
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:53.500 --> 01:54.820
 in the description.

01:54.820 --> 01:58.580
 And now, dear friends, here's Lee Cronin.

01:59.580 --> 02:02.780
 How do you think life originated on Earth

02:02.780 --> 02:06.580
 and what insights does that give us about life?

02:06.580 --> 02:08.540
 If we go back to the origin of Earth

02:08.540 --> 02:13.540
 and you think about maybe 4.7, 4.6, 4.5 billion years ago,

02:13.540 --> 02:14.780
 the planet was quite hot.

02:14.780 --> 02:16.820
 There was a limited number of minerals.

02:16.820 --> 02:20.020
 There was some carbon, some water, and I think

02:20.020 --> 02:22.340
 that maybe it's a really simple set of chemistry

02:22.340 --> 02:25.300
 that we really don't understand.

02:25.300 --> 02:27.660
 So that means you've got a finite number of elements

02:27.660 --> 02:31.260
 that are going to react very simply with one another

02:31.260 --> 02:33.220
 and out of that mess comes a cell.

02:33.220 --> 02:35.940
 So literally sand turns into cells

02:35.940 --> 02:38.020
 and it seems to happen quick.

02:38.020 --> 02:41.460
 So what I think I can say with some degree of,

02:41.460 --> 02:43.940
 I think not certainty, but curiosity,

02:43.940 --> 02:47.300
 genuine curiosity is that life happened fast.

02:47.300 --> 02:48.940
 Yeah, so when we say fast,

02:50.340 --> 02:53.060
 this is a pretty surprising fact

02:53.060 --> 02:55.100
 and maybe you can actually correct me and elaborate,

02:55.100 --> 02:59.500
 but it seems like most, like 70 or 80% of the time

02:59.500 --> 03:01.460
 that Earth has been around, there's been life on it,

03:01.460 --> 03:03.180
 like some very significant percentage.

03:03.180 --> 03:06.300
 So when you say fast, like the slow part

03:06.300 --> 03:09.660
 is from single cell or from bacteria

03:09.660 --> 03:11.700
 to something more complicated, organisms.

03:11.700 --> 03:14.900
 It seems like most of the time that Earth has been around,

03:14.900 --> 03:18.940
 it's been single cell or like very basic organisms,

03:18.940 --> 03:20.460
 like a couple billion years.

03:20.460 --> 03:21.780
 But yeah, you're right.

03:21.780 --> 03:26.180
 That's really, I recently kind of revisited our history

03:26.180 --> 03:30.180
 and saw this and I was just looking at the timeline.

03:30.180 --> 03:33.780
 Wait a minute, like how did life just spring up so quickly?

03:33.780 --> 03:35.620
 Like really quickly.

03:35.620 --> 03:38.900
 That makes me think that it really wanted to.

03:38.900 --> 03:42.900
 Like put another way, it's very easy for life to spring.

03:42.900 --> 03:45.900
 Yeah, I agree, I think it's much more inevitable

03:45.900 --> 03:49.900
 and I think I try to kind of, not provoke,

03:49.900 --> 03:51.900
 but try and push chemists to think about,

03:51.900 --> 03:54.900
 because chemists are central to this problem, right?

03:54.900 --> 03:57.260
 Of understanding the origin of life on Earth, at least,

03:57.260 --> 03:59.500
 because we're made of chemistry.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.540
 But I wonder if the origin of life on a planet,

04:02.540 --> 04:05.100
 or sorry, the emergence of life on the planet is as,

04:05.100 --> 04:08.100
 common as the formation of a star.

04:08.100 --> 04:10.700
 And if you start framing it in that way,

04:10.700 --> 04:12.220
 it allows you to then look at the universe

04:12.220 --> 04:14.300
 slightly differently, because,

04:14.300 --> 04:16.700
 and we can get into this, I think, in quite some detail,

04:16.700 --> 04:19.500
 but I think, to come back to your question,

04:19.500 --> 04:23.100
 I have little idea of how life got started,

04:23.100 --> 04:24.900
 but I know it was simple.

04:24.900 --> 04:27.700
 And I know that the process of selection

04:27.700 --> 04:31.700
 had to occur before the, by the end of the day,

04:31.700 --> 04:35.500
 the selection had to occur before the biology

04:35.500 --> 04:39.780
 was established, so that selection built the framework

04:39.780 --> 04:43.500
 from which life kind of grew in complexity

04:43.500 --> 04:46.300
 and capability and functionality and autonomy.

04:46.300 --> 04:48.300
 And I think these are all really important words

04:48.300 --> 04:51.140
 that we can unpack over the next while.

04:51.140 --> 04:53.100
 Can you say all the words again?

04:53.100 --> 04:57.940
 So you said selection, so natural selection,

04:57.940 --> 04:59.820
 the original A, B testing.

04:59.820 --> 05:01.900
 And so, and then complexity,

05:01.900 --> 05:05.500
 and then the degree of autonomy and sophistication,

05:05.500 --> 05:09.020
 because I think that people misunderstand what life is.

05:10.140 --> 05:12.020
 Some people say that life is a cell,

05:12.020 --> 05:15.300
 and some people that say that life is a virus

05:15.300 --> 05:19.820
 or life is an on off switch.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.020
 I don't think it's that,

05:21.020 --> 05:24.100
 life is the universe developing a memory.

05:25.020 --> 05:27.500
 And the laws of physics and the way,

05:27.500 --> 05:28.900
 well, there are no laws of physics.

05:28.900 --> 05:32.860
 It's just memory free stuff, right?

05:32.860 --> 05:34.460
 So there's only a finite number of ways

05:34.460 --> 05:38.580
 you can arrange the fundamental particles to do things.

05:38.580 --> 05:43.420
 Life is the universe developing a memory.

05:43.420 --> 05:48.420
 So it's like sewing a piece of art slowly,

05:49.340 --> 05:50.580
 and then you can look back at it.

05:50.580 --> 05:55.580
 So, so there's a stickiness to life.

05:56.580 --> 05:58.660
 It's like universe doing stuff.

05:58.660 --> 06:01.820
 And when you say memory, it's like there's a stickiness

06:01.820 --> 06:04.100
 to a bunch of the stuff that's building together.

06:04.100 --> 06:07.220
 So like you can, in a stable way,

06:07.220 --> 06:10.660
 like trace back the complexity

06:10.660 --> 06:13.060
 and that tells a coherent story.

06:13.060 --> 06:14.500
 Yeah, and I think, yeah.

06:14.500 --> 06:19.500
 Okay, that's, by the way, very poetic and beautiful.

06:19.540 --> 06:22.160
 Life is the universe developing a memory.

06:24.180 --> 06:25.900
 Okay, and then there's autonomy,

06:25.900 --> 06:27.580
 you said complexity we'll talk about,

06:27.580 --> 06:30.100
 but it's a really interesting idea

06:30.100 --> 06:33.540
 that selection preceded biology.

06:33.540 --> 06:35.060
 Yeah, I think.

06:35.060 --> 06:38.420
 So first of all, what is chemistry?

06:38.420 --> 06:41.380
 Like does sand still count as chemistry?

06:41.380 --> 06:43.980
 Sure, I mean, as a chemist, a card carrying chemist,

06:43.980 --> 06:45.940
 if I'm allowed a card, I don't know.

06:45.940 --> 06:46.780
 Don't know what I am most days, actually.

06:46.780 --> 06:48.260
 What is a card made of?

06:48.260 --> 06:49.660
 That's what I'm thinking.

06:49.660 --> 06:52.340
 What's the chemical composition of the card?

06:52.340 --> 06:53.860
 So what is chemistry?

06:53.860 --> 06:55.620
 Well, chemistry is the thing that happens

06:55.620 --> 06:58.340
 when you bring electrons together and you form bonds.

06:58.340 --> 07:00.340
 So bonds, well, I say to people

07:00.340 --> 07:02.380
 when they talk about life elsewhere,

07:02.380 --> 07:04.780
 and I just say, well, there's bonds, there's hope,

07:04.780 --> 07:07.020
 because bonds allow you to get heterogeneity.

07:07.020 --> 07:09.500
 They allow you to record those memories,

07:09.500 --> 07:11.340
 or at least on Earth.

07:11.340 --> 07:15.580
 You could imagine a Stanislav Lemtri world

07:15.580 --> 07:17.220
 where you might have life emerging

07:17.220 --> 07:19.660
 or intelligence emerging before life.

07:19.660 --> 07:21.980
 That may be something like Solaris or something,

07:21.980 --> 07:25.200
 but to get to selection,

07:25.200 --> 07:28.540
 if you can form, if atoms can combine and form bonds,

07:28.540 --> 07:32.500
 those bonds, those atoms can bond to different elements

07:32.500 --> 07:35.620
 and those molecules will have different identities

07:35.620 --> 07:37.140
 and interact with each other differently,

07:37.140 --> 07:39.940
 and then you can start to have some degree of causation

07:39.940 --> 07:44.940
 or interaction and then selection and then existence.

07:45.100 --> 07:49.820
 And then you go up the kind of the path of complexity.

07:49.820 --> 07:52.500
 And so at least on Earth, as we know it,

07:52.500 --> 07:56.380
 there is a sufficient pool of available chemicals

07:56.380 --> 08:01.380
 to start searching that combinatorial space of bonds.

08:01.460 --> 08:03.820
 So, okay, this is a really interesting question.

08:03.820 --> 08:04.780
 Let's lay it out.

08:04.780 --> 08:07.900
 So bonds, almost like cards.

08:07.900 --> 08:11.980
 We say there's bonds, there is life,

08:11.980 --> 08:14.260
 there's intelligence, there's consciousness.

08:14.260 --> 08:18.060
 And what you just made me realize is

08:18.060 --> 08:23.060
 that those can emerge, let's put bonds aside,

08:24.620 --> 08:27.180
 those can emerge in any order.

08:27.180 --> 08:28.820
 That's really brilliant.

08:28.820 --> 08:32.140
 So intelligence can come before life.

08:32.140 --> 08:36.200
 It's like panpsychists believe that consciousness,

08:36.200 --> 08:41.200
 I guess, comes before life and before intelligence.

08:41.620 --> 08:43.900
 So consciousness permeates all matter,

08:43.900 --> 08:46.020
 it's some kind of fabric of reality.

08:46.020 --> 08:47.940
 Okay, so like within this framework,

08:47.940 --> 08:49.980
 you can kind of arrange everything,

08:49.980 --> 08:52.340
 but you need to have the bonds

08:53.900 --> 08:55.340
 that precedes everything else.

08:55.340 --> 08:57.580
 Oh, and the other thing is selection.

08:57.580 --> 09:02.460
 So like the mechanism of selection, that could proceed.

09:02.460 --> 09:04.660
 See, couldn't that proceed bonds too?

09:04.660 --> 09:05.740
 Whatever the hell selection is.

09:05.740 --> 09:09.260
 So I would say that there is an elegant order to it.

09:09.260 --> 09:13.580
 Bonds allow selection, allows the emergence of life,

09:13.580 --> 09:15.860
 allows the emergence of multicellularity

09:15.860 --> 09:18.300
 and then more information processing,

09:18.300 --> 09:19.700
 building state machines all the way up.

09:19.700 --> 09:23.540
 However, you could imagine a situation if you had,

09:23.540 --> 09:25.380
 I don't know, a neutron star or a sun

09:25.380 --> 09:28.660
 or what a ferromagnetic loops interacting with one another

09:28.660 --> 09:31.100
 and these oscillators building state machines

09:31.100 --> 09:32.580
 and these state machines reading something

09:32.580 --> 09:34.300
 out in the environment.

09:34.300 --> 09:36.460
 Over time, these state machines would be able

09:36.460 --> 09:39.340
 to literally record what happened in the past

09:39.340 --> 09:41.560
 and sense what's going on in the present

09:41.560 --> 09:43.140
 and imagine the future.

09:43.140 --> 09:46.220
 However, I don't think it's ever gonna be

09:46.220 --> 09:49.020
 within a human comprehension, that type of life.

09:49.900 --> 09:53.220
 I wouldn't count it out because whenever you say,

09:53.220 --> 09:55.900
 I know in science, whenever I say something's impossible,

09:55.900 --> 09:56.740
 I then wake up the next day and say,

09:56.740 --> 09:57.860
 no, that's actually wrong.

09:57.860 --> 10:00.540
 I mean, there are some limits, of course.

10:00.540 --> 10:03.480
 I don't see myself traveling fast and light anytime soon,

10:03.480 --> 10:04.320
 but...

10:04.320 --> 10:05.620
 Eric Weinstein says that's possible,

10:05.620 --> 10:06.660
 so he will say you're wrong.

10:06.660 --> 10:08.700
 Sure, but I'm an experimentalist as well,

10:08.700 --> 10:11.380
 so one of my, I have two superpowers.

10:11.380 --> 10:14.540
 My stupidity, and I don't mean that as a,

10:14.540 --> 10:16.620
 I'm like absolutely completely witless,

10:16.620 --> 10:19.000
 but I mean my ability to kind of just start again

10:19.000 --> 10:22.220
 and ask the question and then do it with an experiment.

10:22.220 --> 10:24.340
 I always wanted to be a theoretician growing up,

10:24.340 --> 10:27.140
 but I just didn't have the intellectual capability,

10:27.140 --> 10:30.580
 but I was able to think of experiments in my head

10:30.580 --> 10:35.580
 I could then do in my lab or when I was a child outside

10:35.780 --> 10:37.820
 and then those experiments in my head

10:37.820 --> 10:40.020
 and then outside reinforced one another.

10:40.020 --> 10:42.500
 So I think that's a very good way of kind of

10:42.500 --> 10:44.340
 grounding the science, right?

10:44.340 --> 10:46.660
 Well, that's a nice way to think about theoreticians

10:46.660 --> 10:49.620
 is they're just people who run experiments in their head.

10:49.620 --> 10:51.620
 I mean, that's exactly what Einstein did, right?

10:51.620 --> 10:54.420
 But you were also capable of doing that in the head,

10:54.420 --> 10:57.000
 in your head, inside your head and in the real world

10:57.000 --> 10:59.420
 and the connection between the two

10:59.420 --> 11:02.560
 is when you first discovered your superpower stupidity.

11:02.560 --> 11:03.400
 I like it.

11:03.400 --> 11:04.220
 Yes, there you go.

11:04.220 --> 11:05.460
 What's the second superpower?

11:05.460 --> 11:08.420
 Your accent or is that?

11:08.420 --> 11:09.860
 Well, I don't know.

11:09.860 --> 11:11.580
 I am genuinely curious.

11:11.580 --> 11:15.020
 So I have, like everybody, ego problems,

11:15.020 --> 11:16.900
 but my curiosity is bigger than my ego.

11:16.900 --> 11:20.340
 So as long as that happens, I can cope.

11:20.340 --> 11:21.260
 That's awesome.

11:21.260 --> 11:22.260
 That is so powerful.

11:22.260 --> 11:23.940
 You're just dropping some powerful lines.

11:23.940 --> 11:26.740
 So curiosity is bigger than ego.

11:26.740 --> 11:28.100
 That's something I have to think about

11:28.100 --> 11:30.780
 because you always struggle about the role of ego in life

11:30.780 --> 11:35.780
 and that's so nice to think about,

11:36.180 --> 11:37.720
 don't think about the size of ego,

11:37.720 --> 11:38.900
 the absolute size of ego.

11:38.900 --> 11:40.780
 Think about the relative size of ego

11:40.780 --> 11:44.260
 to the other horses pulling at you.

11:44.260 --> 11:46.600
 If the curiosity one is bigger,

11:46.600 --> 11:51.300
 then ego will do just fine and make you fun to talk to.

11:51.300 --> 11:53.620
 Anyway, so those are the two superpowers.

11:53.620 --> 11:55.300
 How do those connect to natural selection

11:55.300 --> 11:58.460
 or selection and bonds and, I forgot already,

11:58.460 --> 11:59.960
 life and consciousness?

11:59.960 --> 12:02.060
 So we're going back to selection in the universe

12:02.060 --> 12:03.820
 and origin of life on Earth.

12:03.820 --> 12:07.780
 I mean, selection, I'm convinced that selection

12:07.780 --> 12:09.500
 is a force in the universe.

12:09.500 --> 12:14.460
 Not a fundamental force, but it is a directing force

12:14.460 --> 12:18.140
 because existence, although existence appears

12:18.140 --> 12:21.100
 to be the default, the existence of what,

12:21.100 --> 12:24.340
 why does, and we can get to this later, I think,

12:24.340 --> 12:29.140
 but it's amazing that discrete things exist

12:29.140 --> 12:31.000
 and you see this cup.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.740
 It's not the sexiest cup in the world,

12:33.740 --> 12:35.020
 but it's pretty functional.

12:35.020 --> 12:38.780
 This cup, the complexity of this cup

12:38.780 --> 12:39.760
 isn't just in the object.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.180
 It is literally the lineage of people making cups

12:42.180 --> 12:44.440
 and recognizing that, seeing that in their head,

12:44.440 --> 12:45.720
 making an abstraction of a cup,

12:45.720 --> 12:47.120
 and then making a different one.

12:47.120 --> 12:50.460
 So I wonder how many billions of cups

12:50.460 --> 12:52.920
 have come before this one,

12:52.920 --> 12:55.080
 and that's the process of selection and existence,

12:55.080 --> 12:56.620
 and the only reason the cup is still used

12:56.620 --> 12:57.460
 is quite useful.

12:57.460 --> 12:58.300
 I like the handle.

12:58.300 --> 12:59.780
 It's convenient, so I don't die.

12:59.780 --> 13:03.860
 I keep hydration, and so I think we are missing

13:03.860 --> 13:07.060
 something fundamental in the universe about selection,

13:07.060 --> 13:12.060
 and I think what biology is is a selection amplifier,

13:12.580 --> 13:14.940
 and that this is where autonomy comes in,

13:14.940 --> 13:17.300
 and actually I think that how humanity is gonna,

13:17.300 --> 13:20.420
 humans and autonomous robots,

13:20.420 --> 13:22.180
 or whatever we're gonna call them in the future,

13:22.180 --> 13:24.620
 will supercharge that even further.

13:24.620 --> 13:26.860
 So selection is happening in the universe,

13:26.860 --> 13:28.780
 but if you look in the asteroid belt,

13:28.780 --> 13:31.580
 selection, if objects are being kicked in and out

13:31.580 --> 13:35.060
 of the asteroid belt, those trajectories are quite complex.

13:35.060 --> 13:37.060
 You don't really look at that as productive selection

13:37.060 --> 13:40.020
 because it's not doing anything to improve its function,

13:40.020 --> 13:40.860
 but is it?

13:40.860 --> 13:43.680
 The asteroid belt has existed for some time,

13:43.680 --> 13:45.500
 so there is some selection going on,

13:45.500 --> 13:49.480
 but the functionality is somewhat limited.

13:49.480 --> 13:53.400
 On Earth, at the formation of Earth,

13:53.400 --> 13:56.840
 interaction of chemicals and molecules in the environment

13:56.840 --> 13:59.300
 gave selection, and then things could happen,

13:59.300 --> 14:01.780
 because you could think about, in chemistry,

14:01.780 --> 14:04.060
 we could have an infinite number of reactions happen,

14:04.060 --> 14:06.420
 but all the reactions that are allowed to happen

14:06.420 --> 14:07.300
 don't happen, why?

14:07.300 --> 14:08.860
 Because there are energy barriers.

14:08.860 --> 14:12.060
 So there must be some things called catalysts out there,

14:12.060 --> 14:14.780
 or there are bits of minerals that,

14:14.780 --> 14:17.020
 when two molecules get together in that mineral,

14:17.020 --> 14:19.180
 it lowers the energy barrier for the reaction,

14:19.180 --> 14:21.540
 and so the reaction is promoted.

14:21.540 --> 14:24.420
 So suddenly you get one reaction over another

14:24.420 --> 14:26.140
 series of possibilities occurring

14:26.140 --> 14:28.100
 that makes a particular molecule,

14:28.100 --> 14:30.020
 and this keeps happening in steps,

14:30.020 --> 14:31.620
 and before you know it,

14:31.620 --> 14:34.380
 almost these waves as discrete reactions work together,

14:34.380 --> 14:38.060
 and you start to build a machinery

14:38.060 --> 14:41.860
 that is run by existence.

14:41.860 --> 14:44.940
 So as you go forward in time,

14:44.940 --> 14:48.020
 the fact that the molecules, the bonds are getting,

14:48.020 --> 14:49.500
 there are more bonds in a molecule,

14:49.500 --> 14:50.900
 there's more function,

14:50.900 --> 14:52.460
 there's more capability for this molecule

14:52.460 --> 14:55.300
 to interact with other molecules, to redirect them,

14:55.300 --> 14:57.140
 it's like a series of little,

14:57.140 --> 14:59.980
 and I don't want to use this term too much,

14:59.980 --> 15:01.620
 but it's almost thinking about

15:01.620 --> 15:04.660
 the simplest von Neumann constructor,

15:04.660 --> 15:05.980
 that's the simplest molecule

15:05.980 --> 15:07.500
 that could build a more complicated molecule

15:07.500 --> 15:09.100
 to build a more complicated molecule,

15:09.100 --> 15:09.980
 and before you know it,

15:09.980 --> 15:11.420
 when that more complicated molecule

15:11.420 --> 15:14.740
 can act on the causal chain that's produced itself

15:14.740 --> 15:15.900
 and change it,

15:15.900 --> 15:18.460
 suddenly you start to get towards some kind of autonomy,

15:18.460 --> 15:21.820
 and that's where life, I think, emerges in earnest.

15:21.820 --> 15:24.700
 Every single word in the past few paragraphs,

15:24.700 --> 15:26.100
 let's break those apart,

15:26.100 --> 15:30.900
 but who's von Neumann, what's a constructor,

15:30.900 --> 15:33.900
 the closing of the loop that you're talking about,

15:35.900 --> 15:37.940
 the molecule that starts becoming,

15:37.940 --> 15:41.820
 I think you said like the smallest von Neumann constructor,

15:41.820 --> 15:43.300
 the smallest, the minimal,

15:43.300 --> 15:45.420
 so what do all those things mean,

15:45.420 --> 15:47.980
 and what is, what are we supposed to imagine

15:47.980 --> 15:51.260
 when we think about the smallest von Neumann constructor?

15:51.260 --> 15:54.220
 So John von Neumann is a real hero,

15:54.220 --> 15:56.060
 actually, not just me, but many people, I think,

15:56.060 --> 15:58.580
 computer science and physics.

15:58.580 --> 16:00.540
 He was an incredible intellect

16:01.500 --> 16:03.020
 who probably solved a lot of the problems

16:03.020 --> 16:04.140
 that we're working on today

16:04.140 --> 16:05.540
 and just forgot to write them down.

16:05.540 --> 16:06.540
 Yeah.

16:06.540 --> 16:09.460
 And I'm not sure if it's John von Neumann or Johnny,

16:09.460 --> 16:10.780
 as I think his friends called him,

16:10.780 --> 16:14.820
 but I think he was Hungarian, a mathematician,

16:14.820 --> 16:16.180
 came to the US,

16:16.180 --> 16:19.620
 and basically was involved in the Manhattan Project

16:19.620 --> 16:21.420
 in developing computation

16:21.420 --> 16:24.300
 and came up with all sorts of ideas,

16:24.300 --> 16:25.700
 and I think he was one of the first people

16:25.700 --> 16:27.980
 to come up with cellular automata.

16:27.980 --> 16:28.820
 And, but he...

16:28.820 --> 16:29.660
 Oh, really?

16:29.660 --> 16:30.500
 I didn't know this little fact.

16:30.500 --> 16:31.860
 I think so, I think so.

16:31.860 --> 16:32.700
 And I think...

16:32.700 --> 16:34.860
 Well, anyway, if he didn't come up with it,

16:34.860 --> 16:37.260
 he probably did come up with it and didn't write it down.

16:37.260 --> 16:38.820
 There was a couple of people who did at the same time,

16:38.820 --> 16:40.140
 and then Conway obviously took it on,

16:40.140 --> 16:42.620
 and then Wolfram loves CAs.

16:42.620 --> 16:44.740
 There is his fabric of the universe.

16:44.740 --> 16:48.340
 And what I think he imagined was that he wasn't satisfied,

16:48.340 --> 16:51.380
 and this may be incorrect recollection,

16:51.380 --> 16:53.820
 but a lot of what I say is gonna be kind of

16:55.060 --> 16:56.140
 just way out of my...

16:56.140 --> 16:59.020
 You're, Lee, you're just part of the universe

17:00.380 --> 17:02.300
 creating its memory, designing...

17:02.300 --> 17:04.180
 Exactly, yeah, rewriting history.

17:04.180 --> 17:05.020
 Rewriting history.

17:05.020 --> 17:06.380
 Exactly, imperfectly.

17:06.380 --> 17:09.100
 So, but what I mean is I think he liked this idea

17:09.100 --> 17:14.100
 of thinking about how could a Turing machine

17:14.300 --> 17:16.780
 literally build itself without a Turing machine, right?

17:16.780 --> 17:19.620
 It's like literally how did state machines emerge?

17:19.620 --> 17:21.660
 And I think that von Neumann constructors,

17:21.660 --> 17:24.780
 he wanted to conceive of a minimal thing,

17:24.780 --> 17:28.420
 autonomous, that could build itself.

17:28.420 --> 17:30.740
 And what would those rules look like in the world?

17:30.740 --> 17:32.820
 And that's what a von Neumann kind of constructor

17:32.820 --> 17:35.500
 looked like, like it's a minimal hypothetical object

17:35.500 --> 17:37.900
 that could build itself, self replicate.

17:37.900 --> 17:41.340
 And I'm really fascinated by that

17:41.340 --> 17:45.100
 because I think that although it's probably not

17:45.100 --> 17:47.980
 exactly what happened, it's a nice model

17:47.980 --> 17:49.540
 because as chemists, if we could go back

17:49.540 --> 17:51.980
 to the origin of life and think about

17:51.980 --> 17:55.980
 what is a minimal machine that can get structured randomly?

17:55.980 --> 18:00.980
 So like with no prime mover, with no architect,

18:01.260 --> 18:03.620
 it assembles through just existence.

18:03.620 --> 18:06.220
 So random stuff bumping in together

18:06.220 --> 18:07.860
 and you make this first molecule.

18:07.860 --> 18:11.540
 So you have molecule A and molecule A interacts

18:11.540 --> 18:14.100
 with another random molecule B and they get together

18:14.100 --> 18:15.540
 and they realize by working together

18:15.540 --> 18:17.620
 they can make more of themselves,

18:17.620 --> 18:19.580
 but then they realize they can mutate

18:19.580 --> 18:21.460
 so they can make AB prime.

18:21.460 --> 18:24.100
 So AB prime is different to AB

18:24.100 --> 18:27.500
 and then AB prime can then act back

18:27.500 --> 18:29.700
 where A and B are being created

18:29.700 --> 18:32.980
 and slightly nudge that causal chain

18:32.980 --> 18:37.980
 and make AB prime more evolvable or learn more.

18:38.820 --> 18:40.580
 So that's the closing the loop part.

18:40.580 --> 18:42.060
 Closing the loop part, got it.

18:42.060 --> 18:46.940
 It feels like the mutation part is not that difficult.

18:46.940 --> 18:48.140
 It feels like the difficult part

18:48.140 --> 18:50.900
 is just creating a copy of yourself as step one.

18:50.900 --> 18:55.900
 That seems like one of the greatest inventions

18:56.220 --> 19:00.580
 in the history of the universe is the first molecule

19:00.580 --> 19:04.660
 that figured out, holy shit, I can create a copy of myself.

19:04.660 --> 19:06.980
 How hard is that?

19:06.980 --> 19:09.780
 I think it's really, really easy.

19:09.780 --> 19:11.020
 Okay, I did not expect that.

19:11.020 --> 19:12.660
 I think it's really, really easy.

19:12.660 --> 19:15.180
 Well, let's take a step back.

19:15.180 --> 19:19.260
 I think replicating molecules are rare,

19:19.260 --> 19:22.060
 but if you say, I think I was saying on,

19:22.060 --> 19:23.900
 I probably got into trouble on Twitter the other day,

19:23.900 --> 19:24.940
 so I was trying to work this.

19:24.940 --> 19:27.180
 There's about more than 18 mils of water in there.

19:27.180 --> 19:31.700
 So one mole of water, 6.022 times 10 to the 23 molecules.

19:31.700 --> 19:33.940
 That's about the number of stars in universe, I think,

19:33.940 --> 19:34.780
 of the order.

19:34.780 --> 19:37.140
 So there's three universe worth, but between one and.

19:37.140 --> 19:38.460
 Somebody corrected you on Twitter?

19:38.460 --> 19:40.860
 Yeah, as if, I'm always being corrected.

19:40.860 --> 19:44.100
 It's a great, but there's a lot of molecules in the water.

19:44.100 --> 19:47.700
 And so there's a lot of, so although it's for you and me,

19:47.700 --> 19:49.540
 really hard to conceive of,

19:49.540 --> 19:54.540
 if existence is not the default for a long period of time,

19:55.220 --> 19:57.820
 because what happens is the molecules get degraded.

19:57.820 --> 20:00.060
 So much of the possibilities in the universe

20:00.060 --> 20:01.860
 are just broken back into atoms.

20:01.860 --> 20:06.020
 So you have this kind of destruction of the molecules

20:06.020 --> 20:07.700
 for our chemical reactions.

20:07.700 --> 20:09.980
 So you only need one or two molecules

20:09.980 --> 20:12.260
 to become good at copying themselves

20:12.260 --> 20:15.060
 for them suddenly to then take resources in the pool

20:15.060 --> 20:16.380
 and start to grow.

20:16.380 --> 20:18.940
 And so then replication actually over time,

20:18.940 --> 20:23.020
 when you have bonds, I think is much simpler, much easier.

20:23.020 --> 20:25.540
 And I even found this in my lab years ago.

20:25.540 --> 20:29.460
 I had one of the reasons I started doing inorganic chemistry

20:29.460 --> 20:32.500
 and making rust, making a bit of rust based on

20:32.500 --> 20:35.020
 a thing called molybdenum, molybdenum oxide

20:35.020 --> 20:38.620
 is this molybdenum oxide, very simple.

20:38.620 --> 20:40.940
 But when you add acid to it and some electrons,

20:40.940 --> 20:44.700
 they make these molecules you just cannot possibly imagine

20:44.700 --> 20:46.980
 would be constructed big, gigantic wheels

20:46.980 --> 20:50.180
 of 154 molybdenum atoms in a wheel

20:50.180 --> 20:54.380
 or I cost a dodecahedron 132 molybdenum atoms

20:54.380 --> 20:55.460
 all in the same pot.

20:55.460 --> 20:56.940
 And I realized when I,

20:56.940 --> 20:58.780
 and I just finished experiments two years ago,

20:58.780 --> 21:00.940
 I've just published a couple of papers on this,

21:00.940 --> 21:05.100
 that they're actually, there is a random small molecule

21:05.100 --> 21:07.860
 with 12 atoms in it that can form randomly,

21:07.860 --> 21:10.860
 but it happens to template its own production.

21:10.860 --> 21:14.060
 And then by chance, it templates the ring,

21:14.060 --> 21:17.300
 just an accident, just like just an absolute accident.

21:17.300 --> 21:21.980
 And that ring also helps make the small 12 mer.

21:21.980 --> 21:25.500
 And so you have what's called an autocatalytic set

21:25.500 --> 21:30.500
 where A makes B and B helps make A and vice versa.

21:32.860 --> 21:34.580
 And you then make this loop.

21:34.580 --> 21:39.580
 So it's a bit like these, they all work in synergy

21:39.580 --> 21:43.500
 to make this chain of events that grow.

21:43.500 --> 21:46.620
 And it doesn't take a very sophisticated model

21:46.620 --> 21:50.540
 to show that if you have these objects are competing

21:50.540 --> 21:53.300
 and then collaborating to help one another build,

21:53.300 --> 21:55.020
 they just grow out of the mess.

21:55.020 --> 21:56.980
 And although they seem improbable,

21:56.980 --> 22:01.580
 they are improbable, in fact, impossible in one step.

22:01.580 --> 22:02.820
 There's multiple steps.

22:02.820 --> 22:04.300
 This is when the blind people look

22:04.300 --> 22:06.660
 at the blind watchmaker argument

22:06.660 --> 22:10.820
 and you talk about how could a watch spontaneously emerge?

22:10.820 --> 22:11.740
 Well, it doesn't.

22:11.740 --> 22:14.500
 It's a lineage of watches and cruder devices

22:14.500 --> 22:17.820
 that are bootstrapped onto one another.

22:19.140 --> 22:23.220
 Right, so it's very improbable,

22:23.220 --> 22:25.380
 but once you get that little discovery

22:25.380 --> 22:29.540
 like with the wheel and fire,

22:29.540 --> 22:34.540
 it just explodes because it's so successful, it explodes.

22:34.540 --> 22:37.780
 It explodes, it's basically selection.

22:37.780 --> 22:40.500
 So this templating mechanism that allows you

22:40.500 --> 22:43.460
 to have a little like blueprint for yourself,

22:43.460 --> 22:45.100
 how you go through different procedures

22:45.100 --> 22:46.620
 is to build copies of yourself.

22:49.500 --> 22:52.940
 So in chemistry somehow it's possible to imagine

22:52.940 --> 22:57.020
 that that kind of thing is easy to spring up.

22:57.020 --> 22:59.820
 In more complex organisms, it feels like a different thing

22:59.820 --> 23:00.860
 and much more complicated.

23:00.860 --> 23:04.340
 Like we're having like multiple abstractions

23:04.340 --> 23:06.820
 of the birds and the bees conversation here,

23:06.820 --> 23:10.220
 but with human, I'm sorry, with complex organisms,

23:10.220 --> 23:14.220
 it feels like difficult to have reproduction to,

23:15.940 --> 23:17.140
 that's gonna get clipped out.

23:17.140 --> 23:18.540
 I'm gonna make fun of that.

23:18.540 --> 23:23.540
 It's difficult to develop this idea

23:23.860 --> 23:25.820
 of making copies of yourself or no.

23:26.860 --> 23:30.260
 Because that seems like a magical idea for life to,

23:30.260 --> 23:35.260
 but wow, that feels like very necessary

23:35.500 --> 23:37.700
 for what selection is, for what evolution is.

23:37.700 --> 23:40.620
 But then if selection precedes all of this,

23:40.620 --> 23:43.420
 then maybe these are just like echoes

23:43.420 --> 23:47.340
 of the selecting mechanism at different scales.

23:47.340 --> 23:48.420
 Yeah, that's exactly it.

23:48.420 --> 23:52.020
 So selection is the default in the universe if you want to.

23:52.020 --> 23:54.780
 And what happens is that life,

23:54.780 --> 23:57.660
 the solution that life has got on earth,

23:57.660 --> 24:01.300
 life on earth, biology on earth is unique to earth.

24:01.300 --> 24:03.220
 We can talk about that.

24:03.220 --> 24:05.740
 And that was really hard fought for,

24:05.740 --> 24:08.660
 but that is a solution that works on earth,

24:08.660 --> 24:10.620
 the ribosome, the fundamental machine

24:10.620 --> 24:15.180
 that is responsible for every cell on earth

24:15.180 --> 24:18.500
 of whatever, wherever it is in the kingdom of life.

24:18.500 --> 24:21.180
 That is an incredibly complex object,

24:21.180 --> 24:22.900
 but it was evolved over time

24:22.900 --> 24:24.620
 and it wasn't involved in a vacuum.

24:24.620 --> 24:27.980
 And I think that once we understand that selection

24:27.980 --> 24:32.700
 can occur without the ribosome,

24:32.700 --> 24:34.180
 but what the ribosome does,

24:34.180 --> 24:37.220
 it's a phase transition in replication.

24:37.220 --> 24:39.100
 And I think that that, and also technology

24:39.100 --> 24:44.100
 that is probably much easier to get to than we think.

24:45.780 --> 24:50.780
 Why do you put the ribosome as a central part

24:50.820 --> 24:52.380
 of living organisms on earth?

24:52.380 --> 24:53.700
 It basically is a combination

24:53.700 --> 24:57.260
 of two different polymer systems, so RNA and peptides.

24:57.260 --> 24:59.500
 So the RNA world, if you like,

24:59.500 --> 25:02.420
 gets transmitted and builds proteins

25:02.420 --> 25:05.220
 and the proteins are responsible for all the catalysis.

25:05.220 --> 25:07.300
 The majority of the catalysis goes on in the cell.

25:07.300 --> 25:11.460
 No ribosome, no proteins, no decoding, no evolution.

25:11.460 --> 25:14.340
 So ribosome is looking at the action.

25:14.340 --> 25:17.780
 You don't put like the RNA itself as the critical thing,

25:17.780 --> 25:20.780
 like information, you put action as the most important thing.

25:20.780 --> 25:22.420
 I think the actual molecules

25:22.420 --> 25:24.780
 that we have in biology right now are entirely contingent

25:24.780 --> 25:27.340
 on the history of life on earth.

25:27.340 --> 25:29.020
 There are so many possible solutions.

25:29.020 --> 25:31.140
 And this is where chemistry got itself into,

25:31.140 --> 25:33.460
 origin of life chemistry gets itself into a bit of a trap.

25:33.460 --> 25:35.260
 Yeah, let me interrupt you there.

25:35.260 --> 25:36.580
 You've tweeted, you're gonna get,

25:36.580 --> 25:40.520
 I'm gonna cite your tweets like it's Shakespeare, okay?

25:40.520 --> 25:43.740
 It's surprising you haven't gotten canceled on Twitter yet.

25:43.740 --> 25:45.640
 Your brilliance once again saves you.

25:46.660 --> 25:47.500
 I'm just kidding.

25:49.020 --> 25:51.300
 You like to have a little bit of fun on Twitter.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.780
 You've tweeted that quote,

25:52.780 --> 25:56.020
 origin of life research is a scam.

25:56.860 --> 26:00.180
 So if this is Shakespeare, can we analyze this word?

26:00.180 --> 26:02.300
 Why is the origin of life research a scam?

26:02.300 --> 26:05.240
 Aren't you kind of doing origin of life research?

26:06.760 --> 26:08.180
 Okay, it was tongue in cheek, but yeah,

26:08.180 --> 26:10.540
 I think, and I meant it as tongue in cheek.

26:12.460 --> 26:14.460
 I'm not doing the origin of life research.

26:14.460 --> 26:16.820
 I'm trying to make artificial life.

26:16.820 --> 26:19.700
 And I also want to bound the likelihood

26:19.700 --> 26:21.340
 of the origin of life on earth,

26:21.340 --> 26:23.820
 but more importantly to find origin of life elsewhere.

26:23.820 --> 26:26.020
 But let me directly address the tweet.

26:26.020 --> 26:27.920
 There are many, many good chemists out there

26:27.920 --> 26:31.500
 doing origin of life research, but I want to nudge them.

26:31.500 --> 26:32.340
 And I think they're brilliant.

26:32.340 --> 26:36.620
 Like there's no question the chemistry they are doing,

26:36.620 --> 26:38.780
 the motivation is great.

26:38.780 --> 26:40.580
 So what I meant by that tweet is saying

26:40.580 --> 26:43.000
 that maybe they're making assumptions about saying,

26:43.000 --> 26:47.440
 if only I could make this particular type of molecule,

26:47.440 --> 26:52.100
 say this RNA molecule or this phosphodiester

26:52.100 --> 26:54.140
 or this other molecule,

26:54.140 --> 26:57.820
 it's gonna somehow unlock the origin of life.

26:57.820 --> 27:00.580
 And I think that origin of life has been looking at this

27:00.580 --> 27:01.980
 for a very long time.

27:01.980 --> 27:05.700
 And whilst I think it's brilliant to work out

27:05.700 --> 27:08.220
 how you can get to those molecules,

27:08.220 --> 27:11.420
 I think that chemistry and chemists doing origin of life

27:11.420 --> 27:15.940
 could be nudged into doing something even more profound.

27:15.940 --> 27:18.460
 And so the argument I'm making,

27:18.460 --> 27:20.260
 it's a bit like right now,

27:20.260 --> 27:22.940
 let's say, I don't know, the first Tesla

27:22.940 --> 27:25.820
 that makes its way to, I don't know,

27:25.820 --> 27:27.060
 into a new country in the world.

27:27.060 --> 27:29.660
 Let's say there's a country X

27:29.660 --> 27:31.180
 that has never had a Tesla before

27:31.180 --> 27:32.100
 and they get the Tesla.

27:32.100 --> 27:32.940
 Russia.

27:32.940 --> 27:34.260
 And they take the Tesla,

27:34.260 --> 27:35.660
 and what they do is they take the Tesla apart

27:35.660 --> 27:38.420
 and say, we want to find the origin of cars in the universe

27:38.420 --> 27:41.140
 and say, okay, how did this form and how did this form?

27:41.140 --> 27:42.620
 And they just randomly keep making

27:42.620 --> 27:44.360
 till they make the door, they make the wheel,

27:44.360 --> 27:46.220
 they make the steering column and all this stuff.

27:46.220 --> 27:48.140
 And they say, well, that's the route.

27:48.140 --> 27:50.440
 That's the way cars emerged on earth.

27:50.440 --> 27:53.340
 But actually we know that there's a causal chain of cars

27:53.340 --> 27:56.100
 going right back to Henry Ford and the horse and carriage.

27:56.100 --> 27:57.740
 And before that, maybe, you know,

27:58.820 --> 28:00.340
 where people were using wheels.

28:00.340 --> 28:04.340
 And I think that obsession with the identities

28:04.340 --> 28:06.140
 that we see in biology right now

28:06.140 --> 28:09.260
 are giving us a false sense of security

28:09.260 --> 28:10.960
 about what we're looking for.

28:10.960 --> 28:15.960
 And I think that origin of life chemistry is in danger

28:17.000 --> 28:20.740
 of not making the progress that it deserves

28:20.740 --> 28:22.780
 because the chemists are doing this.

28:22.780 --> 28:24.260
 The field is exploding right now.

28:24.260 --> 28:27.540
 There's amazing people out there, young and old doing this.

28:27.540 --> 28:30.340
 And there's deservedly so more money going in.

28:30.340 --> 28:31.860
 You know, I used to complain

28:31.860 --> 28:34.100
 there's more money being spent searching for the Higgs boson

28:34.100 --> 28:36.300
 that we know exists than the origin of life.

28:36.300 --> 28:37.460
 You know, why is that?

28:37.460 --> 28:39.780
 The origin, we understand the origin of life.

28:39.780 --> 28:42.000
 We're gonna actually work out what life is.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.180
 And we're gonna be at a bound,

28:43.180 --> 28:45.680
 the likelihood of finding life elsewhere in the universe.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.020
 And most important for us,

28:47.020 --> 28:49.500
 we are gonna know or have a good idea

28:49.500 --> 28:51.700
 of what the future of humanity looks like.

28:51.700 --> 28:53.420
 You know, we need to understand

28:53.420 --> 28:54.960
 that although we're precious,

28:54.960 --> 28:57.140
 we're not the only life forms in the universe.

28:57.140 --> 28:58.700
 Or that's my very strong impression.

28:58.700 --> 29:00.100
 I have no data for that.

29:00.100 --> 29:02.180
 It's just right now a belief.

29:02.180 --> 29:03.380
 And I want to turn that belief

29:03.380 --> 29:07.180
 into a more than a belief by experimentation.

29:07.180 --> 29:09.480
 But coming back to the scam,

29:09.480 --> 29:11.660
 the scam is if we just make this RNA,

29:11.660 --> 29:16.660
 we've got this fluke event, we know how that's simple.

29:17.540 --> 29:19.180
 Let's make this phosphodiester,

29:19.180 --> 29:21.220
 or let's make ATP or ADP.

29:21.220 --> 29:22.420
 We've got that part nailed.

29:22.420 --> 29:24.420
 Let's now make this other molecule, another molecule.

29:24.420 --> 29:26.460
 And how many molecules are gonna be enough?

29:26.460 --> 29:28.380
 And then the reason I say this

29:28.380 --> 29:30.580
 is when you go back to Craig Venter,

29:30.580 --> 29:34.440
 when he invented his life form, Cyndia,

29:35.340 --> 29:38.180
 this micro, this minimal plasmid,

29:38.180 --> 29:43.180
 it's a myoplasma, something, I don't know the name of it,

29:43.180 --> 29:45.580
 but he made this wonderful cell

29:45.580 --> 29:48.360
 and said, I've invented life.

29:48.360 --> 29:49.220
 Not quite.

29:49.220 --> 29:52.700
 He facsimileed the genome from this entity

29:52.700 --> 29:55.660
 and made it in the lab, all the DNA,

29:55.660 --> 29:56.940
 but he didn't make the cell.

29:56.940 --> 30:00.000
 He had to take an existing cell

30:00.000 --> 30:02.680
 that has a causal chain going all the way back to Luca.

30:02.680 --> 30:05.320
 And he showed when he took out the gene,

30:05.320 --> 30:08.260
 the genes and put in his genes, synthesized,

30:08.260 --> 30:09.840
 the cell could boot up.

30:09.840 --> 30:11.940
 But it's remarkable that he could not make a cell

30:11.940 --> 30:12.900
 from scratch.

30:12.900 --> 30:15.120
 And even now today, synthetic biologists

30:15.120 --> 30:17.300
 cannot make a cell from scratch

30:17.300 --> 30:20.920
 because there's some contingent information embodied

30:20.920 --> 30:23.780
 outside the genome in the cell.

30:23.780 --> 30:26.140
 And that is just incredible.

30:26.140 --> 30:28.120
 So there's lots of layers to the scam.

30:29.940 --> 30:32.940
 Well, let me then ask the question,

30:32.940 --> 30:37.200
 how can we create life in the lab from scratch?

30:37.200 --> 30:39.420
 What have been the most promising attempts

30:39.420 --> 30:41.860
 at creating life in the lab from scratch?

30:41.860 --> 30:44.220
 Has anyone actually been able to do it?

30:44.220 --> 30:46.340
 Do you think anyone will be able to do it

30:46.340 --> 30:48.500
 in the near future if they haven't already?

30:50.420 --> 30:53.660
 Yeah, I think that nobody has made life

30:53.660 --> 30:54.740
 in the lab from scratch.

30:54.740 --> 30:57.380
 Lots of people would argue that they have made progress.

30:57.380 --> 30:59.300
 So Craig Venter, I think the synthesis

30:59.300 --> 31:03.580
 of a synthetic genome milestone in human achievement.

31:03.580 --> 31:04.420
 Brilliant.

31:04.420 --> 31:06.340
 Yeah, can we just walk back and say,

31:06.340 --> 31:09.740
 what would you say from your perspective,

31:09.740 --> 31:12.960
 one of the world experts in exactly this area,

31:12.960 --> 31:15.100
 what does it mean to create life from scratch

31:15.100 --> 31:17.260
 where if you sit back, whether you do it

31:17.260 --> 31:19.180
 or somebody else does it, it's like,

31:20.040 --> 31:24.580
 damn, this is, we just created life.

31:24.580 --> 31:27.580
 Well, I can tell you what I would expect,

31:27.580 --> 31:30.220
 I would like to be able to do,

31:30.220 --> 31:35.220
 is to go from sand to cells in my lab and...

31:37.540 --> 31:39.060
 Can you explain what sand is?

31:39.060 --> 31:42.780
 Yeah, just inorganic stuff, like basically just,

31:42.780 --> 31:47.220
 so sand is just silicon oxide with some other ions in it,

31:47.220 --> 31:50.980
 maybe some inorganic carbon, some carbonates,

31:50.980 --> 31:52.980
 just basically clearly dead stuff

31:52.980 --> 31:55.580
 that you could just grind rocks into sand.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.940
 And it would be what, in a kind of vacuum

31:57.940 --> 31:59.580
 so they could remove anything else

31:59.580 --> 32:04.580
 that could possibly be like a shadow of life

32:05.220 --> 32:06.340
 that can assist in the chemical.

32:06.340 --> 32:07.940
 You could do that, you could insist and say,

32:07.940 --> 32:09.940
 look, I'm gonna take, and not just inorganic,

32:09.940 --> 32:12.580
 I want some more, I wanna cheat and have some organic,

32:12.580 --> 32:13.900
 but I want inorganic organic,

32:13.900 --> 32:16.100
 and I'll explain the play on words in a moment.

32:16.100 --> 32:19.420
 So I would like to basically put into a world,

32:19.420 --> 32:23.220
 let's say a completely synthetic world, if you like,

32:23.220 --> 32:26.700
 a closed world, put some inorganic materials

32:26.700 --> 32:30.020
 and just literally add some energy in some form,

32:30.020 --> 32:33.660
 be it lightning or heat, UV light,

32:33.660 --> 32:37.180
 and run this thing in cycles over time

32:37.180 --> 32:38.620
 and let it solve the search problem.

32:38.620 --> 32:41.140
 So I see the origin of life as a search problem

32:41.140 --> 32:42.700
 in chemical space.

32:42.700 --> 32:45.580
 And then I would wait, literally wait for a life form

32:45.580 --> 32:46.580
 to crawl out of the test tube.

32:46.580 --> 32:48.100
 That's a joke I tell my group.

32:48.100 --> 32:51.620
 Literally wait for a very, don't worry,

32:51.620 --> 32:52.540
 it's gonna be very feeble,

32:52.540 --> 32:54.700
 it's not gonna take over the world.

32:54.700 --> 32:56.020
 There's ways of ethically containing it.

32:56.020 --> 32:57.180
 Famous last words.

32:58.220 --> 33:01.380
 Indeed, indeed, indeed, but I.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.220
 You know this is being recorded, right?

33:03.220 --> 33:05.660
 It'll make you, it will not make you look good

33:05.660 --> 33:07.620
 once it crawls out of the lab

33:07.620 --> 33:09.940
 and destroys all of human civilization, but yes.

33:09.940 --> 33:11.060
 But there is very good,

33:11.060 --> 33:13.460
 there is a very good things you can do to prevent that.

33:13.460 --> 33:15.580
 For instance, if you put stuff in your world,

33:15.580 --> 33:17.460
 which isn't earth abundant,

33:17.460 --> 33:20.420
 so let's say we make life based on molybdenum

33:20.420 --> 33:21.940
 and it escapes, it would die immediately

33:21.940 --> 33:23.460
 because there's not enough molybdenum in the environment.

33:23.460 --> 33:26.700
 So we can put in, we can do responsible life.

33:26.700 --> 33:29.900
 Or as I fantasize with my research group on our away day

33:29.900 --> 33:31.500
 that would go in, it's, you know,

33:31.500 --> 33:36.060
 I think it's actually morally if we don't find,

33:36.060 --> 33:38.020
 until humanity finds life in the universe,

33:38.020 --> 33:39.260
 this is going on a tangent,

33:39.260 --> 33:42.020
 it's our moral obligation to make origin of life bombs,

33:42.020 --> 33:43.820
 identify dead planets and bomb them

33:43.820 --> 33:46.580
 with our origin of life machines and make them alive.

33:46.580 --> 33:49.180
 I think it is our moral obligation to do that.

33:50.260 --> 33:51.780
 Some people might argue with me about that,

33:51.780 --> 33:54.420
 but I think that we need more life in the universe.

33:54.420 --> 33:58.140
 And then we kind of forget we did it

33:58.140 --> 34:00.860
 and then come back and then.

34:00.860 --> 34:02.260
 So where did you come from?

34:02.260 --> 34:04.020
 But coming back to the, what I'd expect.

34:04.020 --> 34:06.820
 So I just say. Father, are you back?

34:06.820 --> 34:09.220
 I think this is once again, a Rick and Morty episode.

34:09.220 --> 34:11.940
 It's definitely all Rick and Morty all the way down.

34:11.940 --> 34:15.540
 So we, I imagine we have this pristine experiment

34:15.540 --> 34:18.100
 and everything is, you know, sanitized

34:18.100 --> 34:20.060
 and we put in inorganic materials

34:20.060 --> 34:22.220
 and we have cycles with them,

34:22.220 --> 34:24.500
 day, night cycles, up, down, whatever.

34:24.500 --> 34:27.260
 And we look for evidence of replication

34:27.260 --> 34:28.660
 and evolution over time.

34:28.660 --> 34:30.580
 And that's what the experiment should be.

34:30.580 --> 34:32.460
 Now, are there people doing this in the world right now?

34:32.460 --> 34:33.780
 There are a couple of,

34:33.780 --> 34:35.780
 there's some really good groups doing this.

34:35.780 --> 34:37.180
 There's some really interesting scientists

34:37.180 --> 34:38.740
 doing this around the world.

34:38.740 --> 34:43.740
 They're kind of perhaps too much associated with the scam.

34:44.540 --> 34:48.500
 So, and so they're using molecules

34:48.500 --> 34:50.860
 that are already, were already invented by biology.

34:50.860 --> 34:54.100
 So there's a bit of replication built in,

34:54.100 --> 34:55.780
 but I still think the work that is doing,

34:55.780 --> 34:57.660
 they're doing is amazing.

34:57.660 --> 35:00.180
 But I would like people to be a bit freer and say,

35:00.180 --> 35:03.500
 let's just basically shake a load of sand in a box

35:03.500 --> 35:04.580
 and wait for life to come out

35:04.580 --> 35:06.300
 because that's what happened on earth.

35:06.300 --> 35:08.020
 And so that we have to understand that.

35:08.020 --> 35:10.140
 Now, how would I know I've been successful?

35:10.140 --> 35:11.900
 Well, because I'm not obsessing

35:11.900 --> 35:15.060
 with what molecules are in life now,

35:15.060 --> 35:19.820
 I would wager a vast quantity of money.

35:19.820 --> 35:21.900
 I'm not very rich, so just be a few dollars,

35:21.900 --> 35:26.900
 but for me, the solution space will be different.

35:27.180 --> 35:31.020
 So the genetic material will be not RNA.

35:31.020 --> 35:33.580
 The proteins will not be what we think.

35:33.580 --> 35:36.140
 The solutions will be just completely different.

35:36.140 --> 35:37.740
 And it might be, and it will be very feeble

35:37.740 --> 35:40.860
 because that's the other thing we should be able to show

35:40.860 --> 35:43.780
 fairly robustly that even if I did make

35:43.780 --> 35:46.060
 or someone did make a new life form in the lab,

35:46.060 --> 35:50.020
 it would be so poor that it's not gonna leap out.

35:50.020 --> 35:55.020
 It is the fear about making a lethal life form

35:56.020 --> 36:00.620
 in the lab from scratch is similar to us imagining

36:00.620 --> 36:02.500
 that we're gonna make the terminator

36:02.500 --> 36:04.460
 at Boston Dynamics tomorrow.

36:04.460 --> 36:07.140
 Simply not, and the problem is

36:07.140 --> 36:08.420
 we don't communicate that properly.

36:08.420 --> 36:12.820
 I know you yourself very, you explain this very well.

36:12.820 --> 36:14.940
 There is not the AI catastrophe coming.

36:15.980 --> 36:16.940
 We're very far away from that.

36:16.940 --> 36:18.380
 That doesn't mean we should ignore it.

36:18.380 --> 36:19.980
 Same with the origin of life catastrophe.

36:19.980 --> 36:21.860
 It's not coming anytime soon.

36:21.860 --> 36:24.820
 We shouldn't ignore it, but we shouldn't let that fear

36:24.820 --> 36:26.500
 stop us from doing those experiments.

36:26.500 --> 36:28.460
 But this is a much, much longer discussion

36:28.460 --> 36:29.820
 because there's a lot of details there.

36:29.820 --> 36:32.700
 I would say there is potential for catastrophic events

36:33.580 --> 36:36.980
 to happen in much dumber ways.

36:36.980 --> 36:40.020
 In AI space, there's a lot of ways to create,

36:40.020 --> 36:43.140
 like social networks are creating a kind

36:43.140 --> 36:46.300
 of accelerated set of events

36:46.300 --> 36:48.340
 that we might not be able to control.

36:48.340 --> 36:53.260
 The social network virality in the digital space

36:53.260 --> 36:58.260
 can create mass movements of ideas that can then,

36:58.820 --> 37:01.980
 if times are tough, create military conflict

37:01.980 --> 37:02.980
 and all those kinds of things.

37:02.980 --> 37:05.660
 But that's not super intelligent AI.

37:05.660 --> 37:09.740
 That's an interesting at scale application of AI.

37:09.740 --> 37:13.300
 If you look at viruses, viruses are pretty dumb,

37:13.300 --> 37:16.780
 but at scale, their application is pretty detrimental.

37:16.780 --> 37:21.780
 And so origin of life, much like all the kind of virology,

37:25.220 --> 37:28.540
 the very contentious word of gain of function research

37:28.540 --> 37:31.740
 and virology, sort of like research on viruses,

37:33.420 --> 37:36.100
 messing with them genetically,

37:36.100 --> 37:38.980
 that can create a lot of problems if not done well.

37:38.980 --> 37:41.820
 So we have to be very cautious.

37:41.820 --> 37:43.260
 So there's a kind of,

37:43.260 --> 37:47.100
 whenever you're ultra cautious about stuff in AI

37:47.100 --> 37:50.740
 or in virology and biology,

37:50.740 --> 37:53.420
 it borders on cynicism, I would say,

37:53.420 --> 37:56.740
 where it's like everything we do is going to turn out

37:56.740 --> 37:58.660
 to be destructive and terrible.

37:58.660 --> 38:00.980
 So I'm just going to sit here and do nothing.

38:00.980 --> 38:04.660
 Okay, that's a possible solution except for the fact

38:04.660 --> 38:06.380
 that somebody is going to do it.

38:06.380 --> 38:10.500
 It's science and technology progresses.

38:10.500 --> 38:14.780
 So we have to do it in an ethical way, in a good way,

38:14.780 --> 38:17.820
 considering in a transparent way, in an open way,

38:18.980 --> 38:23.780
 considering all the possible positive trajectories

38:23.780 --> 38:26.380
 that could be taken and making sure as much as possible

38:26.380 --> 38:28.260
 that we walk those trajectories.

38:28.260 --> 38:31.100
 So yeah, I don't think Terminator is coming,

38:31.100 --> 38:35.220
 but a totally unexpected version of Terminator

38:35.220 --> 38:36.500
 may be around the corner.

38:36.500 --> 38:37.340
 Might be here already.

38:37.340 --> 38:38.980
 Yeah, so I agree with that.

38:38.980 --> 38:41.460
 And so going back to the origin of life discussion,

38:41.460 --> 38:44.500
 I think that in synthetic biology right now,

38:44.500 --> 38:49.060
 we have to be very careful about how we edit genomes

38:49.060 --> 38:51.460
 and edit synthetic biology to do things.

38:51.460 --> 38:53.900
 So that's kind of, that's where things might go wrong

38:53.900 --> 38:56.300
 in the same way as Twitter turning ourselves

38:56.300 --> 38:59.460
 into kind of strange scale effects.

38:59.460 --> 39:01.780
 I would love origin of life research

39:01.780 --> 39:04.580
 or artificial life research to get to the point

39:04.580 --> 39:06.820
 where we have those worries,

39:06.820 --> 39:08.820
 because that's why I think we're just so far away from that.

39:08.820 --> 39:10.700
 We are just, you know, right now,

39:10.700 --> 39:13.100
 I think there are two really important angles.

39:13.100 --> 39:15.860
 There is the origin of life people,

39:15.860 --> 39:18.780
 researchers who are faithfully working on this

39:18.780 --> 39:20.540
 and trying to make those molecules,

39:20.540 --> 39:22.740
 the scan molecules I talked about.

39:22.740 --> 39:24.860
 And then there are people on the creationist side

39:24.860 --> 39:25.700
 who are saying, look,

39:25.700 --> 39:26.940
 the fact you can't make these molecules

39:26.940 --> 39:29.940
 and you can't make a cell means that evolution isn't true

39:29.940 --> 39:30.780
 and all this other stuff.

39:30.780 --> 39:31.620
 Gotcha.

39:31.620 --> 39:34.180
 Yeah, and so, and I find that really frustrating

39:34.180 --> 39:35.900
 because actually the origin of life research

39:35.900 --> 39:37.820
 is all working in good faith, right?

39:37.820 --> 39:38.660
 Yes.

39:38.660 --> 39:40.100
 And so what I'm trying to do

39:40.100 --> 39:41.860
 is give origin of life research

39:41.860 --> 39:46.860
 a little bit more of an open context.

39:47.180 --> 39:49.420
 And one of the things I think is important,

39:49.420 --> 39:52.300
 I really want to make a new life form in my lifetime.

39:52.300 --> 39:56.060
 I really want to prove that life is a general phenomena,

39:56.060 --> 39:58.140
 a bit like gravity in the universe,

39:58.140 --> 39:59.940
 because I think that's gonna be really important

39:59.940 --> 40:04.900
 for humanity's global psychological state,

40:04.900 --> 40:06.300
 meaning going forward.

40:06.300 --> 40:09.100
 That's beautifully put.

40:09.100 --> 40:12.500
 So one, it will help us understand ourselves.

40:12.500 --> 40:14.220
 So that's useful for science,

40:14.220 --> 40:17.660
 but two, it gives us a kind of hope,

40:17.660 --> 40:22.660
 if not an awe at all the huge amounts

40:23.980 --> 40:26.380
 of alien civilizations that are out there.

40:26.380 --> 40:29.140
 If you can build life and understand

40:29.140 --> 40:31.900
 just how easy it is to build life,

40:31.900 --> 40:35.540
 then that's just as good, if not much better,

40:35.540 --> 40:38.300
 than discovering life on another planet.

40:38.300 --> 40:39.140
 Yeah.

40:39.140 --> 40:41.620
 It's, I mean, it's cheaper.

40:41.620 --> 40:44.460
 It's much cheaper and much easier

40:44.460 --> 40:47.460
 and probably much more conclusive

40:47.460 --> 40:50.020
 because once you're able to create life,

40:50.020 --> 40:52.260
 like you said, it's a search problem

40:52.260 --> 40:55.740
 that there's probably a lot of different ways to do it.

40:55.740 --> 40:58.940
 Once you create the, once you find the first solution,

40:58.940 --> 41:00.620
 you probably have all the right methodology

41:00.620 --> 41:02.660
 for finding all kinds of other solutions.

41:02.660 --> 41:03.740
 Yeah, and wouldn't it be great

41:03.740 --> 41:04.860
 if we could find a solution?

41:04.860 --> 41:07.580
 I mean, it's probably a bit late for,

41:07.580 --> 41:09.060
 I mean, I worry about climate change,

41:09.060 --> 41:10.660
 but I'm not that worried about climate change,

41:10.660 --> 41:13.420
 and I think one day you could think about,

41:13.420 --> 41:15.140
 could we engineer a new type of life form

41:15.140 --> 41:17.900
 that could basically, and I don't want to do this,

41:17.900 --> 41:19.460
 and I don't think we should do this necessarily,

41:19.460 --> 41:21.180
 but it's a good thought experiment

41:21.180 --> 41:23.620
 that would perhaps take CO2 out of the atmosphere

41:23.620 --> 41:26.060
 or an intermediate life form, so it's not quite alive.

41:26.060 --> 41:28.180
 It's almost like an add on

41:28.180 --> 41:32.180
 that we can, with a time dependent add on,

41:32.180 --> 41:35.060
 you could give to say cyanobacteria in the ocean

41:35.060 --> 41:37.460
 or to maybe to wheat and say, right,

41:37.460 --> 41:40.300
 we're just gonna, we're gonna fix a bit more CO2,

41:40.300 --> 41:42.020
 and we're gonna work out how much we need to fix

41:42.020 --> 41:44.580
 to basically save the climate,

41:44.580 --> 41:47.620
 and we're gonna use evolutionary principles

41:47.620 --> 41:49.500
 to basically get there.

41:49.500 --> 41:51.900
 What worries me is that biology has had a few billion years

41:51.900 --> 41:54.300
 to find a solution for CO2 fixation,

41:54.300 --> 41:57.060
 hasn't really done, it's not,

41:57.060 --> 41:58.900
 the solution isn't brilliant for our needs,

41:58.900 --> 42:00.780
 but biology wasn't thinking about our needs.

42:00.780 --> 42:03.180
 Biology was thinking about biology's needs,

42:03.180 --> 42:05.180
 but I think if we can do, as you say,

42:05.180 --> 42:08.460
 make life in the lab, then suddenly we don't need

42:08.460 --> 42:10.940
 to go to everywhere and conclusively prove it.

42:10.940 --> 42:12.420
 I think we make life in the lab.

42:12.420 --> 42:14.300
 We look at the extent of life in the solar system.

42:14.300 --> 42:16.460
 How far did Earth life get?

42:16.460 --> 42:17.780
 Probably we're all Martians.

42:17.780 --> 42:19.260
 Probably life got going on Mars.

42:19.260 --> 42:21.220
 The chemistry on Mars seeded Earth.

42:21.220 --> 42:22.940
 That might have been a legitimate way

42:22.940 --> 42:25.540
 to kind of truncate the surface.

42:25.540 --> 42:26.580
 But in the outer solar system,

42:26.580 --> 42:28.340
 we might have completely different life forms

42:28.340 --> 42:32.060
 on Enceladus, on Europa, and Titan.

42:32.060 --> 42:33.380
 And that would be a cool thing, because.

42:33.380 --> 42:36.380
 Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

42:36.380 --> 42:40.340
 Did you just say that you think, in terms of likelihood,

42:40.340 --> 42:43.620
 life started on Mars, like statistically speaking,

42:43.620 --> 42:45.860
 life started on Mars and seeded Earth?

42:45.860 --> 42:48.380
 It could be possible, because life was,

42:48.380 --> 42:50.980
 so Mars was habitable for the type of life

42:50.980 --> 42:53.900
 that we have right now, type of chemistry before Earth.

42:53.900 --> 42:57.020
 So it seems to me that Mars got searching,

42:57.020 --> 42:59.580
 doing chemistry, like, and.

42:59.580 --> 43:00.820
 It started way before.

43:00.820 --> 43:03.060
 Yeah, and so they had a few more replicators

43:03.060 --> 43:04.220
 and some other stuff.

43:04.220 --> 43:06.340
 And if those replicators got ejected from Mars

43:06.340 --> 43:09.220
 and landed on Earth, and Earth was like,

43:09.220 --> 43:10.340
 I don't need to start again.

43:10.340 --> 43:11.580
 Right.

43:11.580 --> 43:12.420
 Thanks for that.

43:12.420 --> 43:13.300
 And then it just carried on.

43:13.300 --> 43:16.540
 So I'm not going, I think we will find evidence

43:16.540 --> 43:20.060
 of life on Mars, either life we put there by mistake,

43:20.060 --> 43:22.220
 contamination, or actually life,

43:22.220 --> 43:24.500
 the earliest remnants of life.

43:24.500 --> 43:26.020
 And that would be really exciting.

43:26.020 --> 43:28.100
 It's a really good reason to go there.

43:28.100 --> 43:29.580
 But I think it's more unlikely,

43:29.580 --> 43:31.620
 because the gravitational situation in the solar system,

43:31.620 --> 43:33.660
 if we find life in the outer solar system.

43:33.660 --> 43:35.860
 Titan and all that, that would be its own thing.

43:35.860 --> 43:36.700
 Exactly.

43:36.700 --> 43:37.940
 Wow, that would be so cool.

43:37.940 --> 43:40.820
 If we go to Mars and we find life that looks

43:40.820 --> 43:43.020
 a hell of a lot similar to Earth life,

43:43.020 --> 43:46.780
 and then we go to Titan and all those weird moons

43:46.780 --> 43:49.060
 with the ices and the volcanoes and all that kind of stuff,

43:49.060 --> 43:52.500
 and then we find there something that looks,

43:52.500 --> 43:54.860
 I don't know, way weirder.

43:54.860 --> 43:55.700
 Yeah.

43:55.700 --> 43:57.660
 Some other, some non RNA type of situation.

43:57.660 --> 43:59.580
 But we might find almost life,

43:59.580 --> 44:01.900
 like in the prebiotic chemical space.

44:01.900 --> 44:03.660
 And I think there are four types of exoplanets

44:03.660 --> 44:04.540
 we need to look for, right?

44:04.540 --> 44:07.220
 Because when JWST goes up and touch wood,

44:07.220 --> 44:09.140
 it goes up and everything's fine.

44:09.140 --> 44:12.020
 When we look at a star, well, we know statistically,

44:12.020 --> 44:13.420
 most stars have planets around them.

44:13.420 --> 44:14.680
 What type of planet are they?

44:14.680 --> 44:16.380
 Are they going to be dead?

44:16.380 --> 44:20.620
 Are they going to be just a prebiotic origin of life coming?

44:20.620 --> 44:22.580
 So are they going to be technological?

44:23.460 --> 44:27.260
 So with intelligence on them, and will they have died?

44:27.260 --> 44:30.580
 So, you know, had life on them, but gone.

44:30.580 --> 44:32.220
 Those are the four states of the boat.

44:32.220 --> 44:34.940
 And suddenly, it's a bit like I want to classify planets

44:34.940 --> 44:36.980
 the way we classify stars.

44:36.980 --> 44:37.820
 Yeah.

44:37.820 --> 44:39.660
 And I think that, in terms of their,

44:39.660 --> 44:42.700
 rather than having this, oh, we've found methane,

44:42.700 --> 44:43.540
 there's evidence of life.

44:43.540 --> 44:45.300
 We found oxygen, that's the evidence of life.

44:45.300 --> 44:47.900
 We found whatever molecule marker.

44:47.900 --> 44:51.620
 And start to then frame things a little bit more.

44:51.620 --> 44:52.980
 As those four states.

44:52.980 --> 44:53.820
 Yeah.

44:53.820 --> 44:55.140
 Which, by the way, you're just saying four,

44:55.140 --> 44:58.760
 but there could be, before the dead,

44:58.760 --> 45:00.100
 there could be other states

45:00.100 --> 45:01.780
 that we humans can even conceive of.

45:01.780 --> 45:04.580
 Yeah, yeah, just prebiotic, almost alive,

45:04.580 --> 45:06.300
 got the possibility to come alive.

45:06.300 --> 45:07.140
 I think.

45:07.140 --> 45:08.780
 But there could be a post technological.

45:08.780 --> 45:12.060
 Like, whatever we think of as technology,

45:12.060 --> 45:16.860
 that could be a, like, pre conscious,

45:17.860 --> 45:20.980
 like, where we all meld into one super intelligent conscious,

45:20.980 --> 45:23.860
 or some weird thing that naturally happens over time.

45:23.860 --> 45:24.700
 Yeah, yeah.

45:24.700 --> 45:26.740
 I mean, I think that all bets are on that.

45:26.740 --> 45:28.100
 The metaverse.

45:28.100 --> 45:29.740
 Yeah, we are.

45:29.740 --> 45:33.940
 We join into a virtual metaverse and start creating,

45:33.940 --> 45:35.380
 which is kind of an interesting idea,

45:35.380 --> 45:38.480
 almost arbitrary number of copies of each other,

45:38.480 --> 45:41.940
 much more quickly, so we can mess with different ideas.

45:41.940 --> 45:45.420
 Like, I can create a thousand copies of Lex,

45:45.420 --> 45:48.060
 like, every possible version of Lex,

45:48.060 --> 45:49.620
 and then just see, like,

45:49.620 --> 45:52.300
 and then I just have them, like, argue with each other,

45:52.300 --> 45:54.860
 and, like, until, like, in the space of ideas

45:54.860 --> 45:56.340
 and see who wins out.

45:56.340 --> 45:58.060
 How could that possibly go wrong?

45:58.060 --> 46:01.620
 But anyway, there's, especially in this digital space

46:01.620 --> 46:04.520
 where you could start exploring with AIs mixed in,

46:04.520 --> 46:07.460
 you could start engineering arbitrary intelligences,

46:07.460 --> 46:10.100
 you can start playing in the space of ideas,

46:10.100 --> 46:13.900
 which might move us into a world that looks very different

46:13.900 --> 46:15.020
 than a biological world.

46:15.020 --> 46:17.600
 Like, our current world, the technology,

46:17.600 --> 46:20.960
 is still very much tied to our biology.

46:20.960 --> 46:23.540
 It's, we might move past that completely.

46:23.540 --> 46:25.260
 Oh, definitely, we definitely will.

46:25.260 --> 46:27.340
 We definitely, but that could be another phase then.

46:27.340 --> 46:28.180
 Sure.

46:28.180 --> 46:29.000
 Because then you, yeah.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.780
 But I did say technological, so I think I agree with you.

46:30.780 --> 46:32.540
 I think, so you can have, let's get this right.

46:32.540 --> 46:36.500
 So, dead world, no prospect of alive.

46:36.500 --> 46:38.920
 Prebiotic world, life emerging.

46:38.920 --> 46:40.900
 Living and technological.

46:40.900 --> 46:42.180
 And you probably, and the dead one,

46:42.180 --> 46:43.060
 you probably won't be able to tell

46:43.060 --> 46:46.020
 between the dead never being alive and the dead one,

46:46.020 --> 46:48.000
 maybe you've got some artifacts and maybe there's five.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.400
 There's probably not more than five.

46:50.400 --> 46:53.060
 And I think the technological one could allow,

46:53.060 --> 46:54.300
 could have life on it still,

46:54.300 --> 46:56.340
 but it might just have exceeded.

46:56.340 --> 46:58.820
 Because, you know, one way that life might survive on Earth

46:58.820 --> 47:01.780
 is if we can work out how to deal with the coming,

47:01.780 --> 47:05.480
 the real climate change that comes when the sun expands.

47:05.480 --> 47:10.420
 It might be a way to survive that, you know, but yeah.

47:10.420 --> 47:12.420
 I think that we need to start thinking statistically

47:12.420 --> 47:15.240
 when it comes to looking for life in the universe.

47:15.240 --> 47:20.240
 Let me ask you then, sort of statistically,

47:20.660 --> 47:23.860
 how many alien civilizations are out there

47:23.860 --> 47:26.500
 in those four phases that you're talking about?

47:26.500 --> 47:28.580
 When you look up to the stars

47:28.580 --> 47:30.820
 and you're sipping on some wine

47:30.820 --> 47:35.340
 and talking to other people with British accents

47:35.340 --> 47:38.140
 about something intelligent and intellectual, I'm sure.

47:39.860 --> 47:42.740
 Do you think there's a lot of alien civilizations

47:42.740 --> 47:45.700
 looking back at us and wondering the same?

47:45.700 --> 47:48.540
 My romantic view of the universe

47:48.540 --> 47:52.240
 is really taking loans from my logical self.

47:52.240 --> 47:55.500
 So what I'm saying is I have no doubt, I have no idea.

47:55.500 --> 48:00.500
 But having said that, there is no reason to suppose

48:01.520 --> 48:04.820
 that life is as hard as we first thought it was.

48:04.820 --> 48:08.780
 And so if we just take Earth as a marker,

48:08.780 --> 48:12.220
 and if I think that life is a much more general phenomena

48:12.220 --> 48:13.300
 than just our biology,

48:13.300 --> 48:16.700
 then I think the universe is full of life.

48:16.700 --> 48:18.860
 And the reason for the Fermi paradox

48:18.860 --> 48:22.220
 is not that they're not out there,

48:22.220 --> 48:24.960
 it's just that we can't interact with the other life forms

48:24.960 --> 48:27.020
 because they're so different.

48:27.020 --> 48:28.980
 And I'm not saying that they're necessarily like

48:28.980 --> 48:31.780
 hasn't depicted in Arrival or other, you know,

48:31.780 --> 48:35.320
 I'm just saying that perhaps

48:36.760 --> 48:40.120
 there are very few universal facts in the universe

48:40.120 --> 48:45.120
 and maybe our technologies are quite divergent.

48:47.440 --> 48:49.760
 And so I think that it's very hard to know

48:49.760 --> 48:51.640
 how we're gonna interact with alien life.

48:51.640 --> 48:54.120
 You think there's a lot of kinds of life that's possible.

48:54.120 --> 48:57.360
 I guess that was the intuition you provided

48:57.360 --> 49:02.360
 that the way biology itself,

49:02.400 --> 49:04.680
 but even this particular kinds of biology

49:04.680 --> 49:09.680
 that we have on Earth is something that is just one sample

49:11.560 --> 49:15.560
 of nearly infinite number of other possible,

49:15.560 --> 49:19.320
 complex, autonomous, self replicating type of things

49:19.320 --> 49:20.680
 that could be possible.

49:20.680 --> 49:24.320
 And so we're almost unable to see

49:24.320 --> 49:28.480
 the alternative versions of us, huh?

49:28.480 --> 49:31.840
 I mean, we'll still be able to detect them,

49:31.840 --> 49:33.840
 we'll still be able to interact with them,

49:33.840 --> 49:36.840
 we'll still be able to like which,

49:36.840 --> 49:39.260
 what's exactly is lost in translation?

49:39.260 --> 49:41.280
 Why can't we see them?

49:41.280 --> 49:42.720
 Why can't we talk to them?

49:42.720 --> 49:46.100
 Because I too have a sense,

49:47.840 --> 49:49.760
 you put it way more poetically,

49:49.760 --> 49:54.760
 but it seems both statistically

49:54.880 --> 49:58.600
 and sort of romantically,

49:58.600 --> 50:02.040
 it feels like the universe should be teeming with life,

50:02.040 --> 50:04.460
 like super intelligent life.

50:04.460 --> 50:09.460
 And I just, I sit there and the Fermi paradox is very,

50:10.840 --> 50:12.880
 it's felt very distinctly by me

50:12.880 --> 50:15.720
 when I look up at the stars because it's like,

50:15.720 --> 50:18.480
 it's the same way I feel when I'm driving

50:18.480 --> 50:20.560
 through New Jersey and listening to Bruce Springsteen

50:20.560 --> 50:23.160
 and feel quite sad.

50:23.160 --> 50:25.040
 It's like Lucy Kay talks about pulling off

50:25.040 --> 50:27.700
 to the side of the road and just weeping a little bit.

50:27.700 --> 50:31.180
 I'm almost like wondering like,

50:31.180 --> 50:33.800
 hey, why aren't you talking to us?

50:33.800 --> 50:35.600
 It feels lonely, it feels lonely

50:35.600 --> 50:38.240
 because it feels like they're out there.

50:38.240 --> 50:40.120
 I think that there are a number of answers to that.

50:40.120 --> 50:42.520
 I think the Fermi paradox is perhaps based

50:42.520 --> 50:47.240
 on the assumption that if life did emerge in the universe,

50:47.240 --> 50:49.160
 it would be similar to our life

50:49.160 --> 50:50.920
 and there's only one solution.

50:50.920 --> 50:52.800
 And I think that what we've got to start to do

50:52.800 --> 50:56.120
 is go out and look for selection detection

50:56.120 --> 50:58.320
 rather than an evolution detection,

50:58.320 --> 50:59.960
 rather than life detection.

51:01.380 --> 51:03.440
 And I think that once we start to do that,

51:03.440 --> 51:07.000
 we might start to see really interesting things.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.200
 And we haven't been doing this for very long

51:10.200 --> 51:12.640
 and we are living in an expanding universe

51:12.640 --> 51:15.680
 and that makes the problem a little bit harder.

51:15.680 --> 51:19.820
 Everybody's always leaving distance wise.

51:19.820 --> 51:22.880
 I'm very optimistic that we will,

51:22.880 --> 51:25.800
 well, I don't know, there are two movies that came out

51:25.800 --> 51:27.720
 within six months of one another,

51:27.720 --> 51:30.200
 Ad Astra and Cosmos.

51:30.200 --> 51:32.880
 Ad Astra, the very expensive blockbuster

51:32.880 --> 51:35.880
 with Brad Pitt in it and saying there is no life

51:35.880 --> 51:37.220
 and it's all, we've got to,

51:37.220 --> 51:39.080
 life on Earth has more pressures than Cosmos,

51:39.080 --> 51:40.360
 which is a UK production,

51:40.360 --> 51:42.920
 which basically aliens came and visited Earth one day

51:42.920 --> 51:45.120
 and they were discovered in the UK, right?

51:45.120 --> 51:47.440
 It was quite, it's a fun film.

51:48.440 --> 51:50.420
 But I really loved those two films.

51:50.420 --> 51:53.560
 And at the same time, those films,

51:53.560 --> 51:54.760
 at the time those films were coming out,

51:54.760 --> 51:58.520
 I was working on a paper, a life detection paper,

51:58.520 --> 52:02.020
 and I found it was so hard to publish this paper

52:02.020 --> 52:03.680
 and it was almost as depressed,

52:03.680 --> 52:06.500
 I got so depressed trying to get this science out there

52:06.500 --> 52:11.320
 that I felt the depression of the film in Ad Astra,

52:11.320 --> 52:14.720
 like life, there's no life elsewhere in the universe.

52:14.720 --> 52:17.400
 And, but I'm incredibly optimistic

52:17.400 --> 52:19.320
 that I think we will find life in the universe,

52:19.320 --> 52:21.040
 firm evidence of life,

52:21.040 --> 52:22.440
 and it will have to start on Earth,

52:22.440 --> 52:24.360
 making life on Earth and surprising us.

52:24.360 --> 52:25.680
 We have to surprise ourselves

52:25.680 --> 52:28.440
 and make non biological life on Earth.

52:28.440 --> 52:31.400
 And then people say, well, you made this life on Earth,

52:31.400 --> 52:34.380
 therefore it's, you're part of the causal chain of that.

52:34.380 --> 52:35.600
 And that might be true,

52:35.600 --> 52:38.920
 but if I can show how I'm able to do it

52:38.920 --> 52:40.800
 with very little cheating

52:40.800 --> 52:42.380
 or very little information inputs,

52:42.380 --> 52:44.660
 just creating like a model planet.

52:44.660 --> 52:48.520
 Some description and watching it, watching life emerge,

52:48.520 --> 52:51.140
 then I think that we will be even to persuade

52:51.140 --> 52:55.080
 even the hardest critic that it's possible.

52:55.080 --> 52:57.660
 Now, with regards to the Fermi paradox,

52:57.660 --> 53:01.400
 I think that we might crush that with the JWST.

53:01.400 --> 53:03.120
 It's basically, if I recall correctly,

53:03.120 --> 53:06.440
 the mirror is about 10 times the size of the Hubble

53:06.440 --> 53:09.020
 that we're gonna be able to do spectroscopy,

53:09.020 --> 53:12.680
 look at colors of exoplanets, I think, not brilliantly,

53:12.680 --> 53:15.280
 but we'll be able to start to classify them.

53:15.280 --> 53:18.860
 And we'll start to get a real feel

53:18.860 --> 53:21.400
 for what's going on in the universe on these exoplanets.

53:21.400 --> 53:25.200
 Cause it's only in the last few decades, I think,

53:25.200 --> 53:27.600
 maybe even last decade that we even

53:30.320 --> 53:33.880
 came to recognize that exoplanets even are common.

53:33.880 --> 53:36.160
 And I think that that gives us a lot of optimism

53:36.160 --> 53:38.660
 that life is gonna be out there.

53:38.660 --> 53:40.560
 But I think we have to start framing,

53:40.560 --> 53:44.040
 we have to start preparing the fact

53:44.040 --> 53:46.920
 that biology is only one solution.

53:46.920 --> 53:50.640
 I can tell you with confidence that biology on Earth

53:50.640 --> 53:52.620
 does not exist anywhere else in the universe.

53:52.620 --> 53:54.680
 We are absolutely unique.

53:54.680 --> 53:56.840
 Well, okay, I love the confidence,

53:56.840 --> 54:01.840
 but where does that confidence come from?

54:02.400 --> 54:07.400
 Chemistry, like how many options does chemistry really have?

54:07.640 --> 54:08.880
 Many, that's the point.

54:08.880 --> 54:11.160
 And the thing is, this is where the origin of life scam

54:11.160 --> 54:15.140
 comes in, is that people don't quite count,

54:15.140 --> 54:16.240
 they don't count the numbers.

54:16.240 --> 54:19.980
 So if biology as you find on Earth is common everywhere,

54:19.980 --> 54:21.600
 then there's something really weird going on

54:21.600 --> 54:23.940
 that basically written in the quantum mechanics,

54:23.940 --> 54:26.680
 there's some kind of these bonds must form over these bonds

54:26.680 --> 54:28.280
 and this catalyst must form over this catalyst

54:28.280 --> 54:30.160
 when they're all quite equal.

54:30.160 --> 54:31.840
 Life is contingent.

54:31.840 --> 54:34.560
 The origin of life on Earth was contingent

54:34.560 --> 54:38.600
 upon the chemistry available at the origin of life on Earth.

54:38.600 --> 54:43.360
 So that means if we want to find other Earth like worlds,

54:43.360 --> 54:45.120
 we look for the same kind of rocky world.

54:45.120 --> 54:47.840
 We might look in the same zone as Earth

54:47.840 --> 54:50.320
 and we might expect reasonably

54:50.320 --> 54:53.840
 to find biological like stuff going on.

54:53.840 --> 54:55.540
 That would be a reasonable hypothesis,

54:55.540 --> 54:57.360
 but it won't be the same, it can't be.

54:57.360 --> 55:00.480
 It's like saying, I don't believe in magic.

55:00.480 --> 55:02.520
 That's why I'm sure.

55:02.520 --> 55:03.680
 I just don't believe in magic.

55:03.680 --> 55:06.000
 I believe in statistics and I can do experiments.

55:06.000 --> 55:09.680
 And so I won't get the same, exactly the same sequence

55:09.680 --> 55:11.440
 of events, I'll get something different.

55:11.440 --> 55:14.400
 And so there is TikTok elsewhere in the universe,

55:14.400 --> 55:16.600
 but it's not the same as our TikTok, right?

55:16.600 --> 55:17.840
 That's what I mean.

55:17.840 --> 55:20.160
 Which aspect of it is not the same?

55:20.160 --> 55:23.480
 Well, I just think, so what is TikTok?

55:23.480 --> 55:27.040
 TikTok is a social media where people upload videos, right?

55:27.040 --> 55:28.100
 Of silly videos.

55:28.100 --> 55:29.440
 So I guess there might be.

55:29.440 --> 55:31.000
 Well, there's humor, there's attention,

55:31.000 --> 55:33.080
 there's the ability to process,

55:33.080 --> 55:35.480
 there's ability for intelligent organisms

55:35.480 --> 55:38.640
 to collaborate on ideas and find human ideas

55:38.640 --> 55:41.900
 and play with those ideas, make them viral, memes.

55:43.760 --> 55:45.400
 Humor seems to be kind of fundamental

55:45.400 --> 55:46.600
 to the human experience.

55:46.600 --> 55:48.820
 And I think that that's a really interesting question

55:48.820 --> 55:52.360
 we can ask, is humor a fundamental thing in the universe?

55:52.360 --> 55:53.640
 I think maybe it will be, right?

55:53.640 --> 55:56.800
 In terms of, you think about in a game theoretic sense,

55:56.800 --> 56:00.440
 humor, the emergence of humor serves a role

56:00.440 --> 56:01.640
 in our game engine.

56:01.640 --> 56:05.000
 And so if selection is fundamental in the universe,

56:05.000 --> 56:05.840
 so is humor.

56:06.920 --> 56:10.280
 Well, I actually don't know exactly

56:10.280 --> 56:12.520
 what role humor serves.

56:12.520 --> 56:15.320
 Maybe it's like, from a chemical perspective,

56:15.320 --> 56:19.280
 it's like a catalyst for,

56:20.320 --> 56:21.480
 I guess it's for several purposes.

56:21.480 --> 56:23.720
 One is the catalyst for spreading ideas on the internet.

56:23.720 --> 56:25.480
 That's modern humor.

56:25.480 --> 56:28.220
 But humor is also a good way to deal

56:28.220 --> 56:30.800
 with the difficulty of life.

56:30.800 --> 56:35.560
 It's a kind of valve, release valve for suffering.

56:35.560 --> 56:39.080
 Throughout human history, life has been really hard.

56:39.080 --> 56:41.200
 And for the people that I've known in my life

56:41.200 --> 56:44.780
 who've lived through some really difficult things,

56:44.780 --> 56:47.400
 humor is part of how they deal with that.

56:47.400 --> 56:49.320
 It's usually dark humor.

56:49.320 --> 56:51.480
 But yeah, it's interesting.

56:51.480 --> 56:56.040
 I don't know exactly what's the more mathematically

56:56.040 --> 56:58.840
 general way to formulate what the hell is humor.

56:58.840 --> 57:01.040
 What humor does it serve?

57:01.040 --> 57:03.800
 But I still, we're kind of joking here,

57:03.800 --> 57:08.800
 but it's a counterintuitive idea to me

57:09.800 --> 57:14.640
 to think that life elsewhere in the universe

57:14.640 --> 57:17.440
 is very different than life on Earth.

57:17.440 --> 57:22.440
 And also, like all of each instantiation of life

57:23.400 --> 57:26.000
 is likely very different from each other.

57:26.000 --> 57:30.480
 Yeah, like maybe there's a few clusters of similar life,

57:30.480 --> 57:34.160
 but it's much more likely is what you're saying.

57:34.160 --> 57:36.180
 To me, it's a kind of novel thought.

57:36.180 --> 57:37.520
 I'm not sure what to do with it.

57:37.520 --> 57:40.360
 But you're saying that it's more common

57:40.360 --> 57:44.860
 to be a weird outcast in the full spectrum of life

57:44.860 --> 57:48.140
 than it is to be in some usual cluster.

57:48.140 --> 57:51.520
 So every instantiation of a kind of chemistry

57:51.520 --> 57:53.440
 that results in complexity that's autonomous

57:53.440 --> 57:56.880
 and self replicating however the hell you define life,

57:56.880 --> 57:59.700
 that is going to be very different every time.

57:59.700 --> 58:00.540
 I don't know.

58:01.400 --> 58:04.960
 It feels like a selection is a fundamental

58:04.960 --> 58:07.940
 kind of directed force in the universe.

58:07.940 --> 58:11.520
 Won't selection result in a few pockets

58:11.520 --> 58:13.440
 of interesting complexities?

58:13.440 --> 58:18.440
 I mean, yeah, if we ran Earth over again,

58:19.960 --> 58:20.880
 over and over and over,

58:20.880 --> 58:23.080
 you're saying it's going to come up with,

58:23.080 --> 58:26.000
 there's not going to be elephants every time?

58:26.000 --> 58:27.480
 Yeah, I don't think so.

58:27.480 --> 58:30.520
 I think that there will be similarities.

58:30.520 --> 58:32.260
 And I think we don't know enough

58:32.260 --> 58:36.520
 about how selection globally works.

58:37.880 --> 58:42.080
 But it might be that the emergence of elephants

58:42.080 --> 58:44.400
 was wired into the history of Earth in some way,

58:44.400 --> 58:47.920
 like the gravitational force, how evolution was going,

58:47.920 --> 58:49.360
 Cambrian explosions, blah, blah, blah,

58:49.360 --> 58:50.760
 the emergence of mammals.

58:50.760 --> 58:53.720
 But I just don't know enough about the contingency,

58:53.720 --> 58:54.920
 the variability.

58:54.920 --> 58:57.260
 All I do know is you count the number of bits

58:57.260 --> 59:00.600
 of information required to make an elephant

59:00.600 --> 59:03.600
 and think about the causal chain

59:03.600 --> 59:05.700
 that provide the lineage of elephants

59:05.700 --> 59:07.760
 going all the way back to Luca,

59:07.760 --> 59:10.360
 there's a huge scope for divergence.

59:10.360 --> 59:15.040
 Yeah, but just like you said, with chemistry and selection,

59:15.040 --> 59:20.040
 the things that result in self replicating chemistry

59:22.840 --> 59:24.880
 and self replicating organisms,

59:26.520 --> 59:29.360
 those are extremely unlikely, as you're saying.

59:30.520 --> 59:33.100
 But once they're successful, they multiply.

59:33.100 --> 59:37.640
 So it might be a tiny subset of all things

59:37.640 --> 59:40.080
 that are possible in the universe, chemically speaking,

59:40.080 --> 59:41.800
 it might be a very tiny subset

59:41.800 --> 59:44.600
 is actually successful at creating elephants.

59:44.600 --> 59:48.040
 Or elephant like or slash human like creatures.

59:48.040 --> 59:48.880
 Well, there's two different questions here.

59:48.880 --> 59:52.920
 The first one, if we were to reset Earth and to start again.

59:52.920 --> 59:54.920
 The different phases, sorry to keep interrupting.

59:54.920 --> 59:56.880
 Yeah, no, if we restart Earth and start again,

59:56.880 --> 59:58.600
 say we could go back to the beginning

59:58.600 --> 1:00:00.920
 and do the experiment or have a number of Earths,

1:00:00.920 --> 1:00:02.600
 how similar would biology be?

1:00:02.600 --> 1:00:06.420
 I would say that there would be broad similarities,

1:00:06.420 --> 1:00:09.120
 but the emergence of mammals is not a given

1:00:09.120 --> 1:00:11.520
 unless we're gonna throw an asteroid at each planet

1:00:11.520 --> 1:00:15.760
 at each time and try and faithfully reproduce what happened.

1:00:15.760 --> 1:00:17.960
 Then there's the other thing about

1:00:17.960 --> 1:00:20.440
 when you go to another Earth like planet elsewhere,

1:00:20.440 --> 1:00:22.920
 maybe there's a different ratio, particular elements,

1:00:22.920 --> 1:00:27.240
 maybe the bombardment at the beginning of the planet

1:00:27.240 --> 1:00:30.440
 was quicker or longer than Earth.

1:00:30.440 --> 1:00:32.800
 And I just don't have enough information there.

1:00:32.800 --> 1:00:37.800
 What I do know is that the complexity of the story of life

1:00:37.800 --> 1:00:42.280
 on Earth gives us lots of scope for variation.

1:00:42.280 --> 1:00:44.540
 And I just don't think it's a reasonable

1:00:44.540 --> 1:00:48.960
 mathematical assumption to think that life on Earth

1:00:48.960 --> 1:00:51.560
 that happened again would be same as what we have now.

1:00:51.560 --> 1:00:54.520
 Okay, but you've also extended that to say

1:00:54.520 --> 1:00:58.440
 that we might, as an explanation for the Fermi paradox,

1:00:58.440 --> 1:01:02.680
 that that means we're not able to interact with them.

1:01:02.680 --> 1:01:06.680
 Or that's an explanation for why we haven't at scale

1:01:06.680 --> 1:01:10.520
 heard from aliens is they're different than us.

1:01:10.520 --> 1:01:13.480
 We've only been looking for, say, 70, 80 years.

1:01:13.480 --> 1:01:17.440
 So I think that the reason we have not found aliens yet

1:01:17.440 --> 1:01:20.000
 is that we haven't worked out what life is.

1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:23.980
 No, but the aliens have worked that out, surely.

1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:29.360
 Statistically speaking, there must be a large number

1:01:29.360 --> 1:01:31.800
 of aliens that are way ahead of us

1:01:31.800 --> 1:01:33.520
 on this whole life question.

1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:37.320
 Unless there's something about this stage

1:01:37.320 --> 1:01:40.900
 of intellectual evolution that often quickly results

1:01:40.900 --> 1:01:42.560
 in nuclear war and destroys itself.

1:01:42.560 --> 1:01:47.560
 Like there's something in this process

1:01:48.120 --> 1:01:52.440
 that eventually, I don't know, crystallizes the complexity

1:01:52.440 --> 1:01:55.800
 and it stops, either dies or stops developing.

1:01:55.800 --> 1:01:58.140
 But most likely, they already figured it out.

1:01:58.140 --> 1:01:59.840
 And why aren't they contacting us?

1:01:59.840 --> 1:02:03.320
 Is it some grad student somewhere?

1:02:03.320 --> 1:02:06.520
 Wants to study a new green planet?

1:02:06.520 --> 1:02:07.840
 Maybe they have.

1:02:07.840 --> 1:02:12.160
 I mean, I don't have a coherent answer to your question,

1:02:12.160 --> 1:02:15.480
 other than to say that if there are other aliens out there

1:02:15.480 --> 1:02:17.600
 and they're far more advanced,

1:02:17.600 --> 1:02:19.920
 they might be in contact with each other.

1:02:19.920 --> 1:02:22.480
 And they might also, we might be at a point

1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:24.640
 where what I'm saying quite critically

1:02:24.640 --> 1:02:26.840
 is it takes two to talk, right?

1:02:26.840 --> 1:02:28.080
 So the aliens might be there.

1:02:28.080 --> 1:02:31.220
 But if we don't have the ability to recognize them

1:02:31.220 --> 1:02:33.680
 and talk to them, then the aliens aren't going

1:02:33.680 --> 1:02:36.080
 to want to talk to us.

1:02:36.080 --> 1:02:37.560
 And I think that's a critical point

1:02:37.560 --> 1:02:42.180
 that probably if that's a filter,

1:02:42.180 --> 1:02:44.440
 there needs to be an ability for one

1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:45.760
 to communicate with the other.

1:02:45.760 --> 1:02:48.240
 And we need to know what life is before we do that.

1:02:48.240 --> 1:02:50.880
 So we haven't qualified to even join the club

1:02:50.880 --> 1:02:51.840
 to have a talk.

1:02:51.840 --> 1:02:54.840
 Well, I think they still wanna teach us how to talk, right?

1:02:54.840 --> 1:02:59.840
 But my worry is that, or I think they would wanna teach us

1:02:59.840 --> 1:03:02.240
 how to talk like you do when you meet it.

1:03:04.360 --> 1:03:07.960
 Like when you even meet, I was gonna say child,

1:03:07.960 --> 1:03:09.720
 but that's a human species.

1:03:09.720 --> 1:03:11.360
 I mean like ant.

1:03:12.620 --> 1:03:15.640
 You want to try to communicate with them

1:03:15.640 --> 1:03:17.400
 through whatever devices you can,

1:03:17.400 --> 1:03:19.360
 given what an ant is like.

1:03:19.360 --> 1:03:21.880
 I just, I worry mostly about that humans

1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:25.020
 are just too close minded or don't have the right tools.

1:03:25.020 --> 1:03:27.200
 No, I'm gonna push back on this quite significantly.

1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:30.640
 I would say, because we don't understand what life is

1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:32.400
 and because we don't understand

1:03:32.400 --> 1:03:34.200
 how life emerged in the universe,

1:03:34.200 --> 1:03:36.080
 we don't understand the physics

1:03:36.080 --> 1:03:38.040
 that gave rise to life yet.

1:03:38.040 --> 1:03:40.640
 That means our fundamental description,

1:03:40.640 --> 1:03:43.320
 I'm way out of my pay grade, even further out.

1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:44.160
 But I'll say it anyway,

1:03:44.160 --> 1:03:44.980
 because I think it's a fun.

1:03:44.980 --> 1:03:47.320
 You don't get paid much anyway, as you said earlier.

1:03:47.320 --> 1:03:50.960
 So I would say that we,

1:03:50.960 --> 1:03:52.920
 because we don't understand the universe yet,

1:03:52.920 --> 1:03:56.040
 we do not understand how the universe spat out life.

1:03:56.040 --> 1:03:57.640
 And we don't know what life is.

1:03:57.640 --> 1:03:59.760
 And I think that until we understand that,

1:03:59.760 --> 1:04:01.960
 it is gonna limit our ability to even,

1:04:02.840 --> 1:04:05.880
 we don't qualify to talk to the aliens.

1:04:05.880 --> 1:04:08.440
 So I'm gonna say that they might be there,

1:04:08.440 --> 1:04:10.560
 but we just, I'm not gonna say that I believe

1:04:10.560 --> 1:04:12.440
 in interdimensional aliens being present in this room.

1:04:12.440 --> 1:04:14.800
 Yeah, but I think you're just being self critical,

1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:15.840
 like we don't qualify.

1:04:15.840 --> 1:04:19.320
 I think the fact that we don't qualify qualifies us.

1:04:19.320 --> 1:04:22.040
 We're interesting in our innocence.

1:04:22.040 --> 1:04:25.720
 No, I'm saying that because we don't understand

1:04:25.720 --> 1:04:27.720
 causal chains and the way that information

1:04:27.720 --> 1:04:29.320
 is propagated in the universe.

1:04:29.320 --> 1:04:31.160
 And we don't understand what replication is yet.

1:04:31.160 --> 1:04:35.120
 And we don't understand how life emerged.

1:04:35.120 --> 1:04:38.720
 I think that we would not recognize aliens.

1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:42.140
 And if someone doesn't recognize you,

1:04:43.200 --> 1:04:44.320
 you wouldn't go and talk to it.

1:04:44.320 --> 1:04:46.680
 You don't go and talk to ants.

1:04:46.680 --> 1:04:48.240
 You don't go and talk to birds

1:04:48.240 --> 1:04:49.760
 or maybe some birds you do, right?

1:04:49.760 --> 1:04:52.160
 Cause you can, there's just enough cognition.

1:04:52.160 --> 1:04:55.080
 So I'm saying because we don't have enough,

1:04:55.080 --> 1:04:58.720
 our cognitive abilities are not yet where they need to be.

1:04:58.720 --> 1:05:00.200
 We probably haven't been communicating with them.

1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:02.880
 So you don't agree with the dating strategy

1:05:02.880 --> 1:05:04.640
 of playing hard to get?

1:05:04.640 --> 1:05:07.400
 Cause us humans, that seems to attract us.

1:05:07.400 --> 1:05:09.240
 Within a species, that's fine.

1:05:09.240 --> 1:05:11.660
 But I think we don't actually have abstraction.

1:05:11.660 --> 1:05:15.600
 No, actually I think in this talk, in this conversation,

1:05:15.600 --> 1:05:16.920
 you've helped me crystallize something

1:05:16.920 --> 1:05:19.240
 that I think has been troubling me for a long time

1:05:19.240 --> 1:05:20.160
 with the thermi paradox.

1:05:20.160 --> 1:05:23.840
 I'm pretty sure that a reasonable avenue

1:05:23.840 --> 1:05:28.480
 is to say that you would not go and talk to your cat

1:05:28.480 --> 1:05:31.160
 about calculus, right?

1:05:31.160 --> 1:05:32.280
 But I would still pet it.

1:05:32.280 --> 1:05:34.280
 Sure, but I'm not talking about petting a cat.

1:05:34.280 --> 1:05:37.160
 The analogy is that the aliens are not going to talk to us

1:05:37.160 --> 1:05:40.020
 because we, and I'm using calculus as analogy

1:05:40.020 --> 1:05:44.280
 for abstraction because we lack the layer,

1:05:44.280 --> 1:05:47.400
 the fundamental layer of understanding what life is

1:05:47.400 --> 1:05:50.280
 and what the universe is in our reality

1:05:50.280 --> 1:05:52.840
 that it would be so counterproductive

1:05:52.840 --> 1:05:55.280
 interacting with intelligent alien species

1:05:55.280 --> 1:05:58.860
 that it would cause more angst for human race.

1:05:59.720 --> 1:06:00.780
 They don't care.

1:06:00.780 --> 1:06:03.060
 Okay, they gotta be self interested.

1:06:03.060 --> 1:06:05.240
 So they'll probably, they more care about

1:06:05.240 --> 1:06:06.880
 is it interesting for them?

1:06:06.880 --> 1:06:10.680
 Maybe they, I mean, surely there's a way

1:06:10.680 --> 1:06:15.680
 to pet the cat in this analogy

1:06:16.920 --> 1:06:20.840
 because even if we lack complete understanding,

1:06:20.840 --> 1:06:23.160
 it must be a very frustrating experience

1:06:23.160 --> 1:06:26.760
 for other kinds of intelligence to communicate with us.

1:06:26.760 --> 1:06:29.640
 Still, there must be a way to interact with us.

1:06:29.640 --> 1:06:30.480
 Well.

1:06:30.480 --> 1:06:34.280
 Like perturb the system in interesting ways

1:06:34.280 --> 1:06:35.820
 to see what these creatures do.

1:06:35.820 --> 1:06:37.440
 We might actually find the answer.

1:06:37.440 --> 1:06:39.280
 I mean, again, out of my pay grade,

1:06:39.280 --> 1:06:42.560
 in a simulation of the Earth,

1:06:42.560 --> 1:06:44.900
 let's say a simulation where we allow

1:06:44.900 --> 1:06:47.160
 an intelligent AI to emerge, right?

1:06:47.160 --> 1:06:52.160
 And that AI, we then give it the objective

1:06:52.440 --> 1:06:54.980
 is to be curious, interact with other intelligence

1:06:54.980 --> 1:06:56.200
 in its universe.

1:06:56.200 --> 1:07:00.900
 And then we might find the parameters required

1:07:00.900 --> 1:07:02.420
 for that AI to walk with.

1:07:02.420 --> 1:07:05.320
 And I think you'll find if the AI will not talk

1:07:05.320 --> 1:07:08.780
 to other AIs that don't share the ability

1:07:08.780 --> 1:07:10.400
 to abstract at the level of the AI

1:07:10.400 --> 1:07:13.280
 because it's just a cat and are you gonna travel

1:07:13.280 --> 1:07:15.320
 20 light years to go and pet a cat?

1:07:15.320 --> 1:07:19.200
 So not because of the inability to do so,

1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:20.840
 but because of like boredom.

1:07:20.840 --> 1:07:23.920
 It's more interested, it will start talking to,

1:07:23.920 --> 1:07:28.040
 it will spend most, it will spend a majority

1:07:28.040 --> 1:07:30.280
 of its time talking to other AI systems

1:07:30.280 --> 1:07:32.360
 that can at least somewhat understand

1:07:32.360 --> 1:07:33.200
 and it's much more fun.

1:07:33.200 --> 1:07:34.960
 It's a bit like, do we know that plants are conscious?

1:07:34.960 --> 1:07:36.960
 Well, plants are unconscious in the way we typically think,

1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:37.800
 but we don't talk to them.

1:07:37.800 --> 1:07:38.640
 They could be, right?

1:07:38.640 --> 1:07:40.080
 Yeah, but there's a lot of people on Earth

1:07:40.080 --> 1:07:41.120
 who like gardening.

1:07:41.120 --> 1:07:42.800
 There's always going to be a weird.

1:07:42.800 --> 1:07:44.160
 They're not talking, they're just gardening.

1:07:44.160 --> 1:07:46.240
 Okay, well, you're not romantic enough

1:07:46.240 --> 1:07:48.120
 to see gardening as a way of communication

1:07:48.120 --> 1:07:48.960
 between humans and plants.

1:07:48.960 --> 1:07:50.320
 Oh, okay, you've got me there.

1:07:50.320 --> 1:07:53.120
 But there's ways, there's always going to be

1:07:53.120 --> 1:07:55.000
 the people who are curious.

1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:58.520
 Jane Goodall who lives with the chimps, right?

1:07:58.520 --> 1:08:00.900
 There's always going to be curious intelligent species

1:08:00.900 --> 1:08:05.900
 that visit the weird Earth planet and try to interact.

1:08:06.520 --> 1:08:10.360
 I mean, it's a, yeah, I think it's a super cool idea

1:08:10.360 --> 1:08:11.180
 that you're expressing.

1:08:11.180 --> 1:08:13.000
 I just kind of have a sense.

1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:16.120
 Maybe it's a hope that there's always going to be

1:08:16.120 --> 1:08:18.160
 a desire to interact even with those

1:08:18.160 --> 1:08:21.360
 that can't possibly understand the depth

1:08:21.360 --> 1:08:22.960
 of what you understand.

1:08:22.960 --> 1:08:25.680
 So I'm with you, so I want to be as positive as you

1:08:25.680 --> 1:08:29.340
 that aliens do exist and we will interact with them.

1:08:29.340 --> 1:08:30.800
 What I'm trying to do is to give you

1:08:30.800 --> 1:08:35.000
 a reasonable hypothesis why we haven't yet.

1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:35.840
 Yeah.

1:08:35.840 --> 1:08:38.840
 And also something to strive for to be able to do that.

1:08:38.840 --> 1:08:41.720
 I mean, you know, there is the other view

1:08:41.720 --> 1:08:43.760
 that the universe is just too big

1:08:43.760 --> 1:08:46.060
 and life is just too rare.

1:08:46.060 --> 1:08:49.280
 But I want to come up with an alternative explanation

1:08:49.280 --> 1:08:53.200
 which I think is reasonable and not being philosophically

1:08:53.200 --> 1:08:55.940
 and scientifically thought out, which is this,

1:08:55.940 --> 1:08:59.220
 if you can't actually communicate with the object,

1:08:59.220 --> 1:09:03.480
 the thing competently, you don't even know it's there,

1:09:03.480 --> 1:09:05.160
 then there's no point yet.

1:09:05.160 --> 1:09:07.440
 See, I disagree with that, but I'm totally aligned

1:09:07.440 --> 1:09:09.040
 with your hopeful vision, which is like,

1:09:09.040 --> 1:09:11.520
 we need to understand the origin of life.

1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:13.440
 It will help us engineer life.

1:09:13.440 --> 1:09:16.320
 It will help us engineer intelligent life through perhaps

1:09:16.320 --> 1:09:18.560
 on the computer side through simulation

1:09:18.560 --> 1:09:20.920
 and explore all the ways that life emerges.

1:09:20.920 --> 1:09:24.120
 And that will allow us to, I think the fundamental reason

1:09:24.120 --> 1:09:27.160
 we don't see overwhelming amounts of life

1:09:27.160 --> 1:09:31.160
 is I actually believe aliens,

1:09:31.160 --> 1:09:35.760
 of course, these are all just kind of open minded beliefs.

1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:37.960
 It's difficult to know for sure about any of this,

1:09:37.960 --> 1:09:40.920
 but I think there's a lot of alien civilizations

1:09:40.920 --> 1:09:44.640
 which are actively communicating with us and we're too dumb.

1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:47.720
 We don't have the right tools to see it.

1:09:47.720 --> 1:09:48.560
 That's what I'm saying.

1:09:48.560 --> 1:09:51.880
 No, but maybe I misinterpreted you,

1:09:51.880 --> 1:09:56.240
 but I interpreted you to say they kind of tried a few times

1:09:56.240 --> 1:09:57.520
 and they're like, oh God.

1:09:57.520 --> 1:10:00.680
 No, no, no, what I'm saying is we, so this goes two ways.

1:10:00.680 --> 1:10:01.780
 Yeah, I agree with you.

1:10:01.780 --> 1:10:03.860
 There could be information out there,

1:10:03.860 --> 1:10:05.000
 but just put in such a way

1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:06.600
 that we just don't understand it yet.

1:10:06.600 --> 1:10:07.440
 Right.

1:10:07.440 --> 1:10:09.260
 So sorry if I didn't make that clear.

1:10:09.260 --> 1:10:11.120
 I mean, it's not just, I don't think we,

1:10:11.120 --> 1:10:15.600
 I think we qualify as soon as we can decode their signal.

1:10:15.600 --> 1:10:17.880
 Right, so when you say qualify, got it, got it.

1:10:17.880 --> 1:10:19.680
 So you mean, we're just not smart enough,

1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:21.320
 the word qualify was throwing me off.

1:10:21.320 --> 1:10:22.520
 So we're not smart enough to do,

1:10:22.520 --> 1:10:25.240
 it's like we just need to get smarter.

1:10:25.240 --> 1:10:27.440
 And there's a lot of people who believe,

1:10:27.440 --> 1:10:31.640
 let me get your opinion on this, about UFO sightings.

1:10:31.640 --> 1:10:36.640
 So sightings of weird phenomena

1:10:36.640 --> 1:10:41.640
 that, you know, what does UFO mean?

1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:45.040
 It means it's a flying object

1:10:45.040 --> 1:10:50.040
 and it's not identified clearly at the time of sighting.

1:10:50.440 --> 1:10:51.800
 That's what UFO means.

1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:53.760
 So it could be a physics phenomena,

1:10:53.760 --> 1:10:54.640
 it could be ball lightning,

1:10:54.640 --> 1:10:56.440
 it could be all kinds of fascinating.

1:10:56.440 --> 1:10:58.840
 I was always fascinated with ball lightning as a,

1:11:00.420 --> 1:11:03.160
 like the fact that there could be physical phenomena

1:11:03.160 --> 1:11:06.320
 in this world that are observable by the human eye.

1:11:06.320 --> 1:11:09.640
 Of course, all physical phenomena generally are fascinating

1:11:09.640 --> 1:11:14.160
 that really smart people can't explain.

1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:15.080
 I love that.

1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:16.560
 Cause it's like, wait a minute,

1:11:16.560 --> 1:11:18.560
 especially if you can replicate it,

1:11:18.560 --> 1:11:20.160
 it's like, wait a minute, how does this happen?

1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:23.600
 That's like the precursor to giant discoveries

1:11:23.600 --> 1:11:25.980
 in chemistry and biology and physics and so on.

1:11:25.980 --> 1:11:29.560
 But it sucks when those events are super rare, right?

1:11:29.560 --> 1:11:31.340
 Physically, like ball lightning.

1:11:32.280 --> 1:11:34.200
 So that's out there.

1:11:34.200 --> 1:11:36.440
 And then of course that phenomena

1:11:36.440 --> 1:11:37.920
 could have other interpretations

1:11:37.920 --> 1:11:40.280
 that don't have to do with the physics of chemistry,

1:11:40.280 --> 1:11:42.200
 the biology of earth.

1:11:42.200 --> 1:11:43.360
 It could have to do

1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:46.840
 with more extraterrestrial explanations

1:11:46.840 --> 1:11:50.480
 that in large part, thanks to Hollywood and movies

1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:51.760
 and all those kinds of things,

1:11:51.760 --> 1:11:54.320
 captivates the imaginations of millions of people.

1:11:56.520 --> 1:11:58.640
 But just because it's science fiction

1:11:58.640 --> 1:12:00.440
 that captivates the imagination of people,

1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:03.520
 it doesn't mean that some of those sightings,

1:12:03.520 --> 1:12:05.340
 all it takes is one.

1:12:05.340 --> 1:12:09.160
 One of those sightings is actually a sign

1:12:09.160 --> 1:12:11.960
 that it's extraterrestrial intelligence,

1:12:11.960 --> 1:12:16.960
 that it's object that's not of this particular world.

1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:18.960
 Do you think there's a chance that that's the case?

1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:21.180
 What do you make, especially the pilot sightings,

1:12:21.180 --> 1:12:22.520
 what do you make of those?

1:12:23.920 --> 1:12:26.040
 So I agree with there's a chance.

1:12:26.040 --> 1:12:26.860
 There's always a chance.

1:12:26.860 --> 1:12:29.400
 Any good scientist would have to,

1:12:29.400 --> 1:12:31.200
 or observationist would have to,

1:12:31.200 --> 1:12:36.160
 I want to see if aliens exist come to earth.

1:12:36.160 --> 1:12:37.880
 What I know about the universe

1:12:37.880 --> 1:12:40.000
 is I think it's unlikely right now

1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:44.520
 that there are aliens visiting us, but not impossible.

1:12:44.520 --> 1:12:48.560
 I think the releases, the dramatization

1:12:48.560 --> 1:12:49.880
 that's been happening politically

1:12:49.880 --> 1:12:51.640
 saying we're gonna release all this information,

1:12:51.640 --> 1:12:53.620
 this classified information.

1:12:54.800 --> 1:12:55.880
 I was kind of disappointed

1:12:55.880 --> 1:13:00.880
 because it was just very poor material.

1:13:02.040 --> 1:13:07.040
 And right now, the ability to capture high resolution video,

1:13:08.680 --> 1:13:10.320
 everybody is carrying around

1:13:10.320 --> 1:13:12.480
 with them an incredible video device now.

1:13:12.480 --> 1:13:17.480
 And we haven't got more compelling data.

1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:22.680
 And so that we've just seeing grainy pictures,

1:13:22.680 --> 1:13:26.440
 a lot of hearsay, instrument kind of malfunctions

1:13:26.440 --> 1:13:27.280
 and whatnot.

1:13:27.280 --> 1:13:30.660
 And so I think on balance, I think it's extremely unlikely,

1:13:30.660 --> 1:13:33.360
 but I think something really interesting is happening.

1:13:34.760 --> 1:13:36.400
 And then also during the pandemic, right?

1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:37.480
 We've all been locked down.

1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:38.320
 We all want to have,

1:13:38.320 --> 1:13:42.120
 we want to, our imaginations are running riot.

1:13:42.120 --> 1:13:44.120
 And I think that the,

1:13:44.120 --> 1:13:46.280
 I don't think that the information out there

1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:47.600
 has convinced me there are any,

1:13:47.600 --> 1:13:49.680
 anything interesting on the UFO side.

1:13:49.680 --> 1:13:51.760
 But what it has made me very interested about

1:13:51.760 --> 1:13:56.760
 is how humanity is opening up its mind to ponder aliens

1:13:57.520 --> 1:14:00.480
 and the mystery of our universe.

1:14:00.480 --> 1:14:02.720
 And so I don't want to dissuade people

1:14:02.720 --> 1:14:04.440
 from having those thoughts and say, you're stupid

1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:06.140
 and look at that, it's clearly incorrect.

1:14:06.140 --> 1:14:06.980
 That's not right.

1:14:06.980 --> 1:14:07.820
 That's not fair.

1:14:07.820 --> 1:14:10.880
 What I would say is that I lack sufficient data,

1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:14.080
 replicated observations to make me go,

1:14:14.080 --> 1:14:16.600
 oh, I'm gonna take this seriously,

1:14:16.600 --> 1:14:18.260
 but I'm really interested by the fact

1:14:18.260 --> 1:14:21.600
 that there is this great deal of interest.

1:14:21.600 --> 1:14:24.640
 And I think that it drives me

1:14:24.640 --> 1:14:28.600
 to maybe want to make an artificial life form even more

1:14:28.600 --> 1:14:31.520
 and to help NASA and the Air Force

1:14:31.520 --> 1:14:33.280
 and whoever go and look for things even more,

1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:36.140
 because I think humanity wants to know what's out there.

1:14:36.140 --> 1:14:38.200
 There's this yearning, isn't there?

1:14:38.200 --> 1:14:41.080
 Yeah, but I see, I almost,

1:14:43.800 --> 1:14:45.440
 depending on the day, I sometimes agree with you,

1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:47.840
 but with the thing you just said,

1:14:47.840 --> 1:14:52.680
 but one of the disappointing things to me

1:14:52.680 --> 1:14:56.000
 about the sightings, I still hold the belief

1:14:56.000 --> 1:15:00.120
 that a nonzero number of them

1:15:02.520 --> 1:15:04.920
 is an indication of something very interesting.

1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:09.800
 So I don't side with the people who say

1:15:09.800 --> 1:15:10.840
 everything can be explained

1:15:10.840 --> 1:15:13.320
 with sensor artifacts kind of thing.

1:15:13.320 --> 1:15:14.280
 Yeah, I agree with you.

1:15:14.280 --> 1:15:15.160
 I didn't say that either.

1:15:15.160 --> 1:15:17.360
 I would say I just don't have enough data.

1:15:17.360 --> 1:15:20.840
 But the thing I want to push back on is the statement

1:15:20.840 --> 1:15:23.420
 that everybody has a high definition camera.

1:15:23.420 --> 1:15:24.960
 One of the disappointing things to me

1:15:24.960 --> 1:15:27.000
 about the report that the government released,

1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.400
 but in general, just having worked with government,

1:15:29.400 --> 1:15:32.840
 having worked with people all over

1:15:32.840 --> 1:15:36.240
 is how incompetent we are.

1:15:36.240 --> 1:15:38.800
 Like if you look at the response to the pandemic,

1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:43.240
 how incompetent we are in the face of great challenges

1:15:44.240 --> 1:15:46.080
 without great leadership.

1:15:46.080 --> 1:15:47.900
 How incompetent we are in the face

1:15:47.900 --> 1:15:51.680
 of the great mysteries before us without great leadership.

1:15:51.680 --> 1:15:54.040
 And I just think it's actually,

1:15:54.040 --> 1:15:56.000
 the fact that there's a lot of high definition cameras

1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:01.000
 is not enough to capture the full richness of weird,

1:16:01.640 --> 1:16:03.880
 of the mysterious phenomena out there

1:16:03.880 --> 1:16:07.080
 of which extraterrestrial intelligence visiting Earth

1:16:07.080 --> 1:16:08.080
 could be one.

1:16:08.080 --> 1:16:09.400
 I don't think we have,

1:16:09.400 --> 1:16:12.040
 I don't think everybody having a smartphone

1:16:12.040 --> 1:16:14.880
 in their pocket is enough.

1:16:14.880 --> 1:16:17.440
 I think that allows for TikTok videos.

1:16:17.440 --> 1:16:19.920
 I don't think it allows for the capture

1:16:19.920 --> 1:16:23.800
 of even interesting, relatively rare human events.

1:16:23.800 --> 1:16:25.400
 That's not that common.

1:16:25.400 --> 1:16:28.600
 It's rare to have been the right moment in the right time

1:16:28.600 --> 1:16:30.600
 to be able to capture the thing.

1:16:30.600 --> 1:16:31.520
 I agree, I agree.

1:16:31.520 --> 1:16:33.960
 Let me rephrase what I think on this.

1:16:33.960 --> 1:16:35.760
 I haven't seen enough information.

1:16:35.760 --> 1:16:37.400
 I haven't really actively sorted out.

1:16:37.400 --> 1:16:40.120
 I must admit, but I'm with you

1:16:40.120 --> 1:16:42.560
 and I love the idea of anomaly detection

1:16:42.560 --> 1:16:44.080
 in chemistry in particular, right?

1:16:44.080 --> 1:16:45.800
 I want to make anomalies, sorry,

1:16:45.800 --> 1:16:47.720
 or not necessarily make anomalies.

1:16:47.720 --> 1:16:50.800
 I want to understand an anomaly.

1:16:50.800 --> 1:16:52.560
 Let me give you two from chemistry,

1:16:53.800 --> 1:16:55.640
 which are really quite interesting.

1:16:56.680 --> 1:16:59.280
 Phlogiston, going way back,

1:16:59.280 --> 1:17:02.080
 where people said there's this thing called phlogiston.

1:17:02.080 --> 1:17:05.920
 And for ages, the alchemists got really this kind of,

1:17:05.920 --> 1:17:07.920
 that fire is the thing.

1:17:09.120 --> 1:17:09.960
 That's one.

1:17:09.960 --> 1:17:11.200
 And then we determined that phlogiston

1:17:11.200 --> 1:17:13.400
 wasn't what we thought it is.

1:17:13.400 --> 1:17:15.280
 Let's go to physics, the ether.

1:17:15.280 --> 1:17:16.440
 The ether's a hard one

1:17:16.440 --> 1:17:18.480
 because I think actually the ether might exist.

1:17:18.480 --> 1:17:20.920
 And I'll tell you what I think the ether is later.

1:17:24.040 --> 1:17:25.080
 Can you explain the ether?

1:17:25.080 --> 1:17:26.160
 So as the vacuum,

1:17:26.160 --> 1:17:28.640
 so the light traveling through the ether in the vacuum,

1:17:28.640 --> 1:17:30.720
 there is some thing that we call the ether

1:17:30.720 --> 1:17:34.400
 that basically mediates the movement of light, say.

1:17:34.400 --> 1:17:36.160
 And I think that...

1:17:36.160 --> 1:17:38.240
 And then the other one is cold fusion,

1:17:38.240 --> 1:17:39.080
 which is more of a...

1:17:39.080 --> 1:17:40.340
 So a few years ago,

1:17:40.340 --> 1:17:44.340
 people observed that when they did some electrochemistry,

1:17:44.340 --> 1:17:48.260
 when they were splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen,

1:17:48.260 --> 1:17:50.660
 that you got more energy out than you put in.

1:17:50.660 --> 1:17:51.900
 And people got excited

1:17:51.900 --> 1:17:54.700
 and they thought that this was a nuclear reaction.

1:17:54.700 --> 1:17:57.980
 And in the end, it was kind of discredited

1:17:57.980 --> 1:17:59.900
 because you didn't detect neutrons and all this stuff.

1:17:59.900 --> 1:18:02.980
 But I'm pretty sure...

1:18:02.980 --> 1:18:03.820
 I'm a chemist.

1:18:03.820 --> 1:18:06.140
 I'm telling you this on your podcast, but why not?

1:18:06.140 --> 1:18:07.380
 I'm pretty sure there's interesting

1:18:07.380 --> 1:18:08.380
 electrochemical phenomena

1:18:08.380 --> 1:18:09.900
 that's not completely bottomed out yet,

1:18:09.900 --> 1:18:11.460
 that there is something there.

1:18:11.460 --> 1:18:15.980
 However, we lack the technology and the experimental design.

1:18:15.980 --> 1:18:18.260
 So all I'm saying in your response about aliens

1:18:18.260 --> 1:18:20.420
 is we lack the experimental design

1:18:20.420 --> 1:18:22.500
 to really capture these anomalies.

1:18:22.500 --> 1:18:25.740
 And we are encircling the planet

1:18:25.740 --> 1:18:27.360
 with many more detection systems.

1:18:27.360 --> 1:18:28.980
 We've got satellites everywhere.

1:18:28.980 --> 1:18:30.660
 So there is, I do hope

1:18:30.660 --> 1:18:32.300
 that we are gonna discover more anomalies.

1:18:32.300 --> 1:18:35.540
 And remember that the solar system

1:18:35.540 --> 1:18:37.020
 isn't just static in space,

1:18:37.020 --> 1:18:39.180
 it's moving through the universe.

1:18:39.180 --> 1:18:40.740
 So there's just more and more chance.

1:18:40.740 --> 1:18:42.740
 I'm not what with Avi Loeb.

1:18:42.740 --> 1:18:46.780
 He's generating all sorts of kind of a cult,

1:18:46.780 --> 1:18:50.500
 I would say, with this, but I'm not against him.

1:18:50.500 --> 1:18:52.060
 I think there is a finite chance

1:18:52.060 --> 1:18:53.180
 if there are aliens in the universe

1:18:53.180 --> 1:18:54.780
 that we're gonna happen upon them

1:18:54.780 --> 1:18:56.260
 because we're moving through the universe.

1:18:56.260 --> 1:18:59.780
 What's the nature of the following that Avi Loeb has?

1:18:59.780 --> 1:19:01.220
 He's doubling down more and more and more

1:19:01.220 --> 1:19:02.220
 and say there are aliens,

1:19:02.220 --> 1:19:04.460
 interdimensional aliens and everything else, right?

1:19:04.460 --> 1:19:06.860
 He's gone from space junk accelerating out of

1:19:06.860 --> 1:19:11.340
 to interdimensional stuff in a very short space of time.

1:19:11.340 --> 1:19:12.180
 I see.

1:19:12.180 --> 1:19:13.020
 He's obviously bored.

1:19:15.020 --> 1:19:18.740
 Or he wants to tap into the psyche and understand.

1:19:18.740 --> 1:19:21.140
 And he's playfully kind of trying to interact

1:19:21.140 --> 1:19:22.880
 with society and his peers to say,

1:19:22.880 --> 1:19:26.540
 stop saying it's not possible.

1:19:26.540 --> 1:19:28.540
 Which I agree with, we shouldn't do that.

1:19:28.540 --> 1:19:30.640
 But we should frame it statistically

1:19:30.640 --> 1:19:32.800
 in the same way we should frame everything

1:19:32.800 --> 1:19:34.920
 as good scientists, statistically.

1:19:34.920 --> 1:19:39.920
 Yeah, good scientists.

1:19:40.280 --> 1:19:43.560
 Recently, the idea of good scientists is,

1:19:45.920 --> 1:19:47.760
 I take quite skeptically.

1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:49.400
 I've been listening to a lot of scientists

1:19:49.400 --> 1:19:52.680
 tell me about what is good science.

1:19:52.680 --> 1:19:53.520
 That makes me sad.

1:19:53.520 --> 1:19:54.440
 Because you've been interviewing

1:19:54.440 --> 1:19:56.680
 what I would consider a lot of really good scientists.

1:19:56.680 --> 1:19:57.520
 No, that's true.

1:19:57.520 --> 1:19:58.340
 A lot of great thinkers.

1:19:58.340 --> 1:19:59.960
 But that's exactly right.

1:19:59.960 --> 1:20:01.360
 And most of the people I talk to

1:20:01.360 --> 1:20:03.520
 are incredible human beings.

1:20:03.520 --> 1:20:05.840
 But there's a humility that's required.

1:20:05.840 --> 1:20:10.000
 Science is not, science cannot be dogmatism.

1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:11.000
 Sure, I agree.

1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:16.000
 I mean, authority, like a PhD does not give you authority.

1:20:17.040 --> 1:20:19.520
 A lifelong pursuit of a particular task

1:20:19.520 --> 1:20:21.000
 does not give you authority.

1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:24.000
 You're just as lost in clues as everybody else.

1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:27.280
 But you're more curious and more stubborn.

1:20:27.280 --> 1:20:29.920
 So that's a nice quality to have.

1:20:29.920 --> 1:20:34.920
 But overall, just using the word science and statistics

1:20:37.280 --> 1:20:42.280
 can often, as you know, kind of become a catalyst

1:20:43.440 --> 1:20:48.440
 for dismissing new ideas, out of the box ideas, wild ideas,

1:20:49.700 --> 1:20:50.540
 all that kind of stuff.

1:20:50.540 --> 1:20:52.200
 Well, yes and no.

1:20:52.200 --> 1:20:55.560
 I think that, so I like to,

1:20:57.520 --> 1:20:59.720
 some people find me extremely annoying in science

1:20:59.720 --> 1:21:04.100
 because I'm basically, I'm quite rude and disruptive.

1:21:04.100 --> 1:21:05.600
 Not in a rude, you know,

1:21:05.600 --> 1:21:07.480
 some up to people and say they're ugly or stupid

1:21:07.480 --> 1:21:08.320
 or anything like that.

1:21:08.320 --> 1:21:12.240
 I just say, you know, you're wrong.

1:21:12.240 --> 1:21:13.320
 Or why do you think this?

1:21:13.320 --> 1:21:16.880
 And something, a gift I got given by society

1:21:16.880 --> 1:21:17.720
 when I was very young,

1:21:17.720 --> 1:21:20.640
 because I was in the learning difficulties class at school

1:21:20.640 --> 1:21:22.760
 is I was told I was stupid.

1:21:22.760 --> 1:21:24.880
 And so I know I'm stupid,

1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:26.920
 but I always wanted to be smart, right?

1:21:26.920 --> 1:21:29.040
 I remember going to school going,

1:21:29.040 --> 1:21:30.560
 maybe today they're going to tell me

1:21:30.560 --> 1:21:32.360
 I'm not as stupid as I was yesterday.

1:21:32.360 --> 1:21:34.440
 And I was always disappointed, always.

1:21:34.440 --> 1:21:36.640
 And so when I went into academia and everyone says,

1:21:36.640 --> 1:21:39.140
 you're wrong, I was like, join the queue.

1:21:39.140 --> 1:21:40.720
 Yeah.

1:21:40.720 --> 1:21:43.460
 Because it allowed me to walk through the wall.

1:21:43.460 --> 1:21:46.200
 So I think that people like to always imagine science

1:21:46.200 --> 1:21:48.120
 as a bit like living in a Japanese house,

1:21:48.120 --> 1:21:52.000
 the paper walls, and everyone sits in their room.

1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:54.320
 And I annoy people because I walk straight through the wall.

1:21:54.320 --> 1:21:56.720
 Not because, why should I be a chemist

1:21:56.720 --> 1:21:58.040
 and not a mathematician?

1:21:58.040 --> 1:22:00.440
 Why should I be a mathematician and not a computer scientist?

1:22:00.440 --> 1:22:02.320
 Because if the problem requires us

1:22:02.320 --> 1:22:05.040
 to walk through those walls,

1:22:05.040 --> 1:22:08.400
 but I like walking through the walls.

1:22:08.400 --> 1:22:11.160
 But as long, then I have to put up,

1:22:11.160 --> 1:22:12.440
 you know, I have to do good science.

1:22:12.440 --> 1:22:15.440
 I have to win the people in those rooms

1:22:15.440 --> 1:22:17.240
 across by good science,

1:22:17.240 --> 1:22:21.000
 by taking their criticisms and addressing them head on.

1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:22.440
 And I think we must do that.

1:22:22.440 --> 1:22:25.240
 And I think that I try and do that in my own way.

1:22:25.240 --> 1:22:28.120
 And I kind of love walking through the walls.

1:22:29.100 --> 1:22:33.200
 And it gives me, it's difficult for me personally.

1:22:33.200 --> 1:22:35.100
 It's quite painful,

1:22:35.100 --> 1:22:38.280
 but it always leads to a deeper understanding

1:22:38.280 --> 1:22:39.360
 of the people I'm with.

1:22:39.360 --> 1:22:41.040
 In particular, you know, the arguments I have

1:22:41.040 --> 1:22:43.400
 with all sorts of interesting minds,

1:22:43.400 --> 1:22:45.840
 because I want to solve the problem,

1:22:45.840 --> 1:22:48.380
 or I want to understand more about why I exist.

1:22:49.280 --> 1:22:52.660
 You know, that's it really.

1:22:52.660 --> 1:22:55.120
 And I think we have to not dismiss science

1:22:55.120 --> 1:22:55.960
 on that basis.

1:22:55.960 --> 1:22:58.240
 I think we can work with science.

1:22:58.240 --> 1:22:59.420
 No, science is beautiful,

1:22:59.420 --> 1:23:03.160
 but humans with egos and all those kinds of things

1:23:03.160 --> 1:23:08.160
 can sometimes misuse good things,

1:23:08.720 --> 1:23:10.680
 like social justice,

1:23:10.680 --> 1:23:14.200
 like all ideas we're all aspire to misuse

1:23:14.200 --> 1:23:18.680
 these beautiful ideas to manipulate people,

1:23:18.680 --> 1:23:20.080
 to all those kinds of things.

1:23:20.080 --> 1:23:20.920
 Sure.

1:23:20.920 --> 1:23:24.600
 And that's, there's assholes in every space

1:23:24.600 --> 1:23:26.600
 and walk of life, including science.

1:23:26.600 --> 1:23:27.440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

1:23:27.440 --> 1:23:28.800
 And those are no good.

1:23:28.800 --> 1:23:29.800
 But yes, you're right.

1:23:29.800 --> 1:23:34.600
 The scientific method has proven to be quite useful.

1:23:34.600 --> 1:23:36.520
 That said, for difficult questions,

1:23:36.520 --> 1:23:41.520
 for difficult explanations for rare phenomena,

1:23:42.960 --> 1:23:44.780
 you have to walk cautiously.

1:23:47.320 --> 1:23:50.200
 Because the scientific method,

1:23:50.200 --> 1:23:53.200
 when you totally don't understand something,

1:23:53.200 --> 1:23:55.440
 and it's rare, and you can't replicate it,

1:23:55.440 --> 1:23:57.080
 doesn't quite apply.

1:23:57.080 --> 1:23:58.420
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it.

1:23:58.420 --> 1:23:59.260
 I agree with you.

1:23:59.260 --> 1:24:02.080
 The challenge is to not dismiss the anomaly

1:24:02.080 --> 1:24:03.520
 because you can't replicate it.

1:24:03.520 --> 1:24:05.220
 I mean, we can talk about this.

1:24:05.220 --> 1:24:06.480
 This is something I realized

1:24:06.480 --> 1:24:08.520
 when we were developing assembly theory.

1:24:10.720 --> 1:24:13.920
 People thinking that the track they're on

1:24:13.920 --> 1:24:18.000
 is so dogmatic, but there is this thing that they see,

1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:19.040
 but they don't see.

1:24:19.040 --> 1:24:20.240
 And it takes a bit of time

1:24:20.240 --> 1:24:21.740
 and you just have to keep reframing it.

1:24:21.740 --> 1:24:25.040
 And my approach is to say, well, why can't this be right?

1:24:25.040 --> 1:24:29.480
 Why must we accept that RNA is the only way into life?

1:24:29.480 --> 1:24:30.480
 I mean, who said?

1:24:30.480 --> 1:24:35.480
 Does RNA have a special class of information

1:24:35.800 --> 1:24:37.160
 that's encoded in the universe?

1:24:37.160 --> 1:24:38.600
 No, of course it doesn't, right?

1:24:38.600 --> 1:24:41.080
 RNA is not a special molecule

1:24:41.080 --> 1:24:42.840
 in the space of all the other molecules.

1:24:42.840 --> 1:24:44.520
 But it's so elegant and simple

1:24:44.520 --> 1:24:46.680
 and it works so well for the evolutionary process

1:24:46.680 --> 1:24:48.600
 that we kind of use that as an intuition

1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:51.440
 to explain that that must be the only way to have life.

1:24:51.440 --> 1:24:52.280
 Sure.

1:24:53.320 --> 1:24:55.160
 But you mentioned assembly theory.

1:24:55.160 --> 1:24:57.680
 Well, first let me pause, bathroom break, needed?

1:24:57.680 --> 1:24:59.880
 Yeah, let's take two minutes.

1:24:59.880 --> 1:25:02.480
 We took a quick break and offline,

1:25:02.480 --> 1:25:07.380
 you mentioned to me that you have a lab in your home.

1:25:08.320 --> 1:25:10.640
 And then I said that you're basically Rick

1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:11.560
 from Rick and Morty,

1:25:11.560 --> 1:25:13.640
 which is something I've been thinking

1:25:13.640 --> 1:25:15.200
 this whole conversation.

1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:19.080
 And then you say that there's a glowing pickle

1:25:19.080 --> 1:25:23.540
 that you used something involving cold plasma, I believe.

1:25:23.540 --> 1:25:24.860
 I don't know, but can you explain

1:25:24.860 --> 1:25:26.280
 the glowing pickle situation?

1:25:31.420 --> 1:25:34.380
 And is there many, arbitrarily many versions of you

1:25:34.380 --> 1:25:37.380
 in alternate dimensions that you're aware of?

1:25:37.380 --> 1:25:41.500
 I tried to make an electrochemical memory at home

1:25:41.500 --> 1:25:45.580
 using a pickle and the only way I could get

1:25:45.580 --> 1:25:49.140
 any traction with it was actually by plugging it

1:25:49.140 --> 1:25:51.620
 into a very high voltage alternating current

1:25:51.620 --> 1:25:53.840
 and then putting in a couple of electrodes.

1:25:53.840 --> 1:25:54.980
 But my kids weren't impressed.

1:25:54.980 --> 1:25:56.580
 They're not impressed with anything I do,

1:25:56.580 --> 1:25:57.880
 any experiments I do at home.

1:25:57.880 --> 1:25:58.900
 I think it's quite funny.

1:25:58.900 --> 1:26:01.300
 But you connected a pickle to some electrode.

1:26:01.300 --> 1:26:03.460
 240 volts, yeah, AC.

1:26:03.460 --> 1:26:04.860
 And then had a couple of electrodes on it.

1:26:04.860 --> 1:26:06.260
 So what happens is a pickle,

1:26:07.700 --> 1:26:09.820
 this is a classic thing you do.

1:26:09.820 --> 1:26:11.500
 I mean, I shouldn't, pranks you do,

1:26:11.500 --> 1:26:13.180
 you put a pickle into the mains

1:26:13.180 --> 1:26:15.180
 and just leave it, run away and leave it.

1:26:15.180 --> 1:26:17.620
 And what happens is it starts to decompose.

1:26:17.620 --> 1:26:19.060
 It heats up and then explodes

1:26:19.060 --> 1:26:20.980
 because the water turns to steam

1:26:20.980 --> 1:26:22.740
 and it just violently explodes.

1:26:22.740 --> 1:26:25.300
 But I wondered if I could cause the iron,

1:26:25.300 --> 1:26:27.420
 sodium, potassium ions in the pickle to migrate.

1:26:27.420 --> 1:26:28.740
 It'd been in a jar, right?

1:26:28.740 --> 1:26:31.120
 So it'd been in a brine.

1:26:31.120 --> 1:26:34.340
 That was, yeah, that was not my best experiment.

1:26:34.340 --> 1:26:36.940
 So I've done far better experiments in my lab at home.

1:26:36.940 --> 1:26:38.500
 At that time it was a failed experiment,

1:26:38.500 --> 1:26:40.180
 but you never know, it could,

1:26:41.580 --> 1:26:44.580
 every experiment is a successful experiment

1:26:44.580 --> 1:26:46.020
 if you stick with it long enough.

1:26:46.020 --> 1:26:48.260
 Well, I mean, I get, I got kicked out of my own lab

1:26:48.260 --> 1:26:50.840
 by my research team many years ago and for good reason.

1:26:50.840 --> 1:26:51.900
 I mean, my team is brilliant

1:26:51.900 --> 1:26:53.820
 and I used to go and just break things.

1:26:53.820 --> 1:26:55.420
 So what I do do at home

1:26:55.420 --> 1:26:57.580
 is I have a kind of electronics workshop

1:26:58.780 --> 1:27:01.380
 and I prototype experiments there.

1:27:01.380 --> 1:27:05.260
 Then I try and then I try and suggest to my team sometimes,

1:27:05.260 --> 1:27:07.180
 maybe we can try this thing.

1:27:07.180 --> 1:27:08.460
 And they would just say, oh,

1:27:08.460 --> 1:27:10.140
 wow, that's not gonna work because of this.

1:27:10.140 --> 1:27:12.020
 And I'll say, aha, but actually I've tried

1:27:12.020 --> 1:27:14.100
 and here's some code and here's some hardware.

1:27:14.100 --> 1:27:15.220
 Can we have a go?

1:27:15.220 --> 1:27:17.460
 So I'm doing that less and less now

1:27:17.460 --> 1:27:20.740
 as I get even more busy, but that's quite fun

1:27:20.740 --> 1:27:24.180
 because they feel that we're in the experiment together.

1:27:24.180 --> 1:27:28.540
 You do, in fact, brilliantly, just like Rick

1:27:28.540 --> 1:27:33.540
 from Rick and Morty, connect up chemistry with computation.

1:27:38.860 --> 1:27:40.140
 And when we say chemistry,

1:27:40.140 --> 1:27:45.140
 we don't mean the simulation of chemistry,

1:27:45.420 --> 1:27:46.940
 a modeling of chemistry.

1:27:46.940 --> 1:27:49.260
 We mean chemistry in the physical space

1:27:49.260 --> 1:27:52.180
 as well as in the digital space, which is fascinating.

1:27:52.180 --> 1:27:54.260
 We'll talk about that.

1:27:54.260 --> 1:27:56.020
 But first you mentioned assembly theory.

1:27:56.020 --> 1:28:00.780
 So we'll stick on theory in these big ideas.

1:28:00.780 --> 1:28:03.020
 I would say revolutionary ideas,

1:28:03.020 --> 1:28:07.280
 this intersection between mathematics and philosophy.

1:28:07.280 --> 1:28:09.140
 What is assembly theory?

1:28:09.140 --> 1:28:13.660
 And generally speaking, how would we recognize life

1:28:13.660 --> 1:28:15.300
 if we saw it?

1:28:15.300 --> 1:28:17.620
 So assembly theory is a theory,

1:28:17.620 --> 1:28:19.580
 goes back a few years now in my struggle

1:28:19.580 --> 1:28:22.100
 for maybe almost 10 years

1:28:22.100 --> 1:28:24.380
 when I was going to origin of life conferences

1:28:24.380 --> 1:28:25.780
 and artificial life conferences,

1:28:25.780 --> 1:28:28.260
 where I thought that everybody was dancing

1:28:28.260 --> 1:28:32.700
 around the problem of what life is and what it does.

1:28:32.700 --> 1:28:34.420
 But I'll tell you about what assembly theory is

1:28:34.420 --> 1:28:35.820
 because I think it's easier.

1:28:35.820 --> 1:28:39.220
 So assembly theory literally says if you take an object,

1:28:39.220 --> 1:28:40.940
 any given object,

1:28:40.940 --> 1:28:43.860
 and you are able to break the object into parts very gently.

1:28:43.860 --> 1:28:46.380
 So just maybe let's say take a piece

1:28:46.380 --> 1:28:48.980
 of very intricate Chinese porcelain

1:28:48.980 --> 1:28:52.220
 and you tap it just with a hammer or the nail at some point,

1:28:52.220 --> 1:28:54.940
 and it will fragment into many parts.

1:28:54.940 --> 1:28:57.860
 And if that object is able to fragment into many,

1:28:57.860 --> 1:29:00.500
 and you count those parts, the different parts,

1:29:00.500 --> 1:29:02.540
 so they're unsymmetrical,

1:29:02.540 --> 1:29:07.180
 assembly theory says the larger the number of parts,

1:29:07.180 --> 1:29:10.140
 unsymmetrical parts that object has,

1:29:10.140 --> 1:29:12.500
 the more likely it is that object has been created

1:29:12.500 --> 1:29:15.020
 by an evolutionary or information process,

1:29:15.020 --> 1:29:18.940
 especially if that object is not one off,

1:29:18.940 --> 1:29:22.100
 you've got an abundance of them.

1:29:22.100 --> 1:29:23.220
 And that's really important.

1:29:23.220 --> 1:29:26.860
 So because what I'm literally saying about the abundance,

1:29:26.860 --> 1:29:30.260
 if you have a one off object and you break it into parts

1:29:30.260 --> 1:29:32.180
 and it has lots of parts,

1:29:32.180 --> 1:29:36.380
 you'd say, well, that could be incredibly intricate

1:29:36.380 --> 1:29:39.940
 and complex, but it could be just random.

1:29:39.940 --> 1:29:41.740
 And I was troubled with this for years

1:29:41.740 --> 1:29:44.700
 because I saw in reality that assembly theory works.

1:29:44.700 --> 1:29:46.180
 But when I talked to very good

1:29:46.180 --> 1:29:49.700
 computational complexity computation lists,

1:29:49.700 --> 1:29:51.340
 algorithmic complexity people,

1:29:51.340 --> 1:29:53.820
 they said, you haven't really done this properly.

1:29:53.820 --> 1:29:54.780
 You haven't thought about it.

1:29:54.780 --> 1:29:57.660
 It's like, this is the random problem.

1:29:57.660 --> 1:29:59.980
 And so I kept working this up

1:29:59.980 --> 1:30:03.100
 because I invented an assembly theory in chemistry,

1:30:03.100 --> 1:30:05.060
 first of all, with molecules.

1:30:05.060 --> 1:30:06.780
 And so the thought experiment was,

1:30:08.060 --> 1:30:11.460
 how complex does a molecule need to be when I find it

1:30:11.460 --> 1:30:13.460
 that it couldn't possibly have risen by chance,

1:30:13.460 --> 1:30:15.180
 probabilistically.

1:30:15.180 --> 1:30:16.500
 And if I found this molecule,

1:30:16.500 --> 1:30:18.940
 able to detect it enough quantities in the same object,

1:30:18.940 --> 1:30:20.780
 like a machine, like a mass spectrometer.

1:30:20.780 --> 1:30:22.100
 So typically in a mass spectrometer,

1:30:22.100 --> 1:30:24.300
 you weigh the molecules in electric field.

1:30:24.300 --> 1:30:26.300
 You probably have to have all the order of 10,000

1:30:26.300 --> 1:30:28.460
 identical molecules to get a signal.

1:30:28.460 --> 1:30:32.820
 So 10,000 identical molecules that are complex.

1:30:32.820 --> 1:30:36.660
 What is the chance of them occurring by chance?

1:30:36.660 --> 1:30:37.500
 Well, we can do the math.

1:30:37.500 --> 1:30:39.220
 Let's take a molecule like strychnine

1:30:39.220 --> 1:30:44.220
 or, yeah, so strychnine is a good molecule actually to take

1:30:44.980 --> 1:30:46.780
 or Viagra is a good molecule.

1:30:46.780 --> 1:30:49.540
 I made jokes about Viagra because it's a complex molecule.

1:30:49.540 --> 1:30:50.620
 And one of my friends said, yeah,

1:30:50.620 --> 1:30:53.300
 if we find Viagra on Mars in detectable quantities,

1:30:53.300 --> 1:30:54.620
 we know something is up.

1:30:54.620 --> 1:30:59.620
 And yeah, but anyway, it's a complex molecule.

1:31:00.220 --> 1:31:01.660
 So what you do is you take this molecule

1:31:01.660 --> 1:31:03.780
 in the mass spectrometer and you hit it with some electrons

1:31:03.780 --> 1:31:06.220
 or in electric field and it breaks apart.

1:31:06.220 --> 1:31:09.940
 And if the larger the number of different parts,

1:31:09.940 --> 1:31:12.780
 you know when it starts to get refreshed,

1:31:12.780 --> 1:31:15.020
 my idea was that that molecule could not be created

1:31:15.020 --> 1:31:17.180
 by chance, probabilistically.

1:31:17.180 --> 1:31:20.260
 So that was where assembly theory was born

1:31:20.260 --> 1:31:22.780
 in an experiment, in a mass spec experiment.

1:31:22.780 --> 1:31:24.340
 And I was thinking about this

1:31:24.340 --> 1:31:26.940
 because NASA is sending mass spectrometers to Mars,

1:31:26.940 --> 1:31:29.620
 to Titan, it's gonna send them to Europa.

1:31:29.620 --> 1:31:32.020
 There's gonna be a nuclear powered mass spectrometer

1:31:32.020 --> 1:31:33.620
 going to Titan.

1:31:33.620 --> 1:31:35.900
 I mean, this is the coolest experiment ever.

1:31:35.900 --> 1:31:37.260
 They're not only sending a drone

1:31:37.260 --> 1:31:38.460
 that's gonna fly around Titan,

1:31:38.460 --> 1:31:43.460
 it's gonna be powered by a nuclear slug, a nuclear battery,

1:31:43.820 --> 1:31:45.940
 and it's gonna have a mass spectrometer on it.

1:31:45.940 --> 1:31:47.180
 Is this already launched?

1:31:47.180 --> 1:31:49.300
 No, it's Dragonfly

1:31:49.300 --> 1:31:50.900
 and it's gonna be launched in a few years.

1:31:50.900 --> 1:31:53.460
 I think it got pushed a year because of the pandemic.

1:31:53.460 --> 1:31:55.180
 So I think it's three or four years.

1:31:55.180 --> 1:31:59.300
 Dragonfly, nuclear Dragonfly is going to fly to Titan

1:32:00.900 --> 1:32:05.900
 and collect data about the composition

1:32:07.420 --> 1:32:09.580
 of the various chemicals on Titan.

1:32:09.580 --> 1:32:11.340
 Yeah, I'm trying to convince NASA.

1:32:11.340 --> 1:32:12.620
 I don't know if I'll be able to convince

1:32:12.620 --> 1:32:16.980
 the Dragonfly team that they should apply this approach,

1:32:16.980 --> 1:32:18.020
 but they will get data.

1:32:18.020 --> 1:32:20.820
 And depending on how good their mass spectrometer is.

1:32:20.820 --> 1:32:22.340
 But I had this thought experiment anyway,

1:32:22.340 --> 1:32:24.340
 and I did this thought experiment.

1:32:24.340 --> 1:32:26.620
 And for me, it seemed to work.

1:32:26.620 --> 1:32:29.060
 I turned the thought experiment into an algorithm

1:32:29.060 --> 1:32:30.060
 in assembly theory.

1:32:30.060 --> 1:32:32.500
 And I basically, assembly theory, if I take,

1:32:32.500 --> 1:32:33.740
 let's just make it generic.

1:32:33.740 --> 1:32:36.220
 And so let's just take the word abracadabra.

1:32:36.220 --> 1:32:38.940
 Say, can I, if you find the word,

1:32:38.940 --> 1:32:41.140
 so if you have a book with lots of words in it

1:32:41.140 --> 1:32:42.780
 and you find abracadabra one off,

1:32:42.780 --> 1:32:45.500
 and it's a rap book that's been written by,

1:32:45.500 --> 1:32:48.460
 in a random way, set of monkeys in a room.

1:32:48.460 --> 1:32:50.500
 And you're on typewriters.

1:32:50.500 --> 1:32:51.900
 And you find one off abracadabra,

1:32:51.900 --> 1:32:52.740
 no big deal.

1:32:52.740 --> 1:32:55.900
 But if you find lots of recurrences of abracadabra,

1:32:55.900 --> 1:32:57.500
 well, that means something weird is going on.

1:32:57.500 --> 1:33:00.460
 But let's think about the assembly number of abracadabra.

1:33:00.460 --> 1:33:04.820
 So abracadabra has a number of letters in it.

1:33:04.820 --> 1:33:05.700
 You can break it down.

1:33:05.700 --> 1:33:07.540
 So you just cut the letters up.

1:33:07.540 --> 1:33:09.660
 But when you actually reassemble abracadabra,

1:33:09.660 --> 1:33:12.460
 the minimum number of ways of organizing those letters.

1:33:12.460 --> 1:33:16.540
 So you'd have an A, a B, and keep going up.

1:33:18.860 --> 1:33:21.540
 When you cut abracadabra up into parts,

1:33:21.540 --> 1:33:24.060
 you can put it together again in seven steps.

1:33:24.060 --> 1:33:24.900
 So what does that mean?

1:33:24.900 --> 1:33:26.980
 That means if you basically don't,

1:33:26.980 --> 1:33:28.540
 you're allowed to reuse things

1:33:28.540 --> 1:33:30.540
 you make in a chain at the beginning.

1:33:30.540 --> 1:33:32.500
 That's the memory of the universe,

1:33:32.500 --> 1:33:35.020
 the process that makes abracadabra.

1:33:35.020 --> 1:33:36.460
 And because of that causal chain,

1:33:36.460 --> 1:33:38.500
 you can then get to abracadabra

1:33:38.500 --> 1:33:40.460
 quicker than the number of letters

1:33:40.460 --> 1:33:43.180
 for having to specify only in seven.

1:33:43.180 --> 1:33:44.620
 So if you take that to a molecule

1:33:44.620 --> 1:33:47.900
 and you cut the molecule up into parts,

1:33:47.900 --> 1:33:49.820
 and you can, on the causal chain,

1:33:49.820 --> 1:33:51.460
 and you basically start with the atoms

1:33:51.460 --> 1:33:54.500
 and then bonds, and then you randomly add on those parts

1:33:54.500 --> 1:33:58.700
 to make the A, make the B, and keep going all the way up,

1:33:59.700 --> 1:34:01.580
 I found that literally, assembly theory

1:34:01.580 --> 1:34:04.900
 allows me to say how compressed a molecule is.

1:34:04.900 --> 1:34:07.820
 So when there's some information in there.

1:34:07.820 --> 1:34:09.620
 And I realized assembly theory

1:34:09.620 --> 1:34:13.260
 isn't just confined to molecular space.

1:34:13.260 --> 1:34:14.140
 It can apply to anything.

1:34:14.140 --> 1:34:16.020
 But let me finish the molecular argument.

1:34:16.020 --> 1:34:18.660
 So what I did is I had this theory.

1:34:18.660 --> 1:34:22.660
 I, with one of my students, we wrote an algorithm.

1:34:22.660 --> 1:34:26.300
 We basically took the 20 million molecules from a database

1:34:26.300 --> 1:34:28.740
 and we just calculate their assembly number.

1:34:28.740 --> 1:34:29.580
 And that's the index.

1:34:29.580 --> 1:34:32.020
 Like basically, if I take a molecule

1:34:32.020 --> 1:34:33.900
 and I cut it up into bonds,

1:34:33.900 --> 1:34:36.620
 what is the minimum number of steps I need to take

1:34:36.620 --> 1:34:39.700
 to reform that molecule from atoms?

1:34:39.700 --> 1:34:42.580
 So reusability of previously formed things

1:34:42.580 --> 1:34:43.900
 is somehow a fundamental part of what it is.

1:34:43.900 --> 1:34:46.380
 Exactly, it's like a memory in the universe, right?

1:34:46.380 --> 1:34:47.740
 I'm making lots of leaps here.

1:34:47.740 --> 1:34:48.820
 Like, it's kind of weird.

1:34:48.820 --> 1:34:50.060
 I'm saying, right, there's a process

1:34:50.060 --> 1:34:53.380
 that can form the A and the B and the C, let's say.

1:34:53.380 --> 1:34:56.300
 And then because we've formed A and B before,

1:34:56.300 --> 1:35:00.060
 we can use A and B again with no extra cost except one unit.

1:35:00.060 --> 1:35:02.540
 So that's the kind of what the chain of events.

1:35:02.540 --> 1:35:04.260
 And that's how you think about memory here

1:35:04.260 --> 1:35:05.940
 when you say the universe,

1:35:05.940 --> 1:35:07.540
 when you talk about the universe

1:35:07.540 --> 1:35:11.860
 or life is the universe creating memory.

1:35:11.860 --> 1:35:12.860
 Exactly.

1:35:12.860 --> 1:35:15.220
 So we went through chemical space

1:35:15.220 --> 1:35:16.940
 and we looked at the assembly numbers.

1:35:16.940 --> 1:35:18.620
 We were able to classify it.

1:35:18.620 --> 1:35:20.500
 So, okay, let's test it.

1:35:20.500 --> 1:35:21.580
 Let's go.

1:35:21.580 --> 1:35:23.980
 So we're able to take a whole bunch of molecules

1:35:23.980 --> 1:35:27.500
 and assign an assembly index to them, okay?

1:35:27.500 --> 1:35:30.740
 And it's just a function of the number of bonds

1:35:30.740 --> 1:35:32.380
 in the molecule and how much symmetry.

1:35:32.380 --> 1:35:34.820
 So literally assembly theory is a measure

1:35:34.820 --> 1:35:37.940
 of how little symmetry a molecule has.

1:35:37.940 --> 1:35:40.580
 And so the more asymmetry, the more information,

1:35:40.580 --> 1:35:41.420
 the more weird it is,

1:35:41.420 --> 1:35:44.420
 like a Jackson Pollock of some description.

1:35:44.420 --> 1:35:47.740
 So I then went and did a load of experiments.

1:35:47.740 --> 1:35:49.980
 And I basically took those molecules,

1:35:49.980 --> 1:35:51.340
 I cut them up in the mass spec

1:35:51.340 --> 1:35:52.660
 and measured the number of peaks

1:35:52.660 --> 1:35:55.180
 without any knowledge of the molecule.

1:35:55.180 --> 1:35:57.220
 And we found the assembly number,

1:35:57.220 --> 1:36:00.620
 there was almost not quite a one to one correlation,

1:36:00.620 --> 1:36:02.740
 but almost because not all bonds are equal.

1:36:02.740 --> 1:36:03.940
 They have different energies.

1:36:03.940 --> 1:36:07.020
 I then did this using two other spectroscopic techniques,

1:36:07.020 --> 1:36:08.700
 NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance,

1:36:08.700 --> 1:36:11.700
 which uses radio frequency to basically jangle the molecules

1:36:11.700 --> 1:36:13.100
 and get a signature out.

1:36:13.100 --> 1:36:15.060
 And I also used infrared.

1:36:15.060 --> 1:36:18.180
 And infrared and NMR almost gave us a one to one correlation.

1:36:18.180 --> 1:36:19.540
 So what am I saying?

1:36:19.540 --> 1:36:21.780
 Saying by taking a molecule

1:36:21.780 --> 1:36:26.020
 and doing either infrared or NMR or mass spec,

1:36:26.020 --> 1:36:30.060
 I can work out how many parts there are in that molecule

1:36:30.060 --> 1:36:32.300
 and then put it on a scale.

1:36:32.300 --> 1:36:35.580
 And what we did in the next part of the work

1:36:35.580 --> 1:36:39.140
 is we took molecules randomly from the environment,

1:36:39.140 --> 1:36:41.380
 from outer space, from all around earth,

1:36:41.380 --> 1:36:45.660
 from the sea, from Antarctica,

1:36:45.660 --> 1:36:47.500
 and from fossils and so on.

1:36:47.500 --> 1:36:49.700
 And even NASA, because they didn't believe us,

1:36:49.700 --> 1:36:51.540
 blinded some samples.

1:36:51.540 --> 1:36:56.540
 And we found that all these samples that came from biology

1:36:57.380 --> 1:37:00.500
 produced molecules that had a very high assembly number

1:37:00.500 --> 1:37:02.820
 above a threshold of about 15.

1:37:02.820 --> 1:37:05.820
 So basically all the stuff that came

1:37:05.820 --> 1:37:08.620
 from an ebiotic origin was low.

1:37:08.620 --> 1:37:10.180
 There was no complexity there.

1:37:10.180 --> 1:37:12.620
 So we suddenly realized that on earth at least,

1:37:12.620 --> 1:37:16.140
 there is a cutoff that natural phenomena

1:37:16.140 --> 1:37:17.620
 cannot produce molecules

1:37:17.620 --> 1:37:20.020
 that need more than 15 steps to make them.

1:37:21.140 --> 1:37:25.260
 So I realized that this is a way to make a scale of life,

1:37:25.260 --> 1:37:27.380
 a scale of technology as well.

1:37:27.380 --> 1:37:30.460
 And literally you could just go sniffing for molecules

1:37:30.460 --> 1:37:33.340
 off earth, on Titan, on Mars.

1:37:33.340 --> 1:37:35.660
 And when you find a molecule in the mass spectrometer

1:37:35.660 --> 1:37:37.740
 that gives you more than 15 parts,

1:37:37.740 --> 1:37:40.660
 you'll know pretty much for sure

1:37:40.660 --> 1:37:43.220
 that it had to be produced by evolution.

1:37:43.220 --> 1:37:45.380
 And this allowed me to come up with a general definition

1:37:45.380 --> 1:37:47.340
 of life based on assembly theory,

1:37:47.340 --> 1:37:51.380
 to say that if I find an object that has a large number

1:37:51.380 --> 1:37:54.700
 of parts, say an iPhone or Boeing 747,

1:37:54.700 --> 1:37:58.740
 or any complex object and I can find it in abundance

1:37:58.740 --> 1:38:03.060
 and cut it up, I can tell you whether that has been produced

1:38:03.060 --> 1:38:04.980
 by an informational process or not.

1:38:04.980 --> 1:38:07.700
 And that's what assembly theory kind of does.

1:38:07.700 --> 1:38:08.940
 But it goes a bit further.

1:38:09.820 --> 1:38:12.260
 I then realized that this isn't just about life,

1:38:12.260 --> 1:38:14.300
 it's about causation.

1:38:14.300 --> 1:38:15.860
 So actually it tells you about

1:38:15.860 --> 1:38:17.380
 whether it's a causal structure.

1:38:17.380 --> 1:38:19.020
 So now I can look at objects in the universe,

1:38:19.020 --> 1:38:20.780
 say that again, this cup and say, right,

1:38:20.780 --> 1:38:23.740
 I'm gonna look at how many independent parts it has.

1:38:23.740 --> 1:38:25.540
 So that's the assembly number.

1:38:25.540 --> 1:38:28.020
 I'll then look at the abundance, how many cups?

1:38:28.020 --> 1:38:28.940
 There are two on this table,

1:38:28.940 --> 1:38:31.140
 maybe there's a few more you got stashed away.

1:38:31.140 --> 1:38:36.140
 So assembly is a function of the complexity of the object

1:38:37.220 --> 1:38:39.380
 times the number of copy numbers of that object

1:38:39.380 --> 1:38:41.900
 or a function of the copy number normalized.

1:38:41.900 --> 1:38:45.100
 So I realized there's a new quantity in the universe.

1:38:45.100 --> 1:38:48.140
 You have energy, entropy, and assembly.

1:38:49.140 --> 1:38:51.220
 So assembly, the way we should think about that

1:38:51.220 --> 1:38:55.220
 is how much reusability there is.

1:38:55.220 --> 1:38:57.860
 Because reusability is like,

1:38:57.860 --> 1:38:59.700
 can you play devil's advocate to this?

1:38:59.700 --> 1:39:04.700
 So could this just be a nice tertiary signal

1:39:08.060 --> 1:39:10.340
 for living organisms?

1:39:10.340 --> 1:39:13.420
 Like some kind of distant signal that's,

1:39:13.420 --> 1:39:15.140
 yeah, this is a nice property,

1:39:15.140 --> 1:39:17.740
 but it's not capturing something fundamental.

1:39:17.740 --> 1:39:20.260
 Or do you think reusability is something fundamental

1:39:20.260 --> 1:39:22.580
 to life and complex organisms?

1:39:22.580 --> 1:39:25.620
 I think reusability is fundamental in the universe,

1:39:25.620 --> 1:39:27.660
 not just for life and complex organisms.

1:39:27.660 --> 1:39:29.420
 It's about causation.

1:39:29.420 --> 1:39:32.860
 So I think assembly tells you if you find objects,

1:39:32.860 --> 1:39:35.300
 cause you can do this with trajectories as well.

1:39:35.300 --> 1:39:36.380
 You think about it,

1:39:36.380 --> 1:39:41.380
 that the fact there are objects in the universe on earth

1:39:41.820 --> 1:39:42.700
 is weird.

1:39:43.820 --> 1:39:44.660
 You think about it,

1:39:44.660 --> 1:39:47.500
 we should just have a combinatorial explosion of stuff.

1:39:47.500 --> 1:39:52.500
 The fact that not everything exists is really weird.

1:39:53.620 --> 1:39:54.460
 Now then.

1:39:54.460 --> 1:39:59.100
 And then as I'm looking at two mugs and two water bottles

1:39:59.100 --> 1:40:04.100
 and the things that exist kind of are similar

1:40:04.660 --> 1:40:08.100
 and multiply in copies of each other.

1:40:08.100 --> 1:40:10.780
 So I would say that assembly allows you to do something

1:40:10.780 --> 1:40:14.220
 that statistical mechanics and people looking at entropy

1:40:14.220 --> 1:40:16.940
 have got stuck with for a while.

1:40:16.940 --> 1:40:18.420
 So I'm making, it's pretty bold.

1:40:18.420 --> 1:40:20.380
 I mean, I'm writing a paper with Sarah Walker

1:40:20.380 --> 1:40:21.940
 on this at the moment.

1:40:21.940 --> 1:40:23.260
 And we're realizing,

1:40:23.260 --> 1:40:24.340
 we don't want to get ahead of ourselves

1:40:24.340 --> 1:40:27.580
 because I think that there's lots of ways where this is,

1:40:27.580 --> 1:40:30.500
 you know, it's a really interesting idea.

1:40:30.500 --> 1:40:33.420
 It works for molecules and it appears to work

1:40:33.420 --> 1:40:35.540
 for any objects produced by causation.

1:40:35.540 --> 1:40:36.420
 Cause you can take a motor car,

1:40:36.420 --> 1:40:37.620
 you can look at the assembly of the motor car,

1:40:37.620 --> 1:40:39.740
 look at a book, look at the assembly of the book.

1:40:39.740 --> 1:40:41.100
 Assembly theory tells you

1:40:41.100 --> 1:40:43.940
 there's a way of compressing and reusing.

1:40:43.940 --> 1:40:46.740
 And so when people, I talk to information theorists,

1:40:46.740 --> 1:40:48.780
 they say, oh, this is just logical depth.

1:40:48.780 --> 1:40:51.300
 I say, it is like logical depth,

1:40:51.300 --> 1:40:53.940
 but it's experimentally measurable.

1:40:53.940 --> 1:40:55.700
 They say, oh, it's a bit like Komogolov complexity.

1:40:55.700 --> 1:40:57.780
 And so, but it's computable.

1:40:59.020 --> 1:41:00.540
 And now, okay, it's not infinitely computable,

1:41:00.540 --> 1:41:02.300
 gets MP hard very quickly, right?

1:41:02.300 --> 1:41:04.140
 It's very hard problem when you could get,

1:41:04.140 --> 1:41:06.220
 but it's a computable enough,

1:41:06.220 --> 1:41:08.180
 you could tractable enough to be able to tell

1:41:08.180 --> 1:41:09.220
 the difference between a molecule

1:41:09.220 --> 1:41:11.100
 that's been formed by the random background

1:41:11.100 --> 1:41:13.580
 and by causation.

1:41:13.580 --> 1:41:16.540
 And I think that that's really interesting

1:41:16.540 --> 1:41:19.060
 because until now there's no way

1:41:19.060 --> 1:41:21.020
 of measuring complexity objectively.

1:41:21.020 --> 1:41:26.020
 Complexity has required algorithmic comparisons

1:41:26.220 --> 1:41:30.500
 and programs and human beings to label things.

1:41:30.500 --> 1:41:32.620
 Assembly is label free.

1:41:32.620 --> 1:41:34.180
 Well, not entirely.

1:41:34.180 --> 1:41:37.020
 We can talk about what that means in a minute.

1:41:37.020 --> 1:41:42.020
 Okay, my brain has been broken a couple of times here.

1:41:42.020 --> 1:41:43.460
 I'm sorry I explained it really badly.

1:41:43.460 --> 1:41:45.020
 No, it was very well explained.

1:41:45.020 --> 1:41:45.940
 It was just fascinating.

1:41:45.940 --> 1:41:50.380
 And it's, my brain is broken into pieces

1:41:50.380 --> 1:41:51.780
 and I'm trying to assemble it.

1:41:53.180 --> 1:41:55.500
 So MP hard.

1:41:55.500 --> 1:41:58.300
 So when you have a molecule,

1:41:58.300 --> 1:42:01.020
 you're trying to figure out, okay,

1:42:01.020 --> 1:42:03.780
 if we were to reuse parts of this molecule,

1:42:03.780 --> 1:42:08.780
 which parts can we reuse as an optimization problem,

1:42:10.140 --> 1:42:13.500
 and be hard to figure out the minimum amount

1:42:13.500 --> 1:42:18.140
 of reused components that will create this molecule.

1:42:18.140 --> 1:42:19.660
 And it becomes difficult when you start

1:42:19.660 --> 1:42:23.700
 to look at a huge, huge molecules, arbitrarily large.

1:42:23.700 --> 1:42:25.100
 Cause I'm also like mapping this.

1:42:25.100 --> 1:42:28.740
 Can I think about this in complexity generally,

1:42:28.740 --> 1:42:30.780
 like looking at a cellular automata system

1:42:30.780 --> 1:42:33.020
 and saying like, what's the,

1:42:33.020 --> 1:42:35.580
 can this be used as a measure of complexity

1:42:35.580 --> 1:42:38.740
 for like a arbitrarily complicated system?

1:42:38.740 --> 1:42:40.380
 Yeah, I think it can.

1:42:40.380 --> 1:42:41.220
 It can.

1:42:41.220 --> 1:42:43.860
 And I think that the question is, and what's the benefit?

1:42:43.860 --> 1:42:46.540
 Cause there's plenty of, I mean,

1:42:46.540 --> 1:42:48.540
 in computer science and mathematics and in physics,

1:42:48.540 --> 1:42:51.540
 people have been really seriously studying complexity

1:42:51.540 --> 1:42:53.180
 for a long time.

1:42:53.180 --> 1:42:55.100
 And I think there's a really interesting problems

1:42:55.100 --> 1:42:58.540
 of where we course grade and we lose information.

1:42:58.540 --> 1:43:00.100
 And all assembly theory does really,

1:43:00.100 --> 1:43:03.180
 assembly theory just explains weak emergence.

1:43:03.180 --> 1:43:05.980
 And so what assembly theory says, look,

1:43:05.980 --> 1:43:08.900
 going from the atoms that interact,

1:43:08.900 --> 1:43:12.020
 those first replicators that build one another,

1:43:12.020 --> 1:43:14.900
 assembly at the minimal level just tells you evidence

1:43:14.900 --> 1:43:17.860
 that there's been replication and selection.

1:43:17.860 --> 1:43:20.380
 And I think the more selected something is,

1:43:20.380 --> 1:43:22.460
 the higher the assembly.

1:43:22.460 --> 1:43:25.540
 And so we were able to start to know

1:43:25.540 --> 1:43:27.100
 how to look for selection in the universe.

1:43:27.100 --> 1:43:28.380
 If you go to the moon,

1:43:28.380 --> 1:43:30.100
 there's nothing a very high assembly on the moon

1:43:30.100 --> 1:43:32.900
 except the human artifacts we've left there.

1:43:32.900 --> 1:43:36.020
 So again, let's go back to the sandbox.

1:43:36.020 --> 1:43:37.820
 In assembly theory says,

1:43:37.820 --> 1:43:40.020
 if all the sand grains could stick together,

1:43:40.020 --> 1:43:42.540
 that's the infinite combinatorial explosion

1:43:42.540 --> 1:43:44.740
 in the universe, that should be the default.

1:43:44.740 --> 1:43:45.900
 We don't have that.

1:43:45.900 --> 1:43:48.580
 Now let's assemble sand grains together

1:43:48.580 --> 1:43:51.060
 and do them in every possible way.

1:43:51.060 --> 1:43:54.700
 So we have a series of minimal operations

1:43:54.700 --> 1:43:56.180
 that can move the sand together.

1:43:56.180 --> 1:43:57.860
 But all that doesn't exist either.

1:43:57.860 --> 1:43:59.900
 Now, because we have specific memory where we say,

1:43:59.900 --> 1:44:01.780
 well, we're gonna put three sand grains in line

1:44:01.780 --> 1:44:03.900
 or four and make a cross or a triangle

1:44:03.900 --> 1:44:05.420
 or something unsymmetrical.

1:44:05.420 --> 1:44:06.620
 And once we've made the triangle

1:44:06.620 --> 1:44:08.380
 and the unsymmetrical thing, we remember that,

1:44:08.380 --> 1:44:10.900
 we can use it again, cause on that causal chain.

1:44:10.900 --> 1:44:12.420
 So what assembly theory allows you to do

1:44:12.420 --> 1:44:14.620
 is go to the actual object that you exist,

1:44:14.620 --> 1:44:16.060
 you find in space.

1:44:16.060 --> 1:44:18.980
 And actually the way you get there is by disassembling.

1:44:18.980 --> 1:44:23.340
 It's disassembly theory works by disassembling objects

1:44:23.340 --> 1:44:27.660
 you have and understanding the steps to create them.

1:44:27.660 --> 1:44:30.140
 And it works for molecules beautifully

1:44:30.140 --> 1:44:31.740
 cause you just break bonds.

1:44:31.740 --> 1:44:33.860
 But like you said, it's very difficult.

1:44:33.860 --> 1:44:35.580
 It's a difficult problem to figure out

1:44:35.580 --> 1:44:36.580
 how to break them apart.

1:44:36.580 --> 1:44:37.580
 For molecules, it's easy.

1:44:37.580 --> 1:44:40.780
 If you just keep low enough in molecular weight space,

1:44:40.780 --> 1:44:41.700
 it's good enough.

1:44:41.700 --> 1:44:43.820
 So it's a complete theory.

1:44:43.820 --> 1:44:45.300
 When we start to think about objects,

1:44:45.300 --> 1:44:46.940
 we can start to assign,

1:44:46.940 --> 1:44:49.020
 we can start to think about things at different levels,

1:44:49.020 --> 1:44:51.540
 different atoms, what you assign as your atom.

1:44:51.540 --> 1:44:54.620
 So in a molecule, the atom, this is really confusing

1:44:54.620 --> 1:44:57.260
 cause the word atom, I mean smallest breakable part.

1:44:57.260 --> 1:44:59.700
 So in a molecule, the atom is the bond

1:44:59.700 --> 1:45:02.420
 cause you break bonds, not atoms, right?

1:45:02.420 --> 1:45:06.100
 So in a car, the atom might be, I don't know,

1:45:06.100 --> 1:45:09.780
 a small amount of iron or the smallest reusable part,

1:45:09.780 --> 1:45:13.460
 a rivet, a piece of plastic or something.

1:45:13.460 --> 1:45:14.740
 So you gotta be really careful.

1:45:14.740 --> 1:45:18.460
 In a microprocessor, the atoms might be transistors.

1:45:18.460 --> 1:45:23.460
 And so the amount of assembly that something has

1:45:23.580 --> 1:45:26.620
 is a function, you have to look at the atom level.

1:45:26.620 --> 1:45:28.180
 What are your parts?

1:45:28.180 --> 1:45:29.020
 What are you counting?

1:45:29.020 --> 1:45:30.780
 That's one of the things you get to choose.

1:45:30.780 --> 1:45:32.740
 What is, at what scale is the atom?

1:45:32.740 --> 1:45:34.740
 What is the minimal thing?

1:45:34.740 --> 1:45:36.740
 I mean, there's a huge amounts of trade offs

1:45:36.740 --> 1:45:39.700
 in when you approach a system and try to analyze.

1:45:39.700 --> 1:45:41.340
 Like if you approach Earth,

1:45:41.340 --> 1:45:43.820
 you're an alien civilization trying to study Earth,

1:45:43.820 --> 1:45:45.740
 what is the atom for trying to measure

1:45:45.740 --> 1:45:48.380
 the complexity of life?

1:45:48.380 --> 1:45:50.540
 Is it, are humans the atoms?

1:45:50.540 --> 1:45:53.500
 I would say to start with, you just use molecules.

1:45:53.500 --> 1:45:56.020
 I can say for sure, if there are molecules

1:45:56.020 --> 1:45:58.220
 of sufficient complexity on Earth,

1:45:58.220 --> 1:45:59.820
 then I know that life has made them.

1:45:59.820 --> 1:46:01.380
 And then go further and show technology.

1:46:01.380 --> 1:46:03.860
 There are molecules that exist on Earth

1:46:03.860 --> 1:46:06.020
 that are not possible even by biology.

1:46:06.020 --> 1:46:07.180
 You needed technology

1:46:07.180 --> 1:46:09.700
 and you needed microprocessors to get there.

1:46:09.700 --> 1:46:11.420
 So that's really cool.

1:46:11.420 --> 1:46:14.620
 And that there's a correlation between that,

1:46:14.620 --> 1:46:18.580
 between the coolness of that and assembly number,

1:46:18.580 --> 1:46:19.700
 whatever the measure.

1:46:19.700 --> 1:46:21.580
 What's the, what would you call the measure?

1:46:21.580 --> 1:46:22.500
 Assembly index.

1:46:22.500 --> 1:46:23.340
 Yeah, assembly index.

1:46:23.340 --> 1:46:25.660
 So there are three kind of fundamental

1:46:25.660 --> 1:46:26.700
 kind of labels we have.

1:46:26.700 --> 1:46:28.900
 So there's the quantity of assembly

1:46:28.900 --> 1:46:31.140
 and the assembly, so if you have a box,

1:46:31.140 --> 1:46:32.540
 let's just have a box of molecules.

1:46:32.540 --> 1:46:34.220
 So I'm gonna have my box.

1:46:34.220 --> 1:46:36.540
 We count the number of identical molecules

1:46:36.540 --> 1:46:37.980
 and then we chop each molecule up

1:46:37.980 --> 1:46:40.500
 in an individual molecule class

1:46:40.500 --> 1:46:42.260
 and calculate the assembly number.

1:46:42.260 --> 1:46:45.740
 So basically you then have a function

1:46:45.740 --> 1:46:49.420
 that sums over all the molecules for each assembly

1:46:49.420 --> 1:46:50.620
 and then you divide through.

1:46:50.620 --> 1:46:52.340
 So you make it divide through

1:46:52.340 --> 1:46:54.220
 by the number of molecules.

1:46:54.220 --> 1:46:56.180
 So that's the assembly index for the box?

1:46:56.180 --> 1:46:58.620
 So that will tell you the amount of assembly in the box.

1:46:58.620 --> 1:47:01.020
 So basically the assembly equation we come up with

1:47:01.020 --> 1:47:04.980
 is like basically the sum of e to the power

1:47:04.980 --> 1:47:07.420
 of the assembly index for molecule i

1:47:07.420 --> 1:47:10.540
 times the number of copies of the molecule i

1:47:10.540 --> 1:47:11.460
 and then you normalize.

1:47:11.460 --> 1:47:13.380
 So you sum them all up and then normalize.

1:47:13.380 --> 1:47:16.380
 So some boxes are gonna be more assembled than others.

1:47:16.380 --> 1:47:17.700
 Yeah, that's what they tell me.

1:47:17.700 --> 1:47:19.900
 So if you were to look at me as a box,

1:47:19.900 --> 1:47:23.820
 so say I'm a box, am I assembling my parts?

1:47:23.820 --> 1:47:25.620
 In terms of like, how do you know,

1:47:25.620 --> 1:47:27.020
 what's my assembly index?

1:47:27.020 --> 1:47:28.740
 So I've been gentle.

1:47:28.740 --> 1:47:30.940
 So let's just, we'll talk about the molecules in you.

1:47:30.940 --> 1:47:34.540
 So let's just take a pile of sand the same way as you

1:47:34.540 --> 1:47:39.540
 and I would take you and just cut up all the molecules.

1:47:40.140 --> 1:47:42.580
 I mean, and look at the number of copies

1:47:42.580 --> 1:47:43.900
 and assembly number.

1:47:43.900 --> 1:47:46.020
 So in sand, let's say there's probably gonna be

1:47:46.020 --> 1:47:48.340
 nothing more than assembly number of two or three,

1:47:48.340 --> 1:47:51.980
 but there might be trillions and trillions of sand grains.

1:47:51.980 --> 1:47:53.860
 In your body, there might be,

1:47:53.860 --> 1:47:56.180
 the assembly number is gonna be higher,

1:47:56.180 --> 1:47:58.340
 but there might not be as quite as many copies

1:47:58.340 --> 1:48:01.220
 because the molecular weight is higher.

1:48:01.220 --> 1:48:03.020
 So you do wanna average it out.

1:48:03.020 --> 1:48:04.340
 You can average, you do average it.

1:48:04.340 --> 1:48:07.140
 I'm not defined by the most impressive molecules.

1:48:07.140 --> 1:48:08.700
 No, no, you're an average in your volume.

1:48:08.700 --> 1:48:10.500
 Well, I mean, we're just working this out,

1:48:10.500 --> 1:48:13.500
 but what's really cool is you're gonna have

1:48:13.500 --> 1:48:15.140
 a really high assembly.

1:48:15.140 --> 1:48:16.700
 The sand will have a very low assembly.

1:48:16.700 --> 1:48:19.500
 Your causal power is much higher.

1:48:19.500 --> 1:48:22.940
 You get to make decisions, you're alive, you're aspiring.

1:48:22.940 --> 1:48:26.580
 Assembly says something about causal power in the universe.

1:48:26.580 --> 1:48:28.860
 And that's not supposed to exist

1:48:28.860 --> 1:48:30.580
 because physicists don't accept

1:48:30.580 --> 1:48:33.140
 that causation exists at the bottom.

1:48:33.140 --> 1:48:34.580
 So I understand at the chemical level

1:48:34.580 --> 1:48:37.660
 why the assembly causes causation.

1:48:37.660 --> 1:48:38.580
 Why is it causation?

1:48:38.580 --> 1:48:40.940
 Because it's capturing the memory.

1:48:40.940 --> 1:48:41.780
 Exactly.

1:48:41.780 --> 1:48:45.660
 Capturing memory, but there's not an action to it.

1:48:45.660 --> 1:48:50.660
 So I'm trying to see how it leads to life.

1:48:51.380 --> 1:48:52.980
 Well, it's what life does.

1:48:52.980 --> 1:48:55.620
 So I think it's, we don't know.

1:48:55.620 --> 1:48:57.300
 So. Yeah, that's a good question.

1:48:57.300 --> 1:49:00.100
 What is life versus what does life do?

1:49:00.100 --> 1:49:02.460
 Yeah, so that's, this is the definition of life.

1:49:02.460 --> 1:49:04.460
 The only definition we need, right?

1:49:04.460 --> 1:49:05.300
 The assembly index.

1:49:05.300 --> 1:49:09.900
 It's basically that life is able to create objects

1:49:09.900 --> 1:49:14.020
 in abundance that are so complex,

1:49:14.020 --> 1:49:15.700
 the assembly number is so high,

1:49:15.700 --> 1:49:18.700
 they can't possibly be formed in an environment

1:49:18.700 --> 1:49:20.300
 where there's just random interactions.

1:49:20.300 --> 1:49:21.140
 Yeah.

1:49:21.140 --> 1:49:24.860
 So suddenly you can put life on a scale.

1:49:24.860 --> 1:49:27.860
 And then life doesn't exist actually in that camp.

1:49:27.860 --> 1:49:30.300
 It's just how evolved you are.

1:49:30.300 --> 1:49:33.100
 And you as an object,

1:49:33.100 --> 1:49:35.660
 because you have incredible causal power,

1:49:35.660 --> 1:49:38.140
 you could go and, you can go and, you know,

1:49:39.660 --> 1:49:43.660
 launch rockets or build cars or create drugs,

1:49:43.660 --> 1:49:46.340
 or, you know, you can do so many things.

1:49:46.340 --> 1:49:49.020
 You can build stuff, build more artifacts

1:49:49.020 --> 1:49:52.340
 that show that you have had causal power.

1:49:52.340 --> 1:49:55.340
 And that causal power was this kind of a lineage.

1:49:55.340 --> 1:49:57.860
 And I think that over time,

1:49:57.860 --> 1:50:02.580
 I've been realizing that physics as a discipline

1:50:02.580 --> 1:50:04.900
 has a number of problems associated with it.

1:50:04.900 --> 1:50:07.300
 Me as a chemist, it's kind of interesting

1:50:07.300 --> 1:50:10.340
 that assembly theory, and I'm really, you know,

1:50:10.340 --> 1:50:13.460
 I want to maintain some credibility in the physicists eyes,

1:50:13.460 --> 1:50:15.260
 but I have to push them because they,

1:50:15.260 --> 1:50:17.980
 physics is a really good discipline.

1:50:17.980 --> 1:50:20.060
 It's reduced the number,

1:50:20.060 --> 1:50:22.260
 physics is about reducing the belief system,

1:50:22.260 --> 1:50:24.740
 but they're down to some things in their belief system,

1:50:24.740 --> 1:50:27.780
 which is kind of really makes me kind of grumpy.

1:50:27.780 --> 1:50:29.620
 Number one is requiring order

1:50:29.620 --> 1:50:31.020
 at the beginning of the universe magically.

1:50:31.020 --> 1:50:32.220
 We don't need that.

1:50:32.220 --> 1:50:34.020
 The second is the second law.

1:50:34.020 --> 1:50:36.740
 Well, we don't actually need that.

1:50:36.740 --> 1:50:37.580
 And I...

1:50:37.580 --> 1:50:39.180
 This is blasphemous.

1:50:39.180 --> 1:50:42.260
 Well, in a minute, I'll recover my career in a second.

1:50:42.260 --> 1:50:43.380
 Although I think the good,

1:50:43.380 --> 1:50:45.140
 the only good thing about being the regis chair

1:50:45.140 --> 1:50:47.860
 means I think there has to be an act of parliament to fire me.

1:50:47.860 --> 1:50:48.700
 Yeah.

1:50:48.700 --> 1:50:49.540
 Yeah.

1:50:49.540 --> 1:50:50.380
 Yeah.

1:50:50.380 --> 1:50:51.220
 Yeah.

1:50:51.220 --> 1:50:52.060
 Yeah.

1:50:52.060 --> 1:50:56.700
 But you can always go to Lee's Twitter and protest.

1:50:56.700 --> 1:50:58.620
 And I think the third thing is that,

1:50:58.620 --> 1:50:59.460
 so we've got, you know,

1:50:59.460 --> 1:51:02.540
 we've got the order at the beginning.

1:51:02.540 --> 1:51:03.380
 Second law.

1:51:03.380 --> 1:51:06.780
 The second law and the fact that causation is emergent,

1:51:06.780 --> 1:51:07.620
 right?

1:51:07.620 --> 1:51:09.060
 And that time is emergent.

1:51:09.060 --> 1:51:11.180
 John Carroll just turned off this program.

1:51:12.180 --> 1:51:13.860
 I think he believes that it's emergent.

1:51:13.860 --> 1:51:15.700
 So causation is not...

1:51:15.700 --> 1:51:17.860
 That's clearly incorrect

1:51:17.860 --> 1:51:19.620
 because we wouldn't exist otherwise.

1:51:19.620 --> 1:51:23.460
 So physicists have kind of got confused about time.

1:51:23.460 --> 1:51:25.580
 Time is a real thing.

1:51:25.580 --> 1:51:27.340
 Well, I mean, so look,

1:51:29.460 --> 1:51:31.140
 I'm very happy with the current description

1:51:31.140 --> 1:51:32.700
 of the universe as physics give me,

1:51:32.700 --> 1:51:33.980
 because I can do a lot of stuff, right?

1:51:33.980 --> 1:51:36.540
 I can go to the moon with Newtonian physics, I think,

1:51:36.540 --> 1:51:41.060
 and I can understand the orbit of Mercury with relativity.

1:51:41.060 --> 1:51:42.900
 And so, and I can build transistors

1:51:42.900 --> 1:51:43.940
 with quantum mechanics, right?

1:51:43.940 --> 1:51:45.740
 And I can do all this stuff.

1:51:45.740 --> 1:51:47.260
 So I'm not saying the physics is wrong.

1:51:47.260 --> 1:51:50.460
 I'm just saying, if we say that time is fundamental,

1:51:50.460 --> 1:51:52.940
 i.e. time is nonnegotiable, there's a global clock,

1:51:52.940 --> 1:51:56.620
 I don't need to require

1:51:56.620 --> 1:51:59.700
 that there's order been magically made in the past

1:51:59.700 --> 1:52:03.340
 because that asymmetry is built into the way the universe is.

1:52:05.460 --> 1:52:06.940
 So if time is fundamental,

1:52:06.940 --> 1:52:09.540
 I mean, you've been referring to this kind of

1:52:11.140 --> 1:52:13.900
 an interesting formulation of that is memory.

1:52:13.900 --> 1:52:14.740
 Yeah.

1:52:14.740 --> 1:52:18.940
 So time is hard to like put a finger on,

1:52:18.940 --> 1:52:20.580
 like what the hell are we talking about?

1:52:20.580 --> 1:52:21.740
 Well, it's just the direction,

1:52:21.740 --> 1:52:24.620
 but memory is a construction,

1:52:24.620 --> 1:52:26.660
 especially when you have like,

1:52:26.660 --> 1:52:28.980
 think about these local pockets of complexity,

1:52:28.980 --> 1:52:33.980
 these nonzero assembly index entities

1:52:34.020 --> 1:52:36.340
 that's being constructed and they remember.

1:52:37.260 --> 1:52:39.140
 Never forget molecules.

1:52:39.140 --> 1:52:41.900
 But remember, the thing is I invented assembly theory.

1:52:42.940 --> 1:52:44.420
 I'll tell you how I invented it.

1:52:44.420 --> 1:52:46.140
 When I was a kid, I mean, the thing is,

1:52:46.140 --> 1:52:48.300
 I keep making fun of myself to my research group.

1:52:48.300 --> 1:52:49.620
 I've only ever had one idea.

1:52:49.620 --> 1:52:52.500
 I keep exploring that idea over the 40 years or so

1:52:52.500 --> 1:52:53.740
 since I had the idea.

1:52:53.740 --> 1:52:54.580
 I used to be a...

1:52:54.580 --> 1:52:56.460
 Well, aren't you the idea that the universe had?

1:52:56.460 --> 1:52:58.500
 So it's very kind of hierarchical.

1:52:58.500 --> 1:52:59.340
 Anyway, go ahead.

1:52:59.340 --> 1:53:00.180
 I'm sorry.

1:53:00.180 --> 1:53:02.100
 That's very poetic.

1:53:02.100 --> 1:53:02.940
 Yeah.

1:53:02.940 --> 1:53:04.820
 So I think I came up with assembly theory

1:53:04.820 --> 1:53:06.100
 with the following idea.

1:53:06.100 --> 1:53:09.540
 When I was a kid, I was obsessed about survival kits.

1:53:09.540 --> 1:53:12.460
 What is the minimum stuff I would need

1:53:12.460 --> 1:53:14.020
 to basically replicate my reality?

1:53:14.020 --> 1:53:17.060
 And I love computers and I love technology

1:53:17.060 --> 1:53:18.340
 or what technology is gonna become.

1:53:18.340 --> 1:53:20.380
 So I imagined that I would have

1:53:20.380 --> 1:53:22.860
 basically this really big truck full of stuff.

1:53:22.860 --> 1:53:25.500
 And I thought, well, can I delete some of that stuff out?

1:53:25.500 --> 1:53:26.500
 Can I have a blueprint?

1:53:26.500 --> 1:53:29.500
 And then in the end, I kept making this smaller.

1:53:29.500 --> 1:53:32.220
 I got to maybe a half a truck and then to a suitcase.

1:53:32.220 --> 1:53:33.980
 And then I went, okay, well, screw it.

1:53:33.980 --> 1:53:37.580
 I wanna carry my entire technology in my pocket.

1:53:37.580 --> 1:53:38.620
 How do I do it?

1:53:38.620 --> 1:53:43.180
 And I'm not gonna launch into Steve Jobs and iPlayer.

1:53:43.180 --> 1:53:45.940
 I came up with a matchbox survival kit.

1:53:45.940 --> 1:53:47.260
 In that matchbox survival kit,

1:53:47.260 --> 1:53:48.540
 I would have the minimum stuff

1:53:48.540 --> 1:53:50.540
 that would allow me to interact the environment,

1:53:50.540 --> 1:53:54.260
 to build my shelter, to build a fishing rod,

1:53:54.260 --> 1:53:57.300
 to build a water purification system.

1:53:57.300 --> 1:53:59.460
 And it's kind of like, so what did I use in my box

1:53:59.460 --> 1:54:01.620
 to assemble in the environment,

1:54:01.620 --> 1:54:04.260
 to assemble, to assemble, to assemble?

1:54:04.260 --> 1:54:07.060
 And I realized I could make a causal chain

1:54:07.060 --> 1:54:08.180
 in my survival kit.

1:54:08.180 --> 1:54:10.220
 So I guess that's probably why I've been obsessed

1:54:10.220 --> 1:54:11.980
 with assembly theory for so long.

1:54:11.980 --> 1:54:16.980
 And I was just pre configured to find it somewhere.

1:54:17.580 --> 1:54:19.420
 And when I saw it in molecules,

1:54:19.420 --> 1:54:24.340
 I realized that the causal structure that we say emerges

1:54:24.340 --> 1:54:27.100
 and the physics kind of gets really stuck

1:54:27.100 --> 1:54:28.580
 because they're saying that time,

1:54:28.580 --> 1:54:29.740
 you can go backwards in time.

1:54:29.740 --> 1:54:32.140
 I mean, how do we let physicists get away

1:54:32.140 --> 1:54:34.340
 with the notion that we can go back in time

1:54:34.340 --> 1:54:35.180
 and meet ourselves?

1:54:35.180 --> 1:54:40.180
 I mean, that's clearly a very hard thing

1:54:40.180 --> 1:54:45.180
 to allow, physicists would not let other sciences

1:54:45.580 --> 1:54:49.100
 get away with that kind of heresy, right?

1:54:49.100 --> 1:54:50.620
 So why are physicists allowed to get away with it?

1:54:50.620 --> 1:54:51.460
 Let's, let's.

1:54:51.460 --> 1:54:54.260
 So first of all, to push back, to play devil's advocate,

1:54:54.260 --> 1:54:58.300
 you are clearly married to the idea of memory.

1:54:58.300 --> 1:55:02.220
 You see in this, again, from Rick and Morty way,

1:55:02.220 --> 1:55:06.380
 you see, you have these deep dreams of the universe

1:55:06.380 --> 1:55:08.900
 that is writing the story through its memories,

1:55:08.900 --> 1:55:10.860
 through its chemical compounds

1:55:10.860 --> 1:55:12.460
 that are just building at top of each other.

1:55:12.460 --> 1:55:16.020
 And then they find useful components they can reuse.

1:55:16.020 --> 1:55:19.780
 And then the reused components create systems

1:55:19.780 --> 1:55:21.820
 that themselves are then reused

1:55:21.820 --> 1:55:24.060
 and all in this way, construct things.

1:55:24.060 --> 1:55:27.860
 But when you think of that as memory,

1:55:27.860 --> 1:55:31.940
 it seems like quite sad that you can walk that back.

1:55:31.940 --> 1:55:34.860
 But at the same time, it feels like that memory,

1:55:34.860 --> 1:55:37.060
 you can walk in both directions on that memory

1:55:37.060 --> 1:55:38.020
 in terms of time.

1:55:38.020 --> 1:55:39.580
 You could walk in both directions,

1:55:39.580 --> 1:55:42.060
 but I don't think that that makes any sense

1:55:42.060 --> 1:55:47.060
 because the problem that I have with time being reversible

1:55:50.060 --> 1:55:53.460
 is that, I mean, I'm just a, you know,

1:55:53.460 --> 1:55:55.220
 I'm a dumb experimental chemist, right?

1:55:55.220 --> 1:55:58.940
 So I love burning stuff, burning stuff and building stuff.

1:55:58.940 --> 1:56:01.220
 But when I think of reversible phenomena,

1:56:01.220 --> 1:56:02.260
 I imagine in my head,

1:56:02.260 --> 1:56:05.260
 I have to actually manufacture some time.

1:56:05.260 --> 1:56:08.180
 I have to borrow time from the universe to do that.

1:56:08.180 --> 1:56:10.100
 I can't, when anyone says,

1:56:10.100 --> 1:56:13.180
 let's imagine that we can go back in time or reversibility,

1:56:13.180 --> 1:56:14.020
 you can't do that.

1:56:14.020 --> 1:56:15.220
 You can't step out of time.

1:56:15.220 --> 1:56:17.060
 Time is nonnegotiable, it's happening.

1:56:17.060 --> 1:56:20.540
 No, but see, you're assuming that time is fundamental,

1:56:20.540 --> 1:56:23.780
 which most of us do when we go day to day,

1:56:23.780 --> 1:56:27.300
 but it takes a leap of wild imagination

1:56:27.300 --> 1:56:29.780
 to think that time is emergent.

1:56:29.780 --> 1:56:30.980
 No, time is not emergent.

1:56:30.980 --> 1:56:32.940
 Yeah, I mean, this is an argument we can have,

1:56:32.940 --> 1:56:35.940
 but I believe I can come up with an experiment.

1:56:35.940 --> 1:56:37.180
 An experiment that proves

1:56:37.180 --> 1:56:38.780
 that time cannot possibly be emergent.

1:56:38.780 --> 1:56:43.300
 An experiment that shows how assembly theory

1:56:43.300 --> 1:56:48.180
 kind of is the way that the universe produces selection

1:56:48.180 --> 1:56:50.700
 and that selection gives rise to life.

1:56:50.700 --> 1:56:53.420
 And also to say, well, hang on,

1:56:53.420 --> 1:56:55.340
 we could allow ourselves to have a theory

1:56:55.340 --> 1:56:59.220
 that requires us to have these statements to be possible.

1:56:59.220 --> 1:57:03.140
 Like we need to have order in the past,

1:57:03.140 --> 1:57:06.220
 or we can use the past hypothesis,

1:57:06.220 --> 1:57:10.980
 which is order in the past, but as well, okay.

1:57:10.980 --> 1:57:12.820
 And we have to have an arrow of time.

1:57:12.820 --> 1:57:16.500
 We have to require that entropy increases.

1:57:16.500 --> 1:57:17.980
 And we have to say, and then we can say, look,

1:57:17.980 --> 1:57:21.700
 the universe is completely closed and there's no novelty

1:57:21.700 --> 1:57:23.940
 or that novelty is predetermined.

1:57:23.940 --> 1:57:26.420
 What I'm saying is very, very important

1:57:26.420 --> 1:57:28.660
 that time is fundamental, which means,

1:57:28.660 --> 1:57:30.060
 if you think about it,

1:57:30.060 --> 1:57:32.660
 the universe becomes more and more novel each step.

1:57:32.660 --> 1:57:33.940
 It generates there's more states

1:57:33.940 --> 1:57:35.860
 in the next step than it was before.

1:57:35.860 --> 1:57:37.580
 So that means bigger search.

1:57:37.580 --> 1:57:39.460
 So what I'm saying is that the universe

1:57:39.460 --> 1:57:41.660
 wasn't capable of consciousness at day one,

1:57:43.220 --> 1:57:45.780
 actually, because it didn't have enough states.

1:57:45.780 --> 1:57:48.780
 But today the universe is, so it's like how?

1:57:48.780 --> 1:57:51.580
 All right, all right, hold on a second.

1:57:51.580 --> 1:57:54.060
 Now we've pissed off the panpsychist too, okay.

1:57:55.700 --> 1:57:57.580
 No, this is brilliant, sorry.

1:57:57.580 --> 1:58:00.220
 Part of me is just joking, having fun with this thing,

1:58:00.220 --> 1:58:02.500
 but because you're saying a lot of brilliant stuff

1:58:02.500 --> 1:58:05.660
 and I'm trying to slow it down before my brain explodes.

1:58:05.660 --> 1:58:08.100
 So, because I want to break apart

1:58:08.100 --> 1:58:10.340
 some of the fascinating things you're saying.

1:58:10.340 --> 1:58:14.700
 So novelty, novelty is increasing in the universe

1:58:14.700 --> 1:58:16.980
 because the number of states is increasing.

1:58:16.980 --> 1:58:18.460
 What do you mean by states?

1:58:18.460 --> 1:58:20.780
 So I think the physicists almost got everything right.

1:58:20.780 --> 1:58:22.940
 I can't fault them at all.

1:58:22.940 --> 1:58:24.460
 I just think there's a little bit of dogma.

1:58:24.460 --> 1:58:25.820
 I'm just trying to play devil's advocate.

1:58:25.820 --> 1:58:28.780
 I'm very happy to be entirely wrong on this, right?

1:58:28.780 --> 1:58:31.060
 I'm not right on many things at all,

1:58:31.060 --> 1:58:34.060
 but if I can make less assumptions

1:58:34.060 --> 1:58:35.940
 about the universe with this,

1:58:35.940 --> 1:58:38.100
 then potentially that's a more powerful way

1:58:38.100 --> 1:58:39.740
 of looking at things.

1:58:39.740 --> 1:58:41.820
 If you think of time as fundamental,

1:58:41.820 --> 1:58:43.460
 you can make less assumptions overall.

1:58:43.460 --> 1:58:45.740
 Exactly, if time is fundamental,

1:58:45.740 --> 1:58:48.020
 I don't need to add on a magical second law

1:58:48.020 --> 1:58:49.500
 because the second law comes out of the fact

1:58:49.500 --> 1:58:52.700
 the universe is actually, there's more states available.

1:58:52.700 --> 1:58:54.580
 I mean, we might even be able to do weird things

1:58:54.580 --> 1:58:55.900
 like dark energy in the universe

1:58:55.900 --> 1:58:58.660
 might actually just be time, right?

1:58:58.660 --> 1:59:00.940
 Yeah, but then you have to still have to explain

1:59:00.940 --> 1:59:02.540
 why time is fundamental,

1:59:02.540 --> 1:59:04.460
 because I can give you one explanation

1:59:04.460 --> 1:59:07.020
 that's simpler than time and say God.

1:59:07.020 --> 1:59:08.700
 You know, like just because it's simple

1:59:08.700 --> 1:59:12.620
 doesn't mean it's, okay, you still have to explain God

1:59:12.620 --> 1:59:14.220
 and you still have to explain time.

1:59:14.220 --> 1:59:15.580
 Like why is it fundamental?

1:59:15.580 --> 1:59:18.020
 So let's just say existence is default,

1:59:18.020 --> 1:59:19.580
 which means time is the default.

1:59:19.580 --> 1:59:22.020
 So how did you go from the existence

1:59:22.020 --> 1:59:24.940
 of the time to the default? Well, we exist, right?

1:59:24.940 --> 1:59:26.980
 So let's just be very.

1:59:26.980 --> 1:59:28.940
 We're yet to talk about what exist means.

1:59:28.940 --> 1:59:30.340
 All right, let's go all the way back.

1:59:30.340 --> 1:59:31.180
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

1:59:31.180 --> 1:59:32.540
 I think it's very poetic and beautiful

1:59:32.540 --> 1:59:34.180
 what you're weaving into this.

1:59:34.180 --> 1:59:37.220
 I don't think this conversation is even about the assembly,

1:59:38.180 --> 1:59:41.100
 which is fascinating and we'll keep mentioning it

1:59:41.100 --> 1:59:42.980
 in the index on this idea,

1:59:42.980 --> 1:59:46.940
 that I don't think is necessarily connected to time.

1:59:46.940 --> 1:59:49.180
 Oh, I think it is deeply connected.

1:59:49.180 --> 1:59:50.260
 I can't explain it yet.

1:59:50.260 --> 1:59:52.580
 So you don't think everything you've said

1:59:52.580 --> 1:59:56.100
 about assembly theory and assembly index

1:59:56.100 --> 1:59:58.620
 can still be correct even if time is emergent?

1:59:58.620 --> 2:00:01.660
 So yeah, right now, assembly theory appears to work.

2:00:01.660 --> 2:00:04.860
 I appear to be able to measure objects of high assembly

2:00:04.860 --> 2:00:06.660
 in a mass spectrometer and look at their abundance

2:00:06.660 --> 2:00:08.180
 and you know, all that's fine, right?

2:00:08.180 --> 2:00:10.540
 It's a nice, if nothing else, it's a nice way

2:00:10.540 --> 2:00:13.220
 of looking at how molecules can compress things.

2:00:14.420 --> 2:00:17.180
 Now, am I saying that a time has to be fundamental,

2:00:17.180 --> 2:00:18.740
 not emergent for assembly theory to work?

2:00:18.740 --> 2:00:23.300
 No, I think I'm saying that the universe,

2:00:23.300 --> 2:00:25.700
 it appears that the universe has many different ways

2:00:25.700 --> 2:00:26.540
 of using time.

2:00:26.540 --> 2:00:28.340
 You could have three different types of time.

2:00:28.340 --> 2:00:29.980
 You could just have time that's,

2:00:29.980 --> 2:00:30.820
 the way I would think of it,

2:00:30.820 --> 2:00:33.300
 if you want to hold onto emergent time,

2:00:33.300 --> 2:00:35.580
 I think that's fine, let's do that for a second.

2:00:35.580 --> 2:00:37.460
 Hold onto emergent time

2:00:37.460 --> 2:00:39.580
 and the universe is just doing its thing.

2:00:39.580 --> 2:00:41.980
 Then assembly time only exists when the universe

2:00:41.980 --> 2:00:43.780
 starts to write memories through bonds.

2:00:43.780 --> 2:00:45.660
 So let's just say there's rocks running around,

2:00:45.660 --> 2:00:49.340
 you know, when the bond happens and selection starts,

2:00:49.340 --> 2:00:54.340
 suddenly there are, the universe is remembering cause

2:00:54.580 --> 2:00:57.140
 in the past and those structures will have effects

2:00:57.140 --> 2:00:57.980
 in the future.

2:00:57.980 --> 2:01:00.740
 So suddenly a new type of time emerges at that point,

2:01:00.740 --> 2:01:02.340
 which has a direction.

2:01:02.340 --> 2:01:04.220
 And I think Sean Carroll at this point

2:01:04.220 --> 2:01:06.540
 might even turn the podcast back on and go,

2:01:06.540 --> 2:01:08.820
 okay, I can deal with that, that's fine.

2:01:08.820 --> 2:01:10.940
 But I'm just basically trying to condense the conversation,

2:01:10.940 --> 2:01:13.060
 say, hey, let's just have time fundamental

2:01:13.060 --> 2:01:14.940
 and see how that screws with people's minds.

2:01:14.940 --> 2:01:15.780
 Why?

2:01:15.780 --> 2:01:17.700
 You're triggering people by saying fundamental.

2:01:17.700 --> 2:01:18.540
 Why not?

2:01:18.540 --> 2:01:19.860
 Well, you just say, like, let's say.

2:01:19.860 --> 2:01:21.700
 Why am I, look, I'm walking through the wall.

2:01:21.700 --> 2:01:26.700
 Why should I grow up in a world where time,

2:01:26.980 --> 2:01:28.060
 I don't go back in time.

2:01:28.060 --> 2:01:30.740
 I don't meet myself in the past.

2:01:30.740 --> 2:01:32.780
 There are no one, there are no aliens coming

2:01:32.780 --> 2:01:34.580
 from the future, right?

2:01:34.580 --> 2:01:35.420
 You know, it's just like.

2:01:35.420 --> 2:01:38.660
 No, no, no, but that's not, no, no, no, hold on a second.

2:01:38.660 --> 2:01:41.780
 That's like saying we're talking about biology

2:01:41.780 --> 2:01:44.140
 or like evolutionary psychology

2:01:44.140 --> 2:01:46.260
 and you're saying, okay, let's just assume

2:01:46.260 --> 2:01:48.540
 that clothing is fundamental.

2:01:48.540 --> 2:01:50.380
 People wearing clothes is fundamental.

2:01:50.380 --> 2:01:52.340
 It's like, no, no, no, wait a minute.

2:01:52.340 --> 2:01:55.700
 You can't, like, I think you're gonna get in a lot of trouble

2:01:55.700 --> 2:01:57.620
 if you assume time is fundamental.

2:01:57.620 --> 2:01:58.460
 Why?

2:01:58.460 --> 2:02:00.060
 Give me one reason why I'm getting into trouble

2:02:00.060 --> 2:02:01.340
 with time being fundamental.

2:02:01.340 --> 2:02:04.340
 Because you might not understand

2:02:04.340 --> 2:02:08.100
 the origins of this memory that might be deeper.

2:02:08.100 --> 2:02:11.180
 Like this memory, that could be a thing

2:02:11.180 --> 2:02:14.860
 that's explaining the construction of these

2:02:14.860 --> 2:02:19.260
 higher complexities better than just saying

2:02:19.260 --> 2:02:23.740
 it's a search, it's chemicals doing a search

2:02:23.740 --> 2:02:28.740
 for reusable structures that they can like

2:02:30.060 --> 2:02:32.700
 then use as bricks to build a house.

2:02:32.700 --> 2:02:34.420
 Okay, so I accept that.

2:02:34.420 --> 2:02:37.900
 So let's go back a second because it's a kind of,

2:02:37.900 --> 2:02:40.700
 I wanted to drop the time bomb at this part

2:02:40.700 --> 2:02:42.180
 because I think we can carry on discussing it

2:02:42.180 --> 2:02:45.620
 for many, many, many, many, many days, many months.

2:02:46.700 --> 2:02:50.900
 But I'm happy to accept that it might be wrong.

2:02:50.900 --> 2:02:53.820
 But what I would like to do is imagine a universe

2:02:53.820 --> 2:02:56.580
 where time is fundamental and time is emergent

2:02:56.580 --> 2:03:00.340
 and ask, let's just then talk about causation

2:03:00.340 --> 2:03:02.900
 because physicists require that causation.

2:03:02.900 --> 2:03:04.420
 So this is where I'm gonna go.

2:03:04.420 --> 2:03:08.420
 Causation emerges and it doesn't exist at the micro scale.

2:03:08.420 --> 2:03:09.900
 Well, that clearly is wrong

2:03:09.900 --> 2:03:12.220
 because if causation has to emerge at the macro scale,

2:03:12.220 --> 2:03:13.660
 life cannot emerge.

2:03:13.660 --> 2:03:15.180
 So how does life emerge?

2:03:15.180 --> 2:03:17.940
 Life requires molecules to bump into each other,

2:03:17.940 --> 2:03:20.580
 produce replicators, those replicators

2:03:20.580 --> 2:03:21.860
 need to produce polymers.

2:03:21.860 --> 2:03:24.620
 There needs to be cause and effect at the molecular level.

2:03:24.620 --> 2:03:26.540
 There needs to be an agardic, non agardic

2:03:26.540 --> 2:03:29.620
 to an agardic transition at some point.

2:03:29.620 --> 2:03:34.620
 And those replicators have consequence,

2:03:35.260 --> 2:03:37.500
 material consequence in the universe.

2:03:37.500 --> 2:03:39.700
 Physicists just say, oh, you know what?

2:03:39.700 --> 2:03:42.460
 I'm gonna have a bunch of particles in a box.

2:03:42.460 --> 2:03:44.820
 I'm gonna think about it in a Newtonian way

2:03:44.820 --> 2:03:48.020
 and a quantum way and I'll add on an arrow of time

2:03:48.020 --> 2:03:49.260
 so I can label things

2:03:50.140 --> 2:03:51.820
 and causation will happen magically later.

2:03:51.820 --> 2:03:52.660
 Well, how?

2:03:52.660 --> 2:03:55.780
 Explain causation and they can't.

2:03:55.780 --> 2:03:58.540
 The only way I can reconcile causation

2:03:58.540 --> 2:04:00.620
 is having a fundamental time

2:04:00.620 --> 2:04:03.260
 because this allows me to have a deterministic universe

2:04:03.260 --> 2:04:05.500
 that creates novelty.

2:04:05.500 --> 2:04:08.300
 And there's so many things to unpack here

2:04:08.300 --> 2:04:09.780
 but let's go back to the point.

2:04:09.780 --> 2:04:12.580
 You said, can assembly theory work with emergent time?

2:04:12.580 --> 2:04:16.540
 Sure it can, but it doesn't give me a deep satisfaction

2:04:16.540 --> 2:04:21.060
 about how causation and assembly gives rise

2:04:21.060 --> 2:04:24.620
 to these objects that move through time and space.

2:04:24.620 --> 2:04:27.180
 And again, what am I saying to bring it back?

2:04:27.180 --> 2:04:31.260
 I can say without fear, take this water bottle

2:04:31.260 --> 2:04:32.100
 and look at this water bottle

2:04:32.100 --> 2:04:32.940
 and look at the features on it.

2:04:32.940 --> 2:04:35.780
 There's writing, you've got a load of them.

2:04:35.780 --> 2:04:38.620
 I know that causal structures gave rise to this.

2:04:38.620 --> 2:04:40.860
 In fact, I'm not looking at just one water bottle here.

2:04:40.860 --> 2:04:42.180
 I'm looking at every water bottle

2:04:42.180 --> 2:04:44.540
 that's ever been conceived of by humanity.

2:04:44.540 --> 2:04:46.980
 This here is a special object.

2:04:46.980 --> 2:04:48.700
 In fact, Leibniz knew this.

2:04:48.700 --> 2:04:52.060
 Leibniz who was at the same time of Newton,

2:04:52.060 --> 2:04:53.220
 he kind of got stuck.

2:04:53.220 --> 2:04:56.020
 I think Leibniz actually invented assembly theory.

2:04:56.020 --> 2:04:58.660
 He gave soul, the soul that you see in objects

2:04:58.660 --> 2:05:01.100
 wasn't the mystical soul, it is assembly.

2:05:01.100 --> 2:05:03.980
 It is the fact there's been a history of objects related

2:05:03.980 --> 2:05:06.780
 and without the object in the past,

2:05:06.780 --> 2:05:08.380
 this object wouldn't exist.

2:05:08.380 --> 2:05:12.660
 There is a lineage and there is conserved structures,

2:05:12.660 --> 2:05:14.780
 causal structures have given rise to those.

2:05:17.060 --> 2:05:17.900
 Fair enough.

2:05:17.900 --> 2:05:20.340
 And you're saying it's just a simpler view

2:05:20.340 --> 2:05:23.300
 if time is fundamental.

2:05:23.300 --> 2:05:25.700
 And it shakes the physicist's cage a bit, right?

2:05:25.700 --> 2:05:27.880
 Because I'm gonna say, but I think that.

2:05:29.100 --> 2:05:32.500
 I just enjoy the fact that physicists are in cages.

2:05:32.500 --> 2:05:35.580
 I think that, I mean, I would say that, you know,

2:05:35.580 --> 2:05:37.940
 Lee Smolin, I don't want to speak for Lee.

2:05:37.940 --> 2:05:39.940
 I mean, I'm talking to Lee about this.

2:05:39.940 --> 2:05:41.820
 I think Lee also is an agreement

2:05:41.820 --> 2:05:43.740
 that time has to be fundamental,

2:05:43.740 --> 2:05:45.180
 but I think he goes further.

2:05:45.180 --> 2:05:46.860
 You know, even in space,

2:05:46.860 --> 2:05:49.940
 I don't think you can go back to the same place in space.

2:05:49.940 --> 2:05:51.340
 I've been to Austin a few times now.

2:05:51.340 --> 2:05:54.100
 This is my, I think third time I've been to Austin.

2:05:54.100 --> 2:05:55.420
 Is Austin in the same place?

2:05:55.420 --> 2:05:58.460
 No, the solar system is moving through space.

2:05:59.740 --> 2:06:01.900
 I'm not back in the same space.

2:06:01.900 --> 2:06:02.960
 Locally I am.

2:06:03.860 --> 2:06:06.300
 Every event in the universe is unique.

2:06:07.780 --> 2:06:08.780
 In space.

2:06:08.780 --> 2:06:09.620
 And time.

2:06:09.620 --> 2:06:10.580
 And time.

2:06:10.580 --> 2:06:13.220
 Doesn't mean we can't go back though.

2:06:13.220 --> 2:06:17.220
 I mean, you know, let's just, you know,

2:06:17.220 --> 2:06:20.860
 rest this conversation, which was beautiful,

2:06:20.860 --> 2:06:22.540
 with a quote from the Rolling Stones

2:06:22.540 --> 2:06:25.220
 that you can't always get what you want,

2:06:25.220 --> 2:06:27.780
 which is you want time to be fundamental,

2:06:27.780 --> 2:06:30.060
 but if you try, you'll get what you need,

2:06:30.060 --> 2:06:32.120
 which is assembly theory.

2:06:32.120 --> 2:06:34.300
 Okay, let me ask you about,

2:06:34.300 --> 2:06:36.700
 continue talking about complexity,

2:06:36.700 --> 2:06:41.700
 and to clarify with this beautiful theory of yours

2:06:42.140 --> 2:06:43.660
 that you're developing,

2:06:43.660 --> 2:06:45.300
 and I'm sure we'll continue developing

2:06:45.300 --> 2:06:48.280
 both in the lab and in theory.

2:06:49.720 --> 2:06:52.220
 Yeah, it can't be said enough,

2:06:52.220 --> 2:06:56.020
 just the ideas you're playing with in your head are just,

2:06:56.020 --> 2:06:58.100
 and we've been talking about are just beautiful.

2:06:58.100 --> 2:07:01.100
 So if we talk about complexity a little bit more generally,

2:07:02.540 --> 2:07:05.700
 maybe in an admiring romantic way,

2:07:05.700 --> 2:07:09.180
 how does complexity emerge from simple rules?

2:07:09.180 --> 2:07:11.260
 The why, the how.

2:07:11.260 --> 2:07:14.980
 Okay, the nice algorithm of assembly is there.

2:07:14.980 --> 2:07:17.420
 I would say that the problem I have right now is,

2:07:17.420 --> 2:07:20.280
 I mean, you're right, we can, about time as well.

2:07:20.280 --> 2:07:22.580
 The problem is I have this hammer called assembly,

2:07:22.580 --> 2:07:24.500
 and everything I see is a nail.

2:07:24.500 --> 2:07:27.460
 So now let's just apply it to all sorts of things.

2:07:27.460 --> 2:07:28.900
 We take the Bernard instability.

2:07:28.900 --> 2:07:31.100
 The Bernard instability is you have oil,

2:07:32.300 --> 2:07:35.120
 if you heat up oil, let's say on a frying pan,

2:07:35.120 --> 2:07:37.480
 when you get convection, you get honeycomb patterns.

2:07:37.480 --> 2:07:40.580
 Take the formation of snowflakes, right?

2:07:40.580 --> 2:07:45.580
 Take the emergence of a tropical storm,

2:07:45.760 --> 2:07:47.580
 or the storm on Jupiter.

2:07:47.580 --> 2:07:50.100
 When people say, let's talk about complexity in general,

2:07:50.100 --> 2:07:51.600
 what they're saying is,

2:07:51.600 --> 2:07:54.400
 let's take this collection of objects

2:07:54.400 --> 2:07:56.880
 that are correlated in some way,

2:07:56.880 --> 2:08:00.300
 and try and work out how many moving parts there are,

2:08:00.300 --> 2:08:02.940
 how this got, how this exists.

2:08:02.940 --> 2:08:04.820
 So what people have been doing for a very long time

2:08:04.820 --> 2:08:09.300
 is taking complexity and counting what they've lost,

2:08:09.300 --> 2:08:11.140
 calculating the entropy.

2:08:11.140 --> 2:08:13.900
 And the reason why I'm pushing very hard on assembly

2:08:13.900 --> 2:08:16.380
 is entropy tells you how much you've lost.

2:08:16.380 --> 2:08:18.800
 It doesn't tell you the microstates are gone.

2:08:18.800 --> 2:08:21.740
 But if you embrace the bottom up with assembly,

2:08:21.740 --> 2:08:26.340
 those states, and you then understand the causal chain

2:08:26.340 --> 2:08:28.740
 that gives rise to the emergence.

2:08:28.740 --> 2:08:31.500
 So what I think assembly will help us do

2:08:31.500 --> 2:08:34.340
 is understand weak emergence at the very least,

2:08:34.340 --> 2:08:39.340
 and maybe allow us to crack open complexity in a new way.

2:08:39.720 --> 2:08:42.780
 And I've been fascinated with complexity theory

2:08:42.780 --> 2:08:43.580
 for many years.

2:08:43.580 --> 2:08:46.680
 I mean, as soon as I could,

2:08:46.680 --> 2:08:48.500
 I learned of the Mandelbrot set,

2:08:48.500 --> 2:08:52.660
 and I could just type it up in my computer and run it,

2:08:52.660 --> 2:08:55.800
 and just show it and see it kind of unfold.

2:08:55.800 --> 2:08:58.820
 It was just this kind of,

2:08:58.820 --> 2:09:01.440
 this mathematical reality that existed in front of me,

2:09:01.440 --> 2:09:03.980
 I just found incredible.

2:09:03.980 --> 2:09:07.100
 But then I realized that actually we were cheating.

2:09:07.100 --> 2:09:09.500
 We're putting in the boundary conditions all the time.

2:09:09.500 --> 2:09:11.500
 We're putting in information.

2:09:11.500 --> 2:09:13.620
 And so when people talk to me

2:09:13.620 --> 2:09:16.060
 about the complexity of things,

2:09:16.060 --> 2:09:18.700
 I say, but relative what, how do you measure them?

2:09:18.700 --> 2:09:23.540
 So my attempt, my small attempt, naive attempt,

2:09:23.540 --> 2:09:25.420
 because there's many greater minds than mine

2:09:25.420 --> 2:09:27.500
 on the planet right now thinking about this properly.

2:09:27.500 --> 2:09:29.860
 And you've had some of them on the podcast, right?

2:09:29.860 --> 2:09:31.740
 Just absolutely fantastic.

2:09:33.100 --> 2:09:35.620
 But I'm wondering if we might be able to reformat

2:09:35.620 --> 2:09:39.880
 the way we would explore algorithmic complexity

2:09:39.880 --> 2:09:41.100
 using assembly.

2:09:41.100 --> 2:09:45.260
 What's the minimum number of constraints we need

2:09:45.260 --> 2:09:47.860
 in our system for this to unfold?

2:09:47.860 --> 2:09:50.860
 So whether it's like, if you take some particles

2:09:50.860 --> 2:09:52.620
 and put them in a box,

2:09:52.620 --> 2:09:55.420
 at a certain box size, you get quasi crystallinity

2:09:55.420 --> 2:09:57.100
 coming out, right?

2:09:57.100 --> 2:10:00.540
 But that quite, that emergence, it's not magic.

2:10:00.540 --> 2:10:03.780
 It must come from the boundary conditions you put in.

2:10:03.780 --> 2:10:07.100
 So all I'm saying is a lot of the complexity that we see

2:10:07.100 --> 2:10:10.240
 is a direct read of the constraints we put in,

2:10:10.240 --> 2:10:11.980
 but we just don't understand.

2:10:11.980 --> 2:10:14.620
 So as I said earlier to the poor origin of life chemists,

2:10:14.620 --> 2:10:17.340
 you know, origin of life is a scam.

2:10:17.340 --> 2:10:20.220
 I would say lots of the complexity calculation theory

2:10:20.220 --> 2:10:21.660
 is a bit of a scam

2:10:21.660 --> 2:10:22.900
 because we put the constraints in,

2:10:22.900 --> 2:10:25.260
 but we don't count them correctly.

2:10:25.260 --> 2:10:26.140
 And I'm wondering if...

2:10:26.140 --> 2:10:28.340
 Oh, you're thinking and starting to drop

2:10:28.340 --> 2:10:31.780
 as assembly theory, assembly index

2:10:31.780 --> 2:10:33.300
 is a way to count to the constraints.

2:10:33.300 --> 2:10:34.140
 Yes, that's it.

2:10:34.140 --> 2:10:35.020
 That's all it is.

2:10:35.020 --> 2:10:36.780
 So assembly theory doesn't do,

2:10:36.780 --> 2:10:40.060
 doesn't lower any of the importance of complexity theory,

2:10:40.060 --> 2:10:42.180
 but it allows us to go across domains

2:10:42.180 --> 2:10:44.460
 and start to compare things,

2:10:44.460 --> 2:10:46.220
 compare the complexity of a molecule,

2:10:46.220 --> 2:10:49.700
 of a microprocessor, of the text you've writing,

2:10:49.700 --> 2:10:52.020
 of the music you may compose.

2:10:53.460 --> 2:10:55.220
 You've tweeted, quote,

2:10:55.220 --> 2:10:58.340
 "'Assembly theory explains why Nietzsche understood

2:10:58.340 --> 2:11:01.900
 we had limited freedom rather than radical freedom.'

2:11:01.900 --> 2:11:03.460
 So we've applied assembly theory

2:11:03.460 --> 2:11:06.060
 to cellular automata in life and chemistry.

2:11:07.380 --> 2:11:09.580
 What does Nietzsche have to do with assembly theory?

2:11:09.580 --> 2:11:12.040
 Oh, that gets me into free will and everything.

2:11:13.140 --> 2:11:14.540
 So let me say that again.

2:11:14.540 --> 2:11:16.620
 Assembly theory explains why Nietzsche understood

2:11:16.620 --> 2:11:20.380
 we had limited freedom rather than radical freedom.

2:11:20.380 --> 2:11:23.460
 Limited freedom, I suppose, is referring to the fact

2:11:23.460 --> 2:11:28.460
 that there's constraints or what is radical freedom?

2:11:28.780 --> 2:11:30.180
 What is freedom?

2:11:30.180 --> 2:11:33.420
 So Sartre was like believed in absolute freedom

2:11:34.340 --> 2:11:38.620
 and that he could do whatever he wanted in his imagination.

2:11:38.620 --> 2:11:41.800
 And Nietzsche understood that his freedom

2:11:41.800 --> 2:11:43.180
 was somewhat more limited.

2:11:44.100 --> 2:11:46.180
 And it kind of takes me back to this computer game

2:11:46.180 --> 2:11:47.940
 that I played when I was 10.

2:11:47.940 --> 2:11:49.980
 So I think it's called Dragon's Lair.

2:11:49.980 --> 2:11:51.780
 Okay.

2:11:51.780 --> 2:11:52.620
 Do you know Dragon's Lair?

2:11:52.620 --> 2:11:54.140
 I think I know Dragon's Lair, yeah.

2:11:54.140 --> 2:11:56.440
 Dragon's Lair, I knew I was being conned, right?

2:11:56.440 --> 2:11:57.820
 Dragon's Lair, when you play the game,

2:11:57.820 --> 2:11:59.060
 you're lucky that you grew up

2:11:59.060 --> 2:12:01.580
 in a basically procedurally generated world.

2:12:01.580 --> 2:12:03.200
 That was RPG a little bit.

2:12:03.200 --> 2:12:05.660
 No, it's like, is it turn based play?

2:12:05.660 --> 2:12:06.500
 Was it?

2:12:06.500 --> 2:12:07.320
 No.

2:12:07.320 --> 2:12:08.160
 It was a role playing game.

2:12:08.160 --> 2:12:09.000
 Role playing.

2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:11.660
 But really good graphics and one of the first laser disks.

2:12:11.660 --> 2:12:13.580
 And when you actually flick the stick,

2:12:13.580 --> 2:12:16.580
 you took, it's like it was like a graphical adventure game

2:12:16.580 --> 2:12:17.980
 with animation.

2:12:17.980 --> 2:12:18.820
 Yeah.

2:12:18.820 --> 2:12:19.980
 And when I played this game, I really, you know,

2:12:19.980 --> 2:12:22.060
 you could get through the game in 12 minutes

2:12:22.060 --> 2:12:23.900
 if you knew what you were doing without making mistakes,

2:12:23.900 --> 2:12:25.700
 just play the disk, play the disk, play a disk.

2:12:25.700 --> 2:12:27.460
 So it was just about timing.

2:12:27.460 --> 2:12:29.640
 And actually it was a complete fraud

2:12:29.640 --> 2:12:33.660
 because all the animation has been prerecorded on the disk.

2:12:33.660 --> 2:12:36.100
 It's like the Black Mirror, the first interactive

2:12:36.100 --> 2:12:37.460
 where they had all the, you know,

2:12:37.460 --> 2:12:41.440
 several million kind of permutations of the movie

2:12:41.440 --> 2:12:42.780
 that you could select on Netflix.

2:12:42.780 --> 2:12:44.700
 I've forgotten the name of it.

2:12:44.700 --> 2:12:47.660
 So this was exactly that in the laser disk.

2:12:47.660 --> 2:12:50.820
 So you basically go left, go right, fight the yoga,

2:12:50.820 --> 2:12:52.060
 slay the dragon.

2:12:52.060 --> 2:12:53.860
 And when you flick the joystick at the right time,

2:12:53.860 --> 2:12:55.860
 it just goes to the next animation to play.

2:12:55.860 --> 2:12:56.700
 Yeah.

2:12:56.700 --> 2:12:57.540
 It's not really generating it.

2:12:57.540 --> 2:12:58.380
 Yeah.

2:12:58.380 --> 2:13:00.500
 And I played that game and I knew I was being had.

2:13:01.460 --> 2:13:02.300
 So.

2:13:02.300 --> 2:13:03.120
 Oh, okay.

2:13:03.120 --> 2:13:03.960
 I see, I see.

2:13:03.960 --> 2:13:07.300
 So to you, Dragon Lair is the first time you realized

2:13:07.300 --> 2:13:09.380
 that free will is an illusion.

2:13:09.380 --> 2:13:10.220
 Yeah.

2:13:10.220 --> 2:13:14.980
 And why does assembly theory give you hints

2:13:14.980 --> 2:13:17.140
 about free will, whether it's an illusion or not?

2:13:17.140 --> 2:13:18.840
 Yeah, so no, so not tightly.

2:13:18.840 --> 2:13:22.700
 If I do think I have some will and I think I am an agent

2:13:22.700 --> 2:13:24.860
 and I think I can interact and I can play around

2:13:24.860 --> 2:13:27.100
 with the model I have of the world

2:13:27.100 --> 2:13:28.280
 and the cost functions, right?

2:13:28.280 --> 2:13:30.260
 And I can hack my own cost functions,

2:13:30.260 --> 2:13:32.340
 which means I have a little bit of free will.

2:13:32.340 --> 2:13:35.180
 But as much as I want to do stuff in the universe,

2:13:35.180 --> 2:13:37.340
 I don't think I could suddenly say,

2:13:37.340 --> 2:13:38.540
 I mean, actually this is ridiculous.

2:13:38.540 --> 2:13:39.900
 Cause now I say I could try and do it, right?

2:13:39.900 --> 2:13:41.180
 Like I'm suddenly give up everything

2:13:41.180 --> 2:13:44.140
 and become a rapper tomorrow, right?

2:13:44.140 --> 2:13:45.860
 Maybe I could try that,

2:13:45.860 --> 2:13:48.660
 but I don't have sufficient agency

2:13:48.660 --> 2:13:50.020
 to make that necessarily happen.

2:13:50.020 --> 2:13:51.440
 I'm on a trajectory.

2:13:51.440 --> 2:13:52.340
 So when in Dragon's Lair,

2:13:52.340 --> 2:13:56.500
 I know that I have some trajectories that I can play with

2:13:56.500 --> 2:13:58.900
 where Sartre realized he thought

2:13:58.900 --> 2:14:00.740
 that he had no assembly, no memory.

2:14:00.740 --> 2:14:03.380
 He could just leap across and do everything.

2:14:03.380 --> 2:14:06.820
 And Nietzsche said, okay, I realize I don't have

2:14:06.820 --> 2:14:09.300
 full freedom, but I have some freedom.

2:14:09.300 --> 2:14:11.300
 And the assembly theory basically says that,

2:14:11.300 --> 2:14:14.180
 it says, if you have these constraints in your past,

2:14:14.180 --> 2:14:16.420
 they limit what you were able to do in the future,

2:14:16.420 --> 2:14:19.300
 but you can use them to do amazing things.

2:14:19.300 --> 2:14:23.860
 Let's say I'm a poppy plant and I'm creating some opiates.

2:14:23.860 --> 2:14:25.780
 Opiates are really interesting molecules.

2:14:25.780 --> 2:14:27.900
 I mean, they're obviously great for medicine,

2:14:27.900 --> 2:14:29.740
 cause great problems in society.

2:14:29.740 --> 2:14:33.420
 But let's imagine we fast forward a billion years,

2:14:33.420 --> 2:14:37.780
 what will the opioids look like in a billion years?

2:14:37.780 --> 2:14:39.320
 Well, we can guess because we can see

2:14:39.320 --> 2:14:41.300
 how those proteins will evolve

2:14:41.300 --> 2:14:44.900
 and we can see how the secondary metabolites will change.

2:14:44.900 --> 2:14:46.460
 But they can't go radical.

2:14:46.460 --> 2:14:48.580
 They can't suddenly become, I don't know,

2:14:48.580 --> 2:14:52.260
 like a molecule that you find in an OLED in a display.

2:14:52.260 --> 2:14:53.300
 They will have some,

2:14:53.300 --> 2:14:56.940
 they will be limited by the causal chain that produced them.

2:14:56.940 --> 2:14:58.020
 And that's what I'm getting at,

2:14:58.020 --> 2:15:03.020
 saying we are unpredictably predictable

2:15:03.540 --> 2:15:07.520
 or predictably unpredictable within a constraint

2:15:07.520 --> 2:15:08.860
 on the trajectory we're on.

2:15:08.860 --> 2:15:10.120
 Yeah, so the predictably part

2:15:10.120 --> 2:15:12.460
 is the constraints of the trajectory

2:15:12.460 --> 2:15:14.820
 and the unpredictable part is the part

2:15:14.820 --> 2:15:16.620
 that you still haven't really clarified

2:15:16.620 --> 2:15:19.980
 the origin of the little bit of freedom.

2:15:19.980 --> 2:15:20.820
 Yeah.

2:15:20.820 --> 2:15:22.500
 So you're just arguing,

2:15:22.500 --> 2:15:26.720
 you're basically saying that radical freedom is impossible.

2:15:26.720 --> 2:15:29.080
 You're really operating in a world of constraints

2:15:29.080 --> 2:15:31.760
 that are constrained by the memory of the trajectory

2:15:31.760 --> 2:15:33.740
 of the chemistry that led to who you are.

2:15:33.740 --> 2:15:38.740
 Okay, but even just a tiny bit of freedom,

2:15:39.020 --> 2:15:44.020
 even if everything, if everywhere you are in cages,

2:15:45.940 --> 2:15:49.340
 if you can move around in that cage a little bit,

2:15:49.340 --> 2:15:50.580
 you're free.

2:15:50.580 --> 2:15:51.420
 I agree.

2:15:51.420 --> 2:15:55.740
 And so the question is in assembly theory,

2:15:55.740 --> 2:15:57.500
 if we're thinking about free will,

2:15:57.500 --> 2:15:59.720
 where does the little bit of freedom come from?

2:15:59.720 --> 2:16:03.700
 What is the eye that can decide to be a rapper?

2:16:03.700 --> 2:16:06.940
 What, why, what is that?

2:16:06.940 --> 2:16:10.440
 That's a cute little trick we've convinced each other of

2:16:10.440 --> 2:16:13.460
 so we can do fun tricks at parties

2:16:13.460 --> 2:16:15.320
 or is there something fundamental

2:16:15.320 --> 2:16:18.860
 that allows us to feel free, to be free?

2:16:18.860 --> 2:16:21.860
 I think that that's the question that I wanna answer.

2:16:21.860 --> 2:16:24.940
 I know you wanna answer it and I think it's so profound.

2:16:25.820 --> 2:16:27.140
 Let me have a go at it.

2:16:27.140 --> 2:16:30.260
 I would say that I don't take the stance of Sam Harris

2:16:30.260 --> 2:16:31.780
 because I think Sam Harris, when he said,

2:16:31.780 --> 2:16:33.180
 the way he says it is almost,

2:16:33.180 --> 2:16:34.020
 it's really interesting.

2:16:34.020 --> 2:16:35.020
 I'd love to talk to him about it.

2:16:35.020 --> 2:16:37.660
 Sam Harris almost thinks himself out of existence, right?

2:16:37.660 --> 2:16:40.620
 Because, do you know what I mean?

2:16:40.620 --> 2:16:43.540
 Yeah, well, I mean, he has different views

2:16:43.540 --> 2:16:45.340
 on consciousness versus free will.

2:16:45.340 --> 2:16:47.380
 I think he saves himself with consciousness.

2:16:47.380 --> 2:16:49.980
 He thinks himself out of existence with free will.

2:16:49.980 --> 2:16:50.900
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

2:16:50.900 --> 2:16:53.260
 So I mean, there's no point, right?

2:16:53.260 --> 2:16:54.080
 So I...

2:16:54.080 --> 2:16:55.820
 He's a leaf floating on a river.

2:16:55.820 --> 2:17:00.820
 Yeah, I think that he, I don't know,

2:17:00.820 --> 2:17:03.580
 I'd love to ask him whether he really believes that

2:17:03.580 --> 2:17:04.620
 and then we could play some games.

2:17:04.620 --> 2:17:05.460
 Oh, yeah.

2:17:05.460 --> 2:17:06.380
 No, no, I then would say,

2:17:06.380 --> 2:17:08.900
 I'll get him to play a game of cards with me

2:17:08.900 --> 2:17:11.580
 and I'll work out the conditions on which he says no,

2:17:11.580 --> 2:17:13.420
 and then I'll get him to the conditions he says yes,

2:17:13.420 --> 2:17:15.620
 and then I'll trap him in his logical inconsistency

2:17:15.620 --> 2:17:17.180
 with that argument.

2:17:17.180 --> 2:17:19.980
 Because at some point when he loses enough money

2:17:19.980 --> 2:17:21.880
 or the prospect of losing enough money,

2:17:23.220 --> 2:17:26.900
 there's a way of basically mapping out a series of...

2:17:26.900 --> 2:17:30.740
 So what will is about, let's not call it free will,

2:17:30.740 --> 2:17:34.540
 but what will is about is to have a series of decisions

2:17:34.540 --> 2:17:36.820
 equally weighted in front of you.

2:17:36.820 --> 2:17:39.620
 And those decisions aren't necessarily energy minimization.

2:17:39.620 --> 2:17:43.220
 Those decisions are a function of the model

2:17:43.220 --> 2:17:45.940
 you've made in your mind, you're in your simulation.

2:17:45.940 --> 2:17:48.740
 And the way you've interacted in reality

2:17:48.740 --> 2:17:52.100
 and also other interactions you're having

2:17:52.100 --> 2:17:55.260
 with other individuals and happenstance.

2:17:55.260 --> 2:18:00.260
 And I think that there's a little bit of delay in time.

2:18:00.260 --> 2:18:03.800
 So I think what you're able to do is say,

2:18:03.800 --> 2:18:06.640
 well, I'm gonna do the counterfactual.

2:18:06.640 --> 2:18:08.160
 I've done all of them.

2:18:08.160 --> 2:18:10.760
 And I'm gonna go this way.

2:18:10.760 --> 2:18:12.060
 And you probably don't know why.

2:18:12.060 --> 2:18:14.800
 I think free will is actually very complex interaction

2:18:14.800 --> 2:18:18.760
 between your unconscious and your conscious brain.

2:18:18.760 --> 2:18:20.760
 And I think the reason why we're arguing about it

2:18:20.760 --> 2:18:23.800
 is so interesting in that we just,

2:18:23.800 --> 2:18:26.960
 some people outsource their free will

2:18:26.960 --> 2:18:28.800
 to their unconscious brain.

2:18:28.800 --> 2:18:31.160
 And some people try and overthink

2:18:31.160 --> 2:18:33.080
 the free will and the conscious brain.

2:18:33.080 --> 2:18:35.440
 I would say that Sam Harris has realized

2:18:35.440 --> 2:18:36.880
 his conscious brain doesn't have free will,

2:18:36.880 --> 2:18:38.600
 but his unconscious brain does.

2:18:38.600 --> 2:18:39.640
 That's my guess, right?

2:18:39.640 --> 2:18:42.040
 And that he can't have access to the unconscious brain.

2:18:42.040 --> 2:18:43.640
 Yeah, and that's kind of annoying.

2:18:43.640 --> 2:18:46.380
 And so he's just, he's going to, through meditation,

2:18:46.380 --> 2:18:48.020
 come to acceptance with that fact.

2:18:48.020 --> 2:18:50.480
 Yeah, it's just maybe okay.

2:18:50.480 --> 2:18:55.000
 But I do think that I have the ability to make decisions

2:18:55.000 --> 2:18:56.000
 and I like my decisions.

2:18:56.000 --> 2:18:58.520
 In fact, I mean, this is an argument I have

2:18:58.520 --> 2:19:02.320
 with some people that some days I feel

2:19:02.320 --> 2:19:04.800
 I have no free will and it's just an illusion.

2:19:04.800 --> 2:19:06.640
 And this is one, and it makes me more radical,

2:19:06.640 --> 2:19:10.580
 if you like, you know, that I get to explore

2:19:10.580 --> 2:19:11.600
 more of the state space.

2:19:11.600 --> 2:19:13.640
 And I'm like, I'm going to try and affect the world now.

2:19:13.640 --> 2:19:15.240
 I'm really going to ask the question

2:19:15.240 --> 2:19:19.680
 that maybe I dare not ask or do the thing I dare not do.

2:19:19.680 --> 2:19:21.800
 And that allows me to kind of explore more.

2:19:21.800 --> 2:19:25.520
 It's funny that if you truly accept

2:19:25.520 --> 2:19:30.520
 that there's no free will, that is a kind of radical freedom.

2:19:31.680 --> 2:19:36.440
 It's funny, but you're, because the little bit

2:19:36.440 --> 2:19:40.000
 of the illusion under that framework that you have

2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:43.960
 that you can make choices, if choice is just an illusion

2:19:43.960 --> 2:19:46.800
 of psychology, you can do whatever the hell you want.

2:19:46.800 --> 2:19:47.640
 That's the.

2:19:47.640 --> 2:19:48.840
 But we don't, do we?

2:19:48.840 --> 2:19:49.680
 And I think.

2:19:49.680 --> 2:19:51.520
 But because you don't truly accept

2:19:51.520 --> 2:19:56.520
 that you think that there's like, you think there's a choice

2:19:56.840 --> 2:20:00.960
 which is why you don't just do whatever the hell you want.

2:20:00.960 --> 2:20:03.000
 Like you feel like there's some responsibility

2:20:03.000 --> 2:20:05.560
 for making the wrong choice, which is why you don't do it.

2:20:05.560 --> 2:20:07.480
 But if you truly accept that the choice

2:20:07.480 --> 2:20:12.040
 has already been made, then you can go,

2:20:12.040 --> 2:20:14.240
 I don't know what is the most radical thing.

2:20:16.000 --> 2:20:19.800
 I mean, but yeah, I don't, I wonder what,

2:20:19.800 --> 2:20:21.840
 what am I preventing myself from doing

2:20:21.840 --> 2:20:23.440
 that I would really want to do?

2:20:24.680 --> 2:20:26.120
 Probably like humor stuff.

2:20:26.120 --> 2:20:31.120
 Like I would love to, if I could like save a game,

2:20:31.720 --> 2:20:34.520
 do the thing and then reload it later,

2:20:34.520 --> 2:20:37.080
 like do undo, it probably would be humor.

2:20:37.080 --> 2:20:40.320
 Just to do something like super hilarious.

2:20:42.440 --> 2:20:43.840
 That's super embarrassing.

2:20:43.840 --> 2:20:46.640
 And then just go, I mean, it's basically just fun.

2:20:46.640 --> 2:20:47.960
 I would add more fun to the world.

2:20:47.960 --> 2:20:51.120
 I mean, I sometimes do that as I've, you know,

2:20:51.120 --> 2:20:56.120
 I sometimes I try and mess up my reality in unusual ways

2:20:56.360 --> 2:20:59.320
 by just doing things because I'm bored, but not bored.

2:20:59.320 --> 2:21:00.600
 I'm not expressing this very well.

2:21:00.600 --> 2:21:02.520
 I think that this is a really interesting problem

2:21:02.520 --> 2:21:05.560
 that perhaps the hard sciences don't really understand

2:21:05.560 --> 2:21:06.640
 that they are responsible for

2:21:06.640 --> 2:21:09.480
 because the question about how life emerged

2:21:09.480 --> 2:21:12.280
 and how intelligence emerges and consciousness and free will

2:21:12.280 --> 2:21:14.480
 they're all ultimately boiling down

2:21:14.480 --> 2:21:15.720
 to some of the same mechanics.

2:21:15.720 --> 2:21:19.280
 I think, my feeling is that they are the same problem

2:21:19.280 --> 2:21:20.920
 again and again and again.

2:21:20.920 --> 2:21:24.760
 The transition from a, you know, a boring world

2:21:24.760 --> 2:21:26.800
 or a world in which there is no selection.

2:21:26.800 --> 2:21:28.560
 So I wonder if free will has something to do

2:21:28.560 --> 2:21:29.840
 with selection and models.

2:21:29.840 --> 2:21:32.520
 And also the models you're generating in the brain

2:21:32.520 --> 2:21:34.160
 and also your, the amount of memory,

2:21:34.160 --> 2:21:35.960
 your working memory have available at any one time

2:21:35.960 --> 2:21:37.480
 to generate counterfactuals.

2:21:37.480 --> 2:21:38.320
 Well, that's fascinating.

2:21:38.320 --> 2:21:42.120
 So like the decision making process is a kind of selection

2:21:42.120 --> 2:21:43.760
 and that could be just another,

2:21:43.760 --> 2:21:48.200
 yet another manifestation of the selection mechanism

2:21:48.200 --> 2:21:50.320
 that's pervasive throughout the universe.

2:21:50.320 --> 2:21:52.640
 Okay, that's fascinating to think about.

2:21:54.760 --> 2:21:56.960
 Yeah, there's not some kind of fundamental,

2:21:56.960 --> 2:21:59.280
 it's own thing or something like that.

2:21:59.280 --> 2:22:01.960
 That is just yet another example of selection.

2:22:01.960 --> 2:22:06.280
 Yeah, and in the universe that's intrinsically open,

2:22:06.280 --> 2:22:08.640
 you want to do that because you generate novelty.

2:22:08.640 --> 2:22:10.680
 You mentioned something about,

2:22:10.680 --> 2:22:13.920
 do cellular automata exist outside the human mind

2:22:13.920 --> 2:22:16.040
 in our little offline conversation?

2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:18.760
 Why is that an interesting question?

2:22:18.760 --> 2:22:22.400
 So cellular automata, complexity,

2:22:22.400 --> 2:22:24.280
 what's the relationship between complexity

2:22:24.280 --> 2:22:28.880
 and the human mind and trees falling in the forest?

2:22:28.880 --> 2:22:30.520
 Infrastructure, so the CA,

2:22:30.520 --> 2:22:34.000
 so when John von Neumann and Conway and Feynman

2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:35.800
 were doing CA, it was doing on paper.

2:22:35.800 --> 2:22:37.200
 CA is cellular automata.

2:22:37.200 --> 2:22:38.880
 Just drawing them on paper.

2:22:38.880 --> 2:22:41.520
 How awesome is that, that they were doing cellular automata

2:22:41.520 --> 2:22:44.520
 on paper and then they were doing it on a computer

2:22:44.520 --> 2:22:48.760
 that takes like forever to print out anything and program.

2:22:48.760 --> 2:22:49.600
 Sure.

2:22:49.600 --> 2:22:51.000
 People are now with the TikTok,

2:22:51.000 --> 2:22:54.400
 kids these days with the TikTok don't understand

2:22:54.400 --> 2:22:57.080
 how amazing it is to just play with cellular automata,

2:22:57.080 --> 2:23:00.000
 arbitrarily changing the rules as you want,

2:23:00.000 --> 2:23:00.960
 the initial conditions,

2:23:00.960 --> 2:23:04.040
 and see the beautiful patterns emerge,

2:23:04.040 --> 2:23:06.200
 sing with fractals, all of that.

2:23:06.200 --> 2:23:07.560
 You've just given me a brilliant idea.

2:23:07.560 --> 2:23:09.520
 I wonder if there's a TikTok account that's just dedicated

2:23:09.520 --> 2:23:11.280
 to putting out CA rules and if there isn't,

2:23:11.280 --> 2:23:12.600
 we should make one.

2:23:12.600 --> 2:23:14.960
 100% and that will get.

2:23:14.960 --> 2:23:16.640
 So we have millions of views.

2:23:16.640 --> 2:23:17.720
 Millions, yes.

2:23:17.720 --> 2:23:20.240
 No, it'll get dozens.

2:23:20.240 --> 2:23:21.440
 We'll just have it running.

2:23:21.440 --> 2:23:25.440
 So look, I kind of, I love CAs.

2:23:29.280 --> 2:23:30.120
 Yeah, no.

2:23:30.120 --> 2:23:32.000
 We just have to make one.

2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:34.120
 I actually, a few years ago,

2:23:34.120 --> 2:23:36.120
 I made some robots that talk to each other,

2:23:36.120 --> 2:23:40.000
 chemical robots that played the game of Hex,

2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:42.920
 invented by John Nash, by doing chemistry.

2:23:42.920 --> 2:23:44.920
 And they communicated via Twitter,

2:23:44.920 --> 2:23:46.520
 which were experiments they were doing.

2:23:46.520 --> 2:23:49.760
 And they had a lookup table of experiments

2:23:49.760 --> 2:23:51.680
 and robot one said, I'm doing experiment 10.

2:23:51.680 --> 2:23:53.680
 And the other robot, okay, I'll do experiment one then.

2:23:53.680 --> 2:23:55.760
 And they communicated via Twitter.

2:23:55.760 --> 2:23:57.280
 Publicly or DMs?

2:23:57.280 --> 2:23:58.680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:23:58.680 --> 2:24:01.400
 Can you maybe quickly explain what the game of Hex is?

2:24:01.400 --> 2:24:04.280
 Yes, so it's basically a hexagonal board

2:24:04.280 --> 2:24:07.440
 and you try and basically you color each element

2:24:07.440 --> 2:24:08.840
 on the board of each hexagon

2:24:08.840 --> 2:24:10.640
 and you try and get from one side to the other

2:24:10.640 --> 2:24:12.440
 and the other one tries to block you.

2:24:12.440 --> 2:24:13.840
 How are they connected?

2:24:13.840 --> 2:24:14.680
 So what are the robots?

2:24:14.680 --> 2:24:16.720
 So it's a chemical.

2:24:16.720 --> 2:24:17.560
 Yeah, let's go back.

2:24:17.560 --> 2:24:18.880
 So there are two robots.

2:24:18.880 --> 2:24:20.640
 Each robot was doing dye chemistry.

2:24:20.640 --> 2:24:23.040
 So making RGB, red, green, blue, red, green, blue,

2:24:23.040 --> 2:24:24.160
 red, green, blue.

2:24:24.160 --> 2:24:26.200
 And they could just choose from experiments

2:24:26.200 --> 2:24:28.480
 to do red, green, blue.

2:24:28.480 --> 2:24:29.480
 Initially I said to my group,

2:24:29.480 --> 2:24:31.520
 we need to make two chemical robots that play chess.

2:24:31.520 --> 2:24:33.440
 And my group were like, that's too hard.

2:24:33.440 --> 2:24:35.320
 No, go away.

2:24:35.320 --> 2:24:36.760
 But anyway, so we had the robot.

2:24:36.760 --> 2:24:41.760
 By the way, people listening to this should probably know

2:24:42.080 --> 2:24:46.920
 that Lee Cronin is an amazing group of brilliant people.

2:24:46.920 --> 2:24:48.800
 He's exceptionally well published.

2:24:48.800 --> 2:24:52.200
 He's written a huge number of amazing papers.

2:24:52.200 --> 2:24:55.680
 Whenever he calls himself stupid

2:24:55.680 --> 2:24:57.920
 and is a sign of humility,

2:24:57.920 --> 2:25:00.240
 and I deeply respect that and appreciate it.

2:25:00.240 --> 2:25:01.960
 So people listening to this should know

2:25:01.960 --> 2:25:04.320
 this is a world class scientist

2:25:04.320 --> 2:25:05.640
 who doesn't take himself seriously,

2:25:05.640 --> 2:25:07.800
 which I really appreciate and love.

2:25:07.800 --> 2:25:11.720
 Anywho, talking about serious science,

2:25:11.720 --> 2:25:16.000
 we're back to your group rejecting your idea

2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:21.000
 of chemical robots playing chess via dyes.

2:25:22.760 --> 2:25:24.560
 So you went to a simpler game of Hex.

2:25:24.560 --> 2:25:26.320
 Okay, so what else?

2:25:26.320 --> 2:25:27.640
 The team that did it were brilliant.

2:25:27.640 --> 2:25:31.480
 I think they still have PTSD from doing it.

2:25:31.480 --> 2:25:32.600
 Cause I said, this is a workshop.

2:25:32.600 --> 2:25:36.760
 What I'd often do is I have about 60 people on my team.

2:25:36.760 --> 2:25:38.240
 And occasionally before lockdown,

2:25:38.240 --> 2:25:40.000
 I would say, I'm a bit bored.

2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:41.640
 We're gonna have a workshop on something.

2:25:41.640 --> 2:25:42.640
 Who wants to come?

2:25:42.640 --> 2:25:44.800
 And then basically about 20 people turn up to my office

2:25:44.800 --> 2:25:46.680
 and I say, we're gonna do this mad thing.

2:25:46.680 --> 2:25:49.360
 And then it would just self organize.

2:25:49.360 --> 2:25:51.120
 And some of them would be like, no, I'm not doing this.

2:25:51.120 --> 2:25:54.520
 And then you get left with the happy dozen.

2:25:54.520 --> 2:25:56.080
 And what we did is we built this robot

2:25:56.080 --> 2:25:57.800
 and doing dye chemistry is really easy.

2:25:57.800 --> 2:25:59.040
 You can just take two molecules,

2:25:59.040 --> 2:26:00.880
 react them together and change color.

2:26:00.880 --> 2:26:03.040
 And what I wanted to do is have a palette

2:26:03.040 --> 2:26:04.520
 of different molecules.

2:26:04.520 --> 2:26:07.000
 You can react combinatorially and get different colors.

2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:08.040
 So you've got two robots.

2:26:08.040 --> 2:26:09.440
 And I went, wouldn't it be cool

2:26:09.440 --> 2:26:12.040
 if the robots basically shared

2:26:12.040 --> 2:26:14.120
 the same list of reactions to do.

2:26:14.120 --> 2:26:15.680
 And they said, oh, and because of,

2:26:15.680 --> 2:26:18.720
 then you could do a kind of multi core chemistry.

2:26:18.720 --> 2:26:19.560
 Like they weren't,

2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:21.880
 so you'd have two chemical reactions going on at once

2:26:21.880 --> 2:26:23.720
 and they could basically outsource the problem.

2:26:23.720 --> 2:26:25.280
 But they're sharing the same tape.

2:26:25.280 --> 2:26:26.120
 Exactly.

2:26:26.120 --> 2:26:26.960
 Okay.

2:26:26.960 --> 2:26:27.800
 So robot one would say, I'm gonna do,

2:26:27.800 --> 2:26:28.920
 I'm gonna do experiment one.

2:26:28.920 --> 2:26:30.840
 And the other robot says, I'll do experiment 100.

2:26:30.840 --> 2:26:32.840
 And then they could cross it off.

2:26:32.840 --> 2:26:33.680
 But I wanted to make it.

2:26:33.680 --> 2:26:34.760
 That's brilliant, by the way.

2:26:34.760 --> 2:26:35.600
 I wanted to make.

2:26:35.600 --> 2:26:36.440
 That is genius.

2:26:36.440 --> 2:26:37.280
 Sorry.

2:26:37.280 --> 2:26:38.280
 Well, I wanted to make it groovier.

2:26:38.280 --> 2:26:41.960
 And I said, look, let's have them competing to make,

2:26:41.960 --> 2:26:43.680
 so they're playing a game of hex.

2:26:43.680 --> 2:26:46.400
 And so when the robot does an experiment

2:26:46.400 --> 2:26:48.440
 and the more blue the dye,

2:26:48.440 --> 2:26:51.160
 the more it gets the higher chance it gets

2:26:51.160 --> 2:26:53.440
 to make the move it wants on the hex board.

2:26:53.440 --> 2:26:55.320
 So if it gets a red color is like,

2:26:55.320 --> 2:26:57.520
 it gets down weighted in the other robot.

2:26:57.520 --> 2:26:59.400
 And so what the robots could do is they play,

2:26:59.400 --> 2:27:01.000
 each player move.

2:27:01.000 --> 2:27:03.880
 And cause the fitness function or the optimization function

2:27:03.880 --> 2:27:05.280
 was to make the color blue,

2:27:05.280 --> 2:27:09.240
 they started to invent reactions

2:27:09.240 --> 2:27:11.080
 we didn't, weren't on the list.

2:27:11.080 --> 2:27:13.120
 And they did this by not cleaning

2:27:13.120 --> 2:27:14.720
 because we made cleaning optional.

2:27:14.720 --> 2:27:17.400
 So when one robot realized if it didn't clean its pipes,

2:27:17.400 --> 2:27:18.800
 it could get blue more quickly.

2:27:18.800 --> 2:27:19.640
 Yeah.

2:27:19.640 --> 2:27:20.480
 And the other robot realized that.

2:27:20.480 --> 2:27:21.680
 So it was like getting dirty as well.

2:27:21.680 --> 2:27:22.520
 And they, they.

2:27:22.520 --> 2:27:26.320
 Unintended consequences of super intelligence.

2:27:26.320 --> 2:27:27.240
 Okay.

2:27:27.240 --> 2:27:28.080
 But.

2:27:28.080 --> 2:27:28.920
 That was the game.

2:27:28.920 --> 2:27:29.740
 And we.

2:27:29.740 --> 2:27:30.580
 Communicating through Twitter though.

2:27:30.580 --> 2:27:31.760
 They were, they were doing it through Twitter

2:27:31.760 --> 2:27:33.280
 and Twitter bland them a couple of times.

2:27:33.280 --> 2:27:34.760
 I said, come on, you've got a couple of robots

2:27:34.760 --> 2:27:35.600
 doing chemistry.

2:27:35.600 --> 2:27:36.420
 It's really cool.

2:27:36.420 --> 2:27:37.260
 Stop banning them.

2:27:37.260 --> 2:27:38.100
 Yeah.

2:27:38.100 --> 2:27:39.400
 But in the end they had, we had to take them off Twitter

2:27:39.400 --> 2:27:41.160
 and they just communicated via a server.

2:27:41.160 --> 2:27:43.080
 Cause it was just, there were people saying,

2:27:43.080 --> 2:27:43.920
 you can still find it.

2:27:43.920 --> 2:27:46.680
 Cronin lab one and Cronin lab two on Twitter.

2:27:46.680 --> 2:27:49.920
 And it was like, make move, wait, you know, mix A and B,

2:27:49.920 --> 2:27:51.360
 wait 10 seconds.

2:27:51.360 --> 2:27:52.200
 Yeah.

2:27:52.200 --> 2:27:53.360
 Answer blue, you know.

2:27:53.360 --> 2:27:56.060
 I really find it super compelling

2:27:56.060 --> 2:27:59.680
 that you would have a chemical entity

2:28:00.680 --> 2:28:03.120
 that's communicating with the world.

2:28:03.120 --> 2:28:04.200
 That was one of the things I want to do

2:28:04.200 --> 2:28:05.900
 with my origin of life reaction, right?

2:28:05.900 --> 2:28:10.160
 Is basically have a, have a reactor.

2:28:10.160 --> 2:28:12.000
 That's basically just randomly enumerating

2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:14.760
 for chemical space and have some kind of cycle

2:28:14.760 --> 2:28:17.220
 and then read out what the molecules reading out

2:28:17.220 --> 2:28:20.820
 using a mass spectrometer and then convert that to text

2:28:20.820 --> 2:28:23.560
 and publish it on Twitter and then wait until it says

2:28:23.560 --> 2:28:24.400
 I'm alive.

2:28:24.400 --> 2:28:27.120
 I reckon that would get, I reckon that,

2:28:27.120 --> 2:28:28.880
 that Twitter account would get a lot of followers.

2:28:28.880 --> 2:28:29.720
 Yeah.

2:28:29.720 --> 2:28:30.560
 And I'm still trying to convince my group

2:28:30.560 --> 2:28:32.720
 that we should just make an origin of life Twitter account.

2:28:32.720 --> 2:28:36.000
 Where it's going blue and it's like, hello, testing.

2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:37.360
 I'm here.

2:28:37.360 --> 2:28:38.300
 Well, I'll share it.

2:28:38.300 --> 2:28:39.140
 I like it.

2:28:39.140 --> 2:28:40.680
 I particularly enjoy this idea

2:28:42.960 --> 2:28:46.680
 of a non human entity communicating with the world

2:28:46.680 --> 2:28:48.880
 via human designed social network.

2:28:48.880 --> 2:28:55.240
 It's quite a, quite a beautiful idea.

2:28:55.240 --> 2:28:59.200
 How we were talking about CA's existing

2:28:59.200 --> 2:29:00.240
 outside the human mind.

2:29:00.240 --> 2:29:01.080
 Yeah.

2:29:01.080 --> 2:29:02.600
 So I really admire Stephen Wolfram.

2:29:02.600 --> 2:29:05.400
 I think he's a genius, clearly a genius

2:29:05.400 --> 2:29:06.400
 and trapped in is actually,

2:29:06.400 --> 2:29:08.280
 it's like a problem with being so smart

2:29:08.280 --> 2:29:11.560
 is you get trapped in your own mind, right?

2:29:11.560 --> 2:29:13.400
 And I've, I tried to actually,

2:29:13.400 --> 2:29:15.200
 I tried to convince Stephen that assembly theory

2:29:15.200 --> 2:29:16.040
 wasn't nonsense.

2:29:16.040 --> 2:29:17.840
 He was like, no, it's just nonsense.

2:29:17.840 --> 2:29:18.800
 I was a little bit sad by that.

2:29:18.800 --> 2:29:20.080
 So nonsense applied,

2:29:20.080 --> 2:29:22.760
 even if it applied to the simplest construct

2:29:22.760 --> 2:29:25.040
 of a one dimensional cellular automata, for example.

2:29:25.040 --> 2:29:25.880
 Yeah, yeah.

2:29:25.880 --> 2:29:26.700
 Well, I mean, actually,

2:29:26.700 --> 2:29:28.320
 maybe I'm doing myself a bit too down.

2:29:28.320 --> 2:29:30.960
 It was just as a theory was coming through

2:29:30.960 --> 2:29:33.200
 and I didn't really know how to explain it,

2:29:33.200 --> 2:29:35.040
 but we are going to use assembly theory

2:29:35.040 --> 2:29:36.640
 and CA's in cellular automata,

2:29:36.640 --> 2:29:38.640
 but I wanted to,

2:29:38.640 --> 2:29:42.640
 what I was really curious about is why people marvel.

2:29:42.640 --> 2:29:44.520
 I mean, you marvel CA's and their complexity.

2:29:44.520 --> 2:29:47.160
 And I said, well, hang on that complexity is baked in

2:29:47.160 --> 2:29:50.480
 because if you play the game of life in a CA,

2:29:50.480 --> 2:29:52.680
 you have to run it on a computer.

2:29:52.680 --> 2:29:53.900
 You have to have a,

2:29:53.900 --> 2:29:55.660
 you have to do a number of operations,

2:29:55.660 --> 2:29:57.200
 put in the boundary conditions.

2:29:57.200 --> 2:29:59.840
 So is it surprising that you get this structure out?

2:29:59.840 --> 2:30:02.880
 Is it manufactured by the boundary conditions?

2:30:02.880 --> 2:30:06.240
 And it is interesting because I think

2:30:06.240 --> 2:30:09.320
 a cellular automata running them

2:30:10.540 --> 2:30:11.840
 is teaching me something about

2:30:11.840 --> 2:30:14.040
 what real numbers are and aren't.

2:30:14.040 --> 2:30:15.140
 I haven't quite got there yet.

2:30:15.140 --> 2:30:16.800
 I was playing on the airplane coming over.

2:30:16.800 --> 2:30:17.640
 I'm just realized,

2:30:17.640 --> 2:30:20.080
 I have no idea what real numbers are really.

2:30:20.080 --> 2:30:20.920
 And I was like, well,

2:30:20.920 --> 2:30:24.200
 I do actually have some notion of what real numbers are.

2:30:24.200 --> 2:30:28.840
 And I think thinking about real numbers as functions

2:30:28.840 --> 2:30:30.880
 rather than numbers is more appropriate.

2:30:30.880 --> 2:30:33.600
 And then if you then apply that to CA's,

2:30:33.600 --> 2:30:36.160
 then you're saying, well, actually,

2:30:36.160 --> 2:30:39.960
 why am I seeing this complexity in this rule?

2:30:39.960 --> 2:30:42.640
 Is it, you know, is it,

2:30:42.640 --> 2:30:44.720
 you've got this deterministic system

2:30:44.720 --> 2:30:48.080
 and yet you get this incredible structure coming out.

2:30:48.080 --> 2:30:51.360
 Well, isn't that what you'd get with any real number

2:30:51.360 --> 2:30:54.320
 as you apply it as a function

2:30:54.320 --> 2:30:57.280
 and you're trying to read it out to an arbitrary position?

2:30:58.520 --> 2:31:00.280
 And I wonder if CA's are just helping me,

2:31:00.280 --> 2:31:02.360
 well, my misunderstanding of CA's

2:31:02.360 --> 2:31:03.600
 might be helping me understand them

2:31:03.600 --> 2:31:04.420
 in terms of real numbers.

2:31:04.420 --> 2:31:05.260
 I don't know what you think.

2:31:05.260 --> 2:31:07.440
 Yeah, well, the functions,

2:31:07.440 --> 2:31:10.800
 but the devil's in the function.

2:31:11.880 --> 2:31:13.440
 It's like, which is the function

2:31:13.440 --> 2:31:16.840
 that's generating your real number.

2:31:16.840 --> 2:31:20.800
 Like that, it seems like it's very important

2:31:20.800 --> 2:31:22.720
 the specific algorithm of that function

2:31:22.720 --> 2:31:25.160
 because some lead to something super trivial,

2:31:25.160 --> 2:31:27.280
 some lead to something that's all chaotic

2:31:27.280 --> 2:31:30.880
 and some lead to things that are just walked

2:31:30.880 --> 2:31:35.400
 that fine line of complexity and structure.

2:31:35.400 --> 2:31:36.240
 I think we agree.

2:31:36.240 --> 2:31:37.200
 So let's take it back a second.

2:31:37.200 --> 2:31:40.800
 So take the logistic map or something, logistic equation,

2:31:40.800 --> 2:31:42.400
 where you have this equation,

2:31:42.400 --> 2:31:46.560
 which is you don't know what's gonna happen at n plus one,

2:31:46.560 --> 2:31:48.920
 but once you've done n plus one, you know full time,

2:31:48.920 --> 2:31:50.400
 you can't predict it.

2:31:50.400 --> 2:31:53.640
 For me, CA's and logistic equation feel similar.

2:31:53.640 --> 2:31:57.400
 And I think what's incredibly interesting

2:31:57.400 --> 2:32:02.400
 and I share your kind of wonder at running a CA,

2:32:03.840 --> 2:32:05.080
 but also I'm saying, well,

2:32:05.080 --> 2:32:06.640
 what is it about the boundary conditions

2:32:06.640 --> 2:32:08.600
 and the way I'm running that calculation?

2:32:08.600 --> 2:32:10.200
 So in my group, with my team,

2:32:10.200 --> 2:32:12.080
 we actually made a chemical CA.

2:32:12.080 --> 2:32:13.080
 We made Game of Life.

2:32:13.080 --> 2:32:15.120
 We actually made a physical grid.

2:32:15.120 --> 2:32:16.440
 I haven't been able to publish this paper.

2:32:16.440 --> 2:32:18.880
 It's been trapped in purgatory for a long time,

2:32:18.880 --> 2:32:19.720
 but it might be about.

2:32:19.720 --> 2:32:20.560
 Yeah.

2:32:20.560 --> 2:32:21.400
 You wrote it up as a paper,

2:32:21.400 --> 2:32:23.080
 how to do a chemical formulation of the Game of Life,

2:32:23.080 --> 2:32:23.920
 which is played.

2:32:23.920 --> 2:32:25.800
 We made a chemical computer and little cells.

2:32:25.800 --> 2:32:26.960
 And I was playing Game of Life.

2:32:26.960 --> 2:32:28.280
 With the BZ reactions,

2:32:28.280 --> 2:32:31.280
 each cell would pulse on and off, on and off, on and off.

2:32:31.280 --> 2:32:34.280
 We have little stirrer bars and we have little gates.

2:32:34.280 --> 2:32:37.280
 And we actually played Conway's Game of Life in there.

2:32:37.280 --> 2:32:38.880
 And we got structures in that.

2:32:38.880 --> 2:32:41.920
 We got structures in that game from the chemistry

2:32:41.920 --> 2:32:44.320
 that you wouldn't expect from the actual CA.

2:32:44.320 --> 2:32:46.520
 So that was kind of cool in that.

2:32:46.520 --> 2:32:50.440
 Cause they're interacting outside of the cells more.

2:32:50.440 --> 2:32:52.200
 So what's happening is you're getting noise.

2:32:52.200 --> 2:32:55.400
 So the thing is that you've got this BZ reaction

2:32:55.400 --> 2:32:56.920
 that gives on off, on off, on off,

2:32:56.920 --> 2:32:58.800
 but there's also a wake

2:32:58.800 --> 2:33:00.960
 and those wakes constructively interfere

2:33:00.960 --> 2:33:05.960
 or in such a non trivial way that's non deterministic.

2:33:07.760 --> 2:33:11.040
 And the non determinism in the system

2:33:11.040 --> 2:33:12.720
 gives very rich dynamics.

2:33:12.720 --> 2:33:14.000
 And I was wondering if I could physically

2:33:14.000 --> 2:33:16.960
 make a chemical computer with this CA

2:33:18.120 --> 2:33:20.160
 that gives me something different.

2:33:20.160 --> 2:33:25.160
 I can't get in a silicon representation of a CA

2:33:25.400 --> 2:33:27.080
 where all the states are clean.

2:33:27.080 --> 2:33:29.440
 Cause you don't have the noise trailing

2:33:29.440 --> 2:33:30.680
 into the next round.

2:33:30.680 --> 2:33:32.080
 You just have the state.

2:33:32.080 --> 2:33:33.760
 So the paper in particular,

2:33:33.760 --> 2:33:37.040
 so that's just a beautiful idea to use a chemical computer

2:33:37.040 --> 2:33:39.280
 to construct the cellular automaton,

2:33:39.280 --> 2:33:41.280
 the famous one of game of life.

2:33:41.280 --> 2:33:42.320
 But it's also interesting.

2:33:42.320 --> 2:33:45.800
 And it's a really interesting scientific question

2:33:45.800 --> 2:33:48.360
 of whether some kind of random perturbations

2:33:48.360 --> 2:33:51.080
 or some source of randomness

2:33:51.080 --> 2:33:56.080
 can have a significant constructive effect

2:33:58.960 --> 2:34:00.320
 on the complexity of the system.

2:34:00.320 --> 2:34:03.120
 And indeed, I mean, whether it's random

2:34:03.120 --> 2:34:04.720
 or just non deterministic

2:34:04.720 --> 2:34:08.920
 and can we bake in that non determinism at the beginning?

2:34:08.920 --> 2:34:10.560
 I wonder what is the,

2:34:10.560 --> 2:34:12.480
 I'm trying to think of what is the encoding space.

2:34:12.480 --> 2:34:14.280
 The encoding space is pretty big.

2:34:14.280 --> 2:34:19.120
 We have 49 stirrups of 49 cells,

2:34:19.120 --> 2:34:22.000
 49 chem bits all connected to one another

2:34:22.000 --> 2:34:23.720
 and like an analog computer,

2:34:23.720 --> 2:34:27.000
 but being read out discreetly as the BZ reaction.

2:34:27.000 --> 2:34:30.280
 So just to say the BZ reaction is a chemical oscillator.

2:34:30.280 --> 2:34:31.440
 And what happened in each cell

2:34:31.440 --> 2:34:33.080
 is it goes between red and blue.

2:34:33.080 --> 2:34:34.960
 So two Russians discovered it,

2:34:34.960 --> 2:34:36.400
 Belouzov and Sapkinsky.

2:34:36.400 --> 2:34:38.440
 I think Belouzov first proposed it

2:34:38.440 --> 2:34:39.520
 and everyone said, you're crazy.

2:34:39.520 --> 2:34:40.720
 It breaks the second law.

2:34:40.720 --> 2:34:42.760
 And Sapkinsky said, no, it doesn't break the second law.

2:34:42.760 --> 2:34:44.080
 It's consuming a fuel.

2:34:45.240 --> 2:34:47.560
 And so, and then, and it's like,

2:34:47.560 --> 2:34:50.360
 there's a lot of chemistry hidden

2:34:50.360 --> 2:34:52.440
 in the Russian literature actually,

2:34:52.440 --> 2:34:54.760
 because Russians just wrote it in Russian.

2:34:54.760 --> 2:34:56.600
 They didn't publish it in English speaking journals.

2:34:56.600 --> 2:34:57.560
 It's heartbreaking actually.

2:34:57.560 --> 2:35:01.720
 Well, it's sad and it's great that it's there, right?

2:35:01.720 --> 2:35:02.560
 It's not lost.

2:35:02.560 --> 2:35:05.120
 I'm sure we will find a way of translating it properly.

2:35:05.120 --> 2:35:08.800
 Well, the silver lining slash greater sadness

2:35:08.800 --> 2:35:11.200
 of all of this is there's probably ideas

2:35:11.200 --> 2:35:12.880
 in English speaking.

2:35:12.880 --> 2:35:16.080
 Like there's ideas in certain disciplines

2:35:16.080 --> 2:35:20.120
 that if discovered by other disciplines

2:35:20.120 --> 2:35:22.400
 would crack open some of the biggest mysteries

2:35:22.400 --> 2:35:23.600
 in those disciplines.

2:35:23.600 --> 2:35:26.360
 Like computer science, for example,

2:35:26.360 --> 2:35:30.120
 is trying to solve problems

2:35:30.120 --> 2:35:32.840
 like nobody else has ever tried to solve problems.

2:35:32.840 --> 2:35:35.520
 As if it's not already been all addressed

2:35:35.520 --> 2:35:37.280
 in cognitive science and psychology,

2:35:37.280 --> 2:35:39.800
 in mathematics, in physics,

2:35:39.800 --> 2:35:42.840
 in just whatever you want to, economics even.

2:35:42.840 --> 2:35:44.680
 But if you look into that literature,

2:35:44.680 --> 2:35:47.600
 you might be able to discover some beautiful ideas.

2:35:47.600 --> 2:35:51.160
 Obviously Russian is an interesting case of that.

2:35:51.160 --> 2:35:53.480
 It's because there's a loss in translation,

2:35:53.480 --> 2:35:57.400
 but you said there's a source of fuel, a source of energy.

2:35:57.400 --> 2:35:58.240
 Yeah, yeah.

2:35:58.240 --> 2:36:00.960
 So the BZ reaction, you have an acid in there

2:36:00.960 --> 2:36:02.480
 called malonic acid.

2:36:02.480 --> 2:36:07.280
 And what happens is it's basically like a battery

2:36:07.280 --> 2:36:09.600
 that powers it and it loses CO2.

2:36:09.600 --> 2:36:12.000
 So decarboxylates, it's just a chemical reaction.

2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:14.440
 What that means we have to do is continuously feed

2:36:14.440 --> 2:36:16.520
 or we just keep the BZ reaction going

2:36:16.520 --> 2:36:18.120
 in a long enough time.

2:36:18.120 --> 2:36:21.080
 So it's like it's reversible in time.

2:36:22.640 --> 2:36:23.960
 But only like, yeah.

2:36:23.960 --> 2:36:26.360
 But only like, but it's fascinating.

2:36:26.360 --> 2:36:27.640
 I mean, the team that did it,

2:36:27.640 --> 2:36:29.640
 I'm really proud of their persistence.

2:36:29.640 --> 2:36:33.840
 We made a chemical computer and it can solve

2:36:33.840 --> 2:36:34.680
 little problems.

2:36:34.680 --> 2:36:36.320
 It can solve traveling salesman problems actually.

2:36:36.320 --> 2:36:37.760
 Nice.

2:36:37.760 --> 2:36:38.600
 But like I say, it's.

2:36:38.600 --> 2:36:41.000
 But not any faster than a regular computer.

2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:43.120
 Is there something you can do?

2:36:43.120 --> 2:36:45.040
 Maybe, I'm not sure.

2:36:46.160 --> 2:36:49.720
 I think we can come up with a way of solving problems,

2:36:49.720 --> 2:36:52.080
 also really complex, hard ones,

2:36:54.160 --> 2:36:56.200
 because it's an analog computer and we can,

2:36:56.200 --> 2:36:59.640
 it can energy minimize really quickly.

2:36:59.640 --> 2:37:01.360
 It doesn't have to basically go through every element

2:37:01.360 --> 2:37:05.440
 in the matrix, like flip it, it just reads out.

2:37:05.440 --> 2:37:07.920
 So we could actually do Monte Carlo

2:37:07.920 --> 2:37:10.640
 by just shaking the box.

2:37:10.640 --> 2:37:12.080
 It's literally a box shaker.

2:37:12.960 --> 2:37:14.920
 You don't actually have to encode the shaking of the box

2:37:14.920 --> 2:37:17.480
 in a silicon memory and then just shuffle everything around.

2:37:17.480 --> 2:37:18.320
 Yeah, and you can.

2:37:18.320 --> 2:37:19.680
 It's analog, it's natural.

2:37:19.680 --> 2:37:23.440
 So it's an organic computer.

2:37:23.440 --> 2:37:24.280
 Yeah, yeah.

2:37:24.280 --> 2:37:25.920
 So I was playing around with this

2:37:25.920 --> 2:37:27.480
 and I was kind of annoying some of my colleagues

2:37:27.480 --> 2:37:29.840
 and wondering if we could get to chemical supremacy

2:37:29.840 --> 2:37:31.480
 like quantum supremacy.

2:37:31.480 --> 2:37:36.000
 And I kind of calculated how big the grid has to be

2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:38.280
 so we can actually start to solve problems faster

2:37:38.280 --> 2:37:40.040
 than a silicon computer.

2:37:40.040 --> 2:37:43.320
 But I'm not willing to state how that is yet

2:37:43.320 --> 2:37:44.760
 because I'm probably wrong.

2:37:44.760 --> 2:37:46.960
 It's not that it's any top secret thing

2:37:46.960 --> 2:37:49.440
 is I want, I think I can make a chemical computer

2:37:49.440 --> 2:37:51.840
 that can solve optimization problems faster

2:37:51.840 --> 2:37:53.200
 than the silicon computer.

2:37:54.160 --> 2:37:55.560
 That's fascinating.

2:37:55.560 --> 2:37:57.840
 But then you're unsure how big that has to be.

2:37:57.840 --> 2:37:58.680
 Yeah, I think, I mean.

2:37:58.680 --> 2:38:00.760
 It might be a big box, hard to shake.

2:38:00.760 --> 2:38:03.000
 It might be exactly a big box, hard to shake

2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:05.120
 and basically a bit sloppy.

2:38:05.120 --> 2:38:08.160
 Did we answer the question about

2:38:08.160 --> 2:38:11.240
 do cellular atomic exists outside the mind?

2:38:11.240 --> 2:38:14.560
 We didn't, but I would posit that they don't.

2:38:14.560 --> 2:38:17.720
 And I, but I think minds can, well.

2:38:17.720 --> 2:38:19.600
 So the mind is fundamental.

2:38:19.600 --> 2:38:21.280
 What's the, why?

2:38:21.280 --> 2:38:23.200
 Well, I mean, sorry, let's go back.

2:38:23.200 --> 2:38:26.280
 So as a physical phenomena, do CAs exist

2:38:26.280 --> 2:38:28.520
 in physical reality, right?

2:38:28.520 --> 2:38:30.840
 I would say they probably don't exist

2:38:30.840 --> 2:38:33.000
 outside the human mind, but now we've constructed them.

2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:34.720
 They exist in computer memories.

2:38:34.720 --> 2:38:35.760
 They exist in my lab.

2:38:35.760 --> 2:38:37.000
 They exist on paper.

2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:40.720
 So they are, they emerge from the human mind.

2:38:40.720 --> 2:38:43.920
 I'm just interested in, because Stephen Wolfram likes CAs,

2:38:43.920 --> 2:38:46.360
 a lot of people like CAs and likes to think of them

2:38:46.360 --> 2:38:49.400
 as minimal computational elements.

2:38:49.400 --> 2:38:52.040
 I'm just saying, well, do they exist in reality

2:38:52.040 --> 2:38:54.320
 or are they a representation of a simple machine

2:38:54.320 --> 2:38:56.160
 that's just very elegant to implement?

2:38:57.560 --> 2:38:59.240
 So it's a platonic question, I guess.

2:38:59.240 --> 2:39:03.160
 I mean, it's, there's initial conditions.

2:39:03.160 --> 2:39:05.320
 There's a memory in the system.

2:39:05.320 --> 2:39:07.360
 There are simple rules that dictate

2:39:07.360 --> 2:39:09.080
 the evolution of the system.

2:39:09.080 --> 2:39:10.960
 So what exists?

2:39:10.960 --> 2:39:12.800
 The idea, the rules, the.

2:39:12.800 --> 2:39:15.360
 Yeah, people are using CAs as models

2:39:15.360 --> 2:39:18.640
 for things in reality to say, hey, look,

2:39:18.640 --> 2:39:21.640
 you can do this thing in a CA.

2:39:21.640 --> 2:39:24.520
 And my, when I see this, I'm saying, oh, that's cool.

2:39:24.520 --> 2:39:26.080
 But what does that tell me about reality?

2:39:26.080 --> 2:39:27.560
 Where's the CA in space?

2:39:27.560 --> 2:39:28.400
 Oh, I see.

2:39:28.400 --> 2:39:29.240
 Well, right.

2:39:29.240 --> 2:39:30.520
 It's a mathematical object.

2:39:30.520 --> 2:39:33.000
 So for people who don't know cellular automata,

2:39:33.000 --> 2:39:35.560
 there's usually a grid, whether it's one dimensional,

2:39:35.560 --> 2:39:36.960
 two dimensional, or three dimensional.

2:39:36.960 --> 2:39:39.400
 And it evolves by simple local rules,

2:39:39.400 --> 2:39:44.400
 like you die or are born if the neighbors are alive or dead.

2:39:44.400 --> 2:39:46.760
 And it turns out if you have,

2:39:46.760 --> 2:39:51.760
 with certain kinds of initial conditions

2:39:51.760 --> 2:39:53.440
 and with certain kinds of very simple rules,

2:39:53.440 --> 2:39:56.720
 you can create like arbitrarily complex

2:39:56.720 --> 2:39:57.680
 and beautiful systems.

2:39:57.680 --> 2:40:02.680
 And to me, whether drugs are involved or not,

2:40:03.760 --> 2:40:08.760
 I can sit back for hours and enjoy the mystery of it,

2:40:09.600 --> 2:40:14.600
 how such complexity can emerge as it gives me almost like,

2:40:14.600 --> 2:40:17.360
 you know, people talk about religious experiences.

2:40:17.360 --> 2:40:22.360
 It gives me a sense that you get to have a glimpse

2:40:23.480 --> 2:40:26.880
 at the origin of this whole thing.

2:40:26.880 --> 2:40:31.880
 Whatever is creating this complexity from such simplicity

2:40:33.800 --> 2:40:38.080
 is the very thing that brought my mind to life,

2:40:38.080 --> 2:40:42.960
 this me, the human, our human civilization.

2:40:42.960 --> 2:40:47.960
 And yes, those constructs are pretty trivial.

2:40:49.040 --> 2:40:50.760
 I mean, that's part of their magic

2:40:50.760 --> 2:40:54.320
 is even in this trivial framework,

2:40:54.320 --> 2:40:56.520
 you could see the emergence,

2:40:56.520 --> 2:40:58.840
 or especially in this trivial framework,

2:40:58.840 --> 2:41:01.840
 you could see the emergence of complexity from simplicity.

2:41:01.840 --> 2:41:05.920
 I guess what Lee, you're saying is that this is not,

2:41:05.920 --> 2:41:10.920
 you know, this is highly unlike systems

2:41:10.920 --> 2:41:13.040
 we see in the physical world,

2:41:13.040 --> 2:41:17.280
 even though they probably carry some of the same magic,

2:41:17.280 --> 2:41:19.240
 like mechanistically, that's all.

2:41:19.240 --> 2:41:22.360
 I mean, I'm saying that the operating system

2:41:22.360 --> 2:41:26.080
 that a CA has to exist on is quite complex.

2:41:26.080 --> 2:41:28.880
 And so I wonder if you're getting the complexity

2:41:28.880 --> 2:41:30.480
 out of the CA from the boundary conditions

2:41:30.480 --> 2:41:33.520
 of the operating system, the underlying digital computer.

2:41:33.520 --> 2:41:36.800
 Oh, wow, those are some strong words against CAs then.

2:41:36.800 --> 2:41:37.720
 I didn't realize. Not against.

2:41:37.720 --> 2:41:40.640
 I mean, I'm in love with CAs as well.

2:41:40.640 --> 2:41:44.520
 I'm just saying they aren't as trivial as people think.

2:41:44.520 --> 2:41:45.880
 They are incredible.

2:41:45.880 --> 2:41:47.200
 To get to that richness,

2:41:47.200 --> 2:41:51.000
 you have to iterate billions of times,

2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:54.960
 and you need a display, and you need a math coprocessor,

2:41:54.960 --> 2:41:57.720
 and you need a von Neumann machine

2:41:57.720 --> 2:41:59.040
 based on a Turing machine

2:41:59.040 --> 2:42:01.600
 of digital error correction and states.

2:42:01.600 --> 2:42:05.800
 Wow, to think that for the simplicity of a grid,

2:42:05.800 --> 2:42:08.840
 you're basically saying a grid is not simple.

2:42:08.840 --> 2:42:09.800
 Yeah.

2:42:09.800 --> 2:42:12.800
 It requires incredible complexity to bring a grid to life.

2:42:12.800 --> 2:42:13.640
 Yeah.

2:42:15.280 --> 2:42:16.120
 Yeah, that's it.

2:42:16.120 --> 2:42:17.400
 Well, then what is simple?

2:42:17.400 --> 2:42:18.440
 That's all I wanted to say.

2:42:18.440 --> 2:42:20.480
 I agree with you with the wonder of CAs, I just think.

2:42:20.480 --> 2:42:22.960
 But remember, we take so much for granted

2:42:22.960 --> 2:42:24.800
 what the CA is resting on.

2:42:24.800 --> 2:42:28.360
 Because von Neumann and Feynman weren't showing,

2:42:28.360 --> 2:42:30.000
 weren't seeing these elaborate structures.

2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:31.440
 They could not get that far.

2:42:33.240 --> 2:42:34.960
 Yeah, but that's the limitation of their mind.

2:42:34.960 --> 2:42:35.800
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

2:42:35.800 --> 2:42:37.440
 The limitation of their pencil.

2:42:37.440 --> 2:42:40.680
 But I think the question is

2:42:40.680 --> 2:42:44.200
 whether the essential elements of the cellular automata

2:42:47.280 --> 2:42:50.880
 is present without all the complexities

2:42:50.880 --> 2:42:52.440
 required to build a computer.

2:42:52.440 --> 2:42:56.080
 And my intuition, the reason I find it incredible

2:42:56.080 --> 2:42:58.320
 is that, yeah, my intuition is yes.

2:42:58.320 --> 2:43:00.840
 It might look different.

2:43:00.840 --> 2:43:05.120
 There might not be a grid like structure,

2:43:05.120 --> 2:43:09.720
 but local interactions operating under simple rules

2:43:09.720 --> 2:43:14.560
 and resulting in multi hierarchical complex structures

2:43:14.560 --> 2:43:17.920
 feels like a thing that doesn't require a computer.

2:43:17.920 --> 2:43:21.000
 I agree, but coming back to von Neumann and Feynman

2:43:21.000 --> 2:43:24.840
 and Wolfram, their minds, the non trivial minds

2:43:24.840 --> 2:43:26.560
 to create those architectures and do it

2:43:26.560 --> 2:43:30.720
 and to put on those state transitions.

2:43:30.720 --> 2:43:32.080
 And I think that's something

2:43:32.080 --> 2:43:34.520
 that's really incredibly interesting

2:43:34.520 --> 2:43:38.080
 that is understanding how the human mind

2:43:38.080 --> 2:43:40.720
 builds those state transition machines.

2:43:41.640 --> 2:43:43.360
 I could see how deeply in love

2:43:43.360 --> 2:43:45.040
 with the idea of memory you are.

2:43:45.040 --> 2:43:49.680
 So it's like how much of E equals MC squared

2:43:51.800 --> 2:43:53.840
 is more than an equation.

2:43:53.840 --> 2:43:56.480
 It has Albert Einstein in it.

2:43:57.680 --> 2:44:00.400
 You're saying you can't just say this is a,

2:44:00.400 --> 2:44:05.400
 like the equations of physics are a really good

2:44:06.360 --> 2:44:10.080
 simple capture of a physical phenomenon.

2:44:10.080 --> 2:44:15.000
 It is also, that equation has the memory of the humans.

2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:17.680
 Absolutely, absolutely, yeah.

2:44:18.680 --> 2:44:21.440
 But I don't, I don't know if you're implying this.

2:44:21.440 --> 2:44:25.080
 I don't, that's a beautiful idea,

2:44:25.080 --> 2:44:27.120
 but I don't know if I'm comfortable

2:44:27.120 --> 2:44:31.040
 with that sort of diminishing the power of that equation.

2:44:31.040 --> 2:44:31.880
 No, no, it enhances it.

2:44:31.880 --> 2:44:33.600
 Because it's built on the shoulders, it enhances it.

2:44:33.600 --> 2:44:35.200
 I think it enhances it, it's not,

2:44:35.200 --> 2:44:38.080
 that equation is a minimal compressed representation

2:44:38.080 --> 2:44:39.360
 of reality, right?

2:44:39.360 --> 2:44:43.440
 We can use machine learning or Max Tegmark's AI Feynman

2:44:43.440 --> 2:44:45.080
 to find lots of solutions for gravity,

2:44:45.080 --> 2:44:47.320
 but isn't it wonderful that the laws that we do find

2:44:47.320 --> 2:44:49.600
 are the maximally compressed representations?

2:44:50.920 --> 2:44:54.520
 Yeah, but that representation, you can now give it as,

2:44:54.520 --> 2:44:56.600
 I guess the universe has the memory of Einstein

2:44:56.600 --> 2:44:58.320
 with that representation.

2:44:58.320 --> 2:45:00.880
 But then you can now give it as a gift for free.

2:45:00.880 --> 2:45:01.720
 Yeah, yeah, it's low memory.

2:45:01.720 --> 2:45:02.960
 To other alien civilizations.

2:45:02.960 --> 2:45:03.800
 Einstein had to go through a lot of pain to get there,

2:45:03.800 --> 2:45:04.880
 but it's low memory.

2:45:04.880 --> 2:45:07.280
 So, I say that physics and chemistry and biology

2:45:07.280 --> 2:45:08.720
 are the same discipline.

2:45:08.720 --> 2:45:11.760
 They're just physics, laws in physics.

2:45:11.760 --> 2:45:13.320
 There's no such thing as a law in physics.

2:45:13.320 --> 2:45:15.560
 It's just low memory stuff.

2:45:15.560 --> 2:45:16.920
 Because you've got low memory stuff,

2:45:16.920 --> 2:45:19.800
 you can, things reoccur quickly.

2:45:19.800 --> 2:45:21.280
 As you can get, build in more memory,

2:45:21.280 --> 2:45:24.000
 you get to chemistry, so things become more contingent.

2:45:24.000 --> 2:45:26.160
 When you get to biology, more contingent still,

2:45:26.160 --> 2:45:27.400
 and then technology.

2:45:27.400 --> 2:45:28.800
 So, the more memory you need,

2:45:28.800 --> 2:45:31.480
 the more your laws are local.

2:45:31.480 --> 2:45:32.640
 That's all I'm saying.

2:45:32.640 --> 2:45:35.480
 And the less memory, the more the laws are universal,

2:45:35.480 --> 2:45:36.320
 because they're not laws.

2:45:36.320 --> 2:45:37.920
 They are just low memory states.

2:45:40.040 --> 2:45:44.040
 We have to talk about a thing you've kind of mentioned

2:45:44.040 --> 2:45:45.360
 already a bunch of times,

2:45:45.360 --> 2:45:49.640
 but doing computation through chemistry,

2:45:49.640 --> 2:45:51.840
 chemical based computation.

2:45:51.840 --> 2:45:56.840
 I've seen you refer to it as in a sexy title

2:45:56.840 --> 2:46:00.920
 of Kemputation, Kemputation.

2:46:00.920 --> 2:46:02.640
 So, what is computation?

2:46:02.640 --> 2:46:06.200
 What is chemical based computation?

2:46:06.200 --> 2:46:09.680
 Okay, so Kemputation is a name I gave

2:46:09.680 --> 2:46:12.960
 to the process of building a state machine

2:46:12.960 --> 2:46:15.880
 to make any molecule physically in the lab.

2:46:15.880 --> 2:46:19.440
 And so, as a chemist, chemists make molecules by hand.

2:46:19.440 --> 2:46:22.880
 And they're quite hard.

2:46:22.880 --> 2:46:25.280
 The chemists have a lot of tacit knowledge,

2:46:25.280 --> 2:46:26.840
 a lot of ambiguity.

2:46:26.840 --> 2:46:29.720
 It's not possible to go uniformly to the literature

2:46:29.720 --> 2:46:32.440
 and read a recipe to make a molecule,

2:46:32.440 --> 2:46:35.400
 and then go and make it in the lab every time.

2:46:35.400 --> 2:46:37.440
 Some recipes are better than others,

2:46:37.440 --> 2:46:42.440
 but they all assume some knowledge.

2:46:43.080 --> 2:46:44.880
 And it's not universal what that is.

2:46:44.880 --> 2:46:49.640
 Like, so it's carried from human to human.

2:46:49.640 --> 2:46:51.120
 Some of that implicit knowledge.

2:46:51.120 --> 2:46:52.600
 And you're saying, can we remove the human

2:46:52.600 --> 2:46:53.440
 from the patient?

2:46:53.440 --> 2:46:55.160
 Can we like a program?

2:46:55.160 --> 2:46:57.520
 Okay, well, by the way, what is a state machine?

2:46:58.640 --> 2:47:01.840
 So a state machine is a, I suppose,

2:47:01.840 --> 2:47:05.760
 a object either abstract or mechanical

2:47:05.760 --> 2:47:10.560
 where you can do a unit operation on it

2:47:10.560 --> 2:47:12.280
 and flick it from one state to another.

2:47:12.280 --> 2:47:15.960
 So a turnstile would be a good example of a state machine.

2:47:15.960 --> 2:47:17.400
 There's some kinds of states

2:47:17.400 --> 2:47:19.680
 and some kind of transitions between states.

2:47:19.680 --> 2:47:23.640
 And it's very formal in nature

2:47:23.640 --> 2:47:25.040
 in terms of like it's precise,

2:47:25.040 --> 2:47:25.880
 how you're doing those transitions.

2:47:25.880 --> 2:47:28.120
 Yes, you can mathematically precisely

2:47:28.120 --> 2:47:29.440
 describe a state machine.

2:47:29.440 --> 2:47:33.160
 So, I mean, a very simple Boolean gates

2:47:33.160 --> 2:47:35.440
 are a very good way of building

2:47:35.440 --> 2:47:37.480
 kind of logic based state machines.

2:47:38.360 --> 2:47:39.920
 Obviously a Turing machine,

2:47:39.920 --> 2:47:41.440
 the concept of a Turing machine

2:47:41.440 --> 2:47:43.520
 where you have a tape and a read head

2:47:43.520 --> 2:47:46.200
 and a series of rules in a table

2:47:46.200 --> 2:47:49.400
 and you would basically look at what's on the tape.

2:47:49.400 --> 2:47:51.600
 And if you're shifting the tape from left to right,

2:47:51.600 --> 2:47:53.480
 and if you see a zero or one,

2:47:53.480 --> 2:47:54.960
 you look in your lookup table and say,

2:47:54.960 --> 2:47:57.440
 right, I've seen a zero and a one.

2:47:57.440 --> 2:48:01.680
 I then do, I then respond to that.

2:48:01.680 --> 2:48:03.720
 So in the turnstile would be,

2:48:03.720 --> 2:48:06.680
 is there a human being pushing the turnstile

2:48:06.680 --> 2:48:09.280
 in direction clockwise?

2:48:09.280 --> 2:48:11.360
 If yes, I will open, let them go.

2:48:11.360 --> 2:48:12.960
 If it's anticlockwise, no.

2:48:12.960 --> 2:48:15.120
 So yeah, so a state machine has some labels

2:48:15.120 --> 2:48:17.920
 and a transition diagram.

2:48:17.920 --> 2:48:22.120
 So you're looking to come up with a chemical computer

2:48:22.120 --> 2:48:25.560
 to form state machines to create molecules,

2:48:25.560 --> 2:48:29.320
 or what's the chicken and the egg?

2:48:29.320 --> 2:48:31.480
 So computation is not a chemical computer

2:48:31.480 --> 2:48:32.360
 because we talked a few moments

2:48:32.360 --> 2:48:35.280
 about actually doing computations with chemicals.

2:48:35.280 --> 2:48:37.520
 What I'm now saying is I want to use state machines

2:48:37.520 --> 2:48:39.680
 to transform chemicals.

2:48:39.680 --> 2:48:42.680
 And so build chemicals programmatically.

2:48:42.680 --> 2:48:44.480
 Yeah, I mean, I get in trouble saying this.

2:48:44.480 --> 2:48:47.000
 I said to my group, oh, I shouldn't say it

2:48:47.000 --> 2:48:49.600
 because it's, but I said, look, we should make the crack bot.

2:48:49.600 --> 2:48:51.200
 Is it in the crack robot?

2:48:51.200 --> 2:48:52.040
 The robot that makes crack.

2:48:52.040 --> 2:48:52.880
 The crack bot?

2:48:52.880 --> 2:48:55.240
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, crack bot.

2:48:55.240 --> 2:48:56.440
 The robot that makes crack,

2:48:56.440 --> 2:48:59.040
 but maybe we should scrub this from, but.

2:49:00.600 --> 2:49:03.120
 Or, well, so maybe you can educate me

2:49:03.120 --> 2:49:06.160
 on breaking bad with like math, right?

2:49:06.160 --> 2:49:07.600
 Yeah, so in breaking bad.

2:49:07.600 --> 2:49:12.080
 You want to make basically some kind of mix

2:49:12.080 --> 2:49:15.400
 of ex machina and breaking bad.

2:49:15.400 --> 2:49:16.240
 No, I don't.

2:49:16.240 --> 2:49:17.080
 I don't.

2:49:17.080 --> 2:49:17.920
 For the record, I don't, but I said.

2:49:17.920 --> 2:49:18.760
 No, you don't.

2:49:18.760 --> 2:49:19.880
 I said, that's what I'm going to do

2:49:19.880 --> 2:49:21.520
 once you release the papers.

2:49:23.880 --> 2:49:28.880
 I shaved my head and I'm going to live a life of crime.

2:49:28.920 --> 2:49:29.760
 Anyway, I'm sorry.

2:49:29.760 --> 2:49:30.600
 No, no.

2:49:30.600 --> 2:49:33.280
 So yeah, let's get back to, so indeed,

2:49:33.280 --> 2:49:35.320
 it is about making drugs, but importantly,

2:49:35.320 --> 2:49:38.320
 making important drugs, so let's.

2:49:38.320 --> 2:49:39.840
 All drugs matter.

2:49:39.840 --> 2:49:41.480
 Yeah, but let's go back.

2:49:41.480 --> 2:49:46.040
 So the basic thesis is chemistry is very analog.

2:49:46.040 --> 2:49:47.400
 There is no state machine.

2:49:48.880 --> 2:49:52.800
 And I wandered into the, through the paper walls

2:49:52.800 --> 2:49:55.000
 in the Japanese house a few years ago and said,

2:49:55.000 --> 2:49:58.120
 okay, hey, organic chemist, why are you doing this analog?

2:49:58.120 --> 2:50:00.400
 They said, well, chemistry is really hard.

2:50:00.400 --> 2:50:03.320
 You can't automate it, it's impossible.

2:50:03.320 --> 2:50:05.360
 I said, but is it impossible?

2:50:05.360 --> 2:50:06.200
 They said, yeah.

2:50:06.200 --> 2:50:07.680
 And they said, you know, I got the impression

2:50:07.680 --> 2:50:09.560
 they were saying it's magic.

2:50:09.560 --> 2:50:11.720
 And so when people tell me things are magic,

2:50:12.800 --> 2:50:14.120
 it's like, no, no, they can't be magic.

2:50:14.120 --> 2:50:15.680
 Right, so let's break this down.

2:50:15.680 --> 2:50:19.560
 And so what I did is I went to my group one day

2:50:19.560 --> 2:50:21.680
 about eight years ago and said, hey guys,

2:50:21.680 --> 2:50:24.400
 I've written this new programming language for you.

2:50:24.400 --> 2:50:26.680
 And so everything is clear.

2:50:26.680 --> 2:50:28.480
 And you know, you have to, you're not allowed to

2:50:28.480 --> 2:50:30.080
 just wander around the lab willy nilly.

2:50:30.080 --> 2:50:31.480
 You have to pick up things in order,

2:50:31.480 --> 2:50:34.280
 go to the balance of the right time and all this stuff.

2:50:34.280 --> 2:50:36.000
 And they looked at me as if I was insane

2:50:36.000 --> 2:50:37.480
 and basically kicked me out of the lab and said,

2:50:37.480 --> 2:50:39.560
 no, don't do that, we're not doing that.

2:50:39.560 --> 2:50:40.400
 And I said, okay.

2:50:40.400 --> 2:50:42.120
 So I went back the next day and said,

2:50:43.160 --> 2:50:45.760
 I'm gonna find some money so we can make cool robots

2:50:45.760 --> 2:50:46.800
 do chemical reactions.

2:50:46.800 --> 2:50:48.920
 And everyone went, that's cool.

2:50:48.920 --> 2:50:50.720
 And so in that process.

2:50:51.600 --> 2:50:54.160
 The first we tried to convert the humans to become robots

2:50:54.160 --> 2:50:57.320
 and next you agree you might as well just create the robots.

2:50:57.320 --> 2:51:00.160
 Yes, but so in that, the formalization process.

2:51:00.160 --> 2:51:02.640
 Yeah, so what I did is I said, look, chemical,

2:51:02.640 --> 2:51:04.960
 to make a molecule, you need to do four things abstractly.

2:51:04.960 --> 2:51:07.040
 I want to make a chemical Turing machine.

2:51:07.040 --> 2:51:08.800
 Cause a Turing machine, you think about this,

2:51:08.800 --> 2:51:10.080
 imagine a Turing machine.

2:51:10.080 --> 2:51:14.600
 Turing machine is the ultimate abstraction of a computation

2:51:14.600 --> 2:51:17.960
 because it's been shown by Turing and others

2:51:17.960 --> 2:51:19.960
 that basically a universal Turing machine

2:51:19.960 --> 2:51:23.080
 should be able to do all computations that you can imagine.

2:51:23.080 --> 2:51:25.680
 It's like, wow, why don't I think of a Turing machine

2:51:25.680 --> 2:51:26.520
 for chemistry?

2:51:26.520 --> 2:51:29.760
 Let's think of a magic robot that can make any molecule.

2:51:29.760 --> 2:51:31.560
 Let's think about that for a second.

2:51:31.560 --> 2:51:32.480
 Okay, great.

2:51:32.480 --> 2:51:33.560
 How do we then implement it?

2:51:33.560 --> 2:51:34.400
 And I think it's right.

2:51:34.400 --> 2:51:35.760
 So what is the abstraction?

2:51:35.760 --> 2:51:39.280
 So to make any molecule, you have to do a reaction.

2:51:39.280 --> 2:51:41.480
 So you have to put reagents together, do a reaction

2:51:41.480 --> 2:51:43.880
 in a flask typically.

2:51:43.880 --> 2:51:44.960
 Then you're after the reaction,

2:51:44.960 --> 2:51:45.960
 you have to stop the reactions.

2:51:45.960 --> 2:51:47.400
 You do what's called a workup.

2:51:47.400 --> 2:51:51.600
 So whatever, cool it down, add some liquid to it, extract.

2:51:51.600 --> 2:51:53.560
 So then after you do the workup, you separate.

2:51:53.560 --> 2:51:55.920
 So you then remove the molecules, separate them all out.

2:51:55.920 --> 2:51:58.160
 And then the final step is purification.

2:51:58.160 --> 2:52:01.720
 So reaction, workup, separate, purify.

2:52:01.720 --> 2:52:05.880
 So this is basically exactly like a Turing machine

2:52:05.880 --> 2:52:08.280
 where you have your tape, you have your tape head,

2:52:08.280 --> 2:52:10.360
 you have some rules, and then you run it.

2:52:10.360 --> 2:52:11.760
 So I thought, cool.

2:52:11.760 --> 2:52:13.240
 I went to all the chemists and said, look,

2:52:13.240 --> 2:52:15.320
 chemistry isn't that hard.

2:52:15.320 --> 2:52:18.360
 Reaction, workup, separation, purification.

2:52:18.360 --> 2:52:20.960
 Do that in cycles, forever, for any molecule,

2:52:20.960 --> 2:52:23.160
 all the chemistry, done.

2:52:23.160 --> 2:52:26.200
 And they said, chemistry is that hard.

2:52:26.200 --> 2:52:28.240
 I said, but just in principle.

2:52:28.240 --> 2:52:30.520
 And I got a few very enlightened people to say,

2:52:30.520 --> 2:52:33.160
 yeah, okay, in principle, but it ain't gonna work.

2:52:33.160 --> 2:52:36.600
 And this was in about 2013, 2014.

2:52:36.600 --> 2:52:39.840
 And I found myself going to an architecture conference

2:52:39.840 --> 2:52:40.840
 almost by accident.

2:52:40.840 --> 2:52:42.720
 It's like, why am I at this random conference

2:52:42.720 --> 2:52:44.400
 on architecture?

2:52:44.400 --> 2:52:45.920
 And that was because I published a paper

2:52:45.920 --> 2:52:47.840
 on inorganic architecture.

2:52:47.840 --> 2:52:49.440
 And they said, come to architecture conference.

2:52:49.440 --> 2:52:51.720
 But the inorganic architecture is nano architecture.

2:52:51.720 --> 2:52:53.160
 It's not, and I went, okay.

2:52:53.160 --> 2:52:54.880
 And then I found these guys at the conference,

2:52:54.880 --> 2:52:57.400
 3D printing ping pong balls and shapes.

2:52:57.400 --> 2:52:58.240
 And this is through it.

2:52:58.240 --> 2:52:59.080
 3D printing was cool.

2:52:59.080 --> 2:53:00.440
 And I was like, this is ridiculous.

2:53:00.440 --> 2:53:01.880
 Why are you 3D printing ping pong balls?

2:53:01.880 --> 2:53:03.400
 And I gave them a whole load of abuse

2:53:03.400 --> 2:53:05.320
 like I normally do when I first meet people,

2:53:05.320 --> 2:53:07.240
 how to win friends and influence people.

2:53:07.240 --> 2:53:10.240
 And then I was like, oh my God, you guys are geniuses.

2:53:10.240 --> 2:53:12.000
 And so I got from, they were a bit confused

2:53:12.000 --> 2:53:13.080
 because I was calling them idiots

2:53:13.080 --> 2:53:14.120
 and then call them geniuses.

2:53:14.120 --> 2:53:16.120
 It's like, will you come to my lab

2:53:16.120 --> 2:53:18.240
 and we're gonna build a robot to do chemistry

2:53:18.240 --> 2:53:19.080
 with a 3D printer.

2:53:19.080 --> 2:53:20.960
 And I said, oh, that's cool, all right.

2:53:20.960 --> 2:53:22.320
 So I had them come to the lab

2:53:22.320 --> 2:53:24.000
 and we started to 3D print test tubes.

2:53:24.000 --> 2:53:26.760
 So you imagine, you know, 3D print a bottle

2:53:26.760 --> 2:53:30.560
 and then use the same gantry to basically,

2:53:30.560 --> 2:53:34.160
 rather than to squirt out a plastic out of a nozzle,

2:53:34.160 --> 2:53:36.400
 have a little syringe and jet chemicals in.

2:53:36.400 --> 2:53:38.720
 So we had the 3D printer that could simultaneously

2:53:38.720 --> 2:53:40.560
 print the test tube and then put chemicals

2:53:40.560 --> 2:53:42.080
 into the test tube.

2:53:42.080 --> 2:53:42.920
 And then.

2:53:42.920 --> 2:53:44.480
 Wow, so it's really end to end.

2:53:44.480 --> 2:53:45.600
 Yeah, I was like, that would be cool

2:53:45.600 --> 2:53:47.080
 because they've got G code to do it all.

2:53:47.080 --> 2:53:48.760
 And I was like, that's cool.

2:53:48.760 --> 2:53:50.800
 So I got my group doing this and I developed it a bit

2:53:50.800 --> 2:53:54.600
 and I realized that we could take those unit operations.

2:53:54.600 --> 2:53:57.160
 And we built a whole bunch of pumps and valves.

2:53:57.160 --> 2:54:00.840
 And I realized that I could basically take the literature

2:54:00.840 --> 2:54:05.840
 and I made the first version of the computer in 2016, 17.

2:54:05.920 --> 2:54:07.520
 I made some architectural decisions.

2:54:07.520 --> 2:54:09.400
 So I designed the pumps and valves in my group.

2:54:09.400 --> 2:54:10.760
 I did all the electronics in my group.

2:54:10.760 --> 2:54:12.320
 They were brilliant.

2:54:12.320 --> 2:54:15.880
 I cannot pay tribute to my group enough in doing this.

2:54:15.880 --> 2:54:16.720
 They were just brilliant.

2:54:16.720 --> 2:54:18.400
 And there were some poor souls there that said,

2:54:18.400 --> 2:54:21.320
 Lee, why are you making us design electronics?

2:54:21.320 --> 2:54:24.280
 I'm like, well, because I don't understand it.

2:54:24.280 --> 2:54:26.040
 They're like, so you're making us design stuff

2:54:26.040 --> 2:54:26.880
 because you don't understand.

2:54:26.880 --> 2:54:29.680
 It's like, yeah, it's like, but can we not just buy some?

2:54:29.680 --> 2:54:31.560
 I said, well, we can, but then I don't understand

2:54:31.560 --> 2:54:34.520
 how to, you know, what bus they're gonna use

2:54:34.520 --> 2:54:36.040
 and there's serial ports and all this stuff.

2:54:36.040 --> 2:54:39.040
 I just wanted, and I made, I came up with a decision

2:54:39.040 --> 2:54:41.120
 to design a bunch of pumps and valves

2:54:41.120 --> 2:54:42.600
 and use power of the ethernet.

2:54:42.600 --> 2:54:45.360
 So they've got one cable for power and data,

2:54:45.360 --> 2:54:48.080
 plug them all in, plug them all into a router

2:54:48.080 --> 2:54:51.360
 and then I made the state machine.

2:54:51.360 --> 2:54:53.680
 And there was a couple of cool things I did.

2:54:53.680 --> 2:54:54.880
 Oh, they did actually.

2:54:55.760 --> 2:54:57.160
 We got the abstraction.

2:54:57.160 --> 2:55:01.580
 So reaction, workup, separation, purification.

2:55:02.600 --> 2:55:06.080
 And then I made the decision to do it in batch.

2:55:06.080 --> 2:55:07.880
 Now it's in batch.

2:55:07.880 --> 2:55:10.640
 All chemistry had been digitized before apparently,

2:55:10.640 --> 2:55:13.960
 and once it's been done, but everyone been doing it in flow

2:55:13.960 --> 2:55:16.240
 and flow is continuous and there are infinities everywhere

2:55:16.240 --> 2:55:19.040
 and you have to just, and I realized

2:55:19.040 --> 2:55:20.640
 that I could actually make a state machine

2:55:20.640 --> 2:55:23.860
 where I basically put stuff in the reactor,

2:55:24.860 --> 2:55:26.900
 turn it up from one state to another state,

2:55:26.900 --> 2:55:28.380
 stop it and just read it out.

2:55:28.380 --> 2:55:30.680
 And okay, and I was kind of bitching

2:55:30.680 --> 2:55:32.360
 at electrical engineers saying, you have it easy.

2:55:32.360 --> 2:55:34.760
 You don't have to clean out the electrons, you know.

2:55:34.760 --> 2:55:36.380
 Electrons don't leave a big mess.

2:55:36.380 --> 2:55:37.900
 They leave some EM waste.

2:55:37.900 --> 2:55:39.760
 But in my state machine I built in cleaning.

2:55:39.760 --> 2:55:41.600
 So it's like, we do all the operation

2:55:41.600 --> 2:55:43.320
 and then it cleans the backbone and then can do it again.

2:55:43.320 --> 2:55:46.020
 So there's no, so what we managed to do

2:55:46.020 --> 2:55:49.280
 over a couple of years is develop the hardware,

2:55:49.280 --> 2:55:50.720
 develop the state machine.

2:55:50.720 --> 2:55:52.140
 And we encoded three molecules.

2:55:52.140 --> 2:55:54.120
 We did three, the first three, we did nitole,

2:55:54.120 --> 2:55:57.160
 a sleeping drug, rafinamide, antiseizure and Viagra.

2:55:57.160 --> 2:55:59.560
 You know, and I could make jokes on the paper.

2:55:59.560 --> 2:56:02.120
 It's a hard problem, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2:56:02.120 --> 2:56:04.320
 That's very good.

2:56:04.320 --> 2:56:06.440
 And then in the next one, what we did is said, okay,

2:56:06.440 --> 2:56:09.520
 my poor organic chemist said, look, Lee,

2:56:09.520 --> 2:56:11.220
 we've worked with you this long.

2:56:11.220 --> 2:56:12.880
 We've made a robot that looks like

2:56:12.880 --> 2:56:14.660
 it's gonna take our jobs away.

2:56:14.660 --> 2:56:19.040
 And not just take our jobs away, what we love in the lab,

2:56:19.040 --> 2:56:20.800
 but now we have to become programmers.

2:56:20.800 --> 2:56:22.000
 But we're not even good programmers.

2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:25.060
 We just have to spend ages writing lines of code

2:56:25.060 --> 2:56:27.440
 that are boring and it's not as elegant.

2:56:27.440 --> 2:56:28.840
 I went, you're right.

2:56:28.840 --> 2:56:32.720
 So then, but I knew because I had this abstraction

2:56:32.720 --> 2:56:34.960
 and I knew that there was language,

2:56:34.960 --> 2:56:36.520
 I could suddenly develop a state machine

2:56:36.520 --> 2:56:37.680
 that would interpret the language,

2:56:37.680 --> 2:56:42.080
 which was lossy and ambiguous and populate my abstraction.

2:56:42.080 --> 2:56:44.320
 So I built a chemical programming language

2:56:44.320 --> 2:56:46.960
 that is actually gonna be recursively enumerable.

2:56:46.960 --> 2:56:48.580
 It's gonna be a Turing complete language actually,

2:56:48.580 --> 2:56:51.500
 which is kind of cool, which means it's formally verifiable.

2:56:51.500 --> 2:56:55.280
 So where we are now is we can now read the literature

2:56:55.280 --> 2:56:56.880
 using a bit of natural language processing.

2:56:56.880 --> 2:56:57.720
 It's not the best.

2:56:57.720 --> 2:56:59.520
 There are many other groups have done a better job,

2:56:59.520 --> 2:57:01.240
 but we can use that language reading

2:57:01.240 --> 2:57:05.860
 to populate the state machine and basically add, subtract.

2:57:05.860 --> 2:57:09.440
 We got about a number of primitives that we,

2:57:09.440 --> 2:57:14.320
 basically program loops that we dovetail together

2:57:14.320 --> 2:57:15.780
 and we can make any molecule with it.

2:57:15.780 --> 2:57:18.240
 Okay, so that's the kind of program synthesis.

2:57:18.240 --> 2:57:19.920
 So you start at like literally,

2:57:19.920 --> 2:57:21.800
 you're talking about like a paper,

2:57:21.800 --> 2:57:25.400
 like a scientific paper that's being read.

2:57:25.400 --> 2:57:26.240
 Yeah.

2:57:26.240 --> 2:57:27.080
 So natural language processing,

2:57:27.080 --> 2:57:32.080
 extracting some kind of details about chemical reactions

2:57:33.320 --> 2:57:38.320
 and the chemical molecules and compounds involved.

2:57:38.320 --> 2:57:43.320
 And then that, in GPT terms,

2:57:43.960 --> 2:57:47.600
 serves as a prompt for the program synthesis

2:57:47.600 --> 2:57:49.280
 that's kind of trivial right now.

2:57:49.280 --> 2:57:51.240
 There you have a bunch of different like for loops

2:57:51.240 --> 2:57:56.080
 and so on that creates a program in this chemical language

2:57:56.080 --> 2:58:00.160
 that can then be interpreted by the chemical computer,

2:58:00.160 --> 2:58:01.720
 the computer.

2:58:01.720 --> 2:58:03.280
 Yeah, computer, that's the word.

2:58:03.280 --> 2:58:04.120
 Computer, yeah.

2:58:05.600 --> 2:58:07.840
 Everything sounds better in your British accent,

2:58:07.840 --> 2:58:09.280
 but it's, I love it.

2:58:09.280 --> 2:58:12.080
 So the, into the computer and that's able to then

2:58:12.780 --> 2:58:17.120
 basically be a 3D printer for these, for molecules.

2:58:17.120 --> 2:58:18.440
 Yeah, I wouldn't call it a 3D printer.

2:58:18.440 --> 2:58:21.040
 I would call it a universal chemical reaction system

2:58:21.040 --> 2:58:23.460
 because 3D printing gives the wrong impression, but yeah.

2:58:23.460 --> 2:58:25.200
 And it purifies.

2:58:25.200 --> 2:58:28.680
 And the nice thing is that that code now that we call it,

2:58:28.680 --> 2:58:33.680
 the KyDL code is really interesting because now,

2:58:34.520 --> 2:58:36.240
 so computation, what is computation?

2:58:36.240 --> 2:58:41.240
 Computation is what computing is to mathematics, I think.

2:58:41.320 --> 2:58:44.680
 Computation is the process of taking chemical code

2:58:44.680 --> 2:58:47.800
 and some input reagents and making the same molecule,

2:58:47.800 --> 2:58:52.160
 making the molecule reproducibly every time without fail.

2:58:52.160 --> 2:58:53.320
 What is computation?

2:58:53.320 --> 2:58:55.520
 It's the process of using a program

2:58:55.520 --> 2:58:57.720
 to take some input conditions

2:58:57.720 --> 2:59:02.220
 and give you an output same every time, right, reliably.

2:59:02.220 --> 2:59:05.640
 So the problem is, now maybe you can push back

2:59:05.640 --> 2:59:07.480
 and correct me on this.

2:59:07.480 --> 2:59:09.940
 So I know biology is messy.

2:59:09.940 --> 2:59:12.380
 My question is how messy is chemistry?

2:59:12.380 --> 2:59:15.640
 So the, if we use the analogy of a computer,

2:59:15.640 --> 2:59:20.640
 it's easier to make computation in a computer very precise,

2:59:21.920 --> 2:59:26.200
 that it's repeatable and makes errors almost never.

2:59:26.200 --> 2:59:28.440
 If it does the exact same way over and over

2:59:28.440 --> 2:59:29.520
 and over and over.

2:59:29.520 --> 2:59:30.560
 What about chemistry?

2:59:30.560 --> 2:59:32.680
 Is there messiness in the whole thing?

2:59:32.680 --> 2:59:33.920
 Can that be somehow leveraged?

2:59:33.920 --> 2:59:34.760
 Can that be controlled?

2:59:34.760 --> 2:59:36.200
 Can it be that removed,

2:59:36.200 --> 2:59:38.280
 do we wanna remove it from the system?

2:59:38.280 --> 2:59:39.680
 Oh, yes and no, right.

2:59:39.680 --> 2:59:40.640
 Is there messiness?

2:59:42.680 --> 2:59:45.000
 There is messiness because chemistry is like,

2:59:45.000 --> 2:59:49.240
 you're doing reactions on billions of molecules

2:59:49.240 --> 2:59:50.200
 and they don't always work,

2:59:50.200 --> 2:59:52.100
 but you've got purification there.

2:59:52.100 --> 2:59:54.480
 And so what we found is at the beginning,

2:59:54.480 --> 2:59:55.940
 everyone said it can't work.

2:59:55.940 --> 2:59:56.840
 It's gonna be too messy.

2:59:56.840 --> 2:59:58.040
 It will just fail.

2:59:58.040 --> 3:00:00.000
 And I said, but you managed to get chemistry

3:00:00.000 --> 3:00:00.840
 to work in the lab.

3:00:00.840 --> 3:00:01.660
 Are you magic?

3:00:01.660 --> 3:00:02.640
 Are you doing something?

3:00:02.640 --> 3:00:05.920
 So I would say, now go back to the first ever computer

3:00:05.920 --> 3:00:09.480
 or the ENIAC, 5 million soldered joints,

3:00:09.480 --> 3:00:12.760
 400,000 valves that are exploding all the time.

3:00:12.760 --> 3:00:16.360
 Was that, would you have gone, okay, that's messy.

3:00:16.360 --> 3:00:17.200
 So we've got the,

3:00:18.520 --> 3:00:21.060
 have we got the equivalent of the ENIAC in my lab?

3:00:21.060 --> 3:00:23.540
 We've got 15 computers in the lab now.

3:00:23.540 --> 3:00:24.920
 And they, are they unreliable?

3:00:24.920 --> 3:00:26.940
 Yeah, they fall apart here and there,

3:00:26.940 --> 3:00:29.540
 but are they getting better really quickly?

3:00:29.540 --> 3:00:30.380
 Yeah.

3:00:30.380 --> 3:00:32.280
 Are they now able to reliably make more,

3:00:32.280 --> 3:00:33.320
 are we at the point in the lab

3:00:33.320 --> 3:00:34.780
 where there are some molecules

3:00:34.780 --> 3:00:37.400
 we would rather make on the computer

3:00:37.400 --> 3:00:38.520
 than have a human being make?

3:00:38.520 --> 3:00:39.780
 Yeah, we've just done,

3:00:39.780 --> 3:00:44.000
 we've just made a anti influenza molecule

3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:45.420
 and some antivirals,

3:00:46.400 --> 3:00:49.720
 six steps on the computer that would take a human being

3:00:49.720 --> 3:00:54.720
 about one week to make Arbidol of continuous labor.

3:00:54.840 --> 3:00:56.160
 And all they do now is load up the reagents,

3:00:56.160 --> 3:00:58.240
 press go button and just go away and drink coffee.

3:00:58.240 --> 3:01:02.520
 Wow, so this, I mean, and this is, you're saying

3:01:02.520 --> 3:01:04.320
 this computer is just the early days.

3:01:04.320 --> 3:01:06.840
 And so like some of the criticism just have to do

3:01:06.840 --> 3:01:08.000
 with the early days.

3:01:08.000 --> 3:01:09.400
 And yes, I would say this,

3:01:09.400 --> 3:01:13.960
 something like this is quite impossible.

3:01:15.520 --> 3:01:18.120
 So the fact that you're doing this is incredible.

3:01:18.120 --> 3:01:20.760
 Not impossible, of course, but extremely difficult.

3:01:20.760 --> 3:01:22.960
 It did seem really difficult.

3:01:22.960 --> 3:01:25.080
 And I do keep pinching myself when I go in the lab.

3:01:25.080 --> 3:01:25.920
 I was like, is it working?

3:01:25.920 --> 3:01:26.740
 Like, yep.

3:01:26.740 --> 3:01:30.480
 And it's not, you know, it does clog, it does stop.

3:01:30.480 --> 3:01:32.120
 You got to clean, this is great.

3:01:32.120 --> 3:01:35.120
 It's, you know, but it's getting more reliable

3:01:35.120 --> 3:01:38.000
 because I made some, we just made design decisions

3:01:38.000 --> 3:01:40.540
 and said, we are not going to abandon the abstraction.

3:01:40.540 --> 3:01:41.380
 Think about it.

3:01:41.380 --> 3:01:45.920
 If the von Neumann implementation was abandoned,

3:01:45.920 --> 3:01:47.820
 I mean, think about what we do to semiconductors

3:01:47.820 --> 3:01:51.720
 to really constrain them to what we do to silicon

3:01:51.720 --> 3:01:55.400
 in a fab lab, we take computation for granted.

3:01:55.400 --> 3:01:57.640
 Silicon is not in its natural state.

3:01:57.640 --> 3:01:59.040
 We are doping the hell out of it.

3:01:59.040 --> 3:02:00.880
 It's incredible what they're able to accomplish

3:02:00.880 --> 3:02:03.660
 and achieve that reliability at the scale they do.

3:02:03.660 --> 3:02:07.600
 Like you said, that's after Moore's law, what we have now.

3:02:07.600 --> 3:02:12.600
 And where we, you know, how it started, you know,

3:02:13.200 --> 3:02:14.040
 now we're here.

3:02:14.040 --> 3:02:15.480
 We started at the bottom, now we're here.

3:02:15.480 --> 3:02:17.080
 We have only have 20 million molecules.

3:02:17.080 --> 3:02:19.600
 Well, say 20 million molecules in one database,

3:02:19.600 --> 3:02:21.280
 maybe a few hundred million

3:02:21.280 --> 3:02:23.440
 in all the pharmaceutical companies.

3:02:23.440 --> 3:02:26.680
 And those few hundred million molecules are responsible

3:02:26.680 --> 3:02:28.600
 for all the drugs that we've had in humanity,

3:02:28.600 --> 3:02:32.320
 except, you know, biologics for the last 50 years.

3:02:32.320 --> 3:02:35.500
 Now imagine what happens when a drug goes out of print,

3:02:35.500 --> 3:02:37.440
 goes out of print because there's only a finite number

3:02:37.440 --> 3:02:38.760
 of manufacturing facilities in the world

3:02:38.760 --> 3:02:39.600
 that make these drugs.

3:02:39.600 --> 3:02:40.440
 It goes out of print.

3:02:40.440 --> 3:02:41.280
 Yeah.

3:02:41.280 --> 3:02:42.120
 Isn't that computer?

3:02:42.120 --> 3:02:44.080
 This is a printing press, but for chemistry.

3:02:44.080 --> 3:02:45.120
 Yeah.

3:02:45.120 --> 3:02:47.480
 And not only that, we can protect the KyDL

3:02:47.480 --> 3:02:49.120
 so we can stop bad actors doing it.

3:02:49.120 --> 3:02:51.520
 We can encrypt them and we can give people license.

3:02:51.520 --> 3:02:53.640
 KyDL, that's the name, sorry to interrupt,

3:02:53.640 --> 3:02:54.480
 is the name of the programming language?

3:02:54.480 --> 3:02:56.720
 Yeah, the KyDL is the name of the programming language

3:02:56.720 --> 3:02:58.520
 and the code we give the chemicals.

3:02:58.520 --> 3:03:01.960
 So Ky, as in, you know, just for,

3:03:01.960 --> 3:03:04.120
 it's actually like an XML format,

3:03:04.120 --> 3:03:06.480
 but I've now taken it from script

3:03:06.480 --> 3:03:10.200
 to a fully expressible programming language

3:03:10.200 --> 3:03:12.680
 so we can do dynamics and there's for loops in there

3:03:12.680 --> 3:03:13.840
 and conditional statements.

3:03:13.840 --> 3:03:18.800
 Right, but the structure, it started out as like an XML

3:03:18.800 --> 3:03:19.640
 type of thing.

3:03:19.640 --> 3:03:20.460
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3:03:20.460 --> 3:03:22.360
 And also, the chemist doesn't need to program in KyDL.

3:03:22.360 --> 3:03:25.160
 They can just go to the software and type in add A to B,

3:03:25.160 --> 3:03:27.180
 reflux, do what they would normally do,

3:03:27.180 --> 3:03:28.480
 and it just converts it to KyDL

3:03:28.480 --> 3:03:30.520
 and they have a linter to check it and error correct.

3:03:30.520 --> 3:03:34.320
 So how do you, you know, not with ASCII,

3:03:34.320 --> 3:03:36.480
 but because it's a Greek letter,

3:03:36.480 --> 3:03:39.720
 how do you go with, how do you spell it

3:03:39.720 --> 3:03:42.280
 just using the English alphabet?

3:03:42.280 --> 3:03:43.680
 We just, XDL?

3:03:43.680 --> 3:03:46.000
 XDL, but all we use, we put in Ky.

3:03:46.000 --> 3:03:47.560
 And it was named by one of my students

3:03:47.560 --> 3:03:49.920
 and one of my postdocs many years ago

3:03:49.920 --> 3:03:50.960
 and I quite liked it.

3:03:50.960 --> 3:03:53.520
 It's like, it's important, I think,

3:03:53.520 --> 3:03:55.640
 when the team are contributing to such big ideas,

3:03:55.640 --> 3:03:57.520
 cause there's their ideas as well.

3:03:57.520 --> 3:04:00.520
 I try not to just rename, I didn't call it Cronon

3:04:00.520 --> 3:04:03.000
 or anything that, cause they keep saying, you know,

3:04:03.000 --> 3:04:07.380
 is the chemistry, when they're putting stuff

3:04:07.380 --> 3:04:08.880
 in the computer, one of my students said,

3:04:08.880 --> 3:04:10.640
 we're asking now, is it Cronon complete?

3:04:10.640 --> 3:04:11.480
 And I was like, what does that mean?

3:04:11.480 --> 3:04:13.880
 I said, well, can we make it on the damn machine?

3:04:13.880 --> 3:04:18.440
 And I was like, oh, is that a compliment or a majority?

3:04:18.440 --> 3:04:20.720
 But they're like, well, it might be both.

3:04:21.680 --> 3:04:24.600
 Yeah, so you tweeted, quote,

3:04:24.600 --> 3:04:27.440
 why does chemistry need a universal programming language,

3:04:27.440 --> 3:04:28.280
 question mark?

3:04:29.640 --> 3:04:31.840
 For all the reasons you can think of.

3:04:31.840 --> 3:04:35.740
 Reliability, interoperability, collaboration,

3:04:35.740 --> 3:04:39.120
 remove ambiguity, lower cost, increase safety,

3:04:39.120 --> 3:04:42.360
 open up discovery, molecular customization,

3:04:42.360 --> 3:04:46.300
 and publication of executable chemical code.

3:04:46.300 --> 3:04:49.140
 Which is fascinating, by the way.

3:04:49.140 --> 3:04:51.980
 Just publish code.

3:04:51.980 --> 3:04:56.260
 And can you maybe elaborate a little bit more

3:04:56.260 --> 3:04:59.480
 about this CHI DL, what does the universal language

3:04:59.480 --> 3:05:01.480
 of chemistry look like?

3:05:01.480 --> 3:05:04.820
 A Cronon complete language.

3:05:04.820 --> 3:05:07.380
 It's a Turing complete language, really.

3:05:07.380 --> 3:05:11.040
 But, so what it has, it has a series of operators in it,

3:05:11.040 --> 3:05:14.040
 like add, heat, stir.

3:05:14.040 --> 3:05:17.960
 So there's a bunch of unit operations.

3:05:17.960 --> 3:05:19.560
 And all it is, really, is just,

3:05:19.560 --> 3:05:21.880
 it's with chemical engineers,

3:05:21.880 --> 3:05:22.720
 when I talked about this,

3:05:22.720 --> 3:05:26.000
 that you've just rediscovered chemical engineering.

3:05:26.000 --> 3:05:27.760
 And I said, well, yeah, I know.

3:05:27.760 --> 3:05:30.120
 I said, well, that's trivial.

3:05:30.120 --> 3:05:31.840
 I said, well, not really.

3:05:31.840 --> 3:05:33.680
 Well, yes, it is trivial, and that's why it's good,

3:05:33.680 --> 3:05:36.840
 because not only have we rediscovered chemical engineering,

3:05:36.840 --> 3:05:38.940
 we've made it implementable on the universal hardware

3:05:38.940 --> 3:05:40.720
 that doesn't cost very much money.

3:05:40.720 --> 3:05:43.960
 And so the CHI DL has a series of statements.

3:05:43.960 --> 3:05:46.160
 Like define the reactor.

3:05:46.160 --> 3:05:49.320
 So defines the reagents.

3:05:49.320 --> 3:05:52.160
 So they're all labels, so you assign them.

3:05:52.160 --> 3:05:55.440
 And what I also implemented at the beginning is,

3:05:55.440 --> 3:05:57.980
 because I give all the hardware IP address,

3:05:57.980 --> 3:05:59.400
 you put it on a graph.

3:05:59.400 --> 3:06:02.280
 And so what it does is like the graph is equivalent

3:06:02.280 --> 3:06:06.600
 to the processor firmware, the processor code.

3:06:06.600 --> 3:06:08.600
 So when you take your CHI DL,

3:06:08.600 --> 3:06:10.160
 and you go to run it on your computer,

3:06:10.160 --> 3:06:12.040
 you can run it on any compatible hardware

3:06:12.040 --> 3:06:14.840
 in any configuration, it says, what does your graph look like?

3:06:14.840 --> 3:06:17.000
 As long as I can solve the problem on the graph

3:06:17.000 --> 3:06:17.840
 with these unit operations,

3:06:17.840 --> 3:06:20.360
 and you have the resources available, it can compile.

3:06:20.360 --> 3:06:21.680
 Chem piles.

3:06:21.680 --> 3:06:22.520
 Ah ha.

3:06:22.520 --> 3:06:23.360
 Ha ha ha.

3:06:23.360 --> 3:06:24.200
 Ha ha ha.

3:06:24.200 --> 3:06:25.640
 Oh.

3:06:25.640 --> 3:06:27.080
 All right, we can carry on for years.

3:06:27.080 --> 3:06:29.080
 But it is really, it's chempilation.

3:06:29.080 --> 3:06:29.920
 Chempilation, yeah.

3:06:29.920 --> 3:06:32.740
 And what it now does is it says, okay,

3:06:32.740 --> 3:06:35.440
 the problem we have before is it was possible

3:06:35.440 --> 3:06:37.800
 to do robotics for chemistry,

3:06:37.800 --> 3:06:39.440
 but the robots were really expensive.

3:06:39.440 --> 3:06:40.600
 They were unique.

3:06:40.600 --> 3:06:42.800
 They were vendor locked.

3:06:42.800 --> 3:06:44.520
 And what I want to do is to make sure

3:06:44.520 --> 3:06:46.880
 that every chemist in the world can get access

3:06:46.880 --> 3:06:49.960
 to machinery like this at virtually no cost,

3:06:49.960 --> 3:06:51.800
 because it makes it safer.

3:06:51.800 --> 3:06:53.720
 It makes it more reliable.

3:06:53.720 --> 3:06:55.280
 And then if you go to the literature

3:06:55.280 --> 3:06:58.360
 and you find a molecule that could potentially cure cancer,

3:06:58.360 --> 3:06:59.840
 and let's say the molecule that could potentially

3:06:59.840 --> 3:07:03.000
 cure cancer takes you three years to repeat,

3:07:03.000 --> 3:07:06.560
 and maybe a student finishes their PhD in the time

3:07:06.560 --> 3:07:07.920
 and they never get it back.

3:07:07.920 --> 3:07:12.720
 So that it's really hard to kind of get all the way

3:07:12.720 --> 3:07:14.480
 to that molecule, and it limits the ability

3:07:14.480 --> 3:07:16.400
 of humanity to build on it.

3:07:16.400 --> 3:07:19.000
 If they just download the code and can execute it,

3:07:19.000 --> 3:07:22.680
 it turns, I would say the electronic laboratory notebook

3:07:22.680 --> 3:07:25.240
 in chemistry is a data cemetery,

3:07:26.440 --> 3:07:28.560
 because no one will ever reproduce it.

3:07:28.560 --> 3:07:30.900
 For now, the data cemetery is a Jupiter notebook

3:07:30.900 --> 3:07:31.740
 and you can just execute it.

3:07:31.740 --> 3:07:33.600
 A notebook and people can play with it,

3:07:33.600 --> 3:07:34.640
 the access to it.

3:07:34.640 --> 3:07:35.480
 Reversion it.

3:07:35.480 --> 3:07:37.680
 Orders of magnitude is increased.

3:07:37.680 --> 3:07:41.480
 We'll talk about the, so as with all technologies,

3:07:41.480 --> 3:07:43.800
 I think there's way more exciting possibilities,

3:07:43.800 --> 3:07:45.660
 but there are also terrifying possibilities,

3:07:45.660 --> 3:07:47.400
 and we'll talk about all of them.

3:07:47.400 --> 3:07:50.920
 But let me just kind of linger on the machine learning

3:07:50.920 --> 3:07:51.760
 side of this.

3:07:51.760 --> 3:07:53.480
 So you're describing programming,

3:07:53.480 --> 3:07:57.480
 but it's a language, I don't know if you've heard

3:07:57.480 --> 3:07:59.400
 about OpenAI Codex, which is.

3:07:59.400 --> 3:08:00.600
 Yeah, I'm playing with it.

3:08:00.600 --> 3:08:02.560
 You're playing, of course you are.

3:08:02.560 --> 3:08:07.560
 Yeah, you really are Rick from Rick and Morty.

3:08:07.960 --> 3:08:08.800
 This is great.

3:08:08.800 --> 3:08:12.160
 Okay, except philosophically deep.

3:08:12.160 --> 3:08:14.980
 I mean, he is, I guess, kind of philosophically deep too.

3:08:14.980 --> 3:08:18.540
 So for people who don't know, GPT, GPT3,

3:08:18.540 --> 3:08:21.560
 that's a language model that can do natural language

3:08:21.560 --> 3:08:23.920
 generation, so you can give it a prompt

3:08:23.920 --> 3:08:26.440
 and it can complete the rest of it.

3:08:26.440 --> 3:08:28.920
 But it turns out that that kind of prompt,

3:08:28.920 --> 3:08:30.760
 it's not just completes the rest of it,

3:08:30.760 --> 3:08:35.760
 it's generating like novel sounding text,

3:08:36.440 --> 3:08:38.280
 and then you can apply that to generation

3:08:38.280 --> 3:08:40.700
 of other kinds of stuff.

3:08:40.700 --> 3:08:43.920
 So these kinds of transformer based language models

3:08:43.920 --> 3:08:48.920
 are really good at forming deep representations

3:08:49.720 --> 3:08:54.440
 of a particular space, like a medium, like language.

3:08:54.440 --> 3:08:56.900
 So you can then apply it to specific subset of language

3:08:56.900 --> 3:09:00.840
 like programming, so you can have it learn

3:09:00.840 --> 3:09:03.200
 the representation of the Python programming language

3:09:03.200 --> 3:09:06.560
 and use it to then generate syntactically

3:09:06.560 --> 3:09:10.440
 and semantically correct programs.

3:09:10.440 --> 3:09:13.000
 So you can start to make progress on one of the hardest

3:09:13.000 --> 3:09:16.080
 problems in computer science, which is program synthesis.

3:09:16.080 --> 3:09:19.640
 How do you write programs that accomplish different tasks?

3:09:19.640 --> 3:09:24.640
 So what OpenAI Codex does is it to generate

3:09:24.640 --> 3:09:28.700
 those programs based on a prompt of some kind.

3:09:28.700 --> 3:09:30.780
 Usually you can do a natural language prompt,

3:09:30.780 --> 3:09:32.780
 so basically as you do when you program,

3:09:32.780 --> 3:09:37.780
 you write some comment which serves the basic documentation

3:09:37.940 --> 3:09:40.100
 of the inputs and the outputs and the function

3:09:40.100 --> 3:09:41.660
 of the particular set of code and it's able

3:09:41.660 --> 3:09:43.300
 to generate that.

3:09:43.300 --> 3:09:45.820
 Point being is you can generate programs

3:09:46.740 --> 3:09:49.660
 using machine learning, using neural networks.

3:09:49.660 --> 3:09:54.660
 Those programs operate on the boring old computer.

3:09:56.980 --> 3:09:59.580
 Can you generate programs that operate,

3:09:59.580 --> 3:10:01.700
 this gotta be a clever version of programs for this,

3:10:01.700 --> 3:10:06.460
 but can you write programs that operate on a computer?

3:10:06.460 --> 3:10:08.780
 Yep, there's actually software out there right now

3:10:08.780 --> 3:10:10.340
 you can go and do it.

3:10:10.340 --> 3:10:11.180
 Really?

3:10:11.180 --> 3:10:14.300
 Yeah, yeah, it's a heuristic, it's rule based,

3:10:14.300 --> 3:10:19.300
 but we have, what we've done, inspired by Codex actually,

3:10:20.340 --> 3:10:23.540
 is over the summer I ran a little workshop.

3:10:23.540 --> 3:10:25.140
 Some of my groups got this inspired idea

3:10:25.140 --> 3:10:28.060
 that we should get a load of students

3:10:28.060 --> 3:10:30.660
 and ask them to manually collect data,

3:10:30.660 --> 3:10:35.220
 to label chemical procedures into Kydy L.

3:10:35.220 --> 3:10:38.820
 And we have a cool synth reader.

3:10:38.820 --> 3:10:41.940
 So there's a bunch of people doing this right now,

3:10:41.940 --> 3:10:45.140
 but they're doing it without abstraction.

3:10:46.120 --> 3:10:47.460
 And because we have an abstraction

3:10:47.460 --> 3:10:50.260
 that's implementable in the hardware,

3:10:50.260 --> 3:10:54.900
 we've developed basically a chemical analog of Codex.

3:10:54.900 --> 3:10:56.900
 When you say, sorry to interrupt,

3:10:56.900 --> 3:10:59.900
 when you say abstraction in the hardware, what do you mean?

3:10:59.900 --> 3:11:01.800
 So right now, a lot of people doing machine learning

3:11:01.800 --> 3:11:04.480
 and reading chemistry and saying,

3:11:04.480 --> 3:11:05.980
 oh, you've got all these operations,

3:11:05.980 --> 3:11:07.840
 add, shake, whatever, heat.

3:11:07.840 --> 3:11:11.260
 But because they don't have a uniform,

3:11:11.260 --> 3:11:12.820
 I mean, it's a couple of groups doing it,

3:11:12.820 --> 3:11:15.660
 competitors actually, and they're good, very good.

3:11:15.660 --> 3:11:20.500
 But they can't run that code automatically.

3:11:20.500 --> 3:11:23.720
 They are losing meaning.

3:11:24.800 --> 3:11:28.300
 And the really important thing that you have to do

3:11:28.300 --> 3:11:29.980
 is generate context.

3:11:29.980 --> 3:11:32.780
 And so what we've learned to do with our abstraction

3:11:32.780 --> 3:11:36.380
 is make sure we can pull the context out of the text.

3:11:36.380 --> 3:11:40.500
 And so can we take a chemical procedure

3:11:40.500 --> 3:11:42.840
 and read it and generate our executable code?

3:11:42.840 --> 3:11:43.960
 Yes.

3:11:43.960 --> 3:11:45.980
 What's the hardest part about that whole pipeline

3:11:45.980 --> 3:11:48.300
 from the initial text, interpreting the initial text

3:11:48.300 --> 3:11:52.240
 of a paper, extracting the meaningful context

3:11:52.240 --> 3:11:54.380
 and the meaningful chemical information

3:11:54.380 --> 3:11:56.780
 to then generating the program

3:11:56.780 --> 3:12:00.300
 to then running that program in the hardware?

3:12:00.300 --> 3:12:02.340
 What's the hardest part about that pipeline

3:12:02.340 --> 3:12:05.780
 as we look towards a universal Turing computer?

3:12:05.780 --> 3:12:10.580
 So the hardest thing with the pipeline

3:12:10.580 --> 3:12:15.580
 is that the software, the model gets confused

3:12:16.500 --> 3:12:18.300
 between some meanings, right?

3:12:18.300 --> 3:12:21.700
 So if, you know, chemists are very good at inventing words

3:12:21.700 --> 3:12:22.840
 that aren't broken down.

3:12:22.840 --> 3:12:25.960
 So I would, the classic word that you would use

3:12:25.960 --> 3:12:28.200
 for boiling something is called reflux.

3:12:28.200 --> 3:12:31.020
 So reflux is, you would have a solvent

3:12:31.020 --> 3:12:33.720
 in a round bottom flask, at reflux it would be boiling,

3:12:33.720 --> 3:12:35.980
 going up the reflux condenser and coming down.

3:12:35.980 --> 3:12:40.180
 But that term reflux to reflux could be changed, you know,

3:12:40.180 --> 3:12:44.300
 to people often make up words, new words,

3:12:44.300 --> 3:12:47.340
 and then the software can fall over.

3:12:47.340 --> 3:12:50.940
 But what we've been able to do is a bit like in Python

3:12:50.940 --> 3:12:53.380
 or any programming language is identify

3:12:53.380 --> 3:12:55.100
 when things aren't matched.

3:12:55.100 --> 3:12:57.340
 So you present the code and you say, this isn't matched.

3:12:57.340 --> 3:12:58.540
 You may want to think about this.

3:12:58.540 --> 3:13:01.100
 And then the user goes and says, oh, I mean reflux

3:13:01.100 --> 3:13:02.660
 and just ticks a box and collects it.

3:13:02.660 --> 3:13:07.660
 So what the Codex or the Chemex does in this case

3:13:08.520 --> 3:13:12.500
 is it just, it suggests the first go

3:13:12.500 --> 3:13:14.100
 and then the chemist goes in and corrects it.

3:13:14.100 --> 3:13:16.220
 And I really want the chemist to correct it

3:13:16.220 --> 3:13:21.220
 because it's not safe, I believe, for it to allow AI

3:13:21.980 --> 3:13:25.060
 to just read literature and generate code at this stage.

3:13:25.060 --> 3:13:28.540
 Because now you're having actual, by the way, Chemex,

3:13:28.540 --> 3:13:33.540
 nice, nice name, so you are unlike, which is fascinating.

3:13:38.920 --> 3:13:42.340
 It's that we live in a fascinating moment in human history.

3:13:42.340 --> 3:13:47.020
 But yes, you're literally connecting AI

3:13:47.020 --> 3:13:52.020
 to some physical and like it's building something

3:13:52.140 --> 3:13:55.180
 in the physical realm, especially in the space

3:13:55.180 --> 3:14:00.180
 of chemistry that operates sort of invisibly.

3:14:02.660 --> 3:14:05.500
 Yeah, yeah, I would say that's right.

3:14:05.500 --> 3:14:07.420
 And it's really important to understand

3:14:07.420 --> 3:14:09.280
 those labeling schemes, right?

3:14:09.280 --> 3:14:11.340
 And one of the things I was never,

3:14:11.340 --> 3:14:12.700
 I was always worried about the beginning

3:14:12.700 --> 3:14:15.260
 that the abstraction was gonna fall over.

3:14:15.260 --> 3:14:18.340
 And the way we did it was just by brute force to start with.

3:14:18.340 --> 3:14:19.880
 We just kept reading the literature and saying,

3:14:19.880 --> 3:14:20.720
 is there anything new?

3:14:20.720 --> 3:14:21.740
 Can we add a new rule in?

3:14:21.740 --> 3:14:25.380
 And actually our KyDL language expanded, exploded.

3:14:25.380 --> 3:14:28.140
 There was so many extra things we had to keep adding.

3:14:28.140 --> 3:14:31.140
 And then I realized the primitives still were maintained

3:14:31.140 --> 3:14:32.640
 and I could break them down again.

3:14:32.640 --> 3:14:35.100
 So it's pretty good.

3:14:35.100 --> 3:14:36.120
 I mean, there are problems.

3:14:36.120 --> 3:14:38.500
 There are problems of interpreting any big sentence

3:14:38.500 --> 3:14:40.700
 and turning it into an actionable code.

3:14:40.700 --> 3:14:42.300
 And in Codex, it's not without its problems.

3:14:42.300 --> 3:14:44.080
 You can crash it quite easily, right?

3:14:44.080 --> 3:14:45.540
 You can generate nonsense.

3:14:45.540 --> 3:14:47.680
 But boy, it's interesting.

3:14:47.680 --> 3:14:52.680
 I would love to learn to program now using Codex, right?

3:14:52.780 --> 3:14:54.180
 Just hacking around, right?

3:14:54.180 --> 3:14:55.940
 And I wonder if chemists in the future will learn

3:14:55.940 --> 3:15:00.940
 to do chemistry by just hacking around with the system

3:15:01.220 --> 3:15:02.140
 and writing different things.

3:15:02.140 --> 3:15:04.300
 Because the key thing that we're doing with the chemistry

3:15:04.300 --> 3:15:07.220
 is that where a lot of mathematical chemistry went wrong

3:15:07.220 --> 3:15:11.540
 is people, and I think Wolfram does this in Mathematica,

3:15:11.540 --> 3:15:15.660
 he assumes that chemistry is a reaction where atom A

3:15:15.660 --> 3:15:17.460
 or molecule A reacts with molecule B

3:15:17.460 --> 3:15:18.300
 to give molecule C.

3:15:18.300 --> 3:15:20.460
 That's not what chemistry is.

3:15:20.460 --> 3:15:23.100
 Chemistry is take some molecule,

3:15:23.100 --> 3:15:26.740
 take a liquid or a solid, mix it up and heat it

3:15:27.740 --> 3:15:29.380
 and then extract it.

3:15:29.380 --> 3:15:32.540
 So the programming language is actually with respect

3:15:32.540 --> 3:15:35.380
 to the process operations.

3:15:35.380 --> 3:15:37.800
 And if you flick in process space,

3:15:37.800 --> 3:15:41.500
 not in chemical graph space, you unlock everything

3:15:41.500 --> 3:15:43.220
 because there's only a finite number of processes

3:15:43.220 --> 3:15:45.180
 you need to do in chemistry.

3:15:45.180 --> 3:15:47.220
 And that's reassuring.

3:15:47.220 --> 3:15:50.420
 And so we're in the middle of it, it's really exciting.

3:15:51.620 --> 3:15:53.620
 It's not the be all and the end all.

3:15:53.620 --> 3:15:55.800
 And there is like I say, errors that can creep in.

3:15:55.800 --> 3:15:58.620
 One day we might be able to do it without human interaction

3:15:58.620 --> 3:15:59.460
 and you simulate it.

3:15:59.460 --> 3:16:01.500
 And you'll know enough about the simulation

3:16:01.500 --> 3:16:05.420
 that the lab won't catch fire.

3:16:05.420 --> 3:16:07.060
 But there are so many safety issues right now

3:16:07.060 --> 3:16:09.740
 that we've got to really be very careful,

3:16:09.740 --> 3:16:11.940
 protecting the user, protecting the environment,

3:16:11.940 --> 3:16:13.040
 protecting misuse.

3:16:13.040 --> 3:16:14.880
 I mean, there's lots to discuss

3:16:14.880 --> 3:16:16.100
 if you want to go down that route

3:16:16.100 --> 3:16:17.620
 because it's very, very interesting.

3:16:17.620 --> 3:16:20.620
 You don't want Novichoks being made

3:16:20.620 --> 3:16:25.620
 or explosives being made or recreational drugs being made.

3:16:26.340 --> 3:16:30.380
 But how do you stop a molecular biologist making a drug

3:16:30.380 --> 3:16:32.100
 that's gonna be important for them looking

3:16:32.100 --> 3:16:35.260
 at their particular assay

3:16:35.260 --> 3:16:38.940
 on a bad actor trying to make methamphetamine?

3:16:38.940 --> 3:16:41.100
 I saw how you looked at me when you said bad actor,

3:16:41.100 --> 3:16:42.940
 but that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

3:16:42.940 --> 3:16:45.460
 I'm trying to get the details of this so I can be first.

3:16:45.460 --> 3:16:47.460
 Don't worry, we can protect you from yourself.

3:16:47.460 --> 3:16:48.300
 Okay.

3:16:50.180 --> 3:16:54.060
 I'm not sure that's true, but that statement gives me hope.

3:16:54.060 --> 3:16:59.060
 Does this ultimately excite you about the future

3:17:00.660 --> 3:17:01.980
 or does it terrify you?

3:17:01.980 --> 3:17:06.980
 So let's, we mentioned that time is fundamental.

3:17:07.120 --> 3:17:12.120
 It seems like you're at the cutting edge of progress

3:17:12.120 --> 3:17:15.760
 that will have to happen, that will happen,

3:17:15.760 --> 3:17:17.340
 that there's no stopping it.

3:17:18.640 --> 3:17:20.800
 And I, as we've been talking about,

3:17:20.800 --> 3:17:24.640
 I see obviously a huge number of exciting possibilities.

3:17:24.640 --> 3:17:29.280
 So whenever you automate these kinds of things,

3:17:29.280 --> 3:17:31.400
 just the world opens up.

3:17:31.400 --> 3:17:34.600
 It's like programming itself and the computer,

3:17:34.600 --> 3:17:39.520
 regular computer, has created innumerable applications.

3:17:39.520 --> 3:17:43.600
 It made the world better in so many dimensions.

3:17:43.600 --> 3:17:45.960
 And it created, of course, a lot of negative things

3:17:45.960 --> 3:17:48.960
 that we, for some reason, like to focus on

3:17:48.960 --> 3:17:52.400
 using that very technology to tweet about it.

3:17:52.400 --> 3:17:55.500
 But I think it made a much better world,

3:17:55.500 --> 3:17:57.600
 but it created a lot of new dangers.

3:17:57.600 --> 3:18:02.600
 So maybe you can speak to when you have,

3:18:02.600 --> 3:18:07.600
 when you kind of stand at the end of the road

3:18:07.600 --> 3:18:12.600
 for building a really solid, reliable, universal computer.

3:18:14.480 --> 3:18:16.400
 What are the possibilities that are positive?

3:18:16.400 --> 3:18:18.120
 What are the possibilities that are negative?

3:18:18.120 --> 3:18:21.080
 How can we minimize the chance of the negative?

3:18:21.080 --> 3:18:22.460
 Yeah, that's a really good question.

3:18:22.460 --> 3:18:23.960
 So there's so many positive things,

3:18:23.960 --> 3:18:28.760
 from drug discovery, from supply chain stress,

3:18:28.760 --> 3:18:30.680
 for basically enabling chemists

3:18:30.680 --> 3:18:32.600
 to basically build more productive in the lab, right?

3:18:32.600 --> 3:18:35.320
 Where this is, the computer's not gonna replace the chemist.

3:18:35.320 --> 3:18:37.400
 There's gonna be a Moore's law of molecules, right?

3:18:37.400 --> 3:18:39.760
 There's gonna be so many more molecules we can design,

3:18:39.760 --> 3:18:41.560
 so many more diseases we can cure.

3:18:41.560 --> 3:18:43.420
 So chemists in the lab as researchers,

3:18:43.420 --> 3:18:44.740
 that's better for science.

3:18:44.740 --> 3:18:46.520
 So they can build a bunch of,

3:18:47.920 --> 3:18:50.400
 like they could do science at a much more accelerated pace.

3:18:50.400 --> 3:18:51.960
 So it's not just the development of drugs,

3:18:51.960 --> 3:18:54.300
 it's actually like doing the basic understanding

3:18:54.300 --> 3:18:55.200
 and the science of drugs.

3:18:55.200 --> 3:18:57.760
 And the personalization, the cost of drugs right now,

3:18:57.760 --> 3:19:00.360
 we're all living longer, we're all having more and more,

3:19:00.360 --> 3:19:02.320
 we know more about our genomic development,

3:19:02.320 --> 3:19:05.000
 we know about our predetermination,

3:19:05.000 --> 3:19:06.440
 and we might be able to,

3:19:06.440 --> 3:19:07.920
 one dream I've got is like,

3:19:07.920 --> 3:19:11.880
 imagine you can work at your genome assistant

3:19:11.880 --> 3:19:14.600
 tells you you're gonna get cancer in seven years time,

3:19:14.600 --> 3:19:16.800
 and you have your personal computer

3:19:16.800 --> 3:19:20.060
 that cooks up the right molecule just for you to cure it,

3:19:20.060 --> 3:19:20.900
 right?

3:19:20.900 --> 3:19:22.480
 That's a really positive idea.

3:19:22.480 --> 3:19:25.240
 The other thing is when drugs,

3:19:25.240 --> 3:19:28.640
 so right now I think it's absolutely outrageous

3:19:28.640 --> 3:19:33.140
 that not all of humanity has access to medicine.

3:19:33.140 --> 3:19:34.780
 And I think the computer

3:19:34.780 --> 3:19:36.020
 might be able to change that fundamentally

3:19:36.020 --> 3:19:38.960
 because it will disrupt the way things are manufactured.

3:19:38.960 --> 3:19:40.860
 So let's stop thinking about manufacturing

3:19:40.860 --> 3:19:41.900
 in different factories.

3:19:41.900 --> 3:19:44.420
 Let's say that computers,

3:19:44.420 --> 3:19:47.040
 clinical grade computers or drug grade computers

3:19:47.040 --> 3:19:49.760
 will be in facilities all around the world,

3:19:49.760 --> 3:19:52.720
 and they can make things on demand

3:19:52.720 --> 3:19:54.440
 as a function of the cost.

3:19:54.440 --> 3:19:55.640
 Maybe people won't be able to afford

3:19:55.640 --> 3:19:57.200
 the latest and greatest patent,

3:19:57.200 --> 3:20:00.160
 but maybe they'll be able to get the next best thing

3:20:00.160 --> 3:20:02.800
 and will basically democratize,

3:20:02.800 --> 3:20:06.640
 make available drugs to everybody that they need.

3:20:06.640 --> 3:20:10.560
 And there's lots of really interesting things there.

3:20:10.560 --> 3:20:12.520
 So I think that's gonna happen.

3:20:12.520 --> 3:20:16.980
 I think that now let's take the negative.

3:20:16.980 --> 3:20:18.260
 Before we do that,

3:20:18.260 --> 3:20:19.480
 let's imagine what happened,

3:20:19.480 --> 3:20:21.920
 go back to a really tragic accident a few years ago,

3:20:21.920 --> 3:20:23.000
 well not accident,

3:20:23.000 --> 3:20:26.080
 an act of murder by that pilot on the,

3:20:26.080 --> 3:20:28.360
 I think it was Eurowings or Swisswings.

3:20:28.360 --> 3:20:30.700
 But what he did is plane took off,

3:20:30.700 --> 3:20:33.500
 he waited till his pilot went to the toilet,

3:20:33.500 --> 3:20:34.340
 he was a co pilot,

3:20:34.340 --> 3:20:37.780
 he locked the door and then set the autopilot

3:20:39.180 --> 3:20:40.020
 above the Alps,

3:20:40.020 --> 3:20:44.200
 he set the altimeter or the descend height to zero.

3:20:44.200 --> 3:20:48.100
 So the computer just took the plane into the Alps.

3:20:48.100 --> 3:20:51.500
 Now, I mean, that was such a tragedy

3:20:51.500 --> 3:20:53.180
 that obviously the guy was mentally ill,

3:20:53.180 --> 3:20:55.100
 but it wasn't just a tragedy for him,

3:20:55.100 --> 3:20:57.060
 it was for all the people on board.

3:20:57.060 --> 3:20:58.940
 But what if, and I was inspired by this

3:20:58.940 --> 3:21:03.140
 and my thinking, what can I do to anticipate

3:21:03.140 --> 3:21:05.260
 problems like this in the computer?

3:21:05.260 --> 3:21:06.900
 Had the software,

3:21:06.900 --> 3:21:09.300
 and I'm sure Boeing and Airbus will be thinking,

3:21:09.300 --> 3:21:11.260
 oh, maybe I can give the computer

3:21:11.260 --> 3:21:12.660
 a bit more situational awareness.

3:21:12.660 --> 3:21:15.660
 So whenever one tries to drop the height of the plane

3:21:15.660 --> 3:21:16.860
 and it knows it's above the Alps,

3:21:16.860 --> 3:21:18.460
 we'll just say, oh no, computer says no,

3:21:18.460 --> 3:21:20.540
 we're not letting you do that.

3:21:20.540 --> 3:21:22.240
 Of course, he would have been able to find another way,

3:21:22.240 --> 3:21:24.260
 maybe fly it until it runs out of fuel or something,

3:21:24.260 --> 3:21:25.340
 but you know.

3:21:25.340 --> 3:21:28.820
 Keep anticipating all the large number of trajectories

3:21:28.820 --> 3:21:29.660
 that can go negative,

3:21:29.660 --> 3:21:31.420
 all those kinds of running into the Alps

3:21:31.420 --> 3:21:35.700
 and try to at least make it easy

3:21:35.700 --> 3:21:38.500
 for the engineers to build systems that are protecting us.

3:21:38.500 --> 3:21:40.460
 Yeah, and let's just think,

3:21:40.460 --> 3:21:43.020
 what in the computer world right now with Kydeals,

3:21:43.020 --> 3:21:45.020
 let's just not think about what I'm doing right now.

3:21:45.020 --> 3:21:47.100
 What I'm doing right now is it's completely open, right?

3:21:47.100 --> 3:21:48.980
 Everyone's gonna know Kydeals and be playing with them,

3:21:48.980 --> 3:21:51.340
 making them more easier and easier and easier.

3:21:51.340 --> 3:21:53.020
 But what we're gonna start to do,

3:21:53.020 --> 3:21:58.020
 it makes sense to encrypt the Kydeals in such a way,

3:21:59.060 --> 3:22:01.180
 let's say you work for a pharmaceutical company

3:22:01.180 --> 3:22:03.580
 and you have a license to make given molecule,

3:22:03.580 --> 3:22:05.220
 well, you get issued with a license

3:22:05.220 --> 3:22:07.460
 by the FDA or your local authority

3:22:07.460 --> 3:22:08.940
 and they'll say, right, your license to do it,

3:22:08.940 --> 3:22:12.380
 here it is, it's encrypted and the Kydeal gets run.

3:22:12.380 --> 3:22:15.460
 So you have a license for that instance of use, easy to do.

3:22:15.460 --> 3:22:17.620
 Computer science has already solved the problem.

3:22:17.620 --> 3:22:21.260
 So the fact that we all trust online banking, right,

3:22:21.260 --> 3:22:23.100
 the right now, then we can secure it.

3:22:23.100 --> 3:22:26.580
 I'm 100% sure we can secure the computer.

3:22:26.580 --> 3:22:28.620
 And because of the way we have a many,

3:22:28.620 --> 3:22:32.700
 it's like the same mapping problem that you,

3:22:32.700 --> 3:22:34.460
 to actually reverse engineer a Kydeal

3:22:34.460 --> 3:22:37.380
 will be as hard as reverse engineering the encryption key,

3:22:38.740 --> 3:22:40.260
 brute force, it will be cheaper

3:22:41.260 --> 3:22:44.420
 to just actually buy the regulated medicine.

3:22:44.420 --> 3:22:46.900
 And actually people aren't gonna want to then

3:22:46.900 --> 3:22:49.380
 make their own fake pharmaceuticals

3:22:49.380 --> 3:22:51.380
 because it'll be so cheap to do it.

3:22:51.380 --> 3:22:53.700
 We'll drop the cost of access to drugs.

3:22:53.700 --> 3:22:54.780
 Now what will happen?

3:22:54.780 --> 3:22:56.180
 Recreational drugs.

3:22:56.180 --> 3:22:57.020
 People will start saying,

3:22:57.020 --> 3:22:59.700
 well, I want access to recreational drugs.

3:22:59.700 --> 3:23:01.220
 Well, it's gonna be up to,

3:23:01.220 --> 3:23:03.940
 it's gonna accelerate that social discussion

3:23:03.940 --> 3:23:06.340
 that's happening in the US and Canada and UK,

3:23:06.340 --> 3:23:07.180
 everywhere, right?

3:23:07.180 --> 3:23:10.340
 Because cost goes down, access goes up.

3:23:10.340 --> 3:23:13.780
 Giving cannabis THC to some people who've got epilepsy

3:23:13.780 --> 3:23:16.540
 isn't literally, forgive the term, a no brainer

3:23:16.540 --> 3:23:19.660
 because these poor people go from seizures like every day

3:23:19.660 --> 3:23:22.500
 to maybe seizures just once every few months.

3:23:22.500 --> 3:23:25.460
 That's an interesting idea to try to minimize the chance

3:23:25.460 --> 3:23:29.020
 that it can get into like the hands of individuals

3:23:29.020 --> 3:23:32.940
 like terrorists or people that want to do harm.

3:23:32.940 --> 3:23:35.700
 Now with that kind of thing,

3:23:35.700 --> 3:23:39.180
 you're putting a lot of power in the hands of governments,

3:23:39.180 --> 3:23:40.500
 in the hands of institutions.

3:23:40.500 --> 3:23:44.140
 And so then emerge the kind of natural criticism

3:23:44.140 --> 3:23:47.420
 you might have of governments that can sometimes use these

3:23:47.420 --> 3:23:50.940
 for ill, use them as weapons of war,

3:23:50.940 --> 3:23:54.700
 not tools of betterment.

3:23:54.700 --> 3:23:59.580
 So, and sometimes not just war against other nations,

3:23:59.580 --> 3:24:01.540
 but war against its own people

3:24:01.540 --> 3:24:03.460
 as it has been done throughout history.

3:24:04.540 --> 3:24:06.220
 Well, I'm thinking, so there's another way of doing it,

3:24:06.220 --> 3:24:09.260
 a decentralized peer to peer version

3:24:09.260 --> 3:24:11.220
 where, and what you have to do,

3:24:11.220 --> 3:24:13.060
 I'm not saying you should adopt a blockchain,

3:24:13.060 --> 3:24:14.940
 but there is a way of maybe taking Kydeals

3:24:14.940 --> 3:24:16.220
 and put them in blockchain.

3:24:16.220 --> 3:24:17.780
 Here's an idea, let's just say,

3:24:17.780 --> 3:24:18.820
 the way we're doing it in my lab right now

3:24:18.820 --> 3:24:20.420
 is we go to the literature,

3:24:20.420 --> 3:24:23.140
 we take a recipe to make a molecule,

3:24:23.140 --> 3:24:27.180
 convert that to Kydeal and diligently make it in the robot

3:24:27.180 --> 3:24:28.180
 and validate it.

3:24:28.180 --> 3:24:31.740
 We, that, so we, I would call mining proof of work,

3:24:31.740 --> 3:24:34.060
 proof of synthesis, right?

3:24:34.060 --> 3:24:35.060
 Proof of the synthesis.

3:24:35.060 --> 3:24:37.820
 Yeah, yeah, but this is cool because suddenly

3:24:37.820 --> 3:24:38.980
 when you actually synthesize it,

3:24:38.980 --> 3:24:40.180
 you can get the analytical data,

3:24:40.180 --> 3:24:41.540
 but there's also a fingerprint in there

3:24:41.540 --> 3:24:43.660
 of the impurities that get carried across

3:24:43.660 --> 3:24:46.420
 because you can never make one, something 100% pure.

3:24:46.420 --> 3:24:49.700
 That fingerprint will allow you to secure your Kydeal.

3:24:49.700 --> 3:24:51.500
 So what you do is encrypt those two things.

3:24:51.500 --> 3:24:54.140
 So suddenly you can have people out there mining

3:24:54.140 --> 3:24:58.060
 and what you could do perhaps is do the type of thing,

3:24:58.060 --> 3:25:01.660
 we need to basically look at the way that contact tracing

3:25:01.660 --> 3:25:03.220
 should have been done in COVID

3:25:03.220 --> 3:25:05.500
 where people are given the information.

3:25:05.500 --> 3:25:07.940
 So you have just been in contact with someone COVID,

3:25:07.940 --> 3:25:10.540
 you choose, I'm not telling you to stay at home,

3:25:10.540 --> 3:25:12.260
 you choose, right?

3:25:12.260 --> 3:25:14.260
 So now if we could imagine a similar thing,

3:25:14.260 --> 3:25:17.460
 like, you know, you have got access to these chemicals,

3:25:17.460 --> 3:25:18.500
 they will have these effects,

3:25:18.500 --> 3:25:20.940
 you choose and publicize it,

3:25:20.940 --> 3:25:22.660
 or maybe it's out somewhere, I don't know.

3:25:22.660 --> 3:25:25.260
 I'm not a policymaker on this.

3:25:25.260 --> 3:25:26.820
 And what my job here is

3:25:26.820 --> 3:25:29.220
 to not just make the technology possible,

3:25:29.220 --> 3:25:31.940
 but to have as open as a discussion as possible

3:25:31.940 --> 3:25:33.380
 with people to say, hey,

3:25:33.380 --> 3:25:36.900
 can we stop childhood mortality with this technology?

3:25:36.900 --> 3:25:40.300
 And do those benefits outweigh the one off

3:25:40.300 --> 3:25:42.420
 where people might use it for terrorism

3:25:42.420 --> 3:25:45.380
 or people might use it for recreational drugs?

3:25:45.380 --> 3:25:47.340
 Chemify, which is the name of the entity

3:25:47.340 --> 3:25:48.540
 that will make this happen,

3:25:48.540 --> 3:25:51.660
 I think we have some social responsibilities as an entity

3:25:51.660 --> 3:25:53.340
 to make sure that we're not enabling people

3:25:53.340 --> 3:25:56.740
 to manufacture personal drugs, weapons at will.

3:25:56.740 --> 3:25:59.620
 And what we have to do is have a discussion with society,

3:25:59.620 --> 3:26:01.260
 with the people that invest in this,

3:26:01.260 --> 3:26:03.660
 with people that are gonna pay for this,

3:26:03.660 --> 3:26:05.820
 to say, well, do you wanna live longer?

3:26:05.820 --> 3:26:07.500
 And do you wanna be healthier?

3:26:07.500 --> 3:26:09.620
 And are you willing to accept some of the risks?

3:26:09.620 --> 3:26:11.780
 And I think that's a discussion to have.

3:26:11.780 --> 3:26:14.540
 So by the way, when you say personal drugs,

3:26:14.540 --> 3:26:16.220
 do you mean the illegal ones?

3:26:16.220 --> 3:26:19.820
 Or do you have a concern of just putting the manufacturer

3:26:19.820 --> 3:26:22.260
 of any kind of illegal drugs

3:26:22.260 --> 3:26:25.940
 in the hands of regular people?

3:26:25.940 --> 3:26:28.100
 Cause they might, like dose matters.

3:26:28.100 --> 3:26:29.900
 They might take way too much.

3:26:29.900 --> 3:26:31.980
 I mean, I would say, to be honest,

3:26:31.980 --> 3:26:34.060
 the chances of computers being,

3:26:34.060 --> 3:26:35.700
 well, shouldn't always never.

3:26:35.700 --> 3:26:37.540
 So the fact I can now say this means

3:26:37.540 --> 3:26:39.220
 it's totally gonna come true, right?

3:26:39.220 --> 3:26:40.900
 And I'm going to do it.

3:26:40.900 --> 3:26:43.300
 I cannot imagine that computers will be

3:26:43.300 --> 3:26:45.420
 in people's houses anytime soon,

3:26:45.420 --> 3:26:48.540
 but they might be at the local pharmacy, right?

3:26:48.540 --> 3:26:51.140
 And if you've got a drug manufacturing facility

3:26:51.140 --> 3:26:53.580
 in every town, then you just go

3:26:53.580 --> 3:26:54.700
 and they give you a prescription.

3:26:54.700 --> 3:26:56.260
 They do it in such a way, they format it

3:26:56.260 --> 3:26:59.380
 so that you don't have to take 10 pills every day.

3:26:59.380 --> 3:27:01.940
 You get one manufactured for you

3:27:01.940 --> 3:27:03.580
 that has all the materials you need

3:27:03.580 --> 3:27:04.980
 and the right distribution.

3:27:04.980 --> 3:27:05.820
 Got it.

3:27:05.820 --> 3:27:07.300
 But you mentioned recreational drugs.

3:27:07.300 --> 3:27:09.220
 And the reason I mention it,

3:27:09.220 --> 3:27:12.020
 cause I know people are going to speak up on this.

3:27:12.020 --> 3:27:14.820
 If the drug is legal, there's to me,

3:27:14.820 --> 3:27:18.780
 no reason why you can't manufacture it for recreation.

3:27:18.780 --> 3:27:19.620
 I mean, you can do it right now.

3:27:19.620 --> 3:27:21.420
 What do you have against fun, Lee?

3:27:22.580 --> 3:27:26.180
 I have, so I mean, I'm a chemistry professor

3:27:26.180 --> 3:27:29.420
 in a university who's an entrepreneur as well.

3:27:29.420 --> 3:27:31.780
 I just think I need to be as responsible

3:27:31.780 --> 3:27:33.020
 as I can in the discussion.

3:27:33.020 --> 3:27:35.140
 Sure, no, sure, sure.

3:27:35.140 --> 3:27:37.540
 But I know, so let me be the one that says

3:27:37.540 --> 3:27:40.180
 like there's nothing, cause you have said

3:27:40.180 --> 3:27:44.340
 recreational drugs and like terrorism in the same sentence.

3:27:44.340 --> 3:27:47.980
 I think let's make sure we draw a line

3:27:47.980 --> 3:27:50.740
 that there's real dangers to the world

3:27:50.740 --> 3:27:53.380
 of terrorists of bio warfare.

3:27:53.380 --> 3:27:55.820
 And then there's a little bit of weed.

3:27:55.820 --> 3:27:59.980
 So I haven't, I mean, I think it's up to the society

3:27:59.980 --> 3:28:03.020
 to tell his governments what it wants,

3:28:03.020 --> 3:28:04.740
 what's acceptable, right?

3:28:04.740 --> 3:28:07.820
 And if it becomes, let's say that THCs

3:28:07.820 --> 3:28:12.820
 become heavily acceptable and that you can modify them.

3:28:12.860 --> 3:28:15.620
 So let's say there's, let's say it's like blood type.

3:28:15.620 --> 3:28:17.380
 There's a particular type of THC

3:28:17.380 --> 3:28:20.340
 that you tolerate better than I do.

3:28:20.340 --> 3:28:23.540
 Then why not have a machine that makes the one you like?

3:28:23.540 --> 3:28:24.380
 And then, and why not?

3:28:24.380 --> 3:28:26.020
 It's the perfect brownie.

3:28:26.020 --> 3:28:28.700
 Yeah, and I think that that's fine.

3:28:29.620 --> 3:28:32.140
 But I'm, we're so far away from that.

3:28:32.140 --> 3:28:34.500
 I can barely get the thing to work in the lab, right?

3:28:34.500 --> 3:28:36.780
 And I mean, it's reliability and all this other stuff,

3:28:36.780 --> 3:28:39.100
 but what I think is gonna happen in the short term,

3:28:39.100 --> 3:28:43.980
 it's gonna turbocharge molecular discovery reliability

3:28:43.980 --> 3:28:45.500
 and that will change the world.

3:28:45.500 --> 3:28:46.980
 That's super exciting.

3:28:46.980 --> 3:28:49.340
 You have a draft of a paper titled

3:28:49.340 --> 3:28:50.900
 Autonomous Intelligent Exploration,

3:28:50.900 --> 3:28:53.780
 Discovery and Optimization of Nanomaterials.

3:28:53.780 --> 3:28:55.820
 So we are talking about

3:28:55.820 --> 3:28:58.820
 automating engineering of nanomaterials.

3:28:58.820 --> 3:29:01.100
 How hard is this problem?

3:29:01.100 --> 3:29:04.860
 And as we continue down this thread of the positives

3:29:04.860 --> 3:29:06.780
 and the worrisome,

3:29:06.780 --> 3:29:09.660
 what are the things we should be excited about?

3:29:09.660 --> 3:29:12.300
 And what are the things we should be terrified about?

3:29:12.300 --> 3:29:13.940
 And how do we minimize the chance

3:29:13.940 --> 3:29:18.060
 of the terrifying consequences?

3:29:18.060 --> 3:29:21.380
 So in this robot, the robot does all the heavy lifting.

3:29:21.380 --> 3:29:24.460
 So the robot basically is an embodied AI.

3:29:24.460 --> 3:29:29.460
 I really like AI in a domain specific way.

3:29:29.460 --> 3:29:31.460
 One of the, as you should say at this point,

3:29:31.460 --> 3:29:34.260
 there was an attempt in the 60s,

3:29:34.260 --> 3:29:37.300
 Joshua Leidenberg and some really important people

3:29:37.300 --> 3:29:40.180
 did this that made an AI to try and guess

3:29:40.180 --> 3:29:42.260
 if organic molecules and the mass spectrometer

3:29:42.260 --> 3:29:43.700
 were alien or not.

3:29:43.700 --> 3:29:44.740
 Yes.

3:29:44.740 --> 3:29:47.660
 And they failed because they didn't have assembly theory.

3:29:47.660 --> 3:29:48.820
 I see.

3:29:48.820 --> 3:29:49.660
 And when I, and I, and that.

3:29:49.660 --> 3:29:51.380
 Wait, what does assembly theory

3:29:51.380 --> 3:29:53.540
 give you about alien versus human life?

3:29:53.540 --> 3:29:55.660
 Well, no, it just, it tells you about unknown,

3:29:55.660 --> 3:29:56.540
 the degree of unknowns.

3:29:56.540 --> 3:29:57.500
 You can fingerprint stuff.

3:29:57.500 --> 3:29:58.860
 They weren't looking at,

3:29:58.860 --> 3:30:01.260
 they were trying to basically just look at the corpus

3:30:01.260 --> 3:30:04.060
 of complex organic molecules.

3:30:04.060 --> 3:30:06.300
 So when I was a bit down about assembly theory,

3:30:06.300 --> 3:30:08.180
 cause I couldn't convince referees

3:30:08.180 --> 3:30:11.980
 and couldn't convince computational people

3:30:11.980 --> 3:30:14.540
 interested in computational complexity,

3:30:14.540 --> 3:30:16.300
 I was really quite depressed about it.

3:30:16.300 --> 3:30:20.140
 And I mean, I've been working with Sarah Walker's team

3:30:20.140 --> 3:30:21.220
 and I think she, you know,

3:30:21.220 --> 3:30:23.620
 I think she also invented an assembly theory somewhere.

3:30:23.620 --> 3:30:25.180
 We can talk about it later.

3:30:25.180 --> 3:30:30.180
 When I found the AI not working for the dendrial project,

3:30:30.980 --> 3:30:34.700
 I suddenly realized I wasn't totally insane.

3:30:34.700 --> 3:30:37.220
 Coming back to this nano robot.

3:30:37.220 --> 3:30:40.020
 So what it does is it basically, like a computer,

3:30:40.020 --> 3:30:42.980
 but now what it does is it squirts a liquid

3:30:42.980 --> 3:30:45.420
 with gold in it in a test tube

3:30:45.420 --> 3:30:49.660
 and it adds some reducing agents,

3:30:49.660 --> 3:30:51.620
 so some electrons to make the gold

3:30:51.620 --> 3:30:53.260
 turn into a nanoparticle.

3:30:53.260 --> 3:30:54.820
 Now, when gold becomes a nanoparticle,

3:30:54.820 --> 3:30:56.780
 it gets a characteristic color, a plasmon.

3:30:56.780 --> 3:30:58.700
 So it's a bit like if you look at the sheen

3:30:58.700 --> 3:31:01.220
 on the gold wedding ring or gold bar or something,

3:31:01.220 --> 3:31:03.580
 those are the ways that conducting electrons

3:31:03.580 --> 3:31:05.780
 basically reflect light.

3:31:05.780 --> 3:31:08.540
 What we did is we randomly squirt the gold,

3:31:08.540 --> 3:31:10.380
 the gold particle and the reducing agent

3:31:10.380 --> 3:31:13.460
 and then we measure the UV, we measure the color.

3:31:13.460 --> 3:31:16.820
 And so what we do is we've got, the robot has a mind.

3:31:16.820 --> 3:31:20.300
 So it has a mind where in a simulation,

3:31:20.300 --> 3:31:23.820
 it randomly generates nanoparticles and the plasmon,

3:31:23.820 --> 3:31:27.300
 the color that comes out, randomly imagines in its head.

3:31:27.300 --> 3:31:28.340
 It then with the others,

3:31:28.340 --> 3:31:29.820
 that's the imaginary side of the robot.

3:31:29.820 --> 3:31:30.860
 In the physical side of the robot,

3:31:30.860 --> 3:31:34.620
 it squirts in the chemicals and looks at the color

3:31:34.620 --> 3:31:36.380
 and it uses a genetic algorithm

3:31:36.380 --> 3:31:38.660
 and a map elite actually on it.

3:31:38.660 --> 3:31:41.820
 And it goes around in cycles and refines

3:31:43.180 --> 3:31:45.340
 the color to the objective.

3:31:45.340 --> 3:31:46.740
 Now we use two different points.

3:31:46.740 --> 3:31:50.300
 We have an exploration and an optimization.

3:31:50.300 --> 3:31:51.140
 They're two different.

3:31:51.140 --> 3:31:54.420
 So the exploration just says, just do random stuff

3:31:54.420 --> 3:31:55.940
 and see how many different things you can get.

3:31:55.940 --> 3:31:57.460
 And when you get different things,

3:31:57.460 --> 3:32:00.740
 try and optimize and make the peak sharper, sharper, sharper.

3:32:00.740 --> 3:32:03.180
 And what it does after a number of cycles

3:32:03.180 --> 3:32:05.380
 is it physically takes a sample

3:32:05.380 --> 3:32:07.820
 of the optimized nanomaterial,

3:32:07.820 --> 3:32:10.980
 resets all of the round bottom flasks, cleans them

3:32:10.980 --> 3:32:14.620
 and puts the seed, physical seed back in.

3:32:14.620 --> 3:32:16.220
 And then what this robot is able to do

3:32:16.220 --> 3:32:20.580
 is search a space of 10 to the 23 possible reactions

3:32:20.580 --> 3:32:23.020
 in just a thousand experiments in three days.

3:32:24.180 --> 3:32:26.540
 And it makes five generations of nanoparticles

3:32:26.540 --> 3:32:28.580
 which get nicer and nicer in terms of shape

3:32:28.580 --> 3:32:30.140
 and color and definition.

3:32:30.140 --> 3:32:33.100
 And then at the end, it outputs a Kydl code.

3:32:33.100 --> 3:32:34.020
 That could then be.

3:32:34.020 --> 3:32:38.220
 Wow, it's doing the search for programs

3:32:38.220 --> 3:32:39.700
 in the physical space.

3:32:39.700 --> 3:32:42.620
 So it's doing a kind of reinforcement learning.

3:32:42.620 --> 3:32:44.180
 Yeah, yeah, in the physical space.

3:32:44.180 --> 3:32:46.580
 With the exploration and the optimization.

3:32:46.580 --> 3:32:48.740
 And that Kydl will work on any computer

3:32:48.740 --> 3:32:49.580
 or any qualified hardware.

3:32:49.580 --> 3:32:50.940
 So now that's it.

3:32:50.940 --> 3:32:53.220
 That's now that's a general piece of code

3:32:53.220 --> 3:32:57.940
 that can replicate somewhat maybe perfectly

3:32:57.940 --> 3:32:58.980
 what it created.

3:32:58.980 --> 3:32:59.820
 That's amazing.

3:32:59.820 --> 3:33:00.660
 That's incredible.

3:33:00.660 --> 3:33:02.220
 But the nanoparticles themselves are done.

3:33:02.220 --> 3:33:03.580
 The robot has all the thinking.

3:33:03.580 --> 3:33:06.660
 So we don't try and imply any self replication

3:33:06.660 --> 3:33:09.740
 or try and get the particles to make themselves.

3:33:09.740 --> 3:33:11.540
 Although it would be cool to try.

3:33:11.540 --> 3:33:13.060
 So, well, there you go.

3:33:13.060 --> 3:33:14.980
 That's, those are famous last words

3:33:14.980 --> 3:33:16.820
 for the end of human civilization.

3:33:16.820 --> 3:33:17.900
 Would be cool to try.

3:33:17.900 --> 3:33:21.420
 So is it possible to create molecules

3:33:21.420 --> 3:33:24.820
 that start approaching this question

3:33:24.820 --> 3:33:26.580
 that we started this conversation,

3:33:26.580 --> 3:33:29.540
 which is the origin of life.

3:33:29.540 --> 3:33:33.980
 To start to create molecules that have lifelike qualities.

3:33:33.980 --> 3:33:37.740
 So have the replication, have like complex,

3:33:37.740 --> 3:33:40.140
 start to create complex organisms.

3:33:40.140 --> 3:33:42.020
 So we have done this with the oxides.

3:33:42.020 --> 3:33:43.900
 I talked about earlier with the moxides

3:33:43.900 --> 3:33:45.740
 and the rings and the bulls.

3:33:45.740 --> 3:33:48.340
 And the problem is that, well, they do,

3:33:49.300 --> 3:33:52.020
 they auto catalytically enhance one another.

3:33:52.020 --> 3:33:55.780
 So they would, I guess you would call it self replication.

3:33:55.780 --> 3:34:00.780
 But because there's limited function and mutation,

3:34:01.900 --> 3:34:02.740
 they're pretty dumb.

3:34:02.740 --> 3:34:04.540
 So they don't do very much.

3:34:04.540 --> 3:34:09.540
 So I think the prospect of us being able to engineer

3:34:10.340 --> 3:34:13.700
 a nano material life form in the short term,

3:34:13.700 --> 3:34:14.780
 like I said earlier,

3:34:14.780 --> 3:34:16.420
 my aim is to do this, of course.

3:34:16.420 --> 3:34:18.460
 I mean, on one hand, I'm saying it's impossible.

3:34:18.460 --> 3:34:19.540
 On the other hand, I'm saying I'm doing it.

3:34:19.540 --> 3:34:20.380
 So which is it, Lee?

3:34:20.380 --> 3:34:23.700
 It's like, well, I think we can do it,

3:34:23.700 --> 3:34:24.940
 but only in the robot.

3:34:24.940 --> 3:34:27.500
 So the causal chain that's gonna allow it is in the robot.

3:34:27.500 --> 3:34:30.020
 These particles, if they do start to self replicate,

3:34:30.020 --> 3:34:32.300
 the system's gonna be so fragile

3:34:32.300 --> 3:34:35.940
 that I don't think anything dangerous will come out.

3:34:35.940 --> 3:34:38.220
 It doesn't mean we shouldn't treat them

3:34:38.220 --> 3:34:42.260
 as potentially, I mean, I don't want to scare people

3:34:42.260 --> 3:34:43.220
 like gain of function.

3:34:43.220 --> 3:34:45.140
 We're gonna produce stuff that comes out.

3:34:45.140 --> 3:34:48.060
 Our number one kill switch is that we always try

3:34:48.060 --> 3:34:52.460
 to search a space of objects

3:34:52.460 --> 3:34:55.820
 that don't exist in the environment.

3:34:55.820 --> 3:34:58.540
 So even if something got out, it just would die immediately.

3:34:58.540 --> 3:35:01.060
 It's like making a silicon life form or something.

3:35:02.100 --> 3:35:04.340
 Which is the opposite of oftentimes

3:35:04.340 --> 3:35:06.420
 gain of function research is focused on

3:35:06.420 --> 3:35:09.340
 how do you get a dangerous thing

3:35:09.340 --> 3:35:11.700
 to be closer to something that works with humans?

3:35:11.700 --> 3:35:12.540
 Yeah.

3:35:12.540 --> 3:35:13.460
 To have it jump to humans.

3:35:13.460 --> 3:35:16.860
 So that's the one good mode to operate on

3:35:16.860 --> 3:35:21.860
 is always try to operate on chemical entities

3:35:22.100 --> 3:35:25.220
 that are very different than the kind of chemical environment

3:35:25.220 --> 3:35:26.300
 that humans operate in.

3:35:26.300 --> 3:35:29.580
 Yeah, and also, I mean, I'll say something dramatic,

3:35:29.580 --> 3:35:33.260
 which may not be true.

3:35:33.260 --> 3:35:35.140
 So I should be careful.

3:35:35.140 --> 3:35:39.100
 If let's say we did discover a new living system

3:35:39.100 --> 3:35:42.860
 but it was made out of a shadow biosphere

3:35:42.860 --> 3:35:44.540
 and we just released it in the environment,

3:35:44.540 --> 3:35:45.380
 who cares?

3:35:45.380 --> 3:35:46.900
 It's gonna use different stuff.

3:35:48.260 --> 3:35:50.380
 Yeah, it'll just live.

3:35:50.380 --> 3:35:51.620
 Just live, yeah.

3:35:51.620 --> 3:35:53.820
 I found one of my biggest fantasies

3:35:53.820 --> 3:35:55.780
 is actually is like a planet

3:35:55.780 --> 3:35:57.260
 that's basically half in the sun,

3:35:57.260 --> 3:35:59.100
 it doesn't rotate, right?

3:35:59.100 --> 3:36:02.220
 And you have two different origins of life on that planet

3:36:03.300 --> 3:36:05.140
 and they don't share the same chemistry.

3:36:05.140 --> 3:36:05.980
 Yeah.

3:36:05.980 --> 3:36:08.100
 And then the only way time they recognize each other

3:36:08.100 --> 3:36:09.660
 is when they become intelligent, they go,

3:36:09.660 --> 3:36:10.660
 well, what's that moving?

3:36:10.660 --> 3:36:11.500
 Yeah.

3:36:12.460 --> 3:36:14.780
 So they co evolve and that's fascinating.

3:36:14.780 --> 3:36:17.500
 I mean, so one fascinating thing to do

3:36:17.500 --> 3:36:20.820
 is exactly what you were saying, which is a life bomb,

3:36:20.820 --> 3:36:25.820
 which is like try to focus on atmospheres

3:36:25.940 --> 3:36:29.740
 or chemical conditions of other planets

3:36:29.740 --> 3:36:34.740
 and try within this kind of exploration optimization system

3:36:34.740 --> 3:36:39.740
 try to discover life forms that can work in those conditions

3:36:40.380 --> 3:36:43.060
 and then you send those life forms over there

3:36:43.060 --> 3:36:44.860
 and see what kind of stuff they build up.

3:36:44.860 --> 3:36:47.260
 Like you can do like a large scale,

3:36:47.260 --> 3:36:50.300
 it's kind of a safe physical environment

3:36:50.300 --> 3:36:53.180
 to do large scale experiments, it's another planet.

3:36:53.180 --> 3:36:55.780
 Yeah, so look, I'm gonna say something quite contentious.

3:36:55.780 --> 3:36:57.580
 I mean, Elon wants to go to Mars,

3:36:57.580 --> 3:36:59.020
 I think it's brilliant wants to go to Mars,

3:36:59.020 --> 3:37:01.060
 but I would counter that and say,

3:37:01.060 --> 3:37:03.620
 is Elon just obsessed with getting humanity?

3:37:03.620 --> 3:37:06.740
 Or Earth, or what about just technology?

3:37:06.740 --> 3:37:09.500
 So if we do technology, so Elon either needs

3:37:09.500 --> 3:37:10.540
 to take a computer to Mars

3:37:10.540 --> 3:37:12.860
 because he needs to manufacture drugs on demand,

3:37:12.860 --> 3:37:16.140
 because zero cost payload and all that stuff is just code.

3:37:16.140 --> 3:37:18.860
 Or what we do is we actually say, hang on,

3:37:18.860 --> 3:37:21.220
 it's quite hard for humans to survive on Mars.

3:37:21.220 --> 3:37:24.180
 Why don't we write a series of origin of life algorithms

3:37:24.180 --> 3:37:26.220
 where we embed our culture in it?

3:37:26.220 --> 3:37:28.860
 It's a very Ridley spot Prometheus,

3:37:28.860 --> 3:37:31.380
 which is a terrible film by the way, but anyway.

3:37:31.380 --> 3:37:36.380
 And dump it on Mars and just terraform Mars.

3:37:37.300 --> 3:37:39.660
 And what we do is we evolve life on Mars

3:37:39.660 --> 3:37:42.180
 that is suited to life on Mars,

3:37:42.180 --> 3:37:44.660
 rather than brute forcing human life on Mars.

3:37:44.660 --> 3:37:48.580
 So one of the questions is, what is human culture?

3:37:48.580 --> 3:37:50.180
 What are the things you encode?

3:37:50.180 --> 3:37:52.660
 Some of it is knowledge, some of it is information.

3:37:52.660 --> 3:37:55.220
 But the thing that Elon talks about,

3:37:55.220 --> 3:37:58.700
 the thing I think about, I think you think about as well

3:37:58.700 --> 3:38:03.700
 is some of the more unique aspects of what makes us human,

3:38:06.460 --> 3:38:09.820
 which is our particular kind of consciousness.

3:38:09.820 --> 3:38:13.260
 So he talks about the flame of human consciousness.

3:38:13.260 --> 3:38:15.180
 That's one of the questions is,

3:38:15.180 --> 3:38:20.180
 can we instill consciousness into other beings?

3:38:22.180 --> 3:38:26.940
 Because that's a sad thought that whatever this thing

3:38:26.940 --> 3:38:30.100
 inside our minds, that hopes and dreams and fears

3:38:30.100 --> 3:38:33.060
 and loves can all die.

3:38:33.940 --> 3:38:35.300
 Yeah, but I think you already know

3:38:35.300 --> 3:38:37.540
 the answer to that question.

3:38:37.540 --> 3:38:40.180
 I have a robot lawnmower at home.

3:38:40.180 --> 3:38:42.380
 My kids call it CC, cool car.

3:38:42.380 --> 3:38:44.740
 It's a robo mower.

3:38:44.740 --> 3:38:47.060
 And the way it works, it has an electric field

3:38:47.060 --> 3:38:49.940
 around the perimeter and it just tell it the area.

3:38:49.940 --> 3:38:52.860
 And it goes out and goes from its base station,

3:38:52.860 --> 3:38:54.220
 just mows a bit.

3:38:54.220 --> 3:38:55.980
 Gets to the perimeter, detects perimeter,

3:38:55.980 --> 3:38:58.900
 then chooses a random angle, rotates around and goes on.

3:38:58.900 --> 3:39:00.420
 Yeah.

3:39:00.420 --> 3:39:02.020
 My kids call it cool cutter.

3:39:02.020 --> 3:39:02.860
 It's a she.

3:39:02.860 --> 3:39:03.820
 I don't know why it's a she.

3:39:03.820 --> 3:39:05.420
 They just, when they were like quite young,

3:39:05.420 --> 3:39:08.420
 they called it, I don't want to be sexist there.

3:39:08.420 --> 3:39:10.020
 It could be a he, but they liked.

3:39:11.860 --> 3:39:13.180
 They gendered the lawnmower?

3:39:13.180 --> 3:39:14.140
 They gendered the lawnmower.

3:39:14.140 --> 3:39:14.980
 Okay.

3:39:14.980 --> 3:39:15.820
 Yeah, why not?

3:39:15.820 --> 3:39:17.820
 But I was thinking this lawnmower,

3:39:17.820 --> 3:39:20.540
 if you apply integrated information theory to lawnmower,

3:39:20.540 --> 3:39:22.660
 the lawnmower is conscious.

3:39:22.660 --> 3:39:26.420
 Now, integrated information theory is,

3:39:26.420 --> 3:39:28.220
 people say it's a flawed way of measuring consciousness,

3:39:28.220 --> 3:39:29.060
 but I don't think it is.

3:39:29.060 --> 3:39:32.060
 I think assembly theory actually measures consciousness

3:39:32.060 --> 3:39:33.220
 in the same way.

3:39:33.220 --> 3:39:35.900
 Consciousness is something that is generated

3:39:35.900 --> 3:39:38.820
 over a population of objects, of humans.

3:39:38.820 --> 3:39:40.980
 Consciousness didn't suddenly spring in.

3:39:40.980 --> 3:39:43.180
 Our consciousness has evolved together, right?

3:39:43.180 --> 3:39:45.980
 The fact we're here and the robots we leave behind,

3:39:45.980 --> 3:39:47.180
 they will have some of that.

3:39:47.180 --> 3:39:49.100
 So we won't lose it all.

3:39:49.100 --> 3:39:50.900
 Sure, consciousness requires

3:39:50.900 --> 3:39:52.860
 that we have many models being generated.

3:39:52.860 --> 3:39:55.180
 It's not just one domain specific AI, right?

3:39:55.180 --> 3:39:57.420
 I think the way to create consciousness,

3:39:57.420 --> 3:39:58.660
 I'm going to say unashamedly,

3:39:58.660 --> 3:40:02.820
 the best way to make a consciousness is in a chemical system

3:40:02.820 --> 3:40:05.300
 because you just have access to many more states.

3:40:05.300 --> 3:40:06.260
 And the problem right now,

3:40:06.260 --> 3:40:08.580
 we're making silicon consciousness

3:40:08.580 --> 3:40:10.860
 because you just don't have enough states.

3:40:10.860 --> 3:40:12.740
 So there are more possible states,

3:40:12.740 --> 3:40:14.980
 or sorry, there are more possible configurations possible

3:40:14.980 --> 3:40:17.940
 in your brain than there are atoms in the universe.

3:40:17.940 --> 3:40:20.500
 And you can switch between them.

3:40:20.500 --> 3:40:22.780
 You can't do that on a core I10.

3:40:22.780 --> 3:40:25.300
 It's got 10 billion, 12 billion, 14 billion transistors,

3:40:25.300 --> 3:40:28.340
 but you can't reconfigure them as dynamically.

3:40:28.340 --> 3:40:31.420
 Well, you've shared this intuition a few times already

3:40:31.420 --> 3:40:34.660
 that the larger number of states

3:40:34.660 --> 3:40:38.420
 somehow correlates to greater possibility of life,

3:40:38.420 --> 3:40:42.380
 but it's also possible the constraints are essential here.

3:40:42.380 --> 3:40:43.420
 Yeah, yeah.

3:40:43.420 --> 3:40:45.620
 I mean, but coming back to the,

3:40:45.620 --> 3:40:46.820
 you worry that something's lost.

3:40:46.820 --> 3:40:51.820
 I agree, but I think that we will get to an AGI,

3:40:53.780 --> 3:40:56.220
 but I wonder if it's not,

3:40:56.220 --> 3:40:58.300
 it can't be separate from human,

3:40:58.300 --> 3:41:00.100
 it can't be separate from human consciousness

3:41:00.100 --> 3:41:03.060
 because the causal chain that produced it came from humans.

3:41:03.060 --> 3:41:06.380
 So what I kind of try and suggest heavily

3:41:06.380 --> 3:41:11.380
 to people worry about the existential threat of AI saying,

3:41:11.540 --> 3:41:13.460
 I mean, you put it much more elegantly earlier,

3:41:13.460 --> 3:41:16.820
 like we should worry about algorithms on, dumb algorithms

3:41:16.820 --> 3:41:21.140
 written by human beings on Twitter driving us insane, right?

3:41:21.140 --> 3:41:23.260
 And doing acting in odd ways.

3:41:23.260 --> 3:41:24.940
 Yeah, I think intelligence,

3:41:24.940 --> 3:41:27.100
 this is what I have been in eloquent

3:41:27.100 --> 3:41:30.620
 in trying to describe it partially

3:41:30.620 --> 3:41:34.940
 because I try not to think too deeply through this stuff

3:41:34.940 --> 3:41:36.260
 because then you become a philosopher.

3:41:36.260 --> 3:41:40.460
 I still aspire to actually building a bunch of stuff.

3:41:40.460 --> 3:41:44.580
 But my sense is super intelligence leads

3:41:44.580 --> 3:41:48.780
 to deep integration to human society.

3:41:48.780 --> 3:41:51.980
 So like intelligence is strongly correlated.

3:41:51.980 --> 3:41:56.980
 Like intelligence, the way we conceive of intelligence

3:41:56.980 --> 3:42:01.980
 materializes as a thing that becomes a fun entity

3:42:03.300 --> 3:42:06.420
 to have at a party and with humans.

3:42:06.420 --> 3:42:09.980
 So like it's a mix of wit, intelligence, humor,

3:42:09.980 --> 3:42:11.740
 like intelligence, like knowledge,

3:42:11.740 --> 3:42:14.340
 ability to do reasoning and so on,

3:42:14.340 --> 3:42:17.980
 but also humor, emotional intelligence,

3:42:17.980 --> 3:42:22.980
 ability to love, to dream, to share those dreams,

3:42:23.460 --> 3:42:28.060
 to play the game of human civilization,

3:42:28.060 --> 3:42:30.100
 the push and pull, the whole dance of it,

3:42:30.100 --> 3:42:31.380
 the whole dance of life.

3:42:31.380 --> 3:42:35.420
 And I think that kind of super intelligent being

3:42:35.420 --> 3:42:38.140
 is not the thing that worries me.

3:42:38.140 --> 3:42:41.140
 I think that ultimately will enrich life.

3:42:41.140 --> 3:42:43.060
 It's again, the dumb algorithms,

3:42:43.060 --> 3:42:46.620
 the dumb algorithms that scale in the hands of people

3:42:46.620 --> 3:42:48.860
 that are too, don't study history,

3:42:48.860 --> 3:42:51.820
 that don't study human psychology and human nature,

3:42:51.820 --> 3:42:56.820
 just applying too broadly for selfish near term interests.

3:42:57.020 --> 3:42:58.500
 That's the biggest danger.

3:42:58.500 --> 3:43:01.420
 Yeah, I think it's not a new danger, right?

3:43:01.420 --> 3:43:04.660
 I now know how I should use Twitter

3:43:04.660 --> 3:43:07.500
 and how I shouldn't use Twitter, right?

3:43:07.500 --> 3:43:09.620
 I like to provoke people into thinking.

3:43:09.620 --> 3:43:11.580
 I don't want to provoke people into outrage.

3:43:11.580 --> 3:43:12.420
 It's not fun.

3:43:12.420 --> 3:43:14.620
 It's not a good thing for humans to do, right?

3:43:14.620 --> 3:43:16.740
 And I think that when you get people into outrage,

3:43:16.740 --> 3:43:20.060
 they take sides and taking sides is really bad.

3:43:20.060 --> 3:43:22.100
 But I think that we're all beginning to see this.

3:43:22.100 --> 3:43:24.820
 And I think that actually I'm very optimistic

3:43:24.820 --> 3:43:28.580
 about how things will evolve because, you know,

3:43:28.580 --> 3:43:32.020
 I wonder how much productivity has Twitter

3:43:32.020 --> 3:43:33.820
 and social media taken out of humanity?

3:43:33.820 --> 3:43:36.620
 Because how many now, I mean,

3:43:36.620 --> 3:43:38.980
 so the good thing about Twitter is it gives power,

3:43:38.980 --> 3:43:41.300
 so it gives voice to minorities, right?

3:43:41.300 --> 3:43:44.220
 And that's good to some degree.

3:43:44.220 --> 3:43:47.460
 But I wonder how much voice does it give

3:43:47.460 --> 3:43:52.460
 to all sorts of other problems

3:43:52.460 --> 3:43:54.300
 that don't need this emerge?

3:43:54.300 --> 3:43:55.820
 By the way, when you say minorities,

3:43:55.820 --> 3:44:00.020
 I think, or at least if I were to agree with you,

3:44:00.020 --> 3:44:02.380
 what I would say is minorities broadly defined

3:44:02.380 --> 3:44:07.380
 in these small groups of people that it magnifies

3:44:09.580 --> 3:44:12.900
 the concerns of the small versus the big.

3:44:12.900 --> 3:44:14.620
 That is good to some degree.

3:44:15.660 --> 3:44:17.980
 But I think, I mean, I have to be careful

3:44:17.980 --> 3:44:20.940
 because I think I have a very,

3:44:20.940 --> 3:44:23.420
 I mean, I think that the world isn't that broken, right?

3:44:23.420 --> 3:44:25.100
 I think the world is pretty cool place.

3:44:25.100 --> 3:44:26.980
 I think academia is really great.

3:44:26.980 --> 3:44:29.980
 I think climate change presents

3:44:29.980 --> 3:44:32.380
 a really interesting problem for humanity

3:44:32.380 --> 3:44:33.500
 that we will solve.

3:44:33.500 --> 3:44:34.340
 I like how you said it.

3:44:34.340 --> 3:44:37.540
 It's a pretty cool problem for civilization.

3:44:37.540 --> 3:44:38.460
 It's a big one.

3:44:38.460 --> 3:44:39.300
 Well, it's a bunch of it.

3:44:39.300 --> 3:44:42.620
 There's a bunch of really, really big problems

3:44:42.620 --> 3:44:45.940
 that if solved can significantly improve

3:44:45.940 --> 3:44:47.540
 the quality of life or learn.

3:44:47.540 --> 3:44:49.580
 That ultimately is what we're trying to do,

3:44:49.580 --> 3:44:51.700
 improve how awesome life is

3:44:51.700 --> 3:44:53.420
 for the maximum number of people.

3:44:53.420 --> 3:44:56.620
 Yeah, and I think that the coming back to consciousness,

3:44:56.620 --> 3:45:00.300
 I don't think the universe is doomed to heat death, right?

3:45:00.300 --> 3:45:01.460
 It's one of the optimists.

3:45:01.460 --> 3:45:03.300
 That's why I want to kind of nudge you

3:45:03.300 --> 3:45:04.740
 into thinking that time is fundamental

3:45:04.740 --> 3:45:05.860
 because if time is fundamental,

3:45:05.860 --> 3:45:09.180
 then suddenly you don't have to give it back.

3:45:09.180 --> 3:45:11.460
 The universe just constructs stuff.

3:45:11.460 --> 3:45:13.260
 And what we see around us in our construction,

3:45:13.260 --> 3:45:16.060
 I know everyone's worried about how fragile civilization is.

3:45:16.060 --> 3:45:17.740
 And I mean, look at the fundamentals.

3:45:17.740 --> 3:45:22.020
 We're good until the sun expands, right?

3:45:22.020 --> 3:45:23.780
 We've got quite a lot of resource on earth.

3:45:23.780 --> 3:45:25.700
 We're trying to be quite cooperative.

3:45:25.700 --> 3:45:27.780
 Humans are nice to each other

3:45:27.780 --> 3:45:31.860
 when they're not under enormous stress.

3:45:31.860 --> 3:45:33.780
 But coming back to the consciousness thing,

3:45:33.780 --> 3:45:36.620
 are we going to send human beings to Mars

3:45:36.620 --> 3:45:38.420
 or conscious robots to Mars?

3:45:38.420 --> 3:45:40.460
 Or are we gonna send some hybrid?

3:45:40.460 --> 3:45:43.340
 And I don't know the answer to that question right now.

3:45:43.340 --> 3:45:44.660
 I guess, you know,

3:45:44.660 --> 3:45:46.500
 Elon is gonna have a pretty good go at getting there.

3:45:46.500 --> 3:45:47.620
 I'm not sure whether,

3:45:49.740 --> 3:45:52.980
 I have my doubts, but I'm not qualified.

3:45:52.980 --> 3:45:56.700
 I'm sure people have their doubts that computation works,

3:45:56.700 --> 3:45:58.260
 but I've got it working.

3:45:58.260 --> 3:45:59.300
 And I, you know.

3:45:59.300 --> 3:46:02.740
 And most of the cool technologies we have today

3:46:03.660 --> 3:46:05.740
 and take for granted,

3:46:05.740 --> 3:46:08.540
 like the airplane, a aforementioned airplane,

3:46:08.540 --> 3:46:11.260
 were things that people doubted.

3:46:11.260 --> 3:46:13.060
 Like majority of people doubted

3:46:13.060 --> 3:46:16.100
 before they came to life and they come to life.

3:46:16.100 --> 3:46:19.140
 And speaking of hybrid AI and humans,

3:46:19.140 --> 3:46:21.500
 it's fascinating to think about all the different ways

3:46:21.500 --> 3:46:25.060
 that hybridization, that merger can happen.

3:46:25.060 --> 3:46:27.300
 I mean, we have, currently have the smartphone,

3:46:27.300 --> 3:46:28.500
 so there's already a hybrid,

3:46:28.500 --> 3:46:31.420
 but there's all kinds of ways that hybrid happens.

3:46:31.420 --> 3:46:34.380
 How we and other technology play together,

3:46:34.380 --> 3:46:37.460
 like a computer, how that changes

3:46:37.460 --> 3:46:40.740
 the fabric of human civilization is like wide open.

3:46:40.740 --> 3:46:41.620
 Who knows?

3:46:41.620 --> 3:46:42.540
 Who knows?

3:46:42.540 --> 3:46:43.780
 If you remove,

3:46:46.060 --> 3:46:47.740
 if you remove cancer,

3:46:47.740 --> 3:46:52.460
 if you remove major diseases from humanity,

3:46:53.980 --> 3:46:55.620
 there's going to be a bunch of consequences

3:46:55.620 --> 3:46:57.140
 we're not anticipating.

3:46:57.140 --> 3:47:01.100
 Many of them positive, but many of them negative.

3:47:01.100 --> 3:47:04.100
 Many of them, most of them, at least I hope,

3:47:04.100 --> 3:47:06.580
 are weird and wonderful and fun

3:47:06.580 --> 3:47:08.740
 in ways that are totally unexpected.

3:47:08.740 --> 3:47:11.780
 And we sitting on a porch with a bottle of Jack Daniels

3:47:11.780 --> 3:47:13.620
 and a rocker will say,

3:47:13.620 --> 3:47:15.220
 kids these days don't appreciate

3:47:15.220 --> 3:47:17.180
 how hard we had it back in the day.

3:47:17.180 --> 3:47:21.260
 I gotta ask you, speaking of nudging,

3:47:21.260 --> 3:47:25.860
 you and Joscha Bach nudge each other on Twitter quite a bit

3:47:25.860 --> 3:47:29.380
 in wonderful intellectual debates.

3:47:29.380 --> 3:47:31.340
 And of course, for people who don't know Joscha Bach,

3:47:31.340 --> 3:47:32.300
 he's this brilliant guy.

3:47:32.300 --> 3:47:34.300
 He's been on the podcast a couple times.

3:47:35.260 --> 3:47:38.780
 You tweeted, or he tweeted,

3:47:38.780 --> 3:47:41.100
 Joscha Bach, everyone should follow him as well.

3:47:41.100 --> 3:47:44.420
 You should definitely follow Mr. Lee Cronin, Dr. Lee Cronin.

3:47:44.420 --> 3:47:48.140
 He tweeted, dinner with Lee Cronin.

3:47:48.140 --> 3:47:50.860
 We discussed that while we can translate

3:47:50.860 --> 3:47:54.420
 every working model of existence into a Turing machine,

3:47:54.420 --> 3:47:56.780
 the structure of the universe might be given

3:47:56.780 --> 3:47:59.660
 by weeks of nonexistence in a pattern generated

3:47:59.660 --> 3:48:04.220
 by all possible automata, which exist by default.

3:48:05.780 --> 3:48:09.900
 And then he followed on saying face to face is the best.

3:48:09.900 --> 3:48:12.140
 So the dinner was face to face.

3:48:12.140 --> 3:48:16.460
 What is Joscha talking about in weeks, quote,

3:48:16.460 --> 3:48:19.820
 weeks of nonexistence in a pattern generated

3:48:19.820 --> 3:48:24.820
 by all possible automata, which exist by default.

3:48:25.460 --> 3:48:29.820
 So automata exist by default, apparently.

3:48:29.820 --> 3:48:31.740
 And then there's weeks of nonexistence.

3:48:31.740 --> 3:48:34.900
 What the hell is nonexistence in the universe?

3:48:34.900 --> 3:48:39.340
 That's, and also in another conversation,

3:48:39.340 --> 3:48:44.340
 you tweeted it's state machines all the way down,

3:48:44.460 --> 3:48:47.820
 which presumably is the origin story of this discussion.

3:48:47.820 --> 3:48:52.820
 And then Joscha said, again, nudging, nudging,

3:48:53.220 --> 3:48:56.460
 nudging slash trolling, Joscha said,

3:48:56.460 --> 3:48:59.260
 you've seen the light, welcome friend.

3:48:59.260 --> 3:49:01.660
 Many foundational physicists effectively believe

3:49:01.660 --> 3:49:04.420
 in some form of hyper computation.

3:49:04.420 --> 3:49:07.060
 Lee is coming around to this idea.

3:49:07.060 --> 3:49:10.220
 And then you said, I think there are notable differences.

3:49:10.220 --> 3:49:13.100
 First, I think the universe does not have to be a computer.

3:49:13.100 --> 3:49:16.820
 Second, I want to understand how the universe emerges,

3:49:16.820 --> 3:49:18.460
 constructors that build computers.

3:49:18.460 --> 3:49:23.460
 And third is that there is something below church touring.

3:49:24.980 --> 3:49:29.980
 Okay, what the heck is this dinner conversation about?

3:49:30.780 --> 3:49:34.700
 Maybe put another way, maybe zooming out a little bit.

3:49:34.700 --> 3:49:37.020
 Are there interesting agreements or disagreements

3:49:37.020 --> 3:49:41.540
 between you and Joscha Bach that can elucidate

3:49:41.540 --> 3:49:44.060
 some of the other topics we've been talking about?

3:49:44.060 --> 3:49:46.100
 Yeah, so Jascha has an incredible mind

3:49:46.100 --> 3:49:48.700
 and he has, he's so well read

3:49:49.940 --> 3:49:53.300
 and uses language really elegantly.

3:49:53.300 --> 3:49:54.820
 It bamboozles me at times.

3:49:54.820 --> 3:49:59.340
 So I'm, so often I'm using, I'm describing concepts

3:49:59.340 --> 3:50:03.140
 in a way that I built from the ground up.

3:50:03.140 --> 3:50:05.300
 And so we misunderstand each other a lot.

3:50:05.300 --> 3:50:08.180
 And he's floating in the clouds, is that what you're saying?

3:50:08.180 --> 3:50:09.780
 Something like, not quite, but I think,

3:50:09.780 --> 3:50:11.620
 so this concept of a Turing machine.

3:50:11.620 --> 3:50:15.420
 So a Turing machine, Turing machines, I would argue,

3:50:15.420 --> 3:50:18.500
 and I think this is not, the Turing machine,

3:50:18.500 --> 3:50:21.020
 the universe is not a Turing machine.

3:50:21.020 --> 3:50:23.220
 Biology is not even a Turing machine, right?

3:50:23.220 --> 3:50:25.620
 And because Turing machines don't evolve, right?

3:50:25.620 --> 3:50:27.020
 There is this problem

3:50:27.020 --> 3:50:28.620
 that people see Turing machines everywhere,

3:50:28.620 --> 3:50:31.580
 but isn't it interesting the universe gave rise to biology

3:50:31.580 --> 3:50:32.820
 that gave rise to intelligence,

3:50:32.820 --> 3:50:34.420
 that gave rise to Alan Turing,

3:50:34.420 --> 3:50:37.060
 who invented the abstraction of the Turing machine

3:50:37.060 --> 3:50:39.580
 and allowed us to digitize.

3:50:39.580 --> 3:50:43.340
 And so I've been looking for the mystery

3:50:43.340 --> 3:50:45.500
 at the origin of life, the origin of intelligence

3:50:45.500 --> 3:50:46.420
 and the origin of this.

3:50:46.420 --> 3:50:48.340
 And I, when I discussed with Yasha,

3:50:48.340 --> 3:50:51.300
 I think Yasha, he was saying, well, the universe,

3:50:51.300 --> 3:50:53.300
 of course the universe is a Turing machine.

3:50:53.300 --> 3:50:56.260
 Of course there's a hyper computer there.

3:50:56.260 --> 3:50:59.860
 And I think we got kind of trapped in our words and terms

3:50:59.860 --> 3:51:02.220
 because of course it's possible for a Turing machine

3:51:02.220 --> 3:51:04.180
 or computers to exist in the universe.

3:51:04.180 --> 3:51:05.460
 We have them.

3:51:05.460 --> 3:51:07.740
 But what I'm trying to understand is

3:51:07.740 --> 3:51:11.340
 where did the transition of continuous discrete occur?

3:51:11.340 --> 3:51:14.900
 And I've been, and this is because of my general foolishness

3:51:14.900 --> 3:51:19.500
 of understanding the continuous.

3:51:19.500 --> 3:51:23.540
 But I guess what I'm trying to say is

3:51:23.540 --> 3:51:26.740
 there were constructors before there were abstractors

3:51:26.740 --> 3:51:31.500
 because how did the universe abstract itself into existence?

3:51:31.500 --> 3:51:32.780
 And it goes back to earlier saying,

3:51:32.780 --> 3:51:35.220
 could the universe of intelligence have come first?

3:51:35.220 --> 3:51:37.260
 What's a constructor, what's an abstractor?

3:51:37.260 --> 3:51:40.580
 So the abstractor is the ability of say,

3:51:40.580 --> 3:51:45.100
 of Alan Turing and Gödel and Church

3:51:45.100 --> 3:51:50.100
 to think about the mathematical universe and to label things.

3:51:50.740 --> 3:51:54.460
 And then from those labels to come up with a set of axioms

3:51:54.460 --> 3:51:57.620
 with those labels and to basically understand

3:51:57.620 --> 3:51:59.580
 the universe mathematically and say, okay,

3:51:59.580 --> 3:52:01.180
 I can label things.

3:52:01.180 --> 3:52:03.140
 Where did the labeler come from?

3:52:03.140 --> 3:52:04.700
 Where is the prime labeler?

3:52:04.700 --> 3:52:09.700
 Even if the universe is not a Turing computer,

3:52:12.060 --> 3:52:14.060
 does that negate the possibility

3:52:14.060 --> 3:52:16.740
 that a Turing computer can simulate the universe?

3:52:16.740 --> 3:52:19.900
 Just because the abstraction was formed at a later time,

3:52:20.980 --> 3:52:22.660
 does that mean that abstraction,

3:52:22.660 --> 3:52:25.260
 this is to our cellular automata conversation.

3:52:25.260 --> 3:52:26.660
 You were taking away some of the magic

3:52:26.660 --> 3:52:29.380
 from the cellular automata because very intelligent

3:52:29.380 --> 3:52:32.380
 biological systems came up with that cellular automata.

3:52:32.380 --> 3:52:34.380
 Well, this is where the existence is the default, right?

3:52:34.380 --> 3:52:36.260
 Is it, does the fact that we exist

3:52:36.260 --> 3:52:38.100
 and we can come up with a Turing machine,

3:52:38.100 --> 3:52:40.100
 does that mean the universe has to be

3:52:40.100 --> 3:52:41.980
 a Turing machine as well?

3:52:41.980 --> 3:52:44.020
 But can it be a Turing machine though?

3:52:44.020 --> 3:52:46.900
 That's a, so the has to be and the can it be.

3:52:46.900 --> 3:52:47.860
 Can it be?

3:52:47.860 --> 3:52:48.740
 Sure.

3:52:50.300 --> 3:52:52.460
 I don't know, I don't understand

3:52:52.460 --> 3:52:54.780
 if it has to be or not, can it be?

3:52:54.780 --> 3:52:57.980
 But can the universe have Turing machines in it?

3:52:57.980 --> 3:53:00.060
 Sure, they exist now.

3:53:01.020 --> 3:53:04.340
 I'm wondering though, maybe,

3:53:04.340 --> 3:53:07.460
 and this is where things get really hairy,

3:53:07.460 --> 3:53:09.420
 is I think the universe maybe in the past

3:53:09.420 --> 3:53:13.540
 did not have the computational power that it has now.

3:53:17.900 --> 3:53:21.540
 This is almost like a law of physics kind of,

3:53:21.540 --> 3:53:24.300
 so the computational power is not,

3:53:24.300 --> 3:53:28.660
 you can get some free lunch.

3:53:28.660 --> 3:53:30.620
 Yeah, I mean, the fact that we now,

3:53:30.620 --> 3:53:32.300
 we sit here in this period in time

3:53:32.300 --> 3:53:33.940
 and we can imagine all these robots

3:53:33.940 --> 3:53:36.020
 and all these machines and we built them.

3:53:36.020 --> 3:53:38.260
 And so we can easily imagine going back in time

3:53:38.260 --> 3:53:39.740
 that the universe was capable of having them,

3:53:39.740 --> 3:53:41.900
 but I don't think it can.

3:53:41.900 --> 3:53:45.220
 So the universe may have been a lot dumber computationally.

3:53:45.220 --> 3:53:46.780
 And I think that's why,

3:53:46.780 --> 3:53:48.500
 I don't want to go back to the time discussion,

3:53:48.500 --> 3:53:50.740
 but I think it has some relationship with it.

3:53:50.740 --> 3:53:53.420
 The universe is basically smarter now than it used to be

3:53:53.420 --> 3:53:57.020
 and it's going to continue getting smarter over time

3:53:57.020 --> 3:53:59.380
 because of novelty, generation,

3:53:59.380 --> 3:54:00.940
 and the ability to create objects

3:54:00.940 --> 3:54:02.420
 within objects within objects.

3:54:02.420 --> 3:54:05.220
 You know, there's a, perhaps it's grounded in physics,

3:54:05.220 --> 3:54:07.900
 there's this intuition of conservation.

3:54:07.900 --> 3:54:09.180
 Yeah. That stuff is conserved.

3:54:09.180 --> 3:54:12.420
 Like you're not, you've always had all,

3:54:12.420 --> 3:54:15.220
 everything, you're just rearranging books

3:54:15.220 --> 3:54:18.500
 on the bookshelf through time.

3:54:18.500 --> 3:54:19.940
 So, okay. But you're saying like

3:54:19.940 --> 3:54:21.660
 new books are being written.

3:54:21.660 --> 3:54:22.980
 Which laws do you want to break?

3:54:22.980 --> 3:54:25.900
 At the origin of the big bang,

3:54:25.900 --> 3:54:27.340
 you had to break the second law

3:54:27.340 --> 3:54:28.500
 because we got order for free.

3:54:28.500 --> 3:54:29.540
 Yeah.

3:54:29.540 --> 3:54:30.380
 Well, what I'm telling you now

3:54:30.380 --> 3:54:33.420
 is that the energy isn't conserved in the universe.

3:54:33.420 --> 3:54:35.460
 Oh, it's the second law. Okay. I got you.

3:54:35.460 --> 3:54:38.020
 So because, but not in a mad way.

3:54:38.020 --> 3:54:43.020
 Okay. So computation potentially is not conserved,

3:54:44.660 --> 3:54:46.460
 which is a fascinating idea.

3:54:46.460 --> 3:54:49.220
 Intelligence is not conserved.

3:54:49.220 --> 3:54:52.540
 Complexity is not conserved.

3:54:54.660 --> 3:54:57.420
 I suppose that's deeply connected

3:54:57.420 --> 3:55:00.340
 to time being fundamental.

3:55:01.180 --> 3:55:03.180
 The natural consequence of that

3:55:03.180 --> 3:55:05.300
 is if time is fundamental

3:55:05.300 --> 3:55:09.660
 and the universe is inflating in time, if you like,

3:55:09.660 --> 3:55:11.860
 then there are one or two conservation laws

3:55:11.860 --> 3:55:14.060
 that we need to have a look at.

3:55:14.060 --> 3:55:16.220
 And I wonder if that means the total energy

3:55:16.220 --> 3:55:18.980
 of the universe is actually increasing over time.

3:55:18.980 --> 3:55:21.100
 And this may be completely ludicrous,

3:55:21.100 --> 3:55:25.260
 but we do have all this dark energy.

3:55:25.260 --> 3:55:28.060
 We have some anomalies, let's say,

3:55:28.060 --> 3:55:29.380
 dark matter and dark energy.

3:55:29.380 --> 3:55:30.980
 If we don't add them in,

3:55:30.980 --> 3:55:35.420
 galaxies, so dark matter, I think doesn't hold.

3:55:35.420 --> 3:55:36.980
 You need to hold the galaxies together

3:55:36.980 --> 3:55:38.900
 and there's some other observational issues.

3:55:38.900 --> 3:55:40.620
 Could dark energy just be time?

3:55:42.140 --> 3:55:44.500
 So figuring out what dark energy is

3:55:44.500 --> 3:55:47.180
 might give us some deep clues

3:55:47.180 --> 3:55:52.180
 about this, not just time, but the consequences of time.

3:55:53.140 --> 3:55:55.300
 So it could be that, I mean,

3:55:55.300 --> 3:55:57.220
 I'm not saying there's perpetual motions allowed

3:55:57.220 --> 3:55:59.100
 and it's free lunch, but I'm saying

3:55:59.100 --> 3:56:02.860
 if the universe is intrinsically asymmetric

3:56:02.860 --> 3:56:07.580
 and it appears to be, and it's generating novelty

3:56:07.580 --> 3:56:11.380
 and it appears to, couldn't that just be mechanistically

3:56:11.380 --> 3:56:13.500
 how reality works?

3:56:13.500 --> 3:56:18.500
 And therefore I don't really like this idea that the,

3:56:18.700 --> 3:56:21.940
 so I want to live in a deterministic universe

3:56:21.940 --> 3:56:25.180
 that is undetermined, right?

3:56:25.180 --> 3:56:27.580
 The only way I can do that is if time is fundamental.

3:56:28.580 --> 3:56:30.340
 Because otherwise it's all the rest of us,

3:56:30.340 --> 3:56:33.340
 it's just sleight of hand because the physicists will say,

3:56:33.340 --> 3:56:35.340
 yes, everything's deterministic.

3:56:35.340 --> 3:56:38.540
 Newtonian mechanics is deterministic.

3:56:38.540 --> 3:56:40.540
 Quantum mechanics is deterministic.

3:56:40.540 --> 3:56:42.460
 Let's take the Everettian view.

3:56:42.460 --> 3:56:44.060
 And then basically we can just draw out

3:56:44.060 --> 3:56:46.980
 this massive universe branching, but it closes again

3:56:46.980 --> 3:56:48.020
 and we get it all back.

3:56:48.020 --> 3:56:50.940
 And don't worry, your feeling of free will is effective.

3:56:51.980 --> 3:56:53.540
 But what the physicists are actually saying

3:56:53.540 --> 3:56:55.500
 is the entire future is mapped out.

3:56:55.500 --> 3:56:59.180
 And that is clearly problematical.

3:57:00.060 --> 3:57:01.600
 And clearly.

3:57:03.780 --> 3:57:05.100
 That's not so clear.

3:57:05.100 --> 3:57:05.940
 Yeah.

3:57:05.940 --> 3:57:07.860
 It's just problematic.

3:57:07.860 --> 3:57:10.300
 Well, yeah, yeah, so it's.

3:57:10.300 --> 3:57:12.100
 Because that maybe is just the way it is.

3:57:12.100 --> 3:57:14.260
 It's problematic to you, a particular creature

3:57:14.260 --> 3:57:15.100
 along this timeline.

3:57:15.100 --> 3:57:16.540
 I want to reduce the number of beliefs

3:57:16.540 --> 3:57:18.540
 I need to understand the universe.

3:57:18.540 --> 3:57:21.260
 So if time is fundamental, I don't need

3:57:21.260 --> 3:57:24.020
 to have magic order at the beginning,

3:57:24.020 --> 3:57:25.620
 and I don't need a second law.

3:57:25.620 --> 3:57:27.420
 But you do need the magical belief

3:57:27.420 --> 3:57:28.820
 that time is fundamental.

3:57:28.820 --> 3:57:32.220
 Well, I need the observation that I'm seeing

3:57:32.220 --> 3:57:34.420
 to be just how it is all the way down.

3:57:34.420 --> 3:57:36.020
 But the Earth also looks flat

3:57:37.220 --> 3:57:40.820
 if you agree with your observation.

3:57:40.820 --> 3:57:43.460
 So we can't necessarily trust our observation.

3:57:43.460 --> 3:57:44.620
 I know the Earth isn't flat

3:57:44.620 --> 3:57:46.340
 because I can send a satellite into space.

3:57:46.340 --> 3:57:49.020
 No, but now you see, now you're using the tools

3:57:49.020 --> 3:57:51.260
 of science and the technology of science.

3:57:51.260 --> 3:57:53.180
 But I'm saying I'm going to do experiments

3:57:53.180 --> 3:57:55.100
 that start to show.

3:57:55.100 --> 3:57:57.380
 I mean, I think that it's worth.

3:57:57.380 --> 3:58:01.020
 So if you can't, so if I cannot do an experiment

3:58:01.020 --> 3:58:04.620
 or a thought experiment that will test this assumption,

3:58:04.620 --> 3:58:07.740
 then the assumption is without merit really in the end.

3:58:07.740 --> 3:58:09.500
 You know, that's fine.

3:58:09.500 --> 3:58:10.340
 Yeah.

3:58:10.340 --> 3:58:12.300
 That's a beautiful ideal you hold yourself to.

3:58:12.300 --> 3:58:17.300
 That's given that you think deeply in a philosophical way,

3:58:18.740 --> 3:58:21.820
 you think about some of these really important issues

3:58:21.820 --> 3:58:25.900
 and you have theoretical frameworks like assembly theory.

3:58:27.140 --> 3:58:29.980
 It's really nice that you're always grounded

3:58:29.980 --> 3:58:31.340
 with experiment.

3:58:31.340 --> 3:58:32.180
 That's all I have.

3:58:32.180 --> 3:58:33.260
 That's so refreshing.

3:58:33.260 --> 3:58:35.300
 That's so beautifully refreshing.

3:58:35.300 --> 3:58:39.380
 Now that we're holding you to the grounded

3:58:39.380 --> 3:58:42.300
 in an experiment to the harsh truth of reality,

3:58:42.300 --> 3:58:45.220
 let me ask the big ridiculous question.

3:58:45.220 --> 3:58:47.420
 What is the meaning of this whole thing?

3:58:47.420 --> 3:58:48.980
 What's the meaning of life?

3:58:48.980 --> 3:58:49.940
 Why?

3:58:49.940 --> 3:58:52.660
 This time is fundamental.

3:58:52.660 --> 3:58:54.020
 It's marching forward.

3:58:54.900 --> 3:58:58.900
 And along this long timeline come along a bunch

3:58:58.900 --> 3:59:03.460
 of descendants of apes that have come up

3:59:03.460 --> 3:59:07.500
 with cellular automata and computers and now computers.

3:59:07.500 --> 3:59:09.780
 Why?

3:59:09.780 --> 3:59:11.820
 I have so many different answers to this question.

3:59:11.820 --> 3:59:13.820
 It depends on what day.

3:59:13.820 --> 3:59:16.060
 I would say that given the way of the conversation

3:59:16.060 --> 3:59:18.500
 we had today, I'd say the meaning,

3:59:18.500 --> 3:59:19.900
 well, we make our own meaning.

3:59:19.900 --> 3:59:20.940
 I think that's fine.

3:59:20.940 --> 3:59:24.700
 But I think the universe wants to explore

3:59:24.700 --> 3:59:27.420
 every possible configuration that it's allowed us

3:59:27.420 --> 3:59:28.620
 to explore.

3:59:28.620 --> 3:59:30.420
 And this goes back to the kind of question

3:59:30.420 --> 3:59:33.300
 that you were asking about Yasha and the existence

3:59:33.300 --> 3:59:35.220
 and non existence of things, right?

3:59:35.220 --> 3:59:37.540
 So if the universe is a Turing machine is churning

3:59:37.540 --> 3:59:41.020
 through a lot of states and you think about

3:59:41.020 --> 3:59:43.100
 combinatorial theory before assembly theory,

3:59:43.100 --> 3:59:45.260
 so everything is possible.

3:59:45.260 --> 3:59:48.020
 What Yasha and I were saying is, well,

3:59:48.020 --> 3:59:49.860
 not everything is possible.

3:59:49.860 --> 3:59:52.020
 We don't see the combinatorial explosion.

3:59:52.020 --> 3:59:53.740
 We see something else.

3:59:53.740 --> 3:59:57.740
 And what we see is evidence of memory.

3:59:57.740 --> 4:00:00.500
 So there clearly seems to be some interference

4:00:00.500 --> 4:00:04.140
 between the combinatorial explosion of things

4:00:04.140 --> 4:00:06.140
 and what the universe allows.

4:00:06.140 --> 4:00:08.220
 And it's like this kind of constructive,

4:00:08.220 --> 4:00:09.780
 destructive interference.

4:00:10.660 --> 4:00:13.620
 So maybe the universe is not just about,

4:00:14.900 --> 4:00:18.220
 it is assembling objects in space and time.

4:00:18.220 --> 4:00:22.140
 And those objects are able to search more space and time.

4:00:22.140 --> 4:00:24.260
 And the universe is just infinitely creative.

4:00:24.260 --> 4:00:27.300
 And I guess I'm searching for why the universe

4:00:27.300 --> 4:00:28.380
 is infinitely creative.

4:00:28.380 --> 4:00:29.460
 It is infinitely creative.

4:00:29.460 --> 4:00:31.380
 And maybe the meaning is just simply to make

4:00:31.380 --> 4:00:34.780
 as many objects, create as many things as possible.

4:00:34.780 --> 4:00:37.180
 And I see a future of the universe that doesn't result

4:00:37.180 --> 4:00:38.700
 in the heat death of the universe.

4:00:38.700 --> 4:00:41.940
 The universe is gonna extract every ounce

4:00:41.940 --> 4:00:43.820
 of creativity it can out of it,

4:00:43.820 --> 4:00:45.860
 because that's what we see on Earth, right?

4:00:45.860 --> 4:00:49.020
 And if you think that almost like intelligence

4:00:49.020 --> 4:00:52.340
 is not conserved, that maybe creativity isn't either.

4:00:52.340 --> 4:00:56.980
 Maybe like it's an infinite well.

4:00:56.980 --> 4:01:00.420
 So like creativity is ultimately tied to novelty.

4:01:00.420 --> 4:01:03.660
 You're coming up with cool new configurations of things,

4:01:03.660 --> 4:01:06.300
 and maybe that just can continue indefinitely.

4:01:06.300 --> 4:01:09.900
 And this human species that was created along the way

4:01:09.900 --> 4:01:13.340
 is probably just one method,

4:01:13.340 --> 4:01:16.580
 like that's able to ask the universe about itself.

4:01:16.580 --> 4:01:19.460
 It's just one way to explore creativity.

4:01:19.460 --> 4:01:22.660
 Maybe there's other meta levels on top of that.

4:01:22.660 --> 4:01:24.860
 Like obviously, as a collective intelligence

4:01:24.860 --> 4:01:27.940
 will create organisms, maybe there'll be organisms

4:01:27.940 --> 4:01:32.540
 that ask themselves questions about themselves

4:01:33.500 --> 4:01:38.180
 in a deeper, bigger picture way than we humans do.

4:01:38.180 --> 4:01:39.780
 First to ask questions about the humans,

4:01:39.780 --> 4:01:42.900
 and then construct some kind of hybrid systems

4:01:42.900 --> 4:01:45.500
 that ask themselves about the collective aspect.

4:01:45.500 --> 4:01:47.080
 Just like some weird stacking

4:01:47.080 --> 4:01:49.060
 that we can't even imagine yet.

4:01:49.060 --> 4:01:51.060
 And that stacking, I mean, I have discussed this stacking

4:01:51.060 --> 4:01:54.060
 a lot with Sarah Walker, who's a professor of physics

4:01:54.060 --> 4:01:57.420
 and astrobiology at ASU.

4:01:57.420 --> 4:02:02.060
 And we argue about how creative the universe is gonna be,

4:02:02.060 --> 4:02:03.860
 and is it as deterministic as all that?

4:02:03.860 --> 4:02:07.620
 Because I think she's more of a free will thinker,

4:02:07.620 --> 4:02:10.080
 and I'm of a less free will thinker,

4:02:10.080 --> 4:02:12.220
 but I think we're beginning to converge

4:02:12.220 --> 4:02:13.980
 and understanding that.

4:02:13.980 --> 4:02:15.980
 Because there's simply a missing understanding.

4:02:15.980 --> 4:02:19.020
 Right now, we don't understand how the universe,

4:02:19.020 --> 4:02:21.340
 we don't know what rules the universe has

4:02:21.340 --> 4:02:23.460
 to allow the universe to contemplate itself.

4:02:23.460 --> 4:02:25.140
 So asking the meaning of it

4:02:25.140 --> 4:02:27.340
 before we even know what those rules are

4:02:27.340 --> 4:02:30.660
 is premature, but my guess is that it's not meaningless,

4:02:30.660 --> 4:02:32.060
 and it isn't just about that.

4:02:32.060 --> 4:02:33.880
 And there are three levels of meanings.

4:02:33.880 --> 4:02:35.820
 Obviously, the universe wants us to do stuff.

4:02:35.820 --> 4:02:36.900
 We're interacting with each other,

4:02:36.900 --> 4:02:38.540
 so we create meaning in our own society

4:02:38.540 --> 4:02:41.220
 and our own interactions with humanity.

4:02:41.220 --> 4:02:44.460
 But I do think there is something else going on.

4:02:44.460 --> 4:02:47.660
 But because reality is so weird,

4:02:47.660 --> 4:02:49.980
 we're just scratching at that.

4:02:49.980 --> 4:02:52.960
 And I think that we have to make the experiments better.

4:02:52.960 --> 4:02:56.580
 And we have to perhaps join across,

4:02:56.580 --> 4:02:58.620
 not just for the computation lists.

4:02:58.620 --> 4:03:01.140
 And what I tried to do with Yashua is meet him halfway,

4:03:01.140 --> 4:03:03.220
 say, well, what happens if I become a computation list?

4:03:03.220 --> 4:03:04.260
 What do I gain?

4:03:04.260 --> 4:03:05.660
 A lot, it turns out,

4:03:05.660 --> 4:03:08.180
 because I can make Turing machines in the universe.

4:03:08.180 --> 4:03:09.860
 Because on the one hand, I'm making computers

4:03:09.860 --> 4:03:12.020
 which are state machines inspired by Turing.

4:03:12.020 --> 4:03:14.580
 On the other hand, I'm saying they can't exist.

4:03:14.580 --> 4:03:16.940
 Well, clearly, I can't have my cake and eat it,

4:03:16.940 --> 4:03:18.960
 so there's something weird going on there.

4:03:18.960 --> 4:03:21.280
 So then, did the universe have to make a continuous

4:03:21.280 --> 4:03:23.820
 to a discrete transition, or is the universe just discrete?

4:03:23.820 --> 4:03:25.380
 It's probably just discrete.

4:03:25.380 --> 4:03:27.500
 So if it's just discrete, then there are,

4:03:27.500 --> 4:03:31.260
 I will then give Yashua his Turing like property

4:03:31.260 --> 4:03:32.100
 in the universe.

4:03:32.100 --> 4:03:33.620
 But maybe there's something else below it,

4:03:33.620 --> 4:03:36.660
 which is the constructor that constructs a Turing machine

4:03:36.660 --> 4:03:38.700
 that then constructs, you know,

4:03:38.700 --> 4:03:42.920
 it's a bit like you generate a computing system

4:03:42.920 --> 4:03:44.620
 that then is able to build an abstraction

4:03:44.620 --> 4:03:48.520
 that then recognizes it can make a generalizable abstraction

4:03:48.520 --> 4:03:50.780
 because human beings with mathematics

4:03:50.780 --> 4:03:55.200
 have been able to go on and build physical computers.

4:03:55.200 --> 4:03:57.060
 If that makes any sense.

4:03:57.060 --> 4:03:58.100
 And I think that's the meaning.

4:03:58.100 --> 4:04:00.820
 I think that's, you know, as far as we can,

4:04:00.820 --> 4:04:02.400
 the meaning will be further elucidated

4:04:02.400 --> 4:04:03.740
 with further experiments.

4:04:06.780 --> 4:04:08.420
 Well, you mentioned Sarah.

4:04:08.420 --> 4:04:11.420
 I think you and Sarah Walker

4:04:11.420 --> 4:04:14.460
 are just these fascinating human beings.

4:04:14.460 --> 4:04:18.540
 I'm really fortunate to have the opportunity

4:04:18.540 --> 4:04:20.140
 to be in your presence, to study your work,

4:04:20.140 --> 4:04:21.660
 to follow along with your work.

4:04:21.660 --> 4:04:23.720
 I'm a big fan.

4:04:23.720 --> 4:04:25.600
 Like I told you offline,

4:04:25.600 --> 4:04:27.400
 I hope we get a chance to talk again

4:04:27.400 --> 4:04:29.900
 with perhaps just the two of us,

4:04:29.900 --> 4:04:30.840
 but also with Sarah.

4:04:30.840 --> 4:04:35.340
 That's a fascinating dynamic for people who haven't heard.

4:04:35.340 --> 4:04:38.240
 I suppose on Clubhouse is where I heard you guys talk,

4:04:38.240 --> 4:04:39.940
 but you have an incredible dynamic.

4:04:39.940 --> 4:04:43.220
 And I also can't wait to hear you and Yashua talk.

4:04:43.220 --> 4:04:48.180
 So I think if there's some point in this predetermined

4:04:48.180 --> 4:04:54.140
 or yet to be determined future where the three of us,

4:04:54.140 --> 4:04:56.620
 you and Sarah, or the four of us with Yashua

4:04:56.620 --> 4:04:59.340
 could meet and talk would be a beautiful future.

4:04:59.340 --> 4:05:02.140
 And I look forward to most futures,

4:05:02.140 --> 4:05:04.620
 but I look forward to that one in particular.

4:05:04.620 --> 4:05:06.100
 Lee, thank you so much

4:05:06.100 --> 4:05:08.300
 for spending your valuable time with me today.

4:05:08.300 --> 4:05:09.120
 Thanks, Lex.

4:05:09.120 --> 4:05:10.660
 It's been a pleasure.

4:05:10.660 --> 4:05:13.620
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Lee Cronin.

4:05:13.620 --> 4:05:15.120

4:05:18.120 --> 4:05:20.420
 And now let me leave you with some words

4:05:20.420 --> 4:05:22.460
 from the math scientist, Rick Sanchez

4:05:22.460 --> 4:05:24.000
 of Rick and Morty fame.

4:05:25.140 --> 4:05:27.540
 To live is to risk it all.

4:05:28.460 --> 4:05:31.860
 Otherwise you're just an inert chunk

4:05:31.860 --> 4:05:34.240
 of randomly assembled molecules

4:05:34.240 --> 4:05:36.880
 drifting wherever the universe blows you.

4:05:36.880 --> 4:05:49.880
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
