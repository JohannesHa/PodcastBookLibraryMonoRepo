00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
 The following is a conversation with Brett Weinstein,

00:03.120 --> 00:05.960
 evolutionary biologist, author, cohost

00:05.960 --> 00:09.240
 of the Dark Horse podcast, and, as he says,

00:09.240 --> 00:11.160
 reluctant radical.

00:11.160 --> 00:14.200
 Even though we've never met or spoken before this,

00:14.200 --> 00:17.440
 we both felt like we've been friends for a long time,

00:17.440 --> 00:19.680
 I don't agree on everything with Brett,

00:19.680 --> 00:22.060
 but I'm sure as hell happy he exists

00:22.060 --> 00:25.120
 in this weird and wonderful world of ours.

00:25.120 --> 00:27.040
 Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:27.040 --> 00:30.920
 Jordan Harmon's show, ExpressVPN, Magic Spoon,

00:30.920 --> 00:32.480
 and Four Sigmatic.

00:32.480 --> 00:35.920
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:35.920 --> 00:39.280
 As a side note, let me say a few words about COVID 19

00:39.280 --> 00:41.240
 and about science broadly.

00:41.240 --> 00:44.240
 I think science is beautiful and powerful.

00:44.240 --> 00:46.600
 It is the striving of the human mind

00:46.600 --> 00:50.100
 to understand and to solve the problems of the world.

00:50.100 --> 00:51.520
 But as an institution,

00:51.520 --> 00:54.260
 it is susceptible to the flaws of human nature,

00:54.260 --> 00:58.360
 to fear, to greed, power, and ego.

00:58.360 --> 01:00.600
 2020 is the story of all of these

01:00.600 --> 01:04.140
 that has both scientific triumph and tragedy.

01:04.140 --> 01:07.260
 We needed great leaders and we didn't get them.

01:07.260 --> 01:09.380
 What we needed is leaders who communicate

01:09.380 --> 01:12.040
 in an honest, transparent, and authentic way

01:12.040 --> 01:14.060
 about the uncertainty of what we know

01:14.060 --> 01:16.100
 and the large scale scientific efforts

01:16.100 --> 01:19.600
 to reduce that uncertainty and to develop solutions.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.840
 I believe there are several candidates for solutions

01:21.840 --> 01:25.340
 that could have all saved hundreds of billions of dollars

01:25.340 --> 01:27.840
 and lessened or eliminated

01:27.840 --> 01:30.200
 the suffering of millions of people.

01:30.200 --> 01:33.020
 Let me mention five of the categories of solutions.

01:33.020 --> 01:37.040
 Masks, at home testing, anonymized contact tracing,

01:37.040 --> 01:39.540
 antiviral drugs, and vaccines.

01:39.540 --> 01:41.280
 Within each of these categories,

01:41.280 --> 01:44.120
 institutional leaders should have constantly asked

01:44.120 --> 01:46.880
 and answered publicly, honestly,

01:46.880 --> 01:48.880
 the following three questions.

01:48.880 --> 01:52.000
 One, what data do we have on the solution

01:52.000 --> 01:53.280
 and what studies are we running

01:53.280 --> 01:55.160
 to get more and better data?

01:55.160 --> 01:57.920
 Two, given the current data and uncertainty,

01:57.920 --> 02:01.180
 how effective and how safe is the solution?

02:01.180 --> 02:04.200
 Three, what is the timeline and cost involved

02:04.200 --> 02:07.460
 with mass manufacturing distribution of the solution?

02:07.460 --> 02:09.000
 In the service of these questions,

02:09.000 --> 02:11.080
 no voices should have been silenced,

02:11.080 --> 02:13.120
 no ideas left off the table.

02:13.120 --> 02:15.040
 Open data, open science,

02:15.040 --> 02:17.620
 open, honest scientific communication and debate

02:17.620 --> 02:20.280
 was the way, not censorship.

02:20.280 --> 02:21.960
 There are a lot of ideas out there

02:21.960 --> 02:24.840
 that are bad, wrong, dangerous,

02:24.840 --> 02:26.840
 but the moment we have the hubris

02:26.840 --> 02:29.680
 to say we know which ideas those are

02:29.680 --> 02:32.500
 is the moment we'll lose our ability to find the truth,

02:32.500 --> 02:33.920
 to find solutions,

02:33.920 --> 02:37.840
 the very things that make science beautiful and powerful

02:37.840 --> 02:40.500
 in the face of all the dangers that threaten the wellbeing

02:40.500 --> 02:43.600
 and the existence of humans on Earth.

02:43.600 --> 02:44.880
 This conversation with Brett

02:44.880 --> 02:46.840
 is less about the ideas we talk about.

02:46.840 --> 02:49.000
 We agree on some, disagree on others.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.280
 It is much more about the very freedom to talk,

02:52.280 --> 02:54.960
 to think, to share ideas.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.320
 This freedom is our only hope.

02:57.320 --> 03:00.040
 Brett should never have been censored.

03:00.040 --> 03:03.360
 I asked Brett to do this podcast to show solidarity

03:03.360 --> 03:07.360
 and to show that I have hope for science and for humanity.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.160
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast

03:10.160 --> 03:13.400
 and here's my conversation with Brett Weinstein.

03:13.400 --> 03:18.080
 What to you is beautiful about the study of biology,

03:18.080 --> 03:21.000
 the science, the engineering, the philosophy of it?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.320
 It's a very interesting question.

03:22.320 --> 03:27.320
 I must say at one level, it's not a conscious thing.

03:27.520 --> 03:30.700
 I can say a lot about why as an adult

03:30.700 --> 03:32.100
 I find biology compelling,

03:32.100 --> 03:36.720
 but as a kid I was completely fascinated with animals.

03:36.720 --> 03:40.280
 I loved to watch them and think about why they did

03:40.280 --> 03:44.920
 what they did and that developed into a very conscious

03:44.920 --> 03:46.520
 passion as an adult.

03:46.520 --> 03:51.520
 But I think in the same way that one is drawn to a person,

03:51.760 --> 03:56.760
 I was drawn to the never ending series of near miracles

03:59.320 --> 04:02.440
 that exists across biological nature.

04:02.440 --> 04:03.840
 When you see a living organism,

04:03.840 --> 04:08.160
 do you see it from an evolutionary biology perspective

04:08.160 --> 04:10.080
 of like this entire thing that moves around

04:10.080 --> 04:14.200
 in this world or do you see from an engineering perspective

04:14.200 --> 04:18.000
 that first principles almost down to the physics,

04:18.000 --> 04:21.200
 like the little components that build up hierarchies

04:21.200 --> 04:24.760
 that you have cells, the first proteins and cells

04:24.760 --> 04:27.160
 and organs and all that kind of stuff.

04:27.160 --> 04:29.880
 So do you see low level or do you see high level?

04:30.820 --> 04:32.760
 Well, the human mind is a strange thing

04:32.760 --> 04:37.760
 and I think it's probably a bit like a time sharing machine

04:37.760 --> 04:40.360
 in which I have different modules.

04:40.360 --> 04:43.360
 We don't know enough about biology for them to connect.

04:43.360 --> 04:46.240
 So they exist in isolation and I'm always aware

04:46.240 --> 04:48.880
 that they do connect, but I basically have to step

04:48.880 --> 04:53.760
 into a module in order to see the evolutionary dynamics

04:53.760 --> 04:56.940
 of the creature and the lineage that it belongs to.

04:56.940 --> 04:59.040
 I have to step into a different module to think

04:59.040 --> 05:02.240
 of that lineage over a very long time scale,

05:02.240 --> 05:04.400
 a different module still to understand

05:04.400 --> 05:06.940
 what the mechanisms inside would have to look like

05:06.940 --> 05:11.080
 to account for what we can see from the outside.

05:11.080 --> 05:15.960
 And I think that probably sounds really complicated,

05:15.960 --> 05:20.680
 but one of the things about being involved

05:20.680 --> 05:25.160
 in a topic like biology and doing so for one,

05:25.160 --> 05:27.480
 really not even just my adult life for my whole life

05:27.480 --> 05:29.400
 is that it becomes second nature.

05:29.400 --> 05:34.400
 And when we see somebody do an amazing parkour routine

05:34.400 --> 05:38.920
 or something like that, we think about what they must

05:38.920 --> 05:41.440
 be doing in order to accomplish that.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.720
 But of course, what they are doing is tapping

05:43.720 --> 05:46.280
 into some kind of zone, right?

05:46.280 --> 05:51.280
 They are in a zone in which they are in such command

05:51.420 --> 05:53.660
 of their center of gravity, for example,

05:53.660 --> 05:56.840
 that they know how to hurl it around a landscape

05:56.840 --> 05:59.000
 so that they always land on their feet.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
 And I would just say for anyone who hasn't found a topic

06:04.960 --> 06:08.780
 on which they can develop that kind of facility,

06:08.780 --> 06:11.500
 it is absolutely worthwhile.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.700
 It's really something that human beings are capable

06:13.700 --> 06:16.280
 of doing across a wide range of topics,

06:16.280 --> 06:19.560
 many things our ancestors didn't even have access to.

06:19.560 --> 06:21.980
 And that flexibility of humans,

06:21.980 --> 06:26.120
 that ability to repurpose our machinery

06:26.120 --> 06:29.980
 for topics that are novel means really,

06:29.980 --> 06:30.940
 the world is your oyster.

06:30.940 --> 06:32.900
 You can figure out what your passion is

06:32.900 --> 06:34.780
 and then figure out all of the angles

06:34.780 --> 06:38.140
 that one would have to pursue to really deeply understand it.

06:38.140 --> 06:42.820
 And it is well worth having at least one topic like that.

06:42.820 --> 06:45.700
 You mean embracing the full adaptability

06:45.700 --> 06:49.360
 of both the body and the mind.

06:49.360 --> 06:53.440
 So like, I don't know what to attribute the parkour to,

06:53.440 --> 06:56.580
 like biomechanics of how our bodies can move,

06:56.580 --> 06:58.020
 or is it the mind?

06:58.020 --> 07:00.120
 Like how much percent wise,

07:00.120 --> 07:04.780
 is it the entirety of the hierarchies of biology

07:04.780 --> 07:06.100
 that we've been talking about,

07:06.100 --> 07:09.380
 or is it just all the mind?

07:09.380 --> 07:10.740
 The way to think about creatures

07:10.740 --> 07:14.180
 is that every creature is two things simultaneously.

07:14.180 --> 07:17.940
 A creature is a machine of sorts, right?

07:17.940 --> 07:20.580
 It's not a machine in the,

07:20.580 --> 07:22.620
 I call it an aqueous machine, right?

07:22.620 --> 07:24.860
 And it's run by an aqueous computer, right?

07:24.860 --> 07:29.060
 So it's not identical to our technological machines.

07:29.060 --> 07:31.900
 But every creature is both a machine

07:31.900 --> 07:33.180
 that does things in the world

07:33.180 --> 07:36.380
 sufficient to accumulate enough resources

07:36.380 --> 07:39.600
 to continue surviving, to reproduce.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.520
 It is also a potential.

07:41.520 --> 07:45.580
 So each creature is potentially, for example,

07:45.580 --> 07:47.220
 the most recent common ancestor

07:47.220 --> 07:48.800
 of some future clade of creatures

07:48.800 --> 07:50.500
 that will look very different from it.

07:50.500 --> 07:53.780
 And if a creature is very, very good at being a creature,

07:53.780 --> 07:56.240
 but not very good in terms of the potential

07:56.240 --> 07:57.740
 it has going forward,

07:57.740 --> 08:01.400
 then that lineage will not last very long into the future

08:01.400 --> 08:04.980
 because change will throw at challenges

08:04.980 --> 08:07.260
 that its descendants will not be able to meet.

08:07.260 --> 08:12.260
 So the thing about humans is we are a generalist platform,

08:13.560 --> 08:17.500
 and we have the ability to swap out our software

08:17.500 --> 08:20.740
 to exist in many, many different niches.

08:20.740 --> 08:24.140
 And I was once watching an interview

08:24.140 --> 08:27.060
 with this British group of parkour experts

08:27.060 --> 08:31.120
 who were being, they were discussing what it is they do

08:31.120 --> 08:31.960
 and how it works.

08:31.960 --> 08:33.300
 And what they essentially said is,

08:33.300 --> 08:38.300
 look, you're tapping into deep monkey stuff, right?

08:39.300 --> 08:41.720
 And I thought, yeah, that's about right.

08:41.720 --> 08:46.180
 And anybody who is proficient at something

08:46.180 --> 08:49.700
 like skiing or skateboarding, you know,

08:49.700 --> 08:54.580
 has the experience of flying down the hill

08:54.580 --> 08:56.220
 on skis, for example,

08:56.220 --> 08:59.920
 bouncing from the top of one mogul to the next.

08:59.920 --> 09:02.520
 And if you really pay attention,

09:02.520 --> 09:04.360
 you will discover that your conscious mind

09:04.360 --> 09:05.600
 is actually a spectator.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.160
 It's there, it's involved in the experience,

09:08.160 --> 09:09.060
 but it's not driving.

09:09.060 --> 09:10.340
 Some part of you knows how to ski,

09:10.340 --> 09:12.720
 and it's not the part of you that knows how to think.

09:12.720 --> 09:17.180
 And I would just say that what accounts

09:17.180 --> 09:19.900
 for this flexibility in humans

09:19.900 --> 09:23.180
 is the ability to bootstrap a new software program

09:24.040 --> 09:27.120
 and then drive it into the unconscious layer

09:27.120 --> 09:30.000
 where it can be applied very rapidly.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.740
 And, you know, I will be shocked

09:31.740 --> 09:36.100
 if the exact thing doesn't exist in robotics.

09:36.100 --> 09:37.920
 You know, if you programmed a robot

09:37.920 --> 09:40.220
 to deal with circumstances that were novel to it,

09:40.220 --> 09:41.060
 how would you do it?

09:41.060 --> 09:43.100
 It would have to look something like this.

09:43.100 --> 09:46.180
 There's a certain kind of magic, you're right,

09:46.180 --> 09:48.620
 with the consciousness being an observer.

09:48.620 --> 09:51.620
 When you play guitar, for example, or piano for me,

09:51.620 --> 09:55.460
 music, when you get truly lost in it,

09:55.460 --> 09:57.740
 I don't know what the heck is responsible

09:57.740 --> 09:59.100
 for the flow of the music,

09:59.100 --> 10:02.820
 the kind of the loudness of the music going up and down,

10:02.820 --> 10:06.280
 the timing, the intricate, like even the mistakes,

10:06.280 --> 10:07.120
 all those things,

10:07.120 --> 10:09.260
 that doesn't seem to be the conscious mind.

10:09.260 --> 10:12.020
 It is just observing,

10:12.020 --> 10:14.540
 and yet it's somehow intricately involved.

10:14.540 --> 10:17.180
 More, like, because you mentioned parkour,

10:17.180 --> 10:18.820
 the dance is like that too.

10:18.820 --> 10:20.860
 When you start up in tango dancing,

10:20.860 --> 10:24.020
 if when you truly lose yourself in it,

10:24.020 --> 10:26.940
 then it's just like you're an observer,

10:26.940 --> 10:29.060
 and how the hell is the body able to do that?

10:29.060 --> 10:31.220
 And not only that, it's the physical motion

10:31.220 --> 10:33.900
 is also creating the emotion,

10:33.900 --> 10:38.900
 the, like, the damn is good to be alive feeling.

10:40.540 --> 10:44.460
 So, but then that's also intricately connected

10:44.460 --> 10:47.660
 to the full biology stack that we're operating in.

10:47.660 --> 10:50.140
 I don't know how difficult it is to replicate that.

10:50.140 --> 10:53.540
 We're talking offline about Boston Dynamics robots.

10:54.880 --> 10:57.980
 They've recently been, they did both parkour,

10:57.980 --> 11:01.100
 they did flips, they've also done some dancing,

11:02.180 --> 11:03.540
 and it's something I think a lot about

11:03.540 --> 11:07.940
 because what most people don't realize

11:07.940 --> 11:09.580
 because they don't look deep enough

11:09.580 --> 11:13.980
 is those robots are hard coded to do those things.

11:13.980 --> 11:16.940
 The robots didn't figure it out by themselves,

11:16.940 --> 11:20.620
 and yet the fundamental aspect of what it means to be human

11:20.620 --> 11:23.900
 is that process of figuring out, of making mistakes,

11:23.900 --> 11:26.240
 and then there's something about overcoming

11:26.240 --> 11:27.940
 those challenges and the mistakes

11:27.940 --> 11:30.100
 and, like, figuring out how to lose yourself

11:30.100 --> 11:34.100
 in the magic of the dancing or just movement

11:34.100 --> 11:35.540
 is what it means to be human.

11:35.540 --> 11:38.620
 That learning process, so that's what I want to do

11:38.620 --> 11:42.260
 with the, almost as a fun side thing

11:42.260 --> 11:44.700
 with the Boston Dynamics robots,

11:44.700 --> 11:48.400
 is to have them learn and see what they figure out,

11:48.400 --> 11:50.940
 even if they make mistakes.

11:50.940 --> 11:55.140
 I want to let Spot make mistakes

11:55.140 --> 12:00.060
 and in so doing discover what it means to be alive,

12:00.060 --> 12:02.060
 discover beauty, because I think

12:02.060 --> 12:04.520
 that's the essential aspect of mistakes.

12:05.380 --> 12:09.300
 Boston Dynamics folks want Spot to be perfect

12:09.300 --> 12:11.620
 because they don't want Spot to ever make mistakes

12:11.620 --> 12:13.540
 because it wants to operate in the factories,

12:13.540 --> 12:16.580
 it wants to be very safe and so on.

12:16.580 --> 12:19.060
 For me, if you construct the environment,

12:19.060 --> 12:21.420
 if you construct a safe space for robots

12:22.300 --> 12:24.360
 and allow them to make mistakes,

12:24.360 --> 12:26.740
 something beautiful might be discovered,

12:26.740 --> 12:29.820
 but that requires a lot of brain power.

12:29.820 --> 12:32.060
 So Spot is currently very dumb

12:32.060 --> 12:34.300
 and I'm gonna give it a brain.

12:34.300 --> 12:36.740
 So first make it see, currently it can't see,

12:36.740 --> 12:39.220
 meaning computer vision, it has to understand

12:39.220 --> 12:41.340
 its environment, it has to see all the humans,

12:41.340 --> 12:43.900
 but then also has to be able to learn,

12:43.900 --> 12:47.480
 learn about its movement, learn how to use its body

12:47.480 --> 12:49.940
 to communicate with others, all those kinds of things

12:49.940 --> 12:51.820
 that dogs know how to do well,

12:51.820 --> 12:54.020
 humans know how to do somewhat well.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.540
 I think that's a beautiful challenge,

12:56.540 --> 13:00.380
 but first you have to allow the robot to make mistakes.

13:00.380 --> 13:03.820
 Well, I think your objective is laudable,

13:03.820 --> 13:04.860
 but you're gonna realize

13:04.860 --> 13:07.380
 that the Boston Dynamics folks are right

13:07.380 --> 13:09.300
 the first time Spot poops on your rug.

13:11.580 --> 13:13.900
 I hear the same thing about kids and so on.

13:13.900 --> 13:14.980
 I still wanna have kids.

13:14.980 --> 13:18.060
 No, you should, it's a great experience.

13:18.060 --> 13:19.780
 So let me step back into what you said

13:19.780 --> 13:21.260
 in a couple of different places.

13:21.260 --> 13:24.740
 One, I have always believed that the missing element

13:24.740 --> 13:27.940
 in robotics and artificial intelligence

13:27.940 --> 13:30.420
 is a proper development, right?

13:30.420 --> 13:33.620
 It is no accident, it is no mere coincidence

13:33.620 --> 13:36.400
 that human beings are the most dominant species

13:36.400 --> 13:38.880
 on planet Earth and that we have the longest childhoods

13:38.880 --> 13:42.020
 of any creature on Earth by far, right?

13:42.020 --> 13:44.860
 The development is the key to the flexibility.

13:44.860 --> 13:49.860
 And so the capability of a human at adulthood

13:49.860 --> 13:53.780
 is the mirror image, it's the flip side

13:53.780 --> 13:57.300
 of our helplessness at birth.

13:57.300 --> 13:59.900
 So I'll be very interested to see what happens

13:59.900 --> 14:03.260
 in your robot project if you do not end up

14:03.260 --> 14:05.420
 reinventing childhood for robots,

14:05.420 --> 14:09.740
 which of course is foreshadowed in 2001 quite brilliantly.

14:10.820 --> 14:12.140
 But I also wanna point out,

14:12.140 --> 14:16.580
 you can see this issue of your conscious mind

14:16.580 --> 14:18.780
 becoming a spectator very well

14:18.780 --> 14:23.780
 if you compare tennis to table tennis, right?

14:24.740 --> 14:28.640
 If you watch a tennis game, you could imagine

14:28.640 --> 14:31.300
 that the players are highly conscious as they play.

14:32.500 --> 14:33.900
 You cannot imagine that

14:33.900 --> 14:36.680
 if you've ever played ping pong decently.

14:36.680 --> 14:39.440
 A volley in ping pong is so fast

14:39.440 --> 14:42.200
 that your conscious mind, if your reactions

14:42.200 --> 14:43.740
 had to go through your conscious mind,

14:43.740 --> 14:44.980
 you wouldn't be able to play.

14:44.980 --> 14:47.140
 So you can detect that your conscious mind,

14:47.140 --> 14:49.740
 while very much present, isn't there.

14:49.740 --> 14:52.140
 And you can also detect where consciousness

14:52.140 --> 14:54.540
 does usefully intrude.

14:54.540 --> 14:57.760
 If you go up against an opponent in table tennis

14:57.760 --> 15:01.780
 that knows a trick that you don't know how to respond to,

15:01.780 --> 15:03.500
 you will suddenly detect that something

15:03.500 --> 15:06.260
 about your game is not effective,

15:06.260 --> 15:08.220
 and you will start thinking about what might be,

15:08.220 --> 15:10.220
 how do you position yourself so that move

15:10.220 --> 15:12.460
 that puts the ball just in that corner of the table

15:12.460 --> 15:15.440
 or something like that doesn't catch you off guard.

15:15.440 --> 15:20.440
 And this, I believe, is we highly conscious folks,

15:22.160 --> 15:23.900
 those of us who try to think through things

15:23.900 --> 15:26.060
 very deliberately and carefully,

15:26.060 --> 15:30.280
 mistake consciousness for the highest kind of thinking.

15:30.280 --> 15:33.120
 And I really think that this is an error.

15:33.120 --> 15:36.280
 Consciousness is an intermediate level of thinking.

15:36.280 --> 15:37.720
 What it does is it allows you,

15:37.720 --> 15:40.120
 it's basically like uncompiled code.

15:40.120 --> 15:42.620
 And it doesn't run very fast.

15:42.620 --> 15:45.400
 It is capable of being adapted to new circumstances.

15:45.400 --> 15:48.460
 But once the code is roughed in,

15:48.460 --> 15:50.500
 it gets driven into the unconscious layer,

15:50.500 --> 15:52.860
 and you become highly effective at whatever it is.

15:52.860 --> 15:55.260
 And from that point, your conscious mind

15:55.260 --> 15:57.260
 basically remains there to detect things

15:57.260 --> 16:00.040
 that aren't anticipated by the code you've already written.

16:00.040 --> 16:05.040
 And so I don't exactly know how one would establish this,

16:05.340 --> 16:07.220
 how one would demonstrate it.

16:07.220 --> 16:10.580
 But it must be the case that the human mind

16:10.580 --> 16:15.400
 contains sandboxes in which things are tested, right?

16:15.400 --> 16:16.840
 Maybe you can build a piece of code

16:16.840 --> 16:19.880
 and run it in parallel next to your active code

16:19.880 --> 16:23.600
 so you can see how it would have done comparatively.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.480
 But there's gotta be some way of writing new code

16:26.480 --> 16:28.000
 and then swapping it in.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.720
 And frankly, I think this has a lot to do

16:29.720 --> 16:31.240
 with things like sleep cycles.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.100
 Very often, when I get good at something,

16:34.100 --> 16:36.720
 I often don't get better at it while I'm doing it.

16:36.720 --> 16:38.680
 I get better at it when I'm not doing it,

16:38.680 --> 16:41.720
 especially if there's time to sleep and think on it.

16:41.720 --> 16:44.440
 So there's some sort of new program

16:44.440 --> 16:46.940
 swapping in for old program phenomenon,

16:46.940 --> 16:50.880
 which will be a lot easier to see in machines.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.800
 It's gonna be hard with the wetware.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.520
 I like, I mean, it is true,

16:55.520 --> 16:56.760
 because somebody that played,

16:56.760 --> 16:58.760
 I played tennis for many years,

16:58.760 --> 17:01.880
 I do still think the highest form of excellence in tennis

17:01.880 --> 17:05.200
 is when the conscious mind is a spectator.

17:05.200 --> 17:10.200
 So the compiled code is the highest form of being human.

17:11.600 --> 17:16.360
 And then consciousness is just some specific compiler.

17:16.360 --> 17:19.760
 You used to have like Borland C++ compiler.

17:19.760 --> 17:22.160
 You could just have different kind of compilers.

17:22.160 --> 17:26.120
 Ultimately, the thing that by which we measure

17:28.560 --> 17:30.600
 the power of life, the intelligence of life

17:30.600 --> 17:31.800
 is the compiled code.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.880
 And you can probably do that compilation all kinds of ways.

17:34.880 --> 17:37.780
 Yeah, I'm not saying that tennis is played consciously

17:37.780 --> 17:38.880
 and table tennis isn't.

17:38.880 --> 17:41.460
 I'm saying that because tennis is slowed down

17:41.460 --> 17:43.760
 by the just the space on the court,

17:43.760 --> 17:47.080
 you could imagine that it was your conscious mind playing.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.840
 But when you shrink the court down,

17:48.840 --> 17:49.680
 It becomes obvious.

17:49.680 --> 17:51.400
 It becomes obvious that your conscious mind

17:51.400 --> 17:54.760
 is just present rather than knowing where to put the paddle.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.460
 And weirdly for me,

17:58.560 --> 17:59.740
 I would say this probably isn't true

17:59.740 --> 18:01.760
 in a podcast situation.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.960
 But if I have to give a presentation,

18:03.960 --> 18:06.960
 especially if I have not overly prepared,

18:06.960 --> 18:08.760
 I often find the same phenomenon

18:08.760 --> 18:10.080
 when I'm giving the presentation.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.600
 My conscious mind is there watching

18:11.600 --> 18:13.600
 some other part of me present,

18:13.600 --> 18:17.440
 which is a little jarring, I have to say.

18:17.440 --> 18:20.680
 Well, that means you've gotten good at it.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.520
 Not let the conscious mind get in the way

18:22.520 --> 18:24.720
 of the flow of words.

18:24.720 --> 18:27.120
 Yeah, that's the sensation to be sure.

18:27.120 --> 18:29.040
 And that's the highest form of podcasting too.

18:29.040 --> 18:32.240
 I mean, that's what it looks like

18:32.240 --> 18:34.200
 when a podcast is really in the pocket,

18:34.200 --> 18:38.640
 like Joe Rogan, just having fun

18:38.640 --> 18:39.880
 and just losing themselves.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.860
 And that's something I aspire to as well,

18:41.860 --> 18:43.500
 just losing yourself in conversation.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.680
 Somebody that has a lot of anxiety with people,

18:45.680 --> 18:47.200
 like I'm such an introvert.

18:47.200 --> 18:48.040
 I'm scared.

18:48.040 --> 18:49.280
 I was scared before you showed up.

18:49.280 --> 18:50.920
 I'm scared right now.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.080
 There's just anxiety.

18:52.080 --> 18:55.200
 There's just, it's a giant mess.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.600
 It's hard to lose yourself.

18:56.600 --> 19:00.700
 It's hard to just get out of the way of your own mind.

19:00.700 --> 19:04.960
 Yeah, actually, trust is a big component of that.

19:04.960 --> 19:08.080
 Your conscious mind retains control

19:08.080 --> 19:10.040
 if you are very uncertain.

19:11.080 --> 19:14.280
 But when you do get into that zone when you're speaking,

19:14.280 --> 19:15.440
 I realize it's different for you

19:15.440 --> 19:16.740
 with English as a second language,

19:16.740 --> 19:20.280
 although maybe you present in Russian and it happens.

19:20.280 --> 19:22.560
 But do you ever hear yourself say something

19:22.560 --> 19:25.080
 and you think, oh, that's really good, right?

19:25.080 --> 19:26.980
 Like you didn't come up with it,

19:26.980 --> 19:30.160
 some other part of you that you don't exactly know

19:30.160 --> 19:31.000
 came up with it?

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
 I don't think I've ever heard myself in that way

19:36.240 --> 19:38.180
 because I have a much louder voice

19:38.180 --> 19:41.360
 that's constantly yelling in my head at,

19:41.360 --> 19:43.520
 why the hell did you say that?

19:43.520 --> 19:47.360
 There's a very self critical voice that's much louder.

19:47.360 --> 19:51.320
 So I'm very, maybe I need to deal with that voice,

19:51.320 --> 19:53.160
 but it's been like, what is it called?

19:53.160 --> 19:54.640
 Like a megaphone just screaming

19:54.640 --> 19:56.600
 so I can't hear the other voice that says,

19:56.600 --> 19:58.600
 good job, you said that thing really nicely.

19:58.600 --> 20:02.320
 So I'm kind of focused right now on the megaphone person

20:02.320 --> 20:05.320
 in the audience versus the positive,

20:05.320 --> 20:07.200
 but that's definitely something to think about.

20:07.200 --> 20:12.200
 It's been productive, but the place where I find gratitude

20:12.960 --> 20:16.960
 and beauty and appreciation of life is in the quiet moments

20:16.960 --> 20:20.360
 when I don't talk, when I listen to the world around me,

20:20.360 --> 20:23.880
 when I listen to others, when I talk,

20:23.880 --> 20:26.800
 I'm extremely self critical in my mind.

20:26.800 --> 20:29.640
 When I produce anything out into the world

20:29.640 --> 20:32.000
 that originated with me,

20:32.000 --> 20:35.040
 like any kind of creation, extremely self critical.

20:35.040 --> 20:37.440
 It's good for productivity,

20:37.440 --> 20:40.760
 for always striving to improve and so on.

20:40.760 --> 20:45.040
 It might be bad for just appreciating

20:45.040 --> 20:46.160
 the things you've created.

20:46.160 --> 20:49.600
 I'm a little bit with Marvin Minsky on this

20:49.600 --> 20:54.600
 where he says the key to a productive life

20:54.600 --> 20:57.980
 is to hate everything you've ever done in the past.

20:57.980 --> 20:59.300
 I didn't know he said that.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.260
 I must say, I resonate with it a bit.

21:01.260 --> 21:06.260
 And unfortunately, my life currently has me putting

21:06.580 --> 21:08.660
 a lot of stuff into the world,

21:08.660 --> 21:12.020
 and I effectively watch almost none of it.

21:12.020 --> 21:12.900
 I can't stand it.

21:15.020 --> 21:16.780
 Yeah, what do you make of that?

21:16.780 --> 21:18.020
 I don't know.

21:18.020 --> 21:21.700
 I just yesterday read Metamorphosis by Kafka,

21:21.700 --> 21:23.620
 we read Metamorphosis by Kafka

21:23.620 --> 21:25.820
 where he turns into a giant bug

21:25.820 --> 21:29.060
 because of the stress that the world puts on him.

21:29.060 --> 21:31.620
 His parents put on him to succeed.

21:31.620 --> 21:35.500
 And I think that you have to find the balance

21:35.500 --> 21:39.620
 because if you allow the self critical voice

21:39.620 --> 21:41.780
 to become too heavy, the burden of the world,

21:41.780 --> 21:44.140
 the pressure that the world puts on you

21:44.140 --> 21:47.340
 to be the best version of yourself and so on to strive,

21:47.340 --> 21:51.780
 then you become a bug and that's a big problem.

21:51.780 --> 21:56.700
 And then the world turns against you because you're a bug.

21:56.700 --> 21:59.760
 You become some kind of caricature of yourself.

21:59.760 --> 22:03.900
 I don't know, you become the worst version of yourself

22:03.900 --> 22:07.940
 and then thereby end up destroying yourself

22:07.940 --> 22:09.580
 and then the world moves on.

22:09.580 --> 22:10.420
 That's the story.

22:10.420 --> 22:11.500
 That's a lovely story.

22:12.460 --> 22:14.820
 I do think this is one of these places,

22:14.820 --> 22:17.700
 and frankly, you could map this onto

22:17.700 --> 22:19.500
 all of modern human experience,

22:19.500 --> 22:20.820
 but this is one of these places

22:20.820 --> 22:23.300
 where our ancestral programming

22:23.300 --> 22:25.620
 does not serve our modern selves.

22:25.620 --> 22:27.240
 So I used to talk to students

22:27.240 --> 22:30.740
 about the question of dwelling on things.

22:30.740 --> 22:34.340
 Dwelling on things is famously understood to be bad

22:35.300 --> 22:36.700
 and it can't possibly be bad.

22:36.700 --> 22:38.300
 It wouldn't exist, the tendency toward it

22:38.300 --> 22:40.300
 wouldn't exist if it was bad.

22:40.300 --> 22:42.700
 So what is bad is dwelling on things

22:42.700 --> 22:45.360
 past the point of utility.

22:45.360 --> 22:49.660
 And that's obviously easier to say than to operationalize,

22:49.660 --> 22:53.300
 but if you realize that your dwelling is the key, in fact,

22:53.300 --> 22:57.000
 to upgrading your program for future well being

22:57.940 --> 23:00.100
 and that there's a point, presumably,

23:00.100 --> 23:03.780
 from diminishing returns, if not counter productivity,

23:03.780 --> 23:05.620
 there is a point at which you should stop

23:05.620 --> 23:08.340
 because that is what is in your best interest,

23:08.340 --> 23:12.140
 then knowing that you're looking for that point is useful.

23:12.140 --> 23:14.100
 This is the point at which it is no longer useful

23:14.100 --> 23:16.900
 for me to dwell on this error I have made.

23:16.900 --> 23:17.980
 That's what you're looking for.

23:17.980 --> 23:20.940
 And it also gives you license, right?

23:20.940 --> 23:23.820
 If some part of you feels like it's punishing you

23:23.820 --> 23:27.980
 rather than searching, then that also has a point

23:27.980 --> 23:29.700
 at which it's no longer valuable

23:29.700 --> 23:32.420
 and there's some liberty in realizing,

23:32.420 --> 23:35.260
 yep, even the part of me that was punishing me

23:35.260 --> 23:36.420
 knows it's time to stop.

23:37.340 --> 23:40.460
 So if we map that onto compiled code discussion,

23:40.460 --> 23:43.220
 as a computer science person, I find that very compelling.

23:43.220 --> 23:48.220
 You know, when you compile code, you get warnings sometimes.

23:48.700 --> 23:53.700
 And usually, if you're a good software engineer,

23:54.100 --> 23:56.500
 you're going to make sure there's no,

23:56.500 --> 23:58.900
 you know, you treat warnings as errors.

23:58.900 --> 24:02.260
 So you make sure that the compilation produces no warnings.

24:02.260 --> 24:05.180
 But at a certain point, when you have a large enough system,

24:05.180 --> 24:06.820
 you just let the warnings go.

24:06.820 --> 24:07.860
 It's fine.

24:07.860 --> 24:10.380
 Like, I don't know where that warning came from,

24:10.380 --> 24:15.140
 but, you know, just ultimately you need to compile the code

24:15.140 --> 24:19.180
 and run with it and hope nothing terrible happens.

24:19.180 --> 24:21.620
 Well, I think what you will find, and believe me,

24:21.620 --> 24:24.500
 I think what you're talking about

24:24.500 --> 24:27.700
 with respect to robots and learning

24:27.700 --> 24:31.900
 is gonna end up having to go to a deep developmental state

24:31.900 --> 24:34.940
 and a helplessness that evolves into hyper competence

24:34.940 --> 24:36.020
 and all of that.

24:36.020 --> 24:41.020
 But I live, I noticed that I live by something

24:41.460 --> 24:44.140
 that I, for lack of a better descriptor,

24:44.140 --> 24:46.060
 call the theory of close calls.

24:47.140 --> 24:50.900
 And the theory of close calls says that people

24:50.900 --> 24:55.820
 typically miscategorize the events in their life

24:55.820 --> 24:57.820
 where something almost went wrong.

24:58.940 --> 25:01.060
 And, you know, for example, if you,

25:01.060 --> 25:04.740
 I have a friend who, I was walking down the street

25:04.740 --> 25:06.740
 with my college friends and one of my friends

25:06.740 --> 25:08.700
 stepped into the street thinking it was clear

25:08.700 --> 25:12.060
 and was nearly hit by a car going 45 miles an hour,

25:12.060 --> 25:14.940
 would have been an absolute disaster, might have killed her,

25:14.940 --> 25:17.340
 certainly would have permanently injured her.

25:18.500 --> 25:21.700
 But she didn't, you know, car didn't touch her, right?

25:21.700 --> 25:25.220
 Now you could walk away from that and think nothing of it

25:25.220 --> 25:26.660
 because, well, what is there to think?

25:26.660 --> 25:28.220
 Nothing happened.

25:28.220 --> 25:30.660
 Or you could think, well, what is the difference

25:30.660 --> 25:33.540
 between what did happen and my death?

25:33.540 --> 25:35.100
 The difference is luck.

25:35.100 --> 25:37.340
 I never want that to be true, right?

25:37.340 --> 25:40.020
 I never want the difference between what did happen

25:40.020 --> 25:41.620
 and my death to be luck.

25:41.620 --> 25:45.260
 Therefore, I should count this as very close to death

25:45.260 --> 25:47.620
 and I should prioritize coding

25:47.620 --> 25:50.420
 so it doesn't happen again at a very high level.

25:50.420 --> 25:52.460
 So anyway, my basic point is

25:53.820 --> 25:58.700
 the accidents and disasters and misfortune

25:58.700 --> 26:02.180
 describe a distribution that tells you

26:02.180 --> 26:04.420
 what's really likely to get you in the end.

26:04.420 --> 26:09.420
 And so personally, you can use them to figure out

26:10.020 --> 26:12.020
 where the dangers are so that you can afford

26:12.020 --> 26:14.380
 to take great risks because you have a really good sense

26:14.380 --> 26:15.780
 of how they're gonna go wrong.

26:15.780 --> 26:19.060
 But I would also point out civilization has this problem.

26:19.060 --> 26:22.900
 Civilization is now producing these events

26:22.900 --> 26:24.420
 that are major disasters,

26:24.420 --> 26:27.500
 but they're not existential scale yet, right?

26:27.500 --> 26:30.100
 They're very serious errors that we can see.

26:30.100 --> 26:32.140
 And I would argue that the pattern is

26:32.140 --> 26:35.140
 you discover that we are involved in some industrial process

26:35.140 --> 26:37.900
 at the point it has gone wrong, right?

26:37.900 --> 26:40.780
 So I'm now always asking the question,

26:40.780 --> 26:44.860
 okay, in light of the Fukushima triple meltdown,

26:44.860 --> 26:46.980
 the financial collapse of 2008,

26:46.980 --> 26:51.660
 the Deepwater Horizon blowout, COVID 19,

26:51.660 --> 26:55.340
 and its probable origins in the Wuhan lab,

26:55.340 --> 26:58.820
 what processes do I not know the name of yet

26:58.820 --> 27:00.460
 that I will discover at the point

27:00.460 --> 27:03.060
 that some gigantic accident has happened?

27:03.060 --> 27:06.180
 And can we talk about the wisdom or lack thereof

27:06.180 --> 27:09.060
 of engaging in that process before the accident, right?

27:09.060 --> 27:11.460
 That's what a wise civilization would be doing.

27:11.460 --> 27:12.900
 And yet we don't.

27:12.900 --> 27:15.100
 I just wanna mention something that happened

27:15.100 --> 27:17.140
 a couple of days ago.

27:17.140 --> 27:20.020
 I don't know if you know who JB Straubel is.

27:20.020 --> 27:21.780
 He's the co founder of Tesla,

27:21.780 --> 27:24.060
 CTO of Tesla for many, many years.

27:24.060 --> 27:26.340
 His wife just died.

27:26.340 --> 27:28.580
 She was riding a bicycle.

27:28.580 --> 27:33.580
 And in the same thin line between death and life

27:35.260 --> 27:37.460
 that many of us have been in,

27:37.460 --> 27:39.540
 where you walk into the intersection

27:39.540 --> 27:41.820
 and there's this close call.

27:41.820 --> 27:46.820
 Every once in a while, you get the short straw.

27:50.900 --> 27:54.980
 I wonder how much of our own individual lives

27:54.980 --> 27:57.540
 and the entirety of the human civilization

27:57.540 --> 27:59.780
 rests on this little roll of the dice.

28:00.860 --> 28:03.300
 Well, this is sort of my point about the close calls

28:03.300 --> 28:06.780
 is that there's a level at which we can't control it, right?

28:06.780 --> 28:11.100
 The gigantic asteroid that comes from deep space

28:11.100 --> 28:13.060
 that you don't have time to do anything about.

28:13.060 --> 28:15.620
 There's not a lot we can do to hedge that out,

28:15.620 --> 28:16.940
 or at least not short term.

28:17.900 --> 28:20.420
 But there are lots of other things.

28:20.420 --> 28:23.780
 Obviously, the financial collapse of 2008

28:23.780 --> 28:27.060
 didn't break down the entire world economy.

28:27.060 --> 28:28.900
 It threatened to, but a Herculean effort

28:28.900 --> 28:31.100
 managed to pull us back from the brink.

28:31.100 --> 28:34.380
 The triple meltdown at Fukushima was awful,

28:34.380 --> 28:37.380
 but every one of the seven fuel pools held,

28:37.380 --> 28:39.580
 there wasn't a major fire that made it impossible

28:39.580 --> 28:41.660
 to manage the disaster going forward.

28:41.660 --> 28:42.660
 We got lucky.

28:44.620 --> 28:47.820
 We could say the same thing about the blowout

28:47.820 --> 28:49.580
 at the Deepwater Horizon,

28:49.580 --> 28:52.460
 where a hole in the ocean floor large enough

28:52.460 --> 28:54.340
 that we couldn't have plugged it, could have opened up.

28:54.340 --> 28:57.500
 All of these things could have been much, much worse, right?

28:57.500 --> 28:59.140
 And I think we can say the same thing about COVID,

28:59.140 --> 29:00.980
 as terrible as it is.

29:00.980 --> 29:04.740
 And we cannot say for sure that it came from the Wuhan lab,

29:04.740 --> 29:06.980
 but there's a strong likelihood that it did.

29:06.980 --> 29:10.300
 And it also could be much, much worse.

29:10.300 --> 29:13.820
 So in each of these cases, something is telling us,

29:13.820 --> 29:16.340
 we have a process that is unfolding

29:16.340 --> 29:18.600
 that keeps creating risks where it is luck

29:18.600 --> 29:19.900
 that is the difference between us

29:19.900 --> 29:22.700
 and some scale of disaster that is unimaginable.

29:22.700 --> 29:26.700
 And that wisdom, you can be highly intelligent

29:26.700 --> 29:28.900
 and cause these disasters.

29:28.900 --> 29:31.780
 To be wise is to stop causing them, right?

29:31.780 --> 29:36.580
 And that would require a process of restraint,

29:36.580 --> 29:38.880
 a process that I don't see a lot of evidence of yet.

29:38.880 --> 29:41.880
 So I think we have to generate it.

29:41.880 --> 29:45.540
 And somehow, at the moment,

29:45.540 --> 29:47.460
 we don't have a political structure

29:47.460 --> 29:51.540
 that would be capable of taking

29:51.540 --> 29:55.740
 a protective algorithm and actually deploying it, right?

29:55.740 --> 29:57.780
 Because it would have important economic consequences.

29:57.780 --> 30:00.380
 And so it would almost certainly be shot down.

30:00.380 --> 30:03.380
 But we can obviously also say,

30:03.380 --> 30:07.020
 we paid a huge price for all of the disasters

30:07.020 --> 30:09.360
 that I've mentioned.

30:09.360 --> 30:12.060
 And we have to factor that into the equation.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.840
 Something can be very productive short term

30:13.840 --> 30:15.380
 and very destructive long term.

30:17.100 --> 30:20.900
 Also, the question is how many disasters we avoided

30:20.900 --> 30:23.980
 because of the ingenuity of humans

30:23.980 --> 30:26.760
 or just the integrity and character of humans.

30:28.020 --> 30:30.260
 That's sort of an open question.

30:30.260 --> 30:35.260
 We may be more intelligent than lucky.

30:35.800 --> 30:36.900
 That's the hope.

30:36.900 --> 30:40.060
 Because the optimistic message here that you're getting at

30:40.060 --> 30:43.720
 is maybe the process that we should be,

30:44.980 --> 30:48.520
 that maybe we can overcome luck with ingenuity.

30:48.520 --> 30:51.940
 Meaning, I guess you're suggesting the processes

30:51.940 --> 30:53.700
 we should be listing all the ways

30:53.700 --> 30:55.860
 that human civilization can destroy itself,

30:57.100 --> 30:58.980
 assigning likelihood to it,

30:59.940 --> 31:03.180
 and thinking through how can we avoid that.

31:03.180 --> 31:06.700
 And being very honest with the data out there

31:06.700 --> 31:10.500
 about the close calls and using those close calls

31:10.500 --> 31:13.900
 to then create sort of mechanism

31:13.900 --> 31:17.420
 by which we minimize the probability of those close calls.

31:17.420 --> 31:21.220
 And just being honest and transparent

31:21.220 --> 31:23.140
 with the data that's out there.

31:23.140 --> 31:26.220
 Well, I think we need to do a couple things for it to work.

31:27.640 --> 31:30.060
 So I've been an advocate for the idea

31:30.060 --> 31:32.060
 that sustainability is actually,

31:32.060 --> 31:33.660
 it's difficult to operationalize,

31:33.660 --> 31:35.900
 but it is an objective that we have to meet

31:35.900 --> 31:38.540
 if we're to be around long term.

31:38.540 --> 31:41.460
 And I realized that we also need to have reversibility

31:41.460 --> 31:43.300
 of all of our processes.

31:43.300 --> 31:46.320
 Because processes very frequently when they start

31:46.320 --> 31:47.940
 do not appear dangerous.

31:47.940 --> 31:51.260
 And then when they scale, they become very dangerous.

31:51.260 --> 31:53.160
 So for example, if you imagine

31:54.280 --> 31:58.300
 the first internal combustion engine vehicle

31:58.300 --> 31:59.680
 driving down the street,

31:59.680 --> 32:01.740
 and you imagine somebody running after them saying,

32:01.740 --> 32:02.980
 hey, if you do enough of that,

32:02.980 --> 32:04.280
 you're gonna alter the atmosphere

32:04.280 --> 32:05.960
 and it's gonna change the temperature of the planet.

32:05.960 --> 32:07.420
 It's preposterous, right?

32:07.420 --> 32:08.580
 Why would you stop the person

32:08.580 --> 32:10.900
 who's invented this marvelous new contraption?

32:10.900 --> 32:13.140
 But of course, eventually you do get to the place

32:13.140 --> 32:14.620
 where you're doing enough of this

32:14.620 --> 32:17.060
 that you do start changing the temperature of the planet.

32:17.060 --> 32:20.460
 So if we built the capacity,

32:20.460 --> 32:23.780
 if we basically said, look, you can't involve yourself

32:23.780 --> 32:27.540
 in any process that you couldn't reverse if you had to,

32:27.540 --> 32:30.180
 then progress would be slowed,

32:30.180 --> 32:33.300
 but our safety would go up dramatically.

32:33.300 --> 32:38.120
 And I think in some sense, if we are to be around long term,

32:38.120 --> 32:40.300
 we have to begin thinking that way.

32:40.300 --> 32:43.880
 We're just involved in too many very dangerous processes.

32:43.880 --> 32:46.860
 So let's talk about one of the things

32:46.860 --> 32:50.300
 that if not threatened human civilization

32:50.300 --> 32:54.940
 certainly hurt it at a deep level, which is COVID 19.

32:56.700 --> 32:59.500
 What percent probability would you currently place

33:00.380 --> 33:02.500
 on the hypothesis that COVID 19 leaked

33:02.500 --> 33:06.300
 from the Wuhan Institute of Virology?

33:06.300 --> 33:10.780
 So I maintain a flow chart of all the possible explanations,

33:10.780 --> 33:14.280
 and it doesn't break down exactly that way.

33:15.300 --> 33:19.140
 The likelihood that it emerged from a lab is very, very high.

33:20.140 --> 33:21.380
 If it emerged from a lab,

33:21.380 --> 33:23.580
 the likelihood that the lab was the Wuhan Institute

33:23.580 --> 33:24.740
 is very, very high.

33:27.920 --> 33:30.500
 There are multiple different kinds of evidence

33:30.500 --> 33:31.660
 that point to the lab,

33:31.660 --> 33:35.060
 and there is literally no evidence that points to nature.

33:35.060 --> 33:38.180
 Either the evidence points nowhere or it points to the lab,

33:38.180 --> 33:39.900
 and the lab could mean any lab,

33:39.900 --> 33:41.900
 but geographically, obviously,

33:41.900 --> 33:44.920
 the labs in Wuhan are the most likely,

33:44.920 --> 33:46.720
 and the lab that was most directly involved

33:46.720 --> 33:50.340
 with research on viruses that look like COVID,

33:50.340 --> 33:52.200
 that look like SARS COVID 2,

33:52.200 --> 33:55.820
 is obviously the place that one would start.

33:55.820 --> 33:59.640
 But I would say the likelihood that this virus

33:59.640 --> 34:04.100
 came from a lab is well above 95%.

34:04.100 --> 34:06.740
 We can talk about the question of could a virus

34:06.740 --> 34:08.740
 have been brought into the lab and escaped from there

34:08.740 --> 34:09.900
 without being modified.

34:09.900 --> 34:11.220
 That's also possible,

34:11.220 --> 34:13.700
 but it doesn't explain any of the anomalies

34:13.700 --> 34:16.520
 in the genome of SARS COVID 2.

34:17.960 --> 34:20.680
 Could it have been delivered from another lab?

34:20.680 --> 34:23.140
 Could Wuhan be a distraction

34:23.140 --> 34:26.600
 in order that we would connect the dots in the wrong way?

34:26.600 --> 34:27.620
 That's conceivable.

34:27.620 --> 34:30.620
 I currently have that below 1% on my flowchart,

34:30.620 --> 34:31.440
 but I think...

34:31.440 --> 34:34.180
 A very dark thought that somebody would do that

34:34.180 --> 34:37.740
 almost as a political attack on China.

34:37.740 --> 34:39.100
 Well, it depends.

34:39.100 --> 34:42.380
 I don't even think that's one possibility.

34:42.380 --> 34:44.460
 Sometimes when Eric and I talk about these issues,

34:44.460 --> 34:48.260
 we will generate a scenario just to prove

34:48.260 --> 34:51.060
 that something could live in that space, right?

34:51.060 --> 34:53.820
 It's a placeholder for whatever may actually have happened.

34:53.820 --> 34:57.300
 And so it doesn't have to have been an attack on China.

34:57.300 --> 34:59.280
 That's certainly one possibility.

34:59.280 --> 35:00.700
 But I would point out,

35:01.740 --> 35:06.740
 if you can predict the future in some unusual way

35:06.740 --> 35:10.260
 better than others, you can print money, right?

35:10.260 --> 35:12.380
 That's what markets that allow you to bet for

35:12.380 --> 35:16.980
 or against virtually any sector allow you to do.

35:16.980 --> 35:21.980
 So you can imagine a simply amoral person

35:23.260 --> 35:26.380
 or entity generating a pandemic,

35:26.380 --> 35:28.260
 attempting to cover their tracks

35:28.260 --> 35:30.520
 because it would allow them to bet against things

35:30.520 --> 35:35.100
 like cruise ships, air travel, whatever it is,

35:35.100 --> 35:37.860
 and bet in favor of, I don't know,

35:39.540 --> 35:43.300
 sanitizing gel and whatever else you would do.

35:43.300 --> 35:46.400
 So am I saying that I think somebody did that?

35:46.400 --> 35:47.740
 No, I really don't think it happened.

35:47.740 --> 35:49.020
 We've seen zero evidence

35:49.020 --> 35:51.340
 that this was intentionally released.

35:51.340 --> 35:54.780
 However, were it to have been intentionally released

35:54.780 --> 35:56.180
 by somebody who did not know,

35:56.180 --> 35:59.260
 did not want it known where it had come from,

35:59.260 --> 36:00.980
 releasing it into Wuhan would be one way

36:00.980 --> 36:01.860
 to cover their tracks.

36:01.860 --> 36:05.140
 So we have to leave the possibility formally open,

36:05.140 --> 36:07.420
 but acknowledge there's no evidence.

36:07.420 --> 36:09.340
 And the probability therefore is low.

36:09.340 --> 36:13.740
 I tend to believe maybe this is the optimistic nature

36:13.740 --> 36:18.480
 that I have that people who are competent enough

36:18.480 --> 36:20.660
 to do the kind of thing we just described

36:21.740 --> 36:23.100
 are not going to do that

36:23.100 --> 36:26.220
 because it requires a certain kind of,

36:26.220 --> 36:27.420
 I don't wanna use the word evil,

36:27.420 --> 36:29.260
 but whatever word you wanna use to describe

36:29.260 --> 36:34.260
 the kind of disregard for human life required to do that,

36:36.860 --> 36:40.540
 that's just not going to be coupled with competence.

36:40.540 --> 36:42.460
 I feel like there's a trade off chart

36:42.460 --> 36:45.940
 where competence on one axis and evil is on the other.

36:45.940 --> 36:47.500
 And the more evil you become,

36:48.540 --> 36:52.720
 the crappier you are at doing great engineering,

36:52.720 --> 36:55.740
 scientific work required to deliver weapons

36:55.740 --> 36:57.820
 of different kinds, whether it's bioweapons

36:57.820 --> 36:59.860
 or nuclear weapons, all those kinds of things.

36:59.860 --> 37:02.700
 That seems to be the lessons I take from history,

37:02.700 --> 37:04.380
 but that doesn't necessarily mean

37:04.380 --> 37:06.980
 that's what's going to be happening in the future.

37:08.140 --> 37:11.300
 But to stick on the lab leak idea,

37:11.300 --> 37:13.580
 because the flow chart is probably huge here

37:13.580 --> 37:16.220
 because there's a lot of fascinating possibilities.

37:16.220 --> 37:18.100
 One question I wanna ask is,

37:18.100 --> 37:20.780
 what would evidence for natural origins look like?

37:20.780 --> 37:25.220
 So one piece of evidence for natural origins

37:25.220 --> 37:28.740
 is that it's happened in the past

37:30.100 --> 37:33.580
 that viruses have jumped.

37:33.580 --> 37:35.060
 Oh, they do jump.

37:35.060 --> 37:38.540
 So like that's possible to have happened.

37:39.900 --> 37:42.280
 So that's a sort of like a historical evidence,

37:42.280 --> 37:46.220
 like, okay, well, it's possible that it have...

37:46.220 --> 37:48.100
 It's not evidence of the kind you think it is.

37:48.100 --> 37:52.260
 It's a justification for a presumption, right?

37:52.260 --> 37:54.180
 So the presumption upon discovering

37:54.180 --> 37:55.740
 a new virus circulating is certainly

37:55.740 --> 37:57.860
 that it came from nature, right?

37:57.860 --> 38:00.680
 The problem is the presumption evaporates

38:00.680 --> 38:04.140
 in the face of evidence, or at least it logically should.

38:04.140 --> 38:05.760
 And it didn't in this case.

38:05.760 --> 38:08.260
 It was maintained by people who privately

38:08.260 --> 38:11.760
 in their emails acknowledged that they had grave doubts

38:11.760 --> 38:14.820
 about the natural origin of this virus.

38:14.820 --> 38:17.020
 Is there some other piece of evidence

38:17.020 --> 38:21.780
 that we could look for and see that would say,

38:21.780 --> 38:24.740
 this increases the probability that it's natural origins?

38:24.740 --> 38:27.620
 Yeah, in fact, there is evidence.

38:27.620 --> 38:31.460
 I always worry that somebody is going to make up

38:31.460 --> 38:34.540
 some evidence in order to reverse the flow.

38:34.540 --> 38:35.380
 Oh, boy.

38:35.380 --> 38:36.580
 Well, let's say I am...

38:36.580 --> 38:38.180
 There's a lot of incentive for that actually.

38:38.180 --> 38:39.540
 There's a huge amount of incentive.

38:39.540 --> 38:43.460
 On the other hand, why didn't the powers that be,

38:43.460 --> 38:45.140
 the powers that lied to us about weapons

38:45.140 --> 38:46.340
 of mass destruction in Iraq,

38:46.340 --> 38:48.140
 why didn't they ever fake weapons

38:48.140 --> 38:49.740
 of mass destruction in Iraq?

38:49.740 --> 38:52.660
 Whatever force it is, I hope that force is here too.

38:52.660 --> 38:54.940
 And so whatever evidence we find is real.

38:54.940 --> 38:56.820
 It's the competence thing I'm talking about,

38:56.820 --> 38:58.900
 but okay, go ahead, sorry.

38:58.900 --> 39:00.180
 Well, we can get back to that.

39:00.180 --> 39:03.860
 But I would say, yeah, the giant piece of evidence

39:03.860 --> 39:07.120
 that will shift the probabilities in the other direction

39:07.120 --> 39:10.500
 is the discovery of either a human population

39:10.500 --> 39:14.280
 in which the virus circulated prior to showing up in Wuhan

39:14.280 --> 39:16.920
 that would explain where the virus learned all of the tricks

39:16.920 --> 39:20.340
 that it knew instantly upon spreading from Wuhan.

39:20.340 --> 39:24.060
 So that would do it, or an animal population

39:24.060 --> 39:27.860
 in which an ancestor epidemic can be found

39:27.860 --> 39:30.600
 in which the virus learned this before jumping to humans.

39:30.600 --> 39:33.460
 But I point out in that second case,

39:33.460 --> 39:36.600
 you would certainly expect to see a great deal of evolution

39:36.600 --> 39:39.700
 in the early epidemic, which we don't see.

39:39.700 --> 39:42.860
 So there almost has to be a human population

39:42.860 --> 39:44.980
 somewhere else that had the virus circulate

39:44.980 --> 39:47.580
 or an ancestor of the virus that we first saw

39:47.580 --> 39:48.620
 in Wuhan circulating.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.940
 And it has to have gotten very sophisticated

39:50.940 --> 39:54.020
 in that prior epidemic before hitting Wuhan

39:54.020 --> 39:56.380
 in order to explain the total lack of evolution

39:56.380 --> 40:00.120
 and extremely effective virus that emerged

40:00.120 --> 40:01.660
 at the end of 2019.

40:01.660 --> 40:03.680
 So you don't believe in the magic of evolution

40:03.680 --> 40:05.660
 to spring up with all the tricks already there?

40:05.660 --> 40:07.460
 Like everybody who doesn't have the tricks,

40:07.460 --> 40:09.420
 they die quickly.

40:09.420 --> 40:11.500
 And then you just have this beautiful virus

40:11.500 --> 40:13.420
 that comes in with a spike protein

40:13.420 --> 40:17.180
 and through mutation and selection,

40:17.180 --> 40:22.180
 just like the ones that succeed and succeed big

40:23.660 --> 40:25.780
 are the ones that are going to just spring into life

40:25.780 --> 40:26.780
 with the tricks.

40:26.780 --> 40:30.580
 Well, no, that's called a hopeful monster.

40:30.580 --> 40:33.180
 And hopeful monsters don't work.

40:33.180 --> 40:37.700
 The job of becoming a new pandemic virus is too difficult.

40:37.700 --> 40:39.340
 It involves two very difficult steps

40:39.340 --> 40:40.340
 and they both have to work.

40:40.340 --> 40:43.420
 One is the ability to infect a person and spread

40:43.420 --> 40:46.780
 in their tissues sufficient to make an infection.

40:46.780 --> 40:49.140
 And the other is to jump between individuals

40:49.140 --> 40:51.540
 at a sufficient rate that it doesn't go extinct

40:51.540 --> 40:53.340
 for one reason or another.

40:53.340 --> 40:55.180
 Those are both very difficult jobs.

40:55.180 --> 40:58.060
 They require, as you describe, selection.

40:58.060 --> 41:00.700
 And the point is selection would leave a mark.

41:00.700 --> 41:02.220
 We would see evidence that it would stay.

41:02.220 --> 41:04.100
 In animals or humans, we would see.

41:04.100 --> 41:05.820
 Both, right?

41:05.820 --> 41:09.380
 And we see this evolutionary trace of the virus

41:09.380 --> 41:10.700
 gathering the tricks up.

41:10.700 --> 41:12.300
 Yeah, you would see the virus,

41:12.300 --> 41:14.180
 you would see the clumsy virus get better and better.

41:14.180 --> 41:17.180
 And yes, I am a full believer in the power of that process.

41:17.180 --> 41:18.420
 In fact, I believe it.

41:19.300 --> 41:22.420
 What I know from studying the process

41:22.420 --> 41:25.300
 is that it is much more powerful than most people imagine.

41:25.300 --> 41:28.900
 That what we teach in the Evolution 101 textbook

41:28.900 --> 41:32.100
 is too clumsy a process to do what we see it doing

41:32.100 --> 41:35.220
 and that actually people should increase their expectation

41:35.220 --> 41:39.780
 of the rapidity with which that process can produce

41:39.780 --> 41:42.620
 just jaw dropping adaptations.

41:42.620 --> 41:45.020
 That said, we just don't see evidence that it happened here

41:45.020 --> 41:46.620
 which doesn't mean it doesn't exist,

41:46.620 --> 41:49.340
 but it means in spite of immense pressure

41:49.340 --> 41:51.980
 to find it somewhere, there's been no hint

41:51.980 --> 41:55.540
 which probably means it took place inside of a laboratory.

41:55.540 --> 41:58.220
 So inside the laboratory,

41:58.220 --> 42:00.900
 gain of function research on viruses.

42:00.900 --> 42:04.900
 And I believe most of that kind of research

42:04.900 --> 42:07.100
 is doing this exact thing that you're referring to

42:07.100 --> 42:09.420
 which is accelerated evolution

42:09.420 --> 42:11.180
 and just watching evolution do its thing

42:11.180 --> 42:12.580
 and a bunch of viruses

42:12.580 --> 42:16.140
 and seeing what kind of tricks get developed.

42:16.140 --> 42:21.140
 The other method is engineering viruses.

42:21.340 --> 42:24.460
 So manually adding on the tricks.

42:26.380 --> 42:30.940
 Which do you think we should be thinking about here?

42:30.940 --> 42:33.620
 So mind you, I learned what I know

42:33.620 --> 42:35.980
 in the aftermath of this pandemic emerging.

42:35.980 --> 42:39.100
 I started studying the question and I would say

42:39.100 --> 42:43.700
 based on the content of the genome and other evidence

42:43.700 --> 42:45.660
 in publications from the various labs

42:45.660 --> 42:50.380
 that were involved in generating this technology,

42:50.380 --> 42:52.460
 a couple of things seem likely.

42:52.460 --> 42:57.460
 This SARS CoV2 does not appear to be entirely the result

42:57.740 --> 43:02.740
 of either a splicing process or serial passaging.

43:02.740 --> 43:07.300
 It appears to have both things in its past

43:07.300 --> 43:09.300
 or it's at least highly likely that it does.

43:09.300 --> 43:11.820
 So for example, the fern cleavage site

43:11.820 --> 43:15.620
 looks very much like it was added in to the virus

43:15.620 --> 43:18.620
 and it was known that that would increase its infectivity

43:18.620 --> 43:21.220
 in humans and increase its tropism.

43:22.140 --> 43:27.140
 The virus appears to be excellent

43:27.140 --> 43:32.140
 at spreading in humans and minks and ferrets.

43:32.220 --> 43:34.420
 Now minks and ferrets are very closely related to each other

43:34.420 --> 43:36.660
 and ferrets are very likely to have been used

43:36.660 --> 43:38.580
 in a serial passage experiment.

43:38.580 --> 43:41.340
 The reason being that they have an ACE2 receptor

43:41.340 --> 43:43.780
 that looks very much like the human ACE2 receptor.

43:43.780 --> 43:46.940
 And so were you going to passage the virus

43:46.940 --> 43:49.260
 or its ancestor through an animal

43:49.260 --> 43:51.620
 in order to increase its infectivity in humans,

43:51.620 --> 43:53.940
 which would have been necessary,

43:53.940 --> 43:55.620
 ferrets would have been very likely.

43:55.620 --> 43:57.300
 It is also quite likely

43:57.300 --> 44:01.420
 that humanized mice were utilized

44:01.420 --> 44:05.700
 and it is possible that human airway tissue was utilized.

44:05.700 --> 44:07.940
 I think it is vital that we find out

44:07.940 --> 44:09.100
 what the protocols were.

44:09.100 --> 44:11.380
 If this came from the Wuhan Institute,

44:11.380 --> 44:12.220
 we need to know it

44:12.220 --> 44:14.940
 and we need to know what the protocols were exactly

44:14.940 --> 44:17.260
 because they will actually give us some tools

44:17.260 --> 44:20.900
 that would be useful in fighting SARS CoV2

44:20.900 --> 44:22.500
 and hopefully driving it to extinction,

44:22.500 --> 44:24.420
 which ought to be our priority.

44:24.420 --> 44:26.180
 It is a priority that does not,

44:26.180 --> 44:28.220
 it is not apparent from our behavior,

44:28.220 --> 44:31.300
 but it really is, it should be our objective.

44:31.300 --> 44:33.420
 If we understood where our interests lie,

44:33.420 --> 44:35.700
 we would be much more focused on it.

44:36.580 --> 44:39.340
 But those protocols would tell us a great deal.

44:39.340 --> 44:42.140
 If it wasn't the Wuhan Institute, we need to know that.

44:42.140 --> 44:44.420
 If it was nature, we need to know that.

44:44.420 --> 44:45.860
 And if it was some other laboratory,

44:45.860 --> 44:48.500
 we need to figure out what and where

44:48.500 --> 44:51.340
 so that we can determine what we can determine

44:51.340 --> 44:53.060
 about what was done.

44:53.060 --> 44:57.340
 You're opening up my mind about why we should investigate,

44:57.340 --> 45:01.340
 why we should know the truth of the origins of this virus.

45:01.340 --> 45:03.060
 So for me personally,

45:03.060 --> 45:05.980
 let me just tell the story of my own kind of journey.

45:07.420 --> 45:11.460
 When I first started looking into the lab leak hypothesis,

45:12.820 --> 45:15.060
 what became terrifying to me

45:15.060 --> 45:19.100
 and important to understand and obvious

45:19.100 --> 45:22.300
 is the sort of like Sam Harris way of thinking,

45:22.300 --> 45:27.020
 which is it's obvious that a lab leak of a deadly virus

45:27.020 --> 45:28.260
 will eventually happen.

45:29.460 --> 45:32.580
 My mind was, it doesn't even matter

45:32.580 --> 45:34.540
 if it happened in this case.

45:34.540 --> 45:37.460
 It's obvious that it's going to happen in the future.

45:37.460 --> 45:40.620
 So why the hell are we not freaking out about this?

45:40.620 --> 45:42.540
 And COVID 19 is not even that deadly

45:42.540 --> 45:45.100
 relative to the possible future viruses.

45:45.100 --> 45:47.660
 It's this, the way I disagree with Sam on this,

45:47.660 --> 45:50.620
 but he thinks about this way about AGI as well,

45:50.620 --> 45:52.380
 not about artificial intelligence.

45:52.380 --> 45:54.100
 It's a different discussion, I think,

45:54.100 --> 45:56.540
 but with viruses, it seems like something that could happen

45:56.540 --> 46:00.060
 on the scale of years, maybe a few decades.

46:00.060 --> 46:02.380
 AGI is a little bit farther out for me,

46:02.380 --> 46:04.220
 but it seemed, the terrifying thing,

46:04.220 --> 46:08.460
 it seemed obvious that this will happen very soon

46:08.460 --> 46:11.700
 for a much deadlier virus as we get better and better

46:11.700 --> 46:13.780
 at both engineering viruses

46:13.780 --> 46:16.660
 and doing this kind of evolutionary driven research,

46:16.660 --> 46:18.620
 gain of function research.

46:18.620 --> 46:23.100
 Okay, but then you started speaking out about this as well,

46:23.100 --> 46:25.260
 but also started to say, no, no, no,

46:25.260 --> 46:27.780
 we should hurry up and figure out the origins now

46:27.780 --> 46:29.780
 because it will help us figure out

46:29.780 --> 46:34.780
 how to actually respond to this particular virus,

46:35.500 --> 46:37.660
 how to treat this particular virus.

46:37.660 --> 46:40.460
 What is in terms of vaccines, in terms of antiviral drugs,

46:40.460 --> 46:45.460
 in terms of just all the number of responses

46:45.820 --> 46:46.660
 that we should have.

46:46.660 --> 46:51.660
 Okay, I still am much more freaking out about the future.

46:53.900 --> 46:57.620
 Maybe you can break that apart a little bit.

46:57.620 --> 47:02.620
 Which are you most focused on now?

47:03.940 --> 47:06.900
 Which are you most freaking out about now

47:06.900 --> 47:08.620
 in terms of the importance of figuring out

47:08.620 --> 47:10.620
 the origins of this virus?

47:10.620 --> 47:13.660
 I am most freaking out about both of them

47:13.660 --> 47:15.380
 because they're both really important

47:15.380 --> 47:18.100
 and we can put bounds on this.

47:18.100 --> 47:20.900
 Let me say first that this is a perfect test case

47:20.900 --> 47:22.460
 for the theory of close calls

47:22.460 --> 47:25.260
 because as much as COVID is a disaster,

47:25.260 --> 47:28.500
 it is also a close call from which we can learn much.

47:28.500 --> 47:29.700
 You are absolutely right.

47:29.700 --> 47:32.140
 If we keep playing this game in the lab,

47:32.140 --> 47:34.820
 if we are not, if we are,

47:34.820 --> 47:36.540
 especially if we do it under pressure

47:36.540 --> 47:37.860
 and when we are told that a virus

47:37.860 --> 47:40.100
 is going to leap from nature any day

47:40.100 --> 47:41.300
 and that the more we know,

47:41.300 --> 47:42.540
 the better we'll be able to fight it,

47:42.540 --> 47:44.620
 we're gonna create the disaster,

47:44.620 --> 47:46.540
 all the sooner.

47:46.540 --> 47:49.460
 So yes, that should be an absolute focus.

47:49.460 --> 47:50.940
 The fact that there were people saying

47:50.940 --> 47:54.420
 that this was dangerous back in 2015

47:54.420 --> 47:55.460
 ought to tell us something.

47:55.460 --> 47:57.780
 The fact that the system bypassed a ban

47:57.780 --> 48:00.140
 and offshored the work to China

48:00.140 --> 48:02.180
 ought to tell us this is not a Chinese failure.

48:02.180 --> 48:05.820
 This is a failure of something larger and harder to see.

48:07.020 --> 48:11.620
 But I also think that there's a clock ticking

48:11.620 --> 48:14.780
 with respect to SARS CoV2 and COVID,

48:14.780 --> 48:16.940
 the disease that it creates.

48:16.940 --> 48:18.340
 And that has to do with whether or not

48:18.340 --> 48:20.980
 we are stuck with it permanently.

48:20.980 --> 48:22.980
 So if you think about the cost to humanity

48:22.980 --> 48:24.940
 of being stuck with influenza,

48:24.940 --> 48:27.220
 it's an immense cost year after year.

48:27.220 --> 48:30.300
 And we just stop thinking about it because it's there.

48:30.300 --> 48:32.460
 Some years you get the flu, most years you don't.

48:32.460 --> 48:34.220
 Maybe you get the vaccine to prevent it.

48:34.220 --> 48:37.180
 Maybe the vaccine isn't particularly well targeted.

48:37.180 --> 48:40.260
 But imagine just simply doubling that cost.

48:40.260 --> 48:44.020
 Imagine we get stuck with SARS CoV2

48:44.020 --> 48:45.980
 and its descendants going forward

48:45.980 --> 48:48.300
 and that it just settles in

48:48.300 --> 48:51.340
 and becomes a fact of modern human life.

48:51.340 --> 48:52.860
 That would be a disaster, right?

48:52.860 --> 48:54.660
 The number of people we will ultimately lose

48:54.660 --> 48:55.980
 is incalculable.

48:55.980 --> 48:58.340
 The amount of suffering that will be caused is incalculable.

48:58.340 --> 49:01.980
 The loss of wellbeing and wealth, incalculable.

49:01.980 --> 49:04.660
 So that ought to be a very high priority,

49:04.660 --> 49:08.100
 driving this extinct before it becomes permanent.

49:08.100 --> 49:12.020
 And the ability to drive extinct goes down

49:12.020 --> 49:15.660
 the longer we delay effective responses.

49:15.660 --> 49:18.900
 To the extent that we let it have this very large canvas,

49:18.900 --> 49:21.580
 large numbers of people who have the disease

49:21.580 --> 49:25.060
 in which mutation and selection can result in adaptation

49:25.060 --> 49:26.980
 that we will not be able to counter

49:26.980 --> 49:29.540
 the greater its ability to figure out features

49:29.540 --> 49:33.660
 of our immune system and use them to its advantage.

49:33.660 --> 49:37.340
 So I'm feeling the pressure of driving it extinct.

49:37.340 --> 49:40.460
 I believe we could have driven it extinct six months ago

49:40.460 --> 49:43.420
 and we didn't do it because of very mundane concerns

49:43.420 --> 49:44.860
 among a small number of people.

49:44.860 --> 49:49.860
 And I'm not alleging that they were brazen about

49:52.140 --> 49:55.220
 or that they were callous about deaths that would be caused.

49:55.220 --> 49:56.660
 I have the sense that they were working

49:56.660 --> 50:00.380
 from a kind of autopilot in which you,

50:00.380 --> 50:02.700
 let's say you're in some kind of a corporation,

50:02.700 --> 50:04.420
 a pharmaceutical corporation,

50:04.420 --> 50:08.500
 you have a portfolio of therapies

50:08.500 --> 50:11.540
 that in the context of a pandemic might be very lucrative.

50:11.540 --> 50:13.860
 Those therapies have competitors.

50:13.860 --> 50:15.780
 You of course wanna position your product

50:15.780 --> 50:18.940
 so that it succeeds and the competitors don't.

50:18.940 --> 50:22.220
 And lo and behold, at some point through means

50:22.220 --> 50:23.820
 that I think those of us on the outside

50:23.820 --> 50:28.580
 can't really intuit, you end up saying things

50:28.580 --> 50:30.940
 about competing therapies that work better

50:30.940 --> 50:33.940
 and much more safely than the ones you're selling

50:33.940 --> 50:36.460
 that aren't true and do cause people to die

50:36.460 --> 50:38.660
 in large numbers.

50:38.660 --> 50:43.180
 But it's some kind of autopilot, at least part of it is.

50:43.180 --> 50:47.460
 So there's a complicated coupling of the autopilot

50:47.460 --> 50:52.460
 of institutions, companies, governments.

50:53.540 --> 50:57.580
 And then there's also the geopolitical game theory thing

50:57.580 --> 51:00.500
 going on where you wanna keep secrets.

51:00.500 --> 51:03.900
 It's the Chernobyl thing where if you messed up,

51:04.860 --> 51:07.780
 there's a big incentive, I think,

51:07.780 --> 51:10.780
 to hide the fact that you messed up.

51:10.780 --> 51:12.740
 So how do we fix this?

51:12.740 --> 51:14.460
 And what's more important to fix?

51:14.460 --> 51:18.420
 The autopilot, which is the response

51:18.420 --> 51:21.980
 that we often criticize about our institutions,

51:21.980 --> 51:23.900
 especially the leaders in those institutions,

51:23.900 --> 51:25.860
 Anthony Fauci and so on,

51:25.860 --> 51:29.100
 some of the members of the scientific community.

51:29.100 --> 51:34.100
 And the second part is the game with China

51:35.180 --> 51:37.260
 of hiding the information

51:37.260 --> 51:39.460
 in terms of on the fight between nations.

51:40.300 --> 51:42.860
 Well, in our live streams on Dark Horse,

51:42.860 --> 51:44.860
 Heather and I have been talking from the beginning

51:44.860 --> 51:47.300
 about the fact that although, yes,

51:47.300 --> 51:50.020
 what happens began in China,

51:50.020 --> 51:51.540
 it very much looks like a failure

51:51.540 --> 51:53.820
 of the international scientific community.

51:54.700 --> 51:57.700
 That's frightening, but it's also hopeful

51:57.700 --> 52:01.020
 in the sense that actually if we did the right thing now,

52:01.020 --> 52:05.380
 we're not navigating a puzzle about Chinese responsibility.

52:05.380 --> 52:10.380
 We're navigating a question of collective responsibility

52:10.380 --> 52:14.140
 for something that has been terribly costly to all of us.

52:14.140 --> 52:17.980
 So that's not a very happy process.

52:17.980 --> 52:20.140
 But as you point out, what's at stake

52:20.140 --> 52:22.220
 is in large measure at the very least

52:22.220 --> 52:24.980
 the strong possibility this will happen again

52:24.980 --> 52:27.140
 and that at some point it will be far worse.

52:27.140 --> 52:32.140
 So just as a person that does not learn the lessons

52:32.300 --> 52:34.940
 of their own errors doesn't get smarter

52:34.940 --> 52:37.220
 and they remain in danger,

52:37.220 --> 52:40.020
 we collectively, humanity has to say,

52:40.020 --> 52:43.060
 well, there sure is a lot of evidence

52:43.060 --> 52:46.020
 that suggests that this is a self inflicted wound.

52:46.020 --> 52:47.860
 When you have done something

52:47.860 --> 52:51.260
 that has caused a massive self inflicted wound,

52:51.260 --> 52:55.340
 self inflicted wound, it makes sense to dwell on it

52:55.340 --> 52:57.660
 exactly to the point that you have learned the lesson

52:57.660 --> 52:59.620
 that makes it very, very unlikely

52:59.620 --> 53:01.820
 that something similar will happen again.

53:01.820 --> 53:04.380
 I think this is a good place to kind of ask you

53:04.380 --> 53:06.380
 to do almost like a thought experiment

53:07.500 --> 53:12.500
 or to steel man the argument against the lab leak hypothesis.

53:15.500 --> 53:20.500
 So if you were to argue, you said 95% chance

53:20.500 --> 53:25.500
 that the virus leak from a lab.

53:26.500 --> 53:29.940
 There's a bunch of ways I think you can argue

53:29.940 --> 53:34.940
 that even talking about it is bad for the world.

53:37.020 --> 53:40.140
 So if I just put something on the table,

53:40.140 --> 53:44.060
 it's to say that for one,

53:44.060 --> 53:46.780
 it would be racism versus Chinese people

53:46.780 --> 53:51.220
 that talking about that it leaked from a lab,

53:51.220 --> 53:53.620
 there's a kind of immediate kind of blame

53:53.620 --> 53:56.300
 and it can spiral down into this idea

53:56.300 --> 54:00.020
 that's somehow the people are responsible for the virus

54:00.020 --> 54:02.100
 and this kind of thing.

54:02.100 --> 54:03.340
 Is it possible for you to come up

54:03.340 --> 54:08.340
 with other steel man arguments against talking

54:08.860 --> 54:12.160
 or against the possibility of the lab leak hypothesis?

54:12.160 --> 54:16.760
 Well, so I think steel manning is a tool

54:16.760 --> 54:19.240
 that is extremely valuable,

54:19.240 --> 54:22.800
 but it's also possible to abuse it.

54:22.800 --> 54:26.440
 I think that you can only steel man a good faith argument.

54:26.440 --> 54:28.600
 And the problem is we now know

54:28.600 --> 54:31.280
 that we have not been engaged in opponents

54:31.280 --> 54:32.720
 who were wielding good faith arguments

54:32.720 --> 54:36.240
 because privately their emails reflect their own doubts.

54:36.240 --> 54:39.880
 And what they were doing publicly was actually a punishment,

54:39.880 --> 54:43.200
 a public punishment for those of us who spoke up

54:43.200 --> 54:46.960
 with I think the purpose of either backing us down

54:46.960 --> 54:49.120
 or more likely warning others

54:49.120 --> 54:51.280
 not to engage in the same kind of behavior.

54:51.280 --> 54:53.420
 And obviously for people like you and me

54:53.420 --> 54:58.420
 who regard science as our likely best hope

54:58.600 --> 55:01.440
 for navigating difficult waters,

55:01.440 --> 55:05.200
 shutting down people who are using those tools honorably

55:05.200 --> 55:07.540
 is itself dishonorable.

55:07.540 --> 55:12.540
 So I don't feel that there's anything to steel man.

55:13.840 --> 55:17.900
 And I also think that immediately at the point

55:17.900 --> 55:21.400
 that the world suddenly with no new evidence on the table

55:21.400 --> 55:24.160
 switched gears with respect to the lab leak,

55:24.160 --> 55:26.500
 at the point that Nicholas Wade had published his article

55:26.500 --> 55:28.480
 and suddenly the world was going to admit

55:28.480 --> 55:32.860
 that this was at least a possibility, if not a likelihood,

55:32.860 --> 55:36.560
 we got to see something of the rationalization process

55:36.560 --> 55:39.320
 that had taken place inside the institutional world.

55:39.320 --> 55:41.760
 And it very definitely involved the claim

55:41.760 --> 55:45.080
 that what was being avoided was the targeting

55:45.080 --> 55:49.080
 of Chinese scientists.

55:49.080 --> 55:50.040
 And my point would be,

55:50.040 --> 55:53.420
 I don't wanna see the targeting of anyone.

55:53.420 --> 55:55.880
 I don't want to see racism of any kind.

55:55.880 --> 56:00.700
 On the other hand, once you create license to lie

56:00.700 --> 56:05.700
 in order to protect individuals when the world has a stake

56:05.700 --> 56:08.620
 in knowing what happened, then it is inevitable

56:08.620 --> 56:12.300
 that that process, that license to lie will be used

56:12.300 --> 56:14.100
 by the thing that captures institutions

56:14.100 --> 56:15.220
 for its own purposes.

56:15.220 --> 56:19.540
 So my sense is it may be very unfortunate

56:19.540 --> 56:22.100
 if the story of what happened here

56:22.100 --> 56:26.660
 can be used against Chinese people.

56:26.660 --> 56:27.980
 That would be very unfortunate.

56:27.980 --> 56:30.980
 And as I think I mentioned,

56:30.980 --> 56:33.740
 Heather and I have taken great pains to point out

56:33.740 --> 56:35.820
 that this doesn't look like a Chinese failure.

56:35.820 --> 56:36.640
 It looks like a failure

56:36.640 --> 56:38.420
 of the international scientific community.

56:38.420 --> 56:41.140
 So I think it is important to broadcast that message

56:41.140 --> 56:43.920
 along with the analysis of the evidence.

56:43.920 --> 56:46.780
 But no matter what happened, we have a right to know.

56:46.780 --> 56:50.860
 And I frankly do not take the institutional layer

56:50.860 --> 56:53.500
 at its word that its motivations are honorable

56:53.500 --> 56:56.720
 and that it was protecting good hearted scientists

56:56.720 --> 56:58.100
 at the expense of the world.

56:58.100 --> 57:00.300
 That explanation does not add up.

57:00.300 --> 57:04.260
 Well, this is a very interesting question about

57:04.260 --> 57:08.300
 whether it's ever okay to lie at the institutional layer

57:08.300 --> 57:11.180
 to protect the populace.

57:12.940 --> 57:16.260
 I think both you and I are probably on the same,

57:18.380 --> 57:21.900
 have the same sense that it's a slippery slope.

57:21.900 --> 57:25.220
 Even if it's an effective mechanism in the short term,

57:25.220 --> 57:27.700
 in the long term, it's going to be destructive.

57:27.700 --> 57:30.940
 This happened with masks.

57:30.940 --> 57:32.540
 This happened with other things.

57:32.540 --> 57:34.620
 If you look at just history pandemics,

57:35.420 --> 57:40.420
 there's an idea that panic is destructive

57:40.420 --> 57:41.300
 amongst the populace.

57:41.300 --> 57:44.440
 So you want to construct a narrative,

57:44.440 --> 57:48.520
 whether it's a lie or not to minimize panic.

57:49.540 --> 57:52.760
 But you're suggesting that almost in all cases,

57:52.760 --> 57:57.560
 and I think that was the lesson from the pandemic

57:57.560 --> 57:59.260
 in the early 20th century,

57:59.260 --> 58:03.660
 that lying creates distrust

58:03.660 --> 58:08.220
 and distrust in the institutions is ultimately destructive.

58:08.220 --> 58:10.820
 That's your sense that lying is not okay?

58:10.820 --> 58:12.380
 Well, okay.

58:12.380 --> 58:15.800
 There are obviously places where complete transparency

58:15.800 --> 58:17.300
 is not a good idea, right?

58:17.300 --> 58:19.980
 To the extent that you broadcast a technology

58:19.980 --> 58:24.220
 that allows one individual to hold the world hostage,

58:24.220 --> 58:27.660
 obviously you've got something to be navigated.

58:27.660 --> 58:32.660
 But in general, I don't believe that the scientific system

58:32.900 --> 58:36.100
 should be lying to us.

58:36.100 --> 58:39.820
 In the case of this particular lie,

58:39.820 --> 58:44.820
 the idea that the wellbeing of Chinese scientists

58:45.380 --> 58:50.220
 outweighs the wellbeing of the world is preposterous.

58:50.220 --> 58:51.900
 Right, as you point out,

58:51.900 --> 58:53.460
 one thing that rests on this question

58:53.460 --> 58:55.980
 is whether we continue to do this kind of research

58:55.980 --> 58:56.820
 going forward.

58:56.820 --> 58:58.940
 And the scientists in question, all of them,

58:58.940 --> 59:03.300
 American, Chinese, all of them were pushing the idea

59:03.300 --> 59:06.140
 that the risk of a zoonotic spillover event

59:06.140 --> 59:08.860
 causing a major and highly destructive pandemic

59:08.860 --> 59:12.260
 was so great that we had to risk this.

59:12.260 --> 59:14.420
 Now, if they themselves have caused it,

59:14.420 --> 59:16.780
 and if they are wrong, as I believe they are,

59:16.780 --> 59:19.260
 about the likelihood of a major world pandemic

59:19.260 --> 59:20.780
 spilling out of nature

59:20.780 --> 59:24.660
 in the way that they wrote into their grant applications,

59:24.660 --> 59:28.020
 then the danger is the call is coming from inside the house

59:28.020 --> 59:31.240
 and we have to look at that.

59:31.240 --> 59:33.860
 And yes, whatever we have to do

59:33.860 --> 59:38.300
 to protect scientists from retribution, we should do,

59:38.300 --> 59:42.900
 but we cannot protecting them by lying to the world.

59:42.900 --> 59:45.180
 And even worse,

59:45.180 --> 59:50.180
 by demonizing people like me, like Josh Rogin,

59:54.060 --> 59:58.980
 like Yuri Dagan, the entire drastic group on Twitter,

59:58.980 --> 1:00:02.980
 by demonizing us for simply following the evidence

1:00:02.980 --> 1:00:05.740
 is to set a terrible precedent, right?

1:00:05.740 --> 1:00:08.420
 You're demonizing people for using the scientific method

1:00:08.420 --> 1:00:11.980
 to evaluate evidence that is available to us in the world.

1:00:11.980 --> 1:00:16.020
 What a terrible crime it is to teach that lesson, right?

1:00:16.020 --> 1:00:18.060
 Thou shalt not use scientific tools.

1:00:18.060 --> 1:00:19.300
 No, I'm sorry.

1:00:19.300 --> 1:00:22.540
 Whatever your license to lie is, it doesn't extend to that.

1:00:22.540 --> 1:00:25.420
 Yeah, I've seen the attacks on you,

1:00:25.420 --> 1:00:28.500
 the pressure on you has a very important effect

1:00:29.540 --> 1:00:34.540
 on thousands of world class biologists actually.

1:00:36.380 --> 1:00:40.020
 At MIT, colleagues of mine, people I know,

1:00:40.020 --> 1:00:44.140
 there's a slight pressure to not be allowed

1:00:44.140 --> 1:00:49.140
 to one, speak publicly and two, actually think.

1:00:51.500 --> 1:00:53.620
 Like do you even think about these ideas?

1:00:53.620 --> 1:00:55.020
 It sounds kind of ridiculous,

1:00:55.020 --> 1:00:58.720
 but just in the privacy of your own home,

1:00:58.720 --> 1:01:03.100
 to read things, to think, it's many people,

1:01:03.100 --> 1:01:06.940
 many world class biologists that I know

1:01:06.940 --> 1:01:10.740
 will just avoid looking at the data.

1:01:10.740 --> 1:01:12.180
 There's not even that many people

1:01:12.180 --> 1:01:15.340
 that are publicly opposing gain of function research.

1:01:15.340 --> 1:01:18.860
 They're also like, it's not worth it.

1:01:18.860 --> 1:01:20.140
 It's not worth the battle.

1:01:20.140 --> 1:01:21.720
 And there's many people that kind of argue

1:01:21.720 --> 1:01:24.800
 that those battles should be fought in private,

1:01:27.100 --> 1:01:31.300
 with colleagues in the privacy of the scientific community

1:01:31.300 --> 1:01:35.500
 that the public is somehow not maybe intelligent enough

1:01:35.500 --> 1:01:38.300
 to be able to deal with the complexities

1:01:38.300 --> 1:01:39.780
 of this kind of discussion.

1:01:39.780 --> 1:01:41.420
 I don't know, but the final result

1:01:41.420 --> 1:01:44.100
 is combined with the bullying of you

1:01:44.100 --> 1:01:47.100
 and all the different pressures

1:01:47.100 --> 1:01:49.060
 in the academic institutions is that

1:01:49.060 --> 1:01:51.260
 it's just people are self censoring

1:01:51.260 --> 1:01:53.420
 and silencing themselves

1:01:53.420 --> 1:01:55.220
 and silencing the most important thing,

1:01:55.220 --> 1:01:57.120
 which is the power of their brains.

1:01:58.260 --> 1:02:01.560
 Like these people are brilliant.

1:02:01.560 --> 1:02:04.540
 And the fact that they're not utilizing their brain

1:02:04.540 --> 1:02:06.740
 to come up with solutions

1:02:06.740 --> 1:02:11.520
 outside of the conformist line of thinking is tragic.

1:02:11.520 --> 1:02:12.580
 Well, it is.

1:02:12.580 --> 1:02:15.900
 I also think that we have to look at it

1:02:15.900 --> 1:02:17.780
 and understand it for what it is.

1:02:17.780 --> 1:02:20.900
 For one thing, it's kind of a cryptic totalitarianism.

1:02:20.900 --> 1:02:23.540
 Somehow people's sense of what they're allowed

1:02:23.540 --> 1:02:25.780
 to think about, talk about, discuss

1:02:25.780 --> 1:02:27.380
 is causing them to self censor.

1:02:27.380 --> 1:02:30.380
 And I can tell you it's causing many of them to rationalize,

1:02:30.380 --> 1:02:31.280
 which is even worse.

1:02:31.280 --> 1:02:34.660
 They're blinding themselves to what they can see.

1:02:34.660 --> 1:02:36.880
 But it is also the case, I believe,

1:02:37.900 --> 1:02:40.180
 that what you're describing about what people said,

1:02:40.180 --> 1:02:43.060
 and a great many people understood

1:02:43.060 --> 1:02:45.060
 that the lab leak hypothesis

1:02:45.060 --> 1:02:47.060
 could not be taken off the table,

1:02:47.060 --> 1:02:48.900
 but they didn't say so publicly.

1:02:48.900 --> 1:02:52.800
 And I think that their discussions with each other

1:02:52.800 --> 1:02:55.700
 about why they did not say what they understood,

1:02:55.700 --> 1:02:59.180
 that's what capture sounds like on the inside.

1:02:59.180 --> 1:03:02.940
 I don't know exactly what force captured the institutions.

1:03:02.940 --> 1:03:07.940
 I don't think anybody knows for sure out here in public.

1:03:07.980 --> 1:03:10.060
 I don't even know that it wasn't just simply a process.

1:03:10.060 --> 1:03:13.660
 But you have these institutions.

1:03:13.660 --> 1:03:18.660
 They are behaving towards a kind of somatic obligation.

1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:22.820
 They have lost sight of what they were built to accomplish.

1:03:22.820 --> 1:03:26.180
 And on the inside, the way they avoid

1:03:26.180 --> 1:03:28.460
 going back to their original mission

1:03:28.460 --> 1:03:30.140
 is to say things to themselves,

1:03:30.140 --> 1:03:32.620
 like the public can't have this discussion.

1:03:32.620 --> 1:03:34.220
 It can't be trusted with it.

1:03:34.220 --> 1:03:35.780
 Yes, we need to be able to talk about this,

1:03:35.780 --> 1:03:36.780
 but it has to be private.

1:03:36.780 --> 1:03:38.140
 Whatever it is they say to themselves,

1:03:38.140 --> 1:03:40.300
 that is what capture sounds like on the inside.

1:03:40.300 --> 1:03:44.460
 It's a institutional rationalization mechanism.

1:03:44.460 --> 1:03:46.460
 And it's very, very deadly.

1:03:46.460 --> 1:03:50.620
 And at the point you go from lab leak to repurposed drugs,

1:03:50.620 --> 1:03:54.700
 you can see that it's very deadly in a very direct way.

1:03:54.700 --> 1:03:59.500
 Yeah, I see this in my field with things

1:03:59.500 --> 1:04:01.740
 like autonomous weapon systems.

1:04:01.740 --> 1:04:04.500
 People in AI do not talk about the use of AI

1:04:04.500 --> 1:04:05.900
 in weapon systems.

1:04:05.900 --> 1:04:08.700
 They kind of avoid the idea that AI's use them

1:04:08.700 --> 1:04:09.820
 in the military.

1:04:09.820 --> 1:04:13.100
 It's kind of funny, there's this like kind of discomfort

1:04:13.100 --> 1:04:14.460
 and they're like, they all hurry,

1:04:14.460 --> 1:04:17.900
 like something scary happens and a bunch of sheep

1:04:17.900 --> 1:04:19.300
 kind of like run away.

1:04:19.300 --> 1:04:21.340
 That's what it looks like.

1:04:21.340 --> 1:04:23.660
 And I don't even know what to do about it.

1:04:23.660 --> 1:04:26.460
 And then I feel this natural pull

1:04:26.460 --> 1:04:29.260
 every time I bring up autonomous weapon systems

1:04:29.260 --> 1:04:30.740
 to go along with the sheep.

1:04:30.740 --> 1:04:33.660
 There's a natural kind of pull towards that direction

1:04:33.660 --> 1:04:36.260
 because it's like, what can I do as one person?

1:04:37.140 --> 1:04:40.260
 Now there's currently nothing destructive happening

1:04:40.260 --> 1:04:42.060
 with autonomous weapon systems.

1:04:42.060 --> 1:04:44.980
 So we're in like in the early days of this race

1:04:44.980 --> 1:04:48.180
 that in 10, 20 years might become a real problem.

1:04:48.180 --> 1:04:50.500
 Now where the discussion we're having now,

1:04:50.500 --> 1:04:55.420
 we're now facing the result of that in the space of viruses,

1:04:55.420 --> 1:04:58.780
 like for many years avoiding the conversations here.

1:05:00.500 --> 1:05:03.580
 I don't know what to do that in the early days,

1:05:03.580 --> 1:05:05.980
 but I think we have to, I guess, create institutions

1:05:05.980 --> 1:05:08.300
 where people can stand out.

1:05:08.300 --> 1:05:12.100
 People can stand out and like basically be individual

1:05:12.100 --> 1:05:16.580
 thinkers and break out into all kinds of spaces of ideas

1:05:16.580 --> 1:05:19.620
 that allow us to think freely, freedom of thought.

1:05:19.620 --> 1:05:22.900
 And maybe that requires a decentralization of institutions.

1:05:22.900 --> 1:05:26.060
 Well, years ago, I came up with a concept

1:05:26.060 --> 1:05:28.820
 called cultivated insecurity.

1:05:28.820 --> 1:05:31.700
 And the idea is, let's just take the example

1:05:31.700 --> 1:05:34.140
 of the average Joe, right?

1:05:34.140 --> 1:05:37.660
 The average Joe has a job somewhere

1:05:37.660 --> 1:05:42.300
 and their mortgage, their medical insurance,

1:05:42.300 --> 1:05:46.940
 their retirement, their connection with the economy

1:05:46.940 --> 1:05:49.660
 is to one degree or another dependent

1:05:49.660 --> 1:05:52.620
 on their relationship with the employer.

1:05:54.060 --> 1:05:57.420
 That means that there is a strong incentive,

1:05:57.420 --> 1:06:00.780
 especially in any industry where it's not easy to move

1:06:00.780 --> 1:06:02.100
 from one employer to the next.

1:06:02.100 --> 1:06:05.140
 There's a strong incentive to stay

1:06:05.140 --> 1:06:07.100
 in your employer's good graces, right?

1:06:07.100 --> 1:06:09.260
 So it creates a very top down dynamic,

1:06:09.260 --> 1:06:13.740
 not only in terms of who gets to tell other people

1:06:13.740 --> 1:06:16.220
 what to do, but it really comes down to

1:06:16.220 --> 1:06:18.860
 who gets to tell other people how to think.

1:06:18.860 --> 1:06:21.260
 So that's extremely dangerous.

1:06:21.260 --> 1:06:25.540
 The way out of it is to cultivate security

1:06:25.540 --> 1:06:28.380
 to the extent that somebody is in a position

1:06:28.380 --> 1:06:32.500
 to go against the grain and have it not be a catastrophe

1:06:32.500 --> 1:06:34.980
 for their family and their ability to earn,

1:06:34.980 --> 1:06:36.620
 you will see that behavior a lot more.

1:06:36.620 --> 1:06:38.780
 So I would argue that some of what you're talking about

1:06:38.780 --> 1:06:41.980
 is just a simple predictable consequence

1:06:41.980 --> 1:06:46.980
 of the concentration of the sources of wellbeing

1:06:48.100 --> 1:06:50.540
 and that this is a solvable problem.

1:06:51.540 --> 1:06:55.340
 You got a chance to talk with Joe Rogan yesterday.

1:06:55.340 --> 1:06:56.540
 Yes, I did.

1:06:56.540 --> 1:06:59.300
 And I just saw the episode was released

1:06:59.300 --> 1:07:03.180
 and Ivermectin is trending on Twitter.

1:07:04.060 --> 1:07:06.020
 Joe told me it was an incredible conversation.

1:07:06.020 --> 1:07:07.380
 I look forward to listening to it today.

1:07:07.380 --> 1:07:10.660
 Many people have probably, by the time this is released,

1:07:10.660 --> 1:07:12.060
 have already listened to it.

1:07:13.100 --> 1:07:18.100
 I think it would be interesting to discuss a postmortem.

1:07:18.540 --> 1:07:21.060
 How do you feel how that conversation went?

1:07:21.060 --> 1:07:25.580
 And maybe broadly, how do you see the story

1:07:25.580 --> 1:07:30.420
 as it's unfolding of Ivermectin from the origins

1:07:30.420 --> 1:07:34.980
 from before COVID 19 through 2020 to today?

1:07:34.980 --> 1:07:36.820
 I very much enjoyed talking to Joe

1:07:36.820 --> 1:07:41.380
 and I'm undescribably grateful

1:07:41.380 --> 1:07:44.380
 that he would take the risk of such a discussion,

1:07:44.380 --> 1:07:46.460
 that he would, as he described it,

1:07:46.460 --> 1:07:49.420
 do an emergency podcast on the subject,

1:07:49.420 --> 1:07:52.060
 which I think that was not an exaggeration.

1:07:52.060 --> 1:07:55.420
 This needed to happen for various reasons

1:07:55.420 --> 1:07:59.780
 that he took us down the road of talking about

1:07:59.780 --> 1:08:01.940
 the censorship campaign against Ivermectin,

1:08:01.940 --> 1:08:04.860
 which I find utterly shocking

1:08:04.860 --> 1:08:07.180
 and talking about the drug itself.

1:08:07.180 --> 1:08:10.900
 And I should say we talked, we had Pierre Corey available.

1:08:10.900 --> 1:08:12.780
 He came on the podcast as well.

1:08:12.780 --> 1:08:17.100
 He is, of course, the face of the FLCCC,

1:08:17.100 --> 1:08:20.500
 the Frontline COVID 19 Critical Care Alliance.

1:08:20.500 --> 1:08:23.780
 These are doctors who have innovated ways

1:08:23.780 --> 1:08:26.780
 of treating COVID patients and they happened on Ivermectin

1:08:26.780 --> 1:08:29.580
 and have been using it.

1:08:29.580 --> 1:08:32.980
 And I hesitate to use the word advocating for it

1:08:32.980 --> 1:08:36.180
 because that's not really the role of doctors or scientists,

1:08:36.180 --> 1:08:38.300
 but they are advocating for it in the sense

1:08:38.300 --> 1:08:41.620
 that there is this pressure not to talk about

1:08:41.620 --> 1:08:44.900
 its effectiveness for reasons that we can go into.

1:08:44.900 --> 1:08:48.660
 So maybe step back and say, what is Ivermectin

1:08:48.660 --> 1:08:52.060
 and how much studies have been done

1:08:52.060 --> 1:08:53.540
 to show its effectiveness?

1:08:54.500 --> 1:08:56.460
 So Ivermectin is an interesting drug.

1:08:56.460 --> 1:08:58.940
 It was discovered in the 70s

1:08:58.940 --> 1:09:03.380
 by a Japanese scientist named Satoshi Omura

1:09:03.380 --> 1:09:08.180
 and he found it in soil near a Japanese golf course.

1:09:08.180 --> 1:09:10.500
 So I would just point out in passing

1:09:10.500 --> 1:09:12.980
 that if we were to stop self silencing

1:09:12.980 --> 1:09:17.300
 over the possibility that Asians will be demonized

1:09:17.300 --> 1:09:20.020
 over the possible lab leak in Wuhan

1:09:20.020 --> 1:09:22.620
 and to recognize that actually the natural course

1:09:22.620 --> 1:09:27.620
 of the story has a likely lab leak in China,

1:09:27.620 --> 1:09:31.900
 it has a unlikely hero in Japan,

1:09:32.780 --> 1:09:36.820
 the story is naturally not a simple one.

1:09:36.820 --> 1:09:40.900
 But in any case, Omura discovered this molecule.

1:09:40.900 --> 1:09:45.540
 He sent it to a friend who was at Merck,

1:09:45.540 --> 1:09:46.860
 scientist named Campbell.

1:09:46.860 --> 1:09:50.460
 They won a Nobel Prize for the discovery

1:09:50.460 --> 1:09:54.980
 of the Ivermectin molecule in 2015.

1:09:54.980 --> 1:09:58.580
 Its initial use was in treating parasitic infections.

1:09:58.580 --> 1:10:02.460
 It's very effective in treating the worm

1:10:02.460 --> 1:10:04.900
 that causes river blindness,

1:10:04.900 --> 1:10:08.700
 the pathogen that causes elephantitis, scabies.

1:10:08.700 --> 1:10:10.860
 It's a very effective anti parasite drug.

1:10:10.860 --> 1:10:11.980
 It's extremely safe.

1:10:11.980 --> 1:10:14.620
 It's on the WHO's list of essential medications.

1:10:14.620 --> 1:10:16.860
 It's safe for children.

1:10:16.860 --> 1:10:20.100
 It has been administered something like 4 billion times

1:10:20.100 --> 1:10:22.260
 in the last four decades.

1:10:22.260 --> 1:10:25.420
 It has been given away in the millions of doses

1:10:25.420 --> 1:10:27.780
 by Merck in Africa.

1:10:27.780 --> 1:10:30.740
 People have been on it for long periods of time.

1:10:30.740 --> 1:10:32.500
 And in fact, one of the reasons

1:10:32.500 --> 1:10:36.700
 that Africa may have had less severe impacts from COVID 19

1:10:36.700 --> 1:10:40.740
 is that Ivermectin is widely used there to prevent parasites

1:10:40.740 --> 1:10:43.140
 and the drug appears to have a long lasting impact.

1:10:43.140 --> 1:10:45.500
 So it's an interesting molecule.

1:10:45.500 --> 1:10:49.340
 It was discovered some time ago apparently

1:10:49.340 --> 1:10:50.940
 that it has antiviral properties.

1:10:50.940 --> 1:10:54.660
 And so it was tested early in the COVID 19 pandemic

1:10:54.660 --> 1:10:58.540
 to see if it might work to treat humans with COVID.

1:10:58.540 --> 1:11:02.060
 It turned out to have very promising evidence

1:11:02.060 --> 1:11:03.420
 that it did treat humans.

1:11:03.420 --> 1:11:04.940
 It was tested in tissues.

1:11:04.940 --> 1:11:08.700
 It was tested at a very high dosage, which confuses people.

1:11:08.700 --> 1:11:10.860
 They think that those of us who believe

1:11:10.860 --> 1:11:14.620
 that Ivermectin might be useful in confronting this disease

1:11:14.620 --> 1:11:17.380
 are advocating those high doses, which is not the case.

1:11:17.380 --> 1:11:20.580
 But in any case, there have been quite a number of studies.

1:11:20.580 --> 1:11:23.780
 A wonderful meta analysis was finally released.

1:11:23.780 --> 1:11:25.420
 We had seen it in preprint version,

1:11:25.420 --> 1:11:29.580
 but it was finally peer reviewed and published this last week.

1:11:29.580 --> 1:11:34.060
 It reveals that the drug, as clinicians have been telling us,

1:11:34.060 --> 1:11:35.060
 those who have been using it,

1:11:35.060 --> 1:11:37.620
 it's highly effective at treating people with the disease,

1:11:37.620 --> 1:11:39.420
 especially if you get to them early.

1:11:39.420 --> 1:11:43.300
 And it showed an 86% effectiveness as a prophylactic

1:11:43.300 --> 1:11:46.300
 to prevent people from contracting COVID.

1:11:46.300 --> 1:11:49.780
 And that number, 86%, is high enough

1:11:49.780 --> 1:11:54.780
 to drive SARS CoV2 to extinction if we wished to deploy it.

1:11:55.340 --> 1:11:58.340
 First of all, the meta analysis,

1:11:58.340 --> 1:12:01.540
 is this the Ivermectin for COVID 19

1:12:01.540 --> 1:12:04.300
 real time meta analysis of 60 studies?

1:12:04.300 --> 1:12:06.300
 Or there's a bunch of meta analysis there.

1:12:06.300 --> 1:12:09.180
 Because I was really impressed by the real time meta analysis

1:12:09.180 --> 1:12:11.340
 that keeps getting updated.

1:12:11.340 --> 1:12:12.420
 I don't know if it's the same kind of thing.

1:12:12.420 --> 1:12:17.420
 The one at ivmmeta.com?

1:12:18.060 --> 1:12:21.780
 Well, I saw it at c19ivermeta.com.

1:12:21.780 --> 1:12:24.020
 No, this is not that meta analysis.

1:12:24.020 --> 1:12:26.140
 So that is, as you say, a living meta analysis

1:12:26.140 --> 1:12:27.780
 where you can watch as evidence rolls in.

1:12:27.780 --> 1:12:29.100
 Which is super cool, by the way.

1:12:29.100 --> 1:12:29.940
 It's really cool.

1:12:29.940 --> 1:12:32.220
 And they've got some really nice graphics

1:12:32.220 --> 1:12:35.100
 that allow you to understand, well, what is the evidence?

1:12:35.100 --> 1:12:37.620
 It's concentrated around this level of effectiveness,

1:12:37.620 --> 1:12:38.460
 et cetera.

1:12:38.460 --> 1:12:40.900
 So anyway, it's a great site, well worth paying attention to.

1:12:40.900 --> 1:12:43.540
 No, this is a meta analysis.

1:12:43.540 --> 1:12:46.380
 I don't know any of the authors but one.

1:12:46.380 --> 1:12:49.380
 Second author is Tess Lorry of the BIRD group.

1:12:49.380 --> 1:12:54.380
 BIRD being a group of analysts and doctors in Britain

1:12:55.620 --> 1:12:59.580
 that is playing a role similar to the FLCCC here in the US.

1:13:00.540 --> 1:13:02.020
 So anyway, this is a meta analysis

1:13:02.020 --> 1:13:06.220
 that Tess Lorry and others did

1:13:06.220 --> 1:13:08.100
 of all of the available evidence.

1:13:08.100 --> 1:13:10.700
 And it's quite compelling.

1:13:10.700 --> 1:13:12.820
 People can look for it on my Twitter.

1:13:12.820 --> 1:13:15.100
 I will put it up and people can find it there.

1:13:15.100 --> 1:13:17.380
 So what about dose here?

1:13:18.860 --> 1:13:22.260
 In terms of safety, what do we understand

1:13:22.260 --> 1:13:23.780
 about the kind of dose required

1:13:23.780 --> 1:13:26.820
 to have that level of effectiveness?

1:13:26.820 --> 1:13:29.140
 And what do we understand about the safety

1:13:29.140 --> 1:13:30.180
 of that kind of dose?

1:13:30.180 --> 1:13:32.540
 So let me just say, I'm not a medical doctor.

1:13:32.540 --> 1:13:34.420
 I'm a biologist.

1:13:34.420 --> 1:13:39.180
 I'm on ivermectin in lieu of vaccination.

1:13:39.180 --> 1:13:42.500
 In terms of dosage, there is one reason for concern,

1:13:42.500 --> 1:13:45.740
 which is that the most effective dose for prophylaxis

1:13:45.740 --> 1:13:49.460
 involves something like weekly administration.

1:13:49.460 --> 1:13:53.660
 And because that is not a historical pattern of use

1:13:53.660 --> 1:13:56.380
 for the drug, it is possible

1:13:56.380 --> 1:13:58.020
 that there is some longterm implication

1:13:58.020 --> 1:14:02.460
 of being on it weekly for a long period of time.

1:14:02.460 --> 1:14:04.100
 There's not a strong indication of that.

1:14:04.100 --> 1:14:07.660
 The safety signal that we have over people using the drug

1:14:07.660 --> 1:14:10.020
 over many years and using it in high doses.

1:14:10.020 --> 1:14:12.300
 In fact, Dr. Corey told me yesterday

1:14:13.500 --> 1:14:15.340
 that there are cases in which people

1:14:15.340 --> 1:14:17.660
 have made calculation errors

1:14:17.660 --> 1:14:19.820
 and taken a massive overdose of the drug

1:14:19.820 --> 1:14:21.420
 and had no ill effect.

1:14:21.420 --> 1:14:23.300
 So anyway, there's lots of reasons

1:14:23.300 --> 1:14:24.860
 to think the drug is comparatively safe,

1:14:24.860 --> 1:14:27.060
 but no drug is perfectly safe.

1:14:27.060 --> 1:14:29.700
 And I do worry about the longterm implications

1:14:29.700 --> 1:14:30.740
 of taking it.

1:14:30.740 --> 1:14:32.580
 I also think it's very likely

1:14:32.580 --> 1:14:37.580
 that because the drug is administered

1:14:37.900 --> 1:14:42.220
 in a dose something like, let's say 15 milligrams

1:14:42.220 --> 1:14:44.860
 for somebody my size once a week

1:14:44.860 --> 1:14:48.540
 after you've gone through the initial double dose

1:14:48.540 --> 1:14:50.380
 that you take 48 hours apart,

1:14:51.340 --> 1:14:55.340
 it is apparent that if the amount of drug in your system

1:14:55.340 --> 1:14:58.300
 is sufficient to be protective at the end of the week,

1:14:58.300 --> 1:15:00.140
 then it was probably far too high

1:15:00.140 --> 1:15:01.300
 at the beginning of the week.

1:15:01.300 --> 1:15:03.340
 So there's a question about whether or not

1:15:03.340 --> 1:15:05.940
 you could flatten out the intake

1:15:05.940 --> 1:15:09.780
 so that the amount of ivermectin goes down,

1:15:09.780 --> 1:15:10.940
 but the protection remains.

1:15:10.940 --> 1:15:13.180
 I have little doubt that that would be discovered

1:15:13.180 --> 1:15:14.180
 if we looked for it.

1:15:15.180 --> 1:15:18.900
 But that said, it does seem to be quite safe,

1:15:18.900 --> 1:15:21.020
 highly effective at preventing COVID.

1:15:21.020 --> 1:15:23.980
 The 86% number is plenty high enough

1:15:23.980 --> 1:15:27.700
 for us to drive SARS CoV2 to extinction

1:15:27.700 --> 1:15:31.420
 in light of its R0 number of slightly more than two.

1:15:33.140 --> 1:15:36.660
 And so why we are not using it is a bit of a mystery.

1:15:36.660 --> 1:15:39.140
 So even if everything you said now

1:15:39.140 --> 1:15:40.940
 turns out to be not correct,

1:15:42.740 --> 1:15:46.860
 it is nevertheless obvious that it's sufficiently promising

1:15:46.860 --> 1:15:50.500
 and it always has been in order to merit rigorous

1:15:50.500 --> 1:15:53.340
 scientific exploration, investigation,

1:15:53.340 --> 1:15:57.860
 doing a lot of studies and certainly not censoring

1:15:57.860 --> 1:16:00.260
 the science or the discussion of it.

1:16:00.260 --> 1:16:05.260
 So before we talk about the various vaccines for COVID 19,

1:16:06.020 --> 1:16:08.180
 I'd like to talk to you about censorship.

1:16:08.180 --> 1:16:10.100
 Given everything you're saying,

1:16:10.100 --> 1:16:14.740
 why did YouTube and other places

1:16:14.740 --> 1:16:19.740
 censor discussion of ivermectin?

1:16:19.740 --> 1:16:21.940
 Well, there's a question about why they say they did it

1:16:21.940 --> 1:16:24.620
 and there's a question about why they actually did it.

1:16:24.620 --> 1:16:27.260
 Now, it is worth mentioning

1:16:27.260 --> 1:16:30.660
 that YouTube is part of a consortium.

1:16:31.540 --> 1:16:36.540
 It is partnered with Twitter, Facebook, Reuters, AP,

1:16:36.980 --> 1:16:40.180
 Financial Times, Washington Post,

1:16:40.180 --> 1:16:42.780
 some other notable organizations.

1:16:42.780 --> 1:16:46.780
 And that this group has appointed itself

1:16:46.780 --> 1:16:48.620
 the arbiter of truth.

1:16:48.620 --> 1:16:53.140
 In effect, they have decided to control discussion

1:16:53.140 --> 1:16:56.660
 ostensibly to prevent the distribution of misinformation.

1:16:57.620 --> 1:16:59.220
 Now, how have they chosen to do that?

1:16:59.220 --> 1:17:03.420
 In this case, they have chosen to simply utilize

1:17:03.420 --> 1:17:06.780
 the recommendations of the WHO and the CDC

1:17:06.780 --> 1:17:09.020
 and apply them as if they are synonymous

1:17:09.020 --> 1:17:10.100
 with scientific truth.

1:17:11.180 --> 1:17:14.260
 Problem, even at their best,

1:17:14.260 --> 1:17:17.340
 the WHO and CDC are not scientific entities.

1:17:17.340 --> 1:17:20.900
 They are entities that are about public health.

1:17:20.900 --> 1:17:24.700
 And public health has this, whether it's right or not,

1:17:24.700 --> 1:17:26.780
 and I believe I disagree with it,

1:17:26.780 --> 1:17:31.780
 but it has this self assigned right to lie

1:17:34.660 --> 1:17:36.740
 that comes from the fact that there is game theory

1:17:36.740 --> 1:17:38.580
 that works against, for example,

1:17:38.580 --> 1:17:40.580
 a successful vaccination campaign.

1:17:40.580 --> 1:17:44.660
 That if everybody else takes a vaccine

1:17:44.660 --> 1:17:48.260
 and therefore the herd becomes immune through vaccination

1:17:48.260 --> 1:17:50.540
 and you decide not to take a vaccine,

1:17:50.540 --> 1:17:52.980
 then you benefit from the immunity of the herd

1:17:52.980 --> 1:17:55.060
 without having taken the risk.

1:17:55.060 --> 1:17:58.620
 So people who do best are the people who opt out.

1:17:58.620 --> 1:17:59.660
 That's a hazard.

1:17:59.660 --> 1:18:02.340
 And the WHO and CDC as public health entities

1:18:02.340 --> 1:18:07.340
 effectively oversimplify stories in order to make sense

1:18:07.340 --> 1:18:11.620
 of oversimplify stories in order that that game theory

1:18:11.620 --> 1:18:15.620
 does not cause a predictable tragedy of the commons.

1:18:15.620 --> 1:18:19.260
 With that said, once that right to lie exists,

1:18:19.260 --> 1:18:23.020
 then it turns out to serve the interests of,

1:18:23.020 --> 1:18:25.100
 for example, pharmaceutical companies,

1:18:25.100 --> 1:18:27.140
 which have emergency use authorizations

1:18:27.140 --> 1:18:28.860
 that require that there not be a safe

1:18:28.860 --> 1:18:31.980
 and effective treatment and have immunity from liability

1:18:31.980 --> 1:18:34.780
 for harms caused by their product.

1:18:34.780 --> 1:18:37.420
 So that's a recipe for disaster, right?

1:18:37.420 --> 1:18:40.980
 You don't need to be a sophisticated thinker

1:18:40.980 --> 1:18:43.140
 about complex systems to see the hazard

1:18:43.140 --> 1:18:48.140
 of immunizing a company from the harm of its own product

1:18:48.300 --> 1:18:51.620
 at the same time that that product can only exist

1:18:51.620 --> 1:18:55.180
 in the market if some other product that works better

1:18:55.180 --> 1:18:57.100
 somehow fails to be noticed.

1:18:57.100 --> 1:19:02.100
 So somehow YouTube is doing the bidding of Merck and others.

1:19:02.380 --> 1:19:03.980
 Whether it knows that that's what it's doing,

1:19:03.980 --> 1:19:05.020
 I have no idea.

1:19:05.020 --> 1:19:08.380
 I think this may be another case of an autopilot

1:19:08.380 --> 1:19:09.660
 that thinks it's doing the right thing

1:19:09.660 --> 1:19:12.980
 because it's parroting the corrupt wisdom

1:19:12.980 --> 1:19:14.340
 of the WHO and the CDC,

1:19:14.340 --> 1:19:17.020
 but the WHO and the CDC have been wrong again and again

1:19:17.020 --> 1:19:18.100
 in this pandemic.

1:19:18.100 --> 1:19:22.260
 And the irony here is that with YouTube coming after me,

1:19:22.260 --> 1:19:25.620
 well, my channel has been right where the WHO and CDC

1:19:25.620 --> 1:19:29.060
 have been wrong consistently over the whole pandemic.

1:19:29.060 --> 1:19:32.980
 So how is it that YouTube is censoring us

1:19:32.980 --> 1:19:35.140
 because the WHO and CDC disagree with us

1:19:35.140 --> 1:19:36.940
 when in fact, in past disagreements,

1:19:36.940 --> 1:19:38.620
 we've been right and they've been wrong?

1:19:38.620 --> 1:19:41.500
 There's so much to talk about here.

1:19:41.500 --> 1:19:46.500
 So I've heard this many times actually

1:19:47.060 --> 1:19:49.820
 on the inside of YouTube and with colleagues

1:19:49.820 --> 1:19:54.820
 that I've talked with is they kind of in a very casual way

1:19:55.540 --> 1:19:59.620
 say their job is simply to slow

1:19:59.620 --> 1:20:03.820
 or prevent the spread of misinformation.

1:20:03.820 --> 1:20:06.940
 And they say like, that's an easy thing to do.

1:20:06.940 --> 1:20:11.780
 Like to know what is true or not is an easy thing to do.

1:20:11.780 --> 1:20:14.300
 And so from the YouTube perspective,

1:20:14.300 --> 1:20:19.300
 I think they basically outsource of the task

1:20:21.180 --> 1:20:25.340
 of knowing what is true or not to public institutions

1:20:25.340 --> 1:20:29.260
 that on a basic Google search claim

1:20:29.260 --> 1:20:30.980
 to be the arbiters of truth.

1:20:32.980 --> 1:20:37.980
 So if you were YouTube who are exceptionally profitable

1:20:38.780 --> 1:20:43.300
 and exceptionally powerful in terms of controlling

1:20:43.300 --> 1:20:46.980
 what people get to see or not, what would you do?

1:20:46.980 --> 1:20:49.820
 Would you take a stand, a public stand

1:20:49.820 --> 1:20:52.900
 against the WHO, CDC?

1:20:54.020 --> 1:20:57.460
 Or would you instead say, you know what?

1:20:57.460 --> 1:21:02.460
 Let's open the dam and let any video on anything fly.

1:21:02.940 --> 1:21:04.900
 What do you do here?

1:21:04.900 --> 1:21:08.420
 Say you were put, if Brent Weinstein was put in charge

1:21:08.420 --> 1:21:13.180
 of YouTube for a month in this most critical of times

1:21:13.180 --> 1:21:16.100
 where YouTube actually has incredible amounts of power

1:21:16.100 --> 1:21:20.900
 to educate the populace, to give power of knowledge

1:21:20.900 --> 1:21:24.260
 to the populace such that they can reform institutions.

1:21:24.260 --> 1:21:25.100
 What would you do?

1:21:25.100 --> 1:21:26.820
 How would you run YouTube?

1:21:26.820 --> 1:21:29.540
 Well, unfortunately, or fortunately,

1:21:29.540 --> 1:21:31.540
 this is actually quite simple.

1:21:32.380 --> 1:21:34.700
 The founders, the American founders,

1:21:34.700 --> 1:21:37.900
 settled on a counterintuitive formulation

1:21:37.900 --> 1:21:41.100
 that people should be free to say anything.

1:21:41.100 --> 1:21:43.340
 They should be free from the government

1:21:43.340 --> 1:21:45.380
 blocking them from doing so.

1:21:45.380 --> 1:21:48.620
 They did not imagine that in formulating that right,

1:21:48.620 --> 1:21:51.460
 that most of what was said would be of high quality,

1:21:51.460 --> 1:21:54.500
 nor did they imagine it would be free of harmful things.

1:21:54.500 --> 1:21:57.660
 What they correctly reasoned was that the benefit

1:21:57.660 --> 1:22:02.460
 of leaving everything so it can be said exceeds the cost,

1:22:02.460 --> 1:22:04.820
 which everyone understands to be substantial.

1:22:05.740 --> 1:22:08.660
 What I would say is they could not have anticipated

1:22:09.620 --> 1:22:13.580
 the impact, the centrality of platforms

1:22:13.580 --> 1:22:16.980
 like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, et cetera.

1:22:16.980 --> 1:22:20.140
 If they had, they would not have limited

1:22:20.140 --> 1:22:21.980
 the First Amendment as they did.

1:22:21.980 --> 1:22:24.820
 They clearly understood that the power of the federal

1:22:24.820 --> 1:22:29.820
 government was so great that it needed to be limited

1:22:29.820 --> 1:22:32.900
 by granting explicitly the right of citizens

1:22:32.900 --> 1:22:33.820
 to say anything.

1:22:34.820 --> 1:22:39.820
 In fact, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook may be more powerful

1:22:39.940 --> 1:22:42.100
 in this moment than the federal government

1:22:42.100 --> 1:22:44.140
 of their worst nightmares could have been.

1:22:44.140 --> 1:22:47.620
 The power that these entities have to control thought

1:22:47.620 --> 1:22:50.300
 and to shift civilization is so great

1:22:50.300 --> 1:22:52.420
 that we need to have those same protections.

1:22:52.420 --> 1:22:54.500
 It doesn't mean that harmful things won't be said,

1:22:54.500 --> 1:22:56.380
 but it means that nothing has changed

1:22:56.380 --> 1:22:59.020
 about the cost benefit analysis

1:22:59.020 --> 1:23:01.060
 of building the right to censor.

1:23:01.060 --> 1:23:03.260
 So if I were running YouTube,

1:23:03.260 --> 1:23:06.100
 the limit of what should be allowed

1:23:06.100 --> 1:23:08.380
 is the limit of the law, right?

1:23:08.380 --> 1:23:10.580
 If what you are doing is legal,

1:23:10.580 --> 1:23:12.420
 then it should not be YouTube's place

1:23:12.420 --> 1:23:15.620
 to limit what gets said or who gets to hear it.

1:23:15.620 --> 1:23:18.060
 That is between speakers and audience.

1:23:18.060 --> 1:23:20.420
 Will harm come from that? Of course it will.

1:23:20.420 --> 1:23:22.940
 But will net harm come from it?

1:23:22.940 --> 1:23:24.260
 No, I don't believe it will.

1:23:24.260 --> 1:23:26.220
 I believe that allowing everything to be said

1:23:26.220 --> 1:23:29.100
 does allow a process in which better ideas

1:23:29.100 --> 1:23:31.060
 do come to the fore and win out.

1:23:31.060 --> 1:23:33.820
 So you believe that in the end,

1:23:33.820 --> 1:23:37.580
 when there's complete freedom to share ideas,

1:23:37.580 --> 1:23:38.900
 that truth will win out.

1:23:39.780 --> 1:23:44.020
 So what I've noticed, just as a brief side comment,

1:23:44.020 --> 1:23:48.300
 that certain things become viral

1:23:48.300 --> 1:23:49.980
 irregardless of their truth.

1:23:51.020 --> 1:23:55.900
 I've noticed that things that are dramatic and or funny,

1:23:55.900 --> 1:23:58.540
 like things that become memes are not,

1:23:58.540 --> 1:24:00.740
 don't have to be grounded in truth.

1:24:00.740 --> 1:24:03.140
 And so that what worries me there

1:24:03.140 --> 1:24:08.140
 is that we basically maximize for drama

1:24:08.420 --> 1:24:10.380
 versus maximize for truth in a system

1:24:10.380 --> 1:24:12.820
 where everything is free.

1:24:12.820 --> 1:24:16.260
 And that is worrying in the time of emergency.

1:24:16.260 --> 1:24:18.900
 Well, yes, it's all worrying in time of emergency,

1:24:18.900 --> 1:24:19.740
 to be sure.

1:24:19.740 --> 1:24:22.300
 But I want you to notice that what you've happened on

1:24:22.300 --> 1:24:25.460
 is actually an analog for a much deeper and older problem.

1:24:26.740 --> 1:24:31.500
 Human beings are the, we are not a blank slate,

1:24:31.500 --> 1:24:34.060
 but we are the blankest slate that nature has ever devised.

1:24:34.060 --> 1:24:35.540
 And there's a reason for that, right?

1:24:35.540 --> 1:24:37.820
 It's where our flexibility comes from.

1:24:39.340 --> 1:24:42.500
 We have effectively, we are robots

1:24:42.500 --> 1:24:47.060
 in which a large fraction of the cognitive capacity

1:24:47.060 --> 1:24:50.500
 has been, or of the behavioral capacity,

1:24:50.500 --> 1:24:52.500
 has been offloaded to the software layer,

1:24:52.500 --> 1:24:55.500
 which gets written and rewritten over evolutionary time.

1:24:57.060 --> 1:25:00.980
 That means effectively that much of what we are,

1:25:00.980 --> 1:25:02.700
 in fact, the important part of what we are

1:25:02.700 --> 1:25:06.340
 is housed in the cultural layer and the conscious layer

1:25:06.340 --> 1:25:08.900
 and not in the hardware hard coding layer.

1:25:08.900 --> 1:25:13.900
 So that layer is prone to make errors, right?

1:25:14.300 --> 1:25:17.740
 And anybody who's watched a child grow up

1:25:17.740 --> 1:25:20.660
 knows that children make absurd errors all the time, right?

1:25:20.660 --> 1:25:24.220
 That's part of the process, as we were discussing earlier.

1:25:24.220 --> 1:25:26.540
 It is also true that as you look across

1:25:26.540 --> 1:25:29.580
 a field of people discussing things,

1:25:29.580 --> 1:25:33.020
 a lot of what is said is pure nonsense, it's garbage.

1:25:33.020 --> 1:25:37.500
 But the tendency of garbage to emerge

1:25:37.500 --> 1:25:39.820
 and even to spread in the short term

1:25:39.820 --> 1:25:41.900
 does not say that over the long term,

1:25:41.900 --> 1:25:45.900
 what sticks is not the valuable ideas.

1:25:45.900 --> 1:25:49.780
 So there is a high tendency for novelty

1:25:49.780 --> 1:25:51.300
 to be created in the cultural space,

1:25:51.300 --> 1:25:54.020
 but there's also a high tendency for it to go extinct.

1:25:54.020 --> 1:25:55.300
 And you have to keep that in mind.

1:25:55.300 --> 1:25:57.100
 It's not like the genome, right?

1:25:57.100 --> 1:25:59.460
 Everything is happening at a much higher rate.

1:25:59.460 --> 1:26:01.500
 Things are being created, they're being destroyed.

1:26:01.500 --> 1:26:04.620
 And I can't say that, I mean, obviously,

1:26:04.620 --> 1:26:08.060
 we've seen totalitarianism arise many times,

1:26:08.060 --> 1:26:10.620
 and it's very destructive each time it does.

1:26:10.620 --> 1:26:13.100
 So it's not like, hey, freedom to come up

1:26:13.100 --> 1:26:16.460
 with any idea you want hasn't produced a whole lot of carnage.

1:26:16.460 --> 1:26:18.580
 But the question is, over time,

1:26:18.580 --> 1:26:23.100
 does it produce more open, fairer, more decent societies?

1:26:23.100 --> 1:26:24.580
 And I believe that it does.

1:26:24.580 --> 1:26:27.620
 I can't prove it, but that does seem to be the pattern.

1:26:27.620 --> 1:26:29.660
 I believe so as well.

1:26:29.660 --> 1:26:34.660
 The thing is, in the short term, freedom of speech,

1:26:35.100 --> 1:26:38.740
 absolute freedom of speech can be quite destructive.

1:26:38.740 --> 1:26:42.580
 But you nevertheless have to hold on to that,

1:26:42.580 --> 1:26:46.860
 because in the long term, I think you and I, I guess,

1:26:46.860 --> 1:26:50.500
 are optimistic in the sense that good ideas will win out.

1:26:51.500 --> 1:26:54.780
 I don't know how strongly I believe that it will work,

1:26:54.780 --> 1:26:56.620
 but I will say I haven't heard a better idea.

1:26:56.620 --> 1:27:01.620
 I would also point out that there's something

1:27:01.780 --> 1:27:06.340
 very significant in this question of the hubris involved

1:27:06.340 --> 1:27:08.980
 in imagining that you're going to improve the discussion

1:27:08.980 --> 1:27:13.980
 by censoring, which is the majority of concepts

1:27:14.540 --> 1:27:16.860
 at the fringe are nonsense.

1:27:18.300 --> 1:27:19.580
 That's automatic.

1:27:19.580 --> 1:27:23.260
 But the heterodoxy at the fringe,

1:27:23.260 --> 1:27:25.980
 which is indistinguishable at the beginning

1:27:25.980 --> 1:27:30.340
 from the nonsense ideas, is the key to progress.

1:27:30.340 --> 1:27:34.220
 So if you decide, hey, the fringe is 99% garbage,

1:27:34.220 --> 1:27:35.860
 let's just get rid of it, right?

1:27:35.860 --> 1:27:36.900
 Hey, that's a strong win.

1:27:36.900 --> 1:27:40.620
 We're getting rid of 99% garbage for 1% something or other.

1:27:40.620 --> 1:27:42.740
 And the point is, yeah, but that 1% something or other

1:27:42.740 --> 1:27:43.820
 is the key.

1:27:43.820 --> 1:27:45.500
 You're throwing out the key.

1:27:45.500 --> 1:27:48.380
 And so that's what YouTube is doing.

1:27:48.380 --> 1:27:50.900
 Frankly, I think at the point that it started censoring

1:27:50.900 --> 1:27:53.900
 my channel, in the immediate aftermath

1:27:53.900 --> 1:27:56.660
 of this major reversal over LabLeak,

1:27:56.660 --> 1:27:57.900
 it should have looked at itself and said,

1:27:57.900 --> 1:27:59.500
 well, what the hell are we doing?

1:27:59.500 --> 1:28:00.340
 Who are we censoring?

1:28:00.340 --> 1:28:03.260
 We're censoring somebody who was just right, right?

1:28:03.260 --> 1:28:05.300
 In a conflict with the very same people

1:28:05.300 --> 1:28:07.540
 on whose behalf we are now censoring, right?

1:28:07.540 --> 1:28:09.380
 That should have caused them to wake up.

1:28:09.380 --> 1:28:11.420
 So you said one approach, if you're on YouTube,

1:28:11.420 --> 1:28:15.540
 is this basically let all videos go

1:28:15.540 --> 1:28:16.900
 that do not violate the law.

1:28:16.900 --> 1:28:18.500
 Well, I should fix that, okay?

1:28:18.500 --> 1:28:20.700
 I believe that that is the basic principle.

1:28:20.700 --> 1:28:23.460
 Eric makes an excellent point about the distinction

1:28:23.460 --> 1:28:26.740
 between ideas and personal attacks,

1:28:26.740 --> 1:28:28.420
 doxxing, these other things.

1:28:28.420 --> 1:28:31.420
 So I agree, there's no value in allowing people

1:28:31.420 --> 1:28:33.180
 to destroy each other's lives,

1:28:33.180 --> 1:28:36.780
 even if there's a technical legal defense for it.

1:28:36.780 --> 1:28:39.100
 Now, how you draw that line, I don't know.

1:28:39.100 --> 1:28:41.620
 But what I'm talking about is,

1:28:41.620 --> 1:28:44.060
 yes, people should be free to traffic in bad ideas,

1:28:44.060 --> 1:28:47.140
 and they should be free to expose that the ideas are bad.

1:28:47.140 --> 1:28:49.020
 And hopefully that process results

1:28:49.020 --> 1:28:50.620
 in better ideas winning out.

1:28:50.620 --> 1:28:55.260
 Yeah, there's an interesting line between ideas,

1:28:55.260 --> 1:28:56.620
 like the earth is flat,

1:28:56.620 --> 1:28:59.980
 which I believe you should not censor.

1:28:59.980 --> 1:29:04.380
 And then you start to encroach on personal attacks.

1:29:04.380 --> 1:29:08.460
 So not doxxing, yes, but not even getting to that.

1:29:08.460 --> 1:29:10.700
 There's a certain point where it's like,

1:29:10.700 --> 1:29:13.420
 that's no longer ideas, that's more,

1:29:15.380 --> 1:29:18.460
 that's somehow not productive, even if it's wrong.

1:29:18.460 --> 1:29:20.900
 It feels like believing the earth is flat

1:29:20.900 --> 1:29:22.380
 is somehow productive,

1:29:22.380 --> 1:29:25.780
 because maybe there's a tiny percent chance it is.

1:29:27.420 --> 1:29:31.380
 It just feels like personal attacks, it doesn't,

1:29:31.380 --> 1:29:33.420
 well, I'm torn on this

1:29:33.420 --> 1:29:36.060
 because there's assholes in this world,

1:29:36.060 --> 1:29:37.780
 there's fraudulent people in this world.

1:29:37.780 --> 1:29:40.740
 So sometimes personal attacks are useful to reveal that,

1:29:41.780 --> 1:29:44.780
 but there's a line you can cross.

1:29:44.780 --> 1:29:48.460
 There's a comedy where people make fun of others.

1:29:48.460 --> 1:29:50.820
 I think that's amazing, that's very powerful,

1:29:50.820 --> 1:29:53.180
 and that's very useful, even if it's painful.

1:29:53.180 --> 1:29:55.820
 But then there's like, once it gets to be,

1:29:57.420 --> 1:29:58.460
 yeah, there's a certain line,

1:29:58.460 --> 1:30:00.140
 it's a gray area where you cross,

1:30:00.140 --> 1:30:04.940
 where it's no longer in any possible world productive.

1:30:04.940 --> 1:30:07.660
 And that's a really weird gray area

1:30:07.660 --> 1:30:09.260
 for YouTube to operate in.

1:30:09.260 --> 1:30:12.620
 And that feels like it should be a crowdsource thing,

1:30:12.620 --> 1:30:13.820
 where people vote on it.

1:30:13.820 --> 1:30:16.540
 But then again, do you trust the majority to vote

1:30:16.540 --> 1:30:19.060
 on what is crossing the line and not?

1:30:19.060 --> 1:30:21.100
 I mean, this is where,

1:30:21.100 --> 1:30:24.180
 this is really interesting on this particular,

1:30:24.180 --> 1:30:27.220
 like the scientific aspect of this.

1:30:27.220 --> 1:30:30.980
 Do you think YouTube should take more of a stance,

1:30:30.980 --> 1:30:35.780
 not censoring, but to actually have scientists

1:30:35.780 --> 1:30:39.020
 within YouTube having these kinds of discussions,

1:30:39.020 --> 1:30:42.180
 and then be able to almost speak out in a transparent way,

1:30:42.180 --> 1:30:45.180
 this is what we're going to let this video stand,

1:30:45.180 --> 1:30:47.580
 but here's all these other opinions.

1:30:47.580 --> 1:30:49.820
 Almost like take a more active role

1:30:49.820 --> 1:30:52.460
 in its recommendation system,

1:30:52.460 --> 1:30:55.420
 in trying to present a full picture to you.

1:30:55.420 --> 1:30:57.180
 Right now they're not,

1:30:57.180 --> 1:31:01.020
 the recommender systems are not human fine tuned.

1:31:01.020 --> 1:31:03.100
 They're all based on how you click,

1:31:03.100 --> 1:31:05.460
 and there's this clustering algorithms.

1:31:05.460 --> 1:31:07.180
 They're not taking an active role

1:31:07.180 --> 1:31:09.580
 on giving you the full spectrum of ideas

1:31:09.580 --> 1:31:11.060
 in the space of science.

1:31:11.060 --> 1:31:12.980
 They just censor or not.

1:31:12.980 --> 1:31:15.020
 Well, at the moment,

1:31:15.020 --> 1:31:17.260
 it's gonna be pretty hard to compel me

1:31:17.260 --> 1:31:18.820
 that these people should be trusted

1:31:18.820 --> 1:31:22.500
 with any sort of curation or comment

1:31:22.500 --> 1:31:24.700
 on matters of evidence,

1:31:24.700 --> 1:31:26.060
 because they have demonstrated

1:31:26.060 --> 1:31:28.060
 that they are incapable of doing it well.

1:31:29.340 --> 1:31:30.900
 You could make such an argument,

1:31:30.900 --> 1:31:34.260
 and I guess I'm open to the idea of institutions

1:31:34.260 --> 1:31:36.300
 that would look something like YouTube,

1:31:36.300 --> 1:31:39.060
 that would be capable of offering something valuable.

1:31:39.060 --> 1:31:41.300
 I mean, and even just the fact of them

1:31:41.300 --> 1:31:43.700
 literally curating things and putting some videos

1:31:43.700 --> 1:31:47.580
 next to others implies something.

1:31:47.580 --> 1:31:49.540
 So yeah, there's a question to be answered,

1:31:49.540 --> 1:31:51.700
 but at the moment, no.

1:31:51.700 --> 1:31:53.300
 At the moment, what it is doing

1:31:53.300 --> 1:31:57.300
 is quite literally putting not only individual humans

1:31:57.300 --> 1:32:00.700
 in tremendous jeopardy by censoring discussion

1:32:00.700 --> 1:32:04.460
 of useful tools and making tools that are more hazardous

1:32:04.460 --> 1:32:07.420
 than has been acknowledged seem safe, right?

1:32:07.420 --> 1:32:10.540
 But it is also placing humanity in danger

1:32:10.540 --> 1:32:13.580
 of a permanent relationship with this pathogen.

1:32:13.580 --> 1:32:16.820
 I cannot emphasize enough how expensive that is.

1:32:16.820 --> 1:32:18.820
 It's effectively incalculable.

1:32:18.820 --> 1:32:20.500
 If the relationship becomes permanent,

1:32:20.500 --> 1:32:23.100
 the number of people who will ultimately suffer

1:32:23.100 --> 1:32:26.100
 and die from it is indefinitely large.

1:32:26.100 --> 1:32:30.220
 Yeah, currently the algorithm is very rabbit hole driven,

1:32:30.220 --> 1:32:35.220
 meaning if you click on Flat Earth videos,

1:32:35.220 --> 1:32:38.580
 that's all you're going to be presented with

1:32:38.580 --> 1:32:40.980
 and you're not going to be nicely presented

1:32:40.980 --> 1:32:42.900
 with arguments against the Flat Earth.

1:32:42.900 --> 1:32:44.580
 And the flip side of that,

1:32:46.740 --> 1:32:48.580
 if you watch like quantum mechanics videos

1:32:48.580 --> 1:32:50.820
 or no, general relativity videos,

1:32:50.820 --> 1:32:53.180
 it's very rare you're going to get a recommendation.

1:32:53.180 --> 1:32:54.980
 Have you considered the Earth is flat?

1:32:54.980 --> 1:32:56.580
 And I think you should have both.

1:32:57.540 --> 1:32:58.980
 Same with vaccine.

1:32:58.980 --> 1:33:01.660
 Videos that present the power and the incredible

1:33:01.660 --> 1:33:06.660
 like biology, genetics, virology about the vaccine,

1:33:06.700 --> 1:33:09.820
 you're rarely going to get videos

1:33:09.820 --> 1:33:14.420
 from well respected scientific minds

1:33:14.420 --> 1:33:16.700
 presenting possible dangers of the vaccine.

1:33:16.700 --> 1:33:19.140
 And the vice versa is true as well,

1:33:19.140 --> 1:33:22.060
 which is if you're looking at the dangers of the vaccine

1:33:22.060 --> 1:33:25.620
 on YouTube, you're not going to get the highest quality

1:33:25.620 --> 1:33:27.140
 of videos recommended to you.

1:33:27.140 --> 1:33:30.860
 And I'm not talking about like manually inserted CDC videos

1:33:30.860 --> 1:33:33.700
 that are like the most untrustworthy things

1:33:33.700 --> 1:33:35.980
 you can possibly watch about how everybody

1:33:35.980 --> 1:33:38.380
 should take the vaccine, it's the safest thing ever.

1:33:38.380 --> 1:33:42.060
 No, it's about incredible, again, MIT colleagues of mine,

1:33:42.060 --> 1:33:45.300
 incredible biologists, virologists that talk about

1:33:45.300 --> 1:33:49.100
 the details of how the mRNA vaccines work

1:33:49.100 --> 1:33:50.500
 and all those kinds of things.

1:33:50.500 --> 1:33:55.460
 I think maybe this is me with the AI hat on,

1:33:55.460 --> 1:33:58.100
 is I think the algorithm can fix a lot of this

1:33:58.100 --> 1:34:00.500
 and YouTube should build better algorithms

1:34:00.500 --> 1:34:05.500
 and trust that to a couple of complete freedom of speech

1:34:06.340 --> 1:34:10.860
 to expand what people are able to think about,

1:34:10.860 --> 1:34:12.500
 present always varied views,

1:34:12.500 --> 1:34:16.300
 not balanced in some artificial way, hard coded way,

1:34:16.300 --> 1:34:18.740
 but balanced in a way that's crowdsourced.

1:34:18.740 --> 1:34:21.500
 I think that's an algorithm problem that can be solved

1:34:21.500 --> 1:34:25.460
 because then you can delegate it to the algorithm

1:34:25.460 --> 1:34:29.580
 as opposed to this hard code censorship

1:34:29.580 --> 1:34:34.300
 of basically creating artificial boundaries

1:34:34.300 --> 1:34:36.140
 on what can and can't be discussed,

1:34:36.140 --> 1:34:39.860
 instead creating a full spectrum of exploration

1:34:39.860 --> 1:34:43.220
 that can be done and trusting the intelligence of people

1:34:43.220 --> 1:34:45.340
 to do the exploration.

1:34:45.340 --> 1:34:47.060
 Well, there's a lot there.

1:34:47.060 --> 1:34:49.260
 I would say we have to keep in mind

1:34:49.260 --> 1:34:53.660
 that we're talking about a publicly held company

1:34:53.660 --> 1:34:55.900
 with shareholders and obligations to them

1:34:55.900 --> 1:34:57.860
 and that that may make it impossible.

1:34:57.860 --> 1:35:01.540
 And I remember many years ago,

1:35:01.540 --> 1:35:03.820
 back in the early days of Google,

1:35:03.820 --> 1:35:08.820
 I remember a sense of terror at the loss of general search.

1:35:10.780 --> 1:35:14.220
 It used to be that Google, if you searched,

1:35:14.220 --> 1:35:16.100
 came up with the same thing for everyone

1:35:16.100 --> 1:35:19.260
 and then it got personalized and for a while

1:35:19.260 --> 1:35:21.460
 it was possible to turn off the personalization,

1:35:21.460 --> 1:35:22.780
 which was still not great

1:35:22.780 --> 1:35:24.140
 because if everybody else is looking

1:35:24.140 --> 1:35:26.780
 at a personalized search and you can tune into one

1:35:26.780 --> 1:35:30.460
 that isn't personalized, that doesn't tell you

1:35:30.460 --> 1:35:33.020
 why the world is sounding the way it is.

1:35:33.020 --> 1:35:34.740
 But nonetheless, it was at least an option.

1:35:34.740 --> 1:35:35.940
 And then that vanished.

1:35:35.940 --> 1:35:40.020
 And the problem is I think this is literally deranging us.

1:35:40.020 --> 1:35:43.420
 That in effect, I mean, what you're describing

1:35:43.420 --> 1:35:44.380
 is unthinkable.

1:35:44.380 --> 1:35:48.180
 It is unthinkable that in the face of a campaign

1:35:48.180 --> 1:35:51.780
 to vaccinate people in order to reach herd immunity

1:35:51.780 --> 1:35:56.780
 that YouTube would give you videos on hazards of vaccines

1:35:59.060 --> 1:36:02.140
 when this is, how hazardous the vaccines are

1:36:02.140 --> 1:36:04.020
 is an unsettled question.

1:36:04.020 --> 1:36:06.020
 Why is it unthinkable?

1:36:06.020 --> 1:36:09.580
 That doesn't make any sense from a company perspective.

1:36:09.580 --> 1:36:14.580
 If intelligent people in large amounts are open minded

1:36:16.380 --> 1:36:19.100
 and are thinking through the hazards

1:36:19.100 --> 1:36:23.500
 and the benefits of a vaccine, a company should find

1:36:23.500 --> 1:36:28.500
 the best videos to present what people are thinking about.

1:36:28.740 --> 1:36:30.780
 Well, let's come up with a hypothetical.

1:36:30.780 --> 1:36:34.820
 Okay, let's come up with a very deadly disease

1:36:34.820 --> 1:36:37.780
 for which there's a vaccine that is very safe,

1:36:37.780 --> 1:36:40.060
 though not perfectly safe.

1:36:40.060 --> 1:36:43.940
 And we are then faced with YouTube trying to figure out

1:36:43.940 --> 1:36:47.300
 what to do for somebody searching on vaccine safety.

1:36:47.300 --> 1:36:50.140
 Suppose it is necessary in order to drive

1:36:50.140 --> 1:36:53.140
 the pathogen to extinction, something like smallpox,

1:36:53.140 --> 1:36:55.340
 that people get on board with the vaccine.

1:36:57.180 --> 1:36:59.740
 But there's a tiny fringe of people who thinks

1:36:59.740 --> 1:37:03.340
 that the vaccine is a mind control agent.

1:37:05.460 --> 1:37:10.460
 So should YouTube direct people to the only claims

1:37:11.340 --> 1:37:13.780
 against this vaccine, which is that it's a mind control

1:37:13.780 --> 1:37:18.780
 agent when in fact the vaccine is very safe,

1:37:20.980 --> 1:37:22.380
 whatever that means.

1:37:22.380 --> 1:37:25.500
 If that were the actual configuration of the puzzle,

1:37:25.500 --> 1:37:28.020
 then YouTube would be doing active harm,

1:37:28.020 --> 1:37:33.020
 pointing you to this other video potentially.

1:37:33.060 --> 1:37:36.340
 Now, yes, I would love to live in a world where people

1:37:36.340 --> 1:37:39.100
 are up to the challenge of sorting that out.

1:37:39.100 --> 1:37:42.780
 But my basic point would be, if it's an evidentiary

1:37:42.780 --> 1:37:45.820
 question, and there is essentially no evidence

1:37:45.820 --> 1:37:48.180
 that the vaccine is a mind control agent,

1:37:48.180 --> 1:37:50.780
 and there's plenty of evidence that the vaccine is safe,

1:37:50.780 --> 1:37:52.700
 then while you look for this video,

1:37:52.700 --> 1:37:55.340
 we're gonna give you this one, puts it on a par, right?

1:37:55.340 --> 1:37:59.140
 So for the mind that's tracking how much thought

1:37:59.140 --> 1:38:01.740
 is there behind it's safe versus how much thought

1:38:01.740 --> 1:38:04.340
 is there behind it's a mind control agent

1:38:04.340 --> 1:38:07.740
 will result in artificially elevating this.

1:38:07.740 --> 1:38:11.060
 Now in the current case, what we've seen is not this at all.

1:38:11.060 --> 1:38:15.380
 We have seen evidence obscured in order to create

1:38:15.380 --> 1:38:18.060
 a false story about safety.

1:38:18.060 --> 1:38:22.060
 And we saw the inverse with ivermectin.

1:38:22.060 --> 1:38:27.060
 We saw a campaign to portray the drug as more dangerous

1:38:27.780 --> 1:38:29.260
 and less effective than the evidence

1:38:29.260 --> 1:38:30.940
 clearly suggested it was.

1:38:30.940 --> 1:38:33.900
 So we're not talking about a comparable thing,

1:38:33.900 --> 1:38:36.060
 but I guess my point is the algorithmic solution

1:38:36.060 --> 1:38:39.740
 that you point to creates a problem of its own,

1:38:39.740 --> 1:38:42.820
 which is that it means that the way to get exposure

1:38:42.820 --> 1:38:44.700
 is to generate something fringy.

1:38:44.700 --> 1:38:46.860
 If you're the only thing on some fringe,

1:38:46.860 --> 1:38:49.700
 then suddenly YouTube would be recommending those things,

1:38:49.700 --> 1:38:53.140
 and that's obviously a gameable system at best.

1:38:53.140 --> 1:38:54.900
 Yeah, but the solution to that,

1:38:54.900 --> 1:38:57.580
 I know you're creating a thought experiment,

1:38:57.580 --> 1:39:00.780
 maybe playing a little bit of a devil's advocate.

1:39:00.780 --> 1:39:03.900
 I think the solution to that is not to limit the algorithm

1:39:03.900 --> 1:39:05.860
 in the case of the super deadly virus.

1:39:05.860 --> 1:39:08.260
 It's for the scientists to step up

1:39:08.260 --> 1:39:11.700
 and become better communicators, more charismatic,

1:39:11.700 --> 1:39:15.660
 fight the battle of ideas, sort of create better videos.

1:39:16.580 --> 1:39:19.220
 Like if the virus is truly deadly,

1:39:19.220 --> 1:39:22.060
 you have a lot more ammunition, a lot more data,

1:39:22.060 --> 1:39:23.700
 a lot more material to work with

1:39:23.700 --> 1:39:26.660
 in terms of communicating with the public.

1:39:26.660 --> 1:39:29.740
 So be better at communicating and stop being,

1:39:30.940 --> 1:39:33.740
 you have to start trusting the intelligence of people

1:39:33.740 --> 1:39:35.260
 and also being transparent

1:39:35.260 --> 1:39:37.140
 and playing the game of the internet,

1:39:37.140 --> 1:39:40.900
 which is like, what is the internet hungry for, I believe?

1:39:40.900 --> 1:39:44.660
 Authenticity, stop looking like you're full of shit.

1:39:46.220 --> 1:39:47.500
 The scientific community,

1:39:47.500 --> 1:39:50.500
 if there's any flaw that I currently see,

1:39:50.500 --> 1:39:53.060
 especially the people that are in public office,

1:39:53.060 --> 1:39:54.500
 that like Anthony Fauci,

1:39:54.500 --> 1:39:56.180
 they look like they're full of shit

1:39:56.180 --> 1:39:57.860
 and I know they're brilliant.

1:39:57.860 --> 1:39:59.900
 Why don't they look more authentic?

1:39:59.900 --> 1:40:01.380
 So they're losing that game

1:40:01.380 --> 1:40:05.100
 and I think a lot of people observing this entire system now,

1:40:05.100 --> 1:40:09.420
 younger scientists are seeing this and saying,

1:40:09.420 --> 1:40:12.580
 okay, if I want to continue being a scientist

1:40:12.580 --> 1:40:16.100
 in the public eye and I want to be effective at my job,

1:40:16.100 --> 1:40:18.140
 I'm gonna have to be a lot more authentic.

1:40:18.140 --> 1:40:19.300
 So they're learning the lesson,

1:40:19.300 --> 1:40:21.220
 this evolutionary system is working.

1:40:22.460 --> 1:40:25.220
 So there's just a younger generation of minds coming up

1:40:25.220 --> 1:40:27.100
 that I think will do a much better job

1:40:27.100 --> 1:40:28.620
 in this battle of ideas

1:40:28.620 --> 1:40:32.780
 that when the much more dangerous virus comes along,

1:40:32.780 --> 1:40:34.620
 they'll be able to be better communicators.

1:40:34.620 --> 1:40:35.860
 At least that's the hope.

1:40:36.820 --> 1:40:40.380
 Using the algorithm to control that is,

1:40:40.380 --> 1:40:41.820
 I feel like is a big problem.

1:40:41.820 --> 1:40:45.140
 So you're going to have the same problem with a deadly virus

1:40:45.140 --> 1:40:46.940
 as with the current virus

1:40:46.940 --> 1:40:50.340
 if you let YouTube draw hard lines

1:40:50.340 --> 1:40:52.780
 by the PR and the marketing people

1:40:52.780 --> 1:40:55.260
 versus the broad community of scientists.

1:40:56.180 --> 1:40:59.540
 Well, in some sense you're suggesting something

1:40:59.540 --> 1:41:01.300
 that's close kin to what I was saying

1:41:01.300 --> 1:41:05.700
 about freedom of expression ultimately

1:41:05.700 --> 1:41:07.700
 provides an advantage to better ideas.

1:41:07.700 --> 1:41:10.700
 So I'm in agreement broadly speaking,

1:41:10.700 --> 1:41:13.620
 but I would also say there's probably some sort of,

1:41:13.620 --> 1:41:15.540
 let's imagine the world that you propose

1:41:15.540 --> 1:41:18.540
 where YouTube shows you the alternative point of view.

1:41:19.740 --> 1:41:21.340
 That has the problem that I suggest,

1:41:21.340 --> 1:41:24.700
 but one thing you could do is you could give us the tools

1:41:24.700 --> 1:41:27.500
 to understand what we're looking at, right?

1:41:27.500 --> 1:41:28.340
 You could give us,

1:41:28.340 --> 1:41:32.900
 so first of all, there's something I think myopic,

1:41:32.900 --> 1:41:37.260
 solipsistic, narcissistic about an algorithm

1:41:37.260 --> 1:41:40.980
 that serves shareholders by showing you what you want to see

1:41:40.980 --> 1:41:42.820
 rather than what you need to know, right?

1:41:42.820 --> 1:41:45.820
 That's the distinction is flattering you,

1:41:45.820 --> 1:41:47.620
 playing to your blind spot

1:41:47.620 --> 1:41:49.700
 is something that algorithm will figure out,

1:41:49.700 --> 1:41:51.020
 but it's not healthy for us all

1:41:51.020 --> 1:41:53.460
 to have Google playing to our blind spot.

1:41:53.460 --> 1:41:54.660
 It's very, very dangerous.

1:41:54.660 --> 1:41:59.660
 So what I really want is analytics that allow me

1:41:59.940 --> 1:42:02.260
 or maybe options and analytics.

1:42:02.260 --> 1:42:05.260
 The options should allow me to see

1:42:05.260 --> 1:42:09.180
 what alternative perspectives are being explored, right?

1:42:09.180 --> 1:42:10.660
 So here's the thing I'm searching

1:42:10.660 --> 1:42:12.260
 and it leads me down this road, right?

1:42:12.260 --> 1:42:14.300
 Let's say it's ivermectin, okay?

1:42:14.300 --> 1:42:16.380
 I find all of this evidence that ivermectin works.

1:42:16.380 --> 1:42:17.540
 I find all of these discussions

1:42:17.540 --> 1:42:20.340
 and people talk about various protocols and this and that.

1:42:20.340 --> 1:42:24.260
 And then I could say, all right, what is the other side?

1:42:24.260 --> 1:42:28.860
 And I could see who is searching, not as individuals,

1:42:28.860 --> 1:42:32.340
 but what demographics are searching alternatives.

1:42:32.340 --> 1:42:33.900
 And maybe you could even combine it

1:42:33.900 --> 1:42:37.340
 with something Reddit like where effectively,

1:42:37.340 --> 1:42:40.940
 let's say that there was a position that, I don't know,

1:42:40.940 --> 1:42:44.260
 that a vaccine is a mind control device

1:42:44.260 --> 1:42:48.940
 and you could have a steel man this argument competition

1:42:48.940 --> 1:42:51.180
 effectively and the better answers that steel man

1:42:51.180 --> 1:42:53.340
 and as well as possible would rise to the top.

1:42:53.340 --> 1:42:56.460
 And so you could read the top three or four explanations

1:42:56.460 --> 1:43:01.220
 about why this really credibly is a mind control product.

1:43:01.220 --> 1:43:03.420
 And you can say, well, that doesn't really add up.

1:43:03.420 --> 1:43:05.100
 I can check these three things myself

1:43:05.100 --> 1:43:07.260
 and they can't possibly be right, right?

1:43:07.260 --> 1:43:08.220
 And you could dismiss it.

1:43:08.220 --> 1:43:10.060
 And then as an argument that was credible,

1:43:10.060 --> 1:43:12.740
 let's say plate tectonics before

1:43:12.740 --> 1:43:15.100
 that was an accepted concept,

1:43:15.100 --> 1:43:16.860
 you'd say, wait a minute,

1:43:16.860 --> 1:43:19.420
 there is evidence for plate tectonics.

1:43:19.420 --> 1:43:21.220
 As crazy as it sounds that the continents

1:43:21.220 --> 1:43:23.380
 are floating around on liquid,

1:43:23.380 --> 1:43:26.060
 actually that's not so implausible.

1:43:26.060 --> 1:43:27.940
 We've got these subduction zones,

1:43:27.940 --> 1:43:30.500
 we've got a geology that is compatible,

1:43:30.500 --> 1:43:31.940
 we've got puzzle piece continents

1:43:31.940 --> 1:43:33.180
 that seem to fit together.

1:43:33.180 --> 1:43:35.580
 Wow, that's a surprising amount of evidence

1:43:35.580 --> 1:43:36.420
 for that position.

1:43:36.420 --> 1:43:39.100
 So I'm gonna file some Bayesian probability with it

1:43:39.100 --> 1:43:40.780
 that's updated for the fact that actually

1:43:40.780 --> 1:43:43.580
 the steel man arguments better than I was expecting, right?

1:43:43.580 --> 1:43:45.060
 So I could imagine something like that

1:43:45.060 --> 1:43:48.020
 where A, I would love the search to be indifferent

1:43:48.020 --> 1:43:49.540
 to who's searching, right?

1:43:49.540 --> 1:43:51.940
 The solipsistic thing is too dangerous.

1:43:51.940 --> 1:43:53.540
 So the search could be general,

1:43:53.540 --> 1:43:54.620
 so we would all get a sense

1:43:54.620 --> 1:43:56.980
 for what everybody else was seeing too.

1:43:56.980 --> 1:43:59.420
 And then some layer that didn't have anything to do

1:43:59.420 --> 1:44:01.940
 with what YouTube points you to or not,

1:44:01.940 --> 1:44:04.300
 but allowed you to see, you know,

1:44:04.300 --> 1:44:08.060
 the general pattern of adherence

1:44:08.060 --> 1:44:11.740
 to searching for information.

1:44:11.740 --> 1:44:14.740
 And again, a layer in which those things could be defended.

1:44:14.740 --> 1:44:17.020
 So you could hear what a good argument sounded like

1:44:17.020 --> 1:44:19.260
 rather than just hear a caricatured argument.

1:44:19.260 --> 1:44:21.220
 Yeah, and also reward people,

1:44:21.220 --> 1:44:23.860
 creators that have demonstrated

1:44:23.860 --> 1:44:26.300
 like a track record of open mindedness

1:44:26.300 --> 1:44:29.540
 and correctness as much as it could be measured

1:44:29.540 --> 1:44:31.700
 over a long term and sort of,

1:44:33.460 --> 1:44:36.860
 I mean, a lot of this maps

1:44:36.860 --> 1:44:41.860
 to incentivizing good longterm behavior,

1:44:41.860 --> 1:44:48.860
 not immediate kind of dopamine rush kind of signals.

1:44:50.340 --> 1:44:55.340
 I think ultimately the algorithm on the individual level

1:44:55.860 --> 1:44:58.780
 should optimize for personal growth,

1:45:00.140 --> 1:45:04.780
 longterm happiness, just growth intellectually,

1:45:04.780 --> 1:45:07.580
 growth in terms of lifestyle personally and so on,

1:45:07.580 --> 1:45:10.420
 as opposed to immediate.

1:45:10.420 --> 1:45:12.300
 I think that's going to build a better society,

1:45:12.300 --> 1:45:13.500
 not even just like truth,

1:45:13.500 --> 1:45:16.180
 because I think truth is a complicated thing.

1:45:16.180 --> 1:45:19.300
 It's more just you growing as a person,

1:45:19.300 --> 1:45:23.220
 exploring the space of ideas, changing your mind often,

1:45:23.220 --> 1:45:25.380
 increasing the level to which you're open minded,

1:45:25.380 --> 1:45:28.020
 the knowledge base you're operating from,

1:45:28.020 --> 1:45:31.340
 the willingness to empathize with others,

1:45:31.340 --> 1:45:34.140
 all those kinds of things the algorithm should optimize for.

1:45:34.140 --> 1:45:37.060
 Like creating a better human at the individual level

1:45:37.060 --> 1:45:40.340
 that you're, I think that's a great business model

1:45:40.340 --> 1:45:44.780
 because the person that's using this tool

1:45:44.780 --> 1:45:47.340
 will then be happier with themselves for having used it

1:45:47.340 --> 1:45:50.780
 and will be a lifelong quote unquote customer.

1:45:50.780 --> 1:45:53.380
 I think it's a great business model

1:45:53.380 --> 1:45:57.020
 to make a happy, open minded, knowledgeable,

1:45:57.020 --> 1:45:58.460
 better human being.

1:45:58.460 --> 1:46:02.420
 It's a terrible business model under the current system.

1:46:02.420 --> 1:46:04.300
 What you want is to build the system

1:46:04.300 --> 1:46:05.620
 in which it is a great business model.

1:46:05.620 --> 1:46:07.660
 Why is it a terrible model?

1:46:07.660 --> 1:46:10.580
 Because it will be decimated by those

1:46:10.580 --> 1:46:11.940
 who play to the short term.

1:46:12.980 --> 1:46:14.340
 I don't think so.

1:46:14.340 --> 1:46:15.180
 Why?

1:46:15.180 --> 1:46:16.220
 I mean, I think we're living it.

1:46:16.220 --> 1:46:17.340
 We're living it.

1:46:17.340 --> 1:46:19.480
 Well, no, because if you have the alternative

1:46:19.480 --> 1:46:21.020
 that presents itself,

1:46:21.020 --> 1:46:24.020
 it points out the emperor has no clothes.

1:46:24.020 --> 1:46:27.340
 I mean, it points out that YouTube is operating in this way,

1:46:27.340 --> 1:46:29.220
 Twitter is operating in this way,

1:46:29.220 --> 1:46:30.720
 Facebook is operating in this way.

1:46:30.720 --> 1:46:35.020
 How long term would you like the wisdom to prove at?

1:46:35.020 --> 1:46:40.020
 Well, even a week is better when it's currently happening.

1:46:40.020 --> 1:46:42.180
 Right, but the problem is,

1:46:42.180 --> 1:46:45.540
 if a week loses out to an hour, right?

1:46:45.540 --> 1:46:48.220
 And I don't think it loses out.

1:46:48.220 --> 1:46:49.660
 It loses out in the short term.

1:46:49.660 --> 1:46:50.500
 That's my point.

1:46:50.500 --> 1:46:52.060
 At least you're a great communicator

1:46:52.060 --> 1:46:55.860
 and you basically say, look, here's the metrics.

1:46:55.860 --> 1:46:59.260
 And a lot of it is like how people actually feel.

1:46:59.260 --> 1:47:02.540
 Like this is what people experience with social media.

1:47:02.540 --> 1:47:04.940
 They look back at the previous month and say,

1:47:06.300 --> 1:47:09.140
 I felt shitty on a lot of days because of social media.

1:47:09.140 --> 1:47:09.980
 Right.

1:47:11.100 --> 1:47:14.660
 If you look back at the previous few weeks and say,

1:47:14.660 --> 1:47:18.500
 wow, I'm a better person because of that month happened.

1:47:18.500 --> 1:47:20.780
 That's, they immediately choose the product

1:47:20.780 --> 1:47:22.220
 that's going to lead to that.

1:47:22.220 --> 1:47:24.540
 That's what love for products looks like.

1:47:24.540 --> 1:47:28.300
 If you love, like a lot of people love their Tesla car,

1:47:28.300 --> 1:47:31.940
 like that's, or iPhone or like beautiful design.

1:47:31.940 --> 1:47:33.060
 That's what love looks like.

1:47:33.060 --> 1:47:35.340
 You look back, I'm a better person

1:47:35.340 --> 1:47:36.540
 for having used this thing.

1:47:36.540 --> 1:47:38.340
 Well, you got to ask yourself the question though,

1:47:38.340 --> 1:47:40.260
 if this is such a great business model,

1:47:40.260 --> 1:47:41.580
 why isn't it devolving?

1:47:42.620 --> 1:47:44.380
 Why don't we see it?

1:47:44.380 --> 1:47:46.300
 Honestly, it's competence.

1:47:46.300 --> 1:47:50.740
 It's like people are just, it's not easy to build new,

1:47:50.740 --> 1:47:55.540
 it's not easy to build products, tools, systems

1:47:55.540 --> 1:47:57.660
 on new ideas.

1:47:57.660 --> 1:47:59.100
 It's kind of a new idea.

1:47:59.100 --> 1:48:01.980
 We've gone through this, everything we're seeing now

1:48:02.900 --> 1:48:06.260
 comes from the ideas of the initial birth of the internet.

1:48:06.260 --> 1:48:08.180
 There just needs to be new sets of tools

1:48:08.180 --> 1:48:12.460
 that are incentivizing long term personal growth

1:48:12.460 --> 1:48:13.420
 and happiness.

1:48:13.420 --> 1:48:14.260
 That's it.

1:48:14.260 --> 1:48:16.540
 Right, but what we have is a market

1:48:16.540 --> 1:48:18.260
 that doesn't favor this, right?

1:48:18.260 --> 1:48:23.260
 I mean, for one thing, we had an alternative to Facebook,

1:48:23.580 --> 1:48:25.900
 right, that looked, you owned your own data,

1:48:25.900 --> 1:48:29.820
 it wasn't exploitative and Facebook bought

1:48:29.820 --> 1:48:32.460
 a huge interest in it and it died.

1:48:32.460 --> 1:48:34.860
 I mean, who do you know who's on diaspora?

1:48:34.860 --> 1:48:37.460
 The execution there was not good.

1:48:37.460 --> 1:48:40.340
 Right, but it could have gotten better, right?

1:48:40.340 --> 1:48:43.820
 I don't think that the argument that why hasn't somebody

1:48:43.820 --> 1:48:47.300
 done it a good argument for it's not going to completely

1:48:47.300 --> 1:48:51.060
 destroy all of Twitter and Facebook when somebody does it

1:48:51.060 --> 1:48:54.660
 or Twitter will catch up and pivot to the algorithm.

1:48:54.660 --> 1:48:56.340
 This is not what I'm saying.

1:48:56.340 --> 1:48:59.820
 There's obviously great ideas that remain unexplored

1:48:59.820 --> 1:49:01.700
 because nobody has gotten to the foothill

1:49:01.700 --> 1:49:03.060
 that would allow you to explore them.

1:49:03.060 --> 1:49:05.460
 That's true, but you know, an internet

1:49:05.460 --> 1:49:08.700
 that was non predatory is an obvious idea

1:49:08.700 --> 1:49:10.900
 and many of us know that we want it

1:49:10.900 --> 1:49:13.460
 and many of us have seen prototypes of it

1:49:13.460 --> 1:49:15.580
 and we don't move because there's no audience there.

1:49:15.580 --> 1:49:17.680
 So the network effects cause you to stay

1:49:17.680 --> 1:49:19.860
 with the predatory internet.

1:49:19.860 --> 1:49:24.460
 But let me just, I wasn't kidding about build the system

1:49:24.460 --> 1:49:27.620
 in which your idea is a great business plan.

1:49:28.700 --> 1:49:32.620
 So in our upcoming book, Heather and I in our last chapter

1:49:32.620 --> 1:49:34.780
 explore something called the fourth frontier

1:49:34.780 --> 1:49:38.340
 and fourth frontier has to do with sort of a 2.0 version

1:49:38.340 --> 1:49:40.500
 of civilization, which we freely admit

1:49:40.500 --> 1:49:42.420
 we can't tell you very much about.

1:49:42.420 --> 1:49:44.060
 It's something that would have to be,

1:49:44.060 --> 1:49:45.660
 we would have to prototype our way there.

1:49:45.660 --> 1:49:48.220
 We would have to effectively navigate our way there.

1:49:48.220 --> 1:49:49.760
 But the result would be very much

1:49:49.760 --> 1:49:51.020
 like what you're describing.

1:49:51.020 --> 1:49:54.740
 It would be something that effectively liberates humans

1:49:54.740 --> 1:49:57.860
 meaningfully and most importantly,

1:49:57.860 --> 1:50:02.220
 it has to feel like growth without depending on growth.

1:50:02.220 --> 1:50:05.140
 In other words, human beings are creatures

1:50:05.140 --> 1:50:07.140
 that like every other creature

1:50:07.140 --> 1:50:09.700
 is effectively looking for growth, right?

1:50:09.700 --> 1:50:11.580
 We are looking for underexploited

1:50:11.580 --> 1:50:14.860
 or unexploited opportunities and when we find them,

1:50:14.860 --> 1:50:18.260
 our ancestors for example, they happen into a new valley

1:50:18.260 --> 1:50:20.660
 that was unexplored by people.

1:50:20.660 --> 1:50:23.300
 Their population would grow until it hit carrying capacity.

1:50:23.300 --> 1:50:25.660
 So there would be this great feeling of there's abundance

1:50:25.660 --> 1:50:27.940
 until you hit carrying capacity, which is inevitable

1:50:27.940 --> 1:50:30.500
 and then zero sum dynamics would set in.

1:50:30.500 --> 1:50:34.040
 So in order for human beings to flourish longterm,

1:50:34.040 --> 1:50:37.900
 the way to get there is to satisfy the desire for growth

1:50:37.900 --> 1:50:39.680
 without hooking it to actual growth,

1:50:39.680 --> 1:50:42.420
 which only moves and fits and starts.

1:50:42.420 --> 1:50:45.340
 And this is actually, I believe the key

1:50:45.340 --> 1:50:48.940
 to avoiding these spasms of human tragedy

1:50:48.940 --> 1:50:50.660
 when in the absence of growth,

1:50:50.660 --> 1:50:54.100
 people do something that causes their population

1:50:54.100 --> 1:50:57.780
 to experience growth, which is they go and make war on

1:50:57.780 --> 1:50:59.980
 or commit genocide against some other population,

1:50:59.980 --> 1:51:02.960
 which is something we obviously have to stop.

1:51:02.960 --> 1:51:06.080
 By the way, this is a hunter gatherers guide

1:51:06.080 --> 1:51:08.420
 to the 21st century coauthored.

1:51:08.420 --> 1:51:09.260
 That's right.

1:51:09.260 --> 1:51:11.220
 With your wife, Heather, being released in September.

1:51:11.220 --> 1:51:13.620
 I believe you said you're going to do

1:51:13.620 --> 1:51:16.100
 a little bit of a preview videos on each chapter

1:51:16.100 --> 1:51:17.260
 leading up to the release.

1:51:17.260 --> 1:51:19.740
 So I'm looking forward to the last chapter

1:51:19.740 --> 1:51:23.140
 as well as all the previous ones.

1:51:23.140 --> 1:51:24.620
 I have a few questions on that.

1:51:24.620 --> 1:51:29.620
 So you generally have faith to clarify that technology

1:51:30.340 --> 1:51:35.340
 could be the thing that empowers this kind of future.

1:51:36.380 --> 1:51:40.540
 Well, if you just let technology evolve,

1:51:40.540 --> 1:51:43.580
 it's going to be our undoing, right?

1:51:43.580 --> 1:51:48.280
 One of the things that I fault my libertarian friends for

1:51:48.280 --> 1:51:51.360
 is this faith that the market is going to find solutions

1:51:51.360 --> 1:51:52.580
 without destroying us.

1:51:52.580 --> 1:51:56.220
 And my sense is I'm a very strong believer in markets.

1:51:56.220 --> 1:51:57.700
 I believe in their power

1:51:57.700 --> 1:52:00.280
 even above some market fundamentalists.

1:52:00.280 --> 1:52:03.980
 But what I don't believe is that they should be allowed

1:52:03.980 --> 1:52:06.400
 to plot our course, right?

1:52:06.400 --> 1:52:09.940
 Markets are very good at figuring out how to do things.

1:52:09.940 --> 1:52:12.140
 They are not good at all about figuring out

1:52:12.140 --> 1:52:13.660
 what we should do, right?

1:52:13.660 --> 1:52:14.900
 What we should want.

1:52:14.900 --> 1:52:16.660
 We have to tell markets what we want

1:52:16.660 --> 1:52:19.060
 and then they can tell us how to do it best.

1:52:19.060 --> 1:52:22.980
 And if we adopted that kind of pro market

1:52:22.980 --> 1:52:25.780
 but in a context where it's not steering,

1:52:25.780 --> 1:52:28.900
 where human wellbeing is actually the driver,

1:52:28.900 --> 1:52:30.920
 we can do remarkable things.

1:52:30.920 --> 1:52:32.300
 And the technology that emerges

1:52:32.300 --> 1:52:35.420
 would naturally be enhancing of human wellbeing.

1:52:35.420 --> 1:52:36.340
 Perfectly so?

1:52:36.340 --> 1:52:38.720
 No, but overwhelmingly so.

1:52:38.720 --> 1:52:40.860
 But at the moment, markets are finding

1:52:40.860 --> 1:52:43.660
 our every defective character and exploiting them

1:52:43.660 --> 1:52:44.940
 and making huge profits

1:52:44.940 --> 1:52:48.260
 and making us worse to each other in the process.

1:52:49.760 --> 1:52:52.500
 Before we leave COVID 19,

1:52:52.500 --> 1:52:56.400
 let me ask you about a very difficult topic,

1:52:57.580 --> 1:52:59.280
 which is the vaccines.

1:53:00.380 --> 1:53:03.840
 So I took the Pfizer vaccine, the two shots.

1:53:05.300 --> 1:53:06.300
 You did not.

1:53:07.160 --> 1:53:10.500
 You have been taking ivermectin.

1:53:10.500 --> 1:53:11.340
 Yep.

1:53:12.580 --> 1:53:15.060
 So one of the arguments

1:53:15.060 --> 1:53:17.540
 against the discussion of ivermectin

1:53:17.540 --> 1:53:21.140
 is that it prevents people

1:53:21.140 --> 1:53:24.980
 from being fully willing to get the vaccine.

1:53:24.980 --> 1:53:27.820
 How would you compare ivermectin

1:53:27.820 --> 1:53:30.540
 and the vaccine for COVID 19?

1:53:31.660 --> 1:53:33.380
 All right, that's a good question.

1:53:33.380 --> 1:53:34.620
 I would say, first of all,

1:53:34.620 --> 1:53:37.100
 there are some hazards with the vaccine

1:53:37.100 --> 1:53:38.500
 that people need to be aware of.

1:53:38.500 --> 1:53:41.300
 There are some things that we cannot rule out

1:53:41.300 --> 1:53:44.420
 and for which there is some evidence.

1:53:44.420 --> 1:53:46.780
 The two that I think people should be tracking

1:53:46.780 --> 1:53:50.780
 is the possibility, some would say a likelihood,

1:53:50.780 --> 1:53:53.640
 that a vaccine of this nature,

1:53:53.640 --> 1:53:58.640
 that is to say very narrowly focused on a single antigen,

1:53:58.940 --> 1:54:02.380
 is an evolutionary pressure

1:54:02.380 --> 1:54:05.100
 that will drive the emergence of variants

1:54:05.100 --> 1:54:06.620
 that will escape the protection

1:54:06.620 --> 1:54:08.740
 that comes from the vaccine.

1:54:08.740 --> 1:54:11.660
 So this is a hazard.

1:54:11.660 --> 1:54:14.020
 It is a particular hazard in light of the fact

1:54:14.020 --> 1:54:16.800
 that these vaccines have a substantial number

1:54:16.800 --> 1:54:18.900
 of breakthrough cases.

1:54:18.900 --> 1:54:22.520
 So one danger is that a person who has been vaccinated

1:54:22.520 --> 1:54:27.520
 will shed viruses that are specifically less visible

1:54:27.620 --> 1:54:30.720
 or invisible to the immunity created by the vaccines.

1:54:31.900 --> 1:54:34.260
 So we may be creating the next pandemic

1:54:34.260 --> 1:54:37.340
 by applying the pressure of vaccines

1:54:37.340 --> 1:54:39.440
 at a point that it doesn't make sense to.

1:54:40.720 --> 1:54:42.580
 The other danger has to do with something called

1:54:42.580 --> 1:54:45.260
 antibody dependent enhancement,

1:54:45.260 --> 1:54:47.200
 which is something that we see in certain diseases

1:54:47.200 --> 1:54:48.760
 like dengue fever.

1:54:48.760 --> 1:54:51.680
 You may know that dengue, one gets a case,

1:54:51.680 --> 1:54:54.100
 and then their second case is much more devastating.

1:54:54.100 --> 1:54:57.260
 So break bone fever is when you get your second case

1:54:57.260 --> 1:55:00.760
 of dengue, and dengue effectively utilizes

1:55:00.760 --> 1:55:04.620
 the immune response that is produced by prior exposure

1:55:04.620 --> 1:55:06.900
 to attack the body in ways that it is incapable

1:55:06.900 --> 1:55:08.860
 of doing before exposure.

1:55:08.860 --> 1:55:12.020
 So this is apparently, this pattern has apparently blocked

1:55:12.020 --> 1:55:17.020
 past efforts to make vaccines against coronaviruses.

1:55:17.420 --> 1:55:19.240
 Whether it will happen here or not,

1:55:19.240 --> 1:55:20.460
 it is still too early to say.

1:55:20.460 --> 1:55:22.780
 But before we even get to the question

1:55:22.780 --> 1:55:26.940
 of harm done to individuals by these vaccines,

1:55:26.940 --> 1:55:29.660
 we have to ask about what the overall impact is going to be.

1:55:29.660 --> 1:55:32.260
 And it's not clear in the way people think it is

1:55:32.260 --> 1:55:35.460
 that if we vaccinate enough people, the pandemic will end.

1:55:35.460 --> 1:55:37.040
 It could be that we vaccinate people

1:55:37.040 --> 1:55:38.700
 and make the pandemic worse.

1:55:38.700 --> 1:55:40.600
 And while nobody can say for sure

1:55:40.600 --> 1:55:42.080
 that that's where we're headed,

1:55:42.080 --> 1:55:43.860
 it is at least something to be aware of.

1:55:43.860 --> 1:55:46.160
 So don't vaccines usually create

1:55:46.160 --> 1:55:48.940
 that kind of evolutionary pressure

1:55:48.940 --> 1:55:53.000
 to create deadlier, different strains of the virus?

1:55:55.160 --> 1:55:58.740
 So is there something particular with these mRNA vaccines

1:55:58.740 --> 1:56:01.380
 that's uniquely dangerous in this regard?

1:56:01.380 --> 1:56:03.440
 Well, it's not even just the mRNA vaccines.

1:56:03.440 --> 1:56:07.140
 The mRNA vaccines and the adenovector DNA vaccine

1:56:07.140 --> 1:56:09.060
 all share the same vulnerability,

1:56:09.060 --> 1:56:11.220
 which is they are very narrowly focused

1:56:11.220 --> 1:56:14.180
 on one subunit of the spike protein.

1:56:14.180 --> 1:56:18.180
 So that is a very concentrated evolutionary signal.

1:56:18.180 --> 1:56:20.900
 We are also deploying it in mid pandemic

1:56:20.900 --> 1:56:23.460
 and it takes time for immunity to develop.

1:56:23.460 --> 1:56:25.760
 So part of the problem here,

1:56:25.760 --> 1:56:29.740
 if you inoculated a population before encounter

1:56:29.740 --> 1:56:32.940
 with a pathogen, then there might be substantially

1:56:32.940 --> 1:56:37.300
 enough immunity to prevent this phenomenon from happening.

1:56:37.300 --> 1:56:40.440
 But in this case, we are inoculating people

1:56:40.440 --> 1:56:43.980
 as they are encountering those who are sick with the disease.

1:56:43.980 --> 1:56:47.320
 And what that means is the disease is now faced

1:56:47.320 --> 1:56:48.560
 with a lot of opportunities

1:56:48.560 --> 1:56:52.420
 to effectively evolutionarily practice escape strategies.

1:56:52.420 --> 1:56:54.660
 So one thing is the timing,

1:56:54.660 --> 1:56:56.780
 the other thing is the narrow focus.

1:56:56.780 --> 1:56:58.360
 Now in a traditional vaccine,

1:56:58.360 --> 1:57:01.200
 you would typically not have one antigen, right?

1:57:01.200 --> 1:57:04.300
 You would have basically a virus full of antigens

1:57:04.300 --> 1:57:06.100
 and the immune system would therefore

1:57:06.100 --> 1:57:08.100
 produce a broader response.

1:57:08.100 --> 1:57:11.860
 So that is the case for people who have had COVID, right?

1:57:11.860 --> 1:57:13.360
 They have an immunity that is broader

1:57:13.360 --> 1:57:14.860
 because it wasn't so focused

1:57:14.860 --> 1:57:17.060
 on one part of the spike protein.

1:57:17.060 --> 1:57:19.220
 So anyway, there is something unique here.

1:57:19.220 --> 1:57:21.820
 So these platforms create that special hazard.

1:57:21.820 --> 1:57:25.300
 They also have components that we haven't used before

1:57:25.300 --> 1:57:26.140
 in people.

1:57:26.140 --> 1:57:28.240
 So for example, the lipid nanoparticles

1:57:28.240 --> 1:57:32.580
 that coat the RNAs are distributing themselves

1:57:32.580 --> 1:57:36.280
 around the body in a way that will have unknown consequences.

1:57:37.500 --> 1:57:40.180
 So anyway, there's reason for concern.

1:57:40.180 --> 1:57:45.020
 Is it possible for you to steel man the argument

1:57:45.020 --> 1:57:48.020
 that everybody should get vaccinated?

1:57:48.020 --> 1:57:49.060
 Of course.

1:57:49.060 --> 1:57:51.380
 The argument that everybody should get vaccinated

1:57:51.380 --> 1:57:54.660
 is that nothing is perfectly safe.

1:57:54.660 --> 1:57:59.580
 Phase three trials showed good safety for the vaccines.

1:57:59.580 --> 1:58:01.980
 Now that may or may not be actually true,

1:58:01.980 --> 1:58:05.980
 but what we saw suggested high degree of efficacy

1:58:05.980 --> 1:58:09.780
 and a high degree of safety for the vaccines

1:58:09.780 --> 1:58:11.780
 that inoculating people quickly

1:58:11.780 --> 1:58:15.700
 and therefore dropping the landscape of available victims

1:58:15.700 --> 1:58:19.400
 for the pathogen to a very low number

1:58:19.400 --> 1:58:22.020
 so that herd immunity drives it to extinction

1:58:22.020 --> 1:58:24.580
 requires us all to take our share of the risk

1:58:25.540 --> 1:58:30.380
 and that because driving it to extinction

1:58:30.380 --> 1:58:32.460
 should be our highest priority that really

1:58:32.460 --> 1:58:36.680
 people shouldn't think too much about the various nuances

1:58:36.680 --> 1:58:39.700
 because overwhelmingly fewer people will die

1:58:39.700 --> 1:58:43.180
 if the population is vaccinated from the vaccine

1:58:43.180 --> 1:58:45.340
 than will die from COVID if they're not vaccinated.

1:58:45.340 --> 1:58:48.180
 And with the vaccine as it currently is being deployed,

1:58:48.180 --> 1:58:50.380
 that is a quite a likely scenario

1:58:51.300 --> 1:58:56.300
 that everything, you know, the virus will fade away.

1:58:58.340 --> 1:59:01.500
 In the following sense that the probability

1:59:01.500 --> 1:59:05.980
 that a more dangerous strain will be created is nonzero,

1:59:05.980 --> 1:59:10.140
 but it's not 50%, it's something smaller.

1:59:10.140 --> 1:59:11.900
 And so the most likely, well, I don't know,

1:59:11.900 --> 1:59:12.800
 maybe you disagree with that,

1:59:12.800 --> 1:59:15.620
 but the scenario we're most likely to see now

1:59:15.620 --> 1:59:19.140
 that the vaccine is here is that the virus,

1:59:19.140 --> 1:59:21.620
 the effects of the virus will fade away.

1:59:21.620 --> 1:59:23.520
 First of all, I don't believe that the probability

1:59:23.520 --> 1:59:27.380
 of creating a worse pandemic is low enough to discount.

1:59:27.380 --> 1:59:29.420
 I think the probability is fairly high

1:59:29.420 --> 1:59:32.900
 and frankly, we are seeing a wave of variants

1:59:32.900 --> 1:59:37.140
 that we will have to do a careful analysis

1:59:37.140 --> 1:59:39.060
 to figure out what exactly that has to do

1:59:39.060 --> 1:59:40.740
 with campaigns of vaccination,

1:59:40.740 --> 1:59:42.340
 where they have been, where they haven't been,

1:59:42.340 --> 1:59:43.940
 where the variants emerged from.

1:59:43.940 --> 1:59:47.100
 But I believe that what we are seeing is a disturbing pattern

1:59:47.100 --> 1:59:50.860
 that reflects that those who were advising caution

1:59:50.860 --> 1:59:51.860
 may well have been right.

1:59:51.860 --> 1:59:55.260
 The data here, by the way, and the small tangent is terrible.

1:59:55.260 --> 1:59:56.500
 Terrible, right.

1:59:56.500 --> 1:59:59.700
 And why is it terrible is another question, right?

1:59:59.700 --> 2:00:01.280
 This is where I started getting angry.

2:00:01.280 --> 2:00:02.120
 Yes.

2:00:02.120 --> 2:00:04.160
 It's like, there's an obvious opportunity

2:00:04.160 --> 2:00:07.660
 for exceptionally good data, for exceptionally rigorous,

2:00:07.660 --> 2:00:10.580
 like even the self, like the website for self reporting,

2:00:10.580 --> 2:00:12.580
 side effects for, not side effects,

2:00:12.580 --> 2:00:14.180
 but negative effects, right?

2:00:14.180 --> 2:00:15.020
 Adverse events.

2:00:15.020 --> 2:00:17.120
 Adverse events, sorry, for the vaccine.

2:00:18.540 --> 2:00:20.560
 Like, there's many things I could say

2:00:20.560 --> 2:00:22.240
 from both the study perspective,

2:00:22.240 --> 2:00:27.240
 but mostly, let me just put on my hat of like HTML

2:00:27.460 --> 2:00:29.840
 and like web design.

2:00:29.840 --> 2:00:32.700
 Like, it's like the worst website.

2:00:32.700 --> 2:00:34.800
 It makes it so unpleasant to report.

2:00:34.800 --> 2:00:37.100
 It makes it so unclear what you're reporting.

2:00:37.100 --> 2:00:38.860
 If somebody actually has serious effect,

2:00:38.860 --> 2:00:40.640
 like if you have very mild effects,

2:00:40.640 --> 2:00:43.280
 what are the incentives for you to even use

2:00:43.280 --> 2:00:46.420
 that crappy website with many pages and forms

2:00:46.420 --> 2:00:47.660
 that don't make any sense?

2:00:47.660 --> 2:00:49.200
 If you have adverse effects,

2:00:49.200 --> 2:00:53.180
 what are the incentives for you to use that website?

2:00:53.180 --> 2:00:55.100
 What is the trust that you have

2:00:55.100 --> 2:00:56.980
 that this information will be used well?

2:00:56.980 --> 2:00:58.220
 All those kinds of things.

2:00:58.220 --> 2:01:01.140
 And the data about who's getting vaccinated,

2:01:01.140 --> 2:01:04.180
 anonymized data about who's getting vaccinated,

2:01:04.180 --> 2:01:06.940
 where, when, with what vaccine,

2:01:06.940 --> 2:01:09.040
 coupled with the adverse effects,

2:01:09.040 --> 2:01:10.940
 all of that we should be collecting.

2:01:10.940 --> 2:01:13.340
 Instead, we're completely not.

2:01:13.340 --> 2:01:14.980
 We're doing it in a crappy way

2:01:14.980 --> 2:01:18.040
 and using that crappy data to make conclusions

2:01:18.040 --> 2:01:19.620
 that you then twist.

2:01:19.620 --> 2:01:21.160
 You're basically collecting in a way

2:01:21.160 --> 2:01:25.700
 that can arrive at whatever conclusions you want.

2:01:25.700 --> 2:01:29.500
 And the data is being collected by the institutions,

2:01:29.500 --> 2:01:31.460
 by governments, and so therefore,

2:01:31.460 --> 2:01:33.020
 it's obviously they're going to try

2:01:33.020 --> 2:01:35.540
 to construct any kind of narratives they want

2:01:35.540 --> 2:01:36.660
 based on this crappy data.

2:01:36.660 --> 2:01:39.740
 Reminds me of much of psychology, the field that I love,

2:01:39.740 --> 2:01:42.620
 but is flawed in many fundamental ways.

2:01:42.620 --> 2:01:46.780
 So rant over, but coupled with the dangers

2:01:46.780 --> 2:01:47.620
 that you're speaking to,

2:01:47.620 --> 2:01:52.160
 we don't have even the data to understand the dangers.

2:01:52.160 --> 2:01:55.660
 Yeah, I'm gonna pick up on your rant and say,

2:01:55.660 --> 2:02:00.660
 we, estimates of the degree of underreporting in VAERS

2:02:00.660 --> 2:02:05.660
 are that it is 10% of the real to 100%.

2:02:05.660 --> 2:02:08.020
 And that's the system for reporting.

2:02:08.020 --> 2:02:10.020
 Yeah, the VAERS system is the system

2:02:10.020 --> 2:02:11.140
 for reporting adverse events.

2:02:11.140 --> 2:02:16.140
 So in the US, we have above 5,000 unexpected deaths

2:02:18.180 --> 2:02:22.000
 that seem in time to be associated with vaccination.

2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:24.460
 That is an undercount, almost certainly,

2:02:24.460 --> 2:02:27.940
 and by a large factor.

2:02:27.940 --> 2:02:29.020
 We don't know how large.

2:02:29.020 --> 2:02:34.020
 I've seen estimates, 25,000 dead in the US alone.

2:02:34.020 --> 2:02:37.880
 Now, you can make the argument that, okay,

2:02:37.880 --> 2:02:39.280
 that's a large number,

2:02:39.280 --> 2:02:42.860
 but the necessity of immunizing the population

2:02:42.860 --> 2:02:45.420
 to drive SARS CoV2 to extinction

2:02:45.420 --> 2:02:47.960
 is such that it's an acceptable number.

2:02:47.960 --> 2:02:48.860
 But I would point out

2:02:48.860 --> 2:02:51.000
 that that actually does not make any sense.

2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:52.680
 And the reason it doesn't make any sense

2:02:52.680 --> 2:02:54.280
 is actually there are several reasons.

2:02:54.280 --> 2:02:57.180
 One, if that was really your point,

2:02:57.180 --> 2:02:59.940
 that yes, many, many people are gonna die,

2:02:59.940 --> 2:03:02.080
 but many more will die if we don't do this.

2:03:02.080 --> 2:03:05.140
 Were that your approach,

2:03:05.140 --> 2:03:08.660
 you would not be inoculating people who had had COVID 19,

2:03:08.660 --> 2:03:10.620
 which is a large population.

2:03:10.620 --> 2:03:13.260
 There's no reason to expose those people to danger.

2:03:13.260 --> 2:03:14.860
 Their risk of adverse events

2:03:14.860 --> 2:03:18.280
 in the case that they have them is greater.

2:03:18.280 --> 2:03:20.580
 So there's no reason that we would be allowing

2:03:20.580 --> 2:03:22.300
 those people to face a risk of death

2:03:22.300 --> 2:03:25.620
 if this was really about an acceptable number of deaths

2:03:25.620 --> 2:03:29.180
 arising out of this set of vaccines.

2:03:29.180 --> 2:03:30.500
 I would also point out

2:03:30.500 --> 2:03:32.800
 there's something incredibly bizarre.

2:03:32.800 --> 2:03:37.800
 And I struggle to find language that is strong enough

2:03:37.940 --> 2:03:42.940
 for the horror of vaccinating children in this case

2:03:43.260 --> 2:03:48.180
 because children suffer a greater risk of longterm effects

2:03:48.180 --> 2:03:49.820
 because they are going to live longer.

2:03:49.820 --> 2:03:51.900
 And because this is earlier in their development,

2:03:51.900 --> 2:03:55.640
 therefore it impacts systems that are still forming.

2:03:55.640 --> 2:03:57.860
 They tolerate COVID well.

2:03:57.860 --> 2:04:01.420
 And so the benefit to them is very small.

2:04:01.420 --> 2:04:04.060
 And so the only argument for doing this

2:04:04.060 --> 2:04:06.420
 is that they may cryptically be carrying more COVID

2:04:06.420 --> 2:04:09.600
 than we think, and therefore they may be integral

2:04:09.600 --> 2:04:11.900
 to the way the virus spreads to the population.

2:04:11.900 --> 2:04:14.260
 But if that's the reason that we are inoculating children,

2:04:14.260 --> 2:04:16.460
 and there has been some revision in the last day or two

2:04:16.460 --> 2:04:17.860
 about the recommendation on this

2:04:17.860 --> 2:04:19.780
 because of the adverse events

2:04:19.780 --> 2:04:20.980
 that have shown up in children,

2:04:20.980 --> 2:04:24.160
 but to the extent that we were vaccinating children,

2:04:24.160 --> 2:04:28.240
 we were doing it to protect old, infirm people

2:04:28.240 --> 2:04:32.700
 who are the most likely to succumb to COVID 19.

2:04:32.700 --> 2:04:37.100
 What society puts children in danger,

2:04:37.100 --> 2:04:40.860
 robs children of life to save old, infirm people?

2:04:40.860 --> 2:04:42.160
 That's upside down.

2:04:43.120 --> 2:04:46.820
 So there's something about the way we are going about

2:04:46.820 --> 2:04:48.700
 vaccinating, who we are vaccinating,

2:04:48.700 --> 2:04:52.300
 what dangers we are pretending don't exist

2:04:52.300 --> 2:04:55.700
 that suggests that to some set of people,

2:04:55.700 --> 2:04:58.660
 vaccinating people is a good in and of itself,

2:04:58.660 --> 2:05:00.460
 that that is the objective of the exercise,

2:05:00.460 --> 2:05:01.540
 not herd immunity.

2:05:01.540 --> 2:05:03.060
 And the last thing, and I'm sorry,

2:05:03.060 --> 2:05:05.540
 I don't wanna prevent you from jumping in here,

2:05:05.540 --> 2:05:07.500
 but the second reason, in addition to the fact

2:05:07.500 --> 2:05:09.180
 that we're exposing people to danger

2:05:09.180 --> 2:05:11.820
 that we should not be exposing them to.

2:05:11.820 --> 2:05:13.700
 By the way, as a tiny tangent,

2:05:13.700 --> 2:05:16.220
 another huge part of this soup

2:05:16.220 --> 2:05:17.540
 that should have been part of it

2:05:17.540 --> 2:05:20.860
 that's an incredible solution is large scale testing.

2:05:20.860 --> 2:05:22.020
 Mm hmm.

2:05:22.020 --> 2:05:26.440
 But that might be another couple hour conversation,

2:05:26.440 --> 2:05:28.660
 but there's these solutions that are obvious

2:05:28.660 --> 2:05:30.580
 that were available from the very beginning.

2:05:30.580 --> 2:05:34.720
 So you could argue that iveractin is not that obvious,

2:05:34.720 --> 2:05:38.780
 but maybe the whole point is you have aggressive,

2:05:38.780 --> 2:05:43.120
 very fast research that leads to a meta analysis

2:05:43.120 --> 2:05:46.140
 and then large scale production and deployment.

2:05:46.140 --> 2:05:49.020
 Okay, at least that possibility

2:05:49.020 --> 2:05:51.220
 should be seriously considered,

2:05:51.220 --> 2:05:53.620
 coupled with a serious consideration

2:05:53.620 --> 2:05:55.700
 of large scale deployment of testing,

2:05:55.700 --> 2:06:00.100
 at home testing that could have accelerated

2:06:00.100 --> 2:06:05.100
 the speed at which we reached that herd immunity.

2:06:07.060 --> 2:06:08.660
 But I don't even wanna.

2:06:08.660 --> 2:06:11.720
 Well, let me just say, I am also completely shocked

2:06:11.720 --> 2:06:15.040
 that we did not get on high quality testing early

2:06:15.040 --> 2:06:19.060
 and that we are still suffering from this even now,

2:06:19.060 --> 2:06:21.580
 because just the simple ability to track

2:06:21.580 --> 2:06:23.740
 where the virus moves between people

2:06:23.740 --> 2:06:26.120
 would tell us a lot about its mode of transmission,

2:06:26.120 --> 2:06:28.860
 which would allow us to protect ourselves better.

2:06:28.860 --> 2:06:32.340
 Instead, that information was hard won

2:06:32.340 --> 2:06:33.260
 and for no good reason.

2:06:33.260 --> 2:06:35.900
 So I also find this mysterious.

2:06:35.900 --> 2:06:39.940
 You've spoken with Eric Weinstein, your brother,

2:06:39.940 --> 2:06:41.460
 on his podcast, The Portal,

2:06:41.460 --> 2:06:45.180
 about the ideas that eventually led to the paper

2:06:45.180 --> 2:06:48.660
 you published titled, The Reserved Capacity Hypothesis.

2:06:50.500 --> 2:06:55.500
 I think first, can you explain this paper

2:06:56.540 --> 2:06:59.900
 and the ideas that led up to it?

2:06:59.900 --> 2:07:04.000
 Sure, easier to explain the conclusion of the paper.

2:07:05.560 --> 2:07:08.340
 There's a question about why a creature

2:07:08.340 --> 2:07:11.980
 that can replace its cells with new cells

2:07:11.980 --> 2:07:14.940
 grows feeble and inefficient with age.

2:07:14.940 --> 2:07:18.540
 We call that process, which is otherwise called aging,

2:07:18.540 --> 2:07:19.860
 we call it senescence.

2:07:20.940 --> 2:07:25.940
 And senescence, in this paper, it is hypothesized,

2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:31.000
 is the unavoidable downside of a cancer prevention

2:07:32.860 --> 2:07:36.300
 feature of our bodies.

2:07:36.300 --> 2:07:39.820
 That each cell has a limit on the number of times

2:07:39.820 --> 2:07:40.740
 it can divide.

2:07:40.740 --> 2:07:42.980
 There are a few cells in the body that are exceptional,

2:07:42.980 --> 2:07:45.000
 but most of our cells can only divide

2:07:45.000 --> 2:07:46.060
 a limited number of times.

2:07:46.060 --> 2:07:47.860
 That's called the Hayflick limit.

2:07:47.860 --> 2:07:52.460
 And the Hayflick limit reduces the ability

2:07:52.460 --> 2:07:55.740
 of the organism to replace tissues.

2:07:55.740 --> 2:07:58.780
 It therefore results in a failure over time

2:07:58.780 --> 2:08:01.340
 of maintenance and repair.

2:08:01.340 --> 2:08:06.180
 And that explains why we become decrepit as we grow old.

2:08:06.180 --> 2:08:09.460
 The question was why would that be,

2:08:09.460 --> 2:08:12.900
 especially in light of the fact that the mechanism

2:08:12.900 --> 2:08:16.580
 that seems to limit the ability of cells to reproduce

2:08:16.580 --> 2:08:18.820
 is something called a telomere.

2:08:18.820 --> 2:08:22.940
 Telomere is a, it's not a gene, but it's a DNA sequence

2:08:22.940 --> 2:08:24.880
 at the ends of our chromosomes

2:08:24.880 --> 2:08:26.340
 that is just simply repetitive.

2:08:26.340 --> 2:08:30.240
 And the number of repeats functions like a counter.

2:08:30.240 --> 2:08:33.000
 So there's a number of repeats that you have

2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:34.420
 after development is finished.

2:08:34.420 --> 2:08:36.260
 And then each time the cell divides a little bit

2:08:36.260 --> 2:08:37.620
 of telomere is lost.

2:08:37.620 --> 2:08:40.260
 And at the point that the telomere becomes critically short,

2:08:40.260 --> 2:08:42.820
 the cell stops dividing even though it still has

2:08:42.820 --> 2:08:44.660
 the capacity to do so.

2:08:44.660 --> 2:08:47.420
 Stops dividing and it starts transcribing different genes

2:08:47.420 --> 2:08:50.300
 than it did when it had more telomere.

2:08:50.300 --> 2:08:53.900
 So what my work did was it looked at the fact

2:08:53.900 --> 2:08:56.700
 that the telomeric shortening was being studied

2:08:56.700 --> 2:08:57.900
 by two different groups.

2:08:57.900 --> 2:09:00.820
 It was being studied by people who were interested

2:09:00.820 --> 2:09:03.460
 in counteracting the aging process.

2:09:03.460 --> 2:09:06.540
 And it was being studied in exactly the opposite fashion

2:09:06.540 --> 2:09:10.500
 by people who were interested in tumorigenesis and cancer.

2:09:10.500 --> 2:09:13.300
 The thought being because it was true that when one looked

2:09:13.300 --> 2:09:16.700
 into tumors, they always had telomerase active.

2:09:16.700 --> 2:09:19.040
 That's the enzyme that lengthens our telomeres.

2:09:19.040 --> 2:09:24.040
 So those folks were interested in bringing about a halt

2:09:24.520 --> 2:09:25.700
 to the lengthening of telomeres

2:09:25.700 --> 2:09:27.540
 in order to counteract cancer.

2:09:27.540 --> 2:09:30.640
 And the folks who were studying the senescence process

2:09:30.640 --> 2:09:32.280
 were interested in lengthening telomeres

2:09:32.280 --> 2:09:35.780
 in order to generate greater repair capacity.

2:09:35.780 --> 2:09:38.660
 And my point was evolutionarily speaking,

2:09:38.660 --> 2:09:42.900
 this looks like a pleiotropic effect

2:09:42.900 --> 2:09:47.900
 that the genes which create the tendency of the cells

2:09:49.980 --> 2:09:53.340
 to be limited in their capacity to replace themselves

2:09:53.340 --> 2:09:55.580
 are providing a benefit in youth,

2:09:55.580 --> 2:09:59.320
 which is that we are largely free of tumors and cancer

2:09:59.320 --> 2:10:02.300
 at the inevitable late life cost that we grow feeble

2:10:02.300 --> 2:10:04.840
 and inefficient and eventually die.

2:10:04.840 --> 2:10:09.840
 And that matches a very old hypothesis in evolutionary theory

2:10:10.260 --> 2:10:13.540
 by somebody I was fortunate enough to know, George Williams,

2:10:13.540 --> 2:10:16.620
 one of the great 20th century evolutionists

2:10:16.620 --> 2:10:19.760
 who argued that senescence would have to be caused

2:10:19.760 --> 2:10:23.780
 by pleiotropic genes that cause early life benefits

2:10:23.780 --> 2:10:26.160
 at unavoidable late life costs.

2:10:26.160 --> 2:10:29.220
 And although this isn't the exact nature of the system,

2:10:29.220 --> 2:10:32.740
 he predicted it matches what he was expecting

2:10:32.740 --> 2:10:35.880
 in many regards to a shocking degree.

2:10:35.880 --> 2:10:40.880
 That said, the focus of the paper is about the,

2:10:41.480 --> 2:10:43.880
 well, let me just read the abstract.

2:10:43.880 --> 2:10:47.460
 We observed that captive rodent breeding protocols designed,

2:10:47.460 --> 2:10:49.060
 this is the end of the abstract.

2:10:49.060 --> 2:10:51.500
 We observed that captive rodent breeding protocols

2:10:51.500 --> 2:10:53.660
 designed to increase reproductive output,

2:10:53.660 --> 2:10:55.780
 simultaneously exert strong selection

2:10:55.780 --> 2:10:58.040
 against reproductive senescence

2:10:58.040 --> 2:11:00.140
 and virtually eliminate selection

2:11:00.140 --> 2:11:03.260
 that would otherwise favor tumor suppression.

2:11:03.260 --> 2:11:05.740
 This appears to have greatly elongated

2:11:05.740 --> 2:11:07.940
 the telomeres of laboratory mice.

2:11:07.940 --> 2:11:10.780
 With their telomeric failsafe effectively disabled,

2:11:10.780 --> 2:11:12.620
 these animals are unreliable models

2:11:12.620 --> 2:11:15.300
 of normal senescence and tumor formation.

2:11:15.300 --> 2:11:19.660
 So basically using these mice is not going to lead

2:11:19.660 --> 2:11:21.500
 to the right kinds of conclusions.

2:11:21.500 --> 2:11:24.180
 Safety tests employing these animals

2:11:24.180 --> 2:11:26.700
 likely overestimate cancer risks

2:11:26.700 --> 2:11:29.020
 and underestimate tissue damage

2:11:29.020 --> 2:11:31.700
 and consequent accelerated senescence.

2:11:32.780 --> 2:11:37.280
 So I think, especially with your discussion with Eric,

2:11:38.180 --> 2:11:43.180
 the conclusion of this paper has to do with the fact that,

2:11:43.500 --> 2:11:48.500
 like we shouldn't be using these mice to test the safety

2:11:48.500 --> 2:11:53.300
 or to make conclusions about cancer or senescence.

2:11:53.300 --> 2:11:55.060
 Is that the basic takeaway?

2:11:55.060 --> 2:11:57.820
 Like basically saying that the length of these telomeres

2:11:57.820 --> 2:12:00.100
 is an important variable to consider.

2:12:00.100 --> 2:12:01.980
 Well, let's put it this way.

2:12:01.980 --> 2:12:05.780
 I think there was a reason that the world of scientists

2:12:05.780 --> 2:12:07.540
 who was working on telomeres

2:12:07.540 --> 2:12:10.920
 did not spot the pleiotropic relationship

2:12:10.920 --> 2:12:15.360
 that was the key argument in my paper.

2:12:16.300 --> 2:12:19.580
 The reason they didn't spot it was that there was a result

2:12:19.580 --> 2:12:22.060
 that everybody knew, which seemed inconsistent.

2:12:22.060 --> 2:12:26.980
 The result was that mice have very long telomeres,

2:12:26.980 --> 2:12:30.260
 but they do not have very long lives.

2:12:30.260 --> 2:12:32.480
 Now, we can talk about what the actual meaning

2:12:32.480 --> 2:12:34.560
 of don't have very long lives is,

2:12:34.560 --> 2:12:39.220
 but in the end, I was confronted with a hypothesis

2:12:39.220 --> 2:12:41.580
 that would explain a great many features

2:12:41.580 --> 2:12:44.780
 of the way mammals and indeed vertebrates age,

2:12:44.780 --> 2:12:46.660
 but it was inconsistent with one result.

2:12:46.660 --> 2:12:48.340
 And at first I thought,

2:12:48.340 --> 2:12:50.020
 maybe there's something wrong with the result.

2:12:50.020 --> 2:12:51.340
 Maybe this is one of these cases

2:12:51.340 --> 2:12:54.380
 where the result was achieved once

2:12:54.380 --> 2:12:56.460
 through some bad protocol and everybody else

2:12:56.460 --> 2:12:58.760
 was repeating it, didn't turn out to be the case.

2:12:58.760 --> 2:13:00.440
 Many laboratories had established

2:13:00.440 --> 2:13:02.860
 that mice had ultra long telomeres.

2:13:02.860 --> 2:13:05.320
 And so I began to wonder whether or not

2:13:05.320 --> 2:13:09.580
 there was something about the breeding protocols

2:13:09.580 --> 2:13:11.220
 that generated these mice.

2:13:11.220 --> 2:13:13.860
 And what that would predict is that the mice

2:13:13.860 --> 2:13:16.940
 that have long telomeres would be laboratory mice

2:13:16.940 --> 2:13:18.700
 and that wild mice would not.

2:13:18.700 --> 2:13:23.180
 And Carol Greider, who agreed to collaborate with me,

2:13:23.180 --> 2:13:27.620
 tested that hypothesis and showed that it was indeed true,

2:13:27.620 --> 2:13:29.900
 that wild derived mice, or at least mice

2:13:29.900 --> 2:13:32.700
 that had been in captivity for a much shorter period of time

2:13:32.700 --> 2:13:35.180
 did not have ultra long telomeres.

2:13:35.180 --> 2:13:38.660
 Now, what this implied though, as you read,

2:13:38.660 --> 2:13:41.100
 is that our breeding protocols

2:13:41.100 --> 2:13:43.080
 generate lengthening of telomeres.

2:13:43.080 --> 2:13:45.700
 And the implication of that is that the animals

2:13:45.700 --> 2:13:47.400
 that have these very long telomeres

2:13:47.400 --> 2:13:50.500
 will be hyper prone to create tumors.

2:13:50.500 --> 2:13:54.420
 They will be extremely resistant to toxins

2:13:54.420 --> 2:13:56.900
 because they have effectively an infinite capacity

2:13:56.900 --> 2:13:58.940
 to replace any damaged tissue.

2:13:58.940 --> 2:14:02.660
 And so ironically, if you give one of these

2:14:02.660 --> 2:14:06.460
 ultra long telomere lab mice a toxin,

2:14:06.460 --> 2:14:08.320
 if the toxin doesn't outright kill it,

2:14:08.320 --> 2:14:10.840
 it may actually increase its lifespan

2:14:10.840 --> 2:14:14.300
 because it functions as a kind of chemotherapy.

2:14:14.300 --> 2:14:16.940
 So the reason that chemotherapy works

2:14:16.940 --> 2:14:19.180
 is that dividing cells are more vulnerable

2:14:19.180 --> 2:14:21.100
 than cells that are not dividing.

2:14:21.100 --> 2:14:23.540
 And so if this mouse has effectively

2:14:23.540 --> 2:14:26.280
 had its cancer protection turned off,

2:14:26.280 --> 2:14:28.500
 and it has cells dividing too rapidly,

2:14:28.500 --> 2:14:31.420
 and you give it a toxin, you will slow down its tumors

2:14:31.420 --> 2:14:33.980
 faster than you harm its other tissues.

2:14:33.980 --> 2:14:35.700
 And so you'll get a paradoxical result

2:14:35.700 --> 2:14:38.300
 that actually some drug that's toxic

2:14:38.300 --> 2:14:40.460
 seems to benefit the mouse.

2:14:40.460 --> 2:14:43.140
 Now, I don't think that that was understood

2:14:43.140 --> 2:14:44.720
 before I published my paper.

2:14:44.720 --> 2:14:46.820
 Now I'm pretty sure it has to be.

2:14:46.820 --> 2:14:50.700
 And the problem is that this actually is a system

2:14:50.700 --> 2:14:53.180
 that serves pharmaceutical companies

2:14:53.180 --> 2:14:57.180
 that have the difficult job of bringing compounds to market,

2:14:57.180 --> 2:14:59.420
 many of which will be toxic.

2:14:59.420 --> 2:15:01.780
 Maybe all of them will be toxic.

2:15:01.780 --> 2:15:04.780
 And these mice predispose our system

2:15:04.780 --> 2:15:07.580
 to declare these toxic compounds safe.

2:15:07.580 --> 2:15:10.460
 And in fact, I believe we've seen the errors

2:15:10.460 --> 2:15:12.940
 that result from using these mice a number of times,

2:15:12.940 --> 2:15:15.540
 most famously with Vioxx, which turned out

2:15:15.540 --> 2:15:18.180
 to do conspicuous heart damage.

2:15:18.180 --> 2:15:20.700
 Why do you think this paper and this idea

2:15:20.700 --> 2:15:23.700
 has not gotten significant traction?

2:15:23.700 --> 2:15:27.580
 Well, my collaborator, Carol Greider,

2:15:27.580 --> 2:15:32.180
 said something to me that rings in my ears to this day.

2:15:32.180 --> 2:15:35.780
 She initially, after she showed that laboratory mice

2:15:35.780 --> 2:15:37.380
 have anomalously long telomeres

2:15:37.380 --> 2:15:39.980
 and that wild mice don't have long telomeres,

2:15:39.980 --> 2:15:42.300
 I asked her where she was going to publish that result

2:15:42.300 --> 2:15:44.500
 so that I could cite it in my paper.

2:15:44.500 --> 2:15:47.460
 And she said that she was going to keep the result in house

2:15:47.460 --> 2:15:49.780
 rather than publish it.

2:15:49.780 --> 2:15:54.020
 And at the time, I was a young graduate student.

2:15:54.020 --> 2:15:56.780
 I didn't really understand what she was saying.

2:15:56.780 --> 2:16:01.420
 But in some sense, the knowledge that a model organism

2:16:01.420 --> 2:16:04.780
 is broken in a way that creates the likelihood

2:16:04.780 --> 2:16:08.260
 that certain results will be reliably generateable,

2:16:08.260 --> 2:16:10.700
 you can publish a paper and make a big splash

2:16:10.700 --> 2:16:13.300
 with such a thing, or you can exploit the fact

2:16:13.300 --> 2:16:16.100
 that you know how those models will misbehave

2:16:16.100 --> 2:16:17.660
 and other people don't.

2:16:17.660 --> 2:16:22.300
 So there's a question, if somebody is motivated cynically

2:16:22.300 --> 2:16:25.540
 and what they want to do is appear to have deeper insight

2:16:25.540 --> 2:16:27.580
 into biology because they predict things

2:16:27.580 --> 2:16:31.100
 better than others do, knowing where the flaw is

2:16:31.100 --> 2:16:34.940
 so that your predictions come out true is advantageous.

2:16:34.940 --> 2:16:38.900
 At the same time, I can't help but imagine

2:16:38.900 --> 2:16:40.100
 that the pharmaceutical industry,

2:16:40.100 --> 2:16:42.660
 when it figured out that the mice were predisposed

2:16:42.660 --> 2:16:45.700
 to suggest that drugs were safe,

2:16:45.700 --> 2:16:49.040
 didn't leap to fix the problem because in some sense,

2:16:49.040 --> 2:16:51.740
 it was the perfect cover for the difficult job

2:16:51.740 --> 2:16:55.460
 of bringing drugs to market and then discovering

2:16:55.460 --> 2:16:57.820
 their actual toxicity profile, right?

2:16:57.820 --> 2:16:59.500
 This made things look safer than they were

2:16:59.500 --> 2:17:01.220
 and I believe a lot of profits

2:17:01.220 --> 2:17:03.180
 have likely been generated downstream.

2:17:04.020 --> 2:17:06.700
 So to kind of play devil's advocate,

2:17:06.700 --> 2:17:10.380
 it's also possible that this particular,

2:17:10.380 --> 2:17:12.500
 the length of the telomeres is not a strong variable

2:17:12.500 --> 2:17:16.180
 for the drug development and for the conclusions

2:17:16.180 --> 2:17:18.500
 that Carol and others have been studying.

2:17:18.500 --> 2:17:21.100
 Is it possible for that to be the case?

2:17:22.820 --> 2:17:27.100
 So one reason she and others could be ignoring this

2:17:27.100 --> 2:17:29.500
 is because it's not a strong variable.

2:17:29.500 --> 2:17:31.060
 Well, I don't believe so and in fact,

2:17:31.060 --> 2:17:34.160
 at the point that I went to publish my paper,

2:17:34.160 --> 2:17:36.680
 Carol published her result.

2:17:36.680 --> 2:17:39.580
 She did so in a way that did not make a huge splash.

2:17:39.580 --> 2:17:43.100
 Did she, I apologize if I don't know how,

2:17:44.140 --> 2:17:49.140
 what was the emphasis of her publication of that paper?

2:17:49.860 --> 2:17:52.220
 Was it purely just kind of showing data

2:17:52.220 --> 2:17:54.140
 or is there more, because in your paper,

2:17:54.140 --> 2:17:57.580
 there's a kind of more of a philosophical statement as well.

2:17:57.580 --> 2:18:00.920
 Well, my paper was motivated by interest

2:18:00.920 --> 2:18:03.540
 in the evolutionary dynamics around senescence.

2:18:03.540 --> 2:18:07.660
 I wasn't pursuing grants or anything like that.

2:18:07.660 --> 2:18:10.860
 I was just working on a puzzle I thought was interesting.

2:18:10.860 --> 2:18:14.320
 Carol has, of course, gone on to win a Nobel Prize

2:18:14.320 --> 2:18:17.460
 for her co discovery with Elizabeth Greider

2:18:17.460 --> 2:18:20.400
 of telomerase, the enzyme that lengthens telomeres.

2:18:21.760 --> 2:18:25.720
 But anyway, she's a heavy hitter in the academic world.

2:18:25.720 --> 2:18:27.800
 I don't know exactly what her purpose was.

2:18:27.800 --> 2:18:30.220
 I do know that she told me she wasn't planning to publish

2:18:30.220 --> 2:18:32.220
 and I do know that I discovered that she was

2:18:32.220 --> 2:18:34.380
 in the process of publishing very late

2:18:34.380 --> 2:18:36.860
 and when I asked her to send me the paper

2:18:36.860 --> 2:18:40.960
 to see whether or not she had put evidence in it

2:18:40.960 --> 2:18:43.540
 that the hypothesis had come from me,

2:18:43.540 --> 2:18:45.140
 she grudgingly sent it to me

2:18:45.140 --> 2:18:46.700
 and my name was nowhere mentioned

2:18:46.700 --> 2:18:49.580
 and she broke contact at that point.

2:18:50.960 --> 2:18:53.380
 What it is that motivated her, I don't know,

2:18:53.380 --> 2:18:55.020
 but I don't think it can possibly be

2:18:55.020 --> 2:18:57.300
 that this result is unimportant.

2:18:57.300 --> 2:19:00.580
 The fact is, the reason I called her in the first place,

2:19:00.580 --> 2:19:04.820
 an established contact that generated our collaboration,

2:19:04.820 --> 2:19:07.040
 was that she was a leading light in the field

2:19:07.040 --> 2:19:11.020
 of telomeric studies and because of that,

2:19:11.020 --> 2:19:14.060
 this question about whether the model organisms

2:19:14.060 --> 2:19:18.100
 are distorting the understanding

2:19:18.100 --> 2:19:20.980
 of the functioning of telomeres, it's central.

2:19:20.980 --> 2:19:23.580
 Do you feel like you've been,

2:19:23.580 --> 2:19:27.140
 as a young graduate student, do you think Carol

2:19:27.140 --> 2:19:28.660
 or do you think the scientific community

2:19:28.660 --> 2:19:31.540
 broadly screwed you over in some way?

2:19:31.540 --> 2:19:33.260
 I don't think of it in those terms.

2:19:33.260 --> 2:19:37.500
 Probably partly because it's not productive

2:19:37.500 --> 2:19:42.360
 but I have a complex relationship with this story.

2:19:42.360 --> 2:19:44.940
 On the one hand, I'm livid with Carol Greider

2:19:44.940 --> 2:19:46.400
 for what she did.

2:19:46.400 --> 2:19:50.060
 She absolutely pretended that I didn't exist in this story

2:19:50.060 --> 2:19:51.900
 and I don't think I was a threat to her.

2:19:51.900 --> 2:19:54.700
 My interest was as an evolutionary biologist,

2:19:54.700 --> 2:19:57.460
 I had made an evolutionary contribution,

2:19:57.460 --> 2:19:59.540
 she had tested a hypothesis and frankly,

2:19:59.540 --> 2:20:01.540
 I think it would have been better for her

2:20:01.540 --> 2:20:03.780
 if she had acknowledged what I had done.

2:20:03.780 --> 2:20:05.900
 I think it would have enhanced her work

2:20:07.020 --> 2:20:10.460
 and I was, let's put it this way,

2:20:10.460 --> 2:20:12.420
 when I watched her Nobel lecture,

2:20:12.420 --> 2:20:13.980
 and I should say there's been a lot of confusion

2:20:13.980 --> 2:20:15.020
 about this Nobel stuff.

2:20:15.020 --> 2:20:17.840
 I've never said that I should have gotten a Nobel prize.

2:20:17.840 --> 2:20:20.320
 People have misportrayed that.

2:20:23.180 --> 2:20:24.980
 In listening to her lecture,

2:20:25.840 --> 2:20:29.100
 I had one of the most bizarre emotional experiences

2:20:29.100 --> 2:20:33.140
 of my life because she presented the work

2:20:33.140 --> 2:20:35.940
 that resulted from my hypothesis.

2:20:35.940 --> 2:20:38.860
 She presented it as she had in her paper

2:20:38.860 --> 2:20:42.300
 with no acknowledgement of where it had come from

2:20:42.300 --> 2:20:47.220
 and she had in fact portrayed the distortion

2:20:47.220 --> 2:20:50.620
 of the telomeres as if it were a lucky fact

2:20:50.620 --> 2:20:53.180
 because it allowed testing hypotheses

2:20:53.180 --> 2:20:55.600
 that would otherwise not be testable.

2:20:55.600 --> 2:21:00.600
 You have to understand as a young scientist

2:21:00.680 --> 2:21:04.480
 to watch work that you have done presented

2:21:04.480 --> 2:21:07.680
 in what's surely the most important lecture

2:21:07.680 --> 2:21:11.440
 of her career, it's thrilling.

2:21:11.440 --> 2:21:16.440
 It was thrilling to see her figures

2:21:16.720 --> 2:21:18.640
 projected on the screen there.

2:21:18.640 --> 2:21:21.140
 To have been part of work that was important enough

2:21:21.140 --> 2:21:23.160
 for that felt great and of course,

2:21:23.160 --> 2:21:26.280
 to be erased from the story felt absolutely terrible.

2:21:27.720 --> 2:21:30.080
 So anyway, that's sort of where I am with it.

2:21:30.080 --> 2:21:35.080
 My sense is what I'm really troubled by in this story

2:21:35.960 --> 2:21:40.960
 is the fact that as far as I know,

2:21:41.920 --> 2:21:44.780
 the flaw with the mice has not been addressed.

2:21:45.800 --> 2:21:48.020
 And actually, Eric did some looking into this.

2:21:48.020 --> 2:21:50.680
 He tried to establish by calling the Jack's lab

2:21:50.680 --> 2:21:54.360
 and trying to ascertain what had happened with the colonies,

2:21:54.360 --> 2:21:57.000
 whether any change in protocol had occurred

2:21:57.000 --> 2:21:58.720
 and he couldn't get anywhere.

2:21:58.720 --> 2:22:02.280
 There was seemingly no awareness that it was even an issue.

2:22:02.280 --> 2:22:06.080
 So I'm very troubled by the fact that as a father,

2:22:06.080 --> 2:22:10.480
 for example, I'm in no position to protect my family

2:22:10.480 --> 2:22:12.400
 from the hazard that I believe lurks

2:22:12.400 --> 2:22:15.020
 in our medicine cabinets, right?

2:22:15.020 --> 2:22:17.360
 Even though I'm aware of where the hazard comes from,

2:22:17.360 --> 2:22:18.920
 it doesn't tell me anything useful

2:22:18.920 --> 2:22:21.160
 about which of these drugs will turn out to do damage

2:22:21.160 --> 2:22:23.200
 if that is ultimately tested.

2:22:23.200 --> 2:22:26.500
 And that's a very frustrating position to be in.

2:22:26.500 --> 2:22:28.160
 On the other hand, there's a part of me

2:22:28.160 --> 2:22:31.640
 that's even still grateful to Carol for taking my call.

2:22:31.640 --> 2:22:33.000
 She didn't have to take my call

2:22:33.000 --> 2:22:34.640
 and talk to some young graduate student

2:22:34.640 --> 2:22:36.220
 who had some evolutionary idea

2:22:36.220 --> 2:22:41.220
 that wasn't in her wheelhouse specifically, and yet she did.

2:22:41.320 --> 2:22:44.640
 And for a while, she was a good collaborator, so.

2:22:44.640 --> 2:22:49.040
 Well, can I, I have to proceed carefully here because

2:22:49.040 --> 2:22:50.640
 it's a complicated topic.

2:22:52.360 --> 2:22:53.740
 So she took the call.

2:22:55.760 --> 2:23:00.040
 And you kind of, you're kind of saying that

2:23:01.480 --> 2:23:05.000
 she basically erased credit, you know,

2:23:05.000 --> 2:23:07.200
 pretending you didn't exist in some kind of,

2:23:07.200 --> 2:23:08.520
 in a certain sense.

2:23:11.040 --> 2:23:12.440
 Let me phrase it this way.

2:23:12.440 --> 2:23:17.440
 I've, as a research scientist at MIT,

2:23:17.920 --> 2:23:21.400
 I've had, and especially just part of

2:23:22.860 --> 2:23:25.360
 a large set of collaborations,

2:23:25.360 --> 2:23:27.360
 I've had a lot of students come to me

2:23:28.400 --> 2:23:31.260
 and talk to me about ideas,

2:23:31.260 --> 2:23:33.600
 perhaps less interesting than what we're discussing here

2:23:33.600 --> 2:23:38.360
 in the space of AI, that I've been thinking about anyway.

2:23:38.360 --> 2:23:42.760
 In general, with everything I'm doing with robotics, people

2:23:45.900 --> 2:23:47.660
 have told me a bunch of ideas

2:23:47.660 --> 2:23:49.400
 that I'm already thinking about.

2:23:49.400 --> 2:23:53.080
 The point is taking that idea, see, this is different

2:23:53.080 --> 2:23:55.240
 because the idea has more power in the space

2:23:55.240 --> 2:23:56.200
 that we're talking about here,

2:23:56.200 --> 2:23:58.520
 and robotics is like your idea means shit

2:23:58.520 --> 2:24:00.080
 until you build it.

2:24:00.080 --> 2:24:03.160
 Like, so the engineering world is a little different,

2:24:03.160 --> 2:24:07.980
 but there's a kind of sense that I probably forgot

2:24:07.980 --> 2:24:10.380
 a lot of brilliant ideas have been told to me.

2:24:11.520 --> 2:24:14.800
 Do you think she pretended you don't exist?

2:24:14.800 --> 2:24:19.740
 Do you think she was so busy that she kind of forgot,

2:24:19.740 --> 2:24:21.480
 you know, that she has like the stream

2:24:21.480 --> 2:24:23.160
 of brilliant people around her,

2:24:23.160 --> 2:24:26.240
 there's a bunch of ideas that are swimming in the air,

2:24:26.240 --> 2:24:28.280
 and you just kind of forget people

2:24:28.280 --> 2:24:30.280
 that are a little bit on the periphery

2:24:30.280 --> 2:24:33.580
 on the idea generation, like, or is it some mix of both?

2:24:34.720 --> 2:24:36.700
 It's not a mix of both.

2:24:36.700 --> 2:24:39.840
 I know that because we corresponded.

2:24:39.840 --> 2:24:41.840
 She put a graduate student on this work.

2:24:41.840 --> 2:24:46.720
 He emailed me excitedly when the results came in.

2:24:46.720 --> 2:24:50.160
 So there was no ambiguity about what had happened.

2:24:50.160 --> 2:24:52.920
 What's more, when I went to publish my work,

2:24:52.920 --> 2:24:56.680
 I actually sent it to Carol in order to get her feedback

2:24:56.680 --> 2:24:59.800
 because I wanted to be a good collaborator to her,

2:24:59.800 --> 2:25:02.760
 and she absolutely panned it,

2:25:02.760 --> 2:25:06.080
 made many critiques that were not valid,

2:25:06.080 --> 2:25:07.600
 but it was clear at that point

2:25:07.600 --> 2:25:10.160
 that she became an antagonist,

2:25:10.160 --> 2:25:12.480
 and none of this adds up.

2:25:12.480 --> 2:25:15.360
 She couldn't possibly have forgotten the conversation.

2:25:16.960 --> 2:25:21.560
 I believe I even sent her tissues at some point in part,

2:25:21.560 --> 2:25:23.840
 not related to this project, but as a favor.

2:25:23.840 --> 2:25:25.840
 She was doing another project that involved telomeres,

2:25:25.840 --> 2:25:28.040
 and she needed samples that I could get ahold of

2:25:28.040 --> 2:25:30.800
 because of the Museum of Zoology that I was in.

2:25:30.800 --> 2:25:34.200
 So this was not a one off conversation.

2:25:34.200 --> 2:25:36.160
 I certainly know that those sorts of things can happen,

2:25:36.160 --> 2:25:37.840
 but that's not what happened here.

2:25:37.840 --> 2:25:41.300
 This was a relationship that existed

2:25:41.300 --> 2:25:43.440
 and then was suddenly cut short

2:25:43.440 --> 2:25:46.360
 at the point that she published her paper by surprise

2:25:46.360 --> 2:25:48.980
 without saying where the hypothesis had come from

2:25:48.980 --> 2:25:53.980
 and began to be a opposing force to my work.

2:25:54.900 --> 2:25:57.000
 Is there, there's a bunch of trajectories

2:25:57.000 --> 2:25:58.700
 you could have taken through life.

2:25:58.700 --> 2:26:03.700
 Do you think about the trajectory of being a researcher,

2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:10.140
 of then going to war in the space of ideas,

2:26:10.140 --> 2:26:13.560
 of publishing further papers along this line?

2:26:13.560 --> 2:26:18.560
 I mean, that's often the dynamic of that fascinating space

2:26:18.880 --> 2:26:21.980
 is you have a junior researcher with brilliant ideas

2:26:21.980 --> 2:26:24.980
 and a senior researcher that starts out as a mentor

2:26:24.980 --> 2:26:26.000
 that becomes a competitor.

2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:27.800
 I mean, that happens.

2:26:27.800 --> 2:26:30.460
 But then the way to,

2:26:31.360 --> 2:26:33.560
 it's almost an opportunity to shine

2:26:33.560 --> 2:26:36.840
 is to publish a bunch more papers in this place

2:26:36.840 --> 2:26:39.280
 to tear it apart, to dig into,

2:26:39.280 --> 2:26:42.600
 like really make it a war of ideas.

2:26:42.600 --> 2:26:45.400
 Did you consider that possible trajectory?

2:26:45.400 --> 2:26:46.840
 I did.

2:26:46.840 --> 2:26:48.400
 A couple of things to say about it.

2:26:48.400 --> 2:26:51.800
 One, this work was not central for me.

2:26:51.800 --> 2:26:54.480
 I took a year on the T. Lemire project

2:26:54.480 --> 2:26:57.600
 because something fascinating occurred to me

2:26:57.600 --> 2:26:58.480
 and I pursued it.

2:26:58.480 --> 2:26:59.560
 And the more I pursued it,

2:26:59.560 --> 2:27:01.440
 the clearer it was there was something there.

2:27:01.440 --> 2:27:03.800
 But it wasn't the focus of my graduate work.

2:27:03.800 --> 2:27:08.680
 And I didn't want to become a T. Lemire researcher.

2:27:08.680 --> 2:27:12.260
 What I want to do is to be an evolutionary biologist

2:27:12.260 --> 2:27:15.900
 who upgrades the toolkit of evolutionary concepts

2:27:15.900 --> 2:27:17.800
 so that we can see more clearly

2:27:17.800 --> 2:27:20.180
 how organisms function and why.

2:27:20.180 --> 2:27:24.880
 And T. Lemire's was a proof of concept, right?

2:27:24.880 --> 2:27:26.360
 That paper was a proof of concept

2:27:26.360 --> 2:27:28.260
 that the toolkit in question works.

2:27:30.400 --> 2:27:35.400
 As for the need to pursue it further,

2:27:35.640 --> 2:27:37.080
 I think it's kind of absurd

2:27:37.080 --> 2:27:38.480
 and you're not the first person to say

2:27:38.480 --> 2:27:40.060
 maybe that was the way to go about it.

2:27:40.060 --> 2:27:42.540
 But the basic point is, look, the work was good.

2:27:43.760 --> 2:27:47.000
 It turned out to be highly predictive.

2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:50.120
 Frankly, the model of senescence that I presented

2:27:50.120 --> 2:27:52.000
 is now widely accepted.

2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:55.520
 And I don't feel any misgivings at all

2:27:55.520 --> 2:27:58.480
 about having spent a year on it, said my piece,

2:27:58.480 --> 2:28:00.040
 and moved on to other things

2:28:00.040 --> 2:28:02.320
 which frankly I think are bigger.

2:28:02.320 --> 2:28:03.680
 I think there's a lot of good to be done

2:28:03.680 --> 2:28:08.120
 and it would be a waste to get overly narrowly focused.

2:28:08.120 --> 2:28:12.920
 There's so many ways through the space of science

2:28:12.920 --> 2:28:16.800
 and the most common ways is just publish a lot.

2:28:16.800 --> 2:28:19.240
 Just publish a lot of papers, do these incremental work

2:28:19.240 --> 2:28:24.240
 and exploring the space kind of like ants looking for food.

2:28:24.240 --> 2:28:26.840
 You're tossing out a bunch of different ideas.

2:28:26.840 --> 2:28:29.800
 Some of them could be brilliant breakthrough ideas, nature.

2:28:29.800 --> 2:28:32.020
 Some of them are more confidence kind of publications,

2:28:32.020 --> 2:28:33.360
 all those kinds of things.

2:28:33.360 --> 2:28:37.440
 Did you consider that kind of path in science?

2:28:38.360 --> 2:28:39.760
 Of course I considered it,

2:28:39.760 --> 2:28:44.600
 but I must say the experience of having my first encounter

2:28:44.600 --> 2:28:48.720
 with the process of peer review be this story,

2:28:48.720 --> 2:28:52.460
 which was frankly a debacle from one end to the other

2:28:52.460 --> 2:28:54.680
 with respect to the process of publishing.

2:28:55.840 --> 2:28:58.800
 It did not, it was not a very good sales pitch

2:28:58.800 --> 2:29:01.480
 for trying to make a difference through publication.

2:29:01.480 --> 2:29:03.320
 And I would point out part of what I ran into

2:29:03.320 --> 2:29:06.920
 and I think frankly part of what explains Carol's behavior

2:29:06.920 --> 2:29:10.640
 is that in some parts of science,

2:29:10.640 --> 2:29:15.640
 there is this dynamic where PIs parasitize their underlings

2:29:16.560 --> 2:29:20.320
 and if you're very, very good, you rise to the level

2:29:20.320 --> 2:29:23.160
 where one day instead of being parasitized,

2:29:23.160 --> 2:29:25.320
 you get to parasitize others.

2:29:25.320 --> 2:29:27.520
 Now I find that scientifically despicable

2:29:28.360 --> 2:29:31.220
 and it wasn't the culture of the lab I grew up in at all.

2:29:31.220 --> 2:29:35.840
 My lab, in fact, the PI, Dick Alexander, who's now gone,

2:29:35.840 --> 2:29:40.400
 but who was an incredible mind and a great human being,

2:29:40.400 --> 2:29:42.520
 he didn't want his graduate students working

2:29:42.520 --> 2:29:44.280
 on the same topics he was on,

2:29:44.280 --> 2:29:47.480
 not because it wouldn't have been useful and exciting,

2:29:47.480 --> 2:29:51.240
 but because in effect, he did not want any confusion

2:29:51.240 --> 2:29:55.640
 about who had done what because he was a great mentor

2:29:55.640 --> 2:29:58.600
 and the idea was actually a great mentor

2:29:58.600 --> 2:30:02.360
 is not stealing ideas and you don't want people

2:30:02.360 --> 2:30:03.500
 thinking that they are.

2:30:03.500 --> 2:30:05.940
 So anyway, my point would be,

2:30:08.120 --> 2:30:11.200
 I wasn't up for being parasitized.

2:30:11.200 --> 2:30:14.440
 I don't like the idea that if you are very good,

2:30:14.440 --> 2:30:16.300
 you get parasitized until it's your turn

2:30:16.300 --> 2:30:17.700
 to parasitize others.

2:30:17.700 --> 2:30:19.200
 That doesn't make sense to me.

2:30:21.080 --> 2:30:23.680
 Crossing over from evolution into cellular biology

2:30:23.680 --> 2:30:25.440
 may have exposed me to that.

2:30:25.440 --> 2:30:26.960
 That may have been par for the course,

2:30:26.960 --> 2:30:29.800
 but it doesn't make it acceptable.

2:30:29.800 --> 2:30:33.120
 And I would also point out that my work falls

2:30:33.120 --> 2:30:35.500
 in the realm of synthesis.

2:30:36.500 --> 2:30:41.500
 My work generally takes evidence accumulated by others

2:30:41.500 --> 2:30:46.420
 and places it together in order to generate hypotheses

2:30:46.420 --> 2:30:48.660
 that explain sets of phenomena

2:30:48.660 --> 2:30:51.300
 that are otherwise intractable.

2:30:51.300 --> 2:30:55.260
 And I am not sure that that is best done

2:30:55.260 --> 2:30:59.700
 with narrow publications that are read by few.

2:30:59.700 --> 2:31:03.020
 And in fact, I would point to the very conspicuous example

2:31:03.020 --> 2:31:05.160
 of Richard Dawkins, who I must say I've learned

2:31:05.160 --> 2:31:07.940
 a tremendous amount from and I greatly admire.

2:31:07.940 --> 2:31:12.240
 Dawkins has almost no publication record

2:31:12.240 --> 2:31:15.720
 in the sense of peer reviewed papers in journals.

2:31:15.720 --> 2:31:18.160
 What he's done instead is done synthetic work

2:31:18.160 --> 2:31:19.580
 and he's published it in books,

2:31:19.580 --> 2:31:22.520
 which are not peer reviewed in the same sense.

2:31:22.520 --> 2:31:24.820
 And frankly, I think there's no doubting

2:31:24.820 --> 2:31:27.040
 his contribution to the field.

2:31:27.040 --> 2:31:32.040
 So my sense is if Richard Dawkins can illustrate

2:31:32.240 --> 2:31:34.380
 that one can make contributions to the field

2:31:34.380 --> 2:31:38.340
 without using journals as the primary mechanism

2:31:38.340 --> 2:31:40.560
 for distributing what you've come to understand,

2:31:40.560 --> 2:31:42.360
 then it's obviously a valid mechanism

2:31:42.360 --> 2:31:44.640
 and it's a far better one from the point of view

2:31:44.640 --> 2:31:46.380
 of accomplishing what I want to accomplish.

2:31:46.380 --> 2:31:47.880
 Yeah, it's really interesting.

2:31:47.880 --> 2:31:49.200
 There is of course several levels

2:31:49.200 --> 2:31:50.800
 you can do the kind of synthesis

2:31:50.800 --> 2:31:53.940
 and that does require a lot of both broad

2:31:53.940 --> 2:31:56.180
 and deep thinking is exceptionally valuable.

2:31:56.180 --> 2:31:58.880
 You could also, I'm working on something

2:31:58.880 --> 2:32:02.280
 with Andrew Huberman now, you can also publish synthesis.

2:32:02.280 --> 2:32:05.680
 That's like review papers that are exceptionally valuable

2:32:05.680 --> 2:32:06.720
 for the communities.

2:32:06.720 --> 2:32:09.400
 It brings the community together, tells a history,

2:32:09.400 --> 2:32:11.120
 tells a story of where the community has been.

2:32:11.120 --> 2:32:14.440
 It paints a picture of where the path lays for the future.

2:32:14.440 --> 2:32:15.600
 I think it's really valuable.

2:32:15.600 --> 2:32:17.440
 And Richard Dawkins is a good example

2:32:17.440 --> 2:32:19.280
 of somebody that does that in book form

2:32:20.280 --> 2:32:23.680
 that he kind of walks the line really interestingly.

2:32:23.680 --> 2:32:26.440
 You have like somebody who like Neil deGrasse Tyson,

2:32:26.440 --> 2:32:28.800
 who's more like a science communicator.

2:32:28.800 --> 2:32:31.000
 Richard Dawkins sometimes is a science communicator,

2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:34.000
 but he gets like close to the technical

2:32:34.000 --> 2:32:36.960
 to where it's a little bit, it's not shying away

2:32:36.960 --> 2:32:41.440
 from being really a contribution to science.

2:32:41.440 --> 2:32:44.140
 No, he's made real contributions.

2:32:44.140 --> 2:32:45.040
 In book form.

2:32:45.040 --> 2:32:46.600
 Yes, he really has.

2:32:46.600 --> 2:32:47.600
 Which is fascinating.

2:32:47.600 --> 2:32:51.640
 I mean, Roger Penrose, I mean, similar kind of idea.

2:32:51.640 --> 2:32:53.060
 That's interesting, that's interesting.

2:32:53.060 --> 2:32:56.480
 Synthesis does not, especially synthesis work,

2:32:56.480 --> 2:33:00.440
 work that synthesizes ideas does not necessarily need

2:33:00.440 --> 2:33:01.680
 to be peer reviewed.

2:33:03.280 --> 2:33:08.240
 It's peer reviewed by peers reading it.

2:33:08.240 --> 2:33:10.160
 Well, and reviewing it.

2:33:10.160 --> 2:33:11.720
 That's it, it is reviewed by peers,

2:33:11.720 --> 2:33:13.500
 which is not synonymous with peer review.

2:33:13.500 --> 2:33:15.600
 And that's the thing is people don't understand

2:33:15.600 --> 2:33:17.740
 that the two things aren't the same, right?

2:33:17.740 --> 2:33:20.240
 Peer review is an anonymous process

2:33:20.240 --> 2:33:23.360
 that happens before publication

2:33:23.360 --> 2:33:26.620
 in a place where there is a power dynamic, right?

2:33:26.620 --> 2:33:28.280
 I mean, the joke of course is that peer review

2:33:28.280 --> 2:33:30.360
 is actually peer preview, right?

2:33:30.360 --> 2:33:32.880
 Your biggest competitors get to see your work

2:33:32.880 --> 2:33:34.160
 before it sees the light of day

2:33:34.160 --> 2:33:37.260
 and decide whether or not it gets published.

2:33:37.260 --> 2:33:41.240
 And again, when your formative experience

2:33:41.240 --> 2:33:43.520
 with the publication apparatus is the one I had

2:33:43.520 --> 2:33:46.880
 with the telomere paper, there's no way

2:33:46.880 --> 2:33:48.300
 that that seems like the right way

2:33:48.300 --> 2:33:50.720
 to advance important ideas.

2:33:50.720 --> 2:33:54.000
 And what's the harm in publishing them

2:33:54.000 --> 2:33:55.900
 so that your peers have to review them in public

2:33:55.900 --> 2:33:58.600
 where they actually, if they're gonna disagree with you,

2:33:58.600 --> 2:34:00.580
 they actually have to take the risk of saying,

2:34:00.580 --> 2:34:03.380
 I don't think this is right and here's why, right?

2:34:03.380 --> 2:34:04.520
 With their name on it.

2:34:04.520 --> 2:34:05.540
 I'd much rather that.

2:34:05.540 --> 2:34:07.600
 It's not that I don't want my work reviewed by peers,

2:34:07.600 --> 2:34:10.220
 but I want it done in the open, you know,

2:34:10.220 --> 2:34:11.480
 for the same reason you don't meet

2:34:11.480 --> 2:34:14.640
 with dangerous people in private, you meet at the cafe.

2:34:14.640 --> 2:34:17.600
 I want the work reviewed out in public.

2:34:18.840 --> 2:34:20.840
 Can I ask you a difficult question?

2:34:20.840 --> 2:34:21.680
 Sure.

2:34:23.640 --> 2:34:26.640
 There is popularity in martyrdom.

2:34:26.640 --> 2:34:30.580
 There's popularity in pointing out

2:34:30.580 --> 2:34:32.140
 that the emperor has no clothes.

2:34:33.740 --> 2:34:36.140
 That can become a drug in itself.

2:34:40.980 --> 2:34:45.380
 I've confronted this in scientific work I've done at MIT

2:34:46.860 --> 2:34:49.900
 where there are certain things that are not done well.

2:34:49.900 --> 2:34:52.500
 People are not being the best version of themselves.

2:34:52.500 --> 2:34:57.500
 And particular aspects of a particular field

2:34:59.880 --> 2:35:02.280
 are in need of a revolution.

2:35:02.280 --> 2:35:06.280
 And part of me wanted to point that out

2:35:06.280 --> 2:35:11.280
 versus doing the hard work of publishing papers

2:35:11.280 --> 2:35:13.240
 and doing the revolution.

2:35:13.240 --> 2:35:15.040
 Basically just pointing out, look,

2:35:15.920 --> 2:35:19.320
 you guys are doing it wrong and then just walking away.

2:35:19.320 --> 2:35:23.360
 Are you aware of the drug of martyrdom,

2:35:23.360 --> 2:35:28.360
 of the ego involved in it,

2:35:29.760 --> 2:35:31.500
 that it can cloud your thinking?

2:35:32.700 --> 2:35:35.840
 Probably one of the best questions I've ever been asked.

2:35:35.840 --> 2:35:38.300
 So let me try to sort it out.

2:35:39.360 --> 2:35:43.560
 First of all, we are all mysteries to ourself at some level.

2:35:43.560 --> 2:35:46.240
 So it's possible there's stuff going on in me

2:35:46.240 --> 2:35:48.320
 that I'm not aware of that's driving.

2:35:48.320 --> 2:35:52.080
 But in general, I would say one of my better strengths

2:35:52.080 --> 2:35:54.280
 is that I'm not especially ego driven.

2:35:55.280 --> 2:35:58.540
 I have an ego, I clearly think highly of myself,

2:35:58.540 --> 2:36:00.300
 but it is not driving me.

2:36:00.300 --> 2:36:03.220
 I do not crave that kind of validation.

2:36:03.220 --> 2:36:05.000
 I do crave certain things.

2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:07.880
 I do love a good eureka moment.

2:36:07.880 --> 2:36:09.360
 There is something great about it.

2:36:09.360 --> 2:36:11.720
 And there's something even better about the phone calls

2:36:11.720 --> 2:36:14.280
 you make next when you share it, right?

2:36:14.280 --> 2:36:15.840
 It's pretty fun, right?

2:36:15.840 --> 2:36:17.380
 I really like it.

2:36:17.380 --> 2:36:20.880
 I also really like my subject, right?

2:36:20.880 --> 2:36:23.800
 There's something about a walk in the forest

2:36:23.800 --> 2:36:26.920
 when you have a toolkit in which you can actually look

2:36:26.920 --> 2:36:30.740
 at creatures and see something deep, right?

2:36:30.740 --> 2:36:33.060
 I like it, that drives me.

2:36:33.060 --> 2:36:35.880
 And I could entertain myself for the rest of my life, right?

2:36:35.880 --> 2:36:39.800
 If I was somehow isolated from the rest of the world,

2:36:39.800 --> 2:36:42.920
 but I was in a place that was biologically interesting,

2:36:42.920 --> 2:36:45.960
 hopefully I would be with people that I love

2:36:45.960 --> 2:36:48.360
 and pets that I love, believe it or not.

2:36:48.360 --> 2:36:51.600
 But if I were in that situation and I could just go out

2:36:51.600 --> 2:36:54.000
 every day and look at cool stuff and figure out

2:36:54.000 --> 2:36:56.680
 what it means, I could be all right with that.

2:36:56.680 --> 2:37:01.680
 So I'm not heavily driven by the ego thing, as you put it.

2:37:02.680 --> 2:37:07.440
 So I am completely the same except instead of the pets,

2:37:07.440 --> 2:37:08.520
 I would put robots.

2:37:08.520 --> 2:37:12.000
 But so it's not, it's the eureka, it's the exploration

2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:16.040
 of the subject that brings you joy and fulfillment.

2:37:16.040 --> 2:37:17.840
 It's not the ego.

2:37:17.840 --> 2:37:18.880
 Well, there's more to say.

2:37:18.880 --> 2:37:21.480
 No, I really don't think it's the ego thing.

2:37:21.480 --> 2:37:24.200
 I will say I also have kind of a secondary passion

2:37:24.200 --> 2:37:25.140
 for robot stuff.

2:37:25.140 --> 2:37:29.000
 I've never made anything useful, but I do believe,

2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:30.640
 I believe I found my calling.

2:37:30.640 --> 2:37:32.320
 But if this wasn't my calling,

2:37:32.320 --> 2:37:34.460
 my calling would have been inventing stuff.

2:37:34.460 --> 2:37:36.120
 I really enjoy that too.

2:37:36.120 --> 2:37:39.920
 So I get what you're saying about the analogy quite well.

2:37:39.920 --> 2:37:43.080
 But as far as the martyrdom thing,

2:37:46.440 --> 2:37:47.920
 I understand the drug you're talking about

2:37:47.920 --> 2:37:51.000
 and I've seen it more than I've felt it.

2:37:51.000 --> 2:37:53.760
 I do, if I'm just to be completely candid

2:37:53.760 --> 2:37:57.640
 and this question is so good, it deserves a candid answer.

2:37:57.640 --> 2:38:01.960
 I do like the fight, right?

2:38:01.960 --> 2:38:04.720
 I like fighting against people I don't respect

2:38:04.720 --> 2:38:09.720
 and I like winning, but I have no interest in martyrdom.

2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:12.680
 One of the reasons I have no interest in martyrdom

2:38:12.680 --> 2:38:15.300
 is that I'm having too good a time, right?

2:38:15.300 --> 2:38:17.560
 I very much enjoy my life and.

2:38:17.560 --> 2:38:18.760
 It's such a good answer.

2:38:18.760 --> 2:38:21.240
 I have a wonderful wife.

2:38:21.240 --> 2:38:23.420
 I have amazing children.

2:38:23.420 --> 2:38:26.040
 I live in a lovely place.

2:38:26.040 --> 2:38:29.440
 I don't wanna exit any quicker than I have to.

2:38:29.440 --> 2:38:32.240
 That said, I also believe in things

2:38:32.240 --> 2:38:35.600
 and a willingness to exit if that's the only way

2:38:35.600 --> 2:38:37.840
 is not exactly inviting martyrdom,

2:38:37.840 --> 2:38:41.260
 but it is an acceptance that fighting is dangerous

2:38:41.260 --> 2:38:43.720
 and going up against powerful forces

2:38:43.720 --> 2:38:46.040
 means who knows what will come of it, right?

2:38:46.040 --> 2:38:48.840
 I don't have the sense that the thing is out there

2:38:48.840 --> 2:38:51.440
 that used to kill inconvenient people.

2:38:51.440 --> 2:38:52.880
 I don't think that's how it's done anymore.

2:38:52.880 --> 2:38:56.880
 It's primarily done through destroying them reputationally,

2:38:56.880 --> 2:39:00.520
 which is not something I relish the possibility of,

2:39:00.520 --> 2:39:03.440
 but there is a difference between

2:39:03.440 --> 2:39:07.800
 a willingness to face the hazard

2:39:07.800 --> 2:39:12.800
 rather than a desire to face it because of the thrill, right?

2:39:13.560 --> 2:39:18.560
 For me, the thrill is in fighting when I'm in the right.

2:39:19.600 --> 2:39:22.320
 I think I feel that that is a worthwhile way

2:39:22.320 --> 2:39:27.320
 to take what I see as the kind of brutality

2:39:27.320 --> 2:39:30.560
 that is built into men and to channel it

2:39:30.560 --> 2:39:33.520
 to something useful, right?

2:39:33.520 --> 2:39:35.240
 If it is not channeled into something useful,

2:39:35.240 --> 2:39:36.520
 it will be channeled into something else,

2:39:36.520 --> 2:39:38.880
 so it damn well better be channeled into something useful.

2:39:38.880 --> 2:39:41.040
 It's not motivated by fame or popularity,

2:39:41.040 --> 2:39:42.040
 those kinds of things.

2:39:42.040 --> 2:39:45.840
 It's, you know what, you're just making me realize

2:39:45.840 --> 2:39:47.760
 that enjoying the fight,

2:39:50.440 --> 2:39:53.240
 fighting the powerful and idea that you believe is right

2:39:53.240 --> 2:39:58.240
 is a kind of optimism for the human spirit.

2:40:01.640 --> 2:40:04.360
 It's like, we can win this.

2:40:05.520 --> 2:40:08.000
 It's almost like you're turning into action,

2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:13.000
 into personal action, this hope for humanity

2:40:13.480 --> 2:40:15.720
 by saying like, we can win this.

2:40:15.720 --> 2:40:20.720
 And that makes you feel good about the rest of humanity,

2:40:20.720 --> 2:40:25.720
 that if there's people like me, then we're going to be okay.

2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:29.480
 Even if you're like, your ideas might be wrong or not,

2:40:29.480 --> 2:40:31.520
 but if you believe they're right

2:40:31.520 --> 2:40:36.080
 and you're fighting the powerful against all odds,

2:40:36.080 --> 2:40:37.640
 then we're going to be okay.

2:40:39.960 --> 2:40:42.480
 If I were to project, I mean,

2:40:42.480 --> 2:40:44.320
 because I enjoy the fight as well,

2:40:44.320 --> 2:40:48.080
 I think that's the way I, that's what brings me joy,

2:40:48.080 --> 2:40:53.080
 is it's almost like it's optimism in action.

2:40:54.200 --> 2:40:55.600
 Well, it's a little different for me.

2:40:55.600 --> 2:40:58.440
 And again, I think, you know, I recognize you.

2:40:58.440 --> 2:41:01.000
 You're a familiar, your construction is familiar,

2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:02.600
 even if it isn't mine, right?

2:41:03.800 --> 2:41:08.320
 For me, I actually expect us not to be okay.

2:41:08.320 --> 2:41:10.160
 And I'm not okay with that.

2:41:10.160 --> 2:41:14.400
 But what's really important, if I feel like what I've said

2:41:14.400 --> 2:41:17.320
 is I don't know of any reason that it's not okay,

2:41:17.320 --> 2:41:19.720
 or any reason that it's too late.

2:41:19.720 --> 2:41:22.560
 As far as I know, we could still save humanity

2:41:22.560 --> 2:41:24.040
 and we could get to the fourth frontier

2:41:24.040 --> 2:41:26.280
 or something akin to it.

2:41:26.280 --> 2:41:29.960
 But I expect us not to, I expect us to fuck it up, right?

2:41:29.960 --> 2:41:32.360
 I don't like that thought, but I've looked into the abyss

2:41:32.360 --> 2:41:34.480
 and I've done my calculations

2:41:34.480 --> 2:41:38.920
 and the number of ways we could not succeed are many

2:41:38.920 --> 2:41:40.920
 and the number of ways that we could manage

2:41:40.920 --> 2:41:44.040
 to get out of this very dangerous phase of history is small.

2:41:44.040 --> 2:41:47.440
 The thing I don't have to worry about is

2:41:47.440 --> 2:41:50.520
 that I didn't do enough, right?

2:41:50.520 --> 2:41:55.520
 That I was a coward, that I prioritized other things.

2:41:57.160 --> 2:41:59.240
 At the end of the day, I think I will be able to say

2:41:59.240 --> 2:42:02.120
 to myself, and in fact, the thing that allows me to sleep,

2:42:02.120 --> 2:42:05.600
 is that when I saw clearly what needed to be done,

2:42:05.600 --> 2:42:08.400
 I tried to do it to the extent that it was in my power.

2:42:08.400 --> 2:42:12.720
 And if we fail, as I expect us to,

2:42:12.720 --> 2:42:16.160
 I can't say, well, geez, that's on me, you know?

2:42:16.160 --> 2:42:18.400
 And frankly, I regard what I just said to you

2:42:18.400 --> 2:42:22.160
 as something like a personality defect, right?

2:42:22.160 --> 2:42:24.240
 I'm trying to free myself from the sense

2:42:24.240 --> 2:42:25.760
 that this is my fault.

2:42:25.760 --> 2:42:28.160
 On the other hand, my guess is that personality defect

2:42:28.160 --> 2:42:31.320
 is probably good for humanity, right?

2:42:31.320 --> 2:42:34.880
 It's a good one for me to have the externalities

2:42:34.880 --> 2:42:38.640
 of it are positive, so I don't feel too bad about it.

2:42:38.640 --> 2:42:42.920
 Yeah, that's funny, so yeah, our perspective on the world

2:42:42.920 --> 2:42:45.160
 are different, but they rhyme, like you said.

2:42:45.160 --> 2:42:47.600
 Because I've also looked into the abyss,

2:42:47.600 --> 2:42:51.640
 and it kind of smiled nervously back.

2:42:51.640 --> 2:42:55.720
 So I have a more optimistic sense that we're gonna win

2:42:55.720 --> 2:42:58.080
 more than likely we're going to be okay.

2:42:59.240 --> 2:43:00.160
 Right there with you, brother.

2:43:00.160 --> 2:43:01.560
 I'm hoping you're right.

2:43:01.560 --> 2:43:03.720
 I'm expecting me to be right.

2:43:03.720 --> 2:43:07.280
 But back to Eric, you had a wonderful conversation.

2:43:07.280 --> 2:43:11.080
 In that conversation, he played the big brother role,

2:43:11.080 --> 2:43:13.280
 and he was very happy about it.

2:43:13.280 --> 2:43:15.480
 He was self congratulatory about it.

2:43:17.080 --> 2:43:21.280
 Can you talk to the ways in which Eric made you

2:43:21.280 --> 2:43:24.040
 a better man throughout your life?

2:43:24.040 --> 2:43:25.600
 Yeah, hell yeah.

2:43:25.600 --> 2:43:27.920
 I mean, for one thing, you know,

2:43:27.920 --> 2:43:30.960
 Eric and I are interestingly similar in some ways

2:43:30.960 --> 2:43:33.080
 and radically different in some other ways,

2:43:33.080 --> 2:43:35.760
 and it's often a matter of fascination

2:43:35.760 --> 2:43:38.000
 to people who know us both because almost always

2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:40.040
 people meet one of us first, and they sort of

2:43:40.040 --> 2:43:41.800
 get used to that thing, and then they meet the other,

2:43:41.800 --> 2:43:44.400
 and it throws the model into chaos.

2:43:44.400 --> 2:43:47.080
 But you know, I had a great advantage,

2:43:47.080 --> 2:43:49.440
 which is I came second, right?

2:43:49.440 --> 2:43:51.800
 So although it was kind of a pain in the ass

2:43:51.800 --> 2:43:53.760
 to be born into a world that had Eric in it

2:43:53.760 --> 2:43:55.920
 because he's a force of nature, right?

2:43:55.920 --> 2:43:59.520
 It was also terrifically useful because A,

2:43:59.520 --> 2:44:02.640
 he was a very awesome older brother

2:44:02.640 --> 2:44:06.000
 who made interesting mistakes, learned from them,

2:44:06.000 --> 2:44:08.760
 and conveyed the wisdom of what he had discovered,

2:44:08.760 --> 2:44:12.640
 and that was, you know, I don't know who else

2:44:12.640 --> 2:44:16.120
 ends up so lucky as to have that kind of person

2:44:16.120 --> 2:44:18.000
 blazing the trail.

2:44:18.000 --> 2:44:22.520
 It also probably, you know, my hypothesis

2:44:22.520 --> 2:44:24.840
 for what birth order effects are

2:44:24.840 --> 2:44:27.960
 is that they're actually adaptive, right?

2:44:27.960 --> 2:44:30.680
 That the reason that a second born is different

2:44:30.680 --> 2:44:32.840
 than a first born is that they're not born

2:44:32.840 --> 2:44:35.560
 into a world with the same niches in it, right?

2:44:35.560 --> 2:44:38.240
 And so the thing about Eric is he's been

2:44:38.240 --> 2:44:43.240
 completely dominant in the realm of fundamental thinking,

2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:45.800
 right, like what he's fascinated by

2:44:45.800 --> 2:44:48.400
 is the fundamental of fundamentals,

2:44:48.400 --> 2:44:50.520
 and he's excellent at it, which meant

2:44:50.520 --> 2:44:52.080
 that I was born into a world where somebody

2:44:52.080 --> 2:44:54.320
 was becoming excellent in that, and for me

2:44:54.320 --> 2:44:57.160
 to be anywhere near the fundamental of fundamentals

2:44:57.160 --> 2:44:58.760
 was going to be pointless, right?

2:44:58.760 --> 2:45:00.880
 I was going to be playing second fiddle forever,

2:45:00.880 --> 2:45:02.520
 and I think that that actually drove me

2:45:02.520 --> 2:45:04.640
 to the other end of the continuum

2:45:04.640 --> 2:45:06.560
 between fundamental and emergent,

2:45:06.560 --> 2:45:09.120
 and so I became fascinated with biology

2:45:09.120 --> 2:45:13.480
 and have been since I was three years old, right?

2:45:13.480 --> 2:45:16.920
 I think Eric drove that, and I have to thank him for it

2:45:16.920 --> 2:45:19.280
 because, you know, I mean.

2:45:19.280 --> 2:45:24.040
 I never thought of, so Eric drives towards the fundamental,

2:45:24.040 --> 2:45:26.360
 and you drive towards the emergent,

2:45:26.360 --> 2:45:28.160
 the physics and the biology.

2:45:28.160 --> 2:45:30.040
 Right, opposite ends of the continuum,

2:45:30.040 --> 2:45:32.600
 and as Eric would be quick to point out

2:45:32.600 --> 2:45:36.120
 if he was sitting here, I treat the emergent layer,

2:45:36.120 --> 2:45:37.720
 I seek the fundamentals in it,

2:45:37.720 --> 2:45:40.320
 which is sort of an echo of Eric's style of thinking

2:45:40.320 --> 2:45:43.440
 but applied to the very far complexity.

2:45:43.440 --> 2:45:48.440
 He's overpoweringly argues for the importance of physics,

2:45:50.360 --> 2:45:52.120
 the fundamental of the fundamental.

2:45:55.320 --> 2:45:57.360
 He's not here to defend himself.

2:45:57.360 --> 2:46:00.200
 Is there an argument to be made against that?

2:46:00.200 --> 2:46:03.040
 Or biology, the emergent,

2:46:03.040 --> 2:46:06.800
 the study of the thing that emerged

2:46:06.800 --> 2:46:10.800
 when the fundamental acts at the cosmic scale

2:46:10.800 --> 2:46:13.200
 and then builds the beautiful thing that is us

2:46:13.200 --> 2:46:14.400
 is much more important.

2:46:16.160 --> 2:46:19.840
 Psychology, biology, the systems

2:46:19.840 --> 2:46:23.440
 that we're actually interacting with in this human world

2:46:23.440 --> 2:46:25.440
 are much more important to understand

2:46:25.440 --> 2:46:30.440
 than the low level theories of quantum mechanics

2:46:31.720 --> 2:46:33.760
 and general relativity.

2:46:33.760 --> 2:46:35.720
 Yeah, I can't say that one is more important.

2:46:35.720 --> 2:46:38.400
 I think there's probably a different time scale.

2:46:38.400 --> 2:46:40.760
 I think understanding the emergent layer

2:46:40.760 --> 2:46:44.880
 is more often useful, but the bang for the buck

2:46:44.880 --> 2:46:48.400
 at the far fundamental layer may be much greater.

2:46:48.400 --> 2:46:51.240
 So for example, the fourth frontier,

2:46:51.240 --> 2:46:55.640
 I'm pretty sure it's gonna have to be fusion powered.

2:46:55.640 --> 2:46:57.200
 I don't think anything else will do it,

2:46:57.200 --> 2:46:58.800
 but once you had fusion power,

2:46:58.800 --> 2:47:01.400
 assuming we didn't just dump fusion power on the market

2:47:01.400 --> 2:47:02.600
 the way we would be likely to

2:47:02.600 --> 2:47:05.680
 if it was invented usefully tomorrow,

2:47:05.680 --> 2:47:08.520
 but if we had fusion power

2:47:08.520 --> 2:47:10.920
 and we had a little bit more wisdom than we have,

2:47:10.920 --> 2:47:12.000
 you could do an awful lot.

2:47:12.000 --> 2:47:15.360
 And that's not gonna come from people like me

2:47:15.360 --> 2:47:17.960
 who look at the dynamics of it.

2:47:17.960 --> 2:47:19.400
 Can I argue against that?

2:47:19.400 --> 2:47:21.240
 Please.

2:47:21.240 --> 2:47:25.680
 I think the way to unlock fusion power

2:47:25.680 --> 2:47:27.520
 is through artificial intelligence.

2:47:28.840 --> 2:47:32.560
 So I think most of the breakthrough ideas

2:47:32.560 --> 2:47:35.960
 in the futures of science will be developed by AI systems.

2:47:35.960 --> 2:47:38.960
 And I think in order to build intelligent AI systems,

2:47:38.960 --> 2:47:41.440
 you have to be a scholar of the fundamental

2:47:41.440 --> 2:47:46.440
 of the emergent, of biology, of the neuroscience,

2:47:46.440 --> 2:47:48.960
 of the way the brain works,

2:47:48.960 --> 2:47:50.960
 of intelligence, of consciousness.

2:47:50.960 --> 2:47:53.800
 And those things, at least directly,

2:47:53.800 --> 2:47:56.120
 don't have anything to do with physics.

2:47:56.120 --> 2:47:56.960
 Well.

2:47:56.960 --> 2:47:58.240
 You're making me a little bit sad

2:47:58.240 --> 2:48:02.080
 because my addiction to the aha moment thing

2:48:02.080 --> 2:48:06.760
 is incompatible with outsourcing that job.

2:48:06.760 --> 2:48:07.600
 Like the outsource thing.

2:48:07.600 --> 2:48:09.280
 I don't wanna outsource that thing to the AI.

2:48:09.280 --> 2:48:11.520
 You reap the moment.

2:48:11.520 --> 2:48:13.240
 And actually, I've seen this happen before

2:48:13.240 --> 2:48:16.400
 because some of the people who trained Heather and me

2:48:16.400 --> 2:48:19.360
 were phylogenetic systematists,

2:48:19.360 --> 2:48:21.720
 Arnold Kluge in particular.

2:48:21.720 --> 2:48:24.920
 And the problem with systematics

2:48:24.920 --> 2:48:28.760
 is that to do it right when your technology is primitive,

2:48:28.760 --> 2:48:32.000
 you have to be deeply embedded in the philosophical

2:48:32.000 --> 2:48:33.960
 and the logical, right?

2:48:33.960 --> 2:48:38.960
 Your method has to be based in the highest level of rigor.

2:48:40.200 --> 2:48:42.360
 Once you can sequence genes,

2:48:42.360 --> 2:48:44.120
 genes can spit so much data at you

2:48:44.120 --> 2:48:46.800
 that you can overwhelm high quality work

2:48:46.800 --> 2:48:49.960
 with just lots and lots and lots of automated work.

2:48:49.960 --> 2:48:51.760
 And so in some sense,

2:48:51.760 --> 2:48:54.960
 there's like a generation of phylogenetic systematists

2:48:54.960 --> 2:48:56.640
 who are the last of the greats

2:48:56.640 --> 2:48:58.880
 because what's replacing them is sequencers.

2:48:59.760 --> 2:49:03.120
 So anyway, maybe you're right about the AI.

2:49:03.120 --> 2:49:03.960
 And I guess I'm...

2:49:03.960 --> 2:49:04.800
 What makes you sad?

2:49:06.200 --> 2:49:07.960
 I like figuring stuff out.

2:49:07.960 --> 2:49:11.240
 Is there something that you disagree with the error con,

2:49:11.240 --> 2:49:14.840
 even trying to convince them you failed so far,

2:49:14.840 --> 2:49:17.720
 but you will eventually succeed?

2:49:18.600 --> 2:49:20.600
 You know, that is a very long list.

2:49:20.600 --> 2:49:24.120
 Eric and I have tensions over certain things

2:49:24.120 --> 2:49:26.960
 that recur all the time.

2:49:26.960 --> 2:49:29.760
 And I'm trying to think what would be the ideal...

2:49:29.760 --> 2:49:30.840
 Is it in the space of science,

2:49:30.840 --> 2:49:35.840
 in the space of philosophy, politics, family, love, robots?

2:49:35.840 --> 2:49:39.760
 Well, all right, let me...

2:49:39.760 --> 2:49:42.480
 I'm just gonna use your podcast

2:49:42.480 --> 2:49:44.760
 to make a bit of a cryptic war

2:49:44.760 --> 2:49:47.120
 and just say there are many places

2:49:47.120 --> 2:49:50.720
 in which I believe that I have butted heads with Eric

2:49:50.720 --> 2:49:52.360
 over the course of decades

2:49:52.360 --> 2:49:55.040
 and I have seen him move in my direction

2:49:55.040 --> 2:49:56.320
 substantially over time.

2:49:56.320 --> 2:49:57.560
 So you've been winning.

2:49:57.560 --> 2:49:59.480
 He might win a battle here or there,

2:49:59.480 --> 2:50:00.600
 but you've been winning the war.

2:50:00.600 --> 2:50:01.840
 I would not say that.

2:50:01.840 --> 2:50:04.800
 It's quite possible he could say the same thing about me.

2:50:04.800 --> 2:50:06.240
 And in fact, I know that it's true.

2:50:06.240 --> 2:50:08.440
 There are places where he's absolutely convinced me.

2:50:08.440 --> 2:50:11.880
 But in any case, I do believe it's at least...

2:50:11.880 --> 2:50:13.240
 It may not be a totally even fight,

2:50:13.240 --> 2:50:15.360
 but it's more even than some will imagine.

2:50:16.480 --> 2:50:17.600
 But yeah, we have...

2:50:18.920 --> 2:50:22.680
 There are things I say that drive him nuts, right?

2:50:22.680 --> 2:50:27.280
 Like when something, like you heard me talk about the...

2:50:28.400 --> 2:50:29.560
 What was it?

2:50:29.560 --> 2:50:33.880
 It was the autopilot that seems to be putting

2:50:33.880 --> 2:50:37.240
 a great many humans in needless medical jeopardy

2:50:37.240 --> 2:50:40.360
 over the COVID 19 pandemic.

2:50:40.360 --> 2:50:44.480
 And my feeling is we can say this almost for sure.

2:50:45.520 --> 2:50:47.080
 Anytime you have the appearance

2:50:47.080 --> 2:50:50.720
 of some captured gigantic entity

2:50:50.720 --> 2:50:52.960
 that is censoring you on YouTube

2:50:52.960 --> 2:50:56.840
 and handing down dictates from the who and all of that,

2:50:56.840 --> 2:50:59.240
 it is sure that there will be

2:50:59.240 --> 2:51:01.360
 a certain amount of collusion, right?

2:51:01.360 --> 2:51:04.000
 There's gonna be some embarrassing emails in some places

2:51:04.000 --> 2:51:05.880
 that are gonna reveal some shocking connections.

2:51:05.880 --> 2:51:09.520
 And then there's gonna be an awful lot of emergence

2:51:09.520 --> 2:51:11.400
 that didn't involve collusion, right?

2:51:11.400 --> 2:51:13.480
 In which people were doing their little part of a job

2:51:13.480 --> 2:51:14.480
 and something was emerging.

2:51:14.480 --> 2:51:16.800
 And you never know what the admixture is.

2:51:16.800 --> 2:51:19.600
 How much are we looking at actual collusion

2:51:19.600 --> 2:51:21.560
 and how much are we looking at an emergent process?

2:51:21.560 --> 2:51:23.600
 But you should always walk in with the sense

2:51:23.600 --> 2:51:24.840
 that it's gonna be a ratio.

2:51:24.840 --> 2:51:27.680
 And the question is, what is the ratio in this case?

2:51:27.680 --> 2:51:29.840
 I think this drives Eric nuts

2:51:29.840 --> 2:51:32.480
 because he is very focused on the people.

2:51:32.480 --> 2:51:34.960
 I think he's focused on the people who have a choice

2:51:34.960 --> 2:51:36.880
 and make the wrong one.

2:51:36.880 --> 2:51:38.600
 And anyway, he may.

2:51:38.600 --> 2:51:41.320
 Discussion of the ratio is a distraction to that.

2:51:41.320 --> 2:51:45.000
 I think he takes it almost as an offense

2:51:45.000 --> 2:51:50.000
 because it grants cover to people who are harming others.

2:51:51.440 --> 2:51:56.120
 And I think it offends him morally.

2:51:56.120 --> 2:52:00.280
 And if I had to say, I would say it alters his judgment

2:52:00.280 --> 2:52:01.120
 on the matter.

2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:05.280
 But anyway, certainly useful just to leave open

2:52:05.280 --> 2:52:07.280
 the two possibilities and say it's a ratio,

2:52:07.280 --> 2:52:08.680
 but we don't know which one.

2:52:10.440 --> 2:52:13.280
 Brother to brother, do you love the guy?

2:52:13.280 --> 2:52:15.480
 Hmm, hell yeah, hell yeah.

2:52:15.480 --> 2:52:18.200
 And I'd love him if he was just my brother,

2:52:18.200 --> 2:52:19.240
 but he's also awesome.

2:52:19.240 --> 2:52:21.960
 So I love him and I love him for who he is.

2:52:21.960 --> 2:52:25.920
 So let me ask you about back to your book,

2:52:25.920 --> 2:52:29.680
 Hunter Gatherer's Guide to the 21st Century.

2:52:29.680 --> 2:52:32.480
 I can't wait both for the book and the videos

2:52:32.480 --> 2:52:33.720
 you do on the book.

2:52:33.720 --> 2:52:35.880
 That's really exciting that there's like a structured,

2:52:35.880 --> 2:52:37.680
 organized way to present this.

2:52:39.760 --> 2:52:44.640
 A kind of from an evolutionary biology perspective,

2:52:44.640 --> 2:52:46.680
 a guide for the future,

2:52:46.680 --> 2:52:51.680
 using our past as the fundamental, the emergent way

2:52:52.360 --> 2:52:54.760
 to present a picture of the future.

2:52:56.160 --> 2:52:59.160
 Let me ask you about something that,

2:53:00.880 --> 2:53:02.720
 I think about a little bit in this modern world,

2:53:02.720 --> 2:53:03.800
 which is monogamy.

2:53:07.600 --> 2:53:10.200
 So I personally value monogamy.

2:53:10.200 --> 2:53:12.440
 One girl, ride or die.

2:53:12.440 --> 2:53:13.560
 There you go.

2:53:13.560 --> 2:53:15.480
 Ride or, no, that's exactly it now.

2:53:15.480 --> 2:53:20.480
 But that said, I don't know what's the right way

2:53:21.720 --> 2:53:23.120
 to approach this,

2:53:23.120 --> 2:53:27.200
 but from an evolutionary biology perspective

2:53:27.200 --> 2:53:30.120
 or from just looking at modern society,

2:53:30.120 --> 2:53:32.520
 that seems to be an idea that's not,

2:53:33.640 --> 2:53:35.840
 what's the right way to put it, flourishing?

2:53:37.480 --> 2:53:38.400
 It is waning.

2:53:38.400 --> 2:53:39.240
 It's waning.

2:53:41.120 --> 2:53:44.120
 So I suppose based on your reaction,

2:53:44.120 --> 2:53:45.880
 you're also a supporter of monogamy

2:53:45.880 --> 2:53:47.920
 or you value monogamy.

2:53:47.920 --> 2:53:51.160
 Are you and I just delusional?

2:53:53.720 --> 2:53:56.400
 What can you say about monogamy

2:53:56.400 --> 2:53:58.280
 from the context of your book,

2:53:58.280 --> 2:54:00.640
 from the context of evolutionary biology,

2:54:00.640 --> 2:54:02.560
 from the context of being human?

2:54:02.560 --> 2:54:05.040
 Yeah, I can say that I fully believe

2:54:05.040 --> 2:54:06.600
 that we are actually enlightened

2:54:06.600 --> 2:54:09.360
 and that although monogamy is waning,

2:54:09.360 --> 2:54:12.320
 that it is not waning because there is a superior system.

2:54:12.320 --> 2:54:15.400
 It is waning for predictable other reasons.

2:54:15.400 --> 2:54:18.480
 So let us just say it is,

2:54:18.480 --> 2:54:21.920
 there is a lot of pre trans fallacy here

2:54:21.920 --> 2:54:24.880
 where people go through a phase

2:54:24.880 --> 2:54:26.760
 where they recognize that actually

2:54:26.760 --> 2:54:31.760
 we know a lot about the evolution of monogamy

2:54:31.840 --> 2:54:33.480
 and we can tell from the fact

2:54:33.480 --> 2:54:36.720
 that humans are somewhat sexually dimorphic

2:54:36.720 --> 2:54:39.480
 that there has been a lot of polygyny in human history.

2:54:39.480 --> 2:54:44.480
 And in fact, most of human history was largely polygynous.

2:54:45.120 --> 2:54:48.760
 But it is also the case that most of the people

2:54:48.760 --> 2:54:51.200
 on earth today belong to civilizations

2:54:51.200 --> 2:54:53.040
 that are at least nominally monogamous

2:54:53.040 --> 2:54:54.640
 and have practiced monogamy.

2:54:54.640 --> 2:54:58.040
 And that's not anti evolutionary.

2:54:58.040 --> 2:55:01.360
 What that is is part of what I mentioned before

2:55:01.360 --> 2:55:05.280
 where human beings can swap out their software program

2:55:05.280 --> 2:55:09.880
 and different mating patterns are favored

2:55:09.880 --> 2:55:11.960
 in different periods of history.

2:55:11.960 --> 2:55:15.160
 So I would argue that the benefit of monogamy,

2:55:15.160 --> 2:55:17.360
 the primary one that drives the evolution

2:55:17.360 --> 2:55:19.560
 of monogamous patterns in humans

2:55:19.560 --> 2:55:23.520
 is that it brings all adults into child rearing.

2:55:24.840 --> 2:55:26.640
 Now the reason that that matters

2:55:26.640 --> 2:55:29.880
 is because human babies are very labor intensive.

2:55:29.880 --> 2:55:31.120
 In order to raise them properly,

2:55:31.120 --> 2:55:34.040
 having two parents is a huge asset

2:55:34.040 --> 2:55:35.440
 and having more than two parents,

2:55:35.440 --> 2:55:38.720
 having an extended family also very important.

2:55:39.720 --> 2:55:43.480
 But what that means is that for a population

2:55:43.480 --> 2:55:48.000
 that is expanding, a monogamous mating system makes sense.

2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:50.720
 It makes sense because it means that the number of offspring

2:55:50.720 --> 2:55:52.840
 that can be raised is elevated.

2:55:52.840 --> 2:55:56.280
 It's elevated because all potential parents

2:55:56.280 --> 2:55:58.080
 are involved in parenting.

2:55:58.080 --> 2:56:00.160
 Whereas if you sideline a bunch of males

2:56:00.160 --> 2:56:01.520
 by having a polygynous system

2:56:01.520 --> 2:56:03.240
 in which one male has many females,

2:56:03.240 --> 2:56:05.360
 which is typically the way that works,

2:56:05.360 --> 2:56:07.040
 what you do is you sideline all those males,

2:56:07.040 --> 2:56:09.960
 which means the total amount of parental effort is lower

2:56:09.960 --> 2:56:12.160
 and the population can't grow.

2:56:12.160 --> 2:56:15.680
 So what I'm arguing is that you should expect to see

2:56:16.920 --> 2:56:20.640
 populations that face the possibility of expansion

2:56:20.640 --> 2:56:21.880
 endorse monogamy.

2:56:21.880 --> 2:56:24.000
 And at the point that they have reached carrying capacity,

2:56:24.000 --> 2:56:26.480
 you should expect to see polygyny break back out.

2:56:26.480 --> 2:56:28.120
 And what we are seeing

2:56:28.120 --> 2:56:31.600
 is a kind of false sophistication around polyamory,

2:56:31.600 --> 2:56:35.080
 which will end up breaking down into polygyny,

2:56:35.080 --> 2:56:37.560
 which will not be in the interest of most people.

2:56:37.560 --> 2:56:38.920
 Really the only people whose interest

2:56:38.920 --> 2:56:41.200
 it could be argued to be in

2:56:41.200 --> 2:56:44.320
 would be the very small number of males at the top

2:56:44.320 --> 2:56:48.960
 who have many partners and everybody else suffers.

2:56:48.960 --> 2:56:51.240
 Is it possible to make the argument

2:56:51.240 --> 2:56:55.040
 if we focus in on those males at the quote unquote top

2:56:55.040 --> 2:56:57.640
 with many female partners,

2:56:57.640 --> 2:57:02.280
 is it possible to say that that's a suboptimal life,

2:57:02.280 --> 2:57:05.240
 that a single partner is the optimal life?

2:57:05.240 --> 2:57:06.320
 Well, it depends what you mean.

2:57:06.320 --> 2:57:09.280
 I have a feeling that you and I wouldn't have to go very far

2:57:09.280 --> 2:57:14.280
 to figure out that what might be evolutionarily optimal

2:57:15.080 --> 2:57:17.280
 doesn't match my values as a person

2:57:17.280 --> 2:57:20.200
 and I'm sure it doesn't match yours either.

2:57:20.200 --> 2:57:23.200
 Can we try to dig into that gap between those two?

2:57:23.200 --> 2:57:24.040
 Sure.

2:57:24.040 --> 2:57:26.880
 I mean, we can do it very simply.

2:57:29.120 --> 2:57:33.200
 Selection might favor your engaging in war

2:57:33.200 --> 2:57:37.520
 against a defenseless enemy or genocide, right?

2:57:38.960 --> 2:57:40.160
 It's not hard to figure out

2:57:40.160 --> 2:57:43.320
 how that might put your genes at advantage.

2:57:43.320 --> 2:57:44.760
 I don't know about you, Lex.

2:57:44.760 --> 2:57:46.800
 I'm not getting involved in no genocide.

2:57:46.800 --> 2:57:47.800
 It's not gonna happen.

2:57:47.800 --> 2:57:48.640
 I won't do it.

2:57:48.640 --> 2:57:49.920
 I will do anything to avoid it.

2:57:49.920 --> 2:57:54.400
 So some part of me has decided that my conscious self

2:57:54.400 --> 2:57:59.400
 and the values that I hold trump my evolutionary self

2:57:59.400 --> 2:58:03.080
 and once you figure out that in some extreme case,

2:58:03.080 --> 2:58:04.920
 that's true and then you realize

2:58:04.920 --> 2:58:07.520
 that that means it must be possible in many other cases

2:58:07.520 --> 2:58:09.120
 and you start going through all of the things

2:58:09.120 --> 2:58:10.200
 that selection would favor

2:58:10.200 --> 2:58:12.360
 and you realize that a fair fraction of the time,

2:58:12.360 --> 2:58:14.000
 actually, you're not up for this.

2:58:14.000 --> 2:58:17.160
 You don't wanna be some robot on a mission

2:58:17.160 --> 2:58:19.960
 that involves genocide when necessary.

2:58:19.960 --> 2:58:22.000
 You wanna be your own person and accomplish things

2:58:22.000 --> 2:58:24.880
 that you think are valuable.

2:58:24.880 --> 2:58:29.880
 And so among those are not advocating,

2:58:30.880 --> 2:58:32.120
 let's suppose you were in a position

2:58:32.120 --> 2:58:35.040
 to be one of those males at the top of a polygynous system.

2:58:35.040 --> 2:58:38.160
 We both know why that would be rewarding, right?

2:58:38.160 --> 2:58:39.560
 But we also both recognize.

2:58:39.560 --> 2:58:40.400
 Do we?

2:58:40.400 --> 2:58:41.440
 Yeah, sure.

2:58:41.440 --> 2:58:42.280
 Lots of sex?

2:58:42.280 --> 2:58:43.120
 Yeah.

2:58:43.120 --> 2:58:43.960
 Okay, what else?

2:58:43.960 --> 2:58:45.960
 Lots of sex and lots of variety, right?

2:58:45.960 --> 2:58:50.960
 So look, every red blooded American slash Russian male

2:58:51.560 --> 2:58:53.840
 can understand why that's appealing, right?

2:58:53.840 --> 2:58:57.800
 On the other hand, it is up against an alternative

2:58:57.800 --> 2:59:02.360
 which is having a partner with whom one is bonded

2:59:03.320 --> 2:59:05.400
 especially closely, right?

2:59:05.400 --> 2:59:06.240
 Right.

2:59:06.240 --> 2:59:07.080
 And so.

2:59:07.080 --> 2:59:08.240
 A love.

2:59:08.240 --> 2:59:09.080
 Right.

2:59:09.080 --> 2:59:14.080
 Well, I don't wanna straw man the polygyny position.

2:59:14.080 --> 2:59:15.840
 Obviously polygyny is complex

2:59:15.840 --> 2:59:19.480
 and there's nothing that stops a man presumably

2:59:19.480 --> 2:59:23.520
 from loving multiple partners and from them loving him back.

2:59:23.520 --> 2:59:25.640
 But in terms of, if love is your thing,

2:59:25.640 --> 2:59:28.680
 there's a question about, okay, what is the quality of love

2:59:28.680 --> 2:59:31.760
 if it is divided over multiple partners, right?

2:59:31.760 --> 2:59:36.200
 And what is the net consequence for love in a society

2:59:36.200 --> 2:59:38.720
 when multiple people will be frozen out

2:59:38.720 --> 2:59:41.880
 for every individual male in this case who has it?

2:59:41.880 --> 2:59:46.040
 And what I would argue is, and you know,

2:59:46.040 --> 2:59:47.920
 this is weird to even talk about,

2:59:47.920 --> 2:59:49.680
 but this is partially me just talking

2:59:49.680 --> 2:59:51.120
 from personal experience.

2:59:51.120 --> 2:59:54.040
 I think there actually is a monogamy program in us

2:59:54.040 --> 2:59:55.640
 and it's not automatic.

2:59:55.640 --> 3:00:00.640
 But if you take it seriously, you can find it

3:00:00.680 --> 3:00:04.560
 and frankly, marriage, and it doesn't have to be marriage,

3:00:04.560 --> 3:00:07.440
 but whatever it is that results in a lifelong bond

3:00:07.440 --> 3:00:10.440
 with a partner has gotten a very bad rap.

3:00:10.440 --> 3:00:12.680
 You know, it's the butt of too many jokes.

3:00:12.680 --> 3:00:17.680
 But the truth is, it's hugely rewarding, it's not easy.

3:00:18.040 --> 3:00:20.800
 But if you know that you're looking for something, right?

3:00:20.800 --> 3:00:22.520
 If you know that the objective actually exists

3:00:22.520 --> 3:00:25.360
 and it's not some utopian fantasy that can't be found,

3:00:25.360 --> 3:00:28.600
 if you know that there's some real world, you know,

3:00:28.600 --> 3:00:32.120
 warts and all version of it, then you might actually think,

3:00:32.120 --> 3:00:34.240
 hey, that is something I want and you might pursue it

3:00:34.240 --> 3:00:36.360
 and my guess is you'd be very happy when you find it.

3:00:36.360 --> 3:00:39.440
 Yeah, I think there is, getting to the fundamental

3:00:39.440 --> 3:00:43.240
 and the emergent, I feel like there is some kind of physics

3:00:43.240 --> 3:00:44.080
 of love.

3:00:44.080 --> 3:00:47.200
 So one, there's a conservation thing going on.

3:00:47.200 --> 3:00:51.560
 So if you have like many partners, yeah, in theory,

3:00:51.560 --> 3:00:54.160
 you should be able to love all of them deeply.

3:00:54.160 --> 3:00:56.800
 But it seems like in reality that love gets split.

3:00:57.800 --> 3:00:58.880
 Yep.

3:00:58.880 --> 3:01:01.080
 Now, there's another law that's interesting

3:01:01.080 --> 3:01:02.720
 in terms of monogamy.

3:01:02.720 --> 3:01:04.600
 I don't know if it's at the physics level,

3:01:04.600 --> 3:01:09.600
 but if you are in a monogamous relationship by choice

3:01:10.280 --> 3:01:15.280
 and almost as in slight rebellion to social norms,

3:01:16.520 --> 3:01:17.760
 that's much more powerful.

3:01:17.760 --> 3:01:20.920
 Like if you choose that one partnership,

3:01:20.920 --> 3:01:22.680
 that's also more powerful.

3:01:22.680 --> 3:01:24.880
 If like everybody's in a monogamous,

3:01:24.880 --> 3:01:27.880
 this pressure to be married and this pressure of society,

3:01:27.880 --> 3:01:30.760
 that's different because that's almost like a constraint

3:01:30.760 --> 3:01:33.960
 on your freedom that is enforced by something

3:01:33.960 --> 3:01:35.440
 other than your own ideals.

3:01:35.440 --> 3:01:37.760
 It's by somebody else.

3:01:37.760 --> 3:01:40.600
 When you yourself choose to, I guess,

3:01:40.600 --> 3:01:45.000
 create these constraints, that enriches that love.

3:01:45.000 --> 3:01:47.560
 So there's some kind of love function,

3:01:47.560 --> 3:01:50.160
 like E equals MC squared, but for love,

3:01:50.160 --> 3:01:53.240
 that I feel like if you have less partners

3:01:53.240 --> 3:01:56.520
 and it's done by choice, that can maximize that.

3:01:56.520 --> 3:02:00.880
 And that love can transcend the biology,

3:02:00.880 --> 3:02:03.520
 transcend the evolutionary biology forces

3:02:03.520 --> 3:02:06.280
 that have to do much more with survival

3:02:06.280 --> 3:02:07.760
 and all those kinds of things.

3:02:07.760 --> 3:02:11.880
 It can transcend to take us to a richer experience,

3:02:11.880 --> 3:02:13.320
 which we have the luxury of having,

3:02:13.320 --> 3:02:17.960
 exploring of happiness, of joy, of fulfillment,

3:02:17.960 --> 3:02:19.400
 all those kinds of things.

3:02:19.400 --> 3:02:21.040
 Totally agree with this.

3:02:21.040 --> 3:02:24.800
 And there's no question that by choice,

3:02:24.800 --> 3:02:26.760
 when there are other choices,

3:02:26.760 --> 3:02:30.760
 imbues it with meaning that it might not otherwise have.

3:02:30.760 --> 3:02:35.640
 I would also say, I'm really struck by,

3:02:35.640 --> 3:02:40.120
 and I have a hard time not feeling terrible sadness

3:02:40.120 --> 3:02:44.360
 over what younger people are coming

3:02:44.360 --> 3:02:46.880
 to think about this topic.

3:02:46.880 --> 3:02:49.520
 I think they're missing something so important

3:02:49.520 --> 3:02:51.680
 and so hard to phrase that,

3:02:51.680 --> 3:02:54.280
 and they don't even know that they're missing it.

3:02:54.280 --> 3:02:55.960
 They might know that they're unhappy,

3:02:55.960 --> 3:02:58.000
 but they don't understand what it is

3:02:58.000 --> 3:02:58.840
 they're even looking for,

3:02:58.840 --> 3:03:00.800
 because nobody's really been honest with them

3:03:00.800 --> 3:03:02.160
 about what their choices are.

3:03:02.160 --> 3:03:05.200
 And I have to say, if I was a young person,

3:03:05.200 --> 3:03:06.960
 or if I was advising a young person,

3:03:06.960 --> 3:03:09.160
 which I used to do, again, a million years ago

3:03:09.160 --> 3:03:12.000
 when I was a college professor four years ago,

3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:13.800
 but I used to talk to students.

3:03:13.800 --> 3:03:15.000
 I knew my students really well,

3:03:15.000 --> 3:03:16.680
 and they would ask questions about this,

3:03:16.680 --> 3:03:17.600
 and they were always curious

3:03:17.600 --> 3:03:19.920
 because Heather and I seemed to have a good relationship,

3:03:19.920 --> 3:03:22.000
 and many of them knew both of us.

3:03:22.000 --> 3:03:24.480
 So they would talk to us about this.

3:03:24.480 --> 3:03:28.040
 If I was advising somebody, I would say,

3:03:28.040 --> 3:03:30.920
 do not bypass the possibility

3:03:30.920 --> 3:03:35.920
 that what you are supposed to do is find somebody worthy,

3:03:36.240 --> 3:03:37.840
 somebody who can handle it,

3:03:37.840 --> 3:03:39.520
 somebody who you are compatible with,

3:03:39.520 --> 3:03:41.840
 and that you don't have to be perfectly compatible.

3:03:41.840 --> 3:03:44.880
 It's not about dating until you find the one.

3:03:44.880 --> 3:03:48.600
 It's about finding somebody whose underlying values

3:03:48.600 --> 3:03:51.200
 and viewpoint are complimentary to yours,

3:03:51.200 --> 3:03:53.880
 sufficient that you fall in love.

3:03:53.880 --> 3:03:58.480
 If you find that person, opt out together.

3:03:58.480 --> 3:04:00.400
 Get out of this damn system

3:04:00.400 --> 3:04:02.120
 that's telling you what's sophisticated

3:04:02.120 --> 3:04:04.600
 to think about love and romance and sex.

3:04:04.600 --> 3:04:06.520
 Ignore it together, all right?

3:04:06.520 --> 3:04:11.080
 That's the key, and I believe you'll end up laughing

3:04:11.080 --> 3:04:12.160
 in the end if you do it.

3:04:12.160 --> 3:04:16.000
 You'll discover, wow, that's a hellscape

3:04:16.000 --> 3:04:19.840
 that I opted out of, and this thing I opted into?

3:04:19.840 --> 3:04:22.640
 Complicated, difficult, worth it.

3:04:22.640 --> 3:04:25.760
 Nothing that's worth it is ever not difficult,

3:04:25.760 --> 3:04:27.480
 so we should even just skip

3:04:27.480 --> 3:04:30.120
 the whole statement about difficult.

3:04:30.120 --> 3:04:30.960
 Yeah, all right.

3:04:30.960 --> 3:04:32.240
 I just, I wanna be honest.

3:04:32.240 --> 3:04:35.080
 It's not like, oh, it's nonstop joy.

3:04:35.080 --> 3:04:38.920
 No, it's fricking complex, but worth it?

3:04:38.920 --> 3:04:41.040
 No question in my mind.

3:04:41.040 --> 3:04:42.920
 Is there advice outside of love

3:04:42.920 --> 3:04:45.320
 that you can give to young people?

3:04:45.320 --> 3:04:47.920
 You were a million years ago a professor.

3:04:49.480 --> 3:04:51.480
 Is there advice you can give to young people,

3:04:51.480 --> 3:04:56.480
 high schoolers, college students about career, about life?

3:04:56.720 --> 3:04:58.800
 Yeah, but it's not, they're not gonna like it

3:04:58.800 --> 3:05:00.840
 because it's not easy to operationalize,

3:05:00.840 --> 3:05:03.080
 and this was a problem when I was a college professor, too.

3:05:03.080 --> 3:05:04.720
 People would ask me what they should do.

3:05:04.720 --> 3:05:06.280
 Should they go to graduate school?

3:05:06.280 --> 3:05:08.280
 I had almost nothing useful to say

3:05:08.280 --> 3:05:13.280
 because the job market and the market of prejob training

3:05:14.200 --> 3:05:19.120
 and all of that, these things are all so distorted

3:05:19.120 --> 3:05:23.440
 and corrupt that I didn't wanna point anybody to anything

3:05:23.440 --> 3:05:26.560
 because it's all broken, and I would tell them that,

3:05:26.560 --> 3:05:31.320
 but I would say that results in a kind of meta level advice

3:05:31.320 --> 3:05:33.400
 that I do think is useful.

3:05:33.400 --> 3:05:34.880
 You don't know what's coming.

3:05:35.840 --> 3:05:38.680
 You don't know where the opportunities will be.

3:05:38.680 --> 3:05:41.640
 You should invest in tools rather than knowledge.

3:05:42.560 --> 3:05:44.440
 To the extent that you can do things,

3:05:44.440 --> 3:05:47.880
 you can repurpose that no matter what the future brings

3:05:47.880 --> 3:05:51.880
 to the extent that if you, as a robot guy,

3:05:51.880 --> 3:05:53.840
 you've got the skills of a robot guy.

3:05:53.840 --> 3:05:56.760
 Now, if civilization failed

3:05:56.760 --> 3:05:59.580
 and the stuff of robot building disappeared with it,

3:06:00.480 --> 3:06:02.560
 you'd still have the mind of a robot guy,

3:06:02.560 --> 3:06:04.480
 and the mind of a robot guy can retool

3:06:04.480 --> 3:06:08.160
 around all kinds of things, whether you're forced to work

3:06:08.160 --> 3:06:12.640
 with fibers that are made into ropes.

3:06:12.640 --> 3:06:15.880
 Your mechanical mind would be useful in all kinds of places,

3:06:15.880 --> 3:06:19.240
 so invest in tools like that that can be easily repurposed,

3:06:19.240 --> 3:06:23.800
 and invest in combinations of tools, right?

3:06:23.800 --> 3:06:27.800
 If civilization keeps limping along,

3:06:28.960 --> 3:06:30.840
 you're gonna be up against all sorts of people

3:06:30.840 --> 3:06:33.360
 who have studied the things that you studied, right?

3:06:33.360 --> 3:06:34.840
 If you think, hey, computer programming

3:06:34.840 --> 3:06:37.720
 is really, really cool, and you pick up computer programming,

3:06:37.720 --> 3:06:40.660
 guess what, you just entered a large group of people

3:06:40.660 --> 3:06:42.540
 who have that skill, and many of them will be better

3:06:42.540 --> 3:06:44.800
 than you, almost certainly.

3:06:44.800 --> 3:06:48.600
 On the other hand, if you combine that with something else

3:06:48.600 --> 3:06:50.800
 that's very rarely combined with it,

3:06:50.800 --> 3:06:54.080
 if you have, I don't know if it's carpentry

3:06:54.080 --> 3:06:57.120
 and computer programming, if you take combinations

3:06:57.120 --> 3:07:00.560
 of things that are, even if they're both common,

3:07:00.560 --> 3:07:03.040
 but they're not commonly found together,

3:07:03.040 --> 3:07:06.080
 then those combinations create a rarefied space

3:07:06.080 --> 3:07:08.360
 where you inhabit it, and even if the things

3:07:08.360 --> 3:07:11.080
 don't even really touch, but nonetheless,

3:07:11.080 --> 3:07:13.760
 they create a mind in which the two things are live

3:07:13.760 --> 3:07:15.920
 and you can move back and forth between them

3:07:15.920 --> 3:07:18.360
 and step out of your own perspective

3:07:18.360 --> 3:07:20.400
 by moving from one to the other,

3:07:20.400 --> 3:07:22.640
 that will increase what you can see

3:07:22.640 --> 3:07:24.480
 and the quality of your tools.

3:07:24.480 --> 3:07:26.440
 And so anyway, that isn't useful advice.

3:07:26.440 --> 3:07:27.520
 It doesn't tell you whether you should go

3:07:27.520 --> 3:07:30.840
 to graduate school or not, but it does tell you

3:07:30.840 --> 3:07:33.600
 the one thing we can say for certain about the future

3:07:33.600 --> 3:07:36.080
 is that it's uncertain, and so prepare for it.

3:07:36.080 --> 3:07:38.800
 And like you said, there's cool things to be discovered

3:07:38.800 --> 3:07:42.400
 in the intersection of fields and ideas.

3:07:42.400 --> 3:07:44.960
 And I would look at grad school that way,

3:07:44.960 --> 3:07:49.960
 actually, if you do go, or I see,

3:07:50.080 --> 3:07:52.720
 I mean, this is such a, like every course

3:07:52.720 --> 3:07:55.160
 in grad school, undergrad too,

3:07:55.160 --> 3:07:57.800
 was like this little journey that you're on

3:07:57.800 --> 3:08:00.040
 that explores a particular field.

3:08:00.040 --> 3:08:03.760
 And it's not immediately obvious how useful it is,

3:08:03.760 --> 3:08:08.360
 but it allows you to discover intersections

3:08:08.360 --> 3:08:11.120
 between that thing and some other thing.

3:08:11.120 --> 3:08:16.120
 So you're bringing to the table these pieces of knowledge,

3:08:16.400 --> 3:08:19.880
 some of which when intersected might create a niche

3:08:19.880 --> 3:08:23.560
 that's completely novel, unique, and will bring you joy.

3:08:23.560 --> 3:08:25.760
 I mean, I took a huge number of courses

3:08:25.760 --> 3:08:28.040
 in theoretical computer science.

3:08:28.040 --> 3:08:31.000
 Most of them seem useless, but they totally changed

3:08:31.000 --> 3:08:34.760
 the way I see the world in ways that I'm not prepared

3:08:34.760 --> 3:08:38.640
 or is a little bit difficult to kind of make explicit,

3:08:38.640 --> 3:08:43.640
 but taken together, they've allowed me to see,

3:08:44.880 --> 3:08:48.200
 for example, the world of robotics totally different

3:08:48.200 --> 3:08:50.400
 and different from many of my colleagues

3:08:50.400 --> 3:08:51.920
 and friends and so on.

3:08:51.920 --> 3:08:54.600
 And I think that's a good way to see if you go

3:08:54.600 --> 3:08:59.160
 to grad school was as a opportunity

3:08:59.160 --> 3:09:01.920
 to explore intersections of fields,

3:09:01.920 --> 3:09:04.720
 even if the individual fields seem useless.

3:09:04.720 --> 3:09:07.120
 Yeah, and useless doesn't mean useless, right?

3:09:07.120 --> 3:09:09.280
 Useless means not directly applicable,

3:09:09.280 --> 3:09:12.160
 but a good, useless course can be the best one

3:09:12.160 --> 3:09:13.000
 you ever took.

3:09:14.200 --> 3:09:18.080
 Yeah, I took James Joyce, a course on James Joyce,

3:09:18.080 --> 3:09:20.320
 and that was truly useless.

3:09:21.240 --> 3:09:25.880
 Well, I took immunobiology in the medical school

3:09:25.880 --> 3:09:29.640
 when I was at Penn as, I guess I would have been

3:09:29.640 --> 3:09:30.880
 a freshman or a sophomore.

3:09:30.880 --> 3:09:33.040
 I wasn't supposed to be in this class.

3:09:33.040 --> 3:09:37.080
 It blew my goddamn mind, and it still does, right?

3:09:37.080 --> 3:09:39.600
 I mean, we had this, I don't even know who it was,

3:09:39.600 --> 3:09:42.720
 but we had this great professor who was highly placed

3:09:42.720 --> 3:09:44.320
 in the world of immunobiology.

3:09:44.320 --> 3:09:47.640
 The course is called Immunobiology, not immunology.

3:09:47.640 --> 3:09:50.160
 Immunobiology, it had the right focus,

3:09:50.160 --> 3:09:54.560
 and as I recall it, the professor stood sideways

3:09:54.560 --> 3:09:57.240
 to the chalkboard, staring off into space,

3:09:57.240 --> 3:10:01.240
 literally stroking his beard with this bemused look

3:10:01.240 --> 3:10:04.280
 on his face through the entire lecture.

3:10:04.280 --> 3:10:05.800
 And you had all these medical students

3:10:05.800 --> 3:10:07.200
 who were so furiously writing notes

3:10:07.200 --> 3:10:08.600
 that I don't even think they were noticing

3:10:08.600 --> 3:10:09.920
 the person delivering this thing,

3:10:09.920 --> 3:10:13.640
 but I got what this guy was smiling about.

3:10:13.640 --> 3:10:16.040
 It was like so, what he was describing,

3:10:16.040 --> 3:10:18.720
 adaptive immunity is so marvelous, right?

3:10:18.720 --> 3:10:21.420
 That it was like almost a privilege to even be saying it

3:10:21.420 --> 3:10:23.960
 to a room full of people who were listening, you know?

3:10:23.960 --> 3:10:25.360
 But anyway, yeah, I took that course,

3:10:25.360 --> 3:10:27.360
 and lo and behold, COVID.

3:10:27.360 --> 3:10:28.920
 That's gonna be useful.

3:10:28.920 --> 3:10:32.160
 Well, yeah, suddenly it's front and center,

3:10:32.160 --> 3:10:33.640
 and wow, am I glad I took it.

3:10:33.640 --> 3:10:37.080
 But anyway, yeah, useless courses are great.

3:10:37.080 --> 3:10:40.240
 And actually, Eric gave me one of the greater pieces

3:10:40.240 --> 3:10:43.420
 of advice, at least for college, that anyone's ever given,

3:10:43.420 --> 3:10:46.160
 which was don't worry about the prereqs.

3:10:46.160 --> 3:10:47.640
 Take it anyway, right?

3:10:48.560 --> 3:10:50.440
 But now, I don't even know if kids can do this now

3:10:50.440 --> 3:10:53.280
 because the prereqs are now enforced by a computer.

3:10:53.280 --> 3:10:56.800
 But back in the day, if you didn't mention

3:10:56.800 --> 3:10:58.020
 that you didn't have the prereqs,

3:10:58.020 --> 3:10:59.720
 nobody stopped you from taking the course.

3:10:59.720 --> 3:11:01.440
 And what he told me, which I didn't know,

3:11:01.440 --> 3:11:06.360
 was that often the advanced courses are easier in some way.

3:11:06.360 --> 3:11:11.360
 The material's complex, but it's not like intro bio

3:11:11.880 --> 3:11:14.480
 where you're learning a thousand things at once, right?

3:11:14.480 --> 3:11:16.040
 It's like focused on something.

3:11:16.040 --> 3:11:18.800
 So if you dedicate yourself, you can pull it off.

3:11:18.800 --> 3:11:21.520
 Yeah, stay with an idea for many weeks at a time,

3:11:21.520 --> 3:11:22.880
 and it's ultimately rewarding,

3:11:22.880 --> 3:11:24.600
 and not as difficult as it looks.

3:11:25.760 --> 3:11:27.280
 Can I ask you a ridiculous question?

3:11:27.280 --> 3:11:28.100
 Please.

3:11:28.100 --> 3:11:31.520
 What do you think is the meaning of life?

3:11:34.180 --> 3:11:38.860
 Well, I feel terrible having to give you the answer.

3:11:38.860 --> 3:11:40.260
 I realize you asked the question,

3:11:40.260 --> 3:11:43.260
 but if I tell you, you're gonna again feel bad.

3:11:43.260 --> 3:11:44.100
 I don't wanna do that.

3:11:44.100 --> 3:11:46.060
 But look, there's two.

3:11:46.060 --> 3:11:47.300
 There can be a disappointment.

3:11:47.300 --> 3:11:50.340
 No, it's gonna be a horror, right?

3:11:50.340 --> 3:11:52.660
 Because we actually know the answer to the question.

3:11:52.660 --> 3:11:53.820
 Oh no.

3:11:53.820 --> 3:11:56.180
 It's completely meaningless.

3:11:56.180 --> 3:11:58.460
 There is nothing that we can do

3:11:58.460 --> 3:12:00.780
 that escapes the heat death of the universe

3:12:00.780 --> 3:12:02.740
 or whatever it is that happens at the end.

3:12:02.740 --> 3:12:04.780
 And we're not gonna make it there anyway.

3:12:04.780 --> 3:12:07.700
 But even if you were optimistic about our ability

3:12:07.700 --> 3:12:12.700
 to escape every existential hazard indefinitely,

3:12:13.300 --> 3:12:15.900
 ultimately it's all for naught and we know it, right?

3:12:17.060 --> 3:12:20.660
 That said, once you stare into that abyss,

3:12:20.660 --> 3:12:24.420
 and then it stares back and laughs or whatever happens,

3:12:24.420 --> 3:12:27.140
 then the question is, okay, given that,

3:12:27.140 --> 3:12:29.740
 can I relax a little bit, right?

3:12:29.740 --> 3:12:31.880
 And figure out, well, what would make sense

3:12:31.880 --> 3:12:34.380
 if that were true, right?

3:12:34.380 --> 3:12:37.220
 And I think there's something very clear to me.

3:12:37.220 --> 3:12:38.980
 I think if you do all of the,

3:12:38.980 --> 3:12:41.780
 if I just take the values that I'm sure we share

3:12:41.780 --> 3:12:43.900
 and extrapolate from them,

3:12:43.900 --> 3:12:46.900
 I think the following thing is actually a moral imperative.

3:12:48.460 --> 3:12:51.600
 Being a human and having opportunity

3:12:51.600 --> 3:12:54.340
 is absolutely fucking awesome, right?

3:12:54.340 --> 3:12:56.020
 A lot of people don't make use of the opportunity

3:12:56.020 --> 3:12:58.040
 and a lot of people don't have opportunity, right?

3:12:58.040 --> 3:13:00.140
 They get to be human, but they're too constrained

3:13:00.140 --> 3:13:03.880
 by keeping a roof over their heads to really be free.

3:13:03.880 --> 3:13:07.460
 But being a free human is fantastic.

3:13:07.460 --> 3:13:10.100
 And being a free human on this beautiful planet,

3:13:10.100 --> 3:13:13.860
 crippled as it may be, is unparalleled.

3:13:13.860 --> 3:13:15.300
 I mean, what could be better?

3:13:15.300 --> 3:13:17.820
 How lucky are we that we get that, right?

3:13:17.820 --> 3:13:21.380
 So if that's true, that it is awesome to be human

3:13:21.380 --> 3:13:25.300
 and to be free, then surely it is our obligation

3:13:25.300 --> 3:13:28.220
 to deliver that opportunity to as many people as we can.

3:13:29.060 --> 3:13:30.760
 And how do you do that?

3:13:30.760 --> 3:13:33.340
 Well, I think I know what job one is.

3:13:33.340 --> 3:13:36.820
 Job one is we have to get sustainable.

3:13:36.820 --> 3:13:39.060
 The way to get the maximum number of humans

3:13:39.060 --> 3:13:42.720
 to have that opportunity to be both here and free

3:13:42.720 --> 3:13:44.900
 is to make sure that there isn't a limit

3:13:44.900 --> 3:13:46.780
 on how long we can keep doing this.

3:13:46.780 --> 3:13:50.400
 That effectively requires us to reach sustainability.

3:13:50.400 --> 3:13:54.340
 And then at sustainability, you could have a horror show

3:13:54.340 --> 3:13:55.500
 of sustainability, right?

3:13:55.500 --> 3:13:58.860
 You could have a totalitarian sustainability.

3:13:58.860 --> 3:14:00.220
 That's not the objective.

3:14:00.220 --> 3:14:02.140
 The objective is to liberate people.

3:14:02.140 --> 3:14:04.980
 And so the question, the whole fourth frontier question,

3:14:04.980 --> 3:14:08.380
 frankly, is how do you get to a sustainable

3:14:08.380 --> 3:14:10.780
 and indefinitely sustainable state

3:14:10.780 --> 3:14:13.060
 in which people feel liberated,

3:14:13.060 --> 3:14:14.500
 in which they are liberated,

3:14:14.500 --> 3:14:16.300
 to pursue the things that actually matter,

3:14:16.300 --> 3:14:21.300
 to pursue beauty, truth, compassion, connection,

3:14:22.940 --> 3:14:27.220
 all of those things that we could list as unalloyed goods,

3:14:27.220 --> 3:14:29.420
 those are the things that people should be most liberated

3:14:29.420 --> 3:14:31.660
 to do in a system that really functions.

3:14:31.660 --> 3:14:33.880
 And anyway, my point is,

3:14:35.020 --> 3:14:37.020
 I don't know how precise that calculation is,

3:14:37.020 --> 3:14:38.580
 but I'm pretty sure it's not wrong.

3:14:38.580 --> 3:14:39.940
 It's accurate enough.

3:14:39.940 --> 3:14:43.460
 And if it is accurate enough, then the point is, okay,

3:14:43.460 --> 3:14:45.300
 well, there's no ultimate meaning,

3:14:45.300 --> 3:14:47.100
 but the proximate meaning is that one.

3:14:47.100 --> 3:14:50.160
 How many people can we get to have this wonderful experience

3:14:50.160 --> 3:14:52.220
 that we've gotten to have, right?

3:14:52.220 --> 3:14:54.760
 And there's no way that's so wrong

3:14:54.760 --> 3:14:56.640
 that if I invest my life in it,

3:14:56.640 --> 3:14:58.260
 that I'm making some big error.

3:14:58.260 --> 3:14:59.180
 I'm sure of that.

3:14:59.180 --> 3:15:02.300
 Life is awesome, and we wanna spread the awesome

3:15:02.300 --> 3:15:03.520
 as much as possible.

3:15:03.520 --> 3:15:05.740
 Yeah, you sum it up that way, spread the awesome.

3:15:05.740 --> 3:15:06.680
 Spread the awesome.

3:15:06.680 --> 3:15:07.940
 So that's the fourth frontier.

3:15:07.940 --> 3:15:10.560
 And if that fails, if the fourth frontier fails,

3:15:10.560 --> 3:15:12.980
 the fifth frontier will be defined by robots,

3:15:12.980 --> 3:15:15.420
 and hopefully they'll learn the lessons

3:15:15.420 --> 3:15:18.380
 of the mistakes that the humans made

3:15:18.380 --> 3:15:20.380
 and build a better world with more awesome.

3:15:20.380 --> 3:15:21.220
 I hope they're very happy here

3:15:21.220 --> 3:15:23.540
 and that they do a better job with the place than we did.

3:15:23.540 --> 3:15:24.380
 Yeah.

3:15:25.220 --> 3:15:26.060
 Brett.

3:15:26.060 --> 3:15:29.020
 I can't believe it took us this long to talk,

3:15:29.020 --> 3:15:31.620
 as I mentioned to you before,

3:15:31.620 --> 3:15:35.780
 that we haven't actually spoken, I think, at all.

3:15:35.780 --> 3:15:39.320
 And I've always felt that we're already friends.

3:15:39.320 --> 3:15:40.700
 I don't know how that works

3:15:40.700 --> 3:15:42.940
 because I've listened to your podcasts a lot.

3:15:42.940 --> 3:15:46.060
 I've also sort of loved your brother.

3:15:46.060 --> 3:15:48.140
 And so it was like,

3:15:48.140 --> 3:15:49.940
 we've known each other for the longest time,

3:15:49.940 --> 3:15:53.940
 and I hope we can be friends and talk often again.

3:15:53.940 --> 3:15:56.260
 And I hope that you get a chance to meet

3:15:56.260 --> 3:15:59.020
 some of my robot friends as well and fall in love.

3:15:59.020 --> 3:16:02.620
 And I'm so glad that you love robots as well.

3:16:02.620 --> 3:16:04.060
 So we get to share in that love.

3:16:04.060 --> 3:16:07.620
 So I can't wait for us to interact together.

3:16:07.620 --> 3:16:11.680
 So we went from talking about some of the worst failures

3:16:11.680 --> 3:16:14.620
 of humanity to some of the most beautiful

3:16:14.620 --> 3:16:16.380
 aspects of humanity.

3:16:16.380 --> 3:16:18.840
 What else can you ask for from a conversation?

3:16:18.840 --> 3:16:20.580
 Thank you so much for talking today.

3:16:20.580 --> 3:16:23.140
 You know, Lex, I feel the same way towards you,

3:16:23.140 --> 3:16:24.280
 and I really appreciate it.

3:16:24.280 --> 3:16:25.260
 This has been a lot of fun,

3:16:25.260 --> 3:16:27.860
 and I'm looking forward to our next one.

3:16:27.860 --> 3:16:29.260
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

3:16:29.260 --> 3:16:30.340
 with Brett Weinstein,

3:16:30.340 --> 3:16:32.820
 and thank you to Jordan Harbridge's show,

3:16:32.820 --> 3:16:36.500
 Express CPN, Magic Spoon, and Four Sigmatic.

3:16:36.500 --> 3:16:39.820
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

3:16:39.820 --> 3:16:41.820
 And now, let me leave you with some words

3:16:41.820 --> 3:16:43.680
 from Charles Darwin.

3:16:43.680 --> 3:16:46.540
 Ignorance more frequently begets confidence

3:16:46.540 --> 3:16:47.880
 than does knowledge.

3:16:47.880 --> 3:16:51.540
 It is those who know little, not those who know much,

3:16:51.540 --> 3:16:55.140
 who so positively assert that this or that problem

3:16:55.140 --> 3:16:57.720
 will never be solved by science.

3:16:57.720 --> 3:17:09.720
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
