00:00.000 --> 00:03.240
 The following is a conversation with Judea Pearl,

00:03.240 --> 00:06.720
 professor at UCLA and a winner of the Turing Award

00:06.720 --> 00:10.640
 that's generally recognized as the Nobel Prize of Computing.

00:10.640 --> 00:12.400
 He's one of the seminal figures

00:12.400 --> 00:14.440
 in the field of artificial intelligence,

00:14.440 --> 00:16.640
 computer science, and statistics.

00:16.640 --> 00:19.960
 He has developed and championed probabilistic approaches

00:19.960 --> 00:22.680
 to AI, including Beijing networks,

00:22.680 --> 00:26.040
 and profound ideas in causality in general.

00:26.040 --> 00:29.080
 These ideas are important not just to AI,

00:29.080 --> 00:32.800
 but to our understanding and practice of science.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.840
 But in the field of AI, the idea of causality,

00:35.840 --> 00:39.400
 cause and effect, to many, lie at the core

00:39.400 --> 00:42.080
 of what is currently missing and what must be developed

00:42.080 --> 00:45.060
 in order to build truly intelligent systems.

00:46.080 --> 00:48.000
 For this reason, and many others,

00:48.000 --> 00:50.760
 his work is worth returning to often.

00:50.760 --> 00:54.200
 I recommend his most recent book called Book of Why

00:54.200 --> 00:57.160
 that presents key ideas from a lifetime of work

00:57.160 --> 01:00.440
 in a way that is accessible to the general public.

01:00.440 --> 01:03.480
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.880
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

01:05.880 --> 01:07.840
 give it five stars on Apple Podcast,

01:07.840 --> 01:11.360
 support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter

01:11.360 --> 01:15.320
 at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

01:15.320 --> 01:18.200
 If you leave a review on Apple Podcasts especially,

01:18.200 --> 01:20.960
 but also a cast box or comment on YouTube,

01:20.960 --> 01:23.920
 consider mentioning topics, people, ideas, questions,

01:23.920 --> 01:26.120
 quotes, and science, tech, and philosophy

01:26.120 --> 01:29.560
 you find interesting, and I'll read them on this podcast.

01:29.560 --> 01:31.960
 I won't call out names, but I love comments

01:31.960 --> 01:33.880
 with kindness and thoughtfulness in them,

01:33.880 --> 01:35.760
 so I thought I'd share them with you.

01:35.760 --> 01:37.840
 Someone on YouTube highlighted a quote

01:37.840 --> 01:40.040
 from the conversation with Noam Chomsky,

01:40.040 --> 01:42.800
 where he said that the significance of your life

01:42.800 --> 01:44.780
 is something you create.

01:44.780 --> 01:46.600
 I like this line as well.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.880
 On most days, the existentialist approach to life

01:49.880 --> 01:53.660
 is one I find liberating and fulfilling.

01:53.660 --> 01:55.040
 I recently started doing ads

01:55.040 --> 01:56.640
 at the end of the introduction.

01:56.640 --> 01:59.400
 I'll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode,

01:59.400 --> 02:01.080
 and never any ads in the middle

02:01.080 --> 02:03.280
 that break the flow of the conversation.

02:03.280 --> 02:04.760
 I hope that works for you

02:04.760 --> 02:07.160
 and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

02:08.280 --> 02:10.600
 This show is presented by Cash App,

02:10.600 --> 02:13.040
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

02:13.040 --> 02:15.520
 I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,

02:15.520 --> 02:17.420
 but you can also use it to buy, sell,

02:17.420 --> 02:20.100
 and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.

02:20.100 --> 02:22.800
 Cash App also has a new investing feature.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.860
 You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth,

02:25.860 --> 02:28.040
 no matter what the stock price is.

02:28.040 --> 02:30.720
 Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,

02:30.720 --> 02:34.280
 a subsidiary of Square, a member of SIPC.

02:34.280 --> 02:36.600
 I'm excited to be working with Cash App

02:36.600 --> 02:39.940
 to support one of my favorite organizations called First,

02:39.940 --> 02:43.440
 best known for their first robotics and Lego competitions.

02:43.440 --> 02:47.120
 They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students

02:47.120 --> 02:49.000
 in over 110 countries,

02:49.000 --> 02:51.760
 and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,

02:51.760 --> 02:53.120
 which means the donated money

02:53.120 --> 02:56.000
 is used to the maximum effectiveness.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.680
 When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play,

02:58.680 --> 03:02.640
 and use the code LEXPODCAST, you'll get $10,

03:02.640 --> 03:05.600
 and Cash App will also donate $10 to First,

03:05.600 --> 03:07.560
 which again, is an organization

03:07.560 --> 03:10.120
 that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys

03:10.120 --> 03:12.800
 to dream of engineering a better world.

03:12.800 --> 03:16.940
 And now, here's my conversation with Judea Pearl.

03:18.080 --> 03:19.720
 You mentioned in an interview

03:19.720 --> 03:21.840
 that science is not a collection of facts,

03:21.840 --> 03:23.960
 but a constant human struggle

03:23.960 --> 03:25.560
 with the mysteries of nature.

03:26.700 --> 03:29.240
 What was the first mystery that you can recall

03:29.240 --> 03:30.800
 that hooked you, that kept you in the creaset?

03:30.800 --> 03:33.480
 Oh, the first mystery, that's a good one.

03:34.440 --> 03:36.240
 Yeah, I remember that.

03:37.840 --> 03:40.000
 I had a fever for three days.

03:41.440 --> 03:45.680
 And when I learned about Descartes, analytic geometry,

03:45.680 --> 03:49.880
 and I found out that you can do all the construction

03:49.880 --> 03:51.820
 in geometry using algebra.

03:52.880 --> 03:54.480
 And I couldn't get over it.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.360
 I simply couldn't get out of bed.

03:58.280 --> 04:01.900
 So what kind of world does analytic geometry unlock?

04:02.800 --> 04:05.580
 Well, it connects algebra with geometry.

04:07.320 --> 04:09.360
 Okay, so Descartes had the idea

04:09.360 --> 04:14.360
 that geometrical construction and geometrical theorems

04:14.360 --> 04:17.520
 and assumptions can be articulated

04:17.520 --> 04:19.520
 in the language of algebra,

04:19.520 --> 04:24.520
 which means that all the proof that we did in high school,

04:24.840 --> 04:28.560
 and trying to prove that the three bisectors

04:28.560 --> 04:32.360
 meet at one point, and that, okay,

04:33.640 --> 04:38.640
 all this can be proven by just shuffling around notation.

04:39.440 --> 04:43.560
 Yeah, that was a traumatic experience.

04:43.560 --> 04:44.400
 That was a traumatic experience.

04:44.400 --> 04:45.520
 For me, it was, I'm telling you.

04:45.520 --> 04:46.960
 So it's the connection

04:46.960 --> 04:49.120
 between the different mathematical disciplines,

04:49.120 --> 04:49.960
 that they all.

04:49.960 --> 04:52.960
 Not in between two different languages.

04:52.960 --> 04:53.800
 Languages.

04:53.800 --> 04:54.640
 Yeah.

04:54.640 --> 04:57.200
 So which mathematic discipline is most beautiful?

04:57.200 --> 04:58.560
 Is geometry it for you?

04:58.560 --> 04:59.440
 Both are beautiful.

04:59.440 --> 05:02.400
 They have almost the same power.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.920
 But there's a visual element to geometry, being a.

05:04.920 --> 05:08.080
 Visually, it's more transparent.

05:08.080 --> 05:10.680
 But once you get over to algebra,

05:10.680 --> 05:14.400
 then the linear equation is a straight line.

05:14.400 --> 05:18.160
 This translation is easily absorbed, okay?

05:18.160 --> 05:22.760
 And to pass a tangent to a circle,

05:22.760 --> 05:25.480
 you know, you have the basic theorems,

05:25.480 --> 05:27.480
 and you can do it with algebra.

05:27.480 --> 05:31.520
 So but the transition from one to another was really,

05:31.520 --> 05:34.120
 I thought that Descartes was the greatest mathematician

05:34.120 --> 05:35.160
 of all times.

05:35.160 --> 05:40.160
 So you have been at the, if you think of engineering

05:40.840 --> 05:43.240
 and mathematics as a spectrum.

05:43.240 --> 05:44.080
 Yes.

05:44.080 --> 05:49.080
 You have been, you have walked casually along this spectrum

05:49.200 --> 05:51.520
 throughout your life.

05:51.520 --> 05:53.000
 You know, a little bit of engineering,

05:53.000 --> 05:54.920
 and then, you know,

05:55.920 --> 05:58.800
 you've done a little bit of mathematics here and there.

05:58.800 --> 05:59.640
 Not a little bit.

05:59.640 --> 06:04.080
 I mean, we got a very solid background in mathematics,

06:04.080 --> 06:07.080
 because our teachers were geniuses.

06:07.080 --> 06:09.720
 Our teachers came from Germany in the 1930s,

06:09.720 --> 06:11.880
 running away from Hitler.

06:11.880 --> 06:15.080
 They left their careers in Heidelberg and Berlin,

06:15.080 --> 06:17.840
 and came to teach high school in Israel.

06:17.840 --> 06:21.600
 And we were the beneficiary of that experiment.

06:21.600 --> 06:25.200
 So I, and they taught us math the good way.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.720
 What's the good way to teach math?

06:26.720 --> 06:27.720
 Chronologically.

06:29.040 --> 06:29.880
 The people.

06:29.880 --> 06:33.320
 The people behind the theorems, yeah.

06:33.320 --> 06:37.720
 Their cousins, and their nieces, and their faces.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.520
 And how they jumped from the bathtub when they scream,

06:41.520 --> 06:42.360
 Eureka!

06:43.480 --> 06:45.160
 And ran naked in town.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.240
 So you're almost educated as a historian of math.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.920
 No, we just got a glimpse of that history

06:51.920 --> 06:53.760
 together with a theorem,

06:53.760 --> 06:58.200
 so every exercise in math was connected with a person.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.040
 And the time of the person.

07:01.040 --> 07:03.520
 The period.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.600
 The period, also mathematically speaking.

07:05.600 --> 07:06.880
 Mathematically speaking, yes.

07:06.880 --> 07:09.040
 Not the politics, no.

07:09.040 --> 07:14.000
 So, and then in university,

07:14.000 --> 07:16.240
 you have gone on to do engineering.

07:16.240 --> 07:17.200
 Yeah.

07:17.200 --> 07:20.680
 I get a B.S. in engineering and a technical, right?

07:20.680 --> 07:25.600
 And then I moved here for graduate work,

07:25.600 --> 07:30.280
 and I got, I did engineering in addition to physics

07:30.280 --> 07:35.280
 in Rutgers, and it combined very nicely with my thesis,

07:35.840 --> 07:39.280
 which I did in RCA Laboratories in superconductivity.

07:40.480 --> 07:43.760
 And then somehow thought to switch

07:43.760 --> 07:46.720
 to almost computer science, software,

07:46.720 --> 07:50.800
 even, not switch, but long to become,

07:50.800 --> 07:53.000
 to get into software engineering a little bit.

07:53.000 --> 07:53.840
 Yes.

07:53.840 --> 07:56.200
 And programming, if you can call it that in the 70s.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.120
 So there's all these disciplines.

07:58.120 --> 07:58.960
 Yeah.

07:58.960 --> 08:02.880
 So to pick a favorite, in terms of engineering

08:02.880 --> 08:07.120
 and mathematics, which path do you think has more beauty?

08:07.120 --> 08:08.600
 Which path has more power?

08:08.600 --> 08:10.560
 It's hard to choose, no.

08:10.560 --> 08:14.640
 I enjoy doing physics, and even have a vortex

08:14.640 --> 08:16.000
 named on my name.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.840
 So I have investment in immortality.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.160
 So what is a vortex?

08:25.160 --> 08:27.000
 Vortex is in superconductivity.

08:27.000 --> 08:27.840
 In the superconductivity, yeah.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.880
 You have permanent current swirling around.

08:30.880 --> 08:34.560
 One way or the other, you can have a store one or zero

08:34.560 --> 08:35.400
 for a computer.

08:35.400 --> 08:39.680
 That's what we worked on in the 1960 in RCA.

08:39.680 --> 08:44.080
 And I discovered a few nice phenomena with the vortices.

08:44.080 --> 08:44.920
 You push current and they move.

08:44.920 --> 08:46.600
 So that's a pearl vortex.

08:46.600 --> 08:50.240
 Pearl vortex, right, you can Google it, right?

08:50.240 --> 08:52.360
 I didn't know about it, but the physicists,

08:52.360 --> 08:57.200
 they picked up on my thesis, on my PhD thesis,

08:57.200 --> 09:02.200
 and it becomes popular when thin film superconductors

09:03.240 --> 09:06.920
 became important for high temperature superconductors.

09:06.920 --> 09:10.840
 So they called it pearl vortex without my knowledge.

09:10.840 --> 09:13.800
 I discovered it only about 15 years ago.

09:14.760 --> 09:17.560
 You have footprints in all of the sciences.

09:17.560 --> 09:20.960
 So let's talk about the universe a little bit.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.880
 Is the universe at the lowest level deterministic

09:23.880 --> 09:27.400
 or stochastic in your amateur philosophy view?

09:27.400 --> 09:30.120
 Put another way, does God play dice?

09:30.120 --> 09:33.000
 We know it is stochastic, right?

09:33.000 --> 09:35.160
 Today, today we think it is stochastic.

09:35.160 --> 09:36.000
 Yes.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.120
 We think because we have the Heisenberg uncertainty principle

09:40.120 --> 09:44.680
 and we have some experiments to confirm that.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.960
 All we have is experiments to confirm it.

09:47.960 --> 09:49.240
 We don't understand why.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.440
 Why is already?

09:51.440 --> 09:52.960
 You wrote a book about why.

09:52.960 --> 09:57.240
 Yeah, it's a puzzle.

09:57.240 --> 10:02.240
 It's a puzzle that you have the dice flipping machine,

10:02.400 --> 10:07.400
 oh God, and the result of the flipping

10:08.560 --> 10:12.280
 propagate with the speed faster than the speed of light.

10:12.280 --> 10:14.240
 We can't explain it, okay?

10:14.240 --> 10:19.240
 So, but it only governs microscopic phenomena.

10:19.240 --> 10:21.320
 Microscopic phenomena.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.560
 So you don't think of quantum mechanics

10:23.560 --> 10:28.240
 as useful for understanding the nature of reality?

10:28.240 --> 10:30.400
 No, diversionary.

10:30.400 --> 10:34.520
 So in your thinking, the world might

10:34.520 --> 10:36.000
 as well be deterministic.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.480
 The world is deterministic,

10:38.480 --> 10:42.800
 and as far as the neuron firing is concerned,

10:42.800 --> 10:47.240
 it is deterministic to first approximation.

10:47.240 --> 10:48.920
 What about free will?

10:48.920 --> 10:52.920
 Free will is also a nice exercise.

10:52.920 --> 10:57.920
 Free will is an illusion that we AI people are gonna solve.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.800
 So what do you think once we solve it,

11:01.800 --> 11:03.360
 that solution will look like?

11:03.360 --> 11:04.200
 Once we put it in the page.

11:04.200 --> 11:06.240
 The solution will look like,

11:06.240 --> 11:08.920
 first of all, it will look like a machine.

11:08.920 --> 11:12.560
 A machine that act as though it has free will.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.760
 It communicates with other machines

11:14.760 --> 11:17.160
 as though they have free will,

11:17.160 --> 11:19.480
 and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference

11:19.480 --> 11:21.560
 between a machine that does

11:21.560 --> 11:24.680
 and a machine that doesn't have free will, okay?

11:24.680 --> 11:26.840
 So the illusion, it propagates the illusion

11:26.840 --> 11:28.960
 of free will amongst the other machines.

11:28.960 --> 11:33.120
 And faking it is having it, okay?

11:33.120 --> 11:35.120
 That's what Turing test is all about.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.160
 Faking intelligence is intelligent

11:37.160 --> 11:41.080
 because it's not easy to fake.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.200
 It's very hard to fake,

11:43.200 --> 11:45.200
 and you can only fake if you have it.

11:45.200 --> 11:50.200
 So that's such a beautiful statement.

11:54.080 --> 11:57.960
 Yeah, you can't fake it if you don't have it, yeah.

11:59.520 --> 12:04.520
 So let's begin at the beginning with probability,

12:06.800 --> 12:09.360
 both philosophically and mathematically.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.560
 What does it mean to say the probability

12:11.560 --> 12:15.160
 of something happening is 50%?

12:15.160 --> 12:16.960
 What is probability?

12:16.960 --> 12:18.680
 It's a degree of uncertainty

12:18.680 --> 12:22.400
 that an agent has about the world.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.760
 You're still expressing some knowledge in that statement.

12:24.760 --> 12:26.000
 Of course.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.840
 If the probability is 90%,

12:27.840 --> 12:29.800
 it's absolutely a different kind of knowledge

12:29.800 --> 12:32.480
 than if it is 10%.

12:32.480 --> 12:36.080
 But it's still not solid knowledge, it's...

12:36.080 --> 12:38.520
 It is solid knowledge, but hey,

12:38.520 --> 12:43.520
 if you tell me that 90% assurance smoking

12:43.520 --> 12:48.520
 will give you lung cancer in five years versus 10%,

12:48.880 --> 12:52.400
 it's a piece of useful knowledge.

12:52.400 --> 12:56.120
 So the statistical view of the universe,

12:56.120 --> 12:57.600
 why is it useful?

12:57.600 --> 13:00.760
 So we're swimming in complete uncertainty,

13:00.760 --> 13:01.600
 most of everything around us.

13:01.600 --> 13:06.120
 It allows you to predict things with a certain probability,

13:06.120 --> 13:09.240
 and computing those probabilities are very useful.

13:09.240 --> 13:14.160
 That's the whole idea of prediction.

13:15.080 --> 13:18.160
 And you need prediction to be able to survive.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.640
 If you can't predict the future,

13:19.640 --> 13:22.320
 then you're just crossing the street,

13:22.320 --> 13:25.040
 will be extremely fearful.

13:26.080 --> 13:28.840
 And so you've done a lot of work in causation,

13:28.840 --> 13:32.120
 and so let's think about correlation.

13:32.120 --> 13:34.320
 I started with probability.

13:34.320 --> 13:35.640
 You started with probability.

13:35.640 --> 13:38.760
 You've invented the Bayesian networks.

13:38.760 --> 13:39.600
 Yeah.

13:39.600 --> 13:43.880
 And so we'll dance back and forth

13:43.880 --> 13:47.480
 between these levels of uncertainty.

13:47.480 --> 13:49.320
 But what is correlation?

13:49.320 --> 13:50.360
 What is it?

13:50.360 --> 13:54.000
 So probability of something happening is something,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.480
 but then there's a bunch of things happening.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.680
 And sometimes they happen together,

13:58.680 --> 14:00.760
 sometimes not, they're independent or not.

14:00.760 --> 14:03.640
 So how do you think about correlation of things?

14:03.640 --> 14:06.280
 Correlation occurs when two things vary together

14:06.280 --> 14:09.720
 over a very long time is one way of measuring it.

14:09.720 --> 14:11.840
 Or when you have a bunch of variables

14:11.840 --> 14:14.560
 that they all vary cohesively,

14:15.880 --> 14:18.600
 then because we have a correlation here.

14:18.600 --> 14:21.720
 And usually when we think about correlation,

14:21.720 --> 14:24.400
 we really think causally.

14:24.400 --> 14:27.960
 Things cannot be correlated unless there is a reason

14:27.960 --> 14:30.280
 for them to vary together.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.040
 Why should they vary together?

14:32.040 --> 14:35.560
 If they don't see each other, why should they vary together?

14:35.560 --> 14:38.240
 So underlying it somewhere is causation.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.240
 Yes.

14:39.240 --> 14:43.160
 Hidden in our intuition, there is a notion of causation

14:43.160 --> 14:48.160
 because we cannot grasp any other logic except causation.

14:48.600 --> 14:53.600
 And how does conditional probability differ from causation?

14:55.600 --> 14:57.920
 So what is conditional probability?

14:57.920 --> 15:00.560
 Conditional probability, how things vary

15:00.560 --> 15:05.040
 when one of them stays the same.

15:05.040 --> 15:09.320
 Now staying the same means that I have chosen

15:09.320 --> 15:11.720
 to look only at those incidents

15:11.720 --> 15:16.120
 where the guy has the same value as previous one.

15:16.120 --> 15:19.280
 It's my choice as an experimenter.

15:19.280 --> 15:22.280
 So things that are not correlated before

15:22.280 --> 15:24.240
 could become correlated.

15:24.240 --> 15:26.840
 Like for instance, if I have two coins

15:26.840 --> 15:29.240
 which are uncorrelated, okay,

15:29.240 --> 15:33.760
 and I choose only those flippings, experiments

15:33.760 --> 15:36.680
 in which a bell rings, and the bell rings

15:36.680 --> 15:40.760
 when at least one of them is a tail, okay,

15:40.760 --> 15:44.360
 then suddenly I see correlation between the two coins

15:44.360 --> 15:48.400
 because I only look at the cases where the bell rang.

15:49.280 --> 15:53.680
 You see, it's my design, with my ignorance essentially,

15:53.680 --> 15:58.680
 with my audacity to ignore certain incidents,

15:58.680 --> 16:03.680
 I suddenly create a correlation

16:04.760 --> 16:06.760
 where it doesn't exist physically.

16:07.760 --> 16:11.400
 Right, so that's, you just outlined one of the flaws

16:11.400 --> 16:14.960
 of observing the world and trying to infer something

16:14.960 --> 16:16.080
 from the math about the world

16:16.080 --> 16:17.520
 from looking at the correlation.

16:17.520 --> 16:20.960
 I don't look at it as a flaw, the world works like that.

16:20.960 --> 16:24.960
 But the flaws comes if we try to impose

16:24.960 --> 16:29.960
 causal logic on correlation, it doesn't work too well.

16:34.680 --> 16:36.320
 I mean, but that's exactly what we do.

16:36.320 --> 16:40.040
 That's what, that has been the majority of science.

16:40.040 --> 16:45.040
 The majority of naive science, the decisions know it.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.840
 The decisions know that if you condition

16:47.840 --> 16:50.960
 on a third variable, then you can destroy

16:50.960 --> 16:55.640
 or create correlations among two other variables.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.360
 They know it, it's in their data.

16:58.480 --> 17:01.120
 It's nothing surprising, that's why they all dismiss

17:01.120 --> 17:04.120
 the Simpson Paradox, ah, we know it.

17:04.120 --> 17:05.880
 They don't know anything about it.

17:07.280 --> 17:09.680
 Well, there's disciplines like psychology

17:09.680 --> 17:12.880
 where all the variables are hard to account for.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.200
 And so oftentimes there's a leap

17:15.200 --> 17:17.520
 between correlation to causation.

17:17.520 --> 17:18.840
 You're imposing.

17:18.840 --> 17:21.120
 You're implying a leap.

17:21.120 --> 17:24.440
 Who is trying to get causation from correlation?

17:26.520 --> 17:27.960
 You're not proving causation,

17:27.960 --> 17:31.680
 but you're sort of discussing it,

17:31.680 --> 17:35.360
 implying, sort of hypothesizing with our ability to prove.

17:35.360 --> 17:37.040
 Which discipline you have in mind?

17:37.040 --> 17:40.440
 I'll tell you if they are obsolete,

17:40.440 --> 17:44.240
 or if they are outdated, or they are about to get outdated.

17:44.240 --> 17:45.440
 Yes, yes.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.760
 Tell me which one you have in mind.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.160
 Oh, psychology, you know.

17:48.160 --> 17:50.760
 Psychology, what, is it SEM, structural equation?

17:50.760 --> 17:54.280
 No, no, I was thinking of applied psychology studying.

17:54.280 --> 17:57.200
 For example, we work with human behavior

17:57.200 --> 18:00.360
 in semi autonomous vehicles, how people behave.

18:00.360 --> 18:02.560
 And you have to conduct these studies

18:02.560 --> 18:03.960
 of people driving cars.

18:03.960 --> 18:05.520
 Everything starts with the question.

18:05.520 --> 18:07.800
 What is the research question?

18:07.800 --> 18:09.400
 What is the research question?

18:10.400 --> 18:14.320
 The research question, do people fall asleep

18:14.320 --> 18:18.560
 when the car is driving itself?

18:18.560 --> 18:22.240
 Do they fall asleep, or do they tend to fall asleep

18:22.240 --> 18:23.160
 more frequently?

18:23.160 --> 18:24.000
 More frequently.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.960
 Than the car not driving itself.

18:25.960 --> 18:26.880
 Not driving itself.

18:26.880 --> 18:28.720
 That's a good question, okay.

18:28.720 --> 18:32.480
 And so you measure, you put people in the car

18:32.480 --> 18:33.720
 because it's real world.

18:33.720 --> 18:35.160
 You can't conduct an experiment

18:35.160 --> 18:36.320
 where you control everything.

18:36.320 --> 18:37.840
 Why can't you control?

18:37.840 --> 18:38.680
 You could.

18:38.680 --> 18:43.680
 Why can't you control the automatic module on and off?

18:44.760 --> 18:47.720
 Because it's on road, public.

18:47.720 --> 18:52.680
 I mean, there's aspects to it that's unethical.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.920
 Because it's testing on public roads.

18:54.920 --> 18:56.640
 So you can only use vehicle.

18:56.640 --> 19:00.240
 They have to, the people, the drivers themselves

19:00.240 --> 19:02.840
 have to make that choice themselves.

19:02.840 --> 19:05.080
 And so they regulate that.

19:05.080 --> 19:09.040
 And so you just observe when they drive autonomously

19:09.040 --> 19:10.320
 and when they don't.

19:10.320 --> 19:11.160
 And then.

19:11.160 --> 19:13.120
 But maybe they turn it off when they were very tired.

19:13.120 --> 19:14.520
 Yeah, that kind of thing.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.600
 But you don't know those variables.

19:16.600 --> 19:19.360
 Okay, so that you have now uncontrolled experiment.

19:19.360 --> 19:20.680
 Uncontrolled experiment.

19:20.680 --> 19:23.200
 We call it observational study.

19:23.200 --> 19:27.160
 And we form the correlation detected.

19:27.160 --> 19:30.520
 We have to infer causal relationship.

19:30.520 --> 19:33.440
 Whether it was the automatic piece

19:33.440 --> 19:35.960
 has caused them to fall asleep, or.

19:35.960 --> 19:40.960
 So that is an issue that is about 120 years old.

19:45.440 --> 19:48.640
 I should only go 100 years old, okay.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.840
 Well, maybe it's not.

19:52.840 --> 19:55.240
 Actually I should say it's 2,000 years old.

19:55.240 --> 19:58.520
 Because we have this experiment by Daniel.

19:58.520 --> 20:03.520
 But the Babylonian king that wanted the exiled,

20:07.440 --> 20:12.440
 the people from Israel that were taken in exile

20:12.760 --> 20:14.720
 to Babylon to serve the king.

20:14.720 --> 20:18.080
 He wanted to serve them king's food, which was meat.

20:18.080 --> 20:22.760
 And Daniel as a good Jew couldn't eat non kosher food.

20:22.760 --> 20:26.640
 So he asked them to eat vegetarian food.

20:26.640 --> 20:29.320
 But the king overseer says, I'm sorry,

20:29.320 --> 20:34.320
 but if the king sees that your performance falls below

20:34.760 --> 20:39.360
 that of other kids, he's going to kill me.

20:39.360 --> 20:41.600
 Daniel said, let's make an experiment.

20:41.600 --> 20:44.320
 Let's take four of us from Jerusalem, okay.

20:44.320 --> 20:46.440
 Give us vegetarian food.

20:46.440 --> 20:50.280
 Let's take the other guys to eat the king's food.

20:50.280 --> 20:54.080
 And in about a week's time, we'll test our performance.

20:54.080 --> 20:55.440
 And you know the answer.

20:55.440 --> 20:57.840
 Of course he did the experiment.

20:57.840 --> 21:02.120
 And they were so much better than the others.

21:02.120 --> 21:07.120
 And the kings nominated them to super position in his king.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.160
 So it was a first experiment, yes.

21:10.160 --> 21:12.760
 So there was a very simple,

21:12.760 --> 21:15.520
 it's also the same research questions.

21:15.520 --> 21:17.440
 We want to know if vegetarian food

21:18.640 --> 21:23.480
 assist or obstruct your mental ability.

21:23.480 --> 21:28.480
 And okay, so the question is very old one.

21:30.440 --> 21:35.440
 Even Democritus said, if I could discover one cause

21:38.040 --> 21:41.480
 of things, I would rather discover one cause

21:41.480 --> 21:43.720
 and be a king of Persia, okay.

21:43.720 --> 21:48.720
 The task of discovering causes was in the mind

21:48.720 --> 21:53.480
 of ancient people from many, many years ago.

21:53.480 --> 21:58.360
 But the mathematics of doing that was only developed

21:58.360 --> 22:00.480
 in the 1920s.

22:00.480 --> 22:05.120
 So science has left us orphan, okay.

22:05.120 --> 22:08.320
 Science has not provided us with the mathematics

22:08.320 --> 22:12.000
 to capture the idea of X causes Y

22:12.000 --> 22:14.320
 and Y does not cause X.

22:14.320 --> 22:17.400
 Because all the question of physics are symmetrical,

22:17.400 --> 22:20.660
 algebraic, the equality sign goes both ways.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.120
 Okay, let's look at machine learning.

22:23.120 --> 22:26.880
 Machine learning today, if you look at deep neural networks,

22:26.880 --> 22:31.880
 you can think of it as kind of conditional probability

22:32.840 --> 22:33.680
 estimators.

22:33.680 --> 22:35.520
 Correct, beautiful.

22:35.520 --> 22:38.120
 So where did you say that?

22:39.280 --> 22:41.520
 Conditional probability estimators.

22:41.520 --> 22:44.440
 None of the machine learning people clevered you?

22:45.360 --> 22:46.840
 Attacked you?

22:46.840 --> 22:51.840
 Listen, most people, and this is why today's conversation

22:52.400 --> 22:55.800
 I think is interesting, is most people would agree with you.

22:55.800 --> 22:58.680
 There's certain aspects that are just effective today,

22:58.680 --> 23:02.440
 but we're going to hit a wall and there's a lot of ideas.

23:02.440 --> 23:05.400
 I think you're very right that we're gonna have to return to

23:05.400 --> 23:10.400
 about causality and it would be, let's try to explore it.

23:11.560 --> 23:13.160
 Let's even take a step back.

23:13.160 --> 23:18.160
 You've invented Bayesian networks that look awfully a lot

23:19.800 --> 23:22.040
 like they express something like causation,

23:22.040 --> 23:24.020
 but they don't, not necessarily.

23:25.280 --> 23:28.600
 So how do we turn Bayesian networks

23:28.600 --> 23:30.840
 into expressing causation?

23:30.840 --> 23:33.160
 How do we build causal networks?

23:33.160 --> 23:36.480
 This A causes B, B causes C,

23:36.480 --> 23:38.840
 how do we start to infer that kind of thing?

23:38.840 --> 23:41.460
 We start asking ourselves question,

23:41.460 --> 23:44.520
 what are the factors that would determine

23:44.520 --> 23:46.360
 the value of X?

23:46.360 --> 23:51.360
 X could be blood pressure, death, hunger.

23:53.820 --> 23:56.240
 But these are hypotheses that we propose for ourselves.

23:56.240 --> 23:59.040
 Hypothesis, everything which has to do with causality

23:59.040 --> 24:00.780
 comes from a theory.

24:03.400 --> 24:06.960
 The difference is only how you interrogate

24:06.960 --> 24:09.080
 the theory that you have in your mind.

24:09.080 --> 24:14.080
 So it still needs the human expert to propose.

24:14.280 --> 24:19.280
 You need the human expert to specify the initial model.

24:20.980 --> 24:24.040
 Initial model could be very qualitative.

24:24.040 --> 24:27.040
 Just who listens to whom?

24:27.040 --> 24:31.240
 By whom listen to, I mean one variable listen to the other.

24:31.240 --> 24:34.720
 So I say, okay, the tide is listening to the moon.

24:34.720 --> 24:39.720
 And not to the rooster crow.

24:42.280 --> 24:43.120
 And so forth.

24:43.120 --> 24:46.840
 This is our understanding of the world in which we live.

24:46.840 --> 24:50.340
 Scientific understanding of reality.

24:51.540 --> 24:53.480
 We have to start there.

24:53.480 --> 24:56.960
 Because if we don't know how to handle

24:56.960 --> 24:58.560
 cause and effect relationship,

24:58.560 --> 25:01.240
 when we do have a model,

25:01.240 --> 25:03.720
 and we certainly do not know how to handle it

25:03.720 --> 25:05.400
 when we don't have a model.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.240
 So let's start first.

25:07.240 --> 25:12.160
 In AI, slogan is representation first, discovery second.

25:13.440 --> 25:17.240
 But if I give you all the information that you need,

25:17.240 --> 25:19.840
 can you do anything useful with it?

25:19.840 --> 25:21.520
 That is the first, representation.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.520
 How do you represent it?

25:22.520 --> 25:24.560
 I give you all the knowledge in the world.

25:24.560 --> 25:25.760
 How do you represent it?

25:26.920 --> 25:30.680
 When you represent it, I ask you,

25:30.680 --> 25:33.200
 can you infer X or Y or Z?

25:33.200 --> 25:35.240
 Can you answer certain queries?

25:35.240 --> 25:36.920
 Is it complex?

25:36.920 --> 25:37.840
 Is it polynomial?

25:39.280 --> 25:42.040
 All the computer science exercises we do,

25:42.040 --> 25:47.040
 once you give me a representation for my knowledge,

25:47.260 --> 25:48.280
 then you can ask me,

25:48.280 --> 25:51.680
 now I understand how to represent things.

25:51.680 --> 25:52.800
 How do I discover them?

25:52.800 --> 25:54.040
 It's a secondary thing.

25:54.920 --> 25:57.040
 So first of all, I should echo the statement

25:57.040 --> 25:59.840
 that mathematics and the current,

25:59.840 --> 26:04.280
 much of the machine learning world has not considered

26:04.280 --> 26:07.880
 causation that A causes B, just in anything.

26:07.880 --> 26:12.880
 So that seems like a non obvious thing

26:15.360 --> 26:18.280
 that you think we would have really acknowledged it,

26:18.280 --> 26:19.200
 but we haven't.

26:19.200 --> 26:21.080
 So we have to put that on the table.

26:21.080 --> 26:26.080
 So knowledge, how hard is it to create a knowledge

26:26.420 --> 26:28.480
 from which to work?

26:28.480 --> 26:31.280
 In certain area, it's easy,

26:31.280 --> 26:36.080
 because we have only four or five major variables,

26:37.400 --> 26:41.560
 and an epidemiologist or an economist can put them down,

26:43.440 --> 26:48.440
 what, minimum wage, unemployment, policy, X, Y, Z,

26:52.040 --> 26:54.320
 and start collecting data,

26:54.320 --> 26:59.160
 and quantify the parameters that were left unquantified

27:00.240 --> 27:01.560
 with the initial knowledge.

27:01.560 --> 27:06.560
 That's the routine work that you find

27:07.680 --> 27:12.680
 in experimental psychology, in economics, everywhere.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.600
 In the health science, that's a routine thing.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.800
 But I should emphasize,

27:18.800 --> 27:21.240
 you should start with the research question.

27:21.240 --> 27:24.880
 What do you want to estimate?

27:24.880 --> 27:27.480
 Once you have that, you have to have a language

27:27.480 --> 27:30.200
 of expressing what you want to estimate.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.680
 You think it's easy?

27:31.680 --> 27:32.760
 No.

27:32.760 --> 27:34.880
 So we can talk about two things, I think.

27:35.840 --> 27:40.840
 One is how the science of causation is very useful

27:42.920 --> 27:47.360
 for answering certain questions.

27:47.360 --> 27:51.240
 And then the other is, how do we create intelligent systems

27:51.240 --> 27:53.600
 that need to reason with causation?

27:53.600 --> 27:55.200
 So if my research question is,

27:55.200 --> 27:58.640
 how do I pick up this water bottle from the table?

28:00.920 --> 28:03.560
 All of the knowledge that is required

28:03.560 --> 28:05.280
 to be able to do that,

28:05.280 --> 28:07.960
 how do we construct that knowledge base?

28:07.960 --> 28:11.000
 Do we return back to the problem

28:11.000 --> 28:13.580
 that we didn't solve in the 80s with expert systems?

28:13.580 --> 28:15.440
 Do we have to solve that problem

28:15.440 --> 28:17.860
 of automated construction of knowledge?

28:19.680 --> 28:23.560
 You're talking about the task

28:23.560 --> 28:26.560
 of eliciting knowledge from an expert.

28:26.560 --> 28:28.520
 Task of eliciting knowledge from an expert,

28:28.520 --> 28:31.540
 or the self discovery of more knowledge,

28:32.720 --> 28:34.240
 more and more knowledge.

28:34.240 --> 28:38.600
 So automating the building of knowledge as much as possible.

28:38.600 --> 28:42.400
 It's a different game in the causal domain,

28:42.400 --> 28:46.480
 because it's essentially the same thing.

28:46.480 --> 28:48.680
 You have to start with some knowledge,

28:48.680 --> 28:51.520
 and you're trying to enrich it.

28:51.520 --> 28:56.460
 But you don't enrich it by asking for more rules.

28:56.460 --> 28:58.960
 You enrich it by asking for the data,

28:58.960 --> 29:01.800
 to look at the data and quantifying,

29:01.800 --> 29:05.520
 and ask queries that you couldn't answer when you started.

29:06.480 --> 29:11.480
 You couldn't because the question is quite complex,

29:11.480 --> 29:16.480
 and it's not within the capability

29:16.600 --> 29:19.840
 of ordinary cognition, of ordinary person,

29:19.840 --> 29:22.320
 or ordinary expert even, to answer.

29:23.200 --> 29:24.920
 So what kind of questions do you think

29:24.920 --> 29:26.960
 we can start to answer?

29:26.960 --> 29:27.800
 Even a simple one.

29:27.800 --> 29:31.200
 Suppose, yeah, I'll start with easy one.

29:31.200 --> 29:32.040
 Let's do it.

29:32.040 --> 29:35.880
 Okay, what's the effect of a drug on recovery?

29:37.520 --> 29:39.500
 What is the aspirin that caused my headache

29:39.500 --> 29:44.500
 to be cured, or what did the television program,

29:44.640 --> 29:46.320
 or the good news I received?

29:47.680 --> 29:49.920
 This is already, you see, it's a difficult question,

29:49.920 --> 29:52.840
 because it's find the cause from effect.

29:53.680 --> 29:55.880
 The easy one is find the effect from cause.

29:56.760 --> 29:57.720
 That's right.

29:57.720 --> 29:59.180
 So first you construct a model,

29:59.180 --> 30:01.280
 saying that this is an important research question.

30:01.280 --> 30:02.840
 This is an important question.

30:02.840 --> 30:04.320
 Then you do.

30:04.320 --> 30:05.520
 I didn't construct a model yet.

30:05.520 --> 30:07.680
 I just said it's an important question.

30:07.680 --> 30:12.280
 And the first exercise is express it mathematically.

30:12.280 --> 30:13.800
 What do you want to do?

30:13.800 --> 30:17.000
 Like, if I tell you what will be the effect

30:17.000 --> 30:21.320
 of taking this drug, you have to say that in mathematics.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.880
 How do you say that?

30:22.880 --> 30:23.720
 Yes.

30:23.720 --> 30:26.400
 Can you write down the question, not the answer?

30:27.720 --> 30:32.420
 I want to find the effect of the drug on my headache.

30:32.420 --> 30:33.260
 Right.

30:33.260 --> 30:34.680
 Write down, write it down.

30:34.680 --> 30:35.920
 That's where the do calculus comes in.

30:35.920 --> 30:36.760
 Yes.

30:36.760 --> 30:38.240
 The do operator, what is the do operator?

30:38.240 --> 30:40.080
 Do operator, yeah.

30:40.080 --> 30:40.920
 Which is nice.

30:40.920 --> 30:43.280
 It's the difference in association and intervention.

30:43.280 --> 30:45.760
 Very beautifully sort of constructed.

30:45.760 --> 30:48.880
 Yeah, so we have a do operator.

30:48.880 --> 30:52.560
 So the do calculus connected on the do operator itself

30:52.560 --> 30:55.560
 connects the operation of doing

30:55.560 --> 30:57.880
 to something that we can see.

30:57.880 --> 30:58.720
 Right.

30:58.720 --> 31:01.740
 So as opposed to the purely observing,

31:01.740 --> 31:05.920
 you're making the choice to change a variable.

31:05.920 --> 31:08.240
 That's what it expresses.

31:08.240 --> 31:10.960
 And then the way that we interpret it,

31:11.840 --> 31:15.400
 the mechanism by which we take your query

31:15.400 --> 31:18.640
 and we translate it into something that we can work with

31:18.640 --> 31:21.040
 is by giving it semantics,

31:21.040 --> 31:23.320
 saying that you have a model of the world

31:23.320 --> 31:26.840
 and you cut off all the incoming error into X

31:26.840 --> 31:30.680
 and you're looking now in the modified mutilated model,

31:30.680 --> 31:33.660
 you ask for the probability of Y.

31:33.660 --> 31:36.360
 That is interpretation of doing X

31:36.360 --> 31:40.240
 because by doing things, you've liberated them

31:40.240 --> 31:45.200
 from all influences that acted upon them earlier

31:45.200 --> 31:49.200
 and you subject them to the tyranny of your muscles.

31:50.080 --> 31:54.040
 So you remove all the questions about causality

31:54.040 --> 31:55.740
 by doing them.

31:55.740 --> 31:56.580
 So you're now.

31:56.580 --> 31:58.160
 There's one level of questions.

31:58.160 --> 31:59.000
 Yeah.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.920
 Answer questions about what will happen if you do things.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.320
 If you do, if you drink the coffee,

32:03.320 --> 32:04.160
 if you take the aspirin.

32:04.160 --> 32:05.320
 Right.

32:05.320 --> 32:10.100
 So how do we get the doing data?

32:11.360 --> 32:15.660
 Now the question is, if we cannot run experiments,

32:16.560 --> 32:20.960
 then we have to rely on observational study.

32:20.960 --> 32:22.560
 So first we could, sorry to interrupt,

32:22.560 --> 32:25.880
 we could run an experiment where we do something,

32:25.880 --> 32:28.200
 where we drink the coffee and this,

32:28.200 --> 32:31.120
 the do operator allows you to sort of be systematic

32:31.120 --> 32:31.960
 about expressing.

32:31.960 --> 32:34.560
 So imagine how the experiment will look like

32:34.560 --> 32:36.880
 even though we cannot physically

32:36.880 --> 32:38.760
 and technologically conduct it.

32:38.760 --> 32:40.600
 I'll give you an example.

32:40.600 --> 32:43.680
 What is the effect of blood pressure on mortality?

32:44.960 --> 32:47.360
 I cannot go down into your vein

32:47.360 --> 32:49.400
 and change your blood pressure,

32:49.400 --> 32:50.800
 but I can ask the question,

32:52.060 --> 32:55.120
 which means I can even have a model of your body.

32:55.120 --> 32:58.600
 I can imagine the effect of your,

32:58.600 --> 33:03.600
 how the blood pressure change will affect your mortality.

33:04.720 --> 33:05.560
 How?

33:05.560 --> 33:09.760
 I go into the model and I conduct this surgery

33:09.760 --> 33:12.080
 about the blood pressure,

33:12.080 --> 33:15.840
 even though physically I can do, I cannot do it.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.760
 Let me ask the quantum mechanics question.

33:19.760 --> 33:22.240
 Does the doing change the observation?

33:23.720 --> 33:28.240
 Meaning the surgery of changing the blood pressure is,

33:28.240 --> 33:29.080
 I mean.

33:29.080 --> 33:31.160
 No, the surgery is,

33:31.160 --> 33:35.440
 I call the very delicate.

33:35.440 --> 33:37.840
 It's very delicate, infinitely delicate.

33:37.840 --> 33:40.760
 Incisive and delicate, which means,

33:40.760 --> 33:44.720
 do means, do X means,

33:44.720 --> 33:46.480
 I'm gonna touch only X.

33:46.480 --> 33:47.320
 Only X.

33:47.320 --> 33:48.760
 Directly into X.

33:50.160 --> 33:52.800
 So that means that I change only things

33:52.800 --> 33:56.800
 which depends on X by virtue of X changing,

33:56.800 --> 34:00.400
 but I don't depend things which are not depend on X.

34:00.400 --> 34:04.240
 Like I wouldn't change your sex or your age,

34:04.240 --> 34:06.080
 I just change your blood pressure.

34:06.880 --> 34:08.720
 So in the case of blood pressure,

34:08.720 --> 34:11.160
 it may be difficult or impossible

34:11.160 --> 34:12.800
 to construct such an experiment.

34:12.800 --> 34:16.560
 No, physically yes, but hypothetically no.

34:16.560 --> 34:17.400
 Hypothetically no.

34:17.400 --> 34:20.720
 If we have a model, that is what the model is for.

34:20.720 --> 34:24.640
 So you conduct surgeries on a model,

34:24.640 --> 34:26.880
 you take it apart, put it back,

34:26.880 --> 34:28.880
 that's the idea of a model.

34:28.880 --> 34:31.640
 It's the idea of thinking counterfactually, imagining,

34:31.640 --> 34:35.120
 and that's the idea of creativity.

34:35.120 --> 34:36.400
 So by constructing that model,

34:36.400 --> 34:41.400
 you can start to infer if the higher the blood pressure

34:43.040 --> 34:47.320
 leads to mortality, which increases or decreases by.

34:47.320 --> 34:50.800
 I construct the model, I still cannot answer it.

34:50.800 --> 34:53.800
 I have to see if I have enough information in the model

34:53.800 --> 34:58.360
 that would allow me to find out the effects of intervention

34:58.360 --> 35:03.360
 from a noninterventional study, hence of study.

35:04.520 --> 35:06.240
 So what's needed?

35:06.240 --> 35:11.240
 You need to have assumptions about who affects whom.

35:13.480 --> 35:16.400
 If the graph had a certain property,

35:16.400 --> 35:20.560
 the answer is yes, you can get it from observational study.

35:20.560 --> 35:23.760
 If the graph is too mushy, bushy, bushy,

35:23.760 --> 35:25.680
 the answer is no, you cannot.

35:25.680 --> 35:30.680
 Then you need to find either different kind of observation

35:30.680 --> 35:34.120
 that you haven't considered, or one experiment.

35:35.120 --> 35:38.880
 So basically, that puts a lot of pressure on you

35:38.880 --> 35:41.920
 to encode wisdom into that graph.

35:41.920 --> 35:42.960
 Correct.

35:42.960 --> 35:47.520
 But you don't have to encode more than what you know.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.680
 God forbid, if you put the,

35:49.680 --> 35:51.400
 like economists are doing this,

35:51.400 --> 35:52.880
 they call identifying assumption.

35:52.880 --> 35:55.120
 They put assumptions, even if they don't prevail

35:55.120 --> 35:56.840
 in the world, they put assumptions

35:56.840 --> 35:59.240
 so they can identify things.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.480
 But the problem is, yes, beautifully put,

36:01.480 --> 36:04.440
 but the problem is you don't know what you don't know.

36:04.440 --> 36:05.920
 So.

36:05.920 --> 36:07.560
 You know what you don't know.

36:07.560 --> 36:10.600
 Because if you don't know, you say it's possible.

36:10.600 --> 36:15.600
 It's possible that X affect the traffic tomorrow.

36:17.720 --> 36:18.640
 It's possible.

36:18.640 --> 36:20.880
 You put down an arrow which says it's possible.

36:20.880 --> 36:23.960
 Every arrow in the graph says it's possible.

36:23.960 --> 36:28.000
 So there's not a significant cost to adding arrows that.

36:28.000 --> 36:32.240
 The more arrow you add, the less likely you are

36:32.240 --> 36:36.420
 to identify things from purely observational data.

36:37.680 --> 36:39.520
 So if the whole world is bushy,

36:41.360 --> 36:45.400
 and everybody affect everybody else,

36:45.400 --> 36:49.160
 the answer is, you can answer it ahead of time.

36:49.160 --> 36:54.160
 I cannot answer my query from observational data.

36:54.240 --> 36:55.680
 I have to go to experiments.

36:56.640 --> 36:58.360
 So you talk about machine learning

36:58.360 --> 37:01.600
 is essentially learning by association,

37:01.600 --> 37:03.120
 or reasoning by association,

37:03.120 --> 37:07.120
 and this do calculus is allowing for intervention.

37:07.120 --> 37:07.960
 I like that word.

37:09.000 --> 37:09.840
 Action.

37:09.840 --> 37:12.400
 So you also talk about counterfactuals.

37:12.400 --> 37:13.220
 Yeah.

37:13.220 --> 37:15.880
 And trying to sort of understand the difference

37:15.880 --> 37:19.360
 between counterfactuals and intervention.

37:19.360 --> 37:22.320
 First of all, what is counterfactuals,

37:22.320 --> 37:25.120
 and why are they useful?

37:26.200 --> 37:29.700
 Why are they especially useful,

37:29.700 --> 37:34.700
 as opposed to just reasoning what effect actions have?

37:34.880 --> 37:37.040
 Well, counterfactual contains

37:37.040 --> 37:40.280
 what we normally call explanations.

37:40.280 --> 37:41.600
 Can you give an example of a counterfactual?

37:41.600 --> 37:45.240
 If I tell you that acting one way affects something else,

37:45.240 --> 37:46.840
 I didn't explain anything yet.

37:47.720 --> 37:52.720
 But if I ask you, was it the aspirin that cured my headache?

37:55.400 --> 37:58.640
 I'm asking for explanation, what cured my headache?

37:58.640 --> 38:03.640
 And putting a finger on aspirin provide an explanation.

38:04.640 --> 38:08.160
 It was aspirin that was responsible

38:08.160 --> 38:11.560
 for your headache going away.

38:11.560 --> 38:14.420
 If you didn't take the aspirin,

38:14.420 --> 38:16.000
 you would still have a headache.

38:16.000 --> 38:20.280
 So by saying if I didn't take aspirin,

38:20.280 --> 38:22.760
 I would have a headache, you're thereby saying

38:22.760 --> 38:26.360
 that aspirin is the thing that removes the headache.

38:26.360 --> 38:30.440
 But you have to have another important information.

38:30.440 --> 38:33.680
 I took the aspirin, and my headache is gone.

38:34.560 --> 38:36.400
 It's very important information.

38:36.400 --> 38:38.080
 Now I'm reasoning backward,

38:38.080 --> 38:40.520
 and I said, was it the aspirin?

38:40.520 --> 38:42.080
 Yeah.

38:42.080 --> 38:44.440
 By considering what would have happened

38:44.440 --> 38:47.000
 if everything else is the same, but I didn't take aspirin.

38:47.000 --> 38:47.840
 That's right.

38:47.840 --> 38:49.560
 So you know that things took place.

38:51.040 --> 38:56.040
 Joe killed Schmoe, and Schmoe would be alive

38:56.360 --> 38:59.320
 had John not used his gun.

38:59.320 --> 39:02.080
 Okay, so that is the counterfactual.

39:02.080 --> 39:06.640
 It had the conflict here, or clash,

39:06.640 --> 39:09.600
 between observed fact,

39:09.600 --> 39:13.600
 but he did shoot, okay?

39:13.600 --> 39:16.600
 And the hypothetical predicate,

39:16.600 --> 39:18.800
 which says had he not shot,

39:18.800 --> 39:21.540
 you have a logical clash.

39:21.540 --> 39:23.820
 They cannot exist together.

39:23.820 --> 39:24.920
 That's the counterfactual.

39:24.920 --> 39:28.280
 And that is the source of our explanation

39:28.280 --> 39:33.280
 of the idea of responsibility, regret, and free will.

39:34.820 --> 39:37.200
 Yeah, so it certainly seems

39:37.200 --> 39:39.760
 that's the highest level of reasoning, right?

39:39.760 --> 39:41.880
 Yeah, and physicists do it all the time.

39:41.880 --> 39:42.760
 Who does it all the time?

39:42.760 --> 39:43.580
 Physicists.

39:43.580 --> 39:44.920
 Physicists.

39:44.920 --> 39:47.120
 In every equation of physics,

39:47.120 --> 39:49.560
 let's say you have a Hooke's law,

39:49.560 --> 39:52.240
 and you put one kilogram on the spring,

39:52.240 --> 39:54.680
 and the spring is one meter,

39:54.680 --> 39:58.400
 and you say, had this weight been two kilogram,

39:58.400 --> 40:00.400
 the spring would have been twice as long.

40:02.060 --> 40:05.560
 It's no problem for physicists to say that,

40:05.560 --> 40:10.240
 except that mathematics is only in the form of equation,

40:10.240 --> 40:13.280
 okay, equating the weight,

40:14.680 --> 40:18.520
 proportionality constant, and the length of the string.

40:18.520 --> 40:22.080
 So you don't have the asymmetry

40:22.080 --> 40:23.280
 in the equation of physics,

40:23.280 --> 40:26.840
 although every physicist thinks counterfactually.

40:26.840 --> 40:29.160
 Ask the high school kids,

40:29.160 --> 40:31.120
 had the weight been three kilograms,

40:31.120 --> 40:33.360
 what would be the length of the spring?

40:33.360 --> 40:35.160
 They can answer it immediately,

40:35.160 --> 40:38.760
 because they do the counterfactual processing in their mind,

40:38.760 --> 40:41.120
 and then they put it into equation,

40:41.120 --> 40:44.280
 algebraic equation, and they solve it, okay?

40:44.280 --> 40:46.720
 But a robot cannot do that.

40:46.720 --> 40:51.000
 How do you make a robot learn these relationships?

40:51.000 --> 40:53.240
 Well, why you would learn?

40:53.240 --> 40:55.560
 Suppose you tell him, can you do it?

40:55.560 --> 40:57.520
 So before you go learning,

40:57.520 --> 40:59.360
 you have to ask yourself,

40:59.360 --> 41:01.820
 suppose I give you all the information, okay?

41:01.820 --> 41:06.820
 Can the robot perform the task that I ask him to perform?

41:07.820 --> 41:10.980
 Can he reason and say, no, it wasn't the aspirin.

41:10.980 --> 41:13.320
 It was the good news you received on the phone.

41:15.500 --> 41:19.620
 Right, because, well, unless the robot had a model,

41:19.620 --> 41:23.620
 a causal model of the world.

41:23.620 --> 41:24.740
 Right, right.

41:24.740 --> 41:26.260
 I'm sorry I have to linger on this.

41:26.260 --> 41:27.860
 But now we have to linger and we have to say,

41:27.860 --> 41:29.100
 how do we do it?

41:29.100 --> 41:29.940
 How do we build it?

41:29.940 --> 41:30.760
 Yes.

41:30.760 --> 41:32.180
 How do we build a causal model

41:32.180 --> 41:37.180
 without a team of human experts running around?

41:37.260 --> 41:39.560
 Why don't you go to learning right away?

41:39.560 --> 41:41.180
 You're too much involved with learning.

41:41.180 --> 41:42.100
 Because I like babies.

41:42.100 --> 41:43.140
 Babies learn fast.

41:43.140 --> 41:45.140
 I'm trying to figure out how they do it.

41:45.140 --> 41:45.980
 Good.

41:45.980 --> 41:47.660
 So that's another question.

41:47.660 --> 41:50.340
 How do the babies come out with a counterfactual

41:50.340 --> 41:51.760
 model of the world?

41:51.760 --> 41:53.540
 And babies do that.

41:53.540 --> 41:56.860
 They know how to play in the crib.

41:56.860 --> 41:59.500
 They know which balls hit another one.

41:59.500 --> 42:04.500
 And they learn it by playful manipulation of the world.

42:06.820 --> 42:07.660
 Yes.

42:07.660 --> 42:11.880
 The simple world involves only toys and balls and chimes.

42:13.620 --> 42:17.260
 But if you think about it, it's a complex world.

42:17.260 --> 42:20.700
 We take for granted how complicated.

42:20.700 --> 42:23.740
 And kids do it by playful manipulation

42:23.740 --> 42:28.740
 plus parents guidance, peer wisdom, and hearsay.

42:30.860 --> 42:34.780
 They meet each other and they say,

42:34.780 --> 42:38.940
 you shouldn't have taken my toy.

42:38.940 --> 42:39.780
 Right.

42:40.820 --> 42:43.540
 And these multiple sources of information,

42:43.540 --> 42:44.900
 they're able to integrate.

42:45.780 --> 42:49.260
 So the challenge is about how to integrate,

42:49.260 --> 42:52.620
 how to form these causal relationships

42:52.620 --> 42:54.260
 from different sources of data.

42:54.260 --> 42:55.600
 Correct.

42:55.600 --> 42:59.980
 So how much information is it to play,

42:59.980 --> 43:03.060
 how much causal information is required

43:03.060 --> 43:06.900
 to be able to play in the crib with different objects?

43:06.900 --> 43:08.260
 I don't know.

43:08.260 --> 43:11.340
 I haven't experimented with the crib.

43:11.340 --> 43:12.700
 Okay, not a crib.

43:12.700 --> 43:15.860
 Picking up, manipulating physical objects

43:15.860 --> 43:19.800
 on this very, opening the pages of a book,

43:19.800 --> 43:23.740
 all the tasks, the physical manipulation tasks.

43:23.740 --> 43:25.260
 Do you have a sense?

43:25.260 --> 43:27.980
 Because my sense is the world is extremely complicated.

43:27.980 --> 43:29.420
 It's extremely complicated.

43:29.420 --> 43:31.260
 I agree, and I don't know how to organize it

43:31.260 --> 43:34.660
 because I've been spoiled by easy problems

43:34.660 --> 43:37.240
 such as cancer and death, okay?

43:37.240 --> 43:39.820
 And I'm a, but she's a.

43:39.820 --> 43:41.060
 First we have to start trying to.

43:41.060 --> 43:42.660
 No, but it's easy.

43:42.660 --> 43:46.980
 There is in a sense that you have only 20 variables.

43:46.980 --> 43:51.060
 And they are just variables and not mechanics.

43:51.060 --> 43:52.300
 Okay, it's easy.

43:52.300 --> 43:56.060
 You just put them on the graph and they speak to you.

43:57.980 --> 44:00.540
 Yeah, and you're providing a methodology

44:00.540 --> 44:02.380
 for letting them speak.

44:02.380 --> 44:03.220
 Yeah.

44:03.220 --> 44:05.140
 I'm working only in the abstract.

44:05.140 --> 44:08.980
 The abstract was knowledge in, knowledge out,

44:08.980 --> 44:10.740
 data in between.

44:11.820 --> 44:15.100
 Now, can we take a leap to trying to learn

44:15.100 --> 44:18.140
 in this very, when it's not 20 variables,

44:18.140 --> 44:23.140
 but 20 million variables, trying to learn causation

44:23.180 --> 44:24.060
 in this world?

44:24.060 --> 44:27.180
 Not learn, but somehow construct models.

44:27.180 --> 44:29.620
 I mean, it seems like you would only have to be able

44:29.620 --> 44:33.920
 to learn because constructing it manually

44:33.920 --> 44:35.580
 would be too difficult.

44:35.580 --> 44:36.900
 Do you have ideas of?

44:37.900 --> 44:41.220
 I think it's a matter of combining simple models

44:41.220 --> 44:45.460
 from many, many sources, from many, many disciplines,

44:45.460 --> 44:46.980
 and many metaphors.

44:48.220 --> 44:51.940
 Metaphors are the basics of human intelligence, basis.

44:51.940 --> 44:53.940
 Yeah, so how do you think of about a metaphor

44:53.940 --> 44:56.180
 in terms of its use in human intelligence?

44:56.180 --> 45:00.280
 Metaphors is an expert system.

45:01.900 --> 45:05.700
 An expert, it's mapping problem

45:05.700 --> 45:09.580
 from a problem with which you are not familiar

45:09.580 --> 45:13.800
 to a problem with which you are familiar.

45:13.800 --> 45:15.980
 Like, I'll give you a good example.

45:15.980 --> 45:20.980
 The Greek believed that the sky is an opaque shell.

45:22.240 --> 45:25.940
 It's not really infinite space.

45:25.940 --> 45:29.340
 It's an opaque shell, and the stars are holes

45:30.580 --> 45:32.980
 poked in the shells through which you see

45:32.980 --> 45:34.260
 the eternal light.

45:34.260 --> 45:35.940
 That was a metaphor.

45:35.940 --> 45:36.960
 Why?

45:36.960 --> 45:41.000
 Because they understand how you poke holes in the shells.

45:42.800 --> 45:45.760
 They were not familiar with infinite space.

45:47.260 --> 45:52.260
 And we are walking on a shell of a turtle,

45:52.780 --> 45:54.520
 and if you get too close to the edge,

45:54.520 --> 45:56.940
 you're gonna fall down to Hades or wherever.

45:58.940 --> 45:59.900
 That's a metaphor.

46:00.780 --> 46:02.180
 It's not true.

46:02.180 --> 46:07.180
 But this kind of metaphor enabled Aristoteles

46:07.220 --> 46:10.680
 to measure the radius of the Earth,

46:10.680 --> 46:15.140
 because he said, Kamal, if we are walking on a turtle shell,

46:15.140 --> 46:18.140
 then the ray of light coming to this place

46:20.700 --> 46:23.040
 will be a different angle than coming to this place.

46:23.040 --> 46:26.420
 I know the distance, I'll measure the two angles,

46:26.420 --> 46:31.420
 and then I have the radius of the shell of the turtle.

46:33.640 --> 46:38.460
 And he did, and he found his measurement

46:38.460 --> 46:42.320
 very close to the measurements we have today,

46:43.300 --> 46:48.300
 through the, what, 6,700 kilometers of the Earth.

46:52.020 --> 46:55.060
 That's something that would not occur

46:55.060 --> 46:59.760
 to Babylonian astronomer,

46:59.760 --> 47:01.900
 even though the Babylonian experiment

47:01.900 --> 47:04.600
 were the machine learning people of the time.

47:04.600 --> 47:07.900
 They fit curves, and they could predict

47:07.900 --> 47:12.220
 the eclipse of the moon much more accurately

47:12.220 --> 47:14.800
 than the Greek, because they fit curve.

47:17.160 --> 47:19.220
 That's a different metaphor.

47:19.220 --> 47:20.580
 Something that you're familiar with,

47:20.580 --> 47:21.820
 a game, a turtle shell.

47:21.820 --> 47:22.660
 Okay?

47:24.380 --> 47:27.520
 What does it mean if you are familiar?

47:27.520 --> 47:31.900
 Familiar means that answers to certain questions

47:31.900 --> 47:33.460
 are explicit.

47:33.460 --> 47:35.580
 You don't have to derive them.

47:35.580 --> 47:39.700
 And they were made explicit because somewhere in the past

47:39.700 --> 47:42.400
 you've constructed a model of that.

47:43.540 --> 47:44.940
 Yeah, you're familiar with,

47:44.940 --> 47:48.340
 so the child is familiar with billiard balls.

47:48.340 --> 47:51.420
 So the child could predict that if you let loose

47:51.420 --> 47:54.180
 of one ball, the other one will bounce off.

47:55.740 --> 48:00.180
 You obtain that by familiarity.

48:00.180 --> 48:02.920
 Familiarity is answering questions,

48:02.920 --> 48:05.880
 and you store the answer explicitly.

48:05.880 --> 48:08.020
 You don't have to derive them.

48:08.020 --> 48:09.620
 So this is the idea of a metaphor.

48:09.620 --> 48:11.620
 All our life, all our intelligence

48:11.620 --> 48:13.420
 is built around metaphors,

48:13.420 --> 48:16.220
 mapping from the unfamiliar to the familiar.

48:16.220 --> 48:20.540
 But the marriage between the two is a tough thing,

48:20.540 --> 48:24.740
 which we haven't yet been able to algorithmatize.

48:24.740 --> 48:29.300
 So you think of that process of using metaphor

48:29.300 --> 48:31.180
 to leap from one place to another,

48:31.900 --> 48:33.540
 we can call it reasoning?

48:34.540 --> 48:35.900
 Is it a kind of reasoning?

48:35.900 --> 48:39.500
 It is reasoning by metaphor, metaphorical reasoning.

48:39.500 --> 48:43.060
 Do you think of that as learning?

48:44.220 --> 48:46.500
 So learning is a popular terminology today

48:46.500 --> 48:47.620
 in a narrow sense.

48:47.620 --> 48:49.780
 It is, it is, it is definitely a form.

48:49.780 --> 48:51.620
 So you may not, okay, right.

48:51.620 --> 48:53.780
 It's one of the most important learnings,

48:53.780 --> 48:57.620
 taking something which theoretically is derivable

48:57.620 --> 49:01.700
 and store it in accessible format.

49:01.700 --> 49:05.580
 I'll give you an example, chess, okay?

49:07.780 --> 49:12.780
 Finding the winning starting move in chess is hard.

49:12.780 --> 49:17.780
 It is hard, but there is an answer.

49:21.260 --> 49:23.780
 Either there is a winning move for white

49:23.780 --> 49:26.820
 or there isn't, or there is a draw, okay?

49:26.820 --> 49:30.260
 So it is, the answer to that

49:30.260 --> 49:33.700
 is available through the rule of the games.

49:33.700 --> 49:35.460
 But we don't know the answer.

49:35.460 --> 49:38.500
 So what does a chess master have that we don't have?

49:38.500 --> 49:41.780
 He has stored explicitly an evaluation

49:41.780 --> 49:45.340
 of certain complex pattern of the board.

49:45.340 --> 49:46.180
 We don't have it.

49:46.180 --> 49:50.020
 Ordinary people like me, I don't know about you,

49:50.940 --> 49:52.820
 I'm not a chess master.

49:52.820 --> 49:57.820
 So for me, I have to derive things that for him is explicit.

49:58.620 --> 50:02.500
 He has seen it before, or he has seen the pattern before,

50:02.500 --> 50:05.100
 or similar pattern, you see metaphor, yeah?

50:05.100 --> 50:12.100
 And he generalize and said, don't move, it's a dangerous move.

50:13.460 --> 50:15.540
 It's just that not in the game of chess,

50:15.540 --> 50:18.940
 but in the game of billiard balls,

50:18.940 --> 50:22.420
 we humans are able to initially derive very effectively

50:22.420 --> 50:25.100
 and then reason by metaphor very effectively

50:25.100 --> 50:28.700
 and make it look so easy that it makes one wonder

50:28.700 --> 50:31.260
 how hard is it to build it in a machine.

50:31.260 --> 50:36.260
 So in your sense, how far away are we

50:38.260 --> 50:40.660
 to be able to construct?

50:40.660 --> 50:42.780
 I don't know, I'm not a futurist.

50:42.780 --> 50:47.780
 All I can tell you is that we are making tremendous progress

50:48.380 --> 50:51.260
 in the causal reasoning domain.

50:52.100 --> 50:57.100
 Something that I even dare to call it revolution,

50:57.100 --> 51:02.100
 the code of revolution, because what we have achieved

51:02.780 --> 51:07.780
 in the past three decades is something that dwarf

51:09.660 --> 51:13.660
 everything that was derived in the entire history.

51:13.660 --> 51:15.860
 So there's an excitement about

51:15.860 --> 51:18.700
 current machine learning methodologies,

51:18.700 --> 51:22.100
 and there's really important good work you're doing

51:22.100 --> 51:24.620
 in causal inference.

51:24.620 --> 51:29.620
 Where does the future, where do these worlds collide

51:32.980 --> 51:35.060
 and what does that look like?

51:35.060 --> 51:37.780
 First, they're gonna work without collision.

51:37.780 --> 51:40.580
 It's gonna work in harmony.

51:40.580 --> 51:41.740
 Harmony, it's not collision.

51:41.740 --> 51:46.740
 The human is going to jumpstart the exercise

51:46.740 --> 51:53.740
 by providing qualitative, noncommitting models

51:55.060 --> 52:00.060
 of how the universe works, how in reality

52:00.300 --> 52:03.780
 the domain of discourse works.

52:03.780 --> 52:06.820
 The machine is gonna take over from that point of view

52:06.820 --> 52:11.820
 and derive whatever the calculus says can be derived.

52:11.820 --> 52:15.100
 Namely, quantitative answer to our questions.

52:15.100 --> 52:18.420
 Now, these are complex questions.

52:18.420 --> 52:21.220
 I'll give you some example of complex questions

52:21.220 --> 52:26.220
 that will bug your mind if you think about it.

52:27.580 --> 52:32.580
 You take result of studies in diverse population

52:33.660 --> 52:38.660
 under diverse condition, and you infer the cause effect

52:38.660 --> 52:43.140
 of a new population which doesn't even resemble

52:43.140 --> 52:48.140
 any of the ones studied, and you do that by do calculus.

52:48.300 --> 52:52.660
 You do that by generalizing from one study to another.

52:52.660 --> 52:54.940
 See, what's common with Berto?

52:54.940 --> 52:57.020
 What is different?

52:57.020 --> 53:01.180
 Let's ignore the differences and pull out the commonality,

53:01.180 --> 53:06.140
 and you do it over maybe 100 hospitals around the world.

53:06.140 --> 53:11.140
 From that, you can get really mileage from big data.

53:11.140 --> 53:15.060
 It's not only that you have many samples,

53:15.060 --> 53:18.740
 you have many sources of data.

53:18.740 --> 53:21.340
 So that's a really powerful thing, I think,

53:21.340 --> 53:23.420
 especially for medical applications.

53:23.420 --> 53:25.860
 I mean, cure cancer, right?

53:25.860 --> 53:28.580
 That's how from data you can cure cancer.

53:28.580 --> 53:30.100
 So we're talking about causation,

53:30.100 --> 53:35.100
 which is the temporal relationships between things.

53:35.180 --> 53:38.700
 Not only temporal, it's both structural and temporal.

53:38.700 --> 53:43.020
 Temporal enough, temporal precedence by itself

53:43.020 --> 53:45.220
 cannot replace causation.

53:46.820 --> 53:50.900
 Is temporal precedence the arrow of time in physics?

53:50.900 --> 53:52.220
 It's important, necessary.

53:52.220 --> 53:53.060
 It's important.

53:53.060 --> 53:54.260
 It's efficient, yes.

53:54.260 --> 53:55.780
 Is it?

53:55.780 --> 54:00.220
 Yes, I never seen cause propagate backward.

54:00.220 --> 54:03.940
 But if we use the word cause,

54:03.940 --> 54:07.060
 but there's relationships that are timeless.

54:07.060 --> 54:10.380
 I suppose that's still forward in the arrow of time.

54:10.380 --> 54:14.860
 But are there relationships, logical relationships,

54:14.860 --> 54:17.140
 that fit into the structure?

54:18.580 --> 54:21.980
 Sure, the whole do calculus is logical relationship.

54:21.980 --> 54:23.780
 That doesn't require a temporal.

54:23.780 --> 54:25.540
 It has just the condition that

54:26.940 --> 54:28.580
 you're not traveling back in time.

54:28.580 --> 54:31.180
 Yes, correct.

54:31.180 --> 54:34.020
 So it's really a generalization of,

54:34.020 --> 54:39.020
 a powerful generalization of what?

54:39.740 --> 54:40.700
 Of Boolean logic.

54:40.700 --> 54:41.700
 Yeah, Boolean logic.

54:41.700 --> 54:42.540
 Yes.

54:43.460 --> 54:46.260
 That is sort of simply put,

54:46.260 --> 54:51.260
 and allows us to reason about the order of events,

54:53.620 --> 54:54.460
 the source, the.

54:54.460 --> 54:58.020
 Not about, between, we're not deriving the order of events.

54:58.020 --> 55:01.340
 We are given cause effects relationship, okay?

55:01.340 --> 55:06.340
 They ought to be obeying the time presidents relationship.

55:08.900 --> 55:09.940
 We are given it.

55:09.940 --> 55:12.500
 And now that we ask questions about

55:12.500 --> 55:14.260
 other causes of relationship,

55:14.260 --> 55:17.860
 that could be derived from the initial ones,

55:17.860 --> 55:19.980
 but were not given to us explicitly.

55:20.940 --> 55:25.940
 Like the case of the firing squad I gave you

55:26.260 --> 55:28.220
 in the first chapter.

55:28.220 --> 55:33.220
 And I ask, what if rifleman A declined to shoot?

55:33.860 --> 55:36.100
 Would the prisoner still be dead?

55:37.940 --> 55:42.020
 To decline to shoot, it means that he disobey order.

55:42.020 --> 55:46.700
 And the rule of the games were that he is a

55:48.180 --> 55:51.820
 obedient marksman, okay?

55:51.820 --> 55:52.660
 That's how you start.

55:52.660 --> 55:53.500
 That's the initial order.

55:53.500 --> 55:56.540
 But now you ask question about breaking the rules.

55:56.540 --> 56:00.420
 What if he decided not to pull the trigger?

56:00.420 --> 56:02.140
 He just became a pacifist.

56:03.620 --> 56:06.020
 And you and I can answer that.

56:06.020 --> 56:09.220
 The other rifleman would have killed him, okay?

56:09.220 --> 56:10.740
 I want the machine to do that.

56:12.300 --> 56:15.420
 Is it so hard to ask a machine to do that?

56:15.420 --> 56:16.740
 It's such a simple task.

56:16.740 --> 56:19.380
 You have to have a calculus for that.

56:19.380 --> 56:21.180
 Yes, yeah.

56:21.180 --> 56:24.300
 But the curiosity, the natural curiosity for me is

56:24.300 --> 56:27.980
 that yes, you're absolutely correct and important.

56:27.980 --> 56:31.060
 And it's hard to believe that we haven't done this

56:31.060 --> 56:35.380
 seriously extensively already a long time ago.

56:35.380 --> 56:37.020
 So this is really important work.

56:37.020 --> 56:41.340
 But I also wanna know, maybe you can philosophize

56:41.340 --> 56:43.340
 about how hard is it to learn.

56:43.340 --> 56:44.420
 Okay, let's assume we're learning.

56:44.420 --> 56:45.620
 We wanna learn it, okay?

56:45.620 --> 56:46.460
 We wanna learn.

56:46.460 --> 56:47.280
 So what do we do?

56:47.280 --> 56:51.980
 We put a learning machine that watches execution trials

56:51.980 --> 56:56.980
 in many countries and many locations, okay?

56:57.220 --> 57:01.040
 All the machine can learn is to see shut or not shut.

57:01.040 --> 57:02.920
 Dead, not dead.

57:02.920 --> 57:05.620
 A court issued an order or didn't, okay?

57:05.620 --> 57:07.340
 Just the facts.

57:07.340 --> 57:10.140
 For the fact you don't know who listens to whom.

57:10.140 --> 57:13.740
 You don't know that the condemned person

57:13.740 --> 57:15.280
 listened to the bullets,

57:15.280 --> 57:19.300
 that the bullets are listening to the captain, okay?

57:19.300 --> 57:24.300
 All we hear is one command, two shots, dead, okay?

57:24.300 --> 57:27.100
 A triple of variable.

57:27.100 --> 57:29.300
 Yes, no, yes, no.

57:29.300 --> 57:32.140
 Okay, that you can learn who listens to whom

57:32.140 --> 57:33.980
 and you can answer the question, no.

57:33.980 --> 57:35.220
 Definitively no.

57:35.220 --> 57:39.120
 But don't you think you can start proposing ideas

57:39.120 --> 57:40.460
 for humans to review?

57:41.660 --> 57:44.380
 You want machine to learn, you want a robot.

57:44.380 --> 57:49.380
 So robot is watching trials like that, 200 trials,

57:50.780 --> 57:52.580
 and then he has to answer the question,

57:52.580 --> 57:56.920
 what if rifleman A refrain from shooting?

57:56.920 --> 57:57.760
 Yeah.

57:58.660 --> 58:00.260
 How do I do that?

58:00.260 --> 58:03.620
 That's exactly my point.

58:03.620 --> 58:04.900
 It's looking at the facts,

58:04.900 --> 58:07.140
 don't give you the strings behind the facts.

58:07.140 --> 58:11.860
 Absolutely, but do you think of machine learning

58:11.860 --> 58:15.220
 as it's currently defined as only something

58:15.220 --> 58:17.620
 that looks at the facts and tries to do?

58:17.620 --> 58:19.180
 Right now, they only look at the facts, yeah.

58:19.180 --> 58:23.500
 So is there a way to modify, in your sense?

58:23.500 --> 58:25.140
 Playful manipulation.

58:25.140 --> 58:26.140
 Playful manipulation.

58:26.140 --> 58:26.980
 Yes, once in a while.

58:26.980 --> 58:29.700
 Doing the interventionist kind of thing, intervention.

58:29.700 --> 58:31.140
 But it could be at random.

58:31.140 --> 58:34.540
 For instance, the rifleman is sick that day

58:34.540 --> 58:37.260
 or he just vomits or whatever.

58:37.260 --> 58:41.240
 So machine can observe this unexpected event

58:41.240 --> 58:43.580
 which introduce noise.

58:43.580 --> 58:46.420
 The noise still have to be random

58:46.420 --> 58:51.420
 to be able to relate it to randomized experiment.

58:51.660 --> 58:55.460
 And then you have observational studies

58:55.460 --> 58:59.940
 from which to infer the strings behind the facts.

58:59.940 --> 59:02.980
 It's doable to a certain extent.

59:02.980 --> 59:06.260
 But now that we are expert in what you can do

59:06.260 --> 59:09.080
 once you have a model, we can reason back and say,

59:09.080 --> 59:13.020
 what kind of data you need to build a model.

59:13.020 --> 59:17.300
 Got it, so I know you're not a futurist,

59:17.300 --> 59:19.760
 but are you excited?

59:19.760 --> 59:22.500
 Have you, when you look back at your life,

59:22.500 --> 59:24.540
 longed for the idea of creating

59:24.540 --> 59:25.940
 a human level intelligence system?

59:25.940 --> 59:28.340
 Yeah, I'm driven by that.

59:28.340 --> 59:30.500
 All my life, I'm driven just by one thing.

59:33.780 --> 59:34.900
 But I go slowly.

59:34.900 --> 59:39.380
 I go from what I know to the next step incrementally.

59:39.380 --> 59:42.440
 So without imagining what the end goal looks like.

59:42.440 --> 59:44.860
 Do you imagine what an eight?

59:44.860 --> 59:47.780
 The end goal is gonna be a machine

59:47.780 --> 59:50.900
 that can answer sophisticated questions,

59:50.900 --> 59:53.860
 counterfactuals of regret, compassion,

59:55.500 --> 59:57.840
 responsibility, and free will.

59:59.380 --> 1:00:01.620
 So what is a good test?

1:00:01.620 --> 1:00:04.980
 Is a Turing test a reasonable test?

1:00:04.980 --> 1:00:06.780
 A test of free will doesn't exist yet.

1:00:08.380 --> 1:00:09.940
 How would you test free will?

1:00:10.940 --> 1:00:12.540
 So far, we know only one thing.

1:00:14.940 --> 1:00:19.940
 If robots can communicate with reward and punishment

1:00:20.500 --> 1:00:25.420
 among themselves and hitting each other on the wrist

1:00:25.420 --> 1:00:27.820
 and say, you shouldn't have done that, okay?

1:00:27.820 --> 1:00:32.260
 Playing better soccer because they can do that.

1:00:33.900 --> 1:00:35.940
 What do you mean, because they can do that?

1:00:35.940 --> 1:00:38.100
 Because they can communicate among themselves.

1:00:38.100 --> 1:00:40.100
 Because of the communication they can do.

1:00:40.100 --> 1:00:42.660
 Because they communicate like us.

1:00:42.660 --> 1:00:44.580
 Reward and punishment, yes.

1:00:44.580 --> 1:00:47.580
 You didn't pass the ball at the right time,

1:00:47.580 --> 1:00:50.060
 and so therefore you're gonna sit on the bench

1:00:50.060 --> 1:00:51.540
 for the next two.

1:00:51.540 --> 1:00:53.660
 If they start communicating like that,

1:00:53.660 --> 1:00:56.380
 the question is, will they play better soccer?

1:00:56.380 --> 1:00:57.660
 As opposed to what?

1:00:57.660 --> 1:00:59.660
 As opposed to what they do now?

1:00:59.660 --> 1:01:04.660
 Without this ability to reason about reward and punishment.

1:01:04.980 --> 1:01:06.420
 Responsibility.

1:01:06.420 --> 1:01:07.940
 And?

1:01:07.940 --> 1:01:08.780
 Artifactions.

1:01:08.780 --> 1:01:11.700
 So far, I can only think about communication.

1:01:11.700 --> 1:01:15.380
 Communication is, and not necessarily natural language,

1:01:15.380 --> 1:01:16.380
 but just communication.

1:01:16.380 --> 1:01:17.580
 Just communication.

1:01:17.580 --> 1:01:21.980
 And that's important to have a quick and effective means

1:01:21.980 --> 1:01:24.100
 of communicating knowledge.

1:01:24.100 --> 1:01:26.460
 If the coach tells you you should have passed the ball,

1:01:26.460 --> 1:01:28.740
 pink, he conveys so much knowledge to you

1:01:28.740 --> 1:01:30.460
 as opposed to what?

1:01:30.460 --> 1:01:32.540
 Go down and change your software.

1:01:33.420 --> 1:01:35.300
 That's the alternative.

1:01:35.300 --> 1:01:37.700
 But the coach doesn't know your software.

1:01:37.700 --> 1:01:39.580
 So how can the coach tell you

1:01:39.580 --> 1:01:41.540
 you should have passed the ball?

1:01:41.540 --> 1:01:44.260
 But our language is very effective.

1:01:44.260 --> 1:01:45.580
 You should have passed the ball.

1:01:45.580 --> 1:01:47.020
 You know your software.

1:01:47.020 --> 1:01:50.940
 You tweak the right module, and next time you don't do it.

1:01:52.180 --> 1:01:53.620
 Now that's for playing soccer,

1:01:53.620 --> 1:01:55.180
 the rules are well defined.

1:01:55.180 --> 1:01:57.420
 No, no, no, no, they're not well defined.

1:01:57.420 --> 1:01:58.820
 When you should pass the ball.

1:01:58.820 --> 1:02:00.020
 Is not well defined.

1:02:00.020 --> 1:02:04.420
 No, it's very soft, very noisy.

1:02:04.420 --> 1:02:06.700
 Yes, you have to do it under pressure.

1:02:06.700 --> 1:02:07.820
 It's art.

1:02:07.820 --> 1:02:11.340
 But in terms of aligning values

1:02:11.340 --> 1:02:14.340
 between computers and humans,

1:02:15.260 --> 1:02:20.220
 do you think this cause and effect type of thinking

1:02:20.220 --> 1:02:22.300
 is important to align the values,

1:02:22.300 --> 1:02:25.540
 values, morals, ethics under which the machines

1:02:25.540 --> 1:02:28.500
 make decisions, is the cause effect

1:02:28.500 --> 1:02:32.100
 where the two can come together?

1:02:32.100 --> 1:02:34.780
 Cause and effect is necessary component

1:02:34.780 --> 1:02:38.300
 to build an ethical machine.

1:02:38.300 --> 1:02:40.460
 Because the machine has to empathize

1:02:40.460 --> 1:02:42.660
 to understand what's good for you,

1:02:42.660 --> 1:02:47.180
 to build a model of you as a recipient,

1:02:47.180 --> 1:02:50.900
 which should be very much, what is compassion?

1:02:50.900 --> 1:02:55.900
 They imagine that you suffer pain as much as me.

1:02:56.020 --> 1:02:57.020
 As much as me.

1:02:57.020 --> 1:03:00.300
 I do have already a model of myself, right?

1:03:00.300 --> 1:03:02.780
 So it's very easy for me to map you to mine.

1:03:02.780 --> 1:03:04.620
 I don't have to rebuild the model.

1:03:04.620 --> 1:03:06.940
 It's much easier to say, oh, you're like me.

1:03:06.940 --> 1:03:09.620
 Okay, therefore I would not hate you.

1:03:09.620 --> 1:03:12.100
 And the machine has to imagine,

1:03:12.100 --> 1:03:14.540
 has to try to fake to be human essentially

1:03:14.540 --> 1:03:19.420
 so you can imagine that you're like me, right?

1:03:19.420 --> 1:03:21.660
 And moreover, who is me?

1:03:21.660 --> 1:03:24.180
 That's the first, that's consciousness.

1:03:24.180 --> 1:03:25.740
 They have a model of yourself.

1:03:26.860 --> 1:03:28.100
 Where do you get this model?

1:03:28.100 --> 1:03:30.980
 You look at yourself as if you are a part

1:03:30.980 --> 1:03:32.380
 of the environment.

1:03:32.380 --> 1:03:33.940
 If you build a model of yourself

1:03:33.940 --> 1:03:36.100
 versus the environment, then you can say,

1:03:36.100 --> 1:03:38.220
 I need to have a model of myself.

1:03:38.220 --> 1:03:41.820
 I have abilities, I have desires and so forth, okay?

1:03:41.820 --> 1:03:44.340
 I have a blueprint of myself though.

1:03:44.340 --> 1:03:46.140
 Not the full detail because I cannot

1:03:46.140 --> 1:03:49.220
 get the whole thing problem.

1:03:49.220 --> 1:03:50.700
 But I have a blueprint.

1:03:50.700 --> 1:03:54.220
 So on that level of a blueprint, I can modify things.

1:03:54.220 --> 1:03:56.580
 I can look at myself in the mirror and say,

1:03:56.580 --> 1:03:59.180
 hmm, if I change this model, tweak this model,

1:03:59.180 --> 1:04:01.140
 I'm gonna perform differently.

1:04:02.340 --> 1:04:04.340
 That is what we mean by free will.

1:04:05.740 --> 1:04:06.940
 And consciousness.

1:04:06.940 --> 1:04:08.260
 And consciousness.

1:04:08.260 --> 1:04:10.380
 What do you think is consciousness?

1:04:10.380 --> 1:04:11.820
 Is it simply self awareness?

1:04:11.820 --> 1:04:14.660
 So including yourself into the model of the world?

1:04:14.660 --> 1:04:15.500
 That's right.

1:04:15.500 --> 1:04:19.620
 Some people tell me, no, this is only part of consciousness.

1:04:19.620 --> 1:04:21.460
 And then they start telling me what they really mean

1:04:21.460 --> 1:04:23.180
 by consciousness, and I lose them.

1:04:24.740 --> 1:04:29.420
 For me, consciousness is having a blueprint

1:04:29.420 --> 1:04:30.420
 of your software.

1:04:31.580 --> 1:04:36.580
 Do you have concerns about the future of AI?

1:04:37.020 --> 1:04:39.660
 All the different trajectories of all of our research?

1:04:39.660 --> 1:04:40.700
 Yes.

1:04:40.700 --> 1:04:43.300
 Where's your hope, where the movement has,

1:04:43.300 --> 1:04:44.380
 where are your concerns?

1:04:44.380 --> 1:04:49.380
 I'm concerned, because I know we are building a new species

1:04:49.500 --> 1:04:54.500
 that has a capability of exceeding our, exceeding us,

1:04:56.820 --> 1:05:01.300
 exceeding our capabilities, and can breed itself

1:05:01.300 --> 1:05:02.540
 and take over the world.

1:05:02.540 --> 1:05:03.580
 Absolutely.

1:05:03.580 --> 1:05:07.660
 It's a new species that is uncontrolled.

1:05:07.660 --> 1:05:10.140
 We don't know the degree to which we control it.

1:05:10.140 --> 1:05:12.660
 We don't even understand what it means

1:05:12.660 --> 1:05:15.180
 to be able to control this new species.

1:05:16.500 --> 1:05:17.740
 So I'm concerned.

1:05:18.660 --> 1:05:21.100
 I don't have anything to add to that,

1:05:21.100 --> 1:05:26.100
 because it's such a gray area, it's unknown.

1:05:26.100 --> 1:05:27.740
 It never happened in history.

1:05:29.820 --> 1:05:34.260
 The only time it happened in history

1:05:34.260 --> 1:05:35.980
 was evolution with human beings.

1:05:37.580 --> 1:05:39.420
 It wasn't very successful, was it?

1:05:39.420 --> 1:05:42.700
 Some people say it was a great success.

1:05:42.700 --> 1:05:46.380
 For us it was, but a few people along the way,

1:05:46.380 --> 1:05:49.340
 a few creatures along the way would not agree.

1:05:49.340 --> 1:05:53.100
 So it's just because it's such a gray area,

1:05:53.100 --> 1:05:54.980
 there's nothing else to say.

1:05:54.980 --> 1:05:56.820
 We have a sample of one.

1:05:56.820 --> 1:05:58.100
 Sample of one.

1:05:58.100 --> 1:05:58.940
 It's us.

1:05:59.860 --> 1:06:04.860
 But some people would look at you and say,

1:06:04.860 --> 1:06:09.780
 yeah, but we were looking to you to help us

1:06:09.780 --> 1:06:13.180
 make sure that the sample two works out okay.

1:06:13.180 --> 1:06:14.860
 We have more than a sample of one.

1:06:14.860 --> 1:06:18.700
 We have theories, and that's a good.

1:06:18.700 --> 1:06:20.740
 We don't need to be statisticians.

1:06:20.740 --> 1:06:25.420
 So sample of one doesn't mean poverty of knowledge.

1:06:25.420 --> 1:06:26.460
 It's not.

1:06:26.460 --> 1:06:30.540
 Sample of one plus theory, conjectural theory,

1:06:30.540 --> 1:06:31.780
 of what could happen.

1:06:32.940 --> 1:06:34.380
 That we do have.

1:06:34.380 --> 1:06:38.260
 But I really feel helpless in contributing

1:06:38.260 --> 1:06:41.980
 to this argument, because I know so little,

1:06:41.980 --> 1:06:46.640
 and my imagination is limited,

1:06:46.640 --> 1:06:50.140
 and I know how much I don't know,

1:06:50.140 --> 1:06:54.480
 and I, but I'm concerned.

1:06:55.540 --> 1:06:57.780
 You were born and raised in Israel.

1:06:57.780 --> 1:06:59.260
 Born and raised in Israel, yes.

1:06:59.260 --> 1:07:03.900
 And later served in Israel military,

1:07:03.900 --> 1:07:05.220
 defense forces.

1:07:05.220 --> 1:07:07.980
 In the Israel Defense Force.

1:07:07.980 --> 1:07:08.820
 Yeah.

1:07:09.720 --> 1:07:13.820
 What did you learn from that experience?

1:07:13.820 --> 1:07:15.140
 From this experience?

1:07:16.540 --> 1:07:18.140
 There's a kibbutz in there as well.

1:07:18.140 --> 1:07:20.540
 Yes, because I was in the nachal,

1:07:20.540 --> 1:07:25.540
 which is a combination of agricultural work

1:07:26.140 --> 1:07:28.540
 and military service.

1:07:28.540 --> 1:07:31.220
 We were supposed, I was really idealist.

1:07:31.220 --> 1:07:36.180
 I wanted to be a member of the kibbutz throughout my life,

1:07:36.180 --> 1:07:38.700
 and to live a communal life,

1:07:38.700 --> 1:07:43.700
 and so I prepared myself for that.

1:07:46.060 --> 1:07:49.980
 Slowly, slowly, I wanted a greater challenge.

1:07:51.360 --> 1:07:55.340
 So that's a far world away, both.

1:07:55.340 --> 1:07:57.780
 What I learned from that, what I can add,

1:07:57.780 --> 1:08:00.300
 it was a miracle.

1:08:01.340 --> 1:08:05.700
 It was a miracle that I served in the 1950s.

1:08:07.700 --> 1:08:09.460
 I don't know how we survived.

1:08:11.380 --> 1:08:13.720
 The country was under austerity.

1:08:15.380 --> 1:08:20.380
 It tripled its population from 600,000 to a million point eight

1:08:21.460 --> 1:08:23.320
 when I finished college.

1:08:23.320 --> 1:08:24.860
 No one went hungry.

1:08:24.860 --> 1:08:28.040
 And austerity, yes.

1:08:29.380 --> 1:08:34.220
 When you wanted to make an omelet in a restaurant,

1:08:34.220 --> 1:08:35.620
 you had to bring your own egg.

1:08:38.140 --> 1:08:43.140
 And they imprisoned people from bringing the food

1:08:43.740 --> 1:08:47.940
 from farming here, from the villages, to the city.

1:08:49.380 --> 1:08:50.780
 But no one went hungry.

1:08:50.780 --> 1:08:53.620
 And I always add to it,

1:08:53.620 --> 1:08:58.620
 and higher education did not suffer any budget cut.

1:09:00.220 --> 1:09:05.220
 They still invested in me, in my wife, in our generation

1:09:05.460 --> 1:09:09.700
 to get the best education that they could, okay?

1:09:09.700 --> 1:09:14.700
 So I'm really grateful for the opportunity,

1:09:15.200 --> 1:09:18.620
 and I'm trying to pay back now, okay?

1:09:18.620 --> 1:09:22.900
 It's a miracle that we survived the war of 1948.

1:09:22.900 --> 1:09:26.340
 We were so close to a second genocide.

1:09:27.260 --> 1:09:29.080
 It was all planned.

1:09:30.160 --> 1:09:32.180
 But we survived it by miracle,

1:09:32.180 --> 1:09:33.580
 and then the second miracle

1:09:33.580 --> 1:09:37.780
 that not many people talk about, the next phase.

1:09:37.780 --> 1:09:40.280
 How no one went hungry,

1:09:40.280 --> 1:09:43.940
 and the country managed to triple its population.

1:09:43.940 --> 1:09:45.300
 You know what it means to triple?

1:09:45.300 --> 1:09:50.220
 Imagine United States going from what, 350 million

1:09:50.220 --> 1:09:53.860
 to a trillion, unbelievable.

1:09:53.860 --> 1:09:57.020
 So it's a really tense part of the world.

1:09:57.020 --> 1:09:59.060
 It's a complicated part of the world,

1:09:59.060 --> 1:10:00.740
 Israel and all around.

1:10:01.820 --> 1:10:06.820
 Religion is at the core of that complexity.

1:10:08.100 --> 1:10:09.460
 One of the components.

1:10:09.460 --> 1:10:12.420
 Religion is a strong motivating cause

1:10:12.420 --> 1:10:16.500
 to many, many people in the Middle East, yes.

1:10:16.500 --> 1:10:21.020
 In your view, looking back, is religion good for society?

1:10:23.180 --> 1:10:25.500
 That's a good question for robotic, you know?

1:10:26.900 --> 1:10:28.300
 There's echoes of that question.

1:10:28.300 --> 1:10:30.980
 Equip robot with religious belief.

1:10:32.260 --> 1:10:34.660
 Suppose we find out, or we agree

1:10:34.660 --> 1:10:37.940
 that religion is good to you, to keep you in line, okay?

1:10:37.940 --> 1:10:42.940
 Should we give the robot the metaphor of a god?

1:10:43.340 --> 1:10:46.460
 As a matter of fact, the robot will get it without us also.

1:10:47.340 --> 1:10:48.180
 Why?

1:10:48.180 --> 1:10:51.020
 The robot will reason by metaphor.

1:10:51.020 --> 1:10:56.020
 And what is the most primitive metaphor

1:10:56.380 --> 1:10:57.580
 a child grows with?

1:10:58.940 --> 1:11:02.940
 Mother smile, father teaching,

1:11:02.940 --> 1:11:05.380
 father image and mother image, that's god.

1:11:05.380 --> 1:11:08.800
 So, whether you want it or not,

1:11:08.800 --> 1:11:12.560
 the robot will, well, assuming that the robot

1:11:12.560 --> 1:11:14.800
 is gonna have a mother and a father,

1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:16.360
 it may only have a programmer,

1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:20.960
 which doesn't supply warmth and discipline.

1:11:20.960 --> 1:11:22.440
 Well, discipline it does.

1:11:22.440 --> 1:11:26.220
 So the robot will have a model of the trainer,

1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:29.320
 and everything that happens in the world,

1:11:29.320 --> 1:11:32.280
 cosmology and so on, is going to be mapped

1:11:32.280 --> 1:11:36.520
 into the programmer, it's god.

1:11:36.520 --> 1:11:41.380
 Man, the thing that represents the origin

1:11:41.380 --> 1:11:43.960
 of everything for that robot.

1:11:43.960 --> 1:11:46.340
 It's the most primitive relationship.

1:11:46.340 --> 1:11:48.680
 So it's gonna arrive there by metaphor.

1:11:48.680 --> 1:11:51.880
 And so the question is if overall

1:11:51.880 --> 1:11:56.200
 that metaphor has served us well as humans.

1:11:56.200 --> 1:11:58.000
 I really don't know.

1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:01.680
 I think it did, but as long as you keep

1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:03.160
 in mind it's only a metaphor.

1:12:05.160 --> 1:12:10.160
 So, if you think we can, can we talk about your son?

1:12:11.580 --> 1:12:13.240
 Yes, yes.

1:12:13.240 --> 1:12:15.080
 Can you tell his story?

1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:15.920
 His story?

1:12:17.180 --> 1:12:18.020
 Daniel?

1:12:18.020 --> 1:12:21.200
 His story is known, he was abducted

1:12:21.200 --> 1:12:26.200
 in Pakistan by Al Qaeda driven sect,

1:12:26.200 --> 1:12:31.200
 and under various pretenses.

1:12:32.040 --> 1:12:35.200
 I don't even pay attention to what the pretence was.

1:12:35.200 --> 1:12:39.840
 Originally they wanted to have the United States

1:12:42.720 --> 1:12:46.120
 deliver some promised airplanes.

1:12:47.520 --> 1:12:51.520
 It was all made up, and all these demands were bogus.

1:12:51.520 --> 1:12:56.520
 Bogus, I don't know really, but eventually

1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:02.000
 he was executed in front of a camera.

1:13:03.680 --> 1:13:07.400
 At the core of that is hate and intolerance.

1:13:07.400 --> 1:13:10.000
 At the core, yes, absolutely, yes.

1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:15.000
 We don't really appreciate the depth of the hate

1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:20.000
 at which billions of peoples are educated.

1:13:26.080 --> 1:13:27.560
 We don't understand it.

1:13:27.560 --> 1:13:31.360
 I just listened recently to what they teach you

1:13:31.360 --> 1:13:32.320
 in Mogadishu.

1:13:32.320 --> 1:13:37.320
 Okay, okay, when the water stopped in the tap,

1:13:45.680 --> 1:13:49.360
 we knew exactly who did it, the Jews.

1:13:49.360 --> 1:13:50.600
 The Jews.

1:13:50.600 --> 1:13:54.020
 We didn't know how, but we knew who did it.

1:13:55.280 --> 1:13:58.080
 We don't appreciate what it means to us.

1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:00.440
 The depth is unbelievable.

1:14:00.440 --> 1:14:04.680
 Do you think all of us are capable of evil?

1:14:06.920 --> 1:14:09.840
 And the education, the indoctrination

1:14:09.840 --> 1:14:10.680
 is really what creates evil.

1:14:10.680 --> 1:14:12.240
 Absolutely we are capable of evil.

1:14:12.240 --> 1:14:17.240
 If you're indoctrinated sufficiently long and in depth,

1:14:18.800 --> 1:14:23.800
 you're capable of ISIS, you're capable of Nazism.

1:14:24.840 --> 1:14:28.400
 Yes, we are, but the question is whether we,

1:14:28.400 --> 1:14:32.840
 after we have gone through some Western education

1:14:32.840 --> 1:14:35.680
 and we learn that everything is really relative.

1:14:35.680 --> 1:14:37.680
 It is not absolute God.

1:14:37.680 --> 1:14:40.120
 It's only a belief in God.

1:14:40.120 --> 1:14:43.520
 Whether we are capable now of being transformed

1:14:43.520 --> 1:14:47.520
 under certain circumstances to become brutal.

1:14:49.920 --> 1:14:50.760
 Yeah.

1:14:51.680 --> 1:14:55.080
 I'm worried about it because some people say yes,

1:14:55.080 --> 1:14:57.360
 given the right circumstances,

1:14:57.360 --> 1:15:02.360
 given bad economical crisis,

1:15:04.120 --> 1:15:06.160
 you are capable of doing it too.

1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:07.240
 That worries me.

1:15:08.420 --> 1:15:10.520
 I want to believe it, I'm not capable.

1:15:12.200 --> 1:15:14.560
 So seven years after Daniel's death,

1:15:14.560 --> 1:15:16.800
 you wrote an article at the Wall Street Journal

1:15:16.800 --> 1:15:19.760
 titled Daniel Pearl and the Normalization of Evil.

1:15:19.760 --> 1:15:20.580
 Yes.

1:15:20.580 --> 1:15:23.040
 What was your message back then

1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:27.560
 and how did it change today over the years?

1:15:27.560 --> 1:15:28.840
 I lost.

1:15:30.600 --> 1:15:31.840
 What was the message?

1:15:31.840 --> 1:15:36.840
 The message was that we are not treating terrorism

1:15:39.960 --> 1:15:40.800
 as a taboo.

1:15:41.840 --> 1:15:46.840
 We are treating it as a bargaining device that is accepted.

1:15:46.840 --> 1:15:51.840
 People have grievance and they go and bomb restaurants.

1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:55.240
 It's normal.

1:15:55.240 --> 1:15:58.180
 Look, you're even not surprised when I tell you that.

1:15:59.600 --> 1:16:01.640
 20 years ago you say, what?

1:16:01.640 --> 1:16:04.060
 For grievance you go and blow a restaurant?

1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:06.960
 Today it's becoming normalized.

1:16:07.960 --> 1:16:09.820
 The banalization of evil.

1:16:11.080 --> 1:16:16.080
 And we have created that to ourselves by normalizing,

1:16:16.080 --> 1:16:21.080
 by making it part of political life.

1:16:23.960 --> 1:16:26.800
 It's a political debate.

1:16:27.760 --> 1:16:32.760
 Every terrorist yesterday becomes a freedom fighter today

1:16:34.440 --> 1:16:36.600
 and tomorrow it becomes terrorist again.

1:16:36.600 --> 1:16:37.680
 It's switchable.

1:16:38.600 --> 1:16:42.220
 Right, and so we should call out evil when there's evil.

1:16:42.220 --> 1:16:46.860
 If we don't want to be part of it.

1:16:46.860 --> 1:16:47.700
 Becoming.

1:16:49.020 --> 1:16:52.300
 Yeah, if we want to separate good from evil,

1:16:52.300 --> 1:16:54.100
 that's one of the first things that,

1:16:55.060 --> 1:16:57.540
 what was it, in the Garden of Eden,

1:16:57.540 --> 1:17:02.540
 remember the first thing that God told him was,

1:17:02.900 --> 1:17:07.380
 hey, you want some knowledge, here's a tree of good and evil.

1:17:07.380 --> 1:17:12.260
 Yeah, so this evil touched your life personally.

1:17:12.260 --> 1:17:17.260
 Does your heart have anger, sadness, or is it hope?

1:17:20.300 --> 1:17:25.300
 Look, I see some beautiful people coming from Pakistan.

1:17:26.140 --> 1:17:29.420
 I see beautiful people everywhere.

1:17:29.420 --> 1:17:34.420
 But I see horrible propagation of evil in this country too.

1:17:38.700 --> 1:17:42.780
 It shows you how populistic slogans

1:17:42.780 --> 1:17:47.260
 can catch the mind of the best intellectuals.

1:17:48.220 --> 1:17:50.100
 Today is Father's Day.

1:17:50.100 --> 1:17:51.060
 I didn't know that.

1:17:51.060 --> 1:17:56.060
 Yeah, what's a fond memory you have of Daniel?

1:17:56.060 --> 1:17:58.380
 What's a fond memory you have of Daniel?

1:17:58.380 --> 1:18:01.760
 Oh, very good memories, immense.

1:18:02.660 --> 1:18:03.920
 He was my mentor.

1:18:06.100 --> 1:18:11.100
 He had a sense of balance that I didn't have.

1:18:15.340 --> 1:18:17.540
 He saw the beauty in every person.

1:18:19.460 --> 1:18:22.020
 He was not as emotional as I am,

1:18:22.020 --> 1:18:26.220
 the more looking things in perspective.

1:18:26.220 --> 1:18:29.340
 He really liked every person.

1:18:29.340 --> 1:18:33.420
 He really grew up with the idea that a foreigner

1:18:34.740 --> 1:18:39.740
 is a reason for curiosity, not for fear.

1:18:42.780 --> 1:18:45.280
 That one time we went in Berkeley,

1:18:45.280 --> 1:18:49.220
 and a homeless came out from some dark alley,

1:18:49.220 --> 1:18:51.180
 and said, hey, man, can you spare a dime?

1:18:51.180 --> 1:18:54.620
 I retreated back, two feet back,

1:18:54.620 --> 1:18:56.220
 and then I just hugged him and say,

1:18:56.220 --> 1:18:58.420
 here's a dime, enjoy yourself.

1:18:58.420 --> 1:19:03.420
 Maybe you want some money to take a bus or whatever.

1:19:05.340 --> 1:19:06.580
 Where did you get it?

1:19:06.580 --> 1:19:07.420
 Not from me.

1:19:10.460 --> 1:19:12.400
 Do you have advice for young minds today,

1:19:12.400 --> 1:19:16.200
 dreaming about creating as you have dreamt,

1:19:16.200 --> 1:19:17.880
 creating intelligent systems?

1:19:17.880 --> 1:19:21.380
 What is the best way to arrive at new breakthrough ideas

1:19:21.380 --> 1:19:23.820
 and carry them through the fire of criticism

1:19:23.820 --> 1:19:27.020
 and past conventional ideas?

1:19:28.780 --> 1:19:33.720
 Ask your questions freely.

1:19:34.920 --> 1:19:36.640
 Your questions are never dumb.

1:19:37.660 --> 1:19:39.380
 And solve them your own way.

1:19:40.700 --> 1:19:42.680
 And don't take no for an answer.

1:19:42.680 --> 1:19:46.240
 Look, if they are really dumb,

1:19:46.240 --> 1:19:49.880
 you will find out quickly by trying an arrow

1:19:49.880 --> 1:19:52.420
 to see that they're not leading any place.

1:19:52.420 --> 1:19:57.420
 But follow them and try to understand things your way.

1:19:59.440 --> 1:20:01.600
 That is my advice.

1:20:01.600 --> 1:20:03.980
 I don't know if it's gonna help anyone.

1:20:03.980 --> 1:20:05.520
 Not as brilliantly.

1:20:05.520 --> 1:20:10.520
 There is a lot of inertia in science, in academia.

1:20:15.120 --> 1:20:17.460
 It is slowing down science.

1:20:18.560 --> 1:20:23.320
 Yeah, those two words, your way, that's a powerful thing.

1:20:23.320 --> 1:20:27.000
 It's against inertia, potentially, against the flow.

1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:28.640
 Against your professor.

1:20:28.640 --> 1:20:30.440
 Against your professor.

1:20:30.440 --> 1:20:34.840
 I wrote the Book of Why in order to democratize

1:20:34.840 --> 1:20:35.960
 common sense.

1:20:38.680 --> 1:20:43.680
 In order to instill rebellious spirit in students

1:20:45.460 --> 1:20:50.000
 so they wouldn't wait until the professor get things right.

1:20:53.720 --> 1:20:56.640
 So you wrote the manifesto of the rebellion

1:20:56.640 --> 1:20:58.360
 against the professor.

1:20:58.360 --> 1:21:00.360
 Against the professor, yes.

1:21:00.360 --> 1:21:02.840
 So looking back at your life of research,

1:21:02.840 --> 1:21:06.200
 what ideas do you hope ripple through the next many decades?

1:21:06.200 --> 1:21:09.460
 What do you hope your legacy will be?

1:21:10.600 --> 1:21:13.600
 I already have a tombstone carved.

1:21:19.880 --> 1:21:21.560
 Oh, boy.

1:21:21.560 --> 1:21:24.840
 The fundamental law of counterfactuals.

1:21:25.840 --> 1:21:29.800
 That's what, it's a simple equation.

1:21:29.800 --> 1:21:34.460
 Counterfactual in terms of a model surgery.

1:21:35.560 --> 1:21:37.960
 That's it, because everything follows from that.

1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:45.000
 If you get that, all the rest, I can die in peace.

1:21:46.600 --> 1:21:49.640
 And my student can derive all my knowledge

1:21:49.640 --> 1:21:51.920
 by mathematical means.

1:21:51.920 --> 1:21:53.520
 The rest follows.

1:21:53.520 --> 1:21:55.040
 Yeah.

1:21:55.040 --> 1:21:56.420
 Thank you so much for talking today.

1:21:56.420 --> 1:21:57.260
 I really appreciate it.

1:21:57.260 --> 1:22:02.260
 Thank you for being so attentive and instigating.

1:22:03.920 --> 1:22:05.240
 We did it.

1:22:05.240 --> 1:22:06.080
 We did it.

1:22:06.080 --> 1:22:07.520
 The coffee helped.

1:22:07.520 --> 1:22:11.280

1:22:39.320 --> 1:22:41.080
 from Judea Pearl.

1:22:41.080 --> 1:22:44.000
 You cannot answer a question that you cannot ask,

1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:47.400
 and you cannot ask a question that you have no words for.

1:22:47.400 --> 1:22:52.400
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
