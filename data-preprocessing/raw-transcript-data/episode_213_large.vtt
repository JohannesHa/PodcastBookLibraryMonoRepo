 The following is a conversation with Barry Barish, a theoretical physicist at Caltech

00:05.360 --> 00:11.440
 and the winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to the LIGO detector

00:11.440 --> 00:18.000
 and the observation of gravitational waves. LIGO, or the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave

00:18.000 --> 00:24.320
 Observatory, is probably the most precise measurement device ever built by humans.

00:24.320 --> 00:31.680
 It consists of two detectors with four kilometer long vacuum chambers situated three thousand

00:31.680 --> 00:38.880
 kilometers apart, operating in unison to measure a motion that is ten thousand times smaller than

00:38.880 --> 00:44.640
 the width of a proton. It is the smallest measurement ever attempted by science,

00:44.640 --> 00:50.240
 a measurement of gravitational waves caused by the most violent and cataclysmic events

00:50.240 --> 00:54.800
 in the universe, occurring over tens of millions of light years away.

 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast and here is my conversation with Barry Barish.

01:31.680 --> 01:42.160
 Yeah, that memory is kind of something I use to illustrate something I think is common in science,

01:42.160 --> 01:48.960
 that people that do science somehow have maintained something that kids always have.

01:49.760 --> 01:57.760
 A small kid, eight years old or so, asks you so many questions usually, typically, that you

01:57.760 --> 02:05.760
 consider them pests. You tell them to stop asking so many questions. And somehow our system manages

02:05.760 --> 02:13.680
 to kill that in most people. So in school, we make people study and do their things,

02:13.680 --> 02:21.760
 but not to pester them by asking too many questions. And I think, not just myself,

02:21.760 --> 02:28.160
 but I think it's typical of scientists like myself that have somehow escaped that. Maybe

02:28.160 --> 02:36.320
 we're still children or maybe we somehow didn't get it beaten out of us. But I teach it in college

02:36.320 --> 02:42.400
 level and it's, to me, one of the biggest deficits is the lack of curiosity, if you want,

02:42.400 --> 02:46.480
 that we've beaten out of them because I think it's an innate human quality.

02:46.480 --> 02:50.560
 Is there some advice or insights you can give to how to keep that flame of curiosity going?

02:50.560 --> 02:57.920
 I think it's a problem of both parents and that parents should realize that's a great quality we

02:57.920 --> 03:03.840
 have. That you're curious and that's good. Instead, we have expressions like curiosity

03:03.840 --> 03:14.160
 killed the cat and more. But basically, it's not thought to be a good thing. Curiosity

03:14.160 --> 03:16.960
 killed the cat means if you're too curious, you get in trouble.

03:16.960 --> 03:21.200
 I don't like cats anyway, so maybe it's a good thing.

03:21.200 --> 03:28.960
 Yeah. That, to me, needs to be solved, really, in education and in homes. It's a realization

03:28.960 --> 03:34.480
 that there's certain human qualities that we should try to build on and not destroy. One of

03:34.480 --> 03:40.160
 them is curiosity. Anyway, back to me and curiosity. I was a pest and asked a lot of

03:40.160 --> 03:46.880
 questions. My father generally could answer them at that age. And the first one I remember that he

03:46.880 --> 03:56.320
 couldn't answer was not a very original question, but basically that ice is made out of water,

03:56.320 --> 04:05.680
 and so why does it float on water? He couldn't answer it. It may not have been the first

04:05.680 --> 04:11.040
 question. It's the first one that I remember. And that was the first time that I realized that

04:11.040 --> 04:17.840
 to learn and answer your own curiosity or questions, there's various mechanisms. In

04:17.840 --> 04:23.600
 this case, it was going to the library or asking people who know more and so forth. But

04:23.600 --> 04:33.200
 eventually, you do it by what we call research. But it's driven by, hopefully, you ask good

04:33.200 --> 04:37.920
 questions. If you ask good questions and you have the mechanism to solve them, then you do what I

04:37.920 --> 04:45.040
 do in life, basically, not necessarily physics. And it's a great quality in humans, and we should

04:45.040 --> 04:52.320
 nurture it. Do you remember any other kind of in high school, maybe early college, more basic

04:52.320 --> 04:57.360
 physics ideas that sparked your curiosity or mathematics or science in general?

04:57.360 --> 05:02.960
 I wasn't really into science until I got to college, to be honest with you. But

05:02.960 --> 05:14.320
 just staying with water for a minute, I remember that I was curious what happens to water. It rains

05:14.320 --> 05:18.560
 and there's water in a wet pavement, and then the pavement dries out. What happened to this

05:19.120 --> 05:24.960
 water that came down? And I didn't know that much. And then eventually, I learned in chemistry or

05:24.960 --> 05:29.840
 something, water is made out of hydrogen and oxygen. Those are both gases. So how the heck

05:29.840 --> 05:38.560
 does it make this substance? It's liquid. Yeah, so that has to do with states of matter.

05:39.440 --> 05:46.480
 I know perhaps LIGO and the thing for which you've gotten the Nobel Prize and the things

05:46.480 --> 05:53.040
 much of your life work perhaps was a happy accident in some sense in the early days. But

05:53.040 --> 05:57.840
 is there a moment where you looked up to the stars and also, the same way you wondered about water,

05:57.840 --> 06:00.640
 wondered about some of the things that are out there in the universe?

06:01.600 --> 06:10.240
 Oh, yeah, I think everybody looks and is in awe and is curious about what it is out there. And

06:10.240 --> 06:17.280
 as I learned more, I learned, of course, that we don't know very much about what's there. And the

06:17.280 --> 06:22.720
 more we learn, the more we know we don't know. I mean, we don't know what the majority of anything

06:22.720 --> 06:27.840
 is out there. It's all what we call dark matter and dark energy. And that's one of the big

06:27.840 --> 06:33.280
 questions. When I was a student, those weren't questions. So we even know less, in a sense,

06:33.280 --> 06:43.200
 the more we look. So of course, I think that's one of the areas that almost it's universal.

06:43.200 --> 06:49.040
 People see the sky, they see the stars and they're beautiful and see it looks different

06:49.040 --> 06:52.880
 on different nights. And it's a curiosity that we all have.

06:54.160 --> 07:01.040
 What are some questions about the universe that in the same way that you felt about the ice

07:01.600 --> 07:07.040
 that today? You mentioned to me offline, you're teaching a course on the frontiers of science,

07:07.040 --> 07:12.800
 frontiers of physics. What are some questions outside the ones we'll probably talk about that

07:12.800 --> 07:23.520
 kind of, yeah, fill you with the, get your flame of curiosity up and firing up, you know,

07:23.520 --> 07:29.280
 fill you with awe? Well, first, I'm a physicist, not an astronomer. So I'm interested in the

07:29.280 --> 07:36.960
 physical phenomenon, really. So the question of dark matter and dark energy, which we probably

07:36.960 --> 07:45.360
 won't talk about, our recent last 20, 30 years, certainly dark energy. Dark energy is a complete

07:45.360 --> 07:53.280
 puzzle. It goes against what you will ask me about, which is general relativity and Einstein's

07:53.280 --> 08:00.400
 general relativity. It basically takes something that he thought was what he called a constant,

08:00.400 --> 08:09.760
 which isn't. And if that's even the right theory, and it represents most of the universe. And then

08:09.760 --> 08:14.480
 we have something called dark matter, and there's good reason to believe it might be an exotic form

08:14.480 --> 08:22.800
 of particles. And that is something I've always worked on, on particle accelerators and so forth.

08:22.800 --> 08:28.320
 And it's a big puzzle, what it is. It's a bit of a cottage industry in that there's lots and lots

08:28.320 --> 08:34.320
 of searches, but it may be a little bit like, you know, looking for a treasure under rocks or

08:34.320 --> 08:40.640
 something. You don't, it's hard to, we don't have really good guidance, except that we have very,

08:40.640 --> 08:49.520
 very good information that is pervasive and it's there. And that it's probably particles, small,

08:49.520 --> 08:57.200
 that the evidence is all of those things. But then the most logical solution doesn't seem to work,

08:57.200 --> 09:04.880
 something called supersymmetry. And do you think the answer could be something very complicated?

09:06.400 --> 09:12.560
 You know, I like to hope that, think that most things that appear complicated are actually

09:12.560 --> 09:19.440
 simple if you really understand them. I think we just don't know at the present time, and it isn't

09:19.440 --> 09:26.480
 something that affects us. It does affect, it affects how the stars go around each other and so

09:26.480 --> 09:32.960
 forth, because we detect that there's missing gravity, but it doesn't affect everyday life at

09:32.960 --> 09:42.480
 all. I tend to think and expect maybe, and that the answers will be simple. We just haven't found

09:42.480 --> 09:48.800
 it yet. Do you think those answers might change the way we see other sources of gravity, black holes,

09:49.280 --> 09:57.280
 the way we see the parts of the universe that we do study? It's conceivable. The black holes that

09:57.280 --> 10:06.000
 we've found in our experiment, we're trying now to understand the origin of those. It's conceivable,

10:06.000 --> 10:11.360
 but doesn't seem the most likely that they were primordial, that is, they were made at the

10:11.360 --> 10:15.840
 beginning. And in that sense, they could represent at least part of the dark matter.

10:16.800 --> 10:23.040
 So there can be connections, dark black holes or how many there are, how much of the mass they

10:23.040 --> 10:28.560
 encompass is still pretty primitive. We don't know. So before I talk to you more about black holes,

10:28.560 --> 10:33.760
 let me take a step back to, I actually went to high school in Chicago and would go to

10:34.720 --> 10:43.120
 take classes at Fermilab, watch the buffalo and so on. So let me ask about, you mentioned that Enrico

10:43.120 --> 10:50.080
 for me was somebody who was inspiring to you in a certain kind of way. Why is that? Can you speak

10:50.080 --> 10:59.440
 to that? Sure. He was amazing, actually. He's the last, I'll come to the reason in a minute, but

11:00.960 --> 11:11.200
 he had a big influence on me at a young age. But he was the last physicist of note that was both

11:11.200 --> 11:17.680
 an experimental physicist and a theorist at the same time. And he did two amazing things within

11:17.680 --> 11:29.360
 months in 1933. We didn't really know what the nucleus was, what radioactive decay was,

11:29.360 --> 11:42.880
 what beta decay was when electrons come out of a nucleus. And near the end of 1933, the neutron had

11:42.880 --> 11:47.680
 just been discovered. And that meant that we knew a little bit more about what the nucleus is, that

11:47.680 --> 11:54.640
 it's made out of neutrons and protons. The neutron wasn't discovered till 1932. And then once we

11:54.640 --> 12:00.160
 discovered that there was a neutron and proton and they made the nucleus and then their electrons

12:00.160 --> 12:08.240
 that go around, the basic ingredients were there. And he wrote down not only just the theory,

12:08.240 --> 12:16.560
 a theory, but a theory that lasted decades and has only been improved on of beta decay, that is,

12:16.560 --> 12:24.480
 the radiation. He did this, came out of nowhere, and it was a fantastic theory. He submitted it

12:24.480 --> 12:33.040
 to Nature magazine, which was the primary best place to publish even then. And it got rejected

12:33.040 --> 12:42.000
 as being too speculative. And so he went back to his drawing board in Rome where he was,

12:42.800 --> 12:48.720
 added some to it, made it even longer, because it's really a classic article, and then published

12:48.720 --> 12:58.720
 it in the local Italian journal for physics and the German one. At the same time, in January of

12:58.720 --> 13:07.360
 1932, Giulio and Curie, for the first time, saw artificial radioactivity. This was an important

13:07.360 --> 13:14.080
 discovery because radioactivity had been discovered much earlier. They had x rays and you

13:14.080 --> 13:19.680
 shouldn't be using them, but there was radioactivity. People knew it was useful for medicine.

13:21.440 --> 13:26.960
 But radioactive materials are hard to find, and so it wasn't prevalent. But if you could make them,

13:26.960 --> 13:35.440
 they had great use. And Giulio and Curie were able to bombard aluminum or something with alpha

13:35.440 --> 13:44.720
 particles and find that they excited something that decayed and had some half life and so forth,

13:44.720 --> 13:51.520
 meaning it was artificial version, or let's call it not a natural version, an induced version of

13:51.520 --> 14:04.800
 radioactive materials. And Fermi somehow had the insight, and I still can't see where he got it,

14:05.440 --> 14:12.400
 that the right way to follow that up was not using charged particles like alphas and so forth,

14:12.400 --> 14:19.840
 but use these newly discovered neutrons as the bombarding particle. It seemed impossible

14:19.840 --> 14:26.640
 they barely had been seen. It was hard to get very many of them. But it had the advantage that

14:26.640 --> 14:35.840
 they're not charged, so they go right into the nucleus. And that turned out to be the experimental

14:35.840 --> 14:42.880
 work that he did that won him the Nobel Prize. And it was the first step in fission, discovery

14:42.880 --> 14:50.000
 of fission. And he did this two completely different things, an experiment that was a great

14:50.000 --> 14:57.520
 idea and a tremendous implementation, because how do you get enough neutrons? And then he learned

14:58.080 --> 15:04.000
 quickly that not only do you want neutrons, but you want really slow ones. He learned that

15:04.000 --> 15:09.680
 experimentally, and he learned how to make slow ones, and then they were able to go through the

15:09.680 --> 15:16.960
 go through the periodic table and make lots of particles. He missed on fission at the moment,

15:16.960 --> 15:21.760
 but he had the basic information, and then fission follows soon after that.

15:21.760 --> 15:27.280
 Forgive me for not knowing, but is the birth of the idea of bombarding with neutrons,

15:29.200 --> 15:35.760
 is that an experimental idea? Was it born out of an experiment? Did he just observe something,

15:35.760 --> 15:40.160
 or is this an Einstein style idea where you come up from basic intuition?

15:40.160 --> 15:46.560
 I think it took a combination, because he realized that neutrons had a characteristic

15:46.560 --> 15:51.360
 that would allow them to go all the way into the nucleus when we didn't really understand

15:53.760 --> 16:00.640
 what the structure was of all this. So that took an understanding or recognition of the physics

16:00.640 --> 16:06.320
 itself of how a neutron interacts compared to, say, an alpha particle that Julio and Curie had

16:06.320 --> 16:16.640
 used. And then he had to invent a way to have enough neutrons, and he had a team of associates,

16:16.640 --> 16:20.560
 and he pulled it off quite quickly. So it was pretty astounding.

16:21.920 --> 16:28.640
 And probably, maybe you can speak to it, his ability to put together the engineering aspects

16:28.640 --> 16:33.440
 of great experiments and doing the theory, they probably fed each other. I wonder,

16:33.440 --> 16:37.760
 can you speak to why we don't see more of that? Is that just really difficult to do?

16:38.400 --> 16:45.200
 It's difficult to do. Yeah, I think in both theory and experiment in physics anyway,

16:47.920 --> 16:52.960
 it was conceivable if you had the right person to do it, and no one's been able to do it since. So

16:52.960 --> 16:56.480
 I had the dream that that was what I was going to be like, Fermi.

16:56.480 --> 17:01.680
 But you love both sides of it, the theory. Yeah, I never liked the idea that you did

17:01.680 --> 17:05.760
 experiments without really understanding the theory, or the theory should be related

17:05.760 --> 17:11.600
 very closely to experiments. And so I've always done experimental work that was closely related

17:11.600 --> 17:16.640
 to the theoretical ideas. I think I told you I'm Russian,

17:16.640 --> 17:23.440
 so I'm going to ask some romantic questions. But is it tragic to you that he's seen as the

17:23.440 --> 17:29.440
 architect of the nuclear age, that some of his creations led to potentially, some of his work

17:30.560 --> 17:37.120
 has led to potentially still the destruction of the human species, some of the most destructive

17:38.080 --> 17:47.120
 weapons? Yeah, I think even more general than him, I gave you all the virtues of curiosity a few

17:47.120 --> 17:52.320
 minutes ago. There's an interesting book called The Ratchet of Curiosity. A ratchet is something

17:52.320 --> 17:59.520
 that goes in one direction. And that is written by a guy who's probably a sociologist or philosopher

17:59.520 --> 18:06.080
 or something. And he picks on this particular problem, but other ones. And that is the danger

18:06.080 --> 18:11.040
 of knowledge, basically. You're curious, you learn something. So it's a little bit like

18:11.040 --> 18:16.320
 curiosity killed the cat. You have to be worried about whether you can handle new information that

18:16.320 --> 18:22.960
 you get. So in this case, the new information had to do with really understanding nuclear physics.

18:22.960 --> 18:30.240
 And that information, maybe we didn't have the sophistication to know how to keep it under

18:30.240 --> 18:40.640
 control. And Fermi himself was a very apolitical person. So he wasn't very driven by, or at least

18:41.200 --> 18:46.080
 he appears in all of his writing, the writing of his wife, the interactions that others had with

18:46.080 --> 18:52.000
 him. Either he avoided it all or he was pretty apolitical. I mean, he just saw the world through

18:52.000 --> 19:01.120
 kind of the lens of a scientist. But he asked if it's tragic. The bomb was tragic, certainly on

19:01.120 --> 19:08.640
 Japan. And he had a role in that. So I wouldn't want it as my legacy, for example. But brought

19:08.640 --> 19:19.200
 it to the human species that it's the ratchet of curiosity that we do stuff just to see what

19:19.200 --> 19:26.720
 happens. That curiosity, that in sort of my area of artificial intelligence, that's been a concern.

19:27.840 --> 19:33.760
 On a small scale, on a silly scale, perhaps currently, there's constantly unintended

19:33.760 --> 19:40.240
 consequences. You create a system and you put it out there and you have intuitions about how

19:40.240 --> 19:44.240
 it will work. You have hopes how it will work, but you put it out there just to see what happens.

19:44.960 --> 19:49.680
 And in most cases, because artificial intelligence is currently not super powerful,

19:49.680 --> 19:58.240
 it doesn't create a large scale negative effects, but that same curiosity as it progresses might

19:58.240 --> 20:04.720
 lead to something that destroys the human species. And the same may be true for bioengineering.

20:04.720 --> 20:15.760
 There's people that engineer viruses to protect us from viruses to see how close is this to

20:15.760 --> 20:25.520
 mutating so it can jump to humans or engineering defenses against those. And it seems exciting and

20:25.520 --> 20:30.320
 the application, the positive applications are really exciting at this time, but we don't think

20:30.320 --> 20:36.720
 about how that runs away in decades to come. Yeah. And I think it's the same idea as this

20:36.720 --> 20:46.240
 little book, The Ratchet of Science, The Ratchet of Curiosity. I mean, whether you pursue,

20:46.240 --> 20:53.280
 take curiosity and let artificial intelligence or machine learning run away with having its

20:53.280 --> 20:58.560
 solutions to whatever you want, or we do it, it's, I think, a similar consequence.

20:59.120 --> 21:07.040
 I think from what I've read about Enrico Fermi, he became a little bit cynical about the human

21:07.040 --> 21:11.200
 species towards the end of his life, both having observed what he observed.

21:12.560 --> 21:20.160
 Well, he didn't write much. I mean, he died young. He died soon after the World War. There was

21:20.160 --> 21:26.880
 already, you know, the work by Teller to develop the hydrogen bomb. And I think he was a little

21:26.880 --> 21:32.960
 cynical of that, you know, pushing it even further and rising tensions between the Soviet Union and

21:32.960 --> 21:38.320
 the U.S. and looked like an endless thing. So, but he didn't say very much, but a little bit,

21:38.320 --> 21:45.520
 as you said. Yeah, there's a few clips to sort of maybe picked on a bad mood, but in a sense that

21:45.520 --> 21:55.440
 almost like a sadness, a melancholy sadness to a hope that waned a little bit about that perhaps we

21:55.440 --> 22:02.640
 can do, like this curious species can find the way out. Well, especially, I think, people who

22:02.640 --> 22:08.800
 worked like he did at Los Alamos and spent years of their life somehow had to convince themselves

22:08.800 --> 22:18.240
 that dropping these bombs would bring lasting peace and that it didn't. Yeah. As a small,

22:18.240 --> 22:23.600
 interesting aside, it'd be interesting to hear if you have opinions on this. His name is also

22:23.600 --> 22:30.960
 attached to the Fermi Paradox, which asks if there is a, you know, it's a very interesting question,

22:30.960 --> 22:37.520
 which is if it does seem if you sort of reason basically that there should be a lot of alien

22:37.520 --> 22:46.080
 civilizations out there. If the human species, if Earth is not that unique by basic, no matter the

22:46.080 --> 22:52.400
 values you pick, it's likely that there's a lot of alien civilizations out there. And if that's the

22:52.400 --> 22:59.840
 case, why have they not at least obviously visited us or sent us loud signals that everybody can

22:59.840 --> 23:09.200
 hear? Fermi's quoted as saying, sitting down at lunch, I think it was with Teller and Herb York,

23:09.200 --> 23:15.520
 who was kind of one of the fathers of the atomic bomb. And he sat down and he said something like,

23:15.520 --> 23:25.280
 where are they? Which meant, where are these other? And then he did some numerology where he

23:25.280 --> 23:31.680
 calculated, you know, how many, what they knew about how many galaxies there are and how many

23:31.680 --> 23:37.120
 stars and how many planets then are like the Earth and blah, blah, blah. That's been done much

23:37.120 --> 23:42.240
 better by somebody named Drake. And so, people usually refer to the, I don't know whether it's

23:42.240 --> 23:47.440
 called the Drake formula or something, but it has the same conclusion. The conclusion is it would

23:47.440 --> 23:53.760
 be a miracle if there weren't other, you know, the statistics are so high that how can we be

23:53.760 --> 24:04.160
 singular and separate? So, probably there is, but there's almost certainly life somewhere. Maybe

24:04.160 --> 24:13.840
 there was even life on Mars a while back, but intelligent life, probably. So, you know, the

24:13.840 --> 24:25.440
 statistics say that communicating with us, I think that it's harder than people think. We might not

24:25.440 --> 24:34.160
 know the right way to expect the communication, but all the communication that we know about

24:34.160 --> 24:41.040
 travels at the speed of light. And we don't think anything can go faster than the speed of light.

24:41.040 --> 24:48.560
 That limits the problem quite a bit. And it makes it difficult to have any back and forth

24:48.560 --> 24:54.640
 communication. You could send signals like we try to or look for, but to have any communication,

24:54.640 --> 25:00.880
 it's pretty hard when it has to be close enough that the speed of light would mean we could

25:00.880 --> 25:06.400
 communicate with each other. And I think, and we didn't even understand that. I mean, we're

25:06.400 --> 25:11.520
 an advanced civilization, but we didn't even understand that a little more than a hundred

25:11.520 --> 25:22.160
 years ago. So, are we just not advanced enough? Maybe to know something about that's the speed

25:22.160 --> 25:26.880
 of light. Maybe there's some other way to communicate that isn't based on electromagnetism.

25:26.880 --> 25:33.760
 I don't know. Gravity seems to be also have the same speed. That was a principle that Einstein

25:33.760 --> 25:39.520
 had and something we've measured actually. So is it possible? I mean, so we'll talk about

25:39.520 --> 25:47.520
 gravitational waves and in some sense, there's a brainstorming going on, which is like,

25:48.400 --> 25:52.880
 how do we detect the signal? Like what would a signal look like and how would we detect it? And

25:52.880 --> 25:57.840
 that's true for gravitational waves. That's true for basically any physics phenomena. You have to

25:57.840 --> 26:02.080
 predict that that signal should exist. You have to have some kind of theory and model why that signal

26:02.080 --> 26:09.200
 should exist. I mean, is it possible that aliens are communicating with us via gravity? Like why

26:09.200 --> 26:18.960
 not? Well, yeah, it's true. Why not? For us, it's very hard to detect these gravitational effects.

26:18.960 --> 26:24.880
 They have to come from something pretty that has a lot of gravity like black holes, but we're

26:24.880 --> 26:35.680
 pretty primitive at this stage. There's very reputable physicists that look for a fifth force,

26:36.560 --> 26:44.320
 one that we haven't found yet. Maybe it's the key. What would a fifth force of physics look

26:44.320 --> 26:50.080
 like exactly? Well, usually they think it's probably a longer range force than we have now.

26:50.080 --> 26:56.480
 But there are reputable colleagues of mine that spend their life looking for a fifth force.

26:56.480 --> 27:02.240
 So longer range than gravity? Yeah. Super long? It doesn't fall off like one over r squared,

27:02.240 --> 27:10.480
 but maybe separately. Gravity, Newton taught us, goes like inversely one over the square of the

27:10.480 --> 27:14.400
 distance apart you are. So it falls pretty fast. That's okay. So now we have a theory of what

27:14.400 --> 27:20.640
 consciousness is. It's just the fifth force of physics. Yeah. There we go. That's a good hypothesis.

27:24.640 --> 27:31.360
 Speaking of gravity, what are gravitational waves? Let's maybe start from the basics.

27:32.720 --> 27:39.920
 We learned gravity from Newton, right? When you were young, you were told that if you jumped up,

27:39.920 --> 27:46.720
 the earth pulls you down. And when the apple falls out of the tree, the earth pulls it down.

27:47.920 --> 27:54.480
 And maybe you even asked your teacher why, but most of us accepted that. That was Newton's

27:55.440 --> 28:00.400
 picture, the apple falling out of the tree. But Newton's theory never told you why the apple

28:00.400 --> 28:07.920
 was attracted to the earth. That was a missing in Newton's theory. Newton's theory also

28:07.920 --> 28:12.720
 Newton recognized at least one of the two problems. I'll tell you one of them is there's more than

28:12.720 --> 28:20.080
 those, but one is why does the earth, what's the mechanism by which the earth pulls the apple or

28:20.080 --> 28:25.920
 holds the moon when it goes around, whatever it is. That's not explained by Newton, even though he

28:25.920 --> 28:31.040
 has the most successful theory of physics ever went 200 and some years with nobody ever seeing

28:31.040 --> 28:38.960
 a violation. But he accurately describes the movement of an object falling down to earth,

28:38.960 --> 28:44.000
 but he's not answering why that what's yeah, because it's a distance. He gives a formula,

28:45.120 --> 28:51.760
 which it's a product of the earth's mass, the apple's mass inversely proportional to the square

28:51.760 --> 28:57.280
 of the distance between and then the strength he called capital G, the strength he couldn't

28:57.280 --> 29:03.840
 determine, but it was determined 100 years later. But no one ever saw a violation of this until a

29:03.840 --> 29:08.800
 possible violation, which Einstein fixed, which was very small that has to do with

29:08.800 --> 29:16.400
 mercury going around the sun, the orbit being slightly wrong if you calculate it by Newton's

29:16.400 --> 29:25.280
 theory. But so like most theories then in physics, you can have a wonderful one like Newton's theory.

29:25.280 --> 29:34.000
 It isn't wrong. But you have to have an improvement on it to answer things that it can't answer. And

29:34.000 --> 29:41.040
 in this case, Einstein's theory is the next step. We don't know if it's anything like a final theory

29:41.040 --> 29:51.440
 or even the only way to formulate it either. But he formulated this theory, which he released in 1915.

29:51.440 --> 29:56.960
 He took 10 years to develop it, even though in 1905, he solved three or four of the most important

29:56.960 --> 30:01.600
 problems in physics in a matter of months. And then he spent 10 years on this problem before he

30:02.480 --> 30:06.080
 let it out. And this is called general relativity. It's a new theory of gravity.

30:07.120 --> 30:18.720
 1915. In 1916, Einstein wrote a little paper where he did not do some fancy derivation.

30:18.720 --> 30:30.000
 Instead, he did what I would call he used his intuition, which he was very good at too. And that

30:30.000 --> 30:36.400
 is he noticed that if he wrote the formulas for general relativity in a particular way,

30:37.200 --> 30:40.800
 they looked a lot like the formulas for electricity and magnetism.

30:40.800 --> 30:46.800
 Being Einstein, he then took the leap that electricity and magnetism, we discovered only

30:46.800 --> 30:54.560
 20 years before that in the 1880s, have waves. Of course, that's light and electromagnetic waves,

30:54.560 --> 31:01.440
 radio waves, everything else. So he said, if the formulas look similar, then gravity probably has

31:01.440 --> 31:10.400
 waves too. That's such a big leap, by the way. I mean, maybe you could go back to the 1880s,

31:10.400 --> 31:15.120
 maybe you can correct me, but that just seems like a heck of a leap.

31:15.120 --> 31:21.280
 Yeah. And it was considered to be a heck of a leap. So first that paper was, except for this

31:22.080 --> 31:30.320
 intuition, was poorly written, had a serious mistake. It had a factor of two wrong in the

31:30.320 --> 31:37.200
 strength of gravity, which meant if we use those formulas, we would... And two years later,

31:37.200 --> 31:43.680
 he wrote a second paper. And in that paper, it turns out to be important for us because in that

31:43.680 --> 31:50.480
 paper, he not only fixed his factor of two mistake, which he never admitted, he just wrote it,

31:50.480 --> 31:58.640
 fixed it like he always did. And then he told us how you make gravitational waves, what makes

31:58.640 --> 32:05.200
 gravitational waves. And you might recall in electromagnetism, we make electromagnetic waves

32:05.200 --> 32:10.160
 in a simple way. You take a plus charge and minus charge, you oscillate like this, and that makes

32:10.160 --> 32:16.320
 the electromagnetic waves. And a physicist named Hertz made a receiver that could detect the waves

32:16.320 --> 32:22.160
 and put it in the next room. He saw them and moved forward and backward and saw that it was wave like.

32:22.160 --> 32:30.400
 So Einstein said, it won't be a dipole like that, it'll be a four pole thing. And that's what it's

32:30.400 --> 32:36.880
 called, it's called a quadrupole moment that gives the gravitational wave. So that again, by insight,

32:36.880 --> 32:43.360
 not by derivation. That set the table for what you needed to do to do it. At the same time,

32:43.360 --> 32:49.520
 in the same year, Schwarzschild, not Einstein, said there were things called black holes. So

32:49.520 --> 32:56.640
 it's interesting that that came the same. So what year was that? 1915. It was in parallel...

32:56.640 --> 33:01.920
 Well, I should probably know this, but did Einstein not have an intuition that there

33:01.920 --> 33:06.400
 should be such things as black holes? That came from Schwarzschild. Oh, interesting.

33:07.200 --> 33:14.400
 Yeah. So Schwarzschild, who was a German theoretical physicist, he got killed in the war,

33:14.400 --> 33:21.520
 I think, in the First World War, two years later or so. He's the one that proposed black holes,

33:21.520 --> 33:27.120
 that there were black holes. That feels like a natural conclusion of general relativity, no? Or

33:27.120 --> 33:33.840
 is that not? Well, it may seem like it, but I don't know about a natural conclusion. It's a result

33:34.560 --> 33:39.600
 of curved space time though. Right. But it's such a weird result that you might have to...

33:40.560 --> 33:48.960
 It's a special... Yeah, it's a special case. Yeah. So I don't know. Anyway, Einstein then,

33:48.960 --> 33:54.000
 an interesting part of the story is that Einstein then left the problem. Most physicists,

33:54.000 --> 34:01.120
 because it really wasn't derived, he just made this, didn't pick up on it or general relativity

34:01.120 --> 34:10.080
 much because quantum mechanics became the thing in physics. And Einstein only picked up this

34:10.080 --> 34:18.000
 problem again after he immigrated to the US. So he came to the US in 1932. And I think in 1934 or

34:18.000 --> 34:24.400
 1935, he was working with another physicist called Rosen, who he did several important works with,

34:24.400 --> 34:32.880
 and they revisited the question. And they had a problem that most of us as students always had,

34:32.880 --> 34:37.680
 that study general relativity. General relativity is really hard because it's four dimensional

34:37.680 --> 34:42.800
 instead of three dimensional. And if you don't set it up right, you get infinities,

34:42.800 --> 34:49.520
 which don't belong there. We call them coordinate singularities as a name. But if you get these

34:49.520 --> 34:56.880
 infinities, you don't get the answers you want. And he was trying to derive now general relativity

34:57.440 --> 35:03.280
 from general relativity, gravitational waves. And in doing it, he kept getting these infinities.

35:04.240 --> 35:10.880
 And so he wrote a paper with Rosen that he submitted to our most important journal,

35:10.880 --> 35:17.840
 Physical Review Letters. And that when it was submitted to Physical Review Letters,

35:17.840 --> 35:24.400
 it was entitled, Do Gravitational Waves Exist? A very funny title to write 20 years after he

35:24.400 --> 35:32.240
 proposed they exist. But it's because he had found these singularities, these infinities. And so

35:32.240 --> 35:43.440
 the editor at that time, and the part of it that I don't know, is peer review. We live and die by

35:43.440 --> 35:48.560
 peer review as scientists send our stuff out. We don't know when peer review actually started

35:49.520 --> 35:55.520
 or what peer review Einstein ever experienced before this time. But the editor of Physical

35:55.520 --> 36:02.000
 Review sent this out for review. He had a choice. He could take any article and just accept it.

36:02.000 --> 36:07.760
 He could reject it, or he could send it for review. I believe the editors used to have much

36:07.760 --> 36:13.360
 more power. Yeah, yeah. And he was a young man. His name was Tate. And he ended up being editor

36:13.360 --> 36:22.320
 for years. So he sent this for review to a theoretical physicist named Robertson, who was

36:22.320 --> 36:27.840
 also in this field of general relativity, who happened to be on sabbatical at that moment at

36:27.840 --> 36:37.280
 Caltech. Otherwise, his institution was Princeton, where Einstein was. And he saw that the way they

36:37.280 --> 36:42.320
 set up the problem, the infinities were like I make it as a student, because if you don't

36:42.320 --> 36:48.320
 set it up right in general relativity, you get these infinities. And so he reviewed the article

36:48.320 --> 36:54.640
 and gave an illustration that if they set it up in what are called cylindrical coordinates, these

36:54.640 --> 37:03.280
 infinities went away. The editor of Physical Review was obviously intimidated by Einstein.

37:03.280 --> 37:08.800
 He wrote this really not a letter back like I would get saying, you're screwed up in your paper

37:08.800 --> 37:17.840
 instead. It was kind of, what do you think of the comments of our referee? Einstein wrote back,

37:17.840 --> 37:24.640
 and it's a well documented letter, wrote back a letter to Physical Review saying, I didn't send

37:24.640 --> 37:31.600
 you the paper to send it to one of your so called experts. I sent it to you to publish. I withdraw

37:31.600 --> 37:42.000
 the paper. And he never published again in that journal. That was 1936. Instead, he rewrote it

37:42.000 --> 37:49.920
 with the fixes that were made, changed the title and published it in what was called the Franklin

37:49.920 --> 37:56.960
 Review, which is the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, which is Benjamin Franklin

37:56.960 --> 38:01.920
 Institute, which doesn't have a journal now, but did at that time. So the article is published.

38:01.920 --> 38:08.080
 It's the last time he ever wrote about it. It remained controversial. So it wasn't until

38:08.080 --> 38:19.760
 close to 1960, 1958, where there was a conference that brought together the experts in general

38:19.760 --> 38:29.360
 relativity to try to sort out whether it was true that there were gravitational waves or not.

38:29.360 --> 38:40.240
 And there was a very nice derivation by a British theorist from the heart of the theory that gets

38:40.240 --> 38:46.160
 gravitational waves. And that was number one. The second thing that happened at that meeting is

38:46.160 --> 38:53.200
 Richard Feynman was there. And Feynman said, well, if there's typical Feynman, if there's

38:53.200 --> 38:58.320
 gravitational waves, they need to be able to do something, otherwise they don't exist. So they

38:58.320 --> 39:05.200
 have to be able to transfer energy. So he made an idea of a gedankenexperiment that is just a bar

39:05.920 --> 39:11.120
 with a couple of rings on it. And then if a gravitational wave goes through, it distorts the

39:11.120 --> 39:19.440
 bar and that creates friction on these little rings and that's heat and that's energy. So that

39:19.440 --> 39:24.960
 meant... Is that a good idea? That sounds like a good idea. Yeah. It means that he showed that

39:24.960 --> 39:31.440
 that with the distortion of space time, you could transfer energy just by this little idea.

39:31.440 --> 39:39.360
 And it was shown theoretically. So at that point, it was believed theoretically then

39:39.360 --> 39:45.440
 by people that gravitational waves should exist. No, we should be able to detect them.

39:45.440 --> 39:49.200
 We should be able to detect them, except that they're very, very small.

39:49.200 --> 39:54.320
 And so what kind of, there's a bunch of questions here, but what kind of events

39:55.280 --> 40:01.200
 would generate gravitational waves? You have to have this, what I call quadrupole moment.

40:01.200 --> 40:08.400
 That comes about if I have, for example, two objects that go around each other like this,

40:08.400 --> 40:14.960
 like the earth around the sun or the moon around the earth, or in our case, it turns out to be two

40:14.960 --> 40:19.680
 black holes going around each other like this. So how's that different than basic oscillation

40:19.680 --> 40:24.080
 back and forth? Is it just more common in nature to have... Oscillation is a dipole moment. So it

40:24.080 --> 40:27.600
 has to be in three dimensional space kind of oscillation. So you have to have something

40:27.600 --> 40:32.160
 that's three dimensional that'll give what I called a quadrupole moment. That's just built

40:32.160 --> 40:38.400
 into this. And luckily in nature you have stuff... And luckily things exist. And it is luckily

40:38.400 --> 40:43.120
 because the effect is so small that you could say, look, I could take a barbell

40:43.120 --> 40:50.640
 and spin it, right? And detect the gravitational waves. But unfortunately, no matter how much I

40:50.640 --> 40:56.560
 spin it, how fast I spin it, so I know how to make gravitational waves, but they're so weak,

40:56.560 --> 41:01.520
 I can't detect them. So we have to take something that's stronger than I can make. Otherwise we

41:01.520 --> 41:07.040
 would do what Hertz did for electromagnetic waves. Go in our lab, take a barbell, put it on

41:07.040 --> 41:13.120
 something, spin it. Can I ask a dumb question? So a single object that's weirdly shaped,

41:13.120 --> 41:20.480
 does that generate gravitational waves? So if it's rotating? Sure. But it's just a much weaker signal.

41:20.480 --> 41:25.680
 It's weaker. Well, we didn't know what the strongest signal would be that we would see.

41:26.880 --> 41:31.040
 We targeted seeing something called neutron stars actually, because black holes we don't

41:31.040 --> 41:35.680
 know very much about. It turned out we were a little bit lucky. There was a stronger source,

41:35.680 --> 41:43.680
 which was the black holes. Well, another ridiculous question. So you say waves. What does a wave mean?

41:43.680 --> 41:52.320
 Like the most ridiculous version of that question is, what does it feel like to ride a wave as you

41:52.320 --> 42:00.320
 get closer to the source? Or experience it? Well, if you experience a wave, imagine that this is

42:00.320 --> 42:06.320
 what happens to you. I don't know what you mean about getting close. It comes to you. So it's like

42:06.320 --> 42:12.400
 this light wave or something that comes through you. So when a light hits you, it makes your eyes

42:12.400 --> 42:20.560
 detect it. I flashed it. What does this do? It's like going to the amusement park, and they have

42:20.560 --> 42:25.040
 these mirrors. You look in this mirror and you look short and fat, and the one next to you makes

42:25.040 --> 42:31.840
 you tall and thin. Imagine that you went back and forth between those two mirrors once a second.

42:32.560 --> 42:38.480
 That would be a gravitational wave with a period of once a second. If you did it 60 times a second,

42:38.480 --> 42:43.520
 go back and forth. And then that's all that happens. It makes you taller and shorter and

42:43.520 --> 42:50.320
 fatter back and forth as it goes through you at the frequency of the gravitational wave. So the

42:50.320 --> 42:57.520
 frequencies that we detect are higher than one a second, but that's the idea. And the amount is

42:57.520 --> 43:06.080
 small. Amount is small, but if you're closer to the source of the wave, is it the same amount?

43:07.200 --> 43:14.880
 Yeah, it doesn't dissipate. It doesn't dissipate. Okay, so it's not that fun of an amusement ride.

43:14.880 --> 43:22.400
 Well, it does dissipate, but it's proportional to the distance.

43:22.400 --> 43:24.720
 Right. It's not a big power.

43:24.720 --> 43:31.200
 Right. Gotcha. But it would be a fun ride if you get a little bit closer or a lot closer.

43:31.840 --> 43:36.320
 I mean, I wonder what the... Okay, this is a ridiculous question, but I have you here.

43:36.320 --> 43:44.640
 I mean, the getting fatter and taller, I mean, that experience, for some reason,

43:44.640 --> 43:51.520
 that's mind blowing to me because it brings the distortion of space time to you. I mean,

43:51.520 --> 43:56.000
 space time is being morphed, right? Like this is a wave.

43:56.000 --> 43:56.400
 That's right.

43:57.200 --> 43:59.760
 That's so weird.

43:59.760 --> 44:01.200
 And we're in space, so we're affected by it.

44:01.200 --> 44:03.520
 Yeah, we're in space and now it's moving.

44:03.520 --> 44:06.960
 It's moving. I don't know what to do with it. I mean, does it... Okay.

44:08.480 --> 44:12.560
 How much do you think about the philosophical implications of

44:13.440 --> 44:19.200
 general relativity? Like that we're in space time and it can be bent by gravity.

44:21.280 --> 44:27.280
 Like, is that just what it is? Are we supposed to be okay with this? Because like Newton,

44:27.840 --> 44:31.120
 even Newton is a little weird, right? But that at least like makes sense.

44:31.120 --> 44:37.680
 That's our physical world. When an apple falls, it makes sense. But the fact that

44:37.680 --> 44:47.840
 entirety of the space time we're in can bend, that's really mind blowing.

44:47.840 --> 44:49.360
 Let me make another analogy.

44:49.360 --> 44:50.880
 This is a therapy session for me at this point.

44:50.880 --> 44:52.880
 Yeah, right. Another analogy.

44:52.880 --> 44:53.520
 Thank you.

44:53.520 --> 44:56.000
 So imagine you have a trampoline.

44:56.000 --> 44:56.240
 Yes.

44:56.240 --> 45:00.800
 Okay. What happens if you put a marble on a trampoline? It doesn't do anything, right?

45:02.240 --> 45:04.720
 No. Just a little bit, but not much.

45:04.720 --> 45:07.600
 Yeah. I mean, just if I drop it, it's not going to go anywhere.

45:08.320 --> 45:11.120
 Now imagine I put a bowling ball at the center of the trampoline.

45:12.640 --> 45:16.640
 Now I come up to the trampoline and I put a marble on, what happens?

45:18.000 --> 45:20.560
 It'll roll towards the bowling ball.

45:20.560 --> 45:28.240
 Okay. All right. So what's happened is the presence of this massive object distorted the space

45:28.880 --> 45:35.040
 that the trampoline did. This is the same thing that happens to the presence of the earth,

45:36.080 --> 45:40.160
 the earth and the apple. The presence of the earth affects the space around it,

45:40.160 --> 45:43.840
 just like the bowling ball on the trampoline.

45:43.840 --> 45:47.280
 Yeah. This doesn't make me feel better. I'm referring from the perspective of an

45:47.280 --> 45:55.760
 ant walking around on that trampoline. Then some guy just dropped a ball and then not only dropped

45:55.760 --> 46:02.640
 the ball, right? It's not just dropping a bowling ball. It's making the ball go up and down or doing

46:02.640 --> 46:08.480
 some kind of oscillation thing where it's like waves. And that's so fundamentally different from

46:08.480 --> 46:13.360
 the experience on being on flatland and walking around and just finding delicious, sweet things

46:13.360 --> 46:20.000
 as ant does. And it just feels like to me from a human experience perspective, completely,

46:20.000 --> 46:21.680
 it's humbling. It's truly humbling.

46:22.800 --> 46:25.600
 It's humbling, but we see that kind of phenomenon all the time.

46:26.800 --> 46:32.240
 Let me give you another example. Imagine that you walk up to a still pond.

46:32.880 --> 46:33.440
 Yes.

46:33.440 --> 46:41.360
 Okay. Now I throw, you throw a rock in it, what happens? The rock goes in, sinks to the bottom,

46:41.360 --> 46:48.400
 fine. And these little ripples go out and they travel out. That's exactly what happens. I mean,

46:48.400 --> 46:55.440
 there's a disturbance, which is these, say, the bowling ball or black holes. And then the ripples

46:55.440 --> 47:01.520
 that go out in the water, they're not, they don't have any, they don't have the rock, any part,

47:01.520 --> 47:02.480
 pieces of the rock.

47:02.480 --> 47:10.000
 See, the thing is, I guess what's not disturbing about that is it's a, I mean, I guess a flat

47:10.000 --> 47:16.640
 two dimensional surface that's being disturbed. Like for a three dimensional surface, a three

47:16.640 --> 47:19.840
 dimensional space to be disturbed feels weird.

47:19.840 --> 47:23.120
 It's even worse. It's four dimensional because it's space and time.

47:23.120 --> 47:23.680
 Time, yeah.

47:24.880 --> 47:28.080
 So that's why you need Einstein is to make it four dimensional.

47:28.080 --> 47:29.440
 To make it okay?

47:29.440 --> 47:30.640
 No, to make it.

47:30.640 --> 47:31.680
 To make it four dimensional?

47:31.680 --> 47:32.320
 Yeah.

47:32.320 --> 47:39.120
 Yeah, to take the same phenomenon and look at it in all of space and time. Anyway,

47:39.120 --> 47:45.920
 luckily for you and I and all of us, the amount of distortion is incredibly small.

47:47.600 --> 47:54.240
 So it turns out that if you think of space itself, now this is going to blow your mind too,

47:54.240 --> 48:00.000
 if you think of space as being like a material, like this table, it's very stiff. You know,

48:00.000 --> 48:06.480
 we have materials that are very pliable, materials that are very stiff. So space itself is very stiff.

48:06.480 --> 48:09.520
 So when gravitational waves come through it, luckily for us,

48:09.520 --> 48:14.480
 it doesn't distort it so much that it affects our ordinary life very much.

48:16.240 --> 48:19.920
 No, I mean, that's great. That's great. I thought there was something bad coming.

48:19.920 --> 48:24.160
 No, this is great. That's great news. So I mean, that, I mean, perhaps we evolved

48:24.160 --> 48:32.800
 as life on Earth to be such that for us, this particular set of effects of gravitational waves

48:32.800 --> 48:36.160
 is not that significant. Maybe that's why.

48:36.160 --> 48:41.760
 It is. You probably used this effect today or yesterday.

48:41.760 --> 48:42.320
 Did what?

48:42.960 --> 48:45.440
 So it's pervasive. Well, because...

48:45.440 --> 48:49.440
 You mean gravity or the way, or external? Because I only...

48:49.440 --> 48:50.720
 Curvature of space and time.

48:50.720 --> 48:56.000
 Curvature of space. How? I only care, a person is a human, right? The gravity of Earth.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
 But you use it every day, almost.

48:59.360 --> 49:00.240
 Oh, it's curving.

49:00.240 --> 49:00.720
 Uh huh.

49:00.720 --> 49:01.760
 No, no, no.

49:01.760 --> 49:06.560
 No, no, no. It's in this thing. Every time it tells you where you are,

49:07.840 --> 49:11.520
 how does it tell you where you are? It tells you where you are because we have

49:11.520 --> 49:18.240
 24 satellites or some number that are going around in space and it asks how long it takes

49:18.240 --> 49:24.320
 the beam to go to the satellite and come back, the signal, to different ones.

49:24.320 --> 49:28.560
 And then it triangulates and tells you where you are. And then if you go down the road,

49:28.560 --> 49:32.880
 it tells you where you are. Do you know that if you did that with the satellites and you

49:32.880 --> 49:34.800
 didn't use Einstein's equations?

49:34.800 --> 49:35.280
 Oh no.

49:36.560 --> 49:42.400
 You won't get the right answer. That's right. And in fact, if you take a road that's, say,

49:42.400 --> 49:46.640
 10 meters wide, I've done these numbers, and you ask how long you'd stay on the road if

49:46.640 --> 49:52.160
 you didn't make the correction for general relativity, this thing you're poo pooing,

49:52.160 --> 49:56.400
 because you're using every day, you'd go off the road in about a minute.

49:56.400 --> 49:57.200
 Well, actually, that might be my problem.

49:57.200 --> 50:00.480
 So you use it. So don't poo poo it.

50:00.480 --> 50:04.320
 Well, I think I'm using an Android, so maybe, and the GPS doesn't work that well, so maybe

50:04.320 --> 50:11.280
 I'm using Newton's physics. So I need to upgrade to general relativity. So gravitational waves

50:11.280 --> 50:16.720
 and Einstein had, wait, Feynman really does have a part in the story?

50:16.720 --> 50:17.280
 Yeah.

50:17.280 --> 50:22.080
 Was that one of the first kind of experimental proposed to detect gravitational waves?

50:22.080 --> 50:25.360
 Well, he did what we call a Godonkin experiment. That's a thought experiment.

50:25.360 --> 50:25.680
 Yes.

50:25.680 --> 50:31.760
 Okay. Not a real experiment. But then after that, then people believe gravitational waves

50:31.760 --> 50:37.280
 must exist. You can kind of calculate how big they are. They're tiny. And so people

50:37.280 --> 50:43.520
 started searching. The first idea that was used was Feynman's idea, and the very end of it.

50:44.080 --> 50:51.360
 And it was to take a great big, huge bar of aluminum and then put around, and it's made

50:51.360 --> 50:57.360
 like a cylinder, and then put around it some very, very sensitive detectors so that if a

50:57.360 --> 51:03.760
 gravitational wave happened to go through it, it would go, and you'd detect this extra strain

51:03.760 --> 51:10.080
 that was there. And that was this method that was used until we came along. It wasn't a very

51:10.080 --> 51:11.120
 good method to use.

51:12.160 --> 51:16.960
 And what was the, so we're talking about a pretty weak signal here.

51:16.960 --> 51:19.280
 Yeah, that's why that method didn't work.

51:19.280 --> 51:25.200
 So what, can you tell the story of figuring out what kind of method would be able to detect

51:26.480 --> 51:28.640
 this very weak signal of gravitational waves?

51:30.080 --> 51:38.320
 So remembering what happens when you go to the amusement park, that it's going to do something

51:38.320 --> 51:44.400
 like stretch this way and squash that way, squash this way and stretch this way. We do

51:44.400 --> 51:49.600
 have an instrument that can detect that kind of thing. It's called an interferometer.

51:50.880 --> 51:58.720
 And what it does is it just basically takes, usually light, and the two directions that

51:58.720 --> 52:03.680
 we're talking about, you send light down one direction and the perpendicular direction.

52:04.240 --> 52:10.720
 And if nothing changes, it takes the same, and the arms are the same length, it just

52:10.720 --> 52:16.080
 goes down, bounces back. And if you invert one compared to the other, they cancel so

52:16.080 --> 52:17.040
 that nothing happens.

52:17.680 --> 52:24.080
 But if it's like the amusement park and one of the arms got shorter and fatter, so it

52:24.080 --> 52:30.480
 took longer to go horizontally than it did to go vertically, then when the light comes

52:30.480 --> 52:37.280
 back, that comes back somewhat out of time. And that basically is the scheme. The only

52:37.280 --> 52:44.880
 problem is that that's not done very accurately in general, and we had to do it extremely

52:44.880 --> 52:45.840
 accurately.

52:45.840 --> 52:52.160
 So what's the difficulty of doing so accurately?

52:52.160 --> 53:00.960
 Okay. So the measurement that we have to do is a distortion in time. How big is it? It's

53:00.960 --> 53:07.840
 a distortion that's one part in 10 to the 21. That's 21 zeros and a one. Okay.

53:08.720 --> 53:11.440
 So this is like a delay in the thing coming back?

53:13.520 --> 53:17.920
 One of them coming back after the other one, but the difference is just one part in 10

53:17.920 --> 53:26.560
 to the 21. So for that reason, we make it big, let the arms be long. Okay, so one part

53:26.560 --> 53:33.040
 in 10 to the 21. In our case, it's kilometers long. So we have an instrument that's kilometers

53:33.040 --> 53:34.880
 in one direction, kilometers in the other.

53:34.880 --> 53:37.360
 How many kilometers are we talking about? Four kilometers.

53:37.360 --> 53:44.640
 Four kilometers in each direction. If you take then one part in 10 to the 21, we're

53:44.640 --> 53:51.040
 talking about measuring something to 10 to the minus 18 meters.

53:54.720 --> 53:55.040
 Okay.

53:55.040 --> 54:01.520
 Now, to tell you how small that is, the proton thing we're made of, which you can't go

54:01.520 --> 54:07.200
 and grab so easily, is 10 to the minus 15 meters. So this is one one thousandth the

54:07.200 --> 54:13.920
 size of a proton. That's the size of the effect. Einstein himself didn't think this

54:13.920 --> 54:19.760
 could be measured. We've never seen, actually, he said that. But that's because he didn't

54:19.760 --> 54:25.520
 anticipate modern lasers and techniques that we developed.

54:27.200 --> 54:33.520
 Okay. So maybe can you tell me a little bit what you're referring to as LIGO, the Laser

54:34.240 --> 54:40.560
 Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory. What is LIGO? Can you just elaborate kind

54:40.560 --> 54:44.160
 of the big picture view here before I ask you specific questions about it?

54:44.160 --> 54:54.400
 Yeah. So in the same idea that I just said, we have two long vacuum pipes, four kilometers

54:54.400 --> 55:03.200
 long. We start with a laser beam and we divide the beam going down the two arms. And we have

55:03.200 --> 55:09.920
 a mirror at the other end, reflects it back. It's more subtle, but we bring it back. If

55:09.920 --> 55:14.800
 there's no distortion in space time and the lengths are exactly the same, which we calibrate

55:14.800 --> 55:20.720
 them to be, then when it comes back, if we just invert one signal compared to the other,

55:20.720 --> 55:26.800
 they'll just cancel. So we see nothing. Okay. But if one arm got a little bit longer than

55:26.800 --> 55:31.760
 the other, then they don't come back at exactly the same time. They don't exactly cancel.

55:31.760 --> 55:42.320
 That's what we measure. So to give a number to it, we have the change of length to be

55:42.320 --> 55:48.480
 able to do this 10 to the minus 18 meters to one part in 10 to the 12th. And that was

55:48.480 --> 55:55.920
 the big experimental challenge that required a lot of innovation to be able to do.

55:55.920 --> 56:02.560
 You gave a lot of credit to, I think, Caltech and MIT for some of the technical developments

56:02.560 --> 56:10.240
 within this project. Is there some interesting things you can speak to at the low level of

56:10.240 --> 56:17.600
 some cool stuff that had to be solved? I'm a software engineer, so I have so much more

56:17.600 --> 56:25.440
 respect for everything done here than anything I've ever done. So I'll give you an example

56:25.440 --> 56:35.840
 of doing mechanical engineering at a better, basically mechanical engineering and geology

56:35.840 --> 56:42.480
 and maybe at a level. So what's the problem? The problem is the following, that I've given

56:42.480 --> 56:47.920
 you this picture of an instrument that by some magic, I can make good enough to measure

56:47.920 --> 56:54.000
 this very short distance. But then I put it down here, it won't work. And the reason it

56:54.000 --> 56:59.600
 doesn't work is that the Earth itself is moving all over the place all the time. You don't

56:59.600 --> 57:05.680
 realize it, it seems pretty good to you, but it's moving all the time. So somehow it's

57:05.680 --> 57:10.320
 moving so much that we can't deal with it. We happen to be trying to do the experiment

57:10.320 --> 57:16.160
 here on Earth, but we can't deal with it. So we have to make the instrument isolated

57:16.160 --> 57:23.040
 from the Earth at the frequencies we're at. We've got to float it. That's an engineering

57:23.040 --> 57:24.720
 problem, not a physics problem.

57:24.720 --> 57:32.160
 So we're having a conversation on a podcast right now, and people who record music work

57:32.160 --> 57:38.080
 with this, how to create an isolated room. And they usually build a room within a room,

57:39.040 --> 57:43.200
 but that's still not isolated. In fact, they say it's impossible to truly isolate from

57:43.200 --> 57:51.760
 sound, from noise and stuff like that. But that's like one step of millions that you

57:51.760 --> 57:56.800
 took is building a room inside a room, because you basically have to isolate all.

57:56.800 --> 58:02.000
 No, this is actually an easier problem. You just have to do it really well. So making

58:02.000 --> 58:07.920
 a clean room is really a tough problem because you have to put a room inside a room. This

58:07.920 --> 58:14.080
 is really simple engineering or physics. Okay, so what do you have to do? How do you isolate

58:14.080 --> 58:21.600
 yourself from the Earth? First, we work at, we're not looking at all frequencies for

58:21.600 --> 58:26.560
 gravitational waves. We're looking at particular frequencies that you can deal with here on

58:26.560 --> 58:31.760
 Earth. So what are frequencies would those be? You were just talking about frequencies.

58:34.000 --> 58:40.800
 We know by evolution, our bodies know, it's the audio band. Okay, the reason our ears

58:40.800 --> 58:45.040
 work where they work is that's where the Earth isn't going, making too much noise.

58:45.040 --> 58:48.720
 Okay, so the reason our ears work the way they work is because this is where it's quiet.

58:48.720 --> 58:59.520
 That's right. So if you go to one Hertz instead of 10 Hertz, the Earth is really moving around.

58:59.520 --> 59:06.320
 So somehow we live in what we call the audio band. It's tens of Hertz to thousands of Hertz.

59:06.320 --> 59:14.000
 That's where we live, okay? If we're going to do an experiment on the Earth, it's the

59:14.000 --> 59:18.000
 same frequency. That's where the Earth is the quietest. So we have to work in that frequency.

59:18.000 --> 59:25.440
 So we're not looking at all frequencies, okay? So the solution for the shaking of the Earth

59:25.440 --> 59:33.840
 to get rid of it is pretty mundane if we do the same thing that you do to make your car drive

59:33.840 --> 59:39.760
 smoothly down the road. So what happens when your car goes over a bump? Early cars did that,

59:39.760 --> 59:41.280
 they bounced. Right.

59:41.280 --> 59:47.120
 Okay, but you don't feel that in your car. So what happened to that energy? You can't just

59:47.120 --> 59:53.040
 disappear energy. So we have these things called shock absorbers in the car. What they do is they

59:53.840 --> 59:58.880
 take the thing that went like that, and they basically can't get rid of the energy, but they

59:58.880 --> 1:00:08.560
 move it to very, very low frequency. So what you feel isn't, you feel it go smoothly, okay? All

1:00:08.560 --> 1:00:18.080
 right. So we also work at this frequency. So we basically, why don't we have to do anything other

1:00:18.080 --> 1:00:26.400
 than shock absorbers? So we made the world's fanciest shock absorbers, okay? Not just like in

1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:30.480
 your car where there's one layer of them. They're just the right squishiness and so forth. They're

1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:35.760
 better than what's in the cars. And we have four layers of it. So whatever shakes and gets through

1:00:35.760 --> 1:00:40.880
 the first layer, we treat it in a second, third, fourth layer. So it's a mechanical engineering

1:00:40.880 --> 1:00:46.640
 problem. Yeah, that's what I said. So it's not, there's no weird tricks to it, like a chemistry

1:00:46.640 --> 1:00:51.840
 type thing. No, no. Just, well, the right squishiness, you need the right material inside.

1:00:51.840 --> 1:00:58.720
 And ours look like little springs, but they're. Springs? They're springs? So like legitimately,

1:00:58.720 --> 1:01:06.640
 like shock absorbers. Yeah. What? Okay. Okay. And this is now experimental physics at the,

1:01:06.640 --> 1:01:11.120
 at its limit. Okay. So you do this and we make the world's fanciest shock absorbers,

1:01:11.120 --> 1:01:16.800
 just mechanical engineering. Just mechanical engineering, this is hilarious. But we didn't,

1:01:16.800 --> 1:01:25.360
 we weren't good enough to discover gravitational waves. So we did another, we added another

1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:33.920
 feature and it's something else that you're aware of, probably have one. And that is to get rid of

1:01:33.920 --> 1:01:40.160
 noise. You've probably noise, which is, you don't like. And that's the same principle that's in

1:01:40.160 --> 1:01:48.240
 these little Bose earphones. Noise canceling? Noise canceling. So how do they work? They

1:01:48.240 --> 1:01:53.600
 basically, you go on an airplane and they sense the ambient noise from the engines

1:01:53.600 --> 1:01:59.360
 and cancel it. Cause it's just the same over and over again. They cancel it. And when the stewardess

1:01:59.360 --> 1:02:03.760
 comes and asks you whether you want coffee or tea or a drink or something, you hear, you're fine

1:02:03.760 --> 1:02:09.040
 because she's not ambient. She's the signal. So. Are we talking about active canceling? Like where

1:02:09.040 --> 1:02:16.160
 are the. Active canceling. So. This is, okay. So another. Don't tell me you have active canceling

1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:22.480
 on this. Yeah. Besides the shock absorbers. So we had this, so inside this array of shock absorbers.

1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:29.600
 Yeah. We, you asked for some interesting. This is awesome. So inside this, it's harder than the,

1:02:29.600 --> 1:02:34.880
 the earphone problem, but it's just engineering. We have to see measure, not just that the

1:02:36.320 --> 1:02:42.880
 engine still made noise, but the earth is shaking. It's moving in some direction. So we have to

1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:48.240
 actually tell not only that there's noise and cancel it, but what direction it's from. So we

1:02:48.240 --> 1:02:57.840
 put this array of seismometers inside this array of shock absorbers and measure the residual motion

1:02:58.320 --> 1:03:05.040
 and its direction. And we put little actuators that push back against it and cancel it.

1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:11.920
 This is awesome. So you have the actuators and you have the thing that is sensing the,

1:03:11.920 --> 1:03:16.080
 the vibrations and then you have the actual actuators that adjust for that and do so in

1:03:16.080 --> 1:03:22.080
 perfect synchrony. Yeah. What if it all works right. And so how much do we reduce the shaking

1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:31.440
 of the earth? I mean, one part in 10 to the 12th. One part in 10. So what gets through us is one

1:03:31.440 --> 1:03:39.040
 part in 10 to the 12th. That's pretty big reduction. You don't need that in your car,

1:03:39.040 --> 1:03:43.200
 but that's what we do. And so that's how isolated we are from the earth. And that was the biggest,

1:03:43.200 --> 1:03:49.040
 and that was the biggest, I'd say technical problem outside of the physics instrument,

1:03:49.040 --> 1:03:54.480
 the interferometer. Can I ask you a weird question here? You make it very poetically

1:03:54.480 --> 1:04:00.000
 and humorously is saying it's just a mechanical engineering problem, but is this one of the

1:04:01.360 --> 1:04:09.760
 biggest precision mechanical engineering efforts ever? I mean, this seems exceptionally difficult.

1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:16.960
 It is. And so it took a long time. And I think nobody seems to challenge the statement that

1:04:16.960 --> 1:04:21.360
 this is the most precision, precise instrument it's ever been built, LIGO.

1:04:22.640 --> 1:04:25.680
 I wonder what like listening to Led Zeppelin sounds on this thing,

1:04:25.680 --> 1:04:30.080
 because it's so isolated. I mean, this is like, I don't know.

1:04:30.080 --> 1:04:37.520
 No background. No, no back. It's wow. Wow. Wow. So when you were first

1:04:37.520 --> 1:04:44.240
 conceiving this, I would probably, if I was knowledgeable enough,

1:04:44.240 --> 1:04:48.080
 kind of laugh off the possibility that this is even possible.

1:04:48.080 --> 1:04:54.880
 I'm sure, like how many people believe that this is possible? Did you believe this is possible?

1:04:54.880 --> 1:05:00.320
 I did. I didn't know that we needed, for sure that we needed active. When we started,

1:05:00.320 --> 1:05:08.320
 we did dispassive, but we were doing the tests to develop the active to add as a second stage,

1:05:08.320 --> 1:05:15.680
 which we ended up needing. But there was a lot of, you know, now there was a lot of skepticism.

1:05:15.680 --> 1:05:20.400
 A lot of us, especially astronomers, felt that money was being wasted,

1:05:20.400 --> 1:05:26.160
 because we were also expensive. Doing what I told you is not cheap. So it was kind of

1:05:26.160 --> 1:05:32.240
 controversial. It was funded by the National Science Foundation. Can you just linger on this

1:05:32.240 --> 1:05:41.280
 just for a little longer? The actuator thing, the act of canceling. Do you remember like little

1:05:41.280 --> 1:05:46.720
 experiments that were done along the way to prove to the team themselves that this is even possible?

1:05:49.120 --> 1:05:54.080
 Because I work with quite a bit of robots, and to me, the idea that you could do it this precisely

1:05:54.080 --> 1:06:01.520
 is humbling and embarrassing, frankly. Because like, this is another level of precision that I

1:06:01.520 --> 1:06:10.960
 can't even, because robots are a mess. And this is basically one of the most precise robots ever.

1:06:12.800 --> 1:06:18.240
 Right. So like, is there, do you have any like small scale experiments that were done that just

1:06:18.240 --> 1:06:27.040
 be like, this is possible? Yeah, and larger scale. We made a test, that also has to be in vacuum too,

1:06:27.040 --> 1:06:33.280
 but we made test chambers that had this system in it, our first mock of this system, so we could test

1:06:33.280 --> 1:06:41.040
 it and optimize it and make it work. But it's just a mechanical engineering problem. Okay.

1:06:41.040 --> 1:06:49.280
 And humans are just ape descendants. I gotcha. I gotcha. Is there any video of this? Like some kind

1:06:49.280 --> 1:06:56.160
 of educational purpose visualizations of this act of canceling? I don't think so.

1:06:58.160 --> 1:07:04.560
 I mean, does this live on? Well, we work for parts of it, for the active canceling,

1:07:04.560 --> 1:07:11.680
 we worked with, for the instruments, for the sensor and instruments, we worked with a small

1:07:11.680 --> 1:07:17.600
 company near where you are, because it was our MIT people that got them that were, you know,

1:07:17.600 --> 1:07:21.680
 interested in the problem because they thought they might be able to commercialize it for

1:07:22.240 --> 1:07:28.400
 making stable tables to make microelectronics, for example, which are limited by how stable the table

1:07:28.400 --> 1:07:35.200
 is. I mean, at this point, it's a little expensive. So you never know, never know where this leads.

1:07:36.400 --> 1:07:45.200
 So maybe on the, let me ask you, just sticking it a little longer, this silly old mechanical

1:07:45.200 --> 1:07:53.520
 engineering problem. What was to you kind of the darkest moment of what was the hardest

1:07:53.520 --> 1:07:58.320
 stumbling block to get over on the engineer side? Like, was there any time where there's a doubt,

1:07:58.320 --> 1:08:03.920
 where it's like, I'm not sure we would be able to do this, a kind of engineering challenge that was

1:08:03.920 --> 1:08:11.680
 hit? Do you remember anything like that? I think the one that my colleague at MIT,

1:08:11.680 --> 1:08:18.720
 Ray Weiss, worked on so hard and was much more of a worry than this. This is only a question if you're

1:08:18.720 --> 1:08:26.400
 not doing well enough, you have to keep making it better somehow. But this whole huge instrument has

1:08:26.400 --> 1:08:34.720
 to be in vacuum. And the vacuum tanks are, you know, this big around. And so it's the world's

1:08:34.720 --> 1:08:42.720
 biggest high vacuum system. And how do you make it? First of all, how do you make this four meter

1:08:42.720 --> 1:08:48.640
 long sealed vacuum system? It has to be made out of four kilometers, four kilometers long. Would I

1:08:48.640 --> 1:08:55.360
 say something else? Meters. Four kilometers long. Big difference. Yeah. And so, but to make it,

1:08:55.360 --> 1:09:04.480
 yeah, we started with a roll of stainless steel, and then we roll it out like a spiral so that

1:09:04.480 --> 1:09:14.160
 there's a spiral weld on it. Okay, so the engineering was fine. We did that. We worked through

1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:23.520
 very good companies and so forth to build it. But the big worry was, what if you develop a leak?

1:09:25.280 --> 1:09:31.200
 This is a high vacuum, not just vacuum system. Typically, in a laboratory, if there's a leak,

1:09:31.200 --> 1:09:40.000
 you put helium around the thing you have, and then you detect where the helium is coming in.

1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:44.080
 But if you have something as big as this, you can't surround it with helium. So you might not

1:09:44.080 --> 1:09:51.280
 actually even know that there's a leak and it will be affecting it. Well, we can measure how

1:09:51.280 --> 1:09:58.080
 good the vacuum is so we can know that, but a leak can develop and then we don't, how do we fix it

1:09:58.080 --> 1:10:04.880
 or how do we find it? And so that was, you asked about a worry. That was always a really big worry.

1:10:04.880 --> 1:10:10.960
 What's the difference, you know, high vacuum and a vacuum? What is high vacuum? That's like some

1:10:11.840 --> 1:10:20.640
 delta close to vacuum? Is it some threshold? Well, there's a unit. High vacuum is when the vacuum

1:10:20.640 --> 1:10:27.040
 and the units that are used, which are tors, there's 10 to the minus nine. And there's high

1:10:27.040 --> 1:10:35.600
 vacuum is usually used in small places. The biggest vacuum system period is at CERN in this

1:10:35.600 --> 1:10:40.080
 big particle accelerator, but the high vacuum where they need really good vacuum so particles

1:10:40.080 --> 1:10:47.520
 don't scatter in it is smaller than ours. So ours is a really large high vacuum system.

1:10:47.520 --> 1:10:53.600
 I don't know. This is so cool. I mean, this is basically by far the greatest listening device

1:10:53.600 --> 1:10:59.680
 ever built by human. The fact that like descendants of apes could do this, that evolution started with

1:10:59.680 --> 1:11:07.200
 single cell organisms. I mean, is there any more, I'm a huge theory is like, yeah, yeah. But like

1:11:07.200 --> 1:11:11.360
 bridges, when I look at bridges from a civil engineering perspective, it's one of the most

1:11:11.360 --> 1:11:17.200
 beautiful creations by human beings. It's physics. You're using physics to construct objects that

1:11:17.200 --> 1:11:21.760
 can support huge amount of mass and it's like structural, but it's also beautiful.

1:11:21.760 --> 1:11:26.480
 And that humans can collaborate to create that throughout history. And then you take this

1:11:26.480 --> 1:11:35.040
 on another level. This is, this is like, it's exciting to me beyond measure that humans can

1:11:35.040 --> 1:11:41.600
 create something so precise. But another concept lost in this, you just said, you started talking

1:11:41.600 --> 1:11:47.120
 about single cell. Yeah. Okay. You have to realize this discovery that we made that everybody's

1:11:47.120 --> 1:11:55.360
 bought off on happened 1.3 billion years ago, somewhere. And then the signal came to us 1.3

1:11:55.360 --> 1:12:00.880
 billion years ago, we were just converting on the earth from single cell to multi cell life.

1:12:01.440 --> 1:12:07.360
 So when this actually happened, this collision of two black holes, we weren't here. We weren't

1:12:07.360 --> 1:12:14.000
 even close to developing single. Yeah, we were had, we're going from single cell to multi cell

1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:20.720
 life at that point. All to meet up at this, at this point. Yeah. Wow. That's like, that's almost

1:12:20.720 --> 1:12:32.560
 romantic. It is. Okay. So on the human side of things, it's kind of fascinating because you're

1:12:32.560 --> 1:12:39.040
 talking about over a thousand people team for LIGO. Yeah. They started out with, you know,

1:12:39.040 --> 1:12:48.400
 around a hundred and you've for parts of the time at least led this team. What does it take to lead

1:12:48.400 --> 1:12:56.160
 a team like this of incredibly brilliant theoreticians and engineers and just a lot of

1:12:56.160 --> 1:13:03.200
 different parties involved? A lot of egos, a lot of ideas. You had this fun, funny example,

1:13:03.200 --> 1:13:10.720
 I forget where, where in publishing a paper, you have to all agree on like, you know, the phrasing

1:13:10.720 --> 1:13:15.040
 of a certain sentence or the title of the paper and so on. That's a very interesting, simple

1:13:15.040 --> 1:13:20.080
 example. I'd love you to speak to that, but just in general, how, what does it take to lead this

1:13:20.080 --> 1:13:28.800
 kind of team? Okay. I think that the general idea is one we all know. You want to, you want to,

1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:37.040
 you want to get where the, the sum of something is more than the individual parts is what we say,

1:13:37.040 --> 1:13:42.640
 right? Yeah. So that's what you're trying to achieve. Yes. Okay. How do you do that? Actually,

1:13:42.640 --> 1:13:49.280
 mostly if we take multiple objects or people, I mean, you put them together, the sum is less.

1:13:49.280 --> 1:13:56.400
 Yes. Why? Because they overlap. So you don't have individual things that, you know, this

1:13:56.400 --> 1:14:02.320
 person does that, this person does that, then you get exactly the sum. But what you want is to

1:14:02.320 --> 1:14:07.120
 develop where you get more than what the individual contributions are. We know that's

1:14:07.120 --> 1:14:14.160
 very common. People use that expression everywhere. And it's the expression that has to be kind of

1:14:14.160 --> 1:14:21.440
 built into how people feel it's working. Because if you're part of a team, and you realize that

1:14:21.440 --> 1:14:27.440
 somehow the team is able to do more than the individuals could do themselves, then they buy on

1:14:27.440 --> 1:14:36.000
 kind of in terms of the process. So that's the, that's the goal that you have to have is to, to

1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:45.840
 achieve that. And that means that you have to realize parts of what you're trying to do that

1:14:45.840 --> 1:14:52.240
 require not that one person couldn't do it, it requires the combined talents to be able to do

1:14:52.240 --> 1:14:57.200
 something that neither of them could do themselves. And we have a lot of that kind of thing. And I

1:14:57.200 --> 1:15:06.320
 think, I mean, build into the some of the examples that I gave you. And so, how do you then, so, so

1:15:06.320 --> 1:15:12.400
 the key almost in anything you do is the people themselves, right? So in our case,

1:15:12.400 --> 1:15:20.880
 the first and most important was to attract to spend years of their life on this. And the best

1:15:20.880 --> 1:15:27.200
 possible people in the world to do it. So the only way to convince them is that somehow it's

1:15:28.800 --> 1:15:34.080
 better and more interesting for them than what they could do themselves. And so that's part of

1:15:34.080 --> 1:15:42.240
 this idea. Yeah, that's powerful. But nevertheless, there's best people in the world, there's egos. Is

1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:47.840
 there something to be said about managing egos? Oh, that's the human problem is always the hardest.

1:15:47.840 --> 1:15:56.080
 And so there's, that's an art, not a science, I think. I think the fact here that combined,

1:15:56.080 --> 1:16:06.240
 there's a was a romantic goal that we had to, you know, do something that people hadn't done before,

1:16:06.240 --> 1:16:19.600
 which was important scientifically and, and a huge challenge, enabled us to say, take and get, I mean,

1:16:19.600 --> 1:16:24.320
 what we did just to take an example, we use the light to go in this thing comes from lasers.

1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:30.960
 We need a certain kind of laser. So the kind of laser that we use, there were three different

1:16:32.560 --> 1:16:37.520
 institutions in the world that had the experts that do this, maybe in competition with each other.

1:16:38.240 --> 1:16:45.040
 So we got all three to join together and work with us to work on this as an example. So that

1:16:45.040 --> 1:16:51.680
 you had, and they had the thing that they were working together on a kind of object that they

1:16:51.680 --> 1:16:57.280
 wouldn't have otherwise. And we're part of a bigger team where they could discover something

1:16:57.280 --> 1:17:03.520
 that isn't even engineers. These are engineers that do laser. So, and they're part of our laser

1:17:03.520 --> 1:17:14.480
 physicists. So could you describe the moment or the period of time when finally this incredible

1:17:14.480 --> 1:17:22.160
 creation of human beings led to a detection of gravitational waves? It's a long story. Unfortunately,

1:17:22.160 --> 1:17:28.560
 this is a part that we started failures along the way kind of thing or all failures. That's all

1:17:28.560 --> 1:17:36.080
 that's built into it. If you're not, if you're not mechanical engineering, you build on your failures,

1:17:36.080 --> 1:17:41.360
 that's expected. So we're trying things that no one's done before. So it's technically not just

1:17:41.360 --> 1:17:48.480
 gravitational waves. And so it's built on failures. But anyway, we did before me, even

1:17:48.480 --> 1:17:57.920
 there, the people did R&D on the concepts. But starting in 1994, we got money from the National

1:17:57.920 --> 1:18:06.240
 Science Foundation to build this thing. It took about five years to build it. So by 1999, we had

1:18:06.240 --> 1:18:13.920
 built the basic unit. It did not have active seismic isolation at that stage, didn't have some

1:18:13.920 --> 1:18:26.960
 other things that we have now. What we did at the beginning was stick to technologies that we had

1:18:27.360 --> 1:18:33.840
 at least enough knowledge that we could make work or had tested in our own laboratories. And so then

1:18:33.840 --> 1:18:41.040
 we put together the instrument. We made it work. It didn't work very well, but it worked. And we

1:18:41.040 --> 1:18:45.600
 didn't see any gravitational waves. Then we figured out what limited us. And we went through this

1:18:45.600 --> 1:18:55.520
 every year for almost 10 years, never seeing gravitational waves. We would run it, looking for

1:18:55.520 --> 1:19:06.320
 gravitational waves for months, learn what limited us, fix it for months, and then run it again.

1:19:06.320 --> 1:19:13.280
 Eventually, we knew we had to take another big step. And that's when we made several changes,

1:19:13.280 --> 1:19:21.600
 including adding these active seismic isolation, which turned out to be a key. And we

1:19:21.600 --> 1:19:27.520
 fortunately got the National Science Foundation to give us another couple hundred million dollars,

1:19:27.520 --> 1:19:42.080
 100 million more. And we rebuild it or fixed or improved it. And then in 2015, we turned it on.

1:19:42.080 --> 1:19:50.560
 And we almost instantly saw this first collision of two black holes.

1:19:53.600 --> 1:19:58.560
 And then we went through a process of, do we believe what we've seen?

1:19:58.560 --> 1:20:02.400
 Yeah, I think you're one of the people that went through that process. It sounds like some people

1:20:02.400 --> 1:20:05.600
 immediately believed it. And then you're like...

1:20:05.600 --> 1:20:10.080
 So as human beings, we all have different reactions to almost anything. And so

1:20:10.080 --> 1:20:20.160
 quite a few of my colleagues had a eureka moment immediately. I mean, the figure that we put in our

1:20:20.160 --> 1:20:27.840
 paper, first is just data. We didn't have to go through fancy computer programs to do anything.

1:20:27.840 --> 1:20:36.080
 And we show next to it the calculations of Einstein's equations. It looks just like what

1:20:36.080 --> 1:20:42.000
 we detected. And we did it in two different detectors halfway across the US. So it was

1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:53.920
 pretty convincing, but you don't want to fool yourself. So being a scientist, for me, we had

1:20:53.920 --> 1:20:58.000
 to go through and try to understand that the instrument itself, which was new, I said we had

1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:06.240
 rebuild it, couldn't somehow generate things that look like this. That took some tests. And then the

1:21:06.240 --> 1:21:12.080
 second, you'll appreciate more, we had to somehow convince ourselves we weren't hacked in some

1:21:12.080 --> 1:21:12.800
 clever way.

1:21:12.800 --> 1:21:14.320
 Cybersecurity question.

1:21:14.320 --> 1:21:18.000
 Yeah. Even though we're not on the internet, but...

1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:23.520
 Yeah. No, it can be physical access too. Yeah. That's fascinating. It's fascinating that you

1:21:23.520 --> 1:21:34.560
 would think about that. I mean, not enough. I mean, because it matches prediction. So the chances

1:21:34.560 --> 1:21:38.320
 of it actually being manipulated is very, very low. But nevertheless...

1:21:38.320 --> 1:21:42.800
 We still could have disgruntled all the graduate students who had worked with us earlier that...

1:21:43.520 --> 1:21:48.880
 Who want you to... I don't know how that's supposed to embarrass you. I suppose, yeah. I suppose I

1:21:48.880 --> 1:21:55.360
 see. But about what I think you said, within a month, you kind of convinced yourself officially.

1:21:55.360 --> 1:22:01.520
 Within a month, we convinced ourselves. We kept a thousand collaborators quiet during that time.

1:22:01.520 --> 1:22:10.080
 Then we spent another month or so trying to understand what we'd seen so that we could do the

1:22:10.080 --> 1:22:14.480
 science with it instead of just putting it out to the world and let somebody else understand that it

1:22:14.480 --> 1:22:19.680
 was two black holes and what it was. The fact that a thousand collaborators were quiet

1:22:20.480 --> 1:22:25.600
 is a really strong indication that this is a really close knit team. Yeah. And they're around

1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:35.200
 the world. Either strong knit or tight knit or had a strong dictatorship or something. Yeah.

1:22:35.200 --> 1:22:39.120
 Either fear or love. You can rule by fear or love. Yeah, right. You can go back to Machiavelli.

1:22:39.120 --> 1:22:51.760
 Yeah. All right. Well, this is really exciting that that's a success story because it didn't

1:22:51.760 --> 1:22:56.720
 have to be a success story, right? I mean, eventually, perhaps you could say it'll be an

1:22:56.720 --> 1:23:06.160
 event, but it could have taken over a century to get there. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And it's only downhill

1:23:06.160 --> 1:23:18.240
 now. What do you mean? You mean with gravitational waves? Yeah. Well, now we're off because of the

1:23:18.240 --> 1:23:25.120
 pandemic, but when we turned off, we were seeing some sort of gravitational wave event each week.

1:23:26.880 --> 1:23:32.560
 Now we're fixing, we're adding features where it'll probably be when we turn back on next year,

1:23:32.560 --> 1:23:37.520
 it'll probably be one every couple days. And they're not all the same. So it's

1:23:38.160 --> 1:23:45.840
 learning about what's out there in gravity instead of just optics. So it's all great.

1:23:45.840 --> 1:23:54.880
 We're only limited by the fantastic thing other than that this is a great field and it's all new

1:23:54.880 --> 1:24:04.000
 and so forth is that experimentally, the great thing is that we're limited by technology and

1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:16.400
 technical limitations, not by science. So another really important discovery that was made before

1:24:16.400 --> 1:24:23.200
 ours was what's called the Higgs boson made on the big accelerator at CERN. This huge accelerator,

1:24:23.200 --> 1:24:29.360
 they discovered a really important thing. We have Einstein's equation, E equals MC squared.

1:24:29.920 --> 1:24:37.040
 So energy makes mass or mass can make energy and that's the bomb. But the mechanism by which that

1:24:37.040 --> 1:24:48.560
 happens, not vision, but how do you create mass from energy was never understood until there was

1:24:48.560 --> 1:24:58.400
 a theory of it about 70 years ago now. And so they discovered it's named after a man named Higgs.

1:24:58.400 --> 1:25:05.120
 It's called the Higgs boson. And so it was discovered, but since that time, and I worked

1:25:05.120 --> 1:25:09.920
 on those experiments since that time, they haven't been able to progress very much further,

1:25:09.920 --> 1:25:14.240
 a little bit, but not a lot further. And the difference is that we're really lucky

1:25:14.240 --> 1:25:22.880
 we're in what we're doing in that there you see this Higgs boson, but there's tremendous amount

1:25:22.880 --> 1:25:28.080
 of other physics that goes on and you have to pick out the needle in the haystack of physics.

1:25:28.080 --> 1:25:34.480
 You can't make the physics go away, it's there. In our case, we have a very weak signal, but once we

1:25:34.480 --> 1:25:40.080
 get good enough to see it, it's weak compared to where we've reduced the background, but the

1:25:40.080 --> 1:25:47.600
 background is not physics, it's just technology. It's getting ourselves better isolated from the

1:25:47.600 --> 1:25:56.160
 Earth or getting a more powerful laser. And so since 2015, when we saw the first one,

1:25:56.160 --> 1:26:03.040
 we continually can make improvements that are enabling us to turn this into a real science

1:26:03.040 --> 1:26:12.560
 to do astronomy, a new kind of astronomy. It's a little like astronomy. Galileo started the field.

1:26:12.560 --> 1:26:20.080
 He basically took lenses that were made for classes and he didn't invent the first telescope,

1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:28.880
 but made a telescope, looked at Neptune and saw that it had four moons. That was the birth of

1:26:28.880 --> 1:26:34.880
 not just using your eyes to understand what's out there. And since that time, we've made better and

1:26:34.880 --> 1:26:41.920
 better telescopes, obviously, and astronomy thrives. And in a similar way, we're starting to

1:26:41.920 --> 1:26:49.920
 be able to crawl, but we're starting to be able to do that with gravitational waves. And it's

1:26:49.920 --> 1:26:55.600
 going to be more and more that we can do as we can make better and better instruments because,

1:26:55.600 --> 1:27:02.400
 as I say, it's not limited by picking it out of others. Yeah, it's not limited by the physics.

1:27:02.400 --> 1:27:10.080
 So you have an optimism about engineering that as human progress marches on,

1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:17.280
 engineering will always find a way to build a large enough device,

1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:21.360
 accurate enough device to detect the same thing. As long as it's not limited by physics,

1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:34.720
 yeah, they'll do it. So you, two other folks and the entire team won the Nobel prize for this big

1:27:34.720 --> 1:27:49.680
 effort. There's a million questions I can ask for, but looking back, where does the Nobel prize

1:27:49.680 --> 1:27:57.920
 fit into all of this? If you think hundreds of years from now, I venture to say that people

1:27:57.920 --> 1:28:03.360
 will not remember the winners of a prize, but they'll remember creations like these.

1:28:03.360 --> 1:28:10.880
 Maybe I'm romanticizing engineering, but I guess I want to ask how important is the Nobel prize in

1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:22.240
 all of this? Well, that's a complicated question. As a physicist, it's something if you're trying

1:28:22.240 --> 1:28:30.960
 to win a Nobel prize, forget it because they give one a year. So there's been 200 physicists

1:28:30.960 --> 1:28:40.240
 who have won the Nobel prize since 1900. And so things just have to fall right. So your goal cannot

1:28:40.240 --> 1:28:51.600
 be to win a Nobel prize. It wasn't my dream. It's tremendous for science. Why the Nobel prize for a

1:28:51.600 --> 1:28:58.400
 guy that made dynamite and stuff is what it is. It's a long story, but it's the one day a year

1:28:58.400 --> 1:29:04.720
 where actually the science that people have done is all over the world and so forth. Forget about

1:29:04.720 --> 1:29:14.080
 the people again. It is really good for science. It celebrates science for several days, different

1:29:14.080 --> 1:29:21.280
 fields, chemistry, medicine and so forth. And everybody doesn't understand everything about

1:29:21.280 --> 1:29:27.760
 these. They're generally fairly abstract, but then it's on the front page of newspapers around

1:29:27.760 --> 1:29:32.080
 the world. So it's really good for science. It's not easy to get science on the front page of the

1:29:32.080 --> 1:29:41.760
 New York Times. It's not there. Should be, but it's not. And so the Nobel prize is important in that

1:29:41.760 --> 1:29:53.520
 way. Otherwise, I have a certain celebrity that I didn't have before. And now you get to be a

1:29:53.520 --> 1:30:01.280
 celebrity that advertises science. It's a mechanism to remind us how incredible, how much credit

1:30:01.280 --> 1:30:06.240
 science deserves and everything. Well, it has a little bit more. One thing I didn't expect,

1:30:06.240 --> 1:30:16.720
 which is good, is that we have a government. I'm not picking on ours necessarily, but it's true of

1:30:16.720 --> 1:30:23.040
 all governments are not run by scientists. In our case, it's run by lawyers and businessmen.

1:30:23.040 --> 1:30:29.520
 Yep. Okay. And at best they may have an aide or something that knows a little science. So

1:30:33.120 --> 1:30:42.640
 in all countries hardly take into account science in making decisions.

1:30:42.640 --> 1:30:44.320
 Yes. Okay. And

1:30:44.320 --> 1:30:53.200
 having a Nobel prize, the people in those positions actually listen. So you have more

1:30:53.200 --> 1:30:58.160
 influence. I don't care whether it's about global warming or what the issue is. There's some

1:30:58.160 --> 1:31:05.120
 influence, which is lacking otherwise. And people pay attention to what I say. If I talk about

1:31:05.120 --> 1:31:12.160
 global warming, they wouldn't have before I had the Nobel prize. Yeah, this is very true. You're

1:31:12.160 --> 1:31:20.000
 like the celebrities who talk. Celebrity has power. Celebrity has power. And that's a good

1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:24.880
 thing. That's a good thing. Singling out people, I mean, on the other side of it, singling out

1:31:24.880 --> 1:31:32.320
 people has all kinds of, whether it's for Academy Awards or for this, have unfairness and

1:31:32.320 --> 1:31:39.920
 arbitrariness and so forth and so on. So that's the other side of the coin. Just like you said,

1:31:39.920 --> 1:31:45.280
 especially with the huge experimental projects like this, you know, it's a large team and it

1:31:45.280 --> 1:31:49.760
 does the nature of the Nobel prizes. It singles out a few individuals to represent the team.

1:31:49.760 --> 1:31:57.440
 Yeah. Nevertheless, it's a beautiful thing. What are ways to improve LIGO in the future,

1:31:57.440 --> 1:32:03.520
 increase the sensitivity? I've seen a few ideas that are kind of fascinating. Are you interested

1:32:03.520 --> 1:32:09.680
 in them? I'm not speaking about five years. Perhaps you could speak to the next five years,

1:32:09.680 --> 1:32:16.080
 but also the next hundred years. Yeah. So let me talk to both the instrument and the science.

1:32:16.080 --> 1:32:21.200
 Sure. So they go hand in hand. I mean, the thing that I said is if we make it better,

1:32:21.920 --> 1:32:29.760
 we see more kinds of weaker objects and we do astronomy. Okay. We're very motivated to make

1:32:29.760 --> 1:32:36.240
 a new instrument, which will be a big step, the next step, like making a new kind of telescope or

1:32:36.240 --> 1:32:44.400
 something. And the ideas of what that instrument should be haven't converged yet. There's different

1:32:44.400 --> 1:32:52.480
 ideas in Europe. They've done more work to kind of develop the ideas, but they're different from

1:32:52.480 --> 1:32:59.840
 ours and we have ideas. But I think over the next few years, we'll develop those. The idea is to make

1:32:59.840 --> 1:33:06.240
 an instrument that's at least 10 times better than what we can do with this instrument, 10 times

1:33:06.240 --> 1:33:13.600
 better than that. 10 times better means you can look 10 times further out. 10 times further out

1:33:13.600 --> 1:33:21.680
 is a thousand times more volume. So you're seeing much, much more of the universe. The best way to

1:33:21.680 --> 1:33:29.280
 look at it is to look further out. The big change is that if you can see far out, you see further

1:33:29.280 --> 1:33:36.080
 back in history. Yeah, you're traveling back in time. Yeah. And so we can start to do what we

1:33:36.080 --> 1:33:44.160
 call cosmology instead of astronomy or astrophysics. Cosmology is really the study of the evolution of

1:33:44.160 --> 1:33:52.400
 the universe. And so then you can start to hope to get to the important problems having to do with

1:33:53.920 --> 1:34:01.600
 how the universe began, how it evolved and so forth, which we really only study now with

1:34:02.160 --> 1:34:12.320
 optical instruments or electromagnetic waves. And early in the universe, those were blocked because

1:34:12.320 --> 1:34:18.960
 it was, basically it wasn't transparent. So the photons couldn't get out when everything was too

1:34:18.960 --> 1:34:24.240
 dense. What do you think, sorry on this tangent, what do you think an understanding of gravitational

1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:28.560
 waves from earlier in the universe can help us understand about the Big Bang and all that kind

1:34:28.560 --> 1:34:37.120
 of stuff? Yeah. But it's a non, it's another perspective on the thing. Is there some insights

1:34:37.120 --> 1:34:43.040
 you think could be revealed just to help a layman understand? Sure. First, we don't understand. We

1:34:43.040 --> 1:34:47.920
 use the word Big Bang. We don't understand the physics of what the Big Bang itself was.

1:34:50.320 --> 1:34:58.160
 So I think, and in the early stage, there were particles and there was a huge amount of gravity

1:34:58.160 --> 1:35:10.240
 and mass being made. So I'll say two things. One is, how did it all start? How did it happen? I'll

1:35:10.240 --> 1:35:16.000
 give you at least one example that we don't understand what we should understand. We don't

1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:24.000
 know why we're here. Yes. No, we do not. I don't mean it philosophically. I mean it in terms of

1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:30.720
 physics. Now, what do I mean by that? If I go into my laboratory at CERN or somewhere and I

1:35:30.720 --> 1:35:38.480
 collide particles together or put energy together, I make as much anti matter as matter. Anti matter

1:35:38.480 --> 1:35:49.120
 then annihilates matter and makes energy. So in the early universe, you made somehow a lot of

1:35:49.120 --> 1:35:54.960
 matter and anti matter, but there was an asymmetry. Somehow there was more matter and anti matter.

1:35:55.520 --> 1:35:59.520
 The matter and anti matter annihilated each other. At least that's what we think.

1:35:59.520 --> 1:36:04.960
 And there was only matter leftover. And we live in a universe that we see this all matter.

1:36:05.840 --> 1:36:12.640
 We don't have any idea. We have ideas, but we don't have any way to understand that at the

1:36:12.640 --> 1:36:19.600
 present time with the physics that we know. Can I ask a dumb question? Does anti matter have

1:36:19.600 --> 1:36:29.040
 anything like a gravitational field to send signals? So how does this asymmetry of matter

1:36:29.040 --> 1:36:35.520
 and anti matter could be investigated or further understood by observing gravitational fields or

1:36:35.520 --> 1:36:45.360
 weirdnesses in gravitational fields? I think that in principle, if there were anti neutron stars,

1:36:45.360 --> 1:36:51.280
 instead of just neutron stars, we would see different kinds of signals, but it didn't get

1:36:51.280 --> 1:36:56.960
 to that. We live in a universe that we've done enough looking because we don't see anti matter,

1:36:56.960 --> 1:37:01.280
 anti protons anywhere, no matter what we look at, that it's all made out of matter.

1:37:01.280 --> 1:37:04.800
 Hmm. There is no anti matter except when we go in our laboratories.

1:37:06.400 --> 1:37:11.280
 So, but when we go in our laboratories, we make as much anti matter as matter.

1:37:11.280 --> 1:37:16.320
 So there's something about the early universe that made this asymmetry. So we can't even

1:37:16.320 --> 1:37:25.360
 explain why we're here. That's what I meant. Physics wise, not in terms of how we evolved

1:37:25.360 --> 1:37:36.080
 and all that kind of stuff. So there might be inklings of some of the physics that gravitational

1:37:36.080 --> 1:37:42.720
 So gravitational waves don't get obstructed like light. So I said light only goes to 300,000 years.

1:37:42.720 --> 1:37:47.520
 So it goes back to the beginning. So if you could study the early universe with gravitational waves,

1:37:47.520 --> 1:37:54.240
 we can't do that yet. Then it took 400 years to be able to do that with optical, but

1:37:54.240 --> 1:37:59.360
 but then you can really understand the very, maybe understand the very early universe.

1:38:00.400 --> 1:38:10.400
 So in terms of questions like why we're here or what the big bang was, we should be, we can,

1:38:10.400 --> 1:38:15.360
 in principle, study that with gravitational waves. So to keep moving in this direction,

1:38:15.360 --> 1:38:20.400
 it's a unique kind of way to understand our universe.

1:38:20.400 --> 1:38:24.640
 So you think there's more Nobel prize level ideas to be discovered in relation to

1:38:25.200 --> 1:38:31.680
 I'd be shocked if there, if there isn't, not even going to that, which is a very long range problem.

1:38:31.680 --> 1:38:39.280
 But I think that we only see with electromagnetic waves, 4% of what's out there.

1:38:39.280 --> 1:38:48.240
 There must be, we looked for things that we knew should be there. There should be,

1:38:48.240 --> 1:38:58.960
 I would be shocked if there wasn't physics, objects, science, and with gravity that doesn't

1:38:58.960 --> 1:39:06.480
 show up in everything we do with telescopes. So I think we're just limited by not having

1:39:06.480 --> 1:39:09.280
 powerful enough instruments yet to do this.

1:39:10.400 --> 1:39:16.560
 Do you have a preference? I keep seeing this E. Lisa idea.

1:39:17.200 --> 1:39:17.440
 Yeah.

1:39:18.240 --> 1:39:26.960
 Is it, do you have a preference for earthbound or space faring mechanisms for?

1:39:26.960 --> 1:39:32.880
 They're complimentary. It's a little bit like, it's completely analogous to what's been done

1:39:32.880 --> 1:39:39.760
 in astronomy. So astronomy from the time of Galileo was done with visible light.

1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:46.560
 The big advances in astronomy in the last 50 years are because we have instruments that look

1:39:46.560 --> 1:39:54.160
 at the infrared, microwave, ultraviolet and so forth. So looking at different wavelengths

1:39:54.160 --> 1:40:00.240
 has been important. Basically going into space means that we'll look at instead of the audio

1:40:00.240 --> 1:40:04.880
 band, which we look at, as we said on the Earth's surface, we'll look at lower frequencies.

1:40:05.680 --> 1:40:10.960
 So it's completely complimentary and it starts to be looking at different frequencies just

1:40:10.960 --> 1:40:12.400
 like we do with astronomy.

1:40:14.320 --> 1:40:18.960
 It seems almost incredible to me, engineering wise, just like on earth to send something

1:40:18.960 --> 1:40:25.360
 that's kilometers across into space. Is that harder to engineer?

1:40:25.360 --> 1:40:32.880
 It actually is a little different. It's three satellites separated by hundreds of thousands

1:40:32.880 --> 1:40:42.960
 of kilometers and they send a laser beam from one to the other. And if the triangle changes

1:40:42.960 --> 1:40:45.360
 shape a little bit, they detect that from a graph.

1:40:45.360 --> 1:40:56.160
 Did you say hundreds of thousands of kilometers? Yeah. Sending lasers to each other. Okay.

1:40:56.160 --> 1:40:57.200
 It's just engineering.

1:40:59.920 --> 1:41:02.160
 Is it possible though? Is it doable?

1:41:02.160 --> 1:41:02.400
 Yes.

1:41:03.520 --> 1:41:11.040
 Okay. That's just incredible because they have to maintain, I mean, the precision here

1:41:11.040 --> 1:41:16.800
 is probably, there might be some more, what is it? Maybe noise is a smaller problem. I

1:41:16.800 --> 1:41:22.880
 guess there's no vibration to worry about like seismic stuff. So getting away from earth,

1:41:22.880 --> 1:41:23.680
 maybe you get away from seismic stuff.

1:41:23.680 --> 1:41:28.160
 Yeah. Those parts are easier. They don't have to measure it as accurately at low frequencies.

1:41:29.200 --> 1:41:33.200
 But they have a lot of tough engineering problems.

1:41:33.200 --> 1:41:44.000
 In order to detect that the gravitational waves affect things, the sensors have to be

1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:48.400
 what we call free masses, just like ours, are isolated from the earth. They have to

1:41:48.400 --> 1:41:54.080
 isolate it from the satellite. And that's a hard problem. They have to do that pretty,

1:41:54.080 --> 1:42:00.080
 not as well as we have to do it, but very well. And they've done a test mission and

1:42:00.080 --> 1:42:06.880
 the engineering seems to be at least in principle in hand. This will be in the 2030s.

1:42:06.880 --> 1:42:07.920
 2030s?

1:42:07.920 --> 1:42:08.160
 Yeah.

1:42:09.600 --> 1:42:16.080
 This is incredible. This is incredible. Let me ask about black holes.

1:42:17.200 --> 1:42:27.440
 So what we're talking about is observing orbiting black holes. I saw the terminology of like

1:42:27.440 --> 1:42:28.880
 binary black hole systems.

1:42:28.880 --> 1:42:29.680
 Binary black holes.

1:42:29.680 --> 1:42:33.040
 Is that the one that's when they're dancing? Okay.

1:42:33.040 --> 1:42:36.080
 They're both going around each other, just like the earth around the sun.

1:42:36.080 --> 1:42:39.440
 Okay. Is that weird that there's black holes going around each other?

1:42:40.080 --> 1:42:45.200
 So the finding binary systems of stars is similar to finding binary systems of...

1:42:45.840 --> 1:42:46.560
 Of black holes.

1:42:46.560 --> 1:42:55.760
 Well, they were once stars. So we haven't said what a black hole is physically yet.

1:42:55.760 --> 1:42:56.880
 Yeah. What's a black hole?

1:42:56.880 --> 1:43:03.280
 So black hole is first, it's a mathematical concept or a physical concept. And that is

1:43:03.840 --> 1:43:10.640
 a region of space. So it's simply a region of space where the curvature of space time,

1:43:10.640 --> 1:43:17.920
 meaning the gravitational field is so strong that nothing can get out, including light.

1:43:19.040 --> 1:43:26.320
 And there's light gets bent if the space time is warped enough.

1:43:26.320 --> 1:43:31.360
 And so even light gets bent around and stays in it. So that's the concept of a black hole.

1:43:33.200 --> 1:43:39.280
 And maybe you can make... So that's a concept that didn't say how they come about.

1:43:40.400 --> 1:43:45.600
 And there could be different ways they come about. The ones that we are seeing,

1:43:48.480 --> 1:43:52.480
 we're not sure. That's what we're trying to learn now is what they...

1:43:52.480 --> 1:44:00.880
 But the general expectation is that they come... These black holes happen when a star dies.

1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:06.400
 So what does that mean that a star dies? What happens? A star like our sun

1:44:08.880 --> 1:44:17.600
 basically makes heat and light by fusion. It's made up. And as it burns, it burns up the hydrogen

1:44:17.600 --> 1:44:24.240
 and then the helium and slowly works its way up to the heavier and heavier elements that are

1:44:24.240 --> 1:44:29.840
 in the star. And when it gets up to iron, the fusion process doesn't work anymore.

1:44:30.560 --> 1:44:37.200
 And so the stars die and that happens to stars. And then they do what's called a supernova.

1:44:37.200 --> 1:44:43.760
 What happens then is that a star is a delicate balance between an outward pressure from fusion

1:44:43.760 --> 1:44:50.080
 and light and burning and an inward pressure of gravity trying to pull the

1:44:51.120 --> 1:44:57.760
 masses together. Once it burns itself out, it goes and it collapses and that's a supernova.

1:44:57.760 --> 1:45:05.440
 When it collapses, all the mass that was there is in a very much smaller space. And if a star,

1:45:05.440 --> 1:45:11.680
 if you do the calculations, if a star is big enough, that can create a strong enough

1:45:11.680 --> 1:45:17.920
 gravitational field to make a black hole. Our sun won't. It's too small.

1:45:17.920 --> 1:45:18.480
 Too small.

1:45:19.200 --> 1:45:26.400
 And we don't know exactly what, but it's usually thought that a star has to be at least three

1:45:26.400 --> 1:45:32.160
 times as big as our sun to make a black hole. But that's the physical way there.

1:45:32.160 --> 1:45:34.800
 You can make black holes. That's the first

1:45:34.800 --> 1:45:41.840
 explanation that one would give for what we see,

1:45:41.840 --> 1:45:45.440
 but it's not necessarily true. We're not sure yet.

1:45:45.440 --> 1:45:48.560
 What we see in terms of, for the origins of black holes?

1:45:48.560 --> 1:45:52.320
 No, the black holes that we see in gravitational waves.

1:45:52.320 --> 1:45:56.720
 So the, but you're also looking for the ones who are binary solar systems.

1:45:56.720 --> 1:46:01.760
 So they're binary systems, but they could have been made from binary stars. So there's binary

1:46:01.760 --> 1:46:07.520
 stars around. So that's, so that's the first explanation is that that's what they are.

1:46:07.520 --> 1:46:07.920
 Gotcha.

1:46:09.760 --> 1:46:16.800
 Other explanations, but what we see has some puzzles. This is kind of the way science works,

1:46:16.800 --> 1:46:29.280
 I guess. We see heavier ones than up to, we've seen one system that was 140 times the mass of

1:46:29.280 --> 1:46:39.760
 our own sun. That's not believed to be possible with the parent being a big star because big

1:46:39.760 --> 1:46:49.120
 stars can only be so big or they are unstable. It's just the fact that they live in an environment

1:46:49.120 --> 1:46:55.920
 that makes them unstable. So the fact that we see bigger ones, they may be come from something else.

1:46:55.920 --> 1:47:04.800
 It's possible that they were made in a different way by little ones eating each other up or maybe

1:47:04.800 --> 1:47:11.600
 they were made or maybe they came with the big bang. The prime, what we call primordial, which

1:47:11.600 --> 1:47:16.160
 means they're really different. They came from that. We don't know at this point if they came

1:47:16.160 --> 1:47:21.040
 with a big bang, then maybe they account for what we call dark matter or some of it.

1:47:21.040 --> 1:47:26.080
 Hmm. Like there was a lot of them if they came with it because there's a lot of dark matter.

1:47:26.080 --> 1:47:26.320
 Yeah.

1:47:27.360 --> 1:47:34.240
 But will gravitational waves give you any kind of intuition about the origin of these oscillating?

1:47:34.240 --> 1:47:39.600
 We think that if we see the distributions enough of them, the distributions of their

1:47:40.320 --> 1:47:45.760
 masses, the distributions of how they're spinning, so we can actually measure when they're going

1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:55.120
 around each other, whether they're spinning like this or whether the whole system has any wobbles.

1:47:55.680 --> 1:47:59.120
 What? So this is now. Okay.

1:48:00.400 --> 1:48:01.280
 We're doing that.

1:48:01.280 --> 1:48:04.400
 And then you're constantly kind of crawling back and back in time.

1:48:04.400 --> 1:48:09.920
 And we're crawling back in time and seeing how many there are as we go back. And so do they

1:48:09.920 --> 1:48:10.480
 point back.

1:48:10.480 --> 1:48:15.920
 So you're like, what is that discipline called, cartography or something? You're like mapping

1:48:15.920 --> 1:48:21.920
 this, the early universe via the lens of gravitational waves.

1:48:21.920 --> 1:48:24.080
 Not yet the early universe, but at least back in time.

1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:24.720
 Earlier.

1:48:24.720 --> 1:48:32.960
 Yeah. So black holes are this mathematical phenomenon, but they come about in different

1:48:32.960 --> 1:48:39.600
 ways. We have a huge black hole at the center of our galaxy and other galaxies. Those probably

1:48:39.600 --> 1:48:44.160
 were made some other way. We don't know when the galaxies themselves had to do with the

1:48:44.160 --> 1:48:49.680
 formation of galaxies. We don't really know. So the fact that we use the word black hole,

1:48:50.240 --> 1:48:56.480
 the origin of black holes might be quite different depending on how they happen. They just have

1:48:56.480 --> 1:49:00.160
 to in the end have a gravitational field that will bend everything in.

1:49:01.200 --> 1:49:06.720
 How do you feel about black holes as a human being? There's this thing that's nearly

1:49:06.720 --> 1:49:13.680
 infinitely dense, doesn't let light escape. Isn't that kind of terrifying? It feels like

1:49:13.680 --> 1:49:14.960
 the stuff in nightmares.

1:49:14.960 --> 1:49:17.600
 I think it's an opportunity.

1:49:19.040 --> 1:49:20.160
 To do what exactly?

1:49:21.360 --> 1:49:26.800
 So like the early universe is an opportunity. If we can study the early universe, we can

1:49:26.800 --> 1:49:32.720
 learn things like I told you. And here again, we have an embarrassing situation in physics.

1:49:32.720 --> 1:49:39.920
 We have two wonderful theories of physics, one based on quantum mechanics, quantum field

1:49:39.920 --> 1:49:46.000
 theory. And we can go to a big accelerator like at CERN and smash particles together

1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:51.840
 and almost explain anything that happens beautifully using quantum field theory and

1:49:51.840 --> 1:49:57.200
 quantum mechanics. Then we have another theory of physics called general relativity, which

1:49:57.200 --> 1:50:02.160
 is what we've been talking about most of the time, which is fantastic at describing the

1:50:02.160 --> 1:50:12.000
 things at high velocities, long distances, and so forth. So that's not the way it's

1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:17.920
 supposed to be. We're trying to create a theory of physics, not two theories of physics.

1:50:18.480 --> 1:50:22.960
 So we have an embarrassment that we have two different theories of physics. People have

1:50:22.960 --> 1:50:28.080
 tried to make a unified theory, what they call a unified theory. You've heard those

1:50:28.080 --> 1:50:36.560
 words for decades. They still haven't. That's been primarily done theoretically or tried.

1:50:36.560 --> 1:50:44.640
 People actively do that. My personal belief is that like much of physics, we need some

1:50:44.640 --> 1:50:51.280
 clues. So we need some experimental evidence. So where is there a place? If we go to CERN

1:50:51.280 --> 1:50:56.160
 and do those experiments, gravitational waves or general relativity don't matter. If we

1:50:56.160 --> 1:51:02.560
 go to study our black holes, elementary particle physics doesn't matter. We're studying these

1:51:02.560 --> 1:51:09.120
 huge objects. So where might we have a place where both phenomena have to be satisfied?

1:51:09.120 --> 1:51:15.920
 An example is black holes. Inside black holes. Yeah. So we can't do that today. But when

1:51:15.920 --> 1:51:24.160
 I think of black hole, it's a potential treasure chest of understanding the fundamental problems

1:51:24.160 --> 1:51:32.800
 of physics and maybe can give us clues to how we bring to the embarrassment of having

1:51:32.800 --> 1:51:38.960
 two theories of physics together. That's my own romantic idea. What's the worst that could

1:51:38.960 --> 1:51:45.040
 happen? It's so enticing. Just go in and look. Do you think, how far are we away from

1:51:45.040 --> 1:51:50.880
 figuring out the unified theory of physics, the theory of everything? What's your sense?

1:51:50.880 --> 1:52:02.080
 Who will solve it? Like what discipline will solve it? Yeah. I think so little progress

1:52:02.080 --> 1:52:16.080
 has been made without more experimental clues, as I said, that we're just not able to say

1:52:16.080 --> 1:52:26.320
 that we're close without some clues. The most popular theory these days that might lead

1:52:26.320 --> 1:52:34.440
 to that is called string theory. The problem with string theory is it solves a lot of beautiful

1:52:34.440 --> 1:52:46.720
 mathematical problems we have in physics. It's very satisfying theoretically, but it

1:52:46.720 --> 1:52:53.840
 has almost no predictive, maybe no predictive ability because it is a theory that works

1:52:53.840 --> 1:53:02.080
 in 11 dimensions. We live in a physical world of three space and one time dimension. In

1:53:02.080 --> 1:53:08.720
 order to make predictions in our world with string theory, you have to somehow get rid

1:53:08.720 --> 1:53:15.280
 of these other seven dimensions. That's done mathematically by saying they curl up on each

1:53:15.280 --> 1:53:23.400
 other on scales that are too small to affect anything here. That's an okay argument, but

1:53:23.400 --> 1:53:30.320
 how you do that is not unique. That means if I start with that theory and I go to our

1:53:30.320 --> 1:53:37.280
 world here, I can't uniquely go to it. And if I can't, it's not predictive. And that's

1:53:37.280 --> 1:53:42.480
 actually a killer. That's a killer. And string theory is, it seems like from my outsider's

1:53:42.480 --> 1:53:46.920
 perspective has lost favor over the years, perhaps because of this very idea. It's a

1:53:46.920 --> 1:53:52.440
 lack of predictive power. I mean, that science has to connect to something where you make

1:53:52.440 --> 1:53:59.960
 predictions as beautiful as it might be. So I don't think we're close. I think we need

1:53:59.960 --> 1:54:07.520
 some experimental clues. It may be that information on something we don't understand presently

1:54:07.520 --> 1:54:12.680
 at all, like dark energy or probably not dark matter, but dark energy or something might

1:54:12.680 --> 1:54:26.160
 give us some ideas. But I can't envision right now in the short term, meaning the horizon

1:54:26.160 --> 1:54:31.760
 that we can see how we're going to bring these two theories together.

1:54:31.760 --> 1:54:38.560
 A kind of a two part question, maybe just asking the same thing in two different ways.

1:54:38.560 --> 1:54:47.760
 One question is, do you have hope that humans will colonize the galaxy? So expand out, become

1:54:47.760 --> 1:54:53.080
 a multi planetary species. Another way of asking that from a gravitational and a propulsion

1:54:53.080 --> 1:54:57.160
 perspective, do you think we'll come up with ways to travel closer to the speed of light

1:54:57.160 --> 1:55:02.280
 or maybe faster than the speed of light, which would make it a whole heck of a lot easier

1:55:02.280 --> 1:55:06.120
 to expand out into the universe?

1:55:06.120 --> 1:55:17.800
 Yeah. Well, I think that's very futuristic. I think we're not that far from being able

1:55:17.800 --> 1:55:29.720
 to make a one way trip to Mars. That's then a question of whether people are willing to

1:55:29.720 --> 1:55:31.640
 send somebody on a one way trip.

1:55:31.640 --> 1:55:36.840
 Oh, I think they are. There's a lot of the explorers burned bright within our hearts.

1:55:36.840 --> 1:55:37.840
 Yeah, exactly.

1:55:37.840 --> 1:55:42.920
 There's a lot of people willing to die for the opportunity to explore new territory.

1:55:42.920 --> 1:55:51.280
 So this recent landing on Mars is pretty impressive. They have a little helicopter. They're going

1:55:51.280 --> 1:55:57.920
 to fly around. You can imagine in the not too distant future that you could have, I

1:55:57.920 --> 1:56:04.520
 don't think civilizations colonizing, I can envision, but I can envision something more

1:56:04.520 --> 1:56:12.000
 like the South Pole. We haven't colonized Antarctica because it's all ice and cold and

1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:19.000
 so forth. But we have stations. So we have a station that's self sustaining at the South

1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:22.000
 Pole. I've been there. It has.

1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:23.000
 Wow, really?

1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:24.000
 Yeah.

1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:30.080
 What's that like? Because there's parallels there to go to Mars.

1:56:30.080 --> 1:56:31.080
 It's fantastic.

1:56:31.080 --> 1:56:33.480
 What's the journey like?

1:56:33.480 --> 1:56:41.640
 The journey involves going. The South Pole station is run in the US by the National Science

1:56:41.640 --> 1:56:48.160
 Foundation. I went because I was on the National Science Board that runs the National Science

1:56:48.160 --> 1:56:56.120
 Foundation. And so you get a VIP trip if you're healthy enough to the South Pole to see it,

1:56:56.120 --> 1:57:08.840
 which I took. You fly from the US to Australia to Christchurch in Southern Australia. And

1:57:08.840 --> 1:57:13.840
 from there you fly to McMurdo Station, which is on the coast. And it's the station with

1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:20.600
 about a thousand people right on the coast of Antarctica. It's about a seven or eight

1:57:20.600 --> 1:57:28.040
 hour flight and they can't predict the weather. So when I flew from Christchurch to McMurdo

1:57:28.040 --> 1:57:32.980
 Station, they tell you in advance, you do it in a military aircraft, they tell you in

1:57:32.980 --> 1:57:37.840
 advance that they can't predict whether they can land because they have to land on ice.

1:57:37.840 --> 1:57:38.840
 And reassuring.

1:57:38.840 --> 1:57:46.760
 Yeah. And so about halfway the pilot got on and said, sorry, this is a, they call it a

1:57:46.760 --> 1:57:52.360
 boomerang flight. You know, boomerang goes out and goes back. So we had to stay a little

1:57:52.360 --> 1:57:59.560
 while in Christchurch, but then we eventually went to McMurdo Station and then flew to the

1:57:59.560 --> 1:58:07.920
 South Pole. The South Pole itself is, when I was there, it was minus 51 degrees. That

1:58:07.920 --> 1:58:26.840
 was summer. Zero humidity. And it's about 11,000 feet altitude because it's never warm

1:58:26.840 --> 1:58:32.040
 enough for anything to melt. So it doesn't snow very much, but it's about 11,000 feet

1:58:32.040 --> 1:58:41.480
 of snowpack. So you land in a place that's high altitude, cold as could be, and incredibly

1:58:41.480 --> 1:58:52.360
 dry, which means you have a physical adjustment. The place itself is fantastic. They have this

1:58:52.360 --> 1:59:00.320
 great station there. They do astronomy at the South Pole. Nature wise, is it beautiful?

1:59:00.320 --> 1:59:05.160
 What's the experience like? Or is it like visiting any town? No, it's very small. There's

1:59:05.160 --> 1:59:13.120
 only less than a hundred people there. Even when I was there, there were about 50 or 60

1:59:13.120 --> 1:59:18.800
 there. And in the winter, there's less, half of that. Their winter. Yeah. It gets real

1:59:18.800 --> 1:59:28.640
 cold. It gets really cold, yeah. But it's a station. And I think, and that's, I mean,

1:59:28.640 --> 1:59:33.920
 we haven't gone beyond that. On the coast of Antarctica, they have greenhouses and they're

1:59:33.920 --> 1:59:40.840
 self sustaining in McMurdo Station, but we haven't really settled more than that kind

1:59:40.840 --> 1:59:55.440
 of thing in Antarctica, which is a big country or a big plot, a big piece of land. So I don't,

1:59:55.440 --> 2:00:04.640
 I can't envision kind of colonizing at people living so much, as much as I can see the equivalent

2:00:04.640 --> 2:00:10.400
 of the South Pole Station. Well, in the computing world, there's an idea of backing up your

2:00:10.400 --> 2:00:16.520
 data and then you want to do offsite backup, to make sure that if the whole thing burns,

2:00:16.520 --> 2:00:21.520
 if your whole house burns down, that you can have a backup offsite of the data. I think

2:00:21.520 --> 2:00:28.260
 the difference between Antarctica and Mars is Mars is an offsite backup. That if we have

2:00:28.260 --> 2:00:32.800
 nuclear war, whatever the heck might happen here on earth, it'd be nice to have a backup

2:00:32.800 --> 2:00:38.000
 elsewhere. And it'd be nice to have a large enough colony where we sent a variety of people

2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:48.160
 except a few silly astronauts in suits, have an actual vibrant, get a few musicians and

2:00:48.160 --> 2:00:53.920
 artists up there, get a few, maybe like one or two computer scientists, those are essential.

2:00:53.920 --> 2:00:56.320
 Maybe even a physicist, but I'm not sure.

2:00:56.320 --> 2:01:02.200
 Yeah, maybe not. So that comes back to something you talked about earlier, which is the paradox,

2:01:02.200 --> 2:01:10.360
 Fermi's paradox, because you talked about having to escape. And so one number you don't

2:01:10.360 --> 2:01:15.760
 know how to use in Fermi's calculation or Drake, who's done it better, is how long do

2:01:15.760 --> 2:01:24.320
 civilizations last? We've barely gotten to where we can communicate with electricity

2:01:24.320 --> 2:01:28.040
 and magnetism and maybe we'll wipe ourselves out pretty soon.

2:01:28.040 --> 2:01:32.480
 Are you hopeful in general? Like you think we've got another couple of hundred years

2:01:32.480 --> 2:01:35.680
 at least? Or are you worried?

2:01:35.680 --> 2:01:47.480
 Well, no, I'm hopeful, but I don't know if I'm hopeful in the longterm. If you say, are

2:01:47.480 --> 2:01:55.720
 we able to go for another couple of thousand years? I'm not sure. I think we have where

2:01:55.720 --> 2:02:00.760
 we started, the fact that we can do things that don't allow us to kind of keep going

2:02:00.760 --> 2:02:06.560
 or there can be, whether it ends up being a virus that we create or ends up being the

2:02:06.560 --> 2:02:11.480
 equivalent of nuclear war or something else. It's not clear that we can control things

2:02:11.480 --> 2:02:13.120
 well enough.

2:02:13.120 --> 2:02:20.520
 So speaking of really cold conditions and not being hopeful and eventual suffering and

2:02:20.520 --> 2:02:26.120
 destruction of the human species, let me ask you about Russian literature. You mentioned,

2:02:26.120 --> 2:02:30.960
 how's that for transition? I'm doing my best here. You mentioned that you used to love

2:02:30.960 --> 2:02:36.760
 literature when you were younger and you even were hoping to be a writer yourself. That

2:02:36.760 --> 2:02:43.760
 was the motivation. And some of the books I've seen that you listed that were inspiring

2:02:43.760 --> 2:02:52.960
 to you was from Russian literature, like Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Solzhenitsyn. Maybe in general

2:02:52.960 --> 2:02:57.840
 you can speak to your fascination with Russian literature or in general what you picked up

2:02:57.840 --> 2:02:58.840
 from those.

2:02:58.840 --> 2:03:08.320
 I'm not surprised you picked up on the Russian literature, your background, but that's okay.

2:03:08.320 --> 2:03:12.040
 You should be surprised I didn't make the entire conversation about this. That's the

2:03:12.040 --> 2:03:13.040
 real surprise.

2:03:13.040 --> 2:03:24.280
 Yeah. When I didn't really become a physicist or want to go in science until I started college.

2:03:24.280 --> 2:03:29.680
 So when I was younger, I was good at math and that kind of stuff, but I didn't really,

2:03:29.680 --> 2:03:36.400
 I came from a family, nobody went to college and I didn't have any mentors. But I liked

2:03:36.400 --> 2:03:42.440
 to read when I was really young. And so when I was very young, I always carried around

2:03:42.440 --> 2:03:49.280
 a pocket book and read it. And my mother read these mystery stories and I got bored by those

2:03:49.280 --> 2:03:55.500
 eventually. And then I discovered real literature. I don't know what age, but about 12 or 13.

2:03:55.500 --> 2:04:00.640
 And so then I started reading good literature and there's nothing better than Russian literature,

2:04:00.640 --> 2:04:01.640
 of course.

2:04:01.640 --> 2:04:02.640
 Thank you.

2:04:02.640 --> 2:04:16.240
 Reading good literature. So I read quite a bit of Russian literature at that time. And

2:04:16.240 --> 2:04:22.840
 so you asked me about, well, I don't know, I'll say a few words, Dostoevsky. So what

2:04:22.840 --> 2:04:33.200
 about Dostoevsky? For me, Dostoevsky was important in two, I mean, I've read a lot of literature

2:04:33.200 --> 2:04:39.160
 because it's kind of the other thing I do with my life. And he made two incredible,

2:04:39.160 --> 2:04:46.960
 in addition to his own literature, he influenced literature tremendously by having, I don't

2:04:46.960 --> 2:04:53.720
 know how to pronounce polyphony. So he's the first real serious author that had multiple

2:04:53.720 --> 2:05:05.440
 narrators. And he absolutely is the first. And he also was the first, he began existential

2:05:05.440 --> 2:05:12.440
 literature. So the most important book that I've read in the last year when I've been

2:05:12.440 --> 2:05:20.960
 forced to be isolated was existential literature. I decided to reread Camus, The Plague.

2:05:20.960 --> 2:05:23.880
 Oh, yeah. That's a great book.

2:05:23.880 --> 2:05:26.400
 It's a great book and it's right now to read it. It's fantastic.

2:05:26.400 --> 2:05:30.960
 I think that book is about love, actually. Love for humanity.

2:05:30.960 --> 2:05:37.080
 It is, but it has all the, if you haven't read it in recent years, I had read it before,

2:05:37.080 --> 2:05:43.080
 of course, but to read it during this, because it's about a plague. So it's really fantastic

2:05:43.080 --> 2:05:48.000
 to read down. But that reminds me of, he was a great existentialist, but the beginning

2:05:48.000 --> 2:05:50.800
 of existential literature was Dostoevsky.

2:05:50.800 --> 2:05:51.940
 Dostoevsky, yeah.

2:05:51.940 --> 2:06:00.280
 So in addition to his own great novels, he had a tremendous impact on literature.

2:06:00.280 --> 2:06:06.300
 And there's also for Dostoevsky, unlike most other existentialists, he was at least in

2:06:06.300 --> 2:06:12.360
 part religious. I mean, religiosity permeated his idea. I mean, one of my favorite books

2:06:12.360 --> 2:06:16.720
 of his is The Idiot, which is a Christlike figure in there.

2:06:16.720 --> 2:06:19.280
 Well, there's Prince Mishkin, is that his name?

2:06:19.280 --> 2:06:20.280
 Prince Mishkin, yeah.

2:06:20.280 --> 2:06:21.280
 Yeah, Mishkin.

2:06:21.280 --> 2:06:22.280
 Yeah, Mishkin.

2:06:22.280 --> 2:06:23.280
 Yeah.

2:06:23.280 --> 2:06:25.960
 That's one thing about, you read it in English, I presume.

2:06:25.960 --> 2:06:26.960
 Yeah, yeah.

2:06:26.960 --> 2:06:30.500
 Yeah. So the names, that's what gets a lot of people. There's so many names, so hard

2:06:30.500 --> 2:06:35.700
 to pronounce. You have to remember all of them. It's like you have the same problem.

2:06:35.700 --> 2:06:38.320
 But he was a great character.

2:06:38.320 --> 2:06:47.240
 I kind of have a connection with him, because I often, the title of the book, The Idiot,

2:06:47.240 --> 2:06:52.620
 is I kind of, I often call myself an idiot, because that's how I feel. I feel so naive

2:06:52.620 --> 2:06:59.600
 about this world. And I'm not sure, I'm not sure why that is. Maybe it's genetic or so

2:06:59.600 --> 2:07:05.160
 on. But I have a connection, a spiritual connection to that character.

2:07:05.160 --> 2:07:06.160
 To Mishkin.

2:07:06.160 --> 2:07:07.160
 To Mishkin, yeah.

2:07:07.160 --> 2:07:10.160
 But he was far from an idiot.

2:07:10.160 --> 2:07:17.400
 No, in some sense, in some sense. But in another sense, maybe not of this world.

2:07:17.400 --> 2:07:23.020
 In another sense he was. I mean, he was a bumbler, a bunker.

2:07:23.020 --> 2:07:28.160
 But you also mentioned Solzhenitsyn, very interesting.

2:07:28.160 --> 2:07:36.800
 And he always confused me. Of course, he was really, really important in writing about

2:07:36.800 --> 2:07:48.480
 Stalin, and first getting in trouble, and then later he wrote about Stalin in a way,

2:07:48.480 --> 2:07:55.640
 I forget what the book was, in a way that was very critical of Lenin.

2:07:55.640 --> 2:08:00.640
 Yeah, he's evolved through the years, and he actually showed support for Putin eventually.

2:08:00.640 --> 2:08:08.480
 It was a very interesting transition he took, no, journey he took through thinking about

2:08:08.480 --> 2:08:17.920
 Russia and the Soviet Union. But I think what I get from him is basic, it's like Viktor

2:08:17.920 --> 2:08:25.640
 has this man's search for meaning. I have a similar kind of sense of the cruelty of

2:08:25.640 --> 2:08:31.520
 human nature, cruelty of indifference, but also the ability to find happiness in the

2:08:31.520 --> 2:08:37.720
 small joys of life. That's something, there's nothing like a prison camp that makes you

2:08:37.720 --> 2:08:41.760
 realize you could still be happy with a very, very little.

2:08:41.760 --> 2:08:50.160
 Yeah, his description of how to go through a day and actually enjoy it in a prison camp

2:08:50.160 --> 2:08:56.760
 is pretty amazing. And some prison camp, it's the worst of the worst.

2:08:56.760 --> 2:09:09.440
 And also, I do think about the role of authoritarian states in hopeful idealistic systems somehow

2:09:09.440 --> 2:09:16.760
 leading to the suffering of millions. And this might be arguable, but I think a lot

2:09:16.760 --> 2:09:24.240
 of people believe that Stalin, I think, genuinely believed that he's doing good for the world.

2:09:24.240 --> 2:09:32.280
 And he wasn't. It's a very valuable lesson that even evil people think they're doing

2:09:32.280 --> 2:09:38.360
 good. Otherwise, it's too difficult to do the evil. The best way to do evil is to believe

2:09:38.360 --> 2:09:44.000
 about framing it in a way like you're doing good. And then this is a very clear picture

2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:53.400
 of that, which is the gulags. And Solzhenitsyn is one of the best people to reveal that.

2:09:53.400 --> 2:09:58.880
 The most recent thing I read, it isn't actually fiction, was the woman, I can't remember

2:09:58.880 --> 2:10:04.280
 her name, who got the Nobel Prize about within the last five years. I don't know whether

2:10:04.280 --> 2:10:09.840
 she's Ukrainian or Russian, but there are interviews. Have you read that?

2:10:09.840 --> 2:10:12.680
 Interview of Ukrainian survivors of...

2:10:12.680 --> 2:10:18.560
 Well, I think she may be originally Ukrainian. The book's written in Russian and translated

2:10:18.560 --> 2:10:23.920
 in English, and many of the interviews are in Moscow and places. But she won the Nobel

2:10:23.920 --> 2:10:31.080
 Prize within the last five years or so. But what's interesting is that these are people

2:10:31.080 --> 2:10:39.040
 of all different ages, all different occupations and so forth, and they're reflecting on their

2:10:39.040 --> 2:10:45.560
 reaction to basically the present Soviet system, the system they lived with before.

2:10:45.560 --> 2:10:57.400
 There's a lot of looking back by a lot of them with, well, it being much better before.

2:10:57.400 --> 2:11:05.680
 Yeah. I don't know what... In America, we think we know the right answer, what it means

2:11:05.680 --> 2:11:11.440
 to be, to build a better world. I'm not so sure. I think we're all just trying to figure

2:11:11.440 --> 2:11:12.440
 it out.

2:11:12.440 --> 2:11:13.440
 Yeah, there's...

2:11:13.440 --> 2:11:14.440
 We're doing our best.

2:11:14.440 --> 2:11:17.600
 I think you're right.

2:11:17.600 --> 2:11:23.760
 Is there advice you can give to young people today, besides reading Russian literature

2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:29.920
 at a young age, about how to find their way in life, how to find success in Korea or just

2:11:29.920 --> 2:11:37.080
 life in general?

2:11:37.080 --> 2:11:43.080
 My own belief, it may not be very deep, but I believe it. I think you should follow your

2:11:43.080 --> 2:11:48.600
 dreams and you should have dreams and follow your dreams if you can, to the extent that

2:11:48.600 --> 2:11:55.800
 you can. And we spend a lot of our time doing something with ourselves. In my case, physics,

2:11:55.800 --> 2:12:04.720
 in your case, I don't know, whatever it is, machine learning and this. Yeah, you should

2:12:04.720 --> 2:12:05.720
 have fun.

2:12:05.720 --> 2:12:12.120
 What was... Wait, wait, wait. Follow your dreams. What dream did you have? Because there's...

2:12:12.120 --> 2:12:14.720
 Well, originally, I was...

2:12:14.720 --> 2:12:16.720
 Because you didn't follow your dream. I thought you were supposed to be a writer.

2:12:16.720 --> 2:12:20.400
 I changed along the way. I was gonna be, but I changed.

2:12:20.400 --> 2:12:21.400
 What happened?

2:12:21.400 --> 2:12:28.460
 That was... What happened? Oh, I read... I decided to take the most serious literature

2:12:28.460 --> 2:12:34.800
 course in my high school, which was a mistake. I'd probably be a second rate writer now.

2:12:34.800 --> 2:12:35.800
 And...

2:12:35.800 --> 2:12:37.520
 Could be a Nobel Prize winning writer.

2:12:37.520 --> 2:12:50.080
 And the book that we read, even though I had read Russian novels, I was 15, I think, cured

2:12:50.080 --> 2:12:53.080
 me from being a novelist.

2:12:53.080 --> 2:12:54.080
 Destroyed your dream?

2:12:54.080 --> 2:12:55.080
 Yes.

2:12:55.080 --> 2:12:56.800
 Cured you. Okay. What was the book?

2:12:56.800 --> 2:12:57.800
 Moby Dick.

2:12:57.800 --> 2:12:58.800
 Okay.

2:12:58.800 --> 2:13:00.360
 So, why Moby Dick?

2:13:00.360 --> 2:13:01.360
 Yeah, why?

2:13:01.360 --> 2:13:07.680
 So, I've read it since, and it's a great novel. Maybe it's as good as the Russian novels.

2:13:07.680 --> 2:13:11.280
 I've never made it through. It was too boring. It was too long.

2:13:11.280 --> 2:13:14.400
 Okay. Your words are gonna mesh with what I say.

2:13:14.400 --> 2:13:15.400
 Excellent.

2:13:15.400 --> 2:13:17.880
 And you may have the same problem at older ages.

2:13:17.880 --> 2:13:19.520
 That's why I'm not a writer.

2:13:19.520 --> 2:13:27.120
 It may be. So, the problem is, Moby Dick is... What I remember was there was a chapter that

2:13:27.120 --> 2:13:34.080
 was maybe 100 pages long, all describing this, why there was Ahab and the white whale, and

2:13:34.080 --> 2:13:39.520
 it was the battle between Ahab with his wooden peg leg and the white whale.

2:13:39.520 --> 2:13:43.460
 And there was a chapter that was 100 pages long in my memory, I don't know how long it

2:13:43.460 --> 2:13:49.960
 really was, that described in detail, though, great white whale and what he was doing and

2:13:49.960 --> 2:13:52.360
 what his fins were like and this and that.

2:13:52.360 --> 2:13:58.280
 And it was so incredibly boring, the word you used, that I thought, if this is great

2:13:58.280 --> 2:14:00.280
 literature, screw it.

2:14:00.280 --> 2:14:01.280
 Fascinating.

2:14:01.280 --> 2:14:06.800
 Okay. And now, why did I have a problem? I know now in reflection, because I still read

2:14:06.800 --> 2:14:18.600
 a lot, and I read that novel after I was 30 or 40 years old, and the problem was simple.

2:14:18.600 --> 2:14:25.600
 I diagnosed what the problem was. That novel, in contrast to the Russian novels, which are

2:14:25.600 --> 2:14:32.960
 very realistic and point of view, is one huge metaphor.

2:14:32.960 --> 2:14:37.200
 At 15 years old, I probably didn't know the word, and I certainly didn't know the meaning

2:14:37.200 --> 2:14:38.200
 of metaphor.

2:14:38.200 --> 2:14:42.160
 Yeah, like, why do I care about a fish? Why are you telling me all about this fish?

2:14:42.160 --> 2:14:47.600
 Exactly. It's one big metaphor. So, reading it later as a metaphor, I could really enjoy

2:14:47.600 --> 2:14:51.480
 it. But the teacher gave me the wrong book, or maybe it was the right book because I went

2:14:51.480 --> 2:14:59.320
 into physics. But it was truly, I think, I may oversimplify, but it was really that I

2:14:59.320 --> 2:15:04.360
 was too young to read that book. Not too young to read the Russian novels, interestingly,

2:15:04.360 --> 2:15:08.840
 but too young to read that because I probably didn't even know the word, and I certainly

2:15:08.840 --> 2:15:10.800
 didn't understand it as a metaphor.

2:15:10.800 --> 2:15:15.400
 Well, in terms of fish, I recommend people read Old Man and the Sea, much shorter, much

2:15:15.400 --> 2:15:21.920
 better. It's still a metaphor, though. But you can read it just as a story about a guy

2:15:21.920 --> 2:15:29.560
 catching a fish, and it's still fun to read. I had the same experience as you, not with

2:15:29.560 --> 2:15:34.640
 Moby Dick, but later in college, I took a course on James Joyce. Don't ask me why. I

2:15:34.640 --> 2:15:38.980
 was majoring in computer science, I took a course on James Joyce. And I was kept being

2:15:38.980 --> 2:15:46.640
 told that he is widely considered, by many considered, to be the greatest literary writer

2:15:46.640 --> 2:15:52.520
 of the 20th century. And I kept reading, I think, so his short story is The Dead, I think

2:15:52.520 --> 2:15:57.360
 it's called. It was very good. Well, not very good, but pretty good. And then Ulysses.

2:15:57.360 --> 2:15:58.360
 It's actually very good.

2:15:58.360 --> 2:16:02.640
 It is very good. Only The Dead, the final story, it still rings with me today. But then

2:16:02.640 --> 2:16:09.400
 Ulysses was, I got through Ulysses with the help of some Cliff Notes and so on. And so

2:16:09.400 --> 2:16:14.760
 I did Ulysses and then Finnegan's Wake. The moment I started Finnegan's Wake, I said,

2:16:14.760 --> 2:16:22.440
 this is stupid. That's when I went full into like, I don't know, that's when I went full

2:16:22.440 --> 2:16:28.480
 Kafka, Bukowski, like people who just talk about the darkness of the human condition

2:16:28.480 --> 2:16:36.520
 in the fewest words possible and without any of the music of language. So it was a turning

2:16:36.520 --> 2:16:45.200
 point as well. I wonder when is the right time to appreciate the beauty of language.

2:16:45.200 --> 2:16:49.040
 Like even Shakespeare. I was very much off put by Shakespeare in high school and only

2:16:49.040 --> 2:16:55.440
 later I started to appreciate its value in the same way. Let me ask you a ridiculous

2:16:55.440 --> 2:17:04.640
 question. Okay. I mean, because you've read Russian literature, let me ask this one last

2:17:04.640 --> 2:17:10.560
 question. I might be lying. There might be a couple more, but what do you think is the

2:17:10.560 --> 2:17:17.980
 meaning of this whole thing? You got a Nobel prize for looking out into the, trying to

2:17:17.980 --> 2:17:24.800
 reach back into the beginning of the universe, listening to the gravitational waves, but

2:17:24.800 --> 2:17:33.840
 that still doesn't answer the why. Why are we here? Beyond just the matter and anti matter,

2:17:33.840 --> 2:17:35.360
 the philosophical question.

2:17:35.360 --> 2:17:42.960
 The philosophical question about the meaning of life, I'm probably not really good at.

2:17:42.960 --> 2:17:56.600
 I think that the individual meaning, I would say it rather simplistically is whether you've

2:17:56.600 --> 2:18:05.160
 made a difference, a positive difference, I'd say for anything besides yourself. Meaning

2:18:05.160 --> 2:18:11.340
 you could have been important to other people or you could have discovered gravitational

2:18:11.340 --> 2:18:16.300
 waves that matters to other people or something, but something beyond just existing on the

2:18:16.300 --> 2:18:27.440
 earth as an individual. So your life has meaning if you have affected either knowledge or people

2:18:27.440 --> 2:18:35.960
 or something beyond yourself. It's a simplistic statement, but it's about as good as I can

2:18:35.960 --> 2:18:46.480
 say. In all of its simplicity, it may be very true. Does it make you sad that this ride

2:18:46.480 --> 2:18:55.360
 ends? Do you think about your mortality? Are you afraid of it?

2:18:55.360 --> 2:19:06.520
 Not exactly afraid of it, but saddened by it. I'm old enough to know that I've lived

2:19:06.520 --> 2:19:14.960
 most of my life and I enjoy being alive. I can imagine being sick and not wanting to

2:19:14.960 --> 2:19:17.560
 be alive, but I'm not.

2:19:17.560 --> 2:19:23.040
 It's been a good ride.

2:19:23.040 --> 2:19:35.720
 I'm not happy to see it come to an end. I'd like to see it prolong, but I don't fear the

2:19:35.720 --> 2:19:44.320
 dying itself or that kind of thing. It's more, I'd like to prolong what is I think a good

2:19:44.320 --> 2:19:51.240
 life that I'm living and still living.

2:19:51.240 --> 2:20:01.600
 It's sad to think that the finiteness of it is the thing that makes it special. And also

2:20:01.600 --> 2:20:08.520
 sad to me, at least it's kind of, I don't think I'm using too strong of a word, but

2:20:08.520 --> 2:20:15.960
 it's kind of terrifying the uncertainty of it. The mystery of it, the mystery of death.

2:20:15.960 --> 2:20:20.120
 The mystery of it, yeah, of death. When we're talking about the mystery of black holes that's

2:20:20.120 --> 2:20:25.120
 somehow distant, that's somehow out there and the mystery of our own.

2:20:25.120 --> 2:20:31.400
 But even life, the mystery of consciousness, I find so hard to deal with too. I mean, it's

2:20:31.400 --> 2:20:37.640
 not as painful. I mean, we're conscious, but the whole magic of life we can understand,

2:20:37.640 --> 2:20:43.560
 but consciousness where we can actually think and so forth. It's pretty.

2:20:43.560 --> 2:20:48.520
 It seems like such a beautiful gift that it really sucks that we get to let go of it.

2:20:48.520 --> 2:20:54.080
 We have to let go of it. What do you hope your legacy is? As I'm sure they will. Aliens

2:20:54.080 --> 2:20:59.320
 when they visit and humans have destroyed all of human civilization. Aliens read about

2:20:59.320 --> 2:21:03.520
 you in an encyclopedia that we'll leave behind. What do you hope it says?

2:21:03.520 --> 2:21:12.280
 Well, I would hope they, to the extent that they evaluated me, felt that I helped move

2:21:12.280 --> 2:21:22.520
 science forward as a tangible contribution and that I served as a good role model for

2:21:22.520 --> 2:21:25.680
 how humans should live their lives.

2:21:25.680 --> 2:21:31.840
 And we're part of creating one of the most incredible things humans have ever created.

2:21:31.840 --> 2:21:36.920
 So yes, there's the science. That's the Fermi thing, right?

2:21:36.920 --> 2:21:38.240
 And the instrument, I guess.

2:21:38.240 --> 2:21:43.960
 And the instrument. The instrument is a magical creation, not just by a human, by a collection

2:21:43.960 --> 2:21:58.720
 of humans. The collaboration is, that's humanity at its best. I do hope we last quite a bit

2:21:58.720 --> 2:22:05.560
 longer, but if we don't, this is a good thing to remember humans by. At least they built

2:22:05.560 --> 2:22:10.320
 that thing. That's pretty impressive. Barry, this is an amazing conversation. Thank you

2:22:10.320 --> 2:22:14.840
 so much for wasting your time and explaining so many things so well. I appreciate your

2:22:14.840 --> 2:22:15.840
 time today.

2:22:15.840 --> 2:22:17.960
 Thank you.

2:22:17.960 --> 2:22:22.760
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Barry Barish. To support this podcast,

 please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

2:22:28.280 --> 2:22:35.840
 Werner Heisenberg, a theoretical physicist and one of the key pioneers of quantum mechanics.

2:22:35.840 --> 2:22:43.500
 Not only is the universe stranger than we think, it is stranger than we can think. Thank

2:22:43.500 --> 2:22:58.640
 you for listening and hope to see you next time.
