00:00.000 --> 00:04.560
 remember George Washington? You know how he died? Well meaning physicians bled him to death,

00:04.560 --> 00:09.840
 and this was the most important patient in the country, maybe in the history of the country,

00:10.800 --> 00:17.200
 and we bled him to death trying to help him. So when you're actually inflating the money supply

00:17.200 --> 00:24.160
 at 7% but you're calling it 2% because you want to help the economy, you're literally bleeding

00:24.160 --> 00:31.040
 the free market to death. But the sad fact is George Washington went along with it because he

00:31.040 --> 00:38.000
 thought that they were going to do him good, and the majority of the society, most companies,

00:38.720 --> 00:46.400
 most conventional thinkers, you know, the working class, they go along with this because they think

00:46.400 --> 00:50.880
 that someone has their best interest of mind, and the people that are bleeding them to death

00:50.880 --> 00:56.400
 believe, they believe that prescription because their mental models are just so defective.

00:58.800 --> 01:03.280
 The following is a conversation with Michael Saylor, one of the most prominent and brilliant

01:03.280 --> 01:10.080
 Bitcoin proponents in the world. He is the CEO of MicroStrategy, founder of Saylor Academy,

01:10.080 --> 01:16.640
 graduate of MIT, and Michael is one of the most fascinating and rigorous thinkers I've ever gotten

01:16.640 --> 01:21.840
 a chance to explore ideas with. He can effortlessly zoom out to the big perspectives of human

01:21.840 --> 01:28.640
 civilization and human history, and zoom back in to the technical details of blockchains, markets,

01:28.640 --> 01:34.240
 governments, and financial systems. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it,

01:34.240 --> 01:40.560
 please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Michael Saylor.

01:40.560 --> 01:49.120
 Here's Michael Saylor. Let's start with a big question of truth and wisdom. When advanced humans

01:49.120 --> 01:54.320
 or aliens or AI systems, let's say five to ten centuries from now, look back at Earth

01:55.280 --> 02:01.360
 on this early 21st century, how much do you think they would say we understood about

02:02.320 --> 02:07.200
 money and economics, or even about engineering, science, life, death, meaning, intelligence,

02:07.200 --> 02:11.440
 consciousness, all the big interesting questions?

02:12.160 --> 02:15.680
 I think they would probably give us a

02:17.840 --> 02:22.960
 B minus on engineering, on all the engineering things, the hard sciences.

02:22.960 --> 02:23.840
 A passing grade.

02:24.720 --> 02:30.160
 Like, we're doing okay. We're working our way through rockets and jets and electric cars and

02:30.160 --> 02:39.360
 an electricity transport systems and nuclear power and space flight and the like. And if you look at

02:39.360 --> 02:47.840
 the walls that grace the great court at MIT, it's full of all the great thinkers and they're all

02:47.840 --> 02:57.920
 pretty admirable. If you could be with Newton or Gauss or Madame Curie or Einstein, you would

02:57.920 --> 03:08.000
 respect them. I would say they'd give us like a D minus on economics, like an F plus or a D minus.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.520
 You have an optimistic vision. First of all, optimistic vision of engineering,

03:12.080 --> 03:17.120
 because everybody you've listed, not everybody, but most people you've listed is just over the

03:17.120 --> 03:23.040
 past couple of centuries. And maybe it stretches a little farther back, but mostly all the cool

03:23.040 --> 03:25.680
 stuff we've done in engineering is the past couple of centuries.

03:25.680 --> 03:34.480
 I mean, Archimedes had his virtues. I studied the history of science at MIT and I also studied

03:34.480 --> 03:40.720
 aerospace engineering. And so I clearly have a bias in favor of science. And if I look at the

03:40.720 --> 03:47.760
 past 10,000 years and I consider all of the philosophy and the politics and their impact

03:47.760 --> 03:53.360
 on the human condition, I think it's a wash for every politician that came up with a good idea,

03:53.360 --> 03:59.920
 another politician came up with a bad idea. And it's not clear to me that most of the

03:59.920 --> 04:06.880
 political and philosophical contributions to the human race and the human conditions

04:06.880 --> 04:13.680
 have advanced so much. I mean, we're still taking guidance and admiring Aristotle and

04:13.680 --> 04:22.320
 Plato and Seneca and the like. And on the other hand, if you think about what has made the human

04:22.320 --> 04:33.520
 condition better, fire, water, harnessing of wind energy, try to row across an ocean, right?

04:33.520 --> 04:34.080
 Not easy.

04:34.080 --> 04:39.680
 And for people who are just listening or watching, there's a beautiful sexy ship from

04:40.320 --> 04:42.080
 16th, 17th century.

04:42.080 --> 04:48.960
 This is a 19th century handmade model of a 17th century sailing ship, which is of the type that

04:48.960 --> 04:56.720
 the Dutch East India's company used to sail the world and trade. So that was made, the original

04:56.720 --> 05:04.320
 was made sometime in the 1600s. And then this model is made in the 19th century by individuals.

05:04.320 --> 05:08.240
 So both the model and the ship itself is engineering at its best. And just imagine,

05:08.240 --> 05:12.000
 just like rockets flying out to space, how much hope this filled people with,

05:12.000 --> 05:19.520
 exploring the unknown, going into the mystery, both the entrepreneurs and the business people

05:19.520 --> 05:24.320
 and the engineers and just humans. What's out there? What's out there to be discovered?

05:24.320 --> 05:29.440
 Yeah, the metaphor of human beings leaving shore or sailing across the horizon,

05:29.440 --> 05:33.520
 risking their lives in pursuit of a better life is an incredibly powerful one.

05:33.520 --> 05:41.200
 In 1900, I suppose the average life expectancy is 50. During the Revolutionary War,

05:42.000 --> 05:47.680
 while our founding fathers were fighting to establish life, liberty, pursuit of happiness,

05:47.680 --> 05:54.240
 the Constitution, average life expectancy is like 32, somewhere between 32 and 36.

05:54.880 --> 06:01.120
 So all the sound and the fury doesn't make you live past 32, but what does, right? Antibiotics.

06:01.120 --> 06:09.120
 Conquest of infectious diseases. If we understand the science of infectious disease, sterilizing

06:09.760 --> 06:15.680
 a knife and harnessing antibiotics gets you from 50 to 70. And that happened fast, right? That

06:15.680 --> 06:24.720
 happens from 1900 to 1950 or something like that. And I think if you look at the human condition,

06:24.720 --> 06:30.080
 you ever get on one of those rowing machines where they actually keep track of your watts output when

06:30.080 --> 06:39.920
 you're on that? Yeah. It's like 200 is a lot. Okay, 200 is a lot. So a kilowatt hour is like all

06:39.920 --> 06:48.160
 the energy that a human, a trained athlete can deliver in a day. And probably not 1% of the

06:48.160 --> 06:54.160
 people in the world could deliver a kilowatt hour in a day. And the commercial value of a kilowatt

06:54.160 --> 07:03.760
 hour, the retail value is 11 cents today. And the wholesale value is 2 cents. And so you have to look

07:03.760 --> 07:12.320
 at the contribution of politicians and philosophers and economists to the human condition. And it's

07:12.320 --> 07:17.680
 like at best a wash one way or the other. And then if you look at the contribution of John D.

07:17.680 --> 07:25.840
 Rockefeller when he delivered you a barrel of oil and the energy in oil, liquid energy, or the

07:25.840 --> 07:34.880
 contribution of Tesla as we deliver electricity. And what's the impact on the human condition if I

07:34.880 --> 07:43.360
 have electric power, if I have chemical power, if I have wind energy, if I can actually set up a

07:43.360 --> 07:51.120
 reservoir, create a dam, spend a turbine, and generate energy from a hydraulic source?

07:52.160 --> 08:00.400
 That's extraordinary, right? And so our ability to cross the ocean, our ability to grow food,

08:00.400 --> 08:09.360
 our ability to live, it's technology that gets the human race from a brutal life where life

08:09.360 --> 08:14.400
 expectancy is 30 to a world where life expectancy is 80.

08:14.400 --> 08:20.480
 You gave a D minus to the economists. So are they too like the politicians a wash

08:20.960 --> 08:26.960
 in terms of there's good ideas and bad ideas and that tiny delta between good and bad?

08:26.960 --> 08:31.440
 Is how you squeak past the F plus onto the D minus territory?

08:31.440 --> 08:34.720
 I think most economic ideas are bad ideas.

08:34.720 --> 08:35.280
 Most.

08:35.280 --> 08:43.840
 You know, like take us back to MIT and you want to solve a fluid dynamics problem. Like design

08:43.840 --> 08:50.240
 the shape of the hull of that ship, or you want to design an airfoil, a wing, or if you want to

08:50.240 --> 08:59.120
 design an engine or a nozzle in a rocket ship, you wouldn't do it with simple arithmetic.

08:59.760 --> 09:04.160
 You wouldn't do it with a scaler. There's not a single number, right? It's vector math.

09:04.160 --> 09:10.480
 You know, computational fluid dynamics is n dimensional, higher level math,

09:10.480 --> 09:15.920
 you know, complicated stuff. So when an economist says the inflation rate is

09:15.920 --> 09:22.800
 2%, that's a scaler. And when an economist says it's not a problem to print more money,

09:22.800 --> 09:28.720
 because the velocity of the money is very low, monetary velocity is low, that's another scaler.

09:29.680 --> 09:37.600
 Okay, so the truth of the matter is inflation is not a scaler. Inflation is an n dimensional vector.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.800
 Money velocity is not a scaler.

09:40.800 --> 09:49.920
 The saying, what's the velocity of money? Oh, it's slow or it's fast. It ignores the question of

09:49.920 --> 09:56.400
 what medium is the money moving through. And the same way that, you know, what's the speed of sound?

09:57.360 --> 10:05.360
 Okay, well, what is sound, right? Sound, you know, sound is a compression wave. It's energy

10:05.360 --> 10:11.120
 moving through a medium, but the speed is different. So for example, the speed of sound through air is

10:11.120 --> 10:16.000
 different than the speed of sound through water. And sound moves faster through water,

10:16.000 --> 10:21.040
 it moves faster through a solid, and it moves faster to a stiffer solid. So there isn't one.

10:21.840 --> 10:26.640
 What is the fundamental problem with the way economists reduce the world down to a model?

10:26.640 --> 10:30.560
 Is it too simple? Or is it just even the first generation?

10:30.560 --> 10:37.840
 I think that the fundamental problem is, if you see the world as a scaler, you simply pick

10:38.400 --> 10:46.320
 the one number which is, which supports whatever you want to do, and you ignore the universe of

10:46.320 --> 10:53.440
 other consequences from your behavior. In general, I don't know if you've heard of the

10:53.440 --> 11:01.120
 Eric Weisen has been talking about this with gauge theory. So different kinds of approaches

11:01.120 --> 11:08.800
 from the physics world, from the mathematical world to extend past this scaler view of economics.

11:08.800 --> 11:15.840
 So gauge theory is one way that comes from physics. Do you find that a way of exploring economics

11:15.840 --> 11:19.440
 interesting? So outside of cryptocurrency, outside of the actual technology,

11:19.440 --> 11:24.000
 and so on, just analysis of how economics works. Do you find that interesting?

11:26.000 --> 11:31.360
 Yeah, I think that if we're going to want to really make any scientific progress in economics,

11:31.360 --> 11:38.000
 we have to apply much, much more computationally intensive and richer forms of mathematics.

11:38.560 --> 11:40.720
 So simulation, perhaps, or?

11:40.720 --> 11:45.760
 Yeah, you know, when I was at MIT, I studied system dynamics at MIT.

11:45.760 --> 11:50.800
 You know, when I was at MIT, I studied system dynamics. You know, they taught it at the Sloan

11:50.800 --> 11:58.720
 School. It was developed by Jay Forrester, who was an extraordinary computer scientist.

11:59.280 --> 12:08.400
 And when we created models of economic behavior, they were all multi dimensional nonlinear models.

12:08.400 --> 12:14.320
 So if you want to describe how anything works in the real world, you have to start with the concept

12:14.320 --> 12:22.160
 of feedback. If I double the price of something, demand will fall, and attempts to create supply

12:22.160 --> 12:28.720
 will increase, and there will be a delay before the capacity increases. There'll be an instant

12:28.720 --> 12:34.400
 demand change, and there'll be rippling effects throughout every other segment of the economy,

12:34.400 --> 12:40.720
 downstream and upstream of such a thing. So it's kind of common sense. But most economics,

12:40.720 --> 12:45.280
 most classical economics, it's always, you know, taught with linear models,

12:46.080 --> 12:51.840
 you know, fairly simplistic linear models. And oftentimes, even I'm really shocked today

12:52.720 --> 13:00.000
 that the entire mainstream dialogue of economics has been captured by scale or arithmetic.

13:00.640 --> 13:06.880
 For example, if you read, you know, read any article in New York Times or the Wall Street

13:06.880 --> 13:12.720
 Journal, right, they just refer to there's an inflation number or the CPI or the inflation

13:12.720 --> 13:20.560
 rate is X. And if you look at all the historic studies of the impact of inflation, generally,

13:20.560 --> 13:27.840
 they're all based upon the idea that inflation equals CPI, and then they try to extrapolate from

13:27.840 --> 13:35.760
 that and you just get nowhere with it. So at the very least, we should be considering inflation

13:35.760 --> 13:42.080
 and other economics concept as a nonlinear dynamical system. So nonlinearity, and also

13:42.080 --> 13:46.960
 just embracing the full complexity of just how the variables interact, maybe through simulation,

13:46.960 --> 13:49.920
 maybe some have some interesting models around that.

13:49.920 --> 13:55.680
 Wouldn't it be refreshing if somebody for once published a table of the change in price of every

13:55.680 --> 14:00.400
 product, every service, and every asset in every place over time?

14:00.400 --> 14:06.160
 LR You said table, some of that also is the task of visualization, how to extract from

14:06.160 --> 14:14.160
 this complex set of numbers, patterns that somehow indicate something fundamental about

14:14.160 --> 14:19.760
 what's happening. So like, summarization of data is still important, perhaps summarization,

14:19.760 --> 14:27.040
 not down to a single scale of value. But looking at that whole sea of numbers, you have to find

14:27.040 --> 14:33.680
 patterns, like what is inflation in a particular sector? What is maybe change over time, maybe

14:33.680 --> 14:38.640
 different geographical regions, you know, things of that nature. I think that's kind of,

14:38.640 --> 14:43.120
 I don't know even what that task is. You know, that's what you could look at machine learning,

14:43.120 --> 14:49.360
 you can look at AI with that perspective, which is like, how do you represent what's happening

14:49.360 --> 14:54.400
 efficiently, as efficiently as possible? That's never going to be a single number, but it might

14:54.400 --> 14:58.720
 be a compressed model that captures something, something beautiful, something fundamental

14:58.720 --> 14:59.760
 about what's happening.

15:00.320 --> 15:09.840
 It's an opportunity, for sure, right? You know, if we take, for example, during the

15:09.840 --> 15:18.720
 pandemic, the response of the political apparatus was to lower interest rates to zero, and to

15:18.720 --> 15:25.200
 start buying assets, in essence, printing money. And the defense was, there's no inflation.

15:26.720 --> 15:33.120
 But of course, you had one part of the economy where it was locked down, so it was illegal

15:33.120 --> 15:41.120
 to buy anything. It was either illegal or it was impractical. So it would be impossible

15:41.120 --> 15:45.920
 for demand to manifest, so of course, there is no inflation. On the other hand, there

15:45.920 --> 15:53.840
 was instantaneous immediate inflation in another part of the economy. For example, you lower

15:53.840 --> 15:59.520
 the interest rates to zero. At one point, we saw the swap rate on a 30 year note go

15:59.520 --> 16:07.040
 to 72 basis points. Okay, that means that the value of a long dated bond immediately

16:07.040 --> 15:49.440
 inflates. So the bond market had hyperinflation within minutes of these

15:49.440 --> 15:55.680
 financial decisions. The asset market had hyperinflation within minutes of these

15:59.520 --> 16:00.560
 financial decisions.

16:01.360 --> 16:13.240
 So here again, it's about how we insights whether the market will

16:13.240 --> 16:17.840
 react to the hyperinflation within minutes of these financial decisions.

16:17.840 --> 16:24.000
 asset market had hyperinflation. We had what you call a K shape recovery, what we affectionately

16:24.000 --> 16:29.920
 call a K shape recovery. Main Street shut down, Wall Street recovered all within six weeks.

16:30.800 --> 16:38.640
 The inflation was in the assets, like in the stocks, in the bonds. If you look today, you see

16:38.640 --> 16:48.320
 that a typical house, according to the Case Shiller Index today, is up 19.2% year over year. So if

16:48.320 --> 16:56.720
 you're a first time home buyer, the inflation rate is 19%. The formal CPI announced a 7.9%.

16:58.880 --> 17:05.840
 You can pretty much create any inflation rate you want by constructing a market basket,

17:05.840 --> 17:12.240
 a weighted basket of products or services or assets that yield you the answer. I think that

17:13.680 --> 17:21.840
 the fundamental failing of economists is, first of all, they don't really have a term for asset

17:21.840 --> 17:29.200
 inflation. What's an asset? What's asset hyperinflation? You mentioned bond market swap

17:29.200 --> 17:35.920
 rate and asset is where the majority of the hyperinflation happen. What's inflation? What's

17:35.920 --> 17:40.720
 hyperinflation? What's an asset? What's an asset market? I'm going to ask so many dumb questions.

17:40.720 --> 17:48.400
 In the conventional economic world, you would treat inflation as the rate of increase in

17:48.400 --> 17:54.000
 price of a market basket of consumer products defined by a government agency.

17:54.000 --> 18:00.240
 LW. So they have like traditional things that a regular consumer would be buying.

18:01.040 --> 18:06.160
 The government selects like toilet paper, food, toaster,

18:06.960 --> 18:11.120
 refrigerator, electronics, all that kind of stuff. And it's like a representative

18:12.320 --> 18:19.280
 basket of goods that lead to a content existence on this earth for a regular consumer.

18:19.280 --> 18:25.200
 CM. They define a synthetic metric, right? I mean, I'm going to say you should have a thousand

18:25.200 --> 18:32.480
 square foot apartment and you should have a used car and you should eat three hamburgers a week.

18:33.040 --> 18:40.560
 Now, 10 years go by and the apartment costs more, I could adjust the market basket by a,

18:40.560 --> 18:45.200
 they call them hedonic adjustments. I could decide that it used to be in 1970 you needed

18:45.200 --> 18:50.720
 a thousand square feet, but in the year 2020, you only need 700 square feet because we've

18:51.280 --> 18:56.880
 miniaturized televisions and we've got more efficient electric appliances and because

18:56.880 --> 19:02.000
 things have collapsed out of the iPhone, you just don't need as much space. So now I, you know,

19:02.000 --> 19:07.360
 it may be that the apartment costs 50% more, but after the hedonic adjustment, there is no inflation

19:07.360 --> 19:11.520
 because I just downgraded the expectation of what a normal person should have.

19:11.520 --> 19:16.400
 TG. So the synthetic nature of the metric allows for manipulation by people in power?

19:16.400 --> 19:24.720
 CM. Pretty much. I guess my criticism of economists is rather than embracing inflation

19:25.840 --> 19:31.600
 based upon its fundamental idea, which is the rate at which the price of things go up, right?

19:31.600 --> 19:40.560
 They've been captured by mainstream conventional thinking to immediately equate inflation to the

19:40.560 --> 19:47.840
 government issued CPI or government issued PCE or government issued PPI measure, which was never the

19:47.840 --> 19:55.040
 rate at which things go up. It's simply the rate at which a synthetic basket of products and

19:55.040 --> 20:00.480
 services the government wishes to track go up. Now, the problem with that is that the

20:00.480 --> 20:08.640
 problem with that is two big things. One thing is the government gets to create the market basket,

20:08.640 --> 20:16.960
 and so they keep changing what's in the basket over time. So I mean, if I said three years ago,

20:16.960 --> 20:22.000
 you should go see 10 concerts a year and the concert tickets now cost $200 each. Now it's

20:22.000 --> 20:28.640
 $2,000 a year to go see concerts. Now I'm in charge of calculating inflation. So I redefine,

20:28.640 --> 20:33.440
 you know, your entertainment quota for the year to be eight Netflix streaming concerts,

20:33.440 --> 20:37.680
 and now they don't cost $2,000. They cost nothing, and there is no inflation,

20:37.680 --> 20:44.240
 but you don't get your concerts, right? So the problem starts with continually changing

20:44.240 --> 20:49.840
 the definition of the market basket. But in my opinion, that's not the biggest problem.

20:49.840 --> 21:00.000
 The more egregious problem is the fundamental idea that assets aren't products or services.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.600
 Assets can't be inflated. What's an asset?

21:03.600 --> 21:15.280
 A house, a share of Apple stock, a bond, a Bitcoin is an asset, or a Picasso painting.

21:15.280 --> 21:22.400
 LW. Not a consumable good. Not an Apple that you can eat.

21:22.400 --> 21:30.160
 RL. Right. If I throw away an asset, then I'm not on the hook to track the inflation rate for it.

21:30.160 --> 21:35.520
 So what happens if I change the policy such that, let's take the classic example,

21:35.520 --> 21:40.960
 a million dollar bond at a 5% interest rate gives you $50,000 a year in risk free income.

21:40.960 --> 21:47.760
 You might retire on $50,000 a year in a low cost jurisdiction. So the cost of social security

21:47.760 --> 21:55.040
 or early retirement is $1 million when the interest rate is 5%. During the crisis of March

21:55.040 --> 22:01.760
 of 2020, the interest rate went on a 10 year bond went to 50 basis points. So now the cost

22:01.760 --> 22:08.160
 of that bond is $10 million. The cost of social security went from a million dollars to $10 million.

22:08.160 --> 22:14.000
 So if you wanted to work your entire life, save money, and then retire risk free and live happily

22:14.000 --> 22:19.360
 ever after on a $50,000 salary, live in on a beach in Mexico, wherever you wanted to go,

22:20.320 --> 22:25.600
 you had hyperinflation. The cost of your aspiration increased by a factor of 10

22:26.560 --> 22:32.320
 over the course of some amount of time. In fact, in that case, that was over the course of about 12

22:32.320 --> 22:41.680
 years. As the inflation rate ground down, the asset traded up. But the conventional view is,

22:41.680 --> 22:48.800
 oh, that's not a problem, because it's good that the bond is highly priced because we own the bond.

22:49.840 --> 22:57.200
 Or what's the problem with the inflation rate in housing being 19%? It's an awful problem for a

22:57.200 --> 23:02.720
 22 year old that's starting their first job, that's saving money to buy a house. But it would

23:02.720 --> 23:09.440
 be characterized as a benefit to society by a conventional economist who would say, well, housing

23:09.440 --> 23:14.400
 asset values are higher because of interest rate fluctuation, and now the economy has got more

23:14.400 --> 23:24.240
 wealth. And so that's viewed as a benefit. So what's being missed here, like the suffering

23:24.240 --> 23:32.880
 of the average person, or the struggle, the suffering, the pain of the average person,

23:34.080 --> 23:37.760
 like metrics that captured that within the economic system? Is that when you're talking

23:37.760 --> 23:43.680
 about different... One way to say it is a conventional view of inflation as CPI

23:43.680 --> 23:55.200
 understates the human misery that's inflicted upon the working class and on mainstream companies by

23:56.720 --> 24:01.920
 the political class. And so it's a massive shift of wealth from the working class to the property

24:01.920 --> 24:09.280
 class. It's a massive shift of power from the free market to the centrally governed or the

24:09.280 --> 24:17.680
 controlled market. It's a massive shift of power from the people to the government. And maybe one

24:17.680 --> 24:23.840
 more illustrative point here, Alexis, is what do you think the inflation rate's been for the past

24:23.840 --> 24:30.000
 100 years? Oh, you're talking about the scalar again? If you took a survey of everybody on the

24:30.000 --> 24:35.680
 street and you asked them, what do they think inflation was? What is it? You remember when

24:35.680 --> 24:43.920
 Jerome Powell said our target's 2%, but we're not there. If you go around the corner, I have posted

24:43.920 --> 24:55.120
 the deed to this house sold in 1930. Okay. And the number on that deed is $100,000, 1930. And if you

24:55.120 --> 25:05.520
 go on Zillow and you get the Z estimate. Is it higher than that? $30,500,000. So that's 92

25:05.520 --> 25:17.520
 years, 1930 or 2022. And in 92 years, we've had 305x increase in price of the house. Now,

25:17.520 --> 25:23.040
 if you actually back calculate, you come to a conclusion that the inflation rate was approximately

25:23.040 --> 25:33.200
 6.5% a year every year for 92 years. Okay. And there's nobody, nobody in government,

25:33.200 --> 25:39.840
 no conventional economists that would ever admit to an inflation rate of 7% a year in the US dollar

25:39.840 --> 25:48.400
 over the last century. Now, if you dig deeper, I mean, one guy that's done a great job working on

25:48.400 --> 25:54.320
 this is Seyfettin Amos who wrote the book, The Bitcoin Standard. And he notes that on average,

25:54.320 --> 26:00.560
 it looks like the inflation rate and the money supply is about 7% a year all the way up to the

26:00.560 --> 26:07.680
 year 2020. If you look at the S&P index, which is a market basket of scarce desirable stocks,

26:09.120 --> 26:17.200
 it returned about 10%. If you talk to 10% a year for 100 years, the money supply is expanding at

26:17.200 --> 26:24.400
 7% 100 years. If you actually talk to economists or you look at the economy and you ask the question,

26:24.400 --> 26:32.000
 how fast does the economy grow in its entirety year over year? Generally about 2% to 3%. Like

26:32.000 --> 26:39.040
 the sum total impact of all this technology and human ingenuity might get you a 2.5, 3% improvement

26:39.040 --> 26:45.600
 a year. As measured by GDP. Are you okay with that? I'm not sure. I'm not sure I'd go that far yet,

26:45.600 --> 26:53.520
 but I would just say that if you had the human race doing stuff and if you asked the question,

26:53.520 --> 26:59.200
 how much more efficiently will we do this stuff next year than this year? Or what's the value of

26:59.200 --> 27:05.280
 all of our innovations and inventions and investments in the past 12 months? You'd be

27:05.280 --> 27:12.960
 hard pressed to say we get 2% better. Typical investor thinks they're 10% better every year.

27:13.600 --> 27:19.200
 So if you look at what's going on, really, when you're holding a million dollars of stocks and

27:19.200 --> 27:25.680
 you're getting a 10% gain a year, you really get a 7% expansion of the money supply. You're getting

27:25.680 --> 27:34.080
 a 2% or 3% gain under best circumstances. And another way to say that is if the money supply

27:34.080 --> 27:40.400
 stopped expanding at 7% a year, the S&P yield might be 3% and not 10%. It probably should be.

27:42.640 --> 27:47.280
 Now, that gets you to start to ask a bunch of other fundamental questions. Like

27:47.280 --> 27:54.240
 if I borrow a billion dollars and pay 3% interest and the money supply expands at 7% to 10% a year,

27:54.240 --> 28:02.160
 and I ended up making a 10% return on a billion dollar investment paying 3% interest, is that fair?

28:03.200 --> 28:10.160
 And who suffered so that I could do that? Because in an environment where you're just

28:10.160 --> 28:15.760
 inflating the money supply and you're holding the assets constant, it stands the reason that

28:15.760 --> 28:21.680
 the price of all the assets is going to appreciate somewhat proportional to the money supply.

28:22.400 --> 28:27.360
 And the difference in asset appreciations is going to be a function of the scarce desirable

28:27.360 --> 28:33.440
 quality of the assets, and to what extent can I make more of them, and to what extent are they

28:33.440 --> 28:41.440
 truly limited in supply? Yeah, so we'll get to a lot of the words you said there. The scarcity,

28:41.440 --> 28:48.560
 the scarcity, and so connected to how limited they are and the value of those

28:49.120 --> 28:55.200
 assets. But you also said, so the expansion of the money supply, which is put another way,

28:55.200 --> 28:59.920
 is printing money. And so is that always bad, the expansion of the money supply?

29:01.440 --> 29:07.840
 Just to put some terms on the table so we understand them. You nonchalantly say it's

29:07.840 --> 29:12.800
 always on average expanding every year, the money supply is expanding every year by 7%.

29:13.600 --> 29:20.000
 That's a bad thing? That's universally a bad thing? It's awful. I guess to be precise,

29:21.200 --> 29:31.360
 it's the currency. I would say money is monetary energy or economic energy. And the economic

29:31.360 --> 29:37.120
 energy has to find its way into a medium. So if you want to move it rapidly as a medium of exchange,

29:37.120 --> 29:42.800
 it has to find its way into currency. But the money can also flow into property, like a house

29:42.800 --> 29:50.400
 or gold. If the money flows into property, it'll probably hold its value much better if the money

29:50.400 --> 29:59.040
 flows into currency. If you had put $100,000 in this house, you would have 305x return over 92

29:59.040 --> 30:04.320
 years. But if you had put the money, $100,000, in a safe deposit box and buried it in the basement,

30:04.320 --> 30:14.560
 you would have lost 99.7% of your wealth over the same time period. So the expansion of the currency

30:16.000 --> 30:22.880
 creates a massive inefficiency in the society, what I'll call an adiabatic lapse. What we're

30:22.880 --> 30:30.240
 doing is we're bleeding the civilization to death. What's the adiabatic, what's that word?

30:30.240 --> 30:38.880
 Adiabatic lapse. Right. In aerospace engineering, you want to solve any problem, they start with

30:38.880 --> 30:46.000
 the phrase, assume an adiabatic system. And what that means is a closed system. So I've got a

30:46.000 --> 30:52.320
 container and in that container, no air leaves and no air enters, no energy exits or enters.

30:52.320 --> 30:56.320
 So it's a closed system. So you got the closed system lapse.

30:56.320 --> 31:01.920
 There's a leak in the ship.

31:01.920 --> 31:06.640
 I'm going to use a physical metaphor for you because you're the jujitsu, right? Like you've

31:06.640 --> 31:13.520
 got 10 pints of blood in your body. And so before your next workout, I'm going to take one pint from

31:13.520 --> 31:22.240
 you. Now you're going to go exercise, but you've lost 10% of your blood. You're not going to perform

31:22.240 --> 31:28.160
 as well. It takes about one month for your body to replace the red blood platelets. So what if I

31:28.160 --> 31:34.480
 tell you every month you got to show up and I'm going to bleed you? Yeah. Okay. So if I'm draining

31:34.480 --> 31:41.600
 the energy, I'm draining the blood from your body, you can't perform. If you, adiabatic lapse is when

31:41.600 --> 31:47.280
 you go up in altitude, every thousand feet, you lose three degrees. You go at 50,000 feet, you're

31:47.280 --> 31:54.720
 150 degrees colder than sea level. That's why you look at your instruments and instead of 80 degrees,

31:54.720 --> 32:00.720
 you're minus 70 degrees. Why is the temperature falling? Temperature is falling because it's not

32:00.720 --> 32:13.040
 a closed system, it's an open system. As the air expands, the density falls, the energy per cubic

32:13.040 --> 32:18.080
 whatever falls and therefore the temperature falls. The heat's falling out of the solution.

32:18.800 --> 32:24.720
 So when you're inflating, let's say you're inflating the currency supply by 6%,

32:25.520 --> 32:34.400
 you're sucking 6% of the energy out of the fluid that the economy is using to function.

32:34.400 --> 32:39.680
 So the currency, this kind of ocean of currency, that's a nice way for the economy to function.

32:39.680 --> 32:44.720
 It's the most kind of, it's being inefficient when you expand the money supply, but it's

32:47.600 --> 32:53.040
 the liquid. I'm trying to find the right kind of adjective here. It's how you do transactions at

32:53.040 --> 33:00.240
 a scale of billions. Currency is the asset we use to move monetary energy around and you could use

33:00.240 --> 33:06.160
 the dollar or you could use the peso or you could use the bolivar. Selling houses and buying houses

33:06.160 --> 33:14.560
 is much more inefficient or like you can't transact between billions of people with houses.

33:14.560 --> 33:20.720
 Yeah. Properties don't make such good mediums of exchange. They make better stores of value

33:20.720 --> 33:28.720
 and they have utility value if it's a ship or a house or a plane or a bushel of corn, right?

33:29.280 --> 33:33.200
 Can I zoom out just for, can we zoom out? Keep zooming out until we reach

33:33.200 --> 33:38.960
 the origin of human civilization. But on the way, ask, you gave economists a D minus.

33:39.600 --> 33:42.080
 I'm not even going to ask you what you give to governments.

33:44.080 --> 33:51.440
 Do you think their failure, economists and government failure is malevolence or incompetence?

33:52.880 --> 34:00.400
 I think policymakers are well intentioned, but generally all government policy is inflationary

34:00.400 --> 34:04.720
 and all government, it's inflammatory and inflationary. So what I mean by that is

34:05.920 --> 34:13.840
 when you have a policy pursuing supply chain independence, if you have an energy policy,

34:13.840 --> 34:20.880
 if you have a labor policy, if you have a trade policy, if you have any kind of foreign policy,

34:20.880 --> 34:26.960
 a domestic policy, a manufacturing policy, every one of these, a medical policy,

34:26.960 --> 34:35.600
 every one of these policies interferes with the free market and generally prevents some rational

34:35.600 --> 34:42.320
 actor from doing it in a cheaper, more efficient way. So when you layer them on top of each other,

34:42.320 --> 34:46.960
 they all have to be paid for. If you want to shut down the entire economy for a year,

34:46.960 --> 34:50.880
 you have to pay for it, right? If you want to fight a war, you have to pay for it,

34:50.880 --> 34:56.880
 pay for it, right? If you don't want to use oil or natural gas, you have to pay for it.

34:56.880 --> 35:02.080
 If you don't want to manufacture semiconductors in China and you want to manufacture them in the

35:02.080 --> 35:08.000
 US, you got to pay for it. If I rebuild the entire supply chain in Pennsylvania and I hire a bunch of

35:08.000 --> 35:16.640
 employees and then I unionize the employees, then not only am I idle the factory in the Far East,

35:16.640 --> 35:23.360
 it goes to 50% capacity. So whatever it sells, it has to raise the price on. And then I drive up

35:23.360 --> 35:28.800
 the cost of labor for every other manufacturer in the US because I'm competing against them,

35:29.600 --> 35:34.240
 right? I'm changing that condition. So everything gets less efficient, everything gets more

35:34.240 --> 35:41.200
 expensive. And of course, the government couldn't really pay for its policies and its wars with

35:41.200 --> 35:46.320
 taxes. We didn't pay for World War I with tax. We didn't pay for World War II with tax. We didn't

35:46.320 --> 35:52.240
 pay for Vietnam with tax. In fact, when you trace this, what you realize is the government never

35:52.240 --> 35:57.680
 pays for all of its policies with tax. Because it's too painful to ask to raise the taxes to

35:57.680 --> 36:04.400
 truly transparently pay for the things you're doing with taxes, with taxpayer money because

36:04.400 --> 36:10.560
 they feel the pain. That's one interpretation or it's just too transparent. If people understood

36:10.560 --> 36:18.960
 the true cost of war, they wouldn't want to go to war. If you were told that you would lose 95%

36:18.960 --> 36:28.160
 of your assets and 90% of everything you ever will be taken from you, you might reprioritize

36:28.160 --> 36:32.560
 your thought about a given policy and you might not vote for that politician. But you're still

36:32.560 --> 36:38.640
 saying incompetence, not malevolence. So fundamentally, government creates a bureaucracy

36:38.640 --> 36:48.400
 of incompetence is kind of how you look at it. I think a lack of humility. If people had more

36:48.400 --> 36:55.280
 humility, then they would realize. Humility about how little they know, how little they understand

36:55.280 --> 36:59.200
 about the function of complex systems. There's a phrase from Quint Eastwood's movie, Unforgiven,

36:59.200 --> 37:06.560
 where he says a man's got to know his limitations. I think that a lot of people overestimate

37:06.560 --> 37:17.600
 what they can accomplish and experience. Experience in life causes you to reevaluate that.

37:17.600 --> 37:24.480
 So I mean, I've done a lot of things in my life and generally, my mistakes were always my good

37:24.480 --> 37:33.200
 ideas that I enthusiastically pursued to the detriment of my great ideas that required 150%

37:33.200 --> 37:40.720
 of my attention to prosper. So I think people pursue too many good ideas. They all sound good,

37:41.600 --> 37:47.680
 but there's just a limit to what you can accomplish. And everybody underestimates the

37:47.680 --> 37:58.000
 challenges of implementing an idea. And they always overestimate the benefits of the pursuit

37:58.000 --> 38:04.400
 of that. And so I think it's an overconfidence that causes an overexuberance in pursuit of

38:04.400 --> 38:13.200
 policies. And as the ambition of the government expands, so must the currency supply. Well,

38:13.200 --> 38:19.040
 I could say the money supply, but let's say the currency supply. You can triple the number of

38:19.040 --> 38:25.440
 pesos in the economy, but it doesn't triple the amount of manufacturing capacity in the set

38:25.440 --> 38:31.200
 economy. And it doesn't triple the amount of assets in the economy, it just triples the pesos. So

38:31.760 --> 38:39.440
 as you increase the currency supply, then the price of all those scarce desirable things

38:39.440 --> 38:47.920
 will tend to go up rapidly. And the confidence of all of the institutions, the corporations,

38:47.920 --> 38:52.640
 and the individual actors and trading partners will collapse.

38:52.640 --> 38:59.920
 TK If we take a tangent on a tangent, and we will return soon to the big human civilization

38:59.920 --> 39:08.560
 question. So if government naturally wants to buy stuff it can't afford,

39:10.080 --> 39:19.920
 what's the best form of government? Anarchism, libertarianism. So there's not even armies,

39:19.920 --> 39:28.400
 there's no borders, that's anarchism. The smallest possible, the best government would

39:28.400 --> 39:33.040
 be the least and the debate will be over that. TK When you think about this stuff,

39:33.600 --> 39:39.520
 do you think about, okay, government is the way it is, I as a person that can generate great ideas,

39:39.520 --> 39:44.080
 how do I operate in this world? Or do you also think about the big picture if we start a new

39:44.080 --> 39:49.600
 TK civilization somewhere on Mars, do you think about what's the ultimate form of government?

39:50.240 --> 39:52.560
 What's at least a promising thing to try?

39:58.320 --> 40:05.440
 TK You know, I have laser eyes on my profile on Twitter, Lex.

40:05.440 --> 40:06.640
 TK What does that mean?

40:06.640 --> 40:12.880
 TK And the significance of laser eyes is to focus on the thing that can make a difference.

40:12.880 --> 40:14.240
 TK Yes.

40:14.240 --> 40:17.360
 TK And if I look at the civilization,

40:19.120 --> 40:27.840
 I would say half the problems in the civilization are due to the fact that our understanding of

40:27.840 --> 40:34.480
 economics and money is defective, half, 50%. I don't know, it's worth $500 trillion worth of

40:34.480 --> 40:43.920
 problems. Like money represents all the economic energy in the civilization and it kind of equates

40:43.920 --> 40:49.440
 to all the products, all the services and all the assets that we have and we're ever gonna have.

40:49.440 --> 40:58.320
 So that's half. The other half of the problems in the civilization are medical and military and

40:58.320 --> 41:09.040
 political and philosophical and natural. And I think that there are a lot of different solutions

41:09.600 --> 41:18.880
 to all those problems and they are all honorable professions and they all merit a lifetime of

41:18.880 --> 41:26.480
 consideration for the specialists in all those areas. I think that what I could offer it's

41:26.480 --> 41:34.640
 constructive is inflation is completely misunderstood. It's a much bigger problem

41:34.640 --> 41:39.360
 than we understand it to be. We need to introduce engineering and science

41:39.360 --> 41:45.920
 techniques into economics if we wanna further the human condition. All government policy is

41:45.920 --> 41:54.560
 inflationary. And another pernicious myth is inflation is always and everywhere a monetary

41:54.560 --> 42:00.400
 phenomenon. A famous quote by Milton Friedman, I believe, it's like, it's a monetary phenomenon

42:00.400 --> 42:05.840
 that is inflation comes from expanding the currency supply. It's a nice phrase and it's

42:05.840 --> 42:12.160
 oftentimes quoted by people that are anti inflation. But again, it just signifies a lack

42:12.160 --> 42:19.440
 of appreciation of what the issue is. Inflation is, if I had a currency which was completely

42:19.440 --> 42:25.360
 noninflationary, if I never printed another dollar, and if I eliminated fractional reserve

42:25.360 --> 42:31.360
 banking from the face of the earth, we'd still have inflation. And we have inflation as long

42:31.360 --> 42:40.240
 as we have government that is capable of pursuing any kind of policies that are in themselves

42:40.240 --> 42:46.320
 inflationary and generally they all are. So in general, inflationary is the big

42:46.320 --> 42:52.160
 the big characteristic of human nature that governments collection of groups that have

42:52.160 --> 42:59.920
 power over others and allocate other people's resources will try to intentionally or not hide

42:59.920 --> 43:06.800
 the costs of those allocations, like in some tricky ways, whatever the options ever available.

43:07.760 --> 43:14.640
 You know, hiding the cost is like, is like the tertiary thing, like, the primary goal

43:14.640 --> 43:19.600
 is the government will attempt to do good. Right. And that's the fundamental, that's

43:19.600 --> 43:24.160
 the primary problem. They will attempt to do good and they will and they will do it.

43:24.160 --> 43:30.080
 They will do good imperfectly and they will create oftentimes as much damage,

43:30.960 --> 43:35.280
 more damage than the good they do. Most government policy will be iatrogenic. It will,

43:35.280 --> 43:39.840
 it will create more harm than good in the pursuit of it. But it is what it is.

43:39.840 --> 43:47.200
 The secondary, the secondary issue is they will unintentionally pay for it

43:47.200 --> 43:54.880
 by expanding the currency supply without realizing that they're, they're actually

43:54.880 --> 44:01.680
 paying for it in in a suboptimal fashion. They'll collapse their own currencies while they attempt

44:01.680 --> 44:08.320
 to do good. The tertiary issue is they will mismeasure how badly they're collapsing the

44:08.320 --> 44:14.320
 currency. So for example, if you go to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, you know, and look at the

44:14.320 --> 44:19.920
 numbers printed by the Fed, they'll say, oh, it looks like the dollar's lost 95% of its purchasing

44:19.920 --> 44:26.400
 power over 100 years. Okay, they sort of fess up that there's a problem, but they make it 95%

44:26.400 --> 44:34.560
 loss over 100 years. What they don't do is realize it's a 99.7% loss over 80 years. So they will

44:34.560 --> 44:43.360
 mismeasure just the horrific extent of the monetary policy in pursuit of the foreign

44:43.360 --> 44:52.320
 policy and the domestic policy, which they overestimate their budget and their means to

44:52.320 --> 45:00.400
 accomplish their ends, and they underestimate the cost. And they're oblivious to the horrific

45:00.400 --> 45:06.640
 damage that they do to the civilization because the mental models that they use that are

45:06.640 --> 45:13.760
 conventionally taught are wrong, right? The mental model that, like, it's okay, we can print all this

45:13.760 --> 45:21.040
 money because the velocity of the money is low, right? Because money velocity is a scalar and

45:21.040 --> 45:25.920
 inflation is the scalar, and we don't see 2% inflation yet, and the money velocity is low,

45:25.920 --> 45:32.080
 and so it's okay if we print trillions of dollars. Well, the money velocity was immediate,

45:33.120 --> 45:41.360
 right? The velocity of money through the crypto economy is 10,000 times faster than the velocity

45:41.360 --> 45:47.440
 of money through the consumer economy, right? I think Nick pointed out when you spoke to him,

45:47.440 --> 45:52.480
 he said it takes two months for a credit card transaction to settle, right? So you want to

45:52.480 --> 45:57.680
 spend a million dollars in the consumer economy, you can move it six times a year.

45:58.320 --> 46:04.160
 You put a million dollars into gold, gold will sit in a vault for a decade, okay? So the velocity

46:04.160 --> 46:10.240
 of money through gold is 0.1. You put the money in the stock market and you can trade it once a

46:10.240 --> 46:15.520
 week, the settlement is T plus 2, maybe you get to 2 to 1 leverage. You might get to a money

46:15.520 --> 46:21.920
 velocity of 100 a year in the stock market. You put your money into the crypto economy,

46:21.920 --> 46:27.840
 and these people are settling every four hours. And you know, if you're offshore,

46:27.840 --> 46:34.400
 they're trading with 20x leverage. So if you settle every day and you trade the 20x leverage,

46:34.400 --> 46:44.160
 you just went to 7,000. So the velocity of the money varies. I think the politicians,

46:44.160 --> 46:49.440
 they don't really understand inflation and they don't understand economics, but you can't blame

46:49.440 --> 46:55.760
 them because the economists don't understand economics. Because if they did, they would be

46:55.760 --> 47:04.160
 creating multivariate computer simulations where they actually put in the price of every piece of

47:04.160 --> 47:09.600
 housing in every city in the world, the full array of foods, and the full array of products,

47:09.600 --> 47:16.320
 and the full array of assets. And then on a monthly basis, they would publish all those

47:16.320 --> 47:24.000
 results. And that's a high bandwidth requirement. And I think that people don't really want to

47:24.000 --> 47:32.480
 embrace it. And also, the most pernicious thing, there's that phrase, you know, you can't tell

47:32.480 --> 47:38.640
 people what to think, but you can tell them what to think about. The most pernicious thing is I get

47:38.640 --> 47:47.760
 you to misunderstand the phenomena so that even when it's happening to you, you don't appreciate

47:47.760 --> 47:53.200
 that it's a bad thing and you think it's a good thing. So if housing prices are going up 20% year

47:53.200 --> 47:57.920
 over year, and I say, this is great for the American public because most of them are homeowners,

47:58.480 --> 48:08.000
 then I have misrepresented a phenomena. Inflation is 20%, not 7%. And then I have misrepresented it

48:08.000 --> 48:15.200
 as being a positive rather than a negative. And people will stare at it and you could even show

48:15.200 --> 48:20.800
 them their house on fire and they would perceive it as being great because it's warming them up

48:20.800 --> 48:25.520
 and they're going to save on their heat costs. It does seem that the cruder the model,

48:25.520 --> 48:31.840
 whether it's economics, whether it's psychology, the easier it is to weave whatever the heck

48:31.840 --> 48:41.360
 narrative you want and not in a malicious way, but just like it's some kind of emergent phenomena,

48:41.360 --> 48:46.160
 this narrative thing that we tell ourselves. So you can tell any kind of story about inflation.

48:46.160 --> 48:51.040
 Inflation is good, inflation is bad. The cruder the model, the easier it is to tell a narrative

48:51.040 --> 48:58.880
 about it. So if you take an engineering approach, I feel like it becomes more and more difficult

48:58.880 --> 49:04.480
 to run away from sort of a true deep understanding of the dynamics of the system.

49:05.920 --> 49:10.800
 I mean, honestly, if you went to 100 people on the street and you asked them to define inflation,

49:10.800 --> 49:18.560
 how many would say it's a vector tracking the change in price of every product service

49:18.560 --> 49:25.760
 asset in the world over time? Not many. Now, if you went to them and you said,

49:25.760 --> 49:30.800
 do you think 2% inflation a year is good or bad? The majority would probably say,

49:30.800 --> 49:36.640
 well, I hear it's good. The majority of economists would say 2% inflation a year is good.

49:37.920 --> 49:48.240
 And of course, look at the ship next to us. What if I told you that the ship leaked 2% of its

49:48.240 --> 49:54.000
 volume every something, right? The ship is rotting 2% a year. That means the useful life of the ship

49:54.000 --> 50:00.640
 is 50 years. Now, ironically, that's true. Like a wooden ship had a 50 year to 100 year life,

50:00.640 --> 50:04.720
 100 would be long, 50 years, not unlikely. So when we built ships out of wood,

50:05.520 --> 50:12.480
 they had a useful life of about 50 years and then they sunk, they rotted. There's nothing good about

50:12.480 --> 50:20.400
 it, right? You build a ship out of steel and it's zero as opposed to 2% degradation. And how much

50:20.400 --> 50:29.760
 better is 0% versus 2%? Well, 2% means you have a useful life of, you know, it's half life of 35

50:29.760 --> 50:35.680
 years. 2% is a half life of 35 years. That's basically the half life of money and gold.

50:35.680 --> 50:42.400
 If I store your life force in gold, under perfect circumstances, you have a useful life of 35 years.

50:42.400 --> 50:52.160
 0% is a useful life of forever. So 0% is immortal. 2% is 35 years average life expectancy.

50:53.200 --> 50:58.880
 So the idea that you would think the life expectancy of the currency and the civilization

50:58.880 --> 51:05.840
 should be 35 years instead of forever is kind of a silly notion. But the tragic notion is it was,

51:05.840 --> 51:13.360
 you know, seven into 70 or 10 years. The money has had a half life of 10 years except for the fact

51:13.360 --> 51:21.920
 that in weak societies in Argentina or the like, the half life of the money is three to four years

51:21.920 --> 51:30.080
 in Venezuela, one year. So the United States dollar and the United States economic system

51:30.080 --> 51:36.000
 was the most successful economic system in the last hundred years in the world. We won every war.

51:36.000 --> 51:43.280
 We were the world superpower. Our currency lost 99.7% of its value. And that means, horrifically,

51:43.280 --> 51:51.840
 every other currency lost everything. In essence, the other ones were 99.9% except for most that

51:51.840 --> 51:59.680
 were 100% because they all completely failed. And, you know, you've got a mainstream economic

51:59.680 --> 52:09.680
 community, you know, that thinks that inflation is a number and 2% is desirable. It's kind of like,

52:11.360 --> 52:18.000
 you know, remember George Washington? You know how he died? Well meaning physicians bled him to

52:18.000 --> 52:26.160
 death. Okay, the last thing in the world you would want to do to a sick person is bleed them,

52:26.160 --> 52:32.320
 right? In the modern world, I think we understand that oxygen is carried by the blood cells and,

52:32.320 --> 52:42.800
 you know, there's that phrase, right? A triage phrase, what's the first thing you do in an

52:42.800 --> 52:49.120
 injury? Stop the bleeding. Single first thing, right? You show up after any accident, I look at

52:49.120 --> 52:54.160
 you, stop the bleeding because you're going to be dead in a matter of minutes if you bleed out.

52:54.960 --> 53:01.920
 So it strikes me as being ironic that orthodox conventional wisdom was bleed the patient to

53:01.920 --> 53:07.600
 death. And this was the most important patient in the country, maybe in the history of the country,

53:07.600 --> 53:14.320
 and we bled him to death trying to help him. So when you're actually inflating the money supply

53:14.320 --> 53:21.360
 at 7% but you're calling it 2% because you want to help the economy, you're literally bleeding

53:22.160 --> 53:28.800
 the free market to death. But the sad fact is George Washington went along with it because he

53:28.800 --> 53:35.840
 thought that they were going to do him good. And the majority of the people who were in the

53:35.840 --> 53:45.040
 majority of the society, most companies, most conventional thinkers, you know, the working class,

53:45.040 --> 53:50.560
 they go along with this because they think that someone has their best interest of mind and the

53:50.560 --> 53:57.440
 people that are bleeding them to death believe that prescription because their mental models

53:57.440 --> 54:06.960
 are just so defective. And then an understanding of energy and engineering and the economics that

54:06.960 --> 54:13.680
 are at play is crippled by these mental models. But that's both the bug in the future of human

54:13.680 --> 54:22.320
 civilization that ideas take hold, they unite us, we believe in them, and we make a lot of cool stuff

54:22.320 --> 54:31.200
 happen by, as an average, sort of just the fact of the matter, a lot of people believe the same

54:31.200 --> 54:36.240
 thing, they get together and they get some shit done because they believe that thing. And then

54:36.240 --> 54:43.200
 some ideas can be really bad and really destructive, but on average the ideas seem to be progressing

54:43.840 --> 54:49.840
 in a direction of good. Let me just step back. What the hell are we doing here, us humans on

54:49.840 --> 54:56.480
 this earth? How do you think of humans? How special are humans? How did human civilization

54:57.040 --> 55:01.760
 originate on this earth? And what is this human project that we're all taking on?

55:03.040 --> 55:08.480
 You mentioned fire and water and apparently bleeding you to death is not a good idea.

55:08.480 --> 55:13.120
 I always thought you can get the demons out in that way, but that was a recent

55:13.120 --> 55:23.440
 invention. So what's this thing we're doing here? I think what distinguishes human beings from

55:23.440 --> 55:31.680
 all the other creatures on the earth is our ability to engineer. We're engineers, right?

55:31.680 --> 55:37.280
 To solve problems or just build incredible cool things?

55:37.280 --> 55:43.200
 Engineering, harnessing energy and technique to make the world a better place than you found it.

55:45.200 --> 55:52.000
 Right? From the point that we actually started to play with fire, right? That was a big leap forward.

55:53.520 --> 56:01.440
 Harnessing the power of kinetic energy and missiles, another step forward. Every city

56:01.440 --> 56:10.800
 built on water. Why water? Well, water is bringing energy, right? If you actually put a turbine

56:11.360 --> 56:17.840
 on a river or you capture a change in elevation of water, you've literally harnessed gravitational

56:17.840 --> 56:26.080
 energy. But water is also bringing you food. It's also giving you a cheap form of getting

56:26.080 --> 56:31.680
 rid of your waste. It's also giving you free transportation. You want to move one ton blocks

56:31.680 --> 56:38.080
 around. You want to move them in water. So I think, I mean, the human story is really the

56:38.080 --> 56:48.240
 story of engineering a better world. And the rise in the human condition is determined by those

56:49.120 --> 56:53.280
 groups of people, those civilizations that were best at harnessing energy.

56:53.280 --> 57:01.600
 Right? If you look at the Greek civilization, they built it around ports and seaports and

57:02.320 --> 57:07.840
 water and created a trading network. The Romans were really good at harnessing all sorts of

57:08.880 --> 57:14.000
 engineering. I mean, the aqueducts are a great example. If you go to any big city,

57:14.720 --> 57:19.760
 you travel through cities in the Med, you find that the carrying capacity of the city or the

57:19.760 --> 57:25.120
 island is 5,000 people without running water. And then if you can find a way to bring water to it,

57:25.120 --> 57:31.840
 it increases by a factor of 10. And so human flourishing is really only possible through

57:31.840 --> 57:41.360
 that channeling of energy, right? That eventually takes the form of air power, right? I mean,

57:42.720 --> 57:49.120
 that ship, I mean, look at the intricacy of those sails. I mean, it's just the model is intricate.

57:49.120 --> 57:53.680
 Now think about all of the experimentation that took place to figure out how many sails to put

57:53.680 --> 57:58.640
 on that ship and how to rig them and how to repair them and how to operate them.

57:59.840 --> 58:05.520
 There's thousands of lives spent thinking through all the tiny little details,

58:06.640 --> 58:12.000
 all to increase the efficiency of this, the effectiveness, the efficiency of this ship

58:12.560 --> 58:17.120
 as it sails to water. And we should also note there's a bunch of cannons on the side.

58:17.120 --> 58:23.520
 So obviously another form of engineering, right? Energy harnessing with explosives

58:23.520 --> 58:28.720
 to achieve what end? That's another discussion. Exactly. Suppose we're trying to get off the

58:28.720 --> 58:33.680
 planet, right? I mean, well, there's a selection mechanism going on. So natural selection,

58:33.680 --> 58:39.280
 this, whatever, however evolution works, it seems that one of the interesting inventions on earth

58:39.280 --> 58:43.760
 was the predator prey dynamic that you want to be the bigger fish.

58:43.760 --> 58:48.720
 That violence seems to serve a useful purpose. If you look at earth as a whole,

58:48.720 --> 58:55.200
 we as humans now like to think of violence is really a bad thing. It seems to be one of the

58:55.920 --> 59:01.760
 amazing things about humans is we're ultimately tend towards cooperation. We want to, we like peace.

59:03.440 --> 59:08.160
 If you just look at history, we want things to be nice and calm and

59:08.160 --> 59:16.080
 calm. But just wars break out every once in a while and lead to immense suffering

59:16.080 --> 59:23.120
 and destruction and so on. And they have a kind of like resetting the palette

59:25.040 --> 59:32.800
 effect. It's one that's full of just immeasurable human suffering, but it's like a way to start over.

59:32.800 --> 59:39.440
 We're quite the apex predator on the planet. And I Googled something the other day,

59:40.000 --> 59:45.920
 you know, what's the most common form of mammal life on earth?

59:46.640 --> 59:48.640
 By number of organisms?

59:48.640 --> 59:49.120
 Count.

59:49.120 --> 59:49.760
 By count.

59:49.760 --> 59:54.480
 And the answer that came back was human beings. I was shocked. I couldn't believe it, right? It says

59:55.520 --> 59:59.280
 apparently if we're just looking at mammals, the answer was human beings are the most common,

59:59.280 --> 1:00:04.320
 which was very interesting to me. I almost didn't believe it, but I was trying to,

1:00:04.320 --> 1:00:08.800
 you know, eight billion or so human beings. There's no other mammal that's got more than

1:00:08.800 --> 1:00:13.760
 eight billion. If you walk through downtown Edinburgh and Scotland and you look up on this

1:00:13.760 --> 1:00:21.120
 hill and this castle up on the hill, you know, and you talk to people and the story is, oh yeah,

1:00:21.120 --> 1:00:26.480
 well that was a British castle, before it's a Scottish castle, before it was a Pict castle,

1:00:26.480 --> 1:00:31.680
 before it was a Roman castle, before it was, you know, some other Celtic castle.

1:00:32.720 --> 1:00:37.360
 Then they found 13 prehistoric castles buried one under the other under the other.

1:00:38.240 --> 1:00:44.560
 And you get to the conclusion that 100,000 years ago, somebody showed up and grabbed the high

1:00:44.560 --> 1:00:51.280
 point, the apex of the city, and they built a stronghold there, and they flourished,

1:00:51.280 --> 1:00:55.040
 and their family flourished, and their tribe flourished until someone came along and knocked

1:00:55.040 --> 1:01:02.400
 them off the hill. And it's been a nonstop, never ending fight by the the aggressive,

1:01:02.400 --> 1:01:08.560
 most powerful entity, family, organization, municipality, tribe, whatever.

1:01:08.560 --> 1:01:09.760
 All for the hill.

1:01:09.760 --> 1:01:16.000
 For that one hill, going back since time immemorial. And, you know,

1:01:16.960 --> 1:01:23.600
 you scratch your head and you think, it seems like it's like just this never ending.

1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:30.240
 But doesn't that lead, if you just, all kinds of metrics, that seems to improve the quality

1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:36.800
 of our cannons and ships as a result. Like, it seems that war, just like your laser eyes,

1:01:36.800 --> 1:01:39.440
 focuses the mind on the engineering tasks.

1:01:39.440 --> 1:01:47.440
 It is that. And it does remind you that the winner is always the most powerful.

1:01:48.640 --> 1:01:53.120
 And we throw that phrase out, but no one thinks about what that phrase means.

1:01:53.120 --> 1:01:58.240
 Like, who's the most powerful, or the, you know, or the most powerful side one,

1:01:58.240 --> 1:02:04.560
 but they don't think about it. And they think about power, energy delivered in a period of

1:02:04.560 --> 1:02:10.720
 time. And then you think a guy with a spear is more powerful than someone with their fist,

1:02:10.720 --> 1:02:14.400
 and someone with a bow and arrow is more powerful than the person with the spear.

1:02:14.400 --> 1:02:19.040
 And then you realize that somebody with bronze is more powerful than without,

1:02:19.040 --> 1:02:23.920
 and steel is more powerful than bronze. And if you look at the Romans, you know,

1:02:23.920 --> 1:02:28.880
 they persevered, you know, with artillery, and they could stand off from 800 meters and

1:02:28.880 --> 1:02:35.520
 blast you to smithereens. You know, you study the history of the Balearic slingers, right?

1:02:35.520 --> 1:02:40.960
 And, you know, you think we invented bullets, but they invented bullets to put in slings

1:02:40.960 --> 1:02:46.320
 thousands of years ago. They could have stood off 500 meters and put a hole in your head,

1:02:46.320 --> 1:02:58.240
 right? And so there was never a time when humanity wasn't vying to come up with an asymmetric form

1:02:58.240 --> 1:03:01.920
 of projecting their own power via technology.

1:03:01.920 --> 1:03:10.480
 And absolute power is when a leader is able to control a large amount of humans, they're

1:03:10.480 --> 1:03:17.200
 they're facing the same direction, working in the same direction to leverage energy.

1:03:17.200 --> 1:03:19.360
 The most organized society wins.

1:03:20.080 --> 1:03:20.800
 Yeah.

1:03:20.800 --> 1:03:26.160
 When the Romans were dominating everybody, they were the most organized civilization

1:03:26.720 --> 1:03:33.680
 in Europe. And as long as they stayed organized, they dominated, and at some point they overexpanded

1:03:33.680 --> 1:03:39.600
 and got disorganized and they collapsed. And I guess you could say that, you know,

1:03:39.600 --> 1:03:45.680
 the struggle of human condition, it catalyzes the development of new technologies one after

1:03:45.680 --> 1:03:53.600
 the other. It penalizes anybody that rejects ocean power, right, gets penalized. You reject

1:03:53.600 --> 1:03:59.200
 artillery, you get penalized. You reject atomic power, you get penalized. If you reject digital

1:03:59.200 --> 1:04:07.600
 power, cyber power, you get penalized. And the underlying control of the property keeps

1:04:07.600 --> 1:04:14.560
 shifting hands from, you know, one institution or one government to another based upon how

1:04:14.560 --> 1:04:20.400
 rationally they're able to channel that energy and how well organized or coordinated they are.

1:04:20.400 --> 1:04:24.320
 Well, that's a really interesting thing about both the human mind and governments,

1:04:24.880 --> 1:04:28.960
 that they, once they get a few good, and companies, once they get a few good ideas,

1:04:28.960 --> 1:04:35.520
 they seem to stick with them. They reject new ideas. It's almost, whether that's emergent or

1:04:35.520 --> 1:04:42.160
 or however that evolved, it seems to have a really interesting effect because when you're young,

1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:50.720
 you fight for the new ideas. You push them through. Then a few of us humans find success.

1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:58.640
 Then we get complacent. We take over the world using that new idea. And then the new young person

1:04:58.640 --> 1:05:06.320
 with the better new idea challenges you. And you, as opposed to pivoting, you stick with the old

1:05:06.320 --> 1:05:11.280
 and lose because of it. And that's how empires collapse. And it's just both at the individual

1:05:11.280 --> 1:05:15.760
 level that happens when two academics fighting about ideas or something like that, and at the

1:05:16.960 --> 1:05:23.520
 at the human civilization level, governments, they hold on to the ideas of old. It's fascinating.

1:05:23.520 --> 1:05:29.280
 Jay Famiglietti An ever persistent theme in the history of science is the paradigm shift. And

1:05:29.280 --> 1:05:36.720
 the paradigms shift when the old guard dies and a new generation arrives, or the paradigm shifts

1:05:36.720 --> 1:05:44.240
 when there's a war and everyone that disagrees with the idea of aviation finds bombs dropping

1:05:44.240 --> 1:05:49.440
 on their head, or everyone that disagrees with whatever your technology is has a rude awakening.

1:05:49.440 --> 1:05:56.160
 And if they totally disagree, their society collapses, and they're replaced by that new thing.

1:05:56.160 --> 1:05:58.560
 Trey Lockerbie A lot of the engineering you talked

1:05:58.560 --> 1:06:05.680
 about had to do with ships and cannons and leveraging water. What about this whole digital

1:06:05.680 --> 1:06:13.840
 thing that's happening, been happening over the past century? Is that still engineering in your

1:06:13.840 --> 1:06:17.600
 mind? You're starting to operate in these bits of information?

1:06:17.600 --> 1:06:20.640
 Jay Famiglietti I think there's two big ideas.

1:06:21.520 --> 1:06:27.440
 The first wave of ideas were digital information. And that was the internet way been running since

1:06:28.240 --> 1:06:36.240
 1990 or so for 30 years. And the second wave is digital energy. So if I look at digital information,

1:06:37.920 --> 1:06:44.560
 this idea that we want to digitally transform a book, I'm going to dematerialize every book

1:06:44.560 --> 1:06:52.400
 in this room into bits. And then I'm going to deliver a copy of the entire library to a billion

1:06:52.400 --> 1:07:00.720
 people. And I'm going to do it for pretty much de minimis electricity. If I can dematerialize music,

1:07:01.520 --> 1:07:13.920
 books, education, entertainment, maps, that is an incredibly exothermic transaction. It

1:07:13.920 --> 1:07:19.280
 gives... It's a crystallization when we collapse into a lower energy state as a civilization and

1:07:19.280 --> 1:07:25.200
 we give off massive amounts of energy. If you look at what Carnegie did, the richest man in the world

1:07:25.200 --> 1:07:30.720
 created libraries everywhere at the time, and he gave away his entire fortune. And now we can give

1:07:30.720 --> 1:07:36.960
 a better library to every six year old for nothing. And so what's the value of giving a

1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:44.480
 million books to eight billion people? That's the explosion in prosperity that comes from

1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:52.400
 digital transformation. And when we do it with maps, I transform the map, I put it into a car,

1:07:52.400 --> 1:07:58.080
 you get in the car and the car drives you where you want to go with the map. And how much better

1:07:58.080 --> 1:08:06.320
 is that than a Rand McNally Atlas right here? It's like a million times better. So the first wave of

1:08:06.320 --> 1:08:13.760
 digital transformation was the dematerialization of all of these informational things which are

1:08:13.760 --> 1:08:20.000
 non conservative. I could take Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, played for by the best orchestra in

1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:25.680
 Germany, and I could give it to a billion people and they could play it a thousand times each

1:08:26.560 --> 1:08:33.680
 at less than the cost of the one performance. So I deliver culture and education and erudition and

1:08:33.680 --> 1:08:40.560
 intelligence and insight to the entire civilization over digital rails. And the consequences of the

1:08:40.560 --> 1:08:47.200
 human race are first order, generally good, right? The world is a better place, it drives growth,

1:08:47.200 --> 1:08:52.560
 and you create these trillion dollar entities like Apple and Amazon and Facebook and Google

1:08:52.560 --> 1:08:57.680
 and Microsoft, right? That is the first wave. The second wave...

1:08:57.680 --> 1:09:06.880
 I'm sorry to interrupt, but that first wave, it feels like the impact that's positive,

1:09:07.680 --> 1:09:12.240
 you said the first order impact is generally positive. It feels like it's positive in a way

1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:20.320
 that nothing else in history has been positive. And then we may not actually truly be able to

1:09:20.320 --> 1:09:28.960
 understand the orders and magnitude of increase in productivity and just progress of human

1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:36.080
 civilization until we look back centuries from now. It just feels, or maybe, just looking at

1:09:36.080 --> 1:09:46.160
 the impact of Wikipedia, giving access to basic wisdom or basic knowledge and then perhaps wisdom

1:09:46.160 --> 1:09:51.920
 to billions of people. If you can just linger on that for a second, what's your sense of the

1:09:51.920 --> 1:10:01.120
 impact of that? You know, I would say if you're a technologist philosopher,

1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:09.920
 the impact of a technology is so much greater on the civilization and the human condition

1:10:09.920 --> 1:10:15.920
 than a non technology that is almost not worth your trouble to bother trying to fix things that

1:10:15.920 --> 1:10:23.680
 conventional way. So let's take example. I have a foundation, the Saylor Academy, and the Saylor

1:10:23.680 --> 1:10:30.240
 Academy gives away free education, free college education to anybody on earth that wants it.

1:10:30.880 --> 1:10:36.080
 And we've had more than a million students. And if you go and you take the physics class,

1:10:36.720 --> 1:10:40.560
 the lectures were by the same physics lecturer that taught me physics at MIT.

1:10:40.560 --> 1:10:48.240
 Except when I was at MIT, the cost of the first four weeks of MIT would have drained my family's

1:10:48.240 --> 1:10:54.160
 life, collective life savings for the first last hundred years. Like a hundred years worth of my

1:10:54.160 --> 1:10:58.480
 father, my grandfather, my great grandfather, they saved every penny they had after a hundred

1:10:58.480 --> 1:11:04.160
 years. They could have paid for one week or two weeks of MIT. That's how fiendishly expensive and

1:11:04.160 --> 1:11:11.360
 inefficient it was. So I went on scholarship. I was lucky to have a scholarship. But on the other

1:11:11.360 --> 1:11:18.240
 hand, I sat in the back of the 801 lecture hall and I was like right up in the rafters.

1:11:18.240 --> 1:11:22.720
 It's an awful experience on these like uncomfortable wooden benches and you can

1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:29.360
 barely see the blackboard. And you got to be there synchronously. And the stuff we upload,

1:11:29.360 --> 1:11:34.560
 you can start it and stop it and watch it on your iPad or watch it on your computer

1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:38.640
 and rewind it multiple times and sit in a comfortable chair and you can do it from

1:11:38.640 --> 1:11:44.960
 anywhere on earth and it's absolutely free. So I think about this and I think you want to improve

1:11:44.960 --> 1:11:52.880
 the human condition. You need people with postgraduate level education. You need PhDs.

1:11:52.880 --> 1:11:58.000
 And I know this sounds kind of elitist, but you want to cure cancer and you want to go to the

1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:06.080
 stars, fusion drive. We need new propulsion, right? We need extraordinary breakthroughs

1:12:06.800 --> 1:12:14.640
 in every area of basic science, you know, be it biology or propulsion or material science or

1:12:14.640 --> 1:12:19.280
 computer science. You're not doing that with an undergraduate degree. You're certainly not doing

1:12:19.280 --> 1:12:26.000
 it with a high school education. But the cost of a PhD is like a million bucks. There's like 10

1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:31.680
 million PhDs in the world if you check it out. There's 8 billion people in the world. How many

1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:38.720
 people could get a PhD or would want to? Maybe not 8 billion, but a billion, 500 million. Let's just

1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:46.480
 say 500 million to a billion. How do you go from 10 million to a billion highly educated people,

1:12:46.480 --> 1:12:52.800
 all of them specializing in, and I don't have to tell you how many different fields of human

1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:58.080
 endeavor there are. I mean, your life is interviewing these experts and there's so many,

1:12:59.280 --> 1:13:07.680
 right? You know, it's amazing. So how do I give a multimillion dollar education to a billion people?

1:13:07.680 --> 1:13:14.720
 And there's two choices. You can either endow a scholarship, in which case you pay $75,000 a year.

1:13:14.720 --> 1:13:23.520
 Okay. $75,000. Let's pay a million dollars a person. I can do it that way. And you're never,

1:13:24.320 --> 1:13:30.160
 even if you had a trillion dollars, if you had $10 trillion to throw at the problem,

1:13:30.160 --> 1:13:36.640
 and we've just thrown $10 trillion at certain problems, you don't solve the problem, right?

1:13:36.640 --> 1:13:40.880
 If I put $10 trillion on the table and I said educate everybody, give them all a PhD,

1:13:40.880 --> 1:13:46.320
 you still wouldn't solve the problem. Harvard University can't educate 18,000 people

1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:53.440
 simultaneously, or 87,000, or 800,000, or 8 million. So you have to dematerialize the

1:13:53.440 --> 1:13:58.880
 professor and dematerialize the experience. So you put it all as streaming on demand,

1:13:58.880 --> 1:14:05.600
 computer generated education, and you create simulations where you need to create simulations,

1:14:05.600 --> 1:14:15.360
 and you upload it. It's like the human condition is being held back by 500,000 well meaning

1:14:16.720 --> 1:14:23.440
 average algebra teachers. I love them. I mean, please don't take offense if you're an algebra

1:14:23.440 --> 1:14:30.400
 teacher, but instead of 500,000 algebra teachers going through the same motion over and over again,

1:14:30.400 --> 1:14:37.440
 what you need is like one, or five, or 10 really good algebra teachers, and they need to do it a

1:14:37.440 --> 1:14:45.920
 billion times a day, or a billion times a year for free. And if we do that, there's no reason

1:14:45.920 --> 1:14:53.120
 why you can't give infinite education, certainly in science, technology, engineering, and math,

1:14:53.120 --> 1:15:01.280
 right? Infinite education to everybody with no constraint. And I think the same is true,

1:15:01.280 --> 1:15:06.880
 right? With just about every other thing. If you want to bring joy to the world,

1:15:06.880 --> 1:15:12.160
 you need digital music. If you want to bring enlightenment to the world, you need digital

1:15:12.160 --> 1:15:19.360
 education. If you want to bring anything of consequence in the world, you got to digitally

1:15:19.360 --> 1:15:25.920
 transform it. And then you got to manufacture it something like a hundred times more efficiently

1:15:25.920 --> 1:15:35.040
 as a start, but a million times more efficiently is probably, you know, that's hopeful. Maybe you

1:15:35.040 --> 1:15:40.240
 have a chance. And if you look at all of these space endeavors and everything we're thinking

1:15:40.240 --> 1:15:45.120
 about getting to Mars, getting off the planet, getting to other worlds, number one thing you

1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:50.160
 got to do is you got to make a fundamental breakthrough in an engine. People dreamed

1:15:50.160 --> 1:15:55.040
 about flying for thousands of years, but until the internal combustion engine,

1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:02.320
 you didn't have enough, you know, enough energy, enough power in a light enough package

1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:09.680
 in order to solve the problem. And the human race has all sorts of those fundamental

1:16:09.680 --> 1:16:19.040
 all engines and materials and techniques that we need to master. And each one of them is a lifetime

1:16:19.040 --> 1:16:26.880
 of experimentation of someone capable of making a seminal contribution to the body of human

1:16:26.880 --> 1:16:30.240
 knowledge. There are certain problems like education that could be solved through this

1:16:30.800 --> 1:16:37.520
 process of dematerialization. And by the way, to give props to the 500k algebra teachers,

1:16:37.520 --> 1:16:43.440
 when I look at YouTube, for example, one possible approach is each one of those 500,000 teachers

1:16:43.440 --> 1:16:48.800
 probably had days and moments of brilliance. And if they had the ability to contribute to

1:16:49.280 --> 1:16:56.080
 in the natural selection process, like the market of education, where the best ones rise up, that's

1:16:56.080 --> 1:17:03.200
 a really interesting way, which is like the best day of your life, the best lesson you've ever

1:17:03.200 --> 1:17:13.360
 the best lesson you've ever taught could be found and sort of broadcast to billions of people.

1:17:14.560 --> 1:17:20.880
 So all of those kinds of ideas can be made real in the digital world. Now traveling across planets,

1:17:21.520 --> 1:17:27.680
 you still can't solve that problem with dematerialization. What you could solve

1:17:27.680 --> 1:17:34.480
 potentially is dematerializing the human brain where you can transfer, like you don't need to

1:17:34.480 --> 1:17:40.400
 have astronauts on the ship, you can have a floppy disk carrying a human brain.

1:17:41.040 --> 1:17:47.600
 Touching on those points, you'd love for the 500,000 algebra teachers to become 500,000 math

1:17:47.600 --> 1:17:53.600
 specialists, and maybe they clump into 50,000 specialties as teams, and they all pursue 50,000

1:17:53.600 --> 1:17:59.760
 new problems, and they put their algebra teaching on autopilot. That's the same as when I give you

1:17:59.760 --> 1:18:08.800
 11 cents worth of electricity and you don't have to row a boat eight hours a day before you can

1:18:08.800 --> 1:18:15.440
 eat. It would be a lot better that you would pay for your food in the first eight seconds of your

1:18:15.440 --> 1:18:23.920
 day and then you could start thinking about other things, right? With regard to technology, one

1:18:23.920 --> 1:18:30.800
 thing that I learned studying technology when you look at S curves is until you start the S curve,

1:18:31.840 --> 1:18:39.040
 you don't know whether you're a hundred years from viability, a thousand years from viability,

1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:47.200
 or a few months from viability. Isn't that fun? That's so fun. The early part of the S curve is

1:18:47.200 --> 1:18:55.040
 so fun because you don't know. In 1900, you could have got any number of learned academics to give

1:18:55.040 --> 1:19:01.200
 you 10,000 reasons why humans will never fly, right? And in 1903, the Wright brothers flew,

1:19:01.200 --> 1:19:09.600
 and by 1969, we're walking on the moon. So the advance that we made in that field was extraordinary,

1:19:09.600 --> 1:19:14.320
 but for the hundred years and 200 years before, they were just back and forth and nobody was

1:19:14.320 --> 1:19:23.440
 close. And that's the happy part. The happy part is we went from flying 20 miles an hour or whatever

1:19:23.440 --> 1:19:33.360
 to flying 25,000 miles an hour in 66 years. The unhappy part is I studied aeronautical

1:19:33.360 --> 1:19:41.280
 engineering at MIT in the 80s. And in the 80s, we had Gulfstream aircraft, we had Boeing 737s,

1:19:41.280 --> 1:19:48.160
 we had the Space Shuttle. And you fast forward 40 years and we pretty much had the same exact

1:19:48.160 --> 1:19:59.440
 aircraft. The efficiency of the engines was 20, 30% more. We slammed into a brick wall around

1:19:59.440 --> 1:20:10.320
 69 to 75. In fact, the Global Express, the Gulfstream, these were all engineered in the 70s,

1:20:10.320 --> 1:20:19.200
 some in the 60s. The fuselage silhouette of a Gulfstream of a G5 was the same shape as a G4,

1:20:19.200 --> 1:20:24.480
 is the same shape as a G3, is the same shape as a G2. And that's because they were afraid to change

1:20:24.480 --> 1:20:28.560
 the shape for 40 years because they worked it out in a wind tunnel, they knew it worked.

1:20:29.280 --> 1:20:36.240
 And when they finally decided to change the shape, it was like a $10 billion exercise with modern

1:20:36.240 --> 1:20:44.880
 supercomputers and computational fluid dynamics. Why was it so hard? What is that wall made of

1:20:44.880 --> 1:20:49.440
 that you slammed into? The right question is, so why does a guy that went to MIT that got an

1:20:49.440 --> 1:20:54.800
 aeronautical engineering degree spend his career in software? Why is it that I never a day in my

1:20:54.800 --> 1:21:00.720
 life, with the exception of some Air Force Reserve work, I never got paid to be an aeronautical

1:21:00.720 --> 1:21:04.800
 engineer and I worked in software engineering my entire career. Maybe software engineering

1:21:04.800 --> 1:21:11.520
 is the new aeronautical engineering in some way. Maybe you hit fundamental walls uncertain

1:21:12.160 --> 1:21:16.560
 until you have to return to it centuries later. Or no.

1:21:16.560 --> 1:21:21.200
 STUART The National Gallery of Art was endowed by a very rich man,

1:21:22.240 --> 1:21:29.360
 Andrew Mellon. And you know how he made his money? Aluminum. Okay? And so,

1:21:29.360 --> 1:21:36.240
 and you know what kind of airplanes you can create without aluminum? Nothing. Nothing, right?

1:21:36.240 --> 1:21:38.320
 LARRY So it's a materials problem.

1:21:38.320 --> 1:21:46.000
 STUART Okay, so 1900, we made massive advances in metallurgy, right? I mean, that was US steel,

1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:52.640
 that was iron to steel, aluminum, massive fortunes were created because this was a massive technical

1:21:52.640 --> 1:21:58.080
 advance. And then we also had the internal combustion engine and, you know, the story of Ford

1:21:58.080 --> 1:22:04.720
 and General Motors and Daimler Chrysler and the like is informed by that. So you have no jet

1:22:04.720 --> 1:22:10.320
 engines, no rocket motors, no internal combustion engines, you have no aviation. But even if you had

1:22:10.320 --> 1:22:15.760
 those engines, if you were trying to build those things with steel, no chance. You had to have

1:22:15.760 --> 1:22:23.120
 aluminum. So there's like two pretty basic technologies. And once you have those two

1:22:23.120 --> 1:22:32.480
 technologies, stuff happens very fast. So tell me the last big advance in like jet engines,

1:22:33.200 --> 1:22:39.520
 there hasn't been one. Like the last big advance in rocket engines, hasn't been one. The big

1:22:39.520 --> 1:22:45.760
 advances in spaceship design from what I can see are in the control systems, the gyros and the

1:22:45.760 --> 1:22:53.360
 ability to land, right, in a stable fashion. That's pretty amazing, landing a rocket. Also in the,

1:22:54.480 --> 1:23:03.120
 at least according to Elon and so on, the manufacture of the more efficient and less

1:23:03.120 --> 1:23:07.760
 expensive manufacture of rockets. So like it's a production, whatever that you call that

1:23:07.760 --> 1:23:13.360
 discipline of at scale manufacture, at scale production, so factory work. But it's not 10X.

1:23:13.360 --> 1:23:16.320
 I mean, maybe it's 10X over a period of a few decades.

1:23:16.320 --> 1:23:23.600
 When we figure out how to operate a spaceship, you know, on the water in your water bottle for

1:23:23.600 --> 1:23:29.040
 a year, right? Now, then you've got to break through. So the bottom line is propulsion,

1:23:29.840 --> 1:23:36.720
 propellant, propulsion technology, propellants and the materials technology, they were critical

1:23:36.720 --> 1:23:42.960
 to getting on that aviation S curve. And then we slammed into a wall. And then we had to

1:23:42.960 --> 1:23:51.520
 switch to a new S curve in the 70s. And the Boeing 747, the Global Express, the Gulf Stream,

1:23:51.520 --> 1:23:56.400
 these things were, the Space Shuttle, they were all pretty much reflective of that. And then we

1:23:56.400 --> 1:24:02.000
 kind of, then we stopped. And at that point, you have to switch to a new S curve. So the next

1:24:02.800 --> 1:24:08.640
 equivalent to the internal combustion engine was the CPU. And the next aluminum equipment was

1:24:08.640 --> 1:24:14.800
 the S curve. And then we actually started developing CPUs. The transistor gave way to CPUs.

1:24:14.800 --> 1:24:21.920
 And if you look at the power, right, the bandwidth that we had on computers and Moore's law, right?

1:24:22.480 --> 1:24:31.040
 What if the efficiency of jet engines had doubled every three years, right, in the last 40 years,

1:24:31.040 --> 1:24:38.240
 where we'd be right now, right? So I think that if you're a business person, if you're looking for

1:24:38.240 --> 1:24:45.040
 a real application of your mind, then you have to find that S curve. And ideally,

1:24:46.800 --> 1:24:53.200
 you have to find it in the first five, six, 10 years. But people always miss this. Let's take

1:24:53.200 --> 1:25:02.080
 Google Glass, right? Google Glass was an idea in 2013. The year is 2022. And people were quite sure

1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:06.960
 this was going to be a big thing. And it could have been at the beginning of the S curve.

1:25:06.960 --> 1:25:12.720
 But fundamentally, we didn't really have an effective mechanism. I mean, people getting

1:25:12.720 --> 1:25:17.680
 vertigo and they're, you know. But you didn't know that at the beginning of the S curve, right? I mean,

1:25:17.680 --> 1:25:23.520
 maybe some people had a deep intuition about the fundamentals of augmented reality. But you don't

1:25:23.520 --> 1:25:29.280
 know that. You don't have those, you're looking through the fog. You don't know. So the point is,

1:25:29.280 --> 1:25:37.520
 we're year zero in 2013. And we're still year zero in 2022 on that augmented reality. And when

1:25:37.520 --> 1:25:43.920
 somebody puts out a set of glasses that you can wear comfortably without getting vertigo,

1:25:44.720 --> 1:25:51.600
 right? Without any disorientation that managed to have the stability and the bandwidth necessary to

1:25:51.600 --> 1:25:58.800
 sync with the real world, you'll be in year one. And from that point, you'll have a 70 year or

1:25:58.800 --> 1:26:05.520
 some interesting future until you slam into a limit to growth. And then it'll slow down.

1:26:06.320 --> 1:26:13.120
 And this is the story of a lot of things, right? I mean, John D. Rockefeller got in the oil business

1:26:13.120 --> 1:26:24.240
 in the 1860s. And the oil business, as we understood it, became fairly mature by the 1920s,

1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:29.760
 the 30s. And then it actually stayed that way until we got to fracking, which was like seven

1:26:29.760 --> 1:26:34.960
 years later, and then it burst forward. So... The interesting story about Moore's law, though,

1:26:34.960 --> 1:26:41.920
 is that you get this constant burst of S curves on top of S curves on top of S curve. It's like

1:26:41.920 --> 1:26:48.480
 the moment you start slowing down, or almost ahead of you slowing down, you come up with another

1:26:48.480 --> 1:26:52.560
 innovation, another innovation. So Moore's law doesn't seem to happen in every

1:26:52.560 --> 1:26:58.880
 technological advancement. It seems like you only get a couple of S curves and then you're done

1:26:58.880 --> 1:27:04.560
 for a bit. So I wonder what the pressures there are that resulted in such success over several

1:27:04.560 --> 1:27:12.560
 decades and still going. Humility dictates that nobody knows when the S curve kicks off,

1:27:12.560 --> 1:27:20.000
 and you could be 20 years early or 100 years early. Leonardo da Vinci, you know,

1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:25.520
 they were... Michelangelo, they were designing flying machines hundreds and hundreds of years ago.

1:27:25.520 --> 1:27:30.560
 So humility says you're not quite sure when you really hit that commercial viability,

1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:36.800
 and it also dictates you don't know when it ends. Like, when will the party stop? When will

1:27:36.800 --> 1:27:41.760
 Moore's law stop and we'll get to the point where they're exponentially diminishing returns on

1:27:42.320 --> 1:27:48.560
 silicon performance? And when you... Just like we got exponentially diminishing returns on jet

1:27:48.560 --> 1:27:55.920
 engines, you know, and it just takes an exponential increase in effort to make it 10% better.

1:27:56.480 --> 1:28:02.000
 But while you're in the middle of it, then you know you can do things. So the reason that the

1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:09.920
 digital revolution is so important is because the underlying platforms, the bandwidth of and the

1:28:09.920 --> 1:28:17.280
 performance of the components, and I say the components are the radio protocols, mobile

1:28:17.280 --> 1:28:26.880
 protocols, the batteries, the CPUs, and the displays, right? Those four components are

1:28:26.880 --> 1:28:31.440
 pretty critical. They're all critical in the creation of an iPhone. I wrote about it in the

1:28:31.440 --> 1:28:38.880
 book, The Mobile Wave, and they catalyzed this entire mobile revolution. Because they have

1:28:38.880 --> 1:28:46.320
 advanced and continue to advance, they created the very fertile environment for all these digital

1:28:46.320 --> 1:28:56.080
 transformations. And the digital transformations themselves, right? They call for creativity in

1:28:56.080 --> 1:29:03.120
 their own, right? Like, I think the interesting thing about... Let's take digital maps, right? When

1:29:03.120 --> 1:29:11.200
 you conceptualize something as a dematerialized map, right? It becomes a map because I can put it

1:29:11.200 --> 1:29:18.400
 on a display, like an iPad, or I can put it in a car, like a Tesla. But if you really want to

1:29:18.400 --> 1:29:23.440
 figure it out, you can't think like an engineer. You need to think like a fantasy writer. Like,

1:29:23.440 --> 1:29:28.560
 this is where it's useful if you studied... If you read... Played Dungeons and Dragons, and you read

1:29:28.560 --> 1:29:36.080
 Lord of the Rings, and you studied all the fantasy literature. Because when I dematerialize the map,

1:29:36.080 --> 1:29:43.040
 first I put 10 million pages of satellite imagery into the map, right? That's a simple physical

1:29:43.040 --> 1:29:50.320
 transform. But then I start to put telemetry into the map, and I keep track of the traffic

1:29:50.320 --> 1:29:54.560
 rates on the roads. And I tell you whether you'll be in a traffic jam if you drive that way, and I

1:29:54.560 --> 1:29:58.960
 tell you which way to drive. And then I start to get feedback on where you're going, and I tell

1:29:58.960 --> 1:30:05.040
 you the restaurants closed, and people don't like it anyway. And then I put an AI on the map, and

1:30:05.040 --> 1:30:12.720
 then I put an AI on top of it, and I have it drive your car for you. And eventually, the implication

1:30:12.720 --> 1:30:17.680
 of digital transformation of maps is, I get in a self driving car, and I say, take me someplace

1:30:17.680 --> 1:30:27.360
 cool where I can eat. And how did you get to that last step, right? It wasn't simple engineering.

1:30:27.360 --> 1:30:33.280
 There's a bit of fantasy in there, a bit of magic. Design, art, whatever the heck you call it.

1:30:33.280 --> 1:30:39.600
 It's whatever, yeah, fantasy injects magic into the engineering process. Imagination

1:30:41.760 --> 1:30:50.480
 precedes great revolutions in engineering. It's like imagining a world of what you can do with

1:30:50.480 --> 1:30:54.400
 the display. How will the interaction be? That's where Google Glass actually came in, augmented

1:30:54.400 --> 1:30:59.840
 reality, virtual reality. People were playing in the space of sci fi, imagination.

1:30:59.840 --> 1:31:03.840
 They called a moonshot. They tried. It didn't work, but to their credit, they stopped trying,

1:31:03.840 --> 1:31:10.000
 right? And then there's new people. They keep dreaming. Dreamers all around us. I love those

1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:16.800
 dreamers, and most of them fail and suffer because of it. But some of them win Nobel prizes or become

1:31:16.800 --> 1:31:24.480
 billionaires. Well, what I would say is, if half the civilization dropped what they were doing

1:31:24.480 --> 1:31:32.320
 tomorrow and eagerly started working on launching a rocket to Alpha Centauri,

1:31:34.000 --> 1:31:41.360
 it might not be the best use of our resources because it's kind of like if half of Athens

1:31:41.360 --> 1:31:47.200
 in the year 500 BC eagerly started working on flying machines. If you went back and you said,

1:31:47.200 --> 1:31:52.000
 what advice would you give them? You would say, you know, it's not going to work till you get to

1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:56.800
 aluminum. And you're not going to get to aluminum until you work out the steel and certain other

1:31:56.800 --> 1:32:01.280
 things. And you're not going to get to that until you work out the calculus of variations and some

1:32:01.280 --> 1:32:05.920
 metallurgy. And there's a dude, Newton, that won't come along for quite a while, and he's going to

1:32:05.920 --> 1:32:11.520
 give you the calculus to do it. And until then, it's hopeless. So you might be better off to work

1:32:11.520 --> 1:32:18.640
 on the aqueduct or to focus upon sails or something. So if I look at this today, I say,

1:32:18.640 --> 1:32:25.280
 there's massive, profound civilization advances to be made through digital transformation of

1:32:25.280 --> 1:32:31.040
 information. And you can see them like that. This is the story of today. This is not the story of

1:32:31.040 --> 1:32:36.400
 today, right? It's 10 years old, what we've been seeing. We're living through different manifestations

1:32:36.400 --> 1:32:42.960
 of that story today, too, though. Like social media, the effects of that is very interesting

1:32:42.960 --> 1:32:49.760
 because ideas spread even, you talk about velocity of money, the velocity of ideas keeps increasing.

1:32:49.760 --> 1:33:00.560
 So like Wikipedia is a passive store. It's a store of knowledge. Twitter is like a water hose

1:33:00.560 --> 1:33:04.240
 or something. It's like spraying you with knowledge, whether you want it or not. It's like

1:33:04.240 --> 1:33:10.800
 social media is just like this explosion of ideas. And then we pick them up, and then we

1:33:10.800 --> 1:33:16.400
 pick them up. And then we try to understand ourselves because the drama of it also plays

1:33:16.400 --> 1:33:22.800
 with our human psyche. So sometimes there's more ability for misinformation, for propaganda to take

1:33:22.800 --> 1:33:27.760
 hold. So we get to learn about ourselves. We get to learn about the technology that can decelerate

1:33:27.760 --> 1:33:32.320
 the propaganda, for example, all that kind of stuff. But like the reality is we're living,

1:33:32.320 --> 1:33:38.880
 I feel like we're living through a singularity in the digital information space. And we're not,

1:33:38.880 --> 1:33:43.120
 we don't have a great understanding of exactly how it's transforming our lives.

1:33:43.760 --> 1:33:52.480
 This is where money is useful as a metaphor for significance, because if money is the economic

1:33:52.480 --> 1:34:00.080
 energy of the civilization, then something that's extraordinarily lucrative that's going to generate

1:34:00.080 --> 1:34:05.440
 a monetary or a wealth increase is a way to increase the net energy in the civilization.

1:34:05.440 --> 1:34:10.080
 And ultimately, if we had 10 times as much of everything, we'd have a lot more

1:34:11.520 --> 1:34:16.560
 free resources to pursue all of our advanced scientific and mathematical and theoretical

1:34:16.560 --> 1:34:20.880
 endeavors. So let's take Twitter. Twitter is something that could be 10 times more

1:34:20.880 --> 1:34:26.000
 valuable than it is. Twitter could be made 10 times better.

1:34:27.040 --> 1:34:29.680
 No, by the way, I should say that people should follow you on Twitter. Your Twitter

1:34:29.680 --> 1:34:33.920
 account is awesome. Thank you. It could be made 10 times better. Yeah.

1:34:33.920 --> 1:34:40.640
 Yeah. Twitter can be made 10 times better. If we take YouTube or take education,

1:34:42.320 --> 1:34:48.160
 we could generate a billion PhDs. And the question is, do you need any profound

1:34:48.800 --> 1:34:52.800
 breakthrough in materials or technology to do that? And the answer is not really.

1:34:53.840 --> 1:35:00.160
 So if you want to, you could make Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Twitter, all these things

1:35:00.160 --> 1:35:08.080
 better. The United States government, if they took 1% of the money they spend on the Department

1:35:08.080 --> 1:35:15.920
 of Education and they simply poured it into digital education and they gave degrees to

1:35:15.920 --> 1:35:22.400
 people that actually met those requirements, they could provide 100x as much education for

1:35:22.400 --> 1:35:28.720
 one one hundredth of the cost and they could do it with no new technology. That's a marketing

1:35:28.720 --> 1:35:35.920
 and political challenge. So I don't think every objective is equally practical.

1:35:36.640 --> 1:35:44.080
 And I think the benefit of being an engineer or thinking about practical achievements is

1:35:45.200 --> 1:35:52.400
 when the government pursues an impractical objective or when anybody, an entrepreneur,

1:35:53.120 --> 1:35:55.760
 not so bad with entrepreneur because they don't have that much money to waste,

1:35:55.760 --> 1:36:00.480
 when a government pursues an impractical objective, they squander trillions and trillions

1:36:00.480 --> 1:36:07.920
 of dollars and achieve nothing. Whereas if they pursue a practical objective or if they simply

1:36:07.920 --> 1:36:15.040
 get out of the way and do nothing and they allow the free market to pursue the practical objectives,

1:36:15.040 --> 1:36:19.040
 then I think you can have a profound impact on the human civilization.

1:36:19.040 --> 1:36:31.440
 And if I look at the world we're in today, I think that there are multi trillion, 10, 20,

1:36:31.440 --> 1:36:38.560
 50 trillion dollars worth of opportunities in the digital information realm yet to be obtained.

1:36:40.800 --> 1:36:47.520
 But there's hundreds of trillions of dollars of opportunities in the digital energy realm

1:36:47.520 --> 1:36:54.640
 that not only are they not obtained, the majority of people don't even know what digital energy is.

1:36:54.640 --> 1:37:00.960
 Most of them would reject the concept. They're not looking for it. They're not expecting to find it.

1:37:00.960 --> 1:37:06.800
 It's inconceivable because it is a paradigm shift. But in fact, it's completely practical.

1:37:07.280 --> 1:37:13.840
 Right under our nose, it's staring at us and it could make the entire civilization

1:37:13.840 --> 1:37:18.880
 work dramatically better in every respect.

1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:26.400
 So you mentioned in the digital world, digital information is one, digital energy is two,

1:37:26.960 --> 1:37:34.240
 and the possible impact on the world and the set of opportunities available in the digital energy

1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:39.680
 space is much greater. So how do you think about digital energy? What is it?

1:37:39.680 --> 1:37:44.960
 So I'll start with Tesla. He had a very famous quote. He said, if you want to understand the

1:37:44.960 --> 1:37:52.960
 universe, think in terms of energy, vibration, and frequency. And it gets you thinking about

1:37:52.960 --> 1:37:58.320
 what is the universe? And of course, the universe is just all energy. And then what is matter?

1:37:58.880 --> 1:38:06.880
 Matter is low frequency energy. And what are we? You know, we're vibrating, you know, ashes to ashes,

1:38:06.880 --> 1:38:16.000
 dust to dust. I can turn a tree into light. I can turn light back into a tree. If I consider

1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:20.640
 the entire universe, and it's very important because we don't really think this way. Let's

1:38:20.640 --> 1:38:29.120
 take the New York disco model. If I walk into a nightclub and there's loud music blaring in

1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:37.520
 New York City, what's really going on there, right? If you blast out 15, 14 billion years ago,

1:38:37.520 --> 1:38:43.200
 the universe is formed. Okay, that's a low frequency thing. The universe formed a billion

1:38:43.200 --> 1:38:50.240
 years ago, the sun, maybe the earth, or form. The continents are 400 million years old. The schist

1:38:50.240 --> 1:38:55.520
 that New York City is on is some hundreds of millions of years. But the Hudson River is only

1:38:55.520 --> 1:39:02.960
 20,000 years. There's a building that's probably 50 years old. There's a company operating that

1:39:02.960 --> 1:39:09.680
 disco or that club, which is five to 10 years old. There's a person, a customer walking in there

1:39:09.680 --> 1:39:17.760
 for an experience for a few hours. There's music that's oscillating at some kilohertz. And then

1:39:17.760 --> 1:39:26.400
 there's light. And you have all forms of energy, all frequencies, all layered, all moving through

1:39:26.400 --> 1:39:33.520
 different medium. And how you perceive the world is the question of at what frequency do you want

1:39:33.520 --> 1:39:44.480
 to perceive the world. And I think that once you start to think that way, you're catalyzed to think

1:39:44.480 --> 1:39:53.120
 about what would digital energy look like? And why would I want it? And what is it? So

1:39:54.560 --> 1:40:00.160
 why don't we just start right there? What is it? The most famous manifestation of digital energy

1:40:00.160 --> 1:40:06.560
 is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a crypto asset. It's a crypto asset that has monetary value.

1:40:06.560 --> 1:40:17.200
 Can we just link on that? Bitcoin is a digital asset that has monetary value.

1:40:18.480 --> 1:40:23.920
 What is a digital asset? What is monetary? Why use those terms versus the words of

1:40:23.920 --> 1:40:29.760
 money and currency? Is there something interesting in that disambiguation of different terms?

1:40:29.760 --> 1:40:39.760
 I'd call it a crypto asset network. The goal is to create a billion dollar block of pure energy

1:40:39.760 --> 1:40:47.840
 in cyberspace. One that I could then move with no friction at the speed of light.

1:40:49.440 --> 1:40:56.320
 It's the equivalent to putting a million pounds in orbit. How do I actually launch

1:40:56.320 --> 1:41:02.160
 something into orbit? How do I launch something into cyberspace such that it moves friction free?

1:41:02.160 --> 1:41:10.160
 And the solution is a decentralized proof of work network. Satoshi's solution was,

1:41:10.880 --> 1:41:17.280
 I'm going to establish a protocol running on a distributed set of computers that will maintain

1:41:17.280 --> 1:41:24.800
 a constant supply of never more than 21 million Bitcoin subdividable by 100 million Satoshis each.

1:41:24.800 --> 1:41:41.120
 Transferable via transferring private keys. Now, the innovation is to create that in an ethical,

1:41:42.320 --> 1:41:49.280
 durable fashion. The ethical innovation is I want it to be property and not a security.

1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:58.400
 A bushel of corn, an acre of land, a stack of lumber and a bar of gold and a Bitcoin are all

1:41:58.400 --> 1:42:04.240
 property. And that means they're all commonly occurring elements in the world. You could call

1:42:04.240 --> 1:42:08.240
 them commodities, but commodity is a little bit misleading and I'll tell you why in a second.

1:42:08.880 --> 1:42:15.040
 But they're all distinguished by the fact that no one entity or person or government controls them.

1:42:15.040 --> 1:42:22.560
 If you have a barrel of oil and you're in Ukraine versus Russia versus Saudi Arabia versus the U.S.,

1:42:23.600 --> 1:42:32.560
 you have a barrel of oil. And it doesn't matter what the premier in Japan or the mayor of Miami

1:42:32.560 --> 1:42:39.200
 Beach thinks about your barrel of oil. They cannot wave their hand and make it not a barrel of oil

1:42:39.200 --> 1:42:47.680
 or a cord of wood, right? And so property is just a naturally occurring element in the universe,

1:42:48.400 --> 1:42:55.760
 right? Why use the word ethical? Sorry to, I may interrupt occasionally. Why ethical assigned

1:42:55.760 --> 1:43:03.440
 to property? Because if it's a security, a security would be an example of a share of a stock

1:43:03.440 --> 1:43:11.920
 or a crypto token controlled by a small team. And in the event that something is a security because

1:43:12.720 --> 1:43:19.280
 some small group or some identifiable group can control its nature, character, or supply,

1:43:20.880 --> 1:43:28.560
 then it really only becomes ethical to promote it or sell it pursuant to fair disclosures.

1:43:28.560 --> 1:43:36.400
 So I give you maybe practical example. I'm the mayor of Chicago. I give a speech. My speech,

1:43:36.400 --> 1:43:42.160
 I say, I think everybody in Chicago should own their own farm and have chicken, a chicken in the

1:43:42.160 --> 1:43:50.240
 backyard and their own horse and an automobile. That's ethical. I give the same speech and I say,

1:43:50.240 --> 1:43:56.960
 I think everybody in Chicago should buy Twitter stock, sell their house, or sell their house,

1:43:56.960 --> 1:44:04.080
 or sell their cash and buy Twitter stock. Is that ethical? Not really. But at that point,

1:44:04.080 --> 1:44:08.240
 you've entered into a conflict of interest because what you're doing is you're promoting

1:44:09.120 --> 1:44:15.120
 an asset which is substantially controlled by a small group of people, the board of directors or

1:44:15.120 --> 1:44:20.960
 the CEO of the company. So how would you feel if the president of the United States said,

1:44:20.960 --> 1:44:27.920
 I really think Americans should all buy Apple stock, especially if you work to Google.

1:44:27.920 --> 1:44:34.960
 But you worked anywhere. You'd be like, why isn't he saying buy mine? Right? A security is a

1:44:34.960 --> 1:44:42.720
 proprietary asset in some way, shape, or form. And the whole nature of securities law, it starts from

1:44:42.720 --> 1:44:53.760
 this ancient idea, thou shalt not lie, cheat, or steal. Okay? So if I'm going to sell you securities

1:44:53.760 --> 1:44:59.840
 or I'm going to promote securities as a public figure or as an influencer or anybody else,

1:45:01.280 --> 1:45:08.400
 if I create my own yo yo coin or Mikey coin, and then there's a million of them, and I tell you

1:45:08.400 --> 1:45:13.120
 that I think that it's a really good thing, and Mikey coin will go up forever, right? And everybody

1:45:13.120 --> 1:45:19.680
 buys Mikey coin, and then I give 10 million to you and don't tell the public, right? I've cheated

1:45:19.680 --> 1:45:26.080
 them. Maybe if I have Mikey coin, and I think there's only 2 million Mikey coin, and I swear

1:45:26.080 --> 1:45:31.440
 to you, there's only 2 million, and then I get married, and I have three kids, and my third kid

1:45:31.440 --> 1:45:37.200
 is in the hospital, and my kid's going to die, and I have this ethical reason to print 500,000

1:45:37.200 --> 1:45:41.920
 more Mikey coin or else people are going to die, and everybody tells me it's fine. You know,

1:45:41.920 --> 1:45:50.720
 I've still abused, you know, the investor, right? It's an ethical challenge. If you look at ethics

1:45:50.720 --> 1:45:58.960
 laws everywhere in the world, they all boil down to having a clause which says that if you're a

1:45:58.960 --> 1:46:05.120
 public figure, you can't endorse a security. You can't endorse something that would cause you to

1:46:05.120 --> 1:46:10.960
 have a conflict of interest. So if you're a mayor, a governor, a country, a public figure, an

1:46:10.960 --> 1:46:19.040
 influencer, and you want to promote or promulgate or support something using any public influence

1:46:19.040 --> 1:46:27.360
 or funds or resources you may have, it needs to be property. It can't be security. So it goes

1:46:27.360 --> 1:46:33.760
 beyond that, right? I mean, like would the Chinese want to support an American company, right? As

1:46:33.760 --> 1:46:40.880
 soon as you look at what's in the best interest of the human race, the civilization, you realize

1:46:40.880 --> 1:46:50.240
 that if you want an ethical path forward, it needs to be based on common property, which is fair.

1:46:50.720 --> 1:46:56.800
 And the way you get to a common property is through an open permissionless protocol. If it's

1:46:56.800 --> 1:47:01.120
 not open, right, if it's proprietary, and I know what the code says, and you don't know what the

1:47:01.120 --> 1:47:10.800
 code says, that makes it a security. If it's permissioned, if you're not allowed on my network,

1:47:10.800 --> 1:47:16.560
 or if you can be censored or booted off my network, that also makes it a security.

1:47:19.440 --> 1:47:25.920
 So when I talk about property, I mean, the challenge here is how do I create something

1:47:25.920 --> 1:47:35.520
 that's equivalent to a barrel of oil in cyberspace? And that means it has to be a nonsovereign bearer

1:47:35.520 --> 1:47:45.440
 instrument, open, permissionless, not censorable, right? If I could do that, then I could deliver

1:47:45.440 --> 1:47:54.240
 you 10,000 dematerialized barrels of oil, and you would take settlement of them, and you would know

1:47:54.240 --> 1:48:00.240
 that you have possession of that property, irregardless of the opinion of any politician

1:48:00.240 --> 1:48:08.240
 or any company or anybody else in the world. That's a really critical characteristic. And

1:48:08.240 --> 1:48:14.480
 it actually is, it's probably one of the fundamental things that makes Bitcoin special.

1:48:14.480 --> 1:48:19.120
 Bitcoin isn't just a crypto asset network. It's easy to create a crypto asset network.

1:48:19.120 --> 1:48:29.120
 It's very hard to create an ethical crypto asset network, because you have to create one

1:48:29.760 --> 1:48:37.440
 without any government or corporation or investor exercising in due influence to make it successful.

1:48:37.440 --> 1:48:47.680
 So open, permissionless, noncensorable. So basically no way for you without explicitly

1:48:47.680 --> 1:48:54.240
 saying so, outsourcing control to somebody else. So it's a kind of, you have full control.

1:48:54.960 --> 1:49:01.360
 Even with a barrel of oil, what's the difference between a barrel of oil and a Bitcoin to you?

1:49:03.360 --> 1:49:09.600
 Because you kind of mentioned that both are property. You mentioned Russia and China and

1:49:09.600 --> 1:49:14.960
 so on. Is it the ability of the government to confiscate? In the end, governments can

1:49:14.960 --> 1:49:21.280
 probably confiscate no matter what the asset is, but you want to lessen the effort involved.

1:49:21.280 --> 1:49:27.680
 A barrel of oil is a bucket of physical property, liquid property, and Bitcoin is a digital property.

1:49:27.680 --> 1:49:31.360
 But it's easier to confiscate a barrel of oil.

1:49:32.320 --> 1:49:38.640
 It's easier to confiscate things in the real world than things in cyberspace. Much easier.

1:49:38.640 --> 1:49:43.120
 So that's not universally true. Some things in the digital space are actually easier to

1:49:43.120 --> 1:49:50.000
 confiscate because just the nature of how things move easily with information, right?

1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:55.520
 So I think in the Bitcoin world, what we would say is that Bitcoin is the most difficult

1:49:56.160 --> 1:50:02.640
 property that the human race possesses or has yet invented to confiscate. And that's

1:50:02.640 --> 1:50:06.560
 by virtue of the fact that you could take possession of it via your private keys.

1:50:06.560 --> 1:50:13.200
 So if you got your 12 seed phrases in your head, then that would be the highest form of property,

1:50:13.200 --> 1:50:18.960
 right? Because I literally have to crack your head open and read your mind to take it.

1:50:18.960 --> 1:50:25.360
 It doesn't mean I couldn't extract it from you under duress, but it means that it's harder than

1:50:25.360 --> 1:50:30.960
 every other thing you might own. In fact, it's exponentially harder. If you consider every other

1:50:30.960 --> 1:50:38.800
 thing you might own, a car, a house, a share of stock, gold, diamonds, property rights,

1:50:38.800 --> 1:50:44.320
 intellectual property rights, movie rights, music rights, anything imaginable, they would all be

1:50:44.320 --> 1:50:51.520
 easier by orders and orders of magnitude to seize. So digital property in the form of a

1:50:53.360 --> 1:50:57.120
 set of private keys is by far the apex property of the human race.

1:50:57.120 --> 1:51:02.960
 In terms of ethics, I want to make one more point. I might say to you, Lex, I think Bitcoin is the

1:51:02.960 --> 1:51:08.320
 best, most secure, most durable crypto asset network in the world. It's going to go up forever,

1:51:08.320 --> 1:51:12.880
 and there's nothing better in the world. I might be right. I might be wrong.

1:51:14.480 --> 1:51:21.040
 But the point is, because it's property, it's ethical for me to say that if I were to turn

1:51:21.040 --> 1:51:27.520
 around and say, you know, Lex, I think the same about microstrategy stock, MSTR. That's a security.

1:51:27.520 --> 1:51:36.320
 Okay? If I'm wrong about that, I have civil liability or other liability because I could go

1:51:36.320 --> 1:51:40.800
 to a board meeting tomorrow and I could actually propose we issue a million more shares of

1:51:40.800 --> 1:51:48.560
 microstrategy stock, whereas the thing that makes Bitcoin ethical for me to even promote is the

1:51:48.560 --> 1:51:56.240
 knowledge that I can't change it. If I knew that I could make it 42 million instead of 21 million

1:51:56.240 --> 1:52:04.320
 and I had the button back here, right, then I have a different degree of ethical responsibility.

1:52:04.320 --> 1:52:08.480
 Now, I could tell you your life will be better if you buy Bitcoin, and it might not. You might go

1:52:08.480 --> 1:52:12.960
 buy Bitcoin, you might lose the keys and be bankrupt and your life ends and your life is not

1:52:12.960 --> 1:52:19.840
 better because you bought Bitcoin, right? But it wouldn't be my ethical liability any more than if

1:52:19.840 --> 1:52:26.480
 I were to say, Lex, I think you ought to get a farm. I think you should be a farmer. I think a

1:52:26.480 --> 1:52:31.680
 chicken in every pot, you should get a horse. I think you'd be better. I mean, these are all

1:52:32.480 --> 1:52:40.000
 opinions expressed about property, which may or may not be right, that you may or may not agree with,

1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:47.120
 but in a legal sense, if we read the law, if we understand securities law, and I would say,

1:52:47.120 --> 1:52:52.400
 you know, most people in the crypto industry, you know, they didn't take companies public,

1:52:52.400 --> 1:52:55.920
 and so they're not really focused on the securities law. They don't even know the securities law.

1:52:57.120 --> 1:53:03.040
 If you focus on the securities law, that would say you just can't legally sell this stuff to

1:53:03.040 --> 1:53:10.640
 the general public or promote it without a full set of continuing disclosures signed off on by

1:53:10.640 --> 1:53:18.640
 a regulator. So there's a fairly bright line there with regard to securities. But when you get to the

1:53:19.600 --> 1:53:29.360
 secondary issue, it's how do you actually build a world based on digital property if public figures

1:53:29.360 --> 1:53:36.880
 can't embrace it or endorse it? You see, so you're not going to build a better world based upon

1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:44.000
 Twitter stock, if that's your idea of property, because Twitter stock is a security and Twitter

1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:50.240
 stock is never going to be a non sovereign bearer instrument in Russia, right, or in China, right?

1:53:50.240 --> 1:53:55.680
 It's not even legal in China, right? So it's not a global permissionless open thing. It will never

1:53:55.680 --> 1:54:02.320
 be trusted by the rest of the world. And legally, it's impractical. But, you know, would you really

1:54:02.320 --> 1:54:06.880
 want to put $100 trillion worth of economic value on Twitter stock if there's a board of directors

1:54:06.880 --> 1:54:12.720
 and a CEO that could just get up and like take half of it tomorrow? The answer is no. So if you

1:54:12.720 --> 1:54:20.000
 want to build a better world based on digital energy, you need to start with constructing a

1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:28.480
 digital property. And I'm using property here and open permissionless in a legal sense. Okay,

1:54:28.480 --> 1:54:37.280
 but I would also go to the next step and say property is low frequency money. So if you if I

1:54:37.280 --> 1:54:44.640
 give you a million dollars, and you want to hold it for a decade, you might go buy a house with it.

1:54:44.640 --> 1:54:51.120
 Right. And the house is low frequency money, you converted the the million dollars of economic

1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:57.040
 energy into a structure called a house. Maybe an after a decade, you might convert it back into

1:54:57.040 --> 1:55:03.040
 energy, you might sell the house for currency. And it'll be more worth more or less depending

1:55:03.040 --> 1:55:10.080
 upon the monetary climate. The frequency means what here? How quickly it changes state? How

1:55:10.080 --> 1:55:21.200
 quickly does something vibrate? So if I transfer $10 from me to you for a drink, and then you turn

1:55:21.200 --> 1:55:26.720
 around, you buy another right, we're vibrating on a frequency of every few hours, right? The energy

1:55:26.720 --> 1:55:32.960
 is changing hands. But it's not likely that you sell and buy houses every few hours. Right? The

1:55:32.960 --> 1:55:39.920
 frequency of a transaction in real estate is every 10 years, every five years, it's a much lower

1:55:39.920 --> 1:55:49.600
 frequency transaction. And so when you think about what's going on here, you have extremely low

1:55:49.600 --> 1:55:58.160
 frequency things, which we'll call property, then you have mid frequency things, I'm going to call

1:55:58.160 --> 1:56:05.840
 them money or currency. And then you have high frequency, that's energy. And that's why I use

1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:11.440
 the illustration of you got the building, you got the light, and you got the sound, and they're all

1:56:11.440 --> 1:56:22.160
 just energy moving at different frequencies. Now, Bitcoin is magical. And it is truly the innovation.

1:56:22.160 --> 1:56:28.240
 It's like a singularity, because it represents the first time in the history of human race

1:56:28.240 --> 1:56:36.160
 that we managed to create a digital property, properly understood. It's easy to create something

1:56:37.040 --> 1:56:45.120
 digital, right? Every coupon and every scan on Fortnite and Roblox and Apple TV credits and all

1:56:45.120 --> 1:56:51.040
 these things, they're all digital something, but they're securities. And that's why I use the

1:56:51.040 --> 1:56:56.480
 word something, but they're securities, right? Shares of stock are securities. Whenever anybody

1:56:56.480 --> 1:57:01.360
 transfers, when you transfer money on PayPal or Apple Pay, you're transferring in essence a

1:57:01.360 --> 1:57:11.280
 security or an IOU. And so transferring a bearer instrument with final settlement in the internet

1:57:11.280 --> 1:57:18.880
 domain or in cyberspace, that's a critical thing. And anybody in the crypto world can do that.

1:57:18.880 --> 1:57:24.320
 All the crypto is going to do that. But what they can't do, what 99% of them fail to do,

1:57:24.320 --> 1:57:29.280
 is be property. They're securities, correct? Well, there's a line there I'd like to explore

1:57:29.280 --> 1:57:36.000
 a little further. For example, what about when you, like Coinbase or something like that,

1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:43.760
 when there's an exchange that you buy Bitcoin in, you start to move away from this kind of,

1:57:43.760 --> 1:57:51.600
 some of the aspects that you said makes up a property, which is this

1:57:53.840 --> 1:58:01.520
 noncensorable and permissionless and open. So in order to achieve the convenience,

1:58:01.520 --> 1:58:10.960
 the effectiveness of the transfer of energy, you have to leverage some of these places that remove

1:58:10.960 --> 1:58:16.240
 the aspects of property. So maybe you can comment on that. Let me give you a good model for that.

1:58:16.960 --> 1:58:23.920
 If you think about the layer one of Bitcoin, the layer one is the property settlement layer,

1:58:23.920 --> 1:58:29.760
 and we're going to do 350,000 transactions or less a day, 100 million transactions a year is

1:58:29.760 --> 1:58:36.480
 the bandwidth on the layer one. And it would be an ideal layer one to move a billion dollars from

1:58:36.480 --> 1:58:43.200
 point A to point B with the massive security. The role of the layer one is two things.

1:58:44.080 --> 1:58:51.520
 One thing is I want to move a large sum of money through space with security. I can move

1:58:52.560 --> 1:59:00.720
 any amount of Bitcoin in a matter of minutes for dollars on layer one. The second important

1:59:00.720 --> 1:59:06.960
 feature of the layer one is I need the money to last forever. I need the money indestructible,

1:59:06.960 --> 1:59:13.440
 immortal. So the bigger trick is not to move a billion dollars from here to Tokyo. The big trick

1:59:13.440 --> 1:59:22.320
 is to move a billion dollars from here to the year 2140. And that's what we want to solve with

1:59:22.320 --> 1:59:27.520
 layer one. And the best real metaphor in New York City would be the granite or the schist.

1:59:27.520 --> 1:59:34.800
 What you want is a city block of bedrock. And how long has it been there? Like millions of years

1:59:34.800 --> 1:59:40.640
 it's been there. And how fast do you want it to move? You don't. In fact, the single thing that's

1:59:40.640 --> 1:59:47.600
 most important is that it not deflect. If it deflects a foot in 100 years, it's too much.

1:59:47.600 --> 1:59:53.440
 If it deflects an inch in 100 years, you might not want that. So the layer one of Bitcoin is

1:59:53.440 --> 1:59:58.640
 a foundation upon which you put weight. How much weight can you put on it? You put a trillion,

1:59:58.640 --> 2:00:06.320
 10 trillion, 100 trillion, a quadrillion? How much weight's on the bedrock in Manhattan, right?

2:00:06.320 --> 2:00:14.560
 Think about 100 story buildings. So the real key there is the foundational asset needs to be there

2:00:14.560 --> 2:00:20.880
 at all. So the fact that you can create a hundred trillion dollar layer one that would stand for

2:00:20.880 --> 2:00:27.680
 100 years, that is the revolutionary breakthrough first time. And the fact that it's ethical,

2:00:27.680 --> 2:00:33.520
 right? It's ethical and it's common property, global, permissionless. Extremely unlikely that

2:00:33.520 --> 2:00:40.000
 would happen. People tried 50 times before and they all failed. They tried 15,000 times after,

2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:47.200
 and they've all generally failed. 98% have failed and a couple have been less successful. But

2:00:47.200 --> 2:00:52.240
 for the most part, that's an extraordinary thing. Now,

2:00:52.240 --> 2:00:58.880
 just really quickly pause just to define some terms. If people don't know, layer one is that

2:00:58.880 --> 2:01:06.560
 Michael's referring to is in general what people know of as the Bitcoin technology originally

2:01:06.560 --> 2:01:11.840
 defined, which is the blockchain. There's a consensus mechanism of proof of work,

2:01:11.840 --> 2:01:20.000
 low number of transactions, but you can move a very large amount of money. The reason he's

2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:25.120
 using the term layer one is now that there's a lot of ideas of layer two technologies built on top

2:01:25.120 --> 2:01:30.400
 of this bedrock that allow you to move a much larger number of transactions,

2:01:33.600 --> 2:01:38.800
 sort of higher frequency. I don't know what terminology you want to use, but basically be

2:01:38.800 --> 2:01:45.840
 able to use now something that is based on Bitcoin to then buy stuff, be a consumer,

2:01:45.840 --> 2:01:51.040
 to transfer money, to use it as currency, just to define some terms.

2:01:51.040 --> 2:02:02.960
 Yeah, so the layer one is the foundation for the entire cyber economy, and we don't want it to move

2:02:02.960 --> 2:02:13.280
 fast. What we want is immortality, immortal, incorruptible, indestructible, right? That's

2:02:13.280 --> 2:02:18.640
 what you want, integrity from the layer one. Now there's layer two and layer three, and layer

2:02:18.640 --> 2:02:27.840
 two I would define as an open, permissionless, noncustodial protocol that uses the underlying

2:02:27.840 --> 2:02:35.520
 layer one token as its gas fee. So what's custodial mean and how does the different markets,

2:02:35.520 --> 2:02:41.680
 like is lightning network? So lightning network would be an example of a layer two, noncustodial.

2:02:41.680 --> 2:02:48.080
 So the lightning network will sit on top of layer one, it'll sit on top of Bitcoin,

2:02:48.640 --> 2:02:54.480
 and it solves the, what you want to do is solve the problem of it's well and fine, I don't want

2:02:54.480 --> 2:03:01.120
 to move a billion dollars every day, what I want to move is five dollars a billion times a day.

2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:07.520
 So if I want to move five dollars a billion times a day, I don't really need to put the entire

2:03:07.520 --> 2:03:15.120
 trillion dollars of assets at risk every time I move five dollars. All I really need to do is put

2:03:15.680 --> 2:03:19.840
 a hundred thousand dollars in a channel or a million dollars in a channel, and then I do

2:03:19.840 --> 2:03:25.120
 ten million transactions where I have a million dollars at risk. And of course it's kind of

2:03:25.120 --> 2:03:32.480
 simple, if I put, if I lower my security requirement by a factor of a million,

2:03:33.040 --> 2:03:37.920
 I could probably move the stuff a million times faster, right? And that's how lightning works.

2:03:38.480 --> 2:03:46.160
 It's noncustodial because there's no corporation or custodian or counterparty you're trusting,

2:03:46.160 --> 2:03:53.840
 right? There's the risk of moving through the channel. But lightning is an example of how I go

2:03:53.840 --> 2:04:00.640
 from 350,000 transactions a day to 350 million transactions a day. So on that layer too, you

2:04:00.640 --> 2:04:07.280
 could move the Bitcoin in seconds for fractions of pennies. Now that's not the end all be all,

2:04:07.280 --> 2:04:12.240
 because the truth is there are a lot of open protocols. Lightning probably won't be the only

2:04:12.240 --> 2:04:18.080
 one. You know, there's an open market competition of other permissionless open source protocols to

2:04:18.080 --> 2:04:28.160
 do this work. And in theory, any other crypto network that was deemed to be property, deemed to

2:04:28.160 --> 2:04:34.400
 be non a security, you could also think of as potentially a layer two to Bitcoin, right? There's

2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:38.640
 a debate about are there any and what are they, and we can leave that for a little bit of a

2:04:38.640 --> 2:04:43.360
 debate about are there any and what are they, and we can leave that for a later time.

2:04:43.360 --> 2:04:49.200
 But why do you think of them as layer two, as opposed to contending for layer one?

2:04:50.400 --> 2:04:55.920
 Yeah, actually, if they're using their own token, then they are a layer one. If you create an open

2:04:55.920 --> 2:05:05.040
 protocol that uses the Bitcoin token as the fee, then it becomes a layer two, right? Bitcoin itself,

2:05:05.040 --> 2:05:10.320
 right, incentivizes his own transactions with its own token, and that's what makes it layer one.

2:05:11.840 --> 2:05:13.840
 Okay, what's layer three, then?

2:05:13.840 --> 2:05:20.160
 Layer three is a custodial layer. So if you want to move Bitcoin in milliseconds for free,

2:05:21.360 --> 2:05:27.840
 you move it through Binance or Coinbase or Cash App. So this is a very straightforward thing. I

2:05:27.840 --> 2:05:32.640
 mean, it seems pretty obvious when you think about it that there are going to be hundreds of thousands

2:05:32.640 --> 2:05:39.600
 of layer threes. There may be dozens of layer twos. I mean, Lightning is a one, but it's not the only

2:05:39.600 --> 2:05:48.720
 one. Anybody can invent something, right? And we can have this debate about custodial, noncustodial.

2:05:50.720 --> 2:05:56.240
 Don't you think there's a monopolization possibilities at layer three?

2:05:56.240 --> 2:06:03.200
 So, you know, Coin, you mentioned Binance, Coinbase. What if they start to dominate,

2:06:03.200 --> 2:06:09.120
 and basically everybody's using them, practically speaking, and then it becomes too costly to

2:06:09.840 --> 2:06:18.160
 memorize the private key in your brain? I mean, or like the cold storage of layer one technology.

2:06:18.160 --> 2:06:23.920
 The idealists fear the layer threes because they think, and especially they detest,

2:06:23.920 --> 2:06:28.960
 they would detest it. There's almost like a layer four, by the way, if you want to.

2:06:28.960 --> 2:06:34.640
 A layer four would be, I've got Bitcoin on an application, but I can't withdraw it.

2:06:35.600 --> 2:06:39.760
 So I've got an application that's backed by Bitcoin, but the Bitcoin is sealed.

2:06:40.560 --> 2:06:44.240
 It's a proprietary example. And I'll give you an example of that. That would be like

2:06:44.240 --> 2:06:53.520
 Grayscale. If I own a share of GBTC, and so I own a security, actually, you know, you could own MSTR.

2:06:54.240 --> 2:06:59.600
 If you own a security or you own a product that has Bitcoin embedded in it, you get the benefits

2:06:59.600 --> 2:07:04.240
 of Bitcoin, but you don't have the ability to withdraw the asset.

2:07:04.240 --> 2:07:09.040
 To get out of the security market at layer four? Am I understanding this correctly?

2:07:09.040 --> 2:07:15.120
 I don't know if I would say, I don't, not all securities are layer four, but anything that's

2:07:15.120 --> 2:07:21.680
 a proprietary product based upon what with Bitcoin embedded in it, where you can't withdraw the

2:07:21.680 --> 2:07:29.120
 Bitcoin is another application of Bitcoin. So if you think about different ways you can use this,

2:07:29.840 --> 2:07:34.960
 you can either stay completely on the layer one and use the base chain for your transactions,

2:07:34.960 --> 2:07:41.040
 or you can limit yourself to layer one and layer two lightning. And the purist would say we stay

2:07:41.040 --> 2:07:46.400
 there, get your Bitcoin off the exchange. But you could also go to the layer three.

2:07:46.400 --> 2:07:51.840
 When Cash App supported Bitcoin, they made it very easy to buy it, and then they gave you the

2:07:51.840 --> 2:07:56.800
 ability to withdraw. When PayPal or I think Robinhood let you buy it, they wouldn't let

2:07:56.800 --> 2:08:01.200
 you withdraw it, and there was a big community uproar, and people wanted to withdraw.

2:08:01.200 --> 2:08:06.000
 They want these layer threes to make it possible to withdraw the Bitcoin so you can take it to

2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:11.840
 your own private wallet and get it off the exchange. I think the answer to the question

2:08:11.840 --> 2:08:18.880
 of, well, is corruption possible? Corruption is possible in all human institutions and all

2:08:18.880 --> 2:08:25.200
 governments everywhere. The difference between digital property and physical property is when

2:08:25.200 --> 2:08:31.520
 you own a building in Los Angeles and the city politics turn against you, you can't move the

2:08:31.520 --> 2:08:39.760
 building. And when you own a share of a security that's like a U.S. traded security and you wish

2:08:39.760 --> 2:08:47.440
 to move to some other country, you can't take the security with you either. And when you own

2:08:47.440 --> 2:08:51.680
 a bunch of gold and you try to get through the airport, they might not let you take it.

2:08:51.680 --> 2:08:59.200
 So Bitcoin is advantageous versus all those because you actually do have the option to

2:08:59.200 --> 2:09:06.240
 withdraw your asset from the exchange. And if you had Bitcoin with Fidelity and you had shares of

2:09:06.240 --> 2:09:12.800
 stock with Fidelity, and if you had bonds and sovereign debt with Fidelity, and if you own some

2:09:12.800 --> 2:09:18.960
 mutual funds and some other random limited partnerships with Fidelity, none of those things

2:09:18.960 --> 2:09:25.040
 can be removed from the custodian. But the Bitcoin, you can take off the exchange, you can remove

2:09:25.040 --> 2:09:36.080
 from the custodian. So there's a deterrent that's an anti corrupting element. And the phrase is an

2:09:36.080 --> 2:09:43.440
 armed society is a polite society, right? Because you have the optionality to withdraw all your

2:09:43.440 --> 2:09:50.320
 assets from the crypto exchange, you can enforce fairness. And at the point where you disagree

2:09:50.320 --> 2:09:56.720
 with their policies, you can within an hour, move your assets to another counterparty or take

2:09:56.720 --> 2:10:02.960
 personal custody of those assets. And you don't have that option to withdraw all your assets.

2:10:02.960 --> 2:10:08.480
 And you don't have that option with most other forms of property. Maybe you don't have as much

2:10:08.480 --> 2:10:14.640
 optionality with any other form of property on Earth. And so what makes digital property distinct

2:10:15.600 --> 2:10:22.800
 is the fact that it has the most optionality for custody. Now coming back to this digital energy

2:10:22.800 --> 2:10:30.960
 issue, the real key point is the energy moves in milliseconds for free on layer threes. It moves in

2:10:30.960 --> 2:10:39.600
 seconds or less than seconds on layer twos, it moves in minutes on the layer one. And I don't

2:10:39.600 --> 2:10:44.880
 think it makes any sense to even think about trying to solve all three problems on the layer one

2:10:44.880 --> 2:10:51.600
 because it's impossible to achieve the security and the incorruptibility and immortality if you

2:10:51.600 --> 2:10:58.480
 try to build that much speed and that functionality and performance. In fact, if you come back to the

2:10:58.480 --> 2:11:04.640
 New York model, you really wanted a block of granite, a building and a company. That's what

2:11:04.640 --> 2:11:10.400
 makes the economy, right? If I said to you, you're going to build a building, but you can only have

2:11:10.400 --> 2:11:16.240
 one company in it for the life of the building, it would be very fragile, like very brittle. What

2:11:16.240 --> 2:11:21.680
 company a hundred years ago is still relevant today? You want all three layers because they

2:11:21.680 --> 2:11:29.360
 all oscillate at different frequencies. And there's a tendency to think, well, it's got to be

2:11:29.360 --> 2:11:35.760
 this L1 or that L1, not really. And sometimes people think, well, I don't really want any L3.

2:11:36.560 --> 2:11:44.240
 But companies, it's not an even or, companies are better than crypto asset networks at certain

2:11:44.240 --> 2:11:49.280
 things. If you want complexity, you want to implement complexity, or you want to implement

2:11:49.280 --> 2:12:00.880
 compliance or customer service, right? Companies do these things well, right? You couldn't

2:12:00.880 --> 2:12:07.680
 decentralize Apple or Netflix or even YouTube. The performance wouldn't be there and the subtlety

2:12:07.680 --> 2:12:14.640
 wouldn't be there. And you can't really legally decentralize certain forms of banking and insurance

2:12:14.640 --> 2:12:19.440
 because they will become illegal in the political jurisdiction they're in. So, unless you're a

2:12:19.440 --> 2:12:27.440
 crypto anarchist and you believe in no companies and no nation states, right? Which is just not

2:12:27.440 --> 2:12:33.680
 very practical, not anytime soon. Once you allow that nation states will continue and companies

2:12:33.680 --> 2:12:43.120
 have a role, then the layered architecture follows and the free market determines who wins.

2:12:43.120 --> 2:12:50.320
 For example, there are layer threes that let you acquire Bitcoin and withdraw Bitcoin.

2:12:51.760 --> 2:12:58.640
 There are other applications that let you acquire but not withdraw it. And they don't get the same

2:12:58.640 --> 2:13:04.560
 market share, but they might give you some other advantage. There are certain layer threes like

2:13:04.560 --> 2:13:10.800
 Jack Dorsey's Cash App, where they just incorporated lightning, an implementation of it.

2:13:10.800 --> 2:13:21.120
 So, that makes it more, that makes it advantageous versus an application that doesn't incorporate

2:13:21.120 --> 2:13:28.640
 lightning. If you think about the big picture, the big picture is 8 billion people with mobile phones

2:13:28.640 --> 2:13:38.080
 served by 100 million companies doing billions of transactions an hour. And the companies are

2:13:38.080 --> 2:13:45.200
 settling with each other on the base layer in blocks of 80 million at a time. And then the

2:13:45.200 --> 2:13:54.480
 companies are trading with the consumers, right, in proprietary layers, like layer three. And then

2:13:55.040 --> 2:14:00.800
 on occasion, people are shuffling assets across custodians with lightning layer two,

2:14:00.800 --> 2:14:06.080
 because you don't want to pay $5 to move $50. You want to pay a 20th of a penny.

2:14:06.080 --> 2:14:15.440
 You want to pay a 20th of a penny to move $50. And so, all of these things create efficiency

2:14:15.440 --> 2:14:21.600
 in the economy. And, Lex, if you want to consider how much efficiency, if you gave me a billion

2:14:21.600 --> 2:14:28.080
 dollars in 20 years, I couldn't find a way to trade with another company or a counterparty in Nigeria.

2:14:28.080 --> 2:14:37.040
 Like, no amount of money. Give me $10 billion. I couldn't do it because you get shut down at

2:14:37.040 --> 2:14:43.520
 the banking level. You can't link up a bank in Nigeria with a bank in the US. You get shut down

2:14:43.520 --> 2:14:47.360
 at this credit card level because they don't have the credit card, so they won't clear.

2:14:47.360 --> 2:14:57.600
 You would get shut down at the compliance FCPA level because, you know, you wouldn't be able to

2:14:57.600 --> 2:15:02.000
 implement a system that interfaced with somebody else's system if it's not in the right political

2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:08.080
 jurisdiction. On the other hand, three entrepreneurs in Nigeria on the weekend could

2:15:08.080 --> 2:15:14.320
 create a website that would trade in this lightning economy using open protocols without asking

2:15:14.320 --> 2:15:19.600
 anybody's permission. So, you're talking about something that's, like, a million times cheaper,

2:15:20.160 --> 2:15:26.880
 less friction, and faster to do it if you want to get money to move.

2:15:27.520 --> 2:15:31.040
 What do you think that looks like so that now there's a war going on in Ukraine,

2:15:31.680 --> 2:15:40.560
 there's other wars, Yemen, going out throughout the world in this most difficult of states that

2:15:40.560 --> 2:15:47.600
 a nation can be in, which is a war, a civil war, or war with other nations? What's the role of

2:15:47.600 --> 2:15:55.680
 Bitcoin in this context? I mean, Bitcoin's a universal trust protocol, right? A universal

2:15:55.680 --> 2:16:02.880
 energy protocol, if you will. English is one, okay? What I see is a bunch of fragmentation

2:16:02.880 --> 2:16:08.240
 of applications. For example, you know, the Russian payment app is not going to work in

2:16:08.240 --> 2:16:14.000
 Ukraine. The Ukraine payment app is not going to work in Russia. You know, US payment apps won't

2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:20.720
 work either of those places, as far as I know. So, you know, and in Argentina, their payment

2:16:20.720 --> 2:16:29.200
 app may not work in certain parts of Africa. So, what you have is different local economies

2:16:29.200 --> 2:16:35.280
 where people spin up their own applications compliant with their own local laws, or,

2:16:35.280 --> 2:16:41.280
 you know, in war zones, not compliant, but just spinning up, you know?

2:16:41.280 --> 2:16:47.600
 So, how do you build something that's not compliant? What is the revolutionary act here

2:16:47.600 --> 2:16:52.560
 when you don't agree with the government or what you want to free yourself from the constitution?

2:16:52.560 --> 2:17:01.200
 So, here's the thing. When a nation is really at war, especially if it's an authoritarian regime,

2:17:01.200 --> 2:17:06.160
 it's going to try to control the pop, like lock everything down, the spread of information.

2:17:06.160 --> 2:17:09.920
 How do you break through that? Do you do the thing that you mentioned, which is you have to build

2:17:09.920 --> 2:17:17.200
 another app, essentially, that allows the flow of money outside the legal constraints placed on you

2:17:17.200 --> 2:17:22.000
 by the government? So, basically, break the law? Is that possible?

2:17:22.000 --> 2:17:25.600
 Metaphorically speaking, if you want to break out of the constraints of your culture,

2:17:25.600 --> 2:17:30.960
 you learn to speak English. For example, it's not illegal to speak English, or even if it is,

2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:36.160
 right? It doesn't matter, but English works everywhere in the world if you can speak it,

2:17:36.160 --> 2:17:43.760
 and then you can tap into a global commerce and intelligence network. So, Bitcoin is a language,

2:17:43.760 --> 2:17:49.440
 so you learn to speak Bitcoin, or you learn to speak Lightning, and then you tap into that network

2:17:49.440 --> 2:17:54.480
 in, you know, whatever manner you can. But the problem is it's still very difficult

2:17:54.480 --> 2:18:01.840
 to move Bitcoin around in Russia and Ukraine now, during the war. And there was a sense to me that

2:18:02.800 --> 2:18:08.880
 the cryptocurrency in general could be the savior for helping people. There's millions of refugees

2:18:08.880 --> 2:18:17.360
 that are moving all around. It's very difficult to move money around in that space to help people.

2:18:17.920 --> 2:18:23.200
 I think we're very early. Like, we're very embryonic here. If you look at the...

2:18:23.200 --> 2:18:28.240
 Who's we, sorry? We as a human civilization, or we operating in the cryptocurrency space?

2:18:28.240 --> 2:18:35.440
 I think the entire crypto economy is very embryonic, and the human race's adoption of it

2:18:35.440 --> 2:18:42.320
 is embryonic. We're like one, two percent down that adoption curve. If you take Lightning,

2:18:42.320 --> 2:18:47.440
 for example, you know, the first real commercial applications of Lightning are just in the last

2:18:47.440 --> 2:18:53.760
 12 months. So we're like year one. We might be approaching year two of commercial Lightning

2:18:53.760 --> 2:18:59.920
 adoption. And if you look at Lightning adoption, Lightning's not built into Coinbase, it's not

2:18:59.920 --> 2:19:07.600
 built into Binance, it's not built into FTX. Cash App just implemented the first implementation,

2:19:07.600 --> 2:19:12.960
 but not all the features are built into it. There's a few dozen, a dozen Lightning wallets

2:19:12.960 --> 2:19:19.600
 circulating out there. So I think that, you know, we're probably going to be 36 months of

2:19:19.600 --> 2:19:29.200
 software development. At the point that every Android phone and every iPhone has a Bitcoin

2:19:29.200 --> 2:19:36.400
 wallet or a crypto wallet in it of sorts, that's a big deal. If Apple embraced Lightning,

2:19:36.400 --> 2:19:44.720
 that's a big deal. So the adoption is the thing, like in a war zone adoption, the people who

2:19:44.720 --> 2:19:51.040
 struggle the most in war are people who weren't doing that great before the war started. They

2:19:51.040 --> 2:19:55.600
 don't have the technological sophistication. The hackers and all those kinds of people will find

2:19:55.600 --> 2:20:01.840
 a way. It's just regular people who are just struggling to make day by day living. And so

2:20:01.840 --> 2:20:09.840
 if the adoption permeates the entire culture, then you can start to move money around in the

2:20:09.840 --> 2:20:18.160
 digital space. If you can psychoanalyze Jack Dorsey for a second. So he's one of the early

2:20:18.160 --> 2:20:24.400
 adopters, or he's one of the people pushing the early adoption, this layer three, so inside Cash

2:20:24.400 --> 2:20:32.320
 App. What do you make of the man of this decision as a business owner, as somebody playing in the

2:20:32.320 --> 2:20:40.640
 space? Like what, why did he do it? And what does that mean for others at this scale that might be

2:20:40.640 --> 2:20:45.280
 doing the same? So incorporating Lightning networking, incorporating Bitcoin into their

2:20:45.280 --> 2:20:51.120
 products. I think he's been pretty clear about this. He feels that Bitcoin is an instrument of

2:20:51.120 --> 2:20:56.800
 economic empowerment for billions of people that are unbanked and have no property rights

2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:05.200
 in the world. If you want to give an incorruptible bank

2:21:07.600 --> 2:21:14.480
 to eight billion people on the planet, that's the same as asking the question,

2:21:14.480 --> 2:21:22.800
 how do you give a full education through PhD to eight billion people on the planet? And the answer

2:21:22.800 --> 2:21:31.120
 is a digital version of the 20th century thing running on a mobile phone. And Bitcoin is a bank

2:21:31.120 --> 2:21:34.800
 in cyberspace. It's run by incorruptible software and it's for everybody on earth.

2:21:35.600 --> 2:21:39.360
 So I think when Jack looks at it, he's very sensitive to the plight of everybody in Africa.

2:21:39.360 --> 2:21:43.280
 If you look at Africans, you're going to give them banks, you're not going to put a bank branch on

2:21:43.280 --> 2:21:47.840
 every corner. That's an obscene waste of energy. You're not going to run copper wires across the

2:21:47.840 --> 2:21:56.640
 continent. That's an obscene waste of energy. You're not going to give them gold. So how are

2:21:56.640 --> 2:22:03.840
 you going to provide people with a decent life? The metaphor I think is relevant here,

2:22:03.840 --> 2:22:09.520
 the biological metaphor, Lex, is a type one diabetic. If you're a type one diabetic,

2:22:09.520 --> 2:22:15.040
 you can't form fat. And if you can't form fat, then you can't store excess energy. So

2:22:15.840 --> 2:22:20.640
 that means that, I mean, fat is the ultimate organic battery. And if you've got 30 pounds of it,

2:22:20.640 --> 2:22:27.040
 you can go 60 days without eating. But if you can't generate insulin, you can't form fat cells.

2:22:27.040 --> 2:22:32.160
 And if you can't form fat cells and store energy, then you can eat yourself to death.

2:22:32.160 --> 2:22:37.840
 I mean, you will eat and you will die. You'll starve to death. So the lack of property rights

2:22:38.560 --> 2:22:44.800
 is like being a type one diabetic. And so if you look at most people everywhere in the world,

2:22:46.800 --> 2:22:52.640
 they don't have property rights, they don't have effective bank, and their currency is broken.

2:22:53.680 --> 2:22:57.360
 Like what are the two things that in theory would serve as the equivalent of a

2:22:57.360 --> 2:23:03.360
 organic battery or an economic battery to civilization? It would be, I have a currency

2:23:03.360 --> 2:23:12.080
 which holds its value and I can store it in a bank. So a risk free currency derivative.

2:23:13.920 --> 2:23:18.800
 I pay you your money, you take your life savings, you put it in a bank, you save up for your

2:23:18.800 --> 2:23:22.240
 retirement, you'll have happily ever after. That's the American dream.

2:23:22.240 --> 2:23:28.320
 Right? That's the idyllic situation. The real situation is there are no banks,

2:23:28.320 --> 2:23:34.960
 you can't get a bank account. So I give you your pay in currency, and then I double the supply and

2:23:34.960 --> 2:23:40.800
 I give it to my cousin, or I give it to whatever cause I want, or I use it to buy weapons. And then

2:23:40.800 --> 2:23:47.040
 you find a loaf of bread cost triple next month is what it costs. And your life savings is worthless.

2:23:47.040 --> 2:23:53.280
 And so in that environment, everybody's ripped back to Stone Age barter. And the problem with

2:23:53.280 --> 2:23:58.080
 that even Stone Age barter is you're going to carry your life savings on your back. And what

2:23:58.080 --> 2:24:01.600
 happens when the guy with a machine gun points it at your head and just takes your life savings.

2:24:01.600 --> 2:24:10.080
 So I think from Jack's point of view, he thinks that life is, this is maybe too strong, but these

2:24:10.080 --> 2:24:14.560
 are my words, life is hopeless. It's hopeless. It's hopeless. It's hopeless. It's hopeless.

2:24:14.560 --> 2:24:24.240
 It's hopeless for a lot of people. And Bitcoin is hope. Right? Because it gives everyone

2:24:26.800 --> 2:24:34.160
 an engineered monetary asset that's a bearer instrument. And it gives them a bank on their

2:24:34.160 --> 2:24:41.600
 mobile phone. And they don't have to trust their government or another counterparty

2:24:41.600 --> 2:24:50.400
 with their life force. So there's a secondary thing I think he's interested in, which is the

2:24:50.400 --> 2:24:57.680
 first thing is the human rights issue. And the second thing would be the friction to trade cross

2:24:57.680 --> 2:25:07.680
 borders is so great. Right? Like, you know, you like AI. So I'll give you a beautiful notion.

2:25:07.680 --> 2:25:14.560
 Maybe one day there'll be an artificially intelligent creature in cyberspace that is

2:25:14.560 --> 2:25:25.680
 self sufficient and rich. Like that, we would have sovereignty. Can a robot own money or property?

2:25:26.320 --> 2:25:32.240
 How about kind of Tesla car? Can I actually put enough money in a car for it to drive itself and

2:25:32.240 --> 2:25:38.400
 maintain itself forever? Or can I create an artificially intelligent creature in cyberspace

2:25:38.400 --> 2:25:43.840
 that is endowed such that it would live a thousand years and continue to do its job?

2:25:44.640 --> 2:25:50.400
 Right? You know, we have a word for that in the real world is institution, Harvard, Cambridge,

2:25:50.400 --> 2:25:55.040
 Stanford, right? There are institutions with endowments that go on in perpetuity.

2:25:55.040 --> 2:26:05.760
 But what if I wanted to perpetuate a software program? And with something like digital property

2:26:05.760 --> 2:26:15.440
 with Bitcoin and lightning, you could do it. And on the other hand, with banks and credit cards,

2:26:15.440 --> 2:26:23.760
 you couldn't, right? You couldn't ever. So, so you can create things that are beautiful and lasting.

2:26:25.200 --> 2:26:31.920
 And what's the difference in speed? Well, so I can either trade with everybody in the world

2:26:32.880 --> 2:26:41.200
 at the speed of light, friction free in 24 hours writing a Python script, or I can spend $100 billion

2:26:41.200 --> 2:26:48.560
 to trade with a few million people in the world after it takes them six months of application.

2:26:48.560 --> 2:26:56.080
 The impedance is like a 10 million to one difference, right? And the metaphors are

2:26:56.080 --> 2:27:02.880
 literally like launching something in orbit versus almost orbit or vacuum sealing something.

2:27:03.440 --> 2:27:07.120
 Does it last forever and does it orbit forever or does it go away?

2:27:07.120 --> 2:27:12.720
 Does it last forever and does it orbit forever or does it go up and come down and burn up?

2:27:13.760 --> 2:27:21.280
 Right. And I think Jack is interested in, you know, putting freedom in orbit. All right.

2:27:21.280 --> 2:27:22.960
 Putting freedom.

2:27:22.960 --> 2:27:26.400
 Putting freedom in orbit. And he said it many times. He said,

2:27:26.400 --> 2:27:34.640
 this is the internet needs a native currency. Right. And no political construct or security

2:27:34.640 --> 2:27:40.080
 can be a native currency. You need a property and you need a property that can be moved a million

2:27:40.080 --> 2:27:46.800
 times a second. Can you oscillate it at 10 kilohertz or a hundred kilohertz? And the answer

2:27:46.800 --> 2:27:54.880
 is only if it's a pure digital construct, permissionless and open. And so I think

2:27:54.880 --> 2:28:00.400
 that he's enthusiastic as the technologist and he's enthusiastic as the humanitarian.

2:28:00.400 --> 2:28:05.520
 And what he's doing is support both those areas. He's supporting the Bitcoin and the lightning

2:28:05.520 --> 2:28:09.920
 protocol by building them into his products, but he's also building the applications,

2:28:10.800 --> 2:28:17.280
 which you need at the cash app level in order to commercialize and deliver the functionality

2:28:17.280 --> 2:28:20.640
 and the compliance necessary and they're related.

2:28:21.760 --> 2:28:28.240
 And I should also say he's just a fascinating person. I, for a random reason that

2:28:28.240 --> 2:28:35.040
 I couldn't even explain. If I tried, I met him a few days ago and gave him a great big hug in the

2:28:35.040 --> 2:28:40.400
 middle of nowhere. There was no explanation. He just appeared. That's a fascinating human,

2:28:40.400 --> 2:28:46.400
 his relationship with art, with the world, with human suffering, with technology is fascinating.

2:28:47.760 --> 2:28:53.440
 I don't know what his path looks like, but it's interesting that people like that exist.

2:28:53.440 --> 2:28:59.360
 And in part, I'm saddened that he no longer is involved with Twitter directly as a CEO,

2:29:00.080 --> 2:29:07.200
 because I was hoping something inside Twitter would also integrate some of these ideas of what

2:29:07.200 --> 2:29:13.600
 you're calling digital energy to see how social networks, something I'm really interested in and

2:29:13.600 --> 2:29:18.320
 passionate about could be transformed. Let me ask you just for educational purposes,

2:29:18.320 --> 2:29:24.080
 what's the, can you please explain to me what web three and the beef between Jack and Mark

2:29:24.080 --> 2:29:30.560
 Andreessen is exactly? Did you see what happened? Sorry to have you analyze Twitter like it's

2:29:30.560 --> 2:29:36.480
 Shakespeare, but can you please explain to me why, why there was any, any drama over this topic?

2:29:37.440 --> 2:29:43.840
 First of all, web three is a term that's used to refer to, you know,

2:29:43.840 --> 2:29:49.280
 the part of the economy that's token financed. So if I'm launching an application and my idea

2:29:49.280 --> 2:29:55.600
 is to create a token along with the application and issue the token to the community so as to

2:29:55.600 --> 2:30:03.280
 finance the application and build support for it, I think that that's the most common

2:30:03.280 --> 2:30:08.000
 interpretation of web three. There are other interpretations too. So I'm just going to refer

2:30:08.000 --> 2:30:15.120
 to that one. And I think the beef in a nutshell, not articulated, but I'll articulate it is whether

2:30:15.120 --> 2:30:21.520
 or not you should focus all your energy creating applications on top of an ethical digital property

2:30:21.520 --> 2:30:32.320
 like Bitcoin, or whether you should attempt to create a competitor to it, which generally would

2:30:32.320 --> 2:30:38.000
 be deemed as a security by the Bitcoin community. So I'm going to put on my Bitcoin hat here. Yeah.

2:30:38.000 --> 2:30:42.720
 Right. All the tokens that are, if it's driven by a venture capitalist, well, it's a security.

2:30:42.720 --> 2:30:49.200
 If there's a CEO and a CTO, it's a security. All these projects, they're companies. Foundations

2:30:49.200 --> 2:30:55.600
 are companies, right? If you call them a project or a foundation, it doesn't make it not a security.

2:30:55.600 --> 2:31:02.400
 They're all, in essence, collections of individuals that are issuing equity in the form of a token.

2:31:03.360 --> 2:31:15.600
 And if there's a pre mine, an IPO, an ICO, a foundation, or any kind of protocol where there's

2:31:15.600 --> 2:31:21.840
 a group of engineers that have influence over it, then that's a security.

2:31:21.840 --> 2:31:32.080
 If there's a group of engineers that have influence over it, then to a securities lawyer, or to most

2:31:32.080 --> 2:31:35.920
 Bitcoiners and definitely to anybody that's steeped in securities law, you're looking to say,

2:31:35.920 --> 2:31:43.440
 well, that passes the Howey test. It looks like a security. It should be sold to the public pursuant

2:31:43.440 --> 2:31:52.240
 to disclosures and regulations. And you're just ducking the IPO process, right? And so now we get

2:31:52.240 --> 2:31:59.840
 back to the ethical issue. The ethical issue is if you're trading it as a commodity and representing

2:31:59.840 --> 2:32:05.920
 it as a commodity, while truthfully it's a security, then it's a violation of ethics rules,

2:32:05.920 --> 2:32:10.640
 and it's probably illegal. Well, you keep leaning on this. Let me push back on that part. Maybe you

2:32:10.640 --> 2:32:17.440
 hit me, but you keep leaning on this line of securities law as if it would all do respect to

2:32:17.440 --> 2:32:25.520
 lawyers, as if that line somehow defines what is and isn't ethical. I think there's a lot of

2:32:25.520 --> 2:32:32.640
 correlation as you've discussed, but I'd like to leave the line aside. If the law calls something

2:32:32.640 --> 2:32:39.520
 as a security, it doesn't mean in my eyes that it is unethical. I mean, there could be some

2:32:39.520 --> 2:32:44.480
 technicalities and lawyers and people play games with this kind of stuff all the time. But I take

2:32:44.480 --> 2:32:49.520
 your bigger point that if there's a CEO, if there's a project lead, that's fundamentally,

2:32:49.520 --> 2:32:54.560
 well, that to you is fundamentally different than the structure of Bitcoin.

2:32:54.560 --> 2:32:59.200
 It's not that creating securities is unethical. I created security. I took a company public,

2:32:59.840 --> 2:33:04.320
 right? That's not the unethical part. It's completely ethical to create securities.

2:33:04.320 --> 2:33:09.520
 A block is a security. All companies are securities. The unethical part is to

2:33:09.520 --> 2:33:15.760
 represent it as property when it's a security and to promote it or trade it as such.

2:33:16.480 --> 2:33:25.760
 This whole promotion, that's also a technical thing because what counts and not as promotion

2:33:25.760 --> 2:33:31.280
 is a legal thing and you get in trouble for all these things, but that's the game that lawyers

2:33:31.280 --> 2:33:39.120
 play. There's an ethical thing here, which is what's right to promote and not. To me, propaganda is

2:33:39.120 --> 2:33:46.960
 unethical, but it's usually not illegal. If you roll the clock back 20 years,

2:33:48.320 --> 2:33:52.560
 all the boiler room pump and dump schemes were all about someone pitching a penny stock,

2:33:53.200 --> 2:34:00.480
 selling Swampland in Florida. And if you roll the clock back forward 20 years and I create my own

2:34:00.480 --> 2:34:06.880
 company and I represent it as the same thing and I don't make the disclosures, you're just one step

2:34:06.880 --> 2:34:13.840
 removed from the boiler room scheme and that's what's distasteful about it. There are ways to

2:34:13.840 --> 2:34:20.960
 sell securities to the public, but there are expectations. Maybe we could forget about whether

2:34:20.960 --> 2:34:27.200
 the security laws are ethical or not. I will leave that alone. We'll just start with the biblical

2:34:27.200 --> 2:34:33.920
 definition of ethics. Don't lie, cheat, or steal. So if I'm going to sell something to you, I need

2:34:33.920 --> 2:34:42.400
 to fully disclose what I'm selling to you, right? And that's a matter of great debate right now.

2:34:42.400 --> 2:34:47.840
 And so I think that that's part of the debate. But the other part of the debate is

2:34:47.840 --> 2:34:56.560
 whether or not we need more than one token. We need at least one, right? We need at least one

2:34:56.560 --> 2:35:05.440
 digital property because zero means there is no digital economy. And by the way, the conventional

2:35:05.440 --> 2:35:10.240
 view of maximalists is they think there's only one and everything else isn't. That's not the point

2:35:10.240 --> 2:35:16.080
 I'm going to make. I would say we know that there is at least one digital property.

2:35:16.080 --> 2:35:26.080
 And that is Bitcoin. If you can create a truly decentralized, noncustodial, bearer instrument

2:35:26.880 --> 2:35:34.720
 that is not under the control of any organization that is fairly distributed, then you might create

2:35:34.720 --> 2:35:42.080
 another or multiple. And there may be others out there. But I think that

2:35:42.080 --> 2:35:48.960
 the frustration of a lot of people in the Bitcoin community, and I share this with Jack, is we could

2:35:48.960 --> 2:35:55.680
 create $100 trillion of value in the real world simply by building applications on top of Bitcoin

2:35:56.320 --> 2:36:06.080
 as a foundation. And so continually trying to reinvent the wheel and create competitive things

2:36:06.080 --> 2:36:16.800
 is a massive waste of time and it's diversion of human creativity. It's like we have an ethical good

2:36:16.800 --> 2:36:23.680
 thing. And now we're going to try to create a third or a fourth one. Why?

2:36:23.680 --> 2:36:28.800
 Well, let's talk about it. So first of all, I'm with you. But let me ask you this interesting

2:36:28.800 --> 2:36:32.320
 question because we talked about properties and securities, and we talked about how you

2:36:32.320 --> 2:36:43.120
 have a popular Twitter account. It's hilarious and insightful. You do promote Bitcoin, in a sense.

2:36:43.120 --> 2:36:48.160
 I don't know if you would say that. But do you think there's a conflict of interest in anyone

2:36:48.160 --> 2:36:54.320
 who owns Bitcoin promoting Bitcoin? Is it the same as you promoting the first Bitcoin?

2:36:54.320 --> 2:37:07.120
 I would say no, there's an interest. I think that you can promote a property or an idea to the extent

2:37:07.120 --> 2:37:15.120
 that you don't control it. I think that the point at which you start to have a conflict of interest

2:37:15.120 --> 2:37:22.080
 is that you don't control it. I think that the point at which you start to have a conflict of

2:37:22.080 --> 2:37:28.160
 interest is when you're promoting a proprietary product or a proprietary security. A security,

2:37:28.160 --> 2:37:34.320
 in general, is a proprietary asset. So for example, if you look at my Twitter, you will find

2:37:34.320 --> 2:37:39.200
 that I make lots of statements about Bitcoin. You won't ever see me making a statement that,

2:37:39.200 --> 2:37:47.120
 say, MicroStrategy stock will go up forever. I'm not promoting a security MSTR because at the end

2:37:47.120 --> 2:37:54.000
 of the day, MSTR is a security. It is proprietary. I have proprietary interest in it. I have

2:37:54.480 --> 2:37:59.600
 a disproportionate amount of control and influence on the direction.

2:37:59.600 --> 2:38:03.920
 The control is the problem. The control is the problem. Because you have interest in both.

2:38:04.640 --> 2:38:12.880
 If Bitcoin is as successful as we're talking about, you very possibly can become the richest

2:38:12.880 --> 2:38:19.680
 human on earth, given how much you own in Bitcoin, right? The wealthiest, not the richest. I don't

2:38:19.680 --> 2:38:20.800
 know what those words mean.

2:38:20.800 --> 2:38:22.960
 I would benefit economically.

2:38:22.960 --> 2:38:24.720
 You would benefit economically.

2:38:24.720 --> 2:38:25.360
 That's true.

2:38:25.360 --> 2:38:35.280
 So the reason that's not conflict of interest is because the word property, that Bitcoin is an idea

2:38:35.280 --> 2:38:37.600
 and Bitcoin is open.

2:38:37.600 --> 2:38:45.920
 It's because I don't own it. I don't control it. In essence, the ethical line here is,

2:38:45.920 --> 2:38:49.840
 could I print myself 10 million more Bitcoin or not, right?

2:38:51.120 --> 2:38:57.520
 Or can anyone, right? It's not just you. Can anyone? Because can you promote somebody else's?

2:38:57.520 --> 2:39:04.640
 Yes, I guess you can. Like, can you promote Apple when you have no stake?

2:39:04.640 --> 2:39:11.280
 You could have a Twitter account where you promote oil or you promote camping or you promote

2:39:11.280 --> 2:39:16.800
 family values or promote, you know, a carnivore diet or promote the Iron Man, right?

2:39:17.520 --> 2:39:23.280
 You're not going to get wealthier if you promote camping because you can't own a stake. I mean,

2:39:24.880 --> 2:39:30.480
 you own a lot of Bitcoin. What is that? Don't you own the stake in the idea?

2:39:30.480 --> 2:39:33.520
 Yeah, I would grant you that.

2:39:34.720 --> 2:39:40.400
 But the lack of control is the fundamental ethical line that you just, you don't have,

2:39:41.040 --> 2:39:45.360
 all you are is you're a fan of the idea. You believe in the idea and the power of the idea.

2:39:47.760 --> 2:39:49.600
 You can't take that idea away from others.

2:39:50.240 --> 2:39:54.800
 Let's come back to, let me give you some maybe easier examples. If you were the head of the

2:39:54.800 --> 2:40:05.920
 Marine Corps, right? And someone came to you and said, I created MarineCoin. And the twist on

2:40:05.920 --> 2:40:12.560
 MarineCoin is I want you to tell every Marine that they'll get an extra MarineCoin when they

2:40:13.280 --> 2:40:19.360
 get their next stripe. And then I'm going to let you buy MarineCoin now. And then after you buy

2:40:19.360 --> 2:40:29.120
 MarineCoin, I want you to promote it to them, right? At some point, if you start to have a

2:40:29.120 --> 2:40:34.240
 disproportional influence on it, or if you're in a conversation with people with disproportionate

2:40:34.240 --> 2:40:38.880
 influence becomes conflict of interest, and it would make you profoundly uncomfortable, I think,

2:40:39.680 --> 2:40:44.320
 if the head of the Marine Corps started promoting anything that looked like a security.

2:40:44.320 --> 2:40:50.480
 Now, if the head of the Marine Corps started promoting canoeing, you might think he's kind

2:40:50.480 --> 2:40:58.240
 of wacky, like maybe, like that's kind of a waste of time and distraction. So, but to the extent

2:40:58.240 --> 2:41:05.520
 that canoeing is not a security, not a problem, unless you, you know, ultimately, the issue of

2:41:05.520 --> 2:41:11.280
 decentralization is really a critical one. So not having a head. So is it something,

2:41:11.280 --> 2:41:18.960
 can Bitcoin be replicated? So the, all the things that you're saying that make it a property,

2:41:18.960 --> 2:41:20.960
 can that be replicated? Have any other...

2:41:20.960 --> 2:41:24.480
 I think it's possible to create other crypto properties.

2:41:24.480 --> 2:41:32.080
 Does it, does the having a head, like of a project, a thing that limits its ability to be a

2:41:32.080 --> 2:41:38.480
 property, if you try to replicate a project? Is that the fundamental flaw?

2:41:38.480 --> 2:41:45.360
 No, I, look, I think the real fundamental issue is you just never want it to change.

2:41:46.480 --> 2:41:54.000
 Like, like, if you really want something decentralized, you want a genetic template

2:41:54.000 --> 2:42:00.480
 that substantially is not going to change for a thousand years. So I think Satoshi said it at one

2:42:00.480 --> 2:42:06.160
 point, he said the nature of the software is such that by version 0.1, its genetic code was set.

2:42:06.160 --> 2:42:11.280
 If, if there was any development team that's continually changing it, you know, on a routine

2:42:11.280 --> 2:42:18.240
 basis, it becomes harder and harder to maintain its decentralization because now, now there's the

2:42:18.240 --> 2:42:28.400
 issue of who's influencing the changes. So what you really want is, is a very, very simple idea,

2:42:28.400 --> 2:42:33.680
 right? The simplest idea, I'm just going to keep track of who owns 21 million parts of energy.

2:42:33.680 --> 2:42:40.160
 And when someone proposes big functional upgrades, you almost don't, you don't really want that

2:42:40.160 --> 2:42:44.560
 development to go on the base layer. You want that development to go on the layer threes, because

2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:50.640
 now, cache app has a proprietary set of functionality and it's a security.

2:42:51.440 --> 2:42:56.400
 And if you're going to promote the use of this thing, you're not going to, you're not going to

2:42:56.400 --> 2:43:04.080
 promote the layer three security because that's a, an edge to a given entity and you're trusting

2:43:04.080 --> 2:43:09.440
 the counterparty, you're going to promote the layer one or at most the layer two.

2:43:09.440 --> 2:43:18.640
 Okay. So one of the fascinating things about Bitcoin, and sorry to romanticize certain notions,

2:43:18.640 --> 2:43:24.640
 but Satoshi Nakamoto, that the founder is anonymous. Maybe you can speak a little bit

2:43:24.640 --> 2:43:31.680
 about that. Maybe you can speak to whether that's useful, but also I just like the psychology of

2:43:31.680 --> 2:43:36.080
 that to imagine that there's a human being that was able to create something special and walk away.

2:43:37.040 --> 2:43:39.600
 So first are you Satoshi Nakamoto?

2:43:40.240 --> 2:43:49.200
 I'm certain I'm not. No, actually I, you know, I think the providence is really important. And

2:43:49.200 --> 2:43:55.200
 if I were to look at the highlighted points, I think having a founder that was anonymous

2:43:55.200 --> 2:44:00.320
 or should anonymous is important. I think the founder disappearing is also important. I think

2:44:00.320 --> 2:44:07.600
 that the fact that the Satoshi coins never moved is also important. I think the lack of an initial

2:44:07.600 --> 2:44:14.720
 coin offering is also important. I think the lack of a corporate sponsor is important. I think the

2:44:14.720 --> 2:44:22.880
 fact that it traded for 15 months with no commercial value was also important. I think that

2:44:24.720 --> 2:44:31.840
 the simplicity of the protocol is very important. I think that the outcome of the block size wars

2:44:31.840 --> 2:44:40.800
 is very important. And all of those things add up to common property. They're all indicia,

2:44:40.800 --> 2:44:47.360
 indicators of a digital property as opposed to security. If there was a Satoshi sitting around,

2:44:47.360 --> 2:44:53.360
 sitting on top of $50 billion worth of Bitcoin, I don't think it would

2:44:55.200 --> 2:45:02.080
 cripple Bitcoin as property, but I think it would undermine its digital property.

2:45:02.080 --> 2:45:07.040
 And if I wanted to undermine a crypto asset network, I would do the opposite of all those

2:45:07.040 --> 2:45:14.560
 things. I would launch one myself, I would sell 25% or 50% of the general public, I would keep some

2:45:14.560 --> 2:45:19.040
 of the initial, I would pre mine some stuff or early mine it, you know, and I would keep an

2:45:19.040 --> 2:45:27.680
 influence on it. Those are all the opposite of what you would do in order to create common property.

2:45:28.400 --> 2:45:36.160
 And so I see the entire story as Satoshi giving a gift of digital property to the human race

2:45:36.160 --> 2:45:37.440
 and disappearing.

2:45:37.440 --> 2:45:41.040
 Do you think it was one person? Do you have ideas of who it could be?

2:45:41.040 --> 2:45:43.680
 I don't care to speculate.

2:45:44.960 --> 2:45:46.240
 But do you think it was one person?

2:45:47.040 --> 2:45:51.920
 It was one person, maybe in conjunction with a bunch of others. I mean, it might have been a

2:45:51.920 --> 2:45:55.520
 group of people that were working together, but certainly there's a Satoshi.

2:45:55.520 --> 2:46:01.520
 I mean, it's just so fascinating to me that one person could be so brave and thoughtful. Or do you

2:46:01.520 --> 2:46:06.640
 think a lot of his accent, like the block size wars, the decision to make a block a certain size,

2:46:07.600 --> 2:46:12.880
 all the things you mentioned led up to the characteristics that make Bitcoin property.

2:46:14.080 --> 2:46:19.680
 Do you think that's an accident? Or it was deeply thought through? Like how does this is almost like

2:46:19.680 --> 2:46:21.040
 a history of science question.

2:46:21.040 --> 2:46:26.160
 They tried 40 of them, right? I mean, I think there's a there's a history of attempting to

2:46:26.160 --> 2:46:30.960
 create something like this. And it was tried many, many times and, and they failed for different

2:46:30.960 --> 2:46:36.960
 reasons. And I think that it's like Prometheus tried to start a fire 47 times and maybe the 48th

2:46:36.960 --> 2:46:44.720
 time it sparked. And that's how I see this. This is the first one that sparked. And it sets a

2:46:44.720 --> 2:46:51.760
 roadmap for us. And I think if you're looking for any one word that characterizes it, it's fair.

2:46:51.760 --> 2:46:59.840
 The whole point of the network is it's a fair launch, a fair distribution. Like, yeah, I have

2:46:59.840 --> 2:47:08.560
 Bitcoin, but I bought it. In fact, I, you know, at this point, we've paid $4 billion of you real

2:47:08.560 --> 2:47:16.240
 cash to buy it. If I was sitting on the same position, and I had it for free, then there's

2:47:16.240 --> 2:47:21.520
 always this question of, did I, you know, or I bought it for a nickel, a coin or a penny, a coin.

2:47:21.520 --> 2:47:28.160
 The question is, was it fair? And that's a very hard question to answer, right? Did you acquire

2:47:28.160 --> 2:47:34.880
 the Bitcoin that you own fairly? And if you roll the clock back, you know, you could have bought it

2:47:34.880 --> 2:47:40.880
 for a nickel or a dime, but that was when it was a million times more likely to fail, right? When

2:47:40.880 --> 2:47:47.920
 the risk was greater, the cost was lower. And then over time, the risk became lower and the cost

2:47:47.920 --> 2:47:55.920
 became greater. And the real critical thing was to allow the marketplace, absent any powerful

2:47:55.920 --> 2:48:01.440
 interested actor, right? It's almost like if Satoshi had held a million coins and then stayed

2:48:01.440 --> 2:48:07.040
 engaged for 10 more years, tweaking things in the background, there'd still be that question.

2:48:08.080 --> 2:48:14.960
 But what we've got is really a beautiful thing. We've got a chain reaction in cyberspace or an

2:48:14.960 --> 2:48:26.880
 ideology spreading virally in the world that has seasoned in a fair ethical fashion. Sometimes it's

2:48:26.880 --> 2:48:32.240
 a very violent, brutal fashion with all the volatility, right? And there's been a lot of,

2:48:32.240 --> 2:48:34.960
 you know, a lot of sound and fury along the way.

2:48:34.960 --> 2:48:41.360
 How do you psychoanalyze? How do you deal from a financial, from a human perspective with the

2:48:41.360 --> 2:48:46.880
 volatility? You mentioned you could have gotten it for a nickel and the risk was great. Where's the

2:48:46.880 --> 2:48:48.720
 risk today? What's your sense?

2:48:48.720 --> 2:48:54.640
 You know, we're 13 years into this entire activity. I think the risk has never been lower.

2:48:56.240 --> 2:49:03.600
 If you look at all the risks, right, the risks in the early years are, is the engineering protocol

2:49:03.600 --> 2:49:12.560
 proper? Like one megabyte block size, 10 minute clock frequency cryptography is first, will it be

2:49:12.560 --> 2:49:19.360
 hacked or will it crash? 730,000 blocks and it hasn't crashed. Will it be hacked? Hasn't been

2:49:19.360 --> 2:49:23.600
 hacked. But you know, it's a Lindy thing, right? You wait 13 years to see if it'll be hacked.

2:49:23.600 --> 2:49:28.960
 But on the other hand, with a billion dollars, it's not as interesting a target as it is with

2:49:28.960 --> 2:49:35.600
 a hundred billion. And when it gets to be worth a trillion, then it's a bigger target. So the

2:49:35.600 --> 2:49:43.840
 risk has been bleeding off over time as the network monetized. I think the second question is,

2:49:43.840 --> 2:49:49.440
 will it be banned? You couldn't know. It literally could have been banned at any time, many times

2:49:49.440 --> 2:49:54.880
 early on. In fact, in 2013, I tweeted on that subject. I thought it would be banned. I made a

2:49:54.880 --> 2:50:03.760
 very infamous tweet. I thought it was going to be banned. In 2014, the IRS designated it as

2:50:03.760 --> 2:50:09.680
 property and gave it property tax treatment, okay? So they could have given it a tax treatment where

2:50:09.680 --> 2:50:15.360
 you had to pay tax on the unrealized capital gains every year and it probably would have

2:50:15.360 --> 2:50:25.040
 crushed it to death, right? So it could have been in any number of places banned by a government.

2:50:25.040 --> 2:50:29.920
 But in fact, it was legitimized as property. And then the question is, would it be hacked

2:50:29.920 --> 2:50:34.640
 or would it be copied? Well, it'd be something better than that. And it was copied 15,000 times.

2:50:34.640 --> 2:50:41.040
 And you know the story of all those. And they either diverged to be something totally different

2:50:41.040 --> 2:50:48.000
 and not comparable or someone trying to copy a non sovereign bearer instrument store of value

2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:56.240
 found that their networks crashed to be 1% of what Bitcoin is. So now we're sitting at a point where

2:50:56.240 --> 2:51:01.760
 all those risks are out of the way. I would say that year one of institutional adoption

2:51:02.560 --> 2:51:08.800
 is it started August 2020. That's when MicroStrategy bought $250 million worth of

2:51:08.800 --> 2:51:13.760
 Bitcoin and we put that on the wire. We were the first publicly traded company to actually buy

2:51:15.120 --> 2:51:18.720
 Bitcoin. I don't think you could have found a $5 million purchase from a public company

2:51:18.720 --> 2:51:25.200
 before we did that. So that was kind of like a gun going off. And then in the next 12 months,

2:51:26.400 --> 2:51:32.720
 Tesla bought Bitcoin, Square bought Bitcoin. And I'd say now we're in year two of institutional

2:51:32.720 --> 2:51:38.640
 adoption. And there are about 24, should be 24 publicly traded Bitcoin miners by the end of this

2:51:38.640 --> 2:51:48.800
 quarter. So you're looking at 36 publicly traded companies. And you've got 50, at least in the

2:51:48.800 --> 2:51:55.600
 range of $50 billion of Bitcoin on the balance sheet of publicly traded companies and hundreds

2:51:55.600 --> 2:52:03.600
 of billions of dollars of market cap of Bitcoin exposed companies. So I would say the asset,

2:52:04.720 --> 2:52:14.000
 decade one was entrepreneurial, experimental. Decade two is a rotation from entrepreneurs

2:52:14.000 --> 2:52:19.280
 institutions and is becoming institutionalized. So maybe decade one, you go from zero to a trillion

2:52:19.280 --> 2:52:22.080
 and a decade two, you go from one trillion to a hundred trillion.

2:52:22.080 --> 2:52:25.600
 Trey Lockerbie What about governments, government adoption,

2:52:25.600 --> 2:52:31.440
 institutional adoption? Are governments important in this? Maybe making it some governments

2:52:32.160 --> 2:52:39.120
 incorporating it into as a currency into their banks, all that kind of stuff. Is that important?

2:52:39.120 --> 2:52:41.680
 And if it is, when will it happen?

2:52:41.680 --> 2:52:45.360
 John Ligato It's not essential for the success of the asset

2:52:45.360 --> 2:52:52.560
 class, but I think it's inevitable in various degrees over time. But the most likely thing

2:52:52.560 --> 2:53:02.800
 to happen next is large acquisitions by institutional investors of Bitcoin as a digital

2:53:02.800 --> 2:53:08.000
 gold, where they're just swapping out gold for digital gold and thinking of it like that.

2:53:08.560 --> 2:53:12.160
 And the government entities most likely to be involved with that would be sovereign wealth

2:53:12.160 --> 2:53:18.160
 funds. If you look at all the sovereign wealth funds that are holding big tech stock, equities,

2:53:18.160 --> 2:53:24.800
 the Swiss, the Norwegians, the Middle Easterners, if you can hold big tech, then holding digital

2:53:24.800 --> 2:53:32.240
 gold would be not far removed from that. That's a noncontroversial adoption.

2:53:33.440 --> 2:53:40.320
 I think there are opportunities for governments that are much more profound. If a government

2:53:40.320 --> 2:53:48.880
 started to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, that's much bigger than just an asset

2:53:48.880 --> 2:53:56.640
 investment. That's 100x bigger. And you could imagine that's like a trillion dollar opportunity.

2:53:56.640 --> 2:54:01.040
 Like any government that wanted to adopt it as a treasury reserve asset would probably

2:54:01.040 --> 2:54:08.560
 generate trillions of dollars, a trillion or more of value. And then the thing that people

2:54:08.560 --> 2:54:14.640
 think about is, well, will oil ever be priced in Bitcoin or any other export commodity?

2:54:15.680 --> 2:54:21.840
 I think there's like $1.8 trillion or more of export commodities in the world. And right now,

2:54:21.840 --> 2:54:27.520
 they're all priced in dollars. I think that this is a colorful thing, but not really that relevant.

2:54:27.520 --> 2:54:33.360
 Like you could sell all that stuff in dollars. The relevant decision that any institution makes,

2:54:33.360 --> 2:54:38.720
 whether they're a nonprofit, a university, a corporation, or a government, is what's your

2:54:38.720 --> 2:54:44.960
 treasury reserve asset? And if your treasury reserve asset is the peso, and if the peso is

2:54:45.760 --> 2:54:56.160
 losing 20% or 30% of its value a year, then your balance sheet is collapsing within five years.

2:54:56.160 --> 2:55:03.120
 And if the treasury reserve asset is dollars and currency derivatives and US treasuries,

2:55:04.080 --> 2:55:12.000
 then you're getting your seven. Right now, it's probably 15% or more monetary inflation. We're

2:55:12.000 --> 2:55:16.640
 running double the historic average. You could argue triple, somewhere between double and triple,

2:55:16.640 --> 2:55:23.360
 depending upon what your metric is. So do I think it'll happen? I think that they're conservative,

2:55:23.360 --> 2:55:30.560
 but they have to be shocked. And I think there is a shock. The late Russian sanctions are a big

2:55:30.560 --> 2:55:36.560
 shock. When the West sees $300 billion worth of Russian gold and currency derivatives, I think

2:55:37.440 --> 2:55:45.520
 you got the famous quote by Putin that we have to rethink our treasury strategies. And that pushes

2:55:45.520 --> 2:55:50.880
 everybody toward a commodity strategy. What commodities do I want to hold? I think that's

2:55:50.880 --> 2:55:54.720
 got a lot of people thinking. I think it's got the Chinese thinking. Everybody wants to be the

2:55:54.720 --> 2:56:03.280
 reserve currency, right? So if I buy $50 billion worth of dollars every year, then I buy $500

2:56:03.280 --> 2:56:15.280
 billion over a decade, and I probably pay $250 billion of inflation cost on the backs of my

2:56:15.280 --> 2:56:22.320
 on the backs of my citizens in a decade. So inflation could be one of the sources of shock.

2:56:23.040 --> 2:56:29.840
 And you wonder if there is a switch to Bitcoin, whether it will be a bang or a whimper. Like,

2:56:29.840 --> 2:56:37.040
 what is the nature of the shock or the transition? I think that the year 2022 is pretty catalytic

2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:43.840
 for digital assets in general and for Bitcoin in particular. The Canadian trucker crisis,

2:56:43.840 --> 2:56:50.480
 I think, educated hundreds of millions of people and made them start questioning their property

2:56:50.480 --> 2:56:59.760
 rights and their banks. I think the Ukraine war was a second shock. But I think that the Russian

2:56:59.760 --> 2:57:08.160
 sanctions was a third shock. Yeah, I think all three of them. And I think hyperinflation in the

2:57:08.160 --> 2:57:12.720
 rest of the world is a fourth shock. And then persistent inflation in the US is a fifth shock.

2:57:12.720 --> 2:57:19.840
 So I think it's a perfect storm. And if you put all these events together, what do they signify?

2:57:19.840 --> 2:57:27.120
 They signify the rational conclusion for any person thinking about this is, I'm not sure if I

2:57:27.120 --> 2:57:32.720
 can trust my property. I don't know if I have property rights. I don't know if I can trust the

2:57:32.720 --> 2:57:40.880
 bank. And if I'm politically at odds with the leader of my own country, I'm going to lose my

2:57:40.880 --> 2:57:47.040
 property. And if I'm politically at odds with the owner of another country, I'm still going to lose

2:57:47.040 --> 2:57:53.840
 my property. And when push comes to shove, the banks will freeze my assets and seize them.

2:57:54.640 --> 2:58:05.280
 And I think that that is playing out in front of everybody in the world, such that your logical

2:58:05.280 --> 2:58:13.520
 response would be, I'm going to convert my weak currency to a strong currency. Like I'll convert

2:58:13.520 --> 2:58:20.160
 my peso and lira to the dollar. I'm going to convert my weak property to strong property.

2:58:20.640 --> 2:58:29.040
 I'm going to sell my building downtown Moscow. And I'd rather own a building in New York City. I'd

2:58:29.040 --> 2:58:36.560
 rather own in a powerful nation than be stuck with a building in Nigeria or a building in Argentina

2:58:36.560 --> 2:58:41.520
 or whatever. So I'm going to sell my weak properties to buy strong properties. I'm going to

2:58:41.520 --> 2:58:47.440
 convert my physical assets to digital assets. I'd rather own a digital building than own a physical

2:58:47.440 --> 2:58:53.440
 building. Because if I had a billion dollar building in Moscow, who can I rent that to?

2:58:53.440 --> 2:58:58.240
 But if I have a billion dollar digital building, I can rent it to anybody in any city in the world,

2:58:59.040 --> 2:59:05.040
 anybody with money. And the maintenance cost is almost nothing. And I can hold it for 100 years.

2:59:05.040 --> 2:59:11.280
 So it's an indestructible building. And then finally, I want to move from having my assets

2:59:11.280 --> 2:59:19.360
 in a bank with a counterparty to self custody assets. And this is not just Ukraine, but this is

2:59:19.360 --> 2:59:26.480
 like the story in Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, South America. You don't

2:59:26.480 --> 2:59:32.320
 really want to be sitting with $10 million in a bank in Istanbul, the bank's going to freeze your

2:59:32.320 --> 2:59:39.440
 money converted to lira, devalue the lira and then feed it back to you over 17 years, right?

2:59:39.440 --> 2:59:42.720
 So self custody assets will be layer one Bitcoin.

2:59:42.720 --> 2:59:49.120
 Self custody assets, it's like, if I if I got my own hardware wallet, and I've either got

2:59:50.800 --> 2:59:56.560
 your highest form of self custody would be Bitcoin on your own hardware wallet or Bitcoin

2:59:56.560 --> 3:00:01.600
 and your own self custody. And the other the other thing people think about is how do I get crypto

3:00:01.600 --> 3:00:08.560
 dollars like tether, like some stable coin? Yeah, like I'd rather if you had a choice, would you

3:00:08.560 --> 3:00:15.200
 rather have your money in a bank in a warzone in dollars or have your money in a stable coin on

3:00:15.200 --> 3:00:22.400
 your mobile phone in dollars? Right? I mean, you take the latter risk rather than the former

3:00:22.400 --> 3:00:27.200
 warzone. Definitely. Yeah. And you can see that happening. Like we've gone from 5 billion in

3:00:27.200 --> 3:00:34.480
 stable coins to 200 billion. Yeah. In the last 24 months. Yeah. So I do think there's massive demand

3:00:34.480 --> 3:00:42.800
 for crypto dollars in the form of a US dollar asset. And there's and everybody in the world

3:00:42.800 --> 3:00:48.960
 would say, Yeah, I want that. Well, unless you're just an extreme patriot, but most people in the

3:00:48.960 --> 3:00:53.520
 world would say I want that. And then a lesser group of people would say, I think I want to be

3:00:53.520 --> 3:01:00.000
 able to carry my property in the palm of my hand. So I have self custody of it. So the

3:01:00.000 --> 3:01:05.120
 Bitcoin price has gone through quite a roller coaster. What do you think is the high point

3:01:05.120 --> 3:01:12.800
 is going to hit? I think it'll go forever. Right? I mean, I think the Bitcoin is going to,

3:01:12.800 --> 3:01:18.560
 it's going to climb in a serpentine fashion, it's going to advance and come back and it's going to

3:01:18.560 --> 3:01:25.360
 keep, it's going to keep climbing. I think that the volatility attracts all the capital

3:01:25.360 --> 3:01:31.040
 into the marketplace. And so the volatility makes it the most interesting thing in the financial

3:01:31.040 --> 3:01:38.240
 universe. It also generates massive yield and massive returns for traders. And that attracts

3:01:38.240 --> 3:01:46.800
 capital. Like we're talking about the difference between 5% return and 500% return. So the fast

3:01:46.800 --> 3:01:53.120
 money is attracted by the volatility. The volatility has been decreasing year by year by

3:01:53.120 --> 3:02:00.080
 year. I think that it's stabilizing. I don't think we'll see as much volatility in the future as we

3:02:00.080 --> 3:02:10.480
 have in the past. I think that if we look at Bitcoin and model it as digital gold, the market

3:02:10.480 --> 3:02:18.880
 cap goes to between 10 and 20 trillion. But gold is, remember, gold is defective property. Gold is

3:02:18.880 --> 3:02:23.760
 dead money. You have a billion dollars of gold that sits in a vault for a decade. It's very hard

3:02:23.760 --> 3:02:28.960
 to mortgage the gold. It's also very hard to rent the gold. You can't loan the gold. No one's going

3:02:28.960 --> 3:02:35.120
 to create a business with your gold. So gold doesn't generate much of a yield. So for that

3:02:35.120 --> 3:02:42.560
 reason, most people wouldn't store a billion dollars for a decade in gold. They would buy a

3:02:42.560 --> 3:02:48.960
 billion dollars of commercial real estate property. And the reason why is because I can rent it and

3:02:48.960 --> 3:02:54.320
 generate a yield on it that's in excess of the maintenance cost. So if you consider digital

3:02:54.320 --> 3:03:04.000
 property, that's 100 to 200 trillion dollar addressable market. So I would think it goes from

3:03:04.000 --> 3:03:08.160
 10 trillion to 100 trillion as people start to think of it as digital property.

3:03:08.160 --> 3:03:11.680
 What does that mean in terms of price per coin?

3:03:11.680 --> 3:03:20.800
 At 500,000, that's a 10 trillion dollar asset. At 5 million, that's a 100 trillion dollar asset.

3:03:20.800 --> 3:03:23.520
 So I think it crosses a million. It can go even higher.

3:03:24.240 --> 3:03:27.680
 Yeah, I think it keeps going up forever. I mean, there's no reason it couldn't go to 10 million

3:03:27.680 --> 3:03:34.080
 a coin, right? Because digital property isn't the highest form, right? Gold was that low frequency

3:03:34.080 --> 3:03:43.600
 money. Property is a mid frequency money. But when I start to program it faster, it starts to

3:03:43.600 --> 3:03:52.000
 look like digital energy. And then it doesn't just replace property, then you're starting to replace

3:03:52.000 --> 3:03:59.120
 bonds. It's 100 trillion in bonds, there's 50 to 100 trillion in other currency derivatives.

3:04:00.960 --> 3:04:09.840
 And these are all conventional use cases, right? I think that there's 350 trillion to 500 trillion

3:04:09.840 --> 3:04:16.960
 dollars worth of currency derivatives in the world. And when I say that, I mean things that

3:04:16.960 --> 3:04:23.040
 are valued based upon fiat cash flows, any commercial real estate, any bond, any sovereign

3:04:23.040 --> 3:04:30.640
 debt, any currency itself, any derivatives to those things, they're all derivatives,

3:04:30.640 --> 3:04:35.840
 and they're all defective. And they're all defective because of this persistent 7% to 14%

3:04:37.760 --> 3:04:41.760
 lapse, which we call inflation or monetary expansion.

3:04:41.760 --> 3:04:48.000
 Can we switch subjects to talk about the energy side of it, like the innovative piece?

3:04:48.000 --> 3:04:48.320
 Yeah.

3:04:48.320 --> 3:04:53.920
 Let's just start with this idea that I've got a hotel worth a billion dollars with a thousand

3:04:53.920 --> 3:04:56.880
 rooms. When it becomes a dematerialized hotel.

3:04:57.920 --> 3:05:00.880
 I love that word so much, by the way, dematerialized hotel.

3:05:00.880 --> 3:05:04.320
 We're crossing the fountain blow here. Imagine the fountain blow is dematerialized.

3:05:05.200 --> 3:05:09.920
 The problem with a physical hotel is it got to hire real people moving subject to the speed of

3:05:09.920 --> 3:05:15.360
 sound and physics laws and Newton's laws, and I can rent it to people in Miami Beach.

3:05:16.320 --> 3:05:21.680
 But if it was a digital hotel, I could rent the room to people in Paris, London, and New York

3:05:21.680 --> 3:05:28.240
 every night, and I can run it with robots. And as soon as I do that, I can rent it by the room hour,

3:05:28.240 --> 3:05:33.840
 and I can rent it by the room minute. And so I start to chop my hotel up into

3:05:33.840 --> 3:05:40.160
 a hundred thousand room hours that I sell to the highest bidder anywhere in the world.

3:05:40.800 --> 3:05:46.880
 And you can see all of a sudden the yield, the rent, and the income of the property

3:05:47.920 --> 3:05:54.080
 is dramatically increased. I can also see the maintenance cost of the property falls.

3:05:54.640 --> 3:05:59.920
 I get on Moore's Law, and I'm operating in cyberspace. So I got rid of Newton's

3:05:59.920 --> 3:06:06.960
 laws. I got rid of all the friction and all those problems. I tapped into the benefits of cyberspace.

3:06:07.680 --> 3:06:14.880
 I created a global property. I started monetizing at different frequencies. And of course, now I can

3:06:14.880 --> 3:06:21.200
 mortgage it to anybody in the world. You're not going to be able to get a mortgage on a Turkish

3:06:21.200 --> 3:06:28.320
 building from someone in South Africa. You have to find someone that's local to the culture you're in.

3:06:28.320 --> 3:06:34.960
 So when you start to move from analog property to digital property, it's not just a little bit

3:06:34.960 --> 3:06:41.520
 better. It's a lot better. And what I just described, Lex, is like the DeFi vision, right?

3:06:41.520 --> 3:06:48.800
 It's the beauty of DeFi, flash loans, money moving at high velocity. At some point,

3:06:48.800 --> 3:06:57.040
 if the hotel is dematerialized, then what's the difference between renting a hotel room

3:06:57.040 --> 3:07:02.320
 and loaning a block of stock, right? I'm just finding the highest best use of the thing.

3:07:03.120 --> 3:07:10.240
 It feels like the magic really emerges, though, when you build a market of layer two and layer

3:07:10.240 --> 3:07:16.560
 three technologies on top of that. It's like, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, but for

3:07:16.560 --> 3:07:22.960
 all these hotels and all these kinds of ideas, it's always touching humans at some point. And

3:07:25.280 --> 3:07:31.120
 consumers or humans, business owners, and so on. So you have to create interface, you have to create

3:07:31.120 --> 3:07:38.000
 services that make all that super efficient, super fun to use, pleasant, effective, all those kinds

3:07:38.000 --> 3:07:42.480
 of things. So you have to build a whole economy on top of that. Yeah, and I happen to think that won't

3:07:42.480 --> 3:07:48.000
 be done by the crypto industry at all. I think that'll be done by centralized applications.

3:07:48.800 --> 3:07:54.720
 I think it'll be the citadels of the world, the high speed traders of the world, the New Yorkers.

3:07:55.520 --> 3:08:03.920
 I think it'll be Binance, FTX, and Coinbase as a layer three exchange that will give you the yield

3:08:03.920 --> 3:08:10.000
 and will give you the loan and the best terms. Because ultimately, you have to jump these

3:08:10.000 --> 3:08:16.720
 compliance hoops. It comes like BlockFi can give you yield, but they have to do it in a compliant

3:08:16.720 --> 3:08:23.280
 way with the United States jurisdiction. So ultimately, those applications to use that digital

3:08:23.280 --> 3:08:29.920
 property and either generate a loan, give you a loan on it or give you yield on it are going to

3:08:29.920 --> 3:08:37.520
 come from companies. But the difference, the fundamental difference is it could be companies

3:08:37.520 --> 3:08:43.120
 anywhere in the world. So if a company in Singapore comes up with a better offering,

3:08:44.640 --> 3:08:50.560
 right, then the capital is going to start to flow to Singapore. I can't send 10 city blocks of

3:08:50.560 --> 3:08:58.640
 LA to Singapore to rent during a festival, but I can send 10 blocks of Bitcoin to Singapore.

3:08:59.280 --> 3:09:05.360
 So you've got a truly global market that's functioning in this asset. And is there second

3:09:05.360 --> 3:09:10.560
 order asset? For example, maybe you're an American citizen and you own 10 Bitcoin and someone in

3:09:10.560 --> 3:09:16.720
 Singapore will generate 27% yield in the Bitcoin. But legally, you can't send the money to them or

3:09:16.720 --> 3:09:22.000
 the Bitcoin to them. It doesn't matter because the fact that that exists means that someone in Hong

3:09:22.000 --> 3:09:28.880
 Kong will borrow the 10 Bitcoin from somebody in New York, and then they will put on the trade

3:09:28.880 --> 3:09:33.680
 in Singapore. And that will create a demand for Bitcoin, which will drive up the market.

3:09:33.680 --> 3:09:38.320
 A demand for Bitcoin, which will drive up the price of Bitcoin, which will result in an effective

3:09:38.960 --> 3:09:43.040
 tax free yield for the person in the US that's not even in the jurisdiction.

3:09:43.760 --> 3:09:49.280
 So there's nothing that's going on in Singapore to drive up the price of your land in LA.

3:09:50.160 --> 3:09:54.720
 But there is something going on everywhere in the world to drive up the price of

3:09:54.720 --> 3:10:02.000
 property and cyberspace if there's only one digital Manhattan. And so there's a dynamic

3:10:02.000 --> 3:10:07.760
 there which is profound because it's global. But now let's go to the next extreme. I'm still

3:10:07.760 --> 3:10:15.440
 giving you a fairly conventional idea, which is let's just loan the money fast on a global network

3:10:15.440 --> 3:10:23.280
 and let's just rent the hotel room fast in cyberspace. But let's move to maybe a more

3:10:23.280 --> 3:10:29.360
 innovative idea. The first generation of internet brought a lot of productivity, but there's also

3:10:29.360 --> 3:10:36.480
 just a lot of flaws in it. For example, Twitter is full of garbage. Instagram DMs are full of

3:10:36.480 --> 3:10:42.880
 garbage. Your Twitter DMs are full of garbage. YouTube is full of scams. Every 15 minutes,

3:10:42.880 --> 3:10:49.840
 there's a Michael Saylor Bitcoin giveaway spun up on YouTube. My Office 365 inbox is full of garbage,

3:10:50.720 --> 3:10:57.520
 millions of spam messages. I'm running four different email filters. My company spends

3:10:57.520 --> 3:11:01.120
 million dollars a year to fight denial of service attacks and all sorts of other

3:11:01.840 --> 3:11:07.920
 security things. There are denial of service attacks everywhere against everybody in cyberspace

3:11:07.920 --> 3:11:14.000
 all the time. It's extreme. And we're all beset with hostility. You've been a victim of it in

3:11:14.000 --> 3:11:20.560
 Twitter. You go on Twitter and people post stuff they would never say to your face. And then if you

3:11:20.560 --> 3:11:26.000
 look, you find out that the account was created like three days ago and it's not even a real

3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:33.040
 person. So, you know, we're beset with phishing attacks and scams and spam bots and garbage.

3:11:33.600 --> 3:11:38.880
 And why? And the answer is because the first generation of internet was digital information

3:11:38.880 --> 3:11:45.120
 and there's no energy. There's no conservation of energy in cyberspace. The thing that makes

3:11:45.120 --> 3:11:53.200
 the universe work is conservation of energy. Like if I went to a hotel room, I'd have to post a

3:11:53.200 --> 3:12:00.160
 credit card. And then if I smashed the place up, there'd be economic consequences. Maybe there'd

3:12:00.160 --> 3:12:06.160
 be criminal consequences. There might be reputational consequences. You know, a lamp

3:12:06.160 --> 3:12:12.800
 might fall on me. But in the worst case, I can only smash up one hotel room. Now, imagine I could

3:12:12.800 --> 3:12:18.560
 actually write a Python script to send myself to every hotel room in the world every minute,

3:12:18.560 --> 3:12:26.560
 not post a credit card and smash them all up anonymously. The thing that makes the universe

3:12:26.560 --> 3:12:34.480
 work is friction, speed of sound, speed of light, and the fact that it's ultimately it's conservative.

3:12:34.480 --> 3:12:39.760
 You're either energy or your matter, but once you've used the energy, it's gone and you can't

3:12:39.760 --> 3:12:47.600
 do infinite everything. That's missing in cyberspace right now. And if you look at all of

3:12:47.600 --> 3:12:55.360
 the moral hazards and all of the product defects that we have in all of these products, most of

3:12:55.360 --> 3:13:04.720
 them, 99% of them could be cured if we introduced conservation of energy into cyberspace. And

3:13:04.720 --> 3:13:10.320
 that's what you can do with high speed digital property, high speed Bitcoin. And by high speed,

3:13:10.320 --> 3:13:18.320
 I mean, not 20 transactions a day, I mean, 20,000 transactions a day. So how do you do that? Well,

3:13:20.320 --> 3:13:28.320
 I let everybody on Twitter post 1000 or 10,000 Satoshis via lightning wallet, a lightning badge,

3:13:28.320 --> 3:13:35.200
 give me an orange check. If you put up 20 bucks once in your life, you could give 300 million

3:13:35.200 --> 3:13:42.560
 people an orange check. Right now, you don't have a blue check, Lex. You're a famous person. I don't

3:13:42.560 --> 3:13:48.320
 know why you don't have a blue check. Have you ever applied for a blue check? No. There are 360,000

3:13:48.320 --> 3:13:55.360
 people on Twitter with a blue check. There are 300 million people on Twitter. So the conventional

3:13:55.360 --> 3:14:03.920
 way to verify accounts is elitist archaic. Yeah, how does it work? How do you get a blue check?

3:14:03.920 --> 3:14:11.200
 You go to apply and wait six months and you have to post like three articles in the public

3:14:11.200 --> 3:14:17.520
 mainstream media that illustrates you're a person of interest. Generally, they would grant them to

3:14:17.520 --> 3:14:25.760
 CEOs of public companies. The whole idea is to verify that you are who you say you are.

3:14:26.320 --> 3:14:31.760
 But the question is, why isn't everybody verified? And there's a couple of threads on that. One is

3:14:31.760 --> 3:14:37.920
 some people don't want to be doxxed. They want to be anonymous. But there are even anonymous people

3:14:37.920 --> 3:14:45.440
 that should be verified. Because otherwise, you're subjecting their entire following to

3:14:45.440 --> 3:14:52.720
 phishing attacks and scams and hostility. But the other... What's the orange verification? So

3:14:53.600 --> 3:14:58.000
 this idea, can you actually elaborate a little bit more if you put up 20 bucks? Yeah, I think

3:14:58.000 --> 3:15:01.840
 everybody on Twitter ought to be able to get an orange check if they could come up with like $10.

3:15:02.640 --> 3:15:09.520
 And what is the power of that orange check? What does that verify exactly? You basically post a

3:15:09.520 --> 3:15:16.400
 security deposit for your safe passes through cyberspace. So the way it would work is if you've

3:15:16.400 --> 3:15:23.440
 got $10 once in your life, you can basically show that you're credit worthy. And that's your pledge

3:15:23.440 --> 3:15:31.120
 to me that you're going to act responsibly. So you put the 10 or the $20 into the lightning wallet,

3:15:31.120 --> 3:15:36.720
 you get an orange check. Then Twitter just gives you a setting where I can say the only people that

3:15:36.720 --> 3:15:40.480
 could DM me are orange checks. The only people that can post on my tweets are orange checks.

3:15:41.120 --> 3:15:47.600
 So instead of locking out the public and just letting your followers comment, you lock out

3:15:47.600 --> 3:15:52.960
 all the unverified. And that means people that don't want to post $10 security deposit can't

3:15:52.960 --> 3:16:00.240
 comment. Once you've done those two things, then you're in position to monetize malice,

3:16:01.520 --> 3:16:06.080
 monetize motion or malice for that matter. But let's just say for the sake of argument,

3:16:06.080 --> 3:16:15.680
 you post something and 9,700 bots spin up and pitch their whatever scam. Right now,

3:16:15.680 --> 3:16:21.280
 you sit and you go report, report, report, report, report, report. And if you spend an hour,

3:16:21.280 --> 3:16:26.640
 you get through half of them, you waste an hour of your life. They just spin up another 97

3:16:26.640 --> 3:16:30.880
 gazillion because they've got a Python script spinning it up, so it's hopeless. But on the

3:16:30.880 --> 3:16:36.880
 other hand, if you report them, and they really are a bot, Twitter's got a method to actually

3:16:37.920 --> 3:16:42.320
 delete the account. They know that they're bots. The problem is not they don't know how to delete

3:16:42.320 --> 3:16:45.520
 the account. The problem is there are no consequences when they delete the account.

3:16:45.520 --> 3:16:52.240
 So if there are consequences, Twitter could give, they could just seize the $10 or seize the $20

3:16:52.240 --> 3:16:58.560
 because it's a bot. It's a malicious criminal act or whatever. It is a violation of the platform

3:16:58.560 --> 3:17:05.040
 rules. You end up seizing $10,000, give half the money to the reporter and half the money to the

3:17:05.040 --> 3:17:10.880
 Twitter platform. And... It's a really powerful idea, but that's tying it, that's adding friction

3:17:10.880 --> 3:17:15.920
 akin to the kind of friction you have in the physical world. You're tying, you have consequences,

3:17:15.920 --> 3:17:17.280
 you have real consequences.

3:17:17.280 --> 3:17:19.280
 It's putting conservation of energy.

3:17:19.280 --> 3:17:20.240
 Conservation of energy.

3:17:20.240 --> 3:17:25.280
 There's no friction, there's no nothing on this earth. Right? I mean, you can't walk across the

3:17:25.280 --> 3:17:33.280
 room without friction. Right? So friction is not bad, right? Unnecessary friction

3:17:33.280 --> 3:17:39.680
 is bad. So in this particular case, you're introducing conservation of energy. And in essence,

3:17:39.680 --> 3:17:46.320
 you're introducing the concept of consequence or truth into cyberspace. And that means if you do

3:17:46.320 --> 3:17:51.920
 want to spend up 10 million fake less Freedmen's, right?

3:17:51.920 --> 3:17:56.640
 It's going to cost you a hundred million dollars to spend up 10 million fake Lexus.

3:17:56.640 --> 3:18:00.080
 But the thing is you could do that with the dollar, but your case, you're saying

3:18:00.080 --> 3:18:06.480
 that it's more tied to physical reality when you do that with Bitcoin.

3:18:06.480 --> 3:18:11.920
 Yeah. Well, let's follow up on that idea a bit more. If you did do it with the dollar,

3:18:12.640 --> 3:18:19.120
 then the question is how to 6 billion people deposit the dollars, right? Because what you're

3:18:19.120 --> 3:18:25.200
 doing is, yeah, could you do it with a credit card? Like how do you send dollars? You have to

3:18:25.200 --> 3:18:31.840
 docks yourself. Like it's not easy. So you're talking about inputting a credit card transaction,

3:18:31.840 --> 3:18:36.560
 docksing yourself. And now you've just eliminated the 2 billion people that don't have credit cards

3:18:36.560 --> 3:18:41.120
 or don't have banks. You've also got a problem with everybody that wants to remain anonymous,

3:18:41.120 --> 3:18:47.600
 but you've also got this other problem, which is credit. You know, credit cards are expensive

3:18:47.600 --> 3:18:55.200
 transactions, low frequency, slow settlement. So do you really want to pay two and a half percent

3:18:55.200 --> 3:19:02.720
 every time you actually show a $20 deposit? And maybe you could do a Kluge version of this for

3:19:02.720 --> 3:19:10.880
 a subset of people. It's like it's 10% as good if you did it with conventional payment rails.

3:19:10.880 --> 3:19:20.240
 But what you can't do is the next idea, which is I want the orange badge to be used to give

3:19:20.240 --> 3:19:27.520
 me safe passage through cyberspace, tripping across every platform. So how do I solve the

3:19:27.520 --> 3:19:34.000
 denial of service attacks against a website? I publish a website. You hit it with a million

3:19:34.000 --> 3:19:41.680
 requests. OK, now how do I deal with that? Well, I can lock you out and I can make it a zero trust

3:19:41.680 --> 3:19:47.760
 website and then you have to be coming at me through a trusted firewall with a trusted credential. But

3:19:47.760 --> 3:19:55.440
 that's that's a pretty draconian thing. Or I could put it behind a lightning wall. A lightning wall

3:19:55.440 --> 3:20:02.000
 would be, you know, I just challenge you, Lex, you want to browse the web, you want to

3:20:02.000 --> 3:20:11.280
 show me your 100000 Satoshis. Do you have 100000 Satoshis? Click. OK, now you click away 100 times

3:20:11.280 --> 3:20:16.800
 or 1000 times. And after 1000 times, you know, well, now, Lex, you're getting offensive to take

3:20:16.800 --> 3:20:21.360
 a Satoshi from you or 10 Satoshis, a microtransaction. You want to hit me a million

3:20:21.360 --> 3:20:27.440
 times? I'm taking all your Satoshis and locking you out. What you want to do is you want to go

3:20:27.440 --> 3:20:35.760
 through 200 websites a day. And what you want every time you cross a domain, you need to be

3:20:35.760 --> 3:20:41.520
 able to, in a split second, prove that you've got some asset. And now when you cross back,

3:20:41.520 --> 3:20:48.480
 when you exit domain, you want to fetch your asset back. So how do I, in a friction free fashion,

3:20:48.480 --> 3:20:55.200
 browse through dozens or hundreds of websites, post a security deposit for state, state, state

3:20:55.200 --> 3:21:00.720
 passage, and then get it back? You couldn't afford to pay a credit card fee each time.

3:21:01.600 --> 3:21:07.040
 When you think about two and a half percent as a transaction fee, it means you trade the money

3:21:08.080 --> 3:21:14.960
 40 times and it's gone. Yeah, it's gone. Yeah. So you can't do this kind of hopping around through

3:21:14.960 --> 3:21:21.280
 the internet with this kind of verification that grounds you to physical reality. It's a really,

3:21:21.280 --> 3:21:28.480
 really interesting idea. Why hasn't that been done? I think you need two things. You need an

3:21:28.480 --> 3:21:34.400
 idea like a digital asset like Bitcoin that's a bearer instrument for final settlement. And then

3:21:34.400 --> 3:21:40.640
 you need a high speed transaction network like Lightning where the transaction cost might be a

3:21:40.640 --> 3:21:50.800
 20th of a penny or less. And if you roll the clock back 24 months, I don't think you had the Lightning

3:21:50.800 --> 3:21:56.800
 network in a stable point. It's really just the past 12 months. It's an idea you could think about

3:21:56.800 --> 3:22:05.280
 this year. And I think you need to be aware of Bitcoin as something other than like a scary

3:22:05.280 --> 3:22:12.480
 speculative asset. So I really think we're just the beginning. The embryonic stage. I have to ask

3:22:12.480 --> 3:22:19.280
 Michael Saylor, you said before, there's no second best to Bitcoin. What would be the second best?

3:22:19.280 --> 3:22:23.040
 Traditionally, there's Ethereum with smart contracts, Cardano with proof of stake,

3:22:23.600 --> 3:22:31.840
 Polkadot with interoperability between blockchains. Dogecoin has the incredible power of the meme.

3:22:31.840 --> 3:22:39.440
 Privacy with Monero. I just can keep going. There's of course, after the block size wars,

3:22:40.640 --> 3:22:43.680
 the different offshoots of Bitcoin.

3:22:43.680 --> 3:22:48.960
 I think if you decompose or segment the crypto market, you've got crypto property.

3:22:50.000 --> 3:22:56.480
 Bitcoin is the king of that. And other Bitcoin forks that wanted to be a bearer instrument store

3:22:56.480 --> 3:23:02.400
 of value would be a property, a Bitcoin cash or Litecoin, something like that.

3:23:02.960 --> 3:23:10.240
 Then you've got crypto currencies. I don't think Bitcoin is a currency because a currency I define

3:23:10.240 --> 3:23:18.240
 in nation states since a currency is a digital asset that you can transfer in a transaction

3:23:18.240 --> 3:23:23.360
 without incurring a taxable obligation. So that means it has to be a digital asset.

3:23:23.360 --> 3:23:29.200
 It's a taxable obligation. So that means it has to be a stable dollar or a stable euro or a stable

3:23:29.200 --> 3:23:33.760
 yen, a stable coin. So I think you've got crypto currencies, Tether, Circle, most famous.

3:23:34.640 --> 3:23:39.680
 Then I think you've got crypto platforms. And Ethereum is the most famous of the crypto platforms,

3:23:39.680 --> 3:23:44.720
 the platform upon which with smart contract functionality, et cetera.

3:23:45.600 --> 3:23:49.200
 And then I think you've got just crypto securities. It's just like my favorite

3:23:49.200 --> 3:23:54.400
 or whatever meme coin. And I love it because I love it. And it's attached to my game or my

3:23:54.400 --> 3:24:01.680
 company or my persona or my whatever. I think if you push me and said, what's the second best?

3:24:01.680 --> 3:24:06.800
 I would say the world wants two things. It wants crypto property as a savings account,

3:24:06.800 --> 3:24:13.920
 and it wants cryptocurrency as a checking account. And that means that the most popular thing really

3:24:13.920 --> 3:24:20.320
 is going to be a stable coin dollar. Right. And there's a maybe a fight right now. It might be

3:24:20.320 --> 3:24:28.960
 Tether. Right. But a stable dollar, because I feel like the market opportunity, it's not clear that

3:24:28.960 --> 3:24:34.240
 there'll be one that will win. The class of stable dollars is probably a one to ten trillion dollar

3:24:34.240 --> 3:24:41.760
 market easily. I think that in a crypto platform space, Ethereum will compete with Solana and

3:24:41.760 --> 3:24:46.560
 Binance Smart Chain and the like. Are there certain characteristics of any of them that

3:24:46.560 --> 3:24:53.280
 kind of stand out to you? Don't you think the competition is based on a set of features? Also,

3:24:54.320 --> 3:24:59.600
 the set of features that a cryptocurrency provides, but also the community that it provides.

3:24:59.600 --> 3:25:04.080
 Do you think the community matters in sort of the adoption, the dynamic of the adoption,

3:25:04.080 --> 3:25:08.400
 both across the developers and the investors? If I'm looking at them, I mean, the first question is,

3:25:08.400 --> 3:25:13.520
 what's the regulatory risk? How likely is it to be deemed a property versus security?

3:25:13.520 --> 3:25:18.640
 And the second is, what's the competitive risk? And the third is, what's the speed and the

3:25:18.640 --> 3:25:26.160
 performance? And all those things lead to the question of what's the security risk?

3:25:26.160 --> 3:25:34.560
 How likely is it to crash and burn? And how stable or unstable is it? And then there's the marketing

3:25:34.560 --> 3:25:39.760
 risk. I mean, there are different teams behind each of these things and communities behind them.

3:25:40.400 --> 3:25:48.800
 I think that the big cloud looming over the crypto industry is regulatory treatment of

3:25:48.800 --> 3:25:54.000
 cryptocurrencies and regulatory treatment of crypto securities and crypto platforms. And I think that

3:25:54.000 --> 3:25:58.960
 won't be determined until the end of the first Biden administration. For example, there are

3:25:58.960 --> 3:26:06.640
 people that would like only US FDIC insured banks to issue cryptocurrencies. They want JP Morgan to

3:26:06.640 --> 3:26:12.720
 issue a crypto dollar backed one to one. But then in the US right now, we have Circle and we have

3:26:12.720 --> 3:26:18.480
 other companies that are licensed entities that are backed by cash and cash equivalents, but

3:26:18.480 --> 3:26:24.080
 they're not FDIC insured banks. There's also a debate in Congress about whether state chartered

3:26:24.080 --> 3:26:30.800
 banks should be able to issue these things. And then we have Tether and others that are outside

3:26:30.800 --> 3:26:35.280
 of the US jurisdiction. They're probably not backed by cash and cash equivalents. They're

3:26:35.280 --> 3:26:43.120
 backed by stuff, and we don't know what stuff. And then finally, you have UST and DAI, which are

3:26:43.120 --> 3:26:50.480
 algorithmic stable coins that are even more innovative further outside the compliance

3:26:50.480 --> 3:26:56.320
 framework. So if you ask who's going to win, the question is really, I don't know, will the market

3:26:56.320 --> 3:27:01.200
 decide or will the regulators decide if the regulators get out of the way and the market

3:27:01.200 --> 3:27:07.360
 fall out? Well, then it's an interesting discussion. And then I think that all bets are off if the

3:27:07.360 --> 3:27:11.600
 regulators get more heavy handed with this. And I think you could have the same discussion with

3:27:11.600 --> 3:27:18.000
 crypto properties like the DeFi exchanges and the crypto exchanges. The SEC would like to regulate

3:27:18.000 --> 3:27:22.480
 the crypto exchanges. They'd like to regulate the DeFi exchanges. That means they may regulate the

3:27:22.480 --> 3:27:30.000
 crypto platforms and at what rate and in what fashion. And so I think that I could give you

3:27:30.000 --> 3:27:38.080
 an opinion if it was limited to competition and the current regulatory regime. But I think that

3:27:38.080 --> 3:27:48.480
 the regulations are so fast moving and it's so uncertain that you can't make a decision

3:27:48.480 --> 3:27:53.680
 without considering the potential actions of the regulators.

3:27:53.680 --> 3:27:59.680
 I hope the regulators get out of the way. Can you steel me on the case that Dogecoin is,

3:27:59.680 --> 3:28:04.480
 I guess, the second best cryptocurrency if you don't consider Bitcoin a cryptocurrency,

3:28:04.480 --> 3:28:08.800
 Bitcoin a cryptocurrency, but instead a crypto property?

3:28:08.800 --> 3:28:14.560
 I would classify it as crypto property because the US dollar is a currency. So unless your

3:28:14.560 --> 3:28:20.160
 crypto asset is pegged algorithmically or stably to the value of the dollar is not a currency,

3:28:20.160 --> 3:28:22.160
 it's a property or it's an asset.

3:28:22.880 --> 3:28:28.480
 So then can you steel me on the case that Dogecoin is the best cryptocurrency then?

3:28:29.520 --> 3:28:31.840
 Because Bitcoin is not even in that list.

3:28:31.840 --> 3:28:36.320
 The debate is going to be whether it's property or security. And there's a debate whether it's

3:28:36.320 --> 3:28:40.480
 decentralized enough. So let's assume it was decentralized.

3:28:40.480 --> 3:28:40.980
 Yeah.

3:28:41.600 --> 3:28:48.000
 Well, it's increasing at not quite five, what, 5% a year inflation rate, but it's not 5%

3:28:48.000 --> 3:28:55.840
 exponentially. It's like a plus 5 million, 5% something captain is less. I forget the

3:28:55.840 --> 3:29:01.040
 exact number, but it's an inflationary property. It's got a lower inflation rate

3:29:01.040 --> 3:29:08.960
 than the US dollar. And it's got a much lower inflation rate than many other fiat currencies.

3:29:08.960 --> 3:29:10.640
 So I think you could say that.

3:29:10.640 --> 3:29:18.880
 But don't you see the power of meme, the power of ideas, the power of fun or whatever mechanism

3:29:18.880 --> 3:29:24.160
 is used to captivate a community?

3:29:24.160 --> 3:29:29.520
 I do, but there are meme stocks. It doesn't absolve you of your ethical and securities

3:29:29.520 --> 3:29:36.720
 liabilities if you're promoting it. So I don't have a problem with people buying a stock.

3:29:37.920 --> 3:29:46.640
 It's just the way I divide the world is there's investment, there's saving, and there's speculation

3:29:46.640 --> 3:29:53.280
 and there's trading. So Bitcoin is an asset for saving. If you want to save money for

3:29:53.280 --> 3:30:00.400
 100 years, you don't really want to take on execution risk or the like. So you're just

3:30:00.400 --> 3:30:05.760
 buying something to hold forever. For you to actually endorse something as a property,

3:30:06.400 --> 3:30:10.400
 like if you said to me, Mike, what should I buy for the next 100 years? I say, well,

3:30:10.400 --> 3:30:15.760
 some amount of real estate, some amount of scarce collectibles, some amount of Bitcoin,

3:30:15.760 --> 3:30:20.640
 right? You can run your company, right? But running your company is an investment. So

3:30:20.640 --> 3:30:24.960
 the savings are properties. If you said, what should I invest in? I'd say, well, here's

3:30:24.960 --> 3:30:29.120
 a list of good companies, private companies. You can start your own company. That's an

3:30:29.120 --> 3:30:36.880
 investment, right? If you said, what should I trade? Well, I'm trading as like a proprietary

3:30:36.880 --> 3:30:42.640
 thing. I don't have any special insight into that. If you're a good trader, you know you

3:30:42.640 --> 3:30:49.840
 are. If you said to me, what should you speculate in? We talk about meme stocks and meme stocks

3:30:49.840 --> 3:30:56.560
 and meme coins, and it kind of sits up there. It sits right in the same space with what

3:30:56.560 --> 3:31:01.120
 horse should you bet on and what sports team should you gamble on and should you bet on

3:31:01.120 --> 3:31:07.840
 black six times in a row and double down each time. I mean, it's fun, but at the end of

3:31:07.840 --> 3:31:17.200
 the day, it's a speculation, right? You can't build a civilization on it. It's not an institutional

3:31:17.200 --> 3:31:23.600
 asset. And in fact, where I'd leave it, right, is Bitcoin is clearly digital property, which

3:31:23.600 --> 3:31:28.800
 makes it an institutional grade investable asset for a public company, a public figure,

3:31:28.800 --> 3:31:37.200
 a public investor, or anybody that's risk adverse. I think that the top 100 other cryptos

3:31:37.200 --> 3:31:42.640
 are like venture capital investments. And if you're a VC and if you're a qualified technical

3:31:42.640 --> 3:31:47.200
 investor and you have a pool of capital and you can take that kind of risk, then you can

3:31:47.200 --> 3:31:52.640
 parse through that and form opinions. It's just orders of magnitude more risky because

3:31:52.640 --> 3:31:59.120
 of competition, because of ambition, and because of regulation. And if you take the meme coins,

3:31:59.120 --> 3:32:05.680
 it's like when some rapper comes out with a meme coin, it's like maybe it'll peak when

3:32:05.680 --> 3:32:13.360
 I hear about it, right? I mean, SHIB was created as the coin such that it had so many zeros

3:32:13.360 --> 3:32:18.720
 after the decimal point that when you looked at it on the exchanges, it always showed zero,

3:32:18.720 --> 3:32:24.320
 zero, zero, zero. And it wasn't until like six months after it got popular that they

3:32:24.320 --> 3:32:27.680
 started expanding the display so you could see whether the price had changed.

3:32:27.680 --> 3:32:33.680
 That's speculation. You've been, maybe you can correct me, but you've been critical of Elon

3:32:33.680 --> 3:32:39.600
 Musk in the past in the crypto space. Where do you stand on Elon's effect on Bitcoin and

3:32:39.600 --> 3:32:46.080
 cryptocurrency in general these days? I believe that Bitcoin is a massive breakthrough for the

3:32:46.080 --> 3:32:51.360
 human race that will cure half the problems in the world and generate hundreds of trillions of

3:32:51.360 --> 3:32:59.280
 dollars of economic value to the civilization. And I believe that it's in an early stage

3:32:59.280 --> 3:33:04.000
 where many people don't understand it, and they're afraid of it, and there's FUD,

3:33:04.000 --> 3:33:09.760
 and there's uncertainty, there's doubt, and there's fear, and there's a very noisy crypto

3:33:09.760 --> 3:33:17.920
 world. And there's 15,000 other cryptos that are seeking relevance. And I think most of the FUD

3:33:19.360 --> 3:33:24.880
 is actually fueled by the other crypto entrepreneurs. So the environmental FUD and

3:33:24.880 --> 3:33:31.040
 the other types of uncertainty that surround Bitcoin, generally they're not coming from

3:33:31.040 --> 3:33:37.520
 legitimate environmentalists. They don't come from legitimate critics. They actually are guerrilla

3:33:37.520 --> 3:33:44.720
 marketing campaigns that are being financed and fueled by other crypto entrepreneurs

3:33:45.840 --> 3:33:52.320
 because they have an interest in doing so. So if I look at the constructive path forward,

3:33:52.320 --> 3:33:59.200
 first, I think it'd be very constructive for corporations to embrace Bitcoin and build

3:33:59.200 --> 3:34:06.000
 applications on top of it. You don't need to fix it. There's nothing wrong with it, right? Like

3:34:06.000 --> 3:34:10.880
 when you put it on a layer two and a layer three, it moves a billion times a second at the speed of

3:34:10.880 --> 3:34:18.960
 light. So every beautiful, cool DeFi application, every crypto application, everything you could

3:34:18.960 --> 3:34:27.760
 imagine you might want to do, you can do with a legitimate company and a legitimate website or

3:34:27.760 --> 3:34:36.320
 mobile application sitting on top of Bitcoin or Lightning if you want to. So I think that

3:34:37.120 --> 3:34:42.480
 to the extent that people do that, that's going to be better for the world. If you consider what

3:34:42.480 --> 3:34:50.160
 holds people back, I think it's just misperceptions about what Bitcoin is. So I'm a big fan of just

3:34:50.160 --> 3:34:56.880
 educating people. If you're not going to commercialize it, then just educate people on

3:34:56.880 --> 3:35:04.320
 what it is. So for example, Bitcoin is the most efficient use of energy in the world by far,

3:35:05.040 --> 3:35:09.840
 right? Most people don't necessarily perceive that or realize that. But if you were to take

3:35:09.840 --> 3:35:16.400
 any metric, energy intensity, you put like $2 billion worth of electricity in the network

3:35:16.400 --> 3:35:25.600
 every year and it's worth $850 billion. There is no industry in the real world, right, that is that

3:35:25.600 --> 3:35:32.240
 energy efficient. Not only that energy efficient, it's also the most sustainable industry. We do

3:35:32.240 --> 3:35:40.640
 surveys. 58% of Bitcoin mining energy is sustainable. So there's a very good story.

3:35:40.640 --> 3:35:46.080
 In fact, every other industry, planes, trains, automobiles, construction, food, medicine,

3:35:46.080 --> 3:35:54.400
 everything else is less clean, less efficient. So the basic debate was...

3:35:54.400 --> 3:35:58.800
 I wouldn't say there is a debate. I would just say that to the extent that the Bitcoin community

3:35:58.800 --> 3:36:07.600
 had any issue with Elon, it was just this environmental uncertainty that he fueled

3:36:07.600 --> 3:36:12.400
 in a couple of his tweets, right? Which I think just is very distracting.

3:36:13.040 --> 3:36:17.440
 But that was one of them. But I think it's like the Bitcoin maximalists, but generally,

3:36:17.440 --> 3:36:25.120
 the crypto community, what you call the crypto entrepreneurs are... It's also... They're using

3:36:25.120 --> 3:36:35.280
 it for investment, for speculation, and therefore get very passionate about people's celebrities,

3:36:35.280 --> 3:36:42.800
 including you, like famous people, saying positive stuff about any one particular

3:36:43.920 --> 3:36:51.280
 crypto thing you can buy in Coinbase. And so they might be unhappy with Elon

3:36:51.280 --> 3:36:56.480
 Musk that he's promoting Bitcoin and then not, and then promoting Dogecoin, then not.

3:37:00.480 --> 3:37:04.480
 There's so much emotion tied up in the communication on this topic.

3:37:05.360 --> 3:37:07.840
 And I think that's where a lot of the...

3:37:08.480 --> 3:37:13.520
 Look, I don't have a criticism of Elon Musk. He's free to do whatever he wishes to do.

3:37:13.520 --> 3:37:20.720
 It's his... In fact, Elon Musk is the second largest supporter of Bitcoin in the world.

3:37:21.280 --> 3:37:26.160
 I think that the Bitcoin community tends to eat its own quite a bit. It tends to be very

3:37:27.920 --> 3:37:34.640
 self critical. And instead of saying, well, Elon is more supportive of Bitcoin

3:37:34.640 --> 3:37:41.440
 than the other 10,000 people in the world with serious amounts of money, they focus upon...

3:37:41.440 --> 3:37:46.080
 Yeah, this is strange. Eating your own is just...

3:37:46.080 --> 3:37:51.200
 I mean, I think he's free to do what he wants to do. And I think he's done a lot of good for

3:37:51.200 --> 3:37:56.800
 Bitcoin in putting it on the balance sheet of Tesla and holding it. And I think that

3:37:56.800 --> 3:38:02.640
 sent a very powerful message. Do you have advice for young people?

3:38:02.640 --> 3:38:07.120
 You've had a heck of a life. You've done quite a lot of things.

3:38:07.120 --> 3:38:12.880
 Start before MIT, but starting with MIT. Is there advice here for young people in high school and

3:38:12.880 --> 3:38:22.160
 college, how to have a career they can be proud of, how to have a life they can be proud of?

3:38:23.040 --> 3:38:32.080
 I was asked by somebody for quick advice for his young children. He had twins when they

3:38:32.080 --> 3:38:37.760
 enter adulthood. He said, give me your advice for them in a letter. I'm going to give it to them

3:38:37.760 --> 3:38:44.800
 when they turn 21 or something. So then he handed... I was at a party and then he handed me

3:38:44.800 --> 3:38:48.320
 this sheet of paper and I thought, oh, he wants me to write it down right now. So I sat down,

3:38:48.320 --> 3:38:51.920
 I started writing and I figured, well, what would you want to tell someone at age 21?

3:38:53.200 --> 3:38:54.320
 You wrote it down.

3:38:54.320 --> 3:38:58.080
 So I wrote it down. And then I tweeted it and it's sitting on Twitter, but I tell you what I said.

3:38:58.080 --> 3:39:08.560
 I said, my advice if you're entering adulthood, focus your energy, guard your time, train your

3:39:08.560 --> 3:39:20.640
 mind, train your body, think for yourself, curate your friends, curate your environment,

3:39:20.640 --> 3:39:29.920
 keep your promises, stay cheerful and constructive, and upgrade the world. That was the 10.

3:39:30.480 --> 3:39:37.600
 Upgrade the world. That's an interesting choice of words. Upgrade the world. Upgrade the world.

3:39:37.600 --> 3:39:39.280
 It's like an engineering train.

3:39:39.280 --> 3:39:43.200
 Focus your energy. It's a very, yeah, it's a very engineering themed...

3:39:43.200 --> 3:39:50.560
 Keep your promises too. That's an interesting one.

3:39:50.560 --> 3:39:59.360
 I think most people suffer because they don't focus. I think the big risk in this world is

3:39:59.360 --> 3:40:06.080
 there's too much of everything. You can sit and watch chess videos 100 hours a week and

3:40:06.080 --> 3:40:12.880
 you'll never get through all the chess videos. There's too much of every possible thing,

3:40:12.880 --> 3:40:20.400
 too much of every good thing. So figuring out what you want to do and then everything will suck

3:40:20.400 --> 3:40:25.280
 up your time, right? There's 100 streaming channels to binge watch on. So you got to

3:40:25.280 --> 3:40:33.120
 guard your time and then train your body, train your mind and control who's around you, control

3:40:33.680 --> 3:40:41.520
 what surrounds you. So ultimately in a world where there's too much of everything, then

3:40:41.520 --> 3:40:46.320
 It's like those laser eyes. It's like those laser eyes. You have to focus

3:40:48.720 --> 3:40:50.400
 on just a few of those things.

3:40:51.280 --> 3:40:56.400
 Yeah. I mean, I got a thousand opinions we could talk about and I could pursue a thousand things,

3:40:56.400 --> 3:41:04.080
 but I don't expect to be successful. And I'm not sure that my opinion in any of the 999 is any more

3:41:04.080 --> 3:41:12.400
 valid than the leader of thought in that area. So how about if I just focus upon one thing

3:41:13.520 --> 3:41:19.520
 and then deliver the best I can in the one thing. That's the laser eye message.

3:41:20.560 --> 3:41:22.320
 The rest get you distracted.

3:41:22.320 --> 3:41:26.640
 Well, how do you achieve that? Do you find yourself, given where you are in life,

3:41:26.640 --> 3:41:32.960
 having to say no a lot? Or just focus comes naturally when you just ignore everything?

3:41:32.960 --> 3:41:35.280
 So how do you achieve that focus?

3:41:36.640 --> 3:41:38.880
 I think it helps if people know what you're focused on.

3:41:40.160 --> 3:41:43.200
 So everything about you just radiates that people know.

3:41:44.480 --> 3:41:50.000
 If they know what you're focused on, then you won't get so many other things coming your way.

3:41:52.800 --> 3:41:59.040
 If you dolly or if you flirt with 27 different things,

3:41:59.040 --> 3:42:03.760
 then you're going to get approached by people in each of the 27 communities, right?

3:42:03.760 --> 3:42:11.360
 You mentioned getting a PhD and giving your roots at MIT. Do you think there's all kinds of

3:42:12.080 --> 3:42:18.400
 journeys you can take to educate yourself? Do you think a PhD or school is still worth it?

3:42:20.160 --> 3:42:23.360
 Or is there other paths through life that...

3:42:23.360 --> 3:42:26.640
 Is it worth it if you have to pay for it? Is it worth it if you spend the time on it?

3:42:26.640 --> 3:42:30.480
 Yeah. The time and the money is a big cost.

3:42:32.880 --> 3:42:34.640
 Time probably the bigger one, right?

3:42:34.640 --> 3:42:42.880
 It seems clear to me that the world wants more specialists. It wants you to be an expert

3:42:43.680 --> 3:42:52.240
 and to focus on one area. And it's punishing generalists, jack of all trades,

3:42:52.240 --> 3:42:56.880
 especially people that are generalists in the physical realm. Because if you're a specialist

3:42:56.880 --> 3:43:01.920
 in the digital realm, you might very well... You're the person with 700,000 followers on

3:43:02.720 --> 3:43:10.320
 Twitter and you show them how to tie knots. Or you're the banjo player with 1.8 million followers.

3:43:10.320 --> 3:43:19.120
 And when everybody types banjo, it's you, right? And so the world wants people that do something

3:43:19.120 --> 3:43:28.000
 well. And then it wants to stamp out 18 million copies of them. And so that argues in favor of

3:43:28.000 --> 3:43:34.240
 focus. Now, the definition of a PhD is someone with enough of an education that they're capable

3:43:34.240 --> 3:43:41.040
 of or have made. I guess to get a PhD, technically, you have to have done a dissertation where you

3:43:41.040 --> 3:43:47.120
 made a seminal contribution to the body of human knowledge. And if you haven't done that,

3:43:47.120 --> 3:43:53.200
 technically, you have a master's degree, but you're not a doctor. So if you're interested

3:43:53.200 --> 3:44:00.400
 in any of the academic disciplines that a PhD would be granted for, then I can see that being

3:44:00.400 --> 3:44:07.120
 a reasonable pursuit. But there are many people that are specialists. You know the agitator?

3:44:07.120 --> 3:44:08.800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3:44:08.800 --> 3:44:10.160
 The agitator on YouTube?

3:44:10.160 --> 3:44:11.040
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3:44:11.040 --> 3:44:13.920
 He's the world's greatest chess commentator.

3:44:13.920 --> 3:44:14.560
 Yeah.

3:44:14.560 --> 3:44:18.640
 And I've watched his career, and he's gotten progressively better, and he's really good.

3:44:18.640 --> 3:44:19.760
 He's going to love hearing this.

3:44:20.640 --> 3:44:25.680
 Yeah, if the agitator hears this, I'm a big fan of the agitator. I have to cut myself off,

3:44:25.680 --> 3:44:29.920
 right? Because otherwise, you'll watch the entire Paul Morphy saga for your weekend.

3:44:30.640 --> 3:44:36.640
 But the point really is YouTube is full of experts who are specialists in something,

3:44:36.640 --> 3:44:45.520
 and they rise to the top of their profession. And Twitter is too, and the internet is. So I

3:44:45.520 --> 3:44:54.240
 would advocate that you figure out what you're passionate about and what you're good at, and you

3:44:54.240 --> 3:45:03.360
 do focus on it. Especially if the thing that you're doing can be automated. The problem is,

3:45:03.360 --> 3:45:10.640
 back to that 500,000 algebra teacher type comment, the problem is if it is possible to be automated,

3:45:10.640 --> 3:45:20.080
 then over time, someone's probably going to automate it, and that squeezes the state space

3:45:20.080 --> 3:45:26.400
 of everybody else. It's like after the lockdowns, it used to be there were all these local bands

3:45:26.400 --> 3:45:31.360
 that played in bars, and everyone went to the bar to see the local band. And then during the

3:45:31.360 --> 3:45:37.200
 lockdown, you would have like these six super groups, and they would all get 500,000 or a

3:45:37.200 --> 3:45:45.840
 million followers, and all these smaller local bands just got no attention at all.

3:45:45.840 --> 3:45:51.440
 Well, the interesting thing is one of those 500,000 algebra teachers is likely to be part of

3:45:51.440 --> 3:46:00.080
 the automation. So it's like, it's an opportunity for you to think, where's my field, my discipline,

3:46:00.080 --> 3:46:04.560
 evolving into? I talked to a bunch of librarians, just happened to be friends with librarians,

3:46:04.560 --> 3:46:12.400
 and libraries will probably be evolving. And it's up to you as a librarian to be one of the few

3:46:12.400 --> 3:46:18.800
 that remain in the rubble. If you're going to give commentary on Shakespeare plays,

3:46:18.800 --> 3:46:23.520
 I want you to basically do it for every Shakespeare play. I want you to be the Shakespeare dude,

3:46:23.520 --> 3:46:33.600
 because once I, just like Lex, you're like, you're the deep thinking podcaster, right?

3:46:33.600 --> 3:46:42.560
 You're the podcaster that goes after the deep intellectual conversations. And once I get

3:46:42.560 --> 3:46:49.840
 comfortable with you, and I like you, then I start binge watching Lex. But if you changed

3:46:49.840 --> 3:46:55.680
 your format through 16 different formats, so that you could compete with 16 different other

3:46:55.680 --> 3:47:01.760
 personalities on YouTube, you probably wouldn't beat any of them, right? You would probably just

3:47:01.760 --> 3:47:06.880
 kind of sink into the, you're the number two or number three guy, you're not the number one guy

3:47:06.880 --> 3:47:14.480
 in the format. And I think that the algorithm, right, the Twitter algorithm and the YouTube

3:47:14.480 --> 3:47:21.200
 algorithm, they really reward the person that's focused on message, consistent. The world wants

3:47:21.200 --> 3:47:26.720
 somebody they can trust that's consistent and reliable. And they kind of want to know what

3:47:26.720 --> 3:47:35.280
 they're getting into because, and this is taken for granted maybe, but there's 10 million people

3:47:35.280 --> 3:47:42.640
 vying for every hour of your time. And so the fact that anybody gives you any time at all is a huge

3:47:42.640 --> 3:47:47.680
 privilege, right? And you should be thanking them. And you should respect their time.

3:47:48.240 --> 3:47:52.720
 It's interesting. Like everything you said is very interesting. But of course, from my perspective,

3:47:52.720 --> 3:47:58.800
 and probably from your perspective, my actual life has nothing to do with, it's just being focused

3:47:58.800 --> 3:48:06.960
 on stuff. And in my case, it's like focus on doing the thing I really enjoy doing and being myself

3:48:06.960 --> 3:48:12.800
 and not caring about anything else. Like I don't care about views or likes or attention. And that,

3:48:12.800 --> 3:48:17.040
 just maintaining that focus is the way, from an individual perspective, you live that life.

3:48:17.840 --> 3:48:24.800
 But yeah, it does seem that there's the world and technology is rewarding the specialization

3:48:24.800 --> 3:48:31.520
 and creating bigger and bigger platforms for the different specializations. And that lifts all

3:48:31.520 --> 3:48:36.080
 boats, actually, because the specializations get better and better and better at teaching people to

3:48:36.080 --> 3:48:40.720
 do specific things and they educate themselves. And it's just, everybody gets more and more

3:48:40.720 --> 3:48:47.360
 knowledgeable and more and more empowered. The reward for authenticity more than offsets

3:48:47.360 --> 3:48:53.680
 the specificity with which you pursue your mission. It's like, another way to say it is like,

3:48:53.680 --> 3:48:58.640
 nobody wants to read advertising. Like if you were to spend a hundred million dollars

3:48:58.640 --> 3:49:08.240
 advertising your thing, I probably wouldn't want to watch it. But we see the death of that.

3:49:08.240 --> 3:49:14.480
 And so the commercial shows are losing their audiences and the authentic

3:49:15.040 --> 3:49:21.120
 specialists or the authentic artists are gaining their audience.

3:49:21.120 --> 3:49:28.480
 And that's a beautiful thing. Speaking of deep thinking, you're just a human. Your life ends.

3:49:29.520 --> 3:49:36.480
 You've accumulated so much wisdom, so much money, but the ride ends. Do you think about that?

3:49:36.480 --> 3:49:41.520
 Do you ponder your death, your mortality? Are you afraid of it?

3:49:41.520 --> 3:49:50.880
 When I go, all my assets will flow into a foundation and the foundation's mission is to make

3:49:50.880 --> 3:50:01.520
 education free for everybody forever. And if I'm able to contribute to the creation of a more

3:50:01.520 --> 3:50:06.640
 perfect monetary system, then maybe that foundation will go on forever.

3:50:06.640 --> 3:50:14.320
 The idea, the foundation of the idea. So each of the foundations.

3:50:14.320 --> 3:50:19.280
 It's not clear we're on the S curve of immortal life yet. Like that's a biological question.

3:50:19.280 --> 3:50:24.480
 And you asked that, you know, on some of your other interviews a lot. I think that we are on

3:50:24.480 --> 3:50:33.440
 the threshold of immortal life for ideas or immortal life for certain institutions.

3:50:33.440 --> 3:50:40.640
 Or computer programs. So if we can fix the money, then you can create a technically perfected

3:50:40.640 --> 3:50:47.360
 endowment. And then the question really is, what are your ideas? What do you want to leave behind?

3:50:47.360 --> 3:50:53.280
 And so if it's a park, then you endow the park, right? If it's free education, you endow that.

3:50:53.280 --> 3:50:58.640
 If it's some other ethical idea, right?

3:50:58.640 --> 3:51:06.560
 Does it make you sad that there's something that you've endowed, some very powerful idea

3:51:07.280 --> 3:51:12.880
 of digital energy that you put out into the world, you help put it into the world,

3:51:13.680 --> 3:51:20.880
 and your mind, your conscious mind will no longer be there to experience it.

3:51:21.680 --> 3:51:23.040
 It's just gone forever.

3:51:23.040 --> 3:51:30.640
 I'd rather think that the thing that Satoshi taught us is you should do your part during

3:51:30.640 --> 3:51:33.440
 some phase of the journey, and then you should get out of the way.

3:51:35.440 --> 3:51:42.800
 I think Steve Jobs said something similar to that effect in a very, very famous speech one day,

3:51:42.800 --> 3:51:47.920
 which is, you know, death is a natural part of life, and it makes way for the next generation.

3:51:47.920 --> 3:51:53.520
 And I think the goal is you upgrade the world, right? You leave it a better place,

3:51:53.520 --> 3:52:03.600
 but you get out of the way. And I think when that breaks down, you know, bad things happen.

3:52:04.800 --> 3:52:07.920
 I think nature cleanses itself. There's a cycle of life.

3:52:09.360 --> 3:52:13.600
 And speaking of one of great people who did a great job,

3:52:13.600 --> 3:52:19.760
 and speaking of one of great people who did also get out of the way is George Washington,

3:52:19.760 --> 3:52:26.640
 so hopefully when you get out of the way, nobody's bleeding you to death in hope of helping you.

3:52:29.200 --> 3:52:34.720
 What do you think, to do a bit of a callback, what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

3:52:34.720 --> 3:52:39.840
 What's the meaning of life? Why are we here? We talked about the rise of human civilization.

3:52:39.840 --> 3:52:46.480
 It seems like we're engineers at heart. We build cool stuff, better and better use of energy,

3:52:47.040 --> 3:52:51.840
 channeling energy to be productive. Why? What's it all for?

3:52:55.280 --> 3:52:57.040
 You're getting metaphysical on me.

3:52:57.040 --> 3:53:00.640
 Very. There's a beautiful boat to the left of us. Like, why do we do that? This

3:53:01.200 --> 3:53:07.360
 boat that sailed the ocean. Then we build models of it to celebrate great engineering of the past.

3:53:07.360 --> 3:53:15.840
 To engineer is divine. You can make lots of arguments as well. We're here to entertain

3:53:15.840 --> 3:53:21.520
 ourselves or we're here to create something that's beautiful or something that's functional.

3:53:22.160 --> 3:53:25.600
 I think if you're an engineer, you entertain yourself by creating something that's both

3:53:25.600 --> 3:53:31.600
 beautiful and functional. So I think all three of those things, it's entertaining, but it's ethical.

3:53:31.600 --> 3:53:38.000
 You know, you got to admire, you know, the first person that built a bridge, crossing a chasm,

3:53:38.000 --> 3:53:42.480
 or the first person to work out the problem of how to get running water to a village,

3:53:44.000 --> 3:53:52.080
 the first person to figure out how to, you know, dam up a river, or mastered agriculture,

3:53:52.080 --> 3:53:56.800
 or the guy that figured out, you know, how to grow fruit on trees or created orchards,

3:53:56.800 --> 3:54:01.600
 you know, and maybe one day he had like 10 fruit trees, he's pretty proud of himself.

3:54:02.160 --> 3:54:08.480
 So that's functional. There is also something to that, just like you said, that's just beautiful.

3:54:08.480 --> 3:54:14.880
 It does get you closer to, like you said, the divine. Something,

3:54:17.200 --> 3:54:25.760
 when you step back and look at the entirety of it, a collective of humans using a beautiful

3:54:25.760 --> 3:54:35.440
 invention, or creation, or just something about this instrument is creating a beautiful piece of music.

3:54:37.440 --> 3:54:42.480
 That seems just right. That's what we're here for. Whatever the divine is, it seems like we're here

3:54:42.480 --> 3:54:47.520
 for that. And I, of course, love talking to you because from the engineering perspective,

3:54:47.520 --> 3:54:50.480
 the functional is ultimately the mechanism towards the beauty.

3:54:50.480 --> 3:54:55.440
 Isn't there something beautiful about making the world a better place for people that you love,

3:54:56.080 --> 3:54:58.800
 your friends, your family, or yourself?

3:55:02.800 --> 3:55:11.120
 When you think about the entire arc of human existence, and you roll the clock back 500,000

3:55:11.120 --> 3:55:16.320
 years, and you think about every struggle of everyone that came before us and everything

3:55:16.320 --> 3:55:25.120
 they had to overcome in order to put you here right now, you got to admire that, right? You

3:55:25.120 --> 3:55:32.000
 got to respect that. That's a heck of a gift they gave us, but it's also a heck of a responsibility.

3:55:33.280 --> 3:55:40.160
 Don't screw it up. If I dropped you 500,000 years ago, and I said, figure out steel refining,

3:55:40.160 --> 3:55:48.160
 or figure out silicon chips, fabric production, or whatever it is.

3:55:48.160 --> 3:55:50.000
 Fly, or fire.

3:55:50.000 --> 3:55:55.280
 And so now we're here, and I guess the way you repay them is you fix everything in front

3:55:55.280 --> 3:56:02.880
 of your face you can, right? And that means to someone like Elon, it means get us off the planet,

3:56:02.880 --> 3:56:09.280
 right? To someone like me, it's like, I think, you know, fix the energy in the system.

3:56:09.280 --> 3:56:13.280
 And that gives me hope. Michael, this was an incredible conversation. You're an incredible

3:56:13.280 --> 3:56:18.160
 human. It's a huge honor you would sit down with me. Thank you so much for talking to me.

3:56:18.160 --> 3:56:19.680
 Yeah, thanks for having me, Lex.

3:56:20.480 --> 3:56:24.800
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Michael Saylor. To support this podcast,

3:56:24.800 --> 3:56:33.840
 please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with a few words from

3:56:33.840 --> 3:56:42.160
 Francis Bacon. Money is a great servant, but a bad master. Thank you for listening,

3:56:42.160 --> 3:56:56.160
 and hope to see you next time.
