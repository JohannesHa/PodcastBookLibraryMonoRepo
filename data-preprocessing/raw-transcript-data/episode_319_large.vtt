00:00.000 --> 00:01.660
 I mean, I've definitely experienced moments

00:01.660 --> 00:05.460
 where I didn't want to do anything but chess.

00:05.460 --> 00:07.040
 I'd also say that's pretty universal.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.400
 I think if you want to be the best at anything you do

00:09.400 --> 00:12.040
 or any sport, you have to be that level of obsessed.

00:13.880 --> 00:15.160
 The following is a conversation

00:15.160 --> 00:17.480
 with Alexandra and Andrea Botez.

00:17.480 --> 00:20.100
 They're sisters, professional chess players,

00:20.100 --> 00:23.900
 commentators, educators, entertainers, and streamers.

00:23.900 --> 00:28.120
 Their channel is called Botez Live on Twitch and YouTube.

00:28.120 --> 00:29.920
 I highly recommend you check it out.

00:30.840 --> 00:33.640
 A small side note about the currently ongoing controversy

00:33.640 --> 00:36.560
 in the chess world, where the 19 year old grandmaster,

00:36.560 --> 00:40.960
 Hans Niemann, beat Magnus Carlsen at the Sink Field Cup.

00:40.960 --> 00:43.960
 After this, Magnus, for the first time ever,

00:43.960 --> 00:46.720
 withdrew from the tournament, implying with a tweet

00:46.720 --> 00:48.380
 that there may have been cheating

00:48.380 --> 00:50.840
 or at least something shady going on.

00:50.840 --> 00:53.600
 Folks like the grandmaster, Hikaru Nakamura,

00:53.600 --> 00:56.120
 fanned the flames of cheating accusations,

00:56.120 --> 00:59.320
 and the internet made a bunch of proposals

00:59.320 --> 01:01.380
 on how the cheating could have been done,

01:01.380 --> 01:05.020
 and it ranged from the ridiculous to the hilarious,

01:05.020 --> 01:06.000
 often both.

01:06.840 --> 01:10.520
 Hans himself came out and said that he has cheated before

01:10.520 --> 01:14.480
 when he was 12 and 16 on random online games

01:14.480 --> 01:16.420
 to jack up his rating.

01:16.420 --> 01:19.920
 But he said that he has never cheated in person

01:19.920 --> 01:21.240
 over the board.

01:21.240 --> 01:24.240
 Danny Wrench from chess.com, who I've spoken with,

01:24.240 --> 01:27.680
 may make a statement in response to Hans's claims soon.

01:28.580 --> 01:30.800
 Folks like grandmaster Jakob Luegge

01:30.800 --> 01:32.920
 spoke to his experience training Hans Niemann

01:32.920 --> 01:36.240
 and has said that his memory and intuition

01:36.240 --> 01:38.040
 were quite brilliant.

01:38.040 --> 01:40.500
 So as you see, there's a lot of perspectives on this.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.680
 ChessBase has a good summary of the saga

01:42.680 --> 01:45.120
 that I'll link in the description.

01:45.120 --> 01:48.020
 Also note that this is so quickly moving

01:48.020 --> 01:50.620
 that new stuff might come out between me recording this

01:50.620 --> 01:52.320
 and publishing the episode,

01:52.320 --> 01:53.720
 but I thought I'd mention this anyway

01:53.720 --> 01:56.360
 since the episode with the Botas sisters

01:56.360 --> 01:58.400
 is a conversation about chess

01:58.400 --> 02:01.200
 and was recorded shortly before the controversy,

02:01.200 --> 02:02.680
 so we didn't talk about it.

02:03.720 --> 02:06.920
 I'm considering having Hans on this podcast

02:06.920 --> 02:09.360
 and also Magnus back on the podcast,

02:09.360 --> 02:11.480
 and maybe others like Hikaru

02:11.480 --> 02:14.880
 or folks from chess.com's anti cheat staff

02:14.880 --> 02:16.460
 to discuss their really interesting

02:16.460 --> 02:18.660
 cheating detection algorithms,

02:18.660 --> 02:21.800
 but I may also just stay out of it.

02:21.800 --> 02:24.080
 I find chess to be a beautiful game

02:24.080 --> 02:25.440
 and the chess community

02:25.440 --> 02:28.040
 full of fascinating, brilliant people,

02:28.040 --> 02:30.320
 and so I'll keep having conversations like these

02:30.320 --> 02:31.520
 about chess.

02:31.520 --> 02:32.800
 It's fun.

02:32.800 --> 02:36.880
 My goal with this podcast and in general as a human being

02:36.880 --> 02:39.960
 is to increase the amount of love in the world.

02:39.960 --> 02:43.000
 Sometimes that involves celebrating brilliance and beauty

02:43.000 --> 02:46.280
 in science, in art, in chess.

02:46.280 --> 02:48.620
 Sometimes it involves empathetic conversations

02:48.620 --> 02:52.120
 with controversial figures that seek to understand,

02:52.120 --> 02:53.880
 not to ride.

02:53.880 --> 02:56.120
 Sometimes it involves standing against

02:56.120 --> 02:57.880
 the internet lynch mob,

02:57.880 --> 03:00.120
 as the ChessBase article calls it,

03:00.120 --> 03:03.920
 to hear the story of a human being who is under attack,

03:03.920 --> 03:07.160
 even if it means I get attacked in the process as well.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.920
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

03:09.920 --> 03:12.420
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

03:12.420 --> 03:13.560
 in the description,

03:13.560 --> 03:14.760
 and now, dear friends,

03:14.760 --> 03:19.000
 here's Alexandra and Andrea Botas.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.920
 You just got back from Italy.

03:20.920 --> 03:22.640
 What's the most memorable thing?

03:22.640 --> 03:24.100
 I was just there recently as well.

03:24.100 --> 03:28.000
 It was very chaotic because we went out on a whim

03:28.000 --> 03:30.920
 and we only had our first hotel booked,

03:30.920 --> 03:33.920
 and then we rented a car and drove around all of the cities

03:33.920 --> 03:35.580
 and went to like five different cities

03:35.580 --> 03:37.680
 in about a week and a bit.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.340
 So I think it was just the variety

03:39.340 --> 03:40.840
 of seeing so many different places

03:40.840 --> 03:42.680
 when we're used to being at home all the time,

03:42.680 --> 03:45.320
 and Andrea, is yours your luggage?

03:45.320 --> 03:48.020
 Yeah, I would say it was the most stressful vacation

03:48.020 --> 03:49.540
 we've been in in our life,

03:49.540 --> 03:51.560
 and it was a valuable learning lesson

03:51.560 --> 03:54.760
 because now I know how to be prepared for trips,

03:54.760 --> 03:57.560
 but we lost our bags and I never got them back.

03:57.560 --> 03:58.680
 And like Alex said,

03:58.680 --> 04:00.560
 we didn't know where we'd be sleeping every night

04:00.560 --> 04:02.940
 and we're just driving through a new city

04:02.940 --> 04:06.000
 with a giant van in the most narrowest streets

04:06.000 --> 04:09.400
 and getting in many, many fights with Italian men.

04:09.400 --> 04:10.840
 So it wasn't really a vacation.

04:10.840 --> 04:13.000
 I saw this motion so many times.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.540
 Wasn't it liberating to lose your baggage?

04:16.540 --> 04:17.720
 Is it still the lining?

04:17.720 --> 04:19.000
 It was liberating.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.760
 My entire life, I've always had the issue of overpacking.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.360
 And I told her before the trip,

04:23.360 --> 04:25.160
 Andrea, you're gonna pack light, right?

04:25.160 --> 04:26.000
 Yeah, Alex, yeah.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.280
 And then I see her stuffing her overweight suitcase.

04:28.280 --> 04:29.280
 But you did the same.

04:29.280 --> 04:33.440
 We both had giant, big extra baggage that we didn't need.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.520
 And I'm actually very glad we lost it

04:35.520 --> 04:38.520
 because for Venice, hauling that around on all the boats

04:38.520 --> 04:41.120
 and through the tiny streets and there's no Ubers.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.440
 And now it's the first time where I can travel

04:43.440 --> 04:46.440
 without checking in a bag, which I've never done before.

04:46.440 --> 04:48.000
 So now I've learned what it means to pack light

04:48.000 --> 04:50.880
 because I saw that I could survive off of just my,

04:50.880 --> 04:51.960
 this sounds very dramatic,

04:51.960 --> 04:54.340
 but it was really a big learning lesson for me.

04:54.340 --> 04:55.720
 The driving must've been crazy

04:55.720 --> 04:57.880
 because driving in Italy is rough.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.520
 The driving was crazy.

04:59.520 --> 05:03.800
 I did most of it and it would be really interesting

05:03.800 --> 05:06.160
 driving through places like Florence

05:06.160 --> 05:10.080
 or even through the beach areas that were super windy

05:10.080 --> 05:11.520
 because there are two way streets

05:11.520 --> 05:13.240
 that should really only be one way.

05:13.240 --> 05:15.120
 So you'd be driving this huge van

05:15.120 --> 05:17.400
 and then another car comes on a cliff

05:17.400 --> 05:19.480
 and you're just waiting for it to slowly pass.

05:19.480 --> 05:22.980
 So it took all of my focus and concentration

05:22.980 --> 05:24.400
 to drive well in Italy,

05:24.400 --> 05:26.000
 but it was actually really relaxing

05:26.000 --> 05:30.400
 because the hardest thing about making a lot of videos online

05:30.400 --> 05:33.400
 is you're always thinking about it, what's coming next.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.840
 And when we were in Italy,

05:34.840 --> 05:37.480
 it was so chaotic that I did not think about work

05:37.480 --> 05:39.260
 for a good week and a bit.

05:39.260 --> 05:40.440
 Oh, cause you're just.

05:40.440 --> 05:41.280
 We were stressed.

05:41.280 --> 05:42.760
 I was just trying to keep us alive.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.560
 It seemed higher priority.

05:44.560 --> 05:45.640
 And that was kind of fun.

05:45.640 --> 05:46.840
 It was kind of fun.

05:46.840 --> 05:48.240
 No planning, nothing.

05:48.240 --> 05:49.080
 Just on a whim.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.400
 I wouldn't recommend it or ever do that again, but.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.440
 It sounds pretty awesome.

05:54.440 --> 05:57.100
 And we even randomly ran into two friends of ours

05:57.100 --> 05:58.240
 who were in the same city

05:58.240 --> 06:01.080
 and we just traveled with them for about half of the trip.

06:01.080 --> 06:03.280
 Yeah, so you just took on the chaos.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.960
 Exactly, it was an adventure.

06:04.960 --> 06:05.800
 Okay, and I see like,

06:05.800 --> 06:07.040
 cause you were using your hands a lot.

06:07.040 --> 06:10.840
 You picked up some of the Italian hand gestures.

06:10.840 --> 06:11.720
 I did.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.120
 We did get yelled at by a lot of Italians.

06:14.120 --> 06:17.400
 The old Italian grandmas would come to us after breakfast

06:17.400 --> 06:18.920
 cause we'd leave something on the plate

06:18.920 --> 06:19.760
 and she'd be like,

06:19.760 --> 06:21.760
 you could feed an entire village with that.

06:21.760 --> 06:22.680
 Tell your friends.

06:22.680 --> 06:24.320
 And we'd feel so ashamed.

06:24.320 --> 06:25.840
 Yeah, we got cursed out a lot,

06:25.840 --> 06:29.000
 but it really reminded me of where we grew up and helped.

06:29.000 --> 06:29.840
 That's true.

06:29.840 --> 06:30.680
 Yeah, bring back those mechanisms.

06:30.680 --> 06:32.360
 Where'd you grow up?

06:32.360 --> 06:33.640
 We're Romanian,

06:33.640 --> 06:35.360
 but it was like an immigrant neighborhood.

06:35.360 --> 06:36.360
 In Canada.

06:36.360 --> 06:39.280
 So, same if you don't finish your plate,

06:39.280 --> 06:42.000
 that's disrespectful to the people who made the food.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.600
 How was the food in Italy?

06:43.600 --> 06:46.000
 I feel like the carbs thing is too intense.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.280
 Yeah, I think very overrated in my opinion.

06:48.280 --> 06:51.040
 So I'm actually not supposed to eat gluten

06:51.040 --> 06:52.640
 cause I have an allergy,

06:52.640 --> 06:56.240
 but I was in Italy and it's gluten galore.

06:56.240 --> 06:57.800
 So I was actually eating a lot of it

06:57.800 --> 06:58.800
 and it was very interesting

06:58.800 --> 07:00.800
 cause I didn't get sick while I was in Italy,

07:00.800 --> 07:03.040
 but I do while I'm in the US.

07:03.040 --> 07:08.040
 So somehow the food was actually maybe more okay

07:08.040 --> 07:09.720
 for me to digest, which I appreciated,

07:09.720 --> 07:11.640
 but I didn't like it as much as I thought.

07:11.640 --> 07:12.760
 Did you like the food there?

07:12.760 --> 07:16.960
 Yeah, no, I did, I did.

07:16.960 --> 07:21.560
 I love carbs, but it feels like Vegas

07:21.560 --> 07:24.760
 when I go there for the food is like,

07:24.760 --> 07:28.360
 if I stay here too long, I'm gonna do things I regret.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.120
 That's what it feels like with the food.

07:30.120 --> 07:31.120
 I don't know how to moderate

07:31.120 --> 07:33.840
 and everybody is pushing very large portions

07:33.840 --> 07:36.960
 and while kind of eating things on you,

07:36.960 --> 07:41.640
 pasta, pizza and bread, so delicious.

07:41.640 --> 07:45.440
 So yeah, I love it, but I regret everything.

07:45.440 --> 07:47.800
 So it's like, I don't wanna go to a place

07:47.800 --> 07:51.440
 where I'm going to regret everything I do

07:51.440 --> 07:54.400
 for too long of a time.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.200
 Yeah, surprisingly the people there though

07:56.200 --> 07:59.040
 are still very fit and everyone stays in good shape,

07:59.040 --> 08:00.880
 but that's probably because you're walking around all day

08:00.880 --> 08:02.320
 and you're much more active than anyone.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.480
 And they also just know how to moderate food.

08:04.480 --> 08:07.280
 I think I've gotten used to the US way of eating.

08:07.280 --> 08:09.000
 The US portions. What is that?

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
 Just a lot, always a lot and more.

08:14.080 --> 08:17.560
 And I feel in the US food advertisements

08:17.560 --> 08:19.320
 are also much more in your face

08:19.320 --> 08:21.480
 and you're more often reminded of junk food

08:21.480 --> 08:22.880
 than we were in Italy.

08:22.880 --> 08:25.480
 So even though we were eating less healthy things,

08:25.480 --> 08:27.280
 I think we were getting cravings

08:27.280 --> 08:29.640
 and being pushed towards junk food less often.

08:30.840 --> 08:33.160
 All right, I gotta ask you a hard question.

08:33.160 --> 08:34.880
 So the romance languages.

08:34.880 --> 08:38.600
 So I think French is up there as like number one.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.360
 Number one in terms of?

08:40.360 --> 08:41.200
 I don't know.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.600
 Who's ranking them?

08:42.600 --> 08:45.320
 Oh, you guys speak Italian or no?

08:45.320 --> 08:49.240
 Not Italian, but we studied French and Spanish in school.

08:49.240 --> 08:50.120
 And Romanian.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.320
 I feel like every country calls their language

08:52.320 --> 08:53.160
 a romance language.

08:53.160 --> 08:58.160
 But it's Romanian, French, Spanish, Portuguese.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.960
 And I think there was one more that was like this dialect,

09:00.960 --> 09:03.400
 but those are considered the romance languages.

09:03.400 --> 09:05.480
 Okay, so where would you put Italian?

09:05.480 --> 09:08.280
 I think we got yelled at so much in Italian

09:08.280 --> 09:10.720
 that it's not gonna be a love word.

09:10.720 --> 09:11.600
 So it wasn't working.

09:11.600 --> 09:12.960
 It's on the bottom of the list

09:12.960 --> 09:15.000
 cause people did not use it nicely to us.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.240
 But I always really liked how French sounds.

09:19.800 --> 09:23.000
 I think something about it where maybe Spanish

09:23.000 --> 09:24.920
 actually sounds nicer to the ears,

09:24.920 --> 09:27.960
 but French has more character and it feels more sultry.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.000
 So I like French.

09:29.000 --> 09:29.840
 What about you?

09:29.840 --> 09:30.680
 Yeah, that was my answer too.

09:30.680 --> 09:31.500
 Oh.

09:31.500 --> 09:32.400
 Sultry, okay.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.960
 Yeah.

09:33.960 --> 09:36.960
 I feel like French, in France,

09:36.960 --> 09:39.240
 I feel like I'm always being judged.

09:39.240 --> 09:40.640
 Like they're better than me.

09:40.640 --> 09:41.480
 That's what French.

09:41.480 --> 09:42.320
 They are better than us.

09:42.320 --> 09:43.760
 That's true.

09:43.760 --> 09:44.720
 It's just so true.

09:45.680 --> 09:50.320
 Which is why I long to belong to that.

09:50.320 --> 09:51.840
 I like the British accent.

09:51.840 --> 09:52.680
 The British accent?

09:52.680 --> 09:53.520
 Yeah.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.880
 Actually, one thing we did on our Italian trip

09:55.880 --> 09:58.320
 is we just picked up British accents

09:58.320 --> 10:00.520
 for the entire trip for fun.

10:00.520 --> 10:02.000
 And we forgot we were doing them

10:02.000 --> 10:03.840
 to the point where we talked to British people

10:03.840 --> 10:05.880
 and they'd ask us, why are you talking like that?

10:05.880 --> 10:07.360
 We just couldn't stop.

10:07.360 --> 10:10.440
 I did feel much more elegant and mature.

10:10.440 --> 10:11.280
 That's true.

10:11.280 --> 10:13.560
 People like, I don't know if they felt the same way

10:13.560 --> 10:16.600
 about us, but it was more of the confidence.

10:16.600 --> 10:19.400
 You do feel like you're more poised for sure.

10:19.400 --> 10:20.280
 Yeah.

10:20.280 --> 10:22.320
 So how'd you guys get into chess?

10:22.320 --> 10:24.520
 When did you first, let's say,

10:24.520 --> 10:26.560
 when did you first fall in love with chess?

10:28.280 --> 10:31.000
 So we both started playing when we were pretty young,

10:31.000 --> 10:32.120
 around six years old.

10:32.120 --> 10:33.840
 That's when our dad taught us.

10:33.840 --> 10:36.200
 And I enjoyed playing chess

10:36.200 --> 10:38.720
 because I had good results early on,

10:38.720 --> 10:42.000
 but a lot of it was being pushed from my dad to play chess.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.320
 And I only really started loving it

10:44.320 --> 10:47.320
 when we moved from Canada and we started moving a lot

10:47.320 --> 10:50.400
 and chess was the one stable thing that I had.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.760
 And it was also where all of my friends were.

10:53.760 --> 10:57.480
 So it was kind of that foundational thing for me.

10:57.480 --> 10:59.640
 And that's when I started studying chess very intensely.

10:59.640 --> 11:02.200
 And when I started putting in the hours out of my own will

11:02.200 --> 11:04.000
 and not because I was being pushed by my dad,

11:04.000 --> 11:05.680
 that's when I started really loving it.

11:05.680 --> 11:07.560
 And I even wanted to take time off college

11:07.560 --> 11:09.360
 to just focus on chess.

11:09.360 --> 11:11.440
 So training and competing?

11:11.440 --> 11:12.920
 Training and competing, yeah.

11:12.920 --> 11:15.080
 It was when I was doing it for myself

11:15.080 --> 11:17.440
 that I started getting my best results.

11:17.440 --> 11:19.520
 And actually enjoying the thing.

11:19.520 --> 11:21.200
 And really enjoying it, yeah.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.920
 I would spend summer vacations studying for tournaments

11:23.920 --> 11:25.440
 and my mom would come and say,

11:25.440 --> 11:27.760
 "'You need to make friends, go leave the house."

11:27.760 --> 11:29.880
 And I'd be like, no, I need to play chess.

11:29.880 --> 11:31.800
 And I remember those moments.

11:31.800 --> 11:34.360
 That you rebelled by playing chess, that's awesome.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.320
 Yeah, exactly.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.560
 How did you get into it?

11:36.560 --> 11:39.680
 Yeah, my experience with loving in high school

11:39.680 --> 11:42.120
 is very opposite from Alex's, but right,

11:42.120 --> 11:44.000
 my sister was playing and my dad taught me

11:44.000 --> 11:45.120
 when I was also six. Andrea was cool

11:45.120 --> 11:46.360
 in high school, unlike me.

11:46.360 --> 11:47.200
 You were.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.840
 I wouldn't say cool, I'd say more balanced

11:49.840 --> 11:51.800
 and I was interested in other hobbies.

11:51.800 --> 11:54.760
 In my childhood, if I ever really did love chess,

11:54.760 --> 11:56.880
 there's certainly moments about traveling

11:56.880 --> 11:58.320
 and being together with my family

11:58.320 --> 11:59.680
 and spending those moments together,

11:59.680 --> 12:02.720
 but those are more the social and the experiences.

12:02.720 --> 12:05.440
 But funny enough, I think my happiest moment

12:05.440 --> 12:08.040
 where I really played the game for my own enjoyment

12:08.040 --> 12:11.480
 was probably my most recent tournament.

12:11.480 --> 12:15.040
 Because this was after, obviously, we've been streaming

12:15.040 --> 12:16.040
 and I'm no longer in high school,

12:16.040 --> 12:20.040
 but when I was in school, I was always playing for college

12:20.040 --> 12:22.200
 and for the results, trying to build a resume.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.040
 So I was too stressed out about the pressure

12:24.040 --> 12:25.360
 to really enjoy the game.

12:25.360 --> 12:27.360
 Whereas when I just played my first tournament,

12:27.360 --> 12:31.720
 so it was after a two year break because of the pandemic

12:31.720 --> 12:33.440
 and it was also all live on Twitch,

12:33.440 --> 12:36.960
 so there was some pressure, but it was the first time

12:36.960 --> 12:39.880
 that I was really eager to study for the game,

12:39.880 --> 12:42.120
 sitting and focusing since we've been streaming

12:42.120 --> 12:44.360
 and not getting distracted by something else.

12:44.360 --> 12:46.160
 In years, like I said.

12:46.160 --> 12:48.520
 And the tournament experience, I hit my highest rating

12:48.520 --> 12:50.280
 and it was my best tournament ever.

12:50.280 --> 12:51.880
 And I think most of that is because it came

12:51.880 --> 12:53.040
 from my own enjoyment.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.520
 So you didn't enjoy the domination?

12:56.520 --> 12:58.680
 Because I think you did really well, right?

12:58.680 --> 13:00.400
 This is like a couple months ago?

13:00.400 --> 13:01.400
 Oh yeah, yeah, the tournament.

13:01.400 --> 13:03.440
 Well, of course, I think the results came

13:03.440 --> 13:04.920
 from enjoying the tournament.

13:04.920 --> 13:08.320
 Because I would be in high school studying triple

13:08.320 --> 13:09.800
 the amount of time, like six hours every day

13:09.800 --> 13:12.040
 compared to this tournament, I didn't even prepare for it.

13:12.040 --> 13:13.720
 And for three years, I wouldn't be able

13:13.720 --> 13:16.200
 to pass one rating, whereas in this one tournament,

13:16.200 --> 13:19.720
 I passed it by like 70 points without even any preparation.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.440
 So it was, I think, as soon as you stopped worrying

13:22.440 --> 13:24.920
 about the competitions, when the games get much better.

13:24.920 --> 13:26.520
 What does it mean to pass a rating?

13:26.520 --> 13:28.320
 So I was stuck at 1900.

13:28.320 --> 13:31.120
 1900 is 100 points off of expert.

13:31.120 --> 13:32.000
 Yeah.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.800
 Usually when you reach 2000, you're considered an expert,

13:34.800 --> 13:36.760
 which is the rating Andrea was going for.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.240
 Okay, expert, that's a technical term

13:39.240 --> 13:40.880
 or that's like a talk and trash term?

13:40.880 --> 13:42.520
 It's more of a colloquial term

13:42.520 --> 13:44.280
 where if somebody is around a 2000

13:44.280 --> 13:45.560
 and you're playing them in a tournament,

13:45.560 --> 13:47.640
 they won't have the actual title next to their name,

13:47.640 --> 13:49.440
 but you always say, I'm playing an expert.

13:49.440 --> 13:52.440
 What about like the more official things like master?

13:52.440 --> 13:53.880
 Does that have to do with the rating or something else?

13:53.880 --> 13:57.880
 Yeah, so national master in the US is when you're 2200.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.800
 Okay, and what's international master?

13:59.800 --> 14:02.640
 International master is based off of a different system,

14:02.640 --> 14:04.960
 the FIDE system, which is international.

14:04.960 --> 14:09.400
 To be an international master, it's 2400

14:09.400 --> 14:12.480
 and you have to have three international master norms.

14:12.480 --> 14:16.520
 Yeah, I think Magnus said he's a 28, six something.

14:16.520 --> 14:17.360
 That was, yeah.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.600
 And then he said, that's pretty decent.

14:19.600 --> 14:20.440
 Now.

14:20.440 --> 14:21.280
 Well, he always talks a lot about that.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.440
 But see the thing is, I think what he meant

14:23.440 --> 14:25.720
 is that's a decent rating

14:25.720 --> 14:29.040
 because it accurately captures his actual level.

14:29.040 --> 14:32.960
 So it's not overinflated or underinflated and so on.

14:32.960 --> 14:35.800
 And so the discussion there was how do you get to,

14:35.800 --> 14:38.360
 can a human being get to 2900?

14:38.360 --> 14:40.360
 And then he says, because my current rating

14:40.360 --> 14:43.560
 is pretty decent at representing my skill level,

14:43.560 --> 14:46.280
 it's gonna be a long road to actually get there.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.440
 Because it's like, so you have to beat people

14:48.440 --> 14:50.560
 at your same level, that's how the number increases.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.280
 Exactly, yeah.

14:52.280 --> 14:54.480
 And you beat a bunch of people in the tournament, right?

14:54.480 --> 14:55.320
 That are higher than your luck.

14:55.320 --> 14:56.600
 I did, I got very lucky.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.080
 I was playing, I was really nervous

14:58.080 --> 15:01.680
 because my category was like 200 points above my rating.

15:01.680 --> 15:04.080
 And of course, I was very rusty

15:04.080 --> 15:05.520
 and I didn't play in a tournament in a while,

15:05.520 --> 15:07.720
 but it went pretty well.

15:07.720 --> 15:10.360
 Do you feel the pressure when you're actually recording it,

15:10.360 --> 15:11.600
 like the streaming?

15:11.600 --> 15:15.640
 It was definitely, so before every round I was vlogging

15:15.640 --> 15:17.240
 and I was doing meet and greets

15:17.240 --> 15:18.920
 and doing other things for the livestream.

15:18.920 --> 15:21.040
 Yeah, I saw you do a meet and greet.

15:21.040 --> 15:23.320
 You didn't know what the hell you were doing, it's great.

15:23.320 --> 15:24.160
 Yeah, yeah.

15:24.160 --> 15:25.240
 Like what am I, how do I do this?

15:25.240 --> 15:26.480
 Yeah, I see.

15:26.480 --> 15:27.520
 What do I do?

15:27.520 --> 15:29.120
 It was actually really wholesome.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.880
 The beginning was very silly

15:31.880 --> 15:33.600
 because I was just not expecting

15:33.600 --> 15:35.240
 that it was gonna be more of a seminar.

15:35.240 --> 15:37.560
 I thought it was like, oh, you pose and take pictures,

15:37.560 --> 15:39.480
 but they actually asked really nice, meaningful questions,

15:39.480 --> 15:41.520
 but unfortunately it's bad for YouTube retention

15:41.520 --> 15:43.520
 and we cut them all out, so.

15:43.520 --> 15:44.360
 Bad for YouTube?

15:44.360 --> 15:45.200
 Yeah.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.720
 The good long form conversation.

15:46.720 --> 15:47.560
 Yes.

15:47.560 --> 15:48.400
 So it was like questions, Q and A type of thing.

15:48.400 --> 15:51.440
 Exactly, you have to have very fast paced for YouTube

15:51.440 --> 15:54.120
 and that seminar was not fast paced.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.800
 Okay, well, not everything in life

15:55.800 --> 15:57.120
 needs to be on YouTube, right?

15:57.120 --> 15:57.960
 That's true.

15:57.960 --> 15:58.960
 There's like two parallel things,

15:58.960 --> 16:00.400
 stuff that's fun for YouTube.

16:00.400 --> 16:03.360
 Yes, one day we'll post that Q and A.

16:03.360 --> 16:06.440
 Yeah, when you guys like, when you become like ultra famous,

16:06.440 --> 16:08.200
 you're currently just regular famous.

16:08.200 --> 16:12.640
 And then they'll appreciate the long, slow content, yes.

16:12.640 --> 16:15.440
 And that, the YouTube aspect, the creation aspect,

16:15.440 --> 16:17.920
 does that add to the fun, ultimately,

16:17.920 --> 16:20.160
 of the chess, of like your love of chess?

16:20.160 --> 16:21.640
 Oh, for the love of chess in general

16:21.640 --> 16:24.320
 or just for competing in that one tournament?

16:24.320 --> 16:25.400
 No, love of chess in general.

16:25.400 --> 16:28.080
 I think you said that for competing for that tournament

16:28.080 --> 16:29.000
 is adding pressure.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.640
 Yeah, but actually I would say like a good pressure,

16:31.640 --> 16:34.000
 but yeah, this is where I differed to Alex

16:34.000 --> 16:37.880
 because when I was just competitive and I was younger,

16:37.880 --> 16:39.360
 I don't think I loved chess as much

16:39.360 --> 16:41.080
 as when I started doing it for content

16:41.080 --> 16:43.560
 because unlike her, who a lot of her friends

16:43.560 --> 16:46.320
 and social circle were other chess players,

16:46.320 --> 16:47.400
 I never really traveled

16:47.400 --> 16:50.080
 and built really solid friendships through chess

16:50.080 --> 16:52.880
 until I started streaming and meeting other chess streamers

16:52.880 --> 16:55.960
 and actually playing and talking to people for fun

16:55.960 --> 16:58.240
 rather than just always being alone in the game

16:58.240 --> 17:00.560
 and never really meeting other people my age

17:00.560 --> 17:02.160
 or people with similar interests.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.240
 So I would say Twitch was the thing

17:04.240 --> 17:07.360
 that really changed how I approached the game.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.240
 I think with some YouTubers,

17:09.240 --> 17:11.440
 there's a pressure to be almost somebody else.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.320
 You create a persona and you're stuck in that persona.

17:14.320 --> 17:19.120
 I think I'm too much of a boomer

17:19.120 --> 17:20.640
 to know what the hell Twitch is anyway,

17:20.640 --> 17:23.840
 but it feels like when you're actually live streaming,

17:23.840 --> 17:26.160
 you can't help but be who you really are.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.880
 I think it's, oh, well, I think when you're live streaming

17:28.880 --> 17:31.320
 and I've talked to a lot of other streamers about this,

17:31.320 --> 17:33.320
 you kind of just over exaggerate

17:33.320 --> 17:34.880
 one side of your personality.

17:34.880 --> 17:37.680
 And of course, it's kind of like being like on all the time.

17:37.680 --> 17:39.320
 Like you're trying to be more entertaining

17:39.320 --> 17:44.000
 and sometimes you're being silly at moments or more,

17:44.000 --> 17:46.880
 you take what character traits like people know you for.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.760
 And for me, one is being like ADHD

17:48.760 --> 17:52.240
 and the younger sibling who's very energetic

17:52.240 --> 17:53.280
 and causes trouble,

17:53.280 --> 17:54.120
 even though sometimes it's a little switch.

17:54.120 --> 17:56.320
 Yeah, I'm sure you cause trouble just for the camera.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.160
 Yeah, right.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.040
 I think, yeah, I think,

17:59.040 --> 18:00.360
 and of course, once you're live streaming

18:00.360 --> 18:01.640
 for like four or five hours,

18:01.640 --> 18:04.040
 there's gonna be moments in the stream where it's more chill,

18:04.040 --> 18:07.160
 but especially when you're like editing that content

18:07.160 --> 18:10.840
 or you're doing bigger streams that are shorter,

18:10.840 --> 18:13.160
 you are kind of playing up a side of yourself

18:13.160 --> 18:15.160
 because of course, there's a lot of parts of me

18:15.160 --> 18:16.400
 that I don't show to the camera

18:16.400 --> 18:18.160
 because they're not as entertaining to watch,

18:18.160 --> 18:19.760
 like the more serious part.

18:19.760 --> 18:23.440
 And also there's things that you are really interested in

18:23.440 --> 18:24.520
 about what you do.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.480
 Like I love competitive chess

18:26.480 --> 18:28.080
 where I could sit and really think about it,

18:28.080 --> 18:30.200
 but I know that that is not gonna be as entertaining

18:30.200 --> 18:31.040
 for stream.

18:31.040 --> 18:33.200
 I know that's not gonna be as entertaining for YouTube.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.520
 So you kind of have to take what you like,

18:35.520 --> 18:38.480
 but then really adapt it for whatever the format is.

18:38.480 --> 18:41.800
 And sometimes that feels inauthentic,

18:41.800 --> 18:44.520
 but other times it just feels like repackaging

18:44.520 --> 18:47.320
 what you love for people

18:47.320 --> 18:49.080
 in a more general audience to enjoy.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.920
 Do you feel like it's a trap a little bit as you evolve?

18:51.920 --> 18:53.200
 Like you're trapped in?

18:53.200 --> 18:56.360
 Oh, I think social media, oh, sorry, go ahead.

18:56.360 --> 18:59.640
 Social media in general is a trap of that kind?

18:59.640 --> 19:01.360
 Well, so we've been trying to switch

19:01.360 --> 19:03.760
 to learn how to make YouTube videos recently.

19:03.760 --> 19:07.360
 And so much of learning YouTube school

19:07.360 --> 19:09.560
 is kind of the beastification of content

19:09.560 --> 19:12.520
 where you try to get to the point of the video

19:12.520 --> 19:15.400
 within like the first 10 seconds to not lose people.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.160
 The beastificate, you mean like Mr. Beast?

19:17.160 --> 19:18.000
 Yeah. Okay.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.280
 Yeah, where it's so fast paced,

19:19.280 --> 19:21.680
 there's a reason to wait, there's high stakes.

19:21.680 --> 19:24.400
 And everything is created to keep people watching the video

19:24.400 --> 19:25.880
 and keep people on the platform.

19:25.880 --> 19:28.280
 And in some ways it is a trap

19:28.280 --> 19:32.360
 because it's harder to do the kind of content you like

19:32.360 --> 19:34.120
 because you really have to squeeze it to be like,

19:34.120 --> 19:36.440
 okay, well, do we have a good thumbnail for this?

19:36.440 --> 19:38.600
 Do we have a good title for this?

19:38.600 --> 19:41.040
 And that's something that we're trying to figure out

19:41.040 --> 19:45.800
 how to keep true to what we wanna do.

19:45.800 --> 19:47.440
 Yeah, see, the way I think about it is,

19:47.440 --> 19:49.360
 yeah, there's a lot of stuff you can create

19:49.360 --> 19:52.600
 and yeah, the Mr. Beastification process.

19:53.480 --> 19:57.160
 But also I think about what are the videos,

19:57.160 --> 20:01.120
 conversations or things I will create in this life

20:01.120 --> 20:04.000
 that will be the best thing I do.

20:04.960 --> 20:08.680
 And I try not to do things in my life

20:08.680 --> 20:10.800
 that will prevent me from getting there.

20:10.800 --> 20:14.880
 I feel like if you're always focusing on doing kind of,

20:14.880 --> 20:17.600
 optimizing the thumbnail in the 10 seconds and so on,

20:17.600 --> 20:21.400
 you'll never do the thing that's truly you're known for

20:21.400 --> 20:22.680
 and remembered for.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.080
 So finding that balance is tricky.

20:25.080 --> 20:27.240
 I get that, but at the same time,

20:27.240 --> 20:28.640
 this might be my own copium,

20:28.640 --> 20:31.200
 which I know is a word you know now.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.600
 Yeah, I'm slowly learning the full complexity

20:33.600 --> 20:35.080
 of the term, yes.

20:35.080 --> 20:38.680
 But the other way I think about it is,

20:38.680 --> 20:42.640
 it is a skill to learn how to communicate

20:42.640 --> 20:44.640
 with large audiences.

20:44.640 --> 20:47.240
 And first I started streaming chess,

20:47.240 --> 20:49.480
 which is something I just did and really loved,

20:49.480 --> 20:52.440
 but now I have to learn how to translate that format.

20:52.440 --> 20:54.240
 And if that's a skillset we could build,

20:54.240 --> 20:57.080
 then we could use it to do really important things.

20:57.080 --> 20:58.720
 And I've seen a lot of YouTubers

20:58.720 --> 21:01.120
 who have done interviews about how,

21:01.120 --> 21:03.640
 they didn't love the kind of content they did at first,

21:03.640 --> 21:06.040
 but what they're doing right now is really meaningful.

21:06.040 --> 21:08.720
 So I like to think of it, maybe like skill development,

21:08.720 --> 21:11.280
 cause not everybody hits off podcasts

21:11.280 --> 21:12.960
 where they can talk to super interesting people

21:12.960 --> 21:14.120
 right off the bat.

21:14.120 --> 21:17.240
 Yeah, you can be slow and boring in a podcast.

21:17.240 --> 21:19.280
 You don't have to worry about the first 10 seconds.

21:19.280 --> 21:21.200
 I mean, people like keep pushing me for,

21:21.200 --> 21:25.480
 cause the first 10 seconds of the videos I do is,

21:25.480 --> 21:27.080
 well, I know it's most important for YouTube,

21:27.080 --> 21:28.760
 but I don't give a damn.

21:28.760 --> 21:30.640
 I wrote a Chrome extension that hides

21:30.640 --> 21:32.120
 all the views and likes.

21:32.120 --> 21:34.840
 I don't look at the click through.

21:34.840 --> 21:37.040
 I don't look at Twitch views, Andrea does.

21:37.040 --> 21:39.160
 So we also can relate.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.400
 I love numbers too, but that's why I don't look at it.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.560
 Cause you become like, oh,

21:43.560 --> 21:45.680
 you'll start to think that a conversation

21:45.680 --> 21:48.800
 or I think you did sucks because it doesn't get views,

21:48.800 --> 21:50.760
 but that's just not the case.

21:50.760 --> 21:54.120
 YouTube algorithm is this monster that figures stuff out.

21:54.120 --> 21:56.440
 And if you let it control your mind,

21:56.440 --> 21:58.640
 I feel like it's going to destroy you creatively.

21:58.640 --> 22:01.040
 So you have to find a nice balance.

22:01.040 --> 22:02.920
 I have to say, I was laughing a little bit

22:02.920 --> 22:04.840
 when I was listening to the Magnus episode

22:04.840 --> 22:05.760
 and the first 10 minutes,

22:05.760 --> 22:08.200
 you guys are talking about soccer, football.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.920
 Two robots seem human in the conversation.

22:10.920 --> 22:11.920
 Yeah, exactly.

22:11.920 --> 22:14.480
 I was like, let's have some fun,

22:14.480 --> 22:17.680
 make conversation about non chess related topics.

22:17.680 --> 22:19.120
 Yeah, talk about sports.

22:19.120 --> 22:20.640
 Yeah, it was kind of hilarious.

22:20.640 --> 22:24.800
 I was surprised that even at his level,

22:24.800 --> 22:28.640
 I wasn't sure, but I was surprised how much he loves chess.

22:28.640 --> 22:29.880
 It sounds cliche to say,

22:29.880 --> 22:32.480
 but like the way he looked at a chess board,

22:32.480 --> 22:33.720
 you know those memes like,

22:33.720 --> 22:37.360
 I wish somebody looked at me the way he still like

22:37.360 --> 22:40.560
 the way he glanced down and he reached for the pieces

22:40.560 --> 22:42.120
 with excitement to show me something.

22:42.120 --> 22:45.960
 There was, there wasn't like, okay, I'll show you.

22:45.960 --> 22:49.240
 It was like, like there was still that fire.

22:49.240 --> 22:50.840
 That's something that always shocks me

22:50.840 --> 22:53.440
 about some of like super grandmasters.

22:53.440 --> 22:57.200
 Like one of my coaches was a person who also,

22:57.200 --> 22:58.520
 his name's GM Hammer of Norway.

22:58.520 --> 23:00.280
 He also coached Magnus.

23:00.280 --> 23:02.880
 He was his second and he was helping me train

23:02.880 --> 23:04.120
 for my tournament.

23:04.120 --> 23:06.480
 And I was kind of putting off doing the homework.

23:06.480 --> 23:07.600
 He's like, if you're putting it off,

23:07.600 --> 23:09.000
 that means you're studying the wrong thing.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.520
 Like you should be enjoying even when you're practicing,

23:11.520 --> 23:14.360
 which when I grew up, I thought to get to the top level,

23:14.360 --> 23:17.080
 like practicing has to be hard and unpleasant.

23:17.080 --> 23:19.080
 And when I was listening to Magnus episode,

23:19.080 --> 23:20.960
 he was like, I didn't read books very much.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.040
 Or there was one thing that you said

23:22.040 --> 23:25.240
 that's like very normal for studying classical chess

23:25.240 --> 23:27.400
 that he didn't do just because it didn't interest him.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.200
 He says, I suck at puzzles.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.160
 I don't like puzzles.

23:30.160 --> 23:32.320
 Yeah, and he doesn't do what he doesn't enjoy.

23:32.320 --> 23:35.640
 And that's because it's like purely driven out of passion.

23:35.640 --> 23:38.400
 I think the internet was like, I suck at puzzles too.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.240
 Yeah, they like that.

23:39.240 --> 23:41.600
 They're grandmasters.

23:41.600 --> 23:43.080
 I don't have to study at all.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.400
 It's just, it's fun.

23:44.400 --> 23:47.920
 And, but I think the lesson there that's really powerful

23:47.920 --> 23:50.000
 is he spends most of the day thinking about chess

23:50.000 --> 23:51.440
 because he wants to.

23:51.440 --> 23:54.200
 So do whatever, if you're into getting better at chess,

23:54.200 --> 23:57.720
 do whatever it takes to actually just the number of hours

23:57.720 --> 24:00.400
 you spend a day thinking about chess, maximize that.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.080
 If you're like super serious about it.

24:02.080 --> 24:03.800
 I actually get very addicted

24:03.800 --> 24:05.720
 whenever I start studying chess,

24:05.720 --> 24:08.120
 which is why I don't do it as seriously

24:08.120 --> 24:10.600
 when I'm focused on content.

24:10.600 --> 24:13.160
 Cause I go through these rabbit holes

24:13.160 --> 24:14.880
 where if I'm focusing on chess,

24:14.880 --> 24:17.560
 I wanna be as good as I possibly can at the game.

24:17.560 --> 24:19.320
 Otherwise it's hard for me to enjoy it

24:19.320 --> 24:21.280
 cause it's such a competitive thing.

24:21.280 --> 24:23.240
 And I remember training for tournaments

24:23.240 --> 24:25.120
 and when you're training for tournaments,

24:25.120 --> 24:27.480
 you even start dreaming about chess

24:27.480 --> 24:29.480
 and you can stop thinking about it.

24:29.480 --> 24:31.200
 And it's as if you're flipped

24:31.200 --> 24:33.360
 into this completely different world,

24:33.360 --> 24:35.240
 which is also what I like best about the game

24:35.240 --> 24:38.400
 that it's a completely different living experience.

24:38.400 --> 24:39.360
 And then you take some drugs

24:39.360 --> 24:41.520
 and now you start to see things on the ceiling.

24:41.520 --> 24:44.400
 Is there some factual hallucination

24:44.400 --> 24:48.680
 like to the Queen's Gambit, like those scenes?

24:48.680 --> 24:49.800
 I think it's...

24:49.800 --> 24:51.640
 Is that based on your life story?

24:51.640 --> 24:53.520
 Well, I can't say that on camera.

24:53.520 --> 24:55.000
 No, just kidding.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.360
 Actually chess players are very careful to not take drugs.

24:58.360 --> 25:00.520
 They drink a lot.

25:00.520 --> 25:01.480
 They drink so much.

25:01.480 --> 25:03.720
 It's actually crazy for how good they're able

25:03.720 --> 25:05.440
 to play chess when they do.

25:05.440 --> 25:07.800
 But when it comes to things like psychedelics

25:07.800 --> 25:10.240
 or other things, they usually stay away from those

25:10.240 --> 25:12.200
 cause they don't wanna mess anything up in their brain.

25:12.200 --> 25:13.920
 So this is actually intervention.

25:13.920 --> 25:17.040
 I saw that you mentioned somewhere,

25:17.040 --> 25:18.320
 I think it was the lie detector test

25:18.320 --> 25:20.040
 where you have a drinking problem.

25:20.040 --> 25:22.280
 Is that an actual...

25:22.280 --> 25:25.320
 I think that's actually a meme

25:25.320 --> 25:27.240
 that we like to joke about on stream

25:27.240 --> 25:29.920
 because occasionally we'd have like a white claw on stream

25:29.920 --> 25:31.000
 or something like that.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.200
 And then people meme about it.

25:32.200 --> 25:33.600
 It goes back to Andrea's point

25:33.600 --> 25:36.600
 of amplifying a part of your personality

25:36.600 --> 25:39.520
 to make yourself a little bit more entertaining.

25:39.520 --> 25:41.920
 I'm gonna use that as an excuse from now on.

25:41.920 --> 25:45.360
 This podcast is just amplifying a part of that personality.

25:45.360 --> 25:48.760
 I'm not really like this, but have you played drunk?

25:48.760 --> 25:50.640
 Like Magnus has played drunk.

25:50.640 --> 25:52.520
 He says it helps someone with the creativity.

25:52.520 --> 25:53.880
 Is there any truth to that?

25:53.880 --> 25:55.360
 Well, Andrea is under 21,

25:55.360 --> 25:59.080
 so she's obviously would never do that.

25:59.080 --> 26:01.200
 But I have played while drinking.

26:01.200 --> 26:05.520
 Actually, I enjoy playing chess and drinking

26:05.520 --> 26:08.840
 more than pre gaming or going out to a club and drinking,

26:08.840 --> 26:10.240
 which sounds really silly.

26:10.240 --> 26:11.800
 And I'll usually play against opponents

26:11.800 --> 26:14.040
 who are also having some beer.

26:14.040 --> 26:17.120
 And it does make you feel like you're seeing the game

26:17.120 --> 26:18.720
 from a fresher perspective

26:18.720 --> 26:22.200
 where it can sometimes make you feel more confident,

26:22.200 --> 26:24.840
 liquid confidence, and it does help with creativity.

26:24.840 --> 26:27.480
 You just feel like you could pull things off,

26:27.480 --> 26:28.440
 but there's also a limit.

26:28.440 --> 26:30.440
 It's more like you've had one drink or two drink,

26:30.440 --> 26:31.840
 but then it goes beyond that.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.560
 And then you just start missing tactics

26:33.560 --> 26:34.560
 and it's not worth it.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.400
 Yeah, I think it only helps players

26:36.400 --> 26:38.040
 in very short time controls.

26:38.040 --> 26:40.640
 One time I was challenging this grandmaster on stream

26:40.640 --> 26:42.280
 and we were playing bullet chess,

26:42.280 --> 26:44.000
 which is one minute chess.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.520
 And I was giving him handicaps.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.360
 And I said, okay, you have to take four shots

26:47.360 --> 26:48.600
 before the next game.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.720
 And he just got like 10 times stronger

26:50.720 --> 26:52.440
 and transformed into like the Hulk

26:52.440 --> 26:55.240
 and destroyed me more than the last game.

26:55.240 --> 26:57.840
 But of course, if you're playing like a three hour game,

26:57.840 --> 26:58.680
 it's gonna get old.

26:58.680 --> 27:00.960
 But I think in short time controls, it's amazing.

27:00.960 --> 27:02.560
 Yeah, definitely has to be blitz.

27:02.560 --> 27:04.520
 It has to be where it's more intuition

27:04.520 --> 27:06.360
 rather than sitting and calculating.

27:06.360 --> 27:08.160
 This is probably like negatively affecting

27:08.160 --> 27:09.160
 your ability to calculate.

27:09.160 --> 27:10.440
 Absolutely, yeah.

27:10.440 --> 27:11.720
 How much when you guys play,

27:11.720 --> 27:12.760
 when you look at the chess board,

27:12.760 --> 27:14.120
 how much of it is calculation?

27:14.120 --> 27:17.520
 How much of it is intuition?

27:17.520 --> 27:21.520
 How much of it is memorized openings?

27:22.480 --> 27:25.680
 It really depends between short form chess.

27:25.680 --> 27:27.720
 So five minutes, three minutes, one minute

27:27.720 --> 27:29.040
 and classical chess.

27:29.040 --> 27:30.040
 What's your favorite to play?

27:30.040 --> 27:33.440
 I love playing blitz now because that's most of what I do.

27:33.440 --> 27:35.440
 And that's actually how I got into chess streaming

27:35.440 --> 27:37.240
 because I couldn't spend entire weekends

27:37.240 --> 27:38.400
 or weeks playing tournaments.

27:38.400 --> 27:40.960
 I would just, while I was in college, log on

27:40.960 --> 27:43.640
 and play these long blitz or bullet sessions.

27:43.640 --> 27:44.960
 And it's very fast.

27:44.960 --> 27:48.400
 So you don't have time to go calculate as deeply.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.640
 You basically have to calculate short lines pretty quickly.

27:51.640 --> 27:55.240
 And a lot of it is pattern recognition and intuition.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.320
 As three minutes, you said?

27:56.320 --> 27:57.520
 Three minutes, yeah.

27:57.520 --> 27:58.360
 Okay, cool.

27:58.360 --> 28:00.920
 And so for that, it's just basically intuition.

28:00.920 --> 28:02.760
 A lot of it is intuition, yeah.

28:02.760 --> 28:04.880
 See, I saw on streams you actually keep talking

28:04.880 --> 28:05.720
 while playing chess.

28:05.720 --> 28:06.560
 It seems really difficult.

28:06.560 --> 28:07.400
 Yeah, that helps my result.

28:07.400 --> 28:08.640
 That doesn't help my result.

28:08.640 --> 28:09.480
 It doesn't, it hurts.

28:09.480 --> 28:10.520
 It helps content, not the game.

28:10.520 --> 28:11.600
 Yeah, exactly.

28:11.600 --> 28:12.920
 But you can still do it.

28:12.920 --> 28:15.520
 Because it feels like how can you possibly concentrate

28:15.520 --> 28:17.040
 while talking?

28:17.040 --> 28:19.160
 It's because so much of it is intuition.

28:19.160 --> 28:20.760
 You're not, while you're talking,

28:20.760 --> 28:22.120
 you're thinking about that topic,

28:22.120 --> 28:23.360
 but then you just come to the board

28:23.360 --> 28:26.200
 and you just understand what you should be doing here.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.080
 And then sometimes you get in trouble

28:28.080 --> 28:29.840
 because you're talking and you have now lost

28:29.840 --> 28:30.680
 half of your time.

28:30.680 --> 28:32.520
 You have a minute and a half, your opponent has three,

28:32.520 --> 28:34.360
 and you're kind of at a disadvantage.

28:34.360 --> 28:36.840
 But that kind of goes to show

28:36.840 --> 28:38.680
 that that's how blitz chess usually works,

28:38.680 --> 28:40.200
 whereas classical is very different.

28:40.200 --> 28:41.840
 Which of you is better at chess?

28:41.840 --> 28:43.200
 I mean, let's do it this way.

28:43.200 --> 28:47.680
 Can you, Andrea, can you say what,

28:47.680 --> 28:49.840
 in which way is Alex stronger than you?

28:49.840 --> 28:51.680
 Which way is she weaker than you?

28:51.680 --> 28:54.800
 Not physically in terms of chess.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.240
 Well, yes, of course she is higher rated.

28:58.240 --> 29:01.800
 But when we do play, I think her strengths against me

29:01.800 --> 29:03.640
 where she really gets me is the end game.

29:03.640 --> 29:06.080
 She has stronger end game, so she can,

29:06.080 --> 29:08.280
 and I actually have a stronger opening,

29:08.280 --> 29:09.120
 but as soon as she's able to simplify.

29:09.120 --> 29:11.400
 Andrea, I'm supposed to say what is good about you,

29:11.400 --> 29:12.240
 not you.

29:12.240 --> 29:13.640
 You know, I'm getting there.

29:13.640 --> 29:14.840
 Well, see, this is what I'm saying,

29:14.840 --> 29:17.400
 because don't worry, it's related, okay?

29:17.400 --> 29:19.200
 Because if I can get an advantage

29:19.200 --> 29:20.200
 in the beginning of the game,

29:20.200 --> 29:22.160
 but as soon as she starts trading pieces down,

29:22.160 --> 29:23.440
 like my confidence drops,

29:23.440 --> 29:25.160
 because I know that the end game

29:25.160 --> 29:27.520
 is the hardest part of the game and the longest,

29:27.520 --> 29:29.240
 and that's where she ends up beating me.

29:29.240 --> 29:32.840
 So her end game is I think really what makes the difference.

29:32.840 --> 29:36.960
 It sounds like her psychological warfare is better too,

29:36.960 --> 29:39.040
 because if you're getting nervous.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.360
 But it's harder to play against higher rated players,

29:41.360 --> 29:44.920
 same how Magnus and former world champions

29:44.920 --> 29:46.560
 have that psychological edge.

29:46.560 --> 29:48.560
 So I think it's always going to be different for Andrea,

29:48.560 --> 29:50.360
 because she knows statistically

29:50.360 --> 29:52.920
 she should be winning something like one in four games,

29:52.920 --> 29:55.120
 but she usually does better than that,

29:55.120 --> 29:58.000
 because she's very distracting and talks a lot.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.080
 That does help.

29:59.080 --> 30:01.920
 What does it feel like to play a higher rated player?

30:01.920 --> 30:03.720
 What's the experience of that?

30:06.760 --> 30:08.800
 Playing somebody like Magnus.

30:08.800 --> 30:11.880
 So it depends on how much higher rated than you they are.

30:11.880 --> 30:13.760
 If it's someone who's like between me and Andrea,

30:13.760 --> 30:16.200
 let's say it's a 200 point difference,

30:16.200 --> 30:17.240
 you know they should win,

30:17.240 --> 30:19.680
 but at least you still feel like you have a chance.

30:19.680 --> 30:21.840
 I was playing in a title Tuesday,

30:21.840 --> 30:24.480
 which is this tournament chess.com has every Tuesday.

30:24.480 --> 30:26.760
 And I got really lucky, beat a GM,

30:26.760 --> 30:27.880
 drew an international master,

30:27.880 --> 30:30.480
 and then I got paired against Hikaru Nakamura.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.440
 And my brain just went blank,

30:32.440 --> 30:35.200
 because I just know that I'm so unlikely to win

30:35.200 --> 30:37.520
 that I couldn't even play the game properly

30:37.520 --> 30:39.000
 when it's that much of a difference

30:39.000 --> 30:41.560
 where they should be winning like 99% of the time.

30:42.480 --> 30:43.800
 But that's like psychological.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.520
 So you're saying that's the biggest experience

30:45.520 --> 30:48.240
 is like actually knowing the numbers

30:48.240 --> 30:50.600
 and statistically thinking there's no way I can win.

30:50.600 --> 30:52.680
 But I meant like, is there a suffocating feeling

30:52.680 --> 30:54.840
 like positionally you feel like

30:54.840 --> 30:57.800
 you're constantly under attack?

30:57.800 --> 31:00.640
 You just feel like you're slowly getting outsmarted.

31:00.640 --> 31:02.640
 And the worst is when you don't even know

31:02.640 --> 31:03.800
 what you're doing wrong.

31:03.800 --> 31:05.560
 You come out of that and you're like,

31:05.560 --> 31:08.480
 I thought I was doing great and I got slowly squeezed.

31:08.480 --> 31:10.400
 I didn't understand what was going on.

31:10.400 --> 31:11.760
 And you're just kind of baffled.

31:11.760 --> 31:15.280
 It's kind of like watching AlphaZero beat up Stockfish.

31:15.280 --> 31:18.320
 And you don't really understand why it's making certain moves

31:18.320 --> 31:19.760
 or how it thought of the plan.

31:19.760 --> 31:22.600
 You just see it slowly getting the position better.

31:22.600 --> 31:24.280
 And that's what it feels like.

31:24.280 --> 31:26.960
 I would add it's kind of different for me

31:26.960 --> 31:29.240
 if they're someone who's significantly higher rated.

31:29.240 --> 31:31.000
 So let's say more than like 300 points

31:31.000 --> 31:32.720
 or you're playing Magnus.

31:32.720 --> 31:35.520
 What I notice is I just feel lost straight

31:35.520 --> 31:37.560
 as soon as I don't know my preparation

31:37.560 --> 31:39.360
 because they know so many opening lines

31:39.360 --> 31:41.280
 that they're gonna know the best line to beat you

31:41.280 --> 31:42.760
 that you haven't studied.

31:42.760 --> 31:44.120
 So then on move 10, you're like,

31:44.120 --> 31:47.360
 he already has a maybe plus 0.5 advantage

31:47.360 --> 31:48.600
 which is really small.

31:48.600 --> 31:51.720
 But for someone with such a significant skill level

31:51.720 --> 31:53.240
 you know you already lost at that point.

31:53.240 --> 31:57.200
 And it's like a third of the game.

31:57.200 --> 32:00.760
 What are the strengths and weaknesses of Andrea?

32:00.760 --> 32:04.480
 Andrea is very good at opening preparation.

32:04.480 --> 32:05.320
 As she said.

32:05.320 --> 32:07.720
 As she said, she likes bringing that up.

32:07.720 --> 32:09.320
 I mean, she's very meticulous about it

32:09.320 --> 32:13.640
 where she'll really go in and learn her lines.

32:13.640 --> 32:16.000
 And having that initial starting confidence

32:16.000 --> 32:17.600
 isn't just helpful for the opening

32:17.600 --> 32:20.280
 but it helps develop your plans for the middle game.

32:20.280 --> 32:23.280
 So I think she's very good at that.

32:23.280 --> 32:25.320
 I think she's actually pretty good

32:25.320 --> 32:27.840
 at tactical combinations.

32:28.720 --> 32:29.760
 What is tactics?

32:29.760 --> 32:33.560
 Tactics is like solving puzzles

32:33.560 --> 32:36.520
 or basically finding lines that are forced

32:36.520 --> 32:39.120
 where if you find them, you're going to win.

32:39.120 --> 32:41.720
 So that's like puzzles within a position.

32:41.720 --> 32:42.640
 Yeah, exactly.

32:42.640 --> 32:45.800
 Whereas strategic chess is making slow moves

32:45.800 --> 32:48.240
 and over the process of like 20 moves

32:48.240 --> 32:50.960
 you get a slightly better position based on

32:50.960 --> 32:54.000
 an understanding of the overall strategy.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
 So in my extensive research review on Wikipedia,

32:58.400 --> 33:00.560
 it says your most played opening

33:00.560 --> 33:02.880
 is the King's Indian defense.

33:02.880 --> 33:04.880
 In which, quote, black allows white

33:04.880 --> 33:07.560
 to advance their pawns to the center of the board

33:07.560 --> 33:09.320
 in the first two moves.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.200
 Is there any truth to this?

33:11.200 --> 33:12.680
 So the King's Indian.

33:12.680 --> 33:13.520
 And what is it?

33:13.520 --> 33:15.640
 Probably is my most played opening.

33:15.640 --> 33:19.080
 And it's one where even when my coach

33:19.080 --> 33:20.320
 who was a grandmaster taught me,

33:20.320 --> 33:21.320
 he was like, so you know,

33:21.320 --> 33:23.240
 I've been playing the King's Indian for 10 years

33:23.240 --> 33:25.200
 and I still don't understand it.

33:25.200 --> 33:27.400
 And it's one of those openings that computers

33:27.400 --> 33:29.600
 really don't like because you do,

33:29.600 --> 33:31.320
 or at least Stockfish doesn't like it.

33:31.320 --> 33:32.920
 Maybe AlphaZero would change their mind.

33:32.920 --> 33:34.400
 I forgot to look at what.

33:34.400 --> 33:35.880
 Can you show me, by the way, what it is?

33:35.880 --> 33:36.720
 Yeah.

33:36.720 --> 33:39.880
 Is it white's opening or black's opening?

33:39.880 --> 33:44.880
 Black responds to the D4 Queen's pawn push.

33:44.880 --> 33:46.720
 And you take your knight out to F6.

33:46.720 --> 33:50.280
 I'll just put in the stereotypical,

33:50.280 --> 33:52.960
 classical King's Indian more so to say.

33:54.600 --> 33:57.000
 We actually have a very famous King's Indian game

33:57.000 --> 33:58.640
 in the notes that we prepared.

33:58.640 --> 33:59.480
 Okay.

33:59.480 --> 34:02.960
 For the record, I asked you guys for some games

34:02.960 --> 34:04.280
 that you find pretty cool

34:04.280 --> 34:06.520
 and maybe to get a chance to talk about some.

34:06.520 --> 34:07.640
 Yeah.

34:07.640 --> 34:09.200
 So this is the King's Indian.

34:09.200 --> 34:13.560
 As you can see, white has much more control

34:13.560 --> 34:14.400
 over the center.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.520
 White has three pawns in the center

34:16.520 --> 34:19.400
 while black has none past the fifth rank.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.760
 And you just have this pawn on D6.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.520
 And one of the ideas in chess is

34:23.520 --> 34:24.960
 if you're not taking the center,

34:24.960 --> 34:26.960
 then your plan revolves around

34:26.960 --> 34:29.440
 trying to continually challenge it.

34:29.440 --> 34:33.000
 But what is really fun about the King's Indian

34:33.000 --> 34:37.880
 is that black sometimes gets these crazy King side attacks

34:37.880 --> 34:39.600
 while white gets Queen side attacks.

34:39.600 --> 34:43.080
 And even though it's a little bit suspicious for black

34:43.080 --> 34:45.560
 and the computer could usually break it,

34:45.560 --> 34:49.040
 it's hard to defend as a human when you're being attacked.

34:49.040 --> 34:51.480
 But if you don't pull off the attack as black,

34:51.480 --> 34:54.120
 then you're just gonna end up being lost in the end game.

34:54.120 --> 34:56.320
 So it's like a very asymmetrical position.

34:56.320 --> 34:57.720
 It's very asymmetrical,

34:57.720 --> 35:00.200
 although a lot of people now stop playing

35:00.200 --> 35:01.840
 into the classical King's Indian,

35:01.840 --> 35:04.600
 even though computers give it a big advantage.

35:04.600 --> 35:07.760
 And they play these slower lines in the King's Indian,

35:07.760 --> 35:09.480
 which are less fun to play.

35:09.480 --> 35:10.400
 What's slower mean?

35:10.400 --> 35:14.680
 It takes a longer time to do something interesting with?

35:15.680 --> 35:18.360
 They basically don't let you get as much

35:18.360 --> 35:19.680
 of a King side attack

35:19.680 --> 35:22.000
 because they try opening up the center

35:22.000 --> 35:23.800
 and then you have no weaknesses,

35:23.800 --> 35:27.000
 but you're just slowly improving the position of your pieces

35:27.000 --> 35:29.320
 instead of being able to go for that King side attack.

35:29.320 --> 35:30.600
 So for people just listening,

35:30.600 --> 35:34.840
 there is the white pawns are all on the fourth row

35:34.840 --> 35:35.840
 in a row together.

35:35.840 --> 35:37.520
 That feels like a bad position.

35:37.520 --> 35:38.360
 For black?

35:38.360 --> 35:39.480
 For white.

35:39.480 --> 35:41.320
 Oh, you don't like taking the center?

35:41.320 --> 35:43.400
 No, I like taking the center.

35:43.400 --> 35:44.920
 Now you're talking trash already.

35:44.920 --> 35:45.760
 Oh, sorry.

35:45.760 --> 35:49.440
 But it's just like they're like feel vulnerable

35:49.440 --> 35:50.680
 there in a row together.

35:50.680 --> 35:53.360
 Like it's like, you know,

35:53.360 --> 35:54.880
 cause they're like, who's gonna defend them?

35:54.880 --> 35:57.480
 I guess the Knights defend and the Queen defends it.

35:57.480 --> 35:59.440
 You're actually talking about a theme

35:59.440 --> 36:02.320
 that you do see sometimes, which is called hanging pawns.

36:02.320 --> 36:04.440
 And when you have two pawns right next to each other

36:04.440 --> 36:06.320
 with no other pawns to defend them.

36:06.320 --> 36:09.960
 Yeah, so it is a valid point.

36:09.960 --> 36:10.800
 And actually as black,

36:10.800 --> 36:12.320
 you're trying to break apart these pawns

36:12.320 --> 36:15.920
 or get them to push and create some holes into the position,

36:15.920 --> 36:17.640
 but it's a trade off.

36:17.640 --> 36:20.880
 And that's a lot of what chess openings are about.

36:20.880 --> 36:21.920
 You get more space,

36:21.920 --> 36:24.120
 but you'll also end up having to protect your pawns

36:24.120 --> 36:26.080
 potentially or move them forward to the point

36:26.080 --> 36:27.200
 where they're overextended.

36:27.200 --> 36:30.080
 And plus pawns being vulnerable, it's kind of fun.

36:30.080 --> 36:31.800
 It's like, there's more stuff in danger.

36:31.800 --> 36:34.520
 They're not, cause if it's like this,

36:34.520 --> 36:37.280
 everything's like trapped, like you can't do anything.

36:37.280 --> 36:38.360
 Everything's blocked, yeah.

36:38.360 --> 36:40.000
 And blocked off, yeah.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.920
 It's like you can't have fun.

36:41.920 --> 36:44.720
 Yeah, one of the most,

36:44.720 --> 36:46.120
 one of the opening principles for white

36:46.120 --> 36:47.520
 is get your pawns in the center.

36:47.520 --> 36:51.880
 So I'd say like this is actually preferable for white.

36:51.880 --> 36:53.440
 Let's go over some opening principles.

36:53.440 --> 36:54.280
 There we go.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.000
 Cause this is a very good learning lesson

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
 for any chess beginners in the audience.

37:01.880 --> 37:04.200
 Okay, so first thing you wanna do is control the center.

37:04.200 --> 37:07.200
 There we go, E4, the more aggressive one.

37:07.200 --> 37:09.760
 Isn't that like the basic vanilla move?

37:09.760 --> 37:12.320
 I didn't, somebody told me that's the most popular

37:12.320 --> 37:14.320
 opening move in chess.

37:14.320 --> 37:15.160
 It is.

37:15.160 --> 37:16.360
 Why is that considered aggressive?

37:16.360 --> 37:20.400
 So it's E4 and D4 and the king's pawn is known

37:20.400 --> 37:22.640
 as being for more tactical players,

37:22.640 --> 37:25.840
 whereas D4 is known for more positional players.

37:25.840 --> 37:28.400
 So that's why it's considered more aggressive.

37:28.400 --> 37:29.240
 Tactical.

37:29.240 --> 37:30.880
 More gambits with E4, I think.

37:30.880 --> 37:35.600
 So tactical means I'm gonna try to attack you.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.680
 You're gonna try to go for puzzles

37:37.680 --> 37:42.480
 and rely more on your combination abilities.

37:42.480 --> 37:44.560
 Whereas if it's something positional,

37:44.560 --> 37:46.840
 you usually have like three to four moves

37:46.840 --> 37:48.040
 that are all good in the position,

37:48.040 --> 37:50.760
 whereas tactics, you need to see this one line.

37:50.760 --> 37:52.280
 So it's more precise.

37:52.280 --> 37:54.960
 So this one's cool cause he can like,

37:54.960 --> 37:57.080
 the queen can come out, the bishop can come out.

37:57.080 --> 38:00.520
 Yeah, and that's one of the most popular checkmates

38:00.520 --> 38:02.320
 and usually what you teach new students

38:02.320 --> 38:03.760
 to try to cheese their friends

38:03.760 --> 38:04.960
 cause then they feel really excited

38:04.960 --> 38:06.120
 that they know this new trap

38:06.120 --> 38:07.960
 where you bring the bishop and the queen out

38:07.960 --> 38:09.600
 and you try to checkmate on F7.

38:09.600 --> 38:10.440
 Yeah.

38:10.440 --> 38:12.840
 It's the trap that queen's gambit, Beth Harmon,

38:12.840 --> 38:16.240
 falls for in their first game versus the janitor.

38:16.240 --> 38:18.680
 She gets all mad cause she gets checkmated very early.

38:18.680 --> 38:20.000
 Oh, that's the one she gets checkmated with?

38:20.000 --> 38:20.840
 Yeah.

38:20.840 --> 38:21.680
 Okay.

38:21.680 --> 38:23.080
 I love how you guys were actually paying attention

38:23.080 --> 38:25.240
 to the games carefully,

38:25.240 --> 38:26.840
 which is pretty cool that they did a good job

38:26.840 --> 38:29.920
 of improving, evolving her game throughout the show

38:29.920 --> 38:33.360
 to actually represent an actual growth of a chess player.

38:33.360 --> 38:34.200
 Yeah.

38:34.200 --> 38:37.520
 They really took every detail into consideration,

38:37.520 --> 38:38.440
 which was cool.

38:38.440 --> 38:39.280
 Okay.

38:39.280 --> 38:40.120
 So what else?

38:40.120 --> 38:41.960
 That's, I brought stuff into the center.

38:41.960 --> 38:42.800
 We'll do the same.

38:42.800 --> 38:43.640
 Okay.

38:43.640 --> 38:45.560
 So then you want to develop your pieces.

38:45.560 --> 38:46.720
 So in the beginning of the game,

38:46.720 --> 38:49.160
 you want to take out the bishops and knights first

38:49.160 --> 38:50.560
 because you don't want to start

38:50.560 --> 38:53.080
 with the most valuable piece like the queen

38:53.080 --> 38:54.880
 cause then it'll become a vulnerability

38:54.880 --> 38:57.120
 and it'll get attacked very early on.

38:57.120 --> 39:00.400
 And the reason you're taking out these two pieces first

39:00.400 --> 39:02.480
 is cause you want to castle your king.

39:02.480 --> 39:04.680
 So you can move a knight move or a bishop move

39:04.680 --> 39:06.720
 and that's considered developing.

39:06.720 --> 39:07.560
 Yeah.

39:07.560 --> 39:10.320
 So at this stage, not like even before

39:10.320 --> 39:11.960
 getting a few pawns out.

39:11.960 --> 39:14.920
 You usually want to start with getting a pawn

39:14.920 --> 39:16.960
 because you want to get space in the center,

39:16.960 --> 39:18.880
 but also when you push pawns,

39:18.880 --> 39:21.160
 it helps free up some of your pieces.

39:22.400 --> 39:24.800
 So usually start with one pawn first

39:24.800 --> 39:26.880
 and then you could start taking out your minor pieces,

39:26.880 --> 39:28.160
 which is the bishop and the knight.

39:28.160 --> 39:31.320
 I have anxiety about a pawn just floating out there.

39:31.320 --> 39:32.680
 Defenseless.

39:32.680 --> 39:34.440
 But it's not attacked yet.

39:34.440 --> 39:36.080
 See, those are what you call ghost threats.

39:36.080 --> 39:38.480
 So you're scared of something that hasn't happened yet.

39:38.480 --> 39:40.120
 So if I were to attack it.

39:40.120 --> 39:43.000
 Feel like there's a deeper thing going on here.

39:43.000 --> 39:43.840
 Yeah.

39:43.840 --> 39:44.680
 Actually, let's say.

39:44.680 --> 39:47.440
 Yeah, so you're attacking the pawn in the center here

39:47.440 --> 39:50.560
 and it is vulnerable, but as soon as you do that,

39:50.560 --> 39:53.720
 I can develop my own knight and defend it as well.

39:53.720 --> 39:54.560
 Okay.

39:54.560 --> 39:55.380
 And now for people just listening,

39:55.380 --> 39:58.600
 there's two pawns that just came out to meet each other

39:58.600 --> 40:00.160
 and a couple of knights.

40:00.160 --> 40:01.520
 You love the chess commentary.

40:01.520 --> 40:02.360
 It's very poetic.

40:02.360 --> 40:03.200
 Yeah.

40:03.200 --> 40:04.920
 The pawns met after midnight.

40:04.920 --> 40:06.000
 Yeah, yeah.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.400
 Well, I'm going to romanticize the game a bit.

40:08.400 --> 40:09.240
 Yes, exactly.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.080
 Okay, cool.

40:10.080 --> 40:14.280
 So like there's, if you bring out the bishops

40:14.280 --> 40:16.760
 with the knights, you're matching that with the other.

40:16.760 --> 40:18.200
 Black is going to match it.

40:18.200 --> 40:19.040
 Exactly.

40:19.040 --> 40:19.880
 Whatever you're attacking with.

40:19.880 --> 40:20.700
 Yep, he's developing.

40:20.700 --> 40:21.540
 It's going to defend it.

40:21.540 --> 40:23.440
 Now you could develop your bishop

40:23.440 --> 40:25.280
 or your knight, whatever you'd like.

40:25.280 --> 40:27.280
 Oh no, now you give him options.

40:27.280 --> 40:28.240
 All right.

40:28.240 --> 40:30.000
 Yeah, there you go.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.440
 Now I am attacking the pawn in the center,

40:32.440 --> 40:34.580
 which is what you were afraid about before,

40:34.580 --> 40:36.980
 but let's see how you defend it here.

40:41.560 --> 40:43.680
 By doing this symmetrical thing,

40:43.680 --> 40:45.680
 bringing out the knight on the other side.

40:45.680 --> 40:48.080
 And actually your other move was good as well,

40:48.080 --> 40:49.100
 defending with the pawn,

40:49.100 --> 40:51.880
 because then you're freeing up space for your bishop.

40:51.880 --> 40:54.520
 So you're basically trying to develop your pieces

40:54.520 --> 40:57.480
 as quickly as possible, put your pawns in the center,

40:57.480 --> 40:59.280
 and then get your king to safety.

40:59.280 --> 41:03.080
 And that's usually the basic opening tips that you get.

41:03.080 --> 41:05.060
 And it is kind of counterintuitive

41:05.060 --> 41:09.120
 that safety is in the corner of the board for a king.

41:09.120 --> 41:11.480
 That was always confusing to me, but you know.

41:11.480 --> 41:12.800
 Three pawns in front,

41:12.800 --> 41:15.360
 though you typically don't push those.

41:15.360 --> 41:17.720
 Maybe like one, maybe I'll go one square,

41:17.720 --> 41:21.080
 but these will be like the wall of defense

41:21.080 --> 41:22.080
 that keep him safe.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.080
 But another way to also think about it

41:24.080 --> 41:28.080
 is your pieces usually wanna point towards the center.

41:28.080 --> 41:29.860
 If you have a knight closer to the center

41:29.860 --> 41:31.420
 than closer to the side,

41:31.420 --> 41:34.080
 it actually has more squares it can go to.

41:34.080 --> 41:37.240
 So a huge part of it is just wanting to have flexibility

41:37.240 --> 41:38.640
 for where your pieces go.

41:38.640 --> 41:42.200
 So more pieces are going to be able to make threats

41:42.200 --> 41:45.200
 in the center or even open up the position.

41:45.200 --> 41:48.460
 So since that's where it's most likely to open,

41:48.460 --> 41:49.560
 you want your king somewhere

41:49.560 --> 41:51.240
 where the position will stay closed

41:51.240 --> 41:52.920
 so that you have the pawns to defend.

41:52.920 --> 41:54.680
 You know, there's like rules like this,

41:54.680 --> 41:55.800
 but I always wonder,

41:55.800 --> 41:57.560
 cause I've built chess engines,

41:57.560 --> 42:00.400
 but then you start to wonder like,

42:00.400 --> 42:03.360
 why is it that positionally these things are good?

42:03.360 --> 42:05.400
 Like you've built up an intuition about it,

42:05.400 --> 42:08.360
 but I wish, and that's the thing that would be amazing

42:08.360 --> 42:10.160
 if engines could explain,

42:10.160 --> 42:13.320
 why is this kind of thing better than this kind of thing?

42:13.320 --> 42:15.040
 You start to build up an intuition,

42:15.040 --> 42:17.960
 but if I'm just like knowing nothing about chess,

42:17.960 --> 42:21.280
 it feels confusing that cornering your king,

42:21.280 --> 42:25.160
 like getting him like trapped here.

42:25.160 --> 42:27.920
 Like it feels like you could get checkmated easier there

42:27.920 --> 42:30.920
 if I was just using like dumb intuition,

42:30.920 --> 42:33.380
 but it seems like that's not the case.

42:33.380 --> 42:36.460
 I imagine maybe, cause AlphaZero learned

42:36.460 --> 42:38.580
 by playing games against itself, right?

42:38.580 --> 42:40.840
 And I imagine if you have a lot of games

42:40.840 --> 42:42.360
 and you do build an intuition,

42:42.360 --> 42:44.160
 because if you were to keep your king in the center,

42:44.160 --> 42:45.400
 you just see that in those games,

42:45.400 --> 42:48.460
 you're dealing with threats a lot more often.

42:48.460 --> 42:50.320
 But yeah, there's shortcut rules

42:50.320 --> 42:53.120
 and this doesn't even mean it's the best way to play chess

42:53.120 --> 42:55.720
 as we've seen with AlphaZero

42:55.720 --> 42:58.040
 kind of changing the rules of the game a little bit.

42:58.040 --> 43:00.720
 But as a human, to learn it from scratch

43:00.720 --> 43:03.320
 is a lot more difficult than to start with principles.

43:03.320 --> 43:07.560
 So that's why beginners usually learn chess this way.

43:07.560 --> 43:09.960
 Yeah, because you're playing other humans

43:09.960 --> 43:11.960
 and the other humans have also operated

43:11.960 --> 43:13.000
 on a different principles.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.960
 And that's why people that come up now

43:15.960 --> 43:17.640
 that are training with engines

43:17.640 --> 43:20.400
 are just going to be much better

43:20.400 --> 43:21.520
 than the people of the past

43:21.520 --> 43:24.880
 because they're gonna try out weirder ideas

43:24.880 --> 43:27.000
 that go against the principles of old.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.020
 And they're gonna do like weird stuff,

43:29.020 --> 43:30.840
 including sacrifices and stuff like that.

43:30.840 --> 43:34.040
 Yeah, and I also think that's why AlphaZero was so shocking

43:34.040 --> 43:37.320
 because Stockfish was using an opening database.

43:37.320 --> 43:39.720
 So it was already based off of knowledge

43:39.720 --> 43:41.880
 that humans have from playing chess for years

43:41.880 --> 43:43.840
 that we just thought is how you're supposed to play.

43:43.840 --> 43:45.300
 Whereas AlphaZero just learned

43:45.300 --> 43:47.240
 from playing the game so many times

43:47.240 --> 43:49.880
 and came up with very novel opening ideas.

43:49.880 --> 43:52.000
 Were you impressed by AlphaZero?

43:52.000 --> 43:53.200
 Have you seen some of the games?

43:53.200 --> 43:54.480
 I have seen some of the games.

43:54.480 --> 43:59.480
 I think impressed, bewildered, and motivated

43:59.480 --> 44:01.400
 were the three things I experienced.

44:01.400 --> 44:04.880
 I think Magnus said he was also impressed

44:04.880 --> 44:09.000
 that it could easily be mistaken for creativity.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.800
 That's his trash talk towards the AI.

44:10.800 --> 44:12.340
 That was a beautiful sentence.

44:12.340 --> 44:14.460
 I was listening to the podcast.

44:14.460 --> 44:17.080
 I mean, as a human, I agree with him

44:17.080 --> 44:18.400
 because you don't wanna give the machine

44:18.400 --> 44:20.440
 the power of creativity,

44:20.440 --> 44:25.440
 but if it looks creative, give it a compliment.

44:25.680 --> 44:27.320
 That's fair.

44:27.320 --> 44:29.280
 I know that you're being nice to the machines

44:29.280 --> 44:32.160
 in case they are ever looking back through this.

44:32.160 --> 44:33.200
 What else is there?

44:33.200 --> 44:36.920
 What other principles are there for the opening?

44:36.920 --> 44:39.840
 You can go a little bit more forward, let's say.

44:39.840 --> 44:42.040
 Yeah, we can finish full development.

44:42.040 --> 44:43.920
 Positions like this, let's just say

44:43.920 --> 44:45.840
 you developed all of your pieces.

44:45.840 --> 44:49.480
 So that's like a really nice,

44:49.480 --> 44:51.680
 like nobody took any pieces

44:51.680 --> 44:53.800
 and we're just in a nice positional thing.

44:53.800 --> 44:56.880
 Yeah, so it's not actually a very accurate one.

44:56.880 --> 44:59.160
 So I'm actually, I could put a different one on the board,

44:59.160 --> 45:03.120
 but usually after you've developed all of your pieces,

45:03.120 --> 45:05.480
 you wanna get your queen out a little bit

45:05.480 --> 45:06.720
 to connect your rooks,

45:06.720 --> 45:09.320
 and you also start thinking about certain pawn pushes

45:09.320 --> 45:11.200
 and getting more space.

45:11.200 --> 45:14.080
 But another good tip is just can you improve

45:14.080 --> 45:15.840
 the position of your pieces?

45:15.840 --> 45:16.920
 Think about timing.

45:16.920 --> 45:19.000
 So if you've already moved a piece once

45:19.000 --> 45:20.600
 and there's a piece that hasn't moved at all,

45:20.600 --> 45:23.440
 then you wanna focus on the piece that hasn't moved at all

45:23.440 --> 45:26.680
 to be able to have it more likely to jump into the game.

45:26.680 --> 45:28.680
 Right, so don't move pieces multiple times.

45:28.680 --> 45:29.520
 Exactly.

45:29.520 --> 45:31.440
 Like try to move it to the most optimal position.

45:31.440 --> 45:32.280
 Yeah.

45:32.280 --> 45:33.400
 Yeah, that makes sense.

45:33.400 --> 45:37.480
 What, so what's the Indian,

45:37.480 --> 45:38.800
 I think we kind of went over it,

45:38.800 --> 45:41.880
 but did you ever say why you like it so much?

45:41.880 --> 45:42.720
 Because it's weird?

45:42.720 --> 45:43.560
 Because it's king size?

45:43.560 --> 45:48.200
 I liked it because it's a very fun, aggressive defense

45:48.200 --> 45:51.960
 where you're just throwing your pieces towards white,

45:51.960 --> 45:55.720
 and there's so many sacrificing opportunities.

45:55.720 --> 45:56.640
 And for some reason,

45:56.640 --> 45:59.560
 tactical games always feel like the most beautiful,

45:59.560 --> 46:01.240
 the most satisfying,

46:01.240 --> 46:03.120
 and that's what I liked about the King's Indian.

46:03.120 --> 46:06.360
 But I also suffered a lot from this love

46:06.360 --> 46:07.560
 because I would play things

46:07.560 --> 46:09.440
 that are not necessarily correct,

46:09.440 --> 46:11.040
 then my attack wouldn't pan out,

46:11.040 --> 46:12.800
 and then I would just struggle the rest of the game

46:12.800 --> 46:14.600
 having no play and just trying to defend.

46:14.600 --> 46:15.440
 So if you're always attacking,

46:15.440 --> 46:16.920
 Wikipedia also says that,

46:16.920 --> 46:19.680
 that you're known for your attacking play.

46:19.680 --> 46:22.560
 It's also known for losses according to Stanford.

46:22.560 --> 46:23.800
 Okay, let's not bring that up.

46:23.800 --> 46:25.600
 See Wikipedia doesn't talk trash,

46:25.600 --> 46:27.560
 it just says nice things.

46:27.560 --> 46:29.120
 Yeah, Wikipedia's a lot nicer.

46:29.120 --> 46:32.640
 I actually played a lot of positional chess in classic

46:32.640 --> 46:35.320
 because I really like the slow squeeze,

46:35.320 --> 46:38.640
 but when I transitioned to playing a lot of online chess,

46:38.640 --> 46:40.560
 it's almost as if I was looking

46:40.560 --> 46:42.280
 for more instant gratification

46:42.280 --> 46:44.240
 because it feels so much better

46:44.240 --> 46:46.280
 to beat someone with an attack.

46:46.280 --> 46:48.280
 And even if sometimes it doesn't pan out,

46:48.280 --> 46:51.240
 I was okay with it because you get so many games in.

46:51.240 --> 46:54.160
 So I think my style in online chess

46:54.160 --> 46:56.280
 really changed from my classical chess.

46:56.280 --> 46:57.120
 What about you Andrea?

46:57.120 --> 46:58.160
 Do you have a style?

46:58.160 --> 46:59.120
 Are you attacking?

46:59.120 --> 47:02.720
 Are you a more like conservative defensive player?

47:02.720 --> 47:03.640
 Are you chaotic?

47:03.640 --> 47:06.200
 Opening wise, I like to play more positionally.

47:06.200 --> 47:09.680
 Like I like to push T4 and just slowly improve my pieces

47:09.680 --> 47:10.720
 and slowly get an attack.

47:10.720 --> 47:13.400
 But like Alex said, if you're playing bullet chess

47:13.400 --> 47:15.440
 or blitz against viewers,

47:15.440 --> 47:19.160
 you often like wanna play riskier moves

47:19.160 --> 47:20.640
 that may not be as good.

47:20.640 --> 47:23.080
 And then that's kind of when I would play more aggressive.

47:23.080 --> 47:25.320
 But I do enjoy tournaments for that reason

47:25.320 --> 47:29.120
 because then like once you're 15 moves in,

47:29.120 --> 47:31.400
 which as soon as you're out of your prep,

47:31.400 --> 47:33.800
 I like sitting and thinking in more positional,

47:34.880 --> 47:37.200
 yeah, positional middle games.

47:37.200 --> 47:39.840
 One of the games you found to be pretty cool

47:39.840 --> 47:44.800
 was the Hakara Nakamura versus Galfan in 2009.

47:44.800 --> 47:47.680
 And that one I think includes the King's Indian defense.

47:47.680 --> 47:48.520
 Yes.

47:49.800 --> 47:52.240
 Why is that an interesting one to you?

47:52.240 --> 47:54.160
 I also play the King's Indian as black

47:54.160 --> 47:56.240
 and I love this model game.

47:56.240 --> 47:58.160
 But as Alex was saying,

47:58.160 --> 48:00.440
 like all these advantages for the King's Indian.

48:00.440 --> 48:02.160
 But now there's this one line

48:02.160 --> 48:04.360
 that like every higher rated player

48:04.360 --> 48:06.600
 just destroys my King's Indian.

48:06.600 --> 48:08.560
 And you see these beautiful games and like,

48:08.560 --> 48:10.640
 ah, yes, I wanna play for these ideas.

48:10.640 --> 48:12.280
 But now no one plays into it anymore

48:12.280 --> 48:13.440
 and you just get demolished.

48:13.440 --> 48:15.360
 So this is why I don't play the King's Indian anymore,

48:15.360 --> 48:16.400
 but not to ruin the fun.

48:16.400 --> 48:18.280
 It's a love hate relationship, truly.

48:18.280 --> 48:19.320
 The reality.

48:19.320 --> 48:21.000
 But that's like the higher level players do

48:21.000 --> 48:21.840
 or does everybody?

48:21.840 --> 48:23.520
 Yeah, if you're studying openings

48:23.520 --> 48:25.440
 and you know this line as white,

48:25.440 --> 48:27.960
 you just, you automatically get the upper edge.

48:27.960 --> 48:29.760
 And that's kind of how openings develop.

48:29.760 --> 48:32.840
 You start having players trying new lines

48:32.840 --> 48:35.200
 and then you see ones and then everybody adopts it

48:35.200 --> 48:36.600
 if they think it's the best one.

48:36.600 --> 48:38.520
 But yeah, so Hikaru is really known

48:38.520 --> 48:41.000
 for his aggressive style of play.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.160
 Is Hikaru black here or what?

48:42.160 --> 48:43.240
 Yeah, Hikaru is black here.

48:43.240 --> 48:45.240
 So he's playing the King's Indian.

48:45.240 --> 48:47.560
 And as you can see in this position,

48:47.560 --> 48:51.320
 white already has a lot, a huge center advantage.

48:51.320 --> 48:52.880
 But what Hikaru is gonna start doing

48:52.880 --> 48:56.040
 even with the next move is bringing all of his pieces

48:56.040 --> 48:57.640
 towards the white King side,

48:57.640 --> 49:00.520
 because his plan is to start pushing his pawns

49:00.520 --> 49:03.320
 towards the white King and ignore the attack

49:03.320 --> 49:04.160
 that goes on in the Queen side.

49:04.160 --> 49:06.880
 It's all of the dream attack with the King's Indian.

49:06.880 --> 49:09.920
 So there's a complete asymmetry towards the King side

49:09.920 --> 49:12.640
 and the left side of the board is a ton of pieces.

49:12.640 --> 49:13.720
 Yeah, exactly.

49:14.920 --> 49:17.360
 Wow, he moved the knight like three times in a row.

49:17.360 --> 49:19.080
 Yep, and that's what you need to do

49:19.080 --> 49:20.560
 because you have to move the knight

49:20.560 --> 49:22.600
 in order to make space for your pawn.

49:22.600 --> 49:24.800
 So again, this is why it's so counterintuitive

49:24.800 --> 49:26.360
 and Stockfish doesn't like it.

49:26.360 --> 49:29.680
 You're putting almost most of your pieces on the back rank

49:29.680 --> 49:31.560
 and you're pushing your King side pawns

49:31.560 --> 49:33.520
 and you're blocking your own dark squared Bishop.

49:33.520 --> 49:35.400
 So none of it makes sense.

49:35.400 --> 49:37.760
 You're mimicking it, that's awesome.

49:37.760 --> 49:39.640
 Okay, so yeah, here you see white going

49:39.640 --> 49:40.880
 for a Queen side attack,

49:40.880 --> 49:42.640
 black going for the King side attack

49:42.640 --> 49:43.960
 and you can keep going a little bit

49:43.960 --> 49:47.720
 and I'll wait to where he starts with the pretty sacrifices.

49:47.720 --> 49:50.280
 It's more fun to analyze games in person

49:50.280 --> 49:51.480
 than on the computer, I think.

49:51.480 --> 49:52.320
 Yeah.

49:53.720 --> 49:57.320
 Okay, so here Hikaru is preparing the attack

49:57.320 --> 49:59.160
 and what I really like about this game

49:59.160 --> 50:01.600
 is that he finds these tactics

50:01.600 --> 50:05.200
 that are not necessarily what a computer would go for

50:05.200 --> 50:07.720
 but it's very hard to face as a human

50:07.720 --> 50:09.880
 and that's why a lot of people play the King's Indian

50:09.880 --> 50:12.120
 because in practice it's hard to defend against.

50:12.120 --> 50:14.360
 So we can keep moving a little bit forward.

50:16.680 --> 50:17.520
 Okay.

50:19.040 --> 50:21.760
 Yep, so white is just continuing the King side plan.

50:21.760 --> 50:23.960
 No, is that like the first piece

50:23.960 --> 50:25.240
 I think that's taken in the game?

50:25.240 --> 50:26.560
 Yep, that's the first trade.

50:26.560 --> 50:27.920
 Attack begins.

50:27.920 --> 50:30.760
 Exactly, Hikaru had to pause his attack for a little bit

50:30.760 --> 50:33.120
 to just make sure that white didn't have

50:33.120 --> 50:35.280
 two dire threats on the Queen side.

50:35.280 --> 50:37.560
 So cool to see the asymmetry of this thing.

50:37.560 --> 50:39.960
 Exactly, that's what's beautiful about the King's Indian.

50:39.960 --> 50:41.360
 And just one thing to highlight

50:41.360 --> 50:44.240
 because his rook move here is very bizarre

50:44.240 --> 50:47.040
 and typically like a computer probably didn't like this

50:47.040 --> 50:48.880
 but the ideas are interesting

50:48.880 --> 50:51.120
 because this is a major weakness for black

50:51.120 --> 50:52.480
 that they're coming to attack

50:52.480 --> 50:54.640
 and he's also making room for his Bishop

50:54.640 --> 50:56.120
 to come backwards and challenge.

50:56.120 --> 50:58.160
 So this is like a human like maneuver

50:58.160 --> 50:59.000
 that computers would like.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.480
 I think computers would like this though

51:00.480 --> 51:02.440
 because you'd have to move it regardless

51:02.440 --> 51:03.920
 because he takes the pawn here

51:03.920 --> 51:05.720
 and his rook would be under attack.

51:05.720 --> 51:07.840
 Yeah, well having looked at it,

51:07.840 --> 51:09.360
 when I actually studied this as a line

51:09.360 --> 51:11.720
 and this right away isn't the best move cutting computer.

51:11.720 --> 51:13.360
 So actually that's such a good question.

51:13.360 --> 51:15.520
 So do you guys when you study games use your mind

51:15.520 --> 51:19.440
 but do you also use computers to build up your intuition

51:19.440 --> 51:20.920
 of like looking at a position like this

51:20.920 --> 51:22.400
 and what would a computer do

51:22.400 --> 51:24.840
 and then try to understand why it wants to do that?

51:24.840 --> 51:26.600
 When I was studying seriously

51:26.600 --> 51:28.600
 I would try to use my own mind

51:28.600 --> 51:31.400
 because you're never gonna get the exact same position

51:31.400 --> 51:33.560
 so you really need to notice trends

51:33.560 --> 51:35.280
 and often computers will give you moves

51:35.280 --> 51:38.040
 that are only specific to that position

51:38.040 --> 51:40.320
 because of a certain tactic.

51:40.320 --> 51:43.000
 But I do use computers to check what I did

51:43.000 --> 51:44.760
 and make sure I didn't make any obvious blunder

51:44.760 --> 51:45.960
 that I might have missed.

51:45.960 --> 51:47.000
 What does a computer tell you?

51:47.000 --> 51:49.040
 Just like what is the best move

51:49.040 --> 51:52.560
 or does it give you any kind of explanation of why?

51:52.560 --> 51:54.080
 It doesn't tell you why

51:54.080 --> 51:57.040
 but it gives you the different valuations of the position

51:57.040 --> 52:01.200
 like black is down a half pawn here or something like that

52:02.120 --> 52:04.560
 but it hints you towards what the right move is

52:04.560 --> 52:06.640
 and then it's on you to figure out why

52:06.640 --> 52:09.280
 and you can usually figure out why if not right away

52:09.280 --> 52:10.680
 then just by going through a few moves

52:10.680 --> 52:12.840
 and being like, oh, okay, that makes sense.

52:12.840 --> 52:15.040
 I feel like a computer will take you down

52:15.040 --> 52:18.560
 with some weird lines potentially like sacrifice.

52:18.560 --> 52:20.960
 Like why the hell am I sacrificing this?

52:20.960 --> 52:23.320
 Well, we'll get to the pretty sacrifice soon.

52:24.520 --> 52:25.800
 So we could just keep playing.

52:25.800 --> 52:27.480
 The pawns are being pushed forward.

52:27.480 --> 52:31.760
 Yeah, and Hikaru is kind of ignoring

52:31.760 --> 52:33.800
 the queen side attack here.

52:33.800 --> 52:37.240
 They basically both only reply to each other's plan

52:37.240 --> 52:38.280
 when they have to.

52:39.400 --> 52:41.920
 This is where you convert all the podcast viewers

52:41.920 --> 52:43.160
 to YouTube.

52:43.160 --> 52:44.000
 Yeah.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.200
 They have no idea what we're talking about right now.

52:46.200 --> 52:48.160
 There is a Zen like experience

52:48.160 --> 52:50.280
 of just like listening and imagining.

52:50.280 --> 52:51.120
 The board.

52:51.120 --> 52:52.960
 Just imagine the pieces on the ceiling.

52:52.960 --> 52:55.240
 Yeah, we should be calling them out

52:55.240 --> 52:56.880
 and then people will be freaking out even more.

52:56.880 --> 52:59.600
 Am I supposed to keep track of what the position is?

52:59.600 --> 53:01.600
 It's too late now.

53:01.600 --> 53:02.440
 It's too many.

53:02.440 --> 53:03.440
 How hard is blindfold chess?

53:03.440 --> 53:04.280
 Have you tried?

53:04.280 --> 53:05.600
 Like are you able to keep the mind?

53:05.600 --> 53:07.480
 I've played blindfold chess before.

53:08.400 --> 53:09.680
 For me, it's pretty hard.

53:09.680 --> 53:11.360
 It's not a muscle that I've trained as much

53:11.360 --> 53:13.560
 and I'm very visual when it comes to chess.

53:14.640 --> 53:16.880
 But it is one as a top player

53:16.880 --> 53:20.080
 that starts becoming very second nature for you.

53:20.080 --> 53:23.080
 Actually, this is what, I talked to Magnus about this.

53:23.080 --> 53:26.440
 Maybe I was, again, influenced by Queen's Gambit.

53:26.440 --> 53:29.160
 What do you actually visualize when it's in your head?

53:29.160 --> 53:31.360
 So for Magnus, it was a boring 2D board.

53:31.360 --> 53:32.200
 Right.

53:32.200 --> 53:33.040
 Do you have some kind of?

53:33.040 --> 53:34.720
 That's every chess player, no.

53:34.720 --> 53:35.560
 You don't have like,

53:35.560 --> 53:38.520
 cause you know some chess like computer games,

53:38.520 --> 53:41.800
 you can do all kinds of skins and like fancy stuff.

53:41.800 --> 53:42.640
 You don't have any fancy stuff?

53:42.640 --> 53:45.920
 Sadly, I don't have like a cool 3D warrior mode on.

53:45.920 --> 53:46.760
 It's just the basic.

53:46.760 --> 53:49.040
 I just have the default chess base board in my head.

53:49.040 --> 53:51.840
 Cause you don't, yeah, you can't use your brain power

53:51.840 --> 53:53.240
 for adding colors to it

53:53.240 --> 53:55.280
 cause you already have to keep track of the pieces.

53:55.280 --> 53:56.920
 And it's one board at a time?

53:56.920 --> 53:57.760
 Yes.

53:57.760 --> 53:58.600
 Okay.

53:58.600 --> 53:59.440
 The current position.

53:59.440 --> 54:00.280
 Yeah, I bet every chess.

54:00.280 --> 54:01.840
 I wonder if there's any who hit it differently.

54:01.840 --> 54:04.440
 There's certain players who are really good

54:04.440 --> 54:06.280
 and they can even play blindfold chess

54:06.280 --> 54:08.520
 and play multiple games at the same time.

54:09.640 --> 54:11.440
 So I would be curious how they do it.

54:11.440 --> 54:13.160
 But usually when you're thinking of one game,

54:13.160 --> 54:14.960
 that's the only one in your mind.

54:14.960 --> 54:16.480
 Yeah, but you have to do this operation

54:16.480 --> 54:18.640
 where you move one piece.

54:18.640 --> 54:22.360
 You're doing like the branch analysis.

54:22.360 --> 54:27.360
 Like, and so you still have to somehow visualize

54:27.440 --> 54:31.360
 the branching process and not forget stuff.

54:31.360 --> 54:34.640
 Maybe that's like constant memory recall or something.

54:34.640 --> 54:36.640
 You're always looking at one board at a time, but.

54:36.640 --> 54:38.880
 And you're also, oh, cause you're also looking in the future.

54:38.880 --> 54:39.720
 Yeah.

54:39.720 --> 54:40.560
 Cause then you have to back track.

54:40.560 --> 54:41.400
 Calculating variations and coming back.

54:41.400 --> 54:44.120
 I guess you're keeping the position in your memory.

54:44.120 --> 54:45.920
 So you're remembering where all the pieces are

54:45.920 --> 54:48.240
 and then you're playing it out on one board

54:48.240 --> 54:50.720
 and then you can come back to the initial one

54:50.720 --> 54:52.600
 that you started with that you kind of just keep

54:52.600 --> 54:55.280
 in your brain and it's also easier to come back to it

54:55.280 --> 54:57.600
 once you've played a position from it.

54:57.600 --> 55:02.600
 I feel like it's that memory recall

55:03.040 --> 55:04.760
 that gets you to blunder.

55:04.760 --> 55:09.120
 So I'll like see that I'm being attacked by certain things,

55:09.120 --> 55:11.840
 but then because I get so exhausted thinking

55:11.840 --> 55:13.640
 about a different thing, I forget,

55:13.640 --> 55:16.480
 I actually forget about an entire branch of things

55:16.480 --> 55:17.800
 that I was supposed to be worried about.

55:17.800 --> 55:18.920
 It happens very often.

55:18.920 --> 55:19.760
 Yeah.

55:19.760 --> 55:22.320
 If you spend a bunch of time calculating in a position,

55:22.320 --> 55:24.160
 let's say like when you're really in trouble

55:24.160 --> 55:26.800
 and you're spending 15, 20 minutes calculating,

55:26.800 --> 55:29.000
 you'll forget about something that you spotted like,

55:29.000 --> 55:32.080
 oh, if I do these two, three moves, I'll walk into a trap

55:32.080 --> 55:34.040
 cause you've looked at so many lines and then you play it

55:34.040 --> 55:36.440
 and then you see it and you're like, oh, I looked at it

55:36.440 --> 55:39.000
 and I saw it, but I forgot about it.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.760
 It's often called tunneling where you're just looking

55:41.760 --> 55:43.880
 so deeply on one thing you forget about the rest

55:43.880 --> 55:45.120
 of the board.

55:45.120 --> 55:47.920
 And it's the worst when, at least in a beginner level,

55:47.920 --> 55:51.320
 there's like a, I don't know, a Bishop just sitting there,

55:51.320 --> 55:54.640
 obviously attacking your like queen or something.

55:54.640 --> 55:57.600
 And then you just forget that Bishop exists.

55:57.600 --> 55:59.480
 Cause if they just sit there for a few moves

55:59.480 --> 56:02.880
 and don't move, you just forget their existence.

56:02.880 --> 56:05.720
 And then it's just, yeah, that's definitely very embarrassing.

56:05.720 --> 56:07.520
 Well, it happens to everyone, so.

56:08.560 --> 56:09.400
 Yes.

56:10.320 --> 56:11.440
 Okay, cool.

56:11.440 --> 56:16.040
 Okay, so we see a few trades happening on the queen side

56:16.040 --> 56:18.960
 where he had to go for those, otherwise he's in trouble.

56:18.960 --> 56:22.200
 And this is where the game, oh, sorry.

56:22.200 --> 56:23.960
 This is where it gets exciting.

56:23.960 --> 56:28.840
 Yeah, so Knight H4 is really when the sacrifice starts.

56:28.840 --> 56:33.320
 And here the two important pawns are the ones in front

56:33.320 --> 56:35.880
 of the King, cause they're helping with the entire defense

56:35.880 --> 56:38.800
 and Hikaru is actually preparing to sacrifice his Knight

56:38.800 --> 56:42.440
 for a pawn just so that he can continue his attack

56:42.440 --> 56:43.800
 and open up the position.

56:43.800 --> 56:45.760
 Because if you don't do that here as black

56:45.760 --> 56:47.040
 and don't get some kind of attack,

56:47.040 --> 56:49.320
 you are completely lost on the queen side.

56:49.320 --> 56:51.920
 And also you've pushed all of your own king side pawns,

56:51.920 --> 56:53.120
 so you're gonna be in danger.

56:53.120 --> 56:55.760
 So it's one of those do or die moments.

56:55.760 --> 56:57.680
 Oh, okay, so that's what makes it all in,

56:57.680 --> 56:58.880
 cause the King is wide open.

56:58.880 --> 57:01.080
 Yeah, yeah, the King is wide open

57:01.080 --> 57:03.880
 and all of White's pieces are pointed

57:03.880 --> 57:06.080
 towards the queen side too, where you're also cramped.

57:06.080 --> 57:08.200
 So is the attack primarily by black done

57:08.200 --> 57:10.320
 by the two pawns and the Knight?

57:10.320 --> 57:13.160
 And the light squared Bishop is always extremely important.

57:13.160 --> 57:15.240
 So you don't wanna trade this in the King's Indian

57:15.240 --> 57:18.480
 because it's very helpful for a lot of attacks.

57:18.480 --> 57:19.960
 Even though it's on the other side of the board,

57:19.960 --> 57:22.280
 I guess it can go all the way across in,

57:23.200 --> 57:25.160
 like I'm not sure what it's doing here,

57:25.160 --> 57:26.080
 but probably threatening.

57:26.080 --> 57:29.240
 Like for example, if it was another move black

57:29.240 --> 57:32.000
 could have played would be something like Bishop H3,

57:32.000 --> 57:33.200
 where if you take the Bishop,

57:33.200 --> 57:35.440
 you actually get mated on G2.

57:35.440 --> 57:36.280
 With what?

57:36.280 --> 57:37.480
 So let's say you take here

57:37.480 --> 57:39.200
 and then you could push the pawn

57:39.200 --> 57:40.920
 and then it would be checkmate.

57:40.920 --> 57:44.480
 So you're kind of using your Bishop to sacrifice

57:44.480 --> 57:47.400
 against White's King side pawns.

57:47.400 --> 57:50.840
 Yeah, I'll be freaking out if their Bishop did that.

57:50.840 --> 57:51.800
 What are they up to?

57:51.800 --> 57:53.200
 Right, and that's the thing,

57:53.200 --> 57:55.320
 this position looks very scary as White

57:55.320 --> 57:57.200
 because all of Black's pawns are starting

57:57.200 --> 57:58.560
 to come towards you.

57:58.560 --> 58:01.000
 And it's one of those things where humans

58:01.000 --> 58:03.040
 do start to worry in these positions,

58:03.040 --> 58:05.200
 whereas computers obviously can just calculate

58:05.200 --> 58:07.520
 the best line and maybe the attack doesn't go through.

58:07.520 --> 58:09.200
 So you're saying the computer might say

58:09.200 --> 58:12.160
 that the White is actually a slight favorite here?

58:12.160 --> 58:13.680
 Yeah, potentially.

58:13.680 --> 58:17.040
 Okay, so then White makes a little bit of room

58:17.040 --> 58:18.160
 by moving the Rook.

58:18.160 --> 58:19.000
 Right.

58:19.000 --> 58:20.360
 And the attack begins.

58:20.360 --> 58:21.760
 I like the commentary here.

58:23.160 --> 58:26.200
 The Knight is hugging the King.

58:26.200 --> 58:28.800
 And actually White can't even take the King here

58:28.800 --> 58:31.360
 because then H4 and H3 is coming in.

58:31.360 --> 58:32.640
 White can't take the Knight.

58:32.640 --> 58:33.840
 Yeah, oh did I say King?

58:33.840 --> 58:35.080
 Yes, thank you, the Knight.

58:35.080 --> 58:37.440
 White can't take the Knight because why?

58:37.440 --> 58:39.360
 So if White takes the Knight here,

58:39.360 --> 58:41.960
 then Black starts pushing his pawn to H4

58:41.960 --> 58:45.360
 with H3 incoming and the idea of trying

58:45.360 --> 58:49.760
 to defend against this is, it looks very difficult.

58:49.760 --> 58:51.200
 So White just chooses.

58:51.200 --> 58:53.200
 It'd be cool to watch a chess game,

58:53.200 --> 58:55.960
 to experience watching it without understanding it

58:55.960 --> 58:57.080
 just for a day.

58:57.080 --> 58:59.440
 Feel like I could use that to make better content.

58:59.440 --> 59:00.280
 True.

59:01.320 --> 59:02.160
 Okay.

59:02.160 --> 59:03.240
 I mean, that's what getting drunk does.

59:03.240 --> 59:05.720
 Unfortunately for chess players,

59:05.720 --> 59:07.600
 it never leaves your brain.

59:07.600 --> 59:08.880
 Doesn't matter how.

59:08.880 --> 59:10.840
 But this is actually a very cute move

59:10.840 --> 59:13.480
 because Black's Queen is under attack,

59:13.480 --> 59:16.880
 but the King is so cramped that he can't actually take it

59:16.880 --> 59:18.680
 or he's gonna get checkmated by a pawn,

59:18.680 --> 59:20.920
 which is a sad way to go cruelly.

59:20.920 --> 59:23.200
 Yeah, those pawns are doing a lot of work here.

59:23.200 --> 59:24.040
 They really are.

59:24.040 --> 59:24.880
 That is the King's Indian.

59:24.880 --> 59:26.720
 This is the King's Indian player's dream.

59:26.720 --> 59:29.120
 The attack of the King side pawns.

59:29.120 --> 59:31.240
 Yeah, these pawns are like, right,

59:31.240 --> 59:32.720
 so they're the ones that are doing a lot

59:32.720 --> 59:33.840
 of the threatening.

59:33.840 --> 59:35.960
 Right, and they're also opening up the position

59:35.960 --> 59:37.640
 to bring more of the pieces in.

59:37.640 --> 59:41.560
 But the pawns kind of help break open the King side,

59:41.560 --> 59:43.560
 but they can't checkmate by themselves.

59:43.560 --> 59:44.880
 So after the pawns come in,

59:44.880 --> 59:46.760
 that's when you need to start bringing in pieces as well,

59:46.760 --> 59:49.360
 which you will see Ahi Kar do here.

59:49.360 --> 59:50.200
 Okay. There you go.

59:50.200 --> 59:52.000
 He puts. One more sacrifice.

59:52.000 --> 59:55.200
 This was actually another beautiful sacrifice in the game.

59:56.360 --> 59:59.040
 But then puts the King in check with a pawn.

59:59.040 --> 1:00:02.080
 Right, and the pawn is going to be given here for free,

1:00:02.080 --> 1:00:04.180
 but the idea is you're giving your own piece

1:00:04.180 --> 1:00:07.660
 because you want to have more space and open up the King,

1:00:07.660 --> 1:00:09.260
 which is what you're always trying to do

1:00:09.260 --> 1:00:10.100
 when you have a King side.

1:00:10.100 --> 1:00:12.180
 You're trying to remove as many of the King's defenders

1:00:12.180 --> 1:00:14.600
 as you can without giving up too much.

1:00:14.600 --> 1:00:17.680
 And then you have a ton of pieces on the King side

1:00:17.680 --> 1:00:20.360
 for black, just waiting to.

1:00:20.360 --> 1:00:21.400
 Exactly.

1:00:21.400 --> 1:00:22.480
 To do harm.

1:00:22.480 --> 1:00:23.320
 And then.

1:00:23.320 --> 1:00:25.400
 And notice how every single move,

1:00:25.400 --> 1:00:26.840
 white is getting attacked.

1:00:26.840 --> 1:00:28.480
 Like they're just never getting a break.

1:00:28.480 --> 1:00:30.000
 Black just keeps throwing all their pieces.

1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:32.520
 So it's funny that black's Queen has been hanging

1:00:32.520 --> 1:00:33.920
 for like three moves now

1:00:33.920 --> 1:00:36.160
 and white still can't do anything about it.

1:00:36.160 --> 1:00:38.520
 So rook puts the King in check.

1:00:38.520 --> 1:00:40.200
 The King runs.

1:00:40.200 --> 1:00:44.000
 And then again, we leave the Queen hanging

1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:45.160
 and you develop a piece,

1:00:45.160 --> 1:00:46.900
 this light squared Bishop that's so important,

1:00:46.900 --> 1:00:50.040
 and you're once again threatening checkmate on G2.

1:00:51.040 --> 1:00:53.600
 And then Bishops coming to the game.

1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:55.880
 Once again, the Queen hanging.

1:00:55.880 --> 1:00:57.520
 I mean, the game is just so beautiful.

1:00:57.520 --> 1:01:02.520
 The amount of calculation Hikaru put into this position.

1:01:02.640 --> 1:01:04.320
 It feels like so much is in danger.

1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:05.160
 Right.

1:01:05.160 --> 1:01:06.000
 It's so interesting.

1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:09.040
 And Knight takes what?

1:01:09.040 --> 1:01:09.880
 A pawns.

1:01:09.880 --> 1:01:12.160
 So now his Queen is attacked twice

1:01:12.160 --> 1:01:13.920
 and he doesn't care.

1:01:13.920 --> 1:01:14.880
 He takes the Bishop

1:01:14.880 --> 1:01:17.800
 and he's still threatening the checkmate on G2.

1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:21.960
 And then the Queen takes the Bishop.

1:01:21.960 --> 1:01:24.320
 So now he's defending against G2

1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:29.320
 and black just goes and grabs some material back here.

1:01:29.720 --> 1:01:32.400
 So here, black is already is winning.

1:01:32.400 --> 1:01:34.200
 Well, he ends up winning a Knight here

1:01:34.200 --> 1:01:37.240
 because black had to be so much on the defensive.

1:01:38.400 --> 1:01:39.400
 He's just taking pieces.

1:01:39.400 --> 1:01:40.440
 Yeah, I mean at this point,

1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:41.880
 you're up two whole pieces.

1:01:41.880 --> 1:01:43.000
 So you knew it was in here.

1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:44.280
 Yeah, exactly.

1:01:44.280 --> 1:01:45.120
 But.

1:01:46.240 --> 1:01:47.760
 And Queen.

1:01:47.760 --> 1:01:48.600
 Queen.

1:01:49.440 --> 1:01:51.420
 And then you take,

1:01:51.420 --> 1:01:53.240
 and then the rook takes

1:01:53.240 --> 1:01:56.720
 and there's not as much of an attack on the King anymore,

1:01:56.720 --> 1:01:59.720
 but Hikaru is up a Knight here,

1:01:59.720 --> 1:02:01.880
 which is GG.

1:02:01.880 --> 1:02:04.840
 Yeah, what's the correct way of saying that?

1:02:04.840 --> 1:02:07.520
 Because I played Demis Hassabis.

1:02:07.520 --> 1:02:09.000
 I played him in chess.

1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:13.400
 And then I quickly realized like from his facial expressions

1:02:13.400 --> 1:02:16.520
 that I should have like stopped playing.

1:02:16.520 --> 1:02:17.360
 Oh.

1:02:17.360 --> 1:02:19.000
 It was like, it's already set.

1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:20.000
 Yeah, when it's.

1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:23.960
 And then he's like, like, this is the good time to like,

1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:24.800
 give up.

1:02:24.800 --> 1:02:25.640
 Right.

1:02:25.640 --> 1:02:27.400
 You're not gonna get to checkmate where like this,

1:02:27.400 --> 1:02:29.000
 you know, he could see like,

1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:32.440
 the checkmate is like five or seven moves away or something.

1:02:32.440 --> 1:02:34.800
 And what's the play?

1:02:34.800 --> 1:02:38.720
 Usually you have to resign if you're in a position

1:02:38.720 --> 1:02:41.800
 or you should through chess etiquette resign

1:02:41.800 --> 1:02:44.760
 when you're in a position where your opponent

1:02:44.760 --> 1:02:46.640
 is definitely gonna win out of respect.

1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:48.520
 Like if you're a piece down.

1:02:48.520 --> 1:02:51.640
 And obviously all top grandmasters do that.

1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:53.880
 The only people who don't do that is kids

1:02:53.880 --> 1:02:54.720
 because their coaches.

1:02:54.720 --> 1:02:55.560
 They love to play till the checkmate.

1:02:55.560 --> 1:02:57.760
 Their coaches always tell them never resign

1:02:57.760 --> 1:02:59.840
 and they'll be in hopelessly lost positions

1:02:59.840 --> 1:03:02.440
 playing against like two rooks, a king,

1:03:02.440 --> 1:03:03.960
 and they only have their sole king,

1:03:03.960 --> 1:03:05.760
 but they're still playing on.

1:03:05.760 --> 1:03:08.000
 So that's a position where it's obvious they can't win.

1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:09.600
 Because the kids might make errors.

1:03:09.600 --> 1:03:10.440
 Yeah, exactly.

1:03:10.440 --> 1:03:11.440
 And so it might as well.

1:03:11.440 --> 1:03:12.800
 That was the interesting thing about,

1:03:12.800 --> 1:03:15.720
 I think game six of the previous world championship

1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:16.720
 with Magnus.

1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:18.400
 Was it the one where he beat Nap?

1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:20.360
 Yeah, the first time he beat him,

1:03:20.360 --> 1:03:23.600
 where it was like, he said that,

1:03:23.600 --> 1:03:26.000
 I don't know how often you come across

1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:26.840
 this kind of situation.

1:03:26.840 --> 1:03:29.520
 He said, the engines predict a draw,

1:03:30.400 --> 1:03:33.360
 but that doesn't mean that it's going to be a draw.

1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:38.360
 So you play on hoping that you take a person into,

1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:40.480
 I mean, this is, I guess, an end game thing.

1:03:40.480 --> 1:03:41.640
 You take them to deep water

1:03:41.640 --> 1:03:43.840
 and they make a positional mistake or something.

1:03:43.840 --> 1:03:47.360
 I don't know when, like he from his gut knows

1:03:47.360 --> 1:03:48.680
 that this is supposed to be a draw,

1:03:48.680 --> 1:03:50.000
 but he still plays on.

1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:52.520
 Yeah, I mean, that is one where

1:03:52.520 --> 1:03:54.600
 it could theoretically be a draw,

1:03:54.600 --> 1:03:56.840
 but it could be very hard to defend

1:03:56.840 --> 1:03:59.680
 because it's a hard technique to know as a human.

1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:01.120
 And especially in that game,

1:04:01.120 --> 1:04:04.080
 I know that Nepo was also in time pressure,

1:04:04.080 --> 1:04:05.640
 which makes it even harder.

1:04:05.640 --> 1:04:07.920
 So in situations like that, you should always continue.

1:04:07.920 --> 1:04:10.160
 It's more where an engine would give you something

1:04:10.160 --> 1:04:14.440
 like plus 10 or something where it's not just clearly a win,

1:04:14.440 --> 1:04:16.000
 but anybody would know how to win.

1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:18.840
 And that's where you're usually supposed to resign.

1:04:18.840 --> 1:04:20.800
 So what do you find beautiful about this game?

1:04:20.800 --> 1:04:25.800
 Is it the attacking chess and just the asymmetry of it?

1:04:27.120 --> 1:04:28.920
 It's the asymmetry.

1:04:28.920 --> 1:04:32.440
 And it's the fact that this is the dream

1:04:32.440 --> 1:04:34.040
 for the King's Indian,

1:04:34.040 --> 1:04:36.320
 where you're able to get a beautiful attack.

1:04:36.320 --> 1:04:40.100
 And there was also those two really nice sacrifices

1:04:40.100 --> 1:04:43.560
 where Black just continuously kept putting pressure

1:04:43.560 --> 1:04:45.680
 on White's King to the point where he was able

1:04:45.680 --> 1:04:47.100
 to win material.

1:04:47.100 --> 1:04:50.120
 And the best part of it is that if the attack didn't work

1:04:50.120 --> 1:04:52.280
 out, Black would have been completely lost.

1:04:53.560 --> 1:04:54.960
 How often does that happen, by the way?

1:04:54.960 --> 1:04:56.360
 Like as an attacking player,

1:04:56.360 --> 1:04:59.780
 how often do you put yourself in the position of like,

1:04:59.780 --> 1:05:01.760
 I'm screwed unless this works out?

1:05:01.760 --> 1:05:04.080
 In online chess more than I should.

1:05:04.080 --> 1:05:05.760
 And it's usually when I sacrifice,

1:05:05.760 --> 1:05:08.440
 I know it's either gonna work or I'm lost.

1:05:09.560 --> 1:05:13.520
 And those are the most fun positions to play usually.

1:05:13.520 --> 1:05:15.920
 But in tournaments, if you're doing a sacrifice,

1:05:15.920 --> 1:05:18.640
 you're playing it with 100% confidence

1:05:18.640 --> 1:05:20.580
 because you're taking the time to calculate it.

1:05:20.580 --> 1:05:22.200
 But yeah, when you have three minutes,

1:05:22.200 --> 1:05:23.040
 you don't have time.

1:05:23.040 --> 1:05:25.600
 So you take a whim and you follow your intuition

1:05:25.600 --> 1:05:27.040
 and you find out later.

1:05:27.040 --> 1:05:29.380
 Or you're very confident it'll work

1:05:29.380 --> 1:05:31.540
 and you haven't calculated all the way until the end,

1:05:31.540 --> 1:05:34.400
 but you've calculated to the point where you have enough

1:05:34.400 --> 1:05:35.640
 in exchange for the sack

1:05:35.640 --> 1:05:37.880
 and you think you could play that position.

1:05:37.880 --> 1:05:41.320
 How do you train chess these days?

1:05:41.320 --> 1:05:44.060
 What's, do you practice?

1:05:44.060 --> 1:05:45.800
 Do you do deliberate practice?

1:05:45.800 --> 1:05:47.360
 I mean, you're in this tough position

1:05:47.360 --> 1:05:50.640
 because you're also a creator and educator and entertainer.

1:05:50.640 --> 1:05:54.680
 So do you try to put in time of like daily practice?

1:05:55.680 --> 1:06:00.360
 I don't train chess anymore when I'm focusing on creating.

1:06:00.360 --> 1:06:02.920
 I do if I'm preparing for a tournament.

1:06:02.920 --> 1:06:04.080
 But back in the day,

1:06:04.080 --> 1:06:07.200
 I would train very seriously for tournaments.

1:06:07.200 --> 1:06:10.880
 And the way it would work is I do opening preparation

1:06:10.880 --> 1:06:12.040
 for a specific tournament

1:06:12.040 --> 1:06:13.840
 because that's when you really need to have

1:06:13.840 --> 1:06:15.480
 those lines memorized

1:06:15.480 --> 1:06:17.760
 and you could also prepare for specific opponents.

1:06:17.760 --> 1:06:20.840
 And I would do tactics to make sure I stay sharp.

1:06:20.840 --> 1:06:23.120
 So those were the two things I would do every single day

1:06:23.120 --> 1:06:25.120
 for a tournament and then mix up the rest

1:06:25.120 --> 1:06:26.420
 with like maybe some end games,

1:06:26.420 --> 1:06:28.080
 maybe some positional chess.

1:06:28.080 --> 1:06:30.680
 So what does tactics preparation looks like?

1:06:30.680 --> 1:06:34.880
 Do you do like a puzzle, like a random puzzle thing?

1:06:34.880 --> 1:06:36.760
 Yeah, I would just train puzzles

1:06:36.760 --> 1:06:39.760
 for at least like 30 to 60 minutes or books.

1:06:39.760 --> 1:06:41.020
 And sometimes you were,

1:06:41.020 --> 1:06:42.760
 and there's different kinds of puzzles.

1:06:42.760 --> 1:06:44.780
 One you could train for pattern recognition

1:06:44.780 --> 1:06:46.880
 where you're supposed to go through them very quickly.

1:06:46.880 --> 1:06:48.680
 And that's just so that when you're playing the game,

1:06:48.680 --> 1:06:49.740
 if your mind is tired,

1:06:49.740 --> 1:06:51.920
 it's still keeping track of things

1:06:51.920 --> 1:06:53.440
 a little bit more easily.

1:06:53.440 --> 1:06:56.160
 And then there's where you're practicing your combination

1:06:56.160 --> 1:06:58.420
 and those sometimes take like 20 minutes to find

1:06:58.420 --> 1:07:00.480
 because you have to just calculate a lot.

1:07:00.480 --> 1:07:01.720
 And it's more like making sure

1:07:01.720 --> 1:07:03.020
 that you've trained with that muscle.

1:07:03.020 --> 1:07:06.360
 But Andrea is actually very good at finding ways

1:07:06.360 --> 1:07:09.320
 to balance and still study while also doing content.

1:07:09.320 --> 1:07:11.680
 Yeah, so what, you're able to do both?

1:07:11.680 --> 1:07:12.680
 That's the hard thing.

1:07:12.680 --> 1:07:14.760
 I was getting very irritated with content

1:07:14.760 --> 1:07:16.280
 because I'm very competitive.

1:07:16.280 --> 1:07:18.560
 I don't like playing chess if I'm losing.

1:07:18.560 --> 1:07:20.260
 And if you're talking and entertaining,

1:07:20.260 --> 1:07:22.560
 you're gonna be losing more games than winning.

1:07:22.560 --> 1:07:24.800
 So then I started doing more training streams

1:07:24.800 --> 1:07:27.040
 where I'd bring on my coach.

1:07:27.040 --> 1:07:28.940
 And one of the things that I wanted to add

1:07:28.940 --> 1:07:30.600
 to Alex's training repertoire.

1:07:30.600 --> 1:07:34.760
 So I would do daily puzzles every time I'm streaming,

1:07:34.760 --> 1:07:37.600
 which helped me a lot, even if it's like,

1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:40.460
 there's this thing on chess.com called Puzzle Rush,

1:07:40.460 --> 1:07:41.500
 where you have three minutes

1:07:41.500 --> 1:07:43.400
 and you just do puzzle after puzzle

1:07:43.400 --> 1:07:45.540
 where they get incrementally harder.

1:07:45.540 --> 1:07:46.960
 And it's just a really good way

1:07:46.960 --> 1:07:48.360
 to build your pattern recognition,

1:07:48.360 --> 1:07:49.780
 especially when you're rusty.

1:07:49.780 --> 1:07:51.520
 So I would do that till I hit a high score

1:07:51.520 --> 1:07:52.860
 and I wouldn't play any blitz

1:07:52.860 --> 1:07:55.000
 until I hit the score that I want.

1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:59.000
 But that's kind of more like the fun part of chess studying.

1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:02.840
 The very important one is actually analyzing your losses

1:08:02.840 --> 1:08:04.480
 in your tournament games.

1:08:04.480 --> 1:08:07.560
 And first you sit and you look through your mistake yourself

1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:10.120
 and try to see if you can find the better moves.

1:08:10.120 --> 1:08:12.440
 And then that's when you would check over with a computer

1:08:12.440 --> 1:08:13.920
 to see if you're right.

1:08:13.920 --> 1:08:16.800
 So game analysis is also very important, which I try to do.

1:08:16.800 --> 1:08:18.160
 I remember to give a shout out,

1:08:18.160 --> 1:08:19.680
 I listened to a couple of episodes

1:08:19.680 --> 1:08:24.040
 of the Perpetual Chess Podcast, which is pretty good.

1:08:24.040 --> 1:08:27.080
 But whatever I listened to, I remember the,

1:08:27.080 --> 1:08:32.080
 it's, I think they really focus on like teaching people.

1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:35.080
 How to train.

1:08:35.080 --> 1:08:37.440
 Yeah, how to play, how to train, all that kind of stuff.

1:08:37.440 --> 1:08:41.640
 They do like, yeah, I'm looking now, adult improver.

1:08:41.640 --> 1:08:46.640
 So basically like how do regular noobs get better at chess?

1:08:46.800 --> 1:08:50.060
 One of the things that, one of the person that said,

1:08:50.060 --> 1:08:52.880
 I think he was the grandmaster, but he said,

1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:56.180
 to maximize the amount of time you spend every day of like,

1:08:56.180 --> 1:08:58.280
 basically as you were saying, like suffering.

1:08:58.280 --> 1:09:01.320
 So like you, it's not about the,

1:09:01.320 --> 1:09:02.960
 like you should be thinking.

1:09:02.960 --> 1:09:04.640
 You should be doing calculating.

1:09:04.640 --> 1:09:06.240
 So it's the opposite of what Magnus said.

1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:08.560
 Like you should be doing a lot of time.

1:09:08.560 --> 1:09:10.180
 It doesn't matter what the puzzle is

1:09:10.180 --> 1:09:11.680
 or whatever the hell you're doing,

1:09:11.680 --> 1:09:14.680
 but you should be like doing that difficult calculation.

1:09:14.680 --> 1:09:15.680
 That's how you get better.

1:09:15.680 --> 1:09:17.440
 Yeah, it really depends what you're training.

1:09:17.440 --> 1:09:18.780
 Cause I used to think the same,

1:09:18.780 --> 1:09:20.340
 but it depends what you're weaker at.

1:09:20.340 --> 1:09:22.040
 Cause if you're doing the really difficult puzzles,

1:09:22.040 --> 1:09:24.280
 you're training for like visualization

1:09:24.280 --> 1:09:27.400
 and calculating more moves ahead than you typically would,

1:09:27.400 --> 1:09:30.080
 which maybe you wouldn't get into that as often

1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:32.640
 in a regular game because typically you run into like

1:09:32.640 --> 1:09:35.800
 three to four tactics, which are actually the easier

1:09:35.800 --> 1:09:37.680
 and more fun ones to solve.

1:09:37.680 --> 1:09:39.240
 So it really depends.

1:09:39.240 --> 1:09:41.560
 And on top of that, as a hobbyist,

1:09:41.560 --> 1:09:43.680
 your motivation is very different

1:09:43.680 --> 1:09:45.520
 than when you're playing from a young age

1:09:45.520 --> 1:09:48.860
 and have pretty high competitive ambition.

1:09:48.860 --> 1:09:52.300
 And a lot of people who are new to chess,

1:09:52.300 --> 1:09:55.560
 you could basically work on anything and still improve.

1:09:55.560 --> 1:09:58.320
 So if you're focusing on something you like,

1:09:58.320 --> 1:09:59.880
 you're probably gonna stick to it more

1:09:59.880 --> 1:10:01.040
 and be more consistent,

1:10:01.040 --> 1:10:03.480
 which I think is more helpful longterm.

1:10:03.480 --> 1:10:08.320
 What was the most embarrassing loss of your career?

1:10:08.320 --> 1:10:09.840
 I had so many flashbacks,

1:10:09.840 --> 1:10:12.400
 but I'm so glad it's a question for Andrea.

1:10:12.400 --> 1:10:14.360
 I like that you specified.

1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:15.320
 You know, it's funny.

1:10:15.320 --> 1:10:16.160
 Cause.

1:10:16.160 --> 1:10:19.800
 I mean, because you said you're so competitive and like.

1:10:19.800 --> 1:10:20.640
 Yeah, no, no.

1:10:20.640 --> 1:10:22.560
 I could tell just even from the way you said it,

1:10:22.560 --> 1:10:24.560
 that like you hate losing.

1:10:24.560 --> 1:10:27.560
 Yeah, I mean, that was the reason I hated chess

1:10:27.560 --> 1:10:29.880
 in high school, cause it'd always be like,

1:10:29.880 --> 1:10:32.480
 but okay, there's many traumatizing losses

1:10:32.480 --> 1:10:34.880
 where it's like your top three, you're running for first.

1:10:34.880 --> 1:10:36.680
 And then you throw a game you shouldn't,

1:10:36.680 --> 1:10:40.300
 and this shouldn't hurt my ego as much as it does,

1:10:40.300 --> 1:10:42.280
 but it's always kids.

1:10:42.280 --> 1:10:44.000
 Or when I was a high school girl,

1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:46.520
 it's the younger boys who are really cocky.

1:10:46.520 --> 1:10:48.720
 And when they win, they start rubbing it in your face

1:10:48.720 --> 1:10:50.460
 and they're yawning and looking around

1:10:50.460 --> 1:10:53.560
 when like 90% of the game you were destroying them

1:10:53.560 --> 1:10:55.060
 and you had this one tiny mistake

1:10:55.060 --> 1:10:57.000
 and now their ego's huge.

1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:58.920
 But I'll never forget I was playing like

1:10:58.920 --> 1:11:01.400
 for a chess scholarship.

1:11:01.400 --> 1:11:04.300
 And it was tiebreaker for first,

1:11:04.300 --> 1:11:06.160
 and I think I lost to a 12 year old girl

1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:08.160
 who couldn't even use the scholarship,

1:11:08.160 --> 1:11:09.640
 but she beat me in one first place

1:11:09.640 --> 1:11:11.480
 and she got some other prize.

1:11:12.400 --> 1:11:13.960
 So yeah, I was losing to that little girl

1:11:13.960 --> 1:11:17.480
 who's literally like 2300 now, so makes sense.

1:11:17.480 --> 1:11:18.840
 Right, you keep telling yourself that.

1:11:18.840 --> 1:11:22.360
 What do you think, do you think Gasparro was feeling that

1:11:22.360 --> 1:11:24.560
 when he was playing 13 year old Magnus?

1:11:24.560 --> 1:11:26.080
 Like why?

1:11:26.080 --> 1:11:28.680
 As much as it's a beauty of the sport

1:11:28.680 --> 1:11:33.080
 that any age can be brilliant, any demographic, anything,

1:11:33.080 --> 1:11:34.440
 I feel like when you're adults

1:11:34.440 --> 1:11:36.280
 and you're paired against the kid,

1:11:36.280 --> 1:11:38.760
 it's just hard not to let it get to you.

1:11:38.760 --> 1:11:40.880
 And it depends, maybe if they're a really sweet kid,

1:11:40.880 --> 1:11:42.800
 but most of the times I play kids,

1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:43.920
 they're just really arrogant.

1:11:43.920 --> 1:11:45.800
 And I don't think they do it intentionally

1:11:45.800 --> 1:11:46.640
 because they're kids.

1:11:46.640 --> 1:11:48.240
 I mean, there is a certain etiquette thing

1:11:48.240 --> 1:11:51.160
 where like you said, yawning, and in general,

1:11:51.160 --> 1:11:52.000
 like it's not.

1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:53.520
 If they're kids, there's no etiquette.

1:11:53.520 --> 1:11:54.360
 Yeah, yeah.

1:11:54.360 --> 1:11:55.800
 They don't care.

1:11:55.800 --> 1:11:57.520
 Yeah, the kids traumatized me too.

1:11:57.520 --> 1:12:01.560
 I was playing in Vegas and it was not even my opponent.

1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:03.360
 It was the board next to me.

1:12:03.360 --> 1:12:07.320
 And the kid was at least 10 years old, 12 max,

1:12:07.320 --> 1:12:08.560
 and he was playing against an adult

1:12:08.560 --> 1:12:12.160
 and he takes out his hand and he starts doing a fake phone

1:12:12.160 --> 1:12:15.360
 to which the kid sitting across diagonally

1:12:15.360 --> 1:12:18.560
 picks up their banana and starts talking like it's a phone

1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:19.880
 and they're just mouthing words

1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:21.640
 while their two adult opponents

1:12:21.640 --> 1:12:23.360
 are thinking intensely at the game.

1:12:23.360 --> 1:12:26.640
 And then I see the adult look up, look at the kid,

1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:29.440
 just making banana phone and the despair in his eyes

1:12:29.440 --> 1:12:31.080
 as he sighs.

1:12:31.080 --> 1:12:31.920
 Yeah.

1:12:31.920 --> 1:12:33.280
 And they're not even doing it for trash talk.

1:12:33.280 --> 1:12:34.120
 No, no, no.

1:12:34.120 --> 1:12:34.960
 They're just bored.

1:12:34.960 --> 1:12:35.800
 They're just bored kids.

1:12:35.800 --> 1:12:36.920
 Yes, exactly.

1:12:36.920 --> 1:12:37.760
 What was the,

1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:41.360
 cause you play a bunch of people for your channel.

1:12:41.360 --> 1:12:43.480
 What was the most like memorable?

1:12:43.480 --> 1:12:46.080
 What's the most fun, most intense?

1:12:46.080 --> 1:12:47.080
 There's a bunch of fun ones.

1:12:47.080 --> 1:12:50.680
 You've played kids before, some trash talking kids.

1:12:50.680 --> 1:12:52.160
 That sounds great.

1:12:52.160 --> 1:12:53.760
 They trash talk kids.

1:12:53.760 --> 1:12:54.600
 Yeah.

1:12:54.600 --> 1:12:56.720
 Nothing like losing a 12 year old

1:12:56.720 --> 1:12:59.080
 who then starts doing a Fortnite dance.

1:12:59.080 --> 1:13:00.000
 Yeah.

1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:01.560
 So that actually happened?

1:13:01.560 --> 1:13:02.720
 That did happen.

1:13:02.720 --> 1:13:05.600
 He is a very young master.

1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:06.600
 I think he became master

1:13:06.600 --> 1:13:08.320
 when he was like nine years old or something.

1:13:08.320 --> 1:13:11.520
 And he's very good at chess and doing a lot of training,

1:13:11.520 --> 1:13:13.720
 but he's also incredibly good at trash talking.

1:13:13.720 --> 1:13:15.760
 And he beat me one game and he stood up

1:13:15.760 --> 1:13:17.760
 and he started doing the Fortnite dance.

1:13:18.960 --> 1:13:22.400
 So you gotta just swallow your pride in those moments.

1:13:22.400 --> 1:13:25.320
 What is that culture of like street chess players?

1:13:25.320 --> 1:13:27.720
 It seems pretty interesting.

1:13:27.720 --> 1:13:29.440
 Like, I don't know,

1:13:29.440 --> 1:13:31.640
 that seems to be celebrating the beauty of the game.

1:13:31.640 --> 1:13:34.360
 It's the trash talking, but also having fun with it,

1:13:34.360 --> 1:13:36.280
 but also taking it seriously.

1:13:36.280 --> 1:13:37.960
 And you've done a few of those.

1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:39.600
 Did you go to New York?

1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:42.280
 Yeah, in Union Square Park in Washington Square.

1:13:42.280 --> 1:13:43.920
 What was that like?

1:13:43.920 --> 1:13:46.000
 It's such a unique place.

1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:48.760
 I haven't seen it anywhere else in the US

1:13:48.760 --> 1:13:52.680
 where people are just professional chess hustlers,

1:13:52.680 --> 1:13:55.800
 even if they're not necessarily a top player,

1:13:55.800 --> 1:13:58.120
 but they play chess every single day.

1:13:58.120 --> 1:14:01.240
 And so many of them learn chess by themselves

1:14:01.240 --> 1:14:03.160
 and never had a professional coach.

1:14:03.160 --> 1:14:05.000
 So they are quite good at it.

1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:06.760
 They're also very tight knit.

1:14:06.760 --> 1:14:07.840
 They all know each other.

1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:09.360
 And it's a very social thing

1:14:09.360 --> 1:14:11.280
 where you're not just playing chess.

1:14:11.280 --> 1:14:13.520
 It's the experience of getting to know this person

1:14:13.520 --> 1:14:16.400
 who's very much a personality and they talk to you.

1:14:16.400 --> 1:14:18.080
 They could either give you tips

1:14:18.080 --> 1:14:20.320
 or they could be really chatty and talk to you during.

1:14:20.320 --> 1:14:24.040
 So it's a chess experience rather than just playing a game.

1:14:24.040 --> 1:14:26.160
 Do you tell them like what your rating is

1:14:26.160 --> 1:14:29.720
 or do you just let people, like both ways,

1:14:29.720 --> 1:14:31.960
 do you discover how good the person actually is?

1:14:31.960 --> 1:14:35.600
 Initially, I loved going and not telling people my rating

1:14:35.600 --> 1:14:39.040
 and just surprising them and winning games.

1:14:39.040 --> 1:14:41.720
 But now we've gone so many times that they just know us.

1:14:41.720 --> 1:14:43.400
 So we can't get away with it anymore.

1:14:43.400 --> 1:14:46.120
 One time, actually, I don't know if I should share this,

1:14:46.120 --> 1:14:49.160
 but one time we dressed up as grandmothers

1:14:49.160 --> 1:14:51.640
 and we had prosthetics on our face.

1:14:51.640 --> 1:14:54.240
 And I think they still recognized us.

1:14:54.240 --> 1:14:56.720
 Yeah, it's probably the, there's other components,

1:14:56.720 --> 1:14:58.600
 like probably the trash talk and all that kind of stuff.

1:14:58.600 --> 1:15:00.200
 Actually, no, it was funny.

1:15:00.200 --> 1:15:01.560
 We were talking like grandmothers,

1:15:01.560 --> 1:15:04.320
 but it was the way I held, it was the way I held them.

1:15:04.320 --> 1:15:06.800
 Grandmother talk like, back of my day.

1:15:06.800 --> 1:15:10.440
 No, no, no, no, no, no, we're not bringing this back.

1:15:10.440 --> 1:15:11.960
 We're not bringing this back.

1:15:11.960 --> 1:15:14.040
 Okay, what were your names, what were the code names?

1:15:14.040 --> 1:15:14.880
 Oh my God.

1:15:14.880 --> 1:15:19.000
 I think it was Edna, Edna, and I had a really,

1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:20.480
 I can't remember the other one.

1:15:20.480 --> 1:15:23.400
 But it was embarrassing because we were walking so slowly

1:15:23.400 --> 1:15:25.640
 and Andrea dropped her cane or something at one point

1:15:25.640 --> 1:15:27.840
 and then people in the park came to help her.

1:15:27.840 --> 1:15:29.680
 We felt so embarrassed.

1:15:29.680 --> 1:15:31.920
 But yeah, it was funny.

1:15:31.920 --> 1:15:33.240
 Cause they didn't know it was us

1:15:33.240 --> 1:15:35.640
 until he saw the way I reached for my pawn.

1:15:35.640 --> 1:15:38.520
 And he said, the way you held your pawn, I knew it was you.

1:15:38.520 --> 1:15:40.760
 It was like such a niche thing.

1:15:40.760 --> 1:15:42.560
 That was what blew the grandma cover.

1:15:42.560 --> 1:15:47.080
 Yeah, do you have a style of how you play physically?

1:15:47.080 --> 1:15:47.920
 Is that recognizable?

1:15:47.920 --> 1:15:51.000
 I didn't think we did until grandma went to play chess, but.

1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:53.080
 Yeah, I've never thought about that.

1:15:53.080 --> 1:15:56.280
 Yeah, I think our style is just trash talking now.

1:15:56.280 --> 1:15:59.360
 Style is very, if you're talking about style

1:15:59.360 --> 1:16:03.760
 on YouTube and Twitch, we definitely have a distinctive style.

1:16:03.760 --> 1:16:04.600
 What's that?

1:16:04.600 --> 1:16:06.960
 What's your distinctive, just talking shit?

1:16:06.960 --> 1:16:07.800
 Yes.

1:16:07.800 --> 1:16:09.240
 But not going too far.

1:16:09.240 --> 1:16:12.200
 No, no, definitely that's, definitely going to.

1:16:12.200 --> 1:16:14.080
 If it's us two against each other.

1:16:14.080 --> 1:16:16.680
 Oh, we trash talk each other so hard.

1:16:16.680 --> 1:16:17.520
 So brutally.

1:16:17.520 --> 1:16:18.760
 And I love looking at Andrea

1:16:18.760 --> 1:16:21.000
 and watching her little nose scrunch up

1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:22.880
 as she's annoyed and the satisfaction

1:16:22.880 --> 1:16:24.800
 I get when that happens.

1:16:24.800 --> 1:16:26.320
 How many times do you play against each other

1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:28.320
 on online publicly?

1:16:28.320 --> 1:16:29.960
 I think I've seen a couple of games.

1:16:29.960 --> 1:16:31.160
 We played a lot of times.

1:16:31.160 --> 1:16:33.400
 We try not to do it too often cause it's repetitive,

1:16:33.400 --> 1:16:35.880
 but every now and then when we haven't done it for a while,

1:16:35.880 --> 1:16:36.920
 we'll go at it again.

1:16:36.920 --> 1:16:37.760
 What do you mean repetitive?

1:16:37.760 --> 1:16:40.320
 Is that implied trash talk right there?

1:16:40.320 --> 1:16:42.800
 No, it just, we play similar openings.

1:16:42.800 --> 1:16:44.120
 So you just start seeing the same position too often.

1:16:44.120 --> 1:16:46.720
 It's the same opening against each other every time.

1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:48.240
 Andrea's really good at opening.

1:16:48.240 --> 1:16:50.080
 So I just start playing bad openings

1:16:50.080 --> 1:16:51.880
 to get her out of her preparation.

1:16:51.880 --> 1:16:53.680
 Cause I don't like opening theory very much.

1:16:53.680 --> 1:16:54.920
 I just like playing the game

1:16:54.920 --> 1:16:57.360
 and getting into middle games and end games.

1:16:57.360 --> 1:16:59.600
 But yeah, typically the only time we're playing each other

1:16:59.600 --> 1:17:01.040
 is when we're setting up in the park

1:17:01.040 --> 1:17:04.000
 and we don't have opponents yet and we need content.

1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:05.960
 So we just play each other until people show up.

1:17:05.960 --> 1:17:07.760
 But we always put stakes on the line,

1:17:07.760 --> 1:17:09.240
 which makes it very interesting.

1:17:09.240 --> 1:17:11.000
 Cause otherwise it wouldn't be fun to play each other

1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:11.840
 if there's no stakes.

1:17:11.840 --> 1:17:14.360
 Where's the most fun place you've played?

1:17:14.360 --> 1:17:15.440
 Is it New York?

1:17:15.440 --> 1:17:16.280
 I think so.

1:17:16.280 --> 1:17:19.720
 And it was actually when we set up in Times Square one night,

1:17:19.720 --> 1:17:22.720
 we just brought a table with us and chess.

1:17:22.720 --> 1:17:25.280
 And it's not even where people usually play chess,

1:17:25.280 --> 1:17:27.680
 but it was so lively.

1:17:27.680 --> 1:17:29.000
 There were all of the lights out

1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:31.600
 and so many people just kept stopping by to play chess.

1:17:31.600 --> 1:17:33.760
 And it was really one of my favorite streams.

1:17:33.760 --> 1:17:36.800
 It's just the opposite of like the classical chess world.

1:17:36.800 --> 1:17:37.720
 It's super loud.

1:17:37.720 --> 1:17:39.040
 There's music, there's cars,

1:17:39.040 --> 1:17:40.200
 there's street dancers,

1:17:40.200 --> 1:17:42.360
 even some naked people walking around

1:17:42.360 --> 1:17:44.480
 who we had to be careful not to get banned.

1:17:44.480 --> 1:17:47.160
 But I honestly really liked the chaotic environments

1:17:47.160 --> 1:17:48.360
 for chess games.

1:17:48.360 --> 1:17:49.280
 Cause I think it's a good way

1:17:49.280 --> 1:17:51.040
 to break more into the mainstream culture

1:17:51.040 --> 1:17:52.680
 and make it entertaining and appealing

1:17:52.680 --> 1:17:55.320
 to anyone who doesn't know anything about chess.

1:17:55.320 --> 1:17:56.160
 So that's the way.

1:17:56.160 --> 1:17:57.600
 And also in an authentic way,

1:17:57.600 --> 1:17:59.960
 because it's what we really like about chess

1:17:59.960 --> 1:18:01.480
 when you're just enjoying the game,

1:18:01.480 --> 1:18:03.240
 but also the atmosphere

1:18:03.240 --> 1:18:05.360
 and the people who you're playing with.

1:18:05.360 --> 1:18:07.800
 And that's one of the things that I think you see less

1:18:07.800 --> 1:18:10.840
 when you're just thinking of chess as a competitive thing.

1:18:12.040 --> 1:18:14.440
 You've mentioned a few other games,

1:18:14.440 --> 1:18:16.160
 like the Bobby Fischer games,

1:18:16.160 --> 1:18:17.200
 the Candidates match,

1:18:17.200 --> 1:18:19.240
 the game of the century,

1:18:19.240 --> 1:18:21.280
 which I feel like is a weird game

1:18:21.280 --> 1:18:22.440
 to call the game of the century

1:18:22.440 --> 1:18:24.880
 when there's still like a few decades left in the century.

1:18:24.880 --> 1:18:25.720
 But yeah.

1:18:25.720 --> 1:18:27.040
 I mean, it wasn't an official thing.

1:18:27.040 --> 1:18:28.560
 It was just the chess journalist.

1:18:28.560 --> 1:18:29.960
 It's just like made on a chess article.

1:18:29.960 --> 1:18:31.320
 But it's stuck if you look on.

1:18:31.320 --> 1:18:32.160
 Yeah, no, it did stick.

1:18:32.160 --> 1:18:33.000
 Again, Wikipedia.

1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:34.720
 This is all I do research wise.

1:18:34.720 --> 1:18:36.960
 Because there's,

1:18:36.960 --> 1:18:41.560
 so that particular one was a 13 year old Fischer

1:18:41.560 --> 1:18:44.000
 and he did a queen sacrifice.

1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:47.280
 I wonder, there's that movie searching for Bobby Fischer.

1:18:47.280 --> 1:18:48.280
 Was that related?

1:18:48.280 --> 1:18:51.000
 Cause didn't they have a young somebody

1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:52.720
 who's supposed to be kind of like Bobby Fischer

1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:54.520
 played by Josh Waitzkin.

1:18:54.520 --> 1:18:57.520
 Yeah, I think he ended up being an international master.

1:18:57.520 --> 1:18:59.080
 It wasn't based on Bobby Fischer.

1:18:59.080 --> 1:19:00.280
 It was based on another player,

1:19:00.280 --> 1:19:02.600
 but I liked how they told it through the lens

1:19:02.600 --> 1:19:04.800
 of being inspired by Bobby Fischer.

1:19:04.800 --> 1:19:05.920
 Do you remember that game?

1:19:05.920 --> 1:19:08.200
 Like why do you think it was dubbed the game of the century?

1:19:08.200 --> 1:19:10.360
 It was just journalists being like.

1:19:10.360 --> 1:19:12.720
 I think part of it was the atmosphere

1:19:12.720 --> 1:19:15.080
 where you have the US junior champion

1:19:15.080 --> 1:19:17.240
 who's this 13 year old nobody.

1:19:17.240 --> 1:19:19.480
 And it's the first time he's playing

1:19:19.480 --> 1:19:21.240
 in a very competitive landscape

1:19:21.240 --> 1:19:23.840
 against some of the top American players.

1:19:23.840 --> 1:19:26.840
 And he goes up against an international master.

1:19:26.840 --> 1:19:29.600
 So somebody who's a lot stronger than he is

1:19:29.600 --> 1:19:32.840
 who's played in Olympiads for the American team.

1:19:32.840 --> 1:19:34.560
 He's having a bad tournament,

1:19:34.560 --> 1:19:36.240
 but then he has this one game

1:19:36.240 --> 1:19:40.000
 where he just shows off his tactical prowess

1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:41.640
 and plays incredibly well.

1:19:41.640 --> 1:19:43.440
 And I don't know if this is true,

1:19:43.440 --> 1:19:44.960
 but in the paper clippings of it,

1:19:44.960 --> 1:19:47.200
 they'd say things like grandmasters were by the board

1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:48.720
 and they would say things like,

1:19:48.720 --> 1:19:51.080
 oh, Bobby is lost in this position.

1:19:51.080 --> 1:19:51.920
 What is he doing?

1:19:51.920 --> 1:19:53.200
 But there's this 13 year old kid

1:19:53.200 --> 1:19:55.120
 who's just playing incredibly well.

1:19:55.120 --> 1:19:56.440
 And then that also happened

1:19:56.440 --> 1:20:01.160
 before Bobby's started really rapidly improving at chess.

1:20:01.160 --> 1:20:02.200
 Not that people knew that,

1:20:02.200 --> 1:20:03.920
 but he kind of seemed like a rising star.

1:20:03.920 --> 1:20:05.320
 So I think the game was beautiful,

1:20:05.320 --> 1:20:08.480
 but I also think the idea of a 13 year old kid

1:20:08.480 --> 1:20:09.560
 coming out from nowhere

1:20:09.560 --> 1:20:12.480
 and beating a top American player was very fascinating.

1:20:12.480 --> 1:20:13.720
 And there was aggressive chess

1:20:13.720 --> 1:20:15.920
 and it was interesting ideas.

1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:18.120
 Yeah, taking big risks.

1:20:18.120 --> 1:20:20.120
 It's cool to see a 13 year old do that.

1:20:21.320 --> 1:20:22.600
 What about the,

1:20:22.600 --> 1:20:27.320
 you mentioned that his match against Mark Taimano

1:20:27.320 --> 1:20:29.440
 from their 71 candidates match

1:20:29.440 --> 1:20:31.000
 was interesting in some way.

1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:32.520
 Why is it interesting to you?

1:20:33.800 --> 1:20:36.880
 Move 45, I'm looking at some notes.

1:20:36.880 --> 1:20:38.840
 This is with the Bishop E3.

1:20:38.840 --> 1:20:41.120
 I think I know which one you're talking about.

1:20:41.120 --> 1:20:43.720
 It's, I wouldn't say,

1:20:43.720 --> 1:20:45.600
 a lot of these games on these lists

1:20:45.600 --> 1:20:48.040
 I think are really great combinations

1:20:48.040 --> 1:20:50.760
 that when tactics come into play,

1:20:50.760 --> 1:20:52.320
 which is what we're talking about.

1:20:52.320 --> 1:20:56.000
 But they're very good at exemplifying lessons.

1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:58.280
 This is why you study famous games.

1:20:58.280 --> 1:21:00.880
 So you can apply these lessons to your own games.

1:21:00.880 --> 1:21:02.760
 And I think the main takeaway for this one

1:21:02.760 --> 1:21:04.800
 was they're punishing their opponent

1:21:04.800 --> 1:21:07.560
 from steering away from opening principles,

1:21:07.560 --> 1:21:11.200
 which is something that we learned a little earlier

1:21:11.200 --> 1:21:14.120
 where he delayed the development of his King

1:21:14.120 --> 1:21:17.160
 and put his Queen out a little bit too exposed.

1:21:17.160 --> 1:21:19.920
 So Bobby Fisher immediately punished that.

1:21:19.920 --> 1:21:22.320
 And then there was just like a beautiful combination

1:21:22.320 --> 1:21:25.840
 where it was like a 12 in a row perfect moves,

1:21:25.840 --> 1:21:27.720
 which was a tactic, just winning the game.

1:21:27.720 --> 1:21:30.400
 But it only came from punishing those mistakes.

1:21:30.400 --> 1:21:32.400
 The mistake being bringing the Queen out?

1:21:32.400 --> 1:21:33.240
 Bringing the Queen out

1:21:33.240 --> 1:21:35.960
 and yeah, not castling your King right away.

1:21:35.960 --> 1:21:37.920
 And these were just like opening principles

1:21:37.920 --> 1:21:39.320
 that now they're written in books,

1:21:39.320 --> 1:21:42.360
 but for books you would study these principles

1:21:42.360 --> 1:21:43.480
 by studying games.

1:21:45.440 --> 1:21:48.160
 And also, I'm looking at some notes,

1:21:48.160 --> 1:21:50.120
 his dominance during the candidate's turn

1:21:50.120 --> 1:21:52.200
 was unprecedented.

1:21:52.200 --> 1:21:54.600
 He swept two top grandmasters.

1:21:54.600 --> 1:21:57.680
 I mean, that guy's meteoric rise is incredible.

1:21:57.680 --> 1:22:01.440
 Sad that I think at whatever in his 20s,

1:22:01.440 --> 1:22:03.320
 he then quit chess.

1:22:03.320 --> 1:22:07.200
 One has to wonder where he could have gone.

1:22:07.200 --> 1:22:11.200
 Yeah, it is sad that we lost such a brilliant mind

1:22:11.200 --> 1:22:12.040
 so early on.

1:22:12.040 --> 1:22:15.160
 And it's also sad, I think kind of what ended up happening

1:22:15.160 --> 1:22:18.120
 in his life and the slowly going crazier.

1:22:18.120 --> 1:22:19.520
 Is there some aspect of chess

1:22:19.520 --> 1:22:23.200
 that opens the door to crazy?

1:22:23.200 --> 1:22:26.640
 Like how challenging it is on you,

1:22:26.640 --> 1:22:30.600
 the stress, the anxiety of it, the isolation.

1:22:30.600 --> 1:22:31.760
 And being alone.

1:22:31.760 --> 1:22:32.600
 Yeah.

1:22:32.600 --> 1:22:33.720
 It's a very lonely sport.

1:22:33.720 --> 1:22:36.760
 It is, even do you guys, since you both play it,

1:22:36.760 --> 1:22:38.880
 it's still lonely, the experience of it?

1:22:38.880 --> 1:22:40.960
 It was when I was competing a lot.

1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:43.440
 I think the crazy part of it for me

1:22:43.440 --> 1:22:47.400
 was how obsessed you can get about a board game

1:22:47.400 --> 1:22:50.040
 where you're optimizing your entire life

1:22:50.040 --> 1:22:53.080
 to beat another person at pushing wooden pieces

1:22:53.080 --> 1:22:53.920
 across the board.

1:22:53.920 --> 1:22:57.040
 And it doesn't necessarily translate to other things.

1:22:57.040 --> 1:22:59.760
 And the fact that so many people spend so much

1:22:59.760 --> 1:23:01.040
 of their life on it,

1:23:01.040 --> 1:23:02.880
 but you can also spend so much of your life

1:23:02.880 --> 1:23:05.600
 because it's so deep and so interesting.

1:23:07.040 --> 1:23:09.600
 And I mean, I've definitely experienced moments

1:23:09.600 --> 1:23:13.440
 where I didn't want to do anything but chess.

1:23:13.440 --> 1:23:16.200
 And I had that before I went to college

1:23:16.200 --> 1:23:18.600
 where I just wanted to take a gap year and focus on chess

1:23:18.600 --> 1:23:21.720
 because I went to high school, we moved a lot,

1:23:21.720 --> 1:23:23.120
 there was always other things going on.

1:23:23.120 --> 1:23:26.680
 So I felt like I could never really focus on chess.

1:23:26.680 --> 1:23:29.600
 And the one time I could, by taking a gap year,

1:23:29.600 --> 1:23:32.000
 I ended up not doing because my parents really wanted me

1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:33.720
 to go to university right away.

1:23:33.720 --> 1:23:35.960
 But I think maybe if I had taken that gap year,

1:23:35.960 --> 1:23:37.600
 I don't know if I would have gone back to school.

1:23:37.600 --> 1:23:39.200
 So maybe it wasn't a bad thing.

1:23:39.200 --> 1:23:40.760
 I'd also say that's pretty universal.

1:23:40.760 --> 1:23:43.120
 I think if you want to be the best at anything you do

1:23:43.120 --> 1:23:45.320
 or any sport, you have to be that level of obsessed.

1:23:45.320 --> 1:23:47.680
 So I don't know if that's only chess.

1:23:47.680 --> 1:23:50.840
 Well, some things, some obsessions are more transferable

1:23:50.840 --> 1:23:53.720
 to a balanced social life.

1:23:53.720 --> 1:23:54.560
 That is true.

1:23:54.560 --> 1:23:55.400
 Like healthy development.

1:23:55.400 --> 1:23:58.520
 Yeah, chess is a lot less social than most other sports.

1:23:58.520 --> 1:24:01.960
 Yeah, there's something deeply isolating about this game.

1:24:01.960 --> 1:24:03.640
 I mean, the great chess players I've met,

1:24:03.640 --> 1:24:07.880
 I mean, it's really competitive too.

1:24:07.880 --> 1:24:12.880
 And there's something that you're almost nonstop paranoid

1:24:15.800 --> 1:24:18.840
 about blundering at every level.

1:24:18.840 --> 1:24:21.440
 And that develops a person who is really anxious

1:24:21.440 --> 1:24:26.240
 about losing versus someone who deeply enjoys perfection

1:24:26.240 --> 1:24:27.760
 or winning and so on.

1:24:27.760 --> 1:24:30.200
 It's just this constant paranoia about losing.

1:24:30.200 --> 1:24:35.200
 Maybe I'm misinterpreting it, but that creates huge amount

1:24:35.200 --> 1:24:38.360
 of stress over like thousands of games,

1:24:38.360 --> 1:24:41.000
 especially in a young person.

1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:44.720
 And that blundering is such a painful experience

1:24:44.720 --> 1:24:47.520
 because you could be playing a game that you've played

1:24:47.520 --> 1:24:52.040
 for five, six hours and you have one lapse in focus

1:24:52.040 --> 1:24:54.600
 and you blunder and you throw the entire game away.

1:24:54.600 --> 1:24:56.280
 And sometimes not just the entire game,

1:24:56.280 --> 1:24:57.280
 but the entire tournament.

1:24:57.280 --> 1:24:59.520
 Now you can't place or do anything anymore.

1:24:59.520 --> 1:25:02.920
 So you just feel those mistakes so strongly.

1:25:02.920 --> 1:25:06.320
 Yeah, there's no one to blame but yourself.

1:25:06.320 --> 1:25:08.120
 Are you guys hard on yourself?

1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:10.600
 Have you been about losing?

1:25:10.600 --> 1:25:13.800
 Like before you became super famous for streaming

1:25:13.800 --> 1:25:15.240
 where you could be like, well, fuck this,

1:25:15.240 --> 1:25:17.120
 at least I can have fun playing.

1:25:17.120 --> 1:25:20.480
 So I was really hard on myself and I went to play

1:25:20.480 --> 1:25:22.440
 a tournament in Canada to try to qualify

1:25:22.440 --> 1:25:24.600
 for the Olympiad team.

1:25:24.600 --> 1:25:28.040
 And I was like, well, I'm an adult now.

1:25:28.040 --> 1:25:30.880
 I'm not gonna feel emotional if I lose.

1:25:30.880 --> 1:25:33.440
 And then I got there on the first day.

1:25:33.440 --> 1:25:37.440
 I think I was ranked like fourth in Canada for females.

1:25:38.560 --> 1:25:40.040
 How long ago was this?

1:25:40.040 --> 1:25:43.440
 This was like earlier in the year actually.

1:25:43.440 --> 1:25:46.440
 And I go and I lose to somebody lower rated

1:25:46.440 --> 1:25:47.840
 on the first day.

1:25:47.840 --> 1:25:49.800
 And I think it was because I blundered

1:25:49.800 --> 1:25:51.560
 and I went back to my room and I was like,

1:25:51.560 --> 1:25:52.680
 I am not an adult.

1:25:52.680 --> 1:25:54.720
 I'm not eating, I'm not leaving this room.

1:25:54.720 --> 1:25:56.800
 I feel terrible and I know I shouldn't,

1:25:56.800 --> 1:25:59.640
 but it just cuts so deep.

1:25:59.640 --> 1:26:02.280
 And then I actually ended up qualifying

1:26:02.280 --> 1:26:04.760
 for the Olympiad team, but I didn't wanna play

1:26:04.760 --> 1:26:06.400
 because I didn't have enough time to train

1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:08.480
 and the losses are so painful that I was like,

1:26:08.480 --> 1:26:09.960
 it's not worth it.

1:26:09.960 --> 1:26:12.560
 Yeah, in high school and growing up,

1:26:12.560 --> 1:26:14.280
 I just remember weekends.

1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:16.680
 And I think being competitive in any sport,

1:26:16.680 --> 1:26:18.200
 again, probably people relate to this,

1:26:18.200 --> 1:26:20.040
 which is like spending weekends crying.

1:26:20.040 --> 1:26:22.120
 And even like Alex said, like punishing yourself

1:26:22.120 --> 1:26:23.920
 because you're disappointed in yourself

1:26:23.920 --> 1:26:25.400
 because you fight so hard and you prepare

1:26:25.400 --> 1:26:29.280
 and you study and you're like, oh, yeah.

1:26:29.280 --> 1:26:32.840
 But that's once again on the bright side though,

1:26:32.840 --> 1:26:37.120
 when you're studying so hard and after like a four hour game

1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:40.160
 and you actually are on the opposite end and you win,

1:26:40.160 --> 1:26:43.720
 you feel like such a huge rush of dopamine and serotonin

1:26:43.720 --> 1:26:45.320
 and you're like on a high from the wind.

1:26:45.320 --> 1:26:47.680
 So there's also plus sides or you can turn this around.

1:26:47.680 --> 1:26:50.380
 But yeah, like Alex said, like losing

1:26:50.380 --> 1:26:53.000
 after preparing for something and fighting on hours

1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:54.760
 and hours is the worst feeling in the world.

1:26:54.760 --> 1:26:58.200
 Did you ever get anything like that with martial arts?

1:26:58.200 --> 1:27:00.000
 Yeah, so, you know, wrestling,

1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:02.360
 I wrestled all through high school and middle school.

1:27:02.360 --> 1:27:03.760
 Definitely, so it's an individual sport.

1:27:03.760 --> 1:27:05.720
 I did a lot of individual sport, tennis,

1:27:05.720 --> 1:27:07.160
 those kinds of things.

1:27:07.160 --> 1:27:09.680
 But I think even with wrestling and tennis,

1:27:09.680 --> 1:27:11.480
 you're still on a team.

1:27:11.480 --> 1:27:14.800
 You can still like, there's still a comradery there.

1:27:14.800 --> 1:27:16.960
 I feel like with chess, especially you go on your own

1:27:16.960 --> 1:27:20.760
 with the tournaments, like you really are alone.

1:27:20.760 --> 1:27:23.160
 But I mean, I always personally just had

1:27:23.160 --> 1:27:25.360
 like a very self critical mind in general.

1:27:25.360 --> 1:27:26.200
 I would not.

1:27:26.200 --> 1:27:29.560
 It's one of the reasons I decided not to play chess

1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:32.480
 because I think when I was really young,

1:27:32.480 --> 1:27:37.480
 I met somebody who was able to play blindfold chess.

1:27:38.360 --> 1:27:39.600
 They were teaching me, they were laying in there

1:27:39.600 --> 1:27:42.580
 on the couch, trashed, drinking and smoking.

1:27:42.580 --> 1:27:43.420
 And there were.

1:27:43.420 --> 1:27:44.240
 Sounds like a Russian.

1:27:44.240 --> 1:27:45.840
 Yeah, exactly.

1:27:45.840 --> 1:27:48.880
 There are now a faculty somewhere in the United States.

1:27:48.880 --> 1:27:49.880
 I forget where.

1:27:49.880 --> 1:27:54.040
 But he making jokes, talking to others

1:27:54.040 --> 1:27:56.600
 and he would move the pieces, like he would yell

1:27:56.600 --> 1:27:57.500
 across the room.

1:27:58.480 --> 1:28:03.480
 And I remember thinking that if a person is able to do that,

1:28:04.060 --> 1:28:08.040
 then that kind of world you can live in inside your mind

1:28:08.040 --> 1:28:09.280
 that becomes the chessboard.

1:28:09.280 --> 1:28:12.520
 To me, that meant like the chessboard is not just out here.

1:28:12.520 --> 1:28:14.960
 It could be in here and you could do these beautiful,

1:28:14.960 --> 1:28:17.840
 you can create these beautiful patterns in your mind.

1:28:17.840 --> 1:28:22.800
 I thought like, I had such a strong pull towards that

1:28:22.800 --> 1:28:26.520
 where I had to decide either I'm gonna dedicate everything

1:28:26.520 --> 1:28:28.400
 to this or not.

1:28:29.360 --> 1:28:30.760
 You can't do half assed.

1:28:30.760 --> 1:28:35.000
 And then that's when I decided to walk away from it

1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:37.280
 because I had so much other beautiful things in my life.

1:28:37.280 --> 1:28:38.520
 I loved mathematics.

1:28:38.520 --> 1:28:40.880
 I loved, just everything was beautiful to me.

1:28:40.880 --> 1:28:44.680
 I thought chess would pull me all in.

1:28:44.680 --> 1:28:47.520
 And there was nothing like it, I think,

1:28:47.520 --> 1:28:49.560
 in my whole life since then.

1:28:49.560 --> 1:28:52.360
 I think it's such a dangerous addiction.

1:28:52.360 --> 1:28:54.920
 It's such a beautiful addiction, but it's a dangerous one,

1:28:54.920 --> 1:28:56.320
 depending on what your mind is like.

1:28:56.320 --> 1:28:58.920
 It reminds me of something I thought of

1:28:58.920 --> 1:29:01.360
 before I stopped competing as much.

1:29:01.360 --> 1:29:03.360
 And I'd look at people and think,

1:29:03.360 --> 1:29:06.920
 imagine being so intelligent that you could become

1:29:06.920 --> 1:29:10.160
 a grandmaster and yet only spending the rest of your life

1:29:10.160 --> 1:29:11.520
 being a grandmaster.

1:29:11.520 --> 1:29:13.840
 Because it's one of those things where it does require

1:29:13.840 --> 1:29:16.640
 a lot of mental power, but by doing chess,

1:29:16.640 --> 1:29:19.720
 you're not gonna be able to explore other subjects deeply.

1:29:20.600 --> 1:29:21.440
 Yeah.

1:29:21.440 --> 1:29:24.000
 And not in a way that is bad necessarily,

1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:27.400
 more an admiration and wondering what else could have been

1:29:27.400 --> 1:29:29.720
 because I've just seen people get to these levels

1:29:29.720 --> 1:29:31.680
 of obsession where it's all they wanna do.

1:29:31.680 --> 1:29:34.120
 And they're grandmasters, but they're not even top players.

1:29:34.120 --> 1:29:36.000
 So they're never gonna make a living out of it.

1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:38.680
 They'll make like maybe 30, 40K a year max.

1:29:38.680 --> 1:29:40.680
 They can't even focus on their competitive chess

1:29:40.680 --> 1:29:44.240
 because they have to supplement it by teaching

1:29:44.240 --> 1:29:45.400
 and doing things they don't like.

1:29:45.400 --> 1:29:48.000
 And it's just because of how strong of an obsession

1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:52.520
 it can be because it truly is very intellectually rewarding.

1:29:52.520 --> 1:29:54.320
 And I think that's what people are addicted to

1:29:54.320 --> 1:29:55.960
 in the self improvement, but you can get that

1:29:55.960 --> 1:29:58.080
 from a lot of other things as well.

1:29:58.080 --> 1:30:00.440
 Well, I think for me, what I was inspired by

1:30:00.440 --> 1:30:03.400
 that stuck with me is that a human being

1:30:03.400 --> 1:30:08.400
 could be so good at one thing.

1:30:09.160 --> 1:30:10.000
 Right.

1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:11.840
 To me, that person on the couch drinking and so on,

1:30:11.840 --> 1:30:14.960
 I assumed he was the best chess player in the world.

1:30:14.960 --> 1:30:18.200
 Like to be able to play inside your head,

1:30:18.200 --> 1:30:22.320
 it just felt like a feat that's incredible.

1:30:22.320 --> 1:30:24.440
 And so I fell in love with the idea

1:30:24.440 --> 1:30:26.160
 that I hope to be something like that

1:30:26.160 --> 1:30:27.720
 in my life at something.

1:30:27.720 --> 1:30:31.320
 It would be pretty cool to be really good at one thing.

1:30:31.320 --> 1:30:34.480
 And like life in some sense is a search for the things

1:30:34.480 --> 1:30:36.960
 that you could be that good at.

1:30:36.960 --> 1:30:38.680
 I didn't even think about like how much money

1:30:38.680 --> 1:30:40.400
 does it make or any of that.

1:30:40.400 --> 1:30:42.560
 It's can I fall in love with something

1:30:42.560 --> 1:30:46.840
 and make it a life pursuit where I can be damn good at it.

1:30:46.840 --> 1:30:50.560
 And being damn good at it is the source of enjoyment.

1:30:50.560 --> 1:30:55.200
 Not like not to win because you want to win a tournament

1:30:55.200 --> 1:30:58.720
 or win because like you just want to be better

1:30:58.720 --> 1:30:59.560
 at somebody else.

1:30:59.560 --> 1:31:01.440
 No, it's for the beauty of the game itself

1:31:01.440 --> 1:31:03.480
 or the beauty of the activity itself.

1:31:03.480 --> 1:31:05.720
 And then you realize that that's one of the compelling

1:31:05.720 --> 1:31:06.560
 things about chess.

1:31:06.560 --> 1:31:10.440
 It is a game with rules and you can win.

1:31:10.440 --> 1:31:12.920
 If you want to be really damn good in some aspect

1:31:12.920 --> 1:31:17.920
 of life like that, it's a harder and weirder pursuit.

1:31:19.280 --> 1:31:20.960
 Don't you feel like you kind of did that

1:31:20.960 --> 1:31:24.120
 with computer science or AI related things?

1:31:24.120 --> 1:31:27.440
 Like getting that level of damn good.

1:31:27.440 --> 1:31:31.720
 That's one of the cool things about AI and robotics

1:31:31.720 --> 1:31:34.080
 or intellectual pursuits or scientific pursuits

1:31:34.080 --> 1:31:36.440
 is you can spend until you're 80 doing it.

1:31:36.440 --> 1:31:37.920
 So I'm in the early days of that.

1:31:37.920 --> 1:31:40.760
 One of the reasons I came to Texas,

1:31:40.760 --> 1:31:43.560
 one of the reasons I didn't want to pursue

1:31:43.560 --> 1:31:48.560
 an academic career at MIT is I want to build a company.

1:31:49.040 --> 1:31:52.760
 And so I'm in the early days of that AI company.

1:31:52.760 --> 1:31:56.680
 And so it's an open world to see if I'm actually

1:31:56.680 --> 1:31:57.640
 going to be good at it.

1:31:57.640 --> 1:32:01.160
 But the thing that's there that I've been cognizant

1:32:01.160 --> 1:32:03.160
 of my whole life is that I have a passion for it.

1:32:03.160 --> 1:32:06.640
 Something within me draws me to that thing.

1:32:06.640 --> 1:32:09.120
 And you have to listen to that, to that voice.

1:32:09.120 --> 1:32:13.720
 So with chess, you're fucked unless you like early on

1:32:13.720 --> 1:32:16.240
 are really training really hard.

1:32:16.240 --> 1:32:18.040
 I think life is more forgiving.

1:32:19.280 --> 1:32:22.600
 You can be world class at a thing

1:32:22.600 --> 1:32:25.640
 after making a lot of mistakes.

1:32:25.640 --> 1:32:28.960
 And after spending the first few decades of your life

1:32:28.960 --> 1:32:30.640
 doing something completely different.

1:32:30.640 --> 1:32:34.040
 And chess, it's like an Olympic sport.

1:32:34.040 --> 1:32:37.600
 Like there's no, perfection is a requirement,

1:32:37.600 --> 1:32:38.620
 is a necessity.

1:32:39.720 --> 1:32:42.400
 What do you think is that pursuit for you?

1:32:42.400 --> 1:32:44.440
 Like why did you decide to stream?

1:32:45.560 --> 1:32:46.840
 What drew you?

1:32:46.840 --> 1:32:48.120
 I like these questions.

1:32:48.120 --> 1:32:50.040
 Now we're really getting deep.

1:32:50.040 --> 1:32:51.800
 Yeah, this is like a therapy session.

1:32:51.800 --> 1:32:55.680
 I mean, isn't it terrifying to be in front of a camera?

1:32:55.680 --> 1:32:58.160
 Well, it's terrifying to be in front of five cameras.

1:32:58.160 --> 1:32:59.160
 The set up is.

1:32:59.160 --> 1:33:00.400
 Corrections, six.

1:33:00.400 --> 1:33:01.240
 Six, okay.

1:33:01.240 --> 1:33:04.320
 It's more terrifying for me to try to remember

1:33:04.320 --> 1:33:06.200
 if I actually turned them all.

1:33:06.200 --> 1:33:07.640
 Like I mentioned to you off mic,

1:33:07.640 --> 1:33:09.880
 I'm still suffering from a bit of PTSD

1:33:09.880 --> 1:33:13.560
 after screwing up a recording of Magnus.

1:33:15.040 --> 1:33:19.440
 He had to console me because that was the thing.

1:33:19.440 --> 1:33:23.680
 I felt, okay, you wanna build robots.

1:33:24.720 --> 1:33:28.320
 If you can't get a camera to even run correctly,

1:33:28.320 --> 1:33:30.600
 how are you gonna do anything else in life?

1:33:30.600 --> 1:33:33.040
 Oh no, don't let it spiral like that.

1:33:33.040 --> 1:33:36.240
 It was spiraling hard and I was just laying there

1:33:36.240 --> 1:33:38.640
 and just feeling sorry for myself.

1:33:38.640 --> 1:33:40.760
 But I think that feeling, by the way,

1:33:40.760 --> 1:33:43.160
 and the small tangent, is really useful.

1:33:44.280 --> 1:33:48.240
 I feel like a lot of growing happens when you feel shitty.

1:33:48.240 --> 1:33:50.640
 As long as you can get out of it.

1:33:50.640 --> 1:33:53.000
 Like don't let it spiral indefinitely.

1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:55.600
 But just feeling really, really shitty

1:33:55.600 --> 1:33:56.760
 about everything in my life.

1:33:56.760 --> 1:33:58.240
 Like I was having an existential crisis.

1:33:58.240 --> 1:34:01.920
 Like how will I be able to do anything at all?

1:34:01.920 --> 1:34:03.520
 Like you're a giant failure,

1:34:03.520 --> 1:34:06.000
 all those kinds of negative voices.

1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:08.880
 But I think I made some good decisions

1:34:08.880 --> 1:34:10.920
 in the week after that.

1:34:10.920 --> 1:34:11.760
 Of like, okay.

1:34:11.760 --> 1:34:13.160
 Do you think you couldn't have made those decisions

1:34:13.160 --> 1:34:14.960
 if you were less hard on yourself?

1:34:16.160 --> 1:34:18.280
 Me personally, no.

1:34:18.280 --> 1:34:19.600
 I'm too lazy.

1:34:19.600 --> 1:34:23.040
 Okay, so you really need to be angry at yourself enough

1:34:23.040 --> 1:34:24.400
 to go and do what you need.

1:34:24.400 --> 1:34:25.240
 Yeah, it's not even angry,

1:34:25.240 --> 1:34:27.320
 it's just upset of being self critical.

1:34:27.320 --> 1:34:29.640
 Like also for me personally,

1:34:29.640 --> 1:34:33.400
 because I don't have proclivities for depression,

1:34:34.720 --> 1:34:38.600
 I have a lot more room

1:34:38.600 --> 1:34:41.520
 to feel extremely shitty about myself.

1:34:41.520 --> 1:34:45.760
 So if you're somebody that can get stuck in that place,

1:34:45.760 --> 1:34:47.320
 like clinically depressed,

1:34:47.320 --> 1:34:48.880
 you have to be really, really careful.

1:34:48.880 --> 1:34:50.280
 You have to notice the triggers,

1:34:50.280 --> 1:34:51.760
 you don't wanna get into that place.

1:34:51.760 --> 1:34:54.160
 But for me, just looking empirically,

1:34:54.160 --> 1:34:58.200
 feeling shitty has always been productive.

1:34:58.200 --> 1:35:00.920
 Like it makes me long term happier.

1:35:00.920 --> 1:35:04.200
 Ultimately, it makes me more grateful to be alive

1:35:04.200 --> 1:35:06.120
 and it helps me grow, all those kinds of things.

1:35:06.120 --> 1:35:10.120
 So I kinda embrace it.

1:35:10.120 --> 1:35:12.680
 Otherwise, I feel like I will never do anything.

1:35:12.680 --> 1:35:13.720
 I have to feel shitty,

1:35:13.720 --> 1:35:16.600
 but that's not a thing I prescribe to others.

1:35:16.600 --> 1:35:19.760
 There's a famous professor at MIT,

1:35:19.760 --> 1:35:22.000
 his name is Marvin Minsky.

1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:25.400
 And when he was giving advice about like to the students,

1:35:26.440 --> 1:35:28.640
 he said, the secret to my success

1:35:28.640 --> 1:35:33.040
 was that I always hated everything I did in the past.

1:35:33.920 --> 1:35:36.080
 So always sort of being self critical

1:35:36.080 --> 1:35:37.080
 about everything you've accomplished,

1:35:37.080 --> 1:35:39.880
 never really take a moment of gratitude.

1:35:39.880 --> 1:35:41.640
 And I think for a lot of people that hear that,

1:35:41.640 --> 1:35:42.600
 that's not good.

1:35:42.600 --> 1:35:45.640
 You should like take a pause and be grateful,

1:35:45.640 --> 1:35:47.360
 but it really worked for him.

1:35:47.360 --> 1:35:50.600
 So it's a choice you have to make.

1:35:50.600 --> 1:35:54.440
 It reminds me of the quote, be happy but never satisfied,

1:35:54.440 --> 1:35:57.600
 where you can have a positive spin

1:35:57.600 --> 1:35:59.600
 and still want to improve yourself.

1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:05.560
 But yeah, like when did you decide

1:36:06.320 --> 1:36:08.200
 to take a step in the spotlight,

1:36:08.200 --> 1:36:11.160
 that terrifying spotlight of the internet?

1:36:11.160 --> 1:36:14.280
 It was actually my senior year of college

1:36:14.280 --> 1:36:17.840
 and I was really busy with work and school

1:36:17.840 --> 1:36:21.000
 and chess was kind of like this lost love.

1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:22.800
 And the interesting thing is that

1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:24.240
 the longer I don't play chess,

1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:26.320
 the more I kind of miss playing it casually

1:36:26.320 --> 1:36:27.360
 and enjoy it more.

1:36:27.360 --> 1:36:30.040
 Cause then I start looking at it with fresh eyes,

1:36:30.040 --> 1:36:32.000
 but I didn't have time to play tournaments.

1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:35.920
 So I started streaming online because it was more social

1:36:35.920 --> 1:36:38.320
 than just playing strangers on the internet

1:36:38.320 --> 1:36:41.120
 without knowing anything about who they are.

1:36:41.120 --> 1:36:44.440
 And I started slowly growing a community

1:36:44.440 --> 1:36:47.480
 and got in touch with chess.com pretty quickly too.

1:36:47.480 --> 1:36:50.080
 So then it was this hobby that I would do once a week,

1:36:50.080 --> 1:36:52.400
 every Thursday at 8 p.m.

1:36:52.400 --> 1:36:55.880
 And it was one of the things that brought me a lot of joy.

1:36:55.880 --> 1:36:58.800
 And actually I, speaking of depression,

1:36:58.800 --> 1:37:02.120
 did struggle for it with at least 10 years of my life.

1:37:02.120 --> 1:37:06.080
 And it was one of those things where chess and streaming

1:37:06.080 --> 1:37:09.840
 was such a distraction and it brought me such great joy

1:37:09.840 --> 1:37:13.720
 that I just kept doing it cause I really, really liked it.

1:37:13.720 --> 1:37:18.080
 And then I was working on something that didn't pan out

1:37:18.080 --> 1:37:21.520
 and decided to go and take a risk and just stream full time,

1:37:21.520 --> 1:37:26.520
 which, you know, seemed a little bit weird at the moment.

1:37:26.520 --> 1:37:29.000
 Was that terrifying, that leap?

1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:30.200
 It was terrifying,

1:37:30.200 --> 1:37:33.320
 but I had taken so many terrifying leaps in the past

1:37:33.320 --> 1:37:36.560
 and they didn't, you know, the last two hadn't worked out,

1:37:36.560 --> 1:37:39.440
 but I was like, well, I'll get it eventually.

1:37:39.440 --> 1:37:43.440
 So somehow having failed before and going through failure

1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:45.880
 and knowing that it'll be okay,

1:37:45.880 --> 1:37:48.360
 made me more likely to just try something

1:37:48.360 --> 1:37:50.360
 that was a very, very weird job.

1:37:51.280 --> 1:37:52.280
 Goodbye camera.

1:37:52.280 --> 1:37:53.160
 I saw it die.

1:37:53.160 --> 1:37:55.840
 Yeah, the camera, we don't need it.

1:37:55.840 --> 1:37:56.680
 But one of the cameras died.

1:37:56.680 --> 1:37:58.640
 Luckily we have another five.

1:37:58.640 --> 1:37:59.880
 Yeah, I know.

1:37:59.880 --> 1:38:02.080
 Like this is where this triggers the spiral,

1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:04.720
 Alexis is gonna go to A to death now.

1:38:04.720 --> 1:38:06.380
 It's still somehow awake.

1:38:09.200 --> 1:38:12.680
 Is there advice you can give about the dark places

1:38:12.680 --> 1:38:15.080
 you've gone in your mind, the depression you suffered from,

1:38:15.080 --> 1:38:18.560
 how to get out from your own story?

1:38:18.560 --> 1:38:21.480
 Whenever I go to those really dark places,

1:38:21.480 --> 1:38:24.760
 the scariest thing is that it feels like

1:38:24.760 --> 1:38:27.560
 I will never get rid of this feeling

1:38:27.560 --> 1:38:29.620
 and it is very overwhelming.

1:38:31.680 --> 1:38:36.680
 And I just have to kind of look back over time spans

1:38:37.180 --> 1:38:39.860
 and remember that every single time I have got through it

1:38:39.860 --> 1:38:42.640
 and remind myself that it is just temporary.

1:38:42.640 --> 1:38:45.020
 And that has been the most helpful thing for me

1:38:45.020 --> 1:38:47.920
 because I just try to combat the scariest thing about it.

1:38:49.760 --> 1:38:52.600
 And then believe, have faith that it's gonna,

1:38:52.600 --> 1:38:53.680
 like this will go away.

1:38:53.680 --> 1:38:57.000
 And take action obviously to make sure it goes away.

1:38:57.000 --> 1:38:59.480
 And I've also tried to spin it as depression

1:38:59.480 --> 1:39:01.240
 is one of the hardest things I've had to deal with,

1:39:01.240 --> 1:39:03.480
 but also one of the biggest motivators

1:39:03.480 --> 1:39:06.400
 because if I just am left with my own brain,

1:39:06.400 --> 1:39:07.820
 I get very depressed.

1:39:07.820 --> 1:39:10.640
 Then I really like working or focusing on things.

1:39:10.640 --> 1:39:13.520
 So it actually pushed me to try to focus on school,

1:39:13.520 --> 1:39:16.080
 try to focus on chess, focus on whatever I'm doing.

1:39:16.080 --> 1:39:18.000
 And also if I'm feeling really bad,

1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.680
 then there's probably something a little bit off

1:39:20.680 --> 1:39:23.360
 and I use it as a signal and try to think of it as,

1:39:23.360 --> 1:39:25.440
 okay, this is just a sign that there's things

1:39:25.440 --> 1:39:27.760
 that could be improved for long term.

1:39:27.760 --> 1:39:28.880
 What about you, Andrea?

1:39:28.880 --> 1:39:31.400
 Have you gone to dark places in your mind?

1:39:31.400 --> 1:39:36.360
 I'd say my family, like I see Alex going through this,

1:39:36.360 --> 1:39:38.840
 my mom also has very serious depression.

1:39:38.840 --> 1:39:41.560
 Luckily, I got the genes where I don't go through

1:39:41.560 --> 1:39:44.600
 that serious level of depression that they do.

1:39:44.600 --> 1:39:47.240
 I'd say mine is much more temporarily.

1:39:47.240 --> 1:39:50.020
 So it's more similar to what I was feeling

1:39:50.020 --> 1:39:51.880
 when I was feeling shitty about it.

1:39:51.880 --> 1:39:53.440
 Exactly, you go through periods, yes, exactly,

1:39:53.440 --> 1:39:55.840
 where like, but I know that it's not something

1:39:55.840 --> 1:40:00.280
 that's clinical and that's just a genetic thing

1:40:00.280 --> 1:40:02.720
 or a mental thing, whereas I know it's more serious

1:40:02.720 --> 1:40:04.680
 for like my family members.

1:40:04.680 --> 1:40:06.800
 And I did relate a lot with you where you're saying

1:40:06.800 --> 1:40:08.840
 where that really pushes you and I felt that a lot

1:40:08.840 --> 1:40:12.280
 through content where you just kind of feel hopeless

1:40:12.280 --> 1:40:14.680
 and kind of like an existential crisis

1:40:14.680 --> 1:40:16.240
 where I don't like the content I'm doing

1:40:16.240 --> 1:40:18.440
 and that's what pushes me to like, okay,

1:40:18.440 --> 1:40:20.300
 you have no choice but to try something

1:40:20.300 --> 1:40:21.760
 that now you're gonna be passionate about

1:40:21.760 --> 1:40:22.880
 because otherwise you're gonna be stuck

1:40:22.880 --> 1:40:24.920
 in this never ending cycle.

1:40:24.920 --> 1:40:28.600
 So it's short term and then it helps me come up

1:40:28.600 --> 1:40:31.080
 with the things that I enjoy the most content wise

1:40:31.080 --> 1:40:33.480
 and it also long term taught me just how to have

1:40:33.480 --> 1:40:36.000
 a more balanced life, like doing small things

1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:37.640
 that make me happier on a daily basis,

1:40:37.640 --> 1:40:39.840
 to like working out, to eating healthier,

1:40:39.840 --> 1:40:42.180
 which I notice when I don't do for weeks,

1:40:42.180 --> 1:40:43.780
 I just get a lot more depressed.

1:40:44.960 --> 1:40:48.720
 What has playing chess taught you about life?

1:40:48.720 --> 1:40:52.880
 Has it made you better at life in any kind of way

1:40:52.880 --> 1:40:54.240
 or has it made you worse?

1:40:54.240 --> 1:40:56.800
 You know, a lot of people kind of romanticize the idea

1:40:56.800 --> 1:40:59.880
 that chess is kind of like life or life is kind of like chess

1:40:59.880 --> 1:41:03.240
 and becoming better at making decisions on the chess board

1:41:03.240 --> 1:41:06.120
 is gonna make you better at making decisions in life.

1:41:06.120 --> 1:41:07.520
 Is there some truth to that?

1:41:09.080 --> 1:41:11.880
 I always shy away from these comparisons

1:41:11.880 --> 1:41:14.140
 with chess and life.

1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:17.680
 Cause yeah, it has both positives and negatives.

1:41:17.680 --> 1:41:21.000
 So one thing it really helps develop from an early age

1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:23.160
 is having an analytical mind,

1:41:23.160 --> 1:41:25.880
 but then you could also get like paralysis of analysis

1:41:25.880 --> 1:41:28.200
 where you've just thought of everything to death

1:41:28.200 --> 1:41:29.520
 and you're moving too slowly

1:41:29.520 --> 1:41:31.320
 when you just have to keep going forward

1:41:31.320 --> 1:41:33.560
 cause there's not a great path ahead.

1:41:33.560 --> 1:41:38.560
 So it's more like exercising your brain and staying sharp

1:41:39.660 --> 1:41:41.360
 and then also applying that to other things.

1:41:41.360 --> 1:41:43.000
 Whereas if instead of playing chess,

1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:44.520
 you were watching TV or something like that,

1:41:44.520 --> 1:41:47.200
 you'd probably end up being less sharp.

1:41:47.200 --> 1:41:49.840
 Yeah, I used to, in high school,

1:41:49.840 --> 1:41:50.880
 I'd always preach like,

1:41:50.880 --> 1:41:55.080
 ah, chess transfers to life skills that I would teach.

1:41:55.080 --> 1:41:56.960
 I taught chess for juvenile department

1:41:56.960 --> 1:41:58.360
 for a special education school.

1:41:58.360 --> 1:42:00.860
 I'd cite studies in prisons where like,

1:42:00.860 --> 1:42:02.920
 oh, playing chess helped them with X

1:42:02.920 --> 1:42:05.240
 and for your kids, it helps with teamwork

1:42:05.240 --> 1:42:07.360
 and thinking over life choices.

1:42:07.360 --> 1:42:09.920
 And now that I'm older, I don't believe in any of that BS.

1:42:09.920 --> 1:42:14.920
 But I do think that the process of working really hard

1:42:15.700 --> 1:42:18.660
 at something which takes really long to see results

1:42:18.660 --> 1:42:20.160
 and you have to be really dedicated.

1:42:20.160 --> 1:42:22.940
 And like, I remember in high school and in middle school,

1:42:22.940 --> 1:42:25.500
 well, all my friends, they were having fun on the weekends

1:42:25.500 --> 1:42:27.760
 and I'd have to be there studying as a chess a day

1:42:27.760 --> 1:42:29.600
 and knowing one day I'll pay off,

1:42:29.600 --> 1:42:32.600
 but for like two, three years, nothing paid off.

1:42:32.600 --> 1:42:35.920
 Kind of learning that type of patience with anything,

1:42:35.920 --> 1:42:37.840
 it's like, you know, like getting a real job.

1:42:37.840 --> 1:42:41.280
 I can't say I ever really worked a real job in my life

1:42:41.280 --> 1:42:42.760
 since I went straight into streaming

1:42:42.760 --> 1:42:44.660
 and I got to work for myself,

1:42:44.660 --> 1:42:47.640
 but I'd say it's what people go to college for.

1:42:47.640 --> 1:42:49.360
 Like they learn how to live in the real world

1:42:49.360 --> 1:42:52.360
 and I'd say that that's what chess taught me as a kid.

1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:53.360
 When you're streaming,

1:42:53.360 --> 1:42:58.280
 when you're doing the creative work, do you feel lonely?

1:42:58.280 --> 1:43:01.520
 So a bunch of creators talk about sort of the,

1:43:01.520 --> 1:43:06.320
 it's counterintuitive because you're famous now, you know.

1:43:06.320 --> 1:43:09.680
 Sort of, not quite, but we're very lucky

1:43:09.680 --> 1:43:11.040
 to have each other.

1:43:11.040 --> 1:43:13.320
 So is that the source of the comfort

1:43:13.320 --> 1:43:18.040
 and like, is there some sense where it's isolating

1:43:18.040 --> 1:43:19.240
 to have these personalities,

1:43:19.240 --> 1:43:23.100
 they have to always be having fun, being wild and so on?

1:43:24.100 --> 1:43:25.540
 Or is it actually the opposite?

1:43:25.540 --> 1:43:26.920
 Like, is it a source of comfort

1:43:26.920 --> 1:43:28.920
 to know that there's so many cool people out there

1:43:28.920 --> 1:43:31.320
 that are giving you their love?

1:43:31.320 --> 1:43:34.240
 It started as a source of comfort

1:43:34.240 --> 1:43:37.000
 because it started with a very small community

1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:38.640
 who would be something,

1:43:38.640 --> 1:43:41.260
 it would be around 200 to 300 viewers

1:43:41.260 --> 1:43:43.320
 and you know, only like 30 to 40 of them

1:43:43.320 --> 1:43:45.020
 would actually chat actively.

1:43:45.020 --> 1:43:47.960
 So you felt like it was a community, not an audience.

1:43:47.960 --> 1:43:49.480
 So you like knew them personally almost.

1:43:49.480 --> 1:43:50.320
 Yeah, exactly.

1:43:50.320 --> 1:43:53.040
 And it was people who were interested in chess

1:43:53.040 --> 1:43:55.200
 and I would really enjoy that.

1:43:55.200 --> 1:43:58.160
 And then as, you know, we started growing bigger,

1:43:58.160 --> 1:43:59.860
 the audience kind of changed

1:43:59.860 --> 1:44:03.280
 where they're not there for you personally,

1:44:03.280 --> 1:44:05.680
 they're there while you're entertaining

1:44:05.680 --> 1:44:08.360
 and it changed for me.

1:44:08.360 --> 1:44:11.160
 And I ended up being a lot more self conscious

1:44:11.160 --> 1:44:14.280
 of things online and started even thinking of myself

1:44:14.280 --> 1:44:17.120
 more like a product than a human being when I'm online

1:44:17.120 --> 1:44:18.000
 because I had to.

1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:18.920
 Brand.

1:44:18.920 --> 1:44:19.880
 Yes, exactly.

1:44:19.880 --> 1:44:22.080
 Otherwise you just start taking everything personally

1:44:22.080 --> 1:44:23.440
 that people comment about you

1:44:23.440 --> 1:44:26.320
 and it's based off a very small clip.

1:44:26.320 --> 1:44:28.720
 I see, so it was almost a kind of a defense mechanism.

1:44:28.720 --> 1:44:30.400
 Exactly.

1:44:30.400 --> 1:44:32.800
 And it took time to get enough,

1:44:32.800 --> 1:44:34.640
 because even if you have tough skin,

1:44:34.640 --> 1:44:36.240
 eventually it gets to you when you're online

1:44:36.240 --> 1:44:38.200
 every single day listening to, you know,

1:44:38.200 --> 1:44:40.100
 thousands of people's feedback on you.

1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:43.760
 I think the loneliest part of being creator

1:44:43.760 --> 1:44:45.120
 is going through burnout,

1:44:45.120 --> 1:44:48.720
 which everyone is just, it's bound to happen,

1:44:48.720 --> 1:44:50.200
 which is why I think we're very lucky

1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:52.360
 that we have each other because right,

1:44:52.360 --> 1:44:55.240
 it's a numbers game and you're viral and trendy

1:44:55.240 --> 1:44:58.000
 at one point and then you have to fall.

1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:00.080
 And then there's months where you're just grinding.

1:45:00.080 --> 1:45:01.720
 And I just come into my friends room and I'm like,

1:45:01.720 --> 1:45:02.880
 Andrea, we're irrelevant.

1:45:02.880 --> 1:45:06.880
 That's where I'm glad, that's really like the worst part

1:45:06.880 --> 1:45:08.840
 of being creator and figuring out how to get over that hump.

1:45:08.840 --> 1:45:10.720
 But it makes me very grateful that I have my sister

1:45:10.720 --> 1:45:14.680
 because I know that I'm not the only person going through it.

1:45:14.680 --> 1:45:17.960
 And yeah, I know that most of my creator friends

1:45:17.960 --> 1:45:19.400
 feel very lonely in that process

1:45:19.400 --> 1:45:21.280
 because they don't have someone who's their family

1:45:21.280 --> 1:45:22.680
 and their business partner and they're working

1:45:22.680 --> 1:45:24.040
 by each other side by side.

1:45:24.040 --> 1:45:27.880
 You kind of tie in your self worth to your job

1:45:27.880 --> 1:45:30.440
 and your content and maybe even more extremely

1:45:30.440 --> 1:45:34.600
 than other jobs because you also are the entire company

1:45:34.600 --> 1:45:35.940
 and the entire product.

1:45:35.940 --> 1:45:38.460
 So when things are going well or when things are not,

1:45:38.460 --> 1:45:40.520
 you just need to be careful to not reflect it like,

1:45:40.520 --> 1:45:41.680
 oh, I am doing bad.

1:45:41.680 --> 1:45:44.200
 I am bad rather than the trends have now changed.

1:45:44.200 --> 1:45:45.920
 There's outside things we're gonna keep going

1:45:45.920 --> 1:45:47.780
 and this is just the normal waves,

1:45:47.780 --> 1:45:49.680
 which is how we think about it now.

1:45:49.680 --> 1:45:52.320
 And also just about, are we enjoying this?

1:45:52.320 --> 1:45:53.440
 Is this what we wanna make?

1:45:53.440 --> 1:45:56.280
 But we were stuck in the camp for a while

1:45:56.280 --> 1:46:00.480
 when we 10Xed our viewership after the pandemic

1:46:00.480 --> 1:46:02.280
 because people were home and playing chess.

1:46:02.280 --> 1:46:04.440
 And then of course that dropped by like 70%.

1:46:04.440 --> 1:46:06.640
 And then you see that and you're trying your best

1:46:06.640 --> 1:46:09.360
 and you just kind of have to deal with it and be like,

1:46:09.360 --> 1:46:11.000
 okay, I'm just gonna keep persevering

1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:13.680
 and maybe it'll get better.

1:46:13.680 --> 1:46:14.560
 That's so fascinating.

1:46:14.560 --> 1:46:19.560
 I mean, this is a struggle of sorts in the 21st century

1:46:20.160 --> 1:46:23.400
 of like how to be an artist, how to be a creator,

1:46:23.400 --> 1:46:27.180
 how to be an interesting mind in response to this algorithm.

1:46:27.180 --> 1:46:30.480
 I'm telling you, turning off views and likes is really good.

1:46:30.480 --> 1:46:32.920
 I don't look at Twitch views for that reason.

1:46:32.920 --> 1:46:34.720
 And I get obsessed with the numbers too.

1:46:34.720 --> 1:46:37.200
 And I know Andrea does, but for me,

1:46:37.200 --> 1:46:39.620
 what I try now is to be more focused in the moment,

1:46:39.620 --> 1:46:42.440
 but Andrea somehow can do it even with the views.

1:46:42.440 --> 1:46:44.360
 So you just, you get, you have fun with it.

1:46:44.360 --> 1:46:48.760
 I'm too much of like a given to the temporary satisfaction.

1:46:48.760 --> 1:46:51.080
 Like I like seeing, I like knowing

1:46:51.080 --> 1:46:52.760
 that if something happens right now,

1:46:52.760 --> 1:46:55.160
 viewership's gonna boost by a couple of hundred

1:46:55.160 --> 1:46:57.180
 and seeing that I'm right, of course.

1:46:57.180 --> 1:46:58.760
 But what about when the viewers start dropping?

1:46:58.760 --> 1:47:00.600
 Exactly, well, and I always,

1:47:00.600 --> 1:47:02.760
 like you just have this intuition now.

1:47:02.760 --> 1:47:05.000
 But I think also the reason that it doesn't affect me

1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:08.880
 so much is when we first started our content journey,

1:47:08.880 --> 1:47:10.120
 we were only Twitch streamers.

1:47:10.120 --> 1:47:13.320
 And we, our livelihood were based on Twitch viewers.

1:47:13.320 --> 1:47:16.440
 But now like I've learned how to recycle that content

1:47:16.440 --> 1:47:18.840
 into like YouTube and shorts and other things

1:47:18.840 --> 1:47:21.300
 where I know like, okay, if this stream does badly,

1:47:21.300 --> 1:47:22.760
 there's so many more things you can do

1:47:22.760 --> 1:47:24.860
 that also just have a much larger output.

1:47:24.860 --> 1:47:27.840
 So it doesn't get to me as much as it did.

1:47:27.840 --> 1:47:29.720
 Do you ever feel that with your podcasts

1:47:29.720 --> 1:47:32.400
 or do you feel like it's been authentic since the start?

1:47:32.400 --> 1:47:35.240
 No, so there's a million things to say there.

1:47:35.240 --> 1:47:40.240
 So one is there's a reason I stopped taking a salary at MIT

1:47:40.240 --> 1:47:45.240
 and moved to Texas is I wanted my bank account to go to zero

1:47:46.100 --> 1:47:48.680
 because I do my best with my back against the wall.

1:47:48.680 --> 1:47:50.620
 So one of the comforts I have is I don't care

1:47:50.620 --> 1:47:52.720
 if this podcast is popular or not.

1:47:52.720 --> 1:47:54.700
 I want it to not be popular.

1:47:54.700 --> 1:47:56.180
 So I don't want it to make money.

1:47:56.180 --> 1:47:57.100
 You're failing Lex.

1:47:57.100 --> 1:47:59.800
 Yeah, I wanna, I mean, I just do best

1:47:59.800 --> 1:48:03.060
 when I'm more desperate.

1:48:03.060 --> 1:48:04.420
 That's like one thing to say.

1:48:04.420 --> 1:48:06.100
 Seems like a reoccurring theme

1:48:06.100 --> 1:48:08.580
 with how you build up your greatest work,

1:48:08.580 --> 1:48:10.860
 which is honestly very respectable.

1:48:10.860 --> 1:48:14.220
 Yeah, so thank you.

1:48:14.220 --> 1:48:15.540
 This is like.

1:48:15.540 --> 1:48:17.020
 I wouldn't recommend.

1:48:17.020 --> 1:48:20.420
 Right, thank you for finding the silver lining

1:48:20.420 --> 1:48:23.140
 for an unhealthy mental state.

1:48:24.180 --> 1:48:26.540
 But the other thing is I was very conscious

1:48:26.540 --> 1:48:29.700
 just like with chess and those kinds of things

1:48:29.700 --> 1:48:31.940
 that I love numbers.

1:48:31.940 --> 1:48:35.020
 And I would be, if I paid attention,

1:48:35.020 --> 1:48:38.300
 if I tried to be somebody at their best,

1:48:38.300 --> 1:48:42.860
 like Mr. Beast who really pays attention to numbers,

1:48:42.860 --> 1:48:46.060
 I would just not, I'd become destroyed by it.

1:48:47.380 --> 1:48:48.780
 The highs and the lows of it.

1:48:48.780 --> 1:48:50.660
 And I just don't think I would be creating

1:48:50.660 --> 1:48:54.220
 the best work possible.

1:48:54.220 --> 1:48:59.220
 But one of the big benefits of a podcast,

1:48:59.220 --> 1:49:02.780
 it's listeners and there's an intimacy with the voice.

1:49:02.780 --> 1:49:06.500
 And I think that is much more stable

1:49:06.500 --> 1:49:10.900
 and a deeper and a more meaningful connection than YouTube.

1:49:10.900 --> 1:49:13.140
 YouTube is a fickle mistress.

1:49:13.140 --> 1:49:18.140
 So it's a weird drug that like, it really wants you.

1:49:18.500 --> 1:49:20.060
 With very addicting feedback loops.

1:49:20.060 --> 1:49:23.420
 When you have a video that's number one out of 10,

1:49:23.420 --> 1:49:25.860
 oh my God, the adrenaline you get.

1:49:25.860 --> 1:49:28.680
 And then the thing I really don't like also

1:49:28.680 --> 1:49:33.680
 is the world will introduce you as a person

1:49:33.680 --> 1:49:38.680
 that has a video on YouTube with some X number of views.

1:49:39.080 --> 1:49:42.300
 Like the world wants you to be addicted to these numbers.

1:49:42.300 --> 1:49:43.140
 What?

1:49:43.140 --> 1:49:45.200
 Because they associate it with having done a good job.

1:49:45.200 --> 1:49:46.040
 Yeah.

1:49:46.040 --> 1:49:47.240
 Because that's what people think views are,

1:49:47.240 --> 1:49:48.120
 even if it's not.

1:49:48.120 --> 1:49:48.960
 Right.

1:49:48.960 --> 1:49:52.280
 And primarily because they don't have any other signal

1:49:52.280 --> 1:49:53.700
 of what's a good job.

1:49:53.700 --> 1:49:56.160
 I think the much better signal is people

1:49:56.160 --> 1:49:59.020
 that are close to you, your family, your colleagues,

1:49:59.020 --> 1:50:00.760
 that say, wow, that was cool, I listened to that,

1:50:00.760 --> 1:50:02.680
 that was really, I didn't know this,

1:50:02.680 --> 1:50:05.760
 this was really powerful, this is really moving and so on.

1:50:05.760 --> 1:50:08.040
 But definitely I'm terrified of numbers.

1:50:08.040 --> 1:50:10.680
 Because I feel like, just like I said,

1:50:10.680 --> 1:50:15.680
 I'd rather be a Stanley Kubrick, right?

1:50:16.320 --> 1:50:20.320
 You'd rather create great art,

1:50:21.620 --> 1:50:22.580
 not to be pretentious,

1:50:22.580 --> 1:50:24.740
 but the best possible thing you can create.

1:50:24.740 --> 1:50:26.040
 Whatever the beauty that's,

1:50:26.040 --> 1:50:28.480
 the capacity for creating beauty that's in you,

1:50:28.480 --> 1:50:29.720
 I would like to maximize that.

1:50:29.720 --> 1:50:32.400
 And I feel like for some people like Mr. Beast,

1:50:32.400 --> 1:50:35.080
 I think those are perfectly aligned.

1:50:35.080 --> 1:50:37.660
 Because he just loves the most epic thing possible,

1:50:37.660 --> 1:50:38.680
 but not for everybody.

1:50:38.680 --> 1:50:39.840
 I think there's a lot of people

1:50:39.840 --> 1:50:42.360
 for whom that's not perfectly aligned.

1:50:42.360 --> 1:50:44.760
 And so I'm definitely one of those.

1:50:44.760 --> 1:50:46.240
 And I'm still really confused

1:50:46.240 --> 1:50:48.040
 why anybody listens to this anyway.

1:50:49.680 --> 1:50:53.080
 But that's also something I guess you're trying to find,

1:50:53.080 --> 1:50:54.240
 trying to figure out.

1:50:54.240 --> 1:50:58.120
 I get very afraid of ever becoming someone

1:50:58.120 --> 1:51:00.080
 who just makes junk food content,

1:51:00.080 --> 1:51:03.600
 where you can't stop while you're in the moment,

1:51:03.600 --> 1:51:05.320
 and it has all of your attention,

1:51:05.320 --> 1:51:06.640
 but when you're done,

1:51:06.640 --> 1:51:09.740
 it didn't really bring any value to your life,

1:51:09.740 --> 1:51:11.920
 which is something that I think the algorithm

1:51:11.920 --> 1:51:14.220
 still does really reward.

1:51:14.220 --> 1:51:16.760
 And making sure that as we are learning

1:51:16.760 --> 1:51:18.160
 how to create better content,

1:51:18.160 --> 1:51:21.280
 it's still something that is gonna be meaningful long term.

1:51:21.280 --> 1:51:25.120
 Well, ultimately, you inspire a lot of young people.

1:51:26.920 --> 1:51:27.920
 Yeah, those are the best.

1:51:27.920 --> 1:51:30.200
 When I get messages from people who are like,

1:51:30.200 --> 1:51:33.160
 I played you a year ago, and my rating was 1400,

1:51:33.160 --> 1:51:34.200
 and now I'm 1900.

1:51:34.200 --> 1:51:35.480
 I'd like to challenge you again.

1:51:35.480 --> 1:51:38.080
 It's a 14 year old writing a former email.

1:51:38.080 --> 1:51:40.720
 Those things are always very, very fun to get.

1:51:40.720 --> 1:51:42.240
 And even just outside of chess,

1:51:42.240 --> 1:51:44.080
 it's just empowering to see,

1:51:44.080 --> 1:51:46.720
 like for young women too, to see that kind of thing.

1:51:46.720 --> 1:51:50.080
 I mean, you guys are being yourself,

1:51:50.080 --> 1:51:51.880
 and making money for being yourself,

1:51:51.880 --> 1:51:54.880
 and having fun, and growing as human beings,

1:51:54.880 --> 1:51:57.680
 which I think is really inspiring for people to see.

1:51:57.680 --> 1:51:59.300
 So in that sense, it's really rewarding.

1:51:59.300 --> 1:52:01.780
 And then the way I think about it is

1:52:03.180 --> 1:52:06.440
 there is some benefit of doing entertaining type of stuff

1:52:06.440 --> 1:52:09.020
 so that you get the,

1:52:10.600 --> 1:52:13.320
 kind of like Mr. Beast does with philanthropy, right?

1:52:13.320 --> 1:52:15.080
 The bigger Mr. Beast becomes,

1:52:15.080 --> 1:52:16.880
 the more effective he is at actually doing

1:52:16.880 --> 1:52:18.380
 positive impact on the world.

1:52:18.380 --> 1:52:22.320
 So those things are tied together.

1:52:22.320 --> 1:52:25.440
 But of course, with podcasts, you guys,

1:52:25.440 --> 1:52:28.120
 well, maybe you have these kinds of tense things,

1:52:28.120 --> 1:52:31.960
 but what kind of ideas, what kind of people do platform?

1:52:31.960 --> 1:52:33.440
 What kind of person,

1:52:36.120 --> 1:52:38.160
 what kind of human being do you wanna be?

1:52:39.120 --> 1:52:42.120
 Because you are actually becoming a person,

1:52:42.120 --> 1:52:47.120
 and a set of ideas in front of the public eye,

1:52:47.240 --> 1:52:49.480
 and you have to ask yourself that question really hard,

1:52:49.480 --> 1:52:50.880
 like really seriously.

1:52:50.880 --> 1:52:54.520
 Because if you're doing stuff in private,

1:52:54.520 --> 1:52:57.240
 you have the complete luxury to try shit out.

1:52:57.240 --> 1:52:58.240
 Right.

1:52:58.240 --> 1:53:01.260
 I think you have less of a luxury to try shit out

1:53:01.260 --> 1:53:04.240
 because the internet can be vicious in punishing you

1:53:04.240 --> 1:53:05.640
 for trying shit out.

1:53:05.640 --> 1:53:07.640
 And do you think that's sometimes a bad thing

1:53:07.640 --> 1:53:10.060
 where you have less freedom to make mistakes?

1:53:11.800 --> 1:53:12.840
 Yeah, you have two choices.

1:53:12.840 --> 1:53:14.920
 So one, you put up a wall

1:53:14.920 --> 1:53:17.720
 and say I don't give a shit what people think.

1:53:17.720 --> 1:53:18.560
 I don't like doing that

1:53:18.560 --> 1:53:20.220
 because I like being fragile to the world,

1:53:20.220 --> 1:53:23.320
 keeping my, sort of wearing my heart on my sleeve.

1:53:23.320 --> 1:53:26.060
 Or the other one, yeah, you have to be,

1:53:26.060 --> 1:53:30.560
 you have to actually think through what you're gonna say.

1:53:30.560 --> 1:53:33.720
 You have to think of like, what do I believe?

1:53:33.720 --> 1:53:38.640
 You have to be more serious about what you put out there.

1:53:38.640 --> 1:53:41.360
 It's annoying, but it's also actually,

1:53:41.360 --> 1:53:43.600
 you should have always been doing that.

1:53:43.600 --> 1:53:46.500
 You should be deliberate with your actions and your words.

1:53:48.680 --> 1:53:49.960
 But I don't know, it's,

1:53:49.960 --> 1:53:54.040
 but some of it, it's such a balance

1:53:54.040 --> 1:53:57.760
 because some of my favorite people are brilliant people

1:53:57.760 --> 1:54:01.280
 that allow themselves to act ridiculous and be silly.

1:54:01.280 --> 1:54:03.800
 Elon Musk, who's become a good friend,

1:54:03.800 --> 1:54:05.440
 is the silliest human of all.

1:54:05.440 --> 1:54:09.720
 I mean, he's incredibly brilliant and productive and so on,

1:54:09.720 --> 1:54:11.820
 but allows themselves to be silly.

1:54:11.820 --> 1:54:13.640
 And that's also inspiring to people.

1:54:13.640 --> 1:54:15.480
 Like you don't have to be perfect.

1:54:15.480 --> 1:54:19.800
 You don't have to, you can be a weird, a giant weird mess.

1:54:19.800 --> 1:54:20.880
 Then it's okay.

1:54:20.880 --> 1:54:22.600
 So it's a balance.

1:54:22.600 --> 1:54:25.040
 I think when you start to delve into political topics,

1:54:25.040 --> 1:54:28.240
 into topics that really get tense for people,

1:54:28.240 --> 1:54:31.320
 then you have to be a little bit more careful and deliberate.

1:54:31.320 --> 1:54:33.360
 But it's also wise to stay the hell away

1:54:33.360 --> 1:54:35.440
 from those topics in general.

1:54:35.440 --> 1:54:36.820
 Like I mentioned to you offline,

1:54:36.820 --> 1:54:39.840
 somebody I've been debating whether I want to talk to

1:54:39.840 --> 1:54:42.080
 or not is Karjakin on the chess board

1:54:42.080 --> 1:54:45.160
 because chess is just a game,

1:54:45.160 --> 1:54:48.480
 but throughout the history of the 20th century,

1:54:48.480 --> 1:54:51.720
 it was played between the Russians and the Americans

1:54:51.720 --> 1:54:56.360
 and so on where they were at war, cold or hot war.

1:54:56.360 --> 1:54:57.920
 And those are interesting.

1:54:57.920 --> 1:55:01.500
 Those are interesting conversations to be had

1:55:01.500 --> 1:55:03.280
 at the Olympics and so on.

1:55:03.280 --> 1:55:04.600
 It's not just a game.

1:55:04.600 --> 1:55:05.840
 It's some sense.

1:55:05.840 --> 1:55:07.120
 It's like a mini war.

1:55:08.140 --> 1:55:11.600
 And so I have to decide whether I want to talk to him or not

1:55:11.600 --> 1:55:12.440
 and those kinds of things.

1:55:12.440 --> 1:55:14.440
 You have to make those kinds of decisions.

1:55:14.440 --> 1:55:16.120
 For now, you guys are not playing chess

1:55:16.120 --> 1:55:18.880
 with Donald Trump or Obama or so on.

1:55:18.880 --> 1:55:20.880
 We are not right now, no.

1:55:20.880 --> 1:55:22.160
 How long is a stream?

1:55:22.160 --> 1:55:23.240
 Like a few hours, right?

1:55:23.240 --> 1:55:24.840
 Now they're two to three hours.

1:55:24.840 --> 1:55:26.040
 When I was first streaming,

1:55:26.040 --> 1:55:28.480
 I'd stream for like six hours a day.

1:55:28.480 --> 1:55:29.320
 A day.

1:55:29.320 --> 1:55:30.440
 At least usually.

1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:33.320
 Yeah, for like six to seven days a week.

1:55:33.320 --> 1:55:34.840
 Are you doing just like a talking one?

1:55:34.840 --> 1:55:38.280
 No, I'd be playing chess the entire time while talking.

1:55:38.280 --> 1:55:41.320
 And when I started streaming,

1:55:42.180 --> 1:55:44.440
 that's kind of how everybody blows up on Twitch.

1:55:44.440 --> 1:55:47.360
 You're just putting in crazy hours and you're always there.

1:55:47.360 --> 1:55:49.200
 It's not about making the best content.

1:55:49.200 --> 1:55:51.480
 It's about letting people feel

1:55:51.480 --> 1:55:53.400
 like they're hanging out with you

1:55:53.400 --> 1:55:55.800
 and just being on as much as you can.

1:55:55.800 --> 1:55:58.120
 But I ended up feeling very burnt out

1:55:58.120 --> 1:56:00.400
 because it's hard to be your best self

1:56:00.400 --> 1:56:02.400
 when you're in front of a camera for that long

1:56:02.400 --> 1:56:06.580
 because you do get scared of going into places

1:56:06.580 --> 1:56:09.460
 where you want to learn, but you might not be the best in.

1:56:09.460 --> 1:56:10.920
 Because it's harder to learn in public

1:56:10.920 --> 1:56:12.080
 than do something that like,

1:56:12.080 --> 1:56:14.840
 yeah, we're better than 99% of our viewers at chess.

1:56:14.840 --> 1:56:18.480
 So that's a lot less scary than trying to play a game

1:56:18.480 --> 1:56:20.120
 that you're bad at or discuss topics

1:56:20.120 --> 1:56:21.360
 that you're interested in.

1:56:22.600 --> 1:56:26.720
 Yeah, have the beginner's mind and be dumb at something.

1:56:26.720 --> 1:56:27.560
 Right.

1:56:27.560 --> 1:56:28.880
 Yeah, which is where the fun is

1:56:28.880 --> 1:56:30.080
 and you get to learn together,

1:56:30.080 --> 1:56:32.280
 but people punish you for it on the internet.

1:56:33.480 --> 1:56:35.960
 What about you, Andrea?

1:56:35.960 --> 1:56:38.300
 Yeah, I think like Alex said at the beginning,

1:56:38.300 --> 1:56:39.760
 when we were grinding a lot,

1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:43.080
 you don't really even have time for much of a private life

1:56:43.080 --> 1:56:45.560
 because you're streaming every hour of your life

1:56:45.560 --> 1:56:49.160
 and people want it, like the appeal of streamers,

1:56:49.160 --> 1:56:50.600
 it's called like being parasocial

1:56:50.600 --> 1:56:52.080
 where you feel like they're your friend

1:56:52.080 --> 1:56:54.600
 and they like it because they want you

1:56:54.600 --> 1:56:57.120
 to share everything about your life.

1:56:57.120 --> 1:56:59.880
 Really the main challenge for me at first

1:56:59.880 --> 1:57:03.840
 when trying to prioritize quantity over quality,

1:57:03.840 --> 1:57:05.440
 which we're not doing anymore,

1:57:05.440 --> 1:57:08.560
 was realizing that I can't turn everything I'm interested in

1:57:08.560 --> 1:57:10.780
 and every passion into content.

1:57:11.920 --> 1:57:14.120
 Before I'm like, well, I must stream more,

1:57:14.120 --> 1:57:16.920
 but I like music and I like playing piano

1:57:16.920 --> 1:57:20.200
 and I like reading into these topics and I like fitness

1:57:20.200 --> 1:57:22.000
 and then I try to live stream all of it

1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:24.680
 and that's just, at some point it's like,

1:57:24.680 --> 1:57:27.500
 just enjoy your time off for those hobbies

1:57:27.500 --> 1:57:28.920
 and prioritize what you're good at

1:57:28.920 --> 1:57:32.680
 because that's just gonna be better for the channel overall.

1:57:32.680 --> 1:57:34.360
 So that was a learning lesson for sure.

1:57:34.360 --> 1:57:36.500
 It's nice because there are some intersections

1:57:36.500 --> 1:57:38.920
 when I have tried new things that I really enjoy

1:57:38.920 --> 1:57:41.720
 and it pays off, but that's less often.

1:57:41.720 --> 1:57:43.480
 So it's more like you can be yourself,

1:57:43.480 --> 1:57:46.640
 but only specific parts of yourself online

1:57:46.640 --> 1:57:50.720
 and the rest, sometimes it's nice to just keep private

1:57:50.720 --> 1:57:55.720
 and feel that you could just give it your 100% freedom.

1:57:56.840 --> 1:58:01.840
 See, I feel like I try to be the exact same person

1:58:02.240 --> 1:58:03.960
 on podcasts as in private life.

1:58:03.960 --> 1:58:06.840
 I really don't like hiding anything.

1:58:06.840 --> 1:58:08.600
 But you're also a generalist, right?

1:58:08.600 --> 1:58:10.280
 Where you have people with all topics.

1:58:10.280 --> 1:58:13.480
 For us, we built our audience off a very specific thing

1:58:13.480 --> 1:58:15.080
 so people sometimes feel like,

1:58:15.080 --> 1:58:17.000
 even at the start when we started playing less chess,

1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:18.900
 they're like, I subbed for chess.

1:58:18.900 --> 1:58:20.960
 Why are you not playing chess?

1:58:20.960 --> 1:58:21.800
 Exactly.

1:58:21.800 --> 1:58:23.960
 People are tuning in for an interesting conversation

1:58:23.960 --> 1:58:25.000
 on a bunch of topics.

1:58:25.000 --> 1:58:27.000
 So like the more you are yourself, the better it is,

1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:29.080
 but it is very hard when you build your brand

1:58:29.080 --> 1:58:31.880
 on like one type of gaming content.

1:58:31.880 --> 1:58:34.680
 Build your brand.

1:58:34.680 --> 1:58:36.480
 But yeah, the way you become a generalist

1:58:36.480 --> 1:58:38.960
 is you slowly expand.

1:58:38.960 --> 1:58:42.960
 It's like expand to checkers.

1:58:45.120 --> 1:58:47.520
 I guess that's like a downward.

1:58:47.520 --> 1:58:48.600
 Maybe poker.

1:58:48.600 --> 1:58:50.000
 Poker, yeah, exactly, poker.

1:58:50.000 --> 1:58:52.940
 But also just the ideas, the space of ideas.

1:58:52.940 --> 1:58:54.300
 And one of the cool things about chess

1:58:54.300 --> 1:58:56.720
 is when you're talking over the chess board,

1:58:56.720 --> 1:58:59.920
 you're, it's a kind of podcast, you know?

1:58:59.920 --> 1:59:02.700
 That is actually an idea we've had with playing chess

1:59:02.700 --> 1:59:05.400
 while also doing a podcast and talking with people.

1:59:05.400 --> 1:59:06.720
 It's kind of like an icebreaker.

1:59:06.720 --> 1:59:08.960
 We're also focusing on the game at the same time.

1:59:08.960 --> 1:59:11.340
 But you know, we are slowly evolving

1:59:11.340 --> 1:59:12.480
 and we're doing more things.

1:59:12.480 --> 1:59:15.060
 Like one thing we wanted to do is spend less time

1:59:15.060 --> 1:59:16.240
 in front of the computer.

1:59:16.240 --> 1:59:18.120
 So now we're doing a chess travel show

1:59:18.120 --> 1:59:19.440
 where we go to different countries

1:59:19.440 --> 1:59:20.840
 and look at the chess culture.

1:59:20.840 --> 1:59:23.080
 So it actually feels like we're doing things

1:59:23.080 --> 1:59:25.980
 that we would want to do and explore anyway.

1:59:25.980 --> 1:59:28.560
 And maybe it's not as much in the idea space,

1:59:28.560 --> 1:59:31.580
 which we both enjoy and do a lot in our own free time,

1:59:31.580 --> 1:59:34.760
 but in the sharing cool experiences with our audience

1:59:34.760 --> 1:59:36.000
 that we actually want to do.

1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:37.640
 Where do you look forward to going?

1:59:37.640 --> 1:59:41.320
 We're going to Romania on September 9th.

1:59:41.320 --> 1:59:44.340
 And I think this is the most exciting for me

1:59:44.340 --> 1:59:46.440
 because we're going back to, you know,

1:59:46.440 --> 1:59:48.880
 the country where our entire family's from,

1:59:48.880 --> 1:59:51.320
 where our grandmother taught our dad

1:59:51.320 --> 1:59:52.960
 who taught us how to play chess.

1:59:52.960 --> 1:59:54.960
 It has a very strong chess culture.

1:59:54.960 --> 1:59:58.920
 So it'll be very unique to go back and see

1:59:58.920 --> 2:00:00.600
 how everything is when we haven't been back

2:00:00.600 --> 2:00:01.640
 for a very long time.

2:00:01.640 --> 2:00:04.680
 And for Romanians, like it's very rare

2:00:04.680 --> 2:00:06.200
 when there's like a famous Romanian

2:00:06.200 --> 2:00:07.880
 who accomplishes something,

2:00:07.880 --> 2:00:09.080
 which is why like right now,

2:00:09.080 --> 2:00:10.800
 Andrew Tate's the most famous Romanian.

2:00:10.800 --> 2:00:12.640
 But he's banned for a bad reason.

2:00:12.640 --> 2:00:13.680
 Exactly.

2:00:13.680 --> 2:00:15.400
 And there's like something very special

2:00:15.400 --> 2:00:17.400
 about Romanian pride.

2:00:17.400 --> 2:00:19.640
 And when we meet fellow Romanians in the US,

2:00:19.640 --> 2:00:22.120
 like it's just an amazing connection.

2:00:22.120 --> 2:00:24.640
 And like, I hear the way my dad talk about like,

2:00:24.640 --> 2:00:28.560
 for example, Nadia, who was a famous Romanian gymnast

2:00:28.560 --> 2:00:30.080
 and he's like, yeah, like Romania,

2:00:30.080 --> 2:00:31.180
 we sucked at everything.

2:00:31.180 --> 2:00:34.560
 But when she won the Olympics for gymnast,

2:00:34.560 --> 2:00:36.440
 every kid on the street was doing gymnastics

2:00:36.440 --> 2:00:38.440
 because it's very rare that they make it

2:00:38.440 --> 2:00:39.480
 to that level of success.

2:00:39.480 --> 2:00:40.840
 And I'm not saying that we're super successful,

2:00:40.840 --> 2:00:42.780
 super famous, but it is really cool

2:00:42.780 --> 2:00:44.120
 to meet other Romanians through chess

2:00:44.120 --> 2:00:45.920
 because it's a very special bond.

2:00:45.920 --> 2:00:50.400
 Yeah, you feel like it's a community and like you belong.

2:00:50.400 --> 2:00:53.320
 Yeah, you can't get that anywhere else.

2:00:53.320 --> 2:00:55.560
 Let me ask your opinion since you mentioned him,

2:00:55.560 --> 2:00:59.680
 Andrew Tate, you're both women, successful women,

2:00:59.680 --> 2:01:01.200
 you're both creators.

2:01:01.200 --> 2:01:03.720
 So Andrew Tate is an example of somebody

2:01:03.720 --> 2:01:06.160
 that has become exceptionally successful

2:01:06.160 --> 2:01:10.320
 at galvanizing public attention,

2:01:10.320 --> 2:01:13.600
 but he's also, from many perspective, a misogynist.

2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:16.680
 So let me ask a personal question.

2:01:16.680 --> 2:01:19.180
 Do you think I should talk to him on this podcast?

2:01:19.180 --> 2:01:24.180
 How would you feel as a fan as somebody,

2:01:24.500 --> 2:01:29.420
 I'm talking to the great Alex and Andrea Botez

2:01:29.420 --> 2:01:32.220
 and the next episode is with Andrew Tate?

2:01:32.220 --> 2:01:34.560
 I think it's a double edged sword

2:01:34.560 --> 2:01:37.860
 and most of these things are not as black and white

2:01:37.860 --> 2:01:39.940
 as they seem, you know,

2:01:39.940 --> 2:01:43.340
 because on one hand, I don't agree with his beliefs

2:01:43.340 --> 2:01:45.900
 and I think he said a lot of things that are very hurtful

2:01:45.900 --> 2:01:49.460
 and that influence people's opinions.

2:01:51.140 --> 2:01:54.820
 At the same time, talking to someone through that

2:01:54.820 --> 2:01:57.100
 and trying to get to the root of it

2:01:57.100 --> 2:02:01.020
 and how much of it he used just as a social media tactic

2:02:01.020 --> 2:02:03.580
 to maybe change the opinion of people

2:02:03.580 --> 2:02:06.500
 who have been so influenced by him towards

2:02:06.500 --> 2:02:08.980
 something that is maybe more understanding towards women

2:02:08.980 --> 2:02:12.460
 or things like that could do some good,

2:02:12.460 --> 2:02:15.220
 but at the same time, platforming someone like that

2:02:15.220 --> 2:02:18.260
 and giving them more attention also signals to other people

2:02:18.260 --> 2:02:20.060
 who have a platform that it's okay,

2:02:20.060 --> 2:02:22.580
 so it's kind of weighing the pluses and the minuses

2:02:22.580 --> 2:02:25.980
 and it's a very tough decision because it's not clear.

2:02:25.980 --> 2:02:28.260
 And the thing about the internet,

2:02:28.260 --> 2:02:30.440
 you make the wrong decision, you're gonna pay for it.

2:02:30.440 --> 2:02:31.280
 Right.

2:02:32.580 --> 2:02:34.620
 That's the thing, like personally,

2:02:34.620 --> 2:02:37.340
 and it is funny, like I think the whole way

2:02:37.340 --> 2:02:39.060
 you rose to fame is just a growth hack

2:02:39.060 --> 2:02:40.420
 and I've seen other people do it

2:02:40.420 --> 2:02:42.680
 where like you just say kind of,

2:02:42.680 --> 2:02:45.680
 I don't, honestly, I don't really listen to his content

2:02:45.680 --> 2:02:46.980
 because I just find it so dumb,

2:02:46.980 --> 2:02:49.620
 but I think he knows that by saying the dumbest,

2:02:49.620 --> 2:02:52.860
 most controversial things, that's like a quick rise to fame

2:02:52.860 --> 2:02:56.460
 and I think surface level, like he can really hold it up,

2:02:56.460 --> 2:02:58.620
 but that's why I would honestly enjoy tuning

2:02:58.620 --> 2:03:00.780
 into a conversation where you're really breaking down

2:03:00.780 --> 2:03:02.140
 to the core of those beliefs

2:03:02.140 --> 2:03:04.660
 and I think like young kids who look up to him

2:03:04.660 --> 2:03:06.900
 and when you actually hear someone challenging it

2:03:06.900 --> 2:03:09.100
 could actually be helpful for people,

2:03:09.100 --> 2:03:12.300
 but at the same time, it's a lot of bad publicity,

2:03:12.300 --> 2:03:13.880
 people see your podcast, they see, wow,

2:03:13.880 --> 2:03:16.020
 like if they don't know you

2:03:16.020 --> 2:03:17.580
 and they don't know why you're interviewing him

2:03:17.580 --> 2:03:18.920
 and they don't listen, they'll see that

2:03:18.920 --> 2:03:22.320
 and then 100% think it's for the other reason.

2:03:22.320 --> 2:03:24.220
 But I'm also afraid of a society

2:03:24.220 --> 2:03:25.700
 where you can't have discourse

2:03:25.700 --> 2:03:29.000
 with people you disagree with

2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:31.100
 and even though I don't like Andrew Tate,

2:03:31.100 --> 2:03:33.840
 I think the fact that he got banned from all the platforms

2:03:33.840 --> 2:03:36.860
 is kind of scary because it sets a precedent

2:03:36.860 --> 2:03:38.160
 and you always have to ask yourself,

2:03:38.160 --> 2:03:40.660
 would this be ethical if I was on the other side

2:03:40.660 --> 2:03:42.620
 and even things with a president like Trump,

2:03:42.620 --> 2:03:45.700
 even if let's say you're somebody who was on the left,

2:03:45.700 --> 2:03:47.620
 if that would have happened to a leftist president,

2:03:47.620 --> 2:03:48.460
 how would you feel?

2:03:48.460 --> 2:03:49.860
 Would you think that's morally ethical?

2:03:49.860 --> 2:03:54.060
 So that is something that I think is important.

2:03:54.060 --> 2:03:56.380
 We try to find ways to have conversations

2:03:56.380 --> 2:03:59.100
 and reach some mutual understanding

2:03:59.100 --> 2:04:02.100
 and try instead of just amplifying the worst

2:04:02.100 --> 2:04:03.520
 about every human being.

2:04:04.620 --> 2:04:07.560
 Well, so one of the major reasons I'm struggling with

2:04:07.560 --> 2:04:11.580
 is because I really enjoy talking to brilliant women.

2:04:11.580 --> 2:04:14.860
 I think it's also, a lot of women reached out to me

2:04:14.860 --> 2:04:17.900
 saying like, it is what it is,

2:04:17.900 --> 2:04:20.060
 but they're inspired when the female guest is on.

2:04:20.060 --> 2:04:23.260
 And to me, if I talk to somebody like Andrew Tate,

2:04:23.260 --> 2:04:25.440
 even if I have a really hard hitting,

2:04:25.440 --> 2:04:28.300
 I think it could be a very good conversation

2:04:29.460 --> 2:04:32.340
 that lessens the likelihood

2:04:32.340 --> 2:04:37.340
 that a brilliant, powerful female will go on the show.

2:04:37.700 --> 2:04:39.820
 Because they'll never watch it,

2:04:39.820 --> 2:04:41.580
 but the thing we do in this society

2:04:41.580 --> 2:04:42.700
 is we put labels on each other.

2:04:42.700 --> 2:04:46.760
 Well, Lex is the person that platforms misogynists.

2:04:48.100 --> 2:04:53.100
 I did a thing where Joe Rogan got in trouble

2:04:53.340 --> 2:04:56.780
 over an N word controversy earlier in the year.

2:04:56.780 --> 2:04:58.740
 And Joe's a good friend of mine

2:04:58.740 --> 2:05:00.500
 and I said that I stand with Joe,

2:05:00.500 --> 2:05:02.900
 that he's not a racist or something like that.

2:05:02.900 --> 2:05:06.460
 And within certain communities,

2:05:06.460 --> 2:05:09.840
 I'm now somebody who's an apologist for racists, right?

2:05:09.840 --> 2:05:12.340
 Or a racist myself, that kind of thing.

2:05:12.340 --> 2:05:14.620
 And we put labels without ever listening to the content,

2:05:14.620 --> 2:05:17.060
 without ever sort of,

2:05:17.060 --> 2:05:19.540
 actually just even the very simple step

2:05:19.540 --> 2:05:21.680
 or it seems to be difficult of like,

2:05:25.360 --> 2:05:27.180
 taking on the best possible interpretation

2:05:27.180 --> 2:05:28.580
 of what a person said

2:05:28.580 --> 2:05:30.460
 and giving them the benefit of the doubt

2:05:30.460 --> 2:05:31.900
 and having empathy for another person.

2:05:31.900 --> 2:05:34.340
 So you have to play in this field

2:05:34.340 --> 2:05:36.700
 where people will assign labels to each other

2:05:36.700 --> 2:05:39.380
 and it's difficult.

2:05:39.380 --> 2:05:40.760
 But ultimately, I believe,

2:05:40.760 --> 2:05:45.020
 I hope that good conversations is a way

2:05:45.020 --> 2:05:46.780
 to like a greater understanding for people

2:05:46.780 --> 2:05:50.020
 to grow together as a society

2:05:50.020 --> 2:05:51.460
 and improve and learn the lessons,

2:05:51.460 --> 2:05:52.460
 the mistakes of the past.

2:05:52.460 --> 2:05:54.460
 But you also have to play this game

2:05:54.460 --> 2:05:56.820
 where people just like putting labels on each other

2:05:56.820 --> 2:05:58.540
 and canceling each other over those.

2:05:58.540 --> 2:06:01.580
 Or that guy said one thing nice about Donald Trump,

2:06:01.580 --> 2:06:04.860
 he must be a far right Nazi.

2:06:04.860 --> 2:06:06.300
 Or the opposite,

2:06:06.300 --> 2:06:11.020
 that this person said something nice about the vaccine,

2:06:11.020 --> 2:06:13.780
 he must be a far left whatever,

2:06:13.780 --> 2:06:18.780
 because apologist for whatever, for Fauci.

2:06:20.580 --> 2:06:23.240
 Or most of us I think are ultimately in the middle.

2:06:23.240 --> 2:06:25.540
 It's a weird, it's a weird thing.

2:06:25.540 --> 2:06:28.140
 But I think, and it's also painful on a personal level.

2:06:28.140 --> 2:06:32.020
 Like people have written to me

2:06:32.020 --> 2:06:35.100
 about things like single words,

2:06:35.100 --> 2:06:39.940
 half sentences that I've said about either Putin or Zelensky

2:06:39.940 --> 2:06:42.700
 where they have hate towards me because of what I said.

2:06:43.900 --> 2:06:45.300
 Either both directions.

2:06:45.300 --> 2:06:48.620
 I've now accumulated very passionate people

2:06:48.620 --> 2:06:52.140
 that some call me a Putin apologist,

2:06:52.140 --> 2:06:54.460
 some call me a Zelensky apologist.

2:06:54.460 --> 2:06:58.740
 And it hurts to, given how much I have family there,

2:06:58.740 --> 2:07:00.780
 how much I've seen of suffering there,

2:07:00.780 --> 2:07:02.620
 and to carry that burden over time

2:07:02.620 --> 2:07:04.560
 and not let it destroy you is tough.

2:07:04.560 --> 2:07:07.940
 So like, do you wanna take on another thing like that

2:07:07.940 --> 2:07:09.900
 when you have conversations?

2:07:09.900 --> 2:07:13.140
 Or can I just talk to awesome people like you two?

2:07:13.140 --> 2:07:14.260
 Where it's not that burden.

2:07:14.260 --> 2:07:16.140
 We're not controversial.

2:07:16.140 --> 2:07:17.660
 Or you're interesting, you're fascinating,

2:07:17.660 --> 2:07:21.000
 you're inspiring, you're like fun.

2:07:21.000 --> 2:07:24.980
 Not all those difficult things that come with more difficult

2:07:24.980 --> 2:07:25.820
 conversations.

2:07:25.820 --> 2:07:26.640
 Right.

2:07:26.640 --> 2:07:30.100
 But somebody has to be making those difficult decisions

2:07:30.100 --> 2:07:35.100
 and challenging the notions that we should cancel someone

2:07:35.160 --> 2:07:37.600
 just for slightly disagreeing with us.

2:07:37.600 --> 2:07:40.580
 And it's very hard to take that on personally.

2:07:40.580 --> 2:07:42.220
 And I think that's a huge part of it.

2:07:42.220 --> 2:07:44.220
 When you know it's something you're doing

2:07:44.220 --> 2:07:46.740
 for the right reasons and you're getting a lot of people

2:07:46.740 --> 2:07:51.740
 coming and misinterpreting it, it's very painful.

2:07:52.620 --> 2:07:56.340
 But I think you have to ask yourself long term

2:07:56.340 --> 2:07:58.700
 if when you made that decision, you ultimately thought

2:07:58.700 --> 2:08:01.380
 it would be better or worse for your listeners

2:08:01.380 --> 2:08:02.740
 to know that conversation.

2:08:02.740 --> 2:08:05.780
 And then if you can sleep with it at night, take the risk.

2:08:05.780 --> 2:08:08.540
 Yeah, actually when I talk to people that,

2:08:08.540 --> 2:08:10.460
 especially astrophysicists, and you realize

2:08:10.460 --> 2:08:11.680
 how tiny we are.

2:08:11.680 --> 2:08:12.520
 Right.

2:08:12.520 --> 2:08:14.620
 How incredible, like how huge the universe is.

2:08:14.620 --> 2:08:16.900
 Like you don't, it doesn't matter, you can do anything.

2:08:16.900 --> 2:08:20.820
 You could like, you can walk around naked,

2:08:20.820 --> 2:08:23.260
 talk shit to people, do whatever the hell.

2:08:23.260 --> 2:08:25.520
 And actually in modern social media,

2:08:25.520 --> 2:08:26.940
 people just like forget.

2:08:26.940 --> 2:08:29.100
 It's like, it's ultimately liberating.

2:08:29.100 --> 2:08:32.460
 Just try to do, at least from my perspective,

2:08:32.460 --> 2:08:34.660
 the best possible thing for the world you can.

2:08:34.660 --> 2:08:37.220
 Take big risks, and it doesn't matter.

2:08:37.220 --> 2:08:39.540
 And that's the other thing with being canceled nowadays

2:08:39.540 --> 2:08:43.300
 because everyone's attention is much more shortsighted.

2:08:43.300 --> 2:08:46.060
 You can get canceled and then it'll blow over in three days.

2:08:46.060 --> 2:08:48.340
 And you actually see things like this on Twitch very often

2:08:48.340 --> 2:08:51.180
 where people just have bursts of outrage

2:08:51.180 --> 2:08:53.200
 and they come into your chat and they're all spamming

2:08:53.200 --> 2:08:55.600
 and saying mean things, and then three days after.

2:08:55.600 --> 2:08:57.880
 And of course they're not actually ever serious things.

2:08:57.880 --> 2:09:00.020
 They're usually like things clipped of any streamers

2:09:00.020 --> 2:09:01.980
 in like their worst moments, but then people forget

2:09:01.980 --> 2:09:03.780
 about it pretty soon after.

2:09:04.900 --> 2:09:06.900
 So you're able to accept that?

2:09:06.900 --> 2:09:09.820
 Like when somebody is being shitty to you for a day?

2:09:09.820 --> 2:09:12.720
 Yeah, I mean, I still get sometimes emotional about it,

2:09:12.720 --> 2:09:14.500
 especially when I'm like, oh wow,

2:09:14.500 --> 2:09:16.660
 these things that are being said are not true

2:09:16.660 --> 2:09:19.220
 or like this was clearly taken out of context,

2:09:19.220 --> 2:09:22.380
 but I've just accepted that it's part of the job.

2:09:22.380 --> 2:09:26.780
 And if I am trying my best and I am trying things

2:09:26.780 --> 2:09:29.180
 with as good intentions as possible,

2:09:29.180 --> 2:09:31.040
 then I just try to learn every time that happens

2:09:31.040 --> 2:09:32.820
 and be like, okay, what could I do better?

2:09:32.820 --> 2:09:34.740
 And what is just part of the job?

2:09:35.700 --> 2:09:37.140
 Well, let's start some controversy.

2:09:37.140 --> 2:09:39.340
 Who's the greatest chess player of all time?

2:09:39.340 --> 2:09:43.260
 Is it Magnus Carlsen, is it Gary Kasparov,

2:09:43.260 --> 2:09:45.340
 is it somebody else, Bobby Fischer?

2:09:46.200 --> 2:09:48.300
 Do you have a favorite, Alex?

2:09:48.300 --> 2:09:50.780
 So whenever I hear this question,

2:09:50.780 --> 2:09:53.700
 I interpret it in a very specific way

2:09:53.700 --> 2:09:57.300
 where it's not who was the most talented chess player

2:09:57.300 --> 2:09:59.240
 or who had the most impact on the chess world,

2:09:59.240 --> 2:10:02.860
 but who is the greatest at playing chess?

2:10:02.860 --> 2:10:05.420
 Where if you were putting all of these players

2:10:05.420 --> 2:10:07.960
 at their peak, who would be the best?

2:10:07.960 --> 2:10:11.460
 And we're kind of living in a world

2:10:11.460 --> 2:10:14.140
 where obviously humans are becoming more like cyborgs

2:10:14.140 --> 2:10:17.220
 and their tools make them a lot more powerful.

2:10:18.480 --> 2:10:21.460
 And the computer is the most powerful tool

2:10:21.460 --> 2:10:23.500
 for chess that we've ever witnessed.

2:10:23.500 --> 2:10:26.540
 And the top players now, someone like Magnus Carlsen

2:10:26.540 --> 2:10:30.100
 or Gary Kasparov, if they were gonna go towards people

2:10:30.100 --> 2:10:35.100
 like even Lasker or Bobby Fischer back in the day,

2:10:35.100 --> 2:10:38.060
 Lasker, he was world champion for 27 years,

2:10:38.060 --> 2:10:40.080
 he was the best in his field by far,

2:10:40.080 --> 2:10:41.640
 but would he be able to stand up to someone

2:10:41.640 --> 2:10:44.220
 like Magnus Carlsen who has had these tools?

2:10:44.220 --> 2:10:45.580
 I don't think so.

2:10:45.580 --> 2:10:49.680
 So most chess players have said Gary Kasparov

2:10:49.680 --> 2:10:52.460
 and I think even Magnus has said that in the past,

2:10:52.460 --> 2:10:55.320
 but I like to think of it as Magnus in his peak

2:10:55.320 --> 2:10:57.600
 and Gary at his peak, and because Magnus was able

2:10:57.600 --> 2:10:59.400
 to live more in a computer era,

2:10:59.400 --> 2:11:02.560
 I feel like so far he's the greatest of all time.

2:11:02.560 --> 2:11:04.000
 And some studies say things like

2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:05.760
 how there's rating inflation,

2:11:05.760 --> 2:11:06.960
 but I looked into some of them

2:11:06.960 --> 2:11:11.400
 and they basically calculated people's play

2:11:11.400 --> 2:11:13.240
 over the years and it seems

2:11:13.240 --> 2:11:14.340
 that there hasn't been inflation,

2:11:14.340 --> 2:11:15.360
 people are just getting better

2:11:15.360 --> 2:11:18.320
 and I think it's because you have better tools at chess.

2:11:18.320 --> 2:11:21.040
 And also one of the cases, what's your?

2:11:21.040 --> 2:11:24.520
 I was gonna say, I actually, I disagree with that.

2:11:24.520 --> 2:11:26.460
 Good, make it interesting.

2:11:26.460 --> 2:11:31.460
 I think I would judge the greatest player of all time

2:11:31.600 --> 2:11:33.680
 in relative to the time that they lived in

2:11:33.680 --> 2:11:36.680
 and Magnus, although he is technically

2:11:36.680 --> 2:11:38.440
 the strongest chess player in history,

2:11:38.440 --> 2:11:41.960
 that is because he had computers to study chess with.

2:11:41.960 --> 2:11:45.680
 And of course, if you compare him to like Gary Kasparov,

2:11:45.680 --> 2:11:47.840
 he plays most like Stockfish,

2:11:47.840 --> 2:11:49.680
 but Gary Kasparov at his time,

2:11:49.680 --> 2:11:53.720
 he beat more players of his skill level than Magnus did.

2:11:53.720 --> 2:11:55.320
 Magnus loses more often.

2:11:55.320 --> 2:11:57.680
 He also of course held the belt for 20 years more.

2:11:57.680 --> 2:12:01.120
 So I'd say actually, because Gary lacked the help

2:12:01.120 --> 2:12:03.500
 of computers to study chess

2:12:03.500 --> 2:12:06.580
 and overall performed better against players

2:12:06.580 --> 2:12:09.280
 of his skill level, I think he would be number one.

2:12:09.280 --> 2:12:10.340
 Nice.

2:12:10.340 --> 2:12:13.280
 Yeah, but I mean, the case that people make for Magnus

2:12:13.280 --> 2:12:16.360
 on many, I mean, what Alex said,

2:12:16.360 --> 2:12:20.240
 but also Magnus plays a lot and he doesn't,

2:12:21.080 --> 2:12:24.960
 he plays a lot blitz, bullet and like he puts,

2:12:25.840 --> 2:12:29.520
 he gets drunk and like he's really putting himself out there

2:12:29.520 --> 2:12:32.500
 and in all kinds of conditions and he's able to dominate

2:12:32.500 --> 2:12:35.720
 and a lot of them, we get to see many of the like losses

2:12:35.720 --> 2:12:37.020
 or blunders and all that kind of stuff

2:12:37.020 --> 2:12:39.000
 because he just puts himself out there.

2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:42.500
 And I think Kasparov was much more like.

2:12:42.500 --> 2:12:44.160
 Never saw him play drunk, right?

2:12:44.160 --> 2:12:47.100
 Yeah, and it's very focused on the world championship.

2:12:47.100 --> 2:12:51.140
 It's very, very limited number of games

2:12:51.140 --> 2:12:52.580
 and very focused on winning.

2:12:52.580 --> 2:12:56.120
 And so there's some aspect to the versatility,

2:12:56.120 --> 2:12:59.380
 the aggressive play, the fun, all of that,

2:12:59.380 --> 2:13:01.800
 that I think you have to give credit to.

2:13:01.800 --> 2:13:02.800
 Oh, 100%.

2:13:02.800 --> 2:13:06.480
 In terms of just the scope,

2:13:06.480 --> 2:13:10.760
 the scale of the variety of genius exhibited by Magnus.

2:13:10.760 --> 2:13:12.300
 And he might not even be done yet.

2:13:12.300 --> 2:13:14.680
 I don't know if he'll ever hit 2,900,

2:13:14.680 --> 2:13:16.640
 but we can't judge yet

2:13:16.640 --> 2:13:18.960
 because he's not at the peak of his career potentially.

2:13:18.960 --> 2:13:20.920
 What do you think about him not playing world championship?

2:13:20.920 --> 2:13:23.080
 Isn't that like, isn't that wild?

2:13:23.080 --> 2:13:26.800
 The entirety of the history of chess in the 20th century

2:13:26.800 --> 2:13:27.720
 going like meh.

2:13:27.720 --> 2:13:31.720
 It's walking away from this one tournament

2:13:31.720 --> 2:13:34.320
 that seems to be at the center of chess.

2:13:35.600 --> 2:13:37.400
 What do you think about that decision?

2:13:37.400 --> 2:13:41.440
 I mean, you can't help but be disappointed as a chess fan

2:13:41.440 --> 2:13:43.560
 who wants to see the best player in the world

2:13:43.560 --> 2:13:44.980
 defend his title.

2:13:44.980 --> 2:13:48.720
 But I also understand it on a personal level

2:13:48.720 --> 2:13:51.360
 and not feeling as satisfied

2:13:51.360 --> 2:13:53.820
 when you're going to the world championship

2:13:53.820 --> 2:13:55.740
 and having to defend against people

2:13:55.740 --> 2:13:57.360
 who are less strong than you.

2:13:57.360 --> 2:13:59.600
 And also imagine winning world championships

2:13:59.600 --> 2:14:01.720
 and not feeling a joy out of that.

2:14:02.720 --> 2:14:04.720
 So maybe by not doing that

2:14:04.720 --> 2:14:07.200
 and focusing instead on a goal like 2,900,

2:14:07.200 --> 2:14:09.200
 he'll be more likely to accomplish it

2:14:09.200 --> 2:14:12.520
 because he's focusing on what actually motivates him

2:14:12.520 --> 2:14:13.580
 to play chess.

2:14:13.580 --> 2:14:17.760
 But I do think that it will hurt

2:14:17.760 --> 2:14:20.520
 how we judge the next world champion.

2:14:21.400 --> 2:14:23.960
 I think it won't change him being the best player

2:14:23.960 --> 2:14:25.000
 in the world.

2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:27.360
 And for someone to replace him,

2:14:27.360 --> 2:14:29.940
 even let's say like Nepo versus Sting,

2:14:29.940 --> 2:14:32.960
 even if one of them win and right on some stance,

2:14:32.960 --> 2:14:34.600
 it does lower the merit

2:14:34.600 --> 2:14:37.740
 because now who has the world chess championship title

2:14:37.740 --> 2:14:39.640
 isn't actually the best player in the world.

2:14:39.640 --> 2:14:41.720
 And that has happened before in the past,

2:14:41.720 --> 2:14:45.480
 but still going to take the same effort to prove

2:14:45.480 --> 2:14:48.120
 when they would pass him like 10, 20 years

2:14:48.120 --> 2:14:49.520
 to become stronger than Magnus.

2:14:49.520 --> 2:14:51.260
 So I don't think it changes the skill level

2:14:51.260 --> 2:14:54.220
 that it takes to become the best chess player in the world.

2:14:54.220 --> 2:14:56.760
 I think for chess fans, it's very disappointing,

2:14:56.760 --> 2:14:58.700
 but I think in the overall like grand scheme

2:14:58.700 --> 2:15:01.680
 of like the public view to people who don't really,

2:15:01.680 --> 2:15:04.680
 so like, you know, what breaks the popular culture

2:15:04.680 --> 2:15:08.280
 and you think of what names people know

2:15:08.280 --> 2:15:10.620
 who don't play chess like Bobby Fischer did it.

2:15:10.620 --> 2:15:12.320
 Most people know Casper over Magnus.

2:15:12.320 --> 2:15:15.480
 It takes the same ability and talent and that doesn't change.

2:15:15.480 --> 2:15:16.980
 I think it does change though

2:15:16.980 --> 2:15:20.360
 if you're playing a player who's not as strong,

2:15:20.360 --> 2:15:22.300
 but I see your point as well.

2:15:22.300 --> 2:15:23.840
 And I know we differ on this.

2:15:23.840 --> 2:15:25.240
 Like I said, I heard you ask Magnus,

2:15:25.240 --> 2:15:26.600
 but what is your take on it?

2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:33.920
 Well, listen, his answer is kind of brilliant,

2:15:33.920 --> 2:15:37.440
 which he's not saying he's bored

2:15:37.440 --> 2:15:39.040
 of the world championship.

2:15:39.040 --> 2:15:41.680
 He's bored of a process

2:15:41.680 --> 2:15:44.320
 that doesn't determine the best player.

2:15:44.320 --> 2:15:47.120
 Like, and it's too exciting inducing to him

2:15:47.120 --> 2:15:50.040
 to have a small number of games.

2:15:50.040 --> 2:15:54.800
 He doesn't mind losing, which is really fascinating

2:15:54.800 --> 2:15:58.600
 to a better player or somebody who is his level.

2:15:58.600 --> 2:16:03.600
 He's more anxious about losing to a weaker player

2:16:05.000 --> 2:16:07.160
 because of the small sample size.

2:16:07.160 --> 2:16:09.840
 Now, if like poker players had that anxiety,

2:16:09.840 --> 2:16:11.600
 they would never play at all, right?

2:16:11.600 --> 2:16:13.360
 That's the World Series of Poker.

2:16:13.360 --> 2:16:17.560
 You get to lose against weaker players all the time.

2:16:17.560 --> 2:16:19.400
 That's the throw of the dice.

2:16:19.400 --> 2:16:21.960
 But that's an interesting perspective

2:16:21.960 --> 2:16:25.160
 that he would love to play 20, 30, 40 games

2:16:25.160 --> 2:16:26.120
 in the world championship,

2:16:26.120 --> 2:16:28.160
 and then he would enjoy it much more.

2:16:28.160 --> 2:16:29.960
 And also play shorter games

2:16:29.960 --> 2:16:34.600
 because they emphasize the like pure chess,

2:16:34.600 --> 2:16:39.600
 actually being able to like much more variety

2:16:40.480 --> 2:16:42.760
 in the middle game just to see a bunch of chaos

2:16:42.760 --> 2:16:43.960
 and see how you're able to compute,

2:16:43.960 --> 2:16:46.480
 calculate and intuition, all that kind of stuff.

2:16:46.480 --> 2:16:48.200
 I mean, that's beautiful.

2:16:48.200 --> 2:16:51.600
 I wish the chess world would step up and meet him

2:16:51.600 --> 2:16:53.360
 in a place that makes sense,

2:16:55.280 --> 2:16:56.560
 change the world championship.

2:16:56.560 --> 2:17:00.480
 So FIDE changing it somehow, a loss for that.

2:17:00.480 --> 2:17:03.600
 Or having other really respected tournaments

2:17:03.600 --> 2:17:06.480
 that become like an annual thing that step up to that.

2:17:07.400 --> 2:17:12.120
 Or more kind of online YouTube type of competitions,

2:17:12.120 --> 2:17:14.560
 which I think they're trying to do more and more,

2:17:14.560 --> 2:17:16.440
 like the Crypto Cup and all those kinds of things.

2:17:16.440 --> 2:17:19.240
 And the Grand Tour does play in,

2:17:19.240 --> 2:17:21.120
 which takes a lot of the top players

2:17:21.120 --> 2:17:23.760
 and they do it online in shorter formats.

2:17:23.760 --> 2:17:26.280
 But there's, so that's his perspective.

2:17:26.280 --> 2:17:30.320
 My perhaps narrow perspective

2:17:30.320 --> 2:17:32.360
 is I romanticize the Olympic games

2:17:32.360 --> 2:17:33.680
 and those are every four years

2:17:33.680 --> 2:17:38.200
 and the world championships because they're rare,

2:17:38.200 --> 2:17:40.440
 because the sample size is so small.

2:17:40.440 --> 2:17:42.200
 That's where the magic happens.

2:17:42.200 --> 2:17:45.760
 Everything's on the line for people

2:17:45.760 --> 2:17:50.520
 that spend their whole life, 20 years of dedication,

2:17:50.520 --> 2:17:52.800
 everything you have, every minute of the day

2:17:52.800 --> 2:17:54.920
 spent for that moment.

2:17:54.920 --> 2:17:57.560
 You think about like gymnastics at the Olympic games.

2:17:57.560 --> 2:17:59.720
 There's certain sports where a single mistake

2:17:59.720 --> 2:18:01.280
 and you're fucked.

2:18:01.280 --> 2:18:06.280
 And that stress, that pressure, it can break people

2:18:08.880 --> 2:18:11.160
 or it can create magic.

2:18:11.160 --> 2:18:13.520
 Like a person that's the underdog

2:18:13.520 --> 2:18:15.520
 has the best night of their life

2:18:15.520 --> 2:18:18.200
 or the person that's been dominating for years

2:18:18.200 --> 2:18:19.840
 all of a sudden slips up.

2:18:19.840 --> 2:18:22.080
 That drama from a human perspective is beautiful.

2:18:22.080 --> 2:18:24.560
 So I still like the world championships,

2:18:24.560 --> 2:18:28.320
 but then again, looking at all the draws,

2:18:28.320 --> 2:18:33.320
 looking at like, well, the magic isn't quite there.

2:18:33.760 --> 2:18:36.440
 So to me, when I see faster games of chess,

2:18:36.440 --> 2:18:39.360
 that's much more beautiful.

2:18:39.360 --> 2:18:41.520
 But then I don't understand the game of chess

2:18:41.520 --> 2:18:43.200
 deeply enough to know.

2:18:43.200 --> 2:18:48.200
 Like, does it have to be so many draws?

2:18:48.880 --> 2:18:51.440
 Like, is there a way to create a more dynamic chess?

2:18:51.440 --> 2:18:53.800
 And he talked about random chess

2:18:53.800 --> 2:18:55.400
 with a random starting position.

2:18:55.400 --> 2:18:56.240
 That's really interesting.

2:18:56.240 --> 2:18:58.440
 But then of course, that's like,

2:18:58.440 --> 2:19:00.520
 then you do have to play hundreds of games

2:19:00.520 --> 2:19:01.840
 and that kind of stuff.

2:19:03.280 --> 2:19:07.280
 But I think it's great that the world number one

2:19:08.240 --> 2:19:12.440
 is struggling with these questions

2:19:12.440 --> 2:19:13.840
 because he's in the position,

2:19:13.840 --> 2:19:16.800
 he has the leverage to actually change the game of chess

2:19:16.800 --> 2:19:19.480
 as it's publicly seen, as it's publicly played.

2:19:19.480 --> 2:19:21.960
 So it's interesting.

2:19:21.960 --> 2:19:24.160
 He's still young enough to dominate

2:19:24.160 --> 2:19:26.280
 for quite a long time if he wants.

2:19:26.280 --> 2:19:27.280
 So I don't know.

2:19:27.280 --> 2:19:32.120
 I, you know, with Kasparov, the fight between nations,

2:19:32.120 --> 2:19:34.760
 I hope they have the world championship

2:19:34.760 --> 2:19:38.560
 and I hope he's still a part of it somehow.

2:19:38.560 --> 2:19:40.360
 I hope he changes his mind.

2:19:40.360 --> 2:19:41.200
 And comes back.

2:19:41.200 --> 2:19:42.040
 Comes back.

2:19:42.040 --> 2:19:43.080
 Kind of dramatic thing.

2:19:43.080 --> 2:19:44.680
 I don't know.

2:19:44.680 --> 2:19:47.880
 But it is, his heart is not in it.

2:19:47.880 --> 2:19:48.720
 And then,

2:19:51.680 --> 2:19:54.520
 and then that's not beautiful to see, right?

2:19:57.720 --> 2:20:02.000
 Yeah, it is beautiful that the thing he wants

2:20:02.000 --> 2:20:04.440
 is a great game of chess against an opponent

2:20:04.440 --> 2:20:06.160
 that's his level or better.

2:20:07.200 --> 2:20:10.120
 And that's great that he's coming from that place.

2:20:10.120 --> 2:20:11.920
 But I hope he comes back tomorrow.

2:20:11.920 --> 2:20:15.400
 Because the world championship is a special thing

2:20:15.400 --> 2:20:16.960
 in any sport.

2:20:16.960 --> 2:20:18.560
 So you do wish that the person

2:20:18.560 --> 2:20:20.040
 who wins the world championship

2:20:20.040 --> 2:20:21.760
 is the best player in the world?

2:20:23.640 --> 2:20:24.720
 No.

2:20:25.800 --> 2:20:28.640
 I hope that the best people in the world,

2:20:28.640 --> 2:20:30.120
 the two best people in the world

2:20:30.120 --> 2:20:31.720
 are the ones that sit down.

2:20:33.160 --> 2:20:35.840
 But the person that wins is the person that,

2:20:35.840 --> 2:20:37.200
 that's the magic of it.

2:20:37.200 --> 2:20:39.160
 Nobody knows who's going to win.

2:20:39.160 --> 2:20:42.640
 I think Magnus is so, he really wants

2:20:42.640 --> 2:20:44.120
 the best person to win.

2:20:44.120 --> 2:20:48.480
 Like the, that's why he wants the large sample size.

2:20:48.480 --> 2:20:50.440
 But to me there's some magic to it.

2:20:50.440 --> 2:20:53.360
 The stress of it, the drama of it.

2:20:53.360 --> 2:20:55.280
 That's all part of the game.

2:20:55.280 --> 2:20:58.120
 Like it's not just about the purity of the game,

2:20:58.120 --> 2:21:00.520
 like the calculation.

2:21:00.520 --> 2:21:01.760
 The pure chess of it.

2:21:01.760 --> 2:21:03.840
 It's also like the drama.

2:21:03.840 --> 2:21:07.760
 Like the, yeah, the pressure, the drama, all of it.

2:21:07.760 --> 2:21:10.760
 The shit talking, if it gets to you, the mind games.

2:21:10.760 --> 2:21:12.560
 This is the part that's fun to watch,

2:21:12.560 --> 2:21:14.480
 but less fun to be playing.

2:21:14.480 --> 2:21:15.720
 But that's why it's great.

2:21:15.720 --> 2:21:18.640
 Who can melt, who can rise under that pressure

2:21:18.640 --> 2:21:20.280
 and who melts under that pressure.

2:21:22.520 --> 2:21:24.160
 There's a lot of people that look up to you,

2:21:24.160 --> 2:21:26.200
 like they're inspired by you

2:21:26.200 --> 2:21:28.720
 because you've taken a kind of nonlinear path through life.

2:21:28.720 --> 2:21:31.000
 Is there any advice you have for people

2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:32.440
 like in high school today?

2:21:33.800 --> 2:21:35.760
 They're trying to figure out what they want to do.

2:21:35.760 --> 2:21:37.040
 Do they want to go to Stanford?

2:21:37.040 --> 2:21:41.360
 Do they want to pursue a career in, I don't know,

2:21:41.360 --> 2:21:46.000
 in industry or go kind of the path you guys have taken,

2:21:46.000 --> 2:21:48.480
 which is have the ability to do all of that

2:21:48.480 --> 2:21:50.680
 and still choose to make the thing

2:21:50.680 --> 2:21:52.680
 that you're passionate about your life.

2:21:53.600 --> 2:21:56.760
 I always liked the calculated risks approach

2:21:56.760 --> 2:22:00.360
 where when you're younger, it's okay to take more risks

2:22:00.360 --> 2:22:02.360
 because you have a lot more time,

2:22:02.360 --> 2:22:04.040
 but there has to be a reason

2:22:04.040 --> 2:22:06.120
 why you're doing that particular risk.

2:22:06.120 --> 2:22:08.400
 Is it something that you've spent a lot of time already

2:22:08.400 --> 2:22:09.880
 really passionate and working on

2:22:09.880 --> 2:22:11.320
 or is it just something that's trendy

2:22:11.320 --> 2:22:13.880
 and you want to do it because you don't have a better option?

2:22:13.880 --> 2:22:16.360
 And that's actually similar to what Andrea did

2:22:16.360 --> 2:22:19.520
 when she decided to go into streaming instead of school.

2:22:19.520 --> 2:22:21.920
 Yeah, the reason I got into streaming

2:22:21.920 --> 2:22:24.240
 because I was initially going to go to college,

2:22:24.240 --> 2:22:25.440
 but the pandemics,

2:22:25.440 --> 2:22:27.280
 it was right at the beginning of the pandemic

2:22:27.280 --> 2:22:29.320
 and all my classes were online.

2:22:29.320 --> 2:22:31.960
 And I never thought, ever since I was 12,

2:22:31.960 --> 2:22:36.200
 like my dream was school and I saw myself nowhere else

2:22:36.200 --> 2:22:37.960
 than going to university.

2:22:37.960 --> 2:22:40.440
 And I thought of it and kind of weighed out the risks.

2:22:40.440 --> 2:22:41.760
 I'm like, well, if I take a gap year

2:22:41.760 --> 2:22:45.160
 and I try streaming with my sister, what do I have to lose?

2:22:45.160 --> 2:22:47.400
 I gained some experience working with someone

2:22:47.400 --> 2:22:49.880
 who has a lot more experience than I do.

2:22:49.880 --> 2:22:52.360
 And then I can go back to school after.

2:22:52.360 --> 2:22:54.000
 And if I go to school right now,

2:22:54.000 --> 2:22:55.480
 I do online classes for a year

2:22:55.480 --> 2:22:57.400
 and that's something that I could do at any time.

2:22:57.400 --> 2:23:00.920
 So that's why it made a lot of sense for me to go into this.

2:23:00.920 --> 2:23:04.240
 But of course, this is also a very unique opportunity.

2:23:04.240 --> 2:23:05.560
 So I don't know how applicable,

2:23:05.560 --> 2:23:07.680
 but I do think overall the calculated risk

2:23:07.680 --> 2:23:08.560
 is a really good lesson.

2:23:08.560 --> 2:23:10.360
 So life is like chess.

2:23:10.360 --> 2:23:11.760
 Exactly.

2:23:11.760 --> 2:23:12.840
 Maybe sometime.

2:23:12.840 --> 2:23:13.840
 Exactly.

2:23:13.840 --> 2:23:15.920
 You also, have you considered a career

2:23:15.920 --> 2:23:16.840
 in professional fighting?

2:23:16.840 --> 2:23:18.800
 I saw you did a self defense class,

2:23:18.800 --> 2:23:20.280
 you did a little Jiu Jitsu.

2:23:20.280 --> 2:23:22.840
 Did you see the 10 year old kid who...

2:23:22.840 --> 2:23:24.240
 Throwing her?

2:23:24.240 --> 2:23:26.480
 Yes, and apparently I could have broken a leg.

2:23:26.480 --> 2:23:29.360
 But it's actually funny, like chess boxing is a thing

2:23:29.360 --> 2:23:32.280
 and I have been doing a lot of boxing.

2:23:32.280 --> 2:23:34.160
 Physical activity is like, honestly,

2:23:34.160 --> 2:23:35.960
 one of my favorite things to do.

2:23:35.960 --> 2:23:38.240
 And I have been testing it out on content

2:23:38.240 --> 2:23:40.000
 and we have a creator friend

2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:42.040
 who's hosting a chess boxing tournament,

2:23:42.040 --> 2:23:45.760
 but there's no woman who could match me, unfortunately,

2:23:45.760 --> 2:23:47.680
 because all the opponents are male

2:23:47.680 --> 2:23:50.120
 and I can't fight a guy.

2:23:50.120 --> 2:23:51.680
 How does chess boxing work?

2:23:51.680 --> 2:23:54.120
 So you do a round of chess and a round of boxing.

2:23:54.120 --> 2:23:56.520
 And we actually did a training camp for it before.

2:23:56.520 --> 2:23:59.400
 And of course, after you go into the ring.

2:23:59.400 --> 2:24:00.240
 Is this real?

2:24:00.240 --> 2:24:01.080
 Is this serious?

2:24:01.080 --> 2:24:01.920
 Yes, it's amazing.

2:24:01.920 --> 2:24:03.320
 We went to a London chess boxing club.

2:24:03.320 --> 2:24:04.160
 And after you get...

2:24:04.160 --> 2:24:05.120
 No, it seemed like videos,

2:24:05.120 --> 2:24:06.680
 I thought it was something you'd just do in Russia

2:24:06.680 --> 2:24:07.520
 or something.

2:24:07.520 --> 2:24:08.360
 No, it's a real sport.

2:24:08.360 --> 2:24:09.200
 It's a real sport.

2:24:09.200 --> 2:24:10.440
 Yeah, no, it's very cool.

2:24:10.440 --> 2:24:12.320
 But after you get really tired,

2:24:12.320 --> 2:24:14.000
 you're more likely to make a mistake

2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:16.040
 and they call them Jaffers or something.

2:24:16.040 --> 2:24:17.360
 Yeah, there's probably good strategies,

2:24:17.360 --> 2:24:19.360
 like what do you want to...

2:24:19.360 --> 2:24:21.320
 Because some of it is a cardio thing.

2:24:21.320 --> 2:24:23.760
 Do you want to work on your chess or your boxing?

2:24:23.760 --> 2:24:25.560
 They do both, it's very fun.

2:24:25.560 --> 2:24:27.120
 But yeah, from a content perspective,

2:24:27.120 --> 2:24:31.960
 I'm sure there's a lot of people that would love to see.

2:24:31.960 --> 2:24:33.800
 I don't want to see Andrea getting hit.

2:24:33.800 --> 2:24:34.640
 That would be...

2:24:34.640 --> 2:24:35.480
 I would love to fight.

2:24:35.480 --> 2:24:37.760
 Unless she doesn't get hit.

2:24:37.760 --> 2:24:39.640
 Our roommate fought in a fight

2:24:39.640 --> 2:24:40.960
 and she did end up winning,

2:24:40.960 --> 2:24:42.320
 but seeing her get hit,

2:24:42.320 --> 2:24:43.840
 I thought I was going to throw up off screen.

2:24:43.840 --> 2:24:44.920
 I just think it was so cool.

2:24:44.920 --> 2:24:47.120
 She had no experience in boxing whatsoever.

2:24:47.120 --> 2:24:49.520
 And then coming from someone in the content world,

2:24:49.520 --> 2:24:52.120
 where you start waking up six days a week at 6 a.m.

2:24:52.120 --> 2:24:54.120
 and she's training every day,

2:24:54.120 --> 2:24:55.840
 like a real professional athlete,

2:24:55.840 --> 2:24:58.240
 I think like it's such a unique experience

2:24:58.240 --> 2:25:00.000
 and also like a really test

2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:02.880
 of how much you can really commit to this and progress.

2:25:02.880 --> 2:25:05.120
 And I think that's really rewarding.

2:25:05.120 --> 2:25:08.320
 Did you ever end up doing the marathon with David Goggins

2:25:08.320 --> 2:25:09.160
 that you were training for?

2:25:09.160 --> 2:25:11.840
 No, I got injured, but we're going to do it soon.

2:25:11.840 --> 2:25:14.080
 That's on my bucket list,

2:25:14.080 --> 2:25:15.560
 just to see what your limits are.

2:25:15.560 --> 2:25:16.400
 You're ready to do it?

2:25:16.400 --> 2:25:18.200
 What did you do leading up to this?

2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:19.840
 Nothing.

2:25:19.840 --> 2:25:20.680
 You're just going to go into it.

2:25:20.680 --> 2:25:22.240
 It's mental anyway.

2:25:22.240 --> 2:25:23.080
 Oh, you don't...

2:25:23.080 --> 2:25:25.240
 I run a lot to make sure like there's no...

2:25:27.520 --> 2:25:29.920
 You have to have a base level of fitness

2:25:29.920 --> 2:25:32.240
 to make sure your body doesn't completely freak out.

2:25:32.240 --> 2:25:36.200
 But other than that, 50 plus miles is just about

2:25:36.200 --> 2:25:39.440
 like taking it one step at a time

2:25:39.440 --> 2:25:42.160
 and just being able to deal with the suffering

2:25:42.160 --> 2:25:43.720
 and all the voices, the little voices

2:25:43.720 --> 2:25:44.880
 that tell you all the excuses,

2:25:44.880 --> 2:25:47.320
 like why are you doing this?

2:25:47.320 --> 2:25:49.680
 This blister is bleeding, whatever.

2:25:49.680 --> 2:25:53.360
 Whatever the thing that makes you want to stop,

2:25:53.360 --> 2:25:54.200
 just shut it off.

2:25:54.200 --> 2:25:56.880
 Sometimes it feels like you like pain.

2:25:56.880 --> 2:26:00.120
 No, well, no, no.

2:26:00.120 --> 2:26:05.120
 But the pain does seem to show the way to progress.

2:26:05.440 --> 2:26:06.280
 So what...

2:26:06.280 --> 2:26:08.040
 In your turn of life.

2:26:08.040 --> 2:26:08.880
 In my world.

2:26:08.880 --> 2:26:11.600
 Something that's really hard and I don't want to do,

2:26:11.600 --> 2:26:14.080
 that's usually the right thing to do.

2:26:14.080 --> 2:26:17.960
 And I'm not saying that's like a universal truth.

2:26:17.960 --> 2:26:22.040
 It's just, if there's a few doors to go into,

2:26:22.040 --> 2:26:24.320
 the one that I want to go into least,

2:26:24.320 --> 2:26:27.320
 that's the one that usually is the right one.

2:26:27.320 --> 2:26:29.880
 Afterwards, I will learn something from it.

2:26:29.880 --> 2:26:31.880
 The David Goggins thing, I don't know.

2:26:31.880 --> 2:26:34.640
 Listen, we're talking offline,

2:26:34.640 --> 2:26:36.000
 the conversation with Liv,

2:26:36.000 --> 2:26:38.680
 she has a very numeric, calculated risk.

2:26:38.680 --> 2:26:39.720
 Everything is planned.

2:26:39.720 --> 2:26:41.240
 I go with the heart.

2:26:41.240 --> 2:26:42.880
 I just go whatever the hell.

2:26:42.880 --> 2:26:44.840
 I think two years ago, I woke up,

2:26:44.840 --> 2:26:49.840
 it was summer, I decided to tweet,

2:26:50.400 --> 2:26:53.320
 I will do as many pushups.

2:26:53.320 --> 2:26:55.600
 I don't know why I did this,

2:26:55.600 --> 2:26:58.240
 but I will do as many pushups and pull ups

2:26:58.240 --> 2:27:00.400
 as this week gets likes, something like that.

2:27:00.400 --> 2:27:01.240
 Okay.

2:27:01.240 --> 2:27:02.080
 Right?

2:27:02.080 --> 2:27:05.840
 And then that it got like 30,000.

2:27:07.160 --> 2:27:08.360
 Once you put it out on the internet,

2:27:08.360 --> 2:27:09.200
 you're held accountable.

2:27:09.200 --> 2:27:11.560
 Well, for myself, I mean, in some sense.

2:27:11.560 --> 2:27:14.920
 And then that's when, I already was connected to David

2:27:14.920 --> 2:27:17.000
 at that point, but that's when he called me.

2:27:18.040 --> 2:27:19.800
 And then didn't have to do it.

2:27:19.800 --> 2:27:21.680
 And then I did it and it was one of the hardest things

2:27:21.680 --> 2:27:22.520
 I've ever done.

2:27:22.520 --> 2:27:23.360
 How long did you take?

2:27:23.360 --> 2:27:25.960
 I did it for seven days and I got injured.

2:27:25.960 --> 2:27:27.680
 So I did about a few thousand.

2:27:27.680 --> 2:27:29.840
 Wait, so this is what got you to be injured?

2:27:29.840 --> 2:27:30.920
 This challenge?

2:27:30.920 --> 2:27:31.760
 No, it's different.

2:27:31.760 --> 2:27:34.320
 I keep getting injured doing stuff.

2:27:34.320 --> 2:27:36.560
 But this particular thing, I started doing the,

2:27:36.560 --> 2:27:39.080
 you don't realize that you have to really ramp up.

2:27:39.080 --> 2:27:44.080
 So I got like overuse injury tendonitis on the shoulder

2:27:44.480 --> 2:27:46.000
 all the way down to the elbow.

2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:49.880
 So I took like eight or nine days off

2:27:49.880 --> 2:27:51.080
 and then started again.

2:27:51.080 --> 2:27:55.720
 And then it took about 31 days to do.

2:27:55.720 --> 2:27:57.280
 30,000.

2:27:57.280 --> 2:28:01.560
 The number was like 26, 27,000.

2:28:01.560 --> 2:28:02.400
 Yeah.

2:28:02.400 --> 2:28:03.240
 Wow.

2:28:03.240 --> 2:28:06.200
 And it took like three, four hours a day.

2:28:06.200 --> 2:28:07.160
 Oh God.

2:28:07.160 --> 2:28:08.000
 Yeah.

2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:08.880
 Sounds like torture.

2:28:08.880 --> 2:28:11.440
 And not, you know, constantly asking myself,

2:28:11.440 --> 2:28:13.120
 what am I doing with my life?

2:28:13.120 --> 2:28:16.600
 This is why you're single, was the voice in my head.

2:28:16.600 --> 2:28:18.160
 This is what are you doing?

2:28:18.160 --> 2:28:19.800
 It's like face down on the carpet.

2:28:21.600 --> 2:28:23.040
 Like exhausted.

2:28:23.040 --> 2:28:24.640
 Like what, what?

2:28:24.640 --> 2:28:25.680
 Because of a tweet?

2:28:25.680 --> 2:28:26.840
 What is this?

2:28:26.840 --> 2:28:28.440
 Did you record it or you just?

2:28:28.440 --> 2:28:29.280
 I did.

2:28:29.280 --> 2:28:30.320
 I did record it for myself.

2:28:30.320 --> 2:28:31.160
 Okay.

2:28:31.160 --> 2:28:32.880
 Now imagine doing this every day

2:28:32.880 --> 2:28:34.880
 and that's what it's like to be a Twitch streamer.

2:28:34.880 --> 2:28:35.720
 Just kidding.

2:28:35.720 --> 2:28:36.540
 Right.

2:28:36.540 --> 2:28:37.380
 I'm doing stupid things.

2:28:37.380 --> 2:28:39.240
 That was really important to me actually

2:28:39.240 --> 2:28:41.120
 to not make it into content.

2:28:42.120 --> 2:28:43.320
 You know, I recorded everything.

2:28:43.320 --> 2:28:44.960
 So maybe one day I could publish it.

2:28:44.960 --> 2:28:48.360
 I recorded it mostly because it's really hard to count.

2:28:48.360 --> 2:28:49.200
 Yeah.

2:28:49.200 --> 2:28:50.440
 When you get exhausted.

2:28:50.440 --> 2:28:51.280
 Yeah.

2:28:51.280 --> 2:28:54.640
 Like I just, so you actually enter the Zen place

2:28:54.640 --> 2:28:58.120
 where with pushups, where it's just like,

2:28:58.120 --> 2:28:59.720
 it's almost like breathing.

2:28:59.720 --> 2:29:02.600
 You get into a rhythm and you can do quite a lot.

2:29:02.600 --> 2:29:04.120
 But I wanted to make sure like,

2:29:04.120 --> 2:29:07.920
 if I actually get this done, I want there to be evidence

2:29:07.920 --> 2:29:10.520
 that I got it done for myself so I can count it.

2:29:10.520 --> 2:29:12.240
 I had this idea that I would use machine learning

2:29:12.240 --> 2:29:15.120
 to like automatically process the video to count it.

2:29:15.120 --> 2:29:17.560
 But then like, after like 10 days,

2:29:17.560 --> 2:29:19.060
 I didn't even give a shit what anyone thought.

2:29:19.060 --> 2:29:21.240
 It was about me versus me.

2:29:21.240 --> 2:29:22.080
 I didn't even care.

2:29:22.080 --> 2:29:23.360
 Lex versus Lex.

2:29:23.360 --> 2:29:24.200
 Yeah.

2:29:24.200 --> 2:29:26.000
 And then, yeah.

2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:27.560
 And David was extremely supportive.

2:29:27.560 --> 2:29:28.560
 But that's when I realized like,

2:29:28.560 --> 2:29:31.200
 I really want to go head to head with him.

2:29:31.200 --> 2:29:34.720
 So yeah, those kinds of people are beautiful.

2:29:34.720 --> 2:29:36.020
 They really challenge you to your limits.

2:29:36.020 --> 2:29:37.120
 Whatever that is.

2:29:37.120 --> 2:29:40.080
 It's like, the thing is physical exercise

2:29:40.080 --> 2:29:42.800
 is such an easy way to push yourself to your limit.

2:29:42.800 --> 2:29:44.600
 There's in all other walks of life,

2:29:44.600 --> 2:29:46.400
 it's trickier to configure.

2:29:46.400 --> 2:29:48.760
 Like how do you push yourself to your limits in chess?

2:29:48.760 --> 2:29:50.440
 It's hard to figure out.

2:29:50.440 --> 2:29:51.280
 But like in physical.

2:29:51.280 --> 2:29:53.180
 Do you think it's ever dangerous?

2:29:53.180 --> 2:29:54.020
 Yeah.

2:29:54.020 --> 2:29:56.120
 And that's why it's beautiful.

2:29:56.120 --> 2:29:56.940
 The danger.

2:29:56.940 --> 2:29:57.780
 She likes the pain.

2:29:57.780 --> 2:30:00.040
 I don't like that your eyes lit up as I said.

2:30:00.040 --> 2:30:01.240
 Yeah.

2:30:01.240 --> 2:30:04.800
 Like if you don't know how you're gonna get out of it,

2:30:04.800 --> 2:30:07.240
 you're gonna have to figure out something profound

2:30:08.240 --> 2:30:09.200
 about yourself.

2:30:10.480 --> 2:30:13.060
 And I mean, one of the reasons I went to Ukraine

2:30:13.060 --> 2:30:18.060
 is I really wanted to experience the hardship

2:30:19.280 --> 2:30:23.960
 and the intensity of war that people are experiencing

2:30:23.960 --> 2:30:25.960
 so I can understand myself better,

2:30:25.960 --> 2:30:27.440
 I can understand them better.

2:30:27.440 --> 2:30:30.720
 So the words that are leaving my mouth are grounded

2:30:30.720 --> 2:30:32.400
 in a better understanding of who they are.

2:30:32.400 --> 2:30:36.080
 And I mean, the running a lot with David Gong

2:30:36.080 --> 2:30:39.360
 is it's a much simpler thing to do.

2:30:40.200 --> 2:30:42.400
 Simpler way to understand something about yourself,

2:30:42.400 --> 2:30:44.440
 about like the limits of human nature.

2:30:44.440 --> 2:30:47.760
 I think most growth happens with voluntary suffering

2:30:47.760 --> 2:30:50.240
 or struggle, involuntary stuff.

2:30:50.240 --> 2:30:52.680
 That's where the dark trauma is created.

2:30:52.680 --> 2:30:55.840
 But I don't know, maybe it is.

2:30:55.840 --> 2:30:57.520
 Maybe I'm just attracted to torture.

2:30:57.520 --> 2:30:59.520
 And what is it that your mind does

2:30:59.520 --> 2:31:02.120
 when you're going through this involuntary suffering?

2:31:03.240 --> 2:31:04.080
 I think,

2:31:14.760 --> 2:31:15.880
 there's like stages.

2:31:15.880 --> 2:31:17.760
 First, all the excuses start coming.

2:31:17.760 --> 2:31:20.360
 Like why are you doing this?

2:31:20.360 --> 2:31:25.320
 And then you start to wonder like what kind of person

2:31:25.320 --> 2:31:26.920
 do you want to be?

2:31:26.920 --> 2:31:28.400
 So all the dreams you had,

2:31:28.400 --> 2:31:30.440
 all the promises you made to yourself and to others,

2:31:30.440 --> 2:31:34.520
 all the ambitions you had that haven't come yet realized,

2:31:34.520 --> 2:31:39.080
 somehow that all becomes really intensely like visceral

2:31:39.080 --> 2:31:41.520
 as the struggle is happening.

2:31:41.520 --> 2:31:46.520
 And then when all of that is allowed to pass from your mind,

2:31:47.680 --> 2:31:49.280
 you have this clear appreciation

2:31:49.280 --> 2:31:50.800
 of what you really love in life,

2:31:50.800 --> 2:31:53.040
 which is just like just living.

2:31:53.040 --> 2:31:57.320
 Just the moment, the step at a time.

2:31:57.320 --> 2:32:00.040
 I think what meditation does and it's most effective,

2:32:00.040 --> 2:32:02.480
 it's just that pain is a catalyst

2:32:02.480 --> 2:32:05.040
 for the meditative process, I think.

2:32:05.040 --> 2:32:07.200
 For me, for me.

2:32:07.200 --> 2:32:08.040
 I don't know.

2:32:09.040 --> 2:32:10.680
 Magnus said there's no meaning to life.

2:32:10.680 --> 2:32:14.360
 Do you guys agree or no?

2:32:14.360 --> 2:32:15.480
 Why are we here?

2:32:17.560 --> 2:32:20.520
 I do not know why we're here,

2:32:20.520 --> 2:32:25.520
 but I do know that having some kind of meaning

2:32:26.600 --> 2:32:28.520
 that I give my own life

2:32:28.520 --> 2:32:32.000
 makes it a lot more motivating every day.

2:32:32.000 --> 2:32:34.960
 So I just try to focus on finding meaning within my own life

2:32:34.960 --> 2:32:37.400
 even if I know it's just self imposed.

2:32:38.680 --> 2:32:40.720
 And then chess is a part of that?

2:32:41.960 --> 2:32:44.880
 Chess is a part of it.

2:32:44.880 --> 2:32:47.800
 Maybe it was more so when I was younger

2:32:47.800 --> 2:32:50.960
 because it was easier to just feel like I wanna improve

2:32:50.960 --> 2:32:54.200
 as a person and to use chess

2:32:54.200 --> 2:32:57.240
 to kind of measure some kind of self improvement.

2:32:57.240 --> 2:33:00.480
 And now it's more different than that.

2:33:00.480 --> 2:33:02.840
 And I think I need to once again find

2:33:02.840 --> 2:33:06.960
 what that northern star is.

2:33:06.960 --> 2:33:09.760
 Basically, I need to have a why for why I'm doing things.

2:33:09.760 --> 2:33:12.240
 And then I feel like I could do very hard things.

2:33:12.240 --> 2:33:17.240
 What role does love play in the human condition?

2:33:18.760 --> 2:33:20.280
 Alex and Andrea.

2:33:20.280 --> 2:33:23.120
 I'll let Andrea start this one since I took the last.

2:33:23.120 --> 2:33:23.960
 Sure.

2:33:23.960 --> 2:33:26.800
 And yeah, just to add my answer for the last one.

2:33:26.800 --> 2:33:30.720
 I also kind of think, well, life is meaningless,

2:33:30.720 --> 2:33:32.800
 but I like the stoic idea where that's something

2:33:32.800 --> 2:33:35.240
 that you live to revolt against.

2:33:35.240 --> 2:33:37.440
 But for the second question.

2:33:37.440 --> 2:33:41.640
 The revolt against the fundamental meaninglessness of life.

2:33:41.640 --> 2:33:43.240
 I like it. Exactly.

2:33:43.240 --> 2:33:44.240
 Yeah.

2:33:44.240 --> 2:33:45.760
 It was what does love play?

2:33:45.760 --> 2:33:47.080
 What role does love play?

2:33:47.080 --> 2:33:48.560
 Yeah, in the human condition.

2:33:49.840 --> 2:33:51.200
 The way I see it,

2:33:54.000 --> 2:33:57.360
 love is a reason you want to share experiences

2:33:57.360 --> 2:33:59.160
 with other people.

2:33:59.160 --> 2:34:00.000
 That's how I see it.

2:34:00.000 --> 2:34:01.280
 Like the people you really love,

2:34:01.280 --> 2:34:04.120
 you wanna share the things you're going through with them.

2:34:05.440 --> 2:34:06.480
 The good and the bad.

2:34:06.480 --> 2:34:08.000
 Yeah, exactly.

2:34:08.000 --> 2:34:12.040
 That's my simple take on love.

2:34:12.040 --> 2:34:16.760
 My take on it is that part of what it is to be human

2:34:16.760 --> 2:34:20.560
 is to be somebody who feels things emotionally

2:34:20.560 --> 2:34:25.200
 and love is one of the most intense feelings you can have.

2:34:26.360 --> 2:34:28.440
 Obviously there's the opposite of that

2:34:28.440 --> 2:34:30.000
 and there's things like hate,

2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:33.160
 but I think the love you feel for people like your parents

2:34:33.160 --> 2:34:35.720
 and your friends and romantic love in that moment

2:34:35.720 --> 2:34:40.080
 is much more intense than in other situations.

2:34:41.360 --> 2:34:44.480
 And I think it's also just very unique to humans

2:34:44.480 --> 2:34:46.920
 and that's what I appreciate about it.

2:34:46.920 --> 2:34:49.400
 Maybe that's the meaning of life.

2:34:49.400 --> 2:34:52.240
 Maybe that's what the Stoics are searching for.

2:34:52.240 --> 2:34:54.600
 Andrea, Alex, thank you so much for this

2:34:54.600 --> 2:34:56.680
 and thank you for an amazing conversation.

2:34:56.680 --> 2:34:58.680

2:35:01.120 --> 2:35:02.920
 and love out there in the world.

2:35:02.920 --> 2:35:04.520
 Thank you for having us, Lex.

2:35:04.520 --> 2:35:05.760

2:35:22.680 --> 2:35:24.640
 Chess is life.

2:35:24.640 --> 2:35:36.960
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
