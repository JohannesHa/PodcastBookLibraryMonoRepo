00:00.000 --> 00:02.520
 The following is a conversation with Matt Walker,

00:02.520 --> 00:04.840
 sleep scientist, professor of neuroscience

00:04.840 --> 00:08.680
 and psychology at Berkeley, author of Why We Sleep,

00:08.680 --> 00:13.680
 and the host of a new podcast called The Matt Walker Podcast.

00:14.240 --> 00:17.140
 It's 10 minute episodes a couple of times a month,

00:17.140 --> 00:20.760
 covering sleep and other health and science topics.

00:20.760 --> 00:22.560
 I love it and recommend it highly.

00:22.560 --> 00:24.400
 It's up there with the greats,

00:24.400 --> 00:28.080
 like the Huberman Lab Podcast with Andrew Huberman,

00:28.080 --> 00:30.600
 and I think David Sinclair is putting out

00:30.600 --> 00:32.320
 an audio series soon too.

00:32.320 --> 00:33.760
 I can't wait to listen to it.

00:33.760 --> 00:36.800
 I'm really excited by the future of science

00:36.800 --> 00:38.680
 in the podcasting world.

00:38.680 --> 00:41.680

00:47.160 --> 00:49.840
 Their links are in the description.

00:49.840 --> 00:52.240
 As a side note, let me say that to me,

00:52.240 --> 00:55.120
 a healthy life is one in which you fall in love

00:55.120 --> 00:58.640
 with the world around you, with ideas, with people,

00:58.640 --> 01:02.080
 with small goals and big goals, no matter how difficult,

01:02.080 --> 01:05.880
 with dreams you hold onto and chase for years.

01:05.880 --> 01:07.940
 Life should be lived fully.

01:07.940 --> 01:10.000
 That, to me, is the priority.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.080
 That, to me, is a healthy life.

01:12.080 --> 01:15.520
 Second to that is the understanding and the utilization

01:15.520 --> 01:18.600
 of the best available science on diet, exercise,

01:18.600 --> 01:22.740
 supplements, sleep, and other lifestyle choices.

01:22.740 --> 01:26.520
 To me, science in the realm of health is a guide

01:26.520 --> 01:28.960
 for what we should try, not the absolute truth

01:28.960 --> 01:30.960
 of how to live life.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.040
 The goal is to learn to listen to your body

01:33.040 --> 01:35.800
 and figure out what works best for you.

01:35.800 --> 01:39.480
 All that said, a good night's sleep can be a great tool

01:39.480 --> 01:41.720
 in making life awesome and productive,

01:41.720 --> 01:46.720
 and Matt is a great advocate of the how and the why of sleep.

01:46.960 --> 01:49.760
 We agree on some things and disagree on others,

01:49.760 --> 01:52.440
 but he's a great human being, a great scientist,

01:52.440 --> 01:55.480
 and, as of recently, a friend with whom I enjoy

01:55.480 --> 01:58.680
 having these wide ranging conversations.

01:58.680 --> 02:00.840
 This is the Lux Friedman podcast,

02:00.840 --> 02:04.160
 and here is my conversation with Matt Walker.

02:05.080 --> 02:06.480
 You should try these shades on.

02:06.480 --> 02:07.880
 Let's see what you look like.

02:11.160 --> 02:14.720
 So they are now your shades, and that's not the question.

02:14.720 --> 02:17.680
 It's the same thing as Putin took the Super Bowl ring,

02:17.680 --> 02:18.860
 and it's now his ring.

02:18.860 --> 02:22.620
 Yeah, one wonders if he was offered it,

02:22.620 --> 02:24.200
 but they are yours.

02:26.380 --> 02:31.380
 When did you first fall in love with the dream

02:31.500 --> 02:32.820
 of understanding sleep?

02:32.820 --> 02:36.320
 Like, where did the fascination with sleep begin?

02:38.420 --> 02:41.060
 So back in the United Kingdom,

02:41.060 --> 02:44.060
 you can sort of start doing medicine at age 18,

02:44.060 --> 02:46.020
 and it's a five year program,

02:46.020 --> 02:50.620
 and I was at the Queen's Medical Center in the UK,

02:50.620 --> 02:52.740
 and I remember just being fascinated

02:52.740 --> 02:57.180
 by states of consciousness, and particularly anesthesia.

02:57.180 --> 03:00.220
 I was thinking, isn't that, within seconds,

03:00.220 --> 03:03.300
 I can take a perfectly conscious human being,

03:03.300 --> 03:07.540
 and I can remove all existence of the mentality

03:07.540 --> 03:09.820
 and their awareness within seconds,

03:10.700 --> 03:12.500
 and that stunned me.

03:12.500 --> 03:15.500
 So I started to get really interested in conscious states.

03:15.500 --> 03:18.020
 I even started to read a lot about hypnosis,

03:19.700 --> 03:22.280
 and all of these things, hypnosis,

03:22.280 --> 03:24.340
 even sleep and dreams at the time,

03:24.340 --> 03:25.940
 they were very esoteric.

03:25.940 --> 03:29.720
 It was sort of charlatan science at that stage,

03:29.720 --> 03:33.660
 and I think almost all of my colleagues and I

03:33.660 --> 03:36.660
 are accidental sleep researchers.

03:36.660 --> 03:38.980
 No one, as I recall, in the classroom

03:38.980 --> 03:40.340
 when you're sort of five years old,

03:40.340 --> 03:41.340
 and the teacher says,

03:41.340 --> 03:44.020
 what would you like to be when you grow up?

03:44.020 --> 03:45.340
 No one's putting their hand up and saying,

03:45.340 --> 03:48.540
 I would love to be a sleep researcher.

03:48.540 --> 03:51.500
 And so when I was doing my PhD,

03:51.500 --> 03:55.060
 I was trying to identify different forms of dementia

03:55.060 --> 03:57.500
 very early on in the course,

03:57.500 --> 04:00.660
 and I was using electrical brainwave recordings to do that,

04:00.660 --> 04:02.620
 and I was failing miserably.

04:02.620 --> 04:07.260
 It was a disaster, just no result after no result.

04:07.260 --> 04:09.220
 And I used to go home to the doctor's residence

04:09.220 --> 04:11.260
 with this sort of little igloo of journals

04:11.260 --> 04:15.060
 that at the weekend I would sort of sit in and read,

04:15.060 --> 04:16.940
 and which I'm now thinking,

04:16.940 --> 04:18.140
 do I really want to admit this?

04:18.140 --> 04:19.780
 Because it sounds like I had no social life,

04:19.780 --> 04:21.900
 which I didn't, I was a social leper.

04:21.900 --> 04:26.260
 But, and I started to realize that some parts of the brain

04:26.260 --> 04:29.020
 were sleep related areas,

04:29.020 --> 04:31.540
 and some dementias were eating away

04:31.540 --> 04:33.660
 those sleep related areas.

04:33.660 --> 04:35.780
 Other dementias would leave them untouched.

04:35.780 --> 04:38.060
 And I thought, well, I'm doing this all wrong.

04:38.060 --> 04:41.260
 I'm measuring my patients while they're awake.

04:41.260 --> 04:43.980
 Instead, I should be measuring them while they're asleep.

04:43.980 --> 04:47.500
 Started doing that, got some amazing results.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.700
 And then I wanted to ask the question,

04:49.700 --> 04:54.100
 is that sleep disruption that my patients are experiencing

04:54.100 --> 04:55.700
 as they go into dementia,

04:55.700 --> 04:57.900
 maybe it's not a symptom of the dementia.

04:57.900 --> 05:01.940
 I wonder if it's a cause of the dementia.

05:01.940 --> 05:06.060
 And at that point, which was, cough, cough, 20 years ago,

05:07.820 --> 05:11.060
 no one could answer a very simple fundamental question.

05:11.060 --> 05:12.020
 Why do we sleep?

05:12.020 --> 05:17.020
 And I at the time didn't realize

05:17.020 --> 05:19.820
 that some of the most brilliant minds in scientific history

05:19.820 --> 05:22.580
 had tried to answer that question and failed.

05:22.580 --> 05:24.540
 And at that point, I just thought, well,

05:24.540 --> 05:27.660
 I'm going to go and do a couple of years of sleep research

05:27.660 --> 05:30.220
 and I'll figure out why we sleep.

05:30.220 --> 05:31.700
 And then I'll come back to my patients

05:31.700 --> 05:33.700
 in this question of dementia.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.420
 And as I said, that was 20 years ago.

05:35.420 --> 05:38.620
 And what I realized is that hard questions

05:38.620 --> 05:41.460
 care very little about who asks them.

05:41.460 --> 05:44.060
 They will meter out their lessons of difficulty

05:44.060 --> 05:45.180
 all the same.

05:45.180 --> 05:48.860
 And I was schooled in the difficulty of the question,

05:48.860 --> 05:50.540
 why do we sleep?

05:50.540 --> 05:53.020
 But in truth, 20 years later,

05:53.020 --> 05:55.300
 we've had to upend the question

05:55.300 --> 05:57.260
 rather than saying, why do we sleep?

05:57.260 --> 05:59.980
 And by the way, the answer then was

05:59.980 --> 06:02.140
 that we sleep to cure sleepiness,

06:03.580 --> 06:07.060
 which is like saying, we eat to cure hunger.

06:07.060 --> 06:09.380
 That tells you nothing about the physiological benefits

06:09.380 --> 06:11.580
 of food, same with sleep.

06:11.580 --> 06:14.300
 Now we've actually have to ask the question,

06:14.300 --> 06:17.100
 is there any physiological system in the body

06:17.100 --> 06:19.340
 or any major operation of the mind

06:19.340 --> 06:22.380
 that isn't wonderfully enhanced when we get sleep

06:22.380 --> 06:25.580
 or demonstrably impaired when we don't get enough?

06:25.580 --> 06:28.900
 And so far, for the most part, the answer seems to be no.

06:29.940 --> 06:32.940
 So far, the answer seems to be no.

06:32.940 --> 06:37.940
 So why does the body and the mind crave sleep?

06:37.940 --> 06:39.700
 Crave sleep then?

06:39.700 --> 06:41.140
 Why do we sleep?

06:41.140 --> 06:45.780
 How can we begin to answer that question then?

06:45.780 --> 06:48.220
 So I think one of the ways that I think about this

06:48.220 --> 06:53.060
 or one of the answers that came to me is the following.

06:53.060 --> 06:55.460
 The reason that we implode so quickly

06:55.460 --> 06:58.660
 and so thoroughly with insufficient sleep

06:58.660 --> 07:01.780
 is because human beings seem to be one of the few species

07:01.780 --> 07:04.020
 that will deliberately deprive themselves of sleep

07:04.020 --> 07:06.700
 for no apparent good reason, biological.

07:06.700 --> 07:11.380
 And what that led me then to was the following.

07:11.380 --> 07:13.580
 Mother nature as a consequence.

07:13.580 --> 07:17.780
 So no other species does what we do in that context.

07:17.780 --> 07:20.940
 There are a few species that do undergo sleep deprivation,

07:20.940 --> 07:24.500
 but for very obvious, clear biological reasons.

07:24.500 --> 07:27.620
 One is when they're in a condition of severe starvation.

07:27.620 --> 07:30.900
 The second is when they're caring for their newborn.

07:30.900 --> 07:34.180
 So for example, killer whales will often deprive themselves.

07:34.180 --> 07:37.780
 The female will go away from the pod, give birth,

07:37.780 --> 07:39.860
 and then bring the calf back.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.260
 And during that time,

07:41.260 --> 07:43.980
 the mother will undergo sleep deprivation.

07:43.980 --> 07:46.580
 And then the third one is during migration

07:46.580 --> 07:51.380
 when birds are flying trans oceanographic 2,000, 3,000 miles.

07:51.380 --> 07:52.340
 But for the most part,

07:52.340 --> 07:54.980
 it's never seen in the animal kingdom,

07:54.980 --> 07:57.140
 which brings me back to the point,

07:57.140 --> 08:00.900
 therefore mother nature in the course of evolution

08:00.900 --> 08:03.540
 has never had to face the challenge of this thing

08:03.540 --> 08:05.940
 called sleep deprivation.

08:05.940 --> 08:11.300
 And therefore she has never created a safety net in place

08:11.300 --> 08:15.300
 to circumnavigate this common influence.

08:15.300 --> 08:18.420
 And there is a good example where we have,

08:18.420 --> 08:22.300
 which is called the adipose cell, the fat cell.

08:22.300 --> 08:24.420
 Because during our evolutionary past,

08:24.420 --> 08:26.860
 we had famine and we had feast.

08:26.860 --> 08:29.140
 And mother nature came up with a very clever recipe,

08:29.140 --> 08:34.140
 which is how can I store caloric credit

08:34.460 --> 08:37.220
 so that I can spend it when I go into debt?

08:37.220 --> 08:39.620
 And the fat cell was born, brilliant idea.

08:39.620 --> 08:42.020
 Where is the fat cell for sleep?

08:42.020 --> 08:44.380
 Where is that sort of banking chip for sleep?

08:44.380 --> 08:46.580
 And unfortunately we don't seem to have one

08:46.580 --> 08:49.380
 because she's never had to face that challenge.

08:49.380 --> 08:52.660
 So even if there's not some kind of physics,

08:52.660 --> 08:55.300
 fundamental need for sleep

08:55.300 --> 08:58.820
 that physiologically or psychologically,

08:58.820 --> 09:03.820
 the fact is most organisms are built such that they need it.

09:03.820 --> 09:08.060
 And then mother nature never built an extra mechanism

09:08.060 --> 09:09.580
 for sleep deprivation.

09:09.580 --> 09:12.180
 So it's interesting that why we sleep

09:12.180 --> 09:13.620
 might not have a good answer,

09:14.940 --> 09:19.460
 but we need to sleep to be healthy is nevertheless true.

09:19.460 --> 09:21.700
 Yeah, and we have many answers right now.

09:21.700 --> 09:23.940
 In some ways the question of why we sleep

09:23.940 --> 09:25.940
 was the wrong question too.

09:25.940 --> 09:30.220
 It's what are the plory potent many reasons we sleep?

09:30.220 --> 09:32.500
 We don't just sleep for one reason

09:32.500 --> 09:35.740
 because from an evolutionary perspective,

09:35.740 --> 09:39.940
 it is the most idiotic thing that you could imagine.

09:39.940 --> 09:42.980
 When you're sleeping, you're not finding a mate,

09:42.980 --> 09:43.900
 you're not reproducing,

09:43.900 --> 09:45.500
 you're not caring for your young,

09:45.500 --> 09:47.420
 you're not foraging for food,

09:47.420 --> 09:50.580
 and worse still, you're vulnerable to predation.

09:50.580 --> 09:52.700
 So on any one of those grounds,

09:52.700 --> 09:54.660
 especially as a collective,

09:54.660 --> 09:57.860
 sleep should have been strongly selected against

09:57.860 --> 09:59.780
 in the course of evolution.

09:59.780 --> 10:03.900
 But in every species that we've studied carefully to date,

10:03.900 --> 10:05.660
 sleep is present.

10:05.660 --> 10:07.060
 Yeah, so it is important.

10:07.060 --> 10:09.020
 So like you're right.

10:09.020 --> 10:10.380
 I think I've heard arguments

10:10.380 --> 10:12.260
 from an evolutionary biology perspective

10:12.260 --> 10:15.780
 that sleep is actually advantageous,

10:15.780 --> 10:18.580
 maybe like some kind of predator prey relationships.

10:18.580 --> 10:19.860
 But you're saying,

10:19.860 --> 10:22.500
 and it actually makes way more sense what you're saying

10:22.500 --> 10:25.180
 is it should have been selected against.

10:25.180 --> 10:27.300
 Like why close your eyes?

10:27.300 --> 10:28.140
 Yeah, why?

10:28.140 --> 10:31.900
 Because there was an energy conservation hypothesis

10:31.900 --> 10:32.740
 for a while,

10:32.740 --> 10:34.140
 which is that we need to essentially go

10:34.140 --> 10:37.380
 into low battery mode, power down,

10:37.380 --> 10:38.860
 because it's unsustainable.

10:38.860 --> 10:41.900
 But in fact, that actually has been blasted out the water

10:41.900 --> 10:45.660
 because sleep is an incredibly active process.

10:45.660 --> 10:48.900
 In fact, the difference between you just lying on the couch

10:48.900 --> 10:51.820
 but remaining conscious versus you lying on the couch

10:51.820 --> 10:53.060
 and falling asleep,

10:53.060 --> 10:56.660
 it's only a savings of about 140, 150 calories.

10:56.660 --> 10:58.540
 In other words, you just go out

10:58.540 --> 11:00.940
 and club another baby seal or whatever it was,

11:00.940 --> 11:02.380
 and you wouldn't worry.

11:02.380 --> 11:05.060
 So it has to be much more to it than energy conservation,

11:05.060 --> 11:09.780
 much more to it than sharing ecosystem space and time,

11:09.780 --> 11:13.620
 much more to it than simply predator prey relationships.

11:13.620 --> 11:15.220
 If sleep really did,

11:15.220 --> 11:17.260
 and looking back,

11:17.260 --> 11:20.740
 even very old evolutionary organisms like earthworms,

11:20.740 --> 11:22.100
 millions of years old,

11:22.100 --> 11:24.740
 they have periods where they're active

11:24.740 --> 11:26.500
 and periods where they're passively asleep.

11:26.500 --> 11:27.820
 It's called lethargicus.

11:28.700 --> 11:32.180
 And so what that in some ways suggested to me

11:32.180 --> 11:36.660
 was sleep evolved with life itself on this planet,

11:36.660 --> 11:39.660
 and then it has fought its way through heroically

11:39.660 --> 11:42.620
 every step along the evolutionary pathway,

11:42.620 --> 11:46.540
 which then leads to the sort of famous sleep statement

11:46.540 --> 11:48.860
 from a researcher that if sleep doesn't serve

11:48.860 --> 11:52.180
 an absolutely vital function or functions,

11:52.180 --> 11:53.220
 then it's the biggest mistake

11:53.220 --> 11:55.700
 the evolutionary process has ever made.

11:55.700 --> 11:57.300
 And we've now realized Mother Nature

11:57.300 --> 12:00.100
 didn't make a spectacular blender with sleep.

12:00.100 --> 12:03.180
 You've mentioned the idea of conscious states.

12:03.180 --> 12:04.940
 Do you think of sleep

12:04.940 --> 12:08.940
 as a fundamentally different conscious state than awakeness?

12:11.100 --> 12:13.340
 And how many conscious states are there

12:13.340 --> 12:14.660
 so when you're into it,

12:14.660 --> 12:17.380
 you're understanding of what the mind can do,

12:17.380 --> 12:20.500
 do you think awake state, sleep state,

12:20.500 --> 12:22.700
 or is there some kind of continuum?

12:22.700 --> 12:26.220
 There's a complicated state transition diagram.

12:26.220 --> 12:28.580
 Like how do you think about this whole space?

12:28.580 --> 12:32.060
 I think about it as a state space diagram.

12:32.060 --> 12:34.100
 And I think it's probably more of a continuum

12:34.100 --> 12:37.700
 than we have believed it to be or suggested it to be.

12:37.700 --> 12:41.420
 So we used to think absent of anesthesia

12:41.420 --> 12:44.540
 that there were already three main states of consciousness.

12:44.540 --> 12:48.860
 There was being awake, being in non rapid eye movement sleep

12:48.860 --> 12:50.340
 or non dream sleep,

12:50.340 --> 12:53.300
 and then being in rapid eye movement sleep or dream sleep.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.220
 And those were the three states

12:55.220 --> 13:00.340
 within which your brain could percolate and be conscious.

13:00.340 --> 13:05.100
 Conscious during non REM sleep is maybe a stretch to say,

13:05.100 --> 13:08.500
 but I still believe there is plenty of consciousness there.

13:08.500 --> 13:11.420
 I don't believe that though anymore.

13:11.420 --> 13:14.940
 And the reason is because we can have daydreams

13:15.900 --> 13:20.140
 and we are in a very different wakeful state

13:20.140 --> 13:23.420
 in those daydreams than we are when we are as we are now

13:23.420 --> 13:27.180
 together present and extra septively focused

13:27.180 --> 13:29.940
 rather than intra septively focused.

13:30.940 --> 13:35.820
 And then we also know that as you are sort of progressing

13:35.820 --> 13:38.820
 into those different stages of sleep during non REM sleep,

13:38.820 --> 13:40.340
 you can also still dream,

13:40.340 --> 13:42.340
 depends on your definition of dreaming,

13:42.340 --> 13:44.860
 but we seem to have some degree of dreaming

13:44.860 --> 13:47.540
 in almost all stages of sleep.

13:48.540 --> 13:51.940
 We've also then found that when you are sleep deprived,

13:51.940 --> 13:56.220
 there are even individual brain cells will fall asleep.

13:56.220 --> 13:59.060
 Despite the animal being, you know,

13:59.060 --> 14:02.420
 behaviorally from best we can tell awake,

14:02.420 --> 14:05.060
 individual brain cells and clusters of brain cells

14:05.060 --> 14:07.740
 will go into a sleep like state.

14:07.740 --> 14:09.460
 And humans do this too.

14:09.460 --> 14:10.940
 When we are sleep deprived,

14:10.940 --> 14:13.580
 we have what are called microsleeps

14:13.580 --> 14:17.180
 where the eyelid will partially close

14:17.180 --> 14:20.540
 and the brain essentially falls lapses

14:20.540 --> 14:23.060
 into a state of sleep,

14:23.060 --> 14:25.300
 but behaviorally you seem to be awake.

14:25.300 --> 14:28.820
 And the danger here is road traffic accidents.

14:28.820 --> 14:30.820
 So these are the,

14:30.820 --> 14:34.780
 what we call these sort of microsleep events at the wheel.

14:34.780 --> 14:38.100
 Now, if you're traveling at 65 miles an hour

14:38.100 --> 14:40.340
 in a two ton vehicle,

14:40.340 --> 14:42.740
 you know, it takes probably around one second

14:42.740 --> 14:44.340
 to drift from one lane to the next

14:44.340 --> 14:48.140
 and it takes two seconds to go completely off the road.

14:48.140 --> 14:50.620
 So if you have one of these microsleeps at the wheel,

14:50.620 --> 14:52.540
 you know, it could be the last microsleep

14:52.540 --> 14:53.500
 that you ever have.

14:54.580 --> 14:57.460
 But I don't now see it as a set of,

14:57.460 --> 15:00.220
 you know, very binary distinct,

15:00.220 --> 15:02.260
 you know, step function state.

15:02.260 --> 15:04.460
 It's not a one or a zero.

15:04.460 --> 15:07.020
 I see it more of a, as a continuum.

15:07.020 --> 15:12.020
 So I've for five, six years at MIT

15:13.460 --> 15:17.740
 really focused on this human side of driving question.

15:17.740 --> 15:22.740
 And one of the big concerns is the microsleeps,

15:23.180 --> 15:25.340
 drowsiness, these kinds of ideas.

15:25.340 --> 15:27.100
 And one of the open questions was,

15:27.100 --> 15:29.940
 is it possible through computer vision to detect

15:29.940 --> 15:32.340
 or any kind of sensors?

15:32.340 --> 15:33.860
 The nice thing about computer vision

15:33.860 --> 15:36.860
 is you don't have to have direct contact to the person.

15:36.860 --> 15:41.740
 Is it possible to detect increases in drowsiness?

15:41.740 --> 15:44.140
 Is it possible to detect these kinds of microsleeps

15:44.140 --> 15:46.100
 or actually just sleep in general?

15:47.260 --> 15:49.260
 Among other things, like distraction,

15:49.260 --> 15:52.060
 these are all words that have so many meanings

15:52.060 --> 15:55.900
 and so many debates, like attention is a whole nother one.

15:55.900 --> 15:57.300
 Just because you're looking at something

15:57.300 --> 16:00.180
 doesn't mean you're loading in the information.

16:00.180 --> 16:02.260
 Just because you're looking away

16:02.260 --> 16:03.780
 doesn't mean your peripheral vision

16:03.780 --> 16:05.780
 can't pick up the important information.

16:05.780 --> 16:08.860
 There's so many complicated vision science things there.

16:08.860 --> 16:11.940
 So I wonder if you could say something to,

16:13.140 --> 16:15.260
 they say the eyes are the windows to the soul.

16:15.260 --> 16:19.140
 Do you think the eyes can reveal

16:19.140 --> 16:24.140
 something about sleepiness through computer vision,

16:25.700 --> 16:27.580
 just looking at the video of the face?

16:27.580 --> 16:30.180
 And Andrew Huberman and I, your friend,

16:30.180 --> 16:31.020
 have talked about this.

16:31.020 --> 16:33.620
 I would love to work on this together.

16:33.620 --> 16:35.620
 It's a fascinating problem.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.180
 But drowsiness is a tricky one.

16:37.180 --> 16:39.340
 So there's, what kind of information?

16:39.340 --> 16:42.700
 There's blinking and there's eye movement.

16:42.700 --> 16:46.020
 And those are the ones that can be picked up

16:46.020 --> 16:46.860
 with computer vision.

16:46.860 --> 16:48.980
 Do you think those are signals that could be used

16:48.980 --> 16:52.660
 to say something about where we are in this continuum?

16:52.660 --> 16:53.540
 Yeah, I do.

16:53.540 --> 16:55.580
 And I think there are a number of other features too.

16:55.580 --> 16:59.460
 I think, you know, aperture of eye.

16:59.460 --> 17:03.100
 So in other words, partial closures, full closures,

17:03.100 --> 17:06.460
 duration of those closures, duration of those partial

17:06.460 --> 17:08.100
 closures of the eyelid.

17:09.380 --> 17:13.380
 I think there may be some information in the pupil as well,

17:13.380 --> 17:16.420
 because as we're transitioning between those states,

17:16.420 --> 17:17.900
 there are changes in what's called

17:17.900 --> 17:19.300
 the automatic nervous system,

17:19.300 --> 17:22.780
 or technically it's called the autonomic nervous system,

17:22.780 --> 17:27.060
 part of which will control your pupillary size.

17:27.060 --> 17:29.820
 So I actually think that there is probably

17:29.820 --> 17:32.300
 a wealth of information.

17:32.300 --> 17:37.020
 When you combine that probably with aspects of steering,

17:37.020 --> 17:38.940
 angle steering maneuver.

17:39.860 --> 17:44.460
 And if you can sense the pressure on the pedals as well,

17:44.460 --> 17:48.020
 my guess is that there is some combinatorial feature

17:48.020 --> 17:52.020
 that creates a phenotype of,

17:52.020 --> 17:54.260
 you are starting to fall asleep.

17:54.260 --> 17:57.980
 And as the autonomous controls develop,

17:57.980 --> 18:00.460
 that it's time for them to kick in.

18:00.460 --> 18:03.460
 Some manufacturers, auto manufacturers sort of have

18:03.460 --> 18:07.900
 something beta version, maybe an alpha version of this

18:07.900 --> 18:09.420
 already starting to come online,

18:09.420 --> 18:11.900
 where they have a little camera in the wheel

18:11.900 --> 18:14.540
 that I think tries to look at some features.

18:14.540 --> 18:17.700
 Almost everybody doing this and it's very alpha.

18:19.940 --> 18:23.180
 So, you know, the thing that you currently have,

18:23.180 --> 18:24.420
 some people have that in their car,

18:24.420 --> 18:26.460
 there's a coffee cup or something that comes up

18:26.460 --> 18:27.980
 that you might be sleepy.

18:27.980 --> 18:31.580
 The primary signal that they're comfortable using

18:31.580 --> 18:33.380
 is the steering wheel reversals.

18:33.380 --> 18:37.460
 So basically using your interaction with the steering wheel

18:37.460 --> 18:39.700
 and how much you're interacting with it

18:39.700 --> 18:40.940
 as a sign of sleepiness.

18:40.940 --> 18:43.620
 So if you have to constantly correct the car,

18:43.620 --> 18:46.260
 that's a sign of like you starting to drift

18:46.260 --> 18:47.380
 into microsleep.

18:47.380 --> 18:49.540
 I think that's a very, very crude signal.

18:49.540 --> 18:51.180
 It's probably a powerful one.

18:51.180 --> 18:52.740
 There's a whole nother component to this,

18:52.740 --> 18:57.740
 which is it seems like it's so driver and subject dependent.

18:59.220 --> 19:04.220
 How our behavior changes as we get sleepy and drowsy

19:04.220 --> 19:08.140
 seems to be different in complicated, fascinating ways

19:08.140 --> 19:09.780
 where you can't just use one signal.

19:09.780 --> 19:11.100
 It's kind of like what you're saying,

19:11.100 --> 19:13.540
 there has to be a lot of different signals

19:13.540 --> 19:15.380
 that you should then be able to combine.

19:15.380 --> 19:19.780
 The hope is there's the searches for like universal signals

19:19.780 --> 19:23.580
 that are pretty damn good for like 90% of people.

19:23.580 --> 19:24.620
 But I don't think we need

19:24.620 --> 19:27.220
 to take necessarily quite that approach.

19:27.220 --> 19:31.100
 I think what we could do in some clever fashion

19:31.100 --> 19:33.500
 is using the individual.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.620
 So what you and I are perhaps suggesting here

19:35.620 --> 19:38.420
 is that there is an array of features

19:38.420 --> 19:40.860
 that we know provide information

19:40.860 --> 19:42.780
 that is sensitive to whether or not

19:42.780 --> 19:44.580
 you're falling asleep at the wheel.

19:44.580 --> 19:47.940
 Some of those, let's say that there are 10 of them,

19:47.940 --> 19:51.860
 for me, seven of them are the cardinal features.

19:51.860 --> 19:54.580
 For you, however, you know, six of them

19:54.580 --> 19:58.100
 and they're not all the same sort of overlapping

19:58.100 --> 19:59.980
 are those for you.

19:59.980 --> 20:01.900
 I think what we need is algorithms

20:01.900 --> 20:04.500
 that can firstly understand when you are well slept.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.980
 So let's say that people have sleep trackers at night

20:06.980 --> 20:09.260
 and then your car integrates that information

20:09.260 --> 20:12.660
 and it understands when you are well slept.

20:12.660 --> 20:16.700
 And then you've got the data of the individual behavior

20:16.700 --> 20:20.380
 unique to that individual, snowflake like,

20:20.380 --> 20:21.940
 when they are well slept.

20:21.940 --> 20:26.540
 This is the signature of well rested driving.

20:26.540 --> 20:29.260
 Then you can look at deviations from that

20:29.260 --> 20:32.260
 and pattern match it with the sleep history

20:32.260 --> 20:33.700
 of that individual.

20:33.700 --> 20:37.460
 And then I don't need to find the sort of, you know,

20:37.460 --> 20:41.100
 the one size fits all approach for 99% of the people.

20:41.100 --> 20:45.460
 I can create a very bespoke tailor like set of features,

20:45.460 --> 20:49.580
 a Savile Row suit of sleepiness features.

20:49.580 --> 20:50.540
 You know, that would be my,

20:50.540 --> 20:53.540
 if you want to ask me about moon shots and crazy ideas,

20:53.540 --> 20:54.380
 that's where I go.

20:54.380 --> 20:58.180
 But to start with, I think your approach is a great one.

20:58.180 --> 21:02.060
 Let's find something that covers 99% of the people

21:02.060 --> 21:04.700
 because the worrying thing about microsleeps of course,

21:04.700 --> 21:08.300
 unlike, you know, drugs or alcohol, which you know,

21:08.300 --> 21:11.940
 certainly is a terrible thing to be behind the wheel.

21:11.940 --> 21:16.940
 With those often you react too late.

21:17.660 --> 21:20.180
 And that's the reason you get into an accident.

21:20.180 --> 21:22.820
 When you fall asleep behind the wheel,

21:22.820 --> 21:24.260
 you don't react at all.

21:25.140 --> 21:26.220
 You know, at that point,

21:26.220 --> 21:28.580
 there is a two ton missile driving down the street

21:28.580 --> 21:29.940
 and no one's in control.

21:29.940 --> 21:34.420
 That's why those accidents can often be more dangerous.

21:34.420 --> 21:37.340
 Yeah, and the fascinating thing is,

21:37.340 --> 21:39.420
 in the case of semi autonomous vehicles,

21:39.420 --> 21:40.940
 like Tesla autopilot,

21:40.940 --> 21:44.700
 this is where I've had disagreements with Mr. Elon Musk,

21:46.980 --> 21:50.020
 and the human factors community,

21:50.020 --> 21:53.700
 which is this community that one of the big things they study

21:53.700 --> 21:56.780
 is human supervision over automation.

21:56.780 --> 22:00.620
 So you have like pilots, you know, supervising an airplane

22:00.620 --> 22:02.740
 that's mostly flying autonomously.

22:02.740 --> 22:06.700
 The question is, when we're actually doing the driving,

22:07.700 --> 22:09.860
 how do microsleeps or general,

22:09.860 --> 22:12.100
 how does drowsiness progress

22:12.100 --> 22:14.020
 and how does it affect our driving?

22:14.020 --> 22:17.460
 That question becomes more fascinating, more complicated

22:17.460 --> 22:19.540
 when your task is not driving,

22:19.540 --> 22:21.660
 but supervising the driving.

22:21.660 --> 22:24.780
 So your task is to take over when stuff goes wrong.

22:24.780 --> 22:27.140
 And that is complicated,

22:27.140 --> 22:30.260
 but the basic conclusions from many decades

22:30.260 --> 22:34.300
 is that humans are really crappy at supervising

22:34.300 --> 22:39.300
 because they get drowsy and lose vigilance much, much faster.

22:39.300 --> 22:42.020
 The really surprising thing with Tesla autopilot,

22:42.020 --> 22:44.260
 it was surprising to me,

22:44.260 --> 22:46.780
 surprising to the human factors community,

22:46.780 --> 22:49.100
 and in fact, they still argue with me about it,

22:49.100 --> 22:54.100
 is it seems that humans in Teslas with autopilot

22:55.020 --> 22:58.540
 and other similar systems are not becoming less vigilant,

22:58.540 --> 23:01.380
 at least with the studies we've done.

23:01.380 --> 23:05.100
 So there's something about the urgency of driving.

23:05.100 --> 23:06.980
 I can't, I'm not sure why,

23:06.980 --> 23:08.660
 but there's something about the risk,

23:08.660 --> 23:10.580
 I think the fact that you might die

23:11.620 --> 23:14.220
 is still keeping people awake.

23:14.220 --> 23:16.300
 The question is, as Tesla autopilot

23:16.300 --> 23:19.180
 or similar systems get better and better and better,

23:19.180 --> 23:21.460
 how does that affect increasing drowsiness?

23:21.460 --> 23:23.020
 And that's when you need to have,

23:23.020 --> 23:25.180
 that's where the big disagreement was,

23:25.180 --> 23:27.100
 you need to have driver sensing,

23:27.100 --> 23:28.940
 meaning driver facing camera

23:30.060 --> 23:33.460
 that tracks some kind of information about the face

23:33.460 --> 23:35.860
 that can tell you drowsiness.

23:35.860 --> 23:38.780
 So you can tell the car if you're drowsy

23:38.780 --> 23:40.020
 so that the car can be like,

23:40.020 --> 23:43.700
 you should be probably driving or pull to the side.

23:43.700 --> 23:47.220
 Right, or I need to do some of the heavy lifting here.

23:47.220 --> 23:50.500
 Yeah, so there needs to be that dance of interaction

23:50.500 --> 23:53.460
 of a human and machine,

23:53.460 --> 23:56.620
 but currently it's mostly steering wheel based.

23:56.620 --> 23:59.980
 So this idea that your hands should be

23:59.980 --> 24:02.180
 on the steering wheel,

24:02.180 --> 24:05.660
 that's a sign that you're paying attention

24:05.660 --> 24:09.420
 is an outdated and a very crude metric.

24:09.420 --> 24:11.180
 I agree, yeah.

24:11.180 --> 24:13.300
 I think there are far more sophisticated ways

24:13.300 --> 24:16.380
 that we can solve that problem if we invest.

24:17.220 --> 24:20.580
 Can I ask you a big philosophical question

24:20.580 --> 24:22.940
 before we get into fun details?

24:24.660 --> 24:26.540
 On the topic of conscious states,

24:28.340 --> 24:31.180
 how fundamental do you think is consciousness

24:31.180 --> 24:33.300
 to the human mind?

24:33.300 --> 24:36.340
 I ask this from almost like a robotics perspective.

24:36.340 --> 24:38.980
 So in your study of sleep,

24:38.980 --> 24:42.020
 do you think the hard question of consciousness

24:42.020 --> 24:45.340
 that it feels like something to be us,

24:45.340 --> 24:46.820
 is that like a nice little feature,

24:46.820 --> 24:50.180
 like a quirk of our mind,

24:50.180 --> 24:51.940
 or is it somehow fundamental?

24:51.940 --> 24:55.780
 Because sleep feels like we take a step out

24:55.780 --> 24:57.780
 of that consciousness a little bit.

24:57.780 --> 25:00.500
 So from all your study of sleep,

25:00.500 --> 25:04.260
 do you think consciousness is like deeply part of who we are

25:04.260 --> 25:05.780
 or is it just a nice trick?

25:06.900 --> 25:09.580
 I think it's a deeply embedded feature

25:09.580 --> 25:13.300
 that I can imagine has a whole panoply

25:13.300 --> 25:16.060
 of biological benefits.

25:16.060 --> 25:17.660
 But to your point about sleep,

25:17.660 --> 25:20.860
 what is interesting if you do a lot of dream research

25:20.860 --> 25:21.980
 and we've done some,

25:23.340 --> 25:28.100
 it's very, very rare at all, in fact,

25:28.100 --> 25:31.180
 for you to end up becoming someone

25:31.180 --> 25:33.380
 other than who you are in your dreams.

25:33.380 --> 25:35.900
 Now you can have third person perspective dreams

25:35.900 --> 25:38.740
 where you can see yourself in the dream

25:38.740 --> 25:40.540
 as if you're sort of,

25:40.540 --> 25:44.940
 you've risen above your physical being.

25:44.940 --> 25:46.180
 But for the most part,

25:46.180 --> 25:51.180
 it's very rare that we lose our sense of conscious self.

25:51.380 --> 25:53.660
 And maybe I'm sort of doing a sleight of hand

25:53.660 --> 25:55.020
 because it's really what I'm saying,

25:55.020 --> 25:56.580
 it's very rare that we lose our sense

25:56.580 --> 25:58.660
 of who we are in dreams.

25:58.660 --> 25:59.940
 We never do.

25:59.940 --> 26:04.380
 Now that's not to suggest that dreams aren't utterly bizarre.

26:04.380 --> 26:07.780
 And I mean, when you slept last night,

26:07.780 --> 26:12.060
 which I know may have been perhaps a little less than me,

26:12.060 --> 26:14.740
 but when you went into dreaming,

26:14.740 --> 26:18.180
 you became flagrantly psychotic.

26:18.180 --> 26:20.420
 And there are five essentially good reasons.

26:20.420 --> 26:23.460
 Firstly, you started to see things which were not there,

26:23.460 --> 26:25.180
 so you were hallucinating.

26:25.180 --> 26:28.260
 Second, you believe things that couldn't possibly be true,

26:28.260 --> 26:30.140
 so you were delusional.

26:30.140 --> 26:35.140
 Third, you became confused about time and place and person,

26:35.260 --> 26:38.540
 so you're suffering from what we would call disorientation.

26:38.540 --> 26:41.620
 Fourth, you have wildly fluctuating emotions,

26:41.620 --> 26:43.620
 something that psychiatrists

26:43.620 --> 26:46.460
 will call being affectively labile.

26:46.460 --> 26:48.540
 And then how wonderful, you woke up this morning

26:48.540 --> 26:51.100
 and you forgot most if not all of that dream experience,

26:51.100 --> 26:52.820
 so you're suffering from amnesia.

26:52.820 --> 26:55.900
 If you were to experience any one of those five things

26:55.900 --> 26:56.900
 while you're awake,

26:56.900 --> 27:00.620
 you would probably be seeking psychological help.

27:00.620 --> 27:03.940
 But so I place that as a backdrop

27:03.940 --> 27:06.180
 against your astute question,

27:06.180 --> 27:11.060
 because despite all of that psychosis,

27:11.060 --> 27:16.060
 there is still a present self nested at the heart of it,

27:16.180 --> 27:19.780
 meaning that I think it's very difficult for us

27:19.780 --> 27:24.100
 to abandon our conscious sense of self.

27:24.100 --> 27:25.900
 And if it's that hard,

27:25.900 --> 27:27.180
 the old adage in some ways,

27:27.180 --> 27:29.260
 that you can't outrun your shadow.

27:29.260 --> 27:31.420
 But here it's more of a philosophical question,

27:31.420 --> 27:33.660
 which is about the conscious mind

27:33.660 --> 27:36.220
 and what the state of consciousness actually means

27:36.220 --> 27:37.220
 in a human being.

27:38.100 --> 27:39.580
 So I think that that to me,

27:39.580 --> 27:44.580
 you become so dislocated from so many other rational ways

27:45.860 --> 27:47.860
 of waking consciousness.

27:47.860 --> 27:49.540
 But one thing that won't go away,

27:49.540 --> 27:54.540
 that won't get perturbed or sort of, you know,

27:54.660 --> 27:58.180
 manacled, is this your sense of conscious self?

27:58.180 --> 28:00.140
 Yeah, that's a strong sign that consciousness

28:00.140 --> 28:02.380
 is fundamental to the human mind.

28:03.380 --> 28:04.900
 Or we're just creatures of habit

28:04.900 --> 28:06.860
 who gotten used to having consciousness.

28:06.860 --> 28:11.060
 Maybe it just takes a lot of either chemical substances

28:11.060 --> 28:15.980
 or a lot of like mental work to escape that.

28:15.980 --> 28:19.340
 I mean, it's like trying to launch a rocket.

28:19.340 --> 28:22.060
 You know, the energy that has to be put in

28:22.060 --> 28:24.580
 to create escape velocity

28:24.580 --> 28:26.620
 from the gravitational pull of this thing

28:26.620 --> 28:29.060
 called planet earth is immense.

28:29.060 --> 28:31.140
 Well, the same thing is true

28:31.140 --> 28:36.140
 for us to abandon our sense of conscious self.

28:36.580 --> 28:39.380
 The amount of biological, the amount of substances,

28:39.380 --> 28:42.020
 the amount of wacky stuff that you have to do

28:42.020 --> 28:46.420
 to truly get escape velocity from your conscious self.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.380
 What does that tell us about then

28:48.380 --> 28:52.220
 the fundamental state of our conscious self?

28:52.220 --> 28:55.540
 Yeah, it also probably says that it's quite useful

28:55.540 --> 28:58.700
 to have consciousness for survival

28:58.700 --> 29:01.420
 and for just operation in this world.

29:01.420 --> 29:02.820
 And perhaps for intelligence.

29:02.820 --> 29:05.020
 I'm one of the, on the AI side,

29:05.020 --> 29:10.020
 people that think that intelligence requires consciousness.

29:10.300 --> 29:12.980
 So like high levels of general intelligence

29:12.980 --> 29:14.460
 requires consciousness.

29:14.460 --> 29:17.700
 Most people in the AI field think like consciousness

29:17.700 --> 29:19.580
 and intelligence are fundamentally different.

29:19.580 --> 29:22.100
 You could build a computer that's super intelligent.

29:22.100 --> 29:23.820
 It doesn't have to be conscious.

29:23.820 --> 29:26.660
 I think that if you define super intelligence

29:26.660 --> 29:28.580
 by being good at chess, yes.

29:28.580 --> 29:30.820
 But if you define super intelligence

29:30.820 --> 29:35.020
 as being able to operate in this living world of humans

29:35.020 --> 29:37.540
 and be able to perform all kinds of different tasks,

29:37.540 --> 29:41.020
 consciousness, it seems to be somehow fundamental

29:41.860 --> 29:46.780
 to richly integrate yourself into the human experience,

29:46.780 --> 29:48.300
 into society.

29:48.300 --> 29:50.940
 It feels like you have to be a conscious being.

29:50.940 --> 29:53.420
 But then we don't even know what consciousness is

29:53.420 --> 29:55.620
 and we certainly don't know how to engineer it

29:55.620 --> 29:56.660
 in our machines.

29:56.660 --> 30:00.100
 I love the fact that there are still questions

30:00.100 --> 30:03.220
 that are so embryonic because, you know,

30:03.220 --> 30:05.620
 I suspect it's the same with you.

30:05.620 --> 30:09.820
 Answers to me are simply ways to get to more questions.

30:09.820 --> 30:12.140
 You know, it's questions where, you know,

30:12.140 --> 30:15.020
 questions turn me on, answers less so.

30:15.020 --> 30:18.820
 And I love the fact that we are still embryonic

30:18.820 --> 30:20.940
 in our sense of arguing about

30:20.940 --> 30:23.780
 even what the definition of consciousness is.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.660
 But I also find it fascinating.

30:25.660 --> 30:27.660
 I think it's thoroughly delightful

30:27.660 --> 30:30.140
 to absorb yourself in the thought.

30:30.140 --> 30:33.780
 Think about the brain and we can move back

30:33.780 --> 30:35.940
 across the complexity of phylogeny

30:35.940 --> 30:38.100
 from, you know, humans to mammals

30:38.100 --> 30:41.980
 to sort of birds to reptiles, amphibians, fish.

30:41.980 --> 30:44.900
 You can, bacteria, whatever you want.

30:44.900 --> 30:46.700
 And you can go through this and say, okay,

30:46.700 --> 30:48.700
 where is the hard line of, you know,

30:48.700 --> 30:51.220
 what we would define as consciousness?

30:51.220 --> 30:52.820
 And I'm sure it's got something to do

30:52.820 --> 30:55.300
 with the complexity of the neural system.

30:55.300 --> 30:57.540
 Of that, I'm fairly certain.

30:57.540 --> 31:01.380
 But to me, it's always been fascinating.

31:01.380 --> 31:02.500
 So what is it then?

31:02.500 --> 31:04.620
 You know, is it that I just keep adding neurons

31:04.620 --> 31:07.180
 to a Petri dish and I just keep adding them

31:07.180 --> 31:08.260
 and adding them and adding them.

31:08.260 --> 31:10.260
 At some point when I hit a critical mass

31:10.260 --> 31:13.180
 of interconnected neurons, that is the mass of the,

31:13.180 --> 31:16.220
 you know, the interconnected human brain, then bingo.

31:17.620 --> 31:19.780
 All of a sudden it kicks into gear

31:19.780 --> 31:21.300
 and we have consciousness.

31:21.300 --> 31:23.540
 Like a phase shift, phase transition of some kind.

31:23.540 --> 31:24.460
 Correct, yeah.

31:24.460 --> 31:26.260
 But there is something about the complexity

31:26.260 --> 31:27.940
 of the nervous system that I think

31:27.940 --> 31:29.260
 is fundamental to consciousness.

31:29.260 --> 31:31.420
 And the reason I bring that up is because

31:31.420 --> 31:33.700
 when we're trying to then think about creating it

31:33.700 --> 31:36.780
 in an artificial way, does that inform us

31:36.780 --> 31:39.220
 as to the complexity that we should be looking at

31:39.220 --> 31:41.300
 in terms of development?

31:41.300 --> 31:44.420
 I also think that it's a missed opportunity

31:44.420 --> 31:48.620
 in the sort of digital space for us

31:48.620 --> 31:51.380
 to try to recreate human consciousness.

31:52.260 --> 31:54.700
 We've already got human consciousness.

31:54.700 --> 31:57.460
 What if we were to think about creating

31:57.460 --> 31:59.900
 some other form of, why do we have to think

31:59.900 --> 32:03.620
 that the ultimate in the creation of, you know,

32:03.620 --> 32:07.380
 an artificial intelligence is the replication,

32:07.380 --> 32:11.900
 you know, of a human state of consciousness?

32:11.900 --> 32:16.660
 Can we not think outside of our own consciousness

32:16.660 --> 32:19.340
 and believe that there is something even more incredible

32:19.340 --> 32:22.380
 or more complimentary, more orthogonal?

32:24.220 --> 32:28.420
 So I'm sometimes perplexed that people

32:28.420 --> 32:30.540
 are trying to mimic human consciousness

32:30.540 --> 32:33.180
 rather than think about creating

32:33.180 --> 32:34.980
 something that's different.

32:34.980 --> 32:37.780
 I think of human consciousness or consciousness in general

32:37.780 --> 32:42.780
 as this magic superpower that allows us

32:42.820 --> 32:44.740
 to deeply experience the world.

32:44.740 --> 32:47.260
 And just as you're saying, I don't think that superpower

32:47.260 --> 32:49.780
 has to take the exact flavor as humans have.

32:49.780 --> 32:51.860
 That's my love for robots.

32:51.860 --> 32:56.180
 I would love to add the ability to robots

32:56.180 --> 33:00.460
 that can experience the world and other humans deeply.

33:01.780 --> 33:04.060
 I'm humbled by the fact that that idea

33:04.060 --> 33:06.940
 does not necessarily need to look anything like

33:06.940 --> 33:09.300
 how humans experience the world.

33:09.300 --> 33:14.300
 But there's a dance of human to robot connection

33:14.780 --> 33:18.500
 the same way human to dog or human to cat connection,

33:18.500 --> 33:21.820
 that there's a magic there to that interaction.

33:21.820 --> 33:23.580
 And I'm not sure how to create that magic,

33:23.580 --> 33:25.100
 but it's a worthy effort.

33:25.100 --> 33:27.940
 I also love, just exactly as you said,

33:27.940 --> 33:29.420
 on the question of consciousness

33:29.420 --> 33:31.060
 or engineering consciousness,

33:31.060 --> 33:34.020
 the fun thing about this problem

33:34.980 --> 33:38.860
 is it seems obvious to me that a hundred years from now,

33:38.860 --> 33:40.460
 no matter what we do today,

33:41.340 --> 33:43.340
 people, if we're still here,

33:43.340 --> 33:47.340
 will laugh at how silly our notions were.

33:47.340 --> 33:49.900
 So like, it's almost impossible for me to imagine

33:49.900 --> 33:54.900
 that we will truly solve this problem fully in my lifetime.

33:56.340 --> 33:57.780
 And more than that,

33:57.780 --> 34:02.620
 everything we'll do will be silly a hundred years from now,

34:02.620 --> 34:05.660
 but it's still, that makes it fun to me

34:05.660 --> 34:07.940
 because it's like you have the full freedom

34:07.940 --> 34:11.260
 to not even be right, just to try.

34:11.260 --> 34:13.100
 Just to try is freedom.

34:13.100 --> 34:15.460
 And that's how I see that.

34:15.460 --> 34:17.780
 Get me that T shirt, please.

34:17.780 --> 34:18.660
 I love that.

34:18.660 --> 34:22.100
 So, and human robot interaction is fascinating

34:22.100 --> 34:24.260
 because it's like watching dancing.

34:24.260 --> 34:28.340
 I've been dancing tango recently

34:28.340 --> 34:31.100
 and just, it's like, there is no goal.

34:31.100 --> 34:33.820
 The goal is to create something magical

34:33.820 --> 34:37.620
 and whether consciousness or emotion

34:37.620 --> 34:39.220
 or elegance of movement,

34:39.220 --> 34:43.380
 all of those things aid in the creation of the magic.

34:43.380 --> 34:46.060
 And it's a free, it's an art form to explore

34:46.060 --> 34:49.900
 how to make that, how to create that

34:49.900 --> 34:51.260
 in a way that's compelling.

34:51.260 --> 34:54.420
 Yeah, I love the line in Sense of a Woman with Al Pacino

34:54.420 --> 34:55.980
 where he's speaking about the tango

34:55.980 --> 34:57.740
 and he said, really, it's just freedom

34:57.740 --> 35:01.900
 that if you get tangled up, you just keep tangoing on.

35:01.900 --> 35:06.420
 I still, to this day, I think first or second time

35:06.420 --> 35:08.900
 I talked to Joe Rogan on his podcast,

35:08.900 --> 35:11.540
 I said, we got into this heated argument

35:11.540 --> 35:13.980
 about whether Sense of a Woman

35:13.980 --> 35:15.580
 is a better movie than John Wick.

35:16.780 --> 35:20.300
 Because it's one of my favorite movies for many reasons.

35:20.300 --> 35:23.860
 One is Sense of a Woman.

35:23.860 --> 35:24.700
 Partially.

35:24.700 --> 35:25.540
 I didn't know that, by the way.

35:25.540 --> 35:26.380
 I was just gonna.

35:26.380 --> 35:27.220
 You just.

35:27.220 --> 35:28.220
 Yeah, I didn't know if you would actually know

35:28.220 --> 35:29.060
 of the movie.

35:29.060 --> 35:29.900
 Awesome, awesome.

35:29.900 --> 35:31.900
 No, yeah, I said, I love the tango scene.

35:31.900 --> 35:34.660
 I love Al Pacino's performance.

35:34.660 --> 35:35.820
 It's a wonderful movie.

35:36.900 --> 35:39.380
 Then Joe was saying, John Wick is better.

35:39.380 --> 35:41.460
 So we, to this day, argue about this.

35:41.460 --> 35:44.980
 I think it depends on what conscious state you're in

35:44.980 --> 35:46.980
 that you would be ready and receptive to.

35:46.980 --> 35:50.460
 But Sense of a Woman, I think it has one of the best

35:50.460 --> 35:52.740
 monologues at the end of the movie

35:52.740 --> 35:57.020
 that has ever been written or at least performed.

35:57.020 --> 36:01.940
 When Al Pacino defends the younger.

36:01.940 --> 36:05.900
 Yeah, I often think about that.

36:05.900 --> 36:09.940
 There's been times in my life, I don't know about you,

36:09.940 --> 36:12.540
 where I wish I had an Al Pacino in my life,

36:12.540 --> 36:17.540
 where integrity is really important in this life.

36:18.260 --> 36:19.100
 It is.

36:19.100 --> 36:20.780
 And sometimes you find yourself in places

36:20.780 --> 36:25.560
 where there's pressure to sacrifice that integrity.

36:25.560 --> 36:29.140
 And you want, what is it, Lieutenant Colonel

36:29.140 --> 36:30.820
 or whatever he was.

36:30.820 --> 36:31.660
 To come in.

36:31.660 --> 36:32.500
 Slate.

36:32.500 --> 36:36.140
 To come in on your side and scream at everyone

36:36.140 --> 36:38.500
 and say, what the hell are we doing here?

36:38.500 --> 36:41.260
 Being, you know, unfortunately British

36:41.260 --> 36:44.340
 and sort of having that slightly awkward

36:44.340 --> 36:45.420
 sort of Hugh Grant gene.

36:45.420 --> 36:48.820
 It's very, very, very at the opposite end of the spectrum

36:48.820 --> 36:51.820
 of the remarkable feat of Al Pacino

36:51.820 --> 36:53.060
 at the end of that scene.

36:53.060 --> 36:58.060
 But, and yeah, integrity is, it's a challenging thing

36:59.160 --> 37:00.300
 and I value it much.

37:00.300 --> 37:04.900
 And I think it can take 20 years to build a reputation

37:04.900 --> 37:06.580
 and two minutes to lose it.

37:06.580 --> 37:10.420
 And there is nothing more that I value than that integrity

37:10.420 --> 37:13.580
 and, you know, if I'm ever wrong about anything,

37:13.580 --> 37:16.860
 I truly don't want to be wrong for any longer

37:16.860 --> 37:17.960
 than I have to be.

37:19.420 --> 37:22.700
 You know, that's what being in some ways a scientist is.

37:22.700 --> 37:25.460
 You're just driven by truth.

37:25.460 --> 37:29.200
 And the irony relative to something like mathematics

37:29.200 --> 37:31.900
 is that in science, you never find truth.

37:31.900 --> 37:35.460
 What you do in science is you discount the things

37:35.460 --> 37:38.020
 that are likely to be untrue,

37:38.020 --> 37:42.220
 leaving only the possibility of what could be true.

37:42.220 --> 37:46.620
 But in math, you know, when you create, you know, a proof,

37:46.620 --> 37:51.620
 it's a proof for, you know, from that point forward,

37:51.820 --> 37:54.300
 there is truth in mathematics.

37:54.300 --> 37:56.980
 And there's, I think there's a beauty in that,

37:56.980 --> 38:00.180
 but I kind of like the messiness of science

38:00.180 --> 38:03.600
 because again, to me, it's less about the truth

38:03.600 --> 38:07.220
 of the answer and it is more about the pursuit of questions.

38:07.220 --> 38:10.100
 But their integrity becomes more and more important

38:10.100 --> 38:11.800
 and it becomes more difficult.

38:11.800 --> 38:12.980
 There's a lot of pressures,

38:12.980 --> 38:14.100
 just like in the rest of the world,

38:14.100 --> 38:17.180
 but there's a lot of pressures than a scientist.

38:17.180 --> 38:19.420
 One is like funding sources.

38:19.420 --> 38:21.360
 I've noticed this, that, you know,

38:21.360 --> 38:24.580
 money affects everyone's mind, I think.

38:24.580 --> 38:28.320
 I've been always somebody that I believe money can't,

38:28.320 --> 38:31.480
 you can't buy my opinion.

38:31.480 --> 38:34.380
 I don't care how much money, billions or trillions.

38:34.380 --> 38:37.460
 But that pressure is there and you have to be

38:37.460 --> 38:40.900
 very cognizant of it and make sure that your opinion

38:40.900 --> 38:43.380
 is not defined by the funding sources.

38:43.380 --> 38:48.260
 And then the other is just your own success of, you know,

38:48.260 --> 38:50.700
 for a couple of decades, publishing an idea

38:53.860 --> 38:55.460
 and then realizing at some point

38:55.460 --> 38:57.860
 that that idea was wrong all along.

38:57.860 --> 39:00.800
 And that's a tough thing for people to do,

39:00.800 --> 39:03.200
 but that's also integrity is to walk away,

39:03.200 --> 39:04.800
 is to say that you were wrong.

39:06.180 --> 39:08.860
 That doesn't have to be in some big dramatic way.

39:08.860 --> 39:11.860
 It could be in a bunch of tiny ways along the way.

39:11.860 --> 39:12.700
 Right.

39:12.700 --> 39:17.700
 Like reconfigure your intuition about a particular problem.

39:18.800 --> 39:20.520
 That's, and all of that is integrity.

39:20.520 --> 39:23.460
 When everybody in the room, you know,

39:23.460 --> 39:24.500
 believes a certain thing,

39:24.500 --> 39:27.440
 everybody in the community believes a certain thing,

39:27.440 --> 39:31.000
 to be able to still be open minded in the face of that.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.820
 Yeah, and I think it comes down in some ways

39:33.820 --> 39:38.820
 to the issue of ego that you bond your correctness

39:38.980 --> 39:41.820
 or your rightness, your scientific theory

39:41.820 --> 39:45.820
 with your sense of ego.

39:45.820 --> 39:48.740
 You know, I've never found it that difficult to let go

39:48.740 --> 39:52.780
 of theories in the face of counter evidence

39:52.780 --> 39:56.380
 in part because I have such low self esteem.

39:56.380 --> 39:57.900
 Well, I kind of liked that.

39:57.900 --> 39:59.020
 I always liked that combination.

39:59.020 --> 40:01.620
 I have the same, I'm like very self critical,

40:01.620 --> 40:03.460
 imposter syndrome, all those things,

40:04.500 --> 40:05.740
 putting yourself below the podium,

40:05.740 --> 40:08.140
 but at the same time having the ego

40:08.140 --> 40:11.060
 that drives the ambition to work your ass off.

40:11.060 --> 40:13.520
 Like some kind of weird drive,

40:13.520 --> 40:16.740
 maybe like drive to be better.

40:16.740 --> 40:18.940
 Like thinking of yourself as not that great

40:18.940 --> 40:20.940
 and always driving to be better.

40:20.940 --> 40:22.020
 And then at the same time,

40:22.020 --> 40:25.940
 because that can be paralyzing and exhausting and so on,

40:25.940 --> 40:28.360
 at the same time, just being grateful to be alive.

40:28.360 --> 40:31.340
 But in the sciences, in the actual effort,

40:31.340 --> 40:33.940
 never be satisfied, never think of yourself highly.

40:33.940 --> 40:35.860
 It seems to be a nice combination.

40:35.860 --> 40:39.700
 I very much hope that that is part of who I am

40:39.700 --> 40:44.420
 and I remain very quietly motivated and driven.

40:44.420 --> 40:47.980
 And I, like you, love the idea of perfection

40:47.980 --> 40:49.700
 and I know I will never achieve it,

40:49.700 --> 40:51.340
 but I will never stop trying to.

40:52.220 --> 40:55.500
 So similar to you, which sounds weird

40:55.500 --> 40:59.400
 because there's all these videos of me on the internet.

41:01.060 --> 41:04.400
 So I think I just naturally lean into the things

41:04.400 --> 41:07.020
 I'm afraid of and I'm uncomfortable doing.

41:07.020 --> 41:09.120
 Like I'm very afraid of talking to people

41:09.120 --> 41:12.700
 and just even before talking to you today,

41:12.700 --> 41:16.100
 just a lot of anxiety and all those kinds of things.

41:16.100 --> 41:17.540
 About talking to me?

41:17.540 --> 41:18.380
 Yeah, yeah.

41:18.380 --> 41:19.200
 Oh, I like.

41:19.200 --> 41:20.040
 Nervousness.

41:20.940 --> 41:24.540
 Fear in some cases, self doubt and all those kinds of things.

41:24.540 --> 41:25.980
 But I do it anyway.

41:25.980 --> 41:27.480
 So the reason I bring that up

41:27.480 --> 41:32.120
 is you've launched a podcast.

41:32.120 --> 41:32.960
 I have.

41:34.540 --> 41:37.360
 Allow me to say, I think you're a great science communicator.

41:37.360 --> 41:42.360
 So this challenge of being afraid

41:44.180 --> 41:47.980
 or cautious of being in the public eye

41:47.980 --> 41:51.420
 and yet having a longing to communicate

41:51.420 --> 41:53.620
 some of the things you're excited about

41:53.620 --> 41:55.900
 in the space of sleep and beyond.

41:55.900 --> 41:57.800
 What's your vision with this project?

41:59.180 --> 42:03.620
 I think firstly to that question, like you,

42:03.620 --> 42:07.980
 I am always more afraid of not trying than trying.

42:07.980 --> 42:08.820
 Yeah.

42:08.820 --> 42:11.060
 That to me frightens me more.

42:12.040 --> 42:13.500
 But with the podcast,

42:13.500 --> 42:18.500
 I think really I have two very simple goals.

42:18.660 --> 42:22.980
 I want to try and democratize the science of sleep

42:22.980 --> 42:23.820
 and in doing so,

42:23.820 --> 42:26.420
 my goal would be to try and reunite humanity

42:26.420 --> 42:29.200
 with the sleep that it is so desperately bereft of.

42:30.540 --> 42:33.820
 And if I can do that through a number of different means,

42:35.480 --> 42:38.500
 the podcast is a little bit different than this format.

42:38.500 --> 42:43.500
 It's going to be short form monologues from yours truly

42:45.180 --> 42:47.780
 that will last usually less than just 10 minutes.

42:47.780 --> 42:51.420
 And I see it as simply a little slice of sleep goodness

42:51.420 --> 42:53.940
 that can accompany your waking day.

42:53.940 --> 42:56.380
 It's hard to know what is the right way

42:56.380 --> 42:58.440
 to do science communication.

42:58.440 --> 43:01.620
 Like your friend, mine, Andrew Huberman,

43:03.660 --> 43:05.460
 he's an incredible human being.

43:05.460 --> 43:06.300
 Oh gosh.

43:06.300 --> 43:09.420
 So he does like two hours of,

43:09.420 --> 43:10.660
 I wonder how many takes he does.

43:10.660 --> 43:12.820
 I don't know, but it looks like he doesn't do any.

43:12.820 --> 43:16.300
 Yeah, I suspect he's that magnificent of a human being.

43:16.300 --> 43:18.940
 When I talk to him in like in person,

43:18.940 --> 43:21.580
 he always generates intelligent words,

43:21.580 --> 43:24.180
 well cited, nonstop for hours.

43:24.180 --> 43:25.700
 So I don't.

43:25.700 --> 43:29.020
 He's a Gatling gun of information and it's pristine.

43:29.020 --> 43:30.700
 And passion and all those kinds of things.

43:30.700 --> 43:32.220
 So that's an interesting medium.

43:32.220 --> 43:33.940
 I wouldn't have,

43:35.260 --> 43:36.780
 it's funny because I wouldn't have done it

43:36.780 --> 43:38.020
 the way he's doing it.

43:38.020 --> 43:40.340
 I wouldn't advise him to do it the way he's doing it.

43:40.340 --> 43:41.740
 Cause I thought there's no way you could do

43:41.740 --> 43:42.580
 what you're doing.

43:43.860 --> 43:45.540
 Cause it's a lot of work,

43:45.540 --> 43:48.420
 but he is like doing an incredible job of it.

43:48.420 --> 43:51.060
 I just think it's the same with like Dan Carlin

43:51.060 --> 43:52.140
 and hardcore history.

43:52.140 --> 43:56.700
 I thought that the way Andrew's doing it

43:56.700 --> 44:00.860
 would crush him the way it crushes Dan Carlin.

44:00.860 --> 44:04.660
 So Dan has so much pressure on him to do a good job

44:04.660 --> 44:08.140
 that he ends up publishing like two episodes a year.

44:08.140 --> 44:10.100
 So that pressure can be paralyzing.

44:10.100 --> 44:13.580
 The pressure of like putting out like

44:13.580 --> 44:16.140
 strong scientific statements

44:16.140 --> 44:17.820
 that can be overwhelming.

44:17.820 --> 44:21.540
 Now, Andrew seems to be just plowing through anyway.

44:21.540 --> 44:25.220
 If there's mistakes, he'll say there's corrections and so on.

44:25.220 --> 44:26.220
 I just, I wonder,

44:26.220 --> 44:27.900
 I actually haven't talked to him too much about it.

44:27.900 --> 44:30.820
 Like psychologically, how difficult is it

44:30.820 --> 44:34.700
 to put yourself out there for an hour to a week

44:34.700 --> 44:37.060
 of just nonstop dropping knowledge.

44:37.980 --> 44:41.140
 Any one sentence of which could be totally wrong.

44:41.140 --> 44:42.300
 It could be a mistake.

44:42.300 --> 44:44.260
 And there will be mistakes.

44:44.260 --> 44:47.460
 And I, in the first edition of my book,

44:47.460 --> 44:50.020
 there were errors that we corrected

44:50.020 --> 44:51.500
 in the second edition too.

44:52.420 --> 44:55.860
 But there will be probabilistically,

44:55.860 --> 44:59.100
 if you've got 10 facts per page of a book

44:59.100 --> 45:02.500
 and you've got 350 pages,

45:02.500 --> 45:05.260
 odds are it's probably not going to be

45:05.260 --> 45:07.420
 utter perfection out the gate.

45:07.420 --> 45:10.820
 And it will be the same way for Andrew too.

45:11.780 --> 45:15.620
 But having the reverence of

45:15.620 --> 45:19.380
 a humble mind

45:19.380 --> 45:21.940
 and simply accepting the things that are wrong

45:21.940 --> 45:23.900
 and correcting them and doing the right thing.

45:23.900 --> 45:26.620
 I know that that's his mentality.

45:26.620 --> 45:30.260
 I do want to say that I'm just kind of honored to be,

45:30.260 --> 45:34.780
 it's a cool group of like scientific people

45:34.780 --> 45:38.060
 that I'm fortunate enough to now be interacting with.

45:38.060 --> 45:41.180
 It's you and Andrew and David Sinclair

45:41.180 --> 45:43.100
 has been thinking about throwing his hat in the ring.

45:43.100 --> 45:43.940
 Oh, I hope so.

45:43.940 --> 45:46.740
 David is another one of those very special people

45:46.740 --> 45:47.580
 in the world.

45:47.580 --> 45:51.100
 So it's cool because podcasts are, it's cool.

45:51.100 --> 45:53.460
 It's such a powerful medium of communication.

45:53.460 --> 45:56.540
 It's much freer than more constrained

45:56.540 --> 45:58.420
 like publications and so on.

45:58.420 --> 46:01.860
 Or it's much more accessible and inspiring than like,

46:01.860 --> 46:04.020
 I don't know, conference presentations or lectures.

46:04.020 --> 46:06.900
 And so it's a really exciting medium to me.

46:06.900 --> 46:08.860
 And it's cool that there's this like group of people

46:08.860 --> 46:12.700
 that are becoming friends and putting stuff out there

46:12.700 --> 46:13.660
 and supporting each other.

46:13.660 --> 46:18.140
 So it's fun to also watch how that's going to evolve

46:18.140 --> 46:20.860
 in your case, because I wonder it'll be two a month.

46:20.860 --> 46:24.980
 Or devolve is the answer to that.

46:24.980 --> 46:27.700
 Well, I mean, some of it is persistence

46:27.700 --> 46:30.220
 through the challenges that we've been talking about,

46:30.220 --> 46:31.060
 which is like.

46:31.060 --> 46:32.460
 I think I've got a lot to learn.

46:32.460 --> 46:33.300
 Yeah.

46:33.300 --> 46:34.140
 But I will persist.

46:35.700 --> 46:37.460
 Can I ask you some detailed stuff?

46:37.460 --> 46:38.300
 You mentioned that.

46:38.300 --> 46:41.620
 Oh my goodness, go anywhere you wish with sleep.

46:41.620 --> 46:45.300
 So I'm a big fan of coffee and caffeine.

46:45.300 --> 46:47.820
 And I've been, especially in the last few days,

46:47.820 --> 46:50.140
 consuming a very large amount.

46:50.140 --> 46:55.140
 And I'm cognizant of the fact that my body is affected

46:55.660 --> 46:59.020
 by caffeine different than the anecdotal information

46:59.020 --> 47:00.740
 that other people tell me.

47:00.740 --> 47:03.900
 I seem to be not at all affected by it.

47:03.900 --> 47:08.900
 It's almost, it feels like more like a ritual

47:08.900 --> 47:12.140
 than it is a chemical boost to my performance.

47:12.140 --> 47:15.380
 Like I can drink several cups of coffee right before bed

47:15.380 --> 47:17.740
 and just knock out anyway.

47:17.740 --> 47:20.220
 I'm not sure if it's a biological chemical

47:20.220 --> 47:21.540
 or it has to do with just the fact

47:21.540 --> 47:24.340
 that I'm consuming huge amounts of caffeine.

47:24.340 --> 47:29.340
 All that to say, what do you think is the relationship

47:29.540 --> 47:32.900
 between coffee and sleep, caffeine and sleep?

47:32.900 --> 47:34.380
 If there's an interesting distinction there.

47:34.380 --> 47:35.660
 There is a distinction.

47:35.660 --> 47:37.580
 So I think the first thing to say,

47:37.580 --> 47:40.180
 which is going to sound strange coming from me

47:40.180 --> 47:41.620
 is drink coffee.

47:43.540 --> 47:46.460
 The health benefits associated with drinking coffee

47:46.460 --> 47:49.780
 are really quite well established now.

47:51.140 --> 47:54.180
 But I think that the counterpoint to that,

47:54.180 --> 47:57.860
 well, firstly, the dose and the timing make the poison.

47:57.860 --> 48:01.220
 And I'll perhaps come back to that in just a second.

48:01.220 --> 48:06.220
 But for coffee, it's actually not the caffeine.

48:06.220 --> 48:09.620
 So, a lot of people have asked me

48:09.620 --> 48:12.140
 about this rightful paradox between the fact

48:12.140 --> 48:15.580
 that sleep provides all of these incredible health benefits

48:15.580 --> 48:19.460
 and then coffee, which can have a deleterious impact

48:19.460 --> 48:23.020
 on your sleep has a whole collection of health benefits.

48:23.020 --> 48:25.460
 Many of them Venn diagram overlapping

48:25.460 --> 48:27.380
 with those that sleep provides.

48:27.380 --> 48:30.220
 How on earth can you reconcile those two?

48:30.220 --> 48:33.740
 And the answer is that, well, the answer is very simple.

48:33.740 --> 48:37.780
 It's called antioxidants, that it turns out

48:37.780 --> 48:40.820
 that for most people in Western civilization

48:40.820 --> 48:44.060
 because of diet, not being quite what it should be,

48:44.940 --> 48:49.300
 the major source through which they obtain antioxidants

48:49.300 --> 48:50.380
 is the coffee bean.

48:50.380 --> 48:53.700
 So the humble coffee bean has now been asked

48:53.700 --> 48:57.580
 to carry the astronomical weight of serving up

48:57.580 --> 49:01.900
 the large majority of people's antioxidant needs.

49:01.900 --> 49:04.820
 And you can see this if, for example,

49:04.820 --> 49:08.340
 you look at the health benefits of decaffeinated coffee,

49:08.340 --> 49:10.260
 it has a whole constellation

49:10.260 --> 49:12.100
 of really great health benefits too.

49:12.100 --> 49:13.420
 So it's not the caffeine.

49:13.420 --> 49:15.300
 And that's why I liked what you said,

49:15.300 --> 49:17.740
 this sort of separation of church and state

49:17.740 --> 49:19.900
 between coffee and caffeine.

49:19.900 --> 49:23.340
 It's not the caffeine, it's the coffee bean itself

49:23.340 --> 49:24.820
 that provides those health benefits.

49:24.820 --> 49:29.620
 But coming back to how it impacts sleep,

49:29.620 --> 49:33.540
 it impacts sleep in probably at least three different ways.

49:33.540 --> 49:37.060
 The first is that for most people,

49:37.060 --> 49:39.460
 caffeine can make it obviously a little harder

49:39.460 --> 49:41.140
 to fall asleep.

49:41.140 --> 49:44.060
 Caffeine can make it harder to stay asleep.

49:44.060 --> 49:46.100
 But let's say that you are one of those individuals

49:46.100 --> 49:48.060
 and I think you are, and you can say,

49:48.060 --> 49:50.700
 look, I can have three or four espressos with dinner

49:50.700 --> 49:52.300
 and I fall asleep just fine

49:52.300 --> 49:54.500
 and I stay asleep soundly across the night.

49:54.500 --> 49:56.220
 So there's no problem.

49:56.220 --> 50:00.300
 The downside there is that even if that is true,

50:00.300 --> 50:03.820
 the amount of deep sleep that you get will not be as deep.

50:03.820 --> 50:05.500
 And so you will actually lose somewhere

50:05.500 --> 50:08.500
 between 10 to 30% of your deep sleep

50:08.500 --> 50:11.300
 if you drink caffeine in the evening.

50:11.300 --> 50:12.940
 So to give you some context,

50:12.940 --> 50:16.460
 to drop your deep sleep by let's say 20%,

50:16.460 --> 50:19.260
 I'd probably have to age you by 15 years,

50:19.260 --> 50:22.540
 or you could do it every night with a cup of coffee.

50:22.540 --> 50:24.140
 I think the fourth component

50:24.140 --> 50:27.140
 that is perhaps less well understood about coffee

50:27.140 --> 50:29.660
 is its timing, and that's why I was saying

50:29.660 --> 50:31.580
 the timing and the dose make the poison.

50:31.580 --> 50:32.900
 The dose, by the way,

50:32.900 --> 50:35.820
 once you get past about three cups of coffee a day,

50:35.820 --> 50:38.420
 the health benefits actually start to turn down

50:38.420 --> 50:40.220
 in the opposite direction.

50:40.220 --> 50:41.980
 So there is a U shape function.

50:41.980 --> 50:44.220
 It's sort of the Goldilocks syndrome,

50:44.220 --> 50:47.980
 not too little, not too much, just the right amount.

50:47.980 --> 50:50.700
 The second component is the timing though.

50:50.700 --> 50:55.220
 Caffeine has half life of about five to six hours,

50:55.220 --> 50:57.820
 meaning that after five to six hours,

50:57.820 --> 51:01.140
 50% of that on average for the average adult

51:01.140 --> 51:02.500
 is still in the system,

51:02.500 --> 51:06.020
 which means that it has a quarter life of 10 to 12 hours.

51:06.020 --> 51:08.260
 So in other words, if you have a coffee at noon,

51:08.260 --> 51:10.580
 a quarter of that caffeine is still circulating

51:10.580 --> 51:12.620
 in your brain at midnight.

51:12.620 --> 51:14.820
 So having a cup of coffee at noon,

51:14.820 --> 51:16.220
 one could argue is the equivalent

51:16.220 --> 51:18.060
 of tucking yourself into bed at midnight,

51:18.060 --> 51:19.580
 and before you turn the light out,

51:19.580 --> 51:22.180
 you swig a quarter of a cup of coffee.

51:22.180 --> 51:24.300
 But that doesn't still answer your question

51:24.300 --> 51:26.220
 as to why are you so immune?

51:26.220 --> 51:28.140
 So I'm someone who is actually unfortunately

51:28.140 --> 51:29.500
 very sensitive to caffeine.

51:29.500 --> 51:34.060
 And if I have even two cups of coffee in the morning,

51:34.980 --> 51:37.260
 I don't sleep as well that night.

51:37.260 --> 51:40.660
 And I find it miserable because I love the smell of coffee.

51:40.660 --> 51:41.940
 I love the routine.

51:41.940 --> 51:43.540
 I love the ritual.

51:43.540 --> 51:46.220
 I think I would love to be invested in it.

51:46.220 --> 51:47.620
 It's just terrible for my sleep.

51:47.620 --> 51:49.420
 So I switched to decaf.

51:49.420 --> 51:52.620
 There is a difference from one individual to the next,

51:52.620 --> 51:56.660
 and it's controlled by a set of liver enzymes

51:56.660 --> 52:00.740
 called cytochrome P450 enzymes.

52:00.740 --> 52:03.020
 And there is a particular gene

52:03.020 --> 52:06.660
 that if you have a different sort of version of this gene,

52:06.660 --> 52:11.580
 it's called CYP1A2.

52:11.580 --> 52:14.700
 That gene will determine the speed

52:14.700 --> 52:18.100
 of the clearance of caffeine from your system.

52:18.100 --> 52:20.260
 Some people will have a version of that gene

52:20.260 --> 52:23.020
 that is very effective and efficient

52:23.020 --> 52:24.660
 at clearing that caffeine.

52:24.660 --> 52:28.460
 And so their half life could be as short as two hours

52:28.460 --> 52:30.900
 rather than five to six hours.

52:30.900 --> 52:34.100
 Other people, hands up Matt Walker,

52:34.100 --> 52:35.700
 have a version of that gene

52:35.700 --> 52:40.340
 that is not very effective at clearing out the caffeine.

52:40.340 --> 52:43.700
 And therefore their half life sort of sensitivity

52:43.700 --> 52:48.140
 could be somewhere between eight to nine hours.

52:48.140 --> 52:50.740
 So we understand that there are individual differences,

52:50.740 --> 52:55.740
 but overall, I guess the top line here is drink coffee

52:56.580 --> 52:58.420
 and understand that it's not the caffeine,

52:58.420 --> 53:00.060
 it's the coffee that's the benefit

53:00.060 --> 53:01.300
 and the dose makes the poison.

53:01.300 --> 53:04.860
 Is there some aspect to it that it's like a muscle

53:04.860 --> 53:08.220
 in terms of all the combination of letters and numbers

53:08.220 --> 53:09.060
 that you just said?

53:09.060 --> 53:13.860
 Is there some aspect that if I can improve

53:13.860 --> 53:15.740
 the quarter life, the half life,

53:15.740 --> 53:19.060
 could decrease that number if I just practice?

53:19.940 --> 53:21.380
 Like I drink a lot of coffee,

53:21.380 --> 53:25.500
 so like habit alters how your body's able

53:25.500 --> 53:27.180
 to get rid of the caffeine.

53:27.180 --> 53:30.180
 Not how the body is able to get rid of the caffeine,

53:30.180 --> 53:34.540
 but it does alter how sensitive the body is to the caffeine.

53:34.540 --> 53:36.700
 And it's not at the level of the enzyme

53:36.700 --> 53:38.780
 degrading the caffeine.

53:38.780 --> 53:41.460
 It's at the level of the receptors

53:41.460 --> 53:44.100
 that caffeine will act upon.

53:44.100 --> 53:46.940
 Now it turns out that those are called adenosine receptors

53:46.940 --> 53:49.100
 and maybe we can speak about what adenosine is

53:49.100 --> 53:51.180
 and sleep pressure and all of that good stuff.

53:51.180 --> 53:55.260
 But as you start to drink more and more coffee,

53:56.300 --> 53:58.940
 the body tries to fight back

53:58.940 --> 54:01.100
 and it happens with many different drugs by the way,

54:01.100 --> 54:03.100
 and it's called tolerance.

54:03.100 --> 54:06.660
 And so one of the ways that your body becomes tolerant

54:06.660 --> 54:10.100
 to a drug is that the receptors that the drug is binding to,

54:10.100 --> 54:13.900
 these sort of welcome sites, these sort of picture myths,

54:13.900 --> 54:16.300
 as it were, that receive the drug,

54:16.300 --> 54:21.300
 those start to get taken away from the surface of the cell

54:21.620 --> 54:25.100
 and it's what we call receptor internalization.

54:25.100 --> 54:28.260
 So the cell starts to think, gee whiz,

54:28.260 --> 54:31.420
 there's a lot of stimulation going on, this is too much.

54:31.420 --> 54:35.580
 So I'm just going to, when normally I would coat my cell

54:35.580 --> 54:38.780
 with let's just say five of these receptors

54:38.780 --> 54:40.620
 for argument's sake,

54:40.620 --> 54:43.260
 things are going a little bit too ballistic right now.

54:43.260 --> 54:46.100
 I'm going to take away at least two of those receptors

54:46.100 --> 54:49.100
 and downscale it to just having three of those.

54:49.100 --> 54:52.860
 And now you need two cups of coffee to get the same effect

54:52.860 --> 54:55.540
 that one cup of coffee got you before.

54:55.540 --> 55:00.540
 And that's why then when you go cold turkey on coffee,

55:01.020 --> 55:05.380
 all of a sudden the system has equilibrated itself

55:05.380 --> 55:08.540
 to expecting X amount of stimulation

55:08.540 --> 55:10.140
 and now all of that stimulation is gone.

55:10.140 --> 55:12.940
 So it's now got too few receptors

55:12.940 --> 55:15.660
 and you have a caffeine withdrawal syndrome.

55:15.660 --> 55:18.500
 And that's why, for example, with drugs of abuse,

55:18.500 --> 55:22.540
 things like heroin, when people go into abstinence,

55:23.700 --> 55:26.700
 as they're sort of moving into their addiction,

55:26.700 --> 55:30.620
 they will build up a progressive tolerance to that drug.

55:30.620 --> 55:34.140
 So they need to take more of it to get the same high.

55:34.140 --> 55:38.140
 But then if they go cold turkey for some period of time,

55:38.140 --> 55:40.620
 the system goes back to being more sensitive again.

55:40.620 --> 55:43.380
 It starts to repopulate the surface of the cell

55:43.380 --> 55:44.660
 with these receptors.

55:44.660 --> 55:47.660
 But now when they reuse and they fall off the wagon,

55:47.660 --> 55:49.420
 if they go back to the same dose

55:49.420 --> 55:53.060
 that they were using before 10 weeks ago

55:53.060 --> 55:56.500
 or three months ago, that dose can kill them.

55:56.500 --> 55:58.140
 They can have an overdose.

55:58.140 --> 56:00.300
 Even though they were using the same amount

56:00.300 --> 56:02.260
 at those two different times,

56:02.260 --> 56:05.780
 the difference is that it's not the dose of the drug,

56:05.780 --> 56:08.140
 it's the sensitivity of the system.

56:08.140 --> 56:10.980
 And that's the same thing that we see with caffeine.

56:10.980 --> 56:13.780
 In terms of training the muscle, as it were,

56:13.780 --> 56:16.580
 the system becomes less sensitive, can calibrate.

56:17.620 --> 56:22.620
 Is there a time, the number of hours before bed,

56:22.900 --> 56:26.620
 that's a safe bet to most people to recommend

56:27.500 --> 56:31.220
 you shouldn't drink caffeine this many hours?

56:31.220 --> 56:33.420
 Like, is there an average half life

56:33.420 --> 56:35.380
 that you should be aiming at?

56:35.380 --> 56:38.060
 Or is this advice kind of impossible

56:38.060 --> 56:39.580
 because there's so much variability?

56:39.580 --> 56:41.260
 There is huge variability.

56:41.260 --> 56:45.300
 And I think everyone themselves to a degree knows it,

56:45.300 --> 56:47.980
 although I'll put a caveat on that too

56:47.980 --> 56:50.420
 because it's a slightly dangerous point.

56:50.420 --> 56:53.180
 So the recommendation for the average adult

56:53.180 --> 56:55.660
 and who, where is the average adult in society?

56:55.660 --> 56:56.540
 There is no such thing.

56:56.540 --> 56:58.460
 But for the average adult,

56:58.460 --> 57:02.540
 it would be probably cutting yourself off maybe 10 hours

57:02.540 --> 57:03.380
 before.

57:03.380 --> 57:06.260
 So assuming a normative bedtime in society,

57:06.260 --> 57:10.900
 I would say try to stop drinking caffeine before 2 p.m.

57:10.900 --> 57:13.140
 and just keep an eye out.

57:13.140 --> 57:14.500
 And if you're struggling with sleep,

57:14.500 --> 57:18.060
 dial down the caffeine and see if it makes a difference.

57:18.060 --> 57:22.500
 Can I ask you about sleep and learning?

57:22.500 --> 57:25.420
 So how does sleep affect learning?

57:25.420 --> 57:30.420
 Sleep before learning, sleep after learning,

57:30.420 --> 57:33.100
 which are both fascinating kind of dynamics

57:33.100 --> 57:36.580
 of the mind's interaction with this extra conscious state.

57:37.940 --> 57:42.260
 Yeah, sleep is profoundly and very intimately related

57:42.260 --> 57:45.700
 to your memory systems and your informational systems.

57:46.620 --> 57:48.660
 The first is you just mentioned is that

57:48.660 --> 57:53.380
 sleep before learning will essentially prepare your brain

57:53.380 --> 57:56.820
 almost like a dry sponge ready to sort of,

57:56.820 --> 57:59.140
 you know, initially soak up new information.

57:59.140 --> 58:01.180
 In other words, you need sleep before learning

58:01.180 --> 58:04.900
 to effectively imprint information into the brain

58:04.900 --> 58:07.900
 to lay down fresh memory traces.

58:07.900 --> 58:10.980
 And without sleep, the memory circuits of the brain,

58:10.980 --> 58:13.940
 and we know we've studied these memory circuits,

58:13.940 --> 58:16.980
 will, you know, they essentially become waterlogged

58:16.980 --> 58:18.460
 as it were for the sponge analogy,

58:18.460 --> 58:23.460
 and you can't absorb the information as effectively.

58:23.900 --> 58:26.300
 So you need sleep before learning,

58:26.300 --> 58:30.140
 but you also need sleep unfortunately after learning too,

58:30.140 --> 58:33.580
 to then take those freshly minted memories

58:33.580 --> 58:36.180
 and effectively hit the save button on them,

58:36.180 --> 58:38.700
 but it's nowhere near as quick as a digital system.

58:38.700 --> 58:42.100
 It takes hours because it's a physical biological change

58:42.100 --> 58:45.020
 that happens at the level of brain cells.

58:45.020 --> 58:49.500
 But sleep after learning will cement and solidify

58:49.500 --> 58:53.300
 that new memory into the neural architecture of the brain,

58:53.300 --> 58:56.900
 therefore making it less likely to be forgotten.

58:56.900 --> 59:01.300
 So, you know, I often think of sleep in that way as,

59:01.300 --> 59:04.580
 it's almost sort of future proofing information.

59:04.580 --> 59:06.940
 In what way?

59:06.940 --> 59:11.940
 Well, it means that it gives it a higher degree of assurance

59:11.940 --> 59:15.060
 to be remembered in the future

59:15.060 --> 59:19.380
 rather than go through the sort of degradation

59:19.380 --> 59:21.260
 that we think of as forgetting.

59:22.180 --> 59:26.380
 So the brain has in some ways by default,

59:26.380 --> 59:28.140
 you know, there is forget,

59:28.140 --> 59:29.900
 and actually I would love to,

59:29.900 --> 59:31.900
 I was going to say sleep is relevant for memory

59:31.900 --> 59:33.220
 in three different ways,

59:33.220 --> 59:34.700
 but I'm going to amend that

59:34.700 --> 59:36.820
 and say there's four different ways,

59:36.820 --> 59:41.820
 which is learning, maintaining, memorizing,

59:42.940 --> 59:47.740
 abstraction, assimilation, association, then forgetting,

59:47.740 --> 59:50.460
 which the last one sounds oxymoronic

59:50.460 --> 59:53.460
 based on the former three, but I'll see if I can explain.

59:53.460 --> 59:56.140
 So sleep after learning then sort of, you know,

59:57.420 --> 1:00:02.420
 sets that information like amber in solidification.

1:00:02.420 --> 1:00:05.780
 The third benefit, however, is that sleep,

1:00:05.780 --> 1:00:08.660
 we've learned more recently is much more intelligent

1:00:08.660 --> 1:00:10.700
 than we ever gave it credit for.

1:00:10.700 --> 1:00:14.380
 Sleep doesn't simply just take individual memories

1:00:14.380 --> 1:00:15.980
 and strengthen them.

1:00:15.980 --> 1:00:20.260
 Sleep will then intelligently integrate and cross link

1:00:20.260 --> 1:00:23.260
 and associate that information together.

1:00:24.220 --> 1:00:27.420
 And it's almost like informational alchemy.

1:00:27.420 --> 1:00:29.220
 So that you wake up the next morning

1:00:29.220 --> 1:00:33.220
 with a revised mind wide web of associations.

1:00:34.740 --> 1:00:36.820
 And that's probably the reason that, you know,

1:00:36.820 --> 1:00:39.380
 you've never been told to stay awake on a problem.

1:00:40.740 --> 1:00:44.900
 And in every language that I've inquired about that phrase

1:00:44.900 --> 1:00:47.940
 or something very similar seems to exist,

1:00:47.940 --> 1:00:52.620
 which means to me that this creative associative benefit

1:00:52.620 --> 1:00:55.140
 of sleep transcends cultural boundaries.

1:00:55.140 --> 1:00:58.380
 It is a common experience across humanity.

1:00:58.380 --> 1:01:03.380
 Now I should note that I think the French translation

1:01:05.140 --> 1:01:07.340
 of that is much closer to you.

1:01:07.340 --> 1:01:08.980
 I think you sleep with a problem.

1:01:08.980 --> 1:01:11.340
 Whereas the British, you sleep on a problem.

1:01:11.340 --> 1:01:12.900
 The French, you sleep with a problem.

1:01:12.900 --> 1:01:15.060
 I think it says so much about the romantic difference

1:01:15.060 --> 1:01:18.660
 between the British and the French, but let's not go there.

1:01:19.580 --> 1:01:20.420
 That's brilliant.

1:01:20.420 --> 1:01:23.380
 So such a subtle, but such a fundamental difference.

1:01:23.380 --> 1:01:24.220
 Yeah.

1:01:24.220 --> 1:01:25.660
 Oh, goodness me.

1:01:25.660 --> 1:01:27.260
 Sleep with the problem.

1:01:27.260 --> 1:01:28.540
 Yes, exactly.

1:01:28.540 --> 1:01:29.940
 That's why I love the French.

1:01:31.380 --> 1:01:35.140
 So, and we can sort of double click on any one of these

1:01:35.140 --> 1:01:38.620
 and go into detail, but the fourth,

1:01:38.620 --> 1:01:43.620
 I became really enchanted by about eight years ago

1:01:44.020 --> 1:01:46.860
 in our research, which was this idea of forgetting.

1:01:48.380 --> 1:01:52.900
 And I started to think that forgetting may be the price

1:01:52.900 --> 1:01:54.580
 that we pay for remembering.

1:01:54.580 --> 1:01:59.580
 And in that sense, there is an enormous benefit

1:02:03.300 --> 1:02:04.500
 to letting go.

1:02:05.940 --> 1:02:08.380
 And you may be thinking, that sounds ridiculous.

1:02:08.380 --> 1:02:09.740
 I don't want to forget.

1:02:09.740 --> 1:02:13.220
 In fact, my biggest problem is I keep forgetting things,

1:02:13.220 --> 1:02:17.900
 but the brain has a, well, we believe,

1:02:17.900 --> 1:02:20.500
 has a finite storage capacity.

1:02:20.500 --> 1:02:22.500
 We can't prove it yet, but my suspicion is

1:02:22.500 --> 1:02:23.460
 that that's probably true.

1:02:23.460 --> 1:02:25.540
 It doesn't have an infinite storage capacity.

1:02:25.540 --> 1:02:26.860
 It has constraints.

1:02:27.780 --> 1:02:31.540
 If that's the case, we can't simply go through life

1:02:31.540 --> 1:02:36.420
 being constantly informational aggregators

1:02:37.740 --> 1:02:39.860
 unless we are programmed to say,

1:02:39.860 --> 1:02:43.140
 we've got a hard drive space of about 85 to 90 years

1:02:43.140 --> 1:02:44.780
 and we're good and we can do that.

1:02:44.780 --> 1:02:45.940
 Maybe that's true.

1:02:45.940 --> 1:02:46.940
 I don't think that's true.

1:02:46.940 --> 1:02:50.620
 I think forgetting is an incredibly good and useful thing.

1:02:50.620 --> 1:02:54.180
 So for example, it's not beneficial

1:02:54.180 --> 1:02:57.100
 from an evolutionary perspective for me to remember

1:02:57.100 --> 1:02:59.340
 where I parked my car three years ago.

1:03:00.780 --> 1:03:04.740
 So it's important that I can remember today's parking spot,

1:03:04.740 --> 1:03:08.100
 but I don't want to have the junk kind of DNA

1:03:08.100 --> 1:03:12.940
 from a memory perspective of where I parked my car

1:03:12.940 --> 1:03:13.980
 two years ago.

1:03:15.020 --> 1:03:17.220
 Now, I actually have in some ways a problem

1:03:17.220 --> 1:03:19.460
 with forgetting, and again, I'm not trying

1:03:19.460 --> 1:03:22.260
 to sort of be laudatory, but you know,

1:03:22.260 --> 1:03:24.900
 I tend not to forget too many things.

1:03:24.900 --> 1:03:27.140
 And I don't think that that's a good thing.

1:03:27.140 --> 1:03:31.500
 And there's a wonderful neurologist, Luria,

1:03:31.500 --> 1:03:35.380
 who wrote a book called The Mind of the Mnemonicist.

1:03:35.380 --> 1:03:37.900
 And it was a brilliant book,

1:03:37.900 --> 1:03:40.660
 both because it was written exquisitely,

1:03:40.660 --> 1:03:44.820
 but he was studying these sort of memory savants

1:03:44.820 --> 1:03:49.420
 who basically could remember everything that he gave them.

1:03:49.420 --> 1:03:53.540
 And he tried to find a chink in their armor.

1:03:53.540 --> 1:03:56.860
 And the first half of the book is essentially about him

1:03:56.860 --> 1:04:01.700
 seeing how far he can push them before they fail.

1:04:01.700 --> 1:04:03.740
 And he never found that place.

1:04:03.740 --> 1:04:08.740
 He could never find a place where they stopped remembering.

1:04:08.980 --> 1:04:10.740
 And then in his brilliance,

1:04:10.740 --> 1:04:13.060
 he turned the question on its head.

1:04:13.060 --> 1:04:17.660
 He said, not what is the benefit of constantly remembering,

1:04:17.660 --> 1:04:22.220
 but instead, what is the detriment to never forgetting?

1:04:22.220 --> 1:04:24.700
 And when you start to realize his descriptions

1:04:24.700 --> 1:04:26.980
 of those individuals, it's probably a life

1:04:26.980 --> 1:04:28.180
 that you would not want.

1:04:29.540 --> 1:04:31.860
 But it's fascinating both from a human perspective,

1:04:31.860 --> 1:04:33.460
 but also AI perspective.

1:04:33.460 --> 1:04:38.300
 There's a big challenge in the machine learning community

1:04:38.300 --> 1:04:40.620
 of how to build systems that are able to remember

1:04:40.620 --> 1:04:44.900
 for prolonged periods of time, lifelong continuous learning.

1:04:44.900 --> 1:04:48.100
 So where you build up information over time.

1:04:48.100 --> 1:04:51.140
 So memory is one of the biggest open problems

1:04:51.140 --> 1:04:54.580
 in AI and machine learning.

1:04:54.580 --> 1:04:55.820
 But at the same time,

1:04:55.820 --> 1:05:00.140
 the right way to formulate memory is actually forgetting

1:05:00.140 --> 1:05:03.460
 because you have to be exceptionally selective

1:05:03.460 --> 1:05:05.540
 at which kind of stuff you remember.

1:05:05.540 --> 1:05:07.420
 And that's where the step of assimilation,

1:05:07.420 --> 1:05:09.900
 integration that you're referring to is really important.

1:05:09.900 --> 1:05:12.660
 I mean, we forget most of the things.

1:05:12.660 --> 1:05:16.660
 And the question is exactly the cost of forgetting

1:05:16.660 --> 1:05:20.380
 at the very edge of stuff that could be important

1:05:20.380 --> 1:05:24.140
 or could not be, how do we remember or not those things?

1:05:24.140 --> 1:05:28.340
 Like for example, doing a podcast,

1:05:28.340 --> 1:05:32.340
 I've become cognizant of one feature of my forgetting

1:05:32.340 --> 1:05:36.780
 that's been problematic, which is I forget names

1:05:36.780 --> 1:05:39.340
 and titles of books and so on.

1:05:39.340 --> 1:05:43.540
 So when I read, I remember ideas.

1:05:43.540 --> 1:05:47.020
 I remember quotes, I remember statements

1:05:47.020 --> 1:05:50.340
 and like that's the space in which I'm thinking.

1:05:50.340 --> 1:05:53.060
 But when you communicate to others,

1:05:53.060 --> 1:05:56.660
 you have to say this person in this book said that.

1:05:56.660 --> 1:05:59.300
 So it's the same thing with like Andrew Huberman

1:05:59.300 --> 1:06:01.140
 is masterful at this.

1:06:01.140 --> 1:06:02.500
 This is important academia,

1:06:02.500 --> 1:06:04.300
 remembering the authors of a paper

1:06:04.300 --> 1:06:09.060
 and the title of the paper as part of remembering the idea.

1:06:09.060 --> 1:06:12.940
 And I've been feeling the cost of not being able

1:06:12.940 --> 1:06:15.460
 to naturally remember those things.

1:06:15.460 --> 1:06:17.940
 And so that's something I need to sort of work on,

1:06:17.940 --> 1:06:18.780
 but that's an example.

1:06:18.780 --> 1:06:20.060
 Are you good with faces?

1:06:20.060 --> 1:06:21.540
 Yes, very good at faces.

1:06:21.540 --> 1:06:23.060
 But not good with names.

1:06:23.060 --> 1:06:25.140
 So I am exactly like you.

1:06:25.140 --> 1:06:28.860
 And there is an understanding of that in the brain too.

1:06:28.860 --> 1:06:31.580
 We understand that there is partitioning of those

1:06:31.580 --> 1:06:33.260
 in terms of the territory of the brain

1:06:33.260 --> 1:06:36.060
 that takes care of faces and facts and places

1:06:36.060 --> 1:06:37.940
 and that they can be separate.

1:06:37.940 --> 1:06:40.540
 So I will never forget a face,

1:06:40.540 --> 1:06:44.460
 but as I said, I usually forget very little,

1:06:44.460 --> 1:06:47.580
 but for some reason, names are a struggle.

1:06:47.580 --> 1:06:48.420
 I think in some ways,

1:06:48.420 --> 1:06:50.900
 because I'm probably just a slightly anxious person.

1:06:50.900 --> 1:06:52.140
 So when you first meet someone,

1:06:52.140 --> 1:06:55.340
 which is usually the time when a name is introduced,

1:06:55.340 --> 1:06:57.460
 you were saying you were sort of anxious maybe

1:06:57.460 --> 1:06:59.700
 about sort of sitting down with me,

1:06:59.700 --> 1:07:04.340
 but I find that a little bit activating.

1:07:04.340 --> 1:07:06.780
 And so it's not as though there's anything wrong

1:07:06.780 --> 1:07:07.620
 with my memory.

1:07:07.620 --> 1:07:09.500
 It's just the emotional state I'm in

1:07:09.500 --> 1:07:11.580
 when I'm first meeting someone.

1:07:11.580 --> 1:07:12.780
 It's a little bit perturbing,

1:07:12.780 --> 1:07:15.300
 but I will never forget the face.

1:07:15.300 --> 1:07:16.580
 I completely relate to that

1:07:16.580 --> 1:07:19.140
 because I almost don't hear people's names

1:07:19.140 --> 1:07:21.420
 when they tell me because I'm so anxious.

1:07:21.420 --> 1:07:22.900
 Yeah.

1:07:22.900 --> 1:07:27.260
 But I think there's certain quirks of social interaction

1:07:27.260 --> 1:07:30.460
 that show that you care about the person,

1:07:30.460 --> 1:07:31.860
 that you remember that person,

1:07:31.860 --> 1:07:33.580
 that they matter to you,

1:07:33.580 --> 1:07:35.580
 that they had an impact on you.

1:07:35.580 --> 1:07:36.980
 And one of the ways to show that

1:07:36.980 --> 1:07:39.020
 is you remember their name.

1:07:39.020 --> 1:07:40.060
 But that's a quirk to me

1:07:40.060 --> 1:07:45.060
 because a lot of people I meet have a deep impact on me,

1:07:46.140 --> 1:07:50.700
 but I can't communicate that unless I know their name,

1:07:50.700 --> 1:07:54.980
 unless I know some of the details

1:07:54.980 --> 1:07:58.700
 that we humans seem to use to communicate

1:07:58.700 --> 1:08:00.180
 that we remember each other.

1:08:00.180 --> 1:08:04.980
 What I remember well is the feeling we shared,

1:08:04.980 --> 1:08:07.420
 is the experience we shared.

1:08:07.420 --> 1:08:10.460
 What I don't remember well is the detailed labels

1:08:10.460 --> 1:08:12.100
 of those experiences.

1:08:12.100 --> 1:08:14.100
 And I need to certainly work on that.

1:08:14.100 --> 1:08:15.060
 I don't know.

1:08:15.060 --> 1:08:19.300
 I think it's just allowing yourself to be innate

1:08:19.300 --> 1:08:22.700
 and who you are is also a beautiful thing too.

1:08:22.700 --> 1:08:24.580
 I'm not suggesting it's not important

1:08:24.580 --> 1:08:26.900
 to try and better oneself.

1:08:26.900 --> 1:08:29.780
 But I also sometimes worry about the misery

1:08:29.780 --> 1:08:31.060
 that that puts us in.

1:08:31.060 --> 1:08:35.940
 But like you, I do struggle with name,

1:08:35.940 --> 1:08:39.900
 but I know the first time when we met in the lobby,

1:08:40.740 --> 1:08:43.660
 I know exactly what you look like.

1:08:43.660 --> 1:08:45.220
 I know that you were wearing headphones.

1:08:45.220 --> 1:08:47.580
 I know the shape and the size of those headphones.

1:08:47.580 --> 1:08:49.020
 You didn't have your black jacket on.

1:08:49.020 --> 1:08:51.620
 I know exactly what the weave of your shirt looked like

1:08:51.620 --> 1:08:53.660
 and what your shoes look like.

1:08:53.660 --> 1:08:56.020
 And I knew exactly the height of your,

1:08:56.020 --> 1:08:59.540
 the end of your pants from the top of your shoes.

1:08:59.540 --> 1:09:02.060
 And so those things I don't forget.

1:09:02.060 --> 1:09:04.740
 And I can remember when people,

1:09:04.740 --> 1:09:06.940
 I met people two years ago and I'll say,

1:09:06.940 --> 1:09:08.300
 oh yes, we met there.

1:09:08.300 --> 1:09:12.300
 And I remember you had those fantastic boots on.

1:09:12.300 --> 1:09:14.700
 I thought they were pretty great pair of boots.

1:09:14.700 --> 1:09:15.940
 And they're like, how do you,

1:09:15.940 --> 1:09:18.580
 I didn't even remember what I was wearing that day.

1:09:18.580 --> 1:09:19.740
 It's fascinating.

1:09:19.740 --> 1:09:21.060
 Yeah, I'm the exact same way,

1:09:21.060 --> 1:09:23.500
 but you can't, until we have Neuralink

1:09:23.500 --> 1:09:24.340
 or something like that,

1:09:24.340 --> 1:09:26.340
 we can't communicate that you remember all those things.

1:09:26.340 --> 1:09:27.940
 I know, that's what I wanted.

1:09:27.940 --> 1:09:29.820
 So you have to be able to use tricks

1:09:29.820 --> 1:09:31.420
 of human communication for that.

1:09:31.420 --> 1:09:33.660
 But so that, I mean, that's the,

1:09:33.660 --> 1:09:35.740
 it's ultimately is a trick of like,

1:09:35.740 --> 1:09:37.940
 which to remember, which to forget.

1:09:37.940 --> 1:09:41.060
 And the forgetting is so, it's so fascinating to say this.

1:09:41.060 --> 1:09:44.500
 I mean, it seems to be deeply connected

1:09:44.500 --> 1:09:46.660
 to that assimilation process.

1:09:46.660 --> 1:09:50.620
 So forgetting, you try to fit all the new stuff

1:09:50.620 --> 1:09:55.020
 into this big web of the old stuff

1:09:55.020 --> 1:09:58.220
 and the things that don't fit, you throw out.

1:09:58.220 --> 1:10:00.020
 I think the assimilation,

1:10:00.020 --> 1:10:02.060
 the way I've been thinking about it with sleep

1:10:02.060 --> 1:10:03.660
 and it's particularly sort of dream sleep

1:10:03.660 --> 1:10:06.140
 that we think can help with this assimilation

1:10:07.300 --> 1:10:09.580
 is that during wake,

1:10:09.580 --> 1:10:13.540
 we have one version of associative processing.

1:10:13.540 --> 1:10:14.380
 And what I mean by that

1:10:14.380 --> 1:10:17.140
 is we see the most obvious connections.

1:10:17.140 --> 1:10:22.140
 So I think of wakefulness as a Google search gone right.

1:10:22.140 --> 1:10:27.140
 Whereas I see dream sleep as doing something very different.

1:10:27.140 --> 1:10:28.500
 I think dream sleep is a little bit

1:10:28.500 --> 1:10:31.100
 like group therapy for memories

1:10:31.100 --> 1:10:33.500
 that everyone gets a name badge

1:10:33.500 --> 1:10:36.660
 and sleep gathers in all of the individual pieces

1:10:36.660 --> 1:10:39.620
 of the day and it sort of starts to get you

1:10:39.620 --> 1:10:42.140
 to forces you, in fact, to speak to the people,

1:10:42.140 --> 1:10:43.180
 not at the front of the room

1:10:43.180 --> 1:10:45.580
 that you think you've got the most obvious connection with,

1:10:45.580 --> 1:10:47.220
 but to speak with the people all the way

1:10:47.220 --> 1:10:48.860
 at the back of the room that at first you think,

1:10:48.860 --> 1:10:51.140
 I've got no idea what's going on in the room.

1:10:51.140 --> 1:10:54.500
 You think I've got no obvious connection with them at all.

1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:56.620
 But once you get chatting with them,

1:10:56.620 --> 1:10:58.780
 you learn that you do have a very distant,

1:10:58.780 --> 1:10:59.980
 non obvious connection,

1:10:59.980 --> 1:11:02.740
 but it's still a connection on the same.

1:11:02.740 --> 1:11:05.300
 And it's almost as though you're doing a Google search

1:11:05.300 --> 1:11:08.700
 where I input Lex Friedman

1:11:08.700 --> 1:11:12.140
 and it doesn't take me to the first page of your home site.

1:11:12.140 --> 1:11:13.900
 It takes me to page 20,

1:11:13.900 --> 1:11:16.980
 which is about some like field hockey game in Utah.

1:11:16.980 --> 1:11:19.620
 It turns out that there actually is a link.

1:11:19.620 --> 1:11:22.340
 If I look at it, it's a distant, non obvious one.

1:11:22.340 --> 1:11:24.180
 And to me, I find that exciting

1:11:24.180 --> 1:11:25.860
 because when you fuse things together

1:11:25.860 --> 1:11:27.780
 that shouldn't normally go together,

1:11:27.780 --> 1:11:30.100
 but when they do, they cause marked advances

1:11:30.100 --> 1:11:31.580
 in evolutionary fitness.

1:11:31.580 --> 1:11:34.940
 It sounds like the biological basis of creativity.

1:11:34.940 --> 1:11:37.500
 And that's exactly what I think dream sleep

1:11:37.500 --> 1:11:40.620
 and the algorithm of dream sleep is designed to do.

1:11:40.620 --> 1:11:44.100
 It's not a Boolean like system where you have

1:11:45.060 --> 1:11:49.220
 the sort of assumptions of true and false.

1:11:49.220 --> 1:11:52.020
 Maybe it's more fuzzy logic system.

1:11:52.020 --> 1:11:55.140
 And I think REM sleep is a perfect environment

1:11:55.140 --> 1:11:58.940
 within which we do, it's almost like memory pinball.

1:11:58.940 --> 1:12:02.100
 You get the information that you've learned during the day

1:12:02.100 --> 1:12:03.460
 and then you pull the lever back

1:12:03.460 --> 1:12:07.300
 and you shoot it up into the attic of your brain,

1:12:07.300 --> 1:12:09.020
 this cortex filled with all

1:12:09.020 --> 1:12:11.300
 of your past historical knowledge.

1:12:11.300 --> 1:12:12.660
 And you start to bounce it around

1:12:12.660 --> 1:12:14.540
 and see where one of those things lights up

1:12:14.540 --> 1:12:15.780
 and you build a new connection there

1:12:15.780 --> 1:12:17.500
 and you build another one there too.

1:12:17.500 --> 1:12:19.780
 You're developing schemas.

1:12:19.780 --> 1:12:22.340
 And so in that way, I think you could argue,

1:12:23.420 --> 1:12:25.540
 we dream, therefore we are.

1:12:27.060 --> 1:12:31.140
 Yeah, so in terms of this line between learning

1:12:31.140 --> 1:12:33.780
 and thinking through a new thing

1:12:33.780 --> 1:12:36.460
 that seems to be deeply connected,

1:12:36.460 --> 1:12:40.980
 there's this legendary engineer named Jim Keller

1:12:40.980 --> 1:12:42.780
 who keeps yelling at me about this.

1:12:42.780 --> 1:12:44.740
 He says it's very effective.

1:12:44.740 --> 1:12:49.340
 He likes to, for difficult problems before bed,

1:12:49.340 --> 1:12:51.100
 think about that difficult problem.

1:12:51.100 --> 1:12:52.900
 We're not talking about like drama at work

1:12:52.900 --> 1:12:54.020
 or all that kind of stuff.

1:12:54.020 --> 1:12:57.900
 No, like a scientific for him engineering problem.

1:12:57.900 --> 1:13:01.460
 He likes to like intensely think about it

1:13:01.460 --> 1:13:05.740
 to prime his mind before sleep and then go to sleep.

1:13:05.740 --> 1:13:09.740
 And then he finds that the next day,

1:13:09.740 --> 1:13:12.020
 he's able to think much clearer

1:13:12.020 --> 1:13:13.380
 and there's new ideas that come,

1:13:13.380 --> 1:13:16.820
 but also just, I guess it's more well integrated.

1:13:17.980 --> 1:13:21.500
 And sometimes during the process of like,

1:13:21.500 --> 1:13:26.500
 he's able to like wake up and like see new insights.

1:13:26.980 --> 1:13:27.820
 That's right.

1:13:27.820 --> 1:13:30.820
 If he's deeply sort of aggressively thinking through a problem.

1:13:30.820 --> 1:13:35.300
 And there's many scientific demonstrations of this.

1:13:35.300 --> 1:13:39.500
 The Mendeleev with the periodic table of elements,

1:13:39.500 --> 1:13:42.260
 he was trying for months to understand.

1:13:42.260 --> 1:13:45.860
 I mean, talk about an ecumenical problem

1:13:45.860 --> 1:13:47.940
 of epic proportions.

1:13:47.940 --> 1:13:49.980
 Here's your question today.

1:13:49.980 --> 1:13:52.940
 You have to understand how all of the known elements

1:13:52.940 --> 1:13:55.660
 in the universe fit together in a logical way.

1:13:55.660 --> 1:13:57.140
 Good luck, take care.

1:13:57.140 --> 1:13:58.900
 It was non trivial at the time.

1:13:58.900 --> 1:14:01.700
 And he would try and try, he was so obsessed with it.

1:14:01.700 --> 1:14:03.980
 He created playing cards

1:14:03.980 --> 1:14:06.620
 with all of the different elements on.

1:14:06.620 --> 1:14:09.340
 And then he would go on these long train journeys

1:14:09.340 --> 1:14:12.740
 around Europe and he would just sort of deal these cards

1:14:12.740 --> 1:14:15.180
 in front of them and he would shuffle them,

1:14:15.180 --> 1:14:16.180
 shuffling and shuffling.

1:14:16.180 --> 1:14:17.620
 And he would just try to see

1:14:17.620 --> 1:14:20.420
 if he could find what the answer was.

1:14:20.420 --> 1:14:22.660
 And then, so the story goes,

1:14:22.660 --> 1:14:25.180
 he fell asleep and he had a dream.

1:14:25.180 --> 1:14:26.740
 And in that dream,

1:14:26.740 --> 1:14:30.460
 all of these elements started to dance and play around

1:14:30.460 --> 1:14:33.140
 and they snapped into a logical grid,

1:14:33.140 --> 1:14:35.700
 atomic weights, et cetera, et cetera.

1:14:35.700 --> 1:14:39.020
 And it wasn't his waking brain

1:14:39.020 --> 1:14:41.340
 that solved the problem.

1:14:41.340 --> 1:14:42.580
 It was his sleeping brain

1:14:42.580 --> 1:14:44.580
 that solved the impenetrable problem

1:14:44.580 --> 1:14:46.980
 that his waking brain could not.

1:14:46.980 --> 1:14:48.540
 And there's been count,

1:14:48.540 --> 1:14:51.140
 even in the arts and in music,

1:14:51.140 --> 1:14:52.780
 some wonderful dreams,

1:14:52.780 --> 1:14:56.100
 Frankenstein, Mary Shelley's epic Gothic novel

1:14:56.100 --> 1:14:59.220
 came to her in a dream at Lord Byron's home.

1:15:00.460 --> 1:15:01.860
 And then we've got,

1:15:03.580 --> 1:15:04.500
 Paul McCartney.

1:15:06.060 --> 1:15:08.540
 Yesterday, the song came to him in a dream.

1:15:08.540 --> 1:15:12.780
 He was filming, gosh, what was the movie?

1:15:12.780 --> 1:15:13.860
 I don't recall it.

1:15:13.860 --> 1:15:16.260
 I should be shocked because I'm from Liverpool myself.

1:15:16.260 --> 1:15:21.260
 And, but he was on Wimpole Street in London and filming.

1:15:21.340 --> 1:15:24.580
 And he came up with that song,

1:15:24.580 --> 1:15:26.740
 the melody in his sleep,

1:15:26.740 --> 1:15:28.660
 not to be outdone by the Beatles.

1:15:28.660 --> 1:15:30.540
 And by the way, Let It Be

1:15:30.540 --> 1:15:34.500
 also came from a dream that McCartney had.

1:15:34.500 --> 1:15:38.500
 People usually give it religious overtones.

1:15:38.500 --> 1:15:41.140
 Mother Mary comes to me speaking words of wisdom,

1:15:41.140 --> 1:15:41.980
 let it be.

1:15:42.900 --> 1:15:45.460
 If you've ever asked who Mother Mary is,

1:15:45.460 --> 1:15:49.420
 it's not the biblical content.

1:15:49.420 --> 1:15:51.260
 It's his mother.

1:15:51.260 --> 1:15:54.300
 It's Mary McCartney.

1:15:54.300 --> 1:15:57.900
 And she came to him in a dream and gifted him the song.

1:15:57.900 --> 1:16:00.060
 But the best story I've heard

1:16:00.060 --> 1:16:03.260
 is not to be outdone by the Beatles.

1:16:03.260 --> 1:16:07.500
 The Stones, Keith Richards,

1:16:07.500 --> 1:16:10.260
 who I think once was suggested it.

1:16:10.260 --> 1:16:11.100
 Who was it?

1:16:11.100 --> 1:16:13.780
 It was a comedian who was saying that

1:16:13.780 --> 1:16:15.860
 in an interview with Rolling Stone,

1:16:15.860 --> 1:16:17.820
 Keith Richards suggested or inferred

1:16:17.820 --> 1:16:20.740
 that young kids should not do drugs.

1:16:20.740 --> 1:16:22.980
 And they said, well, look,

1:16:24.700 --> 1:16:26.100
 young kids can't do drugs

1:16:26.100 --> 1:16:27.780
 because you've done all of the drugs.

1:16:27.780 --> 1:16:29.820
 And I always thought that,

1:16:29.820 --> 1:16:34.380
 but Keith Richards described he would always go to bed

1:16:34.380 --> 1:16:38.540
 with his guitar and a tape recorder.

1:16:39.780 --> 1:16:42.580
 And then probably who would have a whole set

1:16:42.580 --> 1:16:43.900
 of other things in the bed with him.

1:16:43.900 --> 1:16:47.420
 And who knows how many other people, but anyway.

1:16:47.420 --> 1:16:49.780
 And then he said in his autobiography,

1:16:49.780 --> 1:16:51.100
 and I'm paraphrasing here,

1:16:51.100 --> 1:16:55.180
 but one morning I woke up and I realized

1:16:55.180 --> 1:16:58.620
 that the tape had recorded all the way to the end.

1:16:58.620 --> 1:17:02.780
 So I rewound the tape and I hit play.

1:17:02.780 --> 1:17:05.980
 And there in some kind of ghostly form

1:17:05.980 --> 1:17:08.860
 were the opening chords to Satisfaction,

1:17:08.860 --> 1:17:11.260
 the most famous successful Rolling Stone song

1:17:11.260 --> 1:17:12.500
 of all time.

1:17:13.700 --> 1:17:16.220
 Followed by then 43 minutes of snoring.

1:17:18.060 --> 1:17:19.060
 That's awesome.

1:17:19.060 --> 1:17:20.460
 That riff came to him.

1:17:20.460 --> 1:17:22.900
 One of the most famous riffs in all of rock and roll

1:17:22.900 --> 1:17:25.460
 came to him by way of a dream inspired insight.

1:17:25.460 --> 1:17:30.340
 So I think there is too many of those anecdotes.

1:17:30.340 --> 1:17:31.420
 And we've now got the side,

1:17:31.420 --> 1:17:33.940
 I don't rely on anecdotes as science.

1:17:33.940 --> 1:17:35.820
 We've now done the studies in the laboratory

1:17:35.820 --> 1:17:37.580
 and we can reliably demonstrate

1:17:37.580 --> 1:17:39.340
 that sleep inspires creativity,

1:17:39.340 --> 1:17:41.820
 inspires problem solving capacity.

1:17:41.820 --> 1:17:43.100
 Well, the interesting thing is,

1:17:43.100 --> 1:17:45.780
 is it possible to some of the ideas that you talk about

1:17:45.780 --> 1:17:47.300
 to turn them into a protocol

1:17:47.300 --> 1:17:48.940
 that could be practiced rigorously?

1:17:48.940 --> 1:17:53.380
 So what Jim Keller espouses is saying,

1:17:53.380 --> 1:17:56.860
 not just the fact that sleep helps you

1:17:56.860 --> 1:17:58.620
 increase the creativity,

1:17:58.620 --> 1:18:00.460
 but turn it into a process.

1:18:00.460 --> 1:18:03.940
 Like literally, like don't do it accidentally.

1:18:06.420 --> 1:18:08.700
 Like an athlete does certain things

1:18:08.700 --> 1:18:10.180
 to optimize their performance.

1:18:10.180 --> 1:18:11.460
 They have a training routine.

1:18:11.460 --> 1:18:16.460
 They have a regimen of like cycling and sprints

1:18:17.140 --> 1:18:18.620
 and long distance stuff.

1:18:18.620 --> 1:18:22.380
 In the same way, thinking about your job

1:18:22.380 --> 1:18:25.300
 as an idea generator in the engineering space

1:18:25.300 --> 1:18:27.620
 is like, this is good for my performance.

1:18:27.620 --> 1:18:29.860
 So like for an hour before bed,

1:18:29.860 --> 1:18:32.220
 think through a problem like every night

1:18:32.220 --> 1:18:36.700
 and then use sleep to work through that problem.

1:18:36.700 --> 1:18:39.220
 I mean, he's the first person that I heard

1:18:39.220 --> 1:18:42.700
 like of the people I really respect that do like what I do,

1:18:42.700 --> 1:18:46.260
 which is like programming engineering type work,

1:18:46.260 --> 1:18:50.780
 like using sleep, not accidentally, but with a purpose,

1:18:50.780 --> 1:18:53.020
 like using sleep.

1:18:53.020 --> 1:18:54.900
 That's just basically the difference between,

1:18:54.900 --> 1:18:57.540
 as you said, a passive approach to it

1:18:57.540 --> 1:19:01.900
 versus an active deterministic

1:19:01.900 --> 1:19:04.020
 or hope for a deterministic approach to it.

1:19:04.020 --> 1:19:08.460
 In other words, that you are actually trying to harness

1:19:08.460 --> 1:19:11.380
 the power of sleep in a deliberate way

1:19:11.380 --> 1:19:13.980
 rather than an unthoughtful way.

1:19:13.980 --> 1:19:17.580
 I still think that mother nature through it,

1:19:17.580 --> 1:19:20.260
 the 3.6 million years of evolution

1:19:20.260 --> 1:19:22.580
 has probably got it mostly figured out

1:19:22.580 --> 1:19:25.980
 in terms of what information should be uploaded at night

1:19:25.980 --> 1:19:27.140
 and worked through.

1:19:27.140 --> 1:19:31.300
 I think her algorithm is probably pretty good at this stage.

1:19:31.300 --> 1:19:32.420
 It's not to suggest though,

1:19:32.420 --> 1:19:35.820
 that we can't try to tweak it and nudge it.

1:19:35.820 --> 1:19:39.020
 It's a very light hand on the tiller is what he's doing.

1:19:39.020 --> 1:19:41.900
 I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

1:19:41.900 --> 1:19:43.500
 Just like, for example, for me,

1:19:43.500 --> 1:19:47.420
 fasting has improved my ability to focus deeply

1:19:47.420 --> 1:19:49.740
 and productivity significantly.

1:19:49.740 --> 1:19:51.500
 And in that same way,

1:19:52.620 --> 1:19:55.500
 it's possible that playing with these ideas

1:19:55.500 --> 1:19:57.940
 of thinking before bed or some hours before bed

1:19:57.940 --> 1:20:00.300
 or some playing with different protocols

1:20:00.300 --> 1:20:02.020
 will have a significant leap

1:20:02.020 --> 1:20:04.300
 over what mother nature naturally does.

1:20:04.300 --> 1:20:06.700
 So if you let your body do what it naturally does,

1:20:06.700 --> 1:20:09.380
 you may not achieve the same level of performance

1:20:09.380 --> 1:20:12.980
 because mother nature has not designed us

1:20:12.980 --> 1:20:16.460
 to think deeply about chip design

1:20:16.460 --> 1:20:20.540
 or programming artificial intelligence systems.

1:20:20.540 --> 1:20:23.140
 Well, she's gifted us the architecture

1:20:23.140 --> 1:20:25.580
 and the capacity to do that.

1:20:25.580 --> 1:20:30.580
 What we do with that is what life's experience dictates.

1:20:31.500 --> 1:20:34.460
 She gives us the blueprint to do many.

1:20:34.460 --> 1:20:37.340
 Well, if I were to sort of introspect

1:20:37.340 --> 1:20:39.900
 and self analyze what mother nature wants me to do,

1:20:39.900 --> 1:20:42.780
 I think given my current lifestyle

1:20:42.780 --> 1:20:45.220
 that I have food in the fridge

1:20:45.220 --> 1:20:47.180
 and a bed to sleep on,

1:20:47.180 --> 1:20:50.140
 I think what mother nature wants me to do is to be lazy.

1:20:51.300 --> 1:20:54.700
 And so I think I'm actually resisting mother nature

1:20:56.620 --> 1:20:59.580
 because so many of my needs are satisfied.

1:20:59.580 --> 1:21:04.220
 And so I have to resist some of the natural forces

1:21:04.220 --> 1:21:05.780
 of the body and the mind

1:21:05.780 --> 1:21:07.820
 when I do some of the things I do.

1:21:07.820 --> 1:21:09.420
 So there's that dance,

1:21:10.500 --> 1:21:12.780
 like I've been thinking about doing a startup

1:21:12.780 --> 1:21:15.220
 and that's obviously going against everything

1:21:15.220 --> 1:21:18.020
 that my body and mind are telling me to do

1:21:18.020 --> 1:21:21.180
 because it's going to be basically suffering.

1:21:21.180 --> 1:21:22.660
 But the only reason I want...

1:21:22.660 --> 1:21:24.660
 As you know, it will be over.

1:21:24.660 --> 1:21:29.260
 Yes, but nevertheless,

1:21:29.260 --> 1:21:31.940
 there's some kind of inner drive that wants me to do it.

1:21:31.940 --> 1:21:33.700
 And then you start to ask a question,

1:21:33.700 --> 1:21:36.460
 well, how do you optimize the things you can't optimize

1:21:36.460 --> 1:21:38.060
 like sleep, like diet,

1:21:38.060 --> 1:21:40.300
 like the people that you surround yourself with

1:21:40.300 --> 1:21:43.500
 in order to maximize happiness and performance

1:21:43.500 --> 1:21:47.020
 and all those kinds of things without also over optimizing.

1:21:47.020 --> 1:21:52.020
 And that's such an interesting idea from a engineer.

1:21:52.780 --> 1:21:55.460
 So as you may know,

1:21:55.460 --> 1:21:59.540
 you don't often get those kinds of ideas from engineers.

1:21:59.540 --> 1:22:04.020
 Engineers usually just don't read books about sleeping.

1:22:04.020 --> 1:22:06.100
 They're usually like the...

1:22:06.100 --> 1:22:10.340
 They're not the healthiest of people.

1:22:11.460 --> 1:22:13.060
 I think that's changing over time,

1:22:13.060 --> 1:22:14.060
 especially with Silicon Valley,

1:22:14.060 --> 1:22:15.460
 especially with the tech sector.

1:22:15.460 --> 1:22:18.260
 People are starting to understand what's a healthy lifestyle,

1:22:18.260 --> 1:22:20.980
 but usually they're kind of on the insane side,

1:22:20.980 --> 1:22:22.660
 especially programmers.

1:22:22.660 --> 1:22:27.420
 But it's nice to hear somebody like that use sleep

1:22:27.420 --> 1:22:29.380
 and use some of the things that you talk about

1:22:29.380 --> 1:22:33.220
 strategically on purpose.

1:22:33.220 --> 1:22:36.860
 When I get to that idea of not just trying to use

1:22:36.860 --> 1:22:38.980
 what Mother Nature gave,

1:22:38.980 --> 1:22:43.980
 but seeing if you can do something more or different,

1:22:45.940 --> 1:22:47.940
 in a conservative mindset,

1:22:49.180 --> 1:22:52.500
 I would then pose the question at what cost?

1:22:52.500 --> 1:22:55.660
 Because when you do something perhaps

1:22:55.660 --> 1:22:59.060
 that deviates from the typical pre programmed,

1:22:59.060 --> 1:23:02.420
 you know, Mother Nature's program,

1:23:04.100 --> 1:23:07.860
 I suspect it usually comes at the cost of something else.

1:23:07.860 --> 1:23:12.420
 So maybe he is able to direct and focus

1:23:12.420 --> 1:23:16.540
 his sleeping cognition on those particular topics

1:23:16.540 --> 1:23:20.300
 that will gain him better problematic resolution

1:23:20.300 --> 1:23:22.220
 the next day when he wakes up.

1:23:22.220 --> 1:23:23.300
 The question is though,

1:23:23.300 --> 1:23:26.300
 at what cost of the other things that didn't make it

1:23:26.300 --> 1:23:31.300
 onto the menu of the finger buffet of sleep that night?

1:23:31.980 --> 1:23:34.340
 And is it that you don't process

1:23:34.340 --> 1:23:37.540
 the emotional difficulties or events,

1:23:37.540 --> 1:23:41.140
 and therefore you are less emotionally resolved the next day,

1:23:41.140 --> 1:23:45.340
 but you are more problem resolved the following day.

1:23:45.340 --> 1:23:46.940
 And so I always try to think,

1:23:46.940 --> 1:23:51.660
 and I truly don't want to sound puritanical

1:23:51.660 --> 1:23:52.740
 either about sleep,

1:23:52.740 --> 1:23:56.220
 and I think I've come off that way many a times,

1:23:56.220 --> 1:23:58.580
 especially when I started out in the public.

1:24:00.100 --> 1:24:02.300
 The tone of the book, in some ways,

1:24:02.300 --> 1:24:06.300
 I look back and think, could I have been a little softer?

1:24:06.300 --> 1:24:10.580
 And the reason was I was that way back in

1:24:10.580 --> 1:24:11.660
 when I started writing the book,

1:24:11.660 --> 1:24:15.340
 which was probably something like 2014 or 15,

1:24:16.500 --> 1:24:18.620
 sleep was the neglected stepsister

1:24:18.620 --> 1:24:21.460
 in the health conversation of the day.

1:24:21.460 --> 1:24:25.300
 And I was just so sad to see the amount of suffering

1:24:25.300 --> 1:24:27.420
 and disease and sickness that was caused

1:24:27.420 --> 1:24:29.580
 by insufficient sleep.

1:24:29.580 --> 1:24:33.060
 And for years before I'd been doing public speaking,

1:24:33.060 --> 1:24:34.980
 and I'd tell people about the great things

1:24:34.980 --> 1:24:36.260
 that happen when you get sleep.

1:24:36.260 --> 1:24:37.900
 People would say, that's fascinating.

1:24:37.900 --> 1:24:39.980
 And then they would go back and keep doing the same thing

1:24:39.980 --> 1:24:41.740
 about not sleeping enough.

1:24:41.740 --> 1:24:43.700
 And then I realized you can't really speak

1:24:43.700 --> 1:24:44.820
 about the good things that happen.

1:24:44.820 --> 1:24:46.980
 It's like the news, what bleeds leads.

1:24:46.980 --> 1:24:49.300
 And if you speak about the alarmingly bad things

1:24:49.300 --> 1:24:52.980
 that happen, people tend to have a behavioral change.

1:24:52.980 --> 1:24:55.380
 And so the book as a consequence,

1:24:55.380 --> 1:24:59.860
 I think probably came out a little bit on the strong side

1:24:59.860 --> 1:25:03.620
 of trying to convince people.

1:25:03.620 --> 1:25:05.060
 Well, you were trying to help a lot of people

1:25:05.060 --> 1:25:07.740
 and that's a powerful way to help a lot of people.

1:25:07.740 --> 1:25:09.500
 I was genuinely trying to help people,

1:25:09.500 --> 1:25:12.100
 but certainly for some people for whom sleep

1:25:12.100 --> 1:25:14.620
 does not come easy, then it was probably

1:25:15.940 --> 1:25:17.500
 a tricky book to read too.

1:25:17.500 --> 1:25:20.660
 And I think I feel more sensitive to those people now

1:25:20.660 --> 1:25:23.060
 and empathetically connected to them.

1:25:23.060 --> 1:25:27.660
 So I think the, again, the point was simply

1:25:27.660 --> 1:25:32.580
 that I don't mean to sound too puritanical in all of this.

1:25:32.580 --> 1:25:36.900
 And the same way with caffeine and coffee.

1:25:36.900 --> 1:25:40.780
 I am just a scientist and I am not here to tell anyone

1:25:40.780 --> 1:25:41.980
 how to live their life.

1:25:41.980 --> 1:25:44.020
 That is not my job at all.

1:25:44.020 --> 1:25:47.180
 And life is to be lived to a degree

1:25:47.180 --> 1:25:51.500
 and life is to be lived if you want to do a startup.

1:25:51.500 --> 1:25:54.060
 All I want to do is empower people

1:25:54.060 --> 1:25:57.500
 with the understanding of the science of sleep.

1:25:57.500 --> 1:25:59.340
 And then you can make an informed choice

1:25:59.340 --> 1:26:00.980
 as to how you want to live your life.

1:26:00.980 --> 1:26:03.580
 And I offer no judgment on how anyone

1:26:03.580 --> 1:26:05.500
 wishes to live their life.

1:26:05.500 --> 1:26:08.580
 I just want to try and see if the information

1:26:08.580 --> 1:26:12.060
 that I have about sleep would alternatively change

1:26:12.060 --> 1:26:13.740
 how you would think about your life decisions.

1:26:13.740 --> 1:26:15.460
 And if it doesn't, no problem.

1:26:15.460 --> 1:26:18.300
 And if it does, I hope it's been of use.

1:26:18.300 --> 1:26:20.620
 Well, maybe this is me trying

1:26:20.620 --> 1:26:22.900
 to justify my lifestyle to you.

1:26:22.900 --> 1:26:27.460
 But Dr. Seuss said, you know you're in love

1:26:27.460 --> 1:26:29.620
 when you can't fall asleep because reality

1:26:29.620 --> 1:26:31.820
 is finally better than your dreams.

1:26:32.740 --> 1:26:34.540
 I love that quote too.

1:26:34.540 --> 1:26:35.380
 Okay.

1:26:37.460 --> 1:26:41.980
 My sleeping schedule is complicated

1:26:41.980 --> 1:26:45.980
 and it has to do primarily with the fact

1:26:45.980 --> 1:26:49.580
 that I love basically everything that I do.

1:26:49.580 --> 1:26:53.540
 And that love takes a form that may not appear

1:26:53.540 --> 1:26:56.660
 to be love from the external observer perspective.

1:26:56.660 --> 1:26:58.780
 Cause it's often includes struggle.

1:26:58.780 --> 1:27:02.180
 It often includes something that looks like stress

1:27:02.180 --> 1:27:03.780
 even though it's not stress.

1:27:03.780 --> 1:27:06.940
 It's like this excitement, it's this turmoil

1:27:06.940 --> 1:27:11.180
 and chaos of passion, of struggling with a problem

1:27:11.180 --> 1:27:15.940
 of being sad and down to the point even depressed

1:27:15.940 --> 1:27:18.620
 of how difficult the problem is, the disappointment

1:27:18.620 --> 1:27:22.060
 that the last few weeks and months have been a failure

1:27:22.060 --> 1:27:25.300
 and self doubt, all that mix.

1:27:25.300 --> 1:27:27.140
 But I love it.

1:27:27.140 --> 1:27:30.340
 And a part of that is sometimes staying up all night

1:27:30.340 --> 1:27:33.220
 working on a thing I'm really passionate about.

1:27:33.220 --> 1:27:36.460
 And that means sleep schedules that are just like,

1:27:37.500 --> 1:27:39.860
 you know, sometimes sleeping during the day,

1:27:39.860 --> 1:27:43.220
 sometimes very often sleeping very little

1:27:43.220 --> 1:27:46.740
 but taking naps that are like an hour, two hours and so on.

1:27:46.740 --> 1:27:48.620
 That kind of weird chaos.

1:27:48.620 --> 1:27:53.620
 And now I'll also try to give myself back up.

1:27:54.220 --> 1:27:56.180
 I was trying to like research yesterday

1:27:56.180 --> 1:27:59.660
 is anybody else productive, wild like this?

1:27:59.660 --> 1:28:02.140
 And there's of course a lot of anecdotal evidence

1:28:02.140 --> 1:28:05.820
 and some of it could be just narratives

1:28:05.820 --> 1:28:07.780
 that people have told to the public

1:28:07.780 --> 1:28:09.860
 when in reality they sleep way more.

1:28:09.860 --> 1:28:14.860
 But there's a bunch of people that are famous

1:28:14.940 --> 1:28:16.340
 for not sleeping much.

1:28:16.340 --> 1:28:21.340
 So on the topic of naps, I read this a long time ago

1:28:21.620 --> 1:28:26.300
 and I checked this, Churchill was big on big naps.

1:28:26.300 --> 1:28:28.540
 And is actually just reading more

1:28:28.540 --> 1:28:31.300
 about Winston Churchill's sleep schedule

1:28:31.300 --> 1:28:33.020
 is very much like mine.

1:28:33.020 --> 1:28:36.900
 So I basically wanna give myself the opportunity

1:28:36.900 --> 1:28:40.740
 to at night to stay up all night if I want to.

1:28:40.740 --> 1:28:44.780
 And a good nap is a big part of that in the late evening.

1:28:44.780 --> 1:28:48.060
 Like I'll often, this destroys social life completely

1:28:48.060 --> 1:28:51.980
 but I'll often take a nap in the late afternoon

1:28:51.980 --> 1:28:54.020
 or the evening and that sets me

1:28:54.020 --> 1:28:56.540
 if I want to stay up all night.

1:28:56.540 --> 1:29:00.620
 And things like that, that I read that Nikola Tesla

1:29:00.620 --> 1:29:05.140
 slept only two hours a night, Edison the same three hours

1:29:05.140 --> 1:29:07.700
 but he actually did the polyphasic sleep

1:29:07.700 --> 1:29:10.260
 like where it's just a bunch of naps.

1:29:10.260 --> 1:29:15.260
 What can you say about this madness of love

1:29:15.860 --> 1:29:18.900
 and passion of loving everything you do

1:29:18.900 --> 1:29:22.220
 and the chaos of sleep that might result in?

1:29:23.380 --> 1:29:28.380
 I love the Seuss quote and I've had that experience too.

1:29:28.740 --> 1:29:33.100
 Like you, I adore what I do.

1:29:33.100 --> 1:29:37.700
 If someone gave you enough money

1:29:37.700 --> 1:29:40.260
 to live the rest of your life,

1:29:40.260 --> 1:29:43.260
 got a roof above my head, rice and beans on the table

1:29:43.260 --> 1:29:45.260
 and they said, you don't have to work anymore.

1:29:45.260 --> 1:29:46.900
 I would do nothing different.

1:29:46.900 --> 1:29:51.900
 I would do exactly, this sounds a little crass

1:29:51.940 --> 1:29:53.820
 and I hope it doesn't sound this way

1:29:53.820 --> 1:30:03.180
 but being a scientist is not what I do, it's who I am.

1:30:03.180 --> 1:30:08.180
 And when that's the case, sleep, working out,

1:30:09.260 --> 1:30:12.460
 showering and eating are the things that I do

1:30:12.460 --> 1:30:17.540
 in between my love affair with sleep.

1:30:17.540 --> 1:30:19.380
 I fell for sleep like a blind roofer.

1:30:19.380 --> 1:30:24.380
 And it was a love affair that started 20 years ago

1:30:28.300 --> 1:30:33.100
 and I remain utterly besotted today.

1:30:33.100 --> 1:30:37.420
 It's the most beguiling thing in the world to me.

1:30:37.420 --> 1:30:41.540
 And I could easily and I have, it's kept me up at night.

1:30:41.540 --> 1:30:44.140
 When my mind is fizzing with experimental ideas

1:30:44.140 --> 1:30:47.380
 or I think I've got a new hypothesis or theory,

1:30:47.380 --> 1:30:49.140
 I will struggle with sleep.

1:30:49.140 --> 1:30:52.300
 I really will, it doesn't come easy to me

1:30:52.300 --> 1:30:56.500
 because my mind is just so on fire with those ideas.

1:30:56.500 --> 1:30:58.860
 So I understand the struggle,

1:31:01.060 --> 1:31:06.060
 but I couldn't advocate from a scientific perspective,

1:31:07.140 --> 1:31:09.700
 the schedule because the science just doesn't,

1:31:11.020 --> 1:31:14.780
 I would feel as though I'm doing you a disservice

1:31:14.780 --> 1:31:19.780
 to say it's okay, that won't come with some blast radius,

1:31:20.380 --> 1:31:22.980
 some health consequences.

1:31:22.980 --> 1:31:25.500
 You can add Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan

1:31:25.500 --> 1:31:26.660
 to that list too.

1:31:26.660 --> 1:31:30.860
 Both of them were very proud chest beaters

1:31:30.860 --> 1:31:32.260
 of how little sleep that they get.

1:31:32.260 --> 1:31:34.980
 Thatcher said four hours, Reagan something similar.

1:31:35.820 --> 1:31:38.140
 And I, knowing the links that we now know

1:31:38.140 --> 1:31:39.860
 between sleep and Alzheimer's disease,

1:31:39.860 --> 1:31:42.900
 I've often wondered whether it was coincidental then

1:31:42.900 --> 1:31:46.380
 that both of them died of the terrible disease of Alzheimer's

1:31:46.380 --> 1:31:49.740
 meaning, maybe it doesn't get you by way of

1:31:49.740 --> 1:31:52.060
 being popped out of the gene pool in a car accident

1:31:52.060 --> 1:31:55.020
 because you had a microsleep at the wheel at age 32,

1:31:55.020 --> 1:31:59.700
 or it doesn't get you at 42 with heart attack

1:31:59.700 --> 1:32:03.780
 or even 52 with cancer or a stroke,

1:32:03.780 --> 1:32:05.660
 maybe it gets you in your seventies.

1:32:05.660 --> 1:32:07.740
 I think the elastic band of sleep deprivation

1:32:07.740 --> 1:32:10.740
 can stretch only so far before it snaps

1:32:10.740 --> 1:32:13.620
 and it ultimately seems to snap.

1:32:13.620 --> 1:32:18.620
 Nicola Tesla, I think he died of a coronary thrombosis,

1:32:21.700 --> 1:32:22.700
 I believe.

1:32:22.700 --> 1:32:25.380
 And there was a wonderful study done out of Harvard

1:32:25.380 --> 1:32:27.860
 where they took a group of people who had no signs

1:32:27.860 --> 1:32:30.220
 of cardiovascular disease.

1:32:30.220 --> 1:32:32.700
 And what they found is that when they track them

1:32:32.700 --> 1:32:36.380
 for years afterwards, they were completely healthy

1:32:36.380 --> 1:32:37.220
 to begin with.

1:32:37.220 --> 1:32:40.180
 Those people who are getting less than six hours of sleep

1:32:40.180 --> 1:32:43.420
 ended up having a 300% increased risk

1:32:43.420 --> 1:32:46.500
 of developing calcification of the coronary artery,

1:32:46.500 --> 1:32:51.420
 which is the major sort of corridor of life for your heart.

1:32:51.420 --> 1:32:54.820
 When someone says, he died of a massive coronary,

1:32:54.820 --> 1:32:58.380
 it's because of a blockade of the coronary artery.

1:32:58.380 --> 1:33:03.380
 And Tesla passed away from a coronary thrombosis.

1:33:03.500 --> 1:33:05.100
 We also know that insufficient sleep

1:33:05.100 --> 1:33:07.380
 is linked to numerous mental health issues.

1:33:07.380 --> 1:33:11.340
 We know that Churchill had a wicked battle with depression.

1:33:11.340 --> 1:33:13.260
 Gosh, my goodness, he used to call it black dog

1:33:13.260 --> 1:33:15.060
 that would come and visit him.

1:33:15.060 --> 1:33:16.500
 And I think many of his paintings,

1:33:16.500 --> 1:33:18.260
 he was exquisite painter,

1:33:18.260 --> 1:33:20.780
 but some of them would depict his darkness

1:33:20.780 --> 1:33:22.820
 with depression as well.

1:33:24.940 --> 1:33:26.100
 Edison is interesting.

1:33:26.100 --> 1:33:28.580
 People have argued that he would short sleep

1:33:28.580 --> 1:33:30.260
 and he didn't put much value in sleep.

1:33:30.260 --> 1:33:31.740
 Whether or not that's true, we don't know,

1:33:31.740 --> 1:33:33.140
 but he was a habitual napper.

1:33:33.140 --> 1:33:33.980
 You're right, during the day,

1:33:33.980 --> 1:33:36.340
 I've got some great pictures of him on his inventor's bench

1:33:36.340 --> 1:33:37.300
 taking a nap.

1:33:37.300 --> 1:33:41.060
 And in fact, I believe he set up nap carts around his house

1:33:41.060 --> 1:33:42.580
 so he could nap.

1:33:42.580 --> 1:33:44.700
 But what we also know, a study, again,

1:33:44.700 --> 1:33:47.820
 coming out of Harvard just a couple of months ago,

1:33:47.820 --> 1:33:50.540
 demonstrated very clearly that polyphasic sleep

1:33:50.540 --> 1:33:52.980
 is associated with worse physical outcomes,

1:33:52.980 --> 1:33:54.740
 worse cognitive outcomes,

1:33:54.740 --> 1:33:57.460
 and especially worse mood outcomes.

1:33:57.460 --> 1:33:58.900
 So from that sense,

1:33:58.900 --> 1:34:01.660
 sleeping like a baby is not perfect for adults.

1:34:01.660 --> 1:34:05.740
 So there's a fascinating dance here

1:34:05.740 --> 1:34:09.140
 of the mean and the extreme,

1:34:09.140 --> 1:34:13.220
 like the average and the high performers.

1:34:13.220 --> 1:34:14.060
 So I,

1:34:17.940 --> 1:34:21.460
 this gets to like the meaning of life kind of discussion,

1:34:21.460 --> 1:34:24.820
 but let's go that way.

1:34:24.820 --> 1:34:25.940
 And also happiness.

1:34:25.940 --> 1:34:29.540
 So when studying sleep and when studying anything

1:34:29.540 --> 1:34:31.740
 like diet and exercise,

1:34:31.740 --> 1:34:35.940
 I think you have to really get a lot more data

1:34:35.940 --> 1:34:38.020
 about individuals to make

1:34:40.620 --> 1:34:41.620
 conclusive statement.

1:34:41.620 --> 1:34:43.580
 That's when people talk about like,

1:34:43.580 --> 1:34:47.100
 is meat, red meat good for you or bad for you, right?

1:34:47.100 --> 1:34:50.700
 It's just so often correlated with other life decisions

1:34:50.700 --> 1:34:53.100
 when you choose to eat meat or not.

1:34:53.100 --> 1:34:58.100
 My sense is that whatever life decisions you make,

1:34:58.100 --> 1:35:02.620
 if they reduce stress and lead to happiness,

1:35:02.620 --> 1:35:04.860
 that's also going to be a big boost

1:35:04.860 --> 1:35:06.020
 that needs to be integrated

1:35:06.020 --> 1:35:07.940
 into the plots in the science, right?

1:35:07.940 --> 1:35:10.860
 So I'll give you an example of somebody

1:35:10.860 --> 1:35:13.900
 who is unarguably seen as unhealthy.

1:35:15.100 --> 1:35:17.340
 My friend, Mr. David Goggins.

1:35:17.340 --> 1:35:21.660
 So he's clearly, obviously,

1:35:21.660 --> 1:35:23.900
 almost on purpose destroying his body.

1:35:23.900 --> 1:35:28.540
 He's destroying his body and to say

1:35:28.540 --> 1:35:32.660
 that he's doing the wrong thing or the unhealthy thing

1:35:32.660 --> 1:35:36.300
 feels like, feels wrong.

1:35:38.140 --> 1:35:41.620
 But I'm not sure exactly in which way he feels wrong.

1:35:41.620 --> 1:35:43.740
 One of the things I'm bothered by,

1:35:43.740 --> 1:35:47.100
 and again, I apologize for the therapy sessions,

1:35:48.420 --> 1:35:49.820
 a framework of this,

1:35:49.820 --> 1:35:54.820
 but I'm bothered by the fact that a lot of people

1:35:55.820 --> 1:35:59.660
 tell me or David that they're doing things wrong.

1:36:02.220 --> 1:36:05.260
 A lot of people in my life, when they see me not sleep,

1:36:06.460 --> 1:36:09.260
 they'll tell me to sleep more.

1:36:09.260 --> 1:36:13.940
 Now they're correct, but one fundamental aspect

1:36:13.940 --> 1:36:18.300
 that I'd like to complain about is not enough people,

1:36:18.300 --> 1:36:22.420
 almost nobody, especially people that care for me,

1:36:22.420 --> 1:36:24.220
 will come to me and say,

1:36:25.820 --> 1:36:29.380
 you have a dream, work harder.

1:36:34.660 --> 1:36:39.660
 It's like the healthy thing should be a component

1:36:39.660 --> 1:36:44.420
 of a life well lived, but not everything.

1:36:44.420 --> 1:36:45.820
 And I don't know what to do with that

1:36:45.820 --> 1:36:48.420
 because you certainly don't want to espouse.

1:36:48.420 --> 1:36:51.380
 And just like you said, when you were working in your book,

1:36:51.380 --> 1:36:55.900
 there is a belief, sleep was a secondary citizen

1:36:55.900 --> 1:36:59.060
 in the full spectrum of what's a healthy life.

1:36:59.060 --> 1:37:02.340
 But at the same time, I'm bothered by in Silicon Valley

1:37:02.340 --> 1:37:05.580
 and all these kinds of work environments

1:37:05.580 --> 1:37:07.460
 that I get to work with, with engineers,

1:37:07.460 --> 1:37:12.060
 is there's to me too much focus on work life balance.

1:37:12.060 --> 1:37:16.100
 And what that usually starts meaning is like,

1:37:16.100 --> 1:37:18.500
 yeah, yeah, of course, it's good to have a social life,

1:37:18.500 --> 1:37:19.540
 it's good to have a family,

1:37:19.540 --> 1:37:23.340
 it's good to eat well and sleep well,

1:37:23.340 --> 1:37:25.460
 but we should also discover our passion.

1:37:25.460 --> 1:37:30.140
 We should also give ourselves a chance

1:37:30.140 --> 1:37:33.860
 to work our ass off towards a dream

1:37:33.860 --> 1:37:36.940
 and make mistakes and take big risks

1:37:36.940 --> 1:37:40.060
 that in the short term seem to sacrifice health.

1:37:40.060 --> 1:37:42.860
 And I think to come back to how you started

1:37:42.860 --> 1:37:45.340
 about David Goggins, who I've never met,

1:37:45.340 --> 1:37:48.180
 but who I admire incredibly

1:37:48.180 --> 1:37:50.900
 and have an immense reverence for the man.

1:37:51.780 --> 1:37:53.740
 You said two things,

1:37:53.740 --> 1:37:58.740
 is it wrong to do those things to yourself?

1:37:59.900 --> 1:38:03.700
 And is it unhealthy to do those things to yourself?

1:38:03.700 --> 1:38:07.700
 I disagree with the former and I agree with the latter.

1:38:07.700 --> 1:38:10.940
 So from a health biological medicine perspective,

1:38:12.020 --> 1:38:14.740
 sleeping in the way that you've described

1:38:14.740 --> 1:38:16.340
 or that other people may be sleeping

1:38:16.340 --> 1:38:18.100
 in terms of insufficient amounts,

1:38:19.780 --> 1:38:24.340
 now to your point too about into individual differences,

1:38:24.340 --> 1:38:27.140
 usually when I see a bar graph and a mean,

1:38:27.140 --> 1:38:30.380
 I usually say, show me your variance.

1:38:30.380 --> 1:38:32.140
 I want to see your variance.

1:38:32.140 --> 1:38:35.420
 In other words, show me the distribution of that effect.

1:38:35.420 --> 1:38:36.940
 How many people were below the mean?

1:38:36.940 --> 1:38:39.980
 How many, is it all tightly clustered around this one thing?

1:38:39.980 --> 1:38:41.620
 So it's a very robust effect

1:38:41.620 --> 1:38:44.540
 or was this huge fan of effect where for some people

1:38:44.540 --> 1:38:46.260
 there was no effect at all and other people

1:38:46.260 --> 1:38:48.980
 there was a whopping effect and everything in between.

1:38:48.980 --> 1:38:52.700
 So I don't discount into individual variability,

1:38:54.300 --> 1:38:57.060
 but, and I will come back to those two points about,

1:38:57.060 --> 1:38:59.580
 is it wrong and is it unhealthy in just a second?

1:38:59.580 --> 1:39:00.980
 When it comes to sleep,

1:39:00.980 --> 1:39:04.660
 we have found huge amounts of into individual differences

1:39:04.660 --> 1:39:07.220
 in your response to a lack of sleep.

1:39:07.220 --> 1:39:09.460
 But one of the fascinating things,

1:39:09.460 --> 1:39:10.900
 so let's say that I take you

1:39:10.900 --> 1:39:13.260
 and we're going to measure your attention,

1:39:13.260 --> 1:39:16.940
 your emotion, your mood, your blood pressure,

1:39:16.940 --> 1:39:19.180
 your blood sugar glucose regulation,

1:39:19.180 --> 1:39:20.620
 your autonomic nervous system

1:39:20.620 --> 1:39:22.380
 and your different gene expression.

1:39:22.380 --> 1:39:25.740
 Let's say I'm just going to measure a whole kaleidoscope

1:39:25.740 --> 1:39:28.740
 of different outcomes, brain and body.

1:39:28.740 --> 1:39:31.140
 And I find that on our measure of cognition

1:39:31.140 --> 1:39:33.580
 on your attentional ability to focus,

1:39:33.580 --> 1:39:35.180
 you are very resilient.

1:39:35.180 --> 1:39:37.100
 You just don't show any impairment at all

1:39:37.100 --> 1:39:39.980
 even after being awake for 36 hours straight.

1:39:40.860 --> 1:39:42.540
 Does that mean that you are resilient

1:39:42.540 --> 1:39:44.580
 in all of those other domains as well?

1:39:44.580 --> 1:39:46.380
 The answer is no, you're not.

1:39:46.380 --> 1:39:48.820
 So you can be resilient in one,

1:39:48.820 --> 1:39:51.580
 but very vulnerable in another.

1:39:51.580 --> 1:39:56.100
 And we've not found anyone who isn't at least vulnerable

1:39:56.100 --> 1:39:58.340
 in one of those domains,

1:39:58.340 --> 1:40:02.060
 meaning that it's somewhat safe to say that

1:40:02.060 --> 1:40:03.980
 not getting sufficient sleep will lead

1:40:03.980 --> 1:40:07.980
 to some kind of impairment in any one given individual.

1:40:07.980 --> 1:40:10.540
 It may not be the same impairment,

1:40:10.540 --> 1:40:12.620
 but it's likely to be an impairment.

1:40:12.620 --> 1:40:14.460
 But to come back to the question,

1:40:14.460 --> 1:40:16.780
 I think it's wrong to tell anyone

1:40:16.780 --> 1:40:19.300
 that it's wrong to do what they're doing,

1:40:19.300 --> 1:40:21.700
 even if they are compromising their sleep,

1:40:21.700 --> 1:40:24.780
 even if they're compromising their mental health.

1:40:24.780 --> 1:40:28.340
 As long as they're not hurting anyone else,

1:40:28.340 --> 1:40:31.020
 then I think the answer is

1:40:31.020 --> 1:40:32.940
 that's that person's choice.

1:40:32.940 --> 1:40:34.140
 Yeah, but that's that person's life.

1:40:34.140 --> 1:40:35.540
 I'd like to push back further.

1:40:35.540 --> 1:40:37.980
 So see, the way you kind of said it,

1:40:39.100 --> 1:40:41.660
 yes, you're absolutely right.

1:40:41.660 --> 1:40:45.380
 But I would like to say a stronger statement,

1:40:45.380 --> 1:40:49.340
 which is you should let go of that judgment

1:40:49.340 --> 1:40:51.220
 of somebody is wrong

1:40:51.220 --> 1:40:53.140
 and allow yourself to be inspired

1:40:53.140 --> 1:40:55.860
 by the great heights they have reached.

1:40:55.860 --> 1:40:59.900
 So take yourself out of the seat of being a judger

1:40:59.900 --> 1:41:01.380
 of what is healthy or not,

1:41:01.380 --> 1:41:05.180
 and appreciate the greatness of a particular human.

1:41:05.180 --> 1:41:06.940
 You watch the Olympics,

1:41:06.940 --> 1:41:09.020
 the kind of things that some athletes do

1:41:09.020 --> 1:41:11.700
 to reach the very heights.

1:41:11.700 --> 1:41:14.940
 The Olympics are taking years off of their life.

1:41:14.940 --> 1:41:18.460
 They suffer depression after the Olympics often.

1:41:18.460 --> 1:41:21.020
 The physiology is disastrous.

1:41:21.020 --> 1:41:22.540
 Everything, their personal life,

1:41:22.540 --> 1:41:26.180
 there's their psychology, their physiology,

1:41:27.140 --> 1:41:28.980
 everything, it's a giant mess.

1:41:28.980 --> 1:41:31.580
 So the question is about life.

1:41:32.900 --> 1:41:37.820
 Healthy now means longevity,

1:41:38.980 --> 1:41:42.860
 quality of life over a prolonged period of time,

1:41:42.860 --> 1:41:46.260
 optimum performance over a prolonged period of time.

1:41:46.260 --> 1:41:51.260
 But to me, beauty is reaching great heights.

1:41:52.220 --> 1:41:54.100
 And there's a dance there

1:41:54.100 --> 1:41:56.220
 that sometimes reaching great heights

1:41:56.220 --> 1:41:58.300
 requires sacrifice of health

1:41:58.300 --> 1:42:01.420
 and not like a calculation

1:42:01.420 --> 1:42:02.780
 where you sat down on a sheet of paper

1:42:02.780 --> 1:42:05.700
 and say, I'm going to take seven years off my life

1:42:05.700 --> 1:42:07.540
 for an Olympic gold medal.

1:42:07.540 --> 1:42:11.020
 No, it requires more chaotic journey

1:42:11.020 --> 1:42:13.300
 that doesn't do that kind of calculus.

1:42:13.300 --> 1:42:15.820
 And I just want to kind of speak to the,

1:42:15.820 --> 1:42:19.420
 in the culture that struggles of what is healthy and not,

1:42:19.420 --> 1:42:22.820
 we want to be able to speak to what is healthy

1:42:22.820 --> 1:42:26.460
 and at the same time be inspired by the great heights

1:42:26.460 --> 1:42:29.900
 that humans reach no matter how healthy

1:42:29.900 --> 1:42:32.700
 or unhealthy they live.

1:42:32.700 --> 1:42:34.140
 Yeah, I agree with that.

1:42:34.140 --> 1:42:35.500
 I think if that's a flag you're hoisting,

1:42:35.500 --> 1:42:38.380
 I will definitely salute it because it really depends,

1:42:38.380 --> 1:42:41.660
 what are you trying to optimize for in your life?

1:42:41.660 --> 1:42:43.020
 And if you are,

1:42:43.020 --> 1:42:46.380
 I think the only danger potentially with that mindset

1:42:46.380 --> 1:42:50.420
 is that if you look at many of the studies

1:42:50.420 --> 1:42:53.340
 of old age and end of life,

1:42:53.340 --> 1:42:57.220
 most people say I never look back on my life

1:42:57.220 --> 1:43:01.260
 and wish I worked harder.

1:43:01.260 --> 1:43:06.260
 I wish instead I'd spent more time with family, friends

1:43:06.620 --> 1:43:08.380
 and engaged in that aspect.

1:43:08.380 --> 1:43:11.300
 Now I'm not saying though, coming back to your point,

1:43:11.300 --> 1:43:13.820
 that that is the standard rubric for everyone.

1:43:13.820 --> 1:43:15.860
 I don't believe it is too.

1:43:15.860 --> 1:43:17.660
 And there are many things that you and I

1:43:17.660 --> 1:43:19.580
 are both benefiting from today,

1:43:19.580 --> 1:43:21.260
 even in the field of medicine,

1:43:21.260 --> 1:43:26.260
 where people have sacrificed their own longevity

1:43:26.420 --> 1:43:30.260
 for the quest of solving a particular medical problem.

1:43:31.220 --> 1:43:36.220
 And they died quicker because of their commitment,

1:43:37.820 --> 1:43:40.380
 because they wished to try and solve that problem

1:43:40.380 --> 1:43:43.100
 in their pursuit of greatness scientifically.

1:43:43.100 --> 1:43:44.820
 And I now benefit.

1:43:44.820 --> 1:43:46.580
 Am I grateful that they did that?

1:43:46.580 --> 1:43:48.460
 Incredibly grateful.

1:43:48.460 --> 1:43:51.700
 You know, a simpler demonstration is this.

1:43:51.700 --> 1:43:54.540
 If tonight at 4 a.m. in the morning,

1:43:54.540 --> 1:43:59.540
 I have a ruptured appendix, I have an appendicitis,

1:43:59.820 --> 1:44:04.580
 I am incredibly grateful that there is an emergency team

1:44:04.580 --> 1:44:07.700
 that will take me to the hospital at 4 a.m. in the morning.

1:44:07.700 --> 1:44:11.220
 They are awake, they're not sleeping and they save my life.

1:44:12.380 --> 1:44:17.380
 And that's part of what their life's mission and quest is.

1:44:17.380 --> 1:44:20.620
 And they saved another's life by, in some ways,

1:44:20.620 --> 1:44:23.860
 shaving a little of their own off.

1:44:23.860 --> 1:44:27.060
 So I don't take, I have no umbrage

1:44:27.060 --> 1:44:29.340
 with that mentality at all.

1:44:29.340 --> 1:44:30.860
 I think you just have to be very clear

1:44:30.860 --> 1:44:34.060
 about what you're optimizing for.

1:44:34.060 --> 1:44:39.060
 And my worry is that most people fall into the rat race

1:44:39.060 --> 1:44:41.380
 and they never actually ask the question,

1:44:41.380 --> 1:44:42.860
 why am I doing this?

1:44:42.860 --> 1:44:47.860
 If you're just working nine to five or,

1:44:47.860 --> 1:44:50.220
 and you allow that nine to five to stretch

1:44:50.220 --> 1:44:53.340
 into much longer, but it's nevertheless a job

1:44:53.340 --> 1:44:55.660
 that's kind of like wears you down.

1:44:55.660 --> 1:44:56.540
 That's one thing.

1:44:56.540 --> 1:44:59.980
 Another thing is when it is like, you're,

1:44:59.980 --> 1:45:04.460
 it's a dream, it's a life mission.

1:45:04.460 --> 1:45:09.140
 And for that, I think as long as you know what it is

1:45:09.140 --> 1:45:11.100
 that you could be doing to yourself

1:45:11.100 --> 1:45:13.620
 and you are comfortable and A okay with that,

1:45:15.260 --> 1:45:17.860
 I have no problem with that at all.

1:45:17.860 --> 1:45:21.700
 Again, as I said, as a scientist, I cannot, should not,

1:45:21.700 --> 1:45:24.900
 and will not tell anyone what they should do with their life.

1:45:24.900 --> 1:45:28.100
 All I want you to be able to do is say, okay,

1:45:28.100 --> 1:45:31.700
 now I understand more about the,

1:45:31.700 --> 1:45:35.860
 previously these would be known unknowns

1:45:35.860 --> 1:45:38.260
 and these were the unknown unknowns.

1:45:38.260 --> 1:45:41.420
 And now I am slightly more cognizant.

1:45:41.420 --> 1:45:46.420
 I have more knowns than I had before

1:45:46.460 --> 1:45:48.420
 regarding my sleep and my health,

1:45:48.420 --> 1:45:49.940
 knowing that information,

1:45:49.940 --> 1:45:53.860
 do I still choose to make this decision?

1:45:53.860 --> 1:45:56.980
 And if that's what I offered,

1:45:57.820 --> 1:45:59.540
 then I think I've done my job.

1:45:59.540 --> 1:46:02.420
 That's all I want to offer is just added information

1:46:02.420 --> 1:46:04.900
 into the decision algorithm.

1:46:04.900 --> 1:46:09.260
 And what you end up choosing as an output of that algorithm

1:46:09.260 --> 1:46:11.220
 has nothing to do with me.

1:46:11.220 --> 1:46:14.700
 It's not my business and I will never judge anyone for it.

1:46:14.700 --> 1:46:16.700
 And as I said, I'm immensely grateful for people

1:46:16.700 --> 1:46:19.580
 who have sacrificed much in their lives

1:46:19.580 --> 1:46:21.380
 to give me what I have.

1:46:21.380 --> 1:46:23.940
 So you're saying as long as the sacrifice sort of grounded

1:46:23.940 --> 1:46:27.540
 in knowledge of what the sacrifice is,

1:46:27.540 --> 1:46:29.020
 that sleep is important, all those kinds of things.

1:46:29.020 --> 1:46:30.260
 And that you're comfortable with it.

1:46:30.260 --> 1:46:32.140
 That is, it is your conscious choice

1:46:32.140 --> 1:46:34.500
 rather than feeling as though you're trapped

1:46:34.500 --> 1:46:38.020
 or that you are just, you haven't thought about it.

1:46:38.020 --> 1:46:41.260
 And you start that job at age 32

1:46:41.260 --> 1:46:44.100
 and then you wake up the next morning and you're 65

1:46:44.100 --> 1:46:45.620
 and you think, where did my life go?

1:46:45.620 --> 1:46:46.940
 What was I doing?

1:46:46.940 --> 1:46:49.500
 That to me, I would feel, I would want to hug you.

1:46:49.500 --> 1:46:52.940
 And I would say, I'm just, and I'm not saying,

1:46:52.940 --> 1:46:56.420
 I don't want to sound belittling here at all.

1:46:56.420 --> 1:46:58.940
 I would just not wish that for you.

1:46:58.940 --> 1:47:03.940
 I would wish that you could have thought about

1:47:03.940 --> 1:47:06.420
 what it was that you're doing and not have that regret.

1:47:06.420 --> 1:47:09.860
 Yeah, so I guess I'm, this is for you, the listener.

1:47:09.860 --> 1:47:11.820
 I'm coming out of the closet here a little bit.

1:47:11.820 --> 1:47:14.460
 The fact that I enjoy the madness I live in.

1:47:14.460 --> 1:47:17.260
 So please do not criticize me, embrace me.

1:47:17.260 --> 1:47:20.620
 I understand the sacrifices I'm making.

1:47:20.620 --> 1:47:22.340
 I enjoy sleeping on the floor

1:47:22.340 --> 1:47:24.820
 when I'm passionate programming all night

1:47:24.820 --> 1:47:28.460
 and just pass out on the carpet.

1:47:28.460 --> 1:47:29.940
 I love this life.

1:47:29.940 --> 1:47:33.700
 Okay, so it's, but it's definitely something I think about

1:47:33.700 --> 1:47:37.860
 that there's a balance, a strike where.

1:47:37.860 --> 1:47:40.180
 I just want you to have as much of it though.

1:47:40.180 --> 1:47:41.020
 Of life.

1:47:44.380 --> 1:47:47.740
 See, quality of life is important.

1:47:49.180 --> 1:47:50.180
 I should have said,

1:47:50.180 --> 1:47:52.860
 I want you to have as much high quality life.

1:47:52.860 --> 1:47:55.740
 And if high quality of life means

1:47:57.220 --> 1:48:01.060
 I spend five decades on this planet,

1:48:01.060 --> 1:48:04.500
 but yet in that time, I am thrilled every day.

1:48:04.500 --> 1:48:07.740
 I'm turned on every day by what I do.

1:48:07.740 --> 1:48:12.740
 And I reveled in this thing called my life's work.

1:48:14.060 --> 1:48:17.100
 I think that that is a 50 year journey

1:48:17.100 --> 1:48:21.820
 of absolute delight and fulfillment that you should take.

1:48:24.340 --> 1:48:26.540
 I think about my death all the time.

1:48:26.540 --> 1:48:27.820
 I meditate on death.

1:48:27.820 --> 1:48:31.580
 I'm okay to die today.

1:48:31.580 --> 1:48:36.580
 So to me, longevity is not a significant goal.

1:48:37.340 --> 1:48:40.140
 I'm so happy to be alive.

1:48:40.140 --> 1:48:43.460
 I don't even think it would suck to die today.

1:48:43.460 --> 1:48:47.500
 I'm as afraid of it today as I will be in 50 years.

1:48:48.500 --> 1:48:51.940
 I don't wanna die as much today as I will in 50 years.

1:48:51.940 --> 1:48:55.060
 There's of course all these experiences

1:48:55.060 --> 1:48:59.860
 I would like to have, but everything's already amazing.

1:48:59.860 --> 1:49:01.020
 It's like that Lego movie.

1:49:01.020 --> 1:49:02.900
 So I don't know.

1:49:02.900 --> 1:49:06.540
 So to me, I just wanna keep doing this.

1:49:06.540 --> 1:49:11.540
 And there's of course things that could affect,

1:49:12.380 --> 1:49:16.860
 like you mentioned, dementia and these deterioration

1:49:16.860 --> 1:49:21.140
 of the mind or the body that can significantly affect

1:49:21.140 --> 1:49:23.540
 the quality of life.

1:49:23.540 --> 1:49:25.220
 And so you want to do.

1:49:25.220 --> 1:49:26.220
 As long as you're aware of that,

1:49:26.220 --> 1:49:29.100
 and that's the price you pay for the entry

1:49:29.100 --> 1:49:32.860
 into this magical kingdom that you are experiencing,

1:49:32.860 --> 1:49:34.300
 which is a lovely thing.

1:49:34.300 --> 1:49:37.020
 I feel privileged too.

1:49:37.020 --> 1:49:38.900
 I can't believe the life that I live.

1:49:38.900 --> 1:49:41.580
 It's incredible.

1:49:41.580 --> 1:49:46.580
 And just like you, I think about mortality a great deal.

1:49:46.700 --> 1:49:51.700
 I think a lot about death, but I don't worry about death.

1:49:51.700 --> 1:49:55.660
 I probably, with the exception of the potential pain

1:49:55.660 --> 1:49:58.020
 that comes before it, that some people,

1:49:58.020 --> 1:50:01.740
 many people can suffer, that maybe concerns me.

1:50:01.740 --> 1:50:06.620
 But I actually think about mortality as a tool,

1:50:06.620 --> 1:50:11.620
 I use it as a lens through which I can then retrospect.

1:50:12.260 --> 1:50:16.540
 And by placing myself at the point of future mortality,

1:50:16.540 --> 1:50:20.020
 I can then use it as a retrospective lens

1:50:20.020 --> 1:50:22.980
 to focus and ask the following question.

1:50:22.980 --> 1:50:26.460
 Is there anything I feel I would regret

1:50:26.460 --> 1:50:30.140
 and therefore change in the life that I currently have now?

1:50:31.220 --> 1:50:35.740
 That's the way I meditate and use mortality as a question,

1:50:35.740 --> 1:50:39.100
 is to try and course correct and focus my life.

1:50:39.100 --> 1:50:41.300
 I worry not about dying,

1:50:42.700 --> 1:50:44.500
 but I like to think about death

1:50:44.500 --> 1:50:47.180
 as a way to prioritize my life.

1:50:47.180 --> 1:50:49.060
 If that makes sense, I don't know if that makes sense.

1:50:49.060 --> 1:50:52.740
 No, it makes total sense to decide

1:50:52.740 --> 1:50:55.260
 how do you want to live today

1:50:55.260 --> 1:50:59.020
 so that in the future you do not regret

1:50:59.020 --> 1:51:00.140
 the way you've lived today.

1:51:00.140 --> 1:51:02.380
 Right, and to place yourself in the future

1:51:02.380 --> 1:51:06.260
 at your point of mortality is one way to, I think,

1:51:06.260 --> 1:51:10.500
 as an exercise to retrospectively look back

1:51:10.500 --> 1:51:13.020
 and not lose out on informed choices

1:51:13.020 --> 1:51:15.420
 that you could otherwise lose out on

1:51:15.420 --> 1:51:18.060
 if you weren't thinking about mortality.

1:51:18.060 --> 1:51:21.020
 Yeah, it clarifies your thinking.

1:51:23.220 --> 1:51:24.900
 So I mentioned I sleep on the floor,

1:51:24.900 --> 1:51:28.620
 take naps and power naps, and it's just kind of madness.

1:51:28.620 --> 1:51:31.860
 Is there weirdnesses to your own sleep schedule

1:51:31.860 --> 1:51:35.300
 as a scientist that does incredible work,

1:51:35.300 --> 1:51:37.100
 has a lot of things going on,

1:51:39.340 --> 1:51:41.820
 has to lead research, has to write research,

1:51:41.820 --> 1:51:44.580
 has to be a science communicator,

1:51:44.580 --> 1:51:46.780
 also have a social life, all those kinds of things.

1:51:46.780 --> 1:51:49.940
 Is there certain patterns to your own sleep

1:51:49.940 --> 1:51:54.940
 that you regret or you participate in

1:51:56.100 --> 1:51:58.420
 that you find you enjoy?

1:51:59.540 --> 1:52:02.420
 Is there some personal stuff,

1:52:02.420 --> 1:52:04.580
 quirks or things you're proud of

1:52:04.580 --> 1:52:07.340
 that you do in terms of your sleep schedule?

1:52:07.340 --> 1:52:10.580
 The funny thing about being a sleep researcher

1:52:10.580 --> 1:52:13.020
 is that it doesn't make you immune

1:52:13.020 --> 1:52:16.300
 to the ravages of difficult nights of sleep,

1:52:16.300 --> 1:52:21.300
 and I have battled my own periods of insomnia in my life too.

1:52:24.620 --> 1:52:26.900
 And I think I've been fortunate in ways

1:52:26.900 --> 1:52:28.460
 because I know how sleep works

1:52:28.460 --> 1:52:30.260
 and I know how to combat insomnia.

1:52:30.260 --> 1:52:32.660
 I know how to get it under control

1:52:32.660 --> 1:52:36.940
 because insomnia in many ways is a condition

1:52:36.940 --> 1:52:40.500
 where all of a sudden your sleep controls you

1:52:40.500 --> 1:52:42.540
 rather than you control your sleep.

1:52:42.540 --> 1:52:46.780
 Wow, yeah, that's a beautiful way to put it, yeah.

1:52:46.780 --> 1:52:51.780
 And I know when I'm starting to lose control

1:52:52.060 --> 1:52:54.860
 and it's starting to take control,

1:52:54.860 --> 1:52:56.860
 and I understand how to regain,

1:52:57.980 --> 1:53:01.420
 but it doesn't happen overnight.

1:53:01.420 --> 1:53:03.620
 It takes a long time.

1:53:03.620 --> 1:53:06.780
 So you've struggled with insomnia in your life?

1:53:06.780 --> 1:53:08.340
 I have, not all of my life.

1:53:08.340 --> 1:53:10.340
 I would say I've probably had three or four

1:53:10.340 --> 1:53:14.860
 really severe bouts, and all of them usually triggered

1:53:14.860 --> 1:53:17.740
 by emotional circumstances, by stress.

1:53:19.020 --> 1:53:22.180
 Stress that's connected to actual events in life

1:53:22.180 --> 1:53:24.380
 or stress that's unexplainable?

1:53:24.380 --> 1:53:26.580
 Well, externally triggered.

1:53:26.580 --> 1:53:30.020
 Yeah, it's sort of what we would call reactive stress.

1:53:33.100 --> 1:53:36.420
 And so that's sort of point number one

1:53:36.420 --> 1:53:38.620
 about the idiosyncrasies.

1:53:38.620 --> 1:53:41.140
 The point number two is that when you are having

1:53:41.140 --> 1:53:44.980
 a difficult night of sleep, as a sleep researcher,

1:53:44.980 --> 1:53:47.780
 you basically have become the Woody Allen neurotic

1:53:47.780 --> 1:53:48.780
 of the sleep world.

1:53:49.820 --> 1:53:52.980
 Because at that moment, I'm trying to fall asleep

1:53:52.980 --> 1:53:54.980
 and I'm not, and I'm starting to think,

1:53:54.980 --> 1:53:57.020
 okay, my dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex

1:53:57.020 --> 1:53:57.900
 is not shutting down.

1:53:57.900 --> 1:53:59.820
 My noradrenaline is not ramping down.

1:53:59.820 --> 1:54:01.140
 My sympathetic nervous system

1:54:01.140 --> 1:54:02.900
 is not giving way to my parasympathetic.

1:54:02.900 --> 1:54:05.380
 At that point, you are dead in the water

1:54:05.380 --> 1:54:08.100
 for the next two hours and nothing is bringing you back.

1:54:08.100 --> 1:54:11.420
 So there is some irony in that too.

1:54:11.420 --> 1:54:13.420
 I would say for myself though,

1:54:14.580 --> 1:54:16.860
 if there is something I'm not proud of,

1:54:16.860 --> 1:54:21.860
 it has been at times railing against my chronotype.

1:54:23.100 --> 1:54:25.500
 So your chronotype is essentially,

1:54:25.500 --> 1:54:27.300
 are you a morning type, evening type

1:54:27.300 --> 1:54:28.460
 or somewhere in between?

1:54:29.340 --> 1:54:32.540
 And there were times because society

1:54:32.540 --> 1:54:37.020
 is desperately biased towards the morning types.

1:54:37.020 --> 1:54:40.500
 This notion of the early bird catches the worm.

1:54:40.500 --> 1:54:42.620
 Maybe that's true, but I'll also tell you

1:54:42.620 --> 1:54:44.540
 that the second mouse gets the cheese.

1:54:46.180 --> 1:54:51.180
 Yeah, so I think one of the issues around,

1:54:52.300 --> 1:54:55.260
 firstly, people don't really understand chronotype

1:54:55.260 --> 1:54:56.540
 because I'll have some people

1:54:56.540 --> 1:54:58.060
 when I'm sort of out in the public,

1:54:58.060 --> 1:55:00.140
 they'll say, look, I struggle with terrible insomnia.

1:55:00.140 --> 1:55:02.300
 And I'll ask them, is it problems falling asleep

1:55:02.300 --> 1:55:03.140
 or staying asleep?

1:55:03.140 --> 1:55:05.100
 And they'll say, falling asleep.

1:55:05.100 --> 1:55:07.860
 And then I'll say, look, if you are on a desert island

1:55:07.860 --> 1:55:11.660
 with nothing to wake up for, no responsibilities,

1:55:11.660 --> 1:55:13.140
 what time would you normally go to bed

1:55:13.140 --> 1:55:14.260
 and what time would you wake up?

1:55:14.260 --> 1:55:15.780
 And they would say, I'd probably like to go to bed

1:55:15.780 --> 1:55:18.620
 about midnight and wake up maybe eight in the morning.

1:55:18.620 --> 1:55:20.860
 And then I'd say, so what time do you now go to bed?

1:55:20.860 --> 1:55:22.900
 And they'd say, well, I've got to be up for work early.

1:55:22.900 --> 1:55:25.300
 So I get into bed at 10.

1:55:25.300 --> 1:55:26.740
 I say, well, you don't have insomnia.

1:55:26.740 --> 1:55:29.820
 You have a mismatch between your biological chronotype

1:55:29.820 --> 1:55:31.740
 and your current sleep schedule.

1:55:31.740 --> 1:55:33.580
 And when you align those two,

1:55:33.580 --> 1:55:35.860
 and I was fighting that for some time too,

1:55:35.860 --> 1:55:40.740
 I'm probably mostly right in the middle.

1:55:40.740 --> 1:55:43.660
 I am desperately vanilla, unfortunately,

1:55:43.660 --> 1:55:47.020
 in many aspects of life, but this included,

1:55:47.020 --> 1:55:48.380
 I'm neither a strong morning type

1:55:48.380 --> 1:55:49.900
 nor a strong evening type.

1:55:49.900 --> 1:55:53.460
 So ideally I'd probably like to go to bed around 11,

1:55:53.460 --> 1:55:56.860
 10.30, 11, probably somewhere between 10.30, 11,

1:55:56.860 --> 1:56:00.180
 and wake up, I naturally wake up usually most days

1:56:00.180 --> 1:56:05.180
 before my alarm at 7.04, and it's 7.04

1:56:05.900 --> 1:56:08.500
 because why not be idiosyncratic

1:56:08.500 --> 1:56:09.340
 in terms of setting an alarm?

1:56:09.340 --> 1:56:10.940
 I love it.

1:56:10.940 --> 1:56:13.100
 And so I...

1:56:13.100 --> 1:56:14.060
 That's kind of awesome.

1:56:14.060 --> 1:56:15.020
 I've never heard about that.

1:56:15.020 --> 1:56:16.140
 That's amazing.

1:56:16.140 --> 1:56:17.300
 I'm gonna start doing that now,

1:56:17.300 --> 1:56:20.300
 setting alarms like a little bit off the...

1:56:20.300 --> 1:56:21.140
 Yeah, I know.

1:56:21.140 --> 1:56:22.380
 I'm never quite sure why we all...

1:56:22.380 --> 1:56:24.780
 It's a celebration of uniqueness.

1:56:24.780 --> 1:56:28.780
 Yeah, and I am quite the odd snowflake in that sense too.

1:56:28.780 --> 1:56:31.460
 So I would usually then try to force myself

1:56:31.460 --> 1:56:33.820
 because I had that same mentality

1:56:33.820 --> 1:56:38.820
 that if I wasn't up at 6.30 and in the gym by seven

1:56:38.980 --> 1:56:41.740
 that there was something wrong with me.

1:56:41.740 --> 1:56:44.460
 And I quickly abandoned that.

1:56:44.460 --> 1:56:46.540
 But if I look back, if there was a shameful act

1:56:46.540 --> 1:56:47.820
 that I have around my sleep,

1:56:47.820 --> 1:56:49.820
 I think it would be that for some years

1:56:49.820 --> 1:56:53.020
 until I really started to get more detailed into sleep.

1:56:53.020 --> 1:56:56.500
 And now I have no shame in telling people

1:56:56.500 --> 1:57:01.500
 that I will probably usually wake up around 6.45 naturally,

1:57:02.420 --> 1:57:06.020
 sometimes seven when people are looking at me thinking,

1:57:06.020 --> 1:57:07.860
 you're a sloth, you're lazy.

1:57:08.740 --> 1:57:12.620
 And I don't finish my daily workout

1:57:12.620 --> 1:57:16.900
 until I'm not working until probably nine o clock

1:57:16.900 --> 1:57:19.420
 in the morning thinking, what are you doing?

1:57:19.420 --> 1:57:22.860
 Now I will work late into the day.

1:57:22.860 --> 1:57:25.420
 If I could, I would work 16 hours.

1:57:25.420 --> 1:57:27.220
 It's my passion just like yours.

1:57:29.380 --> 1:57:31.860
 So I don't feel shame around that,

1:57:31.860 --> 1:57:34.340
 but I have changed my mentality around that.

1:57:35.420 --> 1:57:40.420
 It's complicated because I'm probably happiest

1:57:42.100 --> 1:57:45.820
 going to bed, if I'm being honest, like at 5 a.m.

1:57:45.820 --> 1:57:46.660
 That's fine.

1:57:46.660 --> 1:57:48.100
 You're just an extreme evening type.

1:57:48.100 --> 1:57:53.100
 But the problem is it's not that I'm ashamed for it.

1:57:53.100 --> 1:57:56.500
 I actually kind of enjoy it because I get to sleep

1:57:56.500 --> 1:57:59.620
 through all the nonsense of like the morning.

1:57:59.620 --> 1:58:01.140
 Isn't that a beautiful thing?

1:58:01.140 --> 1:58:03.220
 Like people are busy with their emails

1:58:03.220 --> 1:58:06.300
 and I just am happy as a cow.

1:58:06.300 --> 1:58:09.900
 And I wake up after all the drama has been resolved.

1:58:09.900 --> 1:58:12.260
 And cows are happy and the drama has been resolved.

1:58:12.260 --> 1:58:13.420
 Exactly.

1:58:13.420 --> 1:58:16.060
 But in society you do, especially,

1:58:16.060 --> 1:58:17.860
 I mean this is what I think about is

1:58:19.220 --> 1:58:20.980
 when you work on a larger team,

1:58:20.980 --> 1:58:23.940
 especially with companies, you are,

1:58:25.060 --> 1:58:26.740
 everybody's awake at the same time.

1:58:26.740 --> 1:58:29.620
 So that's definitely been a struggle

1:58:29.620 --> 1:58:32.860
 to try to figure out, just like you said,

1:58:32.860 --> 1:58:35.460
 how to balance that, how to fit into society

1:58:35.460 --> 1:58:38.500
 and yet be optimal for your chronotype, you said.

1:58:38.500 --> 1:58:42.060
 Yeah, you have to sleep in synchrony with it and harmony.

1:58:42.900 --> 1:58:47.500
 Because normally what we know is that if you fight biology,

1:58:47.500 --> 1:58:48.860
 you'll normally lose.

1:58:48.860 --> 1:58:51.420
 And the way you know you've lost is through disease

1:58:51.420 --> 1:58:52.980
 and sickness.

1:58:52.980 --> 1:58:56.500
 You said you suffered through several bouts of insomnia.

1:58:57.460 --> 1:59:02.420
 Is there, aside from embracing your chronotype,

1:59:02.420 --> 1:59:05.900
 is there advice you can give how to overcome insomnia

1:59:05.900 --> 1:59:07.740
 from your own experience?

1:59:07.740 --> 1:59:09.620
 Right now the best method that we have

1:59:09.620 --> 1:59:11.780
 is something called cognitive behavioral therapy

1:59:11.780 --> 1:59:14.980
 for insomnia or CBTI for short.

1:59:14.980 --> 1:59:18.700
 And you work with, for people who don't know what it is,

1:59:18.700 --> 1:59:21.340
 you work with a therapist for maybe six weeks

1:59:21.340 --> 1:59:22.700
 and you can do it online, by the way,

1:59:22.700 --> 1:59:25.780
 I recommend probably jumping online, it's just the easiest.

1:59:26.700 --> 1:59:31.060
 And it will change your beliefs, your habits,

1:59:31.060 --> 1:59:33.020
 your behaviors and your general stress

1:59:33.020 --> 1:59:34.740
 around this thing called sleep.

1:59:34.740 --> 1:59:36.660
 And it is just as effective as sleeping pills

1:59:36.660 --> 1:59:38.020
 in the short term.

1:59:38.020 --> 1:59:40.460
 But what's great is that unlike sleeping pills,

1:59:40.460 --> 1:59:43.060
 when you stop working with your therapist,

1:59:43.060 --> 1:59:45.740
 those benefits last for years later.

1:59:45.740 --> 1:59:47.260
 Whereas when you stop your sleeping pills,

1:59:47.260 --> 1:59:49.460
 you typically have what's called rebound insomnia,

1:59:49.460 --> 1:59:51.100
 where your sleep not only goes back to being

1:59:51.100 --> 1:59:54.340
 as bad as it was before, it's usually even worse.

1:59:55.300 --> 1:59:59.580
 For me, I think I found a number of things effective.

2:00:00.660 --> 2:00:02.580
 The first is that I had to really address

2:00:02.580 --> 2:00:06.780
 what was stressful and try to come up with

2:00:06.780 --> 2:00:11.580
 some degree of meaningful rationality around it.

2:00:11.580 --> 2:00:13.620
 Because I think one of the things that happens,

2:00:13.620 --> 2:00:15.860
 there's something very, talking about conscious states,

2:00:15.860 --> 2:00:19.540
 to come all the way back to, gosh, I don't know,

2:00:19.540 --> 2:00:21.740
 I feel like we've only been chatting for like 20 minutes,

2:00:21.740 --> 2:00:23.340
 but you're gonna tell me it's been a while.

2:00:23.340 --> 2:00:24.380
 Yeah, it's been a while.

2:00:24.380 --> 2:00:27.980
 Okay, I'm desperately, I feel terribly sorry.

2:00:27.980 --> 2:00:29.420
 But let's come back to conscious states,

2:00:29.420 --> 2:00:31.300
 which is where we started.

2:00:32.860 --> 2:00:36.380
 There is something very strange about the night

2:00:36.380 --> 2:00:41.340
 that thoughts and anxieties are not the same

2:00:41.340 --> 2:00:43.380
 as they are in the waking day.

2:00:43.380 --> 2:00:45.780
 They are worse, they are bigger.

2:00:45.780 --> 2:00:49.460
 And I at least find that I am far

2:00:51.900 --> 2:00:56.860
 more likely to catastrophize and ruminate

2:00:56.860 --> 2:00:59.540
 at night about things that when I wake up the next day

2:00:59.540 --> 2:01:01.300
 in the broad light of day,

2:01:01.300 --> 2:01:03.940
 I think it's nowhere near that bad, man.

2:01:03.940 --> 2:01:04.860
 What were you doing?

2:01:04.860 --> 2:01:06.860
 It's not that bad at all.

2:01:06.860 --> 2:01:10.380
 So to gain firstly, some rational understanding

2:01:10.380 --> 2:01:14.220
 of my emotional state that's causing that insomnia

2:01:14.220 --> 2:01:15.660
 was very helpful.

2:01:15.660 --> 2:01:18.900
 The second thing was to keep regularity,

2:01:18.900 --> 2:01:21.260
 just going to bed at the same time waking up.

2:01:21.260 --> 2:01:25.340
 And here's an unconventional piece of sleep advice.

2:01:25.340 --> 2:01:30.340
 After a bad night of sleep, do nothing.

2:01:31.820 --> 2:01:36.820
 Don't wake up any later, don't go to bed any earlier,

2:01:37.220 --> 2:01:39.620
 don't nap during the day,

2:01:39.620 --> 2:01:42.500
 and don't drink any more coffee than you would otherwise.

2:01:42.500 --> 2:01:47.140
 Because if you end up sleeping later into the morning,

2:01:47.140 --> 2:01:49.420
 you're then not going to be tired

2:01:49.420 --> 2:01:51.020
 at your normal time at night.

2:01:51.020 --> 2:01:53.180
 So then you're gonna get into bed thinking,

2:01:53.180 --> 2:01:55.060
 well, I had a terrible night of sleep last night.

2:01:55.060 --> 2:01:58.780
 And yes, I slept in this morning to try and compensate,

2:01:58.780 --> 2:02:00.900
 but I'm still gonna get to bed at my normal time.

2:02:00.900 --> 2:02:03.580
 But now you get into bed and you haven't been awake

2:02:03.580 --> 2:02:05.380
 for as long as you normally would.

2:02:05.380 --> 2:02:07.660
 So you're not as sleepy as you normally would be.

2:02:07.660 --> 2:02:10.260
 And so now you sit there lying in bed

2:02:10.260 --> 2:02:12.100
 and it's another bad night.

2:02:12.100 --> 2:02:15.900
 And the same thing is, if you go to bed any earlier,

2:02:15.900 --> 2:02:20.020
 so don't wake up any later, wake up at the same time,

2:02:20.020 --> 2:02:21.540
 don't go to bed any earlier,

2:02:21.540 --> 2:02:23.740
 because then you're just probably your chronotype,

2:02:23.740 --> 2:02:26.500
 your biological rhythm doesn't want you to be asleep.

2:02:26.500 --> 2:02:28.940
 And you think, well, it's a terrible night,

2:02:28.940 --> 2:02:31.020
 I'm gonna get into bed at 9 p.m.

2:02:31.020 --> 2:02:32.540
 rather than my standard 10,

2:02:32.540 --> 2:02:35.220
 I'm just gonna be lying in bed awake for that hour.

2:02:35.220 --> 2:02:37.300
 Naps will take our double edged sword,

2:02:37.300 --> 2:02:38.580
 they can have wonderful benefits.

2:02:38.580 --> 2:02:40.420
 And we've done lots of studies on naps

2:02:40.420 --> 2:02:42.060
 for both the brain and the body.

2:02:42.060 --> 2:02:45.380
 But they are a double edged sword in the sense that

2:02:45.380 --> 2:02:49.900
 napping will just take the edge off your sleepiness.

2:02:49.900 --> 2:02:52.060
 It's a little bit like a valve on a pressure cooker.

2:02:52.060 --> 2:02:54.100
 When you nap during the day,

2:02:54.100 --> 2:02:56.660
 you can take some of that healthy sleepiness

2:02:56.660 --> 2:02:58.940
 that you've been building up during the day.

2:02:58.940 --> 2:03:00.700
 And for some people, not all people,

2:03:00.700 --> 2:03:02.620
 but for some people that can then make it harder

2:03:02.620 --> 2:03:04.060
 for them to fall asleep at night

2:03:04.060 --> 2:03:07.140
 and then stay asleep soundly across the night.

2:03:07.140 --> 2:03:08.260
 So the advice would be,

2:03:08.260 --> 2:03:10.060
 if you're struggling with sleep at night,

2:03:10.060 --> 2:03:12.060
 don't nap during the day.

2:03:12.060 --> 2:03:14.540
 But if you are not struggling with sleep,

2:03:14.540 --> 2:03:17.700
 and you can nap regularly, naps are just fine.

2:03:17.700 --> 2:03:20.180
 And we can play around with optimal durations

2:03:20.180 --> 2:03:21.580
 depending on what you want.

2:03:21.580 --> 2:03:23.740
 Just try not to nap too late into the day

2:03:23.740 --> 2:03:25.220
 because napping late into the day

2:03:25.220 --> 2:03:27.380
 is like snacking before your main meal.

2:03:27.380 --> 2:03:30.380
 It just takes the edge off your sleep hunger as it were.

2:03:30.380 --> 2:03:34.260
 But that would be, so that's my unconventional

2:03:34.260 --> 2:03:37.180
 second piece of advice regarding insomnia.

2:03:37.180 --> 2:03:39.020
 The third is meditation.

2:03:39.020 --> 2:03:41.260
 I found meditation to be incredibly powerful.

2:03:41.260 --> 2:03:43.940
 I started reading about meditation

2:03:43.940 --> 2:03:48.940
 as I was researching that aspect of the book many years ago.

2:03:49.220 --> 2:03:51.060
 And as a hard nose scientist,

2:03:51.060 --> 2:03:53.700
 I thought this sounds very woo woo.

2:03:53.700 --> 2:03:57.340
 This is sort of, we all hold hands and sing come by hour

2:03:57.340 --> 2:03:59.420
 and everything's going to be fine with sleep.

2:03:59.420 --> 2:04:02.660
 I read the data and it was compelling.

2:04:02.660 --> 2:04:04.260
 I couldn't ignore it.

2:04:04.260 --> 2:04:08.140
 And I started meditating and that was six years ago

2:04:08.140 --> 2:04:09.660
 and I haven't stopped.

2:04:09.660 --> 2:04:14.260
 And I find meditation before bed incredibly powerful.

2:04:14.260 --> 2:04:17.500
 The meditation app companies were perplexed at this at first.

2:04:17.500 --> 2:04:19.420
 They want people to meditate during the day.

2:04:19.420 --> 2:04:21.700
 But when they looked at their usage statistics,

2:04:21.700 --> 2:04:23.500
 they found that they would have people

2:04:23.500 --> 2:04:24.980
 in the morning meditating.

2:04:24.980 --> 2:04:26.900
 And then there's a huge number of people

2:04:26.900 --> 2:04:28.940
 using the meditation app in the evening.

2:04:28.940 --> 2:04:32.500
 What they were doing was self medicating their insomnia.

2:04:32.500 --> 2:04:34.940
 And they finally, rather than railing against it,

2:04:34.940 --> 2:04:39.660
 they started to see it as a cash cow, rightly so.

2:04:39.660 --> 2:04:41.820
 So I found meditation to be helpful.

2:04:41.820 --> 2:04:43.380
 Having a wind down routine

2:04:43.380 --> 2:04:45.820
 is the other thing that's critical for me.

2:04:45.820 --> 2:04:47.500
 I can't just go from,

2:04:47.500 --> 2:04:49.140
 because when my mind is switched on

2:04:49.140 --> 2:04:51.540
 and I think you may be like this too,

2:04:51.540 --> 2:04:55.700
 if I get into bed, that Rolodex of thoughts

2:04:55.700 --> 2:04:59.980
 and information and excitement and anxiety and worry

2:04:59.980 --> 2:05:02.620
 is just whirling away.

2:05:02.620 --> 2:05:05.220
 And it's not gonna be a good night for me.

2:05:05.220 --> 2:05:07.580
 So I have to find a wind down routine.

2:05:07.580 --> 2:05:10.540
 And that makes sense when you realize what sleep is like.

2:05:10.540 --> 2:05:12.260
 Sleep is not like a light switch.

2:05:14.060 --> 2:05:16.980
 Sleep is much more like trying to land a plane.

2:05:16.980 --> 2:05:19.260
 You know, it takes time to descend down

2:05:19.260 --> 2:05:23.260
 onto the terra firma that we call sound sleep at night.

2:05:23.260 --> 2:05:24.780
 And we have this for kids.

2:05:24.780 --> 2:05:26.660
 You know, I don't have children,

2:05:26.660 --> 2:05:29.460
 but you know, a lot of parents will say,

2:05:29.460 --> 2:05:33.380
 you know, we have to have the bedroom,

2:05:33.380 --> 2:05:35.060
 sorry, the bedtime routine.

2:05:35.060 --> 2:05:37.540
 You know, you bathe the kid, you put them in bed,

2:05:37.540 --> 2:05:38.820
 you read them a story.

2:05:38.820 --> 2:05:40.500
 You have to go through this routine,

2:05:40.500 --> 2:05:42.340
 this wind down routine for them.

2:05:42.340 --> 2:05:44.460
 And then they fall asleep wonderfully.

2:05:44.460 --> 2:05:46.700
 Why do we abandon that?

2:05:46.700 --> 2:05:51.380
 As adults, we need that same wind down routine.

2:05:51.380 --> 2:05:53.180
 So that's been the other thing

2:05:53.180 --> 2:05:54.620
 that's been very helpful to me.

2:05:54.620 --> 2:05:57.140
 So don't do anything different.

2:05:57.140 --> 2:05:58.780
 If you have a bad night of sleep,

2:05:58.780 --> 2:06:00.980
 keep doing the same thing.

2:06:00.980 --> 2:06:04.060
 Manage your anxiety, understand it, rationalize it.

2:06:05.380 --> 2:06:09.100
 Then meditation, and then finally having

2:06:09.100 --> 2:06:11.940
 some kind of disengagement wind down routine.

2:06:11.940 --> 2:06:15.580
 Those are the four things that have been very helpful to me.

2:06:15.580 --> 2:06:16.420
 That's brilliant.

2:06:16.420 --> 2:06:20.580
 So the regularities really do a lot of work against insomnia.

2:06:20.580 --> 2:06:21.420
 Is there,

2:06:21.420 --> 2:06:26.420
 is it possible to have a healthy sleep life

2:06:28.700 --> 2:06:30.980
 without the regularities?

2:06:30.980 --> 2:06:34.780
 I say that because I'm all over the place

2:06:34.780 --> 2:06:37.180
 and I've gotten good at being all over the place.

2:06:38.060 --> 2:06:40.700
 So I'll often, like what happens,

2:06:40.700 --> 2:06:42.100
 I'll go stretches of time.

2:06:42.100 --> 2:06:44.660
 There'll be sometimes a month where I,

2:06:44.660 --> 2:06:47.540
 my days are like, this is embarrassing to admit,

2:06:47.540 --> 2:06:49.180
 but they're like,

2:06:49.180 --> 2:06:51.740
 just you and I here, just you and I.

2:06:51.740 --> 2:06:55.100
 It's like 28 hours or 30 hour days.

2:06:55.100 --> 2:06:58.540
 Like I'll just go all the way around

2:06:58.540 --> 2:07:00.780
 comfortably and happily, I love it.

2:07:00.780 --> 2:07:02.380
 And then there'll be a nap.

2:07:02.380 --> 2:07:05.300
 I mean, if you like add up the hours

2:07:05.300 --> 2:07:08.980
 when I'm just like sleeping as much as I want,

2:07:08.980 --> 2:07:12.740
 it'd probably be like six hour average per 24 hours.

2:07:12.740 --> 2:07:16.660
 Like that kind of, so it works out nicely,

2:07:16.660 --> 2:07:18.460
 maybe even seven hours, I don't know.

2:07:18.460 --> 2:07:21.500
 But that it's obviously irregular

2:07:21.500 --> 2:07:23.620
 and there's chaos in the whole thing.

2:07:23.620 --> 2:07:25.380
 Like sometimes it's shorter sleep,

2:07:25.380 --> 2:07:26.700
 sometimes it's longer.

2:07:26.700 --> 2:07:31.220
 Is that totally not a good thing, do you think?

2:07:31.220 --> 2:07:34.060
 The best evidence that we have to speak to this question

2:07:34.060 --> 2:07:36.340
 is people who are doing rotating shifts.

2:07:37.580 --> 2:07:41.940
 And unfortunately the news is not good.

2:07:41.940 --> 2:07:45.780
 They usually have a higher instance of many diseases

2:07:45.780 --> 2:07:50.740
 such as depression, diabetes, cardiovascular disease,

2:07:50.740 --> 2:07:54.020
 obesity, stroke.

2:07:54.020 --> 2:07:59.020
 And again, that's just me communicating the data

2:08:04.060 --> 2:08:06.500
 that we have and I'm not telling you

2:08:06.500 --> 2:08:08.780
 that you should do anything different.

2:08:08.780 --> 2:08:13.220
 The other thing is that there's nothing in your biology

2:08:13.220 --> 2:08:16.460
 that suggests that that's how your body was designed

2:08:16.460 --> 2:08:17.300
 to sleep.

2:08:18.180 --> 2:08:22.020
 It is a system that loves habit.

2:08:22.020 --> 2:08:27.020
 You know, if your circadian clock in your brain,

2:08:27.860 --> 2:08:30.820
 it's called the suprachiasmatic nucleus,

2:08:30.820 --> 2:08:33.820
 sits in the middle of your brain, had a personality trait,

2:08:33.820 --> 2:08:36.460
 it would be a creature of habit.

2:08:36.460 --> 2:08:38.340
 It loves habit.

2:08:38.340 --> 2:08:42.100
 That's how your biology is designed to work

2:08:42.100 --> 2:08:47.100
 is through very archetypal prototypical expected cycles.

2:08:47.940 --> 2:08:52.460
 And when we do something different to that,

2:08:52.460 --> 2:08:57.340
 then you start to see some of the pressure stress fractures

2:08:57.340 --> 2:08:58.780
 in the system.

2:08:58.780 --> 2:09:02.540
 But again, to your point, if that's something

2:09:02.540 --> 2:09:06.940
 that you don't mind, you know, adopting and understanding

2:09:06.940 --> 2:09:11.820
 and then I think you should keep doing

2:09:11.820 --> 2:09:12.660
 what you're doing.

2:09:12.660 --> 2:09:13.540
 Yeah, it's complicated.

2:09:13.540 --> 2:09:15.340
 Of course you have to be a student of your own body

2:09:15.340 --> 2:09:16.220
 and explore it.

2:09:16.220 --> 2:09:18.460
 One of the reasons I want to have kids

2:09:19.860 --> 2:09:22.500
 is kids enforce a stricter schedule.

2:09:23.540 --> 2:09:28.540
 I think I definitely feel that I'm not living

2:09:29.700 --> 2:09:33.660
 the sort of data wise, scientifically speaking,

2:09:33.660 --> 2:09:34.980
 the optimal life.

2:09:34.980 --> 2:09:37.940
 And me just living the way I want to live day to day

2:09:37.940 --> 2:09:40.020
 is perhaps not the optimal way.

2:09:40.020 --> 2:09:41.940
 And there's certain things that I've seen

2:09:41.940 --> 2:09:45.660
 very successful people that I know in my life

2:09:45.660 --> 2:09:48.460
 when they get, when they have kids,

2:09:48.460 --> 2:09:50.460
 they actually, the productivity goes up,

2:09:50.460 --> 2:09:51.620
 they get their shit together.

2:09:51.620 --> 2:09:55.460
 There's a lot of aspects that, yeah, the regularity.

2:09:55.460 --> 2:09:56.820
 I mean, that creatures a habit.

2:09:56.820 --> 2:09:58.860
 That's the thing that's power.

2:09:58.860 --> 2:10:01.500
 And then you start to optimally use the hours

2:10:01.500 --> 2:10:02.700
 that you have in the day.

2:10:02.700 --> 2:10:03.540
 Let me ask you about that.

2:10:03.540 --> 2:10:06.460
 Well, actually, I just have one quick point on that too.

2:10:06.460 --> 2:10:11.460
 You know, we often think about sleep as a cost,

2:10:14.220 --> 2:10:17.260
 but instead I think of sleep as an investment.

2:10:18.460 --> 2:10:20.660
 And the reason is because your effectiveness

2:10:20.660 --> 2:10:23.100
 and your efficiency when you're well slept

2:10:24.060 --> 2:10:26.180
 typically exceeds that when you're not.

2:10:27.060 --> 2:10:29.940
 And to me, it's the idea of if I'm going to boil

2:10:29.940 --> 2:10:34.940
 a pot of water, why would I boil it on medium

2:10:34.940 --> 2:10:37.420
 when I could boil it in half the time on high?

2:10:39.060 --> 2:10:43.140
 And I sometimes worry that when I speak

2:10:43.140 --> 2:10:46.700
 to Fortune 500 companies and they're of this mentality

2:10:46.700 --> 2:10:51.220
 of longer hours, getting people to rise and grind,

2:10:52.380 --> 2:10:55.700
 the first point is that after about 20 hours of being awake,

2:10:55.700 --> 2:10:58.260
 a human being is as cognitively as impaired

2:10:58.260 --> 2:11:01.260
 as they would be if they were legally drunk.

2:11:01.260 --> 2:11:03.500
 And the reason I bring that point up

2:11:03.500 --> 2:11:07.940
 is because I don't know any company or CEO

2:11:07.940 --> 2:11:10.460
 who would say, I've got this great team,

2:11:10.460 --> 2:11:11.660
 they're drunk all the time.

2:11:12.780 --> 2:11:15.900
 But we often lord the airport warrior

2:11:15.900 --> 2:11:18.940
 who's flown through three different time zones

2:11:18.940 --> 2:11:21.540
 in the past two days, is on email at 2 a.m.

2:11:21.540 --> 2:11:24.300
 and then is in the office at six.

2:11:25.420 --> 2:11:28.580
 And I think there is some aspect, not in all people,

2:11:28.580 --> 2:11:29.980
 but there is sort of some aspect

2:11:29.980 --> 2:11:32.620
 of that slight sleep machismo.

2:11:32.620 --> 2:11:36.900
 And that's not what you are very different.

2:11:36.900 --> 2:11:40.420
 You are driven by a purity of passion

2:11:40.420 --> 2:11:44.140
 and a very authentic, incredibly genuine goal

2:11:44.140 --> 2:11:48.140
 of wanting to do something remarkable with your life.

2:11:48.140 --> 2:11:51.540
 That's not the issue I think I'm speaking about.

2:11:52.740 --> 2:11:55.060
 It's just simply that I think

2:11:55.060 --> 2:12:00.060
 maybe this notion of wanting to be awake for longer

2:12:02.900 --> 2:12:06.820
 to try and get more done can sometimes be at odds

2:12:06.820 --> 2:12:11.260
 with the fact that you can actually get so much more done

2:12:11.260 --> 2:12:12.660
 if you're well slept.

2:12:12.660 --> 2:12:14.460
 And it's this trade off.

2:12:14.460 --> 2:12:17.660
 I actually admire people that take the big risk

2:12:17.660 --> 2:12:20.260
 and work hard, whether that means staying up late at night,

2:12:20.260 --> 2:12:21.900
 all those kinds of things,

2:12:21.900 --> 2:12:24.340
 but it cannot be in the framework,

2:12:24.340 --> 2:12:26.100
 in the context like what Edison said,

2:12:26.100 --> 2:12:28.700
 which is sleep feels like a waste of time.

2:12:29.900 --> 2:12:32.580
 So if you're not sleeping

2:12:32.580 --> 2:12:36.500
 because you think sleep is stupid, that's totally wrong.

2:12:36.500 --> 2:12:37.780
 But if you're not sleeping

2:12:37.780 --> 2:12:39.820
 because you're deeply passionate about something,

2:12:39.820 --> 2:12:43.380
 that to me, it's a gray area, of course,

2:12:43.380 --> 2:12:45.220
 but that to me is much more admirable.

2:12:45.220 --> 2:12:48.260
 And everything you're espousing is saying

2:12:48.260 --> 2:12:49.620
 whatever the hell you're doing,

2:12:49.620 --> 2:12:51.660
 you better be aware that sleep,

2:12:51.660 --> 2:12:54.660
 long term and short term is really good for you.

2:12:54.660 --> 2:12:57.220
 So if you're not sleeping, you're sacrificing,

2:12:57.220 --> 2:13:00.060
 just make sure you're sacrificing for the right thing.

2:13:00.060 --> 2:13:04.020
 I see vodka and getting drunk the same way.

2:13:04.020 --> 2:13:05.500
 I know it's not good for me.

2:13:05.500 --> 2:13:08.460
 I know I'm not gonna feel good days after.

2:13:08.460 --> 2:13:10.340
 I know it's gonna decrease my performance.

2:13:10.340 --> 2:13:12.780
 And there's nothing positive about it,

2:13:12.780 --> 2:13:17.500
 except it introduces chaos in my life

2:13:17.500 --> 2:13:20.300
 that introduces beautiful experiences

2:13:20.300 --> 2:13:22.100
 that I would not otherwise have.

2:13:22.100 --> 2:13:27.100
 It creates this turmoil of social interaction

2:13:27.500 --> 2:13:29.780
 that ultimately makes me happy

2:13:29.780 --> 2:13:31.900
 that I've experienced them in the moment

2:13:31.900 --> 2:13:34.580
 and later the stories, you get to meet new people.

2:13:34.580 --> 2:13:36.580
 It's like alcohol in this society

2:13:36.580 --> 2:13:40.340
 is an incredible facilitator of that.

2:13:40.340 --> 2:13:43.980
 So that's a good example of not sleeping

2:13:43.980 --> 2:13:46.380
 and drinking way too much vodka.

2:13:46.380 --> 2:13:51.380
 Again, it's this notion of life is to be lived to a degree.

2:13:51.740 --> 2:13:54.500
 But if you do have children,

2:13:55.780 --> 2:13:56.820
 I think one of the other things

2:13:56.820 --> 2:13:58.660
 that then maybe comes into the picture

2:13:58.660 --> 2:14:03.380
 is the fact that now there are other people

2:14:03.380 --> 2:14:06.700
 that you have to live for than yourself.

2:14:07.620 --> 2:14:10.740
 Yeah, but come on, like once they're old enough,

2:14:10.740 --> 2:14:13.580
 like if you can't defend for yourself,

2:14:13.580 --> 2:14:15.620
 you're too weak, get stronger.

2:14:15.620 --> 2:14:17.780
 It's gonna be that kind of fatherhood.

2:14:17.780 --> 2:14:21.620
 I got it, I'm understanding so much more

2:14:21.620 --> 2:14:23.860
 about Lex Freeman than I did before.

2:14:23.860 --> 2:14:27.260
 That's why you have to have for me,

2:14:27.260 --> 2:14:29.540
 that would be my wife would be probably softer.

2:14:29.540 --> 2:14:31.740
 It's good cop, bad cop, because I think I'm.

2:14:33.500 --> 2:14:35.540
 But of course, actually, because I don't have kids,

2:14:35.540 --> 2:14:39.740
 I've seen some tough dudes when they have kids

2:14:39.740 --> 2:14:44.340
 become like the softies.

2:14:44.340 --> 2:14:47.260
 They become like, they do everything for their kids.

2:14:47.260 --> 2:14:50.660
 It's become like, it's totally transforms their life.

2:14:50.660 --> 2:14:53.180
 I mean, Joe Rogan is an example of that.

2:14:53.180 --> 2:14:57.380
 I just seen so many tough guys completely become changed

2:14:57.380 --> 2:15:00.420
 by having kids, which is fascinating to watch

2:15:00.420 --> 2:15:03.540
 because it just shows you how meaningful having kids is

2:15:03.540 --> 2:15:04.380
 for a lot of people.

2:15:04.380 --> 2:15:09.380
 Although I would say having chatted with Joe for some time,

2:15:09.380 --> 2:15:13.020
 I think he is a delightful,

2:15:13.020 --> 2:15:14.980
 sweetheart, independent of children.

2:15:14.980 --> 2:15:17.180
 I think, don't get me wrong,

2:15:17.180 --> 2:15:19.740
 I don't wanna be in a ring with him.

2:15:19.740 --> 2:15:22.220
 He would face me five ways till Tuesday,

2:15:22.220 --> 2:15:24.740
 but I think he's a desperately sweet man

2:15:24.740 --> 2:15:26.700
 and a very, very smart individual.

2:15:26.700 --> 2:15:30.300
 Yeah, I mean, but he talks about the compassion he's gained

2:15:30.300 --> 2:15:32.940
 from realizing just watching kids grow up

2:15:32.940 --> 2:15:35.060
 that we were all kids at some point,

2:15:35.060 --> 2:15:37.100
 you get a new perspective.

2:15:37.100 --> 2:15:40.420
 I think just like me, I still get this with him.

2:15:40.420 --> 2:15:43.380
 He's super competitive and there's a certain way

2:15:43.380 --> 2:15:45.620
 to approach life.

2:15:45.620 --> 2:15:47.700
 You're striving to do great things

2:15:47.700 --> 2:15:49.820
 and you're competitive against others

2:15:49.820 --> 2:15:52.220
 and that intensity of that aggression,

2:15:53.140 --> 2:15:56.620
 that can lack compassion sometimes and empathy.

2:15:56.620 --> 2:15:58.980
 And when you have children, you get a sense like,

2:15:58.980 --> 2:16:00.940
 oh, everybody was a child at some point,

2:16:00.940 --> 2:16:02.420
 everybody was a kid.

2:16:02.420 --> 2:16:04.780
 And you see that whole development process.

2:16:04.780 --> 2:16:07.300
 It can definitely enrich,

2:16:07.300 --> 2:16:12.300
 expand your ability to be empathetic.

2:16:13.420 --> 2:16:15.020
 Let me ask about diet.

2:16:16.180 --> 2:16:19.540
 So what's the connection between diet and sleep?

2:16:19.540 --> 2:16:21.220
 So I do intermittent fasting,

2:16:21.220 --> 2:16:24.740
 sometimes only one meal a day, sometimes no meals a day.

2:16:24.740 --> 2:16:26.700
 Is there a good science on the interaction

2:16:26.700 --> 2:16:29.860
 between fasting and sleep?

2:16:29.860 --> 2:16:33.060
 We have some data, I would prefer more,

2:16:33.060 --> 2:16:36.940
 but we have data both on time restricted eating

2:16:38.580 --> 2:16:43.580
 and then we have some data on fasting to a degree.

2:16:45.980 --> 2:16:47.860
 On time restricted eating,

2:16:49.260 --> 2:16:51.300
 I think that it has some benefits,

2:16:51.300 --> 2:16:53.020
 although the human replication studies

2:16:53.020 --> 2:16:54.540
 have actually not borne out

2:16:54.540 --> 2:16:57.620
 quite the same health benefit extent

2:16:57.620 --> 2:16:59.060
 that the animal studies have.

2:16:59.060 --> 2:17:01.820
 There've been some disappointing studies,

2:17:01.820 --> 2:17:05.820
 one here close to where we are right now at UCSF recently.

2:17:06.820 --> 2:17:09.940
 So I think time restricted eating can be a good thing

2:17:09.940 --> 2:17:13.140
 and there are many benefits of time restricted eating.

2:17:13.140 --> 2:17:14.260
 Is sleep one of them?

2:17:14.260 --> 2:17:15.940
 No, it doesn't seem to be

2:17:15.940 --> 2:17:17.820
 because there are probably at the time

2:17:17.820 --> 2:17:18.740
 that we're recording this,

2:17:18.740 --> 2:17:21.580
 three pretty decent studies that I'm aware of.

2:17:22.420 --> 2:17:25.740
 Two out of the three were in obese individuals,

2:17:25.740 --> 2:17:29.340
 one out of the three were in healthy weight individuals.

2:17:29.340 --> 2:17:31.580
 And what they found is that time restricted eating

2:17:31.580 --> 2:17:33.500
 in all three of those studies

2:17:33.500 --> 2:17:36.380
 didn't have any advantageous benefit to sleep.

2:17:36.380 --> 2:17:38.700
 It didn't necessarily harm sleep,

2:17:38.700 --> 2:17:41.820
 but it didn't seem to improve it.

2:17:41.820 --> 2:17:43.220
 When it comes to fasting though,

2:17:43.220 --> 2:17:45.980
 which is a different state,

2:17:45.980 --> 2:17:47.500
 we don't have too many studies,

2:17:47.500 --> 2:17:49.500
 experimental studies with longterm fasting.

2:17:49.500 --> 2:17:50.780
 The best data that we have

2:17:50.780 --> 2:17:53.020
 is probably from religious practices

2:17:53.020 --> 2:17:56.980
 and probably the most data we have is during Ramadan

2:17:56.980 --> 2:18:01.100
 where people will fast for 29 to 30 days

2:18:01.100 --> 2:18:03.140
 from sunrise to sunset.

2:18:04.660 --> 2:18:07.220
 And under those conditions,

2:18:07.220 --> 2:18:12.220
 there are probably five distinct changes that we've seen.

2:18:13.820 --> 2:18:16.220
 None of them seem to be particularly good for sleep.

2:18:16.220 --> 2:18:18.420
 The first is that the amount of melatonin

2:18:18.420 --> 2:18:20.740
 that you release, and melatonin is a hormone.

2:18:20.740 --> 2:18:23.420
 It's often called the hormone of darkness

2:18:23.420 --> 2:18:25.300
 or the vampire hormone,

2:18:25.300 --> 2:18:27.100
 not because it makes you look longingly

2:18:27.100 --> 2:18:28.300
 at people's necklines,

2:18:28.300 --> 2:18:31.060
 but it's just because it comes out at night.

2:18:31.060 --> 2:18:33.660
 Melatonin signals to your brain and your body

2:18:33.660 --> 2:18:36.980
 that it's dark, it's nighttime, and it's time to sleep.

2:18:36.980 --> 2:18:38.220
 Those individuals,

2:18:38.220 --> 2:18:40.780
 when they were undergoing that regimen of fasting,

2:18:42.580 --> 2:18:44.540
 the amount of melatonin that was released

2:18:44.540 --> 2:18:45.860
 and when it was released,

2:18:45.860 --> 2:18:48.060
 the amount of melatonin decreased

2:18:48.060 --> 2:18:50.900
 and when it was released came later.

2:18:50.900 --> 2:18:52.100
 That was the first thing.

2:18:52.100 --> 2:18:56.340
 The second thing was that they ended up finding it harder

2:18:56.340 --> 2:19:00.420
 to fall asleep as quickly as they normally would otherwise.

2:19:00.420 --> 2:19:02.580
 The third thing was that the total amount of sleep

2:19:02.580 --> 2:19:05.060
 that they were getting decreased.

2:19:05.060 --> 2:19:06.660
 The fourth fascinating thing

2:19:06.660 --> 2:19:09.140
 was that a wake promoting chemical

2:19:09.140 --> 2:19:12.060
 called orexin increased.

2:19:12.060 --> 2:19:13.900
 And this is why a lot of people will say,

2:19:13.900 --> 2:19:18.260
 when I'm fasting, it feels like I can stay awake for longer

2:19:18.260 --> 2:19:21.500
 and I'm more alert, I'm more active.

2:19:21.500 --> 2:19:23.820
 And I'll come back from an evolutionary perspective

2:19:23.820 --> 2:19:26.460
 why we understand that to be the case.

2:19:26.460 --> 2:19:28.820
 And then the fourth factor is that fasting

2:19:28.820 --> 2:19:31.380
 didn't decrease the amount of deep sleep

2:19:31.380 --> 2:19:33.140
 that seemed to be unaffected.

2:19:33.140 --> 2:19:35.220
 It did, however, decrease the amount

2:19:35.220 --> 2:19:37.260
 of REM sleep or dream sleep.

2:19:37.260 --> 2:19:38.580
 And we know that REM sleep dreaming

2:19:38.580 --> 2:19:42.300
 is essential for emotional first aid, mental health,

2:19:42.300 --> 2:19:45.140
 it's critical for memory, creativity.

2:19:45.140 --> 2:19:47.260
 It's also critical for several hormone functions.

2:19:47.260 --> 2:19:50.700
 It's when there's direct correlations

2:19:50.700 --> 2:19:54.180
 between testosterone release peaks

2:19:54.180 --> 2:19:57.940
 just before you go into REM sleep and during REM sleep too.

2:19:57.940 --> 2:20:00.100
 So REM sleep is critical.

2:20:00.100 --> 2:20:02.700
 But so those are the five changes that we've seen.

2:20:02.700 --> 2:20:05.980
 None of them seem to be that advantageous for sleep.

2:20:05.980 --> 2:20:07.740
 But the fourth point that I mentioned,

2:20:07.740 --> 2:20:12.180
 which was orexin, which is this wake promoting chemical

2:20:12.180 --> 2:20:15.140
 and a good demonstration or a very sad demonstration

2:20:15.140 --> 2:20:18.780
 of its power is when it becomes very deficient in the brain

2:20:18.780 --> 2:20:21.660
 and it leads to a condition called narcolepsy

2:20:21.660 --> 2:20:26.660
 where you're just unpredictable with your sleep.

2:20:26.660 --> 2:20:31.660
 So orexin when it's in high concentrations

2:20:33.100 --> 2:20:35.140
 keeps you awake when you lose it.

2:20:35.140 --> 2:20:38.860
 It can put you very much into a state of narcolepsy

2:20:38.860 --> 2:20:40.980
 where you're sleeping a lot of the time

2:20:40.980 --> 2:20:43.460
 in unpredictable sleep.

2:20:43.460 --> 2:20:46.580
 Why on earth when you are fasting

2:20:46.580 --> 2:20:51.580
 would the brain release awake promoting chemical?

2:20:51.660 --> 2:20:54.980
 And our answer is right now is the following.

2:20:54.980 --> 2:20:56.900
 One of the few times that I mentioned before

2:20:56.900 --> 2:21:00.580
 that we see animals undergoing insufficient sleep

2:21:00.580 --> 2:21:03.660
 or prolonged sleep deprivation

2:21:03.660 --> 2:21:05.660
 is under conditions of starvation.

2:21:06.540 --> 2:21:11.020
 And that is an extreme evolutionary pressure.

2:21:11.020 --> 2:21:14.020
 And at that point, the brain will forgo some.

2:21:14.020 --> 2:21:18.460
 It won't forgo all, but it will forgo some of its sleep.

2:21:18.460 --> 2:21:21.220
 And the reason is so that it can stay awake for longer

2:21:21.220 --> 2:21:24.460
 because the sign of starvation is saying to the brain,

2:21:24.460 --> 2:21:27.900
 you can't find food in your normal foraging perimeter,

2:21:27.900 --> 2:21:29.500
 you need to stay awake for longer

2:21:29.500 --> 2:21:31.700
 so you can travel outside of your perimeter

2:21:31.700 --> 2:21:33.980
 for a further distance

2:21:33.980 --> 2:21:37.300
 and maybe you will find food and save the organism.

2:21:37.300 --> 2:21:39.660
 So in other words, when we fast,

2:21:39.660 --> 2:21:43.620
 it's giving our brain this evolutionary signal

2:21:43.620 --> 2:21:46.380
 that you are under conditions of starvation.

2:21:46.380 --> 2:21:49.020
 So the brain responds by saying, oh my goodness,

2:21:49.020 --> 2:21:50.300
 I need to release the chemical

2:21:50.300 --> 2:21:52.900
 that helps the organism stay awake for longer

2:21:52.900 --> 2:21:54.300
 which is orexin.

2:21:54.300 --> 2:21:57.420
 So that they can forage for more food.

2:21:57.420 --> 2:21:59.940
 Now, of course, your brain from an evolutionary perspective

2:21:59.940 --> 2:22:02.340
 doesn't know about this thing called Safeway

2:22:02.340 --> 2:22:05.820
 that you could easily go to and break the fast.

2:22:05.820 --> 2:22:08.340
 But that's how we understand fasting.

2:22:08.340 --> 2:22:11.180
 And I think my dear friend, Peter Attia

2:22:11.180 --> 2:22:14.060
 has done a lot of work in this area too.

2:22:14.060 --> 2:22:17.340
 I think fasting and David Sinclair's brilliant work,

2:22:17.340 --> 2:22:20.140
 goodness me, what an individual too.

2:22:20.140 --> 2:22:21.940
 The work is pretty clear there

2:22:21.940 --> 2:22:25.100
 that time restricted eating and fasting

2:22:25.100 --> 2:22:27.860
 have wonderful health benefits.

2:22:27.860 --> 2:22:32.740
 Fasting creates this thing called hormesis,

2:22:32.740 --> 2:22:36.380
 just like exercise and low level stress

2:22:36.380 --> 2:22:38.740
 and sauna, heat, shock.

2:22:39.780 --> 2:22:41.620
 And hormesis is a biological process

2:22:41.620 --> 2:22:43.740
 I think as David Sinclair has once said,

2:22:43.740 --> 2:22:45.540
 in simple layman's terms is,

2:22:45.540 --> 2:22:47.540
 what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

2:22:47.540 --> 2:22:52.540
 And I think there is certainly good data

2:22:53.300 --> 2:22:56.220
 that fasting and time restricted eating has many benefits.

2:22:56.220 --> 2:22:57.740
 Is sleep one of them?

2:22:57.740 --> 2:23:00.660
 It doesn't seem to be, it doesn't seem to enhance sleep.

2:23:00.660 --> 2:23:04.700
 But it's interesting to understand its effects on sleep.

2:23:04.700 --> 2:23:09.700
 I've fasted, it's a study of NF2.

2:23:12.340 --> 2:23:16.820
 I once fasted 72 hours and another time 48 hours.

2:23:16.820 --> 2:23:20.340
 And I found that I got much less sleep

2:23:20.340 --> 2:23:22.580
 and it was very restful though.

2:23:22.580 --> 2:23:24.700
 I hesitate to say this, but this is how I felt,

2:23:24.700 --> 2:23:26.980
 which is I needed less sleep.

2:23:26.980 --> 2:23:28.820
 I wonder if my brain is deceiving me

2:23:28.820 --> 2:23:31.020
 because it feels like I'm getting

2:23:31.020 --> 2:23:35.380
 a whole extra amount of focus for free.

2:23:35.380 --> 2:23:39.660
 And I wonder if there's longterm impacts of that.

2:23:39.660 --> 2:23:41.740
 Because if I fast 24 hours,

2:23:42.740 --> 2:23:45.860
 get the same amount of calories, one meal a day,

2:23:45.860 --> 2:23:47.260
 there's a little bit of discomfort.

2:23:47.260 --> 2:23:50.500
 Like just maybe your body gets a little bit colder.

2:23:50.500 --> 2:23:54.540
 Maybe there's just, I mean, hunger.

2:23:54.540 --> 2:23:58.700
 But the amount of focus is crazy.

2:23:58.700 --> 2:24:00.620
 And so I wonder, it's like,

2:24:00.620 --> 2:24:02.060
 I'm a little suspicious of that.

2:24:02.060 --> 2:24:04.260
 I feel like I'm getting something for free.

2:24:04.260 --> 2:24:06.260
 I'm the same way with sweetener,

2:24:06.260 --> 2:24:07.740
 like a Splendor or something.

2:24:07.740 --> 2:24:10.340
 It's like, it's gotta be really bad for you, right?

2:24:10.340 --> 2:24:12.740
 Because why is it so tasty, right?

2:24:12.740 --> 2:24:17.740
 And I think, yeah, as we said before with biology,

2:24:18.580 --> 2:24:23.100
 if there's a gain, there's often a cost too.

2:24:25.180 --> 2:24:28.340
 But we at least understand the biological basis

2:24:28.340 --> 2:24:29.180
 of what you're describing.

2:24:29.180 --> 2:24:33.060
 It's not that you actually don't need less sleep.

2:24:33.060 --> 2:24:36.220
 It's that this chemical is present

2:24:36.220 --> 2:24:39.140
 that forces you more awake.

2:24:39.140 --> 2:24:41.940
 And so subjectively you feel as though

2:24:41.940 --> 2:24:45.180
 I don't need as much sleep because I'm wide awake.

2:24:45.180 --> 2:24:47.820
 And those two things are quite different.

2:24:47.820 --> 2:24:51.740
 It's not as though your sleep need has decreased.

2:24:51.740 --> 2:24:54.260
 It's that your brain has hit the overdrive switch,

2:24:54.260 --> 2:24:57.500
 the overboost switch to say, we need to keep you awake

2:24:57.500 --> 2:24:59.620
 because food is in short supply.

2:25:00.860 --> 2:25:03.340
 So you mentioned during sleep, there's a simulation,

2:25:03.340 --> 2:25:05.380
 all those kinds of things for learning purposes,

2:25:05.380 --> 2:25:08.140
 but there's also these, you mentioned the five ways

2:25:08.140 --> 2:25:11.300
 in which we become psychotic in dreams.

2:25:11.300 --> 2:25:14.380
 What do you think dreams are about?

2:25:16.260 --> 2:25:17.700
 Why do you think we dream?

2:25:17.700 --> 2:25:21.060
 What place do we go to when we dream?

2:25:21.060 --> 2:25:22.340
 And why are they useful?

2:25:22.340 --> 2:25:25.780
 Not just the assimilation aspect,

2:25:25.780 --> 2:25:29.460
 but just like all the crazy visuals that we get with dreams.

2:25:29.460 --> 2:25:33.340
 Is there something you can speak to that's actually useful?

2:25:33.340 --> 2:25:38.340
 Like why we have such fun experiences in that dream world?

2:25:38.340 --> 2:25:43.260
 So one of the camps in the sleep field

2:25:43.260 --> 2:25:46.420
 is that dreams are meaningless,

2:25:46.420 --> 2:25:49.580
 that they are an epiphenomenal byproduct

2:25:49.580 --> 2:25:53.260
 of this thing called REM sleep from which dreams come from

2:25:53.260 --> 2:25:55.380
 as a physiological state.

2:25:55.380 --> 2:26:00.340
 So the analogy would be, let's think of a light bulb,

2:26:00.340 --> 2:26:02.900
 that the reason that you create the apparatus

2:26:02.900 --> 2:26:06.340
 of a light bulb is to produce this thing called light

2:26:06.340 --> 2:26:08.660
 in the same way that we've evolved

2:26:08.660 --> 2:26:10.300
 to this thing called REM sleep

2:26:10.300 --> 2:26:13.700
 to serve whatever functions REM sleep serves.

2:26:13.700 --> 2:26:17.060
 But it turns out that when you create light in that way,

2:26:17.060 --> 2:26:19.820
 you also produce something called heat.

2:26:19.820 --> 2:26:22.780
 It was never the reason that you designed the light bulb,

2:26:22.780 --> 2:26:26.140
 it's just what happens when you create light in that way.

2:26:26.140 --> 2:26:29.140
 And the belief so too was that dreaming

2:26:29.140 --> 2:26:32.140
 was essentially the heat of the light bulb.

2:26:32.140 --> 2:26:34.820
 That REM sleep is critical,

2:26:34.820 --> 2:26:38.340
 but when you have REM sleep with a complex brain like ours,

2:26:38.340 --> 2:26:43.340
 you also produce this conscious epiphenomenon called dreaming.

2:26:44.500 --> 2:26:46.140
 I don't believe that for a second.

2:26:46.140 --> 2:26:50.660
 And from a simple perspective is that I suspect

2:26:50.660 --> 2:26:54.380
 that dreaming is more metabolically costly

2:26:54.380 --> 2:26:56.820
 as a conscious experience than not dreaming.

2:26:56.820 --> 2:26:58.580
 So you could still have REM sleep,

2:26:58.580 --> 2:27:01.860
 but absent the conscious experience of dreaming

2:27:01.860 --> 2:27:05.540
 was probably less metabolically costly.

2:27:05.540 --> 2:27:08.700
 And whenever mother nature burns the energy unit

2:27:08.700 --> 2:27:12.300
 called ATP, which is the most valuable thing,

2:27:13.620 --> 2:27:15.220
 there's usually a reason for it.

2:27:15.220 --> 2:27:20.220
 So if it's more energetically demanding,

2:27:20.340 --> 2:27:22.980
 then I suspect that there is a function to it.

2:27:22.980 --> 2:27:26.540
 And we've now since discovered that dreams have a function.

2:27:26.540 --> 2:27:29.100
 The first, as we mentioned, creativity.

2:27:29.100 --> 2:27:32.260
 The second is that dreams provide a form

2:27:32.260 --> 2:27:35.060
 of overnight therapy.

2:27:35.060 --> 2:27:38.780
 Dreaming is a form of emotional first aid.

2:27:38.780 --> 2:27:40.500
 And it's during dream sleep at night

2:27:40.500 --> 2:27:43.820
 that we take these difficult, painful experiences

2:27:43.820 --> 2:27:46.940
 that we've had during the day, sometimes traumatic,

2:27:46.940 --> 2:27:51.340
 and dream sleep acts almost like a nocturnal soothing balm.

2:27:51.340 --> 2:27:53.420
 And it sort of just takes the sharp edges

2:27:53.420 --> 2:27:56.260
 off those difficult, painful experiences

2:27:56.260 --> 2:27:58.580
 so that you come back the next day

2:27:58.580 --> 2:28:01.500
 and you feel better about them.

2:28:01.500 --> 2:28:03.940
 And so I think in that sense, dreaming,

2:28:03.940 --> 2:28:07.260
 it's not time that heals all wounds.

2:28:07.260 --> 2:28:09.340
 It's time during dream sleep

2:28:09.340 --> 2:28:12.580
 that provides emotional convalescence.

2:28:12.580 --> 2:28:17.580
 So dreaming is almost a form of emotional windscreen wipers.

2:28:19.860 --> 2:28:24.860
 And I think, and by the way, it's not just that you dream.

2:28:24.860 --> 2:28:29.860
 It's what you dream about that also matters.

2:28:30.020 --> 2:28:32.060
 So for example, scientists have done studies

2:28:32.060 --> 2:28:33.020
 with learning and memory

2:28:33.020 --> 2:28:36.060
 where they have people learn a virtual maze.

2:28:37.420 --> 2:28:40.420
 And what they discovered was that those people

2:28:40.420 --> 2:28:45.180
 who then dreamed, but dreamed of the maze

2:28:45.180 --> 2:28:47.820
 were the only ones who, when they woke up,

2:28:47.820 --> 2:28:50.740
 ended up being better at navigating the maze.

2:28:50.740 --> 2:28:53.380
 Whereas those people who dreamed,

2:28:53.380 --> 2:28:55.820
 but didn't dream about the maze itself,

2:28:55.820 --> 2:28:57.940
 they were no better at navigating the maze.

2:28:57.940 --> 2:28:59.060
 So it's not just that you,

2:28:59.060 --> 2:29:02.380
 it's not sort of necessary, but not sufficient.

2:29:02.380 --> 2:29:04.260
 It's necessary that you dream,

2:29:04.260 --> 2:29:06.780
 but it's not sufficient to produce the benefit.

2:29:06.780 --> 2:29:09.860
 You have to be dreaming about certain things itself.

2:29:09.860 --> 2:29:13.300
 And the same is true for mental health.

2:29:13.300 --> 2:29:14.740
 What we've discovered is that people

2:29:14.740 --> 2:29:17.100
 who are going through a very difficult experience,

2:29:17.100 --> 2:29:21.140
 a trauma, for example, a very painful divorce,

2:29:21.140 --> 2:29:23.820
 those people who are dreaming, but dreaming

2:29:23.820 --> 2:29:26.300
 of that difficult event itself,

2:29:26.300 --> 2:29:28.540
 they go on to gain resolution

2:29:28.540 --> 2:29:31.100
 to their clinical depression one year later.

2:29:31.100 --> 2:29:34.580
 Whereas people who were dreaming just as much,

2:29:34.580 --> 2:29:37.340
 but not dreaming about the trauma itself,

2:29:37.340 --> 2:29:40.700
 did not go on to gain as much clinical resolution

2:29:40.700 --> 2:29:42.260
 to their depression.

2:29:42.260 --> 2:29:46.860
 So it's, I think to me, those are the lines of evidence

2:29:46.860 --> 2:29:50.260
 that tell me dreaming is not epiphenomenal.

2:29:50.260 --> 2:29:53.820
 And it's not just about the act of dreaming,

2:29:53.820 --> 2:29:57.140
 it's about the content of the dreams,

2:29:57.140 --> 2:30:00.420
 not just the fact of a dream itself.

2:30:00.420 --> 2:30:01.780
 It's, first of all, it's fascinating.

2:30:01.780 --> 2:30:02.900
 It makes a lot of sense,

2:30:02.900 --> 2:30:05.540
 but then immediately takes my mind to,

2:30:05.540 --> 2:30:07.100
 from an engineering perspective,

2:30:07.100 --> 2:30:11.780
 how that could be useful in, for example, AI systems of,

2:30:13.140 --> 2:30:16.780
 if you think about dreaming as an important part

2:30:16.780 --> 2:30:21.780
 about learning and cognition and filtering previous memories

2:30:22.780 --> 2:30:25.380
 of what's important, integrating them.

2:30:25.380 --> 2:30:27.020
 You know, maybe you can correct me,

2:30:27.020 --> 2:30:31.420
 but I see dreaming as a kind of simulation of worlds

2:30:31.420 --> 2:30:34.540
 that are not constrained by physics.

2:30:34.540 --> 2:30:37.780
 So like you get a chance to take some of your memories,

2:30:37.780 --> 2:30:40.260
 some of your thoughts, some of your anxieties,

2:30:40.260 --> 2:30:43.900
 and play with them, like construct virtual worlds

2:30:43.900 --> 2:30:46.540
 and see how it evolves.

2:30:46.540 --> 2:30:48.820
 Like to play with those worlds

2:30:48.820 --> 2:30:51.980
 in a safe environment of your mind, safe in quotes,

2:30:51.980 --> 2:30:53.740
 because you could probably get into a lot of trouble

2:30:53.740 --> 2:30:56.900
 with the places your mind will go.

2:30:56.900 --> 2:31:01.900
 But this definitely is applied in much cruder ways

2:31:04.260 --> 2:31:05.820
 in artificial intelligence.

2:31:05.820 --> 2:31:08.700
 So one context in which this is applied

2:31:08.700 --> 2:31:12.740
 is the process called self play,

2:31:12.740 --> 2:31:14.380
 which is a reinforcement learning

2:31:14.380 --> 2:31:19.380
 where agents play against itself or versions of itself.

2:31:19.900 --> 2:31:23.340
 And it's all simulated of trying different versions

2:31:23.340 --> 2:31:25.260
 of themselves and playing against each other

2:31:25.260 --> 2:31:29.060
 to see what ends up being a good.

2:31:29.060 --> 2:31:32.580
 The ultimate goal is to learn a function

2:31:32.580 --> 2:31:34.820
 that represents what is good and what is not good

2:31:34.820 --> 2:31:36.260
 in terms of how you should act in the world.

2:31:36.260 --> 2:31:39.420
 You create a set of decision weights based on experience,

2:31:39.420 --> 2:31:41.500
 and you constantly update those weights

2:31:41.500 --> 2:31:43.020
 based on ongoing learning.

2:31:43.020 --> 2:31:45.940
 But the experience is artificially created

2:31:45.940 --> 2:31:48.580
 versus actual real data.

2:31:48.580 --> 2:31:51.580
 So it's a crude approximation of what dreams are,

2:31:51.580 --> 2:31:54.380
 which is you're hallucinating a lot of things

2:31:54.380 --> 2:31:56.420
 to see which things are actually.

2:31:56.420 --> 2:31:59.300
 No, I think it's been a theory that's been put forward,

2:31:59.300 --> 2:32:04.300
 which is that dreaming is a virtual reality test space

2:32:04.500 --> 2:32:06.700
 that is largely consequence free.

2:32:07.580 --> 2:32:11.100
 What an incredible gift to give a conscious mind

2:32:11.100 --> 2:32:13.260
 to each and every night.

2:32:13.260 --> 2:32:15.940
 Now the conscious mind, the human mind

2:32:15.940 --> 2:32:17.820
 is very good at constructing dreams

2:32:17.820 --> 2:32:20.700
 that are nevertheless useful for you.

2:32:20.700 --> 2:32:22.580
 Like they're wild and crazy,

2:32:22.580 --> 2:32:27.460
 but they're such that they are still grounded in reality

2:32:27.460 --> 2:32:29.980
 to a degree where anything you learn in dreams

2:32:29.980 --> 2:32:32.140
 might be useful in reality.

2:32:32.140 --> 2:32:34.420
 This is a very difficult thing to do

2:32:34.420 --> 2:32:36.580
 because it requires a lot of intelligence,

2:32:36.580 --> 2:32:38.020
 it requires consciousness.

2:32:38.020 --> 2:32:41.700
 This has been effectively recently being used

2:32:41.700 --> 2:32:45.980
 in a self supervised learning for computer vision

2:32:45.980 --> 2:32:50.060
 with the process of what's called data augmentation.

2:32:50.060 --> 2:32:53.260
 That's a very crude version of dreams,

2:32:53.260 --> 2:32:55.500
 which is you take data and you mess with it

2:32:56.700 --> 2:33:01.220
 and you start to learn how a picture of a cat

2:33:02.660 --> 2:33:06.980
 truly represents a cat by messing with it in different ways.

2:33:06.980 --> 2:33:09.780
 Now the crude methods currently are cropping, rotating,

2:33:09.780 --> 2:33:11.500
 distorting, all that kind of stuff.

2:33:11.500 --> 2:33:14.140
 But you can imagine much more complicated

2:33:14.980 --> 2:33:19.460
 generative processes that start hallucinating different cats

2:33:19.460 --> 2:33:23.140
 in order for you to understand deeply of what it means

2:33:23.140 --> 2:33:25.060
 for something to look like a cat.

2:33:25.060 --> 2:33:27.660
 What is the prototype of a archetype of a cat?

2:33:27.660 --> 2:33:28.500
 Yeah, the archetype.

2:33:28.500 --> 2:33:31.900
 I mean, that's a very difficult process for computer vision

2:33:31.900 --> 2:33:36.060
 to go from what are the pixels

2:33:36.060 --> 2:33:38.500
 that are usually associated with a cat

2:33:38.500 --> 2:33:42.860
 to like, what is a cat in the visual space?

2:33:42.860 --> 2:33:46.500
 In the three dimensional visual spaces projected on an image,

2:33:46.500 --> 2:33:50.260
 on a two dimensional image, what is a cat?

2:33:50.260 --> 2:33:52.860
 Those are like fundamentally philosophical questions

2:33:52.860 --> 2:33:56.500
 that we humans don't know the answer to,

2:33:56.500 --> 2:33:57.900
 like linguistically.

2:33:57.900 --> 2:34:00.900
 But when we look at a picture of a cat and a dog,

2:34:00.900 --> 2:34:04.300
 we can usually tell pretty damn well what's the difference.

2:34:04.300 --> 2:34:06.980
 And I don't know what that is because you can't reduce that

2:34:06.980 --> 2:34:09.980
 to pointy ears or non pointy ears,

2:34:09.980 --> 2:34:12.460
 furry or not furry, something about the eyes.

2:34:12.460 --> 2:34:14.860
 It's been a long standing issue in cognitive science,

2:34:14.860 --> 2:34:16.620
 cognitive neuroscience too,

2:34:16.620 --> 2:34:20.180
 is how does the brain create an archetype?

2:34:20.180 --> 2:34:25.020
 How does it create schemas that have general applicability,

2:34:26.220 --> 2:34:29.700
 but yet still obtain specificity?

2:34:29.700 --> 2:34:31.660
 That's a very difficult challenge.

2:34:31.660 --> 2:34:33.340
 I mean, we can do it, we do it.

2:34:33.340 --> 2:34:35.620
 It's rather bloody amazing.

2:34:35.620 --> 2:34:37.700
 And it seems like part of the toolbox

2:34:37.700 --> 2:34:41.100
 is this controlled hallucination, which is dreams.

2:34:41.100 --> 2:34:45.860
 Well, it's a relaxing of the rigid constraints.

2:34:45.860 --> 2:34:48.700
 I often think of dreaming as,

2:34:48.700 --> 2:34:52.660
 it's from an information processing standpoint,

2:34:52.660 --> 2:34:54.620
 the prison guards are away

2:34:54.620 --> 2:34:58.980
 and the prisoners are running a mock in a delightful way.

2:34:58.980 --> 2:35:00.580
 And part of the reason is because when you go

2:35:00.580 --> 2:35:03.580
 into dream sleep, the rational part of your brain

2:35:03.580 --> 2:35:05.860
 called the prefrontal cortex, which is the part,

2:35:05.860 --> 2:35:07.620
 it's like the CEO of the brain.

2:35:07.620 --> 2:35:09.500
 It's very good at making high level, rational,

2:35:09.500 --> 2:35:12.500
 top down decisions and controlled actions.

2:35:12.500 --> 2:35:17.260
 That part of the brain is shut down during REM sleep.

2:35:17.260 --> 2:35:20.580
 But then emotional centers, memory centers,

2:35:20.580 --> 2:35:24.140
 visual centers, motoric centers,

2:35:24.140 --> 2:35:27.180
 all of those centers actually become more active.

2:35:27.180 --> 2:35:29.540
 In fact, some of them are more active

2:35:29.540 --> 2:35:32.860
 than when we're awake in the dream state.

2:35:32.860 --> 2:35:33.700
 That's fascinating.

2:35:33.700 --> 2:35:37.300
 So your brain from a neural architecture perspective

2:35:37.300 --> 2:35:39.500
 is radically different.

2:35:39.500 --> 2:35:44.460
 Its network feature is not the same as wakefulness.

2:35:44.460 --> 2:35:48.100
 And I think this is an immensely beneficial thing

2:35:48.100 --> 2:35:51.700
 that we have at least two different rational

2:35:51.700 --> 2:35:54.220
 and irrational conscious states

2:35:54.220 --> 2:35:56.420
 that we do information processing in.

2:35:56.420 --> 2:35:58.180
 The rational, the veritical,

2:35:58.180 --> 2:36:01.380
 the page one of the Google search is wakefulness.

2:36:01.380 --> 2:36:05.980
 The more irrational, illogical, hyper associative

2:36:05.980 --> 2:36:08.620
 Google page 20 is the REM sleep.

2:36:08.620 --> 2:36:11.940
 Both I think are critical, both are necessary.

2:36:11.940 --> 2:36:12.780
 That's fascinating.

2:36:12.780 --> 2:36:15.660
 And again, fascinating to see how that could be integrated

2:36:15.660 --> 2:36:18.700
 in the machines to help them learn better

2:36:18.700 --> 2:36:21.660
 and to reason better.

2:36:22.620 --> 2:36:24.460
 And in some ways we also know it

2:36:24.460 --> 2:36:25.900
 from a chemical perspective too.

2:36:25.900 --> 2:36:27.820
 When you go into dream sleep,

2:36:27.820 --> 2:36:31.060
 it is a neurochemical cocktail like no other

2:36:31.060 --> 2:36:34.900
 that we see at the rest of the 24 hour state.

2:36:34.900 --> 2:36:37.700
 There is a chemical called noradrenaline

2:36:37.700 --> 2:36:40.380
 or norepinephrine in the brain.

2:36:40.380 --> 2:36:42.060
 And you know of its sister chemical

2:36:42.060 --> 2:36:44.500
 in the body called adrenaline.

2:36:44.500 --> 2:36:46.900
 But upstairs in the brain, noradrenaline

2:36:46.900 --> 2:36:49.620
 is very good at creating a very hyper focused,

2:36:49.620 --> 2:36:54.620
 attentive, narrow, it's sort of very convergent way

2:36:54.620 --> 2:36:59.620
 of thinking to a point, sharp focus, that's the only thing.

2:37:01.180 --> 2:37:04.100
 The spotlight of consciousness is very narrow.

2:37:04.100 --> 2:37:05.820
 That's noradrenaline.

2:37:05.820 --> 2:37:08.780
 When you remove noradrenaline,

2:37:08.780 --> 2:37:13.780
 then you go from a high SNR, a high signal to noise ratio

2:37:14.380 --> 2:37:16.860
 where it's just you and I in this moment,

2:37:16.860 --> 2:37:18.900
 I don't even know what's going on elsewhere.

2:37:18.900 --> 2:37:22.580
 I am with you, noradrenaline is present.

2:37:22.580 --> 2:37:24.900
 But when you go into REM sleep,

2:37:24.900 --> 2:37:27.180
 it is the only time during the 24 hour period

2:37:27.180 --> 2:37:30.020
 where your brain is devoid of any noradrenaline,

2:37:30.020 --> 2:37:31.700
 it is completely shut off.

2:37:31.700 --> 2:37:34.900
 And so the signal to noise ratio is very different.

2:37:34.900 --> 2:37:36.620
 It's almost as though we're injecting

2:37:36.620 --> 2:37:40.180
 a greater amount of noise into the neural architecture

2:37:40.180 --> 2:37:42.420
 of the brain during dream sleep,

2:37:42.420 --> 2:37:45.740
 as if it's chemically brute forced

2:37:45.740 --> 2:37:50.740
 into this relaxed associative memory processing state.

2:37:50.740 --> 2:37:53.140
 And then from an anatomical perspective,

2:37:53.140 --> 2:37:56.180
 just as I described, the prefrontal cortex goes down

2:37:56.180 --> 2:37:58.580
 and other regions light up.

2:37:58.580 --> 2:38:01.660
 So it is a state that seems to be very,

2:38:01.660 --> 2:38:06.420
 I mean, if you were to show me a brain scan of REM sleep

2:38:06.420 --> 2:38:08.820
 and tell me that it's not REM sleep,

2:38:08.820 --> 2:38:11.620
 just say, look, based on the pattern of this brain activity,

2:38:11.620 --> 2:38:14.420
 what would you say is going on in this person's mind?

2:38:14.420 --> 2:38:16.500
 I would say, well, they're probably not rational.

2:38:16.500 --> 2:38:18.140
 They're probably not having logical thought

2:38:18.140 --> 2:38:19.940
 because their prefrontal cortex is down.

2:38:19.940 --> 2:38:21.460
 They're probably feeling very emotional

2:38:21.460 --> 2:38:23.580
 because their amygdala is active,

2:38:23.580 --> 2:38:25.420
 which is an emotional center of the brain.

2:38:25.420 --> 2:38:27.340
 They're definitely going to be thinking visually

2:38:27.340 --> 2:38:30.620
 because the back of the brain is lit up, the visual cortex.

2:38:30.620 --> 2:38:33.900
 It's probably going to be filled with past experience

2:38:33.900 --> 2:38:35.940
 and autobiographical memories

2:38:35.940 --> 2:38:39.540
 because their memory centers are lighting up.

2:38:39.540 --> 2:38:40.820
 And there's probably going to be movement

2:38:40.820 --> 2:38:43.020
 because their motor cortex is very active.

2:38:43.940 --> 2:38:45.940
 That to me sounds very much like a dream.

2:38:45.940 --> 2:38:48.060
 And that's exactly what we see in brain scanners

2:38:48.060 --> 2:38:50.420
 when we've put people inside of them.

2:38:50.420 --> 2:38:54.340
 One of the things I notice sleep affects

2:38:54.340 --> 2:38:59.340
 is my ability to see the beauty in the world.

2:39:00.180 --> 2:39:03.700
 So what do you think is the connection

2:39:03.700 --> 2:39:06.020
 between sleep and your emotional life,

2:39:06.020 --> 2:39:10.540
 your ability to love other human beings and love life?

2:39:10.540 --> 2:39:15.540
 Yeah, I think it's very powerful and strong.

2:39:16.380 --> 2:39:19.020
 So we've done a lot of work in the field

2:39:19.020 --> 2:39:21.540
 of sleep and emotion and sleep and moods.

2:39:21.540 --> 2:39:26.060
 And you can separate your emotions into two main buckets,

2:39:26.060 --> 2:39:28.540
 positive and negative.

2:39:28.540 --> 2:39:32.020
 And what's interesting is that when you are sleep deprived

2:39:32.020 --> 2:39:35.540
 and the more hours that you go into being awake

2:39:35.540 --> 2:39:37.980
 and the fewer hours that you've had to sleep,

2:39:37.980 --> 2:39:42.980
 your negative mood starts to increase.

2:39:43.260 --> 2:39:46.300
 And we know which individual types

2:39:46.300 --> 2:39:48.540
 of emotions are changing.

2:39:48.540 --> 2:39:51.140
 I've got a wonderful postdoc in my lab

2:39:51.140 --> 2:39:53.980
 called Etty Ben Simon, who's doing some incredible work

2:39:53.980 --> 2:39:57.100
 on trying to understand the emotional,

2:39:57.100 --> 2:40:02.100
 individual emotional tapestry of affective,

2:40:02.100 --> 2:40:07.100
 meltdown when you're not getting sufficient sleep.

2:40:07.100 --> 2:40:09.180
 But let's just keep with two dimensions,

2:40:09.180 --> 2:40:10.020
 positive and negative.

2:40:10.020 --> 2:40:10.860
 Yes.

2:40:10.860 --> 2:40:13.460
 Most people would think, well, it's the negative

2:40:13.460 --> 2:40:15.700
 that takes the biggest hit when I'm sleep deprived.

2:40:15.700 --> 2:40:17.020
 It's not.

2:40:17.020 --> 2:40:20.860
 By probably in a log order, magnitude larger

2:40:20.860 --> 2:40:23.900
 is a hit on your positive emotions.

2:40:23.900 --> 2:40:27.860
 In other words, you stop being sleep deprived

2:40:27.860 --> 2:40:32.860
 of positive emotions, in other words, you stop gaining

2:40:32.900 --> 2:40:35.140
 pleasure from normally pleasurable things.

2:40:35.140 --> 2:40:38.420
 And it's a state that we call anhedonia.

2:40:38.420 --> 2:40:43.420
 And anhedonia is the state that we often call depression.

2:40:43.620 --> 2:40:47.300
 So depression to most people's surprise isn't necessarily

2:40:47.300 --> 2:40:52.060
 that you're always feeling negative emotions.

2:40:52.060 --> 2:40:56.780
 It's often more about the fact that you lose the pleasure

2:40:56.780 --> 2:40:58.700
 in the good things in life.

2:40:58.700 --> 2:41:00.620
 That's what we call anhedonia.

2:41:00.620 --> 2:41:03.740
 That's what we see in sleep, an insufficient sleep.

2:41:03.740 --> 2:41:05.540
 And it happens quite quickly.

2:41:05.540 --> 2:41:06.900
 Yeah, it's kind of fascinating.

2:41:06.900 --> 2:41:10.660
 I think I do, it's not depression,

2:41:10.660 --> 2:41:15.180
 but like it's a stroll into that direction,

2:41:15.180 --> 2:41:17.340
 which is when I'm sleep deprived,

2:41:17.340 --> 2:41:20.400
 I stop being able to see the meaning in life.

2:41:21.340 --> 2:41:24.980
 The things that gave me meanings starts to lose meaning.

2:41:24.980 --> 2:41:29.040
 Like it makes me realize how enjoyable everything is

2:41:29.040 --> 2:41:31.420
 in my life because when I start to lose it,

2:41:31.420 --> 2:41:33.600
 when I'm severely sleep deprived,

2:41:33.600 --> 2:41:36.060
 you start to see how much life sucks when you lose it.

2:41:36.060 --> 2:41:38.740
 But that said, I'm just cognizant enough

2:41:38.740 --> 2:41:40.760
 that sleep fixes all of that.

2:41:40.760 --> 2:41:44.140
 So I use those states for what they're worth.

2:41:44.140 --> 2:41:48.860
 In fact, I personally like to pay attention to the things

2:41:48.860 --> 2:41:52.780
 that bother me in doing that time.

2:41:52.780 --> 2:41:56.800
 Cause they also reveal important information to me.

2:41:58.220 --> 2:41:59.500
 That's interesting.

2:41:59.500 --> 2:42:02.220
 I have to use like a Rorschach to, yeah.

2:42:02.220 --> 2:42:05.700
 I mean, there's, so I find this when I fast combine

2:42:05.700 --> 2:42:10.700
 with sleep deprivation, I'm clear to see with people,

2:42:10.700 --> 2:42:12.940
 clear and identifying the things

2:42:12.940 --> 2:42:15.740
 that are not going right in my life

2:42:15.740 --> 2:42:19.100
 or people that I'm working with are not doing

2:42:19.100 --> 2:42:21.140
 as good of a job as they could be doing.

2:42:21.140 --> 2:42:25.940
 Like people that are negative in my life,

2:42:25.940 --> 2:42:28.160
 I'm more able to identify them.

2:42:28.160 --> 2:42:30.020
 So I don't act on that.

2:42:30.020 --> 2:42:32.340
 It's a very bad time to act on those decisions,

2:42:32.340 --> 2:42:36.860
 but I'm like recording that information

2:42:36.860 --> 2:42:40.040
 because I usually, when I'm well rested and happy,

2:42:40.040 --> 2:42:42.040
 I see the beauty in everybody,

2:42:42.040 --> 2:42:44.020
 which can get you into trouble.

2:42:44.020 --> 2:42:46.020
 So you have to balance those two things.

2:42:46.020 --> 2:42:47.340
 But yes, it's fascinating.

2:42:47.340 --> 2:42:50.260
 But there's irony there too, which is the fact that,

2:42:50.260 --> 2:42:51.980
 you know, when you're well rested and well slept,

2:42:51.980 --> 2:42:55.060
 just as you said, you see the beauty in life

2:42:55.060 --> 2:42:56.820
 and it sort of enlivens you

2:42:56.820 --> 2:43:01.580
 and sort of gives you a quality of life

2:43:01.580 --> 2:43:03.760
 that's emotionally very different.

2:43:04.880 --> 2:43:09.880
 Yet then we are contrasting that against the need

2:43:13.300 --> 2:43:15.600
 for not getting enough sleep

2:43:15.600 --> 2:43:17.620
 because of the beautiful things

2:43:17.620 --> 2:43:20.480
 that you want to accomplish in life.

2:43:20.480 --> 2:43:23.860
 And I don't actually see them as,

2:43:25.780 --> 2:43:29.380
 you know, sort of completely counterintuitive

2:43:29.380 --> 2:43:32.740
 or paradoxical because I still think that you can strive

2:43:32.740 --> 2:43:35.560
 for all of the brilliant things that you are striving for,

2:43:35.560 --> 2:43:38.020
 to have the monumental goals,

2:43:38.020 --> 2:43:42.160
 the Herculean challenges that you wish to take on and solve.

2:43:43.480 --> 2:43:46.140
 They can still enthrall you and excite you

2:43:46.140 --> 2:43:48.020
 and stimulate you.

2:43:48.020 --> 2:43:52.060
 But because of the insufficient sleep that they can

2:43:52.060 --> 2:43:55.420
 or that goal can produce,

2:43:55.420 --> 2:43:59.980
 it will shave off the beauty of life

2:43:59.980 --> 2:44:01.300
 that you experience in between.

2:44:01.300 --> 2:44:04.100
 And again, this is just about the trade off.

2:44:04.100 --> 2:44:05.200
 I will say though that,

2:44:05.200 --> 2:44:09.080
 and this is not applicable to your circumstance,

2:44:11.240 --> 2:44:14.380
 we do know that insufficient sleep

2:44:14.380 --> 2:44:18.720
 is very strongly linked to suicide ideation,

2:44:18.720 --> 2:44:22.880
 suicide attempts and tragically suicide completion as well.

2:44:24.160 --> 2:44:28.220
 And in fact, in 20 years of studying sleep,

2:44:28.220 --> 2:44:29.780
 we have not been able to discover

2:44:29.780 --> 2:44:32.880
 a single psychiatric condition in which sleep is normal.

2:44:34.700 --> 2:44:37.380
 And I think that that is a profound,

2:44:37.380 --> 2:44:41.860
 I think it tells us so much about the role of sleep

2:44:41.860 --> 2:44:45.100
 as a potential causal agent in psychiatric conditions.

2:44:45.100 --> 2:44:47.620
 I also think it's a potential sign

2:44:47.620 --> 2:44:50.020
 that we should be using sleep as a tool

2:44:50.020 --> 2:44:52.260
 for the prevention of grave mental illness.

2:44:52.260 --> 2:44:54.900
 Yeah, it's both a cause and a solution.

2:44:54.900 --> 2:44:57.060
 So yeah, I mean, me personally,

2:44:57.060 --> 2:45:01.340
 I've gone through a few dark periods quite recently

2:45:01.340 --> 2:45:06.260
 and it was almost always sleep is not the cause,

2:45:06.260 --> 2:45:10.820
 but sleep is the catalyst from going to a bad time

2:45:10.820 --> 2:45:12.380
 to a very bad time.

2:45:12.380 --> 2:45:13.220
 Yeah.

2:45:13.220 --> 2:45:15.080
 And so it's definitely true.

2:45:15.080 --> 2:45:18.560
 And it's funny how sleep can just cure all of that.

2:45:18.560 --> 2:45:20.080
 There's actually a beautiful quote

2:45:20.080 --> 2:45:24.360
 by an American entrepreneur called E. Joseph Kosman,

2:45:24.360 --> 2:45:26.060
 who once said that the best bridge

2:45:26.060 --> 2:45:29.600
 between despair and hope is a good night's sleep.

2:45:30.780 --> 2:45:35.780
 And I spilled quite so much ink and hundreds of pages

2:45:37.140 --> 2:45:40.220
 in elegantly trying to say the same thing in my book.

2:45:40.220 --> 2:45:43.860
 And he said it in one line and it's beautiful.

2:45:43.860 --> 2:45:45.420
 What do you think is,

2:45:45.420 --> 2:45:47.500
 we've been talking about how to extend this life,

2:45:47.500 --> 2:45:48.940
 how to make it a good life.

2:45:50.140 --> 2:45:53.460
 We've been talking about love.

2:45:53.460 --> 2:45:55.840
 What do you think is the meaning of this whole ride?

2:45:55.840 --> 2:45:56.680
 Of life?

2:45:56.680 --> 2:45:57.500
 Of life.

2:45:57.500 --> 2:46:00.800
 Why do we wanna make it a good one?

2:46:00.800 --> 2:46:01.860
 Do you think there's a meaning?

2:46:01.860 --> 2:46:03.940
 Do you think there's a answer to the why?

2:46:05.700 --> 2:46:06.880
 For me personally,

2:46:06.880 --> 2:46:11.880
 I think the meaning of life is to eat,

2:46:15.120 --> 2:46:20.120
 is to sleep, is to fall in love, is to cry,

2:46:22.840 --> 2:46:23.740
 and then to die.

2:46:27.300 --> 2:46:29.760
 Oh, and probably race cars in between.

2:46:29.760 --> 2:46:30.600
 Race cars.

2:46:30.600 --> 2:46:33.400
 Well, there's a whole topic of sex we didn't talk about.

2:46:33.400 --> 2:46:34.880
 So that's probably in there.

2:46:34.880 --> 2:46:35.720
 Should we do that?

2:46:35.720 --> 2:46:38.920
 Maybe if you'll have me back, I would love to do.

2:46:38.920 --> 2:46:39.760
 I will go around to.

2:46:39.760 --> 2:46:42.760
 Next time we will do another three hours on sex alone.

2:46:42.760 --> 2:46:43.600
 Has it been?

2:46:43.600 --> 2:46:44.440
 Yeah.

2:46:44.440 --> 2:46:46.800
 It has been over three hours.

2:46:46.800 --> 2:46:47.640
 Gosh, okay.

2:46:47.640 --> 2:46:50.320
 Matt, I'm a big fan of your work.

2:46:50.320 --> 2:46:51.960
 I think you're doing really important work.

2:46:51.960 --> 2:46:54.240
 Even despite all the things I've been saying

2:46:54.240 --> 2:46:56.600
 about the madness of my own sleep schedule,

2:46:56.600 --> 2:46:58.720
 I think you're helping millions of people.

2:46:58.720 --> 2:47:02.280
 So it's an honor that you spend your valuable time with me

2:47:02.280 --> 2:47:05.760
 and I can't wait until your podcast comes out.

2:47:05.760 --> 2:47:08.280
 I'm a huge fan of podcasts, I'm a huge fan of you,

2:47:08.280 --> 2:47:10.840
 and it's just an honor to know you

2:47:10.840 --> 2:47:12.520
 and to get a chance, hopefully in the future,

2:47:12.520 --> 2:47:13.760
 to work together with you.

2:47:13.760 --> 2:47:17.360
 You're a brilliant man and you're doing amazing things.

2:47:17.360 --> 2:47:22.240
 And I feel immensely honored to have met you,

2:47:22.240 --> 2:47:25.880
 to now know you, and to start calling you a friend.

2:47:25.880 --> 2:47:27.680
 Thank you for what you do for the world

2:47:27.680 --> 2:47:32.320
 and for me included.

2:47:32.320 --> 2:47:33.160
 Thank you, Matt.

2:47:33.160 --> 2:47:34.640
 Take care.

2:47:34.640 --> 2:47:37.080
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Matt Walker

2:47:37.080 --> 2:47:40.720
 and thank you to Stamps.com, Squarespace,

2:47:40.720 --> 2:47:43.560
 Letter Greens, BetterHelp, and Onnit.

2:47:43.560 --> 2:47:46.960
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

2:47:46.960 --> 2:47:49.160
 And now, let me leave you with some words

2:47:49.160 --> 2:47:52.280
 from Nikola Tesla, who we discussed in this podcast

2:47:52.280 --> 2:47:54.120
 as sleeping very few hours a night.

2:47:54.120 --> 2:47:57.600
 All that was great in the past was ridiculed,

2:47:57.600 --> 2:48:00.160
 condemned, combated, and suppressed,

2:48:00.160 --> 2:48:02.760
 only to emerge all the more powerfully,

2:48:02.760 --> 2:48:05.440
 all the more triumphantly from the struggle.

2:48:05.440 --> 2:48:24.440
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
