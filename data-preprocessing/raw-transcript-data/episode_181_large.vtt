00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
 The following is a conversation with Sergei Nazarov,

00:03.040 --> 00:07.360
 CEO of Chainlink, which is a decentralized Oracle network

00:07.360 --> 00:10.040
 that provides data to smart contracts.

00:10.040 --> 00:12.760
 He and his team have done seminal research

00:12.760 --> 00:15.320
 and engineering in the space of smart contracts.

00:15.320 --> 00:17.420
 Check out the Chainlink 2.0 white paper

00:17.420 --> 00:19.380
 that I found to be a great overview

00:19.380 --> 00:21.320
 of their technology and vision.

00:21.320 --> 00:24.700
 It's 136 pages, but very accessible.

00:24.700 --> 00:26.760
 Quick mention of our sponsors.

00:26.760 --> 00:30.920
 Wine Access, Athletic Greens, Magic Spoon, Indeed,

00:30.920 --> 00:32.080
 and BetterHelp.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.480
 Check them out in the description

00:33.480 --> 00:35.400
 to support this podcast.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.180
 As a side note, let me say that

00:37.180 --> 00:39.560
 externally connected smart contracts

00:39.560 --> 00:42.320
 that combine the ocean of data out there

00:42.320 --> 00:45.640
 with the security of the blockchain are fascinating to me,

00:45.640 --> 00:48.240
 both technically and philosophically.

00:48.240 --> 00:51.960
 Data is knowledge, and knowledge is power.

00:51.960 --> 00:55.120
 I think the more reliable data sources we integrate

00:55.120 --> 00:57.520
 into our decision making,

00:57.520 --> 01:00.880
 especially when those decisions are executed by programs,

01:00.880 --> 01:04.460
 the more efficient and productive our decisions become.

01:04.460 --> 01:07.440
 There are interactions between humans

01:07.440 --> 01:10.040
 that should not be formalized digitally,

01:10.040 --> 01:13.680
 like love, for example, but for all the others,

01:13.680 --> 01:15.660
 there's no reason for smart contracts

01:15.660 --> 01:18.820
 not to automate away the menial parts of life,

01:18.820 --> 01:22.920
 making more room for good conversation over brisket

01:22.920 --> 01:26.760
 and maybe some vodka with old and new friends.

01:26.760 --> 01:28.960
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast,

01:28.960 --> 01:32.680
 and here is my conversation with Sergey Nazarov.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.360
 Is that Jozsik there?

01:35.360 --> 01:38.360
 So I gave away everything I own a few times in my life,

01:38.360 --> 01:41.000
 and he accidentally survived,

01:41.000 --> 01:42.660
 and I don't like stuffed animals.

01:42.660 --> 01:44.800
 What I really liked about, I got him in a thrift store.

01:44.800 --> 01:45.960
 What I liked about him is,

01:45.960 --> 01:48.040
 because I'd never seen a stuffed animal

01:48.040 --> 01:50.560
 that looks pissed off at life.

01:50.560 --> 01:53.400
 Like they're usually smiling in the dumbest of ways,

01:53.400 --> 01:56.080
 and this guy was just pissed.

01:56.080 --> 01:58.960
 Yeah, I gotta tell you, that's actually pretty funny.

01:58.960 --> 01:59.920
 I like this guy.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.680
 If you had to live only in the digital world

02:02.680 --> 02:06.120
 or the physical world, which would you choose?

02:06.120 --> 02:08.560
 So I think this is actually a question

02:08.560 --> 02:11.720
 more about what the fidelity of the digital world would be

02:11.720 --> 02:13.360
 versus the physical world.

02:13.360 --> 02:15.200
 I think this type of question,

02:15.200 --> 02:18.200
 this whole simulation thing actually comes from papers

02:18.200 --> 02:21.280
 about 20, 30 years ago in the philosophical world

02:21.280 --> 02:23.720
 where people tried to make this thought experiment

02:23.720 --> 02:25.500
 of would you be comfortable

02:25.500 --> 02:27.340
 if everything that was happening to you

02:27.340 --> 02:28.980
 happened in a simulation?

02:28.980 --> 02:29.920
 What they were trying to do

02:29.920 --> 02:32.640
 is they were intuitively trying to understand

02:32.640 --> 02:36.980
 is there some kind of intuitive personal connection

02:36.980 --> 02:40.360
 we have to something being the real world, right?

02:40.360 --> 02:43.080
 And then the Matrix movie actually came out of these papers,

02:43.080 --> 02:45.760
 and then these ideas made their way

02:45.760 --> 02:47.940
 into the public consciousness.

02:47.940 --> 02:50.480
 I personally think that if I had the choice

02:50.480 --> 02:53.120
 to be in the digital world at the same fidelity

02:53.120 --> 02:56.080
 as the real world with immortality,

02:56.080 --> 02:57.560
 I would absolutely go with the digital.

02:57.560 --> 02:58.640
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:58.640 --> 03:00.440
 How'd you add the immortality part?

03:00.440 --> 03:02.680
 That's a, you don't get immortality.

03:02.680 --> 03:03.920
 If you think about how we would go

03:03.920 --> 03:04.920
 into the digital world, right?

03:04.920 --> 03:07.440
 Our brain patterns would be mapped

03:07.440 --> 03:10.880
 onto some kind of probably virtual machine, right?

03:10.880 --> 03:13.040
 And that would mean immortality, right?

03:13.040 --> 03:15.220
 Because the virtual machine has no limit

03:15.220 --> 03:16.060
 to how long it can exist.

03:16.060 --> 03:18.480
 So don't you think there'll be like a versioning system?

03:18.480 --> 03:22.040
 Like there'll be, this is a soft fork

03:22.040 --> 03:23.740
 versus hard fork question.

03:23.740 --> 03:27.160
 Whether Sergei version 2.0 would be different

03:27.160 --> 03:30.600
 from Sergei version 1.0, there'll be an upgrade.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.040
 So that's a mortality.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.040
 Sergei 1.0 would die in the digital world.

03:34.040 --> 03:38.060
 And you get like a software update, and then that's it.

03:38.940 --> 03:41.340
 Well, yeah, when people go into the Star Trek transporter,

03:41.340 --> 03:43.640
 are they killed or are they transported?

03:43.640 --> 03:45.060
 I don't really know.

03:45.060 --> 03:46.520
 I haven't written any papers on this.

03:46.520 --> 03:48.040
 I haven't really thought about it too much.

03:48.040 --> 03:50.040
 There's no white paper on the transporter.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.240
 Not at this point, so.

03:51.240 --> 03:53.720
 Well, what does fidelity mean exactly to you?

03:53.720 --> 03:58.040
 Is it like strictly, so the fidelity of the physics world,

03:58.040 --> 04:01.780
 the physical world is maybe now questions of physics,

04:01.780 --> 04:05.320
 quantum mechanics, what is at the bottom of it all?

04:05.320 --> 04:07.640
 Or do you mean the fidelity of the actual experience?

04:07.640 --> 04:09.400
 Like the original state? It's just perception.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.400
 It's just perception.

04:11.400 --> 04:14.280
 But that's limited by human cognitive capabilities.

04:14.280 --> 04:16.160
 It is, but I don't really have anything else, right?

04:16.160 --> 04:17.280
 I think all of these papers

04:17.280 --> 04:19.100
 that brought up these questions of assimilation,

04:19.100 --> 04:21.600
 they were like in epistemology and metaphysics.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.840
 And what they were trying to do, I think,

04:23.840 --> 04:25.080
 was they were trying to put people

04:25.080 --> 04:26.440
 through a thought experiment

04:26.440 --> 04:28.840
 where they would come out on the other end

04:28.840 --> 04:33.120
 and say the reality of life is really worth something.

04:33.120 --> 04:36.140
 And I don't, you know, ignorance isn't bliss,

04:36.140 --> 04:38.600
 which is that consistent statement in the matrix, right?

04:38.600 --> 04:40.880
 Ignorance is bliss is that that's what one of the guys says

04:40.880 --> 04:42.520
 when he's like, you know, doing something wrong

04:42.520 --> 04:44.280
 and trying to get back into the matrix.

04:44.280 --> 04:46.600
 And the question is, is ignorance bliss?

04:47.720 --> 04:49.840
 And it's like a different version of that.

04:49.840 --> 04:52.480
 I think from a perceptual point of view,

04:52.480 --> 04:55.660
 if my perceptions aren't in any way different,

04:55.660 --> 04:59.580
 so fidelity is very good, it doesn't matter.

04:59.580 --> 05:00.960
 I don't know, right?

05:00.960 --> 05:04.880
 So if I don't know something, it doesn't really exist.

05:04.880 --> 05:07.800
 And if it doesn't exist in my perception

05:07.800 --> 05:09.840
 or my consciousness, then it doesn't exist,

05:09.840 --> 05:11.680
 period, for me, at least.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.560
 And then whether it exists in some, you know,

05:13.560 --> 05:16.380
 more metaphysical version of things,

05:16.380 --> 05:18.800
 I personally never really got into the metaphysics stuff

05:18.800 --> 05:20.300
 because I could never really,

05:21.960 --> 05:24.920
 I couldn't understand what the point of it was, right?

05:24.920 --> 05:27.840
 It's one of these things where I couldn't really get

05:27.840 --> 05:32.320
 what the practical application of it was.

05:32.320 --> 05:34.580
 And this is from those realm of questions, right?

05:34.580 --> 05:37.040
 Like if there was something about the world,

05:37.040 --> 05:39.820
 but you didn't have a capacity to perceive it,

05:39.820 --> 05:41.760
 would it matter to you?

05:41.760 --> 05:43.140
 To me, it wouldn't matter.

05:43.140 --> 05:45.440
 Right, to me, by the way, the simulation thing

05:45.440 --> 05:47.760
 is a really interesting engineering question,

05:47.760 --> 05:52.760
 which is how difficult is it to engineer a virtual reality,

05:53.140 --> 05:57.600
 a digital world that is sufficiently of high fidelity

05:57.600 --> 05:59.080
 where you would want to live in it?

05:59.080 --> 06:01.400
 I think that's a really testable

06:01.400 --> 06:03.240
 and a fascinating engineering question.

06:03.240 --> 06:04.440
 So my intuition says like,

06:04.440 --> 06:06.540
 it's not as difficult as we think.

06:06.540 --> 06:10.080
 It's not nearly as difficult as having to create

06:10.080 --> 06:12.400
 a quantum mechanical simulation that's large enough

06:12.400 --> 06:14.120
 to capture the full human experience.

06:14.120 --> 06:15.880
 Like it might be just as simple

06:15.880 --> 06:18.760
 as just a really nice quake game,

06:19.760 --> 06:20.960
 like with a nice engine,

06:20.960 --> 06:24.480
 with just creating all the basic visual elements

06:24.480 --> 06:28.040
 that trick our cognitive, our visual cortex

06:28.040 --> 06:29.540
 into believing that we're actually

06:29.540 --> 06:31.720
 in the physical environment.

06:31.720 --> 06:34.280
 And I think that if that's true,

06:34.280 --> 06:38.440
 then that's quite a high fidelity digital world

06:38.440 --> 06:41.620
 is actually achievable within a century.

06:42.640 --> 06:44.860
 And that changes things.

06:44.860 --> 06:47.000
 Yeah, yeah, maybe in our lifetime.

06:47.000 --> 06:47.840
 I'm really hoping for that.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.840
 I'm hoping somebody can copy my brainwaves

06:49.840 --> 06:54.380
 onto a virtual machine and allow that consciousness

06:54.380 --> 06:55.760
 to continue to exist.

06:55.760 --> 06:59.040
 Whether that's death or not, I don't know.

06:59.040 --> 07:03.360
 But I think it's actually gonna require some serious leaps.

07:03.360 --> 07:05.580
 Like even the VR headsets, right?

07:05.580 --> 07:09.440
 They don't work if they go below 90 frame rates, right?

07:09.440 --> 07:11.200
 People start getting freaked out.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.820
 So you have to go from one gaming screen

07:13.820 --> 07:16.960
 of 60 frames per second

07:16.960 --> 07:19.360
 to two screens of 90 frames per second.

07:19.360 --> 07:22.280
 And so people's hardware today can't even handle that.

07:22.280 --> 07:26.720
 And that's for these two little screens by your eyeballs.

07:26.720 --> 07:30.200
 What it's gonna take to completely trick my consciousness

07:30.200 --> 07:31.560
 into not knowing the difference

07:31.560 --> 07:34.500
 in terms of like all the sensory inputs.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.880
 I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

07:37.880 --> 07:41.280
 Whoever does that and is close to doing that,

07:41.280 --> 07:42.680
 they should contact me.

07:42.680 --> 07:46.920
 I want to have my brainwaves turned into a virtual machine.

07:46.920 --> 07:50.240
 Would you in that context, if Morpheus came to you,

07:50.240 --> 07:53.500
 would you take the blue pill or the red pill?

07:53.500 --> 07:58.280
 Meaning, would you be happy just living in that world

07:58.280 --> 08:02.240
 and not knowing that you're living inside that virtual world

08:02.240 --> 08:03.800
 that's running a computer?

08:03.800 --> 08:06.640
 Or would you want to know the truth of it?

08:06.640 --> 08:08.600
 Well, actually I think that's a very different question,

08:08.600 --> 08:09.440
 right?

08:09.440 --> 08:12.520
 There's a actually moral ethical question there

08:12.520 --> 08:15.120
 about whether you should allow a bunch of people

08:15.120 --> 08:17.960
 to get manipulated and killed and slaved,

08:17.960 --> 08:20.200
 because in the matrix they're all enslaved

08:20.200 --> 08:23.280
 as like a AAA battery

08:23.280 --> 08:25.580
 to turn a human being into the battery, right?

08:25.580 --> 08:30.580
 So I think the moral and ethical question of that,

08:31.540 --> 08:33.100
 fascinating enough, isn't actually different

08:33.100 --> 08:35.380
 than the moral and ethical questions we face today

08:35.380 --> 08:36.940
 in modern daily life.

08:36.940 --> 08:39.560
 But I probably have given the choice

08:39.560 --> 08:43.460
 of just completely going along or going against it.

08:43.460 --> 08:45.360
 I would probably go against it

08:45.360 --> 08:48.020
 if I had to make this kind of binary choice.

08:48.020 --> 08:50.000
 Because going along with it,

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
 I think at that scale of scary stuff happening to people

08:56.840 --> 09:00.000
 is probably something really, really, really difficult.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.200
 But for your individual life,

09:01.200 --> 09:03.240
 it's way more fun to go along with it.

09:03.240 --> 09:08.240
 So you're saying you value the opposing a system

09:09.200 --> 09:11.760
 that includes the suffering of others

09:11.760 --> 09:15.840
 versus just for yourself enjoying the ride.

09:15.840 --> 09:19.400
 I mean, if there is such a binary choice,

09:19.400 --> 09:21.900
 why choose to oppose the system?

09:21.900 --> 09:24.440
 I think it's the nature of kind of the ethical dilemma

09:24.440 --> 09:26.040
 that you face in that situation.

09:26.040 --> 09:27.560
 There's kind of some,

09:27.560 --> 09:29.880
 this is obviously not something that's happening now, right?

09:29.880 --> 09:31.320
 We don't know this, right?

09:31.320 --> 09:33.080
 No, we don't know this.

09:33.080 --> 09:34.920
 At the end of the day,

09:34.920 --> 09:38.080
 at that scale of something like that happening,

09:38.080 --> 09:43.080
 yeah, that scale of people being manipulated and harmed,

09:43.560 --> 09:45.760
 then I think pretty much almost all people

09:45.760 --> 09:49.600
 have an obligation to go against it.

09:49.600 --> 09:53.620
 Probably that's what that looks like in my opinion.

09:53.620 --> 09:57.660
 So you've talked about the concept of definitive truth.

09:57.660 --> 09:58.500
 What is it?

09:58.500 --> 10:00.320
 And in general, what is the nature of truth

10:00.320 --> 10:01.820
 in human civilization?

10:01.820 --> 10:04.900
 And just talking about the digital age,

10:05.880 --> 10:08.100
 the nature of truth in the digital age.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.600
 So the interesting thing about definitive truth

10:11.600 --> 10:14.800
 is that it actually exists on this,

10:14.800 --> 10:16.840
 at least in my mind on this spectrum

10:16.840 --> 10:21.320
 between objective truth and just somebody made something up

10:21.320 --> 10:22.840
 and nobody else agrees.

10:22.840 --> 10:25.000
 So what I think definitive truth is,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.120
 is it's somewhere in the middle on that spectrum

10:27.120 --> 10:31.880
 where if you and me define what truth is, right?

10:31.880 --> 10:34.280
 Like if you and me have an agreement of some kind

10:34.280 --> 10:38.620
 and we say, as long as the weather is sunny

10:38.620 --> 10:41.640
 or the weather isn't, there is no rain on that day,

10:41.640 --> 10:44.480
 then there'll be an insurance policy that results

10:44.480 --> 10:47.920
 and you and me both agree that as long as three sensors,

10:47.920 --> 10:51.520
 three weather monitoring stations all say that,

10:51.520 --> 10:54.780
 then the definitive truth for us and for that agreement

10:54.780 --> 10:59.520
 is the result of those systems coming to consensus

10:59.520 --> 11:01.960
 about what happened out in the real world.

11:01.960 --> 11:06.080
 I think the objective truth definition

11:06.080 --> 11:08.160
 from kind of the philosophical world

11:08.160 --> 11:12.160
 is really, really stringent and very, very hard to attain.

11:12.160 --> 11:14.000
 And that's not what this is.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.280
 And that's actually not what commerce

11:16.280 --> 11:20.180
 or the ability for people to interact about contracts needs.

11:20.180 --> 11:23.980
 What I think the world of commerce needs is an upgrade

11:23.980 --> 11:28.680
 from someone can unilaterally decide what the truth is

11:28.680 --> 11:33.680
 to there can be a pre agreed set of conditions

11:34.240 --> 11:37.920
 where we define what the truth is under those conditions.

11:37.920 --> 11:40.620
 And then you and me basically say,

11:40.620 --> 11:43.640
 if these 20 nodes or of these 30 data sources

11:43.640 --> 11:46.440
 come to consensus within this method of consensus

11:46.440 --> 11:48.280
 with this threshold of agreement,

11:48.280 --> 11:51.240
 then definitive truth has been achieved for you and me

11:51.240 --> 11:54.360
 in our relationship for this specific agreement

11:54.360 --> 11:58.200
 and the specificity and our shared agreement

11:58.200 --> 12:01.480
 to that kind of truth or that definitive truth

12:01.480 --> 12:05.000
 being acceptable to both of us is probably

12:05.000 --> 12:08.200
 what's kind of necessary and sufficient

12:08.200 --> 12:10.600
 for everything to move forward in a better way.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.640
 In any case, much better than,

12:12.640 --> 12:14.440
 I'm a bank or an insurance company,

12:14.440 --> 12:16.800
 I'm gonna unilaterally decide what happens.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.720
 It's definitely an upgrade from that.

12:18.720 --> 12:21.880
 Do you think it's possible to define formally in this way,

12:21.880 --> 12:24.360
 a definitive truth for many things in this world?

12:24.360 --> 12:26.240
 Like you talked about weather,

12:26.240 --> 12:30.380
 basically defining that if three sensors of weather agree,

12:30.380 --> 12:33.320
 then that we're going to agree that that is a definitive,

12:33.320 --> 12:36.640
 useful truth for us to operate under.

12:36.640 --> 12:39.360
 So how many things in this world

12:39.360 --> 12:41.800
 can be formalized in this way, do you think?

12:41.800 --> 12:43.240
 A huge amount.

12:43.240 --> 12:48.240
 So there's actually two things going on here.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.840
 One thing is the amount of data that already exists

12:51.840 --> 12:55.400
 and the pieces of data coming off of markets,

12:55.400 --> 12:59.200
 IOT, shipment of goods, any number of other things.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.600
 Like even your YouTube channel has a certain amount

13:01.600 --> 13:03.840
 of likes or a certain amount of clicks

13:03.840 --> 13:05.200
 or a certain amount of views

13:05.200 --> 13:06.560
 and even that's quantifiable.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.980
 So even to a certain degree, what we do here today,

13:08.980 --> 13:11.680
 you and me right now can be quantified

13:11.680 --> 13:13.800
 as far as the amount of views, the amount of clicks,

13:13.800 --> 13:14.640
 the amount of any number of other things.

13:14.640 --> 13:18.320
 Yeah, you, the viewer, have power of data in your hands

13:18.320 --> 13:20.660
 by clicking like or dislike right now

13:20.660 --> 13:23.320
 or the subscribe button or the unsubscribe button,

13:23.320 --> 13:24.940
 which I encourage you to do.

13:24.940 --> 13:27.280
 Anyway, okay, so there's data flowing

13:27.280 --> 13:30.280
 into all interactions in this world, there's data.

13:30.280 --> 13:31.640
 There's more and more data, right?

13:31.640 --> 13:32.480
 More and more data.

13:32.480 --> 13:33.300
 More and more data.

13:33.300 --> 13:36.420
 That data is more and more accessible to everybody

13:36.420 --> 13:39.120
 and that accessibility and the fact that there's more of it

13:39.120 --> 13:42.840
 means we can form more definitive truth proofs.

13:42.840 --> 13:44.400
 We can form more and more proofs

13:44.400 --> 13:47.520
 and as we form those proofs, well, we can provide them

13:47.520 --> 13:49.880
 to these blockchains and smart contract systems

13:49.880 --> 13:52.600
 that consume them and then they're tamper proof, right?

13:52.600 --> 13:54.280
 So they can't be manipulated.

13:54.280 --> 13:57.160
 And so now we've combined a system that can prove things

13:57.160 --> 14:00.120
 with a system that guarantees a certain outcomes

14:00.120 --> 14:02.440
 and we have a better system of contracts,

14:02.440 --> 14:06.680
 which is actually an unbelievably powerful tool

14:06.680 --> 14:08.560
 that has never existed before.

14:08.560 --> 14:11.480
 Can we talk about the world of commerce and finance,

14:11.480 --> 14:13.200
 decentralized finance?

14:13.200 --> 14:16.480
 What is it, what's its promise

14:16.480 --> 14:20.200
 from both the philosophical and technical perspective?

14:20.200 --> 14:22.100
 If we just zoom in on that particular space

14:22.100 --> 14:24.080
 of the digital world.

14:24.080 --> 14:28.160
 Sure, so the decentralized finance is the instantiation

14:28.160 --> 14:31.360
 of a specific type of smart contract, right?

14:31.360 --> 14:33.680
 Or what I call hybrid smart contracts,

14:33.680 --> 14:36.500
 which are these contracts that combine the on chain code

14:36.500 --> 14:40.200
 together with the off chain proofs that something happened.

14:40.200 --> 14:41.040
 They're called a hybrid

14:41.040 --> 14:43.880
 because they basically use both of these systems, right?

14:43.880 --> 14:47.040
 The blockchain and the proofs about what happened.

14:47.040 --> 14:51.080
 And what DeFi is, is one specific type

14:51.080 --> 14:53.680
 of hybrid smart contract that is taking

14:53.680 --> 14:57.880
 on the contractual agreements you traditionally find

14:57.880 --> 15:01.340
 in the global financial system, right?

15:01.340 --> 15:04.400
 And that's basically the world of lending,

15:04.400 --> 15:05.920
 the world of yield generation

15:05.920 --> 15:08.800
 for people giving me or giving whoever their money

15:08.800 --> 15:11.680
 and somebody giving back them yield back to them,

15:11.680 --> 15:13.960
 which is what bonds do and what treasuries do

15:13.960 --> 15:16.120
 and what a lot of the global financial markets do,

15:16.120 --> 15:20.360
 as well as the ability to gain exposure and protection

15:20.360 --> 15:23.000
 from different types of events and risks.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.760
 That's a lot of what derivatives do, right?

15:24.760 --> 15:27.520
 Derivatives allow us to say, hey, something's gonna happen.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.520
 And I'm either gonna protect myself

15:29.520 --> 15:31.040
 by getting paid if it happens,

15:31.040 --> 15:33.280
 or I'm going to benefit from it happening

15:33.280 --> 15:34.960
 by basically saying it's gonna happen,

15:34.960 --> 15:36.120
 putting money down on that,

15:36.120 --> 15:38.840
 and that prediction will get me a return.

15:38.840 --> 15:41.640
 Now, that's a very large part

15:41.640 --> 15:43.120
 of the global financial system,

15:43.120 --> 15:45.100
 excluding all the stuff for global trade

15:45.100 --> 15:46.480
 and letters of credit and all the stuff

15:46.480 --> 15:48.320
 that facilitates international trade.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.920
 So excluding that at least for now.

15:50.920 --> 15:53.560
 So if we look at what decentralized finance does,

15:53.560 --> 15:55.280
 it takes all of those agreements

15:55.280 --> 15:57.420
 about generating yield, lending,

15:57.420 --> 15:59.860
 and all of these types of things you find in global finance

15:59.860 --> 16:01.180
 and the world of derivatives

16:01.180 --> 16:04.080
 and a few other types of financial products.

16:04.080 --> 16:07.960
 And it basically puts them into a different format, right?

16:07.960 --> 16:11.700
 So the format you have for centralized financial agreements

16:11.700 --> 16:13.360
 is that you go to a bank,

16:13.360 --> 16:14.280
 even if you're a hedge fund,

16:14.280 --> 16:15.920
 even if you're like the richest people,

16:15.920 --> 16:18.600
 you go to a bank, they make a product for you,

16:18.600 --> 16:20.180
 and you hope that they honor

16:20.180 --> 16:21.760
 the product that they made for you.

16:21.760 --> 16:23.420
 Or you do a deal with another hedge fund

16:23.420 --> 16:25.580
 or whoever, some counterparty,

16:25.580 --> 16:28.440
 and you hope that that deal is honored.

16:28.440 --> 16:29.280
 Yep.

16:29.280 --> 16:32.840
 And then a number of very freaky things start to take place.

16:32.840 --> 16:36.700
 One of them is people don't have clarity

16:36.700 --> 16:38.880
 about what the agreement is, right?

16:38.880 --> 16:41.160
 So a lot of people don't know exactly

16:41.160 --> 16:44.980
 what the agreement is between those parties

16:44.980 --> 16:46.860
 because they can't actually see it.

16:46.860 --> 16:48.860
 Sometimes agreements are kept very private

16:48.860 --> 16:50.440
 or parts of them are kept private.

16:50.440 --> 16:53.040
 And that keeps other counterparties,

16:53.040 --> 16:53.880
 other people in the system

16:53.880 --> 16:55.540
 from understanding what's going on.

16:55.540 --> 16:56.960
 This is actually partly what happened

16:56.960 --> 16:58.200
 with the mortgage crisis.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.560
 The mortgage crisis in 2008 was basically,

17:00.560 --> 17:02.720
 there were a lot of agreements, there were a lot of assets,

17:02.720 --> 17:05.160
 but because the centralized financial system

17:05.160 --> 17:07.000
 worked in such an opaque way,

17:07.000 --> 17:08.600
 it was so unbelievably difficult

17:08.600 --> 17:11.080
 to understand what was going on, right?

17:11.080 --> 17:12.680
 And so that lack of understanding

17:12.680 --> 17:13.840
 for the global financial system

17:13.840 --> 17:15.400
 basically led to a big boom,

17:15.400 --> 17:18.860
 and then correspondingly, very, very big bust,

17:18.860 --> 17:21.280
 which amazingly enough had a huge impact on everybody,

17:21.280 --> 17:22.480
 even though they didn't participate

17:22.480 --> 17:25.360
 in the boom part of the equation.

17:25.360 --> 17:28.680
 In any case, what decentralized finance does

17:28.680 --> 17:31.520
 is it takes these financial contracts

17:31.520 --> 17:33.320
 that power the global financial system,

17:33.320 --> 17:36.240
 it puts them in this new blockchain based format

17:36.240 --> 17:37.400
 that basically at this point

17:37.400 --> 17:39.880
 provides three very powerful things.

17:39.880 --> 17:42.380
 The first thing that it provides is complete transparency

17:42.380 --> 17:45.340
 over what's going on with your financial product.

17:45.340 --> 17:47.120
 So this means when you use a financial product

17:47.120 --> 17:50.240
 in the DeFi format, you, and you as a technical person

17:50.240 --> 17:53.240
 actually can drill down very, very, very deeply,

17:53.240 --> 17:56.000
 and you can understand where the collateral is,

17:56.000 --> 17:57.740
 you can understand how much collateral there is,

17:57.740 --> 17:59.280
 you can understand what format it's in,

17:59.280 --> 18:00.680
 you can understand how it's changing,

18:00.680 --> 18:03.480
 you can understand this on a second to second

18:03.480 --> 18:05.340
 or block to block basis, right?

18:05.340 --> 18:07.840
 So you have complete transparency

18:07.840 --> 18:11.160
 into what's going on in the financial protocol

18:11.160 --> 18:12.840
 that you have your assets in,

18:12.840 --> 18:15.680
 which is because blockchains and the infrastructure,

18:15.680 --> 18:19.760
 all of these things are built on, force that transparency.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.300
 Whereas the centralized financial system

18:21.300 --> 18:23.480
 is very, very good at hiding it.

18:23.480 --> 18:24.920
 It's very good at hiding it

18:24.920 --> 18:27.840
 and packaging things in a glossy wrapper,

18:27.840 --> 18:30.360
 creating a boom, then a bust.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.600
 The centralized finance is built on infrastructure

18:32.600 --> 18:35.880
 that forces transparency such that everyone can understand

18:35.880 --> 18:38.120
 what the financial product does from day one.

18:38.120 --> 18:41.760
 And in fact, escaping that property is practically impossible

18:41.760 --> 18:43.400
 or if someone tries to escape it,

18:43.400 --> 18:44.760
 it becomes immediately obvious

18:44.760 --> 18:46.720
 and people don't use their financial product.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.640
 So that's number one.

18:48.640 --> 18:50.700
 Number two is control.

18:50.700 --> 18:53.160
 So if you look at what happened with Robinhood,

18:53.160 --> 18:55.560
 everybody thought the system worked a certain way, right?

18:55.560 --> 18:57.760
 Everybody thought I have a brokerage account,

18:57.760 --> 19:02.320
 I can trade things under a certain set of market conditions.

19:02.320 --> 19:05.480
 And then the market conditions changed

19:05.480 --> 19:08.280
 within the band of what people thought they could do.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.320
 And everybody was fascinated to find out that,

19:10.320 --> 19:13.440
 oh my God, I thought my band of market conditions

19:13.440 --> 19:15.960
 in which I can control my assets is X,

19:15.960 --> 19:17.520
 but it is actually Y,

19:17.520 --> 19:20.480
 is actually much, much smaller band.

19:20.480 --> 19:22.840
 And the reason it is a much, much smaller

19:22.840 --> 19:24.460
 group of market conditions

19:24.460 --> 19:26.800
 is that the system doesn't work

19:26.800 --> 19:28.200
 the way people think it works.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.320
 The system was wrapped up in a nice glossy wrapper

19:30.320 --> 19:32.860
 and given to them to get them to participate in the system

19:32.860 --> 19:35.840
 because the system requires and needs their participation.

19:35.840 --> 19:39.520
 But if you actually look at how the system works underneath,

19:39.520 --> 19:41.100
 you will see that it does not work

19:41.100 --> 19:43.240
 the way people think that it works.

19:43.240 --> 19:45.560
 And this is actually another reason that DeFi is so powerful

19:45.560 --> 19:49.320
 because DeFi actually, and these blockchain contracts,

19:49.320 --> 19:52.080
 give people the version of the world

19:52.080 --> 19:54.100
 they think they already have,

19:54.100 --> 19:56.520
 which is why they don't beg for it, right?

19:56.520 --> 19:58.360
 So everybody thinks they're in a certain version

19:58.360 --> 20:00.460
 of the world that works in this reliable way,

20:00.460 --> 20:02.800
 transparent way, they're not.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.000
 They don't realize it.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.580
 And so they're confused when you tell them,

20:05.580 --> 20:07.140
 I'm gonna make the world work this way

20:07.140 --> 20:09.180
 because they think they're already in that world.

20:09.180 --> 20:12.020
 But then things like Robinhood make it immediately,

20:12.020 --> 20:14.020
 painfully clear that that's not how the world works

20:14.020 --> 20:17.120
 so that the second real property of DeFi is control,

20:17.120 --> 20:20.240
 which means that you control your assets,

20:20.240 --> 20:23.880
 not a bank, not a broker, not a third party, you.

20:23.880 --> 20:25.000
 You control your Bitcoins,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.320
 you control your tokens in the finance protocol.

20:27.320 --> 20:30.240
 If you don't like how something's going in that protocol,

20:30.240 --> 20:32.820
 you can remove it, you can send it to another protocol,

20:32.820 --> 20:34.480
 or you can use a feature of the protocol

20:34.480 --> 20:36.020
 to do something it's supposed to do.

20:36.020 --> 20:36.860
 And guess what?

20:36.860 --> 20:38.900
 Nobody can just say, oops, that feature,

20:38.900 --> 20:41.280
 that isn't so good for my friends over here.

20:41.280 --> 20:42.520
 That feature is actually,

20:42.520 --> 20:45.520
 we're just gonna pause that feature in the critical moment

20:45.520 --> 20:49.480
 when you need it to execute your strategy,

20:49.480 --> 20:52.120
 which is why you took all the risks to begin with.

20:52.120 --> 20:56.520
 And then the final reason, the final thing to know about DeFi

20:56.520 --> 20:59.200
 is that DeFi is inherently global,

20:59.200 --> 21:02.960
 and actually right now provides better yield globally.

21:02.960 --> 21:05.680
 So if you go to a bank right now with the US dollar,

21:05.680 --> 21:07.840
 you get 1% or less.

21:07.840 --> 21:12.760
 If you go to DeFi with the US dollar, you get 7% or 8%.

21:12.760 --> 21:16.620
 So if we think about that in a world

21:16.620 --> 21:19.120
 where there's a lot of inflation coming down the road,

21:19.120 --> 21:24.120
 and we think about, well, a lot more systems

21:24.120 --> 21:25.440
 might be failing soon,

21:25.440 --> 21:28.280
 and they might be highlighting these types of problems

21:28.280 --> 21:32.240
 that were there for, or as a result of the type of control

21:32.240 --> 21:34.640
 that you see in Robinhood,

21:34.640 --> 21:37.240
 and people are more and more concerned

21:37.240 --> 21:39.960
 about both transparency and control,

21:39.960 --> 21:43.040
 and they're looking for yield to combat inflation.

21:43.040 --> 21:46.780
 I think that's what DeFi is about in a practical sense.

21:46.780 --> 21:48.880
 It is this clarity about your risk.

21:48.880 --> 21:51.360
 It is control over your assets.

21:51.360 --> 21:53.620
 And amazingly, at the same time

21:53.620 --> 21:56.800
 as having those two unbelievably useful properties,

21:56.800 --> 21:59.240
 it is actually superior yield,

21:59.240 --> 22:03.060
 which just leads me to the very obvious conclusion

22:03.060 --> 22:05.920
 that the only reason DeFi is more used

22:05.920 --> 22:08.260
 is because more people don't know about it.

22:08.260 --> 22:12.040
 And by virtue of this long kind of explanation

22:12.040 --> 22:14.920
 here and elsewhere, more people will know about it.

22:14.920 --> 22:17.720
 And it's just such an obviously superior solution

22:17.720 --> 22:20.960
 that I haven't heard a single explanation as to why.

22:20.960 --> 22:24.160
 No, no, don't earn 8% and take less risk

22:24.160 --> 22:26.660
 and have more transparency with your assets.

22:27.560 --> 22:29.800
 Earn 7% less, take more risk,

22:29.800 --> 22:32.640
 and give people the ability to change the rules on you

22:32.640 --> 22:35.220
 at their discretion, go do that.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.240
 Who's gonna do that?

22:37.240 --> 22:40.440
 And in general, on the first two of transparency and control,

22:40.440 --> 22:43.080
 first of all, I do think, maybe you can correct me,

22:43.080 --> 22:47.800
 but from my perspective, they're deeply tied together

22:47.800 --> 22:50.800
 in the sense that transparency gives control.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.880
 Transparency creates accountability,

22:52.880 --> 22:55.440
 and there's this kind of game being played,

22:55.440 --> 22:58.320
 game theoretic game, where if I know,

22:58.320 --> 23:00.640
 if you know I'm gonna discover your deviation,

23:00.640 --> 23:02.280
 you're not gonna deviate.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.800
 Yes, this could be a whole nother conversation,

23:04.800 --> 23:06.600
 but just as a small aside,

23:06.600 --> 23:08.600
 on the social network side of things,

23:08.600 --> 23:13.480
 which I've been thinking deeply about in the past year or so,

23:13.480 --> 23:18.360
 of how to do it right there, how to fix our social media.

23:18.360 --> 23:22.820
 And I tend to believe that human beings,

23:22.820 --> 23:25.240
 if they're given clear transparency

23:25.240 --> 23:28.160
 about which data is being stored, how it's being used,

23:28.160 --> 23:29.780
 where it's being moved about,

23:29.780 --> 23:32.840
 just all a clear, simple transparency

23:32.840 --> 23:36.420
 of how their data is being used,

23:36.420 --> 23:40.720
 and them having the control at the very minimal level

23:40.720 --> 23:43.840
 of being able to participate or to walk away,

23:43.840 --> 23:45.920
 and walk away means delete everything

23:45.920 --> 23:47.400
 you've ever known about me.

23:48.640 --> 23:51.960
 That will create a much, much better world.

23:51.960 --> 23:54.480
 That currently there's a complete lack of transparency

23:54.480 --> 23:56.740
 on social media, how the data is being used

23:56.740 --> 23:57.580
 for your own protection.

23:57.580 --> 23:58.520
 I mean, there's a lot of parallels

23:58.520 --> 24:00.480
 to the central bank situation,

24:00.480 --> 24:02.640
 and there's not a control element

24:02.640 --> 24:04.080
 of being able to walk away.

24:04.080 --> 24:06.360
 Like being able to delete all your data,

24:06.360 --> 24:09.420
 delete your account on Facebook is very difficult.

24:09.420 --> 24:11.600
 It doesn't take a single click,

24:11.600 --> 24:12.920
 which I think is what it should take.

24:12.920 --> 24:15.020
 There should be a big red button that says,

24:15.020 --> 24:17.400
 delete everything you've ever known about me,

24:17.400 --> 24:19.240
 or like forget me.

24:19.240 --> 24:21.700
 So I think that coupled together can create

24:21.700 --> 24:24.880
 a very different kind of world and create

24:24.880 --> 24:29.880
 an incentivization that will lead to like progress

24:29.920 --> 24:32.680
 and innovation and just like a much better social network

24:32.680 --> 24:37.680
 and a really good business for the future social networks.

24:37.800 --> 24:42.160
 But so I tend to see like control as naturally

24:43.440 --> 24:47.680
 being a sort of an outgrowth from the transparency.

24:47.680 --> 24:49.520
 It should all start at the transparency,

24:49.520 --> 24:54.000
 which is why the smart contract formulation is fascinating.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
 Because like you're formalizing in a simple, clear way,

24:59.160 --> 25:01.480
 any agreements that you're participating in.

25:01.480 --> 25:05.640
 And as a side comment also, what's really inspiring to me

25:05.640 --> 25:07.760
 is that I think there's a greater,

25:07.760 --> 25:09.720
 I don't know if this is always the case,

25:09.720 --> 25:12.480
 but it seems like from having talked to people

25:12.480 --> 25:14.600
 on the psychological element,

25:14.600 --> 25:19.600
 there's a hunger amongst people for transparency

25:21.160 --> 25:23.240
 and for control.

25:23.240 --> 25:26.200
 Like transparency, another word for that is authenticity.

25:26.200 --> 25:29.520
 If you look at the kind of stuff that people hunger for now,

25:29.520 --> 25:32.920
 they want to know the reality of who you are

25:32.920 --> 25:33.760
 as an individual.

25:33.760 --> 25:35.840
 So that means you can create businesses,

25:35.840 --> 25:39.960
 you can create tools that are built on authenticity,

25:39.960 --> 25:41.320
 a transparency.

25:41.320 --> 25:45.880
 And then the same, I'm inspired by the intelligence

25:45.880 --> 25:48.080
 of people, if you give them control,

25:48.080 --> 25:52.760
 if you give them power, that they would make good choices.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.040
 That's really exciting.

25:54.040 --> 25:56.480
 Of course, not everybody, but that means that

25:56.480 --> 26:01.480
 decentralized power can create effective systems.

26:01.680 --> 26:03.840
 So couple that, there's a hunger for transparency

26:03.840 --> 26:06.400
 so we can move to a world where everyone's being

26:06.400 --> 26:10.920
 just like real, conveying their genuine human nature.

26:10.920 --> 26:14.160
 And people are sufficiently intelligent

26:14.160 --> 26:16.120
 that if they're given power

26:16.120 --> 26:18.800
 in a distributed mass scale sense,

26:18.800 --> 26:21.440
 that we're going to build a better world through that,

26:21.440 --> 26:24.160
 as opposed to centralized supervised control

26:24.160 --> 26:26.600
 or only a small percent of the population

26:26.600 --> 26:27.600
 know what the hell they're doing.

26:27.600 --> 26:29.720
 Everybody else is clueless sheep.

26:30.880 --> 26:35.440
 So those two coupled together is really to me inspiring.

26:35.440 --> 26:36.880
 Just to really quickly comment on this stuff

26:36.880 --> 26:38.480
 that you just said, which I think is super,

26:38.480 --> 26:40.440
 super, super fascinating.

26:40.440 --> 26:42.760
 I think that's all exactly right.

26:42.760 --> 26:44.720
 I think everything that you said is right.

26:44.720 --> 26:46.080
 And I think it's actually going to be the same

26:46.080 --> 26:47.960
 for social media and banking and every other type

26:47.960 --> 26:51.160
 of contract, is that all of those systems

26:51.160 --> 26:53.400
 that house people's value for them

26:53.400 --> 26:56.760
 and take control of either their social media value

26:56.760 --> 27:00.120
 or their financial value or whatever for them,

27:00.120 --> 27:02.480
 all of that is going to be made available to people

27:02.480 --> 27:05.200
 in like this autonomous piece of code

27:05.200 --> 27:06.480
 that does the same thing

27:06.480 --> 27:08.800
 that the centralized entity used to do.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.760
 So they get all the features,

27:10.760 --> 27:14.360
 but the autonomous piece of code gives them the ability

27:14.360 --> 27:17.720
 to have control while getting all the features, right?

27:17.720 --> 27:19.840
 So banks give you features,

27:19.840 --> 27:22.520
 social media sites give you features,

27:22.520 --> 27:24.480
 whatever other system that you use online

27:24.480 --> 27:27.120
 gives you features, and then it takes your data

27:27.120 --> 27:29.720
 and it takes control of your assets from you

27:29.720 --> 27:32.240
 in return for those features, right?

27:32.240 --> 27:34.520
 I think the whole big difference here,

27:34.520 --> 27:37.040
 partly in line with the definition of smart contracts

27:37.040 --> 27:39.200
 and its evolution is that there's this,

27:39.200 --> 27:41.960
 now there's this autonomous piece of code

27:41.960 --> 27:44.440
 that's giving you all those features

27:44.440 --> 27:49.440
 without requiring the ownership and lock in and control

27:49.440 --> 27:54.080
 and unilateral kind of ownership of your data

27:54.080 --> 27:58.800
 or your value or whatever it is that you're giving it, right?

27:58.800 --> 28:02.040
 And I think what this will lead to fundamentally

28:02.040 --> 28:04.760
 is just more of a free market dynamic

28:04.760 --> 28:07.120
 among how people make,

28:07.120 --> 28:08.840
 I think with the social media folks,

28:08.840 --> 28:11.720
 you should just make some kind of law or something

28:11.720 --> 28:14.240
 where you can just export all your data from them,

28:14.240 --> 28:16.960
 everyone should be able to get their data exported

28:16.960 --> 28:18.680
 by another application,

28:18.680 --> 28:21.520
 and then the network effect of all these social media sites

28:21.520 --> 28:22.360
 will kind of crumble

28:22.360 --> 28:24.840
 because people will just combine your Twitter data

28:24.840 --> 28:27.000
 with your Facebook data, with everything else

28:27.000 --> 28:29.040
 into an application that you control,

28:29.040 --> 28:31.800
 and there'll just be thousands of different interfaces

28:31.800 --> 28:34.680
 competing for how to consume all the social media data

28:34.680 --> 28:35.960
 because it isn't locked in

28:35.960 --> 28:38.400
 in one centralized actor's control.

28:38.400 --> 28:40.880
 And so this is just the recurring pattern

28:40.880 --> 28:42.600
 of what I think all of this will do

28:42.600 --> 28:46.000
 is it'll give people, it gives people a better deal, right?

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
 It gives them features without ownership of data,

28:49.000 --> 28:50.840
 without ownership of value,

28:50.840 --> 28:53.640
 and that's really the difference.

28:53.640 --> 28:54.920
 So I think this is a good place

28:54.920 --> 28:56.560
 to talk about smart contracts then.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.920
 Can you tell me the history of smart contracts

28:58.920 --> 29:02.680
 and the basic sort of definitions of what is it?

29:02.680 --> 29:05.880
 Sure, so I think smart contracts as a definition

29:05.880 --> 29:08.240
 has actually gone through some kind of changes

29:08.240 --> 29:10.000
 or small evolution.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.240
 Initially, I think it was actually a conception

29:12.240 --> 29:14.920
 of a digital agreement that was tamper proof

29:14.920 --> 29:17.120
 and could know things about the world, right?

29:17.120 --> 29:18.320
 So it could get proof

29:18.320 --> 29:20.280
 and it could define that something happened

29:20.280 --> 29:22.520
 and it could conclude an outcome

29:22.520 --> 29:24.160
 and release payment or do something else.

29:24.160 --> 29:26.360
 That's actually the definition of smart contracts

29:26.360 --> 29:28.440
 that I began working in this industry with

29:28.440 --> 29:29.560
 seven or eight years ago

29:29.560 --> 29:31.520
 when I started making smart contracts.

29:31.520 --> 29:34.920
 That is the conception that I had of a smart contract.

29:34.920 --> 29:38.920
 Then what happened was that was really hard to do, right?

29:38.920 --> 29:41.240
 Building that type of tamper proof digital agreement

29:41.240 --> 29:43.680
 that could also know things about the real world

29:43.680 --> 29:47.240
 and release payments back to people about those events

29:47.240 --> 29:49.560
 that were codified in this tamper proof format

29:49.560 --> 29:51.440
 was actually a very tall order.

29:51.440 --> 29:53.080
 Turns out it's consistent of three parts.

29:53.080 --> 29:54.600
 It's consisting of the contract,

29:54.600 --> 29:55.760
 the proof about what happened

29:55.760 --> 29:57.560
 and the release of value.

29:58.440 --> 30:00.480
 The way things have evolved so far

30:00.480 --> 30:05.480
 is that the definition has now come to mean on chain code.

30:05.560 --> 30:08.440
 So it's come to mean the codification

30:08.440 --> 30:11.680
 of contractual agreement on a blockchain, right?

30:11.680 --> 30:14.120
 So there's some code somewhere on some blockchain

30:14.120 --> 30:16.280
 that defines what the agreement is.

30:17.600 --> 30:20.840
 Now that eliminates the part of the definition

30:20.840 --> 30:23.160
 that's related to knowing things about the world

30:23.160 --> 30:26.080
 and it partly eliminates the definition about payments

30:26.080 --> 30:26.920
 and stuff like that.

30:26.920 --> 30:30.560
 But basically it's on chain code, right?

30:30.560 --> 30:34.000
 We in our recent work on a second white paper

30:34.000 --> 30:36.160
 have actually put out a different definition

30:36.160 --> 30:38.480
 that we call hybrid smart contracts

30:38.480 --> 30:41.440
 that actually tries to go back to the initial definition

30:41.440 --> 30:43.120
 that I started with seven or eight years ago,

30:43.120 --> 30:47.160
 which basically says that there's some proof somewhere

30:47.160 --> 30:48.440
 that's proven to the contract

30:48.440 --> 30:49.880
 and the contract can know that

30:49.880 --> 30:51.840
 and the contract can gain proof.

30:51.840 --> 30:55.040
 Then it can use that proof to settle the agreement

30:55.040 --> 30:57.520
 that's codified on a blockchain.

30:57.520 --> 31:00.440
 So you both need a mechanism to provide proof.

31:00.440 --> 31:02.720
 You need a mechanism to codify the contract

31:02.720 --> 31:05.480
 in a tamper proof way on something like a blockchain.

31:05.480 --> 31:06.880
 And then as with all contracts,

31:06.880 --> 31:07.800
 there's a presumption that there's

31:07.800 --> 31:09.480
 some kind of release of value.

31:09.480 --> 31:13.280
 So I think a smart contract in our industry right now

31:13.280 --> 31:15.040
 means on chain code,

31:15.040 --> 31:19.040
 which limits it to whatever can be done on chain only.

31:19.040 --> 31:22.240
 And then in our internal definition for us

31:22.240 --> 31:24.480
 and for us at Chainlink and for me,

31:24.480 --> 31:26.600
 it's hybrid smart contracts,

31:26.600 --> 31:28.480
 which is actually the original definition.

31:28.480 --> 31:32.520
 It's the idea that a contract can both know what happened

31:32.520 --> 31:36.720
 and automatically resolve to the proper outcome

31:36.720 --> 31:38.000
 based on what happened.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.080
 So you're referring to the Chainlink 2.0 white paper,

31:41.080 --> 31:45.640
 which is a paper that I recommend people look.

31:45.640 --> 31:48.200
 It's a very easy read and very well structured

31:48.200 --> 31:49.040
 and very thorough.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.400
 So I really enjoyed it.

31:50.400 --> 31:53.000
 Very recently released, I guess.

31:53.000 --> 31:53.920
 Can you dig in deeper?

31:53.920 --> 31:57.120
 What is a hybrid smart contract?

31:57.120 --> 31:59.760
 You mentioned sort of this idea of data

32:00.640 --> 32:05.640
 or knowing about the world and on chain and off chain.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.680
 So what are the different roles in this?

32:07.680 --> 32:10.600
 So hybrid, by the way, refers to the fact

32:10.600 --> 32:13.960
 that it's on chain and off chain contracts.

32:14.800 --> 32:18.560
 So maybe digging deeper of what the heck is it

32:18.560 --> 32:21.640
 and what does it mean to know stuff about the world?

32:21.640 --> 32:23.720
 Like how do you actually achieve that?

32:23.720 --> 32:25.080
 Yeah, absolutely.

32:26.080 --> 32:30.520
 So the on chain part is where the agreement itself is.

32:30.520 --> 32:32.960
 That's the smart contract itself.

32:32.960 --> 32:35.040
 And that's where you codify certain conditions,

32:35.040 --> 32:38.920
 such as the conditions under which an interest payment

32:38.920 --> 32:41.760
 is made or the conditions under which the contract pays out

32:41.760 --> 32:44.480
 the full amount that it holds to someone based

32:44.480 --> 32:47.080
 on a derivative outcome or something like that.

32:47.080 --> 32:49.120
 Now, what the on chain code is very good at

32:49.120 --> 32:52.160
 is creating transparency about what the core conditions

32:52.160 --> 32:53.920
 of the contract are.

32:53.920 --> 32:57.120
 It's very good at taking in money from other private keys

32:57.120 --> 33:00.800
 that send it tokens and send it value to hold.

33:00.800 --> 33:03.680
 And then it's also very good at returning money

33:03.680 --> 33:06.480
 or returning value back to other addresses

33:06.480 --> 33:08.000
 or other private keys.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.560
 It can also be involved in governance.

33:09.560 --> 33:11.680
 It can be involved in a few other private key signature

33:11.680 --> 33:14.400
 based operations.

33:14.400 --> 33:18.160
 But primarily the on chain part of a hybrid smart contract,

33:18.160 --> 33:21.360
 from what I've seen so far, defines the agreement,

33:21.360 --> 33:24.840
 takes in value and returns value based upon the conditions

33:24.840 --> 33:27.480
 codified in the agreement on a blockchain.

33:27.480 --> 33:30.400
 The second and equally important off chain part

33:30.400 --> 33:33.400
 is where the term oracle and an oracle comes in

33:33.400 --> 33:36.640
 or an oracle mechanism or a decentralized oracle network

33:36.640 --> 33:38.440
 as we describe it in the paper.

33:38.440 --> 33:43.440
 And this is another decentralized computational system

33:43.760 --> 33:45.280
 that has a different goal, right?

33:45.280 --> 33:48.840
 So blockchains have the goal of packaging transactions

33:48.840 --> 33:50.800
 into blocks and connecting them

33:50.800 --> 33:54.480
 in a cryptographically unique way to create security

33:54.480 --> 33:57.960
 and assurance about that chain of transactions.

33:57.960 --> 34:01.680
 Oracles and decentralized oracle networks

34:01.680 --> 34:06.320
 achieve consensus and they achieve decentralization

34:06.320 --> 34:09.000
 about the topic of what happened, right?

34:09.000 --> 34:11.520
 So blockchains structure transactions.

34:11.520 --> 34:14.280
 Some of those transactions might be the state changes

34:14.280 --> 34:16.960
 in different pieces of on chain code.

34:16.960 --> 34:21.960
 And then those on chain pieces of code require input.

34:23.320 --> 34:25.800
 I think the thing that people get kind of a little bit

34:25.800 --> 34:29.840
 thrown by is despite being called smart contracts,

34:29.840 --> 34:32.160
 the on chain code on a blockchain

34:32.160 --> 34:35.560
 cannot actually speak to any other system.

34:35.560 --> 34:38.400
 So blockchains are valuable and useful

34:38.400 --> 34:40.720
 as far as they're tamper proof and secure.

34:40.720 --> 34:42.200
 And to be tamper proof and secure,

34:42.200 --> 34:44.160
 they're made this kind of walled garden

34:44.160 --> 34:46.920
 that is able to know and interact

34:46.920 --> 34:49.600
 only with the highly reliable information

34:49.600 --> 34:51.800
 that's within that system,

34:51.800 --> 34:56.240
 which is basically tokens and private key signatures.

34:56.240 --> 34:59.320
 All the other world's information is not available

34:59.320 --> 35:01.280
 in a blockchain inherently.

35:01.280 --> 35:04.000
 And a smart contract or a piece of on chain code

35:04.000 --> 35:06.520
 can't just say, hey, I'm gonna go get some data

35:06.520 --> 35:09.800
 from over here because the API they would get it from

35:09.800 --> 35:11.840
 creates a whole bunch of security concerns

35:11.840 --> 35:13.440
 for the blockchain itself

35:13.440 --> 35:14.960
 and a whole bunch of consensus issues

35:14.960 --> 35:17.720
 about how to agree on what that API said

35:17.720 --> 35:19.320
 or what the truth of the world is, right?

35:19.320 --> 35:22.400
 Because it's not even agreeing on what one API said,

35:22.400 --> 35:25.360
 it's more so creating a reliable

35:25.360 --> 35:27.440
 form of decentralized computation

35:27.440 --> 35:30.040
 that can give you a definitive proof of what happened

35:30.040 --> 35:31.840
 and not just what one API said.

35:31.840 --> 35:34.520
 So for example, some of our most widely used networks

35:34.520 --> 35:37.480
 have well over 30 nodes and well over 10 data sources

35:37.480 --> 35:38.960
 that are all providing information

35:38.960 --> 35:40.640
 about the same type of data.

35:40.640 --> 35:43.960
 And then there's consensus on that one piece of data,

35:43.960 --> 35:46.400
 which is then written in and essentially given back

35:46.400 --> 35:49.880
 into the on chain code to tell it what happened

35:49.880 --> 35:52.240
 because you can't really make an agreement

35:52.240 --> 35:54.320
 unless you know what happened, right?

35:54.320 --> 35:55.680
 If you and me were to make an agreement

35:55.680 --> 35:57.400
 and set some contractual conditions,

35:57.400 --> 35:59.920
 but our agreement could never know what happened,

35:59.920 --> 36:02.640
 it would be completely useless.

36:02.640 --> 36:04.400
 However, if you and me made an agreement

36:04.400 --> 36:06.600
 and there was another system called an Oracle mechanism

36:06.600 --> 36:08.000
 or decentralized Oracle network

36:08.000 --> 36:10.600
 that proved what happened definitively

36:10.600 --> 36:12.000
 and you and me pre agreed

36:12.000 --> 36:15.120
 that whatever this mechanism says is what happened,

36:15.120 --> 36:18.800
 then we can achieve an entirely new level of automation.

36:18.800 --> 36:22.200
 We can suddenly say, there's this piece of on chain code

36:22.200 --> 36:23.520
 that's highly reliable.

36:23.520 --> 36:25.600
 We can give it millions, billions,

36:25.600 --> 36:27.880
 eventually trillions of dollars in value.

36:27.880 --> 36:30.840
 And it is controlled by this other system over here

36:30.840 --> 36:32.600
 that's also highly reliable

36:32.600 --> 36:35.040
 under this configurable set of definitive truth

36:35.040 --> 36:36.520
 and decentralization conditions,

36:36.520 --> 36:39.480
 which we all agree are sufficiently stringent

36:39.480 --> 36:41.360
 to control that much value.

36:41.360 --> 36:42.880
 And therefore the combination

36:42.880 --> 36:46.240
 of this tamper proof on chain representation of a contract

36:46.240 --> 36:50.200
 and this mutually agreed upon definition

36:50.200 --> 36:54.640
 of a trigger or a proof system combined

36:54.640 --> 36:56.760
 is a hybrid smart contract,

36:56.760 --> 36:59.320
 which as you can see probably already

36:59.320 --> 37:03.880
 does a lot more than just a contract on chain, right?

37:03.880 --> 37:05.640
 Can you talk about this consensus mechanism,

37:05.640 --> 37:07.560
 which by the way is just fascinating.

37:07.560 --> 37:11.480
 So there's the on chain consensus mechanism

37:11.480 --> 37:14.600
 of proof of work and proof of stake.

37:14.600 --> 37:19.600
 And then there is this Oracle network consensus mechanism

37:20.680 --> 37:22.560
 of what is true.

37:23.960 --> 37:26.960
 So how do you, can you compare the two?

37:26.960 --> 37:28.840
 Like how do you achieve that kind of consensus?

37:28.840 --> 37:30.880
 How do you achieve security

37:30.880 --> 37:35.520
 in integrating data about the world

37:35.520 --> 37:39.240
 in a way that's definitively true

37:39.240 --> 37:41.200
 in a way that is usefully true,

37:41.200 --> 37:44.480
 such that we can rely on it in making major agreements

37:44.480 --> 37:48.280
 that as you said, involve billions of trillions of dollars.

37:49.160 --> 37:50.440
 Right, so this is the challenging,

37:50.440 --> 37:51.880
 this is the challenging question, right?

37:51.880 --> 37:56.520
 This is the challenging problem that Oracle networks,

37:56.520 --> 37:59.640
 Oracles, we at Chainlink that we work on

37:59.640 --> 38:01.800
 in order to create this definitive truth

38:01.800 --> 38:04.360
 to trigger and create hyper automation

38:04.360 --> 38:06.640
 in this more advanced form,

38:06.640 --> 38:09.240
 more advanced form of hybrid smart contracts.

38:09.240 --> 38:12.400
 The reality I think of this problem

38:12.400 --> 38:16.520
 is that it is very specific to each use case.

38:16.520 --> 38:20.760
 And it, and this is actually how we've architected our system

38:20.760 --> 38:22.760
 is in a very flexible way.

38:22.760 --> 38:27.240
 So for example, you need an ability for an Oracle network

38:27.240 --> 38:30.320
 to grow in the amount of nodes that it has

38:30.320 --> 38:33.200
 relative to the value it secures, right?

38:33.200 --> 38:34.960
 So if you have an Oracle network

38:34.960 --> 38:37.240
 that secures a hundred thousand dollars

38:37.240 --> 38:40.080
 in like a beta of a financial product,

38:40.080 --> 38:42.640
 maybe it can be fine with only seven nodes

38:42.640 --> 38:44.440
 and only two or three data sources, right?

38:44.440 --> 38:47.120
 Because the risk to that Oracle network

38:47.120 --> 38:49.520
 is relatively low based on the value it secures.

38:50.960 --> 38:53.160
 So the first question is actually

38:53.160 --> 38:57.960
 how do you scale security relative to value

38:57.960 --> 38:59.480
 secured by that Oracle network?

38:59.480 --> 39:00.800
 Because it wouldn't be very efficient

39:00.800 --> 39:05.800
 to have a thousand nodes securing $100,000 worth of value.

39:05.800 --> 39:08.720
 So one of the first questions is how do we properly scale

39:08.720 --> 39:12.040
 and how do we compose ensembles of nodes

39:12.040 --> 39:14.840
 in a decentralized way where we can know that,

39:14.840 --> 39:17.320
 okay, we're going from seven nodes in a network

39:17.320 --> 39:22.320
 to 15, to 31, to 57, to 105, to a thousand, right?

39:23.520 --> 39:25.800
 So that's one dimension of the problem.

39:25.800 --> 39:27.440
 So you have to be scaling the number of nodes

39:27.440 --> 39:31.120
 relative to the value that's derived

39:31.120 --> 39:34.280
 from the truth integrated into those nodes.

39:34.280 --> 39:36.240
 Well, that's not the only problem, right?

39:36.240 --> 39:38.760
 The other side of this is that you're trying to create

39:38.760 --> 39:42.040
 a deterministic result, a deterministic output

39:42.040 --> 39:44.400
 from a set of non deterministic disparate systems,

39:44.400 --> 39:47.040
 data sources, or places that prove things.

39:47.040 --> 39:51.080
 Can you also, just as an aside, what is an Oracle node?

39:51.080 --> 39:53.480
 What is the role of an Oracle node?

39:53.480 --> 39:58.200
 Sure, so an Oracle node essentially exists in both places,

39:58.200 --> 40:00.120
 it exists in both worlds.

40:00.120 --> 40:02.760
 It exists as an on chain contract

40:02.760 --> 40:07.440
 that represents either an Oracle network or an Oracle node.

40:07.440 --> 40:10.400
 So there's an on chain interface in the form of a contract

40:10.400 --> 40:15.080
 that says, I exist to give you this list of inputs.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.920
 You can request weather data from me,

40:16.920 --> 40:18.960
 you can request price data from me,

40:18.960 --> 40:20.520
 you can ask me to send a payment somewhere.

40:20.520 --> 40:24.480
 So it's like an API, so it's a pointer to a API

40:24.480 --> 40:28.880
 that provides truth about this world.

40:28.880 --> 40:31.320
 It's an interface, so just like an API

40:31.320 --> 40:33.800
 is an interface for Web 2.0 engineers,

40:35.480 --> 40:39.480
 Oracle networks and the contracts that represent them

40:39.480 --> 40:42.480
 or individual nodes are the interface

40:42.480 --> 40:45.560
 of Web 3.0's use of services.

40:45.560 --> 40:48.600
 And services includes all services,

40:48.600 --> 40:52.560
 data, payment systems, messaging systems,

40:52.560 --> 40:56.200
 whatever Web 2.0 or any kind of computing service

40:56.200 --> 40:58.240
 that you can conceptualize,

40:58.240 --> 41:01.680
 needs an interface on chain in the form of a contract

41:01.680 --> 41:04.800
 that says, here are the services I can provide for you,

41:04.800 --> 41:07.280
 here are the transactions you need to send me

41:07.280 --> 41:11.240
 to get back this data or that computation or this result.

41:11.240 --> 41:12.360
 And then what you actually see

41:12.360 --> 41:14.000
 is that decentralized Oracle networks,

41:14.000 --> 41:16.960
 because they're uniquely capable of generating

41:16.960 --> 41:19.760
 their own computations in a decentralized way

41:19.760 --> 41:22.400
 around the data that they have access to,

41:22.400 --> 41:24.760
 you actually see decentralized Oracle networks

41:24.760 --> 41:26.360
 generating a lot of these services.

41:26.360 --> 41:29.440
 So for example, we have a randomness service,

41:29.440 --> 41:32.080
 a verifiable randomness function service

41:32.080 --> 41:35.040
 that basically provides randomness on chain

41:35.880 --> 41:38.160
 and that randomness is then used in lotteries

41:38.160 --> 41:40.240
 and various other contracts that need randomness.

41:40.240 --> 41:42.400
 But that randomness, it's not a piece of data

41:42.400 --> 41:43.680
 that comes from somewhere else.

41:43.680 --> 41:46.560
 We don't go to another data source and get it.

41:46.560 --> 41:49.000
 We generate it within an Oracle node

41:49.000 --> 41:52.120
 that then provides it over into Oracle node

41:52.120 --> 41:53.280
 or Oracle nodes that provide it

41:53.280 --> 41:55.160
 into the contracts themselves.

41:55.160 --> 41:57.760
 So why do you say Oracle nodes are non deterministic?

41:58.760 --> 42:01.080
 Well, they are as far as they come to consensus,

42:01.080 --> 42:05.720
 but there's this kind of different problem here, right?

42:05.720 --> 42:08.160
 The blockchains are very focused

42:08.160 --> 42:10.720
 on generating blocks of transactions

42:10.720 --> 42:13.600
 within a smaller universe of transaction types,

42:13.600 --> 42:16.880
 a certain block size and a certain set of conditions.

42:16.880 --> 42:20.640
 And then they have a economic system that says,

42:20.640 --> 42:23.280
 I will perpetually generate blocks of this size

42:23.280 --> 42:26.120
 with these transaction types in this kind of limited set

42:26.120 --> 42:29.240
 of transaction types, whether those are UTXO transactions

42:29.240 --> 42:31.840
 or scripted solidity or whatever it is.

42:32.920 --> 42:35.360
 Oracles and Oracle networks,

42:35.360 --> 42:36.840
 we don't have a blockchain, for example.

42:36.840 --> 42:38.680
 There is no chain link blockchain.

42:38.680 --> 42:41.920
 Our goal is not to generate a certain set

42:41.920 --> 42:45.240
 of very clearly predetermined transaction types

42:45.240 --> 42:48.120
 into a set of transactions that are put into blocks

42:48.120 --> 42:50.720
 and it will infinitely be done that way.

42:50.720 --> 42:54.840
 Our goal is actually to create what we call a Meta layer,

42:54.840 --> 42:58.840
 a decentralized Meta layer between the non deterministic,

42:58.840 --> 43:01.720
 highly unreliable world

43:01.720 --> 43:05.760
 and the highly hyper reliable world of blockchains

43:05.760 --> 43:08.480
 so that the unreliable world can be passed

43:08.480 --> 43:10.120
 through this decentralized Meta layer.

43:10.120 --> 43:13.920
 And it can coexist with a reliable on chain world.

43:13.920 --> 43:15.960
 Exactly, it can coexist and in some cases,

43:15.960 --> 43:17.800
 the Meta layer might generate it.

43:17.800 --> 43:20.240
 So the problem in giving you this straight answer

43:20.240 --> 43:24.160
 is that there's just such a wide array of services.

43:24.160 --> 43:25.000
 If you were to say,

43:25.000 --> 43:27.840
 well, Sergey, how do we generate randomness

43:27.840 --> 43:28.840
 from a data source?

43:28.840 --> 43:31.280
 Well, we don't use a data source to generate the randomness.

43:31.280 --> 43:33.160
 That's the type of service that can be generated

43:33.160 --> 43:35.200
 in an Oracle network itself.

43:35.200 --> 43:37.120
 And so there'll be certain computations

43:37.120 --> 43:40.240
 that Oracle networks themselves generate themselves

43:40.240 --> 43:43.000
 to augment and improve blockchains.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.600
 And it is actually the goal of Oracles

43:44.600 --> 43:45.720
 to consistently do that.

43:45.720 --> 43:48.280
 So if you were to think about the stack

43:48.280 --> 43:50.200
 in a very generic high level,

43:50.200 --> 43:52.400
 you would see blockchains or databases.

43:52.400 --> 43:53.720
 They're basically the data structures

43:53.720 --> 43:55.800
 that retain a lot of information

43:55.800 --> 43:58.400
 in this transparent, highly reliable form.

43:58.400 --> 44:01.880
 Smart contract code is the application logic.

44:01.880 --> 44:04.240
 It is the logic under which all of this

44:04.240 --> 44:06.320
 kind of activity occurs,

44:06.320 --> 44:09.480
 storing data in the data structure in the blockchain

44:09.480 --> 44:13.720
 as a database in a certain conceptualization of it.

44:13.720 --> 44:15.760
 And then Oracles and Oracle networks

44:15.760 --> 44:20.760
 are all the services that are used by the application code.

44:20.840 --> 44:23.360
 So, you know, by analogy, let's take Uber.

44:23.360 --> 44:27.800
 Uber initially, some core code goes and gets the GPS API

44:27.800 --> 44:30.000
 from Google Maps about the user's location,

44:30.000 --> 44:32.280
 sends a message to the user through Twilio,

44:32.280 --> 44:33.840
 pays the driver through Stripe.

44:34.720 --> 44:36.760
 If those services weren't available

44:36.760 --> 44:38.280
 to the people who made Uber,

44:38.280 --> 44:39.680
 they wouldn't have made Uber, right?

44:39.680 --> 44:41.120
 Because they would have written their core code

44:41.120 --> 44:42.280
 on some database,

44:42.280 --> 44:44.720
 and then they would have had to make a geolocation company,

44:44.720 --> 44:46.680
 a telecom messaging company,

44:46.680 --> 44:48.320
 and the global payments company.

44:48.320 --> 44:50.600
 And they wouldn't have done that because it's too hard.

44:50.600 --> 44:52.360
 And that's the weird scenario

44:52.360 --> 44:54.400
 that a lot of people in our industry are in.

44:54.400 --> 44:57.920
 And that's the problem that Oracles and Oracle networks fix

44:57.920 --> 45:00.920
 is they provide these decentralized services

45:00.920 --> 45:03.840
 to take this developer ecosystem,

45:03.840 --> 45:06.800
 the blockchain and smart contract developer ecosystem

45:06.800 --> 45:09.480
 from, hey, I can have a database

45:09.480 --> 45:11.040
 and write some application logic

45:11.040 --> 45:14.160
 about tokenization and voting and private key signing,

45:14.160 --> 45:17.400
 all of which is super useful and is a critical foundation.

45:17.400 --> 45:20.880
 But now, if you just layer on all the world's services,

45:20.880 --> 45:23.680
 whether that's market data, weather data, randomness,

45:23.680 --> 45:26.880
 suddenly people can build DeFi, fraud proof gaming,

45:26.880 --> 45:30.320
 fraud proof global trade, fraud proof ad networks.

45:30.320 --> 45:33.760
 And that's why this world of decentralized services

45:33.760 --> 45:35.440
 and decentralized Oracle networks

45:35.440 --> 45:38.880
 is particularly, in my opinion, important to our industry.

45:38.880 --> 45:39.720
 Yeah, it's funny.

45:39.720 --> 45:42.840
 And you talk about the currents of a decentralized world,

45:42.840 --> 45:44.200
 decentralized world, DeFi,

45:44.200 --> 45:48.160
 but decentralized services world is primarily just tokens.

45:48.160 --> 45:51.880
 And it's basically just financial transactions.

45:51.880 --> 45:55.480
 And the kind of thing, the reason why it's super exciting,

45:55.480 --> 45:58.160
 the kind of thing you do with Chainlink and Oracle networks

45:58.160 --> 46:00.120
 is that you can basically open up

46:00.120 --> 46:01.560
 the whole world of services

46:02.920 --> 46:07.920
 to this kind of decentralized smart contract world.

46:07.920 --> 46:12.920
 I mean, you're talking about just orders of magnitude

46:14.360 --> 46:16.080
 greater impact financially

46:16.080 --> 46:20.440
 and just socially and philosophically.

46:21.600 --> 46:23.360
 Are there interesting near term

46:23.360 --> 46:26.000
 and long term applications that excite you?

46:26.000 --> 46:27.720
 Yeah, there's a lot that excites me.

46:27.720 --> 46:28.920
 And that is how I think about it,

46:28.920 --> 46:29.880
 that it's not just about

46:29.880 --> 46:31.880
 we made a decentralized Oracle network.

46:31.880 --> 46:34.120
 It's about we made a decentralized service

46:34.120 --> 46:35.400
 or collection of services

46:35.400 --> 46:37.600
 that's going from hundreds to thousands.

46:37.600 --> 46:39.000
 And then people are able to build

46:39.000 --> 46:40.440
 the hybrid smart contracts,

46:40.440 --> 46:43.200
 which I think will redefine what our industry is about.

46:43.200 --> 46:44.480
 Because for example, for the people

46:44.480 --> 46:45.960
 that only learned about blockchains

46:45.960 --> 46:48.080
 through the lens of NFTs,

46:48.080 --> 46:50.360
 they understand blockchains through NFTs,

46:50.360 --> 46:53.120
 not through speculative tokens or Bitcoins, right?

46:53.120 --> 46:55.800
 And I think that will continue.

46:55.800 --> 46:58.280
 I think the use cases that excite me,

46:58.280 --> 47:01.000
 they vary between the developed market,

47:01.000 --> 47:04.440
 the developed world's economies and emerging markets.

47:04.440 --> 47:06.200
 I think in the developed world,

47:06.200 --> 47:09.160
 what you will see is that transparency,

47:09.160 --> 47:12.840
 creating a new level of information

47:12.840 --> 47:16.480
 for how markets work and the risk that is in markets

47:16.480 --> 47:19.640
 and kind of the dynamics that put

47:19.640 --> 47:20.960
 the global financial system

47:20.960 --> 47:23.600
 at systemic financial risk like 2008.

47:23.600 --> 47:25.880
 And my hope is that all of this infrastructure

47:25.880 --> 47:29.960
 will soften the boom and bust cycles

47:29.960 --> 47:32.280
 by making information immediately available

47:32.280 --> 47:34.000
 to all market participants,

47:34.000 --> 47:36.680
 which is by the way, what all market participants want,

47:36.680 --> 47:39.280
 except for the very, very, very small minority

47:39.280 --> 47:41.760
 that are able to game the system and their benefit

47:41.760 --> 47:43.640
 and benefit from booms but avoid busts

47:43.640 --> 47:46.160
 because of their asymmetric access to information,

47:46.160 --> 47:47.680
 which really everybody should have

47:47.680 --> 47:49.800
 and which this technically solves.

47:49.800 --> 47:51.720
 I think in the process of doing that

47:51.720 --> 47:54.320
 and which is happening, I think right about now,

47:54.320 --> 47:56.640
 you see a polishing of the technology

47:56.640 --> 47:59.680
 such that it can be made available to emerging markets.

47:59.680 --> 48:00.960
 And on a personal level,

48:00.960 --> 48:04.800
 I feel that the emerging markets will benefit much more

48:04.800 --> 48:06.120
 from this technology,

48:06.120 --> 48:08.360
 just like the emerging markets benefit much more

48:08.360 --> 48:12.440
 from the internet or from those $50 Android phones

48:12.440 --> 48:13.760
 that people can have,

48:13.760 --> 48:15.960
 because it's such a massive shift

48:15.960 --> 48:17.920
 in how people's lives work, right?

48:17.920 --> 48:20.320
 I have always had access to books and a library,

48:20.320 --> 48:23.200
 which has been fantastic and very important.

48:23.200 --> 48:24.520
 But there are places in the world

48:24.520 --> 48:26.480
 where people don't have libraries,

48:26.480 --> 48:29.920
 but now they have the internet and a $50 Android phone

48:29.920 --> 48:32.960
 and they can watch the same Stanford lecture that I watch.

48:32.960 --> 48:35.760
 I mean, that's kind of mind blowing realistically, right?

48:35.760 --> 48:38.560
 They just went from zero to one in a very,

48:38.560 --> 48:40.280
 very dramatic way.

48:40.280 --> 48:43.400
 I think all of these smart contracts,

48:43.400 --> 48:45.040
 and in my case, I think the one

48:45.040 --> 48:48.360
 that I seem to keep coming back to is crop insurance,

48:48.360 --> 48:49.840
 where partly because it doesn't have

48:49.840 --> 48:50.960
 a tokenization component,

48:50.960 --> 48:52.520
 partly because it's actually much more important

48:52.520 --> 48:54.280
 than it might seem.

48:55.920 --> 48:57.760
 What is crop insurance?

48:57.760 --> 49:02.760
 Right, so this is the nature of why it's sometimes hard

49:03.320 --> 49:05.200
 to see the full value of what our industry does,

49:05.200 --> 49:07.360
 because it solves all these kinds of backend problems

49:07.360 --> 49:08.400
 that we don't have, right?

49:08.400 --> 49:12.520
 So crop insurance is if I own a farm and it doesn't rain,

49:12.520 --> 49:14.160
 I get an insurance payout,

49:14.160 --> 49:16.280
 so I don't need to close down my farm,

49:16.280 --> 49:19.560
 because if it didn't rain, I don't have crops, right?

49:19.560 --> 49:23.680
 So people in the developed world can get crop insurance

49:23.680 --> 49:25.520
 and there's all kinds of systems

49:25.520 --> 49:26.680
 that basically pay them out,

49:26.680 --> 49:29.440
 and then they can argue with the insurance company

49:29.440 --> 49:31.840
 if they don't get paid out properly and whatever.

49:31.840 --> 49:35.960
 And this allows people to smooth out risk.

49:35.960 --> 49:39.040
 In fact, a lot of the global options markets

49:39.040 --> 49:40.200
 were about this, right?

49:40.200 --> 49:43.360
 They were initially about people selling their produce

49:43.360 --> 49:45.200
 or their crops ahead of time,

49:45.200 --> 49:47.280
 so that if there was a risk of drought,

49:47.280 --> 49:49.640
 they weren't impacted by it, right?

49:49.640 --> 49:51.360
 And that's where a lot of options trading

49:51.360 --> 49:53.680
 and all this kind of stuff came from,

49:53.680 --> 49:57.040
 even though it's now turned into this kind of global casino.

49:57.040 --> 49:58.960
 But in the emerging market,

49:58.960 --> 50:01.280
 there are literally people that,

50:01.280 --> 50:03.520
 if they don't have rain for two seasons,

50:03.520 --> 50:04.880
 they need to close down their farm

50:04.880 --> 50:07.240
 and become a migrant worker of some kind.

50:07.240 --> 50:10.160
 And now they have a $50 Android phone

50:10.160 --> 50:12.120
 where they can read Wikipedia,

50:12.120 --> 50:15.400
 but they're still decades away from an insurance company

50:15.400 --> 50:18.280
 coming to their geography and offering them insurance

50:18.280 --> 50:20.560
 because their local legal system simply doesn't allow

50:20.560 --> 50:22.040
 that type of thing to exist.

50:22.040 --> 50:25.040
 No insurance company is gonna go and create insurance entity

50:25.040 --> 50:27.680
 and offer them insurance because the levels of fraud

50:27.680 --> 50:29.640
 and the ability to resolve that fraud through courts

50:29.640 --> 50:31.280
 would just not exist.

50:31.280 --> 50:34.160
 So now these people have to wait for decades

50:34.160 --> 50:37.160
 to have this very basic form of financial protection

50:37.160 --> 50:39.520
 or something like a bank account even.

50:39.520 --> 50:42.000
 And with this technology, they don't, right?

50:42.000 --> 50:45.560
 So with this technology, if I have a $50 Android phone

50:45.560 --> 50:48.840
 and the smart contract has data from satellites

50:48.840 --> 50:51.200
 or weather stations about the weather conditions

50:51.200 --> 50:53.480
 in the geography that my farm is in,

50:53.480 --> 50:57.320
 I can put value into the smart contract

50:57.320 --> 51:00.720
 and the smart contract will automatically pay me out back,

51:00.720 --> 51:02.720
 pay me back out at my Android phone.

51:02.720 --> 51:04.120
 And guess what?

51:04.120 --> 51:07.680
 I just leapfrogged past my corrupt government

51:07.680 --> 51:10.800
 not being able to provide a legal infrastructure

51:10.800 --> 51:12.320
 to create insurance.

51:12.320 --> 51:15.080
 I just leapfrogged past dealing with insurance companies

51:15.080 --> 51:19.520
 that'll probably price gouge me and often not pay out.

51:19.520 --> 51:23.520
 And I leapfrogged into the world of hyper reliable

51:24.640 --> 51:27.560
 kind of guaranteed smart contract outcomes

51:27.560 --> 51:29.480
 that are as good or in many cases better

51:29.480 --> 51:31.440
 than what farmers in all parts of other parts

51:31.440 --> 51:32.720
 of the world have.

51:32.720 --> 51:35.160
 And this type of dynamic for the emerging markets

51:35.160 --> 51:37.960
 of creating a way for people to control and manage risk

51:37.960 --> 51:41.200
 in their economic life, I think extends way past insurance.

51:41.200 --> 51:42.800
 It extends to them having bank accounts

51:42.800 --> 51:44.360
 to combat local inflation.

51:44.360 --> 51:46.680
 It extends to them being able to sell their goods

51:46.680 --> 51:50.200
 on the free market of global trade without middlemen.

51:50.200 --> 51:51.320
 It extends to all these things

51:51.320 --> 51:53.120
 that we don't really care about, right?

51:53.120 --> 51:54.840
 Because we're not farmers,

51:54.840 --> 51:57.920
 but are unbelievably impactful for people

51:57.920 --> 51:59.480
 that don't have a bank account

51:59.480 --> 52:03.320
 and their inflation rate in their country is double digits

52:03.320 --> 52:06.040
 or their farm completely depends on rain

52:06.040 --> 52:07.800
 or their livelihood completely depends

52:07.800 --> 52:10.120
 on their ability to sell goods.

52:10.120 --> 52:12.720
 And they can't sell those goods because there's a middleman

52:12.720 --> 52:16.160
 who essentially controls all the trust relationships.

52:16.160 --> 52:18.640
 But now we have the internet and smart contracts

52:18.640 --> 52:20.800
 and that might not have to be the case

52:20.800 --> 52:22.480
 in the next five or 10 years.

52:22.480 --> 52:25.560
 Yeah, so that definitely has a quality of life impact

52:25.560 --> 52:27.040
 on the particular farmer's life,

52:27.040 --> 52:32.040
 but I suspect it has a huge like down the line ripple effect

52:32.600 --> 52:33.920
 on the whole supply chain.

52:33.920 --> 52:36.160
 So if you think about farmers,

52:36.160 --> 52:41.160
 but any other people that produce things

52:41.160 --> 52:46.160
 that are part of a large like logistics network,

52:46.800 --> 52:48.920
 like supply chain network,

52:48.920 --> 52:52.520
 that means when you increase reliability,

52:52.520 --> 52:57.520
 you sort of increase transparency and control,

52:57.520 --> 53:01.880
 but like where any one node in that supply chain network

53:01.880 --> 53:06.280
 can formalize the way it operates

53:06.280 --> 53:08.640
 in its agreements with others,

53:08.640 --> 53:13.640
 then you could just have a very like at scale

53:13.840 --> 53:18.840
 transformative effect on how people that down the line

53:18.960 --> 53:20.880
 use the services that you provide,

53:20.880 --> 53:23.240
 the products that you create operate.

53:23.240 --> 53:26.720
 So like, it's almost hard to imagine

53:27.680 --> 53:30.520
 the possible ways it might transform the world.

53:30.520 --> 53:33.160
 I wonder how much friction there is in the system,

53:33.160 --> 53:37.520
 I guess, currently that smart contracts might remove.

53:37.520 --> 53:40.680
 That's almost unknown.

53:40.680 --> 53:44.440
 You can sort of hypothesize and stuff, but I wonder.

53:44.440 --> 53:47.840
 I've seen enough bureaucracy in my life

53:47.840 --> 53:50.400
 to know that smart contracts in many cases

53:50.400 --> 53:52.560
 would remove bureaucracy.

53:52.560 --> 53:55.600
 And I wonder how the world will be

53:55.600 --> 53:58.320
 once you remove much of the bureaucracy.

53:58.320 --> 54:00.120
 Coming from the Soviet Union,

54:00.120 --> 54:05.120
 where I just have seen the life sucked out

54:05.120 --> 54:10.120
 of the innovative spirit of human nature by bureaucracy.

54:11.280 --> 54:14.880
 I wonder, the kind of amazing world that could be created

54:14.880 --> 54:16.440
 once bureaucracy is removed.

54:17.920 --> 54:22.280
 Yeah, I think it's fascinating how the world can evolve.

54:22.280 --> 54:25.280
 I think this extends a lot further than people think

54:25.280 --> 54:28.040
 into many, many different parts of the global economy.

54:28.040 --> 54:30.880
 It might start with NFTs for art,

54:30.880 --> 54:33.280
 or it might start with DeFi, right?

54:33.280 --> 54:36.600
 Or it might start with fraud proof ad networks next.

54:36.600 --> 54:39.320
 We don't know what it's gonna go to next,

54:39.320 --> 54:42.440
 but I think the implication of people being

54:42.440 --> 54:46.360
 in a system of contracts that holds them accountable

54:46.360 --> 54:48.960
 and guarantees contractual outcomes,

54:48.960 --> 54:51.240
 regardless of a local legal system,

54:51.240 --> 54:53.960
 is something that I think extends to the supply chain.

54:53.960 --> 54:57.720
 You can prove that goods were sourced in an ethical way,

54:57.720 --> 55:00.200
 and you can prove that in a way that can't be gamed.

55:00.200 --> 55:03.480
 That'll change buying power and supplier power

55:03.480 --> 55:06.760
 and how people produce goods that we all consume.

55:06.760 --> 55:08.840
 And then on the political level,

55:08.840 --> 55:11.760
 I personally think that in a number of decades,

55:11.760 --> 55:13.560
 we could literally be in a place

55:13.560 --> 55:16.000
 where politicians can commit

55:16.000 --> 55:20.360
 to a certain set of smart contract kind of budget,

55:20.360 --> 55:22.280
 definitional kind of results.

55:22.280 --> 55:24.560
 For example, we discovered oil.

55:24.560 --> 55:26.840
 I promise as a politician, I'm gonna take the oil

55:26.840 --> 55:29.200
 and I'm gonna redistribute it to all of you.

55:29.200 --> 55:30.440
 Well, that's wonderful.

55:30.440 --> 55:31.640
 That's a great idea.

55:31.640 --> 55:34.240
 Sounds very nice when you're running for office.

55:34.240 --> 55:36.760
 Why don't we codify that in a smart contract?

55:36.760 --> 55:38.760
 And why don't we put those conditions

55:38.760 --> 55:40.680
 very solidly on a blockchain?

55:40.680 --> 55:44.040
 And then once you've been elected,

55:44.040 --> 55:45.760
 we'll just turn that one on

55:45.760 --> 55:48.880
 and it'll distribute the money just like you said,

55:48.880 --> 55:50.520
 and everything will be fine.

55:50.520 --> 55:53.880
 I personally think that this new level of systems

55:53.880 --> 55:57.160
 that allows trustworthy collaboration between everybody,

55:57.160 --> 55:59.680
 between supply chain partners, ad network users,

55:59.680 --> 56:04.080
 the financial system, insurance companies, and farmers,

56:04.080 --> 56:06.480
 all of these are just interactions

56:06.480 --> 56:09.520
 that require a trusted entity,

56:09.520 --> 56:12.200
 or in this case, a trusted piece of code

56:12.200 --> 56:14.440
 to orchestrate the interaction

56:14.440 --> 56:17.440
 in the way that everyone agrees.

56:17.440 --> 56:20.200
 Yeah, one of the things that makes the United States

56:20.200 --> 56:23.080
 fascinating is the founding documents.

56:23.080 --> 56:26.000
 And it's fascinating to think of us moving into the new

56:26.000 --> 56:30.240
 in the 21st century to a digital version of that.

56:30.240 --> 56:33.280
 So the constitution, a smart constitution,

56:33.280 --> 56:35.960
 no offense to the paper constitution,

56:37.080 --> 56:39.800
 and that would have transformative effects

56:39.800 --> 56:42.160
 on politicians and governments,

56:43.200 --> 56:45.640
 holding people accountable.

56:45.640 --> 56:50.560
 Oh man, that's so exciting to think that

56:50.560 --> 56:55.560
 we might enforce accountability

56:58.200 --> 57:00.920
 through the smart contract process.

57:00.920 --> 57:02.640
 Exactly, why can't that happen?

57:02.640 --> 57:05.680
 Anything that we could codify into a smart contract,

57:05.680 --> 57:07.160
 and anything that we all agree

57:07.160 --> 57:09.120
 is the way the world should work.

57:09.120 --> 57:12.280
 And then anything that we can get proof about, right?

57:12.280 --> 57:15.800
 Anything that a system somewhere could tell us happened,

57:15.800 --> 57:19.040
 those are the pieces of the puzzle, right?

57:19.040 --> 57:21.120
 We need a trusted piece of code,

57:21.120 --> 57:23.040
 we need to have agreement

57:23.040 --> 57:24.560
 that that's how the world should work,

57:24.560 --> 57:26.760
 and we need a system that'll tell that trusted piece

57:26.760 --> 57:28.480
 of code what happened.

57:28.480 --> 57:30.760
 As long as we have those three things,

57:30.760 --> 57:34.040
 we can theoretically codify any set of agreements

57:34.040 --> 57:39.040
 about anything where those three properties take hold.

57:39.800 --> 57:40.920
 I wonder if you could apply that

57:40.920 --> 57:43.760
 to like military conflict and so on.

57:43.760 --> 57:48.080
 Recently, Biden announced that we're going to pull off

57:48.080 --> 57:52.480
 from Afghanistan after 20 years in the war.

57:52.480 --> 57:57.480
 I wonder, there's a lot of debacles around war in Afghanistan

57:58.600 --> 58:00.960
 and invasion of Iraq, all those kinds of things.

58:00.960 --> 58:04.720
 I wonder if that was instead formulated as a smart contract.

58:06.280 --> 58:11.000
 Like that might have actually huge impact

58:11.000 --> 58:12.640
 on the way we do conflict.

58:12.640 --> 58:15.360
 So you think of the smart contract

58:15.360 --> 58:18.720
 as a kind of win win situation where you're doing

58:18.720 --> 58:21.520
 like financial transactions or something like that.

58:21.520 --> 58:25.320
 But you could see that also about military conflict

58:25.320 --> 58:30.040
 or like whenever two nations are at tension with each other,

58:30.040 --> 58:32.000
 different scales of conflict,

58:32.000 --> 58:35.200
 that you can have conflict codified.

58:36.800 --> 58:40.920
 And that would potentially resolve conflict much faster

58:40.920 --> 58:43.360
 because there's honesty, transparency and control

58:43.360 --> 58:46.160
 within that conflict, because there's conflict in this world.

58:46.160 --> 58:49.800
 And I, again, very, very inspiring to think

58:49.800 --> 58:52.880
 about the kind of effects it might have

58:52.880 --> 58:56.360
 on the negative kinds of contracts,

58:56.360 --> 58:59.560
 on the tense, painful kinds of contracts.

58:59.560 --> 59:01.240
 I haven't thought about that as much.

59:01.240 --> 59:02.200
 It's actually kind of scary,

59:02.200 --> 59:04.000
 the stuff you're thinking through now

59:04.000 --> 59:06.240
 with like the war contracts or something.

59:06.240 --> 59:07.360
 That's not in the white paper.

59:07.360 --> 59:09.560
 We don't have anything about war contracts or anything.

59:09.560 --> 59:12.520
 Again, this is the Russian, we're both Russian,

59:12.520 --> 59:15.280
 but I'm a little more Russian in the suffering side.

59:15.280 --> 59:17.200
 Maybe I read way too much Dostoevsky

59:17.200 --> 59:19.400
 and military kind of ideas.

59:19.400 --> 59:24.400
 But anyway, holding politicians accountable in all forms,

59:24.960 --> 59:26.160
 I think is really powerful.

59:26.160 --> 59:29.200
 Is there something you could say as a small aside

59:29.200 --> 59:33.520
 on how smart contracts actually work if we look at the code?

59:33.520 --> 59:37.160
 Is there some nice way to say technically

59:37.160 --> 59:39.000
 what is a smart contract?

59:39.000 --> 59:41.640
 What does it mean to codify these agreements,

59:41.640 --> 59:42.920
 the actual process for people

59:42.920 --> 59:44.560
 who might not at all be familiar?

59:46.480 --> 59:48.640
 I think you just write it into code

59:48.640 --> 59:52.560
 that operates in this kind of decentralized infrastructure.

59:52.560 --> 59:54.160
 You usually write code

59:54.160 --> 59:56.160
 that runs in a central server somewhere.

59:56.160 --> 59:58.800
 Now you write code that runs across a lot

59:58.800 --> 1:00:01.440
 of different machines in this decentralized way.

1:00:01.440 --> 1:00:04.480
 And then after you write it, you need services.

1:00:04.480 --> 1:00:05.580
 And that's where oracles come in,

1:00:05.580 --> 1:00:07.200
 they provide all the services.

1:00:07.200 --> 1:00:10.360
 So just like you would be writing code in web 2.0 land,

1:00:10.360 --> 1:00:11.560
 running it on a server somewhere

1:00:11.560 --> 1:00:14.880
 and using an API, here you'd be writing code,

1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:16.640
 putting it on a decentralized infrastructure

1:00:16.640 --> 1:00:20.120
 like a blockchain or a smart contract platform like Ethereum.

1:00:20.120 --> 1:00:22.640
 And then you would be using various services

1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:23.640
 in the form of oracles.

1:00:23.640 --> 1:00:24.940
 So they'll just be called oracles

1:00:24.940 --> 1:00:27.400
 or decentralized services instead of APIs.

1:00:27.400 --> 1:00:31.120
 And you're basically composing the same type of architecture

1:00:31.120 --> 1:00:33.120
 except it's hyper reliable.

1:00:33.120 --> 1:00:34.760
 At the moment, it's a little bit less efficient

1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:39.160
 because there's an early stage to our industry.

1:00:39.160 --> 1:00:43.200
 But it provides this extreme level of reliability

1:00:43.200 --> 1:00:46.240
 and transparency, which for certain use cases

1:00:46.240 --> 1:00:48.720
 is an absolute critical component

1:00:48.720 --> 1:00:50.840
 and is completely reinventing how they work.

1:00:50.840 --> 1:00:53.920
 So I think people should look at what are the use cases

1:00:53.920 --> 1:00:56.520
 where that trust dynamic can be so heavily improved.

1:00:56.520 --> 1:00:57.720
 And that's probably the ones

1:00:57.720 --> 1:00:59.560
 where this is maybe initially useful.

1:00:59.560 --> 1:01:01.680
 But I mean, just to emphasize,

1:01:01.680 --> 1:01:04.360
 I don't think people realize when you say code

1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:09.240
 that we're talking about non obfuscated actual program.

1:01:09.240 --> 1:01:11.960
 Like you can read it, you can understand it.

1:01:11.960 --> 1:01:14.100
 And there's something about,

1:01:15.140 --> 1:01:17.320
 maybe this is my computer science perspective

1:01:17.320 --> 1:01:19.640
 of like software engineering perspective,

1:01:19.640 --> 1:01:21.320
 but there's something about the formalism

1:01:21.320 --> 1:01:26.320
 of programming languages, which enforces simplicity

1:01:26.400 --> 1:01:28.040
 and clarity and transparency.

1:01:28.040 --> 1:01:31.960
 And because it's seen to everybody,

1:01:31.960 --> 1:01:34.080
 I mean, simplicity is enforced.

1:01:34.080 --> 1:01:36.600
 There's something about natural language,

1:01:36.600 --> 1:01:40.780
 like language as written in the constitution, for example,

1:01:40.780 --> 1:01:43.220
 where there's so many interpretations.

1:01:44.360 --> 1:01:47.580
 With the nice thing about programs,

1:01:47.580 --> 1:01:51.120
 there's not going to be a huge number of books written

1:01:51.120 --> 1:01:54.160
 about what was meant by this particular line

1:01:54.160 --> 1:01:55.540
 because it's pretty clear.

1:01:56.400 --> 1:01:58.880
 Like programming languages have a clarity to them

1:01:58.880 --> 1:02:01.460
 that natural language does not,

1:02:01.460 --> 1:02:06.120
 and they don't have ambiguity, which I think it's important

1:02:06.120 --> 1:02:08.260
 to pause on because it's really powerful.

1:02:08.260 --> 1:02:09.920
 It's really difficult to think about.

1:02:09.920 --> 1:02:12.320
 I think we live in a world where all the philosophers

1:02:12.320 --> 1:02:15.360
 and legal minds don't know how to program.

1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:18.560
 So I think, not all, most don't.

1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:22.800
 And so we don't often see the philosophical impact

1:02:22.800 --> 1:02:25.200
 of this kind of idea that the agreements

1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:30.040
 between humans can be written in a programming language.

1:02:30.040 --> 1:02:32.760
 That's a really transformative idea.

1:02:32.760 --> 1:02:37.760
 That, I mean, yeah, it's an idea that's not just technical.

1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:39.560
 It's not just financial.

1:02:39.560 --> 1:02:41.000
 It's philosophical.

1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:44.400
 It's rethinking human nature from a digital perspective.

1:02:46.400 --> 1:02:48.100
 Like what is human civilization?

1:02:48.100 --> 1:02:49.780
 It's interaction between humans.

1:02:51.040 --> 1:02:55.840
 And rethinking that interaction as a digital interaction

1:02:55.840 --> 1:02:58.100
 that is managed by programming languages,

1:02:58.100 --> 1:03:00.840
 by programs, by code.

1:03:00.840 --> 1:03:03.320
 I mean, that's fascinating.

1:03:03.320 --> 1:03:05.760
 That we'll look back at this time potentially

1:03:06.840 --> 1:03:10.120
 as one where us little descendants of apes

1:03:10.120 --> 1:03:15.120
 did not realize how important this moment in history is.

1:03:16.040 --> 1:03:18.560
 Like human beings might be totally different

1:03:19.640 --> 1:03:23.640
 a century from now because we codified

1:03:23.640 --> 1:03:25.840
 the interaction between humans.

1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:28.760
 That might have more of an impact than anything else

1:03:28.760 --> 1:03:30.360
 we do today.

1:03:30.360 --> 1:03:31.760
 You think about the impact of the internet,

1:03:31.760 --> 1:03:35.020
 one of the cool things is digitization of data.

1:03:35.020 --> 1:03:38.100
 But we have not yet integrated the tools,

1:03:38.100 --> 1:03:42.320
 the mechanisms fully that use that data

1:03:42.320 --> 1:03:43.840
 and interact with humans yet.

1:03:43.840 --> 1:03:45.840
 And that's what smart contracts do.

1:03:45.840 --> 1:03:47.600
 I wonder if you think about the role

1:03:47.600 --> 1:03:50.200
 of artificial intelligence in all of this.

1:03:50.200 --> 1:03:56.200
 Because your smart contracts are kind of agreements,

1:03:56.380 --> 1:03:57.600
 maybe you disagree with this,

1:03:57.600 --> 1:03:59.880
 but at least the way I'm thinking about it

1:03:59.880 --> 1:04:03.920
 is agreements between humans or groups of humans.

1:04:03.920 --> 1:04:07.220
 But it seems like because everything's operating

1:04:07.220 --> 1:04:10.600
 in the digital space that you can integrate

1:04:10.600 --> 1:04:12.960
 non humans into this.

1:04:12.960 --> 1:04:16.180
 Or AI systems that help out humans,

1:04:16.180 --> 1:04:17.600
 managed by humans.

1:04:17.600 --> 1:04:20.960
 Like what do you think about a world

1:04:20.960 --> 1:04:23.120
 of hybrid smart contracts,

1:04:25.480 --> 1:04:30.480
 codifying agreements between hybrid

1:04:30.840 --> 1:04:34.760
 intelligent being networks of humans and AI systems?

1:04:35.620 --> 1:04:39.080
 Yeah, I think that makes perfect sense.

1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:42.300
 In terms of AI, I'm not an expert, right?

1:04:42.300 --> 1:04:45.320
 So it might be a bit simplistic or naive,

1:04:45.320 --> 1:04:48.400
 my ideas in this field.

1:04:48.400 --> 1:04:51.760
 I think everyone saw the Terminator movie, right?

1:04:51.760 --> 1:04:55.000
 Everybody kind of saw the Terminator movie in the 90s.

1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:57.520
 And it was like, this is really scary.

1:04:57.520 --> 1:05:02.160
 I personally think AI is amazing and makes perfect sense.

1:05:02.160 --> 1:05:06.400
 I think it will evolve to a place where people have...

1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:07.240
 Just to understand,

1:05:07.240 --> 1:05:09.460
 I work in the world of trust issues, right?

1:05:09.460 --> 1:05:12.980
 I work in the world of how can technology solve trust

1:05:12.980 --> 1:05:16.080
 and collaboration issues using encryption,

1:05:16.080 --> 1:05:18.280
 using cryptographically guaranteed systems,

1:05:18.280 --> 1:05:20.040
 using decentralized infrastructure, right?

1:05:20.040 --> 1:05:22.240
 So that's the world that I've been inhabiting

1:05:22.240 --> 1:05:24.800
 for many, many years now,

1:05:24.800 --> 1:05:26.480
 building smart contracts for seven or eight,

1:05:26.480 --> 1:05:27.520
 doing stuff before that.

1:05:27.520 --> 1:05:29.360
 It's kind of what I'm focused on.

1:05:29.360 --> 1:05:32.920
 So I view AI through that same lens.

1:05:32.920 --> 1:05:34.280
 And my brain naturally asks,

1:05:34.280 --> 1:05:35.900
 well, what is the trust issue

1:05:35.900 --> 1:05:37.920
 that people might have with AI?

1:05:37.920 --> 1:05:40.600
 And my natural kind of response is,

1:05:40.600 --> 1:05:44.840
 well, let's say AI continues to be built and improve.

1:05:44.840 --> 1:05:48.000
 At some point, I have no clue where we are on this now.

1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:51.040
 I've seen different ideas that were very far from this.

1:05:51.040 --> 1:05:52.840
 I've seen other ideas were very close to this.

1:05:52.840 --> 1:05:55.480
 At a certain point, we'd arrive at a place with AI

1:05:55.480 --> 1:05:57.840
 where we would be a little bit worried

1:05:57.840 --> 1:05:59.600
 about just how much it could do, right?

1:05:59.600 --> 1:06:02.180
 We might be worried that AI could do things

1:06:02.180 --> 1:06:04.240
 we don't want it to do,

1:06:04.240 --> 1:06:06.320
 but we still want to give AI

1:06:06.320 --> 1:06:08.600
 a level of control over our lives, right?

1:06:08.600 --> 1:06:11.680
 So in my world, that's a trust issue.

1:06:11.680 --> 1:06:13.160
 And the way that that trust issue

1:06:13.160 --> 1:06:15.000
 would be solved with blockchains

1:06:15.000 --> 1:06:16.840
 is actually very straightforward.

1:06:16.840 --> 1:06:19.780
 And I think in its simplicity, quite powerful.

1:06:19.780 --> 1:06:23.420
 You could have an AI that has an ability to do

1:06:23.420 --> 1:06:28.420
 and control key parts of your and our lives, right?

1:06:28.680 --> 1:06:32.040
 But then you could limit it with private keys

1:06:32.040 --> 1:06:35.800
 and blockchains and create certain guardrails

1:06:35.800 --> 1:06:40.800
 and firm kind of walls and limits

1:06:41.720 --> 1:06:44.260
 to what the AI could never go past,

1:06:44.260 --> 1:06:46.960
 assuming that encryption, right?

1:06:46.960 --> 1:06:49.000
 That encryption continues to work, right?

1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:53.060
 And assuming that if it's not that AI's specialization

1:06:53.060 --> 1:06:55.920
 to break encryption, that it wouldn't be able to do that,

1:06:55.920 --> 1:06:56.760
 right?

1:06:56.760 --> 1:06:59.200
 So if you have an AI that controls

1:06:59.200 --> 1:07:01.480
 something very important, whatever it is,

1:07:01.480 --> 1:07:03.560
 shipping or something in defense

1:07:03.560 --> 1:07:07.400
 or something in the financial system, whatever it is,

1:07:07.400 --> 1:07:09.060
 but you're sitting there and you're kind of worried,

1:07:09.060 --> 1:07:11.560
 hey, this thing is unbelievable.

1:07:11.560 --> 1:07:13.080
 It's coming up with things

1:07:13.080 --> 1:07:14.980
 we wouldn't have thought of in a hundred years,

1:07:14.980 --> 1:07:17.040
 but maybe it's a little too unbelievable.

1:07:17.920 --> 1:07:19.680
 How do you limit it?

1:07:19.680 --> 1:07:22.720
 Well, if you bake in private keys

1:07:22.720 --> 1:07:27.020
 and you bake in these kind of blockchain based limitations,

1:07:27.020 --> 1:07:28.960
 you can create the conditions

1:07:28.960 --> 1:07:31.640
 beyond which an AI could never act.

1:07:31.640 --> 1:07:33.500
 And those could once again be codified

1:07:33.500 --> 1:07:36.680
 in the very specific unambiguous terms

1:07:36.680 --> 1:07:38.040
 in which you described,

1:07:38.040 --> 1:07:41.660
 which once again, in my trust issue focused world,

1:07:41.660 --> 1:07:45.020
 would solve the trust issue for users

1:07:45.020 --> 1:07:47.880
 and make them comfortable with using the AI

1:07:47.880 --> 1:07:50.760
 or ceding control to the AI,

1:07:50.760 --> 1:07:53.840
 which I think in more advanced versions of AI

1:07:53.840 --> 1:07:55.840
 will continue to be a concern, right?

1:07:55.840 --> 1:07:57.100
 This is fascinating.

1:07:57.100 --> 1:07:59.280
 So smart contracts actually provide a mechanism

1:07:59.280 --> 1:08:01.600
 for human supervision of AI systems.

1:08:01.600 --> 1:08:04.560
 With encryption, very encryption heavy.

1:08:04.560 --> 1:08:07.320
 So it's not about like, is it smarter than us?

1:08:07.320 --> 1:08:09.840
 It's about will the encryption hold up?

1:08:09.840 --> 1:08:10.780
 Yep.

1:08:10.780 --> 1:08:15.040
 So that's based on the assumption that encryption holds up.

1:08:15.040 --> 1:08:16.360
 I think that's a safe assumption.

1:08:16.360 --> 1:08:18.120
 We can get into that whole discussion,

1:08:18.120 --> 1:08:19.960
 but from quantum computing,

1:08:19.960 --> 1:08:22.000
 but cracking encryption is very difficult.

1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:23.680
 That's a whole nother discussion.

1:08:23.680 --> 1:08:25.520
 I think we're safe on the safe ground

1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:29.860
 for quite a long time, assuming encryption holds.

1:08:29.860 --> 1:08:34.860
 I, there's a space that is at the cutting edge

1:08:38.020 --> 1:08:41.400
 of general intelligence research in the AI community,

1:08:41.400 --> 1:08:44.680
 which is the space of program synthesis

1:08:44.680 --> 1:08:47.360
 or AI generating programs.

1:08:47.360 --> 1:08:50.300
 So that's different than what you're referring to

1:08:50.300 --> 1:08:54.800
 is AI being able to generate smart contracts.

1:08:54.800 --> 1:08:59.080
 And that to me is kind of fascinating

1:09:00.400 --> 1:09:03.560
 to think of, especially two AI systems

1:09:03.560 --> 1:09:07.080
 between each other, generating contracts,

1:09:07.080 --> 1:09:10.760
 sort of almost creating a world

1:09:10.760 --> 1:09:15.460
 where most of the contracts are between nonhuman beings.

1:09:15.460 --> 1:09:17.800
 I think an AI system, as I think about it,

1:09:17.800 --> 1:09:19.340
 and once again, this is not my field.

1:09:19.340 --> 1:09:21.320
 This is something I might watch a YouTube video on

1:09:21.320 --> 1:09:25.120
 or just see something interesting about at some point.

1:09:25.120 --> 1:09:28.360
 I think if I were to just reason through it even now,

1:09:29.320 --> 1:09:30.960
 I think the highly deterministic

1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:34.400
 and guaranteed nature of smart contracts

1:09:34.400 --> 1:09:37.920
 would probably be preferable to an AI

1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:41.800
 because I'm guessing an AI would have a lot of problems

1:09:41.800 --> 1:09:43.720
 with dealing with the human element

1:09:43.720 --> 1:09:45.600
 of how contracts work today, right?

1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:48.560
 So an AI, for example, couldn't pick up the phone

1:09:48.560 --> 1:09:53.360
 and call Dave at a bank to do a derivative

1:09:53.360 --> 1:09:55.800
 and kind of discuss with Dave and have a call with him

1:09:55.800 --> 1:09:58.840
 and kind of have a conversation and get him comfortable

1:09:58.840 --> 1:10:00.320
 and tell him it's gonna be fine

1:10:00.320 --> 1:10:03.600
 and kind of smooth out all the weird social cues

1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:06.180
 that have to do with making certain derivatives.

1:10:06.180 --> 1:10:09.920
 I'm assuming that that's a pretty complicated

1:10:09.920 --> 1:10:13.180
 neural map AI kind of problem.

1:10:15.360 --> 1:10:17.240
 Yeah, so if I think about it,

1:10:17.240 --> 1:10:21.120
 the deterministic guaranteed nature of smart contracts

1:10:21.120 --> 1:10:25.120
 probably would, and if, assuming they're accessible to AIs,

1:10:25.120 --> 1:10:28.540
 could actually, interestingly enough, be the format

1:10:28.540 --> 1:10:32.340
 that they prefer to codify their relationship

1:10:32.340 --> 1:10:37.340
 with non AI systems and very possibly other AI systems,

1:10:37.400 --> 1:10:39.760
 right, because it is very,

1:10:41.760 --> 1:10:44.060
 I mean, it's pretty guaranteed, right?

1:10:44.060 --> 1:10:46.040
 All the other types of contracts

1:10:46.040 --> 1:10:50.440
 that an AI could go out there and seek to do

1:10:50.440 --> 1:10:55.440
 would require some language processing around the law.

1:10:56.160 --> 1:10:59.520
 And I think, I don't know if this is a term,

1:10:59.520 --> 1:11:01.640
 but probably not a smart AI or a good AI

1:11:01.640 --> 1:11:04.640
 or whatever the term is for a high quality AI,

1:11:04.640 --> 1:11:08.060
 would probably realize some of the limitations

1:11:08.060 --> 1:11:09.220
 and the risks.

1:11:09.220 --> 1:11:12.000
 Yeah, yeah, AI definitely dislikes ambiguity

1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:14.560
 and would prefer the determinism,

1:11:14.560 --> 1:11:17.520
 the deterministic nature of smart contracts.

1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:19.680
 I do wonder about this particular problem

1:11:19.680 --> 1:11:23.500
 and maybe you could speak to it of how smart contracts

1:11:23.500 --> 1:11:27.960
 can take over certain industries in a sense

1:11:27.960 --> 1:11:31.380
 or how certain industries can convert their sets

1:11:31.380 --> 1:11:34.160
 of agreements into smart contracts,

1:11:34.160 --> 1:11:36.360
 which is, you mentioned sort of talking to Dave

1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:41.040
 from the bank, many of our laws, many of our agreements

1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:46.040
 are currently through natural language, through words.

1:11:46.880 --> 1:11:50.320
 And so there is a process of mapping that has to occur

1:11:50.320 --> 1:11:53.800
 in order to convert the legal agreements,

1:11:53.800 --> 1:11:58.280
 legal contracts of today to smart contracts

1:11:58.280 --> 1:12:01.040
 that by the way, AI may be able to help with.

1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:06.040
 But by way of question, how do you think we convert

1:12:06.100 --> 1:12:09.680
 the legal contracts on which many industries

1:12:09.680 --> 1:12:13.520
 currently function today or not even legal contracts,

1:12:13.520 --> 1:12:15.960
 but ambiguous kind of agreements,

1:12:15.960 --> 1:12:19.440
 maybe they're loose sometimes into more formal

1:12:19.440 --> 1:12:22.840
 deterministic agreements that are represented

1:12:22.840 --> 1:12:23.900
 by smart contracts?

1:12:25.020 --> 1:12:29.380
 So I think there's two, maybe two sides to this.

1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:32.940
 I think the first one is actually not a huge problem

1:12:32.940 --> 1:12:35.280
 where you have things like the is the master agreement

1:12:35.280 --> 1:12:37.580
 for derivatives or you have these agreements

1:12:37.580 --> 1:12:41.080
 that basically already reference a system somewhere,

1:12:41.080 --> 1:12:43.220
 like for example, many legal agreements

1:12:43.220 --> 1:12:45.020
 already accept eSignature.

1:12:45.020 --> 1:12:46.520
 And so they're saying, hey, I'm gonna use

1:12:46.520 --> 1:12:49.320
 this computing system over here around signatures

1:12:49.320 --> 1:12:51.300
 and I'm gonna consider, and there's laws around that

1:12:51.300 --> 1:12:53.640
 and there's clauses that say eSignature is good enough

1:12:53.640 --> 1:12:55.080
 for this agreement.

1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:57.220
 I actually don't think this is a big problem

1:12:57.220 --> 1:12:59.740
 for the vast majority of legal agreements

1:12:59.740 --> 1:13:02.000
 that use systems already.

1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:05.440
 So what you'll do is you'll swap out one repository

1:13:05.440 --> 1:13:09.120
 or one set of system of contract settlement.

1:13:09.120 --> 1:13:11.480
 And you'll just say, hey, this blockchain system over here

1:13:11.480 --> 1:13:13.520
 is my new system of contract settlement.

1:13:13.520 --> 1:13:16.800
 Whatever it says is the state of the agreement

1:13:16.800 --> 1:13:19.520
 instead of the centralized system over there.

1:13:20.440 --> 1:13:22.260
 And so there's actually a huge amount of agreements

1:13:22.260 --> 1:13:24.840
 that are already able to do that

1:13:24.840 --> 1:13:26.680
 and I think we'll do that.

1:13:26.680 --> 1:13:28.840
 I think there's another side to your question,

1:13:28.840 --> 1:13:33.840
 which is the amount of agreements that are very ambiguous

1:13:33.840 --> 1:13:36.120
 that can be turned into smart contracts.

1:13:36.120 --> 1:13:39.280
 And I think the limitation there is twofold.

1:13:39.280 --> 1:13:41.740
 First of all, like you said earlier,

1:13:41.740 --> 1:13:44.120
 the highly reliable smart contract

1:13:44.120 --> 1:13:46.560
 and the lack of opaqueness and the clarity

1:13:46.560 --> 1:13:51.560
 of smart contracts is very high and very powerful

1:13:52.120 --> 1:13:54.800
 and very clear and it's, in my opinion,

1:13:54.800 --> 1:13:58.360
 gonna be much, much easier to take a smart contract

1:13:58.360 --> 1:14:01.680
 and turn it into a set of natural language explanations

1:14:01.680 --> 1:14:05.600
 and just say, hey, this is what this does, right?

1:14:05.600 --> 1:14:08.280
 So I think that many contracts are,

1:14:08.280 --> 1:14:11.000
 and even now in decentralized finance and DeFi

1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:12.000
 and in decentralized insurance,

1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:14.820
 they're basically being rebuilt in this format

1:14:14.820 --> 1:14:18.200
 and that rebuilding will make them clearer, like you said,

1:14:18.200 --> 1:14:20.240
 and then restating those in natural language

1:14:20.240 --> 1:14:21.680
 and explaining to people, well, you know,

1:14:21.680 --> 1:14:24.340
 whether it is this, I think it'll actually be a lot simpler

1:14:24.340 --> 1:14:26.040
 to explain to people what the contract is about.

1:14:26.040 --> 1:14:27.160
 It's fascinating.

1:14:27.160 --> 1:14:29.180
 Mapping smart contracts into natural language,

1:14:29.180 --> 1:14:30.240
 I didn't even think about that.

1:14:30.240 --> 1:14:33.400
 So that's, you're saying that's doable

1:14:33.400 --> 1:14:35.960
 and natural and easy to do.

1:14:35.960 --> 1:14:37.680
 Because there's so much clear, right?

1:14:37.680 --> 1:14:40.040
 There's that forced clarity that you talked about.

1:14:40.040 --> 1:14:42.840
 I think the second aspect of this problem

1:14:42.840 --> 1:14:47.680
 is the nuance around what contracts can be made unambiguous

1:14:47.680 --> 1:14:49.280
 and I think that comes down to,

1:14:49.280 --> 1:14:51.960
 often comes down to proving what happened,

1:14:51.960 --> 1:14:53.240
 which is where Oracle networks

1:14:53.240 --> 1:14:56.100
 and decentralized Oracle networks and Chainlink would come in

1:14:56.100 --> 1:14:58.740
 and our experience there is quite extensive

1:14:58.740 --> 1:15:00.720
 over the many years that we've worked on many different

1:15:00.720 --> 1:15:02.320
 contract types.

1:15:02.320 --> 1:15:05.560
 I think what it fundamentally comes down to

1:15:05.560 --> 1:15:07.640
 is whether there is data.

1:15:07.640 --> 1:15:11.520
 So we're not gonna be able to make a hybrid smart contract

1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:13.240
 about whether somebody painted your house

1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:15.040
 the right color blue.

1:15:15.040 --> 1:15:16.360
 We're just not gonna be doing that

1:15:16.360 --> 1:15:18.480
 because there's no data feed that tells us

1:15:18.480 --> 1:15:19.760
 that your house was painted blue

1:15:19.760 --> 1:15:22.200
 or that it was the right color of blue.

1:15:22.200 --> 1:15:24.160
 You know, unless somebody sets up a drone

1:15:24.160 --> 1:15:28.220
 with a color analysis tool and they generate that data.

1:15:28.220 --> 1:15:29.960
 Which by the way, it could be possible, right?

1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:32.240
 They could, there could be, if there's enough demand

1:15:32.240 --> 1:15:33.800
 then the service would be created

1:15:33.800 --> 1:15:35.500
 that has drones flying around

1:15:35.500 --> 1:15:38.040
 that's telling you about the colors of, you know,

1:15:38.040 --> 1:15:38.920
 all this kind of stuff.

1:15:38.920 --> 1:15:41.560
 So if there's actual demand that that would be created

1:15:41.560 --> 1:15:44.660
 and because there'll be value to connect that data feed

1:15:44.660 --> 1:15:46.360
 to the smart contracts and so on.

1:15:46.360 --> 1:15:48.640
 I think you have it unbelievably right

1:15:48.640 --> 1:15:51.060
 because there are already insurance companies

1:15:51.060 --> 1:15:54.400
 that use drones to monitor construction sites from overhead

1:15:54.400 --> 1:15:57.120
 and see how many people are wearing hard hats.

1:15:57.120 --> 1:15:59.120
 And if the percentage of people wearing hard hats

1:15:59.120 --> 1:16:01.180
 isn't sufficiently high, then, you know,

1:16:01.180 --> 1:16:02.720
 the policy is voided.

1:16:02.720 --> 1:16:05.240
 And so in that case, there is a data source

1:16:05.240 --> 1:16:06.680
 and that data source can be put

1:16:06.680 --> 1:16:08.360
 into a hybrid smart contract.

1:16:08.360 --> 1:16:11.040
 So the limitation of hybrid smart contracts is,

1:16:11.040 --> 1:16:13.820
 is there a data source or a set of data sources

1:16:13.820 --> 1:16:15.640
 to create definitive truth,

1:16:15.640 --> 1:16:18.960
 to settle the contract and eliminate ambiguity.

1:16:18.960 --> 1:16:22.520
 And then as you said, I think as people realize

1:16:22.520 --> 1:16:24.800
 that smart contracts are a format

1:16:24.800 --> 1:16:27.240
 in which they can form agreement about things

1:16:27.240 --> 1:16:29.320
 like that insurance product around, you know,

1:16:29.320 --> 1:16:31.200
 how many people are wearing hard hats.

1:16:31.200 --> 1:16:33.760
 If I'm the construction site owner, well, you know,

1:16:33.760 --> 1:16:35.640
 I would really like a guarantee

1:16:35.640 --> 1:16:38.880
 that your insurance policy is gonna pay me out

1:16:38.880 --> 1:16:40.780
 if everyone is wearing hard hats.

1:16:40.780 --> 1:16:44.560
 And in that case, there is demand for the data

1:16:44.560 --> 1:16:46.520
 and people will generate the data.

1:16:46.520 --> 1:16:48.480
 And I actually think the insurance industry

1:16:48.480 --> 1:16:50.080
 is interestingly a precursor of this

1:16:50.080 --> 1:16:51.640
 because they're so data driven.

1:16:51.640 --> 1:16:56.040
 You already see insurance companies paying IoT companies

1:16:56.040 --> 1:16:59.080
 to put data into their customer's infrastructure

1:16:59.080 --> 1:17:01.320
 at the cost of the insurance company

1:17:01.320 --> 1:17:03.840
 to generate the data that the insurance company uses

1:17:03.840 --> 1:17:05.780
 to make a policy for the customer.

1:17:05.780 --> 1:17:08.240
 So you basically already have people

1:17:08.240 --> 1:17:12.200
 who really want to price data into their agreements

1:17:12.200 --> 1:17:15.200
 when they're of sufficiently high value paying

1:17:15.200 --> 1:17:18.820
 for their own customers to get data sensors

1:17:18.820 --> 1:17:20.600
 into their infrastructure.

1:17:20.600 --> 1:17:23.400
 And I think as smart contracts become more

1:17:23.400 --> 1:17:26.800
 of a requested format or data driven contracts

1:17:26.800 --> 1:17:28.240
 become more of a format,

1:17:28.240 --> 1:17:31.160
 there will be a growing demand

1:17:31.160 --> 1:17:33.680
 about proving what happened through data.

1:17:33.680 --> 1:17:36.820
 So it'll be motivating totally new data feeds being created.

1:17:36.820 --> 1:17:40.240
 By the way, the insurance industry broadly,

1:17:40.240 --> 1:17:42.800
 the revolutions there, it would be huge.

1:17:42.800 --> 1:17:44.720
 I've worked quite a bit with autonomous vehicles,

1:17:44.720 --> 1:17:47.700
 semi autonomous and just vehicles in general.

1:17:47.700 --> 1:17:49.680
 The insurance industry there, by the way,

1:17:49.680 --> 1:17:51.520
 makes a huge amount of money,

1:17:51.520 --> 1:17:54.460
 but is using very crappy data feeds,

1:17:56.160 --> 1:18:00.160
 revolutionizing how like not by crappy,

1:18:00.160 --> 1:18:01.520
 I mean very crude.

1:18:01.520 --> 1:18:06.300
 Like literally the insurance is based on things like age,

1:18:06.300 --> 1:18:09.080
 gender, like basic demographic information

1:18:09.080 --> 1:18:13.320
 as opposed to really high resolution information

1:18:13.320 --> 1:18:15.280
 about you as an individual,

1:18:15.280 --> 1:18:18.160
 which you may or may not want to provide.

1:18:18.160 --> 1:18:20.320
 So you can choose from an individual perspective

1:18:20.320 --> 1:18:21.400
 to provide a data feed.

1:18:21.400 --> 1:18:26.400
 And there like the power of insurance

1:18:30.500 --> 1:18:33.480
 to enable the individual,

1:18:33.480 --> 1:18:36.720
 to empower the individual could be huge

1:18:36.720 --> 1:18:40.460
 because ultimately smart contracts motivate the use of data,

1:18:40.460 --> 1:18:42.160
 the creation of new data feeds,

1:18:42.160 --> 1:18:47.160
 but leveraging the whatever service it provides in truth,

1:18:48.760 --> 1:18:52.680
 as opposed to some kind of very loose notion of who you are.

1:18:52.680 --> 1:18:55.240
 So that I'm not, again,

1:18:55.240 --> 1:18:57.200
 not sure how that would change things,

1:18:57.200 --> 1:19:02.200
 but in terms of the fundamental experience of life,

1:19:02.360 --> 1:19:04.040
 because I think we all rely on insurance,

1:19:04.040 --> 1:19:06.160
 not just in business, but in life

1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:09.300
 and grounding that insurance

1:19:09.300 --> 1:19:13.320
 in more and more accurate representation of reality

1:19:13.320 --> 1:19:15.940
 might just have transformative effects on society.

1:19:15.940 --> 1:19:18.840
 Well, just to mention one quick thing that you said,

1:19:18.840 --> 1:19:20.560
 where I noticed another trust issue,

1:19:20.560 --> 1:19:23.720
 you said the user might not want to share their data.

1:19:23.720 --> 1:19:25.140
 So what you could actually do,

1:19:25.140 --> 1:19:26.980
 and what we've already worked on is,

1:19:26.980 --> 1:19:30.240
 you can have a smart contract that holds the data

1:19:30.240 --> 1:19:32.900
 and evaluates the data of the user

1:19:32.900 --> 1:19:35.480
 without sharing it with the insurance companies.

1:19:35.480 --> 1:19:38.080
 And the insurance company knows that the smart contract

1:19:38.080 --> 1:19:40.520
 will evaluate it according to the policy.

1:19:40.520 --> 1:19:41.880
 They don't need the data.

1:19:41.880 --> 1:19:45.280
 And the user can provide the data

1:19:45.280 --> 1:19:47.200
 knowing it'll never touch the insurance company

1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:49.860
 because it's only provided to the smart contract.

1:19:49.860 --> 1:19:52.480
 And suddenly you've solved another trust issue

1:19:52.480 --> 1:19:54.520
 because the autonomous piece of code

1:19:54.520 --> 1:19:58.280
 can evaluate information separately from the interests

1:19:58.280 --> 1:20:00.320
 of both of the counterparties.

1:20:00.320 --> 1:20:02.040
 And so this is the recurring theme.

1:20:02.040 --> 1:20:03.580
 I think you're seeing this recurring theme

1:20:03.580 --> 1:20:05.280
 where there's a trust issue,

1:20:05.280 --> 1:20:07.840
 people can't use the system, they can't collaborate,

1:20:07.840 --> 1:20:09.280
 they can't share information

1:20:09.280 --> 1:20:11.240
 that would make a better agreement for both of them,

1:20:11.240 --> 1:20:14.640
 they can't solve a risk in their daily life,

1:20:14.640 --> 1:20:16.260
 they can't participate in a market,

1:20:16.260 --> 1:20:17.560
 they can't have a bank account

1:20:17.560 --> 1:20:18.600
 because nobody will give it to them

1:20:18.600 --> 1:20:22.000
 because they can't give it to them in that legal system.

1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:25.360
 And once you have an autonomous piece of code

1:20:25.360 --> 1:20:27.920
 that can also know what's going on,

1:20:27.920 --> 1:20:30.580
 thanks to Oracle networks and that combination of the code

1:20:30.580 --> 1:20:33.280
 and the Oracle network for the hybrid smart contract,

1:20:34.240 --> 1:20:36.720
 the same pattern just recurs.

1:20:36.720 --> 1:20:38.160
 It's really the same pattern.

1:20:38.160 --> 1:20:40.720
 And this is why I keep saying trust issues.

1:20:40.720 --> 1:20:43.080
 It's because I basically,

1:20:43.080 --> 1:20:45.780
 almost every contractual trust issue that I see

1:20:45.780 --> 1:20:47.620
 where there is a piece of data to prove

1:20:47.620 --> 1:20:49.740
 and settle the trust issue

1:20:49.740 --> 1:20:51.640
 in a way that works for both parties,

1:20:53.320 --> 1:20:55.840
 there is no reason not to use an autonomous,

1:20:55.840 --> 1:20:59.600
 highly reliable contract and piece of code.

1:20:59.600 --> 1:21:01.240
 And I have to tell you,

1:21:01.240 --> 1:21:04.080
 I've seen this in a lot of different industries.

1:21:04.080 --> 1:21:07.120
 I've seen it insurance, ad networks,

1:21:07.120 --> 1:21:09.200
 global finance, global trade,

1:21:09.200 --> 1:21:11.760
 those are all multi trillion dollar industries.

1:21:11.760 --> 1:21:14.040
 And then there are other smaller industries.

1:21:14.040 --> 1:21:16.240
 Like even one of the first smart contracts

1:21:16.240 --> 1:21:17.760
 we worked on many years ago

1:21:17.760 --> 1:21:20.640
 was for search engine optimization firms

1:21:20.640 --> 1:21:21.640
 where they would tell you,

1:21:21.640 --> 1:21:24.160
 hey, I'm gonna raise your search engine ranking,

1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:25.520
 give me the money.

1:21:25.520 --> 1:21:26.920
 And people wouldn't wanna give them the money

1:21:26.920 --> 1:21:29.760
 because they never knew if they were gonna do it.

1:21:29.760 --> 1:21:30.840
 And then the search engine firm

1:21:30.840 --> 1:21:31.740
 doesn't wanna do any work

1:21:31.740 --> 1:21:33.600
 thinking they'll never get any money.

1:21:33.600 --> 1:21:36.200
 So we just initially even came up with a system

1:21:36.200 --> 1:21:38.960
 where you could put Bitcoin into a smart contract

1:21:38.960 --> 1:21:42.480
 and it would be released based on whether the search rank

1:21:42.480 --> 1:21:45.000
 of a website got to a certain level on Google

1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:47.080
 for a certain keyword, right?

1:21:47.080 --> 1:21:49.140
 And so the trust problem was solved.

1:21:49.140 --> 1:21:50.740
 But it's just the same story, right?

1:21:50.740 --> 1:21:52.560
 It's kind of like trust issues around AI,

1:21:52.560 --> 1:21:54.200
 trust issues around financial products,

1:21:54.200 --> 1:21:55.480
 trust issues around insurance,

1:21:55.480 --> 1:21:58.960
 trust issues around social media, whatever it is.

1:21:58.960 --> 1:22:03.960
 I think that's what people looking at this industry

1:22:04.500 --> 1:22:06.140
 really need to understand.

1:22:06.140 --> 1:22:07.200
 And once they do understand,

1:22:07.200 --> 1:22:09.440
 they realize what this is all about.

1:22:09.440 --> 1:22:14.240
 This is about redefining how everyone collaborates

1:22:14.240 --> 1:22:17.360
 with everyone about everything

1:22:17.360 --> 1:22:20.000
 where we can prove something through data.

1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:23.520
 You've mentioned confidentiality and privacy

1:22:23.520 --> 1:22:27.520
 that the parties don't need to necessarily know private data

1:22:27.520 --> 1:22:28.360
 in this interaction.

1:22:28.360 --> 1:22:32.360
 You talk about confidentiality in the white paper

1:22:32.360 --> 1:22:33.940
 for Chainlink 2.0.

1:22:33.940 --> 1:22:38.080
 Can you talk more about how to achieve confidentiality

1:22:38.080 --> 1:22:39.000
 in this process?

1:22:39.860 --> 1:22:41.740
 Sure, sure, absolutely.

1:22:43.220 --> 1:22:45.560
 So I think you once again need to think of the contract

1:22:45.560 --> 1:22:47.020
 as existing in two parts, right?

1:22:47.020 --> 1:22:48.340
 You have the on chain code

1:22:48.340 --> 1:22:49.880
 and then you have this off chain system

1:22:49.880 --> 1:22:51.840
 called the centralized Oracle network.

1:22:52.740 --> 1:22:56.720
 So the question is really what portion of the contract

1:22:56.720 --> 1:23:00.680
 should live in what part of these two systems, right?

1:23:00.680 --> 1:23:03.720
 So if you wanna create transparency,

1:23:03.720 --> 1:23:06.960
 you should put more information on chain

1:23:06.960 --> 1:23:09.240
 because that's what blockchains are very good at.

1:23:09.240 --> 1:23:12.240
 They're public, transparent,

1:23:12.240 --> 1:23:15.000
 but they don't necessarily have privacy.

1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:16.700
 Well, you can see how those two things

1:23:16.700 --> 1:23:21.440
 are a little bit kind of completely diametrically opposed.

1:23:21.440 --> 1:23:25.360
 So I do think and I do see blockchains working

1:23:25.360 --> 1:23:28.800
 on on chain encrypted smart contracts.

1:23:28.800 --> 1:23:29.980
 That's very inefficient.

1:23:29.980 --> 1:23:32.640
 It has a lot of nuances around it.

1:23:32.640 --> 1:23:35.060
 That I think will appear at some point.

1:23:35.060 --> 1:23:37.320
 I think until it appears,

1:23:37.320 --> 1:23:41.580
 you have an option of taking a part of the computation

1:23:41.580 --> 1:23:44.800
 and putting it into the centralized Oracle network.

1:23:44.800 --> 1:23:47.160
 We actually did an entire paper about this

1:23:47.160 --> 1:23:51.200
 that we presented at Stanford in February of last year,

1:23:52.200 --> 1:23:53.420
 something called Mixicles,

1:23:53.420 --> 1:23:55.640
 which basically talks about how you can take

1:23:55.640 --> 1:23:58.380
 an Oracle network and you can put a portion

1:23:58.380 --> 1:24:01.080
 of the computation into the Oracle network,

1:24:01.080 --> 1:24:04.160
 assuming that you're comfortable with that limited set

1:24:04.160 --> 1:24:07.060
 of nodes knowing what the computation is.

1:24:07.060 --> 1:24:09.760
 And you could actually provide additional confidentiality

1:24:09.760 --> 1:24:11.060
 through special hardware

1:24:11.060 --> 1:24:12.920
 called trusted execution environments

1:24:12.920 --> 1:24:15.320
 that all those nodes are forced to run.

1:24:15.320 --> 1:24:17.900
 So they won't even know what they're operating.

1:24:17.900 --> 1:24:19.600
 And so at the end of the day,

1:24:19.600 --> 1:24:22.160
 if you look at a hybrid smart contract

1:24:22.160 --> 1:24:24.680
 as gaining functionality from its on chain code

1:24:24.680 --> 1:24:26.160
 and gaining other functionality

1:24:26.160 --> 1:24:30.520
 from its off chain decentralized Oracle network component,

1:24:30.520 --> 1:24:32.840
 you can place the part of the computation

1:24:32.840 --> 1:24:34.600
 that you would like to be private

1:24:34.600 --> 1:24:37.280
 in the decentralized Oracle network,

1:24:37.280 --> 1:24:40.800
 because you can control the set of nodes.

1:24:40.800 --> 1:24:42.820
 You can control the committee of nodes

1:24:42.820 --> 1:24:46.120
 and you can require that they run certain hardware

1:24:46.120 --> 1:24:48.000
 to keep the information private, right?

1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:50.760
 So you could basically make a derivative that,

1:24:50.760 --> 1:24:52.560
 or a binary option is the example used

1:24:52.560 --> 1:24:57.200
 in the Mixicles paper where the payout happened on chain,

1:24:57.200 --> 1:24:59.680
 but it was actually impossible to tell

1:24:59.680 --> 1:25:02.400
 what the outcome of the contract was.

1:25:02.400 --> 1:25:04.820
 So the outcome of the contract was computed

1:25:04.820 --> 1:25:06.560
 in the centralized Oracle network.

1:25:06.560 --> 1:25:08.680
 And then there was a switch that triggered

1:25:08.680 --> 1:25:10.440
 who received the payment,

1:25:10.440 --> 1:25:13.760
 but from the point of view of analyzing

1:25:13.760 --> 1:25:18.760
 the on chain transactions and seeing who received

1:25:18.760 --> 1:25:21.480
 the payment or what the outcome of the contract was,

1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:24.000
 you couldn't derive that,

1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:26.400
 you couldn't backward engineer what that was,

1:25:26.400 --> 1:25:30.160
 but the users of that hybrid smart contract

1:25:30.160 --> 1:25:33.560
 still had on chain code that guaranteed them

1:25:33.560 --> 1:25:36.080
 that as long as the decentralized Oracle network

1:25:36.080 --> 1:25:37.920
 found a certain outcome, right?

1:25:37.920 --> 1:25:39.540
 Determined a certain outcome

1:25:39.540 --> 1:25:42.080
 that the relevant user would get paid

1:25:42.080 --> 1:25:45.680
 and there was still a place to put value, right?

1:25:45.680 --> 1:25:49.360
 So there is this kind of fundamental tension

1:25:49.360 --> 1:25:52.400
 between confidentiality, privacy,

1:25:52.400 --> 1:25:54.240
 which is very important for many contracts,

1:25:54.240 --> 1:25:56.160
 which is critical to many contracts

1:25:56.160 --> 1:25:59.560
 and the public and transparent nature of blockchains,

1:25:59.560 --> 1:26:01.920
 which I think eventually will be solved

1:26:01.920 --> 1:26:04.720
 through encrypted on chain smart contracts.

1:26:04.720 --> 1:26:05.920
 That'll take some time,

1:26:05.920 --> 1:26:08.240
 I think that'll take years in my opinion.

1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:11.000
 And before we arrive there,

1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:13.120
 I think people will put the private portion

1:26:13.120 --> 1:26:15.080
 into the centralized Oracle network.

1:26:15.080 --> 1:26:16.760
 Once again, going back to what

1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:19.080
 the decentralized Oracle networks do,

1:26:19.080 --> 1:26:21.660
 they seek to provide these services, right?

1:26:21.660 --> 1:26:25.360
 So the ability to do a privacy preserving computation

1:26:25.360 --> 1:26:28.160
 is perhaps a service without which

1:26:28.160 --> 1:26:31.480
 a certain type of contract might never come into existence

1:26:31.480 --> 1:26:34.560
 in the form of an on chain hybrid smart contract.

1:26:34.560 --> 1:26:35.920
 And so this is once again,

1:26:35.920 --> 1:26:38.240
 what we see the centralized Oracle networks

1:26:38.240 --> 1:26:40.040
 and decentralized services doing

1:26:40.040 --> 1:26:43.060
 is providing people these tools and building blocks

1:26:43.060 --> 1:26:46.760
 to compose, like I'm great at making

1:26:46.760 --> 1:26:48.000
 these derivatives contracts,

1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:50.360
 but I can't make them unless I can retain

1:26:50.360 --> 1:26:52.200
 the privacy of them.

1:26:52.200 --> 1:26:56.120
 And our goal is to provide the infrastructure

1:26:56.120 --> 1:26:57.680
 that gives you as a developer

1:26:57.680 --> 1:27:00.940
 and as a creator of smart contracts, that capability.

1:27:00.940 --> 1:27:03.680
 And what we've seen is that as we provide that capability,

1:27:03.680 --> 1:27:04.920
 people create more,

1:27:04.920 --> 1:27:07.240
 which is also really the story of the internet, right?

1:27:07.240 --> 1:27:09.520
 The story of the internet is it was really tough

1:27:09.520 --> 1:27:13.200
 to do eCommerce while everything was an HTTP

1:27:13.200 --> 1:27:15.760
 and credit cards were transmitted publicly.

1:27:15.760 --> 1:27:17.240
 And so eCommerce was kind of tough

1:27:17.240 --> 1:27:18.880
 because how am I gonna send my credit card

1:27:18.880 --> 1:27:21.400
 over public on encrypted channels, right?

1:27:21.400 --> 1:27:23.280
 But the second HTTPS appears,

1:27:23.280 --> 1:27:24.920
 eCommerce becomes a lot easier

1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:26.920
 because I can put in my credit card number

1:27:26.920 --> 1:27:29.120
 and it can be sent over an encrypted channel

1:27:29.120 --> 1:27:30.500
 and it's not at risk.

1:27:30.500 --> 1:27:32.000
 And so I can participate in eCommerce

1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:33.680
 as long as I have a credit card.

1:27:33.680 --> 1:27:36.880
 I think those types, and I'm sure that was unexpected,

1:27:36.880 --> 1:27:40.120
 right, I'm sure at the time that was an unexpected outcome

1:27:40.120 --> 1:27:42.000
 from that technology.

1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:45.440
 And so I think this is why we sometimes have this focus

1:27:45.440 --> 1:27:48.560
 on privacy because in our work with contracts

1:27:48.560 --> 1:27:51.760
 and their transition into this hybrid smart contract form,

1:27:51.760 --> 1:27:55.780
 we see a substantial amount of need for privacy

1:27:55.780 --> 1:27:59.860
 as an inherent property of these contracts.

1:27:59.860 --> 1:28:01.880
 And it'll take a while before that's possible

1:28:01.880 --> 1:28:04.480
 to create the kind of technology innovation required

1:28:04.480 --> 1:28:05.600
 to do that on chain.

1:28:05.600 --> 1:28:07.880
 I know there's a few ideas that are being floating about,

1:28:07.880 --> 1:28:10.820
 but so the currently distributed Oracle networks

1:28:10.820 --> 1:28:14.280
 provide that feature, which is essential to many contracts.

1:28:14.280 --> 1:28:16.880
 What brings to mind in this whole space,

1:28:16.880 --> 1:28:20.240
 again, it might be outside of your expertise,

1:28:20.240 --> 1:28:23.520
 but within the world which I'm passionate about,

1:28:23.520 --> 1:28:25.120
 which is machine learning,

1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:27.860
 and it seems like very naturally

1:28:27.860 --> 1:28:31.280
 because current machine learning systems

1:28:31.280 --> 1:28:33.320
 are very data hungry

1:28:33.320 --> 1:28:37.900
 and much of the value mined by companies

1:28:37.900 --> 1:28:40.400
 in the digital space are from data.

1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:44.880
 They often want their data to maintain privacy.

1:28:44.880 --> 1:28:47.500
 So you think about an autonomous vehicle space,

1:28:47.500 --> 1:28:49.520
 Tesla is collecting a huge amount of data,

1:28:49.520 --> 1:28:53.160
 Waymo is collecting a huge amount of data.

1:28:53.160 --> 1:28:54.760
 It seems like it would be very beneficial

1:28:54.760 --> 1:28:57.200
 to form contracts where one could use the data

1:28:57.200 --> 1:29:00.720
 from the other in some kind of privacy preserving way,

1:29:00.720 --> 1:29:05.720
 but also where all the uses of data are codified

1:29:05.880 --> 1:29:08.560
 and you can exchange value cleanly,

1:29:08.560 --> 1:29:10.720
 basically contracts over data,

1:29:10.720 --> 1:29:15.720
 over machine learning systems use of different data.

1:29:15.840 --> 1:29:19.200
 I don't know, do you talk to machine learning folks

1:29:19.200 --> 1:29:21.480
 that use ideas of smart contracts

1:29:21.480 --> 1:29:23.320
 or is that for outside of your interest?

1:29:23.320 --> 1:29:27.460
 Because it seems like exceptionally applicable set of,

1:29:27.460 --> 1:29:29.120
 when we talk about different services

1:29:29.120 --> 1:29:33.360
 that might be created and revolutionized by smart,

1:29:33.360 --> 1:29:36.200
 especially hybrid smart contracts,

1:29:36.200 --> 1:29:40.120
 I think machine learning systems comes to mind to me

1:29:40.120 --> 1:29:42.200
 in all industries.

1:29:42.200 --> 1:29:43.520
 I don't know if you've gotten a chance

1:29:43.520 --> 1:29:46.680
 to interact with those folks, with those services.

1:29:46.680 --> 1:29:49.160
 I think what you're talking about is more data marketplaces

1:29:49.160 --> 1:29:51.740
 in the data marketplace side of things.

1:29:52.860 --> 1:29:55.360
 Well, this is actually once again, very applicable

1:29:55.360 --> 1:29:56.760
 because there's a trust issue.

1:29:56.760 --> 1:29:58.400
 At the end of the day,

1:29:58.400 --> 1:30:00.560
 let's say I'm trying to sell you some data.

1:30:00.560 --> 1:30:03.000
 You don't know the quality of the data.

1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:04.720
 So you don't know what you wanna pay for it.

1:30:04.720 --> 1:30:06.540
 And I can't give you the data for you

1:30:06.540 --> 1:30:07.520
 to determine the quality

1:30:07.520 --> 1:30:09.880
 because I've given you the data, right?

1:30:09.880 --> 1:30:10.720
 Guess what?

1:30:10.720 --> 1:30:13.680
 We need an autonomous impartial agent.

1:30:13.680 --> 1:30:17.160
 We need an impartial computational kind of agent

1:30:17.160 --> 1:30:20.920
 and on chain smart contract with an Oracle network

1:30:20.920 --> 1:30:23.320
 to assess my data to write,

1:30:23.320 --> 1:30:28.320
 to basically take random cross section samples of the data,

1:30:28.320 --> 1:30:31.920
 assess it for quality, assess it for signal

1:30:31.920 --> 1:30:33.560
 from the algorithm you have,

1:30:33.560 --> 1:30:35.200
 which you don't wanna share with me

1:30:35.200 --> 1:30:36.400
 because you don't wanna know the algorithm

1:30:36.400 --> 1:30:37.760
 you're working on, right?

1:30:37.760 --> 1:30:40.880
 You don't want me to know what you want the data for.

1:30:40.880 --> 1:30:44.120
 So now the autonomous agent takes your algorithm,

1:30:44.120 --> 1:30:46.020
 keeping it private from me and takes my data,

1:30:46.020 --> 1:30:47.720
 keeping it private from you,

1:30:47.720 --> 1:30:50.680
 assesses it on a random cross section sampling

1:30:50.680 --> 1:30:54.700
 for quality of data, returns the scoring back to you,

1:30:54.700 --> 1:30:57.480
 allows you to determine a price.

1:30:57.480 --> 1:31:00.400
 And now both you and me know that we've arrived

1:31:00.400 --> 1:31:03.680
 at a fair price for the quality of my data

1:31:03.680 --> 1:31:05.620
 for what you wanna do with it.

1:31:06.840 --> 1:31:09.400
 And that's once again,

1:31:09.400 --> 1:31:12.180
 from what I've seen in the data marketplaces,

1:31:12.180 --> 1:31:14.680
 which are full of people who want that data

1:31:14.680 --> 1:31:17.400
 for these learning models, often for financial markets,

1:31:17.400 --> 1:31:20.240
 often for other reasons,

1:31:20.240 --> 1:31:22.240
 this is their fundamental problem,

1:31:22.240 --> 1:31:24.440
 which amazingly enough,

1:31:24.440 --> 1:31:28.080
 there's a trust issue that is getting solved.

1:31:28.080 --> 1:31:31.160
 And I think you can see even on the face of it,

1:31:31.160 --> 1:31:33.640
 once that trust issue is solved,

1:31:33.640 --> 1:31:36.680
 those markets can work a lot better, right?

1:31:36.680 --> 1:31:38.000
 I don't need to know your algorithm.

1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:39.560
 You don't need to know my data.

1:31:39.560 --> 1:31:41.920
 We both know that the autonomous agent

1:31:41.920 --> 1:31:43.680
 is not under either of our control

1:31:43.680 --> 1:31:46.360
 and gave us a fair assessment and a fair price.

1:31:46.360 --> 1:31:47.960
 And that's it.

1:31:47.960 --> 1:31:50.960
 And we're all very comfortable with that.

1:31:50.960 --> 1:31:52.560
 I could even make conditions

1:31:52.560 --> 1:31:55.360
 that your algorithm isn't analyzing the data

1:31:55.360 --> 1:31:57.160
 for something I don't want you to analyze it for,

1:31:57.160 --> 1:31:59.000
 or you could make conditions

1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:02.440
 that the data has to have any number of properties.

1:32:02.440 --> 1:32:05.160
 And once again, you haven't leaked any signal to me

1:32:05.160 --> 1:32:07.480
 and I haven't leaked any data to you,

1:32:07.480 --> 1:32:09.120
 which is once again,

1:32:09.120 --> 1:32:12.280
 just another type of trust issue that all of this solve.

1:32:12.280 --> 1:32:14.200
 So it's the same pattern.

1:32:14.200 --> 1:32:15.840
 If you work in this industry long enough,

1:32:15.840 --> 1:32:18.440
 or if you really look at these use cases long enough,

1:32:18.440 --> 1:32:20.080
 you'll simply come to the question,

1:32:20.080 --> 1:32:22.280
 and this is the useful question,

1:32:22.280 --> 1:32:24.800
 what is the trust issue this is solving?

1:32:24.800 --> 1:32:27.160
 And then if you can get an answer to that question

1:32:27.160 --> 1:32:28.960
 on a case by case basis,

1:32:28.960 --> 1:32:32.640
 that's when you'll understand why blockchains are relevant.

1:32:32.640 --> 1:32:35.240
 And then once you do that with enough use cases,

1:32:35.240 --> 1:32:38.640
 it becomes a little bit mind blank.

1:32:38.640 --> 1:32:40.600
 You've mentioned trust quite a bit.

1:32:40.600 --> 1:32:45.600
 You also mentioned trust minimization

1:32:45.880 --> 1:32:47.600
 in the Chainlink White Paper.

1:32:48.920 --> 1:32:51.600
 Can we dig into trust a little bit more?

1:32:51.600 --> 1:32:53.800
 What is the nature of trust

1:32:53.800 --> 1:32:56.120
 that you think about in these smart contracts?

1:32:56.120 --> 1:32:58.160
 What is trust minimization?

1:32:58.160 --> 1:33:01.140
 How do we accomplish, achieve trust minimization?

1:33:02.160 --> 1:33:03.000
 Sure, sure.

1:33:03.000 --> 1:33:05.640
 I think it's important maybe to have a conception

1:33:05.640 --> 1:33:07.440
 of what the alternative is, right?

1:33:07.440 --> 1:33:11.640
 What is highly reliable trust minimized off chain

1:33:11.640 --> 1:33:14.080
 and on chain computation and alternative to?

1:33:14.080 --> 1:33:17.000
 So this is just kind of how I see the world

1:33:17.000 --> 1:33:18.960
 in these two camps.

1:33:18.960 --> 1:33:20.760
 One camp is the traditional,

1:33:20.760 --> 1:33:25.240
 what I call brand based or paper guarantee camp.

1:33:25.240 --> 1:33:27.520
 And this is the world as pretty much most

1:33:27.520 --> 1:33:29.120
 or all people know today.

1:33:29.120 --> 1:33:31.400
 This is the world where there's a bank logo

1:33:31.400 --> 1:33:34.160
 or an insurance company logo, or some kind of logo.

1:33:34.160 --> 1:33:36.460
 There's a very big building with marble arches

1:33:36.460 --> 1:33:39.440
 and columns, it's the biggest building in the town.

1:33:39.440 --> 1:33:40.980
 It's bigger than the church.

1:33:40.980 --> 1:33:42.360
 And everybody feels very good.

1:33:42.360 --> 1:33:43.720
 Everybody's got such a nice logo.

1:33:43.720 --> 1:33:45.240
 It's such a big building.

1:33:45.240 --> 1:33:47.640
 Why don't I give them my money?

1:33:47.640 --> 1:33:49.760
 Why don't I interact with them on the basis

1:33:49.760 --> 1:33:51.820
 of any kind of agreement?

1:33:51.820 --> 1:33:52.900
 And that's good.

1:33:52.900 --> 1:33:56.120
 And that is definitely better than that not being there.

1:33:56.120 --> 1:33:57.980
 And that is definitely a huge improvement

1:33:57.980 --> 1:34:00.280
 for how people conduct commerce.

1:34:00.280 --> 1:34:04.140
 Letters of credit from branded entities

1:34:04.140 --> 1:34:06.760
 are very important for global trade to take place

1:34:06.760 --> 1:34:09.360
 in the early stages of global trade.

1:34:09.360 --> 1:34:13.480
 So that's good, but it is fundamentally

1:34:13.480 --> 1:34:16.800
 just a paper agreement with a legal framework behind it.

1:34:16.800 --> 1:34:20.680
 And if the paper agreement you have would say Robinhood

1:34:20.680 --> 1:34:24.000
 or somebody else suddenly has to change,

1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:26.520
 well, it changes and you can't really do anything about it.

1:34:26.520 --> 1:34:28.320
 You won't be able to change anything

1:34:28.320 --> 1:34:29.740
 about what happened there.

1:34:29.740 --> 1:34:31.240
 There's some long terms of service.

1:34:31.240 --> 1:34:34.560
 There's some other agreements around all this stuff.

1:34:34.560 --> 1:34:36.560
 At the end of the day,

1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:39.480
 that's the brand based and paper guarantee world

1:34:40.440 --> 1:34:42.240
 where it's all very vague and opaque

1:34:42.240 --> 1:34:44.080
 and you're kind of hoping for the best

1:34:44.080 --> 1:34:45.680
 because there's a nice logo.

1:34:45.680 --> 1:34:47.240
 It's been around a hundred years.

1:34:47.240 --> 1:34:48.320
 There's a lot of marble.

1:34:48.320 --> 1:34:49.320
 Put a lot of marble.

1:34:49.320 --> 1:34:50.800
 Big building, lots of marbles.

1:34:50.800 --> 1:34:53.760
 This is why banks have such nice buildings, right?

1:34:53.760 --> 1:34:56.040
 It's not because they want to spend money on buildings.

1:34:56.040 --> 1:35:00.000
 It's to create confidence in them as an entity

1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:03.200
 in order for people to transact through them, right?

1:35:03.200 --> 1:35:06.440
 This is why all these kind of go to cities

1:35:06.440 --> 1:35:08.760
 that had gold rushes, go to cities

1:35:08.760 --> 1:35:12.560
 that needed banking as a service in certain time periods,

1:35:12.560 --> 1:35:14.040
 they're the most beautiful buildings

1:35:14.040 --> 1:35:15.960
 at least in the United States.

1:35:15.960 --> 1:35:19.040
 So this is the brand based paper guarantee model

1:35:19.040 --> 1:35:20.480
 for which up until now,

1:35:20.480 --> 1:35:22.040
 there has never been an alternative, right?

1:35:22.040 --> 1:35:25.080
 So up until now, if you had a bad experience with a bank

1:35:25.080 --> 1:35:28.360
 or insurance company or some logo somewhere,

1:35:28.360 --> 1:35:30.360
 you would only have one option.

1:35:30.360 --> 1:35:32.360
 Your option would be to go across the road

1:35:32.360 --> 1:35:35.400
 and down the block to another building

1:35:35.400 --> 1:35:37.680
 with another color of marble

1:35:37.680 --> 1:35:39.320
 and another set of agreements

1:35:39.320 --> 1:35:43.120
 that are fundamentally still paper brand agreements, right?

1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:47.560
 Now for the first time, you have mathematical agreements.

1:35:47.560 --> 1:35:52.480
 You have mathematically guaranteed encryption secured,

1:35:52.480 --> 1:35:56.520
 decentralized infrastructure powered agreements, right?

1:35:56.520 --> 1:35:59.480
 This is really the shift.

1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:03.400
 This is really the comparison and the alternative

1:36:03.400 --> 1:36:05.560
 through which people should view all of this in my opinion,

1:36:05.560 --> 1:36:07.960
 because there's once again, this conception

1:36:07.960 --> 1:36:11.080
 that everything is fine, everything works very well.

1:36:11.080 --> 1:36:13.480
 Well, it does, it works fine and very well

1:36:13.480 --> 1:36:15.120
 as long as nothing goes wrong.

1:36:15.120 --> 1:36:17.520
 And then in the cases when things go wrong,

1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:20.360
 which they pretty much invariably at some point do,

1:36:20.360 --> 1:36:22.040
 then you find out that, well, you know,

1:36:22.040 --> 1:36:23.840
 turns out they don't have to pay me

1:36:23.840 --> 1:36:25.240
 or turns out I can't trade

1:36:25.240 --> 1:36:27.920
 or turns out the ATMs can be locked up

1:36:27.920 --> 1:36:30.120
 and only give me 66 euros per day,

1:36:30.120 --> 1:36:31.760
 whether I'm a business or an individual,

1:36:31.760 --> 1:36:35.080
 like what happened in Greece a few years ago, right?

1:36:35.080 --> 1:36:40.080
 And the reality is that once that becomes a strong enough

1:36:41.960 --> 1:36:43.840
 kind of realization for people,

1:36:43.840 --> 1:36:45.280
 I think they will all just migrate

1:36:45.280 --> 1:36:47.480
 to mathematically guaranteed contracts

1:36:47.480 --> 1:36:49.520
 because why wouldn't you?

1:36:49.520 --> 1:36:53.240
 So in the world of mathematically guaranteed contracts,

1:36:53.240 --> 1:36:56.240
 kind of how do we, and cryptographically secured

1:36:56.240 --> 1:36:57.960
 and decentralized infrastructure powered,

1:36:57.960 --> 1:37:00.200
 how do we evolve into that world?

1:37:01.400 --> 1:37:05.080
 Well, at the end of the day, it comes down to consensus,

1:37:05.080 --> 1:37:09.560
 right, it comes down to a collection of independent nodes,

1:37:09.560 --> 1:37:13.280
 a collection of provably independent computing systems

1:37:13.280 --> 1:37:17.120
 arriving at the same conclusion impartially.

1:37:17.120 --> 1:37:20.440
 That conclusion might be the transaction

1:37:20.440 --> 1:37:25.280
 is valid between address A and address B,

1:37:25.280 --> 1:37:26.720
 address A has one Bitcoin,

1:37:26.720 --> 1:37:27.920
 wants to send it to address B,

1:37:27.920 --> 1:37:29.960
 now address B has one Bitcoin, right?

1:37:29.960 --> 1:37:32.000
 So that's one degree of validation.

1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:33.880
 It has certain cryptographic primitives

1:37:33.880 --> 1:37:36.240
 that are used, certain levels of cryptography,

1:37:36.240 --> 1:37:37.760
 encryption, and other methods

1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:42.480
 that basically provide clarity and those guarantees.

1:37:42.480 --> 1:37:44.640
 But fundamentally, it's this level of consensus

1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:48.120
 that multiple independent computing systems

1:37:48.120 --> 1:37:51.280
 came to the same conclusion, verified that conclusion

1:37:51.280 --> 1:37:53.480
 and created a sense of finality,

1:37:53.480 --> 1:37:56.920
 created a final state that is globally considered

1:37:56.920 --> 1:37:59.520
 to be the state of a transaction.

1:38:00.920 --> 1:38:03.840
 And that is how it's achieved, right?

1:38:03.840 --> 1:38:06.720
 So it's achieved by users looking

1:38:06.720 --> 1:38:11.320
 at these mathematical contract systems and saying,

1:38:11.320 --> 1:38:13.720
 you know, if I have money in a bank,

1:38:13.720 --> 1:38:16.400
 there's one single person who controls that money,

1:38:16.400 --> 1:38:17.400
 that's the bank,

1:38:17.400 --> 1:38:18.680
 they could choose to give me my money

1:38:18.680 --> 1:38:20.880
 or choose not to give me my money.

1:38:20.880 --> 1:38:22.040
 And that's great,

1:38:22.040 --> 1:38:24.040
 but maybe there's a percentage of what I own

1:38:24.040 --> 1:38:26.240
 that I wanna put into another system

1:38:26.240 --> 1:38:29.160
 where there's thousands of independent computing systems

1:38:29.160 --> 1:38:31.160
 that are promising me, you know,

1:38:31.160 --> 1:38:33.200
 with the help of cryptographic primitives,

1:38:33.200 --> 1:38:36.600
 that I will be able to always have access to this,

1:38:36.600 --> 1:38:41.080
 whatever this is, whatever this token is,

1:38:41.080 --> 1:38:43.520
 I will at least, or at the very least,

1:38:43.520 --> 1:38:45.920
 I will always have unfettered,

1:38:45.920 --> 1:38:48.240
 complete control and access to it.

1:38:48.240 --> 1:38:50.400
 So, you know, that's one example.

1:38:50.400 --> 1:38:51.440
 Another example is, hey,

1:38:51.440 --> 1:38:52.960
 we have a hybrid smart contract

1:38:52.960 --> 1:38:55.160
 for something like crop insurance.

1:38:55.160 --> 1:38:59.200
 I, as the user, evaluate where this smart contract runs.

1:38:59.200 --> 1:39:01.520
 Oh, wow, the smart contract runs on Ethereum.

1:39:01.520 --> 1:39:03.560
 Great, thousands of nodes,

1:39:03.560 --> 1:39:06.760
 lots of computational security,

1:39:06.760 --> 1:39:08.560
 hash power, so on and so on.

1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:10.920
 Then I look at, oh, well, what triggers the contract?

1:39:10.920 --> 1:39:12.440
 Oh, there's this Oracle network.

1:39:12.440 --> 1:39:15.520
 Okay, it's composed of 25 nodes or 15 nodes,

1:39:15.520 --> 1:39:18.080
 gets data from five different weather stations.

1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:19.920
 You know, I'm comfortable with that.

1:39:19.920 --> 1:39:21.480
 I have a certain level of comfort

1:39:21.480 --> 1:39:23.200
 with that hybrid smart contract

1:39:23.200 --> 1:39:26.760
 and its ability to provide me consensus

1:39:26.760 --> 1:39:28.360
 about the transaction

1:39:28.360 --> 1:39:30.600
 once the contract knows what's happened,

1:39:30.600 --> 1:39:34.520
 and I'm comfortable with the consensus around the event

1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:36.240
 that controls the contract, right?

1:39:36.240 --> 1:39:37.560
 Because once again,

1:39:37.560 --> 1:39:39.880
 that event is what determines

1:39:39.880 --> 1:39:41.480
 what happens with the contract.

1:39:41.480 --> 1:39:43.960
 And if the contract is super well written,

1:39:43.960 --> 1:39:47.080
 it doesn't matter if the event isn't reliable, right?

1:39:47.080 --> 1:39:48.600
 So now I've made this determination.

1:39:48.600 --> 1:39:51.240
 I've gotten all this clear, transparent information

1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:55.640
 about this system that combines the contract code

1:39:55.640 --> 1:39:57.600
 with a decentralized Oracle network.

1:39:57.600 --> 1:39:59.600
 And I've made my decision to participate

1:39:59.600 --> 1:40:02.000
 in this decentralized insurance,

1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:03.840
 kind of crop insurance policy.

1:40:03.840 --> 1:40:06.560
 I've sent the Bitcoin or the stable coin

1:40:06.560 --> 1:40:09.200
 or whatever I have on my Android phone.

1:40:09.200 --> 1:40:12.400
 And then time goes by and let's say it doesn't rain,

1:40:12.400 --> 1:40:15.520
 lo and behold, the smart contract returns

1:40:15.520 --> 1:40:19.040
 the relevant amount from the policy back to me.

1:40:19.040 --> 1:40:22.160
 I continue my life as a farmer.

1:40:22.160 --> 1:40:25.080
 And by the way, the fact that that happened

1:40:25.080 --> 1:40:28.400
 contributes reputation and contributes proof

1:40:28.400 --> 1:40:30.400
 back to both the contract

1:40:30.400 --> 1:40:32.600
 as something that can prove to other people

1:40:32.600 --> 1:40:35.800
 that it has settled and the Oracle network

1:40:35.800 --> 1:40:36.920
 as something that can prove

1:40:36.920 --> 1:40:39.560
 that it has properly assessed reality

1:40:39.560 --> 1:40:41.760
 or properly triggered a contract.

1:40:41.760 --> 1:40:44.400
 And this is where there's one of many network effects

1:40:44.400 --> 1:40:47.720
 where the more that smart contracts

1:40:47.720 --> 1:40:49.360
 and Oracle networks are used,

1:40:49.360 --> 1:40:53.400
 they themselves generate this immutable on chain data

1:40:54.360 --> 1:40:57.920
 that proves their value and reliability.

1:40:57.920 --> 1:41:00.640
 And improving more and more of that

1:41:00.640 --> 1:41:03.800
 in more and more kind of use cases

1:41:03.800 --> 1:41:06.840
 and more and more variants of the same contract,

1:41:06.840 --> 1:41:09.840
 they arrive at a greater body of proof

1:41:09.840 --> 1:41:12.960
 that they like, I am the decentralized crop,

1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:16.720
 the decentralized insurance contract for crop insurance

1:41:16.720 --> 1:41:19.880
 used by a million users.

1:41:19.880 --> 1:41:24.560
 And my failure rate is non existent or really low.

1:41:24.560 --> 1:41:25.720
 And here's my Oracle network.

1:41:25.720 --> 1:41:28.840
 And by the way, it's also settled a million of these.

1:41:28.840 --> 1:41:31.480
 And so it's not the logo, right?

1:41:31.480 --> 1:41:35.560
 It's not, hey, what a nice logo you have

1:41:35.560 --> 1:41:40.120
 on top of a building above a train terminal or something.

1:41:40.120 --> 1:41:44.040
 It's much more, hey, there's a million people,

1:41:44.040 --> 1:41:45.480
 there's a million separate contracts

1:41:45.480 --> 1:41:46.680
 that got settled correctly.

1:41:46.680 --> 1:41:50.360
 I have all the proof that I could ever need about that.

1:41:50.360 --> 1:41:53.440
 And it's not something that's very easy to gain, right?

1:41:53.440 --> 1:41:57.080
 Because real value was at stake, real value was moved around.

1:41:57.080 --> 1:41:59.160
 And so I think once again,

1:41:59.160 --> 1:42:02.560
 the transparency aspect comes in where you're able to prove

1:42:02.560 --> 1:42:07.560
 that the cryptographically enforced contracts are better.

1:42:09.440 --> 1:42:12.040
 That said, you can still integrate the traditional banks

1:42:12.040 --> 1:42:13.520
 as long as you create a data feed

1:42:13.520 --> 1:42:16.960
 on the amount of marble that's included.

1:42:16.960 --> 1:42:19.280
 So if that's valuable to you in terms of reputation,

1:42:19.280 --> 1:42:22.360
 you could still integrate the marble, the amount of marble

1:42:22.360 --> 1:42:26.000
 that and the size of the logo.

1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:28.600
 We could still keep the banks around.

1:42:28.600 --> 1:42:29.440
 I think we will.

1:42:29.440 --> 1:42:30.800
 I think what'll happen with the banks

1:42:30.800 --> 1:42:32.480
 and all the insurance companies, by the way,

1:42:32.480 --> 1:42:34.840
 is not that they'll all just die or something.

1:42:34.840 --> 1:42:36.400
 I think it'll be just like the internet.

1:42:36.400 --> 1:42:38.640
 There'll be some of them that adopt this

1:42:38.640 --> 1:42:40.120
 and some of them that don't,

1:42:40.120 --> 1:42:41.320
 and some of them that do it faster,

1:42:41.320 --> 1:42:42.840
 some of them that do it slower.

1:42:42.840 --> 1:42:45.400
 And that's an economic decision that they'll make.

1:42:45.400 --> 1:42:46.960
 I think their whole question is,

1:42:46.960 --> 1:42:48.920
 is this a foregone conclusion?

1:42:48.920 --> 1:42:51.120
 I mean, I think my answer is yes,

1:42:51.120 --> 1:42:52.960
 this is definitely gonna be happening.

1:42:52.960 --> 1:42:55.080
 I think they still have a question of,

1:42:55.080 --> 1:42:58.560
 is this gonna change my industry?

1:42:58.560 --> 1:43:03.480
 But I'm seeing a definite shift in people's understanding.

1:43:03.480 --> 1:43:06.080
 And I think that shift is gonna accelerate rapidly

1:43:06.080 --> 1:43:08.560
 as one or two of them of their competitors

1:43:08.560 --> 1:43:11.800
 throw their hat in the smart contract ring

1:43:11.800 --> 1:43:14.560
 and say, well, I have smart contracts.

1:43:14.560 --> 1:43:17.320
 I guarantee my outcomes to you.

1:43:17.320 --> 1:43:18.480
 What do they do for you?

1:43:19.560 --> 1:43:22.040
 It's risky, just use mine.

1:43:22.040 --> 1:43:24.280
 And the second some of them start losing business

1:43:24.280 --> 1:43:27.720
 because of that, they're gonna move very quickly

1:43:27.720 --> 1:43:30.080
 because that's what all of their compensation structures

1:43:30.080 --> 1:43:32.960
 and all their goal planning structures are based around.

1:43:32.960 --> 1:43:35.240
 They're based around what is losing us business

1:43:35.240 --> 1:43:36.800
 or getting us business.

1:43:36.800 --> 1:43:38.960
 Yeah, it's fascinating organizationally though,

1:43:38.960 --> 1:43:41.920
 to think about banks, they're very old school

1:43:41.920 --> 1:43:46.280
 and their ability to move quickly is questionable to me.

1:43:46.280 --> 1:43:50.120
 I just look at basic online banking,

1:43:50.120 --> 1:43:53.240
 like how good banks are creating

1:43:53.240 --> 1:43:55.840
 a frictionless online experience.

1:43:55.840 --> 1:43:58.640
 And I think they're not very good.

1:43:58.640 --> 1:44:01.160
 And so that speaks to the kind of people

1:44:01.160 --> 1:44:03.880
 who are in leadership positions at banks,

1:44:03.880 --> 1:44:05.680
 the kind of people they hire,

1:44:05.680 --> 1:44:07.520
 the kind of culture there is.

1:44:07.520 --> 1:44:12.280
 So I do wonder if banks will from inside

1:44:12.280 --> 1:44:15.440
 revolutionize themselves to include smart contracts

1:44:15.440 --> 1:44:18.800
 or whether totally new competitors will have to emerge

1:44:18.800 --> 1:44:22.320
 that basically create new kinds of banks.

1:44:22.320 --> 1:44:26.200
 Whether, what is the company square?

1:44:26.200 --> 1:44:30.360
 I think it comes up out of nowhere really with Cash App

1:44:30.360 --> 1:44:31.840
 and they have Bitcoin on Cash App,

1:44:31.840 --> 1:44:34.440
 whether they will start incorporating smart contracts

1:44:34.440 --> 1:44:39.440
 and they will revolutionize the whole banking industry

1:44:40.120 --> 1:44:44.640
 or whether Bank of America will revolutionize themselves

1:44:44.640 --> 1:44:46.000
 from within.

1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:50.040
 I'm skeptical on Bank of America, but you never know.

1:44:50.040 --> 1:44:53.640
 In general, I'm fascinated by how big organizations,

1:44:53.640 --> 1:44:56.760
 whether it's Google or Microsoft or Bank of America,

1:44:56.760 --> 1:45:00.720
 pivot hard in a world that's quickly changing.

1:45:00.720 --> 1:45:05.480
 I think that takes bold leadership and a lot of firing

1:45:05.480 --> 1:45:08.120
 and a lot of pain and a lot of meetings

1:45:08.120 --> 1:45:10.680
 where the one asshole brings up the

1:45:10.680 --> 1:45:13.440
 from first principles idea that, you know what,

1:45:13.440 --> 1:45:16.840
 the ways we've been doing stuff in the past require,

1:45:16.840 --> 1:45:20.440
 we need to throw that out and do stuff totally differently.

1:45:20.440 --> 1:45:22.440
 I know a lot of those assholes

1:45:22.440 --> 1:45:25.320
 in a lot of these different industries.

1:45:25.320 --> 1:45:27.040
 First of all, I think they're getting listened to more

1:45:27.040 --> 1:45:30.480
 and second of all, I think all of these places,

1:45:30.480 --> 1:45:32.400
 as I look at it more and more,

1:45:32.400 --> 1:45:35.440
 I think they have a fundamental line of business

1:45:35.440 --> 1:45:37.080
 that they try to protect

1:45:37.080 --> 1:45:39.000
 and then everybody's compensation

1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:40.400
 and everybody's metrics and goals

1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:43.080
 is focused around that line of business.

1:45:43.080 --> 1:45:48.080
 So the second that things begin to impact that,

1:45:48.640 --> 1:45:52.520
 then everybody will be in a senior meeting

1:45:52.520 --> 1:45:55.200
 and that asshole will be quite listened to

1:45:55.200 --> 1:45:57.960
 because he will have the only thoughtful explanation

1:45:57.960 --> 1:45:59.920
 as to why this is happening.

1:45:59.920 --> 1:46:02.960
 How things will evolve from there, I actually don't know

1:46:02.960 --> 1:46:05.760
 because that hasn't been the case yet.

1:46:05.760 --> 1:46:08.720
 But my thinking is that there will be people

1:46:08.720 --> 1:46:12.040
 who don't wanna cannibalize certain parts of their business

1:46:12.040 --> 1:46:15.000
 or don't wanna change certain parts of their business

1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:16.480
 and then there will be people who say,

1:46:16.480 --> 1:46:18.960
 look, I think this is how the world's gonna work.

1:46:18.960 --> 1:46:20.680
 We're gonna make a very, very heavy

1:46:23.040 --> 1:46:27.320
 kind of set of commitments to put resources towards this.

1:46:27.320 --> 1:46:29.880
 I already see that with a few banks

1:46:29.880 --> 1:46:33.160
 working on various blockchain based systems,

1:46:33.160 --> 1:46:34.880
 but granted, they've been working on those for years.

1:46:34.880 --> 1:46:37.440
 So I think all of this comes down

1:46:37.440 --> 1:46:39.880
 to these kind of quarterly earnings calls

1:46:39.880 --> 1:46:44.040
 where somebody asks them, hey, I saw that bank over there

1:46:44.040 --> 1:46:45.440
 once the blockchain bond

1:46:45.440 --> 1:46:47.880
 or a smart contract derivative platform.

1:46:47.880 --> 1:46:51.600
 And I also saw that they made $10 billion in revenues

1:46:51.600 --> 1:46:55.040
 or $10 billion in volume or whatever it is from that.

1:46:55.040 --> 1:46:58.080
 What's your plan on the earnings call?

1:46:58.080 --> 1:47:00.560
 And I promise you by the next earnings call,

1:47:00.560 --> 1:47:02.040
 there's a plan.

1:47:02.040 --> 1:47:03.440
 And then the question on the next one is,

1:47:03.440 --> 1:47:04.720
 well, when's the plan gonna happen?

1:47:04.720 --> 1:47:06.000
 And then by the next earnings call,

1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:08.440
 it's a plan is happening.

1:47:08.440 --> 1:47:11.560
 And that's what these people are sensitive to.

1:47:11.560 --> 1:47:13.760
 That's what these organizations are structured around.

1:47:13.760 --> 1:47:17.200
 It's not completely economically like disconnected, right?

1:47:17.200 --> 1:47:20.440
 They have this core business, they wanna protect it.

1:47:20.440 --> 1:47:23.000
 I understand that idea,

1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:26.040
 but I think that the problem with that

1:47:26.040 --> 1:47:31.040
 is sometimes it requires this myopic focus, right?

1:47:31.840 --> 1:47:34.520
 And that's what all the innovation stuff is about.

1:47:34.520 --> 1:47:36.600
 Every time somebody at a corporate entity

1:47:36.600 --> 1:47:40.280
 is about innovation, they're trying to sidestep this.

1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:42.320
 But once again, the incentives to maintain

1:47:42.320 --> 1:47:45.240
 whatever the core businesses is so strong

1:47:45.240 --> 1:47:49.200
 that the innovation people, even though they are there,

1:47:52.040 --> 1:47:53.840
 I think they get a phone call and go like,

1:47:53.840 --> 1:47:55.560
 what are we doing for this?

1:47:55.560 --> 1:47:58.560
 And the ones that actually did good work

1:47:58.560 --> 1:48:00.600
 and got ready to do something for this

1:48:00.600 --> 1:48:03.960
 have done their employer and their organization

1:48:03.960 --> 1:48:05.800
 a very positive service.

1:48:05.800 --> 1:48:07.800
 Whereas the ones that aren't ready,

1:48:07.800 --> 1:48:09.920
 I mean, they'll make up something

1:48:09.920 --> 1:48:11.920
 and maybe they're really smart and they'll get it together.

1:48:11.920 --> 1:48:12.880
 I don't know.

1:48:12.880 --> 1:48:15.200
 Can we talk about tokens a little bit?

1:48:15.200 --> 1:48:19.600
 Generally speaking, there's been a meteoric rise

1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:20.920
 of a bunch of different tokens.

1:48:20.920 --> 1:48:24.240
 We could just talk about Bitcoin and Ethereum as examples.

1:48:24.240 --> 1:48:27.960
 Bitcoin I think crossed $60,000 in value.

1:48:27.960 --> 1:48:31.080
 What are your thoughts in general on this rise?

1:48:31.080 --> 1:48:32.480
 What's the future of Bitcoin?

1:48:32.480 --> 1:48:34.040
 What's the future of Ethereum?

1:48:34.040 --> 1:48:38.880
 There's the total value locked metric

1:48:38.880 --> 1:48:42.000
 that I think generalizes the different kind of value

1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:45.280
 of these tokens.

1:48:46.800 --> 1:48:51.000
 What does the future value and impact

1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:52.360
 of cryptocurrency look like

1:48:52.360 --> 1:48:54.920
 if we look through the lens of these tokens?

1:48:56.040 --> 1:48:58.400
 I think valuing all these tokens

1:48:58.400 --> 1:48:59.920
 and determining that isn't something

1:48:59.920 --> 1:49:01.280
 I'm particularly great at.

1:49:01.280 --> 1:49:02.960
 I haven't spent a lot of time on that.

1:49:02.960 --> 1:49:05.240
 I've spent the vast majority of my time

1:49:05.240 --> 1:49:07.800
 on building these systems and architecting them

1:49:07.800 --> 1:49:09.960
 and getting them to fruition and getting them to a place

1:49:09.960 --> 1:49:12.400
 where they operate properly on both the technical

1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:15.560
 and the crypto economic and in every other sense.

1:49:15.560 --> 1:49:17.160
 I think with Bitcoin,

1:49:17.160 --> 1:49:21.640
 there is a certain conception

1:49:21.640 --> 1:49:24.440
 of non governmental fiat money

1:49:24.440 --> 1:49:28.840
 that Bitcoin is really the first creator of, right?

1:49:28.840 --> 1:49:31.960
 So there's this very powerful idea called fiat money.

1:49:31.960 --> 1:49:36.920
 It's basically more or less a kind of 40 year experiment.

1:49:36.920 --> 1:49:38.480
 I think on August 15th of this year

1:49:38.480 --> 1:49:41.320
 is maybe I think given the 40th anniversary,

1:49:41.320 --> 1:49:42.960
 government can say, hey, I have a currency

1:49:42.960 --> 1:49:46.160
 and it's worth something and here it is.

1:49:46.160 --> 1:49:50.800
 In terms of the way that governments have stopped that

1:49:50.800 --> 1:49:52.480
 in the past is if anyone tries to make

1:49:52.480 --> 1:49:54.440
 another fiat currency in their country,

1:49:54.440 --> 1:49:56.440
 they immediately shut it down, right?

1:49:56.440 --> 1:49:58.920
 They immediately say, hey, this is really bad.

1:49:58.920 --> 1:50:00.440
 You've done something really bad.

1:50:00.440 --> 1:50:01.640
 It's time for you to stop.

1:50:01.640 --> 1:50:03.000
 Don't do it anymore.

1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:04.200
 And it stops, right?

1:50:04.200 --> 1:50:07.800
 That's been the history of non governmental fiat currency.

1:50:07.800 --> 1:50:12.160
 Bitcoin is really due to its decentralized nature,

1:50:12.160 --> 1:50:15.240
 the first and possibly in some cases,

1:50:15.240 --> 1:50:16.120
 in many people's minds,

1:50:16.120 --> 1:50:19.720
 it's still the only true non governmental fiat currency.

1:50:20.760 --> 1:50:24.400
 Now, how powerful is non governmental fiat currency?

1:50:24.400 --> 1:50:26.360
 I have no idea, right?

1:50:26.360 --> 1:50:31.360
 This is why so it's really as powerful as the ideas

1:50:31.360 --> 1:50:33.440
 that people ascribe to it are, right?

1:50:33.440 --> 1:50:36.720
 So let's say people start saying,

1:50:36.720 --> 1:50:37.960
 like right now people are saying,

1:50:37.960 --> 1:50:39.240
 hey, it's internet money.

1:50:39.240 --> 1:50:41.600
 It's the money of the internet.

1:50:41.600 --> 1:50:42.600
 Okay, great.

1:50:42.600 --> 1:50:43.440
 What's that worth?

1:50:43.440 --> 1:50:44.280
 I don't know.

1:50:44.280 --> 1:50:45.120
 It's probably worth a lot.

1:50:45.120 --> 1:50:45.960
 I have no idea what it's worth,

1:50:45.960 --> 1:50:50.960
 but as an idea, as a concept to underpin the fiat money,

1:50:51.120 --> 1:50:56.120
 the let there be aspect of fiat and of Bitcoin,

1:50:56.800 --> 1:50:58.400
 you basically look at it and you say,

1:50:58.400 --> 1:51:00.040
 yeah, internet money.

1:51:00.040 --> 1:51:02.400
 Okay, that could be worth whatever,

1:51:02.400 --> 1:51:06.040
 60,000, 600,000, great question, right?

1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:08.600
 There are other versions of the world, right?

1:51:08.600 --> 1:51:09.720
 Where people say,

1:51:12.080 --> 1:51:14.520
 there are countries that don't have a good fiat currency

1:51:14.520 --> 1:51:16.920
 and I see a lot of people using Bitcoin.

1:51:16.920 --> 1:51:19.400
 So Bitcoin isn't internet money,

1:51:19.400 --> 1:51:24.120
 it's countries without a good currency money.

1:51:24.120 --> 1:51:25.800
 So all the countries without a good currency

1:51:25.800 --> 1:51:29.200
 now use Bitcoin and let there be,

1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:31.880
 Bitcoin as this, right?

1:51:31.880 --> 1:51:33.160
 As this conception of Bitcoin.

1:51:33.160 --> 1:51:34.640
 What's the value of that?

1:51:34.640 --> 1:51:35.480
 I don't know.

1:51:35.480 --> 1:51:36.320
 That's a great question.

1:51:36.320 --> 1:51:37.720
 Probably huge amount of value.

1:51:39.040 --> 1:51:42.680
 Then there's a further conception of Bitcoin

1:51:42.680 --> 1:51:45.000
 as some digital gold.

1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:46.600
 There's a scarcity dynamic.

1:51:46.600 --> 1:51:49.480
 There's all these other kinds of dynamics.

1:51:49.480 --> 1:51:52.600
 What is a portable version of digital gold

1:51:52.600 --> 1:51:57.600
 with some kind of built in scarcity worth?

1:51:57.600 --> 1:52:01.040
 You know, kind of artificially created scarcity.

1:52:01.040 --> 1:52:01.880
 What's that worth?

1:52:02.960 --> 1:52:04.200
 I don't know.

1:52:04.200 --> 1:52:05.760
 That's a great question.

1:52:05.760 --> 1:52:07.920
 I haven't done the analysis on that is the point,

1:52:07.920 --> 1:52:09.400
 might be worth a lot.

1:52:09.400 --> 1:52:13.280
 What is it all worth if all three of these things,

1:52:13.280 --> 1:52:16.200
 you know, flow into the same fiat,

1:52:16.200 --> 1:52:18.000
 kind of let there be Bitcoin

1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:20.680
 as these three things conception of Bitcoin?

1:52:21.840 --> 1:52:22.680
 I don't know what that's worth.

1:52:22.680 --> 1:52:23.520
 I also don't know what that's worth,

1:52:23.520 --> 1:52:25.840
 but could be worth a huge amount.

1:52:25.840 --> 1:52:28.080
 So I think it's not,

1:52:28.080 --> 1:52:28.920
 I don't think it's,

1:52:28.920 --> 1:52:30.200
 I personally don't think it's super important

1:52:30.200 --> 1:52:31.360
 what I think it's worth

1:52:31.360 --> 1:52:33.520
 or what many other people think it's worth.

1:52:33.520 --> 1:52:35.560
 I don't think that's really that important.

1:52:35.560 --> 1:52:37.240
 I think what's probably important

1:52:37.240 --> 1:52:42.240
 is understanding what the societal conception of Bitcoin is

1:52:44.760 --> 1:52:48.440
 and how does that societal conception evolve over time.

1:52:49.640 --> 1:52:51.200
 And that interestingly enough,

1:52:51.200 --> 1:52:54.280
 doesn't just depend on, you know,

1:52:54.280 --> 1:52:58.120
 you or me or the people who made Bitcoin or anything else.

1:52:58.120 --> 1:53:00.720
 It actually depends on current events.

1:53:00.720 --> 1:53:02.720
 So for example, if people suddenly say,

1:53:02.720 --> 1:53:05.960
 I'm more and more worried about fiat currency.

1:53:05.960 --> 1:53:09.400
 I'm more and more worried that governmental fiat,

1:53:09.400 --> 1:53:12.520
 even if it's the most reliable version of that

1:53:12.520 --> 1:53:14.560
 is not as good as I thought it was.

1:53:14.560 --> 1:53:17.800
 Maybe I should go on the PayPal app

1:53:17.800 --> 1:53:20.440
 and maybe I should get some Bitcoin just in case.

1:53:20.440 --> 1:53:25.440
 What's the world where Bitcoin is a certain percentage

1:53:25.800 --> 1:53:28.080
 of everyone's ownership as a hedge

1:53:28.080 --> 1:53:32.800
 against governmental fiat money not being so good?

1:53:32.800 --> 1:53:35.200
 Haven't done the analysis, but another example, right?

1:53:35.200 --> 1:53:38.320
 Here's this conception, that's the conception.

1:53:38.320 --> 1:53:40.040
 So when I look at Bitcoin,

1:53:40.040 --> 1:53:43.680
 what I see is a lot of these fascinating conceptions

1:53:43.680 --> 1:53:47.680
 of what the fiat, let there be value of Bitcoin is.

1:53:47.680 --> 1:53:50.760
 By the way, all of them could be true.

1:53:50.760 --> 1:53:51.880
 Maybe some of them are true.

1:53:51.880 --> 1:53:53.400
 Maybe some of them aren't true.

1:53:53.400 --> 1:53:54.920
 And the fascinating thing is that

1:53:54.920 --> 1:53:56.920
 I've seen this conception change, right?

1:53:56.920 --> 1:53:59.040
 So when I started in the Bitcoin space,

1:53:59.040 --> 1:54:01.960
 the conception was micropayments.

1:54:01.960 --> 1:54:05.400
 The cost of Bitcoin is low, we'll have micropayments.

1:54:05.400 --> 1:54:09.080
 Micropayments are wonderful for machine to machine

1:54:09.080 --> 1:54:10.800
 transactions, micropayments are wonderful.

1:54:10.800 --> 1:54:13.400
 The emerging market, and that's fine, right?

1:54:13.400 --> 1:54:15.760
 And that was one conception of Bitcoin

1:54:15.760 --> 1:54:19.600
 as let there be Bitcoin as micropayments platform, right?

1:54:19.600 --> 1:54:21.880
 But then the value rose and things changed.

1:54:21.880 --> 1:54:24.000
 There wasn't enough expansion in certain ways.

1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:26.600
 And now the conception has evolved

1:54:26.600 --> 1:54:28.520
 into this other conception.

1:54:28.520 --> 1:54:30.760
 But at the end of the day,

1:54:30.760 --> 1:54:34.640
 I think governments have a very clear set of steps

1:54:34.640 --> 1:54:39.640
 for directing the public's conception of their fiat, right?

1:54:40.320 --> 1:54:44.240
 They say our fiat is worth this for these reasons.

1:54:44.240 --> 1:54:45.640
 Bitcoin doesn't have that.

1:54:45.640 --> 1:54:49.240
 Bitcoin doesn't have an official Bitcoin spokesperson

1:54:49.240 --> 1:54:50.760
 that goes out and says,

1:54:50.760 --> 1:54:53.200
 the non governmental money called Bitcoin,

1:54:53.200 --> 1:54:55.360
 the non governmental fiat money called Bitcoin

1:54:55.360 --> 1:54:57.960
 has value on the basis of this, this, this and this.

1:54:57.960 --> 1:55:00.720
 Here's our fiscal budget, here's our future plans.

1:55:00.720 --> 1:55:04.080
 Our money will continue to be safe and secure and reliable.

1:55:04.080 --> 1:55:07.360
 And so what that hole creates

1:55:07.360 --> 1:55:09.120
 is a hole that we all fill, right?

1:55:09.120 --> 1:55:12.360
 We all basically come to some vague kind of

1:55:12.360 --> 1:55:16.680
 group understanding that Bitcoin is worth this

1:55:16.680 --> 1:55:20.880
 because it is tied to,

1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:27.480
 let's say all non governmental fiat money comes

1:55:27.480 --> 1:55:30.360
 into question, everybody doubts it,

1:55:30.360 --> 1:55:32.240
 possibly due to inflation.

1:55:32.240 --> 1:55:35.480
 And everybody says, you know, this is nice,

1:55:35.480 --> 1:55:39.440
 but I'd like to keep 10, 20% of my wealth

1:55:39.440 --> 1:55:42.920
 in non governmental fiat, just in case,

1:55:44.360 --> 1:55:46.280
 you know, what are those numbers?

1:55:47.320 --> 1:55:49.280
 I mean, if that happens, you know,

1:55:49.280 --> 1:55:51.160
 I'm guessing you can add a few zeros.

1:55:52.600 --> 1:55:55.040
 I like how you say I haven't done the analysis

1:55:55.040 --> 1:55:56.920
 as if I'm sure a lot of people have done

1:55:56.920 --> 1:55:59.360
 quote unquote analysis, but it's not,

1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:00.520
 it's still speculation.

1:56:00.520 --> 1:56:02.080
 Nobody can predict the future,

1:56:02.080 --> 1:56:04.800
 especially when so much of it has to do

1:56:04.800 --> 1:56:08.600
 with a large number of people holding an idea

1:56:08.600 --> 1:56:10.720
 in their mind as to the importance

1:56:10.720 --> 1:56:13.360
 of a particular technology like Bitcoin.

1:56:13.360 --> 1:56:15.400
 There's a lot of excitement by its possibilities,

1:56:15.400 --> 1:56:19.480
 but the number of zeros you add is an open question

1:56:19.480 --> 1:56:22.040
 and nobody can do a perfect analysis

1:56:22.040 --> 1:56:24.440
 except whoever created this simulation.

1:56:27.160 --> 1:56:28.680
 Let me ask you this question.

1:56:30.360 --> 1:56:33.160
 Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?

1:56:33.160 --> 1:56:38.160
 There's quite a few people who suggest that person is you.

1:56:39.560 --> 1:56:42.680
 So is it you?

1:56:42.680 --> 1:56:43.520
 No.

1:56:45.200 --> 1:56:46.600
 Who do you think it could be?

1:56:47.760 --> 1:56:48.640
 I don't know who it is.

1:56:48.640 --> 1:56:52.080
 I think if I had to guess, it's probably a group of people,

1:56:52.080 --> 1:56:55.240
 some of which might not even be around anymore.

1:56:55.240 --> 1:56:57.400
 You know, obviously I'm very grateful to,

1:56:57.400 --> 1:56:59.200
 if this is a singular or a group of people

1:56:59.200 --> 1:57:00.680
 for kicking off this entire industry

1:57:00.680 --> 1:57:02.800
 and making this amazing change in the world

1:57:02.800 --> 1:57:05.480
 that I have the privilege and luxury

1:57:05.480 --> 1:57:08.480
 of being part of in some small way in the work that I do.

1:57:09.920 --> 1:57:13.440
 I think also this kind of focus on who is Satoshi

1:57:13.440 --> 1:57:14.920
 or who isn't Satoshi,

1:57:14.920 --> 1:57:17.640
 shouldn't in my opinion matter so much

1:57:17.640 --> 1:57:20.040
 because regardless of who it is,

1:57:20.040 --> 1:57:24.080
 that in my opinion should have no substantial

1:57:24.080 --> 1:57:27.760
 significant effect or bearing on the functioning

1:57:27.760 --> 1:57:29.560
 or the value or the use

1:57:29.560 --> 1:57:33.480
 or the security of the Bitcoin system, right?

1:57:33.480 --> 1:57:35.840
 So I think whoever it is,

1:57:35.840 --> 1:57:38.880
 they're probably better off not making that public.

1:57:38.880 --> 1:57:40.240
 And I think beyond that,

1:57:41.560 --> 1:57:43.760
 whoever it turned out to be shouldn't matter

1:57:43.760 --> 1:57:46.360
 because it has nothing to do

1:57:46.360 --> 1:57:48.640
 with how the system is made useful

1:57:48.640 --> 1:57:50.760
 or secure or anything else.

1:57:50.760 --> 1:57:54.480
 And so I think that's the point of view that I have.

1:57:54.480 --> 1:57:58.160
 Now, if you were Satoshi Nakamoto, would you tell me?

1:57:58.160 --> 1:58:02.160
 Because you said they shouldn't,

1:58:02.160 --> 1:58:05.440
 whoever Satoshi is, you should keep that private.

1:58:05.440 --> 1:58:08.320
 So would you tell it to me or no?

1:58:08.320 --> 1:58:12.040
 We're in some kind of weird like thought experiment here.

1:58:12.040 --> 1:58:16.960
 If I was this guy, let me think about this,

1:58:16.960 --> 1:58:19.200
 which I'm not, by the way, I am not this person.

1:58:19.200 --> 1:58:21.560
 But if you were, would you say it?

1:58:21.560 --> 1:58:26.560
 I think probably not.

1:58:29.360 --> 1:58:30.200
 I don't see the,

1:58:30.200 --> 1:58:33.000
 I think that they would cause a lot of distraction

1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:34.920
 and a lot of weird stuff.

1:58:34.920 --> 1:58:38.880
 And so realistically, I don't think it would help anybody

1:58:38.880 --> 1:58:40.800
 or even the person who discloses it,

1:58:40.800 --> 1:58:42.480
 but just to be clear, I am not.

1:58:42.480 --> 1:58:45.000
 And whoever it is, I think they haven't said anything

1:58:45.000 --> 1:58:46.520
 because they don't want the attention

1:58:46.520 --> 1:58:47.920
 and they don't want the distraction

1:58:47.920 --> 1:58:49.800
 and they don't want all the problems from this.

1:58:49.800 --> 1:58:53.040
 And that makes sense to me, conceptually.

1:58:53.040 --> 1:58:55.160
 It's fascinating to think if they're still out there

1:58:55.160 --> 1:58:58.760
 and part of the Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency community,

1:59:00.600 --> 1:59:04.920
 and it is inspiring to think that if they're out there,

1:59:04.920 --> 1:59:09.080
 that they're not revealing their identity

1:59:09.080 --> 1:59:11.360
 because it would be a distraction.

1:59:11.360 --> 1:59:13.040
 That's kind of inspiring that people are like that.

1:59:13.040 --> 1:59:15.400
 Just like George Washington,

1:59:15.400 --> 1:59:17.960
 a relinquishing power is inspiring

1:59:17.960 --> 1:59:20.560
 because it's ultimately about the progress of the community

1:59:20.560 --> 1:59:24.000
 and not some kind of ego driven attention scheme.

1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:26.360
 Again, very inspiring.

1:59:26.360 --> 1:59:29.720
 The humans at their best are inspiring.

1:59:29.720 --> 1:59:31.680
 What do you think about the certainty

1:59:31.680 --> 1:59:34.720
 that people in the Bitcoin Maximus community

1:59:34.720 --> 1:59:37.680
 have about this particular piece of technology, Bitcoin?

1:59:38.640 --> 1:59:41.520
 Is there something interesting that you think

1:59:41.520 --> 1:59:44.360
 that you might wanna say about this community

1:59:44.360 --> 1:59:48.720
 or is it just is what it is?

1:59:48.720 --> 1:59:49.760
 I think at the end of the day,

1:59:49.760 --> 1:59:51.720
 results speak for themselves

1:59:51.720 --> 1:59:55.880
 and Bitcoin has had an amazing impact on our industry

1:59:55.880 --> 1:59:59.000
 and has had an amazing impact on the world.

1:59:59.000 --> 2:00:01.120
 And I think the result is still

2:00:01.120 --> 2:00:03.440
 that Bitcoin is very widely adopted

2:00:03.440 --> 2:00:07.240
 and driving the adoption of our industry in many ways.

2:00:07.240 --> 2:00:08.920
 So I think it's very difficult for people to say

2:00:08.920 --> 2:00:12.800
 that Bitcoin maximalists don't have something

2:00:12.800 --> 2:00:14.040
 that they can latch onto and say,

2:00:14.040 --> 2:00:16.280
 hey, there's something very real here.

2:00:16.280 --> 2:00:18.400
 I think there's been decisions made

2:00:18.400 --> 2:00:19.920
 by the Bitcoin community

2:00:19.920 --> 2:00:21.800
 and the people who made the Bitcoin protocol

2:00:21.800 --> 2:00:24.360
 to focus it on Bitcoin

2:00:24.360 --> 2:00:28.120
 and to focus it on the kind of storing

2:00:28.120 --> 2:00:29.680
 of the ledger of Bitcoin

2:00:29.680 --> 2:00:31.200
 and the information about Bitcoin

2:00:31.200 --> 2:00:32.440
 and the transaction of Bitcoin

2:00:32.440 --> 2:00:34.800
 and to focus on securing that.

2:00:34.800 --> 2:00:37.480
 And I understand why that decision was made

2:00:37.480 --> 2:00:38.480
 to a certain degree, right?

2:00:38.480 --> 2:00:39.880
 It was about focus.

2:00:39.880 --> 2:00:43.000
 It was about getting something worthwhile right

2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:46.680
 without adding additional features and additional risk.

2:00:46.680 --> 2:00:49.880
 And that decision is a decision that was made

2:00:49.880 --> 2:00:53.680
 and has kind of the benefits of focus

2:00:53.680 --> 2:00:57.360
 and the benefits of a certain amount of security

2:00:57.360 --> 2:01:01.040
 and a certain amount of guarantees around Bitcoin

2:01:01.040 --> 2:01:04.280
 and what that is and the value of that.

2:01:04.280 --> 2:01:07.680
 And then it has certain limitations

2:01:07.680 --> 2:01:10.760
 as a consequence of doing less

2:01:10.760 --> 2:01:12.360
 or having the system hold data

2:01:12.360 --> 2:01:13.600
 that isn't related to Bitcoin

2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:17.800
 or not having the system hold contractual outcomes

2:01:17.800 --> 2:01:19.840
 or smart contract code.

2:01:19.840 --> 2:01:21.960
 So I think it's just kind of a decision, right?

2:01:21.960 --> 2:01:24.600
 And I understand why they're excited

2:01:24.600 --> 2:01:25.480
 and I'm very excited.

2:01:25.480 --> 2:01:28.240
 I started in this industry going to Bitcoin meetups

2:01:28.240 --> 2:01:30.200
 and I met a lot of fantastic people,

2:01:30.200 --> 2:01:32.800
 libertarian people that wanted

2:01:32.800 --> 2:01:34.400
 to see the world work differently

2:01:34.400 --> 2:01:35.720
 and shared a lot of my beliefs

2:01:35.720 --> 2:01:37.560
 and a lot of my points of view.

2:01:37.560 --> 2:01:40.000
 And so anyone who's been in the industry

2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:44.120
 as long as I have has had to come

2:01:44.120 --> 2:01:45.280
 from the Bitcoin ecosystem

2:01:45.280 --> 2:01:48.200
 by virtue of kind of starting out that early.

2:01:48.200 --> 2:01:50.640
 So I have an unbelievable amount of respect

2:01:50.640 --> 2:01:55.000
 and admiration and gratitude for Bitcoin

2:01:55.000 --> 2:01:56.560
 and that it exists and everything that it's done

2:01:56.560 --> 2:01:58.080
 and that it birthed this industry.

2:01:58.080 --> 2:01:59.960
 There's absolutely no doubt about that.

2:02:01.040 --> 2:02:04.440
 At the same time, whatever design decisions people make

2:02:04.440 --> 2:02:07.000
 are the design decisions they make, right?

2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:08.960
 And so if you've made a design decision

2:02:08.960 --> 2:02:11.880
 that this ledger and this thing will be about Bitcoin,

2:02:11.880 --> 2:02:13.880
 it won't be about colored coins,

2:02:13.880 --> 2:02:16.480
 it won't be about op return at 80 bytes,

2:02:16.480 --> 2:02:20.480
 it won't be about these other kind of nuances

2:02:20.480 --> 2:02:23.680
 that you don't want this to be about, then that's fine.

2:02:23.680 --> 2:02:26.720
 That's fine and that's a logical decision

2:02:26.720 --> 2:02:28.120
 and it's called focus.

2:02:28.120 --> 2:02:30.120
 And focus has a lot of value

2:02:30.120 --> 2:02:32.680
 and a lot of great technology products

2:02:32.680 --> 2:02:36.520
 have focused on something and done that.

2:02:36.520 --> 2:02:39.040
 And then there's a lot of smart people around Bitcoin

2:02:39.040 --> 2:02:41.800
 building kind of additional systems

2:02:41.800 --> 2:02:44.200
 that anchor their security within Bitcoin.

2:02:44.200 --> 2:02:45.920
 And I think that's an interesting approach

2:02:45.920 --> 2:02:47.520
 that could bear fruit.

2:02:48.360 --> 2:02:51.080
 I think it'll eventually require an interaction

2:02:51.080 --> 2:02:54.280
 with a Bitcoin protocol in more advanced ways.

2:02:54.280 --> 2:02:56.160
 And then there will be another question of,

2:02:56.160 --> 2:02:58.960
 what is the design decision for Bitcoin?

2:02:58.960 --> 2:03:02.520
 Is it that Bitcoin will be just about the Bitcoin ledger?

2:03:02.520 --> 2:03:05.200
 Or does Bitcoin want to evolve

2:03:05.200 --> 2:03:10.200
 into an anchor for all these other systems

2:03:10.560 --> 2:03:13.200
 and maybe create additional data store,

2:03:13.200 --> 2:03:15.440
 kind of more data on chain,

2:03:15.440 --> 2:03:18.240
 on the Bitcoin blockchain related to that?

2:03:18.240 --> 2:03:20.520
 So I'm excited to see how that evolves,

2:03:20.520 --> 2:03:23.520
 but until then kind of results speak for themselves

2:03:23.520 --> 2:03:25.760
 and the results that Bitcoin has achieved

2:03:25.760 --> 2:03:27.120
 for our industry and for itself

2:03:27.120 --> 2:03:30.200
 as kind of the dominant cryptocurrency

2:03:30.200 --> 2:03:31.880
 and the conception of our industry

2:03:31.880 --> 2:03:33.720
 that people interact with first

2:03:33.720 --> 2:03:36.280
 is obviously very important and something

2:03:36.280 --> 2:03:39.080
 that I think really everybody in our industry

2:03:39.080 --> 2:03:40.080
 is grateful for, right?

2:03:40.080 --> 2:03:43.880
 Because without Bitcoin, where would our industry be?

2:03:43.880 --> 2:03:46.840
 And that's obviously something that we can't forget.

2:03:46.840 --> 2:03:49.400
 What are your thoughts about Ethereum

2:03:49.400 --> 2:03:54.320
 in the chain link distributed Oracle network world?

2:03:55.280 --> 2:03:57.240
 Is it competition?

2:03:57.240 --> 2:03:59.320
 Is it collaboration?

2:03:59.320 --> 2:04:02.120
 Is it complimentary technology?

2:04:02.120 --> 2:04:03.400
 What do you think about Ethereum?

2:04:03.400 --> 2:04:05.200
 How much do you think about Ethereum?

2:04:05.200 --> 2:04:07.040
 What role does it have?

2:04:07.040 --> 2:04:08.400
 Yeah, I think about a lot.

2:04:08.400 --> 2:04:11.040
 I think we're completely complimentary.

2:04:11.040 --> 2:04:13.840
 So there's no competitive dynamics in my opinion.

2:04:13.840 --> 2:04:16.320
 We are completely collaborative and complimentary

2:04:16.320 --> 2:04:18.720
 with Ethereum and all other blockchains

2:04:18.720 --> 2:04:22.960
 and all other layer twos that operate a contract, right?

2:04:22.960 --> 2:04:26.120
 So we do not seek to operate a smart contract.

2:04:26.120 --> 2:04:29.800
 We seek to augment and enable smart contracts

2:04:29.800 --> 2:04:32.840
 to go further in what they're able to do.

2:04:32.840 --> 2:04:35.960
 In fact, Oracle networks have some value,

2:04:35.960 --> 2:04:38.360
 but they don't have nearly as much value in what they do

2:04:38.360 --> 2:04:40.480
 if there isn't a mission critical system

2:04:40.480 --> 2:04:43.320
 like a smart contract that needs their data, right?

2:04:43.320 --> 2:04:46.000
 So we've made our own explicit design decisions

2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:48.560
 in our own and created our own focus

2:04:48.560 --> 2:04:53.560
 around guaranteeing that smart contracts can go further.

2:04:53.760 --> 2:04:54.840
 We've already done that, right?

2:04:54.840 --> 2:04:57.760
 Decentralized finance, the rate at which we put data

2:04:57.760 --> 2:04:59.280
 is to a degree the rate at which certain

2:04:59.280 --> 2:05:01.360
 decentralized financial markets grow.

2:05:01.360 --> 2:05:03.160
 And as we put more data, we see more

2:05:03.160 --> 2:05:05.920
 financial products go live, gaming, we provide VRF.

2:05:05.920 --> 2:05:08.880
 So we have this kind of focus and it's a very useful

2:05:08.880 --> 2:05:13.680
 and valuable kind of, valuable for our industry focus.

2:05:13.680 --> 2:05:18.440
 At the end of the day, I think that smart contract platforms

2:05:18.440 --> 2:05:22.400
 like Ethereum made a different set of design decisions

2:05:22.400 --> 2:05:23.440
 from Bitcoin and others.

2:05:23.440 --> 2:05:27.520
 And they focused on creating the smart contract capability

2:05:27.520 --> 2:05:32.520
 and they kind of wanted that functionality to exist.

2:05:32.680 --> 2:05:34.360
 And I think since then, there's been a number of people

2:05:34.360 --> 2:05:37.920
 that try to improve on that or try to make variants of that.

2:05:37.920 --> 2:05:41.840
 From our point of view, we want to support smart contracts

2:05:41.840 --> 2:05:46.360
 in all of their variations and in all of their use cases.

2:05:46.360 --> 2:05:49.200
 So one of the things that I personally like about Chainlink

2:05:49.200 --> 2:05:52.400
 is their ability or Chainlink's ability

2:05:52.400 --> 2:05:54.320
 and the Chainlink network's ability to be useful

2:05:54.320 --> 2:05:58.400
 to many different chains and across many different use cases.

2:05:58.400 --> 2:06:00.400
 I'm personally a fan of Ethereum.

2:06:00.400 --> 2:06:03.200
 Ethereum has done a huge amount for our industry as well.

2:06:03.200 --> 2:06:06.400
 Ethereum took us from a world where it literally took months

2:06:06.400 --> 2:06:08.720
 to make a new smart contract by being forced

2:06:08.720 --> 2:06:10.960
 to code it into a protocol.

2:06:10.960 --> 2:06:12.560
 You had to go to the protocol developers

2:06:12.560 --> 2:06:15.360
 and you had to say, hey, I need a DEX

2:06:15.360 --> 2:06:17.360
 or I need some kind of smart contract.

2:06:17.360 --> 2:06:19.320
 Put it in the protocol itself.

2:06:19.320 --> 2:06:21.880
 Put it in the actual blockchain mining

2:06:21.880 --> 2:06:25.360
 and kind of block generation, transaction generation protocol.

2:06:25.360 --> 2:06:27.640
 That would take months or sometimes even over a year.

2:06:27.640 --> 2:06:29.040
 That was a horrible experience

2:06:29.040 --> 2:06:31.600
 and obviously very few people wanted to participate in that

2:06:31.600 --> 2:06:33.760
 and so very few people made smart contracts,

2:06:33.760 --> 2:06:35.880
 which I was not a fan of, right?

2:06:35.880 --> 2:06:37.160
 And then Ethereum came along

2:06:37.160 --> 2:06:39.680
 and really did a lot of innovative things

2:06:39.680 --> 2:06:43.360
 and introduced this approach to scriptable smart contracts

2:06:43.360 --> 2:06:46.960
 where you could script all of these different conditions.

2:06:46.960 --> 2:06:49.720
 And I found that fascinating before Ethereum.

2:06:49.720 --> 2:06:51.680
 I found that fascinating once Ethereum

2:06:51.680 --> 2:06:54.400
 arrived, I found it fascinating after Ethereum launched

2:06:54.400 --> 2:06:55.680
 and I still find it fascinating.

2:06:55.680 --> 2:06:58.640
 And I'm also very grateful to Vitalik

2:06:58.640 --> 2:07:01.320
 and the Ethereum community and all the core developers there

2:07:01.320 --> 2:07:03.960
 for taking our industry a step further.

2:07:03.960 --> 2:07:06.640
 So I think they absolutely deserve a huge amount of credit

2:07:06.640 --> 2:07:10.080
 for taking our industry from it takes months

2:07:10.080 --> 2:07:12.160
 to make a really small smart contract

2:07:12.160 --> 2:07:15.920
 to it takes weeks to make a relatively secure,

2:07:15.920 --> 2:07:18.240
 relatively advanced piece of on chain code

2:07:18.240 --> 2:07:21.560
 that anybody can script and people can do audits on

2:07:21.560 --> 2:07:25.560
 and that's an unbelievable leap forward for our industry

2:07:25.560 --> 2:07:28.240
 and I'm genuinely grateful to them for that.

2:07:29.200 --> 2:07:32.160
 I think the next step in line with our body of work

2:07:32.160 --> 2:07:36.400
 is how does that scriptable on chain code

2:07:36.400 --> 2:07:40.080
 become more advanced in its interaction

2:07:40.080 --> 2:07:44.360
 with all of the systems and events in the real world,

2:07:44.360 --> 2:07:47.080
 which is in my opinion, the final missing piece

2:07:47.080 --> 2:07:48.320
 of the puzzle, right?

2:07:48.320 --> 2:07:51.160
 So my body of work, the body of work that I'm involved in

2:07:51.160 --> 2:07:52.520
 would not be where it is right now

2:07:52.520 --> 2:07:54.560
 without Bitcoin by any measure.

2:07:54.560 --> 2:07:57.080
 It wouldn't even be where it is now without Ethereum

2:07:57.080 --> 2:07:59.640
 and the growth in smart contract development

2:07:59.640 --> 2:08:01.320
 that they've created.

2:08:01.320 --> 2:08:04.760
 And now what I think is gonna happen next

2:08:04.760 --> 2:08:07.520
 is there'll be a lot of different smart contract platforms,

2:08:07.520 --> 2:08:09.240
 a lot of different layer twos,

2:08:09.240 --> 2:08:10.960
 some of them will be private for enterprise,

2:08:10.960 --> 2:08:12.440
 some of them will be public,

2:08:12.440 --> 2:08:15.080
 there'll be some public winners in certain geographies

2:08:15.080 --> 2:08:18.000
 for maybe regulation reasons, maybe other reasons,

2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:21.840
 there'll be other public winners, the larger internet,

2:08:21.840 --> 2:08:23.480
 and there'll be a number of different people

2:08:23.480 --> 2:08:26.480
 building smart contracts in different languages.

2:08:26.480 --> 2:08:29.160
 We are excited and I am excited

2:08:29.160 --> 2:08:30.840
 and the Chainlink community is excited

2:08:30.840 --> 2:08:33.280
 and basically there's a lot of,

2:08:34.960 --> 2:08:36.960
 I mean, for lack of a better word, excitement

2:08:36.960 --> 2:08:39.960
 in seeing our industry graduate

2:08:39.960 --> 2:08:43.840
 to providing more use cases,

2:08:43.840 --> 2:08:46.720
 more usable hybrid smart contracts, right?

2:08:46.720 --> 2:08:49.200
 Because once again, it's absolutely amazing

2:08:49.200 --> 2:08:51.680
 that Bitcoin created non governmental fiat money.

2:08:51.680 --> 2:08:53.280
 It's an unbelievable innovation

2:08:53.280 --> 2:08:55.760
 and invented decentralized infrastructure

2:08:55.760 --> 2:08:57.440
 and birthed our industry.

2:08:57.440 --> 2:09:00.280
 It's an unbelievably great achievement,

2:09:00.280 --> 2:09:01.960
 an amazing achievement that we now have

2:09:01.960 --> 2:09:04.600
 scriptable smart contracts through something like Ethereum.

2:09:04.600 --> 2:09:07.640
 Once again, monumental achievement in my opinion.

2:09:08.560 --> 2:09:10.720
 Once again, we still need to look to the future.

2:09:10.720 --> 2:09:13.440
 We need to look to how do we take

2:09:13.440 --> 2:09:16.040
 the decentralized infrastructure concepts

2:09:16.040 --> 2:09:17.840
 that Bitcoin initially put forward,

2:09:17.840 --> 2:09:19.600
 that Ethereum then improved upon

2:09:19.600 --> 2:09:23.320
 and created into these scriptable smart contract formats,

2:09:23.320 --> 2:09:25.960
 and how do we expand that into the world

2:09:25.960 --> 2:09:28.640
 of real world outcomes to change

2:09:28.640 --> 2:09:31.280
 the global financial industry, the global trade industry,

2:09:31.280 --> 2:09:33.480
 the global data marketplace industry,

2:09:34.360 --> 2:09:36.160
 and many other global industries.

2:09:36.160 --> 2:09:38.240
 You mentioned results speak for themselves

2:09:38.240 --> 2:09:41.600
 and how design decisions have consequences.

2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:44.880
 The Chainlink community have come up

2:09:44.880 --> 2:09:48.040
 with a lot of brilliant designs.

2:09:48.040 --> 2:09:51.640
 So how do you think through the design choices

2:09:51.640 --> 2:09:55.440
 that you're facing where you can't predict the future,

2:09:55.440 --> 2:09:58.600
 but you're trying to create a better future?

2:09:58.600 --> 2:10:03.600
 Is there something low level introspective advice

2:10:05.080 --> 2:10:06.680
 that you can give or describe

2:10:06.680 --> 2:10:09.040
 as to how you think through those decisions

2:10:09.040 --> 2:10:12.040
 or high level how you think about those decisions?

2:10:12.040 --> 2:10:14.040
 Sure, absolutely.

2:10:14.040 --> 2:10:16.160
 I think that's a great question.

2:10:16.160 --> 2:10:18.360
 And I think that actually gets to the core

2:10:18.360 --> 2:10:22.160
 of what the Chainlink network is supposed to achieve.

2:10:22.160 --> 2:10:27.160
 We are supposed to achieve a maximally flexible system.

2:10:27.400 --> 2:10:28.960
 So once again, this is the big difference

2:10:28.960 --> 2:10:31.600
 between Chainlink and Oracle networks in general

2:10:31.600 --> 2:10:33.560
 and blockchains in my opinion.

2:10:33.560 --> 2:10:36.360
 Blockchains do not seek to be maximally flexible, right?

2:10:36.360 --> 2:10:39.320
 They say, here's my block size,

2:10:39.320 --> 2:10:43.920
 here's the transaction types you can put in those blocks.

2:10:43.920 --> 2:10:46.160
 Here's the contract language I have.

2:10:46.160 --> 2:10:48.600
 Here's kind of my blockchain system, right?

2:10:49.840 --> 2:10:51.640
 Here's the fee structure for those blocks.

2:10:51.640 --> 2:10:54.760
 They're gonna keep getting kind of composed,

2:10:54.760 --> 2:10:56.440
 transactions are gonna get put into blocks,

2:10:56.440 --> 2:10:58.360
 blocks will get connected and it'll continue, right?

2:10:58.360 --> 2:11:00.400
 And that's a very focused type of system.

2:11:00.400 --> 2:11:01.240
 And that's great.

2:11:01.240 --> 2:11:03.040
 And that makes sense because it's focused

2:11:03.040 --> 2:11:05.880
 on creating security for that category

2:11:05.880 --> 2:11:08.320
 of on chain activity, which is once again,

2:11:08.320 --> 2:11:10.280
 a critical, critical part of building

2:11:10.280 --> 2:11:12.280
 a highly transparent system and something

2:11:12.280 --> 2:11:14.920
 that Chainlink enables and doesn't compete with

2:11:14.920 --> 2:11:16.320
 and just enables to do more.

2:11:17.360 --> 2:11:21.360
 Oracle networks, conversely, have to interact

2:11:21.360 --> 2:11:25.520
 with all the world's data and provide all the services

2:11:25.520 --> 2:11:27.200
 that blockchains don't provide, right?

2:11:27.200 --> 2:11:28.520
 So there's kind of a spectrum.

2:11:28.520 --> 2:11:31.000
 On one end of the spectrum, you have blockchains

2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:33.360
 that are highly secure, highly reliable,

2:11:33.360 --> 2:11:36.600
 highly tamper proof, highly transparent,

2:11:36.600 --> 2:11:38.480
 but are not very feature rich.

2:11:38.480 --> 2:11:41.000
 For example, they cannot talk to an API.

2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:42.520
 Many of them can't generate randomness.

2:11:42.520 --> 2:11:46.160
 They cannot do some kind of privacy preserving computation.

2:11:46.160 --> 2:11:47.440
 So they're very secure.

2:11:47.440 --> 2:11:50.200
 And there are these kind of data structures

2:11:50.200 --> 2:11:53.880
 and smart contract platforms to hold on chain code

2:11:53.880 --> 2:11:57.280
 that can define conditions, receive value,

2:11:57.280 --> 2:11:59.280
 pay value back out under conditions

2:11:59.280 --> 2:12:01.000
 and create transparency around all that,

2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:03.040
 which makes perfect sense.

2:12:03.040 --> 2:12:06.720
 And then there's oracles and oracle networks.

2:12:06.720 --> 2:12:08.560
 That is all the world's data, right?

2:12:08.560 --> 2:12:11.320
 We're talking about taking all the world's data

2:12:11.320 --> 2:12:14.840
 and making it consumable for all the world's use cases

2:12:14.840 --> 2:12:16.520
 that have trust issues.

2:12:16.520 --> 2:12:19.400
 So the amount of variability there is absolutely massive,

2:12:19.400 --> 2:12:20.240
 right?

2:12:20.240 --> 2:12:22.560
 It's like the decentralized oracle network

2:12:22.560 --> 2:12:25.040
 and the conditions that that decentralized oracle network

2:12:25.040 --> 2:12:28.560
 needs to meet is gonna vary very widely

2:12:28.560 --> 2:12:32.280
 from an insurance contract to a lending contract

2:12:32.280 --> 2:12:36.680
 to an ad network contract to the data sales contract

2:12:36.680 --> 2:12:40.680
 that we discussed to any number of other smart contracts.

2:12:40.680 --> 2:12:44.600
 So really the ability of a decentralized oracle network

2:12:44.600 --> 2:12:47.800
 to flexibly address all of those requirements

2:12:47.800 --> 2:12:48.960
 is what's necessary.

2:12:49.840 --> 2:12:51.480
 So flexibility is the goal,

2:12:51.480 --> 2:12:55.280
 whereas with on chain like Bitcoin,

2:12:55.280 --> 2:12:58.280
 flexibility is the enemy in the sense

2:12:58.280 --> 2:13:03.280
 that you want security, you want the focus there.

2:13:03.360 --> 2:13:05.480
 And in that kind of world,

2:13:05.480 --> 2:13:08.040
 design decisions have huge consequences.

2:13:08.040 --> 2:13:11.040
 And then if you look at the distributed oracle network side,

2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:16.200
 you want to remove the restrictions of design choices.

2:13:16.200 --> 2:13:19.000
 You want to provide maximal flexibility then.

2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:23.720
 So it's a completely separate kind of a design framework.

2:13:23.720 --> 2:13:25.160
 It's a slightly different problem, right?

2:13:25.160 --> 2:13:28.200
 Because we're not trying to define transaction types

2:13:28.200 --> 2:13:30.440
 fitting into blocks on a certain timeline

2:13:30.440 --> 2:13:32.120
 of those blocks being generated.

2:13:32.120 --> 2:13:35.120
 We're trying to say, hey, there's this world of services

2:13:35.120 --> 2:13:37.640
 or this world of data that's not very deterministic,

2:13:37.640 --> 2:13:39.200
 but it's unbelievably useful

2:13:39.200 --> 2:13:40.800
 to these smart contracts over here.

2:13:40.800 --> 2:13:42.920
 And actually they need it to even exist.

2:13:42.920 --> 2:13:45.440
 And we really want them to exist because once they exist,

2:13:45.440 --> 2:13:46.640
 it's gonna completely redefine

2:13:46.640 --> 2:13:48.640
 what our whole industry is known for, right?

2:13:48.640 --> 2:13:51.520
 And defined NFTs are not even the tip of the iceberg.

2:13:51.520 --> 2:13:54.320
 They're like the snow coming off the top of the iceberg.

2:13:54.320 --> 2:13:57.320
 And so our goal is to create a framework

2:13:57.320 --> 2:14:00.000
 and an infrastructure and a software

2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:03.240
 that allows people to compose

2:14:03.240 --> 2:14:04.960
 decentralized oracle networks, right?

2:14:04.960 --> 2:14:08.920
 So initially you can compose a decentralized oracle network

2:14:08.920 --> 2:14:11.840
 of seven nodes that goes to three data sources

2:14:11.840 --> 2:14:14.200
 to trigger your contract worth a million dollars.

2:14:14.200 --> 2:14:15.400
 And that's where you could start.

2:14:15.400 --> 2:14:16.840
 And then let's say your smart contract,

2:14:16.840 --> 2:14:19.400
 your DeFi smart contract goes to a billion dollars.

2:14:19.400 --> 2:14:21.440
 Well, then you need to make some changes, right?

2:14:21.440 --> 2:14:23.000
 You need to go from seven nodes

2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:25.680
 to 15 or maybe 31 nodes.

2:14:25.680 --> 2:14:27.680
 And you need to go from three data sources

2:14:27.680 --> 2:14:29.040
 to five or seven.

2:14:29.040 --> 2:14:32.040
 And you maybe need to create some kind of

2:14:32.960 --> 2:14:36.000
 what we call circuit breakers and some other checks.

2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:36.920
 And you need to make sure

2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:38.960
 that the decentralized oracle network

2:14:38.960 --> 2:14:40.560
 comes to consensus around those checks.

2:14:40.560 --> 2:14:42.600
 Because now the centralized oracle network

2:14:42.600 --> 2:14:43.760
 isn't controlling a million dollars,

2:14:43.760 --> 2:14:45.240
 it's controlling a billion dollars.

2:14:45.240 --> 2:14:47.000
 And we have decentralized oracle networks

2:14:47.000 --> 2:14:48.640
 that control well over a billion dollars,

2:14:48.640 --> 2:14:50.320
 multiple billions of dollars.

2:14:50.320 --> 2:14:52.240
 And we see them growing and getting more advanced

2:14:52.240 --> 2:14:55.000
 data sources and more advanced features.

2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:56.760
 And then if somebody else comes and says,

2:14:56.760 --> 2:14:59.000
 well, I don't really wanna make a DeFi product,

2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:00.520
 I wanna make crop insurance.

2:15:00.520 --> 2:15:02.600
 And I have a completely different set of conditions.

2:15:02.600 --> 2:15:04.360
 I want this method of consensus

2:15:04.360 --> 2:15:06.840
 and I want data to be aggregated in this way,

2:15:06.840 --> 2:15:07.840
 but not the way that you do

2:15:07.840 --> 2:15:09.920
 for decentralized financial products.

2:15:09.920 --> 2:15:10.960
 I mean, what are we supposed to tell them?

2:15:10.960 --> 2:15:12.960
 We're supposed to tell them, no,

2:15:12.960 --> 2:15:15.600
 our decentralized oracle network can't let you do that.

2:15:15.600 --> 2:15:18.680
 And you can go and wait another five years

2:15:18.680 --> 2:15:21.520
 until somebody builds it for you.

2:15:21.520 --> 2:15:23.200
 That's not what we wanna do, right?

2:15:23.200 --> 2:15:24.880
 What we wanna do is be able to say,

2:15:24.880 --> 2:15:29.040
 absolutely, here's an example of how somebody else

2:15:29.040 --> 2:15:33.040
 made a decentralized oracle network for weather insurance.

2:15:34.800 --> 2:15:37.440
 Here's a template, change that template,

2:15:37.440 --> 2:15:39.880
 evolve it to meet your needs.

2:15:39.880 --> 2:15:41.240
 And then someone else comes and says,

2:15:41.240 --> 2:15:44.760
 hey, I have some other use case in gaming, right?

2:15:44.760 --> 2:15:48.120
 I wanna make NFTs related to real world sports events,

2:15:48.120 --> 2:15:49.400
 or I wanna do whatever I wanna do

2:15:49.400 --> 2:15:52.480
 with some kind of sports related data.

2:15:52.480 --> 2:15:54.600
 Wonderful, here's the framework,

2:15:54.600 --> 2:15:56.640
 here are your risk dynamics,

2:15:56.640 --> 2:15:58.920
 here's a collection of node operators,

2:15:58.920 --> 2:16:02.320
 here's a set of preintegrated data sources,

2:16:02.320 --> 2:16:05.320
 here's a reputation system to assess

2:16:05.320 --> 2:16:08.320
 the quality of your ensemble of nodes,

2:16:08.320 --> 2:16:09.800
 here's a way to scale that up

2:16:09.800 --> 2:16:13.040
 as the value in your contract scales.

2:16:13.040 --> 2:16:17.000
 Here's all the tools that you need to build this contract.

2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:20.600
 And what we actually see now as there are multiple types

2:16:20.600 --> 2:16:23.520
 of computations and data sources that are provided

2:16:23.520 --> 2:16:25.920
 by different decentralized oracle networks,

2:16:25.920 --> 2:16:27.920
 of which there are now hundreds,

2:16:27.920 --> 2:16:31.680
 we now see that a single hybrid smart contract

2:16:31.680 --> 2:16:34.480
 might use multiple decentralized oracle networks.

2:16:34.480 --> 2:16:36.520
 So there might be a hybrid smart contract

2:16:36.520 --> 2:16:39.720
 that uses a price data, decentralized oracle network,

2:16:39.720 --> 2:16:41.720
 a proof of reserve oracle network,

2:16:41.720 --> 2:16:43.920
 a randomness oracle network.

2:16:43.920 --> 2:16:45.920
 And I think we're gonna continue to see

2:16:45.920 --> 2:16:49.640
 this dynamic that more and more advanced contracts

2:16:49.640 --> 2:16:53.440
 compose various decentralized oracle networks

2:16:53.440 --> 2:16:55.760
 into more advanced use cases.

2:16:55.760 --> 2:17:00.760
 And this is the dynamic that we're focused on enabling.

2:17:01.280 --> 2:17:03.400
 And I think it's actually a very virtuous cycle

2:17:03.400 --> 2:17:05.760
 for everybody because the more of these

2:17:05.760 --> 2:17:08.720
 hybrid smart contracts we enable on Ethereum

2:17:08.720 --> 2:17:11.800
 and other blockchains, the more our industry

2:17:11.800 --> 2:17:15.520
 provides real world outcomes to the market.

2:17:15.520 --> 2:17:18.280
 To the larger world, which is at the end of the day,

2:17:18.280 --> 2:17:21.040
 what I think everybody in our industry wants.

2:17:21.040 --> 2:17:24.640
 Everybody in our industry wants hybrid smart contracts

2:17:24.640 --> 2:17:28.080
 to become the way that global finance works,

2:17:28.080 --> 2:17:31.200
 global trade works, global insurance products work,

2:17:31.200 --> 2:17:34.240
 because they will inherently need both a blockchain

2:17:34.240 --> 2:17:36.880
 on which the contract itself lives

2:17:36.880 --> 2:17:39.200
 and an oracle network that powers

2:17:39.200 --> 2:17:41.800
 all of the other interactions, right?

2:17:41.800 --> 2:17:44.400
 As a developer, how would you recommend

2:17:44.400 --> 2:17:48.400
 somebody listening to this, but also me,

2:17:50.200 --> 2:17:52.880
 to get started with smart contracts

2:17:52.880 --> 2:17:56.040
 and to get started with hybrid smart contracts?

2:17:57.200 --> 2:17:59.080
 Well, for hybrid smart contracts,

2:17:59.080 --> 2:18:01.680
 I'm gonna have to do some kind of shameless promotion.

2:18:01.680 --> 2:18:04.320
 Please, let me twist your arm.

2:18:05.320 --> 2:18:06.640
 Thank you.

2:18:06.640 --> 2:18:08.520
 I think you can go to our YouTube.

2:18:08.520 --> 2:18:11.080
 We have a number of developer tutorials.

2:18:11.080 --> 2:18:12.160
 Chainlink YouTube?

2:18:12.160 --> 2:18:13.360
 Yeah, Chainlink.

2:18:13.360 --> 2:18:14.880
 I think if you just search Chainlink on YouTube,

2:18:14.880 --> 2:18:16.120
 you should find it.

2:18:17.560 --> 2:18:19.800
 Beyond that, we recently had a hackathon

2:18:19.800 --> 2:18:22.440
 where we had a huge amount of very kind of

2:18:22.440 --> 2:18:25.000
 advanced hybrid smart contracts getting built.

2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:28.280
 To elaborate on that, you had a hackathon.

2:18:28.280 --> 2:18:30.560
 Is that something that people can follow along

2:18:30.560 --> 2:18:35.560
 like a video or there's web page traces of what happened?

2:18:35.560 --> 2:18:37.640
 Or is there a future actual hackathons

2:18:37.640 --> 2:18:39.560
 that people could literally participate in?

2:18:39.560 --> 2:18:41.520
 There's plenty of more hackathons coming up.

2:18:41.520 --> 2:18:44.440
 We wanna enable as many developers in web3 and web2

2:18:44.440 --> 2:18:46.080
 to build hybrid smart contracts

2:18:46.080 --> 2:18:47.880
 as a way to redefine our industry

2:18:47.880 --> 2:18:52.280
 and kind of make all of these smart contracts come to life.

2:18:52.280 --> 2:18:54.040
 There are definitely gonna be more hackathons.

2:18:54.040 --> 2:18:56.720
 So people should go and preregister or register

2:18:56.720 --> 2:18:58.240
 on a list to get involved in that.

2:18:58.240 --> 2:19:00.240
 That's a great resource where we have a lot of speakers

2:19:00.240 --> 2:19:01.440
 and a lot of educational tools.

2:19:01.440 --> 2:19:04.680
 They happen over a course of weeks, not days.

2:19:04.680 --> 2:19:07.080
 So there's a long time for people to work on these things

2:19:07.080 --> 2:19:09.800
 at the speed that they find comfortable.

2:19:09.800 --> 2:19:10.640
 Two questions.

2:19:10.640 --> 2:19:14.400
 One, is there a kind of hello world entry point

2:19:14.400 --> 2:19:17.640
 for hybrid smart contracts?

2:19:17.640 --> 2:19:19.640
 And two, on the hackathon side,

2:19:19.640 --> 2:19:22.360
 what kind of stuff do you see people building at first?

2:19:22.360 --> 2:19:24.480
 Just kind of getting their feet wet

2:19:25.440 --> 2:19:28.880
 in terms of the kind of applications that could be enabled.

2:19:28.880 --> 2:19:30.480
 I mean, there's unbelievable things

2:19:30.480 --> 2:19:32.440
 that we see people building.

2:19:32.440 --> 2:19:35.160
 I think how to get your feet wet,

2:19:35.160 --> 2:19:37.160
 I think the hello world is probably DeFi

2:19:37.160 --> 2:19:38.520
 because it's pretty straightforward.

2:19:38.520 --> 2:19:40.280
 And there's a large amount of data sources

2:19:40.280 --> 2:19:42.800
 that we already have putting data on chain on test net,

2:19:42.800 --> 2:19:45.360
 which is the test environment in which people would build.

2:19:45.360 --> 2:19:47.800
 So I think DeFi is probably to a certain degree

2:19:47.800 --> 2:19:49.240
 the most exciting for certain people

2:19:49.240 --> 2:19:54.160
 and pretty expansive in terms of the tutorials

2:19:54.160 --> 2:19:55.360
 and the amount of contracts

2:19:55.360 --> 2:19:57.760
 to see how people have already built it.

2:19:57.760 --> 2:19:58.600
 I think beyond that,

2:19:58.600 --> 2:20:01.040
 we see people building amazing things at these hackathons.

2:20:01.040 --> 2:20:02.400
 In the previous hackathon,

2:20:02.400 --> 2:20:04.720
 we saw somebody build a smart contract

2:20:04.720 --> 2:20:09.440
 that allows someone to rent out their Tesla.

2:20:09.440 --> 2:20:14.440
 So it allows the Tesla API to give someone else access

2:20:14.680 --> 2:20:16.600
 and rent out someone's Tesla

2:20:16.600 --> 2:20:19.880
 on the basis of a smart contract kind of coordinating payment,

2:20:19.880 --> 2:20:22.480
 which was kind of amazing.

2:20:22.480 --> 2:20:23.880
 The more recent hackathon,

2:20:23.880 --> 2:20:25.600
 we saw something called Dbridge,

2:20:25.600 --> 2:20:28.400
 which is a cross chain solution that uses Oracle networks

2:20:28.400 --> 2:20:30.640
 to confirm data on different chains.

2:20:30.640 --> 2:20:33.880
 So I think the things that people build

2:20:33.880 --> 2:20:36.840
 will just become expansive and varied

2:20:36.840 --> 2:20:40.120
 in ways that I can't even imagine.

2:20:40.120 --> 2:20:44.440
 But I think this recent hackathon saw a huge, huge list

2:20:44.440 --> 2:20:48.080
 of different kind of winners in different categories.

2:20:48.080 --> 2:20:49.360
 And there's so many different categories.

2:20:49.360 --> 2:20:50.840
 We even have a GovTech category

2:20:50.840 --> 2:20:53.120
 and a whole bunch of things.

2:20:53.120 --> 2:20:54.640
 If people wanna see what's possible,

2:20:54.640 --> 2:20:55.960
 they can go look at the winners.

2:20:55.960 --> 2:20:57.960
 I think that's probably a good idea.

2:20:59.480 --> 2:21:01.400
 Yeah, that'll be on the side of the hackathon.

2:21:01.400 --> 2:21:03.880
 There's a blog related to that,

2:21:03.880 --> 2:21:05.400
 and we're gonna have more of these.

2:21:05.400 --> 2:21:08.440
 And once again, our explicit goal

2:21:08.440 --> 2:21:11.560
 is to take our industry into this world

2:21:11.560 --> 2:21:14.800
 of hybrid smart contracts, which just benefits everybody.

2:21:14.800 --> 2:21:16.920
 It makes more on chain activity.

2:21:16.920 --> 2:21:21.080
 It helps provide real world value to the average person

2:21:21.080 --> 2:21:23.560
 from all of this infrastructure period.

2:21:23.560 --> 2:21:25.040
 And at the end of the day,

2:21:25.040 --> 2:21:28.560
 I think that it just redefines what our industry is about

2:21:28.560 --> 2:21:29.560
 through use cases, right?

2:21:29.560 --> 2:21:33.080
 Because if you only learn through our industry

2:21:33.080 --> 2:21:35.040
 from the point of view of a single use case,

2:21:35.040 --> 2:21:37.640
 like the NFT use case or some other use case,

2:21:37.640 --> 2:21:39.680
 that's what our industry is about.

2:21:39.680 --> 2:21:41.600
 And the more of these use cases

2:21:41.600 --> 2:21:44.280
 that people can make available to the average person

2:21:44.280 --> 2:21:46.680
 or to the FinTech world or to the insurance world

2:21:46.680 --> 2:21:50.720
 or wherever, the faster our industry will not just be

2:21:50.720 --> 2:21:52.600
 about Bitcoins or tokens,

2:21:52.600 --> 2:21:55.160
 it will be about changing global finance,

2:21:55.160 --> 2:21:58.080
 changing global insurance, changing global trade.

2:21:58.080 --> 2:22:00.360
 And that's the change in the world

2:22:00.360 --> 2:22:02.640
 that I and a lot of other people in this industry,

2:22:02.640 --> 2:22:04.680
 I think, got into this for.

2:22:04.680 --> 2:22:06.920
 Now it's funny, you've mentioned about,

2:22:06.920 --> 2:22:09.440
 you've had a lot of kind words to say about Bitcoin

2:22:09.440 --> 2:22:12.400
 and Ethereum as important technology

2:22:12.400 --> 2:22:14.440
 that paved the way for the future.

2:22:14.440 --> 2:22:16.920
 And you somehow did not mention

2:22:16.920 --> 2:22:18.760
 one of the most profound pieces of technology,

2:22:18.760 --> 2:22:20.400
 which is Dogecoin.

2:22:20.400 --> 2:22:22.880
 What are your thoughts about this particular

2:22:24.800 --> 2:22:26.280
 revolutionary technology?

2:22:26.280 --> 2:22:28.000
 And what are your thoughts about Dogecoin

2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:30.120
 going to the moon, to Mars,

2:22:30.120 --> 2:22:32.520
 and outside of the solar system?

2:22:32.520 --> 2:22:36.600
 I think Dogecoin is a very interesting kind of,

2:22:36.600 --> 2:22:40.040
 probably closer to a social experiment than anything else.

2:22:40.040 --> 2:22:42.840
 Isn't everything a social experiment?

2:22:42.840 --> 2:22:45.160
 Yeah, I guess that's fair to a degree.

2:22:46.360 --> 2:22:49.160
 I think it's fascinating how that's evolved.

2:22:49.160 --> 2:22:51.320
 I think the people that made it

2:22:51.320 --> 2:22:53.080
 with certain goals in mind

2:22:53.080 --> 2:22:56.080
 and then it's kind of taken on a life of its own.

2:22:56.080 --> 2:22:59.000
 I don't fully understand exactly why it's taken on a life

2:22:59.000 --> 2:23:01.040
 of its own at this point.

2:23:01.040 --> 2:23:03.040
 I once again, I don't spend too much time

2:23:03.040 --> 2:23:07.080
 thinking about different tokens and how they're evolving.

2:23:07.080 --> 2:23:10.720
 I'm much more focused on the launching and...

2:23:10.720 --> 2:23:15.040
 The technology around trust and all those kinds of ideas.

2:23:15.040 --> 2:23:18.840
 But I think one of the fascinating things about Dogecoin

2:23:18.840 --> 2:23:23.840
 is how technology that leverages social dynamics,

2:23:23.840 --> 2:23:28.840
 that technology's ability to utilize fun and memes to spread.

2:23:30.240 --> 2:23:31.800
 I think it's really interesting.

2:23:31.800 --> 2:23:35.280
 I don't think it should be discounted as a...

2:23:35.280 --> 2:23:36.960
 I think I tweeted today something

2:23:36.960 --> 2:23:40.480
 about like the fundamental force field of fun.

2:23:41.600 --> 2:23:45.080
 That fun has an effect on the space time.

2:23:45.080 --> 2:23:50.080
 So general relativity describes how mass and energy

2:23:50.080 --> 2:23:53.920
 can curve space time. And I was just giving an example

2:23:53.920 --> 2:23:56.360
 that when life is fun, it seems short.

2:23:56.360 --> 2:23:58.560
 When life is not fun, it seems very long.

2:23:58.560 --> 2:24:01.080
 So fun has a very similar effect on space time,

2:24:01.080 --> 2:24:02.720
 like in curved space time.

2:24:02.720 --> 2:24:07.200
 In that same sense, there is a power to the meme.

2:24:07.200 --> 2:24:09.480
 And I think Dogecoin illustrates that.

2:24:09.480 --> 2:24:12.680
 I think Elon is an example of somebody that uses Dogecoin.

2:24:12.680 --> 2:24:16.600
 I don't know his philosophy in particular on this aspect,

2:24:16.600 --> 2:24:18.240
 but he does use Dogecoin.

2:24:18.240 --> 2:24:23.240
 But he does use it effectively to excite the world

2:24:23.720 --> 2:24:26.400
 in a fun way about the possibilities

2:24:26.400 --> 2:24:29.080
 of future technologies like cryptocurrency.

2:24:29.080 --> 2:24:32.120
 I think the Bitcoin world is very serious right now.

2:24:33.200 --> 2:24:36.760
 We've spoken about Bitcoin maximalists.

2:24:36.760 --> 2:24:40.800
 There is very little space for fun and joking

2:24:40.800 --> 2:24:45.800
 in the Bitcoin world, but there's still a little bit of fun

2:24:45.800 --> 2:24:48.600
 and humor left in the Dogecoin world.

2:24:48.600 --> 2:24:51.640
 In that sense, I think it's exceptionally powerful

2:24:51.640 --> 2:24:56.640
 to inspire, to excite, to be able to talk about stuff

2:24:57.320 --> 2:25:02.320
 without the seriousness of financial impact

2:25:05.080 --> 2:25:08.880
 that now certain cryptocurrencies have like Bitcoin.

2:25:08.880 --> 2:25:12.520
 So I keep an eye on, I've previously mentioned

2:25:12.520 --> 2:25:16.120
 that Dogecoin I think is a fascinating piece of technology

2:25:16.120 --> 2:25:19.120
 because I do think cryptocurrency is much bigger

2:25:19.120 --> 2:25:23.880
 than the technology that you focus on.

2:25:23.880 --> 2:25:27.760
 There is also a social element that you also spoke to

2:25:27.760 --> 2:25:31.120
 that's I think not quite yet understood

2:25:31.120 --> 2:25:35.440
 and it's fascinating to watch, especially as it covalls

2:25:35.440 --> 2:25:37.360
 with the different tools on the internet,

2:25:37.360 --> 2:25:39.640
 the different social networks,

2:25:39.640 --> 2:25:42.160
 social network mechanisms on the internet.

2:25:42.160 --> 2:25:46.200
 So I'm a huge supporter of Dogecoin

2:25:46.200 --> 2:25:48.000
 because I'm a huge supporter of fun.

2:25:49.880 --> 2:25:52.120
 I'm fascinated to see how it'll work out.

2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:55.680
 You think it'll go to the moon?

2:25:55.680 --> 2:25:57.600
 You think it'll be the first cryptocurrency

2:25:57.600 --> 2:25:59.240
 to land on the moon?

2:25:59.240 --> 2:26:00.080
 I couldn't say.

2:26:00.080 --> 2:26:04.240
 I haven't done the analysis as I've said before.

2:26:04.240 --> 2:26:05.640
 I haven't done the analysis.

2:26:05.640 --> 2:26:09.640
 Well, yeah, no matter what,

2:26:09.640 --> 2:26:12.520
 I do hope we will get humans back on the moon

2:26:12.520 --> 2:26:15.320
 and hopefully get humans on Mars soon.

2:26:15.320 --> 2:26:20.320
 Dogecoin, Bitcoin or not.

2:26:21.320 --> 2:26:25.960
 Let me ask you about books and movies.

2:26:25.960 --> 2:26:30.400
 What books and movies in your life long ago

2:26:30.400 --> 2:26:35.400
 when you were a baby Sergei or today had an impact on you?

2:26:36.720 --> 2:26:39.080
 Maybe you would recommend to others

2:26:39.080 --> 2:26:43.640
 and maybe what ideas you took away from those books,

2:26:43.640 --> 2:26:48.280
 movies, coloring books, children's books, blogs, whatever.

2:26:49.280 --> 2:26:50.480
 Yeah, yeah, sure.

2:26:51.440 --> 2:26:54.000
 So I think one of the things that had a very big impact

2:26:54.000 --> 2:26:56.000
 on me were Plato's dialogues

2:26:56.000 --> 2:26:58.240
 and particularly Protagoras and Gorgias

2:26:58.240 --> 2:27:01.520
 as some of the two initial ones.

2:27:02.760 --> 2:27:05.600
 I think what Plato's dialogues do very well

2:27:05.600 --> 2:27:09.520
 is they give people a clear picture of what dialogue looks

2:27:09.520 --> 2:27:11.440
 like and what the assessment

2:27:11.440 --> 2:27:15.240
 of information probably should look like, right?

2:27:15.240 --> 2:27:18.480
 And how the dissection and analysis

2:27:18.480 --> 2:27:20.480
 of an idea is very important

2:27:20.480 --> 2:27:22.840
 and how it can actually be taken in either direction.

2:27:22.840 --> 2:27:25.840
 But at the end of the day that the process

2:27:25.840 --> 2:27:30.000
 of eliminating kind of this fuzzy thinking

2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:33.360
 and arriving at whether it's an external dialogue

2:27:33.360 --> 2:27:36.520
 or an internal dialogue about an accurate picture

2:27:36.520 --> 2:27:38.960
 of reality is actually very important.

2:27:38.960 --> 2:27:42.480
 And so I think I'm very lucky to have read the dialogues

2:27:42.480 --> 2:27:44.920
 when I was in my early teenage years

2:27:44.920 --> 2:27:46.480
 and it had a very large impact on me

2:27:46.480 --> 2:27:49.520
 because it kind of showed me that nobody knows

2:27:49.520 --> 2:27:51.000
 what they're talking about.

2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:54.200
 I would play out dialogues in my mind

2:27:55.120 --> 2:27:56.760
 and I would engage in certain dialogues

2:27:56.760 --> 2:27:58.920
 with different people.

2:27:58.920 --> 2:28:02.360
 And what the Platonic dialogue showed me was kind

2:28:02.360 --> 2:28:06.000
 of how to tell when someone has no clue.

2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:07.360
 And a lot of people are very good

2:28:07.360 --> 2:28:12.360
 at kind of say they have a clue, right?

2:28:12.680 --> 2:28:14.280
 Saying like, here's how the world works.

2:28:14.280 --> 2:28:15.520
 Here's what you should do with your life.

2:28:15.520 --> 2:28:16.760
 Here's what you should do with your time.

2:28:16.760 --> 2:28:18.000
 Here's what you should do with your money.

2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:19.800
 Here's what you should do with your attention.

2:28:19.800 --> 2:28:22.400
 Here's what you should do with all these things.

2:28:22.400 --> 2:28:26.280
 And I think the ability to evaluate information

2:28:26.280 --> 2:28:31.000
 generally is something that is surprisingly under taught.

2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:33.840
 I don't actually understand why there isn't a course

2:28:33.840 --> 2:28:35.880
 in like high schools or universities

2:28:35.880 --> 2:28:39.320
 that's just like, here is how you evaluate information.

2:28:39.320 --> 2:28:41.640
 Here's how you engage in external dialogue

2:28:41.640 --> 2:28:43.640
 and internal dialogue to arrive

2:28:43.640 --> 2:28:45.480
 at an accurate picture of reality

2:28:45.480 --> 2:28:47.200
 rather than the picture of reality

2:28:47.200 --> 2:28:48.600
 that other people want you to have

2:28:48.600 --> 2:28:50.560
 for their benefit most often, right?

2:28:50.560 --> 2:28:52.760
 And at the end of the day,

2:28:52.760 --> 2:28:54.800
 I think that put me down a path

2:28:54.800 --> 2:28:57.120
 to really try and understand.

2:28:57.120 --> 2:29:00.280
 Beyond that, I think biographies

2:29:00.280 --> 2:29:02.880
 have had a very large impact on me.

2:29:03.960 --> 2:29:05.800
 Plutarchs, Greek and Roman lives.

2:29:05.800 --> 2:29:07.080
 After I read Plato,

2:29:07.080 --> 2:29:09.000
 I started reading a bunch of stuff, Greek stuff.

2:29:09.000 --> 2:29:10.360
 I was just like, these Greek guys,

2:29:10.360 --> 2:29:12.440
 they really know how it is.

2:29:12.440 --> 2:29:15.360
 They did this 2000 years ago and they still got it right.

2:29:15.360 --> 2:29:16.600
 There's something here.

2:29:16.600 --> 2:29:19.640
 It's kind of this like a theory of time around them,

2:29:19.640 --> 2:29:21.080
 the value of intellectual ideas, right?

2:29:21.080 --> 2:29:24.800
 If an intellectual idea has survived the test of time,

2:29:24.800 --> 2:29:27.160
 it's much more valuable than the intellectual idea

2:29:27.160 --> 2:29:28.720
 that I just came up with 10 minutes ago,

2:29:28.720 --> 2:29:31.320
 I haven't told anybody and hasn't gone up against

2:29:31.320 --> 2:29:35.880
 all of the kind of rebuttals.

2:29:35.880 --> 2:29:36.840
 So...

2:29:36.840 --> 2:29:37.760
 So what's your favorite,

2:29:37.760 --> 2:29:41.240
 what would you say would be a most impactful biography

2:29:41.240 --> 2:29:43.280
 that you've come across?

2:29:43.280 --> 2:29:45.640
 I don't think it was those Greek or Roman biographies

2:29:45.640 --> 2:29:48.560
 because they were very far away.

2:29:48.560 --> 2:29:53.560
 I think that probably one of the most impactful ones

2:29:53.560 --> 2:29:58.400
 that I can remember recently is around Vanderbilt.

2:29:59.320 --> 2:30:03.640
 And so Vanderbilt was this guy who basically,

2:30:03.640 --> 2:30:05.160
 without that much of an education,

2:30:05.160 --> 2:30:08.760
 he would invent or work with people

2:30:08.760 --> 2:30:10.160
 to make these steamboats.

2:30:10.160 --> 2:30:12.080
 And then he had a lot of acumen

2:30:12.080 --> 2:30:15.480
 around creating certain monopolies,

2:30:15.480 --> 2:30:20.480
 regardless of what was right or wasn't right.

2:30:20.480 --> 2:30:22.080
 Right or wasn't right.

2:30:22.080 --> 2:30:23.200
 And then fascinating enough,

2:30:23.200 --> 2:30:25.480
 it all hinged on like a Supreme Court case

2:30:25.480 --> 2:30:29.120
 that decided if monopolies were acceptable

2:30:29.120 --> 2:30:31.920
 in the form of state created monopolies or not.

2:30:32.880 --> 2:30:36.800
 And if it was deemed that state created monopolies

2:30:36.800 --> 2:30:39.440
 were acceptable, he would have had a huge problem, this guy.

2:30:39.440 --> 2:30:41.880
 But it was deemed that state created monopolies

2:30:41.880 --> 2:30:46.040
 through these licenses for steamboat routes

2:30:46.040 --> 2:30:47.880
 was not acceptable.

2:30:47.880 --> 2:30:51.200
 And that did two interesting things that unseated

2:30:51.200 --> 2:30:55.560
 some kind of old time landed gentry in the Americas

2:30:55.560 --> 2:30:57.920
 in like the 1830s and 40s.

2:30:57.920 --> 2:31:00.840
 And it basically made him right

2:31:00.840 --> 2:31:03.160
 and he saw it before other people.

2:31:03.160 --> 2:31:08.160
 So I think Vanderbilt was a very interesting personality,

2:31:08.200 --> 2:31:11.520
 first of all, of all the biographies that I read

2:31:11.520 --> 2:31:16.520
 is somebody who really took the situation in hand

2:31:16.520 --> 2:31:20.120
 and kind of took action to achieve an outcome,

2:31:20.120 --> 2:31:23.840
 which I think was an amazing result.

2:31:23.840 --> 2:31:26.200
 The fascinating thing, by the way,

2:31:26.200 --> 2:31:28.360
 is, or amazing way of looking at things.

2:31:28.360 --> 2:31:29.440
 The fascinating thing, by the way,

2:31:29.440 --> 2:31:32.200
 is that the ferries now in New York Harbor

2:31:32.200 --> 2:31:36.000
 are all run as a public good.

2:31:36.000 --> 2:31:37.680
 So the fascinating thing is that the guy,

2:31:37.680 --> 2:31:40.680
 he focused on an industry and he worked on something

2:31:40.680 --> 2:31:42.800
 that was so important that it ended up

2:31:42.800 --> 2:31:44.920
 becoming a public good.

2:31:44.920 --> 2:31:48.720
 And I think that that's an interesting conception

2:31:48.720 --> 2:31:51.800
 of how to look at this industry.

2:31:51.800 --> 2:31:54.400
 I think there's a lot of economics dynamics

2:31:54.400 --> 2:31:55.680
 around this industry,

2:31:55.680 --> 2:31:58.960
 but I think I might've said this somewhere else before,

2:31:58.960 --> 2:32:02.360
 but really the success of someone in this industry

2:32:03.240 --> 2:32:06.640
 is whether they're able to make a Linux or HTTP

2:32:06.640 --> 2:32:11.640
 or an HTTPS like system that lives on for a very long time

2:32:11.640 --> 2:32:14.400
 and is essentially a kind of public good.

2:32:14.400 --> 2:32:16.840
 It's a success of an idea,

2:32:16.840 --> 2:32:19.960
 even if that idea is originally sort of a capitalist idea

2:32:19.960 --> 2:32:23.000
 above that's grounded in financial benefit.

2:32:23.000 --> 2:32:26.000
 Success of it is if it becomes a public good.

2:32:26.000 --> 2:32:27.640
 It is so universal.

2:32:27.640 --> 2:32:30.880
 It is so fundamental to the quality of life

2:32:30.880 --> 2:32:32.120
 that it's a public good.

2:32:32.120 --> 2:32:34.880
 It is deemed to be so valuable

2:32:34.880 --> 2:32:36.480
 that it should be a public good.

2:32:37.480 --> 2:32:38.320
 Yeah, I think so.

2:32:38.320 --> 2:32:39.640
 I think that's a pretty,

2:32:39.640 --> 2:32:42.160
 a pretty good definition of success that you work

2:32:42.160 --> 2:32:44.560
 on a body of work and that body of work

2:32:44.560 --> 2:32:47.200
 isn't just some commercial enterprise.

2:32:47.200 --> 2:32:51.480
 It's a body of work that whatever commercial aspects

2:32:51.480 --> 2:32:54.560
 or economic incentive aspects it might have,

2:32:54.560 --> 2:32:56.640
 it eventually is so important

2:32:56.640 --> 2:33:00.560
 that it becomes critical to how society functions.

2:33:00.560 --> 2:33:04.800
 I'm personally quite lucky and grateful to be,

2:33:04.800 --> 2:33:07.400
 in my opinion, working on something like that

2:33:07.400 --> 2:33:11.000
 with an amazing team and an amazing community

2:33:11.000 --> 2:33:13.280
 that seems to really very much care

2:33:13.280 --> 2:33:18.280
 about this hybrid smart contract transparent world

2:33:18.280 --> 2:33:20.600
 that a lot of people on our industry,

2:33:20.600 --> 2:33:23.520
 realistically, I think this is why a lot of them signed up.

2:33:23.520 --> 2:33:25.360
 This is why I came into our industry.

2:33:25.360 --> 2:33:27.920
 It wasn't because Bitcoin,

2:33:27.920 --> 2:33:32.040
 it was because Bitcoin was a picture

2:33:32.040 --> 2:33:34.960
 of how the world could work in so many other ways.

2:33:34.960 --> 2:33:37.480
 And that picture of how the world could work

2:33:37.480 --> 2:33:41.440
 in so many other ways attracted me a very long time ago.

2:33:42.840 --> 2:33:47.360
 And I think that all of this stuff

2:33:47.360 --> 2:33:49.320
 will eventually become a public good.

2:33:49.320 --> 2:33:50.960
 I think it will become so critical

2:33:50.960 --> 2:33:54.360
 to how societies function internally and internationally

2:33:54.360 --> 2:33:56.360
 that just like there are systems,

2:33:56.360 --> 2:33:59.360
 like the Federal Reserve, like global payment systems,

2:33:59.360 --> 2:34:00.720
 like all these types of things,

2:34:00.720 --> 2:34:03.240
 I think eventually all of this technology

2:34:03.240 --> 2:34:08.240
 will be baked into these societally critical systems.

2:34:08.440 --> 2:34:11.320
 And if I, in our community and the people I work with

2:34:11.320 --> 2:34:13.680
 and the body of work that we're working on

2:34:13.680 --> 2:34:17.080
 can make some kind of contribution to that shift

2:34:18.200 --> 2:34:22.640
 towards a fairer, economically fair, transparent society,

2:34:23.760 --> 2:34:27.040
 from my point of view, it's a very worthwhile body of work.

2:34:27.040 --> 2:34:30.640
 In terms of the show, you also mentioned the show,

2:34:30.640 --> 2:34:33.960
 one of the shows that I really seem to like more and more

2:34:33.960 --> 2:34:37.640
 for some reason is Star Trek, not the old Star Trek.

2:34:37.640 --> 2:34:39.040
 I don't really get the old Star Trek.

2:34:39.040 --> 2:34:41.000
 The special effects aren't good enough.

2:34:41.000 --> 2:34:44.640
 Star Trek, like The Next Generation and Voyager

2:34:44.640 --> 2:34:47.760
 and Deep Space Nine and all those.

2:34:47.760 --> 2:34:52.400
 I think whenever I happen to watch a Star Trek show again,

2:34:52.400 --> 2:34:54.840
 I have a very simple conception in my mind

2:34:54.840 --> 2:34:57.800
 that I really didn't have whenever I saw it way back when.

2:34:57.800 --> 2:35:00.080
 It's that I'm not a fan of Star Trek.

2:35:00.080 --> 2:35:03.240
 It's that this is what the world looks like

2:35:03.240 --> 2:35:06.880
 if technology takes us towards a utopia, right?

2:35:06.880 --> 2:35:08.840
 So I think there's this fascinating thing

2:35:08.840 --> 2:35:11.720
 where technology can take us towards a utopia

2:35:11.720 --> 2:35:13.680
 or towards a dystopia.

2:35:13.680 --> 2:35:18.000
 And in my mind, those kind of three Star Trek shows

2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:23.000
 are a picture of what human civilization looks like

2:35:23.360 --> 2:35:26.120
 if everybody's technological ambitions

2:35:26.120 --> 2:35:28.440
 successfully take us towards a utopia, right?

2:35:28.440 --> 2:35:30.840
 Because in the Star Trek universe,

2:35:30.840 --> 2:35:34.120
 you're not seeking money or you're not seeking safety

2:35:34.120 --> 2:35:38.440
 or you're not really seeking anything for yourself.

2:35:38.440 --> 2:35:41.960
 Everybody within Maslow's hierarchy of needs

2:35:41.960 --> 2:35:43.960
 has gotten so many things for themselves

2:35:43.960 --> 2:35:48.960
 that their goal is learning and discovering and or helping.

2:35:49.600 --> 2:35:53.160
 And I think there is this conception of human life

2:35:53.160 --> 2:35:56.120
 once the baser needs are satisfied.

2:35:56.120 --> 2:35:59.040
 And at the end of the day,

2:35:59.040 --> 2:36:02.560
 I think that's what technology generally can elevate

2:36:02.560 --> 2:36:04.360
 all of human civilization to, right?

2:36:04.360 --> 2:36:07.280
 It can elevate us to Star Trek world

2:36:07.280 --> 2:36:10.360
 where if people want to invent,

2:36:10.360 --> 2:36:11.960
 they can do that all day and nothing else.

2:36:11.960 --> 2:36:13.840
 If people wanna explore the stars,

2:36:13.840 --> 2:36:14.840
 they can explore the stars

2:36:14.840 --> 2:36:18.600
 and they don't have to worry about economic scarcity

2:36:18.600 --> 2:36:21.040
 or any number of these other conceptions.

2:36:21.040 --> 2:36:24.640
 So I don't know what the most impactful on me shows have been

2:36:24.640 --> 2:36:27.600
 but for some reason recently Star Trek

2:36:27.600 --> 2:36:29.880
 in the newer variant,

2:36:29.880 --> 2:36:32.000
 not the most new Star Trek shows.

2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:33.320
 Those shows are a little strange.

2:36:33.320 --> 2:36:35.840
 The kind of middle Star Trek universe

2:36:35.840 --> 2:36:37.840
 where everybody is doing something

2:36:37.840 --> 2:36:40.400
 with like a very important purpose

2:36:40.400 --> 2:36:42.080
 and nobody's thinking about like,

2:36:42.080 --> 2:36:46.200
 where's my paycheck or where's my whatever.

2:36:46.200 --> 2:36:47.040
 They're all kind of like,

2:36:47.040 --> 2:36:50.560
 we have to discover the formula to this

2:36:50.560 --> 2:36:52.440
 to save the planet over there.

2:36:52.440 --> 2:36:54.360
 And literally every episode you're discovering a formula

2:36:54.360 --> 2:36:55.240
 to save a planet, right?

2:36:55.240 --> 2:36:58.480
 Of some kind or a universe or ecosystem or whatever.

2:36:58.480 --> 2:37:00.360
 And you're looking at it, you're like,

2:37:00.360 --> 2:37:02.160
 you know, this is like,

2:37:02.160 --> 2:37:03.560
 this is a pretty good place to end up.

2:37:03.560 --> 2:37:05.280
 This is where we might wanna end up.

2:37:05.280 --> 2:37:06.400
 So it gives you hope.

2:37:06.400 --> 2:37:11.400
 I mean, it's funny that we don't often think about the,

2:37:13.200 --> 2:37:16.880
 I think it's very useful to think about positive visions

2:37:16.880 --> 2:37:20.960
 of the future when we're trying to design technology.

2:37:20.960 --> 2:37:25.080
 There's a lot of sort of in public discourse,

2:37:25.080 --> 2:37:27.040
 a lot of people are thinking about

2:37:27.040 --> 2:37:29.400
 kind of how everything goes wrong.

2:37:29.400 --> 2:37:31.520
 It's important to think about that sometimes,

2:37:31.520 --> 2:37:33.040
 but in moderation, I think,

2:37:33.040 --> 2:37:37.080
 because there's not enough in my little corner

2:37:37.080 --> 2:37:39.000
 of artificial intelligence world,

2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:42.800
 people are very kind of fear monger centered.

2:37:42.800 --> 2:37:44.240
 There's a lot of discussions

2:37:44.240 --> 2:37:46.040
 about how everything goes wrong.

2:37:46.040 --> 2:37:48.920
 Important to do, but it's also really important

2:37:48.920 --> 2:37:53.240
 to talk about how things can go right,

2:37:53.240 --> 2:37:56.000
 because we ultimately want to guide the design

2:37:56.000 --> 2:37:58.880
 of the systems we create to make things right.

2:37:58.880 --> 2:38:02.080
 And I think with hope and optimism,

2:38:02.080 --> 2:38:05.840
 not naiveness, but optimism,

2:38:05.840 --> 2:38:08.240
 you can actually create a better world.

2:38:08.240 --> 2:38:10.600
 Like you have to think about a positive,

2:38:11.560 --> 2:38:14.080
 a better world as you create,

2:38:14.080 --> 2:38:16.080
 because then you can actually create it.

2:38:16.080 --> 2:38:19.920
 Yeah, I'm one of the people that thinks

2:38:19.920 --> 2:38:24.800
 that having an optimistic view of the world

2:38:24.800 --> 2:38:26.840
 is better for design and creativity

2:38:26.840 --> 2:38:28.840
 than having a pessimistic one.

2:38:28.840 --> 2:38:30.920
 It's hard to design when you're in fear.

2:38:33.360 --> 2:38:37.040
 Do you have advice for young people,

2:38:37.040 --> 2:38:38.960
 speaking of being excited about

2:38:38.960 --> 2:38:40.880
 and hopeful about the future world,

2:38:40.880 --> 2:38:43.880
 do you have advice for young people today

2:38:43.880 --> 2:38:46.760
 in computer science world,

2:38:46.760 --> 2:38:48.920
 in software engineering world, in crypto world,

2:38:48.920 --> 2:38:53.680
 but maybe in any world whatsoever for life,

2:38:53.680 --> 2:38:57.040
 how to pick a career or how to live life in general?

2:38:58.080 --> 2:39:02.280
 I think the thing that young people should do

2:39:02.280 --> 2:39:04.160
 is not any one specific thing

2:39:04.160 --> 2:39:07.440
 for any one specific young person.

2:39:07.440 --> 2:39:11.920
 I think what they should do is what they won't be able to do

2:39:11.920 --> 2:39:14.520
 in the later stages of their life.

2:39:14.520 --> 2:39:16.160
 And the way, in my opinion,

2:39:16.160 --> 2:39:19.520
 from a framework point of view to think about that

2:39:19.520 --> 2:39:23.320
 is that the amount of obligations

2:39:23.320 --> 2:39:27.680
 and the amount of time that a person has

2:39:27.680 --> 2:39:30.520
 seems to just diminish over time, right?

2:39:30.520 --> 2:39:32.480
 So the amount of free time they have, right?

2:39:32.480 --> 2:39:33.600
 So you start your job,

2:39:33.600 --> 2:39:35.600
 you get a bunch of responsibilities,

2:39:35.600 --> 2:39:37.240
 something with your partner or spouse,

2:39:37.240 --> 2:39:38.560
 more responsibilities,

2:39:38.560 --> 2:39:40.720
 kids, probably even more responsibilities,

2:39:40.720 --> 2:39:45.640
 and soon enough, the time that you have to educate yourself,

2:39:45.640 --> 2:39:50.080
 to travel, to experience the world however,

2:39:50.080 --> 2:39:53.320
 create whatever creative endeavor you're interested in,

2:39:53.320 --> 2:39:55.800
 slowly but surely disappears.

2:39:55.800 --> 2:39:57.840
 I think this is something

2:39:57.840 --> 2:40:01.280
 that young people don't fully realize.

2:40:01.280 --> 2:40:04.240
 They assume that the world as it is now

2:40:04.240 --> 2:40:08.520
 and the amount of free time that they have to travel,

2:40:08.520 --> 2:40:11.320
 to educate themselves, to make new friends,

2:40:11.320 --> 2:40:12.600
 to do all these things,

2:40:12.600 --> 2:40:16.720
 will somehow maybe diminish by 10%.

2:40:16.720 --> 2:40:20.760
 It won't diminish by 10%, it will diminish by 90%.

2:40:20.760 --> 2:40:22.480
 And the 10% that you have,

2:40:22.480 --> 2:40:27.040
 you'll be resting to get back to work and get things done.

2:40:27.040 --> 2:40:30.160
 So what I think young people should do,

2:40:30.160 --> 2:40:32.600
 and this is why it's very different for each of them, right?

2:40:32.600 --> 2:40:33.720
 I can't tell young people,

2:40:33.720 --> 2:40:36.440
 hey, you should study philosophy, travel,

2:40:36.440 --> 2:40:38.800
 and start your own enterprise to achieve something

2:40:38.800 --> 2:40:39.760
 worthwhile in the world, right?

2:40:39.760 --> 2:40:41.640
 That might be something that's good for me

2:40:41.640 --> 2:40:45.440
 with my values and my kind of worldview,

2:40:45.440 --> 2:40:47.840
 but for other people might be something else.

2:40:47.840 --> 2:40:51.160
 I think the way that they should conceptualize it

2:40:51.160 --> 2:40:56.160
 is imagine if over the next 10, 12 years,

2:40:58.120 --> 2:41:02.200
 the amount of choice that you had about what you could do

2:41:02.200 --> 2:41:05.320
 was cut down by 90%.

2:41:05.320 --> 2:41:07.920
 What would you, and this is copying from this kind of

2:41:07.920 --> 2:41:11.560
 Jeff Bezos regret minimization framework.

2:41:11.560 --> 2:41:12.720
 In that framework, it's like,

2:41:12.720 --> 2:41:16.040
 what would I regret not doing at 80?

2:41:16.040 --> 2:41:19.400
 And that's kind of meant to create this longterm view

2:41:19.400 --> 2:41:22.040
 and make these decisions now that'll get you

2:41:22.040 --> 2:41:24.840
 to a longterm future that you can look back on

2:41:24.840 --> 2:41:26.960
 and be proud of your life, right?

2:41:26.960 --> 2:41:28.840
 What I think young people should do

2:41:28.840 --> 2:41:30.600
 is they should say to themselves,

2:41:30.600 --> 2:41:33.960
 look, if I never get the chance to travel

2:41:33.960 --> 2:41:36.000
 for as long as I live,

2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:40.440
 assuming that after 25, after 27, after 29,

2:41:40.440 --> 2:41:43.400
 that's the case, how will I feel about that?

2:41:43.400 --> 2:41:46.920
 If I never get to start a company after 25,

2:41:46.920 --> 2:41:49.080
 after I get married, after I have kids,

2:41:49.080 --> 2:41:50.960
 how will I feel about that?

2:41:50.960 --> 2:41:53.280
 And whatever they feel the worst about

2:41:53.280 --> 2:41:54.880
 is what they should do.

2:41:54.880 --> 2:41:57.120
 Whatever they feel like when they say to themselves,

2:41:57.120 --> 2:42:01.360
 you know, if I don't travel now, I will never travel.

2:42:01.360 --> 2:42:02.880
 And they feel horrible about that.

2:42:02.880 --> 2:42:05.960
 They just have an overwhelming fear

2:42:05.960 --> 2:42:10.760
 and disgust at themselves in that type of state

2:42:10.760 --> 2:42:14.600
 at 25, 27, 29, that's what they should do.

2:42:14.600 --> 2:42:16.600
 And they shouldn't listen to anybody else.

2:42:19.080 --> 2:42:20.920
 Let me put it to you this way.

2:42:20.920 --> 2:42:24.560
 If you're really smart, you're gonna make it anyway.

2:42:24.560 --> 2:42:26.360
 There's a lot of people putting a lot of pressure on you

2:42:26.360 --> 2:42:28.560
 because they're afraid whether you're gonna make it.

2:42:28.560 --> 2:42:31.280
 If you're really smart, you're gonna make it anyway.

2:42:31.280 --> 2:42:33.600
 If you're not really smart, you're screwed anyway.

2:42:33.600 --> 2:42:36.120
 So at the end of the day.

2:42:36.120 --> 2:42:39.000
 Either way, just relax with it and use your time well

2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:43.080
 to do the things you would most regret not doing.

2:42:43.080 --> 2:42:44.720
 That's really fascinating.

2:42:44.720 --> 2:42:46.120
 I wouldn't say relax.

2:42:46.120 --> 2:42:50.360
 I would say very much cherish the free time,

2:42:50.360 --> 2:42:52.640
 the discretionary time that you have

2:42:52.640 --> 2:42:56.360
 from the age of 18 to maybe 25.

2:42:56.360 --> 2:42:59.760
 Because at 25, everyone's gonna start looking at each other

2:42:59.760 --> 2:43:02.040
 and asking, what have I achieved?

2:43:02.040 --> 2:43:04.520
 Like my friends have achieved, I haven't achieved.

2:43:04.520 --> 2:43:06.200
 And then by the time you get to 30,

2:43:06.200 --> 2:43:07.960
 you're gonna look at each other again and go,

2:43:07.960 --> 2:43:11.360
 well, my friends have a family or a company

2:43:11.360 --> 2:43:14.480
 or a PhD or a whatever, what do I have?

2:43:14.480 --> 2:43:16.040
 And the pressure will just increase.

2:43:16.040 --> 2:43:20.040
 And it'll increase so much that even if you want to go

2:43:20.040 --> 2:43:22.760
 and do the fun thing, it will not be fun.

2:43:22.760 --> 2:43:26.080
 Because the pressure of comparing yourself

2:43:26.080 --> 2:43:29.240
 to your friends at 25 or your peers at 30

2:43:29.240 --> 2:43:33.560
 will be so great that it will no longer be normal

2:43:33.560 --> 2:43:36.440
 for you to be in a hostel at 30,

2:43:36.440 --> 2:43:38.280
 kind of like living it up.

2:43:40.480 --> 2:43:42.400
 And this is why I also can't tell you

2:43:42.400 --> 2:43:43.360
 specifically what it is.

2:43:43.360 --> 2:43:46.000
 For me, it was getting an education in philosophy

2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:47.760
 that was rigorous and in depth.

2:43:47.760 --> 2:43:50.280
 It was traveling and it was starting an enterprise

2:43:50.280 --> 2:43:52.640
 that I thought that was worthwhile, that I directed,

2:43:52.640 --> 2:43:54.320
 that I could make into something great.

2:43:54.320 --> 2:43:55.600
 That's what it was for me.

2:43:55.600 --> 2:43:58.040
 For other people, it might be something with a band,

2:43:58.040 --> 2:43:59.880
 it might be something with painting,

2:43:59.880 --> 2:44:02.280
 it might be an education.

2:44:02.280 --> 2:44:04.760
 You, by the way, also should not assume

2:44:04.760 --> 2:44:09.760
 that your ability to get an education will improve.

2:44:09.840 --> 2:44:13.200
 All of those responsibilities will take away

2:44:13.200 --> 2:44:15.480
 your ability to get an education.

2:44:15.480 --> 2:44:17.480
 So if you value having an education,

2:44:17.480 --> 2:44:22.000
 if you value being a deeply educated, well rounded person

2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:25.320
 with a wide array of knowledge on a wide array of topics,

2:44:25.320 --> 2:44:27.920
 capitalism will force you to specialize.

2:44:27.920 --> 2:44:29.720
 That's what it's good at, it's gonna take you,

2:44:29.720 --> 2:44:32.920
 it's gonna fashion you into a very specific tool

2:44:32.920 --> 2:44:36.880
 for a very, most people, into a very specific set of tasks.

2:44:36.880 --> 2:44:40.600
 If you want to have an education in something, get it now.

2:44:40.600 --> 2:44:43.120
 If you wanna travel somewhere, travel there now.

2:44:43.120 --> 2:44:45.360
 If you wanna do some kind of creative endeavor

2:44:45.360 --> 2:44:48.640
 that you doubt whether you'll have time for in the future,

2:44:48.640 --> 2:44:49.480
 do it now.

2:44:49.480 --> 2:44:51.320
 You won't have time for it in the future,

2:44:51.320 --> 2:44:54.560
 you won't have time to read philosophy books all day,

2:44:54.560 --> 2:44:59.560
 unfortunately, you won't have time to fly to Italy

2:44:59.560 --> 2:45:02.080
 and kind of hang out with people.

2:45:02.080 --> 2:45:04.040
 If you're serious about your life,

2:45:04.040 --> 2:45:05.440
 you're gonna get more responsibilities,

2:45:05.440 --> 2:45:07.360
 you're gonna get more stuff to do.

2:45:07.360 --> 2:45:10.920
 And so my advice to you is do not piss away

2:45:10.920 --> 2:45:14.480
 this rare, unique, discretionary time.

2:45:14.480 --> 2:45:18.080
 And if your friends are, get new friends.

2:45:18.080 --> 2:45:21.480
 Get smarter friends, get people who are using

2:45:21.480 --> 2:45:23.160
 the limited time they have better.

2:45:23.160 --> 2:45:25.920
 That's my advice.

2:45:25.920 --> 2:45:29.240
 So it's just a quickly comment, it's brilliant.

2:45:29.240 --> 2:45:31.480
 You know, to reframe high school

2:45:31.480 --> 2:45:34.120
 and undergraduate college education,

2:45:34.120 --> 2:45:37.400
 sometimes people wanna quickly get it over with.

2:45:37.400 --> 2:45:42.400
 But one thing I remember thinking,

2:45:42.640 --> 2:45:45.440
 and it's very true about high school,

2:45:45.440 --> 2:45:48.120
 is one of the only times in your life

2:45:48.120 --> 2:45:51.280
 you'll get a chance to truly get a broad education.

2:45:51.280 --> 2:45:53.840
 You don't often think of it that way,

2:45:53.840 --> 2:45:57.160
 but it's a chance to really enjoy learning things

2:45:57.160 --> 2:45:58.720
 that are outside of the specialty

2:45:58.720 --> 2:46:00.480
 that you'll eventually end up with.

2:46:00.480 --> 2:46:02.280
 And that's how college education is.

2:46:02.280 --> 2:46:05.640
 And on a more fun side, I played music,

2:46:05.640 --> 2:46:09.360
 I did martial arts, and we offline mentioned

2:46:09.360 --> 2:46:10.720
 played video games.

2:46:10.720 --> 2:46:14.120
 I find it fascinating and brilliant what you said,

2:46:14.120 --> 2:46:17.400
 which is the world will not give you a chance

2:46:17.400 --> 2:46:19.760
 to truly enjoy many of these things

2:46:19.760 --> 2:46:22.720
 and truly get value from many of those things

2:46:23.600 --> 2:46:25.560
 once you get older.

2:46:25.560 --> 2:46:29.440
 I find it exceptionally difficult to enjoy video games now.

2:46:29.440 --> 2:46:30.280
 There's so much stuff to do,

2:46:30.280 --> 2:46:31.800
 there's so much responsibility.

2:46:32.960 --> 2:46:37.280
 And I, at the time when I played Elder Scrolls

2:46:37.280 --> 2:46:39.920
 and Baldur's Gate and Diablo II,

2:46:39.920 --> 2:46:44.440
 and at the time I thought maybe that was a waste of time.

2:46:45.880 --> 2:46:49.080
 But now looking back, I realize,

2:46:49.080 --> 2:46:50.520
 because I always thought,

2:46:50.520 --> 2:46:52.120
 let me get the career first

2:46:52.120 --> 2:46:54.080
 and then I'll have a chance to play video games.

2:46:54.080 --> 2:46:55.880
 That's the way I was thinking.

2:46:55.880 --> 2:46:57.080
 It was a waste of time

2:46:57.080 --> 2:47:01.120
 because I should really progress on the career

2:47:01.120 --> 2:47:03.160
 and then I'll have time to play video games.

2:47:03.160 --> 2:47:06.160
 No, the reality is that was really fulfilling.

2:47:06.160 --> 2:47:10.560
 Those are some of the happiest travel experiences

2:47:10.560 --> 2:47:14.040
 of my life is me traveling to those virtual worlds

2:47:14.040 --> 2:47:15.680
 and spending time in them.

2:47:15.680 --> 2:47:16.880
 And it was really fulfilling

2:47:16.880 --> 2:47:19.160
 and they stayed with me for the rest of my life.

2:47:19.160 --> 2:47:21.880
 And I get to experience echoes of that

2:47:21.880 --> 2:47:23.440
 when I play video games these days

2:47:23.440 --> 2:47:25.280
 for an hour here, an hour there,

2:47:25.280 --> 2:47:27.840
 like one hour a month or something like that.

2:47:27.840 --> 2:47:30.960
 But even those experiences, as silly as they are,

2:47:30.960 --> 2:47:33.440
 they seem like a waste of time at the time,

2:47:33.440 --> 2:47:37.040
 enjoying them fully, unapologetically.

2:47:37.040 --> 2:47:41.160
 And in a framework exactly as you said,

2:47:41.160 --> 2:47:43.800
 would I regret being the kind of person

2:47:43.800 --> 2:47:46.560
 who've never played those video games?

2:47:46.560 --> 2:47:50.120
 And I can, for myself, honestly say that yes.

2:47:50.120 --> 2:47:52.280
 Look, when I'm on my death bed,

2:47:53.480 --> 2:47:57.400
 I'm glad I built Baldur's Gate 2

2:47:57.400 --> 2:48:00.960
 and all those arena, Daggerfall, Morrowind

2:48:00.960 --> 2:48:03.600
 and all the Elder Scrolls games.

2:48:03.600 --> 2:48:08.600
 And yeah, the things that don't necessarily fit

2:48:10.440 --> 2:48:12.280
 into this kind of storyline

2:48:12.280 --> 2:48:14.480
 of what a career is supposed to be,

2:48:14.480 --> 2:48:16.480
 travel and all those experiences that you mentioned.

2:48:16.480 --> 2:48:20.000
 I think I'd just like to say one final quick thing on this.

2:48:21.560 --> 2:48:24.000
 I think this extends to really hard things as well.

2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:25.800
 It extends to the things you wanna do,

2:48:25.800 --> 2:48:27.360
 but one of the best pieces of advice

2:48:27.360 --> 2:48:31.720
 one of my mentors gave me early on in my career

2:48:31.720 --> 2:48:35.400
 around this time is that it will actually become harder

2:48:35.400 --> 2:48:38.760
 to start a company as you get older.

2:48:38.760 --> 2:48:41.360
 Once again, because you have more responsibilities,

2:48:41.360 --> 2:48:44.560
 you're responsible to your partner for some kind of income

2:48:44.560 --> 2:48:45.720
 to create a life together.

2:48:45.720 --> 2:48:47.160
 Once you have kids, you're responsible

2:48:47.160 --> 2:48:50.320
 for an even greater income to create a life for kids.

2:48:50.320 --> 2:48:53.280
 And startups do not generate income, right?

2:48:53.280 --> 2:48:56.040
 They take many, many years before anything happens.

2:48:56.040 --> 2:48:59.160
 People are getting evicted, people are eating ramen noodles.

2:48:59.160 --> 2:49:02.160
 That is a thing, that happens, that will happen.

2:49:02.160 --> 2:49:05.920
 So I'm not saying that you should do the fun things

2:49:05.920 --> 2:49:07.360
 or the enjoyable things.

2:49:07.360 --> 2:49:12.200
 I'm saying the things that you would regret not doing,

2:49:12.200 --> 2:49:17.200
 that you can uniquely do in the time span from 18 to 25.

2:49:18.080 --> 2:49:22.360
 Which one of which is, if you plan to have a family

2:49:22.360 --> 2:49:24.680
 and start a family when you're 25,

2:49:24.680 --> 2:49:26.840
 you should start a company now.

2:49:26.840 --> 2:49:29.440
 You should not wait until a bunch of people depend on you

2:49:29.440 --> 2:49:32.120
 for income to eat, to start a company.

2:49:32.120 --> 2:49:34.720
 The amount of pressure that will be on you at that point

2:49:34.720 --> 2:49:36.480
 will be monumental.

2:49:36.480 --> 2:49:39.200
 You should start a company when nobody depends on you

2:49:39.200 --> 2:49:42.680
 and you can sleep on the floor eating ramen noodles

2:49:42.680 --> 2:49:45.040
 and still have a great time and show up

2:49:45.040 --> 2:49:47.720
 with a lot of enthusiasm and be excited.

2:49:47.720 --> 2:49:52.720
 So I just mean whatever you want to really devote yourself

2:49:52.760 --> 2:49:56.200
 to and really do, don't put it off.

2:49:56.200 --> 2:49:59.080
 Don't go to consulting or banking or any other industry

2:49:59.080 --> 2:50:00.600
 and say, I'm gonna do this for three years

2:50:00.600 --> 2:50:02.080
 and I'll get experience.

2:50:02.080 --> 2:50:04.680
 The only way you get experience is by doing something.

2:50:04.680 --> 2:50:07.440
 You go, you do it, you fail, you do it again and again

2:50:07.440 --> 2:50:09.680
 and again and again and again and then you have experience

2:50:09.680 --> 2:50:10.720
 and then you can do it right.

2:50:10.720 --> 2:50:12.360
 That's the only way experience happens.

2:50:12.360 --> 2:50:14.720
 There is no other way short of mentorship.

2:50:14.720 --> 2:50:16.240
 If you're lucky to get mentorship,

2:50:16.240 --> 2:50:18.760
 99% of people don't get mentorship.

2:50:18.760 --> 2:50:20.640
 And even though we're talking about young people,

2:50:20.640 --> 2:50:23.720
 I feel like you're speaking to me as somebody who spent

2:50:23.720 --> 2:50:25.720
 the last two weeks sleeping on the floor

2:50:25.720 --> 2:50:28.400
 because there's no mattress and somebody who is single

2:50:28.400 --> 2:50:30.840
 and somebody who's thinking about doing a startup,

2:50:30.840 --> 2:50:34.760
 I felt like you're speaking to me as a fellow young person.

2:50:34.760 --> 2:50:39.760
 Let me ask you about this whole life of ours

2:50:41.040 --> 2:50:43.160
 to zoom out on the big philosophical question,

2:50:43.160 --> 2:50:44.520
 the ridiculous question.

2:50:44.520 --> 2:50:46.680
 What do you think is the meaning of it all?

2:50:47.960 --> 2:50:49.320
 Do you think about this kind of stuff

2:50:49.320 --> 2:50:51.920
 as you're creating all the technology,

2:50:51.920 --> 2:50:54.520
 as you're thinking about this future?

2:50:54.520 --> 2:50:57.160
 You ever zoom out and think like, why?

2:50:57.160 --> 2:50:59.880
 Why are you surrogate striving?

2:50:59.880 --> 2:51:04.880
 Why are we the human species striving for the stars?

2:51:05.040 --> 2:51:08.880
 So I think it comes down to whether people

2:51:08.880 --> 2:51:10.240
 wanna live in society.

2:51:11.200 --> 2:51:14.960
 So if people decide to be part of society,

2:51:14.960 --> 2:51:19.960
 they have a certain set of conditions

2:51:20.040 --> 2:51:23.240
 that they decide to take part in, right?

2:51:23.240 --> 2:51:27.640
 So I think what this comes down to is a lot of

2:51:27.640 --> 2:51:30.280
 really involved conversations.

2:51:30.280 --> 2:51:33.000
 But if we assume people have free will and choice,

2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:36.120
 if we just kind of make that blanket assumption,

2:51:36.120 --> 2:51:37.600
 then the question starts to become,

2:51:37.600 --> 2:51:39.200
 well, what choices do we make?

2:51:39.200 --> 2:51:41.880
 And how do we live with those choices?

2:51:41.880 --> 2:51:44.640
 And I think probably the most fundamental choice

2:51:44.640 --> 2:51:47.560
 is whether we exist in a society

2:51:47.560 --> 2:51:49.840
 or we choose to leave society.

2:51:49.840 --> 2:51:50.880
 And there are people that do this.

2:51:50.880 --> 2:51:52.000
 There are people that go live in the woods.

2:51:52.000 --> 2:51:55.080
 There are people that immigrate to other societies

2:51:55.080 --> 2:51:56.880
 and they make a choice, right?

2:51:56.880 --> 2:51:58.840
 And as they enter those other societies

2:51:58.840 --> 2:52:01.840
 or they choose to leave society and go live in the woods,

2:52:01.840 --> 2:52:05.960
 they adopt a certain set of values, right?

2:52:05.960 --> 2:52:08.400
 They adopt values that the society prescribes,

2:52:08.400 --> 2:52:09.680
 they compromise their own values,

2:52:09.680 --> 2:52:11.000
 they define their own values,

2:52:11.000 --> 2:52:13.760
 and they create a set of values for themselves, right?

2:52:14.760 --> 2:52:18.080
 I think at the end of the day,

2:52:18.080 --> 2:52:21.000
 if you're going to choose to live in society,

2:52:22.040 --> 2:52:25.600
 in addition to all the minimums of not throwing garbage

2:52:25.600 --> 2:52:28.920
 on the floor and doing nice things for people

2:52:28.920 --> 2:52:31.520
 that need help and doing any number of things

2:52:31.520 --> 2:52:34.640
 to just be a normal human being within society,

2:52:34.640 --> 2:52:37.120
 you have to ask yourself,

2:52:37.120 --> 2:52:39.880
 what am I doing as part of society, right?

2:52:39.880 --> 2:52:42.640
 You can always say, hey, I'm going to leave society.

2:52:42.640 --> 2:52:43.680
 I'm going to live in the woods.

2:52:43.680 --> 2:52:44.720
 I did that, right?

2:52:44.720 --> 2:52:46.960
 I went and I lived in the woods and I gave it a shot,

2:52:46.960 --> 2:52:49.760
 realized a ton of stuff, huge amount of clarity from that.

2:52:49.760 --> 2:52:52.760
 But when you decide to live in society,

2:52:52.760 --> 2:52:57.480
 you take on, first of all, certain minimal agreements.

2:52:57.480 --> 2:53:01.040
 You mold your values a little bit to that society.

2:53:01.040 --> 2:53:03.960
 That's another choice that people inherently make.

2:53:03.960 --> 2:53:07.120
 And then there's a question of,

2:53:07.120 --> 2:53:08.920
 well, what am I doing here, right?

2:53:08.920 --> 2:53:11.000
 What am I doing in society, right?

2:53:11.000 --> 2:53:12.960
 So when people say the meaning of life,

2:53:12.960 --> 2:53:14.440
 I don't know what the meaning of life is.

2:53:14.440 --> 2:53:16.480
 It's the meaning of life in society.

2:53:16.480 --> 2:53:18.400
 Right, what's the meaning of life for the choice

2:53:18.400 --> 2:53:20.480
 that you've made within society, right?

2:53:20.480 --> 2:53:22.640
 Because that's maybe the first fundamental choice

2:53:22.640 --> 2:53:23.280
 you made.

2:53:23.280 --> 2:53:24.560
 You made a choice and you continue

2:53:24.560 --> 2:53:27.280
 to make a choice to be part of society

2:53:27.280 --> 2:53:30.600
 and a specific society, right?

2:53:30.600 --> 2:53:32.280
 So you've made this choice.

2:53:32.280 --> 2:53:34.120
 You're part of a society.

2:53:34.120 --> 2:53:41.880
 And now you kind of have a life and you have people around you.

2:53:41.880 --> 2:53:44.640
 And then the question is, in my opinion,

2:53:44.640 --> 2:53:46.800
 the question is, what is the body of work

2:53:46.800 --> 2:53:50.120
 that you want to make, right?

2:53:50.120 --> 2:53:55.040
 I think, personally, that life is kind of so short.

2:53:55.040 --> 2:53:57.760
 And the ability to get enough resources for yourself

2:53:57.760 --> 2:53:59.440
 in at least the developed markets

2:53:59.440 --> 2:54:03.600
 where we're lucky to be in is so relatively abundant

2:54:03.600 --> 2:54:08.200
 that we, you and me, have the luxury,

2:54:08.200 --> 2:54:10.960
 by your pursuit of a PhD, you've had this luxury,

2:54:10.960 --> 2:54:13.360
 I've had this luxury through the work

2:54:13.360 --> 2:54:16.760
 that I've been doing, to pursue something

2:54:16.760 --> 2:54:19.800
 that makes society better.

2:54:19.800 --> 2:54:25.000
 So this is kind of the question, I would say.

2:54:25.000 --> 2:54:28.280
 The question is, am I going to live in society, yes or no?

2:54:28.280 --> 2:54:28.960
 Yes, OK.

2:54:28.960 --> 2:54:30.120
 Most people choose yes.

2:54:30.120 --> 2:54:31.600
 I understand why, to a degree.

2:54:31.600 --> 2:54:33.400
 I understand why some people choose no.

2:54:33.400 --> 2:54:35.440
 And then what is the but?

2:54:35.440 --> 2:54:37.040
 And I'm going to be in society.

2:54:37.040 --> 2:54:38.440
 If you choose to be in society, you're

2:54:38.440 --> 2:54:40.200
 just choosing to abide by the rules.

2:54:40.200 --> 2:54:42.600
 You're choosing to just do the minimum, right?

2:54:42.600 --> 2:54:44.360
 That's what being part of society means.

2:54:44.360 --> 2:54:45.840
 People that choose to be part of society

2:54:45.840 --> 2:54:47.920
 but don't want to do this, it's very confusing.

2:54:47.920 --> 2:54:48.840
 They should just leave.

2:54:48.840 --> 2:54:51.200
 They should just go, look, I don't like this deal.

2:54:51.200 --> 2:54:52.600
 I'm going to go somewhere else.

2:54:52.600 --> 2:54:53.640
 I'm going to live in Tibet.

2:54:53.640 --> 2:54:55.120
 I'm going to live in the woods.

2:54:55.120 --> 2:55:00.000
 I'm going to live wherever the rules are to my liking, right?

2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:02.240
 You've chosen to be in society.

2:55:02.240 --> 2:55:04.120
 Next question, kind of final question,

2:55:04.120 --> 2:55:07.280
 is what is the body of work that I'm going to be involved in?

2:55:07.280 --> 2:55:10.200
 Because in looking at that Jeff Bezos kind of regret

2:55:10.200 --> 2:55:12.400
 minimization framework thing, I think

2:55:12.400 --> 2:55:14.280
 that's what a lot of it really comes down to,

2:55:14.280 --> 2:55:16.800
 is you kind of, the framework is at 80 years old,

2:55:16.800 --> 2:55:18.800
 you look back over your life, what would you

2:55:18.800 --> 2:55:19.840
 regret not doing?

2:55:19.840 --> 2:55:23.360
 What would you regret not pursuing?

2:55:23.360 --> 2:55:26.000
 I think there are a number of things on a personal level

2:55:26.000 --> 2:55:29.800
 each person has, but I think, at least for me,

2:55:29.800 --> 2:55:32.720
 and probably for many of the other people I know,

2:55:32.720 --> 2:55:35.800
 there's a question of what is the body of work

2:55:35.800 --> 2:55:37.280
 that I was involved in?

2:55:37.280 --> 2:55:38.680
 What did I do?

2:55:38.680 --> 2:55:40.160
 What happened, right?

2:55:40.160 --> 2:55:42.760
 What was I involved in?

2:55:42.760 --> 2:55:47.840
 And in my opinion, you should have a good answer to that.

2:55:47.840 --> 2:55:50.120
 You mentioned the body of work in relation

2:55:50.120 --> 2:55:54.760
 to whether it helped make a better world.

2:55:54.760 --> 2:55:58.280
 And the fundamental question there is,

2:55:58.280 --> 2:56:00.120
 what does better mean?

2:56:00.120 --> 2:56:03.920
 So it's our striving to understand what is better.

2:56:03.920 --> 2:56:08.920
 What kind of world would we love to exist after we're gone?

2:56:09.400 --> 2:56:12.040
 And I think that's another thing,

2:56:12.040 --> 2:56:13.600
 almost unanswerable question,

2:56:13.600 --> 2:56:16.440
 but it's one we can strive towards,

2:56:16.440 --> 2:56:18.280
 is what is a better world?

2:56:19.960 --> 2:56:22.560
 Right, I think that's once again,

2:56:22.560 --> 2:56:23.800
 that's a very personal question.

2:56:23.800 --> 2:56:26.240
 I'm not sure if there's an objective moral truth

2:56:26.240 --> 2:56:28.440
 that's gonna suddenly give us all an answer.

2:56:28.440 --> 2:56:30.520
 I think it's actually quite fascinating to me

2:56:30.520 --> 2:56:32.600
 when people feel they have this objective moral truth,

2:56:32.600 --> 2:56:34.600
 they're so sure in their opinions,

2:56:34.600 --> 2:56:37.800
 this is what we do, we should go hurt them or help them

2:56:37.800 --> 2:56:41.080
 or kill them or rescue them or whatever, right?

2:56:41.080 --> 2:56:44.320
 There's all these kind of very situational specific

2:56:44.320 --> 2:56:46.560
 kind of like, this is the right thing to do,

2:56:46.560 --> 2:56:49.960
 the objective moral truth told me that this is it.

2:56:49.960 --> 2:56:51.960
 But maybe there's a definitive truth

2:56:51.960 --> 2:56:56.360
 that we can arrive towards sort of a consensus

2:56:56.360 --> 2:56:59.640
 of what that is within the little local pocket

2:56:59.640 --> 2:57:01.400
 of society that you're in.

2:57:01.400 --> 2:57:02.240
 Yeah, that's the point.

2:57:02.240 --> 2:57:03.080
 That's what happens.

2:57:03.080 --> 2:57:04.360
 People just then mislabel it

2:57:04.360 --> 2:57:06.520
 and they go like objective moral truth.

2:57:06.520 --> 2:57:09.280
 This is not our idea.

2:57:09.280 --> 2:57:10.760
 This is coming up from on high here.

2:57:10.760 --> 2:57:15.240
 This is the objective moral truth that,

2:57:15.240 --> 2:57:18.640
 I think exists in some metaphysical form somewhere.

2:57:18.640 --> 2:57:21.160
 And then you build a building with marble and it's big

2:57:21.160 --> 2:57:22.840
 and usually what happens.

2:57:22.840 --> 2:57:23.920
 And then you convince yourself

2:57:23.920 --> 2:57:24.760
 that that building represents.

2:57:24.760 --> 2:57:26.440
 I think those people actually,

2:57:26.440 --> 2:57:27.920
 the people who build those buildings

2:57:27.920 --> 2:57:30.280
 probably understand that there is no metaphysical objective.

2:57:30.280 --> 2:57:32.640
 They're just like, we're all just coming to consensus.

2:57:32.640 --> 2:57:34.280
 I'm gonna build the biggest building and you're like me

2:57:34.280 --> 2:57:35.800
 and that's what we're gonna do, right?

2:57:35.800 --> 2:57:37.960
 They just look at it that way probably.

2:57:37.960 --> 2:57:42.960
 I think what ends up happening with all these values is,

2:57:43.240 --> 2:57:45.000
 yeah, people should determine that for themselves.

2:57:45.000 --> 2:57:47.200
 I agree that there's a second order question here

2:57:47.200 --> 2:57:50.200
 of what is the best body of work to work on.

2:57:51.480 --> 2:57:53.480
 Personally, I think that's probably a mix

2:57:53.480 --> 2:57:56.000
 of what could you realistically achieve?

2:57:57.280 --> 2:57:59.040
 Is that gonna have an impact on society

2:57:59.040 --> 2:58:00.160
 that you feel good about?

2:58:00.160 --> 2:58:01.480
 Yeah. Right?

2:58:01.480 --> 2:58:04.680
 So these are probably the two aspects of this question

2:58:04.680 --> 2:58:07.080
 and is this gonna have a good impact on society

2:58:07.080 --> 2:58:08.120
 that you feel good about?

2:58:08.120 --> 2:58:09.760
 Obviously very subjective, right?

2:58:09.760 --> 2:58:13.200
 Some people save animals, some people save forests.

2:58:13.200 --> 2:58:17.640
 We and I are creating this system of economic fairness

2:58:17.640 --> 2:58:19.120
 and transparency.

2:58:19.120 --> 2:58:22.920
 I feel that I'm in a good position to enable that.

2:58:22.920 --> 2:58:25.680
 I feel that I have a good chance of succeeding at that.

2:58:25.680 --> 2:58:29.080
 And I think that the impact will be quite meaningful

2:58:29.080 --> 2:58:30.720
 for a large number of people.

2:58:30.720 --> 2:58:34.120
 And so I'm completely happy to look back

2:58:34.120 --> 2:58:37.360
 once I made it and see a body of work that achieved that

2:58:37.360 --> 2:58:38.520
 and be very proud of that, right?

2:58:38.520 --> 2:58:40.440
 Because I think that's what I'll be doing

2:58:40.440 --> 2:58:42.120
 when I'm looking back.

2:58:42.120 --> 2:58:43.040
 Well, I agree with you.

2:58:43.040 --> 2:58:48.040
 The scale of impact as a hybrid smart contracts,

2:58:48.400 --> 2:58:50.760
 this whole idea that you're working on

2:58:50.760 --> 2:58:55.360
 has a potential to transform the world for the better

2:58:55.360 --> 2:59:00.360
 at a scale that I can't even imagine.

2:59:00.800 --> 2:59:03.720
 So speaking of which means even more

2:59:03.720 --> 2:59:05.880
 that you would waste so many hours

2:59:05.880 --> 2:59:07.520
 of that exciting life with me.

2:59:07.520 --> 2:59:09.160
 Thank you so much for talking to me, Sergei.

2:59:09.160 --> 2:59:11.320
 This is a really fascinating conversation,

2:59:11.320 --> 2:59:14.680
 a really fascinating space, and I can't wait to learn more.

2:59:14.680 --> 2:59:17.040
 So thank you so much for talking today.

2:59:17.040 --> 2:59:17.880
 Thank you for having me.

2:59:17.880 --> 2:59:19.980
 It's been an absolute pleasure.

2:59:19.980 --> 2:59:21.560
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:59:21.560 --> 2:59:22.880
 with Sergei Nazarov.

2:59:22.880 --> 2:59:27.520
 And thank you to Wine Access, Athletic Greens, Magic Spoon,

2:59:27.520 --> 2:59:29.800
 Indeed, and BetterHelp.

2:59:29.800 --> 2:59:33.520
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

2:59:33.520 --> 2:59:37.080
 And now let me leave you with some words from Copernicus.

2:59:37.080 --> 2:59:39.560
 To know that we know what we know

2:59:39.560 --> 2:59:43.160
 and to know that we do not know what we do not know,

2:59:43.160 --> 2:59:45.640
 that is true knowledge.

2:59:45.640 --> 3:00:04.640
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
