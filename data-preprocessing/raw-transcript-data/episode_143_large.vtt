00:00.000 --> 00:02.520
 The following is a conversation with John Clark.

00:02.520 --> 00:05.640
 He's a friend, a Brazilian jiu jitsu black belt,

00:05.640 --> 00:08.980
 former MMA fighter, and at least in my opinion,

00:08.980 --> 00:12.300
 one of the great UFC corner man coaches to listen to.

00:12.300 --> 00:15.200
 And also, he's my current jiu jitsu coach

00:15.200 --> 00:17.600
 at Broadway Jiu Jitsu in South Boston.

00:17.600 --> 00:22.160
 He was once, for a time, a philosophy major in college,

00:22.160 --> 00:26.320
 and is now, I would say, a kind of practicing philosopher,

00:26.320 --> 00:28.360
 opinionated, brilliant,

00:28.360 --> 00:31.720
 and someone I always enjoy talking to even when,

00:31.720 --> 00:36.040
 especially when, we disagree, which we do often.

00:36.040 --> 00:38.040
 He's definitely someone I can see talking to

00:38.040 --> 00:39.960
 many times on this podcast.

00:39.960 --> 00:43.280
 In fact, he hosts a new podcast of his own

00:43.280 --> 00:45.680
 called Please Allow Me.

00:46.760 --> 00:48.440
 Quick mention of each sponsor,

00:48.440 --> 00:50.880
 followed by some thoughts related to the episode.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.920
 Thank you to Theragun,

00:52.920 --> 00:56.080
 the device I use for post workout muscle recovery,

00:56.080 --> 00:58.800
 Magic Spoon, low carb keto friendly cereal

00:58.800 --> 01:00.720
 that I think is delicious,

01:00.720 --> 01:03.320
 Eight Sleep, a mattress that cools itself

01:03.320 --> 01:06.120
 and gives me yet another reason to enjoy sleep,

01:06.120 --> 01:09.880
 and Cash App, the app I use to send money to friends.

01:09.880 --> 01:12.480
 Please check out these sponsors in the description

01:12.480 --> 01:15.640
 to get a discount and to support this podcast.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.240
 As a side note, let me say that martial arts,

01:18.240 --> 01:20.120
 especially jiu jitsu and judo,

01:20.120 --> 01:22.960
 have been a big part of my growth as a human being.

01:22.960 --> 01:25.360
 So I think I will talk to a few martial artists

01:25.360 --> 01:27.280
 on occasion on this podcast.

01:27.280 --> 01:29.520
 I hope that is of interest to you.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.920
 I won't talk to people who are simply great fighters

01:31.920 --> 01:35.040
 or great athletes, but people who have a philosophy

01:35.040 --> 01:37.640
 that I find to be interesting and worth exploring,

01:37.640 --> 01:41.520
 even if I disagree with parts or most of it.

01:41.520 --> 01:43.440
 I like alternating between historians

01:43.440 --> 01:46.440
 and computer scientists, fighters and biologists,

01:46.440 --> 01:50.000
 and between totally different worldviews and personalities,

01:50.000 --> 01:53.360
 like Elon Musk and Michael Malice.

01:53.360 --> 01:56.320
 This world, to me, is fascinating

01:56.320 --> 01:58.800
 because of the diversity of weirdness

01:58.800 --> 02:00.920
 that is human civilization.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.400
 I love the weird and the brilliant,

02:03.400 --> 02:06.600
 and hope you join me on the journey of exploring both.

02:06.600 --> 02:09.360
 If you don't like an episode, skip it.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.360
 For an OCD person like myself,

02:11.360 --> 02:14.160
 sometimes not listening to a podcast episode

02:14.160 --> 02:16.040
 is an act of courage.

02:16.040 --> 02:19.640
 It's like not finishing a book even though you're 80% done.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.200
 Try it sometimes.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.360
 Listen to ones you like, and don't listen

02:23.360 --> 02:25.000
 to the ones you don't like.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.920
 I know, it's profound advice.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.360

02:38.840 --> 02:42.760
 And now, here's my conversation with John Clark.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.240
 You ready for this?

02:45.240 --> 02:46.720
 I've been ready for this my whole life.

02:46.720 --> 02:50.040
 All right, I was thinking of doing a Kerouac style road trip

02:50.040 --> 02:51.520
 across the United States,

02:52.560 --> 02:54.920
 after this whole COVID thing lifts.

02:54.920 --> 02:56.840
 You ever take a trip like that?

02:56.840 --> 02:59.840
 I've done a handful of long distance driving trips

03:01.320 --> 03:04.840
 up and down the East Coast, but also from the West Coast

03:04.840 --> 03:08.600
 back to the East Coast, and then returning to California.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.440
 So I've definitely done my fair share

03:10.440 --> 03:12.600
 of driving in this country.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.480
 Do you have the longing for the great American road trip?

03:16.360 --> 03:18.400
 I think there are so many things

03:18.400 --> 03:20.560
 that I've been lucky enough to see in the world

03:20.560 --> 03:22.720
 that I now, at this point in my life, realize

03:22.720 --> 03:25.440
 there are tons of things that I need to see here

03:25.440 --> 03:27.680
 in this country, and a road trip could potentially

03:27.680 --> 03:29.680
 be the best way to see them.

03:30.760 --> 03:34.160
 I think to do it effectively, you need an amount of time

03:34.160 --> 03:36.560
 where you can be as leisurely as possible.

03:36.560 --> 03:38.480
 There's no deadline, and there's no,

03:38.480 --> 03:41.480
 I've gotta make it from Chicago to St. Louis by sundown

03:41.480 --> 03:43.520
 to get to this place at this time.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.960
 I think you really need to be able to take your time

03:45.960 --> 03:50.960
 and kind of let the road take you where you need to go.

03:51.280 --> 03:54.160
 It feels like you need a mission though, ultimately.

03:54.160 --> 03:56.080
 There's a reason you need to be in San Francisco.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.720
 That's like the Kerouac thing.

03:57.720 --> 04:00.120
 You have to meet somebody somewhere kind of loosely

04:00.120 --> 04:03.280
 in a few weeks, and then it's the,

04:03.280 --> 04:06.440
 as you struggle on towards that mission,

04:06.440 --> 04:08.480
 you meet weird characters that get in your way,

04:08.480 --> 04:11.480
 but ultimately sort of create an experience.

04:11.480 --> 04:13.560
 I think having a loose deadline is good,

04:13.560 --> 04:16.080
 but that's a beginning and an end point,

04:16.080 --> 04:18.520
 and what I mean is I don't wanna have to be,

04:18.520 --> 04:22.280
 all right, we're leaving, say, Boston on Sunday night.

04:22.280 --> 04:25.200
 Let's get to New York by Monday morning,

04:25.200 --> 04:27.680
 and then from New York, we're gonna go to Philly,

04:27.680 --> 04:30.120
 and we've gotta be in Philly at four.

04:30.120 --> 04:32.080
 A vague beginning and end is fine,

04:32.080 --> 04:36.520
 but I think having very strict guidelines in between

04:36.520 --> 04:39.800
 will rob you of certain experiences along the way.

04:39.800 --> 04:43.880
 If you have a timeframe to get from Philly to Indianapolis

04:43.880 --> 04:46.080
 and some awesome shit starts to happen in Philly,

04:46.080 --> 04:47.440
 do you really wanna have to cut it short

04:47.440 --> 04:50.280
 because you gotta be in Indianapolis by sunup?

04:50.280 --> 04:52.680
 Why do you have to be anywhere by any time

04:52.680 --> 04:54.280
 for any reason, really?

04:54.280 --> 04:55.520
 Plans change.

04:55.520 --> 04:56.960
 Plans change all the time, exactly,

04:56.960 --> 05:00.160
 but if we're talking about having a mission

05:00.160 --> 05:01.960
 or the type of road trip,

05:01.960 --> 05:04.040
 I just think it would be best to have it

05:04.040 --> 05:07.680
 as loose and flexible as possible.

05:07.680 --> 05:08.520
 I don't know.

05:08.520 --> 05:12.320
 You gotta make hard deadlines and then break them.

05:12.320 --> 05:13.520
 Totally change the plans.

05:13.520 --> 05:15.680
 Disappoint people, break promises.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.080
 That's the way of life.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.160
 Somebody's waiting for you in St. Louis,

05:19.160 --> 05:21.560
 and all of a sudden, you fell in love

05:21.560 --> 05:23.640
 with a biker in New York.

05:23.640 --> 05:24.480
 I don't know.

05:24.480 --> 05:25.400
 I don't know what you're up to.

05:25.400 --> 05:29.680
 I can appreciate that, but on a trip like that,

05:29.680 --> 05:33.120
 I feel like a trip with deadlines

05:33.120 --> 05:34.920
 is for a different point in your life,

05:34.920 --> 05:35.960
 and at this point in my life,

05:35.960 --> 05:37.440
 I don't want any of the deadlines

05:37.440 --> 05:39.760
 because it's not about meeting someone

05:39.760 --> 05:41.640
 and disappointing them in St. Louis.

05:41.640 --> 05:45.320
 It's about me not disappointing myself.

05:45.320 --> 05:48.360
 You wanna have enough time in what you're doing

05:48.360 --> 05:50.480
 to make sure that you get the full breadth

05:50.480 --> 05:52.800
 of every experience that you encounter.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.320
 How would you fully experience a place?

05:55.320 --> 05:56.160
 How would you?

05:56.160 --> 05:59.160
 I don't think I've actually fully experienced Boston.

05:59.160 --> 06:02.080
 If you were showing up to a city for a week

06:02.080 --> 06:04.440
 on this road trip, what would you do?

06:04.440 --> 06:06.600
 So I'm gonna answer that in two parts.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.080
 A few years ago, I had an opportunity to move out of Boston,

06:09.080 --> 06:12.280
 and the thing that kept me here, no question about it,

06:12.280 --> 06:16.040
 was the fact that I felt like I had a contract

06:16.040 --> 06:18.560
 with my students, and I did not.

06:18.560 --> 06:22.280
 I felt like a great many of them took a leap of faith

06:22.280 --> 06:26.320
 by joining my gym and asking me to teach them what I know,

06:26.320 --> 06:29.360
 and when I had an opportunity to leave Boston,

06:29.360 --> 06:30.720
 I thought of those people,

06:30.720 --> 06:33.560
 and I thought, I wanna fulfill my obligation to them.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.840
 So because I made a decision to stay here,

06:35.840 --> 06:37.560
 I then that summer made a decision

06:37.560 --> 06:39.440
 to endear myself to the city of Boston,

06:39.440 --> 06:40.920
 and I tried to find lots and lots

06:40.920 --> 06:42.360
 of different things to do.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.840
 I can tell you that the coolest thing

06:43.840 --> 06:47.520
 that I found to do in this city is the MFA,

06:48.400 --> 06:50.560
 where they have on Friday nights,

06:50.560 --> 06:52.440
 they'll have different exhibits and stuff,

06:52.440 --> 06:55.160
 and they'll have little beer carts and food tents,

06:55.160 --> 06:59.040
 and you can go do a painting class off on the side.

06:59.040 --> 07:01.640
 Very cool night of things to do.

07:01.640 --> 07:04.600
 But in general, whenever I'm in a new city,

07:04.600 --> 07:06.560
 I try not to pay attention to Google,

07:06.560 --> 07:10.160
 and I try not to do anything that I find on a travel site.

07:10.160 --> 07:13.160
 The best thing to do is to walk out of your hotel

07:13.160 --> 07:14.480
 or wherever it is you're staying

07:14.480 --> 07:17.240
 and find the most normal looking bar,

07:17.240 --> 07:19.280
 have a drink, and talk to a bartender.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.000
 So the people, the people.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.440
 The people, and then you can experience that town

07:23.440 --> 07:25.560
 the way that they experience it.

07:25.560 --> 07:28.880
 Even in a city where there are tons of tourist attractions,

07:28.880 --> 07:32.280
 locals probably visit the same tourist attractions

07:32.280 --> 07:34.080
 when they have visitors come from out of town,

07:34.080 --> 07:36.680
 you wanna see how they view those places

07:36.680 --> 07:38.040
 and how they visit them.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.640
 And you wanna go to eat where they're going to eat.

07:40.640 --> 07:44.600
 Like, you're gonna, for the most part,

07:44.600 --> 07:47.080
 the North End is not a place where I would take someone

07:47.080 --> 07:49.320
 and say, hey, this is Boston's,

07:49.320 --> 07:51.320
 the pinnacle of Boston dining,

07:51.320 --> 07:52.400
 because it's very touristy.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.280
 There are a handful of really good restaurants there,

07:54.280 --> 07:56.520
 but I wanna know where the,

07:56.520 --> 07:57.840
 I wanna go to Bogie's Place.

07:57.840 --> 08:00.480
 I wanna know the down low spots where.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.520
 The hell's Bogie's Place?

08:01.520 --> 08:04.080
 It's like a little steakhouse in the back of J.M. Curly's.

08:04.080 --> 08:04.920
 Exactly.

08:04.920 --> 08:06.000
 It's like a shitty bar?

08:06.000 --> 08:06.840
 J.M. Curly's?

08:06.840 --> 08:09.080
 No, it's just a bar with like bar food.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.280
 But I think that like.

08:11.280 --> 08:12.360
 In South Boston?

08:12.360 --> 08:13.200
 It is in Boston, yeah.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.200
 It's not South Boston?

08:14.200 --> 08:18.680
 No, it's in, it's in the downtown area.

08:18.680 --> 08:21.360
 Like, I don't know what the neighborhoods

08:21.360 --> 08:22.360
 are called here, honestly,

08:22.360 --> 08:25.280
 because they have an area called Downtown Boston,

08:25.280 --> 08:27.080
 and I don't even know what the hell that means.

08:27.080 --> 08:28.280
 And they used to have the Financial District.

08:28.280 --> 08:29.440
 Where's Southie?

08:29.440 --> 08:31.080
 Cause I've heard about the Southie.

08:31.080 --> 08:33.000
 Southie is South Boston.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.400
 But is there a difference between South Boston and Southie?

08:36.400 --> 08:37.760
 No, it's the same thing.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.400
 No, but like, you know, the mythical Southie.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.280
 I think the mythical Southie

08:41.280 --> 08:44.040
 is something that's long gone now.

08:44.040 --> 08:48.960
 And the term now actually is Sobo.

08:48.960 --> 08:49.800
 Oh no.

08:49.800 --> 08:50.640
 Yeah, it's.

08:50.640 --> 08:52.800
 It's changed, what, who took over what?

08:52.800 --> 08:55.240
 What's the, you know, the good will hunting personality.

08:55.240 --> 08:56.280
 That's Southie, isn't it?

08:56.280 --> 08:58.440
 Strong accent, those bad ass dudes.

08:58.440 --> 09:00.840
 I came here right at the end of like,

09:00.840 --> 09:02.280
 what was South Boston.

09:02.280 --> 09:05.040
 So when I got, and my gym is in South Boston,

09:05.040 --> 09:07.480
 the neighborhood was just starting to change.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.520
 So I think,

09:12.880 --> 09:14.440
 as gentrification happened

09:14.440 --> 09:16.880
 and they started building more luxury condominiums,

09:16.880 --> 09:18.600
 they were buying all these old businesses out,

09:18.600 --> 09:19.840
 all the mom and pop businesses.

09:19.840 --> 09:23.480
 And I think that kind of changed

09:23.480 --> 09:25.840
 the makeup of the community.

09:25.840 --> 09:27.920
 And it wasn't only because there was an influx

09:27.920 --> 09:31.160
 of new young people with disposable income,

09:31.160 --> 09:34.200
 it's because there's an exodus of the older people

09:34.200 --> 09:35.800
 who kind of grew up and raised their families there

09:35.800 --> 09:37.080
 because they were being offered

09:37.080 --> 09:39.000
 humongous sums of money for their homes

09:39.000 --> 09:41.480
 that they had bought like in the late 70s and early 80s

09:41.480 --> 09:43.200
 so that they could develop those areas.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.000
 So you have a combination of the influx of new people

09:46.000 --> 09:47.480
 and the exodus of the old,

09:47.480 --> 09:49.640
 and now you just got this totally new neighborhood

09:49.640 --> 09:50.880
 in its place.

09:52.040 --> 09:53.520
 What do you love about Boston?

09:53.520 --> 09:58.520
 Is there a love still for Boston?

09:58.520 --> 10:00.280
 You certainly have the love of the thing

10:00.280 --> 10:01.760
 that's gone as well.

10:01.760 --> 10:05.080
 Yeah, I think, I don't wanna pinpoint pin this on Boston

10:05.080 --> 10:08.040
 because it's happening in all great cities.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.160
 As these areas become gentrified,

10:10.160 --> 10:11.680
 what's happening is the personality

10:11.680 --> 10:12.960
 and the character of the neighborhood

10:12.960 --> 10:14.960
 is just being run out.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.920
 And I have nothing against people coming in

10:16.920 --> 10:18.240
 and making money and things like that.

10:18.240 --> 10:21.400
 But when you do it at the expense of the culture,

10:21.400 --> 10:24.400
 the character and the personality of the neighborhood,

10:24.400 --> 10:27.160
 I mean, you're kind of standing on the shoulders of giants.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.360
 These are the people that came here

10:28.360 --> 10:30.200
 and built these areas up.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.800
 It happens here in Boston,

10:31.800 --> 10:34.560
 it happens in all over New York,

10:34.560 --> 10:36.680
 happens on the West Coast.

10:36.680 --> 10:41.160
 So what I love about Boston is not nearly as romantic

10:41.160 --> 10:42.960
 as what it might've been 15 years ago

10:42.960 --> 10:45.080
 and what I used to love about New York.

10:45.080 --> 10:50.080
 What I love about Boston is that it's walkable.

10:51.640 --> 10:54.440
 The food scene is on the rise here.

10:55.880 --> 10:59.600
 But I think you're hard pressed to find the charm

10:59.600 --> 11:03.440
 that people think of when they think of old Boston

11:03.440 --> 11:04.600
 and old New England city.

11:04.600 --> 11:05.880
 So yeah, I see it differently.

11:05.880 --> 11:08.560
 People sometimes criticize like MIT

11:08.560 --> 11:11.440
 like for the thing that it is now.

11:11.440 --> 11:13.600
 But I think it is always like that.

11:13.600 --> 11:18.600
 I tend to prefer to carry the flame of the greatness,

11:20.320 --> 11:22.440
 the greatest moments of its history

11:22.440 --> 11:26.160
 and like sort of enjoy the echoes of that

11:26.160 --> 11:27.320
 in the halls of MIT.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.800
 In the same way in Boston, you think about the history

11:29.800 --> 11:33.080
 and that history lives on in the few individuals.

11:33.080 --> 11:36.960
 Like you can't just look around what Boston is now

11:36.960 --> 11:38.840
 and be like, what has Boston become?

11:38.840 --> 11:43.400
 I think it was always carried by a minority of individuals.

11:43.400 --> 11:46.000
 I think we kind of look back in history

11:46.000 --> 11:48.400
 and think like times were greater

11:48.400 --> 11:50.360
 in a certain kind of dimension back then.

11:50.360 --> 11:52.800
 But that's because we remember,

11:53.880 --> 11:57.400
 this is a ridiculous non data driven assertion of mine,

11:57.400 --> 12:02.400
 is to remember just the brightest stars of that history.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.160
 And so we romanticize it.

12:04.160 --> 12:05.800
 But I think if you look around now,

12:05.800 --> 12:07.960
 those special people are still living in Boston

12:07.960 --> 12:10.480
 for which Boston will be remembered as a great city

12:10.480 --> 12:11.920
 in like 50 years.

12:11.920 --> 12:14.040
 I think you're probably right, but isn't there some sort

12:14.040 --> 12:19.040
 of theory about the point that there's like a certain age

12:20.040 --> 12:22.400
 in your life where things resonate differently to you?

12:22.400 --> 12:23.600
 Like, I think they've done studies

12:23.600 --> 12:26.560
 where most people stop searching for new music

12:26.560 --> 12:28.080
 after age 19.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.600
 Most dads you see like wearing super old clothes,

12:30.600 --> 12:33.840
 like that's the style of the time period

12:33.840 --> 12:35.960
 of the last great part of their life.

12:35.960 --> 12:38.760
 So like there's an evolution in people

12:38.760 --> 12:41.560
 and it could also be the memories of where they live.

12:41.560 --> 12:44.160
 And when I was 17, of course my neighborhood

12:44.160 --> 12:46.520
 was the best then because I was having the most fun.

12:46.520 --> 12:49.640
 And we always kind of look at things through that tint,

12:49.640 --> 12:51.720
 I think, and you're right.

12:51.720 --> 12:53.120
 And I don't think there's anything wrong

12:53.120 --> 12:55.600
 with the way cities are evolving now.

12:55.600 --> 13:00.600
 It's just not, I prefer the time of like a mom and pop store,

13:01.400 --> 13:06.400
 not a fabricated like gastropub that could just be like

13:06.600 --> 13:08.320
 on a four lane super highway

13:08.320 --> 13:10.520
 on your way out of Epcot Center.

13:10.520 --> 13:13.480
 And it's actually owned by like some conglomerate.

13:13.480 --> 13:15.200
 But there's still the special places.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.760
 Like I, this takes us back to the road trip

13:17.760 --> 13:22.560
 is maybe I tend to romanticize the experiences

13:22.560 --> 13:25.520
 of like the diners in the middle of nowhere.

13:25.520 --> 13:27.880
 What would you say makes for like,

13:29.520 --> 13:33.240
 it feels like life is made up of these experiences

13:33.240 --> 13:36.400
 that maybe on paper seem mundane,

13:36.400 --> 13:39.720
 but are actually somehow give you a chance

13:39.720 --> 13:42.000
 to pause and reflect on life

13:42.000 --> 13:45.080
 with like a certain kind of people,

13:45.080 --> 13:47.920
 whether like really close friends or complete strangers,

13:47.920 --> 13:50.040
 maybe alcohol is involved in the middle of nowhere.

13:50.040 --> 13:52.800
 It seems like a road trip facilitates that

13:52.800 --> 13:54.120
 if you allow it to.

13:54.120 --> 13:56.000
 Like what do you think makes for those kinds of experience?

13:56.000 --> 13:56.920
 Have you had any?

13:57.760 --> 14:00.640
 I think in the context of a road trip,

14:00.640 --> 14:02.880
 I think it's like hyper localization.

14:02.880 --> 14:10.640
 And I think it is those experiences along the way

14:10.640 --> 14:14.200
 with people and the people that you're with

14:14.200 --> 14:15.600
 will color the experiences differently

14:15.600 --> 14:17.840
 depending on the person.

14:17.840 --> 14:20.000
 The road trip you took was with somebody else or alone?

14:20.000 --> 14:23.240
 So I've driven up and down the East Coast several times.

14:23.240 --> 14:26.680
 When I drove from LA to New York,

14:26.680 --> 14:29.960
 my friend was on the run from the cops.

14:29.960 --> 14:30.800
 Yeah.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.200
 So we were trying to get out of.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.240
 Traffic tickets?

14:33.240 --> 14:34.520
 Yeah, traffic tickets.

14:34.520 --> 14:35.520
 Yeah, allegedly.

14:35.520 --> 14:36.960
 We were trying to get out of LA

14:36.960 --> 14:40.520
 because he was going to have to go away for a little while.

14:40.520 --> 14:43.200
 So we drove from LA and we just,

14:43.200 --> 14:45.120
 we were young kids, we had no idea what we were doing,

14:45.120 --> 14:46.840
 and we drove East.

14:46.840 --> 14:49.680
 And then we had an unbelievable trip,

14:49.680 --> 14:52.000
 mostly because we didn't really have a destination,

14:52.000 --> 14:54.760
 we didn't really have a timeframe, thank goodness,

14:54.760 --> 14:57.120
 because he got arrested again in Pennsylvania.

14:57.120 --> 14:59.080
 So we got kind of stuck there.

14:59.080 --> 15:02.040
 And then we drove back to LA

15:02.040 --> 15:04.040
 when he got out in Pennsylvania.

15:05.920 --> 15:08.000
 But all the stops along the way

15:08.960 --> 15:10.800
 were kind of like weird things,

15:10.800 --> 15:11.880
 like you have no money, right?

15:11.880 --> 15:14.160
 So you're finding that like a little diamond

15:14.160 --> 15:15.800
 in the rough place to eat,

15:15.800 --> 15:18.160
 the diner you talk about, like that place.

15:18.160 --> 15:20.840
 I once was in, where was I?

15:20.840 --> 15:22.080
 I think I was in Buenos Aires.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.880
 And the guy that I was with, he said,

15:23.880 --> 15:26.920
 I know this quaint little spot around the corner.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.440
 And I was young, I was like 25.

15:28.440 --> 15:32.040
 And I thought the coolest thing in the world would be

15:32.040 --> 15:33.960
 to be such a citizen of the world

15:33.960 --> 15:36.800
 that you know these quaint little spots around the corner

15:36.800 --> 15:38.240
 in like all these great cities.

15:38.240 --> 15:40.720
 Like I know where to get this great chicken sandwich

15:40.720 --> 15:41.560
 in Argentina.

15:41.560 --> 15:44.080
 I know where to get this great meal in Costa Rica.

15:44.080 --> 15:48.400
 I know where to get this super local egg in another country.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.000
 And I just thought that that was really cool,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.920
 the ability to do that anywhere in the world.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.880
 Did you get closer with that guy through the trip?

15:55.880 --> 15:58.880
 I found that like, so I took a trip across the United States

15:58.880 --> 16:01.200
 with a guy friend of mine.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.280
 We had different goals.

16:02.280 --> 16:04.000
 I was searching for meaning in life

16:04.000 --> 16:05.520
 and he was searching for,

16:06.800 --> 16:09.680
 what's the politically correct way of phrasing it,

16:09.680 --> 16:12.480
 but just basically trying to sleep

16:12.480 --> 16:15.360
 with every kind of woman that this world has to offer.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.080
 What's the difference between those two things?

16:17.080 --> 16:18.360
 Well, I guess he was searching

16:18.360 --> 16:20.080
 for the different kinds of meanings.

16:20.080 --> 16:25.080
 Yeah, I mean, I still think that you can't find meaning

16:26.280 --> 16:28.520
 between a woman's legs, I suppose.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.000
 Have you tried all of them?

16:31.720 --> 16:34.160
 But there was a tension there.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.400
 We grew closer with those experiences,

16:36.400 --> 16:38.000
 but we've gotten in fights.

16:39.280 --> 16:42.080
 There was a lot of like literal almost fights

16:42.080 --> 16:44.760
 and then we were close and there was like silences,

16:44.760 --> 16:46.240
 but then we were like brothers

16:46.240 --> 16:49.920
 and this whole weird journey of friendship that we went on.

16:49.920 --> 16:52.840
 I think anytime you spend that much time

16:52.840 --> 16:55.720
 in like a small space with another person,

16:55.720 --> 16:57.600
 you're gonna have the different parts

16:57.600 --> 16:59.200
 of the relationship will manifest themselves.

16:59.200 --> 17:00.840
 You'll have the periods of closeness.

17:00.840 --> 17:02.320
 You'll have the periods of vulnerability

17:02.320 --> 17:04.720
 where it's like maybe you're driving through Denver

17:04.720 --> 17:05.680
 and it's three in the morning

17:05.680 --> 17:06.720
 and you talk about something

17:06.720 --> 17:08.600
 you might not have otherwise talked about.

17:08.600 --> 17:09.440
 You'll have the periods

17:09.440 --> 17:12.240
 where you don't wanna see that motherfucker ever again.

17:12.240 --> 17:15.520
 He didn't, and depending could be because of anything.

17:16.520 --> 17:19.520
 But the guy that I drove twice with,

17:19.520 --> 17:22.640
 we're still in contact, we're still buddies.

17:24.480 --> 17:27.000
 We have very different goals also,

17:27.000 --> 17:28.120
 but at that point in our lives,

17:28.120 --> 17:31.760
 we never even contemplated the meaning of life.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.600
 We were about probably more to the point

17:34.600 --> 17:35.920
 of the friend that you drove with.

17:35.920 --> 17:38.080
 We were more about racking up experiences,

17:38.080 --> 17:39.040
 whatever they were.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.840
 I wanna be able to retell this.

17:42.720 --> 17:43.560
 Stories.

17:43.560 --> 17:45.080
 Yeah, I wanna be able to retell this

17:45.080 --> 17:47.200
 and it's gotta sound cool.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.040
 Like I don't wanna retell a story about,

17:49.040 --> 17:50.400
 yeah and then we drove through Alabama

17:50.400 --> 17:51.760
 and they've got a lovely library

17:51.760 --> 17:52.960
 and I checked out this book

17:52.960 --> 17:54.640
 and I'm not interested in retelling that.

17:54.640 --> 17:58.200
 Do you remember any, this is a kid's show,

17:58.200 --> 18:01.160
 do you remember any stories that the kids would enjoy

18:01.160 --> 18:04.200
 from those times that were profound in some kind of way?

18:05.400 --> 18:07.400
 There were some impactful moments

18:08.360 --> 18:11.200
 on the beginning of our road trip where we had no money

18:11.200 --> 18:13.320
 and as a couple of kids who knew nothing,

18:13.320 --> 18:15.560
 we literally had to, we stopped in Vegas

18:15.560 --> 18:17.440
 and we went to Circus Circus.

18:17.440 --> 18:19.280
 At the time they had $3 blackjack

18:19.280 --> 18:20.720
 and we had like 12 bucks

18:20.720 --> 18:22.560
 and my buddy was a kind of a degenerate gambler

18:22.560 --> 18:23.440
 so he knew what was up.

18:23.440 --> 18:25.480
 I was just like kind of stuffing chips in my pockets,

18:25.480 --> 18:28.200
 making sure we could pay for the gas.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.280
 And just being at a point which is like a starting line

18:31.280 --> 18:34.240
 and like we drove from LA to Vegas,

18:34.240 --> 18:36.040
 which is only about four hours

18:36.040 --> 18:38.280
 and being at the starting line and realizing like,

18:38.280 --> 18:41.200
 we may not even like get off the starting line here.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.800
 And if we don't, what are we doing?

18:42.800 --> 18:44.320
 We're gonna be two guys stuck in Vegas.

18:44.320 --> 18:45.160
 We have no money.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.040
 We can't go West because you're gonna get pinched.

18:47.040 --> 18:48.240
 We have no money to go East.

18:48.240 --> 18:49.080
 What the hell are we gonna do?

18:49.080 --> 18:50.540
 Are we gonna wind up in Vegas?

18:51.640 --> 18:53.840
 So, you know, that was kind of a profound thing

18:53.840 --> 18:56.440
 where you just, it's a turning,

18:56.440 --> 18:59.300
 it potentially could have been a turning point in our lives

18:59.300 --> 19:02.580
 had we not made enough money to continue going East.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.680
 That's the beautiful thing about road trips

19:05.680 --> 19:08.040
 when you're broke is like,

19:08.040 --> 19:10.920
 in retrospect, everything turned out fine,

19:10.920 --> 19:13.840
 but you're facing the complete darkness,

19:13.840 --> 19:16.720
 the uncertainty of the possibilities laid before you.

19:16.720 --> 19:20.200
 And like, I don't know if you were confident at that time,

19:20.200 --> 19:23.940
 but like, I was really full of self doubt.

19:23.940 --> 19:27.280
 Like just, all I could see is all the trajectories

19:27.280 --> 19:28.560
 where you just screw up your life.

19:28.560 --> 19:29.820
 Like, what am I doing with my life?

19:29.820 --> 19:32.300
 I'm a failure, like all these dreams I've had,

19:32.300 --> 19:34.640
 I've never realized I'm a complete piece of shit.

19:34.640 --> 19:35.480
 All those kinds of things.

19:35.480 --> 19:38.000
 I had no concept of consequence.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.080
 I probably had toxoplasmosis.

19:42.080 --> 19:45.060
 I had literally no concept of consequence.

19:45.060 --> 19:47.320
 Immediate gratification was all I cared about.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.860
 Oh, so existentialist.

19:48.860 --> 19:53.860
 Yeah, it did not even enter my mind in my like early 20s

19:55.180 --> 19:57.440
 that anything that I was doing at that point

19:57.440 --> 19:59.680
 could reverberate for the rest of my life.

19:59.680 --> 20:02.360
 I think part of me didn't even think I'd make it this far.

20:02.360 --> 20:05.560
 And so I was not interested in like the long play.

20:05.560 --> 20:06.400
 I remember thinking like,

20:06.400 --> 20:08.900
 why should I be acting now in a way

20:08.900 --> 20:12.040
 that might impact a point in my life I never reach?

20:12.040 --> 20:17.040
 And yet now you are a man who searches for meaning in life,

20:17.240 --> 20:20.760
 at least I would say to put another way,

20:20.760 --> 20:25.260
 you think deeply about this world

20:25.260 --> 20:27.480
 and in a philosophical context

20:27.480 --> 20:30.480
 while also appreciating the violence

20:30.480 --> 20:35.400
 of hurting other friends of yours, right?

20:35.400 --> 20:36.400
 On a regular basis.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.960
 So why do you think, I mean,

20:38.960 --> 20:40.680
 maybe there's a broader question there,

20:40.680 --> 20:42.500
 but it calls a personal question.

20:42.500 --> 20:47.500
 It seems that people who fight for prolonged periods of time,

20:49.040 --> 20:52.080
 like Jiu Jitsu people and mixed martial arts people,

20:52.080 --> 20:57.080
 even military folks become over time philosophers.

20:57.400 --> 20:58.280
 What is that?

20:58.280 --> 21:02.160
 Is that, is there a parallel between fighting and violence

21:02.160 --> 21:05.160
 and the philosophical depth with which you now have arrived

21:05.160 --> 21:07.740
 from the starting point of being the full existentialist

21:07.740 --> 21:09.800
 of like just living in the moment

21:09.800 --> 21:14.800
 to like being introspective human now?

21:14.800 --> 21:18.360
 I would say to that being a soldier

21:18.360 --> 21:22.660
 or a warrior hundreds of years ago

21:22.660 --> 21:24.820
 is probably what started the marriage

21:24.820 --> 21:28.160
 between martial arts and philosophy.

21:28.160 --> 21:31.060
 If you're constantly under someone else's charge

21:31.060 --> 21:33.080
 and you're told to go out and walk in a line

21:33.080 --> 21:36.840
 and overtake some Germanic tribe somewhere

21:36.840 --> 21:41.840
 and that happens all the time, your job is being a soldier.

21:43.760 --> 21:46.560
 On any given day, you might not come home.

21:46.560 --> 21:48.240
 So I think that you have to start your day

21:48.240 --> 21:52.240
 by thinking deeply about how you've lived to that point

21:52.240 --> 21:54.500
 and the people that are living in and around you

21:54.500 --> 21:55.800
 and how you've treated them.

21:55.800 --> 21:58.140
 And I think that probably is what started the marriage

21:58.140 --> 22:02.200
 of being kind of like a philosophical martial artist.

22:02.200 --> 22:06.080
 You've got to really like on a daily basis,

22:06.080 --> 22:09.960
 take stock of what's going on around you and inside you

22:09.960 --> 22:13.880
 because we all suffer with this kind of idea.

22:13.880 --> 22:16.440
 If today's my last day, did I do it right?

22:16.440 --> 22:18.160
 And we don't really do it so much nowadays

22:18.160 --> 22:19.860
 because we're so comfortable,

22:19.860 --> 22:22.300
 but if we were being marched out to war every day,

22:22.300 --> 22:25.000
 I think you'd see people live a little bit differently.

22:26.280 --> 22:28.000
 And you treat the people around you

22:28.000 --> 22:29.040
 a little bit differently.

22:29.040 --> 22:30.720
 Do you think there's echoes of that

22:30.720 --> 22:35.320
 in just even the sport of like grappling and Jiu Jitsu

22:35.320 --> 22:37.200
 where you're facing your own mortality?

22:37.200 --> 22:39.640
 We don't really think of it that way, but.

22:39.640 --> 22:41.560
 To be honest, I think that a lot of people

22:41.560 --> 22:45.520
 that train in a martial art in contemporary society,

22:45.520 --> 22:48.080
 I don't consider them all martial artists.

22:48.080 --> 22:50.000
 I think just because you train in martial art

22:50.000 --> 22:51.480
 does not mean you're a martial artist.

22:51.480 --> 22:53.880
 There are so many people that use martial arts

22:53.880 --> 22:57.200
 as a form of exercise and like this little piece

22:57.200 --> 23:00.120
 of self concept.

23:00.120 --> 23:04.800
 They use martial arts as a tagline in their Instagram bio.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.640
 And it's really a form of exercise.

23:06.640 --> 23:09.320
 It's something they do, it's not something they are.

23:09.320 --> 23:11.720
 And I think there's a big difference there.

23:11.720 --> 23:13.520
 There's a bunch of stuff mixed up in there

23:13.520 --> 23:16.840
 because the Instagram thing is something you do for,

23:17.880 --> 23:20.800
 it's also, it could be something you are for display

23:20.800 --> 23:24.000
 versus who you are in the private moments

23:24.000 --> 23:26.560
 of searching and thinking and struggling

23:26.560 --> 23:27.400
 and all that kind of stuff.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.680
 Instagram is a surface layer

23:29.680 --> 23:34.000
 that much of modern society operates in,

23:34.000 --> 23:37.320
 which is really problematic because there's that gap

23:37.320 --> 23:40.520
 between the person you show to the world

23:40.520 --> 23:42.440
 and the person you are in private life.

23:42.440 --> 23:45.680
 And if you make majority of your project

23:45.680 --> 23:48.080
 of the human project of your sort of few years

23:48.080 --> 23:50.560
 on this earth, the optimization

23:50.560 --> 23:53.200
 of the public Instagram profile,

23:53.200 --> 23:56.000
 then you never develop this private person.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.280
 But it does seem that if you do jiu jitsu long enough,

23:58.280 --> 24:00.720
 it's very difficult not to fall into like,

24:00.720 --> 24:04.960
 this has become a personal journey,

24:04.960 --> 24:06.440
 an intellectual journey.

24:06.440 --> 24:09.400
 Because like, if you get your ass kicked thousands of times,

24:09.400 --> 24:12.200
 there's a certain point to where that,

24:12.200 --> 24:14.440
 maybe it's like a defense mechanism,

24:14.440 --> 24:15.920
 but that turns into some kind

24:15.920 --> 24:18.520
 of deeply profound introspective experience

24:18.520 --> 24:20.720
 versus like exercise.

24:20.720 --> 24:21.920
 It's not yoga.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.960
 Yeah, so let me go back first

24:24.960 --> 24:26.360
 and address the Instagram point,

24:26.360 --> 24:28.080
 which I think there's a difference

24:28.080 --> 24:32.440
 between people whose Instagram is intrinsically tied

24:32.440 --> 24:34.080
 to their profession and they have

24:34.080 --> 24:35.880
 to put a specific profile out there.

24:35.880 --> 24:37.480
 And I think in general,

24:38.640 --> 24:42.560
 people who truthfully their business is tied

24:42.560 --> 24:45.400
 to their Instagram profile, I wanna exclude them.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.400
 I think that most people,

24:47.400 --> 24:50.160
 Instagram is how they want to be seen.

24:50.160 --> 24:53.360
 And that's not always congruent with who you are,

24:53.360 --> 24:58.360
 but I think there is a level of dishonesty there.

24:58.640 --> 25:00.440
 Like this is how I want people to see me.

25:00.440 --> 25:02.280
 I'm gonna put all this stuff in my Instagram bio,

25:02.280 --> 25:05.000
 but that's really not me.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.680
 And when you do that,

25:08.080 --> 25:11.640
 I think it's a little disingenuous and you're right.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.760
 There's not, you're never really gonna marry

25:13.760 --> 25:15.840
 those two things together and it gets tough.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.320
 Let me, sorry to interrupt,

25:17.320 --> 25:18.720
 let me push back on something.

25:18.720 --> 25:23.080
 This is a good time to address the many flaws

25:23.080 --> 25:25.600
 of the great and powerful John Clark.

25:25.600 --> 25:29.360
 Okay, let's go there.

25:29.360 --> 25:30.520
 Cause it's interesting.

25:31.440 --> 25:35.840
 You strive so hard for excellence in your life

25:35.840 --> 25:40.720
 and for extreme competence that you are visibly

25:40.720 --> 25:43.120
 and physically off put by people

25:43.120 --> 25:45.320
 who have not achieved competence.

25:46.960 --> 25:51.960
 Do you think we should be nicer to the people who are,

25:51.960 --> 25:56.520
 like you mentioned, a person who first picks up an art,

25:56.520 --> 26:00.360
 picks up, becomes vegan, starts doing CrossFit,

26:00.360 --> 26:02.400
 start doing Jiu Jitsu for the first time

26:02.400 --> 26:04.280
 and create that as their,

26:04.280 --> 26:07.120
 they're struggling through this like, who am I?

26:07.120 --> 26:11.040
 And they're really overly proud and it's kind of ridiculous.

26:11.040 --> 26:15.760
 And you and your wise chair have seen many battles.

26:15.760 --> 26:19.820
 Yeah, that you see the ridiculousness of that.

26:19.820 --> 26:24.820
 I tend to, I'm learning to give those folks,

26:25.320 --> 26:28.520
 not to mock them and to sort of give them a chance

26:28.520 --> 26:32.400
 to do their ridiculousness because I think I was that too.

26:32.400 --> 26:34.200
 Let me first clarify.

26:34.200 --> 26:36.320
 I wanna be clear about what you mean

26:36.320 --> 26:38.320
 when you say a level of competence.

26:38.320 --> 26:41.240
 Now I've never won a world championship.

26:41.240 --> 26:45.280
 I've never, you know, there are plenty of things in my life

26:45.280 --> 26:50.200
 where I've not achieved what most people would consider

26:50.200 --> 26:54.080
 to be the penultimate level of success.

26:54.080 --> 26:54.920
 Now.

26:54.920 --> 26:56.160
 That's accomplishments.

26:56.160 --> 26:58.480
 It's accomplishments, it's ribbons, it's things like that.

26:58.480 --> 27:00.560
 And it's not that those things don't mean anything to me.

27:00.560 --> 27:03.240
 And the fact that I haven't in some arenas

27:03.240 --> 27:06.640
 is something that I wanna change,

27:06.640 --> 27:09.320
 which is, we can talk about that in a second.

27:09.320 --> 27:11.680
 But I think that there's a difference

27:11.680 --> 27:16.320
 between the very eager noob of whatever it is they're doing

27:17.160 --> 27:22.160
 who does the thing so that they can signal

27:22.340 --> 27:24.040
 they do the thing.

27:24.040 --> 27:26.800
 That's a person I have less respect for.

27:26.800 --> 27:29.860
 So we know each other primarily through jujitsu.

27:29.860 --> 27:31.320
 Look at a jujitsu tournament.

27:32.740 --> 27:37.280
 There's this idea that people espouse online.

27:37.280 --> 27:40.680
 I respect anyone with the guts to get on the mat

27:40.680 --> 27:43.240
 and put it on the line and sign up for a tournament.

27:43.240 --> 27:47.480
 That is the biggest load of shit I have ever heard.

27:47.480 --> 27:48.320
 This is great.

27:48.320 --> 27:50.840
 Do you know how easy it is for you

27:50.840 --> 27:52.280
 to put your name on something

27:52.280 --> 27:54.320
 and pay the registration fee and walk in there?

27:54.320 --> 27:55.520
 That's not the hard part.

27:55.520 --> 27:57.400
 That's the easiest part.

27:57.400 --> 27:58.920
 I don't care if you lose your first match,

27:58.920 --> 28:02.400
 but I respect the person who signs up for the tournament,

28:02.400 --> 28:05.040
 registers for the tournament, goes on a diet,

28:05.040 --> 28:07.740
 loses weight the right way, trains their ass off,

28:07.740 --> 28:10.720
 and does the things properly and then goes on the mat.

28:10.720 --> 28:12.960
 The person who simply signs their name

28:12.960 --> 28:16.100
 on the registration form and jumps on the mat,

28:16.100 --> 28:17.600
 if they haven't done these other things,

28:17.600 --> 28:19.680
 they actually have nothing to lose.

28:19.680 --> 28:21.920
 Because what they've done is they've stepped onto the mat,

28:21.920 --> 28:25.760
 in the ring, in the cage with a bucket full of excuses.

28:25.760 --> 28:29.680
 Sure you signed up, but you're not really vulnerable

28:29.680 --> 28:31.800
 because you didn't run, you didn't do this,

28:31.800 --> 28:33.640
 you didn't do all the things you're supposed to do.

28:33.640 --> 28:38.360
 The person who eliminates every possible excuse

28:38.360 --> 28:40.120
 and then steps on the mat

28:40.120 --> 28:42.240
 and gets their ass kicked in the first round,

28:42.240 --> 28:44.840
 I have so much more respect for that person

28:44.840 --> 28:46.160
 than the person who does nothing

28:46.160 --> 28:48.800
 and maybe on natural ability wins a couple of matches

28:48.800 --> 28:50.960
 and then writes on Facebook

28:50.960 --> 28:54.040
 on how I lost to the eventual champion.

28:54.040 --> 28:56.320
 That's worth zero, that's worth zero.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.880
 And in that process, what did you learn about yourself?

28:58.880 --> 29:00.480
 You learned about yourself

29:00.480 --> 29:02.800
 that you've got a natural level of aptitude

29:02.800 --> 29:05.080
 for whatever this activity is that you're doing,

29:05.080 --> 29:07.760
 but you didn't actually learn how to maximize it

29:07.760 --> 29:10.160
 through training and through dedication

29:10.160 --> 29:12.440
 and through all these other things.

29:12.440 --> 29:17.440
 I'm an incredibly interested, novice musician.

29:17.440 --> 29:20.400
 I like to play bass, but I don't put that on anything.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.280
 And I stink at it.

29:22.280 --> 29:24.120
 I would really love to be sick at it.

29:24.120 --> 29:28.680
 I'm currently not, but I'm not running around,

29:28.680 --> 29:31.360
 talking about entering, any of those other things.

29:31.360 --> 29:33.400
 I do it, it's for myself

29:33.400 --> 29:37.240
 and I wanna reach a level of competence in that.

29:37.240 --> 29:40.680
 So the person that you have respect for

29:40.680 --> 29:44.400
 is a person who takes it fully seriously,

29:44.400 --> 29:47.400
 takes the effort fully seriously.

29:47.400 --> 29:50.560
 So for bass, that would be that you agree with yourself

29:50.560 --> 29:51.960
 that you're going to perform live

29:51.960 --> 29:55.360
 and just in your own private moments, your private thoughts,

29:55.360 --> 29:57.880
 you're not going to give yourself an excuse out,

29:57.880 --> 29:59.120
 like, I'm just gonna have fun.

29:59.120 --> 30:00.400
 This is a nice experience.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.960
 You're going to think I'm going to try

30:02.960 --> 30:05.040
 to be the best possible bass player

30:05.040 --> 30:07.760
 given everything that's going on in my life,

30:07.760 --> 30:10.280
 but I'm going to do my, like actually,

30:10.280 --> 30:11.920
 and put it all on the line.

30:11.920 --> 30:16.640
 And if I fail, that's not because I didn't try,

30:16.640 --> 30:18.320
 it's because I'm a failure.

30:18.320 --> 30:19.160
 Exactly.

30:19.160 --> 30:24.160
 And then sit in that sick feeling of like, I'm a failure.

30:24.880 --> 30:26.440
 But isn't that an important thing to know?

30:26.440 --> 30:27.520
 Absolutely.

30:27.520 --> 30:32.520
 But there's a, that's like the best thing it could be,

30:34.280 --> 30:36.560
 but sometimes it's fun to lose yourself

30:36.560 --> 30:41.560
 in the bragging, in the lesser ways of life.

30:42.320 --> 30:45.600
 And I think I'm careful not to,

30:46.840 --> 30:48.840
 because too many people in my life,

30:49.720 --> 30:51.880
 when I brought them with like a little candle

30:51.880 --> 30:56.200
 of a fire of a dream, they would just go like,

30:56.200 --> 30:58.880
 they would just blow that fire out,

30:58.880 --> 31:00.640
 that they would dismiss me.

31:00.640 --> 31:03.960
 Cause they see like, I would say,

31:03.960 --> 31:05.800
 I've said a lot of ridiculous stuff,

31:05.800 --> 31:09.760
 but I've always dreamed about like putting,

31:10.880 --> 31:15.680
 I always dreamed of having this world full of robots.

31:15.680 --> 31:20.240
 And every time I would bring these ideas up,

31:20.240 --> 31:21.960
 they'll be shut down by the different people,

31:21.960 --> 31:26.960
 by my parents, by, then you need to first get an education.

31:28.080 --> 31:30.840
 You need to succeed in these dimensions.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.080
 In order to do all these things,

31:32.080 --> 31:33.200
 you have to get good grades.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.680
 You have to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

31:34.680 --> 31:38.240
 Like there's all this stuff that it's indirect

31:38.240 --> 31:41.720
 or direct ways of blowing out that little ridiculous dream

31:41.720 --> 31:43.240
 that you present.

31:43.240 --> 31:46.960
 And it's like, I remember sort of bringing up,

31:46.960 --> 31:51.960
 I don't know, things like becoming a state champion

31:53.000 --> 31:54.320
 in wrestling, right?

31:56.320 --> 32:00.080
 It's a weird dance because of course the coaches will tell,

32:00.080 --> 32:02.200
 they'll kind of dismiss that.

32:02.200 --> 32:04.760
 It's like, okay, okay.

32:04.760 --> 32:07.640
 But at the same time, it feels like in those early days,

32:07.640 --> 32:10.800
 you have to preserve that little fire.

32:10.800 --> 32:12.480
 Johnny Ive, I don't know if you know who that is,

32:12.480 --> 32:13.840
 is a designer at Apple.

32:13.840 --> 32:14.760
 He was a chief designer.

32:14.760 --> 32:17.560
 He's behind most of the iPhone, all that stuff.

32:17.560 --> 32:21.000
 And he always talked about that he wouldn't bring his ideas

32:21.000 --> 32:23.280
 to Steve Jobs until they were matured

32:23.280 --> 32:25.440
 because he would always shit on them.

32:25.440 --> 32:30.040
 He wanted them to as little babies live for a little bit

32:30.040 --> 32:31.880
 before they get completely shut down.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.840
 And I always think about that when I see a beginner

32:33.840 --> 32:37.200
 sort of bragging on Instagram, you have to be careful.

32:37.200 --> 32:39.640
 Let them play with that little dream.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.400
 Are you playing with a little dream that you're nurturing

32:43.400 --> 32:44.960
 and you're trying to take that little flame

32:44.960 --> 32:48.240
 and you're trying to create a roaring blaze with it?

32:48.240 --> 32:50.680
 Or are you playing with the idea of it

32:50.680 --> 32:54.120
 and behind that there's no substance?

32:54.120 --> 32:55.160
 It's hard to know the difference.

32:55.160 --> 32:56.600
 That's what I struggle with.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.000
 I don't think it necessarily is.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.160
 Certainly you're wrong.

32:59.160 --> 33:01.440
 And when I say Instagram,

33:01.440 --> 33:03.880
 I don't wanna impugn a bunch of strangers,

33:03.880 --> 33:05.560
 but I have a gym with a lot of members.

33:05.560 --> 33:07.680
 And I can tell you that the number of years

33:07.680 --> 33:08.720
 I've been in the gym,

33:08.720 --> 33:11.000
 when someone comes to me and says, this is my goal,

33:11.000 --> 33:15.200
 I don't tell them yes or no in general, but I know.

33:15.200 --> 33:17.320
 I can tell by the way they say it to me,

33:17.320 --> 33:18.680
 I can thin slice it.

33:18.680 --> 33:20.600
 I've seen the look on people's faces.

33:20.600 --> 33:24.360
 And when people start to say they wanna do X, Y, and Z,

33:24.360 --> 33:26.120
 I know right off the bat,

33:26.120 --> 33:27.720
 this person's either gonna put an effort in

33:27.720 --> 33:29.600
 or they're not going to put an effort in.

33:29.600 --> 33:33.640
 So to me, it's about the effort behind that.

33:33.640 --> 33:36.160
 If you're busting your ass and you're a new at something

33:36.160 --> 33:38.480
 and you're brand new, but you're working really hard

33:38.480 --> 33:42.480
 and you have a series of like moderate successes in that,

33:42.480 --> 33:44.280
 like that's the guy I wanna champion

33:44.280 --> 33:47.280
 because that persistence and that grit over time,

33:47.280 --> 33:49.760
 those successes will no longer be moderate.

33:49.760 --> 33:51.040
 They'll be huge.

33:51.040 --> 33:52.720
 But the person who's having moderate success

33:52.720 --> 33:55.600
 by doing nothing, chances are they'll never learn

33:55.600 --> 33:58.920
 to put that work in and the successes will never grow.

33:58.920 --> 34:01.560
 You have an admiration for Mike Tyson.

34:01.560 --> 34:02.400
 I love him.

34:03.640 --> 34:06.080
 I'm just gonna let that sit for a brief moment.

34:06.080 --> 34:09.240
 So why?

34:09.240 --> 34:10.640
 I think there's a combination of factors.

34:10.640 --> 34:13.400
 One is like the timeliness of his career

34:13.400 --> 34:17.520
 and like the age I was when he like came to prominence,

34:18.920 --> 34:23.000
 the raw, brutal violence

34:23.000 --> 34:26.520
 and the raw, brutal honesty when he speaks.

34:26.520 --> 34:29.640
 I think it's easy for people to hear him or see his life

34:29.640 --> 34:33.120
 and cast him aside as some simianesque,

34:33.120 --> 34:36.160
 like just cretin scourge on society.

34:36.160 --> 34:37.640
 But when you hear him speak,

34:37.640 --> 34:40.160
 like this is not a guy who's unintelligent.

34:40.160 --> 34:42.280
 This is a guy who knows himself better

34:42.280 --> 34:44.640
 than probably most of us know ourselves.

34:44.640 --> 34:48.840
 It's disarming and that's a humongous part

34:48.840 --> 34:52.440
 of my admiration for him.

34:52.440 --> 34:54.000
 Who is Mike Tyson?

34:54.000 --> 34:56.640
 Because it feels like there's similarities

34:56.640 --> 34:58.000
 between him and you.

34:59.160 --> 35:02.880
 It feels like there's a violent person in there,

35:02.880 --> 35:04.760
 but also a really kind person.

35:04.760 --> 35:07.800
 And they're all like living together in a little house.

35:07.800 --> 35:08.760
 And you're the same.

35:08.760 --> 35:10.400
 There's a thoughtful person,

35:10.400 --> 35:12.600
 but there's also a scary, violent person.

35:12.600 --> 35:14.560
 And they're like having a picnic.

35:14.560 --> 35:16.040
 They're having a picnic.

35:16.040 --> 35:18.760
 I think there are dialectical tensions in everyone,

35:18.760 --> 35:21.160
 these like opposing forces

35:21.160 --> 35:22.880
 that are constantly pulling at you

35:22.880 --> 35:24.560
 and at different points in your life,

35:24.560 --> 35:26.360
 like it's sliding scale.

35:26.360 --> 35:31.360
 And I think that certainly when I was a younger person,

35:31.360 --> 35:35.120
 that there was a lot more manifestation of the violence

35:35.120 --> 35:37.360
 and a lot less of the kindness.

35:38.880 --> 35:40.520
 People who were not as close to me

35:40.520 --> 35:42.280
 probably saw more of the violent side

35:42.280 --> 35:44.680
 and only the very close people to me saw like

35:44.680 --> 35:46.640
 what would pass for the kind side.

35:46.640 --> 35:49.720
 And now that's sliding in the other direction.

35:49.720 --> 35:52.200
 And I worry actually sometimes that

35:53.520 --> 35:55.200
 there could be a situation where I need

35:55.200 --> 35:57.280
 that old version of me

35:57.280 --> 35:59.280
 and he's getting further and further away

35:59.280 --> 36:01.840
 and I can't call him up if I need him.

36:01.840 --> 36:05.640
 And that concerns me to a certain degree.

36:07.160 --> 36:12.160
 The sad aging warrior seeing his greater self fade away.

36:12.400 --> 36:13.800
 But you still compete.

36:13.800 --> 36:15.200
 Does that person return?

36:15.200 --> 36:16.440
 It seems like for Mike Tyson,

36:16.440 --> 36:20.040
 that person returned at the prospect of competition.

36:20.040 --> 36:23.400
 It returns, but I've learned better

36:23.400 --> 36:26.040
 how to manifest it in competition

36:26.040 --> 36:27.600
 in terms of like the effects

36:27.600 --> 36:29.800
 that that type of emotion has on you physically

36:29.800 --> 36:31.200
 in the middle of a competition.

36:31.200 --> 36:34.400
 So I've better learned how to utilize that energy.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.960
 But I think another side effect of this

36:36.960 --> 36:39.440
 is like having a gym where you're a bigger guy

36:39.440 --> 36:40.920
 and you're the head instructor,

36:40.920 --> 36:43.880
 you can't be as mean and violent as you once were

36:43.880 --> 36:46.400
 because you're also not trying to run a business.

36:46.400 --> 36:51.160
 And you spend so many years trying not to be mean

36:51.160 --> 36:54.520
 and to soften your technique a little bit

36:54.520 --> 36:56.640
 that that all of a sudden just becomes who you are.

36:56.640 --> 36:58.520
 And I don't necessarily like that.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.760
 So I've been trying to reclaim that a little bit

37:00.760 --> 37:05.560
 on the mat, but I think in competition,

37:08.720 --> 37:13.720
 there has to be an athlete really wants to score the points.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.560
 A fighter really wants to incapacitate you

37:18.560 --> 37:20.240
 and put you in a position where they can

37:20.240 --> 37:21.600
 do their own bidding.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.680
 And the result in a jujitsu match

37:23.680 --> 37:25.560
 might just still be two points,

37:25.560 --> 37:28.320
 but the motivations are very, very different.

37:28.320 --> 37:30.480
 What do you make of Tyson on Joe Rogan

37:30.480 --> 37:32.560
 saying that he was aroused by violence?

37:32.560 --> 37:34.120
 Do you think that's insane?

37:34.120 --> 37:36.720
 Do you think that's deeply honest for him?

37:36.720 --> 37:40.280
 And do you think that rings true for many of us,

37:40.280 --> 37:43.120
 others who practices in different degrees?

37:43.120 --> 37:45.800
 I can't speak for a lot of people.

37:45.800 --> 37:48.840
 And I think that it was a brutally honest statement by him.

37:48.840 --> 37:51.640
 And I think it's something that even if a lot of people

37:51.640 --> 37:53.720
 feel it, they're not that comfortable

37:53.720 --> 37:55.600
 admitting it or saying it.

37:55.600 --> 38:00.600
 But I think there's great joy

38:01.480 --> 38:05.800
 in landing a flush right hand on someone's jaw

38:05.800 --> 38:07.320
 and then watching them crumble.

38:07.320 --> 38:08.480
 You don't even feel it.

38:08.480 --> 38:10.240
 You ever played baseball as a kid?

38:10.240 --> 38:11.960
 You can hit a base hit off the end of the bat

38:11.960 --> 38:13.360
 and it will sting your hands

38:13.360 --> 38:15.120
 because of the way that you hit it.

38:15.120 --> 38:18.360
 You can hit a home run and you won't feel anything.

38:18.360 --> 38:19.840
 It just feels so good in your hands.

38:19.840 --> 38:24.840
 And that's, I think, one of the joys of physical contact.

38:25.160 --> 38:27.040
 When you do it the right way,

38:27.040 --> 38:29.160
 and that goes for all physical contact.

38:29.160 --> 38:30.960
 When you do it the right way,

38:30.960 --> 38:33.600
 the physical pleasure you can derive from it

38:33.600 --> 38:38.080
 and the mental pleasure, it's unparalleled.

38:38.080 --> 38:39.400
 See, but that's different.

38:39.400 --> 38:40.920
 Let me draw a distinction.

38:40.920 --> 38:41.760
 I'm not,

38:44.640 --> 38:47.560
 I've had the fortune of being a wrestler.

38:47.560 --> 38:50.520
 And I would draw a distinction

38:50.520 --> 38:54.640
 between a very well executed in competition,

38:54.640 --> 38:57.960
 double leg, single leg take down or a pin.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.600
 There's some, as an OCD person,

38:59.600 --> 39:01.800
 there's something so comforting

39:01.800 --> 39:03.520
 about a well executed pin

39:03.520 --> 39:05.040
 because it's like two seconds

39:05.040 --> 39:07.640
 and it's just like everything is flush and nice.

39:07.640 --> 39:09.360
 And like, it's all clean.

39:09.360 --> 39:13.280
 I mean, okay, this OCD person who likes to align show,

39:13.280 --> 39:14.360
 it's just beautiful.

39:14.360 --> 39:16.120
 Okay, that's good technique.

39:16.120 --> 39:19.440
 And wrestling also provides you,

39:20.680 --> 39:22.560
 maybe more than other sports,

39:22.560 --> 39:25.680
 the feeling of dominating another human.

39:25.680 --> 39:26.520
 Yes.

39:26.520 --> 39:30.720
 Of breaking, no, not just of them being very cocky

39:30.720 --> 39:32.240
 and very powerful,

39:32.240 --> 39:34.880
 you feel this power of another human being

39:34.880 --> 39:37.440
 and then you breaking them.

39:37.440 --> 39:42.440
 And like, I'm not as honest as Mike Tyson.

39:42.440 --> 39:47.440
 But that, I don't think I've ever sort of looked in the mirror

39:48.200 --> 39:53.120
 and said like, that that was, I enjoyed that aspect of it.

39:53.120 --> 39:56.400
 But it certainly seems like you chase that.

39:56.400 --> 39:58.440
 So when I was a wrestler in high school,

40:00.120 --> 40:04.080
 I lost so many matches because of over aggressiveness.

40:05.040 --> 40:08.400
 Like, I would pick the top position and let you stand

40:08.400 --> 40:10.160
 just so that I could do a mat return.

40:10.160 --> 40:12.200
 And I wasn't trying to return you to the mat.

40:12.200 --> 40:15.360
 I was actually trying to like drive you through the mat

40:15.360 --> 40:16.280
 and through the ground.

40:16.280 --> 40:20.600
 Like I took, like, it gave me joy to do that.

40:20.600 --> 40:23.200
 Like, it wasn't like I was trying to, you know,

40:23.200 --> 40:25.600
 just return you to the mat so that I could pin you.

40:25.600 --> 40:26.920
 That what you just talked about,

40:26.920 --> 40:28.880
 like the dominating another person,

40:28.880 --> 40:30.920
 I used to look at that as you've got someone

40:30.920 --> 40:32.280
 who in theory is equally trained

40:32.280 --> 40:34.080
 and equally skilled as you are.

40:34.080 --> 40:38.320
 And you're absolutely out there totally dominating them.

40:38.320 --> 40:39.880
 There's joy in that.

40:39.880 --> 40:41.800
 You could get in an MMA fight

40:41.800 --> 40:44.920
 and you could take someone down and you could mount them.

40:44.920 --> 40:47.160
 And all that feels great.

40:47.160 --> 40:49.160
 But when you start raining down the punches

40:49.160 --> 40:52.000
 on their face from mount and like dropping elbows and stuff,

40:52.000 --> 40:55.080
 like there's another level of satisfaction there.

40:55.080 --> 40:57.440
 And it's tough to describe.

40:57.440 --> 41:01.320
 And I don't think that everyone is made for it.

41:01.320 --> 41:03.920
 When I was, I think when I was a senior in high school,

41:03.920 --> 41:05.480
 my wrestling coach said, look,

41:05.480 --> 41:09.160
 you've got to stop with all this crazy aggressive wrestling.

41:09.160 --> 41:12.080
 Like they tried to turn me into a technician

41:12.080 --> 41:15.240
 and it did work to a degree.

41:15.240 --> 41:18.760
 And it was a humongous shift for me in terms of success,

41:18.760 --> 41:22.400
 but it wasn't the same level of enjoyment out of it.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.920
 Like, I mean, I got disqualified from New England

41:25.920 --> 41:28.080
 because my coach said cross face and I cross face

41:28.080 --> 41:29.040
 and he said harder.

41:29.040 --> 41:31.400
 And I basically wound up and blasted a kid in the face

41:31.400 --> 41:33.760
 and his nose got busted everywhere.

41:33.760 --> 41:37.360
 But I didn't think not to do it because that felt good.

41:37.360 --> 41:39.560
 It felt good to cross face him like that.

41:39.560 --> 41:41.360
 I was a lot of like.

41:42.600 --> 41:46.560
 That's a weird American warrior ethos that I've picked up,

41:46.560 --> 41:49.920
 but I also have in me the Russian, the Setyaev brothers

41:49.920 --> 41:53.720
 that don't see it, don't see it as that.

41:53.720 --> 41:55.280
 They don't get draw,

41:56.480 --> 42:00.480
 they think that there is a tension between the art

42:00.480 --> 42:04.520
 of the martial art and the violence of the martial art.

42:04.520 --> 42:05.360
 I agree with that.

42:05.360 --> 42:06.840
 It's a poetic way I could put it,

42:06.840 --> 42:10.200
 but they're not so fascinated with this Dan Gable

42:10.200 --> 42:12.040
 dominating another human.

42:12.040 --> 42:17.040
 They think of the effortlessness of the technique

42:18.760 --> 42:20.600
 and your mastery of the art is exhibited

42:20.600 --> 42:22.360
 in its effortlessness,

42:22.360 --> 42:25.080
 how much you lose yourself in the moment and the timing,

42:25.080 --> 42:27.200
 that just the beauty of a timing.

42:27.200 --> 42:30.480
 Like there's much more, like one example in judo,

42:30.480 --> 42:33.920
 but also in wrestling, you can look at the foot sweep.

42:33.920 --> 42:38.320
 Wrestlers in America and even judo players in America

42:38.320 --> 42:40.840
 and much of the world don't admire the beauty

42:40.840 --> 42:43.680
 of the foot sweep, but a well timed foot sweep,

42:43.680 --> 42:45.760
 which is a way to sort of off balance

42:45.760 --> 42:48.720
 to find the right timing to just effortlessly

42:50.280 --> 42:53.800
 change the table, turn the tables of,

42:53.800 --> 42:58.480
 I mean, dominate your opponent is seen as the highest form

42:58.480 --> 43:00.840
 of mastery in Russian wrestling.

43:00.840 --> 43:04.280
 In the case of judo, it's in Japanese judo.

43:04.280 --> 43:05.160
 It's interesting.

43:05.160 --> 43:06.000
 I'm not sure.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.560
 I'm not sure what that tension is about.

43:08.560 --> 43:11.000
 I think it actually takes me back to,

43:11.880 --> 43:13.720
 I don't know if you listened to Dan Carlin,

43:13.720 --> 43:17.360
 Hardcore History and Genghis Khan, if you've ever.

43:17.360 --> 43:19.640
 I've read a great, great book.

43:19.640 --> 43:20.480
 On Genghis Khan?

43:20.480 --> 43:21.320
 Yeah.

43:21.320 --> 43:23.200
 I'm still trying to adjust.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.440
 Most of my life said Genghis Khan,

43:25.440 --> 43:30.440
 but the right pronunciation is actually Genghis Khan.

43:31.080 --> 43:32.920
 There's a tension there.

43:32.920 --> 43:35.120
 We kind of think, I don't know we,

43:35.120 --> 43:40.120
 I kind of thought as Genghis Khan is a ultra violent,

43:41.440 --> 43:45.920
 a leader of ultra violent men, but another view,

43:45.920 --> 43:50.920
 another way to see them is the people who warriors

43:50.920 --> 43:55.920
 that valued extreme competence and mastery of the art

43:58.600 --> 44:00.920
 of fighting with weapons, with bows,

44:00.920 --> 44:03.480
 with the horse riding, all that kind of stuff.

44:03.480 --> 44:07.480
 And I'm not sure exactly where to place them

44:07.480 --> 44:12.480
 on my sort of thinking about violence in our human history.

44:12.800 --> 44:16.880
 I think in the context of like combat sports,

44:16.880 --> 44:19.080
 I think there's a difference between an athlete

44:19.080 --> 44:22.280
 winning a contest under a certain set of rules

44:22.280 --> 44:26.280
 and a fighter winning a fight under those exact same rules.

44:26.280 --> 44:28.400
 There's a different approach to it.

44:28.400 --> 44:31.000
 And I don't think one is any better than the other.

44:32.080 --> 44:34.480
 Like in MMA, I think a great example would be

44:35.560 --> 44:37.000
 George St. Pierre.

44:37.000 --> 44:40.120
 George St. Pierre is a tremendous athlete

44:40.120 --> 44:43.440
 and he considers himself to be a martial artist first.

44:43.440 --> 44:45.960
 He's trying to win an athletic competition.

44:45.960 --> 44:49.560
 Like Nick Diaz is trying to bust your ass, right?

44:49.560 --> 44:51.360
 There's a different approach to it.

44:51.360 --> 44:53.200
 And yes, they've had different results

44:53.200 --> 44:55.400
 at the highest level of competition,

44:55.400 --> 44:59.040
 but it's difficult to attribute the difference in results

44:59.040 --> 45:00.520
 just to their approach to the sport

45:00.520 --> 45:01.680
 because they're different human beings

45:01.680 --> 45:05.080
 with different abilities and different physical attributes.

45:06.960 --> 45:09.640
 The PsyTF brothers have that luxury of being able

45:09.640 --> 45:14.360
 to talk about the beauty of a perfectly timed slide by.

45:14.360 --> 45:16.120
 There are other wrestlers that will never be able

45:16.120 --> 45:18.760
 to pull that off and therefore they have to pursue

45:18.760 --> 45:20.960
 other ways to defeat someone.

45:20.960 --> 45:24.040
 And maybe it is the Dan Gable breaking a man's spirit

45:24.040 --> 45:25.400
 by outworking him type thing,

45:25.400 --> 45:27.480
 which is beautiful in its own way.

45:28.720 --> 45:33.240
 But we tend to self select the ways in which

45:33.240 --> 45:35.000
 we're able to be successful

45:35.000 --> 45:37.440
 and then kind of take a deep dive into that.

45:37.440 --> 45:39.760
 What do you think is more beautiful?

45:39.760 --> 45:44.760
 Brute force or effortless execution

45:46.440 --> 45:49.560
 of a technique that dominates another human?

45:49.560 --> 45:52.160
 I think it's a subjective thing

45:52.160 --> 45:55.360
 based on what skills you perceive yourself to have.

45:55.360 --> 45:59.720
 I'm never, I've never been a slick, super athletic,

45:59.720 --> 46:02.400
 dexterous competitor in anything.

46:02.400 --> 46:04.320
 And I've always been more of an,

46:04.320 --> 46:06.080
 I've gotta outwork you, I've gotta out grind you,

46:06.080 --> 46:07.400
 I gotta out mean you.

46:07.400 --> 46:09.520
 And so because I've lived that,

46:09.520 --> 46:11.520
 I tend to see the beauty in that more

46:11.520 --> 46:13.680
 because I have a perceptual awareness

46:13.680 --> 46:16.480
 that I don't have for the people who have the luxury

46:16.480 --> 46:18.080
 of being very slick and athletic

46:18.080 --> 46:20.760
 and using beautiful technique.

46:20.760 --> 46:23.800
 Now that said, there's a phenomenal little video

46:23.800 --> 46:28.800
 the other day I sent to a friend of a compilation

46:29.040 --> 46:32.000
 of foot sweeps by Leota Machida in MMA.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.800
 And they're so beautiful and they're so awesome.

46:34.800 --> 46:38.040
 And it's not that I don't have an appreciation for those,

46:38.040 --> 46:39.840
 but I can't emulate those because I lack

46:39.840 --> 46:42.520
 the physical ability to do that.

46:42.520 --> 46:46.280
 Whereas I at least have a chance to emulate

46:46.280 --> 46:48.760
 some of the people who do it through grit

46:48.760 --> 46:51.040
 and through outworking people.

46:51.040 --> 46:54.400
 But I would love to return to Genghis Khan

46:54.400 --> 46:56.680
 and get your thoughts about,

46:56.680 --> 46:59.400
 like I have so many mixed feelings

46:59.400 --> 47:04.400
 about whether he is evil or not,

47:04.400 --> 47:09.400
 whether the violence that he brought to the world

47:09.880 --> 47:12.840
 had ultimately, the fact that it had maybe

47:14.440 --> 47:16.800
 kind of like Dan Carlin describes,

47:16.800 --> 47:19.280
 cleanse the landscape.

47:19.280 --> 47:22.160
 It's like a reset for the world through violence

47:22.160 --> 47:27.160
 had ultimately a progressive effect on human civilization,

47:29.640 --> 47:33.680
 even though in the short term it led to massive,

47:33.680 --> 47:36.160
 you could say suffering.

47:36.160 --> 47:38.360
 I don't know what to make of that, man.

47:38.360 --> 47:40.680
 What are your thoughts on Genghis Khan?

47:40.680 --> 47:44.400
 I think it's always difficult to look at a historical figure

47:44.400 --> 47:48.120
 and their actions of their time through a modern day lens

47:48.120 --> 47:53.120
 because it's easy for us to kind of impugn

47:54.480 --> 47:56.720
 their achievements and the things that they did

47:56.720 --> 48:00.600
 and say, oh, well, what he did was wrong.

48:00.600 --> 48:02.720
 Well, of course that can be true,

48:02.720 --> 48:04.680
 but a lot of times we don't actually have

48:04.680 --> 48:06.960
 any real good context or concept

48:06.960 --> 48:09.520
 of the times they were living in

48:09.520 --> 48:11.920
 and what really was deemed wrong and what really wasn't.

48:11.920 --> 48:14.160
 We're looking at it through a very cushy modern lens.

48:14.160 --> 48:18.560
 That being said, from what I've read about Genghis Khan,

48:18.560 --> 48:19.760
 yeah, he was a violent dude,

48:19.760 --> 48:21.280
 but also he gave you an option.

48:22.360 --> 48:24.040
 When he got to a village, he said,

48:24.040 --> 48:29.040
 look, you have a choice,

48:29.120 --> 48:31.680
 you can come with us or you can run.

48:31.680 --> 48:36.440
 And he gave them an option to join his legion of fighters

48:36.440 --> 48:38.080
 who he took very good care of.

48:38.080 --> 48:41.200
 He was the first military leader

48:41.200 --> 48:45.600
 to pay his soldiers families when they died.

48:45.600 --> 48:48.720
 And he did that based on the booty that they got

48:48.720 --> 48:50.840
 when they raided a village.

48:50.840 --> 48:52.480
 He took that money, he took his share

48:52.480 --> 48:54.080
 and they divided that up amongst the soldiers

48:54.080 --> 48:55.560
 and then the soldiers families.

48:55.560 --> 49:02.560
 I think he also is credited with first horseback mail routes

49:02.560 --> 49:03.720
 or something like that, right?

49:03.720 --> 49:06.680
 Isn't he the godfather of the modern postal system?

49:06.680 --> 49:08.080
 There's something like that.

49:08.080 --> 49:13.080
 Yeah, he's the Bernie Sanders of the Mongol Empire.

49:14.520 --> 49:18.920
 I do think the offering of surrender is an interesting one

49:18.920 --> 49:23.920
 because it's interesting as a thought experiment,

49:23.920 --> 49:26.040
 whether you would sacrifice your way of,

49:26.040 --> 49:28.640
 like the pride of nations or the nationalism,

49:28.640 --> 49:30.000
 pride of your country,

49:30.000 --> 49:35.000
 whether you're willing to give that up to survive.

49:38.120 --> 49:40.600
 It depends on who depends on you.

49:40.600 --> 49:44.520
 If you have a family and young kids and stuff like that,

49:44.520 --> 49:47.600
 I think your obligation is primarily to them

49:47.600 --> 49:49.560
 and therefore surrender has to be something

49:49.560 --> 49:52.400
 that you consider in that moment in time

49:52.400 --> 49:55.480
 so that you can take care of those people.

49:55.480 --> 49:57.680
 If you're a man alone and you've got all these principles

49:57.680 --> 50:00.240
 and all this other stuff and you're not down

50:00.240 --> 50:02.640
 with what Genghis Khan is doing and what he's selling,

50:02.640 --> 50:04.320
 yeah, try and escape, do your thing

50:04.320 --> 50:06.920
 and just know what waits on the other side of that

50:06.920 --> 50:08.080
 for you potentially.

50:08.080 --> 50:09.960
 But I think if there's someone else out there

50:09.960 --> 50:13.120
 that depends on you, your obligation should be to them.

50:13.120 --> 50:17.640
 It feels like historically people valued principles

50:17.640 --> 50:22.640
 more than life in this weight of like,

50:22.720 --> 50:23.840
 what do I value more?

50:23.840 --> 50:26.520
 The principles I hold versus survival.

50:26.520 --> 50:30.280
 It seems that now we don't value principles as much.

50:30.280 --> 50:31.760
 Principles could be also religion,

50:31.760 --> 50:33.720
 it could be your values, whatever.

50:33.720 --> 50:36.520
 We're okay sort of sacrificing those

50:36.520 --> 50:38.680
 for to preserve our survival.

50:38.680 --> 50:42.040
 And that applies in all forms like actual survival

50:42.040 --> 50:46.920
 or like on social media, like preserving your reputation,

50:46.920 --> 50:48.480
 all those kinds of things.

50:48.480 --> 50:52.720
 It seems like we, especially in America,

50:52.720 --> 50:57.240
 value individual life,

50:57.240 --> 51:00.560
 that death is somehow a really bad thing.

51:00.560 --> 51:04.120
 As opposed to saying sacrificing your principles

51:04.120 --> 51:06.800
 is a very bad thing and everybody dies

51:06.800 --> 51:08.840
 and it's okay to die.

51:08.840 --> 51:12.120
 What's horrible is to sacrifice your principles

51:12.120 --> 51:15.880
 of who you are just to live another day.

51:15.880 --> 51:17.840
 I think a big problem is people don't really even know

51:17.840 --> 51:19.600
 what their principles are anymore.

51:19.600 --> 51:24.600
 People, social media and just the way that we live nowadays

51:26.080 --> 51:29.320
 where we're separated from the human contact like this,

51:29.320 --> 51:33.480
 like you're not contacting people in a community anymore.

51:33.480 --> 51:35.840
 You're not, whether you're religious or not,

51:35.840 --> 51:37.800
 like you're not congregating at a church,

51:37.800 --> 51:39.000
 you're not part of a parish

51:39.000 --> 51:41.160
 like you would be like in down South,

51:41.160 --> 51:44.080
 you're not part of that community anymore.

51:44.080 --> 51:48.440
 And so it's difficult to figure out

51:48.440 --> 51:50.360
 what your principles and values are

51:50.360 --> 51:52.560
 because you're constantly jumping from one bucket

51:52.560 --> 51:55.360
 to the next online.

51:55.360 --> 51:58.160
 And you don't get a lot of like direct,

51:58.160 --> 52:01.160
 like reasonable feedback from people.

52:01.160 --> 52:02.640
 You just get dipshit feedback.

52:02.640 --> 52:03.880
 Like, oh, you don't believe this?

52:03.880 --> 52:04.960
 Well, you're a jerk.

52:04.960 --> 52:07.680
 I think the hard thing currently

52:07.680 --> 52:09.440
 is having the integrity and character

52:09.440 --> 52:11.280
 to stick by principles one under.

52:11.280 --> 52:15.720
 I don't want to equate murder in the Genghis Khan times

52:15.720 --> 52:19.040
 to social media cancel culture,

52:19.040 --> 52:20.800
 but it certainly doesn't feel good

52:20.800 --> 52:22.840
 when people are attacking on social media.

52:22.840 --> 52:25.720
 And it does take a lot of integrity to,

52:26.840 --> 52:28.960
 without anger, without emotion,

52:28.960 --> 52:33.960
 without mocking others or attacking others unfairly,

52:34.680 --> 52:38.920
 standing by the ideas you hold,

52:38.920 --> 52:43.920
 or in another way, standing by your friends,

52:45.160 --> 52:47.160
 standing by this little group,

52:47.160 --> 52:51.760
 like loyalty of the people that you know are good people.

52:51.760 --> 52:54.200
 I find that in cancel culture,

52:54.200 --> 52:57.120
 one of the sad things is whenever somebody gets

52:57.120 --> 52:59.240
 quote unquote canceled,

52:59.240 --> 53:02.640
 everybody just gets all their friends become really quiet

53:02.640 --> 53:06.280
 and don't defend them or worse.

53:06.280 --> 53:08.960
 I mean, quiet is at least understandable.

53:08.960 --> 53:12.960
 They kind of signal that they throw them out of the bus,

53:12.960 --> 53:14.960
 I guess is one way to put it.

53:14.960 --> 53:18.360
 And that's something I think about a lot

53:18.360 --> 53:20.540
 because from coming from me, it's like,

53:22.240 --> 53:23.880
 I hold an ethic.

53:23.880 --> 53:25.480
 I don't know if others hold this ethic.

53:25.480 --> 53:30.480
 Maybe it's this like Russian mobster ethic of like,

53:30.480 --> 53:34.440
 you should help your friends bury the body.

53:34.440 --> 53:36.680
 You shouldn't criticize your friends for committing

53:36.680 --> 53:37.560
 the murder.

53:37.560 --> 53:39.440
 Like there are certain levels of like,

53:40.680 --> 53:43.880
 yeah, you have that discussion after you buried the body

53:43.880 --> 53:47.360
 that like maybe you shouldn't have done that murder thing.

53:47.360 --> 53:50.880
 I don't know, I understand that that's a problematic,

53:51.880 --> 53:54.320
 what's the terminology?

53:54.320 --> 53:57.120
 That's a problematic ethical framework

53:57.120 --> 53:58.080
 within which to operate.

53:58.080 --> 54:00.880
 But at the same time, it feels like what else do we have

54:00.880 --> 54:04.240
 in this world except the brotherhood, the sisterhood,

54:04.240 --> 54:06.600
 the love we have for a very small community.

54:06.600 --> 54:08.200
 But perhaps that's the wrong way of thinking.

54:08.200 --> 54:11.240
 Perhaps the 21st century would be defined

54:11.240 --> 54:13.180
 by the dissipation of this community,

54:13.180 --> 54:14.880
 of this loyalty concept.

54:14.880 --> 54:16.560
 No, we're all just individuals.

54:16.560 --> 54:17.400
 I think you're right.

54:17.400 --> 54:20.080
 And I think you have to have some sort of core framework

54:20.080 --> 54:22.840
 of principles and beliefs that you operate on.

54:22.840 --> 54:26.880
 And I think what I was referencing is a little bit different.

54:26.880 --> 54:28.960
 But to speak to your point,

54:28.960 --> 54:33.960
 you need a framework of core principles

54:34.360 --> 54:38.440
 on which you can then base a lot of your other decisions.

54:38.440 --> 54:40.480
 Like I believe these three things to be true,

54:40.480 --> 54:41.480
 whatever they are,

54:41.480 --> 54:43.400
 and that will help inform other decisions

54:43.400 --> 54:44.500
 you make in your life.

54:45.600 --> 54:48.980
 As far as how you treat your friends,

54:48.980 --> 54:52.560
 I've got probably three friends that,

54:52.560 --> 54:53.880
 if they called me right now and said,

54:53.880 --> 54:56.460
 let's bury the body, sorry, Lex, I gotta go.

54:56.460 --> 55:00.700
 There are other people in my life that if they said,

55:00.700 --> 55:02.420
 hey, we've got to go bury the body,

55:02.420 --> 55:03.660
 I would say, who is this?

55:06.700 --> 55:09.980
 So I think it depends on the relationship.

55:09.980 --> 55:12.180
 I wonder if that's a good, that's a really good measure.

55:12.180 --> 55:14.100
 I would love to have,

55:14.100 --> 55:15.980
 I would love that to be in your profile.

55:15.980 --> 55:17.620
 People put like pronouns.

55:17.620 --> 55:22.220
 I would love to put like, honestly, like objectively,

55:22.220 --> 55:24.820
 not self report, but objective,

55:24.820 --> 55:28.380
 how many people in your life, if they committed murder,

55:28.380 --> 55:29.820
 you would not ask any questions

55:29.820 --> 55:31.900
 and you would help them hide the body.

55:31.900 --> 55:33.940
 Like, I would love to know that number for people.

55:33.940 --> 55:35.900
 Yeah, and I think it's a weird thing too,

55:35.900 --> 55:37.620
 because you think right away, like, okay,

55:37.620 --> 55:39.920
 it must be the group of people that are the closest to you.

55:39.920 --> 55:41.860
 That's who you're first thinking of, right?

55:41.860 --> 55:44.140
 But obviously for like my best friend,

55:44.140 --> 55:45.820
 I would do it, no question about it.

55:45.820 --> 55:47.660
 But I've got other people that are close to me

55:47.660 --> 55:50.580
 that are close to me in other ways.

55:50.580 --> 55:52.100
 And I probably wouldn't do that only

55:52.100 --> 55:54.220
 because I don't think they'd do it for me.

55:54.220 --> 55:55.060
 Yeah.

55:55.060 --> 55:57.660
 And that is a consideration.

55:57.660 --> 55:59.900
 So I guess, is the principle there

55:59.900 --> 56:02.020
 then that you do for your friends

56:02.020 --> 56:03.420
 what you think they would do for you?

56:03.420 --> 56:05.260
 Is that the underlying principle?

56:05.260 --> 56:06.900
 Or do you just have a blind loyalty

56:06.900 --> 56:10.540
 to people in your life for different reasons?

56:10.540 --> 56:12.700
 I got people that are not on my inner circle

56:12.700 --> 56:15.740
 that I probably wouldn't help change a tire

56:15.740 --> 56:17.340
 at two in the morning if they're on the highway.

56:17.340 --> 56:18.340
 But if they called me and said,

56:18.340 --> 56:20.780
 hey, we gotta bury the body, I might show up for that.

56:20.780 --> 56:22.420
 It's just these weird different connections you have.

56:22.420 --> 56:23.340
 Yeah, it's fascinating.

56:23.340 --> 56:25.980
 Yeah, I have close friends that like,

56:25.980 --> 56:28.460
 I'd probably be, exactly, the tire is a good example.

56:28.460 --> 56:31.460
 I'd be like, can't you find somebody else to do this?

56:31.460 --> 56:35.980
 I think part of that is just this leap of faith

56:35.980 --> 56:39.900
 into like giving yourself to the other person

56:39.900 --> 56:43.820
 that creates a deep connection

56:43.820 --> 56:48.820
 that makes life fulfilling, like meaningful

56:49.140 --> 56:51.580
 that doesn't exist if you don't take that leap.

56:51.580 --> 56:52.820
 I mean, it's not about the murder.

56:52.820 --> 56:53.900
 We're sort of focusing.

56:53.900 --> 56:57.060
 I think that's a, I think you have to,

56:57.060 --> 56:59.020
 what is it, cross that bridge when you get there.

56:59.020 --> 57:00.060
 I'm not exactly sure.

57:00.060 --> 57:01.820
 This is just a thought experiment.

57:01.820 --> 57:05.140
 But it's, I think about that a lot,

57:05.140 --> 57:06.700
 especially these COVID times.

57:06.700 --> 57:09.420
 And as like people become more and more isolated

57:09.420 --> 57:11.060
 and separated from each other,

57:11.060 --> 57:14.780
 like how important is it to have those deep connections

57:14.780 --> 57:16.420
 to other humans?

57:16.420 --> 57:18.540
 I think especially like what you're talking about there.

57:18.540 --> 57:20.220
 Have you ever seen the movie, The Town?

57:20.220 --> 57:21.500
 There's a great line in the movie

57:21.500 --> 57:23.420
 where one of the main characters

57:23.420 --> 57:26.340
 walks into his friend's house and he says,

57:26.340 --> 57:27.380
 I need your help.

57:28.380 --> 57:29.860
 We're gonna go hurt some people

57:29.860 --> 57:31.900
 and you can never ask me about it again.

57:31.900 --> 57:33.340
 And the friend looks up and he says,

57:33.340 --> 57:34.540
 whose car are we taking?

57:35.620 --> 57:38.180
 Like that is the type of person you need in your life.

57:38.180 --> 57:40.180
 And the people, like there are people

57:40.180 --> 57:41.980
 that will walk through that door and say that to you

57:41.980 --> 57:43.340
 and you drop everything you're doing.

57:43.340 --> 57:44.700
 And then there's the people that walk through your door

57:44.700 --> 57:45.660
 and you're like, you know what?

57:45.660 --> 57:47.460
 I got a hot pocket in the microwave.

57:49.460 --> 57:50.860
 I'm a little bit tied up right now,

57:50.860 --> 57:52.060
 but I'd love to help you out.

57:52.060 --> 57:54.500
 But you know, I don't wanna do that.

57:54.500 --> 57:57.220
 And you don't have that deep connection with those people.

57:57.220 --> 57:58.980
 You mentioned some principles

57:58.980 --> 58:02.340
 that you've changed your mind on.

58:02.340 --> 58:04.740
 Is there, do you wanna go there?

58:04.740 --> 58:07.620
 Is there some interesting principles

58:07.620 --> 58:11.940
 and the process of changing that is useful to talk about?

58:11.940 --> 58:14.420
 I can't really cite a specific thing,

58:14.420 --> 58:18.700
 except that understanding that the principles

58:18.700 --> 58:20.740
 that you have at different points in your life

58:20.740 --> 58:22.460
 can change and it's okay to change them

58:22.460 --> 58:23.620
 without being a total pussy

58:23.620 --> 58:25.140
 and being bullied by other people

58:25.140 --> 58:27.180
 into thinking what you thought was wrong.

58:27.180 --> 58:30.420
 If you come to these conclusions of your own volition

58:30.420 --> 58:32.220
 and you decide to change them, that's great.

58:32.220 --> 58:36.300
 And it can be really, it can be really liberating.

58:36.300 --> 58:38.100
 It's really liberating to have an idea

58:38.100 --> 58:43.100
 that you hold so true to your core belief system

58:45.220 --> 58:47.980
 and then to actually have someone change your mind for you

58:47.980 --> 58:50.780
 and be okay with it, as opposed to being like, no,

58:50.780 --> 58:52.500
 I gotta die with this.

58:52.500 --> 58:53.340
 I gotta die with this.

58:53.340 --> 58:54.180
 It's really liberating.

58:54.180 --> 58:56.020
 There are definitely are ideas you wanna die on that hill

58:56.020 --> 58:58.340
 and no one's ever gonna change your mind.

58:58.340 --> 59:02.100
 But it's really liberating to be confident enough

59:02.100 --> 59:03.940
 to say, change my mind.

59:03.940 --> 59:06.380
 I'm lucky enough to have some smart motherfuckers around me

59:06.380 --> 59:10.060
 who can tell me, listen, you're being a total dipshit.

59:10.060 --> 59:12.380
 Like let's rethink this.

59:12.380 --> 59:15.380
 Or like I have one friend who does the five whys all the time

59:15.380 --> 59:17.300
 and he loves backing me into a corner.

59:17.300 --> 59:18.140
 And.

59:18.140 --> 59:19.060
 What's the five whys?

59:19.060 --> 59:20.940
 You just, like when someone makes a statement

59:20.940 --> 59:24.100
 about something, to really get to the core issue,

59:24.100 --> 59:27.940
 they say, if you ask why five times, make a statement,

59:27.940 --> 59:29.140
 well, why is that?

59:29.140 --> 59:30.820
 And you answer that, well, why?

59:30.820 --> 59:32.700
 And you phrase the whys differently, obviously,

59:32.700 --> 59:33.820
 but then you get to the core.

59:33.820 --> 59:36.660
 They say five times, you can get to the core of the issue.

59:36.660 --> 59:38.220
 And that's a challenging thing.

59:38.220 --> 59:41.460
 But I find later in life, it's so liberating for me

59:41.460 --> 59:43.500
 to be confident enough to be like,

59:43.500 --> 59:46.820
 man, was I fucking way off the mark on this

59:46.820 --> 59:48.060
 and have my mind changed.

59:48.060 --> 59:50.780
 And be able to say that to others that I was wrong.

59:50.780 --> 59:51.740
 Totally.

59:51.740 --> 59:54.980
 That ability, and I never used to have that.

59:54.980 --> 59:58.300
 And it feels real good.

59:58.300 --> 59:59.940
 And there's a hunger for that too.

1:00:00.900 --> 1:00:03.260
 Yeah, you're so right, actually, on a personal level,

1:00:03.260 --> 1:00:05.180
 it feels very good.

1:00:05.180 --> 1:00:07.420
 Exactly as you said, it's liberating

1:00:07.420 --> 1:00:10.860
 because you're free to then think as opposed to.

1:00:10.860 --> 1:00:11.700
 Defend.

1:00:11.700 --> 1:00:14.020
 Yeah, without thinking.

1:00:14.020 --> 1:00:16.580
 Yeah, you get so sick of defending the same thing

1:00:16.580 --> 1:00:18.060
 over and over and over.

1:00:18.060 --> 1:00:20.700
 And you start to think about it and it's like,

1:00:20.700 --> 1:00:25.380
 well, I would really like to evolve my thought process here.

1:00:25.380 --> 1:00:29.020
 And when you're constantly defending one point,

1:00:29.020 --> 1:00:31.380
 it's difficult to let other ideas in.

1:00:31.380 --> 1:00:34.700
 You discount the possibility

1:00:34.700 --> 1:00:35.940
 that you can have your mind changed

1:00:35.940 --> 1:00:37.740
 when you're constantly on the defense.

1:00:37.740 --> 1:00:39.980
 You have to have a crack in the front line

1:00:39.980 --> 1:00:43.380
 in order to let a new idea come in and possibly flourish.

1:00:43.380 --> 1:00:46.900
 And maybe the new idea doesn't even prove your current

1:00:46.900 --> 1:00:48.340
 belief system to be wrong,

1:00:48.340 --> 1:00:51.940
 but maybe it's like the water to a seed and it grows

1:00:51.940 --> 1:00:54.180
 and now it's something even bigger and better.

1:00:54.180 --> 1:00:57.060
 And you can start to work with that instead.

1:00:57.060 --> 1:00:59.780
 And it's a tough thing because I'm a stubborn fuck

1:00:59.780 --> 1:01:03.140
 and it's very difficult for me, it was historically,

1:01:03.140 --> 1:01:05.060
 to say I was wrong about this one,

1:01:05.060 --> 1:01:06.420
 or I messed this one up,

1:01:06.420 --> 1:01:08.740
 or I wish I could have that one back.

1:01:09.660 --> 1:01:11.820
 There's a public figure for me thing too,

1:01:11.820 --> 1:01:16.180
 which there's a difference between changing your mind

1:01:16.180 --> 1:01:17.700
 with a small circle of friends

1:01:17.700 --> 1:01:20.740
 and changing your mind publicly about something,

1:01:20.740 --> 1:01:23.740
 but it has equal, one echoes the other.

1:01:23.740 --> 1:01:25.180
 It is equally liberating,

1:01:25.180 --> 1:01:30.180
 but people will not make that change easy,

1:01:31.300 --> 1:01:32.420
 but it doesn't matter.

1:01:32.420 --> 1:01:34.180
 That's the point.

1:01:35.500 --> 1:01:38.540
 I think it's ultimately liberating as a human being,

1:01:38.540 --> 1:01:43.540
 public figure or not to just think deeply about this world

1:01:43.580 --> 1:01:47.020
 and to keep changing, which is like,

1:01:47.020 --> 1:01:49.140
 I think there's a deep hunger for that

1:01:49.140 --> 1:01:51.060
 in like political discourse,

1:01:51.060 --> 1:01:55.460
 that people are so tribal currently about politics

1:01:55.460 --> 1:01:58.100
 that they want to see somebody who says,

1:01:58.100 --> 1:02:00.860
 you know what, I changed my mind on this.

1:02:00.860 --> 1:02:03.820
 And then keep changing their mind and keep asking questions,

1:02:03.820 --> 1:02:05.340
 keep showing that they're open minded,

1:02:05.340 --> 1:02:06.180
 all that kind of stuff.

1:02:06.180 --> 1:02:10.100
 But when you want someone in a position of political power

1:02:10.100 --> 1:02:12.340
 to change their mind because they realize

1:02:12.340 --> 1:02:13.700
 that there might be a better way,

1:02:13.700 --> 1:02:15.980
 not because they realize that by changing their mind,

1:02:15.980 --> 1:02:18.100
 they're gonna get a new demographic to vote for them.

1:02:18.100 --> 1:02:19.660
 Like that's transparent as shit.

1:02:19.660 --> 1:02:21.020
 Nobody wants to see that.

1:02:21.020 --> 1:02:26.020
 Like that's a person who can't separate their position

1:02:26.020 --> 1:02:27.660
 from their people they're supposed to be helping.

1:02:27.660 --> 1:02:29.140
 Yeah, and you can usually smell that.

1:02:29.140 --> 1:02:34.140
 That's, we're just talking offline about,

1:02:34.140 --> 1:02:36.140
 there's something about Hillary Clinton

1:02:36.140 --> 1:02:40.380
 where she talked about changing her mind on gay marriage

1:02:40.380 --> 1:02:44.900
 that it felt like this is a political calculation

1:02:44.900 --> 1:02:47.980
 versus like really deeply thinking about like,

1:02:47.980 --> 1:02:52.980
 what things do we do in this world

1:02:53.060 --> 1:02:55.060
 that violate basic human rights?

1:02:55.060 --> 1:02:56.900
 Like really thinking about deeply.

1:02:56.900 --> 1:03:00.380
 And of course politicians are calculating this,

1:03:00.380 --> 1:03:01.700
 but you can see it.

1:03:01.700 --> 1:03:02.540
 This is the thing.

1:03:02.540 --> 1:03:06.220
 That's why I like on the human level,

1:03:06.220 --> 1:03:08.800
 there's like political policies, but there's also humans.

1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:11.320
 And I've always liked Bernie Sanders, for example.

1:03:11.320 --> 1:03:13.680
 I don't know, not the later perhaps Bernie Sanders,

1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:15.540
 but I used to listen to him back in the day.

1:03:15.540 --> 1:03:18.820
 And it felt that people might disagree with me,

1:03:18.820 --> 1:03:22.300
 but it felt like there was a real human struggling

1:03:22.300 --> 1:03:25.500
 with ideas, whatever, agree with him or not,

1:03:25.500 --> 1:03:27.860
 it felt like he wasn't doing political calculation.

1:03:27.860 --> 1:03:28.740
 He was just a human.

1:03:28.740 --> 1:03:32.180
 He couldn't be further away from my political ideals,

1:03:32.180 --> 1:03:36.180
 but also like, there's an obvious authenticity

1:03:36.180 --> 1:03:38.540
 to his passion for what he's saying

1:03:38.540 --> 1:03:40.780
 that is not present in other candidates.

1:03:40.780 --> 1:03:42.260
 And you could see it,

1:03:42.260 --> 1:03:44.500
 all these people that have been in politics forever,

1:03:44.500 --> 1:03:45.820
 like from all the way back

1:03:45.820 --> 1:03:47.860
 when Hillary was a lawyer in the 70s.

1:03:47.860 --> 1:03:49.700
 There's a couple of shots of her in a courtroom

1:03:49.700 --> 1:03:52.500
 in the 70s though, she's looking all right.

1:03:52.500 --> 1:03:53.980
 She's got those big glasses on.

1:03:53.980 --> 1:03:57.220
 She's kind of a little bit of a nerdy babe back in the day.

1:03:57.220 --> 1:03:58.380
 Oh, you mean like.

1:03:58.380 --> 1:03:59.220
 Yeah.

1:03:59.220 --> 1:04:03.460
 Well, John Clark says Hillary Clinton was a babe

1:04:03.460 --> 1:04:04.300
 back in the day.

1:04:04.300 --> 1:04:05.620
 73 Clinton, yeah.

1:04:05.620 --> 1:04:10.620
 That's an interesting question

1:04:10.660 --> 1:04:12.300
 about authenticity in politicians.

1:04:12.300 --> 1:04:15.300
 Do you think like Hillary Clinton,

1:04:15.300 --> 1:04:17.340
 just the Clintons in general are a good example

1:04:17.340 --> 1:04:21.700
 that why do you think they become over time so inauthentic?

1:04:21.700 --> 1:04:23.420
 Is it the system that changes them?

1:04:23.420 --> 1:04:25.460
 Is it their own hunger for power?

1:04:25.460 --> 1:04:29.860
 Is it, what is it, or are they always inauthentic?

1:04:29.860 --> 1:04:31.300
 Well, first I'd like to say that,

1:04:31.300 --> 1:04:32.140
 I don't know if you know this,

1:04:32.140 --> 1:04:35.820
 but I come from a bit of a political dynasty myself.

1:04:36.740 --> 1:04:38.900
 I was on the student government several times

1:04:38.900 --> 1:04:42.220
 in high school and my dad won the runoff

1:04:42.220 --> 1:04:45.260
 in a special election in Bradenton Beach, Florida.

1:04:45.260 --> 1:04:47.540
 I think there's like 700 people there.

1:04:47.540 --> 1:04:48.380
 So.

1:04:48.380 --> 1:04:49.660
 So your dad got you the job?

1:04:49.660 --> 1:04:51.660
 Yeah, we're basically,

1:04:51.660 --> 1:04:54.100
 a lot of people compare us to the Kennedys.

1:04:54.100 --> 1:04:56.540
 My guess with the politicians is that,

1:04:56.540 --> 1:04:59.700
 and you can see it now as we're becoming more cognizant

1:04:59.700 --> 1:05:02.140
 as people to the political process,

1:05:02.140 --> 1:05:04.300
 I think the process corrupts people.

1:05:04.300 --> 1:05:06.980
 And I think that, I don't know the ins and outs of it.

1:05:06.980 --> 1:05:09.300
 I've listened to people who are far more educated

1:05:09.300 --> 1:05:11.940
 on it than me and I'm unprepared to cite

1:05:11.940 --> 1:05:13.420
 any of their points.

1:05:14.500 --> 1:05:16.820
 I think you can see it a little bit in Dan Crenshaw.

1:05:16.820 --> 1:05:17.660
 Can I say this?

1:05:17.660 --> 1:05:19.620
 Yeah, I like him.

1:05:19.620 --> 1:05:21.500
 I really liked Dan,

1:05:21.500 --> 1:05:23.540
 especially like a year, year and a half ago.

1:05:23.540 --> 1:05:25.900
 He seemed very level headed.

1:05:25.900 --> 1:05:28.620
 It's clear to me now that as he panders

1:05:28.620 --> 1:05:30.140
 more and more to the right,

1:05:30.140 --> 1:05:33.980
 it's because he's setting himself for a presidential run.

1:05:33.980 --> 1:05:35.620
 It's clear that that's happening.

1:05:35.620 --> 1:05:38.060
 And he just doesn't seem like the same authentic

1:05:38.060 --> 1:05:42.380
 ideals oriented guy that he did a year and a half ago.

1:05:42.380 --> 1:05:43.540
 Now I could be wrong on that.

1:05:43.540 --> 1:05:44.580
 It could be way off.

1:05:44.580 --> 1:05:46.980
 But I think that you can take someone

1:05:46.980 --> 1:05:49.260
 as honest as you want to.

1:05:49.260 --> 1:05:52.540
 When you start them on that path to the presidency,

1:05:52.540 --> 1:05:56.180
 you become so unbelievably beholden

1:05:56.180 --> 1:05:58.820
 to so many people and entities along the way

1:05:59.860 --> 1:06:02.460
 that by the time you get to the final destination,

1:06:02.460 --> 1:06:05.500
 the Oval Office, all you're doing is paying back

1:06:05.500 --> 1:06:06.940
 the favors that got you there.

1:06:06.940 --> 1:06:08.460
 And you never get to serve the people

1:06:08.460 --> 1:06:09.820
 you're supposed to serve.

1:06:09.820 --> 1:06:12.460
 Your primary focus is on your office

1:06:12.460 --> 1:06:15.140
 and not on the people that you're supposed to be helping.

1:06:15.140 --> 1:06:17.020
 And I think that that's a humongous problem.

1:06:17.020 --> 1:06:19.780
 And like we could talk all about campaign finance reform

1:06:19.780 --> 1:06:20.980
 and the two party system.

1:06:20.980 --> 1:06:22.580
 But at the end of the day,

1:06:22.580 --> 1:06:26.420
 the people who are running for political posts,

1:06:27.300 --> 1:06:29.060
 they're working to keep a job.

1:06:29.060 --> 1:06:30.700
 They're not working to improve the lives

1:06:30.700 --> 1:06:33.340
 of the constituents, which is different.

1:06:33.340 --> 1:06:36.060
 A long, long time ago, like a lot of politicians,

1:06:36.060 --> 1:06:38.340
 those were like part time jobs.

1:06:38.340 --> 1:06:40.780
 And they held other posts out West.

1:06:40.780 --> 1:06:43.420
 They were ranchers by day and sheriff by night,

1:06:43.420 --> 1:06:44.780
 whatever the case might be.

1:06:44.780 --> 1:06:48.460
 But now, such a cushy path for the rest of your life

1:06:48.460 --> 1:06:51.060
 that the goal is to just be a politician,

1:06:51.060 --> 1:06:53.060
 not do the things that you think a politician

1:06:53.060 --> 1:06:54.620
 is supposed to do.

1:06:54.620 --> 1:06:55.460
 And that's a problem.

1:06:55.460 --> 1:06:58.660
 By the way, I'll talk to Dan on this.

1:06:58.660 --> 1:07:02.340
 It's funny, I like the version of him from a year ago

1:07:02.340 --> 1:07:03.740
 and I haven't been really paying attention.

1:07:03.740 --> 1:07:07.140
 So I'll be, I'll actually pay more attention now

1:07:07.140 --> 1:07:08.780
 and ask him that exact question.

1:07:08.780 --> 1:07:11.500
 Like, how do you prevent yourself from changing,

1:07:11.500 --> 1:07:14.140
 becoming what the Clintons became?

1:07:14.140 --> 1:07:16.460
 I tend to believe like there's conspiratorial stuff

1:07:16.460 --> 1:07:17.860
 about Clintons and all these politicians.

1:07:17.860 --> 1:07:19.820
 I tend to believe that they were actually

1:07:19.820 --> 1:07:21.660
 good, thoughtful people back in the day.

1:07:21.660 --> 1:07:23.780
 And the system changes them.

1:07:25.060 --> 1:07:26.340
 It's not even the system.

1:07:27.340 --> 1:07:30.620
 There's something about just the process of campaigning.

1:07:30.620 --> 1:07:33.380
 I just think it wears you down to where

1:07:33.380 --> 1:07:35.920
 if you look at the percentage of time you spend

1:07:35.920 --> 1:07:38.380
 on the kinds of conversations you have,

1:07:38.380 --> 1:07:41.720
 it's like one, you do these speeches,

1:07:41.720 --> 1:07:43.980
 which you repeat the same thing over and over and over.

1:07:43.980 --> 1:07:47.620
 It beats the process of thinking.

1:07:47.620 --> 1:07:49.340
 You just exhaust your brain to where

1:07:49.340 --> 1:07:51.260
 you're not thinking anymore, you're just repeating.

1:07:51.260 --> 1:07:54.020
 It's very, it's exceptionally difficult

1:07:54.020 --> 1:07:57.580
 to keep making speech after speech after speech,

1:07:57.580 --> 1:07:59.920
 saying the same thing over and over and over again,

1:07:59.920 --> 1:08:01.900
 and at the same time thinking deeply

1:08:01.900 --> 1:08:04.020
 and changing your mind and learning.

1:08:04.020 --> 1:08:07.780
 And then also the pandering to financial,

1:08:07.780 --> 1:08:10.180
 like having phone calls, like fundraising,

1:08:10.180 --> 1:08:11.460
 all those kinds of things.

1:08:11.460 --> 1:08:12.300
 That's what they do now.

1:08:12.300 --> 1:08:13.820
 They spend most of their time fundraising.

1:08:13.820 --> 1:08:15.620
 They're not worried about anything.

1:08:15.620 --> 1:08:16.960
 Sorry to interrupt you, but I was gonna say

1:08:16.960 --> 1:08:19.500
 that you can see there's a fuel.

1:08:19.500 --> 1:08:24.500
 Like the more attention and the higher regard

1:08:24.700 --> 1:08:26.260
 you're held in in your community,

1:08:26.260 --> 1:08:28.860
 and the more sycophants like continue

1:08:28.860 --> 1:08:30.460
 to blow smoke up your ass,

1:08:30.460 --> 1:08:32.860
 the more it changes the way you present yourself.

1:08:32.860 --> 1:08:35.100
 And you can see it in every walk of life.

1:08:35.100 --> 1:08:37.620
 I mean, jiu jitsu is a tiny, tiny little section

1:08:37.620 --> 1:08:40.200
 of the world, but you see it in the jiu jitsu community.

1:08:40.200 --> 1:08:42.500
 When someone all of a sudden starts a social media page

1:08:42.500 --> 1:08:44.500
 or whatever, and they get a bunch of people,

1:08:44.500 --> 1:08:48.140
 like basically like cyber fellating them

1:08:48.140 --> 1:08:51.220
 on their Instagram page, they change.

1:08:51.220 --> 1:08:52.660
 Fellating, is that a word?

1:08:52.660 --> 1:08:53.500
 I think so.

1:08:53.500 --> 1:08:54.860
 So giving fellatio?

1:08:54.860 --> 1:08:55.700
 Yeah.

1:08:55.700 --> 1:08:56.600
 So fellating.

1:08:56.600 --> 1:08:57.440
 Yeah.

1:08:57.440 --> 1:08:58.340
 Jamie, look it up.

1:08:59.740 --> 1:09:03.500
 I think, but in those people, it changes their character.

1:09:03.500 --> 1:09:04.340
 Yeah.

1:09:04.340 --> 1:09:06.860
 It changes who they are because they become emboldened

1:09:06.860 --> 1:09:09.980
 and now they've got this like mythical cyber mob

1:09:09.980 --> 1:09:11.340
 behind them.

1:09:11.340 --> 1:09:13.620
 There's a sign at the entrance to your gym

1:09:13.620 --> 1:09:16.660
 that reads, for every moment of triumph,

1:09:16.660 --> 1:09:19.260
 it's a quote by Hunter S. Thompson.

1:09:19.260 --> 1:09:21.300
 It reads, for every moment of triumph,

1:09:21.300 --> 1:09:25.460
 for every instance of beauty, many souls must be trampled.

1:09:27.020 --> 1:09:28.620
 What does this quote mean to you?

1:09:29.940 --> 1:09:33.240
 That quote to me is about, mostly about sacrifice.

1:09:34.980 --> 1:09:38.260
 And it's about to achieve anything great

1:09:38.260 --> 1:09:41.220
 or anything beautiful or to triumph,

1:09:41.220 --> 1:09:44.620
 you have to have sacrificed so many things to get there,

1:09:44.620 --> 1:09:48.340
 unless you're the most unbelievably genetically gifted person

1:09:48.340 --> 1:09:51.500
 in the world and greatness is just, you know,

1:09:51.500 --> 1:09:53.920
 falls upon you, it's just raining from the sky.

1:09:53.920 --> 1:09:58.260
 I think on your path to greatness,

1:09:58.260 --> 1:10:00.360
 on your path to success and triumph,

1:10:00.360 --> 1:10:02.460
 you leave a lot of carnage in your wake,

1:10:02.460 --> 1:10:04.840
 personal relationships, other goals,

1:10:04.840 --> 1:10:08.540
 things that you didn't pursue, you know,

1:10:08.540 --> 1:10:10.060
 other unfulfilled dreams.

1:10:10.060 --> 1:10:12.260
 And you kind of have to sell a lot of that out

1:10:12.260 --> 1:10:17.260
 in order to be really at the peak of your field

1:10:18.180 --> 1:10:20.200
 or what you want to be.

1:10:22.060 --> 1:10:23.440
 I know that that's happened in my life.

1:10:23.440 --> 1:10:26.820
 I mean, there's tons and tons of relationships

1:10:26.820 --> 1:10:31.100
 that, you know, couldn't survive the way

1:10:31.100 --> 1:10:31.980
 that I was living my life,

1:10:31.980 --> 1:10:34.420
 because when I was trying to be a big time fighter

1:10:34.420 --> 1:10:36.900
 or like when I was just training all the time,

1:10:36.900 --> 1:10:41.020
 tons of relationships dissolve themselves naturally,

1:10:41.020 --> 1:10:43.100
 some not so naturally.

1:10:43.100 --> 1:10:44.740
 Some people get it, some people don't get it,

1:10:44.740 --> 1:10:49.260
 some people hate you, you miss tons of other opportunities.

1:10:49.260 --> 1:10:51.600
 And I think that's kind of what that quote means to me.

1:10:51.600 --> 1:10:52.740
 It's about sacrifice.

1:10:52.740 --> 1:10:57.180
 It's about you're giving up what you want now

1:10:57.180 --> 1:10:58.460
 for what you want more.

1:11:01.100 --> 1:11:05.780
 And it's the trampling of souls, it's messy too,

1:11:05.780 --> 1:11:09.880
 because it's not clear what the right path is.

1:11:10.840 --> 1:11:13.500
 Like that sacrifice is not obvious

1:11:13.500 --> 1:11:16.660
 that those are the right sacrifices to make.

1:11:16.660 --> 1:11:19.820
 You might be ruining your own life,

1:11:19.820 --> 1:11:22.980
 but the fact that you're willing to take that risk

1:11:22.980 --> 1:11:27.980
 and sort of go all in on whether it's stupid or not,

1:11:29.700 --> 1:11:31.280
 go all in on something,

1:11:32.220 --> 1:11:35.700
 that the possibility of creating something beautiful

1:11:35.700 --> 1:11:36.540
 is there.

1:11:36.540 --> 1:11:37.660
 Who says it's stupid?

1:11:37.660 --> 1:11:40.060
 If you're going all in on it, you don't think it's stupid.

1:11:40.060 --> 1:11:41.780
 Someone else might think it's stupid,

1:11:41.780 --> 1:11:44.020
 but I mean, who really cares?

1:11:44.020 --> 1:11:46.460
 Well, I'm of many minds on many things,

1:11:46.460 --> 1:11:49.380
 so I feel like there's certain minds,

1:11:49.380 --> 1:11:52.220
 certain moves of the day where you think it's stupid.

1:11:52.220 --> 1:11:54.020
 Like relationships is a beautiful one,

1:11:54.020 --> 1:11:56.980
 which is, you've seen the movie Whiplash, by any chance?

1:11:56.980 --> 1:11:57.820
 Yes.

1:11:59.220 --> 1:12:02.820
 It seems like in a man's life,

1:12:02.820 --> 1:12:06.620
 or it could be a woman's, but I don't identify as a woman,

1:12:06.620 --> 1:12:08.900
 so I know the man, the lived experience.

1:12:08.900 --> 1:12:10.380
 It's 2020, bro.

1:12:10.380 --> 1:12:13.780
 But my lived experience for now is that of a man.

1:12:13.780 --> 1:12:15.220
 We'll see about tomorrow.

1:12:15.220 --> 1:12:19.940
 And there is, in the pursuit of excellence,

1:12:19.940 --> 1:12:22.620
 there's often a choice of,

1:12:24.540 --> 1:12:26.420
 some of the souls that must be trampled

1:12:26.420 --> 1:12:29.640
 are personal relationships with humans in your life

1:12:29.640 --> 1:12:30.940
 that you might deeply care about.

1:12:30.940 --> 1:12:33.420
 It could be family, it could be friends,

1:12:33.420 --> 1:12:36.780
 it could be loved ones of all different forms.

1:12:36.780 --> 1:12:40.140
 It could be the people that, your colleagues

1:12:40.140 --> 1:12:42.840
 that are dependent on you, people who will lose jobs

1:12:42.840 --> 1:12:45.820
 because of the decisions you make, all this kind of stuff.

1:12:45.820 --> 1:12:48.660
 It seems that that moment happens,

1:12:48.660 --> 1:12:52.100
 and I'm not sure that sacrifice is always the correct one.

1:12:52.100 --> 1:12:53.960
 Like, to me, the movie Whiplash,

1:12:53.960 --> 1:12:56.780
 for people who haven't seen, spoiler alert, maybe?

1:12:56.780 --> 1:13:00.260
 I don't even know if that movie has any spoilers,

1:13:00.260 --> 1:13:02.860
 but there is a relationship with a female.

1:13:02.860 --> 1:13:04.860
 There's a student, there's a drummer

1:13:04.860 --> 1:13:06.380
 that's pursuing excellence

1:13:06.380 --> 1:13:09.380
 of this particular art form of drumming,

1:13:09.380 --> 1:13:14.380
 and he has a brief, fleeting relationship with a female,

1:13:14.780 --> 1:13:16.400
 and he also has an instructor

1:13:16.400 --> 1:13:18.380
 that's pushing him to his limits

1:13:18.380 --> 1:13:20.460
 in what appears to be awfully a lot

1:13:20.460 --> 1:13:22.820
 like a toxic relationship.

1:13:22.820 --> 1:13:26.780
 And he chooses, not chooses,

1:13:26.780 --> 1:13:31.180
 he naturally makes the decision

1:13:31.180 --> 1:13:34.780
 to sacrifice the romantic relationship with the woman

1:13:34.780 --> 1:13:39.380
 in further pursuit of this chaos of,

1:13:39.380 --> 1:13:41.420
 this chaotic pursuit of excellence.

1:13:41.420 --> 1:13:45.520
 And that doesn't feel like a deliberate decision.

1:13:45.520 --> 1:13:49.120
 It feels like a giant mess of like an emotional mess

1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:50.360
 where you're just like,

1:13:51.460 --> 1:13:55.420
 kind of like a fish swimming against stream,

1:13:55.420 --> 1:13:57.560
 just like, fuck it.

1:13:57.560 --> 1:14:00.760
 You let go of all the things that convention says

1:14:00.760 --> 1:14:02.300
 you should appreciate.

1:14:02.300 --> 1:14:04.780
 You throw away the possibility of a stable life,

1:14:04.780 --> 1:14:05.840
 of a comfortable life,

1:14:05.840 --> 1:14:10.140
 of what society says is a meaningful life,

1:14:10.140 --> 1:14:12.180
 and just pursue this crazy thing

1:14:12.180 --> 1:14:14.980
 full of seeming toxicity

1:14:14.980 --> 1:14:16.920
 with crazy people surrounding you.

1:14:16.920 --> 1:14:17.760
 I don't know.

1:14:17.760 --> 1:14:19.460
 So I don't know what the right decision is.

1:14:19.460 --> 1:14:22.620
 Part of my brain says, you should stay with the girl.

1:14:22.620 --> 1:14:26.060
 Fuck that instructor that's making you,

1:14:26.060 --> 1:14:29.180
 that's pushing you to places where it's like,

1:14:29.180 --> 1:14:31.240
 that are destructive, potentially destructive,

1:14:31.240 --> 1:14:32.780
 like could lead to suicide,

1:14:32.780 --> 1:14:36.060
 could lead you to completely

1:14:39.820 --> 1:14:43.920
 fail or fail on your pursuit of excellence

1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:47.100
 or destroy the dream,

1:14:47.100 --> 1:14:48.740
 the passionate pursuit of the thing

1:14:48.740 --> 1:14:50.060
 that you've always dreamed for,

1:14:50.060 --> 1:14:51.440
 in that case is drumming.

1:14:51.440 --> 1:14:52.280
 I don't know.

1:14:52.280 --> 1:14:53.220
 There's so many minds there.

1:14:53.220 --> 1:14:54.500
 Like what is the right thing to do?

1:14:54.500 --> 1:14:55.700
 So my first two thoughts are,

1:14:55.700 --> 1:14:58.300
 number one, fuck convention.

1:14:58.300 --> 1:14:59.260
 What is convention?

1:14:59.260 --> 1:15:01.660
 It's like some laid out path,

1:15:01.660 --> 1:15:03.620
 some linear progression of the way your life

1:15:03.620 --> 1:15:04.820
 is supposed to go,

1:15:04.820 --> 1:15:07.620
 like that someone can draw a picture of at the end.

1:15:07.620 --> 1:15:11.940
 That shit's, first of all, it's just boring and whatever.

1:15:11.940 --> 1:15:14.720
 And it's, I don't wanna say that it's cowardly

1:15:14.720 --> 1:15:16.100
 because it isn't cowardly,

1:15:16.100 --> 1:15:18.500
 but for someone who's not conventional

1:15:18.500 --> 1:15:21.060
 to not be nonconventional is cowardly,

1:15:21.060 --> 1:15:22.660
 to get sucked into the convention.

1:15:22.660 --> 1:15:23.540
 That's first.

1:15:23.540 --> 1:15:24.900
 Second of all,

1:15:24.900 --> 1:15:28.420
 I believe that scene in the diner in that movie

1:15:28.420 --> 1:15:30.700
 where he tells her you're in my way

1:15:30.700 --> 1:15:33.680
 because I'm gonna want to be with you,

1:15:33.680 --> 1:15:35.940
 or you're going to want me to be going out to dinner

1:15:35.940 --> 1:15:37.640
 with you and I know I should be practicing,

1:15:37.640 --> 1:15:39.100
 or I know I should be training.

1:15:39.100 --> 1:15:40.640
 And ultimately I'm gonna make,

1:15:40.640 --> 1:15:43.340
 I'm either gonna feel bad about not being with you

1:15:43.340 --> 1:15:44.180
 by training,

1:15:44.180 --> 1:15:46.040
 or I'm gonna skip the training to be with you

1:15:46.040 --> 1:15:47.660
 and neither one is right.

1:15:47.660 --> 1:15:49.500
 The whole thing that they don't mention in that

1:15:49.500 --> 1:15:51.060
 is that that's the wrong girl.

1:15:51.980 --> 1:15:53.140
 That's the wrong girl.

1:15:53.140 --> 1:15:55.840
 The right girl is a gangster.

1:15:55.840 --> 1:15:59.860
 The right girl says, oh, you've practiced tonight?

1:15:59.860 --> 1:16:01.820
 I'll leave you a sandwich and some milk

1:16:01.820 --> 1:16:04.740
 so that you can, outside the door,

1:16:04.740 --> 1:16:05.760
 let me know when you're done,

1:16:05.760 --> 1:16:07.740
 or you have some free time.

1:16:07.740 --> 1:16:09.400
 The right girl compliments that.

1:16:09.400 --> 1:16:11.780
 She's not an impediment in any way.

1:16:11.780 --> 1:16:16.340
 Even if what you wanna do is be with her so much

1:16:16.340 --> 1:16:17.620
 that you're putting the drums down,

1:16:17.620 --> 1:16:18.700
 or you're putting the bass down,

1:16:18.700 --> 1:16:19.860
 or you're picking up the pizza,

1:16:19.860 --> 1:16:22.340
 or you're not going to training,

1:16:22.340 --> 1:16:24.660
 that girl, without even telling you

1:16:24.660 --> 1:16:26.280
 why she's making decisions,

1:16:26.280 --> 1:16:29.400
 is making decisions to help you achieve your goal.

1:16:29.400 --> 1:16:32.880
 Now that might sound like some sort of chauvinistic

1:16:32.880 --> 1:16:34.360
 king of the castle type shit

1:16:34.360 --> 1:16:36.180
 where everyone should cater to you,

1:16:36.180 --> 1:16:37.860
 but the fact of the matter is

1:16:40.700 --> 1:16:42.940
 that person is a compliment to your life

1:16:42.940 --> 1:16:44.740
 in helping you do your thing,

1:16:44.740 --> 1:16:46.620
 and in your own way you're helping them

1:16:46.620 --> 1:16:48.860
 to achieve whatever their goals are also.

1:16:48.860 --> 1:16:51.860
 It's uncommon that you have two people under the same roof

1:16:51.860 --> 1:16:56.620
 striving to be unbelievably excellent in one small area.

1:16:56.620 --> 1:16:59.460
 It's not impossible, but it's uncommon.

1:16:59.460 --> 1:17:01.900
 Relationships have to be like binary systems,

1:17:01.900 --> 1:17:03.260
 like two stars.

1:17:03.260 --> 1:17:05.800
 The gravitational pull is what keeps you together

1:17:05.800 --> 1:17:08.060
 and circling around one another, right?

1:17:08.060 --> 1:17:11.180
 And one is bigger than the other,

1:17:11.180 --> 1:17:12.420
 and they'll fluctuate,

1:17:12.420 --> 1:17:14.380
 and the stars will get bigger,

1:17:14.380 --> 1:17:15.220
 and they'll get smaller,

1:17:15.220 --> 1:17:19.780
 and they'll contract based on positioning and composition.

1:17:19.780 --> 1:17:21.700
 That's the way a relationship should be,

1:17:21.700 --> 1:17:24.420
 not an asteroid coming in to disrupt

1:17:25.620 --> 1:17:27.100
 the surface of your planet.

1:17:27.100 --> 1:17:28.820
 It's a binary system, it's a compliment.

1:17:28.820 --> 1:17:30.740
 That girl was the wrong girl for him.

1:17:30.740 --> 1:17:31.720
 So you shouldn't,

1:17:32.660 --> 1:17:35.220
 like the big unconventional dreams

1:17:36.220 --> 1:17:41.220
 should not be adjusted to fit into this world.

1:17:41.260 --> 1:17:42.860
 Because I mean, there is a part of me

1:17:42.860 --> 1:17:43.940
 that's like full of self thought,

1:17:43.940 --> 1:17:45.740
 well, maybe you're just a dick.

1:17:45.740 --> 1:17:46.580
 Maybe.

1:17:46.580 --> 1:17:48.020
 Yeah, who cares?

1:17:48.020 --> 1:17:49.900
 Lex, so first of all,

1:17:51.540 --> 1:17:52.820
 who cares?

1:17:52.820 --> 1:17:55.240
 This is, by the way, somebody who's,

1:17:56.580 --> 1:17:58.660
 you have recently gotten,

1:17:58.660 --> 1:18:01.540
 well, in the span of the history of the universe

1:18:01.540 --> 1:18:03.140
 is recently you've gotten to a relationship,

1:18:03.140 --> 1:18:04.740
 but you haven't always,

1:18:04.740 --> 1:18:08.980
 you have not felt the need to be in the relationship

1:18:08.980 --> 1:18:10.620
 just because you're supposed to

1:18:10.620 --> 1:18:13.780
 by society's kind of momentum.

1:18:13.780 --> 1:18:16.900
 If you, I think that if you really want anything,

1:18:16.900 --> 1:18:20.700
 you've got to be prepared fully to be the exact opposite.

1:18:20.700 --> 1:18:22.860
 If you're a person who's looking for a relationship,

1:18:22.860 --> 1:18:24.700
 the only way you're going to get in an awesome relationship

1:18:24.700 --> 1:18:26.740
 is by being comfortable being alone,

1:18:26.740 --> 1:18:27.940
 because that's the risk.

1:18:27.940 --> 1:18:29.380
 If you're a person who's driven by money,

1:18:29.380 --> 1:18:31.460
 you've got to be comfortable being totally poor

1:18:31.460 --> 1:18:33.540
 because that's the risk, right?

1:18:33.540 --> 1:18:37.180
 And when you're constantly hedging your bets,

1:18:37.180 --> 1:18:38.740
 you're never all in.

1:18:38.740 --> 1:18:41.340
 You're never all in on the thing you're trying to do.

1:18:41.340 --> 1:18:45.500
 So a relationship has to compliment your life.

1:18:45.500 --> 1:18:50.460
 You can't say, it's okay to want to be in a relationship,

1:18:50.460 --> 1:18:53.660
 but you can't want to be in a relationship so bad

1:18:53.660 --> 1:18:56.300
 that you take someone in who fits the suit.

1:18:56.300 --> 1:18:58.540
 And it's like, oh, our schedules kind of work out.

1:18:58.540 --> 1:19:00.620
 You live near me and this and that and the other thing,

1:19:00.620 --> 1:19:02.660
 because the logistics of a relationship

1:19:02.660 --> 1:19:04.140
 are not always perfect.

1:19:04.140 --> 1:19:07.020
 It's what matters is when the two people are together.

1:19:07.020 --> 1:19:08.660
 That's the perfect part of it.

1:19:08.660 --> 1:19:13.660
 And it's great to want to meet people and say,

1:19:14.260 --> 1:19:18.900
 if we meet and some sort of a relationship develops,

1:19:18.900 --> 1:19:20.500
 I'm willing to run with it,

1:19:20.500 --> 1:19:23.580
 but I'm not meeting you hoping a relationship develops.

1:19:23.580 --> 1:19:25.460
 I think you kind of put the cart before the horse

1:19:25.460 --> 1:19:27.220
 in a lot of those situations.

1:19:27.220 --> 1:19:28.900
 It's like when guys meet.

1:19:28.900 --> 1:19:32.420
 No guy goes out and is like, I'm looking for a bro, right?

1:19:32.420 --> 1:19:33.260
 Nobody does that.

1:19:33.260 --> 1:19:35.100
 You go to the gym and you run into a bunch of dudes

1:19:35.100 --> 1:19:36.540
 and the next thing you know, someone's cool

1:19:36.540 --> 1:19:37.900
 and they want to talk about fighting

1:19:37.900 --> 1:19:39.380
 and you're fucking shotgun and beers.

1:19:39.380 --> 1:19:41.740
 And all of a sudden you got a bro and that's how it works.

1:19:41.740 --> 1:19:43.140
 It works the same way with women.

1:19:43.140 --> 1:19:45.140
 What's a shotgun and beers?

1:19:45.140 --> 1:19:45.980
 I'll show you after this.

1:19:45.980 --> 1:19:49.260
 You poke a hole in the bottom and you open the top.

1:19:49.260 --> 1:19:52.660
 Yeah, this is the problem with America.

1:19:52.660 --> 1:19:54.980
 Drink vodka like a man.

1:19:54.980 --> 1:19:57.220
 Okay, now don't poke holes in beers.

1:19:57.220 --> 1:19:59.380
 This is the problem with the frat culture.

1:19:59.380 --> 1:20:00.580
 They don't really know how to drink.

1:20:00.580 --> 1:20:01.620
 They think they know how to drink.

1:20:01.620 --> 1:20:02.940
 They don't know how to drink.

1:20:02.940 --> 1:20:07.900
 What do you think makes a successful relationship

1:20:07.900 --> 1:20:09.740
 if we can linger on that a little longer?

1:20:09.740 --> 1:20:14.740
 Like, let me ask John Clark about love.

1:20:17.540 --> 1:20:20.140
 I didn't ask a question, but let me just say love.

1:20:22.220 --> 1:20:23.460
 About love.

1:20:26.660 --> 1:20:31.660
 Are you one of those people who never says I love you?

1:20:31.660 --> 1:20:34.580
 No, no, I'm an extreme person.

1:20:34.580 --> 1:20:37.700
 And like my emotions are also extreme.

1:20:37.700 --> 1:20:42.060
 And one of the things I concern myself with,

1:20:43.380 --> 1:20:45.980
 maybe this is philosophical and martial arts warrior

1:20:45.980 --> 1:20:50.300
 soldier type related stuff is like, I don't want anyone.

1:20:50.300 --> 1:20:52.380
 If I die tonight on the drive home,

1:20:52.380 --> 1:20:54.140
 hopefully that doesn't happen.

1:20:54.140 --> 1:20:56.300
 I hope that no one is left questioning

1:20:56.300 --> 1:20:57.460
 how I felt about them.

1:20:57.460 --> 1:21:02.460
 And people I don't like probably are not questioning that.

1:21:02.780 --> 1:21:04.860
 And so the thing that I've had to learn

1:21:04.860 --> 1:21:06.660
 how to do later in life is to tell the people

1:21:06.660 --> 1:21:10.100
 that you care about, that you care about them.

1:21:10.100 --> 1:21:14.820
 And each thing can be equally off putting

1:21:14.820 --> 1:21:16.460
 to the receiver of the message.

1:21:18.540 --> 1:21:20.060
 Each thing can be equally off putting

1:21:20.060 --> 1:21:20.900
 to the receiver of the message.

1:21:20.900 --> 1:21:22.700
 When you're letting someone know how much you dislike them,

1:21:22.700 --> 1:21:24.100
 that can be off putting to the person

1:21:24.100 --> 1:21:25.260
 receiving that message.

1:21:25.260 --> 1:21:27.100
 And when you tell someone how much you care about them,

1:21:27.100 --> 1:21:29.860
 it can also be off putting to the person,

1:21:29.860 --> 1:21:32.620
 depending on how they view their relationship with you.

1:21:32.620 --> 1:21:34.580
 But it's still important to get it out there.

1:21:34.580 --> 1:21:37.180
 Like you shouldn't hold those things in

1:21:37.180 --> 1:21:39.220
 because you're worried about how they'll be received

1:21:39.220 --> 1:21:41.540
 or if they'll come back at you.

1:21:41.540 --> 1:21:45.460
 So you're okay going all in on these?

1:21:45.460 --> 1:21:46.300
 Yeah.

1:21:46.300 --> 1:21:47.700
 Not afraid of commitment?

1:21:47.700 --> 1:21:48.860
 No, I'm not afraid of commitment.

1:21:48.860 --> 1:21:50.140
 Anyone who says they're afraid of commitment

1:21:50.140 --> 1:21:50.980
 is full of shit.

1:21:50.980 --> 1:21:51.820
 You know what they're afraid of?

1:21:51.820 --> 1:21:54.660
 They're afraid of commitment with that person.

1:21:54.660 --> 1:21:56.020
 That's what they're afraid of.

1:21:56.020 --> 1:22:00.220
 Like when someone knocks you on your ass

1:22:00.220 --> 1:22:01.820
 and they come into your life

1:22:01.820 --> 1:22:04.540
 and you're flush with all these emotions,

1:22:04.540 --> 1:22:05.900
 you're not worried about,

1:22:05.900 --> 1:22:07.420
 oh, I don't really like commitment.

1:22:07.420 --> 1:22:08.900
 No, because they've knocked you on your ass.

1:22:08.900 --> 1:22:10.020
 You want to be with them.

1:22:10.020 --> 1:22:11.580
 You want those things.

1:22:11.580 --> 1:22:13.820
 The two most alive points in your life,

1:22:13.820 --> 1:22:16.700
 I think people feel is the euphoria of a new relationship

1:22:16.700 --> 1:22:19.900
 and then the loss when that love is gone.

1:22:21.300 --> 1:22:23.620
 You'll never feel more, I don't think,

1:22:23.620 --> 1:22:26.060
 than in those moments in your life.

1:22:26.060 --> 1:22:29.900
 See, the nice thing about the loss is it lasts longer.

1:22:31.340 --> 1:22:32.180
 Yeah.

1:22:33.780 --> 1:22:36.020
 That's a Louis C.K. point that he makes,

1:22:36.020 --> 1:22:39.700
 which is like that,

1:22:39.700 --> 1:22:41.740
 like in his show, I think,

1:22:41.740 --> 1:22:44.460
 is a conversation with an older gentleman

1:22:44.460 --> 1:22:45.980
 that says like that's his favorite part

1:22:45.980 --> 1:22:48.340
 of the relationship is that period

1:22:48.340 --> 1:22:51.900
 between the loss of the relationship

1:22:51.900 --> 1:22:56.220
 and the real death, which is forgetting the person.

1:22:56.220 --> 1:22:58.060
 But that period lasts the longest

1:22:58.060 --> 1:22:59.940
 and that's like the most fulfilling,

1:22:59.940 --> 1:23:02.900
 like missing the other person

1:23:02.900 --> 1:23:07.060
 is as fulfilling as the actual love,

1:23:07.060 --> 1:23:09.740
 the early infatuation, which is interesting.

1:23:09.740 --> 1:23:11.740
 I also think of the Bukowski.

1:23:11.740 --> 1:23:13.580
 I return to that.

1:23:13.580 --> 1:23:16.620
 There's a little clip of him in an interview

1:23:16.620 --> 1:23:21.220
 saying that love is a fog

1:23:21.220 --> 1:23:25.820
 that dissipates with the first light of reality

1:23:25.820 --> 1:23:26.660
 or something like that.

1:23:26.660 --> 1:23:28.220
 So basically emphasizing

1:23:28.220 --> 1:23:31.260
 that it's this very, very, very fleeting thing,

1:23:31.260 --> 1:23:36.260
 that it's a moments thing and then it just fades

1:23:36.460 --> 1:23:38.980
 and everything else is something else.

1:23:38.980 --> 1:23:41.780
 So love is only a temporary thing, which is interesting.

1:23:41.780 --> 1:23:44.820
 I think some people say that's cynical.

1:23:44.820 --> 1:23:45.660
 I don't know.

1:23:45.660 --> 1:23:46.500
 I don't know what to think of it.

1:23:46.500 --> 1:23:49.220
 I think it's important to understand

1:23:49.220 --> 1:23:51.340
 that everything is fleeting

1:23:51.340 --> 1:23:53.220
 when you don't put effort into it.

1:23:54.100 --> 1:23:55.740
 Almost everything will be fleeting.

1:23:55.740 --> 1:23:56.740
 If you don't put effort into it,

1:23:56.740 --> 1:23:58.060
 most people will get fat and lazy.

1:23:58.060 --> 1:23:59.340
 If you don't put effort into something,

1:23:59.340 --> 1:24:03.980
 you're gonna not be good at playing guitar or playing bass.

1:24:03.980 --> 1:24:04.940
 You've got to put effort into it.

1:24:04.940 --> 1:24:07.380
 The same thing goes for a relationship.

1:24:07.380 --> 1:24:12.100
 That the awesome part of it, that like love part,

1:24:12.100 --> 1:24:15.700
 that dies soon and early on in a relationship

1:24:15.700 --> 1:24:17.700
 because it's so good

1:24:17.700 --> 1:24:20.180
 that we think we don't have to work at it, but you do.

1:24:20.180 --> 1:24:21.780
 You have to keep doing the things

1:24:21.780 --> 1:24:24.500
 and you gotta keep things new and crisp and fresh.

1:24:24.500 --> 1:24:29.500
 And different people probably feel differently about this,

1:24:30.460 --> 1:24:33.700
 but I don't know, you walk around your girl

1:24:33.700 --> 1:24:35.220
 and you start like farting and stuff,

1:24:35.220 --> 1:24:37.260
 like that's when it all dies.

1:24:37.260 --> 1:24:39.100
 That's when it dies.

1:24:39.100 --> 1:24:40.340
 We're all human beings.

1:24:40.340 --> 1:24:44.340
 We're all here and our bodies work in the same way,

1:24:44.340 --> 1:24:48.140
 but you start to chip away at this beautiful thing

1:24:48.140 --> 1:24:53.140
 when you buck conventional courtesy and things like that.

1:24:56.660 --> 1:24:58.060
 Well, take it for granted, basically.

1:24:58.060 --> 1:24:59.140
 You take it for granted, yeah.

1:24:59.140 --> 1:25:00.980
 I mean, that's the same thing with life.

1:25:03.540 --> 1:25:06.260
 I'm a big fan of meditating on death

1:25:06.260 --> 1:25:08.060
 that you could die today.

1:25:08.060 --> 1:25:09.620
 In the same way you should meditate

1:25:09.620 --> 1:25:11.980
 on this relationship could end today,

1:25:11.980 --> 1:25:13.540
 this connection with another human could be.

1:25:13.540 --> 1:25:17.300
 This is the last time you could be interacting.

1:25:17.300 --> 1:25:19.140
 And your chances of that increase

1:25:19.140 --> 1:25:21.420
 when you take it for granted and you shit on people.

1:25:21.420 --> 1:25:24.500
 But when you work at it, the chances of that decrease.

1:25:24.500 --> 1:25:27.020
 It's never gonna be zero, but it decreases.

1:25:27.020 --> 1:25:30.100
 And when you do that, when you're the person

1:25:30.100 --> 1:25:32.140
 and you're trying to maintain

1:25:32.140 --> 1:25:35.020
 and you're trying to work at the relationship,

1:25:35.020 --> 1:25:37.580
 you gotta make sure that both people are working at it.

1:25:37.580 --> 1:25:39.700
 Otherwise, you're just a fucking chump.

1:25:39.700 --> 1:25:43.420
 Okay, let's return back to mixed martial arts.

1:25:43.420 --> 1:25:44.940
 Let me ask the ridiculous question

1:25:44.940 --> 1:25:47.780
 of who do you think are the top three,

1:25:47.780 --> 1:25:50.540
 maybe top five greatest fighters of all time?

1:25:51.740 --> 1:25:56.740
 It's so hard to compare fighters across generations.

1:25:57.220 --> 1:26:00.100
 And maybe one way to say it is which metrics

1:26:00.100 --> 1:26:01.420
 would you put on the table

1:26:01.420 --> 1:26:03.420
 as to measure what a great fighter is?

1:26:05.860 --> 1:26:08.260
 There was a guy named Dioxapus.

1:26:08.260 --> 1:26:13.260
 And in the fourth century, and he was such a badass

1:26:16.260 --> 1:26:18.820
 that in the Olympics in 336 BC,

1:26:18.820 --> 1:26:22.060
 no one even showed up to fight him in the Pancration event.

1:26:22.060 --> 1:26:24.620
 Nobody even showed up because he was fucking everybody up.

1:26:24.620 --> 1:26:26.460
 Years later, he was retired.

1:26:26.460 --> 1:26:29.460
 And this crazy Macedonian dude came there

1:26:29.460 --> 1:26:32.220
 at some dinner for Alexander the Great,

1:26:32.220 --> 1:26:33.820
 everyone's chilling, drinking,

1:26:33.820 --> 1:26:36.500
 whatever they were drinking out of their chalices.

1:26:36.500 --> 1:26:40.740
 And this Macedonian dude threatened him and challenged him.

1:26:40.740 --> 1:26:43.740
 So Dioxapus said, yeah, man, we'll throw down.

1:26:43.740 --> 1:26:45.780
 And they set the time and the place.

1:26:45.780 --> 1:26:49.460
 Macedonian dude comes out like body armor,

1:26:49.460 --> 1:26:52.420
 spear, shield, all this other shit.

1:26:52.420 --> 1:26:56.420
 Dioxapus came out absolutely naked with a wooden club

1:26:56.420 --> 1:26:58.500
 and took on this much younger guy,

1:26:58.500 --> 1:26:59.740
 beat the living crap out of him

1:26:59.740 --> 1:27:01.540
 and then put his foot on his throat

1:27:01.540 --> 1:27:06.540
 and then didn't even kill him in the show of ultimate power

1:27:07.380 --> 1:27:08.380
 for the time.

1:27:08.380 --> 1:27:09.220
 So I think.

1:27:09.220 --> 1:27:11.300
 There's something about the guy being naked too

1:27:11.300 --> 1:27:13.020
 is just extra demeaning.

1:27:13.020 --> 1:27:14.740
 Extra demeaning, yeah.

1:27:14.740 --> 1:27:18.580
 Okay, can we rephrase the question then?

1:27:18.580 --> 1:27:21.020
 Because those are clearly going to be

1:27:21.020 --> 1:27:23.940
 some probably forgotten warriors in history.

1:27:23.940 --> 1:27:26.540
 Well, let's take it to like modern day mixed martial arts

1:27:26.540 --> 1:27:27.660
 in the UFC, perhaps.

1:27:27.660 --> 1:27:30.380
 Well, just mixed martial arts there.

1:27:30.380 --> 1:27:32.180
 Who do you think are the top fighters of all time?

1:27:32.180 --> 1:27:34.180
 What metrics would you consider

1:27:34.180 --> 1:27:38.260
 in trying to answer this perhaps unanswerable question?

1:27:38.260 --> 1:27:40.060
 I think one of the things you want to think about

1:27:40.060 --> 1:27:44.140
 is strength of opponent at the time you fought them.

1:27:44.140 --> 1:27:48.220
 So for example, fighting BJ Penn in his prime

1:27:48.220 --> 1:27:50.340
 and beating him is far different

1:27:50.340 --> 1:27:52.740
 than beating BJ Penn last year, right?

1:27:52.740 --> 1:27:54.780
 So to say you have a victory over BJ Penn

1:27:54.780 --> 1:27:59.020
 is not the same given the timeframe of when it happened.

1:27:59.020 --> 1:28:01.980
 Not to take anything away from anyone who's beaten BJ Penn.

1:28:02.980 --> 1:28:05.300
 Just use that as an example of someone whose career

1:28:05.300 --> 1:28:07.780
 went into a different direction.

1:28:07.780 --> 1:28:12.780
 I would say the guy who I think is probably the best

1:28:14.460 --> 1:28:17.300
 that people are the least familiar with

1:28:17.300 --> 1:28:19.660
 would be Marillo Bustamante.

1:28:19.660 --> 1:28:23.260
 And I think he was a guy who was one of the guys

1:28:23.260 --> 1:28:26.740
 with the first really good physical build for MMA,

1:28:26.740 --> 1:28:29.860
 which I think is narrow from the chest to the back

1:28:29.860 --> 1:28:32.260
 and long shoulder to shoulder

1:28:32.260 --> 1:28:34.900
 and kind of sinewy made out of steel cable.

1:28:34.900 --> 1:28:36.700
 That was a guy who could box,

1:28:36.700 --> 1:28:37.980
 that was a guy who could wrestle,

1:28:37.980 --> 1:28:39.900
 and that was a guy who had great jujitsu.

1:28:39.900 --> 1:28:41.700
 He wasn't a great kickboxer,

1:28:41.700 --> 1:28:43.140
 but at the time he didn't need it.

1:28:43.140 --> 1:28:46.700
 Fought everybody and gave everybody a run.

1:28:46.700 --> 1:28:50.020
 I think he's probably one of those guys

1:28:50.020 --> 1:28:52.740
 who's gotta be considered.

1:28:52.740 --> 1:28:55.140
 Yeah, there's a few killers that never,

1:28:55.140 --> 1:28:57.940
 because why is he not in the discussion?

1:28:57.940 --> 1:29:02.940
 Because I think greatness requires both the skill

1:29:03.860 --> 1:29:06.780
 and the opportunity to meet each other.

1:29:06.780 --> 1:29:08.020
 And when you talk about a fighter,

1:29:08.020 --> 1:29:10.620
 the other thing that really a good fighter needs

1:29:10.620 --> 1:29:12.020
 to become great is a foil.

1:29:12.900 --> 1:29:15.540
 And so many fighters don't have a foil.

1:29:15.540 --> 1:29:17.460
 That's one of the biggest detractions, I think,

1:29:17.460 --> 1:29:19.220
 of early Mike Tyson's career.

1:29:19.220 --> 1:29:20.460
 He didn't have a foil.

1:29:20.460 --> 1:29:22.020
 He had no one driving him.

1:29:22.020 --> 1:29:23.100
 And by the time he did,

1:29:23.100 --> 1:29:25.140
 by the time he had a foil in Holyfield,

1:29:25.140 --> 1:29:26.740
 his career was in a different place.

1:29:26.740 --> 1:29:28.620
 But he's one of the greats of all time,

1:29:28.620 --> 1:29:30.100
 and he never really had a foil,

1:29:30.100 --> 1:29:35.100
 so his greatness was in unparalleled destruction

1:29:35.980 --> 1:29:40.980
 of like nobody as well, of lesser opponents.

1:29:42.220 --> 1:29:45.260
 Right, and so when people debate

1:29:46.500 --> 1:29:48.020
 the level of greatness of Mike Tyson,

1:29:48.020 --> 1:29:49.060
 that's one of the things they say,

1:29:49.060 --> 1:29:51.940
 like he didn't fight a lot of killers in their prime.

1:29:51.940 --> 1:29:55.940
 I think you've obviously got to say in that conversation,

1:29:55.940 --> 1:29:58.380
 I have a really difficult time

1:29:58.380 --> 1:30:01.020
 keeping George St. Pierre out of the conversation,

1:30:02.100 --> 1:30:06.380
 only because he was able to beat you with anything.

1:30:06.380 --> 1:30:09.740
 He could out jab you, he could out wrestle you,

1:30:09.740 --> 1:30:11.940
 and he could submit you.

1:30:11.940 --> 1:30:13.540
 The problem I have with Fedor

1:30:13.540 --> 1:30:18.540
 is his career also took a drastic turn towards the end.

1:30:18.540 --> 1:30:21.020
 And when he was fighting in Pride,

1:30:21.020 --> 1:30:22.660
 he was doing a lot more grappling,

1:30:22.660 --> 1:30:24.060
 and then he just started casting

1:30:24.060 --> 1:30:25.660
 that overhand right at people.

1:30:26.580 --> 1:30:29.540
 And his game kind of changed at that point.

1:30:29.540 --> 1:30:31.020
 You can't take anything away from his greatness,

1:30:31.020 --> 1:30:34.980
 but at that time, the great heavyweights

1:30:34.980 --> 1:30:37.540
 were not really fighting in Pride,

1:30:37.540 --> 1:30:38.700
 and they didn't really exist yet.

1:30:38.700 --> 1:30:40.140
 And by the time he fought a really good one,

1:30:40.140 --> 1:30:42.860
 Fabricio Verdun, he did get submitted there.

1:30:42.860 --> 1:30:47.860
 Does his later performance color your and our perception

1:30:47.860 --> 1:30:51.700
 of his greatness in general about fighters?

1:30:51.700 --> 1:30:55.220
 Not mine, but I'm someone who's intimately involved

1:30:55.220 --> 1:30:57.660
 in the sport, but it colors everyone else's.

1:30:57.660 --> 1:30:58.940
 Same with Anderson Silva.

1:30:58.940 --> 1:31:00.460
 I don't think Anderson Silva doesn't want to fight

1:31:00.460 --> 1:31:03.020
 in like seven years or something, or he's like one.

1:31:03.020 --> 1:31:06.900
 That's a guy who in his prime was one of the best fighters.

1:31:06.900 --> 1:31:08.500
 Is he in the top five for you?

1:31:08.500 --> 1:31:10.020
 I think he's probably in the top five, yeah.

1:31:10.020 --> 1:31:11.940
 Greater striker of all time or no?

1:31:11.940 --> 1:31:12.780
 In MMA?

1:31:12.780 --> 1:31:13.900
 In mixed martial arts.

1:31:13.900 --> 1:31:15.020
 In mixed martial arts?

1:31:15.020 --> 1:31:19.620
 In mixed martial arts, that's a tough question.

1:31:19.620 --> 1:31:22.300
 The greatest MMA striker of all time.

1:31:22.300 --> 1:31:23.860
 Because like the timing,

1:31:25.340 --> 1:31:27.620
 we're talking about foot sweeps, right?

1:31:27.620 --> 1:31:31.420
 Who makes it look easier than Anderson Silva?

1:31:31.420 --> 1:31:36.420
 I think in an incredibly short sample of his prime,

1:31:36.660 --> 1:31:37.940
 it's gotta be Anderson Silva,

1:31:37.940 --> 1:31:41.860
 and I think you have to consider discussing Leota Machida

1:31:41.860 --> 1:31:45.540
 for his unbelievable manipulation of distance,

1:31:45.540 --> 1:31:47.660
 which is something that people don't really talk too much

1:31:47.660 --> 1:31:48.940
 about in terms of fighting,

1:31:48.940 --> 1:31:50.940
 unless you're someone in the sport.

1:31:50.940 --> 1:31:54.340
 That his use of distance and the ability to like,

1:31:54.340 --> 1:31:57.820
 what we call pop out, like make you miss by one inch

1:31:57.820 --> 1:31:59.940
 so that he could follow your fist back in

1:31:59.940 --> 1:32:02.900
 as you retract it and it hit you over the top,

1:32:02.900 --> 1:32:06.180
 that that's a thing of beauty.

1:32:06.180 --> 1:32:08.540
 Anderson Silva, when he became a counter striker,

1:32:08.540 --> 1:32:10.220
 when he got to his prime in the UFC,

1:32:10.220 --> 1:32:11.820
 that was a thing of beauty.

1:32:11.820 --> 1:32:13.540
 That was a thing of beauty.

1:32:13.540 --> 1:32:15.060
 So I think definitely those two guys

1:32:15.060 --> 1:32:18.540
 and Murilo Bustamante's gotta be the third guy.

1:32:18.540 --> 1:32:20.140
 There's just so many good guys now.

1:32:20.140 --> 1:32:20.980
 It's just.

1:32:20.980 --> 1:32:23.100
 So where do you put, in terms of metrics,

1:32:23.100 --> 1:32:24.940
 you mentioned GSP and Anderson Silva,

1:32:24.940 --> 1:32:27.780
 I think they have a large number of defenses of a title.

1:32:28.780 --> 1:32:30.140
 Is that important to you?

1:32:30.140 --> 1:32:32.780
 Like this kind of consistent domination?

1:32:32.780 --> 1:32:36.180
 No, because it's easily manipulated

1:32:36.180 --> 1:32:38.340
 by the people making money off the fights.

1:32:38.340 --> 1:32:40.660
 So there was a great quote one time

1:32:40.660 --> 1:32:42.460
 when the UFC was coming to prominence

1:32:42.460 --> 1:32:46.620
 and Vince McMahon from the WWE, he said,

1:32:46.620 --> 1:32:48.260
 you know, the difference between what we do

1:32:48.260 --> 1:32:53.260
 and what UFC does is that when we have a superstar,

1:32:53.900 --> 1:32:55.460
 I can make sure he stays on top

1:32:55.460 --> 1:32:56.700
 until he's no longer a superstar

1:32:56.700 --> 1:32:58.900
 because we have predetermined results.

1:32:58.900 --> 1:33:01.500
 UFC can't do that because they're actually having fights.

1:33:01.500 --> 1:33:02.860
 Well, it's true and false.

1:33:02.860 --> 1:33:03.700
 You can't do that,

1:33:03.700 --> 1:33:07.580
 but you can give your superstars the most favorable matchups

1:33:07.580 --> 1:33:09.540
 to keep them on top for the longest.

1:33:09.540 --> 1:33:11.500
 So people always talk about title defenses

1:33:11.500 --> 1:33:13.980
 as if the guy they're fighting, the challenger,

1:33:13.980 --> 1:33:16.620
 is always the person most deserving of the shot.

1:33:16.620 --> 1:33:17.460
 And it's just not true.

1:33:17.460 --> 1:33:19.660
 So I don't put that much stock in it.

1:33:19.660 --> 1:33:23.700
 Is it possible to put a guy in consideration

1:33:23.700 --> 1:33:25.540
 as one of the greats

1:33:25.540 --> 1:33:29.460
 if all they had is one or two amazing fights?

1:33:30.940 --> 1:33:33.900
 I'll tell you, like an amazing

1:33:33.900 --> 1:33:35.740
 could be a lot of different definitions.

1:33:35.740 --> 1:33:37.340
 It could be just the war.

1:33:37.340 --> 1:33:39.060
 Like they never really reached

1:33:39.060 --> 1:33:41.460
 the highest of excellences of domination,

1:33:41.460 --> 1:33:44.140
 but they've, like this,

1:33:44.140 --> 1:33:47.180
 we had this discussion about Kyle Bokniak, right?

1:33:47.180 --> 1:33:48.020
 Yep.

1:33:49.140 --> 1:33:50.460
 To me, that's a perfect example.

1:33:50.460 --> 1:33:55.460
 He had this famous fight against Zabit Magomed Sharapov,

1:33:59.100 --> 1:34:03.620
 where on one side you have an Anderson Silva type of fighter

1:34:03.620 --> 1:34:07.460
 and Zabit, like just a very good striker.

1:34:07.460 --> 1:34:12.460
 Like, and then there's like the warrior on the Kyle side.

1:34:13.740 --> 1:34:14.660
 And just the fight,

1:34:14.660 --> 1:34:16.380
 they created something special together.

1:34:16.380 --> 1:34:17.620
 It was fight at night, whatever.

1:34:17.620 --> 1:34:22.620
 But the, you know, that fight was special on that night

1:34:23.060 --> 1:34:25.860
 because the two dance partners.

1:34:25.860 --> 1:34:27.700
 You can have a great performance

1:34:27.700 --> 1:34:28.900
 without being a great fighter.

1:34:28.900 --> 1:34:30.660
 Not saying neither of those guys is a great fighter,

1:34:30.660 --> 1:34:32.340
 but to answer your first question,

1:34:32.340 --> 1:34:36.220
 I think that having one or two great performances

1:34:36.220 --> 1:34:38.380
 does not necessarily mean that you are great.

1:34:38.380 --> 1:34:39.860
 I need a larger sample size.

1:34:39.860 --> 1:34:41.740
 I have no idea what that is.

1:34:41.740 --> 1:34:42.820
 I don't have any idea what that is.

1:34:42.820 --> 1:34:43.660
 And also,

1:34:48.540 --> 1:34:52.220
 where, how much weight does toughness have

1:34:52.220 --> 1:34:53.940
 when you're thinking about the criteria

1:34:53.940 --> 1:34:56.380
 when you define a great fighter?

1:34:56.380 --> 1:34:58.980
 That's a good question.

1:34:58.980 --> 1:35:00.740
 And I don't have the answer to it.

1:35:00.740 --> 1:35:03.220
 I admire the underdog that rises to the occasion

1:35:03.220 --> 1:35:04.420
 through brute force.

1:35:04.420 --> 1:35:05.260
 They didn't have,

1:35:05.260 --> 1:35:07.100
 they didn't bring the skillset to the table

1:35:07.100 --> 1:35:09.580
 that perhaps some of the greats have,

1:35:09.580 --> 1:35:12.260
 but they rose to the occasion.

1:35:12.260 --> 1:35:13.740
 I mean, there's something about that.

1:35:13.740 --> 1:35:14.580
 There's something about that.

1:35:14.580 --> 1:35:17.500
 And so now we're more talking about like

1:35:17.500 --> 1:35:18.900
 the internal attributes

1:35:18.900 --> 1:35:21.260
 as opposed to the external physical attributes.

1:35:21.260 --> 1:35:25.300
 And those are the things I think that you cannot teach.

1:35:25.300 --> 1:35:27.620
 Those things, you come in the door

1:35:27.620 --> 1:35:28.820
 and you either have that or you don't.

1:35:28.820 --> 1:35:30.940
 I think, and we talk about this all the time,

1:35:30.940 --> 1:35:31.900
 and this is one of the things

1:35:31.900 --> 1:35:34.180
 where my mind changes regularly.

1:35:34.180 --> 1:35:35.460
 Like on what makes a fighter,

1:35:35.460 --> 1:35:37.780
 is it born or is it bred?

1:35:37.780 --> 1:35:42.740
 And this week I'm of the opinion that it's in you.

1:35:42.740 --> 1:35:44.500
 And maybe it's in you and you suppress it

1:35:44.500 --> 1:35:46.140
 and people can tease it out of you,

1:35:46.140 --> 1:35:48.060
 but I don't think you can make someone

1:35:48.060 --> 1:35:49.980
 who doesn't have that seed in there.

1:35:49.980 --> 1:35:53.020
 I don't think you can turn them into that great warrior

1:35:53.020 --> 1:35:56.300
 with that level of grit and mental toughness.

1:35:56.300 --> 1:36:00.060
 Now, when that fight, when Kyle fights Zabit,

1:36:00.060 --> 1:36:02.180
 it's a unique situation for both guys.

1:36:02.180 --> 1:36:06.300
 It was kind of a later replacement fight for Kyle.

1:36:06.300 --> 1:36:08.220
 Zabit's star was on the rise.

1:36:08.220 --> 1:36:11.100
 And Kyle put the blueprint out there on how to beat Zabit.

1:36:12.420 --> 1:36:13.460
 Which is?

1:36:13.460 --> 1:36:14.740
 Which is pressure him

1:36:14.740 --> 1:36:16.140
 and try and drag him into the late rounds.

1:36:16.140 --> 1:36:19.540
 You notice that later on when Calvin Kader fought him,

1:36:19.540 --> 1:36:21.740
 they wouldn't give him five rounds.

1:36:21.740 --> 1:36:22.820
 They wanted five rounds.

1:36:22.820 --> 1:36:24.380
 And Zabit's camp, from what I understand,

1:36:24.380 --> 1:36:26.300
 would not agree to the five round fight.

1:36:26.300 --> 1:36:28.060
 Well, he didn't look.

1:36:28.060 --> 1:36:30.580
 Right, so with Kyle, it was a three round fight.

1:36:30.580 --> 1:36:31.420
 Three round fight.

1:36:31.420 --> 1:36:33.900
 And did it went to decision?

1:36:33.900 --> 1:36:34.740
 It went to decision.

1:36:34.740 --> 1:36:36.660
 Well, Zabit won the decision, clearly.

1:36:36.660 --> 1:36:39.380
 Did Kyle have a shot at winning the third round?

1:36:39.380 --> 1:36:40.660
 I don't remember the exact score,

1:36:40.660 --> 1:36:43.100
 but Kyle could have won the third round

1:36:43.100 --> 1:36:46.260
 had he done a couple things differently.

1:36:46.260 --> 1:36:48.500
 But I do believe in the fourth round,

1:36:48.500 --> 1:36:50.020
 I think Kyle wouldn't have won a fourth round.

1:36:50.020 --> 1:36:52.060
 And I think maybe even won the fight

1:36:52.060 --> 1:36:53.500
 if there would have been a fifth round.

1:36:53.500 --> 1:36:55.260
 And he was pressing forward,

1:36:56.980 --> 1:37:00.460
 perhaps in a funny way that you could tell me I'm wrong,

1:37:00.460 --> 1:37:04.100
 but it felt like he wasn't emphasizing head movement

1:37:04.100 --> 1:37:04.940
 at that point.

1:37:04.940 --> 1:37:05.900
 He went full Mike Tyson.

1:37:05.900 --> 1:37:07.620
 There was a point at which,

1:37:07.620 --> 1:37:09.180
 so it's funny that you say that.

1:37:09.180 --> 1:37:11.300
 Which is a contradiction, actually, because.

1:37:11.300 --> 1:37:12.940
 Mike Tyson had great head movement.

1:37:12.940 --> 1:37:15.100
 I actually don't know exactly what I mean

1:37:16.020 --> 1:37:17.780
 because he was in the pocket.

1:37:17.780 --> 1:37:19.140
 I think he was trying to do the movement.

1:37:19.140 --> 1:37:21.260
 He was just in the pocket and pressing forward.

1:37:21.260 --> 1:37:23.860
 And the fuck you attitude of just not pressing down.

1:37:23.860 --> 1:37:24.700
 That was a little bit later

1:37:24.700 --> 1:37:26.620
 when Zabit's back was towards the cage.

1:37:26.620 --> 1:37:28.460
 Towards the end of the round.

1:37:28.460 --> 1:37:30.540
 We get that fight.

1:37:30.540 --> 1:37:32.500
 And I said to Kyle, I was like,

1:37:32.500 --> 1:37:34.580
 look, this kid has been training martial arts

1:37:34.580 --> 1:37:36.180
 since he was three years old.

1:37:36.180 --> 1:37:39.100
 There's not an area where you're gonna out technique him.

1:37:39.100 --> 1:37:41.380
 And so we've gotta now channel some of that grit

1:37:41.380 --> 1:37:42.380
 that we know you have.

1:37:42.380 --> 1:37:44.460
 This is an opportunity to showcase it.

1:37:44.460 --> 1:37:46.340
 And I don't know how long I did it for,

1:37:47.300 --> 1:37:49.300
 because Kyle's much shorter than Zabit.

1:37:49.300 --> 1:37:50.780
 So for a good long while,

1:37:50.780 --> 1:37:51.980
 while we were training for Zabit,

1:37:51.980 --> 1:37:53.340
 I didn't even say anything.

1:37:53.340 --> 1:37:55.740
 And I just had clips of Mike Tyson training

1:37:55.740 --> 1:37:58.220
 on the TV in the gym and the head movement.

1:37:58.220 --> 1:37:59.500
 And I didn't even mention it.

1:37:59.500 --> 1:38:01.620
 And then we started to like get into it

1:38:01.620 --> 1:38:03.900
 and talk about getting inside the length

1:38:03.900 --> 1:38:06.540
 of the longer fighter and things like that.

1:38:06.540 --> 1:38:09.740
 And we kind of, which when some people train MMA,

1:38:09.740 --> 1:38:12.780
 they say, okay, this guy's a really good wrestler.

1:38:12.780 --> 1:38:15.460
 Let's think about avoiding the wrestling

1:38:15.460 --> 1:38:16.940
 or being a better wrestler.

1:38:16.940 --> 1:38:21.220
 And I think that when the difference in skill is so great,

1:38:21.220 --> 1:38:22.820
 those are both the wrong answer.

1:38:24.020 --> 1:38:26.220
 If a guy who's a really good wrestler wants to take you down

1:38:26.220 --> 1:38:27.540
 and you don't have a lot of wrestling experience,

1:38:27.540 --> 1:38:28.700
 he's probably gonna get you down

1:38:28.700 --> 1:38:30.580
 if he's got a good coach, right?

1:38:30.580 --> 1:38:32.620
 So you have to deal with that.

1:38:32.620 --> 1:38:35.500
 To then say, I'm gonna then learn in eight weeks

1:38:35.500 --> 1:38:37.220
 how to wrestle better than a guy who's been wrestling

1:38:37.220 --> 1:38:39.500
 since he was eight years old is also a bad idea.

1:38:39.500 --> 1:38:41.340
 So what we concentrated on for that camp

1:38:41.340 --> 1:38:43.380
 and it worked beautifully was

1:38:43.380 --> 1:38:45.900
 not getting caught in chain wrestling.

1:38:45.900 --> 1:38:48.060
 These are the takedowns you're gonna get caught with.

1:38:48.060 --> 1:38:50.460
 This is how to not get caught with the next step

1:38:50.460 --> 1:38:52.620
 while you're defending takedown one.

1:38:52.620 --> 1:38:54.140
 Cause it's the chain of techniques

1:38:54.140 --> 1:38:56.100
 that are gonna get fucked, right?

1:38:56.100 --> 1:38:58.820
 So we talked, we did a ton of work on get ups

1:38:58.820 --> 1:39:01.220
 and breaking the hands from the various takedowns.

1:39:01.220 --> 1:39:02.460
 Like it was a while ago now.

1:39:02.460 --> 1:39:05.260
 So I don't remember exactly the techniques we worked on,

1:39:05.260 --> 1:39:08.580
 but we concentrated on defend the first takedown

1:39:08.580 --> 1:39:10.220
 and stay out of the chain.

1:39:10.220 --> 1:39:12.700
 Don't get chained into a bunch of wrestling techniques

1:39:12.700 --> 1:39:14.980
 cause you will be out wrestled.

1:39:14.980 --> 1:39:16.060
 And that was really successful.

1:39:16.060 --> 1:39:18.740
 And then in the third round, Zabit was tired.

1:39:18.740 --> 1:39:19.900
 And...

1:39:19.900 --> 1:39:20.740
 He was tired.

1:39:20.740 --> 1:39:21.580
 He's Zabit got tired.

1:39:21.580 --> 1:39:23.500
 He cuts a tremendous amount of weight.

1:39:23.500 --> 1:39:26.300
 Like I can't see him staying at 145 forever

1:39:26.300 --> 1:39:28.100
 when they start giving him five round fights.

1:39:28.100 --> 1:39:29.460
 I don't even know if he's had a five round fight

1:39:29.460 --> 1:39:32.900
 and he may have, but I can't see him staying down there.

1:39:32.900 --> 1:39:35.060
 He's, the guy's like six one.

1:39:35.060 --> 1:39:36.900
 Guys, he's a giant of a guy.

1:39:36.900 --> 1:39:40.980
 So Kyle pressed forward there and he said,

1:39:40.980 --> 1:39:43.220
 he felt that there was no power left in Zabit's hands.

1:39:43.220 --> 1:39:44.820
 And so he felt fine.

1:39:44.820 --> 1:39:47.100
 And I think part of it was he fed off the crowd

1:39:47.100 --> 1:39:50.260
 as he moved forward and, you know,

1:39:50.260 --> 1:39:54.580
 saw that he wasn't taking a lot of damage.

1:39:54.580 --> 1:39:56.220
 Like the punches weren't staying him.

1:39:56.220 --> 1:39:58.580
 He started walking right through him.

1:39:58.580 --> 1:40:01.060
 It goes to your question of what makes a fighter.

1:40:01.060 --> 1:40:05.180
 Was the, him walking forward like that,

1:40:06.220 --> 1:40:07.860
 something that you're born with

1:40:07.860 --> 1:40:09.420
 or is that something you were training?

1:40:09.420 --> 1:40:11.300
 Is that the Mike Tyson on TV?

1:40:11.300 --> 1:40:12.620
 He's born with that.

1:40:12.620 --> 1:40:14.140
 Kyle is born with that.

1:40:14.140 --> 1:40:16.580
 And the crowd, I've been in a lot.

1:40:16.580 --> 1:40:17.420
 Was he in Boston?

1:40:17.420 --> 1:40:18.260
 No, he was in New York.

1:40:18.260 --> 1:40:19.100
 He was in Brooklyn.

1:40:19.100 --> 1:40:20.260
 I've been in a lot of arenas

1:40:20.260 --> 1:40:21.620
 for a lot of different sporting events.

1:40:21.620 --> 1:40:23.700
 That's one of the loudest things I've ever heard

1:40:23.700 --> 1:40:24.540
 when he did that.

1:40:24.540 --> 1:40:26.060
 I was going crazy.

1:40:26.060 --> 1:40:29.820
 And you ask about that being like taught or not.

1:40:29.820 --> 1:40:31.540
 Kyle is so much like that,

1:40:31.540 --> 1:40:33.740
 that I have to try and tease some of that out of him,

1:40:33.740 --> 1:40:34.980
 pull it back.

1:40:34.980 --> 1:40:39.740
 Because he's also so very technical when he wants to be

1:40:39.740 --> 1:40:42.220
 that the emotion and the fun of it

1:40:42.220 --> 1:40:43.980
 gets in the way of his technique.

1:40:43.980 --> 1:40:47.540
 And probably has cost him a couple of wins.

1:40:47.540 --> 1:40:48.380
 And so that's one of the things

1:40:48.380 --> 1:40:49.300
 we work on with him right now.

1:40:49.300 --> 1:40:52.300
 It's like staying within yourself, being a professional,

1:40:52.300 --> 1:40:54.940
 taking your time to download the information in round one

1:40:54.940 --> 1:40:56.780
 and then starting your fight in round two.

1:40:56.780 --> 1:40:58.420
 But the tension between those two things,

1:40:58.420 --> 1:41:02.740
 what makes, what on that day created one of the,

1:41:02.740 --> 1:41:06.700
 in my opinion, one of the greatest fights I've ever seen.

1:41:06.700 --> 1:41:07.860
 Joe Rogan agrees.

1:41:07.860 --> 1:41:09.140
 Yeah, it's one of the greatest fights

1:41:09.140 --> 1:41:10.580
 I've certainly ever seen.

1:41:10.580 --> 1:41:13.940
 So like, it's funny that you as a coach,

1:41:13.940 --> 1:41:16.860
 I can see the frustration of like,

1:41:16.860 --> 1:41:20.580
 like throwing away some of the strategy kind of thing.

1:41:20.580 --> 1:41:23.180
 Like you seeing like being not happy

1:41:23.180 --> 1:41:24.300
 that there could be things

1:41:24.300 --> 1:41:26.020
 that he could have done to win the fight.

1:41:26.020 --> 1:41:26.900
 It's in retrospect.

1:41:26.900 --> 1:41:28.500
 I think that at that time,

1:41:28.500 --> 1:41:30.740
 we were playing with incredible house money.

1:41:30.740 --> 1:41:33.180
 Like Kyle was a gigantic underdog in that fight.

1:41:33.180 --> 1:41:34.340
 Zabit was unstoppable.

1:41:34.340 --> 1:41:35.820
 I think people were probably picking him

1:41:35.820 --> 1:41:37.180
 to finish the fight in round one.

1:41:37.180 --> 1:41:38.020
 I think at that point,

1:41:38.020 --> 1:41:40.060
 no one had ever gone the distance with Zabit.

1:41:40.060 --> 1:41:42.100
 And no one certainly had, you know,

1:41:42.100 --> 1:41:43.620
 put that kind of performance together.

1:41:43.620 --> 1:41:47.260
 And I think Kyle put the blueprint out there.

1:41:47.260 --> 1:41:51.340
 And in retrospect, when I look at the last round,

1:41:51.340 --> 1:41:53.500
 yeah, there were things that could have been done differently,

1:41:53.500 --> 1:41:55.140
 but we're playing with house money at that point.

1:41:55.140 --> 1:41:57.340
 Like, I mean, let it fly.

1:41:57.340 --> 1:41:59.060
 You get to a point where you've got it,

1:41:59.060 --> 1:42:01.540
 you're down three rounds and there's 20 seconds left.

1:42:01.540 --> 1:42:03.420
 You got to move all your chips to the center of the table

1:42:03.420 --> 1:42:05.500
 and, you know, see what happens.

1:42:05.500 --> 1:42:07.460
 Do you remember what Joe Rogan said about it?

1:42:07.460 --> 1:42:09.620
 I remember like he got won over.

1:42:09.620 --> 1:42:11.900
 I think I have trouble remembering

1:42:11.900 --> 1:42:13.500
 because offline we talked about that fight

1:42:13.500 --> 1:42:15.420
 and he's exceptionally impressed by,

1:42:15.420 --> 1:42:18.740
 I mean, Joe's from Boston, so it's like,

1:42:18.740 --> 1:42:20.820
 I mean, there's a story there.

1:42:20.820 --> 1:42:23.100
 Okay, it sucks not,

1:42:23.100 --> 1:42:25.300
 you naturally want to romanticize,

1:42:25.300 --> 1:42:28.460
 like there's a Rocky versus like,

1:42:28.460 --> 1:42:30.380
 there's a Rocky IV, a Draga.

1:42:30.380 --> 1:42:34.460
 I mean, similar, I suppose, kind of chemistry.

1:42:35.820 --> 1:42:39.540
 Kyle's style represents the American.

1:42:39.540 --> 1:42:40.580
 Ideal, right?

1:42:40.580 --> 1:42:41.420
 The spirit.

1:42:41.420 --> 1:42:42.540
 Yeah, I mean, he's from Gloucester.

1:42:42.540 --> 1:42:45.740
 It's like, you could have dragged him off the docks

1:42:45.740 --> 1:42:47.540
 three hours before the fight and said,

1:42:47.540 --> 1:42:48.420
 hey, you want to go fight?

1:42:48.420 --> 1:42:50.300
 And he would have said yes.

1:42:50.300 --> 1:42:51.940
 Oh man, that was a special fight.

1:42:51.940 --> 1:42:53.780
 But that's, as per a discussion

1:42:53.780 --> 1:42:55.540
 of like greatest fighters of all time,

1:42:55.540 --> 1:42:59.580
 I tend to believe that that fight is more special

1:42:59.580 --> 1:43:04.460
 than the championship belt defenses by George St. Pierre.

1:43:04.460 --> 1:43:06.340
 Like, you know, there's something to that.

1:43:06.340 --> 1:43:11.340
 It's like Rocky, Rocky I is more special

1:43:12.220 --> 1:43:15.420
 than like Rocky III, right?

1:43:15.420 --> 1:43:19.820
 So like, it's the underdog or it's whatever,

1:43:19.820 --> 1:43:21.940
 like the dance partner is like going to war

1:43:21.940 --> 1:43:24.580
 and like that moment, I mean, it's bigger.

1:43:24.580 --> 1:43:26.980
 It's bigger than any individual fighter.

1:43:26.980 --> 1:43:29.740
 They create that and that,

1:43:29.740 --> 1:43:32.100
 I know it's not perhaps good for a career.

1:43:32.100 --> 1:43:34.300
 It's not good for like in terms of money,

1:43:34.300 --> 1:43:35.220
 in terms of longevity,

1:43:35.220 --> 1:43:36.340
 in terms of all those kinds of things,

1:43:36.340 --> 1:43:39.020
 but that's a special moment in the history of fighting

1:43:39.020 --> 1:43:40.140
 that you both created.

1:43:40.140 --> 1:43:42.560
 I can remember like right after,

1:43:42.560 --> 1:43:45.060
 like there was so much excitement in the air

1:43:45.060 --> 1:43:46.160
 during the third round.

1:43:46.160 --> 1:43:47.460
 And I remember being in the corner

1:43:47.460 --> 1:43:50.660
 and like, I was so excited at the end of it

1:43:50.660 --> 1:43:53.060
 that I had forgotten what happened in the other two rounds.

1:43:53.060 --> 1:43:53.900
 I didn't even know.

1:43:53.900 --> 1:43:56.620
 And I looked to Sean, one of the other corner men,

1:43:56.620 --> 1:43:58.860
 and I think I said to him, did we win?

1:43:58.860 --> 1:44:00.220
 When you rewatch the fight,

1:44:00.220 --> 1:44:01.380
 clearly we didn't win the fight.

1:44:01.380 --> 1:44:02.500
 I mean, we lost the other rounds,

1:44:02.500 --> 1:44:05.020
 but I got so caught up in that moment

1:44:05.020 --> 1:44:07.020
 and I just remember like,

1:44:07.020 --> 1:44:10.360
 I was so in awe of his performance

1:44:10.360 --> 1:44:12.360
 that like I forgot what was going on.

1:44:12.360 --> 1:44:16.060
 And it's so hard to not be a fan at that moment

1:44:16.060 --> 1:44:18.340
 and to stay within yourself and try and like coach,

1:44:18.340 --> 1:44:20.660
 but then what the fuck you even coaching at that point?

1:44:20.660 --> 1:44:21.820
 It's like, we're rumbling.

1:44:21.820 --> 1:44:22.660
 We got 30 seconds.

1:44:22.660 --> 1:44:23.480
 We're trying to win here.

1:44:23.480 --> 1:44:26.580
 And I remember like the performance itself,

1:44:26.580 --> 1:44:28.040
 I'm not a fan of moral victories,

1:44:28.040 --> 1:44:30.140
 but if ever there was gonna be one, that was one.

1:44:30.140 --> 1:44:32.140
 And when the fight was over and I grabbed Kyle,

1:44:32.140 --> 1:44:35.460
 like they hadn't even been to the center of the cage yet.

1:44:35.460 --> 1:44:38.460
 And I just hugged him and I said, you're my fucking hero.

1:44:38.460 --> 1:44:41.420
 And I remember being very emotional about that,

1:44:41.420 --> 1:44:43.260
 that I was able to be a part of that.

1:44:43.260 --> 1:44:45.460
 It feels wrong to say, but I was,

1:44:45.460 --> 1:44:46.860
 I kind of avoided saying it,

1:44:46.860 --> 1:44:49.740
 but I think if I'm being honest with my feelings,

1:44:49.740 --> 1:44:52.380
 this is a safe space for feelings.

1:44:52.380 --> 1:44:57.380
 Is I think it was the greatest mixed martial arts fight

1:44:57.620 --> 1:44:59.180
 I've ever seen.

1:44:59.180 --> 1:45:00.780
 And I don't think I'm being biased.

1:45:00.780 --> 1:45:02.860
 I was honestly thinking like, am I being biased?

1:45:02.860 --> 1:45:05.020
 I honestly don't think so.

1:45:05.020 --> 1:45:06.380
 I think that was the greatest fight.

1:45:06.380 --> 1:45:08.300
 Like if you wanna rank fights I've ever seen,

1:45:08.300 --> 1:45:10.780
 I think to me that was the greatest fight I've ever seen.

1:45:10.780 --> 1:45:13.820
 It certainly was one of the greatest displays

1:45:13.820 --> 1:45:17.900
 of like just dogged effort from an underdog

1:45:17.900 --> 1:45:22.500
 who was out experienced and probably outsized.

1:45:22.500 --> 1:45:25.140
 But I mean, like you just,

1:45:25.140 --> 1:45:26.180
 Kyle's one of those kids,

1:45:26.180 --> 1:45:27.980
 you're never gonna tell him he's out of a fight.

1:45:27.980 --> 1:45:29.900
 He has something you can't teach.

1:45:29.900 --> 1:45:34.900
 And I've seen tons of people with more physical attributes

1:45:35.260 --> 1:45:36.820
 and they're just mental midgets

1:45:36.820 --> 1:45:39.700
 and they got a million dollar body and a 50 cent heart.

1:45:39.700 --> 1:45:42.220
 And Kyle is not that.

1:45:42.220 --> 1:45:44.340
 And you can't teach it no matter what you do.

1:45:44.340 --> 1:45:49.060
 But that was, I would say like my career in combat sports,

1:45:49.060 --> 1:45:51.260
 which spans, if you wanna go all the way back

1:45:51.260 --> 1:45:53.980
 to like wrestling, like that was one of probably

1:45:53.980 --> 1:45:56.400
 the greatest experiences I've been a part of.

1:45:57.940 --> 1:45:58.940
 It's a bittersweet sport.

1:45:58.940 --> 1:46:00.240
 She's a fickle mistress.

1:46:01.820 --> 1:46:06.060
 Yeah, I mean, the tragic aspect of that is

1:46:08.020 --> 1:46:10.580
 like, I guess Kyle lost, right?

1:46:10.580 --> 1:46:12.540
 So like if you look at the record

1:46:12.540 --> 1:46:14.140
 and all the kind of things,

1:46:14.140 --> 1:46:17.820
 perhaps like you look at the career,

1:46:17.820 --> 1:46:20.340
 maybe like as a financial,

1:46:21.940 --> 1:46:24.500
 from a financial perspective that perhaps is not

1:46:25.540 --> 1:46:28.340
 the greatest thing for Kyle's career

1:46:28.340 --> 1:46:32.140
 or that or in the history of the UFC,

1:46:32.140 --> 1:46:36.740
 perhaps it's not like maybe many people

1:46:36.740 --> 1:46:38.060
 didn't even watch that fight,

1:46:38.060 --> 1:46:40.860
 but it was a special moment that stands in the history.

1:46:40.860 --> 1:46:44.900
 There's not many of these in the history of fighting.

1:46:44.900 --> 1:46:45.780
 But at the end of the day,

1:46:45.780 --> 1:46:47.500
 when you look at someone's career in the UFC,

1:46:47.500 --> 1:46:52.500
 like financially, there's a handful of people

1:46:53.500 --> 1:46:54.820
 that make real money.

1:46:54.820 --> 1:46:56.540
 Everybody else makes nothing.

1:46:56.540 --> 1:46:58.740
 There's a handful of people that make real money.

1:46:58.740 --> 1:47:02.460
 So did that loss cost him in the near term?

1:47:02.460 --> 1:47:04.220
 Sure, but when you look back on your life,

1:47:04.220 --> 1:47:05.620
 you're not gonna look back on that loss

1:47:05.620 --> 1:47:07.740
 as something that derailed my life financially

1:47:07.740 --> 1:47:08.900
 and I never recovered from it.

1:47:08.900 --> 1:47:10.580
 That's not gonna happen.

1:47:10.580 --> 1:47:13.180
 Like the sad thing is, is unless you were a champion

1:47:13.180 --> 1:47:15.580
 and most people are gonna be forgotten

1:47:15.580 --> 1:47:16.960
 right after they're gone.

1:47:16.960 --> 1:47:18.220
 Most people will be forgotten.

1:47:18.220 --> 1:47:19.560
 And if you're not forgotten,

1:47:19.560 --> 1:47:22.520
 certainly your accolades are gonna be misrepresented.

1:47:22.520 --> 1:47:24.540
 Either they're gonna be inflated or diminished

1:47:24.540 --> 1:47:25.360
 one way or the other.

1:47:25.360 --> 1:47:30.360
 So looking back on it, it's just so hard to quantify that.

1:47:31.020 --> 1:47:32.340
 But it's an experience.

1:47:32.340 --> 1:47:34.540
 And when you're in that moment

1:47:34.540 --> 1:47:38.140
 and you're one of the people intimately involved in it,

1:47:38.140 --> 1:47:42.460
 the value of that experience supersedes any financial gain.

1:47:44.140 --> 1:47:46.860
 Where would you put Khabib

1:47:46.860 --> 1:47:48.620
 in the discussion of the greatest of all time?

1:47:48.620 --> 1:47:50.700
 So you recently, we worked together,

1:47:50.700 --> 1:47:55.700
 we watched the fight of him and Justin Gaethje

1:47:56.500 --> 1:47:58.740
 and Khabib retired.

1:47:58.740 --> 1:48:02.140
 Would you put him up there as one of the greatest

1:48:02.140 --> 1:48:05.620
 or did he never truly find his foil,

1:48:05.620 --> 1:48:08.500
 like the great warrior that challenged him?

1:48:08.500 --> 1:48:13.500
 And maybe do you think he's fully retired now?

1:48:13.660 --> 1:48:15.620
 To answer the question about being fully retired,

1:48:15.620 --> 1:48:16.660
 I don't have any idea.

1:48:16.660 --> 1:48:21.660
 I can't for a second pretend to think that I understand

1:48:22.660 --> 1:48:24.300
 the way that people from that part of the world

1:48:24.300 --> 1:48:26.900
 think and respect their family and things like that.

1:48:26.900 --> 1:48:27.840
 To an American who says,

1:48:27.840 --> 1:48:29.580
 oh, I promised my mom I wouldn't do it.

1:48:29.580 --> 1:48:31.660
 I mean, I promised my mom I wouldn't do a lot of things.

1:48:31.660 --> 1:48:33.940
 I went right out the fucking back door and did them.

1:48:33.940 --> 1:48:36.020
 But I think that that means something different

1:48:36.020 --> 1:48:37.940
 to people in different parts of the world.

1:48:37.940 --> 1:48:41.240
 So I have no idea what kind of weight that carries.

1:48:41.240 --> 1:48:42.780
 So I can't answer that.

1:48:42.780 --> 1:48:45.960
 I can say a lot of times when people think

1:48:45.960 --> 1:48:47.260
 about great fighters,

1:48:47.260 --> 1:48:50.540
 they think about the aspects that make up MMA.

1:48:50.540 --> 1:48:52.860
 Like they think of MMA as a pie

1:48:52.860 --> 1:48:56.300
 and they're all these different pieces that make up the pie.

1:48:56.300 --> 1:48:57.340
 And how good is this piece?

1:48:57.340 --> 1:48:58.160
 And how good is this piece?

1:48:58.160 --> 1:48:59.780
 And how good is this piece?

1:48:59.780 --> 1:49:00.960
 When the fact of the matter is

1:49:00.960 --> 1:49:05.260
 is you only need one really, really, really good piece.

1:49:05.260 --> 1:49:07.300
 And the other pieces are complimentary pieces

1:49:07.300 --> 1:49:10.540
 to get you to where you're the strongest.

1:49:10.540 --> 1:49:12.620
 And if you want to tell me

1:49:12.620 --> 1:49:14.820
 that Khabib's not the greatest MMA fighter

1:49:14.820 --> 1:49:17.820
 because he doesn't have really slick striking,

1:49:17.820 --> 1:49:19.180
 you can make that argument.

1:49:19.180 --> 1:49:22.160
 But what I can tell you is Khabib has good enough striking

1:49:22.160 --> 1:49:23.780
 to get him to his grappling

1:49:23.780 --> 1:49:27.360
 where he is clearly the best guy at 155 they've ever seen.

1:49:27.360 --> 1:49:29.100
 So does that make him the greatest fighter

1:49:29.100 --> 1:49:30.840
 in that division or not?

1:49:31.940 --> 1:49:33.520
 To your point about the foil,

1:49:33.520 --> 1:49:35.340
 they wanted Connor to be his foil

1:49:35.340 --> 1:49:37.080
 and he just manhandled them.

1:49:37.080 --> 1:49:39.320
 I mean, they wanted that to happen.

1:49:39.320 --> 1:49:40.240
 Did not happen.

1:49:40.240 --> 1:49:45.040
 Well, there's a kind of argument to be made which we kind of,

1:49:45.040 --> 1:49:47.800
 now you get haters in this argument

1:49:47.800 --> 1:49:50.160
 and you're going to be one of the haters

1:49:50.160 --> 1:49:53.280
 because I know your, how should I put it?

1:49:53.280 --> 1:49:57.320
 Lack of admiration for Connor McGregor.

1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:01.560
 But, what is it?

1:50:01.560 --> 1:50:03.160
 Football is a game of inches?

1:50:03.160 --> 1:50:03.980
 Yeah.

1:50:03.980 --> 1:50:08.920
 There's a sense where that Connor,

1:50:08.920 --> 1:50:10.340
 there's an argument to be made

1:50:10.340 --> 1:50:13.020
 that Connor wasn't exactly dominated,

1:50:13.020 --> 1:50:14.240
 that he ended up being dominant,

1:50:14.240 --> 1:50:16.680
 meaning, let me phrase it differently,

1:50:16.680 --> 1:50:20.280
 is there's a lot of points in the fight

1:50:20.280 --> 1:50:24.440
 that a different trajectory could have happened.

1:50:24.440 --> 1:50:27.460
 So he wasn't so far from having a chance

1:50:27.460 --> 1:50:28.600
 at winning that fight.

1:50:28.600 --> 1:50:30.280
 It's just the end.

1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:31.120
 You can focus.

1:50:31.120 --> 1:50:34.040
 Those are the most important moments at the end.

1:50:34.040 --> 1:50:35.740
 You've lost the most important moments.

1:50:35.740 --> 1:50:37.940
 Right, but the road less taken.

1:50:37.940 --> 1:50:39.400
 It could have been,

1:50:39.400 --> 1:50:42.640
 if he didn't lose those very important moments,

1:50:42.640 --> 1:50:43.560
 he had a chance.

1:50:43.560 --> 1:50:46.700
 I'm saying out of all the people that Khabib fought,

1:50:46.700 --> 1:50:49.080
 it's arguable that Connor was up there

1:50:49.080 --> 1:50:51.080
 of the people that had a chance.

1:50:51.080 --> 1:50:52.640
 Let me say this first.

1:50:54.960 --> 1:50:55.800
 I love.

1:50:55.800 --> 1:50:56.620
 I'm going to get so much heat for this.

1:50:56.620 --> 1:50:57.640
 I do love Khabib.

1:50:57.640 --> 1:50:59.080
 I'm a huge Khabib fan

1:50:59.080 --> 1:51:01.200
 because I'm a grappler first and foremost.

1:51:01.200 --> 1:51:03.020
 Me too, because I'm also Russian.

1:51:03.020 --> 1:51:05.280
 I love Khabib, calm down.

1:51:05.280 --> 1:51:06.120
 Okay.

1:51:06.120 --> 1:51:08.760
 When Connor came on the scene,

1:51:08.760 --> 1:51:10.800
 I loved Connor because I'm an Irish American

1:51:10.800 --> 1:51:12.800
 and I want to support him and things like that.

1:51:12.800 --> 1:51:14.540
 And he was good fun.

1:51:14.540 --> 1:51:17.920
 He got to be, for my personal taste,

1:51:17.920 --> 1:51:19.060
 he got to be too much.

1:51:20.020 --> 1:51:22.240
 Of all the people Khabib has fought,

1:51:22.240 --> 1:51:25.440
 I would never fight Connor again if I were him.

1:51:25.440 --> 1:51:26.480
 And here's why.

1:51:26.480 --> 1:51:28.280
 And I said this about the Diaz fight.

1:51:29.500 --> 1:51:32.240
 Nate Diaz, who was one of my favorite fighters,

1:51:32.240 --> 1:51:34.720
 has fought the exact same fight for 12 years.

1:51:34.720 --> 1:51:37.560
 Connor will switch something up to give himself an edge.

1:51:38.800 --> 1:51:41.440
 And I believe that Connor would figure something out

1:51:41.440 --> 1:51:43.800
 in fight number two, I think,

1:51:43.800 --> 1:51:46.460
 but I also thought that Gagey would give Khabib problems

1:51:46.460 --> 1:51:48.320
 where it wouldn't be a matter of

1:51:48.320 --> 1:51:49.800
 I'm going to out wrestle Khabib

1:51:49.800 --> 1:51:54.040
 or become better at defending his wrestling takedowns.

1:51:54.040 --> 1:51:56.520
 Connor would have figured out a way to not get wrestled.

1:51:56.520 --> 1:51:58.800
 I feel like he's constantly changing.

1:51:58.800 --> 1:52:00.440
 He's constantly evolving.

1:52:00.440 --> 1:52:02.520
 And whether or not people realize it or not,

1:52:02.520 --> 1:52:05.520
 I think Connor's one of the better overall athletes in MMA

1:52:05.520 --> 1:52:07.840
 just from looking at his body and his movement

1:52:07.840 --> 1:52:08.840
 and the way he's shaped.

1:52:08.840 --> 1:52:10.280
 He's got a very tiny waist.

1:52:10.280 --> 1:52:13.120
 He's got really pronounced glutes and shoulders.

1:52:13.120 --> 1:52:15.400
 And I think he's a for real athlete.

1:52:15.400 --> 1:52:17.560
 Whereas a lot of guys in MMA are not for real athletes.

1:52:17.560 --> 1:52:20.360
 They're just good at one of the things that makes up MMA.

1:52:21.400 --> 1:52:23.720
 I understand what you're saying about

1:52:23.720 --> 1:52:25.560
 if this happened, if that happened,

1:52:25.560 --> 1:52:26.520
 but I mean, you could say that

1:52:26.520 --> 1:52:29.700
 about every single combat sports event ever.

1:52:29.700 --> 1:52:32.280
 If Spinks's hook landed on Tyson,

1:52:32.280 --> 1:52:34.760
 maybe that fight didn't end the way that it did,

1:52:34.760 --> 1:52:35.840
 but you know what?

1:52:35.840 --> 1:52:36.920
 It didn't.

1:52:36.920 --> 1:52:37.800
 You're absolutely right.

1:52:37.800 --> 1:52:40.520
 But if we could talk about just Connor McGregor

1:52:40.520 --> 1:52:41.360
 for a second,

1:52:43.400 --> 1:52:46.340
 I can't wait to get your fan mail or hate mail.

1:52:47.840 --> 1:52:50.360
 Speak to the innovation of Connor.

1:52:50.360 --> 1:52:53.280
 I don't hear very many people making this argument,

1:52:54.240 --> 1:52:56.400
 but is it possible to make an argument

1:52:56.400 --> 1:52:58.680
 that Connor McGregor is one of the greatest fighters

1:52:58.680 --> 1:52:59.520
 of all time?

1:53:00.320 --> 1:53:01.480
 It's an interesting argument.

1:53:01.480 --> 1:53:03.840
 And the problem, the only problem with the argument

1:53:03.840 --> 1:53:06.040
 is there's so much emotion on either side.

1:53:06.040 --> 1:53:08.280
 Yeah, I had a conversation, sorry to interrupt,

1:53:08.280 --> 1:53:13.280
 with Yaron Brook, who is a philosopher,

1:53:13.640 --> 1:53:18.640
 objectivist, which is the philosophy of Ayn Rand.

1:53:18.860 --> 1:53:22.760
 And the amount of emotion around that particular human

1:53:22.760 --> 1:53:23.720
 is fascinating to me.

1:53:23.720 --> 1:53:27.320
 It's similar to the amount of emotion around Donald Trump.

1:53:27.320 --> 1:53:30.120
 You can think of different personalities, maybe Elon Musk.

1:53:30.120 --> 1:53:31.240
 Those are the people that aren't willing

1:53:31.240 --> 1:53:32.280
 to have their mind changed.

1:53:32.280 --> 1:53:34.640
 They're too emotionally attached to the argument.

1:53:34.640 --> 1:53:37.400
 Yeah, but it's weird that why do we,

1:53:37.400 --> 1:53:42.040
 why some people inspire so much emotion and others don't?

1:53:42.040 --> 1:53:46.040
 But Connor McGregor, I feel like nobody's able

1:53:46.040 --> 1:53:51.040
 to have a calm fight analysis of the guy.

1:53:52.220 --> 1:53:57.220
 Look, to me, as just a fan of martial arts,

1:53:57.220 --> 1:54:00.700
 like I studied judo, I love watching just hours

1:54:00.700 --> 1:54:04.500
 of Olympic judo and appreciating the art form.

1:54:04.500 --> 1:54:06.980
 Like I forget the humans involved.

1:54:06.980 --> 1:54:09.900
 Teddy Renner, who's a heavyweight,

1:54:09.900 --> 1:54:11.940
 the most probably the most dominant heavyweight

1:54:11.940 --> 1:54:14.620
 in the history of judo, just studying his gripping,

1:54:14.620 --> 1:54:16.180
 just the art of it.

1:54:16.180 --> 1:54:18.340
 And who cares if there's shit talking?

1:54:18.340 --> 1:54:21.860
 Like to me, I put all of that aside

1:54:21.860 --> 1:54:23.460
 and just look at the art.

1:54:23.460 --> 1:54:27.860
 And like what I really appreciate about Connor McGregor

1:54:27.860 --> 1:54:32.860
 is his innovation, like of movement,

1:54:33.540 --> 1:54:36.980
 of maybe it's romanticized, maybe you can correct me.

1:54:36.980 --> 1:54:41.620
 I'm just a Cheeto eating fan of mixed martial arts,

1:54:41.620 --> 1:54:45.340
 but like I seem to detect more innovation

1:54:45.340 --> 1:54:47.540
 than almost any other fighter

1:54:47.540 --> 1:54:51.660
 that I've paid attention to in Connor McGregor.

1:54:51.660 --> 1:54:54.180
 I think first, I'll answer in two parts.

1:54:54.180 --> 1:54:56.500
 I think, well, I'm not gonna answer the first part.

1:54:56.500 --> 1:54:58.720
 It's just a comment, because you didn't ask the question.

1:54:58.720 --> 1:54:59.560
 What was the question?

1:54:59.560 --> 1:55:00.780
 I don't even remember.

1:55:00.780 --> 1:55:04.740
 It's about how Connor McGregor fans are very emotional

1:55:04.740 --> 1:55:07.220
 and Connor McGregor detractors are very emotional.

1:55:07.220 --> 1:55:09.060
 I think fans become very emotional.

1:55:09.060 --> 1:55:11.340
 They become cheerleaders of someone like Connor McGregor

1:55:11.340 --> 1:55:13.860
 or Donald Trump, because they see that person

1:55:13.860 --> 1:55:16.780
 exhibiting the qualities that they themselves lack.

1:55:16.780 --> 1:55:18.500
 And so they become cheerleaders for that, right?

1:55:18.500 --> 1:55:20.860
 And I think that for the most part,

1:55:20.860 --> 1:55:23.380
 people who are detractors of Connor McGregors,

1:55:23.380 --> 1:55:25.700
 they're not really Connor McGregor detractors.

1:55:25.700 --> 1:55:28.340
 They're detractors of Connor supporters.

1:55:28.340 --> 1:55:29.660
 There's a beef that they have

1:55:29.660 --> 1:55:31.380
 with the people in that bucket, right?

1:55:31.380 --> 1:55:33.620
 Like, it's not really a problem.

1:55:33.620 --> 1:55:37.380
 And that applies probably in our current political climate,

1:55:37.380 --> 1:55:39.460
 Donald Trump with the left and the right.

1:55:39.460 --> 1:55:44.340
 It's more about like, they actually don't like

1:55:44.340 --> 1:55:47.420
 on the other, the caricature, the most extreme versions

1:55:47.420 --> 1:55:50.380
 of what they see in the supporters of the other side.

1:55:50.380 --> 1:55:51.220
 Yeah, that's a good point.

1:55:51.220 --> 1:55:52.460
 But I think the more interesting thing

1:55:52.460 --> 1:55:53.540
 is the fighter himself.

1:55:53.540 --> 1:55:55.220
 So let's put the supporters aside.

1:55:55.220 --> 1:55:59.580
 I would say that, you know, what some people know

1:55:59.580 --> 1:56:01.180
 and some people don't know is that Connor's base

1:56:01.180 --> 1:56:06.180
 is in karate and the karate style of Connor McGregor,

1:56:06.540 --> 1:56:10.620
 Steven Thompson, of Lyoto Machida,

1:56:10.620 --> 1:56:12.660
 that type of distance management,

1:56:12.660 --> 1:56:14.540
 a lot of times we think as martial artists,

1:56:14.540 --> 1:56:17.460
 we think that the sport version of the art

1:56:17.460 --> 1:56:21.060
 we've chosen to pursue somehow taints the authenticity

1:56:21.060 --> 1:56:24.020
 and the effectiveness of it.

1:56:24.020 --> 1:56:26.020
 But point karate is what led to that

1:56:26.020 --> 1:56:28.940
 in and out distance management style of Connor,

1:56:28.940 --> 1:56:31.100
 of Lyoto and of Steven Thompson.

1:56:31.100 --> 1:56:33.420
 They all kind of use it a little bit differently,

1:56:33.420 --> 1:56:36.260
 but they use it very effectively, all three of them.

1:56:36.260 --> 1:56:41.180
 And that comes from a world of trying to kind of like

1:56:41.180 --> 1:56:43.860
 step in, land contact on you from my point

1:56:43.860 --> 1:56:47.380
 and then get back out before you can counterstrike me, right?

1:56:47.380 --> 1:56:49.020
 And that's where that comes from.

1:56:49.020 --> 1:56:52.380
 Connor is blessed to have a longer arms

1:56:52.380 --> 1:56:54.580
 than someone his height probably normally has.

1:56:54.580 --> 1:56:57.700
 And his movement is just so fluid.

1:56:57.700 --> 1:57:01.540
 He's so athletic with the hinges of his body,

1:57:01.540 --> 1:57:04.820
 the knees and the hips and the swivel of his body,

1:57:04.820 --> 1:57:06.820
 which is also the hips and the shoulders.

1:57:07.780 --> 1:57:09.900
 His movement, his distance,

1:57:09.900 --> 1:57:12.740
 and the way he sets people up for the straight left hand

1:57:12.740 --> 1:57:14.220
 while you're circling away from it

1:57:14.220 --> 1:57:15.140
 and he can still land it,

1:57:15.140 --> 1:57:17.060
 which is what he did to Chad Mendes.

1:57:17.060 --> 1:57:17.980
 Hit him with a straight left

1:57:17.980 --> 1:57:20.100
 while he was circling away from it.

1:57:20.100 --> 1:57:24.060
 That is something that is very beautiful to watch.

1:57:24.060 --> 1:57:27.100
 And sometimes people see the kicks

1:57:27.100 --> 1:57:30.740
 and they see all the flashy snap kicks and the sidekicks.

1:57:30.740 --> 1:57:32.860
 All that stuff is doing is setting people up

1:57:32.860 --> 1:57:34.140
 for the left hand.

1:57:34.140 --> 1:57:34.980
 It's all it's doing.

1:57:34.980 --> 1:57:37.140
 It's you're corralling people, you're funneling people,

1:57:37.140 --> 1:57:39.140
 or you're leading the dance and you're bringing them

1:57:39.140 --> 1:57:41.740
 to a spot where you know you can land that left hand.

1:57:41.740 --> 1:57:45.780
 And his ability to do that is masterful.

1:57:45.780 --> 1:57:48.820
 People constantly shit on his ability to grapple

1:57:48.820 --> 1:57:50.020
 because a couple of his losses

1:57:50.020 --> 1:57:52.860
 have been to jujitsu guys or grapplers,

1:57:52.860 --> 1:57:55.380
 but they've been to really good guys.

1:57:55.380 --> 1:57:56.780
 Anyone who's gonna sit here and tell me

1:57:56.780 --> 1:58:00.180
 Conor McGregor's not a good grappler, go grapple him.

1:58:00.180 --> 1:58:02.020
 Let me see you grapple him.

1:58:02.020 --> 1:58:05.020
 To that point, I'll also say a lot of people

1:58:05.020 --> 1:58:08.380
 will use Conor McGregor's X guard sweep on Nate Diaz

1:58:08.380 --> 1:58:11.500
 as evidence to his high level grappling in that fight,

1:58:11.500 --> 1:58:13.460
 to which I would also counter,

1:58:13.460 --> 1:58:14.780
 Nate Diaz didn't fight that off

1:58:14.780 --> 1:58:16.820
 because he knew he was so much better at jujitsu

1:58:16.820 --> 1:58:19.660
 off the bottom that he didn't even care if he got swept.

1:58:19.660 --> 1:58:21.860
 So is Conor McGregor innovative?

1:58:21.860 --> 1:58:22.700
 Absolutely.

1:58:23.780 --> 1:58:25.540
 Is he one of the best fighters ever?

1:58:25.540 --> 1:58:27.580
 It's tough to say because he's such a cash cow

1:58:27.580 --> 1:58:28.940
 that he was fed people.

1:58:28.940 --> 1:58:32.700
 I firmly believe no one who put

1:58:32.700 --> 1:58:34.420
 that Conor McGregor Khabib fight together

1:58:34.420 --> 1:58:35.620
 thought Khabib would win.

1:58:36.620 --> 1:58:38.140
 Wow.

1:58:38.140 --> 1:58:42.940
 I remember, so at that time it was not completely clear.

1:58:42.940 --> 1:58:45.220
 There was a myth of the great Khabib.

1:58:45.220 --> 1:58:48.420
 It wasn't completely clear how good is he really.

1:58:48.420 --> 1:58:49.820
 So that's interesting.

1:58:49.820 --> 1:58:53.140
 And it was unclear how good is Conor also.

1:58:55.500 --> 1:58:57.780
 Because I think to me,

1:58:57.780 --> 1:59:00.500
 maybe part of my admiration of Conor McGregor

1:59:00.500 --> 1:59:02.340
 is rooted in the fact that I thought

1:59:02.340 --> 1:59:05.300
 there was no way he beats Jose Aldo

1:59:05.300 --> 1:59:07.660
 and I thought there's definitely no way

1:59:07.660 --> 1:59:09.140
 he beats Eddie Alvarez.

1:59:09.140 --> 1:59:10.740
 And so like when he did,

1:59:10.740 --> 1:59:15.740
 I was like, my brain was like,

1:59:17.060 --> 1:59:18.060
 there's something broken.

1:59:18.060 --> 1:59:20.220
 It was like shut down, like on windows, like froze.

1:59:20.220 --> 1:59:21.740
 We have to rethink this.

1:59:21.740 --> 1:59:23.380
 Like this is a special human.

1:59:23.380 --> 1:59:25.780
 Now people who argue he's not even in the running

1:59:25.780 --> 1:59:28.340
 of like top 20 is,

1:59:28.340 --> 1:59:30.380
 if you look at the number of defenses, for example,

1:59:30.380 --> 1:59:32.660
 of his belt that he had very, very little.

1:59:32.660 --> 1:59:34.580
 But like to me, I'm one of those people

1:59:34.580 --> 1:59:36.540
 is back to our discussion of like,

1:59:36.540 --> 1:59:38.340
 do moments make great fighters?

1:59:38.340 --> 1:59:41.300
 That I think just being able to beat Jose Aldo

1:59:41.300 --> 1:59:43.300
 and I would argue in his prime,

1:59:43.300 --> 1:59:45.780
 some people might disagree in this,

1:59:49.020 --> 1:59:51.820
 in a way where he like figures out the puzzle,

1:59:51.820 --> 1:59:53.940
 gets in his head the entirety of the picture.

1:59:53.940 --> 1:59:57.580
 And then to be, I mean, Eddie Alvarez,

1:59:57.580 --> 2:00:00.500
 would he be considered a really strong wrestler?

2:00:00.500 --> 2:00:04.260
 Like, or not strong wrestler,

2:00:04.260 --> 2:00:05.700
 strong striker and wrestler,

2:00:05.700 --> 2:00:06.740
 the whole combination of it.

2:00:06.740 --> 2:00:09.340
 And also what's the other wrestler he fought?

2:00:09.340 --> 2:00:10.660
 Chad Mendes. Chad Mendes.

2:00:10.660 --> 2:00:13.500
 So let me comment on all those if I may.

2:00:13.500 --> 2:00:15.700
 So I was at the Chad Mendes fight live.

2:00:15.700 --> 2:00:18.820
 And there was a jujitsu tournament, we're out in Vegas.

2:00:18.820 --> 2:00:20.180
 And so me and my best friend came out

2:00:20.180 --> 2:00:21.420
 and we got some tickets.

2:00:21.420 --> 2:00:24.300
 That night was supposed to be the first Aldo fight.

2:00:24.300 --> 2:00:27.300
 Aldo got hurt, like right after I bought the tickets.

2:00:27.300 --> 2:00:28.700
 They pulled Chad Mendes in.

2:00:28.700 --> 2:00:30.380
 He was a little bit out of shape, whatever.

2:00:30.380 --> 2:00:32.340
 You still got to fight the fight.

2:00:32.340 --> 2:00:36.900
 But I don't want to use that fight as evidence

2:00:36.900 --> 2:00:39.700
 to Conor's greatness because they pulled Chad Mendes in.

2:00:39.700 --> 2:00:41.860
 He was like hunting and drinking beers in the woods

2:00:41.860 --> 2:00:43.460
 and was a little out of shape.

2:00:43.460 --> 2:00:45.420
 But if you want to talk about greatness,

2:00:45.420 --> 2:00:49.820
 like that surpasses your in ring accomplishments.

2:00:50.860 --> 2:00:52.740
 I was in the stands that night

2:00:52.740 --> 2:00:56.420
 and the people that came from Ireland

2:00:56.420 --> 2:00:58.060
 to see Conor fight that night,

2:00:58.060 --> 2:01:00.740
 single handedly set the market

2:01:00.740 --> 2:01:03.820
 for hotel room prices and airline tickets to Vegas

2:01:03.820 --> 2:01:05.140
 that weekend.

2:01:05.140 --> 2:01:07.980
 These motherfuckers were all dressed like Conor

2:01:07.980 --> 2:01:09.020
 in the stands.

2:01:09.020 --> 2:01:11.580
 They had wool suits on and big beards

2:01:11.580 --> 2:01:12.420
 and the whole thing.

2:01:12.420 --> 2:01:14.540
 I mean, they probably weren't pocket watches.

2:01:14.540 --> 2:01:19.100
 I never saw more people trying to be someone else.

2:01:19.100 --> 2:01:21.580
 Never saw more people try to be someone else.

2:01:21.580 --> 2:01:23.060
 I mean, there's a level of,

2:01:23.060 --> 2:01:24.540
 is there a level of greatness in that?

2:01:24.540 --> 2:01:26.700
 I mean, I don't know how to parse all that out.

2:01:26.700 --> 2:01:28.420
 You're somebody who doesn't admire that.

2:01:28.420 --> 2:01:31.700
 I love that in the sense, the following sense, I think.

2:01:31.700 --> 2:01:34.540
 And people don't seem to hold this belief at all,

2:01:34.540 --> 2:01:36.980
 but to me, fighting is not just,

2:01:37.900 --> 2:01:42.580
 this isn't like a quiet street fight that nobody watches.

2:01:42.580 --> 2:01:43.820
 This is also a spectacle.

2:01:43.820 --> 2:01:45.580
 This is also a story.

2:01:45.580 --> 2:01:48.460
 There's like, there's a professional wrestling element

2:01:48.460 --> 2:01:49.300
 to this.

2:01:49.300 --> 2:01:51.540
 This is not, like you think it's just about fighting.

2:01:51.540 --> 2:01:54.220
 If it was just about fighting, you wouldn't,

2:01:54.220 --> 2:01:56.780
 I mean, there's a story to it, I guess,

2:01:56.780 --> 2:01:58.580
 is what I'm trying to get to.

2:01:58.580 --> 2:02:01.300
 And greatness has to incorporate that.

2:02:01.300 --> 2:02:04.300
 People that criticize, again, I might be wrong on this,

2:02:04.300 --> 2:02:07.620
 but I honestly think that Conor McGregor,

2:02:07.620 --> 2:02:10.060
 not nearly as much as Khabib,

2:02:10.060 --> 2:02:13.460
 but he's a true martial artist.

2:02:13.460 --> 2:02:17.580
 I think he respects his opponents despite the talk.

2:02:17.580 --> 2:02:19.220
 Maybe I'm misreading it,

2:02:19.220 --> 2:02:22.260
 but it feels like he is a storyteller,

2:02:22.260 --> 2:02:27.020
 like Chael Sonnen type of like, he's constructed this image

2:02:27.020 --> 2:02:30.060
 to play the story, like just the way he acts

2:02:30.060 --> 2:02:33.540
 after the fight, the honor he shows to his opponents.

2:02:33.540 --> 2:02:35.980
 There's a real martial artist in there,

2:02:35.980 --> 2:02:40.980
 and to dismiss the fact that the story of the fight

2:02:41.820 --> 2:02:44.340
 is part of it, because he doesn't just shit talk.

2:02:44.340 --> 2:02:46.500
 This is what people don't seem to understand.

2:02:46.500 --> 2:02:48.300
 He's good at shit talking.

2:02:48.300 --> 2:02:52.420
 Very good, and I'm with you on basically everything you said.

2:02:53.380 --> 2:02:55.060
 I think that there's greatness to that,

2:02:55.060 --> 2:02:57.940
 and I think that he understands how to sell a fight,

2:02:57.940 --> 2:03:02.940
 and I think what he did to Jose Aldo by getting in his head

2:03:05.620 --> 2:03:06.940
 helped him win that fight.

2:03:08.620 --> 2:03:12.180
 He insulted Jose Aldo and his country so much

2:03:12.180 --> 2:03:14.380
 that he knew Aldo was gonna come forward

2:03:14.380 --> 2:03:15.660
 right into that left hook.

2:03:15.660 --> 2:03:17.420
 Was that fight in Brazil, by the way?

2:03:17.420 --> 2:03:18.260
 Do you remember?

2:03:18.260 --> 2:03:19.100
 I don't recall.

2:03:19.100 --> 2:03:20.540
 Because I know he insulted all of Brazil,

2:03:20.540 --> 2:03:22.460
 but I'm not sure if it was in Brazil.

2:03:22.460 --> 2:03:23.940
 But when he tried to do that to Khabib,

2:03:23.940 --> 2:03:25.420
 you could tell that he just was not gonna get

2:03:25.420 --> 2:03:26.260
 in Khabib's head.

2:03:26.260 --> 2:03:27.820
 Khabib was unflappable.

2:03:27.820 --> 2:03:30.780
 But there is definitely something great

2:03:30.780 --> 2:03:33.420
 about how he moves people.

2:03:33.420 --> 2:03:37.660
 The Irish are like, I mean, Conor's walkout music,

2:03:37.660 --> 2:03:41.260
 for people from Ireland of Irish descent,

2:03:41.260 --> 2:03:43.580
 that shit is like very deep.

2:03:43.580 --> 2:03:47.740
 You know, it's a very emotional song.

2:03:47.740 --> 2:03:51.500
 I was, to be honest, a little bit upset with Khabib,

2:03:51.500 --> 2:03:54.180
 that he didn't rise.

2:03:54.180 --> 2:03:56.780
 I admire that entire culture.

2:03:56.780 --> 2:03:59.300
 But there's an aspect to where he could have risen

2:03:59.300 --> 2:04:03.940
 to the occasion of there's the same kind of depth

2:04:03.940 --> 2:04:08.300
 of love of country that Russia has.

2:04:10.140 --> 2:04:11.780
 Is there in Dagestan?

2:04:11.780 --> 2:04:15.060
 Dagestan is a little weird in terms of like,

2:04:15.060 --> 2:04:18.340
 but he could have, especially with Putin's support,

2:04:18.340 --> 2:04:22.220
 wear for a bit the full Russian hat

2:04:22.220 --> 2:04:23.980
 of like this is the great nation.

2:04:23.980 --> 2:04:28.260
 Like rise above the culture of Dagestan,

2:04:28.260 --> 2:04:31.100
 which is a small town boy with the small town values

2:04:31.100 --> 2:04:33.080
 of family and all those kinds of things.

2:04:33.080 --> 2:04:36.620
 There's a moment where you inspire entire nations.

2:04:36.620 --> 2:04:40.340
 Like the step up and be the foil

2:04:40.340 --> 2:04:45.340
 to the great Conor McGregor where also Khabib

2:04:45.900 --> 2:04:48.780
 becomes the foil to, like both of them

2:04:48.780 --> 2:04:51.440
 are the foil to each other and become like,

2:04:51.440 --> 2:04:54.500
 that fight was already a great fight, right?

2:04:54.500 --> 2:04:57.060
 But it could have been something historic.

2:04:57.060 --> 2:05:00.340
 Ali versus Fred, I mean, it could have been really historic.

2:05:00.340 --> 2:05:05.340
 And I would argue, I guess the biggest disappointment I have,

2:05:05.620 --> 2:05:08.700
 and I understand it and I also honor it as a martial artist,

2:05:08.700 --> 2:05:13.300
 but to, I'm disappointed that Khabib doesn't seem

2:05:13.300 --> 2:05:17.700
 to even consider the possibility of doing in Moscow

2:05:18.580 --> 2:05:23.580
 fight number two, and because that could be narrative wise

2:05:23.580 --> 2:05:26.100
 if they do it right, that's one of the,

2:05:26.100 --> 2:05:29.420
 could be one of the greatest fights in history.

2:05:29.420 --> 2:05:34.420
 Yeah, I think in terms of Khabib and inspiring a country,

2:05:34.420 --> 2:05:39.420
 is it possible that by staying true to the values

2:05:39.740 --> 2:05:44.260
 that he had his entire career and getting to the zenith

2:05:44.260 --> 2:05:49.120
 of his art form and still doing it in that humble way,

2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:50.940
 isn't it possible that that inspires?

2:05:50.940 --> 2:05:55.020
 Yeah, 100%, so I should clarify that I think

2:05:55.020 --> 2:05:56.900
 they're just hearing from people,

2:05:56.900 --> 2:06:01.900
 from my fellow comrades, no, is they love that.

2:06:01.900 --> 2:06:05.260
 They love that, but they.

2:06:06.700 --> 2:06:09.420
 There's also a brash, beer chugging, shit talking thing

2:06:09.420 --> 2:06:12.500
 that people really like about Connor, and I do love that.

2:06:12.500 --> 2:06:15.300
 But the beautiful narrative would have been the clash,

2:06:15.300 --> 2:06:17.220
 the real clash of those cultures.

2:06:17.220 --> 2:06:22.220
 So Khabib chooses to live the culture by walking away.

2:06:23.340 --> 2:06:27.540
 There's also like a clash of them sort of walking,

2:06:27.540 --> 2:06:31.580
 not walking away from the fire, but walking into the fire

2:06:31.580 --> 2:06:33.740
 of this brashness.

2:06:33.740 --> 2:06:38.740
 It's the sort of the cool collected calmness

2:06:40.020 --> 2:06:41.660
 of the Dagestan people.

2:06:41.660 --> 2:06:43.740
 It's like you were talking about the Saitya brothers.

2:06:43.740 --> 2:06:46.580
 So they just view it totally differently.

2:06:46.580 --> 2:06:50.140
 And there are stereotypes about the Irish

2:06:50.140 --> 2:06:52.800
 where they're maybe potentially a louder,

2:06:52.800 --> 2:06:54.700
 more boisterous culture.

2:06:55.660 --> 2:06:57.420
 Haven't heard of that, yeah.

2:06:57.420 --> 2:07:01.700
 And I mean, I thought they each played their part perfectly.

2:07:01.700 --> 2:07:04.780
 And all those things that you're describing

2:07:04.780 --> 2:07:05.620
 could have happened.

2:07:05.620 --> 2:07:08.340
 Maybe Khabib steps up and he carries the proverbial flag,

2:07:08.340 --> 2:07:10.940
 so to speak, for a nation of people and they go to battle.

2:07:10.940 --> 2:07:12.740
 But the fight, if it plays out the same way,

2:07:12.740 --> 2:07:13.980
 is still the fight.

2:07:13.980 --> 2:07:16.540
 And it was an okay fight.

2:07:16.540 --> 2:07:17.940
 It wasn't a great fight.

2:07:17.940 --> 2:07:21.180
 It was, you know, the fight was okay.

2:07:21.180 --> 2:07:26.100
 And I think that, again, I don't have any idea

2:07:26.100 --> 2:07:28.820
 what Khabib's obligations to his family are.

2:07:28.820 --> 2:07:33.820
 I don't think either of those guys want for more money.

2:07:34.100 --> 2:07:38.000
 To do another fight is just a legacy thing.

2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:43.000
 It's just about fulfilling some part of a legacy.

2:07:44.180 --> 2:07:49.180
 And I just, I admire the possibility of a great legacy

2:07:49.580 --> 2:07:51.860
 that is bigger than either of the fighters.

2:07:51.860 --> 2:07:56.380
 I think with Khabib, he kind of, he's not as concerned

2:07:56.380 --> 2:07:57.460
 about legacy, I think.

2:07:57.460 --> 2:07:58.300
 Right.

2:07:58.300 --> 2:07:59.140
 There's a...

2:07:59.140 --> 2:08:01.900
 Your promoter's dream, because you want the rematch,

2:08:01.900 --> 2:08:03.220
 and the only thing that makes more money

2:08:03.220 --> 2:08:05.540
 than the rematch is the trilogy.

2:08:05.540 --> 2:08:09.020
 You gotta split the rematch, you hope Conor wins,

2:08:09.020 --> 2:08:10.500
 and then you have the trilogy fight.

2:08:10.500 --> 2:08:11.820
 And now you're all in.

2:08:11.820 --> 2:08:13.020
 Yeah.

2:08:13.020 --> 2:08:15.340
 Yeah, I can't get into Khabib's head,

2:08:15.340 --> 2:08:19.380
 but I know Putin, just the game, the entirety of it,

2:08:19.380 --> 2:08:20.340
 especially at the time,

2:08:20.340 --> 2:08:22.340
 especially if it was Trump as president,

2:08:24.340 --> 2:08:26.420
 if he was as president at the time,

2:08:26.420 --> 2:08:30.280
 and Putin, and in Russia,

2:08:30.280 --> 2:08:34.540
 and just knowing how masterful Conor is at,

2:08:35.460 --> 2:08:37.420
 because Conor would be a different Conor.

2:08:37.420 --> 2:08:39.300
 I think he would be a calmer Conor.

2:08:39.300 --> 2:08:40.660
 There would be a different,

2:08:42.060 --> 2:08:43.820
 because you don't wanna be over the top Conor

2:08:43.820 --> 2:08:44.860
 with the Russian people.

2:08:44.860 --> 2:08:46.700
 Right, no, that's...

2:08:46.700 --> 2:08:48.740
 It's like, ah, this is dangerous ground.

2:08:48.740 --> 2:08:53.420
 See, that was the episode in the hotel in Brooklyn

2:08:53.420 --> 2:08:58.420
 when some of the Russian guys confronted Artem,

2:08:58.420 --> 2:09:00.140
 and then Conor came over.

2:09:00.140 --> 2:09:02.520
 It's not, but the danger of that.

2:09:02.520 --> 2:09:05.940
 I mean, there is the element of just like real danger,

2:09:05.940 --> 2:09:08.340
 and the real, it was almost of war.

2:09:08.340 --> 2:09:11.260
 It's, I don't know, it's...

2:09:11.260 --> 2:09:14.940
 It was like when Chael Sonnen was talking so much smack,

2:09:14.940 --> 2:09:17.380
 maybe it was against Vanderlei Silva.

2:09:17.380 --> 2:09:18.860
 I don't know, and it was one of those fights

2:09:18.860 --> 2:09:20.280
 where they just didn't think he was gonna make it

2:09:20.280 --> 2:09:21.120
 out of Brazil.

2:09:21.120 --> 2:09:21.940
 Yeah.

2:09:21.940 --> 2:09:22.900
 Yeah.

2:09:22.900 --> 2:09:24.540
 Americans don't get it.

2:09:24.540 --> 2:09:25.380
 Yeah.

2:09:25.380 --> 2:09:26.880
 People take some of that shit in different parts

2:09:26.880 --> 2:09:28.620
 of the world very, very seriously.

2:09:28.620 --> 2:09:30.420
 Yeah, but that's what makes it beautiful.

2:09:30.420 --> 2:09:32.740
 That's what makes a great story,

2:09:32.740 --> 2:09:35.620
 and I think fighting is very much about the stories,

2:09:35.620 --> 2:09:39.700
 not just about the particular outcomes of a fight,

2:09:39.700 --> 2:09:43.840
 or the skillset matching, or the chess of the fight.

2:09:43.840 --> 2:09:47.500
 It's also about the story of the greater,

2:09:47.500 --> 2:09:51.740
 like context of societies, of warring.

2:09:51.740 --> 2:09:54.220
 We're like warring cultures, but we're still,

2:09:54.220 --> 2:09:58.180
 we're still good, we're no longer can have great,

2:09:58.180 --> 2:10:03.100
 big, hot wars between nations because of nuclear weapons.

2:10:03.100 --> 2:10:05.500
 This is our wars that we can have,

2:10:05.500 --> 2:10:09.540
 and in some sense, I feel robbed of the great war

2:10:09.540 --> 2:10:11.020
 that could have happened.

2:10:11.020 --> 2:10:13.780
 It doesn't mean there aren't lots of wars going on,

2:10:13.780 --> 2:10:16.060
 but yeah, the big one is not gonna happen.

2:10:16.060 --> 2:10:17.320
 There's too much of a balance of power

2:10:17.320 --> 2:10:20.220
 with nuclear weapons and technology and stuff,

2:10:20.220 --> 2:10:23.220
 but it's not the end of war.

2:10:23.220 --> 2:10:24.220
 No.

2:10:24.220 --> 2:10:27.020
 Do you think there's always gonna be war?

2:10:27.020 --> 2:10:28.420
 I think there'll always be war,

2:10:28.420 --> 2:10:30.820
 especially in underdeveloped parts of the world.

2:10:31.780 --> 2:10:33.340
 Isn't there always underdeveloped,

2:10:33.340 --> 2:10:35.420
 relatively, parts of the world?

2:10:35.420 --> 2:10:37.420
 Yeah, I mean, at some point, though, you'd think,

2:10:37.420 --> 2:10:40.780
 I mean, the way that technology's expanding

2:10:40.780 --> 2:10:43.440
 and we're bringing technology to weird parts of the world

2:10:43.440 --> 2:10:47.940
 that you wouldn't think of as technologically advanced,

2:10:47.940 --> 2:10:51.500
 the way that the Chinese are inhabiting certain areas

2:10:51.500 --> 2:10:54.340
 for mining purposes and things like that,

2:10:54.340 --> 2:10:57.340
 I think underdeveloped parts of the world

2:10:57.340 --> 2:10:59.540
 will get developed quickly.

2:10:59.540 --> 2:11:02.060
 I just wonder what the nature of that war might be.

2:11:02.060 --> 2:11:04.300
 It could be cyber, it could be all those kinds of things.

2:11:04.300 --> 2:11:06.380
 I think in developed nations, it's gonna be cyber.

2:11:06.380 --> 2:11:08.300
 I think that's probably the next phase of war,

2:11:08.300 --> 2:11:10.040
 but I mean, I think you talk about parts of the world

2:11:10.040 --> 2:11:10.880
 like the Middle East,

2:11:10.880 --> 2:11:13.580
 and it's just still gonna be warring tribal factions.

2:11:13.580 --> 2:11:15.380
 We can't even begin to understand

2:11:15.380 --> 2:11:17.620
 what those people are fighting about over there.

2:11:17.620 --> 2:11:20.180
 Yet, everyone sitting in America on their couch

2:11:20.180 --> 2:11:21.120
 has an opinion.

2:11:22.620 --> 2:11:24.280
 You can't even begin to understand it.

2:11:24.280 --> 2:11:25.580
 I sure can't.

2:11:25.580 --> 2:11:27.980
 Yeah, it's back to the principle discussion,

2:11:29.300 --> 2:11:31.420
 when what's violated is much deeper

2:11:31.420 --> 2:11:35.200
 than just kind of anything we can even,

2:11:35.200 --> 2:11:38.500
 in a middle class existence, can even comprehend.

2:11:38.500 --> 2:11:40.420
 A lot of times, American soldiers will go to war

2:11:40.420 --> 2:11:41.700
 because that's what they're told to do,

2:11:41.700 --> 2:11:43.460
 and maybe they disagree with the orders,

2:11:43.460 --> 2:11:44.620
 and maybe they agree with the orders,

2:11:44.620 --> 2:11:48.140
 but I get a sense that people in the Middle East fighting

2:11:48.140 --> 2:11:49.920
 all believe in what they're fighting for.

2:11:49.920 --> 2:11:53.060
 It's not a thing where they're told to go do it.

2:11:53.060 --> 2:11:56.100
 I believe they really believe

2:11:56.100 --> 2:11:57.460
 that what they're doing is the right thing,

2:11:57.460 --> 2:11:59.940
 and they're defending some sort of principle.

2:11:59.940 --> 2:12:03.740
 Are you generally optimistic about the future,

2:12:03.740 --> 2:12:05.660
 speaking of war, of human civilization?

2:12:05.660 --> 2:12:10.660
 Do you think we'll, people talk about the Fermi Paradox

2:12:13.740 --> 2:12:17.020
 and asking why haven't aliens visited us,

2:12:17.020 --> 2:12:19.180
 if you believe they haven't visited us.

2:12:21.220 --> 2:12:25.340
 One of the thoughts is that there's kind of a great filter

2:12:25.340 --> 2:12:29.220
 that intelligent civilization reach a point

2:12:29.220 --> 2:12:31.180
 where it destroys itself naturally,

2:12:31.180 --> 2:12:32.420
 so that's why we haven't seen them.

2:12:32.420 --> 2:12:34.320
 They don't last very long.

2:12:34.320 --> 2:12:36.580
 There does seem to be a kind of,

2:12:37.580 --> 2:12:39.720
 we seem to be advancing faster and faster and faster.

2:12:39.720 --> 2:12:41.660
 We keep developing more and more powerful ways

2:12:41.660 --> 2:12:44.060
 of destroying ourselves in all kinds of ways,

2:12:44.060 --> 2:12:48.820
 not even, just even to say nuclear weapons alone,

2:12:48.820 --> 2:12:50.940
 but there's all kinds of new ways,

2:12:50.940 --> 2:12:55.940
 engineer pandemics, nanotechnology, AGI,

2:12:57.100 --> 2:12:58.400
 all those kinds of things.

2:12:58.400 --> 2:13:03.400
 It seems to be that the argument that we are going

2:13:06.880 --> 2:13:09.080
 to destroy ourselves in some kind of creative way

2:13:09.080 --> 2:13:13.840
 very shortly is not too crazy of an argument to make.

2:13:13.840 --> 2:13:16.840
 Are you more optimistic or pessimistic

2:13:16.840 --> 2:13:18.960
 about the prospects of human civilization

2:13:18.960 --> 2:13:21.400
 in maybe the 22nd century?

2:13:21.400 --> 2:13:23.720
 Like, is it possible that your generation

2:13:23.720 --> 2:13:26.440
 is the last generation to be alive on Earth?

2:13:26.440 --> 2:13:28.920
 No, but I wouldn't say that five generations

2:13:28.920 --> 2:13:31.200
 from now that could be true.

2:13:32.140 --> 2:13:34.360
 I guess I think of it really selfishly.

2:13:34.360 --> 2:13:38.300
 I'm a big believer that when your time here on Earth is over,

2:13:39.400 --> 2:13:42.400
 the overwhelmingly vast majority of people

2:13:42.400 --> 2:13:44.920
 will be forgotten within 12 calendar months.

2:13:44.920 --> 2:13:47.840
 People with no family will be forgotten sooner,

2:13:47.840 --> 2:13:49.340
 and so I don't give a lot of thought

2:13:49.340 --> 2:13:52.400
 to what will happen to Earth or mankind when I'm gone.

2:13:52.400 --> 2:13:55.960
 I give more thought to maximizing my time here now,

2:13:55.960 --> 2:13:59.540
 and I wanna do it in a way where I don't,

2:14:01.800 --> 2:14:04.640
 I'm not overtly hindering the future of civilization

2:14:04.640 --> 2:14:09.140
 or humankind, but I'm definitely taking a me first approach

2:14:09.140 --> 2:14:10.760
 to how I live on Earth.

2:14:10.760 --> 2:14:13.500
 Do you have a philosophy behind why you have

2:14:13.500 --> 2:14:16.720
 or don't have kids on this topic?

2:14:16.720 --> 2:14:19.000
 Because for many people, when they have kids,

2:14:20.220 --> 2:14:23.960
 there's a sense, it's almost like a genetic sense

2:14:23.960 --> 2:14:26.440
 or something like that, where all of a sudden,

2:14:26.440 --> 2:14:28.240
 you do start caring about what happens

2:14:28.240 --> 2:14:29.540
 five generations from now.

2:14:30.840 --> 2:14:32.940
 I mean, I think I'm just too selfish.

2:14:34.120 --> 2:14:37.600
 I mean, I think that's the easy answer.

2:14:37.600 --> 2:14:40.440
 Like, I know that your whole life has to change.

2:14:40.440 --> 2:14:43.760
 You know, your focus, everything shifts,

2:14:43.760 --> 2:14:45.960
 and just don't wanna do that.

2:14:45.960 --> 2:14:48.480
 And also, I think that there's a level of,

2:14:48.480 --> 2:14:51.520
 I guess if I have to really unpack it,

2:14:51.520 --> 2:14:56.400
 there's probably a level of lack of hope in the future.

2:14:56.400 --> 2:14:59.400
 Like, I don't think it's, I don't think the world

2:14:59.400 --> 2:15:02.460
 and humanity is going in the right direction.

2:15:02.460 --> 2:15:04.760
 What does the right direction look like?

2:15:04.760 --> 2:15:08.520
 I think the right direction looks like people

2:15:08.520 --> 2:15:13.520
 coming back together in a more impactful human way,

2:15:15.040 --> 2:15:20.040
 in person, touching, feeling, talking face to face.

2:15:20.040 --> 2:15:23.160
 So all the things you're describing is what we had,

2:15:23.160 --> 2:15:25.960
 as you mentioned before, when you were like a teenager.

2:15:25.960 --> 2:15:27.080
 So the state of the world.

2:15:27.080 --> 2:15:29.520
 But that's because your mind was formed then.

2:15:29.520 --> 2:15:31.080
 It very well could be.

2:15:31.080 --> 2:15:32.040
 It very well could be.

2:15:32.040 --> 2:15:34.160
 It's very possible that the virtual reality worlds

2:15:34.160 --> 2:15:35.960
 that we'll create will be actually

2:15:35.960 --> 2:15:37.760
 a much higher level of existence.

2:15:37.760 --> 2:15:39.800
 In fact, like now we're getting,

2:15:39.800 --> 2:15:43.280
 we're moving slowly away from tribalism,

2:15:43.280 --> 2:15:46.080
 perhaps you could argue the ideas of nations,

2:15:46.080 --> 2:15:49.760
 and we're going, we're moving into the realm of ideas

2:15:49.760 --> 2:15:51.640
 and it could be a higher form of existence

2:15:51.640 --> 2:15:56.040
 where we're sort of moving past the constraints

2:15:56.040 --> 2:15:59.520
 of our meat vehicles into the space of our minds.

2:15:59.520 --> 2:16:00.720
 It depends what you value.

2:16:00.720 --> 2:16:02.720
 Cause when you sit here and you talk about it,

2:16:02.720 --> 2:16:04.120
 and you're talking about these things

2:16:04.120 --> 2:16:07.240
 in these humongous levels, on these macro levels.

2:16:07.240 --> 2:16:09.080
 And I don't think a lot of people view it that way.

2:16:09.080 --> 2:16:10.400
 I think a lot of people view it as like,

2:16:10.400 --> 2:16:12.640
 what kind of pizza am I getting tonight?

2:16:12.640 --> 2:16:14.760
 Like it's a much different outlook.

2:16:14.760 --> 2:16:19.760
 And sure, the virtual world that's on the horizon,

2:16:19.960 --> 2:16:22.800
 I'm sure it's got benefits and will help people,

2:16:22.800 --> 2:16:25.240
 but is it gonna help the things that you find valuable?

2:16:25.240 --> 2:16:26.760
 Like, was it gonna help commerce?

2:16:26.760 --> 2:16:27.600
 Okay, sure.

2:16:27.600 --> 2:16:29.360
 Is that the thing you find the most valuable?

2:16:29.360 --> 2:16:31.240
 Is it gonna help communication?

2:16:31.240 --> 2:16:33.400
 Well, it'll help disseminating information.

2:16:33.400 --> 2:16:35.280
 Is it gonna help explain the information

2:16:35.280 --> 2:16:36.120
 you're disseminating?

2:16:36.120 --> 2:16:37.280
 Probably not.

2:16:37.280 --> 2:16:39.560
 Is it gonna hinder interpersonal communication?

2:16:39.560 --> 2:16:40.400
 Absolutely.

2:16:40.400 --> 2:16:42.240
 And those are things I find valuable.

2:16:42.240 --> 2:16:44.960
 Interpersonal communication, talking to people.

2:16:44.960 --> 2:16:49.040
 Like it saddens me when I go into a restaurant

2:16:49.040 --> 2:16:50.840
 and there's five year old kids who like,

2:16:50.840 --> 2:16:53.240
 slamming away on an iPad and can't make eye contact

2:16:53.240 --> 2:16:56.280
 with anybody or teenagers who don't say please and thank you

2:16:56.280 --> 2:16:57.400
 when they order from the waitress.

2:16:57.400 --> 2:16:59.440
 Like that to me is wrong.

2:16:59.440 --> 2:17:00.640
 That shit's wrong.

2:17:00.640 --> 2:17:02.480
 And I don't know this for a fact,

2:17:02.480 --> 2:17:06.640
 but I do attribute that to using technology as a crutch

2:17:06.640 --> 2:17:08.440
 when we're raising raising kids.

2:17:08.440 --> 2:17:13.440
 So, you know, I think those are things that I find valuable.

2:17:13.600 --> 2:17:14.600
 I tried to empathize.

2:17:14.600 --> 2:17:16.520
 I mean, I agree with you as a person who grew up

2:17:16.520 --> 2:17:19.880
 in a certain age, but like prior to the internet, I suppose.

2:17:21.040 --> 2:17:25.000
 But, or at least solidified the early philosophies

2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:27.720
 of the way I see the world prior to the internet.

2:17:29.120 --> 2:17:31.360
 During the time of AOL, let's put it this way.

2:17:31.360 --> 2:17:32.200
 Mm hmm.

2:17:32.200 --> 2:17:33.040
 Uh.

2:17:33.040 --> 2:17:33.880
 Brr.

2:17:33.880 --> 2:17:36.680
 Uh, what was your AIMS screen name?

2:17:36.680 --> 2:17:37.520
 I never had one.

2:17:37.520 --> 2:17:38.360
 Okay.

2:17:38.360 --> 2:17:40.840
 I was the last person I knew to get a cell phone.

2:17:40.840 --> 2:17:44.320
 I was so anti all that stuff because I just felt like

2:17:45.280 --> 2:17:46.520
 I didn't want to be a part of it.

2:17:46.520 --> 2:17:47.640
 I did not want to be a part of it.

2:17:47.640 --> 2:17:52.240
 I joined the underground forum about MMA in 2000 or 2001

2:17:52.240 --> 2:17:53.720
 when I first started training.

2:17:54.600 --> 2:17:57.200
 I think right at the tail end, I got a MySpace,

2:17:57.200 --> 2:17:58.360
 but I didn't have any of that stuff

2:17:58.360 --> 2:17:59.760
 and I didn't want any of it.

2:17:59.760 --> 2:18:00.680
 I don't know why.

2:18:00.680 --> 2:18:03.680
 It just was, I was not into it.

2:18:03.680 --> 2:18:06.800
 I felt like, like what are the good things

2:18:06.800 --> 2:18:07.720
 that are going to come out of it?

2:18:07.720 --> 2:18:09.480
 Oh, I'm going to get my package in two days

2:18:09.480 --> 2:18:11.200
 instead of four days?

2:18:11.200 --> 2:18:12.880
 Does that make my life better?

2:18:12.880 --> 2:18:15.240
 I try to, I try to deeply empathize

2:18:15.240 --> 2:18:17.000
 with a lot of experiences of other people.

2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:18.920
 And like one of the things I love,

2:18:18.920 --> 2:18:22.240
 like the smell of paper books and books in general.

2:18:22.240 --> 2:18:24.720
 And early on, this is like five years ago,

2:18:24.720 --> 2:18:27.120
 I just gave away all my books.

2:18:27.120 --> 2:18:30.160
 And I said, you know, I'm really going to try to

2:18:30.160 --> 2:18:33.360
 fall in love with the books in the same way I did before,

2:18:33.360 --> 2:18:36.440
 but now with a Kindle or not a Kindle,

2:18:36.440 --> 2:18:40.400
 like paper, white, whatever, the ebook reader.

2:18:40.400 --> 2:18:42.520
 And I'm still not there,

2:18:42.520 --> 2:18:45.960
 but I've been kind of trying to fall in love

2:18:45.960 --> 2:18:46.840
 with that experience.

2:18:46.840 --> 2:18:48.880
 And the same way I try to think like,

2:18:48.880 --> 2:18:50.760
 teenagers are really into TikTok now,

2:18:50.760 --> 2:18:52.320
 like making these short videos.

2:18:53.240 --> 2:18:56.240
 I try to consider the possibility that their existence

2:18:56.240 --> 2:18:58.480
 will be a much happier one than I've had

2:18:58.480 --> 2:19:01.040
 because of this kind of interaction.

2:19:01.040 --> 2:19:02.920
 From my sort of skeptical perspective,

2:19:02.920 --> 2:19:05.440
 it's like the attention span is so short,

2:19:05.440 --> 2:19:08.880
 they don't really deeply think or deeply experience things.

2:19:08.880 --> 2:19:13.480
 They construct a social layer that they present to the world

2:19:13.480 --> 2:19:15.960
 and they work on creating this social layer,

2:19:15.960 --> 2:19:18.800
 like the presentation to the world much more

2:19:18.800 --> 2:19:20.800
 than really sitting alone with their thoughts

2:19:20.800 --> 2:19:23.560
 and the sadnesses and their hopes and dreams and fears.

2:19:23.560 --> 2:19:28.360
 And like working on the project that is their own,

2:19:28.360 --> 2:19:31.240
 like actual person that exists in this physical world,

2:19:31.240 --> 2:19:32.720
 as opposed to working on the project

2:19:32.720 --> 2:19:35.800
 of a particular social platform that they show.

2:19:35.800 --> 2:19:38.280
 But like, perhaps that project,

2:19:39.120 --> 2:19:42.000
 like who cares who you are in the physical space?

2:19:42.000 --> 2:19:46.000
 Maybe what you are is what your Instagram shows.

2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:48.080
 That's the more important project to work on.

2:19:48.080 --> 2:19:49.200
 Well, what's reality?

2:19:49.200 --> 2:19:50.040
 Yeah, what's reality?

2:19:50.040 --> 2:19:51.240
 Perception is reality, right?

2:19:51.240 --> 2:19:54.720
 So how other people perceive this constructed thing,

2:19:54.720 --> 2:19:56.440
 that's their reality of you.

2:19:56.440 --> 2:19:57.560
 But is it your reality?

2:19:57.560 --> 2:19:59.080
 Like that, I mean, like we said earlier,

2:19:59.080 --> 2:20:03.360
 it's how you want people to see you

2:20:03.360 --> 2:20:06.640
 is very rarely in line with how you really are

2:20:06.640 --> 2:20:08.560
 or how you see yourself.

2:20:08.560 --> 2:20:11.640
 And I mean, I can remember being like a 13 year old kid

2:20:11.640 --> 2:20:13.720
 and like when you go through a bunch of weird

2:20:13.720 --> 2:20:16.800
 13 year old kid shit, like sitting in my room,

2:20:16.800 --> 2:20:18.280
 like turning a red light on

2:20:18.280 --> 2:20:20.280
 and listening to like a sad record

2:20:20.280 --> 2:20:23.320
 and like trying to figure out what's going on inside.

2:20:23.320 --> 2:20:25.400
 Sometimes you like it, sometimes you don't like it.

2:20:25.400 --> 2:20:28.000
 But I feel like those experiences are lost

2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:29.880
 on kids constantly connected to a phone.

2:20:29.880 --> 2:20:32.000
 And like, you know, I don't know what the remedy

2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:33.880
 for those situations is nowadays.

2:20:33.880 --> 2:20:35.480
 Like, I don't know, do they make a TikTok video?

2:20:35.480 --> 2:20:37.200
 Do they blog about it?

2:20:37.200 --> 2:20:39.440
 Do they, you know, make a video or a...

2:20:39.440 --> 2:20:40.760
 Nobody blogs anymore, bro.

2:20:40.760 --> 2:20:41.840
 Whatever, man.

2:20:41.840 --> 2:20:46.000
 Or a video, a story about,

2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:47.400
 oh, this is what happened to me

2:20:47.400 --> 2:20:48.480
 and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2:20:48.480 --> 2:20:50.560
 Does that actually help them work it out?

2:20:50.560 --> 2:20:52.680
 Or does it just create more noise and more static

2:20:52.680 --> 2:20:54.320
 on how to get to the root of the problem

2:20:54.320 --> 2:20:55.800
 and learn about themselves?

2:20:55.800 --> 2:20:58.520
 I don't know what future social networks are exactly.

2:20:58.520 --> 2:21:00.400
 I do know on a shallow level,

2:21:00.400 --> 2:21:03.120
 it does feel good when somebody clicks like on something.

2:21:03.120 --> 2:21:05.080
 I think that is more of a drug

2:21:05.080 --> 2:21:09.040
 than an actual deep long lasting fulfilling happiness.

2:21:09.040 --> 2:21:11.120
 But perhaps there's a way to make a social network

2:21:11.120 --> 2:21:14.200
 that does lead to long lasting happiness

2:21:14.200 --> 2:21:18.240
 that's somehow detached from the physical meat space.

2:21:18.240 --> 2:21:19.920
 I don't know, but it feels like

2:21:19.920 --> 2:21:21.760
 you want to give that a chance.

2:21:21.760 --> 2:21:25.920
 Do you think when people are liking things on social media,

2:21:25.920 --> 2:21:27.800
 do you think there's just a group of people,

2:21:27.800 --> 2:21:29.160
 an overwhelming majority of people

2:21:29.160 --> 2:21:30.920
 that are gonna like whatever you put out there,

2:21:30.920 --> 2:21:32.000
 they're clicking like,

2:21:32.000 --> 2:21:33.480
 and then there's another section of people

2:21:33.480 --> 2:21:35.440
 that just constantly scroll and like,

2:21:35.440 --> 2:21:37.400
 scroll and like, and scroll and like.

2:21:37.400 --> 2:21:41.480
 Like, do you think when you get a like

2:21:41.480 --> 2:21:42.880
 on content you put out,

2:21:42.880 --> 2:21:45.000
 that that like perhaps came from someone

2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:47.200
 who normally doesn't like your content,

2:21:47.200 --> 2:21:50.760
 but like you've just changed their mind on something,

2:21:50.760 --> 2:21:52.720
 you've turned them around on it.

2:21:52.720 --> 2:21:55.320
 I tend to think that when I get likes on social media,

2:21:55.320 --> 2:21:56.840
 those are just the people that like all my shit

2:21:56.840 --> 2:21:57.920
 no matter what I say.

2:21:57.920 --> 2:21:59.120
 Like they probably don't even read it.

2:21:59.120 --> 2:22:02.080
 Like I could put the most preposterous thing up there

2:22:02.080 --> 2:22:03.120
 and you're still gonna get a handful

2:22:03.120 --> 2:22:04.280
 of the same exact likes.

2:22:04.280 --> 2:22:05.120
 That's interesting.

2:22:05.120 --> 2:22:07.800
 But I tend to, the way I see likes,

2:22:07.800 --> 2:22:10.000
 you're kind of, you said multiple things.

2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:13.600
 I think in one sense you see social media

2:22:13.600 --> 2:22:15.640
 as like a battleground of ideas

2:22:15.640 --> 2:22:17.480
 and like is a kind of indicated,

2:22:17.480 --> 2:22:19.520
 like the best possible like is an indicator

2:22:19.520 --> 2:22:24.520
 of like, of you winning over somebody on an idea

2:22:25.040 --> 2:22:26.320
 and they really appreciate that idea.

2:22:26.320 --> 2:22:27.760
 That's the best possible like.

2:22:27.760 --> 2:22:31.720
 To me, a like is just two strangers smiling at each other.

2:22:31.720 --> 2:22:34.400
 Like a moment of like, like.

2:22:35.440 --> 2:22:36.280
 I got you, bro.

2:22:36.280 --> 2:22:37.280
 Yeah, I got you, bro.

2:22:37.280 --> 2:22:38.120
 Yeah.

2:22:38.120 --> 2:22:39.200
 Yeah, like fist bump.

2:22:39.200 --> 2:22:42.120
 Like, yeah, we're in this fucking thing together.

2:22:42.120 --> 2:22:43.600
 This whole thing doesn't make any sense,

2:22:43.600 --> 2:22:44.800
 but we're in this together.

2:22:44.800 --> 2:22:48.600
 And yeah, it's possible for likes to be that.

2:22:48.600 --> 2:22:51.840
 I don't think the actual clicking of a like,

2:22:51.840 --> 2:22:54.560
 I think social media at its best might be that

2:22:54.560 --> 2:22:56.840
 where it's like, I got you, bro.

2:22:56.840 --> 2:23:00.920
 And it's a large scale as opposed to kind of

2:23:02.040 --> 2:23:06.080
 this weird, like crazy pool of dopamine

2:23:06.080 --> 2:23:08.960
 where everyone's just obsessed with this likes and likes

2:23:08.960 --> 2:23:12.680
 and then the division drives like more

2:23:12.680 --> 2:23:16.200
 of this like weird, anxious engagement.

2:23:16.200 --> 2:23:18.200
 I think that's just the dark version of it

2:23:18.200 --> 2:23:19.840
 in the early days of social media.

2:23:19.840 --> 2:23:22.720
 I think you called it a battleground of ideas,

2:23:22.720 --> 2:23:24.880
 but I think social media is nothing but a battleground

2:23:24.880 --> 2:23:26.080
 of fragile egos.

2:23:27.080 --> 2:23:29.880
 Well, but humans are fragile egos.

2:23:29.880 --> 2:23:33.200
 I mean, maybe, but I think the people,

2:23:33.200 --> 2:23:35.200
 I think particularly on social media,

2:23:35.200 --> 2:23:37.360
 they're the most fragile.

2:23:37.360 --> 2:23:41.680
 Like, would you be doing all the things you're doing?

2:23:41.680 --> 2:23:43.640
 What would you be doing if you weren't,

2:23:43.640 --> 2:23:48.640
 if you weren't podcasting and posting the things you do

2:23:50.120 --> 2:23:52.520
 on social media, what would you be doing?

2:23:52.520 --> 2:23:55.720
 You'd probably be much the same guy, right?

2:23:55.720 --> 2:23:57.800
 But I think that on social media,

2:23:57.800 --> 2:24:01.080
 the fragile ego people, what you see on social media

2:24:01.080 --> 2:24:03.600
 is not what they'd be doing without social media.

2:24:03.600 --> 2:24:04.440
 Does that make any sense?

2:24:04.440 --> 2:24:06.200
 Like you're probably,

2:24:06.200 --> 2:24:09.480
 your mission is probably somewhat congruent, your path.

2:24:09.480 --> 2:24:10.960
 You're just utilizing social media.

2:24:10.960 --> 2:24:12.600
 But I think a lot of people,

2:24:12.600 --> 2:24:14.520
 social media has changed their path

2:24:14.520 --> 2:24:19.520
 and now they're doing something totally foreign to them.

2:24:20.080 --> 2:24:22.440
 And they're only able to do it maybe

2:24:22.440 --> 2:24:23.520
 because of social media.

2:24:23.520 --> 2:24:27.160
 I think you're focusing on a particular moment in time

2:24:27.160 --> 2:24:31.560
 of people in their less great moments,

2:24:31.560 --> 2:24:34.120
 like in their less great version of themselves.

2:24:34.120 --> 2:24:37.080
 I think you're just focusing on the masses struggling

2:24:37.080 --> 2:24:39.880
 to become the best version of themselves.

2:24:39.880 --> 2:24:41.920
 And then you, yeah, sure.

2:24:41.920 --> 2:24:45.640
 For stretches of time, whether it's days, weeks, and months,

2:24:45.640 --> 2:24:47.640
 you could be a shady person on the internet.

2:24:47.640 --> 2:24:51.520
 I think you're focusing on that.

2:24:51.520 --> 2:24:56.200
 And unfortunately, social media platforms emphasize

2:24:56.200 --> 2:24:58.200
 they love it when you're like that,

2:24:58.200 --> 2:25:01.360
 when you're not doing great in your own life

2:25:01.360 --> 2:25:04.960
 because it increases anxiety, increases engagement,

2:25:04.960 --> 2:25:07.320
 makes you more susceptible to an argument,

2:25:07.320 --> 2:25:09.640
 and then really get pulled into like conspiracy theories,

2:25:09.640 --> 2:25:11.320
 all that kind of stuff.

2:25:11.320 --> 2:25:12.640
 But the other side works too.

2:25:12.640 --> 2:25:15.360
 I think there's also the people who are on social media

2:25:15.360 --> 2:25:17.520
 fronting like they're these positive figures

2:25:17.520 --> 2:25:21.440
 and going to the gym, whatever it is,

2:25:21.440 --> 2:25:23.280
 the positivity that they spew out.

2:25:23.280 --> 2:25:24.960
 But in real life, they're the most negative fucks

2:25:24.960 --> 2:25:26.040
 you've ever met in your life.

2:25:26.040 --> 2:25:27.600
 And they're just so full of crap.

2:25:27.600 --> 2:25:30.220
 And it's just people playing to an audience.

2:25:30.220 --> 2:25:34.000
 It's like you said, it's like a politician sometimes.

2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:35.840
 A politician wakes up one day and they decide,

2:25:35.840 --> 2:25:38.280
 who's the group I can pander to the best

2:25:38.280 --> 2:25:40.600
 to get the most likes equals votes?

2:25:40.600 --> 2:25:42.080
 And it's the same thing on social media.

2:25:42.080 --> 2:25:45.120
 People wake up and whether it's conscious or not,

2:25:45.120 --> 2:25:47.560
 what's the group I can pander to the best

2:25:47.560 --> 2:25:48.720
 to get the most likes?

2:25:48.720 --> 2:25:50.840
 Is it the positivity motivated crowd?

2:25:50.840 --> 2:25:52.440
 Is it the woe is me crowd?

2:25:52.440 --> 2:25:53.280
 Like what is it?

2:25:53.280 --> 2:25:54.760
 Who's gonna give me the most likes?

2:25:54.760 --> 2:25:55.840
 That's what I'll do.

2:25:57.200 --> 2:25:58.640
 I don't know how to argue against that.

2:25:58.640 --> 2:26:03.600
 I guess it rings true what you're saying,

2:26:03.600 --> 2:26:05.520
 but I just kind of refuse to believe it.

2:26:05.520 --> 2:26:08.560
 I guess I'm pandering to the optimistic crowd.

2:26:08.560 --> 2:26:10.600
 Like I met with my marketing team

2:26:10.600 --> 2:26:15.600
 and I just feel that love has the best,

2:26:16.780 --> 2:26:17.620
 what do you call it?

2:26:17.620 --> 2:26:18.440
 No, I don't know.

2:26:18.440 --> 2:26:19.560
 There's a lot of people that accuse me

2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:21.160
 of being like exactly that,

2:26:21.160 --> 2:26:22.840
 which is like, why are you always being positive?

2:26:22.840 --> 2:26:26.640
 It's like, well, cause I'd like to be that.

2:26:26.640 --> 2:26:30.120
 Yeah, but I wouldn't consider you someone who panders.

2:26:30.120 --> 2:26:33.320
 No, but I guess what I'm saying is like,

2:26:33.320 --> 2:26:38.320
 it's easy to say that everyone is pandering,

2:26:39.160 --> 2:26:42.480
 but like maybe they're just trying.

2:26:42.480 --> 2:26:44.840
 I do believe that social media platforms

2:26:44.840 --> 2:26:46.200
 could encourage people when they're trying

2:26:46.200 --> 2:26:48.320
 to be the best version of themselves, whatever that is.

2:26:48.320 --> 2:26:50.600
 It could be like Conor McGregor talking shit.

2:26:50.600 --> 2:26:52.160
 It could be just being positive.

2:26:52.160 --> 2:26:55.360
 It could be actually creating cool things in this world,

2:26:55.360 --> 2:26:57.440
 putting out instructional videos for Jiu Jitsu

2:26:57.440 --> 2:26:59.840
 or like inspiring students to competition.

2:26:59.840 --> 2:27:00.680
 I don't know.

2:27:00.680 --> 2:27:03.280
 All those kinds of things, educational content.

2:27:03.280 --> 2:27:05.040
 I think that people are trying.

2:27:05.040 --> 2:27:09.560
 Like I tend to believe that people want to be good.

2:27:09.560 --> 2:27:12.760
 Like they want to be successful

2:27:12.760 --> 2:27:14.300
 in whatever that definition of success is.

2:27:14.300 --> 2:27:15.920
 And they're kind of struggling to do that.

2:27:15.920 --> 2:27:18.320
 And they're just awkward at it at first.

2:27:18.320 --> 2:27:21.160
 And like, it's easy to focus on the awkwardness

2:27:21.160 --> 2:27:24.000
 and the stumbling around as people have that.

2:27:24.000 --> 2:27:25.480
 And they start shitting on each other.

2:27:25.480 --> 2:27:27.340
 It's easy to kind of focus in on that.

2:27:27.340 --> 2:27:30.760
 But I think that's just like people, you know, white belts.

2:27:30.760 --> 2:27:32.000
 There's more white belts in the world

2:27:32.000 --> 2:27:32.880
 than there are black belts.

2:27:32.880 --> 2:27:34.920
 But you gotta give them a chance to kind of grow.

2:27:34.920 --> 2:27:37.080
 I think on social media, if you put your stuff out there,

2:27:37.080 --> 2:27:39.000
 whatever your stuff is, your content, your views

2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:41.780
 or whatever, you let the chips fall where they may.

2:27:41.780 --> 2:27:43.960
 Like that's a different thing than being like,

2:27:43.960 --> 2:27:46.880
 I'm gonna tweak what I normally might say

2:27:46.880 --> 2:27:47.720
 and put it up this way

2:27:47.720 --> 2:27:50.280
 because I want these people to like it.

2:27:50.280 --> 2:27:54.360
 And in terms, I also think I have a different viewpoint

2:27:54.360 --> 2:27:56.760
 than you do on people wanting to be successful.

2:27:56.760 --> 2:27:58.280
 I actually don't think that many people

2:27:58.280 --> 2:27:59.840
 want to be successful.

2:27:59.840 --> 2:28:02.100
 I think people want to have the appearance

2:28:02.100 --> 2:28:04.000
 of wanting to be successful.

2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:06.600
 But to be successful takes a shitload of work.

2:28:06.600 --> 2:28:08.560
 And most people don't want to put that work in.

2:28:08.560 --> 2:28:11.000
 So they craft this persona of a person

2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:13.680
 who's trying really hard, but just can't catch the break

2:28:13.680 --> 2:28:15.880
 or, you know, these motherfuckers

2:28:15.880 --> 2:28:18.360
 with getting back on my grind.

2:28:18.360 --> 2:28:19.680
 You've never been on a grind.

2:28:19.680 --> 2:28:20.920
 You've been on the couch.

2:28:20.920 --> 2:28:22.080
 I so disagree with you.

2:28:22.080 --> 2:28:23.000
 I get it.

2:28:23.000 --> 2:28:24.360
 I get it.

2:28:24.360 --> 2:28:25.240
 That's your foil.

2:28:25.240 --> 2:28:27.640
 You enjoyed that guy on the couch with the cheetah.

2:28:27.640 --> 2:28:29.840
 That's your motivation.

2:28:29.840 --> 2:28:30.680
 But just own it.

2:28:30.680 --> 2:28:33.960
 Don't be like back on the ground, back on the couch.

2:28:33.960 --> 2:28:34.800
 Yeah.

2:28:34.800 --> 2:28:36.720
 Well, you're like David Goggins,

2:28:36.720 --> 2:28:38.200
 who was like talking shit to the one guy

2:28:38.200 --> 2:28:39.160
 with the eating Cheetos.

2:28:39.160 --> 2:28:42.260
 And so doing inspires millions

2:28:42.260 --> 2:28:44.660
 to actually pursue their success.

2:28:44.660 --> 2:28:45.500
 I get it.

2:28:45.500 --> 2:28:46.560
 But I just think that most people

2:28:46.560 --> 2:28:48.880
 really do want to be successful

2:28:48.880 --> 2:28:53.000
 and are trying to work hard and they keep failing.

2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:54.120
 So, I mean.

2:28:54.120 --> 2:28:55.920
 But why is it continue?

2:28:55.920 --> 2:28:57.040
 I'm sorry to interrupt you.

2:28:57.040 --> 2:28:59.320
 But like, let's take a person who's overweight.

2:28:59.320 --> 2:29:01.440
 Do you not think that person wants to be skinny?

2:29:01.440 --> 2:29:02.960
 Of course they want to be skinny.

2:29:02.960 --> 2:29:04.800
 They just don't want it enough

2:29:04.800 --> 2:29:07.680
 to put the pizza or the pie down and go to the gym.

2:29:07.680 --> 2:29:10.180
 They want it, but they want it to be easy.

2:29:10.180 --> 2:29:11.720
 Of course they want to be skinny.

2:29:11.720 --> 2:29:13.120
 Well, everyone wants it to be easy.

2:29:13.120 --> 2:29:13.960
 Right.

2:29:13.960 --> 2:29:16.120
 And of course people want to be successful,

2:29:16.120 --> 2:29:18.640
 but do they want it enough to do the work?

2:29:18.640 --> 2:29:19.960
 I don't think they do.

2:29:19.960 --> 2:29:22.920
 I think the easy thing to do is to create

2:29:24.320 --> 2:29:28.800
 an outward facing persona of the person who really wants it.

2:29:28.800 --> 2:29:32.840
 And you get the same reward from a lot of people

2:29:32.840 --> 2:29:35.200
 as the person who actually is successful.

2:29:35.200 --> 2:29:36.720
 Very few people differentiate

2:29:36.720 --> 2:29:38.480
 from the person who's found success

2:29:38.480 --> 2:29:40.480
 and the person who's showing you

2:29:40.480 --> 2:29:43.120
 how they're trying to get success on social media.

2:29:43.120 --> 2:29:44.960
 People see that as the same.

2:29:44.960 --> 2:29:47.800
 I see you're going after the marketing dollar

2:29:47.800 --> 2:29:50.480
 that represents the people that want to work hard.

2:29:50.480 --> 2:29:51.800
 Yeah.

2:29:51.800 --> 2:29:52.640
 I like it.

2:29:54.160 --> 2:29:57.680
 You started a podcast recently.

2:29:57.680 --> 2:29:58.520
 Hell yeah.

2:29:58.520 --> 2:30:02.480
 It's called, which people probably from this conversation

2:30:02.480 --> 2:30:05.120
 can, I guess we didn't really talk about politics much

2:30:05.120 --> 2:30:06.480
 or the fact that you're a business owner

2:30:06.480 --> 2:30:08.960
 or the fact that you're a red blooded American

2:30:08.960 --> 2:30:12.680
 and love this country, America.

2:30:12.680 --> 2:30:14.060
 We didn't really talk about that,

2:30:14.060 --> 2:30:15.640
 but from the name of the podcast,

2:30:15.640 --> 2:30:16.760
 they can probably infer it.

2:30:16.760 --> 2:30:20.580
 And the name is Please Allow Me.

2:30:20.580 --> 2:30:21.420
 Good name.

2:30:24.220 --> 2:30:27.660
 What have you learned from doing this podcast?

2:30:27.660 --> 2:30:30.440
 What's your hope of doing this podcast?

2:30:30.440 --> 2:30:31.680
 People should definitely listen to it.

2:30:31.680 --> 2:30:32.920
 You have a few episodes out.

2:30:32.920 --> 2:30:36.360
 You're damn good at it, which is very interesting.

2:30:36.360 --> 2:30:38.840
 I'm sure you'll evolve and change.

2:30:38.840 --> 2:30:40.160
 So this is like the early days.

2:30:40.160 --> 2:30:41.920
 I'm curious to see where it goes,

2:30:41.920 --> 2:30:44.760
 but what's your thinking around it

2:30:44.760 --> 2:30:48.880
 as an intellectual putting your thoughts out into the world?

2:30:48.880 --> 2:30:52.360
 I think that one of the things that COVID did

2:30:52.360 --> 2:30:56.120
 when we're all kind of in lockdown was as a business owner,

2:30:56.120 --> 2:30:57.880
 made me take stock of what's the future

2:30:57.880 --> 2:30:59.200
 of brick and mortar businesses.

2:30:59.200 --> 2:31:01.920
 And I've always been reluctant

2:31:01.920 --> 2:31:04.500
 to be an online presence in any way,

2:31:04.500 --> 2:31:05.640
 just because it's not my thing,

2:31:05.640 --> 2:31:07.240
 because I believe that I'm a force of nature

2:31:07.240 --> 2:31:10.360
 and people need to experience me, right?

2:31:10.360 --> 2:31:13.600
 And the few characters that Twitter has are phasing.

2:31:13.600 --> 2:31:14.440
 It's not enough to experience.

2:31:14.440 --> 2:31:15.280
 It's not enough.

2:31:15.280 --> 2:31:17.080
 The force of nature, there's John Clark.

2:31:17.080 --> 2:31:19.880
 I want you to feel physically uncomfortable around me.

2:31:19.880 --> 2:31:21.220
 This has been three hours

2:31:21.220 --> 2:31:23.440
 of me being physically uncomfortable.

2:31:23.440 --> 2:31:25.160
 I'm scared for my life.

2:31:25.160 --> 2:31:27.560
 And so I thought that that would be one of the ways

2:31:27.560 --> 2:31:29.200
 in which I could increase.

2:31:29.200 --> 2:31:33.240
 I came to the conclusion that with the lockdown

2:31:33.240 --> 2:31:34.760
 and potential future lockdowns,

2:31:36.200 --> 2:31:39.960
 in order to pay my mortgage and my bar tab

2:31:39.960 --> 2:31:42.240
 and my Grubhub's out of control,

2:31:42.240 --> 2:31:45.480
 that I would need to find ancillary ways to...

2:31:45.480 --> 2:31:47.520
 Door dash slash Lex.

2:31:47.520 --> 2:31:49.820
 You don't want to use Grubhub, Grubhub sucks.

2:31:49.820 --> 2:31:50.660
 Door dash.

2:31:50.660 --> 2:31:51.480
 They actually do.

2:31:51.480 --> 2:31:52.320
 Door dash.

2:31:52.320 --> 2:31:53.140
 No, I'm just kidding.

2:31:53.140 --> 2:31:55.320
 You can go back to your local fooder.

2:31:55.320 --> 2:31:56.160
 711.

2:31:56.160 --> 2:31:57.560
 Yeah, and get the food.

2:31:57.560 --> 2:31:59.600
 You can order 711 from Door Dash.

2:31:59.600 --> 2:32:00.600
 Or from Postmates.

2:32:00.600 --> 2:32:01.540
 Code Lex.

2:32:02.680 --> 2:32:04.520
 Okay, I'm sorry, go.

2:32:04.520 --> 2:32:05.560
 But anyway, I thought it was like,

2:32:05.560 --> 2:32:07.440
 oh, I should probably increase a little bit

2:32:07.440 --> 2:32:12.160
 my online presence and what would be a way to do that

2:32:12.160 --> 2:32:14.960
 that would be fun for me and entertaining.

2:32:14.960 --> 2:32:18.720
 And I thought, well, a lot of people, yourself included,

2:32:18.720 --> 2:32:20.520
 that I know have done some podcasts

2:32:20.520 --> 2:32:24.440
 and I find that inspiring and I'm fortunate enough

2:32:24.440 --> 2:32:25.920
 to know a bunch of cool motherfuckers

2:32:25.920 --> 2:32:30.920
 that I can talk to about a wide range of topics.

2:32:31.160 --> 2:32:32.440
 Then they're starting to drop in.

2:32:32.440 --> 2:32:34.000
 There's an aspect to which podcasting

2:32:34.000 --> 2:32:36.600
 does capture the force of nature better.

2:32:36.600 --> 2:32:39.280
 In the digital form, podcasting captures

2:32:39.280 --> 2:32:40.860
 the force of nature of a human being

2:32:40.860 --> 2:32:42.440
 better than other mediums, perhaps.

2:32:42.440 --> 2:32:43.800
 Yeah, definitely, there's that.

2:32:43.800 --> 2:32:48.560
 I just felt like, you know when it's midnight

2:32:48.560 --> 2:32:51.720
 and you're in the bar and you get the sense

2:32:51.720 --> 2:32:53.760
 that the bar's gonna close in 90 minutes

2:32:53.760 --> 2:32:57.000
 and you think, you know, not enough people have seen me yet

2:32:57.000 --> 2:32:58.220
 and maybe we should go to another bar

2:32:58.220 --> 2:33:00.040
 so more people can see me.

2:33:00.040 --> 2:33:03.720
 I feel like podcasting is like that for me.

2:33:03.720 --> 2:33:05.680
 Not enough people have heard my thoughts

2:33:05.680 --> 2:33:08.800
 and I feel like, my mom raised me to be a giver.

2:33:08.800 --> 2:33:10.800
 She didn't want me to be selfish.

2:33:10.800 --> 2:33:15.120
 And I have these thoughts that I think.

2:33:15.120 --> 2:33:17.000
 It'd be a waste if you didn't give it to the world.

2:33:17.000 --> 2:33:18.600
 People seem to really enjoy them.

2:33:18.600 --> 2:33:20.760
 Yeah, no, I enjoy them.

2:33:20.760 --> 2:33:23.360
 While I've probably been on my best behavior today

2:33:23.360 --> 2:33:25.720
 on this episode of the podcast.

2:33:25.720 --> 2:33:29.840
 So if you want the uncensored, unfiltered,

2:33:29.840 --> 2:33:31.920
 the full spectrum of the force of nature,

2:33:31.920 --> 2:33:35.680
 there's John Clark, you go to the podcast.

2:33:35.680 --> 2:33:37.960
 Funny enough, I think you're drinking

2:33:37.960 --> 2:33:39.440
 throughout most of the podcast.

2:33:39.440 --> 2:33:40.440
 Yeah, yeah.

2:33:40.440 --> 2:33:42.960
 Tequila, so they only last like an hour

2:33:42.960 --> 2:33:45.040
 because you seem to like, I'm guessing

2:33:45.040 --> 2:33:47.160
 that you just lose it one hour.

2:33:47.160 --> 2:33:50.360
 Like it's like Cinderella turns into a frog or whatever.

2:33:50.360 --> 2:33:52.640
 One of the things I'm learning is

2:33:54.880 --> 2:33:57.680
 sometimes you have great conversations when you're drunk

2:33:57.680 --> 2:33:58.600
 and sometimes you don't.

2:33:58.600 --> 2:34:01.240
 Like I went into it with the write drunk,

2:34:01.240 --> 2:34:02.620
 edit sober mentality.

2:34:03.760 --> 2:34:05.120
 Yes, Hemingway.

2:34:05.120 --> 2:34:06.360
 Hemingway, yes.

2:34:06.360 --> 2:34:10.800
 But turns out that sometimes you don't have that much

2:34:10.800 --> 2:34:13.120
 to edit when you're super shit faced.

2:34:13.120 --> 2:34:17.120
 And so I've been scaling that back a little bit.

2:34:17.120 --> 2:34:18.440
 What do you mean exactly by that?

2:34:18.440 --> 2:34:20.440
 Like, where does it go wrong when you're drunk?

2:34:20.440 --> 2:34:22.840
 I'm curious about that, because.

2:34:22.840 --> 2:34:26.180
 It gets, especially when you have a personal relationship

2:34:26.180 --> 2:34:27.780
 with the person that you're talking to,

2:34:27.780 --> 2:34:29.860
 rather than trying to put some ideas on display

2:34:29.860 --> 2:34:32.000
 for other people to hear and maybe talk about,

2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:33.760
 you wind up just having like a conversation

2:34:33.760 --> 2:34:36.040
 with your bro about inside jokes and things like that.

2:34:36.040 --> 2:34:37.760
 And it's like, it's not that interesting.

2:34:37.760 --> 2:34:40.240
 No one wants to like watch, you know,

2:34:40.240 --> 2:34:42.360
 go to a bar and watch two people at the,

2:34:42.360 --> 2:34:44.360
 sitting there getting drunk and talking to each other

2:34:44.360 --> 2:34:48.480
 is different than listening to like strong discourse.

2:34:48.480 --> 2:34:49.320
 Yes.

2:34:49.320 --> 2:34:51.440
 One interesting thing as a fan of Joe Rogan,

2:34:51.440 --> 2:34:53.520
 I'm a fan, I've been a fan of Joe Rogan for a long time

2:34:53.520 --> 2:34:56.200
 and he has his friends over a lot, right?

2:34:56.200 --> 2:34:59.000
 And there's a aspect to those three, four,

2:34:59.000 --> 2:35:00.760
 five hour conversations that I really enjoy.

2:35:00.760 --> 2:35:02.360
 There's a magic to those.

2:35:02.360 --> 2:35:03.880
 I think he taught the world that those kinds

2:35:03.880 --> 2:35:06.240
 of long form conversations can work.

2:35:06.240 --> 2:35:10.640
 The, what you forget is Joe Rogan is a comedian.

2:35:10.640 --> 2:35:12.400
 His friends are also celebrities.

2:35:12.400 --> 2:35:14.800
 Like they know what it's like to be on the mic.

2:35:14.800 --> 2:35:17.280
 They know there is a challenge

2:35:17.280 --> 2:35:20.240
 to actually having your friends on a microphone.

2:35:20.240 --> 2:35:21.080
 Totally.

2:35:21.080 --> 2:35:22.040
 Like they've never,

2:35:22.040 --> 2:35:24.040
 this is the first time they've been on a microphone.

2:35:24.040 --> 2:35:25.520
 And that's actually what you've been doing,

2:35:25.520 --> 2:35:28.000
 which is a very interesting experiment.

2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:31.880
 And you find that some are more awkward than others.

2:35:31.880 --> 2:35:33.520
 Like they're trying to find like,

2:35:33.520 --> 2:35:35.180
 what do I do with this kind of thing?

2:35:35.180 --> 2:35:37.720
 Why do you not talk to strangers?

2:35:37.720 --> 2:35:41.480
 Why did you go with people that you're actually know?

2:35:41.480 --> 2:35:43.160
 So the simple answer is the people

2:35:43.160 --> 2:35:44.880
 that I selected are both interesting

2:35:44.880 --> 2:35:46.640
 and I thought would be good at talking.

2:35:46.640 --> 2:35:48.760
 But then I noticed the thing you just mentioned.

2:35:48.760 --> 2:35:51.560
 My buddy Paul did the first one and Paul's a wild man.

2:35:51.560 --> 2:35:52.880
 And if you went out with Paul,

2:35:52.880 --> 2:35:56.040
 he can talk about a bazillion topics

2:35:56.040 --> 2:36:00.200
 to a certain, to a significant level of depth, right?

2:36:00.200 --> 2:36:01.200
 And he's got a good understanding

2:36:01.200 --> 2:36:03.800
 and he's got a unique perspective on a lot of things.

2:36:03.800 --> 2:36:08.800
 And I think he was the first guy invited on my podcast

2:36:10.920 --> 2:36:15.200
 and it was almost like he was on a little bit

2:36:15.200 --> 2:36:16.880
 less than natural about it.

2:36:16.880 --> 2:36:19.120
 And then by the time he loosened up with some drinks,

2:36:19.120 --> 2:36:22.520
 he was, it just, we were all shitfaced.

2:36:22.520 --> 2:36:24.080
 There's a face shift though.

2:36:24.080 --> 2:36:25.440
 Totally, totally.

2:36:25.440 --> 2:36:27.760
 And so he's gonna come back on

2:36:27.760 --> 2:36:29.240
 and he'll be more comfortable with it.

2:36:29.240 --> 2:36:31.000
 And it'll probably be awesome

2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:33.480
 because he's a great person to talk to.

2:36:33.480 --> 2:36:35.400
 I had my friend Dave on who's a restaurateur

2:36:35.400 --> 2:36:39.280
 and a musician, that one will be released pretty soon.

2:36:39.280 --> 2:36:40.760
 But yesterday I had a guy on

2:36:40.760 --> 2:36:42.440
 who you might really enjoy listening to

2:36:42.440 --> 2:36:44.640
 who's a friend of mine, his name's Mark Clem.

2:36:44.640 --> 2:36:48.480
 He's an endurance athlete and he's been compared,

2:36:48.480 --> 2:36:51.080
 he's been called the white Dave Goggins.

2:36:51.080 --> 2:36:53.880
 And he talks about like those comparisons

2:36:53.880 --> 2:36:56.960
 and what he hates about it and the various events and stuff.

2:36:56.960 --> 2:36:59.520
 And he's just a guy who's just always kind of like natural

2:36:59.520 --> 2:37:01.880
 and like, I knew he'd be great to get on the podcast.

2:37:01.880 --> 2:37:06.880
 And so I started with friends who I thought could handle it

2:37:07.480 --> 2:37:10.480
 and who also are just really interesting people.

2:37:10.480 --> 2:37:13.960
 And I did it so that I could also establish

2:37:13.960 --> 2:37:16.520
 a level of comfort because it was a new thing for me.

2:37:16.520 --> 2:37:18.240
 And I knew that they wouldn't really give a shit

2:37:18.240 --> 2:37:20.080
 what I was doing and be like, hey, this is cool.

2:37:20.080 --> 2:37:21.120
 I'm going over to JC's house.

2:37:21.120 --> 2:37:22.680
 We're gonna drink some tequila and talk shit.

2:37:22.680 --> 2:37:24.640
 There's just gonna be a microphone there this time.

2:37:24.640 --> 2:37:26.480
 I mean, it's amazing what you're doing, the freedom of it.

2:37:26.480 --> 2:37:28.560
 I mean, you're not currently doing any advertisements

2:37:28.560 --> 2:37:29.440
 or any of that kind of stuff.

2:37:29.440 --> 2:37:30.480
 You're just exploring your voice.

2:37:30.480 --> 2:37:32.920
 This is one of the mediums that you're just trying it out.

2:37:32.920 --> 2:37:34.800
 My 11 subscribers know what I'm about.

2:37:34.800 --> 2:37:38.040
 Your 11 subscribers, it's in the double digits.

2:37:40.320 --> 2:37:43.520
 For both you and I, do you have advice for me

2:37:43.520 --> 2:37:46.600
 as a podcaster and for yourself as a podcast?

2:37:46.600 --> 2:37:49.480
 Like if you were to think like you're gonna do say,

2:37:49.480 --> 2:37:53.560
 I mean, who knows, but say you do a thousand more episodes.

2:37:53.560 --> 2:37:58.180
 Like imagine a world where your life continues

2:37:58.180 --> 2:38:01.160
 in that direction, that this is like a little parallel.

2:38:01.160 --> 2:38:03.440
 Like for me, this thing is like a little side hobby,

2:38:03.440 --> 2:38:06.080
 but it's also one that's deeply fulfilling.

2:38:07.100 --> 2:38:09.080
 So not just from a business perspective,

2:38:09.080 --> 2:38:10.480
 which is not the way I think about it.

2:38:10.480 --> 2:38:13.000
 I just think from a life human perspective,

2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:16.200
 it's I probably wouldn't have this kind of conversation

2:38:16.200 --> 2:38:20.900
 with you off mic, like this long, this deep, this attentive.

2:38:20.900 --> 2:38:22.300
 There's something really fulfilling

2:38:22.300 --> 2:38:23.640
 about these conversations.

2:38:23.640 --> 2:38:26.380
 So what advice would you have for me?

2:38:26.380 --> 2:38:28.040
 What advice do you have for yourself?

2:38:28.040 --> 2:38:31.000
 Oh, have you not introspected this that deeply?

2:38:31.000 --> 2:38:32.480
 Oh, I have advice.

2:38:32.480 --> 2:38:34.320
 I think the first advice I would give to you

2:38:34.320 --> 2:38:37.160
 is I think you should have me on more often.

2:38:37.160 --> 2:38:38.000
 Yeah.

2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:39.760
 Yeah.

2:38:39.760 --> 2:38:41.120
 That's first and foremost.

2:38:41.120 --> 2:38:43.920
 And second is go on your podcast and have a conversation.

2:38:43.920 --> 2:38:48.920
 Well, I would say you come on my podcast when you're ready.

2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:49.840
 Yeah.

2:38:49.840 --> 2:38:52.920
 When you feel like the product that I'm putting out

2:38:54.040 --> 2:38:57.000
 would benefit from your presence and vice versa,

2:38:57.000 --> 2:39:01.680
 not as a favor to a bro, but at the right time.

2:39:01.680 --> 2:39:04.160
 I do sense, actually, it's an interesting,

2:39:04.160 --> 2:39:07.800
 there's a dance to it, which is like Joe Rogan,

2:39:07.800 --> 2:39:12.120
 I recently did, like Joe Rogan had a conversation with me

2:39:12.120 --> 2:39:13.740
 on this podcast.

2:39:13.740 --> 2:39:16.080
 There's a very specific kind of thing

2:39:16.080 --> 2:39:19.560
 where you're helping each other out.

2:39:19.560 --> 2:39:20.400
 Yeah.

2:39:20.400 --> 2:39:22.300
 But the timing on that has to be right.

2:39:22.300 --> 2:39:23.140
 Right.

2:39:23.140 --> 2:39:24.880
 You know, like if that makes any sense,

2:39:24.880 --> 2:39:26.480
 you're like supporting each other.

2:39:26.480 --> 2:39:27.640
 It doesn't make sense.

2:39:27.640 --> 2:39:30.680
 It doesn't make a difference, you would think.

2:39:30.680 --> 2:39:31.520
 Right.

2:39:31.520 --> 2:39:32.760
 Because it's just people talking,

2:39:32.760 --> 2:39:34.160
 it doesn't matter what microphones,

2:39:34.160 --> 2:39:35.300
 but it changes things.

2:39:35.300 --> 2:39:36.900
 It does, and there's an order to the guests

2:39:36.900 --> 2:39:38.120
 that I've had on.

2:39:38.120 --> 2:39:39.700
 And the next guest that I'll have on

2:39:39.700 --> 2:39:42.640
 will be a friend we have in common,

2:39:42.640 --> 2:39:44.200
 and we'll be talking about teaching

2:39:44.200 --> 2:39:45.960
 and how to teach different styles of teaching

2:39:45.960 --> 2:39:47.520
 and what you're teaching and all these other things.

2:39:47.520 --> 2:39:48.640
 Your mind's saying who?

2:39:48.640 --> 2:39:49.840
 Oh, Sean Fisher.

2:39:49.840 --> 2:39:53.120
 And I think there's an order to,

2:39:53.120 --> 2:39:56.760
 it's not scientific, but it's based on my gut.

2:39:56.760 --> 2:39:58.920
 Is it astrologically based?

2:40:00.720 --> 2:40:02.520
 What do you mean it's not scientific?

2:40:02.520 --> 2:40:05.440
 Your gut, so you have a sense,

2:40:05.440 --> 2:40:09.560
 like Joe Rogan, for example, tries to do left, right.

2:40:09.560 --> 2:40:12.440
 He tries to alternate like this gut feeling

2:40:12.440 --> 2:40:14.480
 of like these bins of people,

2:40:14.480 --> 2:40:17.440
 and he tries to alternate worldviews.

2:40:17.440 --> 2:40:18.280
 That's interesting.

2:40:18.280 --> 2:40:21.120
 Like he kind of, so that he doesn't feel like it,

2:40:21.120 --> 2:40:25.040
 like it constantly shakes him.

2:40:25.040 --> 2:40:26.400
 It's more about him,

2:40:26.400 --> 2:40:28.800
 like constantly pulls him in multiple directions

2:40:28.800 --> 2:40:31.240
 about like how he sees the world,

2:40:31.240 --> 2:40:32.760
 and that keeps him balanced.

2:40:32.760 --> 2:40:34.600
 That keeps the conversation kind of exciting.

2:40:34.600 --> 2:40:35.440
 That's interesting.

2:40:35.440 --> 2:40:39.240
 I did it in a way where I knew Paul was gonna be wild

2:40:39.240 --> 2:40:40.640
 and we might get a little out of control

2:40:40.640 --> 2:40:43.640
 and like have some technical hiccups along the way.

2:40:43.640 --> 2:40:44.600
 And then my friend Jake,

2:40:44.600 --> 2:40:47.020
 who's a CEO of a pharmaceutical company,

2:40:47.020 --> 2:40:49.360
 that was very timely because he was able

2:40:49.360 --> 2:40:50.720
 to speak to vaccines.

2:40:50.720 --> 2:40:52.600
 And that was kind of scientific flavored.

2:40:52.600 --> 2:40:53.440
 Yeah.

2:40:53.440 --> 2:40:55.600
 And what I learned listening back on that

2:40:55.600 --> 2:40:57.960
 is like I learned for myself about,

2:40:58.920 --> 2:41:02.120
 I wasn't asking the next level questions

2:41:02.120 --> 2:41:04.320
 to really draw out great answers.

2:41:04.320 --> 2:41:09.320
 And part of it is you're simultaneously hanging out

2:41:09.360 --> 2:41:11.240
 with a bro, but also I was trying to learn something

2:41:11.240 --> 2:41:12.920
 and I didn't learn what I wanted to learn.

2:41:12.920 --> 2:41:15.600
 And that's my fault because I didn't ask the questions.

2:41:15.600 --> 2:41:17.280
 He's an expert in that field.

2:41:17.280 --> 2:41:19.680
 He doesn't know that I'm an absolute dipshit

2:41:19.680 --> 2:41:20.920
 when it comes to that stuff.

2:41:20.920 --> 2:41:22.040
 And so I didn't do a good job.

2:41:22.040 --> 2:41:22.880
 And if I don't know it,

2:41:22.880 --> 2:41:25.040
 that means the thing I was trying to tease out of him,

2:41:25.040 --> 2:41:27.960
 no one who was gonna listen is gonna learn that either.

2:41:27.960 --> 2:41:28.960
 So I learned that.

2:41:30.400 --> 2:41:31.800
 Then I had the one with soap on,

2:41:31.800 --> 2:41:34.800
 which I thought was pretty good.

2:41:34.800 --> 2:41:36.880
 He's a wrestler, he's also a farmer.

2:41:36.880 --> 2:41:38.600
 Right, and a social worker.

2:41:38.600 --> 2:41:40.720
 And kind of humble and thoughtful.

2:41:40.720 --> 2:41:41.560
 Yeah, thoughtful.

2:41:41.560 --> 2:41:42.480
 Thoughtful guy.

2:41:42.480 --> 2:41:45.160
 Like slower, he's not a wild man, that kind of thing.

2:41:45.160 --> 2:41:46.960
 Not a wild man in the sense that I'm wild,

2:41:46.960 --> 2:41:51.080
 but he does preach this philosophy of being more wild.

2:41:51.080 --> 2:41:52.960
 Like being in touch with nature.

2:41:52.960 --> 2:41:54.800
 Nature, that kind of wild.

2:41:54.800 --> 2:41:55.640
 Right, right, right.

2:41:55.640 --> 2:42:00.640
 And then my buddy Dave, he came on because I love music.

2:42:01.640 --> 2:42:03.240
 And I wanted to talk a lot about music.

2:42:03.240 --> 2:42:05.200
 And he's one of the most knowledgeable people

2:42:05.200 --> 2:42:06.400
 about music that I know.

2:42:06.400 --> 2:42:07.600
 And he's got a restaurant coming up.

2:42:07.600 --> 2:42:11.160
 And I thought my buddy Mark Clem,

2:42:11.160 --> 2:42:12.360
 being an endurance athlete,

2:42:12.360 --> 2:42:13.480
 like when you hear some of the things,

2:42:13.480 --> 2:42:14.920
 I didn't even know these things existed

2:42:14.920 --> 2:42:16.240
 that this fucking kid did.

2:42:16.240 --> 2:42:17.760
 He's out of his mind.

2:42:17.760 --> 2:42:19.760
 And I think Sean and I will have

2:42:19.760 --> 2:42:21.760
 probably the most intellectual conversation

2:42:21.760 --> 2:42:24.200
 that I'll have had on my podcast to date.

2:42:24.200 --> 2:42:26.560
 And so there's a little bit of alternating there,

2:42:26.560 --> 2:42:31.560
 but I did it that way so that.

2:42:32.200 --> 2:42:34.760
 There's a gut feeling behind, oh, so that what?

2:42:34.760 --> 2:42:36.600
 Is there, where are you going?

2:42:36.600 --> 2:42:38.040
 Do you know where you're going?

2:42:39.360 --> 2:42:42.160
 I don't have a destination, but I want to,

2:42:42.160 --> 2:42:47.160
 I want to see it to its end, whether that's,

2:42:48.680 --> 2:42:51.600
 it gets somewhere of its own volition

2:42:51.600 --> 2:42:53.760
 or it takes on a new life at some point.

2:42:53.760 --> 2:42:56.360
 And then I know how to drive it where it needs to go.

2:42:57.760 --> 2:43:02.680
 I think the advice I have for both of us is,

2:43:04.920 --> 2:43:09.920
 I think I need to, no, I don't think so.

2:43:09.920 --> 2:43:12.960
 I think for you, I see an inner turmoil.

2:43:12.960 --> 2:43:14.880
 I see a storm that bruising you

2:43:14.880 --> 2:43:17.720
 because I feel like there's a concern

2:43:17.720 --> 2:43:18.880
 for what you're saying.

2:43:18.880 --> 2:43:23.880
 And is it gonna lead to negative feelings towards you

2:43:27.360 --> 2:43:29.400
 or the thing that you're doing?

2:43:29.400 --> 2:43:33.760
 And I feel like we're different people

2:43:33.760 --> 2:43:37.320
 and I have such an easier time saying fuck off to everybody.

2:43:37.320 --> 2:43:40.000
 And that's a liberating thing,

2:43:40.000 --> 2:43:43.440
 but it also can keep me from achieving the thing

2:43:43.440 --> 2:43:44.960
 that I want to achieve,

2:43:44.960 --> 2:43:48.280
 because I'm so flippant with opinions

2:43:48.280 --> 2:43:49.480
 that I don't listen to them

2:43:49.480 --> 2:43:51.120
 and let them direct me when they should.

2:43:51.120 --> 2:43:52.240
 There's a balance.

2:43:53.400 --> 2:43:54.560
 Let me push back on that.

2:43:54.560 --> 2:43:55.400
 Please do.

2:43:55.400 --> 2:43:57.600
 I think you believe that about yourself

2:43:57.600 --> 2:43:59.800
 and nevertheless, your social media presence

2:43:59.800 --> 2:44:01.000
 indicates otherwise.

2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:02.640
 If I were to be very harsh,

2:44:02.640 --> 2:44:05.600
 you're like one of the mentally strongest

2:44:05.600 --> 2:44:07.280
 character wise people I know.

2:44:07.280 --> 2:44:09.000
 And yet on social media,

2:44:09.000 --> 2:44:11.640
 you don't put your face to the world.

2:44:11.640 --> 2:44:15.480
 So one of the reasons you sense the fear in me,

2:44:15.480 --> 2:44:18.800
 which exists, I of course want to let go of it,

2:44:18.800 --> 2:44:23.200
 is because I put my face and my name on things.

2:44:23.200 --> 2:44:26.160
 And so when I say something stupid,

2:44:26.160 --> 2:44:29.760
 it hurts when people say like,

2:44:29.760 --> 2:44:32.040
 look, that guy said something stupid.

2:44:32.040 --> 2:44:34.120
 And so there's a fear of saying something stupid

2:44:34.120 --> 2:44:36.520
 in all of his different forms,

2:44:36.520 --> 2:44:38.280
 like of being my lesser self.

2:44:38.280 --> 2:44:40.040
 It's the same feeling I have in competition

2:44:40.040 --> 2:44:42.520
 of losing, not just losing.

2:44:42.520 --> 2:44:43.480
 Losing doesn't matter.

2:44:43.480 --> 2:44:45.920
 It's embarrassing myself.

2:44:45.920 --> 2:44:48.960
 I like losing, being the lesser version of myself.

2:44:48.960 --> 2:44:50.760
 And when you put yourself out there in a full way,

2:44:50.760 --> 2:44:51.600
 I think you,

2:44:52.560 --> 2:44:54.800
 I would venture to say you're also,

2:44:54.800 --> 2:44:58.240
 because you said you wouldn't give yourself that advice.

2:44:58.240 --> 2:44:59.720
 I feel like you're also afraid

2:44:59.720 --> 2:45:01.520
 of standing behind some of the ideas,

2:45:01.520 --> 2:45:03.320
 because right now you're doing guerrilla warfare.

2:45:03.320 --> 2:45:07.080
 You're free to be,

2:45:07.080 --> 2:45:11.600
 to say things, to speak your mind from the sidelines.

2:45:11.600 --> 2:45:13.360
 But the moment you're standing,

2:45:13.360 --> 2:45:16.120
 and when people can throw shit at you,

2:45:16.120 --> 2:45:19.520
 I feel like you haven't faced that fire yet.

2:45:19.520 --> 2:45:20.840
 You've been avoiding that fire.

2:45:20.840 --> 2:45:22.840
 I'm not sure, maybe I'm projecting.

2:45:22.840 --> 2:45:24.320
 No, to a degree you're right.

2:45:24.320 --> 2:45:27.960
 I think a big thing for me was putting ads on

2:45:27.960 --> 2:45:32.920
 for our Jiu Jitsu online curriculum.

2:45:32.920 --> 2:45:34.840
 That was a big thing for me,

2:45:34.840 --> 2:45:36.960
 because for several reasons,

2:45:36.960 --> 2:45:39.480
 like in the climate of everyone under the sun

2:45:39.480 --> 2:45:44.120
 having a Jiu Jitsu tutorial online and social media,

2:45:44.120 --> 2:45:45.280
 not social media necessarily,

2:45:45.280 --> 2:45:49.520
 but forums specifically that critique and shit the bed.

2:45:49.520 --> 2:45:51.760
 One thing I have not done that I've thought about doing,

2:45:51.760 --> 2:45:54.440
 and probably you're right in your analysis of it,

2:45:54.440 --> 2:45:56.920
 is I've not gone the way that I do see you

2:45:56.920 --> 2:45:58.560
 on things like Reddit and say,

2:45:58.560 --> 2:46:00.200
 hey, Reddit, I'm doing this.

2:46:00.200 --> 2:46:01.720
 Like I could easily go to Reddit and say,

2:46:01.720 --> 2:46:04.440
 hey, Reddit, I got this website up.

2:46:04.440 --> 2:46:05.640
 Here's a sample video,

2:46:05.640 --> 2:46:07.000
 whatever the fuck people do on there.

2:46:07.000 --> 2:46:08.520
 But yeah, you're right, I haven't done that.

2:46:08.520 --> 2:46:13.520
 And part of it might be because I know also,

2:46:15.680 --> 2:46:18.760
 if I get suckered in for one second into the negativity,

2:46:18.760 --> 2:46:20.560
 I'm gonna become an online warrior,

2:46:20.560 --> 2:46:22.400
 and I don't wanna be that person.

2:46:22.400 --> 2:46:23.240
 So yeah, you're probably right.

2:46:23.240 --> 2:46:25.120
 So you're self aware about that.

2:46:25.120 --> 2:46:27.720
 I mean, one of the things I've early on decided

2:46:27.720 --> 2:46:30.920
 is like, I'm just gonna be,

2:46:30.920 --> 2:46:32.920
 I've always really enjoyed being positive.

2:46:32.920 --> 2:46:35.760
 So I'm going to make sure I stay that way.

2:46:35.760 --> 2:46:37.800
 And when there's negativity, it's like,

2:46:38.680 --> 2:46:40.320
 I'm not just ignoring it.

2:46:40.320 --> 2:46:42.840
 I'm literally just returning it with positivity.

2:46:43.960 --> 2:46:45.800
 I probably am the same way as you,

2:46:45.800 --> 2:46:49.040
 most people are with egos.

2:46:49.040 --> 2:46:51.200
 You wanna become the warrior against the negativity.

2:46:51.200 --> 2:46:56.040
 And like many wars, there's no winning.

2:46:56.040 --> 2:46:57.360
 There's no winning that war.

2:46:57.360 --> 2:46:58.200
 Especially online.

2:46:58.200 --> 2:46:59.120
 Especially on the internet.

2:46:59.120 --> 2:47:02.520
 And so in that sense, that's been a journey

2:47:02.520 --> 2:47:07.520
 to try to face the fire of the negativity.

2:47:07.520 --> 2:47:08.760
 And it's not actually that bad.

2:47:08.760 --> 2:47:09.960
 It sounds like very dramatic.

2:47:09.960 --> 2:47:11.600
 There's not many people that are negative,

2:47:11.600 --> 2:47:14.000
 but it's like when you put advertisements,

2:47:14.000 --> 2:47:15.920
 so you put your face on an instructional

2:47:15.920 --> 2:47:17.440
 or something like that.

2:47:17.440 --> 2:47:19.360
 It just, there's an aspect to it

2:47:19.360 --> 2:47:20.720
 which you're being a salesman,

2:47:20.720 --> 2:47:23.400
 you're being a gimmicky thing.

2:47:23.400 --> 2:47:24.960
 It just feels wrong.

2:47:24.960 --> 2:47:26.440
 And people will point out, look,

2:47:26.440 --> 2:47:28.000
 that guy is a fraud, like it's fake.

2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:29.320
 Look, he's trying,

2:47:29.320 --> 2:47:31.200
 but those people are going to be out there.

2:47:31.200 --> 2:47:33.520
 And if you're like trying to do your best,

2:47:33.520 --> 2:47:36.480
 trying to be authentic and not trying to like

2:47:36.480 --> 2:47:40.680
 be a snake oil salesman

2:47:40.680 --> 2:47:43.080
 and being like the shady kind of salesman,

2:47:44.720 --> 2:47:46.320
 I think they keep you honest.

2:47:46.320 --> 2:47:49.160
 They keep you honestly being the most authentic self.

2:47:49.160 --> 2:47:52.360
 And podcasting is like the best medium

2:47:52.360 --> 2:47:53.360
 because you're being real.

2:47:53.360 --> 2:47:56.760
 Those one hour plus that you put out there,

2:47:56.760 --> 2:47:58.680
 that's like real John.

2:47:58.680 --> 2:47:59.560
 That's not a,

2:48:01.520 --> 2:48:04.040
 like people fall in love with that.

2:48:04.040 --> 2:48:06.480
 And that's the beautiful aspect of podcasting

2:48:06.480 --> 2:48:08.160
 is there's no,

2:48:09.040 --> 2:48:12.320
 long form doesn't give any possibility

2:48:12.320 --> 2:48:13.840
 for you not to be authentic.

2:48:14.920 --> 2:48:17.080
 And that's why it's a magical medium.

2:48:17.080 --> 2:48:21.120
 The tough thing is you're not,

2:48:21.120 --> 2:48:25.000
 popularity takes time, not popularity.

2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:27.840
 And so like you shouldn't be doing it for that reason.

2:48:27.840 --> 2:48:29.480
 And I don't,

2:48:29.480 --> 2:48:33.640
 it's not the thing that really drives me.

2:48:33.640 --> 2:48:34.600
 Yeah.

2:48:34.600 --> 2:48:35.880
 Is there three books,

2:48:35.880 --> 2:48:38.440
 technical fiction philosophical that had an impact on you?

2:48:38.440 --> 2:48:40.240
 Like, is there books that you kind of return to

2:48:40.240 --> 2:48:44.840
 that you enjoy and that you find profound in some way?

2:48:44.840 --> 2:48:46.920
 I would say like probably the thing I read

2:48:46.920 --> 2:48:49.160
 is in one of Emerson's essays that I read

2:48:49.160 --> 2:48:52.880
 at a point in my life where I needed that type of thing.

2:48:52.880 --> 2:48:55.320
 And I read self reliance and,

2:48:55.320 --> 2:48:56.440
 he's got a ton of good essays,

2:48:56.440 --> 2:48:58.120
 but I thought self reliance was probably

2:48:58.120 --> 2:48:59.840
 the most impactful to me.

2:49:01.800 --> 2:49:03.120
 I've read later in life,

2:49:03.120 --> 2:49:07.400
 like a handful of existential authors

2:49:07.400 --> 2:49:09.000
 and they're all great,

2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:12.120
 but at the time a lot of it has to do with timing.

2:49:12.120 --> 2:49:14.000
 And when I read self reliance

2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:17.360
 and it was about the individual that was really good

2:49:17.360 --> 2:49:19.800
 and made it was impactful.

2:49:19.800 --> 2:49:22.680
 There's also a book called Jonathan Livingston Seagull

2:49:22.680 --> 2:49:25.240
 by Richard Bach, I think.

2:49:25.240 --> 2:49:27.840
 And it's kind of along the same lines.

2:49:27.840 --> 2:49:30.960
 It's about this seagull who wants to break conformity

2:49:30.960 --> 2:49:33.520
 and learn to fly and do all these other great things.

2:49:33.520 --> 2:49:35.360
 And so it's a very short read.

2:49:35.360 --> 2:49:37.480
 So if people are interested in that, that's good.

2:49:39.200 --> 2:49:42.240
 The book, which I was lucky enough to read

2:49:42.240 --> 2:49:44.160
 before the movie ever even came out,

2:49:44.160 --> 2:49:47.920
 which is just a pleasure of mine was American Psycho.

2:49:47.920 --> 2:49:49.600
 Just from a writing standpoint,

2:49:49.600 --> 2:49:52.760
 I found that the writing was awesome.

2:49:52.760 --> 2:49:54.360
 Brett Easton Ellis is the author of that

2:49:54.360 --> 2:49:55.280
 and several other books

2:49:55.280 --> 2:49:57.520
 who have like intertwining characters.

2:49:57.520 --> 2:49:59.000
 He's a New England prep school guy.

2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:00.680
 And so a lot of like the stories

2:50:00.680 --> 2:50:05.400
 and a lot of the visuals rang true for me

2:50:05.400 --> 2:50:07.760
 and anyone who can write four pages of prose

2:50:07.760 --> 2:50:10.480
 on like a Huey Lewis album, I mean, kudos to you.

2:50:11.640 --> 2:50:14.720
 And I also would say no one will do this,

2:50:14.720 --> 2:50:19.600
 but I would at some point read as much

2:50:19.600 --> 2:50:23.120
 of one of the big three religious texts as possible.

2:50:24.080 --> 2:50:25.480
 It really gives you perspective.

2:50:25.480 --> 2:50:30.280
 There are so many overlapping stories of religious texts.

2:50:30.280 --> 2:50:31.760
 And then the way that they're written

2:50:31.760 --> 2:50:33.680
 gives you a unique perspective

2:50:33.680 --> 2:50:37.520
 on different people throughout the world.

2:50:37.520 --> 2:50:41.160
 And if you're a Roman Catholic,

2:50:41.160 --> 2:50:43.640
 maybe don't read the Bible, read one of the other texts.

2:50:43.640 --> 2:50:45.800
 And that would be an interesting take, but.

2:50:45.800 --> 2:50:47.400
 I'm embarrassed to say that, first of all,

2:50:47.400 --> 2:50:50.520
 I've never read the Bible, which is embarrassing to say.

2:50:50.520 --> 2:50:52.200
 It's like I read a bunch of stuff about the Bible

2:50:52.200 --> 2:50:53.160
 and not the Bible itself.

2:50:53.160 --> 2:50:55.240
 And the same, not equating them,

2:50:55.240 --> 2:50:58.560
 but I haven't read Marx directly.

2:50:58.560 --> 2:51:01.200
 I haven't read Mein Kampf by Hitler directly.

2:51:01.200 --> 2:51:02.360
 And it feels like sometimes,

2:51:02.360 --> 2:51:05.000
 cause you think like it's better to read stuff

2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:08.360
 about the books, but ultimately you want,

2:51:08.360 --> 2:51:10.440
 because like the analysis will be better

2:51:10.440 --> 2:51:13.960
 in texts that followed it,

2:51:13.960 --> 2:51:18.960
 but there's value to actually reading like the actual words.

2:51:20.680 --> 2:51:22.880
 Yeah, there's this power in the words

2:51:22.880 --> 2:51:25.920
 that there's a reason why like the Bible

2:51:25.920 --> 2:51:29.040
 is one of the most impactful books ever.

2:51:29.040 --> 2:51:32.120
 You know, it's in those words

2:51:32.120 --> 2:51:34.960
 and it's a value to return to those words.

2:51:34.960 --> 2:51:36.920
 The communist manifesto is truly frightening

2:51:36.920 --> 2:51:40.360
 if you read it in like modern context.

2:51:41.880 --> 2:51:42.760
 It's worth reading.

2:51:42.760 --> 2:51:43.600
 Yeah.

2:51:43.600 --> 2:51:44.440
 It's worth reading.

2:51:44.440 --> 2:51:46.240
 And so is Mein Kampf, not obviously,

2:51:46.240 --> 2:51:50.720
 well, it's not obvious, but it is not very well written,

2:51:50.720 --> 2:51:53.520
 but all the ideas that led to the evil that is Hitler

2:51:53.520 --> 2:51:57.640
 are all in there, which is fascinating to think about

2:51:57.640 --> 2:51:59.920
 because probably some of the world leaders at the time

2:51:59.920 --> 2:52:01.040
 should have probably read the books.

2:52:01.040 --> 2:52:02.840
 He outlined everything he's gonna do.

2:52:02.840 --> 2:52:07.840
 Offline, you mentioned an Emerson quote that I really like.

2:52:08.560 --> 2:52:12.440
 So let's try to end on this powerful quote.

2:52:12.440 --> 2:52:15.000
 It's easy in the world to live after the world's opinion.

2:52:15.000 --> 2:52:17.400
 It's easy in solitude to live after your own.

2:52:17.400 --> 2:52:19.640
 The great man is who in the midst of the world

2:52:19.640 --> 2:52:22.640
 keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.

2:52:24.320 --> 2:52:26.440
 What does this quote mean to you?

2:52:26.440 --> 2:52:29.920
 It kind of reinforces the idea

2:52:29.920 --> 2:52:33.200
 that you're here to live your life

2:52:33.200 --> 2:52:36.520
 and that even when people are trying to

2:52:39.400 --> 2:52:43.680
 influence you or comment on the decisions

2:52:43.680 --> 2:52:44.800
 that you make for your life,

2:52:44.800 --> 2:52:48.760
 you should have the strength to stick by living your life

2:52:48.760 --> 2:52:50.480
 the way you want to live it,

2:52:50.480 --> 2:52:53.480
 that there's one immutable truth for you

2:52:53.480 --> 2:52:55.360
 and it doesn't apply to everyone.

2:52:55.360 --> 2:53:00.360
 And so people who frown upon

2:53:03.920 --> 2:53:06.440
 or judge the way that you live

2:53:06.440 --> 2:53:10.160
 because it's not, air quotes, conventional,

2:53:10.160 --> 2:53:13.320
 their opinion should not be something

2:53:13.320 --> 2:53:17.080
 that impacts the choices that you make.

2:53:17.080 --> 2:53:18.600
 You're in a relationship now.

2:53:18.600 --> 2:53:20.640
 Yes. Is that deeply meaningful?

2:53:20.640 --> 2:53:23.120
 Or are you ultimately still alone?

2:53:23.120 --> 2:53:24.920
 Are you still just a man in the cold

2:53:24.920 --> 2:53:27.480
 of the life that is suffering?

2:53:27.480 --> 2:53:30.440
 No, I'm a man who's warm, nestled in a bosom.

2:53:31.320 --> 2:53:34.800
 I don't think there's a better way to end, John.

2:53:37.320 --> 2:53:39.240
 You're a friend, you're my coach.

2:53:39.240 --> 2:53:41.440
 I'm sure we'll talk many more times in the future.

2:53:41.440 --> 2:53:44.600
 Thanks for wasting all your time with me today.

2:53:44.600 --> 2:53:45.440
 Thanks brother.

2:53:45.440 --> 2:53:46.760
 Thanks Lex, I had an awesome time.

2:53:46.760 --> 2:53:56.760
 Hope to be back soon.

2:54:16.760 --> 2:54:40.520
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
