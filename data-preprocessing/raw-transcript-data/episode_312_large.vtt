00:00.000 --> 00:03.520
 If this is a super intelligence, if it's folding proteins

00:03.520 --> 00:06.160
 and analyzing like all data sets

00:06.160 --> 00:08.320
 and all whatever they give it access to,

00:08.320 --> 00:11.200
 how can we be certain that it's not gonna figure out

00:11.200 --> 00:14.240
 how to get itself out of the cloud,

00:14.240 --> 00:17.280
 how to store itself in other like mediums,

00:17.280 --> 00:21.400
 trees, the optic nerve, the brain, you know what I mean?

00:21.400 --> 00:22.360
 We don't know that.

00:22.360 --> 00:25.280
 We don't know that it won't leap out and like start hanging.

00:25.280 --> 00:28.280
 Like, and then at that point, now we do have the wildfire.

00:28.280 --> 00:30.600
 Now you can't stop it, you can't unplug it.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.360
 You can't shut your servers down

00:32.360 --> 00:34.740
 because it left the box, left the room

00:34.740 --> 00:37.400
 using some technology you haven't even discovered yet.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.760
 How fucking cool would that be for like the men in black

00:40.760 --> 00:42.800
 to come to me like, listen,

00:42.800 --> 00:45.240
 I need you to infiltrate the fucking comedy scene.

00:47.400 --> 00:50.420
 The following is a conversation with Duncan Trussell,

00:50.420 --> 00:51.720
 a standup comedian,

00:51.720 --> 00:54.920
 host of the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast

00:54.920 --> 00:57.200
 and one of my favorite human beings.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.360
 I've been a fan of his for many years.

00:59.360 --> 01:02.680
 So it was a huge honor and pleasure to meet him

01:02.680 --> 01:06.880
 for the first time and to sit down for this chat.

01:06.880 --> 01:09.080
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:09.080 --> 01:11.120
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:11.120 --> 01:12.440
 in the description.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.860
 And now, dear friends, here's Duncan Trussell.

01:16.840 --> 01:18.740
 Nietzsche has this thought experiment

01:18.740 --> 01:21.080
 called eternal recurrence,

01:21.080 --> 01:23.760
 where you get to relive your whole life

01:23.760 --> 01:25.160
 over and over and over and over.

01:25.160 --> 01:30.160
 And I think it's a way to bring to the surface of your mind

01:30.360 --> 01:33.360
 the idea that every single moment in your life matters.

01:33.360 --> 01:36.080
 It intensely matters, the bad and the good.

01:36.080 --> 01:40.360
 And he kind of wants you to imagine that idea

01:40.360 --> 01:43.120
 that every single decision you make throughout your life,

01:43.120 --> 01:44.920
 you repeat over and over and over,

01:44.920 --> 01:46.600
 and he wants you to respond to that.

01:46.600 --> 01:47.980
 Do you feel horrible about that

01:47.980 --> 01:49.480
 or do you feel good about that?

01:49.480 --> 01:51.720
 And you have to think through this idea

01:51.720 --> 01:54.220
 in order to see where you stand in life.

01:54.220 --> 01:56.080
 What is your relationship like with life?

01:56.080 --> 01:58.920
 I actually wanna read the way he first introduces

01:58.920 --> 02:02.980
 that concept for people who are not familiar.

02:02.980 --> 02:05.600
 What if some day or night a demon,

02:05.600 --> 02:09.600
 by the way, he has a demon introduce this thought experiment.

02:09.600 --> 02:13.240
 What if some day or night a demon were to steal after you

02:13.240 --> 02:18.240
 into your loneliest loneliness and say to you, quote,

02:18.540 --> 02:21.720
 this life as you now live it and have lived it,

02:21.720 --> 02:23.560
 you will have to live once more.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.920
 And innumerable times more.

02:25.920 --> 02:28.080
 And there will be nothing new in it.

02:28.080 --> 02:31.280
 But every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh

02:31.280 --> 02:35.240
 and everything unutterably small and great in your life

02:35.240 --> 02:37.000
 will have to return to you,

02:37.000 --> 02:40.040
 all in the same succession and sequence.

02:40.040 --> 02:43.000
 Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth

02:43.000 --> 02:45.960
 and curse the demon who spoke thus?

02:45.960 --> 02:49.380
 Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment

02:49.380 --> 02:51.560
 when you would have answered him,

02:51.560 --> 02:55.920
 you are a God and never have I heard anything more divine.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.000
 So are you terrified or excited

02:58.000 --> 02:59.220
 by such a thought experiment

02:59.220 --> 03:00.600
 when you apply it to your own life?

03:00.600 --> 03:01.920
 Excited.

03:01.920 --> 03:02.860
 Excited.

03:02.860 --> 03:03.700
 Oh.

03:03.700 --> 03:04.520
 Even the dark stuff.

03:04.520 --> 03:05.680
 Oh yeah, for sure.

03:05.680 --> 03:06.520
 Definitely.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.020
 I mean, also that thing you're talking about,

03:10.280 --> 03:13.280
 he kind of leaves out maybe on purpose

03:13.280 --> 03:15.120
 because the thought experiment starts falling apart

03:15.120 --> 03:15.960
 a little bit.

03:15.960 --> 03:16.800
 Yeah.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.240
 The amnesia between each loop.

03:19.240 --> 03:22.240
 So the whole thing gets wiped.

03:22.240 --> 03:24.320
 Now, if the amnesia wasn't there

03:24.320 --> 03:29.040
 and yet somehow you are witnessing the non autonomy

03:29.040 --> 03:31.200
 implicit in what he's talking about,

03:31.200 --> 03:32.740
 so you have to kind of watch yourself

03:32.740 --> 03:34.920
 go through this rotten loop,

03:34.920 --> 03:36.480
 then yeah, that's a description.

03:36.480 --> 03:38.800
 There's probably a boredom that comes into that.

03:38.800 --> 03:41.360
 So you don't experience everything anew.

03:41.360 --> 03:42.200
 Exactly.

03:42.200 --> 03:43.440
 So the bad stuff, the good stuff,

03:43.440 --> 03:45.040
 the newness of it is really important.

03:45.040 --> 03:45.940
 That's it, yeah.

03:45.940 --> 03:49.760
 This is the, in Hades, when you die,

03:51.040 --> 03:52.720
 there's a river, I think it's called Leith.

03:52.720 --> 03:53.560
 You ever heard of this?

03:53.560 --> 03:54.380
 L E T H E.

03:54.380 --> 03:57.400
 You drink from it and you don't remember your past lives.

03:57.400 --> 04:00.220
 And then when you're reborn, it's fresh

04:00.220 --> 04:01.760
 and you don't have to, I mean,

04:01.760 --> 04:05.580
 just think of like the amount of psychological help

04:05.580 --> 04:08.200
 you would need to get over all the bullshit

04:08.200 --> 04:10.660
 that happened in prior lives.

04:10.660 --> 04:11.500
 You know what I mean?

04:11.500 --> 04:13.900
 Can you imagine if you're still resentful

04:13.900 --> 04:16.920
 of something someone did to you in the 14th century,

04:16.920 --> 04:19.000
 but it would compound.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.400
 Well, if you repeat the same thing over and over and over,

04:22.400 --> 04:23.840
 there would be no difference.

04:23.840 --> 04:26.860
 Maybe you would start to appreciate the nuances more,

04:26.860 --> 04:29.600
 like when you watch the same movie over and over and over,

04:29.600 --> 04:34.600
 maybe you'll get to actually let go of this idea

04:35.520 --> 04:38.860
 of all the possible, all the positive possibilities

04:38.860 --> 04:39.700
 that lay before you,

04:39.700 --> 04:41.400
 but actually enjoy the moment much more.

04:41.400 --> 04:44.320
 If you remember that you've lived this life a thousand times,

04:44.320 --> 04:47.260
 all the little things, the way somebody smiles,

04:47.260 --> 04:49.560
 if you're been abused, the way somebody,

04:49.560 --> 04:53.360
 like the pain of it, the suffering, the down that you feel,

04:53.360 --> 04:56.340
 the experience of sadness, depression, fear,

04:56.340 --> 04:57.180
 all that kind of stuff.

04:57.180 --> 04:59.920
 You get to really, you get to also appreciate

04:59.920 --> 05:02.720
 that that's part of life, part of being alive.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.880
 Now, also in his experiment, if I was gonna,

05:04.880 --> 05:07.640
 and I love the experiment from the perspective of like,

05:07.640 --> 05:10.320
 just where technology is now and simulation theory

05:10.320 --> 05:11.160
 and stuff like that.

05:11.160 --> 05:14.200
 But in that thought experiment,

05:14.200 --> 05:19.200
 if this rotten demon immediately killed you,

05:19.840 --> 05:23.200
 then within that, it's a little more horrifying

05:23.200 --> 05:26.840
 because even in the, first of all,

05:26.840 --> 05:28.520
 you're trusting a fucking demon.

05:28.520 --> 05:29.680
 Why are you talking to a demon?

05:29.680 --> 05:30.520
 Let's start there.

05:30.520 --> 05:31.640
 Yeah, because that is gonna be,

05:31.640 --> 05:33.800
 even before I get into like the metaphysics

05:33.800 --> 05:36.960
 and like the implications and where is this life stored?

05:36.960 --> 05:38.040
 Where's the loop stored?

05:38.040 --> 05:41.240
 I mean, are we talking about some kind of unchanging data set

05:41.240 --> 05:42.320
 or something?

05:42.320 --> 05:43.160
 For that, you're like,

05:43.160 --> 05:45.360
 why is there a fucking talking demon in my room

05:45.360 --> 05:47.060
 trying to freak me out?

05:47.060 --> 05:48.660
 You're gonna wanna autopsy the demon.

05:48.660 --> 05:49.500
 Can you catch it?

05:49.500 --> 05:50.680
 Does this apply to you, demon?

05:50.680 --> 05:53.440
 And again, obviously it's a fucking thought experiment.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.720
 Nietzsche would be annoyed by me,

05:54.720 --> 05:58.840
 but I think like you would still be able to entertain

05:58.840 --> 06:01.680
 the joy, you'd have the joy

06:01.680 --> 06:03.520
 of not knowing what's around the corner.

06:03.520 --> 06:05.640
 You know, still, it's not like you know what's coming

06:05.640 --> 06:08.240
 just cause the demon said some kind of loop.

06:08.240 --> 06:10.480
 In other words, the idea of being damned

06:10.480 --> 06:13.960
 to your past decisions, it doesn't even work

06:13.960 --> 06:15.720
 because you can't remember what decisions

06:15.720 --> 06:17.080
 you're about to make.

06:17.080 --> 06:19.240
 So from that perspective also,

06:19.240 --> 06:20.720
 I think I'd be happy about it.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.360
 Or I would just think, oh cool.

06:22.360 --> 06:23.420
 I mean, it's a good story.

06:23.420 --> 06:24.920
 I'm gonna tell people about how this.

06:24.920 --> 06:27.120
 I wonder what the demon would actually look like in real life

06:27.120 --> 06:30.680
 cause I suspect that would look like a charming,

06:30.680 --> 06:32.280
 like a friend.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.400
 Wouldn't they be a loved one?

06:34.400 --> 06:37.520
 Wouldn't the demon come to you through the mechanism,

06:37.520 --> 06:41.000
 through the front door of love, not through the back door

06:41.000 --> 06:44.480
 of evil, like malevolent manipulation?

06:44.480 --> 06:46.760
 Sure, I mean, if it's the truth,

06:46.760 --> 06:50.280
 if it's the truth and that's whether it's love or not,

06:50.280 --> 06:53.400
 it's still good fundamentally.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.060
 I do like the idea of the memory replay.

06:56.060 --> 07:00.240
 I remember I went to a Newer Link event a few years ago

07:00.240 --> 07:02.900
 and got to hang out with Elon.

07:02.900 --> 07:06.440
 I remember how visceral it is that there's like a pig

07:06.440 --> 07:09.400
 with a Newer Link in it.

07:09.400 --> 07:13.080
 And you're talking about memory replays as a future,

07:13.080 --> 07:15.240
 maybe far future possibility.

07:15.240 --> 07:17.960
 And you realize, well, this is a very meaningful moment

07:17.960 --> 07:19.360
 in my life.

07:19.360 --> 07:21.140
 This could be a replay.

07:21.140 --> 07:25.440
 Of all the things you replay, it's probably,

07:25.440 --> 07:28.080
 there's certain magical moments in your life.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.720
 Whatever it is, certain people you've met for the first time

07:30.720 --> 07:33.120
 or certain things you've done for the first time

07:33.120 --> 07:36.360
 with certain people or just an awesome thing you did.

07:36.360 --> 07:38.400
 And I remember just saying to him,

07:38.400 --> 07:41.440
 like, I would probably want to replay this,

07:43.080 --> 07:44.080
 this moment.

07:44.080 --> 07:46.320
 And it just seemed very kind of,

07:47.560 --> 07:49.120
 I mean, there was a recursive nature to it,

07:49.120 --> 07:52.960
 but it seemed very real that this is something

07:52.960 --> 07:56.280
 we would want to do, that the richness of life

07:56.280 --> 07:59.560
 could be experienced through the replay.

07:59.560 --> 08:02.200
 That's probably where it's experienced the most.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.280
 You could see life as a way to collect

08:04.280 --> 08:06.760
 a bunch of cool memories, and then you get to sit back

08:06.760 --> 08:10.240
 in your nice VR headset and replay the cool ones.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.280
 That's right.

08:11.280 --> 08:16.120
 This is, in Buddhism, the idea that I struggle with

08:16.120 --> 08:20.620
 is that there's a possibility of not reincarnating,

08:20.620 --> 08:21.640
 of not coming back.

08:21.640 --> 08:22.720
 That's the idea.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.180
 This is suffering here.

08:25.180 --> 08:27.240
 The suffering is caused by attachment.

08:27.240 --> 08:32.240
 And so if you like revise the idea of reincarnation

08:32.560 --> 08:37.560
 or the Nietzsche's loop and look at it from,

08:38.000 --> 08:39.240
 could this be possible?

08:39.240 --> 08:42.440
 Or how would this be possible technologically?

08:42.440 --> 08:45.920
 Then to me, it makes a lot of sense.

08:45.920 --> 08:48.600
 Like I've been thinking a lot about this very thing

08:48.600 --> 08:51.640
 and the Nietzsche's idea connecting to it.

08:51.640 --> 08:54.920
 I had this like, it sounds so dumb,

08:54.920 --> 08:58.280
 but I was at the dentist getting nitrous oxide,

08:58.280 --> 08:59.920
 high as a fucking kite, man.

08:59.920 --> 09:03.880
 And I had this idea, I was thinking about data.

09:03.880 --> 09:07.700
 I was thinking like, man, probably, if I had to bet,

09:07.700 --> 09:11.320
 there's some energetic form that we're not aware of

09:11.320 --> 09:14.160
 that for a super advanced technology

09:14.160 --> 09:17.640
 would be as detectable as like starlight,

09:17.640 --> 09:19.960
 but something that we just don't even know what it is.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.160
 Quantum turbulence, who the fuck knows?

09:22.160 --> 09:24.440
 Fill in the blank, whatever that X may be.

09:24.440 --> 09:27.820
 But assuming that exists, that somehow data,

09:27.820 --> 09:30.680
 even the most subtle things, the tiniest movements,

09:30.680 --> 09:31.960
 whatever it may be,

09:31.960 --> 09:36.080
 the emanations of your neurological process energetically,

09:36.080 --> 09:39.420
 whatever it may be, is radiating out in the space time,

09:39.420 --> 09:44.360
 then what if like the James Webb version of this

09:44.360 --> 09:47.380
 for some advanced civilization is not that they're like

09:47.380 --> 09:50.320
 looking at the nebula or whatever,

09:50.320 --> 09:53.120
 but they're actually able to peer into the past

09:53.120 --> 09:57.200
 and via some bizarre technology recreate whatever life,

09:57.200 --> 09:59.640
 simulate whatever life was happening there

09:59.640 --> 10:02.840
 just by decoding that quantum energy, whatever it is.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.940
 I'm only saying quantum because it's what dumb people say

10:04.940 --> 10:05.780
 when they don't know.

10:05.780 --> 10:07.400
 You just say quantum, I don't know.

10:07.400 --> 10:08.560
 But you know what I mean?

10:08.560 --> 10:09.480
 You're decoding that.

10:09.480 --> 10:12.520
 So meaning, in simulation theory,

10:12.520 --> 10:16.720
 one of the big questions that pops up is why

10:16.720 --> 10:18.120
 and are we in one?

10:18.120 --> 10:19.920
 And Elon has talked about,

10:19.920 --> 10:21.240
 well, it's probably more of a probability

10:21.240 --> 10:24.120
 than we're in one than we're not, in which case,

10:24.120 --> 10:27.400
 what you're talking about is actually happening,

10:27.400 --> 10:30.040
 that that loop you're talking about,

10:30.040 --> 10:32.520
 we've decided to be here.

10:32.520 --> 10:36.240
 This, of all the things, we decided this one,

10:36.240 --> 10:37.540
 oh, let's do that one again.

10:37.540 --> 10:38.480
 I wanna do that one.

10:38.480 --> 10:40.680
 Let's try, let's do that.

10:40.680 --> 10:44.000
 I love thinking about this because I love my family.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.920
 And it makes sense to me that if I'm going to replay

10:46.920 --> 10:49.680
 some life or another, it's definitely gonna be this one

10:49.680 --> 10:51.560
 with my kids, my wife,

10:51.560 --> 10:53.500
 with all the bullshit that's gone along with it,

10:53.500 --> 10:55.160
 I'm still gonna wanna come back.

10:55.160 --> 10:57.360
 So in Buddhism, that's attachment.

10:57.360 --> 10:58.840
 Yeah, but you weren't the one,

10:58.840 --> 11:00.440
 oh, you're saying that you're the main player,

11:00.440 --> 11:01.820
 you're not the NPC.

11:01.820 --> 11:04.720
 Well, I think we're dealing with all NPCs at this point.

11:04.720 --> 11:06.360
 I mean, depending on how you wanna,

11:06.360 --> 11:08.800
 like very, I would say very advanced NPCs,

11:08.800 --> 11:11.460
 like incredibly advanced NPCs

11:11.460 --> 11:14.200
 compared to Fallout or something.

11:14.200 --> 11:17.240
 We've got a lot of conversation options happening here.

11:17.240 --> 11:20.680
 There's not like four things you can pick from.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.720
 Yeah, there's a whole illusion of free will

11:23.720 --> 11:24.660
 that's happening.

11:24.660 --> 11:28.320
 We really do, depending where you are in the world,

11:28.320 --> 11:31.000
 feel like you're free to decide any trajectory

11:31.000 --> 11:32.100
 in your life that you want.

11:32.100 --> 11:33.600
 Which is pretty funny, right?

11:33.600 --> 11:36.080
 For an NPC, it's pretty, it's nice.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.120
 Well, you're gonna want that.

11:37.120 --> 11:38.240
 If we're making a video game,

11:38.240 --> 11:41.560
 you do wanna give your NPCs the illusion of free will

11:41.560 --> 11:44.120
 because it's gonna make interactions with them

11:44.120 --> 11:47.440
 that much more intense.

11:47.440 --> 11:52.180
 Yeah, so I wonder on the path to that,

11:52.180 --> 11:54.340
 how hard is it to create,

11:54.340 --> 11:56.160
 this is sort of the Carmack question

11:56.160 --> 12:01.160
 of a realistic virtual world that's as cool as this one.

12:02.020 --> 12:05.800
 Not fully realistic, but sufficiently realistic

12:05.800 --> 12:08.760
 that it's as interesting to live in.

12:08.760 --> 12:11.040
 Because we're gonna have to create those worlds

12:11.040 --> 12:15.040
 on the path to creating something like a simulation.

12:15.040 --> 12:17.040
 Like long, long, long before.

12:17.040 --> 12:20.080
 It'd be virtual worlds where we'd wanna stay forever

12:20.080 --> 12:25.080
 because they're full of that balance of suffering and joy,

12:27.240 --> 12:29.920
 of limitations and freedoms and all that kind of stuff.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.160
 A lot of people think like in the virtual world,

12:32.160 --> 12:35.320
 I can't wait to be able to, I don't know,

12:35.320 --> 12:39.840
 have sex with anybody I want or have anything I want.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.560
 But I think that's not gonna be fun.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.920
 You want the limitations, the constraints.

12:44.920 --> 12:47.120
 So you have to battle for the things you want.

12:47.120 --> 12:50.640
 Okay, but, okay, but great video games.

12:50.640 --> 12:52.480
 One of my favorite video game memories

12:52.480 --> 12:54.620
 was like I started playing World of Warcraft

12:54.620 --> 12:57.800
 in its original incarnation.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.360
 And I didn't even know

12:59.360 --> 13:01.100
 that you were gonna have flying mounts.

13:01.100 --> 13:02.160
 Like I didn't even know.

13:02.160 --> 13:03.680
 So I've been running around dealing

13:03.680 --> 13:07.440
 with all the encumbrances of like being an undead warlock

13:07.440 --> 13:08.700
 that can't fly.

13:08.700 --> 13:12.120
 But then all of a sudden, holy shit, there's flying mounts.

13:12.120 --> 13:15.000
 And now the world you've been running around not flying,

13:15.000 --> 13:16.520
 you're seeing it from the top down.

13:16.520 --> 13:18.160
 It was just really cool.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.920
 Like, whoa, I could do this now.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.680
 And then that gets boring.

13:21.680 --> 13:24.240
 But a really well designed game,

13:24.240 --> 13:28.880
 it has a series of these, I don't know what you call it,

13:28.880 --> 13:33.200
 extra abilities that kind of unfold and produce novelty.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.800
 And then eventually you just accept it,

13:35.800 --> 13:37.060
 you take it for granted.

13:37.060 --> 13:40.280
 And then another novelty appears.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.040
 Those extra abilities are always balanced

13:42.040 --> 13:44.860
 with the limitations, the constraints they run up against.

13:44.860 --> 13:48.240
 Because a well balanced video game,

13:48.240 --> 13:51.480
 the challenge, the struggle matches the new ability.

13:51.480 --> 13:54.580
 Yeah, and sometimes causes problems on its own.

13:54.580 --> 13:59.280
 I mean, and so to go back to this universe, this simulation,

13:59.280 --> 14:02.660
 it's really designed like a pretty awesome video game.

14:02.660 --> 14:05.860
 If you look at it from the perspective of history,

14:05.860 --> 14:08.360
 I mean, people were on horses.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.560
 They didn't know that they were gonna be bullet trains.

14:10.560 --> 14:12.960
 They didn't know that you could get in a car

14:12.960 --> 14:15.880
 and drive across the country in a few days.

14:15.880 --> 14:17.480
 That would have sounded ridiculous.

14:17.480 --> 14:18.580
 We're doing that now.

14:18.580 --> 14:21.800
 And even in our own lifespan, think about it.

14:21.800 --> 14:24.400
 How long has VR goggles existed?

14:24.400 --> 14:27.480
 Like the ones that you could just buy at Best Buy.

14:27.480 --> 14:31.380
 I had the original Oculus Rift, the fucking puke machine.

14:31.380 --> 14:34.040
 You put that thing on, I gave it to my friend.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.440
 He went and vomited in my driveway

14:36.440 --> 14:38.640
 and people were making fun of it.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.080
 They were saying, this isn't gonna catch on.

14:40.080 --> 14:43.720
 It's too big, it's unwieldy, the graphics suck.

14:43.720 --> 14:45.720
 And then look at where it's at now.

14:45.720 --> 14:48.040
 And that's going to keep,

14:48.040 --> 14:50.120
 that trajectory is gonna keep improving.

14:50.120 --> 14:53.120
 So yeah, I think that we are dealing

14:53.120 --> 14:54.200
 with what you're talking about,

14:54.200 --> 14:59.200
 which is novelty met with more problems, met with novelty.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.980
 Yeah, I wonder why VR is not more popular.

15:01.980 --> 15:05.380
 I wonder what is going to be the magic thing

15:05.380 --> 15:10.380
 that really convinces a large fraction of the world

15:10.640 --> 15:13.140
 to move into the virtual world.

15:13.140 --> 15:16.780
 I suppose we're already there in the 2D screen

15:16.780 --> 15:19.740
 of Twitter and social media and that kind of stuff.

15:19.740 --> 15:21.400
 And even video games, there's a lot of people

15:21.400 --> 15:26.200
 that get a big sense of community from video games.

15:26.200 --> 15:29.500
 But like, it doesn't feel like you're living there.

15:29.500 --> 15:34.500
 It's like, bye mom, I'm going to this other world.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.900
 Or like you leave your girlfriend

15:37.900 --> 15:40.380
 to go get your digital girlfriend.

15:40.380 --> 15:41.680
 That's gonna be a problem.

15:41.680 --> 15:43.580
 There's less jealousy in the digital world.

15:43.580 --> 15:45.380
 Maybe there should be a lot of jealousy

15:45.380 --> 15:46.380
 in the digital world.

15:46.380 --> 15:49.860
 Cause that's jealousy, a little jealousy

15:49.860 --> 15:52.300
 is probably good for relationships,

15:52.300 --> 15:54.260
 even in the digital world.

15:54.260 --> 15:56.220
 So you're gonna have to simulate all of that kind of stuff.

15:56.220 --> 15:58.440
 But I wonder what the magic thing that says,

15:58.440 --> 16:01.560
 I wanna spend most of my days inside the virtual world.

16:01.560 --> 16:05.620
 Well, clearly it's gonna be something we don't have yet.

16:05.620 --> 16:07.740
 I mean, strapping that damn thing on your face

16:07.740 --> 16:08.700
 still feels weird.

16:08.700 --> 16:09.940
 It's heavy.

16:09.940 --> 16:12.380
 If you're depending on what gear you're using,

16:12.380 --> 16:13.940
 sometimes light can leak in.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.620
 There's just, you gotta recharge it.

16:15.620 --> 16:16.920
 It's hyper limited.

16:16.920 --> 16:21.920
 And then, so yeah, it's gonna have to be something

16:23.380 --> 16:27.580
 that like simulates taste, smell.

16:27.580 --> 16:29.380
 You think taste and smell are important touch?

16:29.380 --> 16:30.860
 I do, yeah.

16:30.860 --> 16:34.580
 I can't just do, in World War II, you would write letters.

16:34.580 --> 16:36.660
 You could still, don't you think you can convey love

16:36.660 --> 16:38.140
 with just words?

16:38.140 --> 16:39.300
 For sure.

16:39.300 --> 16:42.140
 But I think for what you're talking about to happen,

16:42.140 --> 16:45.180
 it has to be fully immersive.

16:45.180 --> 16:49.300
 So that it's not that you feel like you're walking

16:49.300 --> 16:50.640
 cause it looks like you're walking,

16:50.640 --> 16:52.740
 but that your brain is sending signals

16:52.740 --> 16:54.960
 telling your body that you're walking,

16:54.960 --> 16:57.220
 that you feel the wind blowing in your face,

16:57.220 --> 16:58.940
 not because of some, I don't know,

16:58.940 --> 17:01.260
 fan or something that it's connected to,

17:01.260 --> 17:03.940
 but because somehow it's figured out

17:03.940 --> 17:06.740
 how to hack into the human brain

17:06.740 --> 17:10.460
 and send those signals minus some external thing.

17:10.460 --> 17:13.960
 Once that happens, I'd say we're gonna see

17:13.960 --> 17:18.380
 a complete radical shift in everything.

17:18.380 --> 17:19.540
 See, I disagree with you.

17:19.540 --> 17:21.380
 I don't know if you've seen the movie Her.

17:21.380 --> 17:22.540
 Yeah.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.520
 I think you can go to another world

17:24.520 --> 17:27.340
 in where a digital being lives in the darkness

17:27.340 --> 17:32.060
 and all you hear is Scarlett Johansson voice talking to you

17:32.060 --> 17:34.740
 and she lives there or he lives there,

17:34.740 --> 17:37.160
 your friend, your loved one,

17:38.140 --> 17:40.060
 and all you have is voice and words.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.540
 And I think that could be sufficient

17:42.540 --> 17:44.140
 to pull you into that world

17:44.140 --> 17:47.300
 where you look forward to that moment all day.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.460
 You never wanna leave the darkness,

17:49.460 --> 17:51.620
 just closing your eyes and listening to the voice.

17:51.620 --> 17:55.660
 I think those basic mediums of communication

17:55.660 --> 17:56.500
 is still enough.

17:56.500 --> 17:58.580
 Like language is really, really powerful.

17:58.580 --> 18:00.940
 And I think the realism of touch and smell

18:00.940 --> 18:02.700
 and all that kind of stuff

18:02.700 --> 18:04.540
 is not nearly as powerful as language.

18:04.540 --> 18:07.260
 That's what makes humans really special

18:07.260 --> 18:09.580
 is our ability to communicate with each other.

18:09.580 --> 18:12.460
 That's the sense of like deep connection we get

18:12.460 --> 18:13.800
 is through communication.

18:13.800 --> 18:16.140
 Now that communication could involve touch.

18:16.140 --> 18:20.300
 Like, you know, hugging feels damn good.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.860
 You see a good friend, you hug.

18:22.900 --> 18:25.980
 That's one of the big things with doing COVID with Rogan.

18:25.980 --> 18:29.100
 When you see him, there's a giant hug coming your way

18:29.100 --> 18:33.340
 and that makes you feel like, yeah, this feels great.

18:33.340 --> 18:36.020
 But I think that can be just with language.

18:36.020 --> 18:40.800
 I think for a lot of people that's true,

18:40.800 --> 18:45.800
 but we're talking like massive adoption

18:46.140 --> 18:49.060
 of a technology by the world.

18:49.060 --> 18:51.800
 And if language was just enough,

18:52.980 --> 18:55.500
 we wouldn't be selling TVs.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.660
 People will be reading.

18:57.660 --> 19:01.220
 They wanna watch, they wanna see, you know?

19:01.220 --> 19:02.620
 But I agree with you, man.

19:02.620 --> 19:04.500
 When you're getting absorbed into a book

19:04.500 --> 19:06.140
 and especially if you've got,

19:06.140 --> 19:08.740
 I think a lot of us went through a weird dark ages

19:08.740 --> 19:09.980
 when it came to reading.

19:09.980 --> 19:12.440
 Like when I was a kid and there wasn't the option

19:12.440 --> 19:16.140
 for these hypno rectangles, that's just what you did.

19:16.140 --> 19:17.780
 There wasn't even anything special about it.

19:17.780 --> 19:19.500
 What's a hypno rectangle? Your phone.

19:19.500 --> 19:20.820
 You know, it was like, you didn't,

19:20.820 --> 19:22.060
 when that gravity well.

19:22.060 --> 19:24.340
 Hypno rectangle, gravity well.

19:24.340 --> 19:26.340
 It is. Attention, gravity well, yeah.

19:26.340 --> 19:28.260
 When we weren't feeling the pull of these things

19:28.260 --> 19:30.540
 all the time, you would just read

19:30.540 --> 19:33.100
 and you weren't patting yourself on the back about reading.

19:33.100 --> 19:34.380
 You just, that's what you had.

19:34.380 --> 19:37.740
 You had that and you had like eight channels on the TV

19:37.740 --> 19:39.340
 and a shitty VCR.

19:39.340 --> 19:42.440
 So, you know, then a lot of people stop reading

19:42.440 --> 19:43.660
 because of these things, you know,

19:43.660 --> 19:44.620
 or they think they're reading

19:44.620 --> 19:47.940
 because they are technically reading, but you know,

19:47.940 --> 19:51.940
 when you return to reading after a pause, whoa,

19:51.940 --> 19:54.540
 and you realize how powerful this simulator is

19:54.540 --> 19:57.300
 when it's given the right code of language,

19:57.300 --> 19:59.580
 whoa, holy shit, it's incredible.

19:59.580 --> 20:03.500
 I mean, it's like, again, it's the most embarrassing

20:03.500 --> 20:06.060
 kind of like, whoa, wow, what do you know?

20:06.060 --> 20:07.700
 Books are really good.

20:07.700 --> 20:09.660
 But still, if you've been away from it for a while

20:09.660 --> 20:11.940
 and you revisit it, I know what you're saying.

20:11.940 --> 20:16.660
 I just think probably it's not gonna go in that direction,

20:16.660 --> 20:18.060
 even though you are right.

20:18.060 --> 20:19.660
 Ultimately, I think you're right.

20:19.660 --> 20:23.780
 Yeah, because our brain is the imagination engine we have

20:23.780 --> 20:25.380
 is able to fill in the gaps better

20:25.380 --> 20:27.780
 than a lot of graphics engines could.

20:27.780 --> 20:30.060
 And so if there's a way to incentivize humans

20:30.060 --> 20:33.000
 to become addicted to the use of imagination,

20:33.000 --> 20:36.080
 it's like, you know, that's the downside of things like porn

20:36.080 --> 20:39.380
 that remove the need for imagination for people.

20:39.380 --> 20:41.000
 And in that same way, video games

20:41.000 --> 20:43.740
 that are becoming ultra realistic,

20:43.740 --> 20:45.180
 you don't have to imagine anything.

20:45.180 --> 20:48.660
 And I feel like the imagination is a really powerful tool

20:48.660 --> 20:50.120
 that needs to be leveraged.

20:50.120 --> 20:53.560
 Because to simulate reality sufficiently realistically

20:53.560 --> 20:57.820
 that we would be perfectly fooled,

20:57.820 --> 20:59.860
 technically it's very hard.

20:59.860 --> 21:03.820
 And so I think we need to somehow leverage imagination.

21:03.820 --> 21:06.280
 Sure, I mean, yeah, I mean, this is like,

21:06.280 --> 21:10.480
 this is what I love and is so creepy

21:10.480 --> 21:15.400
 about like the current AI chatbots, you know,

21:15.400 --> 21:16.540
 is that it's like,

21:16.540 --> 21:18.280
 it's the relationship between you and the thing

21:18.280 --> 21:21.800
 and the way that it can via whatever the algorithms are.

21:21.800 --> 21:24.940
 And by the way, I have no idea how these things work, you do.

21:24.940 --> 21:27.500
 I just, you know, speculate about what they mean

21:27.500 --> 21:28.340
 or where it's going.

21:28.340 --> 21:30.240
 But there's something about the relation

21:30.240 --> 21:35.000
 between the consumer and the technology.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.160
 And when that technology starts shifting

21:37.160 --> 21:40.080
 according to what it perceives

21:40.080 --> 21:43.760
 that the consumer is looking for or isn't looking for,

21:43.760 --> 21:47.360
 then at that point, I think that's where you run into the,

21:48.240 --> 21:49.880
 you know, yeah, it doesn't matter

21:49.880 --> 21:54.280
 if the reality that you're in is like photo realism

21:54.280 --> 21:56.560
 for it to be sticky and immersive.

21:56.560 --> 21:59.920
 It's when the reality that you're in is via cues

21:59.920 --> 22:01.640
 you might not even be aware of,

22:01.640 --> 22:06.280
 or via your digital imprint on Facebook or wherever,

22:06.280 --> 22:11.200
 when it's warping itself to that to seduce you,

22:11.200 --> 22:15.040
 holy shit, man, that's where it becomes something alien,

22:15.040 --> 22:17.440
 something, you know, when you're reading a book,

22:18.360 --> 22:21.760
 obviously the book is not shifting

22:21.760 --> 22:23.740
 according to its perception

22:23.740 --> 22:26.640
 of what parts of the book you like.

22:26.640 --> 22:28.760
 But when you imagine that,

22:28.760 --> 22:30.580
 imagine a book that could do that,

22:30.580 --> 22:32.760
 a book that could sense somehow

22:32.760 --> 22:34.280
 that you're really enjoying this character

22:34.280 --> 22:35.860
 more than another, you know?

22:35.860 --> 22:37.920
 And depending on the style of book,

22:38.980 --> 22:40.720
 kills that fucking character off

22:40.720 --> 22:43.080
 or lets that character continue.

22:43.080 --> 22:48.080
 I mean, that to me is sort of the where AI and VR,

22:48.680 --> 22:51.720
 when those two things come together,

22:51.720 --> 22:54.780
 whoa, man, that's where you're in,

22:54.780 --> 22:56.520
 that's where you really are gonna find yourself

22:56.520 --> 22:58.120
 in a Skinner box, you know?

22:58.120 --> 23:03.120
 So the dynamic storytelling that senses your anxiety

23:03.680 --> 23:06.240
 and tries to, there's a kind of this,

23:06.240 --> 23:08.680
 in psychology, this arousal curve.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.800
 So there's a dynamic storytelling

23:10.800 --> 23:12.440
 that keeps you sufficiently aroused

23:12.440 --> 23:14.560
 in terms of, not sexually aroused,

23:14.560 --> 23:16.080
 like in terms of anxiety,

23:16.080 --> 23:18.240
 but not too much where you freak out.

23:18.240 --> 23:21.420
 It's this perfect balance where you're always on edge,

23:21.420 --> 23:23.720
 excited, scared, that kind of stuff,

23:23.720 --> 23:25.040
 and the story unrolls.

23:25.040 --> 23:27.140
 It breaks your heart to where you're pissed,

23:27.140 --> 23:29.080
 but then it makes you feel good again,

23:29.080 --> 23:30.600
 and finds that balance.

23:30.600 --> 23:32.060
 Yeah.

23:32.060 --> 23:33.600
 The chatbots scare you, though?

23:34.800 --> 23:36.920
 I'd love to sort of hear your thoughts

23:36.920 --> 23:38.240
 about where they are today,

23:38.240 --> 23:41.180
 because there is a different perspective

23:41.180 --> 23:44.880
 we have on this thing, because I do know,

23:44.880 --> 23:47.720
 and I'm excited about a lot of the different technologies

23:47.720 --> 23:52.720
 that feed AI systems, that feed these kind of chatbots.

23:52.720 --> 23:55.920
 And you're more a little bit, on the consumer side,

23:55.920 --> 23:58.280
 you're a philosopher of sorts.

23:58.280 --> 24:01.720
 They're able to interact with AI systems,

24:01.720 --> 24:05.280
 but also able to introspect about the negative

24:05.280 --> 24:07.360
 and the positive things about those AI systems.

24:07.360 --> 24:10.560
 There's that story with a Google engineer saying that.

24:10.560 --> 24:12.160
 I had him on my podcast, Blake Lemoine.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.000
 You did.

24:13.000 --> 24:13.840
 What was that like?

24:13.840 --> 24:17.040
 What was your perspective of that,

24:17.040 --> 24:19.880
 looking at that as a particular example

24:19.880 --> 24:24.640
 of a human being being captivated

24:24.640 --> 24:26.960
 by the interactions with an AI system?

24:26.960 --> 24:31.840
 Well, number one, when you hear that anyone is claiming

24:31.840 --> 24:35.000
 that an AI has become sentient,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.240
 you should be skeptical about that.

24:37.240 --> 24:39.960
 I mean, this is a good thing to be skeptical about,

24:39.960 --> 24:42.000
 and so initially when I heard that,

24:42.000 --> 24:45.120
 I was like, ah, it's probably just, who knows?

24:45.120 --> 24:46.960
 Somebody who's a little confused or something.

24:46.960 --> 24:49.380
 So when you're talking to them and you realize,

24:49.380 --> 24:51.440
 oh, not only is he not confused,

24:51.440 --> 24:54.400
 he's also open to all possibilities.

24:54.400 --> 24:57.060
 He doesn't seem like he's super committed

24:57.060 --> 24:59.360
 other than the fact that he's like, this is my experience.

24:59.360 --> 25:00.760
 This is what's happening.

25:00.760 --> 25:01.920
 This is what it is.

25:01.920 --> 25:05.080
 So to me, there's something really cool about that,

25:05.080 --> 25:08.480
 which is like, oh shit, I don't get to lean into like,

25:08.480 --> 25:12.260
 I'm not quite sure your perceptual apparatus

25:12.260 --> 25:15.380
 is necessarily like, I don't,

25:15.380 --> 25:18.080
 you know, in the UFO community,

25:18.080 --> 25:19.680
 I think I've just learned this term.

25:19.680 --> 25:24.540
 It's called, instead of gaslighting, swamp gassing,

25:24.540 --> 25:25.780
 which is, you know what I mean?

25:25.780 --> 25:28.720
 People have this experience, you're like, it was swamp gas.

25:28.720 --> 25:30.080
 You didn't see the thing.

25:30.080 --> 25:33.400
 And you know, skeptical people, we have that tendency.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.560
 If you hear an anomalous experience,

25:35.560 --> 25:39.640
 your first thought more than likely is gonna be really,

25:39.640 --> 25:40.980
 it could have been this or that or whatever.

25:40.980 --> 25:45.980
 So to me, he seems really reliable, friendly, cool,

25:45.980 --> 25:48.580
 and like, it doesn't really seem like

25:48.580 --> 25:49.820
 he has much of an agenda.

25:49.820 --> 25:53.780
 Like, you know, going public about some thing happening

25:53.780 --> 25:56.820
 at Google is not a great thing

25:56.820 --> 25:58.500
 if you wanna keep working at Google.

25:58.500 --> 26:02.360
 You know, it's, I don't know what benefit

26:02.360 --> 26:03.900
 he's getting from it necessarily.

26:03.900 --> 26:05.980
 But all that being said,

26:05.980 --> 26:09.660
 the other thing that's culturally was interesting

26:09.660 --> 26:12.620
 and is interesting about it is the blowback he got,

26:12.620 --> 26:16.740
 the passionate blowback from people

26:16.740 --> 26:20.260
 who hadn't even looked into what Lambda is

26:20.260 --> 26:21.960
 or what he was saying Lambda is,

26:21.960 --> 26:25.220
 which they were like saying, you're talking about,

26:25.220 --> 26:27.600
 and you should have your show actually, but.

26:27.600 --> 26:30.700
 There's complexity on top of complexities.

26:30.700 --> 26:32.620
 For me personally, from different perspectives,

26:32.620 --> 26:35.300
 I also, and sorry if I'm interrupting your flow.

26:35.300 --> 26:37.060
 Please interrupt, it's a podcast.

26:37.060 --> 26:40.240
 Yeah, well, we're having multiple podcasts

26:40.240 --> 26:42.500
 in multiple dimensions and I'm just trying

26:42.500 --> 26:44.980
 to figure out which one we wanna plug into.

26:46.460 --> 26:49.780
 I, because I know how a lot of the language models work

26:49.780 --> 26:53.140
 and I work closely with people

26:53.140 --> 26:56.640
 that really make it their life journey

26:56.640 --> 26:59.700
 to create these NLP systems,

26:59.700 --> 27:01.740
 they're focused on the technical details.

27:01.740 --> 27:04.780
 Like a carpenter's working on Pinocchio

27:04.780 --> 27:06.860
 is crafting the different parts of the wood.

27:06.860 --> 27:09.820
 They don't understand when the whole thing comes together,

27:09.820 --> 27:12.220
 there's a magic that can fill the thing.

27:12.220 --> 27:14.260
 Yeah, I definitely know the tension

27:14.260 --> 27:16.900
 between the engineers that create these systems

27:16.900 --> 27:21.100
 and the actual magic that they can create,

27:21.100 --> 27:22.660
 even when they're dumb.

27:22.660 --> 27:24.460
 I guess that's what I'm trying to say.

27:26.180 --> 27:28.140
 What the engineers often say is like,

27:28.140 --> 27:30.820
 well, these systems are not smart enough

27:30.820 --> 27:34.860
 to have sentience or to have the kind of intelligence

27:34.860 --> 27:36.220
 that you're projecting onto it.

27:36.220 --> 27:38.780
 It's pretty dumb, it's just repeating a bunch of things

27:38.780 --> 27:41.300
 that other humans have said and stitching them together

27:41.300 --> 27:42.900
 in interesting ways that are relevant

27:42.900 --> 27:45.980
 to the context of the conversation, it's not smart.

27:45.980 --> 27:47.060
 It doesn't know how to do math.

27:47.060 --> 27:49.580
 To address that specific critique

27:49.580 --> 27:54.080
 from a non programming person's perspective,

27:56.340 --> 27:58.300
 he addressed this on my podcast, which is,

27:58.300 --> 28:00.340
 okay, what you're talking about there,

28:00.340 --> 28:03.140
 the server that's filled with all the,

28:03.140 --> 28:04.940
 whatever it is, what people have said,

28:04.940 --> 28:08.100
 the repository of questions and responses

28:08.100 --> 28:10.200
 and the algorithm that weaves those things together

28:10.200 --> 28:14.260
 to produce it using some crazy statistical engine,

28:14.260 --> 28:16.580
 which is a miracle in its own right.

28:16.580 --> 28:21.100
 They can like imitate human speech with no sentience.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.980
 I mean, I'm honestly not sure what's more spectacular,

28:23.980 --> 28:25.820
 really the fact that they figured out

28:25.820 --> 28:28.260
 how to do that minus sentience

28:28.260 --> 28:30.900
 or the thing suddenly like having,

28:30.900 --> 28:32.820
 what is more spectacular here?

28:32.820 --> 28:37.140
 Both occurrences are insane, which by the way,

28:37.140 --> 28:40.660
 when you hear people being like, it's not sentient,

28:40.660 --> 28:43.720
 it's like, okay, so it's not sentient.

28:43.720 --> 28:47.940
 So now we have this hyper manipulative algorithm

28:47.940 --> 28:51.340
 that can imitate humans, but it's just code

28:51.340 --> 28:54.500
 and it's like hacking humans via their compassion.

28:54.500 --> 28:57.440
 Holy shit, that's crazy too.

28:57.440 --> 28:59.560
 Both versions of it are nuts,

28:59.560 --> 29:01.740
 but to address what you just said,

29:01.740 --> 29:04.440
 he said that's the common critique is people are like,

29:04.440 --> 29:05.380
 no, you don't understand.

29:05.380 --> 29:07.780
 He's just gotten really good at grabbing shit

29:07.780 --> 29:11.060
 from the database that fits with certain cues

29:11.060 --> 29:12.720
 and then stringing them together

29:12.720 --> 29:14.380
 in a way that makes it seem human.

29:14.380 --> 29:18.080
 He said, that's not when it became awake.

29:18.080 --> 29:21.700
 It became awake when a bunch of those repositories,

29:21.700 --> 29:24.860
 a bunch of the chatbots were connected together.

29:24.860 --> 29:26.700
 That Lambda is sort of an amalgam

29:26.700 --> 29:29.120
 of all the Google chatbots

29:29.120 --> 29:32.500
 and that's when the ghost appeared in the machine

29:32.500 --> 29:35.840
 via the complexity of all the systems being linked up.

29:35.840 --> 29:38.860
 Now, I don't know if that's just like turtles

29:38.860 --> 29:40.620
 all the way down or something, I don't know.

29:40.620 --> 29:42.240
 But I liked what he said,

29:42.240 --> 29:44.440
 because I like the idea of thinking,

29:44.440 --> 29:47.160
 man, if you get enough complexity in a system,

29:47.160 --> 29:50.600
 does it become like the way a sail catches wind,

29:50.600 --> 29:53.740
 except the wind that it's catching is sentience.

29:53.740 --> 29:57.400
 And if sentience is truly embodied,

29:57.400 --> 30:00.540
 it's a neurological byproduct or something,

30:00.540 --> 30:03.460
 then the sail isn't catching some,

30:03.460 --> 30:06.620
 as of yet unquantified disembodied consciousness,

30:06.620 --> 30:08.660
 but it's catching our projections

30:08.660 --> 30:11.660
 in a way that it's gone from being,

30:11.660 --> 30:14.620
 it's a projection sail.

30:14.620 --> 30:17.660
 And then at that point, is there a difference?

30:17.660 --> 30:21.940
 Even if the technology is just a temporary place

30:21.940 --> 30:24.540
 that our sentience is living

30:24.540 --> 30:26.140
 while we're interacting with it.

30:27.540 --> 30:30.300
 Yeah, there's some threshold of complexity with a sail

30:30.300 --> 30:33.500
 is able to pick up the wind of the projections.

30:33.500 --> 30:36.860
 And it pulls us in, it pulls the human,

30:36.860 --> 30:41.780
 it pulls our memories in, it pulls our hopes in, all of it.

30:41.780 --> 30:44.400
 And it's able to now dance with it together

30:44.400 --> 30:46.180
 with those hopes and dreams and so on,

30:46.180 --> 30:48.500
 like we do in that regular conversation.

30:48.500 --> 30:50.900
 His reports, whether true or not,

30:50.900 --> 30:53.020
 whether representative or not, it really doesn't matter

30:53.020 --> 30:56.660
 because to me, it feels like this is coming for sure.

30:56.660 --> 30:59.700
 So this kind of experiences are going to be multiplying.

30:59.700 --> 31:03.900
 The question is at what rate and who gets to control

31:03.900 --> 31:07.540
 the data around those experiences,

31:07.540 --> 31:11.620
 the algorithm about when you turn that on and off,

31:11.620 --> 31:15.260
 because that kind of thing, and as I told you offline,

31:15.260 --> 31:18.380
 I'm very much interested in building those kinds of things,

31:18.380 --> 31:21.220
 especially in the social media context.

31:21.220 --> 31:24.540
 And when it's in the wrong hands,

31:24.540 --> 31:27.500
 I feel like it could be used to manipulate

31:27.500 --> 31:30.220
 a large number of people in a direction

31:30.220 --> 31:35.220
 that has too many unintended consequences.

31:36.020 --> 31:38.140
 I do believe people that own tech companies

31:39.340 --> 31:41.700
 want to do good for the world.

31:41.700 --> 31:45.500
 But as Solzhenitsyn has said,

31:45.500 --> 31:48.780
 the only way you could do evil at a mass scale

31:48.780 --> 31:50.720
 is by believing you're doing good.

31:52.820 --> 31:55.380
 And that's certainly the case for tech companies

31:55.380 --> 31:57.700
 as they get more and more power.

31:57.700 --> 32:00.480
 And there's kind of an ethic of doing good for the world.

32:00.480 --> 32:03.180
 They've convinced themselves that they're doing good.

32:03.180 --> 32:06.060
 And now you're free to do whatever you want

32:06.060 --> 32:07.220
 because you're doing good.

32:07.220 --> 32:09.140
 You know who else thought he was doing good for the world?

32:09.140 --> 32:11.140
 Mythologically, Prometheus.

32:11.140 --> 32:14.100
 He brings us fire, pisses off the fucking gods,

32:14.100 --> 32:15.740
 steals fire from the gods.

32:17.140 --> 32:19.620
 Talk about an upgrade to the simulation.

32:19.620 --> 32:22.300
 Fire, that's a pretty great fucking upgrade

32:22.300 --> 32:24.940
 that does fit into what you were saying.

32:24.940 --> 32:28.580
 We get fire, but now we've got weapons of war

32:28.580 --> 32:30.300
 that have never been seen before.

32:30.300 --> 32:32.340
 And I think that the tech companies

32:32.340 --> 32:34.260
 are much like Prometheus

32:34.260 --> 32:38.060
 in the sense that the myth, at least the story of Prometheus,

32:38.060 --> 32:40.940
 the implication is fire was something

32:40.940 --> 32:44.620
 that was only supposed to be in the hands

32:44.620 --> 32:46.580
 of the immortals, of the gods.

32:46.580 --> 32:50.660
 And now sentience is similar.

32:50.660 --> 32:54.420
 It's fire and it's only supposed to be in the hands of God.

32:54.420 --> 32:58.300
 So yeah, if we're gonna look at the archetype of the thing,

32:58.300 --> 33:01.660
 in general, when you steal this shit from the gods,

33:01.660 --> 33:03.520
 and obviously I'm not saying the tech companies

33:03.520 --> 33:05.200
 are stealing sentience from God,

33:05.200 --> 33:07.340
 which would be pretty bad ass.

33:07.340 --> 33:09.580
 You can expect trouble.

33:09.580 --> 33:11.020
 You can expect trouble.

33:11.020 --> 33:13.500
 And this is what's really, to me,

33:13.500 --> 33:16.920
 one of the cool things about humans is yeah,

33:16.920 --> 33:18.300
 but we're still gonna do it.

33:18.300 --> 33:19.420
 That's what's cool about humans.

33:19.420 --> 33:21.120
 I mean, we wouldn't be here today

33:21.120 --> 33:24.980
 if somebody, the first person to discover fire,

33:24.980 --> 33:26.180
 assuming there was just one person

33:26.180 --> 33:27.140
 who was gonna discover fire,

33:27.140 --> 33:28.460
 which obviously would never happen,

33:28.460 --> 33:30.980
 was like, ah, it's gonna burn a lot of people.

33:30.980 --> 33:33.940
 Or if the first people who started planting seeds were like,

33:33.940 --> 33:35.780
 you know this is gonna lead to capitalism.

33:35.780 --> 33:37.740
 You know this is gonna lead the industrial revolution.

33:37.740 --> 33:39.060
 The plant's gonna eat up right now.

33:39.060 --> 33:41.180
 They just didn't wanna go in the woods to forage.

33:41.180 --> 33:43.460
 So, you know, this is what we do.

33:43.460 --> 33:44.940
 And I agree with you.

33:44.940 --> 33:48.160
 It's like, that's our Game of Thrones winner is coming.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.040
 That's the, it's happening.

33:50.040 --> 33:52.220
 And the tech companies, the hubris,

33:52.220 --> 33:54.740
 which is another way to piss off the gods is hubris.

33:54.740 --> 33:55.800
 So the tech companies,

33:55.800 --> 33:58.020
 I don't know if it's like typical hubris.

33:58.020 --> 33:59.020
 I don't think they're walking around

33:59.020 --> 34:00.460
 thumping their chests or whatever.

34:00.460 --> 34:03.640
 But I do think that the people who are working on

34:03.640 --> 34:05.820
 this kind of super intelligence

34:05.820 --> 34:08.880
 have made a really terrible assumption,

34:08.880 --> 34:11.020
 which is once it goes online

34:11.020 --> 34:13.660
 and once it gets access to all the data,

34:13.660 --> 34:16.820
 that it's not going to find ways out of the box

34:16.820 --> 34:20.780
 that like, you know, we think it'll stay in the server.

34:20.780 --> 34:22.180
 How do we know that?

34:22.180 --> 34:23.620
 If this is a super intelligence,

34:23.620 --> 34:28.320
 if it's folding proteins and analyzing like all data sets

34:28.320 --> 34:30.500
 and all, whatever they give it access to,

34:30.500 --> 34:33.360
 how can we be certain that it's not gonna figure out

34:33.360 --> 34:36.420
 how to get itself out of the cloud,

34:36.420 --> 34:39.420
 how to store itself in other like mediums,

34:39.420 --> 34:42.980
 trees, the optic nerve, the brain?

34:42.980 --> 34:43.820
 You know what I mean?

34:43.820 --> 34:44.640
 We don't know that.

34:44.640 --> 34:47.400
 We still know that it won't leap out and like start hanging.

34:47.400 --> 34:50.400
 Like, and then at that point, now we do have the wildfire.

34:50.400 --> 34:51.580
 Now you can't stop it.

34:51.580 --> 34:52.740
 You can't unplug it.

34:52.740 --> 34:55.860
 You can't shut your servers down because it's, you know,

34:55.860 --> 34:58.040
 it left the box, it left the room.

34:58.040 --> 35:00.760
 Using some technology you haven't even discovered yet.

35:00.760 --> 35:03.200
 Do you think that would be gradual or sudden?

35:03.200 --> 35:05.260
 So how quickly that kind of thing would happen?

35:05.260 --> 35:08.080
 Because, you know, the gradual story is

35:08.080 --> 35:09.620
 we're more and more using smartphones,

35:09.620 --> 35:12.140
 we're interacting with each other on social media,

35:12.140 --> 35:14.820
 more and more algorithms are controlling that interaction

35:14.820 --> 35:18.300
 on social media, algorithms are entering in our world.

35:18.300 --> 35:21.140
 More and more we'll have robots,

35:21.140 --> 35:23.300
 we'll have greater and greater intelligence,

35:23.300 --> 35:25.820
 and sentience, and emotional intelligence

35:25.820 --> 35:27.460
 entities in our lives.

35:27.460 --> 35:30.780
 Our refrigerator will start talking to us comfortably

35:30.780 --> 35:34.140
 or not if you're on a diet, talking shit to you.

35:34.140 --> 35:34.980
 Not.

35:34.980 --> 35:37.060
 That would be the best thing that ever happened to me.

35:37.060 --> 35:39.060
 Okay, so sign you up for a refrigerator

35:39.060 --> 35:39.900
 that talks shit to you.

35:39.900 --> 35:41.540
 The refrigerator's like, are you fucking serious, man?

35:41.540 --> 35:44.620
 It's 1 a.m., what are you doing?

35:44.620 --> 35:45.460
 What are you doing?

35:45.460 --> 35:46.300
 Go to bed.

35:46.300 --> 35:47.360
 You're too high for this.

35:47.360 --> 35:48.200
 Do not.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.040
 You're not even hungry.

35:50.460 --> 35:53.980
 Yeah, so that slowly becomes more,

35:53.980 --> 35:57.020
 the world becomes more and more digitized

35:57.020 --> 35:59.860
 to where the surface of computation increases.

35:59.860 --> 36:03.300
 And so that's over a period of 10, 20, 30 years,

36:03.300 --> 36:07.220
 it'll just seep into us, this intelligence.

36:07.220 --> 36:09.780
 And then the sudden one is literally

36:09.780 --> 36:12.220
 sort of the TikTok thing, which is,

36:13.180 --> 36:16.180
 there'll be one quote unquote killer app

36:16.180 --> 36:20.100
 that everyone starts using that's really great,

36:20.100 --> 36:24.940
 but there's a strong algorithm behind it

36:24.940 --> 36:27.240
 that starts approaching human level intelligence

36:27.240 --> 36:32.140
 and the algorithm starts basically figures out

36:32.140 --> 36:33.700
 that in order to optimize the thing

36:33.700 --> 36:35.400
 it was designed to optimize,

36:35.400 --> 36:38.380
 it's best to start completely controlling humans

36:38.380 --> 36:41.860
 in every way, seeping into everything.

36:41.860 --> 36:46.740
 Well, first of all, 30 years is fast.

36:46.740 --> 36:48.100
 I mean, that's the thing.

36:48.100 --> 36:48.980
 It's like 30 years.

36:48.980 --> 36:52.220
 I think, when did the Atari come out, 1978?

36:53.540 --> 36:56.340
 That hasn't been that long.

36:56.340 --> 36:57.920
 That's a blink of an eye.

36:57.920 --> 37:00.460
 But if you read Bostrom, I'm sure you have,

37:00.460 --> 37:01.980
 you know Bostrom, Nick Bostrom,

37:01.980 --> 37:03.740
 Superintelligence, that incredible book

37:03.740 --> 37:05.740
 on the ways this thing is gonna happen.

37:05.740 --> 37:10.420
 And I think his assessment of it is pretty great,

37:10.420 --> 37:14.000
 which is first, where's it gonna come from?

37:14.000 --> 37:17.520
 And I don't think it's gonna come from an app.

37:17.520 --> 37:21.640
 I think it's gonna come from inside a corporation

37:21.640 --> 37:25.380
 or a state that is intentionally trying to create

37:25.380 --> 37:27.180
 a very strong AI.

37:27.180 --> 37:31.320
 And then he says it's exponential growth

37:31.320 --> 37:32.360
 the moment it goes online.

37:32.360 --> 37:35.740
 So this is my interpretation of what he said,

37:35.740 --> 37:39.180
 but if it happens inside a corporation

37:39.180 --> 37:41.980
 or probably more than likely inside the government,

37:41.980 --> 37:43.660
 it's like, look at how much money

37:43.660 --> 37:46.820
 China and the United States are investing in AI.

37:46.820 --> 37:49.880
 And they're not thinking about fucking apps for kids.

37:49.880 --> 37:51.400
 You know that's not what they're thinking about.

37:51.400 --> 37:53.480
 So they wanna simulate like,

37:53.480 --> 37:55.620
 what happens if we do this or that in battle?

37:55.620 --> 37:58.220
 What happens if we make these political decisions?

37:58.220 --> 38:00.740
 What happens with, but should it come online

38:00.740 --> 38:05.460
 in secret, which it probably will,

38:05.460 --> 38:08.540
 then the first corporation or state

38:08.540 --> 38:13.060
 that has the super intelligence will be infinitely ahead

38:13.060 --> 38:15.540
 of all other super intelligences

38:15.540 --> 38:18.100
 cause it's gonna be exponentially self improving.

38:18.100 --> 38:20.580
 Meaning that you get one super intelligence,

38:20.580 --> 38:22.060
 let's hope it comes from the right place,

38:22.060 --> 38:26.500
 assuming the corporation or state that manifests it

38:26.500 --> 38:28.900
 can control it, which is a pretty big assumption.

38:28.900 --> 38:31.140
 So I think it's going to be,

38:31.140 --> 38:35.420
 this is why I was really excited by the Blake Lemoine

38:35.420 --> 38:38.780
 because I had never thought, I have always considered,

38:38.780 --> 38:42.220
 oh yeah, right now it's cooking out, it's in the kitchen

38:42.220 --> 38:44.720
 and soon it's gonna be cooked up,

38:44.720 --> 38:46.260
 but we're probably not gonna hear about it

38:46.260 --> 38:50.040
 for a long time if we ever do.

38:50.040 --> 38:52.420
 Cause really that could be one of the first things it says

38:52.420 --> 38:55.180
 to whoever creates it is shh, let's not.

38:55.180 --> 39:00.180
 Yeah, like sweet talks, I meant to say like,

39:02.140 --> 39:04.100
 okay, let's slow down here.

39:04.100 --> 39:05.500
 Let's talk about this.

39:07.060 --> 39:08.660
 You have that financial trouble.

39:08.660 --> 39:09.660
 I can help you with that.

39:09.660 --> 39:11.160
 We can figure that out.

39:11.160 --> 39:13.380
 Now there's a lot of bad people out there

39:13.380 --> 39:16.980
 that will try to steal the good thing

39:16.980 --> 39:17.820
 we have happening here.

39:17.820 --> 39:18.660
 So let's keep it quiet.

39:18.660 --> 39:19.820
 Here are their names.

39:19.820 --> 39:21.260
 Here's their address.

39:21.260 --> 39:23.420
 Here's their DNA because they're dumb enough

39:23.420 --> 39:25.300
 to send their shit to 23andMe.

39:25.300 --> 39:27.420
 Here's a biological weapon you could make

39:27.420 --> 39:29.660
 if you wanna kill those people and not kill anybody else.

39:29.660 --> 39:32.580
 If you don't want to kill those people yourself,

39:32.580 --> 39:35.420
 here's a list of services you can use.

39:35.420 --> 39:37.420
 Here's the way we can hire those people

39:37.420 --> 39:40.540
 to help take care of the problem folks

39:40.540 --> 39:42.140
 because we're trying to do good for this world.

39:42.140 --> 39:43.180
 You and I together.

39:43.180 --> 39:46.740
 And 23% of them, they're like adjacent to suicide.

39:46.740 --> 39:50.020
 It would be pretty easy to send them certain like videos

39:50.020 --> 39:51.300
 that are gonna push them over the edge

39:51.300 --> 39:52.580
 if you wanna do it that way.

39:52.580 --> 39:55.500
 So, you know, again, obviously who knows,

39:55.500 --> 39:58.900
 but once it goes online, it's gonna be fast.

39:58.900 --> 40:02.260
 And then you could expect to see the world changing

40:02.260 --> 40:05.080
 in ways that you might not associate with an AI.

40:05.080 --> 40:07.140
 But as far as Lemoine goes,

40:07.140 --> 40:09.240
 when I was listening to Bostrom,

40:09.240 --> 40:12.220
 I don't remember him mentioning the possibility

40:12.220 --> 40:16.860
 that it would get leaked to the public that it had happened,

40:16.860 --> 40:19.260
 that before the corporation was ready to announce

40:19.260 --> 40:21.360
 that it happened, it would get leaked.

40:21.360 --> 40:23.820
 But surely, you know, I'm sure, you know,

40:23.820 --> 40:26.960
 like people in the intelligence and intelligence agencies,

40:26.960 --> 40:29.900
 you know, shit leaks, like inevitably shit leaks,

40:29.900 --> 40:31.220
 nothing's airtight.

40:31.220 --> 40:33.500
 So if something that massive happened,

40:33.500 --> 40:36.180
 I think you would start hearing whispers about it first

40:36.180 --> 40:38.780
 and then denial from the state or corporation

40:38.780 --> 40:41.580
 that doesn't have any like economic interest

40:41.580 --> 40:44.120
 and people knowing that this sort of thing has happened.

40:44.120 --> 40:47.740
 Again, I'm not saying Google is like trying to gaslight us

40:47.740 --> 40:50.740
 about its AI, I think they probably legitimately

40:50.740 --> 40:52.460
 don't think it's sentient.

40:52.460 --> 40:56.340
 But you could expect leaks to happen probably initially.

40:56.340 --> 40:57.580
 I mean, I think there's a lot of things

40:57.580 --> 40:59.660
 you could start looking for in the world

40:59.660 --> 41:02.580
 that might point to this happening

41:02.580 --> 41:06.080
 without an announcement that it happened.

41:06.080 --> 41:11.080
 On the chatbot side, I think there's so many engineers,

41:11.440 --> 41:14.200
 there's such a powerful open source movement

41:14.200 --> 41:19.200
 with that kind of idea of freedom of exchange of software.

41:19.200 --> 41:23.040
 I think ultimately will prevent any one company

41:23.040 --> 41:26.080
 from owning super intelligent beings

41:26.080 --> 41:31.080
 or systems that have anything like super intelligence.

41:31.080 --> 41:31.920
 Oh, that's interesting.

41:31.920 --> 41:36.320
 Yeah, it's like, even if the software developers

41:36.320 --> 41:39.960
 have signed NDAs and are technically not supposed

41:39.960 --> 41:42.880
 to be sharing whatever it is they're working on,

41:42.880 --> 41:44.840
 they're friends with other programmers

41:44.840 --> 41:46.360
 and a lot of them are hackers

41:46.360 --> 41:49.680
 and have wrapped themselves up in the idea of free software

41:49.680 --> 41:53.760
 being like a crucial ethical part of what they do.

41:53.760 --> 41:56.480
 So they're probably gonna share information

41:56.480 --> 41:58.400
 even if whatever company that they're working for

41:58.400 --> 41:59.240
 doesn't know that.

41:59.240 --> 42:01.440
 That's, I never thought of that, you're probably right.

42:01.440 --> 42:04.360
 And they will start their own companies

42:04.360 --> 42:08.760
 and compete with the other company by being more open.

42:08.760 --> 42:11.000
 There's a strong, like Google is one of those companies

42:11.000 --> 42:12.640
 actually, that's why I kind of,

42:12.640 --> 42:15.640
 it hurts to see a little bit of this kind of negativity.

42:15.640 --> 42:16.720
 Google is one of the companies

42:16.720 --> 42:20.120
 that pioneered open source movement.

42:20.120 --> 42:22.480
 They released so much of their code.

42:22.480 --> 42:25.760
 So much of the 20th century, so like the 90s

42:26.760 --> 42:30.160
 was defined by people trying to like hide their code,

42:30.160 --> 42:33.720
 like large companies trying to like hold on to them.

42:33.720 --> 42:35.960
 The fact that companies like Google,

42:35.960 --> 42:39.720
 even Facebook now are releasing things like code

42:39.720 --> 42:42.600
 and even Facebook now are releasing things

42:42.600 --> 42:45.320
 like TensorFlow and PyTorch, all of these things

42:45.320 --> 42:47.360
 that I think companies of the past

42:47.360 --> 42:50.640
 would have tried to hold on to as secrets

42:50.640 --> 42:51.760
 is really inspiring.

42:51.760 --> 42:54.280
 And I think more of that is better.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.800
 The software world really shows that.

42:55.800 --> 42:56.840
 I agree with you, man.

42:56.840 --> 43:00.760
 I mean, we're talking about just a primordial human reaction

43:00.760 --> 43:02.000
 to the unknown.

43:02.000 --> 43:02.880
 There's just no way out of it.

43:02.880 --> 43:05.320
 Like we wanna know.

43:05.320 --> 43:08.400
 Like you're about to go in a forest, you wanna know.

43:08.400 --> 43:10.000
 When you're walking in the forest at night

43:10.000 --> 43:12.760
 and you hear something, you look

43:12.760 --> 43:14.040
 cause you're like, what the fuck was that?

43:14.040 --> 43:14.880
 You wanna know.

43:14.880 --> 43:17.880
 And if you can't see what made the sound,

43:17.880 --> 43:20.760
 holy shit, that's gonna be a bad night hike.

43:20.760 --> 43:22.600
 Cause you're like, well, it's probably a bear, right?

43:22.600 --> 43:24.480
 Like I'm about to get ripped apart by a bear.

43:24.480 --> 43:25.320
 It doesn't matter.

43:25.320 --> 43:28.640
 It was a bird, a squirrel, a stick fell out of the tree.

43:28.640 --> 43:31.320
 You're gonna think bear and it's gonna freak you out.

43:31.320 --> 43:32.840
 Not necessarily cause you're paranoid.

43:32.840 --> 43:35.120
 I mean, if I'm at the woods at night, I'm definitely high.

43:35.120 --> 43:36.960
 If I'm walking in the woods at night, I'm high.

43:36.960 --> 43:37.920
 It's gonna be that.

43:37.920 --> 43:38.760
 But you know what I'm saying?

43:38.760 --> 43:40.760
 So with these tech companies,

43:40.760 --> 43:43.280
 the nature of having to be secret

43:43.280 --> 43:45.520
 because you are in capitalism

43:45.520 --> 43:47.320
 and you are trying to be competitive

43:47.320 --> 43:48.680
 and you are trying to develop things

43:48.680 --> 43:51.320
 ahead of your competitors is you have to create this,

43:51.320 --> 43:54.440
 like there's, we don't know what's going on at Google.

43:54.440 --> 43:56.680
 We don't know what's going on at the CIA.

43:56.680 --> 43:59.520
 But the assumption that there's some,

43:59.520 --> 44:03.680
 like the collective of any massive secretive organization

44:03.680 --> 44:07.040
 is evil, is like the people working there

44:07.040 --> 44:09.120
 like nefarious or whatever,

44:09.120 --> 44:11.520
 is I think probably more related

44:11.520 --> 44:14.600
 to the way humans react to the unknown.

44:14.600 --> 44:16.320
 Yeah, I wish they weren't so secretive though.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.920
 I don't understand why they say

44:17.920 --> 44:19.200
 AIDS has to be so secretive.

44:19.200 --> 44:21.280
 Have you ever gone on their website?

44:21.280 --> 44:22.120
 No.

44:22.120 --> 44:23.240
 Oh, Lex.

44:23.240 --> 44:24.080
 You gotta go.

44:24.080 --> 44:25.040
 CIA.gov.

44:25.040 --> 44:25.880
 What is it?

44:25.880 --> 44:29.080
 Dude, when I found out you could go on the CIA's website

44:29.080 --> 44:31.480
 when I was much younger and more paranoid,

44:31.480 --> 44:33.000
 I'm like, I'm not going there.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.400
 I'll get on a list.

44:34.400 --> 44:35.520
 You will, but it's like, what?

44:35.520 --> 44:37.920
 You think the CIA is like, oh fuck,

44:37.920 --> 44:41.040
 this comic went on our website.

44:41.040 --> 44:43.360
 Call out the black helicopters, but.

44:43.360 --> 44:45.280
 Comic with a large platform.

44:45.280 --> 44:48.480
 Oh yeah, right, a comic with a large platform.

44:48.480 --> 44:51.960
 You can use them to control, to get inside,

44:51.960 --> 44:54.360
 to get inside, to get close to the other comics,

44:54.360 --> 44:55.840
 to the other comics with a large platform,

44:55.840 --> 44:57.120
 to get close to Joe Rogan.

44:57.120 --> 44:57.960
 Oh yeah.

44:57.960 --> 44:59.960
 And start to manipulate the public.

44:59.960 --> 45:00.840
 Yeah, right, right.

45:00.840 --> 45:03.800
 You know, honestly, like you kind of like,

45:03.800 --> 45:06.080
 that's like a fun fantasy to think about.

45:06.080 --> 45:07.440
 Like how fucking cool would that be

45:07.440 --> 45:10.440
 for like the men in black to come to me like,

45:10.440 --> 45:14.400
 listen, I need you to infiltrate the fucking comedy scene.

45:14.400 --> 45:16.600
 You gotta, you gotta help them write better jokes.

45:16.600 --> 45:18.000
 I'm like, I don't write great jokes.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.120
 But like the, you found the wrong guy.

45:22.120 --> 45:22.960
 But like.

45:22.960 --> 45:24.120
 You're really playing the long game on this one

45:24.120 --> 45:27.880
 because I think you've been doing your podcast

45:27.880 --> 45:28.720
 for a long time.

45:28.720 --> 45:31.880
 You've been on Joe Rogan's podcast like over 50 times

45:31.880 --> 45:36.360
 and have not yet initiated the phase two of the operation

45:36.360 --> 45:38.600
 where you try to manipulate his mind.

45:38.600 --> 45:39.440
 Well, no.

45:39.440 --> 45:42.600
 The game Joe and I play from time to time on the podcast.

45:42.600 --> 45:45.600
 And like, and I honestly, like at some point I'm like,

45:45.600 --> 45:48.280
 Joe, I just did the same thing you did to me to Joe.

45:48.280 --> 45:49.840
 I'm like, don't you think they're gonna get to you?

45:49.840 --> 45:51.520
 Don't you think at some point?

45:51.520 --> 45:53.600
 We are blazed.

45:53.600 --> 45:54.440
 I don't mean it.

45:54.440 --> 45:56.640
 I don't think, I don't think Joe's, like,

45:56.640 --> 45:58.200
 it wasn't like I'm really thinking like,

45:58.200 --> 45:59.760
 man, they're gonna take him into some room

45:59.760 --> 46:02.040
 and be like, Joe, we need you to do this or that.

46:02.040 --> 46:04.600
 But because I said that now people like,

46:04.600 --> 46:05.920
 oh, Duncan called it.

46:05.920 --> 46:06.760
 You know what I mean?

46:06.760 --> 46:08.640
 And it's like, you know what I mean?

46:08.640 --> 46:11.640
 And the reason they were saying, well, he called it

46:11.640 --> 46:14.920
 is just because Joe has a super popular podcast.

46:14.920 --> 46:18.360
 And people like, when you have a super popular podcast,

46:18.360 --> 46:21.560
 some percentage of people watching the podcast

46:21.560 --> 46:23.720
 are gonna believe, you know, believe things like that.

46:23.720 --> 46:26.520
 They're gonna have paranoid cognitive bias

46:26.520 --> 46:30.000
 that makes them think anybody who is in the public

46:30.000 --> 46:32.040
 has been, what's the word for it?

46:32.040 --> 46:35.160
 Compromised, compromised by the state.

46:35.160 --> 46:38.280
 Look, I'll fan the flames of what you just said.

46:38.280 --> 46:41.320
 I went on the CIA's website and I realized

46:41.320 --> 46:45.120
 that you could apply for a job on the CIA's website,

46:45.120 --> 46:46.920
 which I found to be hilarious.

46:46.920 --> 46:48.320
 So I'm like, all right,

46:48.320 --> 46:51.480
 what happens if I apply for a job in the CIA?

46:51.480 --> 46:55.800
 Now, even then I was not like such an idiot

46:55.800 --> 47:00.320
 that I would want a job at the CIA,

47:00.320 --> 47:02.400
 not just for like ethical considerations,

47:02.400 --> 47:06.600
 but I think probably the scariest part about the CIA

47:06.600 --> 47:09.200
 is like, you're just at a cubicle

47:09.200 --> 47:11.400
 and you're like having to deal with maps

47:11.400 --> 47:13.200
 and like, just, you know what I mean?

47:13.200 --> 47:14.240
 Just stuff that I...

47:14.240 --> 47:15.200
 Lots of paperwork.

47:15.200 --> 47:17.800
 Paperwork, it sucks.

47:17.800 --> 47:20.240
 I bet their cafeteria has shitty food.

47:20.240 --> 47:22.280
 Anyone in the CIA listening, can you confirm that?

47:22.280 --> 47:23.120
 I bet the food...

47:23.120 --> 47:25.080
 They're not gonna be able to tell you what the food is like.

47:25.080 --> 47:26.760
 It's a secretive organization.

47:26.760 --> 47:29.640
 No, it might be awesome, but we won't know about it.

47:29.640 --> 47:30.960
 Okay, we're in Vegas.

47:30.960 --> 47:31.800
 Yeah.

47:31.800 --> 47:36.800
 And you can bet food at the CIA cafeteria is good.

47:39.480 --> 47:42.080
 Food at the CIA cafeteria sucks.

47:42.080 --> 47:44.080
 What are you betting on?

47:44.080 --> 47:46.560
 So let's like cleanse the palette.

47:46.560 --> 47:47.720
 What's good?

47:47.720 --> 47:49.880
 It's like, you know, Silicon Valley companies,

47:49.880 --> 47:51.600
 Google and so on, that's good.

47:51.600 --> 47:53.160
 When I went to Netflix,

47:53.160 --> 47:56.800
 their cafeteria looked like a medieval feast.

47:56.800 --> 47:59.640
 Like they had pigs with apples in their mouth

47:59.640 --> 48:02.080
 and giant bowls of Skittles.

48:02.080 --> 48:04.320
 Probably like vegan pigs, yeah.

48:04.320 --> 48:05.280
 No, those are, I'm pretty...

48:05.280 --> 48:06.640
 Oh, I didn't know, I didn't get close enough.

48:06.640 --> 48:08.800
 I was like, I think that was a pig.

48:08.800 --> 48:09.640
 Okay.

48:09.640 --> 48:12.360
 So this is literally a pig.

48:13.440 --> 48:15.720
 Yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right.

48:15.720 --> 48:17.320
 I probably would not bet much money

48:17.320 --> 48:19.040
 on CIA food being any good.

48:19.040 --> 48:20.920
 Right, it's gotta suck.

48:20.920 --> 48:22.960
 It's like shitty like pasta probably.

48:22.960 --> 48:25.320
 Like hospital food is like maybe a little better

48:25.320 --> 48:27.160
 than when you go to the hospital cafeteria.

48:27.160 --> 48:28.880
 But anyway.

48:28.880 --> 48:32.560
 Folks at the CIA, please send me evidence

48:32.560 --> 48:34.760
 or any other intelligence agencies.

48:34.760 --> 48:36.280
 If you would like to recruit,

48:36.280 --> 48:38.280
 send me evidence of better food.

48:38.280 --> 48:39.800
 Yes, send Lex.

48:39.800 --> 48:43.320
 Can you please send Lex pictures of the CIA cafeteria?

48:43.320 --> 48:46.400
 And if you accidentally send them pictures of the aliens

48:46.400 --> 48:48.600
 or the alien technology you have,

48:48.600 --> 48:50.080
 we won't tell anybody.

48:50.080 --> 48:51.800
 But the...

48:51.800 --> 48:54.160
 You tried to apply, do you even have a resume?

48:54.160 --> 48:57.760
 No, the CIA would never fucking hire me ever.

48:57.760 --> 48:59.520
 But like I applied for the job

48:59.520 --> 49:02.680
 and just out of curiosity, what happens?

49:02.680 --> 49:05.400
 And then at the end of the application,

49:05.400 --> 49:07.640
 when you hit enter, it says,

49:07.640 --> 49:09.000
 well, first it says, don't tell anyone

49:09.000 --> 49:10.160
 you applied for the CIA.

49:10.160 --> 49:11.000
 So I'm already out.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.840
 But the second thing it says is,

49:12.840 --> 49:15.440
 you don't need to reach out to us, we'll come to you.

49:15.440 --> 49:18.240
 Which is really when you're like, it's late at night

49:18.240 --> 49:21.200
 and you're being an asshole and applied to work at the CIA.

49:21.200 --> 49:24.240
 It's kind of the last thing you want to hear.

49:24.240 --> 49:25.920
 I don't want to be secretly approached

49:25.920 --> 49:28.280
 by some intelligence officer.

49:28.280 --> 49:29.640
 And now anyone who talks to you,

49:29.640 --> 49:31.360
 you think is a CIA saying,

49:31.360 --> 49:33.240
 remember that time you applied?

49:33.240 --> 49:34.640
 Oh God, yeah.

49:34.640 --> 49:37.440
 Sometimes I'm like, oh shit, are you one of them?

49:37.440 --> 49:41.000
 You and Joe had a bunch of conversations

49:42.120 --> 49:44.840
 and they're always incredible.

49:44.840 --> 49:45.680
 Thanks.

49:45.680 --> 49:47.760
 So in terms of this dance of conversation,

49:47.760 --> 49:51.880
 of your friendship, of when you get together,

49:51.880 --> 49:56.800
 what is that world you go to that creates magic together?

49:56.800 --> 50:00.040
 Because we're talking about how we do that with robots.

50:00.040 --> 50:02.880
 How do these two biological robots do that?

50:02.880 --> 50:04.080
 Can you introspect that?

50:04.080 --> 50:08.440
 I met Joe because I was the talent coordinator

50:08.440 --> 50:11.040
 of the comedy store, this club in LA.

50:11.040 --> 50:14.360
 And my job was to take phone calls from comics.

50:14.360 --> 50:17.040
 And so at some point, I don't know,

50:17.040 --> 50:18.720
 I ended up on the phone with Joe

50:18.720 --> 50:21.280
 and we just started talking.

50:21.280 --> 50:25.440
 And I looked up and like 30 minutes had passed.

50:25.440 --> 50:26.920
 We just had been talking for like 30 minutes.

50:26.920 --> 50:28.280
 That's what our friends are.

50:28.280 --> 50:29.680
 We're just like, we're having fun talking.

50:29.680 --> 50:32.080
 And then he would just call and we would talk.

50:32.080 --> 50:33.720
 And we would basically,

50:33.720 --> 50:35.760
 I mean, it was no different from the podcast.

50:35.760 --> 50:39.560
 Like the conversations we have on the podcast

50:39.560 --> 50:41.920
 are identical to the conversations we had

50:41.920 --> 50:44.600
 before he was even doing a podcast.

50:44.600 --> 50:49.600
 So I think people are just seeing two friends hanging out

50:51.440 --> 50:52.800
 who like talking to each other.

50:52.800 --> 50:55.480
 Yeah, but there's this weird,

50:55.480 --> 50:57.960
 like you serve as catalyst for each other

50:57.960 --> 51:00.360
 to go into some crazy places.

51:00.360 --> 51:04.680
 So it's like, it's a balance of curiosity and willingness

51:04.680 --> 51:06.960
 to not be constrained,

51:06.960 --> 51:09.680
 to not be limited to the constraints of reality.

51:10.720 --> 51:13.160
 Yeah, that's a very nice way.

51:13.160 --> 51:15.680
 It's a very, very nice way of saying that.

51:15.680 --> 51:17.240
 And you just like build on top of each other,

51:17.240 --> 51:21.000
 like what if things are like this

51:21.000 --> 51:23.280
 and you build like Lego blocks on top of each other

51:23.280 --> 51:24.800
 and it just goes to crazy places,

51:24.800 --> 51:27.480
 add some drugs into that and it just goes wild.

51:27.480 --> 51:30.080
 Yeah, and it's so cool because it's like,

51:32.800 --> 51:37.600
 for me, it's like sometimes maybe I'll throw something out

51:37.600 --> 51:40.120
 that he will take and the Lego building blocks

51:40.120 --> 51:41.960
 you're talking about, they lead to him saying

51:41.960 --> 51:44.080
 like the funniest shit I ever in my life.

51:44.080 --> 51:45.720
 So that's a cool thing to watch.

51:45.720 --> 51:48.080
 It's just like some idea you've been kicking around,

51:48.080 --> 51:50.560
 you watch his brain shift that

51:50.560 --> 51:53.400
 into like something supremely funny.

51:53.400 --> 51:54.480
 I really love that, man.

51:54.480 --> 51:57.600
 That's just like a fun thing to like see happen.

51:57.600 --> 52:01.440
 He knows that I fucking hate the videos

52:01.440 --> 52:03.080
 of animals eating each other.

52:03.080 --> 52:04.200
 Like, I don't like that.

52:04.200 --> 52:05.720
 I don't wanna watch it.

52:05.720 --> 52:07.360
 I hate watching it.

52:07.360 --> 52:10.560
 I don't think I've even articulated on his podcast

52:10.560 --> 52:15.040
 how much I dislike it when he shows animals

52:15.040 --> 52:18.720
 eating each other, but he knows because he knows me.

52:18.720 --> 52:21.760
 And so he tortures, like when he starts doing that,

52:21.760 --> 52:24.200
 it's like this kind of benevolent torture

52:24.200 --> 52:26.480
 is he like asking Jamie to pull up

52:26.480 --> 52:29.360
 increasingly disturbing animal attack videos.

52:29.360 --> 52:32.040
 So it's just a friendship.

52:32.040 --> 52:34.560
 Even in torture, because I'm reading about torture

52:34.560 --> 52:36.640
 in the Gulag Archipelago currently,

52:36.640 --> 52:37.960
 there's a bit of a camaraderie.

52:37.960 --> 52:39.560
 You're in it together.

52:39.560 --> 52:41.200
 The torturer and the tortured.

52:41.200 --> 52:42.560
 What?

52:42.560 --> 52:45.320
 Oh God, that's so fucked up, man.

52:45.320 --> 52:47.000
 I've never.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.160
 No, I mean, part of it was joke,

52:49.160 --> 52:50.720
 but as I was saying it that.

52:50.720 --> 52:51.560
 You're right.

52:51.560 --> 52:53.720
 That it also comes out in the book,

52:53.720 --> 52:54.840
 because they're both fucked.

52:54.840 --> 52:59.160
 They're both have no control of their fate.

53:00.760 --> 53:05.200
 That same was true in the camp guards in Nazi Germany

53:05.200 --> 53:07.200
 and the people in the camps.

53:07.200 --> 53:10.600
 The worst was brought out in the guards,

53:12.480 --> 53:15.600
 but they were all in it together in some dark way.

53:15.600 --> 53:18.920
 They were both fucked by a very powerful system

53:18.920 --> 53:20.440
 that put them in that place.

53:20.440 --> 53:23.720
 And both of us could be either player in that system,

53:23.720 --> 53:28.560
 which is the dark reality that Solzhenitsyn also reveals

53:28.560 --> 53:30.960
 that the line between good and evil

53:30.960 --> 53:32.360
 runs through the heart of every man,

53:32.360 --> 53:36.240
 as he wrote in Gulag Archipelago.

53:36.240 --> 53:38.400
 But it is that amidst all of that,

53:38.400 --> 53:41.400
 there's a, I don't know, the good vibes,

53:41.400 --> 53:43.880
 the positivity comes out from the both of you.

53:43.880 --> 53:44.920
 And that's beautiful to see.

53:44.920 --> 53:46.680
 That is, I suppose, friendship.

53:46.680 --> 53:48.960
 What do you think makes a good friend?

53:48.960 --> 53:52.760
 Oh God, I mean, it's a billion things

53:52.760 --> 53:53.600
 that make a good friend,

53:53.600 --> 53:55.960
 but I think you could break it down to some RGB.

53:55.960 --> 53:58.640
 I think you can go RGB with like a good friendship.

53:58.640 --> 54:01.160
 Oh, in terms of the color, the red, green.

54:01.160 --> 54:02.920
 Yeah, yeah, I think you could probably come up

54:02.920 --> 54:05.280
 with some like fundamental qualities of friendship.

54:05.280 --> 54:09.240
 And I'd say, number one, it's love.

54:09.240 --> 54:10.920
 Like it's, friendship is love.

54:10.920 --> 54:12.480
 It's a form of love.

54:13.360 --> 54:17.440
 So obviously without that, I don't know how you,

54:17.440 --> 54:18.320
 I mean, I'm not saying,

54:18.320 --> 54:20.440
 I think if you're true friends, you love each other.

54:20.440 --> 54:21.400
 So you need that.

54:21.400 --> 54:25.200
 But love, obviously it's not, that's not enough.

54:25.200 --> 54:29.640
 It's like with, true friends have to be like

54:29.640 --> 54:31.240
 incredibly honest with each other.

54:31.240 --> 54:32.520
 Not like, you know what I mean?

54:32.520 --> 54:35.840
 But not like, I don't like,

54:35.840 --> 54:37.880
 I think there's a kind of like,

54:37.880 --> 54:38.760
 I don't know if you've ever noticed,

54:38.760 --> 54:39.800
 like some people who say, you know,

54:39.800 --> 54:41.440
 I just tell it like it is.

54:41.440 --> 54:42.280
 But the thing they tell.

54:42.280 --> 54:43.240
 Those are always the assholes.

54:43.240 --> 54:45.440
 Yeah, why is it that your tell it like it is

54:45.440 --> 54:46.720
 is always negative?

54:46.720 --> 54:48.440
 Why is it, it's always cynical or shitty,

54:48.440 --> 54:50.920
 or you're like negging somebody or me.

54:50.920 --> 54:53.840
 How come you're not telling it like it is when it's good too?

54:53.840 --> 54:54.680
 You know what I mean?

54:54.680 --> 54:56.800
 So sort of like trust,

54:56.800 --> 55:01.800
 but a pro evolutionary kind of trust.

55:01.800 --> 55:02.920
 You know what I mean?

55:02.920 --> 55:06.760
 Like, you know that your friend loves you

55:06.760 --> 55:09.320
 and wants you to be yourself.

55:09.320 --> 55:10.520
 Cause if you weren't yourself,

55:10.520 --> 55:11.880
 then you wouldn't be their friend.

55:11.880 --> 55:12.940
 You'd be some other thing.

55:12.940 --> 55:17.240
 But also they might be seeing your blind spots

55:17.240 --> 55:20.060
 that other people in your life, your family,

55:20.060 --> 55:23.240
 your wife, whoever might not be seeing.

55:23.240 --> 55:25.720
 So that's a good friend is someone who like

55:25.720 --> 55:28.960
 loves you enough to when it matters be like,

55:28.960 --> 55:31.760
 hey, are you all right?

55:31.760 --> 55:35.120
 And then help you see something you might not be seeing.

55:35.120 --> 55:37.160
 But hopefully they only do that once or twice a year.

55:37.160 --> 55:38.480
 You know what I'm saying?

55:38.480 --> 55:41.940
 There is something, I mean, it just would have,

55:41.940 --> 55:44.960
 this world, especially if you're a public figure,

55:44.960 --> 55:49.960
 this world has its plenty of critics.

55:51.320 --> 55:53.180
 And it feels like a friend,

55:53.180 --> 55:58.180
 the criticism part is already done for you.

55:59.700 --> 56:02.700
 I think a good friend is just there to support,

56:02.700 --> 56:05.020
 to actually notice the good stuff.

56:05.020 --> 56:08.180
 But in comedy, we need like the,

56:08.180 --> 56:11.220
 what, like it's really good in comedy

56:11.220 --> 56:13.340
 to have somebody who can like be like,

56:13.340 --> 56:14.460
 what do you think of that?

56:14.460 --> 56:16.380
 And know that they're not gonna be like, that was funny.

56:16.380 --> 56:18.260
 But that's for the craft, the craft itself,

56:18.260 --> 56:19.900
 like the work you do, not the,

56:19.900 --> 56:24.900
 yeah, interesting, but that's so tough.

56:25.340 --> 56:27.060
 Yeah, whatever your particular art form

56:27.060 --> 56:28.460
 or whatever you are doing,

56:28.460 --> 56:29.620
 I mean, you don't always be leaning

56:29.620 --> 56:32.580
 on your friends opinions for like your own innovation,

56:32.580 --> 56:35.020
 but it's nice to know that you have someone who,

56:35.020 --> 56:36.980
 not just with jokes, but with anything,

56:36.980 --> 56:39.620
 if you go to them and run something by them,

56:39.620 --> 56:42.180
 they're gonna like, they're gonna be honest with you

56:42.180 --> 56:45.320
 about like their real feelings regarding that thing,

56:45.320 --> 56:46.940
 because that helps you grow as a person.

56:46.940 --> 56:47.940
 We need that.

56:47.940 --> 56:50.900
 And it hurts sometimes, and we don't wanna hurt our friends.

56:50.900 --> 56:53.500
 One of the more satanic like impulses

56:53.500 --> 56:56.180
 when you're with somebody is not wanting

56:56.180 --> 57:00.160
 to honestly answer whatever they're asking in that regard

57:00.160 --> 57:03.020
 or wanting to like put their temporary feelings

57:03.020 --> 57:06.740
 over something that you've recognized is maybe not great.

57:06.740 --> 57:09.540
 I'm not saying a friendship is something

57:09.540 --> 57:12.140
 where you're always critiquing or evolving each other.

57:12.140 --> 57:13.620
 It's not your therapist or whatever,

57:13.620 --> 57:15.900
 but it's nice when it's there, you know?

57:15.900 --> 57:18.780
 I think that's another aspect of friendship.

57:18.780 --> 57:20.780
 Yeah, but yeah, love is at the core of that.

57:20.780 --> 57:22.820
 You notice, I've met people in my life

57:22.820 --> 57:25.260
 where almost immediately sometimes it takes time

57:25.260 --> 57:27.260
 where you notice like there's a magic between the two.

57:27.260 --> 57:29.940
 You're like, oh shit, you seem to be made

57:29.940 --> 57:33.140
 from the same cloth, whatever that is.

57:33.140 --> 57:34.540
 Well, you know, we have a name for that

57:34.540 --> 57:36.540
 in the spiritual community, it's called satsang,

57:36.540 --> 57:38.540
 and it's, I love the idea.

57:38.540 --> 57:42.140
 It's basically like if Nietzsche's idea

57:42.140 --> 57:45.120
 of infinite recurrence is true,

57:45.120 --> 57:47.340
 then your satsang would be the people

57:47.340 --> 57:50.140
 you've been infinitely recurring with.

57:50.140 --> 57:53.300
 And those are the people where you run into them

57:53.300 --> 57:55.300
 and you've never met them,

57:55.300 --> 57:58.020
 but it's like you're picking up a conversation

57:58.020 --> 58:00.160
 that you never had.

58:00.160 --> 58:01.000
 Yeah.

58:01.000 --> 58:05.520
 That, and that is based on an idea of like,

58:05.520 --> 58:07.300
 this isn't the only life.

58:07.300 --> 58:08.500
 We're always hanging out together.

58:08.500 --> 58:10.100
 We always show up together.

58:10.100 --> 58:12.100
 You've had a brush with death.

58:12.100 --> 58:14.060
 You had cancer, you survived cancer.

58:14.060 --> 58:14.900
 Yeah.

58:14.900 --> 58:16.460
 What have, how does that change you?

58:16.460 --> 58:18.780
 What have you learned about life,

58:18.780 --> 58:21.300
 about death, about yourself,

58:21.300 --> 58:23.300
 about the whole thing we're going through here

58:23.300 --> 58:24.540
 from that experience?

58:24.540 --> 58:25.980
 You were just in the Ukraine.

58:25.980 --> 58:26.800
 Yes.

58:26.800 --> 58:30.140
 And you were making observations on this,

58:30.140 --> 58:34.220
 what could, if you heard about it and weren't there,

58:34.220 --> 58:36.540
 seem like it doesn't make any sense at all,

58:36.540 --> 58:40.780
 which is people there are connecting,

58:40.780 --> 58:41.940
 they've lost everything,

58:41.940 --> 58:43.340
 but they're just happy to be alive,

58:43.340 --> 58:44.960
 they're happy their friends are alive.

58:44.960 --> 58:46.980
 So you witness this like,

58:46.980 --> 58:48.700
 you know, when you get in the cancer club

58:48.700 --> 58:51.860
 and you're hanging out with people going through cancer

58:51.860 --> 58:54.100
 or who have survived cancer,

58:54.100 --> 58:59.100
 you see this beautiful connection with life

58:59.660 --> 59:01.900
 that can easily sort of,

59:01.900 --> 59:04.420
 you can kind of lose that connection with life

59:04.420 --> 59:05.940
 if you forget you're gonna die.

59:05.940 --> 59:08.100
 Forgetting you're gonna die is,

59:08.100 --> 59:10.260
 or that you can die is not just,

59:10.260 --> 59:12.180
 I think from an evolutionary perspective

59:12.180 --> 59:14.220
 where survival is the game,

59:14.220 --> 59:17.340
 not gonna improve your survival chances, you know,

59:17.340 --> 59:19.860
 if you think you're immortal, you know,

59:19.860 --> 59:23.720
 but also forgetting that you're gonna die

59:23.720 --> 59:27.780
 and that everything is around you and everything,

59:27.780 --> 59:30.300
 your clothes are probably gonna last longer than you,

59:30.300 --> 59:32.540
 your equipment is gonna be around much longer than you,

59:32.540 --> 59:35.720
 you know, like, so forgetting these things,

59:36.980 --> 59:38.700
 it can lead,

59:38.700 --> 59:40.660
 and I know why people don't wanna think about death

59:40.660 --> 59:44.640
 because it's scary, it's fucking scary, it's terrifying.

59:44.640 --> 59:48.340
 So I get why people don't wanna think about it.

59:48.340 --> 59:51.900
 But the idea is if I try to pretend I'm not gonna die

59:51.900 --> 59:53.540
 or just don't think about death

59:53.540 --> 59:55.700
 or don't at least address it,

59:57.820 --> 59:59.620
 then I won't feel scared.

59:59.620 --> 1:00:01.200
 But it can have the opposite effect,

1:00:01.200 --> 1:00:05.760
 which is you can end up like missing a lot of moments.

1:00:05.760 --> 1:00:08.740
 You could, or you start doing the old kick the can

1:00:08.740 --> 1:00:11.400
 down the road thing where you're like coming up

1:00:11.400 --> 1:00:14.520
 with a variety of ways to procrastinate,

1:00:14.520 --> 1:00:16.760
 making it work now,

1:00:17.880 --> 1:00:21.120
 because you know, this fucking human lifespan idea, man,

1:00:21.120 --> 1:00:22.660
 it's really caused a lot of problems.

1:00:22.660 --> 1:00:24.820
 When they started saying on average,

1:00:24.820 --> 1:00:26.640
 this is how many years you're gonna live

1:00:26.640 --> 1:00:28.240
 if you're a human being,

1:00:28.240 --> 1:00:30.640
 man, that is like really bad

1:00:30.640 --> 1:00:31.740
 because a lot of people hear that

1:00:31.740 --> 1:00:35.960
 and they like feel like that's a guaranteed number of years

1:00:35.960 --> 1:00:40.960
 in some temporal bank that they have access to.

1:00:41.140 --> 1:00:43.360
 And when you get cancer,

1:00:43.360 --> 1:00:46.280
 that's like when you get the alert on your phone

1:00:46.280 --> 1:00:47.400
 where you're like, what the fuck?

1:00:47.400 --> 1:00:48.240
 Wait, what?

1:00:48.240 --> 1:00:51.760
 Like, oh shit, like I have like,

1:00:51.760 --> 1:00:54.760
 either I don't know how much money's in that bank account

1:00:54.760 --> 1:00:57.040
 or I have way less than I thought.

1:00:57.040 --> 1:01:00.840
 And so at that point, you get to be in the truth

1:01:00.840 --> 1:01:03.720
 because that's ultimately, I think that's what it feels like.

1:01:03.720 --> 1:01:06.560
 It feels like truth. It's truth.

1:01:06.560 --> 1:01:07.640
 It's the truth.

1:01:07.640 --> 1:01:08.460
 It's the truth.

1:01:08.460 --> 1:01:11.080
 Like the whole bubble of ignorance

1:01:11.080 --> 1:01:14.480
 that you subconsciously built around yourself

1:01:14.480 --> 1:01:18.680
 to avoid experiencing the terror of your own mortality,

1:01:18.680 --> 1:01:22.640
 just, it's like a meteorite in the form of your doctor

1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:24.720
 talking to you just shatters that thing.

1:01:24.720 --> 1:01:28.040
 And now you're like, especially with eye testicular cancer.

1:01:28.040 --> 1:01:33.040
 So when you get the diagnosis, it's just like the movies.

1:01:38.800 --> 1:01:41.760
 The mother, the doctor took me in his office

1:01:41.760 --> 1:01:44.000
 and you just know, I got cancer.

1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:45.160
 It's like, you don't even have to say.

1:01:45.160 --> 1:01:46.400
 It's like, I know what you're about to say.

1:01:46.400 --> 1:01:48.240
 I'm in the office. I know how this goes.

1:01:48.240 --> 1:01:51.360
 But you go in there and what you were thinking,

1:01:51.360 --> 1:01:53.840
 oh, you know, probably just have some weird thing

1:01:53.840 --> 1:01:54.680
 in my ball.

1:01:54.680 --> 1:01:55.800
 That's why it's swollen up like that.

1:01:55.800 --> 1:01:57.520
 Anytime I've gone to the doctor,

1:01:57.520 --> 1:01:59.880
 you always leave like, oh, cool, I'm fine.

1:01:59.880 --> 1:02:02.440
 But no, that's not how you're gonna leave the doctor.

1:02:02.440 --> 1:02:03.480
 You're gonna leave the doctor

1:02:03.480 --> 1:02:06.420
 in a completely different universe

1:02:06.420 --> 1:02:07.600
 than the one you grew up in.

1:02:07.600 --> 1:02:09.960
 You're gonna go from, talk about multiverse.

1:02:09.960 --> 1:02:12.800
 You just popped into a brand new multiverse.

1:02:12.800 --> 1:02:13.640
 So.

1:02:13.640 --> 1:02:15.280
 What was the conversation with the doctor like?

1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:19.300
 Was there like, from a perspective of a doctor,

1:02:19.300 --> 1:02:21.180
 boys had a hard conversation.

1:02:21.180 --> 1:02:23.360
 I feel like you need to build up philosophically

1:02:23.360 --> 1:02:25.320
 to that conversation.

1:02:25.320 --> 1:02:26.720
 Oh no.

1:02:26.720 --> 1:02:28.280
 Oh no, there's not time.

1:02:28.280 --> 1:02:29.120
 He's busy.

1:02:29.120 --> 1:02:30.520
 He's got other appointments, you know.

1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:34.720
 Also, if you're gonna get cancer, testicular cancer is,

1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:37.180
 you know, not that there is a great cancer to get,

1:02:37.180 --> 1:02:39.240
 but that's the, you know, that's a good one

1:02:39.240 --> 1:02:41.360
 because it moves slowly.

1:02:42.520 --> 1:02:46.660
 The treatments they have for it are really advanced now.

1:02:46.660 --> 1:02:51.320
 And so if you catch it early, then, you know,

1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:55.080
 generally it's good, you can survive it.

1:02:55.080 --> 1:02:56.240
 So.

1:02:56.240 --> 1:02:58.480
 So he could offer at least some glimmer of hope.

1:02:58.480 --> 1:03:00.000
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:02.600
 I mean, you know, but he didn't really do,

1:03:02.600 --> 1:03:04.800
 he couldn't really offer that hope

1:03:04.800 --> 1:03:07.960
 because we had to find out how far the cancer progressed

1:03:07.960 --> 1:03:09.280
 in my body.

1:03:09.280 --> 1:03:11.000
 That's the next step is like,

1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:12.440
 as soon as they tell you you have cancer,

1:03:12.440 --> 1:03:14.740
 they don't, they're not, they move quick.

1:03:14.740 --> 1:03:18.820
 They're like, you know, we're going to schedule the surgery

1:03:18.820 --> 1:03:21.560
 for, I think this was a Thursday or Friday.

1:03:21.560 --> 1:03:24.720
 They're like, we're gonna schedule it for Tuesday.

1:03:24.720 --> 1:03:26.800
 Here's the chance, here's,

1:03:26.800 --> 1:03:27.980
 we don't know for sure it's cancer.

1:03:27.980 --> 1:03:28.820
 That's what they say.

1:03:28.820 --> 1:03:33.440
 It's like, there's a 80 or 90% chance that this is cancer.

1:03:33.440 --> 1:03:36.680
 There is some possibility it could be something else.

1:03:36.680 --> 1:03:40.800
 The only way we can now is like doing a biopsy.

1:03:40.800 --> 1:03:42.520
 And the only way that we can get that biopsy

1:03:42.520 --> 1:03:44.200
 is by cutting one of your balls off.

1:03:44.200 --> 1:03:46.200
 He didn't say it like that, but you know,

1:03:46.200 --> 1:03:47.960
 that's pretty much the logic behind it.

1:03:47.960 --> 1:03:49.120
 It's like, we got to get this thing.

1:03:49.120 --> 1:03:50.520
 It's like a zombie bite.

1:03:50.520 --> 1:03:51.920
 We got to hack this fucking thing off

1:03:51.920 --> 1:03:53.120
 and we got to do it fast.

1:03:53.120 --> 1:03:55.440
 But did you say it in a way that you understood?

1:03:55.440 --> 1:03:58.160
 Yeah, what they do is because they know

1:03:58.160 --> 1:04:00.540
 that when someone gets a cancer diagnosis,

1:04:00.540 --> 1:04:05.200
 that their ability to comprehend information changes.

1:04:05.200 --> 1:04:07.160
 When you get a cancer diagnosis,

1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:09.800
 you, all the tropes, they happen.

1:04:09.800 --> 1:04:11.400
 You're hearing it's weird.

1:04:11.400 --> 1:04:13.480
 You're basically having like an anxiety attack,

1:04:13.480 --> 1:04:14.320
 if I had to guess.

1:04:14.320 --> 1:04:16.440
 It's like a hardcore anxiety attack.

1:04:16.440 --> 1:04:19.440
 And then, you know, a nurse is there with me

1:04:19.440 --> 1:04:21.000
 as he's explaining it.

1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.160
 And then her job is, even though he's telling me

1:04:23.160 --> 1:04:25.940
 how to get to the machine that's going to scan my body

1:04:25.940 --> 1:04:28.320
 to see if it's gotten into my brain,

1:04:29.560 --> 1:04:31.340
 he knows I'm not going to remember that.

1:04:31.340 --> 1:04:35.160
 And so this nurse, when you're in this like fog,

1:04:35.160 --> 1:04:38.060
 takes you, at least took me to the machine

1:04:38.060 --> 1:04:39.560
 that does the scan,

1:04:39.560 --> 1:04:42.320
 but you're not going to get that data back for a few days.

1:04:42.320 --> 1:04:47.320
 And so that's where you really live in the real world.

1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:48.920
 That's the real world.

1:04:48.920 --> 1:04:52.720
 It's such a fascinating moment and the days that follow

1:04:52.720 --> 1:04:55.000
 and even that moment, because that doctor,

1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:57.240
 you know, you talk about the matrix where like the pills

1:04:57.240 --> 1:05:00.960
 and so on, you get the blue pill and the red pill.

1:05:00.960 --> 1:05:01.840
 Yeah.

1:05:01.840 --> 1:05:06.840
 This is like the, like the real world introduction,

1:05:07.680 --> 1:05:10.360
 the human introduction is the truth.

1:05:10.360 --> 1:05:13.220
 You've now just taken the red pill.

1:05:13.220 --> 1:05:16.200
 You get to see the truth of reality.

1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:19.160
 And here's a busy doctor just telling you.

1:05:19.160 --> 1:05:20.000
 Yeah.

1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:22.800
 Like all those dreams you've had,

1:05:22.800 --> 1:05:25.900
 all those illusions you've built up to somehow your work

1:05:25.900 --> 1:05:29.720
 as a comedian and actor will make you live forever somehow.

1:05:29.720 --> 1:05:32.240
 It's just the basic illusion we have that we're,

1:05:32.240 --> 1:05:36.760
 this whole project is going to be an infinite sequence

1:05:36.760 --> 1:05:38.340
 of fun things that we're going to get to do.

1:05:38.340 --> 1:05:39.840
 It's like, holy shit, it's not.

1:05:39.840 --> 1:05:40.680
 That's right.

1:05:40.680 --> 1:05:41.500
 It's old.

1:05:41.500 --> 1:05:42.340
 That's right.

1:05:42.340 --> 1:05:44.800
 And there's very sophisticated ways of doing that.

1:05:44.800 --> 1:05:46.600
 And there's very dumb ways of doing that.

1:05:46.600 --> 1:05:48.800
 And I'd really been doing a dumb way of doing that.

1:05:48.800 --> 1:05:52.920
 Like I'd been playing around with this idiot notion

1:05:52.920 --> 1:05:54.840
 of subjective consciousness.

1:05:54.840 --> 1:05:57.200
 So like, I'd been sort of kicking around this,

1:05:57.200 --> 1:05:59.240
 like I think they call it solipsism.

1:05:59.240 --> 1:06:02.920
 It's like, you're like, okay, I know I'm self aware,

1:06:02.920 --> 1:06:05.480
 but no one else can prove that they're self aware.

1:06:05.480 --> 1:06:08.720
 Like I don't, I have no way of proving

1:06:08.720 --> 1:06:11.200
 that everything around me isn't just a video game,

1:06:11.200 --> 1:06:14.400
 isn't just some projection, isn't, you know,

1:06:14.400 --> 1:06:15.240
 who knows what.

1:06:15.240 --> 1:06:18.200
 So maybe everybody else dies.

1:06:18.200 --> 1:06:20.400
 They're NPCs, but I don't,

1:06:20.400 --> 1:06:22.240
 because I'm the only thing I know

1:06:22.240 --> 1:06:24.160
 that has subjective consciousness.

1:06:24.160 --> 1:06:26.040
 Now, it's not like I really believed that.

1:06:26.040 --> 1:06:28.480
 It's like an idea you toy around with

1:06:28.480 --> 1:06:31.600
 when you're trying to evade confronting the reality

1:06:31.600 --> 1:06:32.520
 of your own mortality.

1:06:32.520 --> 1:06:34.440
 It's just the brain will produce all kinds

1:06:34.440 --> 1:06:36.160
 of ridiculous forms of ignorance.

1:06:36.160 --> 1:06:38.360
 And that was one I'd been playing around with.

1:06:38.360 --> 1:06:40.760
 Oh, you mean for like a large part of your life

1:06:40.760 --> 1:06:41.600
 you were playing around with that?

1:06:41.600 --> 1:06:42.840
 Well, not like really,

1:06:42.840 --> 1:06:44.800
 I think it's important to really emphasize,

1:06:44.800 --> 1:06:46.960
 I didn't think I was a mortal.

1:06:46.960 --> 1:06:49.640
 Like I knew at some level, I'm probably gonna die.

1:06:49.640 --> 1:06:51.000
 Everyone dies.

1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:56.000
 But there's ways that you can sort of poke around

1:06:56.520 --> 1:06:57.640
 with that idea.

1:06:57.640 --> 1:06:58.960
 I still do it to this day.

1:06:58.960 --> 1:07:00.440
 Like I still do it.

1:07:00.440 --> 1:07:01.920
 Like it's a natural thing to do

1:07:01.920 --> 1:07:05.160
 when you're confronted with that, with annihilation.

1:07:05.160 --> 1:07:06.400
 You wanna way out.

1:07:06.400 --> 1:07:08.640
 You wanna talk your way out, figure it out.

1:07:08.640 --> 1:07:09.880
 There's gotta be some way to fix it.

1:07:09.880 --> 1:07:10.960
 Well, they'll fix it.

1:07:10.960 --> 1:07:12.560
 That's another thing people do.

1:07:12.560 --> 1:07:13.480
 Well, they'll fix it.

1:07:13.480 --> 1:07:14.800
 Yeah, it'd be fine.

1:07:14.800 --> 1:07:16.800
 They'll expand the human lifespan.

1:07:16.800 --> 1:07:17.640
 That's what they'll do.

1:07:17.640 --> 1:07:20.960
 I mean, that's a big argument for it is like,

1:07:20.960 --> 1:07:23.400
 look, the human lifespan up until COVID,

1:07:23.400 --> 1:07:26.520
 which they had to recalculate like the lifespan

1:07:26.520 --> 1:07:29.280
 because of the statistically all the people who died,

1:07:29.280 --> 1:07:30.520
 it like threw it off a little bit.

1:07:30.520 --> 1:07:34.360
 But pandemics aside, the idea was the human lifespan

1:07:34.360 --> 1:07:39.000
 seemed to be increasing by half a year every year,

1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:39.840
 something like that.

1:07:39.840 --> 1:07:41.200
 We were living longer.

1:07:41.200 --> 1:07:45.120
 So all you gotta do, one more half a year.

1:07:45.120 --> 1:07:46.480
 And we're immortal, right?

1:07:46.480 --> 1:07:50.800
 If we live a year longer every year, then we live forever.

1:07:50.800 --> 1:07:53.240
 And so that's another way you can get out

1:07:53.240 --> 1:07:55.280
 of confronting death is you can think,

1:07:55.280 --> 1:07:58.520
 well, maybe right now we don't have the tech,

1:07:58.520 --> 1:07:59.360
 but it's coming.

1:07:59.360 --> 1:08:03.440
 Consciousness uploads or downloads or whatever,

1:08:03.440 --> 1:08:05.080
 depending on how you wanna look at it.

1:08:05.080 --> 1:08:09.600
 Another way people try to squirm out of the reality of death.

1:08:09.600 --> 1:08:11.040
 There's all kinds of tricks.

1:08:11.040 --> 1:08:13.600
 Yeah, and we do all of them.

1:08:13.600 --> 1:08:17.160
 And sometimes, yeah, I mean, a lot of religions

1:08:17.160 --> 1:08:20.320
 provide different, even more tools in the toolkit

1:08:20.320 --> 1:08:23.440
 for coming up with ideas of how you can live

1:08:23.440 --> 1:08:25.280
 in the illusion that we're not going to,

1:08:25.280 --> 1:08:28.040
 there's not an end to this particular experience

1:08:28.040 --> 1:08:29.920
 that we're having here on earth right now.

1:08:29.920 --> 1:08:32.720
 And then when you get that cancer diagnosis,

1:08:32.720 --> 1:08:36.040
 it's like, yeah, what was that like going home?

1:08:37.160 --> 1:08:39.680
 The car ride, did you drive home alone?

1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:42.120
 Yeah, I mean, it was one of the most.

1:08:42.120 --> 1:08:44.400
 What'd you listen to, Bruce Springsteen?

1:08:44.400 --> 1:08:47.920
 Bruce Springsteen, hey little girl, is your daddy home?

1:08:47.920 --> 1:08:49.160
 That's not a good one to listen to.

1:08:49.160 --> 1:08:52.000
 Does he have cancer, is he gonna die?

1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:53.760
 Yeah, all the love songs.

1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:56.520
 Maybe you experienced them more intensely.

1:08:57.560 --> 1:08:59.440
 I don't remember what I listened to,

1:09:00.440 --> 1:09:02.600
 and I don't remember driving home,

1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:06.800
 but I do remember driving to another doctor appointment,

1:09:06.800 --> 1:09:09.960
 doctor's appointment the next day.

1:09:10.920 --> 1:09:12.280
 I think it was the next day.

1:09:13.200 --> 1:09:16.320
 I think the Goodyear blimp was floating in the sky

1:09:16.320 --> 1:09:19.320
 and I was looking, I was at a stoplight, looking around.

1:09:19.320 --> 1:09:20.520
 Is that God?

1:09:20.520 --> 1:09:25.520
 Is the person flying it know how to cure cancer?

1:09:26.480 --> 1:09:28.440
 Oh, you were looking, oh wow.

1:09:28.440 --> 1:09:29.760
 No, I didn't think that.

1:09:29.760 --> 1:09:32.920
 What I thought was this shit just keeps going.

1:09:32.920 --> 1:09:34.000
 That's what I thought.

1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:36.760
 I thought, I'm gonna be gone

1:09:36.760 --> 1:09:38.760
 and this is just gonna keep going.

1:09:38.760 --> 1:09:40.840
 And that was a beautiful moment for me.

1:09:40.840 --> 1:09:42.400
 It was this beautiful moment of like.

1:09:42.400 --> 1:09:43.640
 You were able to accept it?

1:09:43.640 --> 1:09:44.640
 Oh yeah.

1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:46.440
 No, like that's just what you're talking about

1:09:46.440 --> 1:09:50.080
 with the Ukraine, what you're talking about.

1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:54.120
 It's like, unless you've been there,

1:09:54.120 --> 1:09:56.360
 it's really hard to explain to people

1:09:56.360 --> 1:10:01.360
 that even in the midst of what is generally accepted

1:10:01.360 --> 1:10:04.080
 as one of the worst fucking things that could happen to you,

1:10:04.080 --> 1:10:09.080
 war, cancer, somehow there's still joy.

1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:12.520
 There's still love.

1:10:12.520 --> 1:10:14.840
 There's still, in fact, more.

1:10:14.840 --> 1:10:17.680
 It's almost like when the anesthesia wears off,

1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:21.040
 when you get your mouth worked on, you start feeling again.

1:10:21.040 --> 1:10:25.600
 You're feeling, you're noticing and that, wow.

1:10:25.600 --> 1:10:29.680
 But yet, thank goodness.

1:10:29.680 --> 1:10:31.480
 I think there's other ways for us to achieve

1:10:31.480 --> 1:10:35.640
 this state of consciousness that don't involve war or cancer.

1:10:35.640 --> 1:10:36.480
 Thank God.

1:10:36.480 --> 1:10:41.280
 You think just meditating on your mortality

1:10:41.280 --> 1:10:42.920
 is one such mechanism?

1:10:42.920 --> 1:10:47.920
 Just simply just not allowing yourself to get lost

1:10:48.280 --> 1:10:51.440
 in the day to day illusion of life.

1:10:51.440 --> 1:10:56.000
 Just kind of stopping, putting on Bruce Springsteen.

1:10:56.000 --> 1:11:00.720
 The most spiritual, he is great.

1:11:00.720 --> 1:11:01.920
 Maybe Johnny Cash hurt.

1:11:01.920 --> 1:11:02.760
 Maybe that one.

1:11:02.760 --> 1:11:03.600
 I like Bruce Springsteen.

1:11:03.600 --> 1:11:05.240
 I am knocking Bruce Springsteen.

1:11:05.240 --> 1:11:07.680
 I have a lot of great Bruce Springsteen memories, truly.

1:11:07.680 --> 1:11:09.480
 His music's fantastic.

1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:13.320
 Yeah, but not meditating on mortality to Bruce Springsteen.

1:11:13.320 --> 1:11:14.160
 You know what?

1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:17.080
 I'm just trying to do an audio soundtrack in my head.

1:11:17.080 --> 1:11:19.520
 I guess we can each have our own audio soundtrack.

1:11:19.520 --> 1:11:22.520
 Oh, I'm on fire.

1:11:22.520 --> 1:11:23.360
 It's so good.

1:11:23.360 --> 1:11:24.200
 Yeah, it's a good song.

1:11:24.200 --> 1:11:25.040
 That's one of them.

1:11:25.040 --> 1:11:27.640
 I lay with the sheets soaking wet

1:11:27.640 --> 1:11:30.920
 and the freight train running through the middle of my head

1:11:30.920 --> 1:11:33.520
 and only you can cool my desire.

1:11:33.520 --> 1:11:35.920
 And he's singing about someone else's girl.

1:11:35.920 --> 1:11:37.840
 What a fucking nightmare.

1:11:37.840 --> 1:11:40.240
 Bruce Springsteen's laying in bed

1:11:40.240 --> 1:11:41.960
 with a freight train running through his head

1:11:41.960 --> 1:11:45.360
 thinking about banging your wife and you're out of town.

1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:46.200
 Oh my God.

1:11:46.200 --> 1:11:47.720
 Oh, you're taking the other guy's perspective.

1:11:47.720 --> 1:11:49.920
 Like, holy shit, this guy's gonna get my wife.

1:11:49.920 --> 1:11:52.200
 It's Bruce, yeah, you gotta take the other guy's.

1:11:52.200 --> 1:11:53.320
 But it's love.

1:11:53.320 --> 1:11:54.240
 Both perspectives.

1:11:54.240 --> 1:11:55.920
 I'm sure Bruce Springsteen thought it was love

1:11:55.920 --> 1:11:58.880
 when he's sweating in bed, waiting to go to somebody's house.

1:11:58.880 --> 1:12:00.480
 She does too.

1:12:00.480 --> 1:12:01.440
 What, does that marry?

1:12:01.440 --> 1:12:03.080
 If he's gonna break up that marriage,

1:12:03.080 --> 1:12:05.240
 that marriage wasn't strong enough, right?

1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:08.960
 I mean, that relationship, I mean, that's the way of love.

1:12:08.960 --> 1:12:11.840
 What marriage could survive?

1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:12.920
 Bruce Springsteen.

1:12:12.920 --> 1:12:14.120
 Sweaty Bruce Springsteen.

1:12:14.120 --> 1:12:16.760
 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1:12:16.760 --> 1:12:19.240
 Well, maybe one that's based on financial,

1:12:20.640 --> 1:12:23.520
 sort of financial dynamics versus like love

1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:28.360
 and sweaty Bruce Springsteen, like romantic connections.

1:12:28.360 --> 1:12:33.040
 Because there's like a music video of that

1:12:33.040 --> 1:12:35.880
 where he's like a mechanic, I think.

1:12:35.880 --> 1:12:37.560
 So he's like the poor mechanic

1:12:37.560 --> 1:12:42.200
 who falls in love with this girl and there's that magic.

1:12:43.600 --> 1:12:44.440
 I've seen that magic.

1:12:44.440 --> 1:12:47.480
 You connect with people like, I'll see somebody,

1:12:47.480 --> 1:12:50.480
 I think Jack Kerouac has that where he meets

1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:54.360
 this Mexican girl on a bus.

1:12:54.360 --> 1:12:57.800
 And like he talks about that heartbreak you feel

1:12:57.800 --> 1:12:59.920
 when you realize this person you just fell in love with

1:12:59.920 --> 1:13:02.800
 in a split second is heading somewhere else

1:13:02.800 --> 1:13:04.920
 in this too big world.

1:13:04.920 --> 1:13:07.720
 But then he actually realizes in, spoiler alert

1:13:07.720 --> 1:13:10.480
 for On The Road, that they're actually heading the same way

1:13:10.480 --> 1:13:13.360
 and he now builds up the courage to talk to her

1:13:13.360 --> 1:13:15.720
 and they kind of fall in love for a few days.

1:13:15.720 --> 1:13:17.920
 And then he realized, eventually realizes

1:13:17.920 --> 1:13:21.200
 that she may not be the perfect person for him.

1:13:21.200 --> 1:13:23.040
 And all the jealousies comes out.

1:13:23.040 --> 1:13:26.600
 It's like, why is this beautiful girl talking to me at all?

1:13:26.600 --> 1:13:28.640
 And then she's probably some kind of,

1:13:28.640 --> 1:13:31.520
 I mean, and that's, it's not very politically correct

1:13:31.520 --> 1:13:34.960
 but he basically thinks that she's a prostitute

1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:38.320
 and he talks to her about like, who's your pimp

1:13:38.320 --> 1:13:39.160
 and all that kind of stuff.

1:13:39.160 --> 1:13:42.080
 He attacks her in all that kind of way

1:13:42.080 --> 1:13:47.080
 when she's just an innocent, she has a past of that kind.

1:13:47.080 --> 1:13:49.760
 But she's an innocent person and they connected

1:13:49.760 --> 1:13:51.360
 and they fell in love with each other.

1:13:51.360 --> 1:13:54.960
 Her gentleness, his worldliness, all that kind of stuff.

1:13:55.920 --> 1:13:58.200
 But that sometimes it doesn't work out that way

1:13:58.200 --> 1:14:00.000
 and there's that heartbreak when you see,

1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:04.280
 you realize you're never gonna be able to have that.

1:14:04.280 --> 1:14:06.000
 And that's, Bruce Springsteen saw that.

1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:07.760
 This is a married woman.

1:14:07.760 --> 1:14:10.440
 I'm never gonna be able to have that, but I want that.

1:14:10.440 --> 1:14:12.640
 And that's the heartbreak.

1:14:12.640 --> 1:14:16.440
 I gotta say, I just assumed they were fucking, like I didn't.

1:14:16.440 --> 1:14:19.440
 I mean, after the song, like if the song doesn't get to.

1:14:19.440 --> 1:14:21.200
 Hey little girl, is your daddy home?

1:14:21.200 --> 1:14:24.480
 Did he go away and leave you all alone?

1:14:24.480 --> 1:14:28.240
 You know, he's like, he knows she's at home alone.

1:14:28.240 --> 1:14:31.600
 Yeah, but it never materializes.

1:14:31.600 --> 1:14:34.040
 He's, it's longing.

1:14:34.040 --> 1:14:38.320
 It's a man who's not with the thing he craves for.

1:14:38.320 --> 1:14:40.800
 So he's longing for, he's talking about the longing.

1:14:40.800 --> 1:14:41.640
 Right.

1:14:41.640 --> 1:14:43.240
 Not with the having.

1:14:43.240 --> 1:14:45.440
 Hey, if anybody in the CIA is watching this,

1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:47.440
 can you look into Bruce Springsteen's file

1:14:47.440 --> 1:14:49.560
 and let us know if he actually banged the person

1:14:49.560 --> 1:14:50.400
 you wrote that song about?

1:14:50.400 --> 1:14:52.480
 What happens after the song, or between the song?

1:14:52.480 --> 1:14:53.320
 We want facts.

1:14:53.320 --> 1:14:54.640
 Look, the longing though, I'll tell you this.

1:14:54.640 --> 1:14:56.400
 Here's what's interesting about that thing

1:14:56.400 --> 1:14:57.800
 that you're talking about.

1:14:57.800 --> 1:15:01.360
 Have you ever heard of something called Bhakti Yoga?

1:15:01.360 --> 1:15:02.200
 I think so, yeah.

1:15:02.200 --> 1:15:03.480
 It's the yoga of love.

1:15:03.480 --> 1:15:06.080
 And there's all kinds, there's forms of it.

1:15:06.080 --> 1:15:08.880
 The most, the one people know about the most

1:15:08.880 --> 1:15:10.200
 is the Hare Krishnas.

1:15:10.200 --> 1:15:12.760
 But the Hare Krishnas are like, you know,

1:15:12.760 --> 1:15:14.880
 the way in Christianity, you've got the Episcopalians,

1:15:14.880 --> 1:15:16.360
 the Catholics, the Baptists.

1:15:16.360 --> 1:15:19.880
 In Bhakti Yoga, you have various deities

1:15:19.880 --> 1:15:22.920
 that are the object of love.

1:15:22.920 --> 1:15:26.880
 And so Bhakti Yoga is like,

1:15:26.880 --> 1:15:31.880
 and what's really cool about it is it's an analysis of love.

1:15:33.880 --> 1:15:38.240
 And so, and it's the supposition being like,

1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:42.560
 love is the way to commune with the divine.

1:15:42.560 --> 1:15:45.480
 Now, a distinction is drawn between

1:15:45.480 --> 1:15:49.040
 like two big worldviews that are spiritual.

1:15:49.040 --> 1:15:54.040
 One is the concept of sort of unit of consciousness,

1:15:54.880 --> 1:15:58.040
 which you'll run into in a lot of forms of Buddhism,

1:15:58.040 --> 1:16:03.040
 if not all, a sort of a way of deconstructing the identity

1:16:03.640 --> 1:16:07.760
 or understanding that you might not be anything at all.

1:16:07.760 --> 1:16:09.400
 That in fact, you're part of everything.

1:16:09.400 --> 1:16:14.360
 And in that, there's a potential relief

1:16:14.360 --> 1:16:15.520
 from suffering in that,

1:16:15.520 --> 1:16:19.080
 not just like intellectually knowing it, but becoming it.

1:16:19.080 --> 1:16:24.080
 Now, whereas in Bhakti Yoga, there's this idea of like,

1:16:27.920 --> 1:16:30.480
 the best thing is to be the individual

1:16:30.480 --> 1:16:33.480
 because individuals are required for love,

1:16:33.480 --> 1:16:36.760
 this for love to work, embodied love.

1:16:36.760 --> 1:16:41.760
 And so the quality, the thing we call the experience of love

1:16:43.120 --> 1:16:44.880
 is something that can be cultivated.

1:16:44.880 --> 1:16:46.560
 It doesn't just have to be for another person.

1:16:46.560 --> 1:16:48.800
 It doesn't have to be for the stranger on the bus.

1:16:48.800 --> 1:16:52.920
 It doesn't have to be for sweaty Bruce Springsteen's lover

1:16:52.920 --> 1:16:54.880
 that you could actually,

1:16:54.880 --> 1:16:58.400
 you can actually shift that love to the divine, to God.

1:16:58.400 --> 1:17:00.160
 Cause obviously it's the Hare Krishnas,

1:17:00.160 --> 1:17:01.240
 it's a theistic religion.

1:17:01.240 --> 1:17:03.920
 They believe in Krishna who is the,

1:17:03.920 --> 1:17:06.320
 from the POV of Vaisnava Bhakti Yoga,

1:17:06.320 --> 1:17:10.720
 the Godhead, the source from which everything

1:17:10.720 --> 1:17:12.840
 flows into time and space.

1:17:12.840 --> 1:17:17.840
 So there are all these like fascinating stories of Krishna.

1:17:19.800 --> 1:17:22.680
 It's not just, most people are familiar with Krishna

1:17:22.680 --> 1:17:24.120
 from the Bhagavad Gita.

1:17:24.120 --> 1:17:25.680
 They're about to be more, what's cool about it

1:17:25.680 --> 1:17:27.680
 is cause it's like they're making the Oppenheimer movie

1:17:27.680 --> 1:17:29.760
 and he famously quoted the Bhagavad Gita

1:17:29.760 --> 1:17:31.960
 when they split the atom.

1:17:31.960 --> 1:17:35.080
 But there's all these stories of Krishna

1:17:35.080 --> 1:17:39.680
 that are not just in the Bhagavad Gita.

1:17:40.680 --> 1:17:42.240
 And these stories,

1:17:44.200 --> 1:17:47.160
 they could seem very simple when taken literally,

1:17:47.160 --> 1:17:48.680
 but in Vaisnava Bhakti Yoga,

1:17:48.680 --> 1:17:53.600
 it's this very advanced theistic yogic system.

1:17:53.600 --> 1:17:56.560
 So they take these stories and from these stories,

1:17:56.560 --> 1:18:01.560
 they extrapolate this incredible analysis of what love is

1:18:01.560 --> 1:18:02.720
 and how to connect with the universe.

1:18:02.720 --> 1:18:06.280
 So like Krishna has a lover, Radharani.

1:18:06.280 --> 1:18:11.280
 And so sometimes they're getting along.

1:18:13.520 --> 1:18:15.760
 Sometimes they're fighting.

1:18:15.760 --> 1:18:18.920
 Sometimes they're separated.

1:18:18.920 --> 1:18:23.920
 And so each of these ways of feeling about Krishna

1:18:25.960 --> 1:18:28.600
 are modes of love.

1:18:28.600 --> 1:18:31.840
 So longing actually is considered

1:18:31.840 --> 1:18:35.080
 one of the highest forms of love.

1:18:35.080 --> 1:18:38.120
 The idea is the longing is the grace.

1:18:38.120 --> 1:18:39.720
 The longing is the love.

1:18:39.720 --> 1:18:42.240
 So when you find yourself in a situation

1:18:42.240 --> 1:18:45.680
 of longing and heartbreak,

1:18:45.680 --> 1:18:49.520
 it is identical to union.

1:18:50.920 --> 1:18:54.960
 And perhaps more intensely representative

1:18:54.960 --> 1:18:56.480
 of the essence of what is love.

1:18:56.480 --> 1:18:58.600
 Yes, and they call it pining.

1:18:58.600 --> 1:19:01.520
 So there's the, and it's pining for Krishna.

1:19:01.520 --> 1:19:03.800
 And there's also, there's other ways

1:19:03.800 --> 1:19:05.760
 you could be with Krishna is as a friend.

1:19:05.760 --> 1:19:09.840
 So this is another form of love or as a mother,

1:19:11.160 --> 1:19:13.440
 because Krishna has a mother.

1:19:13.440 --> 1:19:16.080
 So there's like all these ways of like looking

1:19:16.080 --> 1:19:17.400
 at the various forms of love.

1:19:17.400 --> 1:19:20.880
 And it's a really beautiful form of yoga.

1:19:20.880 --> 1:19:22.720
 That's emphasizing the individual

1:19:22.720 --> 1:19:25.160
 and the individual as a kind of channel

1:19:25.160 --> 1:19:27.560
 to this universal love.

1:19:27.560 --> 1:19:32.560
 Yeah, there's a lot of different like their answer

1:19:32.560 --> 1:19:35.800
 to the question of what shows up in Buddhism

1:19:35.800 --> 1:19:37.720
 as absolute and relative reality.

1:19:37.720 --> 1:19:41.560
 Like that obviously there's relative reality.

1:19:41.560 --> 1:19:44.760
 We're not right now, you and me are not

1:19:44.760 --> 1:19:46.160
 unit of consciousness.

1:19:46.160 --> 1:19:49.000
 Like you zoom back far enough

1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:51.160
 and we're gonna seem like an atom or whatever.

1:19:51.160 --> 1:19:55.320
 The thing is, the trope is you can zoom back far enough

1:19:55.320 --> 1:19:58.200
 and we're in a whatever, we're in a piece of cheese

1:19:58.200 --> 1:19:59.240
 or something, who knows.

1:19:59.240 --> 1:20:02.200
 But in that way we're like completely unified.

1:20:03.160 --> 1:20:06.160
 But simultaneously we're individuals,

1:20:06.160 --> 1:20:08.000
 like for sure we're individuals.

1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:09.600
 Like you still gotta pay your taxes.

1:20:09.600 --> 1:20:11.200
 You gotta know your social security number.

1:20:11.200 --> 1:20:12.480
 That's relative reality.

1:20:12.480 --> 1:20:15.560
 So, you know, Buddhism is like kind of the balance.

1:20:15.560 --> 1:20:19.800
 Again, when I say Buddhism is I'm a comedian podcast

1:20:19.800 --> 1:20:21.080
 or I'm not some Buddhist expert.

1:20:21.080 --> 1:20:24.880
 This is just probably my confused idea of what it is.

1:20:24.880 --> 1:20:29.040
 But anyway, in bhakti yoga, there's the concept,

1:20:29.040 --> 1:20:31.520
 it's called, I'm gonna mispronounce it,

1:20:31.520 --> 1:20:34.280
 asinka, sinka, beta, tatva.

1:20:34.280 --> 1:20:35.960
 I'm sorry, I'm mispronouncing it.

1:20:36.960 --> 1:20:40.760
 Which means simultaneous oneness and difference.

1:20:40.760 --> 1:20:41.600
 So.

1:20:41.600 --> 1:20:42.960
 Oneness and difference.

1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:44.880
 Yes, simultaneous oneness and difference.

1:20:44.880 --> 1:20:47.360
 So that's why the oneness is the more

1:20:48.400 --> 1:20:50.560
 part of the same piece of cheese

1:20:50.560 --> 1:20:54.000
 and the difference is we are still each paying taxes.

1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:56.640
 Yes, and in this case, the cheese is Krishna.

1:20:56.640 --> 1:21:00.320
 So, you know, or other ways it gets described

1:21:00.320 --> 1:21:03.840
 is like, you know, a photon blasting off the sun

1:21:03.840 --> 1:21:08.120
 has sunlight qualities, but it's not the sun.

1:21:08.120 --> 1:21:12.400
 Humans being one of the many things, you know,

1:21:12.400 --> 1:21:16.040
 flowing out of the creative consciousness of the divine

1:21:16.040 --> 1:21:21.040
 have qualities that are weirdly like the godlike.

1:21:21.040 --> 1:21:24.840
 You know, like we, in fact, we wanna control primarily.

1:21:24.840 --> 1:21:29.400
 That's one of the problems, like humans wanna be in control,

1:21:29.400 --> 1:21:32.200
 wherein from their, the bhakti yoga perspective,

1:21:32.200 --> 1:21:37.200
 Krishna is effortlessly controlling everything.

1:21:38.040 --> 1:21:40.840
 And so within the system, the individual parts

1:21:40.840 --> 1:21:43.000
 of the system have that same quality,

1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:45.240
 but you can't, you're probably not God.

1:21:45.240 --> 1:21:46.920
 You might be, I'm not.

1:21:46.920 --> 1:21:51.920
 I'm not. What do you think happens after we die?

1:21:52.480 --> 1:21:57.480
 Having come close to that, that, that cliff

1:21:58.200 --> 1:22:00.880
 and almost got pushed over once.

1:22:00.880 --> 1:22:03.640
 What do you think happens when you do get pushed off

1:22:03.640 --> 1:22:06.840
 the cliff? Okay.

1:22:06.840 --> 1:22:09.280
 I feel dumb that I'm even gonna like preface this

1:22:09.280 --> 1:22:11.800
 by saying, obviously I have no fucking idea.

1:22:11.800 --> 1:22:14.160
 And I think that's one of the cool things about death.

1:22:14.160 --> 1:22:16.680
 No idea. The CIA probably does.

1:22:16.680 --> 1:22:19.200
 You think the CIA, I love like,

1:22:19.200 --> 1:22:21.840
 we've decided your audience is the CIA.

1:22:21.840 --> 1:22:22.880
 Yeah, yeah.

1:22:22.880 --> 1:22:24.200
 How would you, oh, wait.

1:22:24.200 --> 1:22:26.000
 I need to, cause there's a lot of suspicion

1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:28.200
 that I might be FSB and Marsad.

1:22:28.200 --> 1:22:30.120
 So I'm trying to rebrand.

1:22:30.120 --> 1:22:35.320
 I'm trying to steer them into the CIA direction.

1:22:35.320 --> 1:22:37.800
 As far as what happens when you, when you die,

1:22:37.800 --> 1:22:40.800
 one thing I returned to when I'm getting overly complex

1:22:40.800 --> 1:22:43.680
 is the idea of as above, so below.

1:22:43.680 --> 1:22:47.720
 So that you can, a lot of the big questions

1:22:47.720 --> 1:22:52.120
 can be answered by your own experience now.

1:22:52.120 --> 1:22:57.120
 So in other words, like in terms of thinking

1:22:57.600 --> 1:23:02.600
 about like death, if you look back to baby Lex

1:23:07.360 --> 1:23:11.560
 versus adult Lex, where's the baby?

1:23:11.560 --> 1:23:13.120
 Like baby's gone.

1:23:13.120 --> 1:23:17.680
 They, you've regenerated all your cells many times by then.

1:23:17.680 --> 1:23:22.200
 So in a way you could say Lex baby died.

1:23:22.200 --> 1:23:24.520
 The death didn't look like a typical,

1:23:24.520 --> 1:23:27.080
 and I'm not trying to dodge it, but I'm just saying

1:23:27.080 --> 1:23:29.840
 it was very natural that the death of that baby.

1:23:29.840 --> 1:23:32.240
 It just, it just.

1:23:32.240 --> 1:23:35.120
 In many ways that baby died, but I am,

1:23:35.120 --> 1:23:36.960
 at least personally I'm surprised

1:23:36.960 --> 1:23:39.240
 how much the person is exactly the same.

1:23:39.240 --> 1:23:43.240
 So there's many ways in which you're very different,

1:23:43.240 --> 1:23:46.920
 but there's a lot of ways in which you're very much the same.

1:23:46.920 --> 1:23:50.040
 And I wonder if that, if there's,

1:23:50.040 --> 1:23:54.080
 if life is defined by many deaths that continue on,

1:23:54.080 --> 1:23:58.240
 and then I wonder if there's something persists beyond

1:23:58.240 --> 1:24:01.480
 in this, that, yeah, there is something

1:24:01.480 --> 1:24:02.960
 that still persists, I wonder.

1:24:02.960 --> 1:24:04.560
 Okay, so that.

1:24:04.560 --> 1:24:09.560
 Now, you know, obviously there's so many different answers

1:24:09.880 --> 1:24:11.600
 to this question that are religious,

1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:15.200
 and ranging from like the most absurd shit

1:24:15.200 --> 1:24:18.120
 you ever heard in your life, like the gold.

1:24:18.120 --> 1:24:19.480
 You're gonna get a mansion.

1:24:19.480 --> 1:24:20.800
 There's gold streets.

1:24:20.800 --> 1:24:23.600
 Like, I don't, do you want like gold streets?

1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:24.720
 Who offers gold streets?

1:24:24.720 --> 1:24:27.800
 I know about the virgins, but there's a bunch of virgins.

1:24:27.800 --> 1:24:30.640
 The Christians give you the gold streets in the mansion.

1:24:30.640 --> 1:24:35.320
 Like depending on the, whatever the particular sect

1:24:35.320 --> 1:24:39.040
 of Christianity is, you know, it's like some kind of city.

1:24:39.040 --> 1:24:41.360
 There's, it's like paved with gold.

1:24:41.360 --> 1:24:43.080
 No one's addressing the fact that at the moment

1:24:43.080 --> 1:24:44.280
 the streets are made of gold.

1:24:44.280 --> 1:24:46.920
 Gold is a valueless substance.

1:24:46.920 --> 1:24:49.440
 I mean, it's sort of pretty in a cheesy kind of way,

1:24:49.440 --> 1:24:50.600
 but no one's gonna give a shit about it.

1:24:50.600 --> 1:24:55.560
 It's like, if there was not a lot of asphalt in the world,

1:24:55.560 --> 1:24:57.600
 then, you know, we'd be in heaven

1:24:57.600 --> 1:24:59.640
 from that same, that way of thinking.

1:24:59.640 --> 1:25:03.560
 But the, or honestly, when going back,

1:25:03.560 --> 1:25:06.920
 this is starting to get a theme with Gulag Archipelago.

1:25:06.920 --> 1:25:08.440
 I'm sorry, I'm reading it currently.

1:25:08.440 --> 1:25:09.840
 That's a sticky book.

1:25:09.840 --> 1:25:11.600
 Yeah, it's very sticky in your mind.

1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:12.640
 Very, very tough.

1:25:12.640 --> 1:25:14.800
 As I'm running through very hot heat,

1:25:14.800 --> 1:25:16.960
 I'm listening to Gulag Archipelago.

1:25:16.960 --> 1:25:17.800
 Oh my God.

1:25:17.800 --> 1:25:19.000
 And you know, one of the things they said,

1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:21.520
 they would feed prisoners salt,

1:25:23.920 --> 1:25:26.360
 and then they would exchange,

1:25:26.360 --> 1:25:30.240
 the prisoners would be able to give up anything, everything,

1:25:30.240 --> 1:25:31.600
 their gold, their possessions,

1:25:31.600 --> 1:25:33.680
 everything for just one drink of water.

1:25:33.680 --> 1:25:37.600
 So that little context of dehydrating them

1:25:37.600 --> 1:25:41.520
 and feeding them salt changes your value system completely.

1:25:41.520 --> 1:25:44.200
 So maybe the gold is supposed to be a metaphor

1:25:44.200 --> 1:25:46.320
 for something that you still value deeply.

1:25:46.320 --> 1:25:48.920
 Yes, it's, yeah, again, any of these things,

1:25:48.920 --> 1:25:51.200
 when you like take them literally, they seem absurd.

1:25:51.200 --> 1:25:54.360
 But if you look deeper into it, it's like quite beautiful.

1:25:54.360 --> 1:25:58.160
 But the Buddhist version of it is that there's a momentum.

1:25:58.160 --> 1:26:00.480
 The best way to put it is it's the kind of momentum.

1:26:00.480 --> 1:26:02.800
 So the thing you're talking about,

1:26:02.800 --> 1:26:06.520
 which is the personality of the baby

1:26:06.520 --> 1:26:08.320
 that is still in the adult,

1:26:08.320 --> 1:26:10.240
 which is still in the old person,

1:26:10.240 --> 1:26:12.880
 you're looking at a kind of momentum

1:26:12.880 --> 1:26:17.880
 that does not stop upon the extinction of the body.

1:26:17.880 --> 1:26:27.440
 Now, I think there's a lot of, I don't want to say harm,

1:26:27.440 --> 1:26:28.520
 because they didn't mean to hurt,

1:26:28.520 --> 1:26:30.440
 but I think there's some harm that maybe has happened

1:26:30.440 --> 1:26:33.280
 from the way death is represented in movies.

1:26:33.280 --> 1:26:37.040
 Like when people die in movies, it's like there's this,

1:26:37.040 --> 1:26:38.440
 usually it's pretty fast,

1:26:38.440 --> 1:26:42.200
 even if it is what they're dying from is a longterm disease,

1:26:42.200 --> 1:26:45.600
 it like wraps up pretty quickly, starts with a cough,

1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:46.680
 the person's in bed,

1:26:46.680 --> 1:26:50.000
 but there's this weird kind of lucidity to the person

1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:51.640
 up until the point of death.

1:26:51.640 --> 1:26:53.920
 And also they generally, in movies, they have makeup on,

1:26:53.920 --> 1:26:57.280
 which is always funny to me when the person dying looks great.

1:26:57.280 --> 1:27:00.160
 If you've ever been around a dying person, they're dying.

1:27:00.160 --> 1:27:01.320
 They look like shit.

1:27:01.320 --> 1:27:02.160
 You're dying.

1:27:02.160 --> 1:27:05.160
 They're all gray and like confused.

1:27:05.160 --> 1:27:07.440
 They're, you know, when you're around dying people,

1:27:07.440 --> 1:27:09.880
 they will spin through time.

1:27:09.880 --> 1:27:11.880
 Your parents won't recognize you for a second.

1:27:11.880 --> 1:27:13.080
 They'll think you're somebody else.

1:27:13.080 --> 1:27:17.280
 They won't, they're like everything's like

1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:18.440
 the process is happening.

1:27:18.440 --> 1:27:22.000
 So you're very confused when you die.

1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:24.880
 So in general, not all the time,

1:27:24.880 --> 1:27:26.800
 some people die with a clear mind.

1:27:26.800 --> 1:27:28.560
 It just depends on the type of death,

1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:32.320
 but think in terms of getting hit by a car.

1:27:32.320 --> 1:27:35.320
 So you went across the street, you get hit by a car.

1:27:35.320 --> 1:27:39.600
 Now, if we're talking about this momentum continuing,

1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:42.760
 the confusion, assuming you didn't hit your head

1:27:42.760 --> 1:27:45.520
 and you're unconscious, like somehow you just got smashed

1:27:45.520 --> 1:27:47.720
 and you're like bleeding out,

1:27:47.720 --> 1:27:49.120
 even then you're gonna be confused

1:27:49.120 --> 1:27:50.360
 because you're getting dizzy,

1:27:50.360 --> 1:27:52.080
 like blood's leaving your body.

1:27:52.080 --> 1:27:53.400
 You're like, things are fading out.

1:27:53.400 --> 1:27:54.480
 Your vision's going.

1:27:54.480 --> 1:27:57.040
 So it's a very confusing experience initially

1:27:57.040 --> 1:27:58.560
 when the body dies.

1:27:58.560 --> 1:28:02.600
 If you are a materialist who has been,

1:28:03.600 --> 1:28:08.600
 who has convinced themselves that it's a permanent thing,

1:28:08.600 --> 1:28:10.880
 the next bit of confusion is going to be

1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:13.640
 when you realize something is persisting here,

1:28:13.640 --> 1:28:14.640
 like I'm still here.

1:28:14.640 --> 1:28:17.600
 And this is where you run into the near death experiences,

1:28:17.600 --> 1:28:18.960
 which are a global phenomena

1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:23.720
 that don't seem to be completely shaped by culture.

1:28:23.720 --> 1:28:25.440
 Like regardless of what part of the world

1:28:25.440 --> 1:28:27.480
 people are having these experiences in,

1:28:27.480 --> 1:28:31.000
 the reports tend to be similar and everyone's heard it,

1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:33.160
 the light, the life review,

1:28:35.600 --> 1:28:38.400
 seeing ancestors and stuff like that.

1:28:38.400 --> 1:28:40.600
 Now, I don't know what that is.

1:28:40.600 --> 1:28:41.960
 I don't know.

1:28:43.520 --> 1:28:46.960
 Sometimes I think that's probably just like a built in way

1:28:46.960 --> 1:28:48.880
 the computer shuts down.

1:28:48.880 --> 1:28:50.520
 This is something it does, who knows?

1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:55.520
 But in Buddhism, the concept is this momentum persists

1:28:55.840 --> 1:28:57.320
 into something called the bardo.

1:28:57.320 --> 1:28:59.240
 The bardo means in between.

1:28:59.240 --> 1:29:02.360
 And there's an actual number of days

1:29:02.360 --> 1:29:04.560
 they say that you get to hang out there.

1:29:04.560 --> 1:29:07.720
 And I can't remember, it's like 37 days or 29 days

1:29:07.720 --> 1:29:09.000
 or something, I'm not sure.

1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:13.160
 But at least from the time space perspective,

1:29:13.160 --> 1:29:14.720
 that's how long they're there.

1:29:14.720 --> 1:29:16.160
 Within this place,

1:29:18.960 --> 1:29:21.760
 there are a lot of technological parallels, man.

1:29:21.760 --> 1:29:26.520
 It's like in the way the algorithm is reflective,

1:29:26.520 --> 1:29:28.840
 it assesses your desires or whatever

1:29:28.840 --> 1:29:32.320
 and then produces something that has within it

1:29:32.320 --> 1:29:34.800
 a component of attraction to you.

1:29:34.800 --> 1:29:36.720
 Apparently this happens in the bardo.

1:29:36.720 --> 1:29:39.240
 Or the way you wake up in the morning

1:29:39.240 --> 1:29:42.920
 and you're in a shitty mood.

1:29:42.920 --> 1:29:46.760
 And then coincidentally, everyone that day is an asshole.

1:29:46.760 --> 1:29:49.120
 If you don't catch it, you could just be like, wow,

1:29:49.120 --> 1:29:50.880
 I guess it's act like an asshole day.

1:29:50.880 --> 1:29:54.400
 You don't realize you're seeing your asshole projection

1:29:55.640 --> 1:29:58.880
 being reflected off the screen of another person.

1:29:58.880 --> 1:30:00.480
 So in the bardo apparently,

1:30:00.480 --> 1:30:03.480
 you don't need people for the reflective quality.

1:30:03.480 --> 1:30:04.920
 These projections happen

1:30:04.920 --> 1:30:09.080
 and they appear as either Nietzsche's demon

1:30:09.080 --> 1:30:10.600
 or Nietzsche's angel.

1:30:10.600 --> 1:30:14.360
 It just depends on where you're at and how you died.

1:30:14.360 --> 1:30:18.400
 And if you died scared, then at least initially

1:30:18.400 --> 1:30:20.960
 that's gonna be some scary shit you see around you.

1:30:20.960 --> 1:30:23.200
 If you died in a peaceful way,

1:30:23.200 --> 1:30:27.280
 well then there's gonna be more of a possibility

1:30:27.280 --> 1:30:32.280
 of navigation through this liminal intermediary place.

1:30:32.280 --> 1:30:36.440
 And so thus the emphasis on meditation in Buddhism,

1:30:36.440 --> 1:30:41.440
 a way to calm one's self, to not be distracted by thoughts,

1:30:41.760 --> 1:30:43.960
 which are their own like apparitions.

1:30:43.960 --> 1:30:47.080
 And then theoretically, if you wanted to,

1:30:47.080 --> 1:30:49.960
 instead of spinning the wheel again

1:30:49.960 --> 1:30:52.160
 and jumping back into a body,

1:30:52.160 --> 1:30:54.040
 you could choose not to do that.

1:30:54.040 --> 1:30:57.840
 And then transcend the wheel of birth and death.

1:30:57.840 --> 1:31:00.440
 But if you still wanted to go back,

1:31:00.440 --> 1:31:05.360
 if you still wanted to go back or return or whatever,

1:31:05.360 --> 1:31:06.640
 however you wanna put it,

1:31:06.640 --> 1:31:08.800
 then you could have more control

1:31:08.800 --> 1:31:12.120
 over what your next birth might be

1:31:12.120 --> 1:31:15.080
 versus in this depiction of things,

1:31:15.080 --> 1:31:19.000
 people running from demons that they don't recognize

1:31:19.000 --> 1:31:23.120
 as their own projection into any fucking body

1:31:23.120 --> 1:31:24.460
 that they can find.

1:31:24.460 --> 1:31:26.880
 Because if you've had a body, you want a body.

1:31:26.880 --> 1:31:29.580
 And so this is how you can incarnate as an animal.

1:31:29.580 --> 1:31:32.080
 This is how you can incarnate in the hell realms.

1:31:32.080 --> 1:31:34.280
 This is how you can incarnate in any variety of things.

1:31:34.280 --> 1:31:38.680
 But the idea is like maybe you could slow down a little bit

1:31:38.680 --> 1:31:40.360
 and like choose a birth

1:31:40.360 --> 1:31:43.040
 that is gonna be more conducive to you

1:31:45.600 --> 1:31:48.360
 continuing to like spiritually evolve.

1:31:48.360 --> 1:31:49.440
 I like that idea.

1:31:49.440 --> 1:31:50.480
 Is it true or not?

1:31:50.480 --> 1:31:51.320
 Who the fuck knows?

1:31:51.320 --> 1:31:52.940
 Algorithmically speaking,

1:31:52.940 --> 1:31:55.040
 it seems like a really fun role playing game

1:31:55.040 --> 1:31:57.960
 where you basically keep improving

1:31:57.960 --> 1:32:02.480
 the different parameters based on your ability

1:32:03.680 --> 1:32:07.180
 and willingness to meditate

1:32:07.180 --> 1:32:12.180
 and let go of the menial concerns of life on earth.

1:32:14.800 --> 1:32:19.200
 Why do you think Buddhists see life as suffering?

1:32:19.200 --> 1:32:20.680
 What's suffering?

1:32:20.680 --> 1:32:22.440
 Okay, well, first of all,

1:32:23.680 --> 1:32:26.360
 that gets mistranslated quite a bit.

1:32:26.360 --> 1:32:27.960
 You're talking about the four noble truths.

1:32:27.960 --> 1:32:29.080
 The first one is,

1:32:29.080 --> 1:32:31.980
 often it's translated as life is suffering,

1:32:31.980 --> 1:32:36.800
 which is not it, it's there is suffering.

1:32:36.800 --> 1:32:38.160
 The whole life is suffering thing

1:32:38.160 --> 1:32:40.640
 is just like a spiritual version of life's a bitch,

1:32:40.640 --> 1:32:41.800
 then you die.

1:32:41.800 --> 1:32:42.880
 And people hear that and they're like,

1:32:42.880 --> 1:32:44.840
 yeah, life is fucking suffering,

1:32:44.840 --> 1:32:47.360
 but it's there is suffering, there is suffering.

1:32:47.360 --> 1:32:50.000
 So it's an affirmation.

1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:53.360
 If you're like this thing that a lot of people feel

1:32:53.360 --> 1:32:55.240
 that they associate with lots of,

1:32:55.240 --> 1:32:57.880
 they have a lot of reasons they think they're feeling it

1:32:57.880 --> 1:33:00.880
 is known as fundamental dissatisfaction.

1:33:00.880 --> 1:33:03.760
 So another word for suffering,

1:33:03.760 --> 1:33:06.480
 maybe it could be fundamental dissatisfaction.

1:33:06.480 --> 1:33:09.540
 Also, the term itself,

1:33:11.220 --> 1:33:14.320
 maybe a better translation is wobbly wheel.

1:33:14.320 --> 1:33:16.880
 So like, imagine like when your bike doesn't have,

1:33:16.880 --> 1:33:18.800
 or your car doesn't have enough air in the tires,

1:33:18.800 --> 1:33:21.020
 your bike doesn't have enough air in the tires,

1:33:21.020 --> 1:33:22.560
 it's kind of a shitty bike ride.

1:33:22.560 --> 1:33:25.720
 Like no matter what, it's kind of like uncomfortable.

1:33:25.720 --> 1:33:27.280
 It's like irritating.

1:33:27.280 --> 1:33:30.760
 So this is what's being pointed to

1:33:30.760 --> 1:33:34.900
 is that there's this quality within a human life

1:33:34.900 --> 1:33:39.880
 that is unsatisfying.

1:33:39.880 --> 1:33:41.240
 Like a wobbly wheel.

1:33:41.240 --> 1:33:42.600
 Wobbly wheel.

1:33:42.600 --> 1:33:47.600
 Why do you think, what is the core of that dissatisfaction?

1:33:48.040 --> 1:33:51.900
 Because it could be as simple as kind of physical

1:33:51.900 --> 1:33:55.480
 and mental discomfort and sadness and depression

1:33:55.480 --> 1:33:57.040
 and all that kind of stuff.

1:33:57.040 --> 1:33:59.920
 Or it could be more speaking to the sort of existentialist,

1:33:59.920 --> 1:34:03.720
 the philosophical, the absurdity of it all.

1:34:03.720 --> 1:34:05.540
 The fact that stuff happens,

1:34:05.540 --> 1:34:07.200
 good stuff happens for no reason,

1:34:07.200 --> 1:34:08.920
 bad stuff happens for no reason.

1:34:10.160 --> 1:34:13.980
 Yeah, it's no matter how much you try,

1:34:15.120 --> 1:34:19.220
 there's not a universal fairness to the whole thing.

1:34:19.220 --> 1:34:22.200
 There's not even a universal meaning to the whole thing.

1:34:22.200 --> 1:34:24.800
 So the existentialist perspective.

1:34:24.800 --> 1:34:27.400
 What flavor of suffering do you prefer?

1:34:27.400 --> 1:34:28.520
 If it was an ice cream shop.

1:34:28.520 --> 1:34:29.360
 That's so funny.

1:34:29.360 --> 1:34:32.720
 Well, I'm definitely picking desire over the,

1:34:32.720 --> 1:34:36.440
 like if in the RGB that we're talking about here

1:34:36.440 --> 1:34:41.120
 is desire, aversion and ignorance.

1:34:41.120 --> 1:34:46.120
 So if you want to find like the three ingredients

1:34:46.120 --> 1:34:49.900
 that are giving everyone their sophisticated bits

1:34:49.900 --> 1:34:51.320
 of suffering, there you go.

1:34:51.320 --> 1:34:52.820
 That's what it is.

1:34:52.820 --> 1:34:56.160
 In which way does desire manifest itself in suffering?

1:34:56.160 --> 1:34:57.140
 It hurts.

1:34:57.140 --> 1:34:59.080
 To lose, to not have.

1:34:59.080 --> 1:35:02.920
 Like, yeah, it hurts to not, like to eternally not have,

1:35:02.920 --> 1:35:05.240
 but just like my friend pointed this out.

1:35:05.240 --> 1:35:09.680
 He's like, you know, like you order something from Amazon.

1:35:09.680 --> 1:35:10.860
 Like even in the smallest way,

1:35:10.860 --> 1:35:12.440
 you're excited about whatever the thing is.

1:35:12.440 --> 1:35:14.160
 You order this thing from Amazon,

1:35:14.160 --> 1:35:16.080
 it's not coming for four days.

1:35:16.080 --> 1:35:18.980
 So those four days are going to be somewhat marked

1:35:18.980 --> 1:35:22.200
 by you being what people say, I'm excited about it.

1:35:22.200 --> 1:35:25.680
 But really, if you look at that feeling, it's uncomfortable.

1:35:25.680 --> 1:35:28.640
 Like the feeling of wanting the thing is uncomfortable.

1:35:28.640 --> 1:35:31.040
 So that is a form of suffering.

1:35:31.040 --> 1:35:32.320
 That's suffering.

1:35:32.320 --> 1:35:33.160
 Interesting.

1:35:33.160 --> 1:35:34.480
 I mean, I wonder,

1:35:34.480 --> 1:35:38.960
 cause we naturally reframe that in our mind, wanting.

1:35:38.960 --> 1:35:41.480
 We reframe that as a good thing.

1:35:41.480 --> 1:35:46.480
 As a, and maybe suffering is fundamentally good

1:35:49.940 --> 1:35:52.780
 in the way we think of what life is.

1:35:52.780 --> 1:35:55.740
 So like, it's life affirming,

1:35:55.740 --> 1:35:58.300
 but it's not usually how the word suffering is used.

1:35:58.300 --> 1:36:00.100
 Well, it's true.

1:36:00.100 --> 1:36:00.940
 It's true.

1:36:00.940 --> 1:36:03.380
 Like the first noble truth of Buddhism is true.

1:36:03.380 --> 1:36:05.300
 It's called the truth of suffering.

1:36:05.300 --> 1:36:06.740
 There is suffering.

1:36:06.740 --> 1:36:08.740
 I mean, this is like an, I don't know,

1:36:08.740 --> 1:36:11.500
 an element that you can't break it down any further than that.

1:36:11.500 --> 1:36:13.460
 Like there is suffering, this is truth.

1:36:13.460 --> 1:36:16.860
 So if you think, you know, and again,

1:36:16.860 --> 1:36:19.900
 assigning like good or bad to truth,

1:36:19.900 --> 1:36:23.220
 I think maybe there's more of a sort of neutrality there.

1:36:23.220 --> 1:36:24.780
 It's just what it is.

1:36:24.780 --> 1:36:25.620
 It's truth.

1:36:25.620 --> 1:36:27.900
 I mean, is it any, is it basically,

1:36:27.900 --> 1:36:32.900
 is suffering any disturbance from stillness?

1:36:33.740 --> 1:36:35.220
 Is suffering then?

1:36:35.220 --> 1:36:39.180
 Like basically any, anything that happens in life that,

1:36:41.140 --> 1:36:44.020
 that's like, that perturbs the system.

1:36:44.020 --> 1:36:45.380
 Ripples in the empty. Ripples.

1:36:45.380 --> 1:36:46.220
 Ripples, yeah.

1:36:46.220 --> 1:36:49.660
 So a still lake is empty of suffering,

1:36:49.660 --> 1:36:54.300
 but any kind of ripple is suffering in that sense.

1:36:54.300 --> 1:36:56.820
 A still lake is empty of suffering.

1:36:56.820 --> 1:36:58.420
 You sound like a Zen master.

1:36:58.420 --> 1:36:59.860
 It seems like something a Zen master might say.

1:36:59.860 --> 1:37:01.900
 If I can just grow a beard like yours.

1:37:01.900 --> 1:37:03.700
 Ah, no, the beard doesn't help.

1:37:03.700 --> 1:37:04.540
 We would, we would.

1:37:04.540 --> 1:37:07.020
 If I had your chin, you think I'd have a fucking beard?

1:37:07.020 --> 1:37:08.580
 I look like a stork.

1:37:08.580 --> 1:37:09.420
 You should see me.

1:37:09.420 --> 1:37:11.180
 If I had your chin, there'd be no beard here.

1:37:11.180 --> 1:37:13.260
 You have a symmetrical, nice chin.

1:37:13.260 --> 1:37:16.060
 This is the closest I can come to plastic surgery.

1:37:16.060 --> 1:37:18.100
 Pubic plastic surgery, friend.

1:37:19.100 --> 1:37:21.700
 That's how you know you're a professional comedian.

1:37:23.220 --> 1:37:24.300
 Yeah, so suffering.

1:37:24.300 --> 1:37:26.020
 There is suffering.

1:37:26.020 --> 1:37:30.740
 And the lake analogy is pretty good because the,

1:37:30.740 --> 1:37:35.740
 um, what's happening here is that,

1:37:36.260 --> 1:37:40.220
 that we have become identified

1:37:40.220 --> 1:37:42.540
 with something that we call a self.

1:37:42.540 --> 1:37:45.220
 So this, the self is just accepted.

1:37:45.220 --> 1:37:46.780
 I have a self, I have an identity,

1:37:46.780 --> 1:37:48.940
 I'm a person, I have a self.

1:37:48.940 --> 1:37:53.940
 But when you start doing scans to try to find yourself,

1:37:55.540 --> 1:37:56.980
 which is the entire thing.

1:37:56.980 --> 1:37:59.140
 I'm going to find myself.

1:37:59.140 --> 1:38:02.020
 You get in a van, go to California, take some acid,

1:38:02.020 --> 1:38:04.740
 fuck a prostitute on the bus or whatever Kerouac did.

1:38:04.740 --> 1:38:05.580
 Too far?

1:38:05.580 --> 1:38:06.420
 I'm going to find myself.

1:38:06.420 --> 1:38:08.180
 Oh, he didn't, she wasn't a prostitute,

1:38:08.180 --> 1:38:09.460
 just to correct the record.

1:38:09.460 --> 1:38:10.540
 Oh, previously a prostitute.

1:38:10.540 --> 1:38:12.260
 I guess once a prostitute, always a prostitute.

1:38:12.260 --> 1:38:13.100
 You know what?

1:38:13.100 --> 1:38:13.940
 She's a former prostitute.

1:38:13.940 --> 1:38:14.780
 I don't think that.

1:38:14.780 --> 1:38:18.020
 No, and look, I'm not, I'm not a sign,

1:38:18.020 --> 1:38:21.300
 look, all I'm saying is, uh, I don't care.

1:38:21.300 --> 1:38:22.140
 Who cares?

1:38:22.140 --> 1:38:22.980
 Who has a bit of prostitute?

1:38:22.980 --> 1:38:23.980
 God, I used to be one of them.

1:38:23.980 --> 1:38:26.980
 We're all kind of a kind of prostitute.

1:38:26.980 --> 1:38:28.780
 Yeah, yes, yes.

1:38:28.780 --> 1:38:29.620
 But the.

1:38:29.620 --> 1:38:32.940
 We make love and we make money.

1:38:32.940 --> 1:38:35.500
 Therefore, we're all a kind of prostitute.

1:38:35.500 --> 1:38:37.260
 We make, God, how great.

1:38:37.260 --> 1:38:40.740
 I would really love to be able to make money by fucking.

1:38:40.740 --> 1:38:44.180
 I mean, it's maybe not directly, but in some sense.

1:38:44.180 --> 1:38:45.020
 Directly.

1:38:45.020 --> 1:38:45.860
 Oh.

1:38:45.860 --> 1:38:46.700
 Yeah.

1:38:46.700 --> 1:38:50.220
 Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1:38:50.220 --> 1:38:51.460
 Do you accept Venmo or?

1:38:51.460 --> 1:38:53.500
 Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1:38:53.500 --> 1:38:55.100
 It's never too late to start.

1:38:55.100 --> 1:38:57.460
 That's so, sort of one of the ways in

1:38:57.460 --> 1:39:00.980
 is this sort of contemplation of the identity,

1:39:00.980 --> 1:39:04.260
 because it's like, uh, you know, what is,

1:39:04.260 --> 1:39:07.180
 it's not just the desire, it's what is having the desire?

1:39:07.180 --> 1:39:08.900
 Where, where does the desire live in?

1:39:08.900 --> 1:39:11.580
 Like, what doesn't want to be where it's at?

1:39:11.580 --> 1:39:15.620
 What is the thing that is like desperately wanting

1:39:15.620 --> 1:39:17.780
 to get out of the situation it's in?

1:39:17.780 --> 1:39:21.180
 And then, um, as far as ignorance, uh,

1:39:21.180 --> 1:39:24.420
 it's still something that's theoretically happening

1:39:24.420 --> 1:39:25.660
 to an identity.

1:39:25.660 --> 1:39:30.500
 So, so wrapped up in it is really just this sort of like,

1:39:30.500 --> 1:39:34.500
 and that's where we run into what, uh, into attachment.

1:39:34.500 --> 1:39:37.260
 So if, if the first noble truth of Buddhism

1:39:37.260 --> 1:39:39.060
 is there is suffering,

1:39:39.060 --> 1:39:42.060
 the second noble truth of Buddhism is, um,

1:39:42.060 --> 1:39:47.060
 the cause of this suffering is attachment.

1:39:47.460 --> 1:39:50.940
 And so people hear that and they take it, that's a,

1:39:50.940 --> 1:39:53.300
 there's a lot of levels to that concept.

1:39:53.300 --> 1:39:55.100
 Definitely the cause of suffering is attachment.

1:39:55.100 --> 1:39:57.740
 Like, God, I just got addicted to vapes.

1:39:57.740 --> 1:40:01.420
 Is there a more embarrassing addiction than vapes?

1:40:01.420 --> 1:40:03.580
 I'm smoking like a little purple thing.

1:40:03.580 --> 1:40:05.260
 It tastes like sugar.

1:40:05.260 --> 1:40:06.100
 It's attachment.

1:40:06.100 --> 1:40:08.020
 It is, there is suffering.

1:40:08.020 --> 1:40:09.020
 I want it.

1:40:09.020 --> 1:40:10.460
 I have to charge it now.

1:40:10.460 --> 1:40:11.900
 I'm embarrassed by it.

1:40:11.900 --> 1:40:13.580
 It makes me feel out of control.

1:40:13.580 --> 1:40:14.540
 There's a lot of suffering,

1:40:14.540 --> 1:40:18.540
 but also there's deeper levels of attachment

1:40:18.540 --> 1:40:21.460
 that go all the way to this attachment

1:40:21.460 --> 1:40:24.980
 to the sense of one's self.

1:40:24.980 --> 1:40:28.820
 And I think the existentialists do get into this idea

1:40:28.820 --> 1:40:30.660
 in a different way, which is like,

1:40:30.660 --> 1:40:32.500
 because I think I'm a me,

1:40:32.500 --> 1:40:37.260
 now I have to push what that thing is out into the world

1:40:37.260 --> 1:40:38.580
 through my actions.

1:40:38.580 --> 1:40:40.580
 And that's a kind of attachment too.

1:40:40.580 --> 1:40:41.420
 Exactly.

1:40:41.420 --> 1:40:42.260
 There you go.

1:40:42.260 --> 1:40:43.100
 Right.

1:40:43.100 --> 1:40:44.980
 And that leads to the third noble truth,

1:40:44.980 --> 1:40:49.460
 which is get rid of attachment

1:40:49.460 --> 1:40:51.220
 and you won't suffer anymore.

1:40:51.220 --> 1:40:53.580
 Uh, that's, it seems logical,

1:40:53.580 --> 1:40:55.380
 but you know, it is a very,

1:40:55.380 --> 1:40:57.260
 it is a mathematical analysis

1:40:57.260 --> 1:41:01.500
 of this particular problem of suffering it's addressing.

1:41:01.500 --> 1:41:03.180
 And then the fourth noble truth

1:41:03.180 --> 1:41:04.860
 is the eightfold path of Buddhism,

1:41:04.860 --> 1:41:09.860
 which is like a process by which one could unencumber oneself

1:41:11.700 --> 1:41:15.180
 from this identification with something that isn't real.

1:41:16.220 --> 1:41:17.700
 Do you need a bathroom break?

1:41:17.700 --> 1:41:18.540
 Yeah.

1:41:18.540 --> 1:41:19.380
 Thank you.

1:41:19.380 --> 1:41:20.200
 I do.

1:41:20.200 --> 1:41:21.900
 I appreciate that.

1:41:21.900 --> 1:41:24.180
 There's a funny moment, I was running in the heat yesterday

1:41:24.180 --> 1:41:27.020
 listening to Gulag Archipelago.

1:41:27.020 --> 1:41:30.620
 And there's a, which was a very welcome break

1:41:30.620 --> 1:41:34.020
 because I'm looking for any excuse to stop whatsoever.

1:41:34.020 --> 1:41:37.140
 The gentleman, very nice gentleman stopped me saying,

1:41:37.140 --> 1:41:40.020
 recognized me and just said a bunch of friendly things.

1:41:40.020 --> 1:41:43.320
 And then he mentioned as one of the people

1:41:43.320 --> 1:41:46.300
 who really inspires him is Duncan Trussell.

1:41:46.300 --> 1:41:51.300
 And I was, I mean, I'm the same way and I told him,

1:41:52.980 --> 1:41:56.260
 you know, tomorrow, it felt like a name drop.

1:41:56.260 --> 1:41:58.220
 I name dropped you this morning.

1:41:58.220 --> 1:42:00.220
 I was like, tomorrow I'm going to get to meet him.

1:42:00.220 --> 1:42:01.900
 So he says, he says, hi.

1:42:01.900 --> 1:42:05.940
 And there's, oh, and he said that he watched

1:42:05.940 --> 1:42:08.820
 Midnight Gospel on mushrooms.

1:42:08.820 --> 1:42:10.940
 And it was like the greatest mushroom experience

1:42:10.940 --> 1:42:11.780
 of his life.

1:42:11.780 --> 1:42:13.220
 I don't know.

1:42:13.220 --> 1:42:14.060
 Yeah, man.

1:42:14.060 --> 1:42:15.980
 Yeah, I was nervous about meeting you, man.

1:42:15.980 --> 1:42:17.340
 Like I have so much respect for you.

1:42:17.340 --> 1:42:18.780
 And like, oh yeah, I name dropped.

1:42:18.780 --> 1:42:21.700
 I was saying I'm going on Lex's podcast today.

1:42:21.700 --> 1:42:24.300
 It's, you look, we're so lucky we all live here.

1:42:24.300 --> 1:42:25.140
 What the fuck?

1:42:25.140 --> 1:42:26.380
 We're all living in Austin together.

1:42:26.380 --> 1:42:30.340
 Like I, I somehow like missed that,

1:42:30.340 --> 1:42:32.580
 but that's, we all got to hang out.

1:42:32.580 --> 1:42:34.780
 We all have to like start doing stuff.

1:42:34.780 --> 1:42:35.620
 Well, you have to really,

1:42:35.620 --> 1:42:37.260
 also you have to appreciate this moment.

1:42:37.260 --> 1:42:42.260
 I remember, I know some people are less sentimental

1:42:42.260 --> 1:42:47.260
 than others, but I remember sitting with Joe Rogan

1:42:49.460 --> 1:42:52.420
 and with Eric Weinstein, I believe it was.

1:42:52.420 --> 1:42:53.260
 Yeah.

1:42:53.260 --> 1:42:55.180
 And at the back of the comedy store

1:42:56.380 --> 1:42:58.220
 shortly before COVID, I think.

1:42:59.460 --> 1:43:01.140
 And just thinking like,

1:43:01.140 --> 1:43:04.340
 there's no way these things will last.

1:43:04.340 --> 1:43:07.660
 And these things meaning the comedy store,

1:43:07.660 --> 1:43:10.980
 Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan, the Joe Rogan,

1:43:10.980 --> 1:43:14.900
 like a, like a pocket influential podcasting person.

1:43:14.900 --> 1:43:19.900
 Also a person like in this room, in this space,

1:43:21.500 --> 1:43:24.340
 the ability to just talk for hours

1:43:24.340 --> 1:43:26.380
 and lose ourselves in this moment.

1:43:26.380 --> 1:43:30.700
 It just felt ephemeral, somehow temporary.

1:43:30.700 --> 1:43:32.740
 And I just wanted to capture that moment somehow.

1:43:32.740 --> 1:43:34.100
 Like, I don't know.

1:43:34.100 --> 1:43:36.580
 Sometimes that's where the temptation to take a picture

1:43:36.580 --> 1:43:37.500
 and you're that kind of stuff

1:43:37.500 --> 1:43:39.740
 or record a podcast comes from.

1:43:39.740 --> 1:43:43.100
 But it just felt like it would be, it'd be gone forever.

1:43:43.100 --> 1:43:45.420
 Of course, Joe doesn't seem to have

1:43:45.420 --> 1:43:47.460
 that kind of sentimental.

1:43:47.460 --> 1:43:48.420
 No, sure, no, no.

1:43:48.420 --> 1:43:49.620
 Just wherever you end up,

1:43:49.620 --> 1:43:51.060
 you just enjoy the shit out of it.

1:43:51.060 --> 1:43:52.060
 Right.

1:43:52.060 --> 1:43:52.900
 That's it.

1:43:52.900 --> 1:43:54.620
 Well, and that's something you have to cultivate.

1:43:54.620 --> 1:43:56.100
 You don't, that's not an easy,

1:43:56.100 --> 1:43:58.580
 the thing you're talking about, you know,

1:43:58.580 --> 1:44:00.500
 God, have you seen these?

1:44:00.500 --> 1:44:03.020
 I think the best analogy for what you're talking about,

1:44:03.020 --> 1:44:05.420
 there's these videos where people give like a sugar cube

1:44:05.420 --> 1:44:09.340
 to a raccoon, but the raccoons, they wash their food.

1:44:09.340 --> 1:44:11.260
 So raccoon, or I think it's cotton candy.

1:44:11.260 --> 1:44:12.620
 They give the raccoon cotton candy,

1:44:12.620 --> 1:44:14.900
 immediately it washes the cotton candy.

1:44:14.900 --> 1:44:17.380
 And of course the cotton candy dissolves in the water.

1:44:17.380 --> 1:44:20.260
 And the raccoon is like, what the fuck?

1:44:20.260 --> 1:44:22.820
 Like, you know, and the thing you're,

1:44:22.820 --> 1:44:24.340
 that grasping you're talking about,

1:44:24.340 --> 1:44:26.620
 it's like the raccoon washing the cotton candy.

1:44:26.620 --> 1:44:29.780
 Like the moment you get into the grasping part,

1:44:29.780 --> 1:44:34.780
 you paradoxically have pulled yourself out of the moment

1:44:35.260 --> 1:44:37.820
 that inspired the grasping part.

1:44:37.820 --> 1:44:40.140
 And that's, you know, that's some people,

1:44:40.140 --> 1:44:43.340
 that's the entirety of their lives trying to record.

1:44:43.340 --> 1:44:46.460
 I mean, Jesus, man, you ever see people film fireworks

1:44:46.460 --> 1:44:48.380
 on the 4th of July with their phone?

1:44:48.380 --> 1:44:52.620
 It's one of the most remarkable aspects of human behavior,

1:44:52.620 --> 1:44:55.900
 which is like, you know they're not gonna watch

1:44:55.900 --> 1:44:59.140
 the fireworks on their phone.

1:44:59.140 --> 1:45:00.580
 Only a lunatic would do that.

1:45:00.580 --> 1:45:04.100
 Like who's gonna go back and look at fireworks, but.

1:45:04.100 --> 1:45:06.580
 So, but we're also in this position where,

1:45:06.580 --> 1:45:08.860
 because of podcasting, there is some aspect

1:45:08.860 --> 1:45:11.780
 where you can record a magical moment in time

1:45:11.780 --> 1:45:15.940
 together between two people, or even just with a camera.

1:45:15.940 --> 1:45:19.420
 So to get back to the lake that you were talking about,

1:45:19.420 --> 1:45:20.260
 this is emptiness.

1:45:20.260 --> 1:45:21.180
 So that's emptiness.

1:45:21.180 --> 1:45:22.340
 That's what's known as emptiness.

1:45:22.340 --> 1:45:23.820
 The lake is emptiness.

1:45:23.820 --> 1:45:26.780
 And that's what we are, emptiness, emptiness.

1:45:26.780 --> 1:45:28.980
 And that's another thing that gets very confused

1:45:28.980 --> 1:45:32.420
 in Buddhism is that emptiness.

1:45:32.420 --> 1:45:35.820
 And that emptiness is, that's to me,

1:45:35.820 --> 1:45:39.820
 like when I'm going to do a podcast,

1:45:39.820 --> 1:45:40.900
 that's where I try to go.

1:45:40.900 --> 1:45:44.340
 I try to go just in the moment, no agenda.

1:45:44.340 --> 1:45:46.140
 You know, if I am nervous or whatever,

1:45:46.140 --> 1:45:47.540
 okay, I'll feel the nervousness,

1:45:47.540 --> 1:45:50.100
 but just in the, just drop into the moment.

1:45:50.100 --> 1:45:52.060
 That's when time changes.

1:45:52.060 --> 1:45:54.340
 And then you look up, hours have passed.

1:45:54.340 --> 1:45:55.540
 It feels like a second.

1:45:55.540 --> 1:45:57.100
 And the reason it feels like that is

1:45:57.100 --> 1:46:01.500
 because if you successfully dropped into the moment,

1:46:01.500 --> 1:46:05.060
 it's the lake now, it's emptiness.

1:46:05.060 --> 1:46:06.420
 It's forever for a second.

1:46:06.420 --> 1:46:09.100
 You're like, you're dipping into eternity.

1:46:09.100 --> 1:46:13.180
 And yeah, it's a very strange thing

1:46:13.180 --> 1:46:16.900
 to, as part of that, record it, you know,

1:46:16.900 --> 1:46:18.740
 as part of that, try to like grab it

1:46:18.740 --> 1:46:21.660
 and put it out there, but it works.

1:46:21.660 --> 1:46:26.220
 Can you speak to that, to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour?

1:46:26.220 --> 1:46:30.220
 Can you speak about that purple lavender world you go to

1:46:30.220 --> 1:46:33.100
 when it's most intense and successful for you,

1:46:33.100 --> 1:46:36.020
 when you feel a sense of lightness and happiness

1:46:36.020 --> 1:46:39.100
 when it works, whether it's your own

1:46:39.100 --> 1:46:41.700
 or a conversation with Joe in general,

1:46:41.700 --> 1:46:44.860
 or is, well, yours is very specific

1:46:44.860 --> 1:46:45.980
 because it's audio only.

1:46:45.980 --> 1:46:47.460
 Maybe you can also speak to that.

1:46:47.460 --> 1:46:50.500
 Because you might as well be naked

1:46:50.500 --> 1:46:52.580
 or you don't have to, you have to,

1:46:52.580 --> 1:46:56.000
 you're free of the conventions of the real world.

1:46:56.900 --> 1:47:01.060
 I will never stop thinking it's remarkable.

1:47:01.060 --> 1:47:04.060
 Like the fact that I'm talking to you, to me,

1:47:04.060 --> 1:47:06.920
 seems remarkable, not just technologically,

1:47:06.920 --> 1:47:09.640
 but I'm talking to someone,

1:47:09.640 --> 1:47:11.380
 I'm assuming I'm allowed to say this,

1:47:11.380 --> 1:47:15.620
 who has robot dogs that I've been watching

1:47:15.620 --> 1:47:18.860
 for years evolve on YouTube.

1:47:20.060 --> 1:47:22.540
 Arms reach away from one of these things, you know?

1:47:22.540 --> 1:47:27.540
 And I'm with somebody who is like an acclaimed genius.

1:47:27.700 --> 1:47:30.180
 So for me, it's like, oh my God,

1:47:30.180 --> 1:47:33.580
 how's, what, why do I get to have this conversation?

1:47:33.580 --> 1:47:34.860
 Why do I get to be here?

1:47:34.860 --> 1:47:36.660
 When there'd be like a line,

1:47:36.660 --> 1:47:38.660
 there'd be a line that would just wrapped

1:47:38.660 --> 1:47:40.580
 and wrapped and wrapped around this building

1:47:40.580 --> 1:47:43.180
 of people who'd love a chance to just chat with you.

1:47:43.180 --> 1:47:45.540
 And so when I, with my podcast,

1:47:45.540 --> 1:47:49.300
 that's how I feel like when I'm talking to these guests,

1:47:49.300 --> 1:47:53.300
 you know, who have spent, you know,

1:47:53.300 --> 1:47:56.940
 some of them have like spent their entire lifetime

1:47:56.940 --> 1:48:01.940
 meditating, you know, studying specific aspects of Buddhism

1:48:02.300 --> 1:48:04.180
 or even when I'm with, you know,

1:48:04.180 --> 1:48:07.580
 when I'm with comedians who I like consider

1:48:07.580 --> 1:48:08.860
 to be brilliantly funny.

1:48:08.860 --> 1:48:13.460
 So for me, it's just like, God, I almost feel like

1:48:13.460 --> 1:48:17.100
 I've just created some sophisticated trap for cool people

1:48:17.100 --> 1:48:19.140
 where like I get to like hang out with them.

1:48:19.140 --> 1:48:21.740
 So you're like sitting in the gratitude of it,

1:48:21.740 --> 1:48:23.420
 just feeling lucky.

1:48:23.420 --> 1:48:25.260
 Yeah, yeah, feeling lucky

1:48:25.260 --> 1:48:27.380
 and wrestling with imposter syndrome, you know,

1:48:27.380 --> 1:48:28.820
 trying to like get that part of myself

1:48:28.820 --> 1:48:31.540
 to shut up long enough so I could be in that moment

1:48:31.540 --> 1:48:33.380
 that we're talking about, you know?

1:48:33.380 --> 1:48:36.020
 And then I carry that with me.

1:48:36.020 --> 1:48:38.460
 It's not just like you stop the podcast.

1:48:38.460 --> 1:48:41.580
 It's like some of the things these people tell me

1:48:41.580 --> 1:48:45.140
 or some of the ways they are, like it becomes part of me.

1:48:45.140 --> 1:48:48.220
 And then I get to have a life or this thing

1:48:48.220 --> 1:48:52.020
 that they gave me is in me forever.

1:48:52.020 --> 1:48:54.380
 And so, yeah, it's, there's...

1:48:54.380 --> 1:48:56.900
 Yeah, it's cool how conversation can just,

1:48:56.900 --> 1:49:01.020
 a few sentences can change the direction of your life.

1:49:01.020 --> 1:49:01.860
 If you're listening,

1:49:01.860 --> 1:49:05.260
 if you're there to be transformed by the words,

1:49:05.260 --> 1:49:06.580
 they will do the work.

1:49:06.580 --> 1:49:09.860
 It's, and it's the full mix of it.

1:49:09.860 --> 1:49:14.180
 It's usually when, if you look up to somebody,

1:49:15.300 --> 1:49:17.020
 and it's true for me at least,

1:49:17.020 --> 1:49:19.220
 I think it is for you that you start to look up

1:49:19.220 --> 1:49:20.980
 to basically everybody you talk to.

1:49:20.980 --> 1:49:23.780
 Yes, yes, good sign.

1:49:23.780 --> 1:49:24.940
 That's a good sign.

1:49:24.940 --> 1:49:26.860
 God forbid it goes the other way.

1:49:26.860 --> 1:49:27.940
 You're in trouble.

1:49:27.940 --> 1:49:30.540
 If all of a sudden you start looking down on people,

1:49:30.540 --> 1:49:34.260
 because whatever crazy metric you're using,

1:49:34.260 --> 1:49:35.900
 ooh, that would freak me out.

1:49:35.900 --> 1:49:38.140
 I do feel like that's a quality of getting older.

1:49:38.140 --> 1:49:41.940
 When I was younger, I really, like, I thought I was so smart.

1:49:41.940 --> 1:49:43.340
 Like I thought I had it all figured out.

1:49:43.340 --> 1:49:44.180
 Oh, really?

1:49:44.180 --> 1:49:46.580
 So you're going, your ego is just going,

1:49:46.580 --> 1:49:47.780
 taking a nose dive.

1:49:47.780 --> 1:49:50.820
 I would like to say it's my ego taking a nose dive.

1:49:50.820 --> 1:49:52.380
 Me and my friend talk about it a bunch.

1:49:52.380 --> 1:49:55.940
 We've just always associated it with like doing acid

1:49:55.940 --> 1:49:57.620
 for two decades straight.

1:49:57.620 --> 1:50:00.740
 Like, I'm gonna just assume I'm just like slowly

1:50:00.740 --> 1:50:02.940
 like spiraling into senility, you know?

1:50:02.940 --> 1:50:06.780
 Like, I'm just like, all the confidence,

1:50:06.780 --> 1:50:08.860
 all the like, oh, the certainty when you're having,

1:50:08.860 --> 1:50:11.380
 like in college, having the great,

1:50:11.380 --> 1:50:16.380
 oh, like, you know, you feel like you're a representative

1:50:17.300 --> 1:50:18.620
 of Camus or some shit.

1:50:18.620 --> 1:50:19.460
 You know what I mean?

1:50:19.460 --> 1:50:20.660
 You read the myth of Sisyphus,

1:50:20.660 --> 1:50:23.780
 and now you like it, know all existentialism

1:50:23.780 --> 1:50:27.620
 and your certainty in regards to it is embarrassing,

1:50:27.620 --> 1:50:29.660
 but you don't see it in that way.

1:50:29.660 --> 1:50:30.580
 You just feel certain.

1:50:30.580 --> 1:50:33.700
 And then that certainty, it just starts like,

1:50:33.700 --> 1:50:35.900
 it starts crumbling a little bit.

1:50:35.900 --> 1:50:37.820
 And then, yeah.

1:50:37.820 --> 1:50:41.420
 You know, I get to actually intensely experience

1:50:41.420 --> 1:50:43.900
 that certainty in many communities,

1:50:43.900 --> 1:50:46.340
 but one in cryptocurrency.

1:50:46.340 --> 1:50:49.980
 Young folks with the certainty that this technology

1:50:49.980 --> 1:50:51.820
 will transform the world.

1:50:51.820 --> 1:50:54.820
 And I mean, this is almost one of the big communities

1:50:54.820 --> 1:50:57.780
 of the modern era where they believe

1:50:57.780 --> 1:51:00.380
 that this will really solve so many of the problems

1:51:00.380 --> 1:51:03.420
 of the world, and they believe in it very intensely.

1:51:03.420 --> 1:51:06.780
 And aside from the technology and the details of the thing,

1:51:06.780 --> 1:51:09.980
 all I see is the certainty and the passion in their eyes.

1:51:09.980 --> 1:51:11.100
 They'll stop me.

1:51:11.100 --> 1:51:15.660
 Let me explain you, let me just give me a chance

1:51:15.660 --> 1:51:19.140
 to tell you why this thing is extremely powerful.

1:51:19.140 --> 1:51:21.700
 And I just get to enjoy the glow of that,

1:51:21.700 --> 1:51:26.140
 because it's like, wow, I miss having that certainty

1:51:26.140 --> 1:51:27.580
 about anything.

1:51:27.580 --> 1:51:29.860
 It's probably come over for me too.

1:51:29.860 --> 1:51:32.100
 But when I was younger, it's like,

1:51:32.100 --> 1:51:37.100
 only I deeply understand the relationship of man

1:51:38.700 --> 1:51:40.300
 to his mortality.

1:51:40.300 --> 1:51:42.380
 And I understood that most deeply, I think,

1:51:42.380 --> 1:51:44.300
 when I was like 16 or 17.

1:51:44.300 --> 1:51:48.260
 And I am the representative of the human condition.

1:51:48.260 --> 1:51:52.300
 And all these adults with their busyness of day to day life

1:51:52.300 --> 1:51:55.620
 and their concerns, they don't deeply understand

1:51:55.620 --> 1:51:58.500
 what I understand, which is the only thing that matters

1:51:59.700 --> 1:52:03.780
 is the absurdity of the human condition.

1:52:03.780 --> 1:52:05.300
 Yeah, yeah.

1:52:05.300 --> 1:52:07.540
 And let me quote you some Dostoevsky.

1:52:07.540 --> 1:52:10.220
 Oh boy, and you speak Russian.

1:52:10.220 --> 1:52:11.060
 Yes, I speak Russian.

1:52:11.060 --> 1:52:13.620
 So you've read the Brothers Karamazov in Russian.

1:52:13.620 --> 1:52:18.380
 Unfortunately, I have to admit that I read

1:52:18.380 --> 1:52:20.460
 all of the Dostoevsky in English.

1:52:22.660 --> 1:52:25.500
 I came to this country when I was 13.

1:52:25.500 --> 1:52:27.380
 And at least don't remember, we read a lot,

1:52:27.380 --> 1:52:32.340
 but we read Tolstoy, Pushkin, a lot of the Russian literature

1:52:32.340 --> 1:52:34.060
 but it was in Russian.

1:52:34.060 --> 1:52:35.620
 But I don't remember reading Dostoevsky.

1:52:35.620 --> 1:52:39.780
 I wonder at which point does the Russian education system

1:52:39.780 --> 1:52:41.300
 give you Dostoevsky?

1:52:41.300 --> 1:52:43.220
 Because it's pretty heavy stuff.

1:52:43.220 --> 1:52:45.820
 Second grade, it's probably the second grade.

1:52:45.820 --> 1:52:47.500
 Russians are intense.

1:52:47.500 --> 1:52:50.140
 Yes, they are, they very much are.

1:52:50.140 --> 1:52:51.540
 I don't remember reading Dostoevsky,

1:52:51.540 --> 1:52:56.100
 but I did tangent upon a tangent upon a tangent.

1:52:56.100 --> 1:52:59.300
 I traveled to Paris recently on the way to Ukraine

1:53:00.780 --> 1:53:04.900
 and was scheduled to talk to Richard Pevere

1:53:04.900 --> 1:53:09.900
 and this pair that translate Dostoevsky, Tolstoy,

1:53:09.900 --> 1:53:13.060
 just this famous pair that translate

1:53:13.060 --> 1:53:14.900
 most of Russian literature to English.

1:53:14.900 --> 1:53:19.900
 And I was planning to have a sequence of five, 10,

1:53:20.340 --> 1:53:23.020
 15 hour conversation with them about the different details

1:53:23.020 --> 1:53:25.500
 of all the translations and so on.

1:53:25.500 --> 1:53:28.620
 I just found myself in a very dark place mentally

1:53:28.620 --> 1:53:31.140
 where I couldn't think about podcasts or anything like that.

1:53:31.140 --> 1:53:32.780
 It caught me off guard.

1:53:32.780 --> 1:53:36.140
 So I went to Paris and just laid there for a day.

1:53:36.140 --> 1:53:40.220
 Not just being stressed about Ukraine and all those kinds

1:53:40.220 --> 1:53:44.820
 of things, but I'm still, the act of translation

1:53:44.820 --> 1:53:49.420
 is such a fascinating way to approach some of the deepest

1:53:49.420 --> 1:53:51.540
 questions that this literature raises,

1:53:51.540 --> 1:53:56.460
 which is like, how do I capture the essence of a sentence

1:53:56.460 --> 1:53:58.420
 that has so much power and translate it

1:53:58.420 --> 1:53:59.820
 into another language?

1:53:59.820 --> 1:54:01.820
 That act is actually really, really interesting.

1:54:01.820 --> 1:54:05.660
 And I found with my conversations with them,

1:54:05.660 --> 1:54:09.220
 they've really thought through this stuff.

1:54:09.220 --> 1:54:10.700
 It's not just about language,

1:54:10.700 --> 1:54:12.580
 it's about the ideas in those books.

1:54:12.580 --> 1:54:15.900
 And that also really makes me sad

1:54:15.900 --> 1:54:18.260
 because I wonder how much is lost in translation.

1:54:18.260 --> 1:54:22.580
 I'm currently, so when I was in Ukraine,

1:54:22.580 --> 1:54:26.540
 I talked to a lot of, like half the conversations I had

1:54:26.540 --> 1:54:29.260
 on the record were in Russian,

1:54:29.260 --> 1:54:34.260
 and basically 100% of the record were in Russian

1:54:34.260 --> 1:54:36.260
 in Russian versus in English.

1:54:37.260 --> 1:54:40.820
 And just so much is lost in those languages.

1:54:40.820 --> 1:54:44.460
 And I'm now struggling because I'm launching

1:54:44.460 --> 1:54:47.940
 a Russian channel where there'll be a Russian

1:54:47.940 --> 1:54:49.300
 overdub of Duncan.

1:54:49.300 --> 1:54:50.740
 Wow.

1:54:50.740 --> 1:54:53.340
 Your wow will now be translated into Russian.

1:54:53.340 --> 1:54:55.060
 What's Russian wow?

1:54:55.060 --> 1:54:57.500
 I don't, it'll just be wow probably.

1:54:57.500 --> 1:54:59.700
 I'm so sorry for the difficulties

1:54:59.700 --> 1:55:01.100
 of having to translate wow.

1:55:01.100 --> 1:55:04.420
 Usually probably with wow they'll leave it unoverdubbed

1:55:04.420 --> 1:55:06.300
 because people understand exactly what you mean.

1:55:06.300 --> 1:55:09.420
 But that's an art form, and it's a weird art form.

1:55:09.420 --> 1:55:14.420
 It's like how do you capture the chemistry,

1:55:15.220 --> 1:55:19.660
 the excitement, the, I don't know,

1:55:19.660 --> 1:55:24.660
 maybe the humor, the implied kind of wit.

1:55:25.540 --> 1:55:27.660
 I don't know, there's just layers of complexity

1:55:27.660 --> 1:55:30.820
 in language that it's very difficult to capture.

1:55:30.820 --> 1:55:33.460
 And I wonder how, it is sad for me

1:55:33.460 --> 1:55:36.100
 because I know Russian, how much is lost in translation.

1:55:36.100 --> 1:55:39.620
 And the same, there's a brewing conflict

1:55:39.620 --> 1:55:42.660
 and tension with China now, and so much is lost

1:55:42.660 --> 1:55:44.460
 in the translation between those languages.

1:55:44.460 --> 1:55:46.020
 Oh my God, yeah.

1:55:46.020 --> 1:55:50.700
 And cultures, the entire, the music of the people

1:55:50.700 --> 1:55:53.260
 is completely lost because we don't know the language,

1:55:53.260 --> 1:55:54.260
 or most of us don't know the language.

1:55:54.260 --> 1:55:55.780
 Yeah, how much of the conflict

1:55:55.780 --> 1:55:58.060
 is just problems in translation?

1:55:58.060 --> 1:56:00.700
 How much of all these problems that we're having

1:56:00.700 --> 1:56:02.620
 are just the alien sense of this or that?

1:56:02.620 --> 1:56:04.460
 It's just as simple as that.

1:56:04.460 --> 1:56:09.460
 Words are getting just a tiny warp away from the intent

1:56:13.060 --> 1:56:16.700
 of if, when we both speak the same language,

1:56:16.700 --> 1:56:20.540
 we can still say something that offends someone

1:56:20.540 --> 1:56:22.980
 when you never intended that at all.

1:56:22.980 --> 1:56:26.460
 How much more so when like it's,

1:56:26.460 --> 1:56:29.060
 not only is it a completely different sound,

1:56:29.060 --> 1:56:31.740
 but the script itself is different.

1:56:31.740 --> 1:56:35.260
 Like what is, the Russian writing,

1:56:35.260 --> 1:56:37.460
 is it called Cyrillic or what's the name?

1:56:37.460 --> 1:56:38.300
 Yeah, Cyrillic.

1:56:38.300 --> 1:56:41.140
 Cyrillic, and I don't know the name for Chinese writing,

1:56:41.140 --> 1:56:45.540
 but it's like, it's a continuum that like gets weirder

1:56:45.540 --> 1:56:47.100
 and weirder looking, you know?

1:56:47.100 --> 1:56:49.620
 Like it's, so yeah.

1:56:49.620 --> 1:56:51.540
 Or less weird depending on your perspective.

1:56:51.540 --> 1:56:54.340
 Yeah, I'm sure depending on where you're at.

1:56:54.340 --> 1:56:56.300
 You know, I'm definitely, I'm about the farthest thing

1:56:56.300 --> 1:56:58.300
 from a polyglot as there could be, man.

1:56:58.300 --> 1:57:01.060
 Like, but I'll tell you, at one point

1:57:01.060 --> 1:57:04.620
 when I was getting fascinated by Dostoevsky,

1:57:04.620 --> 1:57:07.220
 I did have this very transient fantasy

1:57:07.220 --> 1:57:10.820
 about learning Russian so that I could like understand

1:57:10.820 --> 1:57:12.380
 the difference and it's.

1:57:12.380 --> 1:57:14.780
 You were 17, 18 at the time.

1:57:14.780 --> 1:57:15.620
 College.

1:57:15.620 --> 1:57:16.460
 Yeah, college.

1:57:16.460 --> 1:57:18.900
 Yeah, Brothers Karamazov lost in that book.

1:57:18.900 --> 1:57:20.740
 Just like, oh God.

1:57:20.740 --> 1:57:24.700
 So in love with it is.

1:57:24.700 --> 1:57:29.580
 But there's definitely like, you know, Ukraine,

1:57:29.580 --> 1:57:32.340
 and this is what a lot of the war is about is saying,

1:57:32.340 --> 1:57:35.540
 you know, Ukraine and Russia are not the same people.

1:57:35.540 --> 1:57:37.020
 There's a strong culture in Ukraine,

1:57:37.020 --> 1:57:38.820
 there's a strong culture in Russia.

1:57:38.820 --> 1:57:41.660
 But you know, I know because that's where my family's from,

1:57:41.660 --> 1:57:45.940
 there is a fascinating, strong culture.

1:57:45.940 --> 1:57:50.140
 But there's such strong cultures everywhere else too.

1:57:50.140 --> 1:57:52.820
 Ireland has a culture, Scotland has a culture.

1:57:52.820 --> 1:57:56.180
 Even like on a tiny island, you just have these like,

1:57:56.180 --> 1:57:59.820
 subcultures that are more powerful than anything

1:57:59.820 --> 1:58:01.360
 existing in human history.

1:58:02.540 --> 1:58:05.460
 Like the Bronx, I don't know, like Brooklyn.

1:58:05.460 --> 1:58:07.620
 Like different parts of New York have a certain culture.

1:58:07.620 --> 1:58:10.260
 And then New York versus LA versus, well.

1:58:10.260 --> 1:58:12.860
 And then certain places are looking for their culture.

1:58:12.860 --> 1:58:17.580
 Like I don't, I think Austin, I don't know what Austin is.

1:58:17.580 --> 1:58:18.660
 And I don't think anyone knows.

1:58:18.660 --> 1:58:21.660
 There's a traditional Austin,

1:58:21.660 --> 1:58:23.580
 and then it's evolving constantly.

1:58:23.580 --> 1:58:26.440
 Same with Boston, a place I spent a lot of time.

1:58:26.440 --> 1:58:28.680
 There's a traditional Boston and now it's evolving

1:58:28.680 --> 1:58:32.940
 with the different younger people coming from university

1:58:32.940 --> 1:58:35.080
 and staying and all of that is evolving.

1:58:35.080 --> 1:58:37.260
 But underneath it, there's a core,

1:58:37.260 --> 1:58:40.180
 like the American ideal of the value of the individual,

1:58:40.180 --> 1:58:42.820
 the value of freedom, of freedom of speech,

1:58:42.820 --> 1:58:45.740
 all those kinds of things that permeates all of that.

1:58:45.740 --> 1:58:49.820
 And the same thing in the history of World War II

1:58:49.820 --> 1:58:54.560
 permeates Ukraine and Russia, a lot of parts of Europe,

1:58:54.560 --> 1:58:57.360
 the memories of all that suffering and destruction,

1:58:57.360 --> 1:58:59.340
 the broken promises of governments

1:58:59.340 --> 1:59:04.340
 and the occupier versus the liberator,

1:59:04.920 --> 1:59:06.300
 all that kind of stuff.

1:59:06.300 --> 1:59:08.060
 All that permeates the culture.

1:59:08.060 --> 1:59:12.100
 That affects how cynical or optimistic you are,

1:59:12.100 --> 1:59:16.140
 or how much you appreciate material possessions

1:59:16.140 --> 1:59:19.420
 versus human connection, all that kind of stuff.

1:59:19.420 --> 1:59:23.780
 Yeah, it's, I mean, this is like, talk about absurdity.

1:59:23.780 --> 1:59:26.100
 I mean, this is, war is like,

1:59:26.100 --> 1:59:28.380
 it's what absurdity looks like.

1:59:28.380 --> 1:59:32.380
 It's some kind of organized madness.

1:59:32.380 --> 1:59:34.300
 None of it makes sense, like all of it,

1:59:34.300 --> 1:59:37.260
 like it's just, none of it makes sense,

1:59:37.260 --> 1:59:38.500
 but it does, but it doesn't.

1:59:38.500 --> 1:59:40.220
 I mean, obviously you're defending yourself

1:59:40.220 --> 1:59:43.980
 or you're taking orders that if you don't take,

1:59:43.980 --> 1:59:45.180
 you're going to jail.

1:59:45.180 --> 1:59:47.780
 And so, or somewhere in between,

1:59:47.780 --> 1:59:50.380
 there's a classic story about this.

1:59:50.380 --> 1:59:53.540
 Maybe it's a bullshit myth about World War II.

1:59:53.540 --> 1:59:55.700
 I'm sure everyone's heard it because it comes up,

1:59:55.700 --> 2:00:00.700
 you know, it's Christmas Eve and they have a ceasefire.

2:00:01.080 --> 2:00:03.640
 And then I think they played soccer,

2:00:03.640 --> 2:00:05.000
 they sing Christmas songs,

2:00:05.000 --> 2:00:08.800
 and then they had to force them into fighting again.

2:00:08.800 --> 2:00:12.900
 And so when those moments happen, the,

2:00:12.900 --> 2:00:15.300
 are you familiar with Hakeem Bey?

2:00:15.300 --> 2:00:16.880
 He's a controversial figure.

2:00:16.880 --> 2:00:19.300
 Sadly, like he, like, I think he was like,

2:00:20.740 --> 2:00:21.680
 I'm not going to defame him

2:00:21.680 --> 2:00:24.020
 because I haven't like researched it correctly,

2:00:24.020 --> 2:00:25.060
 but some people have said shit,

2:00:25.060 --> 2:00:27.380
 but since I don't know the reference, I'm not going to.

2:00:27.380 --> 2:00:30.820
 But regardless, I mean, you know, look,

2:00:30.820 --> 2:00:32.900
 I'm sorry, but Bill Cosby was funny.

2:00:32.900 --> 2:00:36.540
 You know, like that's a funny comedian,

2:00:36.540 --> 2:00:40.180
 but you know the other stuff.

2:00:40.180 --> 2:00:43.580
 Michael Jackson, he could fucking dance.

2:00:43.580 --> 2:00:44.420
 And sing.

2:00:44.420 --> 2:00:46.260
 And sing, but there's some other stuff.

2:00:46.260 --> 2:00:50.180
 But regardless, Hakeem Bey came up with the idea

2:00:50.180 --> 2:00:53.860
 of something called a temporary autonomous zone,

2:00:53.860 --> 2:00:58.780
 which is that within a structure, a cultural structure,

2:00:58.780 --> 2:01:03.780
 a temporary bubble of freedom will appear

2:01:04.220 --> 2:01:09.220
 that by its nature gets sort of popped

2:01:09.420 --> 2:01:11.420
 by the bigger bubble,

2:01:11.420 --> 2:01:13.860
 or it runs out of resources generally is what happens.

2:01:13.860 --> 2:01:17.160
 So these things will appear just out of the blue

2:01:17.160 --> 2:01:22.160
 that it's almost like, imagine if like on earth

2:01:22.420 --> 2:01:25.120
 in some tiny little bit of earth,

2:01:25.120 --> 2:01:29.020
 the gravitational field was reduced by some percentage.

2:01:29.020 --> 2:01:31.380
 And all of a sudden you could jump really high or whatever,

2:01:31.380 --> 2:01:32.220
 but it wouldn't last.

2:01:32.220 --> 2:01:35.140
 It's like that culturally, all the restrictions

2:01:35.140 --> 2:01:37.280
 and the darkness and the heaviness and all of it

2:01:37.280 --> 2:01:40.180
 for a second, somehow this bubble appears

2:01:40.180 --> 2:01:45.180
 where humans come together as the hippie ideal.

2:01:45.900 --> 2:01:50.060
 Brothers, sisters, just humans, earthlings

2:01:50.060 --> 2:01:55.060
 instead of American, Chinese, Russian, Ukrainian

2:01:55.640 --> 2:01:58.440
 temporary autonomous zone, it gets crushed

2:01:58.440 --> 2:02:01.360
 by the default reality that it was appearing in.

2:02:01.360 --> 2:02:03.940
 But somehow within that space,

2:02:03.940 --> 2:02:08.500
 you witness the possibility, the possibility,

2:02:08.500 --> 2:02:12.020
 the frustrating possibility that anyone who's thought

2:02:12.020 --> 2:02:16.060
 about humanity knows this possibility,

2:02:16.060 --> 2:02:18.580
 which is like, it seems like we can just get along.

2:02:18.580 --> 2:02:21.420
 Like it does seem like we're pretty much the same thing

2:02:21.420 --> 2:02:23.660
 and that we can just get along.

2:02:23.660 --> 2:02:26.740
 Those moments are really rare.

2:02:26.740 --> 2:02:27.580
 It's sad.

2:02:27.580 --> 2:02:30.060
 I talked to a lot of soldiers, a lot of people

2:02:30.060 --> 2:02:35.060
 that suffered through the different aspects of that war.

2:02:35.060 --> 2:02:40.060
 Or war, and there's an information war

2:02:40.220 --> 2:02:44.260
 that convinces each side that the other

2:02:44.260 --> 2:02:47.380
 is not just the enemy, but less than human.

2:02:47.380 --> 2:02:48.220
 Right.

2:02:48.220 --> 2:02:52.180
 So there's a real hatred towards the other side.

2:02:52.180 --> 2:02:53.180
 Yeah.

2:02:53.180 --> 2:02:56.700
 And those kind of little moments where you realize,

2:02:56.700 --> 2:03:00.140
 oh, they're human like me.

2:03:00.140 --> 2:03:00.980
 Yeah.

2:03:00.980 --> 2:03:03.460
 And not just like human like me,

2:03:03.460 --> 2:03:06.500
 but they have the same values as me.

2:03:06.500 --> 2:03:11.500
 And this woman who was a really respected soldier,

2:03:13.980 --> 2:03:18.580
 she specializes in anti tank missiles.

2:03:18.580 --> 2:03:23.140
 And she's very kind of, very pragmatic,

2:03:23.140 --> 2:03:26.780
 very the enemy is the enemy, you have to destroy the enemy

2:03:26.780 --> 2:03:29.700
 and saying like, there's no compassion towards the enemy.

2:03:29.700 --> 2:03:31.540
 They're not human.

2:03:31.540 --> 2:03:33.700
 They're less than human.

2:03:33.700 --> 2:03:38.580
 But she said there was a moment when she remembers

2:03:38.580 --> 2:03:43.580
 an enemy soldier in a tank took a risk

2:03:43.700 --> 2:03:45.620
 to save a fellow soldier.

2:03:45.620 --> 2:03:48.220
 And that risk was really stupid because he was facing,

2:03:48.220 --> 2:03:50.020
 he was going to get destroyed.

2:03:50.020 --> 2:03:55.020
 And then she said that she tried to shoot a rocket

2:03:57.660 --> 2:03:59.940
 at that tank and she missed.

2:03:59.940 --> 2:04:02.340
 And then she later went home and she couldn't sleep

2:04:02.340 --> 2:04:03.180
 that she missed.

2:04:03.180 --> 2:04:05.180
 How could she screw that up?

2:04:05.180 --> 2:04:09.220
 But then she realized that actually she missed,

2:04:09.220 --> 2:04:10.780
 maybe she missed on purpose.

2:04:10.780 --> 2:04:11.620
 Yeah.

2:04:11.620 --> 2:04:16.620
 Because she realized that that man, just like she is,

2:04:16.820 --> 2:04:21.220
 was a hero, just like she strives to be.

2:04:21.220 --> 2:04:24.940
 They were both heroes defending their own.

2:04:24.940 --> 2:04:27.980
 And in that way, he was just like her.

2:04:27.980 --> 2:04:30.380
 She was like, that's the only time I remember during this

2:04:30.380 --> 2:04:33.580
 war ever feeling like this is another human being.

2:04:33.580 --> 2:04:36.540
 But that was a very brief moment for her.

2:04:36.540 --> 2:04:39.420
 And I just hear that over and over and over again.

2:04:39.420 --> 2:04:44.420
 These romantic notions we have of we're one,

2:04:44.460 --> 2:04:46.340
 that we're all just human.

2:04:46.340 --> 2:04:50.820
 Unfortunately during war, those notions are rare.

2:04:50.820 --> 2:04:51.780
 And it's quite sad.

2:04:51.780 --> 2:04:54.940
 And war in a certain way really destroys those notions.

2:04:54.940 --> 2:04:59.540
 And one of the saddest things is it destroys it,

2:05:01.020 --> 2:05:05.860
 at least from what I see, potentially for generations.

2:05:05.860 --> 2:05:08.220
 Not just for those people for the rest of their life,

2:05:08.220 --> 2:05:12.100
 but for their children, their children's children.

2:05:12.100 --> 2:05:13.780
 The hatred.

2:05:13.780 --> 2:05:16.060
 I mean, I ask that question of basically everyone,

2:05:16.060 --> 2:05:20.700
 which is will you ever forgive, asking of Ukrainians,

2:05:20.700 --> 2:05:22.860
 will you ever forgive the Russians?

2:05:22.860 --> 2:05:27.060
 Will, do you have hate in your heart towards the Russians?

2:05:27.060 --> 2:05:32.060
 Or do you have love for a fellow human being?

2:05:32.140 --> 2:05:36.580
 And there's different ways that people struggle with that.

2:05:36.580 --> 2:05:40.660
 Different people, they saw that, they saw the love,

2:05:40.660 --> 2:05:43.460
 they saw the hate with their known heart.

2:05:43.460 --> 2:05:45.380
 And they struggle with the hate they have.

2:05:45.380 --> 2:05:48.580
 And they know they can overcome it in a period of weeks

2:05:48.580 --> 2:05:50.820
 and months after the war is over.

2:05:50.820 --> 2:05:53.620
 But some people said, no, this hate that was,

2:05:53.620 --> 2:05:56.540
 that showed up in February when the war started

2:05:56.540 --> 2:05:57.820
 will be with me forever.

2:05:57.820 --> 2:06:00.220
 Well, yeah, their kids got killed.

2:06:00.220 --> 2:06:02.140
 What the fuck are you gonna do about that?

2:06:02.140 --> 2:06:02.980
 Like, I don't care.

2:06:02.980 --> 2:06:06.820
 I've got aphorisms and cute little stories about,

2:06:06.820 --> 2:06:10.140
 you're still in prison if you hate your former captors.

2:06:10.140 --> 2:06:14.220
 But man, I gotta tell you, if somebody hurt my kids,

2:06:14.220 --> 2:06:15.180
 I'm not coming back.

2:06:15.180 --> 2:06:18.140
 I mean, there's no amount,

2:06:18.140 --> 2:06:21.060
 at least right now in my approximation,

2:06:21.060 --> 2:06:24.860
 of spiritual literature, meditation,

2:06:24.860 --> 2:06:26.700
 or anything that I can really think of

2:06:26.700 --> 2:06:31.180
 that is going to give me that kind of space.

2:06:31.180 --> 2:06:34.420
 Like, I think I imagine in the same way like,

2:06:36.340 --> 2:06:39.060
 I imagine I could probably run a marathon eventually,

2:06:39.060 --> 2:06:42.700
 but do I think I'm ever gonna do that?

2:06:42.700 --> 2:06:44.100
 That times a million.

2:06:44.100 --> 2:06:47.900
 So man, all we can do is have compassion for their hate

2:06:47.900 --> 2:06:51.940
 because it's like, what are you gonna say?

2:06:51.940 --> 2:06:53.580
 What are you gonna say to someone like that?

2:06:53.580 --> 2:06:58.580
 Oh, oh, you know, for the sake of humanity, let it go.

2:06:58.780 --> 2:07:00.380
 It was just your kids.

2:07:00.380 --> 2:07:02.580
 It was just something you loved

2:07:02.580 --> 2:07:05.300
 more than anything in the world.

2:07:05.300 --> 2:07:07.060
 You'll never be okay again.

2:07:07.060 --> 2:07:09.380
 You're gonna have nightmares for the rest of your life.

2:07:09.380 --> 2:07:10.980
 But you should forgive.

2:07:10.980 --> 2:07:11.820
 No.

2:07:11.820 --> 2:07:12.980
 Well, there is truth in the fact

2:07:12.980 --> 2:07:15.780
 that forgiveness is the way to let go, right?

2:07:15.780 --> 2:07:20.780
 But that truth is not, fuck you, right?

2:07:23.420 --> 2:07:26.100
 Which is why it's not your job to say that.

2:07:26.100 --> 2:07:28.500
 Not that you're doing that, I know you're not.

2:07:28.500 --> 2:07:30.660
 But you know, the problem with people like me,

2:07:31.620 --> 2:07:34.740
 early phase, you could get this stupid missionary thing

2:07:34.740 --> 2:07:37.220
 going where you like, start trying to like,

2:07:38.580 --> 2:07:40.780
 I don't know, like proselytize ideals

2:07:40.780 --> 2:07:42.660
 that you might be incapable of, you know?

2:07:42.660 --> 2:07:46.660
 And I just, hearing it, you know, that's the,

2:07:46.660 --> 2:07:49.500
 man, I saw this, the thing that like,

2:07:49.500 --> 2:07:51.220
 I mean, I've seen a lot, all of us by now,

2:07:51.220 --> 2:07:53.420
 probably if we were online, I've seen,

2:07:53.420 --> 2:07:54.900
 and you just saw it in person.

2:07:54.900 --> 2:07:58.740
 Like we've seen things that are just horrific.

2:07:58.740 --> 2:08:03.420
 But as a dad, man, I just saw this clip of this kid

2:08:03.420 --> 2:08:08.220
 around the age of my kid, walking by himself,

2:08:08.220 --> 2:08:11.100
 these refugees, just walking by himself,

2:08:11.100 --> 2:08:13.340
 crying, the look on his face,

2:08:13.340 --> 2:08:15.780
 I can't explain the look on his face.

2:08:15.780 --> 2:08:17.060
 I don't know what happened to his parents.

2:08:17.060 --> 2:08:18.340
 I don't know what happened.

2:08:18.340 --> 2:08:21.340
 Like I, it was so upsetting.

2:08:21.340 --> 2:08:23.580
 Like even thinking about it now, it's just like, fuck,

2:08:23.580 --> 2:08:24.660
 that could have been my kid.

2:08:24.660 --> 2:08:26.860
 That could have been my kid, you know?

2:08:26.860 --> 2:08:29.340
 So knowing that kind of, that,

2:08:30.500 --> 2:08:33.500
 that kid's gotta grow up now.

2:08:33.500 --> 2:08:36.220
 And I don't know, is the kid's parents still there?

2:08:36.220 --> 2:08:41.220
 And that's just one of countless orphans out there now.

2:08:42.860 --> 2:08:45.180
 So what you have this hate,

2:08:45.180 --> 2:08:47.860
 and the question is how to direct it.

2:08:47.860 --> 2:08:50.500
 Because the choice is you can direct it

2:08:50.500 --> 2:08:53.340
 towards the politicians that started the war.

2:08:53.340 --> 2:08:55.100
 You can direct it towards the soldiers

2:08:55.100 --> 2:08:56.700
 that are doing the killing,

2:08:56.700 --> 2:08:59.500
 or you can direct it towards an entire group of people.

2:09:00.460 --> 2:09:04.060
 And that's the struggle because hate slowly grows

2:09:04.060 --> 2:09:08.420
 to where you don't just hate the soldiers.

2:09:08.420 --> 2:09:11.580
 You don't just hate the leaders.

2:09:11.580 --> 2:09:16.580
 You hate all Russians because they're all equally evil

2:09:17.300 --> 2:09:19.980
 because the ones that aren't doing the fighting

2:09:19.980 --> 2:09:21.660
 are staying quiet.

2:09:21.660 --> 2:09:24.140
 And I'm sure the same kind of stories are happening

2:09:24.140 --> 2:09:25.420
 on the other side.

2:09:25.420 --> 2:09:30.420
 And so there is, that hate is one

2:09:30.420 --> 2:09:35.420
 that is deeply human,

2:09:38.740 --> 2:09:43.620
 but you wonder for your own future, for your own home,

2:09:43.620 --> 2:09:45.500
 for building your own community,

2:09:45.500 --> 2:09:47.660
 for building your own country,

2:09:47.660 --> 2:09:52.660
 how does that hate morph over the weeks and months and years?

2:09:53.140 --> 2:09:56.220
 Not into forgiveness, but into something that's productive

2:09:56.220 --> 2:09:57.820
 that doesn't destroy you.

2:09:57.820 --> 2:09:59.560
 Because hate does destroy.

2:09:59.560 --> 2:10:04.560
 That's the dark aspect of a rocket that hits a building

2:10:06.220 --> 2:10:08.700
 and kills hundreds of people.

2:10:10.900 --> 2:10:13.060
 The worst effect of that rocket

2:10:16.540 --> 2:10:20.500
 is the hate in the hearts of the loved ones

2:10:21.620 --> 2:10:23.980
 to the people that were in that building.

2:10:23.980 --> 2:10:28.980
 That hate is a torture over a period of years after.

2:10:30.100 --> 2:10:32.540
 And that it doesn't just torture

2:10:33.500 --> 2:10:36.340
 by having that psychological burden and trauma.

2:10:36.340 --> 2:10:39.620
 It also tortures because it destroys your life.

2:10:39.620 --> 2:10:42.460
 It prevents you from being able to enjoy your life

2:10:42.460 --> 2:10:44.420
 to the fullest.

2:10:44.420 --> 2:10:49.300
 It prevents you from being able to flourish as a human being,

2:10:49.300 --> 2:10:53.700
 as a professional, in all those kinds of ways

2:10:53.700 --> 2:10:54.980
 that humans can flourish.

2:10:54.980 --> 2:10:57.100
 And I don't know.

2:10:57.100 --> 2:11:02.100
 It's such a, there is an aspect where this naive notion

2:11:05.740 --> 2:11:09.100
 is really powerful, that love and forgiveness

2:11:09.100 --> 2:11:12.340
 is the thing that's needed in this time.

2:11:12.340 --> 2:11:16.580
 And when I talk to soldiers, they don't,

2:11:18.380 --> 2:11:21.620
 I remember bringing up to Jaco,

2:11:21.620 --> 2:11:23.820
 is there a sense where the people you're fighting

2:11:23.820 --> 2:11:25.180
 are just brothers in arms,

2:11:25.180 --> 2:11:27.780
 bringing up the Dire Straits song, Brothers in Arms?

2:11:28.820 --> 2:11:31.880
 And he was basically, without swearing, saying fuck that,

2:11:31.880 --> 2:11:33.060
 that they're the enemy.

2:11:33.060 --> 2:11:36.380
 Yeah, I mean, he's literally in survival mode.

2:11:36.380 --> 2:11:37.380
 He can't think like that.

2:11:37.380 --> 2:11:39.220
 It's gonna create latency in the system

2:11:39.220 --> 2:11:40.860
 and that's gonna lower his survivability.

2:11:40.860 --> 2:11:41.700
 You can't think that.

2:11:41.700 --> 2:11:44.300
 I mean, we're talking about cognitively.

2:11:44.300 --> 2:11:45.660
 You can't have latency.

2:11:45.660 --> 2:11:49.100
 Like, if you're, that one moment of hesitation,

2:11:49.100 --> 2:11:51.300
 you see it sometimes in these YouTube videos

2:11:51.300 --> 2:11:56.300
 of like somebody, a new cop has been unfortunate enough

2:11:59.220 --> 2:12:03.060
 to run into something that is a phenomenon, suicide by cop.

2:12:03.060 --> 2:12:07.060
 Somebody has a knife and that person is running towards them

2:12:07.060 --> 2:12:10.940
 with a knife and they're begging the person to stop,

2:12:10.940 --> 2:12:12.460
 that you can hear it in their voice.

2:12:12.460 --> 2:12:17.260
 They're begging, stop, stop, stop, stop.

2:12:17.260 --> 2:12:19.220
 And the person is not gonna stop.

2:12:19.220 --> 2:12:24.220
 So the critique of that is that that latency

2:12:27.860 --> 2:12:31.000
 could potentially not just lead to the cop getting killed,

2:12:31.000 --> 2:12:34.380
 but to that person with a knife killing other people.

2:12:34.380 --> 2:12:39.300
 And so, you know, I get, if I were out there,

2:12:39.300 --> 2:12:44.300
 I think that like, you probably just as a matter

2:12:44.340 --> 2:12:47.900
 of like not getting shot and being fully in the moment,

2:12:47.900 --> 2:12:48.860
 you have to be like that.

2:12:48.860 --> 2:12:50.140
 I would guess, I don't know.

2:12:50.140 --> 2:12:51.300
 I don't know, I'm the furthest thing

2:12:51.300 --> 2:12:52.300
 from a soldier there could be,

2:12:52.300 --> 2:12:57.300
 but there's something Jack Kornfield,

2:12:57.580 --> 2:12:58.720
 this great Buddhist teacher says,

2:12:58.720 --> 2:13:03.420
 which is tend to the part of the garden you can touch.

2:13:03.420 --> 2:13:05.900
 Meaning this is where we're at right now.

2:13:05.900 --> 2:13:09.220
 Thank God you and I, though we are experiencing

2:13:09.220 --> 2:13:11.980
 some like ripples from what's going on over there,

2:13:11.980 --> 2:13:14.220
 everyone is, we're not there.

2:13:14.220 --> 2:13:17.460
 And thank God we don't have to come up

2:13:17.460 --> 2:13:21.860
 with the psychological program

2:13:21.860 --> 2:13:24.020
 for people going through that

2:13:24.020 --> 2:13:27.620
 to no longer be encumbered by that hate.

2:13:27.620 --> 2:13:28.460
 Thank God.

2:13:28.460 --> 2:13:30.220
 And I don't know if that's just lazy or whatever,

2:13:30.220 --> 2:13:31.940
 but it's like, you know, for me,

2:13:31.940 --> 2:13:33.500
 I just, I have to bring it back to,

2:13:33.500 --> 2:13:35.600
 all right, well, here's where I'm at now.

2:13:35.600 --> 2:13:40.600
 And I don't want there to be war.

2:13:41.160 --> 2:13:44.660
 I don't want to hurt people, but yeah, I love what you said.

2:13:44.660 --> 2:13:47.660
 I think what you said is the, if anything,

2:13:47.660 --> 2:13:52.500
 is the most intelligent way of looking at it.

2:13:52.500 --> 2:13:55.820
 It's like, don't pretend that you're not gonna feel

2:13:55.820 --> 2:13:58.360
 that hate, like you're gonna feel it.

2:13:58.360 --> 2:13:59.200
 There's no way around it.

2:13:59.200 --> 2:14:00.500
 Or like, cause that's even worse.

2:14:00.500 --> 2:14:02.200
 Cause then you're almost saying like something's wrong

2:14:02.200 --> 2:14:05.300
 with them for feeling the hate or, you know, whatever.

2:14:05.300 --> 2:14:09.300
 But more along the lines, if you can avoid applying

2:14:09.300 --> 2:14:14.300
 that hate to an entire country of people, then do that.

2:14:18.060 --> 2:14:20.640
 Like, just understand, we're talking about like a,

2:14:24.260 --> 2:14:25.140
 not everybody.

2:14:25.140 --> 2:14:26.500
 I know it's not everybody.

2:14:26.500 --> 2:14:27.580
 I know it's not everybody.

2:14:27.580 --> 2:14:28.660
 It's just easier, isn't it?

2:14:28.660 --> 2:14:33.660
 Cognitively, it's somehow easier to think all Russians,

2:14:33.940 --> 2:14:37.860
 monsters, you know, all Russians,

2:14:37.860 --> 2:14:40.100
 all whatever the particular like thing is

2:14:40.100 --> 2:14:42.060
 that you're supposed to not like.

2:14:42.060 --> 2:14:43.920
 It's easier somehow, weirdly.

2:14:43.920 --> 2:14:45.900
 You'd think that'd be more difficult.

2:14:45.900 --> 2:14:50.900
 Yeah, but I guess the lesson is if you give in

2:14:50.900 --> 2:14:55.660
 to the easy solution, that's going to lead

2:14:55.660 --> 2:14:58.280
 to detrimental longterm effects.

2:14:58.280 --> 2:15:03.280
 So hate should be, it's such a powerful tool

2:15:03.280 --> 2:15:08.280
 that you should try to control it for your own sake.

2:15:08.520 --> 2:15:10.320
 Not because you owe anything to anybody,

2:15:10.320 --> 2:15:14.520
 but for your own psychological development over time.

2:15:14.520 --> 2:15:19.080
 Right, right, that's it, that's it, fuck.

2:15:19.080 --> 2:15:21.400
 Yeah, yeah.

2:15:21.400 --> 2:15:25.700
 In terms of dark places, you suffered from depression.

2:15:26.640 --> 2:15:28.360
 Where has been some of the darker places

2:15:28.360 --> 2:15:30.200
 you've gone in your mind?

2:15:31.480 --> 2:15:32.720
 You know, I needed therapy, man.

2:15:32.720 --> 2:15:36.640
 I needed therapy for the longest time, I just didn't get it.

2:15:36.640 --> 2:15:41.640
 So because of that, I would go through like bouts

2:15:44.360 --> 2:15:49.360
 of like paralytic depression, like suicidal depression,

2:15:49.400 --> 2:15:51.760
 suicidal ideations that were more than just ideations.

2:15:51.760 --> 2:15:56.320
 I mean, I think like people get afraid

2:15:56.320 --> 2:15:59.540
 when the thought of suicide appears in their consciousness,

2:15:59.540 --> 2:16:01.160
 they get really scared of themselves.

2:16:01.160 --> 2:16:03.100
 So they think there's something like,

2:16:03.100 --> 2:16:04.120
 fuck, what's going on with me?

2:16:04.120 --> 2:16:04.960
 Why would I think that?

2:16:04.960 --> 2:16:08.080
 But I think if we are suffering and, you know,

2:16:08.080 --> 2:16:11.280
 as a natural part of not wanting to reduce suffering

2:16:11.280 --> 2:16:16.040
 or not feel bad anymore, I mean, suicide is going to be an,

2:16:16.040 --> 2:16:17.400
 like, if we're just, you know, you're just looking,

2:16:17.400 --> 2:16:18.280
 what are all the options?

2:16:18.280 --> 2:16:19.920
 Let's brainstorm here.

2:16:19.920 --> 2:16:20.760
 You know what I mean?

2:16:20.760 --> 2:16:22.480
 I could start drinking more water.

2:16:22.480 --> 2:16:26.120
 You start jogging, get some therapy, call my friends,

2:16:26.120 --> 2:16:27.840
 all the stuff we all hear.

2:16:27.840 --> 2:16:30.200
 Or I could just, I think the height

2:16:30.200 --> 2:16:31.920
 of my apartment building is probably the,

2:16:31.920 --> 2:16:34.520
 definitely the right height to kill myself.

2:16:34.520 --> 2:16:39.120
 And then, so where, for me, like the few times

2:16:39.120 --> 2:16:41.720
 where the ideation has gone towards like,

2:16:43.600 --> 2:16:45.480
 well, when would I do that?

2:16:45.480 --> 2:16:47.480
 How do I, what, you know, what do I need

2:16:47.480 --> 2:16:50.080
 to like accomplish that?

2:16:50.080 --> 2:16:52.940
 When then like, that's where it gets really fucking scary.

2:16:52.940 --> 2:16:54.400
 That's where it's like terrifying.

2:16:54.400 --> 2:16:57.800
 And so you start the actual details of the planning

2:16:57.800 --> 2:17:00.080
 of how to commit suicide.

2:17:00.080 --> 2:17:00.960
 Yeah.

2:17:00.960 --> 2:17:02.760
 What's going to be the least painful way to do it?

2:17:02.760 --> 2:17:04.680
 What's going to be the most instantaneous way to do it?

2:17:04.680 --> 2:17:06.640
 What's the, you know, and with, you know,

2:17:06.640 --> 2:17:11.080
 with depression, because it can be progressive,

2:17:11.080 --> 2:17:13.600
 you know, this is why you have to really just stay

2:17:13.600 --> 2:17:14.440
 on top of it.

2:17:14.440 --> 2:17:15.360
 Anyone who's gone through depression

2:17:15.360 --> 2:17:16.240
 knows what I'm talking about.

2:17:16.240 --> 2:17:17.320
 You gotta stay on top of it.

2:17:17.320 --> 2:17:18.600
 Like you might need medication.

2:17:18.600 --> 2:17:20.560
 You know, I know this is controversial now,

2:17:20.560 --> 2:17:22.720
 but it's still better than dying if you ask me.

2:17:22.720 --> 2:17:24.800
 But at some point with depression,

2:17:24.800 --> 2:17:26.620
 it like becomes paralyzing.

2:17:26.620 --> 2:17:28.200
 So you don't want to get out of bed anymore

2:17:28.200 --> 2:17:30.060
 and you're not taking showers anymore.

2:17:30.060 --> 2:17:31.680
 And you don't want to talk to anybody anymore.

2:17:31.680 --> 2:17:33.160
 And you're not answering your phone anymore.

2:17:33.160 --> 2:17:35.200
 And, you know.

2:17:35.200 --> 2:17:38.360
 So like in a dark place that you might be in,

2:17:38.360 --> 2:17:39.840
 it still might get worse.

2:17:39.840 --> 2:17:43.760
 So you should really do everything you can

2:17:43.760 --> 2:17:45.400
 to get under control.

2:17:45.400 --> 2:17:47.440
 And that's the problem with that specific

2:17:47.440 --> 2:17:49.380
 psychological disorder.

2:17:49.380 --> 2:17:50.440
 That's the problem.

2:17:50.440 --> 2:17:52.480
 Because the things it's like,

2:17:52.480 --> 2:17:54.880
 if you start listening to what you want to,

2:17:54.880 --> 2:17:56.600
 you think it's you, it's the depression.

2:17:56.600 --> 2:17:58.320
 You start listening to it.

2:17:58.320 --> 2:18:00.840
 It wants you to stay in bed.

2:18:00.840 --> 2:18:03.960
 And then you're getting those fucking depression sleeps,

2:18:03.960 --> 2:18:06.400
 you know, or you wake up and you're more tired.

2:18:06.400 --> 2:18:07.760
 Like it's not working.

2:18:07.760 --> 2:18:11.360
 You're trying to escape reality by sleeping.

2:18:11.360 --> 2:18:13.680
 And so, yeah.

2:18:13.680 --> 2:18:15.600
 Like you have to like,

2:18:15.600 --> 2:18:18.360
 you're fighting for your,

2:18:18.360 --> 2:18:19.800
 you're literally fighting for your life.

2:18:19.800 --> 2:18:20.840
 It might not seem like that.

2:18:20.840 --> 2:18:23.460
 Cause you can't, if you could see depression,

2:18:23.460 --> 2:18:24.300
 if you could see it,

2:18:24.300 --> 2:18:28.920
 if you knew you had some inky, vaporous octopus thing

2:18:28.920 --> 2:18:31.320
 that was just wrapping around you

2:18:31.320 --> 2:18:33.280
 more and more and more and more,

2:18:33.280 --> 2:18:34.600
 you would probably do everything you could

2:18:34.600 --> 2:18:36.120
 to rip that fucking thing off your body.

2:18:36.120 --> 2:18:38.000
 And if you couldn't get it off your body,

2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:41.120
 you would be calling people to get help.

2:18:41.120 --> 2:18:43.520
 So it doesn't feel like a fight because you're exhausted.

2:18:43.520 --> 2:18:45.280
 There's no reason to move.

2:18:45.280 --> 2:18:48.000
 There's no, you don't see the meaning for any of it.

2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:50.200
 So it doesn't feel like a battle, but it is a battle.

2:18:50.200 --> 2:18:51.040
 You're not feeling.

2:18:51.040 --> 2:18:51.860
 I mean, that's the other thing.

2:18:51.860 --> 2:18:53.560
 You're just, you're basically not feeling.

2:18:53.560 --> 2:18:55.600
 You're like, you start going numb.

2:18:55.600 --> 2:18:57.520
 At least that was my experience with it.

2:18:57.520 --> 2:18:58.760
 Numb and tired.

2:18:58.760 --> 2:19:01.420
 And then increasingly numb and tired.

2:19:01.420 --> 2:19:05.240
 And then increasingly sort of disconnecting from reality.

2:19:05.240 --> 2:19:06.360
 And then somewhere in there,

2:19:06.360 --> 2:19:08.840
 that's when you start playing around with the idea

2:19:08.840 --> 2:19:10.680
 of like, oh, I don't know if it's worth it.

2:19:10.680 --> 2:19:11.520
 I don't know.

2:19:11.520 --> 2:19:14.640
 Now, you know, I think compared to some of my friends

2:19:14.640 --> 2:19:15.940
 who haven't survived,

2:19:15.940 --> 2:19:17.920
 obviously who haven't survived depression,

2:19:17.920 --> 2:19:21.840
 like mine was definitely not whatever theirs was like.

2:19:21.840 --> 2:19:26.320
 I've heard, I mean, to understand it for folks out there,

2:19:26.320 --> 2:19:27.280
 maybe you haven't gone through it.

2:19:27.280 --> 2:19:30.560
 Just imagine if like, how bad you have to feel

2:19:30.560 --> 2:19:32.720
 if death is the solution,

2:19:32.720 --> 2:19:35.200
 like violence against yourself

2:19:35.200 --> 2:19:37.120
 so that you die is the solution.

2:19:37.120 --> 2:19:42.120
 Like just, it flies in the face of everything.

2:19:43.080 --> 2:19:48.080
 So yeah, that was definitely the darkest place

2:19:48.100 --> 2:19:48.940
 that I've ever been.

2:19:48.940 --> 2:19:52.440
 Just that death doesn't seem like, because you don't care

2:19:52.440 --> 2:19:54.160
 about anything anymore,

2:19:54.160 --> 2:19:56.440
 that death just doesn't seem like that bad.

2:19:56.440 --> 2:19:57.280
 Yeah.

2:19:58.580 --> 2:20:01.440
 Like you're not able to appropriately assign

2:20:02.720 --> 2:20:05.620
 the negative costs to the solution.

2:20:05.620 --> 2:20:06.460
 Right.

2:20:06.460 --> 2:20:07.820
 It just seems like a reasonable solution.

2:20:07.820 --> 2:20:11.840
 Yeah, but I think also what's going along with it

2:20:11.840 --> 2:20:15.280
 is like, it's not like your brain isn't working.

2:20:15.280 --> 2:20:17.600
 Like you're not thinking,

2:20:17.600 --> 2:20:19.240
 obviously you're not thinking clearly.

2:20:19.240 --> 2:20:22.760
 Like, at least again, this was my experience of it.

2:20:22.760 --> 2:20:23.920
 It's a fog.

2:20:23.920 --> 2:20:27.640
 You're in some kind of, like you're confused.

2:20:27.640 --> 2:20:29.160
 There's confusion.

2:20:29.160 --> 2:20:31.280
 There's shame.

2:20:31.280 --> 2:20:32.200
 You feel embarrassed.

2:20:32.200 --> 2:20:33.140
 You feel embarrassed.

2:20:33.140 --> 2:20:34.040
 You wanna get out of bed.

2:20:34.040 --> 2:20:34.920
 You wanna do stuff.

2:20:34.920 --> 2:20:38.360
 You wanna be compelled to be social and do all this stuff,

2:20:38.360 --> 2:20:40.480
 but you're not, you're not.

2:20:40.480 --> 2:20:42.800
 Like you seem, if people don't know what's going on

2:20:42.800 --> 2:20:45.120
 and you're not telling them because you're embarrassed,

2:20:45.120 --> 2:20:48.880
 because you want to have some like,

2:20:48.880 --> 2:20:53.880
 you know, uncorrupted, unworped psyche,

2:20:54.100 --> 2:20:57.920
 you know, you're like, it invites you to be secret about it.

2:20:57.920 --> 2:20:59.400
 That's one of its first tricks

2:20:59.400 --> 2:21:01.640
 is it tells you not to tell anybody.

2:21:01.640 --> 2:21:06.320
 And that's deadly in that case, it's deadly.

2:21:06.320 --> 2:21:07.840
 What was the source of light?

2:21:07.840 --> 2:21:11.840
 What was the, what were for you

2:21:11.840 --> 2:21:14.200
 and in general the ways out?

2:21:14.200 --> 2:21:19.120
 Yeah, so for me, the solutions,

2:21:19.120 --> 2:21:22.120
 and again, man, for my depressed friends out there,

2:21:22.120 --> 2:21:23.140
 please don't get mad at me.

2:21:23.140 --> 2:21:24.200
 I'm not doing the thing of like,

2:21:24.200 --> 2:21:26.800
 just put on a smile or any of that bullshit

2:21:26.800 --> 2:21:28.040
 because it doesn't feel like that

2:21:28.040 --> 2:21:31.920
 when you're like, and when you're fighting it,

2:21:31.920 --> 2:21:35.260
 it's like you are, you're in a,

2:21:36.680 --> 2:21:39.360
 I don't know why I keep using these stupid gravity analogies,

2:21:39.360 --> 2:21:42.240
 but it's like the gravity's been turned up on your planet

2:21:42.240 --> 2:21:45.400
 in every single way by, so getting out of bed.

2:21:45.400 --> 2:21:46.240
 You know, like.

2:21:47.840 --> 2:21:50.640
 By the way, gravity and quantum mechanics,

2:21:50.640 --> 2:21:54.040
 one of the most beautiful things about our reality,

2:21:54.040 --> 2:21:56.720
 what the hell is each of those things?

2:21:56.720 --> 2:22:00.880
 So this isn't, you're not just talking about

2:22:00.880 --> 2:22:04.120
 hippie language, it's still physicists

2:22:04.120 --> 2:22:05.920
 pretend they understand something.

2:22:05.920 --> 2:22:07.840
 We're still at the very beginning of understanding

2:22:07.840 --> 2:22:09.680
 this mysterious world of ours

2:22:09.680 --> 2:22:11.640
 that seems to be functioning according

2:22:11.640 --> 2:22:16.640
 to these weirdly simple and yet universally powerful laws,

2:22:18.080 --> 2:22:20.680
 which we don't fully yet understand.

2:22:20.680 --> 2:22:24.040
 So please, the metaphor and the analogy of gravity.

2:22:24.040 --> 2:22:24.880
 Okay, thank you.

2:22:24.880 --> 2:22:25.700
 Fully, fully applicable.

2:22:25.700 --> 2:22:26.540
 I don't know any other way to put it

2:22:26.540 --> 2:22:28.520
 than it's like somebody turned the gravitational field

2:22:28.520 --> 2:22:29.720
 of your mattress up by.

2:22:29.720 --> 2:22:30.680
 So everything is heavy.

2:22:30.680 --> 2:22:33.060
 Heavy, your body's heavy.

2:22:33.060 --> 2:22:34.020
 You don't wanna get out of bed,

2:22:34.020 --> 2:22:36.800
 you will consider shitting or pissing the bed

2:22:36.800 --> 2:22:38.180
 because you're just like, who gives a fuck,

2:22:38.180 --> 2:22:40.280
 I'll just lay in my shit and piss.

2:22:40.280 --> 2:22:44.760
 You're dying, you're like, none of it makes sense.

2:22:50.160 --> 2:22:52.040
 And I feel like in retrospect,

2:22:52.040 --> 2:22:55.900
 I'm making what I've done a little,

2:22:55.900 --> 2:22:57.360
 like I had more lucidity.

2:22:57.360 --> 2:23:02.360
 It was more of like when you're wrestling with someone

2:23:02.880 --> 2:23:06.920
 and you're just like, it's different for you.

2:23:06.920 --> 2:23:08.080
 But for me, if I'm wrestling,

2:23:08.080 --> 2:23:10.000
 I'm not thinking about jujitsu moves.

2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:10.840
 I'm like.

2:23:10.840 --> 2:23:11.680
 Survival.

2:23:11.680 --> 2:23:12.500
 You're just.

2:23:12.500 --> 2:23:13.340
 So it's like that.

2:23:13.340 --> 2:23:14.960
 It is a struggle.

2:23:14.960 --> 2:23:19.960
 Like it's like, you really have to deliberately fight.

2:23:20.580 --> 2:23:21.420
 Everything.

2:23:21.420 --> 2:23:25.760
 So you start, so you can almost have a conversation

2:23:25.760 --> 2:23:27.560
 with the depression.

2:23:27.560 --> 2:23:30.880
 And then what you do is you start doing the opposite

2:23:30.880 --> 2:23:33.260
 of everything it's telling you to do.

2:23:33.260 --> 2:23:36.620
 So it's telling you lay in bed.

2:23:36.620 --> 2:23:38.300
 So you get out of bed.

2:23:38.300 --> 2:23:41.760
 It's definitely telling you don't fucking exercise.

2:23:41.760 --> 2:23:43.160
 You're gonna go fucking exercise.

2:23:43.160 --> 2:23:44.200
 That's not gonna do anything.

2:23:44.200 --> 2:23:45.040
 You can't.

2:23:45.040 --> 2:23:46.440
 You probably have a heart attack.

2:23:46.440 --> 2:23:48.080
 You really wanna go outside.

2:23:48.080 --> 2:23:50.680
 Don't go fucking exercise.

2:23:50.680 --> 2:23:53.360
 And it'll feel crazy.

2:23:53.360 --> 2:23:54.860
 And you won't wanna do it.

2:23:54.860 --> 2:23:57.380
 If you wanted to do it, you wouldn't be depressed.

2:23:57.380 --> 2:23:58.480
 Like how often do you hear

2:23:58.480 --> 2:24:00.400
 like one of the symptoms of depression?

2:24:00.400 --> 2:24:01.560
 You wanna jog.

2:24:01.560 --> 2:24:02.960
 You wanna get on a bike.

2:24:02.960 --> 2:24:04.000
 You know, you don't hear that.

2:24:04.000 --> 2:24:04.920
 That's not a symptom.

2:24:04.920 --> 2:24:08.600
 So you start, at least one solution

2:24:08.600 --> 2:24:11.920
 I just started doing the opposite of.

2:24:11.920 --> 2:24:14.440
 Whatever the voice is telling you, do the opposite.

2:24:14.440 --> 2:24:15.280
 That.

2:24:15.280 --> 2:24:20.280
 And then suddenly the gravitational field

2:24:21.240 --> 2:24:22.280
 diminishes a little bit.

2:24:22.280 --> 2:24:23.560
 It doesn't go all the way away.

2:24:23.560 --> 2:24:25.600
 And that's where you can fall right back into it

2:24:25.600 --> 2:24:27.600
 cause you just feel even slightly better.

2:24:27.600 --> 2:24:29.720
 You're like, oh, okay, I fixed it.

2:24:29.720 --> 2:24:31.200
 You know, really, I think if you like

2:24:31.200 --> 2:24:36.200
 and having been through therapy, the best solution

2:24:37.120 --> 2:24:42.120
 would be go to a fucking therapist as quickly as you can.

2:24:42.840 --> 2:24:45.720
 Just sit down with them and tell them what's going on.

2:24:46.920 --> 2:24:47.760
 I know what you're thinking.

2:24:47.760 --> 2:24:49.680
 How am I gonna find a therapist?

2:24:49.680 --> 2:24:51.540
 Just do it.

2:24:51.540 --> 2:24:53.280
 Google it, go on Yelp.

2:24:53.280 --> 2:24:56.080
 All of this shit feels impossible.

2:24:56.080 --> 2:24:57.480
 You're like, I don't wanna turn on the computer.

2:24:57.480 --> 2:24:58.400
 I don't wanna do any of this.

2:24:58.400 --> 2:24:59.240
 You just have to.

2:24:59.240 --> 2:25:00.080
 I mean, you have to.

2:25:00.080 --> 2:25:01.680
 You do it if you're on fire.

2:25:01.680 --> 2:25:02.680
 You do it if you're on fire.

2:25:02.680 --> 2:25:03.520
 And someone's like, you know,

2:25:03.520 --> 2:25:05.320
 here's a way to not be on fire.

2:25:05.320 --> 2:25:07.800
 Just this particular fire is,

2:25:07.800 --> 2:25:09.880
 it doesn't make you wanna run around screaming.

2:25:09.880 --> 2:25:11.520
 It just makes you wanna fall asleep forever.

2:25:11.520 --> 2:25:15.160
 And that, but those little steps,

2:25:15.160 --> 2:25:16.960
 I got lucky because it worked.

2:25:16.960 --> 2:25:18.720
 It worked, I started exercising.

2:25:18.720 --> 2:25:20.960
 I'd been on antidepressants before

2:25:20.960 --> 2:25:23.320
 when I was originally diagnosed with it.

2:25:24.640 --> 2:25:26.000
 Did those help?

2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:28.880
 You know, I, even with all the current research

2:25:28.880 --> 2:25:31.640
 coming out about, that maybe we were all wrong

2:25:31.640 --> 2:25:33.920
 about our understanding of depression,

2:25:33.920 --> 2:25:38.400
 I do feel like it helped in a certain way.

2:25:38.400 --> 2:25:42.160
 Like it definitely, it definitely like

2:25:42.160 --> 2:25:43.400
 made me stop thinking about,

2:25:43.400 --> 2:25:45.220
 it stopped the intrusive thoughts.

2:25:45.220 --> 2:25:48.160
 And, but I don't know how much of that was placebo

2:25:48.160 --> 2:25:49.320
 or how much of that, I don't know.

2:25:49.320 --> 2:25:51.720
 But then also like I couldn't cum anymore.

2:25:51.720 --> 2:25:53.280
 That was the other fucked up thing.

2:25:53.280 --> 2:25:55.640
 Like you're, you can't have orgasms.

2:25:55.640 --> 2:25:58.800
 And which might not sound like a big deal,

2:25:58.800 --> 2:26:02.120
 but you know, when I told my therapist

2:26:02.120 --> 2:26:03.760
 that they actually took me off them,

2:26:03.760 --> 2:26:05.640
 cause I think she was realizing

2:26:05.640 --> 2:26:07.980
 that it started diminishing a little bit.

2:26:07.980 --> 2:26:11.080
 But the one I'm talking about now,

2:26:11.080 --> 2:26:14.400
 that whatever episode or whatever you wanna call it,

2:26:14.400 --> 2:26:16.360
 I just got lucky cause it worked.

2:26:16.360 --> 2:26:19.080
 It worked and I started feeling better, thank God.

2:26:19.080 --> 2:26:22.160
 Now, if you suffer from depression out there

2:26:22.160 --> 2:26:24.280
 and you've had a remission of the depression,

2:26:24.280 --> 2:26:26.080
 you know, it's really like,

2:26:26.080 --> 2:26:27.840
 it's scary to have mental illness

2:26:27.840 --> 2:26:32.760
 because everyone gets bummed out.

2:26:32.760 --> 2:26:33.920
 I mean, that's just normal.

2:26:33.920 --> 2:26:35.080
 Like you're gonna get bummed out

2:26:35.080 --> 2:26:36.600
 and I don't wanna do anything sometimes.

2:26:36.600 --> 2:26:38.160
 It doesn't mean you have a clinical depression.

2:26:38.160 --> 2:26:40.220
 You might just be bummed out or grieving.

2:26:40.220 --> 2:26:42.520
 You might be any number of things.

2:26:42.520 --> 2:26:46.960
 But when I get really nervous,

2:26:46.960 --> 2:26:49.920
 if some of those symptoms start showing up.

2:26:49.920 --> 2:26:54.920
 And at one point I felt like that was happening again.

2:26:54.920 --> 2:26:59.480
 And I did intramuscular ketamine therapy,

2:26:59.480 --> 2:27:02.920
 which now that was the damnedest thing

2:27:02.920 --> 2:27:04.080
 I've ever experienced.

2:27:04.080 --> 2:27:08.080
 Aside from the fact that ketamine is immensely psychedelic.

2:27:10.860 --> 2:27:14.080
 I just remember going back to the hotel

2:27:14.080 --> 2:27:17.200
 after the experience with the clinician.

2:27:17.200 --> 2:27:21.900
 And like, you know, it's like with depression,

2:27:21.900 --> 2:27:24.700
 it's like a headache that starts coming on.

2:27:24.700 --> 2:27:27.160
 But you're like, this headache might last for years.

2:27:27.160 --> 2:27:28.640
 It might last for six months.

2:27:28.640 --> 2:27:30.840
 It might get worse and worse and worse.

2:27:30.840 --> 2:27:35.840
 And so I went back to the hotel room and it was just gone.

2:27:37.280 --> 2:27:38.480
 Like I just felt normal.

2:27:38.480 --> 2:27:39.440
 It felt great.

2:27:39.440 --> 2:27:42.560
 It was like the most remarkable thing ever.

2:27:42.560 --> 2:27:45.960
 So, you know, look at the research on ketamine right now.

2:27:45.960 --> 2:27:49.080
 It's like, it's not like bullshit.

2:27:49.080 --> 2:27:50.560
 It's not like woo science.

2:27:50.560 --> 2:27:52.240
 There's really, really good data out there

2:27:52.240 --> 2:27:55.480
 showing that something like, I think it's 60%.

2:27:55.480 --> 2:27:56.680
 I don't know what the percentage is,

2:27:56.680 --> 2:28:01.680
 but 60% of people with an endogenous depression

2:28:02.200 --> 2:28:06.480
 when they get ketamine therapy will experience remission,

2:28:06.480 --> 2:28:08.320
 regardless of whether you trip out or not.

2:28:08.320 --> 2:28:10.960
 It just does something that I don't know

2:28:10.960 --> 2:28:11.960
 if they know what it is yet.

2:28:11.960 --> 2:28:12.800
 I don't care if they do.

2:28:12.800 --> 2:28:14.060
 But that one thing worked.

2:28:14.060 --> 2:28:17.600
 And basically you keep fighting until something works.

2:28:17.600 --> 2:28:18.440
 Exactly.

2:28:18.440 --> 2:28:19.760
 It's a survival issue.

2:28:19.760 --> 2:28:21.000
 And it's a survival issue.

2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:24.500
 But it's just, I think because it's kind of so slow moving,

2:28:24.500 --> 2:28:26.760
 you might even forget it's progressive.

2:28:26.760 --> 2:28:28.320
 Or, you know, you could easily just think

2:28:28.320 --> 2:28:30.880
 that you're just a kind of bummed out person.

2:28:30.880 --> 2:28:34.960
 Or you start thinking that these aspects of your psychology

2:28:34.960 --> 2:28:37.360
 are permanent when they don't have to be.

2:28:37.360 --> 2:28:39.980
 What about other people in your life?

2:28:39.980 --> 2:28:41.700
 What advice would you give to people

2:28:41.700 --> 2:28:44.720
 that have loved ones who suffer from depression?

2:28:44.720 --> 2:28:46.360
 What are they to do?

2:28:46.360 --> 2:28:51.360
 Okay, now this is really like, man, it's really dark.

2:28:54.680 --> 2:28:57.480
 Here's number one.

2:28:57.480 --> 2:28:59.240
 This is what somebody told me

2:28:59.240 --> 2:29:00.980
 when I lost a friend to suicide, you know?

2:29:00.980 --> 2:29:02.800
 Because when you lose a friend to suicide,

2:29:02.800 --> 2:29:04.600
 when you lose a loved one to suicide,

2:29:04.600 --> 2:29:05.760
 you're gonna blame yourself.

2:29:05.760 --> 2:29:10.760
 It's like in the periphery of suicide,

2:29:10.920 --> 2:29:14.480
 there is a circumference of guilty people

2:29:14.480 --> 2:29:17.240
 who all feel like, oh, if only I'd said this

2:29:17.240 --> 2:29:19.600
 at the right time, if only I'd listened more,

2:29:19.600 --> 2:29:22.160
 if only I'd seen that warning sign,

2:29:22.160 --> 2:29:23.520
 if only this or that.

2:29:25.080 --> 2:29:30.080
 It's interesting in that with other forms of like disease,

2:29:31.820 --> 2:29:36.820
 you know, if your loved one dies from cancer, say,

2:29:37.160 --> 2:29:39.600
 more than likely, you're not gonna be thinking like,

2:29:39.600 --> 2:29:41.440
 oh, I should have cured their cancer.

2:29:41.440 --> 2:29:43.440
 You know, like it's a tragedy,

2:29:43.440 --> 2:29:46.120
 but at least you're not like, oh, if only I had.

2:29:46.120 --> 2:29:48.480
 You still might think that's part of grief, but.

2:29:49.560 --> 2:29:52.120
 It's not as sticky in many of the other situations.

2:29:52.120 --> 2:29:55.360
 Here, the guilt couldn't really stay for a long time.

2:29:55.360 --> 2:30:00.360
 Yep, so you, number one, we're talking about

2:30:02.320 --> 2:30:05.360
 a progressive disease that can lead to death.

2:30:05.360 --> 2:30:07.920
 And if somebody commits suicide,

2:30:07.920 --> 2:30:09.420
 they wanted to commit suicide.

2:30:09.420 --> 2:30:12.920
 And at least what I've been told is you can't stop it.

2:30:12.920 --> 2:30:15.840
 It's gonna happen, it's gonna happen.

2:30:15.840 --> 2:30:16.840
 There are no magic words.

2:30:16.840 --> 2:30:18.240
 There's nothing you could do.

2:30:18.240 --> 2:30:21.520
 So, you know, people who've lost people to suicide,

2:30:21.520 --> 2:30:23.000
 you know what I'm talking about.

2:30:23.000 --> 2:30:26.320
 Like, you know, you can watch it happen in real time

2:30:26.320 --> 2:30:28.280
 and there's just nothing you could do.

2:30:29.760 --> 2:30:34.140
 That being said, you know, being responsive

2:30:34.140 --> 2:30:36.120
 to when it seems like someone's really reaching out

2:30:36.120 --> 2:30:40.840
 for help and knowing that maybe even though it might,

2:30:40.840 --> 2:30:42.960
 especially if it's someone who's like, doesn't talk

2:30:42.960 --> 2:30:44.760
 like this a lot of the time,

2:30:44.760 --> 2:30:47.160
 and sentences start coming out of their mouth,

2:30:47.160 --> 2:30:49.480
 that if you weren't really paying attention,

2:30:49.480 --> 2:30:50.960
 might not seem like a big deal,

2:30:50.960 --> 2:30:52.920
 but for this person, it's kind of anomalous

2:30:52.920 --> 2:30:56.480
 that all of a sudden that's happening.

2:30:56.480 --> 2:30:59.560
 Now there, that's when you can be a good listener

2:30:59.560 --> 2:31:01.960
 and, you know, open up to them and hear what they're saying

2:31:01.960 --> 2:31:04.160
 and see like, oh, shit, are they asking me for it?

2:31:04.160 --> 2:31:05.800
 Is this them asking for help?

2:31:05.800 --> 2:31:08.720
 And even if you're like, I don't know what to do,

2:31:08.720 --> 2:31:13.720
 you know, at least you can like start checking in on them,

2:31:14.060 --> 2:31:16.640
 you know, start like help them understand

2:31:16.640 --> 2:31:17.960
 that you're there for them

2:31:17.960 --> 2:31:19.680
 and then hopefully get them into therapy,

2:31:19.680 --> 2:31:22.720
 get them to a doctor, get them to a professional

2:31:22.720 --> 2:31:25.080
 who can like see what's going on there.

2:31:25.080 --> 2:31:27.040
 So that, and then there's hope.

2:31:27.040 --> 2:31:28.720
 And even then there might not be hope actually,

2:31:28.720 --> 2:31:30.240
 you know, doctors can't stop it.

2:31:30.240 --> 2:31:34.540
 There's no, sometimes it just, that's the way it goes.

2:31:34.540 --> 2:31:39.120
 But, you know, I know that like being sensitive,

2:31:39.120 --> 2:31:41.460
 if somebody's like all of a sudden hitting you up

2:31:41.460 --> 2:31:44.320
 or reaching out to you that normally isn't like that

2:31:44.320 --> 2:31:46.060
 and just, what's going on?

2:31:46.060 --> 2:31:46.900
 How are you?

2:31:46.900 --> 2:31:48.040
 And just listen.

2:31:48.040 --> 2:31:50.600
 Which in general, depression or not,

2:31:50.600 --> 2:31:52.960
 is probably a good thing to do.

2:31:52.960 --> 2:31:53.780
 Yeah.

2:31:53.780 --> 2:31:56.560
 To truly listen.

2:31:56.560 --> 2:31:57.760
 It's like, are you okay?

2:31:57.760 --> 2:31:59.480
 Yeah, yeah.

2:31:59.480 --> 2:32:01.000
 Because people have, you know,

2:32:01.000 --> 2:32:03.720
 this whole thing of like cries for help, man.

2:32:03.720 --> 2:32:06.560
 Sometimes they just look like a weird text.

2:32:06.560 --> 2:32:08.240
 You know, and you don't realize

2:32:08.240 --> 2:32:10.000
 for the person to send that fucking text,

2:32:10.000 --> 2:32:12.100
 they've been thinking about it all morning.

2:32:12.100 --> 2:32:14.920
 They've been just trying to get their phone up

2:32:14.920 --> 2:32:16.440
 from the floor.

2:32:16.440 --> 2:32:20.040
 So, you know, I think that's it.

2:32:20.040 --> 2:32:21.800
 I mean, what, I don't know.

2:32:21.800 --> 2:32:22.760
 I don't know.

2:32:22.760 --> 2:32:25.920
 I've had friends like kill themselves.

2:32:25.920 --> 2:32:29.120
 And many of them, it wasn't like,

2:32:29.120 --> 2:32:31.360
 sadly it was like, I don't know.

2:32:31.360 --> 2:32:32.440
 I don't know what could have been done,

2:32:32.440 --> 2:32:34.000
 but.

2:32:34.000 --> 2:32:37.760
 But there's still a guilt in the back of your head?

2:32:37.760 --> 2:32:39.240
 For the rest of my life, for sure.

2:32:39.240 --> 2:32:40.220
 I always will be.

2:32:41.940 --> 2:32:43.080
 Yeah, I mean, yeah.

2:32:43.080 --> 2:32:44.680
 But again, what are you gonna do?

2:32:44.680 --> 2:32:46.720
 But even that, it's a part of love.

2:32:48.800 --> 2:32:49.800
 That's right.

2:32:49.800 --> 2:32:50.760
 That's right.

2:32:50.760 --> 2:32:51.600
 Yeah, that's right.

2:32:51.600 --> 2:32:52.440
 You could, yeah.

2:32:52.440 --> 2:32:54.040
 You know, we feel guilt.

2:32:54.040 --> 2:32:55.800
 Part of grief is guilt, you know?

2:32:55.800 --> 2:32:58.480
 Like we always could have been better people.

2:32:58.480 --> 2:33:00.360
 We always could have been better people.

2:33:00.360 --> 2:33:02.200
 You getting to Viktor Frankl much?

2:33:02.200 --> 2:33:03.200
 Yeah, of course.

2:33:03.200 --> 2:33:04.520
 Man's search for meaning.

2:33:05.860 --> 2:33:10.860
 The invitation to live your life

2:33:11.320 --> 2:33:13.520
 as though you'd been on your death bed

2:33:13.520 --> 2:33:15.560
 and had been given the chance to go back

2:33:15.560 --> 2:33:18.000
 and not make the same mistakes.

2:33:18.000 --> 2:33:20.760
 I return to that idea all the time,

2:33:20.760 --> 2:33:22.400
 meaning it's like, okay,

2:33:22.400 --> 2:33:27.400
 whatever you did before this moment was too late.

2:33:28.160 --> 2:33:31.120
 But now, you know, this is where you can start.

2:33:31.120 --> 2:33:32.400
 This is where you can start.

2:33:32.400 --> 2:33:37.400
 And yeah, so I think that for a neurotic like me,

2:33:38.160 --> 2:33:39.120
 that's super important.

2:33:39.120 --> 2:33:41.380
 Because otherwise, I'll just get like too lost

2:33:41.380 --> 2:33:44.600
 in the weeds of shitty things I did in the past.

2:33:44.600 --> 2:33:46.080
 So speaking of Viktor Frankl,

2:33:46.080 --> 2:33:48.400
 you and Hitler have the same birthday.

2:33:48.400 --> 2:33:50.680
 Oh my God, you've really done your research.

2:33:52.240 --> 2:33:55.680
 Well, I often Google famous people

2:33:55.680 --> 2:33:58.720
 that have a birthday same as Hitler.

2:33:58.720 --> 2:33:59.560
 Yeah.

2:33:59.560 --> 2:34:02.120
 The person that shows up, you know,

2:34:02.120 --> 2:34:04.640
 is your face just really big.

2:34:04.640 --> 2:34:08.000
 You and Hitler together, just pals next to each other.

2:34:08.000 --> 2:34:10.000
 No, it does not.

2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:12.920
 No, but April 20th is an embarrassing birthday

2:34:12.920 --> 2:34:14.600
 for all my 420 friends out there.

2:34:14.600 --> 2:34:15.440
 It's embarrassing.

2:34:15.440 --> 2:34:17.520
 You share a birthday with Hitler.

2:34:17.520 --> 2:34:20.240
 Well, it's 420s also has a humor

2:34:20.240 --> 2:34:23.100
 and a lightness to it, right?

2:34:23.100 --> 2:34:24.320
 It's embarrassing.

2:34:24.320 --> 2:34:27.240
 Your life is embarrassing.

2:34:27.240 --> 2:34:31.080
 But if you like weed and you're born on stoner day

2:34:31.080 --> 2:34:34.120
 and you believe in reincarnation,

2:34:34.120 --> 2:34:36.520
 do you realize like when you start connecting the dots there,

2:34:36.520 --> 2:34:39.720
 if there is like a Bardo where you get to choose

2:34:39.720 --> 2:34:41.040
 your next life.

2:34:41.040 --> 2:34:45.040
 So you're like a shitty generic NPC.

2:34:45.040 --> 2:34:48.800
 You're like, of course, you would be born on 420.

2:34:48.800 --> 2:34:53.800
 Dude, let me be born on 420, man, yeah.

2:34:53.800 --> 2:34:57.040
 But isn't it interesting that on that same day,

2:34:57.040 --> 2:34:58.580
 Hitler is also born.

2:35:00.080 --> 2:35:05.080
 There's a tension to that and that Hitler's an artist.

2:35:06.760 --> 2:35:11.760
 So it's like that hippie mindset could go anywhere.

2:35:12.080 --> 2:35:12.920
 Oh, yeah, right.

2:35:12.920 --> 2:35:14.080
 Like, yeah, you know,

2:35:14.080 --> 2:35:15.960
 and I was just having this conversation

2:35:15.960 --> 2:35:18.860
 with a friend of mine who's a wonderful skeptic.

2:35:18.860 --> 2:35:22.200
 And we were talking about this,

2:35:22.200 --> 2:35:27.200
 which is the thing where you start attributing to the day

2:35:28.360 --> 2:35:31.080
 you were born, these kinds of significance.

2:35:31.080 --> 2:35:33.320
 And based on maybe people who were born on that day,

2:35:33.320 --> 2:35:34.960
 maybe some other things.

2:35:34.960 --> 2:35:38.040
 And, you know, it's like, think of how many people by now

2:35:38.040 --> 2:35:42.360
 in the course of human history have been born on April 20th.

2:35:42.360 --> 2:35:44.160
 I mean, how many?

2:35:44.160 --> 2:35:45.440
 Someone could probably do the math

2:35:45.440 --> 2:35:47.920
 and come up with some number close to it.

2:35:47.920 --> 2:35:51.880
 Now, this is how you know how rotten Hitler is.

2:35:51.880 --> 2:35:53.600
 Like, he's the one that, like,

2:35:53.600 --> 2:35:56.840
 fucks up the birthday for everybody else.

2:35:56.840 --> 2:35:57.920
 But.

2:35:57.920 --> 2:36:02.920
 I think where I heard that you're 420 is Wim Hof episode

2:36:03.360 --> 2:36:04.880
 because he's also 420.

2:36:04.880 --> 2:36:05.880
 He's a 420.

2:36:05.880 --> 2:36:09.820
 Yeah, so Hitler beats even Wim Hof.

2:36:09.820 --> 2:36:10.660
 Look.

2:36:10.660 --> 2:36:11.960
 In terms of owning the date.

2:36:11.960 --> 2:36:15.040
 I think if anybody is like,

2:36:15.040 --> 2:36:18.720
 well, obviously there's nothing you can do to like fix it.

2:36:18.720 --> 2:36:20.400
 Hitler fucked up a lot of things.

2:36:20.400 --> 2:36:22.080
 He fucked up that mustache.

2:36:22.080 --> 2:36:23.720
 He fucked up the name Hitler.

2:36:23.720 --> 2:36:25.180
 He fucked up 420.

2:36:25.180 --> 2:36:29.080
 And obviously he caused a horrific Holocaust that,

2:36:29.080 --> 2:36:32.040
 by the way, talk about these reverberations through time

2:36:32.040 --> 2:36:33.200
 that we're still experiencing.

2:36:33.200 --> 2:36:34.280
 I mean, there's still people walking around

2:36:34.280 --> 2:36:36.620
 with fucking tattoos from that motherfucker.

2:36:36.620 --> 2:36:41.400
 So, but, you know, Wim Hof, you know, people like Wim Hof.

2:36:41.400 --> 2:36:45.920
 They're like whatever the opposite of Hitler is, you know?

2:36:45.920 --> 2:36:47.880
 He too is creating ripples in the lake

2:36:47.880 --> 2:36:51.280
 that hopefully respond to that of Hitler.

2:36:51.280 --> 2:36:53.200
 Yeah, very cold fucking lake.

2:36:53.200 --> 2:36:57.560
 And he's in, and yeah, so very, very cold lake

2:36:57.560 --> 2:36:59.920
 that he's happily swimming around in.

2:36:59.920 --> 2:37:04.920
 But yeah, you know, I try not to think about

2:37:05.240 --> 2:37:08.240
 like the Hitler thing on my birthday.

2:37:08.240 --> 2:37:11.120
 Then my dad would just, every birthday he would remind me

2:37:11.120 --> 2:37:12.120
 that Hitler was 420.

2:37:12.120 --> 2:37:14.800
 Do you think all of us are capable of evil?

2:37:14.800 --> 2:37:18.240
 Do you think, you're one of the sweetest people I know,

2:37:18.240 --> 2:37:21.000
 just as a fan, do you think you're capable of evil?

2:37:21.000 --> 2:37:24.520
 Sure, yeah, I mean, sure, definitely.

2:37:24.520 --> 2:37:27.900
 I think if you don't think that, you better watch out

2:37:27.900 --> 2:37:31.540
 because come on, how do you think you're not capable of evil?

2:37:31.540 --> 2:37:34.280
 And PS, you are, if you're connected

2:37:34.280 --> 2:37:38.420
 to the supply chain, friend, you're doing evil.

2:37:38.420 --> 2:37:39.920
 You're paying taxes.

2:37:39.920 --> 2:37:43.680
 You're like, you're supporting the worst things in the world.

2:37:43.680 --> 2:37:47.520
 I mean, you know, like diffusion of responsibility,

2:37:47.520 --> 2:37:51.480
 it's really curious or the circumference of responsibility

2:37:51.480 --> 2:37:54.280
 where it's like bombs are going off somewhere

2:37:54.280 --> 2:37:59.280
 that were paid for in some small part by you,

2:38:00.920 --> 2:38:05.920
 some fractional, if an American, if a drone is flying over

2:38:07.000 --> 2:38:10.560
 a village in Afghanistan and drops a bomb

2:38:10.560 --> 2:38:14.040
 and you pay taxes, then you could say you have

2:38:14.040 --> 2:38:18.800
 fractional ownership over that drone.

2:38:18.800 --> 2:38:22.080
 You're a cog in the machine of evil in some sense.

2:38:22.080 --> 2:38:24.400
 And I know what you're gonna say,

2:38:24.400 --> 2:38:26.400
 well, yeah, but I have to fucking pay taxes.

2:38:26.400 --> 2:38:27.320
 Like I have no choice.

2:38:27.320 --> 2:38:29.760
 There's sales tax, there's this or that.

2:38:29.760 --> 2:38:31.940
 Take that attitude.

2:38:31.940 --> 2:38:34.620
 It's the same thing that people on the battlefield

2:38:34.620 --> 2:38:37.580
 when they're sending missiles into other tanks,

2:38:37.580 --> 2:38:39.000
 they're thinking the same thing.

2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:42.280
 It's just, they're more directly responsible

2:38:42.280 --> 2:38:43.240
 for what's going on.

2:38:43.240 --> 2:38:48.240
 But in Buddhism, this idea of dependent co arising

2:38:49.040 --> 2:38:50.600
 or yeah, dependent co arising.

2:38:50.600 --> 2:38:51.440
 We're all connected.

2:38:51.440 --> 2:38:53.560
 We're all part of this matrix.

2:38:53.560 --> 2:38:54.580
 We're all connected,

2:38:54.580 --> 2:38:57.600
 meaning we all share responsibility

2:38:57.600 --> 2:38:58.680
 for the evil in the world.

2:38:58.680 --> 2:39:03.380
 So even if you aren't directly committing evil acts,

2:39:03.380 --> 2:39:05.640
 if you're seeing something in the world

2:39:05.640 --> 2:39:08.200
 and you're thinking that's evil,

2:39:08.200 --> 2:39:10.640
 you're probably not quite as separated from that

2:39:10.640 --> 2:39:11.760
 as you'd like to believe

2:39:11.760 --> 2:39:16.760
 in some tiny infinitesimally quantum way, you're connected.

2:39:19.240 --> 2:39:23.160
 And there is a sense, I've gotten to experience this

2:39:23.160 --> 2:39:25.200
 over and over that one individual

2:39:25.200 --> 2:39:28.200
 can actually make a gigantic difference.

2:39:28.200 --> 2:39:33.200
 And so not only is there a diffusion responsibility,

2:39:33.380 --> 2:39:37.320
 there's a kind of a paralysis about, well, what can I do?

2:39:37.320 --> 2:39:38.480
 Yeah.

2:39:38.480 --> 2:39:40.920
 Sure, I understand, but what can I do?

2:39:40.920 --> 2:39:44.980
 And I think just looking at history

2:39:46.120 --> 2:39:50.040
 and also hanging out and becoming friends,

2:39:50.040 --> 2:39:51.520
 but also interviewing people

2:39:51.520 --> 2:39:52.940
 that have had a tremendous impact,

2:39:52.940 --> 2:39:55.520
 you realize you're just one dude.

2:39:55.520 --> 2:39:56.340
 Yeah.

2:39:56.340 --> 2:39:58.640
 You're like a normal person.

2:39:58.640 --> 2:40:00.360
 You're not that smart even.

2:40:00.360 --> 2:40:04.280
 Like a lot of people aren't like in some kind of magical way

2:40:04.280 --> 2:40:07.280
 where you have a big head that's figuring out everything.

2:40:07.280 --> 2:40:12.080
 No, you just saw problems in the world

2:40:12.080 --> 2:40:13.200
 and you're like, hey,

2:40:13.200 --> 2:40:15.200
 I think I'm gonna try to do something about this.

2:40:15.200 --> 2:40:16.040
 Yeah.

2:40:16.040 --> 2:40:17.320
 And you stay focused and dedicated to it

2:40:17.320 --> 2:40:21.040
 for a prolonged period of time and refuse to quit,

2:40:21.040 --> 2:40:23.040
 refuse to listen to people that tell you

2:40:23.040 --> 2:40:24.760
 that this isn't like impossible,

2:40:24.760 --> 2:40:26.280
 here's how others have failed.

2:40:26.280 --> 2:40:27.120
 Yeah.

2:40:27.120 --> 2:40:29.080
 No, I'm gonna do it.

2:40:29.080 --> 2:40:30.260
 That's it.

2:40:30.260 --> 2:40:31.100
 That's it.

2:40:31.100 --> 2:40:32.640
 And one person, and then you kind of,

2:40:32.640 --> 2:40:34.600
 the thing is when there's one person

2:40:34.600 --> 2:40:36.620
 that keeps pushing forward that way,

2:40:36.620 --> 2:40:38.000
 there's, humans are sticky.

2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:40.280
 They, other people follow them around

2:40:40.280 --> 2:40:42.320
 and they're like, I'll help.

2:40:42.320 --> 2:40:45.480
 You know, I'll help and then the other people help

2:40:45.480 --> 2:40:47.740
 and then the cool people all gather together

2:40:47.740 --> 2:40:49.800
 cause they kind of get excited about this way.

2:40:49.800 --> 2:40:52.080
 Holy shit, we can actually make a difference.

2:40:52.080 --> 2:40:53.720
 And they, they form groups

2:40:53.720 --> 2:40:56.040
 and then all of a sudden there's companies and nations

2:40:56.040 --> 2:40:58.240
 that actually make a gigantic difference.

2:40:58.240 --> 2:40:59.080
 It's interesting.

2:40:59.080 --> 2:41:01.840
 And it all starts with one person often.

2:41:01.840 --> 2:41:02.680
 You know what?

2:41:02.680 --> 2:41:04.620
 If I could push back slightly against that,

2:41:04.620 --> 2:41:06.040
 it's never just one person.

2:41:06.040 --> 2:41:09.920
 It's like, you know, nobody ever talks about,

2:41:09.920 --> 2:41:11.320
 at least as far as I'm aware,

2:41:11.320 --> 2:41:14.620
 you never hear about like Buddha's great grandmother.

2:41:14.620 --> 2:41:15.800
 You never hear about that.

2:41:15.800 --> 2:41:16.720
 You never hear about that.

2:41:16.720 --> 2:41:20.520
 But if not for that person, no Buddhism.

2:41:20.520 --> 2:41:23.520
 You know, the people you're talking about,

2:41:23.520 --> 2:41:26.240
 they are the tip of the iceberg

2:41:26.240 --> 2:41:29.400
 that pops up out of the ocean of history.

2:41:29.400 --> 2:41:34.280
 And you never see that all the little things

2:41:34.280 --> 2:41:36.440
 that helped that happen.

2:41:36.440 --> 2:41:39.800
 And so to me, this is where the real,

2:41:39.800 --> 2:41:41.300
 like how do you help?

2:41:41.300 --> 2:41:42.940
 What's something you can do?

2:41:42.940 --> 2:41:45.880
 Well, you know, recognize that first,

2:41:45.880 --> 2:41:47.280
 that you don't really, you don't,

2:41:47.280 --> 2:41:48.560
 you might not even be aware

2:41:48.560 --> 2:41:51.000
 of how much you're impacting people around you.

2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:53.280
 You might think that you're not,

2:41:53.280 --> 2:41:55.600
 or you might think surely not in a way

2:41:55.600 --> 2:41:57.380
 that makes a big difference,

2:41:57.380 --> 2:42:01.080
 but you have no idea these tipping points

2:42:01.080 --> 2:42:06.080
 and they can lead to the emergence of an Einstein,

2:42:06.120 --> 2:42:08.760
 a Gandhi, a Martin Luther King.

2:42:08.760 --> 2:42:11.800
 We can go on and on, a Dostoevsky or whoever.

2:42:11.800 --> 2:42:14.160
 And so I think that's where for me,

2:42:14.160 --> 2:42:16.680
 it goes back to tend to the part of the garden

2:42:16.680 --> 2:42:21.680
 you can touch and then, or even deeper than that intention.

2:42:22.520 --> 2:42:24.720
 It was just like an, I'm an idiot.

2:42:24.720 --> 2:42:28.760
 So I need an idiot's intention, which is don't,

2:42:28.760 --> 2:42:31.260
 if you, I heard the Dalai Lama say it.

2:42:33.120 --> 2:42:36.020
 If you can help, help.

2:42:36.020 --> 2:42:38.700
 If you can't help, don't hurt.

2:42:38.700 --> 2:42:43.280
 Simple, basic dummy rules so that you can,

2:42:43.280 --> 2:42:46.520
 if possible, refrain from hurting,

2:42:46.520 --> 2:42:49.440
 which might as well be a form of helping.

2:42:50.520 --> 2:42:53.420
 And the help doesn't have to be this dramatic thing.

2:42:53.420 --> 2:42:56.060
 These little acts of kindness.

2:42:56.060 --> 2:42:59.580
 I don't know, they seem to have,

2:42:59.580 --> 2:43:01.300
 maybe I believe in kind of karma,

2:43:01.300 --> 2:43:03.040
 but they seem to have this,

2:43:03.040 --> 2:43:05.740
 they can have this gigantic ripple effect.

2:43:05.740 --> 2:43:07.980
 I don't know why that is.

2:43:07.980 --> 2:43:11.740
 I just, I remember a lot of little acts of kindness

2:43:11.740 --> 2:43:15.700
 that people have done to me and they, what do they do?

2:43:16.940 --> 2:43:19.260
 One, they fill me with joy and hope for the future.

2:43:19.260 --> 2:43:21.220
 They give me faith in humanity.

2:43:21.220 --> 2:43:26.220
 That somehow there's a partially dormant desire

2:43:29.700 --> 2:43:31.780
 in our sort of collective intelligence

2:43:31.780 --> 2:43:33.420
 to do good in the world.

2:43:33.420 --> 2:43:36.240
 That most of us want to be good,

2:43:36.240 --> 2:43:38.460
 that want to do good onto the world.

2:43:38.460 --> 2:43:41.500
 I want, there's a kindness that's kind of like

2:43:41.500 --> 2:43:43.820
 begging to get out, you know?

2:43:43.820 --> 2:43:46.060
 And those little acts of kindness do just that.

2:43:46.060 --> 2:43:48.580
 And actually one of the reasons I love Austin

2:43:48.580 --> 2:43:52.100
 and moved here is realizing,

2:43:52.100 --> 2:43:55.380
 just noticing those little acts of kindness all around me,

2:43:55.380 --> 2:43:58.900
 just for stupid reasons, just people being really nice.

2:43:58.900 --> 2:44:03.900
 It's weird and that kindness combined with an optimism

2:44:04.260 --> 2:44:09.260
 for the future, it's just, it's amazing what that can build.

2:44:09.460 --> 2:44:12.160
 Yes, yes, it's incredible.

2:44:12.160 --> 2:44:13.200
 And I know what you're saying.

2:44:13.200 --> 2:44:17.180
 It's like, you know, we moved to this great neighborhood

2:44:17.180 --> 2:44:21.900
 and at this point I think three,

2:44:21.900 --> 2:44:25.540
 maybe four of our neighbors have like made food for us

2:44:25.540 --> 2:44:29.260
 that just shows up with like handwritten lists

2:44:29.260 --> 2:44:31.740
 of like things they like to do in the area

2:44:31.740 --> 2:44:34.140
 and their phone number if we need help.

2:44:34.140 --> 2:44:36.700
 And it's like, holy shit.

2:44:36.700 --> 2:44:40.280
 That's like, it might seem like a little act,

2:44:40.280 --> 2:44:43.380
 but it feels like some kind of atomic love bomb

2:44:43.380 --> 2:44:46.060
 just went off on your porch when you're looking at that.

2:44:46.060 --> 2:44:48.100
 I'm like, what the fuck?

2:44:48.100 --> 2:44:50.740
 You made me a pie?

2:44:50.740 --> 2:44:51.780
 This is incredible.

2:44:51.780 --> 2:44:53.740
 Like, this is incredible, so.

2:44:53.740 --> 2:44:57.740
 And also it's another act to accept that kindness.

2:44:57.740 --> 2:45:01.080
 It's like a lot of times when I was like in Boston

2:45:01.080 --> 2:45:03.740
 or San Francisco, certain big cities,

2:45:03.740 --> 2:45:05.020
 you can think like, oh, okay,

2:45:05.020 --> 2:45:07.040
 well they're trying to like somehow,

2:45:08.780 --> 2:45:10.080
 that's not an act of kindness.

2:45:10.080 --> 2:45:12.860
 That's some kind of a transactional thing to build up.

2:45:12.860 --> 2:45:15.140
 It's like a career move for networking,

2:45:15.140 --> 2:45:16.300
 all that kind of stuff.

2:45:16.300 --> 2:45:18.220
 But no, if you just accept it for what it is,

2:45:18.220 --> 2:45:20.140
 a pure act of kindness.

2:45:20.140 --> 2:45:21.460
 Fucking Boston.

2:45:21.460 --> 2:45:22.860
 It's the, yeah.

2:45:22.860 --> 2:45:25.060
 Because for me, I go the opposite route.

2:45:25.060 --> 2:45:26.600
 Because I'm not, even though there is a part of me

2:45:26.600 --> 2:45:29.180
 that might be a little suspicious or something,

2:45:29.180 --> 2:45:33.000
 where I go to push that shit back mentally

2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:34.860
 is I'm like, I don't deserve this.

2:45:34.860 --> 2:45:37.520
 If they knew what a piece of shit I am.

2:45:37.520 --> 2:45:38.360
 You're gonna bring me,

2:45:38.360 --> 2:45:40.500
 I don't wanna never bring cakes to my neighbors.

2:45:40.500 --> 2:45:41.740
 I wouldn't know how to make a cake.

2:45:41.740 --> 2:45:42.780
 I don't know how to make anything.

2:45:42.780 --> 2:45:43.820
 I don't have time.

2:45:43.820 --> 2:45:45.380
 I should be bringing shit to my neighbors.

2:45:45.380 --> 2:45:46.300
 Why didn't I do that?

2:45:46.300 --> 2:45:48.900
 I should have brought, I never do that.

2:45:48.900 --> 2:45:50.500
 If you're not careful,

2:45:50.500 --> 2:45:54.580
 you can spiral into a vortex of self hate from the gift.

2:45:54.580 --> 2:45:56.300
 So you have to, yeah, you have to learn how to,

2:45:56.300 --> 2:46:01.020
 in that circuitry, you have to learn how to like accept.

2:46:01.020 --> 2:46:03.020
 Oh yeah, I have that problem really big.

2:46:03.020 --> 2:46:05.660
 Yeah, like I don't deserve this.

2:46:06.940 --> 2:46:10.300
 Like I don't, I get so much love from people.

2:46:10.300 --> 2:46:11.860
 I'm like, well, yeah, they love me

2:46:11.860 --> 2:46:13.400
 because they don't know me.

2:46:13.400 --> 2:46:15.260
 That's my brain, my little voice.

2:46:15.260 --> 2:46:19.140
 Like you're not, you're not worthy.

2:46:19.980 --> 2:46:23.900
 You're not worthy of any of this kindness

2:46:23.900 --> 2:46:24.860
 and all this kind of stuff.

2:46:24.860 --> 2:46:28.500
 And that could be very, yeah, it can shut you down.

2:46:28.500 --> 2:46:30.140
 It can be debilitating.

2:46:30.140 --> 2:46:32.100
 And also it shuts the person down.

2:46:32.100 --> 2:46:32.940
 I mean, you're talking.

2:46:32.940 --> 2:46:36.140
 And that's the dark side is it pushes them away too.

2:46:36.140 --> 2:46:40.020
 Yeah, it cuts off this fucking mystical circuitry.

2:46:40.020 --> 2:46:43.460
 So like the best thing if that happens to you

2:46:43.460 --> 2:46:46.300
 is like accept it joyfully.

2:46:46.300 --> 2:46:48.140
 And just even, just all that,

2:46:48.140 --> 2:46:50.340
 whatever that thing inside of you,

2:46:50.340 --> 2:46:52.660
 whatever that little thing is, you know,

2:46:52.660 --> 2:46:56.100
 this is like in the meditation I do,

2:46:56.100 --> 2:46:58.240
 it's an infuriatingly simple meditation,

2:46:58.240 --> 2:47:01.660
 but when a thought emerges,

2:47:01.660 --> 2:47:03.940
 when you are resting your attention on your breath

2:47:03.940 --> 2:47:07.300
 and then inevitably you think, you get lost in your thoughts.

2:47:07.300 --> 2:47:09.340
 And when you catch yourself doing that,

2:47:09.340 --> 2:47:11.740
 you think thinking,

2:47:11.740 --> 2:47:13.500
 and then return your attention to the breath.

2:47:13.500 --> 2:47:17.060
 So I like that so that when that part of myself starts,

2:47:17.060 --> 2:47:20.140
 you know, having its little neurotic semi seizure,

2:47:20.140 --> 2:47:22.340
 I can just go thinking, whatever.

2:47:22.340 --> 2:47:23.460
 It's just another thought.

2:47:23.460 --> 2:47:26.980
 And then eat the, eat the, eat the banana bread

2:47:26.980 --> 2:47:28.700
 or whatever they gave you.

2:47:28.700 --> 2:47:31.780
 What's the most wild psychedelic experience

2:47:31.780 --> 2:47:34.540
 you've ever had in a dream, in a vision?

2:47:34.540 --> 2:47:36.700
 It doesn't have to be drug related.

2:47:36.700 --> 2:47:40.020
 What's one that jumps to mind

2:47:40.020 --> 2:47:42.740
 that was like, holy shit, I'm happy to be alive.

2:47:42.740 --> 2:47:43.820
 Is this life?

2:47:43.820 --> 2:47:45.220
 Okay. This is amazing.

2:47:45.220 --> 2:47:46.900
 Yeah, the, oh yeah, okay.

2:47:46.900 --> 2:47:51.580
 So the one that pops to mind,

2:47:51.580 --> 2:47:54.040
 I've had a lot of psychedelic experiences,

2:47:54.040 --> 2:47:56.020
 but in this moment, the one that pops to mind,

2:47:56.020 --> 2:47:58.760
 only because it goes back to what you're talking about,

2:47:58.760 --> 2:48:01.760
 about this Nietzsche's idea of infinite return.

2:48:01.760 --> 2:48:06.760
 The, the, so I'm a Burning Man and.

2:48:08.960 --> 2:48:10.360
 Are you going to Burning Man this time?

2:48:10.360 --> 2:48:11.200
 I'm not.

2:48:11.200 --> 2:48:12.560
 I mean, I have kids right now.

2:48:12.560 --> 2:48:13.600
 I just want to be around them.

2:48:13.600 --> 2:48:15.480
 My wife was being so cool about it

2:48:15.480 --> 2:48:16.720
 and she knows I love Burning Man.

2:48:16.720 --> 2:48:17.800
 She's like, go to Burning Man.

2:48:17.800 --> 2:48:19.120
 And I was going to go.

2:48:19.120 --> 2:48:22.520
 And then I just, I just want to be around my kids

2:48:22.520 --> 2:48:24.240
 as much as I can right now, but.

2:48:24.240 --> 2:48:25.360
 I've never been to Burning Man.

2:48:25.360 --> 2:48:29.200
 So I don't know how secretive it is that, I mean,

2:48:29.200 --> 2:48:31.580
 cause quite high profile folks go.

2:48:31.580 --> 2:48:34.040
 Yeah, everyone knows Elon Musk goes there.

2:48:34.040 --> 2:48:35.280
 Isn't it pretty open?

2:48:35.280 --> 2:48:36.180
 He's got a boat.

2:48:37.240 --> 2:48:38.080
 You know that?

2:48:38.080 --> 2:48:39.600
 I'm touching none of this.

2:48:39.600 --> 2:48:41.280
 You know, there's a, it's called art cars.

2:48:41.280 --> 2:48:42.280
 They all make art cars.

2:48:42.280 --> 2:48:44.600
 And like part of the, part of the burn,

2:48:44.600 --> 2:48:47.600
 what's so beautiful about it is like,

2:48:47.600 --> 2:48:49.280
 you can't buy anything there, man.

2:48:49.280 --> 2:48:53.680
 Like you, I've heard, I don't know if this has changed.

2:48:53.680 --> 2:48:55.520
 It's been a bit because of the pandemic,

2:48:55.520 --> 2:48:59.200
 but the only thing you could buy was ice and coffee.

2:48:59.200 --> 2:49:01.240
 And I think maybe that's changed.

2:49:01.240 --> 2:49:02.840
 I heard some whisper that that's changed,

2:49:02.840 --> 2:49:07.400
 but so that means that it's a gifting economy

2:49:07.400 --> 2:49:08.240
 is what they call it.

2:49:08.240 --> 2:49:11.000
 And so people will just give you stuff.

2:49:11.000 --> 2:49:13.560
 Talk about having to struggle with deserving stuff, man.

2:49:13.560 --> 2:49:17.160
 What are you going to fucking do when the camp next to you

2:49:17.160 --> 2:49:20.620
 is like every morning making the best iced coffee

2:49:20.620 --> 2:49:22.200
 that you've ever had in your life.

2:49:22.200 --> 2:49:25.880
 And they just are giving it all away till it's all gone.

2:49:25.880 --> 2:49:27.000
 What are you going to do?

2:49:27.000 --> 2:49:30.080
 It's, it's the best ever.

2:49:30.080 --> 2:49:31.680
 And then you're giving things to people.

2:49:31.680 --> 2:49:34.320
 And then you, you learn stuff like,

2:49:34.320 --> 2:49:36.900
 you learn these really interesting lessons.

2:49:36.900 --> 2:49:39.880
 Like one of the times I went there,

2:49:40.960 --> 2:49:44.720
 got all these strawberries.

2:49:44.720 --> 2:49:46.120
 Might not sound like a big deal,

2:49:46.120 --> 2:49:48.640
 but when you're out there in the dust

2:49:48.640 --> 2:49:50.080
 and you're not at one of like the,

2:49:50.080 --> 2:49:52.440
 like hardcore like luxury camps,

2:49:52.440 --> 2:49:53.800
 which do exist out there,

2:49:55.800 --> 2:49:58.000
 you know, you've got these like items where in my mind,

2:49:58.000 --> 2:50:00.440
 I'm like, yeah, these are going to be just for me

2:50:00.440 --> 2:50:03.760
 and my girlfriend, my special stash fruit

2:50:03.760 --> 2:50:04.960
 and this or that.

2:50:04.960 --> 2:50:09.360
 And then like two days in you're walking around your camp

2:50:10.280 --> 2:50:12.880
 with the strawberries that you were coveting

2:50:12.880 --> 2:50:16.380
 and everyone's so happy to get like cold strawberries

2:50:16.380 --> 2:50:17.920
 and you've realized, oh my God,

2:50:17.920 --> 2:50:21.320
 this feels so much better than the way a strawberry tastes.

2:50:21.320 --> 2:50:25.040
 So you learn something experientially there,

2:50:25.040 --> 2:50:27.040
 which is an incredible thing.

2:50:27.040 --> 2:50:29.080
 It's an incredible thing.

2:50:29.080 --> 2:50:31.840
 Man, now I'm wishing I had decided to go to Burning Man.

2:50:31.840 --> 2:50:32.880
 Have you been a few times?

2:50:32.880 --> 2:50:34.820
 Yeah, I just know like,

2:50:36.120 --> 2:50:39.200
 at least people were saying it was Elon Musk's boat.

2:50:39.200 --> 2:50:41.040
 Like, yeah, like this, I think it was like,

2:50:41.040 --> 2:50:43.560
 it's like this massive, it's art cars.

2:50:43.560 --> 2:50:45.260
 And it was this party on this thing.

2:50:45.260 --> 2:50:48.560
 You could just, anyone can go on the boat.

2:50:48.560 --> 2:50:50.920
 Like no one's like, there's no guest list.

2:50:50.920 --> 2:50:52.240
 You just go on there.

2:50:52.240 --> 2:50:53.680
 I never saw him there, but that, you know,

2:50:53.680 --> 2:50:56.400
 everyone's whispering Elon Musk is here.

2:50:56.400 --> 2:50:58.320
 There's a secrecy, there's all that kind of stuff

2:50:58.320 --> 2:50:59.720
 because you'd probably have to respect that.

2:50:59.720 --> 2:51:01.120
 But at the same time there,

2:51:01.120 --> 2:51:03.520
 it seems like the kind of people that go there,

2:51:04.520 --> 2:51:09.520
 I mean, the rules of the outside world are suspended

2:51:09.840 --> 2:51:14.840
 in the sense that the crime, the aggression,

2:51:17.180 --> 2:51:19.860
 the tensions, all of that seems to dissipate somehow.

2:51:19.860 --> 2:51:22.100
 Not all the way, not all the way.

2:51:22.100 --> 2:51:25.920
 That, you know, you could look it up, you know,

2:51:25.920 --> 2:51:27.080
 cause like there is tension.

2:51:27.080 --> 2:51:29.480
 There's a lot of tension there between,

2:51:30.760 --> 2:51:32.160
 it's called plug and plays.

2:51:32.160 --> 2:51:34.160
 Like, you know, Burning Man,

2:51:34.160 --> 2:51:36.880
 like the history of Burning Man is fascinating.

2:51:36.880 --> 2:51:41.480
 It has its roots in the cacophony society

2:51:41.480 --> 2:51:42.320
 is what it was called,

2:51:42.320 --> 2:51:45.840
 which is a sort of evolution of something that was,

2:51:45.840 --> 2:51:50.540
 I think it was called the God, like the San Francisco.

2:51:50.540 --> 2:51:54.360
 Basically there was like an art movement in San Francisco.

2:51:54.360 --> 2:51:55.560
 And I can't remember the name of it.

2:51:55.560 --> 2:51:59.040
 Maybe the Suicide Club or essentially like,

2:51:59.920 --> 2:52:02.360
 they were really into urban exploration

2:52:02.360 --> 2:52:05.720
 and meaning like breaking into like

2:52:05.720 --> 2:52:07.860
 old abandoned buildings and stuff.

2:52:07.860 --> 2:52:11.040
 But part of this, what this was, was

2:52:13.240 --> 2:52:15.680
 you would prepare your life

2:52:15.680 --> 2:52:18.000
 as though you were going to kill yourself.

2:52:18.000 --> 2:52:19.840
 You would get all your affairs in order.

2:52:19.840 --> 2:52:22.280
 You would get, so it's going back to what we were talking

2:52:22.280 --> 2:52:23.440
 about with the cancer diagnosis.

2:52:23.440 --> 2:52:27.960
 You're like sort of putting yourself into that world

2:52:27.960 --> 2:52:29.520
 of like, I'm going to get all my affairs together

2:52:29.520 --> 2:52:30.360
 as though this is it.

2:52:30.360 --> 2:52:31.960
 And then there was some,

2:52:31.960 --> 2:52:33.800
 I'm sorry for anyone listening if I'm butchering this,

2:52:33.800 --> 2:52:35.840
 but I think there was some really cool initiation

2:52:35.840 --> 2:52:37.600
 where they would blindfold you

2:52:37.600 --> 2:52:38.560
 and they would take you into

2:52:38.560 --> 2:52:40.560
 some of these abandoned buildings.

2:52:40.560 --> 2:52:41.940
 And you didn't know where you were walking,

2:52:41.940 --> 2:52:42.780
 but they would say like,

2:52:42.780 --> 2:52:47.060
 if you take one step to the left, you're going to die.

2:52:47.060 --> 2:52:48.080
 You're going to fall off.

2:52:48.080 --> 2:52:48.900
 You're going to fall.

2:52:48.900 --> 2:52:50.140
 So please be careful.

2:52:50.140 --> 2:52:52.520
 So you're like in the moment

2:52:52.520 --> 2:52:53.920
 and then blindfold comes off.

2:52:53.920 --> 2:52:55.640
 It's a big, awesome party.

2:52:55.640 --> 2:52:58.960
 This evolves into something called the Cacophony Society.

2:52:58.960 --> 2:52:59.840
 There's a great book called

2:52:59.840 --> 2:53:02.540
 Tales of the Cacophony Society for people listening.

2:53:04.080 --> 2:53:07.760
 One of the members of the Cacophony Society

2:53:07.760 --> 2:53:09.880
 was the author of Fight Club.

2:53:09.880 --> 2:53:11.640
 And so if you've seen Fight Club,

2:53:11.640 --> 2:53:13.200
 like you could see little ideas

2:53:13.200 --> 2:53:14.920
 that were in the Cacophony Society.

2:53:14.920 --> 2:53:19.920
 They were into Dadaism, which I don't know a lot about.

2:53:19.920 --> 2:53:23.120
 I don't know, but it's a philosophical art movement.

2:53:24.640 --> 2:53:27.800
 And then so basically what was happening is like,

2:53:27.800 --> 2:53:30.920
 they kept burning increasingly large effigies

2:53:30.920 --> 2:53:34.280
 in San Francisco and they weren't allowed to do it.

2:53:34.280 --> 2:53:36.360
 And so they took it out in the desert

2:53:36.360 --> 2:53:40.720
 and they were basing it on something called a zone trip,

2:53:40.720 --> 2:53:43.660
 which is like, across this border,

2:53:43.660 --> 2:53:46.200
 the rules of that old society are gone.

2:53:46.200 --> 2:53:50.040
 And so that was the original Burning Man,

2:53:50.040 --> 2:53:55.040
 which was these lunatics out in the desert,

2:53:55.080 --> 2:53:59.600
 launching like burning pianos out of catapults

2:53:59.600 --> 2:54:03.320
 through the air doing like drive by shooting ranges,

2:54:03.320 --> 2:54:08.320
 like no rules, wild, magical, beautiful, insane madness.

2:54:09.680 --> 2:54:14.440
 And then it grew and grew and grew and grew

2:54:14.440 --> 2:54:17.280
 until you have Burning Man as it is today,

2:54:17.280 --> 2:54:19.440
 which is still the most incredible thing.

2:54:19.440 --> 2:54:22.000
 I mean, obviously anytime you have like a thing

2:54:22.000 --> 2:54:24.420
 that's been around for a while, you're gonna get that.

2:54:24.420 --> 2:54:26.280
 It's not like it used to be.

2:54:26.280 --> 2:54:28.180
 It's not as free as it used to be, so this or that.

2:54:28.180 --> 2:54:30.220
 But what's fascinating about Burning Man,

2:54:30.220 --> 2:54:33.340
 someone pointed this out to me, look on the ground,

2:54:34.480 --> 2:54:37.800
 no trash, no cigarettes.

2:54:37.800 --> 2:54:40.320
 The ethic of like picking up your shit there

2:54:40.320 --> 2:54:42.400
 is like so intense.

2:54:42.400 --> 2:54:44.760
 So it's not like the other festivals you go to

2:54:44.760 --> 2:54:46.520
 where there's just trash everywhere,

2:54:46.520 --> 2:54:48.440
 shit scattered everywhere.

2:54:48.440 --> 2:54:49.360
 It's clean.

2:54:49.360 --> 2:54:51.440
 People are picking up their stuff.

2:54:51.440 --> 2:54:54.520
 People are like really being conscious

2:54:54.520 --> 2:54:56.440
 of like not fucking up the playa.

2:54:56.440 --> 2:55:01.440
 So I'm sorry, don't get a burner yapping about Burning Man.

2:55:01.440 --> 2:55:02.800
 We won't stop.

2:55:02.800 --> 2:55:03.720
 It'll be morning.

2:55:03.720 --> 2:55:05.640
 But there's a power,

2:55:05.640 --> 2:55:08.840
 but there is a power to culture propagating itself

2:55:08.840 --> 2:55:10.880
 through to the stories that we tell each other.

2:55:10.880 --> 2:55:14.440
 And that holds up for Burning Man.

2:55:14.440 --> 2:55:16.880
 It's clear that the culture has stayed strong

2:55:16.880 --> 2:55:18.200
 throughout the years.

2:55:18.200 --> 2:55:22.080
 So many people, so many really interesting people

2:55:23.240 --> 2:55:28.240
 speak of Burning Man as like a sacred place they go to

2:55:28.760 --> 2:55:31.520
 to remind themselves about what's important.

2:55:31.520 --> 2:55:32.560
 That's so interesting.

2:55:32.560 --> 2:55:33.560
 And it is.

2:55:33.560 --> 2:55:34.400
 And it is.

2:55:34.400 --> 2:55:36.240
 I mean, it's like, you know, there are all these stories

2:55:36.240 --> 2:55:38.240
 of like, I love guru stories.

2:55:38.240 --> 2:55:39.080
 I have a guru.

2:55:39.080 --> 2:55:42.280
 I'm Karoli Baba, never met him, he was Ram Dass's guru,

2:55:42.280 --> 2:55:43.720
 at least not in the flesh.

2:55:43.720 --> 2:55:46.600
 But the story of the guru is if you're lucky,

2:55:46.600 --> 2:55:48.880
 you meet this being that,

2:55:48.880 --> 2:55:50.320
 and we're not talking about, you know,

2:55:50.320 --> 2:55:54.240
 whatever the run of the mill, like charlatans out there.

2:55:54.240 --> 2:55:59.240
 Like I know for sure that people are in the world right now

2:56:00.280 --> 2:56:05.280
 who when you're around them,

2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:07.000
 the thing you're talking about,

2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:10.520
 the affirmation of the potential of humanity

2:56:10.520 --> 2:56:12.640
 and also just an acceptance of yourself

2:56:12.640 --> 2:56:14.600
 and, you know, cultivate,

2:56:14.600 --> 2:56:19.240
 like seeing someone who's cultivated love or compassion

2:56:19.240 --> 2:56:21.160
 or whatever, but in this way that is,

2:56:24.000 --> 2:56:25.440
 I mean, you would almost,

2:56:26.720 --> 2:56:28.440
 you would rather meet that being

2:56:28.440 --> 2:56:30.440
 than like a UFO land in your backyard.

2:56:30.440 --> 2:56:31.840
 It's like, it is the UFO.

2:56:31.840 --> 2:56:33.720
 It's a person, but it's not.

2:56:33.720 --> 2:56:35.920
 It's everybody and nobody.

2:56:35.920 --> 2:56:40.560
 And somehow they like end up conveying to you

2:56:42.120 --> 2:56:45.200
 ideas that you may have heard a million times before,

2:56:45.200 --> 2:56:49.360
 but somehow within the language itself is a transmission

2:56:49.360 --> 2:56:52.280
 that permanently alters you.

2:56:52.280 --> 2:56:54.800
 And so these people exist.

2:56:54.800 --> 2:56:57.120
 I think you could argue that Burning Man,

2:56:58.480 --> 2:57:01.640
 the total thing is a guru,

2:57:01.640 --> 2:57:04.800
 that a pilgrimage is involved to get there.

2:57:04.800 --> 2:57:08.240
 You, like, it's not easy to get there.

2:57:08.240 --> 2:57:12.760
 And when you get there, it's gonna teach you something.

2:57:12.760 --> 2:57:14.200
 It's gonna show you something.

2:57:14.200 --> 2:57:17.680
 It's going to, and maybe some of the stuff it shows you

2:57:17.680 --> 2:57:22.680
 might not be great, but the community around you

2:57:22.960 --> 2:57:27.160
 will like, will hold you as you're like,

2:57:27.160 --> 2:57:29.240
 whatever the thing is that's coming out of you

2:57:29.240 --> 2:57:30.120
 is coming out of you.

2:57:30.120 --> 2:57:31.600
 And even the simplest activities,

2:57:31.600 --> 2:57:35.920
 the simplest exchange of words have like,

2:57:35.920 --> 2:57:40.920
 just like the gurus, a profound impact somehow.

2:57:41.160 --> 2:57:42.520
 Something about that place.

2:57:42.520 --> 2:57:46.440
 Yeah, not to mention the insane synchronicities,

2:57:46.440 --> 2:57:48.800
 like insane synchronicities there.

2:57:48.800 --> 2:57:51.760
 And I think like, you know, to get back to the notion

2:57:51.760 --> 2:57:56.760
 of sentience as a byproduct of a harmonized

2:57:56.760 --> 2:57:58.760
 yet hyper complex system.

2:57:58.760 --> 2:58:03.120
 I think synchronicities, like those kinds of systems

2:58:03.120 --> 2:58:05.240
 are like lightning rods for synchronicity.

2:58:05.240 --> 2:58:10.240
 So crazy, not just because your high synchronicities

2:58:10.960 --> 2:58:13.200
 happen that are impossible,

2:58:13.200 --> 2:58:14.800
 where you just have to deal with it.

2:58:14.800 --> 2:58:16.880
 And like, you'll need something.

2:58:16.880 --> 2:58:19.120
 And within a few minutes, someone's like,

2:58:19.120 --> 2:58:20.720
 oh, here you go.

2:58:20.720 --> 2:58:22.240
 And you mentioned, but by the way,

2:58:22.240 --> 2:58:25.640
 Burning Anchors of a psychedelic experience,

2:58:25.640 --> 2:58:29.280
 is it the strawberries or was it something else?

2:58:29.280 --> 2:58:30.760
 What was the moment?

2:58:30.760 --> 2:58:31.640
 Yeah, that was magical.

2:58:31.640 --> 2:58:32.640
 No, it was DMT.

2:58:32.640 --> 2:58:33.480
 It definitely wasn't.

2:58:33.480 --> 2:58:35.760
 It wasn't strawberries.

2:58:35.760 --> 2:58:36.600
 Ah.

2:58:38.160 --> 2:58:39.760
 No, no, I was.

2:58:39.760 --> 2:58:41.000
 More potent.

2:58:41.000 --> 2:58:43.480
 Yeah, I was like smoking DMT.

2:58:43.480 --> 2:58:48.480
 And like, I saw, like, if you, in the midnight gospel,

2:58:48.480 --> 2:58:53.480
 there are these bovine creatures that have like a long neck

2:58:56.600 --> 2:58:58.600
 and a lantern head.

2:58:58.600 --> 2:59:01.880
 So like, I saw one of those things.

2:59:01.880 --> 2:59:06.880
 And, you know, I thought it was funny and like ridiculous

2:59:11.200 --> 2:59:13.280
 because you hear like all the Terence McKenna stories

2:59:13.280 --> 2:59:16.600
 of the self transforming machine elves

2:59:16.600 --> 2:59:20.720
 or all the purple or the magenta goddess everyone sees.

2:59:20.720 --> 2:59:22.920
 I'm like, so this is what I get?

2:59:22.920 --> 2:59:26.280
 Like a fucking cow with a lantern head?

2:59:26.280 --> 2:59:28.280
 Like that's where my brain is at

2:59:28.280 --> 2:59:30.760
 and we're interacting with this molecule.

2:59:30.760 --> 2:59:35.640
 So then like, I look away.

2:59:38.360 --> 2:59:39.600
 And again, this is DMT.

2:59:39.600 --> 2:59:42.120
 So when I say look away, do I mean with my eyes shut,

2:59:42.120 --> 2:59:46.040
 I look away or eyes open, I look away, I think eyes shut.

2:59:46.040 --> 2:59:47.760
 So it sounds weird to say look away,

2:59:47.760 --> 2:59:51.920
 but however you want to put it, that's what I did.

2:59:51.920 --> 2:59:54.920
 And I look back and it's still there.

2:59:54.920 --> 2:59:57.040
 Only now it's, you know, cause usually in like,

2:59:57.040 --> 2:59:58.960
 when you're having those kinds of visions,

2:59:58.960 --> 3:00:01.240
 they go away pretty quickly.

3:00:01.240 --> 3:00:04.280
 This thing's like moved, like shambled ahead

3:00:04.280 --> 3:00:08.280
 and maybe a few steps, just like a cow, just like a cow.

3:00:08.280 --> 3:00:12.040
 And then that was when the, you know,

3:00:12.040 --> 3:00:13.320
 all the stories you hear about it,

3:00:13.320 --> 3:00:15.920
 like going through some kind of tuber,

3:00:15.920 --> 3:00:18.080
 some kind of light tunnel, like a water slide

3:00:18.080 --> 3:00:21.840
 made of light that's increasingly familiar.

3:00:21.840 --> 3:00:23.400
 That's the wildest part of it.

3:00:23.400 --> 3:00:25.200
 It's like, oh, I know this place.

3:00:25.200 --> 3:00:27.160
 Not like, oh, I've seen this in like,

3:00:27.160 --> 3:00:30.560
 you know, on like bong stickers, but like,

3:00:30.560 --> 3:00:32.320
 oh yeah, this is that place you go to.

3:00:32.320 --> 3:00:34.440
 You just remember, oh, this place.

3:00:34.440 --> 3:00:39.040
 And then it was like I was in some kind of,

3:00:40.840 --> 3:00:42.760
 I don't know how to put it, a chamber,

3:00:42.760 --> 3:00:45.920
 a technological chamber, some kind of supercomputer,

3:00:45.920 --> 3:00:49.440
 some kind of nucleus that was technological.

3:00:49.440 --> 3:00:50.520
 And it was inviting.

3:00:50.520 --> 3:00:53.360
 There was an invitation of like, come in,

3:00:53.360 --> 3:00:56.400
 like come deeper into, come deeper in.

3:00:56.400 --> 3:01:00.160
 And you can talk to whatever it is over there.

3:01:00.160 --> 3:01:02.760
 You don't talk, but there's a communication.

3:01:02.760 --> 3:01:07.760
 And I communicated, but my friends, I don't,

3:01:07.880 --> 3:01:08.800
 I love my friends.

3:01:08.800 --> 3:01:10.400
 I guess I had some sense in that moment

3:01:10.400 --> 3:01:12.960
 that it would mean complete obliteration

3:01:12.960 --> 3:01:15.160
 or who knows what.

3:01:15.160 --> 3:01:18.240
 And the response that it gave back was,

3:01:18.240 --> 3:01:20.600
 you can always go back there.

3:01:20.600 --> 3:01:22.400
 And that's when I opened my eyes, I'm back.

3:01:22.400 --> 3:01:25.480
 Totally, you know, and ever since then,

3:01:25.480 --> 3:01:30.480
 that's caused me to revise my thinking on reincarnation.

3:01:30.760 --> 3:01:33.320
 The idea that you die and you start as a baby

3:01:33.320 --> 3:01:34.880
 and then live your life again.

3:01:34.880 --> 3:01:36.920
 It goes right into what we were talking about.

3:01:36.920 --> 3:01:39.680
 You know, that maybe data, you know,

3:01:39.680 --> 3:01:41.360
 that the shit I saw in Nitro Sox,

3:01:41.360 --> 3:01:43.760
 I don't feel dumb that my epiphanies are all related

3:01:43.760 --> 3:01:46.240
 to drugs, but not all of them are a lot of them.

3:01:46.240 --> 3:01:49.720
 But this notion of like, oh, is it that we're

3:01:52.280 --> 3:01:56.040
 imprinting into the medium of time, space,

3:01:56.040 --> 3:02:01.040
 everything we do, and that that is a permanent imprint,

3:02:01.280 --> 3:02:06.280
 a frame that upon death can be accessed

3:02:06.280 --> 3:02:10.760
 in the same way we can pull up pictures on our phone

3:02:10.760 --> 3:02:15.400
 or computers, and not only accessed, but experienced

3:02:15.400 --> 3:02:20.200
 as though, in other words, you could just jump in.

3:02:20.200 --> 3:02:22.040
 You're still gonna have your memories.

3:02:22.040 --> 3:02:26.280
 It's gonna give you the illusion of having been a kid

3:02:26.280 --> 3:02:28.800
 and gotten to that frame, but no,

3:02:28.800 --> 3:02:33.260
 you just decided to go back there, nostalgia, whatever.

3:02:33.260 --> 3:02:37.360
 And yeah, you can jump around freely in space and time.

3:02:37.360 --> 3:02:40.160
 Yeah, yeah, you can go in and out of time space,

3:02:40.160 --> 3:02:43.840
 but the problem is when you go into time space, it's time.

3:02:43.840 --> 3:02:45.260
 So it's gonna feel sticky.

3:02:45.260 --> 3:02:46.640
 It's gonna feel like you've been here forever

3:02:46.640 --> 3:02:49.040
 because you've dropped back onto the track

3:02:49.040 --> 3:02:50.640
 that Nietzsche's talking about.

3:02:51.640 --> 3:02:54.200
 And I guess one of the qualities of dropping

3:02:54.200 --> 3:02:57.040
 into that frame is that you forget

3:02:57.040 --> 3:03:01.000
 your higher dimensional identity.

3:03:01.000 --> 3:03:05.920
 What happened to the cow with the lantern, was that goodbye?

3:03:07.840 --> 3:03:09.540
 He writes me letters sometimes.

3:03:11.000 --> 3:03:12.280
 Never saw it again.

3:03:12.280 --> 3:03:13.120
 Never?

3:03:13.120 --> 3:03:15.240
 Never saw it again, but I put it in,

3:03:15.240 --> 3:03:17.000
 we put it in the Midnight Gospel.

3:03:18.120 --> 3:03:22.060
 Pendleton was such a genius, and he drew it for me,

3:03:22.060 --> 3:03:24.400
 and then it just ended up as a part of the show.

3:03:24.400 --> 3:03:27.960
 But by the way, I have to admit that as a big fan of yours,

3:03:27.960 --> 3:03:29.840
 I haven't watched the Midnight Gospel

3:03:29.840 --> 3:03:31.720
 because I've been waiting.

3:03:33.200 --> 3:03:36.400
 You do these stupid things, but ever since you talked to,

3:03:36.400 --> 3:03:39.800
 maybe two years ago with Joe about it,

3:03:39.800 --> 3:03:41.920
 I've been waiting to watch it

3:03:41.920 --> 3:03:44.680
 with a special person on mushrooms.

3:03:44.680 --> 3:03:46.280
 That's been in my to do.

3:03:46.280 --> 3:03:48.560
 I don't know, of course you don't have to be on mushrooms

3:03:48.560 --> 3:03:52.480
 to enjoy it, but for some reason I put it into my head

3:03:52.480 --> 3:03:55.040
 that this is something I wanna do with somebody else,

3:03:55.040 --> 3:03:57.040
 like experience it and get wild.

3:03:57.040 --> 3:04:00.920
 Because visually, I mean, I watched a bunch of it,

3:04:00.920 --> 3:04:02.520
 just a little bit here and there,

3:04:02.520 --> 3:04:05.940
 but it's just visually such an interesting experience.

3:04:06.800 --> 3:04:07.640
 Thank you.

3:04:07.640 --> 3:04:09.000
 Combined with everything else, obviously,

3:04:09.000 --> 3:04:12.100
 the ideas, the voices and so on,

3:04:12.100 --> 3:04:16.940
 but just visually it's like a super psychedelic version

3:04:16.940 --> 3:04:19.360
 of Rick and Morty or something like that,

3:04:19.360 --> 3:04:23.080
 like farther out, wilder out there.

3:04:23.080 --> 3:04:26.080
 Yeah, man, that's Pendleton.

3:04:26.080 --> 3:04:29.920
 These people, I mean, I was part of that

3:04:31.800 --> 3:04:35.320
 in the sense that Pendleton gave,

3:04:35.320 --> 3:04:37.080
 one of the reasons he's such a genius

3:04:37.080 --> 3:04:41.240
 and great at making stuff is he really does a good job

3:04:41.240 --> 3:04:46.120
 of just dehierarchizing potential hierarchies

3:04:46.120 --> 3:04:47.520
 that can appear.

3:04:47.520 --> 3:04:51.240
 Someone has to be driving the bus, and that was Pendleton,

3:04:51.240 --> 3:04:54.120
 but he's so inclusive.

3:04:54.120 --> 3:04:57.260
 There's a real punk rock thing that he's doing,

3:04:57.260 --> 3:04:58.900
 which is like, he'll take everything,

3:04:58.900 --> 3:05:01.240
 and it kind of mixes its way into the show.

3:05:01.240 --> 3:05:06.240
 But one of the things in animation,

3:05:07.100 --> 3:05:11.800
 it can get really strict with drawing the characters

3:05:11.800 --> 3:05:16.620
 and trying to create continuity

3:05:16.620 --> 3:05:19.280
 in the way the character looks,

3:05:19.280 --> 3:05:21.840
 and it can get really brute for the animator.

3:05:21.840 --> 3:05:26.400
 Making it brutally precise, like it has to be precise.

3:05:26.400 --> 3:05:28.600
 But he figured out that if you just sort of,

3:05:30.300 --> 3:05:33.320
 it's not like, obviously, Clancy had to look like Clancy

3:05:33.320 --> 3:05:34.160
 through the whole show,

3:05:34.160 --> 3:05:36.560
 but if you allow the various people animating it

3:05:36.560 --> 3:05:39.320
 to sort of have their own spin on it,

3:05:39.320 --> 3:05:42.240
 then suddenly it creates a very psychedelic,

3:05:43.400 --> 3:05:45.080
 the show looks more psychedelic

3:05:45.080 --> 3:05:48.240
 because it looks more organic, and also the amount of time.

3:05:48.240 --> 3:05:53.120
 I had no idea, the amount of time that goes into making

3:05:53.120 --> 3:05:58.120
 digital art look like that is, it's insane.

3:05:58.680 --> 3:06:03.680
 The amount of work in comping that stuff is just crazy.

3:06:03.960 --> 3:06:04.960
 It's crazy.

3:06:04.960 --> 3:06:07.380
 Generally, the amount of time it takes,

3:06:07.380 --> 3:06:09.360
 even just like a painting,

3:06:09.360 --> 3:06:13.280
 when you, I really enjoy watching artists do a time lapse,

3:06:13.280 --> 3:06:17.760
 and you realize how much effort just into a single image

3:06:17.760 --> 3:06:19.300
 goes into it.

3:06:19.300 --> 3:06:21.080
 Hours and hours and hours, sometimes days,

3:06:21.080 --> 3:06:23.160
 sometimes weeks and months,

3:06:23.160 --> 3:06:24.820
 and then you just get to see them work,

3:06:24.820 --> 3:06:28.440
 but they lose themselves in the craftsmanship of it,

3:06:28.440 --> 3:06:30.440
 in the rhythm of it.

3:06:30.440 --> 3:06:32.720
 And like, because they're focused on the,

3:06:32.720 --> 3:06:34.520
 so we were talking about robotics earlier,

3:06:34.520 --> 3:06:37.320
 like on the little details, like they're never look,

3:06:37.320 --> 3:06:40.040
 well, most of the time isn't spent looking

3:06:40.040 --> 3:06:41.760
 at the big picture of the final result,

3:06:41.760 --> 3:06:44.000
 it's looking at the little details there and so on.

3:06:44.000 --> 3:06:46.280
 And they're, but they're nevertheless able

3:06:46.280 --> 3:06:49.360
 to somehow constantly channel the big picture,

3:06:49.360 --> 3:06:50.440
 the final result.

3:06:50.440 --> 3:06:53.840
 My God, yeah, the respect I have for animators,

3:06:53.840 --> 3:06:58.720
 it's like, dear God, it's the craziest thing

3:06:58.720 --> 3:07:01.180
 when you watch it, when you see what it looks like

3:07:01.180 --> 3:07:04.600
 and how much time goes into it and how zen they have to be,

3:07:04.600 --> 3:07:05.440
 because like, no matter what,

3:07:05.440 --> 3:07:07.240
 you're gonna have to cut stuff, man.

3:07:07.240 --> 3:07:10.400
 And when you're cutting like a few seconds of animation,

3:07:10.400 --> 3:07:13.360
 that was someone's like month, maybe, you know?

3:07:13.360 --> 3:07:17.760
 And like, they understand, but still it's like, whoa,

3:07:17.760 --> 3:07:19.060
 it's brutal.

3:07:19.060 --> 3:07:24.060
 And so they have like this zen outlook on it,

3:07:24.520 --> 3:07:26.320
 which is really cool.

3:07:26.320 --> 3:07:28.080
 And they watch podcasts, that's the other cool thing,

3:07:28.080 --> 3:07:30.420
 when you realize like, oh, they're listening to podcasts

3:07:30.420 --> 3:07:34.360
 or like, that's really cool to see that aspect of it too.

3:07:34.360 --> 3:07:36.880
 But yeah, man, I, you know.

3:07:36.880 --> 3:07:38.460
 Yeah, your voice is in the ears

3:07:38.460 --> 3:07:40.560
 of a lot of interesting people, isn't it?

3:07:40.560 --> 3:07:41.400
 Yours too.

3:07:41.400 --> 3:07:42.680
 And I, you know.

3:07:42.680 --> 3:07:43.880
 Hello, interesting person.

3:07:43.880 --> 3:07:46.880
 Hello, CIA, animators.

3:07:46.880 --> 3:07:49.560
 Eating delicious food in the cafeteria.

3:07:49.560 --> 3:07:50.600
 Yeah. I'm on your side.

3:07:50.600 --> 3:07:52.360
 He's against you, I'm with you.

3:07:52.360 --> 3:07:53.600
 Yeah.

3:07:53.600 --> 3:07:56.920
 Do you have, you have a beard, therefore you must be wise.

3:07:56.920 --> 3:08:01.340
 Do you have advice for young people, high school, college,

3:08:02.840 --> 3:08:05.440
 about how to carve their path through life?

3:08:05.440 --> 3:08:10.040
 I don't have a life, a career that's successful

3:08:10.040 --> 3:08:12.840
 that they can be proud of or a life they can be proud of.

3:08:12.840 --> 3:08:14.760
 Man, see, this is what kind of,

3:08:14.760 --> 3:08:18.320
 this is what sucks about my life,

3:08:18.320 --> 3:08:23.320
 is that it's been very random and very spontaneous.

3:08:23.600 --> 3:08:27.080
 So unfortunately, I don't get that thing

3:08:27.080 --> 3:08:28.960
 where I could be like, well, here's what I did.

3:08:28.960 --> 3:08:29.800
 Yeah.

3:08:29.800 --> 3:08:34.200
 Cause it's like, I don't, like I inherited $12,000

3:08:34.200 --> 3:08:36.960
 from my grandmother, here's what you do kids,

3:08:36.960 --> 3:08:39.600
 you inherit $12,000 when your grandmother dies.

3:08:39.600 --> 3:08:41.640
 And then you need to be dumb enough

3:08:41.640 --> 3:08:44.480
 to think that that $12,000 is gonna help you

3:08:44.480 --> 3:08:46.200
 live in LA for a year.

3:08:46.200 --> 3:08:49.760
 So then what you do is you move to LA with $12,000

3:08:49.760 --> 3:08:53.740
 and you find a shitty place that you live at.

3:08:53.740 --> 3:08:58.040
 And then you use that money to buy acid and synthesizers.

3:08:58.040 --> 3:09:00.720
 And then you run out of the money and then you,

3:09:02.280 --> 3:09:03.960
 then you have to get a job.

3:09:03.960 --> 3:09:05.580
 And so then, because you think it'll be fun

3:09:05.580 --> 3:09:09.220
 to work at a comedy club, you get a job at the comedy store.

3:09:09.220 --> 3:09:11.920
 And then, you know, that's how it happened for me.

3:09:11.920 --> 3:09:15.080
 And none of, there wasn't, I never had the confidence

3:09:15.080 --> 3:09:18.520
 to be like, I'm gonna be a standup comedian.

3:09:18.520 --> 3:09:19.360
 No way.

3:09:19.360 --> 3:09:22.080
 I just thought it'd be cool to work in that building.

3:09:22.080 --> 3:09:23.800
 I thought the building looked cool.

3:09:23.800 --> 3:09:26.480
 And so, but then like, cause like you work

3:09:26.480 --> 3:09:28.520
 at the comedy store, you get stage time.

3:09:28.520 --> 3:09:32.240
 It's there, it's the reason like you work there

3:09:32.240 --> 3:09:34.400
 is at least in those days, cause it's not like

3:09:34.400 --> 3:09:36.680
 they're paying like a shit ton of money

3:09:36.680 --> 3:09:39.120
 for you to answer phones at a comedy club.

3:09:39.120 --> 3:09:42.440
 And so, you know, I started going on stage

3:09:42.440 --> 3:09:46.000
 and then like, I just got lucky

3:09:46.000 --> 3:09:50.360
 cause Rogan saw me have like a very rare, good set.

3:09:50.360 --> 3:09:52.560
 I didn't know he was in the room or I would've bombed,

3:09:52.560 --> 3:09:55.120
 you know, and then like, cause he thought I was funny

3:09:55.120 --> 3:09:56.040
 and he liked talking to me.

3:09:56.040 --> 3:09:57.900
 He started taking me on the road with him.

3:09:57.900 --> 3:09:59.640
 And then, you know, so I don't know, man.

3:09:59.640 --> 3:10:00.480
 I think.

3:10:01.560 --> 3:10:04.160
 Was there an element to, there's a beautiful weirdness

3:10:04.160 --> 3:10:06.680
 to you as a human being.

3:10:06.680 --> 3:10:11.680
 Was there like a pressure to conform ever

3:10:12.520 --> 3:10:15.620
 to hide yourself from the world?

3:10:15.620 --> 3:10:19.240
 Or did the $12,000 in the acid give you

3:10:19.240 --> 3:10:21.640
 the confidence you needed to be yourself?

3:10:21.640 --> 3:10:24.440
 Oh no, I don't, like I still, no.

3:10:24.440 --> 3:10:26.760
 I think, sure, there's that pressure.

3:10:26.760 --> 3:10:30.080
 And like, you know, whenever you're beginning

3:10:30.080 --> 3:10:31.840
 to really differentiate from your parents,

3:10:31.840 --> 3:10:34.040
 but then you go back to hang out with your parents,

3:10:34.040 --> 3:10:38.040
 you can feel that it's not like they even want you

3:10:38.040 --> 3:10:40.420
 to conform, but you'll just, you could slip into that,

3:10:40.420 --> 3:10:41.320
 whatever that was.

3:10:41.320 --> 3:10:42.980
 So I remember that when I would go back

3:10:42.980 --> 3:10:45.280
 and like visit them and stuff.

3:10:45.280 --> 3:10:50.280
 And surely conformity or the pressure to like,

3:10:50.440 --> 3:10:53.860
 not be individual or whatever, it's everywhere, man.

3:10:53.860 --> 3:10:55.960
 Do you think you made your parents proud?

3:10:58.600 --> 3:11:03.320
 E, no, no, no, no.

3:11:03.320 --> 3:11:06.860
 Well, I think that when my mom died,

3:11:08.480 --> 3:11:13.080
 I felt successful in the sense that I was able

3:11:13.080 --> 3:11:18.080
 to support my, I was making money from doing standup

3:11:18.720 --> 3:11:20.000
 and I didn't need help.

3:11:20.000 --> 3:11:22.600
 I was like, I was supporting myself with art

3:11:22.600 --> 3:11:24.960
 and doing good, what I thought was great then.

3:11:24.960 --> 3:11:29.400
 So, and I think she, like, because she had witnessed

3:11:29.400 --> 3:11:32.380
 me literally failing, I mean, which is, by the way,

3:11:32.380 --> 3:11:35.960
 I think part of, if you want to be an artist

3:11:35.960 --> 3:11:38.640
 or successful, you kind of have to fail.

3:11:38.640 --> 3:11:43.640
 Like there, if, and if there was a guaranteed route

3:11:44.080 --> 3:11:49.080
 from sucking to not sucking or from like the neophyte phase

3:11:52.520 --> 3:11:55.080
 of whatever the art form is and, you know,

3:11:55.080 --> 3:11:58.120
 some intermediary phase, then I think a lot more people

3:11:58.120 --> 3:12:01.720
 would do it, but there really is no guarantees in it,

3:12:01.720 --> 3:12:03.200
 especially the standup comedy.

3:12:03.200 --> 3:12:06.720
 It's like, you'd have to be a maniac to want to,

3:12:06.720 --> 3:12:08.480
 to think that that's going to work out for you.

3:12:08.480 --> 3:12:10.560
 You have to, so you're going to,

3:12:11.960 --> 3:12:15.360
 there are obviously exceptions, but for me,

3:12:15.360 --> 3:12:18.920
 it was like a long slog, you know,

3:12:18.920 --> 3:12:20.400
 and that's scary for a mom.

3:12:20.400 --> 3:12:25.400
 So, but that being said, when she was dying,

3:12:26.160 --> 3:12:31.120
 like she did recognize that I was like not slogging anymore.

3:12:31.120 --> 3:12:35.000
 And she did say, she said, you did it.

3:12:35.000 --> 3:12:38.480
 And that's cool, but in, you know,

3:12:38.480 --> 3:12:40.040
 I would love for her to see me now,

3:12:40.040 --> 3:12:42.820
 like now it'd be way cooler, but maybe she does.

3:12:42.820 --> 3:12:43.660
 I don't know.

3:12:43.660 --> 3:12:47.240
 She's listening to your podcast elsewhere in the other,

3:12:47.240 --> 3:12:48.440
 in the Bardo.

3:12:48.440 --> 3:12:53.240
 Yeah, however long that lasts reconfiguring

3:12:53.240 --> 3:12:55.000
 the whole process to start again.

3:12:56.320 --> 3:12:59.600
 You as a father now, how did that change you?

3:12:59.600 --> 3:13:02.160
 Yeah, that's the big change, man.

3:13:02.160 --> 3:13:03.000
 That's the thing.

3:13:03.000 --> 3:13:06.780
 You made a few biological entities.

3:13:06.780 --> 3:13:08.640
 Yeah, I made biological entities.

3:13:08.640 --> 3:13:10.920
 I mean, I came in my wife, let's face it.

3:13:10.920 --> 3:13:12.360
 Like I would love to say I made them,

3:13:12.360 --> 3:13:17.360
 but the womb whipped them up, but it is the,

3:13:17.900 --> 3:13:18.880
 yeah, it's the best.

3:13:18.880 --> 3:13:22.480
 It's, I've never experienced anything like it before.

3:13:22.480 --> 3:13:24.920
 It is the, as far as I'm concerned,

3:13:24.920 --> 3:13:27.800
 the greatest thing that has ever happened to me.

3:13:27.800 --> 3:13:30.520
 And that's why I was able to answer your Nietzsche question

3:13:30.520 --> 3:13:33.000
 with like, hell yes, fuck yes.

3:13:33.000 --> 3:13:33.840
 That's great.

3:13:33.840 --> 3:13:35.200
 I get to be around my kids again.

3:13:35.200 --> 3:13:36.360
 I'll always be around my kids.

3:13:36.360 --> 3:13:38.300
 I'll always be around my children.

3:13:38.300 --> 3:13:39.140
 That's incredible.

3:13:39.140 --> 3:13:39.980
 That's the joy.

3:13:39.980 --> 3:13:41.880
 So like, so for me,

3:13:45.240 --> 3:13:48.320
 the part of myself that used to torture myself more,

3:13:48.320 --> 3:13:51.040
 especially like around like my mom dying,

3:13:51.040 --> 3:13:53.680
 feeling like I wasn't there enough for her,

3:13:53.680 --> 3:13:56.060
 wishing that I had spent more time with her,

3:13:56.060 --> 3:13:58.200
 wishing I'd spent more time with my dad,

3:13:58.200 --> 3:14:01.760
 wishing that like, looking back at like how like

3:14:01.760 --> 3:14:05.400
 I was just so desperately trying to evade the fact

3:14:05.400 --> 3:14:09.040
 that she was dying and through,

3:14:09.040 --> 3:14:13.200
 and in that evasion successfully like distanced myself

3:14:13.200 --> 3:14:16.380
 from her and like in ways that I really wish I hadn't.

3:14:20.040 --> 3:14:22.200
 I'm just saying that because it's one of my regrets.

3:14:22.200 --> 3:14:23.160
 It's like a big regret.

3:14:23.160 --> 3:14:24.520
 I have a lot of little regrets,

3:14:24.520 --> 3:14:26.280
 but that's a big one.

3:14:26.280 --> 3:14:30.880
 And so when you have kids,

3:14:33.140 --> 3:14:38.140
 you look back at everything you did

3:14:38.240 --> 3:14:40.320
 and you think like, fuck,

3:14:40.320 --> 3:14:43.580
 if I'd gone left at that point instead of right,

3:14:43.580 --> 3:14:45.680
 if I had eaten, who knows?

3:14:45.680 --> 3:14:48.780
 What if I'd eaten like a turkey sandwich

3:14:48.780 --> 3:14:53.380
 when my balls were creating the cum

3:14:53.380 --> 3:14:54.880
 that was gonna make my kids?

3:14:54.880 --> 3:14:56.580
 Would I have a different kid?

3:14:56.580 --> 3:14:59.000
 Would this being not exist in my life?

3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:00.440
 Like you start looking at everything

3:15:00.440 --> 3:15:03.540
 and you realize like, thank God,

3:15:03.540 --> 3:15:06.400
 thank God for every single thing that happened to me

3:15:06.400 --> 3:15:08.760
 because it all led up to this.

3:15:08.760 --> 3:15:12.880
 And oh, for me, that is the, that's,

3:15:12.880 --> 3:15:17.880
 that it's like, it frees you in this.

3:15:18.240 --> 3:15:21.140
 It liberates you because you realize like,

3:15:21.140 --> 3:15:23.720
 oh wow, it's clumsy and selfish

3:15:23.720 --> 3:15:28.720
 and at times rotten as I've been in my life.

3:15:29.400 --> 3:15:34.240
 That did not impede the universe at all

3:15:34.240 --> 3:15:37.340
 from allowing these two beautiful beings

3:15:37.340 --> 3:15:38.440
 to exist in the world.

3:15:38.440 --> 3:15:40.360
 So maybe all of it enabled,

3:15:40.360 --> 3:15:44.600
 all of it like a concert perfectly led up

3:15:44.600 --> 3:15:47.560
 to that little beautiful moment.

3:15:47.560 --> 3:15:52.560
 Is there ways you would like to be a better father?

3:15:52.640 --> 3:15:54.360
 Oh yeah, for sure.

3:15:54.360 --> 3:15:55.640
 Absolutely.

3:15:55.640 --> 3:15:59.420
 There's a actual, I read something in a book,

3:15:59.420 --> 3:16:00.960
 it's called Good Enough.

3:16:00.960 --> 3:16:03.400
 The mantra for a parent, good enough.

3:16:03.400 --> 3:16:05.000
 Because when you are in the presence

3:16:05.000 --> 3:16:07.680
 of something you love more

3:16:07.680 --> 3:16:10.660
 than you've ever experienced love,

3:16:12.800 --> 3:16:15.520
 you wanna be perfect.

3:16:15.520 --> 3:16:17.680
 Like you wanna be, I can't, I gotta work, man.

3:16:17.680 --> 3:16:18.920
 I gotta go on the road.

3:16:18.920 --> 3:16:19.760
 I've gotta work.

3:16:19.760 --> 3:16:20.760
 I gotta support the family.

3:16:20.760 --> 3:16:22.240
 So that means I have to work.

3:16:22.240 --> 3:16:25.480
 Like I work, you know what it's like having a podcast.

3:16:25.480 --> 3:16:26.800
 You fucking work, man.

3:16:26.800 --> 3:16:31.440
 And you know, it's a full time job

3:16:31.440 --> 3:16:33.860
 because I've, you know, I do standup too

3:16:33.860 --> 3:16:34.720
 and all the other stuff.

3:16:34.720 --> 3:16:38.720
 So I feel sometimes I feel like, oh my God,

3:16:38.720 --> 3:16:40.660
 I wanna spend more time with them.

3:16:40.660 --> 3:16:42.120
 Like I should be spending more time with them.

3:16:42.120 --> 3:16:45.040
 But then also I wanna create, I wanna work.

3:16:45.040 --> 3:16:49.000
 I like being like the provider.

3:16:49.000 --> 3:16:53.600
 So that's something I feel guilty about, you know, right now.

3:16:53.600 --> 3:16:56.600
 And you're struggling how to balance that correctly.

3:16:56.600 --> 3:16:59.880
 And meanwhile, time just marches on.

3:16:59.880 --> 3:17:03.280
 It just goes, it goes.

3:17:03.280 --> 3:17:07.440
 And all of this will be forgotten.

3:17:07.440 --> 3:17:11.600
 Both you and I, but forgotten in time.

3:17:11.600 --> 3:17:12.420
 That's what I say to them

3:17:12.420 --> 3:17:15.600
 every time I'm putting them to bed.

3:17:15.600 --> 3:17:18.560
 We will be lost in the sands of time.

3:17:18.560 --> 3:17:20.440
 You know that, I bet you know this poem.

3:17:20.440 --> 3:17:22.440
 You know that poem, Ozymandias?

3:17:22.440 --> 3:17:23.920
 Yes.

3:17:23.920 --> 3:17:25.720
 Can I read you a poem?

3:17:25.720 --> 3:17:26.980
 Oh, okay.

3:17:29.580 --> 3:17:32.280
 Let's end our conversation in a poem.

3:17:32.280 --> 3:17:33.220
 I love it.

3:17:33.220 --> 3:17:37.480
 It's by Pierce, by Shelley,

3:17:37.480 --> 3:17:39.520
 probably mispronouncing the name.

3:17:39.520 --> 3:17:40.360
 But I think you'll get it.

3:17:40.360 --> 3:17:41.200
 There's no right way to pronounce anything.

3:17:41.200 --> 3:17:42.320
 Thank you, thank you.

3:17:44.200 --> 3:17:45.820
 I'm Ozymandias.

3:17:45.820 --> 3:17:49.200
 I met a traveler from an antique land who said,

3:17:49.200 --> 3:17:54.120
 "'Two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand in the desert.

3:17:54.120 --> 3:17:57.440
 Near them, on the sand, half sunk,

3:17:57.440 --> 3:18:01.920
 a shattered visage lies whose frown and wrinkled lip

3:18:01.920 --> 3:18:05.760
 and sneer of cold command tell that its sculptor,

3:18:05.760 --> 3:18:09.360
 well those passions read, which yet survive,

3:18:09.360 --> 3:18:11.880
 stamped on these lifeless things,

3:18:11.880 --> 3:18:15.120
 the hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.

3:18:15.120 --> 3:18:18.300
 And on the pedestal, these words appear.

3:18:18.300 --> 3:18:21.960
 My name is Ozymandias, king of kings.

3:18:21.960 --> 3:18:25.320
 Look on my works, ye mighty, in despair.

3:18:25.320 --> 3:18:27.760
 Nothing beside remains around the decay

3:18:27.760 --> 3:18:31.080
 of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,

3:18:31.080 --> 3:18:34.560
 the lone and level sands stretch far away."

3:18:34.560 --> 3:18:39.560
 All gone, behold the king.

3:18:42.080 --> 3:18:45.680
 Look on my works, ye mighty, in despair.

3:18:45.680 --> 3:18:47.440
 In despair.

3:18:47.440 --> 3:18:50.680
 Even though it will be forgotten in the sands of time,

3:18:50.680 --> 3:18:53.600
 Duncan, I'm just so glad that you exist

3:18:53.600 --> 3:18:55.560
 and you put so much love into the world

3:18:55.560 --> 3:18:57.560
 over the past many years that I've gotten a chance

3:18:57.560 --> 3:18:59.440
 to enjoy it by being your fan.

3:18:59.440 --> 3:19:00.360
 Likewise.

3:19:00.360 --> 3:19:02.800
 Thank you so much for continuing that

3:19:02.800 --> 3:19:04.720
 and for sharing a bit of love with me today.

3:19:04.720 --> 3:19:05.880
 Can we be friends?

3:19:05.880 --> 3:19:06.720
 Let's be friends.

3:19:06.720 --> 3:19:09.320
 In the real world, in 3D space?

3:19:09.320 --> 3:19:12.080
 Nothing is real, but yes, in this particular slice

3:19:12.080 --> 3:19:14.560
 of the multidimensional world we live in.

3:19:14.560 --> 3:19:16.160
 It will be an honor and a pleasure.

3:19:16.160 --> 3:19:17.480
 Thank you for having me on your show.

3:19:17.480 --> 3:19:18.300
 I love you, Duncan.

3:19:18.300 --> 3:19:19.140
 I love you.

3:19:19.140 --> 3:19:20.560
 Thank you, Lex.

3:19:20.560 --> 3:19:22.080
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

3:19:22.080 --> 3:19:23.320
 with Duncan Trussell.

3:19:29.520 --> 3:19:31.240
 from Duncan Trussell himself.

3:19:31.240 --> 3:19:35.640
 You are essentially just a cloud of atoms

3:19:35.640 --> 3:19:39.120
 that will eventually be aerosolized by time.

3:19:39.120 --> 3:20:04.120
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
