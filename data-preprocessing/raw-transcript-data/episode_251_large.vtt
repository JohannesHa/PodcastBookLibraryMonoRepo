00:00.000 --> 00:02.600
 The following is a conversation with Ray Dalio,

00:02.600 --> 00:04.520
 his second time on the podcast.

00:04.520 --> 00:06.920
 He is a legendary investor,

00:06.920 --> 00:09.120
 founder of Bridgewater Associates,

00:09.120 --> 00:12.440
 author of a book I highly recommend called Principles,

00:12.440 --> 00:16.000
 and also a new book called Principles for Dealing

00:16.000 --> 00:17.840
 with a Changing World Order,

00:17.840 --> 00:20.480
 that looks at the geopolitics of today,

00:20.480 --> 00:24.580
 especially US and China, through the lens of history,

00:24.580 --> 00:26.120
 providing a fascinating model

00:26.120 --> 00:28.200
 for the rise and fall of empires

00:28.200 --> 00:31.300
 that can be applied to the analysis of our world today.

00:32.160 --> 00:34.300
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:34.300 --> 00:36.360
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:36.360 --> 00:37.520
 in the description.

00:37.520 --> 00:42.040
 And now, here's my conversation with Ray Dalio.

00:42.040 --> 00:44.200
 When you look at the history of the world,

00:44.200 --> 00:45.880
 as you have done in your new book,

00:45.880 --> 00:49.760
 Principles of Dealing with a Changing World Order,

00:49.760 --> 00:53.280
 what is more important, more impactful, money or power?

00:54.360 --> 00:56.480
 They go hand in hand.

00:56.480 --> 01:01.120
 They support each other and they compete with each other.

01:01.120 --> 01:05.380
 Those who have money have power, a certain type of power.

01:06.380 --> 01:09.600
 That power has to do with all that they can buy,

01:09.600 --> 01:12.560
 but it also has the ability

01:12.560 --> 01:15.400
 to influence those with political power.

01:17.920 --> 01:20.260
 And so you see this throughout history,

01:20.260 --> 01:22.640
 this symbiotic relationship.

01:22.640 --> 01:27.640
 You know, for example, between the royal families,

01:29.680 --> 01:33.400
 the nobility, and the church.

01:33.400 --> 01:36.160
 So you see that group of people

01:36.160 --> 01:39.080
 supporting each other in various ways,

01:39.080 --> 01:42.480
 and then wrestling around with each other

01:42.480 --> 01:45.880
 for the money and power among that group.

01:45.880 --> 01:48.640
 So the dynamic that's quite classic

01:48.640 --> 01:52.860
 is you could look at the parties in power

01:52.860 --> 01:57.800
 back in the 16th, 17th centuries.

01:57.800 --> 02:01.680
 You would look at royal families, nobles,

02:01.680 --> 02:05.600
 and the church, if you're in Europe,

02:05.600 --> 02:10.080
 and then you would look at agricultural land,

02:10.080 --> 02:12.280
 and there was a certain dynamic.

02:12.280 --> 02:15.140
 And that varies over time, it changes,

02:15.140 --> 02:20.140
 as those people get thrown out and technology changes.

02:20.460 --> 02:24.100
 So when we evolved, when the society evolved,

02:24.100 --> 02:28.020
 so that it would produce goods and services,

02:28.020 --> 02:31.920
 and you have something like the Industrial Revolution,

02:31.920 --> 02:35.140
 the first Industrial Revolution, you have machines,

02:35.140 --> 02:38.980
 and you have the talent of people that are off the farms,

02:40.020 --> 02:43.400
 and then you have a struggling for power.

02:43.400 --> 02:47.500
 You see that power mix change.

02:47.500 --> 02:50.860
 And so we don't see that same power mix anymore,

02:50.860 --> 02:53.900
 but you still see the same dynamic.

02:53.900 --> 02:55.680
 You see those with money,

02:56.700 --> 03:00.560
 dealing with those who have political power

03:00.560 --> 03:04.660
 around those assets that are considered most valuable

03:04.660 --> 03:09.320
 to particularly the productive assets that produce money.

03:09.320 --> 03:14.060
 And political power is usually centered around nation state,

03:14.060 --> 03:17.860
 so the major locus of power is the nations.

03:17.860 --> 03:22.860
 Yes, in 1668, after 30 years of war,

03:25.140 --> 03:29.900
 there was the development of nation states.

03:29.900 --> 03:34.620
 Before then, it was really the development of countries

03:34.620 --> 03:37.500
 as we know it, that there were borders,

03:37.500 --> 03:40.440
 and that within those borders,

03:40.440 --> 03:43.940
 those who had control got to control it,

03:43.940 --> 03:48.100
 and there were not to be intrusions in those borders,

03:48.100 --> 03:51.540
 and that's how we established the nation state.

03:51.540 --> 03:56.440
 And then, of course, within each country, there is levels.

03:56.440 --> 03:59.660
 There is a central level,

03:59.660 --> 04:02.700
 and then there is typically a province

04:02.700 --> 04:05.360
 or state level down below,

04:05.360 --> 04:06.980
 and then there's a municipal level,

04:06.980 --> 04:10.700
 so they each have different levels of power,

04:10.700 --> 04:14.460
 and it's the coordination of those

04:14.460 --> 04:17.940
 that determines how the country is run.

04:19.260 --> 04:23.340
 You write that the, quote, archetypal big cycle

04:23.340 --> 04:25.880
 governs the rising and declining empires

04:25.880 --> 04:27.900
 and influences everything about them,

04:27.900 --> 04:30.380
 including their currencies and markets.

04:30.380 --> 04:31.800
 The most important three cycles

04:31.800 --> 04:35.100
 are the ones you mention in the introduction,

04:35.100 --> 04:38.220
 the long term debt and capital market cycle,

04:38.220 --> 04:40.540
 the internal order and disorder cycle,

04:40.540 --> 04:44.660
 and the external order and disorder cycle.

04:44.660 --> 04:47.440
 Can you describe this big cycle?

04:48.380 --> 04:49.680
 There are two orders.

04:50.660 --> 04:55.340
 There is an order, by order I mean a system,

04:55.340 --> 04:56.900
 how the system works.

04:58.180 --> 05:01.620
 So there's an internal order,

05:01.620 --> 05:04.120
 that is the internal governance system,

05:04.120 --> 05:06.740
 and it's usually set out in a constitution

05:06.740 --> 05:11.420
 or some agreements, and then there's the world order,

05:11.420 --> 05:12.720
 how the world system.

05:12.720 --> 05:17.720
 So for example, in 1945, at the end of a war,

05:18.420 --> 05:22.300
 which is basically a fight for determining the world order,

05:23.340 --> 05:27.620
 the winners of the fight got together

05:27.620 --> 05:32.460
 and created the world system as we now know it.

05:32.460 --> 05:35.940
 In 1944, they created the Bretton Woods Monetary System

05:35.940 --> 05:38.620
 that determined the money, pretty much,

05:38.620 --> 05:41.440
 and because the United States won

05:41.440 --> 05:44.140
 and had 80% of the world's money,

05:44.140 --> 05:47.180
 gold was money then, and it had 80% of the world's gold,

05:47.180 --> 05:48.780
 and it was half the world's economy,

05:48.780 --> 05:51.500
 and it was the great military power,

05:51.500 --> 05:55.280
 the order was built around an American world order,

05:55.280 --> 05:58.460
 so that the United Nations was in New York,

05:58.460 --> 06:00.940
 the World Bank and the IMF were in Washington,

06:00.940 --> 06:02.740
 and they built that new order.

06:02.740 --> 06:05.580
 So classically, you have a war

06:05.580 --> 06:08.660
 to determine whose rules we're following,

06:08.660 --> 06:13.380
 and then you have the new order being constructed.

06:13.380 --> 06:16.220
 After that, there is usually period

06:16.220 --> 06:20.760
 of extended peace and prosperity.

06:20.760 --> 06:25.420
 Peace suits prosperity, and so there's not,

06:25.420 --> 06:27.020
 and the reason you have the peace

06:27.020 --> 06:31.820
 is because no one wants to fight with the dominant power.

06:31.820 --> 06:34.100
 You know you're gonna lose, you've surrendered.

06:34.100 --> 06:35.340
 There's been the surrendering.

06:35.340 --> 06:36.580
 They carve up the world,

06:36.580 --> 06:38.460
 they say what it's gonna look like,

06:38.460 --> 06:40.140
 who's gonna control what,

06:40.140 --> 06:44.700
 and then you come into that period of peace,

06:44.700 --> 06:49.700
 and then prosperity, where then there's a working together.

06:50.820 --> 06:55.820
 Usually, at that point, you've wiped out a lot of the debt,

06:55.820 --> 06:59.600
 you've wiped out a lot of the issues,

06:59.600 --> 07:01.960
 the class warfare and so on,

07:01.960 --> 07:03.720
 and then there's good working together.

07:03.720 --> 07:06.560
 So those great periods,

07:06.560 --> 07:11.560
 such as the Industrial Revolution in the late 1800s,

07:12.560 --> 07:15.920
 or what we've experienced in the post World War II period,

07:15.920 --> 07:19.240
 are peaceful and prosperous periods

07:19.240 --> 07:22.520
 led largely by the dominant world power.

07:22.520 --> 07:27.520
 Over a period of time, since really 1500,

07:28.200 --> 07:31.800
 and maybe before, but really 1500,

07:31.800 --> 07:35.840
 when the Dutch invented capitalism,

07:35.840 --> 07:37.040
 and what I mean by that,

07:37.040 --> 07:39.640
 they invented the first capital markets,

07:39.640 --> 07:42.580
 the first stocks and the first stock market,

07:43.580 --> 07:47.440
 that since then, capitalism has been an effective tool

07:47.440 --> 07:50.800
 for building wealth because it got resources

07:50.800 --> 07:54.000
 into the hands of inventive people.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.540
 That's when we moved from agriculture

07:56.540 --> 07:58.840
 to the importance of inventiveness of people,

07:58.840 --> 08:03.500
 they got resources, and then they built that prosperity.

08:03.500 --> 08:06.020
 In that process of doing that,

08:06.020 --> 08:09.060
 they create wealth gaps, naturally.

08:09.060 --> 08:13.200
 Those who make a lot of money make a lot more

08:13.200 --> 08:15.020
 than those that don't,

08:16.000 --> 08:20.200
 and it also produces opportunity gaps

08:20.200 --> 08:22.920
 because, for example,

08:22.920 --> 08:26.480
 those who earn a lot of money have that wealth,

08:26.480 --> 08:29.320
 they have the power to educate their children

08:29.320 --> 08:34.320
 in a way that others don't, and the gaps grow.

08:34.860 --> 08:38.520
 And also, the debts grow at that time.

08:38.520 --> 08:43.520
 When they go around the world with their competitiveness,

08:43.840 --> 08:46.040
 they earn a lot of money.

08:46.040 --> 08:49.020
 So for example, the Dutch, the Dutch Empire,

08:49.020 --> 08:54.020
 learned how to build ships that would go around the world.

08:54.200 --> 08:58.000
 A key ingredient of this improvement in this cycle

08:58.000 --> 09:00.560
 is the improvement of education,

09:00.560 --> 09:04.280
 and by education I mean the skills that come from education,

09:04.280 --> 09:08.680
 but also civility, the ability to deal well together.

09:08.680 --> 09:12.380
 So the Dutch invented ships that could go around the world

09:12.380 --> 09:13.720
 and they had military power,

09:13.720 --> 09:16.400
 but they were also a very inventive society.

09:16.400 --> 09:21.280
 25% of the world's new inventions came from the Dutch,

09:21.280 --> 09:23.720
 and so as they went around the world,

09:23.720 --> 09:26.200
 they also brought their currency,

09:26.200 --> 09:28.220
 and they brought their military.

09:28.220 --> 09:31.640
 They needed the currency, they paid for things,

09:31.640 --> 09:34.620
 and that currency, and then the more that happens,

09:34.620 --> 09:37.960
 the more that becomes a reserve currency,

09:37.960 --> 09:40.140
 and then they have their military,

09:40.140 --> 09:42.000
 so they need their military strength,

09:42.000 --> 09:45.920
 and so you see it evolve in all of those ways.

09:45.920 --> 09:48.000
 But over a period of time,

09:48.880 --> 09:53.000
 as they become more successful and more expensive,

09:53.000 --> 09:55.200
 they become more expensive,

09:57.240 --> 09:59.900
 and newer countries come along,

09:59.900 --> 10:04.900
 like the UK, then learn to build ships from a lot the Dutch

10:07.760 --> 10:10.440
 and could do that less expensively,

10:10.440 --> 10:14.400
 and also when they become more expensive,

10:14.400 --> 10:16.120
 so less competitive,

10:16.120 --> 10:19.080
 and also the work ethic begins to change.

10:19.080 --> 10:20.680
 They believe that since they're richer,

10:20.680 --> 10:22.640
 they can enjoy life more.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.260
 They don't have to work quite as hard,

10:25.260 --> 10:28.040
 and so you start to see the tilt.

10:28.040 --> 10:31.160
 Now you start to see the development of the top,

10:31.160 --> 10:34.360
 and when you have a world reserve currency,

10:34.360 --> 10:37.000
 that allows you to borrow a lot of money

10:37.000 --> 10:41.920
 because those who want to save want to hold your money,

10:41.920 --> 10:44.080
 and that means that they'll lend you money,

10:44.080 --> 10:47.120
 and so those countries get deeper into debt.

10:47.120 --> 10:51.360
 So you see that they gradually lose their competitiveness,

10:51.360 --> 10:56.280
 and they get themselves into financial circumstances,

10:56.280 --> 10:58.700
 which are not good,

10:58.700 --> 11:01.460
 and they have large wealth gaps,

11:01.460 --> 11:04.640
 which set the stage for downturns.

11:04.640 --> 11:06.680
 And when they have downturns,

11:07.560 --> 11:10.120
 the first question is do they have enough money?

11:10.120 --> 11:15.120
 And traditionally, money is resources.

11:15.640 --> 11:20.000
 So you classically see that the coffers are bare,

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
 that they're spending more money than they are earning,

11:25.240 --> 11:28.920
 and they run out of money in the coffers,

11:28.920 --> 11:33.180
 and their granaries are empty rather than stocked

11:33.180 --> 11:35.360
 so that they give them the buffer.

11:35.360 --> 11:40.360
 And as that deteriorates, that worsens conditions.

11:40.360 --> 11:44.480
 And if they have a rival power that's also challenging them,

11:44.480 --> 11:48.840
 they see greater internal conflict over wealth,

11:48.840 --> 11:52.440
 and then they have the problems internally

11:52.440 --> 11:54.120
 and the problems externally,

11:54.120 --> 11:59.120
 which usually results in an internal war or an external war

11:59.480 --> 12:03.000
 that leads to the change to the new world order.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.740
 And to you, the Dutch Empire is a good example of that.

12:07.740 --> 12:11.140
 The British, what are some of the key examples

12:11.140 --> 12:13.140
 that you think about in the book

12:13.140 --> 12:16.280
 of this process that followed the big cycle?

12:16.280 --> 12:19.160
 Well, the leading reserve currency empires,

12:19.160 --> 12:21.420
 but it applies to all the empires,

12:22.980 --> 12:27.780
 were the Dutch, the British, the American, and the Chinese.

12:28.780 --> 12:32.620
 But you could follow the same pattern.

12:32.620 --> 12:35.420
 In the book, it was very important for me

12:35.420 --> 12:39.000
 to not just use words and concepts

12:39.000 --> 12:41.380
 because that's subjective.

12:41.380 --> 12:45.780
 It was very important for me to use actual measurements.

12:45.780 --> 12:49.460
 So as you see in the book, you can see every level of this.

12:49.460 --> 12:52.060
 You can see where's the education level,

12:52.060 --> 12:55.540
 what is the military power, each one of those,

12:55.540 --> 12:59.300
 and you could see them back going over the 500 years.

12:59.300 --> 13:03.380
 And so you could see the arcs and the composition

13:03.380 --> 13:07.260
 of those arcs, and what you see is really,

13:07.260 --> 13:10.780
 in most countries and most dynasties, you could see that.

13:10.780 --> 13:13.540
 But you also can see through those numbers

13:13.540 --> 13:15.980
 the health of those countries.

13:15.980 --> 13:20.980
 Today, there are statistics that are in the book

13:21.820 --> 13:25.140
 that show what is the level of education,

13:25.140 --> 13:28.260
 what is the level of economic output,

13:28.260 --> 13:32.140
 what is the level of military strength,

13:32.140 --> 13:34.700
 what is the level of a number of different measures

13:34.700 --> 13:38.020
 of strength, so that you can then compare that.

13:38.020 --> 13:40.580
 And I think that because they're objective measures

13:40.580 --> 13:43.320
 of strength that you could see change,

13:44.380 --> 13:48.140
 that shows the picture of where we are today.

13:48.140 --> 13:51.640
 And I think one of the most important things about the book

13:51.640 --> 13:54.380
 is that it allows people to monitor

13:54.380 --> 13:56.680
 how those things are transpiring.

13:56.680 --> 13:58.760
 I think for policymakers,

14:00.700 --> 14:03.180
 are your policymakers doing a good job?

14:03.180 --> 14:06.340
 And there's so much subjectivity in that.

14:06.340 --> 14:08.340
 But I think it's very simple.

14:08.340 --> 14:10.900
 If those lines on the chart are improving,

14:10.900 --> 14:13.340
 if your health index is improving,

14:13.340 --> 14:17.660
 then you're moving toward a better life.

14:17.660 --> 14:19.340
 So that's what the book works like.

14:19.340 --> 14:24.100
 Also, it was used to create a model for the future.

14:24.100 --> 14:28.180
 In other words, there are cause effect relationships.

14:28.180 --> 14:32.060
 Everything that happens has reasons, causes,

14:32.060 --> 14:34.860
 that preceded it, that made it happen.

14:34.860 --> 14:38.020
 And so by having all those in numbers,

14:38.020 --> 14:42.420
 one can see the probabilities of certain things happening.

14:42.420 --> 14:46.780
 So that's what you see in the book.

14:46.780 --> 14:49.940
 It's not just Ray's interpretation.

14:49.940 --> 14:51.900
 I didn't wanna make it Ray's interpretation

14:51.900 --> 14:53.860
 because I don't know if I'm right.

14:53.860 --> 14:56.220
 Yeah, so one of the fascinating things in the book,

14:56.220 --> 14:58.820
 so you have list these 18 measures,

14:58.820 --> 15:01.460
 and there's like a little scorecard

15:01.460 --> 15:04.360
 for the countries of the world today.

15:04.360 --> 15:07.760
 So let's say US, China, and Europe,

15:07.760 --> 15:09.980
 and what it was 20 years ago,

15:09.980 --> 15:11.980
 and looking at the change from 20 years ago,

15:11.980 --> 15:14.480
 and that's another indicator, the change itself,

15:14.480 --> 15:17.260
 to see where things are headed.

15:17.260 --> 15:21.540
 Maybe can you comment on, from a score perspective,

15:21.540 --> 15:24.100
 how is US and China doing?

15:24.100 --> 15:26.700
 And in the 18 measures, what are some measures

15:26.700 --> 15:29.460
 that stand out to you as particularly important

15:29.460 --> 15:32.500
 to think about today for the United States, for China?

15:33.400 --> 15:34.700
 Well, there are a number.

15:35.740 --> 15:40.740
 Financially, what you see in the United States

15:41.060 --> 15:44.800
 is that we're borrowing a lot more money,

15:44.800 --> 15:49.800
 creating a lot of debt, and we're printing a lot of money.

15:49.800 --> 15:54.400
 And our capacity to do that is very much,

15:54.400 --> 15:55.760
 is limited, first of all,

15:55.760 --> 15:59.820
 because when there's a sale of a bond,

15:59.820 --> 16:04.440
 when the government borrows more than it borrows money,

16:04.440 --> 16:07.360
 because it spends more than it takes in,

16:08.320 --> 16:10.300
 you have to sell a bond.

16:10.300 --> 16:11.760
 And the world right now

16:11.760 --> 16:14.800
 has a lot of US dollar denominated bonds,

16:14.800 --> 16:17.220
 because as the world's reserve currency,

16:17.220 --> 16:18.920
 they sell, sold on them.

16:18.920 --> 16:23.920
 And they have very bad returns, negative real returns,

16:24.400 --> 16:27.720
 negative real returns significantly, and so on.

16:27.720 --> 16:31.600
 So that means that more bonds

16:31.600 --> 16:36.660
 has to be sold than are bought.

16:36.660 --> 16:39.560
 And that means that the Federal Reserve

16:40.600 --> 16:43.640
 is faced with the choice of having to raise

16:43.640 --> 16:47.100
 the interest rate to curtail borrowing,

16:47.100 --> 16:49.960
 which slows the economy and hurts the markets,

16:49.960 --> 16:54.960
 or by filling that difference and producing money,

16:55.040 --> 16:59.720
 the debt monetization, which produces an inflation

16:59.720 --> 17:03.440
 in goods, services, and financial assets.

17:03.440 --> 17:08.440
 So in that regard, that's the United States's position.

17:08.880 --> 17:13.880
 In China's case, its balance of payments is better.

17:13.880 --> 17:17.580
 China has displaced the United States

17:17.580 --> 17:20.900
 as the world's largest trading country.

17:20.900 --> 17:23.580
 In other words, more exports to other countries.

17:23.580 --> 17:28.580
 And as a result, it's economically competitive,

17:28.860 --> 17:31.540
 but it doesn't have the world's reserve currency.

17:31.540 --> 17:32.980
 It's a real blessing.

17:32.980 --> 17:36.780
 So the United States, it has the world's reserve currency,

17:36.780 --> 17:40.300
 but it is risking it because of this imbalance.

17:40.300 --> 17:42.300
 So if you look at history,

17:42.300 --> 17:45.380
 you see that those go slowly,

17:45.380 --> 17:49.020
 but when they go eventually, they go quickly.

17:50.140 --> 17:54.820
 So there's a risk of that financially.

17:54.820 --> 17:58.500
 Then there's the issue of internal order.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.260
 So I'm just giving you the major ones,

18:00.260 --> 18:02.720
 but I'll get into some of the other ones too.

18:02.720 --> 18:06.920
 Right now, there's a lot of internal conflict

18:06.920 --> 18:09.900
 in the United States, which affects

18:09.900 --> 18:13.340
 how well it works.

18:14.240 --> 18:17.660
 In China, there's less internal conflict

18:17.660 --> 18:20.740
 because it's a more autocratic state,

18:20.740 --> 18:24.420
 but also they've created this bifurcation

18:24.420 --> 18:29.420
 of what is political and what is economic

18:29.700 --> 18:32.040
 in terms of producing that prosperity.

18:32.040 --> 18:34.700
 So if you stay out of the politics pretty much,

18:35.940 --> 18:39.640
 and then you're seeing entrepreneurship,

18:39.640 --> 18:44.340
 you're seeing the finances of new businesses and so on.

18:44.340 --> 18:46.840
 And so that internal working,

18:48.020 --> 18:51.300
 that's subject to different people's interpretations

18:51.300 --> 18:52.540
 whether they like it or not,

18:52.540 --> 18:55.660
 but the internal conflict in terms of those kinds

18:55.660 --> 18:57.940
 of measures is less.

18:57.940 --> 19:00.160
 Sorry to pause on that for a second.

19:00.160 --> 19:02.780
 So these measures, I guess you don't want

19:02.780 --> 19:06.820
 to sort of romanticize any one measure

19:06.820 --> 19:09.980
 or something like that, overinterpret any one measure,

19:09.980 --> 19:13.940
 but is internal conflict always a bad thing?

19:13.940 --> 19:18.280
 Is it a complicated calculation?

19:18.280 --> 19:19.740
 Or do you kind of, the way we think

19:19.740 --> 19:21.420
 about these measures that you've presented,

19:21.420 --> 19:24.900
 we should be thinking like the higher, the better,

19:24.900 --> 19:27.100
 the lower, the worse, I mean, of course,

19:27.100 --> 19:27.940
 depending on the measure.

19:27.940 --> 19:32.140
 Well, in many cases, the conflict that produces

19:32.140 --> 19:37.020
 the revolution produces revolutionary changes

19:37.020 --> 19:42.020
 that lead to resolutions and lead to new starts.

19:44.580 --> 19:49.580
 And so a short term civil war is a hellacious experience.

19:52.900 --> 19:57.660
 And at the same time, it can be the transition

19:57.660 --> 19:58.940
 to a new beginning.

19:58.940 --> 20:02.740
 Also, there are different types of conflict.

20:03.780 --> 20:08.780
 Competition, which makes things, makes everything better,

20:08.980 --> 20:13.980
 is a productive conflict, whereas destructive conflicts

20:16.000 --> 20:20.940
 are not good over the short time.

20:20.940 --> 20:23.620
 So that's how those go.

20:23.620 --> 20:28.620
 So within each measure, the story is complicated.

20:29.180 --> 20:32.300
 Yeah, but my measures are sort of clear,

20:32.300 --> 20:35.180
 meaning how much political conflict,

20:35.180 --> 20:38.780
 how much social conflict.

20:38.780 --> 20:40.620
 In other words, you can measure conflict,

20:40.620 --> 20:44.220
 you can measure fighting, you can measure crime rates,

20:44.220 --> 20:49.220
 you can measure lots of different ways of conflict.

20:49.640 --> 20:53.420
 So the measures are a composite of different types

20:53.420 --> 20:55.620
 of internal conflict.

20:55.620 --> 20:57.860
 What are some other interesting measures,

20:57.860 --> 20:59.940
 maybe if you can also mention that,

20:59.940 --> 21:03.300
 for me in particular, interest is education and innovation.

21:03.300 --> 21:08.300
 Yes, the classic cycle, the most important leading indicator

21:08.740 --> 21:11.220
 is the quality of education.

21:11.220 --> 21:16.060
 Most importantly, broad based education

21:16.060 --> 21:18.860
 drawn from the largest population

21:18.860 --> 21:23.060
 because you can never tell who the talent is going to be.

21:23.060 --> 21:25.100
 So where are they gonna come from?

21:25.100 --> 21:28.180
 So for example, if you look at the Chinese dynasties,

21:28.180 --> 21:33.180
 the great Chinese dynasties and the Confucian approach,

21:33.220 --> 21:38.220
 it was meritocratic of everybody could sit for exams

21:38.580 --> 21:41.580
 and so on broad base of drawing in the populations.

21:41.580 --> 21:44.180
 And you see that if you go across societies

21:45.140 --> 21:49.060
 because that draws on the largest number of population

21:49.060 --> 21:50.980
 to get education.

21:50.980 --> 21:55.980
 And it also, that creates a reality and a perception

21:58.260 --> 22:01.300
 that the system is fair, equal opportunity,

22:01.300 --> 22:03.020
 not just one of privilege.

22:03.020 --> 22:06.340
 And that helps to create social stability.

22:06.340 --> 22:11.340
 But education is not just education in understanding facts

22:13.820 --> 22:17.780
 and so on, it is education in civility

22:17.780 --> 22:19.260
 of how to behave together.

22:19.260 --> 22:21.260
 And so if they're smart,

22:21.260 --> 22:23.940
 they understand how to be productive

22:23.940 --> 22:27.340
 because they work well together and they're productive.

22:27.340 --> 22:30.060
 And then that leads to the next stage.

22:30.060 --> 22:35.060
 You could see in the lines in the charts, I plotted these

22:35.100 --> 22:37.700
 so that you could see in a typical cycle,

22:37.700 --> 22:42.300
 you could see that education is the long leading indicator.

22:42.300 --> 22:45.380
 And then you could see, as you mentioned,

22:45.380 --> 22:49.700
 that what you see is inventiveness and technology measures

22:49.700 --> 22:54.180
 then follow and you see then also competitiveness

22:54.180 --> 22:55.940
 and world markets follows.

22:55.940 --> 22:59.140
 For example, in the early stages of a cycle,

22:59.140 --> 23:04.140
 the industries that they go into tend to be very basic

23:04.180 --> 23:06.220
 industry because they have cheap labor,

23:06.220 --> 23:10.460
 something like textiles and simple manufactured goods

23:10.460 --> 23:11.340
 and so on.

23:11.340 --> 23:13.540
 But as the education rises,

23:13.540 --> 23:18.540
 then they move up the value chain to greater technologies

23:19.100 --> 23:23.180
 and so on, which raises incomes and raises productivity.

23:23.180 --> 23:25.940
 So yes, those and as you say,

23:25.940 --> 23:28.300
 there are 18 different measures like that,

23:28.300 --> 23:32.740
 but education and then civility and the inventiveness.

23:32.740 --> 23:37.060
 So you see it reflected in who's inventing what.

23:38.060 --> 23:41.780
 And that corresponds then who's trading with,

23:41.780 --> 23:43.620
 who's a big trading country

23:43.620 --> 23:46.180
 and where's the value of economic output

23:46.180 --> 23:47.740
 and what are per capita incomes.

23:47.740 --> 23:49.700
 They all follow those arcs.

23:51.100 --> 23:53.740
 Yeah, like you said, the fascinating thing about your book,

23:53.740 --> 23:58.620
 so there's philosophy, there's wisdom, but there's plots.

23:58.620 --> 24:01.020
 Yeah, you can see it.

24:01.020 --> 24:02.340
 So it's not just your opinion.

24:02.340 --> 24:06.300
 It's kind of like you can interpret it in any way you like,

24:06.300 --> 24:09.580
 but you're just giving a lot of your own insights

24:09.580 --> 24:12.020
 along with the numbers.

24:12.020 --> 24:15.580
 If you were to look at the American nation,

24:15.580 --> 24:18.420
 the American empire and the trajectories

24:18.420 --> 24:21.420
 looking into the future given these measures,

24:22.620 --> 24:25.940
 what is the trajectory that leads to the collapse

24:25.940 --> 24:28.860
 of the American empire based on these measures?

24:28.860 --> 24:30.540
 What are the concerning indicators

24:30.540 --> 24:34.460
 and if those break down further, what does that look like?

24:34.460 --> 24:39.460
 Well, all of those indicators are concerning,

24:41.460 --> 24:46.460
 maybe except for one, which is technology,

24:47.100 --> 24:51.100
 the technology niche, although even in that area,

24:51.100 --> 24:56.100
 the United States is improving at a slower rate

24:56.100 --> 25:00.580
 than is China for various advantages that they have there.

25:00.580 --> 25:03.900
 They put out about eight times as many computer engineers

25:03.900 --> 25:08.420
 they have free data and so on, but if you look at them,

25:08.420 --> 25:12.180
 so the financial is a concern.

25:12.180 --> 25:17.180
 The internal order, disorder is a concern.

25:17.620 --> 25:20.340
 Then if you look at education levels,

25:20.340 --> 25:23.580
 the United States is in many ways

25:23.580 --> 25:27.060
 is losing its educational advantage.

25:27.060 --> 25:30.060
 If you were to look at, compare it with China,

25:30.060 --> 25:34.500
 if you take general public education in the United States,

25:34.500 --> 25:37.420
 it's deteriorated tremendously

25:37.420 --> 25:40.300
 even in comparison to developed countries.

25:40.300 --> 25:42.460
 There are scores, PISA scores and so on,

25:42.460 --> 25:45.420
 and it's something like 38th in the world or something

25:45.420 --> 25:48.980
 and that was a big plunge, average public education.

25:48.980 --> 25:52.420
 If you look at the best universities in the world,

25:52.420 --> 25:54.140
 the United States is unique

25:54.140 --> 25:56.420
 in having the best universities in the world,

25:56.420 --> 25:58.740
 so there are these privileged universities

25:58.740 --> 26:02.340
 in the world, so there are these privileged spots

26:02.340 --> 26:06.380
 that are, you know, excellent, uniquely excellent.

26:06.380 --> 26:09.180
 So when you look at the comparison,

26:09.180 --> 26:13.660
 education in China is improving rapidly

26:13.660 --> 26:18.660
 and the quantity is a quantity of educated people

26:19.100 --> 26:23.500
 in the areas that they're moving in is greater

26:23.500 --> 26:27.140
 and the resources that they're putting behind it is greater

26:27.140 --> 26:29.460
 and so you see the results are greater,

26:30.460 --> 26:34.420
 but it's sort of along the lines that I'm dealing with.

26:34.420 --> 26:36.500
 If you were to follow through

26:36.500 --> 26:40.300
 in terms of actual productions,

26:40.300 --> 26:44.980
 I think you know in terms of technologies,

26:44.980 --> 26:48.940
 there are some areas that the United States is in a lead

26:48.940 --> 26:51.820
 at the moment, there's some areas that China's in a lead,

26:51.820 --> 26:54.900
 but China's gaining very quickly.

26:54.900 --> 26:58.140
 When I first went to China, 1984,

26:58.140 --> 27:01.100
 I would bring $10 calculators

27:01.100 --> 27:05.020
 and I gave them away as gifts to high ranking people

27:05.020 --> 27:07.300
 and they thought they were miracle devices.

27:08.700 --> 27:13.260
 Right now, in terms of areas like quantum computing

27:13.260 --> 27:18.180
 and AI and you know, many areas,

27:18.180 --> 27:20.420
 you have a race going on

27:20.420 --> 27:24.780
 and so if you take the trajectory of the competitiveness,

27:24.780 --> 27:26.900
 not just look at the current level,

27:26.900 --> 27:29.300
 you have a situation where they're improving

27:29.300 --> 27:31.180
 at a much faster rate.

27:31.180 --> 27:34.940
 This is all good for the world if the world can get along.

27:36.660 --> 27:38.580
 And the main thing I think is,

27:43.100 --> 27:44.340
 how do you have a healthy world

27:44.340 --> 27:45.900
 and how do you have a strong economy

27:45.900 --> 27:49.860
 and how do you have a strong situation is be strong.

27:49.860 --> 27:53.540
 The United States is war is with itself.

27:53.540 --> 27:55.340
 That's the main war.

27:55.340 --> 27:57.420
 You know, it's very simple in history.

27:59.500 --> 28:02.980
 Be financially sound, earn more than you spend

28:04.660 --> 28:08.140
 and be strong in these ways

28:08.140 --> 28:10.740
 and pretty much everything will take care of itself.

28:13.220 --> 28:15.140
 But you make it sound simple of course

28:15.140 --> 28:17.940
 because there's a momentum when things degrade,

28:17.940 --> 28:19.620
 when the education system degrades,

28:19.620 --> 28:21.700
 when you start borrowing,

28:21.700 --> 28:24.100
 when I mean, all of these indicators,

28:24.100 --> 28:28.380
 once they're going down, there's a momentum to it, right?

28:28.380 --> 28:30.140
 So it's hard to reverse it.

28:30.140 --> 28:33.620
 Right and there are circumstances that you're then in.

28:33.620 --> 28:36.940
 For example, indebtedness.

28:36.940 --> 28:41.100
 You know, it's politically desirable

28:41.100 --> 28:44.700
 for those to borrow money and spend

28:44.700 --> 28:49.260
 because their constituencies only look at what they get

28:49.260 --> 28:51.900
 and when they get a lot, they don't pay attention

28:51.900 --> 28:55.140
 to the balance sheet and how much debt is on the books.

28:55.140 --> 28:58.620
 So it's always better to borrow, spend

28:58.620 --> 29:01.820
 and then leave the cleanup to the next guy.

29:01.820 --> 29:04.780
 And so you inherit a lot.

29:04.780 --> 29:09.420
 You inherit it as a new president enters in

29:09.420 --> 29:13.340
 or new legislators, they have a lot of debt,

29:13.340 --> 29:16.260
 they have a broken down infrastructure,

29:16.260 --> 29:19.860
 they don't have enough money to fix that.

29:19.860 --> 29:22.420
 And so that's the lay of the land

29:22.420 --> 29:26.780
 that the prior generations put you in

29:26.780 --> 29:28.300
 and there you are.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.700
 And so that's right.

29:30.700 --> 29:33.020
 It's difficult because when you start to think,

29:33.020 --> 29:34.540
 okay, what's healthy?

29:34.540 --> 29:37.060
 Well, earn more than you spend.

29:37.060 --> 29:38.820
 Well, that's not so easy

29:38.820 --> 29:41.180
 because you know, what does that mean?

29:41.180 --> 29:42.620
 Go earn more?

29:42.620 --> 29:44.980
 I mean, okay, that's not so easy.

29:44.980 --> 29:47.220
 Spend less?

29:47.220 --> 29:49.020
 That isn't gonna work.

29:49.020 --> 29:50.620
 So now what do you do?

29:50.620 --> 29:54.180
 Okay, you have this debt that you then monetize

29:54.180 --> 29:55.660
 and that's why it's classic.

29:55.660 --> 29:57.740
 So yes, that's why these cycles occur

29:57.740 --> 30:00.740
 because what has created before,

30:00.740 --> 30:03.380
 what happened before created the lay of the land

30:03.380 --> 30:06.420
 that is then increasingly difficult to deal with.

30:06.420 --> 30:08.700
 So what can great leaders do in this moment?

30:08.700 --> 30:13.500
 I mean, maybe my sense is leadership is crucial here.

30:13.500 --> 30:16.180
 So for example, to do very large projects

30:16.180 --> 30:18.260
 and invest in the education system

30:18.260 --> 30:21.900
 that sort of try to fix the fundamentals

30:21.900 --> 30:25.900
 or maybe invest more and more into the innovation

30:25.900 --> 30:28.420
 and the development of new technologies and so on.

30:29.500 --> 30:32.860
 It feels like that just doesn't happen organically.

30:33.900 --> 30:37.660
 So you have to have strong leaders

30:37.660 --> 30:41.060
 that convince the populace

30:41.060 --> 30:43.660
 of the importance of these ideas.

30:43.660 --> 30:46.620
 Well, I completely agree with your list.

30:46.620 --> 30:48.300
 What we have is a situation

30:48.300 --> 30:52.260
 where everybody has their opinions

30:52.260 --> 30:54.780
 and they have to sort of get them exactly right

30:54.780 --> 30:56.660
 and they all fight with each other

30:56.660 --> 30:58.300
 about whether their opinions.

30:58.300 --> 31:03.300
 So the most important thing is that we become bipartisan

31:03.500 --> 31:07.020
 so that we don't and we get over our differences.

31:07.020 --> 31:10.260
 I would have a bipartisan cabinet.

31:10.260 --> 31:15.260
 I would draw upon both members of both parties,

31:15.820 --> 31:19.500
 the moderates who are going to be able to work together.

31:20.460 --> 31:24.340
 So as then we have one country

31:24.340 --> 31:27.820
 and then we deal with those in a means

31:27.820 --> 31:30.740
 that works for the majority of the people in the middle

31:30.740 --> 31:32.460
 rather than the polarity.

31:32.460 --> 31:37.460
 I think our greatest risk is in not being able to do that.

31:37.460 --> 31:41.700
 So I would say that's a paramount importance

31:41.700 --> 31:44.060
 because we have the resources,

31:45.860 --> 31:48.860
 wealth, real wealth and science

31:48.860 --> 31:51.900
 and everything has never been better than it is.

31:51.900 --> 31:54.100
 But the notion is that it has to work

31:54.100 --> 31:56.180
 for the majority of people

31:56.180 --> 31:59.820
 and we have to keep it being productive.

31:59.820 --> 32:04.820
 So that group has got to calmly and knowledgeably

32:04.820 --> 32:09.780
 work together so that they increase the size of the pie

32:09.780 --> 32:12.660
 and they create broad based prosperity.

32:12.660 --> 32:15.660
 So that is a paramount importance.

32:15.660 --> 32:18.900
 Whatever they do, if they do it that way,

32:18.900 --> 32:20.980
 I can say I'm happy about

32:20.980 --> 32:23.340
 because that other alternative

32:23.340 --> 32:25.820
 is the really scary alternative.

32:28.420 --> 32:31.500
 The scary alternative,

32:31.500 --> 32:35.860
 the different ways it has evolved throughout history,

32:35.860 --> 32:38.020
 some of it has led to wars.

32:39.420 --> 32:41.740
 What are the future trajectories

32:41.740 --> 32:44.420
 that lead to a potential war with China?

32:44.420 --> 32:46.980
 Cold war or hot war?

32:46.980 --> 32:48.260
 Is this something you think about?

32:48.260 --> 32:50.260
 Is this something you're worried about?

32:50.260 --> 32:52.380
 Yeah, I'd like to talk about both wars.

32:52.380 --> 32:54.940
 So the war with China, as I say,

32:54.940 --> 32:56.860
 there are five kinds of wars.

32:56.860 --> 33:01.860
 There's a trade war, technology war, geopolitical influence

33:02.420 --> 33:07.260
 war, capital war, and military war.

33:08.780 --> 33:10.700
 As far as military war goes,

33:10.700 --> 33:15.700
 I think it's only a Taiwan issue, but that's a big issue.

33:16.500 --> 33:18.740
 And we could talk about that for a minute,

33:18.740 --> 33:22.940
 but those others, they'll be rough competitions

33:22.940 --> 33:27.620
 and we'll have that type of evolution over a period of time.

33:27.620 --> 33:30.420
 That's what that war looks like.

33:30.420 --> 33:34.140
 Taiwan has been, for a long time,

33:35.940 --> 33:38.460
 a sovereignty issue to China.

33:40.540 --> 33:42.900
 And it has its roots

33:42.900 --> 33:46.100
 in what's called the 100 years of humiliation.

33:47.140 --> 33:52.140
 From the 1840s to 1949, foreign powers came in,

33:52.140 --> 33:56.140
 took advantage of China, they had the opium wars

33:56.140 --> 34:00.660
 and such times, and that represented

34:00.660 --> 34:03.060
 the 100 years of humiliation.

34:03.060 --> 34:08.060
 And Taiwan represents their sovereignty

34:09.140 --> 34:11.020
 and their important thing.

34:11.020 --> 34:14.620
 And 50 years ago, starting 50 years ago,

34:14.620 --> 34:18.420
 there was an agreement that there is one China

34:18.420 --> 34:21.580
 and Taiwan is part of China.

34:21.580 --> 34:26.580
 And that there would be peaceful reunification.

34:26.980 --> 34:31.460
 The peaceful reunification hasn't happened.

34:31.460 --> 34:34.940
 And in their view, that's a very big issue.

34:34.940 --> 34:37.540
 And so it's a big contentious issue.

34:37.540 --> 34:41.820
 And that could produce a military war,

34:41.820 --> 34:43.540
 could produce a military accident,

34:43.540 --> 34:46.020
 could produce, it's a very tense situation.

34:46.020 --> 34:49.820
 And if we had a military war, God help us

34:49.820 --> 34:53.660
 because of the capacity in all different new ways

34:53.660 --> 34:56.380
 to inflict harm on each other.

34:56.380 --> 34:58.700
 But anyway, that's that.

34:58.700 --> 35:01.700
 If you don't have that military war,

35:01.700 --> 35:06.340
 you'll have the competition between those other kinds of wars

35:06.340 --> 35:11.340
 and whoever is strongest in those areas will win.

35:11.380 --> 35:14.660
 Where do you put cyber war within the five?

35:14.660 --> 35:17.380
 Well, cyber war is a military war.

35:17.380 --> 35:22.020
 I'm assuming the type of cyber war that you're referring to

35:22.020 --> 35:24.580
 is that which is used to inflict pain

35:24.580 --> 35:26.780
 on the other party through cyber.

35:26.780 --> 35:29.700
 So cyber wars, you'll see cyber war.

35:29.700 --> 35:31.900
 You could see space war.

35:31.900 --> 35:34.380
 You can see drone warfare.

35:35.900 --> 35:40.500
 New types of warfare, not just the traditional

35:40.500 --> 35:42.680
 and nuclear type of warfare.

35:42.680 --> 35:44.380
 But you could see any of the above.

35:44.380 --> 35:48.860
 What are the defining characteristics?

35:48.860 --> 35:51.700
 What are the interesting things about Xi Jinping,

35:51.700 --> 35:55.900
 the president of China, as a leader on the world stage?

35:55.900 --> 36:00.340
 His father was a early leader.

36:01.660 --> 36:06.660
 He was himself in the Cultural Revolution in times,

36:09.380 --> 36:12.260
 treated brutally.

36:12.260 --> 36:17.260
 And during that period of time, it was very, very difficult.

36:17.820 --> 36:21.500
 And he came up through the ranks

36:21.500 --> 36:25.280
 and he's a very intelligent man.

36:26.540 --> 36:29.300
 When he first came to power,

36:29.300 --> 36:32.140
 as you know, they have two five year terms,

36:32.140 --> 36:34.620
 and we're now coming to the end

36:34.620 --> 36:36.740
 of the second of those five year terms.

36:36.740 --> 36:38.980
 When he first came to power,

36:38.980 --> 36:42.860
 he felt that there should be a lot of reform.

36:42.860 --> 36:46.540
 And reform meant moving to much more

36:46.540 --> 36:49.380
 of a market and open economy.

36:49.380 --> 36:53.140
 When that happened, him coming in,

36:53.140 --> 36:56.940
 I had some contact with economic policymakers,

36:56.940 --> 36:59.340
 but in the circumstances then,

36:59.340 --> 37:03.860
 were that five major banks lent to state owned enterprises

37:03.860 --> 37:07.820
 and local governments with implied government guarantees.

37:07.820 --> 37:10.100
 And so there was not control of that

37:10.100 --> 37:14.100
 and the movement to aim more of a market economy.

37:14.100 --> 37:17.780
 And the development of markets was a primary

37:17.780 --> 37:20.900
 and also the dealing with the corruption issue.

37:20.900 --> 37:24.140
 There was a lot of corruption prior to that,

37:24.140 --> 37:28.500
 and that was viewed as an existential threat to the system.

37:28.500 --> 37:31.620
 So that became the primary objective.

37:31.620 --> 37:36.620
 And then as time progressed over those 10 years,

37:36.620 --> 37:41.620
 there was a lot of changing in the world,

37:42.020 --> 37:43.820
 their financial circumstances,

37:43.820 --> 37:46.940
 opening many, many other markets.

37:46.940 --> 37:48.460
 They particularly getting money

37:48.460 --> 37:51.180
 to small and medium sized enterprises

37:51.180 --> 37:52.940
 and developing a lending system

37:52.940 --> 37:55.340
 and then establishing controls on it.

37:55.340 --> 38:00.340
 So right now there's a vibrant capital markets.

38:00.340 --> 38:03.340
 You can raise capital, you can be an entrepreneur,

38:03.340 --> 38:07.860
 you can become a billionaire in the capital markets.

38:07.860 --> 38:09.180
 And they developed the markets

38:09.180 --> 38:11.900
 to be the second largest capital markets.

38:11.900 --> 38:15.700
 At the same time, they had to deal

38:15.700 --> 38:18.540
 with their rising debt issue,

38:18.540 --> 38:23.540
 which they began to deal with really about four years ago,

38:24.060 --> 38:27.740
 when the second largest capital markets

38:27.740 --> 38:32.740
 were about four years ago, when the second term began.

38:33.460 --> 38:38.460
 And then Lu He became the vice premier

38:41.740 --> 38:46.340
 responsible for that and to deal with those issues.

38:46.340 --> 38:49.860
 So you see right now that what's happening

38:49.860 --> 38:53.140
 is the dealing with the real estate bubble.

38:53.140 --> 38:55.980
 There was a development in real estate, a bubble,

38:55.980 --> 38:59.980
 which produced a lot of unproductive lending.

38:59.980 --> 39:04.980
 And Xi Jinping said, houses are meant to live in,

39:06.500 --> 39:08.260
 not to speculate on.

39:08.260 --> 39:09.860
 And so that was wasteful.

39:09.860 --> 39:12.900
 So they established what they call three red lines,

39:12.900 --> 39:14.900
 which are financial ratios,

39:14.900 --> 39:18.380
 that the property developers had to live within.

39:18.380 --> 39:21.820
 And that is then causing the adjustments

39:21.820 --> 39:25.260
 that are going on now, which in my view are very healthy

39:25.260 --> 39:28.980
 because whenever there's bankruptcies

39:28.980 --> 39:33.140
 and so on, most in the public think, okay, that's a problem.

39:33.140 --> 39:36.300
 It's in many cases really a cleaning up of bad debts

39:36.300 --> 39:37.420
 and bad practices.

39:37.420 --> 39:40.060
 And so that's what's going on.

39:40.060 --> 39:42.620
 So that's, let's say economically.

39:42.620 --> 39:47.620
 At the same time, there is the changing relationships,

39:48.220 --> 39:51.500
 the changing world order, the changing relationships

39:51.500 --> 39:54.140
 with the United States and other countries,

39:54.140 --> 39:57.940
 which is becoming much less cooperative

39:57.940 --> 40:01.620
 and much more warlike, much more confrontational.

40:02.660 --> 40:06.780
 Those two things, the domestic debt problem

40:06.780 --> 40:11.140
 and the domestic, has led to what's called core,

40:11.140 --> 40:13.140
 what they call core leadership,

40:13.140 --> 40:17.180
 which means a leadership more around him

40:17.180 --> 40:21.180
 that is less challenging

40:21.180 --> 40:23.380
 because they believe in history

40:23.380 --> 40:26.300
 that during very difficult times,

40:26.300 --> 40:29.820
 a more centrally controlled decision making process

40:29.820 --> 40:32.740
 lends itself better than to a more fragmented

40:32.740 --> 40:35.020
 political contentious project.

40:35.020 --> 40:38.340
 And that's basically what's going on now.

40:39.820 --> 40:42.060
 You said it very eloquently,

40:42.060 --> 40:46.580
 but you mean the leadership is surrounded by yes men

40:46.580 --> 40:50.100
 and there's a lot of centralized control.

40:50.100 --> 40:55.100
 That characterization is much more black and white

40:55.420 --> 40:56.620
 than it really is.

40:57.620 --> 41:00.340
 But it leans towards that direction.

41:00.340 --> 41:02.300
 Like for example, of the standing members

41:02.300 --> 41:05.180
 of the Politburo, four are more allotted,

41:07.100 --> 41:09.460
 three are less so.

41:09.460 --> 41:11.540
 You have to understand that it's kind of

41:11.540 --> 41:14.580
 a collective leadership at the top.

41:14.580 --> 41:18.580
 And then of course, there's just jockeying for power

41:18.580 --> 41:22.580
 in a highly political sense at the top.

41:22.580 --> 41:25.980
 But no one leader can be successful

41:25.980 --> 41:30.180
 against all those powers at the top.

41:30.180 --> 41:32.900
 So it's very politically negotiating.

41:32.900 --> 41:37.540
 It's very much more like if you put in the United States

41:37.540 --> 41:39.500
 the Democrats and the Republicans

41:39.500 --> 41:41.340
 and they had to be in the same government

41:41.340 --> 41:43.060
 and they work it out.

41:43.060 --> 41:45.140
 It's kind of something like that.

41:45.140 --> 41:49.740
 And so that's that struggle, but it's an internal struggle.

41:49.740 --> 41:53.020
 Where do you put the importance of some of these ideas

41:53.020 --> 41:55.260
 at the founding of the United States

41:55.260 --> 41:59.340
 when now we're talking about that at the context of China,

41:59.340 --> 42:02.460
 the freedom of speech, freedoms?

42:02.460 --> 42:04.600
 What China is doing with the central management

42:04.600 --> 42:08.500
 of a lot of things, it's enabling a lot of growth,

42:08.500 --> 42:12.860
 but it's also limiting people on the very basic level

42:12.860 --> 42:13.900
 in terms of freedom.

42:13.900 --> 42:17.260
 The kind of freedom that I think can lead

42:17.260 --> 42:19.740
 to entrepreneurship, to starting new businesses,

42:19.740 --> 42:21.940
 to having big dreams and chasing those dreams

42:21.940 --> 42:25.080
 and then creating totally new things in whatever the space,

42:25.080 --> 42:29.040
 maybe in technology, in business and whatever.

42:30.340 --> 42:33.420
 How important is that as a metric for society?

42:33.420 --> 42:38.060
 Well, they have a view, which is the idea of a dialectic,

42:38.060 --> 42:41.360
 which means that two things are at obvious,

42:41.360 --> 42:43.620
 that everything comes with pros and cons

42:43.620 --> 42:46.540
 and two opposites exist.

42:46.540 --> 42:50.100
 And you want the benefits of those two opposites

42:50.100 --> 42:54.020
 and how do you deal with the benefits of those two opposites?

42:54.020 --> 42:57.380
 So let's say you want the capital markets

42:57.380 --> 43:02.020
 because it gets money into the hands of the entrepreneurs

43:02.020 --> 43:04.420
 who are motivated, they build fortunes,

43:04.420 --> 43:07.820
 and that drives an economy to do very well.

43:07.820 --> 43:12.740
 And at the same time, it produces the other problems,

43:12.740 --> 43:15.460
 the wealth gaps, the other problems,

43:15.460 --> 43:18.420
 the debt cycle that we're talking about and so on.

43:18.420 --> 43:23.320
 And Deng Xiaoping, how do you reconcile communism

43:23.320 --> 43:27.540
 and the market economy and the capital markets?

43:27.540 --> 43:30.060
 And he famously said,

43:32.180 --> 43:34.360
 it doesn't matter if it's a white cat or a black cat,

43:34.360 --> 43:36.340
 just as long as it catches mice.

43:36.340 --> 43:40.620
 In other words, if it works in making the country richer,

43:40.620 --> 43:42.280
 then that becomes the objective

43:42.280 --> 43:43.620
 and then they move that along.

43:43.620 --> 43:45.480
 So there are these conflicts.

43:46.500 --> 43:51.400
 And one of the leaders described it to me as follows,

43:51.400 --> 43:53.940
 because it's confusion and it goes back

43:53.940 --> 43:55.660
 over a period of time.

43:55.660 --> 44:00.020
 There's a hierarchy and it's an extension of the family,

44:00.020 --> 44:01.280
 he described it.

44:01.280 --> 44:06.280
 And he said, the United States is a country of individuals

44:06.600 --> 44:11.600
 and individualism, and that is its vibrancy

44:11.600 --> 44:16.600
 that we see the individual rights to speak up,

44:17.640 --> 44:22.440
 the individual protection of the individual,

44:22.440 --> 44:25.540
 individual property rights and all of those things

44:25.540 --> 44:28.280
 is of paramount importance.

44:28.280 --> 44:29.920
 And we build our organization.

44:29.920 --> 44:32.080
 That's why democracy is from the bottom up

44:32.080 --> 44:34.280
 or even a company, we'll get together

44:34.280 --> 44:37.480
 and we'll be partners to prosper together.

44:37.480 --> 44:39.460
 That is the American approach.

44:39.460 --> 44:43.380
 He was describing that in China,

44:43.380 --> 44:47.860
 it's an extension of the Confucian family, essentially.

44:47.860 --> 44:52.380
 And so it's almost like there's a hierarchy.

44:52.380 --> 44:57.040
 And so what they think about is the common good,

44:57.040 --> 44:59.420
 not the individualism.

44:59.420 --> 45:02.100
 So for example, if they want a high speed rail

45:02.100 --> 45:04.100
 to go from one place to another,

45:04.100 --> 45:06.720
 and that's best in the common good,

45:06.720 --> 45:08.820
 then the individual protections

45:08.820 --> 45:11.300
 that would stand in the way of doing that

45:11.300 --> 45:13.660
 would be of secondary concern.

45:13.660 --> 45:17.220
 So that notion of controlling.

45:17.220 --> 45:22.220
 So for example, what they're doing with video games,

45:24.180 --> 45:28.240
 they control what type of video games

45:28.240 --> 45:32.720
 and how many hours a day kids can be on video games

45:33.900 --> 45:35.660
 operating in that way,

45:35.660 --> 45:38.980
 because they believe that that's good for the society

45:38.980 --> 45:40.780
 and that's very controlling.

45:40.780 --> 45:42.220
 In the United States,

45:42.220 --> 45:45.100
 I think probably most parents would say, leave it to me.

45:45.100 --> 45:48.340
 And it's a matter between me and my kids.

45:48.340 --> 45:50.660
 The same thing has to do with data.

45:50.660 --> 45:52.840
 In other words, in the United States,

45:52.840 --> 45:54.340
 who controls the data?

45:55.220 --> 45:57.340
 Does the company control the data?

45:57.340 --> 46:00.020
 Do you individually control the data?

46:00.020 --> 46:03.580
 And so the inclination would be to figure that out,

46:03.580 --> 46:05.640
 but nobody would say that the government

46:05.640 --> 46:07.460
 is going to control the data

46:07.460 --> 46:11.780
 because of our inclination of really anti government control.

46:11.780 --> 46:14.180
 In China, it would be that the government

46:14.180 --> 46:15.860
 will control the data

46:15.860 --> 46:18.900
 because that's going to be best for the society.

46:18.900 --> 46:20.340
 And it depends who you trust.

46:20.340 --> 46:24.700
 But that's, so that difference in philosophy

46:24.700 --> 46:28.660
 is very much at the heart of that.

46:28.660 --> 46:33.100
 As far as your question in terms of effectiveness,

46:33.100 --> 46:35.940
 it really is, in China's case,

46:35.940 --> 46:38.140
 it's how you balance the things, right?

46:38.140 --> 46:40.020
 So what they're attempting to do

46:40.020 --> 46:43.660
 is to create a lot of freedom and creativity

46:44.680 --> 46:48.520
 in areas that are not political, let's say.

46:50.260 --> 46:53.860
 And so you see a lot of entrepreneurship,

46:53.860 --> 46:55.940
 you see a lot of product development,

46:55.940 --> 47:00.620
 you see a lot of creativity happening in that way.

47:00.620 --> 47:04.900
 So the stereotype that you don't see creativity happening

47:04.900 --> 47:06.740
 is an old stereotype,

47:06.740 --> 47:09.220
 whereas a lot of creativity is certainly happening.

47:09.220 --> 47:10.900
 And the system can work well

47:10.900 --> 47:13.260
 if they can achieve that kind of balance.

47:13.260 --> 47:15.060
 It's proven to have worked well.

47:15.060 --> 47:18.300
 Since I started going there in 1984,

47:18.300 --> 47:21.100
 per capita income, real per capita income,

47:21.100 --> 47:24.160
 has increased by 26 times.

47:24.160 --> 47:28.940
 The longevity rate has increased by 10 years.

47:28.940 --> 47:33.260
 The poverty rate has fallen from 88% to less than 1%

47:33.260 --> 47:37.380
 in terms of basics like starvation and things.

47:37.380 --> 47:41.740
 And if you read history, Plato's Republic,

47:41.740 --> 47:46.380
 he talks about the cycles, democracy and autocratic

47:46.380 --> 47:49.220
 and the benevolent despot and all of that,

47:50.140 --> 47:53.340
 each has their own vulnerability.

47:53.340 --> 47:55.660
 The vulnerability of democracy,

47:55.660 --> 47:58.780
 which has been a remarkable, remarkable system

47:58.780 --> 48:02.040
 and I don't have to extol the benefits of it,

48:02.980 --> 48:07.980
 but the vulnerability of it has always been

48:07.980 --> 48:12.940
 the internal conflict that produces itself as anarchy.

48:13.900 --> 48:18.620
 In World War II, four democracies

48:18.620 --> 48:21.980
 chose to be autocracies

48:22.980 --> 48:25.980
 because there was internal disorder

48:25.980 --> 48:30.220
 and there was the belief, will somebody bring about order

48:30.220 --> 48:32.660
 and get control of the situation?

48:32.660 --> 48:37.660
 That was in Germany, Italy, Japan and Spain.

48:38.040 --> 48:41.180
 They were parliamentary systems

48:41.180 --> 48:43.840
 that turned themselves over to that.

48:43.840 --> 48:48.840
 So both systems have vulnerabilities.

48:49.460 --> 48:53.300
 I think the main thing that we need to think about

48:53.300 --> 48:54.820
 is those vulnerabilities.

48:54.820 --> 48:58.340
 Democracy is an amazing system

48:58.340 --> 49:03.340
 because the adherence to the rules and the system

49:03.500 --> 49:06.860
 and the checks and balances is quite amazing

49:06.860 --> 49:10.480
 and it gives it a flexibility to change without civil wars.

49:12.460 --> 49:15.060
 But there has to be the respect of the rules.

49:15.060 --> 49:18.060
 And when you see something like

49:18.060 --> 49:22.500
 they will not accept elections

49:22.500 --> 49:27.020
 or they will not accept rules, history has shown,

49:27.020 --> 49:29.660
 when the causes that people are behind

49:29.660 --> 49:32.340
 are more important to them than the system,

49:32.340 --> 49:34.420
 the system is in jeopardy.

49:34.420 --> 49:38.260
 So we have a situation that's very much like that

49:38.260 --> 49:42.500
 in terms of, let's say, the 2024 elections.

49:42.500 --> 49:46.740
 I believe that there's a very high chance

49:46.740 --> 49:51.740
 that neither side will accept losing, for example.

49:51.740 --> 49:56.260
 And so we have that kind of a situation.

49:56.260 --> 50:00.140
 So one would hope that one could rise above

50:00.140 --> 50:04.740
 the disagreements and rely on the system

50:04.740 --> 50:06.900
 for resolving disagreements.

50:06.900 --> 50:11.700
 Because if that doesn't happen, then we have our own chaos.

50:13.300 --> 50:16.780
 So the kind of the trend that started in 2020,

50:16.780 --> 50:19.860
 or I mean, I suppose it's been there,

50:19.860 --> 50:22.060
 it's been growing.

50:22.060 --> 50:24.280
 One representation of this internal disorder

50:24.280 --> 50:27.460
 has been the growing trend of being skeptical

50:27.460 --> 50:29.700
 about the results of the election.

50:29.700 --> 50:31.680
 Well, it started before that.

50:31.680 --> 50:35.140
 There was the emergence of population

50:35.140 --> 50:40.000
 before President Trump was elected.

50:40.000 --> 50:43.340
 He was basically elected as a populist

50:43.340 --> 50:46.840
 because there was a large percentage of the population

50:46.840 --> 50:50.700
 that felt that the system didn't work for them.

50:50.700 --> 50:52.660
 And he tapped into that.

50:52.660 --> 50:56.100
 And he was largely elected as a populist leader,

50:56.100 --> 50:59.480
 first populist leader in a developed country.

51:00.620 --> 51:04.260
 And so populism began then.

51:04.260 --> 51:08.460
 And that was a battle of one group against the other group.

51:08.460 --> 51:12.140
 And so since then, it's been like that

51:12.140 --> 51:17.140
 and it continued to grow.

51:17.940 --> 51:22.940
 You've mentioned the vulnerability of democracy,

51:23.020 --> 51:26.620
 that internal disorder is the vulnerability of democracy.

51:26.620 --> 51:29.460
 What's the vulnerability of a system like China?

51:29.460 --> 51:32.460
 Maybe one way to say is put China aside

51:32.460 --> 51:34.980
 and look at history, look at Soviet Union.

51:34.980 --> 51:39.880
 What's the vulnerability of a communist type system?

51:39.880 --> 51:44.880
 Well, I'll call it both communist and autocratic,

51:46.500 --> 51:48.940
 depending on how much autocracy,

51:48.940 --> 51:52.540
 is that it lacks flexibility.

51:52.540 --> 51:56.100
 It lacks the ability,

51:57.140 --> 51:59.580
 but I should deal with them differently.

51:59.580 --> 52:02.180
 In other words, there's the economic system.

52:02.180 --> 52:07.180
 The economic system threatens motivation and productivity.

52:07.180 --> 52:12.180
 So communism or socialism has to be done in a way

52:12.460 --> 52:16.940
 where you can threaten productivity.

52:16.940 --> 52:20.420
 Capitalism has, and what I mean by that,

52:20.420 --> 52:24.620
 I mean free markets and capital markets

52:24.620 --> 52:28.380
 have been an effective way of allocating resources

52:28.380 --> 52:33.380
 and also creating the incentives and the resources,

52:33.380 --> 52:37.620
 providing the resources for the inventiveness of new ideas.

52:37.620 --> 52:42.500
 And so if I compare that, what the Chinese have done

52:42.500 --> 52:45.540
 to a large extent is to recognize that

52:45.540 --> 52:47.220
 and have made a move.

52:47.220 --> 52:52.140
 That's why the seeming dialectic or the conflict

52:52.140 --> 52:53.740
 between those two things exists.

52:53.740 --> 52:55.580
 But anyway, that's it.

52:55.580 --> 52:57.860
 As far as an autocratic system,

52:57.860 --> 53:02.860
 rather than one man, one vote from the population up,

53:04.300 --> 53:07.340
 the risks of the autocratic system

53:07.340 --> 53:11.300
 is that there's enough discontent that arises

53:12.260 --> 53:16.600
 that the system doesn't have the flexibility

53:16.600 --> 53:20.580
 and that rather than bending, it breaks.

53:21.480 --> 53:24.180
 That's the big risk.

53:24.180 --> 53:28.220
 The notion of trying to control a population

53:28.220 --> 53:31.420
 if there's that, rather than giving it the flexibility.

53:32.380 --> 53:36.180
 So that would be the big risk of the autocratic system.

53:36.180 --> 53:39.260
 What's the human, because you mentioned

53:39.260 --> 53:41.580
 like the top gets bigger with the empires

53:42.460 --> 53:44.800
 and you start to get things for granted.

53:45.780 --> 53:48.340
 Is some of this just human nature?

53:48.340 --> 53:53.340
 So the concern with China, with autocratic nations,

53:53.340 --> 53:58.340
 the concern with the Third Reich, the Soviet Union,

53:59.940 --> 54:03.580
 was that fundamentally at the individual level,

54:03.580 --> 54:06.460
 the humans involved at the top,

54:06.460 --> 54:09.600
 they start becoming, they're starting to lose touch

54:09.600 --> 54:13.460
 with reality in a way that no longer makes them.

54:13.460 --> 54:14.900
 I guess that's the representation,

54:14.900 --> 54:16.980
 the flexibility that you're referring to.

54:16.980 --> 54:21.180
 Well, I mean, in a democracy, you could change.

54:21.180 --> 54:23.580
 You can go as far left or as far right.

54:23.580 --> 54:25.780
 You can change the leaders easily.

54:25.780 --> 54:27.700
 And so the people don't become,

54:28.900 --> 54:31.140
 they pretty much only have themselves to blame.

54:32.860 --> 54:35.680
 And one of the problems of that

54:35.680 --> 54:37.980
 is they may not choose the best leaders,

54:39.300 --> 54:42.340
 but they have that flexibility.

54:42.340 --> 54:46.180
 So vote and you get what you wanted.

54:46.180 --> 54:49.040
 In the case of the autocratic, let's say leaders,

54:49.040 --> 54:53.060
 and then the movement from democracies to autocracies,

54:54.040 --> 54:57.420
 what you see normally that movement

54:57.420 --> 55:00.560
 is that one of the systems is not working.

55:00.560 --> 55:02.940
 Let's say the democracy is not effectively,

55:02.940 --> 55:04.500
 everybody's arguing with each other

55:04.500 --> 55:06.620
 and nobody's getting anything done.

55:06.620 --> 55:08.180
 You know, like Mussolini,

55:08.180 --> 55:10.340
 the trains are not running on time.

55:10.340 --> 55:12.240
 And that would be the example,

55:12.240 --> 55:14.540
 geez, this place has gotten chaotic.

55:14.540 --> 55:16.700
 Will somebody get to control?

55:16.700 --> 55:19.660
 And then you get the autocratic

55:20.520 --> 55:24.780
 and then he's autocratic enough to boss people around.

55:24.780 --> 55:29.060
 And then you follow those kinds of orders.

55:29.060 --> 55:32.700
 And it's like maybe a CEO in a powerful company

55:32.700 --> 55:34.620
 going around and that could work well

55:34.620 --> 55:36.380
 or it could work badly.

55:36.380 --> 55:41.380
 Most companies are run as like autocracies in a sense.

55:41.380 --> 55:44.980
 You know, there's the hierarchy and the command economy

55:44.980 --> 55:46.660
 and that kind of thing.

55:46.660 --> 55:51.660
 And that can work well or not.

55:51.660 --> 55:56.660
 But then quite often when you get the populist autocratic,

55:56.660 --> 56:00.260
 their personality is something that they want to fight

56:01.220 --> 56:03.780
 and they become more nationalistic

56:04.740 --> 56:07.700
 and they tend to become more militaristic.

56:07.700 --> 56:12.700
 And human nature at that stage lends itself to fighting.

56:13.180 --> 56:18.180
 There's an arc here that when we think of a country

56:18.740 --> 56:22.220
 and we say we, and we think of a country,

56:22.220 --> 56:24.660
 it's not true, it's not like that.

56:24.660 --> 56:26.940
 There are individuals who change.

56:26.940 --> 56:30.940
 One generation dies and another generation comes along.

56:30.940 --> 56:35.940
 And one of those arcs is that the one generation

56:35.940 --> 56:39.860
 of the ones who have been through war

56:39.860 --> 56:44.260
 don't wanna go to war and are more happily willing

56:44.260 --> 56:47.980
 to abide by whatever the rules are.

56:47.980 --> 56:50.940
 As you get farther along into that cycle

56:50.940 --> 56:53.940
 and you get a new generation and they forget about wars

56:53.940 --> 56:58.940
 and the horrors of wars, then they want to fight.

56:59.580 --> 57:02.820
 And so you're seeing right now the emerging

57:02.820 --> 57:06.420
 of fight for right and what that means

57:06.420 --> 57:10.700
 is you see it internally, fight where are you

57:10.700 --> 57:14.860
 and fight for that thing and they mean fight.

57:14.860 --> 57:19.340
 And then externally, fight, are you going to be

57:19.340 --> 57:21.860
 the strong one who will fight and win?

57:21.860 --> 57:26.060
 And that develops on both sides, this fight and win

57:26.060 --> 57:30.300
 and each side is cheering each other on into a war.

57:30.300 --> 57:34.700
 But that comes by those who really have not experienced war

57:34.700 --> 57:37.580
 because it comes in their part of their lifetime.

57:38.740 --> 57:40.660
 Humans are fascinating.

57:40.660 --> 57:41.940
 Humans are fascinating.

57:41.940 --> 57:45.700
 And by the way, human nature has not changed

57:45.700 --> 57:48.260
 over the thousands of years.

57:48.260 --> 57:51.980
 So it's so interesting because like in doing this study

57:51.980 --> 57:54.060
 and it comes across in the study,

57:54.060 --> 57:56.700
 it's like watching the same movie over and over again.

57:56.700 --> 58:01.100
 You know, you see the arc and you see it happen

58:01.100 --> 58:02.580
 over and over again.

58:02.580 --> 58:05.300
 The only things that seem to change are the clothes

58:05.300 --> 58:07.660
 people wear and the technologies they use.

58:07.660 --> 58:12.660
 Yeah, and then somebody probably would disagree

58:12.900 --> 58:13.740
 with you about the clothes.

58:13.740 --> 58:16.300
 Maybe there's also cycles within fashions.

58:16.300 --> 58:18.580
 Maybe we're not even creative there.

58:18.580 --> 58:23.580
 What do you make of Russia and Vladimir Putin?

58:23.580 --> 58:26.420
 What do you think about Putin as a leader,

58:26.420 --> 58:30.460
 as a human being on this world stage within the context

58:30.460 --> 58:33.900
 of the cycles of empires that you think about?

58:33.900 --> 58:38.420
 Well, Putin came to power at the failure

58:38.420 --> 58:41.220
 of Russia's last order.

58:41.220 --> 58:43.500
 So there was the end of communism

58:45.260 --> 58:47.980
 and there was the development of the market economy,

58:47.980 --> 58:50.140
 the collapse of the Soviet Union.

58:50.140 --> 58:55.140
 And at that time, he was appointed by Yeltsin

58:57.420 --> 59:02.420
 who was an alcoholic and had problems managing

59:03.220 --> 59:05.260
 and was put into power.

59:05.260 --> 59:08.740
 And the conditions in the Russia were,

59:08.740 --> 59:12.580
 there was anarchy, there was no money.

59:12.580 --> 59:15.540
 It had the classic end of cycle ingredients.

59:15.540 --> 59:16.660
 It was broke.

59:16.660 --> 59:18.700
 It was people were fighting with each other.

59:18.700 --> 59:20.180
 It was in the anarchy.

59:20.180 --> 59:23.180
 And that's when he came to power.

59:23.180 --> 59:27.620
 And there were not institutions.

59:27.620 --> 59:29.180
 The whole thing had collapsed

59:29.180 --> 59:31.980
 and it was not effective ministry of education,

59:31.980 --> 59:33.100
 ministry of anything.

59:34.180 --> 59:39.180
 And so the idea was that they needed 25 years of stability

59:41.220 --> 59:43.740
 and they needed a democracy

59:43.740 --> 59:47.580
 and they needed the improvement of capital markets.

59:47.580 --> 59:52.580
 So he's been in that position as I guess I would call him

59:56.820 --> 1:00:01.820
 a semi autocratic leader in that from all indications,

1:00:02.780 --> 1:00:07.780
 he would respect the democracy and he's very popular.

1:00:07.860 --> 1:00:10.180
 He's won democratic elections

1:00:10.180 --> 1:00:11.980
 because he's been a strong leader

1:00:11.980 --> 1:00:16.140
 and he's brought peace and stability

1:00:16.140 --> 1:00:21.140
 to Russia after the breakup of the Soviet Union.

1:00:21.780 --> 1:00:26.780
 And he's a strong leader in pursuit of the country's interest

1:00:31.340 --> 1:00:36.340
 in a way where Russia is not a significant economic power

1:00:41.380 --> 1:00:43.820
 but it is a significant military power.

1:00:43.820 --> 1:00:48.820
 So the issues, and then there's a strong alliance

1:00:48.820 --> 1:00:50.500
 between Russia and China now.

1:00:51.900 --> 1:00:54.740
 So that's kind of the lay of the land.

1:00:55.620 --> 1:00:58.060
 And then there are sensitivities.

1:00:58.060 --> 1:01:02.580
 The Ukraine issue is a sensitivity

1:01:02.580 --> 1:01:05.900
 because of there are a lot of Russians

1:01:05.900 --> 1:01:07.700
 who live in the Ukraine

1:01:07.700 --> 1:01:11.580
 and there's also the issue of NATO on their border.

1:01:11.580 --> 1:01:13.540
 So there are those kinds of things

1:01:13.540 --> 1:01:14.980
 and he has military power

1:01:14.980 --> 1:01:17.620
 and he has a strong alliance with China.

1:01:18.900 --> 1:01:21.700
 And I guess that's my best summary

1:01:21.700 --> 1:01:24.140
 of what his position is.

1:01:24.140 --> 1:01:28.140
 He's a strong leader, popular.

1:01:30.500 --> 1:01:33.340
 These are not subjective interpretations.

1:01:33.340 --> 1:01:35.900
 These are objective interpretations.

1:01:35.900 --> 1:01:38.940
 Yeah, it's interesting just in this conversation,

1:01:38.940 --> 1:01:43.940
 you're not sort of doing the usual criticism

1:01:43.940 --> 1:01:45.500
 of any one particular system.

1:01:45.500 --> 1:01:46.740
 You're looking at these systems

1:01:46.740 --> 1:01:48.700
 from the perspective of history.

1:01:48.700 --> 1:01:50.900
 You're just describing how they work.

1:01:50.900 --> 1:01:54.340
 It's often times when you talk about what Russia is today

1:01:54.340 --> 1:01:57.340
 or what the Soviet Union was or what China is today

1:01:57.340 --> 1:01:58.820
 is you start to criticize.

1:01:58.820 --> 1:02:01.180
 Well, they do this kind of censorship

1:02:01.180 --> 1:02:02.540
 or they do this kind of,

1:02:02.540 --> 1:02:05.060
 they limit freedoms in this kind of way.

1:02:05.060 --> 1:02:07.060
 But you're just kind of describing this

1:02:07.060 --> 1:02:11.300
 as a nation with ideas, what they think is right.

1:02:11.300 --> 1:02:13.300
 This is how they hope to get it to work.

1:02:13.300 --> 1:02:14.580
 This is why it's working.

1:02:14.580 --> 1:02:16.300
 This is what's not working.

1:02:16.300 --> 1:02:19.380
 Here's metrics that show that it's not working.

1:02:19.380 --> 1:02:21.740
 I think that's a refreshing way to think about it.

1:02:21.740 --> 1:02:24.300
 It's easy though, I mean, you got some criticism

1:02:25.500 --> 1:02:28.020
 saying that I think China is a strict parent.

1:02:30.580 --> 1:02:33.140
 Some people criticize these countries for doing,

1:02:33.140 --> 1:02:35.980
 for violating human rights.

1:02:35.980 --> 1:02:39.580
 I suppose there's some people that criticize the United States

1:02:39.580 --> 1:02:41.100
 for violating human rights.

1:02:41.100 --> 1:02:46.100
 But what are your thoughts on the world stage today

1:02:48.180 --> 1:02:51.740
 about some of the behaviors it has governed

1:02:51.740 --> 1:02:53.340
 in terms of respecting the rights,

1:02:53.340 --> 1:02:55.380
 the basic rights of human beings?

1:02:55.380 --> 1:03:00.380
 You described accurately how I just tried to look at this

1:03:00.380 --> 1:03:05.380
 and how I just tried to look at things in a non,

1:03:05.820 --> 1:03:10.700
 I don't want to impute my values on anybody.

1:03:12.180 --> 1:03:14.060
 I mean, there are intolerable things.

1:03:14.060 --> 1:03:16.820
 So I'm not saying there aren't intolerable things.

1:03:16.820 --> 1:03:20.380
 But one of the great things of being an American here

1:03:20.380 --> 1:03:23.900
 is that I grew up with all different nationalities,

1:03:23.900 --> 1:03:26.100
 having all different points of view

1:03:26.100 --> 1:03:27.740
 and all different religions

1:03:27.740 --> 1:03:30.500
 and all different ways of operating.

1:03:30.500 --> 1:03:35.500
 And I've come to treasure the fact that that is,

1:03:35.900 --> 1:03:37.980
 what's their business is their business.

1:03:37.980 --> 1:03:41.180
 And then the question is, where do you cross the line

1:03:41.180 --> 1:03:42.980
 under what circumstances

1:03:42.980 --> 1:03:45.740
 that others have got to do it my way.

1:03:45.740 --> 1:03:49.100
 And then when you do it internationally,

1:03:49.100 --> 1:03:52.900
 the issue of what is a sovereign state,

1:03:52.900 --> 1:03:56.020
 which as I say in the piece of Westphalia

1:03:56.020 --> 1:04:00.060
 and you have borders and then when do you cross the line

1:04:00.060 --> 1:04:02.700
 that my way of doing things

1:04:02.700 --> 1:04:04.460
 has got to be their way of doing things

1:04:04.460 --> 1:04:06.340
 or what are the various rights.

1:04:06.340 --> 1:04:09.500
 And so that's a very delicate question

1:04:09.500 --> 1:04:11.980
 or a very difficult question.

1:04:11.980 --> 1:04:16.220
 And we all have responsibilities to different parties

1:04:16.220 --> 1:04:18.940
 and we all have different levels of knowledge

1:04:18.940 --> 1:04:21.180
 about those particular things.

1:04:21.180 --> 1:04:25.580
 So for example, as an international investor,

1:04:25.580 --> 1:04:28.260
 I have a responsibility to my investors.

1:04:29.220 --> 1:04:33.060
 Those who run companies have a responsibility to theirs

1:04:33.060 --> 1:04:34.540
 of how do they run that.

1:04:34.540 --> 1:04:39.540
 So if you're taking Nike or Snickers and so on

1:04:39.820 --> 1:04:41.500
 and Americans can decide

1:04:41.500 --> 1:04:44.380
 whether they wanna buy Chinese products

1:04:44.380 --> 1:04:46.220
 or not buy Chinese products,

1:04:46.220 --> 1:04:49.420
 we are all faced with those types of choices.

1:04:49.420 --> 1:04:52.380
 So you have what do you wanna do in your constituency

1:04:52.380 --> 1:04:53.660
 and you have your choices.

1:04:53.660 --> 1:04:56.300
 And then beyond that, in many cases,

1:04:56.300 --> 1:04:58.060
 the issues are quite complex,

1:04:58.060 --> 1:05:02.300
 like there are geopolitical questions that enter into it.

1:05:02.300 --> 1:05:07.300
 So, and then I believe that if you disconnected,

1:05:08.700 --> 1:05:13.060
 if all those entities like myself,

1:05:13.060 --> 1:05:17.820
 the businesses doing business with China disconnected,

1:05:17.820 --> 1:05:20.420
 I think that that would be disastrous,

1:05:20.420 --> 1:05:22.340
 economically disastrous.

1:05:22.340 --> 1:05:27.340
 And it would also be reduce the understanding

1:05:27.540 --> 1:05:31.460
 that comes from working together that helps to reduce wars.

1:05:31.460 --> 1:05:33.740
 And so these are all complicated.

1:05:33.740 --> 1:05:38.700
 So what we do is, and who makes it my opinion

1:05:38.700 --> 1:05:39.620
 matters the most?

1:05:39.620 --> 1:05:41.740
 Why should it be my opinion that matters the most

1:05:41.740 --> 1:05:43.220
 in making that decision?

1:05:43.220 --> 1:05:46.740
 So I largely look at the government guidance

1:05:46.740 --> 1:05:49.300
 that I get not only from my own government,

1:05:49.300 --> 1:05:52.220
 but from the other governments and I follow the rules.

1:05:52.220 --> 1:05:55.380
 I'm in 40, we invest in 40 countries.

1:05:55.380 --> 1:05:57.580
 And we wanna do that in the best way

1:05:57.580 --> 1:05:59.980
 to provide the diversified portfolio.

1:05:59.980 --> 1:06:01.780
 And we sort of need that.

1:06:01.780 --> 1:06:06.380
 Every one of those countries has similar complexities.

1:06:06.380 --> 1:06:08.780
 There are always one issue or another,

1:06:08.780 --> 1:06:12.420
 and there's only so much that we really understand

1:06:12.420 --> 1:06:13.700
 about all of those issues.

1:06:13.700 --> 1:06:17.020
 So we rely largely on the guidance that we get.

1:06:17.020 --> 1:06:19.460
 Yeah, you have to empathize and show respect

1:06:19.460 --> 1:06:22.460
 to the culture of the place, the way things are done.

1:06:23.260 --> 1:06:25.020
 You don't necessarily,

1:06:26.740 --> 1:06:30.180
 the way you heal relationships between nations

1:06:30.180 --> 1:06:32.980
 is like you said, you work together.

1:06:32.980 --> 1:06:37.980
 And that requires kind of to listen

1:06:38.380 --> 1:06:40.220
 maybe more than you talk.

1:06:40.220 --> 1:06:42.540
 And I think people in the public sphere

1:06:44.140 --> 1:06:46.580
 talk a lot about China without really listening,

1:06:46.580 --> 1:06:48.300
 without understanding much about China,

1:06:48.300 --> 1:06:50.380
 though one of the things that makes me really sad

1:06:50.380 --> 1:06:52.340
 because I know how to speak Russian

1:06:53.700 --> 1:06:56.700
 and I know how much is lost in translation.

1:06:57.620 --> 1:07:00.220
 It makes me sad that I'll never really get to know

1:07:00.220 --> 1:07:02.940
 the Chinese culture because like,

1:07:02.940 --> 1:07:04.740
 I'll never really get to know the language,

1:07:04.740 --> 1:07:08.020
 the literature, just talk to regular people.

1:07:08.020 --> 1:07:10.580
 It's not just the government or officials or scientists,

1:07:10.580 --> 1:07:12.780
 just regular folks, get the culture.

1:07:12.780 --> 1:07:14.980
 I think if you don't understand the culture,

1:07:14.980 --> 1:07:18.740
 just the basics of the human nature,

1:07:18.740 --> 1:07:21.860
 what people love about their country,

1:07:21.860 --> 1:07:25.340
 about their family or the kind of hopes they have,

1:07:25.340 --> 1:07:26.540
 what kind of values they have,

1:07:26.540 --> 1:07:28.700
 without that you're not gonna be able to

1:07:30.740 --> 1:07:34.060
 fully connect with them.

1:07:34.060 --> 1:07:35.940
 And you have to do that first

1:07:35.940 --> 1:07:37.940
 to have a chance of building a good world.

1:07:37.940 --> 1:07:39.100
 I couldn't agree with you more.

1:07:39.100 --> 1:07:41.780
 I was very lucky because as I say,

1:07:41.780 --> 1:07:46.780
 since 1984, so for more than half of my life,

1:07:47.820 --> 1:07:51.020
 I've been going there and the common people

1:07:51.020 --> 1:07:53.820
 and all sorts of people, and I've got to meet them.

1:07:53.820 --> 1:07:56.220
 I don't speak the language,

1:07:56.220 --> 1:07:59.820
 but a combination of through translators

1:07:59.820 --> 1:08:02.940
 or them speaking English and being in situations.

1:08:02.940 --> 1:08:07.380
 I had my son go to school, a local school,

1:08:07.380 --> 1:08:10.780
 and we developed those kinds of understandings.

1:08:10.780 --> 1:08:15.780
 I think that, but the not wanting

1:08:16.500 --> 1:08:18.820
 to know the other perspective

1:08:20.020 --> 1:08:22.060
 is the thing that's most scary.

1:08:22.060 --> 1:08:24.220
 Like I'm right now in the middle

1:08:24.220 --> 1:08:27.820
 and all I want to try to do

1:08:27.820 --> 1:08:31.740
 is to help mutual understanding.

1:08:31.740 --> 1:08:34.700
 You're right, if there were questions probing me,

1:08:34.700 --> 1:08:36.780
 asking me, what is it?

1:08:36.780 --> 1:08:39.420
 I'm not on one side or another.

1:08:39.420 --> 1:08:41.860
 I don't want to be on one side or another.

1:08:41.860 --> 1:08:44.620
 I believe that each has their right within there

1:08:44.620 --> 1:08:46.980
 to approach their different culture in their own way.

1:08:46.980 --> 1:08:48.900
 So many ways you gave an example.

1:08:50.220 --> 1:08:54.740
 If they're not doing harm to others, I mean,

1:08:54.740 --> 1:08:59.740
 but that issue of trying to understand

1:09:01.340 --> 1:09:03.220
 is so much better.

1:09:03.220 --> 1:09:05.260
 That doesn't mean agree with.

1:09:05.260 --> 1:09:10.260
 If you are wanting to out clever

1:09:11.020 --> 1:09:12.940
 and out compete somebody,

1:09:12.940 --> 1:09:16.980
 it still pays to understand what they're thinking.

1:09:16.980 --> 1:09:20.460
 So to achieve understanding of what they're thinking,

1:09:20.460 --> 1:09:22.180
 even if you want to go to war with them,

1:09:22.180 --> 1:09:25.260
 that understanding is the best thing to have.

1:09:25.260 --> 1:09:28.100
 What we have now is a situation

1:09:28.100 --> 1:09:31.580
 in which there's an enemy mentality.

1:09:31.580 --> 1:09:35.420
 And that means that anything that serves,

1:09:35.420 --> 1:09:39.740
 seems to be like understanding or conveying understanding,

1:09:39.740 --> 1:09:42.540
 seems to mistakenly create the notion

1:09:42.540 --> 1:09:45.340
 of I'm on their side in a war.

1:09:45.340 --> 1:09:47.700
 And that's kind of a dangerous thing

1:09:47.700 --> 1:09:50.860
 because there's a momentum here to fight.

1:09:51.900 --> 1:09:54.620
 Henry Kissinger praises your new book

1:09:54.620 --> 1:09:57.620
 and you thank him in it in the dedication.

1:09:57.620 --> 1:09:59.660
 What's your relationship like with him?

1:09:59.660 --> 1:10:01.540
 What makes him interesting?

1:10:01.540 --> 1:10:03.220
 Maybe what makes him controversial?

1:10:03.220 --> 1:10:05.740
 What makes him such a central figure in history?

1:10:05.740 --> 1:10:10.140
 First, most importantly, he's unique about seeing things

1:10:10.140 --> 1:10:13.580
 through all the others eyes.

1:10:14.660 --> 1:10:18.020
 So if you were, it's like there's a chess game.

1:10:18.020 --> 1:10:22.900
 I mean, I think geopolitics is like a chess game,

1:10:22.900 --> 1:10:26.620
 but with multiple chess players playing the same game.

1:10:26.620 --> 1:10:30.060
 So imagine there are six people around

1:10:30.060 --> 1:10:34.700
 playing the chess game and he could sit in each seat

1:10:34.700 --> 1:10:38.500
 and he could know how they see it, okay?

1:10:38.500 --> 1:10:42.300
 And see it in a calm way of how they see it.

1:10:42.300 --> 1:10:43.740
 He's unique in that way.

1:10:43.740 --> 1:10:48.060
 He's 98 years old and he's equally able to do that.

1:10:48.060 --> 1:10:52.500
 And he has a background in which he's a historian.

1:10:52.500 --> 1:10:57.260
 So he really understands history super terrifically.

1:10:58.860 --> 1:11:02.100
 He doesn't understand economic history as much.

1:11:02.100 --> 1:11:06.340
 So that's why to some extent we enjoy having a conversation

1:11:06.340 --> 1:11:10.260
 because he's interested in the economic piece he doesn't know

1:11:10.260 --> 1:11:13.540
 and I'm so interested in the geopolitical piece

1:11:13.540 --> 1:11:15.060
 that I don't know as well.

1:11:15.060 --> 1:11:16.940
 But anyway, he's able to do that,

1:11:16.940 --> 1:11:21.500
 but not only a historian, but a practitioner.

1:11:21.500 --> 1:11:26.500
 So when you go from an academic to a practitioner

1:11:27.780 --> 1:11:31.860
 who has that talent to see things through others eyes

1:11:31.860 --> 1:11:35.220
 in an objective way and to be strategic

1:11:35.220 --> 1:11:38.940
 rather than just tactical, that's a very special person

1:11:38.940 --> 1:11:43.020
 and that's why Henry is, to me, a very special person.

1:11:43.020 --> 1:11:45.380
 Yeah, he's lived a fascinating life.

1:11:45.380 --> 1:11:49.820
 Just all of the world events he's been involved in

1:11:49.820 --> 1:11:51.780
 is fascinating and like you said,

1:11:51.780 --> 1:11:54.460
 that's such an interesting skill to have

1:11:54.460 --> 1:11:57.260
 to consider what are the concerns, the hope, the dreams,

1:11:57.260 --> 1:11:59.540
 the fears of all the people at the table.

1:11:59.540 --> 1:12:01.240
 What are they thinking?

1:12:01.240 --> 1:12:05.660
 I find that people don't, once again, don't do that enough

1:12:05.660 --> 1:12:07.660
 when it's the obvious thing you should be doing,

1:12:07.660 --> 1:12:12.660
 whether it's business deals or political negotiation

1:12:13.180 --> 1:12:15.380
 or geopolitical negotiation.

1:12:15.380 --> 1:12:18.060
 I'm often surprised, again, sorry to go to the Russian thing

1:12:18.060 --> 1:12:23.060
 because I hear Putin talk in Russian

1:12:23.860 --> 1:12:26.260
 and you start to infer certain intentions,

1:12:26.260 --> 1:12:30.140
 like not the trivial stuff, like the human being.

1:12:30.140 --> 1:12:33.020
 What is that human being hoping for himself,

1:12:33.020 --> 1:12:36.100
 for his country, for his close inner circle,

1:12:36.100 --> 1:12:39.460
 for the bigger, and I just see that

1:12:39.460 --> 1:12:41.460
 that's often just lost in translation.

1:12:41.460 --> 1:12:45.460
 I just see American leaders talking to Putin

1:12:45.460 --> 1:12:48.820
 and it's just not, there's not a connection.

1:12:48.820 --> 1:12:51.980
 Absolutely, I know exactly what you're talking about.

1:12:53.580 --> 1:12:58.580
 It has never failed that in my listening to a conversation

1:12:58.580 --> 1:13:03.580
 or even reading a speech and you see then it reported,

1:13:05.620 --> 1:13:10.620
 inevitably, the reporter picks some headline characterization

1:13:10.620 --> 1:13:15.620
 that has very little to do with what was really happening

1:13:16.380 --> 1:13:19.100
 but might be a headline grabber

1:13:19.100 --> 1:13:20.980
 that's at some kind of distortion

1:13:20.980 --> 1:13:22.860
 and there's a lack of understanding

1:13:22.860 --> 1:13:25.180
 of really what's going on.

1:13:25.180 --> 1:13:27.540
 If it's okay, let me ask you a couple questions

1:13:27.540 --> 1:13:28.840
 about cryptocurrency.

1:13:29.900 --> 1:13:32.700
 You've had a few opinions about Bitcoin over the years.

1:13:32.700 --> 1:13:34.900
 What are your thoughts about Bitcoin today,

1:13:34.900 --> 1:13:38.380
 its role in the global financial system

1:13:38.380 --> 1:13:41.420
 and just in human society in general?

1:13:41.420 --> 1:13:44.340
 Well, the evolution of Bitcoin over the years

1:13:44.340 --> 1:13:49.340
 is one of the things that has influenced changes in my view.

1:13:51.660 --> 1:13:56.660
 It has proven itself something like 10, 11 years ago.

1:13:57.460 --> 1:14:01.260
 Imagine the programming of this and you throw it out

1:14:01.260 --> 1:14:02.800
 and that's the idea.

1:14:02.800 --> 1:14:04.820
 It has not been hacked.

1:14:04.820 --> 1:14:09.660
 It has operated, it has built,

1:14:09.660 --> 1:14:14.380
 it has come an amazing way over that 11 years

1:14:14.380 --> 1:14:19.380
 to be maybe probably the most excited topic

1:14:19.860 --> 1:14:23.700
 among a lot of people and has been used

1:14:23.700 --> 1:14:28.700
 and is now has obtained the status of having imputed value.

1:14:28.700 --> 1:14:32.880
 At the same time, it is one of those assets

1:14:32.880 --> 1:14:35.080
 that is an alternative money.

1:14:35.080 --> 1:14:37.640
 I think we're entering an era

1:14:37.640 --> 1:14:42.080
 where there's going to be a competition of monies.

1:14:43.440 --> 1:14:46.520
 Because of the printing of fiat money

1:14:47.480 --> 1:14:50.560
 and the depreciated value,

1:14:50.560 --> 1:14:53.080
 there will be a competition of monies

1:14:54.040 --> 1:14:57.520
 and Bitcoin is part of that competition.

1:14:57.520 --> 1:15:00.880
 But there'll be many monies, not just crypto monies,

1:15:00.880 --> 1:15:03.560
 but there'll be central bank crypto monies,

1:15:04.560 --> 1:15:07.240
 but there'll be different kinds of monies.

1:15:08.240 --> 1:15:12.760
 And even monies are things that you buy and sell.

1:15:12.760 --> 1:15:16.720
 NFTs can become a type of money.

1:15:16.720 --> 1:15:18.360
 You own it and it's an investment

1:15:18.360 --> 1:15:22.560
 and you could say I'd rather own it than own Bitcoin.

1:15:22.560 --> 1:15:25.240
 Has Ray Dalio bought any NFTs?

1:15:25.240 --> 1:15:26.080
 Not yet.

1:15:26.080 --> 1:15:31.080
 But only just because I definitely want to buy NFTs

1:15:35.040 --> 1:15:36.920
 to just experience them.

1:15:36.920 --> 1:15:40.680
 Like I think I should produce one and I should.

1:15:40.680 --> 1:15:41.520
 I should have asked that.

1:15:41.520 --> 1:15:43.800
 Have you minted an NFT?

1:15:43.800 --> 1:15:45.720
 You probably should just to know what it's like.

1:15:45.720 --> 1:15:46.600
 Yeah, that's right.

1:15:46.600 --> 1:15:48.200
 This stuff is happening.

1:15:48.200 --> 1:15:51.920
 This stuff is real and how it operates.

1:15:51.920 --> 1:15:56.920
 But like all new real things, some are gonna go

1:15:57.320 --> 1:16:00.100
 and some are gonna, it's like in the internet

1:16:00.100 --> 1:16:05.100
 in the year 2000, pets.com could have been a great,

1:16:05.320 --> 1:16:08.280
 but maybe pets.com doesn't make it and who knows.

1:16:08.280 --> 1:16:10.960
 That's the beauty of the competitive system

1:16:10.960 --> 1:16:13.280
 that it'll evolve and some things will be treasured

1:16:13.280 --> 1:16:15.400
 and some things will be trashed.

1:16:17.520 --> 1:16:21.780
 But when I look at it, I think we are in an environment

1:16:21.780 --> 1:16:23.840
 of what is an alternative money?

1:16:23.840 --> 1:16:27.000
 A money has two purposes, a medium of exchange

1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:29.160
 and a storehold of wealth.

1:16:29.160 --> 1:16:33.720
 And we are looking for, and it's portable.

1:16:33.720 --> 1:16:38.020
 And it's best if it's recognized in other countries.

1:16:39.080 --> 1:16:41.840
 So gold is one of those.

1:16:41.840 --> 1:16:46.560
 So I look at it as an alternative gold,

1:16:46.560 --> 1:16:49.640
 but I look at a number of things as alternative gold.

1:16:49.640 --> 1:16:54.640
 And I think that, and gold is still my favorite

1:16:54.840 --> 1:16:56.920
 because of certain qualities.

1:16:56.920 --> 1:16:59.520
 For example, you can't trace it.

1:16:59.520 --> 1:17:02.400
 In Bitcoin, you can trace who owns it,

1:17:02.400 --> 1:17:04.080
 where it's going and so on.

1:17:04.080 --> 1:17:07.460
 Governments can't have that ability to trace it and so on.

1:17:07.460 --> 1:17:10.800
 A gold piece of coin, it's not connected.

1:17:10.800 --> 1:17:13.000
 I think not connected has benefits,

1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:16.280
 particularly in a world where maybe connections

1:17:16.280 --> 1:17:17.660
 can be more risky.

1:17:17.660 --> 1:17:22.660
 And then also gold has been for many thousands of years

1:17:25.100 --> 1:17:28.420
 universally recognized as a source of money.

1:17:28.420 --> 1:17:33.380
 And central banks, it's the third largest source of money

1:17:33.380 --> 1:17:35.500
 in central bank reserves.

1:17:35.500 --> 1:17:38.360
 And I don't think Bitcoin is going to serve

1:17:38.360 --> 1:17:40.420
 those types of purposes and so on.

1:17:40.420 --> 1:17:44.060
 So for various reasons, I prefer gold to the other,

1:17:44.060 --> 1:17:46.940
 but it's a little bit part of my mix.

1:17:46.940 --> 1:17:50.420
 But then you look at it, it hit, I think 69,000 this year

1:17:50.420 --> 1:17:52.780
 is the high Bitcoin hit.

1:17:52.780 --> 1:17:55.640
 Do you think it's possible, you mentioned gold,

1:17:55.640 --> 1:17:59.260
 do you think it's possible it reaches very high numbers,

1:17:59.260 --> 1:18:02.380
 like one million that some people talk about?

1:18:02.380 --> 1:18:06.020
 I don't think that's possible because the way I look at it

1:18:06.020 --> 1:18:11.020
 is there's a certain amount of it.

1:18:11.020 --> 1:18:16.020
 A certain amount of it, and there's a certain amount of gold.

1:18:18.060 --> 1:18:19.800
 I'll use gold as a benchmark.

1:18:21.340 --> 1:18:26.340
 The amount of it is worth about $1 trillion.

1:18:26.780 --> 1:18:29.740
 Total crypto is about 2.2 trillion.

1:18:29.740 --> 1:18:33.700
 But let's say Bitcoin, it's $1 trillion.

1:18:33.700 --> 1:18:37.740
 If you take the amount of money that is in gold

1:18:37.740 --> 1:18:42.380
 that is not used for jewelry purposes

1:18:42.380 --> 1:18:45.020
 and not used by central banks,

1:18:45.020 --> 1:18:48.380
 and I assume Bitcoin won't be used for jewelry purposes

1:18:48.380 --> 1:18:50.140
 or central bank purposes,

1:18:51.260 --> 1:18:54.220
 that amount in gold is about $5 trillion.

1:18:55.120 --> 1:18:59.160
 So right now, if you were to have a portfolio

1:18:59.160 --> 1:19:03.980
 that has gold and crypto, gold and Bitcoin,

1:19:03.980 --> 1:19:07.540
 it's worth about 20% of the value of gold.

1:19:07.540 --> 1:19:12.540
 Do I think it's going to be worth more than gold

1:19:12.580 --> 1:19:14.220
 in terms of that mix?

1:19:14.220 --> 1:19:16.900
 I don't think it'll be worth more than gold.

1:19:16.900 --> 1:19:21.340
 But let's say it became worth as much as gold.

1:19:21.340 --> 1:19:22.740
 I don't believe it will be.

1:19:22.740 --> 1:19:25.660
 I think that 20% sounds kind of about right.

1:19:25.660 --> 1:19:28.000
 I really don't know what the right answer is.

1:19:29.100 --> 1:19:32.780
 And then there's the question of what is all of that pool

1:19:32.780 --> 1:19:36.220
 of money that let's say gold and gold equivalents

1:19:36.220 --> 1:19:37.600
 relative to everything else?

1:19:37.600 --> 1:19:41.100
 Does it go from, let's call it

1:19:41.940 --> 1:19:44.740
 six, seven, eight trillion to 16 trillion?

1:19:44.740 --> 1:19:46.140
 Maybe it could double.

1:19:46.140 --> 1:19:48.740
 It depends what it is in the world environment.

1:19:48.740 --> 1:19:51.760
 But basically, if you use gold as a measure,

1:19:54.220 --> 1:19:56.260
 it just makes no sense

1:19:56.260 --> 1:20:00.440
 that it's going to be used that much more.

1:20:00.440 --> 1:20:01.760
 Am I sure about that?

1:20:01.760 --> 1:20:03.340
 I'm not sure about anything.

1:20:03.340 --> 1:20:07.900
 But logically, it seems to me that there's a limitation

1:20:07.900 --> 1:20:11.300
 on its price in relationship to other things

1:20:11.300 --> 1:20:12.260
 that are like it.

1:20:13.340 --> 1:20:15.820
 Let me ask for your deep financial analysis

1:20:15.820 --> 1:20:17.500
 on a very important issue.

1:20:17.500 --> 1:20:20.380
 I just talked a couple days ago with Elon Musk.

1:20:20.380 --> 1:20:23.700
 He wants to put a literal Dogecoin on the moon.

1:20:23.700 --> 1:20:25.760
 What are your thoughts about Dogecoin?

1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:30.940
 And do you think it'll be the official currency?

1:20:30.940 --> 1:20:35.140
 How many be reserve currency on the moon and on Mars?

1:20:35.140 --> 1:20:37.540
 My reaction is that's cute.

1:20:37.540 --> 1:20:40.300
 I remember Elon when he first got,

1:20:40.300 --> 1:20:42.520
 he first got his money from PayPal.

1:20:42.520 --> 1:20:45.460
 I think he said to me it was,

1:20:45.460 --> 1:20:48.140
 he got $180 million, $90 million.

1:20:48.140 --> 1:20:52.460
 He decided to say, why aren't we going to outer space?

1:20:52.460 --> 1:20:57.460
 And he wanted to take a spaceship that would be modified

1:20:57.460 --> 1:21:02.460
 using Russian technology to put a plant

1:21:05.820 --> 1:21:10.820
 and a watering can on the moon or on Mars, I think it was.

1:21:14.780 --> 1:21:17.660
 And he said, first life on Mars,

1:21:17.660 --> 1:21:22.660
 or first life on that as an inspiring notion.

1:21:23.820 --> 1:21:27.300
 And so then there's always what's behind it.

1:21:27.300 --> 1:21:31.380
 I have a lot of respect for Elon's ability

1:21:31.380 --> 1:21:34.220
 to do other things behind it.

1:21:34.220 --> 1:21:38.020
 And so I would take that as symbolic

1:21:38.020 --> 1:21:41.420
 and I'd be asking him what's behind it, what's next.

1:21:41.420 --> 1:21:44.820
 And I'm also just on the topic of Dogecoin and memecoin

1:21:44.820 --> 1:21:48.420
 and there's some aspect of humor and lightheartedness

1:21:48.420 --> 1:21:52.380
 that's really interesting about the way we communicate,

1:21:52.380 --> 1:21:54.100
 what ideas become viral,

1:21:54.100 --> 1:21:57.940
 how to captivate people with ideas.

1:21:57.940 --> 1:22:00.060
 There's something about taking things too seriously

1:22:00.060 --> 1:22:02.820
 that somehow slows it all down and it's interesting.

1:22:02.820 --> 1:22:03.700
 You're right.

1:22:03.700 --> 1:22:05.300
 That's part of human nature somehow.

1:22:05.300 --> 1:22:07.720
 So like humor is part of this whole thing.

1:22:09.900 --> 1:22:13.500
 You've talked about the importance of writing ideas down

1:22:14.340 --> 1:22:15.660
 and you have a fascinating.

1:22:15.660 --> 1:22:17.260
 Principles in particular.

1:22:17.260 --> 1:22:18.340
 Principles.

1:22:18.340 --> 1:22:20.920
 And you have this really nice thing in your book

1:22:20.920 --> 1:22:24.580
 where you actually, I mean there's such a brilliant way.

1:22:26.140 --> 1:22:28.980
 You have such a brilliant way of highlighting

1:22:28.980 --> 1:22:33.500
 which parts are extra important and you make them bold.

1:22:33.500 --> 1:22:34.700
 That's a brilliant idea.

1:22:34.700 --> 1:22:36.380
 But let me just ask the high level question

1:22:36.380 --> 1:22:41.380
 of what's a good system for taking notes?

1:22:42.060 --> 1:22:45.560
 Well, I find that almost everything happens

1:22:45.560 --> 1:22:46.800
 over and over again.

1:22:46.800 --> 1:22:51.800
 And we're in the blizzard of these things happening.

1:22:52.400 --> 1:22:56.760
 And what I found is that if I'm making a decision

1:22:58.280 --> 1:23:02.160
 that after I make the decision usually

1:23:02.160 --> 1:23:03.600
 or write at the time,

1:23:03.600 --> 1:23:08.600
 if I pause and reflect and I write my principle down,

1:23:08.840 --> 1:23:12.300
 in other words, principle is sort of a recipe,

1:23:12.300 --> 1:23:16.560
 what would I use to, how would I make that decision?

1:23:16.560 --> 1:23:18.560
 And what are the criteria around it?

1:23:18.560 --> 1:23:23.200
 I find that I make it much more clear, it becomes clearer

1:23:23.200 --> 1:23:26.480
 and it applies to the next thing that comes along,

1:23:26.480 --> 1:23:28.040
 it'll be that way.

1:23:28.040 --> 1:23:30.880
 Because everything happens over and over and over again

1:23:30.880 --> 1:23:33.200
 and I think people make the mistake

1:23:33.200 --> 1:23:37.080
 of looking at just the one like it's the first one.

1:23:37.080 --> 1:23:40.120
 I don't know, they have the first problem of this sort

1:23:40.120 --> 1:23:42.160
 or the first child or whatever it is.

1:23:42.160 --> 1:23:44.680
 And this has been happening plenty of times.

1:23:44.680 --> 1:23:46.600
 And so if you have the principles,

1:23:46.600 --> 1:23:50.640
 I found that that helped me think more clearly about it

1:23:50.640 --> 1:23:54.400
 and it helped me communicate better, like why.

1:23:54.400 --> 1:23:58.900
 And so over the years, over the last 30 years or so,

1:23:58.900 --> 1:24:00.140
 that's what I've done.

1:24:00.140 --> 1:24:02.740
 I did it originally to communicate very well

1:24:02.740 --> 1:24:04.880
 with the people I work with.

1:24:04.880 --> 1:24:07.880
 I set up my company and it was very important

1:24:07.880 --> 1:24:09.040
 to have good communication.

1:24:09.040 --> 1:24:11.520
 And then we could debate the principles

1:24:11.520 --> 1:24:14.000
 and so that's the process.

1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:16.680
 I urge people to do that.

1:24:16.680 --> 1:24:19.160
 There are many excellent decision makers

1:24:20.080 --> 1:24:23.460
 and I just wish that they wrote down their principles.

1:24:23.460 --> 1:24:27.580
 When this set, so for example,

1:24:27.580 --> 1:24:30.580
 we talk about Henry Kissinger and his new book

1:24:30.580 --> 1:24:32.840
 is gonna come out with a book on leadership.

1:24:33.840 --> 1:24:37.000
 And don't just describe the leaders,

1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:41.140
 describe then what about them were the essential elements

1:24:41.140 --> 1:24:44.440
 to make a good leader under what circumstances.

1:24:44.440 --> 1:24:47.000
 And so if we think about that,

1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:51.720
 then also then you begin to think in a principled way.

1:24:51.720 --> 1:24:55.200
 And then when you start to think in a principled way,

1:24:55.200 --> 1:24:58.760
 life becomes, it's so much easier to make decisions

1:24:58.760 --> 1:25:01.040
 and it's so much less confusing

1:25:01.040 --> 1:25:04.120
 because it's like coming up on a species

1:25:04.120 --> 1:25:08.020
 and you say, okay, well, what species is it?

1:25:08.020 --> 1:25:10.600
 Not just another, it's a thing.

1:25:10.600 --> 1:25:12.360
 No, what species is it

1:25:12.360 --> 1:25:15.880
 and how do I deal with that species effectively?

1:25:15.880 --> 1:25:17.800
 And so that's what that is.

1:25:17.800 --> 1:25:20.300
 And so I encourage people to write it down.

1:25:20.300 --> 1:25:24.240
 I wish anybody who's successful wrote down their principles

1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:27.440
 or their recipes for making those types of decisions.

1:25:27.440 --> 1:25:30.720
 So the events of interest here happens

1:25:30.720 --> 1:25:33.520
 over and over and over in similar ways.

1:25:33.520 --> 1:25:34.920
 As you're looking for the patterns

1:25:34.920 --> 1:25:36.720
 and you're defining the process,

1:25:37.640 --> 1:25:40.400
 that's right to respond to those patterns

1:25:40.400 --> 1:25:42.920
 and you call that the principles

1:25:42.920 --> 1:25:46.480
 and that allows you to deal with the future effectively.

1:25:46.480 --> 1:25:49.800
 So like that codifies the lessons from the past

1:25:49.800 --> 1:25:51.740
 to be able to deal with the future.

1:25:52.900 --> 1:25:55.520
 What advice do you have for young folks today?

1:25:55.520 --> 1:25:59.020
 In high school, in college, thinking about how to live,

1:26:00.260 --> 1:26:02.480
 have a career they can be proud of

1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:05.320
 or maybe have a life they can be proud of?

1:26:05.320 --> 1:26:09.320
 Know yourself, follow your passion,

1:26:09.320 --> 1:26:12.640
 make your work and passion the same thing

1:26:12.640 --> 1:26:15.280
 while considering the money part

1:26:15.280 --> 1:26:18.400
 because money will get you freedom and choice

1:26:18.400 --> 1:26:19.480
 and be able to bank that.

1:26:19.480 --> 1:26:24.160
 But if you know yourself, feel the pull

1:26:27.120 --> 1:26:28.580
 and pursue that passion.

1:26:29.880 --> 1:26:32.000
 And along those lines, by the way,

1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:36.720
 I found that using personality profile tests

1:26:36.720 --> 1:26:38.180
 has been very helpful.

1:26:38.180 --> 1:26:40.560
 I've used those for about 25 years

1:26:40.560 --> 1:26:42.940
 for people to help to understand themselves

1:26:42.940 --> 1:26:43.920
 and understand each other.

1:26:43.920 --> 1:26:48.920
 So I created a free one that is called Principles You.

1:26:49.180 --> 1:26:50.320
 It's online.

1:26:51.220 --> 1:26:56.220
 It's had remarkable, loving people who've taken it,

1:26:57.360 --> 1:26:58.440
 learn about themselves,

1:26:58.440 --> 1:27:01.240
 but also you can put in somebody else

1:27:01.240 --> 1:27:04.120
 and it'll tell you about your relationship with them.

1:27:04.120 --> 1:27:06.820
 That's like 30 minutes is a quick discovery,

1:27:06.820 --> 1:27:10.760
 but the main thing is to understand on your journey,

1:27:10.760 --> 1:27:15.760
 your hero's journey that you will have mistakes

1:27:17.160 --> 1:27:19.320
 and you will have weaknesses

1:27:19.320 --> 1:27:24.320
 and to understand those, not fight those

1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:28.560
 because by understanding mistakes,

1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:31.080
 you will learn not to make mistakes again.

1:27:31.080 --> 1:27:35.400
 I have a principle which is pain plus reflection

1:27:35.400 --> 1:27:37.320
 equals progress.

1:27:37.320 --> 1:27:41.240
 And so that reflection is important to know yourself,

1:27:41.240 --> 1:27:44.360
 know your pulls, know your weaknesses.

1:27:44.360 --> 1:27:46.920
 And when you also know your weaknesses

1:27:46.920 --> 1:27:48.940
 and the strengths of other people,

1:27:48.940 --> 1:27:52.480
 there are people who have strengths where you're weak

1:27:52.480 --> 1:27:54.440
 and you have strengths where they're weak.

1:27:54.440 --> 1:27:57.240
 And to be able to work well together

1:27:57.240 --> 1:28:02.240
 is the most effective way of achieving success.

1:28:02.440 --> 1:28:05.000
 So yeah, it's that journey.

1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:08.320
 And there's a life arc and there's a journey

1:28:08.320 --> 1:28:11.360
 and you wanna make it the best that you can make it.

1:28:11.360 --> 1:28:15.280
 And it's like a video game.

1:28:15.280 --> 1:28:19.500
 It has the challenges and the obstacles

1:28:19.500 --> 1:28:22.920
 and the learning experiences and the temptations

1:28:22.920 --> 1:28:24.040
 and all of that.

1:28:24.040 --> 1:28:28.180
 And the maximizing learning to go where you wanna go

1:28:28.180 --> 1:28:31.560
 to achieve the life you want is the most important.

1:28:31.560 --> 1:28:34.320
 That's kind of maybe a long winded way of saying it,

1:28:34.320 --> 1:28:39.320
 but to learn, I think I'll try to say it simply.

1:28:39.400 --> 1:28:41.360
 There's a five step process.

1:28:41.360 --> 1:28:46.360
 Step one is know your goals, know what you're going after.

1:28:48.400 --> 1:28:50.280
 You could have almost anything you want,

1:28:50.280 --> 1:28:52.400
 but you can't have everything you want.

1:28:52.400 --> 1:28:56.120
 And so you have to prioritize and you move in that direction.

1:28:56.120 --> 1:28:57.360
 On the way to your goals,

1:28:57.360 --> 1:29:01.100
 you're going to encounter your problems and your obstacles.

1:29:01.100 --> 1:29:05.680
 So step two is understanding your problems

1:29:05.680 --> 1:29:07.720
 and your obstacles, identify them.

1:29:07.720 --> 1:29:10.740
 Step three is to diagnose them

1:29:10.740 --> 1:29:13.900
 to get at the root cause of the problem.

1:29:13.900 --> 1:29:16.560
 And that could be many root causes,

1:29:16.560 --> 1:29:19.720
 but it could also be your weaknesses or weaknesses of others,

1:29:19.720 --> 1:29:22.160
 but you have to be objective about them.

1:29:22.160 --> 1:29:26.080
 Once you diagnose them, then you go to step four,

1:29:26.080 --> 1:29:29.200
 which is to design a way to get around them.

1:29:29.200 --> 1:29:33.940
 And then after you have that design,

1:29:33.940 --> 1:29:35.720
 you implement that design.

1:29:35.720 --> 1:29:38.200
 So you have to follow through and do it.

1:29:38.200 --> 1:29:42.920
 And you do that, and that will then produce its new results,

1:29:42.920 --> 1:29:44.780
 which should be better results.

1:29:44.780 --> 1:29:47.680
 I call this kind of a looping process.

1:29:47.680 --> 1:29:50.240
 It's the evolutionary looping process.

1:29:50.240 --> 1:29:53.380
 And you just keep doing that

1:29:53.380 --> 1:29:55.140
 and you learn over a period of time

1:29:55.140 --> 1:29:57.660
 and you move in the direction that you want.

1:29:57.660 --> 1:30:01.260
 Last question, and you only have one minute to answer.

1:30:02.680 --> 1:30:05.040
 You dedicate the book, quote,

1:30:05.040 --> 1:30:08.660
 "'To my grandchildren and those of their generation

1:30:08.660 --> 1:30:09.840
 "'who will be participants

1:30:09.840 --> 1:30:12.880
 "'in the continuation of this story.

1:30:12.880 --> 1:30:15.760
 "'May the force of evolution be with you.'"

1:30:15.760 --> 1:30:18.480
 So let me ask, where's this force of evolution

1:30:18.480 --> 1:30:20.520
 taking human civilization?

1:30:20.520 --> 1:30:24.720
 And what in this story that evolution is writing

1:30:24.720 --> 1:30:26.560
 gives you hope?

1:30:26.560 --> 1:30:30.640
 Evolution is a direction toward improvement.

1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:37.000
 And the greatest force is man's capacity to adapt and invent.

1:30:40.280 --> 1:30:42.960
 And so you see in the charts in the book,

1:30:42.960 --> 1:30:47.960
 you see that this upward movement, life expectancy,

1:30:51.160 --> 1:30:55.200
 health, all the things that we think are better,

1:30:55.200 --> 1:30:57.120
 you see there's a chart

1:30:57.120 --> 1:30:59.280
 and it shows that over a period of time

1:30:59.280 --> 1:31:02.960
 and you barely see the downturns

1:31:02.960 --> 1:31:05.980
 from depressions and wars in that.

1:31:05.980 --> 1:31:08.080
 That is the greatest power.

1:31:08.080 --> 1:31:13.080
 Man's ability to invent and adapt is evolution

1:31:13.280 --> 1:31:15.400
 and that's the greatest power

1:31:15.400 --> 1:31:20.040
 and that is what gives me justifiable hope.

1:31:20.040 --> 1:31:23.160
 And a continuation of that, like we mentioned with Elon,

1:31:23.160 --> 1:31:25.720
 maybe we'll become a multi planetary species.

1:31:25.720 --> 1:31:28.600
 So not only will we keep creating amazing things

1:31:28.600 --> 1:31:31.840
 here on Earth, we'll keep expanding out into the cosmos.

1:31:31.840 --> 1:31:36.600
 My time horizon isn't gonna have me analyzing that yet,

1:31:36.600 --> 1:31:41.600
 but I hope so and I agree that that would be

1:31:41.720 --> 1:31:42.560
 in the next.

1:31:42.560 --> 1:31:43.400
 So I'm not gonna ask you

1:31:43.400 --> 1:31:46.160
 for the best financial system on Mars.

1:31:46.160 --> 1:31:47.960
 I think we'll focus on Earth for now.

1:31:47.960 --> 1:31:49.720
 Ray, thank you so much for your brilliance,

1:31:49.720 --> 1:31:51.240
 for the books you've written,

1:31:51.240 --> 1:31:52.160
 for the works you've done,

1:31:52.160 --> 1:31:54.560
 for the inspiration of millions.

1:31:54.560 --> 1:31:57.360
 And thank you for spending your valuable time

1:31:57.360 --> 1:31:58.440
 here with me today.

1:31:58.440 --> 1:31:59.960
 Thank you.

1:31:59.960 --> 1:32:02.720
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ray Dalio.

 And now, let me leave you with some words

1:32:08.960 --> 1:32:11.360
 from Ray Dalio himself.

1:32:11.360 --> 1:32:13.960
 Every time you confront something painful,

1:32:13.960 --> 1:32:17.160
 you are at a potentially important juncture in your life.

1:32:17.160 --> 1:32:19.320
 You have the opportunity to choose healthy

1:32:19.320 --> 1:32:24.320
 and painful truth or unhealthy but comfortable delusion.

1:32:24.320 --> 1:32:51.320
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
