00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
 The following is a conversation with Jimmy Pedro,

00:02.720 --> 00:05.160
 a legendary judo competitor and coach.

00:05.160 --> 00:08.580
 He represented the United States at four Olympics

00:08.580 --> 00:12.140
 in 92, 96, 2000, and 2004,

00:12.140 --> 00:14.680
 winning a bronze medal at two of them.

00:14.680 --> 00:17.480
 He medaled in three world championships,

00:17.480 --> 00:20.080
 winning gold in 1999.

00:20.080 --> 00:23.640
 He has coached many of the elite level American judoka,

00:23.640 --> 00:26.100
 including Kayla Harrison, Ronda Rousey,

00:26.100 --> 00:28.460
 Travis Stevens, and many others.

00:28.460 --> 00:32.880
 Plus, he's now my judo coach, along with Travis Stevens.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.920
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.920
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:36.920 --> 00:38.320
 in the description.

00:38.320 --> 00:42.240
 And now, here's my conversation with Jimmy Pedro.

00:43.160 --> 00:46.600
 What is the most beautiful throw in judo to you?

00:47.720 --> 00:49.320
 I think Uchi Mata.

00:49.320 --> 00:51.080
 You know, it's the one that seems

00:51.080 --> 00:52.560
 to have the most amplitude.

00:52.560 --> 00:54.440
 That person goes the highest,

00:54.440 --> 00:57.220
 you see a leg swing through the middle,

00:57.220 --> 00:59.160
 the person doing the throw, there's a leg swinging

00:59.160 --> 01:01.520
 through the middle, the other person definitely goes,

01:01.520 --> 01:04.720
 you know, head over heels, flat on their back.

01:04.720 --> 01:08.120
 It's probably the most dynamic, pretty judo throw there is.

01:08.120 --> 01:11.120
 Okay, so it's a single, you're standing on a single foot

01:11.120 --> 01:13.200
 and you're raising your other foot in the air

01:13.200 --> 01:16.680
 and it's a forward throw, which means the,

01:16.680 --> 01:19.540
 your back is facing the opponent,

01:19.540 --> 01:23.080
 but they kind of both fly through the air

01:23.080 --> 01:24.520
 and twist through the air.

01:24.520 --> 01:25.560
 Correct.

01:25.560 --> 01:28.400
 Yeah, so how does that throw work?

01:28.400 --> 01:30.400
 What are the principles behind that throw?

01:30.400 --> 01:33.440
 Is one of those throws that, you know,

01:33.440 --> 01:35.900
 people can kind of understand how to pick up

01:35.900 --> 01:38.720
 another human being in sort of trivial ways,

01:38.720 --> 01:42.060
 but the Uchi Mata to me never quite made sense,

01:42.060 --> 01:43.820
 like why it works.

01:43.820 --> 01:47.360
 There's a cork, there's a twisting motion,

01:47.360 --> 01:49.720
 there's some involvement of the hip,

01:49.720 --> 01:52.920
 but not, it's not really a hip throw

01:52.920 --> 01:55.600
 because the hip is not all the way over,

01:55.600 --> 01:58.400
 so it's not, it's a very confusing throw to me.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.920
 So I'm trying to say, can you say something through words?

02:00.920 --> 02:02.680
 It's probably one of the most difficult throws

02:02.680 --> 02:04.980
 to learn as well, because it is so complex.

02:04.980 --> 02:07.880
 You do have to stand on one leg, balance on one leg,

02:07.880 --> 02:10.040
 you know, swing your other leg through the middle,

02:10.040 --> 02:12.040
 hold your opponent up in the air,

02:12.040 --> 02:16.080
 and it's hard to, it's hard to make that contact

02:16.080 --> 02:18.400
 with upper body to your back.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.480
 You know, you have to turn your back on the throw as well.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.640
 So how does it work?

02:22.640 --> 02:24.880
 It's definitely sort of a throw

02:24.880 --> 02:28.880
 where you need to start pulling your opponent's upper body

02:28.880 --> 02:30.440
 towards you, right?

02:30.440 --> 02:32.620
 So their upper body starts coming towards you.

02:32.620 --> 02:35.120
 Your legs go towards them

02:35.120 --> 02:38.400
 as your body starts to go into the throw.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.880
 So your head is gonna go left, let's say,

02:40.880 --> 02:43.600
 your body, your legs are gonna go to the right,

02:43.600 --> 02:47.340
 your body's, your partner's gonna start to lean towards you.

02:47.340 --> 02:48.920
 And just as you start to get there,

02:48.920 --> 02:50.520
 momentum coming forward,

02:50.520 --> 02:53.360
 your leg is gonna sweep up underneath theirs,

02:53.360 --> 02:55.240
 pick them up onto your hip, right,

02:55.240 --> 02:57.280
 and then the finish of the throw is a twist.

02:57.280 --> 02:59.240
 And a lot of times, the good judoka

02:59.240 --> 03:01.560
 will leave their feet when they do the throw,

03:01.560 --> 03:04.040
 so both bodies are in the air together,

03:04.040 --> 03:05.600
 and then the thrower comes down

03:05.600 --> 03:07.520
 on top of the person being thrown.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.280
 So all four feet are in the air.

03:09.280 --> 03:10.120
 Correct.

03:10.120 --> 03:12.280
 So there's just this unstoppable force that's,

03:12.280 --> 03:13.720
 so you're all in the air.

03:13.720 --> 03:15.800
 You're basically doing a roll together.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.400
 Correct.

03:17.400 --> 03:21.680
 Okay, so who, to you, is the best uchimata,

03:21.680 --> 03:23.800
 who has, besides yourself, the...

03:23.800 --> 03:27.640
 I'm not gonna lie, there's plenty of guys

03:27.640 --> 03:29.800
 that do uchimata a lot better than I do.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.800
 You do have a nice video about the uchimata online,

03:31.800 --> 03:36.120
 but who is a great practitioner of the uchimata to you?

03:36.120 --> 03:39.720
 Right now, Shohei Ono, who's two time Olympic gold medalist,

03:39.720 --> 03:40.920
 that's his favorite throw,

03:40.920 --> 03:44.320
 and there's tons of highlight videos on the IGF

03:44.320 --> 03:47.680
 and judo fanatics showing how he does his uchimata,

03:47.680 --> 03:50.520
 and it is quite different than everybody else's,

03:50.520 --> 03:51.680
 but it's unstoppable.

03:51.680 --> 03:53.360
 When he comes in, nobody stops it.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.960
 He's won two golds in a row at the Olympics.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.440
 I think maybe in the last eight years,

03:57.440 --> 03:59.280
 the guy's lost two matches.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.840
 He's just incredible.

04:00.840 --> 04:05.040
 At a very competitive division, I guess 73 kilos?

04:05.040 --> 04:08.640
 Okay, and then three time world champ too.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.960
 Is he the greatest of all time to you?

04:10.960 --> 04:14.520
 The only reason why he's not is because Nomura

04:14.520 --> 04:15.840
 is a 60 kilo player.

04:15.840 --> 04:18.360
 He was three time Olympic champion,

04:18.360 --> 04:21.400
 so Nomura, I mean, unless Ono's gonna stick around

04:21.400 --> 04:26.400
 for another three years and win again here in Paris,

04:26.560 --> 04:28.200
 then he'd match what Nomura did,

04:28.200 --> 04:30.360
 but three time gold medalist in judo

04:30.360 --> 04:34.200
 in a lightweight division, that's pretty spectacular.

04:34.200 --> 04:38.680
 So to you, being able to win a championship,

04:38.680 --> 04:41.840
 world championship, or Olympic medal

04:41.840 --> 04:43.920
 is a measure of greatness.

04:43.920 --> 04:46.960
 It's not like you have some people

04:46.960 --> 04:49.920
 who are not as accomplished like Koga or something like that,

04:49.920 --> 04:54.920
 but just the beauty, the moments of magic,

04:55.000 --> 04:57.600
 the number of moments of magic is the highest,

04:57.600 --> 04:59.480
 even if it's not championships.

04:59.480 --> 05:00.960
 I think you have to go by that

05:00.960 --> 05:04.040
 because there's so many phenomenal judo players

05:04.040 --> 05:07.240
 that have come through the system of spectacular judo.

05:07.240 --> 05:11.600
 You have won countless major events,

05:11.600 --> 05:14.040
 but the ability to pull it together,

05:14.040 --> 05:16.520
 those magical moments, the pinnacle of the sport,

05:16.520 --> 05:18.760
 the world championships, the Olympic games,

05:18.760 --> 05:21.600
 and proving that you can do it time and time again

05:21.600 --> 05:24.440
 makes you unstoppable, it makes you the best.

05:24.440 --> 05:28.480
 There was a guy back in the 70s and 80s by the name of Fuji

05:28.480 --> 05:32.320
 and he won four world championships back to back.

05:32.320 --> 05:35.060
 And back then, the Worlds was every two years.

05:35.060 --> 05:37.640
 So here he was, a four time world champion.

05:37.640 --> 05:39.980
 That's eight years the top of the sport.

05:39.980 --> 05:43.740
 He never won an Olympic medal.

05:43.740 --> 05:45.580
 He never went to the Olympics.

05:45.580 --> 05:48.860
 So there's a guy who missed out on Olympic greatness,

05:48.860 --> 05:52.560
 but was arguably the best competitor back in that period.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.520
 By the way, same Fuji as Fuji?

05:55.520 --> 05:57.000
 Right.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.080
 Really, okay.

05:58.080 --> 06:00.620
 Wow, I didn't know there was an actual guy, Fuji.

06:00.620 --> 06:03.560
 Our brand is named after the mountain, Mount Fuji.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.640
 But this is a different guy, his name was Fuji.

06:05.640 --> 06:09.580
 All right, well, history rhymes.

06:10.700 --> 06:13.360
 What about Teddy Renier?

06:13.360 --> 06:15.440
 10 time world champ, I think,

06:15.440 --> 06:17.600
 two time gold medalist at the Olympics,

06:17.600 --> 06:20.520
 two times bronze medalist at the Olympics.

06:22.760 --> 06:26.360
 Probably the most dominant judoka ever.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.300
 Is he in the running?

06:27.300 --> 06:29.000
 What do you think about that guy?

06:29.000 --> 06:32.160
 I think he's a freak of nature, Teddy.

06:32.160 --> 06:35.560
 If you look at the size, just how tall he is,

06:35.560 --> 06:38.680
 how big he is, how physical he is of a specimen.

06:38.680 --> 06:40.640
 I sat next to him on a bus,

06:40.640 --> 06:45.640
 and his legs are literally the size of my waist.

06:45.960 --> 06:48.080
 When you sit next to him and just look at the size,

06:48.080 --> 06:49.800
 he's a big man.

06:49.800 --> 06:54.120
 So obviously to win 10 world titles in the sport of judo,

06:54.120 --> 06:58.800
 I mean, that's almost an incomprehensible feat,

06:58.800 --> 07:03.800
 two time Olympic champion, again, that puts him in one

07:03.960 --> 07:06.800
 of the maybe 10 or 12 people to ever do that

07:06.800 --> 07:08.160
 in the history of the sport.

07:08.160 --> 07:11.520
 So he's definitely got to be in the running for the best.

07:11.520 --> 07:15.600
 But technically, I don't think he's as technical

07:15.600 --> 07:20.600
 as some of the other, in terms of pure judo finesse technique.

07:21.880 --> 07:26.860
 He's powerful, he's explosive, he's dominant, he's strong.

07:26.860 --> 07:29.000
 Teddy also grips really, really well,

07:29.000 --> 07:32.400
 which makes him that much tougher to beat.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.160
 Because a lot of times heavyweights,

07:34.160 --> 07:35.080
 especially in the heavyweight division,

07:35.080 --> 07:38.480
 a lot of them just grab the gi and they go man to man

07:38.480 --> 07:41.280
 and judo to judo and take shots at each other.

07:41.280 --> 07:43.600
 And that's why a lot of them end up getting beat.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.900
 But Teddy's in control, like positionally,

07:45.900 --> 07:47.880
 he stays in really good position

07:47.880 --> 07:49.920
 and he controls his opponent the whole fight.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.240
 So they really don't have a chance against them.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.120
 He doesn't give them a chance to beat him,

07:54.120 --> 07:55.640
 which is why he's been so dominant.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.440
 But he's not really stalling.

07:57.440 --> 08:01.800
 So I mean, he does have a really nice Osorogari,

08:01.800 --> 08:06.800
 this backward trip, outside trip, in case people don't know.

08:07.120 --> 08:11.320
 And he has just like technically pretty good throws

08:11.320 --> 08:12.840
 for heavyweight.

08:12.840 --> 08:16.880
 Heavyweights can be sometimes messy with their judo.

08:16.880 --> 08:21.600
 He's pretty technical and clean

08:21.600 --> 08:24.080
 in the execution of his big throws.

08:24.080 --> 08:26.280
 But a lot of that probably has to do

08:26.280 --> 08:28.360
 with the dominant gripping that he does.

08:28.360 --> 08:30.640
 It's not defensive gripping, it's offensive gripping,

08:30.640 --> 08:32.280
 but the dominant gripping.

08:32.280 --> 08:33.120
 100%.

08:33.120 --> 08:36.040
 He controls the grips, he controls the movement

08:36.040 --> 08:37.920
 of the match as a result of that,

08:37.920 --> 08:39.720
 and then he creates his own openings.

08:39.720 --> 08:43.320
 So I mean, for a heavyweight, phenomenal technique, yes.

08:43.320 --> 08:46.400
 And what you said, messy, I'd like to call it sloppy, right?

08:46.400 --> 08:49.460
 A lot of the heavyweights tend to be sloppy.

08:49.460 --> 08:51.520
 They're falling on the ground a lot.

08:51.520 --> 08:54.480
 It's hard to move somebody that weighs 350 pounds.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.000
 It's hard to get that body moving

08:56.000 --> 08:58.400
 and just with a simple pull motion.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.920
 So he's definitely found a way to do it.

09:00.920 --> 09:03.580
 But he's also, I don't know, six foot eight.

09:03.580 --> 09:06.460
 He probably weighs 140 kilos.

09:06.460 --> 09:07.820
 He's a big boy.

09:07.820 --> 09:10.240
 But he had this winning streak of just,

09:10.240 --> 09:13.040
 I don't know how long, but like over 100 matches.

09:13.960 --> 09:17.440
 And he lost at this Olympics that we just went through,

09:17.440 --> 09:20.300
 the 20, I don't even know what to call it, 2021 Olympics.

09:20.300 --> 09:22.840
 I don't know the proper terminology.

09:22.840 --> 09:24.160
 Tokyo 2020 is what they call it.

09:24.160 --> 09:26.240
 Tokyo 2020, all right.

09:26.240 --> 09:30.120
 So he lost to Tamerlan Bashev.

09:31.200 --> 09:34.360
 I mean, it's always sad to see a sort of greatness

09:34.360 --> 09:35.200
 come to an end.

09:35.200 --> 09:39.080
 It's like Karelin in wrestling and Greco Roman.

09:39.080 --> 09:42.120
 Did you shed a bit of a tear to see greatness go?

09:42.120 --> 09:46.480
 Or is it just the way of life?

09:46.480 --> 09:50.560
 I mean, what did you think about sort of this dominance,

09:50.560 --> 09:53.820
 this run of dominance being stopped?

09:53.820 --> 09:56.640
 I think, I mean, it's obviously sad to see LFC

09:56.640 --> 09:59.400
 and champions succeed, especially people

09:59.400 --> 10:00.480
 that are good people.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.440
 And I think Teddy's a good person.

10:02.440 --> 10:04.320
 I mean, I think there's some arrogant champions

10:04.320 --> 10:06.120
 that everybody would like to see lose

10:06.120 --> 10:10.000
 just because they don't wanna deal with their personality.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
 But I think Teddy's a very humble champion.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.520
 He's a people's champion.

10:15.520 --> 10:17.880
 You know, I think he's been privileged

10:17.880 --> 10:19.800
 and he makes good money from the sport of judo

10:19.800 --> 10:21.880
 and the French Federation has taken care of him well.

10:21.880 --> 10:25.360
 So he's a lifelong judo icon.

10:25.360 --> 10:27.680
 So it's sad to see somebody like that get beat,

10:27.680 --> 10:30.760
 especially when this could have been his third Olympic title

10:30.760 --> 10:35.760
 and just put him in infamy.

10:36.680 --> 10:39.740
 So it was sad to see, but I think, you know,

10:39.740 --> 10:42.080
 every athlete goes through it, right?

10:42.080 --> 10:45.840
 I mean, it's just, that's what the Olympics is all about.

10:45.840 --> 10:48.600
 The great ones fall sometimes and.

10:48.600 --> 10:53.040
 Especially in judo, it's like so, like the margin of error.

10:53.040 --> 10:56.360
 I mean, I guess the other question I wanna ask here is,

10:56.360 --> 11:01.360
 in your sense, how difficult it is to not lose for so long?

11:02.360 --> 11:06.880
 It seems like in judo, like a little mistake and it's over.

11:06.880 --> 11:10.480
 There's no coming back and Ippon means it's over.

11:10.480 --> 11:13.000
 So how difficult is that?

11:13.000 --> 11:15.180
 It's hard to stay that dominant without question.

11:15.180 --> 11:18.040
 First of all, when you are the entire world

11:18.040 --> 11:20.280
 is training against you just to beat you.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.920
 They're studying every single movement.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.360
 They're studying patterns.

11:24.360 --> 11:25.680
 They're trying to break it down

11:25.680 --> 11:27.680
 and find a flaw in your game.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.400
 So everybody's hunting for you

11:29.400 --> 11:30.400
 when you're the best in the world,

11:30.400 --> 11:31.240
 especially at the Olympics.

11:31.240 --> 11:32.980
 That's the one to beat you at.

11:32.980 --> 11:35.000
 So everybody's focused on you.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.420
 And then there's an incredible amount of pressure

11:37.420 --> 11:38.760
 on that athlete to perform.

11:38.760 --> 11:41.040
 You carry the flag for your country

11:41.040 --> 11:43.320
 when you're at opening ceremonies sometimes.

11:43.320 --> 11:45.900
 There's all spotlight is on you.

11:46.760 --> 11:50.320
 And it's particularly hard when things don't go well early.

11:50.320 --> 11:53.200
 In other words, when you're expected to win

11:53.200 --> 11:55.640
 and then all of a sudden now you're in a hard fight

11:55.640 --> 11:57.200
 and it's not going the way you want,

11:57.200 --> 11:59.160
 that pressure, the one who's the favorite

11:59.160 --> 12:01.000
 feels the pressure the most at the Olympics.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.880
 And that's why I think the other ones are able to win it.

12:03.880 --> 12:05.640
 I've actually never gotten a chance

12:05.640 --> 12:10.640
 to listen to Teddy Renner sort of explain ideas

12:10.720 --> 12:11.920
 behind his Judo.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.760
 Like I wonder what his mental game is like

12:13.760 --> 12:16.800
 because I think his English is pretty, not very good.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.800
 And so, and I just haven't seen good interviews,

12:19.800 --> 12:21.520
 but it's always fascinating to,

12:22.560 --> 12:25.440
 there's certain great athletes

12:25.440 --> 12:28.600
 that are also great thinkers and speakers,

12:28.600 --> 12:32.160
 like the Satya brothers in wrestling.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.640
 Again, not meaning, that's on my to do list,

12:34.640 --> 12:38.200
 100%, I'm going to Dagestan and talking to them

12:38.200 --> 12:39.640
 because they're brilliant.

12:39.640 --> 12:43.760
 But to be able to sort of, maybe after retirement,

12:43.760 --> 12:46.580
 to think back, what were the systems involved?

12:46.580 --> 12:50.860
 Both on the technical, the training side,

12:50.860 --> 12:53.520
 and then the mental side.

12:53.520 --> 12:56.600
 Because to stay that dominant, just like you're saying,

12:56.600 --> 12:58.520
 everybody's studying to beat you.

13:00.440 --> 13:03.200
 And the heavyweights are just these powerful dudes.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.280
 So to be able to control them with your game

13:06.280 --> 13:09.600
 and the game that everybody knows is coming is,

13:09.600 --> 13:11.720
 I don't know, I don't know what's behind that,

13:11.720 --> 13:15.480
 but there's got to be, it feels like the mental game

13:15.480 --> 13:17.860
 is exceptionally important.

13:17.860 --> 13:19.520
 I think a lot of people underestimate

13:19.520 --> 13:22.160
 just how important that side is.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.160
 Being mentally prepared for victory,

13:24.160 --> 13:27.120
 mentally prepared to be the best, to stay the best.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.400
 There's no way that's weak minded

13:30.400 --> 13:33.480
 that they can accomplish that.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.560
 It's 100% confidence and belief in yourself.

13:36.560 --> 13:38.660
 If we take a big picture view then,

13:38.660 --> 13:39.960
 not necessarily Taylor Renner,

13:39.960 --> 13:42.600
 but if you want to go from the very beginning,

13:42.600 --> 13:47.600
 from day one of judo class to Olympic champion

13:47.740 --> 13:52.080
 or Olympic medalist, what does it take

13:52.080 --> 13:56.000
 to become an Olympic medalist in judo from start to finish?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.360
 Like how many different trajectories do you see?

13:58.360 --> 14:01.720
 Or is there some unifying principles?

14:01.720 --> 14:03.160
 I think a lot of it has to,

14:03.160 --> 14:07.000
 your journey is gonna depend a lot by where you're from.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.120
 So a path that an American might take

14:09.120 --> 14:10.960
 versus somebody who's from Japan

14:10.960 --> 14:12.800
 or somebody who's from Europe.

14:12.800 --> 14:16.680
 There's two very, three very distinct paths, right?

14:16.680 --> 14:20.000
 Because in Japan, it's part of the culture.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.280
 There's a system of excellence.

14:22.280 --> 14:25.960
 There's elementary school judo, there's junior high school,

14:25.960 --> 14:27.640
 there's high school, there's collegiate,

14:27.640 --> 14:32.640
 there's Olympic and much like our wrestling is here

14:32.640 --> 14:34.480
 in the United States, right?

14:34.480 --> 14:36.500
 It's very similar, there's youth wrestling,

14:36.500 --> 14:39.000
 there's high school, there's NCAA

14:39.000 --> 14:40.220
 and then there's Olympic wrestling.

14:40.220 --> 14:44.000
 And when your country is a factory

14:44.000 --> 14:47.120
 of producing athletes at the highest level,

14:47.120 --> 14:50.460
 then all of those top athletes typically go back

14:50.460 --> 14:52.560
 into the sport and there's professions for them.

14:52.560 --> 14:53.880
 They have an opportunity to coach

14:53.880 --> 14:55.480
 at all those different levels.

14:55.480 --> 14:58.280
 And just the level of their game and the expertise

14:58.280 --> 15:01.620
 that all of them have, even down at the elementary level,

15:01.620 --> 15:04.200
 make their skill so solid.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.000
 And as a coach, in that situation,

15:06.000 --> 15:09.640
 you can just sit back and watch who stands out

15:09.640 --> 15:12.200
 as opposed to, I think in America, I guess,

15:12.200 --> 15:15.240
 you would need to craft.

15:15.240 --> 15:17.420
 You don't get to choose from a thousand people,

15:17.420 --> 15:21.180
 a few people that naturally stand out at the age of nine.

15:21.180 --> 15:25.860
 You have to actually, whatever the natural resources

15:25.860 --> 15:29.800
 you're given, craft them into a champion.

15:30.960 --> 15:34.200
 So if we look at that, the American way,

15:34.200 --> 15:36.280
 where you just have a person with a smile

15:36.280 --> 15:41.120
 show up to your dojo, says I want to be an Olympic medalist,

15:41.120 --> 15:43.040
 what process do you take them through?

15:43.040 --> 15:45.360
 The odds are really insurmountable.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.400
 It's a very, very high hill to climb.

15:47.400 --> 15:50.040
 And there's only a few, there's only a few people

15:50.040 --> 15:52.680
 and there's only a few coaches in this entire country

15:52.680 --> 15:55.120
 that really understand that process

15:55.120 --> 15:58.280
 and that can help people reach that level,

15:58.280 --> 16:00.080
 as it's been proven, right?

16:00.080 --> 16:01.240
 Yeah.

16:01.240 --> 16:05.100
 Number one, you certainly have to have a solid base,

16:05.100 --> 16:08.240
 a fundamental base of an expectation

16:08.240 --> 16:10.120
 of what the training is gonna be.

16:10.120 --> 16:12.680
 And it has to be a level of professionalism

16:12.680 --> 16:14.440
 very, very early, where you're teaching

16:14.440 --> 16:16.880
 all the basic judo moves, all the basic fundamental

16:16.880 --> 16:20.560
 movements, posture, gripping.

16:20.560 --> 16:23.160
 Well, maybe gripping doesn't come in so early in the game,

16:23.160 --> 16:26.640
 but throwing methodology, movements,

16:26.640 --> 16:30.880
 niwaza position, standing fundamental throws.

16:30.880 --> 16:33.960
 And I think most importantly is really the work ethic,

16:33.960 --> 16:35.800
 just the way you're gonna train,

16:35.800 --> 16:37.360
 the intensity you're gonna train with,

16:37.360 --> 16:42.360
 the ability to, mindset of going to tournaments constantly.

16:42.440 --> 16:44.360
 In order to compete with the rest of the world,

16:44.360 --> 16:49.360
 our young kids need to be tested a lot when they're young.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.400
 They have to be put through adversity

16:51.400 --> 16:53.240
 because they don't get put through adversity in training

16:53.240 --> 16:55.000
 because you don't have that many good training partners.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.760
 So you get put through adversity in competition

16:57.760 --> 16:59.520
 and then we see what your weaknesses are

16:59.520 --> 17:02.580
 and we continue to make improvements on those.

17:02.580 --> 17:05.000
 But the journey is, it's long.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.080
 And until they're kind of at the teenage years,

17:08.080 --> 17:10.160
 they're gonna have to pretty much stay domestic, right?

17:10.160 --> 17:12.560
 Cause they gotta go through life as a normal kid,

17:12.560 --> 17:15.320
 but they've gotta be training in the dojo at least,

17:15.320 --> 17:17.040
 five days a week.

17:17.040 --> 17:20.360
 Sometimes they might wanna get an extra technical workout in

17:20.360 --> 17:23.160
 or doing some base conditioning in addition to that.

17:23.160 --> 17:24.720
 And then really at the teenage years,

17:24.720 --> 17:28.760
 that's where we really, we've struggled in America

17:28.760 --> 17:31.900
 of keeping teens in the sport of Judo

17:31.900 --> 17:34.520
 as well as developing them properly.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.280
 Cause up until around the teenage years,

17:36.280 --> 17:39.300
 I think the Americans are on par with the rest of the world

17:39.300 --> 17:41.800
 in terms of technique and in terms of skill

17:41.800 --> 17:45.880
 and we've proven we can compete with the rest of the world

17:45.880 --> 17:46.720
 up until that age.

17:46.720 --> 17:50.780
 But that's where Japan and that's where the Europeans

17:50.780 --> 17:52.920
 and the countries that are strong in Judo,

17:52.920 --> 17:55.420
 that's where they put a lot of time, energy and effort

17:55.420 --> 17:59.160
 is it to the teens where they have a great coaching staff,

17:59.160 --> 18:02.000
 they have good training camps with 800,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.720
 a thousand people going to them every single weekend.

18:05.760 --> 18:07.280
 When you say teens, what do you mean?

18:07.280 --> 18:09.040
 Do you mean literally like 13?

18:09.040 --> 18:12.480
 Yeah, age 13 to 17, 13 to 19.

18:12.480 --> 18:15.680
 And that's where you really accelerate your development.

18:15.680 --> 18:19.160
 So you're saying like in America, when you're young,

18:19.160 --> 18:24.160
 like before nine, 10, 11, 12, you stick in Judo,

18:24.320 --> 18:26.120
 you can progress quite a bit.

18:26.120 --> 18:28.920
 But then I guess the other competition there,

18:28.920 --> 18:33.920
 if you're into two people doing stuff to each other

18:33.920 --> 18:38.920
 in a combative way, the other competitor

18:39.960 --> 18:41.640
 in America is wrestling.

18:41.640 --> 18:45.560
 So Judo almost primes you, like it teaches you

18:45.560 --> 18:47.560
 how to be a great wrestler as well.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.760
 And so then you have to have a hard decision

18:51.640 --> 18:54.720
 because you can probably be a collegiate wrestler.

18:54.720 --> 18:59.720
 You have like a clear plan of where you're going to go

19:00.040 --> 19:01.000
 if you wanna be a wrestler.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
 With Judo, that plan is less clear.

19:07.280 --> 19:10.360
 So you have to be on your own a bit with your coach,

19:10.360 --> 19:11.200
 that kind of thing.

19:11.200 --> 19:12.120
 Exactly.

19:12.120 --> 19:14.440
 Okay, so when you're on your own with your coach,

19:14.440 --> 19:16.160
 to me, that's just a fascinating journey

19:16.160 --> 19:19.200
 because then it's just like the purity of it.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.700
 It's the coach and the athlete and the dream.

19:22.560 --> 19:25.680
 It's all about the dedication, the five, six,

19:25.680 --> 19:30.680
 seven days a week competing, what, once a month, twice a month.

19:33.320 --> 19:36.880
 Okay, but also, you probably don't have that conversation.

19:36.880 --> 19:37.720
 I don't know if you do.

19:37.720 --> 19:40.360
 Maybe you do, saying like, we're gonna do this

19:40.360 --> 19:41.760
 for the next eight years.

19:41.760 --> 19:44.840
 Right.

19:44.840 --> 19:45.680
 Do you ever sit down?

19:45.680 --> 19:47.960
 Would you just take it the David Goggins way,

19:47.960 --> 19:50.720
 which is like, let's just take it one step at a time.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.040
 Let's hope we're there in eight years.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.160
 Yeah, let's hope we're there.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.360
 Do you actually?

19:56.360 --> 19:58.160
 Like right now, you have to think about,

19:58.160 --> 20:02.040
 the Olympics is gonna be in Los Angeles in 2028.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.720
 So it's really interesting.

20:03.720 --> 20:06.600
 Now would be the time, and now is the time,

20:06.600 --> 20:11.500
 to identify talent and get commitment out of students

20:11.500 --> 20:14.900
 that in seven years, you can make a US Olympic team

20:14.900 --> 20:17.280
 because we're gonna have a full team.

20:17.280 --> 20:20.160
 America's gonna have 14 athletes compete in those games,

20:20.160 --> 20:21.640
 one in every weight class.

20:21.640 --> 20:23.720
 So now's the time, if you're gonna go on a journey

20:23.720 --> 20:25.960
 to the Olympics and stay with the sport of judo,

20:25.960 --> 20:28.440
 now would be the time to do it, you know?

20:28.440 --> 20:33.240
 And so what, you show up to the Pedro Judo Center

20:33.240 --> 20:38.240
 and how much drilling, how much technique,

20:38.240 --> 20:41.320
 strategy discussions, how much randori,

20:41.320 --> 20:44.080
 or like live sparring, how much conditioning

20:44.080 --> 20:48.080
 and strength training, how much of all that?

20:49.200 --> 20:51.240
 How much of cross training to other gyms

20:51.240 --> 20:53.680
 or something like that, traveling abroad?

20:53.680 --> 20:56.860
 Is there something to be said about some aspects

20:56.860 --> 20:57.700
 of that system?

20:57.700 --> 20:58.640
 For sure.

20:58.640 --> 20:59.740
 You need it all.

20:59.740 --> 21:01.080
 What you just said, you need it all of it.

21:01.080 --> 21:02.180
 And we do do all of that.

21:02.180 --> 21:05.040
 Right now, we have a young group of kids at the Academy,

21:05.040 --> 21:05.920
 you'll see tonight.

21:05.920 --> 21:09.320
 Some of them are 14, 13, 15, 17.

21:09.320 --> 21:10.160
 Are they good?

21:10.160 --> 21:10.980
 Yeah, really good.

21:10.980 --> 21:12.560
 Okay, can't wait.

21:12.560 --> 21:14.400
 They're right around your waist, so it'll be perfect.

21:14.400 --> 21:15.240
 That's nice.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.740
 They're just young boys,

21:17.740 --> 21:20.520
 but they've been training hard through COVID.

21:20.520 --> 21:23.800
 We've been, Travis and myself have been training them.

21:23.800 --> 21:26.220
 We share responsibilities.

21:26.220 --> 21:28.920
 They're doing randori like five nights a week.

21:28.920 --> 21:33.000
 We have them doing randori Tuesdays, Wednesdays,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.520
 Thursdays, Fridays, and Sundays

21:35.520 --> 21:36.520
 is when they're doing randori.

21:36.520 --> 21:37.840
 They're coming to the dojo Friday night

21:37.840 --> 21:39.440
 and Sunday night to do training.

21:40.460 --> 21:42.600
 We also have technical sessions for them.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.660
 They're in school now, so it's a little bit challenging,

21:44.660 --> 21:46.520
 but they come five o clock in the afternoon

21:46.520 --> 21:48.220
 and they do a technical session.

21:48.220 --> 21:50.320
 Through COVID, they were coming every morning

21:50.320 --> 21:51.720
 doing technical sessions.

21:51.720 --> 21:53.160
 What's a technical session?

21:53.160 --> 21:56.220
 It's an hour of repetitive throwing

21:56.220 --> 21:59.240
 or repetitive drilling to reinforce movements

21:59.240 --> 22:03.080
 that we deem important to our successful system.

22:03.080 --> 22:06.060
 So, niwaza positions, groundwork positions,

22:06.060 --> 22:08.200
 where we want them to be put in this position

22:08.200 --> 22:10.400
 and they're gonna drill it 50 times

22:10.400 --> 22:12.960
 with resistance in big groups,

22:12.960 --> 22:15.080
 doing drills over and over again,

22:15.080 --> 22:17.320
 picking apart the details of the technique

22:17.320 --> 22:18.360
 and what they're doing wrong,

22:18.360 --> 22:19.920
 showing them how to fix it.

22:19.920 --> 22:21.320
 But now, we've done it so much

22:21.320 --> 22:23.640
 that now we can do a whole drill session with them

22:23.640 --> 22:25.600
 where they know all the different techniques

22:25.600 --> 22:27.200
 inside and out and they can move

22:27.200 --> 22:29.000
 from position to position really quickly.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.760
 Do they do it for a period of time,

22:31.760 --> 22:33.920
 like two minutes, five minutes,

22:33.920 --> 22:37.060
 or is it like one, two, they're actually counting?

22:37.060 --> 22:38.720
 No, sometimes it's both.

22:38.720 --> 22:40.240
 So sometimes we do it for reps,

22:40.240 --> 22:42.400
 sometimes we do it for time.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.920
 So sometimes it might be as many as they can do

22:44.920 --> 22:48.000
 in 60 seconds or as many as they can do in two minutes.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.320
 And sometimes it might just be,

22:49.320 --> 22:51.880
 I want you to do every position five times.

22:51.880 --> 22:53.680
 In terms of throws,

22:53.680 --> 22:55.640
 we're not talking about it on a crash pad, right?

22:55.640 --> 22:56.480
 It's just.

22:56.480 --> 22:58.680
 We're talking about free moving around the mat.

22:58.680 --> 23:01.500
 And just dynamically and just throwing.

23:01.500 --> 23:02.340
 Correct.

23:02.340 --> 23:06.860
 How many, because as I was mentioning to you offline,

23:06.860 --> 23:08.280
 Travis threw me a few times,

23:09.200 --> 23:11.760
 a lot of times when he was visiting in Austin,

23:11.760 --> 23:14.040
 and I just remembered,

23:14.040 --> 23:15.920
 so there's two things.

23:15.920 --> 23:18.420
 Fortunately or unfortunately in my life,

23:18.420 --> 23:22.360
 having gotten a chance to train with folks of that level,

23:22.360 --> 23:25.120
 with just cleanness of throw and the power,

23:25.120 --> 23:26.600
 and it was very nice.

23:26.600 --> 23:30.040
 I immediately actually enjoyed being thrown like that.

23:31.240 --> 23:33.140
 To throw a little shade at Craig Jones

23:33.140 --> 23:34.840
 with his current mat situation,

23:36.080 --> 23:38.420
 is they're very, they were quite thin.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.160
 And as Travis commented on,

23:41.160 --> 23:42.780
 and not just the thinness of the mats,

23:42.780 --> 23:45.540
 but they were laid on like concrete, right?

23:45.540 --> 23:49.240
 So I felt, it's like soft until it's not.

23:50.680 --> 23:53.800
 But being thrown very cleanly,

23:53.800 --> 23:55.040
 I just felt like there's,

23:55.040 --> 23:57.080
 this is not gonna lead to injury, it was great.

23:57.080 --> 23:59.040
 It wasn't injury prone.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.880
 But then as I mentioned to you,

24:00.880 --> 24:02.940
 when a day or two after,

24:02.940 --> 24:06.600
 my entire leg, one of them, I guess it's the left leg,

24:08.020 --> 24:11.320
 was just black, a bruise.

24:11.320 --> 24:12.680
 It didn't hurt too bad,

24:12.680 --> 24:14.480
 but it was just, the body's gotten soft.

24:14.480 --> 24:17.080
 So I guess the question I have is,

24:17.080 --> 24:21.480
 does the body get used to just that number of throws?

24:21.480 --> 24:26.300
 Just over time, being thrown thousands of times a month?

24:26.300 --> 24:27.300
 Unquestionably.

24:27.300 --> 24:28.760
 Your body gets used to it.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.880
 So it hardens, it gets really hard.

24:30.880 --> 24:33.920
 Which is why judo is hard to come back to

24:33.920 --> 24:35.760
 after you've taken a long period of time off,

24:35.760 --> 24:38.420
 because your body is not used to that impact anymore.

24:39.300 --> 24:42.200
 I always found out that when I was training judo a lot,

24:42.200 --> 24:46.120
 it's hard to shed weight and keep weight off,

24:46.120 --> 24:50.680
 because your body, it develops this layer of protection

24:50.680 --> 24:53.040
 on itself that it doesn't wanna give up.

24:53.040 --> 24:54.120
 When you're sucking a lot of weight,

24:54.120 --> 24:55.560
 that means you're frail.

24:55.560 --> 24:59.160
 So I always seem to retain weight more

24:59.160 --> 25:00.560
 when you're doing hard judo training,

25:00.560 --> 25:02.920
 as opposed to losing weight.

25:02.920 --> 25:05.320
 It's easy when you go out for runs and things like that

25:05.320 --> 25:06.580
 to shed the water weight,

25:06.580 --> 25:09.480
 but to actually keep the pounds off was pretty hard.

25:09.480 --> 25:12.800
 Yeah, the body develops, like you said, a level of protection.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.520
 What about the randori?

25:14.520 --> 25:15.800
 Just out of curiosity, again,

25:15.800 --> 25:18.920
 I haven't ever had the opportunity to train

25:18.920 --> 25:20.400
 with folks at a high level.

25:22.440 --> 25:26.600
 In jiu jitsu, there's different gyms at different styles,

25:26.600 --> 25:29.180
 but I've noticed that at the highest levels,

25:29.180 --> 25:33.200
 people can go pretty hard in a certain kind of way

25:33.200 --> 25:35.480
 where it's more technical,

25:35.480 --> 25:39.560
 and you're moving at 100%,

25:39.560 --> 25:43.600
 but the power is not at 100%.

25:43.600 --> 25:45.680
 It's a weird little dance.

25:46.560 --> 25:51.080
 You're not really forcing stuff.

25:51.080 --> 25:53.880
 You're more focused on the right timing,

25:53.880 --> 25:58.140
 the right positioning of hands and feet and body

25:58.140 --> 25:59.140
 and all those kinds of things.

25:59.140 --> 26:02.560
 You're not forcing stuff in the way you would in competition,

26:02.560 --> 26:04.160
 like really the power.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.560
 Does that sound similar to you

26:05.560 --> 26:07.240
 for the way you try to do randori?

26:07.240 --> 26:08.920
 So there's different styles of judo,

26:08.920 --> 26:10.760
 and I'd say the Japanese style,

26:10.760 --> 26:12.160
 the technical style of judo

26:12.160 --> 26:14.120
 is exactly what you just talked about.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.360
 It's almost like two guys in pajamas, right?

26:18.000 --> 26:20.720
 We're using minimal effort, maximum efficiency.

26:20.720 --> 26:21.640
 We're moving around,

26:21.640 --> 26:23.680
 and we're trying to feel that movement,

26:23.680 --> 26:25.940
 and it's timing and finesse and technique

26:25.940 --> 26:28.060
 and fun and clean throws.

26:28.060 --> 26:30.840
 And when you train in Japan,

26:30.840 --> 26:34.840
 you can train 15 rounds of randori, five minute rounds.

26:34.840 --> 26:38.640
 That's 75 minutes of straight sparring.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.480
 You can do that straight in Japan without a problem.

26:41.480 --> 26:42.840
 I mean, you'll get tired, of course.

26:42.840 --> 26:45.760
 You're gonna fall a lot, you're gonna throw a lot,

26:45.760 --> 26:48.120
 but it's very free feeling,

26:48.120 --> 26:50.360
 and it's technical as you explained.

26:50.360 --> 26:51.880
 But then when you go to Europe

26:51.880 --> 26:53.900
 and you try to do rounds with the Europeans,

26:53.900 --> 26:55.200
 they are very physical.

26:55.200 --> 26:58.960
 They don't have that same finesse in their training

26:58.960 --> 27:00.340
 that they do in Japan.

27:00.340 --> 27:02.200
 In Europe, you'd be hard pressed

27:02.200 --> 27:04.320
 to do eight rounds of randori in a night.

27:04.320 --> 27:06.400
 It's so physically exhausting

27:06.400 --> 27:09.480
 because so much effort is going into just fighting

27:09.480 --> 27:11.500
 and fending off the gripping system

27:11.500 --> 27:13.560
 and the power of your opponent.

27:13.560 --> 27:16.280
 You're physically drained after eight rounds of randori.

27:16.280 --> 27:18.340
 So it's a much different feel.

27:18.340 --> 27:19.680
 When you say Europe,

27:19.680 --> 27:22.960
 do you mean Germany, France, Britain, Russia?

27:22.960 --> 27:23.800
 Is there a lot?

27:23.800 --> 27:27.040
 So there's a kind of similarity

27:27.040 --> 27:28.840
 to all of those kinds of approaches.

27:28.840 --> 27:30.080
 The only difference would be Russia

27:30.080 --> 27:32.840
 that they do a lot more active drilling,

27:32.840 --> 27:35.440
 a lot more sequential movement training.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.960
 They don't focus as much on randori.

27:37.960 --> 27:42.480
 You'll do much fewer rounds in Russia during training camps

27:42.480 --> 27:44.120
 than you would in those other countries

27:44.120 --> 27:46.780
 we just talked about, France, Germany, et cetera.

27:46.780 --> 27:48.920
 What about in this kind of American system

27:48.920 --> 27:53.480
 where you have much less talent to work with?

27:55.320 --> 27:58.960
 Do you just select whatever works

27:58.960 --> 28:00.080
 for the particular athletes,

28:00.080 --> 28:03.600
 or do you have something you prefer in your system?

28:03.600 --> 28:05.520
 So you need a combination of all of it.

28:05.520 --> 28:06.960
 If you're gonna win at the Olympic level,

28:06.960 --> 28:10.320
 you have to be able to deal with the finesse of the Japanese,

28:10.320 --> 28:12.340
 the physicality of the Europeans.

28:12.340 --> 28:14.560
 You have to focus on the ground,

28:14.560 --> 28:17.240
 niwaza aspect, because a lot of people are weak there

28:17.240 --> 28:18.760
 in the world of the sport of judo.

28:18.760 --> 28:20.400
 That's a chance to win.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.880
 We've sort of developed our American system of judo,

28:22.880 --> 28:24.840
 at least for the last,

28:24.840 --> 28:26.360
 I'd say probably the last 20 years

28:26.360 --> 28:27.960
 it'd be the American system of judo,

28:27.960 --> 28:31.640
 which relies heavily on taking the individual

28:31.640 --> 28:34.080
 and whatever techniques they do,

28:34.080 --> 28:37.800
 perfecting those techniques and the combinations

28:37.800 --> 28:40.080
 and other throws that go with those throws,

28:40.080 --> 28:43.240
 but then implementing and overlaying an American system

28:43.240 --> 28:47.700
 of gripping, niwaza, conditioning, mentality,

28:47.700 --> 28:51.600
 training methodology, and game planning

28:51.600 --> 28:52.640
 to beat your opponents.

28:52.640 --> 28:55.660
 And I think that's the secret sauce to success

28:55.660 --> 28:58.400
 for your Americans, because there's no way,

28:58.400 --> 29:00.960
 if we don't have eight partners to train with in a night

29:00.960 --> 29:02.720
 that are gonna give us good rounds, right?

29:02.720 --> 29:05.320
 We might have two, so we're gonna have the same guy

29:05.320 --> 29:07.920
 four times, those two people four, two times each.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.100
 Now I have four good rounds.

29:09.100 --> 29:11.520
 The rest of the rounds, I'm not being pushed to the limit.

29:11.520 --> 29:12.860
 So we train differently.

29:14.200 --> 29:17.160
 And a lot of times we do a lot of stuff like shark bait.

29:17.160 --> 29:19.240
 When our athletes are preparing for competition,

29:19.240 --> 29:21.000
 for example, when Kayla or Travis

29:21.000 --> 29:23.620
 were preparing for competition,

29:23.620 --> 29:26.360
 we might only have 20 people in the whole gym

29:26.360 --> 29:29.280
 to work out with, those two Olympic medalists, right?

29:29.280 --> 29:30.840
 And of those 20 people,

29:30.840 --> 29:33.880
 maybe four of them are Travis's size.

29:33.880 --> 29:36.280
 Maybe there's only one girl in the room for Kayla,

29:36.280 --> 29:37.480
 she's gotta train with guys.

29:37.480 --> 29:38.860
 And then the other ones are teenagers

29:38.860 --> 29:41.320
 that are too weak to train with either one of them.

29:41.320 --> 29:43.080
 So what we would do is just put together

29:43.080 --> 29:46.680
 four or five people that could give them a challenge

29:46.680 --> 29:48.480
 and we'd line them up and they would do a minute,

29:48.480 --> 29:49.720
 a minute, a minute, a minute,

29:49.720 --> 29:52.560
 and they'd do five minutes in a row as hard as they can.

29:52.560 --> 29:55.480
 That person can go hard for a minute with Travis or Kayla.

29:55.480 --> 29:56.800
 They can't go five minutes hard,

29:56.800 --> 29:58.240
 but they can go one minute hard.

29:58.240 --> 30:01.720
 So it made their training much, much more intense,

30:01.720 --> 30:03.320
 much more physically demanding.

30:03.320 --> 30:06.160
 And then rinse and repeat that six times

30:06.160 --> 30:08.240
 or eight times in a night,

30:08.240 --> 30:10.680
 they just got 40 minutes of intense randori.

30:10.680 --> 30:13.280
 The person that was training with them that wasn't as good

30:13.280 --> 30:14.600
 only had to do six or eight minutes

30:14.600 --> 30:16.700
 of training the whole night, you know, so.

30:16.700 --> 30:21.640
 It's so, it's so difficult because then you look

30:21.640 --> 30:24.120
 at like the Russian national team

30:25.180 --> 30:30.040
 and you have just the world champions and so,

30:33.600 --> 30:36.600
 or you even have like, what is it,

30:36.600 --> 30:39.700
 Tom Brands and Terry Brands in the wrestling system.

30:39.700 --> 30:43.100
 You have like these people, it's a small group of people,

30:43.100 --> 30:45.760
 but they're all some of the best people in the world

30:45.760 --> 30:47.360
 and they're going head to head.

30:47.360 --> 30:50.000
 And yeah, you don't necessarily get a good look

30:50.000 --> 30:55.000
 kind of a variety of styles, but just the quality is there.

30:55.120 --> 30:58.640
 And even that is missing for people your size in America,

30:58.640 --> 31:02.360
 because that is so difficult to work with,

31:02.360 --> 31:05.520
 which it makes Kayla's and makes Travis's story

31:05.520 --> 31:06.860
 that much more amazing.

31:08.120 --> 31:11.600
 You mentioned kind of picking whatever the set of techniques

31:11.600 --> 31:15.880
 the athlete is naturally good at or prefers or whatever.

31:16.840 --> 31:19.700
 How much specialization is there?

31:19.700 --> 31:21.600
 Maybe if I give you like two choices,

31:21.600 --> 31:24.200
 is it good to have like one throw

31:25.080 --> 31:27.000
 and try to become the best person in the world

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
 at that throw, or do you want to have a bunch of stuff?

31:31.000 --> 31:32.960
 Like a variety of throws?

31:32.960 --> 31:34.720
 Well, for Travis, it was Ippon Seinagi,

31:34.720 --> 31:36.440
 that was his main throw, right?

31:36.440 --> 31:39.200
 But from that Ippon Seinagi, he had a variety

31:39.200 --> 31:41.440
 of other attacks he could do, you know,

31:41.440 --> 31:44.320
 that mixed it up so that you kept people guessing.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.200
 Maybe it wasn't the Ippon Seinagi that was coming,

31:46.200 --> 31:48.420
 maybe it was the Koshi Gruma that he did,

31:48.420 --> 31:50.240
 or maybe it was the Ippon to Osoto

31:50.240 --> 31:51.400
 that he did in combination.

31:51.400 --> 31:55.080
 So you typically have one main throw that you do.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.840
 For me, it was Tai Otoshi.

31:56.840 --> 31:58.840
 For Kayla, it was her Ogoshi.

31:58.840 --> 32:01.200
 For Travis, it was his Ippon Seinagi.

32:01.200 --> 32:04.120
 But then you come up with a variety of other throws

32:04.120 --> 32:06.380
 that you do from the very same grip.

32:06.380 --> 32:08.360
 So whatever grip you take for your main throw,

32:08.360 --> 32:11.600
 you wanna develop, you know, an arsenal of attacks

32:11.600 --> 32:15.080
 that go in all different directions holding that same grip.

32:15.080 --> 32:18.280
 So you keep your opponent guessing as to what's coming.

32:18.280 --> 32:20.920
 You know, because if they're just sitting on one technique

32:20.920 --> 32:22.320
 at the highest level of sport,

32:22.320 --> 32:23.800
 with the exception of a few, right?

32:23.800 --> 32:26.160
 We talked about Ono's Uchi Mata.

32:26.160 --> 32:27.460
 With the exception of a few,

32:27.460 --> 32:29.480
 most of the world catches on pretty quick

32:29.480 --> 32:30.840
 on how to beat you.

32:30.840 --> 32:33.040
 There is something to just sticking,

32:33.040 --> 32:36.240
 making sure you really dedicate to the main thing.

32:36.240 --> 32:39.680
 So for Travis, that would be like the main version

32:39.680 --> 32:41.400
 of his Seinagi.

32:41.400 --> 32:43.920
 Like really making sure you don't forget

32:43.920 --> 32:46.200
 to really put in the time on that.

32:46.200 --> 32:51.200
 Because I mean, one way to say it is

32:51.920 --> 32:55.940
 that threat being dangerous opens up a lot of things.

32:55.940 --> 32:57.160
 Right.

32:57.160 --> 32:59.260
 But also, I don't know.

33:00.760 --> 33:02.560
 I think I'm just, as a fan,

33:02.560 --> 33:06.760
 I think it's sad when like elite level athletes

33:06.760 --> 33:09.300
 in all like combat sports,

33:09.300 --> 33:12.520
 kind of start taking their main thing for granted.

33:12.520 --> 33:16.540
 Like they think, okay, I've figured that part out.

33:16.540 --> 33:18.680
 Now I'll be working on all this whole system

33:18.680 --> 33:20.800
 on variations, on different setups,

33:20.800 --> 33:24.880
 on lefty versus, some like weird variation

33:24.880 --> 33:27.160
 as opposed to, you know what?

33:27.160 --> 33:29.360
 If you look at some of the best people ever,

33:29.360 --> 33:32.840
 they seem to have not cared about variations at all.

33:32.840 --> 33:34.880
 They're just like literally,

33:34.880 --> 33:37.740
 they are more like Jiro James of Sushi

33:37.740 --> 33:42.480
 and like fine tuning their ear,

33:42.480 --> 33:45.600
 their ability to detect the minute movements

33:45.600 --> 33:48.160
 that give you an opening on that main thing.

33:48.160 --> 33:52.680
 And so the whole time you're just waiting for that throw,

33:52.680 --> 33:55.880
 you're like dancing with the like little bit of pressure

33:55.880 --> 33:58.600
 and like releasing the pressure, putting the pressure,

33:58.600 --> 34:00.600
 maybe a little bit of off balance

34:00.600 --> 34:03.900
 and finding like the right moment to strike

34:03.900 --> 34:05.400
 and focusing on that.

34:05.400 --> 34:08.160
 Again, maybe that's just like a romanticization

34:08.160 --> 34:10.940
 of like the simplicity of that.

34:10.940 --> 34:13.940
 Maybe it is kind of impossible to do that on a large scale,

34:13.940 --> 34:18.940
 but I just, yeah, I don't know if you can comment on that,

34:19.960 --> 34:22.260
 whether there is some value in still putting in

34:22.260 --> 34:25.440
 like tens of thousands of reps on the main, main thing.

34:25.440 --> 34:27.840
 Well, unquestionably that has to happen.

34:27.840 --> 34:30.080
 You still have to drill your main throw

34:30.080 --> 34:31.360
 and you have to fine tune it

34:31.360 --> 34:34.320
 and continue to do repetition after repetition

34:34.320 --> 34:37.120
 and throws on the crash pad or throws on the mat,

34:37.120 --> 34:39.160
 moving around, just explosive movements

34:39.160 --> 34:40.160
 doing your main technique.

34:40.160 --> 34:41.320
 You're never gonna forget that

34:41.320 --> 34:43.080
 and you're not gonna put it to the side

34:43.080 --> 34:44.160
 and not practice it anymore.

34:44.160 --> 34:46.160
 It still has to be part of your repertoire

34:46.160 --> 34:49.720
 and part of your daily training, but you do have to evolve.

34:49.720 --> 34:54.320
 And I think that's the sport of judo, makes you evolve.

34:54.320 --> 34:56.900
 When I look at, we talk about Koga from before, right?

34:56.900 --> 34:59.760
 And we talked about, he had a dynamic Ippon Seinagi

34:59.760 --> 35:01.920
 that nobody could stop for years and years and years.

35:01.920 --> 35:05.080
 But when people started to be unorthodox

35:05.080 --> 35:07.520
 and come down his back and cross grip him

35:07.520 --> 35:09.520
 and he couldn't get to the lapel,

35:09.520 --> 35:10.920
 he had to come up with something else.

35:10.920 --> 35:14.160
 And all of a sudden you saw Koga doing, now he did a Sode

35:14.160 --> 35:15.720
 or now he did a Tomoe Nagi,

35:15.720 --> 35:18.480
 which so he can, he added to his arsenal

35:18.480 --> 35:20.460
 to keep people thinking, keep people guessing.

35:20.460 --> 35:22.760
 So it's not, you're not just that one trick pony.

35:22.760 --> 35:25.220
 They still couldn't stop his Ippon Seinagi

35:25.220 --> 35:26.800
 once he got that grip.

35:26.800 --> 35:28.680
 But if they stopped them from getting that grip

35:28.680 --> 35:30.240
 or putting two hands on the gi,

35:30.240 --> 35:31.700
 he had to go to something else.

35:31.700 --> 35:32.960
 And that's what he did.

35:32.960 --> 35:36.700
 Does Travis's or Koga's Seinagi make sense to you?

35:36.700 --> 35:38.840
 That weird, so when I,

35:38.840 --> 35:41.240
 Because split hip, split hip.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.720
 So I don't know if you know this,

35:43.720 --> 35:45.660
 but like I got into judo because of Travis.

35:45.660 --> 35:47.960
 I watched him at 2008 Olympics and I was,

35:47.960 --> 35:51.960
 there's something about like, just not the cockiness,

35:51.960 --> 35:55.460
 but the confidence and just the refusal to quit,

35:55.460 --> 35:57.640
 the refusal to just, that energy,

35:57.640 --> 35:59.240
 whatever it connected with me is like,

35:59.240 --> 36:01.120
 oh, that guy's bad ass.

36:01.120 --> 36:03.160
 I want to be bad ass like that.

36:03.160 --> 36:06.120
 And then I also there happened to be in my university judo

36:06.120 --> 36:10.120
 and I got into it and just fell in love with the elegance

36:10.120 --> 36:12.120
 and the beauty and the power of the sport.

36:13.560 --> 36:18.560
 But also I started to mimic Travis's game, his and Koga's.

36:18.920 --> 36:21.880
 And then the instructors I worked with,

36:21.880 --> 36:24.360
 they said that's the wrong way to do it.

36:24.360 --> 36:28.400
 And I always, I never found somebody that told me like,

36:28.400 --> 36:29.680
 no, that's not the wrong way.

36:29.680 --> 36:31.100
 There's a lot of ways to do it.

36:31.100 --> 36:32.760
 And there's like the classic way

36:32.760 --> 36:34.400
 and you have to understand it and you have to learn it,

36:34.400 --> 36:36.040
 but this is not the wrong way.

36:36.040 --> 36:37.540
 Cause I was trying to find somebody

36:37.540 --> 36:39.060
 who understands this throw.

36:39.960 --> 36:42.400
 Cause it was so beautiful at the highest level,

36:42.400 --> 36:44.960
 especially with Koga, the way you're able,

36:44.960 --> 36:46.960
 the quickness with which you can strike,

36:46.960 --> 36:48.680
 the fact that you can stand on the feet

36:48.680 --> 36:52.560
 and the elevation you can get and the power you can get

36:52.560 --> 36:57.120
 has certain throws, just like Uchimata

36:57.120 --> 36:58.960
 doesn't look powerful.

36:58.960 --> 37:02.400
 It's just like, it looks effortless.

37:02.400 --> 37:06.760
 But like the standing Seinagi with a split hip,

37:06.760 --> 37:10.240
 it just looks powerful because there's a,

37:10.240 --> 37:12.600
 you're like, you're stepping into them,

37:12.600 --> 37:14.760
 you're lifting the opponent and they still have,

37:14.760 --> 37:17.200
 they're not surprised, they're now like helpless.

37:17.200 --> 37:19.840
 Right, their feet are fluttering in the air.

37:19.840 --> 37:22.000
 And then there's just this pause

37:22.000 --> 37:23.880
 and then just big slam.

37:23.880 --> 37:25.360
 With the Uchimata, it's almost like

37:25.360 --> 37:26.760
 you don't know what hit you.

37:27.600 --> 37:29.000
 It's like Taitoshi is the same.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.040
 It's almost like a surprise.

37:30.040 --> 37:32.160
 Like, oh shit, I'm now on my back.

37:32.160 --> 37:37.160
 And so I just love that throw,

37:37.200 --> 37:40.400
 but like it didn't make sense to me.

37:40.400 --> 37:42.880
 Like when trying to explain it to others,

37:42.880 --> 37:45.360
 when trying to learn, it didn't make sense to me

37:45.360 --> 37:46.200
 how it works.

37:46.200 --> 37:47.440
 Does it make sense to you?

37:47.440 --> 37:48.280
 It does.

37:48.280 --> 37:50.120
 I was born a Judoka, right?

37:50.120 --> 37:54.480
 So I've lived this stuff since I was an infant

37:54.480 --> 37:57.280
 and I've seen every style and every technique.

37:58.160 --> 38:00.960
 The split hip Saiyan Aiki is difficult to learn.

38:00.960 --> 38:03.920
 It's harder to learn than the basic form,

38:03.920 --> 38:08.040
 but it is powerful and it does, upon entry,

38:08.040 --> 38:09.200
 both of your opponent's feet

38:09.200 --> 38:10.440
 leave the mat at the same time.

38:10.440 --> 38:11.280
 So you've got them.

38:11.280 --> 38:12.640
 Once you enter, you've got them.

38:12.640 --> 38:13.800
 You just gotta finish, right?

38:13.800 --> 38:15.360
 You just gotta lock them and turn and go.

38:15.360 --> 38:17.160
 So it makes sense to me.

38:17.160 --> 38:20.000
 My dad did teach me how to do that when I was younger.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.400
 Yeah, he wanted me to do a split hip.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.320
 We have kids at the school today

38:23.320 --> 38:26.040
 that we teach the split hip Saiyan Aiki, same way,

38:27.120 --> 38:28.520
 because it is that dynamic, right?

38:28.520 --> 38:31.360
 You don't drop to the ground and roll and turn.

38:31.360 --> 38:32.920
 It's not the classic form

38:32.920 --> 38:34.240
 where you're giving way to your opponent.

38:34.240 --> 38:36.600
 It's actually, you go pick the guy up in the air

38:36.600 --> 38:37.920
 and then you slam him, so.

38:39.080 --> 38:41.840
 Okay, beautiful.

38:41.840 --> 38:43.960
 So maybe on a small tangent,

38:43.960 --> 38:46.360
 so we're talking about elite level athletes

38:46.360 --> 38:49.960
 in terms of Randori, in terms of like drilling.

38:49.960 --> 38:53.040
 For more recreational athletes,

38:53.040 --> 38:56.440
 like, you know, I have personally that situation going on,

38:56.440 --> 38:57.440
 but there's other people

38:57.440 --> 39:00.120
 that are just recreationally training Judo.

39:00.120 --> 39:03.240
 How do you recommend they improve Judo?

39:03.240 --> 39:06.480
 Like if I wanted to compete a bunch

39:06.480 --> 39:10.160
 and do reasonable with a particular set of throws,

39:10.160 --> 39:13.640
 say the split Saiyan Aiki,

39:13.640 --> 39:16.360
 so how do you do the Randori?

39:16.360 --> 39:18.640
 Do you use a crash pad to get in reps?

39:18.640 --> 39:20.320
 Do you, like, what do you recommend?

39:20.320 --> 39:22.920
 So I guess there's two recreational people

39:22.920 --> 39:23.760
 that we're talking about.

39:23.760 --> 39:25.880
 One is somebody who wants to learn Judo

39:25.880 --> 39:27.440
 and become good at Judo,

39:27.440 --> 39:29.680
 but doesn't necessarily want to compete,

39:29.680 --> 39:30.680
 but just wants to get better.

39:30.680 --> 39:33.480
 And I think that there's not enough emphasis

39:33.480 --> 39:36.800
 in this country on paying attention

39:36.800 --> 39:37.960
 to that type of student.

39:37.960 --> 39:40.120
 Everybody pushes them to competition.

39:40.120 --> 39:43.400
 But in reality, there's a huge audience of people out there

39:43.400 --> 39:44.880
 that would love to learn Judo

39:44.880 --> 39:46.800
 and be very proficient at Judo

39:46.800 --> 39:50.120
 and have the skills to go execute if they ever needed it.

39:50.120 --> 39:51.520
 And there's a class

39:51.520 --> 39:53.800
 and there should be a program for that athlete.

39:53.800 --> 39:56.600
 And that athlete does not need to do Randori.

39:56.600 --> 39:59.120
 Like the sport of Judo is physical enough

39:59.120 --> 40:01.000
 where you're picking somebody up all the time

40:01.000 --> 40:03.760
 and moving their body weight around the mat all the time,

40:03.760 --> 40:05.840
 where you can get very physically strong,

40:05.840 --> 40:07.400
 very physically fit.

40:07.400 --> 40:09.280
 Technically, you'll be better than somebody

40:09.280 --> 40:11.960
 that does Randori more than you

40:11.960 --> 40:14.360
 because if you learn good technique

40:14.360 --> 40:16.440
 and you learn the movement and you learn the feel

40:16.440 --> 40:18.720
 and you learn the timing,

40:18.720 --> 40:20.240
 you'll actually be a better athlete

40:20.240 --> 40:22.240
 than the person that just focuses on Randori

40:22.240 --> 40:24.760
 who does ugly technique and wins with force.

40:24.760 --> 40:28.680
 So we have a recreational class at our school

40:28.680 --> 40:30.200
 where they don't do any Randori.

40:30.200 --> 40:31.640
 They have an option afterwards

40:31.640 --> 40:33.160
 if they want to stay for 15 minutes

40:33.160 --> 40:34.120
 or stay for 30 minutes

40:34.120 --> 40:36.200
 where they can participate in Randori.

40:36.200 --> 40:39.120
 But most of the adult students choose not to

40:39.120 --> 40:42.160
 because they're already so tired from the other hour class.

40:42.160 --> 40:43.080
 It's a good workout.

40:43.080 --> 40:44.520
 Right, they're already dripping sweat.

40:44.520 --> 40:48.520
 They're already like, if you work hard and drill hard,

40:48.520 --> 40:51.400
 it's an intense workout, you're exhausted.

40:51.400 --> 40:55.800
 So that's a specific set of program,

40:55.800 --> 40:57.160
 I should say, at every academy.

40:57.160 --> 41:01.680
 And then if you want to get good and you want to compete,

41:01.680 --> 41:04.520
 then to me, once you have your techniques,

41:04.520 --> 41:09.320
 it's learning how to implement a good gripping system

41:09.320 --> 41:11.320
 to put yourself in a position

41:11.320 --> 41:14.640
 where you can always dominate the grips,

41:16.560 --> 41:19.440
 control the movement, initiate the reactions

41:19.440 --> 41:20.280
 from your opponent,

41:20.280 --> 41:22.560
 and then have the opportunity to attack and score.

41:22.560 --> 41:25.440
 And I think that when people train with,

41:25.440 --> 41:29.080
 or when they jump into a higher level of the sport of judo,

41:29.080 --> 41:32.360
 all of a sudden the first thing they say is, I can't attack.

41:32.360 --> 41:33.400
 I don't know how to attack.

41:33.400 --> 41:35.440
 Because positionally, they don't know

41:35.440 --> 41:36.440
 where to put their hands.

41:36.440 --> 41:38.800
 They don't know how to hold the gi properly.

41:38.800 --> 41:41.200
 They don't understand that they're,

41:41.200 --> 41:43.040
 they have an inferior grip,

41:43.040 --> 41:45.520
 and they don't know how to get into better positions

41:45.520 --> 41:46.360
 so they can't attack.

41:46.360 --> 41:47.600
 And that's a big part of the game

41:47.600 --> 41:49.760
 that not a lot of people really understand.

41:49.760 --> 41:52.720
 So you really, even for recreational competitors,

41:52.720 --> 41:54.880
 you really need to have a gripping system.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.200
 You need to understand the gripping system.

41:57.200 --> 41:58.880
 If you want to win.

41:58.880 --> 42:00.680
 I mean, if the goal is to go and compete,

42:00.680 --> 42:01.520
 that's a different story.

42:01.520 --> 42:03.600
 You're going, I don't have fun getting beat up

42:03.600 --> 42:04.800
 or losing in competitions.

42:04.800 --> 42:06.960
 I enjoy the...

42:06.960 --> 42:09.120
 I don't even know if it's the winning or the losing.

42:09.120 --> 42:12.080
 I don't think, I think this is what,

42:12.080 --> 42:14.320
 because I competed a lot in both Judo and Jiu Jitsu,

42:14.320 --> 42:18.120
 and in Judo, it feels like,

42:18.120 --> 42:19.960
 because I didn't have a gripping system,

42:19.960 --> 42:21.880
 it feels like you're not even playing Judo

42:21.880 --> 42:24.440
 against the good black belts.

42:24.440 --> 42:26.360
 You're, they're just, they're not,

42:26.360 --> 42:28.160
 they're not even trying because they have,

42:28.160 --> 42:29.840
 they get a certain kind of grip,

42:29.840 --> 42:31.360
 and you just can't do anything.

42:31.360 --> 42:33.120
 And I don't have a good answer for that.

42:33.120 --> 42:34.800
 I don't even know what I'm looking for.

42:34.800 --> 42:36.160
 And so it's not even fun.

42:36.160 --> 42:37.800
 It's not like even losing.

42:37.800 --> 42:40.680
 It's like, I don't know.

42:40.680 --> 42:43.480
 It's like you didn't even show up to play

42:43.480 --> 42:44.640
 is what it feels like.

42:44.640 --> 42:47.960
 And it's not, and I think that is a big gap

42:47.960 --> 42:52.880
 in knowledge, actually, in Judo schools,

42:52.880 --> 42:55.720
 is the gripping part.

42:55.720 --> 42:59.040
 When you first go out to do Judo, right?

42:59.040 --> 43:00.320
 You, the first thing you have to do

43:00.320 --> 43:01.880
 is you have to grab your opponent, right?

43:01.880 --> 43:04.040
 And a lot of times I hear coaches say, get a grip.

43:04.040 --> 43:04.880
 Just take a grip.

43:04.880 --> 43:07.280
 Well, sometimes if you take a grip,

43:07.280 --> 43:10.440
 you're in a worse position than not having a grip at all.

43:10.440 --> 43:11.960
 And that's what a lot of people don't understand.

43:11.960 --> 43:14.360
 Like if you hold the gi in the wrong way,

43:14.360 --> 43:16.920
 your opponent can attack you, but you can't attack him.

43:16.920 --> 43:19.280
 So why would you ever do that grip

43:20.400 --> 43:22.840
 if it's only to your detriment, right?

43:22.840 --> 43:26.880
 So that's, and the way you grip does set up

43:26.880 --> 43:28.360
 what attacks you can do as well.

43:28.360 --> 43:29.680
 So that is a huge part.

43:29.680 --> 43:32.720
 And I'm not saying that you have to be 100% disciplined

43:32.720 --> 43:34.480
 and only always outgrip your opponent

43:34.480 --> 43:36.160
 and only be able to do throws

43:36.160 --> 43:37.200
 when you have a superior grip.

43:37.200 --> 43:40.400
 I'm just saying that to be able to put the grips together

43:40.400 --> 43:42.200
 with the throws and understand the movements

43:42.200 --> 43:45.040
 is gonna make you that much ahead of the game.

43:45.040 --> 43:48.480
 So if we take a step to our previous discussion

43:48.480 --> 43:51.840
 of going from zero to hero.

43:51.840 --> 43:55.840
 So going from the early days through the teenage years

43:55.840 --> 43:58.560
 to winning an Olympic medal.

43:58.560 --> 44:00.920
 So we mentioned a lot of training,

44:00.920 --> 44:03.940
 the dedication of the training, the competing,

44:03.940 --> 44:05.160
 what other elements are there?

44:05.160 --> 44:07.960
 The mental side is visualization,

44:07.960 --> 44:12.680
 believing that you could perform at that level.

44:12.680 --> 44:13.760
 So what else can you say about that?

44:13.760 --> 44:15.280
 I think that comes at the highest level,

44:15.280 --> 44:17.320
 the visualization, the success,

44:17.320 --> 44:18.520
 that comes at the highest level.

44:18.520 --> 44:23.240
 I think in the teen years, there's the experience,

44:23.240 --> 44:27.360
 just plays a huge role in getting to train

44:27.360 --> 44:28.280
 with other people.

44:28.280 --> 44:30.960
 Like as Americans, we have to go train in Europe.

44:30.960 --> 44:33.240
 We have to feel the European style of judo.

44:33.240 --> 44:35.760
 You have to understand that physicality.

44:35.760 --> 44:38.080
 They grip very differently.

44:38.080 --> 44:41.160
 They put you in very unorthodox positions.

44:41.160 --> 44:43.800
 And if you don't know how to deal with that,

44:43.800 --> 44:45.480
 you get thrown before you even have a chance

44:45.480 --> 44:47.240
 to try your own throws.

44:47.240 --> 44:50.520
 So it takes a lot of that experience

44:50.520 --> 44:52.800
 and understanding what's going on.

44:52.800 --> 44:55.160
 And then you also need to get that physicality.

44:55.160 --> 44:59.260
 You need to be strong and hard, I would say,

44:59.260 --> 45:01.680
 by doing all those rounds with the Europeans.

45:01.680 --> 45:03.560
 And at the same time, you need to go to Asia

45:03.560 --> 45:05.280
 and you need to train in Japan

45:05.280 --> 45:08.740
 because you need to feel that free flowing judo

45:08.740 --> 45:10.760
 for your technical side.

45:10.760 --> 45:12.600
 And I think that's one of the things

45:12.600 --> 45:13.880
 that I was able to benefit from.

45:13.880 --> 45:15.040
 My dad was a coach who said,

45:15.040 --> 45:17.840
 ''Listen, I've taken you as far as I can take you.

45:17.840 --> 45:20.200
 ''I want you to go to the next level.''

45:20.200 --> 45:23.040
 And he sent me to England with Neil Adams,

45:23.040 --> 45:25.800
 who was an Olympic silver medalist and was a world champion,

45:25.800 --> 45:28.140
 had a great ground game and was good at gripping

45:28.140 --> 45:30.480
 and actually did Tai Otoshi, which is the throw I did.

45:30.480 --> 45:32.520
 So my dad said, ''I want you to go learn from Neil.''

45:32.520 --> 45:34.800
 And I ended up going to England

45:34.800 --> 45:36.660
 probably eight to 10 times in my career

45:36.660 --> 45:38.280
 and spending a good amount of time there

45:38.280 --> 45:40.700
 training at the Neil Adams Academy.

45:40.700 --> 45:43.040
 He's now the voice of judo, Neil Adams.

45:43.040 --> 45:43.960
 What do you make of that guy?

45:43.960 --> 45:44.920
 Just a brief pause.

45:44.920 --> 45:47.800
 He's like the, like Morgan Freeman

45:47.800 --> 45:50.200
 is the voice of like March of the Penguins

45:50.200 --> 45:52.240
 and any other nature documentary.

45:52.240 --> 45:54.880
 And Neil Adams is, there's very few sports

45:54.880 --> 45:56.400
 that have a Neil Adams, I would say,

45:56.400 --> 46:00.880
 because he's legitimately, maybe like Joe Rogan

46:00.880 --> 46:02.800
 is that from mixed martial arts.

46:02.800 --> 46:06.320
 It's just like an exceptionally recognizable voice.

46:06.320 --> 46:07.960
 He's really knowledgeable.

46:07.960 --> 46:10.520
 Also the passion is conveyed so well.

46:10.520 --> 46:13.560
 Like many times I'll watch just because he's talking.

46:13.560 --> 46:14.580
 So who is he?

46:14.580 --> 46:16.640
 Since you've gotten a chance to train with him,

46:16.640 --> 46:18.760
 to learn from him, who is Neil Adams?

46:18.760 --> 46:20.240
 He's a great friend of mine.

46:20.240 --> 46:21.080
 He is?

46:21.080 --> 46:21.900
 He's a mentor.

46:23.520 --> 46:24.960
 Like I said, I lived and trained

46:24.960 --> 46:27.680
 at the Neil Adams Club in Coventry, England

46:27.680 --> 46:29.880
 since I was like 16 years old.

46:29.880 --> 46:31.880
 I went and visited him for the first time.

46:31.880 --> 46:33.400
 He's the one who originally taught me

46:33.400 --> 46:37.320
 how to do jujigatami and the way that I do jujigatami.

46:37.320 --> 46:38.140
 I trained with him.

46:38.140 --> 46:39.480
 He was just retired.

46:39.480 --> 46:41.800
 He was in his early thirties when I first went out there.

46:41.800 --> 46:43.920
 And so I trained with him many times

46:43.920 --> 46:47.440
 and over the years he was a mentor.

46:48.600 --> 46:51.440
 Great person, cares about people,

46:51.440 --> 46:56.440
 cares about the sport of judo, had a good little club

46:56.520 --> 46:57.800
 that was a fitness club.

46:57.800 --> 47:00.880
 And it was judo, it was fitness.

47:00.880 --> 47:02.960
 It used to go there.

47:02.960 --> 47:05.280
 I'd show up at that place at like seven in the morning.

47:05.280 --> 47:07.260
 And the first thing we would do is we'd go for a run.

47:07.260 --> 47:09.300
 And we'd either be running mountains

47:09.300 --> 47:11.280
 or we'd be doing a five mile run

47:11.280 --> 47:13.120
 or we'd be doing something at the park.

47:13.120 --> 47:15.680
 We were doing sprints and buddy carries and all this stuff.

47:15.680 --> 47:18.200
 And then at 9 a.m. we'd have a technical session

47:18.200 --> 47:21.000
 with Neil Adams where he would, for an hour and a half,

47:21.000 --> 47:23.300
 we would drill techniques and learn positions.

47:23.300 --> 47:25.000
 And it was no randori.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.600
 It was that sequential drilling

47:26.600 --> 47:28.080
 that we talked about before, right?

47:28.080 --> 47:31.840
 Where you're reinforcing your two or three attacks

47:31.840 --> 47:33.000
 to set up your main attack.

47:33.000 --> 47:34.180
 Or if you're on the ground,

47:34.180 --> 47:36.900
 you're going through repetitions of certain movements.

47:38.200 --> 47:41.880
 And then I'd spend all afternoon at the club, have lunch.

47:41.880 --> 47:45.280
 I'd go do my weight training in the afternoon at that place.

47:45.280 --> 47:46.240
 And then in the evening,

47:46.240 --> 47:49.400
 we would either do randori training at the Neil Adams Club

47:49.400 --> 47:50.640
 or we would all get in a car

47:50.640 --> 47:53.760
 and we'd drive to another location

47:53.760 --> 47:55.120
 and we'd go train at another club

47:55.120 --> 47:56.240
 that might be an hour away.

47:56.240 --> 47:58.300
 And there'd be 50 bodies there to train with.

47:58.300 --> 48:00.440
 And each night we'd go to a different dojo.

48:00.440 --> 48:02.360
 And so it would be all day at the club

48:02.360 --> 48:04.680
 and I'd do that for like three weeks straight.

48:04.680 --> 48:05.800
 All we'd do was train.

48:05.800 --> 48:08.120
 Do you know how he became the voice of judo?

48:08.120 --> 48:12.700
 Do you have an understanding of what he's thinking is

48:12.700 --> 48:15.720
 around how much he dedicates to himself

48:15.720 --> 48:17.920
 to just commentating on judo?

48:17.920 --> 48:21.280
 I imagine the amount of research required,

48:21.280 --> 48:23.020
 but also just like psychologically,

48:23.020 --> 48:25.400
 just the excitement he has in his voice.

48:25.400 --> 48:28.020
 It takes work to do that.

48:28.020 --> 48:28.920
 Do you have an understanding

48:28.920 --> 48:30.960
 of like what his vision is with that?

48:30.960 --> 48:35.080
 He's always been a very charismatic, animated person, Neil.

48:35.080 --> 48:38.520
 Very passionate and loud and funny.

48:38.520 --> 48:40.100
 And the Brits are very funny to begin with.

48:40.100 --> 48:42.880
 So he's very charismatic.

48:42.880 --> 48:46.600
 But I think after coaching, he tried coaching.

48:46.600 --> 48:48.960
 He coached the country of Wales for a while.

48:48.960 --> 48:51.120
 He tried coaching stints in other countries.

48:51.120 --> 48:54.800
 He didn't have a lot of success on the coaching side

48:54.800 --> 48:56.320
 developing an Olympic champion.

48:56.320 --> 49:00.200
 I know that was a goal of his that he was a world champion.

49:00.200 --> 49:01.520
 I think it was 1981.

49:01.520 --> 49:05.600
 He won two silver medals in the Olympic games himself.

49:05.600 --> 49:07.920
 He went on to coach for a while

49:07.920 --> 49:09.820
 and had some political issues

49:09.820 --> 49:12.680
 with the country of England for a while.

49:12.680 --> 49:14.440
 And then left England and went to Wales.

49:14.440 --> 49:15.840
 And I think he had a coaching stint

49:15.840 --> 49:17.520
 somewhere else as well.

49:17.520 --> 49:20.400
 Didn't have a lot of success coaching in the sport

49:20.400 --> 49:22.120
 with athletes, not at the highest level.

49:22.120 --> 49:24.280
 Had a great national team and things like that.

49:24.280 --> 49:27.400
 He was really good at teaching his technique to others

49:27.400 --> 49:29.040
 because he helped me a lot.

49:30.640 --> 49:33.280
 But running a program, I think was difficult for him.

49:33.280 --> 49:35.760
 The boys not listening and not having that same kind

49:35.760 --> 49:37.800
 of passion and intensity that he...

49:37.800 --> 49:39.800
 And that's why I bonded well with him

49:39.800 --> 49:41.060
 because I was all in, right?

49:41.060 --> 49:43.160
 I went there and whatever he said, I did.

49:43.160 --> 49:45.640
 I didn't care how hard, I didn't care how long.

49:45.640 --> 49:47.160
 I just wanted to get as good as I could.

49:47.160 --> 49:50.160
 And so that's why he was a good mentor for me.

49:50.160 --> 49:54.680
 But now in terms of a commentator, he's very cerebral.

49:54.680 --> 49:59.340
 He loves judo, he researches it nonstop.

50:00.380 --> 50:02.120
 He's got that great voice

50:02.120 --> 50:05.560
 and he knows how to bring life to the game.

50:05.560 --> 50:06.400
 And that's what he's done.

50:06.400 --> 50:08.000
 And now this is who he is, right?

50:08.000 --> 50:11.040
 He does judo full time, this is his job.

50:11.040 --> 50:15.600
 Can I ask you a small, before we return to the actual sport,

50:15.600 --> 50:17.200
 the coaching and the sport,

50:17.200 --> 50:18.860
 it's a bit of a political question.

50:18.860 --> 50:21.080
 I did a whole rant before Travis episode.

50:23.980 --> 50:26.200
 I love Neil Adams's voice.

50:26.200 --> 50:28.000
 I love watching judo.

50:28.000 --> 50:33.000
 And it's really disappointing to me that the IOC

50:33.240 --> 50:36.660
 and whoever is responsible, I don't understand this,

50:36.660 --> 50:39.440
 that they don't make it easy for people

50:39.440 --> 50:44.080
 to watch the Olympics in replay for years after.

50:44.080 --> 50:46.320
 Like I can't watch Travis's matches.

50:46.320 --> 50:49.000
 I can't watch, like they make it very difficult

50:49.000 --> 50:51.320
 to watch stuff online.

50:51.320 --> 50:55.880
 So what happened is I uploaded the Travis Stevens episode

50:55.880 --> 50:59.200
 and we talked about his Ole Bischoff 2012 match.

50:59.200 --> 51:04.080
 And it was like one minute of like a small overlay

51:04.080 --> 51:06.760
 of the video as we're talking through it,

51:06.760 --> 51:08.080
 like stepping through it.

51:08.080 --> 51:11.760
 And it got taken down immediately from YouTube,

51:11.760 --> 51:14.300
 the whole four hour conversation

51:14.300 --> 51:16.560
 because of that one minute little clip.

51:17.640 --> 51:20.640
 And the way it got taken down automatically

51:20.640 --> 51:24.960
 is because the IOC has that video uploaded.

51:24.960 --> 51:27.360
 It's set to private, but it's uploaded.

51:27.360 --> 51:31.120
 So like they have the video and they choose not to show it.

51:31.120 --> 51:33.280
 It's not that they're asking for money or whatever.

51:33.280 --> 51:35.340
 They're just not showing it anywhere.

51:35.340 --> 51:37.560
 They're not showing it through their own service.

51:37.560 --> 51:39.720
 Like an NBC Olympics or so on.

51:39.720 --> 51:42.120
 There's just so many great human stories

51:42.120 --> 51:44.120
 that the Olympics reveals.

51:44.120 --> 51:46.760
 They're just not made easily accessible.

51:46.760 --> 51:50.420
 That's the Olympics charter is you want to,

51:50.420 --> 51:54.840
 I think the actual line is to ensure the fullest coverage

51:54.840 --> 51:57.280
 and the widest possible audience in the world

51:57.280 --> 51:58.800
 for the Olympic games.

51:58.800 --> 52:02.440
 And it seems like to me as a fan of the Olympic games,

52:02.440 --> 52:04.160
 we're not getting any of that.

52:04.160 --> 52:08.040
 Do you have an understanding of why that is?

52:08.040 --> 52:10.640
 Like why we can't watch Kayla's matches,

52:10.640 --> 52:12.520
 Travis's matches super easily,

52:12.520 --> 52:14.920
 even if we're willing to pay money for it.

52:14.920 --> 52:17.760
 So you can't go on the International Judo Federation

52:17.760 --> 52:20.520
 website right now and watch any of the Olympic footage?

52:20.520 --> 52:22.680
 No, no, no.

52:23.940 --> 52:26.960
 So the only thing they have is for certain,

52:26.960 --> 52:30.000
 for example, Teddy Rene match he lost.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.120
 Not available anywhere.

52:31.120 --> 52:31.960
 Really?

52:31.960 --> 52:33.580
 And that's like a dramatic thing.

52:33.580 --> 52:36.760
 So the one thing they have is for certain sports

52:36.760 --> 52:39.140
 at the highest level, like gymnastics,

52:39.140 --> 52:40.520
 they'll have a highlight,

52:40.520 --> 52:43.620
 which is the most frustrating thing to me.

52:43.620 --> 52:46.080
 Because this is what I can't,

52:46.080 --> 52:50.100
 I'm going to try to prevent myself from going on a rant.

52:50.100 --> 52:55.100
 But people don't just want to see a two minute highlight

52:56.600 --> 52:58.560
 of a historic moment.

52:58.560 --> 53:01.400
 They want to see the buildup where the athlete is standing,

53:01.400 --> 53:04.120
 the nerves, the fear, the confidence.

53:04.120 --> 53:06.080
 You see the buildup to the event,

53:06.080 --> 53:09.160
 say it's a gymnastic, whatever, floor routine.

53:09.160 --> 53:11.800
 Like their name is announced, they're walking,

53:11.800 --> 53:13.800
 the coat, then they cut to the coach,

53:13.800 --> 53:15.640
 and the coach with anticipation,

53:15.640 --> 53:16.800
 and then go to the athlete.

53:16.800 --> 53:18.720
 You want the full 10 minute thing.

53:18.720 --> 53:20.760
 You don't want a two minute highlight

53:20.760 --> 53:23.360
 of what happened like last second or whatever.

53:23.360 --> 53:28.240
 It's just like the magic of that full story.

53:28.240 --> 53:32.400
 Like a lifetime building up to those 10 minutes, right?

53:32.400 --> 53:34.320
 That's the magic of the Olympics.

53:34.320 --> 53:36.080
 The both the drama and the triumph

53:36.080 --> 53:37.500
 that happens in those moments.

53:37.500 --> 53:39.660
 And the fact that you can't relive that.

53:41.080 --> 53:43.400
 Like Travis had a bunch of those, right?

53:43.400 --> 53:46.920
 Like he had a bunch of times he faced like world champions,

53:46.920 --> 53:49.880
 he won and lost, and just, it's always close,

53:49.880 --> 53:51.760
 it's always dramatic.

53:51.760 --> 53:54.240
 And none of those are available except like

53:54.240 --> 53:59.240
 maybe the one where he beat Armbard,

53:59.600 --> 54:01.880
 or whatever the submission was, I forgot.

54:01.880 --> 54:04.960
 The choke, yeah, the Georgian.

54:04.960 --> 54:07.360
 But most things are not.

54:07.360 --> 54:09.920
 Usain Bolt, the full races,

54:09.920 --> 54:12.220
 not all of his races are available online.

54:13.160 --> 54:18.160
 The race with the Italian winning the 100 meter track race,

54:19.640 --> 54:22.400
 this Olympics is not only highlight is available

54:22.400 --> 54:24.440
 from what I saw, I didn't look too hard.

54:24.440 --> 54:28.240
 So like, but the fact that it's not super easily accessible

54:28.240 --> 54:29.760
 if you're willing to pay money even,

54:29.760 --> 54:33.040
 but probably should be for free, is heartbreaking to me.

54:33.040 --> 54:38.040
 Because to me, the Olympics is like some of the best

54:38.380 --> 54:40.120
 of humanity.

54:40.120 --> 54:43.280
 Just like, again, the hardship they have to overcome.

54:43.280 --> 54:45.480
 So like the losses are really powerful.

54:45.480 --> 54:46.760
 Because it's such heartbreak,

54:46.760 --> 54:49.400
 but it's also like the triumph.

54:49.400 --> 54:50.640
 Where you're losing history.

54:50.640 --> 54:52.480
 You're losing history is what you are,

54:52.480 --> 54:55.760
 of all the magical moments of your sport, right?

54:55.760 --> 54:57.380
 It's a sin.

54:58.600 --> 55:03.600
 I got to blame it on television rights and money.

55:03.940 --> 55:04.780
 That's what it comes down to.

55:04.780 --> 55:06.480
 It's like billions and billions of dollars

55:06.480 --> 55:10.260
 of television rights paid by NBC here in the United States

55:10.260 --> 55:13.020
 and globally, whatever the main carriers are

55:13.020 --> 55:16.080
 and all the other nations that are dictating

55:16.080 --> 55:17.960
 what can be replayed and what can't.

55:17.960 --> 55:20.200
 And that's what it comes down to.

55:20.200 --> 55:25.200
 I made a DVD or a video when I first retired

55:25.720 --> 55:26.560
 from the sport.

55:26.560 --> 55:27.400
 It was called Fury on the Mat.

55:27.400 --> 55:28.780
 It was kind of my story, right?

55:28.780 --> 55:32.440
 And I did it with a friend who was a videographer

55:32.440 --> 55:34.720
 and we grabbed a bunch of my old footage

55:34.720 --> 55:38.060
 and Olympic footage and somebody said to me,

55:38.060 --> 55:39.920
 you can't use that Olympic footage.

55:39.920 --> 55:41.840
 And I was young and I had just retired.

55:41.840 --> 55:43.280
 I said, what do you mean I can't use the Olympic footage?

55:43.280 --> 55:45.360
 It's not the television footage.

55:45.360 --> 55:47.520
 It's my buddy who filmed it with his own camera.

55:47.520 --> 55:48.360
 It's my footage.

55:48.360 --> 55:49.200
 Yeah, exactly.

55:49.200 --> 55:51.240
 And then they said, no, if it has Olympics in it

55:51.240 --> 55:52.960
 or it's anything to do with the Olympics,

55:52.960 --> 55:54.640
 the USOC owns it.

55:54.640 --> 55:55.460
 Yeah.

55:55.460 --> 55:56.300
 I said, okay, well, they said,

55:56.300 --> 55:57.680
 well, you should get to send it to them

55:57.680 --> 56:00.280
 and let them review it.

56:00.280 --> 56:02.640
 So I sent it to them and I got a bill back.

56:02.640 --> 56:03.920
 I got a thing back that said,

56:03.920 --> 56:05.040
 if you want to use this footage,

56:05.040 --> 56:06.880
 it's going to be like $30,000.

56:06.880 --> 56:09.200
 And I said, man, it's only like three minutes.

56:09.200 --> 56:11.120
 I spliced it up as much as I could

56:11.120 --> 56:13.240
 and I only have highlights in there.

56:13.240 --> 56:14.080
 And then I said, come on.

56:14.080 --> 56:17.360
 I went back and I negotiated with them.

56:17.360 --> 56:18.200
 But at the end of the day,

56:18.200 --> 56:20.440
 I still had to pay like $15,000

56:20.440 --> 56:23.720
 just to have a few minutes of footage in my own film.

56:23.720 --> 56:25.320
 This is...

56:25.320 --> 56:27.040
 And I'm thinking, you wouldn't even have that film

56:27.040 --> 56:28.120
 if I didn't compete in it.

56:28.120 --> 56:30.200
 You know, like you can't, you know.

56:30.200 --> 56:31.920
 So it was a struggle.

56:31.920 --> 56:32.760
 This is the different,

56:32.760 --> 56:34.760
 like you have the same in Jiu Jitsu.

56:34.760 --> 56:37.760
 There's certain organizations, IBJJF

56:37.760 --> 56:40.040
 or like Flow Grappling and Flow Wrestling.

56:40.040 --> 56:43.040
 I understand, I think when it's a business,

56:43.040 --> 56:44.620
 it might make sense.

56:44.620 --> 56:46.240
 First of all, you should actually be good

56:46.240 --> 56:48.160
 at being a business and making money,

56:48.160 --> 56:51.080
 which is why for me, the IOC doesn't make sense.

56:51.080 --> 56:54.320
 Like it should be accessible, but it would cost money.

56:56.320 --> 56:57.560
 I can't buy it.

56:57.560 --> 57:00.240
 Like would I have to email them for this footage

57:00.240 --> 57:01.080
 and pay $30,000?

57:01.080 --> 57:02.040
 Yeah, yeah.

57:02.040 --> 57:04.840
 No, but the question is,

57:04.840 --> 57:06.220
 like the way you run a business

57:06.220 --> 57:08.200
 is you make that frictionless.

57:08.200 --> 57:11.040
 Whatever the money is, $30,000 or $30,

57:11.040 --> 57:13.840
 you make it frictionless and easy to pay that money.

57:13.840 --> 57:17.000
 But anyway, I understand why that might be the case

57:17.000 --> 57:18.400
 with Flow Grappling,

57:18.400 --> 57:21.020
 but to me, the Olympics is a special thing.

57:21.020 --> 57:21.860
 For sure.

57:21.860 --> 57:23.880
 It's like, like you said, it is history.

57:23.880 --> 57:25.160
 Like there's not even,

57:25.160 --> 57:27.920
 like even the world championships don't compare.

57:27.920 --> 57:30.180
 I understand they're really important,

57:30.180 --> 57:32.080
 but Olympics is history.

57:32.080 --> 57:37.080
 And the stories should certainly belong to the athletes

57:37.160 --> 57:39.840
 if they want to do like Fury on the Mat

57:39.840 --> 57:41.480
 to do their own story,

57:41.480 --> 57:46.120
 or like on a podcast to talk about the most tragic moment

57:46.120 --> 57:47.260
 of their career.

57:49.660 --> 57:53.060
 Do you have a sense of how that could be fixed or no?

57:54.720 --> 57:56.640
 The only thing I could think of is,

57:56.640 --> 57:58.320
 you'd have to go to the Olympic committee.

57:58.320 --> 58:00.800
 The US Olympic committee is the place I would start

58:00.800 --> 58:02.940
 because the US controls the worldwide market

58:02.940 --> 58:04.600
 when it comes to television.

58:04.600 --> 58:06.280
 We pay the most for our television rights.

58:06.280 --> 58:09.860
 Our sponsors pay the most for their rights

58:09.860 --> 58:12.000
 to be associated with the best team in the world,

58:12.000 --> 58:13.220
 which is the United States, right?

58:13.220 --> 58:15.240
 So all the money starts here.

58:16.180 --> 58:18.900
 I gotta believe there has to be a way to get that footage

58:18.900 --> 58:22.440
 that should be accessible to the sports themselves.

58:22.440 --> 58:23.560
 I'm surprised it's not,

58:23.560 --> 58:27.360
 but if it's not, then it's because of dollars.

58:27.360 --> 58:28.600
 It's because people aren't,

58:28.600 --> 58:31.440
 the sport itself is not willing to pay enough money

58:31.440 --> 58:35.720
 to have it on its, accessible to its audience.

58:35.720 --> 58:38.660
 It's too cost prohibitive for them to do it.

58:38.660 --> 58:40.760
 No, but I think it's also, unfortunately,

58:40.760 --> 58:43.080
 might be some mixture of incompetence

58:43.080 --> 58:45.160
 and just an old way of doing things

58:45.160 --> 58:48.400
 because there's a lot of money to be made

58:48.400 --> 58:52.880
 on television rights where you live show the event, right?

58:52.880 --> 58:56.600
 But what's not being leveraged is the huge amount of money

58:56.600 --> 58:58.040
 that could be made on the replay.

58:58.040 --> 59:00.800
 This is what people don't understand is,

59:00.800 --> 59:05.000
 do you know how many times, just the tens of millions

59:05.000 --> 59:10.000
 of times that people watch individual events years from now?

59:10.360 --> 59:12.640
 You watch like all the videos on YouTube,

59:12.640 --> 59:14.200
 they're still getting plays.

59:14.200 --> 59:16.200
 Hundreds of millions of views on stuff

59:16.200 --> 59:18.620
 that happened 10 years ago, 15 years ago.

59:18.620 --> 59:20.920
 That's really powerful and there's a lot of opportunity

59:20.920 --> 59:22.320
 to make a ton of money.

59:22.320 --> 59:25.500
 So it's not that they're necessarily greedy.

59:25.500 --> 59:28.000
 They're also just not good at being greedy.

59:28.000 --> 59:28.840
 I get what you're saying.

59:28.840 --> 59:30.160
 Yeah, it's not the tradition.

59:30.160 --> 59:32.220
 Think about it though, it's not traditional, right?

59:32.220 --> 59:35.800
 For television studios, it's nontraditional

59:35.800 --> 59:40.280
 to go to online streaming, to online access to information.

59:40.280 --> 59:41.260
 It's not hard, right?

59:41.260 --> 59:45.120
 Because everybody's doing it now, but it's not typical.

59:45.120 --> 59:49.020
 Yeah, so it requires for the IOC

59:49.020 --> 59:51.400
 to operate outside their comfort zone.

59:51.400 --> 59:53.280
 Well, I definitely hope that's the case.

59:53.280 --> 59:58.280
 And since Travis's video got taken down,

59:59.320 --> 1:00:00.440
 it's obvious they have it.

1:00:00.440 --> 1:00:02.520
 They have it on their YouTube channel.

1:00:02.520 --> 1:00:07.520
 So it's like, I hope that they will just release it.

1:00:07.520 --> 1:00:10.600
 And for money, for whatever, but release it

1:00:10.600 --> 1:00:15.600
 and have that history not be erased, right?

1:00:16.320 --> 1:00:19.080
 It'd be wonderful if athletes could buy.

1:00:19.080 --> 1:00:20.340
 Even if you could buy your own footage,

1:00:20.340 --> 1:00:22.060
 you can't use it commercially, you can't,

1:00:22.060 --> 1:00:24.160
 but you can buy your own matches

1:00:24.160 --> 1:00:25.820
 and have them available for yourself

1:00:25.820 --> 1:00:30.820
 or package the footage, it'd be awesome.

1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:32.440
 Thank you for that.

1:00:32.440 --> 1:00:34.240
 That is quite heartbreaking for me,

1:00:34.240 --> 1:00:36.460
 so I wanted to talk about it a little bit.

1:00:37.960 --> 1:00:41.440
 Let's go to you as an athlete real quick.

1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:42.280
 Sure.

1:00:42.280 --> 1:00:45.720
 You represented the United States at four Olympics,

1:00:45.720 --> 1:00:48.040
 winning a bronze medal at two of them.

1:00:49.160 --> 1:00:53.520
 Who or what was the toughest match or moment

1:00:53.520 --> 1:00:55.240
 you had in those years?

1:00:55.240 --> 1:00:58.560
 Maybe a moment that defined you,

1:00:58.560 --> 1:00:59.760
 that you remember as being

1:00:59.760 --> 1:01:03.400
 particularly defining in your career.

1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:11.320
 I would say the bronze medal match in Atlanta in 96,

1:01:11.660 --> 1:01:13.080
 because up to that moment,

1:01:13.080 --> 1:01:15.680
 the United States team had not won a medal,

1:01:15.680 --> 1:01:18.560
 had not fought for a medal in the games.

1:01:18.560 --> 1:01:20.240
 We were on our home turf.

1:01:20.240 --> 1:01:22.240
 It was my second Olympic games, right?

1:01:22.240 --> 1:01:25.040
 So I had competed in 92 and I had won two matches

1:01:25.040 --> 1:01:28.540
 and lost in the third round in Barcelona.

1:01:28.540 --> 1:01:29.680
 I didn't make the podium.

1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:31.700
 I lost to a Japanese guy from Japan.

1:01:33.800 --> 1:01:36.060
 But the gold, silver, and bronze medalist

1:01:36.060 --> 1:01:39.520
 at that Olympics in Barcelona were all guys that I had beat.

1:01:39.520 --> 1:01:41.680
 In fact, two of them I was undefeated against

1:01:41.680 --> 1:01:42.520
 in my entire career,

1:01:42.520 --> 1:01:45.200
 the Brazilian and the Cuban I had never lost to.

1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:48.360
 So that's when I knew I was capable of being

1:01:48.360 --> 1:01:50.440
 on the podium at the Olympic games.

1:01:50.440 --> 1:01:53.680
 When 96 came around, I was 25 years old.

1:01:53.680 --> 1:01:55.240
 I was fairly in my prime.

1:01:55.240 --> 1:01:56.880
 I had lived in Japan for six months.

1:01:56.880 --> 1:01:58.740
 My technique was at a high level.

1:01:59.680 --> 1:02:02.180
 I was amongst the best in the world.

1:02:04.320 --> 1:02:07.880
 I lost at that Olympics to a guy from Mongolia.

1:02:07.880 --> 1:02:09.320
 It was right before the match

1:02:09.320 --> 1:02:10.800
 I was supposed to fight against Japan.

1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:13.360
 So I was anticipating the match against Japan

1:02:13.360 --> 1:02:15.720
 and I got beat by the Mongolian.

1:02:15.720 --> 1:02:16.940
 So that was kind of a letdown.

1:02:16.940 --> 1:02:21.940
 But the match for the bronze in front of the hometown crowd,

1:02:21.940 --> 1:02:24.300
 all of my family, all of my friends,

1:02:24.300 --> 1:02:27.820
 everybody who had ever helped me in the sport

1:02:27.820 --> 1:02:29.340
 were in the stands that day,

1:02:29.340 --> 1:02:31.720
 including all my teammates at Brown University

1:02:31.720 --> 1:02:32.940
 that were on the wrestling team

1:02:32.940 --> 1:02:35.460
 and little, my uncles, my aunts,

1:02:35.460 --> 1:02:37.660
 everybody was in the stands, right?

1:02:37.660 --> 1:02:39.920
 So it was like the Jimmy Pedro day.

1:02:39.920 --> 1:02:42.660
 And I'm getting goosebumps right now talking about it.

1:02:44.060 --> 1:02:46.260
 But it was a match against the Brazilian

1:02:46.260 --> 1:02:47.200
 for the bronze medal.

1:02:47.200 --> 1:02:49.240
 I had beaten the Brazilian like two or three times

1:02:49.240 --> 1:02:50.080
 before that.

1:02:50.080 --> 1:02:54.080
 And I found myself down in the match.

1:02:54.080 --> 1:02:55.360
 He actually countered me.

1:02:56.240 --> 1:02:58.320
 I came in my Taiyo Toshi and he was waiting for it

1:02:58.320 --> 1:03:00.840
 and he counted me and he scored a yuko against me.

1:03:00.840 --> 1:03:02.640
 So I was losing the fight,

1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:05.280
 came down to about the last minute in the match

1:03:05.280 --> 1:03:06.960
 and I was just tucking in my gi

1:03:06.960 --> 1:03:09.920
 and fixing my thing and gathering my thoughts together.

1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:12.580
 And the whole crowd just started chanting,

1:03:12.580 --> 1:03:16.320
 USA, USA, USA.

1:03:16.320 --> 1:03:18.620
 And I like literally like got so much energy.

1:03:18.620 --> 1:03:20.720
 I walked out there, I grabbed the guy,

1:03:20.720 --> 1:03:22.280
 I came in my Taiyo Toshi again.

1:03:22.280 --> 1:03:24.160
 He stepped off the Taiyo Toshi.

1:03:24.160 --> 1:03:26.600
 I threw him with duchimada for Ippon.

1:03:26.600 --> 1:03:29.320
 I won my first Olympic medal

1:03:29.320 --> 1:03:31.700
 in front of the hometown crowd.

1:03:31.700 --> 1:03:33.840
 Everybody went bananas.

1:03:33.840 --> 1:03:36.560
 The United States judo team had our first medal

1:03:36.560 --> 1:03:37.840
 from the Olympics.

1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:39.680
 It ended up being the only Olympic medal

1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:41.080
 we won at that games.

1:03:41.080 --> 1:03:44.440
 But it was like a magical moment that defined my career

1:03:44.440 --> 1:03:46.920
 and solidified myself in like history where,

1:03:46.920 --> 1:03:49.360
 hey, now I get to step up on the Olympic podium

1:03:49.360 --> 1:03:50.760
 and I'm Olympic medalist.

1:03:50.760 --> 1:03:53.660
 And to me, that was my defining moment.

1:03:53.660 --> 1:03:55.840
 And after that, I was sold.

1:03:55.840 --> 1:03:57.860
 Like man, I had to go back to the Olympics again.

1:03:57.860 --> 1:03:58.960
 I wanna win a gold medal.

1:03:58.960 --> 1:04:01.680
 I want this feeling all over again.

1:04:01.680 --> 1:04:05.040
 I don't care if I have to wait four years, let's do it.

1:04:05.040 --> 1:04:08.480
 In your career, like moments like that,

1:04:08.480 --> 1:04:13.480
 do you think you love winning or hate losing more?

1:04:13.480 --> 1:04:17.840
 So do you live for those moments

1:04:17.840 --> 1:04:22.840
 or are you more driven by just how much you hate losing?

1:04:24.340 --> 1:04:26.340
 So in order to be a champion,

1:04:26.340 --> 1:04:29.400
 my belief is that you have to hate losing

1:04:29.400 --> 1:04:31.280
 more than you like winning.

1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:33.600
 Hate losing more than you like winning.

1:04:33.600 --> 1:04:36.840
 But I live for those moments when you do win.

1:04:36.840 --> 1:04:39.080
 And what excited me the most in my career

1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:44.080
 when I was competing was I loved being in the finals.

1:04:44.320 --> 1:04:46.440
 I loved the spotlight being on me.

1:04:46.440 --> 1:04:48.920
 I can't think of too many times in my career,

1:04:48.920 --> 1:04:50.360
 of course there were a few,

1:04:50.360 --> 1:04:54.120
 but there weren't too many times where the chips were down,

1:04:54.120 --> 1:04:56.840
 like the lights were on and I didn't win.

1:04:56.840 --> 1:05:00.000
 Like it was, I might've lost early in the day

1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:01.280
 and didn't make it to the finals

1:05:01.280 --> 1:05:02.860
 or didn't make it to the medal rounds.

1:05:02.860 --> 1:05:06.320
 But like in my career, I have a ton of golds.

1:05:06.320 --> 1:05:07.840
 I have a ton of bronzes,

1:05:07.840 --> 1:05:11.600
 which means the lights are on and I won

1:05:11.600 --> 1:05:15.000
 and I have very few silvers and very few fifths.

1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:16.600
 So I either lost in the early rounds

1:05:16.600 --> 1:05:18.560
 and didn't make it to the medal rounds in my younger days

1:05:18.560 --> 1:05:21.640
 or the spotlight came and I really shined.

1:05:21.640 --> 1:05:23.560
 Cause if you look, I don't know how many silvers,

1:05:23.560 --> 1:05:25.560
 but there wasn't very many silver medals in my career

1:05:25.560 --> 1:05:26.560
 that I won.

1:05:26.560 --> 1:05:27.400
 You know what I mean?

1:05:27.400 --> 1:05:29.000
 So I just loved that moment.

1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:30.240
 I didn't feel pressure.

1:05:30.240 --> 1:05:31.720
 I loved the crowd.

1:05:31.720 --> 1:05:33.400
 I loved being in the spotlight.

1:05:33.400 --> 1:05:36.200
 I didn't have, I wasn't nervous when it came to the finals

1:05:36.200 --> 1:05:37.840
 or I knew I was getting a medal.

1:05:37.840 --> 1:05:38.960
 It didn't matter.

1:05:38.960 --> 1:05:40.760
 You know, so it was just me against the other guy

1:05:40.760 --> 1:05:42.360
 and that's how I always saw it.

1:05:42.360 --> 1:05:44.200
 And I just loved that moment.

1:05:44.200 --> 1:05:45.880
 So your dad was your coach.

1:05:45.880 --> 1:05:46.720
 Yeah.

1:05:48.880 --> 1:05:50.120
 You didn't get to meet him tonight.

1:05:50.120 --> 1:05:51.000
 Oh, great.

1:05:54.080 --> 1:05:56.080
 He's kind of a legend in the sport.

1:05:56.080 --> 1:05:59.180
 So how has your dad helped you as a coach,

1:05:59.180 --> 1:06:02.360
 as an athlete, as a human being throughout the years?

1:06:02.360 --> 1:06:06.360
 Number one, my dad is the most brutally honest person

1:06:06.360 --> 1:06:08.360
 you will ever meet in your life.

1:06:08.360 --> 1:06:09.360
 Brutally honest.

1:06:09.360 --> 1:06:12.400
 He will tell you, if you are fat,

1:06:12.400 --> 1:06:14.560
 he will tell you you're fat, right, to your face.

1:06:14.560 --> 1:06:15.400
 He wants you to get better.

1:06:15.400 --> 1:06:16.720
 He wants you to be healthy.

1:06:16.720 --> 1:06:17.560
 Yeah.

1:06:17.560 --> 1:06:18.640
 Doesn't want you to die of obesity.

1:06:18.640 --> 1:06:20.080
 It's just the way he is.

1:06:20.080 --> 1:06:23.680
 If you didn't do well, he will not sugarcoat it.

1:06:23.680 --> 1:06:26.080
 He will let you know what you didn't do right.

1:06:26.080 --> 1:06:28.000
 So he's the ultimate litmus test.

1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:28.840
 Yes.

1:06:28.840 --> 1:06:29.680
 Right?

1:06:29.680 --> 1:06:34.680
 Second is, he is the most passionate, caring, deep,

1:06:37.240 --> 1:06:41.020
 always thinking about, very cerebral,

1:06:41.020 --> 1:06:44.740
 very like a student of the game,

1:06:44.740 --> 1:06:49.260
 somebody who helped me immensely in defining my strategy,

1:06:49.260 --> 1:06:53.540
 helping me improve, and always look for what's next.

1:06:53.540 --> 1:06:58.100
 Third, in terms of training,

1:06:58.100 --> 1:07:02.180
 I think that he's probably the most brilliant human

1:07:02.180 --> 1:07:06.580
 when it comes to preparing an athlete physically,

1:07:06.580 --> 1:07:10.060
 not necessarily mentally, physically, for success.

1:07:10.060 --> 1:07:11.460
 When all the chips are down,

1:07:11.460 --> 1:07:12.900
 that athlete will be ready that day,

1:07:12.900 --> 1:07:15.860
 and he has a system of training and preparing

1:07:15.860 --> 1:07:18.860
 and getting the athlete to peak for performance.

1:07:18.860 --> 1:07:20.900
 You mean like conditioning, like the whole thing?

1:07:20.900 --> 1:07:21.920
 Yes.

1:07:21.920 --> 1:07:26.920
 Okay, because I vaguely remember Kayla Harrison

1:07:27.860 --> 1:07:31.020
 talking about her preparation being very difficult.

1:07:31.020 --> 1:07:31.860
 Yeah.

1:07:31.860 --> 1:07:33.320
 That's it.

1:07:33.320 --> 1:07:34.160
 That's him.

1:07:34.160 --> 1:07:35.660
 Yeah, that's him.

1:07:35.660 --> 1:07:38.420
 At the same, you go back and ask Ronda Rousey

1:07:38.420 --> 1:07:39.440
 about her career, right?

1:07:39.440 --> 1:07:41.320
 My dad was her coach.

1:07:41.320 --> 1:07:45.880
 My dad moved her to Camp New Hampshire in Boston,

1:07:45.880 --> 1:07:48.160
 got her up, ran her in the morning,

1:07:48.160 --> 1:07:50.700
 had her downstairs in the basement of his house,

1:07:50.700 --> 1:07:51.680
 training with the weights.

1:07:51.680 --> 1:07:52.960
 We brought a Russian girl in.

1:07:52.960 --> 1:07:54.980
 She did throws on his cement outside

1:07:54.980 --> 1:07:55.820
 with the little crash pad.

1:07:55.820 --> 1:07:56.660
 Nice.

1:07:56.660 --> 1:07:59.300
 Threw the Russian girl a hundred times that morning,

1:07:59.300 --> 1:08:02.020
 and then every night came to Boston,

1:08:02.020 --> 1:08:03.380
 to the training center in Wakefield,

1:08:03.380 --> 1:08:05.660
 trained at night, and went back and slept at my dad's house,

1:08:05.660 --> 1:08:09.300
 and three weeks straight before she went off to Beijing.

1:08:09.300 --> 1:08:11.100
 And he did the same with Kayla.

1:08:11.100 --> 1:08:12.400
 He did the same with me.

1:08:14.500 --> 1:08:17.460
 His passion is producing athletes at the highest level,

1:08:17.460 --> 1:08:18.800
 and he knows how to do it.

1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:22.260
 And then the one side of my dad's

1:08:23.860 --> 1:08:26.220
 coaching where I think there's a flaw or a weakness

1:08:26.220 --> 1:08:28.320
 is on the mental preparation side of the game.

1:08:28.320 --> 1:08:29.880
 He wasn't somebody that was,

1:08:30.840 --> 1:08:32.480
 I don't know if he,

1:08:32.480 --> 1:08:34.940
 maybe because he wasn't an Olympic champion himself

1:08:34.940 --> 1:08:36.240
 and wasn't a world champion,

1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:39.820
 he lacked the confidence in helping others be more confident.

1:08:39.820 --> 1:08:41.680
 So he's more of a,

1:08:41.680 --> 1:08:43.580
 this is what you need to work on type of thing.

1:08:43.580 --> 1:08:46.240
 He doesn't know how to build the athletes up

1:08:46.240 --> 1:08:48.260
 to make them feel invincible.

1:08:48.260 --> 1:08:49.380
 And I feel like that's something

1:08:49.380 --> 1:08:51.300
 that I was able to give all of the athletes,

1:08:51.300 --> 1:08:55.060
 to help them with that visualization, belief in yourself,

1:08:55.060 --> 1:08:56.140
 knowing that you're gonna win

1:08:56.140 --> 1:08:57.260
 before you step out of the mat,

1:08:57.260 --> 1:09:00.020
 knowing that we've earned the right to victory,

1:09:00.020 --> 1:09:02.260
 seeing success in your mind,

1:09:02.260 --> 1:09:05.300
 having a positive mantra that you,

1:09:05.300 --> 1:09:07.380
 I'm the best in the world, nobody's beating me today,

1:09:07.380 --> 1:09:09.080
 type of feeling.

1:09:09.080 --> 1:09:10.980
 So you go out there feeling like King Kong

1:09:10.980 --> 1:09:12.380
 when you step on the mat,

1:09:12.380 --> 1:09:14.420
 that nobody's gonna stop you.

1:09:14.420 --> 1:09:17.960
 And so I think the combination of both of us as coaches,

1:09:17.960 --> 1:09:20.260
 I'm a lot more technical.

1:09:20.260 --> 1:09:21.900
 My dad is good at letting,

1:09:21.900 --> 1:09:24.820
 identifying what they need to do for their techniques

1:09:24.820 --> 1:09:28.420
 and what, in strategy, how to beat opponents

1:09:28.420 --> 1:09:30.780
 and putting game plans together.

1:09:30.780 --> 1:09:33.760
 So combined, the two of us made an unbelievable team.

1:09:33.760 --> 1:09:36.420
 So he's not gonna let the athlete be soft

1:09:36.420 --> 1:09:39.340
 when they enter the highest,

1:09:39.340 --> 1:09:43.580
 the most difficult competitions of their career.

1:09:43.580 --> 1:09:48.100
 So on the mental side, what's mental preparation look like?

1:09:48.100 --> 1:09:50.820
 Like how many years before the Olympics

1:09:50.820 --> 1:09:54.060
 do you start helping an athlete believe

1:09:54.060 --> 1:09:57.460
 that they can win an Olympic medal?

1:09:57.460 --> 1:09:58.980
 Well, I think it's gotta be a seed

1:09:58.980 --> 1:10:02.260
 in that athlete's brain, something they wanna do, right?

1:10:02.260 --> 1:10:05.700
 Nobody can quickly get there, right?

1:10:05.700 --> 1:10:06.740
 It's a long process.

1:10:06.740 --> 1:10:09.220
 But if your goal, if you're national champion

1:10:09.220 --> 1:10:10.940
 or you've proven yourself to win

1:10:10.940 --> 1:10:13.260
 in some international tournaments,

1:10:13.260 --> 1:10:15.420
 and you think the Olympics is a possibility for you,

1:10:15.420 --> 1:10:19.140
 then defining it as, hey, I wanna be on the Olympic team,

1:10:19.140 --> 1:10:24.140
 that would be the first step into getting ready.

1:10:24.180 --> 1:10:28.340
 And I always make them put it on paper.

1:10:28.340 --> 1:10:29.580
 If it really is your goal,

1:10:29.580 --> 1:10:30.880
 then you show me that it's your goal

1:10:30.880 --> 1:10:32.940
 and put it on paper and commit to it.

1:10:32.940 --> 1:10:34.100
 I wanna be Olympic medalist,

1:10:34.100 --> 1:10:35.060
 I wanna be Olympic champion,

1:10:35.060 --> 1:10:36.540
 I wanna go to the Olympics.

1:10:36.540 --> 1:10:38.900
 World team member, maybe junior world team member,

1:10:38.900 --> 1:10:41.700
 whatever it is, we walk before we go to the highest level.

1:10:41.700 --> 1:10:44.340
 But if the goal is to go to the Olympics,

1:10:44.340 --> 1:10:46.860
 let's accomplish these other things first, right?

1:10:46.860 --> 1:10:50.260
 Because if we can accomplish these other things,

1:10:50.260 --> 1:10:52.580
 then we're on our way to getting to the ultimate goal,

1:10:52.580 --> 1:10:54.140
 which is the Olympics.

1:10:54.140 --> 1:10:56.300
 For somebody like Kayla, for example,

1:10:58.500 --> 1:11:02.180
 she didn't say that she wanted to be Olympic champion

1:11:02.180 --> 1:11:05.300
 when she first came here in 2005, right?

1:11:05.300 --> 1:11:07.820
 We wanted to become national champion,

1:11:07.820 --> 1:11:09.260
 then we wanted to be on the world team,

1:11:09.260 --> 1:11:10.980
 then we wanted to be a world medalist.

1:11:10.980 --> 1:11:12.860
 Then our sights were set on the Olympics

1:11:12.860 --> 1:11:14.540
 or the Olympic gold.

1:11:14.540 --> 1:11:17.100
 So it's having those clearly defined goals

1:11:17.100 --> 1:11:18.100
 that are attainable.

1:11:18.100 --> 1:11:20.940
 Like they should be a reach, they should be a stretch,

1:11:20.940 --> 1:11:22.700
 but they have to be attainable.

1:11:22.700 --> 1:11:24.300
 They can't be just a pipe dream.

1:11:25.300 --> 1:11:30.060
 But once you put it to paper and you think it's achievable,

1:11:30.060 --> 1:11:33.020
 then it's mapping the plan to get there.

1:11:33.020 --> 1:11:36.860
 Is there a daily process of visualizing yourself

1:11:36.860 --> 1:11:40.020
 as an Olympic champion or national champion?

1:11:40.020 --> 1:11:43.060
 Yes, it is, and you should do it

1:11:43.060 --> 1:11:45.180
 either every night before you go to bed

1:11:45.180 --> 1:11:48.660
 or before every training session

1:11:48.660 --> 1:11:50.100
 or after every training session.

1:11:50.100 --> 1:11:51.660
 One of those three times it should,

1:11:51.660 --> 1:11:54.020
 or first thing you wake up in the morning,

1:11:54.020 --> 1:11:55.580
 because it may be to help some people,

1:11:55.580 --> 1:11:57.700
 it motivates them to go do what it is

1:11:57.700 --> 1:11:59.340
 they're supposed to do in the day.

1:12:00.820 --> 1:12:04.620
 But the process of visualization is, to me,

1:12:04.620 --> 1:12:07.540
 is closing your eyes for a few moments.

1:12:07.540 --> 1:12:09.820
 Your brain works really, really fast, right?

1:12:09.820 --> 1:12:14.580
 And it's actually picturing the day in its entirety,

1:12:14.580 --> 1:12:16.100
 from start to finish,

1:12:16.100 --> 1:12:19.260
 from the moment you wake up and you step on the scale

1:12:19.260 --> 1:12:20.540
 to the moment you have your breakfast

1:12:20.540 --> 1:12:22.300
 and you go through your morning routine.

1:12:22.300 --> 1:12:24.980
 Like live the day that you're gonna have at the Olympics.

1:12:24.980 --> 1:12:26.180
 So whatever it is you're trying to do,

1:12:26.180 --> 1:12:28.180
 let's say the Olympic day, for example.

1:12:29.300 --> 1:12:31.020
 Picture yourself making weight,

1:12:31.020 --> 1:12:33.900
 picture yourself, who you're around, eating your breakfast,

1:12:33.900 --> 1:12:35.980
 having maybe saying a few jokes, laughing.

1:12:35.980 --> 1:12:38.100
 This is a real day, make it real.

1:12:38.100 --> 1:12:42.780
 Going back and packing your judo bag for the day,

1:12:42.780 --> 1:12:45.820
 getting on the bus, driving to the venue,

1:12:45.820 --> 1:12:49.420
 feel what it's like walking into the stadium

1:12:49.420 --> 1:12:52.060
 for the first time, going to the warmup area,

1:12:52.060 --> 1:12:54.620
 seeing your drawer up on the sheet,

1:12:54.620 --> 1:12:56.660
 who you're gonna fight that day,

1:12:56.660 --> 1:12:59.740
 watching yourself warm up, go through your warmup routine,

1:13:00.940 --> 1:13:03.500
 walking out of the shoot, into the venue,

1:13:03.500 --> 1:13:05.380
 going to do that first fight.

1:13:05.380 --> 1:13:07.420
 Picture the moment of throwing your opponent,

1:13:07.420 --> 1:13:10.700
 coming off the mat, high fiving the coach,

1:13:10.700 --> 1:13:12.420
 getting ready for your second fight.

1:13:12.420 --> 1:13:15.380
 Like live the day from start to finish

1:13:15.380 --> 1:13:17.260
 and make it as real as possible.

1:13:18.100 --> 1:13:20.860
 We're all the way to the moment where you've just won

1:13:20.860 --> 1:13:23.380
 and you're raising your arms in celebration,

1:13:23.380 --> 1:13:25.860
 you're bowing, you're hugging your opponent,

1:13:25.860 --> 1:13:28.700
 you come off the mat, you hug your coach,

1:13:28.700 --> 1:13:31.700
 you're running around the stadium with the flag,

1:13:31.700 --> 1:13:34.700
 you stepped up on the podium, you heard your name,

1:13:34.700 --> 1:13:36.860
 Olympic champion, Jimmy Pedro,

1:13:36.860 --> 1:13:39.020
 like you heard the moment,

1:13:39.020 --> 1:13:41.900
 the medal being put around your neck,

1:13:41.900 --> 1:13:44.940
 picture the people coming up on the podium with you,

1:13:44.940 --> 1:13:47.260
 arms around them, taking the pictures.

1:13:47.260 --> 1:13:50.900
 Like the more real you can make it,

1:13:50.900 --> 1:13:53.660
 even before it ever happens, right?

1:13:54.660 --> 1:13:56.820
 When you do that enough times,

1:13:57.700 --> 1:14:01.660
 I feel that like pathways get created for you

1:14:01.660 --> 1:14:04.900
 so that when your body gets to that moment,

1:14:04.900 --> 1:14:06.700
 and I've been here before, this is it,

1:14:06.700 --> 1:14:08.900
 this is my moment, this is what I pictured my whole life,

1:14:08.900 --> 1:14:11.100
 I'm not nervous, because I've seen this,

1:14:11.100 --> 1:14:13.900
 this is gonna happen, I believe it's possible, right?

1:14:13.900 --> 1:14:15.900
 And I believe the athletes that do that

1:14:15.900 --> 1:14:19.620
 and make it real enough that when they get to that moment,

1:14:19.620 --> 1:14:22.700
 they go right through, there's no hesitation.

1:14:22.700 --> 1:14:25.340
 This is what this is meant to be, this is my destiny,

1:14:25.340 --> 1:14:27.540
 this is why I did everything I did,

1:14:27.540 --> 1:14:29.980
 versus the ones that don't think about it ever,

1:14:29.980 --> 1:14:34.020
 but just kind of like hope, it's not real to them,

1:14:34.020 --> 1:14:35.420
 it doesn't feel attainable,

1:14:35.420 --> 1:14:36.740
 they don't believe it's possible,

1:14:36.740 --> 1:14:39.940
 they haven't committed to believing it was possible.

1:14:39.940 --> 1:14:42.780
 Without that commitment in yourself and that belief,

1:14:42.780 --> 1:14:43.940
 it can't happen.

1:14:43.940 --> 1:14:48.340
 And one thing that, I talked to Travis a bit about this,

1:14:48.340 --> 1:14:51.180
 you probably worked with him on the details

1:14:51.180 --> 1:14:52.740
 of what you're talking about,

1:14:52.740 --> 1:14:55.180
 but he said that you should really

1:14:56.900 --> 1:15:01.260
 focus on visualizing the sensations you feel.

1:15:01.260 --> 1:15:04.660
 So say if you're drinking coffee or something like that,

1:15:04.660 --> 1:15:08.900
 you're not thinking about like observing yourself

1:15:08.900 --> 1:15:11.140
 from a third person perspective drinking coffee,

1:15:11.140 --> 1:15:15.460
 like you're thinking of how your hand will feel

1:15:15.460 --> 1:15:17.140
 when it touches something warm.

1:15:17.140 --> 1:15:20.020
 Like you try to replay the actual sensations

1:15:20.020 --> 1:15:21.660
 you would feel, right?

1:15:21.660 --> 1:15:24.980
 So it sounds kind of strange,

1:15:24.980 --> 1:15:27.820
 but meaning like you really wanna put yourself in the body

1:15:27.820 --> 1:15:30.420
 as you would experience those moments,

1:15:30.420 --> 1:15:33.140
 as opposed to like watching yourself on TV

1:15:33.140 --> 1:15:36.420
 experience in those moments, like really be inside.

1:15:36.420 --> 1:15:38.220
 And yeah, so that means sensations,

1:15:38.220 --> 1:15:40.460
 like how does it feel when you grip a gi?

1:15:40.460 --> 1:15:45.180
 How does it, yeah, the sweating,

1:15:45.180 --> 1:15:47.140
 just the sensation of sweat,

1:15:47.140 --> 1:15:50.020
 like rolling down your forehead or whatever,

1:15:50.020 --> 1:15:52.500
 like all of those actual feelings.

1:15:52.500 --> 1:15:54.100
 When I explain it to you,

1:15:54.100 --> 1:15:57.660
 like I guess my body has been through it so many times,

1:15:57.660 --> 1:15:59.340
 both in my mind and in reality

1:15:59.340 --> 1:16:03.060
 that it brings back all of those same emotions.

1:16:03.060 --> 1:16:06.580
 I start to get goosebumps, my armpits start to sweat,

1:16:06.580 --> 1:16:09.180
 like I'm living it if it's real.

1:16:09.180 --> 1:16:10.500
 I'm reliving it now.

1:16:10.500 --> 1:16:14.220
 But when you're going through the visualization process,

1:16:14.220 --> 1:16:16.700
 it has to be that real, the smells,

1:16:16.700 --> 1:16:18.740
 the taping of the fingers,

1:16:18.740 --> 1:16:23.220
 like the more colorful and the more real you can make it,

1:16:23.220 --> 1:16:25.500
 the more believable it is.

1:16:25.500 --> 1:16:27.700
 So I've been doing this kind of thing,

1:16:27.700 --> 1:16:30.540
 just having listened to you enough

1:16:30.540 --> 1:16:34.180
 for other stuff in life, so let's see if it works.

1:16:35.140 --> 1:16:37.140
 But do you see this kind of visualization

1:16:37.140 --> 1:16:40.060
 being useful for other things in career

1:16:40.060 --> 1:16:40.900
 and all those kinds of things?

1:16:40.900 --> 1:16:45.900
 100%, 100%, because I just know with my own life,

1:16:46.380 --> 1:16:50.860
 my own experiences, like my wife sometimes says to me,

1:16:50.860 --> 1:16:52.500
 she says, well, where do you see yourself

1:16:52.500 --> 1:16:55.460
 in like five years from now?

1:16:55.460 --> 1:16:58.820
 And five years ago, I had said to her,

1:16:58.820 --> 1:17:00.460
 I wanna have my own business.

1:17:00.460 --> 1:17:03.700
 I wanna have, this is the amount of money

1:17:03.700 --> 1:17:05.540
 that I'm hoping I can make in a given year.

1:17:05.540 --> 1:17:06.900
 Like you have to have goals for yourself.

1:17:06.900 --> 1:17:08.900
 Like is this, if you put out there like,

1:17:08.900 --> 1:17:11.860
 okay, I wanna make a million dollars in a year.

1:17:11.860 --> 1:17:13.060
 That's a big number.

1:17:13.060 --> 1:17:15.340
 Like for me or for the normal person,

1:17:15.340 --> 1:17:16.860
 like that's a really big number.

1:17:16.860 --> 1:17:17.700
 You know what I mean?

1:17:17.700 --> 1:17:19.620
 Like it's not, especially when you're not making

1:17:19.620 --> 1:17:22.740
 that much at the time, it's a super big number, right?

1:17:22.740 --> 1:17:24.380
 So having those goals for yourself,

1:17:24.380 --> 1:17:27.660
 like it won't happen and it's not possible

1:17:27.660 --> 1:17:30.300
 unless you dream it's possible

1:17:30.300 --> 1:17:31.780
 and think that it's possible.

1:17:31.780 --> 1:17:34.060
 And then it doesn't magically happen.

1:17:34.060 --> 1:17:35.900
 And maybe it doesn't happen in five years,

1:17:35.900 --> 1:17:37.180
 maybe it happens in 10,

1:17:37.180 --> 1:17:39.820
 but at least you're on the path to getting there.

1:17:39.820 --> 1:17:40.660
 You know what I mean?

1:17:40.660 --> 1:17:41.860
 And I said, I wanna own my own business.

1:17:41.860 --> 1:17:44.300
 I wanna control my own destiny.

1:17:44.300 --> 1:17:46.060
 I wanna be my own boss.

1:17:46.060 --> 1:17:47.820
 I wanna make my own decisions.

1:17:47.820 --> 1:17:49.980
 Like these are the things that I told her I wanted to do.

1:17:49.980 --> 1:17:53.180
 And now I'm at that point,

1:17:53.180 --> 1:17:55.260
 where I work for myself,

1:17:55.260 --> 1:17:57.420
 I have my own company, I have partners obviously,

1:17:57.420 --> 1:18:00.460
 but like if I wanna pick up and go somewhere for a week,

1:18:00.460 --> 1:18:03.180
 I just do, I don't have to ask permission to do it, right?

1:18:03.180 --> 1:18:05.060
 That's what life, freedom, right?

1:18:05.060 --> 1:18:06.780
 That's what I'd like.

1:18:06.780 --> 1:18:09.100
 And all of it starts with a dream.

1:18:09.100 --> 1:18:12.740
 In the same with my dojo, when I first opened.

1:18:12.740 --> 1:18:14.780
 So I ran a dojo for a long time

1:18:14.780 --> 1:18:16.540
 and I only had 60 students always,

1:18:16.540 --> 1:18:18.860
 like 40 to 60 students had fluctuated.

1:18:19.860 --> 1:18:20.700
 And I sit there and say,

1:18:20.700 --> 1:18:23.260
 why can't I get more people in my door, right?

1:18:23.260 --> 1:18:25.300
 So I hired consultants to come in

1:18:25.300 --> 1:18:27.580
 and look at my business and say why, right?

1:18:27.580 --> 1:18:29.620
 And they came in and said,

1:18:29.620 --> 1:18:31.420
 well, this place is really intimidating.

1:18:31.420 --> 1:18:33.100
 Like if I was coming in off the street,

1:18:33.100 --> 1:18:35.300
 the first thing I see is this big Olympic champion

1:18:35.300 --> 1:18:37.780
 on the wall and I see this training that's going on

1:18:37.780 --> 1:18:40.140
 and these guys are flying through the air and landing hard.

1:18:40.140 --> 1:18:41.780
 And as a white belt, you're telling me

1:18:41.780 --> 1:18:42.840
 that's the class for me?

1:18:42.840 --> 1:18:44.580
 Like no way, I'm not gonna do that.

1:18:44.580 --> 1:18:47.620
 So like I listened to these people and I said, you're right.

1:18:47.620 --> 1:18:51.140
 And the training was hour and a half, two hours long.

1:18:51.140 --> 1:18:53.300
 People can't handle an hour and a half or two hours training

1:18:53.300 --> 1:18:54.260
 when they're first walking in the door.

1:18:54.260 --> 1:18:56.980
 So I had to restructure all my programming.

1:18:56.980 --> 1:19:00.260
 I had to look at the way I was offering my school

1:19:00.260 --> 1:19:02.900
 and I had to make levels for everybody, right?

1:19:02.900 --> 1:19:05.620
 Like here's my four to six year old class.

1:19:05.620 --> 1:19:07.780
 Here's my six to 13 year old class.

1:19:07.780 --> 1:19:09.860
 There's all my beginner classes.

1:19:09.860 --> 1:19:11.660
 They don't mix in with the advanced people.

1:19:11.660 --> 1:19:16.660
 And I had to learn how to make it accessible for everybody

1:19:16.660 --> 1:19:19.580
 instead of just the people that wanted to train hard.

1:19:19.580 --> 1:19:22.180
 And then the challenge was, okay,

1:19:22.180 --> 1:19:25.020
 if you can have a lot of people in your dojo training,

1:19:25.020 --> 1:19:26.140
 it's a recreational school.

1:19:26.140 --> 1:19:28.340
 You can't produce champions at that same school.

1:19:28.340 --> 1:19:29.780
 That's what I was told.

1:19:29.780 --> 1:19:31.740
 So then I got all my black belts together

1:19:31.740 --> 1:19:33.660
 and I said, listen, this is my vision.

1:19:33.660 --> 1:19:34.860
 This is what I want.

1:19:34.860 --> 1:19:38.220
 I wanna have a club that has over 200 judo only athletes,

1:19:38.220 --> 1:19:41.780
 no jujitsu, no karate, nothing, judo only.

1:19:41.780 --> 1:19:43.820
 I want over 200 people.

1:19:43.820 --> 1:19:46.700
 And in the inside of that dojo, I wanna have Olympic

1:19:46.700 --> 1:19:49.060
 champions and I wanna have recreational,

1:19:49.060 --> 1:19:51.260
 like little kids, five and six years old,

1:19:51.260 --> 1:19:53.820
 older guys in their seventies train, I don't care,

1:19:53.820 --> 1:19:55.660
 but I want the spectrum of recreational

1:19:55.660 --> 1:19:57.260
 and I want Olympic champions.

1:19:57.260 --> 1:20:00.420
 The only way to do that is to take your instructors

1:20:00.420 --> 1:20:03.340
 and say, you're gonna do this, define the roles,

1:20:03.340 --> 1:20:04.820
 who's gonna be the recreational coach,

1:20:04.820 --> 1:20:06.260
 who's gonna be the competitive coach.

1:20:06.260 --> 1:20:08.620
 How do we separate these programs?

1:20:08.620 --> 1:20:10.740
 And lo and behold, that was my vision that I shared

1:20:10.740 --> 1:20:15.020
 with all of them and that was back in 2006.

1:20:15.900 --> 1:20:19.820
 And by 2012, we've got Olympic champion Kayla Harrison,

1:20:19.820 --> 1:20:21.940
 we have over 200 people at the school,

1:20:21.940 --> 1:20:24.260
 we have a successful thriving business,

1:20:24.260 --> 1:20:26.780
 but it doesn't happen without that vision,

1:20:26.780 --> 1:20:30.460
 a plan and believing that it's possible.

1:20:30.460 --> 1:20:32.500
 Believing that it's possible.

1:20:32.500 --> 1:20:36.700
 I don't know, but I personally have on top of that

1:20:36.700 --> 1:20:41.700
 almost like very specific visions of a future.

1:20:41.860 --> 1:20:44.660
 Like, I don't know what,

1:20:44.660 --> 1:20:46.700
 cause I don't wanna give actual examples.

1:20:46.700 --> 1:20:51.700
 Cause for several reasons, one of which is just people

1:20:51.700 --> 1:20:56.100
 will, as they often have, they often will in your life,

1:20:56.100 --> 1:20:59.380
 they'll just laugh at it a little bit,

1:20:59.380 --> 1:21:00.820
 like that seems silly.

1:21:02.260 --> 1:21:05.300
 And I don't, I'm very hesitant to share certain things

1:21:05.300 --> 1:21:07.140
 like that with people because they'll,

1:21:08.500 --> 1:21:12.660
 I mean, I'm with Johnny Ive, who's the lead designer

1:21:12.660 --> 1:21:16.460
 in Apple, like you want that dream, that little flame

1:21:16.460 --> 1:21:19.660
 to not, people will put that flame out too easily,

1:21:19.660 --> 1:21:21.500
 even people that love you.

1:21:21.500 --> 1:21:24.820
 So I have very specific kind of visions,

1:21:26.820 --> 1:21:30.820
 like maybe for Travis, it would be like a specific opponent

1:21:30.820 --> 1:21:34.220
 or something like Ole Bischoff, like very specific,

1:21:34.220 --> 1:21:36.820
 very specific situation of what's going to happen.

1:21:36.820 --> 1:21:39.220
 Not just like, I wanna be an Olympic champion,

1:21:39.220 --> 1:21:43.100
 but very specific, like almost silly situations.

1:21:43.100 --> 1:21:45.220
 Yeah, like the dynamic between Travis

1:21:45.220 --> 1:21:47.740
 and Ole Bischoff or something, like maybe visualize that.

1:21:47.740 --> 1:21:50.980
 For me, that helps because it makes it all real,

1:21:50.980 --> 1:21:52.340
 even more real.

1:21:52.340 --> 1:21:55.500
 It's not like some big goal, like a million dollars

1:21:55.500 --> 1:21:58.060
 or something like that, which is also really important

1:21:58.060 --> 1:22:00.180
 to have because you can measure it and so on.

1:22:00.180 --> 1:22:05.180
 But it's just like you belong in those situations.

1:22:05.580 --> 1:22:08.900
 Just believing you belong there.

1:22:08.900 --> 1:22:09.740
 It's not the default.

1:22:09.740 --> 1:22:10.580
 It can be you.

1:22:10.580 --> 1:22:11.740
 Yeah, it could be you.

1:22:11.740 --> 1:22:13.620
 And for some reason, that really helps me,

1:22:13.620 --> 1:22:15.100
 the little details.

1:22:15.100 --> 1:22:15.940
 Sure.

1:22:15.940 --> 1:22:18.740
 Like visualizing, most of them are almost

1:22:18.740 --> 1:22:23.260
 a little bit funny, like focusing on the funniness.

1:22:23.260 --> 1:22:28.060
 It's the mundaneness of it helps me a lot.

1:22:28.060 --> 1:22:30.220
 And all the people that have done great things,

1:22:30.220 --> 1:22:31.820
 they're just human too.

1:22:31.820 --> 1:22:36.060
 Correct, and I think a lot of people overestimate

1:22:36.060 --> 1:22:41.060
 who others are and sell themselves too short.

1:22:42.300 --> 1:22:45.060
 Because at the end of the day, everybody started

1:22:45.980 --> 1:22:47.420
 like everybody else, really.

1:22:47.420 --> 1:22:49.340
 I mean, we did.

1:22:49.340 --> 1:22:50.180
 We're all infants.

1:22:50.180 --> 1:22:51.660
 We couldn't walk, we couldn't talk,

1:22:51.660 --> 1:22:52.500
 we couldn't do anything.

1:22:52.500 --> 1:22:54.300
 We learned along the way.

1:22:54.300 --> 1:22:57.620
 And I think that's the one thing that I realized is that,

1:22:57.620 --> 1:23:00.100
 and I tell this to my athletes,

1:23:00.100 --> 1:23:03.340
 but I also tell it to my recreational students,

1:23:03.340 --> 1:23:06.980
 nobody is better than you are, nobody,

1:23:06.980 --> 1:23:08.540
 unless you allow them to be.

1:23:09.540 --> 1:23:11.580
 If you really want something to happen,

1:23:11.580 --> 1:23:16.420
 then like map the plan, believe in yourself,

1:23:16.420 --> 1:23:20.700
 decide, and know full out, you're gonna fail a lot.

1:23:20.700 --> 1:23:22.340
 You're gonna get beat down.

1:23:22.340 --> 1:23:23.620
 You're gonna have losses.

1:23:23.620 --> 1:23:25.540
 You're gonna have struggles.

1:23:25.540 --> 1:23:27.260
 And I think that's the one thing with social media today

1:23:27.260 --> 1:23:30.620
 is that everybody sees everybody succeed.

1:23:30.620 --> 1:23:32.300
 Nobody posts the picture when they're on the ground

1:23:32.300 --> 1:23:33.740
 and fail, you're losing.

1:23:33.740 --> 1:23:36.140
 Like nobody sees when you broke your arm

1:23:36.140 --> 1:23:37.780
 and you had to go through rehab,

1:23:37.780 --> 1:23:39.580
 whatever it is, like had your injuries

1:23:39.580 --> 1:23:41.460
 and you were on your couch watching TV

1:23:41.460 --> 1:23:43.500
 and you were suffering and you were like,

1:23:43.500 --> 1:23:47.020
 everybody has really, really dark, bad moments in their life

1:23:47.020 --> 1:23:50.260
 and defeats and losses and suffrage.

1:23:50.260 --> 1:23:53.180
 And it's only at the end after they've recovered

1:23:53.180 --> 1:23:55.420
 from all of that, they've reclimbed up the mountain

1:23:55.420 --> 1:23:56.660
 and they've gone to the pinnacle

1:23:56.660 --> 1:23:59.780
 that you see them on social media with the medal, right?

1:23:59.780 --> 1:24:03.140
 But everybody else like struggles and was human

1:24:03.140 --> 1:24:05.300
 and failed many, many times.

1:24:05.300 --> 1:24:10.300
 And convincing yourself that you're capable,

1:24:10.380 --> 1:24:12.620
 I think is the first start of everything.

1:24:12.620 --> 1:24:15.580
 Do you need people in your life that believe in you

1:24:15.580 --> 1:24:19.020
 or should most of it come from within yourself?

1:24:19.020 --> 1:24:21.060
 I think most of it has to come in from,

1:24:21.060 --> 1:24:25.540
 it certainly helps, but it has to come from you first.

1:24:25.540 --> 1:24:28.940
 You have to be driven, like other people can help you

1:24:28.940 --> 1:24:31.500
 define where you wanna go and help you get there

1:24:31.500 --> 1:24:33.940
 and encourage you and can support you

1:24:33.940 --> 1:24:37.940
 and whether it's resource wise or with connections

1:24:37.940 --> 1:24:39.780
 and like they can help with that path,

1:24:39.780 --> 1:24:42.780
 but that first part has to come from you.

1:24:42.780 --> 1:24:45.620
 It has to be your passion, your desire,

1:24:45.620 --> 1:24:48.380
 your commitment to yourself.

1:24:48.380 --> 1:24:49.980
 You're the one that's gonna ultimately make

1:24:49.980 --> 1:24:51.820
 all the sacrifices to do it.

1:24:51.820 --> 1:24:54.460
 So it has to be your decision, not your parents,

1:24:54.460 --> 1:24:56.620
 not your spouses, something that you're

1:24:56.620 --> 1:24:57.980
 really motivated to do.

1:24:59.340 --> 1:25:01.340
 Let me ask you about Travis, Kayla,

1:25:01.340 --> 1:25:03.260
 and maybe a few of the other athletes

1:25:03.260 --> 1:25:04.100
 you've been involved with.

1:25:04.100 --> 1:25:05.380
 So first, Travis.

1:25:06.580 --> 1:25:11.580
 Travis Stevens, Olympic silver medalist,

1:25:11.820 --> 1:25:16.820
 three time Olympian, 2008, 2012, 2016.

1:25:17.140 --> 1:25:20.300
 What makes Travis Stevens great?

1:25:20.300 --> 1:25:23.060
 What makes him so successful?

1:25:23.060 --> 1:25:25.740
 What makes him unique in your mind as an athlete?

1:25:26.660 --> 1:25:29.820
 Through all the hardship he had to overcome,

1:25:29.820 --> 1:25:32.580
 through his weird looking sayonagi

1:25:32.580 --> 1:25:36.180
 that eventually worked out nicely,

1:25:36.180 --> 1:25:39.020
 through the full richness of his personality,

1:25:39.020 --> 1:25:41.140
 in the context of all the other great athletes

1:25:41.140 --> 1:25:43.140
 you've coached, what makes him special?

1:25:45.460 --> 1:25:48.220
 His fight, Travis has fight.

1:25:48.220 --> 1:25:50.700
 And you know, the first time I ever saw Travis Stevens

1:25:50.700 --> 1:25:54.220
 was in, like recognized him, maybe I had seen him before

1:25:54.220 --> 1:25:55.340
 as a younger boy or something,

1:25:55.340 --> 1:25:57.860
 but like actually recognized him as,

1:25:57.860 --> 1:26:00.940
 I brought a group of young kids to Italy

1:26:00.940 --> 1:26:03.140
 for a competition in a training camp.

1:26:03.140 --> 1:26:06.220
 And it was this program called U23 Elite.

1:26:06.220 --> 1:26:10.780
 And I picked, handpicked 20 kids to go to this event.

1:26:10.780 --> 1:26:14.260
 And it was the first time I coached an international team.

1:26:15.140 --> 1:26:17.060
 And I had never seen Travis fight before,

1:26:17.060 --> 1:26:18.820
 compete, train, anything.

1:26:18.820 --> 1:26:21.500
 And during this competition, you know,

1:26:21.500 --> 1:26:22.860
 he's an 81 kilo player.

1:26:22.860 --> 1:26:27.860
 I think he was maybe like 18 years old, 17, 18 years old.

1:26:28.100 --> 1:26:31.140
 And it was a really hard European event.

1:26:31.140 --> 1:26:34.820
 And I think Travis won three matches and he lost two.

1:26:34.820 --> 1:26:37.260
 But what stood out the most to me was like,

1:26:37.260 --> 1:26:39.220
 the fight he had in him.

1:26:39.220 --> 1:26:41.260
 He was scrapping every fight.

1:26:41.260 --> 1:26:42.580
 Like he scrapped hard.

1:26:42.580 --> 1:26:45.140
 Like he wanted to win more than any of them, right?

1:26:45.140 --> 1:26:47.380
 He didn't win, but he wanted to win more.

1:26:47.380 --> 1:26:49.700
 And I noticed that right away.

1:26:49.700 --> 1:26:52.620
 And then I also noticed that after he lost his second match

1:26:52.620 --> 1:26:54.380
 and he was eliminated from the tournament,

1:26:54.380 --> 1:26:57.020
 I saw how disappointed he was in himself.

1:26:57.020 --> 1:26:58.740
 Like he actually thought he was supposed

1:26:58.740 --> 1:26:59.820
 to beat those people.

1:26:59.820 --> 1:27:01.860
 Even though he was like 17, right?

1:27:01.860 --> 1:27:03.660
 And he's fighting against grown men that are,

1:27:03.660 --> 1:27:06.220
 you know, a high level judo, much higher than he was.

1:27:06.220 --> 1:27:07.260
 And I said to him, I said,

1:27:07.260 --> 1:27:09.740
 hey son, like, don't worry, man.

1:27:09.740 --> 1:27:11.180
 You got a long career ahead of you.

1:27:11.180 --> 1:27:13.580
 Like, I'm glad you're disappointed,

1:27:13.580 --> 1:27:15.700
 but there's so many things you don't know

1:27:15.700 --> 1:27:17.660
 and so many skills you don't have.

1:27:17.660 --> 1:27:19.500
 The fact that you were able to hold your own

1:27:19.500 --> 1:27:21.860
 and scrap like that, like you've got a good future.

1:27:21.860 --> 1:27:24.900
 And I remember calling my friend, Jason Morris,

1:27:24.900 --> 1:27:26.460
 after that tournament.

1:27:26.460 --> 1:27:27.300
 And I said, hey man,

1:27:27.300 --> 1:27:29.780
 did you ever hear of this kid, Travis Stevens?

1:27:29.780 --> 1:27:30.860
 He says, no, why?

1:27:30.860 --> 1:27:33.020
 I said, man, that kid's got some fight in him, right?

1:27:33.020 --> 1:27:35.740
 And I said that, I said that to Jason at the time.

1:27:35.740 --> 1:27:37.220
 I said, that kid's got some fight in him, man.

1:27:37.220 --> 1:27:38.940
 He's pretty talented, you know?

1:27:38.940 --> 1:27:40.220
 And that's how it started.

1:27:41.340 --> 1:27:43.420
 But so I saw that in him when he was young.

1:27:43.420 --> 1:27:46.260
 But the other thing was, Travis,

1:27:46.260 --> 1:27:50.380
 like, there's no such thing as hard work to that guy.

1:27:50.380 --> 1:27:52.420
 If you tell him to put his head through the wall

1:27:52.420 --> 1:27:53.900
 and that's how he wins,

1:27:53.900 --> 1:27:55.180
 he'll go put his head through the wall.

1:27:55.180 --> 1:28:00.180
 He'll do whatever it takes for him to do to achieve success.

1:28:00.980 --> 1:28:05.980
 And he hates failure more than he likes winning, 100%.

1:28:08.140 --> 1:28:08.980
 He always has.

1:28:08.980 --> 1:28:11.100
 He punishes himself when he doesn't do well.

1:28:11.100 --> 1:28:12.620
 He makes himself work harder.

1:28:12.620 --> 1:28:17.620
 He goes and just abuses himself when he doesn't succeed

1:28:19.060 --> 1:28:22.220
 because he's so heartbroken and disappointed in himself.

1:28:22.220 --> 1:28:24.900
 So that's a trait that I think all of the athletes

1:28:24.900 --> 1:28:28.940
 that I work with closely, they all had that same trait.

1:28:28.940 --> 1:28:30.860
 They hated losing more than anything.

1:28:30.860 --> 1:28:31.900
 They would break their arm.

1:28:31.900 --> 1:28:33.580
 They'd fall on their head.

1:28:33.580 --> 1:28:36.860
 They'd rather get hit by a car than lose a judo tournament.

1:28:36.860 --> 1:28:39.300
 And as a result, then they all had fight

1:28:39.300 --> 1:28:40.780
 and they all were willing to train.

1:28:40.780 --> 1:28:42.140
 They were willing to listen.

1:28:42.140 --> 1:28:44.620
 They would do anything for victory.

1:28:44.620 --> 1:28:47.380
 Within the rules, I'm not talking about taking drugs

1:28:47.380 --> 1:28:48.220
 or anything like that,

1:28:48.220 --> 1:28:52.660
 but they'd give 100% of themselves for victory.

1:28:52.660 --> 1:28:56.020
 And Travis was somebody that when he was down,

1:28:56.020 --> 1:28:58.660
 he found a way to get better doing something else.

1:28:58.660 --> 1:29:01.500
 If he couldn't do standing, that's when he started jujitsu.

1:29:01.500 --> 1:29:03.100
 He couldn't go on his feet anymore.

1:29:03.100 --> 1:29:04.820
 He couldn't stand up and train.

1:29:04.820 --> 1:29:06.380
 Might as well go learn jujitsu

1:29:06.380 --> 1:29:09.300
 and get good on the ground because I can.

1:29:09.300 --> 1:29:11.780
 So he always found a way no matter what obstacle

1:29:11.780 --> 1:29:14.260
 was in his way, he just went around it.

1:29:14.260 --> 1:29:18.100
 So what about, it'd be interesting to get your perspective

1:29:18.100 --> 1:29:19.940
 because I know Travis's perspective

1:29:19.940 --> 1:29:24.180
 is just the number of injuries.

1:29:24.180 --> 1:29:26.380
 Like what do you make of the perseverance

1:29:26.380 --> 1:29:28.780
 through all the injuries he had to overcome?

1:29:28.780 --> 1:29:31.820
 Specifically like you just observing this creature

1:29:31.820 --> 1:29:33.420
 that you've coached.

1:29:33.420 --> 1:29:37.180
 I mean, he seems to not see the injuries as a problem.

1:29:37.180 --> 1:29:40.740
 He just like, just like you said, head through the wall.

1:29:40.740 --> 1:29:44.780
 It's like what, like when we were talking about injuries,

1:29:44.780 --> 1:29:48.460
 he kinda, he doesn't even see the injuries themselves

1:29:48.460 --> 1:29:51.860
 as the problem because he thinks that the injuries,

1:29:51.860 --> 1:29:53.700
 you know, you heal back stronger.

1:29:54.500 --> 1:29:57.220
 I forget the exact quote, but he said like,

1:29:57.220 --> 1:30:02.220
 my body is now less injury prone than most of anyone else.

1:30:02.860 --> 1:30:03.700
 Because I've already broken everything.

1:30:03.700 --> 1:30:07.260
 I've broken everything and it's just grown back stronger.

1:30:07.260 --> 1:30:08.580
 Like, cause I asked him something like,

1:30:08.580 --> 1:30:10.940
 do you regret sort of pushing your body

1:30:10.940 --> 1:30:15.060
 to all of those places that resulted in those injuries?

1:30:15.060 --> 1:30:19.500
 He was, his response was like, no, I'm stronger now.

1:30:19.500 --> 1:30:21.860
 So I don't know if that's justification,

1:30:21.860 --> 1:30:24.700
 but that certainly describes a mindset that,

1:30:24.700 --> 1:30:26.420
 yeah, head through the wall.

1:30:26.420 --> 1:30:30.620
 That doesn't, it's almost not dramatic.

1:30:30.620 --> 1:30:32.460
 Like, look, I got this injury.

1:30:32.460 --> 1:30:35.220
 It's so, I'm so like brave and special

1:30:35.220 --> 1:30:36.380
 for overcoming this injury.

1:30:36.380 --> 1:30:39.900
 He's just, he's just, that's part of the job

1:30:39.900 --> 1:30:41.580
 and he gets the job done.

1:30:41.580 --> 1:30:44.380
 But like that job involves a lot of injuries.

1:30:44.380 --> 1:30:46.780
 One of the talks I gave Travis and that team

1:30:46.780 --> 1:30:49.940
 at that particular tournament was at the very beginning

1:30:49.940 --> 1:30:52.540
 of the camp after the tournament, I said to them, listen,

1:30:52.540 --> 1:30:54.620
 my vision, I shared my vision with them.

1:30:54.620 --> 1:30:57.940
 I said, my vision is, you know, in seven years,

1:30:57.940 --> 1:31:00.740
 cause that was 2005, I said in seven years,

1:31:00.740 --> 1:31:04.340
 I wanna have a US team that steps on the mat

1:31:04.340 --> 1:31:06.300
 that is ready to kick ass.

1:31:06.300 --> 1:31:07.980
 And in order to get there,

1:31:07.980 --> 1:31:09.820
 all of you guys can be a part of this team

1:31:09.820 --> 1:31:10.820
 and part of this process.

1:31:10.820 --> 1:31:12.340
 But in order to get there,

1:31:12.340 --> 1:31:14.420
 you guys have to be the first ones to practice.

1:31:14.420 --> 1:31:15.900
 You have to be the last ones to leave

1:31:15.900 --> 1:31:18.740
 cause we have to work harder than the rest of the world

1:31:18.740 --> 1:31:20.620
 because we're up against all odds.

1:31:20.620 --> 1:31:24.220
 I said, I am sick of America being a laughing stock of judo

1:31:24.220 --> 1:31:26.740
 and being the first round, easy match,

1:31:26.740 --> 1:31:28.780
 warmup for everybody else.

1:31:28.780 --> 1:31:30.820
 I said, if you get injured,

1:31:30.820 --> 1:31:33.580
 you're not gonna be on the side with, you know,

1:31:33.580 --> 1:31:36.140
 with a ice bag on taking off rounds.

1:31:36.140 --> 1:31:37.900
 And then get back on the mat the next day

1:31:37.900 --> 1:31:39.100
 and tell me you're okay.

1:31:39.100 --> 1:31:41.340
 If you can train the next day, you can train today.

1:31:41.340 --> 1:31:42.220
 So there's no injury.

1:31:42.220 --> 1:31:44.160
 The only time you'll leave in this dojo

1:31:44.160 --> 1:31:46.580
 is if the ambulance has to take you out of here.

1:31:46.580 --> 1:31:48.940
 You know, and I do think subliminally,

1:31:48.940 --> 1:31:53.100
 Travis bought into that message and heard that message then,

1:31:53.100 --> 1:31:54.340
 said, if I'm gonna be a champion,

1:31:54.340 --> 1:31:55.620
 that's the way I'm gonna do it.

1:31:55.620 --> 1:31:58.940
 And he did, and he embodied it, he lived it.

1:31:58.940 --> 1:32:02.540
 Man, do it many times in Europe where I said,

1:32:02.540 --> 1:32:05.220
 dude, just tape it up, go off to the side,

1:32:05.220 --> 1:32:07.620
 just take the day off, like, take the rest of the day off,

1:32:07.620 --> 1:32:08.860
 you're beat up, you can't do it.

1:32:08.860 --> 1:32:10.380
 He said, no, no, I'm gonna tape it up, I'm gonna tape it up.

1:32:10.380 --> 1:32:12.440
 I said, no, you don't need to right now.

1:32:12.440 --> 1:32:14.420
 And he said, no, sensei, I'm doing it.

1:32:14.420 --> 1:32:17.020
 You know, the ambulance isn't taking me out,

1:32:17.020 --> 1:32:20.380
 it's just my wrist, it's just my ankle, it's just my wrist.

1:32:20.380 --> 1:32:23.260
 It's just my ankle, yeah, I love it.

1:32:23.260 --> 1:32:27.160
 Yeah, what about the, so the other really big thing

1:32:27.160 --> 1:32:30.500
 is you comment on a little bit is the weight cut.

1:32:30.500 --> 1:32:33.860
 So early in his career, he was 81 kg,

1:32:33.860 --> 1:32:37.220
 and that was presumably not so difficult.

1:32:37.220 --> 1:32:40.420
 But later in his career, he is 81 kg,

1:32:40.420 --> 1:32:42.980
 and it's becoming more and more difficult.

1:32:42.980 --> 1:32:47.140
 So that's the other thing with him is,

1:32:47.140 --> 1:32:50.380
 so I've known a lot of really, really tough people

1:32:50.380 --> 1:32:53.100
 at the highest levels broken by the weight cut.

1:32:53.100 --> 1:32:55.480
 Like that can break the toughest minds.

1:32:55.480 --> 1:32:58.020
 And it doesn't seem to have broken him.

1:32:58.020 --> 1:33:03.020
 And he's delivered on it often, on like insane weight cuts.

1:33:03.020 --> 1:33:06.820
 So just as a coach, what do you think about his,

1:33:06.820 --> 1:33:10.740
 particularly his mind and the challenge of the weight cut?

1:33:10.740 --> 1:33:12.420
 It was part of his process.

1:33:12.420 --> 1:33:15.140
 It was part of his way of getting ready for battle.

1:33:15.140 --> 1:33:16.180
 Suffering?

1:33:16.180 --> 1:33:17.860
 Yeah, it really was.

1:33:17.860 --> 1:33:20.460
 And if I'm gonna suffer this much,

1:33:20.460 --> 1:33:22.460
 then I'm gonna make my opponents pay

1:33:22.460 --> 1:33:24.860
 for all the suffering that I went through to get here.

1:33:24.860 --> 1:33:26.020
 That was his mindset.

1:33:27.500 --> 1:33:29.100
 Later on in his career, you're right,

1:33:29.100 --> 1:33:31.260
 like a lot of times, Travis,

1:33:31.260 --> 1:33:33.420
 he would never step on a scale

1:33:33.420 --> 1:33:35.180
 until he got to the tournament.

1:33:35.180 --> 1:33:37.580
 And even when he get to the tournament,

1:33:37.580 --> 1:33:39.540
 like he'd weigh like 90 kilos.

1:33:39.540 --> 1:33:42.540
 He'd show up at the tournament nine kilos over.

1:33:42.540 --> 1:33:44.740
 I'm like, you have to, but I never,

1:33:44.740 --> 1:33:47.600
 it was just an expectation of making weight.

1:33:47.600 --> 1:33:49.340
 Not making weight was never an option

1:33:49.340 --> 1:33:50.680
 for any of our athletes.

1:33:50.680 --> 1:33:52.180
 And Travis knew it.

1:33:52.180 --> 1:33:56.380
 And he said, as a professional, my job is to make weight.

1:33:56.380 --> 1:33:57.620
 If I don't make weight,

1:33:57.620 --> 1:34:00.620
 he was never gonna allow that to happen.

1:34:00.620 --> 1:34:02.780
 And he was never gonna allow us to come to him and say,

1:34:02.780 --> 1:34:04.940
 hey, I told you.

1:34:04.940 --> 1:34:07.820
 Cause losing wasn't an option,

1:34:07.820 --> 1:34:08.900
 making weight wasn't,

1:34:08.900 --> 1:34:11.740
 not making weight was not an option for him ever either.

1:34:11.740 --> 1:34:14.340
 But a lot of times he wouldn't even,

1:34:14.340 --> 1:34:16.360
 he'd be nine kilos over on the plane

1:34:16.360 --> 1:34:17.980
 going over to the tournament

1:34:17.980 --> 1:34:20.220
 and have to make weight three days later.

1:34:20.220 --> 1:34:22.140
 And he didn't break 86 kilos

1:34:23.100 --> 1:34:24.740
 until the day before the tournament.

1:34:24.740 --> 1:34:26.780
 Like he had five kilos over the day before.

1:34:26.780 --> 1:34:27.780
 That was his way.

1:34:27.780 --> 1:34:30.500
 But he would do three workouts

1:34:30.500 --> 1:34:31.740
 to wake up in the morning and work out.

1:34:31.740 --> 1:34:32.580
 Then he'd eat.

1:34:32.580 --> 1:34:33.700
 Then he'd work out in the afternoon.

1:34:33.700 --> 1:34:34.540
 Then he'd eat again.

1:34:34.540 --> 1:34:36.580
 Then he'd work out again at night.

1:34:36.580 --> 1:34:37.820
 And then he'd reward himself.

1:34:37.820 --> 1:34:38.980
 Hey, I worked out three times today.

1:34:38.980 --> 1:34:41.540
 He'd go have a, you know, a Mountain Dew.

1:34:41.540 --> 1:34:42.380
 Yeah.

1:34:42.380 --> 1:34:43.740
 You know, or a chocolate bar.

1:34:43.740 --> 1:34:44.580
 You know?

1:34:44.580 --> 1:34:47.380
 And then his next morning, he's back up to 87

1:34:47.380 --> 1:34:49.980
 and he would never touch weight

1:34:49.980 --> 1:34:51.700
 until the morning of weigh ins.

1:34:51.700 --> 1:34:54.220
 That's a, when he,

1:34:54.220 --> 1:34:57.780
 he wasn't on weight for more than like five minutes.

1:34:57.780 --> 1:35:00.820
 His process would break a lot of people.

1:35:00.820 --> 1:35:03.540
 So the fact that he got the job done is...

1:35:03.540 --> 1:35:06.220
 Not just the job done, but every single time

1:35:06.220 --> 1:35:07.420
 he got the job done.

1:35:07.420 --> 1:35:10.160
 And I made those athletes fight.

1:35:10.160 --> 1:35:11.500
 We would fight in Paris.

1:35:11.500 --> 1:35:13.300
 We would do a camp for a week,

1:35:13.300 --> 1:35:15.420
 double session camp for a week.

1:35:15.420 --> 1:35:17.540
 He'd be seven kilos over,

1:35:17.540 --> 1:35:19.780
 have to fight the next weekend.

1:35:19.780 --> 1:35:21.700
 We're talking two or three days later.

1:35:21.700 --> 1:35:23.580
 You know, so not only did he make the weight,

1:35:23.580 --> 1:35:26.460
 but he did a grueling training camp twice a day.

1:35:26.460 --> 1:35:29.580
 And then cut weight and then fought again.

1:35:29.580 --> 1:35:31.220
 Then did another camp for a week

1:35:31.220 --> 1:35:32.820
 in double session training camp,

1:35:32.820 --> 1:35:34.460
 and then fought on a third weekend in a row.

1:35:34.460 --> 1:35:37.100
 And our athletes went through hell.

1:35:37.100 --> 1:35:38.700
 You know, all of our athletes went through hell

1:35:38.700 --> 1:35:42.340
 because on the tour around the world,

1:35:42.340 --> 1:35:43.860
 they fought in every event.

1:35:43.860 --> 1:35:45.020
 They did every camp.

1:35:45.020 --> 1:35:46.580
 They fought in every event.

1:35:46.580 --> 1:35:48.260
 Whereas most of the other teams,

1:35:48.260 --> 1:35:50.180
 like Japan comes in and fights in Paris,

1:35:50.180 --> 1:35:51.220
 then they go home.

1:35:51.220 --> 1:35:52.740
 You know, they maybe do a camp for three days,

1:35:52.740 --> 1:35:53.900
 then they go home.

1:35:53.900 --> 1:35:56.700
 They don't stay in Europe for four or five weeks straight

1:35:56.700 --> 1:35:57.980
 and fight in every tournament.

1:35:57.980 --> 1:35:59.460
 And when you get to Germany,

1:35:59.460 --> 1:36:01.340
 the Germans skip the French Open.

1:36:01.340 --> 1:36:02.540
 They skip the camp in France.

1:36:02.540 --> 1:36:04.220
 They're just getting ready for Germany.

1:36:04.220 --> 1:36:06.180
 Our athletes already had two competitions,

1:36:06.180 --> 1:36:09.100
 two training camps, three weight cuts now.

1:36:09.100 --> 1:36:12.260
 And then, so they're not 100% when they fight in Germany,

1:36:12.260 --> 1:36:14.740
 but that's all part of the experience they need,

1:36:14.740 --> 1:36:15.980
 the training that they need

1:36:15.980 --> 1:36:18.500
 that they don't get here in this country.

1:36:18.500 --> 1:36:20.220
 And all of those were just preparation

1:36:20.220 --> 1:36:23.500
 for our world championships or our Olympic games.

1:36:23.500 --> 1:36:26.540
 So by the time our athletes got to those tournaments,

1:36:26.540 --> 1:36:29.660
 they felt so strong, so rested, so like,

1:36:29.660 --> 1:36:32.980
 man, this guy that felt like a monster in Germany

1:36:32.980 --> 1:36:34.620
 feels like nothing today

1:36:34.620 --> 1:36:37.260
 because you're fully rested now, you know?

1:36:37.260 --> 1:36:38.340
 But part of the challenge

1:36:38.340 --> 1:36:42.060
 is because the American team is smaller and more,

1:36:42.060 --> 1:36:44.060
 I mean, just smaller,

1:36:44.060 --> 1:36:49.060
 is all the different places you go to do the weight cut,

1:36:49.060 --> 1:36:54.060
 to do the diet, to do the preparation or the recovery,

1:36:54.420 --> 1:36:58.180
 there's, like that process changes every time.

1:36:59.060 --> 1:37:01.580
 So you basically have to improvise a lot.

1:37:01.580 --> 1:37:03.820
 So you show up to a hotel

1:37:03.820 --> 1:37:05.700
 and how you do the weight cut, you don't know.

1:37:05.700 --> 1:37:07.340
 And this is the different weather conditions.

1:37:07.340 --> 1:37:11.140
 It's not, it's like, what is it?

1:37:11.140 --> 1:37:12.540
 Rocky versus Drago, right?

1:37:12.540 --> 1:37:13.380
 That's it.

1:37:13.380 --> 1:37:15.180
 So you don't have, you have to just improvise.

1:37:15.180 --> 1:37:16.860
 And that's also a fascinating part

1:37:16.860 --> 1:37:18.100
 of the American judo story,

1:37:18.100 --> 1:37:19.900
 which is like, you have to improvise more.

1:37:19.900 --> 1:37:22.820
 Well, it was funny because when I, it was 1990,

1:37:22.820 --> 1:37:25.020
 and it was at the Goodwill Games, right?

1:37:25.020 --> 1:37:28.420
 And we were, it was a US Olympic committee type event.

1:37:28.420 --> 1:37:31.580
 And so we're on the bus with the swim team.

1:37:31.580 --> 1:37:34.500
 And it was me and Jason Morris on the American team,

1:37:34.500 --> 1:37:36.420
 and we're going to the judo competition,

1:37:36.420 --> 1:37:38.180
 but we're on the bus with the swim team.

1:37:38.180 --> 1:37:40.780
 I'm sorry, we're going to the venue where we're staying.

1:37:40.780 --> 1:37:42.660
 You know, I remember being like by ourselves

1:37:42.660 --> 1:37:45.220
 with no staff, no manager, no coach,

1:37:45.220 --> 1:37:48.300
 we're just by ourselves going to fight in Russia, right?

1:37:48.300 --> 1:37:52.820
 And the swim team's on there with their full sweats

1:37:52.820 --> 1:37:54.900
 and their staff and like their managers.

1:37:54.900 --> 1:37:57.500
 And I heard the lady, the girl go,

1:37:57.500 --> 1:37:58.700
 I'm sorry, this was 1994,

1:37:58.700 --> 1:38:00.140
 because it was in St. Petersburg, Russia.

1:38:00.140 --> 1:38:02.660
 So I heard the little girl on the team,

1:38:02.660 --> 1:38:03.700
 she goes up to the coach, she goes,

1:38:03.700 --> 1:38:06.860
 coach, do you think you can send the massage therapist

1:38:06.860 --> 1:38:08.020
 to my room at 10 a.m.?

1:38:08.020 --> 1:38:10.300
 You know, I'm feeling kind of jet lag.

1:38:10.300 --> 1:38:13.380
 I looked at, me and Jason looked at each other like,

1:38:13.380 --> 1:38:17.660
 oh, she's scheduling a massage?

1:38:17.660 --> 1:38:18.700
 We don't even have a staff.

1:38:18.700 --> 1:38:20.380
 Like what the hell is going on here?

1:38:20.380 --> 1:38:23.460
 You know, what a difference in sporting,

1:38:23.460 --> 1:38:26.340
 you know, different sports within the same country,

1:38:26.340 --> 1:38:27.180
 you know, and.

1:38:27.180 --> 1:38:29.940
 But that, I mean, not to romanticize things,

1:38:29.940 --> 1:38:32.620
 but that you do represent the spirit of the Olympics

1:38:32.620 --> 1:38:37.340
 when you're kind of the improvisational nature of it.

1:38:37.340 --> 1:38:41.540
 Cause it is just you, you and sometimes you and the coach

1:38:41.540 --> 1:38:46.540
 and just pure guts and you against the world with no money.

1:38:47.460 --> 1:38:48.540
 The warrior spirit.

1:38:48.540 --> 1:38:49.660
 The warrior spirit.

1:38:51.420 --> 1:38:53.100
 How did it feel like when he,

1:38:53.100 --> 1:38:56.460
 after being in two Olympics,

1:38:56.460 --> 1:38:59.060
 beating some of the best people in the world,

1:38:59.060 --> 1:39:01.300
 facing some of the best people in the world

1:39:01.300 --> 1:39:04.300
 and just barely losing,

1:39:04.300 --> 1:39:06.100
 what did it feel like to you as a coach

1:39:06.100 --> 1:39:08.620
 to see Travis Stevens win the silver medal?

1:39:10.020 --> 1:39:11.420
 Electric.

1:39:11.420 --> 1:39:16.420
 I like, first of all, in 2012 in London,

1:39:16.860 --> 1:39:20.100
 it was like, it felt like somebody died.

1:39:20.100 --> 1:39:21.540
 I'm not going to be, I'm not going to lie to you.

1:39:21.540 --> 1:39:22.380
 Like.

1:39:22.380 --> 1:39:23.420
 The Ole Bischoff match?

1:39:23.420 --> 1:39:27.940
 Not, no, just seeing Travis not finish on the podium period.

1:39:27.940 --> 1:39:30.300
 You know, in the Ole Bischoff match,

1:39:30.300 --> 1:39:33.620
 I thought he won regardless of who won and who lost.

1:39:33.620 --> 1:39:35.980
 He just left everything he had on that mat, right?

1:39:35.980 --> 1:39:38.700
 10 minutes of probably it was a 20 something minute match,

1:39:38.700 --> 1:39:41.780
 but 10 minutes of fighting actually, right?

1:39:41.780 --> 1:39:43.060
 He left everything he had.

1:39:43.060 --> 1:39:44.460
 He wanted to be in the Olympic finals.

1:39:44.460 --> 1:39:46.140
 He wanted to be Olympic champion.

1:39:46.140 --> 1:39:47.860
 And when he didn't get that opportunity,

1:39:47.860 --> 1:39:49.260
 he lost everything.

1:39:49.260 --> 1:39:50.300
 He drained himself.

1:39:50.300 --> 1:39:52.700
 He cried for 45 minutes straight.

1:39:52.700 --> 1:39:53.820
 I couldn't regroup him.

1:39:53.820 --> 1:39:54.780
 I couldn't get him up.

1:39:54.780 --> 1:39:56.900
 I said, Travis, you've got to stop your crying.

1:39:56.900 --> 1:39:58.460
 You've got to get off the floor.

1:39:58.460 --> 1:40:00.220
 We've got a bronze medal fight.

1:40:00.220 --> 1:40:03.780
 Like if you don't recover, you're not going to perform well.

1:40:03.780 --> 1:40:04.940
 And he just didn't care.

1:40:04.940 --> 1:40:06.980
 Like it was gold or nothing.

1:40:06.980 --> 1:40:09.700
 And so when he walked out against the Canadian boy,

1:40:09.700 --> 1:40:10.620
 he had beaten the Canadian.

1:40:10.620 --> 1:40:11.980
 I think at that time,

1:40:11.980 --> 1:40:14.020
 he had beaten that Canadian every single time,

1:40:14.020 --> 1:40:16.060
 except for that bronze medal match.

1:40:16.060 --> 1:40:18.460
 But he just didn't have the fight in him anymore.

1:40:18.460 --> 1:40:19.700
 You know, he'd left it all in the match,

1:40:19.700 --> 1:40:20.980
 in the Bischoff match.

1:40:20.980 --> 1:40:23.180
 So to see him come back with zero, right?

1:40:23.180 --> 1:40:26.780
 We just had a team where his best friend, Marty Malloy,

1:40:26.780 --> 1:40:29.180
 won a bronze medal, right?

1:40:29.180 --> 1:40:31.620
 Then the day after Travis fights,

1:40:31.620 --> 1:40:34.180
 Kayla Harrison goes and wins her first gold medal, right?

1:40:34.180 --> 1:40:35.020
 Our first ever gold.

1:40:35.020 --> 1:40:36.380
 So we have a gold and a bronze.

1:40:36.380 --> 1:40:38.460
 His training partner wins a gold.

1:40:38.460 --> 1:40:41.220
 His best friend from growing up wins a bronze.

1:40:41.220 --> 1:40:42.860
 He has nothing, right?

1:40:42.860 --> 1:40:46.980
 To see him for four years go through hell,

1:40:46.980 --> 1:40:49.580
 like literally like all of his injuries,

1:40:49.580 --> 1:40:50.980
 every training camp,

1:40:50.980 --> 1:40:52.500
 and then forget the humiliation,

1:40:52.500 --> 1:40:56.540
 because every time any reporter ever came to my dojo,

1:40:56.540 --> 1:40:57.620
 they want to talk to Kayla.

1:40:57.620 --> 1:40:59.100
 She's the Olympic champion.

1:40:59.100 --> 1:41:00.940
 Who's this Travis guy?

1:41:00.940 --> 1:41:01.980
 Who is this guy?

1:41:01.980 --> 1:41:04.180
 So he didn't medal.

1:41:04.180 --> 1:41:05.300
 He's not that important.

1:41:05.300 --> 1:41:08.780
 And up until you get to right before the Olympics,

1:41:08.780 --> 1:41:11.660
 now they talk about he's an Olympian again.

1:41:11.660 --> 1:41:12.740
 But up until that point,

1:41:12.740 --> 1:41:16.460
 and then every little kid sees Kayla's medal.

1:41:16.460 --> 1:41:18.740
 Oh, Travis, yeah, you went to the Olympics.

1:41:18.740 --> 1:41:19.580
 Where's your medal?

1:41:19.580 --> 1:41:20.500
 How did you do?

1:41:20.500 --> 1:41:22.860
 You know, I took fifth, I didn't place.

1:41:22.860 --> 1:41:25.020
 You know, it's the lowest of low,

1:41:25.020 --> 1:41:27.380
 every day having that constant reminder.

1:41:27.380 --> 1:41:31.700
 So four years later, when that guy,

1:41:31.700 --> 1:41:35.540
 I mean, mentally, he was ready.

1:41:35.540 --> 1:41:37.900
 Physically, he was ready.

1:41:37.900 --> 1:41:41.780
 That was the best and strongest Travis Stevens

1:41:41.780 --> 1:41:43.980
 that I've ever seen and I've ever felt.

1:41:43.980 --> 1:41:45.380
 Like, cause I had to get on the mat

1:41:45.380 --> 1:41:47.060
 and do some drills and stuff like that,

1:41:47.060 --> 1:41:48.660
 and like try to defend armbars,

1:41:48.660 --> 1:41:51.300
 and cause we didn't have a lot of bodies in Rio.

1:41:51.300 --> 1:41:53.100
 And I was like, my God, he's,

1:41:53.100 --> 1:41:54.260
 I said after one of the prizes,

1:41:54.260 --> 1:41:56.580
 those are the strongest I've ever felt that guy, right?

1:41:56.580 --> 1:41:59.100
 Before the competition, so physically he was ready.

1:41:59.100 --> 1:42:00.940
 Mentally, the morning of competition,

1:42:00.940 --> 1:42:03.580
 I said to Travis, I looked him in the eye,

1:42:03.580 --> 1:42:06.340
 and I said, you know, we're ready to go over to the venue.

1:42:06.340 --> 1:42:07.940
 I said, are you ready today?

1:42:07.940 --> 1:42:10.340
 And he just looked at me like he goes,

1:42:10.340 --> 1:42:12.420
 I am gonna shock the world today.

1:42:12.420 --> 1:42:14.060
 That's what he told me, I'm gonna shock the world today.

1:42:14.060 --> 1:42:16.900
 And I said, all right, great, let's go, right?

1:42:16.900 --> 1:42:18.580
 So we go to the venue,

1:42:18.580 --> 1:42:23.140
 and every other athlete was just like nervously,

1:42:23.140 --> 1:42:25.300
 like doing repetitions of Uchi Komis.

1:42:25.300 --> 1:42:27.060
 You could see like sweat coming out.

1:42:27.060 --> 1:42:29.780
 You could see like all this nervous energy

1:42:29.780 --> 1:42:31.580
 going through their body.

1:42:31.580 --> 1:42:32.820
 And here comes Travis Stevens.

1:42:32.820 --> 1:42:35.460
 He's got these big goofy headphones on.

1:42:35.460 --> 1:42:38.220
 He's got a tank top that says USA on it.

1:42:38.220 --> 1:42:41.260
 He's got the swim trunks that say USA,

1:42:41.260 --> 1:42:44.300
 like that have shiny letters that glow in the dark.

1:42:44.300 --> 1:42:47.580
 And he's like, and this is in the middle of the judo hall

1:42:47.580 --> 1:42:48.780
 where all these athletes are warming up

1:42:48.780 --> 1:42:50.060
 for their first match.

1:42:50.060 --> 1:42:53.260
 He's like dancing around, like doing this loose warmup,

1:42:53.260 --> 1:42:56.780
 like almost like a little kid at an amusement park

1:42:56.780 --> 1:42:59.540
 whose dad said, yeah, go play, you know?

1:42:59.540 --> 1:43:01.900
 And it was like, he had waited four years for that moment,

1:43:01.900 --> 1:43:05.700
 and he was so relaxed, so focused, so relaxed,

1:43:05.700 --> 1:43:07.380
 and couldn't wait.

1:43:07.380 --> 1:43:08.700
 It was like a caged tiger.

1:43:08.700 --> 1:43:10.700
 Like if you like coming out of the chute

1:43:10.700 --> 1:43:14.820
 to go step on to the mat was like this tiger

1:43:14.820 --> 1:43:16.300
 that you were just letting out of the cage,

1:43:16.300 --> 1:43:18.660
 and he just go, like now's your time to go fight.

1:43:18.660 --> 1:43:20.420
 And that's what he did that whole day.

1:43:20.420 --> 1:43:25.140
 And like when he beat Chirikishvili in the semis

1:43:25.140 --> 1:43:27.860
 and choked him out and won that fight,

1:43:27.860 --> 1:43:30.780
 like there's nobody with the exception

1:43:30.780 --> 1:43:33.340
 of maybe the guys in the American team,

1:43:33.340 --> 1:43:35.660
 there was nobody in that stadium

1:43:35.660 --> 1:43:38.420
 that expected Travis to beat him, nobody.

1:43:38.420 --> 1:43:41.580
 Like, you know, he had smashed Travis,

1:43:41.580 --> 1:43:43.460
 I don't know how many times before that free poem,

1:43:43.460 --> 1:43:44.620
 like in the first minute even.

1:43:44.620 --> 1:43:46.020
 It wasn't even a fight, right?

1:43:46.020 --> 1:43:49.140
 And it was great game plan.

1:43:49.140 --> 1:43:51.740
 He's the world number one at the time too.

1:43:52.820 --> 1:43:56.860
 World number one at the time, world champion,

1:43:56.860 --> 1:43:59.940
 carried the flag for the Georgian Federation

1:43:59.940 --> 1:44:01.460
 walking into the games,

1:44:02.740 --> 1:44:06.340
 most dominant 81 kilo player in that weight class

1:44:06.340 --> 1:44:08.220
 for quite some time.

1:44:08.220 --> 1:44:13.220
 And man, we just had his number and Travis was ready to go.

1:44:13.220 --> 1:44:14.060
 It was so cool.

1:44:14.060 --> 1:44:15.740
 It was so awesome.

1:44:15.740 --> 1:44:17.340
 I mean, we had already won,

1:44:17.340 --> 1:44:20.220
 Kayla had already won her second gold, right?

1:44:20.220 --> 1:44:24.340
 The way the event went and Travis winning that

1:44:24.340 --> 1:44:26.340
 was like icing on the cake for our team.

1:44:26.340 --> 1:44:29.220
 That was the best performance we've ever had in history.

1:44:29.220 --> 1:44:30.060
 It's awesome.

1:44:30.060 --> 1:44:31.620
 So you mentioned Kayla.

1:44:31.620 --> 1:44:36.060
 She is one of, if not the greatest American Jidoka ever.

1:44:36.940 --> 1:44:39.540
 Two time gold medalist.

1:44:39.540 --> 1:44:41.980
 2010 world champion.

1:44:41.980 --> 1:44:42.820
 2010.

1:44:42.820 --> 1:44:43.860
 First senior worlds.

1:44:43.860 --> 1:44:45.580
 Senior worlds.

1:44:45.580 --> 1:44:49.220
 What makes Kayla special?

1:44:49.220 --> 1:44:51.420
 What makes her so great?

1:44:51.420 --> 1:44:53.300
 What made this champion?

1:44:53.300 --> 1:44:57.420
 It's a combination of a lot of things.

1:44:57.420 --> 1:45:01.180
 One was obviously Kayla's mental toughness, right?

1:45:01.180 --> 1:45:03.860
 To overcome what she overcame.

1:45:03.860 --> 1:45:05.740
 You know, this is a girl who,

1:45:06.940 --> 1:45:10.300
 you know, let's not say forget about the sexual abuse,

1:45:10.300 --> 1:45:13.260
 but the fact that she had to go through that in life

1:45:13.260 --> 1:45:15.860
 and learned how to compartmentalize that

1:45:15.860 --> 1:45:18.420
 and keep that off as a separate part of her brain,

1:45:18.420 --> 1:45:21.060
 you know, and forget about it and move on.

1:45:21.060 --> 1:45:23.700
 That took an incredible team to help her do that,

1:45:23.700 --> 1:45:28.180
 and my dad was a huge part of her accomplishing that.

1:45:28.180 --> 1:45:30.860
 So for people who don't know, we should comment

1:45:30.860 --> 1:45:33.980
 and say that Kayla had to go through trauma

1:45:33.980 --> 1:45:37.420
 in her earlier life through sexual abuse

1:45:37.420 --> 1:45:39.700
 and had to overcome that through the whole process

1:45:39.700 --> 1:45:43.220
 of becoming a champion as well.

1:45:43.220 --> 1:45:45.940
 Because she had zero self esteem, zero self worth.

1:45:45.940 --> 1:45:47.420
 She was at the lowest of lows

1:45:47.420 --> 1:45:51.580
 and didn't even want to be on this earth, right?

1:45:51.580 --> 1:45:55.100
 So she was traumatized obviously

1:45:56.180 --> 1:45:57.460
 and getting her the right help

1:45:57.460 --> 1:45:59.060
 and surrounding her with the right people

1:45:59.060 --> 1:46:01.460
 who could help her get through that

1:46:01.460 --> 1:46:05.020
 and be by her side as she's getting through that

1:46:05.020 --> 1:46:06.780
 and letting her know and reaffirming

1:46:06.780 --> 1:46:08.380
 that she's doing the right thing

1:46:08.380 --> 1:46:09.780
 and she made the right decision

1:46:09.780 --> 1:46:11.780
 and she should have zero guilt.

1:46:11.780 --> 1:46:14.060
 And you know, this doesn't define her.

1:46:14.060 --> 1:46:15.820
 It happened to her, but it doesn't define her.

1:46:15.820 --> 1:46:18.580
 What defines her is what she does from now on.

1:46:18.580 --> 1:46:21.580
 And then rebuilding that person to become who she became.

1:46:21.580 --> 1:46:25.340
 I think the mental toughness is a big part of it, her mind.

1:46:26.700 --> 1:46:31.700
 But then as an athlete, she's a lot like Travis.

1:46:32.540 --> 1:46:34.060
 She's a warrior.

1:46:34.060 --> 1:46:35.020
 She's a fighter.

1:46:35.020 --> 1:46:37.180
 My dad always jokes with her.

1:46:37.180 --> 1:46:39.260
 He says, you're a workhorse.

1:46:39.260 --> 1:46:40.180
 You're not a thoroughbred.

1:46:40.180 --> 1:46:42.460
 We're not gonna treat you like a thoroughbred, right?

1:46:42.460 --> 1:46:45.220
 You're a workhorse, so you're gonna work.

1:46:45.220 --> 1:46:46.860
 And the way you're gonna get bigger and stronger

1:46:46.860 --> 1:46:48.580
 is you're gonna work harder and you're gonna keep, you know.

1:46:48.580 --> 1:46:50.820
 And she came to us when she was only 15.

1:46:50.820 --> 1:46:53.020
 So at that time we got her

1:46:53.020 --> 1:46:55.260
 with a really good strength and conditioning coach.

1:46:55.260 --> 1:46:57.700
 We did all the core Olympic style lifting.

1:46:57.700 --> 1:47:00.340
 Like as her body was developing,

1:47:00.340 --> 1:47:02.340
 she was getting stronger every single day.

1:47:02.340 --> 1:47:04.300
 And then, you know, she had the luxury

1:47:04.300 --> 1:47:06.260
 of being on the mat with,

1:47:06.260 --> 1:47:08.380
 at the time I was still young enough to train

1:47:08.380 --> 1:47:10.460
 and be on the mat and I was around her weight class

1:47:10.460 --> 1:47:12.100
 and Travis was able to train with her

1:47:12.100 --> 1:47:15.540
 and we had all the top US athletes at the time

1:47:15.540 --> 1:47:16.700
 training here at my school.

1:47:16.700 --> 1:47:19.140
 So she got the benefit of all the best guys

1:47:19.140 --> 1:47:21.060
 to train within the country, you know.

1:47:21.060 --> 1:47:24.260
 And her doing all of those rounds,

1:47:24.260 --> 1:47:26.340
 you know, night in, week, night,

1:47:26.340 --> 1:47:28.700
 every night, every week, every year,

1:47:28.700 --> 1:47:30.300
 compiled with the best, you know,

1:47:30.300 --> 1:47:32.700
 highest level she could as a girl.

1:47:32.700 --> 1:47:34.420
 She got the strength, she got the technique,

1:47:34.420 --> 1:47:36.660
 she got the, and then she had the coaching on top of it

1:47:36.660 --> 1:47:38.340
 with my dad being on her as, you know,

1:47:38.340 --> 1:47:42.060
 working her out and, you know, having the wherewithal

1:47:42.060 --> 1:47:44.180
 to develop a strategy and a plan for her.

1:47:44.180 --> 1:47:46.260
 Because when she first came here,

1:47:46.260 --> 1:47:50.260
 she competed at 63 kilos, which is 138 pounds.

1:47:51.380 --> 1:47:55.060
 At the time, Rhonda Rousey was also training here

1:47:55.060 --> 1:47:56.940
 and she was 70 kilos.

1:47:56.940 --> 1:48:00.260
 So if Kayla was struggling making 63,

1:48:00.260 --> 1:48:01.820
 so the only way to, obviously,

1:48:01.820 --> 1:48:04.220
 the only way to still compete is to move up.

1:48:04.220 --> 1:48:05.780
 But my dad said, well, if you move up,

1:48:05.780 --> 1:48:06.940
 then you're in Rhonda's weight.

1:48:06.940 --> 1:48:09.580
 So let's skip that weight and you're gonna go to 78 kilos.

1:48:09.580 --> 1:48:12.500
 And he told her, listen, you're gonna go up two weight classes.

1:48:12.500 --> 1:48:15.380
 She looked at him and was like, that's 172 pounds.

1:48:15.380 --> 1:48:17.220
 And he goes, well, I don't care.

1:48:17.220 --> 1:48:19.460
 Like, you're already struggling making 138,

1:48:19.460 --> 1:48:20.980
 you weigh 150, what's the difference?

1:48:20.980 --> 1:48:23.220
 We put 20 pounds on, go to 170.

1:48:23.220 --> 1:48:24.980
 So that's why she jumped two weights,

1:48:24.980 --> 1:48:27.500
 because she passed Rhonda, she went to the weight above

1:48:27.500 --> 1:48:29.100
 so she could make the national team

1:48:29.100 --> 1:48:30.740
 and she had a chance to go to the Olympics

1:48:30.740 --> 1:48:33.020
 and all that, because we envisioned Rhonda

1:48:33.020 --> 1:48:34.980
 staying around till 2012.

1:48:34.980 --> 1:48:37.300
 And that's also like a longterm vision

1:48:37.300 --> 1:48:40.340
 because you kind of grow into that body then over time.

1:48:40.340 --> 1:48:41.180
 Correct.

1:48:41.180 --> 1:48:42.500
 So you can dominate, you can learn

1:48:42.500 --> 1:48:43.900
 what it's like in that weight class.

1:48:43.900 --> 1:48:46.020
 You can learn to dominate that weight class,

1:48:46.020 --> 1:48:47.700
 excel and then dominate.

1:48:47.700 --> 1:48:49.980
 People that cut weight too hard, too long,

1:48:49.980 --> 1:48:51.260
 they forget about technique

1:48:51.260 --> 1:48:52.940
 because they're only worried about losing weight.

1:48:52.940 --> 1:48:54.500
 They're always tired in training.

1:48:54.500 --> 1:48:57.340
 They don't give 100% effort, they're not getting better.

1:48:57.340 --> 1:49:00.500
 She now is just focused on getting better at judo,

1:49:00.500 --> 1:49:02.660
 getting bigger, getting stronger, getting more powerful.

1:49:02.660 --> 1:49:05.420
 So I think giving her that purpose and that,

1:49:05.420 --> 1:49:06.540
 that was a great call.

1:49:07.700 --> 1:49:11.900
 What are some memorable or maybe the most memorable moment,

1:49:11.900 --> 1:49:14.740
 Kayla Harrison moment to you as her coach?

1:49:16.860 --> 1:49:19.340
 Not the most perhaps, let's say,

1:49:19.340 --> 1:49:21.140
 what are some memorable moments?

1:49:22.220 --> 1:49:23.620
 Everybody hears the good ones, right?

1:49:23.620 --> 1:49:26.220
 So everybody knows she won the world championships

1:49:26.220 --> 1:49:28.740
 in Tokyo in 2010.

1:49:28.740 --> 1:49:31.900
 She was our two time Olympic champion in 2012, 2016.

1:49:31.900 --> 1:49:34.140
 I'll never forget those moments, right?

1:49:34.140 --> 1:49:35.420
 Cause they're historic.

1:49:36.660 --> 1:49:40.460
 One of the biggest moments that I liked sharing this story

1:49:40.460 --> 1:49:45.460
 with everybody is that in 2010 in January,

1:49:45.860 --> 1:49:48.020
 Kayla was still a developing athlete

1:49:48.020 --> 1:49:50.220
 and we had a local tournament in New York.

1:49:50.220 --> 1:49:53.580
 It was in Brooklyn, New York, it was called the Starrett Cup.

1:49:53.580 --> 1:49:55.180
 And I knew that at that tournament

1:49:55.180 --> 1:49:57.180
 that two of the Canadian girls,

1:49:57.180 --> 1:49:59.740
 they were like ranked 15th or 20th in the world.

1:49:59.740 --> 1:50:02.540
 They weren't superstars, but they were tough players.

1:50:02.540 --> 1:50:04.780
 Both of them, I knew were gonna be at that tournament.

1:50:04.780 --> 1:50:07.100
 So I said, Kayla, we're gonna go to this tournament,

1:50:07.100 --> 1:50:08.620
 you're gonna compete against the Canadian girls,

1:50:08.620 --> 1:50:10.140
 get some good experience,

1:50:10.140 --> 1:50:11.300
 figure out what you need to work on

1:50:11.300 --> 1:50:13.820
 and then we'll go home and work on some stuff.

1:50:13.820 --> 1:50:14.940
 Well, she went to the tournament,

1:50:14.940 --> 1:50:16.540
 there was only three girls in the weight,

1:50:16.540 --> 1:50:18.420
 her and the two Canadians.

1:50:18.420 --> 1:50:22.740
 At that tournament, she lost both fights, right?

1:50:22.740 --> 1:50:26.340
 So this is January, 2010, she lost both matches.

1:50:26.340 --> 1:50:27.260
 She was competitive,

1:50:27.260 --> 1:50:29.420
 but certainly things she needed to work on,

1:50:29.420 --> 1:50:32.540
 it was good development thing for her and for us.

1:50:32.540 --> 1:50:34.940
 It also opened her mind to say, oh man,

1:50:34.940 --> 1:50:39.540
 cause she was already a junior world champion at the time.

1:50:39.540 --> 1:50:40.940
 But so now there's another level,

1:50:40.940 --> 1:50:42.180
 this is a senior level, right?

1:50:42.180 --> 1:50:43.420
 You gotta go up another level.

1:50:43.420 --> 1:50:45.500
 Here's two girls that aren't even medalists

1:50:45.500 --> 1:50:46.340
 that are beating you.

1:50:46.340 --> 1:50:48.140
 So now there's more work to be done.

1:50:48.140 --> 1:50:49.580
 And so I like telling that story

1:50:49.580 --> 1:50:53.500
 because everybody sees the champions in the greatest moments,

1:50:53.500 --> 1:50:55.620
 they don't see them when they have bad days.

1:50:55.620 --> 1:50:58.740
 And could you imagine being, oh and two,

1:50:58.740 --> 1:51:01.620
 you feel like a failure, right?

1:51:01.620 --> 1:51:06.620
 But 10 months later, it was Tokyo 2010,

1:51:06.780 --> 1:51:09.660
 she went from oh and two at Starret, New York

1:51:10.940 --> 1:51:15.940
 to world champion 2010 in the motherland in Japan.

1:51:16.860 --> 1:51:19.420
 I mean, that's an amazing turnaround.

1:51:19.420 --> 1:51:22.540
 And that's only possible if you put the losses

1:51:22.540 --> 1:51:24.340
 in their proper context,

1:51:24.340 --> 1:51:26.580
 you don't let it destroy you mentally

1:51:26.580 --> 1:51:28.100
 and just keep moving forward.

1:51:28.100 --> 1:51:29.460
 Correct.

1:51:29.460 --> 1:51:31.100
 This is so funny.

1:51:31.100 --> 1:51:34.380
 So you were there 2010 at the Starret Cup?

1:51:34.380 --> 1:51:35.980
 Was Travis there?

1:51:35.980 --> 1:51:36.820
 Yeah.

1:51:36.820 --> 1:51:38.900
 I made all those, we fought at every,

1:51:38.900 --> 1:51:41.540
 like the mentality of our team was

1:51:41.540 --> 1:51:43.820
 no tournament is beneath us.

1:51:43.820 --> 1:51:47.900
 If our goal is to go to the Olympics in the world and win,

1:51:47.900 --> 1:51:49.580
 there's no tournament that's beneath us.

1:51:49.580 --> 1:51:51.820
 We're gonna get experience, we're gonna fight,

1:51:51.820 --> 1:51:54.020
 we're gonna learn, we're gonna compete,

1:51:54.020 --> 1:51:56.380
 we're gonna get better, you know?

1:51:56.380 --> 1:51:59.980
 I actually, just as a funny little side,

1:51:59.980 --> 1:52:01.860
 I was there, I competed.

1:52:01.860 --> 1:52:02.700
 Really?

1:52:02.700 --> 1:52:04.140
 This is one of the earlier tournaments,

1:52:04.140 --> 1:52:05.460
 like the beginner division.

1:52:05.460 --> 1:52:07.700
 Oh no, I actually did black belt division too.

1:52:07.700 --> 1:52:11.780
 That was one of the, actually yeah, I remember that.

1:52:11.780 --> 1:52:15.140
 That's when it was so early that I thought,

1:52:16.540 --> 1:52:18.980
 like I was also really strong at that time,

1:52:18.980 --> 1:52:21.100
 just like physically like power lifting stuff.

1:52:21.100 --> 1:52:24.260
 So I thought like it'll be good experience

1:52:24.260 --> 1:52:26.620
 to also do black belt division.

1:52:26.620 --> 1:52:28.620
 And remember, it must have been actually

1:52:28.620 --> 1:52:30.380
 Travis's division, which is funny.

1:52:32.540 --> 1:52:33.700
 Is Legere Brothers?

1:52:33.700 --> 1:52:35.500
 Yeah, Harry and Gary.

1:52:35.500 --> 1:52:37.580
 They are super, they're super good

1:52:37.580 --> 1:52:38.700
 and they're super dominant,

1:52:38.700 --> 1:52:42.460
 but I think Travis faced one of them and beat them.

1:52:43.740 --> 1:52:45.380
 I don't know, I just remembered,

1:52:46.420 --> 1:52:48.620
 it's funny how there's just like these little roads

1:52:48.620 --> 1:52:51.340
 that later reconnect.

1:52:51.340 --> 1:52:54.420
 But yeah, there's some incredible people there.

1:52:54.420 --> 1:52:57.460
 And I saw obviously the positive things

1:52:57.460 --> 1:52:59.860
 and it's interesting that Kayla's story

1:52:59.860 --> 1:53:01.380
 was also intersecting there

1:53:01.380 --> 1:53:03.620
 and that was one of the lower points for her.

1:53:04.540 --> 1:53:06.940
 Another story I like to share is that

1:53:08.100 --> 1:53:09.940
 you have to know your athletes, right?

1:53:09.940 --> 1:53:12.180
 And you have to really get to know their,

1:53:13.380 --> 1:53:15.420
 what they're thinking psychologically, mentally,

1:53:15.420 --> 1:53:16.540
 what's going through their head.

1:53:16.540 --> 1:53:20.020
 Another story was in Tokyo.

1:53:20.020 --> 1:53:25.020
 It was 2015, the Tokyo Grand Slam.

1:53:25.460 --> 1:53:28.140
 So we had had Kayla face off

1:53:28.140 --> 1:53:30.900
 against almost all the top girls in her division.

1:53:30.900 --> 1:53:34.100
 She had beaten everybody going into the 2016 Olympics.

1:53:34.100 --> 1:53:37.620
 But at the 2015 Tokyo Grand Slam,

1:53:39.020 --> 1:53:40.660
 there was a girl from Japan

1:53:40.660 --> 1:53:42.220
 that she hadn't fought in a long time

1:53:42.220 --> 1:53:44.380
 and she lost to the girl last time she fought her.

1:53:44.380 --> 1:53:46.460
 So it was something we wanted her

1:53:46.460 --> 1:53:48.540
 to beat this girl going into the Olympics

1:53:48.540 --> 1:53:50.580
 so that she knew she could beat everybody.

1:53:52.300 --> 1:53:54.660
 And it was a first round match

1:53:54.660 --> 1:53:57.940
 and it was gonna be tough for Kayla, right?

1:53:57.940 --> 1:53:59.180
 It was gonna be a really hard fight.

1:53:59.180 --> 1:54:02.540
 And she had won a bunch of tournaments in a row

1:54:02.540 --> 1:54:03.380
 leading up to that.

1:54:03.380 --> 1:54:06.620
 So her confidence was really high, but at the same time,

1:54:06.620 --> 1:54:08.740
 she didn't think she needed this fight.

1:54:10.500 --> 1:54:13.860
 And she showed up to the tournament and she said,

1:54:13.860 --> 1:54:15.500
 I don't think I can fight today.

1:54:15.500 --> 1:54:17.260
 I've got a stinger in my neck.

1:54:17.260 --> 1:54:19.660
 I've got a stinger coming down my neck and I'm kind of sore.

1:54:19.660 --> 1:54:21.740
 And she didn't tell us.

1:54:21.740 --> 1:54:23.380
 She went and told the trainer.

1:54:23.380 --> 1:54:25.740
 She walked around, she's holding her neck.

1:54:25.740 --> 1:54:27.780
 And me and my dad were like, what's up with her?

1:54:27.780 --> 1:54:28.620
 I don't know.

1:54:28.620 --> 1:54:32.540
 And then, so maybe she doesn't wanna fight today.

1:54:32.540 --> 1:54:33.380
 I don't know, right?

1:54:33.380 --> 1:54:35.940
 So all of a sudden the trainer comes up to us

1:54:35.940 --> 1:54:37.020
 and she didn't come to us.

1:54:37.020 --> 1:54:37.940
 The trainer came to us and says,

1:54:37.940 --> 1:54:39.780
 you know, I really don't think it's a good idea

1:54:39.780 --> 1:54:41.580
 that Kayla fight today.

1:54:41.580 --> 1:54:43.700
 And we looked at him and we're like,

1:54:43.700 --> 1:54:45.740
 well, your opinion doesn't really matter, does it?

1:54:45.740 --> 1:54:46.580
 Right?

1:54:46.580 --> 1:54:47.420
 Yeah.

1:54:47.420 --> 1:54:48.260
 What's up with her?

1:54:48.260 --> 1:54:49.100
 Yeah.

1:54:49.100 --> 1:54:49.940
 Well, she has this thing in her neck.

1:54:49.940 --> 1:54:52.380
 It's like a pinched nerve and there's this and that.

1:54:53.380 --> 1:54:56.980
 We talked, I said, is there a risk of her getting injured?

1:54:56.980 --> 1:54:58.660
 Like, is this pain or is this risk

1:54:58.660 --> 1:55:00.620
 that she's gonna get injured and she's gonna set her back

1:55:00.620 --> 1:55:02.740
 like long time in her career?

1:55:02.740 --> 1:55:04.420
 Says, no, she's not gonna get injured.

1:55:04.420 --> 1:55:05.260
 It's just a pinched nerve.

1:55:05.260 --> 1:55:06.500
 It's a little pain she's gonna have to deal with.

1:55:06.500 --> 1:55:08.660
 I go, okay, well, can you fix the pain?

1:55:09.700 --> 1:55:11.500
 Says, yeah, I can do this and that

1:55:11.500 --> 1:55:13.700
 and I can give her a shot and the pain will go away.

1:55:13.700 --> 1:55:15.580
 I said, okay, then do that.

1:55:15.580 --> 1:55:17.220
 And so Kayla comes up, she goes,

1:55:17.220 --> 1:55:18.900
 didn't the trainer talk to you?

1:55:18.900 --> 1:55:20.220
 I said, yeah, he talked to us.

1:55:20.220 --> 1:55:22.140
 Well, he said, I can't fight.

1:55:22.140 --> 1:55:24.140
 I know, but we already talked to the trainer and.

1:55:24.140 --> 1:55:26.100
 I love it.

1:55:26.100 --> 1:55:27.700
 He said, you're good to go.

1:55:27.700 --> 1:55:29.340
 She looked at us like.

1:55:29.340 --> 1:55:31.740
 And then we had to talk to her and say, listen,

1:55:31.740 --> 1:55:34.180
 you're not injured, you're in pain

1:55:34.180 --> 1:55:35.460
 because we just came from a camp.

1:55:35.460 --> 1:55:38.020
 I said, you're in pain, but here's the deal.

1:55:38.020 --> 1:55:39.380
 We want you to fight this girl.

1:55:39.380 --> 1:55:41.220
 We want you to go out there and beat this girl, period.

1:55:41.220 --> 1:55:42.060
 I don't care.

1:55:42.060 --> 1:55:43.540
 I want to know that you can beat this girl.

1:55:43.540 --> 1:55:44.580
 This is why we came.

1:55:44.580 --> 1:55:48.300
 This is our last hard tournament before the Olympic games.

1:55:48.300 --> 1:55:50.420
 This is what we want from you.

1:55:50.420 --> 1:55:53.380
 And lo and behold, she understood.

1:55:53.380 --> 1:55:54.780
 They gave her a quick shot.

1:55:54.780 --> 1:55:56.540
 The rest of the world thought we were crazy

1:55:56.540 --> 1:55:58.660
 making her compete.

1:55:58.660 --> 1:56:01.740
 And then she went out there, she fought,

1:56:01.740 --> 1:56:03.100
 didn't even know she was injured.

1:56:03.100 --> 1:56:04.020
 No, you know what I mean?

1:56:04.020 --> 1:56:06.020
 She just went out there, she fought the tournament.

1:56:06.020 --> 1:56:07.380
 She beat the Japanese girl.

1:56:07.380 --> 1:56:09.700
 She ended up going through the whole tournament.

1:56:09.700 --> 1:56:11.500
 She took a gold medal.

1:56:11.500 --> 1:56:12.460
 She won the event.

1:56:12.460 --> 1:56:13.900
 Mm hmm.

1:56:13.900 --> 1:56:17.740
 That turned out to be a great confidence builder, yeah.

1:56:18.780 --> 1:56:21.420
 And that kind of sets you up for all the chaos

1:56:21.420 --> 1:56:23.140
 that can happen at the Olympic games.

1:56:23.140 --> 1:56:25.980
 And it tells you if you can beat these girls

1:56:25.980 --> 1:56:28.460
 when you're not 100% and you're not at your best,

1:56:28.460 --> 1:56:31.780
 you're physically beat, mentally beat,

1:56:31.780 --> 1:56:33.340
 imagine what you're gonna do when you're fresh.

1:56:33.340 --> 1:56:35.060
 Well, when she was going to the Olympic games,

1:56:35.060 --> 1:56:35.980
 there's a lot.

1:56:35.980 --> 1:56:38.260
 She had the mental game down.

1:56:38.260 --> 1:56:39.100
 Down.

1:56:39.100 --> 1:56:39.940
 Down.

1:56:39.940 --> 1:56:40.860
 There wasn't a girl in that division

1:56:40.860 --> 1:56:41.940
 that thought they could beat Kayla

1:56:41.940 --> 1:56:43.060
 going into those games.

1:56:43.060 --> 1:56:44.380
 Not a one.

1:56:44.380 --> 1:56:46.580
 They just looked at her and went, no, not happening.

1:56:46.580 --> 1:56:48.060
 Yeah, that's great.

1:56:48.060 --> 1:56:50.060
 I mean, she's a great Olympic champion,

1:56:50.060 --> 1:56:51.620
 two time Olympic champion.

1:56:51.620 --> 1:56:55.700
 But there is something that she's commented on,

1:56:55.700 --> 1:57:00.100
 which is she's suffered or went through depression

1:57:00.100 --> 1:57:02.460
 after winning her second Olympic gold.

1:57:02.460 --> 1:57:04.140
 Why do you think this happens?

1:57:04.140 --> 1:57:07.780
 You often hear stories of great champions

1:57:07.780 --> 1:57:11.020
 becoming depressed after the Olympics.

1:57:11.020 --> 1:57:14.340
 There's a lack of purpose afterwards, right?

1:57:14.340 --> 1:57:18.460
 Because you've done in life what you set out to do.

1:57:18.460 --> 1:57:20.540
 You've had a goal every day you woke up.

1:57:20.540 --> 1:57:21.900
 You knew what your purpose was.

1:57:21.900 --> 1:57:25.860
 You knew what your day looked like.

1:57:25.860 --> 1:57:27.900
 You knew why you were doing that.

1:57:27.900 --> 1:57:31.620
 And all of a sudden you won and you got all the fame

1:57:31.620 --> 1:57:33.780
 and you're all happy.

1:57:33.780 --> 1:57:37.860
 But then you wake up and you go, now what?

1:57:37.860 --> 1:57:39.420
 I don't have a next.

1:57:39.420 --> 1:57:42.100
 And also because there was nothing for her,

1:57:42.100 --> 1:57:46.500
 there was no path set out for Kayla that said,

1:57:46.500 --> 1:57:49.100
 okay, you're gonna become an ambassador,

1:57:49.100 --> 1:57:51.780
 a global ambassador of judo.

1:57:51.780 --> 1:57:54.020
 The IJF is gonna help pay a salary.

1:57:54.020 --> 1:57:56.300
 The USA judo is gonna give you a salary.

1:57:56.300 --> 1:57:58.460
 Here's what we want you to go teach children.

1:57:58.460 --> 1:58:01.020
 We want you to go be an ambassador for women.

1:58:01.020 --> 1:58:03.860
 We're gonna fly you around and whatever it is.

1:58:03.860 --> 1:58:06.460
 We're gonna give you a job and here's what you're gonna do

1:58:06.460 --> 1:58:07.580
 if you'd like to take it.

1:58:07.580 --> 1:58:08.980
 There was nothing for her.

1:58:08.980 --> 1:58:11.420
 Like I remember doing the interview at the Olympics

1:58:11.420 --> 1:58:13.780
 with her and they said, are you gonna compete

1:58:13.780 --> 1:58:14.700
 in the next Olympics?

1:58:14.700 --> 1:58:15.740
 And I said, no.

1:58:15.740 --> 1:58:16.740
 Like why?

1:58:16.740 --> 1:58:17.980
 She already two time gold medalist.

1:58:17.980 --> 1:58:19.820
 What does three time gold medalist do for her?

1:58:19.820 --> 1:58:21.260
 Nothing, right?

1:58:21.260 --> 1:58:23.900
 Doesn't motivate her to do it again.

1:58:23.900 --> 1:58:25.020
 They said, are you doing MMA?

1:58:25.020 --> 1:58:26.500
 I said, no, why would she do MMA?

1:58:26.500 --> 1:58:27.820
 That's ridiculous.

1:58:27.820 --> 1:58:29.300
 Like she doesn't need MMA.

1:58:29.300 --> 1:58:32.500
 She should be able to make a living off of what she's

1:58:32.500 --> 1:58:36.140
 accomplished in this sport for the rest of her life.

1:58:36.140 --> 1:58:39.140
 But what happens is, and what most people don't understand

1:58:39.140 --> 1:58:43.100
 is once you say I'm retired, I'm no longer competing

1:58:43.100 --> 1:58:46.980
 in the sport of judo, you don't get a salary

1:58:46.980 --> 1:58:49.980
 from USA Judo anymore, which she was getting.

1:58:51.100 --> 1:58:53.220
 I think she got like $72,000 a year

1:58:53.220 --> 1:58:55.140
 from USA Judo at the time.

1:58:56.100 --> 1:58:59.900
 You don't get a stipend from the Olympic committee anymore.

1:58:59.900 --> 1:59:01.140
 Goes away.

1:59:01.140 --> 1:59:03.460
 Your sponsor, like the New York Athletic Club

1:59:03.460 --> 1:59:05.700
 was a great sponsor for her for all those years.

1:59:05.700 --> 1:59:08.740
 In fact, she could have never been the athlete she became

1:59:08.740 --> 1:59:10.780
 without the support of the NYC.

1:59:10.780 --> 1:59:12.900
 Cause I talked to them when she was 15, I said,

1:59:12.900 --> 1:59:16.220
 hey, I got a girl that's really good someday.

1:59:16.220 --> 1:59:17.900
 Like if you invest in her now,

1:59:17.900 --> 1:59:20.100
 I promise you she'll pay back for you.

1:59:20.100 --> 1:59:22.380
 And I remember the day she won the Olympic gold,

1:59:22.380 --> 1:59:25.780
 I called the guy up, I said, hey, I told you so.

1:59:25.780 --> 1:59:28.580
 But they can no longer give you stipends

1:59:28.580 --> 1:59:30.860
 because you're not competing and representing them anymore.

1:59:30.860 --> 1:59:32.160
 So that goes away.

1:59:32.160 --> 1:59:35.160
 All of your sponsorships and all of your money

1:59:35.160 --> 1:59:37.360
 that you would make from your TV commercials or whatever,

1:59:37.360 --> 1:59:39.720
 that didn't happen for her after the Olympics

1:59:39.720 --> 1:59:41.720
 cause Judo's a obscure sport, right?

1:59:41.720 --> 1:59:44.760
 So she didn't have any opportunities for that.

1:59:44.760 --> 1:59:47.720
 At the end of the day, she has no revenue coming in.

1:59:47.720 --> 1:59:48.560
 How do you live?

1:59:48.560 --> 1:59:51.280
 You get a bonus of 25 grand from the Olympic committee

1:59:51.280 --> 1:59:53.560
 or whatever for winning a gold.

1:59:53.560 --> 1:59:55.880
 But aside from that, you're not gonna live on that money.

1:59:55.880 --> 1:59:59.000
 So no purpose, no goal, right?

1:59:59.000 --> 2:00:00.560
 What am I gonna wake up and do tomorrow?

2:00:00.560 --> 2:00:02.520
 I don't know, so she has no direction.

2:00:02.520 --> 2:00:05.440
 And then at the same time, she has no money coming in.

2:00:05.440 --> 2:00:06.680
 So everything shuts off.

2:00:06.680 --> 2:00:09.680
 So now it's like, wait till you turn, what do you do?

2:00:10.680 --> 2:00:14.240
 And that leads to being depressed because yeah,

2:00:14.240 --> 2:00:16.560
 even though I've accomplished all this stuff,

2:00:16.560 --> 2:00:17.920
 I'm kind of lost in life.

2:00:17.920 --> 2:00:20.040
 Like what's next for me?

2:00:20.040 --> 2:00:22.320
 And I guess you just have to ride that out

2:00:22.320 --> 2:00:27.320
 because when you're a great human being, great champion,

2:00:27.320 --> 2:00:31.120
 life has a way of helping you find a way.

2:00:31.120 --> 2:00:33.600
 I mean, she's in mixed martial arts now,

2:00:33.600 --> 2:00:35.400
 but she has a lot of stuff going on.

2:00:35.400 --> 2:00:40.080
 Right, well, her kids, she adopted her sister's kids.

2:00:40.080 --> 2:00:41.880
 So she's their legal guardian now.

2:00:41.880 --> 2:00:43.320
 So that is her purpose, right?

2:00:43.320 --> 2:00:46.320
 Raising these kids and making them part of her family.

2:00:46.320 --> 2:00:49.840
 And she's fortunate enough that she has enough money

2:00:49.840 --> 2:00:52.680
 that she can do that and she can give them a good life.

2:00:52.680 --> 2:00:55.200
 Mm hmm, I'm gonna ask you to start some trouble.

2:00:55.200 --> 2:00:57.360
 But I heard that she said somewhere

2:00:57.360 --> 2:01:00.720
 that she can be Khabib Nurmagomedov in judo.

2:01:00.720 --> 2:01:01.960
 What do you think?

2:01:01.960 --> 2:01:03.240
 To be honest with you, I mean,

2:01:03.240 --> 2:01:05.320
 I don't know what level of judoka.

2:01:05.320 --> 2:01:06.160
 Yeah, I don't know.

2:01:06.160 --> 2:01:07.000
 I don't know what level he is.

2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:09.720
 But I do know that that Russian system

2:01:09.720 --> 2:01:12.000
 respects judo immensely.

2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:15.200
 What I will tell you is this, I trained with Kayla

2:01:15.200 --> 2:01:18.840
 and I was an Olympic medalist and a world champion in judo.

2:01:18.840 --> 2:01:21.800
 And granted, I was older when I trained with her.

2:01:21.800 --> 2:01:23.600
 But you have to go as a man.

2:01:23.600 --> 2:01:28.280
 You have to go 100% or she will smash you as a man.

2:01:28.280 --> 2:01:30.480
 And I could tell you that if Khabib

2:01:30.480 --> 2:01:34.960
 doesn't do a lot of just judo, doesn't like gripping

2:01:34.960 --> 2:01:38.840
 and doesn't understand, if he can throw, that's one thing.

2:01:38.840 --> 2:01:42.040
 But if he doesn't really understand judo at a high level,

2:01:42.040 --> 2:01:43.720
 she will throw him.

2:01:43.720 --> 2:01:46.080
 She would beat him in a match, in a judo contest.

2:01:46.080 --> 2:01:47.800
 Not in a mixed martial arts contest,

2:01:47.800 --> 2:01:50.880
 not in a wrestling contest, not in a submission contest.

2:01:50.880 --> 2:01:52.840
 In a pure judo match.

2:01:52.840 --> 2:01:56.720
 Where he cannot grab legs and he has to grip up

2:01:56.720 --> 2:01:57.920
 and just throw.

2:01:58.920 --> 2:02:01.120
 I'd put my money on Kayla.

2:02:01.120 --> 2:02:03.600
 Unless he's, you know, if he could go place

2:02:03.600 --> 2:02:05.560
 in the nationals in Russia, he would beat her.

2:02:05.560 --> 2:02:07.320
 But if he's not at that level of judo,

2:02:07.320 --> 2:02:09.960
 he's more like a brown belt or he's not,

2:02:09.960 --> 2:02:11.960
 he's not a high level judo player, she will win.

2:02:11.960 --> 2:02:16.400
 I saw her take some of our best juniors in this country.

2:02:16.400 --> 2:02:20.240
 Some of the guys that went and won our,

2:02:20.240 --> 2:02:22.080
 medaled in our senior nationals.

2:02:22.080 --> 2:02:25.600
 I've seen her smash all of them in judo.

2:02:25.600 --> 2:02:28.480
 Now, she's not gonna do that to a Travis Stevens.

2:02:28.480 --> 2:02:33.480
 She's not gonna do that to a senior national champion

2:02:33.480 --> 2:02:35.760
 or an Olympian in our sport.

2:02:35.760 --> 2:02:39.360
 But she will go toe to toe with every other male,

2:02:39.360 --> 2:02:40.440
 black belts or not.

2:02:42.640 --> 2:02:45.240
 Speaking of Khabib in Russia,

2:02:46.640 --> 2:02:50.480
 Vladimir Putin, I don't know if you have heard of him,

2:02:50.480 --> 2:02:54.600
 he's the president of Russia, but he's also a judoka.

2:02:54.600 --> 2:02:57.400
 Have you gotten a chance to see him do judo?

2:02:57.400 --> 2:03:00.240
 What do you think about his judo, if you were to analyze it?

2:03:00.240 --> 2:03:02.320
 So I'm actually really good friends

2:03:02.320 --> 2:03:03.920
 with the Russian Federation.

2:03:05.200 --> 2:03:07.920
 The guy in charge is Ezio Gamba.

2:03:07.920 --> 2:03:10.760
 He's an Italian, he's a mastermind behind their success

2:03:10.760 --> 2:03:14.080
 of the 2012 and 2016 Olympic teams.

2:03:14.080 --> 2:03:17.560
 2020, he suffered from leukemia, blood cancer,

2:03:17.560 --> 2:03:19.920
 so he wasn't part of their 2020 program.

2:03:19.920 --> 2:03:22.400
 But he was part of 2012, 2016.

2:03:22.400 --> 2:03:24.600
 That whole national, the Olympic team in 2012

2:03:24.600 --> 2:03:29.600
 came to our studio and lived here for a month in Boston.

2:03:29.600 --> 2:03:31.000
 They went to school in Boston.

2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:32.440
 I brought them to my house.

2:03:32.440 --> 2:03:33.960
 They had three Olympic champions.

2:03:33.960 --> 2:03:36.200
 Three Olympic champions.

2:03:36.200 --> 2:03:38.360
 Oh my God, what a team.

2:03:38.360 --> 2:03:40.560
 They all came and lived here in Boston for a month.

2:03:40.560 --> 2:03:44.480
 They wanted to be part of experience America type program.

2:03:44.480 --> 2:03:48.080
 So I've seen all of them with Putin in Russia

2:03:48.080 --> 2:03:50.640
 at their national training center,

2:03:50.640 --> 2:03:52.720
 working out with them and taking falls

2:03:52.720 --> 2:03:53.640
 and doing judo with him.

2:03:53.640 --> 2:03:58.080
 So it's hard when you're older to move in judo.

2:03:58.080 --> 2:04:01.600
 I mean, I was at a high level and I'm now 51.

2:04:01.600 --> 2:04:03.520
 It's hard for me to move like I used to.

2:04:03.520 --> 2:04:06.520
 So at his age, he's gotta be what, 60,

2:04:06.520 --> 2:04:09.080
 between 62, 65ish?

2:04:09.080 --> 2:04:11.280
 I mean, it moves really well for somebody

2:04:11.280 --> 2:04:16.000
 that's that age and probably hasn't done very much judo

2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:17.840
 for the last however many years, right?

2:04:17.840 --> 2:04:19.880
 So that tells you he, at one point,

2:04:19.880 --> 2:04:21.480
 he had to be a really good judo player.

2:04:21.480 --> 2:04:23.920
 Yeah, he put in a lot of work at some point

2:04:23.920 --> 2:04:25.120
 to develop the technique.

2:04:25.120 --> 2:04:27.520
 You could tell when a great judo player,

2:04:27.520 --> 2:04:30.240
 even if they haven't practiced it,

2:04:30.240 --> 2:04:32.800
 even if they're up there in age,

2:04:32.800 --> 2:04:34.400
 like just the way they move,

2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:35.920
 the way they go in for a Seinage,

2:04:35.920 --> 2:04:38.160
 the way they go for a particular throw,

2:04:38.160 --> 2:04:40.280
 the way they do foot sweeps and all that kind of stuff,

2:04:40.280 --> 2:04:42.320
 you could just tell he's good at judo.

2:04:42.320 --> 2:04:43.920
 And that's kind of fascinating.

2:04:43.920 --> 2:04:48.240
 So it's fascinating to see political leaders.

2:04:48.240 --> 2:04:50.760
 I've gotten to interact with quite a few

2:04:50.760 --> 2:04:54.960
 for whom judo was a formative experience in their life.

2:04:54.960 --> 2:04:57.280
 And that's so interesting that for a lot of people,

2:04:57.280 --> 2:05:00.680
 judo played a big part in their life, early development.

2:05:00.680 --> 2:05:04.480
 It's similar to like if you served in the military.

2:05:04.480 --> 2:05:05.840
 There's just something about judo.

2:05:05.840 --> 2:05:09.640
 It's the, as a martial art, it's not just the technique.

2:05:09.640 --> 2:05:13.200
 So yes, there's something about gaining confidence

2:05:13.200 --> 2:05:17.080
 through becoming aware of what like your body can do,

2:05:17.080 --> 2:05:20.480
 the sort of the artistry and the skill of it,

2:05:20.480 --> 2:05:22.480
 also the power of being able to dominate

2:05:22.480 --> 2:05:24.640
 another human being with technique,

2:05:24.640 --> 2:05:28.880
 but also like the, I don't know, the formality,

2:05:28.880 --> 2:05:33.560
 the discipline of just honoring the tradition of it.

2:05:33.560 --> 2:05:36.960
 So all of that mixed together somehow creates.

2:05:36.960 --> 2:05:37.840
 Memories.

2:05:37.840 --> 2:05:40.600
 It creates memories that kind of define you

2:05:40.600 --> 2:05:42.720
 as a human being and that you carry that forward

2:05:42.720 --> 2:05:43.600
 throughout your life.

2:05:43.600 --> 2:05:45.400
 And I've just been surprised to know

2:05:45.400 --> 2:05:48.400
 how many powerful people internationally

2:05:48.400 --> 2:05:53.400
 have like in their heart, in their, who they are, judo.

2:05:53.560 --> 2:05:54.400
 For sure.

2:05:54.400 --> 2:05:55.240
 At the core of it.

2:05:55.240 --> 2:05:57.640
 It makes you the human being that you are.

2:05:57.640 --> 2:05:58.480
 It really does.

2:05:58.480 --> 2:06:01.120
 Like it becomes a fabric of,

2:06:01.120 --> 2:06:02.560
 the people that stick with it, right?

2:06:02.560 --> 2:06:03.760
 That stay with it.

2:06:03.760 --> 2:06:07.520
 Because it, I mean, it teaches you so many lessons.

2:06:07.520 --> 2:06:09.680
 It's so memorable because of what you talked about,

2:06:09.680 --> 2:06:10.640
 the tradition.

2:06:10.640 --> 2:06:14.280
 But it's also, you grow with other people,

2:06:14.280 --> 2:06:16.560
 and you learn from other people

2:06:16.560 --> 2:06:18.840
 and you experience things with other people.

2:06:18.840 --> 2:06:23.840
 It's such a hands on sport that it's very memorable.

2:06:24.160 --> 2:06:25.920
 And people love it so much.

2:06:25.920 --> 2:06:30.040
 Like right now at my dojo, we have like four generations.

2:06:30.040 --> 2:06:33.160
 Like somebody that did judo with my dad,

2:06:33.160 --> 2:06:36.000
 had a kid who trained with me,

2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:39.040
 who loved judo so much, had a kid.

2:06:39.040 --> 2:06:43.920
 That kid was now in his 20s who did judo.

2:06:43.920 --> 2:06:45.880
 And now has a kid who's two or three or four

2:06:45.880 --> 2:06:48.240
 that's coming to my toddler program at my school.

2:06:48.240 --> 2:06:49.920
 Like we're talking four generations.

2:06:49.920 --> 2:06:52.600
 And they all love the experience so much

2:06:52.600 --> 2:06:54.720
 and what it did for them and their lives

2:06:54.720 --> 2:06:56.480
 that they wanted the next generation

2:06:56.480 --> 2:06:58.160
 to also experience the same thing.

2:06:59.760 --> 2:07:00.920
 This is a tricky question,

2:07:00.920 --> 2:07:03.240
 but if people are interested in judo

2:07:03.240 --> 2:07:04.840
 and want to start learning it,

2:07:04.840 --> 2:07:08.640
 in the United States there's thousands of jiu jitsu schools,

2:07:08.640 --> 2:07:11.520
 for example, is there advice you can give

2:07:11.520 --> 2:07:13.800
 to people interested in judo

2:07:13.800 --> 2:07:18.800
 or maybe to jiu jitsu gym owners?

2:07:19.840 --> 2:07:24.840
 Like how do you get judo as part of your life in America?

2:07:25.360 --> 2:07:26.480
 Well, I mean, if you're fortunate

2:07:26.480 --> 2:07:28.880
 to live near another dojo, right?

2:07:28.880 --> 2:07:30.640
 A place that has judo locally,

2:07:30.640 --> 2:07:32.720
 then that's your best opportunity to learn

2:07:32.720 --> 2:07:35.080
 is to go learn from another school.

2:07:35.080 --> 2:07:39.240
 Unfortunately, sometimes the nearest dojo

2:07:39.240 --> 2:07:41.560
 might not be for two hours or three hours

2:07:41.560 --> 2:07:44.480
 away from where you're at, which is an obstacle.

2:07:44.480 --> 2:07:45.320
 You're not gonna do that.

2:07:45.320 --> 2:07:47.760
 So, I mean, Travis and I did start

2:07:47.760 --> 2:07:50.360
 the American Judo System online.

2:07:50.360 --> 2:07:52.840
 It's at usajudo.com.

2:07:52.840 --> 2:07:57.040
 And we've broken down every single judo technique

2:07:57.040 --> 2:08:00.360
 to the very, very basic elements of just movement.

2:08:00.360 --> 2:08:04.360
 So we teach every technique of how you do it mechanically

2:08:04.360 --> 2:08:05.760
 with just your feet,

2:08:05.760 --> 2:08:09.320
 then how you incorporate your hands and your feet together,

2:08:09.320 --> 2:08:11.120
 how you do it in all directions,

2:08:11.120 --> 2:08:13.320
 moving forward, sideways, backwards,

2:08:13.320 --> 2:08:17.080
 how to then introduce a partner into the movement,

2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:23.000
 how to do basic uchi komi or repetitions with a partner,

2:08:23.040 --> 2:08:24.440
 then moving with a partner,

2:08:24.440 --> 2:08:26.400
 then how to throw your opponent static,

2:08:26.400 --> 2:08:27.280
 how to throw your opponent.

2:08:27.280 --> 2:08:30.760
 So basically from the very foundation of the movement

2:08:30.760 --> 2:08:33.080
 all the way to the most advanced level,

2:08:33.080 --> 2:08:36.880
 we've documented this through separate videos.

2:08:36.880 --> 2:08:41.680
 And we've taken now, I think 12 to 15 of standing techniques

2:08:41.680 --> 2:08:44.560
 combined with a whole bunch of groundwork techniques.

2:08:44.560 --> 2:08:48.000
 And our goal is just to continue to build this platform out

2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:51.440
 so that anybody anywhere can learn online

2:08:51.440 --> 2:08:52.480
 and can ask questions.

2:08:52.480 --> 2:08:54.840
 We have a live training class every couple of weeks,

2:08:54.840 --> 2:08:58.520
 every two weeks, he or I answer questions online

2:08:58.520 --> 2:09:00.280
 for our members.

2:09:00.280 --> 2:09:04.560
 Ideally, what we'd like to do is have a standing curriculum

2:09:04.560 --> 2:09:07.760
 for jujitsu instructors that want to learn

2:09:07.760 --> 2:09:09.240
 and become black belts in judo.

2:09:09.240 --> 2:09:11.280
 Here's how, these are the techniques you need to know.

2:09:11.280 --> 2:09:13.200
 This is how many reps you need to do.

2:09:13.200 --> 2:09:16.440
 This is how efficient you need to get at those techniques

2:09:16.440 --> 2:09:18.960
 to become certified as an instructor

2:09:18.960 --> 2:09:20.880
 or become a black belt.

2:09:20.880 --> 2:09:23.240
 And eventually have an online promotion system

2:09:23.240 --> 2:09:26.440
 where anybody anywhere can just submit videos

2:09:26.440 --> 2:09:29.360
 and show us that they can do those techniques.

2:09:29.360 --> 2:09:31.080
 And obviously we'll have people review them.

2:09:31.080 --> 2:09:33.440
 And this is a dream and a vision,

2:09:33.440 --> 2:09:35.720
 but we've already started the platform.

2:09:35.720 --> 2:09:39.160
 We're about to do a collaborative effort with USA Judo

2:09:39.160 --> 2:09:41.160
 where all of their members will start to get access

2:09:41.160 --> 2:09:42.720
 to this platform as well.

2:09:42.720 --> 2:09:45.840
 And if we can get that influx of money

2:09:45.840 --> 2:09:49.520
 and people on the platform, it'll allow us to hire

2:09:49.520 --> 2:09:51.160
 and grow it faster.

2:09:51.160 --> 2:09:54.920
 So you also want to do certification there.

2:09:54.920 --> 2:09:56.560
 It's not just instruction.

2:09:56.560 --> 2:09:58.160
 Correct.

2:09:58.160 --> 2:09:59.840
 That would be amazing.

2:09:59.840 --> 2:10:01.240
 Yeah.

2:10:01.240 --> 2:10:02.520
 I mean, for me personally, sort of,

2:10:02.520 --> 2:10:04.680
 I mean, mostly in Austin, Texas now.

2:10:04.680 --> 2:10:05.520
 Right.

2:10:05.520 --> 2:10:10.160
 And there's a few judo schools, but it's not really.

2:10:10.160 --> 2:10:11.000
 Right.

2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:13.040
 There's not, and it's just one of those cities

2:10:13.040 --> 2:10:15.280
 that doesn't quite have, I mean, there's a few,

2:10:15.280 --> 2:10:18.160
 it's basically just like a few random judo people

2:10:18.160 --> 2:10:20.200
 that kind of kind of gather together

2:10:20.200 --> 2:10:23.840
 a couple of times a week, but it's not a system,

2:10:23.840 --> 2:10:28.840
 a dojo, an instructor, integrated into a jiu jitsu school

2:10:29.480 --> 2:10:30.520
 or not.

2:10:30.520 --> 2:10:33.920
 The problem with most judo dojos right now

2:10:33.920 --> 2:10:37.800
 is that most of them cater towards the competitive side.

2:10:39.080 --> 2:10:41.480
 Also, a lot of them do it recreationally,

2:10:41.480 --> 2:10:43.240
 meaning this isn't how they make a living.

2:10:43.240 --> 2:10:44.840
 So they're there three nights a week,

2:10:44.840 --> 2:10:45.800
 or they're there five,

2:10:45.800 --> 2:10:47.240
 even if they're there five nights a week,

2:10:47.240 --> 2:10:50.960
 it's still only one junior class and one senior class,

2:10:50.960 --> 2:10:51.800
 and that's it.

2:10:51.800 --> 2:10:53.160
 And it's one size fits all.

2:10:53.160 --> 2:10:54.600
 Doesn't matter what level you're at,

2:10:54.600 --> 2:10:55.560
 it's one size fits all.

2:10:55.560 --> 2:10:58.040
 So you can't get out of the training

2:10:58.040 --> 2:10:59.600
 what you're looking to get out of the training.

2:10:59.600 --> 2:11:01.600
 It's whatever the instructor's teaching.

2:11:03.600 --> 2:11:04.880
 And you can't learn because it's not

2:11:04.880 --> 2:11:06.280
 at the appropriate level for you.

2:11:06.280 --> 2:11:08.320
 And usually you're pushed into doing randori

2:11:08.320 --> 2:11:09.200
 where you have no choice

2:11:09.200 --> 2:11:11.360
 but to do the randori part of the training.

2:11:13.040 --> 2:11:14.600
 So it's a challenge to go learn.

2:11:14.600 --> 2:11:18.200
 And then a lot of times the schools are old school,

2:11:18.200 --> 2:11:20.240
 so they go make you do falls for a half hour.

2:11:20.240 --> 2:11:22.400
 They make you do things,

2:11:22.400 --> 2:11:23.680
 maybe you're a jujitsu person

2:11:23.680 --> 2:11:25.240
 who knows how to fall already,

2:11:25.240 --> 2:11:27.160
 but you haven't proven it to the judo instructor

2:11:27.160 --> 2:11:28.360
 and they don't break the norm

2:11:28.360 --> 2:11:30.160
 and say you still have to fall for six months,

2:11:30.160 --> 2:11:32.480
 which turns a lot of people away as well.

2:11:32.480 --> 2:11:36.120
 So it's like any business.

2:11:36.120 --> 2:11:40.880
 If you don't deliver on your customer's expectations,

2:11:40.880 --> 2:11:42.880
 you're not gonna have very many customers,

2:11:42.880 --> 2:11:44.480
 which is the way it is now.

2:11:44.480 --> 2:11:47.560
 So a lot of people who listen to this,

2:11:47.560 --> 2:11:49.120
 but in general in the United States

2:11:49.120 --> 2:11:51.320
 practice Brazilian jujitsu,

2:11:51.320 --> 2:11:54.080
 which has a lot of similarities to judo

2:11:54.080 --> 2:11:56.200
 as obviously its origins in judo.

2:11:57.360 --> 2:11:59.240
 How would you compare the two arts

2:11:59.240 --> 2:12:00.800
 from the perspective of people

2:12:00.800 --> 2:12:03.120
 just interested about both arts?

2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:07.400
 Do you recommend people who do jujitsu get into judo?

2:12:08.440 --> 2:12:10.560
 How can it enrich their jujitsu?

2:12:10.560 --> 2:12:11.920
 How do you compare the two arts,

2:12:11.920 --> 2:12:15.640
 the actual practice of it and why it might be useful to you?

2:12:15.640 --> 2:12:19.680
 I mean, I think that judo is a hard sport for adults to do.

2:12:19.680 --> 2:12:20.840
 It just is.

2:12:20.840 --> 2:12:24.440
 Especially people that haven't fallen in a long time,

2:12:24.440 --> 2:12:27.200
 aren't very athletic, haven't...

2:12:27.200 --> 2:12:29.960
 I think about my own experience, right?

2:12:29.960 --> 2:12:30.880
 Other than judo,

2:12:30.880 --> 2:12:33.760
 when did I ever do like a forward somersault?

2:12:33.760 --> 2:12:35.680
 Maybe when I was in grade school, right?

2:12:35.680 --> 2:12:39.080
 That's the last time I've left my feet was in grade school.

2:12:39.080 --> 2:12:42.760
 Most people haven't got off of a chair or a couch.

2:12:42.760 --> 2:12:45.000
 They spend eight to 10 hours a day

2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:46.400
 either working behind a computer

2:12:46.400 --> 2:12:48.800
 or sitting on their couch watching TV, right?

2:12:48.800 --> 2:12:50.560
 And they're not that athletic.

2:12:50.560 --> 2:12:51.880
 And they haven't done anything athletic

2:12:51.880 --> 2:12:55.080
 at least probably since high school, right?

2:12:55.080 --> 2:12:57.400
 That's their last athletic endeavor, most of them.

2:12:57.400 --> 2:12:59.040
 So you're talking about as an adult,

2:12:59.040 --> 2:13:01.920
 that's 35 or 40 wanting to start a sport.

2:13:01.920 --> 2:13:04.040
 Judo is a really hard sport to start,

2:13:04.040 --> 2:13:06.880
 especially in today's dojos

2:13:06.880 --> 2:13:09.720
 that don't have a recreational adult program.

2:13:09.720 --> 2:13:11.640
 You know, when it's one size fits all, it's hard.

2:13:11.640 --> 2:13:13.000
 So for those people,

2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:15.720
 jujitsu makes a heck of a lot of sense.

2:13:15.720 --> 2:13:18.800
 Good self defense, it's cerebral,

2:13:18.800 --> 2:13:21.360
 where you got to use your brain, you're a smaller person,

2:13:21.360 --> 2:13:23.160
 you have to use technique, you know,

2:13:23.160 --> 2:13:25.400
 it teaches all the same things as judo,

2:13:25.400 --> 2:13:27.040
 but it's a safe way to do it.

2:13:27.040 --> 2:13:30.120
 And because of the validation it has

2:13:30.120 --> 2:13:33.120
 with the UFC and MMA today, right?

2:13:33.120 --> 2:13:34.560
 Everybody knows jujitsu.

2:13:34.560 --> 2:13:37.120
 So now they can be part of mainstream society

2:13:37.120 --> 2:13:40.240
 and talk intelligently about what they see on television

2:13:40.240 --> 2:13:42.200
 or what's going on on ESPN today, right?

2:13:42.200 --> 2:13:43.080
 They have some knowledge.

2:13:43.080 --> 2:13:45.840
 So they have an identity.

2:13:45.840 --> 2:13:47.880
 And also there's a good culture in jujitsu

2:13:47.880 --> 2:13:49.480
 where it's becoming a family.

2:13:49.480 --> 2:13:51.400
 You know, the dojo is the family place.

2:13:51.400 --> 2:13:54.000
 You go to feel good, you go to see your friends,

2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:57.200
 you go to get fit and you have a good time, right?

2:13:57.200 --> 2:13:59.840
 So it makes a lot of sense why it's growing.

2:13:59.840 --> 2:14:01.040
 Judo on the other hand,

2:14:01.040 --> 2:14:04.480
 I think is a better sport for children to do.

2:14:04.480 --> 2:14:08.280
 It's more, I would say fun and interactive.

2:14:08.280 --> 2:14:10.160
 It's a little easier to teach the kids

2:14:10.160 --> 2:14:12.240
 how to do the throwing skills

2:14:12.240 --> 2:14:14.360
 and for safety and things like that.

2:14:14.360 --> 2:14:16.840
 Their body can handle more than the adults can.

2:14:16.840 --> 2:14:18.680
 They're less likely to get injured.

2:14:20.320 --> 2:14:21.600
 It makes them better athletes

2:14:21.600 --> 2:14:24.480
 because it's a lot more three dimensional in my opinion.

2:14:25.880 --> 2:14:27.080
 So I think there's a good fit

2:14:27.080 --> 2:14:32.080
 between judo can thrive from kids till whatever,

2:14:32.200 --> 2:14:34.160
 high school, college.

2:14:34.160 --> 2:14:37.800
 Jujitsu thrives from that 18 year old up, right?

2:14:37.800 --> 2:14:40.520
 Right now, that's kind of where it is.

2:14:40.520 --> 2:14:43.720
 So as a dojo, you have to kind of focus on the teens

2:14:43.720 --> 2:14:46.880
 and the college, like early 20s, that kind of.

2:14:46.880 --> 2:14:48.640
 Or you need to have,

2:14:48.640 --> 2:14:50.600
 if you're gonna be a successful judo dojo,

2:14:50.600 --> 2:14:53.920
 you have to have that recreational

2:14:53.920 --> 2:14:56.720
 fundamental adult program in your school

2:14:56.720 --> 2:15:00.800
 where people actually come to judo, learn the moves,

2:15:00.800 --> 2:15:03.560
 but aren't pushed into randori training

2:15:03.560 --> 2:15:05.800
 and pushed into things where they're uncomfortable

2:15:05.800 --> 2:15:07.840
 and they can't control the situation

2:15:07.840 --> 2:15:09.520
 because there's too many unknowns.

2:15:09.520 --> 2:15:12.520
 You got an education at Browns.

2:15:12.520 --> 2:15:15.440
 You're somebody, it's amazing because as an Olympian

2:15:15.440 --> 2:15:17.440
 and an Olympic coach, you always emphasize

2:15:17.440 --> 2:15:22.440
 kind of balance and education, all of that side of life.

2:15:22.440 --> 2:15:24.280
 So developing your brain too.

2:15:24.280 --> 2:15:27.640
 So you are an Olympic medalist,

2:15:27.640 --> 2:15:31.080
 a coach of Olympic medalists, you're a business owner.

2:15:31.080 --> 2:15:33.840
 So successful in all these domains.

2:15:33.840 --> 2:15:36.680
 So I have to ask, what advice would you give

2:15:36.680 --> 2:15:40.960
 to young people today, high school, judo age,

2:15:40.960 --> 2:15:43.240
 high school, college, undergrad,

2:15:44.640 --> 2:15:47.520
 how to be successful in their career

2:15:47.520 --> 2:15:48.960
 or just in life in general,

2:15:48.960 --> 2:15:51.760
 how to live a life they can be proud of?

2:15:53.920 --> 2:15:56.080
 I think you have to be true to yourself.

2:15:56.080 --> 2:15:58.840
 You have to decide what it is you really wanna do

2:15:58.840 --> 2:15:59.680
 with your life.

2:15:59.680 --> 2:16:02.280
 Like, and it's hard because when I grew up,

2:16:02.280 --> 2:16:04.200
 I didn't know I was gonna be successful.

2:16:04.200 --> 2:16:06.880
 When I was young, I didn't know I was gonna be

2:16:06.880 --> 2:16:07.720
 an Olympic medalist.

2:16:07.720 --> 2:16:10.600
 I certainly did envision myself owning a couple of companies

2:16:10.600 --> 2:16:14.320
 that makes their living exclusively from martial arts

2:16:14.320 --> 2:16:16.240
 or judo, cause that wasn't really an opportunity

2:16:16.240 --> 2:16:19.200
 when I was a kid, but I've created that opportunity.

2:16:19.200 --> 2:16:21.280
 I would just say that, pick something

2:16:21.280 --> 2:16:23.120
 that you're passionate about.

2:16:23.120 --> 2:16:24.640
 I was stuck in a career before

2:16:24.640 --> 2:16:26.480
 where I wasn't passionate about it.

2:16:26.480 --> 2:16:28.800
 And it was my wife who said, Jimmy,

2:16:28.800 --> 2:16:32.560
 if you can figure out how to make your living

2:16:32.560 --> 2:16:35.000
 exclusively from martial arts,

2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:37.440
 where your brain and your heart and your passion

2:16:37.440 --> 2:16:40.640
 is all towards one thing that you really like,

2:16:40.640 --> 2:16:41.800
 then you'll be successful.

2:16:41.800 --> 2:16:42.800
 And I left the job.

2:16:42.800 --> 2:16:43.640
 I had three kids.

2:16:43.640 --> 2:16:46.480
 I was working for monster.com.

2:16:46.480 --> 2:16:48.280
 I was in internet marketing

2:16:48.280 --> 2:16:50.080
 and I was working for that great company,

2:16:50.080 --> 2:16:51.560
 nothing wrong with the company,

2:16:51.560 --> 2:16:55.040
 but sitting behind the desk from eight till five.

2:16:55.040 --> 2:16:59.040
 And then I get to go to judo from six till nine at night.

2:16:59.040 --> 2:17:00.680
 My whole day is tied up doing something

2:17:00.680 --> 2:17:02.640
 that I'm really not passionate about.

2:17:02.640 --> 2:17:05.800
 She said, if you can figure out how to make money

2:17:05.800 --> 2:17:08.880
 from your dojo and other things judo related,

2:17:08.880 --> 2:17:10.200
 then I think you'll be successful.

2:17:10.200 --> 2:17:11.760
 And so she's the one that my wife, Marie,

2:17:11.760 --> 2:17:13.920
 gave me that advice and I would give that to others.

2:17:13.920 --> 2:17:15.720
 Find something that you love doing

2:17:15.720 --> 2:17:17.400
 where it doesn't feel like work,

2:17:17.400 --> 2:17:18.720
 something you're passionate about.

2:17:18.720 --> 2:17:20.800
 And if the opportunity doesn't exist

2:17:20.800 --> 2:17:23.680
 how to make money on it, you can create the opportunity.

2:17:23.680 --> 2:17:25.680
 Be resourceful, figure it out.

2:17:25.680 --> 2:17:28.000
 Don't let anybody tell you you can't do it.

2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:31.680
 I didn't know that I could have a 200 person judo school

2:17:31.680 --> 2:17:33.000
 that only taught judo

2:17:33.000 --> 2:17:35.800
 because that really didn't exist in this country.

2:17:35.800 --> 2:17:38.840
 That actually charges money like jujitsu charges.

2:17:38.840 --> 2:17:41.040
 We're talking not, there's plenty of clubs out there

2:17:41.040 --> 2:17:43.480
 that charge 10 bucks a month that might have 100 people,

2:17:43.480 --> 2:17:45.040
 but there's not many that,

2:17:45.040 --> 2:17:48.400
 where the tuition is $150 a month having 200 people.

2:17:48.400 --> 2:17:52.880
 So that's a successful business, but it wasn't done before.

2:17:52.880 --> 2:17:55.800
 But be passionate about it, understand you're gonna fail,

2:17:55.800 --> 2:17:58.920
 understand you're gonna get knocked down, beat up, right?

2:17:58.920 --> 2:18:01.920
 There's gonna be dark days, but you gotta persevere.

2:18:01.920 --> 2:18:03.240
 You gotta believe in yourself.

2:18:03.240 --> 2:18:04.840
 You gotta have a plan.

2:18:04.840 --> 2:18:07.840
 You have to be willing to learn from other people.

2:18:07.840 --> 2:18:09.520
 And that's what I did.

2:18:09.520 --> 2:18:12.120
 If I didn't know it, I brought somebody in to tell me,

2:18:12.120 --> 2:18:13.120
 what am I doing wrong?

2:18:13.120 --> 2:18:15.280
 Like, look from the outside, what do you see?

2:18:15.280 --> 2:18:16.120
 Okay, great.

2:18:16.120 --> 2:18:17.840
 Then you gotta be willing to change.

2:18:17.840 --> 2:18:20.040
 You gotta be willing to adapt.

2:18:20.040 --> 2:18:24.360
 And I think listening, believing in myself,

2:18:24.360 --> 2:18:26.280
 and creating opportunity.

2:18:26.280 --> 2:18:28.960
 And the other thing is helping others.

2:18:28.960 --> 2:18:33.480
 Something I always did in my judo life

2:18:33.480 --> 2:18:35.600
 and in my business life.

2:18:35.600 --> 2:18:38.320
 If somebody came to me and asked for help with,

2:18:38.320 --> 2:18:40.280
 hey man, is there something you can do to help me?

2:18:40.280 --> 2:18:42.040
 I'm trying to get this thing started.

2:18:42.040 --> 2:18:44.920
 I'm trying to get this dojo off the ground,

2:18:44.920 --> 2:18:47.120
 or I'm trying to run this event series,

2:18:47.120 --> 2:18:51.000
 or I was creative and trying to figure out a way

2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:52.480
 to help them make it work.

2:18:52.480 --> 2:18:54.560
 Because if that really was their dream,

2:18:54.560 --> 2:18:56.560
 and I could help them do their dream,

2:18:56.560 --> 2:19:00.640
 I felt like that person would then give nothing

2:19:00.640 --> 2:19:02.600
 but good, good comments about us.

2:19:02.600 --> 2:19:05.080
 Good, good, like they'll remember it forever.

2:19:05.080 --> 2:19:06.640
 They become like family.

2:19:06.640 --> 2:19:09.560
 And they'll be the best advocates for your business ever.

2:19:09.560 --> 2:19:12.200
 And so the kids that I taught at my dojo

2:19:12.200 --> 2:19:13.400
 were treated that way.

2:19:13.400 --> 2:19:15.560
 The people that worked for me get treated that way.

2:19:15.560 --> 2:19:18.600
 The people that, my customers that I work with

2:19:18.600 --> 2:19:20.800
 and building their dojos,

2:19:20.800 --> 2:19:22.600
 get treated that way.

2:19:22.600 --> 2:19:23.760
 People that ran tournaments,

2:19:23.760 --> 2:19:26.280
 whether it was Grappler's Quest years ago,

2:19:26.280 --> 2:19:28.240
 and helping that guy with a full set of mats

2:19:28.240 --> 2:19:31.040
 for his, Brian Simmons with his thing,

2:19:31.040 --> 2:19:34.720
 or any of the Gracie's.

2:19:34.720 --> 2:19:36.480
 It just became like family.

2:19:36.480 --> 2:19:38.080
 And then I just work hard and deliver

2:19:38.080 --> 2:19:39.720
 on what I say I'm gonna do.

2:19:39.720 --> 2:19:41.880
 If I say I'm gonna do it, I do it.

2:19:41.880 --> 2:19:43.560
 And I think it goes a long way.

2:19:43.560 --> 2:19:44.800
 Well, and I got a comment.

2:19:44.800 --> 2:19:48.320
 So in a small way, people may not know.

2:19:48.320 --> 2:19:49.720
 I think it's still on YouTube.

2:19:49.720 --> 2:19:52.160
 We previously talked many years ago.

2:19:52.160 --> 2:19:56.320
 And I remember it, you were so kind to me.

2:19:56.320 --> 2:19:58.200
 And you didn't really know who I was.

2:19:58.200 --> 2:20:00.360
 You just took me as a human being.

2:20:00.360 --> 2:20:01.880
 You welcomed me into your dojo.

2:20:01.880 --> 2:20:04.400
 And we just had a conversation on a podcast

2:20:04.400 --> 2:20:06.320
 or whatever the heck you call that thing.

2:20:06.320 --> 2:20:08.440
 And you were just very kind.

2:20:08.440 --> 2:20:11.480
 And you were also just,

2:20:12.920 --> 2:20:15.600
 it was the last conversation I had

2:20:15.600 --> 2:20:17.840
 when I showed up to MIT,

2:20:17.840 --> 2:20:20.200
 and it stayed with me.

2:20:20.200 --> 2:20:23.120
 So I've resumed doing this podcast.

2:20:23.120 --> 2:20:24.920
 But it stayed with me because you said

2:20:26.720 --> 2:20:28.960
 that I did a good job at this.

2:20:28.960 --> 2:20:30.960
 And people, especially at that time,

2:20:30.960 --> 2:20:32.560
 didn't tell me that.

2:20:33.680 --> 2:20:36.200
 And just that little act of kindness

2:20:36.200 --> 2:20:38.080
 is probably just a regular part of your day.

2:20:38.080 --> 2:20:40.080
 You had a busy day, it was the end of the day.

2:20:40.080 --> 2:20:42.760
 Just saying that, that was powerful.

2:20:42.760 --> 2:20:45.000
 And that pays off somehow.

2:20:45.000 --> 2:20:47.120
 So thank you for that.

2:20:47.120 --> 2:20:49.560
 Yeah, but it was sincere, right?

2:20:49.560 --> 2:20:50.400
 It was genuine.

2:20:50.400 --> 2:20:53.320
 I felt like I had been to so many interviews.

2:20:53.320 --> 2:20:54.840
 When it's around the Olympic time,

2:20:54.840 --> 2:20:56.800
 there's lots of beat reporters that come out

2:20:56.800 --> 2:20:58.200
 and they're trying to get your time.

2:20:58.200 --> 2:21:01.360
 And they're there because they have to get the story

2:21:01.360 --> 2:21:03.600
 for their newspaper or their television show.

2:21:03.600 --> 2:21:06.160
 And a lot of times those people show up, right?

2:21:06.160 --> 2:21:08.840
 And they pronounce my name wrong.

2:21:08.840 --> 2:21:10.880
 Or they get something wrong about the background.

2:21:10.880 --> 2:21:14.880
 Or they offend me because they call me for the wrong reason.

2:21:14.880 --> 2:21:16.960
 Or they call me five minutes before

2:21:16.960 --> 2:21:18.200
 that they're supposed to be there and say,

2:21:18.200 --> 2:21:19.440
 oh, sorry, we're running late.

2:21:19.440 --> 2:21:20.520
 We'll be there in an hour and a half.

2:21:20.520 --> 2:21:22.440
 Well, I'm a busy guy too.

2:21:22.440 --> 2:21:25.440
 But you were somebody that showed up,

2:21:25.440 --> 2:21:27.120
 was so prepared with your notes,

2:21:27.120 --> 2:21:32.120
 knew everything about the history of what I had done.

2:21:32.120 --> 2:21:34.920
 The questions you asked were intelligent questions.

2:21:34.920 --> 2:21:36.400
 They were well thought out.

2:21:36.400 --> 2:21:38.440
 And at the end of that interview,

2:21:38.440 --> 2:21:41.400
 I was really genuinely impressed.

2:21:41.400 --> 2:21:43.960
 And I wanted to let you know you did a great job

2:21:43.960 --> 2:21:45.240
 and you stood out from the rest.

2:21:45.240 --> 2:21:46.080
 Thank you.

2:21:46.080 --> 2:21:46.920
 Yeah.

2:21:46.920 --> 2:21:48.640
 I mean, for me, it was like showing up to like the Mecca,

2:21:48.640 --> 2:21:49.480
 like the track.

2:21:49.480 --> 2:21:51.240
 I mean, I didn't, you know,

2:21:51.240 --> 2:21:53.200
 you don't always want to just tell that to people,

2:21:53.200 --> 2:21:55.400
 but you show up, you know,

2:21:55.400 --> 2:21:58.720
 obviously you're the legend of judo in the United States.

2:21:58.720 --> 2:22:01.640
 And so that was like, Boston is the Mecca.

2:22:01.640 --> 2:22:02.960
 Right.

2:22:02.960 --> 2:22:06.640
 I think that's where you travel to talk to the great.

2:22:06.640 --> 2:22:09.200
 So the fact that you were kind to me

2:22:09.200 --> 2:22:11.040
 just stuck with me for a long time.

2:22:11.040 --> 2:22:14.680
 So it pays off to be kind to others,

2:22:14.680 --> 2:22:19.680
 to give them a chance.

2:22:20.080 --> 2:22:23.240
 Jimmy, thank you so much for giving me another chance

2:22:23.240 --> 2:22:24.680
 and spending your valuable time.

2:22:24.680 --> 2:22:27.440
 And you've also were kind enough to invite me

2:22:27.440 --> 2:22:30.120
 to train with you today at your dojo.

2:22:30.120 --> 2:22:31.400
 So I can't wait.

2:22:31.400 --> 2:22:32.240
 Let's go.

2:22:32.240 --> 2:22:33.080
 Let's go do some judo.

2:22:33.080 --> 2:22:33.920
 Yeah, awesome.

2:22:33.920 --> 2:22:35.440
 Thank you, Lex.

2:22:35.440 --> 2:22:38.520
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jimmy Pedro.

2:22:38.520 --> 2:22:41.400
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors

2:22:41.400 --> 2:22:43.040
 in the description.

2:22:43.040 --> 2:22:46.240
 And now let me leave you some words from Bruce Lee.

2:22:46.240 --> 2:22:50.560
 I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once,

2:22:50.560 --> 2:22:55.400
 but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.

2:22:55.400 --> 2:23:07.920
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
