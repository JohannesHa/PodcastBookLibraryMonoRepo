00:00.000 --> 00:03.800
 The following is a conversation with S. James Gates, Jr.

00:03.800 --> 00:07.300
 He's a theoretical physicist and professor at Brown University,

00:07.300 --> 00:11.460
 working on supersymmetry, supergravity, and superstring theory.

00:11.460 --> 00:16.500
 He served on former President Obama's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology,

00:16.500 --> 00:21.600
 and he's now the coauthor of a new book titled Proving Einstein Right,

00:21.600 --> 00:26.500
 about the scientists who set out to prove Einstein's theory of relativity.

00:26.500 --> 00:30.200
 You may have noticed that I've been speaking with not just computer scientists,

00:30.200 --> 00:35.200
 but philosophers, mathematicians, physicists, economists, and soon, much more.

00:35.200 --> 00:39.300
 To me, AI is much bigger than deep learning, bigger than computing.

00:39.300 --> 00:43.000
 It is our civilization's journey into understanding the human mind

00:43.000 --> 00:45.700
 and creating echoes of it in the machine.

00:45.700 --> 00:50.300
 That journey includes, of course, the world of theoretical physics

00:50.300 --> 00:53.300
 and its practice of first principles mathematical thinking

00:53.300 --> 00:57.500
 and exploring the fundamental nature of our reality.

00:57.500 --> 01:00.500
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:00.500 --> 01:04.600
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, give it five stars on Apple Podcast,

01:04.600 --> 01:07.300
 follow on Spotify, support on Patreon,

01:07.300 --> 01:13.400
 or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman, spelled F.R.I.D.M.A.N.

01:13.400 --> 01:17.100
 If you leave a review on Apple Podcasts or YouTube or Twitter,

01:17.100 --> 01:20.500
 consider mentioning ideas, people, topics you find interesting.

01:20.500 --> 01:23.100
 It helps guide the future of this podcast.

01:23.100 --> 01:28.600
 But in general, I just love comments that are full of kindness and thoughtfulness in them.

01:28.600 --> 01:32.800
 This podcast is a side project for me, but I still put a lot of effort into it.

01:32.800 --> 01:39.600
 So the positive words of support from an amazing community, from you, really help.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.500
 I recently started doing ads at the end of the introduction.

01:42.500 --> 01:45.100
 I'll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode

01:45.100 --> 01:48.900
 and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation.

01:48.900 --> 01:52.600
 I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

01:52.600 --> 01:56.400
 I provide timestamps for the start of the conversations you may have noticed

01:56.400 --> 02:00.100
 that you can skip to, but it helps if you listen to the ad

02:00.100 --> 02:05.300
 and support this podcast by trying out the product or service being advertised.

02:05.300 --> 02:10.100
 This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.

02:10.100 --> 02:12.500
 I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,

02:12.500 --> 02:16.800
 but you can also use it to buy, sell, and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.700
 Cash App also has a new investing feature.

02:19.700 --> 02:25.200
 You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth, no matter what the stock price is.

02:25.200 --> 02:28.100
 Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,

02:28.100 --> 02:31.100
 a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.

02:31.100 --> 02:33.100
 I'm excited to be working with Cash App

02:33.100 --> 02:36.200
 to support one of my favorite organizations called First,

02:36.200 --> 02:39.600
 best known for their first robotics and Lego competitions.

02:39.600 --> 02:43.100
 They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students

02:43.100 --> 02:47.300
 in over 110 countries and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,

02:47.300 --> 02:51.200
 which means the donated money is used to maximum effectiveness.

02:51.200 --> 02:54.000
 When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play

02:54.000 --> 02:57.700
 and use code LEXPODCAST, you'll get $10,

02:57.700 --> 03:00.600
 and Cash App will also donate $10 to First,

03:00.600 --> 03:05.400
 which again is an organization that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys

03:05.400 --> 03:08.400
 to dream of engineering a better world.

03:08.400 --> 03:13.600
 And now, here's my conversation with S. James Gates Jr.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.500
 You tell a story when you were eight.

03:15.500 --> 03:18.200
 You had a profound realization that the stars in the sky

03:18.200 --> 03:22.500
 are actually places that we could travel to one day.

03:22.500 --> 03:27.200
 Do you think human beings will ever venture outside our solar system?

03:27.200 --> 03:30.500
 Wow, the question of whether humanity gets outside of the solar system.

03:30.500 --> 03:31.800
 It's going to be a challenge,

03:31.800 --> 03:38.300
 and as long as the laws of physics that we have today are accurate and valid,

03:38.300 --> 03:40.800
 it's going to be extraordinarily difficult.

03:40.800 --> 03:43.400
 I'm a science fiction fan, as you probably know,

03:43.400 --> 03:48.100
 so I love to dream of starships and traveling to other solar systems,

03:48.100 --> 03:52.500
 but the barriers are just formidable.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.300
 If we just kind of venture a little bit into science fiction,

03:55.300 --> 03:58.100
 do you think the spaceships, if we are successful,

03:58.100 --> 04:00.400
 that take us outside the solar system,

04:00.400 --> 04:03.000
 will look like the ones we have today,

04:03.000 --> 04:07.500
 or are fundamental breakthroughs necessary?

04:07.500 --> 04:10.100
 In order to have genuine starships,

04:10.100 --> 04:14.900
 probably some really radical views about the way the universe works

04:14.900 --> 04:17.900
 are going to have to take place in our science.

04:17.900 --> 04:22.200
 We could, with our current technology,

04:22.200 --> 04:25.500
 think about constructing multigenerational starships

04:25.500 --> 04:31.200
 where the people who get on them are not the people who get off at the other end.

04:31.200 --> 04:36.500
 But even if we do that, the formidable problem is actually our bodies,

04:36.500 --> 04:41.100
 which doesn't seem to be conscious for a lot of people.

04:41.100 --> 04:44.000
 Even getting to Mars is going to present this challenge,

04:44.000 --> 04:47.300
 because we live in this wonderful home,

04:47.300 --> 04:50.700
 has a protective magnetic magnetosphere around it,

04:50.700 --> 04:54.100
 and so we're shielded from cosmic radiation.

04:54.100 --> 04:58.800
 Once you leave this shield, there are some estimates that,

04:58.800 --> 05:02.100
 for example, if you sent someone to Mars,

05:02.100 --> 05:05.700
 with our technology, probably about two years out there without the shield,

05:05.700 --> 05:07.000
 they're going to be bombarded.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.200
 That means radiation, probably means cancer.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.900
 So that's one of the most formidable challenges,

05:12.900 --> 05:16.300
 even if we could get over the technology.

05:16.300 --> 05:19.300
 Do you think, so Mars is a harsh place.

05:19.300 --> 05:22.800
 Elon Musk, SpaceX and other folks,

05:22.800 --> 05:25.900
 NASA are really pushing to put a human being on Mars.

05:25.900 --> 05:28.500
 Do you think, again, let's forgive me

05:28.500 --> 05:31.300
 for lingering in science fiction land for a little bit.

05:31.300 --> 05:34.400
 Do you think one day we may be able to colonize Mars?

05:34.400 --> 05:37.800
 First, do you think we'll put a human on Mars,

05:37.800 --> 05:40.700
 and then do you think we'll put many humans on Mars?

05:40.700 --> 05:45.500
 So first of all, I am extraordinarily convinced

05:45.500 --> 05:48.100
 we will not put a human on Mars by 2030,

05:48.100 --> 05:52.100
 which is a date that you often hear in the public debate.

05:52.100 --> 05:53.500
 What's the challenge there?

05:53.500 --> 05:54.300
 What do you think?

05:54.300 --> 05:56.600
 So there are a couple of ways that I could slice this,

05:56.600 --> 06:01.000
 but the one that I think is simplest for people to understand involves money.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.500
 So you look at how we got to the moon in the 1960s.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.100
 It was about 10 year duration

06:07.100 --> 06:10.300
 between the challenge that President Kennedy laid out

06:10.300 --> 06:12.700
 and our successfully landing a moon.

06:12.700 --> 06:14.400
 I was actually here at MIT

06:14.400 --> 06:16.600
 when that first moon landing occurred,

06:16.600 --> 06:18.300
 so I remember watching it on TV.

06:18.300 --> 06:19.200
 But how did we get there?

06:19.200 --> 06:24.700
 Well, we had this extraordinarily technical agency

06:24.700 --> 06:26.900
 of the United States government, NASA.

06:26.900 --> 06:32.700
 It consumed about 5% of the country's economic output.

06:32.700 --> 06:35.800
 And so you say 5% of the economic output

06:35.800 --> 06:40.400
 over about a 10 year period gets us 250,000 miles in space.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.500
 Mars is about a hundred times farther.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.500
 So you have at least a hundred times the challenge

06:45.500 --> 06:48.600
 and we're spending about one tenth of the funds

06:48.600 --> 06:50.800
 that we spent then as a government.

06:50.800 --> 06:54.400
 So my claim is that it's at least a thousand times harder

06:54.400 --> 06:58.000
 for me to imagine us getting to Mars by 2030.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.400
 And he had that part that you mentioned in the speech

07:00.400 --> 07:03.900
 that I just have to throw in there of JFK,

07:03.900 --> 07:06.100
 of we do these things not because they're easy,

07:06.100 --> 07:07.800
 but because they're hard.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.100
 That's such a beautiful line

07:09.100 --> 07:11.900
 that I would love to hear a modern president say

07:11.900 --> 07:13.700
 about a scientific endeavor.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.300
 Well, one day we live and hope

07:16.300 --> 07:19.700
 that such a president will arise for our nation.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.100
 But even if, like I said,

07:21.100 --> 07:24.900
 even if you fix the technical problems,

07:24.900 --> 07:28.900
 the biological engineering that I worry most about,

07:28.900 --> 07:31.900
 however, I'm gonna go out on a limb here.

07:31.900 --> 07:35.800
 I think that by 2090 or so,

07:35.800 --> 07:40.800
 or 2100, should I say 120,

07:41.300 --> 07:44.000
 I suspect we're gonna have a human on Mars.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.400
 Wow, so you think that many years out,

07:46.400 --> 07:48.000
 first a few tangents.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.500
 You said bioengineering is a challenge.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.400
 What's the challenge there?

07:52.400 --> 07:57.400
 So as I said, the real problem with interstellar travel,

07:57.800 --> 08:00.800
 aside from the technology challenges,

08:00.800 --> 08:03.200
 the real problem is radiation.

08:03.200 --> 08:08.200
 And how do you engineer either an environment or a body,

08:08.700 --> 08:12.900
 because we see rapid advances going on in bioengineering,

08:12.900 --> 08:16.400
 how do you engineer either a ship or a body

08:16.400 --> 08:18.900
 so that something, some person

08:18.900 --> 08:22.200
 that's recognizably human will survive

08:22.200 --> 08:24.600
 the rigors of interplanetary space travel?

08:24.600 --> 08:26.500
 It's much more difficult than most people

08:26.500 --> 08:28.200
 seem to take into account.

08:29.500 --> 08:34.500
 So if we could linger on the 2090, 2100, 2120,

08:36.200 --> 08:38.900
 sort of thinking of that kind of,

08:40.100 --> 08:42.900
 you know, and let's linger on money.

08:42.900 --> 08:43.740
 Okay.

08:43.740 --> 08:48.900
 So Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are pushing the cost,

08:48.900 --> 08:50.600
 trying to push the cost down.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.900
 I mean, this is, so do you have hope

08:52.900 --> 08:56.600
 as this actually sort of a brilliant big picture scientist,

08:56.600 --> 09:01.600
 do you think a business entrepreneur can take science

09:02.040 --> 09:04.900
 and make it cheaper and get it out there faster?

09:04.900 --> 09:06.800
 So bending the cost curve is,

09:06.800 --> 09:08.500
 you'll notice that has been an anchor.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.600
 This is the simplest way for me to discuss this with people

09:10.600 --> 09:12.100
 about what the challenge is.

09:12.100 --> 09:16.200
 So yes, bending the cost curve is certainly critical

09:16.200 --> 09:18.200
 if we're going to be successful.

09:18.200 --> 09:22.900
 Now, you asked about the endeavors that are out there now

09:22.900 --> 09:25.300
 sponsored by two very prominent American citizens,

09:25.300 --> 09:28.000
 Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.600
 I'm disappointed actually in what I see

09:31.600 --> 09:35.200
 in terms of the routes that are being pursued.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.700
 So let me give you one example there.

09:36.700 --> 09:39.600
 And this one is going to be a little bit more technical.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.400
 So if you look at the kinds of rockets

09:41.400 --> 09:45.100
 that both these organizations are creating,

09:45.100 --> 09:47.300
 yes, it's wonderful, reusable technology

09:47.300 --> 09:50.000
 to see a rocket go up and land on its fins

09:50.000 --> 09:51.800
 just like it did in science fiction movies

09:51.800 --> 09:54.500
 when I was a kid, that's astounding.

09:54.500 --> 09:58.900
 But the real problem is those rockets,

09:58.900 --> 10:00.300
 the technology that we're doing now

10:00.300 --> 10:02.100
 is not really that different

10:02.100 --> 10:04.400
 than what was used to go to the moon.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.600
 And there are alternatives it turns out.

10:06.600 --> 10:09.000
 There's an engine called a flare engine,

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
 which so a traditional rocket,

10:11.000 --> 10:13.200
 if you look at the engine, it looks like a bell, right?

10:13.200 --> 10:14.900
 And then the flame comes out the bottom.

10:14.900 --> 10:17.300
 But there is a kind of engine called a flare engine,

10:17.300 --> 10:20.200
 which is essentially, when you look at it,

10:20.200 --> 10:23.800
 it looks like an exhaust pipe

10:23.800 --> 10:27.600
 on like a fancy car that's long and elongated.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.000
 And it's a type of rocket engine

10:29.000 --> 10:32.800
 that we know there've been preliminary testing,

10:32.800 --> 10:34.100
 we know it works.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.700
 And it also is actually much more economical

10:36.700 --> 10:38.700
 because what it does is allow you

10:38.700 --> 10:40.900
 to vary the amount of thrust as you go up.

10:40.900 --> 10:42.200
 In a way that you cannot do

10:42.200 --> 10:44.300
 with one of these bell shaped engines.

10:44.300 --> 10:48.800
 So you would think that an entrepreneur

10:48.800 --> 10:53.500
 might try to have the breakthrough to use flare nozzles,

10:53.500 --> 10:56.600
 as they're called, as a way to bend the cost curve.

10:56.600 --> 10:57.600
 Because as we keep coming back,

10:57.600 --> 10:59.200
 that's gonna be a big factor.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.600
 But that's not happening.

11:00.600 --> 11:04.600
 In fact, what we see is what I think of as incremental change

11:04.600 --> 11:06.200
 in terms of our technology.

11:06.200 --> 11:10.200
 So I'm not really very encouraged by what I personally see.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.500
 So incremental change won't bend the cost curve.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.200
 I don't see it.

11:14.200 --> 11:17.400
 Just linger on the sci fi for one more question.

11:17.400 --> 11:18.900
 Sure.

11:18.900 --> 11:20.900
 Do you think we're alone in the universe?

11:20.900 --> 11:23.800
 Are we the only intelligent form of life?

11:23.800 --> 11:27.000
 So there is a quote by Carl Sagan,

11:27.000 --> 11:30.300
 which I really love when I hear this question.

11:30.300 --> 11:32.400
 And I recall the quote,

11:32.400 --> 11:34.000
 and it goes something like,

11:34.000 --> 11:38.500
 if we're the only conscious life in the universe,

11:38.500 --> 11:40.800
 it's in a terrible waste of space

11:40.800 --> 11:45.000
 because the universe is an incredibly big place.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.200
 And when Carl made that statement,

11:47.200 --> 11:50.400
 we didn't know about the profusion of planets

11:50.400 --> 11:51.600
 that are out there.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.200
 In the last decade,

11:53.200 --> 11:56.100
 we've discovered over a thousand planets

11:56.100 --> 11:59.600
 and a substantial number of those planets are Earth like

11:59.600 --> 12:04.100
 in terms of being in the Goldilocks zone as it's called.

12:04.100 --> 12:09.100
 So in my mind, it's practically inconceivable

12:09.100 --> 12:13.400
 that we're the only conscious form of life in the universe.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.800
 But that doesn't mean they've come to visit us.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.000
 Do you think they would look,

12:17.000 --> 12:21.200
 do you think we'll recognize alien life if we saw it?

12:21.200 --> 12:24.100
 Do you think it'd look anything like the carbon base,

12:24.100 --> 12:27.100
 the biological system we have on Earth today?

12:27.100 --> 12:31.100
 It would depend on that life's native environment

12:31.100 --> 12:32.600
 in which it arose.

12:32.600 --> 12:36.300
 If that environment was sufficiently like our environment,

12:36.300 --> 12:39.200
 there's a principle in biology and nature called convergence,

12:39.200 --> 12:42.300
 which is that even if you have two biological systems

12:42.300 --> 12:44.600
 that are totally separated from each other,

12:44.600 --> 12:46.900
 if they face similar conditions,

12:46.900 --> 12:49.400
 nature tends to converge on solutions.

12:49.400 --> 12:52.000
 And so there might be similarities

12:52.000 --> 12:55.600
 if this alien life form was born in a place

12:55.600 --> 12:57.800
 that's kind of like this place.

12:57.800 --> 13:00.600
 Physics appears to be quite similar,

13:00.600 --> 13:03.900
 the laws of physics across the entirety of the universe.

13:03.900 --> 13:06.900
 Do you think weirder things than we see on Earth

13:06.900 --> 13:10.300
 can spring up out of the same kinds of laws of physics?

13:10.300 --> 13:12.800
 From the laws of physics, I would say yes.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.500
 First of all, if you look at carbon based life,

13:14.500 --> 13:15.600
 why are we carbon based?

13:15.600 --> 13:18.200
 Well, it turns out it's because of the way

13:18.200 --> 13:20.100
 that carbon interacts with elements,

13:20.100 --> 13:22.200
 which in fact is also a reflection

13:22.200 --> 13:26.600
 on the electronic structure of the carbon nucleus.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.200
 So you can look down the table of elements and say,

13:28.200 --> 13:30.400
 well, gee, do we see similar elements?

13:30.400 --> 13:31.400
 The answer is yes.

13:31.400 --> 13:34.100
 And one that one often hears about

13:34.100 --> 13:36.200
 in science fiction is silicon.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.500
 So maybe there's a silicon based life form out there

13:38.500 --> 13:40.200
 if the conditions are right.

13:40.200 --> 13:41.700
 But I think it's presumptuous of us

13:41.700 --> 13:44.300
 to think that we are the template

13:44.300 --> 13:47.500
 by which all life has to appear.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.900
 Before we dive into beautiful details,

13:52.900 --> 13:55.200
 let me ask a big question.

13:55.200 --> 13:58.200
 What to you is the most beautiful idea,

13:58.200 --> 14:02.000
 maybe the most surprising, mysterious idea in physics?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.400
 The most surprising idea to me

14:03.400 --> 14:05.700
 is that we can actually do physics.

14:05.700 --> 14:08.800
 The universe did not have to be constructed

14:08.800 --> 14:13.600
 in such a way with our limited intellectual capacity

14:13.600 --> 14:17.600
 that is actually put together in such a way

14:17.600 --> 14:20.200
 and that we are put together in such a way

14:20.200 --> 14:24.200
 that we can, with our mind's eye,

14:24.200 --> 14:27.500
 delve incredibly deeply into the structure of the universe.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.800
 That to me is pretty close to a miracle.

14:30.800 --> 14:34.400
 So there are simple equations, relatively simple,

14:34.400 --> 14:40.000
 that can describe things, the fundamental functions.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.600
 They can describe everything about our reality.

14:42.600 --> 14:46.000
 That's not, can you imagine universes

14:46.000 --> 14:50.500
 where everything is a lot more complicated?

14:50.500 --> 14:54.800
 Do you think there's something inherent about universes

14:54.800 --> 14:57.600
 that simple laws are...

14:57.600 --> 14:58.900
 Well, first of all, let me,

14:58.900 --> 15:02.200
 this is a question that I encounter in a number of guides.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.200
 A lot of people will raise the question

15:04.200 --> 15:08.000
 about whether mathematics is the language of the universe.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.200
 And my response is mathematics is the language

15:11.200 --> 15:14.700
 that we humans are capable of using in describing the universe.

15:14.700 --> 15:17.300
 It may have little to do with the universe,

15:17.300 --> 15:20.700
 but in terms of our capacity, it's the microscope,

15:20.700 --> 15:22.800
 it's the telescope through which we,

15:22.800 --> 15:26.400
 it's the lens through which we are able to view the universe

15:26.400 --> 15:31.400
 with the precision that no other human language allows.

15:31.400 --> 15:32.900
 So could there be other universes?

15:32.900 --> 15:36.800
 Well, I don't even know if this one looks like I think it does.

15:36.800 --> 15:43.000
 But the beautiful surprising thing is that physics,

15:43.000 --> 15:46.800
 there are laws of physics, very few laws of physics

15:46.800 --> 15:48.900
 that can effectively compress down

15:48.900 --> 15:50.200
 the functioning of the universe.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.700
 Yes, that's extraordinarily surprising.

15:52.700 --> 15:54.000
 I like to use the analogy

15:54.000 --> 15:56.800
 with computers and information technology.

15:56.800 --> 16:01.000
 If you worry about transmitting large bundles of data,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.200
 one of the things that computer scientists do for us

16:03.200 --> 16:06.400
 is they allow for processes that are called compression,

16:06.400 --> 16:07.900
 where you take big packets of data

16:07.900 --> 16:10.300
 and you press them down into much smaller packets,

16:10.300 --> 16:11.400
 and then you transmit those

16:11.400 --> 16:13.400
 and then unpack them at the other end.

16:13.400 --> 16:16.000
 And so it looks a little bit to me

16:16.000 --> 16:18.500
 like the universe has kind of done us a favor.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.600
 It's constructed our minds in such a way

16:20.600 --> 16:23.100
 that we have this thing called mathematics,

16:23.100 --> 16:24.700
 which then as we look at the universe,

16:24.700 --> 16:29.600
 teaches us how to carry out the compression process.

16:29.600 --> 16:31.600
 A quick question about compression.

16:31.600 --> 16:35.100
 Do you think the human mind can be compressed?

16:35.100 --> 16:38.000
 The biology can be compressed?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
 We talked about space travel.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.400
 To be able to compress the information

16:42.400 --> 16:46.000
 that captures some large percent of what it means

16:46.000 --> 16:48.700
 to be me or you,

16:48.700 --> 16:52.600
 and then be able to send that at the speed of light.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.300
 Wow, that's a big question.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.900
 And let me try to take it apart,

16:56.900 --> 16:58.900
 unpack it into several pieces.

16:58.900 --> 17:02.700
 I don't believe that wetware biology such as we are

17:02.700 --> 17:08.000
 has an exclusive patent on intellectual consciousness.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.500
 I suspect that other structures in the universe

17:11.500 --> 17:14.700
 are perfectly capable of producing the data streams

17:14.700 --> 17:17.300
 that we use to process, first of all,

17:17.300 --> 17:18.700
 our observations of the universe

17:18.700 --> 17:20.700
 and an awareness of ourself.

17:20.700 --> 17:23.300
 I can imagine other structures can do that also.

17:23.300 --> 17:26.600
 So that's part of what you were talking about,

17:26.600 --> 17:30.500
 which I would have some disagreement with.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.600
 Consciousness.

17:31.600 --> 17:36.200
 What's the most interesting part of us humans?

17:36.200 --> 17:38.000
 Is consciousness the thing?

17:38.000 --> 17:39.900
 I think that's the most interesting thing about humans.

17:39.900 --> 17:43.700
 And then you're saying that there's other entities

17:43.700 --> 17:45.100
 throughout the universe.

17:45.100 --> 17:48.200
 I can well imagine that the architecture

17:48.200 --> 17:50.800
 that supports our consciousness, again,

17:50.800 --> 17:53.800
 has no patent on consciousness.

17:53.800 --> 17:57.700
 Just in case you have an interesting thought here,

17:57.700 --> 18:01.500
 there's folks perhaps in philosophy called panpsychists

18:01.500 --> 18:04.100
 that believe consciousness underlies everything.

18:04.100 --> 18:07.000
 It is one of the fundamental laws of the universe.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.700
 Do you have a sense that that could possibly fit into...

18:09.700 --> 18:12.100
 I don't know the answer to that question.

18:12.100 --> 18:15.800
 One part of that belief system is giya,

18:15.800 --> 18:18.500
 which is that there's a kind of conscious life force

18:18.500 --> 18:20.300
 about our planet.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.800
 And I've encountered these things before.

18:22.800 --> 18:25.200
 I don't quite know what to make of them.

18:25.200 --> 18:30.300
 My own life experience, and I'll be 69 in about two months,

18:30.300 --> 18:33.000
 and I have spent all my adulthood thinking about

18:33.000 --> 18:37.400
 the way that mathematics interacts with nature

18:37.400 --> 18:39.800
 and with us to try to understand nature.

18:39.800 --> 18:43.800
 And all I can tell you from all of my integrated experience

18:43.800 --> 18:47.300
 is that there is something extraordinarily mysterious

18:47.300 --> 18:48.500
 to me about our universe.

18:48.500 --> 18:51.100
 This is something that Einstein said

18:51.100 --> 18:53.300
 from his life experience as a scientist.

18:53.300 --> 18:58.300
 And this mysteriousness almost feels

18:59.800 --> 19:03.300
 like the universe is our parent.

19:03.300 --> 19:07.300
 It's a very strange thing perhaps to hear scientists say,

19:07.300 --> 19:10.100
 but there are just so many strange coincidences

19:10.100 --> 19:13.500
 that you just get a sense that something is going on.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.300
 Well, I interrupted you.

19:16.300 --> 19:19.900
 In terms of compressing what we're down to,

19:19.900 --> 19:21.800
 we can send it at the speed of light.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.300
 Yes.

19:23.300 --> 19:26.800
 So the first thing is I would argue that it's probably

19:26.800 --> 19:30.100
 very likely that artificial intelligence

19:30.100 --> 19:32.600
 ultimately will develop something like consciousness,

19:32.600 --> 19:35.200
 something that for us will probably be indistinguishable

19:35.200 --> 19:36.500
 from consciousness.

19:36.500 --> 19:41.500
 So that's what I meant by our biological processing equipment

19:41.600 --> 19:44.100
 that we carry up here probably does not hold a patent

19:44.100 --> 19:46.200
 on consciousness, because it's really

19:46.200 --> 19:48.100
 about the data streams.

19:48.100 --> 19:49.500
 As far as I can tell, that's what we are.

19:49.500 --> 19:53.700
 We are self actuating, self learning data streams.

19:53.700 --> 19:56.300
 That to me is most accurate way I can tell you

19:56.300 --> 19:59.700
 what I've seen in my lifetime about what humans are

19:59.700 --> 20:01.200
 at the level of consciousness.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.600
 So if that's the case, then you just need to have

20:03.600 --> 20:06.600
 an architecture that supports that information processing.

20:06.600 --> 20:09.000
 So let's assume that that's true,

20:09.000 --> 20:13.800
 that in fact what we call consciousness is really about

20:13.800 --> 20:17.200
 a very peculiar kind of data stream.

20:17.200 --> 20:21.400
 If that's the case, then if you can export that

20:21.400 --> 20:25.500
 to a piece of hardware, something metal,

20:25.500 --> 20:29.500
 electronic, what have you, then you certainly will,

20:29.500 --> 20:32.400
 ultimately that kind of consciousness could get to Mars

20:32.400 --> 20:35.000
 very quickly, it doesn't have our problems.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.800
 You can engineer the body, as I said,

20:36.800 --> 20:39.200
 it's a ship or a body, you engineer one or both.

20:41.300 --> 20:44.100
 Send it at a speed of light, well,

20:44.100 --> 20:47.400
 that one is a more difficult one because that now

20:47.400 --> 20:49.700
 goes beyond just a matter of having a data stream.

20:49.700 --> 20:51.800
 It's now the preservation of the information

20:51.800 --> 20:53.100
 in the data stream.

20:53.100 --> 20:56.200
 And so unless you can build something that's like

20:56.200 --> 20:59.800
 a super, super, super version of the way the internet works

20:59.800 --> 21:02.100
 because most people aren't aware that the internet itself

21:02.100 --> 21:04.700
 is actually a miracle, it's based on a technology

21:04.700 --> 21:06.300
 called message packaging.

21:06.300 --> 21:10.300
 So if you could exponentiate message packaging

21:10.300 --> 21:11.900
 in some way to preserve the information

21:11.900 --> 21:13.500
 that's in the data stream, then maybe

21:13.500 --> 21:14.700
 your dream becomes true.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.900
 You mentioned with artificial intelligence,

21:18.900 --> 21:21.900
 sort of us human beings not having

21:21.900 --> 21:24.400
 a monopoly on consciousness.

21:24.400 --> 21:29.400
 Does the idea of artificial intelligence systems,

21:29.400 --> 21:33.300
 computational systems, being able to basically

21:33.300 --> 21:37.800
 replacing us humans scare you, excite you?

21:37.800 --> 21:38.800
 What do you think about that?

21:38.800 --> 21:40.100
 So I'm gonna tell you about a conversation

21:40.100 --> 21:41.900
 I once had with Eric Schmidt.

21:41.900 --> 21:43.300
 I was sitting at a meeting with him

21:43.300 --> 21:46.700
 and he was a few feet away and he turned to me

21:46.700 --> 21:49.300
 and he said something like, you know, Jim,

21:49.300 --> 21:51.600
 in maybe a decade or so, we're gonna have computers

21:51.600 --> 21:53.200
 that do what you do.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.800
 And my response was not unless they can dream

21:55.800 --> 21:57.700
 because there's something about,

21:57.700 --> 22:01.200
 the way that we humans actually generate creativity.

22:01.200 --> 22:04.700
 It's somehow, I get this sense of my lived experience

22:04.700 --> 22:07.100
 in watching creative people that it's somehow

22:07.100 --> 22:09.700
 connected to the irrational parts of what goes on

22:09.700 --> 22:12.500
 in our head and dreaming is part of that irrational.

22:12.500 --> 22:15.200
 So unless you can build a piece of artificial intelligence

22:15.200 --> 22:17.200
 that dreams, I have a strong suspicion

22:17.200 --> 22:21.100
 that you will not get something that will fully be conscious

22:21.100 --> 22:24.300
 by a definition that I would accept, for example.

22:24.300 --> 22:25.900
 So you mentioned dreaming.

22:25.900 --> 22:30.900
 You've played around with some out there fascinating ideas.

22:31.700 --> 22:35.300
 How do you think, and we'll start diving into

22:35.300 --> 22:38.200
 the world of the very small ideas of super symmetry

22:38.200 --> 22:41.700
 and all that in terms of visualization,

22:41.700 --> 22:43.900
 in terms of how do you think about it?

22:43.900 --> 22:44.900
 How do you dream of it?

22:44.900 --> 22:46.700
 How do you come up with ideas

22:46.700 --> 22:49.300
 in that fascinating, mysterious space?

22:49.300 --> 22:52.900
 So in my workspace, which is basically

22:52.900 --> 22:57.900
 where I am charged with coming up on a mathematical palette

22:59.900 --> 23:02.100
 with new ideas that will help me understand

23:02.100 --> 23:04.500
 the structure of nature and hopefully help all of us

23:04.500 --> 23:06.300
 understand the structure of nature.

23:06.300 --> 23:08.100
 I've observed several different ways

23:08.100 --> 23:10.500
 in which my creativity expresses itself.

23:10.500 --> 23:12.900
 There's one mode which looks pretty normal,

23:12.900 --> 23:16.700
 which I sort of think of as the Chinese water torture method.

23:16.700 --> 23:19.500
 Drop, drop, drop, you get more and more information

23:19.500 --> 23:23.100
 and suddenly it all congeals and you get a clear picture.

23:23.100 --> 23:25.100
 And so that's kind of a standard way of working.

23:25.100 --> 23:27.700
 And I think that's how most people think about

23:28.700 --> 23:30.700
 the way technical people solve problems.

23:30.700 --> 23:34.700
 That is kind of you accumulate this body of information

23:34.700 --> 23:37.300
 and at a certain point you synthesize it

23:37.300 --> 23:39.100
 and then boom, there's something new.

23:39.100 --> 23:41.900
 But I've also observed in myself and other scientists

23:41.900 --> 23:44.500
 that there are other ways that we are creative.

23:44.500 --> 23:48.900
 And these other ways to me are actually far more powerful.

23:48.900 --> 23:50.500
 I first personally experienced this

23:50.500 --> 23:53.500
 when I was a freshman at MIT over in Baker House

23:53.500 --> 23:55.500
 right across the campus.

23:55.500 --> 24:00.500
 And I was in a calculus course, 1801 is called at MIT.

24:00.500 --> 24:03.700
 And calculus comes in two different flavors.

24:03.700 --> 24:05.900
 One of them is called differential calculus.

24:05.900 --> 24:07.500
 The other is called integral calculus.

24:07.500 --> 24:09.700
 Differential calculus is the calculus

24:09.700 --> 24:13.300
 that Newton invented to describe motion.

24:13.300 --> 24:15.300
 It turns out integral calculus was probably invented

24:15.300 --> 24:18.100
 about 1700 years earlier by Archimedes.

24:18.100 --> 24:20.900
 But we didn't know that when I was a freshman.

24:20.900 --> 24:24.100
 But so that's what you study as a student.

24:24.100 --> 24:26.900
 And the differential calculus part of the course was,

24:26.900 --> 24:30.300
 to me, I wouldn't, how do I say this?

24:30.300 --> 24:32.900
 It was something that by the drip, drip, drip method

24:32.900 --> 24:34.500
 you could sort of figure it out.

24:35.300 --> 24:37.500
 Now, the integral part of calculus,

24:37.500 --> 24:38.900
 I could memorize the formula.

24:38.900 --> 24:42.100
 That was not the formulae, that was not the problem.

24:42.100 --> 24:44.700
 The problem was why, in my own mind,

24:44.700 --> 24:47.300
 why do these formulae work?

24:47.300 --> 24:52.300
 And because of that, when I was in the part

24:52.300 --> 24:53.900
 of the calculus course where we had to do

24:53.900 --> 24:56.500
 multiple substitutions to solve integrals,

24:56.500 --> 24:57.900
 I had a lot of difficulty.

24:59.300 --> 25:01.300
 I was emotionally involved in my education

25:01.300 --> 25:05.500
 because this is where I think the passion of motion comes to.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.700
 And it caused an emotional crisis

25:07.700 --> 25:09.100
 that I was having these difficulties

25:09.100 --> 25:10.700
 understanding the integral part of calculus.

25:10.700 --> 25:11.700
 The why.

25:11.700 --> 25:12.900
 The why, that's right, the why of it.

25:12.900 --> 25:15.100
 Not the rote memorization of fact,

25:15.100 --> 25:16.300
 but the why of it.

25:16.300 --> 25:18.300
 Why does this work?

25:18.300 --> 25:21.700
 And so one night I was over in my dormitory room

25:21.700 --> 25:23.100
 in Baker House.

25:23.100 --> 25:25.900
 I was trying to do a calculus problem set.

25:25.900 --> 25:27.500
 I was getting nowhere.

25:28.500 --> 25:30.900
 I got a terrific headache.

25:30.900 --> 25:33.700
 I went to sleep and had this very strange dream.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.700
 And when I woke, awakened,

25:36.700 --> 25:38.500
 I could do three and four substitutions

25:38.500 --> 25:41.300
 and integrals with relative ease.

25:41.300 --> 25:44.300
 Now, this to me was an astounding experience

25:44.300 --> 25:48.700
 because I had never before in my life understood

25:48.700 --> 25:51.100
 that one subconscious is actually capable

25:51.100 --> 25:53.100
 of being harnessed to do mathematics.

25:54.100 --> 25:55.100
 I experienced it, this.

25:55.100 --> 25:56.700
 And I've experienced this more than once.

25:56.700 --> 25:59.900
 So this was just the first time why I remember it so.

25:59.900 --> 26:02.100
 So that's why when it comes to like

26:02.100 --> 26:04.300
 really wickedly tough problems,

26:04.300 --> 26:06.100
 I think that the kind of creativity

26:06.100 --> 26:08.700
 that you need to solve them

26:08.700 --> 26:10.900
 is probably this second variety

26:10.900 --> 26:14.300
 which comes somehow from dreaming.

26:15.900 --> 26:18.700
 Do you think, again, I told you I'm Russian.

26:18.700 --> 26:20.500
 So we romanticize suffering.

26:20.500 --> 26:22.300
 But do you think part of that equation

26:22.300 --> 26:25.900
 is the suffering leading up to that dreaming?

26:25.900 --> 26:28.500
 So the suffering is,

26:28.500 --> 26:31.900
 I am convinced that this kind of creative,

26:31.900 --> 26:34.700
 this second mode of creativity as I like to call it,

26:34.700 --> 26:37.700
 I'm convinced that this second mode of creativity

26:37.700 --> 26:42.700
 is in fact that suffering is a kind of crucible

26:43.300 --> 26:44.700
 that triggers it.

26:44.700 --> 26:47.700
 Because the mind I think is struggling to get out of this.

26:47.700 --> 26:51.300
 And the only way to actually solve the problem.

26:51.300 --> 26:54.100
 And even though you're not consciously solving problems,

26:54.100 --> 26:55.500
 something is going on.

26:55.500 --> 26:57.300
 And I've talked about to a few other people

26:57.300 --> 27:00.100
 and I've heard other similar stories.

27:00.100 --> 27:03.300
 And so I guess what I think about it is

27:03.300 --> 27:04.900
 it's a little bit by like the way

27:04.900 --> 27:07.900
 that thermonuclear weapons work.

27:07.900 --> 27:09.300
 I don't know if you know how they work.

27:09.300 --> 27:11.700
 But a thermonuclear weapon is actually two bombs.

27:11.700 --> 27:14.300
 It's an atomic bomb which sort of does a compression.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.100
 And then you have a fusion bomb that goes off.

27:16.100 --> 27:18.900
 And somehow that emotional pressure

27:18.900 --> 27:22.100
 I think acts like the first stage of a thermonuclear weapon.

27:22.100 --> 27:24.100
 That's when we get really big thoughts.

27:25.100 --> 27:27.500
 The analogy between thermonuclear weapons

27:27.500 --> 27:30.900
 and the subconscious, the connection there is,

27:30.900 --> 27:34.700
 at least visually, is kind of interesting.

27:34.700 --> 27:39.700
 There may be, Freud would have a few things to say.

27:39.700 --> 27:41.300
 Well, part of it is probably based

27:41.300 --> 27:43.100
 on my own trajectory through life.

27:43.100 --> 27:46.700
 My father was in the US Army for 27 years.

27:46.700 --> 27:50.300
 And so I started my life out on a military basis.

27:50.300 --> 27:53.700
 And so a lot of probably the things that wander around

27:53.700 --> 27:56.300
 in my subconscious are connected to that experience.

27:56.300 --> 27:58.700
 I apologize for all the tangents, but.

27:58.700 --> 27:59.900
 Well, you're doing it.

27:59.900 --> 28:01.100
 You're doing it.

28:01.100 --> 28:07.100
 But you're encouraging by answering the stupid questions.

28:07.100 --> 28:08.100
 No, they're not stupid.

28:08.100 --> 28:12.100
 You know, your father was in the Army.

28:14.100 --> 28:20.100
 What do you think about, Neil deGrasse Tyson recently wrote

28:20.100 --> 28:25.500
 a book on interlinking the progress of science

28:25.500 --> 28:31.700
 to sort of the aspirations of our military endeavors

28:31.700 --> 28:33.900
 and DARPA funding and so on.

28:33.900 --> 28:35.900
 What do you think about war in general?

28:35.900 --> 28:37.900
 Do you think we'll always have war?

28:37.900 --> 28:42.100
 Do you think we'll always have conflict in the world?

28:42.100 --> 28:43.700
 I'm not sure that we're going to be able

28:43.700 --> 28:47.500
 to afford to have war always, because if.

28:47.500 --> 28:49.100
 Strictly financially speaking?

28:49.100 --> 28:53.300
 No, not in terms of finance, but in terms of consequences.

28:53.300 --> 28:56.900
 So if you look at technology today,

28:56.900 --> 29:00.500
 you can have non state actors acquire technology,

29:00.500 --> 29:05.100
 for example, bioterrorism, whose impact is roughly speaking

29:05.100 --> 29:07.700
 equivalent to what it used to take nations

29:07.700 --> 29:10.700
 to impart on a population.

29:10.700 --> 29:13.300
 I think the cost of war is ultimately,

29:13.300 --> 29:14.500
 it's going to be a little, I think

29:14.500 --> 29:16.700
 it's going to work a little bit like the Cold War.

29:16.700 --> 29:21.700
 You know, we survived 50, 60 years as a species

29:21.700 --> 29:25.500
 with these weapons that are so terrible that they could have

29:25.500 --> 29:29.000
 actually ended our form of life on this planet, but it didn't.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.100
 Why didn't it?

29:30.100 --> 29:32.100
 Well, it's a very bizarre and interesting thing,

29:32.100 --> 29:34.500
 but it was called mutually assured destruction.

29:34.500 --> 29:37.500
 And so the cost was so great that people eventually

29:37.500 --> 29:39.100
 figured out that you can't really

29:39.100 --> 29:41.100
 use these things, which is kind of interesting,

29:41.100 --> 29:43.300
 because if you read the history about the development

29:43.300 --> 29:45.300
 of nuclear weapons, physicists actually

29:45.300 --> 29:46.900
 realized this pretty quickly.

29:46.900 --> 29:49.000
 I think it was maybe Schrodinger who

29:49.000 --> 29:51.300
 said that these things are not really weapons.

29:51.300 --> 29:52.900
 They're political implements.

29:52.900 --> 29:55.900
 They're not weapons, because the cost is so high.

29:55.900 --> 30:00.200
 And if you take that example and spread it out

30:00.200 --> 30:01.900
 to the kind of technological development

30:01.900 --> 30:04.200
 we're seeing now outside of nuclear physics,

30:04.200 --> 30:06.900
 but I picked the example of biology,

30:06.900 --> 30:10.500
 I could well imagine that there would be material science

30:10.500 --> 30:14.500
 sorts of equivalents across a broad front of technology.

30:14.500 --> 30:17.300
 You take that experience from nuclear weapons,

30:17.300 --> 30:20.800
 and the picture that I see is that it would be possible

30:20.800 --> 30:24.300
 to develop technologies that are so terrible that you couldn't

30:24.300 --> 30:27.600
 use them, because the costs are too high.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.100
 And that might cure us.

30:29.100 --> 30:33.100
 And many people have argued that actually it prevented,

30:33.100 --> 30:36.700
 nuclear weapons have prevented more military conflict than.

30:36.700 --> 30:41.100
 It certainly froze the conflict domain.

30:41.100 --> 30:44.000
 It's interesting that nowadays it

30:44.000 --> 30:46.900
 was with the removal of the threat of mutually assured

30:46.900 --> 30:52.300
 destruction that other forces took over in our geopolitics.

30:52.300 --> 30:57.700
 Do you have worries of existential threats

30:57.700 --> 31:00.200
 of nuclear weapons or other technologies

31:00.200 --> 31:01.700
 like artificial intelligence?

31:01.700 --> 31:05.100
 Do you think we humans will tend to figure out

31:05.100 --> 31:06.900
 how to not blow ourselves up?

31:06.900 --> 31:10.000
 I don't know, quite frankly.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.700
 This is something I've thought about.

31:11.700 --> 31:16.900
 And I'm not, I mean, so I'm a spectator in the sense

31:16.900 --> 31:21.700
 that as a scientist, I collect and collate data.

31:21.700 --> 31:23.300
 So I've been doing that all my life

31:23.300 --> 31:25.300
 and looking at my species.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.500
 And it's not clear to me that we are

31:27.500 --> 31:31.500
 going to avoid a catastrophic, self induced ending.

31:34.500 --> 31:37.300
 Are you optimistic?

31:37.300 --> 31:40.700
 Not as a scientist, but as a single element speaker?

31:40.700 --> 31:45.400
 I would say I wouldn't bet against us.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.100
 Beautifully put.

31:47.100 --> 31:50.700
 Let's dive into the world of the very small,

31:50.700 --> 31:52.900
 if we could for a bit.

31:52.900 --> 31:56.900
 What are the basic particles, either experimentally observed

31:56.900 --> 31:59.300
 or hypothesized by physicists?

31:59.300 --> 32:02.500
 So as we physicists look at the universe,

32:02.500 --> 32:05.300
 you can, first of all, there are two big buckets of particles.

32:05.300 --> 32:07.200
 That is the smallest objects that we

32:07.200 --> 32:11.300
 are able to currently mathematically conceive

32:11.300 --> 32:15.700
 and then experimentally verify that these ideas have

32:15.700 --> 32:17.700
 a sense of accuracy to them.

32:17.700 --> 32:20.900
 So one of those buckets we call matter.

32:20.900 --> 32:23.300
 These are things like electrons, things

32:23.300 --> 32:25.900
 that are like quarks, which are particles that

32:25.900 --> 32:27.900
 exist inside of protons.

32:27.900 --> 32:30.700
 And there's a whole family of these things.

32:30.700 --> 32:34.300
 There are, in fact, 18 quarks and apparently six

32:34.300 --> 32:37.500
 electron like objects that we call leptons.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.100
 So that's one bucket.

32:39.100 --> 32:41.700
 The other bucket that we see both in our mathematics

32:41.700 --> 32:43.700
 as well as in our experimental equipment

32:43.700 --> 32:47.900
 are a set of particles that you can call force carriers.

32:47.900 --> 32:50.700
 The most familiar force carrier is the photon, the particle

32:50.700 --> 32:52.200
 of light that allows you to see me.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.300
 In fact, it's the same object that

32:54.300 --> 32:58.300
 carries electric repulsion between like charges.

32:58.300 --> 33:00.900
 From science fiction, we have the object

33:00.900 --> 33:03.600
 called the graviton, which is talked about a lot in science

33:03.600 --> 33:05.300
 fiction and Star Trek.

33:05.300 --> 33:07.500
 But the graviton is also a mathematical object

33:07.500 --> 33:09.400
 that we physicists have known about essentially

33:09.400 --> 33:13.400
 since Einstein wrote his theory of general relativity.

33:13.400 --> 33:17.700
 There are four forces in nature, the fundamental forces.

33:17.700 --> 33:19.600
 There is the gravitational force.

33:19.600 --> 33:21.400
 Its carrier is the graviton.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.100
 There are three other forces in nature,

33:23.100 --> 33:25.800
 the electromagnetic force, the strong nuclear force,

33:25.800 --> 33:27.000
 and the weak nuclear force.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.200
 And each one of these forces has one or more carriers.

33:30.200 --> 33:33.200
 The photon is the carrier of the electromagnetic force.

33:33.200 --> 33:35.900
 The strong nuclear force actually has eight carriers.

33:35.900 --> 33:37.300
 They're called gluons.

33:37.300 --> 33:39.500
 And then the weak nuclear force has three carriers.

33:39.500 --> 33:44.000
 They're called the W plus, W minus, and Z bosons.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.500
 So those are the things that both in mathematics

33:46.500 --> 33:49.900
 and in experiments, by the way, the most precise experiments

33:49.900 --> 33:53.100
 we're ever as a species able to conduct

33:53.100 --> 33:55.500
 is about measuring the accuracy of these ideas.

33:55.500 --> 33:57.600
 And we know that at least to one part in a billion,

33:57.600 --> 33:59.600
 these ideas are right.

33:59.600 --> 34:05.400
 So first of all, you've made it sound both elegant and simple.

34:05.400 --> 34:11.300
 But is it crazy to you that there is force carriers?

34:11.300 --> 34:14.500
 Like, is that supposed to be a trivial idea to think about?

34:14.500 --> 34:17.300
 If we think about photons, gluons,

34:17.300 --> 34:21.300
 that there's four fundamental forces of physics,

34:21.300 --> 34:24.200
 and then those forces are expressed.

34:24.200 --> 34:26.600
 There's carriers of those forces.

34:26.600 --> 34:29.600
 Like, is that a kind of trivial thing?

34:29.600 --> 34:31.000
 It's not a trivial thing at all.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.100
 In fact, it was a puzzle for Sir Isaac Newton,

34:33.100 --> 34:37.200
 because he's the first person to give us basically physics.

34:37.200 --> 34:39.800
 Before Isaac Newton, physics didn't exist.

34:39.800 --> 34:41.700
 What did exist was called natural philosophy,

34:41.700 --> 34:45.100
 so discussions about using the methods of classical philosophy

34:45.100 --> 34:48.400
 to understand nature, natural philosophy.

34:48.400 --> 34:50.700
 So the Greeks, we call them scientists,

34:50.700 --> 34:52.800
 but they were natural philosophers.

34:52.800 --> 34:56.600
 Physics doesn't get born until Newton writes the Principia.

34:56.600 --> 35:00.500
 One of the things that puzzled him was how gravity works,

35:00.500 --> 35:04.800
 because if you read very carefully what he writes,

35:04.800 --> 35:07.300
 he basically says, and I'm paraphrasing badly,

35:07.300 --> 35:10.000
 but he basically says that someone who thinks deeply

35:10.000 --> 35:13.200
 about this subject would find it inconceivable

35:13.200 --> 35:17.000
 that an object in one place or location

35:17.000 --> 35:19.500
 can magically reach out and affect another object

35:19.500 --> 35:21.600
 with nothing intervening.

35:21.600 --> 35:23.100
 And so it puzzled him.

35:23.100 --> 35:25.700
 There's a puzzle of you, action at a distance.

35:25.700 --> 35:27.000
 I mean, not as a physicist.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.900
 It would, it would, except that I am a physicist,

35:29.900 --> 35:32.400
 and we have long ago resolved this issue,

35:32.400 --> 35:33.500
 and the resolution came about

35:33.500 --> 35:36.800
 through a second great physicist.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.400
 Most people have heard of Newton.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.100
 Most people have heard of Einstein.

35:40.100 --> 35:41.100
 But between the two of them,

35:41.100 --> 35:43.600
 there was another extraordinarily great physicist,

35:43.600 --> 35:45.900
 a man named James Clark Maxwell.

35:45.900 --> 35:49.500
 And Maxwell, between these two other giants,

35:49.500 --> 35:52.900
 taught us about electric and magnetic forces,

35:52.900 --> 35:55.900
 and it's from his equations that one can figure out

35:55.900 --> 35:58.200
 that there's a carrier called the photon.

35:58.200 --> 36:02.800
 So this was resolved for physicists around 1860 or so.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.400
 So what are bosons and fermions and hadrons,

36:08.400 --> 36:09.700
 elementary and composites?

36:09.700 --> 36:12.900
 Sure, so earlier I said.

36:12.900 --> 36:13.740
 Two buckets.

36:13.740 --> 36:14.600
 You have got two buckets

36:14.600 --> 36:15.800
 if you wanna try to build the universe.

36:15.800 --> 36:18.700
 You gotta start off with things on these two buckets.

36:18.700 --> 36:21.300
 So you gotta have things, that's a matter,

36:21.300 --> 36:23.800
 and then you have to have other objects that act on them

36:23.800 --> 36:28.400
 to cause those things to cohere to fixed finite patterns,

36:28.400 --> 36:30.000
 because you need those fixed finite patterns

36:30.000 --> 36:31.100
 as building blocks.

36:31.100 --> 36:34.000
 So that's the way our universe looks to people like me.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.100
 Now, the building blocks do different things.

36:37.100 --> 36:39.800
 So let's go back to these two buckets again.

36:39.800 --> 36:42.800
 Let me start with a bucket containing the particle of light.

36:42.800 --> 36:46.400
 Let me imagine I'm in a dusty room with two flashlights,

36:46.400 --> 36:49.300
 and I have one flashlight, which I direct directly

36:49.300 --> 36:52.800
 in front of me, and then I have you stand over to say my left

36:52.800 --> 36:54.800
 and then we both take our flashlights and turn them on

36:54.800 --> 36:56.800
 and make sure the beams go right through each other.

36:56.800 --> 36:57.900
 And the beams do just that.

36:57.900 --> 36:58.800
 They go right through each other.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.300
 They don't bounce off of each other.

37:00.300 --> 37:01.500
 The reason the room has to be dusty

37:01.500 --> 37:03.500
 is because we wanna see the light.

37:03.500 --> 37:04.500
 The room dust wasn't there.

37:04.500 --> 37:05.500
 We wouldn't actually see the light

37:05.500 --> 37:07.000
 until it got to the other wall, right?

37:07.000 --> 37:09.900
 So you see the beam because it's the dust in the air.

37:09.900 --> 37:12.600
 But the two beams actually pass right through each other.

37:12.600 --> 37:13.900
 They literally pass right through.

37:13.900 --> 37:15.900
 They don't affect each other at all.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.800
 One acts like the other's not there.

37:20.200 --> 37:23.000
 The particle of light is the simplest example

37:23.000 --> 37:24.600
 that shows that behavior.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.200
 That's a boson.

37:26.200 --> 37:30.100
 Now let's imagine that we're in the same dusty room

37:30.100 --> 37:31.900
 and this time you have a bucket of balls

37:31.900 --> 37:33.100
 and I have a bucket of balls.

37:33.100 --> 37:36.200
 And we try to throw them so that we get something

37:36.200 --> 37:38.300
 like a beam, throwing them fast, right?

37:39.200 --> 37:41.500
 If they collide, they don't just pass through each other.

37:41.500 --> 37:43.400
 They bounce off of each other.

37:43.400 --> 37:45.900
 Now that's mostly because they have electric charge

37:45.900 --> 37:48.500
 and electric charges, light charges repel.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.300
 But mathematically, I know how to turn off

37:50.300 --> 37:51.500
 the electric charge.

37:51.500 --> 37:53.800
 And if you do that, you'll find these still repel.

37:53.800 --> 37:57.100
 And it's because they are these things we call fermions.

37:57.100 --> 37:59.000
 So this is how you distinguish the things

37:59.000 --> 38:00.200
 that are in the two buckets.

38:00.200 --> 38:02.200
 They are either bosons or fermions.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.900
 Which of them, and maybe you can mention

38:06.900 --> 38:09.900
 the most popular of the bosons.

38:09.900 --> 38:12.000
 The most recently discovered.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.200
 It's like when I was in high school

38:15.200 --> 38:18.300
 and there was a really popular majorette.

38:18.300 --> 38:21.500
 Her name is the Higgs particle these days.

38:21.500 --> 38:26.500
 Can you describe which of the bosons

38:26.700 --> 38:28.500
 and the fermions have been discovered,

38:28.500 --> 38:31.300
 hypothesized, which have been experimentally validated,

38:31.300 --> 38:32.200
 what's still out there?

38:32.200 --> 38:37.100
 Right, so the two buckets that I've actually described

38:37.100 --> 38:40.200
 to you have all been first hypothesized

38:40.200 --> 38:43.100
 and then verified by observation.

38:43.100 --> 38:45.200
 With the Higgs boson being the most recent

38:45.200 --> 38:47.200
 one of these things.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.800
 We haven't actually verified the graviton

38:49.800 --> 38:51.200
 interestingly enough.

38:51.200 --> 38:54.100
 Mathematically, we have an expectation

38:54.100 --> 38:55.400
 that gravitons exist.

38:55.400 --> 38:56.900
 But we've not performed an experiment

38:56.900 --> 38:59.900
 to show that this is an accurate idea that nature uses.

38:59.900 --> 39:02.200
 So something has to be a carrier.

39:02.200 --> 39:04.500
 For the force of gravity, exactly.

39:04.500 --> 39:08.000
 Can it be something way more mysterious than we,

39:08.000 --> 39:11.500
 so when you say the graviton, is it,

39:11.500 --> 39:15.000
 would it be like the other particles, force carriers,

39:15.000 --> 39:16.300
 or can it be something much more mysterious?

39:16.300 --> 39:18.700
 In some ways, yes, but in other ways, no.

39:18.700 --> 39:21.900
 It turns out that the graviton is also,

39:21.900 --> 39:24.200
 if you look at Einstein's theory,

39:24.200 --> 39:26.600
 he taught us about this thing he calls space time,

39:26.600 --> 39:29.300
 which is, if you try to imagine it,

39:29.300 --> 39:32.400
 you can sort of think of it as kind of a rubber surface.

39:32.400 --> 39:34.900
 That's one popular depiction of space time.

39:34.900 --> 39:36.200
 It's not an accurate depiction

39:36.200 --> 39:38.600
 because the only accuracy is actually in the calculus

39:38.600 --> 39:41.100
 that he uses, but that's close enough.

39:41.100 --> 39:43.700
 So if you have a sheet of rubber, you can wave it.

39:43.700 --> 39:46.000
 You can actually form a wave on it.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.800
 Space time is enough like that

39:47.800 --> 39:51.000
 so that when space time oscillates, you create these waves.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.100
 These waves carry energy.

39:53.100 --> 39:55.000
 We expect them to carry energy in quanta.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.100
 That's what a graviton is.

39:56.100 --> 39:57.700
 It's a wave in space time.

39:57.700 --> 40:00.700
 And so the fact that we have seen the waves

40:00.700 --> 40:03.700
 with LIGO over the course of the last three years,

40:03.700 --> 40:07.200
 and we've recently used gravitational wave observatories

40:07.200 --> 40:09.800
 to watch colliding black holes and neutron stars

40:09.800 --> 40:12.500
 and all sorts of really cool stuff out there.

40:12.500 --> 40:14.600
 So we know the waves exist,

40:14.600 --> 40:16.700
 but in order to know that gravitons exist,

40:16.700 --> 40:18.800
 you have to prove that these waves carry energy

40:18.800 --> 40:20.400
 in energy packets.

40:20.400 --> 40:23.400
 And that's what we don't have the technology to do yet.

40:25.100 --> 40:28.300
 And perhaps briefly jumping to a philosophical question,

40:28.300 --> 40:30.600
 does it make sense to you that gravity

40:30.600 --> 40:32.900
 is so much weaker than the other forces?

40:32.900 --> 40:34.300
 No.

40:34.300 --> 40:39.300
 You see, now you've touched on a very deep mystery

40:40.500 --> 40:41.700
 about physics.

40:42.600 --> 40:44.300
 There are a lot of such questions in physics

40:44.300 --> 40:47.200
 about why things are as they are.

40:47.200 --> 40:50.900
 And as someone who believes that there are some things

40:50.900 --> 40:53.400
 that certainly are coincidences,

40:53.400 --> 40:54.800
 like you could ask the same question about,

40:54.800 --> 40:57.100
 well, why are the planets at the orbits

40:57.100 --> 40:58.900
 that they are around the sun?

40:58.900 --> 41:00.300
 The answer turns out there is no good reason.

41:00.300 --> 41:01.400
 It's just an accident.

41:01.400 --> 41:03.500
 So there are things in nature that have that character.

41:03.500 --> 41:08.500
 And perhaps the strength of the various forces is like that.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.900
 On the other hand, we don't know that that's the case.

41:10.900 --> 41:12.500
 And there may be some deep reasons

41:12.500 --> 41:15.900
 about why the forces are ordered as they are,

41:15.900 --> 41:17.600
 where the weakest force is gravity,

41:17.600 --> 41:19.700
 the next weakest force is the weak interaction,

41:19.700 --> 41:22.000
 the weak nuclear force, then there's electromagnetism,

41:22.000 --> 41:23.100
 there's a strong force.

41:23.100 --> 41:24.700
 We don't really have a good understanding

41:24.700 --> 41:27.000
 of why this is the ordering of the forces.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.900
 So some of the fascinating work you've done

41:30.900 --> 41:35.900
 is in the space of supersymmetry, symmetry in general.

41:36.300 --> 41:39.500
 Can you describe, first of all, what is supersymmetry?

41:39.500 --> 41:41.400
 Yes, so you remember the two buckets

41:41.400 --> 41:43.500
 I told you about perhaps earlier?

41:43.500 --> 41:46.100
 So there are two buckets in our universe.

41:46.100 --> 41:51.100
 So now I want you to think about drawing a pie

41:51.800 --> 41:53.000
 that has four quadrants.

41:53.000 --> 41:56.200
 So I want you to cut the piece of pie in fourths.

41:56.200 --> 41:58.300
 So in one quadrant, I'm gonna put all the buckets

41:58.300 --> 42:01.400
 that we talked about that are like the electron and quarks.

42:01.400 --> 42:02.400
 In a different quadrant,

42:02.400 --> 42:04.500
 I'm going to put all the force carriers.

42:04.500 --> 42:06.600
 The other two quadrants are empty.

42:06.600 --> 42:08.500
 Now, I showed you a picture of that.

42:08.500 --> 42:10.100
 You'd see a circle.

42:10.100 --> 42:12.600
 There would be a bunch of stuff in one upper quadrant

42:12.600 --> 42:13.900
 and stuff in others.

42:13.900 --> 42:15.900
 And then I would ask you a question.

42:15.900 --> 42:17.600
 Does that look symmetrical to you?

42:19.100 --> 42:20.700
 No. No.

42:20.700 --> 42:22.100
 And that's exactly right

42:22.100 --> 42:26.700
 because we humans actually have a very deeply programmed

42:26.700 --> 42:28.000
 sense of symmetry.

42:28.000 --> 42:32.900
 It's something that is part of that mystery of the universe.

42:32.900 --> 42:34.300
 So how would you make it symmetrical?

42:34.300 --> 42:35.800
 Or one way you could is by saying

42:35.800 --> 42:38.900
 those two empty quadrants had things in them also.

42:38.900 --> 42:42.500
 And if you do that, that's supersymmetry.

42:42.500 --> 42:43.500
 So that's what I understood

42:43.500 --> 42:47.900
 when I was a graduate student here at MIT in 1975

42:47.900 --> 42:52.300
 when the mathematics of this was first being born.

42:52.300 --> 42:55.000
 Supersymmetry was actually born in the Ukraine

42:55.000 --> 42:56.700
 in the late 60s, but we had this thing

42:56.700 --> 42:57.600
 called the Iron Curtain.

42:57.600 --> 43:00.500
 So we Westerners didn't know about it.

43:00.500 --> 43:02.900
 But by the early 70s, independently,

43:02.900 --> 43:04.300
 there were scientists in the West

43:04.300 --> 43:07.500
 who had rediscovered supersymmetry.

43:07.500 --> 43:10.400
 Bruno Zemeno and Julius Wess were their names.

43:10.400 --> 43:14.100
 So this was around 71 or 72 when this happened.

43:14.100 --> 43:16.200
 I started graduate school in 73.

43:16.200 --> 43:19.200
 So around 74, 75, I was trying to figure out

43:19.200 --> 43:21.500
 how to write a thesis so that I could become a physicist

43:21.500 --> 43:22.600
 the rest of my life.

43:23.600 --> 43:27.700
 I did a, I had a great advisor, Professor James Young

43:27.700 --> 43:31.100
 who had taught me a number of things about electrons

43:31.100 --> 43:33.900
 and weak forces and those sorts of things.

43:33.900 --> 43:38.900
 But I decided that if I was going to have a really

43:40.900 --> 43:45.500
 an opportunity to maximize my chances of being successful,

43:45.500 --> 43:46.900
 I should strike it out in a direction

43:46.900 --> 43:48.800
 that other people were not studying.

43:48.800 --> 43:52.200
 And so as a consequence, I surveyed ideas

43:52.200 --> 43:54.300
 that were going, that were being developed.

43:54.300 --> 43:57.100
 And I came across the idea of supersymmetry.

43:57.100 --> 44:00.700
 And it was so, the mathematics was so remarkable

44:00.700 --> 44:03.100
 that I just, it bowled me over.

44:03.100 --> 44:05.500
 I actually have two undergraduate degrees.

44:05.500 --> 44:07.600
 My first undergraduate degree is actually mathematics.

44:07.600 --> 44:09.400
 And my second is physics,

44:09.400 --> 44:12.000
 even though I always wanted to be a physicist.

44:12.000 --> 44:17.000
 Plan A, which involved getting good grades was mathematics.

44:17.500 --> 44:20.500
 I was a mathematics major thinking about graduate school,

44:20.500 --> 44:22.000
 but my heart was in physics.

44:22.800 --> 44:26.200
 If we could take a small digression,

44:26.200 --> 44:29.100
 what's to you the most beautiful idea in mathematics

44:29.100 --> 44:31.600
 that you've encountered in this interplay

44:31.600 --> 44:33.400
 between math and physics?

44:33.400 --> 44:35.500
 It's the idea of symmetry.

44:35.500 --> 44:39.900
 The fact that our innate sense of symmetry

44:39.900 --> 44:44.500
 winds up aligning with just incredible mathematics,

44:44.500 --> 44:47.400
 to me is the most beautiful thing.

44:47.400 --> 44:50.100
 It's very strange, but true

44:50.100 --> 44:53.100
 that if symmetries were perfect, we would not exist.

44:53.100 --> 44:55.200
 And so even though we have these very powerful ideas

44:55.200 --> 44:57.700
 about balance in the universe in some sense,

44:57.700 --> 44:59.200
 it's only when you break those balances

44:59.200 --> 45:01.000
 that you get creatures like humans

45:01.000 --> 45:03.600
 and objects like planets and stars.

45:03.600 --> 45:07.100
 So although they are a scaffold for reality,

45:07.100 --> 45:09.500
 they cannot be the entirety of reality.

45:09.500 --> 45:14.500
 So I'm kind of naturally attracted

45:15.500 --> 45:18.900
 to parts of science and technology

45:18.900 --> 45:21.400
 where symmetry plays a dominant role.

45:21.400 --> 45:23.500
 And not just, I guess, symmetry as you said,

45:23.500 --> 45:26.800
 but the magic happens when you break the symmetry.

45:26.800 --> 45:29.600
 The magic happens when you break the symmetry.

45:29.600 --> 45:31.300
 Okay, so diving right back in,

45:31.300 --> 45:33.100
 you mentioned four quadrants.

45:33.100 --> 45:34.100
 Yes.

45:34.100 --> 45:37.100
 Two are filled with stuff we can, two buckets.

45:37.100 --> 45:39.500
 And then there's crazy mathematical thing,

45:39.500 --> 45:41.600
 ideas fulfilling the other two.

45:41.600 --> 45:43.300
 What are those things?

45:43.300 --> 45:46.200
 So earlier, the way I described these two buckets

45:46.200 --> 45:48.900
 is I gave you a story that started out

45:48.900 --> 45:52.700
 by putting us in a dusty room with two flashlights.

45:52.700 --> 45:55.300
 And I said, turn on your flashlight, I'll turn on mine,

45:55.300 --> 45:56.700
 the beams will go through each other.

45:56.700 --> 46:00.900
 And the beams are composed of force carriers called photons.

46:00.900 --> 46:03.200
 They carry the electromagnetic force

46:03.200 --> 46:04.300
 and they pass right through each other.

46:04.300 --> 46:07.600
 So imagine looking at the mathematics of such an object,

46:07.600 --> 46:10.400
 which you don't have to imagine people like me do that.

46:11.400 --> 46:12.800
 So you take that mathematics

46:12.800 --> 46:15.200
 and then you ask yourself a question.

46:15.200 --> 46:16.700
 You see, mathematics is a palette.

46:16.700 --> 46:20.700
 It's just like a musical composer

46:20.700 --> 46:24.400
 is able to construct variations on a theme.

46:24.400 --> 46:26.800
 Well, a piece of mathematics in the hand of a physicist

46:26.800 --> 46:29.000
 is something that we can construct variations on.

46:29.000 --> 46:33.300
 So even though the mathematics that Maxwell gave us

46:33.300 --> 46:38.200
 about light, we know how to construct variations on that.

46:38.200 --> 46:41.100
 And one of the variations you can construct is to say,

46:41.100 --> 46:45.400
 suppose you have a force carrier for electromagnetism

46:45.400 --> 46:47.200
 that behaves like an electron

46:47.200 --> 46:49.500
 in that it would bounce off of another one.

46:49.500 --> 46:53.200
 That's changing a mathematical term in an equation.

46:53.200 --> 46:56.600
 So if you did that, you would have a force carrier.

46:56.600 --> 46:58.200
 So you would say first it belongs

46:58.200 --> 46:59.600
 in this force carrying bucket,

46:59.600 --> 47:01.700
 but it's got this property of bouncing off like electrons.

47:01.700 --> 47:03.400
 So you say, well, gee, wait, no,

47:03.400 --> 47:04.600
 that's not the right bucket.

47:04.600 --> 47:05.800
 So you're forced to actually put it

47:05.800 --> 47:07.800
 in one of these empty quadrants.

47:07.800 --> 47:12.100
 So those sorts of things, basically we give them...

47:12.100 --> 47:14.400
 So the photon mathematically

47:14.400 --> 47:15.900
 can be accompanied by a photino.

47:15.900 --> 47:18.200
 It's the thing that carries a force

47:18.200 --> 47:19.800
 but has the rule of bouncing off.

47:20.700 --> 47:23.300
 In a similar manner, you could start with an electron

47:24.200 --> 47:27.000
 and you say, okay, so write down the mathematical electron.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.200
 I know how to do that.

47:28.200 --> 47:30.200
 A physicist named Dirac first told us how to do that

47:30.200 --> 47:33.500
 back in the late 20s, early 30s.

47:33.500 --> 47:34.600
 So take that mathematics.

47:34.600 --> 47:37.700
 And then you say, let me look at that mathematics

47:37.700 --> 47:39.600
 and find out what in the mathematics

47:39.600 --> 47:42.300
 causes two electrons to bounce off of each other,

47:42.300 --> 47:44.500
 even if I turn off the electrical charge.

47:44.500 --> 47:45.600
 So I could do that.

47:45.600 --> 47:48.200
 And now let me change that mathematical term.

47:48.200 --> 47:50.700
 So now I have something that carries electrical charge,

47:50.700 --> 47:52.300
 but if you take two of them,

47:52.300 --> 47:53.700
 I'm sorry, if you turn their charges off,

47:53.700 --> 47:55.300
 they'll pass through each other.

47:55.300 --> 47:57.600
 So that puts things in the other quadrant.

47:57.600 --> 48:00.600
 And those things we tend to call,

48:00.600 --> 48:02.500
 we put the S in front of their name.

48:02.500 --> 48:04.800
 So in the lower quadrant here, we have electrons

48:04.800 --> 48:08.100
 and this now newly filled quadrant, we have selectors.

48:08.100 --> 48:12.300
 And the quadrant over here, we had quarks.

48:12.300 --> 48:13.700
 Over here, we have squarks.

48:13.700 --> 48:15.600
 So now we've got this balanced pie.

48:15.600 --> 48:17.600
 And that's basically what I understood

48:17.600 --> 48:20.500
 as a graduate student in 1975

48:20.500 --> 48:22.400
 about this idea of supersymmetry,

48:22.400 --> 48:24.300
 that it was going to fill up these two quadrants

48:24.300 --> 48:25.900
 of the pie in a way that no one

48:25.900 --> 48:27.700
 had ever thought about before.

48:27.700 --> 48:30.200
 So I was amazed that no one else at MIT

48:30.200 --> 48:32.300
 found this an interesting idea.

48:32.300 --> 48:37.300
 So it led to my becoming the first person in MIT

48:37.300 --> 48:39.500
 to really study supersymmetry.

48:39.500 --> 48:42.600
 This is 1975, 76, 77.

48:42.600 --> 48:44.900
 And in 77, I wrote the first PhD thesis

48:44.900 --> 48:47.100
 in the physics department on this idea

48:47.100 --> 48:49.600
 because I was drawn to the balance.

48:50.500 --> 48:51.700
 Drawn to the symmetry.

48:51.700 --> 48:56.800
 So what does that, first of all,

48:56.800 --> 49:01.200
 is this fundamentally a mathematical idea?

49:01.200 --> 49:04.400
 So how much experimental, and we'll have this theme.

49:04.400 --> 49:05.600
 It's a really interesting one.

49:05.600 --> 49:08.200
 When you explore the world of the small

49:08.200 --> 49:11.200
 and in your new book talking about

49:11.200 --> 49:14.100
 Approving Einstein, right, that we'll also talk about,

49:14.100 --> 49:16.700
 there's this theme of kind of starting it,

49:16.700 --> 49:19.600
 exploring crazy ideas first in the mathematics

49:19.600 --> 49:23.000
 and then seeking for ways to experimentally validate them.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.600
 Where do you put supersymmetry in that?

49:25.600 --> 49:28.200
 It's closer than string theory.

49:28.200 --> 49:30.700
 It has not yet been validated.

49:30.700 --> 49:33.200
 In some sense, you mentioned Einstein,

49:33.200 --> 49:35.400
 so let's go there for a moment.

49:35.400 --> 49:37.000
 In our book, Approving Einstein Right,

49:37.000 --> 49:38.800
 we actually do talk about the fact

49:38.800 --> 49:42.900
 that Albert Einstein in 1915 wrote a set of equations

49:42.900 --> 49:45.100
 which were very different from Newton's equations

49:45.100 --> 49:46.800
 in describing gravity.

49:46.800 --> 49:48.900
 These equations made some predictions

49:48.900 --> 49:51.200
 that were different from Newton's predictions.

49:51.200 --> 49:53.100
 It actually made three different predictions.

49:53.100 --> 49:55.000
 One of them was not actually a prediction,

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
 but a postdiction, because it was known

49:57.000 --> 49:59.500
 that Mercury was not orbiting the sun

49:59.500 --> 50:01.600
 in the way that Newton would have told you.

50:01.600 --> 50:05.400
 And so Einstein's theory actually describes Mercury

50:05.400 --> 50:08.200
 orbiting in a way that was observed

50:08.200 --> 50:09.800
 as opposed to what Newton would have told you.

50:09.800 --> 50:11.600
 So that was one prediction.

50:11.600 --> 50:13.400
 The second prediction that came out of

50:13.400 --> 50:14.700
 the theory of general relativity,

50:14.700 --> 50:17.400
 which Einstein wrote in 1915,

50:17.400 --> 50:19.000
 was that if you,

50:21.000 --> 50:23.400
 so let me describe an experiment and come back to it.

50:23.400 --> 50:25.400
 Suppose I had a glass of water,

50:25.400 --> 50:28.800
 and I filled the glass up,

50:28.800 --> 50:31.000
 and then I moved the glass slowly back and forth

50:31.000 --> 50:32.800
 between our two faces.

50:33.800 --> 50:36.600
 It would appear to me like your face was moving,

50:36.600 --> 50:38.000
 even though you weren't moving.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
 I mean, it's actually, and what's causing it

50:40.000 --> 50:42.200
 is because the light gets bent through the glass

50:42.200 --> 50:45.000
 as it passes from your face to my eye.

50:45.000 --> 50:50.000
 So Einstein in his 1915 theory of general relativity

50:50.800 --> 50:54.400
 found out that gravity has the same effect on light

50:54.400 --> 50:55.400
 as that glass of water.

50:55.400 --> 50:58.200
 It would cause beams of light to bend.

50:58.200 --> 51:01.000
 Now, Newton also knew this,

51:01.000 --> 51:02.600
 but Einstein's prediction was that light

51:02.600 --> 51:04.800
 would bend twice as much.

51:04.800 --> 51:07.200
 And so here's a mathematical idea.

51:07.200 --> 51:09.000
 Now, how do you actually prove it?

51:09.000 --> 51:11.400
 Well, you've got to watch.

51:11.400 --> 51:15.800
 Just a quick pause on that, just the language you're using.

51:15.800 --> 51:17.800
 He found out.

51:17.800 --> 51:19.600
 I can say he did a calculation.

51:19.600 --> 51:21.200
 It's a really interesting notion

51:21.200 --> 51:25.200
 that one of the beautiful things about this universe

51:25.200 --> 51:28.000
 is you can do a calculation

51:28.000 --> 51:30.900
 and combine with some of that magical intuition

51:30.900 --> 51:35.200
 that physicists have, actually predict what would be,

51:35.200 --> 51:37.600
 what's possible to experimentally validate.

51:37.600 --> 51:38.440
 That's correct.

51:38.440 --> 51:40.000
 So he found out in the sense

51:40.000 --> 51:43.300
 that there seems to be something here

51:43.300 --> 51:46.000
 and mathematically it should bend,

51:46.000 --> 51:48.500
 gravity should bend light this amount.

51:48.500 --> 51:51.400
 And so therefore that's something that could be potentially,

51:51.400 --> 51:53.300
 and then come up with an experiment that could be validated.

51:53.300 --> 51:54.400
 Right.

51:54.400 --> 51:57.300
 And that's the way that actually modern physics,

51:57.300 --> 52:00.900
 deeply fundamental modern physics, this is how it works.

52:02.400 --> 52:04.400
 Earlier we spoke about the Higgs boson.

52:04.400 --> 52:06.000
 So why did we go looking for it?

52:06.000 --> 52:10.900
 The answer is that back in the late 60s and early 70s,

52:10.900 --> 52:12.700
 some people wrote some equations

52:12.700 --> 52:15.500
 and the equations predicted this.

52:15.500 --> 52:17.100
 So then we went looking for it.

52:18.500 --> 52:21.300
 So on supersymmetry for a second,

52:21.300 --> 52:25.100
 there's these things called idynchrous symbols,

52:25.100 --> 52:26.700
 these strange little graphs.

52:26.700 --> 52:27.700
 Yes.

52:27.700 --> 52:29.500
 You refer to them as revealing something

52:29.500 --> 52:32.700
 like binary code underlying reality.

52:32.700 --> 52:34.900
 First of all, can you describe these graphs?

52:34.900 --> 52:36.700
 Describe these graphs, what are they?

52:38.100 --> 52:40.700
 What are these beautiful little strange graphs?

52:40.700 --> 52:44.800
 Well, first of all, idynchrous are an invention of mine,

52:44.800 --> 52:46.900
 together with a colleague named Michael Fox.

52:46.900 --> 52:50.000
 In 2005, we were looking at equations.

52:50.000 --> 52:51.800
 Well, the story's a little bit more complicated

52:51.800 --> 52:54.000
 and it'll take too long to explain all the details,

52:54.000 --> 52:55.600
 but the Reader's Digest version

52:55.600 --> 52:58.000
 is that we were looking at these equations

52:58.000 --> 53:01.100
 and we figured out that all the data

53:01.100 --> 53:04.600
 in a certain class of equations could be put in pictures.

53:04.600 --> 53:06.400
 And the pictures, what do they look like?

53:06.400 --> 53:09.400
 Well, they're just little balls.

53:09.400 --> 53:12.100
 You have black balls and white balls.

53:12.100 --> 53:14.100
 Those stand for those two buckets, by the way,

53:14.100 --> 53:15.700
 that we talked about in reality.

53:15.700 --> 53:18.600
 The white balls are things that are like particles of light.

53:18.600 --> 53:20.800
 The black balls are like electrons.

53:20.800 --> 53:24.400
 And then you can draw lines connecting these balls.

53:24.400 --> 53:27.400
 And these lines are deeply mathematical objects

53:27.400 --> 53:29.100
 and there's no way for me to,

53:29.100 --> 53:33.900
 I have no physical model for telling you what the lines are.

53:33.900 --> 53:36.200
 But if you were a mathematician,

53:36.200 --> 53:37.900
 I would do a technical phrase saying,

53:37.900 --> 53:39.600
 this is the orbit of the representation

53:39.600 --> 53:41.900
 and the action of the symmetry generators.

53:41.900 --> 53:43.600
 Mathematicians wouldn't understand that.

53:43.600 --> 53:45.100
 Nobody else in their right mind would,

53:45.100 --> 53:47.000
 so let's not go there.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.700
 So, but we figured out that the data

53:49.700 --> 53:52.000
 that was in the equations was in these funny pictures

53:52.000 --> 53:53.800
 that we could draw.

53:53.800 --> 53:55.500
 And so that was stunning,

53:56.900 --> 53:59.700
 but it also was encouraging

53:59.700 --> 54:02.400
 because there are problems with the equations,

54:02.400 --> 54:06.700
 which I had first learned about in 1979

54:06.700 --> 54:07.900
 when I was down at Harvard

54:07.900 --> 54:09.900
 and I went out to Caltech for the first time

54:09.900 --> 54:11.700
 and working with a great scientist

54:11.700 --> 54:12.700
 by the name of John Schwartz.

54:12.700 --> 54:16.000
 There are problems in the equations we don't know how to solve.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.300
 And so one of the things about solving problems

54:18.300 --> 54:20.100
 that you don't know how to solve

54:20.100 --> 54:22.800
 is that beating your head against a brick wall

54:22.800 --> 54:25.900
 is probably not a good philosophy about how to solve it.

54:25.900 --> 54:26.800
 So what do you need to do?

54:26.800 --> 54:29.300
 You need to change your sense of reference,

54:29.300 --> 54:31.300
 your frame of reference, your perspective.

54:31.300 --> 54:35.100
 So when I saw these funny pictures,

54:35.100 --> 54:37.500
 I thought, gee, that might be a way

54:37.500 --> 54:39.000
 to solve these problems with equations

54:39.000 --> 54:41.800
 that we don't know how to do.

54:41.800 --> 54:44.400
 So that was for me one of the first attractions

54:44.400 --> 54:46.900
 is that I now had an alternative language

54:46.900 --> 54:49.800
 to try to attack a set of mathematical problems.

54:50.700 --> 54:54.600
 But I quickly realized that A,

54:54.600 --> 54:58.100
 this mathematical language was not known by mathematicians,

54:58.100 --> 54:59.900
 which makes it pretty interesting

54:59.900 --> 55:02.700
 because now you have to actually teach mathematicians

55:02.700 --> 55:04.100
 about a piece of mathematics

55:04.100 --> 55:05.900
 because that's how they make their living.

55:05.900 --> 55:08.000
 And the great thing about working with mathematicians,

55:08.000 --> 55:11.100
 of course, is the rigor with which they examine ideas.

55:11.100 --> 55:14.400
 So they make your ideas better than they start out.

55:14.400 --> 55:16.600
 So I start working with a group of mathematicians

55:16.600 --> 55:18.500
 and it was in that collaboration that we figured out

55:18.500 --> 55:20.740
 that these funny pictures had error correcting codes

55:20.740 --> 55:21.580
 buried in them.

55:23.500 --> 55:25.700
 Can you talk about what are error correcting codes?

55:25.700 --> 55:26.700
 Ah, sure.

55:26.700 --> 55:30.900
 So the simplest way to talk about error correcting codes

55:32.100 --> 55:36.800
 is first of all, to talk about digital information.

55:36.800 --> 55:39.600
 Digital information is basically strings of ones and zeros.

55:39.600 --> 55:41.100
 They're called bits.

55:41.100 --> 55:45.700
 So now let's imagine that I want to send you some bits.

55:46.700 --> 55:50.300
 Well, maybe I could show you pictures,

55:50.300 --> 55:52.200
 but maybe it's a rainy day

55:52.200 --> 55:56.300
 or maybe the windows in your house are foggy.

55:56.300 --> 55:59.300
 So sometimes when I show you a zero,

55:59.300 --> 56:01.600
 you might interpret it as a one.

56:01.600 --> 56:03.300
 Or other times when I show you a one,

56:03.300 --> 56:05.800
 you might interpret it as a zero.

56:05.800 --> 56:07.100
 So if that's the case,

56:07.100 --> 56:08.800
 that means when I try to send you this data,

56:08.800 --> 56:11.000
 it comes to you in corrupted form.

56:11.000 --> 56:14.300
 And so the challenge is how do you get it to be uncorrupted?

56:15.500 --> 56:20.500
 In the 1940s, a computer scientist named Hamming

56:21.700 --> 56:24.700
 addressed the problem of how do you reliably transmit

56:24.700 --> 56:26.200
 digital information?

56:26.200 --> 56:29.400
 And what he came up with was a brilliant idea.

56:29.400 --> 56:31.300
 Now, the way that you solve it

56:31.300 --> 56:33.200
 is that you take the data that you want to send,

56:33.200 --> 56:34.900
 the ones in your strings of ones and zeros,

56:34.900 --> 56:36.100
 your favorite string,

56:36.100 --> 56:38.000
 and then you dump more ones and zeros in,

56:38.000 --> 56:41.200
 but you dump them in in a particular pattern.

56:41.200 --> 56:42.900
 And this particular pattern

56:42.900 --> 56:45.300
 is what a Hamming code is all about.

56:45.300 --> 56:46.600
 So it's an error correcting code

56:46.600 --> 56:48.400
 because if the person at the other end

56:48.400 --> 56:49.800
 knows what the pattern's supposed to be,

56:49.800 --> 56:52.200
 they can figure out when one's got changed to zeros,

56:52.200 --> 56:53.700
 zero's got changed to one.

56:53.700 --> 56:57.500
 So it turned out that our strange little objects

56:57.500 --> 56:59.300
 that came from looking at the equations

56:59.300 --> 57:00.800
 that we couldn't solve,

57:00.800 --> 57:02.700
 it turns out that when you look at them deeply enough,

57:02.700 --> 57:06.200
 you find out that they have ones and zeros

57:06.200 --> 57:07.500
 buried in them.

57:07.500 --> 57:08.800
 But even more astoundingly,

57:08.800 --> 57:10.800
 the ones and zeros are not there randomly.

57:10.800 --> 57:14.200
 They are in the pattern of error correcting codes.

57:14.200 --> 57:16.000
 So this was an astounding thing

57:16.000 --> 57:19.000
 that when we first got this result

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
 and tried to publish it,

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
 it took us three years to convince other physicists

57:22.000 --> 57:23.800
 that we weren't crazy.

57:23.800 --> 57:25.200
 Eventually we were able to publish it,

57:25.200 --> 57:27.400
 I and this collaboration of mathematicians

57:27.400 --> 57:29.300
 and other physicists.

57:29.300 --> 57:31.400
 And so ever since then,

57:31.400 --> 57:34.400
 I have actually been looking at the mathematics

57:34.400 --> 57:35.900
 of these objects,

57:35.900 --> 57:39.200
 trying to still understand properties of the equations.

57:39.200 --> 57:40.800
 And I want to understand the properties of equations

57:40.800 --> 57:43.300
 because I want to be able to try things like electrons.

57:43.300 --> 57:44.300
 So as you can see,

57:44.300 --> 57:46.200
 it's just like a two step removed process

57:46.200 --> 57:48.400
 of trying to get back to reality.

57:48.400 --> 57:50.900
 So what would you say is the most beautiful property

57:50.900 --> 57:55.900
 of these Adinkra graphs, objects?

57:56.000 --> 57:58.100
 What do you think, by the way, the word symbols,

57:58.100 --> 58:01.600
 what do you think of them, these simple graphs?

58:01.600 --> 58:04.200
 Are they objects or?

58:04.200 --> 58:06.000
 How should we think about that?

58:06.000 --> 58:08.300
 For people who work with mathematics like me,

58:08.300 --> 58:11.500
 our mathematical concepts are,

58:11.500 --> 58:13.000
 we often refer to them as objects

58:13.000 --> 58:15.200
 because they feel like real things.

58:15.200 --> 58:17.800
 Even though you can't see them or touch them,

58:17.800 --> 58:21.000
 they're so much part of your interior life

58:21.000 --> 58:23.700
 that it is as if you could.

58:23.700 --> 58:26.000
 So we often refer to these things as objects,

58:26.000 --> 58:28.400
 even though there's nothing objective about them.

58:28.400 --> 58:31.600
 And what does a single graph represent in space?

58:31.600 --> 58:34.000
 Okay, so the simplest of these graphs

58:34.000 --> 58:36.600
 has to have one white ball and one black ball.

58:36.600 --> 58:38.400
 That's that balance that we talked about earlier.

58:38.400 --> 58:40.200
 Remember, we want to balance out the quadrants?

58:40.200 --> 58:42.200
 Well, you can't do it unless you have

58:42.200 --> 58:43.800
 a black ball and white ball.

58:43.800 --> 58:46.800
 So the simplest of these objects looks like two little balls,

58:46.800 --> 58:49.400
 one black, one white, connected by a single line.

58:49.400 --> 58:51.800
 And what it's talking about is, as I said,

58:51.800 --> 58:54.700
 a deep mathematical property related to symmetry.

58:54.700 --> 58:56.300
 You've mentioned the error correcting codes,

58:56.300 --> 58:58.500
 but is there a particular beautiful property

58:58.500 --> 59:00.400
 that stands out to you about these objects

59:00.400 --> 59:01.500
 that you just find?

59:01.500 --> 59:03.100
 Yes, yes, there is.

59:03.100 --> 59:04.400
 Early on in the development of it.

59:04.400 --> 59:05.500
 Yes, there is.

59:05.500 --> 59:08.800
 The craziest thing about these to me

59:10.600 --> 59:14.200
 is that when you look at physics

59:14.200 --> 59:17.000
 and try to write equations where information

59:17.000 --> 59:18.600
 gets transmitted reliably,

59:20.000 --> 59:22.200
 if you're in one of these super symmetrical systems

59:22.200 --> 59:23.800
 with this extra symmetry,

59:23.800 --> 59:24.900
 that doesn't happen unless there's

59:24.900 --> 59:26.800
 an error correcting code present.

59:26.800 --> 59:29.100
 So it's as if the universe says,

59:29.100 --> 59:31.000
 you don't retransmit information

59:31.000 --> 59:33.200
 unless there's something about an error correcting code.

59:33.200 --> 59:35.200
 This to me is the craziest thing

59:35.200 --> 59:38.300
 that I've ever personally encountered in my research.

59:38.300 --> 59:41.000
 And it's actually got me to wondering

59:41.000 --> 59:42.400
 how this could come about,

59:42.400 --> 59:44.500
 because the only place in nature

59:44.500 --> 59:47.500
 that we know about error correcting codes is genetics.

59:47.500 --> 59:50.100
 And in genetics, we think it was evolution

59:50.100 --> 59:53.100
 that causes error correcting codes to be in genomes.

59:53.100 --> 59:54.200
 And so does that mean that there was

59:54.200 --> 59:55.600
 some kind of form of evolution

59:55.600 --> 59:58.100
 acting on the mathematical laws of the physics

59:58.100 --> 59:59.400
 of our universe?

59:59.400 --> 1:00:01.500
 This is a very bizarre and strange idea.

1:00:01.500 --> 1:00:02.500
 And it's something I've wondered about

1:00:02.500 --> 1:00:05.300
 from time to time since making these discoveries.

1:00:05.300 --> 1:00:08.100
 Do you think such an idea could be fundamental,

1:00:08.100 --> 1:00:09.700
 or is it emergent throughout

1:00:09.700 --> 1:00:12.200
 all the different kinds of systems?

1:00:12.200 --> 1:00:15.900
 I don't know whether it's fundamental.

1:00:15.900 --> 1:00:18.100
 I probably will not live to find out.

1:00:18.100 --> 1:00:20.700
 This is gonna be the work of probably some future

1:00:20.700 --> 1:00:22.100
 either mathematician or physicist

1:00:22.100 --> 1:00:24.700
 to figure out what these things actually mean.

1:00:24.700 --> 1:00:27.900
 We have to talk a bit about the magical,

1:00:27.900 --> 1:00:31.300
 the mysterious string theory, super string theory.

1:00:31.300 --> 1:00:32.100
 Sure.

1:00:32.100 --> 1:00:35.300
 There's still maybe this aspect of it,

1:00:35.300 --> 1:00:37.900
 which is there's still for me

1:00:37.900 --> 1:00:39.500
 from an outsider's perspective,

1:00:39.500 --> 1:00:42.000
 this fascinating heated debate.

1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:44.600
 On the status of string theory.

1:00:44.600 --> 1:00:46.600
 Can you clarify this debate,

1:00:46.600 --> 1:00:48.700
 perhaps articulating the various views

1:00:48.700 --> 1:00:50.700
 and say where you land on it?

1:00:50.700 --> 1:00:53.200
 So first of all, I doubt that I will be able

1:00:53.200 --> 1:00:55.700
 to say anything to clarify the debate

1:00:55.700 --> 1:01:00.700
 around string theory for a general audience.

1:01:01.400 --> 1:01:03.700
 Part of the reason is because string theory

1:01:05.100 --> 1:01:08.600
 has done something I've never seen the erectal physics do.

1:01:08.600 --> 1:01:10.800
 It has broken out into consciousness

1:01:10.800 --> 1:01:13.400
 of the general public before we're finished.

1:01:13.400 --> 1:01:15.800
 You see, string theory doesn't actually exist

1:01:15.800 --> 1:01:17.100
 because when we use the word theory,

1:01:17.100 --> 1:01:20.100
 we mean a particular set of attributes.

1:01:20.100 --> 1:01:21.500
 In particular, it means that you have

1:01:21.500 --> 1:01:23.900
 an overarching paradigm that explains

1:01:23.900 --> 1:01:25.900
 what it is that you're doing.

1:01:25.900 --> 1:01:29.900
 No such overarching paradigm exists for string theory.

1:01:29.900 --> 1:01:31.800
 What string theory is currently

1:01:31.800 --> 1:01:35.200
 is an enormously large mutually reinforcing collection

1:01:35.200 --> 1:01:39.500
 of mathematical facts in which we can find no contradictions.

1:01:39.500 --> 1:01:41.600
 We don't know why it's there,

1:01:41.600 --> 1:01:44.700
 but we can certainly say that without challenge.

1:01:44.700 --> 1:01:46.500
 Now, just because you find a piece of mathematics

1:01:46.500 --> 1:01:49.200
 doesn't mean that this applies to nature.

1:01:49.200 --> 1:01:53.200
 And in fact, there has been a very heated debate

1:01:53.200 --> 1:01:57.200
 about whether string theory is some sort of hysteria

1:01:57.200 --> 1:02:00.000
 among the community of theoretical physicists,

1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:01.400
 or whether it has something fundamental

1:02:01.400 --> 1:02:04.400
 to say about our universe.

1:02:04.400 --> 1:02:07.900
 We don't yet know the answer to that question.

1:02:07.900 --> 1:02:09.800
 What those of us who study string theory

1:02:09.800 --> 1:02:12.300
 will tell you are things like,

1:02:12.300 --> 1:02:14.700
 string theory has been extraordinarily productive

1:02:14.700 --> 1:02:16.600
 in getting us to think more deeply,

1:02:16.600 --> 1:02:19.500
 even about mathematics that's not string theory,

1:02:19.500 --> 1:02:20.900
 but the kind of mathematics

1:02:20.900 --> 1:02:23.800
 that we've used to describe elementary particles.

1:02:23.800 --> 1:02:25.600
 There have been spin offs from string theory,

1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:28.500
 and this has been going on now for two decades almost,

1:02:28.500 --> 1:02:31.000
 that have allowed us, for example,

1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:34.300
 to more accurately calculate the force between electrons

1:02:34.300 --> 1:02:36.600
 with the presence of quantum mechanics.

1:02:36.600 --> 1:02:39.100
 This is not something you hear about in the public.

1:02:39.100 --> 1:02:40.800
 There are other similar things.

1:02:42.600 --> 1:02:44.700
 That kind of property I just told you about

1:02:44.700 --> 1:02:46.700
 is what's called weak strong duality,

1:02:46.700 --> 1:02:48.900
 and it comes directly from string theory.

1:02:48.900 --> 1:02:51.800
 There are other things such as

1:02:53.600 --> 1:02:55.500
 a property called holography,

1:02:55.500 --> 1:02:59.600
 which allows one to take equations

1:02:59.600 --> 1:03:01.800
 and look at them on the boundary of a space,

1:03:01.800 --> 1:03:04.000
 and then to know information about inside a space

1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:06.400
 without actually doing calculations there.

1:03:06.400 --> 1:03:08.000
 This has come directly from string theory.

1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:12.500
 So there are a number of direct mathematical effects

1:03:12.500 --> 1:03:14.100
 that we learn as string theory,

1:03:14.100 --> 1:03:16.500
 but we take these ideas and look at math

1:03:16.500 --> 1:03:18.100
 that we already know and we find suddenly

1:03:18.100 --> 1:03:19.400
 we're more powerful.

1:03:19.400 --> 1:03:20.700
 This is a pretty good indication

1:03:20.700 --> 1:03:22.100
 there's something interesting going on

1:03:22.100 --> 1:03:23.100
 with string theory itself.

1:03:23.100 --> 1:03:24.300
 So it's the early days

1:03:24.300 --> 1:03:25.900
 of a powerful mathematical framework.

1:03:25.900 --> 1:03:27.200
 That's what we have right now.

1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:30.300
 What are the big, first of all,

1:03:30.300 --> 1:03:33.400
 most people will probably, which as you said,

1:03:33.400 --> 1:03:35.300
 most general public would know actually

1:03:35.300 --> 1:03:38.800
 what string theory is, which is at the highest level,

1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:41.400
 which is a fascinating fact.

1:03:41.400 --> 1:03:43.000
 Well, string theory is what they do

1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:44.600
 on the Big Bang Theory, right?

1:03:44.600 --> 1:03:49.600
 One, can you maybe describe what is string theory,

1:03:51.100 --> 1:03:55.000
 and two, what are the open challenges?

1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:57.300
 So what is string theory?

1:03:57.300 --> 1:04:01.800
 Well, the simplest explanation I can provide

1:04:01.800 --> 1:04:05.900
 is to go back and ask what are particles,

1:04:05.900 --> 1:04:08.400
 which is the question you first asked me.

1:04:10.200 --> 1:04:11.500
 What's the smallest thing?

1:04:11.500 --> 1:04:13.800
 Yeah, what's the smallest thing?

1:04:13.800 --> 1:04:18.800
 So particles, one way I try to describe particles

1:04:20.400 --> 1:04:21.500
 to people is start,

1:04:21.500 --> 1:04:23.600
 I want you to imagine a little ball

1:04:24.800 --> 1:04:26.700
 and I want you to let the size of that ball shrink

1:04:26.700 --> 1:04:28.800
 until it has no extent whatsoever,

1:04:28.800 --> 1:04:30.900
 but it still has the mass of the ball.

1:04:32.300 --> 1:04:34.900
 That's actually what Newton was working with

1:04:34.900 --> 1:04:36.300
 when he first invented physics.

1:04:36.300 --> 1:04:39.100
 He's the real inventor of the massive particle,

1:04:39.100 --> 1:04:42.500
 which is this idea that underlies all of physics.

1:04:43.600 --> 1:04:44.500
 So that's where we start.

1:04:44.500 --> 1:04:46.700
 It's a mathematical construct

1:04:46.700 --> 1:04:49.300
 that you get by taking a limit of things that you know.

1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:51.900
 So what's a string?

1:04:51.900 --> 1:04:54.300
 Well, in the same analogy, I would say,

1:04:54.300 --> 1:04:57.300
 now I want you to start with a piece of spaghetti.

1:04:57.300 --> 1:04:59.300
 So we all know what that looks like.

1:04:59.300 --> 1:05:03.100
 And now I want you to let the thickness of the spaghetti

1:05:03.100 --> 1:05:05.700
 shrink until it has no thickness.

1:05:05.700 --> 1:05:08.300
 Mathematically, I mean, in words, this makes no sense,

1:05:08.300 --> 1:05:11.300
 but mathematically, this actually works

1:05:11.300 --> 1:05:13.700
 and you get this mathematical object out.

1:05:13.700 --> 1:05:15.700
 It has properties that are like spaghetti.

1:05:15.700 --> 1:05:17.400
 It can wiggle and jiggle,

1:05:17.400 --> 1:05:19.900
 but it can also move collectively

1:05:19.900 --> 1:05:21.500
 like a piece of spaghetti.

1:05:21.500 --> 1:05:24.300
 It's the mathematics of those sorts of objects

1:05:24.300 --> 1:05:25.900
 that constitute string theory.

1:05:25.900 --> 1:05:30.900
 And does the multidimensional, 11 dimensional,

1:05:30.900 --> 1:05:34.900
 however many dimensional, more than four dimension,

1:05:34.900 --> 1:05:36.900
 is that a crazy idea to you?

1:05:36.900 --> 1:05:40.900
 Is that the stranger aspect of string theory to you?

1:05:40.900 --> 1:05:45.900
 Not really, and also partly because of my own research.

1:05:45.900 --> 1:05:49.500
 So earlier we talked about these strange symbols

1:05:49.500 --> 1:05:51.900
 that we've discovered inside the equations.

1:05:51.900 --> 1:05:54.100
 It turns out that to a very large extent,

1:05:54.100 --> 1:05:56.500
 a Dinkers don't really care about the number of dimensions.

1:05:56.500 --> 1:05:59.300
 They kind of have an internal mathematical consistency

1:05:59.300 --> 1:06:00.900
 that allows them to be manifested

1:06:00.900 --> 1:06:02.900
 in many different dimensions.

1:06:02.900 --> 1:06:05.300
 Since supersymmetry is a part of string theory,

1:06:05.300 --> 1:06:07.300
 then the same property you would expect

1:06:07.300 --> 1:06:09.300
 to be inherited by string theory.

1:06:09.300 --> 1:06:12.300
 However, another little known fact,

1:06:12.300 --> 1:06:14.100
 which is not in the public debate,

1:06:14.100 --> 1:06:15.700
 is that there are actually strings

1:06:15.700 --> 1:06:17.700
 that are only four dimensional.

1:06:17.700 --> 1:06:19.300
 This is something that was discovered

1:06:19.300 --> 1:06:23.300
 at the end of the 80s by a scientist,

1:06:23.300 --> 1:06:25.300
 by three different groups of physicists

1:06:25.300 --> 1:06:27.300
 working independently.

1:06:27.300 --> 1:06:29.100
 I and my friend Warren Siegel,

1:06:29.100 --> 1:06:31.100
 who were at the University of Maryland at the time,

1:06:31.100 --> 1:06:33.300
 were able to prove that there's mathematics

1:06:33.300 --> 1:06:34.500
 that looks totally four dimensional,

1:06:34.500 --> 1:06:36.100
 and yet it's a string.

1:06:36.100 --> 1:06:37.700
 There was a group in Germany

1:06:37.700 --> 1:06:40.300
 that used slightly different mathematics,

1:06:40.300 --> 1:06:42.100
 but they found the same result.

1:06:42.100 --> 1:06:43.900
 And then there was a group at Cornell

1:06:43.900 --> 1:06:46.100
 who using yet a third piece of mathematics

1:06:46.100 --> 1:06:46.900
 found the same result.

1:06:46.900 --> 1:06:49.900
 So the fact that extra dimensions

1:06:49.900 --> 1:06:53.700
 is so widely talked about in the public

1:06:53.700 --> 1:06:55.700
 is partly a function of how the public

1:06:55.700 --> 1:06:57.300
 has come to understand string theory

1:06:57.300 --> 1:06:59.500
 and how the story has been told to them.

1:06:59.500 --> 1:07:02.500
 But there are alternatives you don't know about.

1:07:02.500 --> 1:07:06.300
 If we could talk about maybe experimental validation,

1:07:06.300 --> 1:07:11.300
 and you're the coauthor of a recently published book,

1:07:11.300 --> 1:07:14.500
 Proving Einstein Right,

1:07:14.500 --> 1:07:16.300
 the human story of it too,

1:07:16.300 --> 1:07:18.100
 the daring expeditions that change

1:07:18.100 --> 1:07:19.900
 how we look at the universe.

1:07:19.900 --> 1:07:22.100
 Do you see echoes of the early days

1:07:22.100 --> 1:07:25.700
 of general relativity in the 1910s

1:07:25.700 --> 1:07:29.900
 to the more stretched out to string theory?

1:07:29.900 --> 1:07:31.100
 I do, I do.

1:07:31.100 --> 1:07:33.500
 And that's one reason why I was happy to focus

1:07:33.500 --> 1:07:38.500
 on the story of how Einstein became a global superstar.

1:07:43.700 --> 1:07:45.500
 Earlier in our discussion,

1:07:45.500 --> 1:07:50.500
 we went over his history where in 1915,

1:07:51.100 --> 1:07:53.900
 he came up with this piece of mathematics,

1:07:53.900 --> 1:07:55.700
 used it to do some calculations

1:07:55.700 --> 1:07:57.060
 and then made a prediction.

1:07:57.060 --> 1:07:58.020
 Yes.

1:07:58.020 --> 1:08:00.180
 But making a prediction is not enough.

1:08:00.180 --> 1:08:02.060
 Someone's got to go out and measure.

1:08:02.940 --> 1:08:07.020
 And so string theory is in that in between zone.

1:08:07.020 --> 1:08:09.940
 Now for Einstein, it was from 1915 to 1919.

1:08:09.940 --> 1:08:14.380
 1915 he makes the correct prediction.

1:08:14.380 --> 1:08:16.420
 By the way, he made an incorrect prediction

1:08:16.420 --> 1:08:17.780
 about the same thing in 1911,

1:08:17.780 --> 1:08:20.340
 but he corrected himself in 1915.

1:08:20.340 --> 1:08:22.420
 And by 1919, the first pieces

1:08:22.420 --> 1:08:27.420
 of experimental observational data became available

1:08:27.620 --> 1:08:31.020
 to say, yes, he's not wrong.

1:08:31.020 --> 1:08:35.940
 And by 1922, the argument that based on observation

1:08:35.940 --> 1:08:38.500
 was overwhelming that he was not wrong.

1:08:38.500 --> 1:08:41.860
 Can you describe what special general relativity are

1:08:41.860 --> 1:08:42.700
 just briefly?

1:08:42.700 --> 1:08:43.540
 Sure.

1:08:43.540 --> 1:08:45.580
 And what prediction Einstein made

1:08:45.580 --> 1:08:50.580
 and maybe some or a memorable moment

1:08:52.580 --> 1:08:56.980
 from the human journey of trying to prove this thing right,

1:08:56.980 --> 1:08:58.060
 which is incredible.

1:08:58.060 --> 1:08:58.900
 Right.

1:08:58.900 --> 1:09:02.580
 So I'm very fortunate to have worked

1:09:02.580 --> 1:09:07.580
 with a talented novelist who wanted to write a book

1:09:07.820 --> 1:09:09.740
 that coincided with a book I wanted to write

1:09:09.740 --> 1:09:14.740
 about how science kind of feels if you're a person,

1:09:14.900 --> 1:09:17.140
 because it's actually people who do science,

1:09:17.140 --> 1:09:19.740
 even though that may not be obvious to everyone.

1:09:20.780 --> 1:09:22.660
 So for me, I wanted to write this book

1:09:22.660 --> 1:09:23.660
 for a couple of reasons.

1:09:23.660 --> 1:09:26.460
 I wanted young people to understand

1:09:26.460 --> 1:09:31.460
 that the seeming alien giants that live before them

1:09:32.180 --> 1:09:34.060
 were just as human as they are.

1:09:34.060 --> 1:09:35.780
 They get married, they get divorced.

1:09:35.780 --> 1:09:37.100
 They get married, they get divorced.

1:09:37.100 --> 1:09:38.500
 They do terrible things.

1:09:38.500 --> 1:09:39.580
 They do great things.

1:09:39.580 --> 1:09:40.420
 They're people.

1:09:40.420 --> 1:09:42.180
 They're just people like you.

1:09:42.180 --> 1:09:44.420
 And so that part of telling the story allowed me

1:09:44.420 --> 1:09:47.020
 to get that out there for both young people interested

1:09:47.020 --> 1:09:49.540
 in the sciences as well as the public.

1:09:49.540 --> 1:09:54.180
 But the other part of the story is I wanted to open up

1:09:54.180 --> 1:09:58.580
 sort of what it was like.

1:09:58.580 --> 1:10:00.460
 Now I'm a scientist.

1:10:00.460 --> 1:10:02.660
 And so I will not pretend to be a great writer.

1:10:02.660 --> 1:10:04.700
 I understand a lot about mathematics

1:10:04.700 --> 1:10:07.100
 and I've even created my own mathematics

1:10:07.100 --> 1:10:11.980
 that is kind of a weird thing to be able to do.

1:10:11.980 --> 1:10:13.980
 But in order to tell the story,

1:10:13.980 --> 1:10:18.100
 you really have to have an incredible master

1:10:18.100 --> 1:10:19.900
 of the narrative.

1:10:19.900 --> 1:10:22.540
 And that was my coauthor, Kathy Pelletier,

1:10:22.540 --> 1:10:24.060
 who is a novelist.

1:10:24.060 --> 1:10:27.620
 So we formed this conjoined brain, I used to call us.

1:10:27.620 --> 1:10:30.100
 She used to call us Professor Higgins and Eliza Doolittle.

1:10:30.100 --> 1:10:33.220
 My expression for us is that we were a conjoined brain

1:10:33.220 --> 1:10:34.980
 to tell this story.

1:10:34.980 --> 1:10:39.740
 And it allowed, so what are some magical moments?

1:10:39.740 --> 1:10:43.900
 To me, the first magical moment in telling the story

1:10:43.900 --> 1:10:48.460
 was looking at Albert Einstein and his struggle

1:10:48.460 --> 1:10:51.700
 because although we regard him as a genius,

1:10:51.700 --> 1:10:54.460
 as I said, in 1911, he actually made an incorrect prediction

1:10:54.460 --> 1:10:55.660
 about bending starlight.

1:10:55.660 --> 1:10:58.060
 And that's actually what set the astronomers off.

1:10:59.780 --> 1:11:02.220
 In 1914, there was an eclipse.

1:11:02.220 --> 1:11:06.220
 And by various accidents of war and weather

1:11:06.220 --> 1:11:08.860
 and all sorts of things that we talk about in the book,

1:11:08.860 --> 1:11:11.100
 no one was able to make the measurement.

1:11:11.100 --> 1:11:13.580
 If they had made the measurement,

1:11:13.580 --> 1:11:18.580
 it would have disagreed with his 1911 prediction

1:11:19.460 --> 1:11:22.020
 because nature only has one answer.

1:11:22.020 --> 1:11:26.020
 And so then you see how fortunate he was

1:11:26.020 --> 1:11:32.740
 that wars and bad weather and accidents and transporting

1:11:32.740 --> 1:11:35.860
 equipment stopped any measurements from being made.

1:11:35.860 --> 1:11:38.780
 So he corrects himself in 1915,

1:11:38.780 --> 1:11:40.180
 but the astronomers are already out there

1:11:40.180 --> 1:11:41.700
 trying to make the measurement.

1:11:41.700 --> 1:11:43.460
 So now he gives them a different number.

1:11:43.460 --> 1:11:46.620
 And it turns out that's the number that nature agrees with.

1:11:46.620 --> 1:11:50.540
 So it gives you a sense of this is a person struggling

1:11:50.540 --> 1:11:52.180
 with something deeply.

1:11:52.180 --> 1:11:56.860
 And although his deep insight led him to this,

1:11:56.860 --> 1:12:01.260
 it is the circumstance of time, place and accident

1:12:01.260 --> 1:12:03.740
 but through which we view him.

1:12:03.740 --> 1:12:06.980
 And the story could have turned out very differently

1:12:06.980 --> 1:12:09.620
 where first he makes a prediction,

1:12:09.620 --> 1:12:11.900
 the measurements are made in 1914,

1:12:11.900 --> 1:12:13.580
 they disagree with his prediction.

1:12:13.580 --> 1:12:15.620
 And so what would the world view him as?

1:12:15.620 --> 1:12:17.540
 Well, he's this professor who made this prediction

1:12:17.540 --> 1:12:20.540
 that didn't get it right, yes?

1:12:20.540 --> 1:12:26.220
 So the fragility of human history

1:12:26.220 --> 1:12:27.620
 is illustrated by that story.

1:12:27.620 --> 1:12:29.540
 And it's one of my favorite things.

1:12:29.540 --> 1:12:32.460
 You also learn things like in our book,

1:12:32.460 --> 1:12:36.180
 how eclipses and watching eclipses was a driver

1:12:36.180 --> 1:12:37.940
 of the development of science in our nation

1:12:37.940 --> 1:12:38.780
 when it was very young.

1:12:38.780 --> 1:12:40.620
 In fact, even before we were a nation,

1:12:40.620 --> 1:12:47.180
 it turns out there were citizens of this would be country

1:12:47.180 --> 1:12:50.580
 that were going out trying to measure eclipses.

1:12:50.580 --> 1:12:54.820
 So some fortune, some misfortune affects

1:12:54.820 --> 1:12:56.740
 the progress of science.

1:12:56.740 --> 1:12:57.660
 Absolutely.

1:12:57.660 --> 1:13:01.740
 Especially with ideas as, to me at least,

1:13:01.740 --> 1:13:03.620
 if I put myself back in those days,

1:13:03.620 --> 1:13:08.380
 as radical as general relativity is.

1:13:08.380 --> 1:13:12.100
 First, can you describe, if it's OK briefly,

1:13:12.100 --> 1:13:14.180
 what general relativity is?

1:13:14.180 --> 1:13:18.500
 And yeah, could you just take a moment of, yeah,

1:13:18.500 --> 1:13:22.460
 put yourself in those shoes in the academic researchers,

1:13:22.460 --> 1:13:25.180
 scientists of that time, and what is this theory?

1:13:25.180 --> 1:13:28.660
 What is it trying to describe about our world?

1:13:28.660 --> 1:13:34.740
 It's trying to answer the thing that left Isaac Newton puzzled.

1:13:37.620 --> 1:13:39.740
 Isaac Newton says gravity magically

1:13:39.740 --> 1:13:41.700
 goes from one place to another.

1:13:41.700 --> 1:13:43.300
 He doesn't believe it, by the way.

1:13:43.300 --> 1:13:45.340
 He knows that's not right.

1:13:45.340 --> 1:13:48.220
 But the mathematics is so good that you have to say,

1:13:48.220 --> 1:13:52.020
 well, I'll throw my qualms away because I'll use it.

1:13:52.020 --> 1:13:55.020
 That's all we used to get a man from the Earth to the moon

1:13:55.020 --> 1:13:58.420
 was that mathematics.

1:13:58.420 --> 1:14:03.460
 So I'm one of those scientists, and I've seen this.

1:14:03.460 --> 1:14:04.860
 And if I thought deeply about it,

1:14:04.860 --> 1:14:08.700
 maybe I know that Newton himself wasn't comfortable.

1:14:08.700 --> 1:14:11.100
 And so the first thing I would hope that I would feel

1:14:11.100 --> 1:14:13.300
 is, gee, there's this young kid out there who

1:14:13.300 --> 1:14:17.820
 has an idea to fill in this hole that was left with us

1:14:17.820 --> 1:14:19.780
 by Sir Isaac Newton.

1:14:19.780 --> 1:14:23.100
 That, I hope, would be my reaction.

1:14:23.100 --> 1:14:24.820
 I have a suspicion.

1:14:24.820 --> 1:14:29.020
 I'm kind of a mathematical creature.

1:14:29.020 --> 1:14:30.300
 I was four years old when I first

1:14:30.300 --> 1:14:33.700
 decided that science was what I wanted to do with my life.

1:14:33.700 --> 1:14:38.820
 And so if my personality back then was like it is now,

1:14:38.820 --> 1:14:41.180
 I think it's probably likely I would

1:14:41.180 --> 1:14:43.620
 want to have studied his mathematics.

1:14:43.620 --> 1:14:45.380
 What was a piece of mathematics that he was

1:14:45.380 --> 1:14:47.660
 using to make this prediction?

1:14:47.660 --> 1:14:50.060
 Because he didn't actually create that mathematics.

1:14:50.060 --> 1:14:52.180
 That mathematics was created roughly 50 years

1:14:52.180 --> 1:14:53.300
 before he lived.

1:14:53.300 --> 1:14:56.420
 He's the person who harnessed it in order

1:14:56.420 --> 1:14:57.260
 to make a prediction.

1:14:57.260 --> 1:15:00.780
 In fact, he had to be taught this mathematics by a friend.

1:15:00.780 --> 1:15:03.700
 So this is in our book.

1:15:03.700 --> 1:15:08.140
 So putting myself in that time, I would want to, like I said,

1:15:08.140 --> 1:15:09.340
 I think I would feel excitement.

1:15:09.340 --> 1:15:10.900
 I would want to know what the mathematics is.

1:15:10.900 --> 1:15:13.580
 And then I would want to do the calculations myself.

1:15:13.580 --> 1:15:16.660
 Because one thing that physics is all about

1:15:16.660 --> 1:15:19.420
 is that you don't have to take anybody's word for anything.

1:15:19.420 --> 1:15:20.980
 You can do it yourself.

1:15:20.980 --> 1:15:23.060
 It does seem that mathematics is a little bit more

1:15:23.060 --> 1:15:25.540
 tolerant of radical ideas, or mathematicians,

1:15:25.540 --> 1:15:28.580
 or people who find beauty in mathematics.

1:15:31.780 --> 1:15:33.620
 All the white questions have no good answer.

1:15:33.620 --> 1:15:35.860
 But let me ask, why do you think Einstein never

1:15:35.860 --> 1:15:38.540
 got the Nobel Prize for general relativity?

1:15:38.540 --> 1:15:40.260
 He got it for the photoelectric effect.

1:15:40.260 --> 1:15:41.020
 That is correct.

1:15:41.020 --> 1:15:42.860
 Well, first of all, that's something

1:15:42.860 --> 1:15:46.060
 that is misunderstood about the Nobel Prize in physics.

1:15:46.060 --> 1:15:48.620
 The Nobel Prize in physics is never

1:15:48.620 --> 1:15:54.060
 given for purely proposing an idea.

1:15:54.060 --> 1:15:57.420
 It is always given for proposing an idea that

1:15:57.420 --> 1:15:59.700
 has observational support.

1:15:59.700 --> 1:16:02.340
 So he could not get the Nobel Prize

1:16:02.340 --> 1:16:05.300
 for either special relativity nor general relativity,

1:16:05.300 --> 1:16:08.700
 because the provisions that Alfred Nobel left for the award

1:16:08.700 --> 1:16:11.060
 prevent that.

1:16:11.060 --> 1:16:16.100
 But after it's been validated, can he not get it then, or no?

1:16:16.100 --> 1:16:19.540
 Yes, but remember the validation doesn't really

1:16:19.540 --> 1:16:21.820
 come until the 1920s.

1:16:21.820 --> 1:16:24.500
 But that's why they invented the second Nobel Prize.

1:16:24.500 --> 1:16:28.140
 I mean, Marie Curie, you can get a second Nobel Prize

1:16:28.140 --> 1:16:31.540
 for one of the greatest theories in physics.

1:16:31.540 --> 1:16:33.740
 So let's be clear on this.

1:16:33.740 --> 1:16:39.780
 The theory of general relativity had its critics

1:16:39.780 --> 1:16:43.020
 even up until the 50s.

1:16:43.020 --> 1:16:47.820
 So if the committee had wanted to give

1:16:47.820 --> 1:16:50.300
 the prize for general relativity,

1:16:50.300 --> 1:16:54.180
 there were vociferous critics of general relativity

1:16:54.180 --> 1:16:56.740
 up until the 50s.

1:16:56.740 --> 1:16:59.740
 Einstein died in 1955.

1:16:59.740 --> 1:17:04.300
 What lessons do you draw from the story you tell in the book,

1:17:04.300 --> 1:17:07.060
 from general relativity, from the radical nature

1:17:07.060 --> 1:17:12.900
 of the theory, to looking at the future of string theory?

1:17:12.900 --> 1:17:14.980
 Well, I think that the string theorists are probably

1:17:14.980 --> 1:17:17.900
 going to retrace this path.

1:17:17.900 --> 1:17:20.020
 But it's going to be far longer and more torturous,

1:17:20.020 --> 1:17:22.140
 in my opinion.

1:17:22.140 --> 1:17:29.140
 String theory is such a broad and deep development

1:17:29.140 --> 1:17:34.180
 that, in my opinion, when it becomes acceptable,

1:17:34.180 --> 1:17:38.060
 it's going to be because of a confluence of observations.

1:17:38.060 --> 1:17:40.620
 It's not going to be a single observation.

1:17:40.620 --> 1:17:44.620
 And I have to tell you that, so I gave a seminar here

1:17:44.620 --> 1:17:46.500
 yesterday at MIT.

1:17:46.500 --> 1:17:50.860
 And it's on an idea I have about how string theory can

1:17:50.860 --> 1:17:53.980
 leave signatures in the cosmic microwave background, which

1:17:53.980 --> 1:17:56.860
 is an astrophysical structure.

1:17:56.860 --> 1:18:01.580
 And so if those kinds of observations are borne out,

1:18:01.580 --> 1:18:05.580
 if perhaps other things related to the idea of supersymmetry

1:18:05.580 --> 1:18:08.900
 are borne out, those are going to be the first powerful

1:18:08.900 --> 1:18:12.340
 observationally based pieces of evidence that

1:18:12.340 --> 1:18:18.060
 will begin to do what the Eddington expedition did

1:18:18.060 --> 1:18:19.620
 in 1919.

1:18:19.620 --> 1:18:22.900
 But that may take several decades.

1:18:22.900 --> 1:18:25.060
 Do you think there will be Nobel prizes given

1:18:25.060 --> 1:18:26.220
 for string theory?

1:18:26.220 --> 1:18:34.980
 No, because I think it will exceed normal human lifetimes.

1:18:34.980 --> 1:18:38.140
 But there are other prizes that are given.

1:18:38.140 --> 1:18:42.220
 I mean, there is something called the Breakthrough Prize.

1:18:42.220 --> 1:18:45.020
 There's a Russian immigrant, a Russian American immigrant

1:18:45.020 --> 1:18:48.420
 named Yuri Milner, I believe his name,

1:18:48.420 --> 1:18:53.020
 started this wonderful prize called the Breakthrough Prize.

1:18:53.020 --> 1:18:56.100
 It's three times as much money as the Nobel Prize.

1:18:56.100 --> 1:18:58.100
 And it gets awarded every year.

1:18:58.100 --> 1:19:00.300
 And so something like one of those prizes

1:19:00.300 --> 1:19:04.020
 is likely to be garnered at some point far earlier

1:19:04.020 --> 1:19:07.660
 than a Nobel award.

1:19:07.660 --> 1:19:09.780
 Jumping around a few topics.

1:19:09.780 --> 1:19:11.900
 While you were at Caltech, you've

1:19:11.900 --> 1:19:15.340
 gotten to interact, I believe, with Richard Feynman,

1:19:15.340 --> 1:19:16.300
 I have to ask.

1:19:16.300 --> 1:19:19.100
 Yes, Richard Feynman, indeed.

1:19:19.100 --> 1:19:20.540
 Do you have any stories that stand out

1:19:20.540 --> 1:19:21.660
 in your memory of that time?

1:19:21.660 --> 1:19:23.660
 I have a fair number of stories, but I'm not

1:19:23.660 --> 1:19:24.980
 prepared to tell them.

1:19:24.980 --> 1:19:26.820
 They're not all politically correct.

1:19:26.820 --> 1:19:28.620
 Let me see.

1:19:28.620 --> 1:19:31.060
 Let me just say, I'll say the following.

1:19:31.060 --> 1:19:33.980
 Richard Feynman, if you've ever read

1:19:33.980 --> 1:19:36.420
 some of the books about him, in particular,

1:19:36.420 --> 1:19:38.980
 there's a book called Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman.

1:19:38.980 --> 1:19:42.140
 There's a series of books that starts with Surely You're

1:19:42.140 --> 1:19:43.180
 Joking, Mr. Feynman.

1:19:43.180 --> 1:19:45.760
 And I think the second one may be something like What Do You

1:19:45.760 --> 1:19:47.260
 Care What They Say or something.

1:19:47.260 --> 1:19:49.620
 I mean, the titles are all, there are three of them.

1:19:49.620 --> 1:19:53.820
 When I read those books, I was amazed at how accurately

1:19:53.820 --> 1:19:57.180
 those books portrayed the man that I interacted with.

1:19:57.180 --> 1:20:01.620
 He was irreverent, he was fun, he was deeply intelligent,

1:20:01.620 --> 1:20:03.620
 he was deeply human.

1:20:03.620 --> 1:20:07.300
 And those books tell that story very effectively.

1:20:07.300 --> 1:20:09.540
 Even just those moments, how did they

1:20:09.540 --> 1:20:12.100
 affect you as a physicist?

1:20:12.100 --> 1:20:15.380
 Well, one of the, well, it's funny because one

1:20:15.380 --> 1:20:20.460
 of the things that, I didn't hear Feynman say this,

1:20:20.460 --> 1:20:25.580
 but one of the things that is reported that he said

1:20:25.580 --> 1:20:29.600
 is if you're in a bar stool as a physicist,

1:20:29.600 --> 1:20:31.740
 and you can't explain to the guy on the bar stool

1:20:31.740 --> 1:20:33.060
 next to you what you're doing, you

1:20:33.060 --> 1:20:35.660
 don't understand what you're doing.

1:20:35.660 --> 1:20:40.580
 And there's a lot of that that I think is correct,

1:20:40.580 --> 1:20:47.580
 that when you truly understand something as complicated

1:20:47.580 --> 1:20:53.700
 as string theory, when it's in its fully formed final

1:20:53.700 --> 1:20:55.620
 development, it should be something

1:20:55.620 --> 1:20:58.980
 you could tell to the person on the bar stool next to you.

1:20:58.980 --> 1:21:03.300
 And that's something that affects the way I do science,

1:21:03.300 --> 1:21:04.900
 quite frankly.

1:21:04.900 --> 1:21:08.180
 It also affects the way I talk to the public about science.

1:21:08.180 --> 1:21:11.460
 It's one of my mantras that I keep deeply,

1:21:11.460 --> 1:21:15.980
 and try to keep deeply before me when I appear in public fora

1:21:15.980 --> 1:21:20.020
 speaking about physics in particular and science

1:21:20.020 --> 1:21:21.060
 in general.

1:21:21.060 --> 1:21:22.460
 It's also something that Einstein

1:21:22.460 --> 1:21:23.580
 said in a different way.

1:21:23.580 --> 1:21:27.200
 He said he had these two different formulations.

1:21:27.200 --> 1:21:31.820
 One of them is when the answer is simple, it's God speaking.

1:21:31.820 --> 1:21:33.700
 And the other thing that he said was

1:21:33.700 --> 1:21:37.580
 that what he did in his work was simply

1:21:37.580 --> 1:21:40.620
 the distillation of common sense,

1:21:40.620 --> 1:21:43.620
 that you distill down to something.

1:21:43.620 --> 1:21:45.940
 And he also said you make things as simple as possible

1:21:45.940 --> 1:21:47.860
 but no simpler.

1:21:47.860 --> 1:21:50.820
 So all of those things, and certainly this attitude for me

1:21:50.820 --> 1:21:53.380
 first seeing this was exemplified

1:21:53.380 --> 1:21:55.260
 by being around Richard Feynman.

1:21:55.260 --> 1:21:56.900
 So in all your work, you're always

1:21:56.900 --> 1:21:59.220
 searching for the simplicity, for the simple, clear.

1:21:59.220 --> 1:22:00.140
 I am, ultimately.

1:22:00.140 --> 1:22:01.980
 Ultimately, I am.

1:22:01.980 --> 1:22:05.660
 You served President Barack Obama's Council of Advisors

1:22:05.660 --> 1:22:07.660
 in Science and Technology.

1:22:07.660 --> 1:22:08.700
 For seven years, yes.

1:22:08.700 --> 1:22:11.260
 For seven years with Eric Schmidt

1:22:11.260 --> 1:22:13.380
 and several other brilliant people?

1:22:13.380 --> 1:22:17.580
 Met Eric for the first time in 2009

1:22:17.580 --> 1:22:19.820
 when the council was called together.

1:22:19.820 --> 1:22:21.420
 Yeah, I've seen pictures of you in that room.

1:22:21.420 --> 1:22:23.020
 I mean, there's a bunch of brilliant people.

1:22:23.020 --> 1:22:24.420
 It kind of looks amazing.

1:22:24.420 --> 1:22:27.340
 What was that experience like, being called

1:22:27.340 --> 1:22:29.300
 upon that kind of service?

1:22:29.300 --> 1:22:31.580
 So let me go back to my father, first of all.

1:22:31.580 --> 1:22:34.020
 I earlier mentioned that my father served 27 years

1:22:34.020 --> 1:22:37.020
 in the US Army, starting in World War II.

1:22:37.020 --> 1:22:42.820
 He went off in 1942, 43 to fight against the fascists.

1:22:42.820 --> 1:22:45.380
 He was part of the supply corps that

1:22:45.380 --> 1:22:47.580
 supplied General Patton as the tanks rolled

1:22:47.580 --> 1:22:51.860
 across Western Europe, pushing back the forces of Nazism

1:22:51.860 --> 1:22:54.980
 to meet up with our Russian comrades

1:22:54.980 --> 1:22:59.620
 who were pushing the Nazis starting in Stalingrad.

1:22:59.620 --> 1:23:02.420
 And the Second World War is actually

1:23:02.420 --> 1:23:06.060
 a very interesting piece of history

1:23:06.060 --> 1:23:08.460
 to know from both sides.

1:23:08.460 --> 1:23:09.980
 Here in America, we typically don't.

1:23:09.980 --> 1:23:12.500
 But I've actually studied history as an adult.

1:23:12.500 --> 1:23:14.500
 So I actually know sort of the whole story.

1:23:14.500 --> 1:23:16.860
 And on the Russian side, we don't know the Americans.

1:23:16.860 --> 1:23:19.260
 We weren't taught the American side of the story.

1:23:19.260 --> 1:23:20.020
 I know.

1:23:20.020 --> 1:23:22.820
 I have many Russian friends, and we've

1:23:22.820 --> 1:23:24.420
 had this conversation on many occasions.

1:23:24.420 --> 1:23:25.140
 It's fascinating.

1:23:25.140 --> 1:23:27.260
 But you know, like General Zhukov, for example,

1:23:27.260 --> 1:23:28.620
 was something that you wouldn't know about,

1:23:28.620 --> 1:23:30.100
 but you might not know about a Patton.

1:23:30.100 --> 1:23:30.860
 But you're right.

1:23:30.860 --> 1:23:34.980
 So Georgy Zhukov or Rokossovsky, I mean,

1:23:34.980 --> 1:23:36.820
 there's a whole list of names that I've

1:23:36.820 --> 1:23:39.180
 learned in the last 15 or 20 years looking

1:23:39.180 --> 1:23:41.020
 at the Second World War.

1:23:41.020 --> 1:23:44.340
 So your father was in the midst of that,

1:23:44.340 --> 1:23:46.500
 probably one of the greatest wars in history.

1:23:46.500 --> 1:23:49.860
 In the history of our species.

1:23:49.860 --> 1:23:54.540
 And so the idea of service comes to me essentially

1:23:54.540 --> 1:23:57.660
 from that example.

1:23:57.660 --> 1:24:06.020
 So in 2009, when I first got a call from a Nobel laureate

1:24:06.020 --> 1:24:09.940
 actually in biology, Harold Varmus,

1:24:09.940 --> 1:24:13.660
 I was on my way to India, and I got this email message,

1:24:13.660 --> 1:24:15.580
 and he said he needed to talk to me.

1:24:15.580 --> 1:24:18.140
 And I said, OK, fine, we can talk.

1:24:18.140 --> 1:24:20.180
 Got back to States I didn't hear from him.

1:24:20.180 --> 1:24:22.300
 We went through several cycles of this, sending me a message,

1:24:22.300 --> 1:24:24.860
 I want to talk to you, and then him never contacting us.

1:24:24.860 --> 1:24:28.180
 Finally, I was on my way to give a physics presentation

1:24:28.180 --> 1:24:29.860
 at the University of Florida in Gainesville,

1:24:29.860 --> 1:24:34.700
 and Jess had stepped off a plane,

1:24:34.700 --> 1:24:37.180
 and my mobile phone went off, and it was Harold.

1:24:37.180 --> 1:24:40.460
 And so I said, Harold, why do you keep sending me messages

1:24:40.460 --> 1:24:43.180
 that you want to talk but you never call?

1:24:43.180 --> 1:24:45.380
 And he said, well, I'm sorry, things have been hectic

1:24:45.380 --> 1:24:47.340
 and da, da, da, da, da.

1:24:47.340 --> 1:24:51.020
 And then he said, if you were offered the opportunity

1:24:51.020 --> 1:24:55.180
 to serve on the US President's Council of Advisors

1:24:55.180 --> 1:24:59.420
 on Science and Technology, what would be your answer?

1:24:59.420 --> 1:25:02.500
 I was amused at the formulation of the question,

1:25:02.500 --> 1:25:06.060
 because it's clear there's a purpose of why the question is

1:25:06.060 --> 1:25:07.540
 asked that way.

1:25:07.540 --> 1:25:12.500
 But then he made it clear to me he wasn't joking.

1:25:12.500 --> 1:25:15.220
 And literally, one of the few times in my life,

1:25:15.220 --> 1:25:19.020
 my knees went weak and I had to hold myself up

1:25:19.020 --> 1:25:21.340
 against a wall so that I didn't fall over.

1:25:23.100 --> 1:25:28.100
 I doubt if most of us who have been the beneficiaries

1:25:28.300 --> 1:25:29.940
 of the benefits of this country,

1:25:31.220 --> 1:25:34.900
 when given that kind of opportunity, could say no.

1:25:34.900 --> 1:25:37.820
 And I know I certainly couldn't say no.

1:25:37.820 --> 1:25:42.660
 I was frightened out of my wits because I had never,

1:25:43.700 --> 1:25:48.700
 although I have, my career in terms of policy recommendations

1:25:50.820 --> 1:25:52.620
 is actually quite long, it goes back to the 80s,

1:25:52.620 --> 1:25:57.620
 but I had never been called upon to serve as an advisor

1:25:57.620 --> 1:26:00.780
 to a president of the United States.

1:26:00.780 --> 1:26:05.780
 And it was very scary, but I did not feel that I could say no

1:26:06.780 --> 1:26:10.420
 because I wouldn't be able to sleep with myself at night

1:26:10.420 --> 1:26:13.740
 saying that I chickened out or whatever.

1:26:14.740 --> 1:26:19.180
 And so I took the plunge and we had a pretty good run.

1:26:19.180 --> 1:26:23.180
 There are things that I did in those seven years

1:26:23.180 --> 1:26:28.380
 of which I'm extraordinarily proud.

1:26:28.380 --> 1:26:30.660
 One of the ways I tell people is if you've ever seen

1:26:30.660 --> 1:26:34.100
 that television cartoon called Schoolhouse Rock,

1:26:34.100 --> 1:26:37.140
 there's this one story about how a bill becomes a law.

1:26:37.140 --> 1:26:38.540
 And I've kind of lived that.

1:26:38.540 --> 1:26:41.060
 There are things that I did

1:26:41.060 --> 1:26:43.620
 that have now been codified in US law.

1:26:44.620 --> 1:26:47.820
 Not everybody gets a chance to do things like that in life.

1:26:47.820 --> 1:26:50.660
 What do you think is the, science and technology,

1:26:50.660 --> 1:26:53.780
 especially in American politics,

1:26:53.780 --> 1:26:58.300
 we haven't had a president who's an engineer or a scientist.

1:26:58.300 --> 1:27:01.660
 What do you think is the role of a president like President Obama

1:27:01.660 --> 1:27:05.500
 in understanding the latest ideas in science and tech?

1:27:05.500 --> 1:27:06.820
 What was that experience like?

1:27:06.820 --> 1:27:09.660
 Well, first of all, I've met other presidents

1:27:09.660 --> 1:27:10.820
 beside President Obama.

1:27:10.820 --> 1:27:12.740
 He is the most extraordinary president

1:27:12.740 --> 1:27:15.220
 that I've ever encountered.

1:27:15.220 --> 1:27:18.180
 Despite the fact that he went to Harvard.

1:27:18.180 --> 1:27:21.300
 When I think about President Obama,

1:27:21.300 --> 1:27:23.540
 he is a deep mystery to me.

1:27:23.540 --> 1:27:27.180
 In the same way perhaps that the universe is a mystery.

1:27:27.180 --> 1:27:29.780
 I don't really understand how that constellation

1:27:29.780 --> 1:27:34.020
 of personality traits could come to fit

1:27:34.020 --> 1:27:35.700
 within a single individual.

1:27:35.700 --> 1:27:38.060
 But I saw them for seven years.

1:27:38.060 --> 1:27:41.140
 So I'm convinced that I wasn't seeing fake news.

1:27:41.140 --> 1:27:42.620
 I was seeing real data.

1:27:42.620 --> 1:27:44.780
 He was just an extraordinary man.

1:27:44.780 --> 1:27:48.620
 And one of the things that was completely clear

1:27:48.620 --> 1:27:55.620
 was that he was not afraid and not intimidated

1:27:55.620 --> 1:27:58.260
 to be in a room of really smart people.

1:27:58.260 --> 1:28:00.900
 I mean, really smart people.

1:28:00.900 --> 1:28:06.380
 That he was completely comfortable in asking

1:28:06.380 --> 1:28:07.940
 some of the world's greatest experts,

1:28:07.940 --> 1:28:09.860
 what do I do about this problem?

1:28:09.860 --> 1:28:12.500
 And it wasn't that he was going to just take the problem

1:28:12.500 --> 1:28:15.460
 and it wasn't that he was going to just take their answer,

1:28:15.460 --> 1:28:18.340
 but he would listen to the advice.

1:28:18.340 --> 1:28:21.060
 And that to me was extraordinary.

1:28:21.060 --> 1:28:23.020
 As I said, I've been around other executives

1:28:23.020 --> 1:28:27.020
 and I've never seen one quite like him.

1:28:27.020 --> 1:28:30.260
 He's an extraordinary learner, is what I observed.

1:28:30.260 --> 1:28:32.940
 And not just about science.

1:28:32.940 --> 1:28:36.700
 He has a way of internalizing information in real time

1:28:36.700 --> 1:28:39.100
 that I've never seen in a politician before.

1:28:39.100 --> 1:28:42.460
 Even in extraordinarily complicated situations.

1:28:42.460 --> 1:28:43.700
 Even scientific ideas.

1:28:43.700 --> 1:28:45.060
 Scientific or non scientific.

1:28:45.060 --> 1:28:47.900
 Complicated ideas don't have to be scientific ideas.

1:28:47.900 --> 1:28:50.100
 But I have, like I said, seen him in real time

1:28:50.100 --> 1:28:54.060
 process complicated ideas with a speed that was stunning.

1:28:54.060 --> 1:28:56.340
 In fact, he shocked the entire council.

1:28:56.340 --> 1:29:01.260
 I mean, we were all stunned at his capacity

1:29:01.260 --> 1:29:06.180
 to be presented with complicated ideas

1:29:06.180 --> 1:29:08.580
 and then to wrestle with them and internalize them.

1:29:08.580 --> 1:29:11.380
 And then come back, more interestingly enough,

1:29:11.380 --> 1:29:14.020
 come back with really good questions to ask.

1:29:14.020 --> 1:29:17.140
 I've noticed this in an area that I understand more

1:29:17.140 --> 1:29:19.220
 of artificial intelligence.

1:29:19.220 --> 1:29:21.740
 I've seen him integrate information

1:29:21.740 --> 1:29:24.100
 about artificial intelligence and then come out

1:29:24.100 --> 1:29:27.340
 with these kind of Richard Feynman like insights.

1:29:27.340 --> 1:29:28.260
 That's exactly right.

1:29:28.260 --> 1:29:32.380
 And as I said, those of us who have been in that position,

1:29:32.380 --> 1:29:35.940
 it is stunning to see it happen because you don't expect it.

1:29:35.940 --> 1:29:40.180
 Yeah, he takes what, for a lot of sort of graduate students,

1:29:40.180 --> 1:29:42.220
 takes like four years in a particular topic

1:29:42.220 --> 1:29:43.900
 and he just does it in a few minutes.

1:29:43.900 --> 1:29:46.380
 He sees it very naturally.

1:29:46.380 --> 1:29:47.780
 You've mentioned that you would love

1:29:47.780 --> 1:29:51.820
 to see experimental validation of super strength theory

1:29:51.820 --> 1:29:53.060
 before you shove.

1:29:53.060 --> 1:29:56.260
 Before I shuffle off this mortal coil.

1:29:56.260 --> 1:29:58.180
 Which the poetry of that reference

1:29:58.180 --> 1:30:00.380
 made me smile when I saw it.

1:30:00.380 --> 1:30:02.180
 You know, people actually misunderstand it

1:30:02.180 --> 1:30:03.940
 because it's not what, it doesn't mean

1:30:03.940 --> 1:30:06.620
 what we generally take it to mean colloquially.

1:30:06.620 --> 1:30:08.300
 But it's such a beautiful expression.

1:30:08.300 --> 1:30:09.140
 Yeah, it is.

1:30:09.140 --> 1:30:13.780
 It's from the Hamlet, to be or not to be speech.

1:30:13.780 --> 1:30:15.460
 Which I still don't understand what that's about.

1:30:15.460 --> 1:30:18.620
 But so many interpretations.

1:30:18.620 --> 1:30:22.700
 Anyway, what are the most exciting problems in physics

1:30:22.700 --> 1:30:25.260
 that are just within our reach of understanding

1:30:25.260 --> 1:30:27.340
 and maybe solve the next few decades

1:30:27.340 --> 1:30:29.140
 that you may be able to see?

1:30:29.140 --> 1:30:32.780
 So in physics, you limited it to physics.

1:30:32.780 --> 1:30:36.380
 Physics, mathematics, this kind of space of problems

1:30:36.380 --> 1:30:37.500
 that fascinate you.

1:30:39.140 --> 1:30:41.660
 Well, the one that looks on the immediate horizon

1:30:41.660 --> 1:30:43.980
 like we're gonna get to is quantum computing.

1:30:45.340 --> 1:30:47.540
 And that's gonna, if we actually get there,

1:30:47.540 --> 1:30:50.540
 that's gonna be extraordinarily interesting.

1:30:50.540 --> 1:30:53.980
 Do you think that's a fundamentally problem of theory

1:30:53.980 --> 1:30:55.860
 or is it now in the space of engineering?

1:30:55.860 --> 1:30:57.020
 It's in the space of engineering.

1:30:57.020 --> 1:31:01.340
 I was out at a Q station, as you may know,

1:31:01.340 --> 1:31:06.340
 Microsoft has this research facility in Santa Barbara.

1:31:06.780 --> 1:31:09.740
 I was out there a couple of months in my capacity

1:31:09.740 --> 1:31:12.500
 as a vice president of American Physical Society.

1:31:12.500 --> 1:31:15.660
 And I had some things that were like lectures

1:31:15.660 --> 1:31:18.260
 and they were telling me what they were doing.

1:31:18.260 --> 1:31:20.380
 And it sure sounded like they knew what they were doing

1:31:20.380 --> 1:31:22.620
 and that they were close to major breakthroughs.

1:31:24.140 --> 1:31:26.420
 Yeah, that's a really exciting possibility there.

1:31:26.420 --> 1:31:31.420
 But back to Hamlet, do you ponder mortality,

1:31:31.460 --> 1:31:32.660
 your own mortality?

1:31:32.660 --> 1:31:35.940
 Nope, my mother died when I was 11 years old.

1:31:35.940 --> 1:31:40.940
 And so I immediately knew what the end of the story was

1:31:41.220 --> 1:31:42.580
 for all of us.

1:31:42.580 --> 1:31:45.660
 As a consequence, I've never spent a lot of time

1:31:45.660 --> 1:31:47.700
 thinking about death.

1:31:47.700 --> 1:31:49.940
 It'll come in its own good time.

1:31:49.940 --> 1:31:54.220
 And sort of to me, the job of every human

1:31:54.220 --> 1:31:56.460
 is to make the best and the most of the time

1:31:56.460 --> 1:32:01.460
 that's given to us in order not for our own selfish gain,

1:32:02.340 --> 1:32:04.780
 but to try to make this place a better place

1:32:04.780 --> 1:32:05.980
 for someone else.

1:32:08.740 --> 1:32:13.460
 And on the why of life, why do you think we are?

1:32:13.460 --> 1:32:16.380
 I have no idea and I never even worried about it.

1:32:17.460 --> 1:32:20.900
 For me, I have an answer, a local answer.

1:32:20.900 --> 1:32:22.460
 The apparent why for me was

1:32:22.460 --> 1:32:25.020
 because I'm supposed to do physics.

1:32:25.020 --> 1:32:28.140
 But it's funny because there's so many other

1:32:29.460 --> 1:32:32.300
 quantum mechanically speaking possibilities in your life,

1:32:33.220 --> 1:32:35.500
 such as being an astronaut, for example.

1:32:35.500 --> 1:32:36.980
 So you know about that, I see.

1:32:36.980 --> 1:32:41.980
 Well, like Einstein and the vicissitudes

1:32:45.740 --> 1:32:50.740
 that prevented the 1914 measurement of starlight vending,

1:32:50.740 --> 1:32:53.740
 the universe is constructed in such a way

1:32:53.740 --> 1:32:56.020
 that I didn't become an astronaut, which would have,

1:32:56.020 --> 1:33:00.020
 for me, I would have faced the worst choice in my life,

1:33:00.020 --> 1:33:04.540
 whether I would try to become an astronaut

1:33:04.540 --> 1:33:07.420
 or whether I would try to do theoretical physics.

1:33:07.420 --> 1:33:09.140
 Both of these dreams were born

1:33:09.140 --> 1:33:11.660
 when I was four years old simultaneously.

1:33:11.660 --> 1:33:14.700
 And so I can't imagine how difficult

1:33:14.700 --> 1:33:16.980
 that decision would have been.

1:33:16.980 --> 1:33:19.540
 The universe helped you out on that one.

1:33:19.540 --> 1:33:21.780
 Not only in that one, but in many ones.

1:33:21.780 --> 1:33:25.380
 It helped me out by allowing me to pick the right dad.

1:33:25.380 --> 1:33:27.900
 Is there a day in your life you could relive

1:33:27.900 --> 1:33:29.740
 because it made you truly happy?

1:33:29.740 --> 1:33:32.700
 What day would that be if you could just look back?

1:33:32.700 --> 1:33:35.460
 Being a theoretical physicist

1:33:35.460 --> 1:33:37.460
 is like having Christmas every day.

1:33:39.020 --> 1:33:40.780
 I have lots of joy in my life.

1:33:43.180 --> 1:33:46.940
 The moments of invention, the moments of ideas, revelation.

1:33:46.940 --> 1:33:49.900
 Yes, the only thing that exceed them are

1:33:49.900 --> 1:33:53.060
 some family experiences like when my kids were born

1:33:53.060 --> 1:33:56.860
 and that kind of stuff, but they're pretty high up there.

1:33:57.900 --> 1:34:00.540
 Well, I don't see a better way to end it, Jim.

1:34:00.540 --> 1:34:01.380
 Thank you so much.

1:34:01.380 --> 1:34:03.300
 It was a huge honor talking to you today.

1:34:03.300 --> 1:34:05.340
 This worked out better than I thought.

1:34:05.340 --> 1:34:35.100
 I'm glad to hear it.

1:34:35.540 --> 1:34:38.300
 And now, let me leave you with some words of wisdom

1:34:38.300 --> 1:34:42.780
 from the great Albert Einstein for the rebels among us.

1:34:42.780 --> 1:34:45.020
 Unthinking respect for authority

1:34:45.020 --> 1:34:48.140
 is the greatest enemy of truth.

1:34:48.140 --> 1:35:07.140
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
