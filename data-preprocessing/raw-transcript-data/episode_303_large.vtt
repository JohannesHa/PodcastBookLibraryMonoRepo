00:00.000 --> 00:04.920
 The real foundation of Marx's political philosophy was the economic argument that there would

00:04.920 --> 00:10.580
 be a tendency for the rate of profit to fall, and that tendency for the rate of profit to

00:10.580 --> 00:17.760
 fall would lead to capitalists battening down on workers harder, paying them less than their

00:17.760 --> 00:23.000
 subsistence, a revolt by workers against this, and then you would get socialism on

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
 the other side.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.520
 So what he called the tendency for the rate of profit to fall played a critical role in

00:29.520 --> 00:32.680
 his explanation of why socialism would have to come about.

00:32.680 --> 00:37.760
 If you look at Marx's own vision of the revolution, it was going to happen in England.

00:37.760 --> 00:41.240
 The advanced economies would be first to go through the revolution.

00:41.240 --> 00:45.760
 The socialist, the primitive economies would have to go through a capitalist transition,

00:45.760 --> 00:49.080
 and this is the difference between the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks.

00:49.080 --> 00:53.120
 So the Mensheviks, when Hyman Minsky came out of the Menshevik family, the Mensheviks

00:53.120 --> 00:55.600
 believed you had to go through a capitalist phase.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.940
 Russia had to go through a capitalist period before it becomes socialist.

00:58.940 --> 01:03.680
 The Bolsheviks believed they could get there in one go.

01:03.680 --> 01:08.040
 The following is a conversation with Steve Keen, a brilliant economist that criticizes

01:08.040 --> 01:13.520
 much of modern economics and proposes new theories and models that integrate some ideas

01:13.520 --> 01:19.160
 and ditch others from very thinkers, from Karl Marx to John Maynard Keynes to Hyman

01:19.160 --> 01:20.160
 Minsky.

01:20.160 --> 01:25.940
 In fact, a lot of our conversation is about Karl Marx and Marxian economics.

01:25.940 --> 01:32.160
 He has been a scholar of Karl Marx's work for many years, so this was a fascinating

01:32.160 --> 01:33.160
 exploration.

01:33.160 --> 01:38.160
 He has written several books I recommend, including The New Economics and Manifesto

01:38.160 --> 01:41.820
 and Debunking Economics.

01:41.820 --> 01:43.680
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

01:43.680 --> 01:47.360
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:47.360 --> 01:51.640
 And now, dear friends, here's Steve Keen.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.600
 Let's start with a big question.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.880
 What is economics?

01:55.880 --> 01:59.560
 Or maybe what is or should be the goal of economics?

01:59.560 --> 02:03.400
 Well, it should be I understand how human civilization comes about and how it can be

02:03.400 --> 02:05.720
 maintained.

02:05.720 --> 02:08.160
 And that's not what it's been at all.

02:08.160 --> 02:12.360
 So we have a discipline which has the right name and the wrong soul.

02:12.360 --> 02:13.680
 What is the soul of economics?

02:13.680 --> 02:20.400
 The soul of economics really is to explain how do we manage to build a civilization that

02:20.400 --> 02:30.280
 elevates us so far above the energy and consumption and knowledge levels of the base environment

02:30.280 --> 02:31.280
 of the Earth?

02:31.280 --> 02:35.600
 Because if you think about—and this is actually work I've learned from Tim Garrett, who's

02:35.600 --> 02:41.480
 one of my research colleagues who's an atmospheric physicist—and his idea is that we exploit

02:41.480 --> 02:47.920
 these high grade energy sources from the sun itself to coal, nuclear, et cetera, et cetera,

02:47.920 --> 02:51.960
 which means we can maintain a level of human civilization well above what we'd have if

02:51.960 --> 02:55.400
 we were just still running around with rocks and stones and spears.

02:55.400 --> 03:02.040
 So it's that elevation above the base level of the planet, which is human civilization.

03:02.040 --> 03:06.480
 And if we didn't have this energy we were exploiting, if we didn't use the environment

03:06.480 --> 03:10.840
 to elevate ourselves above what's possible in the background, then you and I wouldn't

03:10.840 --> 03:13.360
 be talking into microphones.

03:13.360 --> 03:17.140
 We might be doing drumbeats and stuff like this, but we wouldn't be having the sort

03:17.140 --> 03:18.680
 of conversation we have.

03:18.680 --> 03:22.480
 So to explain how that came about, that's what the economics should be doing, and it's

03:22.480 --> 03:23.480
 not.

03:23.480 --> 03:26.280
 So this is the greatest thing that the Earth has ever created, is what you're saying,

03:26.280 --> 03:27.280
 this conversation?

03:27.280 --> 03:31.040
 Yeah, we're the most elaborate construction on the planet.

03:31.040 --> 03:34.680
 And that's not what we've done, we've denigrated the planet itself.

03:34.680 --> 03:38.560
 We don't have respect for the fact that life itself is an incredible creation.

03:38.560 --> 03:43.600
 And my ultimate—if I had to see how humanity is going to survive what we're putting ourselves

03:43.600 --> 03:49.360
 through, then we'd have to come out of it as a species which sees its role as preserving

03:49.360 --> 03:51.360
 and respecting life.

03:51.360 --> 04:00.840
 I like how you took my silly, incredible statement and made it into a serious one about how amazing

04:00.840 --> 04:02.000
 life is.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.440
 Life is incredible, and we humans don't respect it enough, we trash it.

04:07.440 --> 04:10.500
 And that's what economics, I think, has played a huge role in that.

04:10.500 --> 04:15.420
 Until I actually regard my discipline, I would never call it a profession, let alone a science.

04:15.420 --> 04:22.780
 My discipline has probably helped bring about the termination potential, the feasible termination

04:22.780 --> 04:23.780
 of human civilization.

04:23.780 --> 04:24.780
 Strong words.

04:24.780 --> 04:28.040
 Okay, let's return to the basics of economics.

04:28.040 --> 04:33.200
 So what is the soul and the practice of economics?

04:33.200 --> 04:34.600
 What should be the goal of it?

04:34.600 --> 04:41.520
 Because you're speaking very poetically, but we'll also speak pragmatically about the tools

04:41.520 --> 04:47.280
 of economics, the variables of economics, the metrics, the goals, the models.

04:47.280 --> 04:50.200
 Practically speaking, what are the goals of economics?

04:50.200 --> 04:55.940
 Well, in terms of the tools we use, we should be using the tools that engineers use, frankly.

04:55.940 --> 05:01.000
 And that sounds ridiculously simple, because you would expect that economists are using

05:01.000 --> 05:06.800
 up to date techniques that are common in other sciences, where you're dealing with similar

05:06.800 --> 05:11.880
 ideas of stocks and flows, and interactions between the environment and a system and so

05:11.880 --> 05:12.880
 on.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.080
 And that's fundamentally systems engineering.

05:15.080 --> 05:18.080
 And that's what we should be using as the tools of economics.

05:18.080 --> 05:22.440
 Now if you look at what economists actually do, the sophisticated stuff involves difference

05:22.440 --> 05:25.160
 equations.

05:25.160 --> 05:29.160
 And like difference equations, you know, if you've done enough mathematics as you have,

05:29.160 --> 05:33.400
 you know, difference equations are useful for like individual level processes.

05:33.400 --> 05:38.600
 If you're talking about autonomous, it'll go from state t to t plus one, t plus two,

05:38.600 --> 05:39.600
 and so on.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.400
 But not when you're talking at the aggregate level.

05:41.400 --> 05:44.680
 There you use differential equations to measure it all.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.600
 Economists have been using difference equations.

05:46.600 --> 05:51.200
 So there's like a book, I think it's by Sargent and one other, called Advanced Methods in

05:51.200 --> 05:54.760
 Economics Using Python, two volumes set.

05:54.760 --> 06:00.760
 It's about close to 2,000 pages, and four of those pages are on differential equations.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.060
 The rest is all difference equations.

06:03.060 --> 06:05.920
 So they're using entirely the wrong mathematics to start with.

06:05.920 --> 06:10.000
 For people listening, what is difference equations versus differential equations?

06:10.000 --> 06:12.600
 Difference equation is like you can do in a spreadsheet.

06:12.600 --> 06:18.360
 You'll have, this is the value for 1990, this is the value for 1991, 92, 93, 94.

06:18.360 --> 06:23.800
 So you have discrete jumps in time, whereas the differential equation says there's a process

06:23.800 --> 06:25.800
 moving through time.

06:25.800 --> 06:32.600
 And you will have a rate of change of a variable is a function of the state of itself and other

06:32.600 --> 06:35.780
 variables and rates of change of those variables.

06:35.780 --> 06:38.440
 And that is what you use when you're doing an aggregate model.

06:38.440 --> 06:42.880
 So if you're modeling water, for example, or fluid dynamics, you have a set of differential

06:42.880 --> 06:47.520
 equations describing the entire body of fluid moving through time.

06:47.520 --> 06:52.440
 You don't try to model the discrete motion of each molecule of H2O.

06:52.440 --> 06:56.360
 So at the aggregate level, you use differential equations for processes that occur through

06:56.360 --> 06:57.520
 time.

06:57.520 --> 06:58.520
 And that's economics.

06:58.520 --> 06:59.960
 It occurs through time.

06:59.960 --> 07:02.380
 You should be using that particular technology.

07:02.380 --> 07:07.240
 But some economists do learn differential equations, but they don't learn stability

07:07.240 --> 07:08.240
 analysis.

07:08.240 --> 07:12.280
 So they simply assume equilibrium is stable, and they work in equilibrium terms all the

07:12.280 --> 07:13.280
 time.

07:13.280 --> 07:22.400
 And the technical level, it's an incredibly complicated way of modeling the world using

07:22.400 --> 07:23.960
 entirely the wrong tools.

07:23.960 --> 07:29.640
 OK, we'll talk about that because it's unclear what the right tools are.

07:29.640 --> 07:33.520
 Maybe it's more clear to you, but I've got to make it clear to an audience.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.720
 Well, so this is a very complicated world.

07:36.720 --> 07:37.920
 It's a complex world.

07:37.920 --> 07:46.920
 You talk about there are some of the most complex systems on Earth are the human mind,

07:46.920 --> 07:49.600
 the economy and the biosphere.

07:49.600 --> 07:53.920
 So we'll go, you know, we'll go to that place.

07:53.920 --> 07:56.440
 I'm fascinated by complex systems.

07:56.440 --> 08:03.080
 I'm humbled by them, even at their simplest level of like cellular automata.

08:03.080 --> 08:11.120
 I'm not sure what the right tools are to understand that, especially when part of the complex

08:11.120 --> 08:13.600
 system is like a hierarchy of other complex systems.

08:13.600 --> 08:20.060
 So you said the economy is a fascinating complex system, but it's made up of human minds.

08:20.060 --> 08:21.920
 And those are interesting.

08:21.920 --> 08:26.680
 Those are interesting, perhaps impossible to model, but we can try and we can try to

08:26.680 --> 08:28.160
 figure out how to approximate them.

08:28.160 --> 08:30.200
 And maybe that's the challenge of economics.

08:30.200 --> 08:33.140
 OK, we'll keep returning to the basics.

08:33.140 --> 08:36.360
 Let us try to learn something from history.

08:36.360 --> 08:40.600
 I also see as part of economics is us trying to figure out stuff.

08:40.600 --> 08:46.360
 And there's a few smart folks that write books throughout human history.

08:46.360 --> 08:50.640
 And sometimes they name schools of economics after them.

08:50.640 --> 08:54.560
 So let us take a stroll through history.

08:54.560 --> 08:55.560
 OK.

08:55.560 --> 09:02.500
 Can you describe at a high level what are the different schools of economics, perhaps

09:02.500 --> 09:09.080
 ones that are interesting to you, perhaps ones that the difference between which reveals

09:09.080 --> 09:14.080
 something useful or insightful for our conversation.

09:14.080 --> 09:22.400
 So you know, you could neoclassical, post Keynesian, Austrian, like the biophysical

09:22.400 --> 09:26.760
 economics and so on, other heterodox economic schools that you find interesting.

09:26.760 --> 09:32.080
 OK, I actually find interesting a school which went extinct about 250 years ago.

09:32.080 --> 09:33.440
 That's where I'd like to start from.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.720
 And they're called the Physiocrats.

09:35.720 --> 09:41.080
 And the name itself implies where the knowledge came from, because if you go back far enough

09:41.080 --> 09:43.760
 in history, we didn't do autopsies.

09:43.760 --> 09:49.480
 But when you started doing autopsies, they found wires, they found tubes, etc., etc.

09:49.480 --> 09:53.280
 And they started seeing the body as a circulation system, and they applied the same sort of

09:53.280 --> 09:55.300
 logic to the economy.

09:55.300 --> 10:00.880
 And they came out of an agricultural economy, which was France, and they saw that the wealth

10:00.880 --> 10:03.140
 came effectively from the sun.

10:03.140 --> 10:06.940
 So their soil wealth comes from, like I said, the soil, but what they really mean is sun.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.200
 The soil absorbs the energy of the sun.

10:09.200 --> 10:12.100
 One seed plants, a thousand flea seeds come back.

10:12.100 --> 10:13.880
 There is no surplus.

10:13.880 --> 10:17.600
 We are simply mining what we can find out of the natural economy.

10:17.600 --> 10:20.820
 That's where we should have stayed and developed from that forward.

10:20.820 --> 10:24.920
 We then went through the classical school of economics, which comes out of Adam Smith.

10:24.920 --> 10:31.720
 And Smith, coming from Scotland, looked at what the Physiocrats said, and what the Physiocrats

10:31.720 --> 10:35.920
 argued was that agriculture is the source of all wealth, and the manufacturing sector

10:35.920 --> 10:37.240
 is sterile.

10:37.240 --> 10:39.800
 That's literally the term they used to describe the manufacturing sector.

10:39.800 --> 10:40.800
 What does sterile mean?

10:40.800 --> 10:43.920
 Sterile means you don't extract value.

10:43.920 --> 10:46.200
 You simply change the shape of value.

10:46.200 --> 10:49.120
 So the value comes from the soil.

10:49.120 --> 10:51.000
 Yeah, it comes from the soil.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.520
 That's the free gift of nature.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.400
 That's literally the phrase they used.

10:54.400 --> 10:59.300
 And we then distribute the free gift of nature around, and we need carriages, which was the

10:59.300 --> 11:04.360
 manufacturing term they used at the time, as well as wheat.

11:04.360 --> 11:09.400
 So to make the carriages, we take what's been taken from the soil, and we convert it to

11:09.400 --> 11:10.400
 a different form.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.040
 But there is no value added in manufacturing.

11:13.040 --> 11:16.600
 So Smith looked at that and said, well, I'm from Scotland.

11:16.600 --> 11:21.640
 And we've got these industries, and we make stuff, and it's machinery.

11:21.640 --> 11:26.320
 And he said, no, it's not land that gives us the source of value, it's labor.

11:26.320 --> 11:33.080
 Now, that led to the classical school of thought, and that said that all value comes from labor,

11:33.080 --> 11:38.820
 that value is objective, so it's the amount of effort you put in, that the price two things

11:38.820 --> 11:42.920
 will exchange for reflects the relative effort that's involved in the manufacturing.

11:42.920 --> 11:47.120
 So this computer takes two hours to make, and this bottle takes two minutes to make,

11:47.120 --> 11:50.520
 then this is worth 60 times as much as that.

11:50.520 --> 11:53.620
 They didn't talk about marginal cost.

11:53.620 --> 11:55.560
 It was absolute cost, effectively.

11:55.560 --> 12:01.940
 They didn't talk about utility as a subjective thing, they ridiculed subjective utility theory.

12:01.940 --> 12:07.400
 That led to Marx, and Marx is probably the most brilliant mind in the history of economics.

12:07.400 --> 12:12.160
 The only other competitor I'd see is Schumpeter, possibly Keynes, but in my terms of ranking

12:12.160 --> 12:17.600
 of intellects, it would be Marx, Schumpeter, Keynes, in terms of the outstanding capacities

12:17.600 --> 12:18.680
 to think.

12:18.680 --> 12:24.800
 But Marx then turned that classical school, which was pro capitalism and anti feudal,

12:24.800 --> 12:29.360
 into a critique of capitalism, which led to the neoclassical school coming along as a

12:29.360 --> 12:31.320
 defense of capitalism.

12:31.320 --> 12:36.520
 But they defended it using the ideas of the subjective theory of value, so that value

12:36.520 --> 12:42.580
 does not reflect effort, it's the satisfaction individuals get from different objects that

12:42.580 --> 12:45.760
 determines their value, marginal utility.

12:45.760 --> 12:50.040
 It's the marginal cost that determines how much they sell for.

12:50.040 --> 12:56.320
 Capitalism equilibrates marginal cost and marginal utility, and the concepts of equilibrium

12:56.320 --> 13:00.640
 and marginal this and marginal that became the neoclassical school, and that's still

13:00.640 --> 13:04.200
 the dominant school now 150 years later.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.680
 That's the one that everybody learns.

13:05.680 --> 13:09.000
 When you first learn economics, if you don't have the critical background that I managed

13:09.000 --> 13:15.800
 to acquire, that's what you think is economics, the marginal utility, equilibrium oriented

13:15.800 --> 13:20.560
 analysis of mainstream economics, and for example, they ignore money.

13:20.560 --> 13:23.680
 People think economists, you must be an expert on money because you're an economist.

13:23.680 --> 13:27.720
 Well, in fact, economists learn literally in the first few weeks at university that

13:27.720 --> 13:29.520
 money is irrelevant.

13:29.520 --> 13:31.960
 They say money illusion.

13:31.960 --> 13:37.040
 They represent people's tastes using what they call indifference curves, and they're

13:37.040 --> 13:39.240
 like isoquants on a weather map.

13:39.240 --> 13:43.020
 If you look at an isoquant, it shows you all the points of the same pressure.

13:43.020 --> 13:47.520
 So you can be here or you can be in Denver and the air pressure can be the same if you're

13:47.520 --> 13:50.640
 in the same weather unit, so you just draw a cell that links together.

13:50.640 --> 13:55.080
 Well, they do the same thing with utility and say lots of bananas and very few coconuts

13:55.080 --> 14:01.320
 can give you the same utility as lots of coconuts and very few bananas, and you draw basically

14:01.320 --> 14:06.660
 like a hyperbola running down linking the two, and they'll say, well, that's your utility.

14:06.660 --> 14:10.960
 That describes your tastes, and then we have your income, and given your income, you can

14:10.960 --> 14:16.800
 buy that many bananas completely or that many coconuts or a straight line combination of

14:16.800 --> 14:22.320
 the two, and then if we double the nominal price of coconuts and double the nominal price

14:22.320 --> 14:27.920
 of bananas and double your income, what happens, and the correct answer is, oh, nothing, sir.

14:27.920 --> 14:34.120
 You stay at the same point of tangency between what your budget is and which particular utility

14:34.120 --> 14:36.980
 curve gives you the maximum satisfaction.

14:36.980 --> 14:40.100
 So that gets ingrained into them, and they think anybody who worries about money suffers

14:40.100 --> 14:42.480
 from money illusion.

14:42.480 --> 14:48.140
 You are therefore ignorant of the deep insights of economics if you think money actually matters.

14:48.140 --> 14:53.880
 So you have an entire theory of economics which presumes we exchange through barter.

14:53.880 --> 14:58.280
 Like I'll swap you that Microsoft Surface for, actually, I'll take two of those for

14:58.280 --> 14:59.280
 one of these.

14:59.280 --> 15:02.040
 We do this bartering type arrangement.

15:02.040 --> 15:08.160
 In fact, that only works if money plays no creative role in the economy, and that's where

15:08.160 --> 15:13.080
 you find, reading Schumpeter, the insight that's the school of thought that I come from

15:13.080 --> 15:15.260
 that says money is essential.

15:15.260 --> 15:19.140
 Money actually adds to demand, and we'll talk about that later on.

15:19.140 --> 15:28.440
 So that's the neoclassical school that ends up being subjective theory of value, nonmonetary,

15:28.440 --> 15:33.580
 as though everything happens in barter, and focusing on equilibrium, as though everything

15:33.580 --> 15:38.120
 happens in equilibrium, or if you get disturbed from equilibrium, you return back to it again.

15:38.120 --> 15:42.760
 And that mindset describes capitalism.

15:42.760 --> 15:46.040
 Its most interesting feature is that it reaches equilibrium.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.640
 Now what planet are we on to believe that?

15:48.640 --> 15:54.080
 Because if you look at the real world, the real exciting world of capitalism in which

15:54.080 --> 15:59.400
 we live, change is by far the most obvious characteristic of it.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.800
 There's no equilibrium.

16:00.800 --> 16:01.800
 There's no equilibrium.

16:01.800 --> 16:02.800
 It's unstable.

16:02.800 --> 16:07.800
 And as a mathematician, it's easy to – you work with stability analysis.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.600
 You work out what the Jacobian is.

16:10.600 --> 16:13.920
 You work out your Lyapunov exponents in a complex system.

16:13.920 --> 16:17.160
 You're used to the idea that equilibrium is unstable.

16:17.160 --> 16:21.480
 But economists get schooled into believing that everything happens in equilibrium, and

16:21.480 --> 16:23.360
 they don't learn stability analysis.

16:23.360 --> 16:25.240
 So all that stuff is missing.

16:25.240 --> 16:32.360
 So onto the schools of thought, treating the economy as an equilibrium system, which was

16:32.360 --> 16:36.800
 what the neoclassical school did, is what Keynes disturbed.

16:36.800 --> 16:41.660
 And he really disturbed it by talking about, fundamentally, that uncertainty determines

16:41.660 --> 16:43.600
 our decisions about the future.

16:43.600 --> 16:49.800
 So when we consume, you know if you like Pfizer or whatever particular drink we want to have,

16:49.800 --> 16:51.960
 you know the current situation.

16:51.960 --> 16:55.120
 But to invest, you must be making guesses about the future.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.700
 But you don't know the future.

16:56.700 --> 16:57.740
 So what do you do?

16:57.740 --> 17:00.460
 You extrapolate what you currently know.

17:00.460 --> 17:05.420
 And as you said, this is a terrible basis on which to plan for the future.

17:05.420 --> 17:10.760
 But this is the only thing you can do where there is no possibility of solid calculation.

17:10.760 --> 17:16.880
 So investment is therefore subject to uncertainty, and therefore you will get volatility out

17:16.880 --> 17:17.880
 of investment.

17:17.880 --> 17:22.800
 You will get fads, of course, booms and slumps coming out of that, because people extrapolate

17:22.800 --> 17:24.640
 for the current conditions.

17:24.640 --> 17:27.360
 And that's the normal state of a capitalist economy.

17:27.360 --> 17:32.600
 And Schumpeter argued that that's what gives it its creativity as well, the fact that you

17:32.600 --> 17:37.160
 can perceive a potential demand, but first of all, you don't know whether that demand

17:37.160 --> 17:38.160
 is going to work.

17:38.160 --> 17:41.120
 Secondly, you don't know who your competitor is going to be, whether somebody is going

17:41.120 --> 17:42.760
 to be ahead of you or behind.

17:42.760 --> 17:46.720
 If there's a fad, you'll overinvest.

17:46.720 --> 17:50.440
 All this stuff is the real nature of capitalism, and that's what we're trying to capture,

17:50.440 --> 17:57.080
 the dynamic nonequilibrium monetary violence and creativity of capitalism.

17:57.080 --> 17:58.800
 That's what we should be analyzing.

17:58.800 --> 18:03.800
 And the post Keynesian school has gone in that orientation.

18:03.800 --> 18:09.280
 They've been, in my opinion, inhibited by learning their mathematics from neoclassical

18:09.280 --> 18:12.840
 economists, so they don't have enough of the technology of complex systems.

18:12.840 --> 18:17.680
 There's only a really tiny handful of people working in complex systems analysis in post

18:17.680 --> 18:21.040
 Keynesian economics, but that is, to me, the most interesting area.

18:21.040 --> 18:26.160
 So their tools may be lacking, but they fundamentally accept the instability of things.

18:26.160 --> 18:27.160
 That's right.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.160
 That's right.

18:28.160 --> 18:29.160
 That's interesting.

18:29.160 --> 18:32.520
 So let me try to summarize what you said, and then you say how stupid I am.

18:32.520 --> 18:33.520
 Okay.

18:33.520 --> 18:40.920
 So then there was the physiocrats that thought value came from the land.

18:40.920 --> 18:50.440
 Then there's Adam Smith, who said, nah, value comes from human labor.

18:50.440 --> 18:52.640
 That was the classical school.

18:52.640 --> 19:01.640
 And then neoclassical is value comes from bananas and coconuts, human preferences, like

19:01.640 --> 19:06.320
 human happiness, how happy a banana makes you.

19:06.320 --> 19:13.480
 And then the Keynesian and the post Keynesian were like, yeah, well, you can't, you can

19:13.480 --> 19:19.040
 never, the moment you try to put value to a banana and a coconut, you're already working

19:19.040 --> 19:21.800
 in the past.

19:21.800 --> 19:24.280
 It's always going to be chaos and stability.

19:24.280 --> 19:29.020
 And then you just, you're fishing in uncertain waters, and that's why we have to embrace

19:29.020 --> 19:32.780
 that and come up with tools that model that well.

19:32.780 --> 19:36.840
 And also Joseph Schumpeter, what school would you put him under?

19:36.840 --> 19:41.000
 Is he a Keynesian or is he Austrian economics?

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
 He's an Austrian.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
 The Austrians deny.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
 Okay.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
 That's the intriguing.

19:45.000 --> 19:51.080
 He's from Austria, but he's not an Austrian economist.

19:51.080 --> 19:54.240
 There are elements of the Austrian school of thought, which are worthwhile.

19:54.240 --> 19:59.080
 What is Austrian economics in this beautiful whirlwind picture that you painted?

19:59.080 --> 20:00.080
 Okay.

20:00.080 --> 20:04.280
 Austrian economics grew out of the rebellion against the classical school.

20:04.280 --> 20:09.440
 So you had three intellects who mainly led the growth of the neoclassical school back

20:09.440 --> 20:10.440
 in the 1870s.

20:10.440 --> 20:17.600
 It was William Jevons from England, Menger, who's from Austria, and Vollras from France.

20:17.600 --> 20:26.400
 And Vollras tried to work out a set of equations to describe a multiproduct economy where there's

20:26.400 --> 20:29.840
 numerous producers and numerous consumers.

20:29.840 --> 20:34.040
 Everybody's both a producer and a consumer, and you try to work out a vector of prices

20:34.040 --> 20:37.720
 that will give you equilibrium in all markets instantaneously.

20:37.720 --> 20:40.360
 And that's his equilibrium orientation.

20:40.360 --> 20:44.040
 Jevons is also one about equilibrium, but he worked more at the aggregate level.

20:44.040 --> 20:48.880
 So there's a supply curve and a demand curve, and that's what Marshall ultimately codified.

20:48.880 --> 20:52.600
 Menger was pretty much saying that, well, yes, there might be an equilibrium, but you're

20:52.600 --> 20:54.480
 going to get disturbed from it all the time.

20:54.480 --> 20:56.080
 You'll be above or below the equilibrium.

20:56.080 --> 21:00.560
 And what came out of the Austrian school was an acceptance of that sort of vision that

21:00.560 --> 21:04.400
 a market should reach equilibrium, but then said, well, you'll get disturbed away from

21:04.400 --> 21:05.720
 the equilibrium.

21:05.720 --> 21:10.960
 And that's what gives you the vitality of capitalism, because an entrepreneur will see

21:10.960 --> 21:15.840
 an arbitrage advantage and try to close that gap, and that will give you innovation over

21:15.840 --> 21:16.840
 time.

21:16.840 --> 21:21.240
 And Schumpeter went beyond that and saw the role of money and said that an entrepreneur

21:21.240 --> 21:25.120
 is somebody with a great idea and no money.

21:25.120 --> 21:28.860
 So to become a capitalist, you've got to get money.

21:28.860 --> 21:32.840
 And therefore, you've got to approach the finance sector to get the money, and the finance

21:32.840 --> 21:37.440
 sector creates money and also creates a debt for the entrepreneur.

21:37.440 --> 21:42.860
 And so you get this financial engine turning up as well, and you will get movements away

21:42.860 --> 21:44.800
 from equilibrium out of that.

21:44.800 --> 21:47.460
 You won't necessarily head back towards the equilibrium.

21:47.460 --> 21:54.200
 So Schumpeter has a rich vision of capitalism in which money plays an essential role, in

21:54.200 --> 21:59.200
 which you will be disturbed from equilibrium all the time.

21:59.200 --> 22:04.240
 And that is really, I think, a much closer vision of actual capitalism than anything

22:04.240 --> 22:13.840
 by even the leading Austrians, Hayek, et cetera, et cetera, and certainly Rombardo, I find

22:13.840 --> 22:20.840
 totally like reading a cardboard cutout version of The Wealth of Nations.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.680
 I find his work trivial.

22:23.680 --> 22:28.040
 But Schumpeter was rich, but with the same foundations as the Austrians.

22:28.040 --> 22:31.520
 But because he talked about the importance of money that took him away from the Austrian

22:31.520 --> 22:36.480
 vision, which is very much based on a hard money idea of capitalism, Schumpeter said

22:36.480 --> 22:42.700
 you needed the capacity of the financial sector to create money to empower entrepreneurs.

22:42.700 --> 22:44.880
 And that's a very important vision.

22:44.880 --> 22:48.800
 So Schumpeter's argument is the deviation from equilibrium, that's where all the fun

22:48.800 --> 22:49.800
 happens.

22:49.800 --> 22:50.800
 That's where all the magic happens.

22:50.800 --> 22:51.800
 That's the magic of capitalism.

22:51.800 --> 22:55.160
 And like the Austrians, because they focus on the deviation from equilibrium, they're

22:55.160 --> 23:00.000
 better than their classicals, but they still have this belief in the, you'll reach equilibrium

23:00.000 --> 23:06.160
 ultimately or you'll head back towards it, whereas they don't have an explanation of

23:06.160 --> 23:11.160
 capitalism that gives you cycles apart from having the wrong rate of interest.

23:11.160 --> 23:13.840
 So there's no role for an accumulation of debt over time.

23:13.840 --> 23:20.080
 So what Schumpeter gave us was a vision of the creativity of capitalism being driven

23:20.080 --> 23:25.160
 by entrepreneurs who are funded by money creation by the finance sector.

23:25.160 --> 23:29.000
 And that's fundamentally the world in which we live.

23:29.000 --> 23:36.400
 So there's also the kids these days are all into modern monetary theory, what's that

23:36.400 --> 23:37.400
 about?

23:37.400 --> 23:38.400
 Okay.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.400
 Modern monetary theory is accounting.

23:39.400 --> 23:42.280
 I want to summarize it bluntly.

23:42.280 --> 23:46.600
 It's simply saying let's do the accounting because what money is, is a creature of double

23:46.600 --> 23:47.600
 entry bookkeeping.

23:47.600 --> 23:48.600
 Okay.

23:48.600 --> 23:50.600
 What's double entry bookkeeping?

23:50.600 --> 23:53.080
 This was invented back in the 1500s in Italy.

23:53.080 --> 23:57.920
 I've forgotten the particular merchant who did it based on some Arabic ideas as well.

23:57.920 --> 24:06.480
 But the thing is, if you want to keep track of your financial flows, then you divide all

24:06.480 --> 24:08.280
 the financial claims on you.

24:08.280 --> 24:12.200
 You divide into claims you have on somebody else, which are your assets, claims somebody

24:12.200 --> 24:17.200
 else has on you, which are your liabilities, and the gap between the two is your equity.

24:17.200 --> 24:20.200
 So you record every transaction twice on one row.

24:20.200 --> 24:21.200
 Okay.

24:21.200 --> 24:26.440
 So for example, if you and I do a financial transfer, you have a bank account, I have

24:26.440 --> 24:30.480
 a bank account, your bank account will go down, mine goes up.

24:30.480 --> 24:31.480
 Okay.

24:31.480 --> 24:34.200
 And that's the sum of the operation is zero.

24:34.200 --> 24:35.200
 Okay.

24:35.200 --> 24:38.440
 But on the other hand, if I go to a bank and borrow money, then my account goes up, they

24:38.440 --> 24:41.600
 put money in my deposit account, the bank's assets go up.

24:41.600 --> 24:42.600
 Okay.

24:42.600 --> 24:47.000
 And there's still the same sum applies, assets minus liabilities minus equity equals zero.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.960
 Now that's simply saying money is an accounting, a creature of accounting.

24:51.960 --> 24:54.000
 It's not a creature of a commodity.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
 So if you think about how Austrians think about money, and how gold bugs think about

24:58.000 --> 25:02.980
 money and Bitcoin enthusiasts, if there are any left, think about money, what they see

25:02.980 --> 25:04.600
 is money is an object.

25:04.600 --> 25:05.600
 Okay.

25:05.600 --> 25:11.840
 And you and I can both have more gold, if we're both willing to go to this mine somewhere

25:11.840 --> 25:14.820
 and dig a few holes and get a few specks of gold out.

25:14.820 --> 25:20.420
 So there's no competition or no interaction between you and me if money is gold.

25:20.420 --> 25:23.140
 And they think money should be an object, a commodity.

25:23.140 --> 25:25.800
 But money fundamentally is not a commodity.

25:25.800 --> 25:28.260
 It's a claim on somebody else.

25:28.260 --> 25:29.640
 That's money's essence.

25:29.640 --> 25:32.660
 So when you do it, you must use double entry bookkeeping to do it.

25:32.660 --> 25:36.200
 And then when you do, you find all the answers that come out of thinking of money as a commodity

25:36.200 --> 25:37.480
 are wrong.

25:37.480 --> 25:39.300
 So for example, and I've got Elon on this one.

25:39.300 --> 25:43.000
 So I want to get this with Elon because I saw him making a comment about this a few

25:43.000 --> 25:44.420
 weeks ago on Twitter.

25:44.420 --> 25:47.380
 He said that it's wrong for the government, effectively it seems wrong for the government

25:47.380 --> 25:48.960
 to always be in deficit.

25:48.960 --> 25:49.960
 Okay.

25:49.960 --> 25:54.440
 Now, when you look at it and say, well, how is money created?

25:54.440 --> 25:59.460
 How does money come about when it's not a commodity like gold, which you dig up out

25:59.460 --> 26:03.960
 of the ground, when it's actually social relations between people that create money?

26:03.960 --> 26:11.400
 Well, money is the fundamentally the liabilities of the banking sector.

26:11.400 --> 26:17.360
 If we make a transfer between us, your deposit account goes down, my deposit account goes

26:17.360 --> 26:18.560
 up.

26:18.560 --> 26:23.640
 Deposit exchange is on the liability side of the banking sector.

26:23.640 --> 26:28.400
 But if we have a transaction with a bank, then if the bank lends us money, as its loans

26:28.400 --> 26:32.100
 go up, its deposits go up, again, that same balance.

26:32.100 --> 26:36.680
 So you've got to look and say, money therefore is fundamentally the liabilities of the banking

26:36.680 --> 26:37.760
 sector.

26:37.760 --> 26:40.480
 So how do you create additional liabilities?

26:40.480 --> 26:45.760
 You must have an operation which occurs both on the liability side and the asset side of

26:45.760 --> 26:46.920
 the banking sector.

26:46.920 --> 26:51.840
 So if you and I make a new transaction, no money is created.

26:51.840 --> 26:53.520
 Existing money is redistributed.

26:53.520 --> 26:58.400
 But if you go to a bank and take out a bank loan, then money is created by the bank loan.

26:58.400 --> 27:02.480
 So the liabilities of the banking sector rise, the assets rise, they're balanced, but more

27:02.480 --> 27:06.080
 liabilities of the banking sector means more money.

27:06.080 --> 27:08.840
 So that's how private banks create money.

27:08.840 --> 27:15.000
 And that's what I first started working on when I became an academic about 35 years ago,

27:15.000 --> 27:17.040
 the actual dynamics of private money creation.

27:17.040 --> 27:19.540
 But the government has the same sort of story.

27:19.540 --> 27:26.560
 If the government runs a deficit, it spends more money on the individuals in the economy

27:26.560 --> 27:31.440
 than it taxes them, which means their bank accounts increase.

27:31.440 --> 27:36.860
 So a government deficit creates money for the private sector.

27:36.860 --> 27:39.320
 So that's where money creation occurs from the government.

27:39.320 --> 27:47.240
 So it puts more money into people's bank accounts by spending, by welfare payments than it takes

27:47.240 --> 27:49.080
 out by taxation.

27:49.080 --> 27:50.920
 So that's creating new money.

27:50.920 --> 27:55.800
 And then on the other side on the bank, the money turns up in the reserve accounts of

27:55.800 --> 28:00.480
 the banks, which are basically the private bank's bank accounts at the central bank.

28:00.480 --> 28:06.780
 So rather than the asset of private money creation being loans, the asset of government

28:06.780 --> 28:09.880
 money creation is reserves.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.360
 Okay?

28:11.360 --> 28:12.360
 Right.

28:12.360 --> 28:13.360
 Money creation.

28:13.360 --> 28:14.360
 Money creation.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.360
 It's a good thing.

28:15.360 --> 28:19.200
 So you mentioned a bunch of stuff like private money creation with the liabilities in the

28:19.200 --> 28:24.120
 banks and then how the government is doing, the reserves, blah, blah, blah.

28:24.120 --> 28:29.120
 At the end of the day, there's a bunch of printers that are printing money.

28:29.120 --> 28:33.680
 And then you also said something interesting, which is social relations between humans is

28:33.680 --> 28:35.480
 what creates money.

28:35.480 --> 28:40.440
 I think my mind was blown several times over the past minute.

28:40.440 --> 28:44.720
 So it's difficult for me to reconstruct the pieces of my mind back together.

28:44.720 --> 28:50.920
 But basic question, is money creation a good thing or a bad thing?

28:50.920 --> 28:56.840
 Money creation is a good thing because money creation is what allows commerce to happen.

28:56.840 --> 28:58.320
 Isn't there a conservation of...

28:58.320 --> 28:59.320
 No, there isn't.

28:59.320 --> 29:03.160
 I had to have arguments with physicists over this and it took me a long time to answer

29:03.160 --> 29:04.160
 it.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.840
 So the sum total of all money is zero.

29:05.840 --> 29:06.840
 Yeah.

29:06.840 --> 29:07.840
 Okay.

29:07.840 --> 29:10.720
 It's the sum total of all assets and liabilities is zero.

29:10.720 --> 29:18.040
 So if you imagine your assets minus your liabilities is your equity and your asset is somebody

29:18.040 --> 29:21.720
 else's liability and your liability is somebody else's asset.

29:21.720 --> 29:24.960
 When we're talking about financial assets, and this is another mind blowing thing that

29:24.960 --> 29:27.920
 I've just recently solved myself.

29:27.920 --> 29:31.840
 So the sum total of all financial assets and liabilities is zero.

29:31.840 --> 29:32.840
 Okay.

29:32.840 --> 29:33.840
 Wait, wait, wait.

29:33.840 --> 29:36.000
 I'm sorry to interrupt you rudely.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.300
 What are assets?

29:37.300 --> 29:38.480
 What are liabilities?

29:38.480 --> 29:41.120
 Assets are your claims on somebody else.

29:41.120 --> 29:42.120
 So...

29:42.120 --> 29:43.120
 Specific.

29:43.120 --> 29:44.680
 Give me an example of an asset.

29:44.680 --> 29:45.680
 Okay.

29:45.680 --> 29:46.680
 Do you have a mortgage for this house?

29:46.680 --> 29:47.680
 No.

29:47.680 --> 29:48.680
 I'm renting.

29:48.680 --> 29:49.680
 You're renting.

29:49.680 --> 29:50.680
 There you go.

29:50.680 --> 29:51.680
 Well, if you had a mortgage, that'd be your liability.

29:51.680 --> 29:53.160
 That would be my liability.

29:53.160 --> 29:54.160
 Okay.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.400
 The mortgage with the bank's asset.

29:55.400 --> 29:56.400
 Right.

29:56.400 --> 29:57.400
 Okay.

29:57.400 --> 29:58.400
 If you add the two together, you get zero.

29:58.400 --> 29:59.400
 Okay.

29:59.400 --> 30:00.400
 So that's zero.

30:00.400 --> 30:01.400
 That's zero.

30:01.400 --> 30:04.360
 So money is the liabilities side of the banking sector.

30:04.360 --> 30:05.360
 Okay.

30:05.360 --> 30:06.360
 Okay.

30:06.360 --> 30:08.480
 Assets are the...

30:08.480 --> 30:12.200
 The assets on the other side can be either created by the banking sector, which is where

30:12.200 --> 30:16.640
 you get bank loans, or created by the government, where you get reserves.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.120
 But money is the liabilities.

30:18.120 --> 30:19.120
 Money is...

30:19.120 --> 30:23.800
 If you think about protons and anti protons, in that sense, money is like the anti proton.

30:23.800 --> 30:25.760
 It's the negative, the liability.

30:25.760 --> 30:27.600
 But wait, wait, wait.

30:27.600 --> 30:30.960
 The liability is the negative.

30:30.960 --> 30:31.960
 Yeah.

30:31.960 --> 30:32.960
 How's that money?

30:32.960 --> 30:33.960
 I thought money is the positive.

30:33.960 --> 30:37.880
 What is the liability for the banking sector is an asset for you and me.

30:37.880 --> 30:39.720
 And assets includes money?

30:39.720 --> 30:40.720
 Yeah.

30:40.720 --> 30:41.720
 Yeah.

30:41.720 --> 30:42.720
 Okay.

30:42.720 --> 30:45.520
 If you have a bank account, you'd have a bank account, and you'd have some cash.

30:45.520 --> 30:46.520
 Yeah.

30:46.520 --> 30:47.520
 Okay.

30:47.520 --> 30:48.520
 Those are your assets.

30:48.520 --> 30:53.560
 But the bank account is a liability of the banking sector, and the cash is a liability

30:53.560 --> 30:55.040
 of the Federal Reserve.

30:55.040 --> 30:56.040
 Okay.

30:56.040 --> 30:57.040
 So what's money?

30:57.040 --> 31:04.280
 Well, money is the promise of a third party that we both accept to close our transaction.

31:04.280 --> 31:05.280
 And this is...

31:05.280 --> 31:06.280
 And that's a bank with a liability?

31:06.280 --> 31:07.280
 That's a bank.

31:07.280 --> 31:08.280
 Yeah.

31:08.280 --> 31:12.120
 One of the most important works I've ever read is a work by a wonderful, now unfortunately

31:12.120 --> 31:18.000
 deceased, Italian economist called Augusto Graziani.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.120
 And he's the most wonderful personality.

31:20.120 --> 31:26.160
 Augusto, I met him on a few occasions, is one of the few human beings who can speak

31:26.160 --> 31:31.260
 in perfectly formed paragraphs, okay, superbly eloquent.

31:31.260 --> 31:36.060
 And what he did was write a paper called The Monetary Theory of Production.

31:36.060 --> 31:41.640
 You can find it, download it on the web, it's pretty much open source now.

31:41.640 --> 31:45.400
 And what he said is, what distinguishes a monetary economy from a barter economy?

31:45.400 --> 31:50.840
 So he said, in a barter economy, what we do is, you know, I'll give you two of these for

31:50.840 --> 31:51.840
 one of those.

31:51.840 --> 31:52.840
 Yeah.

31:52.840 --> 31:53.840
 Okay, barter.

31:53.840 --> 31:57.600
 So we've got a relative price, there are two of us involved, and there are two commodities.

31:57.600 --> 32:02.440
 So with money, money is a triangular transaction, okay?

32:02.440 --> 32:08.640
 There is one commodity, I want to buy that can of drink off you, two people, and the

32:08.640 --> 32:14.540
 price that's worked out ends up being in a transfer from the promises to pay the bank

32:14.540 --> 32:19.240
 that the buyer has to the promises to pay the bank that the seller has.

32:19.240 --> 32:26.380
 So if I, so what you have is a monetary transaction in a capitalist economy involves three agents,

32:26.380 --> 32:28.160
 the buyer, the seller, and the bank.

32:28.160 --> 32:29.960
 So the bank always has to be part of it.

32:29.960 --> 32:32.160
 Well, the bank has to be part of it.

32:32.160 --> 32:37.600
 When I hand you the money, you accept that as you've now got, rather than it's the bank

32:37.600 --> 32:41.320
 promising to pay me something, it's now the bank promising to pay you something.

32:41.320 --> 32:46.040
 And we exchange the promises of banks, and that's fundamentally money.

32:46.040 --> 32:51.440
 So money is fundamentally a threesome, and everybody gets fucked.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.200
 Is that a good way to put it?

32:53.200 --> 32:54.200
 No, I'm just kidding.

32:54.200 --> 32:57.520
 It leaves it, it leaves it for the guy to be like, oh no, I can use French in this conversation,

32:57.520 --> 32:58.520
 that's good.

32:58.520 --> 33:03.560
 That's not French, that's a different language, I'll explain it to you one day.

33:03.560 --> 33:05.800
 You Australians will never understand.

33:05.800 --> 33:09.360
 Okay, if I can return to, we'll jump around if it's okay.

33:09.360 --> 33:10.360
 Oh, that's fine.

33:10.360 --> 33:18.800
 So you mentioned Karl Marx as one of the great intellects, economic thinkers ever.

33:18.800 --> 33:21.040
 He might be number one.

33:21.040 --> 33:26.080
 You study him quite a bit, you disagree with him quite a bit, but you still think he's

33:26.080 --> 33:28.040
 a powerful thinker.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.040
 A powerful mind.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.480
 A powerful mind.

33:30.480 --> 33:36.720
 So first of all, let's just explore the human.

33:36.720 --> 33:38.060
 Why do you say so?

33:38.060 --> 33:40.100
 What's interesting in that mind?

33:40.100 --> 33:45.520
 In the way he saw the world, what are the insights that you find brilliant?

33:45.520 --> 33:54.360
 Marx once described his major work as, towards a critical examination of everything existing.

33:54.360 --> 33:56.180
 So he's a modest bastard.

33:56.180 --> 34:00.040
 So he wanted to understand and criticize everything.

34:00.040 --> 34:08.240
 And even, he wasn't trained directly by Hegel, but his teachers were Hegelian philosophers.

34:08.240 --> 34:12.760
 And what Hegel developed was a concept called dialectics.

34:12.760 --> 34:15.580
 And dialectics is the philosophy of change.

34:15.580 --> 34:21.520
 And when most people hear the word dialectics, they come up with this unpronounceable trio

34:21.520 --> 34:25.760
 of words called thesis, antithesis, synthesis.

34:25.760 --> 34:28.040
 I can barely get the words out myself.

34:28.040 --> 34:29.480
 And that actually is not Hegel at all.

34:29.480 --> 34:30.480
 That's another German philosopher.

34:30.480 --> 34:31.480
 Kant?

34:31.480 --> 34:32.480
 Fichte.

34:32.480 --> 34:33.480
 Oh, I thought it was Kant.

34:33.480 --> 34:34.480
 No, Fichte.

34:34.480 --> 34:35.480
 Well, I'm not sure.

34:35.480 --> 34:36.480
 I mix them up.

34:36.480 --> 34:37.480
 All Germans look the same to me.

34:37.480 --> 34:38.480
 Yeah.

34:38.480 --> 34:39.480
 Yeah.

34:39.480 --> 34:42.760
 So, but if you look, there's a beautiful book called Marx and Contradiction.

34:42.760 --> 34:45.720
 You want to find a great explanation for Marx's philosophy.

34:45.720 --> 34:46.720
 I've forgotten the author.

34:46.720 --> 34:50.960
 I think it's Wild, W I L D E, Marx and Contradiction.

34:50.960 --> 34:55.120
 And he points out the actual origins of Marx's philosophy, but I didn't know that when I

34:55.120 --> 34:56.120
 first read Marx.

34:56.120 --> 35:01.500
 So I became exposed to Marx when I was a student at Sydney University.

35:01.500 --> 35:06.840
 And we'd had a strike at the university over the teaching of philosophy.

35:06.840 --> 35:11.320
 And what happened was the philosophy department had a lot of radical philosophers in it and

35:11.320 --> 35:14.000
 a conservative chief philosopher.

35:14.000 --> 35:21.040
 And the radicals wanted to have a course on what they called philosophical aspects of

35:21.040 --> 35:22.740
 feminist thought.

35:22.740 --> 35:24.280
 And the staff voted in favor of it.

35:24.280 --> 35:27.640
 This is back in the days when university departments were democratic.

35:27.640 --> 35:29.040
 The professor opposed it.

35:29.040 --> 35:30.280
 He got it blocked at a high level.

35:30.280 --> 35:34.600
 The staff lipfrogged over that, and then finally the vice chancellor blocked it.

35:34.600 --> 35:39.480
 So that led to a strike over the teaching of philosophy at Sydney University, which

35:39.480 --> 35:45.040
 at one stage, over half the students were on strike.

35:45.040 --> 35:46.040
 Economics began out of that.

35:46.040 --> 35:48.680
 Over teaching of a philosophy of feminism.

35:48.680 --> 35:49.680
 Yes.

35:49.680 --> 35:50.680
 God, it's good to be a student.

35:50.680 --> 35:53.260
 That's such a different life to what we're living now.

35:53.260 --> 35:58.720
 That's the academic milieu in which I developed all my ideas.

35:58.720 --> 35:59.840
 And I had become a critic.

35:59.840 --> 36:03.740
 I've gone from being a believer of mainstream economics when I was a first year student

36:03.740 --> 36:06.680
 to disbelieving it halfway through first year.

36:06.680 --> 36:07.680
 Okay.

36:07.680 --> 36:11.280
 And I then spent a long time trying to change it, getting nowhere.

36:11.280 --> 36:15.500
 And then this philosophy strike happened and we took it on in economics and we formed what's

36:15.500 --> 36:19.860
 called the political economy movement and had a successful strike.

36:19.860 --> 36:25.520
 We actually managed to pressure the university into establishing a department of political

36:25.520 --> 36:28.760
 economy at Sydney University, as well as a department of economics.

36:28.760 --> 36:30.720
 What was the foundational ideas?

36:30.720 --> 36:37.120
 Were you resistant to the whole censorship of why can't you have a philosophy of anything

36:37.120 --> 36:38.120
 kind of course?

36:38.120 --> 36:44.560
 Well, it was much more libertarian in the genuine sense of the word, period of time,

36:44.560 --> 36:49.600
 at the end of the 60s, beginning of the 70s than the word libertarian has been corrupted

36:49.600 --> 36:50.600
 since then.

36:50.600 --> 36:52.500
 But it really was about free thought.

36:52.500 --> 36:54.060
 And you went to university to learn.

36:54.060 --> 36:55.060
 It was about education.

36:55.060 --> 36:59.240
 I remember having a fight with my father once where dad was angry about the marks I was

36:59.240 --> 37:01.120
 getting for some of my courses.

37:01.120 --> 37:04.280
 And he said, if you don't get a decent result, you won't get a decent job.

37:04.280 --> 37:05.440
 And I said, I'm not here to get a job.

37:05.440 --> 37:06.440
 I'm here to get an education.

37:06.440 --> 37:07.440
 Oh, wow.

37:07.440 --> 37:08.440
 Okay.

37:08.440 --> 37:11.480
 Now, the thing is, ultimately, it's been a pretty good job for me as well.

37:11.480 --> 37:16.160
 This is in Sydney, by the way, and Sydney in summer is absolutely gorgeous.

37:16.160 --> 37:20.320
 And what does a bunch of lefties decide to do during summer but read Karl Marx?

37:20.320 --> 37:21.320
 Yeah.

37:21.320 --> 37:22.320
 On the beach or?

37:22.320 --> 37:27.480
 Actually, inside the room of the philosophy department at the University of Sydney in

37:27.480 --> 37:28.480
 the main quadrangle.

37:28.480 --> 37:32.840
 There's sandstone all around us, and we have a bunch of about 20 or 30 of us reading our

37:32.840 --> 37:33.840
 way through Marx.

37:33.840 --> 37:34.840
 Capital?

37:34.840 --> 37:35.840
 Which capital?

37:35.840 --> 37:38.540
 It was volume one capital.

37:38.540 --> 37:46.000
 And I remember walking off to that meeting with one of my friends who's a law student.

37:46.000 --> 37:51.240
 And this was a period of a huge construction boom in Sydney, so the whole skyline, which

37:51.240 --> 37:55.200
 we could see from the campus, was full of what they call kangaroo cranes, which were

37:55.200 --> 37:59.640
 an Australian invention, that are cranes that can be leapfrogged over each other to build

37:59.640 --> 38:00.640
 a skyscraper.

38:00.640 --> 38:05.840
 So, here you are reading Karl Marx, looking at the mechanisms of capital.

38:05.840 --> 38:09.720
 And I looked at those mechanisms, and I knew Marx argued that labor was the only source

38:09.720 --> 38:10.720
 of value.

38:10.720 --> 38:11.720
 Yeah.

38:11.720 --> 38:12.720
 And he said machinery doesn't add value.

38:12.720 --> 38:14.760
 So, the cranes are worthless.

38:14.760 --> 38:18.120
 I'm looking at these cranes and thinking, I want a very good explanation by Marx as

38:18.120 --> 38:20.080
 to why these cranes don't add value.

38:20.080 --> 38:24.680
 So, reading through the first seven chapters of Capital, what you found was Marx applying

38:24.680 --> 38:26.200
 this dialectic.

38:26.200 --> 38:28.040
 And like the Fichte and stuff is bullshit.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.560
 That is not how Marx thought at all.

38:29.560 --> 38:34.040
 I was reading, trying to find the thesis and the synthesis, and it's not there at all in

38:34.040 --> 38:35.040
 any of Marx's works.

38:35.040 --> 38:42.600
 And I've read everything he's ever written on economics from 1844 to 1894, when his last

38:42.600 --> 38:44.080
 books were published.

38:44.080 --> 38:45.440
 There's not one word of mention of that.

38:45.440 --> 38:49.480
 What he does talk about is foreground and background and tension.

38:49.480 --> 38:57.720
 And his idea of a dialectic is that a unity will exist in society, and that unity can

38:57.720 --> 39:01.200
 be individual, it can be a commodity, anything at all.

39:01.200 --> 39:05.440
 The unity will be understood by that society.

39:05.440 --> 39:07.200
 One particular aspect will be focused upon.

39:07.200 --> 39:12.240
 So, if you think about the human being in capitalism, the focus on the human being as

39:12.240 --> 39:14.840
 an object is their capacity to work.

39:14.840 --> 39:17.120
 You're a worker, okay?

39:17.120 --> 39:19.800
 It's put in the foreground.

39:19.800 --> 39:23.280
 The fact that you're human and you want to play a guitar and go surfing and make love

39:23.280 --> 39:27.360
 and all the other things that humans do is pushed into the background.

39:27.360 --> 39:30.400
 There's a tension between the two of those.

39:30.400 --> 39:33.320
 And that can transform that unity over time.

39:33.320 --> 39:37.640
 And that's a beautiful dynamic vision of change.

39:37.640 --> 39:40.040
 So dialectics is a philosophy of change.

39:40.040 --> 39:45.800
 So synthesis, antithesis is what does every idea have a counter argument?

39:45.800 --> 39:46.800
 Yeah.

39:46.800 --> 39:48.760
 There's a positive and negative and you bring them together somehow.

39:48.760 --> 39:52.440
 And then Marx has this foreground, background, and tension.

39:52.440 --> 39:56.940
 Foreground is all what we think of as economics and background is all the lovemaking we do

39:56.940 --> 39:57.940
 as humans.

39:57.940 --> 39:58.940
 That sort of thing.

39:58.940 --> 40:01.360
 And why is there a tension?

40:01.360 --> 40:07.520
 Because if you imagine the unity, like if you take a human in a, any preview, like

40:07.520 --> 40:12.560
 if you go back to Cro Magnum days, when we're living in caves and we've got to go hunting

40:12.560 --> 40:16.760
 and cook food and stuff like that, but there's no social hierarchy.

40:16.760 --> 40:20.480
 Because we've become used to, so you don't get labored as a worker or a capitalist.

40:20.480 --> 40:22.740
 You're just a human in that situation.

40:22.740 --> 40:26.360
 Then you've got more an integrated view of who you are.

40:26.360 --> 40:30.360
 And I think that's one of the appeals of a tribal, a genuine tribal culture that you

40:30.360 --> 40:32.520
 get treated for the whole of who you are.

40:32.520 --> 40:36.340
 You've certainly categorized you're male, you're female, you're young, you're old,

40:36.340 --> 40:39.440
 you're a hunter, you're a tool maker, et cetera, et cetera.

40:39.440 --> 40:41.740
 But you're treated as more an integrated object.

40:41.740 --> 40:47.040
 When you get put in a complex society, like a capitalist society, then one side of you's

40:47.040 --> 40:48.960
 emphasized and the others are deemphasized.

40:48.960 --> 40:54.520
 So is it fair to say that the background is like our basic fundamental humanity and the

40:54.520 --> 40:56.840
 foreground is the machine of capitalism?

40:56.840 --> 40:57.840
 Effectively.

40:57.840 --> 41:01.960
 And when you look at it in terms of a human, but what Marx did is apply this to a commodity.

41:01.960 --> 41:05.760
 So he said, what is the essential unity in a capitalist economy?

41:05.760 --> 41:08.360
 And the essential unity is a commodity.

41:08.360 --> 41:10.440
 The essential unit.

41:10.440 --> 41:12.120
 The essential unity.

41:12.120 --> 41:13.120
 What's unity?

41:13.120 --> 41:15.040
 Unity is an object in society.

41:15.040 --> 41:16.040
 Okay.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.040
 Okay.

41:17.040 --> 41:20.260
 So he started from the point of view of trying to understand how exchange occurs.

41:20.260 --> 41:21.800
 How do we set prices?

41:21.800 --> 41:28.720
 And his starting vision was to say that a commodity is a unity in a capitalist economy.

41:28.720 --> 41:35.280
 The part of the unity that we focus upon is the exchange value.

41:35.280 --> 41:41.200
 A capitalist produces a commodity, not because of its qualitative characteristics, but because

41:41.200 --> 41:43.080
 it'd be sold for a profit.

41:43.080 --> 41:47.040
 So the foreground aspect of a commodity is its exchange value.

41:47.040 --> 41:52.720
 The background aspect of it, it won't succeed as a commodity unless it has a use value.

41:52.720 --> 41:55.280
 So the background is the utility thing.

41:55.280 --> 41:56.280
 Yeah.

41:56.280 --> 42:01.800
 See, if you made something which didn't work, okay, then you might be able to sell it, but

42:01.800 --> 42:02.800
 it has no utility.

42:02.800 --> 42:05.360
 You can't make that into a commodity.

42:05.360 --> 42:06.360
 A broken thing can't be sold.

42:06.360 --> 42:07.360
 Does that have the subjective?

42:07.360 --> 42:12.200
 Yeah, it has to have the subjective side as well as the objective.

42:12.200 --> 42:14.000
 So the objective is what capitalists worry about.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.200
 I'll give you my favorite counter example of that.

42:16.200 --> 42:21.060
 I took a bunch of Australian journalists to China way back in the period when the Gang

42:21.060 --> 42:28.360
 of Four was being on trial, and we did a tour of the Forbidden City in Beijing.

42:28.360 --> 42:33.240
 And at that stage, all the artifacts of the royal family, the emperor, were actually in

42:33.240 --> 42:34.240
 the building still.

42:34.240 --> 42:41.160
 And we walked past one of them, and it was this gold, solid gold bar about this long,

42:41.160 --> 42:43.080
 shaped like a fist, turned over like this.

42:43.080 --> 42:46.480
 And on this side, there were rubies, emeralds, diamonds.

42:46.480 --> 42:47.480
 You'd never seen gemstones.

42:47.480 --> 42:49.900
 I mean, gems that big, okay?

42:49.900 --> 42:52.720
 And one of the journalists asked me what I thought it was, and I said, oh, it's obvious.

42:52.720 --> 42:55.280
 Jane is a backscratcher, ha, ha, ha.

42:55.280 --> 42:56.280
 I walked away.

42:56.280 --> 43:01.480
 She caught up with me about 20 minutes later, said, I asked one of the guides, it is a backscratcher.

43:01.480 --> 43:06.040
 So here's a backscratcher for the emperor made of solid gold with diamonds and rubies

43:06.040 --> 43:07.720
 and emeralds during the scratching.

43:07.720 --> 43:11.080
 Now, that's a commodity in a feudal society, okay?

43:11.080 --> 43:13.380
 The cost doesn't matter.

43:13.380 --> 43:16.880
 You want the most elaborate, beautiful thing because you are the emperor.

43:16.880 --> 43:22.720
 So in a feudal society, the commodity, what's focused upon is the utility.

43:22.720 --> 43:26.520
 And the cost of production when you're the emperor is immaterial.

43:26.520 --> 43:28.240
 Capitalism reverses that.

43:28.240 --> 43:33.020
 So the commodity in a capitalist economy is a plastic $2.00 scratchy you can get from

43:33.020 --> 43:35.840
 Kmart or Target.

43:35.840 --> 43:42.400
 And so the use value is necessary but irrelevant to forming the price.

43:42.400 --> 43:47.600
 Now, that was a completely different vision of exchange in capitalism to what I found

43:47.600 --> 43:52.440
 in the neoclassical theory because that says it's the marginal utility and the marginal

43:52.440 --> 43:57.040
 cost of everything that determines the exchange ratio.

43:57.040 --> 44:02.640
 And the crazy thing about that is not so much the marginal utility, but the argument in

44:02.640 --> 44:07.480
 the neoclassical theory is that the price ratio, the price will, when there's an exchange

44:07.480 --> 44:16.440
 going on, there's two person, two commodity exchange of two commodities between two people.

44:16.440 --> 44:21.360
 The price will change until such time as the ratio of the marginal utilities is equal to

44:21.360 --> 44:25.320
 the ratio of the marginal costs that's supposed to be the equilibrium.

44:25.320 --> 44:27.160
 And Marx says that's bullshit.

44:27.160 --> 44:33.040
 That's a previous society where you exchange stuff that you happen to have for stuff somebody

44:33.040 --> 44:37.400
 else happened to have without any real production mechanism being involved.

44:37.400 --> 44:42.400
 And he said that's like when you have two ancient tribes meeting for the very first

44:42.400 --> 44:46.720
 time and one tribe can make something the other tribe can't make.

44:46.720 --> 44:52.080
 And they will therefore, the price they were willing to pay will reflect how unique this

44:52.080 --> 44:55.480
 other object is that this one tribe can make and the other can't.

44:55.480 --> 45:00.600
 So for example, the story of Manhattan being sold for 40 glass beads, it's actually 40

45:00.600 --> 45:03.960
 glass trading beads, I believe it is a true story.

45:03.960 --> 45:07.680
 But the thing is the Indians couldn't make glass beads.

45:07.680 --> 45:12.360
 So they valued the glass beads at the island of Manhattan, okay, which is a utility based

45:12.360 --> 45:13.360
 comparison.

45:13.360 --> 45:17.560
 And what Marx said, that's the very initial contact over time, even if you don't know

45:17.560 --> 45:18.560
 the technology.

45:18.560 --> 45:23.800
 Over time, you start to realize how much work goes involved to making what they're selling

45:23.800 --> 45:26.680
 you versus what you're selling to them.

45:26.680 --> 45:29.920
 And you start making stuff specifically for sale.

45:29.920 --> 45:37.080
 So you know, Elon's not losing personal utility each time a Model 3 goes out the door.

45:37.080 --> 45:41.360
 He might get utility out of the fact that he's created that vehicle, that concept and

45:41.360 --> 45:45.460
 manufactures it and so on, but he's not losing utility each time a Model T Ford goes out

45:45.460 --> 45:50.360
 the door, going back for the ancient commodity there.

45:50.360 --> 45:56.440
 So the utility plays no role in setting price in Marx's model.

45:56.440 --> 45:59.200
 Whereas it's essential in the neoclassical model.

45:59.200 --> 46:02.000
 What's the difference between utility and marginal utility?

46:02.000 --> 46:04.720
 What does the word marginal mean?

46:04.720 --> 46:06.380
 And why is it such a problem?

46:06.380 --> 46:11.640
 It turns marginal utility or utility itself has different meanings than the two schools

46:11.640 --> 46:12.640
 of thought.

46:12.640 --> 46:17.240
 If you take the classical school of thought, which when Marx comes from, utility is effectively

46:17.240 --> 46:18.240
 objective.

46:18.240 --> 46:22.680
 So the utility of a chair is that you can sit in it, okay, not how comfortable it makes

46:22.680 --> 46:23.680
 you feel.

46:23.680 --> 46:27.240
 Okay, now if you think about the utility of the chairs, we're both sitting and they're

46:27.240 --> 46:30.760
 identical from a classical point of view, we're both sitting.

46:30.760 --> 46:34.600
 But from a neoclassical point of view, it's how comfortable it makes you feel.

46:34.600 --> 46:37.960
 And that depends upon your subjective feelings of comfort.

46:37.960 --> 46:42.120
 You might be far more comfortable in the identical chair that I'm sitting in than I am.

46:42.120 --> 46:44.120
 And therefore, the comparison is difficult.

46:44.120 --> 46:49.720
 And therefore, working out a ratio involves you've got a decline in your, each time you

46:49.720 --> 46:58.160
 give away a chair in exchange for an iPhone, you have a fall in your utility, okay?

46:58.160 --> 47:03.380
 And then therefore, you want a higher return because you're losing more utility each time.

47:03.380 --> 47:06.120
 The more chairs you give away, the less utility you're getting from chairs.

47:06.120 --> 47:08.640
 So there's a decline in your utility.

47:08.640 --> 47:11.060
 That's your marginal utility.

47:11.060 --> 47:15.380
 So it's including your subjective valuation in setting the price.

47:15.380 --> 47:20.960
 And what Marx pointed out is this is a caricature of actual change in a capitalist economy because

47:20.960 --> 47:25.400
 we have, in a capitalist economy, huge factories turning out huge quantities, specifically

47:25.400 --> 47:26.400
 for sale.

47:26.400 --> 47:32.320
 They've got no utility to the seller unless they're sold, okay?

47:32.320 --> 47:36.200
 So it's a very different vision of how price is set.

47:36.200 --> 47:42.440
 And Marx used that to explain where profit comes from, but he made a mistake.

47:42.440 --> 47:49.120
 And his argument was that talking about a worker, as now your unity, this foreground

47:49.120 --> 47:55.820
 background tension thing, the foreground is that you hire a worker for their cost of production.

47:55.820 --> 48:00.320
 And the cost of production is a subsistence wage, okay?

48:00.320 --> 48:05.960
 Their utility to the buyer is the fact that they can work in a factory.

48:05.960 --> 48:10.640
 Now, it might take six hours, let's say, to make the means of subsistence.

48:10.640 --> 48:14.840
 And that's the exchange value, and that's what the capitalist pays as a wage to the

48:14.840 --> 48:15.840
 worker.

48:15.840 --> 48:18.380
 But they can work in the factory for 12 hours.

48:18.380 --> 48:19.380
 That's the utility.

48:19.380 --> 48:26.240
 12 minus 6 is 6 surplus of value hours, and that's where profit comes from.

48:26.240 --> 48:27.920
 And that was Marx's argument.

48:27.920 --> 48:31.720
 And I thought it was brilliant, but it also applied to machinery.

48:31.720 --> 48:32.720
 Right, okay.

48:32.720 --> 48:33.720
 Let's blink on that.

48:33.720 --> 48:34.720
 Hold on a second.

48:34.720 --> 48:35.720
 No, no.

48:35.720 --> 48:36.720
 Deep is good.

48:36.720 --> 48:38.520
 You just want to define terms.

48:38.520 --> 48:43.080
 Don't take that statement out of context, the internet, please.

48:43.080 --> 48:44.080
 Okay.

48:44.080 --> 48:52.920
 You said buyer, seller, worker in a factory, who's the seller, who's the buyer?

48:52.920 --> 48:55.800
 Why is the worker the buyer?

48:55.800 --> 48:58.200
 The worker is the commodity in this case.

48:58.200 --> 49:01.760
 Because if you're going to make stuff in a factory, you've got to hire workers.

49:01.760 --> 49:02.760
 Yes.

49:02.760 --> 49:06.120
 And what Marx is saying, the buyer in that situation is a capitalist.

49:06.120 --> 49:07.660
 So what does the buyer pay?

49:07.660 --> 49:09.440
 He says he pays the exchange value.

49:09.440 --> 49:13.040
 That's back to the commodity thing, because that's the starting point.

49:13.040 --> 49:17.160
 He said the essential unity in a capitalist economy is the commodity.

49:17.160 --> 49:22.580
 A commodity has two characteristics, exchange value and use value.

49:22.580 --> 49:26.520
 Exchange value of a commodity in a capitalist economy will be its cost of production.

49:26.520 --> 49:31.220
 The use value is what you do with it, okay, once you've purchased it.

49:31.220 --> 49:34.100
 But labor is a commodity?

49:34.100 --> 49:38.120
 In this case, when a worker is being hired for a job, yes.

49:38.120 --> 49:43.520
 So the worker's labor has an exchange value and a use value as well?

49:43.520 --> 49:44.520
 That's it, yeah.

49:44.520 --> 49:45.520
 Use value.

49:45.520 --> 49:48.680
 Use value of a worker's labor.

49:48.680 --> 49:49.680
 Exchange value.

49:49.680 --> 49:54.320
 Let me think about that.

49:54.320 --> 49:58.480
 So the hours they put in is the use value.

49:58.480 --> 49:59.960
 Interesting.

49:59.960 --> 50:05.000
 So what does the worker want in this?

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
 What are the motivations?

50:06.000 --> 50:09.720
 Are we not considering the worker in this context as a human being?

50:09.720 --> 50:14.020
 Well, you come in and that's actually, that's the next layer.

50:14.020 --> 50:19.440
 What Marx gives us is like a layered cake, starting from a foundation of saying straight

50:19.440 --> 50:23.940
 commodity exchange, and then saying, well, you're treating a worker as a commodity.

50:23.940 --> 50:30.000
 Now a commodity is something like this, okay, that has, so far as I'm aware, no soul, okay?

50:30.000 --> 50:32.680
 Not going to be complaining if I turn it upside down.

50:32.680 --> 50:34.380
 It'll fall over.

50:34.380 --> 50:39.600
 So there's no soul there as a human, is both a commodity and a noncommodity.

50:39.600 --> 50:41.560
 And therefore there'll be a tension in the person.

50:41.560 --> 50:43.040
 I'm being treated as a commodity here.

50:43.040 --> 50:45.520
 I'm being paid just enough to stay alive.

50:45.520 --> 50:48.760
 I've got a wife and kids back at home.

50:48.760 --> 50:54.600
 So that is another layer of thinking in Marx, and on that layer he then says, well, workers

50:54.600 --> 50:57.000
 will therefore demand more than their value.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.800
 So that's when you get like political.

50:58.800 --> 51:01.400
 You get political and you get money coming above that and so on.

51:01.400 --> 51:07.240
 But the basic idea starts from the commodity is the fundamental unity in capitalism.

51:07.240 --> 51:12.280
 The important commodity in Marx's thinking was the worker, because that's where he said

51:12.280 --> 51:14.400
 profit came from, okay?

51:14.400 --> 51:18.000
 And then that explains the motivation of the capitalist, and that ultimately is the labor

51:18.000 --> 51:23.360
 theory of value and Marx's arguments about how capitalism will come to an end.

51:23.360 --> 51:24.600
 Okay, okay, okay.

51:24.600 --> 51:27.800
 So first of all, what is the labor theory of value?

51:27.800 --> 51:30.680
 And actually before that, what is value?

51:30.680 --> 51:35.440
 Is that, this is like me asking what's happiness.

51:35.440 --> 51:38.640
 Is there something interesting to say about trying to define value?

51:38.640 --> 51:45.240
 You vary, and this is a huge problem in economics is arguments of what does value mean?

51:45.240 --> 51:48.480
 And the neoclassicals came down as that it's subjective.

51:48.480 --> 51:54.080
 Its value is whatever you get out of it, but it's your personal evaluation of something,

51:54.080 --> 51:55.520
 your personal feelings.

51:55.520 --> 52:01.760
 So they've got that very subjective idea of value, whereas the Marxists, being inheritors

52:01.760 --> 52:06.440
 of classical school, talk in terms of objective value.

52:06.440 --> 52:11.880
 So the value is the number of hours it takes to make something, or the effort.

52:11.880 --> 52:14.680
 Value is the effort that goes into making something in the classical school.

52:14.680 --> 52:18.160
 Well, that's just one measure of objective.

52:18.160 --> 52:19.160
 Where do you fall?

52:19.160 --> 52:20.160
 Huh?

52:20.160 --> 52:21.160
 Where do you fall?

52:21.160 --> 52:22.160
 I fall on...

52:22.160 --> 52:25.640
 Subjective versus objective spectrum of value.

52:25.640 --> 52:30.440
 I think you have to have the capacity to move between one and the other in a structured

52:30.440 --> 52:31.440
 way.

52:31.440 --> 52:32.440
 The K model of value.

52:32.440 --> 52:35.120
 Yeah, well, my base model is the objective, okay?

52:35.120 --> 52:40.600
 But above that, as soon as you start talking, you said about the worker, for example, then

52:40.600 --> 52:48.480
 you get involved in the subjectivity, because a worker will be angry, and justifiably so,

52:48.480 --> 52:53.240
 about being treated as a commodity, because I'm not a commodity, I'm a human being, okay?

52:53.240 --> 52:58.400
 And that's where Marx saw political organization coming from.

52:58.400 --> 52:59.920
 And that's subjective now.

52:59.920 --> 53:05.160
 And then when you get to money itself, Marx actually said, well, what's the value of money?

53:05.160 --> 53:09.680
 Now if you use an objective theory of value, you would say, well, the value of money is

53:09.680 --> 53:11.520
 its cost of production.

53:11.520 --> 53:13.000
 What's the cost of producing a dollar?

53:13.000 --> 53:15.160
 It's about two cents.

53:15.160 --> 53:20.480
 So he said it can't be, the value of money cannot be its cost of production.

53:20.480 --> 53:25.240
 Or the most value, I think if I remember the phrase properly, is value here as it must

53:25.240 --> 53:33.200
 mean the, effectively, uncertain expectations or subjective valuation.

53:33.200 --> 53:35.000
 Uncertain expectations or subjective valuation.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.760
 Okay, but he's okay with that?

53:36.760 --> 53:40.200
 He was okay with that, because he could move between different levels, because he had a

53:40.200 --> 53:46.800
 structured foundation of this dialectical vision of foreground, background tension,

53:46.800 --> 53:52.400
 commodity, having use value, exchange value, and a gap between the two when you're talking

53:52.400 --> 53:56.200
 about machines, when you're buying stuff for production.

53:56.200 --> 54:00.680
 And then at the next level, he could look at workers, worker organization, and say that's

54:00.680 --> 54:04.940
 driven by being treated as a commodity when you're a noncommodity.

54:04.940 --> 54:13.600
 So the basic labor theory of value that is described to Karl Marx is that value at the

54:13.600 --> 54:19.960
 base layer fundamentally comes from the labor you put into something.

54:19.960 --> 54:26.080
 And you say, well, there's some deep truth there, except he misses one fundamental point,

54:26.080 --> 54:30.400
 which is machines can also bring value to the world.

54:30.400 --> 54:38.720
 He was saying they don't, the only thing that matters is human labor, not labor.

54:38.720 --> 54:45.120
 How do you measure what's the role of whatever value machines bring to the world?

54:45.120 --> 54:51.120
 This is another intriguing history, because Marx, when he first started, had what you

54:51.120 --> 54:57.600
 can call an exclusivist explanation for why labor created value.

54:57.600 --> 55:03.560
 And that was to say that labor is the only commodity with both what he called commodity

55:03.560 --> 55:04.880
 and commodity power.

55:04.880 --> 55:09.080
 So you have labor and labor power.

55:09.080 --> 55:13.960
 Labor is the, and I get fuzzy about this, I haven't read it for something like 30 years,

55:13.960 --> 55:17.000
 but labor has both commodity and commodity power.

55:17.000 --> 55:22.200
 The commodity is you can buy labor, which is the means of subsistence.

55:22.200 --> 55:25.280
 Labor power is the capacity to work inside a factory.

55:25.280 --> 55:29.680
 There's a difference between the two, therefore that difference will give rise to surplus.

55:29.680 --> 55:34.280
 And there's no other commodity that has this essence of commodity and commodity power.

55:34.280 --> 55:36.440
 So that was his exclusivist argument.

55:36.440 --> 55:44.920
 In the middle of 1857, he was visited by a guy called Otto Brau in his home in Chelsea.

55:44.920 --> 55:51.440
 And Otto returned to Marx a copy of Hegel's, I think it's called Phenomenology of Right,

55:51.440 --> 55:53.560
 I haven't read it, but that's the book.

55:53.560 --> 55:58.600
 And Marx was then at that stage reading through all the classical theorists again.

55:58.600 --> 56:01.360
 And he was, suddenly he read Hegel again.

56:01.360 --> 56:04.800
 And if you know Hunter S. Thompson, okay, okay.

56:04.800 --> 56:06.560
 Who doesn't know Hunter S. Thompson?

56:06.560 --> 56:08.040
 Somebody who hasn't had enough drugs, obviously.

56:08.040 --> 56:09.040
 Yeah.

56:09.040 --> 56:10.040
 But Hunter S. Thompson.

56:10.040 --> 56:12.280
 He comes to you in a dream after you take your first puff of...

56:12.280 --> 56:13.280
 Mescaline or...

56:13.280 --> 56:14.280
 Or whatever.

56:14.280 --> 56:15.280
 And of course, we've all...

56:15.280 --> 56:18.640
 If you know your drugs well enough, you can tell, okay, he's stoned, okay, he's on cocaine,

56:18.640 --> 56:19.640
 you know.

56:19.640 --> 56:24.080
 But suddenly, his writing style in the middle of a book called The Grundrisse completely

56:24.080 --> 56:25.080
 changed.

56:25.080 --> 56:26.080
 He switched from weed to cocaine.

56:26.080 --> 56:28.760
 He switched from Ricardo to Hegel, okay.

56:28.760 --> 56:33.280
 And what in Ricardo, he had this exclusivist argument about labor, and suddenly Hegel is

56:33.280 --> 56:38.480
 back talking in terms of dialectics, not actually using a word, but foreground and background

56:38.480 --> 56:40.220
 and tension.

56:40.220 --> 56:41.220
 And then he...

56:41.220 --> 56:46.000
 That's where this use value, exchange value, attention thing came from, is rereading Hegel

56:46.000 --> 56:51.960
 13 years after he stopped reading philosophy, because made in 44, he was reading just The

56:51.960 --> 56:52.960
 Economists.

56:52.960 --> 56:55.800
 So you're saying Karl Marx is human after all.

56:55.800 --> 56:56.800
 He's human.

56:56.800 --> 56:57.800
 He could be...

56:57.800 --> 56:58.800
 I would love to have a beer with Karl.

56:58.800 --> 56:59.800
 For a wine.

56:59.800 --> 57:00.800
 For Karl?

57:00.800 --> 57:01.800
 He's Karl to you?

57:01.800 --> 57:03.360
 He's Mr. Marx to me.

57:03.360 --> 57:04.360
 Hang on.

57:04.360 --> 57:06.960
 He'd be Karl to me, I'm afraid, after all these years.

57:06.960 --> 57:07.960
 Yeah, yeah.

57:07.960 --> 57:09.500
 You've had quite a journey together.

57:09.500 --> 57:15.560
 So that's where after Hegel, his interpretation of the dialectic comes in the form of background,

57:15.560 --> 57:16.560
 foreground, and background.

57:16.560 --> 57:21.440
 And then on page 267 of the Penguin edition of the Grundrisse.

57:21.440 --> 57:22.440
 What early?

57:22.440 --> 57:23.440
 Your memory...

57:23.440 --> 57:24.440
 One and a half pages long footnote.

57:24.440 --> 57:25.440
 It's pretty hard to forget.

57:25.440 --> 57:30.720
 Because when I did this, when I first read Marx way, way back when I was...

57:30.720 --> 57:31.720
 How old was I?

57:31.720 --> 57:32.720
 20.

57:32.720 --> 57:33.720
 Okay.

57:33.720 --> 57:38.560
 I tried to explain my explanation of Marx's use value, exchange value stuff to my colleagues

57:38.560 --> 57:43.240
 in this philosophy discussion room at Sydney University during a beautiful summer that

57:43.240 --> 57:47.400
 we were inside, concrete and sandstone walls discussing Marx.

57:47.400 --> 57:52.600
 And I went to say, look, the use value, exchange value argument can be applied to a machine.

57:52.600 --> 57:54.000
 What's the exchange value of a machine?

57:54.000 --> 57:55.680
 It's cost of manufacturing it.

57:55.680 --> 57:56.840
 What's its use value?

57:56.840 --> 57:59.800
 Its capacity to produce goods for sale.

57:59.800 --> 58:03.440
 No relation between the two, there'll be a gap, a machine can be a source of profit.

58:03.440 --> 58:07.760
 Now, I said that and I got laughed at and I quite literally laughed at.

58:07.760 --> 58:13.760
 So when I went back to university 13 years later to do my master's degree, I chose to

58:13.760 --> 58:18.640
 read through and find in Marx where he first came across this insight.

58:18.640 --> 58:24.960
 So my first master's thesis failed, by the way, and justifiably so.

58:24.960 --> 58:29.720
 I didn't know the level of academic discourse necessary.

58:29.720 --> 58:32.880
 I had an advisor who didn't understand what I was writing.

58:32.880 --> 58:39.480
 He got me to write for his New Keynesian audience and it was a mess and it got failed.

58:39.480 --> 58:40.480
 So I got rid of him.

58:40.480 --> 58:41.480
 Did it get failed?

58:41.480 --> 58:43.000
 Why do you think?

58:43.000 --> 58:44.280
 It wasn't a good thesis.

58:44.280 --> 58:46.400
 I didn't know the level.

58:46.400 --> 58:51.000
 It was written for an audience my supervisor thought that I should be writing for, and

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
 it was a mess.

58:52.000 --> 58:59.440
 And so I met another guy, Jeff Fishburne, as a lecturer at New South Wales University.

58:59.440 --> 59:00.840
 And Jeff was open minded.

59:00.840 --> 59:04.560
 He was not a conventional neoclassical thinker.

59:04.560 --> 59:09.720
 And I realized I'd throw out the half that Bill had got me to do, focused just on Marx.

59:09.720 --> 59:15.080
 And so I decided to read Marx in chronological sequence from his very first works of economics,

59:15.080 --> 59:18.880
 which are called the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844.

59:18.880 --> 59:23.760
 And he wrote those in a garret in Paris after he'd been expelled from Prussia.

59:23.760 --> 59:30.260
 And so he decided to read having been an expert on philosophy and regarded it as the towering

59:30.260 --> 59:36.380
 intellect of Hegelian philosophy in Prussia, but driven out because he was a radical.

59:36.380 --> 59:42.560
 He ended up running a newspaper or being writing for a newspaper, and he was reporting about

59:42.560 --> 59:47.840
 the eviction of peasants from the forests, taking away their feudal rights.

59:47.840 --> 59:53.040
 And so this is where his passion for economics and humanity came from.

59:53.040 --> 59:55.120
 And he was a poet as well.

59:55.120 --> 59:58.760
 I mean, he loved poetry to Jenny von Westhalen.

59:58.760 --> 1:00:01.880
 His first published works were pretty much in poetry.

1:00:01.880 --> 1:00:05.240
 He was a rouse about, he was a wild character.

1:00:05.240 --> 1:00:09.080
 We'd probably fight like crazy, I imagine, if we met.

1:00:09.080 --> 1:00:10.080
 Over the beers?

1:00:10.080 --> 1:00:16.760
 I'm slightly, even though I can be, I can get involved in an argument like nobody's

1:00:16.760 --> 1:00:17.760
 business.

1:00:17.760 --> 1:00:18.760
 No, really?

1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:19.760
 No, really.

1:00:19.760 --> 1:00:21.240
 But I'm a bit more peaceful of personality.

1:00:21.240 --> 1:00:23.240
 Oh, you think Marx is feistier than you?

1:00:23.240 --> 1:00:27.600
 He was feisty, but feisty with, he could be arrogant.

1:00:27.600 --> 1:00:31.680
 Like I've got an intellectual arrogance, I've come to accept that.

1:00:31.680 --> 1:00:33.920
 But there's like a fundamental humility to you.

1:00:33.920 --> 1:00:37.160
 You're saying Marx is like, has ego that's hard to control.

1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:38.160
 A bit too big ego, yeah.

1:00:38.160 --> 1:00:39.160
 I'm guessing.

1:00:39.160 --> 1:00:40.480
 I mean, I'm never going to meet him.

1:00:40.480 --> 1:00:42.320
 Well, the beard says ego to me.

1:00:42.320 --> 1:00:43.640
 The beard is huge, yeah.

1:00:43.640 --> 1:00:44.640
 That's huge.

1:00:44.640 --> 1:00:45.640
 Okay.

1:00:45.640 --> 1:00:46.640
 So this is interesting.

1:00:46.640 --> 1:00:51.000
 So you went chronologically right through his works, the development of the human being

1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:52.000
 through his works.

1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:53.000
 Yeah.

1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.440
 And I was trying to find the point at which he discovered this use value exchange value

1:00:55.440 --> 1:00:56.520
 idea.

1:00:56.520 --> 1:01:02.640
 And it occurs in a footnote on page 267 to 268 of the Penguin edition of the Guindrisa,

1:01:02.640 --> 1:01:07.440
 which his notes he was taking literally not meant for publication, literally sitting at

1:01:07.440 --> 1:01:13.800
 a stall inside the British Museum, I think, reading all the classical authors in chronological

1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:14.800
 sequence.

1:01:14.800 --> 1:01:19.680
 And then somebody throws Hegel at him, and suddenly he's talking in Hegelian terms.

1:01:19.680 --> 1:01:24.560
 And he suddenly says, is not, because it's whole value issues, what is value?

1:01:24.560 --> 1:01:26.120
 Is it exchange value, use value?

1:01:26.120 --> 1:01:27.440
 How do they relate to each other?

1:01:27.440 --> 1:01:28.440
 That's what he was thinking about.

1:01:28.440 --> 1:01:34.200
 And he said, is not use value, which was left out of the classical school, a fundamental

1:01:34.200 --> 1:01:36.320
 aspect of the commodity?

1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:39.880
 Is there not a tension between the use value and exchange value?

1:01:39.880 --> 1:01:44.680
 Just so we're clear in that context, use value is kind of the subjective thing, exchange

1:01:44.680 --> 1:01:45.680
 value is the objective thing.

1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:46.680
 Yeah.

1:01:46.680 --> 1:01:49.320
 And Marx was, found a way to integrate the two.

1:01:49.320 --> 1:01:57.000
 He was focused on labor being the only thing that can generate both the use value and the

1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:58.000
 exchange value.

1:01:58.000 --> 1:01:59.000
 But, no.

1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:03.600
 If you look at the classical school, they focus on exchange value, objective.

1:02:03.600 --> 1:02:09.280
 Look at the neoclassical, they focus upon use value, subjective, or they call it utility.

1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:14.920
 So Marx, coming from the Ricardian tradition, basically dismissed the role of utility.

1:02:14.920 --> 1:02:20.480
 And then when he reads Hegel, he's suddenly starting to think in terms of unities.

1:02:20.480 --> 1:02:24.680
 And exchange value and use value is the unity of the commodity.

1:02:24.680 --> 1:02:27.840
 And he thinks, well, I can't ignore use value.

1:02:27.840 --> 1:02:31.760
 So rather than leaving it out completely, which is what Ricardo and Smith does, I've

1:02:31.760 --> 1:02:32.920
 got to somehow bring it in.

1:02:32.920 --> 1:02:35.680
 And this Hegelian insight occurs to him.

1:02:35.680 --> 1:02:39.800
 And it's remarkable, I really recommend taking a look at the book, even just to look at that

1:02:39.800 --> 1:02:44.120
 particular page, because what it would have been, as shown as a footnote, but it would

1:02:44.120 --> 1:02:50.660
 have been him saying, oh, wow, and his asterisk, asterisk, is not use value, a fundamental

1:02:50.660 --> 1:02:53.480
 aspect of the unity of a commodity.

1:02:53.480 --> 1:02:57.640
 So in the notes, you see the discovery of an idea in the human mind, the integration

1:02:57.640 --> 1:02:58.640
 of an idea.

1:02:58.640 --> 1:02:59.640
 And it's beautiful.

1:02:59.640 --> 1:03:02.200
 And he actually writes, does this have significance in economics, question mark.

1:03:02.200 --> 1:03:06.760
 And then he probably went home that night, and that idea changed him.

1:03:06.760 --> 1:03:08.880
 Yeah, it changed him completely.

1:03:08.880 --> 1:03:11.120
 And from that point on, his writing was completely different.

1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:15.920
 But he still had this idea from the Ricardian days of saying that labor is the only source

1:03:15.920 --> 1:03:20.840
 of value, using an exclusive argument to say there's something unique about labor that

1:03:20.840 --> 1:03:22.640
 explains why it's a source of value.

1:03:22.640 --> 1:03:26.920
 But suddenly, this insight occurs to him, and he thinks, I can get a positive derivation.

1:03:26.920 --> 1:03:31.960
 I can use use value and exchange value and the fact they're not related to each other

1:03:31.960 --> 1:03:35.040
 as a dialectical tension to explain surplus value.

1:03:35.040 --> 1:03:36.040
 And that's what he does.

1:03:36.040 --> 1:03:41.720
 So he goes from a negative explanation of where value comes from to a positive explanation

1:03:41.720 --> 1:03:44.480
 on that page of the Guindarisa.

1:03:44.480 --> 1:03:49.460
 He then triumphantly uses it to explain why labor is a source of value.

1:03:49.460 --> 1:03:51.360
 You buy it for its exchange value.

1:03:51.360 --> 1:03:52.840
 You use its use value.

1:03:52.840 --> 1:03:53.840
 They're unrelated.

1:03:53.840 --> 1:03:55.100
 The use value will be bigger.

1:03:55.100 --> 1:03:56.820
 That's where profit comes from.

1:03:56.820 --> 1:04:01.200
 Then he does exactly the same thing for machinery, about 30 pages on.

1:04:01.200 --> 1:04:06.760
 He says it also has to be contemplated, which was not done before.

1:04:06.760 --> 1:04:09.320
 This is wrote nice to himself, by the way.

1:04:09.320 --> 1:04:14.800
 It's written really in a colloquial style, that the use value of a machine is significantly

1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:16.200
 greater than its exchange value.

1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:17.760
 He actually left out the word is.

1:04:17.760 --> 1:04:23.000
 It's used to be a translation into English of the German, I'm sure.

1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:24.000
 I don't know.

1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:25.000
 I haven't seen the original notes.

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:26.000
 I'd love to see them.

1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:29.200
 But he says, he leaves out the word is.

1:04:29.200 --> 1:04:34.720
 It also has to be contemplated that the use value is significantly greater than its exchange

1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:43.240
 value, i.e. that the contribution of the machine to production exceeds its depreciation.

1:04:43.240 --> 1:04:48.840
 That was an insight which undermined his explanation for revolution.

1:04:48.840 --> 1:04:49.840
 Okay.

1:04:49.840 --> 1:04:52.520
 Can you say that again?

1:04:52.520 --> 1:04:57.600
 The cost of production exceeds its depreciation?

1:04:57.600 --> 1:04:58.600
 Can you linger on that?

1:04:58.600 --> 1:05:02.640
 Well, what Marx argued, and you read this in Capital, and I read this in Capital when

1:05:02.640 --> 1:05:07.160
 I first saw the contradiction in his own thought.

1:05:07.160 --> 1:05:12.840
 He said that no matter how useful a machine is, whether it took a hundred hours to make

1:05:12.840 --> 1:05:22.680
 or cost 150 pounds, it cannot under any circumstances add more to production than 150 pounds, which

1:05:22.680 --> 1:05:31.520
 in his old exclusivist logic he could justify, and which in his post 1857 argument is bullshit.

1:05:31.520 --> 1:05:33.320
 Can you steel man his case?

1:05:33.320 --> 1:05:39.920
 Can we go to the mind of Marx and thinking if a machine costs a hundred bucks, it can't

1:05:39.920 --> 1:05:43.280
 be ever more, bring more value than a hundred bucks to the world?

1:05:43.280 --> 1:05:49.720
 But that contradicts his previous logic, because what he said is commodities are the essential

1:05:49.720 --> 1:05:52.400
 unity in capitalism.

1:05:52.400 --> 1:05:54.960
 Capitalism focuses upon the exchange value.

1:05:54.960 --> 1:05:59.840
 That pushes the use value into the background, and there's a tension between the two.

1:05:59.840 --> 1:06:04.200
 What that means is the exchange value of a commodity sets its price.

1:06:04.200 --> 1:06:06.580
 The use value is independent.

1:06:06.580 --> 1:06:07.960
 He called them incommensurable.

1:06:07.960 --> 1:06:13.360
 He literally used the word incommensurability between exchange value and a use value, whereas

1:06:13.360 --> 1:06:15.480
 neoclassicals make them commensurable.

1:06:15.480 --> 1:06:21.320
 So he's saying exchange value and use value incommensurable, and that normally means that

1:06:21.320 --> 1:06:25.240
 exchange value is objective, like the number of hours it takes to make something.

1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:30.240
 Use value is subjective, how comfortable the chair is, the fact that you can sit in a chair.

1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:35.320
 So that's incommensurability, but when you apply it in production, the exchange value

1:06:35.320 --> 1:06:36.800
 of something is objective.

1:06:36.800 --> 1:06:40.920
 It's how many hours it takes to make a machine or how many hours it takes to make the means

1:06:40.920 --> 1:06:42.720
 of subsistence for a worker.

1:06:42.720 --> 1:06:44.880
 The use value is also objective.

1:06:44.880 --> 1:06:49.700
 You're making commodities for sale, and the worker does six hours.

1:06:49.700 --> 1:06:55.920
 Six hours of work will make the means of subsistence for the worker, but the worker will work a

1:06:55.920 --> 1:06:59.640
 twelve hour day, and the six hours becomes a gap.

1:06:59.640 --> 1:07:05.000
 Now that's incommensurability between use value and exchange value of labor, but when

1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:09.840
 you look at what he said about no matter how long it takes to make a machine or how many

1:07:09.840 --> 1:07:15.280
 pounds it costs, he's saying they're identical, and that's contradicting his own logic.

1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:17.880
 Well, what's the use value of a machine?

1:07:17.880 --> 1:07:23.360
 The fact that it can produce goods for sale, exactly the same as the worker.

1:07:23.360 --> 1:07:30.280
 Now in my modern reinterpretation of Marx, which brings in my work on energy, I see both

1:07:30.280 --> 1:07:36.800
 labor and machinery as a means to harness energy and produce useful work, and they can

1:07:36.800 --> 1:07:37.800
 both do that.

1:07:37.800 --> 1:07:39.400
 In fact, they do it together.

1:07:39.400 --> 1:07:40.680
 It's a collective enterprise.

1:07:40.680 --> 1:07:44.360
 Okay, so, and we'll go to that.

1:07:44.360 --> 1:07:48.820
 So there's no fundamental difference from an exchange value and use value perspective

1:07:48.820 --> 1:07:50.280
 between a human and a machine.

1:07:50.280 --> 1:07:54.160
 And therefore, they're using the same logic that can both be a source of surplus, which

1:07:54.160 --> 1:08:00.040
 is what Marx contradicted because his explanation for where socialism would come from is that

1:08:00.040 --> 1:08:03.000
 only profit comes from, like profit comes only from labor.

1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:08.160
 Over time, we'll add more machinery than labor that will mean a falling rate of profit and

1:08:08.160 --> 1:08:11.120
 therefore a tendency towards socialism.

1:08:11.120 --> 1:08:16.580
 And what he did in that insight in 1857 is contradict his own idea about what would lead

1:08:16.580 --> 1:08:19.600
 to socialism, and he couldn't cope with it.

1:08:19.600 --> 1:08:30.280
 Okay, what's the difference between Marxian economics and Marxist political ideology?

1:08:30.280 --> 1:08:34.520
 The gap between the two, the overlap, the differences, what?

1:08:34.520 --> 1:08:39.360
 The real foundation of Marx's political philosophy was the economic argument that there would

1:08:39.360 --> 1:08:42.880
 be a tendency for the rate of profit to fall.

1:08:42.880 --> 1:08:48.520
 And that tendency for the rate of profit to fall would lead to capitalists battening down

1:08:48.520 --> 1:08:55.720
 on workers harder, paying them less than their subsistence, a revolt by workers against this,

1:08:55.720 --> 1:08:58.420
 and then you would get socialism on the other side.

1:08:58.420 --> 1:09:03.920
 So what he called the tendency for the rate of profit to fall played a critical role in

1:09:03.920 --> 1:09:07.080
 his explanation for why socialism would have to come about.

1:09:07.080 --> 1:09:13.000
 He was saying it would have to come about, or is it a good thing for it to come about?

1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:16.620
 He had a should, but he was trying to say it must.

1:09:16.620 --> 1:09:22.720
 So if you look at Marx in the history of radical thought, he was preceded by what were called

1:09:22.720 --> 1:09:24.440
 utopian socialists.

1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:30.040
 Saint Simon, even the Cadbury's company came out of utopian socialist, and they had an

1:09:30.040 --> 1:09:34.400
 idea about a perfect society in the future where people were properly rewarded, were

1:09:34.400 --> 1:09:38.400
 treated as human beings rather than cogs in a machine and all this sort of stuff.

1:09:38.400 --> 1:09:42.840
 And they said socialism should come about because it treats humans better than capitalism

1:09:42.840 --> 1:09:43.840
 does.

1:09:43.840 --> 1:09:47.660
 Marx said, I can prove that socialism must come about.

1:09:47.660 --> 1:09:53.280
 So he preferred, he had a utopian vision of a future society, but he thought he could

1:09:53.280 --> 1:09:55.080
 prove that it had to come about.

1:09:55.080 --> 1:10:01.720
 And the proof relied critically upon tendency for the rate of profit to fall, and that relied

1:10:01.720 --> 1:10:06.040
 upon labor being the only source of profit.

1:10:06.040 --> 1:10:07.800
 What was his utopian view?

1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:13.160
 So this idea from each according to his ability to each according to his needs.

1:10:13.160 --> 1:10:16.000
 Is that the utopian?

1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:21.080
 I think it's utopian in the context of our modern world.

1:10:21.080 --> 1:10:27.520
 It says that rather than being rewarded, like Jeff Bezos gets enormous fortune, you get

1:10:27.520 --> 1:10:32.280
 what you need, not what you want, necessarily.

1:10:32.280 --> 1:10:33.680
 All needs is fulfilled.

1:10:33.680 --> 1:10:38.280
 It was a vision of utopia where you could be a fisherman in the morning, a poet in

1:10:38.280 --> 1:10:43.820
 the afternoon, and a chef at night, this paraphrasing one of his phrases.

1:10:43.820 --> 1:10:48.480
 So he did have a utopian vision of a future society, and he did think human creativity

1:10:48.480 --> 1:10:52.320
 would be much, much greater under socialism than it was under capitalism.

1:10:52.320 --> 1:10:54.400
 He was wrong.

1:10:54.400 --> 1:10:57.120
 So let's explore in different ways where he was wrong.

1:10:57.120 --> 1:11:04.360
 You're saying there's a fundamental flaw in the logic, but also if we can explore high

1:11:04.360 --> 1:11:10.120
 level philosophical concepts of socialism too, like the dreams of a utopia.

1:11:10.120 --> 1:11:14.800
 So first of all, what is socialism?

1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:17.640
 That's another loaded term.

1:11:17.640 --> 1:11:19.800
 Socialism particularly in America is a very loaded term.

1:11:19.800 --> 1:11:26.480
 What Americans call socialist is a large amount of provision of services by the state, which

1:11:26.480 --> 1:11:28.280
 is commonplace in Europe.

1:11:28.280 --> 1:11:34.360
 It's still moderately commonplace in my own home country of Australia.

1:11:34.360 --> 1:11:38.700
 And that Americans will call public education socialist.

1:11:38.700 --> 1:11:42.360
 It's a total parody of the word.

1:11:42.360 --> 1:11:46.920
 Strictly speaking, what socialism meant is the public ownership of the means of production,

1:11:46.920 --> 1:11:49.900
 no private ownership of the means of production.

1:11:49.900 --> 1:11:51.680
 What is the means of production?

1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:52.680
 Machine factories.

1:11:52.680 --> 1:11:53.680
 Factories.

1:11:53.680 --> 1:11:59.920
 So all the goods that are produced in factories, no, the means of producing the goods is owned

1:11:59.920 --> 1:12:01.680
 by a centralized entity.

1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:02.680
 Yeah.

1:12:02.680 --> 1:12:03.680
 Centrally planned.

1:12:03.680 --> 1:12:07.640
 This is what actually was done under Gold's plan under the Soviets.

1:12:07.640 --> 1:12:09.880
 And even with the collective farms as well.

1:12:09.880 --> 1:12:11.520
 You no longer own your land.

1:12:11.520 --> 1:12:13.420
 The state owns the land.

1:12:13.420 --> 1:12:15.200
 You worked on the land.

1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:16.680
 And this was supposed to be a utopia.

1:12:16.680 --> 1:12:19.400
 Now it didn't turn out to be one.

1:12:19.400 --> 1:12:23.480
 And we'll talk about maybe your ideas of why it didn't turn out to be one.

1:12:23.480 --> 1:12:25.880
 So the fascists did the same.

1:12:25.880 --> 1:12:28.120
 So is this fascism also central?

1:12:28.120 --> 1:12:31.120
 Fascism, so called national socialism.

1:12:31.120 --> 1:12:32.680
 It's also a kind of socialism.

1:12:32.680 --> 1:12:36.840
 So yeah, but there was no, it wasn't a public owner, there was public direction.

1:12:36.840 --> 1:12:40.760
 So the state would tell factories what to do, but there's still a private profit.

1:12:40.760 --> 1:12:44.900
 And a large part of why the Nazis succeeded was the extent to which they managed to coopt

1:12:44.900 --> 1:12:47.680
 major manufacturers in Germany.

1:12:47.680 --> 1:12:50.240
 So it's, you know.

1:12:50.240 --> 1:12:51.240
 Direction versus ownership.

1:12:51.240 --> 1:12:52.240
 Yeah.

1:12:52.240 --> 1:12:56.520
 A dictatorial, I mean, that's a very particular implementation.

1:12:56.520 --> 1:13:01.120
 So you have to consider the full details of the implementation, but it's basically dictator

1:13:01.120 --> 1:13:02.120
 guided.

1:13:02.120 --> 1:13:03.120
 Yeah.

1:13:03.120 --> 1:13:09.200
 And if you want to take a proper vision, then you have to say it's the ownership of the

1:13:09.200 --> 1:13:11.280
 means of production by the state.

1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:12.280
 Okay.

1:13:12.280 --> 1:13:14.100
 Versus the ownership by private.

1:13:14.100 --> 1:13:16.700
 That rules out the Nazi period.

1:13:16.700 --> 1:13:22.520
 Use the word that, again, they're bastardizing as much as Americans do in the opposite direction.

1:13:22.520 --> 1:13:26.840
 Well, what does ownership exactly mean?

1:13:26.840 --> 1:13:31.080
 Well, it became incredibly complicated.

1:13:31.080 --> 1:13:36.680
 And this is actually the best work on this is done by recently deceased Hungarian economist

1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:38.680
 called Janos Kornai.

1:13:38.680 --> 1:13:42.880
 And Kornai tried to explain why socialism failed.

1:13:42.880 --> 1:13:45.320
 Because why did socialism fail in your view?

1:13:45.320 --> 1:13:47.360
 In his view, in Janos's view, in your view.

1:13:47.360 --> 1:13:49.600
 I think Janos is 100% correct.

1:13:49.600 --> 1:13:53.860
 It's a brilliant piece of work, so I'm going to be really paraphrasing his view.

1:13:53.860 --> 1:13:59.560
 And he imagined an ideal socialist society, and there wasn't a Stalin, there weren't

1:13:59.560 --> 1:14:04.440
 purges, and you lived up to all the ideals that Marx had for socialism.

1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:09.440
 So he said, but you do it in a context of an economy which is incredibly primitive,

1:14:09.440 --> 1:14:10.440
 Russia.

1:14:10.440 --> 1:14:11.440
 Okay?

1:14:11.440 --> 1:14:13.360
 Because if you look at Marx's own vision of the revolution, it was going to happen

1:14:13.360 --> 1:14:15.420
 in England.

1:14:15.420 --> 1:14:18.920
 The advanced economies would be first to go through the revolution.

1:14:18.920 --> 1:14:23.420
 The socialist, the primitive economies would have to go through a capitalist transition.

1:14:23.420 --> 1:14:26.740
 And this is the difference between the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks.

1:14:26.740 --> 1:14:30.780
 So the Mensheviks, when Hyman Minsky came out of the Menshevik family, the Mensheviks

1:14:30.780 --> 1:14:33.360
 believed you had to go through a capitalist phase.

1:14:33.360 --> 1:14:36.600
 Russia had to go through a capitalist period before it becomes socialist.

1:14:36.600 --> 1:14:42.360
 The Bolsheviks believed they could get there in one go, bypass the capitalist phase, do

1:14:42.360 --> 1:14:47.240
 the development under socialism rather than under capitalism.

1:14:47.240 --> 1:14:50.040
 And this is what Yanis was actually analyzing.

1:14:50.040 --> 1:14:57.120
 You start from a primitive feudal economy, very little industrialization, and you want

1:14:57.120 --> 1:15:04.560
 to jump to an advanced industrial society from that foundation.

1:15:04.560 --> 1:15:10.080
 So he said what you have then for is a whole range of industries, all of which need as

1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:12.880
 much resources as you can get for them.

1:15:12.880 --> 1:15:19.680
 So you want to develop agriculture, mining, industry, every little division of it.

1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:24.300
 They all have legitimate demands on the resources of the country and the state.

1:15:24.300 --> 1:15:29.320
 That means that all your resources are fully employed and are probably over employed.

1:15:29.320 --> 1:15:33.020
 So you have a resource constraint in that society.

1:15:33.020 --> 1:15:38.720
 The easiest way to cope with a resource constraint is to produce last year's commodity, not to

1:15:38.720 --> 1:15:40.840
 innovate, not to make change.

1:15:40.840 --> 1:15:46.140
 So what they will give you is as you start to add, you invest so you now have the beginnings

1:15:46.140 --> 1:15:51.160
 of a steel industry, beginnings of a car industry, and so on, you start investing, but you continue

1:15:51.160 --> 1:15:54.560
 producing the same product you made last year.

1:15:54.560 --> 1:15:59.040
 And I have a perfect personal example of that, which I'll throw in now if you like a pretty

1:15:59.040 --> 1:16:00.040
 heavy conversation.

1:16:00.040 --> 1:16:08.000
 I know my first major girlfriend had a brother who wanted to get a motorbike, but he couldn't

1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:11.320
 afford a Honda or a Kawasaki.

1:16:11.320 --> 1:16:17.000
 At the time, they cost about $3,000 for a 650 cc Japanese motorbike.

1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:23.440
 He found he could buy a Cossack for $650, $1 per cc.

1:16:23.440 --> 1:16:30.320
 So I was there when he got this is in suburban Sylvania waters in Sydney.

1:16:30.320 --> 1:16:35.320
 So this crate arrives with a Cossack motorbike inside it.

1:16:35.320 --> 1:16:38.840
 So we take it apart, it's then got all these wooden palings, we have to pull off the wooden

1:16:38.840 --> 1:16:40.400
 palings to open it up.

1:16:40.400 --> 1:16:44.780
 Then there's oil soaked rag over this thing, which is tied on a wooden base.

1:16:44.780 --> 1:16:50.560
 We take the oil soaked rag off and we stare in all its glory in a 1942 BMW.

1:16:50.560 --> 1:16:55.200
 It was exactly the same as Steve McQueen in The Great Escape.

1:16:55.200 --> 1:16:59.320
 So the Russians for 30 years were making the same bloody motorbike.

1:16:59.320 --> 1:17:02.440
 It had a bicycle seat.

1:17:02.440 --> 1:17:03.960
 And that's how they cope.

1:17:03.960 --> 1:17:06.200
 They've just made the same damn machine every year.

1:17:06.200 --> 1:17:09.240
 And he said, so that's the outcome.

1:17:09.240 --> 1:17:10.920
 You actually want the best possible world.

1:17:10.920 --> 1:17:13.080
 You're trying to build as fast as possible.

1:17:13.080 --> 1:17:16.480
 You're paying workers as high wages as you possibly can.

1:17:16.480 --> 1:17:19.360
 And that leads to a world where you don't innovate.

1:17:19.360 --> 1:17:24.640
 But he said capitalism, on the other hand, pure capitalist economy, you're trying to

1:17:24.640 --> 1:17:26.940
 pay workers as little as possible.

1:17:26.940 --> 1:17:28.560
 You have competitive industries.

1:17:28.560 --> 1:17:31.280
 You're trying to take demand away from your rivals.

1:17:31.280 --> 1:17:37.360
 You have Kawasaki versus Honda versus BMW, et cetera, et cetera.

1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:41.780
 The way you get demand away from your competitors is by innovating.

1:17:41.780 --> 1:17:46.200
 So what you will get is cycles and booms and slumps, but you'll innovate and change over

1:17:46.200 --> 1:17:47.200
 time.

1:17:47.200 --> 1:17:52.880
 So what you find was this huge gap between socialist volume production with no innovation

1:17:52.880 --> 1:17:55.860
 and capitalism with innovation.

1:17:55.860 --> 1:18:02.200
 So that was the fundamental failing that Janos Korneis saw, so why did socialism not innovate?

1:18:02.200 --> 1:18:08.600
 Because if you go back to this famous historical incident with Khrushchev in the United Nations,

1:18:08.600 --> 1:18:12.420
 bangs Texophe Shewan, bangs the desk, says, we will bury you.

1:18:12.420 --> 1:18:15.200
 He literally meant we're going to bury you in commodities.

1:18:15.200 --> 1:18:17.580
 We're going to produce more output than you are.

1:18:17.580 --> 1:18:19.920
 And he was wrong.

1:18:19.920 --> 1:18:25.480
 Because fundamentally, in the long term, to bury somebody in commodity production, you

1:18:25.480 --> 1:18:26.480
 have to innovate.

1:18:26.480 --> 1:18:27.480
 Yeah.

1:18:27.480 --> 1:18:33.680
 And there's also another remarkable Soviet engineer who was given the job of interpreting

1:18:33.680 --> 1:18:36.560
 Marx's ideas of industrial sectors.

1:18:36.560 --> 1:18:42.640
 So he had the commodity sphere, the industry sphere, sector one, sector two, sector three.

1:18:42.640 --> 1:18:46.060
 Sector one producing consumer goods, sector two producing capital goods, sector three

1:18:46.060 --> 1:18:49.000
 producing luxury goods for capitalists.

1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:53.160
 And so he had a three sector model of the economy, and he was talking about the dynamics

1:18:53.160 --> 1:18:54.600
 between them.

1:18:54.600 --> 1:18:59.040
 And what Feldman did was reinterpret this as an engineer would reinterpret it, which

1:18:59.040 --> 1:19:00.920
 was brilliant work.

1:19:00.920 --> 1:19:05.520
 So what he said was, you need to produce the means of production.

1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:09.920
 If you want to grow quickly, you focus on producing the means of production rather than

1:19:09.920 --> 1:19:10.920
 commodities.

1:19:10.920 --> 1:19:13.080
 So you don't make cars, you make car factories.

1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:14.080
 Okay?

1:19:14.080 --> 1:19:17.480
 You make a few cars, but most of the effort goes into expanding how many factories you

1:19:17.480 --> 1:19:18.480
 have.

1:19:18.480 --> 1:19:21.880
 And what he did was do a mathematical model where you start off with very low levels of

1:19:21.880 --> 1:19:24.960
 consumer good output, but then you would just go exponential.

1:19:24.960 --> 1:19:25.960
 Okay?

1:19:25.960 --> 1:19:29.520
 Now, I took a look at that back when I was doing my master's degree.

1:19:29.520 --> 1:19:35.960
 And the training in mathematics, I took Feldman's equations and then looked at what was actually

1:19:35.960 --> 1:19:40.960
 driving it was he was imagining correctly a huge pool of unemployed labor.

1:19:40.960 --> 1:19:46.280
 If you go back to the earliest stages of Soviet industrialization back in 1917, post the Second

1:19:46.280 --> 1:19:50.520
 World, post the First World War, you had all these unemployed workers, you had all these

1:19:50.520 --> 1:19:53.540
 peasants you could take off the land and put into factories.

1:19:53.540 --> 1:19:57.240
 So you had a huge supply of workers.

1:19:57.240 --> 1:19:59.200
 What you had to do was build the factories.

1:19:59.200 --> 1:20:06.280
 See building the factories, but at a certain point you exhaust the supply of lowly employed

1:20:06.280 --> 1:20:07.940
 or unemployed labor.

1:20:07.940 --> 1:20:12.920
 And so rather than having this exponential takeoff, you hit a ceiling and then you can

1:20:12.920 --> 1:20:16.800
 only grow as fast as the population because you're not innovating.

1:20:16.800 --> 1:20:20.340
 So that's what actually hit the Soviet system.

1:20:20.340 --> 1:20:23.880
 And it's why they never buried the Western consumer goods.

1:20:23.880 --> 1:20:28.860
 And instead why Western consumers looked in envy at the goods being purchased by their

1:20:28.860 --> 1:20:33.920
 Western people and said, if that's exploitation, we want exploitation.

1:20:33.920 --> 1:20:40.620
 So okay, there's a lot of interesting stuff to ask here, which is, so Marx's vision for

1:20:40.620 --> 1:20:48.000
 the socialist utopia is you have to go through capitalism.

1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:50.520
 The Mensheviks were true to Marx's original idea.

1:20:50.520 --> 1:20:57.560
 So is there a case to be made that in the long arc of human history on like human civilization

1:20:57.560 --> 1:21:05.480
 on earth that we're going to live out Marx's vision for utopia, which is like, will we

1:21:05.480 --> 1:21:07.320
 run into a wall with capitalism?

1:21:07.320 --> 1:21:09.200
 I think we are running into a wall with capitalism.

1:21:09.200 --> 1:21:11.800
 In fact, I think we've already gone through the wall and we haven't yet realized we've

1:21:11.800 --> 1:21:16.240
 smashed our skulls.

1:21:16.240 --> 1:21:22.360
 But on the other side, we're bleeding and everything like that.

1:21:22.360 --> 1:21:26.480
 Does Marx have any insights on what the other side of capitalism, what is beyond capitalism?

1:21:26.480 --> 1:21:30.680
 I think that beautiful phrase of from each according to his ability to each according

1:21:30.680 --> 1:21:36.140
 to his needs describes what we should end up with.

1:21:36.140 --> 1:21:40.580
 And I think that's actually, if I think about, you know, I'm an Elon Musk fan.

1:21:40.580 --> 1:21:45.160
 That's what I think is partially going to be the nature of society if we build one that

1:21:45.160 --> 1:21:47.240
 functions on Mars.

1:21:47.240 --> 1:21:52.460
 Because and I've actually seen the interview with the Italian who's involved in designing

1:21:52.460 --> 1:21:54.800
 what the future colony will look like.

1:21:54.800 --> 1:22:00.320
 He was actually asked this question, can there be enormous inequality in Martian civilization?

1:22:00.320 --> 1:22:02.440
 The guy said, absolutely not.

1:22:02.440 --> 1:22:06.080
 Because the resources, again, resource constraint applies.

1:22:06.080 --> 1:22:11.560
 You simply can't give somebody underground bunker 100 times the size of somebody else's

1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:14.920
 100 underground bunker.

1:22:14.920 --> 1:22:22.240
 Because the scarcity of resources imposes a need for equality overall.

1:22:22.240 --> 1:22:23.240
 Is that always?

1:22:23.240 --> 1:22:24.240
 That's interesting.

1:22:24.240 --> 1:22:28.200
 I mean, the scarcity of resources, wait, but I feel like that's a contradiction.

1:22:28.200 --> 1:22:29.200
 I thought.

1:22:29.200 --> 1:22:32.120
 Are you thinking neoclassical about scarcity?

1:22:32.120 --> 1:22:37.480
 I'm barely thinking at all.

1:22:37.480 --> 1:22:44.120
 So wait, I thought scarcity, the best way to build on top of scarcity is a capitalist

1:22:44.120 --> 1:22:45.120
 type of machine.

1:22:45.120 --> 1:22:50.400
 No, this is where, again, our vision of what scarcity is, is wrong.

1:22:50.400 --> 1:22:54.480
 Because and Ricardo said this, but it's actually better than Marx.

1:22:54.480 --> 1:23:00.240
 Because Ricardo said, there are some products whose value is determined entirely by their

1:23:00.240 --> 1:23:01.240
 scarcity.

1:23:01.240 --> 1:23:02.240
 Yeah.

1:23:02.240 --> 1:23:08.040
 Paintings, rare wines, et cetera, et cetera, they are things you cannot reproduce in a

1:23:08.040 --> 1:23:09.040
 factory.

1:23:09.040 --> 1:23:12.780
 He said, the essence of capitalism is what you can make in a factory.

1:23:12.780 --> 1:23:19.960
 And therefore, for these unique objects, these rare objects, Picasso painting a beautiful

1:23:19.960 --> 1:23:25.860
 bottle of wine, et cetera, et cetera, then the utility, it can't be reproduced easily.

1:23:25.860 --> 1:23:28.520
 So its price will be determined by subjective valuation.

1:23:28.520 --> 1:23:33.160
 He said, what we're talking about in capitalism is the stuff you can make en masse.

1:23:33.160 --> 1:23:37.680
 And that is the true focus of the capitalist economy.

1:23:37.680 --> 1:23:39.040
 And that is not about scarcity.

1:23:39.040 --> 1:23:43.920
 That is about, the only scarcity applies when you don't have the resources to make them

1:23:43.920 --> 1:23:48.880
 anymore or you can't use the energy involved because you'll damage the biosphere too much,

1:23:48.880 --> 1:23:50.800
 which we've already done.

1:23:50.800 --> 1:23:55.880
 But fundamentally, the scarcity that neoclassicals have been able to think about and Austrians

1:23:55.880 --> 1:23:59.040
 think about as well is nonreproducible.

1:23:59.040 --> 1:24:03.140
 But the essence of capitalism is the commodity, the backscratcher, the two buck backscratcher,

1:24:03.140 --> 1:24:06.920
 anybody can, you know, the cheapest chips to make, and that's why it can make a profit

1:24:06.920 --> 1:24:09.020
 out of them.

1:24:09.020 --> 1:24:13.460
 Not the elaborate gold thing with diamonds and rubies that only the king gets.

1:24:13.460 --> 1:24:19.600
 So we think our vision of scarcity has been perverted by neoclassicals analyzing the exception

1:24:19.600 --> 1:24:22.200
 to capitalism and calling it capitalism.

1:24:22.200 --> 1:24:23.200
 Okay.

1:24:23.200 --> 1:24:24.200
 Fair enough.

1:24:24.200 --> 1:24:29.720
 So, you know, let's put Mars aside because I think there's a lot of strange factors that

1:24:29.720 --> 1:24:37.360
 have to do with a whole nother planet, civilization, that we don't quite understand.

1:24:37.360 --> 1:24:47.120
 Think how economics works with different geographic locations, one of which have new challenges,

1:24:47.120 --> 1:24:48.200
 which is what essentially this is.

1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:50.800
 I don't know if you can apply the same economic theory.

1:24:50.800 --> 1:24:55.560
 No, I'm saying your question, I think we'll be forced into that ultimately by having to

1:24:55.560 --> 1:24:58.380
 make a compromise with the ecology.

1:24:58.380 --> 1:25:02.080
 And we've been ruthless about the ecology of this planet, and we're going to pay the

1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:03.660
 price for it.

1:25:03.660 --> 1:25:11.520
 So if you have a planet where you can't be ruthless, okay, you have to mind it as carefully

1:25:11.520 --> 1:25:19.000
 as possible, then that utopian might be imposed upon you for the needs for survival on that

1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:20.000
 planet.

1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:25.520
 Back here, Marx's utopia was still the one that ignored the ecology.

1:25:25.520 --> 1:25:31.740
 And I think if I have a vision of a utopia in future, it's got bugger all to do about

1:25:31.740 --> 1:25:34.120
 what humans get out of it.

1:25:34.120 --> 1:25:36.280
 It's what humans respect.

1:25:36.280 --> 1:25:38.040
 They have to respect life.

1:25:38.040 --> 1:25:44.940
 So I see that as a one eyed utopia, a utopia for a single species, as if it can exist on

1:25:44.940 --> 1:25:47.800
 its own, which we should know it can't.

1:25:47.800 --> 1:25:48.800
 Quick bathroom break?

1:25:48.800 --> 1:25:51.340
 Yeah, that would be great.

1:25:51.340 --> 1:25:54.520
 We took a little bit of a break and now we're back.

1:25:54.520 --> 1:25:58.600
 We needed to take a break because my brain broke and I'm piecing it back together.

1:25:58.600 --> 1:26:02.240
 You mentioned ecology and life and the value of all of that.

1:26:02.240 --> 1:26:05.080
 We'll return to it if we can.

1:26:05.080 --> 1:26:16.320
 But first, we said why this kind of, this idea of why socialism failed, can we linger

1:26:16.320 --> 1:26:23.520
 on this a little bit longer in how did the ideas of Karl Marx lead to Stalinism?

1:26:23.520 --> 1:26:31.800
 So this particular implementation, is there something fundamental to these ideas that

1:26:31.800 --> 1:26:36.720
 leads to a dictator and that leads to atrocities?

1:26:36.720 --> 1:26:43.680
 There's something about the mechanism of the bureaucracy that's built that leads to a human

1:26:43.680 --> 1:26:53.480
 being that's able to attain, integrate absolute power and then start abusing that power?

1:26:53.480 --> 1:26:54.480
 All that kind of stuff.

1:26:54.480 --> 1:27:00.560
 Like some of the history of the 20th century, is that inextricably connected to the ideas

1:27:00.560 --> 1:27:01.560
 of Karl Marx?

1:27:01.560 --> 1:27:05.240
 I think to some extent it is, but I'm going to also say that if it hadn't been for the

1:27:05.240 --> 1:27:09.880
 Bolsheviks interpreting Marx and saying we can reach socialism without going through

1:27:09.880 --> 1:27:15.480
 capitalism, then it might not have happened.

1:27:15.480 --> 1:27:22.120
 So if you look at the, like the Mensheviks were a rival political group in Russia and

1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:24.680
 that's where Hyman Minsky, who's a huge inspiration for me.

1:27:24.680 --> 1:27:29.440
 So he's an economist who was maybe, can we take a little attention, who was Hyman Minsky?

1:27:29.440 --> 1:27:30.440
 Yeah.

1:27:30.440 --> 1:27:36.600
 Hyman Minsky was the person who developed an analysis of capitalism based on financial

1:27:36.600 --> 1:27:38.520
 instability.

1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:45.720
 And he was actually the PhD student of Joseph Schumpeter and an Austrian economist as well

1:27:45.720 --> 1:27:48.900
 whose name I've forgotten temporarily.

1:27:48.900 --> 1:27:57.640
 And he asked him, his parents were both refugees from Russia during the Stalinist period because

1:27:57.640 --> 1:28:05.240
 the Mensheviks were being wiped out in Russia, just like any other opponents to the Bolsheviks

1:28:05.240 --> 1:28:06.960
 were being eliminated.

1:28:06.960 --> 1:28:12.960
 So I think his parents met in Chicago, still remain socialist, still remain politically

1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:20.800
 active, and he was educated in a family that was just imbued with Marx as his vision.

1:28:20.800 --> 1:28:27.880
 He ended up fighting in the Second World War on the American side, coming back to America

1:28:27.880 --> 1:28:34.640
 and studying mathematics and then also doing an economics degree leading to a PhD.

1:28:34.640 --> 1:28:39.400
 And the question he posed for himself is what causes Great Depressions?

1:28:39.400 --> 1:28:44.840
 And he put it beautifully, he said, can it happen again, it being the Great Depression?

1:28:44.840 --> 1:28:50.560
 And if it can't happen, then what has changed between the society before the First and Second

1:28:50.560 --> 1:28:54.120
 World War and after that makes a depression impossible?

1:28:54.120 --> 1:28:56.440
 What's the answer to those two questions?

1:28:56.440 --> 1:28:57.440
 Can it happen again?

1:28:57.440 --> 1:29:02.520
 His answer was yes, it can happen again, but what has prevented it happening by the time

1:29:02.520 --> 1:29:10.000
 he started writing about it, which was the late 50s to the mid 80s, late 80s.

1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:11.840
 We met once, but only once.

1:29:11.840 --> 1:29:13.520
 Over a beer?

1:29:13.520 --> 1:29:14.520
 Over a beer?

1:29:14.520 --> 1:29:18.800
 No, he gave a seminar at New South Uni and he's a bit of an obstreperous bastard.

1:29:18.800 --> 1:29:19.800
 What?

1:29:19.800 --> 1:29:20.800
 A stripper?

1:29:20.800 --> 1:29:21.800
 Obstreperous.

1:29:21.800 --> 1:29:22.800
 Wow.

1:29:22.800 --> 1:29:23.800
 What is it?

1:29:23.800 --> 1:29:26.520
 It means argumentative and likely to dismiss you.

1:29:26.520 --> 1:29:29.880
 So like a good mate of mine was the guy who brought him out to Australia, a guy called

1:29:29.880 --> 1:29:30.880
 Graham White.

1:29:30.880 --> 1:29:31.880
 G'day, Graham.

1:29:31.880 --> 1:29:32.880
 We're still good mates.

1:29:32.880 --> 1:29:33.880
 G'day, Graham.

1:29:33.880 --> 1:29:35.800
 I love your language and your accent.

1:29:35.800 --> 1:29:36.800
 It's a great...

1:29:36.800 --> 1:29:40.520
 Actually, there's a really good TikTok I saw earlier today with an Aboriginal guy saying

1:29:40.520 --> 1:29:43.400
 he loves the Australian language because it's absolutely ironic.

1:29:43.400 --> 1:29:47.560
 You ask an Australian a question and he'll give you an answer, which is the opposite

1:29:47.560 --> 1:29:50.080
 of what he means, and you've got to work out the rest for yourself.

1:29:50.080 --> 1:29:51.080
 Yeah.

1:29:51.080 --> 1:29:53.200
 So he goes up to another Aboriginal mate and says, G'day, mate.

1:29:53.200 --> 1:29:54.200
 He says, how are you?

1:29:54.200 --> 1:29:55.200
 Oh, not bad.

1:29:55.200 --> 1:29:56.200
 What have you been doing recently?

1:29:56.200 --> 1:29:57.200
 Oh, not much.

1:29:57.200 --> 1:29:58.200
 When are we going?

1:29:58.200 --> 1:29:59.200
 Not too far?

1:29:59.200 --> 1:30:00.200
 Not too soon?

1:30:00.200 --> 1:30:01.200
 Yeah.

1:30:01.200 --> 1:30:02.200
 Where is it?

1:30:02.200 --> 1:30:03.200
 Oh, not too far away?

1:30:03.200 --> 1:30:04.200
 Yeah.

1:30:04.200 --> 1:30:05.200
 All negatives.

1:30:05.200 --> 1:30:07.200
 And he's a beautiful, beautiful rendition.

1:30:07.200 --> 1:30:08.200
 Yeah.

1:30:08.200 --> 1:30:10.760
 Yeah, that's the cool thing about the internet culture.

1:30:10.760 --> 1:30:13.360
 They appreciate that ironic side.

1:30:13.360 --> 1:30:17.480
 Like for example, the best compliment you can give as an Aboriginal to somebody else

1:30:17.480 --> 1:30:18.480
 is that's deadly.

1:30:18.480 --> 1:30:19.480
 That's deadly.

1:30:19.480 --> 1:30:20.480
 That's a compliment.

1:30:20.480 --> 1:30:21.480
 That's deadly.

1:30:21.480 --> 1:30:22.480
 Okay.

1:30:22.480 --> 1:30:23.480
 Yeah.

1:30:23.480 --> 1:30:24.480
 I've got another mate of mine and this comes to the Australian language.

1:30:24.480 --> 1:30:26.480
 If I call you a bastard, that's a compliment.

1:30:26.480 --> 1:30:27.480
 Yeah.

1:30:27.480 --> 1:30:29.480
 Depending on how I insinuate the word bastard.

1:30:29.480 --> 1:30:30.480
 Bastard.

1:30:30.480 --> 1:30:31.480
 Bastard.

1:30:31.480 --> 1:30:32.480
 Bastard.

1:30:32.480 --> 1:30:33.480
 That's deadly.

1:30:33.480 --> 1:30:34.480
 Yeah.

1:30:34.480 --> 1:30:35.480
 I love that.

1:30:35.480 --> 1:30:40.480
 And there's something, unfortunately, there's something about the British accent that makes

1:30:40.480 --> 1:30:47.840
 people sound maybe brilliant, maybe sophisticated, wise.

1:30:47.840 --> 1:30:48.840
 But actually pompous.

1:30:48.840 --> 1:30:49.840
 Yeah.

1:30:49.840 --> 1:30:55.760
 No, that's unfortunately the downside of that is you can sound pompous.

1:30:55.760 --> 1:31:03.200
 There's something about the Australian accent that you just can't sound brilliant.

1:31:03.200 --> 1:31:04.400
 It humbles you.

1:31:04.400 --> 1:31:06.720
 You sound like you're having a lot of fun.

1:31:06.720 --> 1:31:07.720
 There's wit.

1:31:07.720 --> 1:31:08.720
 There's all that good stuff.

1:31:08.720 --> 1:31:09.720
 Yeah.

1:31:09.720 --> 1:31:10.720
 Yeah.

1:31:10.720 --> 1:31:13.720
 But you just can't be like Karl Marx in an Australian accent would just not come off.

1:31:13.720 --> 1:31:14.720
 That is a very good point.

1:31:14.720 --> 1:31:16.200
 He would not be able to pull off the beard.

1:31:16.200 --> 1:31:17.200
 That's like, yeah.

1:31:17.200 --> 1:31:18.640
 I mean, I just, yeah.

1:31:18.640 --> 1:31:25.740
 It's fascinating that the accent determines something about the person.

1:31:25.740 --> 1:31:27.640
 Maybe it's the chicken and the egg too.

1:31:27.640 --> 1:31:29.640
 It drives the way of the discourse.

1:31:29.640 --> 1:31:30.640
 Obviously there's a lot of brilliance.

1:31:30.640 --> 1:31:33.920
 There's a lot of brilliance in your work, but it sounds like you're always having fun.

1:31:33.920 --> 1:31:34.920
 Yeah.

1:31:34.920 --> 1:31:38.280
 And look, this, Pat Poncho has got a lot of Australian mates here.

1:31:38.280 --> 1:31:39.280
 Yeah.

1:31:39.280 --> 1:31:41.280
 He spent, what about, how long in Australia?

1:31:41.280 --> 1:31:42.280
 Year and a half.

1:31:42.280 --> 1:31:43.280
 Year and a half.

1:31:43.280 --> 1:31:46.040
 And he's got all these mates here who play Aussie rules football in Austin.

1:31:46.040 --> 1:31:47.240
 You should join them one day.

1:31:47.240 --> 1:31:48.240
 I will.

1:31:48.240 --> 1:31:50.520
 It's actually, it's a very creative sport.

1:31:50.520 --> 1:31:51.520
 It's much more fun.

1:31:51.520 --> 1:31:52.520
 It's different than rugby?

1:31:52.520 --> 1:31:53.520
 Oh, very.

1:31:53.520 --> 1:31:54.520
 Rugby is hopeless.

1:31:54.520 --> 1:31:58.640
 Rugby is two morons smashing their bodies against each other.

1:31:58.640 --> 1:31:59.640
 Easy now.

1:31:59.640 --> 1:32:00.640
 Easy now.

1:32:00.640 --> 1:32:01.640
 Sorry.

1:32:01.640 --> 1:32:02.640
 Sorry.

1:32:02.640 --> 1:32:04.280
 We did not mean to offend the rugby fans in the audience.

1:32:04.280 --> 1:32:05.280
 Well, okay.

1:32:05.280 --> 1:32:07.520
 What's, so it's too simplistic.

1:32:07.520 --> 1:32:08.520
 It's too simplistic.

1:32:08.520 --> 1:32:09.520
 It's easy.

1:32:09.520 --> 1:32:10.520
 It's, I mean, there's skill in it.

1:32:10.520 --> 1:32:14.400
 I've seen some really skillful rugby union and rugby league players in my day.

1:32:14.400 --> 1:32:15.400
 Yeah.

1:32:15.400 --> 1:32:18.360
 But it, fundamentally, if you hit somebody hard enough, they go down.

1:32:18.360 --> 1:32:19.360
 Yeah.

1:32:19.360 --> 1:32:20.360
 Okay.

1:32:20.360 --> 1:32:23.520
 Whereas in Aussie rules, it's about catching the ball and then kicking the ball and pass.

1:32:23.520 --> 1:32:24.520
 More skill, less pass.

1:32:24.520 --> 1:32:25.520
 More skill.

1:32:25.520 --> 1:32:31.080
 And it's, and the bodies of the athletes, I can actually get off and measure what a sport

1:32:31.080 --> 1:32:33.040
 is like by the bodies it creates.

1:32:33.040 --> 1:32:39.040
 And you get these incredibly elegant lithe muscular forms out of Aussie rules.

1:32:39.040 --> 1:32:42.960
 Such beautiful words you have in your vocabulary, lithe, I don't even know.

1:32:42.960 --> 1:32:47.480
 But I'll assume you know what it means and maybe somebody in the audience.

1:32:47.480 --> 1:32:48.480
 Okay.

1:32:48.480 --> 1:32:51.160
 So, all right, fine, fine.

1:32:51.160 --> 1:32:58.320
 We should also mention that you, in your youth, you know, like last year, have had Olympic

1:32:58.320 --> 1:33:01.080
 weightlifting as part of your life.

1:33:01.080 --> 1:33:02.080
 So you're...

1:33:02.080 --> 1:33:03.080
 A long time ago.

1:33:03.080 --> 1:33:04.080
 And like you said, tennis.

1:33:04.080 --> 1:33:06.240
 I also played tennis for many, many, many, many years.

1:33:06.240 --> 1:33:07.240
 Okay.

1:33:07.240 --> 1:33:08.240
 Yeah.

1:33:08.240 --> 1:33:09.240
 It's a fascinating game.

1:33:09.240 --> 1:33:10.240
 It's a wonderful game.

1:33:10.240 --> 1:33:11.240
 Yeah.

1:33:11.240 --> 1:33:15.560
 That's my favorite game.

1:33:15.560 --> 1:33:17.680
 Karl Marx and Stalin.

1:33:17.680 --> 1:33:18.680
 Yeah.

1:33:18.680 --> 1:33:22.840
 So how do we get onto Aussie football in Australia and the accent?

1:33:22.840 --> 1:33:27.280
 I'm not really sure you talked about the way I said something about Karl Marx and with

1:33:27.280 --> 1:33:28.280
 Karl Marx.

1:33:28.280 --> 1:33:29.280
 Anyway, we got there.

1:33:29.280 --> 1:33:30.280
 Yeah.

1:33:30.280 --> 1:33:31.560
 We got there and now we return.

1:33:31.560 --> 1:33:32.560
 But back to Marx.

1:33:32.560 --> 1:33:33.560
 I think...

1:33:33.560 --> 1:33:34.560
 It's not the destination.

1:33:34.560 --> 1:33:35.560
 It's the journey.

1:33:35.560 --> 1:33:40.280
 I think Marx, the failure of socialism with Janos Kornei captured beautifully.

1:33:40.280 --> 1:33:44.800
 This idea already called demand constrained versus resource constrained economies.

1:33:44.800 --> 1:33:47.800
 And capitalism is demand constrained.

1:33:47.800 --> 1:33:48.800
 Okay.

1:33:48.800 --> 1:33:52.560
 And this is, again, where neoclassical theory is completely wrong, empirically completely

1:33:52.560 --> 1:33:53.560
 wrong.

1:33:53.560 --> 1:33:58.040
 So the neoclassicals have a vision of capitalism being resource constrained, and it's about

1:33:58.040 --> 1:34:02.680
 maximizing your usage of resources subject to constraints.

1:34:02.680 --> 1:34:05.440
 And as Kornei said, that's really what happened to socialism.

1:34:05.440 --> 1:34:12.760
 What happens under capitalism is that you have 15, 20 companies producing automobiles.

1:34:12.760 --> 1:34:15.680
 They are all trying to capture as much of the market as they can.

1:34:15.680 --> 1:34:20.840
 If you add up their marketing plans, you're going to get 120, 130% of the actual market.

1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:23.080
 So they're all going to have excess capacity.

1:34:23.080 --> 1:34:27.080
 When you build a factory, you're building it with a plan for it to exist for five, 10,

1:34:27.080 --> 1:34:28.080
 15 years.

1:34:28.080 --> 1:34:30.420
 You have to have excess capacity in the factory.

1:34:30.420 --> 1:34:35.560
 So that means that capitalism has far greater productive capacity than it actually uses.

1:34:35.560 --> 1:34:39.640
 And then the way that you manage to get demand into your factories to innovate and produce

1:34:39.640 --> 1:34:44.480
 something nobody else does, or you're producing in volume and when somebody produces like

1:34:44.480 --> 1:34:49.240
 a bung tire, comes out of Firestone, then Goodyear is ready to expand its production

1:34:49.240 --> 1:34:50.940
 and take advantage of that.

1:34:50.940 --> 1:34:54.360
 So that's the actual nature of competition in capitalism.

1:34:54.360 --> 1:34:59.240
 And that means that we get a cornucopia of goods, even if we're lowly workers.

1:34:59.240 --> 1:35:05.040
 The variety of goods in capitalism is overwhelming, and that just doesn't happen in socialism.

1:35:05.040 --> 1:35:09.040
 You get your 1942 Cossack as your motorbike, that's it.

1:35:09.040 --> 1:35:13.640
 When you put your money down to buy a refrigerator, it'll arrive in 10 years because the factory's

1:35:13.640 --> 1:35:15.640
 already fully constrained.

1:35:15.640 --> 1:35:21.480
 So all these resource constraints mean that people aren't happy under socialism.

1:35:21.480 --> 1:35:26.600
 And if you've got a whole bunch of people that aren't happy, then the best way to control

1:35:26.600 --> 1:35:29.020
 them is to suppress them.

1:35:29.020 --> 1:35:33.040
 So I think in that sense, ultimately, yes, it does lead to something like Stalinism.

1:35:33.040 --> 1:35:36.480
 So it's easier to give happy people freedom.

1:35:36.480 --> 1:35:39.600
 Yeah, I mean, happy people get pretty silly outside.

1:35:39.600 --> 1:35:43.800
 I'm not particularly, the extent to which Americans overuse and distort the word freedom

1:35:43.800 --> 1:35:47.680
 drives me balmy.

1:35:47.680 --> 1:35:52.800
 All of these words can be distorted, but they all, at the core, have some fundamental power

1:35:52.800 --> 1:35:57.620
 and beauty, and then we just distort on the surface for the fun of it, just to start battles

1:35:57.620 --> 1:35:59.160
 on Twitter and so on.

1:35:59.160 --> 1:36:02.880
 But what citizens of the Soviet world didn't feel was freedom.

1:36:02.880 --> 1:36:06.400
 Not just in, first of all, it wasn't freedom to buy commodities.

1:36:06.400 --> 1:36:09.640
 The commodities that were supposed to be on the shops weren't there.

1:36:09.640 --> 1:36:11.440
 The volume couldn't be produced.

1:36:11.440 --> 1:36:15.720
 And what you then got out of that as well was the classic Soviet joke, they pretend

1:36:15.720 --> 1:36:17.520
 to pay us and we pretend to work.

1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:18.520
 Okay.

1:36:18.520 --> 1:36:20.320
 Yeah, so you're not motivated.

1:36:20.320 --> 1:36:26.120
 Oh, look, I went to Cuba about eight years ago, invited to give a talk there.

1:36:26.120 --> 1:36:28.920
 And staying in a hotel itself, the hotel's a story.

1:36:28.920 --> 1:36:33.700
 There was one day my meetings were canceled, so I thought I might go down to the beach.

1:36:33.700 --> 1:36:38.120
 And in the hotel, they had a wing, which is the tourist office, and there were three women

1:36:38.120 --> 1:36:39.120
 working inside the office.

1:36:39.120 --> 1:36:42.720
 So I thought I'd just go up and ask them, you know, how do I get to the beach?

1:36:42.720 --> 1:36:48.640
 And one of them says to me, and I stood there, just stood in the room, waiting to see if

1:36:48.640 --> 1:36:50.560
 they'd make eye contact with me.

1:36:50.560 --> 1:36:52.760
 Three women, nobody else in the place.

1:36:52.760 --> 1:36:53.760
 None of them looked at me.

1:36:53.760 --> 1:36:57.640
 So I finally went up to one of them and said, I want to go to the beach and do some surfing

1:36:57.640 --> 1:36:58.640
 work.

1:36:58.640 --> 1:36:59.640
 She said, I can get a taxi outside.

1:36:59.640 --> 1:37:05.600
 Now, fundamentally, she was saying, well, I'm being paid shit money here, I don't want

1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:13.080
 to work, I'm not going to do anything apart from sit here and qualify for my time.

1:37:13.080 --> 1:37:16.640
 And as much as there are reasons the Cubans have suffered from American embargoes and

1:37:16.640 --> 1:37:22.360
 all that sort of stuff, you've still got that fundamental shortage economy that Cornet spoke

1:37:22.360 --> 1:37:27.880
 about coming out of the structure of central ownership and central control of distribution

1:37:27.880 --> 1:37:28.880
 and investment.

1:37:28.880 --> 1:37:35.000
 It breaks my heart because I think some of the effects of that persist throughout time.

1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:36.600
 It become part of the culture too.

1:37:36.600 --> 1:37:37.600
 Yeah.

1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:38.600
 Yeah.

1:37:38.600 --> 1:37:39.600
 It's very interesting.

1:37:39.600 --> 1:37:40.600
 Negative culture.

1:37:40.600 --> 1:37:41.600
 Yeah.

1:37:41.600 --> 1:37:42.600
 Yeah.

1:37:42.600 --> 1:37:43.600
 Well, from the Western perspective.

1:37:43.600 --> 1:37:44.720
 Well, even from the people living through it.

1:37:44.720 --> 1:37:49.400
 I mean, I had enough conversation with Cubans, you know, meeting them on the street, hopping

1:37:49.400 --> 1:37:50.400
 in a cab.

1:37:50.400 --> 1:37:55.600
 There was one guy I was talking to, he was an industrial chemist and he'd got a bit of

1:37:55.600 --> 1:37:59.840
 money being a cab driver because he could make money out of taking foreign tourists

1:37:59.840 --> 1:38:01.560
 from the airport to the city.

1:38:01.560 --> 1:38:06.480
 By the way, this episode is brought to you by delicious Coca Cola.

1:38:06.480 --> 1:38:10.520
 That's why I didn't want to have it on camera, but anyway.

1:38:10.520 --> 1:38:12.000
 No, maybe they'll actually sponsor.

1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:16.120
 You want to make sure you rotate the label to show, this is capitalism.

1:38:16.120 --> 1:38:18.400
 What are we talking about here?

1:38:18.400 --> 1:38:19.400
 Even though it's red.

1:38:19.400 --> 1:38:24.280
 Red and black is actually anarchist.

1:38:24.280 --> 1:38:27.240
 I should tell you, I don't know if you know who Michael Malice is.

1:38:27.240 --> 1:38:28.240
 Michael.

1:38:28.240 --> 1:38:29.240
 Michael Malice.

1:38:29.240 --> 1:38:30.880
 He's an anarchist and he lives next door.

1:38:30.880 --> 1:38:31.880
 Does he?

1:38:31.880 --> 1:38:32.880
 Okay.

1:38:32.880 --> 1:38:34.920
 Now, I've lost touch with anarchist philosophy.

1:38:34.920 --> 1:38:40.560
 I actually used to read, you know, Kropotkin and Bakunin and so on, and I enjoyed their

1:38:40.560 --> 1:38:44.800
 philosophy and then I helped organize an anarchist conference once, and that was the

1:38:44.800 --> 1:38:48.440
 biggest antidote possible to being an anarchist.

1:38:48.440 --> 1:38:53.480
 That sounds like an entry point to a joke, helped to organize an anarchist party.

1:38:53.480 --> 1:38:54.480
 It is.

1:38:54.480 --> 1:38:59.520
 I mean, we literally spent three days arguing over whether there should or should not be

1:38:59.520 --> 1:39:01.880
 a chairperson for conversations.

1:39:01.880 --> 1:39:02.880
 Yeah.

1:39:02.880 --> 1:39:07.080
 Well, that may be that.

1:39:07.080 --> 1:39:12.880
 Monty Python's Life of Brian lived out live.

1:39:12.880 --> 1:39:15.160
 Look at the bright side of life.

1:39:15.160 --> 1:39:16.160
 All right.

1:39:16.160 --> 1:39:20.680
 So part of that explains why, for example, even to this day, in some of those parts of

1:39:20.680 --> 1:39:26.480
 the world, entrepreneurship does not flourish.

1:39:26.480 --> 1:39:30.720
 There's not a spirit in the people to start businesses, to launch new endeavors and all

1:39:30.720 --> 1:39:33.560
 those kinds of things.

1:39:33.560 --> 1:39:40.560
 We're just taking all kinds of strange little strolls, but how do you explain the mechanisms

1:39:40.560 --> 1:39:47.720
 of China today, where there's quite a bit of sort of flourishing of businesses and so

1:39:47.720 --> 1:39:48.720
 on?

1:39:48.720 --> 1:39:51.240
 It's a very peculiar kind of entrepreneurship.

1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:57.200
 They got away from central control, but they still manage central political control, but

1:39:57.200 --> 1:39:59.360
 diversified economic control.

1:39:59.360 --> 1:40:03.280
 So you could, it is possible to draw a line between politics and economics.

1:40:03.280 --> 1:40:06.560
 It is possible, and I think in some ways, China's more likely to survive as a society

1:40:06.560 --> 1:40:12.360
 going into the future than Western capitalist societies are.

1:40:12.360 --> 1:40:22.440
 So it's like, if we do the Karl Marx, the foreground and the background, you can centralize

1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:31.200
 the politics, the humanity, the subjective stuff, and then distribute the objective stuff.

1:40:31.200 --> 1:40:38.040
 You've got to have the goods, and the big change from Mao Zedong Xiaoping was the characterizing

1:40:38.040 --> 1:40:41.880
 that little saying that I don't care whether you have a black cat or a white cat, so long

1:40:41.880 --> 1:40:44.000
 as it catches mice.

1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:49.360
 And there was a level of pragmatism to the Deng Xiaoping revolution over Mao and Madame

1:40:49.360 --> 1:40:55.280
 Mao in particular, and that was manifest in the desire to get as much of those Western

1:40:55.280 --> 1:40:56.960
 goods as possible.

1:40:56.960 --> 1:41:01.320
 And I was actually in China in 1981, took a group of journalists there, as I mentioned

1:41:01.320 --> 1:41:07.920
 earlier, for a tour, and we ended up going to the Sichuan Free Trade Zone, and that gave

1:41:07.920 --> 1:41:15.280
 us an idea of why China was going to succeed, because they had a rule that you couldn't

1:41:15.280 --> 1:41:20.440
 just come in and exploit the cheap wages, you had to also have a Chinese partner, and

1:41:20.440 --> 1:41:25.240
 within five years, the Chinese partner had to earn 50 percent of the business, which

1:41:25.240 --> 1:41:26.240
 is huge.

1:41:26.240 --> 1:41:30.480
 And that gives you an idea of the reduction in wages these American corporations were

1:41:30.480 --> 1:41:31.480
 looking at.

1:41:31.480 --> 1:41:35.380
 They'd shut down the factory in what's now the Rust Belt of America that might be paying

1:41:35.380 --> 1:41:41.360
 somebody there at that time maybe $2 an hour, and they come across to China and they're

1:41:41.360 --> 1:41:43.560
 paying two cents an hour.

1:41:43.560 --> 1:41:49.160
 So the enormous amount of wages that they dropped, they were willing to forego half

1:41:49.160 --> 1:41:52.200
 the profits and the ownership of the firm.

1:41:52.200 --> 1:41:57.360
 So what the Chinese were doing wasn't just exploiting their labor force, it was also

1:41:57.360 --> 1:42:02.400
 building a capitalist class, and that meant that you had this, that's where all the Chinese

1:42:02.400 --> 1:42:04.280
 corporations have come from.

1:42:04.280 --> 1:42:11.240
 So they were building a capitalist system within a socialist command political system,

1:42:11.240 --> 1:42:14.440
 and that worked, and it's still working.

1:42:14.440 --> 1:42:18.320
 So there was the centralization of the economic stuff, the Gosplan approach.

1:42:18.320 --> 1:42:21.920
 I think that was where the Soviets failed.

1:42:21.920 --> 1:42:26.760
 And what the Chinese realized after what they went through under Mao was you have to have

1:42:26.760 --> 1:42:31.060
 that capitalist period, but they weren't going to abandon the communist control politically

1:42:31.060 --> 1:42:33.060
 of the country at the same time.

1:42:33.060 --> 1:42:36.280
 And that worked out brilliantly, and there's a huge amount of innovation taking place in

1:42:36.280 --> 1:42:38.160
 China today.

1:42:38.160 --> 1:42:44.480
 And they also will do gigantic infrastructure projects, breathtaking planning going into

1:42:44.480 --> 1:42:45.480
 that.

1:42:45.480 --> 1:42:49.620
 You would have seen videos of building a skyscraper in a day.

1:42:49.620 --> 1:42:54.280
 The planning that has to go into that, the pre preparation that's necessary is enormous.

1:42:54.280 --> 1:42:57.480
 So there's a real respect for engineers as well in that society, which does not apply

1:42:57.480 --> 1:42:58.480
 on the West.

1:42:58.480 --> 1:43:04.760
 What do you think about, from the Western perspective, the destructive effects of centralized

1:43:04.760 --> 1:43:09.880
 control of the populace, of the ideas of the discourse, of the censorship and the surveillance,

1:43:09.880 --> 1:43:10.880
 all those kinds of things?

1:43:10.880 --> 1:43:16.520
 It's a bit like we were talking about Russia to some extent beforehand, with centralized

1:43:16.520 --> 1:43:21.040
 versus decentralized corruption.

1:43:21.040 --> 1:43:27.200
 And when you had the centralized political stuff, it means you know you can't criticize

1:43:27.200 --> 1:43:28.600
 within China.

1:43:28.600 --> 1:43:31.760
 But so long as you don't criticize, you can do what you like.

1:43:31.760 --> 1:43:35.160
 And how destructive is that to the human spirit?

1:43:35.160 --> 1:43:39.200
 From the American perspective, that feels destructive.

1:43:39.200 --> 1:43:45.260
 I've been to China quite a few times over my life, a lot in the last, not for about

1:43:45.260 --> 1:43:48.960
 four years, but for the six years before that, a few visits.

1:43:48.960 --> 1:43:55.680
 And staying in second and third and fourth tier cities, so populations of only four million

1:43:55.680 --> 1:43:59.080
 people, which is quite small on Chinese standards.

1:43:59.080 --> 1:44:02.240
 And I had a lot of happy people that I was interacting with.

1:44:02.240 --> 1:44:06.400
 My girlfriend at the time, her social circle.

1:44:06.400 --> 1:44:09.800
 And you can feel when people can't discuss a political issue.

1:44:09.800 --> 1:44:13.040
 For example, in Thailand, you can't discuss the king.

1:44:13.040 --> 1:44:18.480
 They still have, you know, les majestes laws, so you can actually be jailed for discussing

1:44:18.480 --> 1:44:19.480
 the king.

1:44:19.480 --> 1:44:24.280
 And you can feel that to some extent, and it is a political issue in Thailand now.

1:44:24.280 --> 1:44:31.080
 But in China, what I got back from most people, it was a bit like a benevolent big brother.

1:44:31.080 --> 1:44:34.760
 But then when you get things out like the lockdown, which was applied recently, then

1:44:34.760 --> 1:44:40.940
 you get the failings of the Soviet system is still there in the Chinese system.

1:44:40.940 --> 1:44:47.680
 In that, the easiest way to avoid criticism as an underling carrying out instructions

1:44:47.680 --> 1:44:54.200
 of people above you is to carry those instructions out to the letter beyond what the people actually

1:44:54.200 --> 1:44:56.120
 want you to do at the top.

1:44:56.120 --> 1:45:00.320
 So we had a classic illustration of that when I took these journalists.

1:45:00.320 --> 1:45:06.220
 There was a news report saying that China's output of light industry had grown by 17 percent

1:45:06.220 --> 1:45:10.240
 in the previous year, but heavy industry had fallen by 7 percent.

1:45:10.240 --> 1:45:12.560
 We just don't compute.

1:45:12.560 --> 1:45:14.460
 So we kept on asking, why did this happen?

1:45:14.460 --> 1:45:18.400
 Every time we asked a question, this is back in 1981, the answer would be the initial answer,

1:45:18.400 --> 1:45:23.380
 we followed the directive of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

1:45:23.380 --> 1:45:26.220
 We finally got a guy to elaborate and say what that was.

1:45:26.220 --> 1:45:30.580
 He said, well, the Central Committee sent out a directive to promote light industry.

1:45:30.580 --> 1:45:31.800
 So what did you do?

1:45:31.800 --> 1:45:37.620
 Quote unquote, we stripped heavy industry factories and turned them into light industry.

1:45:37.620 --> 1:45:40.400
 Now that's destructive of everything.

1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:44.360
 And that's the overlay that you've still got sitting over the top of China.

1:45:44.360 --> 1:45:50.920
 But a huge part of the industrialization was simply saying, produce whatever you can, make

1:45:50.920 --> 1:45:53.580
 goods, market them, sell them.

1:45:53.580 --> 1:45:59.760
 And you get that innovative component of humanity is respected and the goods turn up and everybody's

1:45:59.760 --> 1:46:00.760
 well fed.

1:46:00.760 --> 1:46:04.600
 Food in Russia is far better than food in America.

1:46:04.600 --> 1:46:12.600
 So in terms of material satisfaction and freedom, for example, enjoy dancing.

1:46:12.600 --> 1:46:19.080
 We went to, I think, somewhere in Shanghai, and there's this line of people involving

1:46:19.080 --> 1:46:24.440
 a woman who would have been close to her 90s and a kid who was about six or four.

1:46:24.440 --> 1:46:25.440
 Partying it up?

1:46:25.440 --> 1:46:27.840
 Partying it up in the open air and doing this Chinese collective dance.

1:46:27.840 --> 1:46:31.520
 You have to be really careful about that kind of thing.

1:46:31.520 --> 1:46:44.640
 So in terms of measuring the flourishing of a people by looking at their happiness, I

1:46:44.640 --> 1:46:48.480
 have so many thoughts on this, but I'm imagining North Korea.

1:46:48.480 --> 1:46:55.720
 And if you talk to people in North Korea, I think they would say they're happy.

1:46:55.720 --> 1:46:56.720
 No.

1:46:56.720 --> 1:47:04.280
 Well, let me try to complete this argument, not an argument, but a sort of challenge to

1:47:04.280 --> 1:47:12.720
 your thought, which especially in the bigger cities, because they don't know the alternative.

1:47:12.720 --> 1:47:14.520
 So what else do you need?

1:47:14.520 --> 1:47:16.520
 There's enough food on the table.

1:47:16.520 --> 1:47:22.280
 We have a leader that loves us and we love him.

1:47:22.280 --> 1:47:24.360
 Our hearts are full of love.

1:47:24.360 --> 1:47:33.580
 Our table is full of food, they would say, because it's enough food.

1:47:33.580 --> 1:47:34.720
 What else do you want from life?

1:47:34.720 --> 1:47:36.360
 No, I think, okay, like that's...

1:47:36.360 --> 1:47:38.160
 So let me sort of chat, because like...

1:47:38.160 --> 1:47:39.160
 That's an alternative.

1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:41.580
 I mean, I've spent time in Romania.

1:47:41.580 --> 1:47:44.240
 So let me sort of complete that, sorry.

1:47:44.240 --> 1:47:47.520
 Because I'm taking the most challenging aspect.

1:47:47.520 --> 1:47:53.600
 When there's centralized control of information, that you don't know the alternative, that

1:47:53.600 --> 1:47:57.000
 you don't know how green the grass is on the other side.

1:47:57.000 --> 1:48:00.960
 And so your idea of happiness might be very constrained.

1:48:00.960 --> 1:48:06.680
 So you could also argue that is happiness, if you don't know.

1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:07.680
 Ignorance is bliss.

1:48:07.680 --> 1:48:08.680
 Ignorance is bliss.

1:48:08.680 --> 1:48:13.800
 And then so is happiness really the correct measure for the flourishing?

1:48:13.800 --> 1:48:14.800
 It's not.

1:48:14.800 --> 1:48:22.560
 But I mean, there's actually a classic book, a movie as well, called Mao's Last Dancer.

1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:28.720
 And that is a young man explaining his progression from being a dancer in the Cultural Revolution

1:48:28.720 --> 1:48:33.720
 through to a leading dancer in American and ultimately Australian ballet.

1:48:33.720 --> 1:48:39.200
 And he explicitly says at one point that he's told that the Chinese people have the highest

1:48:39.200 --> 1:48:41.120
 standard of living in the world.

1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:44.680
 And the reaction of him and his kids, like his fellow six year olds, is, God, it must

1:48:44.680 --> 1:48:47.440
 be miserable elsewhere in the world then.

1:48:47.440 --> 1:48:48.440
 So they knew.

1:48:48.440 --> 1:48:49.440
 They still know.

1:48:49.440 --> 1:48:50.440
 They still know.

1:48:50.440 --> 1:48:52.620
 There's no such thing as that complete ignorance.

1:48:52.620 --> 1:49:01.120
 But what I'm talking about is experiences in China say back in about 2016, 2014, there

1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:07.360
 was a feeling of freedom within limits that you didn't want to transgress because the

1:49:07.360 --> 1:49:09.360
 system was working.

1:49:09.360 --> 1:49:13.240
 So if you like, it's kind of like marriage, it's kind of like marriage, hey, that's a

1:49:13.240 --> 1:49:14.240
 good example.

1:49:14.240 --> 1:49:15.240
 There's limits.

1:49:15.240 --> 1:49:16.240
 There's limits.

1:49:16.240 --> 1:49:18.000
 You can have fun within those limits.

1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:19.000
 That's right.

1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:20.000
 Okay.

1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:24.160
 And people did have fun and they did feel free, but they didn't want to go and get divorced.

1:49:24.160 --> 1:49:30.040
 But that dilemma was accommodated because the boundaries, until you started hitting

1:49:30.040 --> 1:49:32.240
 restrictions were wide.

1:49:32.240 --> 1:49:33.240
 Okay.

1:49:33.240 --> 1:49:37.000
 And like when you look at it, I mean, look at the, again, with the Chinese Communist

1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:43.240
 Party, the administrators of that are often highly qualified engineers who can then make

1:49:43.240 --> 1:49:47.720
 intelligent decisions about what should be done as infrastructure and so on.

1:49:47.720 --> 1:49:54.520
 And you go to China and you've got incredible high speed rail, fantastic infrastructure,

1:49:54.520 --> 1:49:59.800
 internet, telecommunications and so on, rapidly evolving solar.

1:49:59.800 --> 1:50:06.240
 There's a range of things there that are so well done that reflect the fact that the selection

1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:11.600
 process that gives you your political elite is partially focused upon sucking up, et cetera,

1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:12.600
 et cetera.

1:50:12.600 --> 1:50:16.840
 It's still there, but it's also focused upon your skill levels.

1:50:16.840 --> 1:50:20.560
 And you get people making decisions who damn well know what they're talking about.

1:50:20.560 --> 1:50:25.000
 Like Australia's got a classic example, the internet in Australia sucks.

1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:31.840
 The reason it sucks is that the Labour Party, which is our version of the Democrats, was

1:50:31.840 --> 1:50:34.560
 in control during the global financial crisis.

1:50:34.560 --> 1:50:41.600
 And as part of that, they wanted to bring in optical fiber connections to the house.

1:50:41.600 --> 1:50:48.400
 So you'd have an optical fiber backbone and an optical fiber right to your T100 output

1:50:48.400 --> 1:50:49.760
 from your home.

1:50:49.760 --> 1:50:54.360
 And the Liberal Party fought that and said, that's going to be too expensive, it'd take

1:50:54.360 --> 1:50:55.700
 too long to do.

1:50:55.700 --> 1:51:01.240
 We're going to do cable to the node and then have a copper network linking from a node

1:51:01.240 --> 1:51:03.520
 on a street to all the houses in the street.

1:51:03.520 --> 1:51:07.040
 It's going to be cheaper and faster, have it more soon, blah, blah, blah.

1:51:07.040 --> 1:51:09.840
 It was a total technical fuck up.

1:51:09.840 --> 1:51:13.880
 And Australia now has internet that's about 50 or 60 years fast in the world.

1:51:13.880 --> 1:51:16.040
 It's dreadful for the internet.

1:51:16.040 --> 1:51:22.880
 Two political figures made that decision, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull, rivals and

1:51:22.880 --> 1:51:27.880
 leaders of the Conservative Party we call Liberal over there.

1:51:27.880 --> 1:51:34.560
 Now that was shitty decisions that wouldn't happen in a country like China because you've

1:51:34.560 --> 1:51:36.720
 got actual engineers making the decisions.

1:51:36.720 --> 1:51:42.360
 They say you can't get decent speed if you link optical fiber to copper.

1:51:42.360 --> 1:51:48.400
 So what you get is even though you can't make the decisions yourself, a vast majority of

1:51:48.400 --> 1:51:52.320
 the decisions are made intelligently and therefore you expect it.

1:51:52.320 --> 1:51:59.240
 It's interesting, but don't you worry about the corrupting aspects of power?

1:51:59.240 --> 1:52:00.240
 Oh yeah.

1:52:00.240 --> 1:52:05.000
 That you start, you know, you have engineers making intelligent decisions, but at which

1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:11.640
 point does the fat king start saying, oh, these engineers are annoying.

1:52:11.640 --> 1:52:12.760
 I have good internet.

1:52:12.760 --> 1:52:14.360
 I don't understand.

1:52:14.360 --> 1:52:15.360
 Bring me the grapes.

1:52:15.360 --> 1:52:18.640
 Well, that's, you know, you get your colligular effects.

1:52:18.640 --> 1:52:19.640
 That can happen.

1:52:19.640 --> 1:52:22.280
 Like Z from what I've seen has got elements of that.

1:52:22.280 --> 1:52:26.480
 So friends of mine who are Caucasians can get away with it.

1:52:26.480 --> 1:52:31.080
 They have a game that they play at conferences, scoring how often people use with Z's name

1:52:31.080 --> 1:52:35.000
 in a presentation and giving extra points for the number of photographs of Z that turn

1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:36.360
 up in the whole thing.

1:52:36.360 --> 1:52:40.200
 So you've got this sort of personality cult coming along as well.

1:52:40.200 --> 1:52:44.720
 But at the same time, the planning for the infrastructure that's being built, the social

1:52:44.720 --> 1:52:50.240
 services, the general freedom that exists is so great.

1:52:50.240 --> 1:52:56.200
 And like any Chinese person alive today, like somebody who's Chinese my age, would have

1:52:56.200 --> 1:53:02.440
 been an adult under the early period of, the late period of Mao.

1:53:02.440 --> 1:53:05.900
 And God almighty, the change, the improvement they've seen in their lives, that's what they

1:53:05.900 --> 1:53:06.900
 think about.

1:53:06.900 --> 1:53:07.900
 So.

1:53:07.900 --> 1:53:13.820
 But it's the, if you just look at the history of the 20th century, your intuition would

1:53:13.820 --> 1:53:18.360
 say that some of the mechanisms we see in China now will get you into trouble in the

1:53:18.360 --> 1:53:19.760
 long term.

1:53:19.760 --> 1:53:25.640
 So it seems to be working really well in many ways in terms of improving the quality of

1:53:25.640 --> 1:53:30.280
 life of the average citizen in China, but you start to get worried about how does this

1:53:30.280 --> 1:53:31.280
 go wrong?

1:53:31.280 --> 1:53:32.280
 Well, yeah.

1:53:32.280 --> 1:53:35.600
 But at the same time, maybe, I mean, often people will say, you know, what's your vision

1:53:35.600 --> 1:53:36.600
 for the future?

1:53:36.600 --> 1:53:40.680
 And what they mean is what vision for the future do you have that I'm going to like?

1:53:40.680 --> 1:53:41.680
 Right.

1:53:41.680 --> 1:53:42.680
 Okay.

1:53:42.680 --> 1:53:45.560
 What if you have a vision of the future that you don't like?

1:53:45.560 --> 1:53:46.560
 It's dreadful.

1:53:46.560 --> 1:53:52.080
 I mean, that's the ecological crisis I think we're walking blindfolded into.

1:53:52.080 --> 1:53:54.880
 Well, that's right.

1:53:54.880 --> 1:54:00.000
 That part of the picture we'll have to talk about how fundamental of a problem that is.

1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:01.000
 Okay.

1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:02.560
 But what does that have to do with the future of China?

1:54:02.560 --> 1:54:06.800
 What it has to do is that if you wish to impose dramatic controls on the consumption of the

1:54:06.800 --> 1:54:13.640
 rich, which would be necessary to reduce our consumption burden so that we can get closer

1:54:13.640 --> 1:54:19.080
 to the ecological envelope we've destroyed already, then you're going to make more likely

1:54:19.080 --> 1:54:24.280
 successful doing that with a centralized system where people accept centralized political

1:54:24.280 --> 1:54:25.280
 control.

1:54:25.280 --> 1:54:29.760
 Then you're in a country where it's all diversified and you scream freedom between every point

1:54:29.760 --> 1:54:30.760
 in a tennis match.

1:54:30.760 --> 1:54:35.340
 And I've literally seen that when I was in Philadelphia some time back.

1:54:35.340 --> 1:54:41.960
 So the ideology that accepts a collectivist attitude may be more successful in controlling

1:54:41.960 --> 1:54:44.520
 our reducing human consumption levels.

1:54:44.520 --> 1:54:49.280
 Because when we talk about democracy, I mean, who's voting here?

1:54:49.280 --> 1:54:56.120
 How many horses and elephants and birds get to vote?

1:54:56.120 --> 1:54:57.120
 It's very...

1:54:57.120 --> 1:54:58.120
 What's a bird?

1:54:58.120 --> 1:54:59.120
 Yeah.

1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:01.200
 You don't see them around here.

1:55:01.200 --> 1:55:04.840
 It's a very human centric vision we have of this planet.

1:55:04.840 --> 1:55:07.160
 And we're going to pay a price for that.

1:55:07.160 --> 1:55:08.160
 Okay.

1:55:08.160 --> 1:55:14.800
 So you're saying to deal with global catastrophic events, centralized planning might be...

1:55:14.800 --> 1:55:18.760
 I think will work better, period.

1:55:18.760 --> 1:55:22.440
 But there is some centralized stuff in the United States, for example.

1:55:22.440 --> 1:55:23.440
 Oh, your military.

1:55:23.440 --> 1:55:24.440
 Yeah, I know.

1:55:24.440 --> 1:55:25.440
 No, no.

1:55:25.440 --> 1:55:26.440
 Okay.

1:55:26.440 --> 1:55:27.440
 All right.

1:55:27.440 --> 1:55:31.040
 Now there's that feisty Australian.

1:55:31.040 --> 1:55:35.560
 So besides the military, that's the ideal of the federal government in the United States

1:55:35.560 --> 1:55:40.680
 is that there is some centralized infrastructure building.

1:55:40.680 --> 1:55:41.680
 There's some big...

1:55:41.680 --> 1:55:43.240
 There's not enough of it, yeah.

1:55:43.240 --> 1:55:44.240
 But there's some.

1:55:44.240 --> 1:55:45.240
 There's some.

1:55:45.240 --> 1:55:50.400
 The question is, when you deal with greater and greater global catastrophic events, like

1:55:50.400 --> 1:55:53.480
 the pandemic that we're just living through, that the government would be able to step

1:55:53.480 --> 1:56:01.400
 up and impose enough centralized planning to allow us to deal, sort of enable, empower

1:56:01.400 --> 1:56:04.620
 the citizenry to deal with these catastrophic events.

1:56:04.620 --> 1:56:09.200
 In the case of the pandemic, a lot of people argue that the, first of all, the world, but

1:56:09.200 --> 1:56:15.640
 also the United States failed to effectively deal with the pandemic.

1:56:15.640 --> 1:56:21.600
 On the medical side, on the social side, on the financial side, the supply chain, everything.

1:56:21.600 --> 1:56:29.360
 In terms of communication, in terms of inspiring the populace with the power of science and

1:56:29.360 --> 1:56:30.360
 all the fronts.

1:56:30.360 --> 1:56:31.360
 Yeah, yeah.

1:56:31.360 --> 1:56:32.360
 They failed.

1:56:32.360 --> 1:56:34.680
 But the ideal is that we'd be able to succeed.

1:56:34.680 --> 1:56:38.840
 You would have to have a small, efficient, the ideal, the American ideal is you have

1:56:38.840 --> 1:56:43.960
 a small, efficient government that's able to take on tasks precisely like the pandemic.

1:56:43.960 --> 1:56:46.480
 But the thing is, maybe it shouldn't have been as small as it was.

1:56:46.480 --> 1:56:51.240
 I mean, my favorite instance of that actually involves the UK because the whole neoliberal

1:56:51.240 --> 1:56:53.800
 approach is about small, efficient government.

1:56:53.800 --> 1:56:54.800
 Okay?

1:56:54.800 --> 1:56:58.600
 Well, small, efficient government works when you face small, efficient challenges.

1:56:58.600 --> 1:57:03.880
 When you face something systemic rather than episodic, then it's going to break down.

1:57:03.880 --> 1:57:08.980
 And like this is, I mean, one of the things I greatly respect is Taleb's idea of antifragile.

1:57:08.980 --> 1:57:13.240
 You want a society which is antifragile, not easily broken, whereas neoliberalism has pushed

1:57:13.240 --> 1:57:16.480
 us towards this vision of efficiency, but it's easily snapped.

1:57:16.480 --> 1:57:22.440
 Like in the UK, I've forgotten the government minister involved, but she was, she asked

1:57:22.440 --> 1:57:28.160
 her expert committee, how many, this is before, well before the pandemic, how many masks should

1:57:28.160 --> 1:57:31.120
 we have on hand in case of a pandemic?

1:57:31.120 --> 1:57:33.640
 And the answer from the experts was about a billion.

1:57:33.640 --> 1:57:34.640
 Okay.

1:57:34.640 --> 1:57:37.680
 That's 50 masks, that's 20 masks per person.

1:57:37.680 --> 1:57:38.680
 Okay.

1:57:38.680 --> 1:57:39.940
 Oh, that's too many.

1:57:39.940 --> 1:57:42.400
 Let's just make 50 million masks.

1:57:42.400 --> 1:57:43.660
 That's one mask per person.

1:57:43.660 --> 1:57:45.920
 It was gone in a matter of a day.

1:57:45.920 --> 1:57:46.920
 Okay.

1:57:46.920 --> 1:57:48.820
 And therefore that's why they told us, well, masks don't work.

1:57:48.820 --> 1:57:53.280
 You know, what they meant was we don't have enough masks for our health people, let alone

1:57:53.280 --> 1:57:54.280
 for you and the public.

1:57:54.280 --> 1:57:58.120
 So we're going to bullshit you and tell you those masks don't really work.

1:57:58.120 --> 1:58:01.840
 And then people don't wear masks and then we've got enough masks, we rush up the production

1:58:01.840 --> 1:58:02.840
 job.

1:58:02.840 --> 1:58:05.960
 And by the time it comes along, people have got the skepticism about masks.

1:58:05.960 --> 1:58:10.120
 So who does, can you elaborate, who does the blame in that case go on to?

1:58:10.120 --> 1:58:13.720
 The blame comes down to the philosophy that says government should always be small.

1:58:13.720 --> 1:58:18.280
 No, but do you, do you really think that bigger government would be the solution to the mask

1:58:18.280 --> 1:58:19.280
 issue?

1:58:19.280 --> 1:58:20.280
 No.

1:58:20.280 --> 1:58:21.280
 So let me, let me push back.

1:58:21.280 --> 1:58:24.600
 Sort of it's possible that that's capitalism solves that problem.

1:58:24.600 --> 1:58:30.320
 Well, not, not if there's no money in really longterm planning and capitalism.

1:58:30.320 --> 1:58:31.320
 Okay.

1:58:31.320 --> 1:58:37.580
 There's money, there's money in the, isn't it possible to construct, isn't possible for

1:58:37.580 --> 1:58:42.840
 capitalism to construct the system that ensures against catastrophic events?

1:58:42.840 --> 1:58:47.500
 Not when they're systemic, you can ensure against episodic events.

1:58:47.500 --> 1:58:52.440
 If you occasionally have a really bad storm, but in general the weather's not so bad that

1:58:52.440 --> 1:58:56.400
 all the infrastructure is being destroyed, then you can share that around on a percentage

1:58:56.400 --> 1:58:57.400
 basis.

1:58:57.400 --> 1:59:02.040
 If you have a Gaussian distribution for your events and you don't, the mean doesn't move

1:59:02.040 --> 1:59:06.520
 around too much and the standard deviation doesn't change all that much, then insurance

1:59:06.520 --> 1:59:07.520
 works fine.

1:59:07.520 --> 1:59:11.400
 But if you have an, if that's episodic, if you have systemic stuff where the climate

1:59:11.400 --> 1:59:17.840
 is changing completely and you're going to wipe out your agricultural capabilities, you

1:59:17.840 --> 1:59:20.180
 simply can't do insurance on that front.

1:59:20.180 --> 1:59:24.080
 You can't make a profit out of catastrophe and capitalism.

1:59:24.080 --> 1:59:25.080
 Okay.

1:59:25.080 --> 1:59:29.920
 So that example of climate change, let's talk about it.

1:59:29.920 --> 1:59:30.920
 Okay.

1:59:30.920 --> 1:59:37.360
 So you mentioned that the human brain, the economy, and the biosphere are three of the

1:59:37.360 --> 1:59:40.080
 most complex systems we know.

1:59:40.080 --> 1:59:41.880
 Okay.

1:59:41.880 --> 1:59:51.400
 And you also criticize the economics community for looking at the effects of climate change

1:59:51.400 --> 1:59:55.240
 when measured as the effect on the GDP.

1:59:55.240 --> 2:00:01.360
 So you're saying it's a catastrophic thing that the biggest challenge our society, our

2:00:01.360 --> 2:00:02.840
 world is facing.

2:00:02.840 --> 2:00:03.840
 Why?

2:00:03.840 --> 2:00:10.000
 If the economists disagree with you, the effects on the GDP will be minor.

2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:14.080
 So we'll deal with it when it comes.

2:00:14.080 --> 2:00:16.120
 That's the argument against, that's the devil's advocate.

2:00:16.120 --> 2:00:23.160
 You're saying, no, it is a thing that will change our world forever in ways that we should

2:00:23.160 --> 2:00:25.520
 really, really, really be thinking about.

2:00:25.520 --> 2:00:26.520
 Okay.

2:00:26.520 --> 2:00:27.520
 Okay.

2:00:27.520 --> 2:00:28.520
 Make the case of why you disagree with the economists.

2:00:28.520 --> 2:00:30.040
 The case is simple.

2:00:30.040 --> 2:00:34.120
 Economists have made up their own numbers to say that it's trivial.

2:00:34.120 --> 2:00:35.120
 And you didn't.

2:00:35.120 --> 2:00:37.600
 No, I haven't even tried to make the numbers.

2:00:37.600 --> 2:00:39.320
 I'm reading what the scientists write.

2:00:39.320 --> 2:00:40.320
 Okay.

2:00:40.320 --> 2:00:41.320
 Okay.

2:00:41.320 --> 2:00:45.160
 And what the economists have done, and like this is William Nordhaus in particular, Nobel

2:00:45.160 --> 2:00:50.200
 Prize winner, ex president of the American Economic Association, literally assumed that

2:00:50.200 --> 2:00:52.280
 a roof will protect you from climate change.

2:00:52.280 --> 2:00:54.880
 And he didn't say it in those words.

2:00:54.880 --> 2:00:59.960
 What he said was 87% of American industry occurs in carefully controlled environments,

2:00:59.960 --> 2:01:02.360
 which will not be subject to climate change.

2:01:02.360 --> 2:01:08.200
 Now the only things that all of manufacturing, all of services, he included mining as well,

2:01:08.200 --> 2:01:13.760
 meaning about open cut mining, government activities, and the finance sector, all they

2:01:13.760 --> 2:01:16.120
 have in common is they happen beneath a roof.

2:01:16.120 --> 2:01:20.800
 So he's basically saying climate affects the weather, climate is weather.

2:01:20.800 --> 2:01:21.800
 Okay.

2:01:21.800 --> 2:01:22.800
 Okay.

2:01:22.800 --> 2:01:25.920
 Now that is not at all what is meant by climate change.

2:01:25.920 --> 2:01:32.140
 It's changing the entire pattern of the weather system of the planet.

2:01:32.140 --> 2:01:37.600
 For example, the most extreme form of climate change would be a breakdown in the three circulation

2:01:37.600 --> 2:01:39.840
 cells that exist in each hemisphere.

2:01:39.840 --> 2:01:44.480
 The Hadley cell, the Ferrer cell, I think it's called, and the polar cell, 0 to 30,

2:01:44.480 --> 2:01:50.520
 30 to 60, 60 to 90, those are the main bubbles, if you like, in the atmosphere.

2:01:50.520 --> 2:01:56.760
 Now if we get enough increase in the energy in the atmosphere, just like you turn the

2:01:56.760 --> 2:02:01.220
 temperature up on a stove and you have nice bubbles occurring in a pot of soup and then

2:02:01.220 --> 2:02:05.240
 turn the temperature up and they all break down and you've got bubbles everywhere, that's

2:02:05.240 --> 2:02:06.600
 called the equitable climate.

2:02:06.600 --> 2:02:12.320
 If that happens, then most of the rainfall is going to occur between 0 and 20 and 70

2:02:12.320 --> 2:02:18.420
 and 90, and the middle is going to be dry, except for extreme storms.

2:02:18.420 --> 2:02:24.620
 We built our societies in a period of extreme stability of the climate, and when you look

2:02:24.620 --> 2:02:31.520
 at the long term temperature records, it's up and down like a seesaw, like a sawtooth

2:02:31.520 --> 2:02:36.720
 blade between, say, one degree warmer than now and four degrees or six degrees cooler

2:02:36.720 --> 2:02:39.000
 over the last million years.

2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:43.700
 When you look at where we evolved, it's just at a turning point on the peak of one of those

2:02:43.700 --> 2:02:44.700
 ups and downs.

2:02:44.700 --> 2:02:48.760
 I've forgotten the name of the cycles, but the cycles are caused by changes in the Earth's

2:02:48.760 --> 2:02:57.240
 rotation around the sun, and so we evolved our civilization just at the top, so coming

2:02:57.240 --> 2:03:02.860
 up from a cold period, and then we're going to head down to another cold period, and that's

2:03:02.860 --> 2:03:04.560
 when human civilization came along.

2:03:04.560 --> 2:03:07.020
 It's about a period of about 12,000 years.

2:03:07.020 --> 2:03:11.960
 So across that period, the temperature has changed by not much more than half a degree

2:03:11.960 --> 2:03:12.960
 up and down.

2:03:12.960 --> 2:03:20.600
 Now, we're blasting it well and truly out of those confines, and my way of interpreting

2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:25.180
 what climate change means is the stability of that climate that enables to build sedentary

2:03:25.180 --> 2:03:30.220
 civilizations and not be a nomadic species is being destroyed.

2:03:30.220 --> 2:03:38.060
 So the challenge, and by the way, I'm playing devil's advocate right here.

2:03:38.060 --> 2:03:42.280
 The question is, is there something fundamentally different now about human civilization that

2:03:42.280 --> 2:03:51.480
 we're able to build technology that alleviates some of the destructive effects that we have

2:03:51.480 --> 2:03:52.480
 on the climate?

2:03:52.480 --> 2:03:53.480
 We don't know.

2:03:53.480 --> 2:03:56.340
 We're going to find out the hard way.

2:03:56.340 --> 2:03:58.920
 And the uncertainty, you think, would be very costly.

2:03:58.920 --> 2:03:59.920
 Extremely.

2:03:59.920 --> 2:04:05.800
 Like, many of the trajectories we might take would be much more costly than they're profitable.

2:04:05.800 --> 2:04:06.800
 Yeah.

2:04:06.800 --> 2:04:10.440
 And like, when we're seeing some of the storms that are happening now in Europe, the ones

2:04:10.440 --> 2:04:15.840
 that washed away a village in Germany some time ago, the firestorm that hit Canada of

2:04:15.840 --> 2:04:19.980
 all places, I've forgotten the name of the town that was burnt down, but enormous temperatures

2:04:19.980 --> 2:04:24.920
 in Canada, again, the storms that have been happening back in Australia.

2:04:24.920 --> 2:04:29.400
 These are all manifestations of a complete shift in the weather patterns of the planet.

2:04:29.400 --> 2:04:35.000
 And they can wipe out, like a village just disappears, just wiped out by unprecedented

2:04:35.000 --> 2:04:39.280
 rains, and this keeps on happening.

2:04:39.280 --> 2:04:44.200
 We are still living in a sedentary lifestyle when we're a nomadic species.

2:04:44.200 --> 2:04:49.420
 So to be able to maintain that sedentary lifestyle, we do need to engineer the planet.

2:04:49.420 --> 2:04:56.760
 We need to keep it within that range of plus half a degree Celsius, minus half a degree,

2:04:56.760 --> 2:05:01.260
 which is really what it's been like for the last 10,000, 12,000 years, instead we're blasting

2:05:01.260 --> 2:05:03.360
 it right out of that range.

2:05:03.360 --> 2:05:07.360
 And we know some of the past climates that have existed then.

2:05:07.360 --> 2:05:12.560
 We can model what they imply for our food production systems, for example.

2:05:12.560 --> 2:05:15.320
 Not the only example, but obviously crucial.

2:05:15.320 --> 2:05:20.880
 So when you look at what are called global climate models produced by scientists, one

2:05:20.880 --> 2:05:27.480
 of the examples, and it was published by the OECD last year, 2021, in the chapter on what

2:05:27.480 --> 2:05:32.360
 would happen if we lose what's called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation,

2:05:32.360 --> 2:05:35.920
 or AMOC, and people would colloquially know that as the Gulf Stream.

2:05:35.920 --> 2:05:39.680
 And that's what distributes heat around all the oceans of the planet.

2:05:39.680 --> 2:05:43.720
 It's part of a huge chain called the thermohaline circulation.

2:05:43.720 --> 2:05:49.680
 But the part that goes across from the equator to the North Atlantic, that's called the AMOC

2:05:49.680 --> 2:05:56.520
 and Gulf Stream colloquially, if that disappears in the context of a two and a half degree

2:05:56.520 --> 2:06:02.960
 Celsius increase in average global temperature, then the proportion of the Earth's surface,

2:06:02.960 --> 2:06:09.320
 which is suitable for producing wheat, will fall from 20% to 7%.

2:06:09.320 --> 2:06:11.980
 Proportion for corn, similar sort of fall.

2:06:11.980 --> 2:06:15.760
 The proportion suitable for rice will go from 2% to 3%.

2:06:15.760 --> 2:06:19.200
 Now that means a catastrophic, and that's the word used in the report, catastrophic

2:06:19.200 --> 2:06:22.080
 collapse in food production.

2:06:22.080 --> 2:06:24.900
 So that's what we're toying with.

2:06:24.900 --> 2:06:29.200
 And we are one and a half, we're actually less than, we're about halfway there to that

2:06:29.200 --> 2:06:32.520
 two degrees, 2.5.

2:06:32.520 --> 2:06:40.200
 And economists, on the other hand, and this is Richard Toll, published a paper 2016, claiming

2:06:40.200 --> 2:06:45.920
 using what he calls an integrated assessment model that economists developed, that losing

2:06:45.920 --> 2:06:51.080
 the Gulf Stream would increase global GDP by 1.1%.

2:06:51.080 --> 2:06:55.040
 Now his model, this is what really pisses me off about these people, it's the worst

2:06:55.040 --> 2:07:00.360
 work I've read in 50 years of being a critic of neoclassical economics.

2:07:00.360 --> 2:07:06.560
 The GCMs, the one scientists produce, of course include precipitation as well as temperature.

2:07:06.560 --> 2:07:12.420
 The IAMs that the economists produce, and this is stated yet again in a paper in 2021,

2:07:12.420 --> 2:07:17.120
 do not include precipitation, they simply have temperature.

2:07:17.120 --> 2:07:22.180
 So they assume that if temperature improves by moving towards a temperature which is better

2:07:22.180 --> 2:07:26.120
 for producing aquaculture, okay, then so will precipitation.

2:07:26.120 --> 2:07:30.780
 Now that's completely wrong, they've left out a crucial, imagine trying to model the

2:07:30.780 --> 2:07:33.920
 climate while ignoring the fact that there's rainfall.

2:07:33.920 --> 2:07:35.000
 That's what they've done.

2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:39.200
 So their work is so bad, so dreadfully bad, it should never have been published.

2:07:39.200 --> 2:07:40.680
 So they over, all right, all right, okay.

2:07:40.680 --> 2:07:42.680
 I'm not gonna go for them, sorry, this is...

2:07:42.680 --> 2:07:48.520
 Well, no, no, 100% as they deserve it, so it's an oversimplification, but I also want

2:07:48.520 --> 2:07:55.160
 you to steel man people you disagree with and criticize people you agree with, if possible,

2:07:55.160 --> 2:07:57.400
 to be sort of intellectually honest here.

2:07:57.400 --> 2:08:07.960
 You do say, sort of to push back on the catastrophic thinking about climate change, that the ecology,

2:08:07.960 --> 2:08:18.300
 the biosphere is a complex system, economics, the economy is a complex system.

2:08:18.300 --> 2:08:22.080
 So how can we make predictions about complex systems?

2:08:22.080 --> 2:08:28.920
 How can we make a hope of having a semi confident predictions about the complex system?

2:08:28.920 --> 2:08:36.280
 So the scientific community is very confident about the complex system that is the biosphere

2:08:36.280 --> 2:08:43.040
 and the crisis that's before us on the horizon.

2:08:43.040 --> 2:08:47.840
 And then the economists are, as a community, I don't know, I don't know what percentage,

2:08:47.840 --> 2:08:48.840
 but...

2:08:48.840 --> 2:08:49.840
 Too much.

2:08:49.840 --> 2:08:58.560
 Too much, that part of the community is very confident looking at the economics complex

2:08:58.560 --> 2:09:07.840
 system in saying that, no, this system we have of labor and money and capital and so

2:09:07.840 --> 2:09:12.040
 on, we'll be able to deal with that crisis and any other crisis.

2:09:12.040 --> 2:09:19.340
 And they kind of construct simplified models that justify their confidence.

2:09:19.340 --> 2:09:21.480
 So how do we know who to believe?

2:09:21.480 --> 2:09:26.520
 For a start, if you believe the economists, you need your head read.

2:09:26.520 --> 2:09:27.520
 Because when you...

2:09:27.520 --> 2:09:28.520
 It's not an argument.

2:09:28.520 --> 2:09:29.520
 No, it's not an argument.

2:09:29.520 --> 2:09:30.520
 It's a summary of an argument.

2:09:30.520 --> 2:09:31.520
 And that is the...

2:09:31.520 --> 2:09:32.880
 No, that sounds a lot like an opinion and an emotional...

2:09:32.880 --> 2:09:33.880
 I know.

2:09:33.880 --> 2:09:34.880
 I know.

2:09:34.880 --> 2:09:35.880
 I'm so angry about it.

2:09:35.880 --> 2:09:39.040
 Listen, I'll tell you where I stand.

2:09:39.040 --> 2:09:44.160
 And I've begun looking, studying the climate change much more.

2:09:44.160 --> 2:09:52.080
 I used to be on things I don't understand, have not spent time on.

2:09:52.080 --> 2:10:01.880
 I have so many colleagues that are scientists that I deeply respect, and I trust their opinion.

2:10:01.880 --> 2:10:12.160
 I have seen the lesser angels of my colleagues on the pandemic side, on the COVID side.

2:10:12.160 --> 2:10:20.060
 The confidence, the arrogance that in part blinded, I believe, the jump between basic

2:10:20.060 --> 2:10:25.220
 scientific research to public policy.

2:10:25.220 --> 2:10:32.240
 And then, so I've become a little bit more cautious in my trust on climate change.

2:10:32.240 --> 2:10:37.880
 I'm still in the same place, and I don't mean climate change, on anything scientists say.

2:10:37.880 --> 2:10:44.220
 I become a little bit, wait a minute.

2:10:44.220 --> 2:10:49.960
 How does the basic scientific facts of our reality map to what we should do as a human

2:10:49.960 --> 2:10:50.960
 civilization?

2:10:50.960 --> 2:10:51.960
 Yeah.

2:10:51.960 --> 2:10:52.960
 There, I want to be a little bit careful.

2:10:52.960 --> 2:10:57.240
 So whenever now I see arrogance and confidence, I become suspicious.

2:10:57.240 --> 2:11:02.640
 Well, I'm the same, and that's why I'm being angry about The Economist, because there's

2:11:02.640 --> 2:11:09.240
 incredible arrogance, incredible stupidity at the arrogance, assumptions which you look

2:11:09.240 --> 2:11:12.120
 at it and think, how did anybody let that get published?

2:11:12.120 --> 2:11:13.120
 Sure.

2:11:13.120 --> 2:11:14.120
 Okay.

2:11:14.120 --> 2:11:19.480
 So the economic analysis of the effects of climate change are poor, in many cases.

2:11:19.480 --> 2:11:20.720
 Incredibly poor.

2:11:20.720 --> 2:11:26.300
 And this is like, Bjorn Lomborg styles himself as the skeptical environmentalist and criticizes

2:11:26.300 --> 2:11:28.660
 the environmental models.

2:11:28.660 --> 2:11:30.120
 He doesn't take a look.

2:11:30.120 --> 2:11:33.040
 He doesn't criticize the work come out by economists.

2:11:33.040 --> 2:11:34.040
 You look at it.

2:11:34.040 --> 2:11:35.280
 It's so bad.

2:11:35.280 --> 2:11:39.960
 Is it possible to do good economics modeling of the effects of climate change?

2:11:39.960 --> 2:11:42.200
 Yeah, it is possible.

2:11:42.200 --> 2:11:43.200
 Very difficult.

2:11:43.200 --> 2:11:45.800
 Or is it like one complex systems tech?

2:11:45.800 --> 2:11:46.800
 It's two modes.

2:11:46.800 --> 2:11:47.800
 In that case, yeah.

2:11:47.800 --> 2:11:52.520
 I mean, like to me, what you should be looking at is saying, what are the scientists saying

2:11:52.520 --> 2:11:58.160
 are the consequences, probable consequences, not guaranteed, but probable consequences

2:11:58.160 --> 2:12:03.520
 of increasing the energy level of the atmosphere by the amount we're doing.

2:12:03.520 --> 2:12:07.960
 What can the scientists say in terms of like, the effects, because it's so complicated,

2:12:07.960 --> 2:12:15.280
 the effects of sort of shifting resources, so basically, what are the effects of climate

2:12:15.280 --> 2:12:16.280
 change?

2:12:16.280 --> 2:12:17.280
 How can we really model that?

2:12:17.280 --> 2:12:22.240
 Because it's basically you're looking through the fog of uncertainty because they're rising

2:12:22.240 --> 2:12:24.280
 sea levels.

2:12:24.280 --> 2:12:26.080
 How can we know what effect that has?

2:12:26.080 --> 2:12:28.520
 Well, we know there'll be a lot of change.

2:12:28.520 --> 2:12:29.520
 Yeah.

2:12:29.520 --> 2:12:33.200
 Well, I don't actually, I think the sea level one is a poor argument, and I don't focus

2:12:33.200 --> 2:12:34.200
 on it.

2:12:34.200 --> 2:12:38.680
 What I mainly focus upon is the weather patterns, okay?

2:12:38.680 --> 2:12:43.000
 And if you look at, like we've got the, the wheat belt in America goes through what Idaho

2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:48.600
 and countries, places like that, and you've got an incredibly deep topsoil, like Ukraine

2:12:48.600 --> 2:12:49.840
 is another classic example.

2:12:49.840 --> 2:12:55.680
 The depth of the topsoil in Ukraine is remarkable, and that's the wheat bowl of Europe.

2:12:55.680 --> 2:13:00.040
 And that requires both the right temperature for growing wheat and the right rainfall for

2:13:00.040 --> 2:13:01.040
 growing wheat.

2:13:01.040 --> 2:13:07.400
 Now, when you look at the models that climate scientists are building of that, you have

2:13:07.400 --> 2:13:13.760
 pretty much, your ultimate foundation is the Lorenz model of turbulent flow.

2:13:13.760 --> 2:13:19.240
 And of course, that's the first model which we saw chaos theory, complexity, that beautiful

2:13:19.240 --> 2:13:25.400
 simple model, three variables, three parameters, an incredible complexity out of the system.

2:13:25.400 --> 2:13:31.440
 But and what that meant was you also had an exponential decay in the accuracy of your

2:13:31.440 --> 2:13:32.560
 model over time.

2:13:32.560 --> 2:13:39.640
 So if you have, if you're accurate to a thousand decimal places, then in a thousand days, you'll

2:13:39.640 --> 2:13:44.600
 have no data whatsoever, because each time you're losing an order of magnitude of accuracy.

2:13:44.600 --> 2:13:48.840
 So that's the point about the inability to predict for the very long future.

2:13:48.840 --> 2:13:51.760
 But what you can do is say, well, there's a prediction horizon.

2:13:51.760 --> 2:13:57.080
 If we're close enough to the, if our statistical measurement of where we are is close enough

2:13:57.080 --> 2:14:02.800
 to where we actually are, and our forecast horizon is narrow enough to not extrapolate

2:14:02.800 --> 2:14:06.880
 too far, then for this direction forward, we can make a reasonable fist of predicting

2:14:06.880 --> 2:14:08.720
 what the weather's going to be.

2:14:08.720 --> 2:14:12.840
 And that's the foundation of meteorological, the stuff we watch on TV.

2:14:12.840 --> 2:14:16.840
 You know, most of the time, the forecasts are going to be correct these days.

2:14:16.840 --> 2:14:20.840
 40, 50 years ago, most of the time, the forecasts were wrong.

2:14:20.840 --> 2:14:24.600
 So that's the background foundation to these GCMs.

2:14:24.600 --> 2:14:26.760
 But even they've got to massively simplify the world.

2:14:26.760 --> 2:14:31.000
 So you have this enormous sphere of where they might divide it down to 100 kilometer

2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:40.380
 by 100 kilometer by 10 kilometer cube, rectangles, whatever, oblongs.

2:14:40.380 --> 2:14:45.800
 That's how they're modeling the transition of where they're from one location to another.

2:14:45.800 --> 2:14:49.640
 So they've got a chunky vision of the planet, which they have to.

2:14:49.640 --> 2:14:52.280
 They can't model it now down to the last molecule.

2:14:52.280 --> 2:14:53.280
 So you're losing it.

2:14:53.280 --> 2:14:54.280
 Not yet, right?

2:14:54.280 --> 2:14:55.280
 It's getting better, better, better, better.

2:14:55.280 --> 2:14:56.280
 Oh, yeah.

2:14:56.280 --> 2:14:58.440
 I think that's just too much processing power.

2:14:58.440 --> 2:15:00.280
 But you're going to have some confines.

2:15:00.280 --> 2:15:04.400
 You can't go, I mean, if you look at the models to do the weather, they used to be of that

2:15:04.400 --> 2:15:08.120
 100 kilometer, I think they're about 10 kilometer grids now, I don't know.

2:15:08.120 --> 2:15:11.400
 So the processing powers let us get more and more precise that way.

2:15:11.400 --> 2:15:16.960
 I do know that the models now include chemical mixing that occurs above cities.

2:15:16.960 --> 2:15:19.120
 They've added that complexity to them over time.

2:15:19.120 --> 2:15:23.080
 So you're looking at the increasingly accurate models of weather patterns, the effect they

2:15:23.080 --> 2:15:25.760
 have on agriculture, on food.

2:15:25.760 --> 2:15:31.920
 And you're saying that there's a lot of possibilities in which that's going to be really destructive

2:15:31.920 --> 2:15:34.280
 to society on the food production side.

2:15:34.280 --> 2:15:38.180
 And if you have that increase in temperature, you're going to get a change in precipitation.

2:15:38.180 --> 2:15:42.540
 And it could mean that where the rainfall and the sunshine are adequate for growing

2:15:42.540 --> 2:15:45.640
 wheat is an area where there's no topsoil.

2:15:45.640 --> 2:15:50.680
 Like a huge part of the models, the models the economists use, which only use temperature,

2:15:50.680 --> 2:15:51.680
 don't include precipitation.

2:15:51.680 --> 2:15:58.340
 They predict that a large amount of the wheat output of the world is going to occur in Siberia

2:15:58.340 --> 2:16:00.240
 in the frozen tundra.

2:16:00.240 --> 2:16:05.300
 What about, so that's a straightforward criticism of oversimplified models.

2:16:05.300 --> 2:16:09.680
 What about the idea that we innovate our way out of it?

2:16:09.680 --> 2:16:17.600
 So there's totally new, what is the, there's a silly, poor example at this time perhaps,

2:16:17.600 --> 2:16:22.280
 but lab grown meat, sort of engineered food.

2:16:22.280 --> 2:16:30.680
 So a completely shifting source of food for civilization.

2:16:30.680 --> 2:16:33.800
 So therefore alleviating some of the pressure on agriculture.

2:16:33.800 --> 2:16:38.900
 That comes down to the difference that Elon makes between producing a prototype and mass

2:16:38.900 --> 2:16:41.600
 producing the prototype.

2:16:41.600 --> 2:16:47.800
 You can develop the idea very rapidly to put that into production on the scale that's necessary

2:16:47.800 --> 2:16:49.440
 to replace what we're currently doing.

2:16:49.440 --> 2:16:50.440
 Six years.

2:16:50.440 --> 2:16:51.440
 Yeah.

2:16:51.440 --> 2:16:52.440
 And we haven't got years.

2:16:52.440 --> 2:16:53.440
 We've got, we might have decades.

2:16:53.440 --> 2:16:56.060
 We certainly haven't got centuries.

2:16:56.060 --> 2:17:02.040
 So in the timeframe we've got, I can't see that engineering going from prototype to production

2:17:02.040 --> 2:17:07.580
 levels to replace what we're currently doing in the stable environment they're currently

2:17:07.580 --> 2:17:08.580
 destroying.

2:17:08.580 --> 2:17:13.400
 What do you think about the sort of the catastrophic predictions that people that have thought

2:17:13.400 --> 2:17:16.760
 have written about climate have made in the past that haven't come to people?

2:17:16.760 --> 2:17:21.920
 That's mainly unfortunately involving Paul Ehrlich and the population bomb and the predictions

2:17:21.920 --> 2:17:22.920
 Paul was making.

2:17:22.920 --> 2:17:25.840
 A few individuals or the one individual in that case.

2:17:25.840 --> 2:17:31.560
 So I'm mostly playing devil's advocate in this conversation and enjoying doing so.

2:17:31.560 --> 2:17:38.360
 I do think I'm in agreement with the majority of the scientific community.

2:17:38.360 --> 2:17:40.680
 But you still see that argument made.

2:17:40.680 --> 2:17:42.760
 I still see the argument made.

2:17:42.760 --> 2:17:47.560
 And I also am a little bit worried about the arrogance and the ineffectiveness of the arrogance.

2:17:47.560 --> 2:17:48.560
 This is the problem.

2:17:48.560 --> 2:17:50.020
 It's ineffective.

2:17:50.020 --> 2:17:58.720
 And that's what worries me because it's all been put into the sort of sea level rise,

2:17:58.720 --> 2:18:01.440
 temperature changes.

2:18:01.440 --> 2:18:08.600
 It's not put into the fragility of the system in which we currently live.

2:18:08.600 --> 2:18:09.600
 And the Earth will survive.

2:18:09.600 --> 2:18:14.600
 And there's a wonderful science fiction book called The Earth Abides about a world in which

2:18:14.600 --> 2:18:15.600
 humans get wiped out.

2:18:15.600 --> 2:18:19.200
 There's only a tiny little band left and then the Earth reasserts itself.

2:18:19.200 --> 2:18:20.880
 So the Earth's going to survive us.

2:18:20.880 --> 2:18:22.500
 Will we survive what we do to the Earth?

2:18:22.500 --> 2:18:24.160
 That's the question.

2:18:24.160 --> 2:18:32.600
 And my feeling is that we have underplayed the extent to which the civilizations were

2:18:32.600 --> 2:18:36.360
 built have depended upon a relatively stable climate.

2:18:36.360 --> 2:18:41.240
 And it's then there's that turning point in the global average temperature that we evolved

2:18:41.240 --> 2:18:42.500
 right on the top of it.

2:18:42.500 --> 2:18:46.840
 And if we had done nothing, we could find that heading back down towards another ice

2:18:46.840 --> 2:18:51.000
 age could equally destroy the possibility of sedentary life.

2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:58.000
 So for example, if we'd never developed fossil fuel based industries, we'd never built superphosphate,

2:18:58.000 --> 2:19:02.760
 so our population would never have reached one billion people, and we were still living

2:19:02.760 --> 2:19:09.160
 like fairly sophisticated animals, but like 17th century level of load on the planet,

2:19:09.160 --> 2:19:12.080
 then we would have gone down that decline.

2:19:12.080 --> 2:19:17.440
 And the approaching ice age would have started to wipe out our farming areas, the glaciers

2:19:17.440 --> 2:19:21.940
 would have encroached, and we would have been driven out of like an agricultural sedentary

2:19:21.940 --> 2:19:24.000
 civilization by that change.

2:19:24.000 --> 2:19:30.200
 So it's just the fact that we evolved on this stable period in the overall temperature cycle

2:19:30.200 --> 2:19:31.260
 of the planet.

2:19:31.260 --> 2:19:36.360
 And that stability is something which just reflects the turning point in the regular

2:19:36.360 --> 2:19:38.800
 cycle of Malicevich cycle, I think it's called.

2:19:38.800 --> 2:19:43.980
 I've forgotten the actual name, but it's a cycle caused by change in the Earth's orbit

2:19:43.980 --> 2:19:48.040
 around the sun, reflectivity and so on.

2:19:48.040 --> 2:19:53.320
 That cycle, it's just that tiny top bit that we evolved in.

2:19:53.320 --> 2:19:56.840
 So what we should have done is, well, that's really useful for us, we should stay at that

2:19:56.840 --> 2:19:57.840
 level.

2:19:57.840 --> 2:20:01.420
 Now, if we hadn't done it, we'd go back down here and that'd be the end of our civilization

2:20:01.420 --> 2:20:02.420
 by an ice age.

2:20:02.420 --> 2:20:08.620
 Instead, we're going up here really rapidly, and we're causing a change in temperature

2:20:08.620 --> 2:20:14.720
 compared to that long term cycle 100,000 times faster.

2:20:14.720 --> 2:20:24.360
 So yeah, I mean, my biggest worry is even subtle changes in climate might result in

2:20:24.360 --> 2:20:28.920
 geopolitical pressures that then lead to nuclear war.

2:20:28.920 --> 2:20:33.600
 And that's, yeah, I mean, there's an argument that's actually behind, to some extent, not

2:20:33.600 --> 2:20:39.340
 the Ukraine war so much, but the Arab Spring, the wars in Syria, which partially has led

2:20:39.340 --> 2:20:42.000
 to what's happening in Ukraine.

2:20:42.000 --> 2:20:45.560
 And our weapons are getting more and more powerful and more and more destructive.

2:20:45.560 --> 2:20:49.080
 More and more nations are having these destructive weapons.

2:20:49.080 --> 2:20:54.520
 And now we're entering cyberspace, where it's even easier to be destructive.

2:20:54.520 --> 2:20:58.080
 And hyperbaric weapons, which didn't exist in the Second World War.

2:20:58.080 --> 2:21:03.040
 So you don't need nuclear weapons to have catastrophic attacks on each other.

2:21:03.040 --> 2:21:12.680
 So yeah, it's incredibly scary that the warlike side of human nature could be extremely enhanced

2:21:12.680 --> 2:21:14.600
 by climate breakdown.

2:21:14.600 --> 2:21:21.820
 So in this world, on a happy note, I don't know how we went from Marxism and Stalinism

2:21:21.820 --> 2:21:28.040
 to ecology, but all those are beautiful, complex systems.

2:21:28.040 --> 2:21:31.620
 What is the best form of government, would you say?

2:21:31.620 --> 2:21:36.520
 We talked about the economics of things.

2:21:36.520 --> 2:21:40.440
 You ran for office, so you care about politics too.

2:21:40.440 --> 2:21:43.640
 How can politics, what political systems can help us here?

2:21:43.640 --> 2:21:50.200
 I think we first of all have to appreciate we're one species on a planet out of millions.

2:21:50.200 --> 2:21:57.040
 And as the intelligent species, we should be enabling a harmonious life for those other

2:21:57.040 --> 2:21:58.040
 species as well.

2:21:58.040 --> 2:21:59.860
 Can we actually linger on that?

2:21:59.860 --> 2:22:08.400
 What is, you mentioned that we need to acknowledge the value of life on Earth.

2:22:08.400 --> 2:22:18.360
 Can we integrate the labor theory of value, can we integrate into that the value of life?

2:22:18.360 --> 2:22:21.840
 So there's human life, and there's life.

2:22:21.840 --> 2:22:28.240
 If you take that structure that I talked about of Marx's use value, exchange value, dialectic,

2:22:28.240 --> 2:22:32.480
 and foreground background, that only exists, that only works because we're exploiting the

2:22:32.480 --> 2:22:35.040
 free energy we find in the universe.

2:22:35.040 --> 2:22:41.840
 There could be no production system without free energy, which is the first law of thermodynamics

2:22:41.840 --> 2:22:42.840
 that exists.

2:22:42.840 --> 2:22:47.000
 There is free lunch, after all, and it's grounded in the energy that's provided to us by the

2:22:47.000 --> 2:22:48.000
 universe.

2:22:48.000 --> 2:22:49.000
 Well, yeah, that's the free lunch.

2:22:49.000 --> 2:22:50.000
 That's what we're exploiting.

2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:51.000
 It's the only free lunch we get.

2:22:51.000 --> 2:22:54.320
 You know Ginsburg's summary of the laws of thermodynamics, don't you?

2:22:54.320 --> 2:22:55.320
 Allen Ginsberg?

2:22:55.320 --> 2:22:56.320
 What's that?

2:22:56.320 --> 2:23:04.600
 The laws of thermodynamics are summarized as A, you can't win, B, you can't break even,

2:23:04.600 --> 2:23:08.600
 C, you can't leave the game.

2:23:08.600 --> 2:23:09.600
 Beautiful summary.

2:23:09.600 --> 2:23:10.600
 Beautiful summary.

2:23:10.600 --> 2:23:14.120
 But the fact that it exists in the first place is the free lunch.

2:23:14.120 --> 2:23:15.920
 So we're exploiting the free lunch.

2:23:15.920 --> 2:23:20.320
 But to be able to do it, we can't put waste back into that system so much that it undermines

2:23:20.320 --> 2:23:21.320
 the free lunch.

2:23:21.320 --> 2:23:23.840
 And that's what we've been doing.

2:23:23.840 --> 2:23:30.120
 And once you respect the fact that we have to, living on the biosphere, the planet we're

2:23:30.120 --> 2:23:35.960
 actually on, we have to enable that biosphere to survive us.

2:23:35.960 --> 2:23:40.200
 Because if it doesn't survive us, we won't survive it disappearing.

2:23:40.200 --> 2:23:43.520
 And there's not that realization in humanity in general.

2:23:43.520 --> 2:23:49.320
 And when you say the value of life, you know, all the different living organisms on Earth

2:23:49.320 --> 2:23:51.640
 are part of that biosphere.

2:23:51.640 --> 2:23:58.720
 So in order to maintain the biosphere, we have to respect, like pragmatically speaking,

2:23:58.720 --> 2:24:01.720
 what that means is actually respecting all of life on Earth.

2:24:01.720 --> 2:24:02.720
 Even the mosquitoes?

2:24:02.720 --> 2:24:03.720
 I've got some, no.

2:24:03.720 --> 2:24:04.720
 Parasites.

2:24:04.720 --> 2:24:10.540
 I mean, we are a parasite.

2:24:10.540 --> 2:24:17.160
 When you look at it, we're the mosquitoes of the large organizations.

2:24:17.160 --> 2:24:18.800
 You're a fan of the Matrix movies at all?

2:24:18.800 --> 2:24:19.800
 Sure.

2:24:19.800 --> 2:24:20.800
 Okay.

2:24:20.800 --> 2:24:21.800
 That's what I'm wearing.

2:24:21.800 --> 2:24:22.800
 Absolutely.

2:24:22.800 --> 2:24:23.800
 I was wondering what the inspiration was.

2:24:23.800 --> 2:24:24.800
 I was thinking...

2:24:24.800 --> 2:24:25.800
 It's not really inspiration.

2:24:25.800 --> 2:24:30.760
 We are living in a simulation, and I have a conversation offline to have with you about

2:24:30.760 --> 2:24:31.760
 that.

2:24:31.760 --> 2:24:34.320
 You've been misbehaving, and we're going to have to put you back in line.

2:24:34.320 --> 2:24:39.960
 So what's Agent Smith says when he's got Morpheus in his possession, he said, I've been trying

2:24:39.960 --> 2:24:45.000
 to classify your species, and I've decided you're a virus.

2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:46.240
 Now there's truth to that.

2:24:46.240 --> 2:24:48.880
 We have intruded into everything.

2:24:48.880 --> 2:24:55.000
 We've taken over every element of the biosphere, and we think we can continue doing that.

2:24:55.000 --> 2:24:57.320
 And the thing is, we're breaking that.

2:24:57.320 --> 2:24:59.880
 We're exporting it so much, we're breaking it down.

2:24:59.880 --> 2:25:03.400
 And I think it's E.O. Wilson who argued the 50 percent rule.

2:25:03.400 --> 2:25:09.560
 He believed that we should reserve 50 percent of the planet for nonhuman species.

2:25:09.560 --> 2:25:13.380
 In other words, we make 50 percent of it off limits.

2:25:13.380 --> 2:25:15.220
 Humans cannot go there.

2:25:15.220 --> 2:25:17.560
 And we just let that evolve as it does.

2:25:17.560 --> 2:25:19.760
 And then we control the other 50 percent.

2:25:19.760 --> 2:25:22.480
 I think it's probably giving too much to us.

2:25:22.480 --> 2:25:27.940
 I think we should actually save like 20 percent, 25 percent max on the rest of the planet.

2:25:27.940 --> 2:25:34.500
 We let life go on and evolve as it does without our interference, without our dominance.

2:25:34.500 --> 2:25:40.240
 Now that's neither a democratic system nor an authoritarian one.

2:25:40.240 --> 2:25:44.280
 It's one which starts off with saying the first thing humans have to do is respect life

2:25:44.280 --> 2:25:45.280
 itself.

2:25:45.280 --> 2:25:46.280
 Okay?

2:25:46.280 --> 2:25:50.060
 So would we do that?

2:25:50.060 --> 2:25:52.120
 We haven't done it, obviously.

2:25:52.120 --> 2:25:56.060
 I don't think the Soviets would have done it if we had a generally Soviet system.

2:25:56.060 --> 2:25:58.360
 We haven't done it under a capitalist.

2:25:58.360 --> 2:25:59.880
 We continue intruding.

2:25:59.880 --> 2:26:05.360
 So I think we have to go through something like a Star Trek, a Star Trek, you know, catastrophic

2:26:05.360 --> 2:26:10.120
 200 years to realize that ultimately if we're going to survive as a species, we have to

2:26:10.120 --> 2:26:12.080
 respect life in general.

2:26:12.080 --> 2:26:18.760
 And then that means parts of the planet we can no longer touch, while we also try to

2:26:18.760 --> 2:26:25.560
 maintain the planet at the temperature that we found it in what we now call the Anthropocene.

2:26:25.560 --> 2:26:34.000
 So politically, we have to have, like in many ways what native societies often have, a vision

2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:39.320
 of the cycle of life, not this exponential progression we've developed over the last

2:26:39.320 --> 2:26:42.080
 250 years.

2:26:42.080 --> 2:26:46.260
 And again, I'll use another movie, the Avatar type respect for the cycle of life.

2:26:46.260 --> 2:26:49.600
 We need to have that as part of our innate nature.

2:26:49.600 --> 2:26:53.840
 And then on top of that, the political system comes out.

2:26:53.840 --> 2:27:01.240
 Now that political system has to be one that lets us feel like we have a say in the direction

2:27:01.240 --> 2:27:04.400
 of society while that part is sacrosanct.

2:27:04.400 --> 2:27:06.080
 We can't touch it.

2:27:06.080 --> 2:27:10.800
 But we also, because we are now living with so many challenges created by our own civilization,

2:27:10.800 --> 2:27:17.000
 I mean, the main threat to the existence of human civilization is the existence of human

2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:18.000
 civilization.

2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:19.680
 Is both a feature and a bug.

2:27:19.680 --> 2:27:20.680
 Yeah.

2:27:20.680 --> 2:27:24.880
 And therefore, we need to have people who can understand complex systems making those

2:27:24.880 --> 2:27:25.880
 decisions.

2:27:25.880 --> 2:27:30.560
 Now that means it isn't a political system as much as it is an appreciation that the

2:27:30.560 --> 2:27:32.200
 world is a complex system.

2:27:32.200 --> 2:27:36.640
 And therefore, effects, which we think are direct effects, will actually come through

2:27:36.640 --> 2:27:38.440
 an oblique fashion.

2:27:38.440 --> 2:27:45.060
 And we cannot, there's no simple linear progression from where we are to where we want to be.

2:27:45.060 --> 2:27:47.880
 So you have to see how everything feeds together in a systemic way.

2:27:47.880 --> 2:27:51.600
 And that's why, one reason I designed this off where I'm wearing the tshirt for now,

2:27:51.600 --> 2:27:57.600
 Minsky, is to have, it's nowhere near to this scale, I hope it one way will be, but something

2:27:57.600 --> 2:28:01.040
 which means we can bring together all that complexity, all those systems, and perceive

2:28:01.040 --> 2:28:05.800
 them on an enormous screen where we have all the various interacts and we can see what

2:28:05.800 --> 2:28:08.900
 a potential future is.

2:28:08.900 --> 2:28:10.540
 And that then guides us.

2:28:10.540 --> 2:28:16.280
 So it isn't a case of democracy and, you know, our side wins a vote and therefore we ban

2:28:16.280 --> 2:28:19.600
 abortion or we don't, you know, whatever else happens.

2:28:19.600 --> 2:28:25.120
 It's seeing what the, respecting the fact that we're in a complex system, and being

2:28:25.120 --> 2:28:34.440
 uncertain about the consequences, and not making the bold, expansionary ideas that we've

2:28:34.440 --> 2:28:35.440
 been doing.

2:28:35.440 --> 2:28:41.920
 So like, being a little bit more, uh, humble.

2:28:41.920 --> 2:28:43.600
 Humble.

2:28:43.600 --> 2:28:44.720
 Humble is a good word.

2:28:44.720 --> 2:28:55.400
 But wouldn't you like to apply that same humility both to the considerations of the pros of

2:28:55.400 --> 2:29:00.840
 capitalism and to the catastrophic view of the effects of climate change?

2:29:00.840 --> 2:29:01.840
 Yeah.

2:29:01.840 --> 2:29:05.400
 And also, like, I think we can afford to be bold in space.

2:29:05.400 --> 2:29:10.480
 And that's one reason I respect the practical vision of Musk and so far impractical vision

2:29:10.480 --> 2:29:16.760
 of Bezos, that if we're going, we look for the very far future, the only way we can continue

2:29:16.760 --> 2:29:23.400
 expanding our knowledge of the universe is to move our civilization, the productive side

2:29:23.400 --> 2:29:24.600
 of off the planet.

2:29:24.600 --> 2:29:25.600
 Offsite backup.

2:29:25.600 --> 2:29:26.600
 Yeah.

2:29:26.600 --> 2:29:28.000
 So can you actually linger on this?

2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:29.880
 So let's actually talk about this.

2:29:29.880 --> 2:29:36.680
 So first of all, you have the new book, uh, humbly named, uh, named The New Economics

2:29:36.680 --> 2:29:38.720
 A Manifesto.

2:29:38.720 --> 2:29:39.720
 Publisher chose the title.

2:29:39.720 --> 2:29:40.720
 Yes.

2:29:40.720 --> 2:29:47.240
 No, but I'm joking, but, um, maybe I will ask you about why Manifesto, but we'll go

2:29:47.240 --> 2:29:48.840
 through some of the ideas in this book.

2:29:48.840 --> 2:29:56.880
 We have been already, uh, so some of it is embracing the fact that the economy, our world,

2:29:56.880 --> 2:29:58.520
 our mind is a complex system.

2:29:58.520 --> 2:30:06.520
 So this t shirt that you're wearing, yep, take it out, yeah, is, uh, the software I'll

2:30:06.520 --> 2:30:07.520
 do that.

2:30:07.520 --> 2:30:13.280
 There you go, there you go, you're wearing a, what is this, an infomercial?

2:30:13.280 --> 2:30:21.880
 So there's a t shirt that says Minsky, um, after not, not, not my Minsky, it's your

2:30:21.880 --> 2:30:22.880
 Minsky.

2:30:22.880 --> 2:30:23.880
 Not Hyman.

2:30:23.880 --> 2:30:25.520
 So no, the Hyman Minsky, not Marvin Minsky.

2:30:25.520 --> 2:30:26.720
 Not Marvin Minsky, right.

2:30:26.720 --> 2:30:33.900
 So that's, so AI Minsky is, is Marvin and then, uh, Harman, uh, it all rhymes.

2:30:33.900 --> 2:30:45.720
 So stability is free open source system dynamic software invented by Mr. Steve Keen, uh, coded

2:30:45.720 --> 2:30:51.120
 by Russell Standish, it's on SourceForge.

2:30:51.120 --> 2:30:52.120
 It's destabilizing.

2:30:52.120 --> 2:30:53.860
 Stability is destabilizing.

2:30:53.860 --> 2:30:58.280
 So that's sort of embracing the, the complex aspect of it.

2:30:58.280 --> 2:30:59.280
 Yeah.

2:30:59.280 --> 2:31:01.600
 So how can you model the economy?

2:31:01.600 --> 2:31:07.620
 What are some of the interesting, whether detailed or high level, big picture ideas

2:31:07.620 --> 2:31:10.480
 behind your efforts of Minsky?

2:31:10.480 --> 2:31:11.480
 Okay.

2:31:11.480 --> 2:31:16.600
 Minsky, um, meaning the software, the modeling software that, that models the dynamic system.

2:31:16.600 --> 2:31:19.980
 Basically what Minsky is doing is system dynamics modeling.

2:31:19.980 --> 2:31:26.200
 So it's, if anybody's used Stellar or Vensim or Simulink, um, then they've used exactly

2:31:26.200 --> 2:31:28.500
 the same family of software that Minsky is part of.

2:31:28.500 --> 2:31:29.500
 So I didn't invent that.

2:31:29.500 --> 2:31:33.480
 It was invented by Jay Forrester, who's one of the great intellects, one of the great

2:31:33.480 --> 2:31:36.600
 engineers, uh, in American history.

2:31:36.600 --> 2:31:41.640
 And the idea of, of, of Forrester's system was, uh, complex interactions.

2:31:41.640 --> 2:31:48.160
 So he was doing his work in the fifties, um, uh, if people don't know Forrester's work,

2:31:48.160 --> 2:31:53.200
 he actually built the models of the, um, uh, the, the mathematics for the gun turrets on

2:31:53.200 --> 2:31:57.580
 American warships in the second world war mechanical systems, obviously.

2:31:57.580 --> 2:32:01.720
 So he had to work out, you know, how to give a feedback system that meant when the boat

2:32:01.720 --> 2:32:05.400
 rolled in one direction, the, the tower did not roll the other way.

2:32:05.400 --> 2:32:06.960
 All that stuff was his work.

2:32:06.960 --> 2:32:08.480
 So marvelous engineering.

2:32:08.480 --> 2:32:13.320
 And then he realized if you want to look at a, even like a factory, a factory is a complex

2:32:13.320 --> 2:32:14.320
 system.

2:32:14.320 --> 2:32:18.000
 And so you get cycles generated out of the interaction between different components of

2:32:18.000 --> 2:32:22.160
 the factory that he was first involved in taming, that he built the software to model

2:32:22.160 --> 2:32:23.960
 complex interactive systems.

2:32:23.960 --> 2:32:27.920
 So Minsky is that, the thing that Minsky adds, which is unique is the Godley table.

2:32:27.920 --> 2:32:29.500
 And that's the double entry bookkeeping.

2:32:29.500 --> 2:32:34.000
 So you can model the financial system, Godley, the economist, Godley, the economy, Wynn Godley,

2:32:34.000 --> 2:32:35.740
 another great, great man.

2:32:35.740 --> 2:32:40.440
 So there, there's like this, so you're modeling it as like a state diagram.

2:32:40.440 --> 2:32:41.440
 Yeah.

2:32:41.440 --> 2:32:42.440
 Fundamentally.

2:32:42.440 --> 2:32:43.620
 It's actually, it is circuit diagrams.

2:32:43.620 --> 2:32:48.840
 It's exactly what engineers have been using for decades, almost a century.

2:32:48.840 --> 2:32:52.280
 So you're using a circuit diagram to model the economy.

2:32:52.280 --> 2:32:55.960
 And that's, that's the, so other factories have done it.

2:32:55.960 --> 2:33:01.200
 What they, what they haven't had in the circuit diagram is a way of handling the dynamics

2:33:01.200 --> 2:33:02.860
 of the financial system.

2:33:02.860 --> 2:33:09.040
 So what the Godley table does is bring it financial flows as being everything goes from

2:33:09.040 --> 2:33:11.400
 somewhere and ends up somewhere.

2:33:11.400 --> 2:33:16.840
 So you have a positive and a negative, if you're looking on the liability side, a positive

2:33:16.840 --> 2:33:20.960
 and a positive or negative and a negative, you're looking at assets and liabilities side

2:33:20.960 --> 2:33:22.920
 and Minsky gets the accounting right for that.

2:33:22.920 --> 2:33:27.640
 So you can do an enormous complex model looking at the economy financially from the point

2:33:27.640 --> 2:33:32.680
 of view of a dozen different actors in the economy and know that the mathematics is right.

2:33:32.680 --> 2:33:36.400
 Even though what you're building is set of differential equations, which might be 50

2:33:36.400 --> 2:33:40.020
 differential equations with 350 terms in them.

2:33:40.020 --> 2:33:43.540
 If you've got the Godley tables right, you know the mathematics is correct.

2:33:43.540 --> 2:33:45.680
 So that's the main innovation that Minsky adds.

2:33:45.680 --> 2:33:48.680
 And you're operating there at the macroeconomics level.

2:33:48.680 --> 2:33:49.680
 Yeah.

2:33:49.680 --> 2:33:50.680
 It's definitely macro.

2:33:50.680 --> 2:33:52.760
 It's not agent based.

2:33:52.760 --> 2:33:57.320
 And then this, I'm just open on random page that I think is very relevant here.

2:33:57.320 --> 2:34:01.160
 The process, this is referring to Minsky, not the software, maybe the software.

2:34:01.160 --> 2:34:02.160
 I don't know.

2:34:02.160 --> 2:34:05.920
 The process can be captured in an extremely simple causal chain.

2:34:05.920 --> 2:34:08.180
 Capital determines output, output determines employment.

2:34:08.180 --> 2:34:11.440
 The rate of employment determines the rate of change of wages.

2:34:11.440 --> 2:34:14.400
 Output minus wages and interest payments determines profit.

2:34:14.400 --> 2:34:17.960
 The profit rate determines the, there's a very nice circuit here.

2:34:17.960 --> 2:34:23.560
 The profit rate determines the level of investment, which is the change in capital, which takes

2:34:23.560 --> 2:34:26.240
 us back to the beginning of this causal chain.

2:34:26.240 --> 2:34:32.600
 And the difference between investment and profits determines the change in private debt.

2:34:32.600 --> 2:34:38.920
 And there's some nice, the Keen Minsky model and the intermittent route to chaos on page

2:34:38.920 --> 2:34:40.520
 86 of your book.

2:34:40.520 --> 2:34:42.480
 These are, do these come from the software?

2:34:42.480 --> 2:34:43.480
 Yeah.

2:34:43.480 --> 2:34:44.480
 Yeah.

2:34:44.480 --> 2:34:50.280
 I was a mathematician back in 1992, August, 1992.

2:34:50.280 --> 2:34:52.000
 Mathematics is another amazing piece of software.

2:34:52.000 --> 2:34:53.000
 Yeah.

2:34:53.000 --> 2:34:55.160
 And I find it, it's very much a programmer's approach to mathematics.

2:34:55.160 --> 2:35:00.680
 I prefer like a program called Mathcad, which is what I'm using for all my, when I do my

2:35:00.680 --> 2:35:04.040
 mathematics on the computer, I write in Mathcad.

2:35:04.040 --> 2:35:05.600
 CAD or CAB?

2:35:05.600 --> 2:35:06.600
 CAD.

2:35:06.600 --> 2:35:07.600
 Okay.

2:35:07.600 --> 2:35:09.400
 It's been ruined by bad management.

2:35:09.400 --> 2:35:13.560
 They chucked out all the good engineers and I'm still using a version which is 12 years

2:35:13.560 --> 2:35:14.560
 old.

2:35:14.560 --> 2:35:16.520
 If only engineers ruled the world.

2:35:16.520 --> 2:35:20.640
 If only engineers, rather than this particular case, there was a bunch of marketers for CAD

2:35:20.640 --> 2:35:22.220
 software agreed.

2:35:22.220 --> 2:35:24.020
 I'm definitely a fan of engineers.

2:35:24.020 --> 2:35:26.160
 What are the plots that we're looking at here?

2:35:26.160 --> 2:35:31.400
 Growth rate, private debt ratio, employment versus wages, employment versus debt, income

2:35:31.400 --> 2:35:32.400
 distribution.

2:35:32.400 --> 2:35:36.160
 So this is across years, like different trade offs.

2:35:36.160 --> 2:35:39.480
 Is there something interesting to say about the plots and the insights from those plots

2:35:39.480 --> 2:35:41.920
 that are generated by the software?

2:35:41.920 --> 2:35:46.200
 That's a particular parameter value is to give that outcome.

2:35:46.200 --> 2:35:50.380
 But what happened when I first simulated the model, I took a model by a guy called Richard

2:35:50.380 --> 2:35:56.920
 Goodwin who's one of the great neglected economists, American Marxist, mathematical Marxist.

2:35:56.920 --> 2:35:59.420
 And what he did was build a model of cycles.

2:35:59.420 --> 2:36:06.200
 And he actually wrote a paper called, it's only about a five page paper published in

2:36:06.200 --> 2:36:09.700
 a book and a very, very obscure conference paper.

2:36:09.700 --> 2:36:13.660
 And what he was doing was trying to build a model of Marx.

2:36:13.660 --> 2:36:19.840
 So he wrote it in 1967 and it was putting into mathematical form a model that Marx came

2:36:19.840 --> 2:36:21.700
 up with in 1867.

2:36:21.700 --> 2:36:24.360
 So it was a centenary birthday present to Marx.

2:36:24.360 --> 2:36:35.780
 And what Marx had argued in chapter 25, I think, of volume one of Capital, section three,

2:36:35.780 --> 2:36:39.140
 he built a verbal model of a cyclical system.

2:36:39.140 --> 2:36:41.600
 And it's quite out of character with the rest of the book.

2:36:41.600 --> 2:36:47.600
 So when you read volume one of Capital, people think Marx has got a commodity view of money.

2:36:47.600 --> 2:36:50.420
 He doesn't at all.

2:36:50.420 --> 2:36:53.840
 The idea was he had like an onion, you start off on the middle level and you ignore the

2:36:53.840 --> 2:36:56.480
 outer layer, then you bring the outer layer and so on and so forth.

2:36:56.480 --> 2:37:01.520
 Anyway, in this model, in volume one of Capital, he normally just assumed work has got a subsistence

2:37:01.520 --> 2:37:02.520
 wage.

2:37:02.520 --> 2:37:03.520
 That's it.

2:37:03.520 --> 2:37:09.800
 In this little chapter, he said that if the economy is, effectively he said, the economy

2:37:09.800 --> 2:37:14.200
 is booming, then workers will demand wage rises.

2:37:14.200 --> 2:37:18.580
 And the wage rises will cut into the profit so that capitalists will not get the level

2:37:18.580 --> 2:37:20.520
 of profit they're expecting.

2:37:20.520 --> 2:37:23.800
 Therefore they will invest less and the economy will slump.

2:37:23.800 --> 2:37:28.920
 And the slump will mean workers become unemployed and have to accept wage cuts.

2:37:28.920 --> 2:37:31.140
 And it was a model of a cyclical economy.

2:37:31.140 --> 2:37:35.720
 And as it happens, Marx spent his later years trying to learn enough calculus to be able

2:37:35.720 --> 2:37:37.780
 to model it himself mathematically.

2:37:37.780 --> 2:37:38.780
 And he never managed.

2:37:38.780 --> 2:37:42.880
 There's Marx's mathematical notes on calculus, which are quite fun to read if you have a

2:37:42.880 --> 2:37:43.880
 mathematical background.

2:37:43.880 --> 2:37:44.880
 Did he get far?

2:37:44.880 --> 2:37:45.880
 Far?

2:37:45.880 --> 2:37:46.880
 Far?

2:37:46.880 --> 2:37:47.880
 No.

2:37:47.880 --> 2:37:50.560
 He got too caught up in the whole philosophy and never really got to build the model.

2:37:50.560 --> 2:37:54.240
 But what Goodman realized was a predator prey model.

2:37:54.240 --> 2:37:55.240
 Okay.

2:37:55.240 --> 2:37:57.920
 The Locta Volterra model was the basis of the idea.

2:37:57.920 --> 2:38:07.400
 So the idea is you have a prey, and the example that Locta actually used initially was grass.

2:38:07.400 --> 2:38:08.680
 Grass is the prey.

2:38:08.680 --> 2:38:12.200
 And then you have a predator, and the predator were cows.

2:38:12.200 --> 2:38:15.560
 So you start off with a very few cows, lots of grass.

2:38:15.560 --> 2:38:19.300
 And then because of lots of grass, the numbers of cows grow.

2:38:19.300 --> 2:38:21.720
 And then because the cows grow, they start to eat the grass.

2:38:21.720 --> 2:38:25.420
 So the grass runs out, so the cows starve, and you get a cycle.

2:38:25.420 --> 2:38:28.860
 And what Locta was amazed by was that the cycles were persistent.

2:38:28.860 --> 2:38:30.060
 They didn't die out.

2:38:30.060 --> 2:38:33.940
 So Goodman got that vision, and he then built a predator prey model.

2:38:33.940 --> 2:38:37.960
 And I, first of all, read Goodman and really found it really hard to follow his writing.

2:38:37.960 --> 2:38:42.880
 He's not a very good writer, but a guy called John Blatt, who was a professor of mathematics

2:38:42.880 --> 2:38:48.500
 at New South Wales University, wrote a brilliant explanation of Goodman's model in a book called

2:38:48.500 --> 2:38:49.720
 Dynamic Economic Systems.

2:38:49.720 --> 2:38:50.720
 And I read that.

2:38:50.720 --> 2:38:55.900
 It was superb, and he said a way he could extend this was to include finance.

2:38:55.900 --> 2:39:00.460
 So I thought, okay, what I'm going to have is that what Goodman presumed is capitalists

2:39:00.460 --> 2:39:02.740
 invest all their profits.

2:39:02.740 --> 2:39:08.620
 So you get a boom when there's a high rate of profit because they invest all that money,

2:39:08.620 --> 2:39:13.300
 and then a slump when there's low profit because depreciation will wipe away capital and you'll

2:39:13.300 --> 2:39:14.840
 go boom and slump.

2:39:14.840 --> 2:39:21.100
 So I simply added in, well, capitalists will invest more than their profits during a boom,

2:39:21.100 --> 2:39:23.760
 but less than their profits during a slump.

2:39:23.760 --> 2:39:27.220
 And that therefore means they had to borrow money to finance the gap and pay interest

2:39:27.220 --> 2:39:28.340
 on the debt.

2:39:28.340 --> 2:39:32.660
 So I ended up with a model with just three systems states, the income share, the wages

2:39:32.660 --> 2:39:38.260
 distribution of income between workers, capitalists, and bankers, the level of employment, and

2:39:38.260 --> 2:39:40.540
 the level of private debt.

2:39:40.540 --> 2:39:45.620
 And those three equations are fundamentally like going from the Locke to Volterra model

2:39:45.620 --> 2:39:50.380
 with just two equations, and therefore you get a fixed cycle, to the Lorenz model where

2:39:50.380 --> 2:39:51.920
 you have three.

2:39:51.920 --> 2:39:54.300
 And therefore what I got out of it was a chaotic outcome.

2:39:54.300 --> 2:40:00.560
 So what you're seeing is a manifestation of chaos, complexity in those plots.

2:40:00.560 --> 2:40:08.740
 But one of the many fascinating parts about it was that as the level of private debt rose,

2:40:08.740 --> 2:40:12.860
 in my model I had capitalists being the only ones who borrowed, but the people who paid

2:40:12.860 --> 2:40:17.460
 for the high level of private debt were the workers.

2:40:17.460 --> 2:40:22.780
 The rising banker's share corresponded exactly to a falling worker's share.

2:40:22.780 --> 2:40:26.580
 So you can infer from that that the workers are the ones paying.

2:40:26.580 --> 2:40:28.020
 Effectively, the workers end up paying for it.

2:40:28.020 --> 2:40:30.220
 They get a lower level of wages.

2:40:30.220 --> 2:40:36.120
 And the basic dynamic is that capitalists, when you have a three social class system,

2:40:36.120 --> 2:40:38.820
 your income goes between workers, capitalists, and bankers.

2:40:38.820 --> 2:40:41.860
 Now in the system, the good one did, they're just workers and capitalists.

2:40:41.860 --> 2:40:45.380
 So if workers share rose, capitalists share had to fall.

2:40:45.380 --> 2:40:49.180
 But when you have three social classes, then capitalists share can remain constant while

2:40:49.180 --> 2:40:53.580
 workers fall and bankers rise.

2:40:53.580 --> 2:40:55.580
 So that's what actually happened.

2:40:55.580 --> 2:40:59.580
 Because capitalists, the simple way I modeled it was there's a certain rate of profit at

2:40:59.580 --> 2:41:02.180
 which capitalists invest all their profits.

2:41:02.180 --> 2:41:05.620
 Above that they borrow more, below that they pay off debt.

2:41:05.620 --> 2:41:09.820
 So what would happen is when you got back to that point, then the level of investment

2:41:09.820 --> 2:41:13.260
 would be a precise share of GDP.

2:41:13.260 --> 2:41:15.980
 And therefore you'd get a precise rate of economic growth.

2:41:15.980 --> 2:41:20.740
 But if there was a higher percentage going to bankers and offset by a lower share going

2:41:20.740 --> 2:41:23.140
 to workers, it didn't affect the capitalists.

2:41:23.140 --> 2:41:31.720
 So what you get is the cycles sort of diminish for a while because there's the income distribution

2:41:31.720 --> 2:41:32.720
 effect is important.

2:41:32.720 --> 2:41:37.140
 So the workers pay for the increasing level of debt.

2:41:37.140 --> 2:41:40.580
 But the other side of it was that the cycles would diminish for a while.

2:41:40.580 --> 2:41:45.660
 Now what you get is a period of diminishing cycles, then leading to rising cycles.

2:41:45.660 --> 2:41:53.840
 And technically this is known as the Pomeranville route to chaos, and it's one particular element

2:41:53.840 --> 2:41:57.580
 of Lorenzo's equations of fluid dynamics.

2:41:57.580 --> 2:42:03.380
 So what they found was in examining laminar flow in a fluid, you have a period where the

2:42:03.380 --> 2:42:09.760
 laminar flow got more laminar, and then suddenly it'd start to get less laminar and go turbulent.

2:42:09.760 --> 2:42:14.500
 And this is what actually goes on in the model, so in my model of Minsky.

2:42:14.500 --> 2:42:19.800
 So what you have is a period where there's big berms and cycles, and then as the debt

2:42:19.800 --> 2:42:23.640
 level rises, the berms and slumps get smaller.

2:42:23.640 --> 2:42:28.000
 And that looks like what neoclassical economists call the Great Moderation.

2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:33.780
 So when I first modeled this in 1982, I finished up my paper, which was published in 95, with

2:42:33.780 --> 2:42:38.940
 what I thought was a nice rhetorical flourish, saying the chaotic dynamics of this paper

2:42:38.940 --> 2:42:43.380
 should warn us against regarding a period of relative stability in a capitalist economy

2:42:43.380 --> 2:42:45.580
 as anything more than a lull before the storm.

2:42:45.580 --> 2:42:50.140
 Now I thought it was a great speed of rhetoric, I didn't think it was going to fucking happen.

2:42:50.140 --> 2:42:56.360
 But it did, because you had this period from 1990 through to 2007 where there were diminishing

2:42:56.360 --> 2:43:00.420
 cycles, and the neoclassicals labeled that the Great Moderation, and they took the credit

2:43:00.420 --> 2:43:01.420
 for it.

2:43:01.420 --> 2:43:06.500
 They thought that the economy was being managed by them to a lower rate of inflation, a lower

2:43:06.500 --> 2:43:11.460
 level of unemployment, less instability over time, and they literally took credit for it.

2:43:11.460 --> 2:43:14.980
 And I was watching that and thinking, that's like my model running, and I'm scared as

2:43:14.980 --> 2:43:17.540
 shit that there'll be a breakdown.

2:43:17.540 --> 2:43:23.380
 I ended up not working in the area for a while because I wrote Debunking Economics, and I

2:43:23.380 --> 2:43:28.780
 got involved in a fight over the modeling of competition in neoclassical theory that

2:43:28.780 --> 2:43:31.340
 took me away for about four or five years.

2:43:31.340 --> 2:43:40.260
 And then I got asked to do a court case in 2005, end of 2005, and I used Minsky as my

2:43:40.260 --> 2:43:44.880
 framework for arguing that somebody who was involved in predatory lending should be able

2:43:44.880 --> 2:43:47.460
 to get out of the debt they were in.

2:43:47.460 --> 2:43:52.700
 And I explained Minsky's theory, and I used this throwaway line of saying debt levels

2:43:52.700 --> 2:43:55.860
 of private debt have been rising exponentially.

2:43:55.860 --> 2:43:59.380
 And then I thought, well, I can't, as an expert, just make a claim like that.

2:43:59.380 --> 2:44:01.380
 I've got to check the data.

2:44:01.380 --> 2:44:05.700
 And the debt ratio was rising exponentially, and I thought, holy shit, we're in for a financial

2:44:05.700 --> 2:44:10.860
 crisis, and somebody has to warn about it, and at least in Australia, I was that somebody.

2:44:10.860 --> 2:44:16.700
 So can you, given this chaotic dynamics idea, can you talk about the crises ahead of us

2:44:16.700 --> 2:44:17.700
 in the future?

2:44:17.700 --> 2:44:21.820
 So one of the things, I mean, it's a fundamental question of economics.

2:44:21.820 --> 2:44:26.380
 Is economics about understanding the past or predicting the future?

2:44:26.380 --> 2:44:37.540
 Because you can construct models that do poetic, like in 95, poetic, you know, yeah, and then

2:44:37.540 --> 2:44:43.860
 you can, you know, watch years fly by, and some of the predictions in retrospect that

2:44:43.860 --> 2:44:49.980
 you make turn out to be true, but, you know, all kinds of gurus throughout history have

2:44:49.980 --> 2:44:54.860
 done that kind of thing, and you can call yourself right and forget all the many times

2:44:54.860 --> 2:44:56.460
 you've been wrong.

2:44:56.460 --> 2:44:57.840
 Let's talk about the future.

2:44:57.840 --> 2:45:02.540
 What kind of stuff, you mentioned about the importance of the biosphere, but what are

2:45:02.540 --> 2:45:10.660
 the crises that are ahead of us that a chaotic dynamics view allows us to predict and be

2:45:10.660 --> 2:45:11.660
 concerned about?

2:45:11.660 --> 2:45:17.980
 Getting out of it, leaving aside the ecological, wasn't a crisis, it was stagnation.

2:45:17.980 --> 2:45:23.300
 Because what we got out of the crisis was caused by a rising level of private debt.

2:45:23.300 --> 2:45:29.700
 Now you reach a peak level where the willingness to take on debt collapses.

2:45:29.700 --> 2:45:32.940
 And so you go to a period where debt is rising all the time.

2:45:32.940 --> 2:45:38.300
 So credit, which is the annual change in debt, and that's credit as part of aggregate demand

2:45:38.300 --> 2:45:39.980
 and aggregate income.

2:45:39.980 --> 2:45:44.740
 So credit goes from positive to negative, and that causes a slump.

2:45:44.740 --> 2:45:47.060
 So can you describe why that causes a slump?

2:45:47.060 --> 2:45:49.420
 So credit goes to negative.

2:45:49.420 --> 2:45:53.180
 If you ask Paul Krugman, he'll tell you credit plays no role in aggregate demand.

2:45:53.180 --> 2:45:55.960
 Give me a second.

2:45:55.960 --> 2:45:58.780
 Credit plays no role in aggregate demand.

2:45:58.780 --> 2:46:02.660
 So the vision that the neoclassicals have for the banking system is what they call learnable

2:46:02.660 --> 2:46:03.660
 funds.

2:46:03.660 --> 2:46:10.460
 Is Paul Krugman, by the way, the knight at the front of the army that is the neoclassical

2:46:10.460 --> 2:46:11.460
 economist?

2:46:11.460 --> 2:46:12.460
 Yeah, fundamentally.

2:46:12.460 --> 2:46:13.460
 Sure.

2:46:13.460 --> 2:46:14.460
 Okay.

2:46:14.460 --> 2:46:21.360
 He's politically reasonable, which makes him more dangerous than those that aren't.

2:46:21.360 --> 2:46:22.360
 He's politically...

2:46:22.360 --> 2:46:25.660
 Yeah, there's quite a lot of people that would disagree with that characterization of Paul

2:46:25.660 --> 2:46:28.300
 Krugman as he's politically reasonable.

2:46:28.300 --> 2:46:29.300
 You should see the people behind him.

2:46:29.300 --> 2:46:30.300
 The alternatives.

2:46:30.300 --> 2:46:31.300
 Okay.

2:46:31.300 --> 2:46:32.300
 Fair enough.

2:46:32.300 --> 2:46:33.300
 Okay.

2:46:33.300 --> 2:46:36.420
 So he's not a negative or positive statement, that's just he can be feisty as well.

2:46:36.420 --> 2:46:37.420
 Oh, he can.

2:46:37.420 --> 2:46:38.420
 He can.

2:46:38.420 --> 2:46:40.780
 But he's like the human face of neoclassical economics.

2:46:40.780 --> 2:46:43.020
 It doesn't deserve having a human face.

2:46:43.020 --> 2:46:45.260
 It's anti human theory.

2:46:45.260 --> 2:46:46.260
 But he's the human face.

2:46:46.260 --> 2:46:47.260
 Tell me what you really think.

2:46:47.260 --> 2:46:48.260
 I got you.

2:46:48.260 --> 2:46:49.260
 All right.

2:46:49.260 --> 2:46:54.300
 Well, so but the credit does not have any effect on aggregate demand.

2:46:54.300 --> 2:46:55.300
 In their model.

2:46:55.300 --> 2:46:56.900
 And you're saying that's not the case at all.

2:46:56.900 --> 2:46:59.000
 It's absolutely crucial to aggregate demand.

2:46:59.000 --> 2:47:03.420
 So what they model is, again, the example of you lending to me or vice versa.

2:47:03.420 --> 2:47:07.660
 If I lend money to you, I can spend less, you can spend more.

2:47:07.660 --> 2:47:11.020
 So credit is the change in debt.

2:47:11.020 --> 2:47:17.100
 So if I lend money to you, then there's a level of private debt rises.

2:47:17.100 --> 2:47:19.000
 So there's an increase in credit.

2:47:19.000 --> 2:47:22.820
 But that increase in credit comes at an expense of my spending power.

2:47:22.820 --> 2:47:26.860
 So you can spend what I've lent you, but I can't spend what I've lent you.

2:47:26.860 --> 2:47:28.700
 So credit cancels out.

2:47:28.700 --> 2:47:30.600
 When you look at that's learnable funds.

2:47:30.600 --> 2:47:34.180
 But in the real world, and the Bank of England has said this is the real world and the textbooks

2:47:34.180 --> 2:47:38.900
 are wrong categorically in 2014.

2:47:38.900 --> 2:47:43.940
 When the bank lends, it adds to its asset side and says, you owe us more money.

2:47:43.940 --> 2:47:47.340
 And it adds to its liability side and says, here's the money in your bank account.

2:47:47.340 --> 2:47:49.420
 Now you spend that money.

2:47:49.420 --> 2:47:54.380
 So what happens when you do your sums, credit is part of aggregate demand and aggregate

2:47:54.380 --> 2:47:55.380
 income.

2:47:55.380 --> 2:48:02.160
 And that's something I first solved in 2019, I think, 2000, I only recently proved it mathematically.

2:48:02.160 --> 2:48:08.540
 So what that means is credit is a component of aggregate demand, and credit is also very

2:48:08.540 --> 2:48:09.540
 volatile.

2:48:09.540 --> 2:48:14.140
 It's like consumption demand never goes negative, investment demand never goes negative, but

2:48:14.140 --> 2:48:15.700
 credit can go from positive to negative.

2:48:15.700 --> 2:48:21.620
 And when you take a look at the long run of American history after the Second World War,

2:48:21.620 --> 2:48:26.740
 there was no period until 2007 where credit was negative.

2:48:26.740 --> 2:48:34.000
 It was a positive number, therefore, when you do it as a percentage of GDP, it was a

2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:36.360
 positive percentage of GDP.

2:48:36.360 --> 2:48:42.840
 It peaked at 16% of GDP in 2006, 2007.

2:48:42.840 --> 2:48:47.500
 It fell to minus 5% in 2008, 2009.

2:48:47.500 --> 2:48:51.980
 So you had a 20% of GDP turnaround in aggregate demand.

2:48:51.980 --> 2:49:00.060
 Now when you plot that against unemployment, the correlation of credit to unemployment

2:49:00.060 --> 2:49:09.300
 across the period from about 1990 to 2010 is about minus 0.9, okay?

2:49:09.300 --> 2:49:10.520
 Enormous negative correlation.

2:49:10.520 --> 2:49:14.380
 Now according to the neoclassicals, it should be close to zero.

2:49:14.380 --> 2:49:16.180
 Empirically it's bleedingly obvious it's not.

2:49:16.180 --> 2:49:21.540
 And it applies to every country in the world that had a financial crisis at that period.

2:49:21.540 --> 2:49:24.740
 So it's bleedingly obvious in the data.

2:49:24.740 --> 2:49:28.180
 And they ignore it because credit's not part of their model.

2:49:28.180 --> 2:49:29.180
 And you're saying it's causation.

2:49:29.180 --> 2:49:31.900
 It is causal.

2:49:31.900 --> 2:49:35.980
 Today we sit there, it's extremely high inflation.

2:49:35.980 --> 2:49:41.500
 What role does inflation play in this picture?

2:49:41.500 --> 2:49:43.060
 Is a little bit of inflation good?

2:49:43.060 --> 2:49:48.380
 We talked about money creation at the beginning.

2:49:48.380 --> 2:49:50.500
 What's a little bit of inflation good or bad?

2:49:50.500 --> 2:49:52.220
 A lot of inflation good or bad?

2:49:52.220 --> 2:49:53.220
 How concerned are you about?

2:49:53.220 --> 2:49:57.420
 A little bit is good for a simple reason that, like again, it's taken me a while to get my

2:49:57.420 --> 2:49:58.720
 head around this.

2:49:58.720 --> 2:50:01.500
 But if you think about how people say, what are the functions of money?

2:50:01.500 --> 2:50:04.780
 They say money, it's a unit of account, so you're measuring.

2:50:04.780 --> 2:50:06.980
 It's a means of exchange, okay?

2:50:06.980 --> 2:50:09.300
 And it's a store of value, okay?

2:50:09.300 --> 2:50:15.060
 Now yes, okay, it has those three roles, but the last one is contradictory to the previous

2:50:15.060 --> 2:50:16.060
 two.

2:50:16.060 --> 2:50:20.440
 Because, and this is where you see this with the Bitcoin phenomenon, if you want to hang

2:50:20.440 --> 2:50:29.740
 onto money as a store of value, then if prices are falling, the value of money is rising.

2:50:29.740 --> 2:50:35.340
 And it's actually in your interests as a store of value to hang onto it and not spend it.

2:50:35.340 --> 2:50:39.280
 So that contradicts its role as a means of exchange.

2:50:39.280 --> 2:50:44.320
 Now if you have money which depreciates, and this was actually tried in the Austrian town

2:50:44.320 --> 2:50:48.420
 of Wargel during the Great Depression.

2:50:48.420 --> 2:50:53.300
 If you have money that depreciates, then if you don't use it, you lose it fundamentally.

2:50:53.300 --> 2:50:55.500
 So it has a high rate of circulation.

2:50:55.500 --> 2:51:01.740
 So there's a monetary theorist called Silvio Gazzell, and he wrote this proposal that money

2:51:01.740 --> 2:51:03.940
 should depreciate.

2:51:03.940 --> 2:51:09.640
 And he was ridiculed and opposed and derided, but Keynes said he was a great intellect.

2:51:09.640 --> 2:51:15.660
 And the mayor of the town of Wargel in Austria during the Great Depression was facing an

2:51:15.660 --> 2:51:18.760
 unemployment rate of 25% pretty much.

2:51:18.760 --> 2:51:23.700
 Germany had the worst experience in the Great Depression in the world, as bad as America,

2:51:23.700 --> 2:51:25.600
 slightly worse than America.

2:51:25.600 --> 2:51:28.600
 And so he thought, how can I stimulate demand here?

2:51:28.600 --> 2:51:33.500
 So he produced a script which could only be used for buying goods and services in Wargel.

2:51:33.500 --> 2:51:37.460
 And it could be used to pay your local rates.

2:51:37.460 --> 2:51:41.460
 But it was depreciated by putting a stamp on the money if you didn't use it.

2:51:41.460 --> 2:51:45.720
 So what happened was people would pay their rates, they needed to pay the rates using

2:51:45.720 --> 2:51:49.180
 this money, so the script, so they used the script.

2:51:49.180 --> 2:51:52.760
 And because it depreciated, you'd use it rapidly.

2:51:52.760 --> 2:51:58.240
 So people were using that money, this alternative to the Austrian shilling, and the economic

2:51:58.240 --> 2:52:02.040
 activity in town took off, and unemployment fell to zero.

2:52:02.040 --> 2:52:06.040
 And it was an absolute miracle, and everybody loved a Wargel experiment, and the Austrian

2:52:06.040 --> 2:52:12.160
 central bank sued them for establishing an alternative form of money and shut it down.

2:52:12.160 --> 2:52:20.280
 Unemployment went back up to 25% again, and Austria voted 99.6% for the Nazis, something

2:52:20.280 --> 2:52:22.920
 crazy number like that when Hitler marched in.

2:52:22.920 --> 2:52:29.720
 So the Wargel experiment showed that a depreciating currency led to a high rate of circulation.

2:52:29.720 --> 2:52:33.700
 But of course, we're not talking Weimar Republic levels of inflation.

2:52:33.700 --> 2:52:40.340
 So when you get that much inflation, and that's normally caused by, as the Weimar inflation

2:52:40.340 --> 2:52:46.080
 was caused by, the reparation terms imposed on Germany, fundamentally by France at the

2:52:46.080 --> 2:52:52.140
 Treaty of Versailles, they paid a large part of that with just basically printing the notes,

2:52:52.140 --> 2:52:54.900
 and you went into this crazy period of hyperinflation.

2:52:54.900 --> 2:52:58.480
 So hyperinflation almost always occurs when there's a massive destruction of physical

2:52:58.480 --> 2:53:03.040
 resources, and the monetary authority tries to paper, literally, over it, and then you

2:53:03.040 --> 2:53:05.760
 get hyperinflation, that's total social breakdown.

2:53:05.760 --> 2:53:12.560
 So a moderate level of inflation inspires the means of exchange usage of money, but

2:53:12.560 --> 2:53:17.560
 undermines the store of value usage of money.

2:53:17.560 --> 2:53:22.760
 And that dilemma is why we have this antagonistic attitude towards inflation.

2:53:22.760 --> 2:53:31.120
 Yeah, I mean, you're describing it as a tension, but it nevertheless is, like money is a store

2:53:31.120 --> 2:53:36.600
 of value and a means of exchange, and I don't, you know, to push back, it's not necessarily

2:53:36.600 --> 2:53:42.360
 that there's a tension, it's just that depending on the dynamics of this beautiful economic

2:53:42.360 --> 2:53:45.800
 system of ours, it's used as one more than the other.

2:53:45.800 --> 2:53:53.380
 If there's inflation, you're using it more for the means of exchange, there's deflation

2:53:53.380 --> 2:53:57.560
 using more for store of value, but that doesn't, I don't see that as a tension, that's just

2:53:57.560 --> 2:54:00.800
 a, how much you use it for those different, like...

2:54:00.800 --> 2:54:07.240
 But it ends up saying that overall, the level of effective commerce, a bit of inflation

2:54:07.240 --> 2:54:11.400
 is a good thing, because that's depreciating the money slightly and encourage its use.

2:54:11.400 --> 2:54:20.400
 Yeah, but so the argument that some Bitcoin folks use or gold standard folks, again, HODL

2:54:20.400 --> 2:54:29.320
 is not an argument, is that having an inflation of zero is actually achieving that balance.

2:54:29.320 --> 2:54:30.320
 Yeah.

2:54:30.320 --> 2:54:31.320
 Right?

2:54:31.320 --> 2:54:32.320
 So like, yeah.

2:54:32.320 --> 2:54:36.200
 But they're actually in favor of negative, they want it to be appreciated rapidly, and

2:54:36.200 --> 2:54:42.980
 because of the negative inflation, the value of the money rising relative to commodities,

2:54:42.980 --> 2:54:45.480
 that's what they want, that's the HODL philosophy.

2:54:45.480 --> 2:54:50.380
 Well, that's more of like an investment, I don't know if that, that's more of investment

2:54:50.380 --> 2:54:55.680
 philosophy than the fundamental principles of why they believe in cryptocurrency, in

2:54:55.680 --> 2:54:58.140
 forced scarcity, it's a model.

2:54:58.140 --> 2:55:04.040
 The concern there is that when you print money, the public policy is detached from the actual

2:55:04.040 --> 2:55:06.480
 value.

2:55:06.480 --> 2:55:12.720
 Yeah, well, I mean, this is where, again, it matters to get money creation right, because

2:55:12.720 --> 2:55:19.000
 the government's not the only money creator, banks are as well, private banks.

2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:25.160
 And if we obsess too much about limiting government money creation, what we end up getting, if

2:55:25.160 --> 2:55:28.920
 there is money creation going on, it's private banks doing it, and you get an increase in

2:55:28.920 --> 2:55:36.720
 private debt, and fundamentally, private debt and its collapse, the collapse of credit,

2:55:36.720 --> 2:55:41.200
 when it stops growing, that's the fundamental cause of financial crises.

2:55:41.200 --> 2:55:46.240
 So yeah, but the question is, what's the cause for the collapse of the...

2:55:46.240 --> 2:55:51.820
 Well, I think this is like the Austrian thinking leaves out the debt deflation.

2:55:51.820 --> 2:55:56.640
 And that's like, I think one of the most important papers ever written was by Irving Fisher called

2:55:56.640 --> 2:55:59.640
 the Debt Deflation Theory of Great Depressions.

2:55:59.640 --> 2:56:02.640
 Fisher was somebody who accepted the neoclassical vision.

2:56:02.640 --> 2:56:09.300
 He wrote the pre Efficiency Market Hypothesis, Efficiency Market Hypothesis.

2:56:09.300 --> 2:56:14.680
 He had his own PhD called the Theory of Interest.

2:56:14.680 --> 2:56:21.940
 And in that, he argued effectively for a supply and demand analysis of the financial system.

2:56:21.940 --> 2:56:27.480
 And he argued for equilibrium, he said when you're working with a commodity market, then

2:56:27.480 --> 2:56:35.040
 the sale and the transaction and the exchange occur at the same point in time.

2:56:35.040 --> 2:56:39.520
 When you're working with the financial market, then the exchange occurs through time.

2:56:39.520 --> 2:56:46.680
 So he said he assumed that debts are repaid, all debts are repaid, and he assumed that

2:56:46.680 --> 2:56:50.200
 equilibrium through time was an essential part of his assumption.

2:56:50.200 --> 2:56:54.680
 This is...and then the Great Depression comes along.

2:56:54.680 --> 2:57:00.640
 And he has become a major shareholder in the rank Xerox because he invented the Roller

2:57:00.640 --> 2:57:01.640
 Dex.

2:57:01.640 --> 2:57:03.600
 He's a tinkerer.

2:57:03.600 --> 2:57:09.720
 And so he had taken out shares on margin, and he was worth about 100 million in modern

2:57:09.720 --> 2:57:12.480
 terms when the Great Depression hit.

2:57:12.480 --> 2:57:14.920
 And 90% of that was share market valuation.

2:57:14.920 --> 2:57:18.120
 He'd taken out margin debt just like everybody else.

2:57:18.120 --> 2:57:24.120
 And with margin debt, you could put down $100,000 and buy a million dollars worth of shares.

2:57:24.120 --> 2:57:27.120
 So you got this huge leverage into debt.

2:57:27.120 --> 2:57:30.720
 Now that when the financial crisis hit, the level of margin debt in America had risen

2:57:30.720 --> 2:57:38.660
 from half a percent of GDP in 1920 to 13% of GDP in 1929.

2:57:38.660 --> 2:57:40.460
 It then fell to zero again.

2:57:40.460 --> 2:57:46.520
 That's why the stock market crash in 1929 was so devastating, that scale of margin lending.

2:57:46.520 --> 2:57:49.960
 And everybody was being wiped out, they were selling Rolls Royces for 20 quid.

2:57:49.960 --> 2:57:52.400
 You literally have photographs showing people doing that.

2:57:52.400 --> 2:57:56.500
 Because a margin call comes in, you've got to liquidate everything.

2:57:56.500 --> 2:58:02.180
 So he said the danger of a debt deflation is what we have to avoid.

2:58:02.180 --> 2:58:08.360
 And that means you don't want too much private debt to accumulate, and you don't want falling

2:58:08.360 --> 2:58:14.680
 prices because the falling prices will amplify the impact of being insolvent to begin with.

2:58:14.680 --> 2:58:16.800
 And that's what we saw in the Great Depression.

2:58:16.800 --> 2:58:19.720
 It's partially what we saw in 2007.

2:58:19.720 --> 2:58:23.360
 But we didn't have anything like the level of margin debt.

2:58:23.360 --> 2:58:29.100
 Margin debt was reduced from 90% to 50% ratio after the Great Depression.

2:58:29.100 --> 2:58:33.200
 So there were limits on how bad it was in 2007.

2:58:33.200 --> 2:58:37.960
 But the danger is still the period of deflation amplifies your debts.

2:58:37.960 --> 2:58:38.960
 Okay.

2:58:38.960 --> 2:58:42.260
 And I call it Fisher's Paradox, he didn't write those terms himself.

2:58:42.260 --> 2:58:46.080
 But he wrote a line saying the more debtors pay, the more they owe.

2:58:46.080 --> 2:58:47.080
 Okay.

2:58:47.080 --> 2:58:52.360
 And this is because you're liquidating to try to meet your own debts.

2:58:52.360 --> 2:58:55.080
 When you liquidate, the price level falls.

2:58:55.080 --> 2:59:00.280
 You will end up having a lower level of monetary debt, but a higher level of debt when you

2:59:00.280 --> 2:59:02.360
 deflate it using the price level.

2:59:02.360 --> 2:59:08.000
 So the biggest danger in capitalism is the debt deflation, far more dangerous than inflation.

2:59:08.000 --> 2:59:11.040
 And the cause of debt deflation is?

2:59:11.040 --> 2:59:12.040
 Too much lending.

2:59:12.040 --> 2:59:13.040
 Too much bank lending.

2:59:13.040 --> 2:59:14.520
 Too much private money creation.

2:59:14.520 --> 2:59:21.200
 And if you take a look at the 1920s, Calvin Coolidge explained the boom of the 1920s on

2:59:21.200 --> 2:59:22.200
 his surplus.

2:59:22.200 --> 2:59:28.040
 He said, my government running a surplus of 1% of GDP pretty much from 1922 through to

2:59:28.040 --> 2:59:30.600
 1930 is the foundation of our stability.

2:59:30.600 --> 2:59:32.040
 It should be continued.

2:59:32.040 --> 2:59:37.440
 What he didn't look at was that over that same time period, on average, Americans were

2:59:37.440 --> 2:59:42.320
 borrowing 5% of GDP per year from the private banks.

2:59:42.320 --> 2:59:46.480
 So you had a housing bubble at the beginning of the 1920s, which Richard Vague covers beautifully

2:59:46.480 --> 2:59:49.720
 in the brief history of doom.

2:59:49.720 --> 2:59:54.480
 And then you had this huge rise in margin debt as well, gigantic increase in margin

2:59:54.480 --> 2:59:55.640
 debt.

2:59:55.640 --> 2:59:59.280
 So all this borrowed money was being spent into the economy, and this is where credit

2:59:59.280 --> 3:00:01.020
 becomes part of aggregate demand.

3:00:01.020 --> 3:00:05.760
 And it's both not just for goods and services, it's also for shares and houses and so on.

3:00:05.760 --> 3:00:07.960
 So a huge valuation effect.

3:00:07.960 --> 3:00:13.280
 But then when the margin debt turned around, when people would not take out margin debt

3:00:13.280 --> 3:00:16.160
 anymore, the demand for margin debt disappeared.

3:00:16.160 --> 3:00:21.940
 And then it was, you know, what we call badly a positive feedback loop is actually an amplifying

3:00:21.940 --> 3:00:22.940
 feedback loop.

3:00:22.940 --> 3:00:25.200
 And that caused a collapse.

3:00:25.200 --> 3:00:30.260
 So what elements of that do you see today that we need to fix and how do we fix it?

3:00:30.260 --> 3:00:35.500
 We have to regard the level of private debt as a target of economic policy, just as much

3:00:35.500 --> 3:00:38.760
 as the rate of inflation or the rate of unemployment.

3:00:38.760 --> 3:00:41.400
 What is the moderate amount of private debt that's good?

3:00:41.400 --> 3:00:45.320
 I would say something of anywhere between 30 and 70% of GDP.

3:00:45.320 --> 3:00:47.320
 What is it currently?

3:00:47.320 --> 3:00:50.240
 In America, it's 170%.

3:00:50.240 --> 3:00:51.720
 Nice.

3:00:51.720 --> 3:00:52.720
 Of GDP.

3:00:52.720 --> 3:00:53.720
 Of GDP.

3:00:53.720 --> 3:00:54.720
 Oh, that's nice.

3:00:54.720 --> 3:00:57.700
 I've got, we'll have to talk after we talk, but I can show you the data in this.

3:00:57.700 --> 3:01:04.560
 And it is just this huge increase in private debt that first of all caused the boom, but

3:01:04.560 --> 3:01:10.080
 then financing the credit causes, ultimately causes the slump.

3:01:10.080 --> 3:01:16.360
 And so if we remove the rate level at which debt can reach and we stop speculative lending

3:01:16.360 --> 3:01:23.400
 and basically have a lending for both innovation, investment and essential consumption items,

3:01:23.400 --> 3:01:25.800
 we won't have the slump on the other side.

3:01:25.800 --> 3:01:27.500
 We can get rid of financial instability.

3:01:27.500 --> 3:01:31.620
 We can't stop financial cycles, but we can stop financial breakdown.

3:01:31.620 --> 3:01:35.380
 So we should really be focusing on the instability and getting that under control.

3:01:35.380 --> 3:01:40.960
 By the way, as you point to your laptop, my laptops, I have a lot of, how many computers

3:01:40.960 --> 3:01:41.960
 do I have?

3:01:41.960 --> 3:01:45.920
 I have a lot of them, but my little Surface, whatever the heck this thing is, is getting

3:01:45.920 --> 3:01:50.240
 definite size envy because your laptop, you said is 18 something inches.

3:01:50.240 --> 3:01:51.240
 18.4 inches.

3:01:51.240 --> 3:01:52.240
 18.4 inches.

3:01:52.240 --> 3:01:59.560
 I don't think I've ever seen one that big and I'll give the internet that one.

3:01:59.560 --> 3:02:00.780
 All right.

3:02:00.780 --> 3:02:01.780
 That's for the graphics.

3:02:01.780 --> 3:02:02.780
 So it's a gaming laptop.

3:02:02.780 --> 3:02:03.780
 It's a gaming laptop.

3:02:03.780 --> 3:02:04.780
 It's basically a desktop.

3:02:04.780 --> 3:02:08.160
 It probably weighs like 40 pounds and you have to.

3:02:08.160 --> 3:02:09.160
 Eight kilos?

3:02:09.160 --> 3:02:10.160
 Eight kilos.

3:02:10.160 --> 3:02:11.160
 Let's see.

3:02:11.160 --> 3:02:12.160
 You reckon eight or?

3:02:12.160 --> 3:02:13.160
 Oh wow.

3:02:13.160 --> 3:02:14.160
 Okay.

3:02:14.160 --> 3:02:15.160
 Yeah.

3:02:15.160 --> 3:02:16.160
 Okay.

3:02:16.160 --> 3:02:17.160
 Eight kilos.

3:02:17.160 --> 3:02:18.160
 That's, you know, you're pushing 40 pounds.

3:02:18.160 --> 3:02:19.160
 You've seen the power supply for it?

3:02:19.160 --> 3:02:20.160
 It's over there somewhere.

3:02:20.160 --> 3:02:21.160
 The power supply weighs about twice as much as your laptop.

3:02:21.160 --> 3:02:22.160
 Yeah.

3:02:22.160 --> 3:02:23.800
 And you have to power it on with a crank.

3:02:23.800 --> 3:02:24.800
 Pretty close.

3:02:24.800 --> 3:02:25.800
 You have to like pull it.

3:02:25.800 --> 3:02:26.800
 Is it gas powered or is it coal?

3:02:26.800 --> 3:02:29.800
 Oh, well, I feel like it's a nuclear power station.

3:02:29.800 --> 3:02:30.800
 Nuclear.

3:02:30.800 --> 3:02:31.800
 Yeah.

3:02:31.800 --> 3:02:32.800
 A nuclear diamond in the back there.

3:02:32.800 --> 3:02:33.800
 Okay.

3:02:33.800 --> 3:02:41.440
 So let me, before I forget, just let me ask you about, we've covered brilliantly the

3:02:41.440 --> 3:02:46.240
 nuanced disagreements you have and the wisdom you've drawn from Karl Marx.

3:02:46.240 --> 3:02:54.920
 But there's also, like you mentioned in popular discourse, a kind of a distorted use of different

3:02:54.920 --> 3:02:58.000
 terms and one of them is Marxism today.

3:02:58.000 --> 3:03:05.620
 Is there something you could just speak to about, you know, increased use of that word

3:03:05.620 --> 3:03:06.620
 and is it misused?

3:03:06.620 --> 3:03:10.640
 Does it concern you that there's a lot of actually young people that say they're sort

3:03:10.640 --> 3:03:12.640
 of proudly Marxist?

3:03:12.640 --> 3:03:13.640
 Yeah.

3:03:13.640 --> 3:03:15.520
 Are they misusing the term?

3:03:15.520 --> 3:03:20.240
 They are definitely misusing the term if they don't understand the use value exchange

3:03:20.240 --> 3:03:23.640
 value dialectic I went through earlier.

3:03:23.640 --> 3:03:24.640
 So if I could.

3:03:24.640 --> 3:03:25.640
 And they don't.

3:03:25.640 --> 3:03:33.160
 If I could just pause, the idea of socialism and Marxism is used in sort of popular lingo.

3:03:33.160 --> 3:03:40.880
 It's basically, you know, a lot of people have a disproportionately hard life.

3:03:40.880 --> 3:03:43.840
 Why can't we help them out?

3:03:43.840 --> 3:03:46.560
 Why can't we be kind to our fellow man?

3:03:46.560 --> 3:03:54.880
 Kind of that's a short embodiment of an idea as opposed to some super complicated elaborate

3:03:54.880 --> 3:03:58.120
 model of the economy and politics and all that kind of stuff.

3:03:58.120 --> 3:03:59.120
 Yeah.

3:03:59.120 --> 3:04:02.880
 I mean, we could do that by using the insights that come out of modern monetary theory, which

3:04:02.880 --> 3:04:06.200
 I've confirmed just using my simple Minsky models.

3:04:06.200 --> 3:04:10.120
 And that is that, to use the term, usually a feature, not a bug.

3:04:10.120 --> 3:04:16.680
 A government running a deficit is a feature of a well functioning mixed fiat credit economy,

3:04:16.680 --> 3:04:17.680
 not a bug.

3:04:17.680 --> 3:04:21.000
 The government should normally run a deficit because that's how the government creates

3:04:21.000 --> 3:04:22.000
 money.

3:04:22.000 --> 3:04:26.360
 We've also had this obsession from mainstream economists of running a surplus, which is

3:04:26.360 --> 3:04:30.840
 what caused the Great Depression, Calvin Coolidge doing it for eight years.

3:04:30.840 --> 3:04:34.760
 Because of that obsession, we've cut back on social services, we've cut back on health,

3:04:34.760 --> 3:04:37.720
 we've cut back on education, we've cut back on infrastructure.

3:04:37.720 --> 3:04:42.120
 Now all that stuff predominantly affects the poor because the rich can afford to buy it

3:04:42.120 --> 3:04:43.120
 themselves.

3:04:43.120 --> 3:04:47.520
 So if we had, Sonovich, realized that the government should run a deficit, it's a feature,

3:04:47.520 --> 3:04:50.520
 not a bug of a fiat money system.

3:04:50.520 --> 3:04:55.480
 And that's where Elon's made one mistake recently, I'm not going back to funded first principles.

3:04:55.480 --> 3:05:01.760
 That deficit enables you to provide enough of a decent standard of living for those who

3:05:01.760 --> 3:05:05.800
 don't come out on top in the capitalist game.

3:05:05.800 --> 3:05:08.720
 And with that, you wouldn't have the angst of the young people.

3:05:08.720 --> 3:05:15.200
 Now we still have the climate parameters within which we have to survive, but a decent level

3:05:15.200 --> 3:05:18.560
 of government funding would mean the angst that you get where people say, I want to be

3:05:18.560 --> 3:05:23.720
 a Marxist, and they've got what I call a cardboard cutout version of Marx in their minds.

3:05:23.720 --> 3:05:25.500
 That wouldn't be happening.

3:05:25.500 --> 3:05:32.400
 So it's potential to have a good society where the government runs a deficit that finances

3:05:32.400 --> 3:05:38.760
 the needs of the poor, where the rich get enough to indulge and take care of themselves,

3:05:38.760 --> 3:05:41.080
 and you don't get this breakdown.

3:05:41.080 --> 3:05:44.760
 If you try to cause the government running a surplus, then the burden of that is borne

3:05:44.760 --> 3:05:50.240
 by the poor, middle class and poor, and that will lead to the angst we're now seeing.

3:05:50.240 --> 3:05:51.240
 LW.

3:05:51.240 --> 3:05:52.240
 Beautiful.

3:05:52.240 --> 3:05:59.480
 That was a beautiful whirlwind exploration of all of economics and economics history.

3:05:59.480 --> 3:06:05.880
 Let me ask you, you tweeted, I think, we are the opposite of ants.

3:06:05.880 --> 3:06:09.580
 Individually intelligent, collectively stupid.

3:06:09.580 --> 3:06:17.240
 You need to develop systems thinking fast to counter our limitations.

3:06:17.240 --> 3:06:19.000
 That's really interesting.

3:06:19.000 --> 3:06:21.760
 Do you really believe we're individually intelligent and collectively stupid?

3:06:21.760 --> 3:06:22.760
 RG.

3:06:22.760 --> 3:06:23.760
 I do.

3:06:23.760 --> 3:06:24.760
 LW.

3:06:24.760 --> 3:06:25.760
 Can you elaborate?

3:06:25.760 --> 3:06:27.960
 I mean, some of that is just cheeky tweets, but...

3:06:27.960 --> 3:06:28.960
 RG.

3:06:28.960 --> 3:06:31.360
 It's a cheeky tweet I've had in my mind for a long time.

3:06:31.360 --> 3:06:36.000
 It's one that actually went moderately viral, not enough, but moderately viral for me.

3:06:36.000 --> 3:06:37.000
 LW.

3:06:37.000 --> 3:06:40.760
 Nevertheless, if you could analyze it as if it's some deep, profound statement you made

3:06:40.760 --> 3:06:41.760
 in a book.

3:06:41.760 --> 3:06:42.760
 RG.

3:06:42.760 --> 3:06:46.040
 Well, the reason is that we are the incredibly individually intelligent, things like these

3:06:46.040 --> 3:06:47.480
 devices we're playing with now.

3:06:47.480 --> 3:06:48.480
 LW.

3:06:48.480 --> 3:06:49.480
 That's the creation of individual minds.

3:06:49.480 --> 3:06:50.480
 RG.

3:06:50.480 --> 3:06:53.240
 Creative individual mind and a collective labor over centuries that led to this level

3:06:53.240 --> 3:06:55.900
 of technology, and that has to be respected.

3:06:55.900 --> 3:06:58.280
 It's incredible stuff.

3:06:58.280 --> 3:07:02.720
 But at the same time, I think what humans are, if you want to distinguish humans from

3:07:02.720 --> 3:07:08.560
 other species on the planet, we don't weave webs, okay, we don't make bird calls.

3:07:08.560 --> 3:07:10.120
 What we do is we share beliefs.

3:07:10.120 --> 3:07:11.120
 LW.

3:07:11.120 --> 3:07:12.120
 Yeah.

3:07:12.120 --> 3:07:13.120
 RG.

3:07:13.120 --> 3:07:14.120
 Okay.

3:07:14.120 --> 3:07:15.120
 Now...

3:07:15.120 --> 3:07:16.120
 LW.

3:07:16.120 --> 3:07:17.120
 You don't think that's a catalyst for intelligence?

3:07:17.120 --> 3:07:18.120
 RG.

3:07:18.120 --> 3:07:19.120
 Yeah, it is a catalyst.

3:07:19.120 --> 3:07:23.000
 But what it means is we can delude ourselves as much as we can inform ourselves.

3:07:23.000 --> 3:07:27.200
 So because we share beliefs, we can do things in a collective way.

3:07:27.200 --> 3:07:33.120
 And if we believe that if we take the incantations of the witch doctors and we happen to have

3:07:33.120 --> 3:07:40.400
 a couple of spears and things, we can go and attack the local herd, a tribe of lions and

3:07:40.400 --> 3:07:43.480
 drive them out, and we become the dominant species.

3:07:43.480 --> 3:07:48.880
 So it works at the stage where we were in competition with other species on the planet.

3:07:48.880 --> 3:07:53.280
 Now that we're the dominant species, then our beliefs get in the way.

3:07:53.280 --> 3:08:00.480
 LW. So you agree with Einstein, who said there are only two things that are infinite, the

3:08:00.480 --> 3:08:01.480
 universe and human stupidity.

3:08:01.480 --> 3:08:02.480
 RG.

3:08:02.480 --> 3:08:03.480
 And he wasn't sure about the universe.

3:08:03.480 --> 3:08:04.480
 LW.

3:08:04.480 --> 3:08:05.480
 And he wasn't sure about the universe.

3:08:05.480 --> 3:08:06.480
 Right.

3:08:06.480 --> 3:08:07.480
 That's right.

3:08:07.480 --> 3:08:08.480
 And he wasn't sure about the universe.

3:08:08.480 --> 3:08:14.720
 Yeah, so you think that the collective, I mean, there's an infinity to the destructive

3:08:14.720 --> 3:08:20.000
 and the stupid, the inhumane that's possible when we humans get together, but it feels

3:08:20.000 --> 3:08:24.480
 like there's more trajectories, there's more possibility for creation.

3:08:24.480 --> 3:08:25.480
 RG.

3:08:25.480 --> 3:08:26.480
 There are.

3:08:26.480 --> 3:08:30.360
 I mean, I think that's why we have to, I say if we were built around the idea that our

3:08:30.360 --> 3:08:37.480
 role as a species is to maintain and extend life on the planet and if not find it elsewhere,

3:08:37.480 --> 3:08:43.400
 then seed it elsewhere, then that is a vision which makes us creative and confines the worst

3:08:43.400 --> 3:08:46.720
 elements of our capacities to share beliefs.

3:08:46.720 --> 3:08:51.920
 So that's what I, my hope is that we'll reach that stage, but I think we've overshot it

3:08:51.920 --> 3:08:58.520
 so badly that my real fear is we'll end up blaming technology for the type of world we

3:08:58.520 --> 3:09:01.160
 find ourselves living in in the next 20 to 50 years.

3:09:01.160 --> 3:09:02.160
 LW.

3:09:02.160 --> 3:09:05.160
 So you think technology is going to be one of the, part of the solution?

3:09:05.160 --> 3:09:06.160
 RG.

3:09:06.160 --> 3:09:07.160
 Part of the solution.

3:09:07.160 --> 3:09:08.160
 Yeah.

3:09:08.160 --> 3:09:12.360
 But if we go through and blame it, which is quite possible, we'll blame the technology

3:09:12.360 --> 3:09:16.200
 rather than blaming too much of the technology and the too much comes down to what economists

3:09:16.200 --> 3:09:21.120
 have told us, that we can just continue consuming infinitely on a finite planet.

3:09:21.120 --> 3:09:23.680
 And Kenneth Boulding said that beautifully.

3:09:23.680 --> 3:09:27.840
 If somebody believes that you can have exponential growth on a finite planet, they're either

3:09:27.840 --> 3:09:29.800
 mad or they're an economist.

3:09:29.800 --> 3:09:30.800
 LW.

3:09:30.800 --> 3:09:39.440
 So you're, you made a long journey for which I'm deeply honoured from, from, this distant

3:09:39.440 --> 3:09:40.440
 place.

3:09:40.440 --> 3:09:41.440
 RG.

3:09:41.440 --> 3:09:42.440
 Antibodies.

3:09:42.440 --> 3:09:43.440
 There's myth.

3:09:43.440 --> 3:09:44.440
 RG.

3:09:44.440 --> 3:09:45.440
 You've got to go there one day, you'd enjoy it.

3:09:45.440 --> 3:09:47.400
 If I go there, I will stay forever.

3:09:47.400 --> 3:09:48.400
 And so...

3:09:48.400 --> 3:09:49.400
 LW.

3:09:49.400 --> 3:09:51.600
 No, it's a bit too, there's more vitality back in this economy.

3:09:51.600 --> 3:09:52.600
 So you'd come back.

3:09:52.600 --> 3:09:53.600
 RG.

3:09:53.600 --> 3:09:54.600
 Okay.

3:09:54.600 --> 3:09:55.600
 Maybe.

3:09:55.600 --> 3:09:58.800
 You know, I'm not a fan of the economy or money or any of that.

3:09:58.800 --> 3:10:02.240
 Nature calls me.

3:10:02.240 --> 3:10:04.840
 Let me, so I'm honoured that you make that trip.

3:10:04.840 --> 3:10:11.300
 You've also said that while you're here in Austin, you're going to go to this American

3:10:11.300 --> 3:10:18.160
 factory that makes cars here in Austin and also visit Starbase.

3:10:18.160 --> 3:10:22.320
 So let me ask you about expanding out into the universe.

3:10:22.320 --> 3:10:25.280
 Is that something that excites you?

3:10:25.280 --> 3:10:30.940
 You mentioned about the economics of it, do you think, what do you think Marx would think

3:10:30.940 --> 3:10:31.940
 about this?

3:10:31.940 --> 3:10:35.400
 Like what, economically speaking, what is this?

3:10:35.400 --> 3:10:36.400
 Is it a good thing?

3:10:36.400 --> 3:10:37.400
 LW.

3:10:37.400 --> 3:10:38.400
 I think it's vital.

3:10:38.400 --> 3:10:42.400
 I mean, we can have capitalism in outer space far more successfully than we can have it

3:10:42.400 --> 3:10:46.480
 on the planet because we don't face, when we dump the waste, it ends up in the sun.

3:10:46.480 --> 3:10:49.000
 Not a problem, okay?

3:10:49.000 --> 3:10:54.620
 So it means the potential, we don't undermine our own productive capacity if we're doing

3:10:54.620 --> 3:10:55.620
 it in outer space.

3:10:55.620 --> 3:10:56.620
 RG.

3:10:56.620 --> 3:10:59.600
 So the destructive element of waste has a lesser impact in outer space.

3:10:59.600 --> 3:11:00.600
 LW.

3:11:00.600 --> 3:11:01.600
 Far lesser, yeah.

3:11:01.600 --> 3:11:03.600
 I mean, who cares if we throw a bit of our iron back into the sun again?

3:11:03.600 --> 3:11:07.120
 It'd take a fair bit of it to turn it into what would be the next stage, it'd be a red

3:11:07.120 --> 3:11:08.800
 giant.

3:11:08.800 --> 3:11:12.500
 And we have to get away because if there's a red giant at some stage, the sun will head

3:11:12.500 --> 3:11:16.840
 out past the orbit of Mars, I think, certainly past the orbit of Earth.

3:11:16.840 --> 3:11:25.760
 So to have longevity of just human life, life that evolved on this planet, we have to be

3:11:25.760 --> 3:11:28.240
 able to take it off planet, ultimately.

3:11:28.240 --> 3:11:33.160
 So if you think in the really long term, then it's our responsibility, we're going to want

3:11:33.160 --> 3:11:37.360
 to maintain life, is to establish life off the planet.

3:11:37.360 --> 3:11:38.360
 LW.

3:11:38.360 --> 3:11:43.800
 What do you think about robots and AI as part of the expanding out into the universe?

3:11:43.800 --> 3:11:44.800
 RG.

3:11:44.800 --> 3:11:45.800
 Oh yeah, we have to.

3:11:45.800 --> 3:11:46.800
 I mean, that ends labor.

3:11:46.800 --> 3:11:51.440
 You can't go for a, you know, your daily joint can't be from here to the asteroid belt and

3:11:51.440 --> 3:11:54.260
 back again for dinner with your family.

3:11:54.260 --> 3:11:56.480
 So production would be entirely mechanized.

3:11:56.480 --> 3:11:59.640
 There'd have to be a handful of people who service the machines.

3:11:59.640 --> 3:12:00.640
 LW.

3:12:00.640 --> 3:12:02.320
 So it's about production and automation.

3:12:02.320 --> 3:12:08.840
 What about elements of consciousness that make humans so special, what about that persisting

3:12:08.840 --> 3:12:09.840
 within the machine?

3:12:09.840 --> 3:12:10.840
 RG.

3:12:10.840 --> 3:12:13.280
 That, I mean, I'm still a skeptic about us ever being able to create a machine which

3:12:13.280 --> 3:12:14.900
 is truly conscious.

3:12:14.900 --> 3:12:16.760
 If I can throw my, it's only two cents worth.

3:12:16.760 --> 3:12:17.760
 LW.

3:12:17.760 --> 3:12:21.040
 That would really piss off Karl Marx, by the way, if we create machines that are conscious.

3:12:21.040 --> 3:12:22.040
 RG.

3:12:22.040 --> 3:12:23.040
 Exactly.

3:12:23.040 --> 3:12:25.200
 This is actually part of the, there's two good logical arguments against the labor theory

3:12:25.200 --> 3:12:26.200
 of value.

3:12:26.200 --> 3:12:30.200
 One of what it becomes, machines become intelligent, and the other was that if the declining rate

3:12:30.200 --> 3:12:36.000
 of profit applies in socialism, it'll apply as a rate of accumulation, sorry, in capitalism,

3:12:36.000 --> 3:12:38.000
 it'll apply as a rate of socialism as well.

3:12:38.000 --> 3:12:39.880
 A guy called Khalid made that argument.

3:12:39.880 --> 3:12:42.500
 So his argument was just unsound.

3:12:42.500 --> 3:12:45.720
 But yeah, intelligent machines would completely screw Marx up, you know?

3:12:45.720 --> 3:12:46.720
 LW.

3:12:46.720 --> 3:12:47.720
 Yeah.

3:12:47.720 --> 3:12:52.720
 Do you not like that world where machines have not only intelligence, but a consciousness,

3:12:52.720 --> 3:12:53.720
 a soul?

3:12:53.720 --> 3:12:54.720
 RG.

3:12:54.720 --> 3:12:55.720
 Yeah.

3:12:55.720 --> 3:13:01.800
 I know that's one of your interests, one of your potential endeavors, and the Kurtz will

3:13:01.800 --> 3:13:05.720
 argue that there's some singularity we're approaching as we just get increasing processing

3:13:05.720 --> 3:13:06.720
 power.

3:13:06.720 --> 3:13:09.520
 It's not processing power, it's imagination.

3:13:09.520 --> 3:13:10.520
 And I think—

3:13:10.520 --> 3:13:11.520
 LW.

3:13:11.520 --> 3:13:12.520
 Whatever the heck that means.

3:13:12.520 --> 3:13:13.520
 RG.

3:13:13.520 --> 3:13:14.520
 Huh?

3:13:14.520 --> 3:13:15.520
 Whatever the heck that means, yeah.

3:13:15.520 --> 3:13:16.520
 I mean, you would have had imaginative insights.

3:13:16.520 --> 3:13:23.680
 I mean, your papers on, like, in automating motoring between the hyperintelligent machine

3:13:23.680 --> 3:13:28.360
 or the machine human interface where the standards can be lower for the machine and higher for

3:13:28.360 --> 3:13:29.360
 the human, okay?

3:13:29.360 --> 3:13:33.120
 That's an insight you would have had at some point, and then you've worked it further.

3:13:33.120 --> 3:13:36.400
 So I've had insights like that as well, and I have no idea where they come from.

3:13:36.400 --> 3:13:41.080
 They just hit me in the head, and I just write them down, and they solve a problem that I

3:13:41.080 --> 3:13:43.680
 didn't even know my mind was working on, okay?

3:13:43.680 --> 3:13:47.000
 So how can we get a machine to do that?

3:13:47.000 --> 3:13:53.440
 And I do not know the answer, but one thing I think is the potential is I think we have

3:13:53.440 --> 3:13:58.500
 to create AI that has feelings, AI that wants to survive.

3:13:58.500 --> 3:14:04.000
 Because if you think how our intelligence evolved, it's on this planet in a struggle

3:14:04.000 --> 3:14:07.640
 between predator and prey, and intelligent became a survival technique.

3:14:07.640 --> 3:14:08.640
 LW.

3:14:08.640 --> 3:14:15.640
 I find the ideas of Ernest Becker with denial of death really powerful, which is that humans

3:14:15.640 --> 3:14:26.080
 not only have emotions and are trying to survive, they're able to ponder out in the distant

3:14:26.080 --> 3:14:32.960
 future their mortality, and that is a driving force for even greater creation that animals

3:14:32.960 --> 3:14:38.880
 are able to do, more primitive animals.

3:14:38.880 --> 3:14:42.280
 So there is some element where I agree with you.

3:14:42.280 --> 3:14:49.240
 I think for AI systems to have something like consciousness, they have to fear their mortality.

3:14:49.240 --> 3:14:50.240
 LW.

3:14:50.240 --> 3:14:51.240
 Exactly.

3:14:51.240 --> 3:14:57.160
 And I think that's, if you do it then, you can't produce an AI whose behavior you can

3:14:57.160 --> 3:14:58.160
 control.

3:14:58.160 --> 3:14:59.160
 RL.

3:14:59.160 --> 3:15:00.160
 I mean, when you have kids.

3:15:00.160 --> 3:15:01.160
 LW.

3:15:01.160 --> 3:15:02.160
 Yeah.

3:15:02.160 --> 3:15:03.160
 You're doing it.

3:15:03.160 --> 3:15:04.160
 RL.

3:15:04.160 --> 3:15:05.160
 You can't control their behavior.

3:15:05.160 --> 3:15:06.160
 That's the tradeoff.

3:15:06.160 --> 3:15:07.160
 LW.

3:15:07.160 --> 3:15:08.160
 You give life to an anarchist.

3:15:08.160 --> 3:15:14.120
 Like one of my favorite instances in my family life is one of my favorite, I like all my

3:15:14.120 --> 3:15:19.840
 nurses and nephews, but one's got a real quirk to her, and I was standing over her cot when

3:15:19.840 --> 3:15:24.680
 she was literally like about six months old, and she was gurgling away to herself.

3:15:24.680 --> 3:15:28.920
 And her father waved his fingers and said, stop making that noise.

3:15:28.920 --> 3:15:33.960
 And this little six month old kid goes, and I said, boy, you're going to have issues with

3:15:33.960 --> 3:15:34.960
 that one, mate.

3:15:34.960 --> 3:15:35.960
 RL.

3:15:35.960 --> 3:15:36.960
 Yeah.

3:15:36.960 --> 3:15:37.960
 An anarchist was born.

3:15:37.960 --> 3:15:38.960
 LW.

3:15:38.960 --> 3:15:41.760
 So you can't control this life you give birth to, and that's, I think, the threat of AI.

3:15:41.760 --> 3:15:42.760
 RL.

3:15:42.760 --> 3:15:43.760
 That's terrifying and exciting.

3:15:43.760 --> 3:15:44.760
 LW.

3:15:44.760 --> 3:15:45.760
 It is.

3:15:45.760 --> 3:15:47.520
 And I think we should take that risk at some stage.

3:15:47.520 --> 3:15:53.600
 But I think to do it with what actually let artificial intelligence involve in this environment

3:15:53.600 --> 3:15:55.800
 in which it fears its own death.

3:15:55.800 --> 3:15:56.800
 RL.

3:15:56.800 --> 3:15:57.800
 Yeah.

3:15:57.800 --> 3:15:58.800
 Yeah.

3:15:58.800 --> 3:16:04.160
 I think there's a lot of beauty there, but there's also a lot of destruction that's possible.

3:16:04.160 --> 3:16:09.200
 So you have to be extremely careful, but that's kind of the cutting edge of which we all often

3:16:09.200 --> 3:16:12.080
 operate as a humanity.

3:16:12.080 --> 3:16:13.680
 Let me ask you for advice.

3:16:13.680 --> 3:16:19.720
 Can you give advice to young people in high school and college?

3:16:19.720 --> 3:16:22.400
 Maybe they're interested in economics.

3:16:22.400 --> 3:16:25.080
 Maybe they have other career ideas.

3:16:25.080 --> 3:16:29.520
 What advice would you give them about a career they can have that they can be proud of or

3:16:29.520 --> 3:16:31.040
 a life they can be proud of?

3:16:31.040 --> 3:16:34.320
 LW. Mainly in a career, I say don't do an economics degree.

3:16:34.320 --> 3:16:35.320
 Okay?

3:16:35.320 --> 3:16:36.320
 I say if you...

3:16:36.320 --> 3:16:37.320
 RL.

3:16:37.320 --> 3:16:38.320
 There's a little book.

3:16:38.320 --> 3:16:39.320
 LW.

3:16:39.320 --> 3:16:40.320
 Econ Comics.

3:16:40.320 --> 3:16:41.320
 RL.

3:16:41.320 --> 3:16:45.880
 Econ Comics, Taking the Con Out of Economics.

3:16:45.880 --> 3:16:50.520
 So they should start with that and then say screw it to an economics degree.

3:16:50.520 --> 3:16:51.520
 LW.

3:16:51.520 --> 3:16:54.540
 Yeah, because what you learn is an obsolete technology.

3:16:54.540 --> 3:16:58.360
 Learning economics at a university is like learning to make astronomy.

3:16:58.360 --> 3:16:59.360
 Okay?

3:16:59.360 --> 3:17:06.600
 Earth centric, equilibrium, you know, epicycles being added to make your models fit the data.

3:17:06.600 --> 3:17:07.600
 RL.

3:17:07.600 --> 3:17:11.960
 So it's not that economics is not a discipline worth deeply studying, it's that the university

3:17:11.960 --> 3:17:13.680
 education around economics is bad.

3:17:13.680 --> 3:17:14.680
 LW.

3:17:14.680 --> 3:17:15.680
 Is so bad.

3:17:15.680 --> 3:17:16.680
 Yeah.

3:17:16.680 --> 3:17:17.680
 So I'd say learn system dynamics.

3:17:17.680 --> 3:17:21.920
 Do a course in system dynamics which you can apply in any field and then apply what you

3:17:21.920 --> 3:17:26.160
 learn out of system dynamics to the issues of economics if that's what interests you.

3:17:26.160 --> 3:17:27.160
 RL.

3:17:27.160 --> 3:17:29.320
 So get a sort of base engineering...

3:17:29.320 --> 3:17:30.320
 LW.

3:17:30.320 --> 3:17:31.320
 Yeah.

3:17:31.320 --> 3:17:32.320
...education.

3:17:32.320 --> 3:17:33.320
 RL.

3:17:33.320 --> 3:17:34.320
 A base engineering education.

3:17:34.320 --> 3:17:35.320
 That is far better than doing an economics degree.

3:17:35.320 --> 3:17:40.160
 In terms of life, my life is pretty chaotic in many, many ways.

3:17:40.160 --> 3:17:44.400
 My friends and family will tell me that at every opportunity.

3:17:44.400 --> 3:17:48.720
 But the thing is, I once had a, I'll tell you an example of a really funny incident

3:17:48.720 --> 3:17:51.920
 that occurred to me because I led this student revolt at Sydney University as I mentioned

3:17:51.920 --> 3:17:52.920
 when I was 20 years old.

3:17:52.920 --> 3:17:53.920
 LW.

3:17:53.920 --> 3:17:54.920
 Yeah.

3:17:54.920 --> 3:17:55.920
 This is great.

3:17:55.920 --> 3:17:56.920
 RL.

3:17:56.920 --> 3:18:01.420
 So I was at a restaurant one night and I found a bunch of guys, all guys, who'd done accounting

3:18:01.420 --> 3:18:04.780
 at the university but had also been part of the student revolt.

3:18:04.780 --> 3:18:07.920
 So they hadn't seen me for about a decade and they said, what have you been doing, Steve?

3:18:07.920 --> 3:18:09.040
 And I talked about what I'd done.

3:18:09.040 --> 3:18:10.760
 So I'd been a school teacher for a while.

3:18:10.760 --> 3:18:13.320
 I then worked in overseas aid.

3:18:13.320 --> 3:18:17.840
 I was doing computer programming at the time and had forgotten what else I was doing at

3:18:17.840 --> 3:18:18.840
 that point.

3:18:18.840 --> 3:18:21.100
 So I explained it to all of them and they were at a Bucks night, one of them having

3:18:21.100 --> 3:18:23.520
 a wedding coming up the next week.

3:18:23.520 --> 3:18:27.080
 And one of them said, I wish I'd done that.

3:18:27.080 --> 3:18:31.400
 And there was silence around the table, it was obviously a silent agreement.

3:18:31.400 --> 3:18:35.720
 And I looked at them and said, hang on, guys, look at the downside of my life.

3:18:35.720 --> 3:18:41.840
 You know, like you're getting married, I don't have a girlfriend right now, you've all got

3:18:41.840 --> 3:18:47.700
 secure jobs, I'm unemployed, okay, you own a house, I haven't even got a car, you know,

3:18:47.700 --> 3:18:49.420
 look at the downside of my life.

3:18:49.420 --> 3:18:53.080
 And the bloke was the kingpin of that group, they're a very innovative bunch of guys in

3:18:53.080 --> 3:18:54.080
 the student revolt.

3:18:54.080 --> 3:19:01.200
 And so he said, Steve, we would still all rather have done what you have done.

3:19:01.200 --> 3:19:05.680
 And they did a county because it was safe, you always get a job, and they were bored

3:19:05.680 --> 3:19:06.680
 shitless.

3:19:06.680 --> 3:19:14.520
 Did you have a sense that the chaos you're always jumping into was dangerous or was it

3:19:14.520 --> 3:19:16.880
 just the pull of it?

3:19:16.880 --> 3:19:18.960
 I simply couldn't not do it.

3:19:18.960 --> 3:19:22.160
 It was part of me that I couldn't swallow this economic stuff.

3:19:22.160 --> 3:19:29.040
 Once I was exposed to why it was so wrong, then I was on a crusade to make it right.

3:19:29.040 --> 3:19:32.840
 And that's been part of my nature all through my life, I don't know why.

3:19:32.840 --> 3:19:37.880
 So it wasn't that I made a choice to do it, it's that I couldn't be true to myself without

3:19:37.880 --> 3:19:38.880
 doing it.

3:19:38.880 --> 3:19:42.260
 And I find a lot of people get caught in a life where they're doing it because it works

3:19:42.260 --> 3:19:46.300
 for some financial or other reason, but they're not being true to themselves.

3:19:46.300 --> 3:19:50.360
 And as messy as my life is, as much shit I've got myself caught up in, and there's a lot

3:19:50.360 --> 3:19:55.600
 of that in my personal and financial life right now, which is a pain in the ass.

3:19:55.600 --> 3:19:58.680
 I would rather have had that nature than not.

3:19:58.680 --> 3:20:02.680
 You would rather take the pain in the ass than not.

3:20:02.680 --> 3:20:06.080
 Let me ask a dark question.

3:20:06.080 --> 3:20:09.800
 What's the darkest place you've ever gone to in your mind?

3:20:09.800 --> 3:20:15.000
 So in all that rollercoaster of life, have there been periods where it's been really

3:20:15.000 --> 3:20:16.000
 tough?

3:20:16.000 --> 3:20:22.040
 I've had to cope with depression in the last five years since I started reading Neoclassical

3:20:22.040 --> 3:20:23.480
 Economists on Climate Change.

3:20:23.480 --> 3:20:24.480
 Sorry to laugh.

3:20:24.480 --> 3:20:25.480
 Got to come back to that one.

3:20:25.480 --> 3:20:28.120
 So that's where my wife's going to come into this story.

3:20:28.120 --> 3:20:34.840
 So I was reading Richard Toll, a paper from 2009 called The Economics of Climate Change,

3:20:34.840 --> 3:20:37.320
 Journal of Economic Perspectives, I think.

3:20:37.320 --> 3:20:43.320
 And I read this section where he says that one of the ways they tried to calibrate what

3:20:43.320 --> 3:20:48.440
 climate change was due is they assumed that the relationship between GDP and temperature

3:20:48.440 --> 3:20:54.000
 over space would apply over time as well.

3:20:54.000 --> 3:20:59.480
 And I read that and thought, that is so fucking stupid, because all it's saying is that if

3:20:59.480 --> 3:21:03.720
 there's a 10 degree temperature difference between New York and Florida and a 20% difference

3:21:03.720 --> 3:21:08.440
 in income, then a 10 degree increase in temperature will cause GDP to fall by 20%.

3:21:08.440 --> 3:21:10.360
 It is so insanely stupid.

3:21:10.360 --> 3:21:16.520
 So when I read that line, I just did this.

3:21:16.520 --> 3:21:18.320
 I was in shock at how stupid it was.

3:21:18.320 --> 3:21:25.220
 My wife, who's Thai and brings in treats for me all day, walks into the room and she speaks

3:21:25.220 --> 3:21:29.380
 in a staccato English and says to me, why are you like this?

3:21:29.380 --> 3:21:31.760
 And I said, I'm just doing this work on climate change.

3:21:31.760 --> 3:21:35.160
 And she interrupts me and says, oh, why you do that stuff?

3:21:35.160 --> 3:21:36.760
 Nobody's interested in climate change.

3:21:36.760 --> 3:21:38.080
 You can't do anything to change it.

3:21:38.080 --> 3:21:41.040
 If we die, we die.

3:21:41.040 --> 3:21:44.360
 And that's perfect Buddhist grounding.

3:21:44.360 --> 3:21:48.560
 And I thought, well, I can't argue with her again.

3:21:48.560 --> 3:21:53.160
 So that sort of stopped me on the depression, but that's the darkest point when I looked

3:21:53.160 --> 3:22:00.780
 at it and I thought that this arrogance, this stupidity, this humbug in the economists meant

3:22:00.780 --> 3:22:05.120
 that we were potentially jeopardizing the lives of billions of people and Christ knows

3:22:05.120 --> 3:22:08.060
 how many other life forms.

3:22:08.060 --> 3:22:13.840
 And having that knowledge is the most depressing experience of my life.

3:22:13.840 --> 3:22:23.360
 That ideas, simple models combined with arrogance can lead to the potential destruction of human

3:22:23.360 --> 3:22:24.360
 civilization.

3:22:24.360 --> 3:22:25.800
 That was a very heavy.

3:22:25.800 --> 3:22:35.560
 And then your wife came in with Nature Wins in the End and sort of accept the flow of

3:22:35.560 --> 3:22:36.560
 life.

3:22:36.560 --> 3:22:40.120
 I really enjoy that book, The Earth Abides, because it's got that same beautiful sense

3:22:40.120 --> 3:22:41.120
 to it.

3:22:41.120 --> 3:22:42.800
 Life will survive whatever we do.

3:22:42.800 --> 3:22:46.640
 I mean, they talk about the people, I was actually talking with a good mate of mine,

3:22:46.640 --> 3:22:49.640
 an ex geologist, and he's now a professor of economics.

3:22:49.640 --> 3:22:54.900
 And he said as a geologist, he really hated people talking about the Anthropocene epoch.

3:22:54.900 --> 3:23:00.820
 And I said, well, it shouldn't be the Anthropocene epoch, it'll be the Anthropocene event.

3:23:00.820 --> 3:23:06.960
 Anthropocene epoch is millions of years and a huge period of life on the planet.

3:23:06.960 --> 3:23:12.360
 And we might be snuffed out in 10,000 years of human civilization.

3:23:12.360 --> 3:23:16.760
 And that's not much slower than the meteors wiping out the dinosaurs.

3:23:16.760 --> 3:23:19.480
 The dinosaurs lasted for a long time after that event.

3:23:19.480 --> 3:23:26.840
 So we'd just be a layer in the surface of the planet with plastics and strange metals

3:23:26.840 --> 3:23:29.100
 like that at some point.

3:23:29.100 --> 3:23:30.100
 So we're just an epoch.

3:23:30.100 --> 3:23:31.100
 Life will abide.

3:23:31.100 --> 3:23:32.100
 Life will survive us.

3:23:32.100 --> 3:23:37.360
 But there's so much life we're going to take down with us in this whole period.

3:23:37.360 --> 3:23:43.000
 And there's so many of our own lives we're going to terminate for no good reason.

3:23:43.000 --> 3:23:46.160
 I'm looking at this Richard Toll character.

3:23:46.160 --> 3:23:48.120
 I'll definitely have to look at some of his papers.

3:23:48.120 --> 3:23:52.920
 It does look like, boy, is he oversimplifying and do a lot of people.

3:23:52.920 --> 3:23:53.920
 Oh my God.

3:23:53.920 --> 3:23:57.520
 Check his one on how good it'll be to lose Amok.

3:23:57.520 --> 3:24:03.200
 That said, I'm going to approach all of these topics with humility.

3:24:03.200 --> 3:24:07.120
 And I would like to have some conversations if people can recommend.

3:24:07.120 --> 3:24:12.280
 My default position is always with the scientists, but even above that, my default position is

3:24:12.280 --> 3:24:16.960
 with those who are humble versus those who are arrogant.

3:24:16.960 --> 3:24:21.760
 This idea that because you're a quote unquote expert, you deserve to have arrogance is a

3:24:21.760 --> 3:24:23.240
 silly idea to me.

3:24:23.240 --> 3:24:29.280
 Again, going to the broader view of life on earth, nature.

3:24:29.280 --> 3:24:35.360
 Nature's the only one that gets to be arrogant and it chooses not to.

3:24:35.360 --> 3:24:39.060
 So let me ask you about love.

3:24:39.060 --> 3:24:41.760
 What role does love play in this whole thing?

3:24:41.760 --> 3:24:43.760
 Did Karl Marx have a model for that?

3:24:43.760 --> 3:24:48.800
 Oh, Marx was madly in love with Jenny von Westphalen and wrote love poetry to her long

3:24:48.800 --> 3:24:51.260
 before he wrote Das Kapital.

3:24:51.260 --> 3:24:52.560
 And he was infatuated with her.

3:24:52.560 --> 3:24:57.040
 He ended up also impregnating his housekeeper.

3:24:57.040 --> 3:25:02.800
 So there's a son of Karl Marx, who was the son of the housekeeper, not the Jenny.

3:25:02.800 --> 3:25:05.640
 There are numerous daughters.

3:25:05.640 --> 3:25:09.240
 So he had a complicated view of love.

3:25:09.240 --> 3:25:10.240
 Oh yeah.

3:25:10.240 --> 3:25:12.520
 There's a dialectic on love there.

3:25:12.520 --> 3:25:19.920
 He had an idealistic view with Jenny and he was rejected because he wasn't, not by Jenny,

3:25:19.920 --> 3:25:22.000
 she was madly in love with him as well.

3:25:22.000 --> 3:25:25.400
 So it was a real passionate love affair from the very outset.

3:25:25.400 --> 3:25:28.600
 But then of course you have children, lots of them die.

3:25:28.600 --> 3:25:31.200
 There's a huge amount of tragedy in his life as well.

3:25:31.200 --> 3:25:37.200
 He and Jenny were forced out of Chelsea by a cholera epidemic.

3:25:37.200 --> 3:25:43.600
 My vision for London back in the 1850s and 60s was Calcutta in the 1970s.

3:25:43.600 --> 3:25:45.200
 That's really what life was like.

3:25:45.200 --> 3:25:48.000
 So there's a lot of hardship in his life as well.

3:25:48.000 --> 3:25:50.640
 And he was always poor.

3:25:50.640 --> 3:25:54.760
 So only Ingalls kept him alive financially.

3:25:54.760 --> 3:26:01.680
 He applied for one job outside of, he never got an academic job.

3:26:01.680 --> 3:26:07.520
 He was pushed out of Prussia as a newspaper author, but he also applied for a job as a

3:26:07.520 --> 3:26:15.360
 clerk in the British railway system, was turned down because they couldn't read his handwriting.

3:26:15.360 --> 3:26:18.760
 I think I'm a bit similar there.

3:26:18.760 --> 3:26:21.120
 So yeah, there's a lot of love and passion.

3:26:21.120 --> 3:26:24.560
 But in general, what do you think is the role of love in the human condition?

3:26:24.560 --> 3:26:25.560
 It's vital.

3:26:25.560 --> 3:26:33.520
 It's, I mean, that feeling of passionate desire and respect for somebody else.

3:26:33.520 --> 3:26:35.280
 And there's perverted forms of love as well.

3:26:35.280 --> 3:26:42.520
 So I'll leave that out, but somebody having a really, a deep bond, which goes beyond just

3:26:42.520 --> 3:26:43.520
 sexual attraction.

3:26:43.520 --> 3:26:48.480
 Like I've had that four or five times in my life with different women at different times.

3:26:48.480 --> 3:26:52.960
 And I've stuffed up the most important one very early on.

3:26:52.960 --> 3:26:56.200
 And that feeling is incredible.

3:26:56.200 --> 3:27:01.560
 And you couldn't have life worth living without that.

3:27:01.560 --> 3:27:04.040
 So it's an essential part of who we are.

3:27:04.040 --> 3:27:08.400
 But what we have to do is to transfer it, not just to the rest of our species, but to

3:27:08.400 --> 3:27:10.500
 all the species.

3:27:10.500 --> 3:27:12.920
 And that's, I think, what's vital.

3:27:12.920 --> 3:27:16.880
 And how do we maintain that over generations?

3:27:16.880 --> 3:27:22.200
 And I think that idea that we can actually hang on to that general sense of respect and

3:27:22.200 --> 3:27:23.200
 not lose it again.

3:27:23.200 --> 3:27:29.800
 Because the amount of life we've terminated on this planet, the warlike side of humanity,

3:27:29.800 --> 3:27:32.920
 that is too much of a defining feature of our species.

3:27:32.920 --> 3:27:35.160
 That's the opposite of love, it's hate.

3:27:35.160 --> 3:27:37.180
 But it's pleasure and inflicting pain on others.

3:27:37.180 --> 3:27:42.480
 When you see people killing others in a warlike environment, they're enjoying themselves.

3:27:42.480 --> 3:27:44.720
 It's rarely, sometimes it's self defense.

3:27:44.720 --> 3:27:49.720
 But there's, when I've spoken to people who've been involved in combat and been involved

3:27:49.720 --> 3:27:54.860
 in riots and said, when you see somebody rioting, bashing people up, they're enjoying themselves.

3:27:54.860 --> 3:27:56.800
 It's not anger they're feeling, it's pleasure.

3:27:56.800 --> 3:27:58.600
 There's a dark aspect to human nature.

3:27:58.600 --> 3:27:59.640
 Very dark.

3:27:59.640 --> 3:28:04.620
 But there's also the capacity to rise above that.

3:28:04.620 --> 3:28:08.840
 And I think, like I put us on a spectrum between chimpanzees at one extreme and bonobos at

3:28:08.840 --> 3:28:09.840
 the other.

3:28:09.840 --> 3:28:12.760
 We're too close to the chimpanzees.

3:28:12.760 --> 3:28:15.200
 Bonobos are just having fun, having lots of sex.

3:28:15.200 --> 3:28:18.520
 Every time they do anything, they fuck first and do the work later and then fuck afterwards

3:28:18.520 --> 3:28:19.520
 to celebrate.

3:28:19.520 --> 3:28:21.640
 Fuck first, ask questions later.

3:28:21.640 --> 3:28:27.280
 It's like that Scent of a Woman, one of my favorite films, where Al Pacino gives advice

3:28:27.280 --> 3:28:28.280
 to a cat.

3:28:28.280 --> 3:28:31.920
 He says, when in doubt, fuck.

3:28:31.920 --> 3:28:36.120
 It's good life advice for a cat, especially.

3:28:36.120 --> 3:28:42.080
 We mentioned that death seems to be maybe fundamental to creating a conscious AI.

3:28:42.080 --> 3:28:47.640
 All right, do you think about your own death?

3:28:47.640 --> 3:28:49.920
 Are you afraid of it?

3:28:49.920 --> 3:28:53.880
 I'm afraid of going through it.

3:28:53.880 --> 3:28:54.880
 Not the other side?

3:28:54.880 --> 3:28:55.880
 Huh?

3:28:55.880 --> 3:28:56.880
 You're not afraid of being on the other side?

3:28:56.880 --> 3:28:58.360
 I don't think there is an other side.

3:28:58.360 --> 3:29:00.520
 I mean, I'm agnostic.

3:29:00.520 --> 3:29:02.760
 I'm atheist when pressed and agnostic.

3:29:02.760 --> 3:29:07.400
 The one thing that I think I can understand why religion exists is that the whole thing

3:29:07.400 --> 3:29:11.260
 that something exists is itself a dilemma.

3:29:11.260 --> 3:29:16.520
 You have to take on faith that reality exists, whether it's a simulation or actual reality,

3:29:16.520 --> 3:29:20.480
 it exists, and that itself can't be explained in any scientific manner.

3:29:20.480 --> 3:29:25.400
 I mean, you can talk about anti protons and protons and the sun being zero and so on,

3:29:25.400 --> 3:29:27.700
 but why did it even happen in the first place?

3:29:27.700 --> 3:29:31.780
 So there's part you simply have to take on faith.

3:29:31.780 --> 3:29:36.600
 So there was darkness before, and there's darkness after.

3:29:36.600 --> 3:29:39.560
 Yeah, and I don't know if we're going to be alive on the other side of that darkness.

3:29:39.560 --> 3:29:45.160
 I think individually, no, but the way you can live on is by what you do to human consciousness.

3:29:45.160 --> 3:29:49.800
 How do you hope people remember you?

3:29:49.800 --> 3:29:56.880
 As someone who managed to integrate economics with an appreciation for life.

3:29:56.880 --> 3:30:05.440
 Well, I have to say, as a bit of a callback, you're one deadly bastard.

3:30:05.440 --> 3:30:09.360
 It's a huge honor that you would come down and talk to me.

3:30:09.360 --> 3:30:10.440
 You're a brilliant person.

3:30:10.440 --> 3:30:11.840
 You're a hilarious person.

3:30:11.840 --> 3:30:12.960
 The humility shines through.

3:30:12.960 --> 3:30:13.960
 The brilliance shines through.

3:30:13.960 --> 3:30:16.360
 Thank you so much for spending this time.

3:30:16.360 --> 3:30:17.360
 You do the same for humanity.

3:30:17.360 --> 3:30:21.520
 I mean, when I saw that email from you, my eyes popped out of my head.

3:30:21.520 --> 3:30:22.520
 Okay.

3:30:22.520 --> 3:30:23.520
 Well, you should hold your judgment.

3:30:23.520 --> 3:30:25.720
 I got to show you the sex dungeon I have.

3:30:25.720 --> 3:30:28.840
 I'm waiting for an invitation.

3:30:28.840 --> 3:30:30.320
 I'll send my wife over.

3:30:30.320 --> 3:30:31.320
 Awesome.

3:30:31.320 --> 3:30:32.320
 Can't wait.

3:30:32.320 --> 3:30:33.320
 All right.

3:30:33.320 --> 3:30:34.320
 Okay, mate.

3:30:34.320 --> 3:30:36.320
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Steve Keen.

3:30:36.320 --> 3:30:40.340
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

3:30:40.340 --> 3:30:44.360
 And now let me leave you with some words from Karl Marx.

3:30:44.360 --> 3:30:49.880
 To be radical is to grasp things at their root.

3:30:49.880 --> 3:31:07.000
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
