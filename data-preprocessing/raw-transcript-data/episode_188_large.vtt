00:00.000 --> 00:03.160
 The following is a conversation with Vitalik Buterin,

00:03.160 --> 00:05.220
 his second time on the podcast.

00:05.220 --> 00:07.480
 Vitalik is the cofounder of Ethereum

00:07.480 --> 00:09.600
 and one of the most influential people

00:09.600 --> 00:13.240
 in cryptocurrency and technology broadly defined.

00:13.240 --> 00:15.360
 Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:15.360 --> 00:18.320
 Athletic Greens, Magic Spoon, Indeed,

00:18.320 --> 00:20.840
 Four Sigmatic, and BetterHelp.

00:20.840 --> 00:24.280
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:24.280 --> 00:27.800
 As a side note, let me say that Ethereum, Bitcoin,

00:27.800 --> 00:29.560
 and many other cryptocurrencies

00:29.560 --> 00:33.560
 have been taking a wild ride of prices going up and down

00:33.560 --> 00:35.100
 in the past few months.

00:35.100 --> 00:38.700
 To me, the prices were never as important as the ideas,

00:38.700 --> 00:41.140
 both technical and philosophical.

00:41.140 --> 00:43.720
 Cryptocurrency has the potential to empower billions

00:43.720 --> 00:46.600
 of people to participate in the global economy

00:46.600 --> 00:48.840
 in a way that resists the manipulation

00:48.840 --> 00:50.640
 by centralized power.

00:50.640 --> 00:54.000
 Also with smart contracts, layer two technologies,

00:54.000 --> 00:56.560
 data pools, NFTs, and of course,

00:56.560 --> 00:58.920
 integration of artificial intelligence

00:58.920 --> 01:01.040
 into the whole thing, we have the opportunity

01:01.040 --> 01:04.680
 to build tools and worlds that transform physical

01:04.680 --> 01:06.700
 and digital life as we know it,

01:06.700 --> 01:09.700
 hopefully minimizing the suffering in the world

01:09.700 --> 01:12.500
 and maximizing the fun.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.960
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast

01:14.960 --> 01:18.540
 and here is my conversation with Vitalik Buterin.

01:19.540 --> 01:23.140
 Let's first talk about Shiba Inu, if we can.

01:23.140 --> 01:27.320
 Also known as Shiba Token, code SHIB,

01:27.320 --> 01:31.440
 for context, Shiba Inu was created in August 2020,

01:31.440 --> 01:34.960
 modeled off of Dogecoin by the anonymous founder

01:34.960 --> 01:37.380
 known as Ryoshi.

01:37.380 --> 01:42.120
 On May 10th this year, it had a market capitalization

01:42.120 --> 01:45.300
 of over 13 billion.

01:45.300 --> 01:48.440
 And maybe you can explain this, but in a crazy move,

01:48.440 --> 01:52.760
 you were given half of SHIB's total supply.

01:52.760 --> 01:57.760
 You burned, a.k.a. destroyed 90% of it.

01:58.480 --> 02:03.480
 That's worth $6.7 billion.

02:03.480 --> 02:08.480
 And you donated 10%, that's worth 1.2 billion at the time

02:09.800 --> 02:13.380
 to an India COVID 19 relief fund,

02:13.380 --> 02:17.760
 saying you don't want to be the locus of this much power.

02:17.760 --> 02:20.760
 This is fascinating.

02:20.760 --> 02:23.620
 Why and how were you able to walk away

02:23.620 --> 02:26.600
 from this much money and this much power?

02:26.600 --> 02:31.040
 So I should probably start by giving some of the backstory

02:31.040 --> 02:35.560
 around these coins and this concept of giving me coins.

02:35.560 --> 02:38.440
 So first of all, Shiba Inu, as you said,

02:38.440 --> 02:40.800
 is this kind of knockoff of Dogecoin, right?

02:40.800 --> 02:44.480
 And Dogecoin was this initial kind of fun coin

02:44.480 --> 02:47.320
 that was created back, I think, around 2014 or so.

02:47.320 --> 02:50.000
 And it was just created by Jackson Palmer

02:50.000 --> 02:52.240
 who put it out as a joke for a couple of hours

02:52.240 --> 02:53.960
 and a community formed around it.

02:53.960 --> 02:57.680
 And at the beginning, people didn't take it very seriously.

02:57.680 --> 03:01.040
 I actually remember putting about $25,000 into Doge

03:01.040 --> 03:02.360
 sometime around 2016.

03:02.360 --> 03:05.600
 And I just remember thinking to myself,

03:05.600 --> 03:08.880
 okay, how am I going to explain to my mom

03:08.880 --> 03:12.520
 that I just invested $25,000 into Dogecoins?

03:12.520 --> 03:14.200
 And what even are Dogecoins?

03:14.200 --> 03:16.300
 The only interesting thing about this coin

03:16.300 --> 03:19.840
 is that there's a logo of a dog somewhere.

03:19.840 --> 03:21.960
 But of course, that ended up being one of the best

03:21.960 --> 03:24.880
 investments I've ever made and it did really well.

03:24.880 --> 03:28.600
 And then at the end of 2020, Elon Musk, of course,

03:28.600 --> 03:31.920
 started talking about Dogecoin and the market cap

03:31.920 --> 03:35.600
 just shot up to about $50 billion.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.720
 Actually, it shot up multiple times, right?

03:37.720 --> 03:40.920
 Like the first time it went up from about 0.8 cents

03:40.920 --> 03:42.680
 to about like 7 cents.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.160
 And this just happened all in one day.

03:44.160 --> 03:48.440
 And I remember this was when I was still in Singapore

03:48.440 --> 03:53.440
 in the middle of COVID and I saw that the price

03:53.440 --> 03:56.080
 just went up by 1000% and I was like,

03:56.080 --> 03:59.200
 oh my God, my Doge is worth like a lot.

03:59.200 --> 04:02.800
 And so I immediately called up some of my friends

04:02.800 --> 04:05.440
 and told them to like drop everything and scramble.

04:05.440 --> 04:09.320
 And I sold half the Doge and I got $4.3 million,

04:09.320 --> 04:11.360
 donated the proceeds to give directly.

04:11.360 --> 04:13.640
 And a few hours after I did this,

04:13.640 --> 04:16.480
 the price dropped back down from about 7 cents to 4 cents.

04:16.480 --> 04:18.120
 So I managed to sell the Doge at the top

04:18.120 --> 04:20.040
 and I remember just that feeling

04:20.040 --> 04:22.240
 like I was such an amazing trader.

04:22.240 --> 04:24.720
 But then of course, the price went up from 4 cents

04:24.720 --> 04:28.560
 then to 7 and then 50 and just like Doge becoming

04:28.560 --> 04:32.200
 this big phenomenon where there's even a lot of people

04:32.200 --> 04:34.120
 that have heard of Doge that have not heard of Ethereum

04:34.120 --> 04:36.800
 is just like something even I wasn't predicting, right?

04:36.800 --> 04:38.960
 And so after that, of course, we have Doge

04:38.960 --> 04:41.120
 and then people are thinking, well,

04:41.120 --> 04:43.520
 if the leading DOG token is worth $50 billion,

04:43.520 --> 04:47.720
 then surely the second largest DOG token deserves

04:47.720 --> 04:49.680
 at least seven or 8 billion, right?

04:49.680 --> 04:52.000
 Like, I feel like that's the kind of what the mindset

04:52.000 --> 04:54.600
 of these Shiba people is.

04:54.600 --> 04:57.080
 So that of course, they did this other gimmick, right?

04:57.080 --> 04:59.880
 Where they gave me half the Shiba token supply.

05:00.920 --> 05:03.480
 They were actually not the first projects to do this.

05:03.480 --> 05:06.040
 So around the end of 2020,

05:06.040 --> 05:08.720
 there was this weird project called Teller.

05:08.720 --> 05:10.400
 It's like T E L L O R.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.040
 I think they're a chain link competitor

05:12.040 --> 05:13.280
 or something like this.

05:13.280 --> 05:16.920
 But I remember they just like dumped $50,000

05:16.920 --> 05:18.760
 worth of their token into my wallet.

05:18.760 --> 05:20.120
 And then they had their Twitter army

05:20.120 --> 05:22.040
 just like basically run around saying,

05:22.040 --> 05:24.520
 look, look at Vitalik's wallet, Vitalik holds Tellers.

05:24.520 --> 05:26.320
 He's one of us, he's a supporter.

05:26.320 --> 05:27.800
 And as soon as I discovered this,

05:27.800 --> 05:31.520
 I just like publicly sold the Teller tokens on Uniswap.

05:31.520 --> 05:34.440
 And this created a bit of a Twitter splat.

05:34.440 --> 05:36.880
 Now, the Shiba people were more clever.

05:36.880 --> 05:39.240
 The Shiba people, instead of dumping to that wallet,

05:39.240 --> 05:41.480
 they dumped to my cold wallet, right?

05:41.480 --> 05:43.520
 So in a cryptocurrency, right,

05:43.520 --> 05:45.720
 there's this concept of like cold wallets and hot wallets.

05:45.720 --> 05:49.600
 Basically, like the thing that actually owns your money

05:49.600 --> 05:52.800
 is like this 80 digit number called a private key, right?

05:52.800 --> 05:54.520
 And a hot wallet is when that private key

05:54.520 --> 05:56.680
 is just stored in memory on your computer,

05:56.680 --> 05:58.840
 on your phone, really easy to access.

05:58.840 --> 06:01.800
 Cold wallet means it's either written down

06:01.800 --> 06:04.840
 on a piece of paper or it's on a computer

06:04.840 --> 06:07.080
 that's just never accessed the internet, right?

06:07.080 --> 06:08.440
 So cold is very inconvenient,

06:08.440 --> 06:10.640
 but cold is also much more secure, right?

06:10.640 --> 06:13.720
 Because even if that computer has some viruses on it,

06:13.720 --> 06:15.920
 like it's like air gapped,

06:15.920 --> 06:17.800
 it's not actually going to be able to upload it.

06:17.800 --> 06:21.280
 So this cold wallet and like all the money

06:21.280 --> 06:22.320
 is out of the cold wallet,

06:22.320 --> 06:24.480
 so it's safe for me to talk about my setup now, right?

06:24.480 --> 06:27.560
 But it was a laptop that was sitting in Canada.

06:27.560 --> 06:30.920
 And I also had two pieces of paper

06:30.920 --> 06:32.560
 where I wrote down two numbers

06:32.560 --> 06:33.880
 on those two pieces of paper.

06:33.880 --> 06:35.720
 One was with me, one was in Canada.

06:35.720 --> 06:37.360
 And if you add those two numbers together,

06:37.360 --> 06:38.760
 you get the private key.

06:38.760 --> 06:41.320
 So because of COVID travel restrictions,

06:41.320 --> 06:44.240
 and this cold wallets in Canada,

06:44.240 --> 06:48.000
 like it's very difficult for me to actually access it, right?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.960
 And I'm not sure if they knew this,

06:49.960 --> 06:51.120
 maybe they just got lucky,

06:51.120 --> 06:55.840
 but basically they sent a lot of these dog tokens

06:55.840 --> 06:59.440
 into this wallet where it was very difficult

06:59.440 --> 07:00.400
 for me to access it.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.400
 But then I saw these dog tokens,

07:02.400 --> 07:04.120
 I saw more and more people talking about them.

07:04.120 --> 07:06.920
 And then at some point I realized that like,

07:06.920 --> 07:09.240
 hey, these things are worth billions of dollars.

07:09.240 --> 07:11.840
 And like, no, there's lots of really good things

07:11.840 --> 07:13.080
 that you could do with that amount of money.

07:13.080 --> 07:16.120
 And it would actually be a waste to just like see it go.

07:16.120 --> 07:18.760
 So I made the decision that like,

07:18.760 --> 07:20.200
 I would actually power through

07:20.200 --> 07:23.000
 and figure out how to like safely,

07:23.000 --> 07:24.960
 like basically get my private key.

07:24.960 --> 07:27.240
 I actually had to call up my family,

07:27.240 --> 07:29.200
 tell them to read out their number

07:29.200 --> 07:30.640
 off of their piece of paper.

07:30.640 --> 07:34.360
 I entered that into a fresh laptop

07:34.360 --> 07:35.360
 that I bought from Target.

07:35.360 --> 07:38.840
 Then I put in my other number on my piece of paper,

07:38.840 --> 07:40.600
 added the two numbers together on the computer,

07:40.600 --> 07:41.600
 there's the key.

07:41.600 --> 07:45.520
 And at the same time, like just scrambled for two days,

07:45.520 --> 07:47.000
 setting up a new wallet

07:47.000 --> 07:48.800
 where I could move my ETH to safely,

07:48.800 --> 07:50.760
 like getting people to be multisig partners,

07:50.760 --> 07:53.920
 just like doing all sorts of like stuff

07:53.920 --> 07:56.000
 that 10 years ago you would expect

07:56.000 --> 07:58.640
 to just be part of a cyberpunk science fiction novel,

07:58.640 --> 07:59.960
 but now it's all real.

07:59.960 --> 08:03.120
 So you're doing this all by yourself, essentially.

08:03.120 --> 08:04.280
 Most of it by myself.

08:04.280 --> 08:05.760
 So you have to keep it secret.

08:05.760 --> 08:09.560
 Right, and I needed my family to actually like go

08:09.560 --> 08:12.200
 and read the number on their piece of paper.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.640
 And then in my new multisig wallet,

08:15.640 --> 08:19.120
 like there's other people that are signatories,

08:19.120 --> 08:22.960
 but I'm obviously not gonna reveal any details beyond that.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.760
 So I did this, right?

08:24.760 --> 08:28.120
 And I actually managed to like get the private key,

08:28.120 --> 08:30.800
 make the first transaction that would just move all my ETH

08:30.800 --> 08:32.680
 to the multisig wallet so it's safe.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.800
 And then second transact,

08:34.800 --> 08:36.400
 put the private key on my main computer,

08:36.400 --> 08:39.520
 then started going in and just selling some

08:39.520 --> 08:41.480
 of the dog tokens and then just like giving them

08:41.480 --> 08:43.400
 to these different charities.

08:43.400 --> 08:48.400
 Now, at the time I actually did not even like have any idea

08:49.200 --> 08:50.600
 of how much you would be able to get, right?

08:50.600 --> 08:53.840
 Because like on paper, the dog tokens are $7 billion,

08:53.840 --> 08:56.480
 but like in reality, it's a very liquid market.

08:56.480 --> 09:00.200
 Are you gonna crash it after you sell 1 million worth

09:00.200 --> 09:03.000
 or are you gonna crash it after 10 million?

09:03.000 --> 09:06.760
 Might you actually be able to get like an entire 200 million?

09:06.760 --> 09:07.840
 I had no idea.

09:08.760 --> 09:12.840
 So I definitely was just over the mindset,

09:12.840 --> 09:14.560
 like, okay, I mean, I'll sell a bit,

09:14.560 --> 09:17.280
 maybe I get some ETH and then donated some ETH

09:17.280 --> 09:19.160
 to give well, donated some to other groups.

09:19.160 --> 09:21.000
 And then, okay, have some dog tokens.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.360
 Like I don't have an easy ability to sell more myself,

09:23.360 --> 09:25.720
 but then I'll just like give them to these groups

09:25.720 --> 09:29.000
 and like, hopefully they'll do good things with them.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.040
 It was actually, I actually donated at 20%

09:32.040 --> 09:33.880
 then dumped 80%.

09:33.880 --> 09:38.440
 Yeah, so the COVID India group got one batch

09:38.440 --> 09:40.920
 and then there's another group that got another batch.

09:40.920 --> 09:42.360
 And I don't wanna say who they are

09:42.360 --> 09:44.440
 cause I think that they wanna announce themselves

09:44.440 --> 09:45.280
 at some point.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.120
 Sure.

09:46.120 --> 09:48.480
 Yeah, but you can see the fact

09:48.480 --> 09:50.800
 that these transactions were made on the blockchain,

09:50.800 --> 09:55.800
 but it was just very interesting and unexpected

09:57.160 --> 10:00.760
 and just an insanely crazy situation.

10:00.760 --> 10:02.880
 It's been a couple of weeks.

10:02.880 --> 10:06.000
 First of all, thank you for helping me hang up some curtains.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.400
 This is a first for the podcast

10:08.400 --> 10:12.120
 and shows that you're a truly a special person

10:13.520 --> 10:14.760
 to be willing to help.

10:14.760 --> 10:16.600
 But now a couple of weeks later,

10:16.600 --> 10:19.220
 do you regret any aspect of that decision?

10:20.480 --> 10:21.680
 I'm sure there is some things

10:21.680 --> 10:23.600
 that I probably could have done better.

10:23.600 --> 10:27.720
 Like I was actually talking to some of these charities

10:27.720 --> 10:30.960
 and I was impressed by just how much money they managed

10:30.960 --> 10:32.840
 to get out of selling some of these coins.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.760
 So I probably could have done better

10:35.760 --> 10:38.560
 by just talking more with the traders

10:38.560 --> 10:43.440
 and actually ensuring that they can do a better job

10:43.440 --> 10:48.440
 of maximizing the value of all of them.

10:48.760 --> 10:52.320
 But it was a very stressful time

10:52.320 --> 10:53.680
 and I did have to act quickly.

10:53.680 --> 10:57.240
 Like I did manage to make a lot of the donations

10:57.240 --> 11:01.200
 before, a few days before the great crypto crash happened.

11:01.200 --> 11:06.200
 So it was, it's difficult to,

11:06.400 --> 11:08.860
 obviously there's parallel universes in which I did better,

11:08.860 --> 11:10.160
 but at the same time,

11:10.160 --> 11:12.400
 there's also lots of parallel universes

11:12.400 --> 11:14.320
 where because I hesitated more

11:14.320 --> 11:16.120
 and tried to spend more time thinking I missed

11:16.120 --> 11:17.600
 the opportunity.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.520
 So on that, it's like a luck of the draw

11:20.520 --> 11:25.520
 and I'm just happy that everything was able to turn out

11:25.520 --> 11:27.280
 as well as it did.

11:27.280 --> 11:30.280
 But psychologically, you mentioned stress.

11:30.280 --> 11:31.280
 How hard was it?

11:32.240 --> 11:33.240
 It was stressful, right?

11:33.240 --> 11:35.540
 I think, well, one of the really stressful parts

11:35.540 --> 11:39.240
 was just the fact that I had to basically move

11:39.240 --> 11:42.760
 all of my funds, including the 325,000 ether

11:42.760 --> 11:45.040
 from one cold wallet into another hot wallet,

11:45.040 --> 11:47.400
 or sorry, into another multi SIG wallet.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.880
 And maybe the multi SIG wallet had a bug in it.

11:50.880 --> 11:53.800
 Maybe there's like some mistake I'll make in the middle

11:53.800 --> 11:55.760
 that causes the funds to get lost.

11:55.760 --> 11:58.800
 You know, that part was stressful.

11:58.800 --> 12:01.880
 And I was definitely stressing out for two days.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.560
 I mean, triple checking the new wallet.

12:03.560 --> 12:05.660
 I even did a bit of an audit of the code myself.

12:05.660 --> 12:10.040
 I wrote my own JavaScript to DAP to make confirmations

12:10.040 --> 12:14.000
 because Gnosis Safe didn't work with the status wallet well.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.520
 So there was definitely,

12:16.520 --> 12:19.600
 that whole thing was definitely a bit of a marathon.

12:19.600 --> 12:23.440
 I was also a kind of definitely a bit worried

12:23.440 --> 12:26.640
 about or uncertain, I guess, how the public

12:26.640 --> 12:28.920
 and including the coin communities

12:28.920 --> 12:30.420
 would perceive the whole thing.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.520
 But I was actually impressed.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.800
 Like I, for every poster that was saying like,

12:36.800 --> 12:40.880
 no, you know, why did Vitalik like rug pull on us?

12:40.880 --> 12:44.640
 He was, his wallet was supposed to be a burn address.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.760
 You know, there's like 10 people that are like,

12:46.760 --> 12:49.080
 oh, you know, I thought I was just in this

12:49.080 --> 12:52.000
 because it's a fun pyramid gambling thing.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.680
 But instead I ended up being part of this, you know,

12:54.680 --> 12:56.320
 great public good thing for humanity.

12:56.320 --> 12:58.360
 And that's like even more amazing.

12:58.360 --> 13:03.360
 So the amounts of that that I got was very impressive.

13:03.640 --> 13:05.120
 So, you know, all in all, you know,

13:05.120 --> 13:07.640
 I think the dog people did great.

13:07.640 --> 13:08.520
 The dog people.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.600
 Is there something you can extend

13:10.600 --> 13:11.960
 to the bigger picture of it

13:12.960 --> 13:15.640
 in the principles you apply to making this decision?

13:15.640 --> 13:18.280
 Is there some principles, philosophies

13:18.280 --> 13:22.240
 that you apply also to the decisions you make

13:22.240 --> 13:23.440
 around Ethereum?

13:24.800 --> 13:28.520
 I think a big one for me is just this idea

13:28.520 --> 13:32.800
 that crypto, you know, isn't just an opportunity

13:32.800 --> 13:35.800
 to give people like slightly better ways

13:35.800 --> 13:37.880
 to save value in all of these things.

13:37.880 --> 13:42.000
 Like it's also an opportunity to like basically create

13:42.000 --> 13:44.520
 these like new digital institutions

13:44.520 --> 13:47.140
 that could serve the public good in new ways.

13:47.140 --> 13:50.880
 And that's something that I've been interested in

13:50.880 --> 13:51.720
 for a long time.

13:51.720 --> 13:55.000
 I actually even have this article in Bitcoin Magazine

13:55.000 --> 13:58.400
 back in 2014, where I basically suggested this idea

13:58.400 --> 14:00.920
 that, you know, you would have coins that represent causes

14:00.920 --> 14:03.760
 and like people would just like buy and accept those coins

14:03.760 --> 14:05.400
 because they support those causes.

14:05.400 --> 14:09.120
 So I think it's called markets, institutions, and currencies,

14:09.120 --> 14:11.520
 a new form of social incentivization or something like that.

14:11.520 --> 14:14.320
 And I'm sure you can find it and throw it in the links.

14:14.320 --> 14:19.320
 So that was interesting to kind of see becoming real.

14:19.620 --> 14:21.940
 And like in general, I think, you know,

14:21.940 --> 14:23.420
 public goods are very important

14:23.420 --> 14:26.460
 and on the internet, public goods are even more important.

14:26.460 --> 14:30.300
 Like every single Lex Friedman podcast is just on YouTube

14:30.300 --> 14:31.980
 and no anyone can go and see it.

14:31.980 --> 14:35.740
 Like there's no way for you to like, you know, sell it

14:35.740 --> 14:37.740
 and so that some people can see it,

14:37.740 --> 14:38.920
 but then other people can't see it.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.000
 Like, you know, you could do that,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.860
 but then you'd obviously be reducing your impact.

14:42.860 --> 14:47.100
 So thank you for making the amazing Lex Friedman podcast

14:47.100 --> 14:48.260
 so freely available.

14:48.260 --> 14:51.940
 Well, that's actually a tense thing is how do you do it

14:51.940 --> 14:55.620
 in a way that's not controlled in a centralized fashion?

14:55.620 --> 14:59.140
 Cause actually YouTube feels free and open,

14:59.140 --> 15:00.700
 but it nevertheless is one company

15:00.700 --> 15:01.980
 making centralized decisions.

15:01.980 --> 15:05.780
 And the first time I realized YouTube is not forever

15:05.780 --> 15:10.020
 is when a lot of the Joe Rogan experience library

15:10.020 --> 15:13.460
 was pulled from YouTube as part of the Spotify deal.

15:13.460 --> 15:17.080
 And it made me realize we need to,

15:17.080 --> 15:20.860
 it's like the realization that fiat money is centralized

15:20.860 --> 15:25.740
 is realizing that, you know, this is not forever

15:25.740 --> 15:28.740
 and you might want to come up with schemes to distribute it,

15:28.740 --> 15:31.480
 to decentralize the control of it

15:31.480 --> 15:34.620
 in a way that audio for podcasts is just an RSS feed.

15:34.620 --> 15:35.460
 Exactly.

15:35.460 --> 15:38.080
 And I think one of the kind of philosophical things

15:38.080 --> 15:40.860
 that I hope to achieve is kind of decouple

15:40.860 --> 15:42.720
 the concept of public goods,

15:42.720 --> 15:44.460
 which are incredibly important

15:44.460 --> 15:46.820
 and are the lifeblood of modern civilization

15:46.820 --> 15:50.980
 from the idea that there is or can be

15:50.980 --> 15:53.780
 one central organization that represents the public

15:53.780 --> 15:57.540
 and like perfectly understands and can impose their idea

15:57.540 --> 15:58.960
 of what is the good, right?

15:58.960 --> 16:02.340
 Like it's, when people talk about public goods,

16:02.340 --> 16:05.260
 it just often comes with this baggage of, you know,

16:05.260 --> 16:07.380
 either centralization or conformism.

16:07.380 --> 16:09.460
 And I think like it doesn't have to, right?

16:09.460 --> 16:12.260
 Like often the most important public goods

16:12.260 --> 16:14.380
 are the ones that are created by, you know,

16:14.380 --> 16:17.560
 the crazy individualists that disagree with everyone else.

16:17.560 --> 16:21.260
 So trying to make this kind of synthesis

16:21.260 --> 16:24.740
 where you combine the values of decentralization

16:24.740 --> 16:26.420
 and the values of open source,

16:26.420 --> 16:29.100
 but you're not naive about it.

16:29.100 --> 16:31.700
 And like, you know, you realize that

16:31.700 --> 16:33.700
 for these things to be produced,

16:33.700 --> 16:36.060
 there needs to be a way for it to be sustainable.

16:36.060 --> 16:38.340
 There needs to be some way of supporting people

16:38.340 --> 16:39.900
 who are working these projects.

16:39.900 --> 16:40.940
 But at the same time,

16:40.940 --> 16:44.300
 you want to avoid that turning into

16:44.300 --> 16:45.780
 a vector of centralization,

16:45.780 --> 16:49.980
 like trying to sort of get all of the good things

16:49.980 --> 16:50.940
 without the bad things.

16:50.940 --> 16:55.480
 To me, that's a big part of sort of

16:55.480 --> 16:58.100
 what my grand experiment in crypto is about.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.060
 And like, we are doing things

17:00.060 --> 17:02.540
 in different kinds of things for this, right?

17:02.540 --> 17:05.620
 Like there's the Gitcoin Grants quadratic funding

17:05.620 --> 17:07.500
 in the Ethereum ecosystem.

17:07.500 --> 17:10.380
 There's obviously these dog coins

17:10.380 --> 17:13.120
 that just happens, I guess, accidentally.

17:14.040 --> 17:17.740
 There's other projects that, like for example,

17:17.740 --> 17:21.020
 you know, Uniswap has their Uniswap DAO

17:21.020 --> 17:22.620
 that just has a huge amount of funding.

17:22.620 --> 17:25.620
 And like, we haven't seen yet how that's going to be deployed,

17:25.620 --> 17:28.540
 but, you know, it could be potentially deployed

17:28.540 --> 17:31.640
 to do lots of really good and amazing things.

17:31.640 --> 17:36.020
 Do you see Ethereum as essentially a mechanism

17:36.020 --> 17:38.700
 to fight for social causes?

17:41.160 --> 17:46.160
 I definitely see Ethereum as being a mechanism

17:46.700 --> 17:51.700
 to fight for definitely some specific things

17:52.180 --> 17:54.900
 that are social causes.

17:54.900 --> 17:57.100
 Like just, you know,

17:57.100 --> 17:59.600
 the fact of creating an open financial system

17:59.600 --> 18:00.920
 that anyone can participate in

18:00.920 --> 18:02.280
 no matter where they are in the world,

18:02.280 --> 18:03.660
 that's a social cause.

18:03.660 --> 18:05.760
 Just, you know, giving people the ability

18:05.760 --> 18:08.180
 to organize and create projects,

18:08.180 --> 18:10.580
 even if it's five people in five different countries.

18:10.580 --> 18:12.260
 I think that kind of inclusiveness,

18:12.260 --> 18:14.140
 I think that's a social cause

18:14.140 --> 18:17.320
 and it's a core crypto value.

18:18.820 --> 18:21.860
 But then at the same time, like the other important

18:21.860 --> 18:23.740
 and if part of the magic of Ethereum

18:23.740 --> 18:25.100
 that you have to balance that against

18:25.100 --> 18:27.820
 is that it is also this open platform

18:27.820 --> 18:29.220
 where ultimately, you know,

18:29.220 --> 18:31.900
 the things that are on Ethereum

18:31.900 --> 18:34.400
 is just the things that the community makes of it.

18:35.540 --> 18:37.660
 Well, you kind of briefly opened the door,

18:37.660 --> 18:39.580
 so let's go there.

18:39.580 --> 18:42.820
 When it comes to government regulation of crypto,

18:44.780 --> 18:46.140
 what's the best case scenario?

18:46.140 --> 18:48.460
 What's the worst case scenario?

18:48.460 --> 18:52.580
 In terms of, you know, as you've kind of mentioned,

18:52.580 --> 18:57.020
 Ethereum challenges the power centers of the world

18:57.020 --> 19:01.980
 and how do you see the interplay between governments

19:01.980 --> 19:05.220
 and this new technology that resists centralized power?

19:06.220 --> 19:08.080
 Best case and worst case.

19:08.080 --> 19:13.080
 The best case is that, you know,

19:14.460 --> 19:17.020
 blockchains continue to prosper

19:17.020 --> 19:18.700
 and we figure out scalability

19:18.700 --> 19:22.380
 so that people can actually start doing things on block,

19:22.380 --> 19:24.660
 like, you know, all of the amazing use cases

19:24.660 --> 19:25.820
 that people have been talking about

19:25.820 --> 19:28.420
 instead of today where a lot of the great stuff

19:28.420 --> 19:29.860
 gets priced out because, you know,

19:29.860 --> 19:32.140
 transaction fees are at five to $10

19:32.140 --> 19:36.420
 and then we see a lot of different amazing applications

19:36.420 --> 19:37.500
 happening on blockchains.

19:37.500 --> 19:41.820
 You know, it could be like DAO is creating new ways

19:41.820 --> 19:44.900
 for people to interact and organize with each other

19:44.900 --> 19:46.580
 and new ways for artists to get funded

19:46.580 --> 19:50.120
 and just all sorts of these amazing things

19:50.120 --> 19:55.120
 and there's just enough public support

19:55.900 --> 19:57.820
 and just enough people that see that, you know,

19:57.820 --> 20:01.300
 look, crypto is clearly doing a lot of good things

20:01.300 --> 20:03.620
 and, you know, there are definitely areas

20:03.620 --> 20:04.700
 where there's tensions,

20:04.700 --> 20:08.200
 but in those areas where there's tensions,

20:08.200 --> 20:10.500
 like, there could be some kind of creative

20:10.500 --> 20:13.060
 and interesting approaches that get figured out, right?

20:13.060 --> 20:16.300
 Like, you know, the concept of corporate taxes,

20:16.300 --> 20:17.140
 for example, right?

20:17.140 --> 20:21.060
 Like, you know, that would disappear as a revenue stream

20:21.060 --> 20:23.780
 if theoretically corporations just all get replaced by DAOs

20:23.780 --> 20:28.220
 but, you know, like maybe there's some other creative way

20:28.220 --> 20:33.220
 by which DAOs themselves can kind of be code,

20:34.680 --> 20:36.480
 you know, have some kind of encoded governance

20:36.480 --> 20:41.120
 that ensures that they have at least some kind of bias

20:41.120 --> 20:43.260
 towards serving the global public good

20:43.260 --> 20:47.660
 and, you know, maybe DAOs can do enough of that

20:47.660 --> 20:48.900
 that people are happy with it.

20:48.900 --> 20:51.100
 And, you know, there are going to be things

20:51.100 --> 20:52.220
 that people are unhappy about.

20:52.220 --> 20:53.420
 There's always gonna be the people

20:53.420 --> 20:55.700
 that, you know, wants to surveil everyone

20:55.700 --> 21:00.700
 but if the kind of effect of crypto

21:01.380 --> 21:04.300
 from just empowering people is greater than that

21:04.300 --> 21:05.360
 and greater than that in a way

21:05.360 --> 21:07.200
 that people can just easily see,

21:07.200 --> 21:09.280
 then, you know, that would be a good scenario, right?

21:09.280 --> 21:13.580
 And we'll just become kind of incorporated and accepted

21:13.580 --> 21:16.500
 the same way as happened with the internet.

21:16.500 --> 21:19.820
 But in the worst case scenario would, of course,

21:19.820 --> 21:23.340
 be just like people suddenly, you know,

21:23.340 --> 21:25.460
 flipping and going into moral panic mode

21:25.460 --> 21:27.000
 and just, you know, oh my God,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.500
 like this technology is used by like, you know,

21:29.500 --> 21:31.180
 insert bad group over the day.

21:31.180 --> 21:33.780
 And then I don't think governments have the ability

21:33.780 --> 21:36.940
 to ban crypto to the extent of just complete

21:36.940 --> 21:39.340
 like preventing blockchains from existing

21:39.340 --> 21:40.740
 but they definitely have the ability

21:40.740 --> 21:42.460
 to really marginalize it, right?

21:42.460 --> 21:45.300
 Like if you just ban all exchanges,

21:45.300 --> 21:48.380
 like in ban all links from the Fiat ecosystem to crypto

21:48.380 --> 21:51.420
 and, you know, you ban all kind of mainstream employers

21:51.420 --> 21:54.660
 from accepting or paying in cryptocurrency,

21:54.660 --> 21:59.660
 then like you can successfully like turn it into a,

22:01.100 --> 22:03.940
 like, you know, a fairly kind of niche countercultural thing

22:03.940 --> 22:07.540
 that has much less impact than otherwise would.

22:07.540 --> 22:09.860
 So it's somewhere between the good scenario

22:09.860 --> 22:10.680
 and the bad scenario.

22:10.680 --> 22:12.460
 I'm obviously hoping for the good.

22:12.460 --> 22:14.020
 Well, that's interesting also the tension

22:14.020 --> 22:17.620
 between governments and companies.

22:17.620 --> 22:19.300
 Like if you have a bunch of billionaires

22:19.300 --> 22:22.100
 or a bunch of companies like Tesla investing in Bitcoin

22:22.100 --> 22:24.700
 and then governments resisting that,

22:24.700 --> 22:27.740
 it's interesting who wins out in that worst case scenario.

22:27.740 --> 22:34.020
 And almost when companies and rich, quote unquote,

22:34.020 --> 22:37.840
 respectable people embrace cryptocurrencies,

22:37.840 --> 22:41.780
 Bitcoin, Ethereum, so on, even the dot coins,

22:41.780 --> 22:44.180
 it's almost sends a signal to everybody else

22:44.180 --> 22:48.080
 that this is a revolution that's here to stay.

22:49.300 --> 22:51.600
 On this one little tangent that you brought up,

22:52.500 --> 22:55.900
 this is almost an outdated idea, but it's still with us,

22:55.900 --> 22:59.740
 which is cryptocurrencies are used for illegal activity,

22:59.740 --> 23:02.060
 for drugs, for crime, and so on.

23:02.940 --> 23:05.820
 Is there some sense that worries you

23:05.820 --> 23:10.820
 that if cryptocurrency, if Ethereum runs the world,

23:11.900 --> 23:16.900
 then making money from crime will be easier?

23:17.060 --> 23:20.320
 There's always that possibility, but like at the same time,

23:20.320 --> 23:23.180
 I think if you look at, you know, the world as a whole

23:23.180 --> 23:26.260
 and like the way all the other technological trends

23:26.260 --> 23:28.500
 are going, like, you know, in person surveillance

23:28.500 --> 23:30.420
 is just going up every year, right?

23:30.420 --> 23:34.260
 Like if you commit a crime in, you know, meat space,

23:34.260 --> 23:36.700
 it's getting harder and harder to get away with it.

23:36.700 --> 23:40.120
 So like, you know, if you wants to do something,

23:40.120 --> 23:42.560
 and this is something that's just like happening

23:42.560 --> 23:45.060
 as a result of, you know, just better technology

23:45.060 --> 23:46.900
 and information transparency,

23:46.900 --> 23:51.100
 like a lot of it's hard to prevent even if you really tried.

23:51.100 --> 23:56.100
 So the world where like things go dark to such an extent,

23:57.820 --> 24:01.580
 you know, as the police hawks sometimes like to say,

24:01.580 --> 24:04.340
 to such an extent that like, you know, oh my God,

24:04.340 --> 24:06.340
 the criminals are committing crimes with impunity

24:06.340 --> 24:09.820
 and we can't see anything, like that just seems unlikely.

24:09.820 --> 24:11.540
 But, you know, on the other hand,

24:11.540 --> 24:16.540
 like the world where there just, you know,

24:16.540 --> 24:21.540
 is no privacy, for example, or the world where there just

24:21.900 --> 24:26.900
 like is no ability to kind of act outside of the confines

24:28.940 --> 24:30.740
 of, you know, mainstream institutions,

24:30.740 --> 24:34.860
 like that's something that's more realistic

24:34.860 --> 24:37.940
 and that seems like something that could lead

24:37.940 --> 24:40.820
 to a lot of kind of a lot of scary things, right?

24:40.820 --> 24:42.820
 And like, even from a government's point of view, right?

24:42.820 --> 24:45.220
 Like I think governments over the last few years,

24:45.220 --> 24:47.860
 a lot of them, they're very worried about sovereignty.

24:47.860 --> 24:49.020
 You know, they're worried about like,

24:49.020 --> 24:53.540
 if their country is economies and, you know,

24:53.540 --> 24:55.940
 social environments are just completely dependent

24:55.940 --> 24:58.180
 on basically foreign tech companies controlled

24:58.180 --> 24:59.620
 by foreign governments, like, you know,

24:59.620 --> 25:01.220
 governments are not on team government, right?

25:01.220 --> 25:04.180
 It's like, you know, the Indian government is on,

25:04.180 --> 25:06.380
 you know, team India, then the Russian government

25:06.380 --> 25:08.140
 is on team Russia and so forth, right?

25:08.140 --> 25:12.660
 So like, you know, they don't want the US to be able

25:12.660 --> 25:14.980
 to like have this big backdoor into everything.

25:14.980 --> 25:17.980
 So, I mean, I do think that a balance is needed,

25:17.980 --> 25:22.980
 but at the same time, I do think,

25:24.940 --> 25:28.700
 I guess I definitely like worry more

25:28.700 --> 25:33.700
 about the possibility that just like without things

25:35.220 --> 25:38.740
 to like crypto kind of acting outside of institutions

25:38.740 --> 25:40.860
 becomes too impossible.

25:40.860 --> 25:42.660
 And I don't even necessarily mean outside of governments,

25:42.660 --> 25:44.260
 even just, you know, outside of corporations,

25:44.260 --> 25:45.420
 like becomes too impossible.

25:45.420 --> 25:46.580
 And there's just like terrible things

25:46.580 --> 25:48.340
 that come as a result.

25:48.340 --> 25:50.220
 I mean, if things going in the other direction,

25:50.220 --> 25:54.460
 like it obviously is a risk, but no,

25:54.460 --> 25:56.780
 at the same time, I think in the longterm,

25:56.780 --> 26:01.620
 like a crypto can potentially even like offer defenses

26:01.620 --> 26:03.420
 as much as attacks against that sort of thing.

26:03.420 --> 26:05.460
 Yeah, many throughout history,

26:05.460 --> 26:07.300
 many of the most destructive things came

26:07.300 --> 26:10.260
 from centralized institutions versus sort of

26:10.260 --> 26:13.100
 from the people operating in the shadows.

26:13.100 --> 26:15.420
 And, you know, I've been talking to a bunch

26:15.420 --> 26:18.140
 of psychedelics folks that people doing researches

26:18.140 --> 26:21.420
 like Rick Doblin in Johns Hopkins,

26:21.420 --> 26:23.780
 there's a lot of exciting research on psychedelics.

26:23.780 --> 26:26.380
 And one thing you could say about operating

26:26.380 --> 26:28.420
 at the edge of legality,

26:28.420 --> 26:32.460
 it could actually accelerate the adoption

26:32.460 --> 26:36.460
 of particular things like whether it's marijuana

26:36.460 --> 26:39.220
 or psychedelics, they can help people out.

26:39.220 --> 26:41.460
 It's almost accelerates the policy.

26:41.460 --> 26:43.340
 It forces the policy to catch up

26:43.340 --> 26:44.820
 to where the people stand.

26:44.820 --> 26:47.180
 So there's a positive way of doing things

26:47.180 --> 26:49.460
 that are in the gray area of legality

26:49.460 --> 26:51.540
 and creating a market that allows people

26:51.540 --> 26:55.540
 to in a safe way be able to participate

26:55.540 --> 26:57.060
 in this gray area of legality.

26:57.060 --> 26:58.660
 The other thing to keep in mind, of course,

26:58.660 --> 27:01.660
 is that the set of like the kinds of things

27:01.660 --> 27:03.940
 that just like payment processors as companies

27:03.940 --> 27:06.700
 try to restrict you from is much larger

27:06.700 --> 27:08.740
 than the set of things that's illegal, right?

27:08.740 --> 27:10.420
 Like part of that is because they wanna be

27:10.420 --> 27:12.780
 super conservative and like the more layers you have,

27:12.780 --> 27:14.700
 the more they're like conservative

27:14.700 --> 27:17.300
 because they're scared of what the layer below them

27:17.300 --> 27:18.940
 will do to them.

27:18.940 --> 27:21.540
 Sometimes they have their own moral opinions

27:21.540 --> 27:23.180
 of various kinds.

27:23.180 --> 27:24.460
 They go after lots of people, right?

27:24.460 --> 27:27.140
 Like they make life really hard for sex workers,

27:27.140 --> 27:30.300
 for example, psychedelics, as you mentioned,

27:30.300 --> 27:34.660
 there's a lot of activity,

27:34.660 --> 27:37.420
 even including stuff that is totally legal

27:37.420 --> 27:40.940
 that just there's this like shadow

27:40.940 --> 27:42.700
 like PayPal credit card governments

27:42.700 --> 27:43.740
 or whatever you wanna call it.

27:43.740 --> 27:47.980
 And that makes it just hard to participate in this stuff.

27:47.980 --> 27:50.380
 So I think like reducing the number of intermediaries

27:50.380 --> 27:54.740
 is definitely normally a good thing.

27:54.740 --> 27:58.060
 All right, let's talk about one of the most exciting

27:58.060 --> 28:01.820
 technologies like technically, philosophically,

28:01.820 --> 28:05.100
 like socially, financially in every way,

28:05.100 --> 28:07.660
 which is Ethereum 2.0.

28:07.660 --> 28:10.460
 There's a million things to talk about,

28:10.460 --> 28:14.020
 but step one is probably a good thing to do,

28:14.020 --> 28:17.620
 which is can you briefly summarize your vision

28:17.620 --> 28:21.020
 how Ethereum 2.0 will make Ethereum more scalable,

28:21.020 --> 28:23.300
 secure and sustainable?

28:23.300 --> 28:27.140
 Sure, so I think recently we've actually been

28:27.140 --> 28:30.660
 kind of deemphasizing the ETH 2.0 branding, I guess.

28:30.660 --> 28:33.620
 So the reason behind that was that originally

28:33.620 --> 28:37.100
 we envisioned something more like a big grand event

28:37.100 --> 28:39.900
 where all the good things would happen at the same time

28:39.900 --> 28:41.860
 and it would be a new blockchain,

28:41.860 --> 28:43.140
 and it would be a new protocol

28:43.140 --> 28:45.260
 and people would have to take a lot of effort

28:45.260 --> 28:46.460
 to migrate over.

28:46.460 --> 28:50.340
 But later we've slowly changed the roadmap

28:50.340 --> 28:53.220
 over to something that's much more incremental, right?

28:53.220 --> 28:56.060
 So proof of stake happens kind of over time

28:56.060 --> 28:57.540
 and then sharding gets added over time

28:57.540 --> 28:59.340
 and all of these features get added over time.

28:59.340 --> 29:02.660
 And so the experience for just a regular Ethereum user

29:02.660 --> 29:04.540
 still feels very seamless, right?

29:04.540 --> 29:06.700
 It's like maybe a little bit more complex

29:06.700 --> 29:09.420
 than the hard forks that we've already done

29:09.420 --> 29:13.140
 from a user's point of view, but not by that much, right?

29:13.140 --> 29:17.900
 So the big two things that are happening, right?

29:17.900 --> 29:19.860
 These are what used to be considered

29:19.860 --> 29:21.860
 the two flagship features of ETH 2.0

29:21.860 --> 29:23.980
 and now they're just the flagship features

29:23.980 --> 29:27.780
 of the next devolution of Ethereum,

29:27.780 --> 29:31.340
 as proof of stake and sharding.

29:31.340 --> 29:34.180
 So proof of stake is a consensus algorithm.

29:34.180 --> 29:38.140
 It's a, or a consensus mechanism, I should say.

29:38.140 --> 29:40.380
 The difference is that like an algorithm

29:40.380 --> 29:41.820
 is something that you run by yourself.

29:41.820 --> 29:45.500
 A mechanism is like interactions between people

29:45.500 --> 29:48.140
 and it could even include incentives and all of that.

29:48.140 --> 29:51.060
 So a consensus mechanism,

29:52.180 --> 29:56.500
 so by which nodes in the network agree on

29:56.500 --> 29:58.580
 which blocks came in, which transactions came in,

29:58.580 --> 30:01.900
 what order, make sure that once a block gets accepted,

30:01.900 --> 30:04.220
 it can't get reverted and all of these things

30:04.220 --> 30:06.220
 that we expect from a blockchain.

30:06.220 --> 30:08.860
 So existing blockchains, including Bitcoin,

30:08.860 --> 30:10.340
 including the Ethereum of today,

30:10.340 --> 30:13.540
 and including a lot of them, they use proof of work, right?

30:13.540 --> 30:17.860
 So the reason why we need proof of anything

30:17.860 --> 30:22.700
 is because they serve this function that I call

30:22.700 --> 30:25.420
 an economic civil resistance.

30:25.420 --> 30:28.660
 So that's obviously a big word for,

30:28.660 --> 30:30.980
 especially if you've never heard of symbols before,

30:30.980 --> 30:32.540
 but like the basic idea is, right,

30:32.540 --> 30:34.580
 that you have a network and you have lots of computers

30:34.580 --> 30:36.900
 that agree on like which blocks to accept.

30:36.900 --> 30:39.340
 And sometimes you get two blocks that get published

30:39.340 --> 30:41.420
 at the same time and you just have to agree on an order.

30:41.420 --> 30:44.220
 So there has to be some kind of voting game.

30:44.220 --> 30:46.820
 But then the question is, well, in this voting game,

30:46.820 --> 30:49.380
 who gets to vote, who gets to participate?

30:49.380 --> 30:52.140
 Now, you can't say one person, one vote, right?

30:52.140 --> 30:54.100
 The reason why you cannot say one person, one vote

30:54.100 --> 30:57.060
 is because you need some kind of like authority

30:57.060 --> 31:00.900
 or some kind of mechanism to say who the humans are.

31:00.900 --> 31:02.940
 And if you don't have that,

31:02.940 --> 31:05.900
 then a bad guy could just come in with a virtual machine

31:05.900 --> 31:08.980
 or with a computer that has on it 10 billion virtual machines

31:08.980 --> 31:11.100
 that have 10 billion virtual nodes.

31:11.100 --> 31:13.860
 And then just like say, look, I'm 99% of the network,

31:13.860 --> 31:15.780
 I should control everything.

31:15.780 --> 31:19.620
 So to prevent this, what proof of work and proof of stake

31:19.620 --> 31:23.180
 both do is they basically say, well, the weight of your vote,

31:23.180 --> 31:27.540
 like how much influence your votes have in the consensus

31:27.540 --> 31:29.980
 is proportional to like what quantity

31:29.980 --> 31:31.780
 of economic resources you bring in.

31:31.780 --> 31:33.380
 So in the case of proof of work,

31:33.380 --> 31:35.340
 you prove what economic resources you have

31:35.340 --> 31:37.460
 because your economic resources are computers

31:37.460 --> 31:38.780
 and you prove that you have them

31:38.780 --> 31:40.420
 by just running them 24 seven

31:40.420 --> 31:42.740
 using these hash algorithms, right?

31:42.740 --> 31:45.020
 So this does solve the problem, right?

31:45.020 --> 31:47.300
 Because in order to attack the network,

31:47.300 --> 31:50.180
 you have to come in with more computers

31:50.180 --> 31:53.300
 and more money invested into computers and electricity

31:53.300 --> 31:55.460
 than the rest of the network puts together.

31:55.460 --> 31:57.380
 And that's extremely expensive.

31:57.380 --> 32:00.420
 In proof of stake, instead of relying on people

32:00.420 --> 32:03.060
 with computers that are just constantly cranking out

32:03.060 --> 32:08.060
 hashes 24 seven, as you're like a unit of economic resources,

32:08.780 --> 32:11.700
 you just use like holdings of coins inside the system, right?

32:11.700 --> 32:12.780
 So all of these blockchains,

32:12.780 --> 32:14.460
 they have some kind of coin in them.

32:14.460 --> 32:17.380
 Bitcoin has Bitcoin, Ethereum has ether,

32:17.380 --> 32:18.260
 they all have a coin.

32:18.260 --> 32:22.940
 So why not just use that as the economic resource

32:22.940 --> 32:25.860
 that you're using to measure participation.

32:25.860 --> 32:29.220
 So that's like the core distinction

32:29.220 --> 32:31.900
 between proof of work and proof of stake.

32:31.900 --> 32:32.940
 I like proof of stake

32:32.940 --> 32:35.380
 and I've liked proof of stake for many years,

32:35.380 --> 32:38.260
 basically because like it just requires

32:38.260 --> 32:41.260
 much less ongoing resource consumption, right?

32:41.260 --> 32:42.820
 Like with proof of work,

32:42.820 --> 32:45.700
 you have to like actually go and buy these physical computers

32:45.700 --> 32:49.180
 and these days, they have specialized hardware,

32:49.180 --> 32:51.940
 ASICs, application specific integrated circuits.

32:51.940 --> 32:54.140
 You have to go produce them and you have to go buy them.

32:54.140 --> 32:56.660
 And unless you have millions of dollars,

32:56.660 --> 32:58.500
 you have to buy them from one of these other people

32:58.500 --> 33:01.300
 who creates them and those other people often end up

33:01.300 --> 33:03.660
 taking a huge cut of the profits themselves.

33:03.660 --> 33:06.860
 And then you have to plug them in,

33:06.860 --> 33:09.820
 you have to just burn all of this electricity

33:09.820 --> 33:11.820
 that's just running 24 seven.

33:11.820 --> 33:14.300
 So it consumes a huge amount of energy, right?

33:14.300 --> 33:17.060
 And not just energy, it also,

33:17.060 --> 33:19.060
 just to create the hardware, right?

33:19.060 --> 33:20.620
 Like people focus a lot on energy,

33:20.620 --> 33:23.500
 but like actually about half the cost of proof of work

33:23.500 --> 33:25.380
 mining is the cost of the hardware.

33:25.380 --> 33:28.060
 So hardware is a very big deal too.

33:28.060 --> 33:32.060
 And you need this really big and powerful,

33:32.060 --> 33:33.340
 very specialized hardware,

33:33.340 --> 33:35.620
 another kind that fills up these big warehouses.

33:35.620 --> 33:36.620
 So proof of stake,

33:36.620 --> 33:38.980
 you don't really need that much electricity,

33:38.980 --> 33:42.980
 you just need just a little bit to run a regular computer.

33:42.980 --> 33:45.340
 You can run proof of stake validators on computers

33:45.340 --> 33:47.220
 that you already have.

33:47.220 --> 33:52.100
 So it's just much less resource intensive.

33:52.100 --> 33:53.900
 And like, this is good for a few reasons, right?

33:53.900 --> 33:55.020
 Like one is, you know,

33:55.020 --> 33:57.380
 the kind of environmental rationale that, you know,

33:57.380 --> 33:59.500
 you're not breaking the environment.

33:59.500 --> 34:03.540
 The second is that you're not taking away electricity

34:03.540 --> 34:06.060
 and like other resources from other people.

34:06.060 --> 34:07.860
 I mean, like right now there's,

34:07.860 --> 34:10.620
 I think just today I saw a story about like Iran

34:10.620 --> 34:12.580
 wanting to shut down some Bitcoin mining

34:12.580 --> 34:15.220
 because it was just grabbing up so much electricity

34:15.220 --> 34:17.300
 that it was, you know, outbidding the nearby towns

34:17.300 --> 34:19.740
 and they just didn't have enough.

34:19.740 --> 34:22.140
 And then there was like Chia,

34:22.140 --> 34:24.700
 the one that's doing proof of like hard disk mining

34:24.700 --> 34:27.060
 basically is just like grabbing up so many hard disks,

34:27.060 --> 34:28.940
 there's a shortage, right?

34:28.940 --> 34:29.900
 So that's the second reason.

34:29.900 --> 34:32.540
 And then the third more selfish reason is that

34:32.540 --> 34:34.660
 because participating in consensus

34:34.660 --> 34:37.580
 does not require so much energy expenditure,

34:37.580 --> 34:40.660
 you don't need to pay people as much to participate, right?

34:40.660 --> 34:42.100
 So like Bitcoin and Ethereum,

34:42.100 --> 34:46.300
 they both issue somewhere around 4% of the total supply

34:46.300 --> 34:48.420
 every year right now to miners.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.820
 So Ethereum is about 4.7 million ether

34:50.820 --> 34:53.500
 and the current supply is about 115 million.

34:53.500 --> 34:54.460
 But with proof of stake,

34:54.460 --> 34:58.380
 like we expect it'll be somewhere between 500,000

34:58.380 --> 35:00.260
 and one million per year.

35:00.260 --> 35:02.900
 So that means, you know,

35:02.900 --> 35:06.860
 the supply doesn't have to increase so quickly.

35:06.860 --> 35:07.700
 So.

35:07.700 --> 35:12.340
 One of the pros that the people sort of argue for the proof

35:12.340 --> 35:14.820
 of work is that it is secure

35:14.820 --> 35:17.820
 because it's much more difficult to sort of,

35:17.820 --> 35:19.980
 as you've highlighted, it's difficult to participate.

35:19.980 --> 35:24.980
 Is there, what are your thoughts about the security

35:25.180 --> 35:28.980
 of the proof of stake mechanism?

35:28.980 --> 35:30.700
 Is there ways to make it secure?

35:30.700 --> 35:32.660
 So I think proof of stake is very secure

35:32.660 --> 35:36.540
 because in order to be able to attack the system,

35:36.540 --> 35:39.220
 you needs to have like basically as much stake

35:39.220 --> 35:41.220
 as the rest of the network, right?

35:41.220 --> 35:43.100
 So that means like right now, for example,

35:43.100 --> 35:44.620
 we have 5 million eth staking.

35:44.620 --> 35:46.260
 So you have to come up with 5 million eth

35:46.260 --> 35:47.620
 and then join the network.

35:47.620 --> 35:51.980
 And then the other, so 5 million eth is a lot, right?

35:51.980 --> 35:53.700
 It's like, how much is it now?

35:53.700 --> 35:55.220
 Like $15 billion.

35:55.220 --> 35:58.260
 So that's actually more than I believe the cost

35:58.260 --> 36:00.420
 of attacking the Bitcoin network.

36:00.420 --> 36:03.020
 And then the second thing is that recovering

36:03.020 --> 36:04.980
 from attacks is much easier in proof of stake

36:04.980 --> 36:05.940
 than in proof of work, right?

36:05.940 --> 36:08.980
 Because in proof of stake, you have, like, first of all,

36:08.980 --> 36:10.660
 we have for many kinds of attacks

36:10.660 --> 36:12.140
 that you do against this network,

36:12.140 --> 36:14.660
 we have this concept of like automatic slashing, right?

36:14.660 --> 36:16.700
 Which basically means that in order

36:16.700 --> 36:19.340
 to like revert a finalized block,

36:19.340 --> 36:22.180
 so if there's one block that's like accepted by the network

36:22.180 --> 36:23.940
 and you try to convince the network

36:23.940 --> 36:26.940
 to kind of revert that block and accept a different block,

36:26.940 --> 36:28.820
 in order to make that kind of attack,

36:28.820 --> 36:31.940
 you basically have to have your validator,

36:31.940 --> 36:33.540
 like a big portion of your validator

36:33.540 --> 36:35.980
 assigned to conflicting messages.

36:35.980 --> 36:38.380
 And this is something that like once these messages

36:38.380 --> 36:39.940
 are on the network, like you can go and prove,

36:39.940 --> 36:41.340
 like, look, these people did it.

36:41.340 --> 36:43.940
 And so we have this feature in the protocol called slashing

36:43.940 --> 36:45.820
 where you basically take all these people

36:45.820 --> 36:48.780
 who provably misbehaved and you burn their coins, right?

36:48.780 --> 36:50.780
 And you don't burn anyone else's coins.

36:50.780 --> 36:53.660
 Now, there are other cases, like for example,

36:53.660 --> 36:55.500
 if instead of reverting blocks,

36:55.500 --> 36:57.740
 the attack just tries to censor everyone, right?

36:57.740 --> 37:01.020
 Then everyone who got censored would just like

37:01.020 --> 37:02.980
 basically create the minority chain

37:02.980 --> 37:05.340
 and then the community would basically

37:05.340 --> 37:06.500
 have to do a soft fork, right?

37:06.500 --> 37:07.460
 They would just have to say like,

37:07.460 --> 37:09.060
 look, this chain is clearly attacking us,

37:09.060 --> 37:10.780
 this chain is the one not attacking us,

37:10.780 --> 37:12.340
 and so we're gonna join this chain.

37:12.340 --> 37:15.140
 And then what happens is that on that new chain,

37:15.140 --> 37:17.580
 the attackers also lose a lot of coins, right?

37:17.580 --> 37:20.660
 So the difference between proof of stake and proof of work

37:20.660 --> 37:22.260
 is that in a proof of stake system,

37:22.260 --> 37:24.660
 like you can identify specific participants

37:24.660 --> 37:26.540
 and you can say, you know, these,

37:26.540 --> 37:27.980
 and like this isn't like, you know,

37:27.980 --> 37:29.620
 a human going in and saying, I don't like you,

37:29.620 --> 37:30.580
 I don't like you, I don't like you,

37:30.580 --> 37:32.300
 this is like automated, right?

37:32.300 --> 37:34.660
 So the slashing process is automated.

37:34.660 --> 37:35.500
 Yes.

37:35.500 --> 37:37.420
 Is there ways it can go wrong?

37:37.420 --> 37:40.260
 So that's a painful process where the coins are burned.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.540
 It is painful, yes.

37:42.540 --> 37:45.940
 I think, I mean, the one big unknown, of course,

37:45.940 --> 37:48.540
 is like if an attack actually happens

37:48.540 --> 37:51.340
 and like if an attack happens that requires the community

37:51.340 --> 37:53.780
 to actually choose one of these minority forks,

37:53.780 --> 37:57.120
 then like what would the community

37:57.120 --> 37:59.980
 actually successfully coordinating on this look like, right?

37:59.980 --> 38:03.220
 Like it's like, you know, we can talk about it

38:03.220 --> 38:05.940
 and we can, you know, write like science fiction novels

38:05.940 --> 38:07.900
 about it, but like until it's happened,

38:07.900 --> 38:09.980
 you don't really know the details of like what it looks like

38:09.980 --> 38:11.020
 and how difficult it is.

38:11.020 --> 38:13.540
 What are the channels of communication for the community?

38:13.540 --> 38:18.020
 If you can enlighten me a little bit, like what, you know,

38:18.020 --> 38:19.980
 in many ways in the political realm,

38:19.980 --> 38:22.540
 Twitter is often used as a way to kind of have

38:22.540 --> 38:25.400
 these emerging phenomena of large groups of people

38:25.400 --> 38:28.300
 coming to a consensus about a particular idea.

38:28.300 --> 38:30.340
 And then there's battle for consensus.

38:30.340 --> 38:35.140
 What's in the Ethereum community, how do people,

38:35.140 --> 38:39.380
 what are the sources of natural language based communication

38:39.380 --> 38:42.980
 that have an emergent belief structure that you would say?

38:43.940 --> 38:45.340
 Or is it all through money?

38:45.340 --> 38:48.100
 Is it all through trading that the communication happens?

38:48.100 --> 38:50.140
 There's definitely talking as well.

38:50.140 --> 38:53.420
 I mean, like we have to agree on protocol changes somehow,

38:53.420 --> 38:55.380
 right, like there's Twitter, there's Reddit,

38:55.380 --> 39:00.380
 there's GitHub, there's all of the various Ethereum forums,

39:00.500 --> 39:02.780
 Ethereum magicians, Ethereum research.

39:02.780 --> 39:05.020
 There's just in person communication.

39:05.020 --> 39:06.860
 Then there's just kind of like the hidden web

39:06.860 --> 39:11.220
 of everyone talking to everyone on Telegram or Signal.

39:11.220 --> 39:14.020
 So it's like some of everything, right?

39:14.020 --> 39:17.540
 But I think like the thing to emphasize around like,

39:17.540 --> 39:19.660
 can you actually come to consensus on, you know,

39:19.660 --> 39:21.500
 whether or not to fork the chain

39:21.500 --> 39:23.520
 because the attacker is censoring everyone,

39:23.520 --> 39:27.820
 just for example, is like everyone who's running a node

39:27.820 --> 39:30.380
 is going to see almost the same thing, right?

39:30.380 --> 39:32.440
 Like they're gonna be off by a few seconds

39:32.440 --> 39:34.140
 and like maybe they'll be off by a few minutes,

39:34.140 --> 39:35.460
 they'll disagree by a few minutes.

39:35.460 --> 39:37.680
 But like if it's a serious attack, you know,

39:37.680 --> 39:38.780
 people are gonna know, right?

39:38.780 --> 39:40.900
 It's not like one of those things where, you know,

39:40.900 --> 39:43.900
 oh, we're trying to agree on like, I don't know,

39:43.900 --> 39:48.100
 did Epstein kill himself or like some random political fact

39:48.100 --> 39:50.060
 where like in reality, no one knows a single thing

39:50.060 --> 39:52.580
 about what's actually going on and they're all speculating.

39:52.580 --> 39:54.340
 Like it is much more visible, right?

39:54.340 --> 39:57.300
 So we do have that, but you know, at the same time,

39:57.300 --> 39:59.160
 I'm happy to admit that like,

39:59.160 --> 40:02.080
 these are fairly untested mechanisms,

40:02.080 --> 40:03.340
 but like at the same time,

40:03.340 --> 40:05.820
 they're also untested mechanisms in Proof of Work, right?

40:05.820 --> 40:07.460
 And like in Proof of Work, it's even harder

40:07.460 --> 40:09.940
 because in Proof of Work, you don't have the ability

40:09.940 --> 40:12.260
 to like identify and say, like, you know,

40:12.260 --> 40:14.300
 I'm going to these miners attacked

40:14.300 --> 40:17.180
 and so we're not gonna let these miners in,

40:17.180 --> 40:20.220
 these miners did not attack, so we're gonna keep them in.

40:20.220 --> 40:21.500
 Like you have to pretty much, you know,

40:21.500 --> 40:23.740
 either take out none of the miners

40:23.740 --> 40:26.460
 or you do a fork that changes the Proof of Work algorithm

40:26.460 --> 40:28.020
 which takes out all of the miners, right?

40:28.020 --> 40:32.140
 So the economics of like recovering from attacks

40:32.140 --> 40:33.540
 in Proof of Work, at least to me,

40:33.540 --> 40:36.960
 actually do seem like more unfavorable,

40:36.960 --> 40:39.740
 but you know, I'm sure the Proof of Work people you talk to

40:39.740 --> 40:42.460
 will give a very different and contradictory opinions

40:42.460 --> 40:44.620
 and that's totally fine and amazing.

40:44.620 --> 40:48.740
 Some people describe MEV, minor extractable value,

40:48.740 --> 40:51.680
 as an existential risk to Ethereum.

40:51.680 --> 40:52.820
 What is MEV?

40:52.820 --> 40:55.020
 How important is it to solve MEV?

40:55.020 --> 40:57.180
 If it's important, what ideas do you have?

40:57.180 --> 40:58.760
 Sure, how about after this one,

40:58.760 --> 41:01.060
 we'll also talk about sharding because it's amazing

41:01.060 --> 41:01.900
 and it's part of you too.

41:01.900 --> 41:03.660
 Yes, we'll return back to sharding

41:03.660 --> 41:06.060
 which is, we'll return to the big picture

41:06.060 --> 41:07.980
 of the scaling problem as you mentioned.

41:07.980 --> 41:09.740
 I love this conversation, you know,

41:09.740 --> 41:11.740
 depth first search instead of breadth first.

41:11.740 --> 41:16.740
 So basically, okay, MEV, minor extractable value,

41:16.740 --> 41:19.160
 it is not different in Proof of Work and Proof of Stake,

41:19.160 --> 41:21.120
 right, so like if you want to call it, you know,

41:21.120 --> 41:22.880
 block proposer extractable value,

41:22.880 --> 41:24.280
 like it sounds a lot sexy, but you know,

41:24.280 --> 41:27.360
 we can call it BPEV instead of MEV, who cares?

41:27.360 --> 41:30.040
 So this is a problem in both Proof of Work

41:30.040 --> 41:30.880
 and Proof of Stake?

41:30.880 --> 41:35.880
 Yes, so the basic idea is that if you have the ability

41:36.960 --> 41:39.800
 to choose which transactions go into a block

41:39.800 --> 41:42.720
 and in what order, then you have the ability

41:42.720 --> 41:45.720
 to like take advantage of that position for economic gain

41:45.720 --> 41:48.000
 and for economic gain in a lot more ways

41:48.000 --> 41:50.080
 than just collecting transaction fees, right?

41:50.080 --> 41:52.880
 Like for example, there's decentralized exchanges on chain

41:52.880 --> 41:56.020
 like Uniswap and like let's say the price

41:56.020 --> 42:01.020
 of ETH versus USDC was 2,700 the previous block,

42:01.960 --> 42:03.480
 but then there was a bit of a market drop

42:03.480 --> 42:05.960
 and now it's 2,680 where you can go on Uniswap

42:05.960 --> 42:09.060
 and you can just like gobble up the entire part of,

42:09.060 --> 42:10.960
 you know, the automated order book

42:10.960 --> 42:13.520
 that's like between 2,700 and 2,680, right?

42:13.520 --> 42:16.640
 And that's, and then at the same time, you like run a bot

42:16.640 --> 42:19.480
 and you know, you buy some ETH back at 2,680

42:19.480 --> 42:21.760
 and you've just like made about $10 of profit, right?

42:21.760 --> 42:25.120
 So, or well, $10 times, you know, whatever the depth is.

42:25.120 --> 42:28.520
 Right, so there's lots of little things like that.

42:28.520 --> 42:31.560
 There's also things that involve like front running

42:31.560 --> 42:33.240
 other people's transactions.

42:33.240 --> 42:37.060
 So one example of this would be that if someone sends

42:37.060 --> 42:39.920
 a transaction that says, I don't know,

42:39.920 --> 42:44.920
 buy me five ETH for whatever price that you can get,

42:45.760 --> 42:50.760
 then, but with a maximum of, let's say $15,000,

42:50.920 --> 42:53.680
 then you can go and like, you can send each,

42:53.680 --> 42:55.800
 put a transaction right in front of that transaction

42:55.800 --> 42:57.600
 and you can like buy up that ETH first

42:57.600 --> 42:59.120
 and then you resell it to him at, you know,

42:59.120 --> 43:00.920
 $15,000 minus one, you know?

43:00.920 --> 43:02.480
 So there's.

43:02.480 --> 43:03.880
 Then you get to make a little bit of money that way.

43:03.880 --> 43:05.600
 Exactly, so there's a lot of these different

43:05.600 --> 43:07.360
 like arbitrage, front running, back running,

43:07.360 --> 43:11.120
 these different tricks that allow block proposers to.

43:11.120 --> 43:13.560
 To get some percentage on top, like overhead.

43:13.560 --> 43:17.480
 Exactly, and the reason why this is a challenge

43:17.480 --> 43:21.680
 is because it's, I mean, like first of all,

43:21.680 --> 43:24.340
 it sometimes degrades user experience

43:24.340 --> 43:27.440
 because users get no less favorable trades,

43:27.440 --> 43:30.560
 but there are sometimes ways to like mitigate that

43:30.560 --> 43:32.960
 for applications, sometimes it's not that bad,

43:32.960 --> 43:35.800
 but like the bigger risk that I think some people consider

43:35.800 --> 43:38.960
 more existential is that there's just much more

43:38.960 --> 43:41.080
 economies of scale in figuring out

43:41.080 --> 43:43.020
 how to extract all this revenue, right?

43:43.020 --> 43:45.200
 Because if you're just collecting transaction fees,

43:45.200 --> 43:47.400
 there aren't really economies of scale,

43:47.400 --> 43:49.240
 there aren't really benefits to centralizing, right?

43:49.240 --> 43:50.600
 Because it's a very simple formula,

43:50.600 --> 43:53.320
 you just like grab up the transactions that pay you the most.

43:53.320 --> 43:57.760
 But with MEV, there's all these sophisticated algorithms

43:57.760 --> 43:59.940
 and if you have lots of money,

43:59.940 --> 44:01.400
 then you can hire really smart people

44:01.400 --> 44:03.160
 to make amazing algorithms and then you can use

44:03.160 --> 44:06.080
 the other half of your money to get a lot of mining power

44:06.080 --> 44:08.160
 or a lot of stake and you get a lot of opportunities

44:08.160 --> 44:09.940
 to use your even better algorithms.

44:09.940 --> 44:14.480
 So there's this risk that like as a result of this,

44:14.480 --> 44:18.600
 mining is basically, or even validating proof of stake

44:18.600 --> 44:19.760
 is going to centralize.

44:20.860 --> 44:23.920
 So I think the ecosystem is best replied

44:23.920 --> 44:25.840
 to this sort of risk and it's the direction

44:25.840 --> 44:28.880
 where projects like Flashbots are going already

44:28.880 --> 44:33.500
 is if you can't eliminate the centralization,

44:33.500 --> 44:35.200
 then you try to firewall it, right?

44:35.200 --> 44:39.080
 And the way that you firewall it is you basically say,

44:39.080 --> 44:42.000
 we're going to try to deliberately create a marketplace

44:42.000 --> 44:45.320
 where people can just do the complicated work

44:45.320 --> 44:47.080
 of creating what are called bundles,

44:47.080 --> 44:51.880
 like bundles of transactions that are very profitable, right?

44:51.880 --> 44:54.200
 And then at the other side of the market,

44:54.200 --> 44:56.600
 you just have like block proposes reminders

44:56.600 --> 44:57.760
 that are just dumb notes.

44:57.760 --> 45:00.840
 And they go and ask the what are called searchers,

45:00.840 --> 45:02.800
 the bundle creators, and they just ask like,

45:02.800 --> 45:05.560
 hey, like how much can you give me if I put in your bundle?

45:05.560 --> 45:07.560
 And then they just take the highest offer, right?

45:07.560 --> 45:09.360
 So you sort of separate out the task

45:09.360 --> 45:12.640
 and you have the easy part and then you have the hard part

45:12.640 --> 45:14.580
 and you have like this special class of actor

45:14.580 --> 45:16.080
 called a searcher that does the hard part

45:16.080 --> 45:19.440
 and then the easy part, the people doing the easy part,

45:19.440 --> 45:20.720
 which is just miners and validators,

45:20.720 --> 45:24.540
 they kind of just talk to all the different people

45:24.540 --> 45:27.720
 doing the searching and they just accept the highest bidder.

45:27.720 --> 45:32.720
 So this is also just like an interesting example

45:33.160 --> 45:35.240
 of like economic design philosophy, right?

45:35.240 --> 45:38.320
 Like sometimes you can't just like make centralization

45:38.320 --> 45:39.860
 go away, sometimes it's inevitable,

45:39.860 --> 45:43.200
 but no, at least you can try to kind of contain it,

45:43.200 --> 45:47.340
 you can direct it or you can even sort of firewall it away

45:47.340 --> 45:49.280
 from core consensus,

45:49.280 --> 45:51.960
 the parts that really do need to be decentralized.

45:51.960 --> 45:53.760
 But you don't see it as an existential risk,

45:53.760 --> 45:56.280
 it's just a bit of a problem

45:56.280 --> 45:57.960
 that it has to be constantly dealt with.

45:57.960 --> 46:00.960
 It's a risk, like there's obviously a risk

46:00.960 --> 46:04.080
 that it's a very severe problem

46:04.080 --> 46:06.040
 and that even this flash bots approach

46:06.040 --> 46:08.120
 has some fatal flaw or whatever.

46:08.120 --> 46:12.080
 But we're definitely approaching it

46:12.080 --> 46:14.340
 with the mindset of this is a problem

46:14.340 --> 46:16.400
 and like, yes, we do have to do some work to solve it,

46:16.400 --> 46:20.220
 but we're doing it and so far it's being solved.

46:20.220 --> 46:23.360
 Okay, let's talk about the other really, really fascinating

46:23.360 --> 46:26.720
 part of the future of Ethereum.

46:26.720 --> 46:28.880
 Let's not call it Ethereum 2.0,

46:28.880 --> 46:30.440
 but the future of Ethereum

46:30.440 --> 46:32.580
 that also may require a hard fork,

46:32.580 --> 46:34.920
 I don't know, you can correct me on this,

46:34.920 --> 46:39.640
 is well, broadly ideas for scaling.

46:39.640 --> 46:40.480
 Yes.

46:40.480 --> 46:44.000
 And more specifically sort of layer two

46:44.000 --> 46:48.440
 or layer one and two intersection ideas

46:48.440 --> 46:50.000
 of how to achieve scaling.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.680
 And at the core of that is the idea of sharding.

46:52.680 --> 46:55.240
 So first, what is sharding?

46:55.240 --> 46:59.720
 Okay, so there's two major paradigms

46:59.720 --> 47:01.000
 for scaling blockchains, right?

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
 As you said, layer one and layer two.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.160
 And layer one basically means

47:05.160 --> 47:07.940
 make the blockchain itself capable

47:07.940 --> 47:09.840
 of processing more transactions

47:09.840 --> 47:13.600
 by having some mechanism by which it can do that

47:13.600 --> 47:15.600
 despite the fact that there's a limit

47:15.600 --> 47:18.040
 to the capacity of each participant in the blockchain.

47:18.040 --> 47:19.080
 And then layer two says,

47:19.080 --> 47:21.300
 well, we're gonna keep the blockchain as is,

47:21.300 --> 47:23.840
 but we're gonna create clever protocols

47:23.840 --> 47:25.500
 that sit on top of the blockchain

47:25.500 --> 47:26.920
 that still use the blockchain

47:26.920 --> 47:28.720
 and then still kind of inherit things

47:28.720 --> 47:31.000
 like the security guarantees of a blockchain.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.840
 But at the same time, a lot of things are done off chain.

47:33.840 --> 47:36.660
 And so you get more scalability that way.

47:36.660 --> 47:39.720
 So in Ethereum, the most popular paradigm

47:39.720 --> 47:40.920
 for layer two is rollups

47:40.920 --> 47:43.280
 and the most popular paradigm for layer one is sharding.

47:43.280 --> 47:46.240
 So one way to achieve layer one scaling

47:46.240 --> 47:48.080
 is to increase the block size.

47:48.080 --> 47:48.920
 Yes.

47:48.920 --> 47:51.880
 Block size wars, quote, unquote.

47:51.880 --> 47:54.220
 And you actually tweeted something about,

47:55.800 --> 47:58.520
 people are saying that Vitalik changed his mind about,

47:58.520 --> 48:03.520
 he went from being a small blocker to a big to small.

48:05.880 --> 48:09.320
 But you said, I've been a medium blocker all along.

48:09.320 --> 48:11.760
 So maybe you can also comment on where,

48:11.760 --> 48:14.840
 on the very basic aspect before we even get to sharding

48:14.840 --> 48:17.400
 of where you stand on this block size debate.

48:17.400 --> 48:18.240
 Sure.

48:18.240 --> 48:20.080
 So the way that I think about the trade off

48:20.080 --> 48:21.580
 is I think about it as a trade off

48:21.580 --> 48:24.200
 between making it easy to write to the blockchain

48:24.200 --> 48:26.440
 and making it easy to read the blockchain.

48:26.440 --> 48:28.480
 So when I say read, I just mean,

48:28.480 --> 48:30.160
 have a node and actually verify it

48:30.160 --> 48:32.280
 and make sure that it's correct and all of those things.

48:32.280 --> 48:34.680
 And then by write, I mean send transactions.

48:34.680 --> 48:37.240
 So I think for decentralization,

48:37.240 --> 48:40.220
 it's important for both of these tasks to be accessible.

48:40.220 --> 48:43.040
 And I think that they're about equally importance.

48:43.040 --> 48:45.120
 If you have a chain that's too expensive to read,

48:45.120 --> 48:46.800
 then everyone will just trust a few people

48:46.800 --> 48:48.360
 to read for them.

48:48.360 --> 48:49.920
 And then those people can change the rules

48:49.920 --> 48:51.680
 without anyone else's permission.

48:51.680 --> 48:53.360
 But if on the other hand,

48:53.360 --> 48:55.200
 it becomes really expensive to write,

48:55.200 --> 48:58.680
 then everyone will move on to basically

48:58.680 --> 49:01.640
 second layer systems that are incredibly centralized.

49:01.640 --> 49:04.660
 And that takes away from decentralization

49:04.660 --> 49:06.380
 and self sovereignty as well.

49:06.380 --> 49:08.280
 So this has been my viewpoints

49:08.280 --> 49:09.440
 pretty much the whole time, right?

49:09.440 --> 49:11.000
 It's like, you need this balance

49:11.000 --> 49:12.760
 and going in one direction or the other direction

49:12.760 --> 49:14.340
 is very unhealthy.

49:14.340 --> 49:16.680
 In the Bitcoin case, basically what happened

49:16.680 --> 49:19.720
 was that Bitcoin originally,

49:19.720 --> 49:22.100
 at the very beginning, it didn't really have a block size.

49:22.100 --> 49:25.040
 It just had an accidental block size of 32 meg,

49:25.040 --> 49:27.200
 or block size limit of 32 megabytes

49:27.200 --> 49:29.360
 because that just happens to be the limit

49:29.360 --> 49:31.360
 of the peer to peer messages.

49:31.360 --> 49:32.200
 But then...

49:32.200 --> 49:33.580
 Interesting, I didn't even know that part.

49:33.580 --> 49:36.800
 Yeah, but then Satoshi back in 2010

49:36.800 --> 49:38.760
 was worried that even 32 megabyte blocks

49:38.760 --> 49:39.880
 would be too hard to process.

49:39.880 --> 49:42.600
 So he put the limit down to one megabyte.

49:42.600 --> 49:44.920
 And I think the...

49:44.920 --> 49:47.240
 I put, you mean sneaked in there.

49:47.240 --> 49:49.960
 Yeah, just like made an update to the Bitcoin software

49:49.960 --> 49:51.480
 that made blocks bigger than one,

49:51.480 --> 49:54.240
 I think it's a million bytes invalid.

49:54.240 --> 49:58.420
 And I think the impression that most people had at the time

49:58.420 --> 50:01.380
 is that this is just a temporary safety measure.

50:01.380 --> 50:05.880
 And over time, as we become more confident in the software,

50:05.880 --> 50:10.760
 that limit would be raised somewhat.

50:10.760 --> 50:15.760
 But then when the actual usage of the blockchain

50:16.320 --> 50:19.000
 started going up, and then it started going up

50:19.000 --> 50:21.200
 first to 100 kilobytes per block,

50:21.200 --> 50:22.640
 then to 250 kilobytes per block,

50:22.640 --> 50:25.080
 then to 500 kilobytes per block,

50:25.080 --> 50:28.480
 there started coming out of the woodworks this opinion

50:28.480 --> 50:31.120
 that no, that limit should just not be increased.

50:31.120 --> 50:36.120
 And then there are all of these attempts at compromising.

50:36.120 --> 50:40.960
 First, there was a proposal for 20 megabyte blocks.

50:40.960 --> 50:43.120
 Then there was the 248 proposal,

50:43.120 --> 50:46.180
 which is a bit ironic because the 248 proposal

50:46.180 --> 50:49.480
 started off being a small block negotiating position.

50:49.480 --> 50:52.040
 But then when the big block people came back and said,

50:52.040 --> 50:53.680
 hey, aren't we gonna do this?

50:53.680 --> 50:55.040
 They're like, oh, no, no, no, we don't want them.

50:55.040 --> 50:57.920
 We don't want the block size increases anymore.

50:57.920 --> 51:01.600
 So there were these two different positions,

51:01.600 --> 51:02.680
 the small blockers.

51:02.680 --> 51:06.080
 I think they valued one megabyte blocks for two reasons.

51:06.080 --> 51:08.360
 One is that they just really, really believe

51:08.360 --> 51:10.980
 in the importance of being able to read the chain.

51:10.980 --> 51:14.360
 But two is that a lot of them really believe

51:14.360 --> 51:18.560
 in maintaining this norm of never hard forking, right?

51:18.560 --> 51:21.200
 So the difference between a hard fork and a soft fork

51:21.200 --> 51:24.000
 is basically that in a soft fork,

51:26.360 --> 51:28.240
 any block that's valid under the new rules

51:28.240 --> 51:30.040
 was still valid under the old rules.

51:30.040 --> 51:31.740
 So if you have a client that verifies

51:31.740 --> 51:33.000
 according to the old rules,

51:33.000 --> 51:35.440
 then you'll still be able to accept the chain

51:35.440 --> 51:37.360
 that follows the new rules.

51:37.360 --> 51:38.720
 Whereas with a hard fork,

51:38.720 --> 51:42.140
 you have to update your code in order to stay on the chain.

51:43.160 --> 51:48.080
 And look, they have this belief that soft forks

51:48.080 --> 51:51.040
 are kind of either less coercive than hard forks,

51:51.040 --> 51:53.400
 which by the way, I completely disagree with.

51:53.400 --> 51:55.320
 I actually think soft forks are more coercive

51:55.320 --> 51:57.720
 because basically they force everyone who disagrees

51:57.720 --> 51:59.320
 to sort of go along by default.

51:59.320 --> 52:04.320
 But, or they have this opinion that there's like,

52:06.760 --> 52:09.680
 it's more difficult to abuse soft forks

52:09.680 --> 52:11.040
 to do really mean things like,

52:11.040 --> 52:13.560
 or that like completely violate people's expectations,

52:13.560 --> 52:16.240
 like increasing the supply, which is like,

52:16.240 --> 52:18.840
 I think there is some truth to that.

52:18.840 --> 52:20.560
 So because of these reasons,

52:20.560 --> 52:22.440
 they just say we're only going to do soft forks

52:22.440 --> 52:25.500
 and we want to just not do any hard forks.

52:25.500 --> 52:27.880
 And they eventually discovered this idea

52:27.880 --> 52:29.720
 called segregated witness that allows for like

52:29.720 --> 52:31.880
 a very tiny block size increase

52:31.880 --> 52:34.880
 to like the equivalent of about two megabytes

52:34.880 --> 52:36.160
 with a soft fork.

52:36.160 --> 52:41.160
 It's this really like weird and devious trick.

52:41.840 --> 52:45.080
 Like basically what they do is they take the signatures

52:45.080 --> 52:48.160
 of transactions and then they put them outside of the block.

52:48.160 --> 52:51.240
 And then they add an extra rule that says that like every,

52:51.240 --> 52:52.400
 for a block to be valid,

52:52.400 --> 52:54.440
 the block has to come with a separate,

52:54.440 --> 52:56.000
 like basically extension block

52:56.000 --> 52:58.840
 that contains all of the transaction signatures, right?

52:58.840 --> 53:01.140
 So when you measure it, according to the old rules,

53:01.140 --> 53:02.840
 like, hey, it adds up to less than a million,

53:02.840 --> 53:04.500
 but actually there's this extension block

53:04.500 --> 53:06.960
 that the old protocol doesn't even know about.

53:06.960 --> 53:07.800
 So.

53:07.800 --> 53:10.600
 It's a hack that seemed to work to in a small way

53:10.600 --> 53:12.200
 extend the size of the block size.

53:12.200 --> 53:14.560
 So the small block side was like happy

53:14.560 --> 53:16.120
 with these very low levels of block size.

53:16.120 --> 53:19.360
 And then the big block side wanted to expand to,

53:19.360 --> 53:21.080
 at the very least go to four megabytes,

53:21.080 --> 53:23.280
 then maybe go maybe eight, 20.

53:23.280 --> 53:26.520
 There's disagreements within there as well.

53:26.520 --> 53:29.960
 I definitely was favoring the big side

53:29.960 --> 53:33.960
 the whole way through, as you can probably tell, but.

53:33.960 --> 53:36.960
 Even though, so the argument against the big

53:36.960 --> 53:40.920
 is that it makes things more centralized.

53:40.920 --> 53:43.080
 Yes, because fewer people can run a note

53:43.080 --> 53:44.280
 that verifies the chain.

53:44.280 --> 53:46.200
 And also because any of these things

53:46.200 --> 53:47.320
 would require a hard fork

53:47.320 --> 53:49.320
 and hard forks are inherently risky.

53:49.320 --> 53:51.800
 Do you think there's truth to that?

53:51.800 --> 53:52.760
 I'm pro hard fork.

53:52.760 --> 53:54.720
 I think hard forks are actually like

53:54.720 --> 53:57.440
 in a political economic sense,

53:57.440 --> 53:59.240
 they're better than soft forks.

53:59.240 --> 54:00.760
 Well, let's, okay, okay.

54:00.760 --> 54:05.020
 I think that's a beautiful principle as stated

54:05.020 --> 54:10.020
 that soft forks may be more coercive than hard forks.

54:10.680 --> 54:13.040
 This is not just about cryptocurrency.

54:13.040 --> 54:16.280
 This is about politics and life.

54:16.280 --> 54:17.100
 That's fascinating.

54:17.100 --> 54:20.320
 So you're okay with hard forks.

54:20.320 --> 54:23.480
 In fact, you think hard forks is the right way

54:23.480 --> 54:26.320
 to make changes because then everybody's forced

54:26.320 --> 54:27.720
 to make a decision.

54:27.720 --> 54:29.100
 Do you accept this change or not

54:29.100 --> 54:32.480
 as opposed to ideas being sneaked in behind the door

54:32.480 --> 54:34.840
 and that decision is forced on you?

54:34.840 --> 54:36.140
 Exactly, yeah.

54:36.140 --> 54:39.760
 Okay, so, but hard forks, some people say,

54:39.760 --> 54:42.240
 this is when they talk about sort of Ethereum,

54:42.240 --> 54:44.120
 is there's some aspect to a hard fork

54:44.120 --> 54:46.860
 where you're trying to upgrade a,

54:46.860 --> 54:49.440
 what is it, airplane while it's flying.

54:49.440 --> 54:50.760
 And.

54:50.760 --> 54:52.800
 I think soft forks are also upgrading an airplane

54:52.800 --> 54:53.640
 while it's flying.

54:53.640 --> 54:55.240
 But it's a smaller upgrades.

54:56.200 --> 54:58.680
 That's, there's some truth to that.

54:58.680 --> 55:03.680
 Like there's definitely a bit more risk of like a split

55:03.920 --> 55:07.200
 as a result of a hard fork than as a result of a soft fork.

55:07.200 --> 55:10.620
 And the split is highly undesirable, right?

55:10.620 --> 55:11.460
 Well, it depends.

55:11.460 --> 55:14.160
 Like if it's a split because of a bug, then that's horrible.

55:14.160 --> 55:16.680
 If it's a split as a result of political differences,

55:16.680 --> 55:19.760
 then I think like a split is better than, you know,

55:19.760 --> 55:23.240
 one side being forced to basically just like suck it up

55:23.240 --> 55:26.240
 and accept the majority position even if it really hates it.

55:27.200 --> 55:28.800
 Well, there's also political connections

55:28.800 --> 55:30.400
 throughout the history of the United States.

55:30.400 --> 55:33.120
 It's like sometimes groups of people

55:33.120 --> 55:35.680
 that strongly disagree with each other

55:35.680 --> 55:38.840
 should be forced to work it out.

55:38.840 --> 55:41.560
 Even if they, even when a split seems like an easy thing

55:41.560 --> 55:42.640
 in the short term.

55:42.640 --> 55:43.480
 It depends.

55:43.480 --> 55:46.000
 And I think like, well, for blockchains in particular,

55:46.000 --> 55:50.080
 the costs of people being able to like peacefully do their,

55:50.080 --> 55:52.280
 go off and do their own thing are much lower, right?

55:52.280 --> 55:54.240
 Like, you know, okay, if you have a country

55:54.240 --> 55:58.400
 and you have two groups, then like often enough,

55:58.400 --> 56:01.160
 like fighting out the new rules requires, you know,

56:01.160 --> 56:03.120
 a civil war requires everyone to move and so forth.

56:03.120 --> 56:05.040
 But no, on a blockchain, like, you know,

56:05.040 --> 56:06.740
 the costs are lower and so.

56:07.640 --> 56:09.880
 So if you were to look at the way things worked out

56:09.880 --> 56:13.000
 with the block size wars and there was a split,

56:13.000 --> 56:15.560
 what is it, Bitcoin Cash and all this?

56:15.560 --> 56:16.380
 In Bitcoin.

56:16.380 --> 56:17.220
 Yeah.

56:17.220 --> 56:21.640
 Would you, like you looking, putting on your historian hat,

56:21.640 --> 56:23.980
 you mentioned offline you like Dan Carlin.

56:23.980 --> 56:26.460
 So if Dan Carlin wanted to do an episode

56:26.460 --> 56:31.460
 on the block size wars, do you think it could've turned out

56:32.480 --> 56:36.140
 better or do you, are you okay with the way it turned out?

56:37.680 --> 56:40.860
 I'm definitely disappointed with what happens

56:40.860 --> 56:43.140
 with the block, with the big block side.

56:44.200 --> 56:46.960
 I think the source of my disappointment is that like,

56:46.960 --> 56:50.120
 one of the things that you notice when just looking at

56:50.120 --> 56:52.560
 like this political disagreements generally,

56:52.560 --> 56:55.440
 especially when you have environments where, you know,

56:55.440 --> 56:57.920
 they're authoritarian or like single party dominated

56:57.920 --> 57:00.280
 and then there's some opposition party

57:00.280 --> 57:03.420
 and the opposition often has like very legitimate grievances.

57:03.420 --> 57:05.680
 But at the same time, the thing you notice is that often

57:05.680 --> 57:07.200
 enough the opposition just sucks, right?

57:07.200 --> 57:10.280
 Like it just doesn't have, you know, political capacity.

57:10.280 --> 57:13.320
 It doesn't have like the ability to come up with policy

57:13.320 --> 57:17.720
 because it's entire culture is like designed around

57:17.720 --> 57:19.960
 resisting much more than it's designed around like,

57:19.960 --> 57:23.240
 you know, actually debating serious policy trade offs.

57:23.240 --> 57:27.200
 And I worry or I guess not so much worry

57:27.200 --> 57:28.280
 because it's already happened.

57:28.280 --> 57:31.920
 I unfortunately think that Bitcoin Cash ended up

57:31.920 --> 57:34.040
 being a victim of this, right?

57:34.040 --> 57:37.120
 Like first, no, there was a split with Bitcoin Cash.

57:37.120 --> 57:39.160
 And then of course, Craig Wright came in

57:39.160 --> 57:43.240
 and you know, Craig Wright was this basically scammer

57:43.240 --> 57:46.280
 who just keeps on pretending that he is Satoshi Nakamoto,

57:46.280 --> 57:47.920
 the inventor of Bitcoin.

57:47.920 --> 57:49.960
 Hey, Craig Wright's legal team, do you hear me?

57:49.960 --> 57:52.200
 Yes, I still think your client is a scammer.

57:52.200 --> 57:53.240
 So sue me.

57:53.240 --> 57:55.160
 This is definitely gonna be death for a search

57:55.160 --> 57:56.960
 because I gotta ask you about Craig.

57:56.960 --> 57:58.800
 I guess these people have been contacting me

57:58.800 --> 58:00.200
 and I'm trying to figure out like,

58:00.200 --> 58:02.520
 what is up with this human being?

58:02.520 --> 58:05.460
 So for people who don't know, there's somebody who is,

58:05.460 --> 58:09.920
 let's start this Satoshi Nakamoto, who is the creator

58:09.920 --> 58:11.720
 of Bitcoin, who's anonymous.

58:11.720 --> 58:14.760
 And actually most really big people

58:14.760 --> 58:19.760
 in the cryptocurrency space do not like yourself

58:20.120 --> 58:23.240
 and others do not dare claim that they are even

58:23.240 --> 58:25.200
 for fun Satoshi Nakamoto.

58:25.200 --> 58:27.320
 In fact, if Satoshi Nakamoto is still alive

58:27.320 --> 58:29.800
 and is like, if say you were Satoshi Nakamoto,

58:29.800 --> 58:32.000
 it seems like the thing he would do is probably

58:32.000 --> 58:35.760
 or she is trying to remain anonymous.

58:35.760 --> 58:39.320
 On the flip side of that, there's a guy named Craig Wright

58:39.320 --> 58:42.120
 who continually keeps claiming that he is in fact

58:42.120 --> 58:45.920
 Satoshi Nakamoto and keeps suing a lot of people.

58:45.920 --> 58:49.420
 So on him, if we could just linger on him,

58:49.420 --> 58:51.120
 what do you make of this character?

58:52.120 --> 58:54.420
 What are we supposed to make of this character?

58:54.420 --> 58:56.120
 Should he be ignored?

58:56.120 --> 58:58.700
 Is there any possible truth to his claims?

58:59.880 --> 59:01.120
 What do you make of him?

59:01.120 --> 59:03.600
 The analogy that's at the top of my head

59:03.600 --> 59:06.000
 will get a bit political, but that's fine.

59:06.000 --> 59:07.600
 You've had Michael Malice.

59:07.600 --> 59:10.160
 So I guess I view Craig Wright

59:10.160 --> 59:12.480
 as being kind of like a Donald Trump figure

59:12.480 --> 59:15.160
 in that he's not very intellectual,

59:15.160 --> 59:17.320
 but I think he gets a big audience

59:17.320 --> 59:22.320
 because he says things that play to the resentments

59:23.480 --> 59:25.080
 that people have and he says things

59:25.080 --> 59:27.840
 that people wants to hear.

59:27.840 --> 59:30.120
 Like in the wake of this block size war,

59:30.120 --> 59:32.640
 the big blockers did feel very disenchanted.

59:32.640 --> 59:35.360
 They felt that Bitcoin always had this vision

59:35.360 --> 59:37.000
 that we were supposed to just keep increasing

59:37.000 --> 59:39.200
 the block size and Bitcoin is peer to peer cash.

59:39.200 --> 59:40.520
 It says so in the white paper.

59:40.520 --> 59:43.480
 And then this elitist clique of core devs

59:43.480 --> 59:45.560
 just came in and said, no, no, no,

59:45.560 --> 59:47.720
 we're gonna impose this totally different vision.

59:47.720 --> 59:49.240
 And if you ever want your scalability,

59:49.240 --> 59:51.000
 you'll have to wait for us to create

59:51.000 --> 59:53.400
 this totally unproven fancy technology

59:53.400 --> 59:54.400
 called the lightning network

59:54.400 --> 59:56.920
 that works under completely different principles.

59:56.920 --> 59:58.440
 And they were very angry at this.

59:58.440 --> 1:00:01.880
 And I mean, I think a lot of that anger is justified,

1:00:01.880 --> 1:00:06.880
 but at the same time, when people are in that mental state,

1:00:07.520 --> 1:00:10.320
 like it's very easy for you to just kind of like latch on.

1:00:10.320 --> 1:00:13.720
 And if you find someone who expresses anger

1:00:13.720 --> 1:00:15.760
 at the same things that you're angry at,

1:00:15.760 --> 1:00:19.720
 and also like it seems like someone who's strong

1:00:19.720 --> 1:00:22.880
 and seems like someone who might be good to rally around,

1:00:22.880 --> 1:00:24.920
 it's very easy to just like get behind that.

1:00:24.920 --> 1:00:26.720
 But that extra part about it where he's

1:00:26.720 --> 1:00:29.480
 Satoshi Nakamura, I don't understand why that's necessary.

1:00:29.480 --> 1:00:33.200
 I think that's, he could have done it without that,

1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:36.720
 but that just, it's a marketing strategy.

1:00:36.720 --> 1:00:38.440
 Like it sort of gives him more salience.

1:00:38.440 --> 1:00:40.800
 Like there's other big block personalities, right?

1:00:40.800 --> 1:00:43.000
 Well, what's the difference with Craig Wright?

1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:45.800
 He's not just a big block personality,

1:00:45.800 --> 1:00:48.640
 he's potentially Satoshi.

1:00:48.640 --> 1:00:52.000
 And he did say all the big block things, right?

1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:53.560
 Like he talked about how,

1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:56.040
 oh, the concept of a fee market is fundamentally

1:00:56.040 --> 1:01:00.160
 like economically wrong and it should be a free market

1:01:00.160 --> 1:01:02.000
 and you should be able to have blocks as big as you want.

1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:03.560
 So like he repeated all the talking points.

1:01:03.560 --> 1:01:07.560
 And so a lot of people were kind of sucked into that, right?

1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:12.280
 And so he unfortunately was able to basically dominate

1:01:12.280 --> 1:01:15.240
 a big part of the Bitcoin cash community for a long time.

1:01:15.240 --> 1:01:18.520
 And then eventually, of course,

1:01:18.520 --> 1:01:20.960
 more and more people started to catch on.

1:01:20.960 --> 1:01:22.600
 He would just say technical things

1:01:22.600 --> 1:01:24.080
 that are completely wrong, right?

1:01:24.080 --> 1:01:27.720
 Like one example of this that I remember

1:01:27.720 --> 1:01:32.720
 is that he mixed up the concept of 256 bits

1:01:32.880 --> 1:01:36.360
 and two to the power of 256 bits, right?

1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:38.640
 So the difference is, it's like the difference

1:01:38.640 --> 1:01:42.640
 between 80 and the concept of 80 digit numbers, right?

1:01:42.640 --> 1:01:46.720
 And because of this, like he made this arguments

1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:50.520
 that said that Bitcoin's elliptic curve

1:01:50.520 --> 1:01:52.480
 is friendly to cryptographic pairings.

1:01:52.480 --> 1:01:54.440
 Like you don't have to understand what that is,

1:01:54.440 --> 1:01:55.560
 but if you want to know,

1:01:55.560 --> 1:01:58.280
 I have articles on both at Vitalik.ca.

1:01:58.280 --> 1:02:01.400
 But basically he made this like technical argument

1:02:01.400 --> 1:02:03.280
 that really hedged on this point.

1:02:03.280 --> 1:02:04.800
 And then when people pressed him on,

1:02:04.800 --> 1:02:06.960
 it was like, yes, but no, no, like what?

1:02:06.960 --> 1:02:09.520
 Look, exactly, the height is like what?

1:02:09.520 --> 1:02:11.160
 Two to the 256 bits.

1:02:11.160 --> 1:02:14.560
 That's a very tiny amount of information.

1:02:14.560 --> 1:02:17.000
 No, no, no, no, two to the 256 bits

1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.440
 is more than the amount of information in the universe.

1:02:19.440 --> 1:02:22.680
 And like he equivocated and kind of like preyed

1:02:22.680 --> 1:02:25.480
 on people's inability to understand

1:02:25.480 --> 1:02:26.640
 that mathematical nuance.

1:02:26.640 --> 1:02:27.840
 And I called him out.

1:02:27.840 --> 1:02:30.240
 And eventually I even called him out in person

1:02:30.240 --> 1:02:31.800
 at this conference in Seoul.

1:02:31.800 --> 1:02:34.600
 Like I just stood up and asked,

1:02:34.600 --> 1:02:36.800
 hey, conference organizer,

1:02:36.800 --> 1:02:39.480
 why are you letting this fraud speak at this conference?

1:02:39.480 --> 1:02:42.920
 And I remember even some big blockers at the time

1:02:42.920 --> 1:02:44.440
 getting angry at me.

1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:47.720
 But eventually they did get rid of him.

1:02:47.720 --> 1:02:50.760
 And then Craig, well, basically Craig Wright

1:02:50.760 --> 1:02:52.800
 was forced to split off

1:02:52.800 --> 1:02:54.680
 because the rest of the community refused

1:02:54.680 --> 1:02:56.800
 to accept some network change that he wanted.

1:02:56.800 --> 1:02:59.040
 And so then there was the BCH and BSP.

1:02:59.040 --> 1:03:00.960
 And then in the Bitcoin Cash community,

1:03:00.960 --> 1:03:02.640
 there was this drama of,

1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:04.880
 are they going to add a developer fund

1:03:04.880 --> 1:03:07.080
 where they redirect 12 and a half percent of the revenue

1:03:07.080 --> 1:03:08.640
 from the miners to the devs?

1:03:08.640 --> 1:03:11.320
 And according to the libertarian not aggression principle,

1:03:11.320 --> 1:03:12.720
 is this technically theft?

1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:17.720
 Like his understanding of the technical depths

1:03:18.200 --> 1:03:20.600
 of cryptocurrency was lacking in a way

1:03:20.600 --> 1:03:23.200
 that Satoshi Nakamoto certainly would not.

1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:24.080
 Yes, exactly.

1:03:24.080 --> 1:03:27.560
 But the point is that even after Craig Wright got expunged,

1:03:27.560 --> 1:03:30.440
 the Bitcoin Cash community kept having these disagreements.

1:03:30.440 --> 1:03:34.000
 And now after this development funds dispute,

1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:37.800
 there was a further split between Bitcoin Cash and ABC.

1:03:37.800 --> 1:03:41.560
 So the branch continues to extend.

1:03:41.560 --> 1:03:43.800
 So in that way, it's disappointing

1:03:43.800 --> 1:03:46.240
 to see those kinds of splitting that was never resolved.

1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:47.080
 It is.

1:03:47.080 --> 1:03:49.800
 I would have definitely like wanted to see more

1:03:49.800 --> 1:03:54.000
 of a kind of like the principled coin

1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.560
 with like tries to be Bitcoin,

1:03:56.560 --> 1:03:59.800
 but follows consistent big block values.

1:03:59.800 --> 1:04:03.600
 But I know maybe I should just like stop expecting projects

1:04:03.600 --> 1:04:06.160
 that I have no involvement in to care at all

1:04:06.160 --> 1:04:07.160
 about what my values are.

1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:09.360
 And like maybe Ethereum just like is.

1:04:09.360 --> 1:04:13.320
 I think you have a powerful voice

1:04:13.320 --> 1:04:14.760
 and you can inspire other projects

1:04:14.760 --> 1:04:19.000
 to live up to their best possible selves.

1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:24.000
 Okay, so that's the layer one approach.

1:04:25.640 --> 1:04:28.080
 The other layer one within Ethereum

1:04:28.080 --> 1:04:29.320
 is the idea of sharding.

1:04:29.320 --> 1:04:30.160
 Yes.

1:04:30.160 --> 1:04:31.920
 What the heck is sharding?

1:04:31.920 --> 1:04:32.760
 Okay.

1:04:32.760 --> 1:04:33.600
 What does the future of sharding look like?

1:04:33.600 --> 1:04:36.320
 Right, so to summarize that big long tangent

1:04:36.320 --> 1:04:37.160
 that we just went into.

1:04:37.160 --> 1:04:38.960
 It's a beautiful tangent by the way.

1:04:38.960 --> 1:04:40.040
 It's the basic tangent.

1:04:40.040 --> 1:04:42.800
 And I think like crypto is just one

1:04:42.800 --> 1:04:44.720
 of the most underrated aspects of crypto

1:04:44.720 --> 1:04:48.240
 is I think how you can like analyze the sociology

1:04:48.240 --> 1:04:49.960
 and the politics and the anthropology.

1:04:49.960 --> 1:04:53.000
 And I'm sure Dan Carlin would have fun exploring

1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:54.080
 the space at some point.

1:04:54.080 --> 1:04:56.160
 But like the core trade off, right?

1:04:56.160 --> 1:04:58.200
 Is that if you scale blockchains the dumb way

1:04:58.200 --> 1:04:59.960
 just by increasing the parameters,

1:04:59.960 --> 1:05:01.840
 then eventually you just make it harder and harder

1:05:01.840 --> 1:05:04.960
 to participate as a node and you end up with a system

1:05:04.960 --> 1:05:07.880
 where there's like 20 computers running the whole thing.

1:05:07.880 --> 1:05:09.600
 And it's just very centralized.

1:05:09.600 --> 1:05:11.760
 So sharding basically says, well,

1:05:11.760 --> 1:05:13.680
 instead of just increasing the parameters,

1:05:13.680 --> 1:05:15.600
 what we're going to do is we're going to change

1:05:15.600 --> 1:05:19.080
 the blockchain architecture in such a way

1:05:19.080 --> 1:05:22.720
 that each individual node in the blockchain

1:05:22.720 --> 1:05:25.640
 only needs to store a small portion of the data

1:05:25.640 --> 1:05:27.280
 and only needs to process a small portion

1:05:27.280 --> 1:05:28.840
 of the transactions.

1:05:28.840 --> 1:05:30.680
 So you can think about it as being like inspired

1:05:30.680 --> 1:05:31.520
 by BitTorrent, right?

1:05:31.520 --> 1:05:33.320
 Like on BitTorrent, there's no such thing

1:05:33.320 --> 1:05:35.960
 as a BitTorrent full node that has every movie, right?

1:05:35.960 --> 1:05:38.480
 You know, the work is like split up among a huge number

1:05:38.480 --> 1:05:40.600
 of computers and like that makes sense.

1:05:40.600 --> 1:05:42.440
 That's, you know, the only sane way

1:05:42.440 --> 1:05:43.840
 to scale a system like that.

1:05:45.240 --> 1:05:47.960
 And if they actually tried making a version of BitTorrent

1:05:47.960 --> 1:05:50.360
 that required full nodes that store every movie,

1:05:50.360 --> 1:05:52.760
 then, you know, it would have like zero censorship

1:05:52.760 --> 1:05:54.720
 resistance and it would just like, you know,

1:05:54.720 --> 1:05:56.280
 be dead in an instant.

1:05:56.280 --> 1:05:59.320
 So the challenge with taking that model

1:05:59.320 --> 1:06:01.040
 and applying it to blockchains, right?

1:06:01.040 --> 1:06:04.040
 Is that blockchains aren't just about like spreading data

1:06:04.040 --> 1:06:07.840
 around, they're about agreeing on exactly what data

1:06:07.840 --> 1:06:10.440
 was spread around and ensuring that everything

1:06:10.440 --> 1:06:12.480
 that you agree on actually is correct.

1:06:12.480 --> 1:06:14.920
 And so you have this paradox where let's say

1:06:14.920 --> 1:06:18.600
 you want to have a system that supports 10,000 transactions

1:06:18.600 --> 1:06:20.760
 a second, but each computer in the network

1:06:20.760 --> 1:06:25.000
 can only personally verify a hundred transactions a second.

1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:28.800
 So how can each computer get a guarantee

1:06:28.800 --> 1:06:31.760
 about the other 9,900 without actually going

1:06:31.760 --> 1:06:33.080
 and verifying them themselves?

1:06:33.080 --> 1:06:37.360
 And it turns out that there are some,

1:06:37.360 --> 1:06:40.320
 like a bundle of different tricks that can do that, right?

1:06:40.320 --> 1:06:43.720
 So like one of them is just random sampling.

1:06:43.720 --> 1:06:46.120
 So the idea behind random sampling is like,

1:06:46.120 --> 1:06:49.520
 let's say for simplicity, this is a proof of stake chain

1:06:49.520 --> 1:06:53.320
 and you have 10,000 validators, validators are like,

1:06:53.320 --> 1:06:56.040
 you know, the stakers and like for simplicity,

1:06:56.040 --> 1:06:57.920
 we'll assume they all have the same number of coins, right?

1:06:57.920 --> 1:06:59.880
 If someone has more coins, we'll just kind of split them up

1:06:59.880 --> 1:07:01.640
 and pretend they're 10 stakers.

1:07:01.640 --> 1:07:05.720
 Then you do like some random shuffling

1:07:05.720 --> 1:07:08.320
 and you basically say, these random hundred validators

1:07:08.320 --> 1:07:10.640
 are assigned to validate this block.

1:07:10.640 --> 1:07:11.920
 These random hundred validators

1:07:11.920 --> 1:07:13.120
 are assigned to validate this block.

1:07:13.120 --> 1:07:14.280
 These random hundred validators

1:07:14.280 --> 1:07:16.080
 are assigned to validate this block.

1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:19.640
 And so each individual computer only gets assigned

1:07:19.640 --> 1:07:21.400
 to validate like a small piece,

1:07:21.400 --> 1:07:23.520
 but then the way that the information

1:07:23.520 --> 1:07:25.560
 about like what's valid gets passed around, right?

1:07:25.560 --> 1:07:30.400
 Is that when these hundred participants validate a block,

1:07:30.400 --> 1:07:33.080
 they all sign a message basically saying like,

1:07:33.080 --> 1:07:35.200
 yes, we agree that this block is valid.

1:07:35.200 --> 1:07:37.680
 And then like they combine that signature into one

1:07:37.680 --> 1:07:39.480
 and then they broadcast that signature.

1:07:39.480 --> 1:07:40.760
 And then everyone else,

1:07:40.760 --> 1:07:42.400
 instead of verifying the blocks directly,

1:07:42.400 --> 1:07:44.280
 just verifies that signature, right?

1:07:44.280 --> 1:07:46.240
 And so if I see the signature,

1:07:46.240 --> 1:07:49.080
 I'm not directly convinced that that block is valid,

1:07:49.080 --> 1:07:52.520
 but what I am convinced of is that out of this committee

1:07:52.520 --> 1:07:56.000
 of this randomly selected group of a hundred validators,

1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:58.320
 let's say at least 70 of them agree

1:07:58.320 --> 1:07:59.520
 that this block is valid.

1:07:59.520 --> 1:08:02.120
 And so if I trust that the majority

1:08:02.120 --> 1:08:04.200
 of these participants are all honest,

1:08:04.200 --> 1:08:06.400
 then because it's all randomly selected,

1:08:06.400 --> 1:08:08.200
 the attacker can't just like force themselves

1:08:08.200 --> 1:08:09.280
 into one committee.

1:08:09.280 --> 1:08:13.800
 And so the attacker is gonna be evenly spread out too.

1:08:13.800 --> 1:08:17.760
 And so if the entire set of validators is mostly honest,

1:08:17.760 --> 1:08:19.400
 every committee is gonna be mostly honest.

1:08:19.400 --> 1:08:22.480
 And so like bad blocks are not gonna go through, right?

1:08:22.480 --> 1:08:24.760
 So that's like one simple form of sharding.

1:08:24.760 --> 1:08:26.920
 There was also other more clever things that you can do.

1:08:26.920 --> 1:08:29.960
 So for example, there's this concept of a ZK snarks, right?

1:08:29.960 --> 1:08:31.600
 I'll call it as your knowledge proofs.

1:08:31.600 --> 1:08:34.440
 So this is the idea that you can make a cryptographic proof

1:08:34.440 --> 1:08:39.440
 that says, I verified or I ran some complex computation

1:08:40.880 --> 1:08:43.320
 on this piece of data and I got this answer.

1:08:43.320 --> 1:08:45.680
 And so if you make these kinds of proofs,

1:08:45.680 --> 1:08:47.640
 then like if you see a ZK snark

1:08:47.640 --> 1:08:49.120
 that says some block is valid,

1:08:49.120 --> 1:08:51.920
 then you're convinced that that block is valid.

1:08:51.920 --> 1:08:55.320
 And even if everyone in that committee is evil,

1:08:55.320 --> 1:08:58.280
 like they have no way of making a valid proof

1:08:58.280 --> 1:08:59.680
 for a bad block, right?

1:08:59.680 --> 1:09:00.840
 Like, because the proof itself,

1:09:00.840 --> 1:09:03.560
 like it is a proof that you did the computation

1:09:03.560 --> 1:09:05.920
 where that proof is much easier to verify

1:09:05.920 --> 1:09:08.800
 than just running the computation yourself.

1:09:08.800 --> 1:09:13.800
 And there's once again, super awesome mathematical

1:09:14.440 --> 1:09:17.880
 or cryptographic magic behind making ZK snarks work.

1:09:17.880 --> 1:09:20.120
 But it gives you a little bit of a leg up

1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:23.280
 over the 51% honest assumption.

1:09:23.280 --> 1:09:25.520
 So it's a little hack that improves upon the random

1:09:25.520 --> 1:09:26.440
 sampling thing.

1:09:26.440 --> 1:09:27.280
 Exactly.

1:09:27.280 --> 1:09:28.320
 And like, there's other hacks, right?

1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:30.760
 Like there is another hack called data availability

1:09:30.760 --> 1:09:32.800
 sampling that allows you to make sure that the data

1:09:32.800 --> 1:09:35.080
 in the blocks was actually published.

1:09:35.080 --> 1:09:37.960
 But like, basically, like if you stack a couple

1:09:37.960 --> 1:09:39.520
 of these tricks on top of each other,

1:09:39.520 --> 1:09:41.560
 you can create a system where like I,

1:09:41.560 --> 1:09:44.160
 as an individual participant can be convinced

1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:46.640
 that everything that's going on in this distributed

1:09:46.640 --> 1:09:49.360
 blockchain thing is correct without actually personally

1:09:49.360 --> 1:09:51.000
 checking more than like a percent of it.

1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:52.040
 So that's sharding.

1:09:52.040 --> 1:09:52.880
 That's sharding.

1:09:52.880 --> 1:09:57.880
 But the, as I understand, maybe correct me on this,

1:09:58.120 --> 1:10:03.120
 is in the space of Ethereum, the sharding happens

1:10:03.200 --> 1:10:05.360
 on some fixed number.

1:10:05.360 --> 1:10:07.920
 Like the split is on some fixed number.

1:10:07.920 --> 1:10:11.440
 I think it's 64 is the currently sort of proposed number.

1:10:11.440 --> 1:10:15.760
 So how does that help scaling?

1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:19.080
 Is it just the fixed constant scaling by 64?

1:10:19.080 --> 1:10:21.800
 And is that a way to achieve those crazy,

1:10:21.800 --> 1:10:25.200
 the crazy amount of scaling that seems to be required

1:10:25.200 --> 1:10:28.320
 to use cryptocurrency for purchasing?

1:10:28.320 --> 1:10:30.520
 So doing like competing with credit cards

1:10:30.520 --> 1:10:31.880
 and Visa and so on.

1:10:31.880 --> 1:10:34.640
 So first, I think like the 64 can be hard forked up

1:10:34.640 --> 1:10:35.800
 over time.

1:10:35.800 --> 1:10:39.920
 So we've set it so that like there's theoretically space

1:10:39.920 --> 1:10:42.200
 in the data structure for 1024 shards,

1:10:42.200 --> 1:10:44.200
 it's just that 64 of them are turned on.

1:10:45.320 --> 1:10:47.280
 There are challenges with having more shards

1:10:47.280 --> 1:10:49.560
 because like you have to have logic that just like checks

1:10:49.560 --> 1:10:51.280
 and manages all of those shards.

1:10:51.280 --> 1:10:52.560
 And if there's too many of them,

1:10:52.560 --> 1:10:54.720
 then that becomes too expensive.

1:10:54.720 --> 1:10:57.600
 But even still, you can improve quite a bit.

1:10:57.600 --> 1:11:00.440
 And then the other thing that we're doing is

1:11:00.440 --> 1:11:03.000
 if what we're getting maximum scalability

1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.760
 by combining rollups and sharding.

1:11:05.760 --> 1:11:07.800
 So this might be a good time to talk about rollups.

1:11:07.800 --> 1:11:09.320
 What are rollups?

1:11:09.320 --> 1:11:11.680
 Now we're moving into layer two ideas.

1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:12.520
 Yes.

1:11:12.520 --> 1:11:17.520
 So the idea behind a rollup is basically that,

1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:22.520
 so instead of just publishing transactions

1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:27.520
 directly on chain and having everyone do all of the checking

1:11:27.520 --> 1:11:28.960
 of those transactions,

1:11:28.960 --> 1:11:31.080
 what you do is you create a system

1:11:31.080 --> 1:11:36.080
 where users send their transactions to some central party

1:11:36.640 --> 1:11:37.960
 called an aggregator.

1:11:37.960 --> 1:11:40.120
 And like, well, theoretically, you can have a system

1:11:40.120 --> 1:11:41.600
 where like the aggregator switches around

1:11:41.600 --> 1:11:43.160
 or where anyone can be an aggregator.

1:11:43.160 --> 1:11:46.440
 So it's still like permissionless to send things.

1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:51.160
 Then what the aggregator does is they strip out

1:11:51.160 --> 1:11:55.120
 all of the transaction data that like is not relevant

1:11:55.120 --> 1:11:57.760
 to helping people update the state.

1:11:57.760 --> 1:11:58.680
 So when I say the state,

1:11:58.680 --> 1:12:01.040
 this is a very important kind of technical term

1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:01.880
 for blockchains.

1:12:01.880 --> 1:12:04.640
 I mean, like account balances, code,

1:12:06.280 --> 1:12:08.680
 like things that are like memory,

1:12:08.680 --> 1:12:10.400
 internal memory of smart contracts,

1:12:10.400 --> 1:12:12.040
 like basically everything the blockchain

1:12:12.040 --> 1:12:14.560
 actually has to keep track of and remember, right?

1:12:14.560 --> 1:12:17.680
 So you just put in,

1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:20.240
 you take all these transactions,

1:12:20.240 --> 1:12:22.840
 strip out all the data that's not relevant

1:12:22.840 --> 1:12:24.920
 to telling people how to update the state.

1:12:24.920 --> 1:12:26.720
 And then you take the data that's needed

1:12:26.720 --> 1:12:27.560
 to update the state,

1:12:27.560 --> 1:12:29.000
 and then you like really compress it, right?

1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:31.920
 So like, for example, if we say,

1:12:31.920 --> 1:12:35.640
 I, Vitalik, have an account that's 0xAB58,

1:12:35.640 --> 1:12:37.720
 blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and it's 20 bytes.

1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:38.840
 Well, instead we can say,

1:12:38.840 --> 1:12:44.800
 well, I have an account that is number 1874224 in the tree.

1:12:44.800 --> 1:12:46.360
 And that goes down from 20 bytes

1:12:46.360 --> 1:12:48.080
 to just like an index and a position,

1:12:48.080 --> 1:12:49.120
 which is three bytes, right?

1:12:49.120 --> 1:12:51.480
 So you use all sorts of these fancy compression tricks,

1:12:51.480 --> 1:12:53.160
 and you basically just,

1:12:53.160 --> 1:12:55.600
 instead of publishing all these transactions,

1:12:55.600 --> 1:12:58.480
 you publish this like tiny compressed blob, right?

1:12:58.480 --> 1:13:00.280
 So the amount of data that goes on chain

1:13:00.280 --> 1:13:02.720
 goes down by maybe about a factor of 10, right?

1:13:02.720 --> 1:13:04.160
 And then the second thing is that

1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:06.200
 you don't do the computation on chain,

1:13:06.200 --> 1:13:08.520
 instead you do the computation off chain,

1:13:08.520 --> 1:13:11.200
 and there's one of two ways to do this, right?

1:13:11.200 --> 1:13:12.520
 One is called a ZK rollup,

1:13:12.520 --> 1:13:15.800
 which is you just provide a ZK SNARK that basically says,

1:13:15.800 --> 1:13:17.840
 hey, look, I did this computation,

1:13:17.840 --> 1:13:21.240
 and I have this proof that here's, you know,

1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:23.400
 some hash of the result and it's correct.

1:13:23.400 --> 1:13:24.800
 And then you stick it on chain,

1:13:24.800 --> 1:13:26.720
 and everyone verifies this one proof

1:13:26.720 --> 1:13:29.120
 instead of verifying all these transactions.

1:13:29.120 --> 1:13:31.600
 And then the other approach is called an optimistic rollup,

1:13:31.600 --> 1:13:33.960
 which is basically made of the scheme where,

1:13:33.960 --> 1:13:36.480
 like, first someone says like,

1:13:36.480 --> 1:13:39.520
 hey, this is what I think the result of applying

1:13:39.520 --> 1:13:40.800
 these transactions is.

1:13:40.800 --> 1:13:41.880
 And then someone else can say,

1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:43.680
 I disagree, the result is different.

1:13:43.680 --> 1:13:45.720
 And only if two people disagree,

1:13:45.720 --> 1:13:50.040
 do you actually just like publish all of the data

1:13:50.040 --> 1:13:52.440
 and run that whole block on chain.

1:13:52.440 --> 1:13:53.640
 So if there's disagreements,

1:13:53.640 --> 1:13:55.960
 then you just like run everything on chain

1:13:55.960 --> 1:13:58.720
 and whoever was wrong, like loses a lot of money, right?

1:13:58.720 --> 1:14:00.360
 So like disagreements are very rare

1:14:00.360 --> 1:14:01.640
 and they're very expensive.

1:14:01.640 --> 1:14:02.760
 And then a ZK rollup,

1:14:02.760 --> 1:14:05.160
 you don't even rely on this like challenging game at all,

1:14:05.160 --> 1:14:06.840
 you just rely on a proof.

1:14:06.840 --> 1:14:09.760
 So the core principle is basically that

1:14:09.760 --> 1:14:11.920
 instead of lots of transactions

1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:14.680
 and everyone verifies every transaction,

1:14:14.680 --> 1:14:16.720
 it is you take the transactions,

1:14:16.720 --> 1:14:20.360
 you strip them down and compress them as much as possible,

1:14:20.360 --> 1:14:22.440
 then stick that on the blockchain.

1:14:22.440 --> 1:14:24.520
 You do need to stick something on the blockchain

1:14:24.520 --> 1:14:27.520
 just so that everyone else can like keep up to date

1:14:27.520 --> 1:14:30.080
 with the state so they know what all the contracts are,

1:14:30.080 --> 1:14:31.400
 what all the balances are and all of this,

1:14:31.400 --> 1:14:33.440
 but it's a very small amount of data.

1:14:33.440 --> 1:14:36.560
 And then you use one of these other off chain games,

1:14:36.560 --> 1:14:39.840
 could be this optimistic game, could be a ZK snark

1:14:39.840 --> 1:14:43.080
 to just prove that somebody out there did the computation

1:14:43.080 --> 1:14:44.600
 and the result is correct, right?

1:14:44.600 --> 1:14:47.640
 So you're pushing like 90% of the work off chain

1:14:47.640 --> 1:14:50.160
 and then, well, 90% of the data

1:14:50.160 --> 1:14:52.720
 and 99% of the computation off chain,

1:14:52.720 --> 1:14:54.360
 and then you still have 10% of the data

1:14:54.360 --> 1:14:56.280
 and 1% of the computation on chain.

1:14:56.280 --> 1:14:59.960
 And so your scalability goes up by a factor of about 100.

1:14:59.960 --> 1:15:02.440
 So these systems are already alive

1:15:02.440 --> 1:15:05.480
 for some applications, right?

1:15:05.480 --> 1:15:07.320
 So there's something called loopering,

1:15:07.320 --> 1:15:10.160
 which is just a ZK roll up for payments, right?

1:15:10.160 --> 1:15:15.160
 So you can have assets inside of the loopering system

1:15:15.320 --> 1:15:17.360
 and you can go around and transfer them,

1:15:21.360 --> 1:15:24.560
 and you get like much lower transaction fees, right?

1:15:24.560 --> 1:15:28.400
 Like instead of $5, you'd have to pay like less than 5 cents.

1:15:28.400 --> 1:15:31.560
 But the only problem is that this only supports

1:15:31.560 --> 1:15:33.000
 a couple of applications right now,

1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.560
 like making one that supports anything

1:15:35.560 --> 1:15:37.760
 that you can do on Ethereum just takes a bit more work,

1:15:37.760 --> 1:15:40.040
 but that's being done as well, right?

1:15:40.040 --> 1:15:43.400
 So like within a few months, I'm expecting fully Ethereum

1:15:44.480 --> 1:15:48.760
 capable roll ups to be available as well.

1:15:48.760 --> 1:15:51.800
 So roll ups, just summarizing,

1:15:51.800 --> 1:15:53.120
 do most of the work off chain,

1:15:53.120 --> 1:15:55.920
 put only a little bit on chain, factor of 100 scaling,

1:15:55.920 --> 1:15:57.960
 sharding, another factor of 100 scaling,

1:15:57.960 --> 1:16:00.520
 100 times 100 factor of 10,000,

1:16:00.520 --> 1:16:02.360
 hundreds of thousands of transactions a second,

1:16:02.360 --> 1:16:04.200
 and like, you know, there's your scalability.

1:16:04.200 --> 1:16:05.680
 Okay, so you achieve scalability,

1:16:05.680 --> 1:16:08.120
 you can do a large number of transactions very quickly

1:16:08.120 --> 1:16:11.480
 and the cost of doing those transactions are much lower.

1:16:11.480 --> 1:16:15.800
 You wrote that in the long term ZK roll ups

1:16:15.800 --> 1:16:18.680
 are going to win in terms of layer two technology.

1:16:18.680 --> 1:16:20.960
 Specifically you wrote, in general,

1:16:20.960 --> 1:16:23.800
 my own view is that in the short term,

1:16:23.800 --> 1:16:25.800
 optimistic roll ups, as you were saying,

1:16:25.800 --> 1:16:28.880
 are likely to win out of general purpose EVM computation

1:16:28.880 --> 1:16:33.880
 and ZK roll ups are likely to win out for simple payments,

1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:37.720
 exchange and other application specific use cases,

1:16:37.720 --> 1:16:39.240
 just as you were saying.

1:16:39.240 --> 1:16:40.880
 But in the medium to long term,

1:16:40.880 --> 1:16:44.160
 ZK roll ups will win out in all use cases

1:16:45.040 --> 1:16:48.080
 as ZK SNARK technology improves.

1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:53.080
 Why do you think ZK roll ups are going to win

1:16:53.080 --> 1:16:55.960
 the big picture battle over layer two technologies?

1:16:55.960 --> 1:16:59.400
 So I think ZK roll ups, like once you accept

1:16:59.400 --> 1:17:03.120
 that the technology works are just like conceptually simpler

1:17:03.120 --> 1:17:04.640
 and they have nicer properties.

1:17:04.640 --> 1:17:07.200
 The reason is that they do not have this concept

1:17:07.200 --> 1:17:08.040
 of a challenge game, right?

1:17:08.040 --> 1:17:10.480
 Like, as I mentioned in an optimistic roll up,

1:17:10.480 --> 1:17:13.680
 the way that you ensure that the results are correct

1:17:13.680 --> 1:17:15.200
 is that you let one person submit

1:17:15.200 --> 1:17:16.760
 and like they just submit with no proof.

1:17:16.760 --> 1:17:18.960
 They just say, here's what I think the result is.

1:17:18.960 --> 1:17:20.880
 And then if someone else disagrees,

1:17:20.880 --> 1:17:22.200
 they make their own submission.

1:17:22.200 --> 1:17:23.920
 And then if you have two disagreeing submissions,

1:17:23.920 --> 1:17:25.720
 then you actually publish it on Chase.

1:17:25.720 --> 1:17:27.520
 And then you see who's right.

1:17:27.520 --> 1:17:30.760
 But for this to work, like you need to actually wait

1:17:30.760 --> 1:17:32.240
 for someone to disagree, right?

1:17:32.240 --> 1:17:34.400
 So like, for example, if I have an asset inside

1:17:34.400 --> 1:17:37.000
 of an optimistic roll up and I wants to withdraw it,

1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:38.960
 then I actually have to wait a week to withdraw it.

1:17:38.960 --> 1:17:43.360
 Because like, if the block that contains my withdrawal

1:17:43.360 --> 1:17:44.600
 turned out to be invalid,

1:17:44.600 --> 1:17:46.000
 then there needs to be space for someone

1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:47.520
 to disagree with it, right?

1:17:47.520 --> 1:17:48.720
 Whereas with a ZK roll up,

1:17:48.720 --> 1:17:50.200
 like you don't need time for disagreeing

1:17:50.200 --> 1:17:51.320
 because you just have a proof, right?

1:17:51.320 --> 1:17:52.920
 As soon as a block is submitted,

1:17:52.920 --> 1:17:55.880
 there's a proof and you know it's correct.

1:17:55.880 --> 1:17:59.320
 So if disagreements, especially in the longterm are sparse,

1:17:59.320 --> 1:18:03.360
 then you don't want to do the optimistic,

1:18:03.360 --> 1:18:05.960
 the game theoretic thing, you wanna do the ZK stock.

1:18:05.960 --> 1:18:08.120
 Right, the ZK stuff is just,

1:18:08.120 --> 1:18:09.800
 like you can win a ZK roll up,

1:18:09.800 --> 1:18:11.640
 you can withdraw immediately.

1:18:11.640 --> 1:18:14.480
 You don't have to like worry about the economics

1:18:14.480 --> 1:18:15.960
 of proving as much, right?

1:18:15.960 --> 1:18:18.360
 There's just like fewer issues.

1:18:18.360 --> 1:18:21.720
 The reason why ZK roll ups are not winning everywhere today

1:18:21.720 --> 1:18:24.800
 is because ZK stocks are still a crazy new technology,

1:18:24.800 --> 1:18:27.880
 right, like this is something that 10 years ago,

1:18:27.880 --> 1:18:31.240
 it existed only in theory and there was none in practice.

1:18:31.240 --> 1:18:32.920
 Then, eight years ago,

1:18:32.920 --> 1:18:34.520
 people were just getting excited about it

1:18:34.520 --> 1:18:37.040
 in Bitcoin conferences for the first time.

1:18:37.040 --> 1:18:40.760
 Like four years, starting four years ago

1:18:40.760 --> 1:18:42.360
 or three and a half years ago even,

1:18:42.360 --> 1:18:43.960
 that was the first time you were able to make

1:18:43.960 --> 1:18:46.760
 any ZK stock based anything on Ethereum.

1:18:46.760 --> 1:18:48.560
 And then people started making them

1:18:48.560 --> 1:18:52.080
 and ZK technology has only really become efficient enough

1:18:52.080 --> 1:18:53.760
 to do a lot of things within the past

1:18:53.760 --> 1:18:55.800
 maybe one and a half years.

1:18:55.800 --> 1:19:00.280
 So it's new technology, it's crazy technology,

1:19:00.280 --> 1:19:02.840
 it's admittedly scary technology.

1:19:02.840 --> 1:19:03.840
 If you wanna learn more,

1:19:03.840 --> 1:19:06.320
 I also have an article about this on Vitality.ca.

1:19:06.320 --> 1:19:07.880
 It's actually really, really good.

1:19:07.880 --> 1:19:12.200
 You're, most of your writing, it goes,

1:19:12.200 --> 1:19:14.000
 it's technical but it's accessible.

1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:17.360
 I highly, highly recommend to check out Vitality's articles

1:19:17.360 --> 1:19:20.360
 and blogs, whatever you call them on the website.

1:19:20.360 --> 1:19:22.600
 It's brilliant summary of the work.

1:19:22.600 --> 1:19:25.640
 Actually, Ethereum documentation period is really good.

1:19:25.640 --> 1:19:28.000
 I think that's somewhat crowdsourced.

1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.440
 That documentation is really, really accessible

1:19:30.440 --> 1:19:31.280
 and brilliant.

1:19:32.560 --> 1:19:36.240
 But let me ask about sort of other approaches

1:19:36.240 --> 1:19:39.440
 to layer two, like side chains.

1:19:39.440 --> 1:19:42.400
 So the one popular one is Polygon.

1:19:42.400 --> 1:19:43.920
 What are your thoughts about Polygon,

1:19:43.920 --> 1:19:48.000
 which is a layer two network?

1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:49.720
 Is it positive?

1:19:49.720 --> 1:19:51.200
 Is it negative for Ethereum?

1:19:51.200 --> 1:19:52.040
 Is it both?

1:19:52.040 --> 1:19:53.280
 Does it have a future?

1:19:53.280 --> 1:19:58.160
 Which is its own chain, but it's using Ethereum.

1:19:58.160 --> 1:20:00.920
 It's like based on Ethereum essentially.

1:20:00.920 --> 1:20:02.840
 Or maybe you can describe what it is.

1:20:02.840 --> 1:20:06.240
 So I think there's a really big and important difference

1:20:06.240 --> 1:20:09.000
 in security models between rollups and side chains,

1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:11.600
 which is basically that rollups inherit

1:20:11.600 --> 1:20:13.160
 from the security of Ethereum, right?

1:20:13.160 --> 1:20:17.120
 So if I have coins inside of Loopring or Optimism

1:20:17.120 --> 1:20:19.920
 or Arbitrum or ZK Sync,

1:20:19.920 --> 1:20:22.880
 then even if everyone else in the world

1:20:22.880 --> 1:20:25.000
 who is participating in these ecosystems

1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:27.520
 hates me and wants to steal my money,

1:20:27.520 --> 1:20:30.040
 I can still personally make sure

1:20:30.040 --> 1:20:33.560
 that no matter what happens, I get my money out.

1:20:33.560 --> 1:20:35.440
 It might be a bit expensive for me to get my money out

1:20:35.440 --> 1:20:37.800
 and I have to do transactions on the main chain,

1:20:37.800 --> 1:20:39.480
 but I'll be able to do it.

1:20:39.480 --> 1:20:42.320
 Whereas in Polygon, which is a side chain,

1:20:42.320 --> 1:20:45.080
 and so instead of being secured by Ethereum,

1:20:45.080 --> 1:20:48.040
 it's also in part secured by its own

1:20:48.040 --> 1:20:50.280
 proof of stake consensus with its own token.

1:20:50.280 --> 1:20:53.520
 So if 70% of the whole,

1:20:53.520 --> 1:20:56.560
 or even 51% of the holders of Polygon tokens

1:20:56.560 --> 1:20:59.400
 wanted to take my money in Polygon, they can, right?

1:20:59.400 --> 1:21:03.440
 So that's the, and like, to be fair,

1:21:03.440 --> 1:21:06.440
 like there aren't even, like the supply,

1:21:06.440 --> 1:21:08.640
 I don't think is even that widely distributed, right?

1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:11.800
 So like potentially you could,

1:21:11.800 --> 1:21:14.640
 this idea of 51% of the token holders

1:21:14.640 --> 1:21:16.080
 coming together and stealing everything,

1:21:16.080 --> 1:21:19.400
 like it's not impossible, right?

1:21:19.400 --> 1:21:21.600
 Where does the scaling of Polygon come from?

1:21:21.600 --> 1:21:26.280
 Like why is it able to process much more transactions

1:21:26.280 --> 1:21:28.200
 than the Ethereum main chain?

1:21:28.200 --> 1:21:29.560
 What's the idea there?

1:21:29.560 --> 1:21:32.440
 I think in part, like I imagine,

1:21:32.440 --> 1:21:34.520
 I'm not sure exactly what its capacity level is,

1:21:34.520 --> 1:21:36.720
 but like I imagine it has a higher capacity

1:21:36.720 --> 1:21:38.680
 because it's a bit more willing

1:21:38.680 --> 1:21:40.600
 to take centralization trade offs.

1:21:40.600 --> 1:21:43.000
 And then another thing is that like,

1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:44.880
 if the Ethereum ecosystem,

1:21:44.880 --> 1:21:46.520
 like even if it did not do that, right?

1:21:46.520 --> 1:21:48.080
 If you think about an Ethereum ecosystem

1:21:48.080 --> 1:21:49.920
 hypothetically scaling with side chains,

1:21:49.920 --> 1:21:52.480
 then you would have a hundred copies of Polygon

1:21:52.480 --> 1:21:54.280
 and they would each have their own tokens,

1:21:54.280 --> 1:21:55.520
 they would each have their own chains.

1:21:55.520 --> 1:21:57.600
 And so even if each one of those chains

1:21:57.600 --> 1:22:00.040
 was only as scalable as Ethereum,

1:22:00.040 --> 1:22:02.920
 you could still, like the total sum of them

1:22:02.920 --> 1:22:05.120
 would still be a hundred times more than Ethereum.

1:22:05.120 --> 1:22:05.960
 Okay.

1:22:07.640 --> 1:22:09.640
 The thing that I want to say in Polygon's favor

1:22:09.640 --> 1:22:11.480
 just to be very fair to them,

1:22:11.480 --> 1:22:14.000
 like I really, you know,

1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:15.400
 I definitely really, you know,

1:22:15.400 --> 1:22:16.920
 respect the work that they're doing.

1:22:16.920 --> 1:22:20.560
 So, you know, start with a bit with that word

1:22:20.560 --> 1:22:23.560
 of not criticism caution, right?

1:22:23.560 --> 1:22:28.560
 Like it's that they made this kind of deliberate trade off

1:22:28.880 --> 1:22:30.440
 for very pragmatic reasons,

1:22:30.440 --> 1:22:33.160
 which is that the Ethereum ecosystem needs to scale now.

1:22:33.160 --> 1:22:35.880
 And there are applications that want to do something now.

1:22:35.880 --> 1:22:38.960
 And, you know, if there aren't Ethereum friendly options

1:22:38.960 --> 1:22:40.960
 for them, then like, they're not going to just wait

1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:42.640
 peacefully and do nothing for 12 months.

1:22:42.640 --> 1:22:44.520
 And they're going to go to, you know,

1:22:44.520 --> 1:22:47.480
 either Binance Smart Chain or, you know,

1:22:47.480 --> 1:22:51.000
 one of some other system or potentially something

1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:52.920
 that just has totally no alignment

1:22:52.920 --> 1:22:55.200
 with Ethereum values whatsoever.

1:22:55.200 --> 1:22:58.080
 But whereas, you know, with Polygon,

1:22:58.080 --> 1:23:00.800
 like the best thing that you can say in Polygon's favor

1:23:00.800 --> 1:23:02.720
 and against optimism is that, you know,

1:23:02.720 --> 1:23:05.440
 optimism is not live and Polygon is live, right?

1:23:05.440 --> 1:23:08.440
 Like it just takes more work to create a system

1:23:08.440 --> 1:23:12.320
 that has these extra rollups, security features.

1:23:12.320 --> 1:23:14.920
 And so Polygon just said, we're going to be the system

1:23:14.920 --> 1:23:16.320
 that makes the pragmatic trade off.

1:23:16.320 --> 1:23:19.520
 We're going to go, you know, functionality first,

1:23:19.520 --> 1:23:21.800
 and then, you know, we can talk about adding back

1:23:21.800 --> 1:23:22.960
 the security later.

1:23:22.960 --> 1:23:25.080
 So I've talked to them and like, in principle,

1:23:25.080 --> 1:23:28.840
 I think they're very, you know, open to the idea

1:23:28.840 --> 1:23:33.400
 of like adding more security and like becoming more,

1:23:33.400 --> 1:23:36.040
 becoming a rollup or at least, you know,

1:23:36.040 --> 1:23:38.480
 adding a Polygon chain that's a rollup

1:23:38.480 --> 1:23:39.880
 at some point in the future,

1:23:39.880 --> 1:23:41.960
 which is definitely something I think they, you know,

1:23:41.960 --> 1:23:44.080
 absolutely should follow through on.

1:23:44.080 --> 1:23:47.720
 But like the fact that like they exist now,

1:23:47.720 --> 1:23:51.040
 and so, you know, applications can kind of bootstrap now

1:23:51.040 --> 1:23:52.200
 on a chain that, you know,

1:23:52.200 --> 1:23:53.680
 even though its security isn't perfect,

1:23:53.680 --> 1:23:55.480
 at least it exists and people can go use it.

1:23:55.480 --> 1:23:58.760
 And then over time, you know, the chain matures

1:23:58.760 --> 1:24:00.000
 as the applications mature.

1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:03.360
 Like, you know, it's, I think a very reasonable strategy

1:24:03.360 --> 1:24:04.840
 and I'm definitely really happy

1:24:04.840 --> 1:24:06.640
 that they're part of the ecosystem.

1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:09.760
 Yeah, it's kind of interesting.

1:24:09.760 --> 1:24:14.000
 The history of cryptocurrency has this tension

1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:17.160
 of really good ideas that are hard to implement.

1:24:17.160 --> 1:24:19.480
 So they take longer to implement

1:24:19.480 --> 1:24:23.560
 and ideas that are not as good, but are faster to implement.

1:24:23.560 --> 1:24:26.600
 This is like the story of like, you have like JavaScript

1:24:26.600 --> 1:24:28.400
 that basically took over the world

1:24:28.400 --> 1:24:31.600
 because it was quick to implement within 10 days.

1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:35.120
 And then like later kept fixing itself.

1:24:35.120 --> 1:24:36.840
 I don't know what to make of that.

1:24:37.960 --> 1:24:40.280
 Sort of from an engineering perspective,

1:24:40.280 --> 1:24:42.440
 I'm more and more becoming comfortable

1:24:42.440 --> 1:24:44.400
 and accepting the fact that our whole world

1:24:44.400 --> 1:24:47.160
 will run a technology that's not as good

1:24:47.160 --> 1:24:48.800
 as it could have been.

1:24:48.800 --> 1:24:52.080
 Just because the crappy solution is faster to implement

1:24:52.080 --> 1:24:53.200
 and it sticks.

1:24:53.200 --> 1:24:55.240
 What do you make of that tension?

1:24:55.240 --> 1:24:57.880
 I think the compromise that we've been taking

1:24:57.880 --> 1:25:00.680
 within Ethereum is like when we have to take

1:25:00.680 --> 1:25:03.600
 the crappy solution, we look for crappy solutions

1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:06.560
 that are forward compatible with becoming good over time.

1:25:07.560 --> 1:25:10.240
 When you build the quick and dirty thing,

1:25:10.240 --> 1:25:13.120
 you would still already have ideas in your head

1:25:13.120 --> 1:25:15.640
 about what the more complete thing

1:25:15.640 --> 1:25:18.200
 with all the security features added on would look like.

1:25:18.200 --> 1:25:20.560
 Even if it requires a hard fork?

1:25:20.560 --> 1:25:21.400
 Yes.

1:25:23.160 --> 1:25:26.520
 For example, with sharding, I think it's likely

1:25:26.520 --> 1:25:29.000
 that the first version of sharding that comes out

1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:31.960
 is not going to have zkstarks and data availability sampling,

1:25:31.960 --> 1:25:32.800
 for example.

1:25:32.800 --> 1:25:34.920
 But we know what these technologies are.

1:25:34.920 --> 1:25:37.800
 We feel like we have wrapped our heads around them.

1:25:37.800 --> 1:25:40.800
 And so we know how to build a system

1:25:40.800 --> 1:25:42.640
 where we can put all the pieces in place

1:25:42.640 --> 1:25:45.000
 so that it becomes very easy to bolt those components

1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:46.640
 on in the future.

1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:50.200
 So if you do things that way, then at the beginning,

1:25:50.200 --> 1:25:53.000
 you can have your system that has the functionality,

1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:56.600
 but say has less security or less sustainability

1:25:56.600 --> 1:25:58.240
 or less of something else.

1:25:58.240 --> 1:26:02.360
 But then over time, it's designed in such a way

1:26:02.360 --> 1:26:05.560
 that it has this easy on ramp to adding those things.

1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:07.080
 And if you don't think explicitly

1:26:07.080 --> 1:26:08.680
 about being future compatible,

1:26:08.680 --> 1:26:12.600
 then you do often end up with a quick and dirty solution

1:26:12.600 --> 1:26:14.120
 that backs you into a corner.

1:26:14.120 --> 1:26:16.000
 And then there are definitely cases

1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:18.360
 where I think the Ethereum ecosystem has suffered from that.

1:26:18.360 --> 1:26:22.920
 And we have had to expand pretty significant effort

1:26:22.920 --> 1:26:26.880
 on, for example, removing features that we didn't realize

1:26:26.880 --> 1:26:29.760
 that we actually can't sustain.

1:26:29.760 --> 1:26:32.920
 Like one big example is just increasing the gas costs.

1:26:32.920 --> 1:26:36.560
 So like making some operations more expensive

1:26:36.560 --> 1:26:37.760
 because they should be expensive

1:26:37.760 --> 1:26:40.480
 because they actually take a lot of time in the process.

1:26:40.480 --> 1:26:44.120
 So that's making something more expensive,

1:26:44.120 --> 1:26:46.760
 kind of like taking some functionality away.

1:26:46.760 --> 1:26:49.840
 So if you can like be cognizant

1:26:49.840 --> 1:26:52.200
 of where you're likely going into the future,

1:26:52.200 --> 1:26:54.000
 and if you don't know, like even be cognizant

1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:56.800
 of both the most likely paths that you'll take in the future

1:26:56.800 --> 1:26:59.280
 and coming, like thinking about your roadmap

1:26:59.280 --> 1:27:01.520
 and coming up with a roadmap where you know

1:27:01.520 --> 1:27:04.440
 that like if you wants to do either of those things,

1:27:04.440 --> 1:27:06.600
 then you have a clean path toward it.

1:27:06.600 --> 1:27:09.000
 That's probably the best kind of practical way

1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:12.000
 to get the best of both worlds that we have.

1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:16.540
 Okay, let's talk about this wonderful process of merging.

1:27:19.120 --> 1:27:22.280
 Okay, so there's the main net,

1:27:22.280 --> 1:27:25.200
 which is the Ethereum 1.0 chain,

1:27:25.200 --> 1:27:27.400
 or the, what should we say,

1:27:27.400 --> 1:27:29.140
 the chain that uses proof of work

1:27:29.140 --> 1:27:30.800
 as a consensus mechanism.

1:27:30.800 --> 1:27:33.520
 And then there's, what is it called?

1:27:33.520 --> 1:27:38.520
 The beacon chain that uses the proof of stake mechanism.

1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:45.240
 And I believe the beacon has been deployed successfully,

1:27:45.240 --> 1:27:49.160
 is working, so that was in December of 2020.

1:27:49.160 --> 1:27:50.440
 There's a bunch of questions around that

1:27:50.440 --> 1:27:51.560
 that's fascinating as well,

1:27:51.560 --> 1:27:54.340
 but I think the most fascinating question

1:27:54.340 --> 1:27:58.600
 is about merging those two.

1:27:58.600 --> 1:28:03.400
 When do the two chains, one that's proof of work,

1:28:03.400 --> 1:28:06.360
 one that's proof of stake, merge?

1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:09.440
 And what are the most difficult parts of this process?

1:28:10.280 --> 1:28:12.040
 Right, so as you've said, right,

1:28:12.040 --> 1:28:15.680
 the way that we have set up this proof of stake transition

1:28:15.680 --> 1:28:18.280
 is that at first, the proof of stake chain

1:28:18.280 --> 1:28:19.600
 just launches on its own, right?

1:28:19.600 --> 1:28:22.180
 And this is the thing that happened in December.

1:28:22.180 --> 1:28:25.080
 And the proof of stake chain has been running

1:28:25.080 --> 1:28:28.600
 for close to six months now.

1:28:28.600 --> 1:28:30.360
 I mean, by the time people watch this,

1:28:30.360 --> 1:28:31.960
 it might actually be six months.

1:28:33.080 --> 1:28:35.440
 But it isn't actually coming to consensus

1:28:35.440 --> 1:28:37.480
 on anything except for itself, right?

1:28:37.480 --> 1:28:40.040
 So the idea behind that is to just

1:28:40.040 --> 1:28:43.360
 give the proof of stake chain time to mature,

1:28:43.360 --> 1:28:45.480
 time for people to build the ecosystem around it,

1:28:45.480 --> 1:28:48.160
 time to make sure that there aren't any bugs,

1:28:48.160 --> 1:28:49.640
 and just like prove to the community

1:28:49.640 --> 1:28:51.520
 that no proof of stake actually is real,

1:28:51.520 --> 1:28:55.560
 and a full transition is realistic,

1:28:55.560 --> 1:28:57.560
 because the thing that you're transitioning to

1:28:57.560 --> 1:28:59.480
 already exists and already works.

1:28:59.480 --> 1:29:01.200
 And then at some point in the future,

1:29:01.200 --> 1:29:03.040
 you have this event called the merge,

1:29:03.040 --> 1:29:05.960
 where you basically take the activity

1:29:05.960 --> 1:29:08.040
 that's being done inside of the proof of work chain,

1:29:08.040 --> 1:29:10.360
 and you actually move it over into the proof of stake chain,

1:29:10.360 --> 1:29:13.460
 so you get rid of the proof of work side completely.

1:29:13.460 --> 1:29:18.460
 So the way that the merge will work is,

1:29:18.460 --> 1:29:22.000
 it's definitely gone through a few different iterations.

1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:24.880
 Like the earlier versions of this

1:29:24.880 --> 1:29:26.800
 actually required more work for users

1:29:26.800 --> 1:29:27.840
 and more work for clients.

1:29:27.840 --> 1:29:29.180
 It was much more like,

1:29:29.180 --> 1:29:31.160
 oh, there's this new chain, there's this old chain,

1:29:31.160 --> 1:29:33.600
 and then everyone has to migrate

1:29:33.600 --> 1:29:34.920
 from the old chain to the new chain,

1:29:34.920 --> 1:29:37.400
 and then at some point we'll forget about the old chain.

1:29:37.400 --> 1:29:39.000
 The new version is designed

1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:43.480
 to be much more seamless for users, right?

1:29:43.480 --> 1:29:45.960
 So basically what actually happens is that

1:29:45.960 --> 1:29:49.320
 the old chain basically becomes embedded

1:29:49.320 --> 1:29:50.960
 inside the new chain, right?

1:29:50.960 --> 1:29:54.640
 So starting from the merge transition block,

1:29:54.640 --> 1:29:56.800
 every proof of stake chain block

1:29:56.800 --> 1:29:59.680
 is going to contain a block of the,

1:29:59.680 --> 1:30:01.480
 what we consider now to be,

1:30:01.480 --> 1:30:03.660
 what we consider to be the Ethereum chain today,

1:30:03.660 --> 1:30:05.600
 but we'll call it the execution chain.

1:30:05.600 --> 1:30:08.520
 And then at the same time, to create one of these blocks,

1:30:08.520 --> 1:30:10.880
 you're not going to need proof of work anymore, right?

1:30:10.880 --> 1:30:12.360
 So basically at the same time,

1:30:12.360 --> 1:30:15.000
 you would both get rid of the proof of work requirements

1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:16.560
 for one of these blocks to be valid,

1:30:16.560 --> 1:30:18.840
 but instead you require these blocks

1:30:18.840 --> 1:30:21.560
 to be embedded inside of the proof of stake blocks, right?

1:30:21.560 --> 1:30:24.000
 So you basically have like a chain inside a chain.

1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:28.200
 And this is, from an architecture perspective,

1:30:28.200 --> 1:30:30.080
 you might think it's a little bit suboptimal,

1:30:30.080 --> 1:30:32.240
 but it actually has some nice properties

1:30:32.240 --> 1:30:35.140
 and makes it easier to kind of think about the consensus

1:30:35.140 --> 1:30:38.080
 and think about what we call the execution layer,

1:30:38.080 --> 1:30:40.680
 like transactions and contracts kind of separately

1:30:40.680 --> 1:30:42.120
 and upgrade them separately.

1:30:42.120 --> 1:30:46.500
 And it also just means that the upgrade process

1:30:46.500 --> 1:30:47.740
 is extremely seamless, right?

1:30:47.740 --> 1:30:49.780
 Because from the point of view of a client

1:30:49.780 --> 1:30:50.880
 that's following the chain,

1:30:50.880 --> 1:30:53.400
 you basically have to update nothing, right?

1:30:53.400 --> 1:30:55.680
 You're still following the same chain

1:30:55.680 --> 1:30:56.960
 and follows the same rules,

1:30:56.960 --> 1:30:58.780
 except instead of checking proof of work,

1:30:58.780 --> 1:31:01.020
 you'll switch to checking that these blocks

1:31:01.020 --> 1:31:03.300
 are embedded inside of blocks of the proof of stake chain.

1:31:03.300 --> 1:31:06.000
 So there'll be this merge block

1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:08.080
 that will mark this transition.

1:31:08.080 --> 1:31:11.140
 And over time, I guess the new chain

1:31:11.140 --> 1:31:13.480
 will contain the full record

1:31:13.480 --> 1:31:15.320
 of all the transactions that's ever happened

1:31:15.320 --> 1:31:17.600
 on the previous chain, on the old chain.

1:31:17.600 --> 1:31:20.840
 So maybe I'm asking a dumb question here,

1:31:20.840 --> 1:31:25.560
 but in this process, is the new chain going to have

1:31:25.560 --> 1:31:29.040
 all the information of the past transactions?

1:31:29.040 --> 1:31:33.340
 The new chain is not going to hold information

1:31:33.340 --> 1:31:36.720
 from what happened in the Ethereum chain before the merge,

1:31:36.720 --> 1:31:41.720
 right, so Ethereum clients that people are going to use

1:31:43.520 --> 1:31:45.880
 around the time of the merge and soon after the merge,

1:31:45.880 --> 1:31:48.060
 they're probably just going to sync

1:31:48.060 --> 1:31:50.560
 and check the proof of work chain up to the merge,

1:31:50.560 --> 1:31:52.400
 and then they're gonna check the proof of stake chain.

1:31:52.400 --> 1:31:53.520
 But at some point in the future,

1:31:53.520 --> 1:31:55.080
 I think people will just stop bothering

1:31:55.080 --> 1:31:57.220
 checking the proof of work before the merge.

1:31:57.220 --> 1:32:00.320
 Got it, so that old history information is not important

1:32:01.360 --> 1:32:03.880
 for the future, like if you're operating actively

1:32:03.880 --> 1:32:08.840
 on the new chain, that history is not important to you.

1:32:08.840 --> 1:32:12.360
 It's not important, so it's not strictly important

1:32:12.360 --> 1:32:17.360
 for just like any smart contract

1:32:17.800 --> 1:32:19.920
 or just like applications that run on the blockchain.

1:32:19.920 --> 1:32:21.640
 It can be important to users,

1:32:21.640 --> 1:32:24.160
 and it can be important for some applications,

1:32:24.160 --> 1:32:27.080
 but we're basically saying that like maintaining

1:32:27.080 --> 1:32:29.960
 and serving that is not going to be a simultaneous

1:32:29.960 --> 1:32:32.240
 with the responsibility of every Ethereum node.

1:32:32.240 --> 1:32:34.640
 If you want that information, there can be separate

1:32:34.640 --> 1:32:36.340
 protocols for backing it up.

1:32:36.340 --> 1:32:38.440
 And like these other protocols actually exist, right?

1:32:38.440 --> 1:32:40.180
 Like there's something called the graph,

1:32:40.180 --> 1:32:42.120
 which is doing some history retrieval.

1:32:42.120 --> 1:32:43.960
 Potentially, you can just take that entire chain

1:32:43.960 --> 1:32:45.160
 and stake it on BitTorrent.

1:32:45.160 --> 1:32:48.600
 Like there's lots of ways to like archive it

1:32:48.600 --> 1:32:51.200
 and create kind of customized search protocols for it.

1:32:51.200 --> 1:32:54.520
 So what's your sense why, so there's a Python 2

1:32:54.520 --> 1:32:58.840
 and Python 3, and it took forever for people to switch.

1:32:58.840 --> 1:33:02.880
 What's your sense why this merge has been taking longer

1:33:02.880 --> 1:33:04.420
 than perhaps was expected?

1:33:05.360 --> 1:33:08.760
 I think the biggest reason is just we've been

1:33:08.760 --> 1:33:11.000
 underestimating the technical complexity.

1:33:11.000 --> 1:33:12.480
 There's a lot of technical complexity

1:33:12.480 --> 1:33:14.520
 in making a successful proof of stake chain.

1:33:14.520 --> 1:33:17.120
 There's a lot of technical complexity

1:33:17.120 --> 1:33:20.740
 in actually figuring out the transition process.

1:33:20.740 --> 1:33:22.320
 There's...

1:33:22.320 --> 1:33:24.800
 So that's bigger than social complexity.

1:33:24.800 --> 1:33:27.240
 So the technical complexity you would say

1:33:27.240 --> 1:33:29.760
 is the bigger reason for any delays

1:33:29.760 --> 1:33:31.160
 than the social complexity?

1:33:31.160 --> 1:33:32.400
 I actually think so.

1:33:32.400 --> 1:33:35.080
 I think we've been very fortunate

1:33:35.080 --> 1:33:37.720
 to not have too much social complexity around the merge.

1:33:37.720 --> 1:33:38.960
 So not much drama.

1:33:38.960 --> 1:33:40.320
 No.

1:33:40.320 --> 1:33:42.560
 I think the biggest part of the reason

1:33:42.560 --> 1:33:44.760
 is just because we have been talking

1:33:44.760 --> 1:33:46.040
 about proof of stake and sharding

1:33:46.040 --> 1:33:47.200
 as being part of the roadmap

1:33:47.200 --> 1:33:49.960
 since almost the very beginning of the project, right?

1:33:49.960 --> 1:33:52.400
 Like the very first proof of stake blog post

1:33:52.400 --> 1:33:56.360
 is from January 2014, which was two months

1:33:56.360 --> 1:33:57.760
 after the project started

1:33:57.760 --> 1:34:01.680
 and maybe even a day after the announcement.

1:34:01.680 --> 1:34:06.000
 So proof of stake was not something

1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:09.040
 that we kind of put on anybody by surprise.

1:34:09.040 --> 1:34:11.160
 And then when the Dow fork happened

1:34:11.160 --> 1:34:13.840
 and the people on the ETC side split off,

1:34:13.840 --> 1:34:16.680
 I think it also just happens that a lot of the people

1:34:16.680 --> 1:34:18.840
 that were not willing to stomach the Dow fork

1:34:18.840 --> 1:34:20.400
 and then join the ETC side,

1:34:20.400 --> 1:34:23.120
 they were the more Bitcoiny types.

1:34:23.120 --> 1:34:26.000
 And the more Bitcoiny types do also tend to like proof

1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:26.840
 of work more.

1:34:26.840 --> 1:34:29.160
 And so like that also sort of ended up,

1:34:29.160 --> 1:34:32.600
 sort of like purifying the communities on both sides,

1:34:32.600 --> 1:34:33.440
 I guess.

1:34:33.440 --> 1:34:35.760
 So Ethereum Classic is not switching to proof of stake

1:34:35.760 --> 1:34:38.600
 and they're happy with their setup.

1:34:38.600 --> 1:34:43.600
 And by the time that it came

1:34:43.680 --> 1:34:45.880
 to the beacon chain launching into now,

1:34:45.880 --> 1:34:48.360
 I think the community is very strongly in favor

1:34:48.360 --> 1:34:49.800
 of the proof of stake switch.

1:34:50.920 --> 1:34:55.760
 But let me ask the question that no engineer wants to hear,

1:34:55.760 --> 1:34:57.840
 which is the question of timeline.

1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:03.480
 When do you think the merge will happen?

1:35:03.480 --> 1:35:06.240
 Do you have a sense it might happen this year?

1:35:06.240 --> 1:35:07.760
 Do you have a sense it might be pushed

1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:12.760
 towards next year, 2022 or even beyond?

1:35:14.600 --> 1:35:18.240
 I think early 2022 is the most realistic.

1:35:20.720 --> 1:35:22.840
 There's definitely still like an optimistic case

1:35:22.840 --> 1:35:23.800
 of it happening this year,

1:35:23.800 --> 1:35:27.600
 but the realistic thing to count on is definitely

1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:31.400
 the very early part of next year.

1:35:31.400 --> 1:35:33.400
 Is there specific things that stand out to you

1:35:33.400 --> 1:35:37.920
 that will make you feel good about progress

1:35:37.920 --> 1:35:39.560
 if you see it happening?

1:35:40.480 --> 1:35:43.760
 So the thing that we had last month

1:35:43.760 --> 1:35:46.800
 is we had this online hackathon called Rayanism,

1:35:46.800 --> 1:35:50.600
 where basically a bunch of the different client developers

1:35:50.600 --> 1:35:52.520
 that are going to be part of the transition,

1:35:52.520 --> 1:35:54.880
 like hacks together some test nets

1:35:54.880 --> 1:35:57.520
 of the post merge Ethereum chain.

1:35:57.520 --> 1:35:59.440
 So these were only test nets

1:35:59.440 --> 1:36:01.080
 of what would happen after the merge.

1:36:01.080 --> 1:36:03.320
 They were not test nets of the transition itself.

1:36:03.320 --> 1:36:06.640
 So the thing that people are working on now actually

1:36:06.640 --> 1:36:08.240
 is the transition.

1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:12.320
 So having a full specification

1:36:12.320 --> 1:36:14.520
 of both the transition and post transition,

1:36:14.520 --> 1:36:16.120
 and we have specifications now,

1:36:16.120 --> 1:36:18.720
 but in a realistic way,

1:36:18.720 --> 1:36:20.680
 they'll probably needs to have a couple of changes

1:36:20.680 --> 1:36:23.200
 and have things that continue to be ironed out,

1:36:23.200 --> 1:36:25.560
 and then have a test net

1:36:25.560 --> 1:36:27.960
 that does both the transition and the post transition.

1:36:27.960 --> 1:36:30.080
 And then once you have a test network,

1:36:30.080 --> 1:36:33.000
 then you just have to do a lot of testing and audit it,

1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:38.000
 and then do some runs on not just a specialized test network

1:36:38.200 --> 1:36:39.880
 but on say an existing test network

1:36:39.880 --> 1:36:41.160
 like a Robson or Rinkeby

1:36:41.160 --> 1:36:45.520
 that Ethereum people already significantly use.

1:36:45.520 --> 1:36:46.360
 And if it works,

1:36:46.360 --> 1:36:49.520
 then you can deploy the transition on mainnet.

1:36:49.520 --> 1:36:50.920
 Just as a quick comment,

1:36:50.920 --> 1:36:52.200
 because this is fascinating.

1:36:52.200 --> 1:36:54.320
 In August of last year,

1:36:54.320 --> 1:36:56.720
 there was this Medalla.

1:36:57.520 --> 1:36:59.440
 I believe it's pronounced Medasha.

1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:02.080
 It's a South American subway station.

1:37:02.080 --> 1:37:03.000
 I forget where.

1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:04.520
 But spelled with two Ls.

1:37:04.520 --> 1:37:05.360
 Yeah, yeah,

1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:07.160
 because that's how Spanish works, right?

1:37:07.160 --> 1:37:09.480
 Like the two Ls have a...

1:37:09.480 --> 1:37:10.320
 Medasha.

1:37:10.320 --> 1:37:11.280
 Yeah. Okay, cool.

1:37:11.280 --> 1:37:15.520
 Anyway, but I read about it in middle of August, August 14th,

1:37:15.520 --> 1:37:17.800
 there was an incident on that test net.

1:37:17.800 --> 1:37:22.040
 How does this process work?

1:37:22.040 --> 1:37:23.880
 What do you learn from those kinds of incidents

1:37:23.880 --> 1:37:26.480
 when stuff goes wrong in the test process?

1:37:27.720 --> 1:37:30.320
 I think that incident was that

1:37:30.320 --> 1:37:33.760
 there was a consensus failure of some kind as I remember.

1:37:33.760 --> 1:37:35.680
 Basically just different clients

1:37:35.680 --> 1:37:37.080
 interpreting things in different ways,

1:37:37.080 --> 1:37:39.360
 and then one of them getting kicked off the network.

1:37:39.360 --> 1:37:41.960
 And then it ended up taking a while

1:37:41.960 --> 1:37:45.320
 to actually get everyone to get back online.

1:37:45.320 --> 1:37:47.760
 A big part of the reason why it took weeks to resolve

1:37:47.760 --> 1:37:50.920
 is because it's on a test network,

1:37:50.920 --> 1:37:52.200
 like the coins are valueless.

1:37:52.200 --> 1:37:55.560
 And so there's not really this big push of any kind

1:37:55.560 --> 1:37:58.560
 for people to actually go and download the new clients

1:37:58.560 --> 1:38:00.480
 so they can start participating again.

1:38:00.480 --> 1:38:02.840
 And so it definitely took a while

1:38:02.840 --> 1:38:05.000
 until the chain started finalizing again.

1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:08.520
 And then also there was, I think,

1:38:08.520 --> 1:38:12.040
 another round of just not finalizing in October,

1:38:12.040 --> 1:38:12.920
 as I remember.

1:38:15.720 --> 1:38:17.280
 There were definitely things that we learned.

1:38:17.280 --> 1:38:18.720
 Like there were a lot of things,

1:38:18.720 --> 1:38:20.880
 especially that client developers

1:38:20.880 --> 1:38:22.840
 just learned about like optimization

1:38:22.840 --> 1:38:25.800
 and how to build their clients

1:38:25.800 --> 1:38:28.520
 in a way that they can process things efficiently.

1:38:28.520 --> 1:38:30.360
 There's a lot that we learned

1:38:30.360 --> 1:38:32.360
 from just like seeing the full life cycle

1:38:32.360 --> 1:38:34.920
 of what happens when more than a third of the validators

1:38:34.920 --> 1:38:37.000
 go offline and then finalization stops.

1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:42.000
 And then that kind of weird unusual state

1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:43.520
 of the chain continues for a while.

1:38:43.520 --> 1:38:46.600
 And then eventually everyone who is not participating

1:38:46.600 --> 1:38:48.920
 just gets enough of their stake.

1:38:48.920 --> 1:38:50.680
 Like we don't use the word slashed,

1:38:50.680 --> 1:38:51.920
 we use the word leaked for this,

1:38:51.920 --> 1:38:53.400
 but like basically also burned

1:38:53.400 --> 1:38:56.080
 until the people who are participating

1:38:56.080 --> 1:38:57.080
 go back up to two thirds

1:38:57.080 --> 1:38:59.640
 and then the chain goes back to finalizing.

1:38:59.640 --> 1:39:03.080
 So just seeing all of those edge cases play out live,

1:39:03.080 --> 1:39:04.440
 I think actually helped a lot

1:39:04.440 --> 1:39:05.840
 and probably helped to really contribute

1:39:05.840 --> 1:39:08.960
 to making us feel better about Mainnet.

1:39:08.960 --> 1:39:11.400
 I mean, there's also an incident just recently

1:39:11.400 --> 1:39:15.040
 in April 24th of 2021

1:39:15.040 --> 1:39:18.440
 where this was on Beacon, I guess.

1:39:18.440 --> 1:39:22.680
 There was a bug discovered in the software client Prism

1:39:22.680 --> 1:39:25.480
 that prevented roughly 70% of validators

1:39:25.480 --> 1:39:27.480
 on the network from producing blocks.

1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:30.800
 I mean, maybe you can comment on what happened,

1:39:30.800 --> 1:39:34.360
 but broadly like the big picture,

1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:36.680
 what kind of stuff are you worried about

1:39:36.680 --> 1:39:39.440
 in terms of problems that might arise?

1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:41.280
 Are we talking about small bugs?

1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:45.440
 Are we talking about like emergent social,

1:39:45.440 --> 1:39:48.080
 unexpected social bugs?

1:39:48.080 --> 1:39:49.240
 What are the things that worry you

1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:50.640
 about the future of Ethereum

1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:53.360
 that you want to make sure you construct mechanisms

1:39:53.360 --> 1:39:55.400
 that prevent those things from happening?

1:39:55.400 --> 1:39:57.600
 So one of the lucky things there was

1:39:57.600 --> 1:40:00.160
 that this particular bug only prevented

1:40:00.160 --> 1:40:01.400
 proposed self blocks.

1:40:01.400 --> 1:40:03.400
 It did not prevent attestations.

1:40:03.400 --> 1:40:06.280
 So attestations is just a mechanism for voting on blocks.

1:40:06.280 --> 1:40:08.680
 And it's the attestations that are actually responsible

1:40:08.680 --> 1:40:09.880
 for the chain finalizing.

1:40:09.880 --> 1:40:12.960
 So like coming to this more permanence agreements on blocks.

1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:16.160
 So the chain was actually quite stable all the way through.

1:40:19.080 --> 1:40:21.080
 I think the thing that we generally learned

1:40:21.080 --> 1:40:26.080
 from these experiences is just how valuable it is

1:40:26.120 --> 1:40:28.520
 to have this multi client network.

1:40:28.520 --> 1:40:30.760
 So this is one of these areas where I think Ethereum

1:40:30.760 --> 1:40:33.680
 distinguishes itself from like Bitcoin, for example.

1:40:33.680 --> 1:40:38.400
 That in Ethereum, we don't have one single client

1:40:38.400 --> 1:40:41.640
 that everyone just runs, right?

1:40:41.640 --> 1:40:44.520
 There's multiple implementations of the protocol.

1:40:44.520 --> 1:40:46.120
 And these multiple implementations,

1:40:46.120 --> 1:40:49.440
 they all process and verify the blocks

1:40:49.440 --> 1:40:52.560
 that each other can verify, right?

1:40:52.560 --> 1:40:54.280
 So they all speak the same language.

1:40:54.280 --> 1:40:56.760
 Now, sometimes when there's a bug, they disagree.

1:40:56.760 --> 1:40:59.240
 And when two clients disagree because of a bug,

1:40:59.240 --> 1:41:01.120
 we call this a consensus failure.

1:41:01.120 --> 1:41:03.200
 And consensus failures are pretty serious, right?

1:41:03.200 --> 1:41:08.200
 And when you have a client's monoculture like Bitcoin does,

1:41:08.760 --> 1:41:12.640
 then it's more rare to have consensus failures.

1:41:12.640 --> 1:41:13.840
 Though you still have them actually.

1:41:13.840 --> 1:41:15.200
 Bitcoin had a consensus failure

1:41:15.200 --> 1:41:17.240
 between two different versions of the same client

1:41:17.240 --> 1:41:21.880
 back in 2013, but they're less likely to happen.

1:41:21.880 --> 1:41:25.000
 But the interesting thing is that the multi client

1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:28.320
 architecture has actually, I think, saved Ethereum

1:41:28.320 --> 1:41:30.040
 much more than it's heard it.

1:41:30.040 --> 1:41:31.960
 So even in this most recent incident, right?

1:41:31.960 --> 1:41:33.440
 Like Prism was not producing blocks,

1:41:33.440 --> 1:41:36.920
 but all the other clients were still producing blocks.

1:41:36.920 --> 1:41:38.080
 There's four others, right?

1:41:38.080 --> 1:41:42.080
 Yes, it's a Prism, Nimbus, Teku, and the Lighthouse.

1:41:43.280 --> 1:41:47.320
 And then also Ethereum back in 2016 had this fun events

1:41:47.320 --> 1:41:49.440
 that we call the Shanghai DOS attacks.

1:41:49.440 --> 1:41:52.840
 They're called that because the attacks started

1:41:52.840 --> 1:41:56.960
 right on the first day of our annual conference at DEF CON

1:41:56.960 --> 1:41:59.320
 that happens to be in Shanghai that year.

1:41:59.320 --> 1:42:03.680
 So what happened basically was that someone came up

1:42:03.680 --> 1:42:07.320
 with a way to create blocks that were very slow

1:42:07.320 --> 1:42:10.160
 for one client to process, but not the other client.

1:42:10.160 --> 1:42:12.880
 So at that time, there were basically two Ethereum clients.

1:42:12.880 --> 1:42:15.040
 They were called Geth and Parity.

1:42:15.040 --> 1:42:18.400
 Right now, I think the top three ones are Geth,

1:42:18.400 --> 1:42:20.720
 Nethermind, and Basu.

1:42:20.720 --> 1:42:23.600
 But what happened as a result of us having two clients

1:42:23.600 --> 1:42:26.280
 is that the attacker was just not able to come up

1:42:26.280 --> 1:42:31.280
 with blocks that both clients were completely failing

1:42:31.280 --> 1:42:32.240
 at processing.

1:42:32.240 --> 1:42:35.080
 And so a lot of the miners and a lot of network participants,

1:42:35.080 --> 1:42:37.760
 they just kept on switching between the two implementations

1:42:37.760 --> 1:42:39.040
 depending on which one worked.

1:42:39.040 --> 1:42:44.040
 And that actually really helped the chain survive

1:42:44.880 --> 1:42:47.400
 through that month of attacks as the attacker just kept

1:42:47.400 --> 1:42:50.040
 on hammering at our system and identifying all

1:42:50.040 --> 1:42:53.080
 of the weaknesses and just forcing our clients

1:42:53.080 --> 1:42:56.480
 to do this rapid sprint of just optimizing the hell

1:42:56.480 --> 1:42:58.640
 out of everything and make sure there aren't any

1:42:58.640 --> 1:43:02.520
 of those DOS blocks or DOS bugs remaining.

1:43:02.520 --> 1:43:04.760
 So that was another example.

1:43:04.760 --> 1:43:07.360
 And then as a counter example,

1:43:07.360 --> 1:43:11.240
 so something that also shows the point from the other side,

1:43:11.240 --> 1:43:15.640
 Bitcoin had this bug in 2010, the balance overflow bug.

1:43:15.640 --> 1:43:20.280
 Basically someone created a transaction that had two outputs

1:43:20.280 --> 1:43:24.720
 and those outputs were both of a few billion Bitcoin.

1:43:24.720 --> 1:43:27.920
 So like about two to the power of 63 Satoshis.

1:43:27.920 --> 1:43:29.440
 And then if you add those numbers together,

1:43:29.440 --> 1:43:31.800
 you'll go above two to the power of 64.

1:43:31.800 --> 1:43:35.000
 And of course, computers like once you go above

1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:36.920
 to the power of 64, you wrap around.

1:43:36.920 --> 1:43:40.680
 And so the Bitcoin nodes thought that there was enough money

1:43:40.680 --> 1:43:42.680
 to pay for the transaction because it was asking for,

1:43:42.680 --> 1:43:44.400
 let's say like a billion Satoshis or something,

1:43:44.400 --> 1:43:46.520
 but actually it was asking for two to the power

1:43:46.520 --> 1:43:48.120
 of 64 plus a billion.

1:43:48.120 --> 1:43:51.400
 And so the attacker just managed to create like billions

1:43:51.400 --> 1:43:53.120
 of Bitcoin out of thin air.

1:43:53.120 --> 1:43:57.320
 And this was not only discovered and fixed

1:43:57.320 --> 1:43:59.800
 after something like 12 hours,

1:43:59.800 --> 1:44:02.360
 but if there had been,

1:44:02.360 --> 1:44:05.040
 if Bitcoin had been a multiple implementation system,

1:44:05.040 --> 1:44:08.160
 then what would have almost certainly happened

1:44:08.160 --> 1:44:10.680
 is like one of the clients would have bugged out,

1:44:10.680 --> 1:44:13.280
 but the other clients would have probably

1:44:13.280 --> 1:44:15.040
 actually had a check for that, right?

1:44:15.040 --> 1:44:17.440
 And so there would have been a consensus failure,

1:44:17.440 --> 1:44:21.440
 but at least that would have like alerted everyone

1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:24.080
 that there is a problem very quickly.

1:44:24.080 --> 1:44:25.680
 And it also would have given everyone

1:44:25.680 --> 1:44:28.440
 just like obvious social permission to go and, you know,

1:44:28.440 --> 1:44:30.480
 pick whichever one of the chains is correct

1:44:30.480 --> 1:44:31.960
 and solve the problem.

1:44:31.960 --> 1:44:36.920
 So like, that's, I think a big learning that we've had

1:44:36.920 --> 1:44:40.240
 from multiple of our experiences in the Ethereum ecosystem,

1:44:40.240 --> 1:44:43.240
 just like validating this multi client model.

1:44:43.240 --> 1:44:44.080
 And like, to be fair,

1:44:44.080 --> 1:44:46.160
 it's a model that we get criticized for a lot, right?

1:44:46.160 --> 1:44:48.280
 Like Bitcoin people talk about, you know,

1:44:48.280 --> 1:44:51.120
 the risk of consensus failures that this creates.

1:44:51.120 --> 1:44:53.160
 VC types are like, well, you know,

1:44:53.160 --> 1:44:55.840
 isn't it expensive and wasteful to fund three software teams

1:44:55.840 --> 1:44:57.080
 where you could just be making, you know,

1:44:57.080 --> 1:44:59.480
 one quote focused effort, you know,

1:44:59.480 --> 1:45:00.640
 they love the word focused.

1:45:00.640 --> 1:45:02.480
 And like, you know, Ethereum is not that,

1:45:02.480 --> 1:45:04.520
 but it's amazing despite not being that.

1:45:04.520 --> 1:45:05.360
 Yeah.

1:45:08.560 --> 1:45:12.600
 Basically, yeah, so that was interesting.

1:45:12.600 --> 1:45:16.680
 And then there have definitely been other learnings as well,

1:45:16.680 --> 1:45:18.640
 just from like seeing the chain live

1:45:18.640 --> 1:45:23.160
 and seeing what actually is the staking experience like,

1:45:23.160 --> 1:45:24.920
 what are the actual incentives

1:45:24.920 --> 1:45:26.480
 for all the different participants.

1:45:26.480 --> 1:45:28.960
 So I definitely feel like we're gaining a lot

1:45:28.960 --> 1:45:31.920
 from this sort of one year of trial running the chain

1:45:31.920 --> 1:45:34.520
 before we actually make all of Ethereum depend on it.

1:45:35.640 --> 1:45:37.640
 Let me ask perhaps a strange question,

1:45:37.640 --> 1:45:41.320
 but you know, proponents of Bitcoin will say things like,

1:45:41.320 --> 1:45:42.760
 Bitcoin fixes everything.

1:45:44.080 --> 1:45:46.640
 So why do we need Ethereum?

1:45:47.880 --> 1:45:52.880
 Versus like Bitcoin plus lightning network for scalability

1:45:54.520 --> 1:45:56.320
 and then using Bitcoin for,

1:45:56.320 --> 1:45:58.600
 with this proof of work for security.

1:45:58.600 --> 1:46:02.840
 So in this kind of, it is perhaps sort of a strange question,

1:46:02.840 --> 1:46:04.080
 but it's a high level question.

1:46:04.080 --> 1:46:07.360
 Why do we need another technology?

1:46:07.360 --> 1:46:09.560
 Yes, it has a bunch of nice features,

1:46:09.560 --> 1:46:13.120
 but like doesn't Bitcoin fix everything already?

1:46:13.120 --> 1:46:17.280
 So the thing that always attracted me about Bitcoin

1:46:17.280 --> 1:46:20.520
 is these values of decentralization,

1:46:20.520 --> 1:46:22.960
 creating these open provisional systems

1:46:22.960 --> 1:46:24.720
 that anyone can participate in

1:46:24.720 --> 1:46:27.200
 and that aren't just going to flop over and die

1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:28.840
 if whoever created them gets bored

1:46:28.840 --> 1:46:33.640
 and that are resistant to like whoever runs them

1:46:33.640 --> 1:46:35.400
 breaking the rules and all of these things.

1:46:35.400 --> 1:46:38.680
 And I think that pretty strongly that these principles

1:46:38.680 --> 1:46:40.640
 are like really valid in importance

1:46:40.640 --> 1:46:42.520
 to much more things than just money, right?

1:46:42.520 --> 1:46:45.040
 Like Bitcoin is the blockchain for money

1:46:45.040 --> 1:46:47.040
 and Ethereum was built from the start

1:46:47.040 --> 1:46:49.720
 as a general purpose blockchain, right?

1:46:49.720 --> 1:46:51.560
 There is ether the asset on Ethereum,

1:46:51.560 --> 1:46:56.040
 but then you can also make decentralized financial things,

1:46:56.040 --> 1:46:58.400
 what we call DeFi today.

1:46:58.400 --> 1:47:01.400
 You can make like ENS, the decentralized domain name system.

1:47:02.280 --> 1:47:05.000
 You can put, make prediction markets on it.

1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:09.200
 You can make totally nonfinancial systems

1:47:09.200 --> 1:47:11.960
 that just like keep track of whether or not

1:47:11.960 --> 1:47:13.400
 some certificate was signed

1:47:13.400 --> 1:47:16.720
 or whether or not some like cryptographic key got revoked.

1:47:16.720 --> 1:47:21.280
 There's this big long list of like just interesting things

1:47:21.280 --> 1:47:23.440
 that you could use about blockchains to do, right?

1:47:23.440 --> 1:47:26.480
 Like basically they are sort of the missing piece

1:47:26.480 --> 1:47:29.320
 that where without them,

1:47:29.320 --> 1:47:31.600
 the kinds of things that a decentralized computer network

1:47:31.600 --> 1:47:32.760
 can do is very limited.

1:47:32.760 --> 1:47:33.600
 And once you have them,

1:47:33.600 --> 1:47:36.440
 a lot of those limitations end up going away.

1:47:36.440 --> 1:47:41.440
 And so Ethereum was like always from the beginning

1:47:42.120 --> 1:47:43.040
 about that, right?

1:47:43.040 --> 1:47:45.160
 It's about like, hey, this isn't just money.

1:47:45.160 --> 1:47:48.200
 There's so much more that you could do

1:47:48.200 --> 1:47:51.560
 if you could just go ahead and make any infrastructure

1:47:51.560 --> 1:47:54.080
 or digital institution or DAO

1:47:54.080 --> 1:47:55.560
 or whatever you wanna call it,

1:47:55.560 --> 1:47:58.640
 where the kind of the base layer of the logic

1:47:58.640 --> 1:48:00.920
 is just executed in this open and transparent way

1:48:00.920 --> 1:48:03.400
 where everyone can see what's going on

1:48:03.400 --> 1:48:05.360
 or if you like your zero knowledge proofs,

1:48:05.360 --> 1:48:07.360
 at least everyone can see proofs that prove to you

1:48:07.360 --> 1:48:09.560
 that what's going on follows the rules

1:48:09.560 --> 1:48:13.640
 and you don't need to just constantly keep trusting

1:48:13.640 --> 1:48:14.800
 centralized actors.

1:48:16.080 --> 1:48:18.120
 Hence the smart contracts

1:48:18.120 --> 1:48:21.520
 as being a sort of a core technology as part of Ethereum.

1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:22.360
 Yes, exactly.

1:48:22.360 --> 1:48:24.760
 Smart contracts, the computer programs

1:48:24.760 --> 1:48:25.840
 that are running on Ethereum,

1:48:25.840 --> 1:48:26.960
 they are like the core

1:48:26.960 --> 1:48:29.080
 of what makes Ethereum general purpose.

1:48:29.080 --> 1:48:34.080
 Yeah, so I do think that there's a lot more wrong

1:48:35.520 --> 1:48:37.360
 with the world than just money, right?

1:48:37.360 --> 1:48:40.080
 Like I'm not one of these people who thinks that

1:48:40.080 --> 1:48:42.160
 if you get rid of fiat currency

1:48:42.160 --> 1:48:43.560
 and you replace it with cryptocurrency,

1:48:43.560 --> 1:48:45.440
 then suddenly wars are gonna go away, right?

1:48:45.440 --> 1:48:48.080
 Because like, first of all,

1:48:48.080 --> 1:48:49.120
 like say your average revenue

1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:51.480
 is only a small portion of government revenue, right?

1:48:51.480 --> 1:48:54.400
 It's like what, 5%, 10%, something like that.

1:48:54.400 --> 1:48:58.920
 Second of all, like if you are the sort of,

1:48:58.920 --> 1:48:59.760
 this is one of the things

1:48:59.760 --> 1:49:01.000
 I don't even get about their philosophy.

1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:02.840
 Like, let's say you're the sort of person

1:49:02.840 --> 1:49:06.600
 who is an extreme and very distrusting libertarian

1:49:06.600 --> 1:49:09.320
 and you think that these governments are terrible, right?

1:49:09.320 --> 1:49:11.440
 Like we know today that governments

1:49:11.440 --> 1:49:15.080
 find a combination of things like welfare

1:49:15.080 --> 1:49:17.520
 and things like the military

1:49:17.520 --> 1:49:21.000
 that goes and like bombs people in Afghanistan, right?

1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:24.240
 And so the question you have to ask is like, okay,

1:49:24.240 --> 1:49:29.240
 you with your new, you know, magic newfangled cyber currency

1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:32.160
 that takes over the world,

1:49:32.160 --> 1:49:33.560
 take away the government's ability

1:49:33.560 --> 1:49:34.960
 to have seniorized revenue

1:49:34.960 --> 1:49:37.760
 and so you reduce the government's revenue by 10%.

1:49:37.760 --> 1:49:39.440
 If the government is that evil,

1:49:39.440 --> 1:49:41.720
 which portion of its expenses

1:49:41.720 --> 1:49:43.680
 is it gonna take that 10% from?

1:49:43.680 --> 1:49:45.840
 Is it gonna stop the bombing people in Afghanistan

1:49:45.840 --> 1:49:47.680
 or is it gonna cut welfare?

1:49:47.680 --> 1:49:48.640
 If you think it's the first,

1:49:48.640 --> 1:49:51.560
 you have a very optimistic view of the government, right?

1:49:51.560 --> 1:49:55.920
 So that's, I guess, my perspective

1:49:55.920 --> 1:49:58.480
 on like why the whole, you know,

1:49:58.480 --> 1:50:02.840
 we're going to save the world and create peace

1:50:02.840 --> 1:50:04.760
 by like denying governments the right

1:50:04.760 --> 1:50:07.680
 to stealth taxation kind of perspective

1:50:07.680 --> 1:50:09.520
 doesn't really make much sense for me.

1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:11.200
 And I do think that there is real value

1:50:11.200 --> 1:50:14.920
 that comes from a decentralized and open currency.

1:50:14.920 --> 1:50:18.320
 Like just the fact that there is a financial infrastructure

1:50:18.320 --> 1:50:21.680
 that anyone in the world can go ahead and use, right?

1:50:21.680 --> 1:50:24.600
 It's, that's something that can easily be

1:50:24.600 --> 1:50:25.680
 a big boon for people, right?

1:50:25.680 --> 1:50:29.840
 There's a lot of places where the currency

1:50:29.840 --> 1:50:32.640
 and is much less stable than the dollar.

1:50:32.640 --> 1:50:35.880
 And, you know, these people like they don't like,

1:50:35.880 --> 1:50:37.520
 well, if they use Bitcoin,

1:50:37.520 --> 1:50:39.240
 their only option is to get Bitcoins, right?

1:50:39.240 --> 1:50:42.120
 Which, you know, are also pretty volatile.

1:50:42.120 --> 1:50:44.280
 If they use Ethereum, then, you know, they can get ether,

1:50:44.280 --> 1:50:46.000
 but then they can also get stable coins, right?

1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:47.800
 And you might think that, you know,

1:50:47.800 --> 1:50:49.840
 oh, you're not being ideologically pure.

1:50:49.840 --> 1:50:51.160
 Now you're giving them stable coins,

1:50:51.160 --> 1:50:52.360
 which are mirroring dollars.

1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:54.320
 And obviously dollars are going to collapse too.

1:50:54.320 --> 1:50:56.720
 But the reality is that dollars are vastly more stable

1:50:56.720 --> 1:50:58.440
 than the Venezuelan Bolivar.

1:50:58.440 --> 1:51:03.440
 So like, there are really meaningful and beneficial things

1:51:04.520 --> 1:51:07.800
 that you can give to people by having a global

1:51:07.800 --> 1:51:09.080
 and open financial system.

1:51:09.080 --> 1:51:11.680
 But I think if you want to actually do that,

1:51:11.680 --> 1:51:14.120
 like you have to have much more than just a currency, right?

1:51:14.120 --> 1:51:16.280
 And then if you want to go beyond financial things,

1:51:16.280 --> 1:51:19.880
 then, you know, you have to obviously have much more

1:51:19.880 --> 1:51:21.680
 than a currency and then, you know,

1:51:21.680 --> 1:51:24.960
 you also have to actually take scalability seriously

1:51:24.960 --> 1:51:26.640
 because the nonfinancial applications,

1:51:26.640 --> 1:51:29.240
 like nobody's going to pay $5 a transaction for them.

1:51:31.160 --> 1:51:33.840
 Can we return to dogs?

1:51:33.840 --> 1:51:34.680
 Sure.

1:51:34.680 --> 1:51:35.520
 Woof, woof.

1:51:35.520 --> 1:51:40.200
 No, no, no, no, no.

1:51:40.200 --> 1:51:41.840
 The other one's categorically forbidden.

1:51:41.840 --> 1:51:43.320
 Yeah, categorically forbidden.

1:51:43.320 --> 1:51:45.960
 Is there any cryptocurrency based on cats actually?

1:51:45.960 --> 1:51:46.880
 I think there are.

1:51:46.880 --> 1:51:49.600
 Like, there was cat coin, there was nan coin.

1:51:49.600 --> 1:51:51.600
 For some reason, they just didn't catch on as much

1:51:51.600 --> 1:51:53.160
 as the dog coins did.

1:51:53.160 --> 1:51:56.360
 Okay, so let's talk about Dogecoin and Elon Musk.

1:51:57.840 --> 1:52:01.480
 Elon said that, quote, ideally,

1:52:01.480 --> 1:52:04.680
 Doge speeds up block time 10x,

1:52:04.680 --> 1:52:09.680
 increases block size 10x, and drops fee 100x.

1:52:10.520 --> 1:52:14.160
 Then it wins hands down, end quote.

1:52:14.160 --> 1:52:18.320
 You said in a blog post, partially responding to that,

1:52:18.320 --> 1:52:20.600
 that there are subtle technical reasons

1:52:20.600 --> 1:52:22.120
 why this is not possible.

1:52:23.800 --> 1:52:28.800
 To this, Elon said that you, quote, fear the Doge.

1:52:30.400 --> 1:52:31.600
 So let's talk about this.

1:52:31.600 --> 1:52:34.600
 What are the technical hurdles for Dogecoin

1:52:34.600 --> 1:52:35.920
 that prevent it from becoming

1:52:35.920 --> 1:52:38.880
 one of the primary cryptocurrencies of the world?

1:52:38.880 --> 1:52:41.320
 And do you, in fact, fear the Doge?

1:52:41.320 --> 1:52:43.640
 I definitely feel obligated to correct the record.

1:52:43.640 --> 1:52:45.440
 I definitely do not fear the Doge.

1:52:45.440 --> 1:52:46.280
 Okay.

1:52:46.280 --> 1:52:47.200
 No, I love the Doge.

1:52:47.200 --> 1:52:50.600
 I actually visited the Doge in Japan a few years back.

1:52:51.680 --> 1:52:54.000
 She's an amazing dog, she's still alive.

1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:55.160
 Wait, the original Doge?

1:52:55.160 --> 1:52:56.000
 Yeah.

1:52:56.000 --> 1:52:56.840
 Oh, wow.

1:52:58.480 --> 1:53:02.920
 So, you know, we accept Doge every year

1:53:02.920 --> 1:53:05.640
 for our annual DEF CON conferences.

1:53:05.640 --> 1:53:09.280
 So, I definitely don't think Ethereum

1:53:09.280 --> 1:53:11.480
 is opposed to Doge coins.

1:53:11.480 --> 1:53:13.760
 I kind of want to feel like Ethereum

1:53:13.760 --> 1:53:16.000
 is at least a little bit in spirit itself a Dogecoin.

1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:18.920
 And then, as I mentioned, I love Doge,

1:53:18.920 --> 1:53:22.520
 I bought a bunch of Doge, I still hold a bunch of Doge.

1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:25.560
 On the scalability question,

1:53:25.560 --> 1:53:29.760
 the challenge basically is the limits to scalability

1:53:29.760 --> 1:53:31.920
 and the trade offs with centralization, right?

1:53:31.920 --> 1:53:33.920
 If you just increase the parameters

1:53:33.920 --> 1:53:34.760
 without doing anything else,

1:53:34.760 --> 1:53:37.280
 then it just becomes more and more difficult

1:53:37.280 --> 1:53:38.640
 for people to validate the chain

1:53:38.640 --> 1:53:41.960
 and it just becomes more likely that the chain

1:53:41.960 --> 1:53:44.320
 becomes centralized and becomes vulnerable

1:53:44.320 --> 1:53:45.960
 to all kinds of capture.

1:53:45.960 --> 1:53:48.800
 So, does it need like some of the layer two technologies

1:53:48.800 --> 1:53:50.960
 that we've been talking about?

1:53:50.960 --> 1:53:55.080
 I personally think that if Doge wants to somehow bridge

1:53:55.080 --> 1:53:57.400
 through Ethereum and then people can trade Doge

1:53:57.400 --> 1:53:59.760
 thousands of times a second inside of a loop ring,

1:53:59.760 --> 1:54:01.640
 then that would be amazing.

1:54:01.640 --> 1:54:05.280
 If they want to just like take ZK roll up style technology

1:54:05.280 --> 1:54:07.520
 and just have thousands of transactions a second

1:54:07.520 --> 1:54:10.800
 on their own chain, then that would be a great outcome

1:54:10.800 --> 1:54:11.640
 as well.

1:54:11.640 --> 1:54:15.160
 So, is there ways for Ethereum and Dogecoin

1:54:15.160 --> 1:54:16.880
 to work together?

1:54:16.880 --> 1:54:21.880
 Okay, so there's a power behind a person like Elon Musk

1:54:22.040 --> 1:54:24.200
 pushing the development of a cryptocurrency.

1:54:25.600 --> 1:54:30.000
 Is there ways to leverage that power and that momentum

1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:33.480
 to improve Ethereum, to improve some of the sort of

1:54:33.480 --> 1:54:38.120
 cryptocurrencies that are already technologically advanced

1:54:38.120 --> 1:54:40.480
 and pushing forward that kind of technology?

1:54:41.440 --> 1:54:45.320
 I definitely think there's room for...

1:54:45.320 --> 1:54:48.840
 You know that meme of Doge like taking over,

1:54:48.840 --> 1:54:49.880
 like that storm?

1:54:49.880 --> 1:54:50.720
 I've seen it.

1:54:50.720 --> 1:54:55.720
 Is there a way to ride that storm, that wave of the Doge

1:54:56.080 --> 1:54:57.200
 that's taking over?

1:54:57.200 --> 1:55:00.360
 I think if we can have a secure Doge to Ethereum bridge,

1:55:00.360 --> 1:55:02.040
 then that would be amazing.

1:55:02.040 --> 1:55:04.400
 And then when Ethereum gets its scalability,

1:55:04.400 --> 1:55:07.600
 any scalability thing that works for Ethereum assets,

1:55:07.600 --> 1:55:10.400
 you would be able to also trade wrapped Doge

1:55:10.400 --> 1:55:11.880
 with extremely low transaction fees

1:55:11.880 --> 1:55:13.320
 and very high speed as well.

1:55:13.320 --> 1:55:16.640
 Is there precedence for building secure bridges

1:55:16.640 --> 1:55:18.520
 between cryptocurrencies?

1:55:18.520 --> 1:55:21.240
 Is that, I mean, how difficult is this kind of task?

1:55:21.240 --> 1:55:23.960
 It's definitely something that's in its infancy.

1:55:23.960 --> 1:55:26.480
 There definitely have been some cross chain interaction

1:55:26.480 --> 1:55:28.200
 things that have been done before.

1:55:28.200 --> 1:55:30.920
 So, the earliest is probably the concept of merge mining,

1:55:30.920 --> 1:55:34.200
 right, when a chain just makes its entire

1:55:34.200 --> 1:55:36.480
 proof of work algorithm dependent on

1:55:36.480 --> 1:55:38.960
 the proof of work algorithm of another chain.

1:55:38.960 --> 1:55:41.840
 So, I think famous Dogecoin actually merge mines

1:55:41.840 --> 1:55:44.160
 to Litecoin, which is, I think in retrospect,

1:55:44.160 --> 1:55:45.560
 not looking like a very good choice

1:55:45.560 --> 1:55:47.760
 because now Dogecoin is bigger than Litecoin.

1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:53.480
 But, you know, if there's potentially some way

1:55:53.480 --> 1:55:57.680
 for Dogecoin to merge mine with an Ethereum proof

1:55:57.680 --> 1:55:59.080
 of stake of some kinds,

1:55:59.080 --> 1:56:01.560
 then that could be an interesting alternative.

1:56:04.200 --> 1:56:06.600
 So, that's one type of chain interaction.

1:56:06.600 --> 1:56:09.640
 As far as bridges, like one chain reading another chain,

1:56:09.640 --> 1:56:10.920
 early in Ethereum's history,

1:56:10.920 --> 1:56:13.000
 there was this project called BTC Relay.

1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:14.640
 It's a smart contract on Ethereum

1:56:14.640 --> 1:56:17.000
 that just verifies Bitcoin blocks.

1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:20.160
 I think people stopped really caring about it

1:56:20.160 --> 1:56:22.320
 and maintaining it because there just weren't enough

1:56:22.320 --> 1:56:24.720
 applications that were actually interested

1:56:24.720 --> 1:56:25.720
 in using it at the time.

1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:27.560
 And then the transaction fees got too high

1:56:27.560 --> 1:56:28.920
 to actually maintain it.

1:56:28.920 --> 1:56:33.360
 So, I think if we want to make a BTC Relay 2.0,

1:56:33.360 --> 1:56:35.520
 that becomes cheaper because, you know,

1:56:35.520 --> 1:56:37.040
 it uses snarks or something like that,

1:56:37.040 --> 1:56:38.200
 then you probably could.

1:56:38.200 --> 1:56:42.040
 But maybe now's the time when you actually

1:56:42.040 --> 1:56:44.360
 can do that sort of one way verification.

1:56:44.360 --> 1:56:45.440
 But the one challenge though,

1:56:45.440 --> 1:56:47.760
 is that if he wants to have a bridge

1:56:47.760 --> 1:56:49.920
 that allows you to move assets between chains,

1:56:49.920 --> 1:56:52.000
 then you don't just need one way verification,

1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:53.920
 you need two way verification, right?

1:56:53.920 --> 1:56:55.400
 And Ethereum can verify anything

1:56:55.400 --> 1:56:57.000
 because Ethereum smart contracts

1:56:57.000 --> 1:56:58.760
 can just run arbitrary code.

1:56:58.760 --> 1:57:02.040
 But if you want Bitcoin to be able to do things

1:57:02.040 --> 1:57:03.800
 based on what happens in Ethereum lands,

1:57:03.800 --> 1:57:06.200
 then Bitcoin would have to basically,

1:57:06.200 --> 1:57:07.760
 well, they can do everything with soft forks

1:57:07.760 --> 1:57:10.000
 because that's their religion,

1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:12.560
 but they'll do it that way.

1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:15.120
 And if Doge wants to make a fork

1:57:15.120 --> 1:57:19.840
 where that allows for two way transferability

1:57:19.840 --> 1:57:22.000
 with Ethereum, then they could.

1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:24.640
 I mean, I think that would be a lovely collaboration

1:57:24.640 --> 1:57:27.200
 to make if there's interest.

1:57:27.200 --> 1:57:30.800
 I think there might actually even be some multi SIG funds

1:57:30.800 --> 1:57:33.360
 that has some funding.

1:57:34.280 --> 1:57:35.560
 It's just a bounty for someone

1:57:35.560 --> 1:57:37.280
 to make a bridge between the two.

1:57:37.280 --> 1:57:40.960
 Oh, could you maybe try to psychoanalyze Elon Musk

1:57:40.960 --> 1:57:42.520
 for a brief second?

1:57:42.520 --> 1:57:47.240
 So what are your thoughts about Tesla and Elon Musk's

1:57:47.240 --> 1:57:49.880
 journey through the cryptocurrency world?

1:57:49.880 --> 1:57:53.040
 So first with Bitcoin and then with Dogecoin.

1:57:53.040 --> 1:57:57.400
 So acquiring, holding a large amount of Bitcoin.

1:57:57.400 --> 1:58:01.440
 And I believe, at least considering the acquiring

1:58:01.440 --> 1:58:03.640
 and holding a large amount of Dogecoin.

1:58:03.640 --> 1:58:06.480
 Positives, negatives, what do you think the future

1:58:06.480 --> 1:58:10.040
 for Tesla and SpaceX in the cryptocurrency space looks like?

1:58:10.040 --> 1:58:12.040
 Do you think they'll consider Ethereum?

1:58:13.120 --> 1:58:17.640
 I'm sure that if they stay in the cryptocurrency system

1:58:17.640 --> 1:58:19.480
 at all, then they have to at some point.

1:58:19.480 --> 1:58:24.480
 Bitcoin number one, Dogecoin number,

1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:29.440
 I mean, come on, it deserves to be number three.

1:58:29.440 --> 1:58:31.280
 And then, or number two.

1:58:31.280 --> 1:58:34.600
 And then Ethereum can be whatever that other number is.

1:58:39.960 --> 1:58:42.680
 If Ethereum only becomes a Dogecoin somehow,

1:58:42.680 --> 1:58:46.440
 maybe change the logo to incorporate a dog of some sort.

1:58:46.440 --> 1:58:50.320
 Almost like Doge sneaking behind.

1:58:50.320 --> 1:58:52.200
 Oh, that would be fascinating.

1:58:52.200 --> 1:58:53.120
 For when the merge happens.

1:58:53.120 --> 1:58:56.480
 And I think, Elon, you definitely,

1:58:56.480 --> 1:58:58.160
 I think you would make a mistake

1:58:58.160 --> 1:59:02.280
 if you were to kind of ascribe too much sophisticated,

1:59:02.280 --> 1:59:07.280
 malevolent, or any deep intentionality to the whole process.

1:59:07.280 --> 1:59:10.160
 I think he's just a human being and he likes dogs,

1:59:10.160 --> 1:59:11.280
 just like I like dogs.

1:59:11.280 --> 1:59:14.120
 Yeah, I think that is literally the reasoning

1:59:14.120 --> 1:59:16.240
 behind the whole Dogecoin thing.

1:59:16.240 --> 1:59:18.400
 There is some aspect to which,

1:59:18.400 --> 1:59:23.400
 I mean, the guy helped launch a car into space, right?

1:59:24.240 --> 1:59:27.560
 Like you could ask, like, what is the purpose of that?

1:59:27.560 --> 1:59:30.400
 I think the purpose of that is fun.

1:59:31.280 --> 1:59:35.160
 I think he truly is more and more, especially lately,

1:59:35.160 --> 1:59:39.760
 embodying the whole idea that the most entertaining outcome

1:59:39.760 --> 1:59:42.320
 is the most likely and he's fully embracing

1:59:42.320 --> 1:59:44.040
 the most entertaining outcome.

1:59:44.040 --> 1:59:46.240
 And in many ways, Dogecoin is the most

1:59:46.240 --> 1:59:48.320
 entertaining cryptocurrency.

1:59:48.320 --> 1:59:50.840
 As cryptocurrency becomes more and more impactful

1:59:50.840 --> 1:59:52.520
 in the world, people are getting

1:59:52.520 --> 1:59:53.920
 more and more serious about it.

1:59:53.920 --> 1:59:56.000
 And so he's selecting the cryptocurrency

1:59:56.000 --> 1:59:59.280
 that is the least serious and the most fun.

1:59:59.280 --> 2:00:01.520
 And there's something to that,

2:00:01.520 --> 2:00:05.720
 like coupling fun with technological sophistication

2:00:06.720 --> 2:00:10.360
 and somehow figuring out a way to do that well.

2:00:10.360 --> 2:00:12.400
 I want the world to be fun.

2:00:12.400 --> 2:00:14.240
 I think the world being fun is great.

2:00:15.960 --> 2:00:17.840
 Okay, let me ask about a couple

2:00:17.840 --> 2:00:19.680
 of other technologies if it's okay.

2:00:19.680 --> 2:00:20.520
 Sure.

2:00:20.520 --> 2:00:22.720
 What are your thoughts about Chainlink

2:00:22.720 --> 2:00:24.800
 and hybrid smart contracts that utilize

2:00:24.800 --> 2:00:26.920
 off chain external data sources?

2:00:28.560 --> 2:00:32.480
 And I think it's definitely necessary for a smart contract

2:00:32.480 --> 2:00:35.920
 so that do a lot of things to use off chain data

2:00:35.920 --> 2:00:36.760
 of some kind, right?

2:00:36.760 --> 2:00:38.520
 Like if you want to have a stable coin,

2:00:38.520 --> 2:00:39.880
 you need a price oracle so you know

2:00:39.880 --> 2:00:41.440
 what price you're targeting.

2:00:41.440 --> 2:00:45.560
 If you want to have some fancy no crop insurance gadget,

2:00:45.560 --> 2:00:47.960
 like I think EtherRisk has been doing

2:00:47.960 --> 2:00:49.840
 a lot of good work with that.

2:00:49.840 --> 2:00:53.280
 And I think it was either Kenya or Sri Lanka or both,

2:00:53.280 --> 2:00:56.800
 like they're making a lot of good progress

2:00:56.800 --> 2:00:59.200
 in some of those places.

2:00:59.200 --> 2:01:01.840
 Like you need some kind of oracle to tell you,

2:01:01.840 --> 2:01:04.200
 did it actually rain in this particular area?

2:01:05.200 --> 2:01:07.280
 If he wants to have like assets that mirror

2:01:07.280 --> 2:01:09.320
 other financial assets, you need an oracle.

2:01:09.320 --> 2:01:10.600
 If you want to have a prediction market,

2:01:10.600 --> 2:01:12.040
 you need an oracle.

2:01:12.040 --> 2:01:15.480
 And so projects that provide oracles

2:01:15.480 --> 2:01:18.320
 are definitely really important.

2:01:18.320 --> 2:01:20.400
 There are definitely different kinds of use cases.

2:01:20.400 --> 2:01:22.400
 Like Augur is more about events

2:01:22.400 --> 2:01:24.640
 and the Augur oracle is designed,

2:01:24.640 --> 2:01:26.120
 I think differently from Chainlink, right?

2:01:26.120 --> 2:01:29.160
 Like Chainlink emphasizes the whole,

2:01:29.160 --> 2:01:31.640
 we have a fast automated thing

2:01:31.640 --> 2:01:33.760
 that just gives you data quickly.

2:01:33.760 --> 2:01:37.320
 Whereas Augur is more, we don't give a crap about speed.

2:01:38.200 --> 2:01:40.000
 And look, we don't need to give a crap about speed

2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:41.440
 because if you want to get your money out

2:01:41.440 --> 2:01:44.320
 on a prediction market that where in reality it's resolved,

2:01:44.320 --> 2:01:47.120
 you can probably just sell your coins for 99 cents anyway.

2:01:48.440 --> 2:01:52.360
 So I mean, I think Chainlink is definitely

2:01:52.360 --> 2:01:57.360
 taking a good and important part of the oracle design space.

2:01:58.480 --> 2:02:00.960
 And I'm definitely happy that there's

2:02:00.960 --> 2:02:02.720
 that project taking the task on.

2:02:02.720 --> 2:02:04.840
 I mean, at the same time, I do think that

2:02:04.840 --> 2:02:07.240
 their frog army on Twitter can get a bit intense at times,

2:02:07.240 --> 2:02:08.080
 but like.

2:02:08.080 --> 2:02:10.560
 I mean, is there a way to incorporate

2:02:10.560 --> 2:02:14.480
 sort of oracle network type of ideas into Ethereum?

2:02:14.480 --> 2:02:17.920
 I personally would prefer the Ethereum base layer,

2:02:17.920 --> 2:02:21.920
 like stay away from trying to provide too much functionality

2:02:21.920 --> 2:02:25.960
 because like once you have the Ethereum base layer

2:02:25.960 --> 2:02:29.560
 making a claim about like say the US dollar

2:02:29.560 --> 2:02:33.280
 to Ethereum price, like at some sense,

2:02:33.280 --> 2:02:35.000
 you're basically saying that like Ethereum

2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:38.440
 as a base platform starts making

2:02:38.440 --> 2:02:40.560
 what could be geopolitical statements, right?

2:02:40.560 --> 2:02:44.400
 Like for example, imagine if there was some civil war

2:02:44.400 --> 2:02:46.440
 and the US split up and you had two currencies

2:02:46.440 --> 2:02:47.920
 that both claims to be the US dollar,

2:02:47.920 --> 2:02:50.920
 well, Ethereum would have to pick one

2:02:50.920 --> 2:02:53.040
 for the sake of everyone who was already using that oracle.

2:02:53.040 --> 2:02:56.040
 So does that mean that the blockchain would be

2:02:56.040 --> 2:02:59.400
 taking a position in this big mega political debate?

2:02:59.400 --> 2:03:03.600
 So I think like for just those kinds of reasons,

2:03:03.600 --> 2:03:08.240
 I would personally like prefer Ethereum itself

2:03:08.240 --> 2:03:11.400
 to be more of this sort of pure platform

2:03:11.400 --> 2:03:13.840
 that just analyzes transactions

2:03:13.840 --> 2:03:17.920
 just mathematically using deterministic consensus rules.

2:03:17.920 --> 2:03:20.360
 And then if you need the oracles, that can be layer twos.

2:03:20.360 --> 2:03:23.600
 Like I think Ethereum like benefits

2:03:23.600 --> 2:03:26.320
 from not trying to do everything at layer one

2:03:26.320 --> 2:03:29.320
 and having this like very robust layer two ecosystem

2:03:29.320 --> 2:03:31.400
 where you have all these projects doing interesting things.

2:03:31.400 --> 2:03:34.040
 Yeah, focus on the basic technology avoid the politics.

2:03:34.040 --> 2:03:34.880
 Gotcha.

2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:37.980
 Let me ask a bit of a human question.

2:03:40.320 --> 2:03:43.800
 Charles Hoskinson, someone you've worked with

2:03:43.800 --> 2:03:46.000
 in the early days of Ethereum,

2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:48.840
 there appears to my outsider view

2:03:48.840 --> 2:03:51.080
 to have been a bit of a falling out.

2:03:51.080 --> 2:03:54.020
 Is there positive inspiring human story

2:03:54.020 --> 2:03:56.640
 to be told about why you two parted ways?

2:03:56.640 --> 2:04:01.640
 I kind of want to let the various books

2:04:01.760 --> 2:04:04.280
 about Ethereum speak for themselves,

2:04:04.280 --> 2:04:09.240
 but I feel like since that time,

2:04:09.240 --> 2:04:13.240
 I think Charles has clearly progressed

2:04:14.720 --> 2:04:16.880
 and matured in a lot of ways.

2:04:16.880 --> 2:04:19.720
 And people who follow Charles closely

2:04:19.720 --> 2:04:22.280
 have definitely told me that like 2021 Charles

2:04:22.280 --> 2:04:24.080
 is very different from a 2014 Charles.

2:04:24.080 --> 2:04:26.520
 And I'm sure it's 2021 Vitalik is much different

2:04:26.520 --> 2:04:28.520
 from 2014 Vitalik as well.

2:04:28.520 --> 2:04:32.400
 I'm kind of interested how the 2030 and 2040 Vitalik

2:04:32.400 --> 2:04:34.060
 and Charles look like as well.

2:04:34.060 --> 2:04:35.360
 Oh, interesting.

2:04:35.360 --> 2:04:37.400
 Like the progression of the humans.

2:04:37.400 --> 2:04:39.140
 Is this going to be one of those things

2:04:39.140 --> 2:04:40.720
 where like everyone comes full circle

2:04:40.720 --> 2:04:43.240
 and then 2030 Vitalik and Charles are best friends?

2:04:43.240 --> 2:04:45.600
 Yeah, not necessarily best friends,

2:04:45.600 --> 2:04:50.600
 but some kind of are able to reminisce

2:04:50.600 --> 2:04:55.480
 in ways that puts some of the tension of the past behind.

2:04:55.480 --> 2:04:57.440
 I think such things are possible.

2:04:58.400 --> 2:05:02.840
 I think people definitely absolutely have a right to,

2:05:02.840 --> 2:05:06.200
 and I think should strive to just constantly change

2:05:06.200 --> 2:05:07.400
 and reinvent themselves.

2:05:08.880 --> 2:05:11.080
 Is there something you could say about your thoughts

2:05:11.080 --> 2:05:15.520
 about the Cardano project that Charles Hoskinson leads?

2:05:15.520 --> 2:05:19.200
 They've worked on some interesting ideas

2:05:19.200 --> 2:05:22.680
 that mirror some of the ideas in Ethereum,

2:05:22.680 --> 2:05:27.680
 proof of stake, working on smart contracts

2:05:27.680 --> 2:05:28.880
 and all those kinds of things.

2:05:28.880 --> 2:05:31.440
 Is there something, again, positive,

2:05:31.440 --> 2:05:33.160
 inspiring that you could say?

2:05:33.160 --> 2:05:34.360
 Are they a competitor?

2:05:34.360 --> 2:05:36.300
 Is it complimentary technology?

2:05:37.880 --> 2:05:40.080
 There's definitely interesting ideas in there.

2:05:40.080 --> 2:05:43.080
 I do think Cardano takes a bit of a different approach

2:05:43.080 --> 2:05:45.600
 than Ethereum in that they really emphasize

2:05:45.600 --> 2:05:48.800
 having these big academic proofs for everything,

2:05:48.800 --> 2:05:53.040
 whereas Ethereum tends to be more okay with heuristic arguments

2:05:53.040 --> 2:05:55.960
 in part because it's just trying to do more faster.

2:05:55.960 --> 2:05:59.680
 But there's definitely very interesting things

2:05:59.680 --> 2:06:02.440
 that come out of IOHK research.

2:06:03.760 --> 2:06:05.400
 Can you comment on that kind of idea?

2:06:05.400 --> 2:06:08.840
 I, as sort of having a foot in research,

2:06:08.840 --> 2:06:12.120
 enjoy Charles's kind of emphasis on papers

2:06:12.120 --> 2:06:15.160
 and deep academic rigor.

2:06:15.160 --> 2:06:18.760
 What's the role of deep research rigor

2:06:18.760 --> 2:06:20.520
 in the world of cryptocurrency?

2:06:20.520 --> 2:06:21.360
 Interesting.

2:06:21.360 --> 2:06:22.180
 I'm actually the sort of person

2:06:22.180 --> 2:06:23.880
 who thinks deep rigor is overrated.

2:06:25.160 --> 2:06:27.320
 The reason why I think deep rigor is overrated

2:06:27.320 --> 2:06:32.320
 is because I think in terms of why protocols fail,

2:06:32.840 --> 2:06:37.000
 I think the number of failures that are outside the model

2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:39.320
 is even more important, is bigger and more important

2:06:39.320 --> 2:06:41.760
 than the failures that are inside the model.

2:06:41.760 --> 2:06:43.880
 So if you take selfish mining, for example,

2:06:43.880 --> 2:06:47.480
 that original discovery from 2013

2:06:47.480 --> 2:06:52.480
 that showed how Bitcoin does,

2:06:53.360 --> 2:06:56.200
 even if it has a 50% fault tolerance,

2:06:56.200 --> 2:06:57.280
 assuming everyone's honest,

2:06:57.280 --> 2:07:01.260
 it only has a zero to 33% fault tolerance,

2:07:01.260 --> 2:07:02.800
 depending on your network model,

2:07:02.800 --> 2:07:05.180
 if you assume rational actors.

2:07:05.180 --> 2:07:08.520
 And to me, that was a great example

2:07:08.520 --> 2:07:10.200
 of an outside the model failure, right?

2:07:10.200 --> 2:07:12.440
 Because traditional consensus research,

2:07:12.440 --> 2:07:16.020
 just up until or before the blockchain days,

2:07:16.020 --> 2:07:19.440
 did not think about like incentivization much, right?

2:07:19.440 --> 2:07:21.640
 There was a little bit of thought about incentivization.

2:07:21.640 --> 2:07:23.360
 There's like a couple of papers

2:07:23.360 --> 2:07:25.220
 on the Byzantine altruist rational model,

2:07:25.220 --> 2:07:26.860
 but it wasn't that deep.

2:07:26.860 --> 2:07:28.840
 It was mostly operating under the assumption

2:07:28.840 --> 2:07:31.480
 that we're gonna make consensus

2:07:31.480 --> 2:07:34.620
 between 15 participants and these are institutions.

2:07:34.620 --> 2:07:36.280
 And if something goes wrong,

2:07:36.280 --> 2:07:38.840
 then we can figure out whether or not

2:07:38.840 --> 2:07:40.000
 it was deliberate offline.

2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:42.120
 And if they did something evil, we can sue them.

2:07:42.120 --> 2:07:44.400
 Whereas in the crypto world, you can't sue that, right?

2:07:44.400 --> 2:07:47.720
 And so that whole discovery basically arose

2:07:47.720 --> 2:07:52.720
 just because the model of traditional consensus research

2:07:52.960 --> 2:07:54.840
 just didn't cover those possibilities.

2:07:54.840 --> 2:07:56.600
 And then once you go out of the model,

2:07:56.600 --> 2:07:59.080
 those other issues do exist, right?

2:07:59.080 --> 2:08:01.600
 So, but then at the same time,

2:08:01.600 --> 2:08:04.940
 there definitely are protocols that turn out to be,

2:08:06.140 --> 2:08:08.160
 that do have failures inside the model.

2:08:08.160 --> 2:08:09.780
 Like this reminds me of the time

2:08:09.780 --> 2:08:12.800
 when I think I found a bug

2:08:12.800 --> 2:08:16.160
 in a proposed consensus implementation

2:08:16.160 --> 2:08:18.240
 from either BitShares or EOS.

2:08:18.240 --> 2:08:20.160
 This happened around the end of 2017.

2:08:21.160 --> 2:08:23.440
 So that was definitely inside the model

2:08:23.440 --> 2:08:25.480
 because like they had a very clear idea

2:08:25.480 --> 2:08:26.400
 of what they were trying to achieve.

2:08:26.400 --> 2:08:27.960
 They had a very clear description

2:08:27.960 --> 2:08:30.840
 and like there's a very clear mathematical argument

2:08:30.840 --> 2:08:32.080
 for why the description doesn't lead

2:08:32.080 --> 2:08:33.060
 to what they're trying to achieve.

2:08:33.060 --> 2:08:35.420
 But ultimately what you're trying to achieve

2:08:35.420 --> 2:08:38.380
 can never be fully described in formal language, right?

2:08:38.380 --> 2:08:41.480
 Like I think this is the big discovery of,

2:08:41.480 --> 2:08:43.480
 the AI safety people, for example, right?

2:08:43.480 --> 2:08:48.080
 Like just having a specification of what you want

2:08:48.080 --> 2:08:49.800
 is an insanely hard problem.

2:08:49.800 --> 2:08:52.780
 And like the more powerful the optimizer

2:08:52.780 --> 2:08:54.240
 that you're giving the instructions to,

2:08:54.240 --> 2:08:55.800
 the more you have to be careful.

2:08:55.800 --> 2:09:00.800
 And so, I think there are the kind of these two sides.

2:09:02.680 --> 2:09:05.800
 And then the other thing is that

2:09:05.800 --> 2:09:09.260
 a lot of the academic approach ends up

2:09:09.260 --> 2:09:11.140
 basically optimizing for other people

2:09:11.140 --> 2:09:12.960
 inside of the academic system.

2:09:12.960 --> 2:09:17.840
 And it doesn't really optimize for like curious outsiders.

2:09:17.840 --> 2:09:20.020
 Whereas like I personally totally optimize

2:09:20.020 --> 2:09:23.200
 for curious outsiders, or at least I feel like I strive to.

2:09:23.200 --> 2:09:28.200
 So I guess like that's my case for why I like

2:09:29.120 --> 2:09:31.480
 tends to behave in ways that, you know,

2:09:31.480 --> 2:09:33.400
 occasionally traditional academic types

2:09:33.400 --> 2:09:35.220
 criticize as being reckless.

2:09:35.220 --> 2:09:37.820
 But I mean, on the other hand, you know,

2:09:37.820 --> 2:09:41.680
 there's definitely real benefits that come from

2:09:41.680 --> 2:09:46.400
 like just taking a rigorous approach,

2:09:46.400 --> 2:09:49.600
 especially when, you know, you know what the thing,

2:09:49.600 --> 2:09:51.760
 like, you know what the specification is

2:09:51.760 --> 2:09:53.160
 of what you're trying to get.

2:09:53.160 --> 2:09:56.520
 And like, you're trying to kind of improve your ways

2:09:56.520 --> 2:09:58.760
 or provide protocols that actually provide that.

2:09:58.760 --> 2:10:00.840
 And like, you know exactly what you're looking for.

2:10:00.840 --> 2:10:04.320
 I feel like realistically, you probably wants to do

2:10:04.320 --> 2:10:06.040
 both kinds of analysis.

2:10:06.040 --> 2:10:07.280
 And like, sometimes you even want to do

2:10:07.280 --> 2:10:09.060
 both kinds of analysis in stages, right?

2:10:09.060 --> 2:10:11.760
 Like you have, you want to do more quick and dirty things

2:10:11.760 --> 2:10:14.200
 and even wants public feedback on the quick and dirty stuff.

2:10:14.200 --> 2:10:16.200
 And then later on you formalize it more

2:10:16.200 --> 2:10:17.700
 and then you get more feedback.

2:10:18.660 --> 2:10:23.580
 Like in general, I guess I feel like the norms of research

2:10:23.580 --> 2:10:27.680
 in the future, like the internet has just changed so much.

2:10:27.680 --> 2:10:29.000
 There's no way that it's not going.

2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:32.720
 And you know, it's even changed like collaboration structures

2:10:32.720 --> 2:10:35.520
 and like the patterns in which we work with each other.

2:10:35.520 --> 2:10:38.260
 There's no way that the correct structure

2:10:38.260 --> 2:10:40.760
 for collaborative research is the same

2:10:40.760 --> 2:10:42.120
 as what it was 15 years ago.

2:10:42.120 --> 2:10:46.500
 But like, what combination of these existing components

2:10:46.500 --> 2:10:48.680
 and of new ideas it is, like that's something

2:10:48.680 --> 2:10:50.960
 that's, you know, totally legitimate

2:10:50.960 --> 2:10:52.320
 to kind of fight it out.

2:10:52.320 --> 2:10:54.800
 And I think it's great that there's different ecosystems

2:10:54.800 --> 2:10:56.060
 that have different attitudes to things.

2:10:56.060 --> 2:10:57.260
 Like, you know, I think, you know,

2:10:57.260 --> 2:10:59.840
 there's a big possibility that, you know,

2:10:59.840 --> 2:11:01.160
 things that the Ethereum,

2:11:01.160 --> 2:11:03.280
 ways that the Ethereum ecosystem approaches some problems

2:11:03.280 --> 2:11:04.100
 is totally wrong.

2:11:04.100 --> 2:11:06.360
 And if there's other ecosystems with different principles

2:11:06.360 --> 2:11:09.360
 and they do well, that's something that we can learn from.

2:11:09.360 --> 2:11:11.560
 In the spirit of the depth for a search,

2:11:11.560 --> 2:11:13.320
 can you comment on AI safety?

2:11:13.320 --> 2:11:15.300
 And some people are really worried

2:11:15.300 --> 2:11:18.440
 about the existential risks of artificial intelligence.

2:11:18.440 --> 2:11:22.360
 Is there something you could say that's hopeful

2:11:22.360 --> 2:11:26.720
 about how we avoid in the same kind of line of reasoning

2:11:26.720 --> 2:11:30.140
 about creating formal models versus kind of looking

2:11:30.140 --> 2:11:33.360
 outside the model into what the real world actually is like?

2:11:33.360 --> 2:11:36.580
 Is there some lessons from that we can take

2:11:36.580 --> 2:11:39.000
 and map onto the AI safety world

2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:41.540
 where the potentials of the technology,

2:11:41.540 --> 2:11:45.240
 whether it's in autonomous weapon systems

2:11:45.240 --> 2:11:47.040
 or just the paperclip problem

2:11:47.960 --> 2:11:50.840
 that we can avoid AI destroying the world?

2:11:51.840 --> 2:11:54.360
 So my impression is actually that, like,

2:11:54.360 --> 2:11:56.880
 this is more of a kind of far away impression

2:11:56.880 --> 2:11:58.540
 and it could be wrong, that it might even be

2:11:58.540 --> 2:12:01.480
 that one of the challenges is that AI is not formal enough.

2:12:01.480 --> 2:12:05.860
 Like, because AI is very practitioner oriented, right?

2:12:05.860 --> 2:12:08.600
 Like, it's all about like, hey, I found a couple of hacks

2:12:08.600 --> 2:12:09.900
 and look, I ran them and look,

2:12:09.900 --> 2:12:12.160
 they seem to improve classification accuracy

2:12:12.160 --> 2:12:15.960
 from 0.684 to 0.773.

2:12:15.960 --> 2:12:20.240
 So a lot of the time there just isn't actual science behind

2:12:20.240 --> 2:12:23.720
 why this hack works and why this other hack doesn't work.

2:12:23.720 --> 2:12:27.000
 You just sort of like trial and error your way into it.

2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:30.160
 And I could see how that approach works,

2:12:30.160 --> 2:12:31.280
 but at the same time, like,

2:12:31.280 --> 2:12:34.440
 that approach is not good for eligibility, for example.

2:12:34.440 --> 2:12:36.240
 Like, it's not good for like understanding

2:12:36.240 --> 2:12:37.840
 what the heck is actually going on,

2:12:37.840 --> 2:12:42.000
 like how these kinds of systems conceivably might fail.

2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:45.940
 Like, there's even, you know, a debate on like,

2:12:45.940 --> 2:12:49.200
 can you take GPT3 like things and just scale them up

2:12:49.200 --> 2:12:51.360
 and their intelligence will continue to improve

2:12:51.360 --> 2:12:53.680
 or is there just like some types of reasoning

2:12:53.680 --> 2:12:54.960
 that they're fundamentally bad at

2:12:54.960 --> 2:12:57.400
 and like they're not gonna get good at it

2:12:57.400 --> 2:12:59.760
 no matter how much you like scale this exact same approach

2:12:59.760 --> 2:13:01.200
 and add more hardware to it.

2:13:01.200 --> 2:13:06.200
 So having like thinking about what's going on

2:13:06.560 --> 2:13:08.160
 more explicitly, I mean, my understanding

2:13:08.160 --> 2:13:10.520
 is that a big part of AI safety research

2:13:10.520 --> 2:13:13.840
 is trying to do that sort of stuff, right?

2:13:13.840 --> 2:13:14.840
 Formalize.

2:13:14.840 --> 2:13:19.200
 Yeah, formalize, try to improve just AI eligibility,

2:13:19.200 --> 2:13:21.140
 like trying to understand, you know,

2:13:21.140 --> 2:13:23.040
 if the AI makes some classification

2:13:23.040 --> 2:13:25.520
 so we can actually see like what happens

2:13:25.520 --> 2:13:27.840
 and like what's going on in the middle, right?

2:13:27.840 --> 2:13:30.880
 Whereas with crypto or with traditional cryptography,

2:13:30.880 --> 2:13:33.140
 you know, it's like very much not,

2:13:33.140 --> 2:13:35.240
 well, okay, I mean, I shouldn't quite say that.

2:13:35.240 --> 2:13:37.900
 It's, traditional cryptography is this interesting mix

2:13:37.900 --> 2:13:40.200
 of being very formal and being very informal

2:13:40.200 --> 2:13:43.100
 because it's very formal with,

2:13:43.100 --> 2:13:44.760
 given these security assumptions,

2:13:44.760 --> 2:13:46.000
 prove that the protocol works

2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:47.480
 under these security assumptions.

2:13:47.480 --> 2:13:49.400
 The places where it's very informal is like,

2:13:49.400 --> 2:13:51.280
 well, how do we even know that there isn't

2:13:51.280 --> 2:13:53.480
 an efficient algorithm for factoring numbers?

2:13:53.480 --> 2:13:56.000
 Yeah, we kind of tried it for 40 years.

2:13:56.000 --> 2:13:57.360
 And then, you know, so far,

2:13:57.360 --> 2:13:58.600
 no one's found anything better

2:13:58.600 --> 2:14:00.840
 than the general number field sieve.

2:14:00.840 --> 2:14:03.280
 And like, okay, fine, we'll just assume it's fine.

2:14:03.280 --> 2:14:07.120
 You know, how do we know you can't find the discrete log

2:14:07.120 --> 2:14:08.520
 between two elliptic curve points?

2:14:08.520 --> 2:14:11.040
 Like, nope, did it a couple of decades,

2:14:11.040 --> 2:14:13.360
 no one's found anything faster

2:14:13.360 --> 2:14:15.760
 than like baby step, giant step stuff.

2:14:15.760 --> 2:14:18.120
 So that's,

2:14:18.120 --> 2:14:23.120
 and like, there's definitely ways

2:14:24.080 --> 2:14:25.960
 in which that approach really makes sense, right?

2:14:25.960 --> 2:14:28.800
 Because at least you can concentrate your analysis

2:14:28.800 --> 2:14:30.820
 on a small number of building blocks.

2:14:30.820 --> 2:14:33.000
 And like, you know, you do have some intuitive reasoning

2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:33.940
 about those building blocks,

2:14:33.940 --> 2:14:35.680
 but like at least there is a small number

2:14:35.680 --> 2:14:38.000
 of building blocks and lots of people are looking at them.

2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:40.400
 And then everything else just sort of gets formally built

2:14:40.400 --> 2:14:43.040
 on top and you actually can like mathematically reduce

2:14:43.040 --> 2:14:45.640
 the security of big things to building blocks, right?

2:14:45.640 --> 2:14:47.800
 Like you can have mathematical proofs

2:14:47.800 --> 2:14:51.120
 that say, you know, if you make a ZK Synarch

2:14:51.120 --> 2:14:54.460
 of a yes statement when in reality that statement is false,

2:14:54.460 --> 2:14:59.320
 then you can use that to like extract information

2:14:59.320 --> 2:15:00.760
 out of elliptic curves that, you know,

2:15:00.760 --> 2:15:03.760
 it completely breaks the problem or something like that.

2:15:03.760 --> 2:15:04.600
 So.

2:15:04.600 --> 2:15:08.520
 So ZK Synarch is an example where formalism is beneficial.

2:15:08.520 --> 2:15:09.360
 Absolutely, yeah.

2:15:09.360 --> 2:15:11.320
 And so maybe you can have the same kind of stuff

2:15:11.320 --> 2:15:14.520
 in the AI safety within AI systems

2:15:14.520 --> 2:15:18.740
 that you can get a hold of some kind of aspect

2:15:18.740 --> 2:15:21.320
 of the systems that you can control provably.

2:15:21.320 --> 2:15:24.080
 And then in blockchains and cryptocurrency,

2:15:24.080 --> 2:15:27.360
 I think the one area where consensus mechanisms

2:15:27.360 --> 2:15:29.000
 is still more an art than a science

2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:32.060
 is that these aren't just like technological systems,

2:15:32.060 --> 2:15:33.560
 they're crypto economic systems, right?

2:15:33.560 --> 2:15:35.400
 And they make assumptions about people.

2:15:35.400 --> 2:15:37.760
 And which assumptions you can make about people

2:15:37.760 --> 2:15:39.540
 is not something that you can prove with math.

2:15:39.540 --> 2:15:43.400
 Right, even just the basic 51%.

2:15:43.400 --> 2:15:44.240
 Exactly.

2:15:44.240 --> 2:15:45.160
 Honest.

2:15:45.160 --> 2:15:47.360
 Can you trust the 51%?

2:15:47.360 --> 2:15:49.200
 If you can't trust the 51%,

2:15:49.200 --> 2:15:53.400
 can you trust the other 49% to be able to coordinate

2:15:53.400 --> 2:15:55.080
 on like making their own fork?

2:15:55.080 --> 2:15:56.560
 What will happen to coin prices?

2:15:56.560 --> 2:16:00.000
 Like how do people as human beings react to these events?

2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:02.320
 Like there's all of these assumptions.

2:16:02.320 --> 2:16:03.720
 But no, at the same time,

2:16:03.720 --> 2:16:05.640
 look, if you can write down the assumptions,

2:16:05.640 --> 2:16:08.480
 then you can like do formal things with them.

2:16:08.480 --> 2:16:10.400
 I almost forgot to ask you

2:16:10.400 --> 2:16:13.280
 about one of the most exciting aspects of Ethereum.

2:16:13.280 --> 2:16:14.520
 I mean, it's non technical.

2:16:14.520 --> 2:16:19.520
 I think it's a societal, it's social, which is NFTs.

2:16:19.960 --> 2:16:24.600
 So what do you think about the explosion of NFTs

2:16:24.600 --> 2:16:28.840
 in the recent months, especially in the art world

2:16:28.840 --> 2:16:31.600
 and beyond, and what does the future look like?

2:16:31.600 --> 2:16:35.800
 So this is maybe the social impact on the world,

2:16:35.800 --> 2:16:38.760
 on the individual creators of all kinds.

2:16:38.760 --> 2:16:42.440
 Like is that something you've actually expected to see,

2:16:42.440 --> 2:16:44.680
 NFTs having this kind of impact?

2:16:44.680 --> 2:16:48.120
 And beyond, what do you think will happen

2:16:48.120 --> 2:16:51.720
 in the digital space with NFTs,

2:16:51.720 --> 2:16:54.560
 in virtual reality, in gaming, all those kinds of things?

2:16:55.520 --> 2:16:58.920
 I was definitely surprised by like NFTs in particular.

2:16:58.920 --> 2:17:02.240
 Like I even actually think might be on record somewhere

2:17:02.240 --> 2:17:03.680
 on some tech conference panel.

2:17:03.680 --> 2:17:05.200
 Like they were asking, you know,

2:17:05.200 --> 2:17:07.480
 it was one of those overrated or underrated sections

2:17:07.480 --> 2:17:09.240
 and ask about NFTs and I thought,

2:17:09.240 --> 2:17:11.800
 and I said like, hey, I think NFTs are overrated.

2:17:11.800 --> 2:17:12.880
 And, you know, in retrospect,

2:17:12.880 --> 2:17:14.600
 that turned out to be quite wrong.

2:17:14.600 --> 2:17:17.560
 I think, like, I guess I just personally

2:17:17.560 --> 2:17:19.960
 can't really relate to this concept

2:17:19.960 --> 2:17:22.240
 of like spending a lot of money on a thing.

2:17:22.240 --> 2:17:24.680
 Like there's nothing, you know,

2:17:24.680 --> 2:17:27.360
 there's no clear kind of understanding

2:17:27.360 --> 2:17:31.120
 of why that thing would maintain its value.

2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:34.640
 Uniqueness of a thing having value.

2:17:34.640 --> 2:17:36.200
 Right, exactly.

2:17:36.200 --> 2:17:39.960
 That's like, I definitely like cannot really understand,

2:17:39.960 --> 2:17:42.000
 you know, the psychology behind like buying,

2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:44.480
 you know, paying $200,000 for original art painting.

2:17:44.480 --> 2:17:46.400
 I'd be like, you know, if I had a mansion,

2:17:46.400 --> 2:17:48.520
 just like give me photocopies of everything.

2:17:48.520 --> 2:17:52.200
 You can hang three photocopies of the Mona Lisa section.

2:17:52.200 --> 2:17:53.360
 Why would I even have the Mona Lisa?

2:17:53.360 --> 2:17:55.320
 I think I'd probably just like have some Nyan Cats

2:17:55.320 --> 2:17:56.160
 or something.

2:17:56.160 --> 2:17:57.680
 That's one thing where mathematics

2:17:57.680 --> 2:18:00.000
 or theoretical computer science cannot formalize

2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:01.680
 why the heck NFTs are valuable.

2:18:01.680 --> 2:18:02.520
 Exactly.

2:18:02.520 --> 2:18:07.200
 But the thing that makes me very happy about the space

2:18:07.200 --> 2:18:09.600
 now that it has happened is that,

2:18:09.600 --> 2:18:11.680
 and this gets back to the conversation

2:18:11.680 --> 2:18:12.760
 that we had at the beginning, right?

2:18:12.760 --> 2:18:14.440
 Like I'm interested in this concept

2:18:14.440 --> 2:18:17.360
 of decentralized public goods funding, right?

2:18:17.360 --> 2:18:20.800
 Like I want things that are good and valuable

2:18:20.800 --> 2:18:23.720
 to as much as possible also be things

2:18:23.720 --> 2:18:25.920
 that can economically sustain the people

2:18:25.920 --> 2:18:26.960
 who produce them, right?

2:18:26.960 --> 2:18:29.000
 Because if you don't have that,

2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:32.000
 then either the public goods just don't get produced at all

2:18:32.000 --> 2:18:34.560
 or people make like centralized versions

2:18:34.560 --> 2:18:37.040
 that have some of the properties and try to be substitutes,

2:18:37.040 --> 2:18:39.280
 but actually just like concentrate control

2:18:39.280 --> 2:18:41.040
 in a very small group, right?

2:18:41.040 --> 2:18:43.480
 And both of those things are not very nice.

2:18:43.480 --> 2:18:46.240
 So the nice thing about NFTs would be,

2:18:46.240 --> 2:18:49.560
 well, if you're an artist and you can just mint NFTs

2:18:49.560 --> 2:18:50.640
 and this is a source of revenue,

2:18:50.640 --> 2:18:52.720
 then like great, that's another stream of revenue

2:18:52.720 --> 2:18:57.000
 for creative work that often does still get underfunded

2:18:57.000 --> 2:18:58.160
 and that's amazing.

2:18:58.160 --> 2:18:59.480
 Okay, let me ask you a weird question.

2:18:59.480 --> 2:19:01.320
 We talked about Craig Wright a little bit,

2:19:01.320 --> 2:19:06.320
 but a lot of people write to me, one of two emails.

2:19:06.320 --> 2:19:11.320
 One email is calling any coin outside of Bitcoin a scam

2:19:15.120 --> 2:19:17.760
 and then the other email is saying,

2:19:17.760 --> 2:19:21.160
 my favorite coin is the best coin,

2:19:21.160 --> 2:19:23.560
 it's going to save the world, whatever that coin is.

2:19:25.560 --> 2:19:28.720
 And so I sit back and I look, I have no idea.

2:19:28.720 --> 2:19:33.240
 I try to figure out like the humans that I trust

2:19:33.240 --> 2:19:38.120
 in this space, just the basic human qualities,

2:19:38.120 --> 2:19:41.780
 but do you think some coins are scams?

2:19:43.160 --> 2:19:46.040
 Do you think some coins, maybe another way to ask it,

2:19:46.040 --> 2:19:48.680
 are scamier than other coins?

2:19:48.680 --> 2:19:51.320
 How are people that are looking outside of this space

2:19:51.320 --> 2:19:53.640
 where there's all of these cryptocurrencies

2:19:53.640 --> 2:19:57.520
 supposed to figure out what is a scam and not,

2:19:57.520 --> 2:19:59.440
 or how to use the right kind of language

2:19:59.440 --> 2:20:01.200
 when talking about them?

2:20:01.200 --> 2:20:03.200
 Because there's the harshness of the language

2:20:03.200 --> 2:20:06.160
 from the Bitcoin maximalists that doesn't just say

2:20:06.160 --> 2:20:08.580
 everything's a scam, including Ethereum,

2:20:09.500 --> 2:20:11.560
 but they use terms like shit coin

2:20:11.560 --> 2:20:14.160
 that says it's not only a scam, it's like a waste of time.

2:20:14.160 --> 2:20:17.080
 I mean, every word you can use, they say that.

2:20:17.080 --> 2:20:18.400
 That's very harsh.

2:20:18.400 --> 2:20:22.040
 And then some people just apply the word scam

2:20:22.040 --> 2:20:26.740
 much, much more conservatively and just refer to coins

2:20:26.740 --> 2:20:29.200
 that legitimately are trying to scam people

2:20:29.200 --> 2:20:31.440
 out of their money as scams.

2:20:31.440 --> 2:20:33.120
 So what do we do with this word scam?

2:20:33.120 --> 2:20:35.440
 Should it ever be applied to coins?

2:20:35.440 --> 2:20:39.280
 And is it a binary thing or is it a gray area?

2:20:41.040 --> 2:20:42.840
 I think it's definitely a gray area.

2:20:42.840 --> 2:20:46.280
 There's definitely things that are really and actually scams.

2:20:46.280 --> 2:20:48.240
 I mean, Bitconnect would be one example

2:20:48.240 --> 2:20:51.640
 of something that's way on the scam spectrum.

2:20:51.640 --> 2:20:54.880
 Did you see their 2017 promotional video, by the way?

2:20:54.880 --> 2:20:55.720
 Of Bitconnect?

2:20:55.720 --> 2:20:59.040
 Yeah, hey, hey, hey, what's up, what's up, what's up?

2:20:59.040 --> 2:20:59.880
 Bitconnect!

2:21:01.520 --> 2:21:03.760
 It was this three minute, 48 second video

2:21:03.760 --> 2:21:07.800
 that was just of this guy making this totally crazy rant.

2:21:07.800 --> 2:21:10.720
 And it was at some conference in Vietnam

2:21:10.720 --> 2:21:12.920
 where they were, of course, trying to convince

2:21:12.920 --> 2:21:14.560
 a whole bunch of people to buy this coin

2:21:14.560 --> 2:21:17.680
 and they had these claims about how it would go up in value.

2:21:17.680 --> 2:21:20.580
 That was definitely the peak of these pure,

2:21:23.080 --> 2:21:24.520
 completely scammy coins.

2:21:24.520 --> 2:21:27.640
 And that was definitely really terrible.

2:21:27.640 --> 2:21:29.640
 And I feel like we have less,

2:21:29.640 --> 2:21:31.640
 despite cryptocurrency as a whole being bigger,

2:21:31.640 --> 2:21:34.880
 we actually have quite a bit less of that now.

2:21:34.880 --> 2:21:37.820
 But then, of course, there's this spectrum

2:21:37.820 --> 2:21:40.200
 of things that are not completely scams

2:21:40.200 --> 2:21:42.520
 and then things that are not scams

2:21:42.520 --> 2:21:44.440
 and that are technically totally fine projects

2:21:44.440 --> 2:21:48.520
 but where their community is just incredibly sketchy

2:21:48.520 --> 2:21:50.560
 and then all the way to things

2:21:50.560 --> 2:21:52.440
 that are where the community is nice

2:21:52.440 --> 2:21:55.360
 but maybe the project is just fundamentally incapable

2:21:55.360 --> 2:21:56.640
 of achieving what it's trying to do

2:21:56.640 --> 2:21:57.960
 or in the community doesn't realize

2:21:57.960 --> 2:22:00.160
 and then really good projects, right?

2:22:00.160 --> 2:22:04.200
 So if you wanna go a step,

2:22:04.200 --> 2:22:06.800
 like if that's 100% scam,

2:22:06.800 --> 2:22:09.600
 then what would I call say 80% scam?

2:22:09.600 --> 2:22:11.240
 Well, like Bitcoin SV is one example.

2:22:11.240 --> 2:22:13.640
 This is a Craig Wright's fork of Bitcoin.

2:22:13.640 --> 2:22:15.600
 Theoretically, it's a blockchain, right?

2:22:15.600 --> 2:22:17.000
 It's a fork of Bitcoin.

2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:20.200
 It has some 512 megabyte blocks.

2:22:20.200 --> 2:22:23.360
 If you really wanted to, you could use the blockchain.

2:22:23.360 --> 2:22:24.600
 It satisfies the property

2:22:24.600 --> 2:22:27.280
 so that you can send transactions onto it.

2:22:27.280 --> 2:22:30.760
 You can probably use it as a backup

2:22:30.760 --> 2:22:32.840
 to store your files if you really wanted to

2:22:32.840 --> 2:22:35.840
 just because it has so much space.

2:22:35.840 --> 2:22:40.840
 It might fail, but at the same time,

2:22:42.680 --> 2:22:46.480
 as we basically said, Craig Wright is a scammer

2:22:46.480 --> 2:22:49.640
 and half the community is just totally batshit insane.

2:22:49.640 --> 2:22:53.280
 So the humans of a particular cryptocurrency

2:22:53.280 --> 2:22:56.360
 is what makes for a scam and not like the humans at the top

2:22:56.360 --> 2:22:58.960
 that have a voice guiding the community.

2:22:58.960 --> 2:23:01.720
 Yeah, I think in the case of BSV,

2:23:01.720 --> 2:23:04.840
 the humans, they make just completely wrong

2:23:04.840 --> 2:23:07.680
 and just obviously wrong claims

2:23:07.680 --> 2:23:10.200
 about what BSV is capable of accomplishing

2:23:10.200 --> 2:23:12.640
 and what it can say we could accomplish.

2:23:12.640 --> 2:23:15.320
 And there's just a lot of aspects of it

2:23:15.320 --> 2:23:17.160
 that make it feel like a money grab.

2:23:17.160 --> 2:23:18.400
 So that's one example.

2:23:18.400 --> 2:23:20.840
 And then you gotta go a bit further

2:23:20.840 --> 2:23:23.440
 and then you have the trons of the world.

2:23:23.440 --> 2:23:26.160
 And that's a platform, you can use it,

2:23:26.160 --> 2:23:27.960
 you can do stuff on it.

2:23:27.960 --> 2:23:32.480
 But at the same time, they did plagiarize the IPFS white paper

2:23:32.480 --> 2:23:34.560
 and then they...

2:23:34.560 --> 2:23:36.600
 So there's scammy qualities.

2:23:36.600 --> 2:23:38.560
 See, the thing that throws me off a lot,

2:23:38.560 --> 2:23:43.560
 it's very difficult for me, is that most coins,

2:23:43.920 --> 2:23:47.600
 but the ones that make me feel like are scammy

2:23:47.600 --> 2:23:49.520
 have a large community of people

2:23:49.520 --> 2:23:53.160
 that are super positive about it.

2:23:53.160 --> 2:23:54.720
 Like, and they'll write to me.

2:23:56.320 --> 2:24:00.480
 Now that said, sort of on the flip side of that,

2:24:00.480 --> 2:24:04.160
 Bitcoin people are also very positive.

2:24:04.160 --> 2:24:05.360
 There's some sense in...

2:24:05.360 --> 2:24:09.480
 The reason I was having like squinty eyes

2:24:09.480 --> 2:24:12.600
 looking at Bitcoin for quite a while

2:24:12.600 --> 2:24:14.760
 is like, why is everyone so positive?

2:24:14.760 --> 2:24:18.000
 I was getting total cult vibes.

2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:22.400
 Like the ideas are not grounded in truth,

2:24:22.400 --> 2:24:25.640
 but are grounded in an obsession

2:24:25.640 --> 2:24:29.000
 of like when you can artificially conjure up a truth,

2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:31.680
 which is why I was a little bit like worried about Bitcoin.

2:24:31.680 --> 2:24:33.280
 I think I've learned a lot since then

2:24:33.280 --> 2:24:38.280
 to where like, I learned to separate the community

2:24:38.560 --> 2:24:39.880
 from the ideas.

2:24:39.880 --> 2:24:43.920
 And I think Bitcoin is a revolutionary idea on many fronts,

2:24:43.920 --> 2:24:48.080
 but still a community that's like dogmatically excited

2:24:48.080 --> 2:24:51.240
 about something, whatever that is, makes me skeptical.

2:24:51.240 --> 2:24:53.680
 Maybe it's just like my upbringing,

2:24:53.680 --> 2:24:56.960
 but when everybody's really excited about something,

2:24:56.960 --> 2:25:00.400
 it makes me skeptical.

2:25:02.120 --> 2:25:03.800
 But it also makes me difficult to decide

2:25:03.800 --> 2:25:04.760
 what is this scam or not,

2:25:04.760 --> 2:25:07.320
 because some of the most exciting ideas in this world

2:25:07.320 --> 2:25:09.680
 have a community of people who are excited about it, right?

2:25:09.680 --> 2:25:12.360
 Because it's, I don't know.

2:25:12.360 --> 2:25:14.840
 I think space exploration is super exciting.

2:25:14.840 --> 2:25:17.960
 And there's people, I know a lot of them

2:25:17.960 --> 2:25:21.400
 that are exceptionally excited about space exploration.

2:25:21.400 --> 2:25:23.360
 Does that mean it's a scam?

2:25:23.360 --> 2:25:24.840
 No.

2:25:24.840 --> 2:25:26.200
 So I don't know what to do with that.

2:25:26.200 --> 2:25:28.680
 And so most I just try to stay away, I suppose,

2:25:28.680 --> 2:25:31.320
 but it's unfortunate because I'm sure there's a lot

2:25:31.320 --> 2:25:33.720
 of exciting technologies in that space.

2:25:33.720 --> 2:25:34.760
 Like in the case of Bitcoin,

2:25:34.760 --> 2:25:36.800
 like I would definitely not call Bitcoin a scam.

2:25:36.800 --> 2:25:37.640
 Right.

2:25:37.640 --> 2:25:42.640
 But I would also not call Litecoin a scam.

2:25:43.360 --> 2:25:45.200
 There's people who call Litecoin a scam

2:25:45.200 --> 2:25:47.520
 because they just like say, oh, look,

2:25:47.520 --> 2:25:49.360
 it has no fundamental use case.

2:25:49.360 --> 2:25:52.840
 And the concept of being silver to Bitcoin's gold

2:25:52.840 --> 2:25:53.960
 is just like stupid.

2:25:53.960 --> 2:25:58.240
 And like milli Bitcoin is the silver to Bitcoin's gold.

2:25:58.240 --> 2:26:03.120
 But at the same time, like if you have these people

2:26:03.120 --> 2:26:06.640
 who just, they do seem to earnestly believe this.

2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:09.680
 And like they're trying to just like make Litecoin

2:26:09.680 --> 2:26:11.480
 be a Litecoin as best as they can.

2:26:11.480 --> 2:26:14.760
 Then like, to me that's enough for it to not be a scam.

2:26:17.920 --> 2:26:21.440
 And then, so yeah, I think the biggest gray area

2:26:21.440 --> 2:26:26.440
 is definitely between like projects that are earnest

2:26:27.920 --> 2:26:30.520
 but they have just all sorts of these

2:26:30.520 --> 2:26:34.400
 like different combinations of flawed qualities to them.

2:26:34.400 --> 2:26:36.760
 I mean, the ones that legitimately is a scam

2:26:36.760 --> 2:26:40.000
 is when the key people that are at the head of the project

2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:42.440
 are intentionally lying.

2:26:42.440 --> 2:26:45.920
 And I think as long as the intent

2:26:45.920 --> 2:26:48.160
 is to try to do good in the world,

2:26:48.160 --> 2:26:51.800
 even if your actual implementation of that is flawed,

2:26:51.800 --> 2:26:53.520
 I think that's not a scam.

2:26:53.520 --> 2:26:55.680
 It could be flawed ideas, it could be wrong ideas,

2:26:55.680 --> 2:26:56.760
 but it's not a scam.

2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:00.560
 I'm learning to navigate this space.

2:27:00.560 --> 2:27:03.960
 Yeah, it's definitely a very challenging space

2:27:03.960 --> 2:27:07.840
 to navigate, I mean, it's in some ways

2:27:07.840 --> 2:27:10.240
 the reflection of the world at large.

2:27:10.240 --> 2:27:13.040
 Yeah, and as we've said, maybe offline

2:27:13.040 --> 2:27:15.200
 that the fact that money is involved

2:27:15.200 --> 2:27:17.480
 makes it a little bit more complicated

2:27:17.480 --> 2:27:22.480
 that lives can be ruined by the choice of technologies

2:27:24.840 --> 2:27:25.680
 that are taken on.

2:27:25.680 --> 2:27:28.920
 So it makes it more real, more painful,

2:27:28.920 --> 2:27:31.720
 more like elevated the impact of this.

2:27:31.720 --> 2:27:35.160
 Like imagine like Mac versus PC wars

2:27:35.160 --> 2:27:38.520
 if everyone who bought a MacBook had 10 Apple shares

2:27:38.520 --> 2:27:40.200
 inside of it, and everyone who had a PC

2:27:40.200 --> 2:27:42.360
 had 10 Microsoft shares inside of it.

2:27:42.360 --> 2:27:45.960
 And then you had the elites who bought their Macs

2:27:45.960 --> 2:27:48.960
 back in 1983, and then they spent $500 debt,

2:27:48.960 --> 2:27:50.400
 and now they have $40 million,

2:27:50.400 --> 2:27:52.720
 and they just think that they're these gurus

2:27:52.720 --> 2:27:55.360
 who understands the future of finance and geopolitics,

2:27:55.360 --> 2:27:59.080
 and they make theories about why Apple is the one

2:27:59.080 --> 2:28:00.720
 that's gonna bring freedom to the world,

2:28:00.720 --> 2:28:05.120
 and Windows is secretly allied with the axis of evil.

2:28:05.120 --> 2:28:06.120
 Oh, that's brilliant.

2:28:06.120 --> 2:28:07.720
 So yeah, this is so brilliant.

2:28:07.720 --> 2:28:09.560
 So I think the right way to think about this

2:28:09.560 --> 2:28:12.660
 is we map some of the cryptocurrency battles

2:28:12.660 --> 2:28:14.800
 into the space of like EMAX versus VIM,

2:28:14.800 --> 2:28:19.340
 or Apple versus PC, if there were some stock

2:28:19.340 --> 2:28:23.960
 that came along with each implementation of each PC,

2:28:23.960 --> 2:28:25.640
 each Mac, that's fascinating.

2:28:25.640 --> 2:28:28.880
 This is 100% correct, 100% correct.

2:28:28.880 --> 2:28:31.160
 Because then that really energizes the armies

2:28:31.160 --> 2:28:32.640
 of people debating over this in a way

2:28:32.640 --> 2:28:35.580
 that something without money does not.

2:28:35.580 --> 2:28:38.540
 Okay, let me ask you about something really fascinating

2:28:38.540 --> 2:28:41.500
 that you are also excited about, which is longevity,

2:28:42.520 --> 2:28:44.240
 antiaging.

2:28:44.240 --> 2:28:48.280
 You have donated money to the SENS Foundation,

2:28:48.280 --> 2:28:50.800
 so you have an interest in this whole space

2:28:50.800 --> 2:28:51.980
 of lifespan research.

2:28:53.240 --> 2:28:54.560
 What's your vision here?

2:28:54.560 --> 2:28:58.000
 Or what do you hope to see in antiaging

2:28:58.000 --> 2:28:59.880
 and longevity research?

2:28:59.880 --> 2:29:03.120
 I think I hope to see the concept

2:29:03.120 --> 2:29:06.440
 of seeing your parents and grandparents die

2:29:06.440 --> 2:29:08.940
 just slowly disappear from the public consciousness

2:29:08.940 --> 2:29:10.680
 as an experience that happens

2:29:10.680 --> 2:29:12.600
 over the course of half a century,

2:29:12.600 --> 2:29:15.080
 the same way that getting lost in a city

2:29:15.080 --> 2:29:16.960
 slowly disappeared over the public consciousness

2:29:16.960 --> 2:29:19.760
 over the last 50 now that we have smartphones.

2:29:19.760 --> 2:29:21.960
 The thing you have from Nick Bostrom,

2:29:21.960 --> 2:29:26.840
 the essay pinned in your Twitter argues

2:29:26.840 --> 2:29:31.840
 that essentially death is almost unethical.

2:29:33.160 --> 2:29:36.360
 The fact that we don't do something about this thing that,

2:29:36.360 --> 2:29:38.680
 this, in the essay, is a dragon

2:29:38.680 --> 2:29:43.560
 that keeps murdering everybody around us,

2:29:43.560 --> 2:29:46.000
 including our parents and grandparents,

2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:49.380
 is, the fact that we don't try to do something aggressively

2:29:49.380 --> 2:29:53.360
 about that dragon doesn't make any sense.

2:29:53.360 --> 2:29:58.360
 So you think this is a battle worth fighting,

2:29:58.560 --> 2:30:01.760
 a battle for immortality, or at least longevity?

2:30:01.760 --> 2:30:02.700
 I'd say absolutely.

2:30:02.700 --> 2:30:07.700
 And I'd say a battle where we really have started

2:30:07.760 --> 2:30:09.560
 over the last five years in particular

2:30:09.560 --> 2:30:13.000
 to see the first cracks of humanity

2:30:13.000 --> 2:30:16.080
 starting to make things that look like

2:30:16.080 --> 2:30:17.480
 they'll turn into victories.

2:30:18.600 --> 2:30:22.680
 Do you think humans can eventually live forever?

2:30:22.680 --> 2:30:26.120
 And maybe as a side comment to that,

2:30:26.120 --> 2:30:28.000
 what technology do you think will enable that

2:30:28.000 --> 2:30:29.960
 as a genetic modification?

2:30:29.960 --> 2:30:32.440
 Is it cloning, is it uploading your mind?

2:30:32.440 --> 2:30:34.680
 Define forever, like are we talking 1,000 years,

2:30:34.680 --> 2:30:38.480
 a million, 10 to the 14, 10 to the 45?

2:30:38.480 --> 2:30:40.520
 Well, let's start, as I tweeted today,

2:30:40.520 --> 2:30:43.040
 eventually everything, the universe will be filled

2:30:43.040 --> 2:30:44.740
 with supermassive black holes.

2:30:44.740 --> 2:30:49.120
 So that forever, maybe like backtracking to where.

2:30:49.120 --> 2:30:52.420
 We'll have 10 to the 16 years to figure it out.

2:30:52.420 --> 2:30:54.120
 Yes, exactly.

2:30:55.360 --> 2:30:59.920
 Yeah, maybe travel between the multiverse,

2:30:59.920 --> 2:31:02.920
 between the different universes of the multiverse.

2:31:02.920 --> 2:31:07.920
 I mean, but forever meaning like, you know, millennia.

2:31:11.640 --> 2:31:13.920
 I definitely think that we can get there.

2:31:13.920 --> 2:31:15.900
 I definitely think that it's the sort of thing

2:31:15.900 --> 2:31:19.280
 that's going to take an insanely huge amount of work.

2:31:19.280 --> 2:31:21.240
 And I definitely think it's the sort of thing

2:31:21.240 --> 2:31:24.760
 where once we figure out the first crop of problems

2:31:24.760 --> 2:31:27.640
 and like people start living to 150,

2:31:27.640 --> 2:31:29.680
 we'll just realize that there's like 10 other problems

2:31:29.680 --> 2:31:32.120
 that kill you half as slowly and we'll have to do more work.

2:31:32.120 --> 2:31:36.120
 But the good news is that this is Aubrey's longevity

2:31:36.120 --> 2:31:38.480
 escape velocity argument that if you get everyone

2:31:38.480 --> 2:31:41.400
 to live to 150 now, then you have half a century

2:31:41.400 --> 2:31:43.400
 to fix all those other problems as well.

2:31:44.320 --> 2:31:47.380
 So I'm optimistic for that reason.

2:31:47.380 --> 2:31:52.080
 I think you definitely do not want to underestimate

2:31:52.080 --> 2:31:54.480
 human ingenuity, especially over the longterm.

2:31:54.480 --> 2:31:56.400
 Like just to look at what happens to computers

2:31:56.400 --> 2:32:00.000
 between the ENIAC in 1950 and we're around 2020, right?

2:32:00.000 --> 2:32:02.720
 Like that's a span of 70 years.

2:32:02.720 --> 2:32:04.640
 So like, you know, both of us, I think,

2:32:04.640 --> 2:32:08.000
 with just present day technology,

2:32:08.000 --> 2:32:11.040
 I have like at least 70 more years to live.

2:32:11.040 --> 2:32:12.960
 So just like imagine what kind of sea change

2:32:12.960 --> 2:32:16.080
 will happen in biomedicine during that time.

2:32:16.080 --> 2:32:17.800
 And the other thing that made me optimistic

2:32:17.800 --> 2:32:22.480
 is that I actually think COVID has been this kind of event

2:32:22.480 --> 2:32:26.520
 that's really kind of pushed biomedicine

2:32:26.520 --> 2:32:29.800
 and especially like activist approaches to biomedicine

2:32:29.800 --> 2:32:32.420
 really into the public consciousness, right?

2:32:32.420 --> 2:32:36.200
 Like it basically, it's put people into this mindset

2:32:36.200 --> 2:32:37.840
 that, you know, wait, but like, you know,

2:32:37.840 --> 2:32:39.840
 it's not just like, you know, the bits and tweets

2:32:39.840 --> 2:32:41.880
 that are gonna save the world, you know,

2:32:41.880 --> 2:32:46.040
 the bio is actually like super important and huge.

2:32:46.040 --> 2:32:51.040
 And, you know, ultimately what's ending COVID basically,

2:32:51.960 --> 2:32:53.360
 you know, is the vaccines

2:32:53.360 --> 2:32:56.160
 and the vaccines have just been, you know, amazing.

2:32:56.160 --> 2:33:01.160
 And if you can take that energy and also like this,

2:33:03.360 --> 2:33:05.840
 I think philosophical attitude that I've noticed,

2:33:05.840 --> 2:33:07.580
 like the way that I would describe

2:33:07.580 --> 2:33:09.960
 the philosophical attitude here,

2:33:09.960 --> 2:33:12.000
 this is going more depth first,

2:33:12.000 --> 2:33:15.840
 is that I think the way that I kind of interpret

2:33:15.840 --> 2:33:19.560
 part of what I would call late 20th century ideology

2:33:19.560 --> 2:33:21.760
 is that there is this mentality that, you know,

2:33:21.760 --> 2:33:25.600
 nature is good and disruptions from nature are bad

2:33:25.600 --> 2:33:28.520
 and generally you wanna minimize disruptions from nature.

2:33:28.520 --> 2:33:31.160
 And like this exists everywhere in the political spectrum.

2:33:31.160 --> 2:33:33.280
 So there's nature as in literal nature.

2:33:33.280 --> 2:33:35.760
 And my view is that like the right wing version of that

2:33:35.760 --> 2:33:37.380
 is markets as nature, right?

2:33:37.380 --> 2:33:42.380
 Like, you know, the way that like that kind of philosophy

2:33:44.020 --> 2:33:45.940
 talks about, you know, markets

2:33:45.940 --> 2:33:48.260
 and like the goal of not interfering with them,

2:33:48.260 --> 2:33:51.380
 like, you know, it is very kind of like nature styled.

2:33:51.380 --> 2:33:53.860
 And then of course, you know, the conservative one,

2:33:53.860 --> 2:33:56.940
 which is like traditional culture that existed

2:33:56.940 --> 2:33:59.460
 before the activists started controlling everything

2:33:59.460 --> 2:34:01.940
 as also being a kind of nature.

2:34:01.940 --> 2:34:05.260
 But the 21st century attitude and like really COVID,

2:34:05.260 --> 2:34:08.620
 you know, has flipped a lot of minds

2:34:08.620 --> 2:34:10.820
 because with COVID what's happened is that,

2:34:10.820 --> 2:34:13.740
 well, no, like it's not, nature is not safe, right?

2:34:13.740 --> 2:34:17.340
 The default is that is like, you know, untold misery

2:34:17.340 --> 2:34:19.620
 and suffering in tens of millions of people dying.

2:34:19.620 --> 2:34:22.300
 The only way out for us is through

2:34:22.300 --> 2:34:25.820
 like basically human ingenuity.

2:34:25.820 --> 2:34:30.260
 And that frame of mind is one that's like much more friendly

2:34:30.260 --> 2:34:35.260
 to one, this other change of minds that I want to see,

2:34:36.260 --> 2:34:37.740
 which is like basically treating aging

2:34:37.740 --> 2:34:39.540
 as an engineering problem, right?

2:34:39.540 --> 2:34:43.300
 Like the default is all 7.8 billion human beings

2:34:43.300 --> 2:34:44.860
 that are currently on this earth are gonna die

2:34:44.860 --> 2:34:47.260
 and they're gonna live their last decade of life

2:34:47.260 --> 2:34:48.820
 in debilitating pain.

2:34:48.820 --> 2:34:51.900
 And the only way to stop that is human ingenuity.

2:34:51.900 --> 2:34:54.520
 And, you know, we don't have that solution yet,

2:34:54.520 --> 2:34:56.620
 but, you know, if we work hard, we will.

2:34:56.620 --> 2:34:58.680
 And more and more people on the biology side,

2:34:58.680 --> 2:35:00.780
 computational biology are basically converting

2:35:00.780 --> 2:35:05.340
 the mess of the human biology into an engineering problem.

2:35:05.340 --> 2:35:07.380
 And once that conversion is happening,

2:35:07.380 --> 2:35:09.860
 looking at the genetic code, the proteins,

2:35:09.860 --> 2:35:12.380
 all those kinds of things, once that conversion happens,

2:35:12.380 --> 2:35:15.340
 you can now apply the tools that we know

2:35:15.340 --> 2:35:18.140
 how to solve engineering problems to solving it that way.

2:35:18.140 --> 2:35:21.160
 And then there's also the other version, which is, you know,

2:35:21.160 --> 2:35:24.580
 why do we romanticize this meat vehicle

2:35:24.580 --> 2:35:28.500
 that ultimately is just the thing that carries the brain,

2:35:28.500 --> 2:35:30.460
 maybe we can more and more convert ourselves

2:35:30.460 --> 2:35:32.540
 into the digital realm.

2:35:32.540 --> 2:35:35.660
 This is where like Neuralink have the computer interfaces

2:35:35.660 --> 2:35:38.660
 and then achieve immortality in the space of information

2:35:38.660 --> 2:35:40.940
 and the digital space versus the biology space.

2:35:40.940 --> 2:35:42.660
 That stuff's interesting too, I agree.

2:35:42.660 --> 2:35:45.980
 Again, I think, you know, we have enough resources

2:35:45.980 --> 2:35:48.060
 and we should just try all the parallel tracks.

2:35:48.060 --> 2:35:50.260
 You know, it's great that we have people

2:35:50.260 --> 2:35:51.520
 just trying to make our bodies work.

2:35:51.520 --> 2:35:54.540
 It's great that we have people trying to upload

2:35:54.540 --> 2:35:56.560
 or improve brain scanning.

2:35:56.560 --> 2:35:58.500
 It's also great that we have just like people

2:35:58.500 --> 2:35:59.500
 improving cryonics.

2:35:59.500 --> 2:36:01.300
 So like we could just like, you know,

2:36:01.300 --> 2:36:04.140
 go to sleep in the freezer and eventually,

2:36:04.140 --> 2:36:06.620
 hopefully sometime in the future, you know,

2:36:06.620 --> 2:36:08.740
 Hal Finney is gonna be able to wake up,

2:36:08.740 --> 2:36:13.740
 all of this, you know, anyone who gets cryo chronically

2:36:13.740 --> 2:36:15.260
 frozen today will be able to wake up,

2:36:15.260 --> 2:36:17.300
 but you know, that's a bet, right?

2:36:17.300 --> 2:36:18.700
 That's the last resort.

2:36:18.700 --> 2:36:20.340
 And then the other interesting thing

2:36:20.340 --> 2:36:23.980
 about the like extreme uploading approach, right,

2:36:23.980 --> 2:36:27.300
 is we're excited about space.

2:36:27.300 --> 2:36:32.300
 And one of the points that a lot of science

2:36:32.620 --> 2:36:34.460
 or like hard science fiction types make

2:36:34.460 --> 2:36:36.000
 is that, you know, if you want to explore space,

2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:38.400
 that's a lot easier if you're not a human, right?

2:36:38.400 --> 2:36:40.820
 Like one example of this is that, you know,

2:36:40.820 --> 2:36:42.920
 in the context of humans, we're talking about like,

2:36:42.920 --> 2:36:44.340
 oh, we're gonna be able to go to the moon,

2:36:44.340 --> 2:36:46.180
 oh, we're gonna be able to go to Mars,

2:36:46.180 --> 2:36:49.580
 but there's this project called Starshot, I believe, right?

2:36:49.580 --> 2:36:52.900
 That's basically trying to send spacecraft

2:36:52.900 --> 2:36:55.220
 to mini spacecrafts to Alpha Centauri,

2:36:55.220 --> 2:36:58.180
 and they literally believe that they're going to be able

2:36:58.180 --> 2:37:00.020
 to get spacecraft over to Alpha Centauri

2:37:00.020 --> 2:37:03.440
 like four light years away by like the 2060s.

2:37:03.440 --> 2:37:04.280
 Now, I mean.

2:37:04.280 --> 2:37:05.540
 By traveling close to the speed of light, yeah.

2:37:05.540 --> 2:37:08.260
 Exactly, like, so the way it works is, you know,

2:37:08.260 --> 2:37:09.300
 you have these light sails,

2:37:09.300 --> 2:37:10.980
 like you basically take these a spacecraft

2:37:10.980 --> 2:37:12.380
 and you shine a laser at it,

2:37:12.380 --> 2:37:13.940
 and the laser is insanely strong,

2:37:13.940 --> 2:37:17.060
 quickly accelerated at a hundred Gs or,

2:37:17.060 --> 2:37:18.780
 no, I think it was 10,000 Gs

2:37:18.780 --> 2:37:20.900
 until it gets to 20% of the speed of light,

2:37:20.900 --> 2:37:22.940
 and then, you know, it goes on your merry way, right?

2:37:22.940 --> 2:37:26.060
 So if you wants to be in,

2:37:27.340 --> 2:37:30.100
 like personally explore the Alpha Centauri system

2:37:30.100 --> 2:37:33.600
 within like two centuries or one century,

2:37:33.600 --> 2:37:37.520
 then, you know, being a robot is like,

2:37:37.520 --> 2:37:39.380
 by far the most practical way to do it,

2:37:39.380 --> 2:37:40.820
 because there's no way that a human being

2:37:40.820 --> 2:37:42.480
 can survive 10,000 Gs.

2:37:42.480 --> 2:37:45.220
 So it's definitely interesting longterm,

2:37:45.220 --> 2:37:47.260
 but at the same time,

2:37:47.260 --> 2:37:50.060
 there's definitely a lot of like psychological hangups

2:37:50.060 --> 2:37:52.100
 and a lot of like deep philosophy

2:37:52.100 --> 2:37:55.660
 that we'll just have to grapple with to get there.

2:37:55.660 --> 2:37:57.940
 I think what it hangs on the topic

2:37:57.940 --> 2:37:59.900
 of whether we can convert consciousness

2:37:59.900 --> 2:38:01.420
 into an engineering problem.

2:38:01.420 --> 2:38:05.180
 So like, is consciousness tied to our biology?

2:38:05.180 --> 2:38:07.740
 Because the moment we can convert consciousness

2:38:07.740 --> 2:38:09.100
 into a digital form,

2:38:09.100 --> 2:38:11.860
 then we can send it with that light sail

2:38:11.860 --> 2:38:12.820
 to Alpha Centauri.

2:38:12.820 --> 2:38:16.380
 Until then, a robot is not carrying anything

2:38:16.380 --> 2:38:18.580
 except maybe some basic knowledge like Wikipedia.

2:38:18.580 --> 2:38:21.620
 It's not carrying the flame of human consciousness.

2:38:21.620 --> 2:38:25.580
 I have high hopes for converting consciousness

2:38:25.580 --> 2:38:27.460
 into an engineering problem.

2:38:27.460 --> 2:38:30.180
 In fact, I think it's not as difficult as people think.

2:38:30.180 --> 2:38:31.540
 I'm like, yeah, I agree with that.

2:38:31.540 --> 2:38:33.900
 I'm definitely in the camp that consciousness

2:38:33.900 --> 2:38:35.900
 is a property of the algorithm

2:38:35.900 --> 2:38:38.660
 and not a property of a brain structure.

2:38:38.660 --> 2:38:41.500
 The other fun, like the kinds of philosophical things

2:38:41.500 --> 2:38:43.700
 we'd have to grapple with is like,

2:38:43.700 --> 2:38:46.140
 once you upload yourself, like you can hit Control C,

2:38:46.140 --> 2:38:48.500
 you know, like it wouldn't be lovely

2:38:48.500 --> 2:38:50.740
 to have like 10 copies of Alex Friedman

2:38:50.740 --> 2:38:53.380
 and then like we could just interview everyone.

2:38:53.380 --> 2:38:56.180
 So this is, I mean, this is, I have to ask this question.

2:38:56.180 --> 2:38:57.380
 It's a difficult one,

2:38:57.380 --> 2:39:00.380
 which I don't think it'd be wonderful, first of all.

2:39:01.660 --> 2:39:02.500
 Sure.

2:39:02.500 --> 2:39:04.300
 So in the following way,

2:39:04.300 --> 2:39:06.340
 and this has to do with immortality as well,

2:39:06.340 --> 2:39:11.340
 there's something about scarcity that creates value.

2:39:11.460 --> 2:39:13.340
 Or there's a bunch of philosophers,

2:39:13.340 --> 2:39:16.260
 Viktor Frankl, Bernard Williams, Ernest Becker,

2:39:16.260 --> 2:39:20.140
 they argue that death or the scarcity of life

2:39:20.140 --> 2:39:21.380
 creates meaning.

2:39:21.380 --> 2:39:24.420
 The reason we, life is beautiful,

2:39:24.420 --> 2:39:27.660
 the reason so many moments of experience

2:39:27.660 --> 2:39:31.620
 of love or delicious food,

2:39:31.620 --> 2:39:34.460
 all those things are made delicious

2:39:34.460 --> 2:39:36.900
 because they're finite, because they end,

2:39:36.900 --> 2:39:39.620
 and because we don't have that many of them.

2:39:39.620 --> 2:39:40.940
 And there's a kind of worry

2:39:40.940 --> 2:39:43.780
 that if we extend the human lifespan,

2:39:43.780 --> 2:39:46.900
 if we achieve immortality, or if we, God forbid,

2:39:46.900 --> 2:39:51.380
 clone me multiple times,

2:39:51.380 --> 2:39:53.940
 then you lose the richness of what it means

2:39:53.940 --> 2:39:56.980
 to have this life, to have this experience.

2:39:56.980 --> 2:39:58.420
 Is that worry you at all?

2:39:58.420 --> 2:39:59.780
 Do you think there's some aspect

2:39:59.780 --> 2:40:02.780
 to which death does in fact give meaning to life?

2:40:02.780 --> 2:40:05.460
 I guess like the one historical parallel,

2:40:05.460 --> 2:40:06.900
 and this might be a bit unfair,

2:40:06.900 --> 2:40:09.060
 is that there have been philosophers

2:40:09.060 --> 2:40:11.340
 that have said things like,

2:40:11.340 --> 2:40:14.500
 war gives meaning to human collectives,

2:40:14.500 --> 2:40:18.860
 and the struggle for supremacy between nations and races

2:40:18.860 --> 2:40:21.060
 is this big driver of progress

2:40:21.060 --> 2:40:25.220
 that ensures that everyone strives to be their best.

2:40:25.220 --> 2:40:28.900
 And of course, this viewpoint got into the head

2:40:28.900 --> 2:40:30.940
 of a crazy Austrian guy, and 20 years later,

2:40:30.940 --> 2:40:33.260
 his soldiers were shooting at my grandparents.

2:40:33.260 --> 2:40:36.900
 So these days we don't really have that,

2:40:36.900 --> 2:40:39.500
 but yet life still feels meaningful.

2:40:39.500 --> 2:40:41.340
 We've still found other ways to,

2:40:43.900 --> 2:40:47.220
 there's still a striving for technological progress.

2:40:47.220 --> 2:40:52.220
 There's still a striving for self improvements in general.

2:40:52.740 --> 2:40:55.380
 And it turns out that you don't actually need

2:40:55.380 --> 2:40:58.780
 to have existential conflicts in order to have that.

2:40:58.780 --> 2:40:59.940
 Now, maybe you need conflict,

2:40:59.940 --> 2:41:01.300
 but we have other kinds of conflict, right?

2:41:01.300 --> 2:41:03.700
 Like we have competition between businesses,

2:41:03.700 --> 2:41:05.460
 competition between political ideologies,

2:41:05.460 --> 2:41:07.580
 competition between projects.

2:41:07.580 --> 2:41:12.580
 And so these are, like whatever the psychological needs are,

2:41:12.620 --> 2:41:14.500
 like they're just our substitutes for it.

2:41:14.500 --> 2:41:19.380
 So I guess like, yeah, so if we trying to say,

2:41:19.380 --> 2:41:24.380
 I feel like once we start living to the age of 200,

2:41:24.660 --> 2:41:27.220
 then like, I'm just intuitively expecting

2:41:27.220 --> 2:41:30.860
 that we'll see substitutes emerge in the same way.

2:41:31.700 --> 2:41:35.740
 Yeah, we'll create conflicts of other sorts

2:41:35.740 --> 2:41:38.900
 that lead to less human suffering than wars do.

2:41:38.900 --> 2:41:42.420
 Like we'll just start playing Diablo four, five, six,

2:41:42.420 --> 2:41:44.180
 cause you die in video games.

2:41:44.180 --> 2:41:48.460
 So maybe we'll get some of the inkling of scarcity

2:41:48.460 --> 2:41:50.420
 through the activities we partake in

2:41:50.420 --> 2:41:52.380
 as opposed to our own body dying.

2:41:52.380 --> 2:41:55.500
 I mean, I feel shitty when I, like you can,

2:41:55.500 --> 2:42:00.340
 I remember in Diablo three, you can play in hardcore mode

2:42:00.340 --> 2:42:03.140
 where if you die in the game, your character's dead.

2:42:03.140 --> 2:42:08.140
 Maybe we'll get the richness that we currently get from life

2:42:09.500 --> 2:42:11.940
 by having like little artificial versions

2:42:11.940 --> 2:42:12.940
 of ourselves that die.

2:42:12.940 --> 2:42:15.780
 Interesting enough, as I've just like personally

2:42:15.780 --> 2:42:18.180
 spent more time in this world, I've started realizing

2:42:18.180 --> 2:42:22.020
 that there is a concept of like real finiteness

2:42:22.020 --> 2:42:25.060
 that still exists and it might even still be a thing

2:42:25.060 --> 2:42:27.020
 that provides meaning that doesn't require anyone

2:42:27.020 --> 2:42:28.180
 to actually die.

2:42:28.180 --> 2:42:32.180
 Like for example, like how many people from middle school

2:42:32.180 --> 2:42:34.820
 or even high school are yours?

2:42:34.820 --> 2:42:36.660
 Like do you still talk to regularly?

2:42:36.660 --> 2:42:39.620
 I happen to be close friends with like four or five of them.

2:42:39.620 --> 2:42:41.500
 Okay, well, like in my case, the answer is zero

2:42:41.500 --> 2:42:43.060
 for middle school and two for high school.

2:42:43.060 --> 2:42:43.900
 But you're right.

2:42:43.900 --> 2:42:44.740
 Right.

2:42:44.740 --> 2:42:45.580
 It dropped close to zero.

2:42:45.580 --> 2:42:47.100
 Exactly, it dropped a lot, right?

2:42:47.100 --> 2:42:50.540
 And so like there's a lot of these just like relationships

2:42:50.540 --> 2:42:52.620
 that end up being very finite.

2:42:52.620 --> 2:42:56.420
 A person changes their, I feel like a person changes enough

2:42:56.420 --> 2:42:58.260
 of their worldview after 25 years.

2:42:58.260 --> 2:42:59.620
 Was there even a study about this?

2:42:59.620 --> 2:43:03.140
 Something like a person and themselves 25 years later

2:43:03.140 --> 2:43:06.700
 are about as different as like two different people

2:43:06.700 --> 2:43:08.020
 or something like this.

2:43:08.020 --> 2:43:10.940
 So, I mean, just like you can have conflict

2:43:10.940 --> 2:43:14.780
 without bloodshed, I think you can have finiteness

2:43:14.780 --> 2:43:18.580
 and even the necessary sorrows of finiteness

2:43:18.580 --> 2:43:21.420
 that give meaning without like literally anyone

2:43:21.420 --> 2:43:22.780
 having to end their life.

2:43:22.780 --> 2:43:24.660
 And hopefully if we do extend our life,

2:43:24.660 --> 2:43:27.980
 we'll figure out ways to extend the period of time

2:43:27.980 --> 2:43:30.340
 where there's neuroplasticity

2:43:30.340 --> 2:43:33.980
 to where we could change our worldviews continually

2:43:33.980 --> 2:43:34.820
 throughout that time.

2:43:34.820 --> 2:43:37.660
 So you can have these different phases of life.

2:43:38.860 --> 2:43:41.540
 I thought it would be fun to hear you speak a little Russian.

2:43:41.540 --> 2:43:42.460
 Do you speak Russian?

2:43:42.460 --> 2:43:44.260
 Yes, of course.

2:43:44.260 --> 2:43:48.420
 How did your Russian roots help you?

2:43:48.420 --> 2:43:50.660
 That's an interesting question.

2:43:50.660 --> 2:43:52.740
 What can you say in Russian about that?

2:43:52.740 --> 2:43:55.860
 What can I say about my Russian roots?

2:43:55.860 --> 2:44:03.700
 When I just look at other projects,

2:44:03.700 --> 2:44:07.820
 other people in the blockchain industry,

2:44:07.820 --> 2:44:12.620
 sometimes when I look at what Russian people are doing,

2:44:12.620 --> 2:44:14.300
 what other people are doing,

2:44:14.300 --> 2:44:21.180
 I can sometimes feel that these people who are Russian

2:44:21.180 --> 2:44:27.860
 have something that feels similar to me,

2:44:27.860 --> 2:44:32.220
 but I don't know how to explain it.

2:44:32.220 --> 2:44:35.620
 Do you think there's, so for people who don't speak Russian,

2:44:35.620 --> 2:44:40.860
 that Vitalik said that there is something to the spirit

2:44:40.860 --> 2:44:42.220
 of the people that are Russian

2:44:42.220 --> 2:44:44.940
 that are working in the cryptocurrency world

2:44:44.940 --> 2:44:46.820
 that is a little bit different

2:44:46.820 --> 2:44:51.300
 and it's something that connects to some kind of aspect

2:44:51.300 --> 2:44:54.500
 of your own self, some kind of roots there.

2:44:54.500 --> 2:44:56.580
 And it's kind of interesting.

2:44:56.580 --> 2:44:59.260
 Do you think that there's, does it make you sad

2:44:59.260 --> 2:45:01.660
 that there's these two different worlds

2:45:01.660 --> 2:45:07.420
 that are sort of in part disconnected by language?

2:45:07.420 --> 2:45:09.820
 And I'm sure the same could be the case with China

2:45:09.820 --> 2:45:11.660
 and other parts of the world,

2:45:11.660 --> 2:45:17.140
 where the language slows the transmission of the beauty

2:45:17.140 --> 2:45:19.340
 of the culture in a certain kind of way

2:45:19.340 --> 2:45:21.380
 where you can't truly collaborate.

2:45:21.380 --> 2:45:23.180
 Like you can all speak English,

2:45:23.180 --> 2:45:25.820
 so you're collaborating on maybe a technical level,

2:45:25.820 --> 2:45:28.380
 but you're not collaborating on the level

2:45:28.380 --> 2:45:30.660
 of some deep human connection.

2:45:30.660 --> 2:45:34.140
 Do you see that being able to speak both languages?

2:45:34.140 --> 2:45:35.860
 There's definitely benefits, I think,

2:45:35.860 --> 2:45:38.980
 to be able to speak multiple languages.

2:45:38.980 --> 2:45:44.980
 And once you can, you discover that even your mindset changes

2:45:44.980 --> 2:45:47.660
 while you're speaking in one language versus the other.

2:45:47.660 --> 2:45:50.460
 People have told me this, like, when I speak Russian,

2:45:50.460 --> 2:45:54.380
 I sound more, I guess, to the point and pragmatic.

2:45:54.380 --> 2:45:56.420
 When I speak Chinese, I sound more cute.

2:45:56.420 --> 2:46:00.940
 When I speak English, I'm something else.

2:46:00.940 --> 2:46:06.980
 I guess there's definitely a richness that you're missing

2:46:06.980 --> 2:46:10.580
 if you're only in one of these language bubbles.

2:46:10.580 --> 2:46:14.940
 But I guess the arguments on the other side would be that

2:46:14.940 --> 2:46:16.540
 if everyone spoke the same language,

2:46:16.540 --> 2:46:19.300
 then there would just be one bubble.

2:46:19.300 --> 2:46:22.500
 This is the challenge, I think.

2:46:22.500 --> 2:46:25.660
 There are actually benefits to having cultural diversity,

2:46:25.660 --> 2:46:27.540
 and you definitely don't want the entire world

2:46:27.540 --> 2:46:30.180
 to be too conformist.

2:46:30.180 --> 2:46:31.780
 Well, one of the interesting things about crypto

2:46:31.780 --> 2:46:34.780
 is that it's just a culture that actually manages

2:46:34.780 --> 2:46:40.180
 to somehow have its uniqueness and even preserve its independence

2:46:40.180 --> 2:46:42.940
 from all of these surrounding countries

2:46:42.940 --> 2:46:44.980
 despite being embedded in all of them.

2:46:44.980 --> 2:46:48.780
 So it spans outside of the geographic boundaries,

2:46:48.780 --> 2:46:51.020
 and language in some ways does as well.

2:46:51.020 --> 2:46:54.500
 And the way these cultures, these bubbles are created,

2:46:54.500 --> 2:46:56.300
 I mean, they overlap in interesting ways.

2:46:56.300 --> 2:46:57.420
 It's almost like a hierarchy,

2:46:57.420 --> 2:47:00.020
 and the same is the case of the crypto world.

2:47:00.020 --> 2:47:03.460
 There's communities associated with these cryptocurrencies.

2:47:03.460 --> 2:47:06.900
 There's communities within those communities, and it's...

2:47:06.900 --> 2:47:09.460
 Yeah, I mean, I think it's definitely sad

2:47:09.460 --> 2:47:13.420
 whenever these groups are fighting each other,

2:47:13.420 --> 2:47:19.780
 and it's definitely good for them if people can cooperate more.

2:47:19.780 --> 2:47:24.460
 But at the same time, just having groups of people

2:47:24.460 --> 2:47:27.740
 that have different kinds of life experiences,

2:47:27.740 --> 2:47:30.260
 there's definitely something to benefit from that.

2:47:30.260 --> 2:47:31.940
 So let me ask one last question.

2:47:31.940 --> 2:47:33.780
 I don't think I asked you last time

2:47:33.780 --> 2:47:37.140
 the ridiculous question about the meaning of life.

2:47:37.140 --> 2:47:38.380
 You know, Dostoevsky said,

2:47:38.380 --> 2:47:40.100
 beauty will save the world.

2:47:40.100 --> 2:47:43.820
 Krasata spacet mir.

2:47:43.820 --> 2:47:46.740
 Some people believe money is a big part of happiness,

2:47:46.740 --> 2:47:48.860
 and you've turned...

2:47:48.860 --> 2:47:50.340
 First of all, you've made a lot of money.

2:47:50.340 --> 2:47:51.820
 You turned away a lot of money.

2:47:51.820 --> 2:47:53.860
 You turned away a lot of power.

2:47:53.860 --> 2:47:56.220
 So you're a fascinating person to ask,

2:47:56.220 --> 2:47:59.580
 what do you think is meaning to life?

2:47:59.580 --> 2:48:01.300
 The thing that I've realized with money

2:48:01.300 --> 2:48:05.460
 as I have experienced both having little of it

2:48:05.460 --> 2:48:12.300
 and having a lot of it is that the benefit of...

2:48:12.300 --> 2:48:15.580
 You can get the most out of money if you think of it

2:48:15.580 --> 2:48:18.740
 not as something that lets you do and have more things,

2:48:18.740 --> 2:48:22.780
 but as something that lets you worry about fewer things, right?

2:48:22.780 --> 2:48:28.300
 Like, if your savings are just nonzero at all,

2:48:28.300 --> 2:48:31.220
 then you don't have to worry as much about losing your job.

2:48:31.220 --> 2:48:35.020
 And if you feel like you have a job

2:48:35.020 --> 2:48:36.900
 that just really conflicts with your values,

2:48:36.900 --> 2:48:39.020
 then if you have even six months saved up,

2:48:39.020 --> 2:48:40.420
 that just makes it easier for you to say,

2:48:40.420 --> 2:48:42.620
 bye bye, I'm going to do something else.

2:48:42.620 --> 2:48:49.620
 If you have more money, then you can not worry about

2:48:49.620 --> 2:48:53.620
 even what you're doing needing to be profitable at all.

2:48:53.620 --> 2:48:59.180
 Once you get more money, then you can choose transportation options

2:48:59.180 --> 2:49:02.420
 and food options that just have less hassle in your life

2:49:02.420 --> 2:49:04.300
 and allow you to be lazier.

2:49:04.300 --> 2:49:11.340
 So, this aspect of just reducing troubles

2:49:11.340 --> 2:49:16.180
 and opening up room for other things, I think, is a big part of it.

2:49:16.180 --> 2:49:20.140
 If you instead think of money as being this positive

2:49:20.140 --> 2:49:22.380
 or this thing that gives you stuff

2:49:22.380 --> 2:49:25.740
 and you try to derive meaning from the stuff,

2:49:25.740 --> 2:49:32.260
 I think that's much more likely to be a road to basically squandering that opportunity.

2:49:32.260 --> 2:49:38.380
 So, yeah, and I guess my philosophy on that is definitely more subtractive than additive there.

2:49:38.380 --> 2:49:41.660
 But once you have enough money that you don't have to worry about the money,

2:49:41.660 --> 2:49:45.980
 you're burdened with another question, which is of meaning.

2:49:45.980 --> 2:49:47.900
 Do you think there's meaning to it all?

2:49:47.900 --> 2:49:51.660
 Or it seems like your own life,

2:49:51.660 --> 2:49:59.220
 you're trying to build cool stuff that alleviates some level of suffering in the world.

2:49:59.220 --> 2:50:02.380
 Well, I mean, one way to think about it is like,

2:50:02.380 --> 2:50:06.540
 think back to how you thought about life when you were in school, right?

2:50:06.540 --> 2:50:09.020
 In school, this act is interesting to think about, right?

2:50:09.020 --> 2:50:16.300
 Because in a lot of ways, it's just totally outside of bounds of the kinds of systems,

2:50:16.300 --> 2:50:19.460
 like social systems that we live in as adults,

2:50:19.460 --> 2:50:23.540
 or maybe not, like maybe things like academia are intended to replicate parts of school.

2:50:23.540 --> 2:50:26.180
 Like, first of all, school is very totalitarian, right?

2:50:26.180 --> 2:50:30.500
 Like, you have to follow the teacher's instructions,

2:50:30.500 --> 2:50:33.780
 the bulk of your schedule is like forced to be in particular areas,

2:50:33.780 --> 2:50:43.420
 and you can control the real purview from leaving the grounds during this period of time,

2:50:43.420 --> 2:50:45.180
 assign a lot of homework.

2:50:45.180 --> 2:50:50.220
 But at the same time, also, school is a bit of a post scarcity utopia

2:50:50.220 --> 2:50:53.500
 in that you just don't have to worry about getting resources for yourself.

2:50:53.500 --> 2:50:57.660
 And we've both lived through 12 years of that, right?

2:50:57.660 --> 2:50:59.580
 So, what does that say about us?

2:50:59.580 --> 2:51:10.700
 And I think one thing of aspects, obviously, is that there's definitely an easiness to living life

2:51:10.700 --> 2:51:12.940
 if all of your decisions are made for you.

2:51:12.940 --> 2:51:20.140
 And one of the challenges of adulthood, I guess, is moving to this world

2:51:20.140 --> 2:51:22.860
 where all your choices are much more self directed,

2:51:22.860 --> 2:51:26.540
 and you just have to learn to live and deal with that.

2:51:26.540 --> 2:51:30.380
 Yeah, dealing with the burden of freedom, in some sense.

2:51:30.380 --> 2:51:38.780
 It's actually interesting, because in some ways, I feel like even my first five years

2:51:38.780 --> 2:51:43.420
 of doing Ethereum things, my life was not even all that self directed,

2:51:43.420 --> 2:51:47.420
 because a lot of it was just responding to obligations.

2:51:47.420 --> 2:51:51.020
 Like someone said, oh, come to speak at this event in Korea.

2:51:51.020 --> 2:51:52.940
 Okay, come to speak at this thing in Taiwan.

2:51:52.940 --> 2:51:53.440
 Okay.

2:51:55.660 --> 2:52:00.780
 For Ethereum to launch, we need this particular piece to be done and tested.

2:52:00.780 --> 2:52:01.820
 Okay, work on that.

2:52:01.820 --> 2:52:05.820
 We need some proof of stake algorithm, work on that.

2:52:05.820 --> 2:52:14.300
 And the last year of COVID life, basically, I was holed up in Singapore for much of it.

2:52:14.300 --> 2:52:16.620
 And it gave me a lot more alone time.

2:52:16.620 --> 2:52:18.060
 I had much less travel.

2:52:18.060 --> 2:52:21.500
 And that was definitely a very new and interesting experience for me.

2:52:21.500 --> 2:52:31.180
 Would you characterize it by sadness, melancholy, hope, dreaming, innovative period?

2:52:31.180 --> 2:52:33.260
 How would you characterize that alone time?

2:52:33.260 --> 2:52:36.220
 Some of all five, definitely some self discovery.

2:52:37.260 --> 2:52:43.420
 I definitely did make this very deliberate decision that, okay, I have this time,

2:52:43.420 --> 2:52:48.780
 and I'm going to actually make something meaningful out of it.

2:52:48.780 --> 2:52:52.780
 So one example of the things I did is I just actually started

2:52:53.980 --> 2:52:56.860
 listening to your audio books and podcasts much more.

2:52:57.580 --> 2:53:02.700
 Just this year, I basically discovered that the podcast space is real for the first time,

2:53:02.700 --> 2:53:03.500
 I guess.

2:53:03.500 --> 2:53:06.300
 Like before that, there would be things that I would get interviewed for,

2:53:06.300 --> 2:53:16.220
 but I was not mentally incorporate this idea that podcasts are a thing that you can go listen to.

2:53:16.220 --> 2:53:17.020
 And this year I did.

2:53:17.660 --> 2:53:24.380
 My friend, Carl Lafleur, one of the optimism people, recommended hardcore history to me.

2:53:24.380 --> 2:53:27.260
 And so I went ahead and just listened to all the hardcore histories.

2:53:27.260 --> 2:53:32.940
 And then after that, I listened to like 10 Luxfried mids and then a bunch of others.

2:53:32.940 --> 2:53:36.700
 And after that, I also got into audio books.

2:53:37.740 --> 2:53:43.660
 Oh, I listened to the entire The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, the whole thing, 45 hours.

2:53:44.460 --> 2:53:45.580
 That was fascinating.

2:53:45.580 --> 2:53:48.540
 So let me ask about Dan, because Dan is going to love hearing this.

2:53:48.540 --> 2:53:50.460
 I'm going to send it to him.

2:53:50.460 --> 2:53:54.220
 Do you have a period of history, whether it's Dan or in general,

2:53:54.220 --> 2:53:58.060
 that you draw for your own life, like kind of thinking about the world,

2:53:58.060 --> 2:53:59.900
 about human nature that you go to?

2:53:59.900 --> 2:54:01.100
 Is it World War II?

2:54:01.100 --> 2:54:04.940
 Is it Wrath of the Khans, the Genghis Khan?

2:54:05.420 --> 2:54:08.380
 Is it some other more ancient history?

2:54:08.380 --> 2:54:09.660
 Is it World War I?

2:54:09.660 --> 2:54:15.900
 Is there something that kind of echoes with you in the voice of Dan or anyone else that you connect to?

2:54:16.460 --> 2:54:21.660
 I feel like the 1930s and 40s are fascinating because they force you to really grapple with

2:54:21.660 --> 2:54:25.100
 the question of where does evil come from, right?

2:54:25.100 --> 2:54:31.100
 The sort of mental puzzle that I've always had in my head is, on the one hand,

2:54:31.740 --> 2:54:33.660
 things like the Holocaust happened.

2:54:33.660 --> 2:54:38.140
 But on the other hand, if you just go and have a coffee with people,

2:54:38.140 --> 2:54:41.180
 then a hundred times out of a hundred, everyone just seems so nice.

2:54:41.180 --> 2:54:43.900
 Yeah, exactly.

2:54:43.900 --> 2:54:47.580
 How do you kind of reconcile the macro and the micro there, right?

2:54:47.580 --> 2:54:56.540
 And that's the sort of thing that's very difficult if you don't have a lot of,

2:54:56.540 --> 2:54:58.940
 I guess, the right kind of personal experience,

2:54:58.940 --> 2:55:03.340
 especially if your personal experience starts off being sheltered, like it was for me, right?

2:55:03.340 --> 2:55:07.980
 I know the stereotype is that the nerds get bullied in school, but actually for me,

2:55:07.980 --> 2:55:11.020
 in my school experience was just being treated with kindness by everyone.

2:55:11.020 --> 2:55:11.520
 Yeah.

2:55:12.220 --> 2:55:15.820
 So that definitely made it harder to understand things.

2:55:15.820 --> 2:55:19.580
 I remember actually being pretty blindsided when I started Ethereum.

2:55:19.580 --> 2:55:24.460
 And then within six months, there started being fights over who would get more shares

2:55:24.460 --> 2:55:26.460
 if Ethereum turned out to be a company.

2:55:26.460 --> 2:55:29.100
 And then I suggested we should just make it to be a non profit,

2:55:29.100 --> 2:55:30.860
 and somehow that ended up upsetting people.

2:55:34.860 --> 2:55:40.620
 So the fascinating thing for me is that I've been obviously reading and listening to the history,

2:55:40.620 --> 2:55:45.020
 and then at the same time, just observing things happening in the crypto world.

2:55:45.020 --> 2:55:55.580
 And so one of my interesting mental intuitions that I've gotten is that I think most evil

2:55:55.580 --> 2:55:57.740
 doesn't come out of greed, it comes out of fear.

2:55:58.700 --> 2:56:08.220
 And one example of this in Ethereum lands, right, is I think the part of Ethereum history

2:56:08.220 --> 2:56:10.460
 where I thought that the Ethereum community was at its lowest,

2:56:10.460 --> 2:56:12.540
 and even when I personally was at my lowest.

2:56:12.540 --> 2:56:17.820
 Now, if you go back to the Dow fork in 2016, right, so the Dow hack happened,

2:56:17.820 --> 2:56:20.780
 and then we made this controversial decision to change the Ethereum protocol.

2:56:21.980 --> 2:56:28.300
 And then there was that Ethereum Classic split.

2:56:28.300 --> 2:56:34.860
 And as soon as that Ethereum Classic split happened, there was a lot of anger everywhere.

2:56:34.860 --> 2:56:41.420
 And there started especially being anger when the price of ETC started taking up.

2:56:41.420 --> 2:56:46.860
 So this was the time when Ether started off being $13 and Ethereum Classic started at zero,

2:56:46.860 --> 2:56:50.780
 but then suddenly there was this one day when like ETH dropped to 12.5,

2:56:50.780 --> 2:56:54.300
 ETC went up to 0.5, and then they dropped more.

2:56:55.100 --> 2:56:56.860
 And people were saying things like,

2:56:57.980 --> 2:57:03.900
 oh, this whole Ethereum Classic is just a psyop by the Bitcoin community

2:57:03.900 --> 2:57:06.300
 and just the wealthy Bitcoiners trying to destroy Ethereum.

2:57:06.860 --> 2:57:11.020
 And in the back of my mind, I knew that that wasn't entirely true.

2:57:11.020 --> 2:57:12.460
 There definitely were Bitcoiners.

2:57:12.460 --> 2:57:20.860
 But at the same time, I think blaming disagreements on foreign interference,

2:57:20.860 --> 2:57:25.180
 like this is the sort of thing that countries, governments do all the time,

2:57:25.820 --> 2:57:31.260
 it's a very convenient excuse because it allows you to just blame these things

2:57:31.260 --> 2:57:36.380
 that are happening on the foreigners and avoid actually grappling with the facts that like,

2:57:36.380 --> 2:57:38.860
 well, no, actually you have people in your very own community

2:57:38.860 --> 2:57:41.100
 who just disagree with you and have a different belief.

2:57:41.660 --> 2:57:46.540
 And I feel like the Ethereum community during that time

2:57:46.540 --> 2:57:48.780
 did not do a very good job of grappling with that.

2:57:48.780 --> 2:57:52.940
 And I feel like I during that time did not do a very good job of grappling with that.

2:57:52.940 --> 2:57:56.060
 And so there was a lot of blaming the Bitcoiners.

2:57:56.060 --> 2:58:00.460
 There were also even a lot of people calling for us to use trademark law

2:58:00.460 --> 2:58:05.660
 and basically sue exchanges and try to prevent them from listing Ethereum Classic.

2:58:05.660 --> 2:58:07.500
 And to me, that was very unethical, right?

2:58:07.500 --> 2:58:17.180
 Like basically using the government as a weapon to try to attack the other cryptocurrency

2:58:17.180 --> 2:58:21.420
 and destroy it goes completely against the ideals of freedom

2:58:21.420 --> 2:58:24.860
 and things that at least in theory were supposed to stand for.

2:58:25.580 --> 2:58:32.700
 But in that particular time, basically what was happening was that the ETC price was rising.

2:58:32.700 --> 2:58:36.060
 And at the same time, the ETH price was dropping in lockstep.

2:58:36.060 --> 2:58:40.140
 And there were a lot of Bitcoin people basically saying this is the end of Ethereum.

2:58:40.140 --> 2:58:42.780
 And I think a lot of people really were afraid that

2:58:42.780 --> 2:58:45.900
 Ethereum would be just like completely destroyed as a result of this.

2:58:45.900 --> 2:58:48.700
 And so that's where the anger came from.

2:58:48.700 --> 2:58:50.300
 Exactly. Yeah, exactly.

2:58:50.300 --> 2:58:51.260
 It came from the fear.

2:58:51.260 --> 2:58:56.940
 And that's what allowed people to rationalize in abandonment of principles

2:58:56.940 --> 2:59:01.740
 that I think they would not have accepted in other circumstances.

2:59:01.740 --> 2:59:06.700
 And I definitely, to some extent, played along with this myself.

2:59:06.700 --> 2:59:10.060
 And I do definitely regret that to some extent.

2:59:10.060 --> 2:59:14.140
 Well, I definitely regret the excesses completely.

2:59:17.020 --> 2:59:21.580
 And then obviously, Bitcoin block size war, similar sort of stuff happened.

2:59:21.580 --> 2:59:30.700
 So that insight was interesting because it does mentally make a lot of sense

2:59:30.700 --> 2:59:34.220
 when you're actually afraid that unless you act in some way

2:59:34.220 --> 2:59:36.300
 that your entire world is going to collapse.

2:59:36.300 --> 2:59:39.820
 It's much easier to just rationalize forgetting your principles

2:59:39.820 --> 2:59:43.340
 and doing whatever you have to just save the specific thing that you care about.

2:59:44.140 --> 2:59:50.940
 It feels like the right thing to do, the brave thing to do is in the face of fear

2:59:51.660 --> 2:59:56.780
 to still have compassion, to still have love as opposed to hate.

2:59:56.780 --> 3:00:01.500
 So the darkest moments, the toughest moments of human history

3:00:01.500 --> 3:00:03.900
 are those where fear is everywhere.

3:00:04.700 --> 3:00:14.860
 And despite that, the way to get out of that is through love, not giving into the fear.

3:00:14.860 --> 3:00:18.780
 And again, that's the lesson that you draw from all those moments of history.

3:00:20.540 --> 3:00:21.040
 Yeah.

3:00:21.660 --> 3:00:26.060
 Well, I like you have in terms of those coffee and the kindness that people have,

3:00:26.060 --> 3:00:29.340
 it does seem that everybody has the capacity for evil

3:00:29.340 --> 3:00:31.500
 and everybody has the capacity for love.

3:00:31.500 --> 3:00:34.460
 And you just have to create mechanisms and incentives

3:00:35.100 --> 3:00:37.820
 that prioritize the latter over the former.

3:00:38.380 --> 3:00:42.460
 Vitalik, you're one of the most interesting people I've gotten a chance to talk to.

3:00:44.060 --> 3:00:45.580
 Thank you so much for talking to me.

3:00:45.580 --> 3:00:47.500
 I hope we get a chance to talk again.

3:00:47.500 --> 3:00:50.220
 I hope I can at least be some small part.

3:00:50.220 --> 3:00:53.340
 This would be awesome in a podcast with you and Dan Carlin.

3:00:53.340 --> 3:00:56.380
 That would be an awesome conversation.

3:00:56.380 --> 3:01:01.100
 Thank you so much for doing so much incredible technical innovation

3:01:01.820 --> 3:01:05.900
 that inspires the computer scientists, the economists,

3:01:05.900 --> 3:01:08.860
 inspires the world and what technology can do.

3:01:08.860 --> 3:01:14.620
 And now with longevity, I do hope we live a very long time

3:01:14.620 --> 3:01:19.580
 and play Diablo to make that long time fun.

3:01:19.580 --> 3:01:20.860
 Thank you so much for talking today.

3:01:20.860 --> 3:01:21.580
 Thank you too, Alex.

3:01:21.580 --> 3:01:23.260
 This was great.

3:01:23.260 --> 3:01:26.060
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Vitalik Buterin

3:01:26.060 --> 3:01:29.420
 and thank you to Athletic Greens, Magic Spoon,

3:01:29.420 --> 3:01:32.860
 Indeed, Four Sigmatic and BetterHelp.

3:01:32.860 --> 3:01:35.580
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

3:01:36.620 --> 3:01:39.900
 And now let me leave you with some words from Nelson Mandela.

3:01:40.780 --> 3:01:44.540
 When a man is denied the right to live the life he believes in,

3:01:44.540 --> 3:01:47.820
 he has no choice but to become an outlaw.

3:01:47.820 --> 3:01:50.940
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
