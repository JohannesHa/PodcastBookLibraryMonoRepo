00:00.000 --> 00:04.900
 The following is a conversation with Clara Souza Silva, a quantum astrochemist at Harvard

00:04.900 --> 00:11.520
 specializing in spectroscopy of gases that serve as possible signs of life on other planets,

00:11.520 --> 00:14.340
 most especially the gas phosphine.

00:14.340 --> 00:20.560
 She was a coauthor of the paper that in 2020 found that there is phosphine in the atmosphere

00:20.560 --> 00:26.920
 of Venus and, thus, possible extraterrestrial life that lives in its atmosphere.

00:26.920 --> 00:31.320
 The detection of phosphine was challenged, reaffirmed, and is now still under active

00:31.320 --> 00:32.720
 research.

00:32.720 --> 00:38.000
 Quick mention of our sponsors, Onnit, Grammarly, Blinkist, and Indeed.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.440
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:41.440 --> 00:45.520
 As a side note, let me say that I think the search for life on other planets is one of

00:45.520 --> 00:47.560
 the most important endeavors in science.

00:47.560 --> 00:53.240
 If we find extraterrestrial life and study it, we may find insights into the mechanisms

00:53.240 --> 00:58.240
 that originated life here on Earth, and more than life, the mechanisms that originated

00:58.240 --> 01:00.800
 intelligence and consciousness.

01:00.800 --> 01:04.360
 If we understand these mechanisms, we can build them.

01:04.360 --> 01:09.100
 But more than this, the discovery of life on other planets means that our galaxy and

01:09.100 --> 01:11.960
 our universe is teeming with life.

01:11.960 --> 01:15.980
 This is humbling and terrifying, but it is also exciting.

01:15.980 --> 01:17.940
 We humans are natural explorers.

01:17.940 --> 01:22.880
 For most of our history, we explored the surface of the Earth and the contents of our minds.

01:22.880 --> 01:27.960
 But now, with spacefaring vessels, we have a chance to explore life beyond Earth, their

01:27.960 --> 01:33.300
 physics, their biology, and perhaps the contents of their minds.

01:33.300 --> 01:40.120
 This is the Lux Friedman Podcast, and here is my conversation with Clara Souza Silva.

01:40.120 --> 01:45.960
 Since you're the world expert in, well, in many things, but one of them is phosphine,

01:45.960 --> 01:52.840
 would it technically be correct to call you the queen of phosphine?

01:52.840 --> 01:54.640
 I go for Dr. Phosphine.

01:54.640 --> 01:57.000
 Queen is an inherited title, I feel.

01:57.000 --> 02:05.760
 But you still rule by love and power, so, but while having the doctor title, I got it.

02:05.760 --> 02:06.760
 Kindness.

02:06.760 --> 02:07.760
 Kindness.

02:07.760 --> 02:08.760
 Kindness.

02:08.760 --> 02:13.400
 In September 2020, you coauthored a paper announcing possible presence of phosphine

02:13.400 --> 02:21.120
 in the atmosphere of Venus, and that it may be a signature of extraterrestrial life.

02:21.120 --> 02:22.120
 Big maybe.

02:22.120 --> 02:23.120
 Big maybe.

02:23.120 --> 02:29.080
 There was some pushback, of course, from the scientific community that followed, friendly,

02:29.080 --> 02:31.940
 loving pushback.

02:31.940 --> 02:37.540
 Then in January, another paper from University of Wisconsin, I believe, confirmed the finding.

02:37.540 --> 02:44.440
 So where do we stand in this saga, in this mystery of what the heck is going on, on Venus

02:44.440 --> 02:46.880
 in terms of phosphine and in terms of aliens?

02:46.880 --> 02:50.720
 Let's try to break it down.

02:50.720 --> 02:53.920
 The short answer is we don't know.

02:53.920 --> 02:59.200
 I think you and the rest of the public are now witnessing a pretty exciting discovery,

02:59.200 --> 03:07.520
 but as it evolves, as it unfolds, we did not wait until we had, you know, years of

03:07.520 --> 03:14.080
 data from 10 different instruments across several layers of the atmosphere.

03:14.080 --> 03:21.480
 We waited until we had two telescopes with independent data months apart, but still,

03:21.480 --> 03:23.100
 the data is weak.

03:23.100 --> 03:24.100
 It's noisy.

03:24.100 --> 03:25.100
 It's delicate.

03:25.100 --> 03:31.480
 It's very much at the edge of instrument sensitivity, sensitivity, and so we still don't even know

03:31.480 --> 03:33.080
 if it is phosphine.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.660
 We don't even really know if the signal is real.

03:35.660 --> 03:37.560
 People still disagree about that.

03:37.560 --> 03:44.400
 I think at the more philosophical end of how this happened, I think it is a distinction,

03:44.400 --> 03:49.600
 and myself and other coauthors were talking about this, it's a distinction between hypothesis

03:49.600 --> 03:52.560
 generation and hypothesis testing.

03:52.560 --> 04:01.160
 Now hypothesis testing is something that I think is the backbone of the scientific method,

04:01.160 --> 04:05.040
 but it has a problem, which is if you're looking through very noisy data and you want to test

04:05.040 --> 04:10.960
 the hypothesis, you may by mistake create a spurious signal.

04:10.960 --> 04:14.720
 The safest, more conservative approach is hypothesis generation.

04:14.720 --> 04:17.500
 You see some data and you go, what's in there?

04:17.500 --> 04:18.500
 With no bias.

04:18.500 --> 04:24.000
 Now this is much safer, much more conservative, and when there's a lot of data, that's great.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.360
 When there isn't, you can clean the noise and take out the signal with it.

04:28.360 --> 04:33.280
 The signal with a bath water, whatever the equivalent of the analogy would be.

04:33.280 --> 04:37.400
 And so I think the healthy discourse that you described is exactly this.

04:37.400 --> 04:41.720
 There are ways of processing the data, completely legitimate ways, checked by multiple people

04:41.720 --> 04:47.800
 and experts where the signal shows up and then phosphine is in the atmosphere of Venus,

04:47.800 --> 04:52.420
 and some where it doesn't, and then we disagree what that signal means.

04:52.420 --> 04:58.420
 If it's real and it is an ambiguously phosphine, it is very exciting because we don't know

04:58.420 --> 05:05.960
 how to explain it without life, but going from there to Venusians is still a huge jump.

05:05.960 --> 05:06.960
 And so...

05:06.960 --> 05:07.960
 Venusians.

05:07.960 --> 05:12.920
 So that would be the title for the civilization, if it is a living and thriving on Venus's

05:12.920 --> 05:14.480
 Venusians.

05:14.480 --> 05:18.600
 Until we know what they call themselves and that's the name, yes.

05:18.600 --> 05:25.040
 So this is the early analysis of data or analysis of early data.

05:25.040 --> 05:30.000
 It was nevertheless, you waited until the actual peer reviewed publication to know?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
 Of course.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.220
 And analysis of the two different instruments months apart.

05:33.220 --> 05:35.840
 So that's ALMA and JCMT, the two telescopes.

05:35.840 --> 05:39.540
 I mean, it's still, I mean, it's really exciting.

05:39.540 --> 05:42.520
 What did it feel like sort of sitting on this data?

05:42.520 --> 05:50.480
 Like kind of anticipating the publication and wondering and still wondering, is it true?

05:50.480 --> 05:55.560
 Like how does it make you feel that a planet in our solar system might have phosphine in

05:55.560 --> 05:56.560
 the atmosphere?

05:56.560 --> 05:57.560
 It's nuts.

05:57.560 --> 06:01.360
 It's absolutely nuts.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.360
 I mean...

06:02.360 --> 06:04.360
 In the best possible way?

06:04.360 --> 06:08.080
 I've been working on phosphine for over a decade.

06:08.080 --> 06:10.160
 Before it was cool.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.640
 Way before it was cool.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.640
 Before anyone could spell it or heard of it.

06:15.640 --> 06:21.120
 And at the time people either didn't know what phosphine was or only knew it for being

06:21.120 --> 06:26.880
 just possibly the most horrendous molecule that ever graced the earth.

06:26.880 --> 06:30.660
 And so no one was a fan.

06:30.660 --> 06:34.740
 And I had been considering looking for it because I did think it was an unusual and

06:34.740 --> 06:37.480
 disgusting but very promising sign of life.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.040
 I've been looking for it everywhere.

06:40.040 --> 06:42.280
 I really didn't think to look in the solar system.

06:42.280 --> 06:49.280
 I thought it was all pretty rough around here for life.

06:49.280 --> 06:53.760
 And so I wasn't even considering the solar system at all, never mind next door Venus.

06:53.760 --> 06:58.800
 It was only the lead author of the study, Jane Greaves, who thought to look in the clouds

06:58.800 --> 07:05.380
 of Venus and then reached out to me to say, I don't know phosphine but I know it's weird.

07:05.380 --> 07:06.920
 How weird is it?

07:06.920 --> 07:09.060
 And the answer is very weird.

07:09.060 --> 07:12.400
 And so the telescopes we're looking at, this is visual data.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.560
 That's what I mean by visual.

07:14.560 --> 07:15.560
 You wouldn't see the phosphine.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.920
 Well, but I mean it's a telescope.

07:18.920 --> 07:19.920
 It's remote.

07:19.920 --> 07:20.920
 It's remote.

07:20.920 --> 07:27.480
 You're observing, you're what zooming in on this particular planet and what does the sensor

07:27.480 --> 07:28.920
 actually look like?

07:28.920 --> 07:30.760
 How many pixels are there?

07:30.760 --> 07:32.840
 What does the data kind of look like?

07:32.840 --> 07:39.640
 It'd be nice to kind of build up intuition of how little data we have based on which,

07:39.640 --> 07:44.640
 I mean, if you look at like, I've just been reading a lot about gravitational waves and

07:44.640 --> 07:50.600
 it's kind of incredible how from just very little, like probably the world's most precise

07:50.600 --> 07:57.600
 instrument, we can derive some very foundational ideas about our early universe.

07:57.600 --> 08:01.360
 And in that same way, it's kind of incredible how much data, how much information you can

08:01.360 --> 08:03.200
 get from just a few pixels.

08:03.200 --> 08:10.880
 So what are we talking about here in terms of based on which this paper saw possible

08:10.880 --> 08:13.700
 signs of phosphine in the atmosphere?

08:13.700 --> 08:18.400
 So phosphine, like every other molecule has a unique spectroscopic fingerprint, meaning

08:18.400 --> 08:21.860
 it rotates and it vibrates in special ways.

08:21.860 --> 08:28.620
 I calculated how many of those ways it can rotate and vibrate, 16.8 billion ways.

08:28.620 --> 08:33.360
 What this means is that if you look at the spectrum of light and that light has gone

08:33.360 --> 08:41.840
 through phosphine gas on the other end, there should be 16.8 billion tiny marks left, indentations

08:41.840 --> 08:43.960
 left in that spectrum.

08:43.960 --> 08:49.000
 We found one of those on Venus, one of those 16.8 billion.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.760
 So now the game is, can we find any of the other ones?

08:53.760 --> 08:55.200
 But they're really hard to spot.

08:55.200 --> 08:59.800
 They're all in terrible places in the electromagnetic spectrum.

08:59.800 --> 09:04.440
 And the instruments we use to find this one can't really find any other one.

09:04.440 --> 09:08.820
 There's another one of the 16.8 billion we could find, but it would take many, many days

09:08.820 --> 09:14.560
 of continuous observations and that's not really in the cards right now.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.760
 There's all kinds of noise, first of all.

09:16.760 --> 09:20.920
 There's all kinds of other signal.

09:20.920 --> 09:28.760
 So how do you separate all of that out to pull out just this particular signature that's

09:28.760 --> 09:31.120
 associated with phosphine?

09:31.120 --> 09:36.760
 So the data kind of looks somewhat like a wave and a lot of that is noise and it's a

09:36.760 --> 09:37.880
 baseline.

09:37.880 --> 09:42.120
 And so if you can figure out the exact shape of the wave, you can cancel that shape out

09:42.120 --> 09:46.840
 and you should be left with a straight line and if there's something there, an absorption,

09:46.840 --> 09:47.840
 so a signal.

09:47.840 --> 09:49.580
 So that's what we did.

09:49.580 --> 09:54.880
 We tried to find out what was this baseline shape, cleaned it out and got the signal.

09:54.880 --> 09:55.880
 That's part of the problem.

09:55.880 --> 09:59.040
 If you do this wrong, you can create a signal.

09:59.040 --> 10:07.000
 But that signal is at 8.904 wave numbers and we actually have more digits than that, but

10:07.000 --> 10:08.560
 I don't remember by heart.

10:08.560 --> 10:14.600
 And ALMA in particular is a very, very good telescope, array of telescopes and it can

10:14.600 --> 10:16.960
 focus on exactly that frequency.

10:16.960 --> 10:22.520
 And in that frequency, there are only two known molecules that absorb it all.

10:22.520 --> 10:23.520
 So that's how we do it.

10:23.520 --> 10:30.280
 We look at that exact spot where we know phosphine absorbs the other molecules SO2.

10:30.280 --> 10:36.460
 If there is extraterrestrial life, whether it's on Venus or on exoplanets where you

10:36.460 --> 10:40.560
 looked before, how does that make you feel?

10:40.560 --> 10:42.400
 How should it make us feel?

10:42.400 --> 10:43.480
 Should we be scared?

10:43.480 --> 10:46.160
 Should we be excited?

10:46.160 --> 10:48.040
 Let's say it's not intelligent life.

10:48.040 --> 10:51.760
 Let's say it's microbial life.

10:51.760 --> 10:53.000
 Is it a threat to us?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.120
 Are we a threat to it?

10:55.120 --> 11:00.920
 Or is it only, not only, but mostly a possibility to understand something fundamental, something

11:00.920 --> 11:04.400
 beautiful about life in the universe?

11:04.400 --> 11:05.400
 Hard to know.

11:05.400 --> 11:11.640
 You would have to bring on a poet or a philosopher on the show.

11:11.640 --> 11:12.640
 I feel those things.

11:12.640 --> 11:14.880
 I just don't know if those are the right things to feel.

11:14.880 --> 11:16.520
 I certainly don't feel scared.

11:16.520 --> 11:19.240
 I think it's rather silly to feel scared.

11:19.240 --> 11:21.140
 Definitely don't touch them.

11:21.140 --> 11:24.920
 Sometimes in movies, don't go near it.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.200
 Don't interfere.

11:26.200 --> 11:33.940
 I think one of the things with Venus is because of phosphine, now there is a chance that Venus

11:33.940 --> 11:34.940
 is inhabited.

11:34.940 --> 11:39.020
 And in that case, we shouldn't go there.

11:39.020 --> 11:46.480
 We should be very careful with messing with them, bringing our own stuff there that contaminates

11:46.480 --> 11:48.240
 it.

11:48.240 --> 11:49.720
 And Venus has suffered enough.

11:49.720 --> 11:56.160
 If there's life there, it's probably the remains of a living planet, the very last survivors

11:56.160 --> 12:00.920
 of what once was potentially a thriving world.

12:00.920 --> 12:06.720
 And so I don't want our first interaction with alien life to be a massacre.

12:06.720 --> 12:12.160
 So I definitely wouldn't want to go near out of a, let's say, galactic responsibility,

12:12.160 --> 12:14.400
 galactic ethics.

12:14.400 --> 12:19.620
 And I often think of alien astronomers watching us and how disappointed they would be if we

12:19.620 --> 12:20.620
 messed this up.

12:20.620 --> 12:25.960
 So I really want to be very careful with anything that could be life.

12:25.960 --> 12:28.320
 But certainly I wouldn't be scared.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.360
 Humans are plenty capable of killing one another.

12:30.360 --> 12:34.760
 We don't need extraterrestrial help to destroy ourselves.

12:34.760 --> 12:36.120
 Scared mostly of other humans.

12:36.120 --> 12:37.120
 Exactly.

12:37.120 --> 12:41.600
 But these, this life, if there is life there, it does seem just like you said, it would

12:41.600 --> 12:43.200
 be pretty rugged.

12:43.200 --> 12:47.200
 It's like the cockroaches or Chuck Norris, I don't know.

12:47.200 --> 12:53.120
 It's the, some kind of, it's something that survived through some very difficult conditions.

12:53.120 --> 12:58.160
 That doesn't mean it would handle us, you know, it could be like war of the worlds.

12:58.160 --> 13:02.440
 You come, just because you're resilient in your own planet doesn't mean you can survive

13:02.440 --> 13:03.440
 another.

13:03.440 --> 13:08.520
 The extremophiles, which are very impressive, we should all be very proud of our extremophiles.

13:08.520 --> 13:12.000
 They wouldn't really make it in the Venusian clouds.

13:12.000 --> 13:18.080
 So I wouldn't expect, because you're tough, even Chuck Norris tough, that you would survive

13:18.080 --> 13:20.800
 on an alien planet.

13:20.800 --> 13:25.520
 And then from the scientific perspective, you don't want to pollute the data gathering

13:25.520 --> 13:27.960
 process by showing up there.

13:27.960 --> 13:31.240
 The observer can affect the observed.

13:31.240 --> 13:35.360
 How heartbreaking would it be if we found life on another planet and then we're like,

13:35.360 --> 13:37.080
 oh, we brought it with us.

13:37.080 --> 13:38.320
 It was my sandwich.

13:38.320 --> 13:40.520
 But that's always the problem, right?

13:40.520 --> 13:47.280
 And it's certainly a problem with Mars because we've visited the, if there is life on Mars

13:47.280 --> 13:52.320
 or like remains of life on Mars, it's always going to be a question of like, well, maybe

13:52.320 --> 13:53.680
 we planted it there.

13:53.680 --> 13:55.060
 Let's not do the same with Venus.

13:55.060 --> 13:59.200
 It's harder because when we try to go to Venus, things melt very quickly.

13:59.200 --> 14:04.160
 So it's a little harder to pollute Venus.

14:04.160 --> 14:06.760
 It's very good at destroying foreigners.

14:06.760 --> 14:07.760
 Yeah.

14:07.760 --> 14:13.880
 Well, in terms of Elon Musk and terraforming planets, Mars is stop number one, then Venus

14:13.880 --> 14:15.480
 maybe after that.

14:15.480 --> 14:19.080
 So can we talk about phosphine a little bit?

14:19.080 --> 14:20.560
 So you mentioned it's a pretty...

14:20.560 --> 14:21.560
 Love talking about phosphine.

14:21.560 --> 14:22.560
 Love phosphine.

14:22.560 --> 14:23.560
 What's your Twitter handle?

14:23.560 --> 14:24.560
 It's like Dr. Phosphine.

14:24.560 --> 14:25.560
 It's Dr. Phosphine.

14:25.560 --> 14:26.560
 Yes.

14:26.560 --> 14:27.560
 You will be surprised here.

14:27.560 --> 14:28.560
 It wasn't taken already.

14:28.560 --> 14:29.560
 I just grabbed it.

14:29.560 --> 14:32.560
 I didn't have to buy it off anyone.

14:32.560 --> 14:33.560
 Yeah.

14:33.560 --> 14:35.320
 So what is it?

14:35.320 --> 14:36.320
 What's phosphine?

14:36.320 --> 14:43.560
 You already mentioned it's pretty toxic and troublesome and outside, troublesome, sorry.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.240
 No, I love it.

14:45.240 --> 14:48.860
 I'm going to stop calling it troublesome.

14:48.860 --> 14:56.560
 So maybe what are some things that make it interesting chemically and why is it a good

14:56.560 --> 15:00.440
 sign of life when it's present in the atmosphere?

15:00.440 --> 15:06.120
 Like you've described in your paper, aptly titled the phosphine as a biosignature gas

15:06.120 --> 15:08.320
 in exoplanet atmospheres.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.960
 I suppose you wrote that paper before Venus.

15:10.960 --> 15:11.960
 I did.

15:11.960 --> 15:12.960
 Yes.

15:12.960 --> 15:13.960
 I did.

15:13.960 --> 15:14.960
 And no one cared.

15:14.960 --> 15:19.280
 In that paper, I said something like, if we find phosphine on any terrestrial planet can

15:19.280 --> 15:20.280
 only mean life.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.680
 And everyone's like, yeah, that sounds about right.

15:21.680 --> 15:22.680
 Let's go.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.440
 And then Venus shows up and I was like, are you sure?

15:24.440 --> 15:27.720
 I'm like, I was sure before I was sure.

15:27.720 --> 15:35.900
 Now that it's right here, I'm less sure now that my claims are being tested.

15:35.900 --> 15:38.680
 So phosphine, phosphine is a fascinating molecule.

15:38.680 --> 15:43.920
 So it's shaped like a pyramid with a phosphorus up top and then three hydrogens.

15:43.920 --> 15:49.240
 It's actually quite a simple molecule in many ways and you know, it's the most popular elements

15:49.240 --> 15:54.920
 in the universe, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur.

15:54.920 --> 16:00.080
 When you add hydrogen to them, it makes quite simple, quite famous molecules.

16:00.080 --> 16:04.360
 You do it to oxygen, you get water, you do it to carbon, you get methane, you do it to

16:04.360 --> 16:06.260
 nitrogen, you get ammonia.

16:06.260 --> 16:11.560
 These are all molecules people have heard of, but you do it to phosphorus, you get phosphine.

16:11.560 --> 16:16.560
 People haven't heard of phosphine because it's not really popular on earth.

16:16.560 --> 16:22.400
 You really shouldn't find it anywhere on earth because it is extremely toxic to life.

16:22.400 --> 16:30.600
 It interacts with oxygen metabolism and everything you know and love uses oxygen metabolism and

16:30.600 --> 16:31.840
 it interacts fatally.

16:31.840 --> 16:37.740
 So it kills in several very imaginative and very macabre ways.

16:37.740 --> 16:43.040
 So it was used as a chemical warfare agent in the first world war and most recently by

16:43.040 --> 16:44.040
 ISIS.

16:44.040 --> 16:46.100
 So really bad.

16:46.100 --> 16:48.220
 Most life avoids it.

16:48.220 --> 16:51.940
 Even life that might not avoid it, so life that doesn't use oxygen metabolism, anaerobic

16:51.940 --> 16:56.180
 life still has to put crazy amounts of effort into making it.

16:56.180 --> 16:59.440
 It's a really difficult molecule to make, thermodynamically speaking.

16:59.440 --> 17:04.220
 It's really difficult to make that phosphorus want to be together with that hydrogen.

17:04.220 --> 17:07.040
 So it's horrible.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.040
 Everyone avoids it.

17:08.040 --> 17:10.520
 When they're not avoiding it, it's extremely difficult to make.

17:10.520 --> 17:14.160
 You would have to put energy in, sacrifice energy to make it.

17:14.160 --> 17:19.660
 And if you did go through all that trouble and made it, it gets reacted with the radicals

17:19.660 --> 17:22.320
 in the atmosphere and gets destroyed.

17:22.320 --> 17:24.480
 So we shouldn't find it anywhere and yet we do.

17:24.480 --> 17:30.740
 This is kind of weird molecule that seems to be made by life and we don't even know

17:30.740 --> 17:31.780
 why.

17:31.780 --> 17:33.680
 Life clearly finds a use for it.

17:33.680 --> 17:37.620
 It's not the only molecule that life is willing to sacrifice energy to make, but we don't

17:37.620 --> 17:39.860
 know how or why life is even making it.

17:39.860 --> 17:46.340
 So absolutely mysterious, absolutely deadly, smells horrifically.

17:46.340 --> 17:50.580
 When it's made, it produces other kind of diphosphenes and it's been reported as smelling

17:50.580 --> 17:54.060
 like garlicky, fishy death.

17:54.060 --> 17:58.140
 Once someone referred to it as smelling like the, let me see if I remember, the rancid

17:58.140 --> 18:00.140
 diapers of the spawn of Satan.

18:00.140 --> 18:01.620
 Oh, very nice.

18:01.620 --> 18:03.620
 Yeah, very vivid.

18:03.620 --> 18:04.620
 And so...

18:04.620 --> 18:05.620
 You're a poet after all.

18:05.620 --> 18:08.180
 I didn't call it that, someone else did.

18:08.180 --> 18:12.700
 And so it's just this horrific molecule, but it is produced by life.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.220
 We don't know why.

18:14.220 --> 18:18.780
 And when it is produced by life, it's done with enormous sacrifice and the universe does

18:18.780 --> 18:22.460
 not sacrifice, life sacrifices.

18:22.460 --> 18:27.920
 And so it's this strange, contradictory molecule that we should all be avoiding and yet seems

18:27.920 --> 18:31.500
 to be an almost an ambiguous sign of life on rocky planets.

18:31.500 --> 18:32.500
 Okay.

18:32.500 --> 18:34.660
 Can we dig into that a little bit?

18:34.660 --> 18:43.900
 So on rocky planets, is there biological mechanisms that can produce it?

18:43.900 --> 18:50.340
 You said that why is unclear, why life might produce it, but is there an understanding

18:50.340 --> 18:54.260
 of what kind of mechanisms might be able to produce it, this very difficult to produce

18:54.260 --> 18:55.260
 molecule?

18:55.260 --> 18:57.220
 We don't know yet.

18:57.220 --> 19:02.060
 The enzymatic pathways of phosphine production by life are not yet known.

19:02.060 --> 19:04.420
 This is not actually as surprising as it might sound.

19:04.420 --> 19:10.300
 I think something like 80% of all the natural products that we know of, so we know biology

19:10.300 --> 19:11.580
 makes them.

19:11.580 --> 19:12.580
 We don't know how.

19:12.580 --> 19:17.340
 It is much easier to know life produces something because you can put bacteria in a Petri dish

19:17.340 --> 19:21.300
 and then watch and then that gas is produced, you go, oh, life made it.

19:21.300 --> 19:23.460
 That actually happened with phosphine.

19:23.460 --> 19:29.380
 But that's much easier to do of course, than figuring out what is the exact metabolic pathway

19:29.380 --> 19:33.100
 within that life form that created this molecule.

19:33.100 --> 19:35.340
 So we don't know yet.

19:35.340 --> 19:38.140
 Phosphine is really understudied.

19:38.140 --> 19:40.700
 No one had really heard of it until nowish.

19:40.700 --> 19:46.200
 What you were presenting is the fact that life produces phosphine, not the process by

19:46.200 --> 19:47.780
 which it produces phosphine.

19:47.780 --> 19:49.980
 Is there an urgency now?

19:49.980 --> 19:55.420
 Like if you were to try to understand the mechanisms, the, what did you call them, enzymatic

19:55.420 --> 20:00.380
 pathways that produce phosphine, how difficult is that of a problem to crack?

20:00.380 --> 20:01.380
 It's really difficult.

20:01.380 --> 20:08.740
 If I'm not mistaken, even the scent of truffles, obviously a billion dollar industry, huge

20:08.740 --> 20:09.740
 deal.

20:09.740 --> 20:14.340
 Until quite recently, it wasn't known exactly how those scents, those molecules that create

20:14.340 --> 20:16.500
 this incredible smell were produced.

20:16.500 --> 20:17.980
 This is a billion dollar industry.

20:17.980 --> 20:21.060
 As you can imagine, there is no such pressure.

20:21.060 --> 20:26.420
 There's no phosphine lobby or anything that would push for this research, but I hope someone

20:26.420 --> 20:29.100
 picks it up and does it.

20:29.100 --> 20:33.620
 And it isn't crazy because we know that phosphine is really hard to make.

20:33.620 --> 20:36.620
 We know it's really hard for it to happen accidentally.

20:36.620 --> 20:41.920
 Even lightning and volcanoes that can produce small amounts of phosphine, it's extremely

20:41.920 --> 20:44.740
 difficult for even these extreme processes to make it.

20:44.740 --> 20:49.260
 So it's not really surprising that only life can do it because life is willing to make

20:49.260 --> 20:52.180
 things at a cost.

20:52.180 --> 20:58.780
 So maybe on the topic of phosphine, what, again, you've gotten yourself into trouble.

20:58.780 --> 21:01.300
 I'm going to ask you all these high level poetic questions.

21:01.300 --> 21:02.300
 I apologize.

21:02.300 --> 21:04.700
 No, I would love it.

21:04.700 --> 21:05.700
 Okay.

21:05.700 --> 21:09.980
 When did you first fall in love with phosphine?

21:09.980 --> 21:11.500
 It wasn't love at first sight.

21:11.500 --> 21:20.460
 It was somewhere between a long relationship and Stockholm syndrome.

21:20.460 --> 21:25.500
 When I first started my PhD, I knew I wanted to learn about molecular spectra and how to

21:25.500 --> 21:26.500
 simulate it.

21:26.500 --> 21:32.220
 I thought it was really outrageous that we as a species couldn't detect molecules remotely.

21:32.220 --> 21:36.660
 We didn't have this perfect catalog ready of the molecular fingerprint of every molecule

21:36.660 --> 21:39.000
 we may want to find in the universe.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.580
 And something as basic as phosphine, the fact that we didn't really know how it interacted

21:43.580 --> 21:50.100
 with light and so we couldn't detect it properly in the galaxy, I was so indignant.

21:50.100 --> 21:55.900
 And so initially I just started working on phosphine because people hadn't before.

21:55.900 --> 22:01.260
 And I thought we should know what phosphine looks like and that was it.

22:01.260 --> 22:04.340
 And then I read every paper that's ever been published about phosphine.

22:04.340 --> 22:07.780
 It was quite easy because there aren't that many.

22:07.780 --> 22:13.300
 And that's when I started learning about where we had already found it in the universe and

22:13.300 --> 22:15.380
 what it meant.

22:15.380 --> 22:20.380
 I started finding out quite how little we know about it and why.

22:20.380 --> 22:27.820
 And it was only when I joined MIT and I started talking to biochemists that it became clear

22:27.820 --> 22:33.480
 that phosphine wasn't just weird and special and understudied and disgusting.

22:33.480 --> 22:37.020
 It was all these things for oxygen loving life.

22:37.020 --> 22:42.780
 And it was the anaerobic world that would welcome phosphine and that's when the idea

22:42.780 --> 22:46.540
 of looking for it on other planets became crystallized.

22:46.540 --> 22:52.340
 Because oxygen is very powerful and very important on Earth but that's not necessarily going

22:52.340 --> 22:54.360
 to be the case on other exoplanets.

22:54.360 --> 22:59.820
 Most planets are oxygen poor, overwhelmingly most planets are oxygen poor.

22:59.820 --> 23:06.180
 And so finding the sign of life that would be welcomed by everything that would live

23:06.180 --> 23:12.700
 without oxygen on Earth seemed so cool.

23:12.700 --> 23:16.820
 But ultimately the project at first was born out of the idea that you want to find that

23:16.820 --> 23:22.460
 molecular fingerprint of a molecule.

23:22.460 --> 23:24.860
 And this is just one example.

23:24.860 --> 23:33.620
 And that's connected to then looking for that fingerprint elsewhere in a remote way.

23:33.620 --> 23:37.780
 And obviously that then at that time where exoplanets already, when you were doing your

23:37.780 --> 23:41.180
 PhD, and by the way you should say your PhD thesis was on phosphine.

23:41.180 --> 23:45.700
 It was all on phosphine, 100% on phosphine with a little bit of ammonia.

23:45.700 --> 23:51.300
 I have a chapter that I did where I talked about phosphine and ammonia.

23:51.300 --> 23:55.500
 But no, phosphine was very much my thesis.

23:55.500 --> 24:01.020
 But at that time when you're writing it there's already a sense that exoplanets are out there

24:01.020 --> 24:08.420
 and we might be able to be looking for biosignatures on those exoplanets?

24:08.420 --> 24:09.420
 Pretty much.

24:09.420 --> 24:11.580
 I did my PhD in 2015.

24:11.580 --> 24:15.780
 We found the first exoplanets in the kind of mid to late 90s.

24:15.780 --> 24:17.620
 So exoplanets were known.

24:17.620 --> 24:22.380
 It was known that some had atmospheres and from there it's not a big jump to think, well,

24:22.380 --> 24:30.180
 if some have atmospheres, some of those might be habitable and some of those may be inhabited.

24:30.180 --> 24:35.100
 So how do you detect, you started to talk about it, but can we linger on it?

24:35.100 --> 24:43.000
 How do you detect phosphine on a faraway thing, rocky thing, rocky planet?

24:43.000 --> 24:45.880
 What is spectroscopy?

24:45.880 --> 24:47.820
 What is this molecular fingerprint?

24:47.820 --> 24:49.420
 What does it look like?

24:49.420 --> 24:52.980
 You've kind of mentioned the wave, but what are we supposed to think about?

24:52.980 --> 24:53.980
 What are the tools?

24:53.980 --> 24:55.860
 What are the uncertainties?

24:55.860 --> 24:57.380
 All those kinds of things.

24:57.380 --> 24:59.780
 So the path can go this way.

24:59.780 --> 25:03.840
 You've got light, kind of pure light.

25:03.840 --> 25:10.620
 You can crack that light open with a prism or a spectroscope or water and make a rainbow.

25:10.620 --> 25:17.460
 That rainbow is all the colors and all the invisible colors, the ultraviolet, the infrared.

25:17.460 --> 25:22.800
 And if that light was truly pure, you could consider that rainbow to just cover continuously

25:22.800 --> 25:24.820
 all of these colors.

25:24.820 --> 25:28.140
 But if that light goes through a gas, we may not see that gas.

25:28.140 --> 25:33.180
 We certainly cannot see the molecules within that gas, but those molecules will steal,

25:33.180 --> 25:38.300
 absorb some of that light, some, but not all.

25:38.300 --> 25:42.840
 Each molecule absorbs only very specific colors of that rainbow.

25:42.840 --> 25:48.420
 And so if you know, for example, that shade of green can only be absorbed by methane,

25:48.420 --> 25:49.420
 then you can watch.

25:49.420 --> 25:54.400
 As a planet passes in front of a star, the planet's too far away, you can't see it.

25:54.400 --> 25:55.400
 And it has an atmosphere.

25:55.400 --> 25:58.900
 That atmosphere is far too small, you definitely can't see it.

25:58.900 --> 26:01.280
 But the sunlight will go through that atmosphere.

26:01.280 --> 26:06.340
 And if that atmosphere is methane, then on the other side, that shade of blue, I can't

26:06.340 --> 26:11.960
 remember if I said blue or green, that color will be missing because methane took it.

26:11.960 --> 26:14.540
 And so with phosphine, it's the same thing.

26:14.540 --> 26:22.020
 It has specific colors, 16.8 billion colors that it absorbs it and nothing else does.

26:22.020 --> 26:28.060
 And so if you can find them and notice them missing from the light of a star that went

26:28.060 --> 26:33.260
 through a planet's atmosphere, then you'll know that atmosphere contains the molecule.

26:33.260 --> 26:34.260
 How cool is that?

26:34.260 --> 26:35.260
 That's incredible.

26:35.260 --> 26:40.820
 So you can have this fingerprint within the space of colors and there's a lot of molecules.

26:40.820 --> 26:45.060
 And I mean, I wonder, that's a question of like how much overlap there is.

26:45.060 --> 26:48.300
 How close can you get to the actual fingerprint?

26:48.300 --> 26:52.220
 Like can phosphine unlock the iPhone with its lights on?

26:52.220 --> 27:00.020
 You said 16.8 billion, so presumably this rainbow is discretized into little segments

27:00.020 --> 27:01.020
 somehow.

27:01.020 --> 27:02.020
 Exactly.

27:02.020 --> 27:03.980
 How many total are there?

27:03.980 --> 27:06.700
 How a lot is 16.8 billion?

27:06.700 --> 27:07.940
 It's a lot.

27:07.940 --> 27:14.340
 We don't have the instruments to break these, break any light into this many tiny segments.

27:14.340 --> 27:19.060
 And so with the instruments we do have, there's huge amounts of overlap.

27:19.060 --> 27:27.660
 As an example, a lot of the ways it's detectable is because the carbon and the hydrogens, they

27:27.660 --> 27:30.700
 vibrate with one another, they move, they interact.

27:30.700 --> 27:38.460
 But every other hydrocarbon, acetylene, isoprene has carbon and hydrogens also vibrating and

27:38.460 --> 27:39.460
 rotating.

27:39.460 --> 27:44.540
 And so it's actually very hard to tell them apart at low resolutions and our instruments

27:44.540 --> 27:50.260
 can't really cope with distinguishing between molecules particularly well.

27:50.260 --> 27:55.460
 But in an ideal world, if we had infinite resolution, then yes, every molecule's spectral

27:55.460 --> 27:57.580
 features will be unique.

27:57.580 --> 28:01.780
 Yeah, like almost too unique, like it would be too trivial.

28:01.780 --> 28:04.220
 At the quantum level, they're unique.

28:04.220 --> 28:07.100
 At our level, there's huge overlap.

28:07.100 --> 28:08.100
 Yeah.

28:08.100 --> 28:16.860
 So you can start to then try to disambiguate the fact that certain colors are missing,

28:16.860 --> 28:18.080
 what does that mean?

28:18.080 --> 28:21.740
 And hopefully they're missing in a certain kind of pattern where you can say with some

28:21.740 --> 28:24.460
 kind of probability, there's this gas, not this gas.

28:24.460 --> 28:28.460
 So you're solving that gaseous puzzle.

28:28.460 --> 28:29.460
 I got it.

28:29.460 --> 28:30.460
 Okay.

28:30.460 --> 28:31.720
 We can go back to Venus actually and show that.

28:31.720 --> 28:36.460
 So with this, I mentioned those two molecules that could be responsible for that signal,

28:36.460 --> 28:37.780
 the resolution that we have.

28:37.780 --> 28:43.180
 It was phosphine and SO2, sulfur dioxide.

28:43.180 --> 28:47.780
 And that resolution could really be one of the other, but in the same bandwidth, so in

28:47.780 --> 28:52.440
 the kind of the same observations, there was another region where phosphine does not absorb,

28:52.440 --> 28:55.180
 we know that, but SO2 does.

28:55.180 --> 28:58.660
 So we just went and checked and there was no signal.

28:58.660 --> 29:01.980
 So we thought, oh, then it must be phosphine.

29:01.980 --> 29:05.620
 And then we submitted the paper.

29:05.620 --> 29:06.620
 The rest is history.

29:06.620 --> 29:07.620
 I got it.

29:07.620 --> 29:13.220
 Well, yeah, that's beautifully told.

29:13.220 --> 29:18.180
 Is there, so the telescopes we're talking about are sitting on earth.

29:18.180 --> 29:26.260
 What can it help solving this fingerprint, molecular fingerprint problem if we do a flyby?

29:26.260 --> 29:31.760
 Does it help if you get closer and closer or are telescopes pretty damn good for this

29:31.760 --> 29:34.340
 kind of puzzle solving?

29:34.340 --> 29:37.780
 Telescopes are pretty good, but the earth's atmosphere is a pain.

29:37.780 --> 29:43.540
 I mean, I'm very thankful for it, but it does interrupt a lot of measurements and a lot

29:43.540 --> 29:47.260
 of regions where phosphine would be active, they are not available.

29:47.260 --> 29:52.300
 The earth is not transparent in those wavelengths.

29:52.300 --> 29:55.380
 So being above the atmosphere would make a huge difference.

29:55.380 --> 30:00.580
 Then proximity matters a lot less, but just escaping the earth's atmosphere would be wonderful.

30:00.580 --> 30:06.220
 But then it's really hard to stay very stable and if there is phosphine on Venus, there's

30:06.220 --> 30:08.700
 very little of it in the clouds.

30:08.700 --> 30:15.580
 And so the signal is very weak and the telescopes we can use on earth are much bigger and much

30:15.580 --> 30:16.740
 more stable.

30:16.740 --> 30:18.500
 So it's a bit of a trade off.

30:18.500 --> 30:24.620
 So is it, are you comfortable with this kind of remote observation?

30:24.620 --> 30:32.820
 Is it at all helpful to strive for going over to Venus and like grabbing a scoop of the

30:32.820 --> 30:39.260
 atmosphere or is remote observation really a powerful tool for this kind of job?

30:39.260 --> 30:41.900
 Like the scoop is not necessary.

30:41.900 --> 30:44.820
 Well a lot of people want to scoop, I get it.

30:44.820 --> 30:45.820
 I get it completely.

30:45.820 --> 30:47.380
 That's my natural inclination, yeah.

30:47.380 --> 30:51.860
 I don't want to scoop specifically because if it is life, I want to know everything I

30:51.860 --> 30:55.660
 can remotely before I interfere.

30:55.660 --> 30:59.660
 So that's my, I've got ethical reasons against the scoop more than engineering reasons against

30:59.660 --> 31:00.660
 the scoop.

31:00.660 --> 31:03.380
 But I have some engineering reasons against the scoop.

31:03.380 --> 31:10.000
 Scoop is not a technical term, but I feel like now it's too late to take it back.

31:10.000 --> 31:14.380
 We don't understand the clouds well enough to plan the scoop very well.

31:14.380 --> 31:18.900
 Because it's not that saturated, like there's not that much of it present.

31:18.900 --> 31:21.780
 No, and the place is nasty.

31:21.780 --> 31:28.220
 You know, it's not going to be easy to build something that can do the task reliably and

31:28.220 --> 31:33.220
 can be trusted, the measurements can be trusted and then pass that message on.

31:33.220 --> 31:35.500
 So actually I'm for an orbiter.

31:35.500 --> 31:40.420
 I think we should have orbiters around every solar system body whose job is just to learn

31:40.420 --> 31:42.180
 about these places.

31:42.180 --> 31:47.100
 I'm disappointed we haven't already got an orbiter around every single one of them.

31:47.100 --> 31:49.420
 A small, it can be a small satellite.

31:49.420 --> 31:52.220
 Getting data, figuring out, you know, how do the clouds move?

31:52.220 --> 31:53.300
 What's in them?

31:53.300 --> 31:56.220
 How often is there lightning and volcanic activity?

31:56.220 --> 31:57.220
 Where's the topography?

31:57.220 --> 31:58.980
 Is it changing?

31:58.980 --> 32:02.020
 Is there a biosphere actively doing things?

32:02.020 --> 32:05.020
 We should be monitoring this from afar.

32:05.020 --> 32:11.500
 And so I'm for over the atmosphere, hopefully around Venus, that would be, that would be

32:11.500 --> 32:12.500
 my choice.

32:12.500 --> 32:13.500
 Okay.

32:13.500 --> 32:19.260
 So now recently Venus is all exciting about a phosphine and everything.

32:19.260 --> 32:25.260
 Is there other stuff maybe before we were looking at Venus or now looking out into other

32:25.260 --> 32:26.980
 solar systems?

32:26.980 --> 32:32.900
 Is there other promising exoplanets or other planets within the solar system that might

32:32.900 --> 32:40.700
 have phosphine or might have other strong biosignatures that we should be looking for

32:40.700 --> 32:41.700
 like phosphine?

32:41.700 --> 32:48.380
 There's a few, but outside the solar system, all are kind of promising candidates.

32:48.380 --> 32:49.940
 We know so little about them.

32:49.940 --> 32:53.880
 For most of them, we barely know their density.

32:53.880 --> 32:57.900
 Most of them, we don't even know if they have an atmosphere, nevermind what that atmosphere

32:57.900 --> 32:59.260
 might contain.

32:59.260 --> 33:03.960
 So we're still very much at the stage where we have detected promising planets, but they're

33:03.960 --> 33:08.700
 promising in that they're about the right size, about the right density.

33:08.700 --> 33:13.180
 They could have an atmosphere and they're about the right distance from their host star.

33:13.180 --> 33:15.180
 But that's really all we know.

33:15.180 --> 33:20.780
 Near future telescopes will tell us much more, but for now we're just guessing.

33:20.780 --> 33:25.660
 So you said near future, so there's hope that there'll be telescopes that can see that far

33:25.660 --> 33:31.460
 enough to determine if there's an atmosphere and perhaps even the contents of that atmosphere?

33:31.460 --> 33:32.460
 Absolutely.

33:32.460 --> 33:39.380
 JWST, launching later this year, will be able to get a very rough sense of the main atmospheric

33:39.380 --> 33:44.380
 constituents of planets that could potentially be habitable.

33:44.380 --> 33:46.060
 And that's this year.

33:46.060 --> 33:47.060
 What's the name?

33:47.060 --> 33:49.660
 JWST, the James Webb Space Telescope.

33:49.660 --> 33:50.660
 Okay.

33:50.660 --> 33:53.060
 And that's going to be out in space, past the atmosphere.

33:53.060 --> 33:54.060
 Yes.

33:54.060 --> 33:57.300
 Is there something interesting to be said about the engineering aspect of the telescope?

33:57.300 --> 34:02.940
 I mean, it's an incredible beast, but it's a beast of many burdens.

34:02.940 --> 34:05.580
 So it's going to do, it's going to.

34:05.580 --> 34:07.300
 See, you are a poet.

34:07.300 --> 34:08.720
 You are, yeah.

34:08.720 --> 34:09.720
 I love it.

34:09.720 --> 34:10.720
 This is very eloquent.

34:10.720 --> 34:15.300
 You're speaking to the audience, which I appreciate.

34:15.300 --> 34:20.700
 So yeah, so it's a giant engineering project and is it orbiting something, do you know?

34:20.700 --> 34:26.220
 So it's going to be above the atmosphere and it will be doing lots of different astrophysics.

34:26.220 --> 34:33.180
 And so some of its time will be dedicated to exoplanets, but there's an entire astronomy

34:33.180 --> 34:40.340
 field fighting for time before the cryogenic lifetime of the instrument.

34:40.340 --> 34:45.980
 And so when I was looking for the possibility of finding phosphine on distant exoplanets,

34:45.980 --> 34:52.500
 I used JWST as a way of checking with this instrument that we will launch later this

34:52.500 --> 34:56.740
 year, could we detect phosphine on an oxygen poor planet?

34:56.740 --> 35:02.140
 And there I put very much a hard stop where some of my simulation said, yes, you can totally

35:02.140 --> 35:07.020
 do it, but it will take a little under the cryogenic lifetime of this machine.

35:07.020 --> 35:11.960
 So then I had to go, well, that's not going to, no one's going to dedicate all of JWST

35:11.960 --> 35:15.420
 to look for my molecule that no one cared about.

35:15.420 --> 35:21.200
 So we're very much at that edge, but there'll be many other telescopes in the coming decades

35:21.200 --> 35:26.060
 that will be able to tell us quite a lot about the atmospheres of potentially habitable planets.

35:26.060 --> 35:28.400
 So you mentioned simulation.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.220
 This is super interesting to me.

35:30.220 --> 35:36.860
 And this perhaps could be a super dumb question, but I think I haven't been able to, I haven't

35:36.860 --> 35:38.940
 been able to prove you wrong on that one.

35:38.940 --> 35:43.660
 You simulate molecules to understand how they look from a distance is what I understand.

35:43.660 --> 35:46.740
 Like what does that simulation look like?

35:46.740 --> 35:52.160
 So it's talking about which colors that the rainbow will be missing.

35:52.160 --> 35:54.740
 Is that the goal of the simulation?

35:54.740 --> 35:59.620
 That's the goal, but it's really just a very, very nasty Schrodinger's equation.

35:59.620 --> 36:01.100
 So it's a quantum simulation.

36:01.100 --> 36:03.780
 Oh, so it's simulating at the quantum level.

36:03.780 --> 36:04.780
 Yes.

36:04.780 --> 36:05.780
 So I'm a quantum astrochemist.

36:05.780 --> 36:07.180
 Hi, I'm Clara.

36:07.180 --> 36:08.180
 I'm a quantum astrochemist.

36:08.180 --> 36:10.300
 That's how we should have started this conversation.

36:10.300 --> 36:17.340
 Can you describe the three components of that quantum astro and chemist and how they interplay

36:17.340 --> 36:18.920
 together?

36:18.920 --> 36:26.060
 So I study the quantum behavior of molecules, hence the quantum and the chemist specifically

36:26.060 --> 36:31.120
 so I can detect them in space, hence the astro.

36:31.120 --> 36:38.620
 So what I do is I figure out the probability of a molecule being in a particular state.

36:38.620 --> 36:45.220
 There's no deterministic nature to the work I do, so it's every transition is just a likelihood.

36:45.220 --> 36:50.640
 But if you get a population of that molecule, it will always happen.

36:50.640 --> 36:52.460
 And so this is all at the quantum level.

36:52.460 --> 36:55.860
 It's a Schrodinger equation on, I think, 27 dimensions.

36:55.860 --> 36:57.880
 I don't remember it by heart.

36:57.880 --> 37:03.660
 And what this means is I'm solving these giant quantum matrices.

37:03.660 --> 37:09.060
 And that's why you need a lot of computer power, giant computers, to diagonalize these

37:09.060 --> 37:17.440
 enormous matrices, each of whom describes a single vibrational behavior of a molecule.

37:17.440 --> 37:26.120
 So I think phosphine has 17.5 million possible states it can exist in.

37:26.120 --> 37:31.160
 And transitions can occur between pairs of these states, and there's a certain likelihood

37:31.160 --> 37:32.160
 that they'll happen.

37:32.160 --> 37:33.160
 This is the quantum world.

37:33.160 --> 37:34.160
 Nothing is deterministic.

37:34.160 --> 37:38.560
 There's just a likelihood that it will jump from one state to another.

37:38.560 --> 37:44.220
 And these jumps, they're transitions, and there's 16.8 billion of them.

37:44.220 --> 37:48.980
 When energy is absorbed, that corresponds to this transition, we see it in the spectrum.

37:48.980 --> 37:50.700
 This is more quantum chemistry than you had asked for.

37:50.700 --> 37:51.700
 I'm sorry.

37:51.700 --> 37:52.700
 No, no.

37:52.700 --> 37:53.700
 I'm sorry.

37:53.700 --> 37:54.700
 Brain's broken.

37:54.700 --> 37:59.840
 So when the transitions happen between the different states, somehow the energy maps

37:59.840 --> 38:00.840
 the spectrum.

38:00.840 --> 38:01.840
 Exactly.

38:01.840 --> 38:06.760
 Energy corresponds to a frequency, and a frequency corresponds to a wavelength, which corresponds

38:06.760 --> 38:08.180
 to a color.

38:08.180 --> 38:11.800
 So there's some probability assigned to each color then?

38:11.800 --> 38:12.800
 Exactly.

38:12.800 --> 38:17.060
 And that probability determines how intense that transition will be, how strong.

38:17.060 --> 38:23.280
 And so you run this kind of simulation for particular, so that's 17.5 squared or something

38:23.280 --> 38:24.280
 like that.

38:24.280 --> 38:30.600
 So 15.5 million energies, each one of whom involves diagonalizing a giant matrix with

38:30.600 --> 38:31.600
 a supercomputer.

38:31.600 --> 38:36.960
 I wonder what the most efficient algorithm for diagonalization is, but there's some kind

38:36.960 --> 38:37.960
 of...

38:37.960 --> 38:38.960
 There's many.

38:38.960 --> 38:41.840
 Depends on kind of the shape of the matrix.

38:41.840 --> 38:43.600
 So they're not random matrices.

38:43.600 --> 38:48.580
 So some are more diagonal than others, and so some need more treatment than others.

38:48.580 --> 38:52.960
 Most of the work ends up going in describing the system, this quantum system in different

38:52.960 --> 38:57.560
 ways until you have a matrix that is close to being diagonal, and then it's much easier

38:57.560 --> 38:59.480
 to clean it up.

38:59.480 --> 39:03.840
 So how hard is this puzzle?

39:03.840 --> 39:08.400
 So you're solving this puzzle for phosphine, right?

39:08.400 --> 39:09.400
 Is this...

39:09.400 --> 39:12.240
 Are we supposed to solve this puzzle for every single molecule?

39:12.240 --> 39:13.240
 Exactly.

39:13.240 --> 39:14.240
 Oh boy.

39:14.240 --> 39:20.320
 Yes, I calculated if I did the work I did for phosphine, again, for all the molecules

39:20.320 --> 39:25.040
 for which we don't have spectra, for which we don't have a fingerprint, it would take

39:25.040 --> 39:28.560
 me 62,000 years, a little over.

39:28.560 --> 39:30.080
 62,000 years.

39:30.080 --> 39:31.960
 What time flies when you're having fun?

39:31.960 --> 39:32.960
 Okay.

39:32.960 --> 39:38.320
 But you write that there are about 16,000 molecules we care about when looking for a

39:38.320 --> 39:43.040
 new Earth or when we try to detect alien biosignatures.

39:43.040 --> 39:48.720
 If we want to detect any molecules from here, we need to know their spectra, and we currently

39:48.720 --> 39:49.720
 don't.

39:49.720 --> 39:53.000
 So to solve this particular problem, that's my job.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
 What was that?

39:54.000 --> 39:55.880
 I mean, that's absolutely correct.

39:55.880 --> 39:57.880
 I could have not said it better myself.

39:57.880 --> 39:59.360
 Did you take that from my website?

39:59.360 --> 40:00.800
 Yeah, I think I stole it.

40:00.800 --> 40:04.680
 And your website is excellent, so it's a worthy place to steal stuff from.

40:04.680 --> 40:05.680
 Thank you.

40:05.680 --> 40:12.120
 How do you solve this problem for the 16,000 molecules we care about, of which phosphine

40:12.120 --> 40:13.120
 is one?

40:13.120 --> 40:14.120
 Yes.

40:14.120 --> 40:21.360
 So, taking a step a little bit out of phosphine, is there...

40:21.360 --> 40:23.480
 Well, we were having so much fun.

40:23.480 --> 40:24.480
 We were having so much fun.

40:24.480 --> 40:25.480
 No, no, we're not saying bye.

40:25.480 --> 40:26.480
 No, no, no.

40:26.480 --> 40:27.480
 It's sticking around.

40:27.480 --> 40:30.720
 I'm just saying we're joining, more friends coming to the party.

40:30.720 --> 40:35.440
 How do you choose other friends to come to the party that are interesting to study as

40:35.440 --> 40:40.280
 we solve one puzzle at a time through the space of 16,000?

40:40.280 --> 40:41.280
 So we've already started.

40:41.280 --> 40:46.840
 Out of those 16,000, we understand water quite well, methane quite well, ammonia quite well,

40:46.840 --> 40:47.840
 carbon dioxide.

40:47.840 --> 40:49.600
 I could keep going.

40:49.600 --> 40:55.940
 And then we understand molecules like acetylene, hydrogen cyanide, more or less.

40:55.940 --> 40:59.220
 And that takes us to about 4% of those 16,000.

40:59.220 --> 41:02.320
 We understand about 4% of them, more or less.

41:02.320 --> 41:04.280
 Phosphine is one of them.

41:04.280 --> 41:11.040
 But the other 96%, we just really have barely any idea at all of where in the spectrum of

41:11.040 --> 41:14.720
 light they would leave a mark.

41:14.720 --> 41:19.280
 I can't spend the next 62,000 years doing this work.

41:19.280 --> 41:26.420
 And I don't want to, even if somehow I was able, that wouldn't feel good.

41:26.420 --> 41:32.600
 So one of the things that I try to do now is move away from how I did phosphine.

41:32.600 --> 41:37.040
 So I did phosphine really the best that I could, the best that could be done with the

41:37.040 --> 41:42.280
 computer power that we have, trying to get each one of those 16.8 billion transitions

41:42.280 --> 41:46.640
 mapped accurately, calculated.

41:46.640 --> 41:50.000
 And then I thought, what if I do a worse job?

41:50.000 --> 41:53.160
 What if I just do a much worse job?

41:53.160 --> 41:57.680
 Can I just make it much faster and then it's still worth it?

41:57.680 --> 42:02.120
 How bad can I get before it's worthless?

42:02.120 --> 42:05.380
 And then could I do this for all the other molecules?

42:05.380 --> 42:10.560
 So I created exactly this terrible, terrible system.

42:10.560 --> 42:14.120
 So how, what's the answer to that question, that fundamental question I ask myself all

42:14.120 --> 42:15.600
 the time in other domains.

42:15.600 --> 42:17.400
 How crappy can I be before I'm useless?

42:17.400 --> 42:18.400
 Before somebody notices.

42:18.400 --> 42:26.520
 Turns out pretty crappy because no one has any idea what these molecules look like.

42:26.520 --> 42:28.640
 Anything is better than nothing.

42:28.640 --> 42:33.040
 And so I thought, how long will it take me to create better than nothing spectra for

42:33.040 --> 42:34.040
 all of these molecules?

42:34.040 --> 42:42.480
 And so I created RASCAL, Rapid Approximate Spectral Calculations for All.

42:42.480 --> 42:48.440
 And what I do is I use organic chemistry and quantum chemistry and kind of cheat them both.

42:48.440 --> 42:53.000
 I just try to figure out what is the fastest way I could run this.

42:53.000 --> 42:57.520
 And I simulate rough spectra for all of those 16,000.

42:57.520 --> 42:59.560
 So I've managed to get it to work.

42:59.560 --> 43:03.040
 It's really shocking how well it works considering how bad it is.

43:03.040 --> 43:08.600
 Is there insights you could give to like the tricks involved in making it fast?

43:08.600 --> 43:16.520
 Like what are the maybe some insightful shortcuts taken that still result in some useful information

43:16.520 --> 43:18.120
 about the spectra?

43:18.120 --> 43:22.280
 The insights came from organic chemistry from decades ago.

43:22.280 --> 43:26.840
 When organic chemists wanted to know what a compound might be, they will look at a spectrum

43:26.840 --> 43:31.120
 and see a feature and they would go, I've seen that feature before.

43:31.120 --> 43:36.040
 That's usually what happens when you have a carbon triple bonded to another carbon.

43:36.040 --> 43:37.440
 And they were mostly right.

43:37.440 --> 43:42.480
 Almost every molecule that has a carbon triple bonded to another one looks like that.

43:42.480 --> 43:47.360
 Has other features different that distinguish them from one another, but they have that

43:47.360 --> 43:49.320
 feature in common.

43:49.320 --> 43:51.280
 We call these functional groups.

43:51.280 --> 43:57.080
 And so most of that work ended up being abandoned because now we have mass spectrometry.

43:57.080 --> 44:03.160
 We got nuclear magnetic resin spectroscopy, so people don't really need to do that anymore.

44:03.160 --> 44:09.560
 But these ancient textbooks still exist and I've collected them all as many as I could.

44:09.560 --> 44:13.880
 And there are hundreds of these descriptions where people have said, oh, whenever you have

44:13.880 --> 44:20.620
 a iodine atom connected to this one, there's always a feature here and it's usually quite

44:20.620 --> 44:22.940
 sharp and it's quite strong.

44:22.940 --> 44:24.980
 And some people go, oh yeah, that's really broad feature.

44:24.980 --> 44:28.220
 Every time that combination of atoms and bonds.

44:28.220 --> 44:32.720
 So I've collected them all and I've created this giant dictionary of all these kind of

44:32.720 --> 44:37.440
 puzzle pieces, these Lego parts of molecules.

44:37.440 --> 44:41.640
 And I've written a code that then puts them all together in some kind of like Frankenstein's

44:41.640 --> 44:43.760
 monster of molecules.

44:43.760 --> 44:48.780
 So you asked me for any molecule and I go, well, it has these bonds and this atom dangling

44:48.780 --> 44:55.640
 off this atom and this cluster here, and I tell you what it should look like and it kind

44:55.640 --> 44:57.320
 of works.

44:57.320 --> 45:03.600
 So this creates a whole portfolio of just kind of signatures that we could look for.

45:03.600 --> 45:05.160
 Rough, very rough signatures.

45:05.160 --> 45:14.360
 But still useful enough to analyze the atmospheres, the telescope generated images of other planets?

45:14.360 --> 45:15.540
 Close.

45:15.540 --> 45:18.960
 Right now it is so complete.

45:18.960 --> 45:24.080
 So it has all of these molecules that it can tell you, say you look at an alien atmosphere

45:24.080 --> 45:26.320
 and there's a feature there.

45:26.320 --> 45:29.100
 It can tell you, oh, that feature, that's familiar.

45:29.100 --> 45:34.160
 It could be one of these 816 molecules, best of luck.

45:34.160 --> 45:38.520
 So I think the next step, which is what I'm working on is telling you something more useful

45:38.520 --> 45:41.320
 than it could be one of those 816 molecules.

45:41.320 --> 45:42.320
 That's still true.

45:42.320 --> 45:43.800
 I wouldn't say it's useful.

45:43.800 --> 45:48.680
 So it can tell you, but only 12% of them also have a feature in this region.

45:48.680 --> 45:49.680
 So go look there.

45:49.680 --> 45:53.400
 And if there's nothing there, it can't be those and so on.

45:53.400 --> 45:58.000
 It can also tell you things like you will need this much accuracy to distinguish between

45:58.000 --> 46:00.220
 those 816.

46:00.220 --> 46:03.080
 So that's what I'm working on.

46:03.080 --> 46:04.480
 But it's a lot of work.

46:04.480 --> 46:09.000
 So this is really interesting, the role of computing in this whole picture.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.200
 You mentioned code.

46:10.200 --> 46:18.600
 So like you as a quantum astrochemist, there is some role for programming in your life,

46:18.600 --> 46:21.440
 in your past life, in your current life, in your group?

46:21.440 --> 46:22.440
 Oh yeah, almost entirely.

46:22.440 --> 46:25.400
 I'm a computational quantum astrochemist, but that doesn't roll off the tongue very

46:25.400 --> 46:26.400
 easily.

46:26.400 --> 46:28.520
 So this is fundamentally computational.

46:28.520 --> 46:32.480
 Like if you want to be successful in the 21st century in doing quantum astrochemistry, you

46:32.480 --> 46:33.480
 want to be computational?

46:33.480 --> 46:34.480
 Absolutely.

46:34.480 --> 46:36.680
 All quantum chemistry is computational at this point.

46:36.680 --> 46:37.680
 Okay.

46:37.680 --> 46:40.560
 So does machine learning play a role at all?

46:40.560 --> 46:46.080
 Is there some extra shortcuts that could be discovered through, like you see all that

46:46.080 --> 46:48.280
 success with protein folding, right?

46:48.280 --> 46:58.800
 A problem that thought to be extremely difficult to apply machine learning to because it's,

46:58.800 --> 47:04.800
 I mean mostly because there's not a lot of already solved puzzles to train on.

47:04.800 --> 47:09.320
 I suppose the same exact thing is true with this particular problem, but is there hope

47:09.320 --> 47:11.480
 for machine learning to help out?

47:11.480 --> 47:12.600
 Absolutely.

47:12.600 --> 47:14.920
 Currently you've laid out exactly the problem.

47:14.920 --> 47:21.800
 The training set is awful and because there's so, a lot of this data that I'm basing it

47:21.800 --> 47:24.000
 on is literally many decades old.

47:24.000 --> 47:29.520
 The people who worked on it and data that I get, often they're dead and the files that

47:29.520 --> 47:34.240
 I've used, some of them were hand drawn by someone tired in the seventies.

47:34.240 --> 47:35.240
 Yes.

47:35.240 --> 47:40.560
 So I can of course have a program training on these, but I would just be perpetuating

47:40.560 --> 47:43.840
 these mistakes without hope of actually verifying them.

47:43.840 --> 47:51.360
 So my next step is to improve this training set by hand and then try to see if I can apply

47:51.360 --> 47:57.240
 machine learning on the full code of the full 16,000 molecules and improve them all.

47:57.240 --> 48:01.500
 But really I need to be able to test the outcomes with experimental data, which means convincing

48:01.500 --> 48:08.560
 someone in a lab to spend a lot of money putting very dangerous gases in chambers and measuring

48:08.560 --> 48:11.260
 them at outrageous temperatures.

48:11.260 --> 48:13.520
 So it's a work in progress.

48:13.520 --> 48:18.400
 And so collecting huge amounts of data about the actual gases.

48:18.400 --> 48:22.520
 So you are up for doing that kind of thing too.

48:22.520 --> 48:29.680
 So actually like doing the full end to end thing, which is like having a gas, collecting

48:29.680 --> 48:35.760
 data about it, and then doing the kind of analysis that creates the fingerprint and

48:35.760 --> 48:40.120
 then also analyzing using that library, the data that comes from other planets.

48:40.120 --> 48:41.760
 So you do the full.

48:41.760 --> 48:43.600
 Full from birth to death.

48:43.600 --> 48:44.600
 Interesting.

48:44.600 --> 48:45.600
 Yes.

48:45.600 --> 48:50.880
 I worked in an industrial chemistry laboratory when I was much younger in Slovenia and there

48:50.880 --> 48:56.640
 I worked in the lab actually collecting spectrum and predicting spectrum.

48:56.640 --> 49:00.800
 What's it like to work with a bunch of gases that are like not so human friendly?

49:00.800 --> 49:01.800
 It's terrifying.

49:01.800 --> 49:03.160
 It's horrific.

49:03.160 --> 49:04.320
 It's so scary.

49:04.320 --> 49:06.280
 And I love my job.

49:06.280 --> 49:15.160
 I'm willing to clearly sacrifice a lot for it, you know, job, stability, money, sanity.

49:15.160 --> 49:20.440
 But I only worked there for a few months and it was really terrifying.

49:20.440 --> 49:22.800
 There's just so many ways to die.

49:22.800 --> 49:26.200
 You know, usually you only have a handful of ways to die every day, you know.

49:26.200 --> 49:30.800
 And if you work in a lab, there's so many more, orders of magnitude more.

49:30.800 --> 49:32.920
 And I was very bad at it.

49:32.920 --> 49:35.840
 I'm not a good hands on scientist.

49:35.840 --> 49:43.240
 I want a laptop connected to a remote super computer or a laptop connected to a telescope.

49:43.240 --> 49:46.960
 I don't need to be there to believe it.

49:46.960 --> 49:48.760
 And I am not good in the lab.

49:48.760 --> 49:49.760
 Yeah.

49:49.760 --> 49:53.200
 When there's a bunch of things that can poison you, a bunch of things that could explode

49:53.200 --> 49:57.720
 and they're gaseous and they're often, maybe they might not even have a smell or they might

49:57.720 --> 49:59.820
 not be visible.

49:59.820 --> 50:00.820
 It's like...

50:00.820 --> 50:02.240
 So many of them give you cancer.

50:02.240 --> 50:03.840
 It's just so cruel.

50:03.840 --> 50:09.120
 And some people love this work, but I've never enjoyed experimental work.

50:09.120 --> 50:11.120
 It's so ungrateful.

50:11.120 --> 50:12.120
 So lonely.

50:12.120 --> 50:18.440
 Well, most, I mean, so much work is lonely if you find the joy in it, but you enjoy the

50:18.440 --> 50:19.920
 results of it.

50:19.920 --> 50:20.920
 Yes.

50:20.920 --> 50:26.160
 So I'm very thankful for all the experimentalists in my life, but I'll do the theory.

50:26.160 --> 50:30.200
 They do the experiment and then we talk to one another and make sure it matches.

50:30.200 --> 50:31.200
 Okay.

50:31.200 --> 50:32.200
 Beautiful.

50:32.200 --> 50:34.400
 What are spectroscopic networks?

50:34.400 --> 50:35.480
 Those look super cool.

50:35.480 --> 50:37.600
 Are they related to what we were talking about?

50:37.600 --> 50:38.600
 The picture look pretty.

50:38.600 --> 50:39.600
 Oh, yes, slightly.

50:39.600 --> 50:44.400
 So remember when I mentioned the 17.5 million energy levels?

50:44.400 --> 50:45.400
 Yes.

50:45.400 --> 50:51.640
 There are rules for each molecule on which energy levels they can jump from and to and

50:51.640 --> 50:53.900
 how likely it is to make that jump.

50:53.900 --> 51:01.040
 And so if you plot all the routes it can take, you get this energy network, which is like

51:01.040 --> 51:02.040
 a ball.

51:02.040 --> 51:06.200
 So these are the constraints of the transitions that could be taken.

51:06.200 --> 51:07.680
 Exactly for each molecule.

51:07.680 --> 51:08.680
 Interesting.

51:08.680 --> 51:13.840
 And they're not, so it's not a fully connected, it's like it's sparse somehow.

51:13.840 --> 51:15.800
 Yes, you get islands sometimes.

51:15.800 --> 51:20.920
 You get a molecule can only jump from one set of states to another and it's trapped

51:20.920 --> 51:21.920
 now in this network.

51:21.920 --> 51:27.680
 It can never go to another network that could have been available to other siblings.

51:27.680 --> 51:30.060
 Is there some insights to be drawn from these networks?

51:30.060 --> 51:33.800
 Like something cool that you can understand about a particular molecule because of it?

51:33.800 --> 51:34.800
 Yes.

51:34.800 --> 51:38.800
 Some molecules have what we call forbidden transitions, which aren't really forbidden

51:38.800 --> 51:39.800
 because it's quantum.

51:39.800 --> 51:40.800
 There are no rules.

51:40.800 --> 51:41.800
 No, I'm not joking.

51:41.800 --> 51:45.880
 One of the rules is just the rules are very often broken in the quantum world.

51:45.880 --> 51:49.240
 And so forbidden transitions doesn't actually mean they're forbidden.

51:49.240 --> 51:50.240
 Low probability.

51:50.240 --> 51:51.240
 Exactly.

51:51.240 --> 51:52.640
 They just become deeply unlikely.

51:52.640 --> 51:53.640
 Yeah.

51:53.640 --> 51:54.640
 Cool.

51:54.640 --> 51:58.620
 And so you could do all the same, like I'm coming from a computer science world, I love

51:58.620 --> 51:59.620
 graph theory.

51:59.620 --> 52:05.320
 So you can do all the same graph theoretic kind of analysis of clusters or something

52:05.320 --> 52:06.320
 like that.

52:06.320 --> 52:07.320
 Exactly.

52:07.320 --> 52:08.320
 All those kinds of things.

52:08.320 --> 52:09.320
 And draw insights from it.

52:09.320 --> 52:10.320
 Cool.

52:10.320 --> 52:11.320
 And they're unique for each molecule.

52:11.320 --> 52:17.040
 And the networks that you mentioned, that's actually not too difficult a layer of quantum

52:17.040 --> 52:18.040
 physics.

52:18.040 --> 52:19.960
 By then, all the energies are mapped.

52:19.960 --> 52:23.420
 So we've had high school children work on those networks.

52:23.420 --> 52:26.380
 And the trick is to not tell them they're doing quantum physics until like three months

52:26.380 --> 52:29.140
 in when it's too late for them to back out.

52:29.140 --> 52:31.080
 And then you're like, you're a quantum physicist now.

52:31.080 --> 52:32.080
 And it's really nice.

52:32.080 --> 52:33.080
 Yeah.

52:33.080 --> 52:34.080
 Okay.

52:34.080 --> 52:37.400
 But like the promise of this, even though it's 16,000, even just a subset of them, that's

52:37.400 --> 52:41.640
 really exciting because then you can do as the telescope data get better and better,

52:41.640 --> 52:46.120
 especially for exoplanets, but also for Venus.

52:46.120 --> 52:50.520
 You can then start like getting your full, like, you know how you get like blood work

52:50.520 --> 52:54.760
 done or like you get your genetic testing to see what your ancestors are.

52:54.760 --> 52:59.760
 You can get the same kind of like high resolution information about interesting things going

52:59.760 --> 53:02.240
 on on a particular planet based on the atmosphere.

53:02.240 --> 53:03.240
 Right?

53:03.240 --> 53:04.240
 Exactly.

53:04.240 --> 53:07.360
 How cool would that be if we could, you know, scan an alien planet and go,

53:07.360 --> 53:09.080
 oh, this is what the clouds are made of.

53:09.080 --> 53:10.680
 This is what's in the surface.

53:10.680 --> 53:12.640
 These are the molecules that are mixing.

53:12.640 --> 53:16.880
 Here are probably oceans because you can see these types of molecules above it.

53:16.880 --> 53:19.360
 And here are the Hadley cells.

53:19.360 --> 53:22.300
 Here are how the biosphere works.

53:22.300 --> 53:24.160
 We could map this whole thing.

53:24.160 --> 53:28.320
 Wouldn't it be cool if the aliens like are aware of these techniques and like would spoof

53:28.320 --> 53:33.680
 like the wrong gases, just to like pretend that's how they can be, it's like an invisibility

53:33.680 --> 53:34.680
 cloak.

53:34.680 --> 53:39.440
 They can generate gases that would throw you off or like, or do the opposite.

53:39.440 --> 53:42.200
 They pretend they will artificially generate phosphine.

53:42.200 --> 53:47.840
 So like, like the dumb, the dumb apes on earth again, like go out, like flying in different

53:47.840 --> 53:49.660
 places because it's just fun.

53:49.660 --> 53:53.440
 It's like some teenager alien somewhere, just pranking.

53:53.440 --> 53:54.440
 Yeah.

53:54.440 --> 54:04.240
 I was asked that exact question this Saturday by, by a 70 year old boy in Canada, but it

54:04.240 --> 54:10.400
 was the first time I'd been asked that question, the second in a week.

54:10.400 --> 54:12.540
 We're kindred spirits, him and I.

54:12.540 --> 54:19.520
 We can, they can prank us to some extent, but the, this work of interpreting an alien

54:19.520 --> 54:25.760
 atmosphere means you're reading the atmosphere as a message and it's very hard to hide signs

54:25.760 --> 54:32.160
 of life in an atmosphere because you can try to prank us, but you're still going to fart

54:32.160 --> 54:37.960
 and breathe and somehow metabolize the environment around you and call that whatever you call

54:37.960 --> 54:41.160
 that and release molecules.

54:41.160 --> 54:42.520
 And so that's really hard to hide.

54:42.520 --> 54:44.820
 You know, you can go very quiet.

54:44.820 --> 54:50.400
 You can throw out some weird molecule to confuse us further, but we can still see all your

54:50.400 --> 54:51.400
 other metabolites.

54:51.400 --> 54:52.400
 Yeah.

54:52.400 --> 54:53.400
 It's hard to fake.

54:53.400 --> 55:00.800
 Is there, so you kind of mentioned like water that what, what other gases are there that

55:00.800 --> 55:06.800
 we know about that are like high likelihood as biosignatures in terms of life?

55:06.800 --> 55:14.400
 I mean, what are your other favorites in terms of, so, so we've got phosphine, but like what,

55:14.400 --> 55:19.080
 what else is a damn good signal to be a, that you think about that we should be looking

55:19.080 --> 55:23.760
 for if we look at another atmosphere, is there gases that come to mind or are there all sort

55:23.760 --> 55:29.080
 of possible biosignatures that we should love equally?

55:29.080 --> 55:31.600
 There's many, so there's water.

55:31.600 --> 55:33.480
 We know that's important for life as we know it.

55:33.480 --> 55:35.400
 There's molecular oxygen on earth.

55:35.400 --> 55:39.720
 That's probably the most robust sign of life, particularly combined with small amounts of

55:39.720 --> 55:40.720
 methane.

55:40.720 --> 55:44.700
 And it's true that the majority of the oxygen in our atmosphere is a product of life.

55:44.700 --> 55:50.680
 And so if I was an alien astronomer and I saw earth's atmosphere, I'm, I would get a

55:50.680 --> 55:52.640
 Nobel I think on, you know,

55:52.640 --> 55:53.640
 What would you notice?

55:53.640 --> 55:54.640
 I mean, this is a really,

55:54.640 --> 55:57.560
 I would be very excited about this.

55:57.560 --> 55:58.560
 About the oxygen.

55:58.560 --> 56:02.280
 I'm not finding 20%, 21% of oxygen atmosphere.

56:02.280 --> 56:03.280
 That's very unusual.

56:03.280 --> 56:07.160
 So would that be the most exciting thing to you from an alien perspective about earth

56:07.160 --> 56:12.400
 in terms of the tech, like analyzing the atmosphere, like what are the biosignatures of life on

56:12.400 --> 56:13.400
 earth?

56:13.400 --> 56:18.160
 Would you say in terms of the contents of the atmosphere is oxygen, high amount of oxygen,

56:18.160 --> 56:19.600
 pretty damn good sign.

56:19.600 --> 56:23.440
 I mean, it's not as good as the TV signals we've been sending out.

56:23.440 --> 56:27.760
 Those are slightly more robust than oxygen.

56:27.760 --> 56:30.140
 Oxygen on its own has false positives for life.

56:30.140 --> 56:36.520
 So there's still ways of making it, but it's, it's a pretty robust sign of life in the context

56:36.520 --> 56:41.480
 or atmosphere with the radiation that the sun produces, our position in relation to

56:41.480 --> 56:47.040
 the sun, the other components of our atmosphere, the volcanic activity we have, all of that

56:47.040 --> 56:53.920
 together makes the 20% of oxygen extremely robust sign of life.

56:53.920 --> 56:59.520
 But outside that context, you could still produce oxygen without life.

56:59.520 --> 57:03.520
 But phosphine, although better in the sense of it is much harder to make, it has lower

57:03.520 --> 57:06.260
 false positives, still has some.

57:06.260 --> 57:12.080
 So I'm actually against looking for specific molecules unless we're looking for like CFCs.

57:12.080 --> 57:16.900
 If we find CFCs, that's definitely aliens, I feel confident, chlorofluorocarbons.

57:16.900 --> 57:22.520
 And so, you know, if aliens had been watching us, they would have been going, oh no, CFCs.

57:22.520 --> 57:25.200
 I mean, they're not going to last long.

57:25.200 --> 57:30.560
 Let's, you know, everyone's writing their thesis on the end of, the end of the earth.

57:30.560 --> 57:33.280
 And then we got together, we stopped using them.

57:33.280 --> 57:35.440
 I like to think they're really proud of us.

57:35.440 --> 57:38.280
 You know, they literally saw our ozone hole shrinking.

57:38.280 --> 57:40.200
 They've been watching it and they saw it happen.

57:40.200 --> 57:43.440
 I think to be honest, they're more paying attention to the whole nuclear thing.

57:43.440 --> 57:44.440
 I don't think they care.

57:44.440 --> 57:45.440
 It's not going to bother them.

57:45.440 --> 57:46.440
 Oh, I mean, worried about us.

57:46.440 --> 57:47.440
 Oh yes.

57:47.440 --> 57:48.440
 Oh no, worried about us.

57:48.440 --> 57:53.040
 They, I mean, this is why the aliens have been showing up recently.

57:53.040 --> 57:56.960
 It's like, if you, if you look at, I mean, there is, I mean, it's probably, there's a

57:56.960 --> 58:02.080
 correlation with a lot of things, but what the ufologists quote unquote often talk about

58:02.080 --> 58:08.400
 is that there seems to be a much higher level of UFO sightings since like in the nuclear

58:08.400 --> 58:09.720
 age.

58:09.720 --> 58:14.000
 So like if aliens were indeed worried about us, like if you were aliens, you would start

58:14.000 --> 58:21.000
 showing up when the living organisms first discovered a way to destroy the entire, the

58:21.000 --> 58:22.680
 entire colony.

58:22.680 --> 58:28.720
 Can the increase in sightings not have to do with the fact that people now have more

58:28.720 --> 58:29.720
 cameras?

58:29.720 --> 58:37.600
 It's an interesting thing about science, like with UFO sightings, it's like either 99.9%

58:37.600 --> 58:40.240
 of them are false or 100% of them are false.

58:40.240 --> 58:46.320
 The interesting thing to me is that in that 0.01%, there's a lot of things in science

58:46.320 --> 58:52.080
 that are like these weird outliers that are difficult to replicate.

58:52.080 --> 58:55.120
 You have like, there's even physical phenomena, ball lightning.

58:55.120 --> 59:00.960
 There's difficult things to artificially create in large amounts or observe in nature in large

59:00.960 --> 59:05.640
 amounts in such a way that you can do it to apply the scientific method that could be

59:05.640 --> 59:11.600
 just things that like what happened like a few times or once and you're like, what the

59:11.600 --> 59:13.420
 hell is that?

59:13.420 --> 59:16.280
 And that's very difficult for science to know what to do with.

59:16.280 --> 59:20.920
 I'm a huge proponent of just being open minded because when you're open minded about aliens,

59:20.920 --> 59:27.600
 for example, it allows you to think outside of the box in other domains as well.

59:27.600 --> 59:33.280
 And somehow that will result, like if you're open minded about aliens and you don't laugh

59:33.280 --> 59:37.560
 it off immediately, what happens is somehow that's going to lead to a solution to a P

59:37.560 --> 59:39.760
 equals NP or P not equals NP.

59:39.760 --> 59:45.880
 Like in ways that you can't predict, the open mindedness has tertiary effects that will

59:45.880 --> 59:51.840
 result in progress, I believe, which is why I'm a huge fan of aliens because it's like

59:51.840 --> 59:57.360
 because too many scientists roll their eyes at the idea of aliens, alien life.

59:57.360 --> 1:00:06.280
 And to me, it's one of the most exciting possibilities in the biggest, most exciting questions before

1:00:06.280 --> 1:00:07.720
 all of human civilization.

1:00:07.720 --> 1:00:12.520
 So to roll your eyes is not the right answer.

1:00:12.520 --> 1:00:16.800
 To roll your eyes presumes that you know anything about this world as opposed to just knowing

1:00:16.800 --> 1:00:19.560
 point zero zero zero one percent of this world.

1:00:19.560 --> 1:00:26.760
 And so being humble in the face of that, being open to the possibility of aliens visiting

1:00:26.760 --> 1:00:29.120
 Earth is a good idea.

1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:30.160
 Not everything, though.

1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:36.960
 I'm not so open minded to the flat Earth hypothesis as there's a growing number of people believing

1:00:36.960 --> 1:00:37.960
 in.

1:00:37.960 --> 1:00:38.960
 But even then.

1:00:38.960 --> 1:00:42.200
 Or the inner Earth, I've got shouted at in a public talk about it.

1:00:42.200 --> 1:00:43.760
 So like the Earth is hollow?

1:00:43.760 --> 1:00:44.760
 Yeah.

1:00:44.760 --> 1:00:51.500
 My understanding is that there's this conspiracy theory that as far as I can tell has no grounding

1:00:51.500 --> 1:00:56.200
 in reality is that there's a slightly smaller Earth inside this one, which is just too cute

1:00:56.200 --> 1:00:57.200
 as a concept.

1:00:57.200 --> 1:00:58.200
 That's awesome.

1:00:58.200 --> 1:01:00.800
 And you can access it, I think, from Antarctica.

1:01:00.800 --> 1:01:05.240
 And that's where we keep, and I quote, the mammoths and the Nazis.

1:01:05.240 --> 1:01:08.700
 Yeah, I mean, that one is ridiculous.

1:01:08.700 --> 1:01:09.700
 But like I do like.

1:01:09.700 --> 1:01:12.800
 Hey, I thought you were keeping an open mind.

1:01:12.800 --> 1:01:15.880
 I genuinely think that's more likely than aliens visiting the Earth.

1:01:15.880 --> 1:01:21.920
 And I say this as someone who has dedicated her life to finding like alien life.

1:01:21.920 --> 1:01:27.680
 And so that's how improbable, I think, the visitations are.

1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:32.720
 Because interstellar distances are so huge that it's just not really worth it.

1:01:32.720 --> 1:01:34.560
 See, I have a different view on this whole thing.

1:01:34.560 --> 1:01:43.080
 I think the aliens that look like little green men are like extremely low probability event.

1:01:43.080 --> 1:01:48.920
 Like mammoths and Nazis under that level.

1:01:48.920 --> 1:01:57.760
 But other kind of ideas, like the sad thing to me, and I think in my view, if there's

1:01:57.760 --> 1:02:04.120
 other alien civilizations out there and they visited Earth, neither them or perhaps just

1:02:04.120 --> 1:02:06.920
 us would be even able to detect them.

1:02:06.920 --> 1:02:10.400
 Like we wouldn't be open minded enough to see it.

1:02:10.400 --> 1:02:19.880
 Like if, because our understanding of what is life, and I just talked to Sarah Walker,

1:02:19.880 --> 1:02:20.880
 who's.

1:02:20.880 --> 1:02:21.880
 You know Sarah.

1:02:21.880 --> 1:02:25.400
 Yeah, we talked for three hours about the question of what is life.

1:02:25.400 --> 1:02:29.320
 Sarah's a good person to talk to about what is life.

1:02:29.320 --> 1:02:33.520
 But like the whole point is we don't really, we have a very narrow minded view of what

1:02:33.520 --> 1:02:34.520
 is life.

1:02:34.520 --> 1:02:45.080
 And when it shows up, and it might be already here, trees and dolphins and so on, or mountains

1:02:45.080 --> 1:02:53.400
 or I don't know, or the molecules in the atmosphere, or like people make fun of me.

1:02:53.400 --> 1:02:57.640
 But I do think that ideas are kind of aliens themselves, or consciousness could be the

1:02:57.640 --> 1:03:00.620
 aliens, or it could be the method by which they communicate.

1:03:00.620 --> 1:03:03.640
 We don't know shit about the way our human mind works.

1:03:03.640 --> 1:03:09.600
 And the fact that this thing is a quantum process, please don't I understand this.

1:03:09.600 --> 1:03:10.600
 It's not woo woo.

1:03:10.600 --> 1:03:14.520
 I'm not I, we could, but it very well could be there could be something at the at the

1:03:14.520 --> 1:03:16.140
 physics level, right?

1:03:16.140 --> 1:03:19.360
 It could be at the chemical or the biological level, things that are happening that we're

1:03:19.360 --> 1:03:27.120
 just close to close minded, because our conception of life is at the level of like us, like at

1:03:27.120 --> 1:03:30.080
 the jungle level of mammals.

1:03:30.080 --> 1:03:34.680
 And on the time scale, that's the human time scale, we may not be able to perceive what

1:03:34.680 --> 1:03:42.640
 alien life is actually like what the scale at which their intelligence realizes itself

1:03:42.640 --> 1:03:45.040
 when we're not able to perceive.

1:03:45.040 --> 1:03:49.960
 And the other thing that's really important about alien visitations, whether it happened

1:03:49.960 --> 1:03:56.560
 or not, is especially after COVID in 2020, I'm losing a little bit of faith of our government

1:03:56.560 --> 1:04:04.120
 being able to handle that that well, not our government, but us as a society, as a collective,

1:04:04.120 --> 1:04:11.880
 being able to deal with new things in an effective way that's inspiring, that's efficient, that

1:04:11.880 --> 1:04:19.680
 like, whether it's if it's a dangerous thing to deal with it to alleviate the danger, whether

1:04:19.680 --> 1:04:24.880
 it's the possibility of new discoveries and something inspiring to ride that wave and

1:04:24.880 --> 1:04:27.000
 make it inspiring all those kinds of things.

1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:31.120
 I honestly think if aliens showed up, they would look around, everybody would ignore

1:04:31.120 --> 1:04:36.480
 them and the government might like hide it, try to like see to keep it from the Chinese

1:04:36.480 --> 1:04:41.400
 and the Russians if it's the United States, call it a military secret in a very close

1:04:41.400 --> 1:04:42.880
 minded way.

1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:48.000
 And then the bureaucracy would drown it away to where through paperwork, the poor aliens

1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:51.280
 would just like waste away and sell somewhere like there's a certain

1:04:51.280 --> 1:04:55.400
 That would not happen, that would never happen, part of the reason that I feel so confident

1:04:55.400 --> 1:04:59.480
 that aliens have not visited because they would have had to visit just to have a look

1:04:59.480 --> 1:05:04.800
 remotely, from Neptune or something, which makes no sense because interstellar travel

1:05:04.800 --> 1:05:12.040
 is so difficult that it would be quite a ridiculous proposition, but that's the bit that I think

1:05:12.040 --> 1:05:13.540
 is technically possible.

1:05:13.540 --> 1:05:18.880
 If they did come here and they were visible by anyone, detectable by anyone, the thought

1:05:18.880 --> 1:05:24.360
 that any government, no matter, or any military could just contain them, these beings are

1:05:24.360 --> 1:05:30.560
 capable of traveling interstellar distances when we can barely go to the moon, like barely

1:05:30.560 --> 1:05:31.560
 go to the moon.

1:05:31.560 --> 1:05:32.560
 These things would be way, way, way, way out there.

1:05:32.560 --> 1:05:33.560
 Way.

1:05:33.560 --> 1:05:38.360
 And the fact that we think our puny military, even if all the military in the world got

1:05:38.360 --> 1:05:44.240
 together and the fact that they could somehow contain it, that's the bit that's laughable.

1:05:44.240 --> 1:05:47.000
 Ants trying to contain a human that visited them.

1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:48.000
 Exactly.

1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:50.560
 And scientists, you would have to bring scientists on board.

1:05:50.560 --> 1:05:52.280
 You've met a lot of scientists.

1:05:52.280 --> 1:05:53.680
 How good are they at keeping secrets?

1:05:53.680 --> 1:05:58.760
 Because in my experience, they're absolutely appalling at keeping secrets.

1:05:58.760 --> 1:05:59.760
 Yeah, that's terrible.

1:05:59.760 --> 1:06:03.320
 Even the Phosphine on Venus thing, which was a pretty well kept secret.

1:06:03.320 --> 1:06:04.320
 This is true.

1:06:04.320 --> 1:06:05.320
 You had a bunch of people that were.

1:06:05.320 --> 1:06:06.320
 I told my dad.

1:06:06.320 --> 1:06:07.320
 Yeah.

1:06:07.320 --> 1:06:12.680
 You know, my dad knew and hopefully didn't tell anyone, but if it had been an alien visiting,

1:06:12.680 --> 1:06:15.440
 he probably would have told a mate, you know?

1:06:15.440 --> 1:06:20.960
 And so these secrets could not be kept by any scientist that I know and certainly not

1:06:20.960 --> 1:06:23.000
 collaborative scientists, which would be needed.

1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:26.080
 You would need all sorts of scientific teams.

1:06:26.080 --> 1:06:34.360
 So between the pathetic power of any world's military compared to any civilization capable

1:06:34.360 --> 1:06:41.600
 of traveling and our absolute inability to keep secrets, absolutely not.

1:06:41.600 --> 1:06:46.320
 I will bet everything that we have not been visited because we are too pathetic to hold

1:06:46.320 --> 1:06:47.320
 that truth.

1:06:47.320 --> 1:06:56.160
 If we're just making like a $10 bet, the possibility here that the main alien, say there exists

1:06:56.160 --> 1:07:02.560
 one alien civil, other intelligent alien civilization in the galaxy.

1:07:02.560 --> 1:07:09.840
 To me, if they visit Earth, what's going to visit Earth is like the crappy, like the really

1:07:09.840 --> 1:07:17.640
 crappy, short straw, like, like this, this like really dumb thing that's, I don't know,

1:07:17.640 --> 1:07:20.680
 like the early game boys or something like, there's a cartoon about this.

1:07:20.680 --> 1:07:26.520
 There's an alien that gets sent to Earth, Commander Spiff or something, and it's kind

1:07:26.520 --> 1:07:29.600
 of a punishment or something, but that's not possible.

1:07:29.600 --> 1:07:34.040
 That's the thing because interstellar distances are so hard to, to cross.

1:07:34.040 --> 1:07:35.040
 You have to do it on purpose.

1:07:35.040 --> 1:07:36.040
 You have to do on purpose.

1:07:36.040 --> 1:07:40.040
 It has to be a big, big deal, and we know this because yes, you're right.

1:07:40.040 --> 1:07:43.640
 We don't know enough about galactic biology.

1:07:43.640 --> 1:07:47.960
 We don't know what the universal rules of biology or biochemistry are because we only

1:07:47.960 --> 1:07:53.560
 have the Earth, but we do know that the laws of physics are universal.

1:07:53.560 --> 1:07:57.940
 We can predict behavior in the universe and then see it happen based on these laws of

1:07:57.940 --> 1:07:59.100
 physics.

1:07:59.100 --> 1:08:01.900
 We know that the laws of chemistry are universal.

1:08:01.900 --> 1:08:05.240
 We know the periodic table is all they have to choose from.

1:08:05.240 --> 1:08:11.000
 So yes, they may be some sort of unimaginable intelligence, but they still have to use the

1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:13.960
 same periodic table that we have access to.

1:08:13.960 --> 1:08:18.120
 They still have a finite number of molecules they can do things with.

1:08:18.120 --> 1:08:22.700
 So they still have to use the resources around them, the stars around them, the universe

1:08:22.700 --> 1:08:26.640
 around them, and we know how much energy is in these places.

1:08:26.640 --> 1:08:32.480
 And so yes, they may be very capable, capable beyond our wildest dreams, but they're still

1:08:32.480 --> 1:08:35.400
 in the same universe, and we know a lot of those rules.

1:08:35.400 --> 1:08:37.120
 We're not completely blind.

1:08:37.120 --> 1:08:43.240
 But there's a colleague of yours at Harvard, Kamran Vafa, he's a theoretical physicist.

1:08:43.240 --> 1:08:45.240
 I don't know if you know him.

1:08:45.240 --> 1:08:48.240
 I've only joined Harvard about six months ago.

1:08:48.240 --> 1:08:49.240
 Okay.

1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:52.860
 It's time to meet all the theoretical physicists.

1:08:52.860 --> 1:09:01.280
 So he's a string theorist, but his idea is that aliens that are sophisticated enough

1:09:01.280 --> 1:09:05.840
 to travel interstellar like those kinds of distances will figure out actually ways to

1:09:05.840 --> 1:09:11.160
 hack the fabric of the universe enough to have fun in other ways, like this universe

1:09:11.160 --> 1:09:12.160
 is too boring.

1:09:12.160 --> 1:09:17.740
 Like you would figure out ways to create other universes, like you go outside the physics

1:09:17.740 --> 1:09:19.380
 as we know it.

1:09:19.380 --> 1:09:23.440
 So the reason we don't see aliens visiting us all over the place is they're having fun

1:09:23.440 --> 1:09:24.440
 elsewhere.

1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:26.060
 This is like way too boring.

1:09:26.060 --> 1:09:32.080
 We humans think this is fun, but it's actually mostly empty space that no fun is happening.

1:09:32.080 --> 1:09:35.800
 There's no fun in visiting Earth for a super advanced civilization.

1:09:35.800 --> 1:09:42.040
 So he thinks like if alien civilizations are out there, they found outside of our current

1:09:42.040 --> 1:09:47.680
 standard models of physics ways of having fun that don't involve us.

1:09:47.680 --> 1:09:52.540
 That's probably true, but even the notion of visiting, that's so literally pedestrian.

1:09:52.540 --> 1:09:55.800
 Of course we want to go there because going there is the only thing we know.

1:09:55.800 --> 1:09:58.480
 We see a thing we want, we want to go there and get it.

1:09:58.480 --> 1:10:03.600
 But that is probably something they've no longer gotten need for.

1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:08.080
 I specifically don't particularly want to go to space.

1:10:08.080 --> 1:10:09.080
 Sounds awful.

1:10:09.080 --> 1:10:13.960
 None of the things I like are going to be there.

1:10:13.960 --> 1:10:17.880
 My whole work is my whole career is finding life and understanding the universe.

1:10:17.880 --> 1:10:23.840
 So I care a lot, but I care about knowing about it and I feel no need to go there to

1:10:23.840 --> 1:10:25.040
 learn about it.

1:10:25.040 --> 1:10:30.360
 And I think as we develop better tools, hopefully people will feel less and less a need to go

1:10:30.360 --> 1:10:33.120
 everywhere that we know about.

1:10:33.120 --> 1:10:38.460
 And I would expect any alien civilization worth the salt have developed observation

1:10:38.460 --> 1:10:44.600
 tools and tools that allow them to understand the universe around them and beyond without

1:10:44.600 --> 1:10:46.160
 having to go there.

1:10:46.160 --> 1:10:48.120
 This going is so wasteful.

1:10:48.120 --> 1:10:49.120
 Yeah.

1:10:49.120 --> 1:10:53.320
 So more focused on the knowledge and learning versus the colonization, like the conquering

1:10:53.320 --> 1:10:55.280
 and all those kinds of things.

1:10:55.280 --> 1:10:57.480
 That's beneath them.

1:10:57.480 --> 1:10:58.480
 That's beneath them.

1:10:58.480 --> 1:11:04.160
 I mean, that said, do you think there's in your hopeful search for life through phosphine

1:11:04.160 --> 1:11:11.080
 and other gases, do you think there's other alien civilizations out there?

1:11:11.080 --> 1:11:14.040
 First do you think there's other life out there?

1:11:14.040 --> 1:11:17.040
 First do you think there's life in the solar system?

1:11:17.040 --> 1:11:22.080
 Second do you think there's life in the galaxy?

1:11:22.080 --> 1:11:26.560
 And a third, do you think there's intelligent life in the solar system or the galaxy outside

1:11:26.560 --> 1:11:28.000
 of earth?

1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:30.280
 So intelligent life, I have no idea.

1:11:30.280 --> 1:11:35.440
 It seems deeply unlikely possible, but I'm not even sure if it's plausible.

1:11:35.440 --> 1:11:38.880
 So that's the special thing to you about earth is somehow intelligent life came to me.

1:11:38.880 --> 1:11:39.880
 Yes.

1:11:39.880 --> 1:11:43.800
 And it's only, you know, very briefly, probably extremely briefly.

1:11:43.800 --> 1:11:48.640
 Oh, you mean like it's always going to be like, we're going to destroy ourselves.

1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:49.640
 Exactly.

1:11:49.640 --> 1:11:50.640
 Oh boy.

1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:54.400
 We're going to continue on earth happily, probably more happily.

1:11:54.400 --> 1:11:56.960
 So the trees and the dolphins will be here, I'm telling you.

1:11:56.960 --> 1:12:02.320
 And the cockroaches and the incredible fungi, you know, they'll be fine.

1:12:02.320 --> 1:12:08.120
 So life on earth will be fine, was fine before us and will be fine after us.

1:12:08.120 --> 1:12:12.160
 So I'm not that worried about intelligent life, but I think it is unlikely, even on

1:12:12.160 --> 1:12:16.400
 earth is unlikely out of, what is it, five billion species across the history of the

1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:17.400
 earth.

1:12:17.400 --> 1:12:18.400
 Yes.

1:12:18.400 --> 1:12:24.500
 For an intelligent one and for a blink of an eye, possibly not much longer than that.

1:12:24.500 --> 1:12:31.640
 So I wouldn't bet on that at all, though I would love it, of course, you know, I wanted

1:12:31.640 --> 1:12:34.680
 to find aliens since I was a little girl.

1:12:34.680 --> 1:12:40.900
 And so of course I initially wanted to find ones that I could be friends with and I've

1:12:40.900 --> 1:12:44.280
 had to let go of that dream because it's so deeply implausible.

1:12:44.280 --> 1:12:47.680
 But see the nice, and sorry to interrupt, but the nice thing about intelligent alien

1:12:47.680 --> 1:12:52.480
 civilizations, they may have more biosignatures than nonintelligent ones.

1:12:52.480 --> 1:12:56.320
 So they might be easier to detect, that would be the hope.

1:12:56.320 --> 1:12:58.680
 On earth that's not the case, but it could be the case elsewhere.

1:12:58.680 --> 1:13:00.480
 Oh, it's not the case on earth.

1:13:00.480 --> 1:13:06.000
 Most of the biosignatures we have on earth are created by quite simple life.

1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:11.200
 If you don't count pollution, pollution is all, all us baby.

1:13:11.200 --> 1:13:17.080
 So you don't see polluting gases as a possible, like.

1:13:17.080 --> 1:13:18.560
 I look for polluting gases.

1:13:18.560 --> 1:13:20.640
 I would love to find polluting gases.

1:13:20.640 --> 1:13:26.520
 Well, you know, I'd be worried for them, of course, the same way I, I think about my alien

1:13:26.520 --> 1:13:30.720
 colleagues all the time looking at us and I'm sure they worry about our pollutions,

1:13:30.720 --> 1:13:38.120
 but it would be a really good, robust, unambiguous sign of life if we found complex pollutants.

1:13:38.120 --> 1:13:39.440
 So I look for those too.

1:13:39.440 --> 1:13:41.080
 I just don't have any hope of finding them.

1:13:41.080 --> 1:13:47.800
 I think intelligent life in the galaxy at the same time that we're looking is deeply

1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:56.160
 implausible, but life I think is inevitable and if it is inevitable, it is common.

1:13:56.160 --> 1:14:00.080
 So I think there'll be life everywhere in the galaxy.

1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:04.680
 Now how common that life is, I think will depend a lot on whether there's life in the

1:14:04.680 --> 1:14:07.080
 solar system beyond earth.

1:14:07.080 --> 1:14:13.220
 So I'll adjust my expectations very much based on there being life in the solar system.

1:14:13.220 --> 1:14:19.380
 If there's life in the Venusian clouds, if there's life in the, if there are biosignals

1:14:19.380 --> 1:14:23.200
 coming out of the plumes of Enceladus, if there's life on Titan.

1:14:23.200 --> 1:14:24.200
 Yeah, that's right.

1:14:24.200 --> 1:14:25.200
 Yeah, yeah.

1:14:25.200 --> 1:14:26.200
 Plumes of Enceladus.

1:14:26.200 --> 1:14:27.880
 That's the, that's the Saturn one.

1:14:27.880 --> 1:14:30.320
 It's the moon that has the geysers that come out.

1:14:30.320 --> 1:14:34.160
 And so you can't see the, under the subterranean oceans, but.

1:14:34.160 --> 1:14:36.520
 It's supposed, so it would be in the atmosphere.

1:14:36.520 --> 1:14:39.000
 I was going to ask you about that one.

1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:40.000
 Have you looked at that?

1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:49.360
 Have you, is that a hope for you to use the tools you're using with RASCAL and other ways

1:14:49.360 --> 1:14:56.400
 for detecting the 16,000 molecules that might be biosignatures to look at Enceladus?

1:14:56.400 --> 1:14:59.920
 Yes, that's absolutely the plan.

1:14:59.920 --> 1:15:01.560
 What's the limiting factor currently?

1:15:01.560 --> 1:15:06.760
 Is it the quality of the telescopes, what's the quality of the data?

1:15:06.760 --> 1:15:12.560
 Yeah, the quality of the data, the observational data, and also the quality of RASCAL and other

1:15:12.560 --> 1:15:13.560
 associated things.

1:15:13.560 --> 1:15:17.680
 So we're missing a lot of fundamental data to interpret the data that we get and we don't

1:15:17.680 --> 1:15:19.240
 have good enough data.

1:15:19.240 --> 1:15:24.760
 But hopefully we will, in the coming decades, we'll get some information on Titan.

1:15:24.760 --> 1:15:27.880
 We have Dragonfly going over.

1:15:27.880 --> 1:15:31.400
 We'll get the plumes of Enceladus.

1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:34.040
 We will look at the clouds of Venus and there's other places.

1:15:34.040 --> 1:15:41.740
 And so if we find any life or any sign of life ever, like on Mars, then I'll adjust

1:15:41.740 --> 1:15:48.520
 my calculations and I'll say life is not just inevitable and common, but extremely common.

1:15:48.520 --> 1:15:52.720
 Because all of these places we've mentioned, the subterranean oceans on Enceladus, the

1:15:52.720 --> 1:15:58.240
 methane oceans of Titan, the clouds of Venus, the acidic clouds of Venus, these are places

1:15:58.240 --> 1:16:02.280
 that are very different from the places where we find life on Earth.

1:16:02.280 --> 1:16:04.200
 Even the most extreme places.

1:16:04.200 --> 1:16:10.120
 And so if life can originate in all of these completely different habitats, then life is

1:16:10.120 --> 1:16:14.860
 even more resourceful than we thought, which means it's everywhere.

1:16:14.860 --> 1:16:17.200
 That's really exciting if it's everywhere.

1:16:17.200 --> 1:16:21.320
 If there's life on just one of the moons, if it's on Mars.

1:16:21.320 --> 1:16:22.320
 Anywhere.

1:16:22.320 --> 1:16:27.080
 Anywhere in the solar system and I will bet everything I own that every solar system,

1:16:27.080 --> 1:16:31.360
 every planetary system has a potential for habitability.

1:16:31.360 --> 1:16:35.440
 Because even if they don't have a habitable planet, they'll have moons around other giant

1:16:35.440 --> 1:16:39.280
 planets and there'll be so much life.

1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:44.960
 So for me, that's the only thing to figure out now, whether life is inevitable and quite

1:16:44.960 --> 1:16:51.860
 common throughout the galaxy or everywhere, but it's somewhere between those two.

1:16:51.860 --> 1:16:58.480
 In life, I make no bets and if I had to bet, I would be against.

1:16:58.480 --> 1:17:05.280
 To me, like two discoveries in the 21st century would change everything.

1:17:05.280 --> 1:17:12.800
 One is, and maybe I'm biased, but one is a discovery of life in the solar system.

1:17:12.800 --> 1:17:18.600
 I feel like that would change our whole conception of how unique we are in the universe.

1:17:18.600 --> 1:17:23.560
 I think I'm much more eager than you are to jump from basic life to intelligent life.

1:17:23.560 --> 1:17:31.880
 I feel like if there's life everywhere, like the odds are, there has, like we cannot, like

1:17:31.880 --> 1:17:34.320
 you have, oh, I see.

1:17:34.320 --> 1:17:37.880
 You're saying there could have been many intelligent civilizations out there, but they just keep

1:17:37.880 --> 1:17:38.880
 dying out.

1:17:38.880 --> 1:17:39.880
 It's like little.

1:17:39.880 --> 1:17:40.880
 Yeah.

1:17:40.880 --> 1:17:41.880
 I was detecting them, you know, ships in the night.

1:17:41.880 --> 1:17:42.880
 Ships in the night.

1:17:42.880 --> 1:17:45.640
 No, that's ultra sad.

1:17:45.640 --> 1:17:46.640
 Just like.

1:17:46.640 --> 1:17:47.640
 Is it sad?

1:17:47.640 --> 1:17:50.400
 The earth is not better for having us.

1:17:50.400 --> 1:17:53.640
 Is it, we, it doesn't owe us anything.

1:17:53.640 --> 1:17:56.120
 Would you be sad to find alien giraffes?

1:17:56.120 --> 1:17:59.240
 Would you be disappointed if you found alien giraffes?

1:17:59.240 --> 1:18:00.240
 Because I would not.

1:18:00.240 --> 1:18:04.280
 No, well, giraffes, first of all, they look goofy with their necks and everything, but.

1:18:04.280 --> 1:18:05.720
 We do not shit on giraffes.

1:18:05.720 --> 1:18:06.720
 Okay.

1:18:06.720 --> 1:18:09.240
 Giraffes are wondrous animals, are deeply understudied.

1:18:09.240 --> 1:18:12.840
 We still know so little about them because no one does PhDs in giraffes.

1:18:12.840 --> 1:18:17.680
 I am disappointed I made a PhD in phosphine when people aren't doing PhDs in giraffes.

1:18:17.680 --> 1:18:19.440
 We do not know enough about giraffes.

1:18:19.440 --> 1:18:22.680
 I think it was like Ricky Gervais that did a whole, like a long thing.

1:18:22.680 --> 1:18:25.080
 You can't trust Ricky Gervais to talk about giraffes.

1:18:25.080 --> 1:18:26.560
 That is not his expertise.

1:18:26.560 --> 1:18:27.560
 Yeah.

1:18:27.560 --> 1:18:31.600
 But it's a stupid necks, it doesn't make any sense.

1:18:31.600 --> 1:18:32.600
 I mean, that's fine.

1:18:32.600 --> 1:18:36.880
 Giraffes are very resourceful animals who do incredible things and can kick a lion in

1:18:36.880 --> 1:18:37.880
 the face.

1:18:37.880 --> 1:18:38.880
 Why don't you climb the tree?

1:18:38.880 --> 1:18:39.880
 Why don't you climb the tree?

1:18:39.880 --> 1:18:42.480
 You don't need to grow through the lengthy evolutionary process.

1:18:42.480 --> 1:18:43.480
 You're shitting on giraffes.

1:18:43.480 --> 1:18:44.480
 Okay.

1:18:44.480 --> 1:18:45.480
 Giraffes are wondrous animals.

1:18:45.480 --> 1:18:46.480
 Fine.

1:18:46.480 --> 1:18:47.480
 I would very appreciate it.

1:18:47.480 --> 1:18:48.480
 Take it back.

1:18:48.480 --> 1:18:49.480
 I take it back.

1:18:49.480 --> 1:18:50.480
 I apologize.

1:18:50.480 --> 1:18:54.280
 I trust your expertise on this.

1:18:54.280 --> 1:19:01.560
 The thing that makes humans really fascinating, and I think the earth, but I'm a human, is

1:19:01.560 --> 1:19:09.400
 we create things that are, yes, there's all the ugliness in the world.

1:19:09.400 --> 1:19:16.200
 There's all the, on the biological, on the chemical level, there's the pollution, but

1:19:16.200 --> 1:19:18.500
 we create beauty.

1:19:18.500 --> 1:19:23.840
 If you even from a physics perspective, look at symmetry as somehow capturing beauty, the

1:19:23.840 --> 1:19:28.320
 breaking of symmetries, stuff grounded in all the different definitions of symmetry,

1:19:28.320 --> 1:19:31.540
 we're good at creating things.

1:19:31.540 --> 1:19:35.020
 So are spiders.

1:19:35.020 --> 1:19:36.020
 But not giraffes.

1:19:36.020 --> 1:19:37.020
 Okay.

1:19:37.020 --> 1:19:38.020
 But yes, this is a...

1:19:38.020 --> 1:19:39.020
 Spiders.

1:19:39.020 --> 1:19:43.360
 Spiders that create little bubbles of air so they can breathe underwater, they can literally

1:19:43.360 --> 1:19:44.360
 scuba dive.

1:19:44.360 --> 1:19:48.440
 There are spiders that can create parachutes so they can glide.

1:19:48.440 --> 1:19:51.240
 And talk about symmetry, look what spiders can do.

1:19:51.240 --> 1:19:56.680
 And I just thought of spiders, but if I was an alien species coming to earth, there'll

1:19:56.680 --> 1:20:05.600
 be plenty to wonder, and we would just be one of the things, clunky, naked monkey.

1:20:05.600 --> 1:20:07.680
 The ants might be even more fascinating.

1:20:07.680 --> 1:20:08.680
 The ants.

1:20:08.680 --> 1:20:14.680
 The ants can figure out exactly through some emergent consciousness what the maximum distance

1:20:14.680 --> 1:20:22.000
 between their trash, their babies, and their food is just from without any of them knowing

1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:23.000
 how to do this.

1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:24.720
 And collectively they've learned how to do this.

1:20:24.720 --> 1:20:27.200
 If I was an alien species, I'll be looking at that.

1:20:27.200 --> 1:20:29.200
 Well, so that was the other thing I was going to mention.

1:20:29.200 --> 1:20:35.840
 The second thing is I tend to believe we can engineer consciousness, but at the basic level,

1:20:35.840 --> 1:20:42.600
 in the source of consciousness, because if consciousness is unique to humans, and if

1:20:42.600 --> 1:20:47.800
 we can engineer it, that gives me hope that it could be present elsewhere in the universe.

1:20:47.800 --> 1:20:53.600
 That's the other thing that makes, it's an open question, that makes humans perhaps special

1:20:53.600 --> 1:21:00.260
 is not maybe the presence of consciousness, but somehow a presence of elevated consciousness.

1:21:00.260 --> 1:21:04.800
 It does, again, maybe human centric, but it feels like we're more conscious than giraffes,

1:21:04.800 --> 1:21:06.360
 for example, and spiders.

1:21:06.360 --> 1:21:08.960
 Yes, I won't deny that.

1:21:08.960 --> 1:21:10.440
 There is something special about humans.

1:21:10.440 --> 1:21:12.440
 They're my favorite species.

1:21:12.440 --> 1:21:14.160
 They are.

1:21:14.160 --> 1:21:16.080
 They are.

1:21:16.080 --> 1:21:21.720
 Some of my best friends are humans.

1:21:21.720 --> 1:21:24.240
 I think highly of humans.

1:21:24.240 --> 1:21:25.240
 It's great.

1:21:25.240 --> 1:21:31.160
 I just don't have great hope for our longevity, and specifically I don't have great hope given

1:21:31.160 --> 1:21:35.520
 that we're the only species that are five billion that did this cool consciousness trick.

1:21:35.520 --> 1:21:42.240
 I just, I don't want to bet on finding a kinship elsewhere.

1:21:42.240 --> 1:21:44.040
 That's quite interesting to think about.

1:21:44.040 --> 1:21:51.720
 I don't think I've even considered that possibility that there would be life in the solar system,

1:21:51.720 --> 1:21:57.520
 so that indicates that very possibly life is literally everywhere.

1:21:57.520 --> 1:21:59.600
 Everywhere it can happen, it does.

1:21:59.600 --> 1:22:06.200
 And especially what we're discovering with the exoplanets now, how numerous they are,

1:22:06.200 --> 1:22:12.200
 or earthlike habitable, quote unquote, planets, they're everywhere.

1:22:12.200 --> 1:22:16.620
 The most common type of planet is rocky, it seems.

1:22:16.620 --> 1:22:21.880
 But I didn't consider the possibility that life is literally everywhere, and yet intelligent

1:22:21.880 --> 1:22:30.600
 life is nowhere long enough to communicate with each other, to form little clusters of

1:22:30.600 --> 1:22:35.680
 civilizations that expand beyond the solar system and so on.

1:22:35.680 --> 1:22:43.800
 Man, maybe becoming a multi planetary species is a less likely pursuit than we imagine.

1:22:43.800 --> 1:22:44.800
 I agree.

1:22:44.800 --> 1:22:49.040
 But one of the things that makes humans beautiful is we hope.

1:22:49.040 --> 1:22:56.620
 What I hope for humanity, and one of the things I hope for is that we become less obsessed

1:22:56.620 --> 1:23:03.360
 with conquering, and we become less obsessed with spreading ourselves.

1:23:03.360 --> 1:23:08.880
 I hope that we transcend that, that we're happy with the universe without having to

1:23:08.880 --> 1:23:11.240
 go and take it.

1:23:11.240 --> 1:23:18.060
 So you can hope for the species without hoping for a multi planetary existence.

1:23:18.060 --> 1:23:26.840
 That is only, I think, the drive of our most primitive instincts to go and take, to go

1:23:26.840 --> 1:23:28.240
 and plant a flag somewhere.

1:23:28.240 --> 1:23:31.060
 We love planting a flag somewhere.

1:23:31.060 --> 1:23:35.340
 And maybe we could overcome that minor drive.

1:23:35.340 --> 1:23:41.480
 And once we do, the AI systems we build will destroy us because we're too peaceful, and

1:23:41.480 --> 1:23:43.720
 they will go and conquer and plant the flags.

1:23:43.720 --> 1:23:44.720
 Best of luck to them.

1:23:44.720 --> 1:23:50.880
 Rock roaches will be happy to keep to the business as they always have.

1:23:50.880 --> 1:23:58.240
 I tend to believe that robots can have the same elegance and consciousness and all the

1:23:58.240 --> 1:24:02.760
 qualities of kindness and love and hope and fear that humans have.

1:24:02.760 --> 1:24:05.160
 In principle, they could, yes.

1:24:05.160 --> 1:24:10.700
 I don't really trust the people who make them.

1:24:10.700 --> 1:24:13.040
 This is about the giraffe comment, isn't it?

1:24:13.040 --> 1:24:18.440
 I haven't forgiven you for shitting on giraffes, whatever they've done to you.

1:24:18.440 --> 1:24:22.480
 Just as a small tangent, your master's thesis is also fascinating.

1:24:22.480 --> 1:24:25.040
 Maybe we could talk about it for just a little bit.

1:24:25.040 --> 1:24:30.080
 It's titled Influence of a Star's Evolution on its Planetary System.

1:24:30.080 --> 1:24:35.240
 So this interplay between a star and a planet, is there something interesting you could say

1:24:35.240 --> 1:24:42.400
 about what you've learned about this journey that a star takes and the planets around it?

1:24:42.400 --> 1:24:49.040
 Well, when I was younger and I was told what would happen ultimately to the Earth as the

1:24:49.040 --> 1:24:57.680
 sun expands towards a red giant and mercury would just like fall in and then Venus fall

1:24:57.680 --> 1:24:59.840
 in and the sun doesn't care.

1:24:59.840 --> 1:25:05.720
 And it just seemed so, I felt so small.

1:25:05.720 --> 1:25:10.480
 I felt like the Earth and everything on it, it's just the universe doesn't care.

1:25:10.480 --> 1:25:12.400
 Even our sun doesn't care.

1:25:12.400 --> 1:25:17.800
 And I think I felt like our sun should feel some sort of responsibility for its planets.

1:25:17.800 --> 1:25:21.280
 And it just felt like such a violent and neglectful parent.

1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:23.360
 It's like a parent eating its own children.

1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:24.360
 It's horrible.

1:25:24.360 --> 1:25:31.000
 It's just a horrible notion, but it made me think, what if there's some sort of generation?

1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:36.360
 And so at the time when I was doing my master's, there was a notion of the white dwarf cemetery,

1:25:36.360 --> 1:25:41.400
 which is this idea that when stars become white dwarfs, that death is so horrible that

1:25:41.400 --> 1:25:45.720
 planets, potentially habitable planets that could have been habitable before, they're

1:25:45.720 --> 1:25:46.720
 now gone.

1:25:46.720 --> 1:25:48.720
 There's no chance for life.

1:25:48.720 --> 1:25:52.320
 But then I thought, what if life returns?

1:25:52.320 --> 1:25:55.280
 Now it's a white dwarf, it's calmed down, it's not going to go anywhere.

1:25:55.280 --> 1:25:59.680
 White dwarfs are very stable across like universal timescales.

1:25:59.680 --> 1:26:05.400
 And so could you have planets around the white dwarf that could themselves get life again?

1:26:05.400 --> 1:26:07.960
 No, life doesn't care.

1:26:07.960 --> 1:26:14.400
 And so my work was basically killing dozens of planets, thousands of times.

1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:18.400
 I just ran thousands and thousands of end body simulations.

1:26:18.400 --> 1:26:19.720
 Oh, you simulated this?

1:26:19.720 --> 1:26:20.720
 Yeah.

1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:26.920
 So I simulated the star growing and just eating all these planets up and just absolute chaos.

1:26:26.920 --> 1:26:29.960
 The orbits of the planets would change as the star loses mass.

1:26:29.960 --> 1:26:34.800
 So you would have like Jupiter planets just crashing into the other planets, throwing

1:26:34.800 --> 1:26:36.480
 them into the sun early.

1:26:36.480 --> 1:26:40.720
 It was terrifying to watch these simulations.

1:26:40.720 --> 1:26:44.680
 It was absolute carnage.

1:26:44.680 --> 1:26:50.400
 But if you run thousands of these simulations, some systems find new balance ways of staying

1:26:50.400 --> 1:26:52.000
 alive.

1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:59.640
 Some systems post star death find stable orbits again for billions of years, more than enough

1:26:59.640 --> 1:27:01.840
 for life to originate again.

1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:09.480
 And so that was my idea during that time that Thesis was trying to explore this notion of

1:27:09.480 --> 1:27:12.280
 life coming back.

1:27:12.280 --> 1:27:18.160
 And this idea of the universe doesn't care if you're here or not, and it will go about

1:27:18.160 --> 1:27:19.160
 its business.

1:27:19.160 --> 1:27:23.460
 Andromeda will crash into us and doesn't care.

1:27:23.460 --> 1:27:25.880
 No one cares if you're alive in the universe.

1:27:25.880 --> 1:27:31.080
 And so letting go of that preciousness of life, I found very useful at that stage of

1:27:31.080 --> 1:27:32.080
 my career.

1:27:32.080 --> 1:27:38.520
 And instead, I just thought, if life is inevitable, it doesn't matter that it came by four billion

1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:39.520
 years ago.

1:27:39.520 --> 1:27:41.760
 It can start again four billion years later.

1:27:41.760 --> 1:27:44.200
 And maybe that is nice.

1:27:44.200 --> 1:27:49.200
 Maybe that's where hope lies, the Phoenix rising everywhere.

1:27:49.200 --> 1:27:56.240
 Planets being destroyed and created and we're here now and others will be more or less hereish

1:27:56.240 --> 1:27:57.640
 billions of years later.

1:27:57.640 --> 1:28:02.360
 So accepting the cycle of death and life and yeah.

1:28:02.360 --> 1:28:03.360
 Not taking it personally.

1:28:03.360 --> 1:28:05.000
 Not taking it personally.

1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:06.480
 The sun doesn't owe us anything.

1:28:06.480 --> 1:28:08.240
 It's not a bad parent.

1:28:08.240 --> 1:28:10.360
 It's not a parent at all.

1:28:10.360 --> 1:28:11.360
 Yeah.

1:28:11.360 --> 1:28:18.600
 I was looking at the work of Freeman Dyson and seeing how this universe eventually will

1:28:18.600 --> 1:28:22.760
 just be a bunch of supermassive black holes before they also evaporate.

1:28:22.760 --> 1:28:24.680
 A bunch of tiny black holes too.

1:28:24.680 --> 1:28:25.680
 Yeah.

1:28:25.680 --> 1:28:26.680
 Absolute quiet.

1:28:26.680 --> 1:28:30.920
 Everyone, all the black holes a little too far away from one another to even interact

1:28:30.920 --> 1:28:34.640
 until it's just silence forever.

1:28:34.640 --> 1:28:40.680
 But until then, many, many cycles of death and destruction and rebirth.

1:28:40.680 --> 1:28:42.400
 And rebirth.

1:28:42.400 --> 1:28:44.960
 You kept bringing up sort of coding stuff up.

1:28:44.960 --> 1:28:47.000
 I wanted to ask two things.

1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:52.280
 First of all, what programming language do you like?

1:28:52.280 --> 1:29:05.520
 And also what, because you're as a computational quantum astrochemist, no, yes, that's right.

1:29:05.520 --> 1:29:11.480
 You're kind of, you could say you're actually understanding some exceptionally complicated

1:29:11.480 --> 1:29:18.120
 things with one of the things you're using is the tools of computation of programming.

1:29:18.120 --> 1:29:24.280
 Is there a device you can give to people, because I know quite a few that have not practiced

1:29:24.280 --> 1:29:28.800
 that tool and have fallen in love with a particular science, whatever it's biology and chemistry

1:29:28.800 --> 1:29:30.840
 and physics and so on.

1:29:30.840 --> 1:29:37.080
 And if they were interested in learning to program and learning to use computation as

1:29:37.080 --> 1:29:41.680
 a tool in their particular science, is there advice you can give on programming and also

1:29:41.680 --> 1:29:48.200
 just maybe a comment on your own journey and the use of programming in your own life?

1:29:48.200 --> 1:29:50.920
 Well, I'm a terrible programmer.

1:29:50.920 --> 1:29:55.360
 A lot of scientists, their programming is bad because we never learned formal programming.

1:29:55.360 --> 1:29:58.040
 We learned science, physics, chemistry.

1:29:58.040 --> 1:30:03.040
 And then we were told, oh, you can, you have to get these equations modeled and run through

1:30:03.040 --> 1:30:04.040
 a simulation.

1:30:04.040 --> 1:30:07.500
 And you're like, oh, okay, so I'm going to learn how to code to do this.

1:30:07.500 --> 1:30:12.040
 And you learn just as much as you need to run these simulations and no more.

1:30:12.040 --> 1:30:15.160
 So they're rarely optimized and they're really clunky.

1:30:15.160 --> 1:30:17.240
 Six months later, you can't read your own code.

1:30:17.240 --> 1:30:19.360
 My variable names are extremely embarrassing.

1:30:19.360 --> 1:30:26.880
 I still have error messages for different compilation errors that say things like, at

1:30:26.880 --> 1:30:29.600
 least your dad loves you, Clara.

1:30:29.600 --> 1:30:32.600
 You know, it doesn't help me at all.

1:30:32.600 --> 1:30:36.680
 Just like you suck at coding, but there's other things in your life.

1:30:36.680 --> 1:30:37.880
 So I'm a bad programmer.

1:30:37.880 --> 1:30:41.240
 And so, you know, if that will give hope to anyone else who's a bad programmer, I can

1:30:41.240 --> 1:30:44.360
 still do pretty impressive science.

1:30:44.360 --> 1:30:48.880
 But I learned, I think I started learning MATLAB and Java when I was in college.

1:30:48.880 --> 1:30:50.720
 It did me no good at all.

1:30:50.720 --> 1:30:52.480
 It has not been particularly useful.

1:30:52.480 --> 1:30:58.200
 I learned some Fortran that was very useful, even though it's really not a fun language

1:30:58.200 --> 1:31:02.680
 because so much of legacy code is in Fortran.

1:31:02.680 --> 1:31:08.240
 And so if you want to use other people's code who have now retired, Fortran will be nice.

1:31:08.240 --> 1:31:10.160
 And then I used IDL to visualize.

1:31:10.160 --> 1:31:14.960
 So that simulation and body simulation, those all Fortran and IDL.

1:31:14.960 --> 1:31:19.520
 But thankfully, since I've left college, I've just learned Python like a normal person and

1:31:19.520 --> 1:31:21.600
 that has been much nicer.

1:31:21.600 --> 1:31:24.360
 So most of my code now is in Python.

1:31:24.360 --> 1:31:26.840
 I should also make a few quick comments as well.

1:31:26.840 --> 1:31:30.680
 So one is, you say you're sort of bad at programming.

1:31:30.680 --> 1:31:36.880
 I've worked with a lot of excellent scientists that are quote unquote bad at programming.

1:31:36.880 --> 1:31:37.880
 They're not.

1:31:37.880 --> 1:31:38.880
 It gets the job done.

1:31:38.880 --> 1:31:45.680
 In fact, there's a downside to sort of, especially getting a software engineering education.

1:31:45.680 --> 1:31:50.520
 If I were to give advice, especially if you're doing a computer science degree and you're

1:31:50.520 --> 1:31:58.280
 doing software engineering, is not to get lost in the optimization of the correct, there's

1:31:58.280 --> 1:32:04.000
 an obsession, you could see it in like Stack Overflow, of the correct way to do things.

1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:11.000
 And I think you can too easily get lost in constantly trying to optimize and do things

1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:13.440
 the correct way when you actually never get done.

1:32:13.440 --> 1:32:19.960
 The same thing happens, you have like communities of people obsessed with productivity and they

1:32:19.960 --> 1:32:25.440
 keep researching productivity hacks and then they spend like 90% plus of their time figuring

1:32:25.440 --> 1:32:29.560
 out how to do things productively and then never actually do anything.

1:32:29.560 --> 1:32:34.320
 So there's a certain sense if you focus on the task that needs to be done, that's what

1:32:34.320 --> 1:32:35.520
 programming is for.

1:32:35.520 --> 1:32:43.760
 So not over optimizing, not thinking about variable names in the following sense.

1:32:43.760 --> 1:32:47.440
 Sometimes you think, okay, I'm going to write code that's going to last for decades.

1:32:47.440 --> 1:32:53.180
 In reality, your code, if it's well written or poorly written, will be very likely obsolete

1:32:53.180 --> 1:32:54.760
 very quickly.

1:32:54.760 --> 1:32:57.600
 The point is to get the job done really well.

1:32:57.600 --> 1:33:02.320
 So there's a trade off there that you have to make sure to strike.

1:33:02.320 --> 1:33:08.560
 I should also comment as a public service announcement or a request, if there's any

1:33:08.560 --> 1:33:13.120
 world class Fortran or Cobalt programmers out there, I'm looking for them, I want to

1:33:13.120 --> 1:33:14.120
 talk to you.

1:33:14.120 --> 1:33:18.000
 That will not be me, I'm a terrible Fortran programmer.

1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:23.480
 But it's fascinating because so much of the world in the past and still runs programming

1:33:23.480 --> 1:33:26.400
 languages and there's no experts on it.

1:33:26.400 --> 1:33:28.760
 They're all retiring.

1:33:28.760 --> 1:33:33.480
 I disagree slightly in that I think because I can get the job done, I'm a programmer.

1:33:33.480 --> 1:33:37.880
 But because no one else can look at my code and know how I got my job done, I'm a bad

1:33:37.880 --> 1:33:38.880
 programmer.

1:33:38.880 --> 1:33:39.880
 That's how I'm defining it.

1:33:39.880 --> 1:33:40.880
 Including yourself.

1:33:40.880 --> 1:33:44.920
 Including myself six months later, I'm working with a new student right now and she sent

1:33:44.920 --> 1:33:52.720
 me some messages on Slack being like, what is this file that you've got with some functions

1:33:52.720 --> 1:33:53.720
 that run?

1:33:53.720 --> 1:33:59.840
 And I was like, this was from 2018, it wasn't that long ago and I can no longer remember

1:33:59.840 --> 1:34:00.840
 what that code does.

1:34:00.840 --> 1:34:06.480
 I'm going to spend now two days reading through my own code and trying to improve it.

1:34:06.480 --> 1:34:08.520
 And I do think that's frustrating.

1:34:08.520 --> 1:34:15.680
 And so I think my advice to any young people who want to get into astronomy or astrobiology

1:34:15.680 --> 1:34:22.240
 or quantum chemistry is that I certainly find it much easier to teach the science concepts

1:34:22.240 --> 1:34:25.840
 to a programmer than the programming to a scientist.

1:34:25.840 --> 1:34:33.080
 And so I would much, much faster hire someone who knows programming but barely knows where

1:34:33.080 --> 1:34:37.440
 space is than teach programming to an astronomer.

1:34:37.440 --> 1:34:39.000
 Oh, that's fascinating.

1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:40.000
 Yeah.

1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:41.000
 Okay.

1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:42.000
 This is true.

1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:43.000
 I mean, yeah, there's some basics.

1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:47.920
 I'm focusing too much on the silver lining because the people that write MATLAB code,

1:34:47.920 --> 1:34:52.400
 yeah, single variable, single letter variable names, those kinds of things.

1:34:52.400 --> 1:34:53.960
 And it's accessibility, right?

1:34:53.960 --> 1:34:59.040
 It's I want my code to be open source and it is, it's on GitHub, anyone can download

1:34:59.040 --> 1:35:00.040
 it.

1:35:00.040 --> 1:35:04.160
 But is it really open source if it's written so cryptically, so poorly that no one can

1:35:04.160 --> 1:35:06.240
 really use it to its full functionality?

1:35:06.240 --> 1:35:11.560
 Have I really published my work and that weighs on me?

1:35:11.560 --> 1:35:16.800
 I feel guilty for my own inadequacies as a programmer.

1:35:16.800 --> 1:35:18.040
 But you can only do so much.

1:35:18.040 --> 1:35:20.440
 I've already learned quantum chemistry and astrophysics.

1:35:20.440 --> 1:35:28.000
 So yeah, I mean, there's all kinds of ways to contribute to the world.

1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:32.880
 One of them is publication, but publishing code is a fascinating way to contribute to

1:35:32.880 --> 1:35:38.960
 the world, even if it's very small, very basic element, great code.

1:35:38.960 --> 1:35:44.760
 I guess I was also kind of criticizing the software engineering process versus like,

1:35:44.760 --> 1:35:50.240
 which is a good thing to do is code that's readable, almost like without documentation,

1:35:50.240 --> 1:35:52.760
 it's readable, it's understandable.

1:35:52.760 --> 1:35:55.880
 The variable names, the structure, all those kinds of things.

1:35:55.880 --> 1:35:56.880
 That's the dream.

1:35:56.880 --> 1:35:57.880
 That's the dream.

1:35:57.880 --> 1:35:58.880
 This is a dumb question.

1:35:58.880 --> 1:35:59.880
 What do you, all right.

1:35:59.880 --> 1:36:00.880
 No, no, tell me a dumb question.

1:36:00.880 --> 1:36:01.880
 I want to hear it.

1:36:01.880 --> 1:36:02.880
 Okay.

1:36:02.880 --> 1:36:08.160
 I mean, okay, this is the question about beauty.

1:36:08.160 --> 1:36:09.160
 It's way too general.

1:36:09.160 --> 1:36:10.160
 It's very impossible.

1:36:10.160 --> 1:36:12.240
 It's like asking, what's your favorite band?

1:36:12.240 --> 1:36:13.240
 What's your favorite music band?

1:36:13.240 --> 1:36:15.040
 Oh, I thought you meant wavelength band.

1:36:15.040 --> 1:36:17.520
 I was like, I definitely have favorite wavelength bands.

1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:18.520
 Absolutely.

1:36:18.520 --> 1:36:21.680
 Well, it's hard to narrow it down, huh?

1:36:21.680 --> 1:36:22.680
 Okay.

1:36:22.680 --> 1:36:25.360
 What do you use the most beautiful idea in science?

1:36:25.360 --> 1:36:27.160
 It's not a dumb question.

1:36:27.160 --> 1:36:31.240
 Do you want to try the question again proudly?

1:36:31.240 --> 1:36:32.760
 Okay.

1:36:32.760 --> 1:36:35.240
 I have a really good question to ask you.

1:36:35.240 --> 1:36:36.240
 Okay.

1:36:36.240 --> 1:36:37.240
 Don't oversell it.

1:36:37.240 --> 1:36:42.240
 I've got an okay question to ask you, you know?

1:36:42.240 --> 1:36:49.760
 What do you use the most beautiful idea in science, something you just find inspiring

1:36:49.760 --> 1:37:00.000
 or just maybe the reason you got into science or the reason you think science is cool?

1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:05.480
 My favorite thing about science is kind of the connection between the scales.

1:37:05.480 --> 1:37:11.040
 So when I was little and I wanted to know about space, I really felt that it would make

1:37:11.040 --> 1:37:15.040
 me feel powerful to be able to predict the heavens.

1:37:15.040 --> 1:37:19.520
 Something so much larger than myself that felt really powerful.

1:37:19.520 --> 1:37:23.080
 It was almost a selfish desire and that's what I wanted.

1:37:23.080 --> 1:37:29.560
 There was some control to being able to know exactly what the sky would do.

1:37:29.560 --> 1:37:34.120
 And then as I got older and I got more into astronomy and I didn't just want to know how

1:37:34.120 --> 1:37:35.120
 the stars moved.

1:37:35.120 --> 1:37:38.040
 I wanted to know how the planets around them moved.

1:37:38.040 --> 1:37:41.880
 And then as I got deeper into that field, I really didn't care that much about the planets.

1:37:41.880 --> 1:37:45.280
 I wanted to know about the atmospheres around the planets and then the molecules within

1:37:45.280 --> 1:37:48.480
 those atmospheres and what that might mean.

1:37:48.480 --> 1:37:53.720
 So I ended up shrinking my scale until it was literally the quantum scale.

1:37:53.720 --> 1:37:59.780
 And now all my work, the majority of my work is on this insane quantum scale.

1:37:59.780 --> 1:38:10.000
 And yet I'm using these literal tiny, tiny tools to try and answer the greatest questions

1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:12.980
 that we've ever been able to ask.

1:38:12.980 --> 1:38:20.280
 And this crossing of scales from the quantum to the astronomical, that's so cool, isn't

1:38:20.280 --> 1:38:21.280
 it?

1:38:21.280 --> 1:38:22.280
 Yeah.

1:38:22.280 --> 1:38:24.920
 It spans the entirety, the tiny and the huge.

1:38:24.920 --> 1:38:30.120
 That's the cool thing about, I guess, being a quantum astrochemist is you're using the

1:38:30.120 --> 1:38:35.520
 tools of the tiny to look at the heavenly bodies, the giant stuff.

1:38:35.520 --> 1:38:41.040
 And the potential life out there that this is the thing that connects us, that you can't

1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:45.740
 escape the rules of the quantum world and how universal they themselves are despite

1:38:45.740 --> 1:38:48.040
 being probabilistic.

1:38:48.040 --> 1:38:56.160
 And that makes me feel really pleased to be in science, but in a really humbling way.

1:38:56.160 --> 1:39:00.600
 It's no longer this thirst for power.

1:39:00.600 --> 1:39:05.560
 I feel less special the more work I do, less exceptional the more work I do.

1:39:05.560 --> 1:39:11.200
 I feel like humans and the earth and our place in the universe is less and less exceptional.

1:39:11.200 --> 1:39:14.820
 And yet I feel so much less lonely.

1:39:14.820 --> 1:39:19.680
 And so it's been a really good trade off that I've lost power, but I've gained company.

1:39:19.680 --> 1:39:20.820
 Wow.

1:39:20.820 --> 1:39:21.820
 That's a beautiful answer.

1:39:21.820 --> 1:39:23.680
 I don't think there's a better way to actually end it.

1:39:23.680 --> 1:39:24.680
 You're right.

1:39:24.680 --> 1:39:27.500
 I asked a mediocre question and you came through.

1:39:27.500 --> 1:39:34.100
 You made the question good by a brilliant answer.

1:39:34.100 --> 1:39:39.120
 You're the Michael Jordan and I'll be the Dennis Rodman.

1:39:39.120 --> 1:39:40.880
 I don't know enough about basketball.

1:39:40.880 --> 1:39:44.280
 I mean, literally you've reached the peak of my basketball knowledge because I know

1:39:44.280 --> 1:39:50.120
 that those people are basketball pros, I believe, but only because I watch Space Jam, I think.

1:39:50.120 --> 1:39:53.680
 Are there books or movies in your life?

1:39:53.680 --> 1:39:59.000
 Long ago or recently, do you have any time for books and movies had an impact on you?

1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:02.040
 What ideas did you take away?

1:40:02.040 --> 1:40:04.200
 I absolutely have time for books and movies.

1:40:04.200 --> 1:40:08.880
 I try as best I can to not work very hard.

1:40:08.880 --> 1:40:09.880
 I mostly fail.

1:40:09.880 --> 1:40:11.320
 I should point out.

1:40:11.320 --> 1:40:18.000
 But I think I'm a better scientist when I don't work evenings and weekends.

1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:21.080
 If I get four good hours in a day, I often don't.

1:40:21.080 --> 1:40:28.020
 I often get eight crappy hours, emails, meetings, bad code, data processing.

1:40:28.020 --> 1:40:33.640
 But if I can get four high quality scientific hours, I just stop working for the day because

1:40:33.640 --> 1:40:35.840
 I know it's diminishing returns after that.

1:40:35.840 --> 1:40:37.400
 So I have a lot of time.

1:40:37.400 --> 1:40:40.280
 I try to make as much time as I can.

1:40:40.280 --> 1:40:50.560
 Can you kind of dig into what it takes to be, one, productive, two, to be happy as a

1:40:50.560 --> 1:40:51.560
 researcher?

1:40:51.560 --> 1:40:58.280
 Because I think it's too easy in that world because you have so many hats, you have to

1:40:58.280 --> 1:41:05.000
 wear so many jobs, you have to be a mentor, a teacher, a head of a research group to research

1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:06.000
 yourself.

1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:15.400
 You have to do service, all the kinds of stuff you're doing now with education and interviews.

1:41:15.400 --> 1:41:22.480
 So as a public science, like being a public communicator, that's a job.

1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:23.480
 The whole thing.

1:41:23.480 --> 1:41:24.480
 Pays very poorly.

1:41:24.480 --> 1:41:28.520
 I'll pay you in Bitcoin.

1:41:28.520 --> 1:41:29.520
 Okay.

1:41:29.520 --> 1:41:33.360
 I'll take Bitcoin.

1:41:33.360 --> 1:41:41.800
 So is there some advice you can give to the process of being productive and happy as a

1:41:41.800 --> 1:41:42.800
 researcher?

1:41:42.800 --> 1:41:47.480
 I think, sadly, it's very hard to feel happy as a scientist if you're not productive.

1:41:47.480 --> 1:41:53.000
 It's a bit of a trap, but I certainly find it very difficult to feel happy when I'm not

1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:54.800
 being productive.

1:41:54.800 --> 1:41:56.140
 It's become slightly better.

1:41:56.140 --> 1:41:59.840
 If I know my students are being productive, I can be happy.

1:41:59.840 --> 1:42:05.600
 But I think a lot of senior scientists, once they get into that mindset, they start thinking

1:42:05.600 --> 1:42:07.600
 that their student science is theirs.

1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:10.840
 And I think this happens a lot with senior scientists.

1:42:10.840 --> 1:42:14.680
 They have so many hats, as you mentioned, they have to do so much service and so much

1:42:14.680 --> 1:42:18.900
 admin, that they have very little time for their own science.

1:42:18.900 --> 1:42:24.000
 And so they end up feeling ownership over the junior people in their labs and their

1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:25.000
 groups.

1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:26.000
 And that's really heartbreaking.

1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:28.940
 I see it all the time.

1:42:28.940 --> 1:42:31.960
 And that, I think I've escaped that trap.

1:42:31.960 --> 1:42:38.360
 I feel so happy, even when I'm not productive, when my students are productive.

1:42:38.360 --> 1:42:44.160
 I think that sensation I was describing earlier of they only need to be half as productive

1:42:44.160 --> 1:42:50.640
 as me for me to feel like I've done my job for humanity.

1:42:50.640 --> 1:42:55.240
 So that has been the dynamic I've had to worry about.

1:42:55.240 --> 1:42:58.400
 But to be productive is not clear to me what you have to do.

1:42:58.400 --> 1:42:59.720
 You have to not be miserable otherwise.

1:42:59.720 --> 1:43:06.640
 I find it extremely hard when I'm having conflicts with collaborators, for example, kind of very

1:43:06.640 --> 1:43:08.500
 hard to enjoy the work we do.

1:43:08.500 --> 1:43:16.040
 Even if the work is this fantastical phosphine or things that I know I love, still very difficult.

1:43:16.040 --> 1:43:22.760
 So I think choosing your collaborators based on how well you get along with them is a really

1:43:22.760 --> 1:43:26.140
 sound scientific choice.

1:43:26.140 --> 1:43:29.560
 Being a miserable collaborator ruins your whole life.

1:43:29.560 --> 1:43:30.560
 It's horrible.

1:43:30.560 --> 1:43:32.240
 It makes you not want to do the science.

1:43:32.240 --> 1:43:35.700
 It probably makes you do clumsy science because you don't focus on it.

1:43:35.700 --> 1:43:37.400
 You don't go over it several times.

1:43:37.400 --> 1:43:39.560
 You just want it to be over.

1:43:39.560 --> 1:43:47.880
 And so I think in general, just not being a douchebag can get so much good science done.

1:43:47.880 --> 1:43:51.520
 Just find the good people in your community and collaborate with them.

1:43:51.520 --> 1:43:55.040
 Even if they're not as good scientists as others, you'll get better science out.

1:43:55.040 --> 1:43:59.520
 Yeah, don't be a douchebag yourself and surround yourself by other cool people.

1:43:59.520 --> 1:44:00.520
 Exactly.

1:44:00.520 --> 1:44:04.680
 And then you'll get better science than if you would try to work with three geniuses

1:44:04.680 --> 1:44:07.760
 who are just hell to be around.

1:44:07.760 --> 1:44:08.760
 Yeah.

1:44:08.760 --> 1:44:12.080
 I mean, there's parallel things like that.

1:44:12.080 --> 1:44:14.720
 I'm very fortunate now.

1:44:14.720 --> 1:44:18.920
 I was very fortunate at MIT to have friends and colleagues there that were incredible

1:44:18.920 --> 1:44:19.920
 to work with.

1:44:19.920 --> 1:44:29.160
 But I'm currently sort of, I'm doing a lot of fun stuff on the side, like this little

1:44:29.160 --> 1:44:35.360
 podcast thing and I mentioned to you, I think, robotics related stuff.

1:44:35.360 --> 1:44:41.440
 I was just at Boston Dynamics yesterday checking out their robots.

1:44:41.440 --> 1:44:46.320
 And I'm currently, I guess, hiring people to help me with a very fun little project

1:44:46.320 --> 1:44:47.320
 around those robots.

1:44:47.320 --> 1:44:48.320
 Want to put an ad in?

1:44:48.320 --> 1:44:49.320
 No.

1:44:49.320 --> 1:44:53.800
 I have more applications I can possibly deal with, there's thousands.

1:44:53.800 --> 1:44:57.680
 So it's not an ad, it's the opposite.

1:44:57.680 --> 1:45:00.640
 We need to put an ad out for someone to help you go through the applications.

1:45:00.640 --> 1:45:03.440
 Well, that too is already there.

1:45:03.440 --> 1:45:04.840
 Over 10,000 people apply for that.

1:45:04.840 --> 1:45:09.560
 An infinite Master Yoshika doll of application management.

1:45:09.560 --> 1:45:16.800
 But the point is, it's not exactly, the point is, like what I'm very distinctly aware of

1:45:16.800 --> 1:45:26.440
 is life is short and productivity is not the right goal to optimize for, at least for me.

1:45:26.440 --> 1:45:32.440
 The right goal to optimize for is how happy you are to wake up in the day and to work

1:45:32.440 --> 1:45:34.120
 with the people that you do.

1:45:34.120 --> 1:45:36.360
 Because the productivity will take care of itself.

1:45:36.360 --> 1:45:37.360
 Agreed.

1:45:37.360 --> 1:45:42.320
 And so like, it's so important to select the people well.

1:45:42.320 --> 1:45:46.520
 And I think one of the challenges with academia, as opposed to sort of the thing I'm currently

1:45:46.520 --> 1:45:51.880
 doing is, like, saying goodbye is sometimes a little bit tougher.

1:45:51.880 --> 1:45:58.400
 Because your colleagues are there, I mean, their goodbye hurts.

1:45:58.400 --> 1:46:02.200
 And then if you have to spend the rest, you know, for many years to come, still surrounded

1:46:02.200 --> 1:46:04.540
 by them in the community, it's tougher.

1:46:04.540 --> 1:46:13.440
 It kind of adds, puts extra pressure to stay in that relationship, in that collaboration.

1:46:13.440 --> 1:46:17.080
 And in some sense, that makes it much more difficult, but it's still worth it.

1:46:17.080 --> 1:46:25.360
 It's still worth it to break ties if you don't, if you're not happy, if there's not that magic,

1:46:25.360 --> 1:46:26.360
 that dance.

1:46:26.360 --> 1:46:30.800
 I talked to this guy named Daniel Kahneman.

1:46:30.800 --> 1:46:32.000
 Oh, I know.

1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:33.000
 Danny Kahneman.

1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:34.000
 Danny, yeah.

1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:39.360
 Boy, did that guy make me realize, like, what a great collaborator is.

1:46:39.360 --> 1:46:41.720
 Well, he had Tversky, right?

1:46:41.720 --> 1:46:42.720
 Yeah.

1:46:42.720 --> 1:46:48.480
 So they had, obviously, they had a really deep collaboration there, but, like, I collaborated

1:46:48.480 --> 1:46:53.160
 with him on a conversation, like, just, like, talking about, I don't know what we're talking

1:46:53.160 --> 1:46:54.160
 about.

1:46:54.160 --> 1:46:59.560
 I think cars, autonomous vehicles, but the brainstorming session, I'm like a nobody.

1:46:59.560 --> 1:47:04.280
 And the fact that he would, with that childlike curiosity and that dance of thoughts and ideas

1:47:04.280 --> 1:47:09.720
 and the push and pull and the, like, and the lack of ego, but then enough ego to have a

1:47:09.720 --> 1:47:13.800
 little bit of a stubbornness over an idea and a little bit of humor and all those things,

1:47:13.800 --> 1:47:19.440
 it's like, holy shit, that person, also the ability to truly listen to another human,

1:47:19.440 --> 1:47:23.560
 it's like, okay, that's what it takes to be a good collaborator.

1:47:23.560 --> 1:47:27.840
 It made me realize that I haven't been, I've been very fortunate to have cool people in

1:47:27.840 --> 1:47:30.960
 my life, but there's, like, levels even to the cool.

1:47:30.960 --> 1:47:34.400
 Yeah, I don't think you can compete with Danny Kahneman on cool.

1:47:34.400 --> 1:47:36.400
 He's just incredible.

1:47:36.400 --> 1:47:41.400
 Everybody was like, okay, I guess what I'm trying to say is that collaboration is an

1:47:41.400 --> 1:47:47.440
 art form, but perhaps it's actually a skill, is allowing yourself to develop that skill

1:47:47.440 --> 1:47:50.160
 because that's one of the fruitful skills.

1:47:50.160 --> 1:47:56.240
 And praise it in students, you know, and I think it is something you can really improve

1:47:56.240 --> 1:47:57.240
 on.

1:47:57.240 --> 1:47:59.680
 I've become a better collaborator as the years have gone on.

1:47:59.680 --> 1:48:03.240
 I don't have some innate collaborative skills.

1:48:03.240 --> 1:48:10.080
 I think they're skills I've developed, and I think in science there's this really destructive

1:48:10.080 --> 1:48:15.000
 notion of the lone wolf, the scientist who sees things where others don't, you know,

1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:19.120
 then that's really appealing and people really like either fulfilling that or pretending

1:48:19.120 --> 1:48:21.360
 to be fulfilling that.

1:48:21.360 --> 1:48:25.480
 And first of all, it's mostly a lie.

1:48:25.480 --> 1:48:30.640
 Any modern scientist, particularly in astronomy, which is so interdisciplinary, any modern scientist

1:48:30.640 --> 1:48:36.760
 that's doing it on their own is doing a crappy job most likely because you need an independent

1:48:36.760 --> 1:48:39.000
 set of eyes to help you do things.

1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:43.960
 You need experts in the sub fields that you're working on to check your work.

1:48:43.960 --> 1:48:49.840
 But most importantly, it's just a bad idea.

1:48:49.840 --> 1:48:54.120
 It doesn't lead to good science and it leaves you miserable.

1:48:54.120 --> 1:48:58.920
 I was recently, I had some work that I was avoiding and I thought maybe I should pursue

1:48:58.920 --> 1:49:03.200
 the scientific project because I don't care enough about the outcome and it's going to

1:49:03.200 --> 1:49:04.200
 be a lot of hard work.

1:49:04.200 --> 1:49:07.720
 And I was trying to balance these two things to be really difficult.

1:49:07.720 --> 1:49:12.400
 And the outcome is that maybe 10 people will cite me in the next decade because it's not,

1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:16.120
 no one's asking for this question to be answered.

1:49:16.120 --> 1:49:21.000
 And then I found myself working with this collaborator, Jason Dittman.

1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:27.720
 And I spent a whole afternoon hours with him working on this and time flew by and I just

1:49:27.720 --> 1:49:31.960
 felt taller and like I could breathe better.

1:49:31.960 --> 1:49:35.480
 I was happier, I was a better person when it was done.

1:49:35.480 --> 1:49:38.840
 And that's because he's a great collaborator.

1:49:38.840 --> 1:49:43.560
 He's just a wonderful person that brings out joy out of science that you're doing with

1:49:43.560 --> 1:49:45.400
 him.

1:49:45.400 --> 1:49:46.920
 And that's really the trick.

1:49:46.920 --> 1:49:52.240
 You find the people that make you feel that way about the science you're doing and you

1:49:52.240 --> 1:49:55.720
 stop worrying about being the lone wolf.

1:49:55.720 --> 1:50:01.320
 That's just a terrible dream that will leave you miserable and your science will be shit.

1:50:01.320 --> 1:50:08.120
 And since I'm Russian, just murder anybody who doesn't fall into that beautiful collaborative

1:50:08.120 --> 1:50:10.360
 relationship.

1:50:10.360 --> 1:50:11.920
 We were talking about books.

1:50:11.920 --> 1:50:13.420
 Books, yes.

1:50:13.420 --> 1:50:14.420
 Is there books, movies?

1:50:14.420 --> 1:50:16.360
 Why was I talking about my productivity?

1:50:16.360 --> 1:50:18.920
 Oh, you said you maybe don't have time for books and movies.

1:50:18.920 --> 1:50:22.800
 And you said you must make time for books and movies.

1:50:22.800 --> 1:50:24.620
 Make time to not work.

1:50:24.620 --> 1:50:28.160
 Make time to not work whatever that looks like to you.

1:50:28.160 --> 1:50:31.320
 But there's plenty.

1:50:31.320 --> 1:50:36.940
 When I was younger, I found a lot of my scientific fulfillment in books and movies.

1:50:36.940 --> 1:50:43.680
 Now as I got older, I have plenty of that in my work and I try to read outside my field.

1:50:43.680 --> 1:50:47.620
 I read about Danny Kahneman's work instead.

1:50:47.620 --> 1:50:52.080
 But when I was little, it was Contact, the Carl Sagan book.

1:50:52.080 --> 1:50:59.960
 I really thought I was just like Ellie and I was going to become Ellie.

1:50:59.960 --> 1:51:06.600
 I really resonated with me, that character and the notions of life and space and the

1:51:06.600 --> 1:51:07.600
 universe.

1:51:07.600 --> 1:51:17.440
 Even the idea of then the movie came out and I got to put Jodie Foster in that, which helped.

1:51:17.440 --> 1:51:23.740
 But even the notion of if it is just us, what an awful waste of space, I find extremely

1:51:23.740 --> 1:51:30.280
 useful as a concept to think maybe we are special, but that would suck is a really nice

1:51:30.280 --> 1:51:35.720
 way of thinking of the search for life, that it's much better to not be special and have

1:51:35.720 --> 1:51:36.720
 company.

1:51:36.720 --> 1:51:39.440
 I got that from Carl Sagan.

1:51:39.440 --> 1:51:42.080
 So that's where I always recommend.

1:51:42.080 --> 1:51:45.880
 Let me ask one other ridiculous question.

1:51:45.880 --> 1:51:53.120
 We talked about the death and life cycle that is ever present in the universe until it's

1:51:53.120 --> 1:51:58.760
 not, until it's supermassive and little black holes too at the end of the universe.

1:51:58.760 --> 1:52:02.760
 What do you think is the why, the meaning of it all?

1:52:02.760 --> 1:52:09.840
 What do you think is the meaning of life here on Earth and the meaning of that life that

1:52:09.840 --> 1:52:14.280
 you look for, whether it's on Venus or other exoplanets?

1:52:14.280 --> 1:52:16.000
 I think there's none.

1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:19.160
 I find enormous relief in the absence of meaning.

1:52:19.160 --> 1:52:29.240
 I think chasing for meaning is a human desire that the universe doesn't give two shits about.

1:52:29.240 --> 1:52:30.240
 But you still enjoy...

1:52:30.240 --> 1:52:33.320
 I enjoy finding meaning in my life.

1:52:33.320 --> 1:52:38.400
 I enjoy finding where the morality lies.

1:52:38.400 --> 1:52:47.800
 I enjoy the complication of that desire and I feel that is deeply human, but I don't feel

1:52:47.800 --> 1:52:49.760
 that it's universal.

1:52:49.760 --> 1:52:50.760
 It's somehow absolute.

1:52:50.760 --> 1:52:54.080
 Like we conjure it up.

1:52:54.080 --> 1:52:59.880
 We bring it to life through our own minds, but it's not any kind of fundamental way real.

1:52:59.880 --> 1:53:01.240
 No.

1:53:01.240 --> 1:53:07.760
 And the same way the sun is not to be blamed for destroying its own planets.

1:53:07.760 --> 1:53:12.600
 The universe doesn't care because it has no meaning.

1:53:12.600 --> 1:53:14.400
 It owes us nothing.

1:53:14.400 --> 1:53:18.080
 And looking for meaning in the universe is demanding answers.

1:53:18.080 --> 1:53:19.080
 Who are we?

1:53:19.080 --> 1:53:20.080
 We're nothing.

1:53:20.080 --> 1:53:23.280
 We don't get to demand anything and that includes meaning.

1:53:23.280 --> 1:53:28.560
 And I find it very reassuring because once there is no meaning, I don't have to find

1:53:28.560 --> 1:53:30.800
 it.

1:53:30.800 --> 1:53:34.320
 Yeah.

1:53:34.320 --> 1:53:38.240
 Once there's no meaning, it's a kind of freedom in a way.

1:53:38.240 --> 1:53:41.240
 You sound a bit like...

1:53:41.240 --> 1:53:42.240
 I'm happy about it.

1:53:42.240 --> 1:53:44.320
 This isn't a depressing outlook as far as I'm concerned.

1:53:44.320 --> 1:53:45.320
 It's happiness.

1:53:45.320 --> 1:53:46.320
 Yeah.

1:53:46.320 --> 1:53:47.320
 Yeah.

1:53:47.320 --> 1:53:48.320
 So, I mean, there's a...

1:53:48.320 --> 1:53:53.440
 I don't know if you know who Sam Harris is, but he, despite the pushbacks from the entirety

1:53:53.440 --> 1:54:01.880
 of the world, really argues hard that free will is an illusion, that the deterministic

1:54:01.880 --> 1:54:06.880
 universe and it's all already been predetermined and he's okay with it.

1:54:06.880 --> 1:54:11.840
 And he's happy with it, that he's distinctly aware of it.

1:54:11.840 --> 1:54:12.840
 And that's okay.

1:54:12.840 --> 1:54:16.480
 The quantum world will disagree with him on the deterministic nature of nature.

1:54:16.480 --> 1:54:22.540
 Well, he's not saying it's deterministic, but he's saying that the randomness doesn't

1:54:22.540 --> 1:54:24.880
 help either.

1:54:24.880 --> 1:54:31.280
 Randomness does not help in the experience of feeling like you're the decider of your

1:54:31.280 --> 1:54:33.100
 own actions.

1:54:33.100 --> 1:54:40.640
 That he kind of is okay with being a leaf flowing on the river, or being the river,

1:54:40.640 --> 1:54:45.040
 as opposed to having or being like a fish or something that can decide its swimming

1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:46.040
 direction.

1:54:46.040 --> 1:54:48.600
 He's okay just embracing the flow of life.

1:54:48.600 --> 1:54:53.360
 I mean, in that same way, it kind of sounds like your conception of meaning.

1:54:53.360 --> 1:54:56.920
 I mean, it just is.

1:54:56.920 --> 1:54:58.960
 The universe doesn't care.

1:54:58.960 --> 1:55:04.720
 It just is what it is and we experience certain things and some feel good and some don't.

1:55:04.720 --> 1:55:08.400
 And that's life.

1:55:08.400 --> 1:55:10.040
 But I don't feel like that about life.

1:55:10.040 --> 1:55:16.040
 I think life does have meaning and it's laudable to look for that meaning in life.

1:55:16.040 --> 1:55:22.080
 I just don't think you can apply that beyond life and certainly not beyond earth.

1:55:22.080 --> 1:55:31.440
 That this notion of meaning is a human construct and so it only applies within us and the other

1:55:31.440 --> 1:55:40.640
 life forms and planet types that suffer from our intrusions or rejoice from our interactions.

1:55:40.640 --> 1:55:44.820
 But this meaning is ours to do as we please.

1:55:44.820 --> 1:55:49.520
 We created it, we've created a need for it, and so that's our problem to solve.

1:55:49.520 --> 1:55:51.200
 I don't apply it beyond us.

1:55:51.200 --> 1:55:55.640
 I think we as humans have a lot of responsibilities, but they're moral responsibilities.

1:55:55.640 --> 1:55:59.800
 And a lot of those responsibilities are much more easily fulfilled if you find meaning

1:55:59.800 --> 1:56:00.840
 in them.

1:56:00.840 --> 1:56:04.640
 So I think there's value to meaning, whether it's real or not.

1:56:04.640 --> 1:56:11.000
 I just think we gain nothing from trying to anthropomorphize the entire universe.

1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:13.800
 And also that's the height of hubris.

1:56:13.800 --> 1:56:15.360
 That's not for us to do.

1:56:15.360 --> 1:56:16.360
 Yeah.

1:56:16.360 --> 1:56:19.640
 It also could be just like duality and quantum mechanics.

1:56:19.640 --> 1:56:25.600
 It could be both that there is meaning and that there isn't.

1:56:25.600 --> 1:56:32.440
 And we're somehow depending on the observer, depending on the perspective you take on the

1:56:32.440 --> 1:56:33.440
 thing.

1:56:33.440 --> 1:56:38.640
 I mean, even on earth that's true, but whether things have meaning or not depends a lot on

1:56:38.640 --> 1:56:41.640
 who's looking.

1:56:41.640 --> 1:56:45.440
 Whether it's us humans, the aliens or the giraffes.

1:56:45.440 --> 1:56:49.800
 Clara, this was an incredible conversation.

1:56:49.800 --> 1:56:57.160
 I mean, I learned so much, but I also am just inspired by the passion you have in not finding

1:56:57.160 --> 1:57:00.040
 meaning in the universe.

1:57:00.040 --> 1:57:04.240
 I'm very passionate about not finding meaning in the universe.

1:57:04.240 --> 1:57:06.640
 You're the most inspiring nihilist I've ever met.

1:57:06.640 --> 1:57:08.640
 I'm just kidding.

1:57:08.640 --> 1:57:17.480
 You are truly an inspiring communicator of everything from phosphine to life to quantum

1:57:17.480 --> 1:57:18.480
 astrochemistry.

1:57:18.480 --> 1:57:24.440
 I can't wait to see what other cool things you do in your career, in your scientific

1:57:24.440 --> 1:57:25.440
 life.

1:57:25.440 --> 1:57:28.120
 Thank you so much for wasting your valuable time with me today.

1:57:28.120 --> 1:57:30.120
 I really appreciate it.

1:57:30.120 --> 1:57:31.120
 It was my pleasure.

1:57:31.120 --> 1:57:33.880
 I'd already got my four hours of productivity before I got here.

1:57:33.880 --> 1:57:35.240
 And so it's not a waste.

1:57:35.240 --> 1:57:37.320
 It's all downhill from there.

1:57:37.320 --> 1:57:38.320
 Thank you.

1:57:38.320 --> 1:57:41.320
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Clara Sousa Silva.

1:57:41.320 --> 1:57:46.600
 And thank you to Onnit, Grammarly, Blinkist, and Indeed.

1:57:46.600 --> 1:57:50.440
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

1:57:50.440 --> 1:57:54.160
 And now let me leave you with some words from Konstantin Tsiolkovsky.

1:57:54.160 --> 1:58:00.360
 The earth is the cradle of humanity, but mankind cannot stay in the cradle forever.

1:58:00.360 --> 1:58:11.640
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
