00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
 How would you, as a higher intelligence,

00:02.640 --> 00:06.160
 represent yourself to a lesser intelligence?

00:06.160 --> 00:09.760
 Do you think they saw what they say they saw?

00:09.760 --> 00:12.040
 It didn't just start showing up in 1947.

00:12.040 --> 00:13.720
 How hard do you think it is for aliens

00:13.720 --> 00:15.080
 to communicate with humans?

00:15.080 --> 00:15.920
 What do we believe in?

00:15.920 --> 00:16.760
 We believe in technology.

00:16.760 --> 00:20.160
 So you show yourself as a form of technology, right?

00:20.160 --> 00:23.080
 But the common thread is you're not alone.

00:24.020 --> 00:26.220
 And there's something else here with you.

00:26.220 --> 00:31.220
 And there's something that's, as you said, watching you.

00:31.920 --> 00:33.880
 You are a professor at Stanford

00:33.880 --> 00:36.260
 studying the biology of the human organism

00:36.260 --> 00:38.640
 at the level of individual cells.

00:38.640 --> 00:42.120
 So let me ask first the big,

00:42.120 --> 00:43.740
 ridiculous philosophical question.

00:43.740 --> 00:47.000
 What is the most beautiful or fascinating aspect

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
 of human biology at the level of the cell to you?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.800
 The micromachines and the nanomachines

00:52.800 --> 00:54.560
 that proteins make and become,

00:54.560 --> 00:56.760
 that to me is the most interesting.

00:56.760 --> 01:01.760
 The fact that you have this basically dynamic computer

01:02.000 --> 01:04.600
 within every cell that's constantly processing

01:04.600 --> 01:08.400
 its environment, and at the heart of it is DNA,

01:08.400 --> 01:12.760
 which is a dynamic machine, a dynamic computation process.

01:12.760 --> 01:16.640
 People think of the DNA as a linear code.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.600
 It's codes within codes within codes.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.920
 And it is actually the epigenetic state

01:21.920 --> 01:23.920
 that's doing this amazing processing.

01:23.920 --> 01:26.320
 I mean, if you ever wanted to believe in God,

01:26.320 --> 01:28.240
 just look inside the cell.

01:28.240 --> 01:30.820
 So DNA is both information and computer.

01:30.820 --> 01:32.180
 Exactly.

01:32.180 --> 01:34.840
 How did that computer come about?

01:34.840 --> 01:37.280
 A big continuing on the philosophical question.

01:37.280 --> 01:39.440
 Is this both scientific and philosophical?

01:39.440 --> 01:42.360
 How did life originate on Earth, do you think?

01:42.360 --> 01:46.540
 How did this, at every level, so the very first step

01:46.540 --> 01:50.920
 and the fascinating complex computer that is DNA,

01:50.920 --> 01:52.560
 that is multicellular organism,

01:52.560 --> 01:56.120
 and then maybe the fascinating complex computer

01:56.120 --> 01:58.740
 that is the human mind?

01:58.740 --> 02:01.040
 Well, I think you have to take just one more step back

02:01.040 --> 02:04.360
 to the complex computer that is the universe, right?

02:04.360 --> 02:08.320
 All of the so called particles or the waves

02:08.320 --> 02:10.240
 that people think the universe is made of

02:10.240 --> 02:14.560
 and appears, to me at least, to be a computational process.

02:14.560 --> 02:18.160
 And embedded in that is biology, right?

02:18.160 --> 02:21.060
 So all the atoms of a protein, et cetera,

02:21.060 --> 02:23.640
 sit in that computational matrix.

02:23.640 --> 02:26.160
 From my point of view, it's computing something.

02:26.160 --> 02:28.300
 It's computing towards something.

02:28.300 --> 02:31.440
 It was created, in some ways, if you want to believe in God,

02:31.440 --> 02:32.520
 and I don't know that I do,

02:32.520 --> 02:35.000
 but if you want to believe in something,

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
 the universe was created or at least enabled

02:38.000 --> 02:40.880
 to allow for life to form.

02:40.880 --> 02:45.280
 And so the DNA, if you ask, where does DNA come from?

02:45.280 --> 02:47.200
 And you can go all the way back to Richard Dawkins

02:47.200 --> 02:50.720
 and the selfish gene hypothesis.

02:50.720 --> 02:52.640
 The way I look at DNA, though,

02:52.640 --> 02:56.280
 is it is not a moment in time.

02:56.280 --> 02:59.520
 It assumes the context of the body and the environment

02:59.520 --> 03:00.720
 in which it's going to live.

03:00.720 --> 03:04.080
 And so if you want to ask a question of where

03:04.080 --> 03:07.340
 and how does information get stored,

03:07.340 --> 03:10.880
 DNA, although it's only 3 billion base pairs long,

03:10.880 --> 03:14.000
 contains more information than, I think,

03:14.000 --> 03:18.200
 the entire computational memory resources

03:18.200 --> 03:20.240
 of our current technology.

03:20.240 --> 03:24.440
 Because who and what you are is both what you were as an egg

03:24.440 --> 03:27.640
 all the way through to the day you die,

03:27.640 --> 03:29.640
 and it embodies all the different cell types

03:29.640 --> 03:31.660
 and organs in your body.

03:31.660 --> 03:36.480
 And so it's a computational reservoir

03:36.480 --> 03:40.680
 of information and expectation that you will become.

03:40.680 --> 03:43.720
 So actually, I would sort of turn it around a different way

03:43.720 --> 03:46.480
 and say, if you wanted to create

03:46.480 --> 03:50.560
 the best memory storage system possible,

03:50.560 --> 03:53.320
 you could reverse engineer what a human is

03:53.320 --> 03:56.520
 and create a DNA memory system

03:56.520 --> 03:59.840
 that is not just the linear version,

03:59.840 --> 04:03.320
 but is also everything that it could become.

04:03.320 --> 04:04.280
 When we're talking about DNA,

04:04.280 --> 04:06.960
 we're talking about Earth and the environment creating DNA.

04:06.960 --> 04:09.840
 So you're talking about trying to come up

04:09.840 --> 04:12.860
 with an optimal computer for this particular environment.

04:12.860 --> 04:13.700
 Right.

04:13.700 --> 04:17.920
 So if you were to reverse engineer that computer,

04:19.340 --> 04:21.060
 what do you mean by considering

04:21.060 --> 04:22.940
 all the possible things it could become?

04:22.940 --> 04:24.780
 So who you are today, right?

04:24.780 --> 04:27.540
 So 3 billion bits of information

04:27.540 --> 04:31.660
 does not explain Lex Friedman, doesn't explain me, right?

04:31.660 --> 04:35.420
 But the DNA embodies the expectation

04:35.420 --> 04:40.040
 of the environment in which you will live and grow

04:40.040 --> 04:41.380
 and become.

04:41.380 --> 04:44.660
 So all the information that is you, right,

04:44.660 --> 04:48.460
 is actually not only embedded in the DNA,

04:48.460 --> 04:50.060
 but it's embedded in the context

04:50.060 --> 04:55.060
 of the world in which you grow into and develop, right?

04:55.660 --> 04:57.500
 But so all that information though

04:57.500 --> 05:01.740
 is packed in the expectation of what the DNA expects to see.

05:01.740 --> 05:02.580
 Interesting.

05:02.580 --> 05:04.880
 So like some of the information,

05:04.880 --> 05:08.260
 is that accurate to say is stored outside the body?

05:08.260 --> 05:09.860
 Exactly, yeah.

05:09.860 --> 05:11.300
 The information is stored outside

05:11.300 --> 05:13.780
 because there's a context of expectation.

05:13.780 --> 05:14.660
 Isn't that interesting?

05:14.660 --> 05:15.740
 Yeah, it's fascinating.

05:15.740 --> 05:20.380
 I mean, to linger on this point,

05:20.380 --> 05:24.460
 if we were to run Earth over again a million times,

05:24.460 --> 05:26.100
 how many different versions

05:26.100 --> 05:28.060
 of this type of computer would we get?

05:28.060 --> 05:29.860
 I think it would be different each time.

05:29.860 --> 05:33.100
 I mean, if you assume there's no such thing as fate, right,

05:33.100 --> 05:35.340
 and it's not all pre programmed,

05:35.340 --> 05:37.460
 and that there is some sort of, let's say,

05:37.460 --> 05:40.340
 variation or randomness at the beginning,

05:40.340 --> 05:43.860
 you would get as many different versions of life

05:43.860 --> 05:45.380
 as you could imagine.

05:45.380 --> 05:46.940
 And I don't think it would all be

05:46.940 --> 05:50.540
 unless there's something built into the substrate

05:50.540 --> 05:51.380
 of the universe.

05:51.380 --> 05:55.780
 It wouldn't always be left handed proteins, right?

05:55.780 --> 05:58.420
 But I wonder what the flap of a butterfly wing,

05:58.420 --> 06:01.260
 what effects it has,

06:01.260 --> 06:04.660
 because it's possible that this system

06:04.660 --> 06:07.220
 is really good at finding the efficient answer,

06:07.220 --> 06:11.580
 and maybe the efficient answer is,

06:11.580 --> 06:13.460
 there's only a small finite set of them

06:13.460 --> 06:14.820
 for this particular environment.

06:14.820 --> 06:16.020
 Exactly, exactly.

06:16.020 --> 06:19.340
 That's the kind of, in a way, the anthropomorphic universe

06:19.340 --> 06:21.460
 of the multiverse expectations, right?

06:21.460 --> 06:24.860
 That there's probably a zillion other kinds of universes

06:24.860 --> 06:28.500
 out there if you believe in multiverse theory.

06:28.500 --> 06:32.500
 We only live in the ones where the rules are such

06:32.500 --> 06:35.900
 that lifelike hours can exist.

06:35.900 --> 06:39.220
 So using that logic, how many alien civilizations

06:39.220 --> 06:40.500
 do you think are out there?

06:40.500 --> 06:45.500
 There's like trillions of environments, aka planets,

06:48.340 --> 06:51.780
 or maybe you can think even bigger than planets.

06:51.780 --> 06:55.060
 How many lifelike organisms do you think

06:55.060 --> 06:58.500
 are out there thriving, and maybe how many

06:58.500 --> 07:01.860
 do you think are long gone, but were once here?

07:01.860 --> 07:05.700
 I think, well, innumerable, I think in terms

07:05.700 --> 07:06.900
 of the present. Greater than zero.

07:06.900 --> 07:08.380
 Much greater than zero.

07:08.380 --> 07:09.780
 I mean, I would just be surprised.

07:09.780 --> 07:12.980
 What a waste, right, of all that space just for us

07:12.980 --> 07:14.540
 if we're never gonna get there.

07:15.980 --> 07:19.780
 That would be my first way to think about it.

07:19.780 --> 07:24.780
 But second, I mean, I remember when I was about

07:25.900 --> 07:27.420
 seven or eight years old, and I would love

07:27.420 --> 07:29.420
 if any of your listeners could find

07:29.420 --> 07:31.380
 this National Geographic.

07:31.380 --> 07:35.340
 I remember opening the page of the National Geographic.

07:35.340 --> 07:37.980
 I was about, again, seven to 10 years old,

07:37.980 --> 07:42.100
 and it was sort of a current picture of the universe.

07:42.100 --> 07:45.540
 It was around probably 1968, 1969.

07:45.540 --> 07:48.340
 I just remember looking at it and thinking,

07:48.340 --> 07:53.100
 what kinds of empires have risen and fallen

07:53.100 --> 07:57.980
 across that space that we'll never know about?

07:57.980 --> 08:01.340
 And isn't that sad that we know nothing

08:01.340 --> 08:03.620
 about something so grand?

08:03.620 --> 08:08.060
 And so I've always been a reader of science fiction

08:08.060 --> 08:11.660
 because I like the creative ideas

08:11.660 --> 08:13.580
 of what people come up with.

08:13.580 --> 08:16.260
 And I especially like science fiction writers

08:16.260 --> 08:18.700
 that base it in good science,

08:18.700 --> 08:21.300
 but base it also in evolution.

08:21.300 --> 08:26.140
 That if you evolve a civilization from something

08:26.140 --> 08:29.340
 lifelike, right, some sort of biology,

08:29.340 --> 08:31.500
 its assumptions about the universe will come

08:31.500 --> 08:36.500
 from the environment in which it grew up.

08:36.540 --> 08:39.980
 So for instance, Larry Niven is a great writer,

08:39.980 --> 08:43.420
 and he imagines different kinds of civilizations.

08:43.420 --> 08:48.100
 In some cases, what happens if intelligence

08:48.100 --> 08:50.900
 evolved from a herd animal, right?

08:50.900 --> 08:53.420
 Would you lead from behind, right?

08:53.420 --> 08:56.660
 Would you be, you know, in his case,

08:56.660 --> 08:59.340
 one of them were the so called puppeteers.

08:59.340 --> 09:03.460
 And to them, the moral imperative is cowardice.

09:03.460 --> 09:07.500
 You put other people forward to run the risk for you, right?

09:07.500 --> 09:11.260
 And so he writes entire books around that premise.

09:11.260 --> 09:15.220
 There's another guy, Brin, David Brin is his name,

09:15.220 --> 09:19.820
 and he writes the so called uplift universe books.

09:19.820 --> 09:24.820
 And in those, he takes different intelligences,

09:24.820 --> 09:28.540
 each from a different evolutionary background.

09:28.540 --> 09:33.140
 And then he posits a civilization based around

09:33.140 --> 09:34.940
 where and what they came from.

09:36.020 --> 09:39.060
 And so to me, I mean, that's just fun.

09:39.060 --> 09:42.060
 But I mean, back to your original question is

09:42.060 --> 09:43.100
 how many are there?

09:43.100 --> 09:47.100
 I think as many stars as we can see.

09:47.100 --> 09:49.940
 Now, how many are currently there?

09:49.940 --> 09:53.500
 I don't know, I mean, that's the whole question of,

09:53.500 --> 09:55.780
 you know, how long can a civilization last

09:55.780 --> 09:58.740
 before it runs out of steam?

09:58.740 --> 10:02.060
 And you, for instance, does it just get bored

10:02.060 --> 10:03.900
 or does it transcend to something else?

10:03.900 --> 10:06.620
 Or does it say, I've seen enough and I'm done?

10:06.620 --> 10:08.260
 What does running out of steam look like?

10:08.260 --> 10:10.340
 It could be destroy itself or get bored.

10:10.340 --> 10:13.340
 You know, or we've done everything we can

10:13.340 --> 10:16.100
 and they just decide to stop.

10:16.100 --> 10:17.940
 I don't know, I just don't know.

10:17.940 --> 10:21.340
 It's that you all must worry that we stop reproducing

10:21.340 --> 10:23.260
 or we slow down the reproduction rate

10:23.260 --> 10:25.380
 to where the population can go to zero.

10:25.380 --> 10:27.780
 We can go to zero and we can't and we collapse.

10:27.780 --> 10:30.620
 I mean, so the only way to get around that

10:30.620 --> 10:35.500
 is perhaps create enough machines with AI

10:35.500 --> 10:36.580
 to take care of us.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.140
 What could possibly go wrong?

10:41.700 --> 10:44.940
 You've talked to people that told stories

10:44.940 --> 10:46.340
 of UFO encounters.

10:47.300 --> 10:50.060
 What is the most fascinating to you about the stories

10:50.060 --> 10:53.380
 of these UFO encounters that you've heard

10:53.380 --> 10:54.500
 that people have told you?

10:54.500 --> 10:59.500
 The similarity of them, the uniformity of the stories.

11:00.940 --> 11:02.780
 Now, I just wanna say upfront,

11:04.180 --> 11:08.580
 a lot of people think that when I speculate,

11:08.580 --> 11:11.980
 I believe something, that's not true, right?

11:11.980 --> 11:14.060
 Speculation is just creativity.

11:14.060 --> 11:16.380
 Speculation is the beginning of hypothesis.

11:17.540 --> 11:21.220
 None of what I hear in terms of the anecdotes

11:21.220 --> 11:24.380
 do I necessarily believe are they true?

11:24.380 --> 11:26.580
 But I still find them fascinating to listen to

11:26.580 --> 11:29.620
 because at some level they're still raw data

11:29.620 --> 11:30.740
 and you have to listen.

11:30.740 --> 11:35.740
 And once you start to hear the same story again and again,

11:35.820 --> 11:37.900
 then you have to say, well, there might be something to it.

11:37.900 --> 11:42.620
 I mean, maybe it's some kind of a Jungian background

11:42.620 --> 11:44.500
 in the human mind and human consciousness

11:44.500 --> 11:47.460
 that creates these stories again and again

11:47.460 --> 11:48.900
 as coming out of the DNA,

11:48.900 --> 11:51.700
 it's coming out of that pre programmed something.

11:51.700 --> 11:54.300
 And Jung talked quite a bit about this kind of thing.

11:54.300 --> 11:56.420
 The collective unconscious.

11:56.420 --> 11:58.780
 But actually one of the most interesting ones I find

11:58.780 --> 12:03.140
 is this constant message

12:03.140 --> 12:07.300
 that you're not taking care of your world.

12:07.300 --> 12:11.580
 And this came long before climate change.

12:11.580 --> 12:15.420
 It came long before many kinds of,

12:15.420 --> 12:19.660
 let's say current day memes around

12:19.660 --> 12:24.660
 taking care of our planet, pollution, et cetera.

12:25.100 --> 12:28.180
 And so, for instance, perhaps the best example of this,

12:28.180 --> 12:30.220
 the one that I find the most fascinating

12:30.220 --> 12:35.220
 is a story out of Zimbabwe, 50 or 60 children,

12:35.500 --> 12:39.660
 one afternoon in Zimbabwe.

12:39.660 --> 12:43.900
 It was a well educated group of white and black children

12:43.900 --> 12:48.900
 who had lunchtime in the playground, saw a craft

12:49.540 --> 12:50.900
 and they saw little men.

12:51.740 --> 12:53.580
 And they all ran into the teachers

12:53.580 --> 12:56.900
 and they told the same story and they drew the same pictures.

12:56.900 --> 13:00.380
 And the message several of them got was

13:00.380 --> 13:02.340
 you are not taking care of your planet.

13:03.340 --> 13:06.980
 And it got, you know, there's actually a movie coming out

13:06.980 --> 13:11.300
 on this episode and 30 years later now,

13:11.300 --> 13:13.020
 the people who were there, the children

13:13.020 --> 13:16.220
 who've now grown up say, it happened to us.

13:16.220 --> 13:18.260
 Now, did it happen?

13:18.260 --> 13:20.780
 Was it some sort of hallucination

13:20.780 --> 13:23.820
 or was it an imposed hallucination by something?

13:23.820 --> 13:24.860
 Was it material?

13:24.860 --> 13:29.860
 I don't know, but these kids were seven to 10 years old.

13:30.380 --> 13:32.620
 You see them on video.

13:32.620 --> 13:35.500
 Seven to 10 year olds can't lie like that.

13:35.500 --> 13:39.500
 And so, you know, whether it's real or not, I don't know,

13:39.500 --> 13:41.580
 but I find that fascinating data.

13:41.580 --> 13:45.780
 And again, it's these unconnected stories

13:45.780 --> 13:50.140
 of individuals with the same story.

13:50.980 --> 13:55.980
 That is worthy of further inquiry.

13:56.700 --> 14:00.700
 Yeah, so here we are humans with limited cognitive capacities

14:00.700 --> 14:02.020
 trying to make sense of the world,

14:02.020 --> 14:04.260
 trying to understand what is real and not.

14:04.260 --> 14:07.900
 We have this DNA that somehow in complex ways

14:07.900 --> 14:09.460
 is interacting with the environment.

14:09.460 --> 14:14.460
 And then we get these novel ideas

14:16.460 --> 14:19.860
 that come from the populace.

14:19.860 --> 14:24.300
 And then they make us wonder about what it all means.

14:26.060 --> 14:27.380
 And so how to interpret it.

14:27.380 --> 14:29.700
 If you think from an alien perspective,

14:29.700 --> 14:34.540
 how would you communicate with other lifelike organisms?

14:34.540 --> 14:38.780
 You perhaps have to find in points

14:38.780 --> 14:43.420
 on this interaction between the DNA and its manifestations

14:43.420 --> 14:46.300
 in terms of the human mind

14:46.300 --> 14:49.260
 and how it interacts with the environment.

14:49.260 --> 14:52.540
 So it gets some kind of, all right, what is this DNA?

14:52.540 --> 14:55.660
 What does this environment have to get in somehow

14:55.660 --> 14:59.300
 to like interact with it, to perturb the system

14:59.300 --> 15:02.660
 to where these little ants, human like ants

15:02.660 --> 15:05.660
 get like excited and figures and see stuff out.

15:05.660 --> 15:08.900
 Yeah, it has, and then somehow steer them.

15:09.740 --> 15:11.660
 First of all, for investigative purposes,

15:11.660 --> 15:14.740
 understand like oftentimes to understand a system,

15:14.740 --> 15:15.740
 you have to perturb it.

15:15.740 --> 15:16.580
 Exactly, yeah.

15:16.580 --> 15:19.420
 It's like poke at it to get excited or not.

15:19.420 --> 15:23.700
 And then the other ways you want to,

15:23.700 --> 15:25.460
 if you worry about them,

15:25.460 --> 15:28.380
 you can steer in one direction or another.

15:28.380 --> 15:31.140
 And this kind of idea that we're not taking care

15:31.140 --> 15:34.860
 of our world, that's interesting.

15:34.860 --> 15:36.660
 I mean, that's comforting, that's hopeful

15:36.660 --> 15:39.620
 because that means the greater intelligence,

15:39.620 --> 15:42.380
 which is what I would hope would want to take care of us.

15:42.380 --> 15:44.900
 Like we want to take care of the gorillas

15:44.900 --> 15:47.140
 in the national parks in Africa.

15:47.140 --> 15:49.780
 Yeah, but we don't want to take care of cockroaches.

15:49.780 --> 15:51.540
 So there's a line we draw.

15:51.540 --> 15:53.420
 So you have to hope that.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.660
 Right now we're a bunch of angry monkeys

15:55.660 --> 15:59.420
 and maybe whatever these intelligences are,

15:59.420 --> 16:00.940
 are also keeping an eye on us.

16:01.860 --> 16:03.620
 That you don't want a bunch of,

16:03.620 --> 16:06.020
 you don't want the angry monkey troop

16:06.020 --> 16:08.860
 stomping around the local galactic arm.

16:08.860 --> 16:11.740
 Do you think these folks are telling the truth?

16:11.740 --> 16:15.740
 Do you think they saw what they say they saw?

16:15.740 --> 16:19.140
 I think they saw what they said they saw,

16:19.140 --> 16:22.420
 but I also think they saw what they were shown.

16:22.420 --> 16:25.900
 I mean, if you go back to the whole notion of,

16:25.900 --> 16:28.380
 okay, how long has this been around?

16:28.380 --> 16:31.300
 It didn't just start showing up in 1947, right?

16:31.300 --> 16:36.140
 There are stories going back into the 1800s

16:36.140 --> 16:39.020
 of people who saw things in their farming,

16:39.020 --> 16:40.780
 in their farm fields in the US.

16:40.780 --> 16:45.780
 It's in local newspapers from the 1800s, it's fascinating.

16:46.340 --> 16:48.860
 But if you can go even further back,

16:48.860 --> 16:53.860
 so to your point of how would you as a higher intelligence

16:54.140 --> 16:58.340
 represent yourself to a lesser intelligence?

16:58.340 --> 17:01.980
 So let's go back to pre civilization.

17:01.980 --> 17:05.420
 Maybe you show yourself as the spirits in the forest

17:05.420 --> 17:08.340
 and you give messages through that.

17:08.340 --> 17:10.860
 Once you get a little bit more civilized,

17:10.860 --> 17:13.980
 then you show yourself as the gods and then you're God.

17:13.980 --> 17:16.140
 Well, we don't believe in God anymore necessarily,

17:16.140 --> 17:17.420
 not everybody does.

17:17.420 --> 17:18.420
 So what do we believe in?

17:18.420 --> 17:19.380
 We believe in technology.

17:19.380 --> 17:22.820
 So you show yourself as a form of technology, right?

17:22.820 --> 17:25.620
 But the common thread is you're not alone

17:25.620 --> 17:28.780
 and there's something else here with you.

17:28.780 --> 17:31.420
 And there's something that's, as you said, watching you

17:31.420 --> 17:34.700
 and at least watching over your shoulder.

17:35.780 --> 17:38.740
 But I think that like any good parent,

17:38.740 --> 17:43.740
 you don't tell your student everything, you make them learn

17:44.380 --> 17:46.300
 and learning requires mistakes

17:46.300 --> 17:50.060
 because if you tell them everything, then they get lazy.

17:50.060 --> 17:55.060
 You've looked at the brains of, or information coming

17:56.500 --> 17:58.180
 from the brain of some of the people

17:58.180 --> 17:59.860
 that have had UFO encounters.

17:59.860 --> 18:01.820
 What's common about the brain of people

18:01.820 --> 18:03.020
 who encounter UFOs?

18:04.140 --> 18:07.940
 So the study started with a group of,

18:07.940 --> 18:11.460
 let's say a cohort of individuals that were brought to me

18:11.460 --> 18:16.140
 and their MRIs to ask about the damage

18:16.140 --> 18:19.180
 that had been seen in these individuals.

18:19.180 --> 18:21.220
 It turns out that the majority of those patients

18:21.220 --> 18:24.100
 ended up being, as far as we can tell, Havana syndrome.

18:24.100 --> 18:28.940
 And so for me at least, that part of the story ends

18:28.940 --> 18:30.180
 in terms of the injury,

18:30.180 --> 18:33.260
 it's likely almost all Havana syndrome.

18:33.260 --> 18:36.580
 That's somebody else's problem now, that's not my problem.

18:38.740 --> 18:41.900
 But when we were looking at the brains of these individuals,

18:41.900 --> 18:44.140
 we noticed something right in the center

18:44.140 --> 18:47.580
 of the basal ganglia in many of these individuals

18:47.580 --> 18:49.300
 that at first we thought was damage.

18:49.300 --> 18:54.300
 It was basically an enriched patch of MRI dense neurons

18:56.060 --> 18:57.540
 that we thought was damage,

18:57.540 --> 18:59.140
 but then it was showing up in everybody.

18:59.140 --> 19:01.580
 And then we looked and we said, oh, it's actually not.

19:01.580 --> 19:04.060
 The other readings on these MRIs showed

19:04.060 --> 19:05.780
 that actually that's living tissue.

19:06.820 --> 19:10.100
 That's actually the head of the caudate in the pitamen.

19:10.100 --> 19:12.100
 And at the time, and I remember even asking

19:12.100 --> 19:16.660
 a good friend of mine at Stanford, who was a psychiatrist,

19:16.660 --> 19:18.380
 what does the basal ganglia do?

19:18.380 --> 19:21.740
 He said, oh, the basal ganglia is just about movement

19:21.740 --> 19:24.380
 and nerve and motor control.

19:24.380 --> 19:27.900
 I said, well, that's odd because these other papers

19:27.900 --> 19:30.140
 that we were reading at the time started to suggest

19:30.140 --> 19:34.580
 that it was involved with higher intelligence

19:34.580 --> 19:37.340
 and is actually downstream of the executive function

19:38.340 --> 19:42.780
 and involved with intuition and planning.

19:42.780 --> 19:44.380
 And then if you think about it,

19:44.380 --> 19:46.700
 if you're gonna have motor control,

19:46.700 --> 19:48.820
 which is centralized in one place,

19:48.820 --> 19:52.180
 motor control requires knowledge of the environment.

19:52.180 --> 19:55.820
 You don't wanna move something and hit the table.

19:55.820 --> 19:57.620
 Or if you're walking across a room,

19:57.620 --> 20:01.660
 you want to be aware and cognizant

20:01.660 --> 20:03.660
 of what you might bump into.

20:03.660 --> 20:06.900
 So obviously all of that planning

20:08.940 --> 20:11.380
 requires access to all the senses.

20:11.380 --> 20:14.460
 It requires access to your desires, memory,

20:14.460 --> 20:16.380
 knowledge of where and what you want

20:16.380 --> 20:18.540
 and desire to walk nearby.

20:18.540 --> 20:20.780
 Like I used the example of if you're at a party,

20:20.780 --> 20:22.940
 you wanna avoid that person, you like that person,

20:22.940 --> 20:25.220
 the waiter is about to drop something.

20:25.220 --> 20:28.500
 All without thinking, you maneuver.

20:28.500 --> 20:31.020
 So that actually, all that planning is done

20:31.020 --> 20:32.300
 in the basal ganglia.

20:33.580 --> 20:36.620
 And it's actually now called the brain within the brain.

20:36.620 --> 20:40.540
 It's a goal processing system.

20:40.540 --> 20:43.380
 Subservient to executive function.

20:43.380 --> 20:48.380
 So what we think we found there was not something

20:48.460 --> 20:50.380
 which allows people to talk to UFOs.

20:50.380 --> 20:55.380
 I mean, I think the UFO community took it a step too far.

20:55.420 --> 21:00.020
 What I think we found was a form of higher

21:00.020 --> 21:01.980
 functioning and processing.

21:01.980 --> 21:03.620
 So what we then looked at,

21:03.620 --> 21:05.700
 and this was the most fascinating part of it,

21:05.700 --> 21:09.580
 we looked then at individuals in the families

21:09.580 --> 21:14.220
 or those, let's say the index case individuals.

21:14.220 --> 21:16.620
 And we found that it was actually in families.

21:16.620 --> 21:20.140
 And more so, this is the most fascinating part.

21:20.140 --> 21:24.260
 We've probably looked now at about 200 just random cases

21:24.260 --> 21:27.540
 that you can download off of databases online.

21:27.540 --> 21:31.020
 You don't see this higher connectivity.

21:31.020 --> 21:34.580
 You only find it in what Kit Green would have called

21:34.580 --> 21:37.100
 or has called higher functioning individuals.

21:37.100 --> 21:42.100
 People who are, I mean, he called them savants.

21:42.980 --> 21:47.100
 I don't have the means to, we haven't done the testing.

21:47.100 --> 21:49.980
 But it turns out my family has it, right?

21:49.980 --> 21:54.980
 We found it in me, my brother, my sister, my mother.

21:55.100 --> 21:57.900
 We found it as well in other individuals,

21:57.900 --> 21:59.980
 husband and wife pairs.

21:59.980 --> 22:03.580
 So statistically, if you had a group of 20 individuals

22:03.580 --> 22:06.260
 and you found two husband wife pairs, both of whom had it,

22:06.260 --> 22:08.740
 and yet it's only found at about, we think,

22:08.740 --> 22:11.020
 one in 200, one in 300 individuals.

22:11.020 --> 22:13.140
 The fact that two individuals came together,

22:14.220 --> 22:15.820
 two sets of individuals came together,

22:15.820 --> 22:18.900
 both of whom had it, implied either

22:18.900 --> 22:23.900
 a restricted breeding group or attraction.

22:25.460 --> 22:29.620
 The reason why it seems to be in, let's say,

22:29.620 --> 22:33.180
 so called experiencers or people who claim,

22:33.180 --> 22:36.020
 if intuition is the ability to see something

22:36.020 --> 22:36.860
 that other people don't,

22:36.860 --> 22:40.260
 and I don't mean that in a paranormal sense,

22:40.260 --> 22:42.700
 but being able to see something just in front of you

22:42.700 --> 22:44.540
 that other people might just dismiss,

22:45.540 --> 22:48.220
 well, maybe that's a function of a higher kind

22:48.220 --> 22:53.220
 of intelligence to say, well, I'm not looking at an artifact.

22:55.180 --> 22:58.020
 I'm not looking at something that I should just ignore.

22:58.020 --> 23:00.420
 I'm seeing something and I recognize it for,

23:00.420 --> 23:02.620
 not what it is, but that it is something

23:02.620 --> 23:05.620
 different than what is normally found in my environment.

23:06.660 --> 23:08.820
 Yeah, you know, I have a little bit of that.

23:09.700 --> 23:13.700
 I seem to see the magic in a lot of moments.

23:13.700 --> 23:16.540
 I have a deep, it's obviously, not obviously,

23:16.540 --> 23:19.860
 but it seems to be chemical in nature

23:19.860 --> 23:23.460
 that I just am excited about life.

23:23.460 --> 23:25.220
 I love life.

23:25.220 --> 23:26.620
 I love stupid things.

23:26.620 --> 23:28.380
 It feels like I'm high a lot,

23:28.380 --> 23:30.860
 on mushrooms or something like that,

23:30.860 --> 23:32.660
 where you'd really appreciate that.

23:32.660 --> 23:37.100
 So I'm able to detect something about the environment

23:38.140 --> 23:40.460
 that maybe others don't, I don't know,

23:40.460 --> 23:45.460
 but I seem to be over the top grateful to be alive

23:45.460 --> 23:49.540
 for a lot of stupid reasons, and that's in there somewhere.

23:49.540 --> 23:50.980
 I mean, it's kind of interesting

23:50.980 --> 23:55.980
 because it really is true that our brains,

23:56.620 --> 23:59.820
 the way we're brought up, but also the genetics

23:59.820 --> 24:03.780
 enables us to see certain slices of the world,

24:03.780 --> 24:08.780
 and some people are probably more receptive

24:08.940 --> 24:12.420
 to anomalous information.

24:12.420 --> 24:17.420
 They see the magic, the possibility in the novel thing

24:18.700 --> 24:21.980
 as opposed to kind of finding the pattern

24:21.980 --> 24:24.340
 of the common, of the regular.

24:24.340 --> 24:27.380
 Some people are more, wait a minute, this is kind of weird.

24:27.380 --> 24:28.740
 I mean, a lot of those people would probably

24:28.740 --> 24:30.020
 become scientists too.

24:30.020 --> 24:34.300
 Like, huh, there's this pattern happening

24:34.300 --> 24:36.060
 over and over and over, and then something weird

24:36.060 --> 24:41.020
 just happened, and then you get excited by that weirdness

24:41.020 --> 24:44.260
 and start to pull the string and discover

24:44.260 --> 24:46.220
 what is at the core of that weirdness.

24:46.220 --> 24:51.220
 Perhaps, is that, maybe by way of question,

24:53.060 --> 24:55.420
 how does the human perception system deal

24:55.420 --> 24:57.740
 with anomalous information, do you think?

24:57.740 --> 24:59.300
 Well, it first tries to classify it

24:59.300 --> 25:00.940
 and get it out of the way.

25:00.940 --> 25:04.340
 If it's not food, if it's not sex, right?

25:04.340 --> 25:08.380
 If it's not in the way of my desires,

25:08.380 --> 25:10.700
 or if it is in the way of my desires,

25:10.700 --> 25:13.660
 then you focus on it.

25:13.660 --> 25:16.820
 And so I think the question is

25:16.820 --> 25:19.260
 how much spare processing power,

25:19.260 --> 25:22.620
 how much CPU cycles do we spend

25:22.620 --> 25:27.620
 on things that are not those core desires?

25:28.260 --> 25:33.260
 What is the most kind of memorable, powerful

25:35.180 --> 25:38.660
 UFO encounter report you ever heard?

25:38.660 --> 25:40.460
 Just to you, on a personal level,

25:40.460 --> 25:42.820
 like something that was really powerful.

25:42.820 --> 25:45.060
 Well, I mentioned the Zimbabwe one.

25:45.060 --> 25:47.380
 That's particularly interesting.

25:47.380 --> 25:50.620
 And one that actually most people don't know about,

25:50.620 --> 25:54.860
 but family driving down the highway,

25:54.860 --> 25:59.860
 two little girls in the back, open glass topped car,

26:00.740 --> 26:05.740
 and the little girls see a craft right over their car.

26:06.380 --> 26:08.980
 This is in the middle of the day on a busy highway.

26:10.140 --> 26:11.100
 The mother sees it.

26:12.580 --> 26:16.380
 Nobody can, they look around, nobody else seems to see it.

26:16.380 --> 26:19.900
 So the girls take out their camera, take a picture of it,

26:19.900 --> 26:21.060
 and then they get home.

26:22.140 --> 26:24.500
 They look at the picture.

26:24.500 --> 26:28.220
 There's no craft, but there's a little object

26:28.220 --> 26:31.980
 about 30 feet above their car or so,

26:31.980 --> 26:36.340
 probably about three feet across, kind of star shaped.

26:36.340 --> 26:39.300
 It's not the craft, but it's something else.

26:39.300 --> 26:41.300
 Obviously there was something there.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.780
 And so what were they seeing?

26:42.780 --> 26:44.060
 Were they seeing a projection?

26:44.060 --> 26:46.900
 Were they seeing, and why were only they seeing it?

26:46.900 --> 26:51.900
 And the photograph was capturing something very different

26:52.460 --> 26:55.460
 than what we're seeing, but they're still an object.

26:55.460 --> 26:58.220
 Can you give a little bit of context?

26:58.220 --> 26:59.700
 Is this from modern day?

26:59.700 --> 27:00.540
 It's modern day.

27:00.540 --> 27:01.380
 Oh yeah, they had a camera.

27:01.380 --> 27:02.460
 I mean, they had a cell phone camera.

27:02.460 --> 27:06.020
 And this is like a report provided.

27:06.020 --> 27:08.540
 By the way, where is a central place to provide a report?

27:08.540 --> 27:09.380
 Is this?

27:09.380 --> 27:11.020
 Oh, there's a move on, but this isn't public.

27:11.020 --> 27:12.660
 I've seen the picture.

27:12.660 --> 27:14.540
 Oh, this is something you've directly interacted with.

27:14.540 --> 27:16.780
 Yeah, yeah, I've seen the picture.

27:16.780 --> 27:21.780
 So those moments like that, they captivate your mind.

27:23.220 --> 27:24.060
 It's so different,

27:24.060 --> 27:26.900
 and it doesn't fall into the standard story at all.

27:26.900 --> 27:31.060
 But it also, but in another way, it's kind of a,

27:31.060 --> 27:33.780
 it's a clear enunciation of this notion

27:33.780 --> 27:36.300
 that when people see events,

27:36.300 --> 27:37.900
 they don't all see the same thing.

27:37.900 --> 27:40.380
 Now, we've heard this about traffic accidents.

27:40.380 --> 27:42.860
 Different people will see the color of the car differently

27:42.860 --> 27:44.500
 or the chain of events differently.

27:44.500 --> 27:47.100
 And this tells you that memory isn't anywhere near

27:47.100 --> 27:48.740
 what we think it is.

27:48.740 --> 27:52.380
 But the issue around these so called UFO reports

27:52.380 --> 27:56.420
 is that the same people will see a very different thing,

27:56.420 --> 28:01.420
 almost as if whatever it is is projecting a,

28:01.660 --> 28:04.260
 is projecting something into the mind

28:04.260 --> 28:06.980
 rather than it being real, right?

28:06.980 --> 28:09.820
 Rather than it being a real manifestation,

28:09.820 --> 28:11.460
 material in front of you,

28:11.460 --> 28:16.340
 it's actually almost some sort of an altered virtual reality

28:16.340 --> 28:18.020
 that is imposed on you.

28:18.020 --> 28:21.860
 I mean, I think the company Meta

28:21.860 --> 28:23.820
 and all the virtual reality companies

28:23.820 --> 28:26.500
 would love to have something like that, right?

28:26.500 --> 28:27.820
 Where you don't have to actually wear something

28:27.820 --> 28:31.500
 on your face to experience a virtual reality.

28:31.500 --> 28:33.900
 What happens if you could just project it?

28:33.900 --> 28:35.180
 Well, that's the fundamental question

28:35.180 --> 28:37.140
 from an alien perspective.

28:37.140 --> 28:40.180
 When you look at it, or as we humans look at ants,

28:40.180 --> 28:43.340
 how does its perception system operate?

28:43.340 --> 28:45.700
 So not only how does this thing's mind operate,

28:45.700 --> 28:47.740
 how does the human mind operate,

28:47.740 --> 28:50.580
 but how does their perception system operate

28:50.580 --> 28:55.500
 so that we can stimulate the perception system properly

28:55.500 --> 28:57.460
 to get them to think certain things.

28:57.460 --> 29:02.460
 And so, that's a really important question.

29:02.540 --> 29:06.940
 Humans think that the only way to communicate

29:06.940 --> 29:11.940
 is in 3D or 4D space time, there's physical objects,

29:12.140 --> 29:15.300
 or maybe you write things into some kind of language.

29:15.300 --> 29:20.300
 But there could be just so much more richness

29:22.340 --> 29:23.700
 in how you can communicate.

29:23.700 --> 29:25.300
 And so, from an alien perspective,

29:25.300 --> 29:28.020
 where somebody has much greater technological capabilities,

29:28.020 --> 29:31.540
 you have to figure out how do I use the skills I have

29:31.540 --> 29:35.500
 to stimulate the limited humans.

29:35.500 --> 29:37.940
 Right, well, I mean, let's take the ants exam

29:37.940 --> 29:38.940
 again as an example.

29:38.940 --> 29:43.220
 Let's say that you wanted to make ants practical.

29:43.220 --> 29:45.260
 You wanted to use them for something, right?

29:45.260 --> 29:47.580
 You wanted to use them as a form of biological robot.

29:47.580 --> 29:50.900
 Now, DARPA and other people have been trying

29:50.900 --> 29:55.900
 to use insects for, turn them into biological robots.

29:56.060 --> 29:58.700
 But if you wanted to, you would have to interact

29:58.700 --> 30:02.180
 with their sense of smell, right?

30:02.180 --> 30:05.540
 Their pheromone system that they use to interact

30:05.540 --> 30:06.620
 with each other.

30:06.620 --> 30:10.580
 So you would either create those molecules

30:10.580 --> 30:12.020
 to talk to them, to make them do,

30:12.020 --> 30:13.700
 I'm not saying talk to them as if they're intelligent,

30:13.700 --> 30:16.860
 but talk to them to manipulate them in ways that you want.

30:16.860 --> 30:19.420
 Or if you were advanced enough,

30:19.420 --> 30:24.420
 you would use some sort of electromagnetic or other means

30:24.460 --> 30:26.820
 to stimulate their neurons in ways

30:26.820 --> 30:30.380
 that would accomplish the same goal as the pheromones,

30:30.380 --> 30:33.300
 but by doing it in a sort of a telefactoring way.

30:34.180 --> 30:37.900
 So let's say you wanted to telefactor with humans.

30:37.900 --> 30:40.860
 You would interact with them.

30:40.860 --> 30:42.580
 And this is, again, this is a technology

30:42.580 --> 30:45.380
 which you could imagine possible.

30:45.380 --> 30:47.380
 You could telefactor information

30:47.380 --> 30:50.540
 into the sensory system of a human, right?

30:50.540 --> 30:53.220
 But then each human is a little bit different.

30:53.220 --> 30:56.020
 So either you know enough about them to tailor it

30:56.020 --> 30:58.780
 to that individual, or you just basically take advantage

30:58.780 --> 31:02.180
 of whatever the sensory net is that that individual has.

31:02.180 --> 31:05.300
 So if you happen to be good at sound,

31:05.300 --> 31:08.260
 or you happen to be a very visually inclined individual,

31:08.260 --> 31:11.260
 then maybe the sensory information that you get

31:11.260 --> 31:15.140
 that's most effective in terms of transmitting information

31:15.140 --> 31:17.180
 would come through that portal.

31:17.180 --> 31:19.780
 I think the aliens would need to figure out

31:19.780 --> 31:22.700
 that humans value physical consistency.

31:22.700 --> 31:25.140
 So we've discovered physics.

31:25.140 --> 31:28.420
 So we want our perception to make sense.

31:28.420 --> 31:30.580
 Maybe they don't, you know,

31:30.580 --> 31:32.900
 that's not an obvious fact of perception,

31:32.900 --> 31:37.140
 that you have to figure out what kind of things

31:37.140 --> 31:39.140
 are humans used to observing

31:39.140 --> 31:41.500
 in this particular environment of Earth,

31:41.500 --> 31:44.860
 and how do we stimulate the perception system

31:44.860 --> 31:47.980
 in a way that's not anomalous,

31:47.980 --> 31:50.620
 or not too, it doesn't cross that threshold

31:50.620 --> 31:53.540
 of just like, well, that's way too weird.

31:53.540 --> 31:56.040
 So they have to, I mean, that's not obvious

31:56.040 --> 31:58.420
 that that should be important.

31:58.420 --> 32:02.380
 Maybe you wanna err on the side of anomaly,

32:02.380 --> 32:04.020
 like lean into the weirdness.

32:04.020 --> 32:06.780
 So communication is complicated.

32:06.780 --> 32:09.620
 Well, that's why I always find this issue

32:09.620 --> 32:13.820
 of people talking about the so called grays as interesting,

32:13.820 --> 32:17.300
 because it is related to what you're saying.

32:17.300 --> 32:19.460
 They're different enough,

32:19.460 --> 32:22.380
 but they're not so different as to be scary, right?

32:22.380 --> 32:25.540
 They're not venom dripping fangs, right?

32:25.540 --> 32:27.860
 They're different enough,

32:27.860 --> 32:32.220
 but it's also like they're what you could imagine

32:32.220 --> 32:34.060
 us becoming in some distant future.

32:34.060 --> 32:36.820
 So is that a purposeful representation?

32:37.920 --> 32:38.760
 I don't know.

32:38.760 --> 32:41.260
 I mean, I don't believe in the grays, for instance,

32:41.260 --> 32:44.580
 but I believe that people think that they see it.

32:44.580 --> 32:47.160
 So if we're talking about a communication strategy

32:47.160 --> 32:50.320
 that says, you know, we're like you,

32:50.320 --> 32:53.320
 but not the same as you,

32:53.320 --> 32:57.660
 this might be a manifestation that you represent

32:57.660 --> 32:59.720
 in terms of a communication strategy.

33:00.660 --> 33:04.060
 What do you make of David's favorite sighting

33:04.060 --> 33:06.300
 of the Tic Tac UFO,

33:06.300 --> 33:09.540
 and other pilots who have seen these objects

33:09.540 --> 33:11.500
 that seem to defy the laws of physics?

33:12.540 --> 33:15.720
 Well, I think you have to take them at their word.

33:17.060 --> 33:18.140
 Are they fascinating to you?

33:18.140 --> 33:18.980
 Oh, absolutely.

33:18.980 --> 33:20.940
 No, I know a lot of these people, right?

33:20.940 --> 33:24.620
 So I know Lou Elizondo, Chris Mellon,

33:24.620 --> 33:26.340
 the whole crowd I've been,

33:26.340 --> 33:30.500
 I saw the videos about three weeks or so

33:30.500 --> 33:33.340
 before they went public.

33:33.340 --> 33:38.220
 I was at a bar with Lou overlooking the Pentagon

33:38.220 --> 33:40.160
 in Crystal City, and they showed them to me,

33:40.160 --> 33:42.020
 and my hair stood on end.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.360
 And he said, this is coming out soon.

33:45.360 --> 33:49.340
 And I know one of the guys on the inside

33:49.340 --> 33:51.380
 who was the Naval Intelligence

33:51.380 --> 33:53.860
 who had interviewed all of these pilots again

33:53.860 --> 33:55.540
 before this came out.

33:55.540 --> 33:58.780
 And it was hair raising to hear this,

33:58.780 --> 34:03.780
 but also exciting that here's not just people's testimony,

34:04.460 --> 34:05.860
 these are credible individuals.

34:05.860 --> 34:08.300
 And if you've seen the 60 minute episode

34:08.300 --> 34:10.360
 with some of the pilots,

34:11.620 --> 34:13.180
 they have no monetary gain.

34:13.180 --> 34:16.960
 If anything, they've got negative gain from coming out.

34:16.960 --> 34:19.700
 But then you also have all of those simultaneous

34:21.060 --> 34:23.820
 ship analysis from the USS Princeton

34:23.820 --> 34:26.260
 and the radar analysis, et cetera.

34:26.260 --> 34:31.260
 So at the end of the day, it's just data.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.820
 It's not a conclusion.

34:35.300 --> 34:38.660
 I'd be perfectly happy, honestly, perfectly happy

34:38.660 --> 34:41.300
 if somebody showed that it was all a hoax.

34:41.300 --> 34:44.140
 I can go back to my day job, right?

34:44.140 --> 34:47.820
 That could be a hoax, but other things might not be.

34:47.820 --> 34:49.620
 This is the point.

34:49.620 --> 34:53.060
 This is why it's nice to remove some of the stigma

34:53.060 --> 34:55.540
 about this topic because it's all just data

34:55.540 --> 35:00.540
 and anomalous events are such that they're going to be rare

35:03.660 --> 35:05.860
 in terms of how much data they represent.

35:05.860 --> 35:08.380
 But we have to consider the full range of data

35:08.380 --> 35:11.540
 to discover the things that actually represent something

35:11.540 --> 35:14.740
 that's, if we pull at it, we'll discover something

35:14.740 --> 35:18.100
 that's extraterrestrial or something deep

35:18.100 --> 35:21.980
 about the phenomena on Earth that we don't yet understand.

35:21.980 --> 35:22.820
 Right.

35:22.820 --> 35:26.400
 Well, if it only stimulates people, for instance,

35:26.400 --> 35:29.380
 to think, okay, well, what happens if we could move

35:29.380 --> 35:32.240
 like that with momentumless movement?

35:32.240 --> 35:37.240
 And it stimulates young individuals to go into the sciences

35:38.540 --> 35:40.940
 to ask those questions.

35:40.940 --> 35:41.980
 That to me is fascinating.

35:41.980 --> 35:44.580
 I mean, after I've been openly talking about this

35:44.580 --> 35:47.420
 in the last year, especially, I've had a number

35:47.420 --> 35:52.420
 of students from top schools who aren't my students

35:52.500 --> 35:57.300
 come to me and say, if I can help, let me.

35:57.300 --> 35:58.180
 How can I help?

35:58.180 --> 35:59.620
 I never had thought about this before,

35:59.620 --> 36:02.940
 but you opened, you and others, not just you and others,

36:02.940 --> 36:06.260
 have opened my mind to thinking about this matter.

36:06.260 --> 36:07.620
 Yeah, that's why it's actually funny

36:07.620 --> 36:11.720
 that Elon Musk doesn't think too much about this,

36:13.380 --> 36:15.540
 these kinds of propulsion systems that could defy

36:15.540 --> 36:18.700
 the laws of physics as we currently understand them.

36:18.700 --> 36:22.720
 To me, it's a powerful way to think what is possible.

36:23.660 --> 36:26.660
 It's inspiring, even if some of the data

36:26.660 --> 36:30.260
 doesn't represent extraterrestrial vehicles.

36:30.260 --> 36:32.940
 I think the observation itself,

36:32.940 --> 36:35.020
 it's like something you mentioned,

36:35.020 --> 36:40.020
 which is hypothesizing, imagining these things,

36:40.540 --> 36:43.360
 considering the possibility of these things,

36:43.360 --> 36:45.780
 I think opens up your mind in a way

36:45.780 --> 36:49.420
 that ultimately can create the technology.

36:49.420 --> 36:52.140
 First, you have to believe the technology is possible

36:52.140 --> 36:54.060
 before you can create it.

36:54.060 --> 36:58.020
 In my own lab, we always look for,

36:58.020 --> 37:00.880
 as I've said before, what is inevitable,

37:00.880 --> 37:05.220
 and saying inevitably this is the kind of data we need,

37:05.220 --> 37:06.540
 but if we need that kind of data,

37:06.540 --> 37:10.780
 the instrument we want doesn't exist.

37:10.780 --> 37:14.980
 Okay, so I imagine the perfect instrument, I can't make it,

37:14.980 --> 37:18.300
 and you back into something which is practical,

37:18.300 --> 37:22.500
 and then you, in a sense, reverse engineer the future

37:22.500 --> 37:24.580
 of what it is that you wanna make.

37:24.580 --> 37:28.540
 And I've started and sold at least half a dozen

37:28.540 --> 37:32.420
 or more companies using that basic premise.

37:32.420 --> 37:35.940
 And so it was always something that didn't exist today,

37:35.940 --> 37:38.740
 but we imagined what we wanted.

37:38.740 --> 37:41.980
 And at the time, many people said it couldn't be done.

37:41.980 --> 37:43.720
 I mean, for instance, all the gene therapy

37:43.720 --> 37:46.200
 that's done today with retroviruses

37:46.200 --> 37:49.980
 came from a group meeting in David Baltimore's lab.

37:49.980 --> 37:54.860
 I was a postdoc with him, and one of the other postdocs

37:54.860 --> 37:58.060
 wasn't able to make retroviruses in a way

37:58.060 --> 38:00.700
 that he wanted to, and I realized I had a cell line

38:00.700 --> 38:02.820
 that would allow us to make retroviruses

38:02.820 --> 38:04.780
 in two days rather than two months.

38:05.620 --> 38:09.600
 And so he and I then worked together to make that system,

38:09.600 --> 38:11.580
 and now all gene therapy with retroviruses

38:11.580 --> 38:14.700
 is done using this basic approach around the whole world,

38:14.700 --> 38:17.300
 because something couldn't be done,

38:17.300 --> 38:22.100
 and we wanted to do it better, and we imagined the future.

38:22.100 --> 38:27.100
 And so that's, I think, what the whole UFO phenomenon

38:27.100 --> 38:28.100
 is doing for people.

38:28.100 --> 38:29.900
 It's like, well, let's imagine a future

38:30.940 --> 38:33.060
 where these kinds of technologies are,

38:33.060 --> 38:34.260
 but also let's imagine a future

38:34.260 --> 38:36.140
 where we don't blow ourselves up, right?

38:36.140 --> 38:37.580
 So if these things are there,

38:37.580 --> 38:39.480
 they manage to not blow themselves up.

38:40.420 --> 38:44.740
 So it means that at least one other civilization

38:44.740 --> 38:47.160
 got past the inflection point.

38:47.160 --> 38:50.220
 So if some of the encounters are actually representing

38:50.220 --> 38:52.560
 alien civilizations visiting us,

38:52.560 --> 38:57.400
 why do you think they're doing so?

38:57.400 --> 39:00.100
 You suggested that perhaps it's the study

39:00.100 --> 39:02.900
 understand their own past, right?

39:02.900 --> 39:05.340
 What are some of the motivations, do you think?

39:05.340 --> 39:09.240
 And again, from our perspective, us as humans,

39:09.240 --> 39:11.060
 what motivations would we have

39:11.060 --> 39:12.960
 when we approach other civilizations

39:12.960 --> 39:15.140
 we might discover in the future?

39:15.140 --> 39:17.620
 Well, I think one motivation might be

39:17.620 --> 39:22.340
 to steer us away from the precipice, right?

39:22.340 --> 39:24.480
 Or on the assumption that,

39:25.420 --> 39:27.580
 even if we make it past the precipice,

39:27.580 --> 39:32.540
 at least we're not a bunch of psychopaths running around.

39:32.540 --> 39:35.300
 So maybe there's a little bit of motivation there

39:35.300 --> 39:38.140
 to make sure that the neighbor that's growing up next to you

39:38.140 --> 39:40.520
 is not unruly.

39:42.900 --> 39:46.460
 But I mean, maybe it's sort of a moral imperative,

39:46.460 --> 39:52.900
 like what we have with creating national parks

39:52.900 --> 39:56.620
 where animals can continue to live out their lives

39:56.620 --> 39:57.780
 in a natural way.

39:58.980 --> 39:59.900
 I don't know.

39:59.900 --> 40:02.420
 I mean, that would be, I mean, the problem is

40:02.420 --> 40:07.420
 we're imagining from a anthropomorphic viewpoint

40:08.540 --> 40:10.260
 what an alien might think.

40:10.260 --> 40:14.740
 And as I've said before, alien means alien, right?

40:14.740 --> 40:17.580
 I mean, not Hollywood aliens,

40:17.580 --> 40:21.300
 but a whole different way of thinking

40:21.300 --> 40:23.620
 and a whole different level of experience

40:23.620 --> 40:25.960
 and let's say wisdom, hopefully,

40:27.020 --> 40:30.220
 that we could only hope to understand.

40:30.220 --> 40:32.220
 Now, but if we ever get out there,

40:32.220 --> 40:36.160
 if we ever make it past our current problems,

40:37.100 --> 40:39.060
 and even if we don't have faster than light travel,

40:39.060 --> 40:43.020
 and even if we're only using ram scoops

40:43.020 --> 40:46.820
 or light sails to get where we wanna go,

40:46.820 --> 40:50.620
 and it takes us 10,000 years to get somewhere

40:50.620 --> 40:53.980
 or to spread out, we might encounter such things.

40:53.980 --> 40:56.360
 And are we just gonna stomp all over it

40:56.360 --> 41:00.500
 like we did in colonial South America or Africa

41:00.500 --> 41:03.580
 or all the rest on our current path, likely?

41:04.860 --> 41:06.580
 And so what are we gonna learn?

41:06.580 --> 41:08.500
 Well, we're getting better and better

41:08.500 --> 41:10.580
 at understanding what is life.

41:10.580 --> 41:13.820
 And I think we're getting better and better

41:13.820 --> 41:17.460
 at being careful, not to step on it when we see it.

41:17.460 --> 41:19.740
 And this is one of the nice things

41:19.740 --> 41:24.420
 about talking about UFOs is it expands the Overton window.

41:24.420 --> 41:28.500
 It expands our understanding of what possibly could be life.

41:28.500 --> 41:29.740
 It gets us to think.

41:29.740 --> 41:32.060
 It gets the scientific community to think.

41:32.060 --> 41:34.860
 When we go to Mars, when we go to these different moons

41:34.860 --> 41:36.260
 that possibly have life,

41:37.140 --> 41:40.280
 we're not looking at legged organisms.

41:40.280 --> 41:44.140
 We're looking at some kind of complexity

41:45.340 --> 41:50.340
 that arises in resistance to the natural world.

41:51.860 --> 41:54.100
 And there's a lot of interesting.

41:54.100 --> 41:57.300
 I like that, resistance to the natural world, yeah.

41:57.300 --> 42:01.020
 So somehow there's a rebellious process,

42:01.020 --> 42:03.380
 complex system going on here.

42:03.380 --> 42:06.820
 And I don't know the many ways it could take form.

42:06.820 --> 42:11.820
 There's a sense for aliens that as the technology develops,

42:12.780 --> 42:16.820
 they take form more and more as information,

42:16.820 --> 42:21.420
 as something that can influence the space of ideas,

42:21.420 --> 42:24.840
 of the processing of data itself.

42:24.840 --> 42:29.360
 So I just, this idea of embodiment that we humans so admire,

42:30.180 --> 42:34.380
 physically visible, perceivable embodiment

42:34.380 --> 42:39.380
 may be a very inefficient thing, right?

42:39.700 --> 42:43.660
 If you think just about your area, AI,

42:43.660 --> 42:48.020
 we're trying to make smaller and smaller and smaller

42:49.140 --> 42:54.140
 circuitry that is basically closer and closer

42:55.780 --> 43:00.440
 to the physics of how the universe operates, right?

43:00.440 --> 43:02.700
 Right down at the level of, I mean, quantum computers

43:02.700 --> 43:05.800
 are basically right down about quantum information storage.

43:05.800 --> 43:10.540
 So fast forward 10,000, 100,000 years,

43:10.540 --> 43:13.540
 maybe somebody found a way to embody AI directly

43:13.540 --> 43:16.420
 into the physics of the universe, right?

43:16.420 --> 43:19.620
 And it doesn't require a physical manifestation.

43:19.620 --> 43:22.820
 It just sits in space time.

43:22.820 --> 43:25.260
 It's just a locally ordered space.

43:25.260 --> 43:28.780
 We're just locally ordered space time, right?

43:28.780 --> 43:31.140
 You know, I mean, but maybe they just,

43:31.140 --> 43:33.820
 they found a way to embody it there.

43:33.820 --> 43:35.380
 They probably have to get really good

43:35.380 --> 43:38.860
 at not, you know, trampling on the ants.

43:38.860 --> 43:40.360
 The better your technology gets,

43:40.360 --> 43:42.860
 the easier it is to accidentally like, oops,

43:44.340 --> 43:48.000
 just destroy these simpleton biological systems.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.600
 We constantly think about whatever these things might be.

43:50.600 --> 43:55.600
 We think that they are some sort of a unified force.

43:56.140 --> 43:58.840
 Well, maybe they're not unified.

43:58.840 --> 44:03.020
 Maybe they are as disparate as you and I are.

44:03.020 --> 44:06.620
 And maybe what keeps them from stomping all over the ants

44:06.620 --> 44:09.140
 is each other, right?

44:09.140 --> 44:11.620
 That they are in a self tension

44:11.620 --> 44:16.620
 to prevent one or more of them from running amok.

44:17.940 --> 44:18.780
 Oh, yeah.

44:18.780 --> 44:21.020
 I mean, that's kind of the anarchy of nations

44:21.020 --> 44:21.840
 that we have on earth.

44:21.840 --> 44:26.840
 So there's always going to be this.

44:27.320 --> 44:28.160
 There's a hierarchy.

44:28.160 --> 44:29.620
 This hierarchy that's formed

44:29.620 --> 44:31.700
 of greater and greater intelligences.

44:31.700 --> 44:34.500
 And they're all probably also wondering,

44:34.500 --> 44:36.100
 wait, what's bigger than me?

44:36.100 --> 44:36.940
 Exactly.

44:36.940 --> 44:39.340
 That's what I always wonder is that maybe that they're,

44:39.340 --> 44:43.740
 what keeps them in line is something that is beyond them.

44:43.740 --> 44:45.240
 Like what created the universe.

44:45.240 --> 44:48.560
 I mean, that's probably a question that bothers them too.

44:50.360 --> 44:53.000
 What about the communication task itself?

44:53.000 --> 44:54.780
 How hard do you think it is for aliens

44:54.780 --> 44:56.280
 to communicate with humans?

44:56.280 --> 45:00.340
 So is this something you think about

45:00.340 --> 45:02.060
 about this barrier of communication

45:02.060 --> 45:04.980
 between biological systems and something else?

45:04.980 --> 45:07.620
 How difficult is it to find a common language?

45:08.660 --> 45:11.220
 Well, I think if you're smart enough

45:11.220 --> 45:13.780
 or technologically enabled enough,

45:13.780 --> 45:16.660
 it's relatively straightforward.

45:18.420 --> 45:21.740
 Now, whether your concepts

45:21.740 --> 45:26.740
 can ever be dumbed down to us,

45:27.240 --> 45:28.880
 that might be hard.

45:30.120 --> 45:30.960
 I mean.

45:30.960 --> 45:32.280
 Again, talking to the ants.

45:32.280 --> 45:33.260
 Talking to the ants.

45:33.260 --> 45:34.100
 I mean, they don't.

45:34.100 --> 45:35.240
 On Instagram.

45:35.240 --> 45:36.080
 So.

45:38.320 --> 45:39.800
 You want to look good in this picture.

45:39.800 --> 45:40.640
 Let me explain to you.

45:40.640 --> 45:41.960
 Let me explain to you why.

45:41.960 --> 45:42.800
 Yeah.

45:44.200 --> 45:46.920
 So that's the essential problem of,

45:46.920 --> 45:50.800
 you know, perhaps they realize

45:51.680 --> 45:54.260
 who it is that they're talking to.

45:54.260 --> 45:57.920
 And they say, rather than muddy the picture,

45:57.920 --> 46:00.960
 we're only going to give them limited information.

46:00.960 --> 46:01.800
 Yeah.

46:01.800 --> 46:02.620
 Right?

46:02.620 --> 46:04.380
 And yeah, maybe we could sit down,

46:04.380 --> 46:06.600
 like you and I, and have a conversation.

46:06.600 --> 46:09.080
 But then they would make assumptions.

46:09.080 --> 46:10.800
 The humans would then make assumptions about us

46:10.800 --> 46:12.020
 that aren't true.

46:12.020 --> 46:13.920
 Because we're not humans, right?

46:13.920 --> 46:17.360
 So let's stay at arm's length.

46:17.360 --> 46:21.760
 Let's just let them know that we're here, right?

46:21.760 --> 46:23.780
 And here's the limited amount of communication.

46:23.780 --> 46:25.280
 Again, this notion that

46:26.640 --> 46:29.340
 if you give somebody everything, they'll get lazy.

46:30.520 --> 46:34.120
 And, you know, if they've been around as long as they have,

46:34.120 --> 46:36.760
 they've seen every kind of thing that can go wrong.

46:37.660 --> 46:42.660
 And so they know as much as they might want to step in,

46:42.660 --> 46:44.420
 that that would be a wrong thing.

46:45.660 --> 46:47.180
 Yeah, you have to also understand

46:47.180 --> 46:50.300
 the amount of wisdom they carry.

46:50.300 --> 46:51.140
 Yeah.

46:52.340 --> 46:56.540
 You know, and so it's very easy as well for religions to,

46:56.540 --> 46:58.780
 I don't want to get into a whole religious conversation,

46:58.780 --> 47:00.780
 but it's very easy for,

47:00.780 --> 47:04.220
 you could see how religions could call them angels

47:04.220 --> 47:06.780
 or devils or what have you.

47:06.780 --> 47:08.980
 Because, again, if you're trying to fit it

47:08.980 --> 47:12.240
 into a framework of cultural understanding,

47:12.240 --> 47:14.980
 the first thing you reach for is God.

47:16.040 --> 47:21.040
 And so when you look at what these things are,

47:21.300 --> 47:24.380
 and again, with the angels and the devils,

47:24.380 --> 47:29.380
 in a similar sort of way, their communication is limited.

47:29.460 --> 47:33.300
 They just kind of give little, what's the oracle of Delphi?

47:33.300 --> 47:36.620
 They kind of give these Delphic pronouncements,

47:36.620 --> 47:37.860
 and then it's up to you to figure out

47:37.860 --> 47:39.500
 what it is that they really mean.

47:39.500 --> 47:41.100
 Yeah.

47:41.100 --> 47:45.220
 Steven Greer claimed that a skeleton discovered

47:45.220 --> 47:50.100
 in Atacama region of Chile might be an alien.

47:50.100 --> 47:53.740
 You reached out to him and took on the task

47:53.740 --> 47:57.180
 of proving or disproving that with the rigor of science.

47:57.180 --> 47:59.340
 The result is a paper titled

47:59.340 --> 48:02.100
 Whole Genome Sequencing of Atacama Skeleton

48:02.100 --> 48:05.480
 Shows Novel Mutations Linked with Dysplasia.

48:06.320 --> 48:07.820
 Can you tell this full story?

48:07.820 --> 48:12.820
 Well, the story was, as you put it right there, correct.

48:13.980 --> 48:18.500
 Reached out, got a sample of the body,

48:18.500 --> 48:22.440
 did the DNA sequencing, then worked with a team

48:22.440 --> 48:25.080
 of two other Stanford scientists

48:25.080 --> 48:30.080
 and Roche sequencing group, Roche Diagnostics,

48:30.940 --> 48:33.580
 and probably a total team of about 11 or so people.

48:33.580 --> 48:38.220
 And as is standard in these kinds of things,

48:38.220 --> 48:40.500
 the professors actually don't do the work.

48:40.500 --> 48:43.340
 The students do the work and figured out the answer.

48:44.220 --> 48:46.940
 And then we helped them put together the story.

48:48.560 --> 48:53.560
 And the story was simply that it was human, 100%.

48:54.300 --> 48:57.300
 I went into it thinking it was originally a monkey

48:57.300 --> 48:58.160
 of some sort.

48:59.800 --> 49:02.700
 I got kind of excited a few months into the process,

49:02.700 --> 49:06.300
 thinking, well, what happens if it is an alien, right?

49:06.300 --> 49:08.180
 Can you describe some of the characteristics

49:08.180 --> 49:10.420
 of the skeleton that makes it unique and interesting?

49:10.420 --> 49:13.960
 Primarily, it had dysmorphias of the brain.

49:13.960 --> 49:15.440
 And so the first thing I did actually,

49:15.440 --> 49:17.040
 when I got pictures of it,

49:17.040 --> 49:20.260
 I took it to a local expert at Stanford

49:21.340 --> 49:24.320
 and he was on the paper.

49:24.320 --> 49:29.320
 And he was the world expert in pediatric bone dysmorphias.

49:29.320 --> 49:33.060
 He literally wrote the book on this,

49:33.060 --> 49:33.900
 because that's what you do.

49:33.900 --> 49:35.540
 You go to an expert when it's outside

49:35.540 --> 49:36.980
 of your field of interest.

49:36.980 --> 49:40.860
 And he said, well, I haven't seen this particular collection

49:40.860 --> 49:45.860
 of mutations before or this physiology before,

49:46.420 --> 49:48.220
 but here's what I think it might be.

49:49.540 --> 49:53.540
 And he said, but based on the size of the thing

49:53.540 --> 49:59.540
 and the bone density, it would appear to be like six

49:59.540 --> 50:01.020
 or seven years old.

50:01.020 --> 50:06.020
 Now, again, that's the thing where I think the lay public

50:06.940 --> 50:11.380
 doesn't understand or takes a speculation like that

50:11.380 --> 50:13.500
 and turns it into a fact.

50:13.500 --> 50:15.900
 No one ever said that it was that age.

50:15.900 --> 50:18.420
 We only said that the bones made it look like it was

50:18.420 --> 50:22.100
 that age, but then we went back and looked for,

50:22.100 --> 50:26.660
 we went back and looked for genetic explanations

50:26.660 --> 50:29.060
 of why things might look the way they did.

50:29.060 --> 50:32.580
 And if you, again, read the paper is very carefully

50:32.580 --> 50:37.580
 caveated to say that these mutations might result in this.

50:38.380 --> 50:43.380
 But what we did find was an unexpectedly large number

50:43.460 --> 50:48.140
 of mutations associated with bone growth in this individual.

50:48.140 --> 50:52.180
 And it was just a bad roll of the dice, right?

50:52.180 --> 50:53.620
 You roll the dice enough times

50:53.620 --> 50:56.460
 with enough people born every year

50:56.460 --> 51:01.460
 and someone will roll the wrong dice all at once.

51:02.740 --> 51:06.180
 So the sad part about it was individuals

51:06.180 --> 51:09.540
 in the UFO community who wanted to think

51:09.540 --> 51:14.020
 that there was some sort of conspiracy around it, right?

51:14.020 --> 51:19.020
 That somebody had somehow convinced all of my students to lie.

51:20.500 --> 51:24.340
 I mean, come on, you know, I would lose my job,

51:24.340 --> 51:29.340
 first of all, and they would all be in trouble forever.

51:31.340 --> 51:34.100
 Yeah, but also it's just projecting malevolence

51:34.100 --> 51:37.820
 onto people that doesn't, I don't think exists

51:37.820 --> 51:40.740
 in normal populace and especially doesn't exist

51:40.740 --> 51:42.220
 in the scientific community.

51:42.220 --> 51:43.740
 The kind of people that go into science,

51:43.740 --> 51:44.900
 I mean, this is what bothers me

51:44.900 --> 51:47.460
 with the current distrust of science,

51:47.460 --> 51:51.780
 is they might be naive, they might not,

51:51.780 --> 51:54.500
 especially in modern science, look at the big picture,

51:54.500 --> 51:57.420
 philosophical, ethical questions, all that kind of stuff,

51:57.420 --> 52:02.020
 but ultimately they're people with integrity

52:02.020 --> 52:04.180
 and just a deep curiosity

52:04.180 --> 52:06.820
 for the discovery of cool little things.

52:06.820 --> 52:14.060
 And there's no malevolence, broadly speaking,

52:14.060 --> 52:15.820
 in the scientific community.

52:15.820 --> 52:17.660
 So, I mean, there's a bigger story here,

52:17.660 --> 52:22.300
 which is, you know, there's a hunger in the populace

52:22.300 --> 52:25.700
 to discover something anomalous, something new.

52:25.700 --> 52:31.780
 And, you know, science has to be both open to the anomalous,

52:31.780 --> 52:35.340
 but also to reject the anomalous

52:35.340 --> 52:37.460
 when the data doesn't support it.

52:37.460 --> 52:39.460
 What do you make of that, you know,

52:39.460 --> 52:40.780
 walking that line for you?

52:40.780 --> 52:42.820
 Because you're dealing with UFO encounters,

52:42.820 --> 52:45.700
 you're dealing with the anomalous.

52:45.700 --> 52:49.980
 Well, people have said, let's go back to the Atacama case

52:49.980 --> 52:52.100
 that I was debunking it.

52:52.100 --> 52:54.300
 Well, debunking is a loaded term.

52:54.300 --> 52:57.700
 Sort of assumes that you were going in purposefully

52:57.700 --> 53:00.580
 to prove something is wrong.

53:00.580 --> 53:03.940
 I wasn't, I was just going in to collect the data.

53:03.940 --> 53:08.140
 And, you know, I showed that this one was human.

53:08.140 --> 53:11.220
 There was another skull that somebody had at one point.

53:11.220 --> 53:12.300
 It was called the star child.

53:12.300 --> 53:14.140
 They called it the star child skull.

53:14.140 --> 53:15.780
 I said, you know, I looked at it.

53:15.780 --> 53:18.020
 I looked at the DNA sequencing that they had done.

53:18.020 --> 53:19.900
 I said, this is human.

53:19.900 --> 53:22.420
 End of story.

53:22.420 --> 53:26.340
 The people who owned the thing at the time disagreed with me,

53:26.340 --> 53:28.540
 and then eventually another group came in

53:28.540 --> 53:30.700
 and proved that I was right.

53:30.700 --> 53:32.380
 And it's not about debunking.

53:32.380 --> 53:36.740
 It's about getting the more spectacular and hyped cases

53:36.740 --> 53:37.580
 off the table.

53:37.580 --> 53:39.300
 I mean, the reason I got interested in it

53:39.300 --> 53:41.100
 is because somebody was hyping it.

53:41.100 --> 53:42.780
 And not because I wanted to disprove it,

53:42.780 --> 53:44.620
 but because I just wanted to know.

53:44.620 --> 53:46.860
 And thus, get it off the table, because it's usually

53:46.860 --> 53:52.620
 the most extravagant things that are most likely to be wrong.

53:52.620 --> 53:57.380
 Somewhere in the rubble will be something interesting.

53:57.380 --> 53:58.660
 And so that's what you do.

53:58.660 --> 54:02.340
 You get the dross off the table.

54:02.340 --> 54:04.940
 And then somewhere in the data will

54:04.940 --> 54:09.580
 be something worth real inquiry.

54:09.580 --> 54:12.420
 And that, if you inquire deeply enough,

54:12.420 --> 54:13.820
 will be extravagant as well.

54:13.820 --> 54:15.060
 Yes, exactly.

54:15.060 --> 54:18.340
 And that's what actually excites scientists is to, I mean,

54:18.340 --> 54:21.100
 you want, with the rigor of science,

54:21.100 --> 54:24.140
 to actually reveal the extravagant.

54:24.140 --> 54:26.740
 And so look at CRISPR as probably the most perfect

54:26.740 --> 54:27.940
 example of that.

54:27.940 --> 54:32.780
 These weird sequences in bacterial genomes,

54:32.780 --> 54:36.540
 all arrayed one after the other with these strange sequences

54:36.540 --> 54:38.620
 around them, but when you looked at the sequences,

54:38.620 --> 54:41.140
 they looked like viruses.

54:41.140 --> 54:42.820
 And so how did they get there?

54:42.820 --> 54:46.100
 And lo and behold, after a lot of effort and work,

54:46.100 --> 54:48.900
 well, a couple of Nobel Prizes went out the door.

54:48.900 --> 54:52.780
 But these strange things ended up

54:52.780 --> 54:57.920
 having extraordinarily extravagant possibilities.

54:57.920 --> 55:00.100
 You've also looked at UFO materials.

55:00.100 --> 55:03.820
 You are in possession of UFO materials yourself.

55:03.820 --> 55:07.100
 Claimed UFO materials, alleged.

55:07.100 --> 55:08.940
 Alleged UFO materials, that's right.

55:08.940 --> 55:11.580
 So what's another term?

55:11.580 --> 55:17.500
 Weird materials that don't seem to have a story.

55:17.500 --> 55:20.140
 They have a story that doesn't seem to be of natural origins,

55:20.140 --> 55:25.980
 but it's not, you know, there's a process to proving that.

55:25.980 --> 55:30.660
 And that process may take decades, if not centuries,

55:30.660 --> 55:33.300
 because you have to keep pulling at the string

55:33.300 --> 55:35.820
 and discover where they could possibly come from.

55:35.820 --> 55:37.660
 But anyway, you're in a possession

55:37.660 --> 55:41.540
 of some materials of this kind.

55:41.540 --> 55:45.780
 Can you describe some of them and maybe also

55:45.780 --> 55:48.540
 talk to the process of how you investigate them,

55:48.540 --> 55:50.100
 how do you analyze them?

55:50.100 --> 55:53.900
 Right, so let's say that there's two classes of materials

55:53.900 --> 55:56.380
 that I've been given by people.

55:56.380 --> 55:58.380
 And they're not given by the government or anything,

55:58.380 --> 56:00.220
 just given people who've collected them,

56:00.220 --> 56:03.140
 and there's a reasonable chain of evidence associated

56:03.140 --> 56:05.900
 with them that you believe is not just a pebble somebody

56:05.900 --> 56:06.820
 picked up off a road.

56:09.500 --> 56:12.020
 There are almost always things that people have claimed

56:12.020 --> 56:15.500
 have either been dropped off as like some sort

56:15.500 --> 56:19.280
 of a leftover material, molten metals,

56:19.280 --> 56:26.580
 or they are from an object that was released from this

56:26.580 --> 56:29.500
 or that kind of exploded.

56:29.500 --> 56:31.040
 They're almost always metals.

56:31.040 --> 56:32.460
 I have some couple of things that

56:32.460 --> 56:34.780
 might be biological that are interesting that I haven't

56:34.780 --> 56:36.500
 really spent a lot of time on yet.

56:36.500 --> 56:39.920
 When you look at a metal, you basically, well, OK,

56:39.920 --> 56:42.260
 what are the elements in it?

56:42.260 --> 56:44.460
 And what's it made of?

56:44.460 --> 56:47.840
 And so there's pretty standard approaches to doing that.

56:47.840 --> 56:49.540
 Most of them involve a technology

56:49.540 --> 56:52.180
 called mass spectrometry, and there's probably

56:52.180 --> 56:54.300
 about five or six different kinds of mass spectrometry

56:54.300 --> 56:57.620
 that you could bring to bear on answering it.

56:57.620 --> 56:59.500
 And they either tell you, depending

56:59.500 --> 57:02.260
 upon the limit of the resolution of the instrument,

57:02.260 --> 57:05.220
 they either tell you the elements that are there,

57:05.220 --> 57:07.140
 or they tell you the isotopes that are there.

57:07.140 --> 57:09.680
 And you're interested not just in knowing whether something

57:09.680 --> 57:12.620
 is there or not, you're interested in knowing

57:12.620 --> 57:17.740
 whether there are the amounts of it,

57:17.740 --> 57:22.300
 and in the case of elements, how many different isotopes

57:22.300 --> 57:23.540
 are there.

57:23.540 --> 57:25.900
 And that's kind of where, in some of these cases,

57:25.900 --> 57:27.580
 it gets interesting.

57:27.580 --> 57:30.620
 Because in at least one of the materials,

57:30.620 --> 57:34.500
 as we first studied it, the isotope ratios of, in this case,

57:34.500 --> 57:37.380
 it was magnesium, are way off normal.

57:37.380 --> 57:40.060
 And I just don't know why.

57:40.060 --> 57:43.260
 It doesn't prove anything.

57:43.260 --> 57:48.500
 All it proves is that it was probably accomplished

57:48.500 --> 57:51.300
 by some kind of an industrial process.

57:51.300 --> 57:55.140
 Whether it's the result of a process,

57:55.140 --> 57:57.420
 and this is sort of the leftover,

57:57.420 --> 58:01.740
 or whether it was made that way for a particular purpose,

58:01.740 --> 58:02.740
 I don't know.

58:02.740 --> 58:09.860
 All I know is that it was engineered.

58:09.860 --> 58:11.540
 That's it.

58:11.540 --> 58:16.980
 But then the question is, sort of you go one step deeper,

58:16.980 --> 58:20.340
 why would you engineer it?

58:20.340 --> 58:21.380
 Right.

58:21.380 --> 58:24.260
 Why engineer it, and what does engineered means?

58:24.260 --> 58:27.260
 There's all kinds of, it could be a byproduct,

58:27.260 --> 58:34.220
 it could be the main result of an engineering process,

58:34.220 --> 58:37.580
 it would be a small part of the engineering process that

58:37.580 --> 58:39.140
 is the main part.

58:39.140 --> 58:43.860
 Well, so the ratios of isotopes for any given element

58:43.860 --> 58:48.540
 are basically the result of stellar processes.

58:48.540 --> 58:55.620
 Supernova blew up sometime several billion years ago.

58:55.620 --> 58:56.940
 That became a cloud.

58:56.940 --> 59:00.660
 Those atoms coalesced gravitationally

59:00.660 --> 59:07.100
 to form another sun, and a ring that became a rocky planet.

59:07.100 --> 59:11.100
 And the ratios of the isotopes were determined

59:11.100 --> 59:14.500
 at the time of that explosion.

59:14.500 --> 59:17.260
 And so everything in the local solar system

59:17.260 --> 59:20.180
 is more or less of that ratio, depending

59:20.180 --> 59:22.260
 upon certain gravitational difference.

59:22.260 --> 59:28.500
 But by fragments of a percent, not whole tens of percent

59:28.500 --> 59:29.700
 difference.

59:29.700 --> 59:32.580
 So what do humans use isotopes for?

59:32.580 --> 59:34.220
 Mostly to blow stuff up.

59:34.220 --> 59:36.500
 I mean, the vast majority of the isotopes

59:36.500 --> 59:40.700
 that have been made in the per pound or ton

59:40.700 --> 59:44.540
 are things like certain ratios of plutonium and uranium

59:44.540 --> 59:45.780
 to blow stuff up.

59:45.780 --> 59:51.180
 We don't make or engineer isotopes, which today

59:51.180 --> 59:54.100
 is relatively easy to do, but it's still expensive.

59:54.100 --> 1:00:00.540
 For any other reason, apart from, let's say, anti cancer,

1:00:00.540 --> 1:00:03.700
 we use stable isotopes and money these days

1:00:03.700 --> 1:00:04.860
 as a counterfeiting tool.

1:00:04.860 --> 1:00:08.220
 You basically embed certain ratios of isotopes

1:00:08.220 --> 1:00:14.140
 in to make it harder for counterfeiters to accomplish.

1:00:14.140 --> 1:00:16.660
 But other than that, we don't do anything with that.

1:00:16.660 --> 1:00:21.940
 So why would you make grams of such material in this one case

1:00:21.940 --> 1:00:25.460
 and drop it around on a beach in Brazil?

1:00:25.460 --> 1:00:26.940
 So which case are we talking about?

1:00:26.940 --> 1:00:30.620
 Describe that, because this is the Ubatuba case.

1:00:30.620 --> 1:00:32.660
 Can you describe this case a little bit further,

1:00:32.660 --> 1:00:35.300
 like what material we're talking about, just the full story

1:00:35.300 --> 1:00:36.580
 of the case?

1:00:36.580 --> 1:00:37.580
 It's an interesting one.

1:00:37.580 --> 1:00:38.580
 It's an interesting one.

1:00:38.580 --> 1:00:43.420
 So a fisherman saw an object that released something,

1:00:43.420 --> 1:00:45.860
 or it exploded.

1:00:45.860 --> 1:00:51.420
 And it was this relatively, I've got some big chunks of it,

1:00:51.420 --> 1:00:55.260
 relatively pure magnesium with obviously something else in it

1:00:55.260 --> 1:00:56.820
 because magnesium burns.

1:00:56.820 --> 1:01:00.660
 So it had something in it that would, other metals,

1:01:00.660 --> 1:01:07.900
 simple alloy that would prevent it from basically burning up.

1:01:07.900 --> 1:01:10.900
 And so the question is, and so then we

1:01:10.900 --> 1:01:15.660
 had two pieces that came from two different chains of custody,

1:01:15.660 --> 1:01:19.420
 both claimed to be from the same object.

1:01:19.420 --> 1:01:23.220
 At least physically, when you look at the two things,

1:01:23.220 --> 1:01:26.980
 they look the same.

1:01:26.980 --> 1:01:29.820
 So we took small fragments of each of them.

1:01:29.820 --> 1:01:32.260
 We put them in an instrument called a secondary ion mass

1:01:32.260 --> 1:01:35.900
 spec, which is an extremely sensitive instrument.

1:01:35.900 --> 1:01:41.740
 And it can see down to 0.0001 mass units,

1:01:41.740 --> 1:01:46.100
 which is important for, let's say, more arcane reasons.

1:01:46.100 --> 1:01:48.780
 But it's a sensitive instrument.

1:01:48.780 --> 1:01:52.900
 And so one of the chains of custody,

1:01:52.900 --> 1:01:55.860
 we had two pieces from the same chain of custody,

1:01:55.860 --> 1:01:59.380
 and then two pieces from the other chain of custody.

1:01:59.380 --> 1:02:04.140
 One of them had completely normal magnesium isotope

1:02:04.140 --> 1:02:06.540
 ratios, magnesium 24, 25, 26.

1:02:06.540 --> 1:02:09.740
 And the other was off, not just slightly off, way off.

1:02:09.740 --> 1:02:11.420
 And they were both off to the same extent.

1:02:14.860 --> 1:02:18.020
 I mean, it was sort of like you had an internal control

1:02:18.020 --> 1:02:18.860
 of what was normal.

1:02:18.860 --> 1:02:22.340
 And you had this other one, which was wrong.

1:02:22.340 --> 1:02:28.540
 And so you're left with kind of an open question.

1:02:28.540 --> 1:02:29.900
 Was this a hoax?

1:02:29.900 --> 1:02:32.420
 Were these two chains of custody, one of them a hoax,

1:02:32.420 --> 1:02:35.100
 that somebody purposefully introduced those things?

1:02:35.100 --> 1:02:36.300
 Because you could do it.

1:02:36.300 --> 1:02:38.420
 It would cost a lot.

1:02:38.420 --> 1:02:40.780
 I mean, at the time that this was found,

1:02:40.780 --> 1:02:45.020
 I guess the 1970s or so, it might have been earlier,

1:02:45.020 --> 1:02:49.260
 I forget, the amount that I had would

1:02:49.260 --> 1:02:53.940
 have cost several tens of thousands of dollars to make.

1:02:53.940 --> 1:02:56.180
 And again, it's not something you would just throw around.

1:02:56.180 --> 1:02:58.860
 And why would you do it in the hope that some guy 30 years

1:02:58.860 --> 1:03:02.500
 from then would pick it up and study it?

1:03:02.500 --> 1:03:05.100
 Yeah, it's a very subtle, subtle troll.

1:03:05.100 --> 1:03:08.140
 It's a long term plan.

1:03:08.140 --> 1:03:12.340
 So I just don't know what to make of it,

1:03:12.340 --> 1:03:15.100
 except it's interesting.

1:03:15.100 --> 1:03:17.620
 So a different kind of question that you're asking

1:03:17.620 --> 1:03:21.500
 is, what constitutes evidence?

1:03:21.500 --> 1:03:27.700
 So is this sufficient evidence? Absolutely not.

1:03:27.700 --> 1:03:29.660
 But somebody's put it forward.

1:03:29.660 --> 1:03:30.460
 I have the time.

1:03:30.460 --> 1:03:33.020
 It's my time.

1:03:33.020 --> 1:03:33.740
 I'll study it.

1:03:33.740 --> 1:03:36.140
 And my objective is to sort of take

1:03:36.140 --> 1:03:38.460
 those that I think are credible enough

1:03:38.460 --> 1:03:41.220
 and do a reasonable analysis, put it out there.

1:03:41.220 --> 1:03:43.260
 And maybe somebody else will come up with an idea

1:03:43.260 --> 1:03:44.580
 as to what it is.

1:03:44.580 --> 1:03:51.140
 Now, what would be better is some sort of true technology,

1:03:51.140 --> 1:03:53.100
 something that is obviously.

1:03:53.100 --> 1:03:55.020
 We don't have it.

1:03:55.020 --> 1:04:00.460
 And people like Neil deGrasse Tyson and Seth Shostak

1:04:00.460 --> 1:04:04.020
 have come out rightfully and have said,

1:04:04.020 --> 1:04:11.780
 when you show up with something really obviously technology

1:04:11.780 --> 1:04:16.180
 that we don't understand, then we'll pay attention.

1:04:16.180 --> 1:04:17.260
 Not just material.

1:04:17.260 --> 1:04:18.260
 Not just material.

1:04:18.260 --> 1:04:24.100
 A piece of metal is interesting.

1:04:24.100 --> 1:04:26.020
 And several of the things that I've looked at

1:04:26.020 --> 1:04:29.580
 and other things that people have come to me with,

1:04:29.580 --> 1:04:32.100
 we've found to be completely banal

1:04:32.100 --> 1:04:35.780
 or were actually pieces of aircraft

1:04:35.780 --> 1:04:38.580
 that were invented back in the 1940s.

1:04:38.580 --> 1:04:40.780
 And so take them off the table.

1:04:40.780 --> 1:04:46.740
 But I think, again, I think showing up

1:04:46.740 --> 1:04:50.580
 with technology that we humans would find completely novel

1:04:50.580 --> 1:04:53.460
 is actually a really difficult task for aliens

1:04:53.460 --> 1:04:56.820
 because it obviously can't be so novel

1:04:56.820 --> 1:05:00.340
 that we don't recognize it for what it is.

1:05:00.340 --> 1:05:04.340
 And I would say most of the technology aliens likely have

1:05:04.340 --> 1:05:07.500
 would be something we don't recognize.

1:05:07.500 --> 1:05:11.900
 So it's actually a hard problem how to convince ants.

1:05:11.900 --> 1:05:16.300
 You first have to understand what ants are tweeting about.

1:05:16.300 --> 1:05:21.420
 What they care about in order to inject into their culture.

1:05:21.420 --> 1:05:26.940
 Because that's why I think it would be the technology

1:05:26.940 --> 1:05:29.660
 that you could present is in the space of ideas,

1:05:29.660 --> 1:05:35.780
 is try to influence individual humans with the encounters

1:05:35.780 --> 1:05:39.780
 and try to, with this kind of thing that you mentioned

1:05:39.780 --> 1:05:46.460
 about us not taking messages, about us not taking care of the world.

1:05:46.460 --> 1:05:49.700
 It's difficult. I mean, for them to understand,

1:05:49.700 --> 1:05:52.420
 you have to come up with trinkets that impress us.

1:05:52.420 --> 1:05:56.020
 I mean, maybe the very technology,

1:05:56.020 --> 1:05:58.540
 the fascination with the development of technology

1:05:58.540 --> 1:06:00.420
 and the development of technology,

1:06:00.420 --> 1:06:03.140
 the actual act of innovation itself

1:06:03.140 --> 1:06:05.980
 is the thing that they're communicating.

1:06:05.980 --> 1:06:11.380
 I mean, this is kind of what Jacques Vallée thinks about, is the role of...

1:06:11.380 --> 1:06:13.220
 The control system, he calls it.

1:06:13.220 --> 1:06:16.620
 The control system. Well, let me ask about Jacques.

1:06:16.620 --> 1:06:22.860
 Who is he? You know him. Who is Jacques Vallée?

1:06:22.860 --> 1:06:30.220
 What have you learned from him about life, about UFOs,

1:06:30.220 --> 1:06:33.500
 about technology, about our role in the universe?

1:06:33.500 --> 1:06:40.340
 Well, I met Jacques actually soon after the whole Atacama thing happened.

1:06:40.340 --> 1:06:43.900
 I was visited by those people associated with the government

1:06:43.900 --> 1:06:47.580
 and whatever around the Havana...

1:06:47.580 --> 1:06:50.220
 What ended up mostly being Havana syndrome patients,

1:06:50.220 --> 1:06:51.500
 but also Jacques at the same time.

1:06:51.500 --> 1:06:54.500
 And they were actually working behind the scenes with each other,

1:06:54.500 --> 1:06:57.260
 that, oh, here's this Stanford professor

1:06:57.260 --> 1:07:01.500
 who is willing to talk about this stuff and investigate things.

1:07:01.500 --> 1:07:03.060
 Maybe we should go talk to him.

1:07:03.060 --> 1:07:06.060
 And he reached out through a colleague

1:07:06.060 --> 1:07:12.380
 and he and I had lunch actually at the Rosewood Inn up on near Sandhill.

1:07:12.380 --> 1:07:19.820
 So Jacques is one of the first openly active scientists,

1:07:19.820 --> 1:07:26.220
 and he's really a scientist, in this area going back to the 1960s.

1:07:26.220 --> 1:07:31.820
 And he's put forward a number of ideas,

1:07:31.820 --> 1:07:36.060
 speculations about what it might be that people are interacting with.

1:07:36.060 --> 1:07:38.220
 And the first thing that I learned from him

1:07:38.220 --> 1:07:41.620
 is this notion of what he called Kabuki theater,

1:07:41.620 --> 1:07:45.180
 that many of the things that people have seen are...

1:07:45.180 --> 1:07:47.180
 I remember reading his books and thinking,

1:07:47.180 --> 1:07:50.580
 he uses this word absurd a lot.

1:07:50.580 --> 1:07:56.500
 He said, the things that people claim they see are absurd, right?

1:07:56.500 --> 1:08:00.820
 A ship doesn't land in a farmer's field

1:08:00.820 --> 1:08:02.620
 and then come up and knock on the door and say,

1:08:02.620 --> 1:08:03.900
 can I have a glass of water?

1:08:03.900 --> 1:08:08.100
 And these are stories literally out of newspapers from the 1930s.

1:08:08.100 --> 1:08:09.660
 It's absurd.

1:08:09.660 --> 1:08:12.620
 And the other thing that people say, ships don't crash.

1:08:12.620 --> 1:08:15.740
 If you're so technologically advanced, you don't crash.

1:08:15.740 --> 1:08:18.620
 It's absurd that they crash.

1:08:18.620 --> 1:08:24.580
 So he says, this is put on as a show.

1:08:24.580 --> 1:08:29.420
 It's an influence campaign, right?

1:08:29.420 --> 1:08:31.860
 It's not meant to influence individuals.

1:08:31.860 --> 1:08:35.700
 It's meant to influence a culture as a whole.

1:08:35.700 --> 1:08:37.620
 Maybe they don't look at us as individuals.

1:08:37.620 --> 1:08:43.460
 Maybe they look at us as an organism that lives on a planet, right?

1:08:43.460 --> 1:08:45.220
 And perhaps rightly so.

1:08:45.220 --> 1:08:47.140
 And so that's how you interact with them.

1:08:47.140 --> 1:08:48.860
 That's how you influence them.

1:08:48.860 --> 1:08:51.420
 So that was one of the first things that kind of took me back

1:08:51.420 --> 1:08:53.780
 and realized, wow, there's actually...

1:08:53.780 --> 1:09:00.580
 maybe there's a puppet master behind the scenes that's doing this influencing

1:09:00.580 --> 1:09:05.140
 and that all this stuff about aliens is just not true, per se.

1:09:05.140 --> 1:09:09.740
 They're just a representation of something that is meant to influence.

1:09:09.740 --> 1:09:11.220
 So that was probably the most interesting.

1:09:11.220 --> 1:09:13.340
 I mean, the man is brilliant.

1:09:13.340 --> 1:09:18.420
 He's also, and I'm sorry, Jacques, he can also be incredibly annoying

1:09:18.420 --> 1:09:23.660
 to have a conversation with because he will pick apart your arguments

1:09:23.660 --> 1:09:25.500
 or anything that you think you know

1:09:25.500 --> 1:09:28.900
 and show you why you don't know what you think you know.

1:09:28.900 --> 1:09:34.980
 And he used the example that, for me, that is all you need

1:09:34.980 --> 1:09:41.540
 is one counter example to any conclusion and you're wrong.

1:09:41.540 --> 1:09:43.500
 And so I learned from him...

1:09:43.500 --> 1:09:47.180
 I mean, I'm supposed to be a good scientist, but I learned from him,

1:09:47.180 --> 1:09:50.820
 don't talk about conclusions, just talk about the data

1:09:50.820 --> 1:09:52.060
 because data is not wrong.

1:09:52.060 --> 1:09:55.820
 I mean, convince yourself that the data is not wrong or not an artifact,

1:09:55.820 --> 1:09:58.660
 but be careful about your conclusions because whatever is going on,

1:09:58.660 --> 1:10:02.980
 it's much more complicated than we imagine.

1:10:02.980 --> 1:10:03.820
 Wow, that's powerful.

1:10:03.820 --> 1:10:07.460
 Being able to always step back because we humans get excited.

1:10:07.460 --> 1:10:07.700
 Yeah.

1:10:07.700 --> 1:10:11.500
 We start to jump to conclusions from the data, but always step back.

1:10:11.500 --> 1:10:11.700
 Well...

1:10:11.700 --> 1:10:15.580
 Powerful, being able to always step back because we humans get excited.

1:10:15.580 --> 1:10:15.820
 Yeah.

1:10:15.820 --> 1:10:19.620
 We start to jump to conclusions from the data, but always step back.

1:10:19.620 --> 1:10:23.420
 Well, in some of my Twitter feeds, when I dare to go on Twitter,

1:10:23.420 --> 1:10:27.340
 are full of, well, when are you going to give us the answer?

1:10:27.340 --> 1:10:29.180
 Science is not immediate.

1:10:29.180 --> 1:10:31.020
 You're going to have to be patient.

1:10:31.020 --> 1:10:35.060
 And even some of my science colleagues have said, well, where's the data?

1:10:35.060 --> 1:10:39.940
 My answer to them has been, where's been your work to try to produce any?

1:10:39.940 --> 1:10:43.580
 I'm not here to give you everything on a silver platter.

1:10:43.580 --> 1:10:48.260
 We talked offline how much I love data and machine learning and so on.

1:10:48.260 --> 1:10:51.620
 And it's been really disheartening to see the U.S.

1:10:51.620 --> 1:10:56.940
 government not invest as much as they possibly could into this whole process.

1:10:56.940 --> 1:11:01.540
 So let's jump to the most recent thing, which is what do you make of the report

1:11:01.540 --> 1:11:08.260
 titled Preliminary Assessment, Unidentified Aerial Phenomena that was released by the

1:11:08.260 --> 1:11:12.740
 Office of the Director of National Intelligence in June 2021.

1:11:12.740 --> 1:11:18.980
 So this is what's like, okay, we're going to step back and we're going to like,

1:11:18.980 --> 1:11:21.500
 where do we stand and where do we hope the future is?

1:11:21.500 --> 1:11:22.540
 What do you make of that report?

1:11:22.540 --> 1:11:23.700
 Is it hopeful?

1:11:23.700 --> 1:11:24.220
 Is it?

1:11:24.220 --> 1:11:26.860
 I see it as very hopeful, very hopeful.

1:11:26.860 --> 1:11:31.860
 I think the adults are finally stepping up and being in charge, right?

1:11:31.860 --> 1:11:33.700
 In the good sense of adult.

1:11:33.700 --> 1:11:34.300
 What's that?

1:11:34.300 --> 1:11:37.580
 In the good sense of adult.

1:11:37.580 --> 1:11:40.380
 This childlike curiosity is a pretty powerful thing.

1:11:40.380 --> 1:11:42.260
 That's true, yeah.

1:11:42.260 --> 1:11:47.580
 But it's also, I think, the people who were worried that the populace at large might run

1:11:47.580 --> 1:11:53.180
 screaming into the streets and riot, you know, have, you know, they basically,

1:11:53.180 --> 1:11:55.300
 the empiric evidence is they're wrong.

1:11:55.300 --> 1:12:00.460
 You know, these videos and all these things have been out for now, what, five years?

1:12:00.460 --> 1:12:02.780
 Most people don't even know about it, right?

1:12:02.780 --> 1:12:08.780
 So as hyped as it's been and all over the newspapers that it's been and et cetera,

1:12:08.780 --> 1:12:14.460
 you know, even Tucker Carlson has talked about it many times on his news program.

1:12:14.460 --> 1:12:15.380
 Joe Rogan has.

1:12:15.380 --> 1:12:16.820
 A lot of people don't know about it.

1:12:16.820 --> 1:12:20.700
 So I think people, if it's not affecting their day to day life,

1:12:20.700 --> 1:12:23.220
 they're going on with their day to day life.

1:12:23.220 --> 1:12:30.020
 So, but that said, I think it was an important sea change in the internal

1:12:30.020 --> 1:12:35.460
 discussions going on in the government because, and the reason being,

1:12:35.460 --> 1:12:43.020
 that I think this is actually partly true with the maturation of human social technology.

1:12:43.020 --> 1:12:49.060
 It was becoming so obvious that this stuff was showing up again and again and again around our ships.

1:12:49.060 --> 1:12:51.820
 They just couldn't keep it quiet anymore, right?

1:12:51.820 --> 1:12:53.900
 And so it's like, we need to do something about it.

1:12:53.900 --> 1:13:00.580
 And Lou Elizondo and Chris and others, to their great credit, found the right angle to talk about this.

1:13:00.580 --> 1:13:04.220
 It says, well, okay, let's say it's not out there.

1:13:04.220 --> 1:13:06.860
 Maybe it's the Russians, the Chinese or somebody else.

1:13:06.860 --> 1:13:11.380
 We should know about this because we damn sure know it's not us.

1:13:11.380 --> 1:13:20.660
 So that to me is an important thing to finally be a little bit more open about the matter.

1:13:20.660 --> 1:13:26.140
 But like I often say, I'm not looking for people to give me permission to do anything.

1:13:26.140 --> 1:13:29.180
 I'm just going to do the analysis myself with what I have.

1:13:29.180 --> 1:13:31.900
 Avi Loeb has taken the same approach.

1:13:31.900 --> 1:13:38.420
 He said, I'm not going to wait for the government to give me telescopic information about technologies

1:13:38.420 --> 1:13:41.940
 or things that might be even on our own solar system.

1:13:41.940 --> 1:13:44.140
 I'm just going to collect it myself.

1:13:44.140 --> 1:13:46.420
 And that's the right way to do it, right?

1:13:46.420 --> 1:13:48.740
 Don't wait for somebody else to give it to you.

1:13:48.740 --> 1:13:55.540
 It's also possible to inspire a large number of people to do a wider spread data collection.

1:13:55.540 --> 1:13:55.900
 Yes.

1:13:55.900 --> 1:14:00.700
 I mean, you yourself can't do a large enough data collection that would,

1:14:00.700 --> 1:14:08.740
 if you're talking about anomalous events, you should be collecting high resolution data

1:14:08.740 --> 1:14:15.660
 about everything that's happening on Earth in terms of like, in terms of the kind of things

1:14:15.660 --> 1:14:20.100
 that would indicate to you a strong signal that something weird happened here.

1:14:20.100 --> 1:14:26.180
 And this is why governments can be good at funding large scale efforts.

1:14:26.180 --> 1:14:26.740
 Yes.

1:14:26.740 --> 1:14:33.940
 I mean, you know, NASA and so on, working with SpaceX, with Blue Origin, you know,

1:14:33.940 --> 1:14:42.260
 fund capitalistic sort of fund companies, fund company efforts to do huge moonshot projects.

1:14:42.260 --> 1:14:43.060
 Right.

1:14:43.060 --> 1:14:47.860
 And in the same way, do huge moonshot data collection efforts in terms of UFOs.

1:14:47.860 --> 1:14:53.540
 I mean, we're not, it needs to be like 10X, like one or two orders of magnitude more funding.

1:14:53.540 --> 1:14:53.860
 Exactly.

1:14:53.860 --> 1:14:55.180
 To do this kind of thing.

1:14:55.180 --> 1:14:59.740
 And I understand on the flip side of that, if you make it about what are the Russians,

1:14:59.740 --> 1:15:06.620
 whether the Chinese doing, you know, make it a question of geopolitics, it gets touchy.

1:15:06.620 --> 1:15:11.660
 Because now you're kind of taken away from the realm of science and...

1:15:11.660 --> 1:15:12.700
 Making it military.

1:15:12.700 --> 1:15:13.660
 Making it military.

1:15:13.660 --> 1:15:18.620
 Some of the greatest, this is what makes me as an engineer, makes me truly sad that some

1:15:18.620 --> 1:15:24.940
 of the greatest engineering work ever done is by Lockheed Martin, and we will never know about it.

1:15:24.940 --> 1:15:25.420
 Yeah.

1:15:25.420 --> 1:15:26.060
 I agree.

1:15:26.060 --> 1:15:26.540
 I agree.

1:15:26.540 --> 1:15:31.580
 I wish we were, it was different, but it's the world we live in.

1:15:33.340 --> 1:15:39.580
 You know, but related to that UIP task force announcement that you just said, you know,

1:15:39.580 --> 1:15:43.740
 the bill was passed in the Department of Defense and now it formally establishes an office

1:15:44.620 --> 1:15:49.580
 to collate that information and also to be transparent about it.

1:15:50.380 --> 1:15:52.780
 Money is now set aside, right?

1:15:52.780 --> 1:15:57.580
 What do you think of it, just in case people don't know, the DOD establishing new department

1:15:57.580 --> 1:16:02.780
 to study UFOs called Airborne Naming Command.

1:16:02.780 --> 1:16:07.100
 But yes, Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group.

1:16:07.980 --> 1:16:08.940
 Do you know how to pronounce that?

1:16:08.940 --> 1:16:09.740
 No, I do not.

1:16:09.740 --> 1:16:09.980
 No.

1:16:09.980 --> 1:16:11.980
 AOI MSG.

1:16:11.980 --> 1:16:13.820
 It's stupid and needs to be renamed, but...

1:16:13.820 --> 1:16:15.020
 AOI MSG.

1:16:15.660 --> 1:16:22.300
 AO, all right, is directed by the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security.

1:16:22.300 --> 1:16:23.500
 What do you make of this office?

1:16:24.060 --> 1:16:26.460
 Are you hopeful about this office?

1:16:26.460 --> 1:16:30.700
 I think there's still a tug of war going on behind the scenes as to who's going to control

1:16:30.700 --> 1:16:31.200
 this.

1:16:32.220 --> 1:16:40.460
 But I do know, though, that money has been set aside that will be used to make things

1:16:41.020 --> 1:16:45.100
 more public, right, to start to get others involved.

1:16:45.100 --> 1:16:51.660
 And, you know, I'm involved with an effort to get other academics involved.

1:16:51.660 --> 1:16:55.820
 So you think there might be some of that money could be directed towards funding maybe like

1:16:55.820 --> 1:16:59.020
 groups like yours to do some research here.

1:16:59.020 --> 1:17:01.020
 So they would be open to that, you think?

1:17:01.020 --> 1:17:01.740
 I hope so.

1:17:01.740 --> 1:17:04.060
 I mean, nothing is set in stone yet.

1:17:04.060 --> 1:17:08.460
 So, you know, and I'm not hiding anything because I just don't know anything, right.

1:17:08.460 --> 1:17:14.700
 But I do think that there will be public efforts.

1:17:14.700 --> 1:17:21.580
 Now, there are being set up other private efforts to bring monies involved and to use

1:17:21.580 --> 1:17:27.580
 that to leverage and get access to some of the internal resources as well.

1:17:28.140 --> 1:17:36.140
 So what you're seeing is kind of an ecosystem building up in a positive sense of people

1:17:36.140 --> 1:17:38.540
 who are willing to do the research.

1:17:39.420 --> 1:17:43.980
 So, you know, before it would be you couldn't even go to a scientist and ask them to help.

1:17:45.100 --> 1:17:50.060
 Now, if there's money, as I said before, scientists are essentially capitalists.

1:17:50.060 --> 1:17:51.660
 We go where the money is.

1:17:52.220 --> 1:17:54.780
 I mean, the work that I've done, I did out of my own pocket.

1:17:55.980 --> 1:18:01.660
 And probably about $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 of money went into the paper we published

1:18:02.220 --> 1:18:03.180
 out of my own pocket.

1:18:05.580 --> 1:18:10.540
 But the amount of money that needs to go in is in at least the few millions to do

1:18:10.540 --> 1:18:12.940
 a proper analysis of these materials.

1:18:12.940 --> 1:18:19.580
 The work I know that the Galileo project is involved with, it's probably in the, you

1:18:19.580 --> 1:18:22.620
 know, 5 to 10 million range to get stuff done.

1:18:22.620 --> 1:18:28.140
 But that's actually a relatively modest amount of money to accomplish something that

1:18:28.140 --> 1:18:31.500
 has been in the zeitgeist for decades.

1:18:32.940 --> 1:18:37.100
 I should also push back a little bit on something you probably will agree with.

1:18:37.100 --> 1:18:39.180
 You said scientists are essentially capitalists.

1:18:39.180 --> 1:18:43.820
 What I've noticed is there's certainly an influence of money, but oftentimes when you're

1:18:43.820 --> 1:18:52.380
 talking about basic research and basic science, the money is a little bit ambiguous to what

1:18:52.380 --> 1:18:54.380
 direction you're doing the research in.

1:18:54.380 --> 1:19:00.220
 And the scientists get really good at telling a narrative of like, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're

1:19:00.220 --> 1:19:05.740
 fulfilling the purpose of this funding, but we're actually, they end up doing really what

1:19:05.740 --> 1:19:06.700
 they're curious about.

1:19:06.700 --> 1:19:07.180
 Yes.

1:19:07.180 --> 1:19:11.900
 And of course you cannot deviate like if you're getting funded to study penguins in Antarctica,

1:19:11.900 --> 1:19:17.420
 you can't start building rockets, but probably you can because you will convince some kind,

1:19:17.420 --> 1:19:21.580
 you'll concoct a narrative saying rockets are really important for studying penguins

1:19:21.580 --> 1:19:22.380
 in the Antarctic.

1:19:22.380 --> 1:19:22.940
 Right.

1:19:22.940 --> 1:19:29.980
 I think that's actually, this is one thing I think people don't generally understand

1:19:29.980 --> 1:19:35.420
 about the scientific mind is I don't know how capitalistic it is because if it was,

1:19:35.420 --> 1:19:37.500
 they would start an effing company.

1:19:37.500 --> 1:19:38.300
 No, no, no, no.

1:19:38.300 --> 1:19:44.140
 I mean, when I meant capitalist, I didn't mean in the, they'll start companies per se.

1:19:44.140 --> 1:19:47.260
 I mean, we can only do the research where there's money.

1:19:48.060 --> 1:19:53.100
 And so from, you know, maybe it's a bad use of the term capitalist.

1:19:53.100 --> 1:19:57.660
 But we will only do the research where there's money.

1:19:57.660 --> 1:20:03.980
 I mean, why do most people work, many biologists work in cancer?

1:20:03.980 --> 1:20:08.140
 Uh, work in cancer research because there's a lot of money there.

1:20:08.140 --> 1:20:14.620
 It's an important problem, but I might not have ever gotten involved in it if there wasn't

1:20:14.620 --> 1:20:14.940
 money.

1:20:14.940 --> 1:20:20.620
 I might've gone and I was going to be a botanist when I, when I was a kid.

1:20:20.620 --> 1:20:21.580
 That's what I wanted to do.

1:20:22.140 --> 1:20:28.460
 Um, so having money available will bring people to bear.

1:20:28.460 --> 1:20:33.420
 Now, another mistake that's often actually made, I think by the lay public about science

1:20:33.420 --> 1:20:36.620
 is that people think that we're paid to do things.

1:20:36.620 --> 1:20:41.260
 Just as you said, I get a research grant and luckily from the NIH there, they give you

1:20:41.260 --> 1:20:42.540
 a fair amount of latitude.

1:20:43.420 --> 1:20:45.580
 I will go my own way and I'll find something.

1:20:45.580 --> 1:20:50.380
 I might've proposed something, but I'll end up somewhere entirely different by the end

1:20:50.380 --> 1:20:51.500
 of the project.

1:20:51.500 --> 1:20:52.860
 And that's how good science is done.

1:20:52.860 --> 1:20:55.900
 You follow the, you follow the data, you follow the results.

1:20:56.700 --> 1:21:01.580
 Um, and so that's what I'm hoping can be done here.

1:21:01.580 --> 1:21:07.500
 I think the worst kind of thing that could be done with this subject area is to put it

1:21:07.500 --> 1:21:13.180
 inside another company where they have a set plan of what it is they're going to do and

1:21:13.180 --> 1:21:17.020
 the scientists either tell, do what the executives tell them to do or not.

1:21:18.300 --> 1:21:20.380
 That isn't how anything will really get discovered.

1:21:21.100 --> 1:21:27.820
 Put it, get it out into the public, get open minds thinking about it and then publishing

1:21:27.820 --> 1:21:29.900
 on it and doing the right kind of work.

1:21:29.900 --> 1:21:32.700
 That's how real progress will be made with this.

1:21:33.740 --> 1:21:37.340
 Let's again, put our sort of philosophical hats on.

1:21:37.340 --> 1:21:45.660
 Do you think the US government or some other government is in possession of something of

1:21:45.660 --> 1:21:53.260
 extraterrestrial origin that is far more impressive than anything we've seen in the public?

1:21:53.980 --> 1:21:59.180
 If I, I've not seen anything personally, but if I believe the people who I don't think

1:21:59.180 --> 1:22:01.260
 can lie, yes.

1:22:02.540 --> 1:22:07.580
 This is how does that make you feel in terms of the way government works, the way our human

1:22:07.580 --> 1:22:13.580
 civilization works, that there might be things like that and we're not, they're not public.

1:22:13.580 --> 1:22:17.100
 Is, is, is there a hopeful message for transparency that's possible?

1:22:17.100 --> 1:22:22.220
 Like if you were, if you were, uh, in power and I'm not saying president because maybe

1:22:22.220 --> 1:22:25.020
 the president is not the source of power here.

1:22:25.020 --> 1:22:29.100
 Would you release this information in some way or form?

1:22:29.100 --> 1:22:36.060
 Yes, if I were, I think it would, I think it's, I think it's something that can bring

1:22:36.060 --> 1:22:38.300
 humanity together, right?

1:22:38.300 --> 1:22:44.940
 I think that knowledge of this kind of thing to know that we are, you know, we are more

1:22:44.940 --> 1:22:53.260
 alike than we are different in comparison to whatever this is, is, uh, is a positive

1:22:53.260 --> 1:22:55.100
 thing for us.

1:22:55.100 --> 1:23:01.180
 Um, and to know, you know, I don't necessarily care that the government has been hiding it.

1:23:01.180 --> 1:23:05.740
 And I think, you know, people who've been talking about what we should give government

1:23:05.740 --> 1:23:10.380
 officials or whatever amnesty, I think that's probably the right, the right answer.

1:23:10.380 --> 1:23:14.140
 We don't, this isn't a time to look back and say, you did something wrong.

1:23:14.140 --> 1:23:17.340
 You did whatever you did because that was the data you had available to you at the time

1:23:17.340 --> 1:23:19.660
 and those, you had good reasons for doing it.

1:23:19.660 --> 1:23:24.780
 Now, if your reasons were selfish, if your reasons where you wanted to do it because

1:23:24.780 --> 1:23:30.940
 you wanted to monetize it yourself, uh, to the, to your benefit, but against that of

1:23:30.940 --> 1:23:36.140
 others, then I think maybe there's something else that could be said, but you know, an

1:23:36.140 --> 1:23:38.220
 opportunity to get all this information out.

1:23:38.220 --> 1:23:41.900
 If I were in charge, I would, I would try to do it.

1:23:41.900 --> 1:23:46.300
 Now I might be shown something though that says, there's a reason why you don't want

1:23:46.300 --> 1:23:47.340
 to let anybody know this.

1:23:47.340 --> 1:23:50.940
 Maybe you don't want to let anybody know this and maybe you don't want everybody have having

1:23:50.940 --> 1:23:57.900
 access to unlimited, uh, energy because maybe you might turn it into a bomb or something

1:23:57.900 --> 1:24:03.820
 that gives you hints that something like unlimited energy is possible, but you haven't figured

1:24:03.820 --> 1:24:04.820
 it out yet.

1:24:04.820 --> 1:24:10.220
 And if you make it public, maybe some of the other governments you have tensions with we'll

1:24:10.220 --> 1:24:11.220
 figure it out first.

1:24:11.220 --> 1:24:12.220
 Right.

1:24:12.220 --> 1:24:17.180
 I mean, it's kind of an arms race going on, I think in all forms and it's, it makes me

1:24:17.180 --> 1:24:25.020
 truly sad because, uh, it's obvious that, um, for example, the origins of the COVID

1:24:25.020 --> 1:24:32.380
 virus, it's obvious to me that the Chinese government, whatever the origins are, is interested

1:24:32.380 --> 1:24:40.940
 in not releasing information about it because it can only be bad for the Chinese government.

1:24:40.940 --> 1:24:46.300
 And every government thinks like this, like every, actually this has been disappointment

1:24:46.300 --> 1:24:54.460
 to me talking to PR folks at companies, like they're always nervous.

1:24:54.460 --> 1:25:00.780
 They're always like conservative in the sense like, well, if we release more stuff, it can

1:25:00.780 --> 1:25:02.320
 only be bad.

1:25:02.320 --> 1:25:08.540
 And then an Elon Musk character comes along who tweets ridiculous memes and doesn't give

1:25:08.540 --> 1:25:10.660
 a fuck.

1:25:10.660 --> 1:25:15.060
 And I've been encouraging CEOs, I've been encouraging people to be transparent.

1:25:15.060 --> 1:25:20.940
 And of course, government is national security is really like another level as human lives

1:25:20.940 --> 1:25:22.380
 at stake.

1:25:22.380 --> 1:25:28.460
 But let's start at the lighter case of just releasing some of the awesome insides of the

1:25:28.460 --> 1:25:34.340
 tech, how, how the sausages made the technology and being transparent about it because it

1:25:34.340 --> 1:25:36.060
 excites people.

1:25:36.060 --> 1:25:42.780
 It uh, like you said, it, it connects people and inspires them.

1:25:42.780 --> 1:25:44.240
 It's a good for the brand.

1:25:44.240 --> 1:25:45.240
 It's good for everybody.

1:25:45.240 --> 1:25:49.940
 I, I honestly think this kind of idea that people will steal the information and we use

1:25:49.940 --> 1:25:56.780
 it against you is, um, is an idea that's not true in his idea of the 20th century.

1:25:56.780 --> 1:26:02.100
 Like you said, some of the benefits of the social media, uh, our, our social world is

1:26:02.100 --> 1:26:06.860
 that transparency is beneficial and I hope governments will learn that lesson.

1:26:06.860 --> 1:26:10.380
 Of course, they're the, usually the last to learn such lessons.

1:26:10.380 --> 1:26:15.340
 What do you make of Bob Lazar's story in terms of possession of aircraft?

1:26:15.340 --> 1:26:16.340
 Do you believe him?

1:26:16.340 --> 1:26:19.260
 I don't believe in the Bob Lazar story to be quite honest.

1:26:19.260 --> 1:26:28.460
 I mean, I, uh, Jeremy Corbell has done a great job interviewing him and, uh, has done some,

1:26:28.460 --> 1:26:31.700
 you know, beautiful, uh, documentaries.

1:26:31.700 --> 1:26:38.540
 Um, I just don't, I, I don't know how to interpret it.

1:26:38.540 --> 1:26:45.100
 And um, you know, and again, there's some of the people who I fraternize with think

1:26:45.100 --> 1:26:46.100
 it's all rubbish.

1:26:46.100 --> 1:26:49.380
 Uh, yeah, but he, maybe he's right, but I don't know.

1:26:49.380 --> 1:26:55.820
 I mean, the, the problem is, and um, this is a little bit different about how I approach

1:26:55.820 --> 1:26:58.620
 the whole area than a lot of others.

1:26:58.620 --> 1:27:04.980
 I'm less interested in going over old paperwork and all these old histories of who said what,

1:27:04.980 --> 1:27:13.220
 you know, the whole, he said, she said of the history of, of UFOs, I'm a scientist.

1:27:13.220 --> 1:27:18.740
 I worked on the brain area because it's something I can collect data on.

1:27:18.740 --> 1:27:22.900
 I can go back to the same individual, collect their MRI again and redo it.

1:27:22.900 --> 1:27:24.620
 I can hand that MRI to somebody else.

1:27:24.620 --> 1:27:26.020
 They can analyze it.

1:27:26.020 --> 1:27:28.740
 I can get materials, I can analyze them.

1:27:28.740 --> 1:27:30.100
 I can get some of these skeletons.

1:27:30.100 --> 1:27:34.100
 I won't touch any skeletons ever again, but I can analyze it and somebody else can reproduce

1:27:34.100 --> 1:27:35.100
 the data.

1:27:35.100 --> 1:27:36.100
 Yeah.

1:27:36.100 --> 1:27:37.780
 I mean, that's what I'm good at.

1:27:37.780 --> 1:27:43.340
 And so, you know, I'm, I, I, I'm not going to go into the whole, I'm not a historian.

1:27:43.340 --> 1:27:44.480
 Yeah, that's true.

1:27:44.480 --> 1:27:48.060
 But there's a human side to it.

1:27:48.060 --> 1:27:54.300
 I want, sometimes I think with these, because again, anomalous, rare events, some of the

1:27:54.300 --> 1:28:02.620
 data is inextricably connected to humans, the observations, I mean, I hope in the future,

1:28:02.620 --> 1:28:08.740
 you know, that, that, that sensory data will not be polluted by human subjectivity.

1:28:08.740 --> 1:28:14.020
 But you know, that's still, that's still powerful data, even direct observations, like if you

1:28:14.020 --> 1:28:15.020
 talk about pilots.

1:28:15.020 --> 1:28:19.140
 And so it's an interesting question to me, whether Babasar is telling the truth, whether

1:28:19.140 --> 1:28:26.300
 he believes he's telling the truth too, and what also, what impact his story and stories

1:28:26.300 --> 1:28:32.060
 like his have on the willingness of governments to be transparent and so on.

1:28:32.060 --> 1:28:38.700
 So you know, you have to credit his story for captivating the imagination of people

1:28:38.700 --> 1:28:41.120
 and getting the conversation going.

1:28:41.120 --> 1:28:46.100
 He's maintained his story for all these years with little to no change that I'm aware of.

1:28:46.100 --> 1:28:52.820
 So but there's so many other people who are, let's say, experts in that story.

1:28:52.820 --> 1:29:01.620
 Their gut, you know, you accumulate a set of sort of circumstantial evidence where your

1:29:01.620 --> 1:29:04.980
 gut will say that somebody is not telling the truth.

1:29:04.980 --> 1:29:05.980
 Yeah.

1:29:05.980 --> 1:29:11.860
 You mentioned Avi Loeb, I forgot to ask you about Oumuamua.

1:29:11.860 --> 1:29:17.860
 You know, because you've analyzed specimens here on Earth, what do you make of that one?

1:29:17.860 --> 1:29:23.060
 And what do you make broadly of our efforts to look, look at rocks, essentially, or look

1:29:23.060 --> 1:29:28.160
 at objects flying around in our solar system?

1:29:28.160 --> 1:29:34.020
 Is that a valuable pursuit or maybe most of the stories can be, most of the fascinating

1:29:34.020 --> 1:29:37.980
 things could be discovered here on Earth or on other nearby planets?

1:29:37.980 --> 1:29:46.980
 Just going to Oumuamua, you know, I think Avi's insight is an interesting speculation,

1:29:46.980 --> 1:29:48.540
 right?

1:29:48.540 --> 1:29:51.680
 Like I was saying before, people can sometimes look at something and not see it for what

1:29:51.680 --> 1:29:53.860
 it is.

1:29:53.860 --> 1:29:58.220
 Somebody would just look at that and say, oh, it's an asteroid and dismiss it.

1:29:58.220 --> 1:30:03.500
 There was something odd about the data that Avi picked up on and said, well, here's an

1:30:03.500 --> 1:30:08.220
 alternative explanation that doesn't fit, that actually better fits the models than

1:30:08.220 --> 1:30:10.380
 it just being a rock, you know.

1:30:10.380 --> 1:30:17.460
 And to his credit, he just has ignored the critics because he believes the data is real

1:30:17.460 --> 1:30:22.240
 and is using that then as a battering ram to go after other things.

1:30:22.240 --> 1:30:24.660
 And I think that's, I think that's great.

1:30:24.660 --> 1:30:25.660
 You know?

1:30:25.660 --> 1:30:26.660
 Yeah.

1:30:26.660 --> 1:30:27.660
 What, what is his main conclusion?

1:30:27.660 --> 1:30:31.900
 Does he say it could be of alien extraterrestrial origin?

1:30:31.900 --> 1:30:32.900
 Is that his?

1:30:32.900 --> 1:30:33.900
 Well, that's one of the things.

1:30:33.900 --> 1:30:38.500
 I mean, he, you know, he's explained how it could be a light sale.

1:30:38.500 --> 1:30:44.380
 And a light sale is certainly within near human capabilities to make such a thing.

1:30:44.380 --> 1:30:49.060
 I think Yuri Milner, he's a Russian billionaire.

1:30:49.060 --> 1:30:56.700
 He's involved, I think, in a project to make light sales with laser, you know, to, to launch

1:30:56.700 --> 1:31:03.140
 them with laser power, essentially, towards Alpha Centauri, right?

1:31:03.140 --> 1:31:07.700
 So it's something that humans could make.

1:31:07.700 --> 1:31:11.180
 I think Avi's proposal is perfectly within the realm of possibility.

1:31:11.180 --> 1:31:15.700
 I mean, sadly, the thing is, you know, now nearly out of our solar system.

1:31:15.700 --> 1:31:21.980
 Yes, I mean, to me, that's inspiring to do greater levels of data collection in our solar

1:31:21.980 --> 1:31:23.580
 system, but also here on Earth.

1:31:23.580 --> 1:31:28.020
 And it just seems like we should be constantly collecting, collecting data because the tools

1:31:28.020 --> 1:31:31.620
 of software that we're developing get better and better at dealing with huge amounts of

1:31:31.620 --> 1:31:32.620
 data.

1:31:32.620 --> 1:31:37.020
 It's changing the nature of science, I mean, collect all of the data, right?

1:31:37.020 --> 1:31:38.020
 Collect the data.

1:31:38.020 --> 1:31:43.340
 I mean, I, I, the Galileo project asked me over the weekend to join and I did.

1:31:43.340 --> 1:31:48.720
 So you know, I'm not a specialist in any of the stuff that they're doing.

1:31:48.720 --> 1:31:54.020
 But you know, in looking at the list of people who are on there, there are really no biologists

1:31:54.020 --> 1:31:55.020
 on there.

1:31:55.020 --> 1:31:59.140
 So at, at some point, if my expertise is required for something.

1:31:59.140 --> 1:32:01.600
 What's the goal and the vision of the Galileo project?

1:32:01.600 --> 1:32:06.840
 Better talk to Avi, but my understanding and just actually looking at the, at the sort

1:32:06.840 --> 1:32:12.980
 of the bylaws this morning, literally just got them, is number one, collect the data

1:32:12.980 --> 1:32:13.980
 on UAP.

1:32:13.980 --> 1:32:21.660
 And number two, collect data on local, potentially local technological artifacts.

1:32:21.660 --> 1:32:23.460
 I need to look into this.

1:32:23.460 --> 1:32:24.760
 This is fascinating.

1:32:24.760 --> 1:32:27.020
 And Avi is heading the Galileo project.

1:32:27.020 --> 1:32:28.020
 Yeah.

1:32:28.020 --> 1:32:29.020
 Have you spoken to him?

1:32:29.020 --> 1:32:30.020
 On this podcast?

1:32:30.020 --> 1:32:31.020
 Yes.

1:32:31.020 --> 1:32:32.020
 That was before, I believe it was before he was headed.

1:32:32.020 --> 1:32:33.020
 Oh.

1:32:33.020 --> 1:32:34.020
 Is this a new creation?

1:32:34.020 --> 1:32:35.020
 Yeah.

1:32:35.020 --> 1:32:37.700
 The Galileo project was, I think it's about six or seven months old now.

1:32:37.700 --> 1:32:38.700
 Okay.

1:32:38.700 --> 1:32:39.700
 You know.

1:32:39.700 --> 1:32:40.700
 That's amazing.

1:32:40.700 --> 1:32:41.700
 And he's getting a group of scientists together.

1:32:41.700 --> 1:32:42.700
 Oh yeah.

1:32:42.700 --> 1:32:43.700
 That's awesome.

1:32:43.700 --> 1:32:47.740
 Actually, I am, I was looking at some of their stuff over the weekend.

1:32:47.740 --> 1:32:50.940
 I'm shocked at the level of organization that they've already got put together.

1:32:50.940 --> 1:32:51.940
 That's amazing.

1:32:51.940 --> 1:32:53.620
 It looks like a moonshot project.

1:32:53.620 --> 1:32:59.040
 I mean, I've been involved with a lot of NIH, large NIH projects, which involve a lot of

1:32:59.040 --> 1:33:06.120
 people in coordination and they're putting it together.

1:33:06.120 --> 1:33:17.100
 So you're extremely well published in a lot of the fields we began this conversation with.

1:33:17.100 --> 1:33:27.820
 So you're a legit scientist, but yet you're keeping an open mind to a lot of ideas that

1:33:27.820 --> 1:33:33.160
 maybe require you to take a leap outside of the conventional.

1:33:33.160 --> 1:33:40.420
 So what advice would you give to young people today that are in high school or in college

1:33:40.420 --> 1:33:47.720
 that are dreaming of having impact in science or maybe in whatever career path that goes

1:33:47.720 --> 1:33:53.560
 outside of the conventional that really does something new?

1:33:53.560 --> 1:34:01.620
 If you believe in something, you believe that an idea is valuable or you haven't approached

1:34:01.620 --> 1:34:06.740
 something, don't let others shame you into not doing it.

1:34:06.740 --> 1:34:12.840
 As I've said, shame is a societal control device to get other people to do what they

1:34:12.840 --> 1:34:16.620
 want you to do rather than what you want to do.

1:34:16.620 --> 1:34:21.660
 So shame sometimes is good to stop you from doing something unethical or wrong, but shame

1:34:21.660 --> 1:34:27.100
 also is something that is circumscribing your environment.

1:34:27.100 --> 1:34:33.220
 I've never let people who've told me, you shouldn't do that line of science, you should

1:34:33.220 --> 1:34:38.020
 be ashamed of yourself for even thinking that, give me a break.

1:34:38.020 --> 1:34:41.340
 Why is it wrong to ask questions about this area?

1:34:41.340 --> 1:34:43.380
 What's wrong with asking the question?

1:34:43.380 --> 1:34:48.940
 Frankly, you're the person who's wrong for trying to stop these questions.

1:34:48.940 --> 1:34:53.080
 You're the person who's almost acting like a cultist.

1:34:53.080 --> 1:34:58.580
 You basically have closed your mind to what the possibilities are, and if I'm not hurting

1:34:58.580 --> 1:35:04.900
 anybody, and if it could lead to an advance, and if it's my time, why does it bother you?

1:35:04.900 --> 1:35:10.000
 I had a very well known scientist once tell me that I was going to hurt my career talking

1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:11.260
 about this.

1:35:11.260 --> 1:35:13.220
 If anything, it's enhanced my career.

1:35:13.220 --> 1:35:15.160
 I have a couple of questions on this.

1:35:15.160 --> 1:35:18.400
 So first of all, just a small comment on that.

1:35:18.400 --> 1:35:24.700
 I've realized that it feels like a lot of the progress in science is done by people

1:35:24.700 --> 1:35:29.900
 pursuing an idea that another senior faculty would probably say, this is going to hurt

1:35:29.900 --> 1:35:30.900
 your career.

1:35:30.900 --> 1:35:36.100
 I think it's actually a pretty good indicator that there's something interesting when a

1:35:36.100 --> 1:35:40.620
 senior wise person tells you this is going to hurt your career.

1:35:40.620 --> 1:35:45.420
 I think that's just the one, as a small, if I were to give advice to young people, if

1:35:45.420 --> 1:35:49.580
 somebody senior tells you this is going to hurt your career, think twice about taking

1:35:49.580 --> 1:35:50.580
 their advice.

1:35:50.580 --> 1:35:51.580
 Yeah.

1:35:51.580 --> 1:35:54.580
 I mean, I think that's the primary thing.

1:35:54.580 --> 1:36:00.140
 And the other, I tell my own students, I have a lab of about 20, 30 people and it's been

1:36:00.140 --> 1:36:03.500
 that big since 1992.

1:36:03.500 --> 1:36:06.660
 People come and go.

1:36:06.660 --> 1:36:14.020
 It's not the data that falls in line that's so interesting.

1:36:14.020 --> 1:36:21.580
 It's the spot off the graph that you want to understand.

1:36:21.580 --> 1:36:26.060
 When something is way off the graph, that's the interesting thing because that's usually

1:36:26.060 --> 1:36:28.500
 where discovery is.

1:36:28.500 --> 1:36:32.220
 And the number of times that I've stopped people in my lab and said, wait a second,

1:36:32.220 --> 1:36:34.000
 go back a few slides.

1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:35.820
 What was that?

1:36:35.820 --> 1:36:42.580
 And then it ended up being something interesting that made their careers, I could count on

1:36:42.580 --> 1:36:44.140
 a few hands.

1:36:44.140 --> 1:36:45.140
 Yeah.

1:36:45.140 --> 1:36:53.060
 Get excited by the extraordinary that's outside of the thing that you've done in the past.

1:36:53.060 --> 1:37:01.780
 Just on a personal psychological level, is there, I'm sure at Stanford, I'm sure in you

1:37:01.780 --> 1:37:05.020
 exploring some of these ideas, there's pressure.

1:37:05.020 --> 1:37:09.820
 How do you not give in to the pressure?

1:37:09.820 --> 1:37:17.980
 How do you not give in to the people that push you away from these topics?

1:37:17.980 --> 1:37:19.460
 What would you say is shame?

1:37:19.460 --> 1:37:22.060
 I just point to my successes.

1:37:22.060 --> 1:37:28.520
 I say, you're the ones who told me not to start companies all this time ago.

1:37:28.520 --> 1:37:34.900
 And now you're the one coming to me for advice for how to start a company.

1:37:34.900 --> 1:37:43.000
 But from the scientific area, it's you're wanting to take something off the table that

1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:47.740
 might be an explanation.

1:37:47.740 --> 1:37:50.860
 How is that the scientific method?

1:37:50.860 --> 1:37:54.220
 I reverse shame them.

1:37:54.220 --> 1:37:56.860
 So purely with reason through conversation, you're able to do that.

1:37:56.860 --> 1:37:59.700
 So it doesn't feel, because to me it would just feel lonely.

1:37:59.700 --> 1:38:01.540
 There's a community.

1:38:01.540 --> 1:38:08.700
 There's a community of science, and when you're working on something that's outside a particular

1:38:08.700 --> 1:38:12.180
 conventional way of thinking, it can be lonely.

1:38:12.180 --> 1:38:17.620
 There's in the AI field, if you were working on neural networks in the 90s, it could be

1:38:17.620 --> 1:38:18.700
 lonely.

1:38:18.700 --> 1:38:23.820
 I have met some of the most fascinating people ever that had I stayed the conventional track,

1:38:23.820 --> 1:38:26.260
 I would never have met.

1:38:26.260 --> 1:38:31.160
 Truly brilliant people because of this.

1:38:31.160 --> 1:38:40.460
 So it is for those worried about, well, should I step outside of my comfort zone?

1:38:40.460 --> 1:38:42.900
 You're going to meet some really interesting people.

1:38:42.900 --> 1:38:51.860
 And because I'm open about this area, I'll go and give a talk in Boston, Harvard or MIT.

1:38:51.860 --> 1:38:57.140
 And at dinner, inevitably, this subject comes up.

1:38:57.140 --> 1:39:01.460
 And inevitably somebody else at the table will admit both that they're interested or

1:39:01.460 --> 1:39:03.520
 that they've seen something.

1:39:03.520 --> 1:39:07.020
 And suddenly the whole tone of the conversation changes.

1:39:07.020 --> 1:39:13.380
 It's kind of like there's safety in numbers and then, or I've had people come to me afterwards

1:39:13.380 --> 1:39:19.420
 after dinner and say, Hey, I don't talk about this openly, but.

1:39:19.420 --> 1:39:27.660
 So the number of scientists who know that there's something else going on is much larger

1:39:27.660 --> 1:39:32.220
 than the scientific community would like to think.

1:39:32.220 --> 1:39:38.220
 That's a really powerful one, which is, I don't talk about this openly, but here's what

1:39:38.220 --> 1:39:40.240
 I believe.

1:39:40.240 --> 1:39:44.780
 And you'd be surprised how many people speak like this and hold those beliefs.

1:39:44.780 --> 1:39:50.260
 And I am optimistic about social media and a more connected world to reveal more and

1:39:50.260 --> 1:39:56.100
 more, like us not to have these two personalities, we're like this public and private one.

1:39:56.100 --> 1:39:59.140
 We've mentioned the big questions of the origins of the universe.

1:39:59.140 --> 1:40:06.700
 What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing for us humans, our human existence here

1:40:06.700 --> 1:40:10.940
 on earth, or just at the individual level of a human life?

1:40:10.940 --> 1:40:15.820
 What Gary is the meaning of life.

1:40:15.820 --> 1:40:25.300
 I think that what we're going through today with this realization, it's kind of like you've

1:40:25.300 --> 1:40:32.420
 lived on an island your whole life and you've looked across the ocean and you've never imagined

1:40:32.420 --> 1:40:35.380
 there was another island with anybody else on it.

1:40:35.380 --> 1:40:39.980
 And then suddenly a ship with sails shows up.

1:40:39.980 --> 1:40:45.740
 You don't understand it, but you realize that suddenly your world just got a lot bigger.

1:40:45.740 --> 1:40:52.960
 I think we're in one of those moments right now that our world view, our galactic view

1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:55.940
 is opening to something a little bit bigger.

1:40:55.940 --> 1:41:03.760
 And not just that there might be somebody else, but that there's something else.

1:41:03.760 --> 1:41:06.940
 And what it is, is yet to be understood.

1:41:06.940 --> 1:41:13.660
 And the fact that it isn't understood to me is what's exciting because I can fill it with

1:41:13.660 --> 1:41:16.300
 my dreams.

1:41:16.300 --> 1:41:25.580
 And this discovery our world might is about to get a lot more humbling and a lot more

1:41:25.580 --> 1:41:30.620
 fascinating once we look out and realize we were on an island all along.

1:41:30.620 --> 1:41:34.780
 It makes us both smaller but larger at the same time to me.

1:41:34.780 --> 1:41:42.140
 You know, I can look outside at the stars and think and imagine what else might be out

1:41:42.140 --> 1:41:43.140
 there.

1:41:43.140 --> 1:41:50.300
 And although I know that I will never see it all, it excites me to know that it's there.

1:41:50.300 --> 1:41:58.740
 Well Gary, both to respect your time and also because at 12 I turned into a princess, let

1:41:58.740 --> 1:42:05.700
 me just say thank you for doing everything you're doing as a great scientist, as a person

1:42:05.700 --> 1:42:10.780
 willing to reject the conventional, and thank you for spending your extremely valuable time

1:42:10.780 --> 1:42:11.780
 with me today.

1:42:11.780 --> 1:42:12.780
 Thanks for talking.

1:42:12.780 --> 1:42:13.780
 Thanks so much.

1:42:13.780 --> 1:42:15.060
 It was great talking.

1:42:15.060 --> 1:42:17.300
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Gary Nolan.

1:42:17.300 --> 1:42:21.620
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

1:42:21.620 --> 1:42:27.460
 And now let me leave you with some words from Stanislav Lem in Solaris.

1:42:27.460 --> 1:42:34.860
 How do you expect to communicate with the ocean when we can't even understand one another?

1:42:34.860 --> 1:42:58.380
 Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.
