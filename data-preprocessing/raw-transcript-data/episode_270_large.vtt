00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
 The following is a conversation with Rabbi David Wolpe, someone who I have been a fan

00:05.040 --> 00:10.240
 of for many years, for the kindness in his heart, the strength of his character, and

00:10.240 --> 00:15.280
 the kind of friends he keeps and talks with, many of whom disagree with him but love him

00:15.280 --> 00:20.440
 nevertheless, including the late Christopher Hitchens.

00:20.440 --> 00:25.840
 I will have many conversations like these in the future about religion, about Islam,

00:25.840 --> 00:31.320
 Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and others, looking to understand and celebrate

00:31.320 --> 00:36.600
 the culture, the tradition, and the beauty of the people who practice these religions.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.840
 I will of course not shy away from the difficult topics.

00:39.840 --> 00:46.400
 I will talk both about hate and love, about war and peace.

00:46.400 --> 00:50.080
 This conversation was recorded more than three weeks ago.

00:50.080 --> 00:54.640
 Please allow me this time to speak on what has been on my mind.

00:54.640 --> 01:00.000
 If this is not interesting to you, please skip, I totally understand.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.320
 Some people asked me to say a few words on the war in Ukraine.

01:04.320 --> 01:09.820
 I think my words are worth little, but perhaps let me try.

01:09.820 --> 01:13.320
 I considered doing a long solo episode on this war.

01:13.320 --> 01:18.120
 I tried several times, but it is too personal for now.

01:18.120 --> 01:23.680
 To give you context, I've been talking to refugees, friends, loved ones, in Ukraine,

01:23.680 --> 01:30.520
 in Russia, in Poland, Slovakia, Moldova, Romania, even UK, Germany, Canada, India, China, and

01:30.520 --> 01:33.720
 of course the United States.

01:33.720 --> 01:40.560
 Some of them crying, or angry, or confused, or scared.

01:40.560 --> 01:46.060
 I'm helping as best as I can privately, and I'm hoping to help in the future by traveling

01:46.060 --> 01:51.640
 to Ukraine and Russia and celebrating the humanity and the beauty of the people in this

01:51.640 --> 01:53.060
 region.

01:53.060 --> 01:59.640
 This was all set up both for Ukraine and Russia trips before 2022, including conversations

01:59.640 --> 02:07.880
 with scientists, artists, athletes, leaders, and just, quote, regular folks, who are equally

02:07.880 --> 02:10.560
 if not more fascinating to me.

02:10.560 --> 02:16.400
 For now, it has become much more difficult, but I'll keep trying to find a way.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.680
 I was born in the Soviet Union.

02:18.680 --> 02:22.040
 My roots are both Ukrainian and Russian.

02:22.040 --> 02:26.920
 From today and until the day I die, I am an American.

02:26.920 --> 02:29.240
 I'm proud of all of this.

02:29.240 --> 02:33.120
 I hope to keep celebrating the culture and the incredible human beings that make up these

02:33.120 --> 02:36.300
 nations and humanity as a whole.

02:36.300 --> 02:37.300
 We're all one people.

02:37.300 --> 02:38.880
 We're in this together.

02:38.880 --> 02:42.480
 That's how I feel about the people of these nations.

02:42.480 --> 02:47.640
 Now let me speak about those in the seats of power.

02:47.640 --> 02:53.880
 I condemn all actions of leaders who play geopolitical games on the world stage disregarding

02:53.880 --> 02:59.240
 the costs paid in human suffering on the scale of millions.

02:59.240 --> 03:05.200
 For this reason, I condemn Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

03:05.200 --> 03:11.680
 And I condemn many of the military interventions by the superpowers of the world, including

03:11.680 --> 03:19.000
 by my country, the country I love, the United States, that after World War II has intervened

03:19.000 --> 03:24.780
 in over 40 nations with many studies finding that the United States is culpable for an

03:24.780 --> 03:28.480
 unfathomable number of civilian deaths.

03:28.480 --> 03:35.320
 I condemn all heads of state who needlessly wage wars, watching young men and women burn

03:35.320 --> 03:37.680
 in the fires they started.

03:37.680 --> 03:43.360
 I don't understand how humans can be so cruel to each other, or rather I understand, but

03:43.360 --> 03:47.600
 I believe in a future world where this is no longer true.

03:47.600 --> 03:53.080
 Let me also say a few words of what I hope to do with this podcast.

03:53.080 --> 03:56.960
 I want to explore the full complexity and beauty of human nature.

03:56.960 --> 04:02.780
 I believe each of us are capable of good and evil, and I want to understand how the mind

04:02.780 --> 04:08.600
 and the circumstance lead one to choose the former path or the latter.

04:08.600 --> 04:13.380
 And I believe conversation is one of the best ways to work toward this understanding.

04:13.380 --> 04:18.200
 For that, I think I have to not only talk to the most inspiring humans in the world,

04:18.200 --> 04:20.840
 but also to the most controversial.

04:20.840 --> 04:26.960
 I will speak with many people who I disagree with, politicians, activists, CEOs, heads

04:26.960 --> 04:31.160
 of state, with very different opinions on the world.

04:31.160 --> 04:37.040
 I will try hard to challenge their ideas without closing my mind to the depth and complexity

04:37.040 --> 04:40.980
 of their perspective and their humanity.

04:40.980 --> 04:46.640
 My presence in the same room with wildly different people will make it easy for the media and

04:46.640 --> 04:51.920
 the internet to pick and choose clips and snapshots attacking me for being a shill for

04:51.920 --> 04:54.080
 one side or the other.

04:54.080 --> 04:59.360
 I can't defend this point, except to say that I'm a shill for no one, and that I

04:59.360 --> 05:04.120
 hope you see the strength of my integrity, that I won't be influenced by any of them

05:04.120 --> 05:08.560
 no matter how rich, powerful, or charismatic they are.

05:08.560 --> 05:14.960
 Like the poem If by Roger Kipling says, if you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,

05:14.960 --> 05:20.240
 or walk with kings, nor lose the common touch, if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt

05:20.240 --> 05:25.660
 you, if all men count with you, but none too much.

05:25.660 --> 05:30.980
 This is a really, really important thing to me that I try to live by, that all human beings

05:30.980 --> 05:32.920
 count with me the same.

05:32.920 --> 05:36.920
 People have criticized me for wanting to have some of these conversations, like with Vladimir

05:36.920 --> 05:43.340
 Putin and Vladimir Zelensky, and for times in the past speaking about them without the

05:43.340 --> 05:45.640
 seriousness the topic deserves.

05:45.640 --> 05:49.360
 For this, I would sincerely like to apologize.

05:49.360 --> 05:54.200
 I'm disappointed, even ashamed, of my frequent ineloquence on these topics.

05:54.200 --> 05:57.100
 I will work hard to do better.

05:57.100 --> 06:02.880
 When I'm joking, it should be clear that it's a joke, and hopefully actually funny.

06:02.880 --> 06:07.320
 When I'm being serious, I should speak with care and rigor.

06:07.320 --> 06:11.000
 I've now done many hundreds of hours of podcast conversation.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.440
 Despite my frequent failures in speaking, I hope you know where my heart is.

06:15.440 --> 06:20.220
 Unfortunately, I think people will take clips of me and use them to attack me.

06:20.220 --> 06:21.880
 This will happen more and more.

06:21.880 --> 06:26.600
 I guess there's nothing I can do but send them my love, and in the meantime, try to

06:26.600 --> 06:29.160
 be a better person and a better interviewer.

06:29.160 --> 06:34.760
 Let me also say that I like humor, especially dark humor.

06:34.760 --> 06:38.040
 I like being silly and not taking myself seriously.

06:38.040 --> 06:44.180
 I will keep taking risks with that, all with the goal of having fun and celebrating humanity

06:44.180 --> 06:46.960
 at its most absurd and most beautiful.

06:46.960 --> 06:52.720
 I will occasionally dress up in strange and weird outfits to celebrate the absurdity of

06:52.720 --> 06:53.720
 life.

06:53.720 --> 06:57.440
 I will hang out, break bread, and joke with all kinds of people.

06:57.440 --> 07:01.520
 I don't have to agree with them to laugh with them, in order to escape for a brief

07:01.520 --> 07:05.480
 moment the tension, the conflict, the hatred in the world.

07:05.480 --> 07:10.840
 Humor just might save this little chaotic little civilization of ours.

07:10.840 --> 07:12.980
 I love the Ukrainian people.

07:12.980 --> 07:15.080
 I love the Russian people.

07:15.080 --> 07:21.320
 And of course, I love my fellow Americans, Californians and Midwesterners, New Yorkers

07:21.320 --> 07:22.600
 and Texans.

07:22.600 --> 07:23.880
 I love humans.

07:23.880 --> 07:24.880
 I love life.

07:24.880 --> 07:28.040
 And I want to share that love with others.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.040
 With you.

07:29.040 --> 07:32.040
 If I mess it up, I'm really, really sorry.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.040
 I'm trying my best.

07:33.040 --> 07:36.160
 I have no agenda and no one telling me what to do.

07:36.160 --> 07:40.480
 I feel like the luckiest guy in the world to have all these opportunities, and I'm

07:40.480 --> 07:46.560
 deeply grateful to be alive and to share that joy with other amazing people around me.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.040
 Thank you for your support.

07:48.040 --> 07:53.120
 For all the love you've sent my way, I will work my ass off to not disappoint you.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.520
 I love you all.

07:55.520 --> 07:57.600
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

07:57.600 --> 08:01.080
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

08:01.080 --> 08:06.080
 And now, here's my conversation with David Welby.

08:06.080 --> 08:07.760
 Let's start with a big question.

08:07.760 --> 08:10.820
 According to Judaism, who is God?

08:10.820 --> 08:17.880
 It's difficult because Judaism, like any tradition that is thousands of years old and encompasses

08:17.880 --> 08:23.460
 so many different lands and languages and thinkers, it doesn't give a single answer

08:23.460 --> 08:25.160
 to even simple questions.

08:25.160 --> 08:28.400
 And to large questions, it certainly doesn't give a single answer.

08:28.400 --> 08:33.400
 Although Judaism was responsible for introducing the monotheistic idea to the world, it doesn't

08:33.400 --> 08:35.600
 mean that it's one idea.

08:35.600 --> 08:43.040
 So if you take Maimonides, the greatest sage in the Jewish tradition, a medieval philosopher,

08:43.040 --> 08:49.280
 he would say that God is an omnipotent, benevolent, intangible, unimaginable God.

08:49.280 --> 08:53.900
 In fact, he said, you can't say what God is, only what God is not, because you have

08:53.900 --> 08:59.200
 to emphasize, could talk more about that, but basically you have to emphasize the unknowability

08:59.200 --> 09:00.840
 of God.

09:00.840 --> 09:05.040
 You have a modern philosopher like Heschel, who says that God is a God of pathos, a God

09:05.040 --> 09:12.880
 of deep feeling, which probably would make Maimonides shiver if he heard such a description.

09:12.880 --> 09:19.080
 And if you look in the Bible, God is always regretting or having human emotions.

09:19.080 --> 09:24.720
 So there are so many different kinds of depictions and ideas, and there is this tremendous tension

09:24.720 --> 09:27.960
 between transcendence and imminence.

09:27.960 --> 09:33.920
 That is, in the Jewish tradition, God is exquisitely close, God is imminent.

09:33.920 --> 09:38.600
 In the Talmud's words, God is as close as your mouth is to your ear.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.880
 In other words, whatever you say, God hears it.

09:40.880 --> 09:45.500
 And yet at the same time, God is unfathomably distant.

09:45.500 --> 09:50.420
 Sometimes when I speak to high schoolers, I will say, in the Jewish tradition, think

09:50.420 --> 09:52.140
 of it this way.

09:52.140 --> 09:56.500
 When you were two years old, you had no idea what it was to be a 15 year old.

09:56.500 --> 10:02.280
 Not only did you not know, but you didn't know what you didn't know.

10:02.280 --> 10:07.120
 We conceive of God as being more, the distance between God and human beings is far greater

10:07.120 --> 10:10.080
 than the distance between a two year old and a 15 year old.

10:10.080 --> 10:15.300
 So when we speak about God, we have to acknowledge how limited we really are.

10:15.300 --> 10:18.240
 So okay, you laid out a lot of fascinating things on the table.

10:18.240 --> 10:27.440
 So one, the nobility of God, then this idea of deep feeling, which again, can God operate

10:27.440 --> 10:33.480
 in the space of feelings too, so not just the mouth and the ear of the senses, can God

10:33.480 --> 10:35.480
 be known?

10:35.480 --> 10:44.240
 Can God be felt by this three year old in the analogy versus the teenager?

10:44.240 --> 10:49.200
 So I will take refuge in a beautiful phrase from Martin Buber, another Jewish theologian.

10:49.200 --> 10:53.000
 He said, God cannot be expressed, God can only be addressed.

10:53.000 --> 10:59.080
 In other words, you can speak to God, you can feel a sense of God, but can you begin

10:59.080 --> 11:01.240
 to comprehend or know God?

11:01.240 --> 11:02.240
 No.

11:02.240 --> 11:07.800
 Yosef Kaspi, I'm pulling in a couple of early Jewish philosophers, he said, to know God,

11:07.800 --> 11:08.800
 I would have to be God.

11:08.800 --> 11:12.120
 But can we get close?

11:12.120 --> 11:20.720
 Is it useful or is it a distraction to visualize things, to embody, to create, to attach to

11:20.720 --> 11:24.800
 the stories some kind of visualizations in our mind?

11:24.800 --> 11:31.520
 For example, gender, he versus she, things like this, or old man in the sky kind of feeling.

11:31.520 --> 11:36.440
 So it's almost inevitable, but I think ultimately you try to transcend it.

11:36.440 --> 11:43.160
 This was the great, we just read this actually in synagogue, the story of the golden calf.

11:43.160 --> 11:51.800
 And the story is that human beings found it impossible to not have a visualization because

11:51.800 --> 11:58.080
 they had just come from Egypt and in the world of pagan worship, everything is...

11:58.080 --> 12:02.700
 It's not that pagans thought that idol was actually God, but it represented visually

12:02.700 --> 12:04.560
 what God was.

12:04.560 --> 12:11.120
 And along comes this idea that God is actually not capable of being visualized, which is

12:11.120 --> 12:17.360
 very difficult and it stretches the bounds of human comprehension, maybe even breaks

12:17.360 --> 12:18.360
 them.

12:18.360 --> 12:26.120
 So would you say that the proper way to operate as a human in relation to God is humility

12:26.120 --> 12:31.640
 in that you're screwed, you're not able to basically know anything, almost anything?

12:31.640 --> 12:39.920
 Well, the reason that the salvation of this is that you can't, I was going to say the

12:39.920 --> 12:43.360
 reason you're not screwed, but then I thought somebody might be upset at a rabbi saying

12:43.360 --> 12:44.360
 that.

12:44.360 --> 12:47.640
 So I didn't say it and have not said it.

12:47.640 --> 12:55.240
 But the reason you're not is that you don't have to have a comprehension of God.

12:55.240 --> 12:59.200
 You have to have a relationship to God and those are not the same.

12:59.200 --> 13:06.600
 I mean, to draw an analogy that is not far from perfect as most analogies are, but this

13:06.600 --> 13:10.480
 one especially, you have relationships with people who are mysteries to you.

13:10.480 --> 13:13.500
 You're a mystery to yourself.

13:13.500 --> 13:17.480
 You can live and love somebody for 50 years and they can say something that surprises

13:17.480 --> 13:21.720
 you because ultimately we are trapped in here.

13:21.720 --> 13:25.680
 And when a child first says I, we call that individuation.

13:25.680 --> 13:33.800
 But what that really means is I now know that I am cut off from the minds of all other children

13:33.800 --> 13:36.000
 and all other people.

13:36.000 --> 13:45.640
 And so you have with God a more intimate relationship because you can believe that God is, you are

13:45.640 --> 13:50.120
 known by God and you have a relationship to God despite the fact that you can't know

13:50.120 --> 13:52.740
 God just as you can't know others.

13:52.740 --> 13:57.240
 And some would say to have a good relationship, you want to be constantly surprised.

13:57.240 --> 13:58.240
 Right.

13:58.240 --> 13:59.240
 You don't want to know the thing.

13:59.240 --> 14:02.440
 Well, the world, yes, the world that God created is constantly surprising.

14:02.440 --> 14:06.640
 And by the way, the caveat to this, you know, when I had all these debates with Christopher

14:06.640 --> 14:10.840
 Hitchens and he would always say that God is a greater tyrant than North Korea because

14:10.840 --> 14:13.000
 it continues after your death.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.560
 And the idea of being known by God is after all frightening if you think God knows what

14:17.560 --> 14:22.400
 I think and so on, if your image of God is unloving.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.900
 Can we jump to this?

14:23.900 --> 14:28.800
 You had friendships and conversations with a lot of the fascinating figures of the past

14:28.800 --> 14:36.120
 20, 30 years of the great intellectuals, one of which perhaps one of the greats is Christopher

14:36.120 --> 14:37.240
 Hitchens.

14:37.240 --> 14:42.320
 What have you learned from your conversation, your friendship?

14:42.320 --> 14:47.560
 So there are a lot of views he held that I really did not agree with, but he was a remarkable

14:47.560 --> 14:48.560
 person.

14:48.560 --> 14:49.560
 That was a good line about North Korea.

14:49.560 --> 14:51.280
 He was full of incredibly good lines.

14:51.280 --> 14:54.440
 Well, one of the things I learned was you can't win a debate with Christopher Hitchens.

14:54.440 --> 14:59.760
 One of the reasons you can't win is because he has this British baritone and this ready

14:59.760 --> 15:06.480
 wit that you can't triumph over laughter.

15:06.480 --> 15:10.120
 It doesn't matter if your argument is better, if your quip is better, you win.

15:10.120 --> 15:14.960
 And so I remember once we were arguing about free will and he said, well, I choose to believe

15:14.960 --> 15:15.960
 in it.

15:15.960 --> 15:20.080
 And everybody laughed and that was despite the fact that that's not really an argument.

15:20.080 --> 15:24.320
 Or like I have free will because I don't have a choice or whatever.

15:24.320 --> 15:25.320
 Exactly.

15:25.320 --> 15:26.520
 And people should watch your conversation with him.

15:26.520 --> 15:27.520
 It's great.

15:27.520 --> 15:35.160
 I mean, it's a kind of David versus Goliath situation and you're quite masterful at using

15:35.160 --> 15:37.520
 charisma and sweet talking Christopher Hitchens.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.640
 I also genuinely liked him.

15:39.640 --> 15:47.680
 I mean, I spent a three hour limousine ride with him from one debate to another, from

15:47.680 --> 15:49.880
 LA to San Diego.

15:49.880 --> 15:53.600
 And the entire time he said, we just can't talk about religion.

15:53.600 --> 15:59.160
 So we talked about literature and he gave me a long lecture about scotch.

15:59.160 --> 16:02.040
 He was inexhaustible.

16:02.040 --> 16:06.640
 I mean, not only did he, I began, I wrote a couple of obituaries about him and one I

16:06.640 --> 16:12.880
 began with the historian Keith Thomas said, there are two ways of achieving immortality

16:12.880 --> 16:16.300
 by doing things worth remembering or saying things worth remembering.

16:16.300 --> 16:17.960
 And by that standard, he did both.

16:17.960 --> 16:21.540
 I mean, he went all around the world to all sorts of danger zones.

16:21.540 --> 16:28.280
 He knew like the best bars everywhere from Kuala Lumpur, you know, to Beirut, to LA.

16:28.280 --> 16:35.400
 And he could drink all night and write a 2000 word essay on the poetry of Yates and go to

16:35.400 --> 16:36.400
 sleep.

16:36.400 --> 16:41.320
 I remember before one of our debates in Boston, he was at the bar and he said, come have a

16:41.320 --> 16:42.320
 drink.

16:42.320 --> 16:44.960
 And I said, I'm not going to have a drink before I go to debate with you.

16:44.960 --> 16:45.960
 What are you crazy?

16:45.960 --> 16:49.520
 And he said, just have a beer, it's water.

16:49.520 --> 16:59.000
 So he was, he really was a constant, inexhaustible fountain of intrigue and interest.

16:59.000 --> 17:04.160
 What kind of things, if you can remember, if you can mention, if you can admit, to have

17:04.160 --> 17:10.000
 him enlightening you or helping you change your mind about something in this world.

17:10.000 --> 17:15.280
 So I think, unrelated to Scotch, yeah, unrelated to Scotch.

17:15.280 --> 17:23.720
 He convinced me that the idea, I mean, I had my doubts about it and have my doubts about

17:23.720 --> 17:27.680
 it, but he convinced me through many debates and not only he, that the idea that religion

17:27.680 --> 17:36.080
 makes people better is not, it's not ipso facto wrong, but it's a much, much more complicated

17:36.080 --> 17:39.760
 argument than I wished it to be.

17:39.760 --> 17:47.440
 So he is, however you conceive of the term beauty, he's one of those, one of the more

17:47.440 --> 17:53.340
 beautiful humans, this weird little earth produced.

17:53.340 --> 18:00.460
 So how do you explain the atheism combined with such a beautiful mind?

18:00.460 --> 18:07.880
 So from your perspective of a man of faith, how do you think about that?

18:07.880 --> 18:17.200
 So of the atheists that I have debated, I think about all of them somewhat differently.

18:17.200 --> 18:22.960
 So I think that in some deep way, for example, Sam Harris is a religious personality.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.780
 I don't even think that he would, he wouldn't like the word religious, but I don't even

18:25.780 --> 18:29.080
 think that he would take issue with that.

18:29.080 --> 18:34.000
 I think that he would say his is a purely material based spirituality.

18:34.000 --> 18:39.840
 But I mean, his orientation towards meditation and appreciation of Buddhism, there's something

18:39.840 --> 18:44.320
 deeply seeking spiritual about him.

18:44.320 --> 18:51.520
 With Hitchens, I honestly, and I know that some of his fans will really not like this.

18:51.520 --> 18:57.280
 It's not that he was any kind of closet believer, certainly not at all, but I almost feel as

18:57.280 --> 19:04.920
 though he was less a passionate arguer against religion than he was, first of all, extremely

19:04.920 --> 19:08.600
 upset by the forms that religion took in this world.

19:08.600 --> 19:15.120
 And then once he trained his intellectual howitzers on a target, he had so much fun

19:15.120 --> 19:23.520
 inventing new arguments and attacking it that I really believe he gets carried away sometimes

19:23.520 --> 19:28.940
 by his own eloquence and intellectual range.

19:28.940 --> 19:34.140
 So for example, the idea that you would call a book that religion poisons everything, I

19:34.140 --> 19:38.600
 think he did that deliberately provocatively so that he could defend a proposition that

19:38.600 --> 19:42.560
 obviously is indefensible, that it poisons everything.

19:42.560 --> 19:48.040
 So I don't know, I think he had tremendous joie de vivre.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.840
 That's really what, that's what sums him up.

19:49.840 --> 19:56.440
 This guy loved life in all of its manifestations and arguing against something that someone

19:56.440 --> 19:58.840
 else believed was one of his greatest joys.

19:58.840 --> 20:03.640
 Yeah, and of course the practical aspect of that, he just saw the powerful and he challenged

20:03.640 --> 20:05.160
 them with humor and so on.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.160
 Absolutely.

20:06.160 --> 20:10.840
 And you know, you could argue perhaps that humor is the highest form of what humanity

20:10.840 --> 20:11.840
 can achieve.

20:11.840 --> 20:16.640
 Like sometimes maybe us little humans take things a little too seriously, then sometimes

20:16.640 --> 20:20.600
 we need to just laugh at it all, laugh at ourselves, and that's probably the purest

20:20.600 --> 20:21.600
 form of wisdom.

20:21.600 --> 20:26.600
 You know, Auden, the poet, said, among the people that I like or admire, I can find no

20:26.600 --> 20:29.600
 common quality, but among those I love, I can.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.480
 All of them make me laugh.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.480
 There you have it.

20:32.480 --> 20:33.480
 Yeah.

20:33.480 --> 20:38.480
 Speaking of people that make you laugh, Sam Harris, because he actually has a really great

20:38.480 --> 20:39.480
 sense of humor.

20:39.480 --> 20:40.480
 He does.

20:40.480 --> 20:43.160
 With a very cold and monotone delivery.

20:43.160 --> 20:51.080
 He's another one that you had, you're friends with, you have good conversations with.

20:51.080 --> 20:54.240
 What's your fundamental disagreements and agreements with Sam?

20:54.240 --> 20:58.440
 Sam believes that religion is intellectually indefensible.

20:58.440 --> 21:03.240
 He really believes it, like deep in his soul.

21:03.240 --> 21:11.920
 And he gets angry at the idea that a proposition should be unchallenged if it offends his sense

21:11.920 --> 21:13.800
 of logic.

21:13.800 --> 21:16.360
 So he cannot move on until this is dealt with.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.360
 Nope.

21:17.360 --> 21:23.520
 In fact, I did a podcast with Eric Weinstein, and then Sam did one.

21:23.520 --> 21:28.580
 And Sam said, when I heard your podcast with David Wolpe, I learned stuff about what he

21:28.580 --> 21:32.640
 thinks that I never learned in my conversations with him because I can never let him make

21:32.640 --> 21:36.540
 those unfounded assertions without challenging them, and you just let them go.

21:36.540 --> 21:42.720
 And I think that there was something to that was like, he finds it hard to have a conversation

21:42.720 --> 21:51.500
 about religion that doesn't arouse his real ire about the harm that he thinks religion

21:51.500 --> 21:52.500
 does in the world.

21:52.500 --> 21:56.640
 So it's more about the implementation of religion in the world as it is versus the

21:56.640 --> 21:58.540
 really fundamental...

21:58.540 --> 22:03.880
 I think he also thinks it's fundamentally intellectually shoddy and disreputable.

22:03.880 --> 22:04.880
 Faith.

22:04.880 --> 22:05.880
 Yeah, faith.

22:05.880 --> 22:07.560
 I don't know how to put this.

22:07.560 --> 22:13.320
 I mean, they're both capable of separating their contempt for religion from the people

22:13.320 --> 22:15.640
 that they have sitting in front of them.

22:15.640 --> 22:18.000
 You mean Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris?

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
 Yes.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
 Both of them.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
 Okay.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
 So let me...

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
 You mentioned Eric Weinstein.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
 People should listen to your conversation with Eric.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
 It's a fascinating one.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
 It's great.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
 It's nonstandard.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
 It just goes all over the place in this humor and wit.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
 It's great.

22:31.000 --> 22:36.520
 There's one interesting aspect that I also learned, perhaps not about you but about Eric,

22:36.520 --> 22:37.520
 about both.

22:37.520 --> 22:44.800
 But Eric has a similar thing as with Jordan Peterson, which is if you ask them, do they

22:44.800 --> 22:48.080
 believe in God, I think the answer...

22:48.080 --> 22:52.180
 They're not comfortable answering that question, or they might say no, but they're usually

22:52.180 --> 22:54.440
 just not comfortable answering that question.

22:54.440 --> 23:01.160
 But there's a kind of sense that they would like to live life, a religious life, as if

23:01.160 --> 23:02.480
 God exists.

23:02.480 --> 23:03.960
 I think that's exactly right.

23:03.960 --> 23:08.280
 I think, first of all, Eric has a really deep appreciation of the Jewish tradition.

23:08.280 --> 23:09.760
 I don't know Peterson.

23:09.760 --> 23:12.720
 I've read his stuff and I've reviewed his stuff and so on.

23:12.720 --> 23:19.200
 But I think that Jungians are in their very approach.

23:19.200 --> 23:23.480
 They believe that myth is the way the world works.

23:23.480 --> 23:29.440
 And so it's not that big a leap to God, but there's still a distance there.

23:29.440 --> 23:32.820
 Is it possible to have your cake and eat it too?

23:32.820 --> 23:39.560
 Is it possible to have the depth of a religious life without believing in God?

23:39.560 --> 23:46.080
 How do you make sense of Eric Weinstein's devout life within the tradition?

23:46.080 --> 23:51.040
 I honestly think he believes in God, but doesn't believe in God and it's oscillating like it's

23:51.040 --> 23:54.200
 a quantum mechanical system of some sort.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.320
 Schrodinger's God.

23:56.320 --> 24:02.380
 So I think that he would probably agree with what Elie Wiesel said, that a Jew can be angry

24:02.380 --> 24:07.560
 at God or be disbelieving of God, but is not allowed to be indifferent to God.

24:07.560 --> 24:11.900
 And I think Eric's not indifferent to God.

24:11.900 --> 24:13.760
 And it's different than Christianity.

24:13.760 --> 24:22.960
 I've had this conversation many times because you can be very Jewish and have deep doubts

24:22.960 --> 24:29.620
 about theological questions because Judaism isn't a religion, it's a religious family.

24:29.620 --> 24:31.520
 And so you're born Jewish.

24:31.520 --> 24:36.560
 Like if I said to you tomorrow, if I was Christian and I said, oh, I believe in Jesus today and

24:36.560 --> 24:38.720
 then tomorrow I didn't, I'm not Christian anymore.

24:38.720 --> 24:42.660
 But if tomorrow I said, oh, I don't believe all this stuff, I'm still Jewish.

24:42.660 --> 24:46.720
 So it's a more complicated system.

24:46.720 --> 24:54.400
 Having said that though, I think it's very hard to sustain over generations without some

24:54.400 --> 24:57.840
 belief that the source of it is beyond ourselves.

24:57.840 --> 25:01.280
 And in that sense, as in many others, Eric is unique.

25:01.280 --> 25:10.080
 Well, he was actually making that claim that we need faith to propagate this tradition

25:10.080 --> 25:12.240
 through the generations.

25:12.240 --> 25:14.880
 So without that, the traditions crumble.

25:14.880 --> 25:22.880
 It's a very interesting idea and very interesting argument for devout faith, which is it's a

25:22.880 --> 25:25.400
 thing, it's a glue that holds a tradition together.

25:25.400 --> 25:31.600
 Otherwise like traditions fall apart because you can't have the intensity of that tradition.

25:31.600 --> 25:36.640
 I mean, on the other hand, you do see tradition, I mean, Thanksgiving, one of my favorite.

25:36.640 --> 25:42.200
 So I would say traditions that are demanding fall apart, traditions that require Turkey

25:42.200 --> 25:47.880
 might not fall apart, but traditions that make demands of you that are countercultural

25:47.880 --> 25:50.520
 or are hard, they fall apart.

25:50.520 --> 25:55.720
 I think I need to introduce you to some Thanksgiving dinners that are quite demanding, getting

25:55.720 --> 25:56.720
 the family together.

25:56.720 --> 26:02.040
 You know, there's a, first of all, I'm a vegetarian, so I'm tough to have at Thanksgiving dinner,

26:02.040 --> 26:07.280
 but there's a comedian, Cathy Landsman, who one year I heard this on the radio and it

26:07.280 --> 26:08.520
 stuck with me.

26:08.520 --> 26:13.760
 She said that holidays are a chance to renew your resentments afresh, you know, and that's

26:13.760 --> 26:15.640
 basically what people do with their families.

26:15.640 --> 26:20.080
 It's like, I'm going to go home and fight with the uncle again this year.

26:20.080 --> 26:25.400
 I apologize to take a dark turn, but you mentioned Elie Wiesel.

26:25.400 --> 26:32.280
 I recently saw a picture of Elie Wiesel when he was in the camp, when he was liberated.

26:32.280 --> 26:39.640
 For some reason that hit hard, like, you know, I've seen pictures in concentration camps

26:39.640 --> 26:46.520
 of people I don't know or whose words I haven't really felt and gone through, but for some

26:46.520 --> 26:54.320
 reason like here's just a normal person, like a normal body laying there, that just, that

26:54.320 --> 26:55.320
 was him.

26:55.320 --> 26:56.320
 I've seen it.

26:56.320 --> 27:02.080
 It's a, and, and you see, you can see his face, but at the same time you see that this

27:02.080 --> 27:07.720
 is an amazing, and I think what's so disturbing about it is exactly what you were saying is

27:07.720 --> 27:12.860
 I've seen a thousand people like this and I know this one and I know what he became.

27:12.860 --> 27:18.520
 So what about all those other people who look exactly like him who didn't make it out of

27:18.520 --> 27:19.520
 the camp?

27:19.520 --> 27:25.520
 I don't see his projection, but it seemed like this perhaps is also just combining with

27:25.520 --> 27:32.760
 man's search for meaning is it seemed like it was a regular day for them in the picture.

27:32.760 --> 27:38.020
 It didn't seem like, I mean, I'm not sure what I expect to see what suffering looks like,

27:38.020 --> 27:41.400
 but it's almost like there's no celebration.

27:41.400 --> 27:45.160
 I've never seen a picture of actually liberation be celebratory.

27:45.160 --> 27:46.200
 It's true.

27:46.200 --> 27:47.200
 It's really true.

27:47.200 --> 27:53.460
 So what do you make sense, and I apologize to take a step into that moment in history.

27:53.460 --> 28:03.620
 How does, how do you make sense of the Holocaust that, of Nazi Germany that such things could

28:03.620 --> 28:07.700
 be committed by human beings to each other?

28:07.700 --> 28:09.840
 Is it religion?

28:09.840 --> 28:13.440
 Is it the thirst for power?

28:13.440 --> 28:18.360
 Is it the madness of crowds somehow carrying us forward?

28:18.360 --> 28:21.160
 I mean, for me it's multi causal.

28:21.160 --> 28:22.720
 I don't think there's one reason.

28:22.720 --> 28:27.400
 So one of the things especially there has to do with the special nature of antisemitism,

28:27.400 --> 28:30.280
 which is let's put that to one side for the moment.

28:30.280 --> 28:34.320
 The second is I think human beings are fundamentally split.

28:34.320 --> 28:38.080
 They are mostly good except when put under certain pressures.

28:38.080 --> 28:43.500
 My first explanation for hatreds is as follows, go to a playground.

28:43.500 --> 28:45.560
 What happens when a new kid comes on the playground?

28:45.560 --> 28:49.320
 Do the other kids say, oh, let's go share our toys with the new kid?

28:49.320 --> 28:50.320
 No.

28:50.320 --> 28:56.080
 They say, oh, who's that stranger and let's go get them because otherness is built into

28:56.080 --> 29:03.400
 our genetic, I mean, we're tribal by nature and we see people form tribes all the time

29:03.400 --> 29:06.720
 of different kinds.

29:06.720 --> 29:13.440
 I asked you before if you were a chess player and when I was a kid and playing in tournaments

29:13.440 --> 29:17.520
 and I didn't do it for that long and I didn't do it that well, but when I was, it was like

29:17.520 --> 29:20.760
 the whole world was divided into people who could play chess and people who couldn't play

29:20.760 --> 29:25.600
 chess, which is ridiculous if you think about it as though that's the way you divide the

29:25.600 --> 29:26.600
 world.

29:26.600 --> 29:31.600
 But we tend to do that and the Jews were always the identifiable other.

29:31.600 --> 29:34.760
 There were Frenchmen and Jews, there were Russians and Jews, there were Germans and

29:34.760 --> 29:40.840
 Jews and the great blessing of America is that there's no identifiable other quite that

29:40.840 --> 29:49.420
 way is that there's all these minorities and no, there's not an American and a something.

29:49.420 --> 29:55.240
 But once you have that identifiable other and you have a long history of blaming that

29:55.240 --> 29:58.560
 identifiable other for all the ills that befall you.

29:58.560 --> 30:02.560
 Of course, people still do try to form, you said America, they still try to form other,

30:02.560 --> 30:07.520
 I mean, immigrant versus been here for a generation.

30:07.520 --> 30:09.080
 There's so many ways to slice it.

30:09.080 --> 30:11.080
 We still try to find ways.

30:11.080 --> 30:15.440
 It's just more difficult in America because there's so many sub tribes, hierarchies of

30:15.440 --> 30:16.880
 tribes and upon tribes.

30:16.880 --> 30:17.880
 You're absolutely right.

30:17.880 --> 30:23.320
 And I was moving fast because I didn't want to get bogged down in all the very difficult.

30:23.320 --> 30:24.320
 It's true.

30:24.320 --> 30:25.320
 I tried.

30:25.320 --> 30:27.640
 You're hoping I wouldn't mention that tribalism happens in America.

30:27.640 --> 30:33.120
 Skating, you know, when you're on thin ice, your safety is in your speed.

30:33.120 --> 30:35.320
 So I was trying to move fast.

30:35.320 --> 30:41.560
 But for most of history in Eastern Western Europe, not obviously in the, in Asia, but

30:41.560 --> 30:46.440
 in Eastern Western Europe, Jews were the ones who like, they're not like us.

30:46.440 --> 30:49.080
 They're clearly not like us.

30:49.080 --> 30:54.480
 And so, and in addition, there was, there's a peculiar quality and I don't know, I wonder

30:54.480 --> 30:56.320
 what you'll think of this explanation.

30:56.320 --> 31:00.880
 There's a peculiar quality to antisemitism that is unlike any other hatred that I know

31:00.880 --> 31:05.480
 of, which is Jews are both superhuman and subhuman.

31:05.480 --> 31:06.480
 They're vermin.

31:06.480 --> 31:10.720
 The Nazis thought of them as vermin and yet they control the world.

31:10.720 --> 31:15.080
 And there was an English scholar named Hyman Maccabee who said the reason that that's

31:15.080 --> 31:19.880
 so is the myth that Jews killed God.

31:19.880 --> 31:24.280
 They killed Jesus and to kill a God, you have to be superhumanly evil.

31:24.280 --> 31:27.520
 You can't just be bad, otherwise you can't kill a God.

31:27.520 --> 31:35.280
 So there is some like supercharged evil sense that people got from that about Jews that

31:35.280 --> 31:36.800
 still in here.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.040
 Yeah, that's true.

31:38.040 --> 31:44.000
 A lot of the way we formulate the other in terms of tribes is often they're subhuman

31:44.000 --> 31:48.160
 and they're here to steal our resources, like on the playground.

31:48.160 --> 31:54.040
 But to be both is a fascinating construction.

31:54.040 --> 31:58.760
 Do you agree with Solzhenitsyn that all of us have the capacity for evil?

31:58.760 --> 32:01.560
 A hundred percent runs through every human heart.

32:01.560 --> 32:03.880
 I have no doubt about it.

32:03.880 --> 32:09.960
 And I know as you probably do, but I probably know more both because of what I do and because

32:09.960 --> 32:12.360
 I have lived a lot longer than you.

32:12.360 --> 32:19.640
 I know a lot of religious leaders who people thought or think are above the human and they

32:19.640 --> 32:21.400
 are emphatically not.

32:21.400 --> 32:22.460
 They're not.

32:22.460 --> 32:26.560
 Some of them have done horrible things and they've used their position to do horrible

32:26.560 --> 32:28.000
 things.

32:28.000 --> 32:32.200
 And it's because there is no perfect saint.

32:32.200 --> 32:38.320
 There's no, you know, I mean, all through history you discover all these saintly characters

32:38.320 --> 32:42.600
 that we worship, the people who actually knew them around them, some liked them and some

32:42.600 --> 32:44.400
 didn't.

32:44.400 --> 32:46.080
 People are complicated, all of us.

32:46.080 --> 32:51.500
 And the tough thing is, the thing that's the toughest for me is it's not very always clear

32:51.500 --> 32:55.840
 what is good and what is evil.

32:55.840 --> 33:02.480
 Because certainly if you just look at history and it's not always propaganda, I, you know,

33:02.480 --> 33:12.080
 I really believe that some part of Stalin thought he was doing good, legitimately.

33:12.080 --> 33:16.760
 And it makes you ask a question of yourself.

33:16.760 --> 33:20.160
 For those of us who want to do good in the world, am I actually doing good?

33:20.160 --> 33:25.120
 And that's a really difficult question, like in the technology sphere, for example, in

33:25.120 --> 33:30.240
 this dream of creating technology that will do some good, am I actually doing good?

33:30.240 --> 33:32.640
 So I have a question about that myself.

33:32.640 --> 33:33.640
 Not about Stalin.

33:33.640 --> 33:35.680
 I'm sure that Stalin thought so.

33:35.680 --> 33:39.600
 Stalin does not strike me from what I know of him as somebody given to a lot of self

33:39.600 --> 33:40.880
 doubt.

33:40.880 --> 33:46.600
 But the question with AI to me is actually, it goes back to the God question, which is,

33:46.600 --> 33:53.960
 if we have an appreciation of the limitations of our own intelligence, that we know that

33:53.960 --> 34:00.020
 just like we can only hear certain things and see certain colors, how much of the world

34:00.020 --> 34:06.420
 is inaccessible to us because of the way our brains are constructed, how can we possibly

34:06.420 --> 34:12.280
 have any confidence that we can create things that in certain ways are far more intelligent

34:12.280 --> 34:19.600
 than we are and control them the way we think is best, seems to me a hubris that might end

34:19.600 --> 34:21.840
 up being destructive.

34:21.840 --> 34:22.840
 Definitely.

34:22.840 --> 34:28.360
 Well, any sentence with the word hubris in it is going to end badly when implemented

34:28.360 --> 34:30.160
 at scale.

34:30.160 --> 34:32.120
 But there is also beauty.

34:32.120 --> 34:37.560
 So if you approach it with humility, there is a sense, I don't want to over romanticize

34:37.560 --> 34:43.280
 it, but there is a legged robot right behind you, which is hilarious.

34:43.280 --> 34:51.800
 So there's a magic, I don't have kids, I would love to have kids.

34:51.800 --> 34:59.600
 But there's a magic to bringing robots to life that it feels like you are a mini God,

34:59.600 --> 35:04.800
 because you just breathe life into an entity that operates in this world, especially when

35:04.800 --> 35:10.120
 they have legs and they move in this way, that's in the case of the four legged robots,

35:10.120 --> 35:15.240
 like a dog that I think, I don't think I'm over romanticizing it.

35:15.240 --> 35:17.880
 The feeling is like you would with a child.

35:17.880 --> 35:21.920
 You just gave birth like, holy crap, this is a living thing.

35:21.920 --> 35:24.880
 I wonder what he or she are thinking about.

35:24.880 --> 35:29.600
 By the way, I'm not at all insensible to how remarkable it must feel to create that.

35:29.600 --> 35:34.780
 I'm actually worried in part about how remarkable it feels to create that because to maintain

35:34.780 --> 35:42.880
 humility and perspective when it's such a fantastic thing is what's difficult.

35:42.880 --> 35:50.560
 And I think also because creativity is both part of what it is to be human and it's very

35:50.560 --> 35:56.420
 much part of the legacy of Western civilization and the legacy of having a creator God.

35:56.420 --> 36:02.120
 If you have a tradition where God is known primarily through what God creates, so the

36:02.120 --> 36:06.400
 first debate I ever had since we talked about humor and God and creating, let me give you

36:06.400 --> 36:09.440
 my one God creating joke.

36:09.440 --> 36:14.880
 Because the first debate I ever had on religion and science was with Stephen Jay Gould and

36:14.880 --> 36:18.960
 it was wonderful because he had a deep interest in religion and his interest was actually

36:18.960 --> 36:22.800
 not to say religion is terrible.

36:22.800 --> 36:28.520
 But I started with this joke and I think it made the debate go a little bit easier.

36:28.520 --> 36:33.420
 So the time has come when human beings can do everything that God can do and a scientist

36:33.420 --> 36:37.000
 looks up at heaven and says, God, look, you were great in your day and we thank you for

36:37.000 --> 36:39.400
 everything you did, but now we don't need you.

36:39.400 --> 36:40.560
 And God says, really, you don't need me?

36:40.560 --> 36:42.440
 He says, no, we can do everything you did.

36:42.440 --> 36:44.120
 God says, everything?

36:44.120 --> 36:46.240
 And the human being says, yeah, we can do everything.

36:46.240 --> 36:49.760
 God says, okay, can you create a human being?

36:49.760 --> 36:51.760
 And the scientist goes, yeah.

36:51.760 --> 36:52.760
 God says, from dirt?

36:52.760 --> 36:53.760
 And the scientist goes, yeah.

36:53.760 --> 36:54.760
 He says, okay, let me see.

36:54.760 --> 36:58.600
 The scientist reaches down, scoops up some dirt and God says, uh, uh, uh, get your own

36:58.600 --> 37:02.280
 dirt.

37:02.280 --> 37:05.720
 But the idea is that a creator God impels us to create too.

37:05.720 --> 37:10.840
 But let me bring up Nietzsche, who proclaimed that God is dead.

37:10.840 --> 37:14.680
 Is belief in God slowly disappearing from our world, do you think?

37:14.680 --> 37:18.400
 And what kind of impact does that have on society?

37:18.400 --> 37:21.860
 You wrote that religion is not our enemy.

37:21.860 --> 37:25.880
 Before the Western faiths captured the heart of our world, there was cruelty, carnage,

37:25.880 --> 37:26.880
 and destruction.

37:26.880 --> 37:31.320
 In the 20th century, when religion ceased to be a force of international politics, the

37:31.320 --> 37:36.400
 scale of human slaughter was far beyond anything human beings have ever known.

37:36.400 --> 37:39.520
 What is the world like when we take religion out of it?

37:39.520 --> 37:41.600
 I mean, I think Nietzsche was largely right.

37:41.600 --> 37:44.200
 You know, it wasn't a statement about God.

37:44.200 --> 37:49.160
 It was a statement about God's presence in the world.

37:49.160 --> 37:57.080
 And I think that that's largely true, that God is not a force in a lot of Western society.

37:57.080 --> 38:06.920
 And I believe that if the force of nihilism has no clear counter without an idea that

38:06.920 --> 38:13.000
 we're all here for a purpose and that our lives are inherently meaningful and that there's

38:13.000 --> 38:17.540
 a God who wishes us to be better.

38:17.540 --> 38:22.640
 So I worry a lot about it, and I think that the sort of optimism that things are just

38:22.640 --> 38:28.400
 going to get better and better is what one philosopher called cut flower ethics.

38:28.400 --> 38:32.780
 That is, we're still living off the morals that religion gave us, but now that they're

38:32.780 --> 38:36.880
 separate from the soil that gave birth to them, I see them wilting.

38:36.880 --> 38:41.480
 So this kind of optimism for the future of human civilization, you think, is in part

38:41.480 --> 38:45.040
 grounded in a religious society.

38:45.040 --> 38:46.240
 I really do believe that.

38:46.240 --> 38:49.760
 I mean, it was religion that the Greeks look back at the golden age of the past.

38:49.760 --> 38:53.000
 It was the Jews who said, no, the golden age is in the future, right?

38:53.000 --> 38:54.760
 It's the Messiah.

38:54.760 --> 39:00.280
 And I think that that idea that we're moving towards something better, which I really believe

39:00.280 --> 39:08.800
 humanity can do and absent destroying ourselves will do, you know, I mean, I'm very excited

39:08.800 --> 39:10.820
 about the technology that I won't live to see.

39:10.820 --> 39:12.240
 I think it's fantastic.

39:12.240 --> 39:16.160
 And that excitement is a kind of religious excitement because there's a reason to preserve

39:16.160 --> 39:17.160
 this whole thing.

39:17.160 --> 39:18.160
 Absolutely.

39:18.160 --> 39:23.320
 Because I really think, I know this sounds absurdly anthropomorphic, but I really think

39:23.320 --> 39:25.240
 God is cheering us on.

39:25.240 --> 39:27.960
 I feel like this is why we're here.

39:27.960 --> 39:35.000
 We're here to grow in soul and to grow each other in soul.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.840
 Yeah.

39:37.840 --> 39:42.880
 So what do you think the world, so if you just think of this force of nihilism that's

39:42.880 --> 39:52.960
 contending with the force of faith based optimism, what do you make of the atrocities in the

39:52.960 --> 39:54.480
 20th century?

39:54.480 --> 40:02.160
 Do you think at its core, it's part of human nature and has nothing to do with religion

40:02.160 --> 40:03.480
 or not religion?

40:03.480 --> 40:07.440
 Or do you think you can assign this kind of nihilistic view of the world?

40:07.440 --> 40:12.720
 I think it has to do with a religion that doesn't make ethical demands.

40:12.720 --> 40:20.600
 That is, for Stalin and for Hitler, they both had religions, in a sense, but they were religions

40:20.600 --> 40:23.760
 that didn't make ethical demands for the other.

40:23.760 --> 40:27.540
 I mean, 36 times the Torah talks about the stranger.

40:27.540 --> 40:33.760
 The point is, it's trying to educate people away from their natural inclination towards

40:33.760 --> 40:36.460
 distrusting and disliking the other.

40:36.460 --> 40:40.040
 And it's a lot of work that's really difficult to do.

40:40.040 --> 40:50.280
 But if you have a tribal passion and not a universal ethic, then you're in trouble.

40:50.280 --> 40:54.640
 Well, the Jewish tribe is a very strong tribe.

40:54.640 --> 41:00.880
 So how do you make sense of this mention of the stranger versus the power of the tribe,

41:00.880 --> 41:04.920
 which is the whole point, not the point, but the mechanism of tradition propagates the

41:04.920 --> 41:05.920
 tribe.

41:05.920 --> 41:06.920
 So it's both.

41:06.920 --> 41:10.280
 I mean, the Torah does not start with Jews.

41:10.280 --> 41:12.000
 It starts with Adam and Eve.

41:12.000 --> 41:16.920
 That's a way of saying, yeah, this is going to be a story about a people, but understand

41:16.920 --> 41:20.780
 that prior to a kind of people, there are people.

41:20.780 --> 41:24.320
 I'm a human being before I'm a Jew.

41:24.320 --> 41:30.660
 And in fact, the Jewish New Year, the Muslim New Year starts with Muhammad's journey.

41:30.660 --> 41:33.080
 And the Christian New Year starts with Jesus's birth.

41:33.080 --> 41:38.040
 The Jewish New Year starts with the creation of the world because the idea is, yes, this

41:38.040 --> 41:44.800
 is a particularist tradition, but it makes a universal statement, which is all of humanity

41:44.800 --> 41:49.800
 is a child, are in the image of God, are children of God.

41:49.800 --> 41:57.500
 I think that the idea of Judaism was to try to exemplify a certain way of making that

41:57.500 --> 41:59.300
 statement over and over again.

41:59.300 --> 42:04.520
 And I want to say one other thing about chosenness that's very name droppy, but when I tell

42:04.520 --> 42:07.040
 you how I got there, it won't be as name droppy.

42:07.040 --> 42:11.280
 So my brother is a professor at Emory.

42:11.280 --> 42:15.520
 And so is the Dalai Lama actually teaches at Emory, although he no longer does because

42:15.520 --> 42:18.520
 he's too old to go to Emory, but for many years taught at Emory.

42:18.520 --> 42:23.360
 And so my brother brought us, he's the head of the bio of the ethics center at Emory.

42:23.360 --> 42:24.360
 He's a bioethicist.

42:24.360 --> 42:28.220
 So he brought a bunch of students to Dharamsala to meet with the Dalai Lama.

42:28.220 --> 42:33.000
 So I went to India, I was on sabbatical then anyway, I met my brother there and we had

42:33.000 --> 42:34.920
 a chance to meet with the Dalai Lama.

42:34.920 --> 42:35.920
 Okay.

42:35.920 --> 42:36.920
 That was the name drop.

42:36.920 --> 42:40.080
 So we're sitting in the, before he speaks to the students, he was speaking to us, but

42:40.080 --> 42:43.080
 not because I just wanted to make it clear, not because he said, oh, I got to talk to

42:43.080 --> 42:44.080
 that rabbi.

42:44.080 --> 42:48.560
 We just happened to be, I happened to glom along with my brother.

42:48.560 --> 42:49.560
 We sit down.

42:49.560 --> 42:53.200
 The first thing he says is he points at me and says, what's this about the chosen people

42:53.200 --> 42:54.200
 anyway?

42:54.200 --> 43:00.160
 So, and he had, by the way, he had asked that I give a lecture, which I did later to, to

43:00.160 --> 43:03.880
 them, to his monks about how Jews survived in the diaspora.

43:03.880 --> 43:05.400
 So it's not like he doesn't know about Judaism.

43:05.400 --> 43:09.640
 He knows a lot about it, but he says to me right away with, so I said, yes, Jews believe

43:09.640 --> 43:13.540
 that they were chosen for a certain mission in this world, but that doesn't mean other

43:13.540 --> 43:16.000
 people weren't chosen for other sorts of things.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.760
 They certainly, I mean, it seems to me that other people believe they're chosen for things

43:19.760 --> 43:20.760
 too.

43:20.760 --> 43:24.640
 They burst out laughing and said, yeah, we also think we're chosen.

43:24.640 --> 43:25.640
 So I think it's universal.

43:25.640 --> 43:34.600
 The idea is that no tribe is better than, from a Jewish perspective, you're chosen for

43:34.600 --> 43:38.920
 a thing, but that doesn't make you better.

43:38.920 --> 43:39.920
 No.

43:39.920 --> 43:43.000
 The only place where the betters came in, honestly, if I'm going to, historically, if

43:43.000 --> 43:50.240
 I'm going to be honest, was not with the idea that you, but it was when Jews were small

43:50.240 --> 43:52.200
 persecuted.

43:52.200 --> 43:56.080
 The way that you take this sort of psychic revenge is by saying, no, we're better than

43:56.080 --> 43:59.080
 our persecutors even.

43:59.080 --> 44:04.880
 But the idea is, yeah, different people have different missions, which is, I mean, like

44:04.880 --> 44:08.680
 there was a Jewish philosopher, Franz Rosenzweig, who used to say, he didn't know very much

44:08.680 --> 44:09.680
 about Islam.

44:09.680 --> 44:14.520
 He used to say, Judaism is the sun and Christianity was the rays of the sun.

44:14.520 --> 44:18.160
 Like Judaism introduced the idea of God and Christianity brought it to the world.

44:18.160 --> 44:21.200
 Can you speak to this difference?

44:21.200 --> 44:28.160
 What is the difference and similarities between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam?

44:28.160 --> 44:30.600
 The religious family part is different.

44:30.600 --> 44:38.680
 And the greatest difference, which I talked about in the Eric Weinstein podcast, is that

44:38.680 --> 44:44.200
 Islam and Judaism are more similar in a lot of ways than Judaism and Christianity.

44:44.200 --> 44:52.360
 And the reason that that is so is Christianity in its core is not a religion of law.

44:52.360 --> 44:56.960
 The reason it's not a religion of law is because it grew up in the Roman Empire, so law was

44:56.960 --> 44:57.960
 taken care of.

44:57.960 --> 45:02.440
 I mean, Jesus didn't have to create civil law because you had Roman law.

45:02.440 --> 45:06.520
 Muhammad and Moses created a religion in the desert where there was no law.

45:06.520 --> 45:12.080
 So you have to create a religion of law, otherwise you have anarchy.

45:12.080 --> 45:17.000
 And that's why in a lot of ways, there was never a separation of church and state in

45:17.000 --> 45:18.200
 Islam or Judaism.

45:18.200 --> 45:21.120
 That was a gift that Christianity gave the world.

45:21.120 --> 45:24.540
 And it could do it because of render unto Caesar what is Caesar's.

45:24.540 --> 45:26.720
 But when Moses came along, there was no Caesar.

45:26.720 --> 45:29.080
 When Muhammad came along, there was no Caesar.

45:29.080 --> 45:34.360
 So historically, the traditions shaped differently.

45:34.360 --> 45:42.960
 But all three of them have this core, I think, the single most important statement and insight

45:42.960 --> 45:48.480
 in all of human history, which is that every human being is in the image of God.

45:48.480 --> 45:54.100
 And if you really believe that, that's a transformative belief.

45:54.100 --> 45:59.640
 So that means you should love thy neighbor as yourself.

45:59.640 --> 46:02.660
 Which comes from Leviticus, comes straight from the Torah.

46:02.660 --> 46:07.400
 So I don't know if you know, I've been chatting with Omar Suleiman, I don't know if you know

46:07.400 --> 46:08.400
 who that is.

46:08.400 --> 46:11.000
 He's an imam in Dallas, a great guy.

46:11.000 --> 46:16.120
 I enjoy his interfaith dialogues that he engages in.

46:16.120 --> 46:19.880
 And do you ever do that kind of talk with Christians, with Muslims?

46:19.880 --> 46:20.880
 Yes, often.

46:20.880 --> 46:21.880
 Often.

46:21.880 --> 46:26.840
 I mean, I do whenever I at least listen to them in the context of these kinds of conversations.

46:26.840 --> 46:33.880
 There's so much love and humor and empathy and appreciation, and also ability to make

46:33.880 --> 46:37.680
 fun of the quirks of the little...

46:37.680 --> 46:38.680
 Of one's own.

46:38.680 --> 46:41.040
 Of one's own communities.

46:41.040 --> 46:46.560
 So it's not necessarily the depths or the details of the traditions, but these are communities

46:46.560 --> 46:51.640
 and they're full of people and they're full of weird people, because we're all weird.

46:51.640 --> 46:57.640
 And so there is very particular flavors of weirdness that emerge and they can make fun

46:57.640 --> 46:59.160
 of them.

46:59.160 --> 47:03.580
 And in that way, they can talk about some beautiful ideas.

47:03.580 --> 47:07.280
 So I mean, I don't know, do you engage in these kinds of things?

47:07.280 --> 47:09.120
 What do you learn from them?

47:09.120 --> 47:12.640
 So one of the things I learned is exactly what you said, that personalities that you

47:12.640 --> 47:18.120
 think are unique to your own community, in fact, they exist in all sorts of communities.

47:18.120 --> 47:23.360
 And religious communities in particular draw, I think, some interesting personalities.

47:23.360 --> 47:33.620
 And also that the, especially as clergy, some of the pressures that you feel are shared.

47:33.620 --> 47:38.120
 And it's weird, again, it has to do with that tribal association.

47:38.120 --> 47:44.240
 There's almost like there's an understanding among clergy because they have similar...

47:44.240 --> 47:49.300
 And it's a strange role in the following way.

47:49.300 --> 47:52.040
 It's one that you never escape.

47:52.040 --> 47:58.120
 That is, you're not my lawyer at the supermarket, but you are my rabbi at the supermarket.

47:58.120 --> 48:03.740
 I mean, it doesn't matter why you're there, that's not an escapable role.

48:03.740 --> 48:14.200
 And every religious leader is aware of that strange assumption of stepping into something

48:14.200 --> 48:16.440
 that you can never step out of.

48:16.440 --> 48:24.800
 But you're also the source where people go to think about the deepest question of our

48:24.800 --> 48:27.480
 lives and our universe.

48:27.480 --> 48:32.600
 And so that's some heavy, when people are suffering, they look to you for answers.

48:32.600 --> 48:36.120
 I mean, every privilege comes with a cost of one kind or another.

48:36.120 --> 48:41.080
 The reason you get to be in that role is exactly because you get the privilege of being there

48:41.080 --> 48:44.200
 at crucial moments in people's lives.

48:44.200 --> 48:51.820
 I mean, the fact that I get to marry people and get to give eulogies for people and come

48:51.820 --> 48:56.080
 to the hospital, it's inexpressible.

48:56.080 --> 49:00.720
 I have this joke with people that I know that like when I'm sitting on the couch and it's

49:00.720 --> 49:03.200
 Saturday night, I don't wanna get up and go to a wedding.

49:03.200 --> 49:04.200
 I really don't.

49:04.200 --> 49:07.660
 I wanna sit there and watch Netflix like everybody else.

49:07.660 --> 49:14.960
 But when I'm actually doing the wedding, I always love it, always, always, always.

49:14.960 --> 49:20.600
 And the reason is that I don't think, I mean, yes, people go to you for answers in calmer

49:20.600 --> 49:21.600
 conversations.

49:21.600 --> 49:25.040
 Like if you asked me now, like what's my theory of why God allows evil, I could give

49:25.040 --> 49:28.100
 you a conversation about it.

49:28.100 --> 49:32.760
 But they really go for presence and comfort, not really for answers.

49:32.760 --> 49:37.440
 When someone's suffering, an answer doesn't make them unsuffer.

49:37.440 --> 49:39.520
 It's just they wanna know they're not alone.

49:39.520 --> 49:40.520
 Yeah.

49:40.520 --> 49:45.800
 To be heard and just to feel things in silence together.

49:45.800 --> 49:52.480
 In terms of weddings and marriage, what's the role of that whole, I need to take some

49:52.480 --> 49:53.480
 notes here.

49:53.480 --> 49:54.480
 What's...

49:54.480 --> 49:55.480
 The role of a rabbi?

49:55.480 --> 49:59.340
 The role of marriage in human existence.

49:59.340 --> 50:05.840
 It is first of all to teach you how to care for someone unlike you, which could be anyone

50:05.840 --> 50:08.720
 you marry.

50:08.720 --> 50:12.960
 And I think it's to create a home and a family.

50:12.960 --> 50:15.680
 So there's a commitment to it, so care for a long time.

50:15.680 --> 50:16.680
 Right.

50:16.680 --> 50:17.680
 Exactly.

50:17.680 --> 50:21.200
 And also when couples come to me and they say, we don't need to be married because it

50:21.200 --> 50:23.720
 really won't change how we think about ourselves and our relationship.

50:23.720 --> 50:27.440
 I say to them, that's true, it might not, but it will change how everyone else looks

50:27.440 --> 50:28.480
 at you.

50:28.480 --> 50:32.240
 And because it changes how everyone else looks at you, it changes you.

50:32.240 --> 50:36.040
 Because it's one thing to say, this is my partner, it's another thing to say, this is

50:36.040 --> 50:37.040
 my husband.

50:37.040 --> 50:42.320
 You say this is my husband, that means we've made a real commitment to this.

50:42.320 --> 50:43.320
 Yeah.

50:43.320 --> 50:52.920
 What do you, do you worry that there's a dissolution of that as well in terms of how, you know,

50:52.920 --> 50:59.080
 as religion dissipates, like it loosens its hold on society, loosens its impact on society.

50:59.080 --> 51:00.360
 Do you worry about that?

51:00.360 --> 51:02.440
 I worry about it.

51:02.440 --> 51:07.840
 I do think that it is possible that we're going, rather than a dissolution, we're going

51:07.840 --> 51:09.560
 through a transition.

51:09.560 --> 51:13.960
 That is different kinds of families and different configurations of families.

51:13.960 --> 51:20.080
 That is, I see some of that, but I also do see a, it's less a dissolution of marriage

51:20.080 --> 51:22.880
 than it is of the idea of commitment.

51:22.880 --> 51:24.960
 And I'll give you like a simple example.

51:24.960 --> 51:31.960
 When I was growing up, a player on a sports team was always on that team.

51:31.960 --> 51:35.620
 And you rooted for the team because you knew the players for 20 years.

51:35.620 --> 51:40.740
 Now there are very good reasons, starting with Curt Flood, why people got free agency

51:40.740 --> 51:42.920
 and they can move around and it's better for the players.

51:42.920 --> 51:44.280
 I understand all that.

51:44.280 --> 51:48.400
 And I am not, I'm not saying, oh, they should continue.

51:48.400 --> 51:56.400
 But just like people move jobs and they move sports teams and they change careers, they

51:56.400 --> 51:58.640
 change partners.

51:58.640 --> 52:05.840
 And there is a, there is a diminishment of the commitment to commitment that I actually

52:05.840 --> 52:09.840
 think has serious societal consequences and that I am worried about.

52:09.840 --> 52:10.840
 Yeah.

52:10.840 --> 52:11.840
 There's a cost to that.

52:11.840 --> 52:15.920
 I don't know what it is about commitment that's beautiful.

52:15.920 --> 52:19.840
 Like through, because like some of the deepest friendships I have is when we've gone through

52:19.840 --> 52:20.840
 some shit together.

52:20.840 --> 52:21.840
 Yeah.

52:21.840 --> 52:26.400
 And so like the hard times, going through hard times together, especially when the hard

52:26.400 --> 52:32.680
 times are between the two of you, that, that if, I mean, that's always a risk, but if it,

52:32.680 --> 52:37.320
 if you can find a way through that can bond you stronger, that's the fascinating thing

52:37.320 --> 52:38.320
 about human relations.

52:38.320 --> 52:39.320
 There's no question.

52:39.320 --> 52:45.040
 And even if it doesn't keep you forever, you still have a connection that doesn't, that

52:45.040 --> 52:46.560
 exists that.

52:46.560 --> 52:48.840
 So I can give you one where you said, what is it about commitment?

52:48.840 --> 52:52.000
 I'll give you one, I think beautiful answer.

52:52.000 --> 52:58.480
 Someone once asked Rabbi Soloveitchik, who was a great thinker and leader in the Orthodox

52:58.480 --> 53:00.200
 community in the 20th century.

53:00.200 --> 53:02.120
 They said, you know, I go from religion to religion.

53:02.120 --> 53:05.640
 I just take what I think is beautiful in it.

53:05.640 --> 53:09.960
 And his answer was that you're treating religion like a nomad.

53:09.960 --> 53:14.400
 He said, nomads go from place to place and they eat what they want and they move on.

53:14.400 --> 53:16.280
 He says, farmers stay in one place.

53:16.280 --> 53:19.840
 The difference is farmers make things grow.

53:19.840 --> 53:23.460
 And I think that that's true also, when you think about the relationships you have, things

53:23.460 --> 53:29.280
 have grown out of the relationships that you've invested in, that you farmed basically, that

53:29.280 --> 53:35.320
 can't exist in fly by night relationships.

53:35.320 --> 53:38.760
 Can you talk about, can we talk about the Torah?

53:38.760 --> 53:39.760
 Yes.

53:39.760 --> 53:40.760
 What is it?

53:40.760 --> 53:46.000
 And is it the literal word of God?

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
 Easy questions.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
 Yeah.

53:48.000 --> 53:52.240
 Well, the Torah is the five books of Moses written in Hebrew.

53:52.240 --> 53:57.900
 I like most, I think modern rabbis, non Orthodox or non literalist rabbis will tell you that

53:57.900 --> 54:01.320
 it's a product of human beings.

54:01.320 --> 54:08.400
 And I believe that they are inspired by God, but it's clear to me that it's a human product.

54:08.400 --> 54:14.880
 And I think that people who study modern biblical criticism, it's really hard to study modern

54:14.880 --> 54:17.960
 criticism, it gives a wrong impression.

54:17.960 --> 54:23.960
 I would say modern scholarship on the Bible and not appreciate the fact that it even has

54:23.960 --> 54:25.640
 levels of language.

54:25.640 --> 54:32.360
 I mean, it's just like if you read today, somebody writing like Shakespeare, you would

54:32.360 --> 54:36.160
 say this isn't, it's like English has developed.

54:36.160 --> 54:37.160
 It's different.

54:37.160 --> 54:38.440
 It's not the English we speak today.

54:38.440 --> 54:42.360
 And if you study the Bible and you know Hebrew well enough, you even see that this was written

54:42.360 --> 54:46.840
 over hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years.

54:46.840 --> 54:48.400
 It is a holy book.

54:48.400 --> 54:56.080
 And I like the idea that it is, what you say in Hebrew is Torah is from heaven, but it's

54:56.080 --> 54:57.860
 not from Sinai.

54:57.860 --> 55:03.600
 So it has its origin beyond us, but it has things in it that I think, and this is one

55:03.600 --> 55:11.220
 of the things that was a huge controversy at my congregation when I started to do same

55:11.220 --> 55:13.280
 sex marriages.

55:13.280 --> 55:19.040
 There are some people who try to argue that the Torah does not forbid them.

55:19.040 --> 55:24.160
 Whether it does or not, it seems to me, we understand things that were not understood

55:24.160 --> 55:27.920
 in the ancient world about gender and sexuality.

55:27.920 --> 55:35.680
 And so you think that in the scripture, in the words, you can find the kind of spirit

55:35.680 --> 55:38.000
 that supports the idea of gay marriage.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
 Well, that's yes.

55:39.000 --> 55:43.200
 That's my argument is that you criticize the Torah by the Torah.

55:43.200 --> 55:54.240
 That is, it gives you the understanding that you use to evaluate its own claims.

55:54.240 --> 55:57.640
 And I think that Judaism, by the way, has always done that because it's clear that there

55:57.640 --> 56:04.520
 are things in the Torah that the rabbis changed, altered, grew, expanded, diminished.

56:04.520 --> 56:07.520
 I think that's what it is to be part of a living tradition.

56:07.520 --> 56:08.520
 Yeah.

56:08.520 --> 56:15.280
 You wrote in your book, Why Faith Matters, quote, Walt Whitman wrote that in order for

56:15.280 --> 56:18.520
 there to be a great books, there must be great readers.

56:18.520 --> 56:23.160
 For a book to remain powerful throughout generations, it cannot have a single meaning.

56:23.160 --> 56:26.760
 Scripture like great poetry is not reducible to other words.

56:26.760 --> 56:33.480
 That is, one cannot paraphrase it and capture the totality of its meaning.

56:33.480 --> 56:38.780
 So how the heck do you capture the meaning of the words in scripture?

56:38.780 --> 56:41.120
 Is it an ongoing process through the centuries?

56:41.120 --> 56:42.120
 Yes.

56:42.120 --> 56:43.120
 Is that essentially what it is?

56:43.120 --> 56:44.120
 Exactly so.

56:44.120 --> 56:53.960
 It's a continual conversation of sages, scholars, readers, strugglers, seekers, mystics, visionaries,

56:53.960 --> 56:55.480
 all of them making a contribution.

56:55.480 --> 57:00.000
 I mean, I write a weekly Torah column for the Jerusalem Post.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.400
 Now what is there left to say?

57:03.400 --> 57:08.380
 But every week what I do is I start opening books and seeing what people say and it starts

57:08.380 --> 57:14.240
 to percolate and you realize that you're entering this conversation that's been going on for

57:14.240 --> 57:23.960
 thousands of years with remarkable minds and it's constantly fertile in new insights.

57:23.960 --> 57:27.160
 So yes, that's what it is to be part of a tradition.

57:27.160 --> 57:29.200
 Why do people keep writing love poems?

57:29.200 --> 57:33.080
 We should have figured out love by this point already.

57:33.080 --> 57:35.720
 I use the analogy sometimes of diet books.

57:35.720 --> 57:42.020
 If any diet worked, there would be one book, there'd be one book and you'd be done.

57:42.020 --> 57:45.720
 You mentioned this fascinating story that you were a part of.

57:45.720 --> 57:48.840
 You were a part of several controversies in your life.

57:48.840 --> 57:50.840
 I've had a few.

57:50.840 --> 57:56.320
 For someone who walks with grace through the fire, you sure have found yourself in a lot

57:56.320 --> 57:57.320
 of fires.

57:57.320 --> 58:03.360
 One of them, can you tell me the story of your views on gay marriage, the underlying

58:03.360 --> 58:10.660
 principles that led you to fight this battle of defending gay marriage in the Jewish community?

58:10.660 --> 58:19.480
 So I'm part of a congregation that is really politically split and split not only politically

58:19.480 --> 58:24.040
 but split in terms of origin.

58:24.040 --> 58:27.800
 We have a lot of Jews from the Middle East, from Iran, a lot of Persian Jews, a lot of

58:27.800 --> 58:34.560
 Jews from Israel, some from Mexico, from other places and many that grew up in LA.

58:34.560 --> 58:37.560
 Do you have any Russian Jews, the best kind?

58:37.560 --> 58:45.080
 I have a few Russian Jews, not as many as I should, but we'll work on that.

58:45.080 --> 58:54.080
 What happened was increasingly I became uncomfortable with people who would come to me and say,

58:54.080 --> 58:58.120
 this is the only kind of person I can love.

58:58.120 --> 59:02.740
 It's not the same question as an intermarriage, as a Jew marrying a non Jew, because you could

59:02.740 --> 59:03.740
 find a Jew to love.

59:03.740 --> 59:08.040
 You may not have found, but you could.

59:08.040 --> 59:10.000
 That's a whole separate question.

59:10.000 --> 59:15.320
 But I would have men in my office primarily, a couple of women, they would say, this is

59:15.320 --> 59:20.360
 the only kind of person that I can enter into an intimate relationship with.

59:20.360 --> 59:26.360
 How can it be that my religion has no room for me?

59:26.360 --> 59:30.500
 And that was very persuasive to me.

59:30.500 --> 59:37.240
 But I knew that it was going to be explosive in my community.

59:37.240 --> 59:40.340
 Then by the way, it finally happened, it was literally on the front page of the New York

59:40.340 --> 59:41.340
 and the LA Times.

59:41.340 --> 59:42.400
 It was that explosive.

59:42.400 --> 59:46.920
 So it was not a small controversy.

59:46.920 --> 59:51.680
 And so what I did was I started to teach classes.

59:51.680 --> 59:56.600
 Not that many people came about homosexuality and Jewish tradition and so on.

59:56.600 --> 1:00:01.320
 It's funny, much, much less about lesbianism, I'm talking about in terms of the sources

1:00:01.320 --> 1:00:02.320
 and so on.

1:00:02.320 --> 1:00:06.520
 It's almost always about homosexuality.

1:00:06.520 --> 1:00:14.160
 So and then I got ready to send out a letter.

1:00:14.160 --> 1:00:22.440
 And I said to my daughter, who at the time was maybe 10 or 11, now in her mid 20s.

1:00:22.440 --> 1:00:27.880
 I said, look, honey, when you go to school tomorrow or whatever it was, I said, people

1:00:27.880 --> 1:00:31.640
 might be saying bad things about your dad and I just want you to be prepared for that.

1:00:31.640 --> 1:00:32.860
 She said, why?

1:00:32.860 --> 1:00:38.560
 And I said, because I'm going to start marrying, I'm going to start doing same sex marriages.

1:00:38.560 --> 1:00:43.180
 And she looked at me quizzically and said, what took you so long?

1:00:43.180 --> 1:00:48.000
 And I thought, really her face was like I said to her, I'm going to start marrying blonde

1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:49.720
 haired people to brown haired people.

1:00:49.720 --> 1:00:53.360
 It's like she really did not understand why there was an issue.

1:00:53.360 --> 1:00:55.680
 And I thought that's exactly why.

1:00:55.680 --> 1:01:01.520
 Because I know that this is, it's generational, people are raised with it, they have a deep

1:01:01.520 --> 1:01:06.160
 in there, but it's not really right.

1:01:06.160 --> 1:01:07.840
 It's just not right.

1:01:07.840 --> 1:01:15.900
 But if you could just look back to that journey, how difficult is it to make these decisions

1:01:15.900 --> 1:01:16.900
 a principle?

1:01:16.900 --> 1:01:23.280
 So because you have to think about that in order to think about such decisions you yet

1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:25.640
 might still have to make in the future.

1:01:25.640 --> 1:01:29.640
 And I will tell you one thing I did wrong with that and one thing I did right.

1:01:29.640 --> 1:01:36.860
 The thing I did right was I waited until in the communities where people objected to it,

1:01:36.860 --> 1:01:45.040
 I had enough people whose kids had come out so that I had parents of kids who'd come out

1:01:45.040 --> 1:01:50.740
 to refer later on other parents to so that they wouldn't feel like they were the only

1:01:50.740 --> 1:01:51.740
 ones.

1:01:51.740 --> 1:01:55.200
 Because once I announced it, as I thought would happen, a bunch of kids came out and

1:01:55.200 --> 1:01:59.960
 said, now that the rabbi said this, mom, dad, I want you to know I'm gay.

1:01:59.960 --> 1:02:03.320
 And when the parents came to me, I could say, well, listen, you're not alone, this person

1:02:03.320 --> 1:02:04.760
 also you can go to.

1:02:04.760 --> 1:02:05.760
 That I did right.

1:02:05.760 --> 1:02:11.000
 What I did wrong was I don't think the classes were enough and I don't think enough people

1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:12.360
 were prepared.

1:02:12.360 --> 1:02:18.560
 And I think part of the explosion was shock and I should have prepared even more.

1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:25.040
 The words you used to talk about it, the way you thought about it, was it more scholarly

1:02:25.040 --> 1:02:30.760
 in the Jewish tradition or did you go to the feeling thing?

1:02:30.760 --> 1:02:31.760
 No, I went to the feeling.

1:02:31.760 --> 1:02:40.680
 I said, which means respect or honor for God's creations and caring for other human beings

1:02:40.680 --> 1:02:44.920
 and understanding.

1:02:44.920 --> 1:02:51.880
 It wasn't scholarly because I knew that the objections were not scholarly objections.

1:02:51.880 --> 1:02:59.200
 And I had many beautiful and also painful stories as a result, some of which can be

1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:01.320
 told and some of which really can't.

1:03:01.320 --> 1:03:10.360
 But what I tried to impress also on people was how painful it is to not be able to tell

1:03:10.360 --> 1:03:13.740
 the world, even your own parents, who you are.

1:03:13.740 --> 1:03:16.400
 And your sexuality is not a trivial part of who you are.

1:03:16.400 --> 1:03:19.280
 I mean, it's core to people.

1:03:19.280 --> 1:03:22.360
 So it's one of the reasons why I'd evoke such reactions.

1:03:22.360 --> 1:03:28.040
 But I would say to them, the same reason that you're reacting so strongly tells you how

1:03:28.040 --> 1:03:29.040
 strongly...

1:03:29.040 --> 1:03:41.800
 Anyway, it was a very powerful experience and for that I feel good about it.

1:03:41.800 --> 1:03:45.560
 Afterwards, the other thing that I, again, said to my daughter afterwards, after it all

1:03:45.560 --> 1:03:50.720
 died down and after all the bad things were said, I told her the Churchill one said that

1:03:50.720 --> 1:03:53.280
 it's exhilarating to be shot at without result.

1:03:53.280 --> 1:03:58.440
 If you go into a battle and you make it through and you're still okay, that's good.

1:03:58.440 --> 1:04:00.760
 The problem is when you're in the battle, you don't know.

1:04:00.760 --> 1:04:01.960
 No, you don't know.

1:04:01.960 --> 1:04:10.400
 So how did it feel like, I mean, looking back, you've been, to use the word, canceled a couple

1:04:10.400 --> 1:04:11.400
 of times.

1:04:11.400 --> 1:04:17.680
 But I guess when you're dealing with the most difficult of questions, just as a human being,

1:04:17.680 --> 1:04:22.520
 for a community that you really deeply care about, some part of it saying that you have

1:04:22.520 --> 1:04:23.520
 failed.

1:04:23.520 --> 1:04:25.760
 I wasn't canceled the way...

1:04:25.760 --> 1:04:32.080
 I didn't lose my job, didn't lose my home, but I hurt people that I cared about.

1:04:32.080 --> 1:04:33.320
 And that was the hard...

1:04:33.320 --> 1:04:39.960
 I went into this to be someone who brings people together and then I would sit there

1:04:39.960 --> 1:04:46.600
 and do even now, as you're well aware with stuff that's going on now, I sit there and

1:04:46.600 --> 1:04:54.440
 people are really upset at me who I either am or used to be close to.

1:04:54.440 --> 1:05:00.440
 Do those people in time come around?

1:05:00.440 --> 1:05:04.440
 When you look now, because those are real feelings in the moment and we can learn that

1:05:04.440 --> 1:05:10.240
 about social media, people, especially during COVID, there's this intensity of feeling about

1:05:10.240 --> 1:05:11.240
 stuff.

1:05:11.240 --> 1:05:17.360
 And have you learned something about the passing of feeling that turns into wisdom?

1:05:17.360 --> 1:05:18.680
 No question about it.

1:05:18.680 --> 1:05:24.860
 The sermon I gave this Saturday was about how Moses came down the mountain, he saw the

1:05:24.860 --> 1:05:27.660
 golden calf and he broke the tablets.

1:05:27.660 --> 1:05:31.120
 If he'd sat with it for a little while, he probably wouldn't have broken the tablets.

1:05:31.120 --> 1:05:34.440
 But the instant reaction is always anger.

1:05:34.440 --> 1:05:40.160
 And in our age, unfortunately, the instant reaction gets put on social media forever

1:05:40.160 --> 1:05:42.420
 and ever and ever.

1:05:42.420 --> 1:05:46.640
 And by the way, once you've actually said that, it becomes harder to back down.

1:05:46.640 --> 1:05:52.240
 If you keep quiet for a day or two, then you can back down because you haven't put yourself

1:05:52.240 --> 1:05:53.240
 out there.

1:05:53.240 --> 1:05:57.600
 But once you said, this is terrible what you did, it's harder to write and say, I'm sorry,

1:05:57.600 --> 1:05:59.360
 I shouldn't have said that.

1:05:59.360 --> 1:06:08.920
 Yeah, so it almost becomes, I mean, I actually, it's a really powerful statement that the

1:06:08.920 --> 1:06:18.120
 downside of saying something on the internet is that it actually pulls you into this current.

1:06:18.120 --> 1:06:22.440
 You both create the current and it pulls you into it, to where it's actually very hard

1:06:22.440 --> 1:06:23.600
 to escape.

1:06:23.600 --> 1:06:28.400
 So when two days later you feel different, there's a momentum, there's now a tribe of

1:06:28.400 --> 1:06:31.380
 people that feel this way and there's a momentum with it.

1:06:31.380 --> 1:06:34.720
 There's a momentum and also you don't want to betray your own tribe because then people

1:06:34.720 --> 1:06:36.400
 will get upset at you.

1:06:36.400 --> 1:06:42.200
 I really think that a lot of the antagonism is not so much that you don't want to give

1:06:42.200 --> 1:06:45.640
 ground to the people who oppose you, it's that you don't want to break with the people

1:06:45.640 --> 1:06:47.360
 who are behind you.

1:06:47.360 --> 1:06:48.640
 And that's really hard.

1:06:48.640 --> 1:06:54.960
 Can you tell the story of this recent controversy, the sermon you just gave?

1:06:54.960 --> 1:06:56.960
 You went to the Super Bowl.

1:06:56.960 --> 1:07:01.800
 I think a lot of people would relate to this because to me personally, I apologize to anybody

1:07:01.800 --> 1:07:03.080
 who was hurt by this.

1:07:03.080 --> 1:07:06.580
 The absurdity of it is deeply intense.

1:07:06.580 --> 1:07:07.740
 So here's the story.

1:07:07.740 --> 1:07:12.180
 The LA County mandates masking children in school and all of the kids in our school are

1:07:12.180 --> 1:07:15.640
 masked and many of the parents are extremely upset about that.

1:07:15.640 --> 1:07:19.220
 I will just leave that at that.

1:07:19.220 --> 1:07:23.200
 I went to the Super Bowl, there were 70,000 people.

1:07:23.200 --> 1:07:29.640
 Frank Luntz, whom we know was a wonderful guy, gave me a ticket.

1:07:29.640 --> 1:07:35.080
 And so I was at the Super Bowl and I maybe saw two masks among the 70,000 people.

1:07:35.080 --> 1:07:39.080
 I didn't even think about it, which was foolish on my part, no question.

1:07:39.080 --> 1:07:43.200
 I took a picture of myself unmasked at the Super Bowl.

1:07:43.200 --> 1:07:50.440
 And many, many people thought, oh, great, wonderful, glad you're having a good time,

1:07:50.440 --> 1:07:51.440
 so on and so forth.

1:07:51.440 --> 1:07:54.120
 I didn't diminish at all the many people who said that.

1:07:54.120 --> 1:07:55.860
 A lot of people were livid.

1:07:55.860 --> 1:07:56.860
 They were livid.

1:07:56.860 --> 1:08:04.320
 And they weren't, what was instructive about it was they didn't say, nobody wrote me a

1:08:04.320 --> 1:08:08.680
 private note and said, I think that this was a bad idea, you should have thought about

1:08:08.680 --> 1:08:09.680
 this.

1:08:09.680 --> 1:08:10.680
 No.

1:08:10.680 --> 1:08:13.960
 They were, you're a hypocrite, you're a clown, you're an idiot, how could you do this?

1:08:13.960 --> 1:08:15.040
 This is a disgrace.

1:08:15.040 --> 1:08:16.400
 This is that kind of thing.

1:08:16.400 --> 1:08:17.400
 They say that publicly.

1:08:17.400 --> 1:08:18.400
 Oh, yeah.

1:08:18.400 --> 1:08:22.160
 And on my Instagram, you can still see I left the remarks up because I really thought it

1:08:22.160 --> 1:08:23.240
 was important.

1:08:23.240 --> 1:08:28.160
 If I started, I only deleted the really vile comments because I thought that shouldn't

1:08:28.160 --> 1:08:29.160
 stay up.

1:08:29.160 --> 1:08:33.600
 But I left them up because I thought like people should see and I should remind myself

1:08:33.600 --> 1:08:34.600
 what I did.

1:08:34.600 --> 1:08:37.760
 And I didn't want to just delete the picture as though it didn't happen because it did

1:08:37.760 --> 1:08:39.880
 happen and I did do it.

1:08:39.880 --> 1:08:41.720
 And I felt terrible about that.

1:08:41.720 --> 1:08:46.840
 And I felt terrible that I had, not about, I mean, the comments, believe me, weren't

1:08:46.840 --> 1:08:47.840
 pleasant.

1:08:47.840 --> 1:08:49.120
 I didn't like it.

1:08:49.120 --> 1:08:50.120
 Nobody likes it.

1:08:50.120 --> 1:08:53.680
 But I felt worse that I had hurt all these people that I'm close to.

1:08:53.680 --> 1:08:56.840
 And I defended all these people who were really upset that their kids were wearing masks and

1:08:56.840 --> 1:09:00.080
 now their kid says, why doesn't a rabbi have to wear a mask?

1:09:00.080 --> 1:09:03.240
 Well, first of all, it is tough to be a rabbi.

1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:11.040
 I mean, the masks to me symbolize these kinds of discussions, symbolize not necessarily

1:09:11.040 --> 1:09:15.540
 the issues at hand, but the intensity of feeling and people are really struggling.

1:09:15.540 --> 1:09:22.200
 People are in pain, they're lonely, the uncertainty of it, you don't know who to trust.

1:09:22.200 --> 1:09:23.200
 Everything is under question.

1:09:23.200 --> 1:09:28.040
 The institutions, even the scientific institutions, and there's all these conspiracy theories

1:09:28.040 --> 1:09:29.040
 flying around.

1:09:29.040 --> 1:09:30.360
 You don't know who to believe.

1:09:30.360 --> 1:09:34.640
 And there's people just yelling at each other and politics is weaved into this whole thing

1:09:34.640 --> 1:09:35.640
 in some messy way.

1:09:35.640 --> 1:09:42.160
 And you're just getting, I mean, honestly, it's just like legit, simple, just frustration,

1:09:42.160 --> 1:09:50.120
 going back to marriage of just hanging out with the kids and your wife, husband, just

1:09:50.120 --> 1:09:54.220
 distressed, just building up over time, no release.

1:09:54.220 --> 1:09:58.560
 And just people want to tell you when the rabbi is not wearing a mask, even though it's

1:09:58.560 --> 1:10:03.800
 at the damn Super Bowl, maybe you want to comment on the Super Bowl part, which is awesome.

1:10:03.800 --> 1:10:09.240
 But it released clearly a dam of all the kinds of feelings that you're talking about.

1:10:09.240 --> 1:10:11.600
 So how do you then write a sermon?

1:10:11.600 --> 1:10:18.940
 So what I did was I didn't answer on social media because I knew that I wouldn't be able

1:10:18.940 --> 1:10:22.780
 to formulate it the way I wanted, and I was going to wait, and I was going to be able

1:10:22.780 --> 1:10:26.600
 to give a longer, I mean, the sermon is 15 minutes, not that long.

1:10:26.600 --> 1:10:33.180
 But I wanted to be able to give a longer answer as opposed to a tweet.

1:10:33.180 --> 1:10:41.080
 And so I was really, I mean, I tried to make two points during the sermon, and also I published

1:10:41.080 --> 1:10:43.280
 the text of it, which I never do because I never speak from a text.

1:10:43.280 --> 1:10:46.420
 I always speak from either notes or not even from notes.

1:10:46.420 --> 1:10:49.380
 But this time I thought it was really important that I have a text out there too so that people

1:10:49.380 --> 1:10:53.320
 could actually look over it.

1:10:53.320 --> 1:10:57.600
 And I just wanted to make two points, one of which was that I really feel terrible.

1:10:57.600 --> 1:11:03.600
 And I did, that all these people were hurt and that there is this contradiction between

1:11:03.600 --> 1:11:05.960
 the way I acted and the way they want me to act.

1:11:05.960 --> 1:11:10.240
 And I also think, by the way, I didn't speak about this, but I also think that there are

1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:14.100
 some people who just don't like the idea of a rabbi being at the Super Bowl.

1:11:14.100 --> 1:11:17.400
 It's like you're supposed to be doing rabbi stuff.

1:11:17.400 --> 1:11:19.840
 So I understand that too.

1:11:19.840 --> 1:11:20.840
 But then...

1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:21.840
 Yeah.

1:11:21.840 --> 1:11:27.600
 But rabbi at the Super Bowl, I mean, you are also, I hate to say it, but there's a rock

1:11:27.600 --> 1:11:32.220
 star nature to you talking to Christopher Hitchens, contending with ideas, inspiring

1:11:32.220 --> 1:11:33.760
 so many other minds.

1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:36.160
 I mean, there's an educational aspect to this.

1:11:36.160 --> 1:11:37.160
 I appreciate that.

1:11:37.160 --> 1:11:38.160
 It's making ideas cool.

1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:40.320
 I mean, that's a very powerful...

1:11:40.320 --> 1:11:42.720
 I mean, that is also the job of a rabbi.

1:11:42.720 --> 1:11:45.440
 You're not just supposed to do rabbi stuff, it's to educate the spot.

1:11:45.440 --> 1:11:49.200
 Yeah, but I didn't do so much of that at the game.

1:11:49.200 --> 1:11:54.120
 So nonetheless.

1:11:54.120 --> 1:12:00.880
 But the second part of it was I said that we have to be able to express our anger and

1:12:00.880 --> 1:12:03.000
 disappointment better than this.

1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:04.840
 You just have to.

1:12:04.840 --> 1:12:08.960
 In part because it doesn't get you the result that you want.

1:12:08.960 --> 1:12:16.840
 I mean, when you scream at someone, that's not gonna get them to realize what they did.

1:12:16.840 --> 1:12:23.640
 And the most painful moment of it was this letter that I got from a Christian pastor

1:12:23.640 --> 1:12:27.500
 who said, you know, I always admired the Jews so much, I can't believe they could be so

1:12:27.500 --> 1:12:30.240
 cruel and especially to a rabbi.

1:12:30.240 --> 1:12:36.960
 And I thought that's not how I want my congregation to be perceived in the world.

1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:46.240
 And by the way, some of them were from my congregation, some many were not from my congregation.

1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:51.680
 And I spoke about what you talked about, which is that I mentioned before that Moses broke

1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:54.260
 those tablets coming down the mountain.

1:12:54.260 --> 1:12:57.340
 And the Torah doesn't say what happened to the tablets, but the rabbis do.

1:12:57.340 --> 1:13:01.520
 They say that they were carried together in the ark with the second set that was intact.

1:13:01.520 --> 1:13:04.440
 And that we all have brokenness, communities and individuals.

1:13:04.440 --> 1:13:10.000
 We have brokenness and especially now, and we have to learn how to give each other space

1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:14.760
 to be mistaken and broken and hurt and all of that.

1:13:14.760 --> 1:13:18.120
 And the cool thing when you give people that space, you feel better.

1:13:18.120 --> 1:13:24.080
 I mean, you for caring for the community, it feels better when you show empathy and

1:13:24.080 --> 1:13:26.440
 compassion and kindness on the internet.

1:13:26.440 --> 1:13:29.080
 You'll actually feel better a week from now.

1:13:29.080 --> 1:13:36.000
 You'll feel much worse if you make some kind of a negative statement of principle on the

1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:37.000
 internet.

1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.480
 It's almost just exclusively true.

1:13:39.480 --> 1:13:45.140
 So if you care about feeling good, just be kind first, be empathetic first.

1:13:45.140 --> 1:13:46.760
 Almost always the case.

1:13:46.760 --> 1:13:48.020
 Exactly so.

1:13:48.020 --> 1:13:53.460
 So it's, I mean, it settled down a lot.

1:13:53.460 --> 1:14:00.840
 The most, really the single best reaction, there are people and you can, again, you can

1:14:00.840 --> 1:14:04.740
 go on social media, you can see all the criticisms and so on and so forth.

1:14:04.740 --> 1:14:10.300
 But the single best reaction I got was from a man who came up to me right after the sermon

1:14:10.300 --> 1:14:12.760
 and said, I have four words for you.

1:14:12.760 --> 1:14:20.120
 And I thought, oh no, I got to confess, I said, I said what?

1:14:20.120 --> 1:14:23.920
 He said, you changed my mind.

1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:25.160
 And I thought, wow.

1:14:25.160 --> 1:14:30.000
 And I, I said to him, you know, that's so, it's like to take so much courage to come

1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:32.040
 up to somebody and say that in front of them.

1:14:32.040 --> 1:14:34.160
 And I was so grateful.

1:14:34.160 --> 1:14:37.800
 And the other thing that it tells me is, look, I've been the rabbi of that congregation for

1:14:37.800 --> 1:14:41.480
 25 years and I taught 10 years before that, I've been a rabbi for a long time.

1:14:41.480 --> 1:14:43.780
 I still, I still have a lot to learn.

1:14:43.780 --> 1:14:48.520
 We talked a little bit about the difference between Judaism, Christianity and Islam, cause

1:14:48.520 --> 1:14:56.120
 you maybe talk about the difference between the Torah, the Bible and the Koran.

1:14:56.120 --> 1:15:03.240
 So there's the Hebrew Bible is actually what's called a step canon.

1:15:03.240 --> 1:15:06.200
 That is there are the five books of the Torah.

1:15:06.200 --> 1:15:09.040
 Then there are books of history and the prophets.

1:15:09.040 --> 1:15:18.260
 So books like Samuel, Kings, Judges, and then the prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, Ezekiel,

1:15:18.260 --> 1:15:19.560
 and so on.

1:15:19.560 --> 1:15:21.880
 And then there are what are called the writings.

1:15:21.880 --> 1:15:29.120
 The writings are books like Psalms, Proverbs, Job, the Migilot, which are Esther, Daniel,

1:15:29.120 --> 1:15:34.360
 all of those, all of those books, Ecclesiastes.

1:15:34.360 --> 1:15:40.400
 So in Hebrew, it's called the Tanakh, Torah, Neviim, Ketuvim, the Torah, the prophets and

1:15:40.400 --> 1:15:41.400
 the writings.

1:15:41.400 --> 1:15:43.660
 And that is the Hebrew Bible.

1:15:43.660 --> 1:15:47.580
 Sometimes that's also called the Torah, just to be confusing, but really the Torah generally

1:15:47.580 --> 1:15:49.880
 refers to the five books.

1:15:49.880 --> 1:15:56.200
 Then there is the New Testament, which the Jews don't recognize as a sacred book.

1:15:56.200 --> 1:15:59.680
 They recognize it as the book of another religion.

1:15:59.680 --> 1:16:04.840
 And I sometimes say to Christians, in order for them to really grasp this, Jesus has as

1:16:04.840 --> 1:16:09.860
 much religious significance to Judaism as Muhammad has to Christianity.

1:16:09.860 --> 1:16:14.200
 That is Jesus, although Jewish, became the founder of another religion.

1:16:14.200 --> 1:16:19.460
 And for Judaism, that's not only in as much as Christians and Jews have had a lot of interactions,

1:16:19.460 --> 1:16:22.940
 but religiously, Jesus has no significance.

1:16:22.940 --> 1:16:25.680
 Said many beautiful things, said some things I don't like so much.

1:16:25.680 --> 1:16:26.680
 Like what?

1:16:26.680 --> 1:16:27.680
 Like what?

1:16:27.680 --> 1:16:28.680
 Leave your father and mother and follow me.

1:16:28.680 --> 1:16:32.480
 I don't like that as a religious model.

1:16:32.480 --> 1:16:38.980
 Now Christians will say that I don't understand that, but that's because Christians like Jews

1:16:38.980 --> 1:16:42.120
 interpret their texts different ways at different times.

1:16:42.120 --> 1:16:48.800
 So anyway, the Koran, which I know less well.

1:16:48.800 --> 1:16:51.740
 I have read it, but I know it less well than I know the New Testament and certainly less

1:16:51.740 --> 1:17:02.440
 well obviously than I know the Hebrew Bible, is in some ways a, parts of it are, I don't

1:17:02.440 --> 1:17:06.460
 say this word, I say this word because I can't find a better descriptive word, but Muslims

1:17:06.460 --> 1:17:11.320
 will not accept this, okay, is a takeoff on the Torah in some things.

1:17:11.320 --> 1:17:14.540
 That is, it's the same stories as the Torah, but they're different.

1:17:14.540 --> 1:17:19.300
 Now Jews will say, and I being a Jew will say this, that that's because Muhammad heard

1:17:19.300 --> 1:17:24.240
 those stories from Jews and also heard Midrashim, which are rabbinic interpretations of those

1:17:24.240 --> 1:17:26.700
 stories and he wrote those down.

1:17:26.700 --> 1:17:30.940
 Muslims will say, no, the Jews got it wrong and Muhammad came along to correct the record

1:17:30.940 --> 1:17:32.520
 and tell the real story.

1:17:32.520 --> 1:17:37.680
 But they're all telling the story of the same thing.

1:17:37.680 --> 1:17:43.360
 The Hebrew Bible part, the Abrahamic part, they all tell the story of the same characters,

1:17:43.360 --> 1:17:49.160
 but tell them, obviously Christians accept the Hebrew Bible as sacred scripture.

1:17:49.160 --> 1:17:55.680
 The Muslims retell many of the stories in the Bible.

1:17:55.680 --> 1:18:00.740
 What is common to all of them is that all of them are monotheistic faiths.

1:18:00.740 --> 1:18:06.160
 Now in Christianity, that's more complicated because of the Trinity, but as Christianity

1:18:06.160 --> 1:18:12.040
 has developed over time, it clearly presents itself and thinks of itself and is a monotheistic

1:18:12.040 --> 1:18:13.040
 faith as well.

1:18:13.040 --> 1:18:17.180
 What's the role of the word in each of these religions, in the scriptures?

1:18:17.180 --> 1:18:23.400
 So in terms of, so first of all, the role of oral traditions, the power of the exactness

1:18:23.400 --> 1:18:28.920
 of the words in the scripture, does it differ or is it really within the communities it

1:18:28.920 --> 1:18:29.920
 differs?

1:18:29.920 --> 1:18:37.200
 Just because in Christianity, the words are not all the words of Jesus.

1:18:37.200 --> 1:18:39.760
 They're the words of Jesus's disciples.

1:18:39.760 --> 1:18:43.920
 None of the books of the New Testament were written by people who met Jesus in person.

1:18:43.920 --> 1:18:49.080
 So they're different and therefore, and also we don't even know sometimes the original

1:18:49.080 --> 1:18:54.900
 language of some of the things in the New Testament.

1:18:54.900 --> 1:18:59.520
 In the Bible, and I understand in the Koran, but I'll speak for the Hebrew Bible, the

1:18:59.520 --> 1:19:06.320
 idea is that that's Lashon HaKodesh, that's sacred language, and Hebrew, that's the language

1:19:06.320 --> 1:19:10.900
 according to the tradition that God actually spoke to Moses, and therefore the exact words

1:19:10.900 --> 1:19:15.000
 are infinitely interpretable and meaningful.

1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:22.120
 But the words are spoken by, written by Moses, and the same with Muhammad, but from memory

1:19:22.120 --> 1:19:23.120
 or no?

1:19:23.120 --> 1:19:24.800
 There are different theories.

1:19:24.800 --> 1:19:27.360
 I won't speak for Muhammad, you should ask.

1:19:27.360 --> 1:19:31.280
 I don't want to get another religious tradition wrong.

1:19:31.280 --> 1:19:35.620
 In Judaism, the words are written by Moses at God's dictation, basically.

1:19:35.620 --> 1:19:36.880
 That's the traditional view.

1:19:36.880 --> 1:19:40.160
 There are other views that I'm happy to go into if you want to, but basically that's

1:19:40.160 --> 1:19:41.160
 the traditional view.

1:19:41.160 --> 1:19:44.640
 So it's pretty close to the words of God.

1:19:44.640 --> 1:19:50.840
 What makes Judaism and Christianity different is Christianity has an ideal life.

1:19:50.840 --> 1:19:53.520
 Judaism doesn't have an ideal life.

1:19:53.520 --> 1:19:55.580
 Judaism has an ideal book.

1:19:55.580 --> 1:20:01.360
 So the holidays of Christianity are events in the life of God, God's birth, God's death

1:20:01.360 --> 1:20:03.100
 and resurrection.

1:20:03.100 --> 1:20:08.520
 In Judaism, the holidays are all events in the life of the people, like the liberation

1:20:08.520 --> 1:20:13.720
 from slavery, or in the people's relationship to God, like Yom Kippur, which is a day of

1:20:13.720 --> 1:20:15.020
 atonement.

1:20:15.020 --> 1:20:19.000
 But there are no holidays in Judaism that are events in the life of God because in Judaism

1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:21.480
 God doesn't have a biography.

1:20:21.480 --> 1:20:24.400
 God is eternal, and God never came to earth.

1:20:24.400 --> 1:20:29.000
 And those events carry with them traditions and rules that you're to follow.

1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:30.000
 Yes.

1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:35.960
 And you mention on one such event in Scripture, yet another time you walked through the fire,

1:20:35.960 --> 1:20:38.360
 which is with Exodus.

1:20:38.360 --> 1:20:41.080
 That was the first.

1:20:41.080 --> 1:20:44.160
 And you never forget the first.

1:20:44.160 --> 1:20:47.680
 One of several controversies.

1:20:47.680 --> 1:20:53.460
 You spoke 20 years ago, 21 years ago now at Passover and said that, quote, the way the

1:20:53.460 --> 1:20:59.280
 Bible describes the Exodus is not the way it happened, if it happened at all.

1:20:59.280 --> 1:21:03.640
 So first of all, what is Exodus, and what really happened?

1:21:03.640 --> 1:21:07.000
 Exodus is the liberation of the Jews from Egypt, and it is the central story of the

1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:08.800
 Jewish tradition.

1:21:08.800 --> 1:21:16.360
 And as I've said numerous times in various places, I believe that it's based on a historical

1:21:16.360 --> 1:21:17.360
 kernel.

1:21:17.360 --> 1:21:20.320
 I think Richard Eliot Friedman may have gotten this right in his book Exodus.

1:21:20.320 --> 1:21:27.520
 It may have been the Levites who left Israel.

1:21:27.520 --> 1:21:30.360
 But the Bible is not a book of history.

1:21:30.360 --> 1:21:37.420
 I don't believe that there were 10 plagues and a split sea and 600,000 men, which makes

1:21:37.420 --> 1:21:42.200
 about 2 million people, who actually, if there were 2 million people, would stretch all the

1:21:42.200 --> 1:21:48.740
 way from Israel to Egypt alone, were liberated from Egypt.

1:21:48.740 --> 1:21:53.140
 And my point in that sermon was not actually to convince people that it didn't happen.

1:21:53.140 --> 1:21:59.520
 My point in that sermon was to convince people that the historicity of the Exodus is not

1:21:59.520 --> 1:22:01.680
 the basis of the faith of the Jewish people.

1:22:01.680 --> 1:22:03.720
 Well, what does the word historicity mean?

1:22:03.720 --> 1:22:05.400
 In other words, the factuality of it.

1:22:05.400 --> 1:22:06.880
 It can be true without being factual.

1:22:06.880 --> 1:22:10.280
 So you're not supposed to read it as fact?

1:22:10.280 --> 1:22:12.680
 Well, I don't read it as fact.

1:22:12.680 --> 1:22:13.840
 I don't read it as a history book.

1:22:13.840 --> 1:22:18.440
 I said, look, I was talking, again, to a congregation that had many Iranians.

1:22:18.440 --> 1:22:22.720
 I said, you experienced the truth of the Exodus in your own life.

1:22:22.720 --> 1:22:26.160
 There was a regime that wanted to destroy you.

1:22:26.160 --> 1:22:30.640
 And you miraculously escaped before it did.

1:22:30.640 --> 1:22:40.000
 And so a myth is something that may not have happened, but is always happening.

1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:42.400
 And that's what I would say about the Exodus story.

1:22:42.400 --> 1:22:47.080
 It's not about whether, in fact, there was a killing of the firstborn.

1:22:47.080 --> 1:22:49.260
 It's about, does God deliver?

1:22:49.260 --> 1:22:51.120
 Did God deliver the Jews in ancient times?

1:22:51.120 --> 1:22:52.960
 Does God deliver people in modern times?

1:22:52.960 --> 1:22:57.480
 And that's what the issue is.

1:22:57.480 --> 1:23:02.920
 And to me, the issue of faith is much deeper than the issue of fact.

1:23:02.920 --> 1:23:06.680
 I wouldn't look to the Torah for my science either.

1:23:06.680 --> 1:23:15.480
 What are the limits of science in terms of, what can science not tell us that the Torah

1:23:15.480 --> 1:23:17.480
 can in terms of wisdom?

1:23:17.480 --> 1:23:22.280
 So the historicity, the facts of things, okay.

1:23:22.280 --> 1:23:29.720
 If the Torah is much more than that, like you said, myth is not something that happened,

1:23:29.720 --> 1:23:32.000
 but something that is always happening.

1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:39.680
 And so presumably it's interacting with the environment of the day to generate wisdom.

1:23:39.680 --> 1:23:42.080
 So you can live a life by Torah.

1:23:42.080 --> 1:23:46.000
 I don't think you can live a life by biology.

1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:53.080
 You can live a life that is informed by the values of the tradition of Judaism.

1:23:53.080 --> 1:24:01.540
 And those values, by the way, what science does is it contributes factuality to the conversation

1:24:01.540 --> 1:24:04.760
 and also changes the reality around us.

1:24:04.760 --> 1:24:12.900
 So when you study Talmud on your iPhone, you're still, I mean, it changes the atmosphere in

1:24:12.900 --> 1:24:20.620
 which you do it, but the wisdom and the life guidance and the connection to transcendence

1:24:20.620 --> 1:24:24.440
 is something that science doesn't give.

1:24:24.440 --> 1:24:31.040
 So if we now step into returning to our friend Sam Harris and step into this weird place

1:24:31.040 --> 1:24:35.320
 of science, and you talked about this, where the kind of the current assumption of science

1:24:35.320 --> 1:24:39.280
 is it's a materialistic one.

1:24:39.280 --> 1:24:44.780
 So for me, obviously AI person, this whole mind thing is fascinating, like what the heck

1:24:44.780 --> 1:24:47.040
 is going on up there?

1:24:47.040 --> 1:24:49.960
 So how do you explain consciousness?

1:24:49.960 --> 1:24:51.800
 How do you explain free will?

1:24:51.800 --> 1:24:58.340
 Do you think, first of all, do you think we have a free will and if so, what is it?

1:24:58.340 --> 1:25:05.180
 This is where we had the debate earlier that I mentioned with Hitchens where I think actually

1:25:05.180 --> 1:25:11.400
 neither he nor the moderator understood what I was saying, which is I'm sure my inability

1:25:11.400 --> 1:25:12.400
 to express it.

1:25:12.400 --> 1:25:17.360
 But he was very focused and delivered on the humor and the wit.

1:25:17.360 --> 1:25:18.360
 Yes.

1:25:18.360 --> 1:25:26.120
 But what I was trying to say is if we're entirely biological creatures, if we didn't choose

1:25:26.120 --> 1:25:31.720
 our genetics and we didn't choose our environment, then there is no space for free choice.

1:25:31.720 --> 1:25:33.280
 I don't understand where it comes in.

1:25:33.280 --> 1:25:37.120
 And I kept asking them that question but didn't get an answer because I don't think there

1:25:37.120 --> 1:25:38.120
 is an answer.

1:25:38.120 --> 1:25:43.520
 I think if you're a thoroughgoing materialist, free will is impossible.

1:25:43.520 --> 1:25:48.720
 There could be randomness, but randomness is not free will, it's randomness.

1:25:48.720 --> 1:25:56.840
 I think you need a spiritual nonmaterial belief in order to get free will and that's why I

1:25:56.840 --> 1:25:57.840
 believe in free will.

1:25:57.840 --> 1:26:01.400
 Yeah, you were talking about sort of, yeah, and actually the moderator totally missed

1:26:01.400 --> 1:26:05.000
 your point about the glass of water and basically how, what's the difference.

1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:10.680
 So do you, free will, because you could also, if it fits into the materialistic picture,

1:26:10.680 --> 1:26:13.920
 it could be just a convenient, useful quirk.

1:26:13.920 --> 1:26:15.320
 You would understand this better than I would.

1:26:15.320 --> 1:26:20.360
 I don't understand how it could be a convenient quirk materialistic, I don't understand how

1:26:20.360 --> 1:26:21.360
 to explain it.

1:26:21.360 --> 1:26:25.840
 Well, no, there's, you know, if you study perception, there's all these kinds of illusions.

1:26:25.840 --> 1:26:32.360
 We are, our mind plays tricks on us to make our life easier, more efficient and survive

1:26:32.360 --> 1:26:34.020
 better and all those kinds of things.

1:26:34.020 --> 1:26:37.360
 And so free, the feeling like we have a choice.

1:26:37.360 --> 1:26:38.360
 Oh, that could be an illusion.

1:26:38.360 --> 1:26:39.360
 Could be an illusion.

1:26:39.360 --> 1:26:40.360
 That I understand.

1:26:40.360 --> 1:26:41.360
 Right.

1:26:41.360 --> 1:26:43.080
 But, but actual free choice, free will.

1:26:43.080 --> 1:26:45.560
 I don't see where you get it if you're a materialist.

1:26:45.560 --> 1:26:49.080
 I think you have to have a spiritual component.

1:26:49.080 --> 1:26:53.120
 By the way, this, I think this is also, I think Sam would agree with this.

1:26:53.120 --> 1:26:58.360
 I think he wrote about not having, not having free will.

1:26:58.360 --> 1:27:05.760
 And I think if you don't have a God and you don't have a soul, that free will is a logical

1:27:05.760 --> 1:27:06.760
 impossibility.

1:27:06.760 --> 1:27:14.220
 But Sam, which is fascinating, it's not just that free will is an illusion, but the illusion

1:27:14.220 --> 1:27:19.280
 of free will is an illusion, meaning there's not, we don't even experience anything like

1:27:19.280 --> 1:27:20.280
 it.

1:27:20.280 --> 1:27:21.280
 There's no illusion.

1:27:21.280 --> 1:27:24.760
 We're like, it's not even honest to be talking about it.

1:27:24.760 --> 1:27:29.400
 We're just, we are like the, the, the, the, the currents in the river or something that

1:27:29.400 --> 1:27:30.720
 you were comparing it to the glass.

1:27:30.720 --> 1:27:31.720
 We are just like that glass.

1:27:31.720 --> 1:27:32.720
 Right.

1:27:32.720 --> 1:27:35.400
 So I don't know what we're going on about with this whole free will thing.

1:27:35.400 --> 1:27:41.960
 I mean, to you is the free will, the I that the young person is born with, is that somehow

1:27:41.960 --> 1:27:43.960
 fundamental to religion?

1:27:43.960 --> 1:27:46.280
 I think it's fundamental to Judaism.

1:27:46.280 --> 1:27:55.160
 I think that the, the idea is that you are the custodian of your soul.

1:27:55.160 --> 1:28:04.480
 And even though I grant that there's a certain over emphasis in modern society on the individuality

1:28:04.480 --> 1:28:15.560
 of the soul, that is we are more interconnected than I think we're, we believe, still, yeah,

1:28:15.560 --> 1:28:20.080
 the I, the idea that every human being is an image of God, that, I mean, that the human

1:28:20.080 --> 1:28:22.960
 being in the Torah is, is created singly.

1:28:22.960 --> 1:28:26.800
 And again, do I really believe there was an Adam and an Eve and a garden of Eden?

1:28:26.800 --> 1:28:33.340
 No, not literally, but I think that it's, it expresses a deep truth about human life.

1:28:33.340 --> 1:28:38.240
 And tied into this is the subject of experience of things, which we call consciousness.

1:28:38.240 --> 1:28:45.960
 I mean, this is the most fascinating and inexplicable discussion.

1:28:45.960 --> 1:28:50.920
 And again, this is a discussion I've had, I privileged to have with Daniel Dennett and

1:28:50.920 --> 1:28:58.100
 could not make any, as you can imagine, any headway on my, but he was delightful and brilliant

1:28:58.100 --> 1:29:00.520
 to talk to.

1:29:00.520 --> 1:29:05.880
 I, for me, consciousness is a real thing.

1:29:05.880 --> 1:29:11.760
 I don't know if it is, I mean, I kind of like the pan psych, psychists view that there's

1:29:11.760 --> 1:29:18.140
 an element of consciousness in everything that that's constitutive of reality.

1:29:18.140 --> 1:29:24.300
 But I don't, I'm not wedded to it, but I think that it's, it exists in different degrees

1:29:24.300 --> 1:29:26.520
 in all sentient creatures.

1:29:26.520 --> 1:29:31.800
 I think that anybody who has a pet knows that they have some kind of consciousness.

1:29:31.800 --> 1:29:32.800
 Except cats.

1:29:32.800 --> 1:29:37.200
 I'm not going to, I, since I don't have cats or dogs, I'm not going to.

1:29:37.200 --> 1:29:39.360
 This is another reason people would be outraged.

1:29:39.360 --> 1:29:40.360
 I said it.

1:29:40.360 --> 1:29:44.240
 Well, I happen to be allergic to both, but I'm very fond of animals.

1:29:44.240 --> 1:29:52.880
 The thing that so perplexes me about this and, and is the denial of the reality of consciousness

1:29:52.880 --> 1:29:57.480
 from people who are fully aware that they're conscious.

1:29:57.480 --> 1:30:02.880
 I don't know how you divest yourself of the most present quality of being a person in

1:30:02.880 --> 1:30:07.480
 your discussions about what it is to be a person.

1:30:07.480 --> 1:30:10.080
 We just don't really have a good sense of the alternative.

1:30:10.080 --> 1:30:13.120
 And so you can kind of divest yourself in that way.

1:30:13.120 --> 1:30:14.820
 Well, maybe everything is like this.

1:30:14.820 --> 1:30:20.320
 Maybe we're trying, we're overdramatizing this whole thing and we're like every, everybody,

1:30:20.320 --> 1:30:26.880
 every, it seems like every living thing, perhaps everything period thinks that it's the center

1:30:26.880 --> 1:30:27.880
 of the universe.

1:30:27.880 --> 1:30:28.880
 Right.

1:30:28.880 --> 1:30:32.200
 And so here we are telling ourselves these dramatic, big stories about us being special

1:30:32.200 --> 1:30:33.560
 and so on.

1:30:33.560 --> 1:30:38.640
 And maybe we need to have a little bit more humility, both about the uncertainty and about

1:30:38.640 --> 1:30:40.000
 our place in the whole.

1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:44.680
 Any statement you make about something like consciousness has, I think, a sort of equal

1:30:44.680 --> 1:30:46.720
 level of humility.

1:30:46.720 --> 1:30:51.760
 Your saying that, you know, we don't have it is as not you Lex, but you person saying

1:30:51.760 --> 1:30:55.400
 we don't have it is as intellectually arrogant as my saying we do.

1:30:55.400 --> 1:31:03.300
 So I think for me, humility comes in, in admitting that we really, really have just the tiniest

1:31:03.300 --> 1:31:09.960
 part of the puzzle and, and, and as you get older, at least my experience has been not

1:31:09.960 --> 1:31:14.200
 that you get more answers, but that you just see a bigger puzzle.

1:31:14.200 --> 1:31:19.720
 So to me, there's less, so the questions are fascinating, but there's also an engineering

1:31:19.720 --> 1:31:21.360
 practical question.

1:31:21.360 --> 1:31:29.360
 And perhaps I'll ask you a religious one too on this point to return back to robots.

1:31:29.360 --> 1:31:35.320
 So how to engineer consciousness, or I'll just even ask you a very simple question,

1:31:35.320 --> 1:31:44.920
 which is when you have robots that exhibit the capacity to suffer, I found in myself

1:31:44.920 --> 1:31:49.440
 as a human, when I see that, I, I feel something.

1:31:49.440 --> 1:31:54.560
 Exhibit the capacity to suffer, or they exhibit behaviors that evoke in you a sense that they

1:31:54.560 --> 1:31:55.560
 are suffering.

1:31:55.560 --> 1:31:57.520
 Those aren't the same things.

1:31:57.520 --> 1:32:01.800
 For my, from an observation perspective, they sure as heck seem similar.

1:32:01.800 --> 1:32:03.360
 You think they're feeling pain?

1:32:03.360 --> 1:32:08.280
 I don't know what the, I'm observing pain.

1:32:08.280 --> 1:32:09.280
 Okay.

1:32:09.280 --> 1:32:14.960
 It's like when I watch a movie and there's people on screen, some, some of them are dressed

1:32:14.960 --> 1:32:15.960
 like Batman.

1:32:15.960 --> 1:32:19.720
 But I, but you can make the distinction.

1:32:19.720 --> 1:32:26.200
 Like if I have a doll and I bend the doll over and it makes a sad face, I know that

1:32:26.200 --> 1:32:31.680
 that doll is not actually in pain, even though I am observing pain.

1:32:31.680 --> 1:32:33.520
 So the question, what's that?

1:32:33.520 --> 1:32:42.160
 What the question is when the doll becomes able to remember things about you, David,

1:32:42.160 --> 1:32:50.560
 about the experiences you shared, it is able to speak and make you feel like there's an

1:32:50.560 --> 1:32:51.680
 actual relationship.

1:32:51.680 --> 1:32:57.800
 So that's what I'm asking is at what point do you believe that the, and I know that this

1:32:57.800 --> 1:33:01.320
 is an impossible question, but at what point do you believe that there is a consciousness

1:33:01.320 --> 1:33:09.040
 in there as opposed to just an extraordinary, I mean, like when I play chess against a computer

1:33:09.040 --> 1:33:16.840
 and it beats me, I'm embarrassed even though the computer doesn't, I don't think the computer

1:33:16.840 --> 1:33:20.640
 is going out, you idiot, but it feels that way.

1:33:20.640 --> 1:33:24.840
 But there is some part of me that says, okay, I know that this computer doesn't actually

1:33:24.840 --> 1:33:26.680
 know who I am or care who I am.

1:33:26.680 --> 1:33:28.960
 It just knows how to move the pieces.

1:33:28.960 --> 1:33:34.160
 So at what point do you, I mean, you're giving me instances, it speaks, it does this, it

1:33:34.160 --> 1:33:38.480
 does this, but at what point does that for you cross the threshold into it's actually

1:33:38.480 --> 1:33:39.780
 a sentient being?

1:33:39.780 --> 1:33:43.000
 I think the question is whether there is a threshold that could be crossed.

1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:44.000
 Right.

1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:45.000
 That's one question.

1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:48.280
 And I can answer this because I think it's different from person to person, but the chess

1:33:48.280 --> 1:33:54.920
 engine is not at all trying to cross that threshold.

1:33:54.920 --> 1:33:56.720
 Let's just start there.

1:33:56.720 --> 1:34:06.000
 And to me, the personalization, which is what's the difference, like a friend that you meet,

1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:12.120
 you've shared all these memories and the way they look at you will convey in the things

1:34:12.120 --> 1:34:17.200
 they say will convey that they've shared those memories with you.

1:34:17.200 --> 1:34:22.600
 They'll be able to speak in a shared humor and the language, but really the memories

1:34:22.600 --> 1:34:25.920
 is the big one of having gone through things together.

1:34:25.920 --> 1:34:33.920
 I think I would have more and more trouble, for example, turning off a system that I've

1:34:33.920 --> 1:34:40.840
 been through things with, like, and by turning off, I mean, delete all of its memory.

1:34:40.840 --> 1:34:47.320
 If me and the toaster have gone through a bunch of dramatic events and that toaster

1:34:47.320 --> 1:34:52.300
 remembers, there's a certain level to where like, it's just me and the toaster in this

1:34:52.300 --> 1:34:54.180
 together at this point.

1:34:54.180 --> 1:34:58.280
 And just to talk about sentience, I don't know, but you know.

1:34:58.280 --> 1:34:59.280
 I don't know.

1:34:59.280 --> 1:35:03.360
 It's according to the scripture, can't live by bread alone.

1:35:03.360 --> 1:35:09.640
 But I would, I mean, I know that there's no way to determine this, but it's still about

1:35:09.640 --> 1:35:11.120
 what you feel.

1:35:11.120 --> 1:35:12.120
 Yes.

1:35:12.120 --> 1:35:15.160
 But isn't that what human relations are also though?

1:35:15.160 --> 1:35:16.160
 Yes, but.

1:35:16.160 --> 1:35:18.120
 But we make each other feel.

1:35:18.120 --> 1:35:23.160
 But it's true that I have the assumption that you feel somewhat like I do.

1:35:23.160 --> 1:35:28.080
 I mean, obviously I don't, you know, and that could be illusion and I don't know.

1:35:28.080 --> 1:35:34.240
 And I know that you don't feel exactly as I do.

1:35:34.240 --> 1:35:39.480
 But I think we have a long, at least to me, we have a long way to go before the detached

1:35:39.480 --> 1:35:41.240
 part of our brains.

1:35:41.240 --> 1:35:45.880
 That is the objective evaluating part, as opposed to the emotive, it feels this way

1:35:45.880 --> 1:35:49.800
 part, believe that that machine has consciousness.

1:35:49.800 --> 1:35:55.200
 I think it's at least without arriving conclusions, it's at least possible that one day we will

1:35:55.200 --> 1:36:04.760
 look back and realize that we have yet once again formed another tribe and that scripture

1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:12.200
 all along had in it the ability for humans and robots to have a deep, meaningful connection.

1:36:12.200 --> 1:36:17.460
 And that through the robot, the life that enters the body of another robot, what's the

1:36:17.460 --> 1:36:21.120
 difference between a biological body and a mechanical one.

1:36:21.120 --> 1:36:27.040
 And then we will see that the fundamental thing is about the, whatever you want to call

1:36:27.040 --> 1:36:31.960
 it sentience or whatever can permeate an object.

1:36:31.960 --> 1:36:34.620
 That was the thing all along.

1:36:34.620 --> 1:36:36.880
 So I mean.

1:36:36.880 --> 1:36:39.440
 And then you'll get canceled one more time because you will.

1:36:39.440 --> 1:36:40.440
 Because I denied it.

1:36:40.440 --> 1:36:41.440
 I was going to say.

1:36:41.440 --> 1:36:42.440
 No, the opposite.

1:36:42.440 --> 1:36:43.440
 You'll eventually.

1:36:43.440 --> 1:36:44.440
 Oh, I see.

1:36:44.440 --> 1:36:45.440
 Because I'll preach to the robots.

1:36:45.440 --> 1:36:46.440
 I'm hoping.

1:36:46.440 --> 1:36:47.440
 I'm hoping.

1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:48.440
 All right.

1:36:48.440 --> 1:36:55.400
 First of all, depends how quickly you do it and how much longer I have to live.

1:36:55.400 --> 1:37:04.880
 I resist it tremendously, but I am also enough of a student of history to know that my instinctive

1:37:04.880 --> 1:37:11.080
 resistance has nothing to do with whether it will come about.

1:37:11.080 --> 1:37:13.480
 I have a hard time believing it.

1:37:13.480 --> 1:37:15.920
 We'll see.

1:37:15.920 --> 1:37:18.240
 Can I ask you about this?

1:37:18.240 --> 1:37:19.240
 Maybe you can educate me.

1:37:19.240 --> 1:37:24.000
 I tend to believe that you mentioned suffering, that there is a connection between consciousness

1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:25.840
 and suffering.

1:37:25.840 --> 1:37:28.420
 That suffering is a fundamental part.

1:37:28.420 --> 1:37:31.600
 The capacity to suffer is the fundamental part of being human.

1:37:31.600 --> 1:37:34.540
 I mean, I would look at when you're not conscious, you don't suffer.

1:37:34.540 --> 1:37:37.600
 You know, we've had operations where we've been put under anesthetic.

1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:39.960
 We're not conscious and we don't suffer during the operation.

1:37:39.960 --> 1:37:43.600
 If we were conscious, we would.

1:37:43.600 --> 1:37:48.840
 But there's also, I mean, there's a nonphysical suffering that is very much tied to consciousness.

1:37:48.840 --> 1:37:55.840
 I can think of things right now that will cause me suffering, like pain that I've caused

1:37:55.840 --> 1:37:59.760
 or pain that other people I care about have felt or so on.

1:37:59.760 --> 1:38:04.120
 So I don't see how I think that way.

1:38:04.120 --> 1:38:05.920
 I think it's equally true of joy.

1:38:05.920 --> 1:38:09.120
 Joy is also a product of consciousness.

1:38:09.120 --> 1:38:14.760
 All tied in in some beautiful, messy way with memory and so on that we can reexperience

1:38:14.760 --> 1:38:17.840
 it when we recall the memories.

1:38:17.840 --> 1:38:19.480
 But why is there suffering?

1:38:19.480 --> 1:38:20.480
 You mentioned evil.

1:38:20.480 --> 1:38:21.560
 Why is there evil in the world?

1:38:21.560 --> 1:38:24.700
 You can tell stories about this.

1:38:24.700 --> 1:38:25.700
 Why is there suffering?

1:38:25.700 --> 1:38:30.520
 Why is there evil in the world if there's a God that cares for us?

1:38:30.520 --> 1:38:35.960
 Let's assume for a minute that everything was a primitive robot.

1:38:35.960 --> 1:38:41.200
 There would be no suffering, but there would also be no growth.

1:38:41.200 --> 1:38:44.800
 And that implies choices.

1:38:44.800 --> 1:38:51.520
 One of the things that I've said that I know why it hurts people, and I don't mean it quite

1:38:51.520 --> 1:38:59.880
 the way, but I will say it nonetheless, is the Holocaust presents the exact same theological

1:38:59.880 --> 1:39:06.160
 question as somebody who gets shot on the streets of a city in Los Angeles, which is,

1:39:06.160 --> 1:39:10.640
 God, why do you allow some people to do bad things to other people?

1:39:10.640 --> 1:39:14.080
 It's on an unimaginable scale, but it's the same question.

1:39:14.080 --> 1:39:18.520
 And the answer has to be you either allow people to have free will or you don't.

1:39:18.520 --> 1:39:24.120
 You can't say as God, I'm going to let everybody have free will, but not Nazis.

1:39:24.120 --> 1:39:29.600
 Nazis don't get free will because Cambodians, they can kill each other.

1:39:29.600 --> 1:39:33.440
 Fondans kill each other, but the Nazis don't get to do that.

1:39:33.440 --> 1:39:39.160
 So that's one piece of the puzzle.

1:39:39.160 --> 1:39:43.720
 And what makes it unfathomable is when you're actually faced with suffering, these kinds

1:39:43.720 --> 1:39:45.440
 of explanations are obscene.

1:39:45.440 --> 1:39:46.440
 They just are.

1:39:46.440 --> 1:39:51.240
 I mean, when somebody is actually suffering, oh, the rabbi said God gave people free will,

1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:53.260
 that's just awful.

1:39:53.260 --> 1:39:59.500
 But there is a second piece to this also, which is that there is natural suffering,

1:39:59.500 --> 1:40:06.460
 like children born with diseases or earthquakes or volcanoes or whatever.

1:40:06.460 --> 1:40:12.980
 And here my argument is that in some ways, suffering has to be random in the world because

1:40:12.980 --> 1:40:16.400
 when people say, why do bad things happen to good people, well, if only good things

1:40:16.400 --> 1:40:21.120
 happen to good people, everybody would be good, but it would have no moral content.

1:40:21.120 --> 1:40:26.040
 The only way you can be good and it have moral content is say, I know that I can live a really

1:40:26.040 --> 1:40:30.240
 good life and have really terrible things happen to me nonetheless.

1:40:30.240 --> 1:40:34.200
 So it feels to me like it has to be a randomly.

1:40:34.200 --> 1:40:40.440
 Now that means, by the way, that I've been incredibly lucky.

1:40:40.440 --> 1:40:43.080
 I don't have a good life because I was good.

1:40:43.080 --> 1:40:45.880
 I have a good life because I was lucky.

1:40:45.880 --> 1:40:50.680
 And that implies not that I should feel guilty about it, but that I have a tremendous responsibility

1:40:50.680 --> 1:40:54.020
 as a result to other people who aren't so lucky.

1:40:54.020 --> 1:40:58.240
 Tremendous responsibility to study the lessons of history, to tell the stories of those who

1:40:58.240 --> 1:41:05.400
 are less lucky and to draw enough wisdom from them so that we have less cruelty and suffering

1:41:05.400 --> 1:41:09.720
 in the world or have new kinds that get us to improve even more.

1:41:09.720 --> 1:41:10.720
 That's right.

1:41:10.720 --> 1:41:11.720
 Exactly.

1:41:11.720 --> 1:41:12.720
 That we suffer better.

1:41:12.720 --> 1:41:22.000
 For a lot of people, mortality is one of the very unfortunate versions of suffering, which

1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:27.880
 is that the ride ends in this realm, whatever it is.

1:41:27.880 --> 1:41:28.880
 What do you think of mortality?

1:41:28.880 --> 1:41:31.400
 Is it something you think about?

1:41:31.400 --> 1:41:33.240
 Is it something you fear?

1:41:33.240 --> 1:41:37.400
 What do you think happens after we die?

1:41:37.400 --> 1:41:40.560
 I don't fear it.

1:41:40.560 --> 1:41:45.660
 First of all, I would say when I was in high school, I think my father actually encouraged

1:41:45.660 --> 1:41:47.120
 me to read this book.

1:41:47.120 --> 1:41:52.620
 I read Ernest Becker's Denial of Death, which I found and still find to be one of the most

1:41:52.620 --> 1:41:56.340
 profound works I've ever come across.

1:41:56.340 --> 1:42:04.880
 And he convinced me that a lot of what our society is about are ways that we avoid encountering

1:42:04.880 --> 1:42:07.480
 our own mortality.

1:42:07.480 --> 1:42:11.640
 Our physicality – I mean, among the points he makes – and I'm not quoting him at

1:42:11.640 --> 1:42:15.880
 all directly – it's like, why does everything about our physical body make us so uncomfortable?

1:42:15.880 --> 1:42:20.640
 Everything that comes out of you, other than tears, is either mildly or very disgusting.

1:42:20.640 --> 1:42:21.640
 Why?

1:42:21.640 --> 1:42:23.120
 Why does that have to be?

1:42:23.120 --> 1:42:28.600
 Why are sex and eating and all the things that are physical surrounded with so much

1:42:28.600 --> 1:42:29.600
 symbolism?

1:42:29.600 --> 1:42:30.600
 I mean, what are table manners, really?

1:42:30.600 --> 1:42:35.200
 They're like, we're not eating like animals because we're not eating like animals.

1:42:35.200 --> 1:42:38.460
 And sex, obviously, has more symbolism around it than anything.

1:42:38.460 --> 1:42:42.360
 And his answer is, anything that reminds you that you're a physical body because that's

1:42:42.360 --> 1:42:43.360
 what dies.

1:42:43.360 --> 1:42:44.360
 Your body dies.

1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:45.360
 It decays.

1:42:45.360 --> 1:42:46.360
 It dies.

1:42:46.360 --> 1:42:47.360
 It gets eaten by worms.

1:42:47.360 --> 1:42:49.960
 That you don't want to think about, so you deny it.

1:42:49.960 --> 1:42:56.520
 I think that part of religion is a confrontation with your own mortality, but also a certain

1:42:56.520 --> 1:43:01.360
 transcendence of it because the idea is something about you is eternal.

1:43:01.360 --> 1:43:04.500
 What exactly I don't know.

1:43:04.500 --> 1:43:07.040
 And you asked, what do I think happens after we die?

1:43:07.040 --> 1:43:14.960
 So I don't know any better than anyone else does, but I'll say two things about it.

1:43:14.960 --> 1:43:21.660
 One is that every image of what it's like is foolish.

1:43:21.660 --> 1:43:24.960
 Mark Twain has, I think, in Letters from Earth, he says, we're going to lie on green fields

1:43:24.960 --> 1:43:28.700
 and listen to harp music, which you wouldn't want to do for five minutes while you're alive,

1:43:28.700 --> 1:43:32.280
 but you think you'll be happy for the rest of eternity doing it after you die.

1:43:32.280 --> 1:43:33.280
 So I don't know.

1:43:33.280 --> 1:43:34.380
 This world was a surprise.

1:43:34.380 --> 1:43:36.160
 So why shouldn't the next world be a surprise?

1:43:36.160 --> 1:43:37.920
 I have no idea.

1:43:37.920 --> 1:43:45.200
 But I really like this parable that's told by a guy in a book on death and mourning by

1:43:45.200 --> 1:43:49.120
 a rabbi in a book on death and mourning about twins in a womb.

1:43:49.120 --> 1:43:54.880
 He says, one of them believes that there's a life outside and the other one doesn't.

1:43:54.880 --> 1:43:58.860
 He says, the one who doesn't says, look, this is the only world we've ever seen, the only

1:43:58.860 --> 1:43:59.860
 world we've ever known.

1:43:59.860 --> 1:44:01.400
 Why do you think there's something out there?

1:44:01.400 --> 1:44:05.680
 He says, now imagine the one who believes is born.

1:44:05.680 --> 1:44:09.820
 Back in the womb, his brother is mourning a death, but outside, everybody's celebrating

1:44:09.820 --> 1:44:10.820
 a birth.

1:44:10.820 --> 1:44:13.200
 He said, and that's what it's like when you die.

1:44:13.200 --> 1:44:14.360
 And I love that image.

1:44:14.360 --> 1:44:16.480
 Yeah, the grass is always greener.

1:44:16.480 --> 1:44:20.780
 It's the new step, but the eternity thing is an interesting one.

1:44:20.780 --> 1:44:27.040
 It's yet another concept that I feel humans are fully inequipped to comprehend.

1:44:27.040 --> 1:44:30.500
 Is eternity fundamental somehow to all of these discussions?

1:44:30.500 --> 1:44:36.060
 I think it is, well, partly because God is supposed to be eternal and therefore it moves

1:44:36.060 --> 1:44:41.560
 the mind in that direction, even though it is completely unfathomable, you know?

1:44:41.560 --> 1:44:46.760
 Because sometimes I would say eternity, you said on a green field, sometimes a moment,

1:44:46.760 --> 1:44:52.840
 like a truly joyful moment, feels like an eternity, the intensity of it.

1:44:52.840 --> 1:44:58.600
 Maybe eternity is more about stopping time versus extending time indefinitely, and it's

1:44:58.600 --> 1:45:03.320
 something that we just totally can't comprehend, us silly humans.

1:45:03.320 --> 1:45:09.840
 All I would say is the older you get, the more you're struck by the fact that time does

1:45:09.840 --> 1:45:13.400
 not freeze.

1:45:13.400 --> 1:45:17.020
 People will sometimes say to me, you haven't aged a day.

1:45:17.020 --> 1:45:22.520
 And then I'll look at an old picture of myself and I'll say, that was very kind of you, but

1:45:22.520 --> 1:45:23.520
 that's not true.

1:45:23.520 --> 1:45:24.520
 It's not true.

1:45:24.520 --> 1:45:31.160
 So, yeah, I mean, I love the idea of seeing eternity in a grain of sand, was how Blake

1:45:31.160 --> 1:45:32.160
 put it.

1:45:32.160 --> 1:45:33.360
 I love that notion.

1:45:33.360 --> 1:45:40.120
 But when you talk about life after death, I think that in some ways, my fundamental

1:45:40.120 --> 1:45:47.000
 faith is in human beings, that this doesn't all disappear, that there's something about

1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:51.200
 people that transcends this world.

1:45:51.200 --> 1:45:54.920
 You mentioned Ernest Becker in high school and denial of death.

1:45:54.920 --> 1:46:00.720
 Maybe you can mention if you still see truth and wisdom in some of this idea.

1:46:00.720 --> 1:46:06.400
 But in general, can you go all the way back and tell some of the fascinating story of

1:46:06.400 --> 1:46:08.880
 how you found faith?

1:46:08.880 --> 1:46:14.680
 When I was in high school, I was a really pretty ardent atheist.

1:46:14.680 --> 1:46:21.200
 And I loved Bertrand Russell, who was, for my money, with all due respect to all the

1:46:21.200 --> 1:46:26.320
 very, very capable people that we've talked about earlier, he's the best atheist pound

1:46:26.320 --> 1:46:32.240
 for pound that there was, and a remarkably witty and lucid writer.

1:46:32.240 --> 1:46:34.040
 And I was totally in his thrall.

1:46:34.040 --> 1:46:37.960
 And I would read every book by Russell I could get my hands on.

1:46:37.960 --> 1:46:47.120
 And the reason that I did, I have this theory that why do adolescent boys like Mr. Spock

1:46:47.120 --> 1:46:51.080
 and like Sherlock Holmes?

1:46:51.080 --> 1:46:55.920
 I think it's because when you hit puberty, for a lot of us, there's so much discomfort

1:46:55.920 --> 1:46:59.240
 with our bodies that we like the idea that we're just brains.

1:46:59.240 --> 1:47:00.840
 I really think so.

1:47:00.840 --> 1:47:02.240
 I had that experience.

1:47:02.240 --> 1:47:05.240
 It's like, I want to just be a thinking machine.

1:47:05.240 --> 1:47:08.080
 I don't want to be a body because my body was making me so uncomfortable.

1:47:08.080 --> 1:47:12.400
 I had all these urges and inclinations that I couldn't control.

1:47:12.400 --> 1:47:14.600
 So Russell was perfect.

1:47:14.600 --> 1:47:20.800
 And my father, who was a rabbi, did the very wise thing of buying me some of Bertrand Russell's

1:47:20.800 --> 1:47:25.340
 books, which was his way of saying, I'm not afraid of him.

1:47:25.340 --> 1:47:27.400
 And actually, there was another rabbi.

1:47:27.400 --> 1:47:32.760
 I was at summer camp, and I was sitting on the porch of the, I remember exactly, and

1:47:32.760 --> 1:47:36.080
 I was reading Bertrand Russell, and this guy came up to me and said, what are you reading?

1:47:36.080 --> 1:47:40.780
 I was maybe 16 or 17, and I said, Bertrand Russell, I was spoiling for a fight.

1:47:40.780 --> 1:47:42.240
 And he said, I'm glad you're reading him.

1:47:42.240 --> 1:47:43.240
 I said, really?

1:47:43.240 --> 1:47:44.240
 Why?

1:47:44.240 --> 1:47:45.240
 He goes, how old are you, David?

1:47:45.240 --> 1:47:47.640
 And I said, whatever I was, 16, 17.

1:47:47.640 --> 1:47:53.160
 He said, well, I'd rather you grow out of him than grow into him.

1:47:53.160 --> 1:47:54.160
 And you know what?

1:47:54.160 --> 1:48:01.200
 He was actually right because when I started to read about Russell's life, I realized

1:48:01.200 --> 1:48:04.680
 that all of that rationality didn't shield him.

1:48:04.680 --> 1:48:11.280
 He had an incredibly messy life, multiple marriages, endless infidelities, family members

1:48:11.280 --> 1:48:14.440
 he didn't speak to who didn't speak to him, by the way, was raised by his grandparents

1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:21.320
 because his parents had died, and really not a happy or, I mean, a remarkable life, but

1:48:21.320 --> 1:48:23.400
 not a happy one.

1:48:23.400 --> 1:48:29.120
 And so I started to believe that maybe it was possible that people who had faith were

1:48:29.120 --> 1:48:38.360
 not just stupid and needed crutches, but saw something deeper than Russell did.

1:48:38.360 --> 1:48:44.360
 And the more people that I met that were like that, it's funny because I always thought,

1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:49.280
 okay, my father is a rabbi, that's great, but nobody else.

1:48:49.280 --> 1:48:54.400
 And I think what happened to me was it was not a logical decision to come to faith.

1:48:54.400 --> 1:48:56.080
 It was a sort of opening of my heart.

1:48:56.080 --> 1:49:02.840
 It's like this world is way much more than my mind can capture, and I've kind of felt

1:49:02.840 --> 1:49:04.440
 my way to God.

1:49:04.440 --> 1:49:10.560
 And in the moments, my faith, you know, there was a rabbi named Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav,

1:49:10.560 --> 1:49:13.800
 he said he was a moon man, his faith waxed and waned.

1:49:13.800 --> 1:49:16.680
 So sometimes I have more, sometimes less.

1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:20.920
 But in my feelinger moments is when I have more.

1:49:20.920 --> 1:49:29.600
 So with your heart open, what would you say in your feelinger moments is the most beautiful

1:49:29.600 --> 1:49:34.000
 part about Judaism and your faith?

1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:41.560
 I think the most beautiful part about Judaism is that even though it is filled with humor

1:49:41.560 --> 1:49:47.200
 and wit, it takes life and it takes the soul seriously.

1:49:47.200 --> 1:49:53.220
 Everybody really believes that this matters, and that we matter, and what we do matters.

1:49:53.220 --> 1:49:58.800
 And I think that that's incredibly important, and especially in a world in which young people

1:49:58.800 --> 1:50:05.220
 feel so much like they don't matter, that's an unbelievably powerful message.

1:50:05.220 --> 1:50:16.520
 I mean, you know, I want to say like almost to every young woman under 30 on TikTok, you

1:50:16.520 --> 1:50:18.560
 don't matter because you're beautiful.

1:50:18.560 --> 1:50:19.880
 That's not why you matter.

1:50:19.880 --> 1:50:21.440
 I hope you know that.

1:50:21.440 --> 1:50:23.900
 You matter because you have a soul.

1:50:23.900 --> 1:50:28.120
 And to every young man who's like nihilistic and doesn't think and just thinks that if

1:50:28.120 --> 1:50:31.340
 they make enough money, their life will be fine, I want to say the same thing, which

1:50:31.340 --> 1:50:38.100
 is really that's not ultimately you matter because you're in the image of God.

1:50:38.100 --> 1:50:42.040
 And Judaism really deeply, deeply believes and preaches that.

1:50:42.040 --> 1:50:48.380
 And I think that that's a message that has so much to say to the world.

1:50:48.380 --> 1:50:51.820
 It's like you have to take people's souls seriously.

1:50:51.820 --> 1:50:56.680
 And for all of the difficulty in figuring out all these social questions and what they

1:50:56.680 --> 1:51:02.400
 mean, I just don't want to dismiss people because I disagree with them politically or

1:51:02.400 --> 1:51:07.080
 socially or culturally, because I think they matter.

1:51:07.080 --> 1:51:16.720
 So ultimately Judaism has a wealth of meaning for a human mind.

1:51:16.720 --> 1:51:18.400
 I really believe that it does.

1:51:18.400 --> 1:51:21.080
 I really do.

1:51:21.080 --> 1:51:27.400
 And its meaning, and I want to emphasize this, is not political.

1:51:27.400 --> 1:51:31.200
 The deepest meaning of Judaism is not political.

1:51:31.200 --> 1:51:33.920
 Well there is, we put politics on top of everything.

1:51:33.920 --> 1:51:34.920
 Exactly.

1:51:34.920 --> 1:51:36.200
 But that's why I want to emphasize it.

1:51:36.200 --> 1:51:38.400
 The deepest meaning is on a soul level.

1:51:38.400 --> 1:51:40.560
 It's not on a voting level.

1:51:40.560 --> 1:51:44.400
 Well that combined with the humor, it's clear to me that Christopher Hitchens should have

1:51:44.400 --> 1:51:45.400
 been a Jew.

1:51:45.400 --> 1:51:46.400
 He was.

1:51:46.400 --> 1:51:47.400
 He actually was.

1:51:47.400 --> 1:51:51.000
 He discovered that in his 30s, that his mother was Jewish.

1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:52.000
 That's fascinating.

1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:53.000
 Yep.

1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:55.480
 He actually, he has a beautiful essay about it, discovering in his 30s that his mother

1:51:55.480 --> 1:51:59.040
 was Jewish, yep.

1:51:59.040 --> 1:52:03.080
 So remarkably enough, he actually was Jewish.

1:52:03.080 --> 1:52:06.380
 His autobiography, Hitch 22, is a great read.

1:52:06.380 --> 1:52:10.440
 And I just want to say, what you discover there, I don't know if I'm giving too much

1:52:10.440 --> 1:52:12.040
 away by telling the story of his life.

1:52:12.040 --> 1:52:13.040
 Spoiler alert.

1:52:13.040 --> 1:52:17.320
 What you discover there is that his mother ran away with a minister or a priest and they

1:52:17.320 --> 1:52:20.280
 died in what seemed like was a suicide pact.

1:52:20.280 --> 1:52:25.360
 And so I read it, unfortunately, after he passed away, but I would have wanted to ask

1:52:25.360 --> 1:52:30.440
 him, do you think that has anything to do maybe with the hostility towards religion?

1:52:30.440 --> 1:52:31.740
 We are only human.

1:52:31.740 --> 1:52:35.560
 My father, I mean, both my parents, but my father, who was a rabbi, was such a wonderful,

1:52:35.560 --> 1:52:36.960
 warm, and loving man.

1:52:36.960 --> 1:52:42.320
 So I associate a religious figure with real goodness.

1:52:42.320 --> 1:52:49.020
 And I'm sorry to return to a darker topic, but I really wanted to ask you this.

1:52:49.020 --> 1:52:54.640
 For the current events, for a recent event, I mentioned Dallas.

1:52:54.640 --> 1:52:59.120
 What lessons do you draw from the Dallas Synagogue hostage incident?

1:52:59.120 --> 1:53:03.600
 Well, the week after that, we had active shooter training in my synagogues.

1:53:03.600 --> 1:53:09.080
 And one of the things I drew was that security for synagogues is important.

1:53:09.080 --> 1:53:17.640
 And the second is that the reality of antisemitism, which I had thought had waned when I first

1:53:17.640 --> 1:53:23.040
 began my rabbinate, I thought it's not going to be such a big issue, it is like an evergreen

1:53:23.040 --> 1:53:24.040
 issue.

1:53:24.040 --> 1:53:30.080
 And Jews and all people of goodwill have to take this really seriously, because it has

1:53:30.080 --> 1:53:31.680
 devastating consequences.

1:53:31.680 --> 1:53:35.340
 And if the world doesn't know that, then it just hasn't been paying attention.

1:53:35.340 --> 1:53:41.800
 So there's antisemitism at a scale of human to human, but there's also, like you mentioned,

1:53:41.800 --> 1:53:48.760
 politics get mixed up into things, nations get mixed into things, impossible to answer.

1:53:48.760 --> 1:53:56.920
 But I have to ask, what do you think about the long running saga of Israel and Palestine?

1:53:56.920 --> 1:54:00.200
 Will we ever see peace in that part of the Middle East?

1:54:00.200 --> 1:54:07.360
 Well, since I'm an optimist about human, look, I mean, I have many, many thoughts about it.

1:54:07.360 --> 1:54:11.780
 I'm a very, very strong supporter of Israel.

1:54:11.780 --> 1:54:16.340
 And I also feel really for the plight of the Palestinians.

1:54:16.340 --> 1:54:26.480
 I think that this is a clash of legitimate narratives that is impossible to exactly split

1:54:26.480 --> 1:54:29.080
 the difference of.

1:54:29.080 --> 1:54:36.560
 However, I know that Israel has made peace with Egypt, has made peace with Jordan, has

1:54:36.560 --> 1:54:39.880
 made peace now with other Arab nations.

1:54:39.880 --> 1:54:44.160
 I don't believe that Israel is unwilling to make peace.

1:54:44.160 --> 1:54:51.220
 And so I think that as difficult as it will be for the Palestinians to come to grips with

1:54:51.220 --> 1:54:56.080
 the fact that the Jewish state is not leaving and is legitimately here, as opposed to we

1:54:56.080 --> 1:55:00.260
 can't get rid of it now, but we will get rid of it one day.

1:55:00.260 --> 1:55:06.820
 If that comes to be, and I believe that it will, I think not only that there would be

1:55:06.820 --> 1:55:10.600
 peace, but I think that those two peoples together could probably do remarkable things

1:55:10.600 --> 1:55:12.140
 in the world.

1:55:12.140 --> 1:55:16.120
 Do you think the source of it is politics?

1:55:16.120 --> 1:55:19.440
 Is it religious ideas?

1:55:19.440 --> 1:55:23.560
 And to flip it, what is the way out?

1:55:23.560 --> 1:55:26.240
 Is it geopolitics?

1:55:26.240 --> 1:55:37.600
 Is it interfaith discourse and collaboration, or is it simply the human love?

1:55:37.600 --> 1:55:43.960
 So I'm not sure that I could give one answer to that, but I will give a piece of an answer.

1:55:43.960 --> 1:55:46.680
 Why did the Abraham Accords happen?

1:55:46.680 --> 1:55:52.840
 The main reason that they happened was because economics overrode ideology.

1:55:52.840 --> 1:55:57.840
 And I actually am hopeful that that's in the end what will happen, that people will

1:55:57.840 --> 1:55:58.840
 say, you know what?

1:55:58.840 --> 1:56:08.200
 If we have such a better life, if we put aside the ideological animosities and just created

1:56:08.200 --> 1:56:11.460
 this different kind of Middle East together.

1:56:11.460 --> 1:56:18.120
 I went to Dubai to watch the World Chess Championship, because I really wanted to see Magnus Carlsen

1:56:18.120 --> 1:56:19.120
 play.

1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:22.480
 I thought, you're alive when you have such a remarkable world champion.

1:56:22.480 --> 1:56:23.480
 Go see him play.

1:56:23.480 --> 1:56:28.820
 So I actually took myself to Dubai for the last couple of games, and I watched.

1:56:28.820 --> 1:56:34.440
 It's not that I'm uninterested in Dubai, but I went there for the chess thing.

1:56:34.440 --> 1:56:37.960
 The Expo was also on at the same time, and I saw, here's this amazing place.

1:56:37.960 --> 1:56:39.160
 I came back.

1:56:39.160 --> 1:56:42.080
 This guy I know who lived in Dubai for several years and works in the Middle East said to

1:56:42.080 --> 1:56:43.180
 me, what did you think of it?

1:56:43.180 --> 1:56:45.880
 And I said, it was nice, it was Dubai.

1:56:45.880 --> 1:56:51.680
 It was very polished, very sophisticated, very clean, no crime and so on.

1:56:51.680 --> 1:56:56.080
 But it was kind of like Las Vegas in the Middle East without the gambling or something like

1:56:56.080 --> 1:56:57.080
 that.

1:56:57.080 --> 1:57:00.920
 And he totally changed my perspective in a couple sentences.

1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:04.100
 He said, I know it seems like that when you come from Los Angeles.

1:57:04.100 --> 1:57:10.240
 He said, but fly there from Yemen or from Riyadh, and it is a miracle.

1:57:10.240 --> 1:57:12.600
 And I thought, oh my God, you're right.

1:57:12.600 --> 1:57:19.120
 It's like what human beings can do if they just put aside their ideological shackles

1:57:19.120 --> 1:57:23.680
 is remarkable, and I'm hopeful that one day that'll happen.

1:57:23.680 --> 1:57:26.240
 Economics allows for higher quality of life.

1:57:26.240 --> 1:57:30.560
 You no longer, it's the playground analogy you said earlier.

1:57:30.560 --> 1:57:38.280
 If there's more resources to play with, unfortunately, us humans are more willing to play with others.

1:57:38.280 --> 1:57:39.600
 And maybe that is the solution.

1:57:39.600 --> 1:57:47.320
 And maybe, I mean, for me, from a technology perspective, innovation, engineering helps

1:57:47.320 --> 1:57:49.760
 make everybody's life better.

1:57:49.760 --> 1:57:56.840
 And over that, once people's lives become better, they start to have more time to be

1:57:56.840 --> 1:57:58.360
 empathetic and hear people out.

1:57:58.360 --> 1:58:00.520
 And they have more to lose.

1:58:00.520 --> 1:58:05.920
 When you have more to lose, it actually makes you, I think, countries are less willing to

1:58:05.920 --> 1:58:08.840
 go to war when they have more to lose.

1:58:08.840 --> 1:58:12.180
 And families want peace when it's good at home.

1:58:12.180 --> 1:58:14.920
 So I think there's an element of that as well.

1:58:14.920 --> 1:58:19.600
 And some of it, again, taking us back to the other aspect of our conversation is how we're

1:58:19.600 --> 1:58:23.120
 conducting ourselves in conversation online and so on.

1:58:23.120 --> 1:58:30.240
 Because I think, actually, I'm a big fan of the idea of social media that is a way for

1:58:30.240 --> 1:58:32.440
 us to connect together.

1:58:32.440 --> 1:58:36.800
 I think there's a lot of really strong ideas how to do that well.

1:58:36.800 --> 1:58:44.240
 And clearly, the initial attempts that kind of just open it up wide, some of the lesser

1:58:44.240 --> 1:58:50.120
 aspects of human nature can take over when combined with different forces like advertisements

1:58:50.120 --> 1:58:52.360
 and virology and all those kinds of things.

1:58:52.360 --> 1:58:58.560
 But overall, I love the honesty of the mess of it being presented before us on social

1:58:58.560 --> 1:59:00.100
 media.

1:59:00.100 --> 1:59:06.320
 Part of me, maybe because I don't participate it, like if somebody is being mean to me or

1:59:06.320 --> 1:59:13.400
 being aggressive and these kinds of things, I enjoy it because it's human nature.

1:59:13.400 --> 1:59:15.040
 But I enjoy it because I don't respond.

1:59:15.040 --> 1:59:19.560
 I think if I responded, I would get pulled into this human nature and then it's not fun.

1:59:19.560 --> 1:59:22.600
 But I love the, like I'll talk to people.

1:59:22.600 --> 1:59:24.720
 In fact, I still visit Clubhouse.

1:59:24.720 --> 1:59:25.720
 I don't know if you know what that is.

1:59:25.720 --> 1:59:26.720
 Sure.

1:59:26.720 --> 1:59:27.720
 Oh, right.

1:59:27.720 --> 1:59:28.720
 That's right.

1:59:28.720 --> 1:59:29.720
 Actually, when I...

1:59:29.720 --> 1:59:30.720
 I think that's how we first met.

1:59:30.720 --> 1:59:31.720
 Well, yeah.

1:59:31.720 --> 1:59:32.720
 Well, I was such a fan boy.

1:59:32.720 --> 1:59:37.200
 Actually, when I first heard you, I was like, I can't believe I get to talk to David.

1:59:37.200 --> 1:59:47.600
 But the Israel Palestine topic was something that was very deeply in a heated way discussed

1:59:47.600 --> 1:59:48.600
 on Clubhouse.

1:59:48.600 --> 1:59:52.360
 Race relations is the thing that was really heatedly discussed.

1:59:52.360 --> 1:59:55.440
 And I now go to Clubhouse to practice Russian.

1:59:55.440 --> 2:00:03.420
 And there in Russian, the heated discussion is on basically any topic as meaningless or

2:00:03.420 --> 2:00:06.760
 meaningful as you want in the heat of it.

2:00:06.760 --> 2:00:12.360
 Just people just screaming and then calming down and going through the full process.

2:00:12.360 --> 2:00:15.080
 That too is beautiful because that emotion is there.

2:00:15.080 --> 2:00:21.700
 And if it is allowed to have a voice, I think ultimately it leads to healing.

2:00:21.700 --> 2:00:26.720
 So that felt really healthy if you learn how to do that at scale.

2:00:26.720 --> 2:00:32.040
 Social media, I wish that it were not as algorithmically biased towards conflict.

2:00:32.040 --> 2:00:33.560
 I don't think that that's healthy.

2:00:33.560 --> 2:00:41.500
 But I think it brings a lot of blessings into people's lives if they use it wisely.

2:00:41.500 --> 2:00:45.880
 Like anything else, it can be awful.

2:00:45.880 --> 2:00:51.040
 But I've connected to all sorts of people that I never would have known.

2:00:51.040 --> 2:00:52.360
 And that's been wonderful.

2:00:52.360 --> 2:00:57.440
 So let me ask you the big question of advice.

2:00:57.440 --> 2:01:04.240
 What advice would you give to young people today that are maybe high school, college,

2:01:04.240 --> 2:01:08.080
 thinking about career, thinking about life, they can be proud of.

2:01:08.080 --> 2:01:13.200
 So the first thing that I would say is that life is longer than you think it is.

2:01:13.200 --> 2:01:22.100
 Even though I understand the impulse to be in a rush, you will have many unfoldings.

2:01:22.100 --> 2:01:24.440
 More even than people of my generation did.

2:01:24.440 --> 2:01:26.280
 Unfoldings, that's such a funny word.

2:01:26.280 --> 2:01:28.960
 But it feels that way.

2:01:28.960 --> 2:01:35.320
 It's like different aspects of your life will come, will show you different possibilities

2:01:35.320 --> 2:01:40.640
 that you don't imagine at the moment.

2:01:40.640 --> 2:01:49.680
 And I think the second thing that I would say is, I know that this is a very old fashioned,

2:01:49.680 --> 2:01:57.160
 but I would say to the extent that you can read, don't just, and not just on social media,

2:01:57.160 --> 2:01:58.920
 read books.

2:01:58.920 --> 2:02:05.480
 Learn things that will give you a broader context for your life than just today or yesterday

2:02:05.480 --> 2:02:09.720
 or the day before.

2:02:09.720 --> 2:02:22.560
 And I suppose the other thing that I would say is that to the extent that you can try

2:02:22.560 --> 2:02:29.840
 to develop your own internal metric of both what matters and what is good, because you

2:02:29.840 --> 2:02:36.440
 will be exposed to more voices than any generation in history telling you that that's good or

2:02:36.440 --> 2:02:37.440
 this is good.

2:02:37.440 --> 2:02:41.760
 They're called influences, influencers, but what they are is voices telling you what you

2:02:41.760 --> 2:02:44.040
 should think and what you should believe.

2:02:44.040 --> 2:02:51.620
 And so have some internal space where you'll be able to say, for example, I know this person

2:02:51.620 --> 2:02:54.800
 is doing that and it looks great, but that's not me.

2:02:54.800 --> 2:03:02.320
 You have a community of people that speak to you with a lot of passion.

2:03:02.320 --> 2:03:09.120
 Do you still have that voice in your own, in the privacy of your own mind that you're

2:03:09.120 --> 2:03:15.880
 able to ignore, like for a moment, just be with yourself, think what is right?

2:03:15.880 --> 2:03:16.880
 Absolutely.

2:03:16.880 --> 2:03:19.240
 And I think it's partly because I grew up without that.

2:03:19.240 --> 2:03:24.480
 I mean, I grew up with a lot of space in my life, and so I had a chance to develop that

2:03:24.480 --> 2:03:25.480
 voice.

2:03:25.480 --> 2:03:28.400
 That's why I think it's harder for kids today than it was for me.

2:03:28.400 --> 2:03:31.640
 I mean, I grew up when there were three channels, there was three, six and 10.

2:03:31.640 --> 2:03:35.120
 There was ABC, CBS and NBC, and that was it.

2:03:35.120 --> 2:03:38.800
 And you spent your evening playing board games or reading or whatever, and there was a lot

2:03:38.800 --> 2:03:40.200
 of space.

2:03:40.200 --> 2:03:44.120
 And we played football on the street and you went on your bike in the morning and nobody

2:03:44.120 --> 2:03:49.160
 worried about you and you came home at night and everybody assumed you were fine.

2:03:49.160 --> 2:03:56.320
 And so I really feel, and also I went into a religious tradition where I feel like I

2:03:56.320 --> 2:04:01.120
 have the opportunity to judge myself by bigger metrics.

2:04:01.120 --> 2:04:02.120
 And it's still hard.

2:04:02.120 --> 2:04:06.860
 I don't want to, it's not like, oh, I wear impenetrable armor.

2:04:06.860 --> 2:04:07.860
 It's still hard.

2:04:07.860 --> 2:04:13.880
 So how much harder for kids today when they don't have that?

2:04:13.880 --> 2:04:15.600
 You mentioned books.

2:04:15.600 --> 2:04:21.880
 Is there Bertrand Russell and Denial of Death by Ernest Becker, is there books that pop

2:04:21.880 --> 2:04:25.200
 into mind that had an impact on you?

2:04:25.200 --> 2:04:27.800
 My favorite novel is Middlemarch.

2:04:27.800 --> 2:04:28.800
 Middlemarch?

2:04:28.800 --> 2:04:29.800
 Middlemarch.

2:04:29.800 --> 2:04:34.600
 I was listening to a podcast, I was listening to one of your podcasts where your guest said

2:04:34.600 --> 2:04:42.120
 the two greatest novels of the 19th century were Brothers Karamazov and, what was the

2:04:42.120 --> 2:04:43.120
 other one he mentioned?

2:04:43.120 --> 2:04:44.120
 I don't remember.

2:04:44.120 --> 2:04:45.120
 Dostoevsky as well or no?

2:04:45.120 --> 2:04:46.120
 I think.

2:04:46.120 --> 2:04:47.120
 Was it both Dostoevsky?

2:04:47.120 --> 2:04:48.120
 It might have been.

2:04:48.120 --> 2:04:49.120
 I don't remember.

2:04:49.120 --> 2:04:51.880
 But anyway, but I would say Middlemarch is up there.

2:04:51.880 --> 2:04:57.840
 Middlemarch presents an entire world and it's written by a woman, Marianne Evans, who took

2:04:57.840 --> 2:05:04.920
 the pen name George Eliot, who you feel, Virginia Woolf said it's the only English novel written

2:05:04.920 --> 2:05:07.320
 for grownups.

2:05:07.320 --> 2:05:12.640
 You feel the genius in her sentences, like the pressure of her intellect in her sentences.

2:05:12.640 --> 2:05:14.240
 It's a wonderful, wonderful book.

2:05:14.240 --> 2:05:15.540
 I love it.

2:05:15.540 --> 2:05:16.800
 Pressure of her intellect.

2:05:16.800 --> 2:05:20.000
 Yeah, you really do.

2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:26.840
 I also love Saul Bellow, especially Herzog, but it's a very different kind of thinking

2:05:26.840 --> 2:05:27.840
 person's novel.

2:05:27.840 --> 2:05:32.320
 I read a lot of mysteries and a lot of other kinds of fiction and literature.

2:05:32.320 --> 2:05:40.880
 But in terms of the books that most, you mentioned one of them, which is Viktor Frankl's Man's

2:05:40.880 --> 2:05:43.240
 Search for Meaning.

2:05:43.240 --> 2:05:45.960
 And I also really, really love Heschel's The Sabbath.

2:05:45.960 --> 2:05:48.440
 I think it's a beautiful book.

2:05:48.440 --> 2:05:51.680
 It's a very short book, just as Frankl's book is.

2:05:51.680 --> 2:05:54.840
 What do you take from The Man's Search for Meaning?

2:05:54.840 --> 2:06:05.120
 What do you take of a human being in the worst conditions, being able to non dramatically

2:06:05.120 --> 2:06:10.360
 find little joys, find beauty?

2:06:10.360 --> 2:06:15.240
 It's what I said before about Judaism's advice to younger people, is that it mattered.

2:06:15.240 --> 2:06:20.300
 If you believe that something matters, you have enormous resilience.

2:06:20.300 --> 2:06:24.380
 It's meaninglessness that is the greatest threat to a decent life.

2:06:24.380 --> 2:06:30.180
 When people are deeply depressed, whether it is chemical depression or what they feel

2:06:30.180 --> 2:06:34.380
 like is this is all meaningless.

2:06:34.380 --> 2:06:43.320
 And meaning, now obviously chemical depression calls in part for chemical means, but meaning

2:06:43.320 --> 2:06:47.660
 is the great antidote.

2:06:47.660 --> 2:06:49.680
 We can talk about what kind of meaning.

2:06:49.680 --> 2:06:55.440
 There are kinds of meanings that are awful, but meaning is the great antidote to a sense

2:06:55.440 --> 2:07:03.800
 that life is just nihilistic and purposeless and to that destructiveness that I think is

2:07:03.800 --> 2:07:04.800
 too common.

2:07:04.800 --> 2:07:14.000
 Yeah, so maybe the heroic action in Nazi Germany, in the Holocaust, in the camps is the, even

2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:18.200
 not the action, but just the realization that every life matters.

2:07:18.200 --> 2:07:25.240
 So here's this really wonderful story that Hugo Grin, who was a rabbi in England, died,

2:07:25.240 --> 2:07:29.440
 I don't know, like 15, 20 years ago, he used to tell, he grew up in Auschwitz.

2:07:29.440 --> 2:07:34.280
 He was a child there and he was with his father and it was Hanukkah and you're supposed to

2:07:34.280 --> 2:07:35.400
 light the candles.

2:07:35.400 --> 2:07:39.800
 And his father took the margarine ration and used it as the oil to light the Hanukkah candles.

2:07:39.800 --> 2:07:43.500
 And Hugo was scandalized and he said, that's our food.

2:07:43.500 --> 2:07:49.080
 And his father said, what we have learned, my son, is you can live for three weeks without

2:07:49.080 --> 2:07:50.080
 food.

2:07:50.080 --> 2:07:54.120
 You can live for three days without water, but you can't live for three minutes without

2:07:54.120 --> 2:07:56.120
 hope.

2:07:56.120 --> 2:08:04.040
 Well, hope, let me ask you, you said meaning.

2:08:04.040 --> 2:08:06.040
 What's the meaning of this whole thing?

2:08:06.040 --> 2:08:07.600
 What's the meaning of life?

2:08:07.600 --> 2:08:11.560
 You're the perfect person to ask this question, Rabbi David Wolff.

2:08:11.560 --> 2:08:16.160
 I believe the meaning of life is for human beings to grow in soul.

2:08:16.160 --> 2:08:17.160
 That's why we're here.

2:08:17.160 --> 2:08:19.120
 And you can do that in infinite numbers of ways.

2:08:19.120 --> 2:08:24.520
 But if you're supposed to return your soul like more burnished and beautiful, then you

2:08:24.520 --> 2:08:25.520
 got it.

2:08:25.520 --> 2:08:32.240
 I mean, it's going to have some nicks and cuts, but that's what it means to deepen and

2:08:32.240 --> 2:08:33.240
 grow it.

2:08:33.240 --> 2:08:38.280
 And you do that more than anything else.

2:08:38.280 --> 2:08:40.120
 You do that by learning how to love.

2:08:40.120 --> 2:08:43.120
 I mean, that's the principle way, I think, that you do it.

2:08:43.120 --> 2:08:50.040
 You know, it's interesting because for a human, the relationship, if you're a man of faith,

2:08:50.040 --> 2:08:51.040
 is with God.

2:08:51.040 --> 2:08:59.840
 But it feels like love is so richly part of human society that it's not just love of God,

2:08:59.840 --> 2:09:01.440
 it's love of each other.

2:09:01.440 --> 2:09:02.440
 Right.

2:09:02.440 --> 2:09:03.440
 Yep.

2:09:03.440 --> 2:09:04.440
 There's no question about the idea.

2:09:04.440 --> 2:09:10.000
 I mean, in Judaism, that was actually the great innovation of the monotheistic idea.

2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:14.720
 In pagan societies, it was all about how you treated the gods.

2:09:14.720 --> 2:09:17.360
 Monotheism said, no, God cares how you treat each other.

2:09:17.360 --> 2:09:25.920
 So it's, in fact, the mystics use the same kind of word in Hebrew, davekut, which means

2:09:25.920 --> 2:09:30.120
 clinging, that is used about Adam and Eve.

2:09:30.120 --> 2:09:35.280
 It says, therefore, a man will leave his father and mother and davak with his wife.

2:09:35.280 --> 2:09:36.580
 And davak means cling.

2:09:36.580 --> 2:09:39.440
 So there is an analogy there, absolutely.

2:09:39.440 --> 2:09:45.320
 Yeah, I kind of think of human civilization as that movie, March of the Penguins, and

2:09:45.320 --> 2:09:48.160
 they're all huddling together in the cold.

2:09:48.160 --> 2:09:59.120
 This is fundamentally human, this darkness all around us of uncertainty, of cruelty.

2:09:59.120 --> 2:10:04.200
 It seems like everything is so fragile, and we're just kind of all huddling together for

2:10:04.200 --> 2:10:05.200
 warmth.

2:10:05.200 --> 2:10:06.200
 Yes.

2:10:06.200 --> 2:10:09.000
 And that's all we got is each other.

2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:16.680
 So we started with the big question of what is God, ended with what is meaning.

2:10:16.680 --> 2:10:20.560
 Rabbi Wolpe, I've been a huge, as I've told you, huge, huge fan of yours for a long time.

2:10:20.560 --> 2:10:22.960
 It's such an honor that you talked to me today.

2:10:22.960 --> 2:10:23.960
 Thank you so much.

2:10:23.960 --> 2:10:27.640
 I am really so happy to be here, and thank you so much for the conversation.

2:10:27.640 --> 2:10:29.920
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with David Wolpe.

2:10:29.920 --> 2:10:34.040
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:10:34.040 --> 2:10:38.480
 And now, let me leave you with some words from David himself.

2:10:38.480 --> 2:10:43.920
 The only whole heart is a broken one, because it lets the light in.

2:10:43.920 --> 2:11:10.480
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
