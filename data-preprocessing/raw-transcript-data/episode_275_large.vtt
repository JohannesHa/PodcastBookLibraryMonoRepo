00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
 There are no right answers for anything involved in art.

00:03.120 --> 00:06.500
 We're all trying experiments to find a way.

00:06.500 --> 00:08.320
 And even for the things that I work on,

00:08.320 --> 00:11.200
 I don't have a set way that I do anything.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.960
 I come to every project blank.

00:13.960 --> 00:16.220
 Maybe you're just a meat vehicle

00:16.220 --> 00:18.560
 and you're channeling ideas from somewhere else.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.320
 I believe we know close to nothing,

00:22.300 --> 00:25.480
 close to nothing, about anything.

00:25.480 --> 00:27.760
 If we embrace that not knowing,

00:27.760 --> 00:31.820
 we'll have a healthier experience going through life.

00:34.320 --> 00:36.860
 The following is a conversation with Rick Rubin,

00:36.860 --> 00:40.320
 one of the greatest music producers of all time,

00:40.320 --> 00:43.640
 known for bringing the best out of anyone he works with,

00:43.640 --> 00:47.080
 no matter the genre of music or even the medium of art,

00:47.080 --> 00:48.720
 or just the medium of creating

00:48.720 --> 00:50.940
 something beautiful in this world.

00:50.940 --> 00:54.120
 And the list of musicians he produced includes many,

00:54.120 --> 00:57.760
 many, many of the greats over the past 40 years,

00:57.760 --> 01:01.760
 including the Beastie Boys, Eminem, Metallica,

01:01.760 --> 01:04.640
 LL Cool J, Kanye West, Slayer, Tom Petty,

01:04.640 --> 01:08.240
 Johnny Cash, Dixie Chicks, Aerosmith, Adele,

01:08.240 --> 01:10.360
 Danzig, Red Hot Chili Peppers,

01:10.360 --> 01:13.660
 System of a Down, Jay Z, Black Sabbath.

01:13.660 --> 01:16.520
 I can keep going for a very long time here.

01:16.520 --> 01:20.600
 Most importantly, Rick is just an amazing human being.

01:20.600 --> 01:23.840
 We became fast friends, which is surreal to say,

01:23.840 --> 01:26.640
 and is just an incredible honor.

01:26.640 --> 01:28.560
 I felt truly heard as a person

01:28.560 --> 01:30.200
 when I spent the day with him

01:30.200 --> 01:32.400
 eating some delicious Texas barbecue,

01:32.400 --> 01:37.400
 talking about life, about music, about art, about beauty.

01:37.520 --> 01:41.200
 This was a conversation and experience I will never forget.

01:42.240 --> 01:44.320
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:44.320 --> 01:46.520
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:46.520 --> 01:47.760
 in the description.

01:47.760 --> 01:51.240
 And now, dear friends, here's Rick Rubin.

01:51.240 --> 01:53.720
 Are you nervous?

01:53.720 --> 01:57.240
 I'm not shaky, but I would say I feel uneasy.

01:57.240 --> 01:59.600
 And I feel like the sooner we start talking,

01:59.600 --> 02:01.320
 the more relaxed we'll get.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.200
 Yeah.

02:02.200 --> 02:03.920
 Well, maybe we should sit in this moment

02:03.920 --> 02:05.840
 and enjoy the nervousness of it.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.740
 Let me start with Nietzsche.

02:09.920 --> 02:12.920
 He said, without music, life would be a mistake.

02:12.920 --> 02:14.660
 What do you think he means by that?

02:14.660 --> 02:15.960
 Let's talk some philosophy.

02:15.960 --> 02:20.960
 Let's try to analyze Friedrich Nietzsche from a century ago.

02:22.020 --> 02:26.000
 It seems like music has the ability

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
 to bring us so much depth in our soul

02:31.720 --> 02:33.760
 that's hard to access any other way.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.200
 And without it, there would be a loss

02:37.200 --> 02:39.500
 beyond the pleasure of it.

02:41.560 --> 02:45.160
 Feels like it's a window into something else.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.840
 Something that no other medium

02:47.840 --> 02:51.000
 can express quite the same way.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.040
 I would say not as automatically.

02:53.040 --> 02:56.400
 Something about music can do it automatically.

02:56.400 --> 03:01.400
 Maybe poetry or maybe certain abstract forms

03:02.320 --> 03:04.620
 can get us there.

03:04.620 --> 03:06.840
 But there's something about music

03:06.840 --> 03:09.340
 that really can get us there quickly.

03:09.340 --> 03:11.960
 But it's also the time, the place, the history.

03:11.960 --> 03:15.160
 There's something about, like a lot of my family's

03:15.160 --> 03:17.840
 still in Philly, there's something about driving

03:18.800 --> 03:22.860
 through Jersey and listening to Bruce Springsteen.

03:23.720 --> 03:25.840
 And then you just, I'll get emotional.

03:27.160 --> 03:29.960
 Like listening to I'm On Fire.

03:29.960 --> 03:33.840
 That like, one of my favorite Bruce Springsteen songs,

03:33.840 --> 03:38.720
 there's a haunting kind of strumming to it.

03:38.720 --> 03:41.720
 It's not a strumming, it's actually picked.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.120
 It has a country feel to it,

03:43.120 --> 03:45.160
 almost like a Johnny Cash feel actually.

03:45.160 --> 03:47.600
 And it, I don't know, makes me feel,

03:47.600 --> 03:50.040
 so for people who don't know, I'm On Fire.

03:50.040 --> 03:55.040
 That song is, I guess, a love song to a woman

03:56.860 --> 04:01.860
 that you can't have because she's married

04:02.160 --> 04:03.760
 or she's with somebody else,

04:03.760 --> 04:06.320
 which I guess is quite a lot of love songs.

04:06.320 --> 04:08.480
 But there's something about the haunting nature

04:08.480 --> 04:12.920
 of the guitar and then it has to be driving through Jersey.

04:12.920 --> 04:16.000
 And I feel like everyone has fallen in love

04:16.000 --> 04:18.920
 with a Jersey girl at one point in their life.

04:18.920 --> 04:21.040
 I don't know if that's true for her,

04:21.040 --> 04:22.440
 but I feel like that.

04:22.440 --> 04:25.640
 I haven't either, but I just feel like that.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.080
 There's something about Bruce Springsteen is like,

04:27.080 --> 04:28.400
 yeah, I've been there.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.680
 And that just takes you to a place of emotion

04:33.680 --> 04:37.320
 that you just, that captures love,

04:37.320 --> 04:40.880
 that captures longing, that captures the heartbreak

04:40.880 --> 04:42.420
 of just the way time flows in life

04:42.420 --> 04:43.560
 and the fact that it's finite

04:43.560 --> 04:47.520
 and just all of that in a single simple song.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.260
 What else can capture that?

04:49.260 --> 04:50.720
 Yeah, I don't know.

04:50.720 --> 04:53.920
 But it's true that there's a connection

04:53.920 --> 04:55.720
 both between time and place and music.

04:55.720 --> 05:00.720
 And I, certain music growing up on the East Coast

05:02.000 --> 05:03.280
 didn't really resonate with me

05:03.280 --> 05:05.240
 until I spent time on the West Coast.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.680
 Eagles being an example.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.200
 When I lived in New York,

05:08.200 --> 05:09.840
 the Eagles didn't really speak to me.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.400
 ZZ Top didn't really speak to me.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.640
 And then when I started spending time in California

05:14.640 --> 05:16.840
 and driving through Laurel Canyon,

05:16.840 --> 05:19.000
 all of a sudden the music of the Eagles felt

05:20.120 --> 05:21.880
 appropriate somehow.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.840
 And I started listening to it more.

05:23.840 --> 05:24.680
 Got it.

05:24.680 --> 05:26.080
 So not until you went out West

05:26.080 --> 05:29.520
 can you understand the sounds of the West.

05:29.520 --> 05:32.620
 So it's really like New York has a sound.

05:32.620 --> 05:34.920
 What other places have a sound in the United States?

05:34.920 --> 05:36.760
 I think every place does.

05:36.760 --> 05:40.360
 And that said, sometimes we can get an experience

05:40.360 --> 05:42.800
 through music of a place.

05:42.800 --> 05:46.520
 Like we can resonate with the music and not understand why.

05:46.520 --> 05:47.840
 And then maybe when we go to the place

05:47.840 --> 05:49.800
 where it was created,

05:49.800 --> 05:52.020
 it's almost like we have a knowingness of that place.

05:52.020 --> 05:54.000
 It's not a strange place anymore.

05:54.960 --> 05:58.960
 Yeah, Stevie Ray Vaughan with blues and Texas blues.

05:58.960 --> 06:01.640
 You can just listen to Texas Flood and just,

06:01.640 --> 06:03.880
 again, this is like a woman you're missing,

06:03.880 --> 06:07.200
 a broken heart and somehow that connects to the place.

06:07.200 --> 06:11.400
 The Eagles, what song with the Eagles connects with you?

06:11.400 --> 06:15.520
 Are we talking about like Take It Easy

06:15.520 --> 06:18.440
 or are we talking more like Hotel California?

06:18.440 --> 06:21.240
 I'm thinking Take It Easy, but both are great.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.760
 Yeah, there's certain songs

06:23.760 --> 06:27.000
 when I started learning guitar when I was young

06:27.000 --> 06:29.480
 that's like, I would like to be the kind of person

06:29.480 --> 06:31.920
 that not only knows how to play this song,

06:31.920 --> 06:36.720
 but understands the song and like have that song

06:36.720 --> 06:39.160
 be something I played 20 years ago.

06:40.480 --> 06:42.680
 And I've lived with that song for a while.

06:42.680 --> 06:45.480
 Like Hotel California is an example.

06:45.480 --> 06:47.480
 Obviously there's the solo,

06:47.480 --> 06:50.360
 but there's also the soulfulness of the lyrics,

06:50.360 --> 06:51.760
 which I still don't understand.

06:51.760 --> 06:52.920
 And it could be about anything.

06:52.920 --> 06:53.820
 And as you get older,

06:53.820 --> 06:56.080
 I feel like the meaning of the song could be anything.

06:56.080 --> 06:57.720
 Yeah, I think that's true.

06:57.720 --> 06:59.040
 I think that's the beauty of them.

06:59.040 --> 07:00.280
 I think when the person wrote them,

07:00.280 --> 07:03.260
 they may have had one interpretation,

07:04.800 --> 07:08.420
 but it's not contingent on us getting that interpretation

07:08.420 --> 07:12.800
 to like it or resonate with it or feel it.

07:12.800 --> 07:17.680
 In some ways, the best art is open enough

07:18.780 --> 07:21.660
 where the artist gets to have their experience

07:21.660 --> 07:22.500
 when they make it

07:22.500 --> 07:24.480
 and then the audience gets to have their experience

07:24.480 --> 07:26.880
 when they listen and they don't have to be the same.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.360
 And then it connects thousands

07:28.360 --> 07:30.960
 or millions of people together.

07:30.960 --> 07:34.180
 There's a togetherness of music when you share that music,

07:34.180 --> 07:36.840
 when you're listening to stuff together, like in a car.

07:36.840 --> 07:39.720
 First of all, the car is a sacred place.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.160
 So I work in part on autonomous vehicles.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.600
 And you start to think, well,

07:44.600 --> 07:46.780
 what are the things you lose

07:46.780 --> 07:51.160
 when the car stops being the central part of American life?

07:53.080 --> 07:54.880
 The car ownership.

07:54.880 --> 07:57.780
 It just feels like the car, when you're alone,

07:57.780 --> 08:01.080
 it's like a therapist thing, session,

08:01.080 --> 08:04.960
 because you get angry at other humans

08:04.960 --> 08:09.520
 and then you get to like sit in your own anger and emotion.

08:09.520 --> 08:12.240
 You get to listen to the song on a long road trip

08:12.240 --> 08:17.240
 and remember, like run through your memories, the heartbreak.

08:18.840 --> 08:20.280
 I don't know, the one that got away,

08:20.280 --> 08:23.440
 but also like the beautiful moments, all of it.

08:23.440 --> 08:27.960
 Yeah, and all of that in the car.

08:27.960 --> 08:30.780
 Yeah, driving also serves another purpose.

08:30.780 --> 08:34.200
 And it's one of the things that we can do

08:34.200 --> 08:39.200
 that we have to pay attention enough not to crash,

08:41.160 --> 08:45.640
 but typically can essentially run on autopilot enough

08:45.640 --> 08:47.560
 where we could be thinking about something else

08:47.560 --> 08:50.560
 or concentrating on something else.

08:50.560 --> 08:53.440
 And the difference between concentrating on something

08:53.440 --> 08:55.520
 or trying to solve a problem

08:55.520 --> 08:57.560
 when you're solely trying to solve a problem

08:57.560 --> 08:59.600
 versus when you have some little task

08:59.600 --> 09:01.920
 that's keeping you occupied,

09:01.920 --> 09:06.920
 I find if I have something slight to take care of,

09:09.020 --> 09:12.960
 it frees a more creative side of my mind

09:12.960 --> 09:15.520
 to better solve problems.

09:15.520 --> 09:17.220
 You know, I'm kind of jealous of people

09:17.220 --> 09:19.700
 that found that in painting, for example.

09:19.700 --> 09:22.680
 They'll be drawing or painting and listening to,

09:22.680 --> 09:25.080
 so that's the small task you do.

09:25.080 --> 09:27.400
 You're coloring in the lines.

09:27.400 --> 09:31.600
 It's like this gentle, peaceful, slow process

09:31.600 --> 09:33.780
 that requires just a small fraction of your mind

09:33.780 --> 09:34.780
 and then you can listen.

09:34.780 --> 09:36.980
 Some people listen to podcasts that way.

09:36.980 --> 09:39.120
 Some people listen to music that way.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.000
 Yeah.

09:40.000 --> 09:40.960
 How do you do it?

09:40.960 --> 09:42.940
 How do you free your mind?

09:42.940 --> 09:47.940
 Yeah, running is one of them.

09:51.940 --> 09:54.020
 There's a process.

09:54.020 --> 09:57.100
 So most freeing of the mind for me

09:57.100 --> 10:01.380
 has to go through a process of a bit of pain for a bit.

10:01.380 --> 10:02.980
 So doing something difficult,

10:04.020 --> 10:06.940
 so it's like an airplane taking off or something.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.060
 So that's like, for example, running.

10:09.060 --> 10:10.820
 The first few miles would just be,

10:10.820 --> 10:14.700
 just first of all, the physical aspect,

10:14.700 --> 10:16.340
 which is like, ah, you're so fat.

10:16.340 --> 10:17.180
 You're out of shape.

10:17.180 --> 10:20.060
 You're, this is the getting old, this, that.

10:20.060 --> 10:21.860
 Okay, that slowly dissipates.

10:21.860 --> 10:25.600
 And then the demons come in who are like,

10:25.600 --> 10:30.020
 you should be getting this and that and this done.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.400
 You haven't gotten it done.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.580
 You're like breaking promises,

10:33.580 --> 10:35.980
 all those kinds of voices coming in.

10:35.980 --> 10:39.180
 And after that, maybe mile four,

10:39.180 --> 10:40.980
 it's like, fuck it.

10:40.980 --> 10:44.980
 You just run, run with the wind at a very slow pace,

10:44.980 --> 10:47.920
 but with the wind, and then you could think.

10:47.920 --> 10:50.900
 So it's the footsteps, the physical activity.

10:50.900 --> 10:54.620
 Then you could deeply think about stuff, ideas,

10:54.620 --> 10:56.980
 sort of design, whether it's program design stuff

10:56.980 --> 11:00.260
 or like high level life decisions, all those kinds of things.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.460
 I would say running.

11:02.460 --> 11:05.580
 I used to build bridges from toothpicks.

11:05.580 --> 11:07.780
 I used to be a thing.

11:07.780 --> 11:08.860
 It's an engineering.

11:08.860 --> 11:11.660
 I guess some people like glue together airplanes

11:11.660 --> 11:13.060
 and stuff like that.

11:13.060 --> 11:17.540
 But the bridges, it's such deeply honest work

11:17.540 --> 11:18.980
 because at the end of it,

11:18.980 --> 11:21.380
 you're gonna have to test that bridge

11:21.380 --> 11:24.100
 and you're gonna see how good your work was.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.660
 The little details, but also the big picture.

11:26.660 --> 11:28.700
 Do you use glue or no?

11:28.700 --> 11:30.740
 Yeah, use glue.

11:30.740 --> 11:32.180
 So it's not pure physics.

11:32.180 --> 11:36.760
 It's materials engineering too.

11:36.760 --> 11:40.260
 Because the way you want to do it is

11:40.260 --> 11:42.740
 you actually split the wood as thin as possible

11:42.740 --> 11:43.940
 and then glue it back together

11:43.940 --> 11:46.900
 because the glue is really strong,

11:46.900 --> 11:49.020
 except for the arches and things like that.

11:49.020 --> 11:50.700
 So you're building arch bridges,

11:50.700 --> 11:52.260
 which is a whole nother skill

11:52.260 --> 11:54.420
 because you have to bend the wood.

11:54.420 --> 11:55.260
 And it's so cool

11:55.260 --> 11:58.860
 because the thing can hold thousands of times its weight.

11:58.860 --> 12:03.860
 And then you get to watch it explode at a certain point

12:03.860 --> 12:07.420
 from the pressure and when you do a really good job,

12:07.420 --> 12:11.620
 it doesn't explode in a kind of some weak point

12:11.620 --> 12:14.660
 that you didn't anticipate just kind of starts cracking.

12:14.660 --> 12:17.260
 Everything cracks, everything explodes.

12:17.260 --> 12:20.420
 It's just pieces fly everywhere.

12:20.420 --> 12:23.500
 And it's literally hundreds of hours of work

12:23.500 --> 12:26.580
 just explode in front of you.

12:26.580 --> 12:29.380
 And that's a metaphor for life maybe.

12:29.380 --> 12:30.720
 And it's all for nothing,

12:30.720 --> 12:34.920
 except for the journey that you took to get there.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.560
 And no one understands.

12:37.560 --> 12:40.640
 Speaking of which, back to Nietzsche,

12:40.640 --> 12:42.240
 these questions are ridiculous.

12:42.240 --> 12:46.000
 So you're gonna have to try to figure out

12:46.000 --> 12:48.360
 what the heck I'm trying to do here.

12:48.360 --> 12:49.700
 So Nietzsche also said,

12:51.480 --> 12:53.160
 a line I love, which is,

12:53.160 --> 12:54.960
 and those who were seen dancing

12:54.960 --> 12:56.280
 were thought to be insane

12:56.280 --> 12:58.240
 by those who could not hear the music.

12:58.240 --> 13:02.520
 Do you, Rick Rubin, ever feel crazy?

13:02.520 --> 13:05.860
 Or maybe you're the one who's sane

13:05.860 --> 13:07.280
 and everybody else is crazy.

13:07.280 --> 13:11.920
 You know that the dancing, the joy of the music,

13:11.920 --> 13:13.960
 of just feeling the music

13:13.960 --> 13:15.820
 and everybody else just doesn't understand.

13:15.820 --> 13:17.680
 And this doesn't have to be literally about music.

13:17.680 --> 13:21.240
 This is about art, about creation.

13:21.240 --> 13:24.800
 I would say I feel different

13:24.800 --> 13:28.640
 and it's hard to say

13:28.640 --> 13:33.600
 it's like which side of the equation is crazy, you know?

13:33.600 --> 13:37.080
 Did you ever find a group of people

13:37.080 --> 13:39.140
 that you get, they get you?

13:39.140 --> 13:39.980
 Yes.

13:39.980 --> 13:42.080
 Is that what producing is essentially?

13:42.080 --> 13:43.480
 Is you try to find the moments

13:43.480 --> 13:45.520
 when you just get each other?

13:45.520 --> 13:46.360
 No.

13:46.360 --> 13:51.360
 I would say there are definitely certain artists

13:56.640 --> 13:58.380
 with certain temperaments.

13:58.380 --> 13:59.560
 When you're around them,

13:59.560 --> 14:02.360
 it feels like you can finish each other's sentences.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.840
 You know, just see the world the same way.

14:04.840 --> 14:06.120
 Comedians as well.

14:07.920 --> 14:12.920
 And that's not essential for the two of you together

14:13.060 --> 14:14.700
 creating something special.

14:14.700 --> 14:16.120
 No, no.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.120
 So it could be attention too?

14:18.120 --> 14:18.960
 It could be anything.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.480
 It could be any, there's no rules.

14:21.480 --> 14:24.160
 It'd be like, think of it like a coach.

14:24.160 --> 14:29.160
 A coach could bring what they have to bring

14:29.520 --> 14:31.640
 to any talented individual

14:31.640 --> 14:35.600
 and help them find their way.

14:36.900 --> 14:40.400
 And sometimes the right coach for the right athlete

14:40.400 --> 14:44.080
 really works and other times there's a mismatch.

14:44.080 --> 14:46.640
 Have you seen the movie Whiplash?

14:46.640 --> 14:47.480
 I did.

14:47.480 --> 14:48.300
 I saw it when it came out

14:48.300 --> 14:49.920
 so I don't really remember it well, but I did see it.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.640
 So there's a coach type of figure.

14:51.640 --> 14:52.480
 Yes.

14:52.480 --> 14:56.100
 Who is pushing a drummer to create,

14:56.100 --> 15:00.120
 to grow as a musician, but also to create something special.

15:00.120 --> 15:02.280
 I don't know if it's even special music skill wise,

15:02.280 --> 15:04.040
 it's a special moment.

15:04.040 --> 15:06.020
 I don't know what he's trying to create.

15:06.020 --> 15:08.120
 From one perspective, it's just an abusive,

15:08.120 --> 15:11.240
 a person who selfishly gets off on being abusive

15:11.240 --> 15:12.640
 to those he's with.

15:12.640 --> 15:15.680
 But from another perspective, the way I saw that movie,

15:15.680 --> 15:20.360
 is it's just the two right humans finding each other

15:20.360 --> 15:21.760
 at the right moment in life

15:21.760 --> 15:24.340
 and risking destroying each other in the process,

15:24.340 --> 15:27.700
 but maybe something beautiful will come of it.

15:29.140 --> 15:31.960
 Do you think that's a toxic relationship?

15:32.920 --> 15:37.600
 Or is there, does some of that movie resonate with you

15:37.600 --> 15:41.440
 as that sometimes is required to create art?

15:41.440 --> 15:43.640
 That kind of suffering.

15:43.640 --> 15:44.920
 Yeah, it doesn't.

15:44.920 --> 15:46.120
 Well, there's suffering involved,

15:46.120 --> 15:47.620
 but not that kind of suffering.

15:49.800 --> 15:50.640
 Not for me.

15:50.640 --> 15:53.160
 There are some people who that's their process

15:53.160 --> 15:55.320
 and that's whatever works.

15:55.320 --> 15:59.000
 There's no right answers for anything involved in art.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.400
 We're all trying experiments to find a way.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.220
 And even for the things that I work on,

16:04.220 --> 16:07.080
 I don't have a set way that I do anything.

16:07.080 --> 16:10.400
 I come to every project blank

16:10.400 --> 16:13.720
 and see,

16:15.120 --> 16:18.960
 I really listen to what the artist plays and says

16:18.960 --> 16:23.960
 and through what they explain they wanna do,

16:26.840 --> 16:29.380
 help find the best way to get there.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.920
 Was it implicit in the movie

16:32.920 --> 16:37.920
 that the mean teacher liked being a mean teacher?

16:37.920 --> 16:41.440
 You said the way you described it was

16:41.440 --> 16:43.360
 that he got off on treating people this way.

16:43.360 --> 16:44.560
 Do we know that to be the case?

16:44.560 --> 16:45.400
 I don't remember that in the movie.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.960
 No, but we sometimes project that onto people,

16:47.960 --> 16:52.240
 people who are really rough on students.

16:52.240 --> 16:54.100
 You start to think, well, maybe,

16:58.760 --> 17:01.040
 maybe that is fundamentally who they are

17:01.040 --> 17:03.520
 and if it's fundamentally who they are,

17:03.520 --> 17:05.200
 that there must be some pleasure in it

17:05.200 --> 17:07.500
 or it's an addiction of some sort.

17:07.500 --> 17:12.500
 But it could be also a deliberate choice

17:12.680 --> 17:14.040
 made by the teacher.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.400
 It also could be a lineage.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.040
 Like in the Zen tradition,

17:18.040 --> 17:23.040
 there are sort of the mean Roshi's

17:23.200 --> 17:27.400
 who if you do something wrong, take a physical action.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.760
 And it's just in the lineage,

17:30.760 --> 17:34.240
 it's considered that's how you teach.

17:34.240 --> 17:37.560
 I didn't come from that lineage.

17:37.560 --> 17:39.760
 So I'm much more of a,

17:39.760 --> 17:43.060
 I feel like it's more of a collaboration

17:43.060 --> 17:46.560
 between people working together to make the best thing.

17:46.560 --> 17:51.520
 It's not a boss slave relationship at all.

17:51.520 --> 17:55.080
 It's much more of a let's find our way.

17:55.080 --> 17:57.760
 And we agree at the beginning of the process

17:57.760 --> 18:02.160
 that if either of us or any of us

18:02.160 --> 18:04.480
 don't like what's happening, we say it.

18:04.480 --> 18:05.800
 And the goal is to keep working

18:05.800 --> 18:09.440
 till we get to a point where we're all really happy with it.

18:09.440 --> 18:11.040
 It's like if we make something

18:11.040 --> 18:13.080
 that an artist likes and I don't like,

18:13.080 --> 18:14.820
 or that I like and they don't like,

18:14.820 --> 18:16.240
 we haven't gone far enough.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.040
 In terms of lineage,

18:19.040 --> 18:21.280
 the ones that seek destruction

18:21.280 --> 18:22.560
 and the ones that seek happiness

18:22.560 --> 18:23.760
 all come from the same lineage.

18:23.760 --> 18:24.760
 We all came from fish.

18:24.760 --> 18:28.500
 So somewhere in you, deep down there,

18:28.500 --> 18:30.380
 there's the other stuff too.

18:30.380 --> 18:33.800
 It's just that you haven't been yet, by the way,

18:33.800 --> 18:35.280
 because you said every new project,

18:35.280 --> 18:37.240
 including maybe starting today,

18:39.560 --> 18:43.040
 is an opportunity to channel, to plug into something

18:43.040 --> 18:43.880
 that was always there

18:43.880 --> 18:46.080
 and you haven't gotten a chance to plug into.

18:46.080 --> 18:47.400
 You mentioned listening.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.600
 How do you listen to a person?

18:49.600 --> 18:51.440
 How do you hear a person?

18:51.440 --> 18:54.520
 When you first come in, like we just met,

18:55.560 --> 18:57.720
 what's the analysis happening?

18:57.720 --> 18:59.800
 But I mean, with me is one thing.

18:59.800 --> 19:00.960
 I'm an artist of sorts.

19:00.960 --> 19:05.960
 I program and I'm just, I'm human, I guess.

19:06.680 --> 19:08.680
 I guess we're all creating art.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.680
 How do you see, like, how do I bring out?

19:10.680 --> 19:12.660
 So for people who don't know,

19:14.820 --> 19:16.520
 I mean, obviously everyone knows

19:16.520 --> 19:19.040
 that you've produced some of the greatest records ever,

19:19.040 --> 19:24.040
 but the way I see that is you just brought out the best

19:24.960 --> 19:27.520
 in a lot of interesting artists.

19:27.520 --> 19:31.200
 And so in order to bring out the best in them,

19:31.200 --> 19:33.540
 you have to understand them.

19:33.540 --> 19:38.120
 You have to hear the music of their soul,

19:38.120 --> 19:39.800
 hopefully not being too romantic here,

19:39.800 --> 19:44.200
 but just like, is there something you can say

19:45.580 --> 19:48.600
 of how difficult that is, if there's a process,

19:48.600 --> 19:51.840
 if there's tricks, if it's luck?

19:52.840 --> 19:56.240
 I think it starts with this, again, coming in blank,

19:56.240 --> 19:59.440
 like not having any preconceived ideas,

19:59.440 --> 20:01.840
 being open and really listening,

20:01.840 --> 20:05.960
 listening and not thinking about what you're gonna say next

20:05.960 --> 20:08.140
 or what your opinion is or any, you know,

20:08.140 --> 20:12.040
 not basically being a recorder

20:12.040 --> 20:14.040
 and just hearing what comes in.

20:14.040 --> 20:16.180
 And then once you hear what comes in,

20:16.180 --> 20:19.160
 processing that information

20:19.160 --> 20:22.160
 and trying our best to do that

20:22.160 --> 20:25.780
 without any of the beliefs that we might have

20:25.780 --> 20:27.680
 to impact what that is.

20:28.720 --> 20:32.000
 If I ask you a question, I don't wanna hear what,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.080
 I don't wanna listen to you

20:34.080 --> 20:38.000
 and have any reaction happening when you're speaking.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.120
 I wanna be as neutral as possible.

20:41.120 --> 20:46.120
 For me, my goal is not to form an opinion,

20:46.960 --> 20:48.920
 it's to understand.

20:48.920 --> 20:52.440
 So if anything, I would draw you out further

20:52.440 --> 20:55.940
 and just ask questions to really understand.

20:56.960 --> 20:58.800
 And if you say, or if you say something

20:58.800 --> 21:03.800
 that somehow triggers me in a way that that's, you know,

21:05.560 --> 21:08.200
 I wonder how he came to that.

21:08.200 --> 21:11.080
 I wouldn't challenge you, I would ask,

21:11.080 --> 21:12.480
 like, how did you find that?

21:12.480 --> 21:14.920
 You know, how did you get to that place?

21:14.920 --> 21:17.360
 From a place of curiosity, you would try to figure out.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.360
 Yeah, I wanna understand who the person is.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.680
 And through questioning, we can usually get there.

21:22.680 --> 21:26.240
 Or through just spending time together,

21:26.240 --> 21:29.280
 you find out who the person is.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.760
 What about finding out and figuring out

21:31.760 --> 21:33.520
 how to then take the next steps

21:33.520 --> 21:36.100
 of bringing out the best in them?

21:37.800 --> 21:40.060
 Like, is it just trial and error?

21:40.060 --> 21:41.280
 Like, let's try this.

21:41.280 --> 21:42.840
 It's definitely trial and error.

21:42.840 --> 21:44.240
 It's always trial and error.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.720
 Are you afraid of making a mistake?

21:46.720 --> 21:48.760
 Like, let's add this instrument,

21:48.760 --> 21:50.440
 let's remove this instrument.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.560
 Let's add this line, let's remove this line.

21:52.560 --> 21:53.380
 Let's try.

21:53.380 --> 21:55.400
 And let's be open.

21:55.400 --> 21:59.840
 So one of the, we don't really have rules,

21:59.840 --> 22:03.000
 but one of the agreements in the studio is

22:03.000 --> 22:07.820
 any idea that anyone has will always demonstrate it,

22:07.820 --> 22:09.640
 will always try it.

22:09.640 --> 22:12.000
 Because I can describe to you an idea

22:12.000 --> 22:14.520
 and you can think, that's a terrible idea,

22:14.520 --> 22:16.380
 let's not do that.

22:16.380 --> 22:18.080
 And then I can play you the idea

22:18.080 --> 22:19.560
 and then you can say, oh, that's really good.

22:19.560 --> 22:22.020
 And it's completely different because we,

22:22.020 --> 22:25.080
 when we hear, when we're told something,

22:25.080 --> 22:28.840
 we have to imagine what that is

22:28.840 --> 22:30.920
 and the way you see something and imagine it

22:30.920 --> 22:32.280
 and the way I see something and imagine it

22:32.280 --> 22:33.480
 are completely different.

22:33.480 --> 22:36.400
 So you say a thing and now there's two humans

22:36.400 --> 22:39.200
 that play that thing in their mind differently,

22:39.200 --> 22:43.060
 in their imagination, and then there's a cool creative step

22:43.060 --> 22:44.640
 and when you actually do it,

22:44.640 --> 22:46.640
 to see how it differs in the imagination,

22:46.640 --> 22:49.200
 and then the difference or the commonality

22:49.200 --> 22:52.040
 will be like an exciting little discovery together.

22:52.040 --> 22:55.020
 Well, so many groups of people

22:55.020 --> 22:57.180
 making things together in a room,

22:57.180 --> 22:59.220
 one person will suggest something

22:59.220 --> 23:00.200
 and someone else in the room say,

23:00.200 --> 23:01.840
 ah, that doesn't sound like a good idea,

23:01.840 --> 23:03.880
 let's not do that, and then they move on.

23:05.200 --> 23:07.780
 The testing of every idea is really important

23:07.780 --> 23:09.760
 and that's how you get to see,

23:09.760 --> 23:11.640
 oh, that's not at all what I thought it was gonna be.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.420
 Happens to me all the time, I know,

23:13.420 --> 23:16.760
 because someone will suggest, why don't we do it like this?

23:16.760 --> 23:19.760
 And I'll think, that sounds bad,

23:19.760 --> 23:21.280
 and then I'll think, okay, let's try it,

23:21.280 --> 23:24.560
 and then we hear it, and then eight times out of 10,

23:24.560 --> 23:26.680
 it's nothing like I imagined and great.

23:28.160 --> 23:29.480
 And then you try not to have an ego

23:29.480 --> 23:31.260
 about the fact that you thought

23:31.260 --> 23:33.520
 it was not a good idea in your head.

23:33.520 --> 23:36.860
 There can't be any ego in this.

23:36.860 --> 23:41.860
 It doesn't, if everyone's there

23:41.860 --> 23:45.780
 with the purpose of making the best thing we can,

23:47.980 --> 23:49.260
 there's nothing else.

23:49.260 --> 23:51.960
 There are no, there can't be any boundaries to that.

23:53.580 --> 23:56.020
 So there's a moment I saw with,

23:56.020 --> 23:58.220
 I know you don't love talking

23:58.220 --> 24:00.900
 about previous things you've done,

24:00.900 --> 24:02.820
 but it's cool to dive in there every once in a while.

24:02.820 --> 24:04.060
 I'm fine to talk about anything.

24:04.060 --> 24:06.900
 To sample it, anything?

24:06.900 --> 24:07.740
 We'll see.

24:07.740 --> 24:09.140
 I have this pain I gotta talk now.

24:09.140 --> 24:12.540
 I'll think of something ridiculous

24:12.540 --> 24:14.880
 that would make you change your mind.

24:16.460 --> 24:19.820
 You mentioned, I saw a video of you with Jay Z

24:19.820 --> 24:23.400
 at Workaround 99 Problems where you suggested acapella,

24:23.400 --> 24:25.380
 opening the song with acapella,

24:25.380 --> 24:28.140
 just no instruments, just voice.

24:28.140 --> 24:33.140
 That to me, I mean, that's one of the characteristics

24:33.380 --> 24:36.380
 of the things, of the ways you've brought out

24:36.380 --> 24:38.680
 the best in artists is doing less.

24:38.680 --> 24:43.140
 Sort of the tending towards simplicity in some kind of way.

24:43.140 --> 24:45.620
 So that choice of acapella is really interesting

24:45.620 --> 24:47.580
 because I could see a lot of people think

24:47.580 --> 24:49.220
 that that's a bad idea,

24:50.180 --> 24:52.260
 but it turned out to be a really powerful idea.

24:52.260 --> 24:55.380
 Can you maybe talk about the simplicity,

24:55.380 --> 24:58.900
 how to find simplicity, why you find simplicity is beautiful.

24:58.900 --> 25:00.820
 It does appear to be beautiful.

25:00.820 --> 25:01.840
 What is that?

25:01.840 --> 25:04.180
 Yeah, I don't know where it comes from.

25:04.180 --> 25:07.420
 It has been with me from the beginning of my work,

25:07.420 --> 25:10.800
 the very first album I ever produced,

25:10.800 --> 25:12.820
 the credit I took was reduced by me

25:12.820 --> 25:16.540
 instead of produced by me for that reason.

25:16.540 --> 25:19.460
 I like the idea of getting to the essential

25:19.460 --> 25:24.460
 and I have a better idea now that I've done it for a while,

25:24.580 --> 25:28.900
 but at the time it was purely an instinctual thing.

25:28.900 --> 25:33.060
 And part of it is a sonic, there's a sonic benefit,

25:33.060 --> 25:38.060
 which is the less elements you have, you can hear each

25:39.020 --> 25:42.900
 of the ones that are there and they can sound better.

25:42.900 --> 25:47.180
 And the less there are, the more space they could have

25:47.180 --> 25:49.860
 around them and the more you can hear their personality.

25:49.860 --> 25:54.860
 If you were to record 10 people playing the same guitar part

25:55.400 --> 25:58.660
 and you listened to it, it would sound like guitar.

25:58.660 --> 26:02.740
 And if you record one person playing a guitar part,

26:02.740 --> 26:05.580
 it sounds like a person playing the guitar.

26:05.580 --> 26:07.400
 It's different than just guitar.

26:08.300 --> 26:13.300
 And often in the studio, the idea of building upon things

26:14.500 --> 26:18.440
 and adding layers to thicken, to make it sound bigger,

26:18.440 --> 26:23.440
 sometimes the more things you add, the smaller it gets.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.460
 So a lot of it is counterintuitive

26:27.460 --> 26:30.940
 until you just in practice see what works.

26:30.940 --> 26:33.740
 Try it, to try removing stuff until it's just right.

26:33.740 --> 26:38.740
 It's the Einstein thing, make it as simple as possible,

26:39.260 --> 26:40.820
 but not simpler.

26:40.820 --> 26:44.460
 That's such a, like finding a stopping place,

26:44.460 --> 26:47.460
 just keep chopping away and chopping away.

26:47.460 --> 26:49.580
 Yeah, there's something we also like to do

26:49.580 --> 26:51.460
 called the ruthless edit, which is,

26:51.460 --> 26:55.100
 let's say you're at a point where it can work for anything,

26:55.100 --> 26:57.300
 but I'll give you the example with an album.

26:57.300 --> 27:02.300
 We've recorded 25 songs.

27:02.580 --> 27:05.100
 We think the album is gonna have 10.

27:05.100 --> 27:08.080
 Instead of picking our favorite 10,

27:08.080 --> 27:11.900
 we limit it to what are the five or six

27:11.900 --> 27:13.260
 that we can't live without.

27:14.300 --> 27:19.300
 So going past even the goal to get to the real heart of it

27:20.780 --> 27:22.500
 and then see, okay, we have these five or six

27:22.500 --> 27:24.260
 that we can't live without.

27:24.260 --> 27:28.220
 Now, what would we add to that

27:28.220 --> 27:31.220
 that makes it better and not worse?

27:34.780 --> 27:38.540
 It's just, it puts you in a different frame

27:38.540 --> 27:42.860
 when you start with building instead of removing.

27:42.860 --> 27:45.380
 And you might find that there's nothing you need to add.

27:45.380 --> 27:48.900
 Sometimes, sometimes something happens

27:48.900 --> 27:51.360
 when you get to the real essence.

27:51.360 --> 27:52.720
 Then when you start adding things back,

27:52.720 --> 27:56.820
 it becomes clear that it was just supposed to be

27:56.820 --> 27:59.180
 this tight little thing.

28:00.140 --> 28:02.220
 Can I ask you like a therapy session question?

28:02.220 --> 28:05.660
 So you mentioned somewhere that one way

28:05.660 --> 28:09.940
 to kind of think about music to get into music

28:09.940 --> 28:12.920
 is to look at the top like 100 albums of all time

28:12.920 --> 28:14.940
 and just go down the list and like,

28:14.940 --> 28:17.620
 just take it all in like one piece of artwork.

28:17.620 --> 28:20.100
 So I was doing that for a while.

28:20.100 --> 28:21.500
 It's a cool experiment,

28:21.500 --> 28:23.420
 because unfortunately I have to admit

28:23.420 --> 28:28.040
 I've gotten lazy and stopped taking in albums as albums.

28:29.700 --> 28:32.780
 And I looked at one interesting top 100 list,

28:32.780 --> 28:36.860
 top 500 actually, which is put together by Rolling Stone.

28:36.860 --> 28:39.780
 And they put, this is the therapy session part,

28:39.780 --> 28:41.300
 and this has to do with simplicity too.

28:41.300 --> 28:44.100
 They put Marvin Gaye's What's Going On at number one.

28:44.100 --> 28:44.960
 Spoiler alert.

28:46.100 --> 28:50.940
 So I'd like to maybe get your opinion on that choice.

28:50.940 --> 28:53.500
 The reason that Marvin Gaye is really interesting,

28:54.540 --> 28:57.780
 it'd actually be cool to play What's Going On in a second,

28:57.780 --> 29:02.660
 but when you just listen to his like acapella,

29:02.660 --> 29:06.080
 just listen to his voice, it is really good.

29:06.080 --> 29:09.580
 Like people, it makes me wonder if it's possible

29:09.580 --> 29:13.220
 to pull off like most of his songs with no instruments.

29:13.220 --> 29:17.800
 Like in many parts, there's so much soul

29:17.800 --> 29:21.820
 in just Mercy, Mercy, Me, What's Going On.

29:21.820 --> 29:23.700
 There's so many songs that you could just be like,

29:23.700 --> 29:28.180
 I wonder if you could just like, just go raw,

29:28.180 --> 29:30.380
 or maybe in parts, or maybe do what you do with Jay Z,

29:30.380 --> 29:31.420
 just open up with nothing.

29:31.420 --> 29:33.740
 Anyway, there's something so powerful

29:33.740 --> 29:36.180
 to a great soulful voice.

29:36.180 --> 29:37.800
 Do you mind if I play it real quick?

29:37.800 --> 29:38.640
 No, please.

29:38.640 --> 29:39.480
 What's going on?

29:39.480 --> 29:41.340
 This is probably one of my favorite songs.

29:41.340 --> 29:42.440
 I mean, it's up there.

29:43.540 --> 29:44.380
 Hey, what's happening?

29:44.380 --> 29:45.200
 What's up, brother?

29:45.200 --> 29:46.040
 What's up?

29:46.040 --> 29:46.880
 Hey, how you doing?

29:46.880 --> 29:49.280
 Hey man.

29:49.280 --> 29:54.020
 Wow.

29:54.020 --> 29:58.860
 Hey man.

29:58.860 --> 30:00.820
 Mother, mother,

30:00.820 --> 30:02.620
 That voice.

30:02.620 --> 30:08.660
 There's too many of you to cry.

30:08.660 --> 30:11.660
 Brother, brother, brother.

30:11.660 --> 30:14.440
 There's far too many of you to die.

30:14.440 --> 30:16.840
 there's some just very subtle backing vocals

30:29.880 --> 30:30.600
 this one hurts

30:33.400 --> 30:35.160
 father father we don't need to escalate

30:35.160 --> 30:45.720
 i wonder who the father he's talking about is

30:46.920 --> 30:52.040
 oh that's interesting i mean i have so for people who don't know his his own father ended up

30:53.240 --> 30:59.880
 uh killing marvin gay yeah i mean that one is really pain i mean for a lot of people your

30:59.880 --> 31:03.880
 relationship with your father your mother i mean there's different dynamics but there's

31:03.880 --> 31:07.960
 it's almost like part of life is resolving some kind of complex puzzle you have

31:08.600 --> 31:12.600
 or the people you love the people close to you or the people who are not there all those kinds

31:12.600 --> 31:18.600
 of things that's so much pain in that we don't need to escalate father father i never thought

31:18.600 --> 31:24.760
 if it's i always thought it's his father directly yeah i don't get that it could be but i don't i

31:24.760 --> 31:36.120
 feel like it's a more um masculine spirituality like a father figure or just broadly some kind

31:36.120 --> 31:43.160
 of spirituality could be like god father god mother god you know like could be i don't know

31:43.880 --> 31:51.080
 but there's there's so much it's like both hope and melancholy you seeing war is not the answer

31:51.080 --> 31:56.200
 it's like you you don't tell your father war is not your your blood father war is not the answer

31:56.200 --> 32:01.240
 it's strange conversation it's a bigger conversation they're not personal don't you

32:01.240 --> 32:10.360
 think it feels like war if one is personal what's the difference between is the war is personal too

32:10.920 --> 32:17.800
 it's only leaders think about war in a geopolitical sense yeah when people that fight wars you lose

32:17.800 --> 32:22.760
 your brothers you lose i mean you death is just right there so it might feel just like that but

32:22.760 --> 32:28.520
 yeah there is a dance between like the personal and like talking to the entirety of the society

32:28.520 --> 32:37.640
 it's like john lennon imagine like also a song where is that is that a hopeful is that cynical

32:39.000 --> 32:46.920
 is it like melancholy like heartbroken like you you hope you wish things would be a certain way

32:46.920 --> 32:52.120
 and they're not yeah i don't know i don't know john lennon is giving up on the world in imagine

32:52.680 --> 32:56.600
 yeah i don't know you know it's a it's an interesting question there's another uh

32:56.600 --> 33:04.120
 john lennon lyric um in let me think of what it is take me a second

33:08.840 --> 33:13.960
 and different songs keep coming into my head the one that i'm looking and you keep pressing next

33:13.960 --> 33:28.040
 um across the universe um nothing's going to change my world and when i hear that

33:29.560 --> 33:34.680
 i hear it as hopeless but i don't think i don't believe that that's

33:36.200 --> 33:40.360
 well it may be how he meant it but i don't think that's how it's normally taken

33:40.360 --> 33:46.280
 and it's also the taker is important i'm generally optimistic and hopeful so i i always like look for

33:46.280 --> 33:52.840
 the hope and the actually the harshest love uh heartbreak songs are always somehow hopeful to me

33:52.840 --> 34:02.760
 that's a love song uh to me like a song about losing love is is a song about the great capacity

34:02.760 --> 34:07.880
 for love in the human heart that's what i hear so to me losing love is exciting because it's

34:07.880 --> 34:12.840
 like that means you really cared that means you felt something you feel something you can sit in

34:12.840 --> 34:20.680
 that pain and that pain is a reminder what it means to be human when you're that um what is it uh

34:20.680 --> 34:25.320
 we're just listening uh the only man who could have reached me was the son of a preacher man

34:25.320 --> 34:30.600
 so see um it's like that early love or something or partially sexual or whatever that's not as

34:30.600 --> 34:36.440
 interesting to me it's fun it's great but it's not as interesting to me as it is to me

34:36.440 --> 34:41.240
 it's fun it's great but it's that heartbreak that's the reminder that it can go deep

34:41.240 --> 34:47.560
 although that's a damn good song have you ever heard the uh detroit mix of the marvin gay album

34:48.120 --> 34:57.000
 no call it up how by far better mind blowing i just heard it recently blew my mind

34:57.000 --> 35:04.840
 oh wow reverb distant

35:04.840 --> 35:06.840
 interesting

35:06.840 --> 35:08.840
 there's

35:08.840 --> 35:16.840
 there's far too many of you

35:16.840 --> 35:18.840
 it feels like it's all around the room more

35:18.840 --> 35:36.840
 to bring some loving here today

35:36.840 --> 35:38.840
 more voices more voices

35:38.840 --> 35:52.840
 he's layering his own vocals

35:52.840 --> 36:08.840
 just like there's multiple people singing

36:08.840 --> 36:22.840
 don't punish me with brutality talk to me so you can see oh what's going on that's beautiful yeah

36:22.840 --> 36:27.480
 seems to have more energy if you if you listen to the whole album even even though you just said

36:27.480 --> 36:33.000
 you don't listen albums anymore the detroit mix of the whole album changes the album a lot

36:33.000 --> 36:39.160
 i mean that that felt uh so that's the opposite of a cappella i would say yes because it's saying

36:39.160 --> 36:46.600
 it's it's um there's layers there's um and that maybe i don't know if you remember but

36:47.800 --> 36:53.720
 if memory serves me uh correct here he produces this own album here marvin gay was the producer

36:53.720 --> 36:59.080
 on this i believe i believe so and this one sounds more like it's a get together and the

36:59.080 --> 37:04.280
 whole album sounds more like a get together where it's a group of people in a room playing music

37:04.280 --> 37:11.480
 together whereas the album version sounds more like an out like a recording this sounds less

37:11.480 --> 37:16.360
 like a recording and a little more like a party now you had a series of conversations with paul

37:16.360 --> 37:22.120
 mccartney which is amazing that people should should watch but is is there this is continuing

37:22.120 --> 37:29.240
 our therapy session is there a case to be made that uh what's going on is number one album above

37:29.240 --> 37:36.920
 the beatles uh white album or abbey road above pet sounds can you still manage case there's

37:36.920 --> 37:43.000
 there's always a case i mean there's always a case every there's no uh in reality in art there is no

37:43.000 --> 37:50.680
 um there's no metric that makes sense so um you could put numbers on things but it's like

37:50.680 --> 37:58.280
 is this apple better than this peach like it's not really a fair comparison but if you just had

37:58.280 --> 38:04.440
 to keep one to represent the human species that's the way i think to the aliens so i think it's a

38:04.440 --> 38:09.320
 very personal decision i don't i think you can make you can make your choice to represent the

38:09.320 --> 38:14.440
 human species and i'll make mine you know well i would pick the beatles over the beach boys so

38:14.440 --> 38:19.320
 that's my if i became dictator of the world i was talking to the aliens but i do think that

38:19.320 --> 38:24.360
 aliens but i don't know the full historical context to the impact of the music i don't

38:24.360 --> 38:30.200
 know if that's something to consider like this kind of thought experiment of imagine what it was

38:30.200 --> 38:37.720
 like back then to create to go into the studio to do such interesting work in the studio

38:39.240 --> 38:45.000
 as opposed to like listening to just as a pop song almost from because i've never been able

38:45.000 --> 38:54.200
 to understand uh beach boys god only knows the song god only knows god only knows but all of

38:54.200 --> 39:03.080
 it the album the pet sounds just in my room was uh in my room that's all um is that what's your

39:03.080 --> 39:09.880
 favorite on the album that sounds album that sounds um the opening track do you mind if i

39:09.880 --> 39:21.480
 play it please it's it's it's too fun that's part of their trip though the you uh you open

39:21.480 --> 39:32.840
 the heart with the fun it's possible original mono and stereo mix versions i don't know what's

39:32.840 --> 39:46.680
 the opening song wouldn't it be nice yeah that's the song

40:14.040 --> 40:18.120
 we could say good night and stay together wouldn't that be nice wouldn't it be nice

40:18.120 --> 40:23.240
 wake up together but we're not there's heartbreak in this one too

40:24.520 --> 40:30.920
 still to me like george harris like um uh is that the way that album while my guitar gently weeps

40:30.920 --> 40:38.440
 i mean that um with the beatles it's so hard to depending on the day i'll i'll say a very different

40:38.440 --> 40:43.720
 song that's my favorite song but i often return to while my guitar gently weeps is my favorite song

40:43.720 --> 40:48.680
 spectacular spectacular anything george harrison honestly something something in the way she moves

40:51.160 --> 40:55.800
 the bet i what would you classify that there's like several beatle songs categories of beatles

40:55.800 --> 41:01.000
 categories of beatles songs so that's like the melancholy love songs or ballads or something like

41:01.000 --> 41:10.280
 that um yesterday let it be what's do you have favorites so from your like how have you changed

41:10.280 --> 41:17.320
 as a man as a human being as a musician and music producer ever having done that lengthy interaction

41:17.320 --> 41:27.880
 with with mccartney hmm anytime you're around someone who's such a hero and you spend time

41:27.880 --> 41:33.160
 with them and they're a human being it helps put perspective on everything you know that they're

41:33.160 --> 41:39.400
 just human that well obviously i mean every everyone's just human and um but i remember

41:39.400 --> 41:44.680
 the first time i got to see paul mccartney play live it was in a stadium of 70 000 people

41:44.680 --> 41:51.320
 and he started playing and i started crying and i couldn't believe i was in even with 70 000 people

41:51.320 --> 41:57.160
 i couldn't believe i that this man walks the earth and that i'm in the same place as him

41:57.720 --> 42:03.240
 and he's the person who wrote that and played that and now he's here playing it for us

42:03.240 --> 42:13.960
 it's mind blowing that's the voice that's the it's overwhelming is it inspiring or is it um

42:15.080 --> 42:21.240
 like because sometimes when you have and i've gotten a chance to me i mean i love people in

42:21.240 --> 42:26.360
 general like every every person is fascinating to me but yeah when you've been a fan for a long time

42:26.360 --> 42:35.960
 and you meet a person uh sort of uh i'll just remove present company is you um it's like oh

42:35.960 --> 42:42.360
 they're just human so there's both it's both inspiring that just a simple human can achieve

42:42.360 --> 42:50.760
 such beautiful things but it's also like almost wishing there were gods moving in around us it's

42:50.760 --> 42:58.680
 it's somehow peaceful this is it's more uh comforting to know that there's you know uh

42:58.680 --> 43:04.440
 there's bigger fish i'm just a small fish and then there's bigger fish and it will take care

43:04.440 --> 43:10.040
 of the ocean for us i think we're all capable of being big fish i don't think that there are

43:10.040 --> 43:17.320
 special people i don't think it it's like that i i would make a case so the variety

43:17.320 --> 43:24.520
 of artists that you worked with and brought the best out of it does seem the year out of this

43:24.520 --> 43:35.320
 world so do you think you would know like if you're the same kind of species maybe you're

43:35.320 --> 43:41.080
 just a meat vehicle and you're channeling ideas from somewhere else i feel like i'm channeling

43:41.080 --> 43:46.520
 ideas from somewhere else 100 but i think have you asked questions about where from i believe

43:46.520 --> 43:57.160
 we i believe we all are though you know i believe we are um we're vehicles for information that when

43:57.160 --> 44:01.560
 it's ready to come through it comes through and the people who have good antennas pick up the

44:01.560 --> 44:08.120
 signal but um if i'm sure you've had an experience in your life where you've had an idea for something

44:08.120 --> 44:13.320
 and you've not acted on it and eventually someone else does it and it's not because they're doing

44:13.320 --> 44:17.080
 and it's not because they're doing it because you had the idea and they stole your idea it's because

44:17.880 --> 44:22.840
 the time has come for that idea and if you don't do it someone else is going to it's

44:22.840 --> 44:28.600
 being broadcast by whatever the source whatever the source is uh yeah i tend to

44:30.440 --> 44:35.160
 i tend to see humans as not quite special in that way yeah it's it's different kinds of antennas

44:35.160 --> 44:43.800
 walking around listening to ideas and ideas that are i like the the notion of uh richard dawkins of memes

44:43.800 --> 44:48.760
 or it's kind of the ideas of the organisms and they're just using our brains to multiply to

44:49.480 --> 44:55.160
 to select to compete to to evolve and humans we really want to hold on to the

44:55.160 --> 45:00.760
 specialness of our body of our mind but it's it's really the ideas so for a group when was born

45:00.760 --> 45:09.320
 two centuries ago you wouldn't be a music producer you'd be or i mean maybe but you have an antenna

45:10.440 --> 45:16.280
 and if no signal is coming in uh or you'd be hearing a potentially a different signal

45:17.960 --> 45:24.200
 is there um i think we all have our own antenna for whatever it is that we you know maybe not

45:24.200 --> 45:31.080
 everyone has tuned into their antenna to see what it is that their strength and bringing through is

45:31.080 --> 45:35.960
 i'm lucky in that it found me because i didn't know that it was a i didn't even know this was a job

45:36.920 --> 45:44.680
 i sometimes wonder i mean a lot of young people a lot of people wonder like what's the purpose

45:44.680 --> 45:56.280
 and the the specs of my antenna what am i put on this earth to do like if um you know i i

45:56.280 --> 46:02.600
 can live a thousand lives there's so many trajectories and imagine the greatest possible

46:02.600 --> 46:09.080
 trajectory that reveals the the most beautiful thing i can possibly create in this world live

46:09.080 --> 46:15.800
 the most beautiful way uh what is that i feel like that's a good exercise to think about

46:17.080 --> 46:23.400
 um because it's also liberating to think that you can do anything i mean that

46:24.200 --> 46:30.760
 um more and more i suppose that's kind of life it's like society is pushing conformity on you

46:30.760 --> 46:36.120
 you know i thought i i had my own flavor of conformity i thought i'm supposed to be following

46:36.120 --> 46:42.280
 and then early on i would say like in the late 20s you realize wait a minute you don't have to

46:42.280 --> 46:47.320
 tell you don't have to do what teachers tell you to do what parents tell you to do what

46:47.880 --> 46:55.400
 society tells you do you can like um i would never wear a suit if i listened to like my colleagues

46:55.400 --> 47:04.440
 and community who think a suit is like the symbol of uh what is it a symbol of conformity actually

47:04.440 --> 47:09.880
 which is hilarious but uh it's actually a kind of rebellion and everything else like of that nature

47:09.880 --> 47:17.480
 doing doing these silly podcasts like um i have a question i have to ask sure because you brought

47:17.480 --> 47:26.520
 up the suit yeah uh do you wear the suit is this your daily uniform outside of podcasting so uh for

47:26.520 --> 47:33.640
 the longest time it was some kind of suit and then recently i mean coinciding with going to texas

47:33.640 --> 47:41.320
 there's a i'm such a loner i'm an introvert and there's a bit of a hiding from the world when i

47:42.040 --> 47:51.480
 wear other stuff i really want to um to not make fame recognition

47:53.080 --> 48:01.400
 money all those things a motivation at all and the world kind of wants you to make those motivations

48:01.400 --> 48:06.840
 not not the world but i would say maybe the western world and maybe america maybe a capitalist system

48:06.840 --> 48:16.600
 does but that's a choice to buy into that or not right it takes a brave person a person of character

48:16.600 --> 48:22.760
 to not buy in and i'm i'm like a like a baby deer trying to find his legs you don't have to

48:23.320 --> 48:28.120
 buy in because i love people and i think i'm kind of an idiot and so when other people

48:28.120 --> 48:35.800
 say do this and do that it uh there's a there is a pressure there it's actually very difficult to

48:36.600 --> 48:43.240
 not listen necessarily to the advice of others and yet keep yourself fragile and open to the world

48:44.440 --> 48:50.600
 it's easy to be like i'm always right you know just kind of sticking a ground but if you want

48:50.600 --> 48:55.640
 to be like vulnerable if you want to connect with people and just wear your heart on your sleeve

48:55.640 --> 49:01.800
 then you're going to listen to them i mean that's the double edged sword of it and uh but then again

49:01.800 --> 49:08.600
 that pain like if you don't let it destroy you can grow grow from that has fame affected you at all

49:08.600 --> 49:14.680
 did you unplug from the system at some point same i've always been sort of removed i don't

49:14.680 --> 49:22.920
 feel like i'm part of any system do you feel famous um i'm aware that when i go out people

49:22.920 --> 49:29.720
 will you know say nice things to me which is great but that's about it that's about as far as

49:29.720 --> 49:34.040
 but it doesn't affect your art about your creativity or your thoughts like when you're

49:34.040 --> 49:42.600
 sitting alone and thinking about the world it can't it's a destructive force the the thing

49:43.240 --> 49:49.400
 the reason that you're who you are and the reason that you're finding the success you're finding

49:49.400 --> 49:54.280
 is because you've been true to yourself to get to that stage so to start changing that

49:55.240 --> 49:59.960
 to conform to either conform to someone else's idea what you should be doing

50:01.000 --> 50:06.840
 it just seems like uh it doesn't make sense do you have a sense of who you are because i don't

50:06.840 --> 50:13.640
 necessarily have a i don't know i i know that i really like making good things and i know that i'm

50:13.640 --> 50:22.280
 um crazy about it in that um it's like an obsession and i want things to be as good as

50:22.280 --> 50:28.360
 they could be whatever it is and if i'm if i finish a music project and i have a window of

50:28.360 --> 50:33.640
 time where i'm not working on music i might be moving the furniture around in the house you know

50:33.640 --> 50:41.640
 i'm always looking for a prod a creative outlet to find a way to make something better or there

50:41.640 --> 50:46.280
 was a period of time where i was in a weird corporate situation that was uh

50:49.480 --> 50:57.240
 that didn't allow me to flourish and i turned i focused the creativity and on myself and i

50:57.240 --> 51:01.720
 lost a bunch of weight and changed my life and so that was the kind of art like the you've gone

51:01.720 --> 51:06.680
 through a whole process of losing weight getting in shape getting healthy that was a kind of creative

51:06.680 --> 51:12.840
 act it certainly was it wasn't an intentional creative act but i had a lot of energy and i just

51:13.800 --> 51:20.680
 a series of events happened i read a book at the time that was my heaviest i weighed about 318

51:20.680 --> 51:25.640
 pounds yeah and i'd never been i'd been sedentary my whole life basically laying on a couch working

51:25.640 --> 51:32.920
 on music so i've never been physically active in my life and i read a book about a guy named stew

51:32.920 --> 51:38.920
 middleman a runner who ran a thousand miles in 11 days and i thought wow i you know get out of

51:38.920 --> 51:45.160
 breath walking to the corner and another human being can run a thousand miles in 11 days i feel

51:45.160 --> 51:50.920
 like i have bad information you know i'm doing clearly i'm doing something wrong and um and i

51:50.920 --> 51:56.680
 reached out to a person that stew mentioned in the book phil maffatone who's a legend i i really

51:56.680 --> 52:03.240
 appreciate him as well he's math 180 method too he's such an interesting i think he focuses on

52:03.240 --> 52:10.920
 heart rate uh training and he was the first person to talk about um essentially a

52:12.760 --> 52:22.120
 low carbs paleo yeah keto diet 40 40 years ago for a person who's going to be healthy who can

52:22.120 --> 52:29.480
 exercise and actually perform at an early level he's the first person when i um you know talked

52:29.480 --> 52:35.080
 about heart rate training him and other endurance athletes he influenced he gave me permission to

52:35.080 --> 52:41.640
 like run slower yeah it's the first time i realized oh i can run long distances if i just

52:41.640 --> 52:48.520
 run slower and then take that seriously and i actually fell in love with running very much so

52:48.520 --> 52:54.360
 because for me everyone's different but for me the love of running happens in the longer distances

52:54.360 --> 52:59.960
 yeah did you read born to run great book amazing book there is something special about running

53:01.080 --> 53:06.520
 and everybody has their own their own journey with it and even ultra marathon running those

53:06.520 --> 53:16.200
 kinds of things it's a it is like many journeys one that can pull you in like you won't be the

53:16.200 --> 53:21.560
 same person after and i i try to be deliberate about making deliberate about making choices

53:23.000 --> 53:29.000
 after which you'll not be the same person and so i'm nervous about like the ultra marathon running

53:29.000 --> 53:39.880
 world i have to talk to you about johnny cash i mean when people ask me what my

53:39.880 --> 53:47.400
 favorite musical thing is of all time i'm

53:51.400 --> 53:55.080
 you know it's a very difficult question to answer of course but i'm pretty quick

53:55.720 --> 54:03.960
 if i'm not allowed to pick anything by tom ways i'm pretty quick to say hurt by johnny cash

54:03.960 --> 54:08.120
 the performance the whatever you call it whatever the heck that is because that's

54:08.120 --> 54:17.000
 not just a song covered by an artist that's a human being at the end of their life

54:18.840 --> 54:26.920
 that the rawness of that the i mean just the there's also a music video which for a lot of

54:26.920 --> 54:36.600
 people adds a lot to it uh for me just the music alone is i mean the guitar every choice on that

54:36.600 --> 54:41.800
 see the the few things i've heard about it it seemed like almost accidental i mean like little

54:41.800 --> 54:50.280
 subtle choices here and there can you maybe comment on that um to to the degree i i think

54:50.280 --> 54:56.440
 you had a huge role in sort of bringing johnny cash back from from a different part of his life

54:56.440 --> 55:01.560
 it's like bringing something out that wasn't there before and it was it was it was incredible

55:01.560 --> 55:08.440
 it was a celebration of a really special musician and a totally new kind of celebration now hurt is

55:08.440 --> 55:13.720
 just one of the songs that's that's a that's an amazing celebration of johnny cash but hurt is

55:13.720 --> 55:21.960
 like at the at the at the peak of that so what was that like putting that song together okay maybe

55:21.960 --> 55:27.240
 maybe uh it might be nice to listen to it because i freaking love that song and as a guitarist

55:27.240 --> 55:38.440
 i just the simplicity of it uh it seems like every choice contributes to the greatness of the song

55:48.440 --> 55:51.080
 simple it's crisp but it's dark too

55:51.080 --> 55:57.480
 i hurt myself today it's one of the greatest opening lines of any song

56:01.640 --> 56:06.520
 to see if i still feel yeah i'm talking about the lyrics i don't even mean the performance the words

56:15.480 --> 56:20.040
 but those words out of Trent Reznor are not the same they have a different meaning

56:20.040 --> 56:23.000
 coming out of johnny cash's mouth

56:23.000 --> 56:31.560
 try to kill it all away but i remember everything

56:31.560 --> 56:42.200
 what have i become what have i become my sweetest friend

56:42.200 --> 57:01.160
 written probably for a young man i think he was 20 when he wrote it

57:01.160 --> 57:22.680
 the way the guitarist played the choice of instrument the layers there

57:22.680 --> 57:33.240
 the uh the freedom to give him to use the voice that's um fading it's not fading it's changing

57:34.040 --> 57:42.040
 maybe he's losing some aspects of his voice and it's it's almost like shaking a little bit

57:42.920 --> 57:45.640
 and it's a little bit out of tune in parts

57:45.640 --> 57:54.360
 uh how much of that was deliberate how much was like how do you give johnny castor freedom to

57:54.360 --> 58:01.480
 to do that how do you find that together is there any insights you can give i think it's a it's a

58:01.480 --> 58:10.440
 case almost of like the right pairing the right role with the right actor you could say the the

58:10.440 --> 58:16.120
 song lyrics that the reason we chose the song was because the lyrics purely about the lyrics

58:17.160 --> 58:21.240
 and at that point in time both johnny and i would send each other songs of possible

58:21.240 --> 58:29.080
 ideas to record and um that was one that i sent him and he didn't respond to initially i sent i

58:29.080 --> 58:34.120
 would send him see at that time we would burn cds and i would send him like cd of 20 songs or 25

58:34.120 --> 58:38.520
 songs and then and he would send them to me he burned a cd for johnny cash and you sent him

58:38.520 --> 58:44.920
 uh of different songs of like songs to consider recording yeah um and we would send these back

58:44.920 --> 58:51.800
 and forth and then that i had hurt on one of the ones that i sent him and he didn't respond and

58:51.800 --> 58:58.680
 usually if he didn't respond we didn't go back to it you know and that one i remember i sent it

58:58.680 --> 59:05.880
 again and i put it first on the next on the next cd and um and when when we spoke about when he

59:05.880 --> 59:10.440
 listened to cd again he didn't respond i said check out that first song and i really feel like that one

59:10.440 --> 59:15.800
 could be good what did you see in that song it's the lyrics it's the lyrics because i feel like

59:15.800 --> 59:25.400
 nobody there's very few people in the world that would see these lyrics in johnny cash's mouth and

59:25.400 --> 59:32.040
 think this is a good idea including for president yeah i know that trant was trant had trepidations

59:32.040 --> 59:38.280
 in the evening um but if you listen to the words if you forget the music and if you get what if

59:38.280 --> 59:44.680
 you forget what nine ish nail sounds like and you just read it like a poem and then you imagine

59:45.480 --> 59:53.960
 a 70 year old man reading these lyrics it'll be it'll be profound it's profound so that was the

59:55.480 --> 1:00:00.760
 based on lyrics that started the journey and then at this point in time johnny was not in great

1:00:00.760 --> 1:00:08.200
 health and uh sometimes i would go to nashville and record with him at his house sometimes he

1:00:08.200 --> 1:00:14.600
 would come to california but he was coming to california less regularly and because there was

1:00:14.600 --> 1:00:21.080
 there were so many songs we wanted to try he would start sometimes recording just a straight

1:00:21.080 --> 1:00:27.160
 acoustic version like you'd have someone play guitar he would sing and they would send those

1:00:27.160 --> 1:00:33.080
 to me and we would discuss like is this one to build on um and that was when we said i don't

1:00:33.080 --> 1:00:36.440
 want to record this one until we're together i feel like we should do this one together

1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:41.640
 so on the next trip to california we recorded it at my at my old house

1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:45.820
 and

1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:55.240
 i mean all the songs we recorded felt special so i can't say this one felt special

1:00:55.240 --> 1:01:02.440
 but lyrically it just it's more the the lyrics have such a profound

1:01:05.480 --> 1:01:12.760
 sense of regret what have i become yeah and to hear when you're 20 years old talking about regret

1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:17.480
 yeah it's heartbreaking but it's heartbreaking in a different way because you have your whole

1:01:17.480 --> 1:01:23.160
 life to figure it out when you're looking back over your life at the end of your life with regret

1:01:23.160 --> 1:01:30.840
 it's brutal yeah it's brutal so that was the initial spark of doing it and then we when we

1:01:30.840 --> 1:01:41.240
 recorded it i believe it was um two guitar players if i remember correctly maybe even three um smoky

1:01:41.240 --> 1:01:50.040
 hormel matt sweeney and mike campbell i believe and ben montench was playing the piano in my living

1:01:50.040 --> 1:01:59.000
 room as we were doing it and we cut the basic track and with johnny singing and then johnny

1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:04.840
 probably sang over that basic track a few more times and then we comped his vocal and then

1:02:08.840 --> 1:02:13.240
 built up the drama and you didn't get to the part but at the end of the song it gets very loud the

1:02:13.240 --> 1:02:19.960
 music gets very loud it's subtle because it's not anything that takes your ear and the vocal is so

1:02:20.440 --> 1:02:23.880
 powerful that you don't really think about what's going on but it's building the whole time it's

1:02:23.880 --> 1:02:33.880
 building and it even gets distorted at the end it gets really uh like over overpowering and that's

1:02:33.880 --> 1:02:54.680
 part of the emotion of it you know it's uh i hear almost anger and frustration

1:03:11.560 --> 1:03:18.680
 and it just rings out the clean vocal i mean it's so simple so incredible and it's interesting to

1:03:18.680 --> 1:03:29.080
 have a young man's lyrics in in an old johnny cash voice and heart and mind i had um are you

1:03:29.080 --> 1:03:35.640
 a fan of tom waits of course uh tom waits when he was younger had his this is a song called martha

1:03:36.360 --> 1:03:40.280
 but there's a bunch of songs he's written when he was young it's like how does a young man

1:03:41.240 --> 1:03:51.000
 have that like melancholy wisdom the song martha is about uh an older man calling a woman he used

1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:56.440
 to love that she's now married and he's married and they're having that conversation they haven't

1:03:56.440 --> 1:04:02.120
 spoken for 30 years and they realize that there's still love there and it could have been a different

1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:07.960
 life a different world where they could have been together and here's like a 23 year old tom waits

1:04:07.960 --> 1:04:14.760
 writing so beautifully about something that's very uh i've had a lot of people like tell me how

1:04:15.480 --> 1:04:22.280
 real that uh as an older person looking back at that love that you had and realizing it wasn't

1:04:22.280 --> 1:04:28.120
 it was really it's still there inklings of that love are still there i think there's a um

1:04:31.400 --> 1:04:35.560
 when a young person writes a sad song

1:04:38.760 --> 1:04:42.040
 they almost seem more willing to go to a more hopeless place

1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:50.040
 because they have they have a so much time ahead and older artists tend to want to look at the

1:04:50.040 --> 1:04:55.080
 bright side of things which which also i think comes from the wisdom of aging it's it's a more

1:04:55.080 --> 1:05:02.200
 realistic position so it's not uncommon for younger people to write i think even in the

1:05:02.200 --> 1:05:11.400
 beatles you'll see like they're very heavy lyrics um middle to late era beatles which is still you

1:05:11.400 --> 1:05:17.080
 know they're in their 20s you know early 20s i guess wow that's hard to think about so much

1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:24.040
 accomplished unbelievable and they they went through the full journey from fun to darkness

1:05:25.560 --> 1:05:31.880
 in the span of a few years uh you mentioned lyrics um so you've obviously produced

1:05:33.560 --> 1:05:38.200
 albums with incredible lyrics i think you've mentioned the interesting characteristics of

1:05:38.200 --> 1:05:48.280
 hip hop of rap is that you're writing poetry to rhythm versus writing poetry to melody so

1:05:48.280 --> 1:05:53.880
 that's like one way to think about it and i'm a fan i mean tom waits let it go i'm a fan of

1:05:53.880 --> 1:06:02.760
 poetry period is there something um about highlighting the poetry of it the power of

1:06:02.760 --> 1:06:10.600
 words as you did with with heart if uh like if i have to play it again it's one uh a tom waits song

1:06:11.720 --> 1:06:17.080
 that's like less than a minute long that i always go back to it's one i really love and

1:06:17.080 --> 1:06:35.080
 has just a few lines it's called i want you and all it is is him saying i want you

1:06:35.080 --> 1:06:47.640
 i want you this is a 22 year old Tom Waits

1:06:47.640 --> 1:06:50.600
 all i want is you

1:06:56.360 --> 1:06:57.960
 give you stars above

1:06:57.960 --> 1:07:02.680
 the sun on the brightest day

1:07:05.240 --> 1:07:06.760
 giving you all my love

1:07:09.480 --> 1:07:15.400
 if only you would see that i want you you you

1:07:15.400 --> 1:07:29.560
 you all i want is you you you and then he hums for 20 more seconds beautiful so so

1:07:29.560 --> 1:07:34.840
 simple man that young man like low and but for people who don't know tom waits you should

1:07:34.840 --> 1:07:39.000
 definitely listen to him and his voice sounds very different now and it's interesting to see

1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:47.400
 the evolution of a human voice the the artist over time because that's a young like boy like voice

1:07:48.040 --> 1:07:55.080
 hopeful less clever less witty more simple that simplicity is there and he's not i mean that

1:07:55.080 --> 1:08:05.240
 takes guts to be so simple i would say lyrically and uh musically is there um sort of laying that

1:08:05.240 --> 1:08:14.360
 out on the table is there ways to that you like to highlight the voice the lyrics or there's no one

1:08:15.800 --> 1:08:22.760
 rule so do you what is the thing that makes music special is it the rhythm the melody the

1:08:23.800 --> 1:08:29.480
 uh or is ultimately the lyrics are always there or the idea you just asked me five different

1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:39.880
 questions i don't care i'll just get that it's not about you you don't want the answers i'll listen

1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:49.480
 uh i look forward to your comments the internet okay uh you have the greatest producer of all

1:08:49.480 --> 1:08:56.280
 time in front of you and you can't shut the hell up that's right friends uh is but you do value

1:08:56.280 --> 1:09:02.680
 lyrics is there a way to celebrate lyrics i value lyrics if the lyrics are important i'm not a lyric

1:09:02.680 --> 1:09:09.880
 person i'm very much uh whatever the thing that makes the thing good is the thing that i'm drawn

1:09:09.880 --> 1:09:19.000
 to for me um for a long time lyrics meant very little i would say from me really yes yes from

1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:24.280
 the earliest days for your right to party beastie boys yeah it was it was fun i thought they were

1:09:24.280 --> 1:09:31.000
 good lyrics but it wasn't what was important i mean it was in a in a almost a novelty way

1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:39.880
 not in a serious way early in my career i was much more focused on the rhythm first the rhythm

1:09:41.560 --> 1:09:47.160
 and i would if the lyrics weren't good enough i would be aware of it but it wasn't the driving

1:09:47.160 --> 1:09:52.440
 force for me and eventually over time then melody became an important piece which it

1:09:52.440 --> 1:10:00.040
 wasn't in the beginning and then uh lyrics became more important over time but it's always been a

1:10:01.880 --> 1:10:08.440
 always changing what what draws me in and one of the things i found as it relates to lyrics that

1:10:08.440 --> 1:10:18.360
 that can give a lyric a different power has to do with rhythm where if there's no drum

1:10:18.360 --> 1:10:22.040
 um the lyrics tend to mean more

1:10:24.440 --> 1:10:27.400
 so earlier what you were saying about if it was just acapella

1:10:28.680 --> 1:10:32.440
 you felt you felt marvin gay in a different way hearing the acapella

1:10:32.440 --> 1:10:49.720
 can you comment on i mean in terms of one of the greatest albums ever why does it sound so raw

1:10:51.240 --> 1:10:56.760
 her voice she's just a great singer but this is that you're not doing anything else you're doing

1:10:56.760 --> 1:11:02.840
 the uh there's there's there's strumming and then there's just a single beat

1:11:05.960 --> 1:11:14.040
 and then it builds

1:11:14.040 --> 1:11:16.360
 starting in my heart

1:11:25.080 --> 1:11:29.320
 this gets simpler but it feels like it's a giant orchestra

1:11:29.320 --> 1:11:38.040
 we almost had it all the scars of your love they leave me breathless i can't help feeling

1:11:38.040 --> 1:11:50.520
 there's backing vocals

1:11:50.520 --> 1:11:54.360
 the anger i love it

1:11:54.360 --> 1:12:07.880
 i just there's something about uh such a powerful voice and the instruments not getting in the way

1:12:08.680 --> 1:12:16.040
 i mean the same with the with hurt and johnny cash it is there um why does it sound so

1:12:17.400 --> 1:12:23.560
 like raw it's the same as hurt there's a it feels like you're in the room with them it feels like

1:12:23.560 --> 1:12:30.680
 they're not even singing they're like uh they're literally freshly mad and angry i think those are

1:12:30.680 --> 1:12:35.400
 the things that make great singers sound like great singers it's not it's not anything that

1:12:35.400 --> 1:12:41.240
 that's happening in the studio i mean we're i would say the only thing that us in the studio

1:12:41.240 --> 1:12:49.800
 can do is kind of get out of the way and not not ruin it you know it's like that's that's

1:12:49.800 --> 1:12:58.040
 what comes through of these these people i should also before i forget there is a lot of song choices

1:12:58.040 --> 1:13:03.560
 on that cd i would love to see the full options on the cd that you sent to johnny cash that i love

1:13:03.560 --> 1:13:10.440
 so solitary man is one of my favorite choices made there uh is it is that a neil damon song

1:13:11.160 --> 1:13:16.760
 it's funny you talk about them as songs because i tend to i tend to listen more to albums than

1:13:16.760 --> 1:13:21.720
 songs so if you really you're that's what you're doing your head you're pulling up the album

1:13:21.720 --> 1:13:27.560
 essentially no i'm like i'm going to that song but i don't know i've never listened to that song

1:13:27.560 --> 1:13:31.080
 but i know that when that when that song comes up in the sequence of the album

1:13:31.080 --> 1:13:46.280
 um it has a really powerful effect in me let's see what it does if you just started

1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:59.480
 if you could read my so interesting wow

1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:12.600
 i could tell just like an old time movie about a ghost from a wishing well in a castle dark

1:14:13.960 --> 1:14:23.640
 or a fortress strong with chains around my feet you know that ghost is me

1:14:23.640 --> 1:14:34.280
 and i will never be set free as long as there's a ghost that you can see

1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:44.120
 that's beautiful such a beautiful choice beautiful melody such a beautiful melody

1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:54.600
 and haunting words sung so simply i i have to um i mean so uh i was born in the soviet union

1:14:56.120 --> 1:15:06.360
 when when you when you're growing up uh there's a few bands that kind of i mean they're probably

1:15:06.360 --> 1:15:14.600
 forbidden still but they seep in and you get like uh bootlegged and and they somehow take over the

1:15:14.600 --> 1:15:21.720
 culture of the young of the young folk such as myself so uh on the metal side it was metallica

1:15:21.720 --> 1:15:31.000
 and iron maiden and uh on the i don't know what you call them but beastie boys i remember hearing

1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:37.960
 uh fight for your right and it was just like for some reason that stuck as it did for a lot of

1:15:37.960 --> 1:15:44.680
 people in russia it's like wow america is when you get to say fuck you to the man the rebellion the

1:15:44.680 --> 1:15:51.720
 freedom um i probably heard it uh a few years after it was released because it kind of it

1:15:51.720 --> 1:15:56.200
 dissipates to the culture you get the bootlegged i mean it's hard to get your hands on but i just

1:15:56.200 --> 1:16:01.560
 remember me i i wanted to kind of bring that up because it was such a personally important song

1:16:02.120 --> 1:16:08.120
 to me and yet probably you didn't even think of that you probably thought of it as its role in

1:16:08.120 --> 1:16:15.880
 the culture here in the united states like in terms of musically but i was you know 20 21 years old

1:16:15.880 --> 1:16:20.040
 and we just well you were that kid too right we're just making fun songs for our friends there was

1:16:20.040 --> 1:16:26.680
 no there was no uh expectation that's just a fun song yeah no one thought we never imagined anybody

1:16:26.680 --> 1:16:37.560
 would like any of it one of the greatest albums ever yeah i have to it's i love this so much i

1:16:37.560 --> 1:16:51.240
 just remember this is america i didn't even know i didn't even understand the lyrics to be honest

1:16:51.240 --> 1:17:04.920
 and the lyrics are ridiculous

1:17:28.280 --> 1:17:34.120
 so hearing that and hearing metallica master puppets i was like i knew i'm gonna have to end

1:17:34.120 --> 1:17:42.440
 up in america one day i mean maybe now that i'm more mature or maybe a little bit more mature i

1:17:42.440 --> 1:17:49.720
 realized like that was kind of the longing for freedom it felt like at least at the time if this

1:17:49.720 --> 1:18:00.600
 is allowed that anything is allowed yeah and i think that uh the rebellion of it the uh is i

1:18:00.600 --> 1:18:05.800
 guess it's also fun i just i just loved it is there if you look back to that because you're

1:18:05.800 --> 1:18:13.240
 you're uh uh i mean you were that person not just the producer it feels like yes and no like it was

1:18:13.800 --> 1:18:19.560
 even to us then it was still like satirical you know it wasn't oh absolutely but isn't like music

1:18:19.560 --> 1:18:26.120
 in part like you're dancing in the line is part satirical part serious in in the sense like you're

1:18:26.120 --> 1:18:32.120
 losing yourself in the satire like when you have anytime you go over the top isn't that part of the

1:18:34.840 --> 1:18:39.640
 or is this is it explicitly satirical you make it fun i mean girls there's a lot of

1:18:39.640 --> 1:18:44.600
 ridiculous songs in that album i don't know i just think it's it was definitely to make each

1:18:44.600 --> 1:18:49.800
 other laugh like we were trying to make each other laugh we weren't trying to make a point we're

1:18:49.800 --> 1:18:57.080
 trying to make each other laugh but that person how's that person different than the person today

1:18:57.080 --> 1:19:01.960
 in you the the person that produced that i wouldn't say so different it's like it really is

1:19:01.960 --> 1:19:08.120
 that that um i like things that make me laugh you know i like ridiculous things it's the same person

1:19:08.120 --> 1:19:14.680
 still i think so that is a strange just how many incredible i mean i wouldn't i don't think i would

1:19:14.680 --> 1:19:22.840
 make that today but i understand why we made it when we did it's uh in the vocabulary of of um

1:19:22.840 --> 1:19:28.520
 ridiculous that would make sense to do you know for the right artist today could make something

1:19:28.520 --> 1:19:35.640
 ridiculous and gives you that feeling i mean there's just a sense when you make so many

1:19:35.640 --> 1:19:43.720
 many different albums then you look back at that creation and it can feel like a different person

1:19:43.720 --> 1:19:50.120
 created that but you're making it seem like if you travel back in time or maybe do a memory replay

1:19:50.840 --> 1:19:58.600
 you'll be able to hang out with the with a teenage and the 20s recruitment i think yeah i i don't

1:19:58.600 --> 1:20:06.360
 i don't think i was so different honestly that's hilarious it's funny i ran into someone um recently

1:20:08.200 --> 1:20:13.880
 in costa rica who i hadn't seen in a long time and who i knew from the new york days when

1:20:15.080 --> 1:20:21.160
 those days and um and we spent a couple of hours talking and she said you're exactly

1:20:21.160 --> 1:20:29.480
 the same person that you were then so i have a short you know a recent confirmation that that's

1:20:29.480 --> 1:20:34.440
 the case that's beautiful was it tim ferris asked you about like who's the most successful person

1:20:34.440 --> 1:20:40.200
 you know that's the definition of success i would say it's exactly the same person you haven't lost

1:20:40.200 --> 1:20:46.120
 yourself and or rather you found yourself early on i would say there there are aspects of me that

1:20:46.120 --> 1:20:54.680
 have changed for sure um but i but i can't say that it's that it's necessarily better it's

1:20:54.680 --> 1:21:04.120
 different um at that i would say at that time i was more confident than i am now and i'm very

1:21:04.120 --> 1:21:11.480
 confident now but then i had an unrealistic um confidence and i think now it's a little more

1:21:11.480 --> 1:21:18.120
 um based in reality at that point in time i had never been depressed and then once you go through

1:21:18.120 --> 1:21:25.240
 a depression you well some people i know in my case and when i went through depression afterwards

1:21:25.240 --> 1:21:33.800
 i was a different person than i was before and i and i feel more um grounded now than i did then

1:21:33.800 --> 1:21:40.920
 and i probably relate to the artists who so many of the artists i work with suffer so many artists

1:21:40.920 --> 1:21:45.960
 suffer because that's part of what makes an artist great is their level of sensitivity

1:21:47.080 --> 1:21:53.160
 that this the same thing that makes uh an artist uncomfortable other people don't feel at all

1:21:53.160 --> 1:22:02.600
 people don't feel at all the time you were depressed what was the darkest moments of your

1:22:02.600 --> 1:22:10.600
 life what took you there how did you get out it was triggered by a person making a comment about

1:22:10.600 --> 1:22:17.240
 something to do with work that didn't matter you know it was like uh to anyone else they would

1:22:17.240 --> 1:22:21.320
 hear that and it would just be like okay we'll deal with it next week whatever but for some

1:22:21.320 --> 1:22:28.920
 reason i took it in a way that um i felt like the rug had been pulled out from under me even beyond

1:22:28.920 --> 1:22:36.120
 the rational part of it of understanding you know even after the problem that came up was solved

1:22:36.120 --> 1:22:42.760
 it somehow undermined something in me and made me feel very vulnerable in a way that i hadn't felt

1:22:42.760 --> 1:22:51.720
 before and it spiraled how did you get out i did a lot of different kinds of therapy i did um

1:22:52.840 --> 1:23:00.280
 starting with alternative therapies i was seeing i would say between seven and eight

1:23:00.280 --> 1:23:16.040
 doctors and or therapists a week um acupuncture uh talk therapy um herbs or any any possible

1:23:16.040 --> 1:23:26.920
 modality tried everything for a long time and um and and nothing seemed to have an impact and then

1:23:26.920 --> 1:23:39.080
 finally um i'm wary of taking any western medicine i'm not a drug taker and or drinker

1:23:39.880 --> 1:23:49.240
 partier in any way and um i found a a psychopharmacologist who was a psychic

1:23:50.280 --> 1:23:55.160
 but because she was a psychic i was okay to see her because she's like i'll i'll do i'll listen

1:23:55.160 --> 1:24:00.920
 to a psychic yeah but i'm not going to listen to a psychopharmacologist but the fact that she had

1:24:00.920 --> 1:24:10.040
 the the psychic uh that made her fit into my world view and um and she recommended antidepressant which

1:24:10.680 --> 1:24:15.560
 went terribly wrong in the first night that i took it and then i that set me on a journey

1:24:15.560 --> 1:24:21.080
 of looking for the right antidepressant which was a long and painful process heck of a journey

1:24:21.080 --> 1:24:27.560
 every one that i took made me sick everyone and then finally i don't know five months later six

1:24:27.560 --> 1:24:36.920
 months later i found the magic one that worked for me and it um it shifted me out of the depression

1:24:36.920 --> 1:24:43.960
 i took it for my camera was six months or a year and then weaned off and was okay and then i had

1:24:43.960 --> 1:24:50.760
 another event some years later i think i took it again for a short period of time and got out of it

1:24:50.760 --> 1:24:57.160
 and i've not needed it since were you able to kind of introspect the triggers that led to the events

1:24:58.360 --> 1:25:04.200
 is there something or is it random events of life i think it's more that um

1:25:05.480 --> 1:25:12.280
 because of the way that i grew up i never had to deal with much controversy

1:25:12.280 --> 1:25:21.720
 ah and um when i when i was challenged i didn't have any ability to deal with it

1:25:21.720 --> 1:25:27.960
 it's like um you know jonathan hight talks about it's like that so you've actually also mentioned

1:25:27.960 --> 1:25:33.960
 like business sometimes gives you stress so these this was business related stuff yeah

1:25:33.960 --> 1:25:39.560
 it was a business related thing it just made me feel bad it's one of the sadder things about art

1:25:39.560 --> 1:25:47.160
 and music is that it's often interleaved with business folk i suppose that's the way of the

1:25:47.160 --> 1:25:55.960
 world if you have a capitalist system but it makes that business folks rubbing up against artists

1:25:55.960 --> 1:26:06.360
 um can sometimes destroy a fragile mind and soul like uh to me like one of the best representations

1:26:06.360 --> 1:26:12.040
 of an artist honestly johnny i have the designer from apple and he's just so fragile with his

1:26:12.040 --> 1:26:17.480
 ideas and you talked about like when he has ideas he really wouldn't show it to steve jobs or anybody

1:26:17.480 --> 1:26:22.760
 except for a small design team because he was so nervous that it would it would break let's give

1:26:22.760 --> 1:26:30.120
 it a chance let it give it a chance to grow and it seems like the outside world uh business people

1:26:30.120 --> 1:26:37.480
 pr people people kind of um have not lost themselves in the passion of creating but instead

1:26:37.480 --> 1:26:43.400
 of kind of representing or like making deals all that kind of stuff they they can kind of trample

1:26:43.400 --> 1:26:49.880
 on those little ideas and it's it's sad to see yeah it's really it's really heartbreaking to

1:26:49.880 --> 1:26:55.240
 see because you know how much trampling there's going on it's one of the main jobs my jobs as a

1:26:55.240 --> 1:27:04.600
 record producer is to um keep the keep the voices away from the artist from all the people who are

1:27:04.600 --> 1:27:11.160
 really on their side but don't know you know like the uh whether it be people um anyone on the

1:27:11.160 --> 1:27:17.880
 business side who doesn't make things they're excited to do their part you know they're excited

1:27:17.880 --> 1:27:25.160
 if when you deliver the thing the the art that you make to me then we can start the project yeah um

1:27:25.160 --> 1:27:31.400
 but there's nothing to sell if the art doesn't happen in the right way and it has to be protected

1:27:31.400 --> 1:27:39.400
 and it can't happen on the same kind of a timetable that um that business can it's just a

1:27:39.400 --> 1:27:45.640
 different thing it doesn't art doesn't come in a quarterly way and that doesn't apply just to music

1:27:45.640 --> 1:27:51.560
 or it applies to art it applies to all creative pursuits like this is generally the case like at

1:27:51.560 --> 1:28:00.520
 mit it's just there's the administration and then there is the professors and students and the

1:28:00.520 --> 1:28:06.280
 professors students are the creative folk yeah they create stuff they dream they have wild ideas

1:28:06.280 --> 1:28:11.320
 that go on tangents and so on they they uh they have hopes and they they go with those and they

1:28:11.320 --> 1:28:16.760
 get like on these weird passionate pursuits and then the administration can often just trample on

1:28:16.760 --> 1:28:25.000
 that um and they they set up bars on all kinds of in all kinds of ways that you think you're not

1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:34.120
 actually hurting um but you really are and you know i won't mention why but because this happens

1:28:34.120 --> 1:28:39.800
 to everybody and i have a large amount of leverage at mit now but even i get a little bit of pressure

1:28:39.800 --> 1:28:48.920
 in such stupid ways to like don't like be careful be careful like we really want your career to

1:28:48.920 --> 1:28:55.160
 succeed be careful and that little pressure to an artist you know do you want to go acapella

1:28:55.160 --> 1:29:00.280
 do you want to go do you want to do a country record like be careful like you're already a

1:29:00.280 --> 1:29:06.920
 superstar be careful yeah and then in that way you kind of push people like flock of fish into

1:29:06.920 --> 1:29:13.080
 one fish tank where they're all the same and it's it's sad to see and it's obviously in the modern

1:29:13.080 --> 1:29:18.680
 world there's nice mechanism to protect to let artists flourish a little bit more because they

1:29:18.680 --> 1:29:23.080
 get to put themselves to the world and get a little bit more confidence maybe different funding

1:29:23.080 --> 1:29:29.320
 mechanisms all that kind of stuff but tremendous problem that the the voices that don't understand

1:29:29.320 --> 1:29:35.560
 interfering with the process is huge the other side of it is in success there can be a lack of

1:29:35.560 --> 1:29:41.000
 there can be a lack of reality where all of the people around the successful person just tell

1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:47.000
 them everything they do is great and then they they don't have anything to bump up against anymore

1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:57.240
 have a realistic uh sense of what's what how things work or how how it how the how things measure you

1:29:57.240 --> 1:30:06.200
 know um so both sides are really important both both avoiding the voices getting in the way

1:30:06.920 --> 1:30:15.080
 and having a trusted group of you know a sangha a group of people who can say you know i don't

1:30:15.080 --> 1:30:20.040
 know if that's as good and you can still you know say i don't care what you think that's fine

1:30:20.040 --> 1:30:29.400
 but it helps to hear it you know it helps to have if someone who you respect tells you something

1:30:29.400 --> 1:30:34.280
 isn't good enough it's helpful when you know it comes from a place of love when it comes from a

1:30:34.280 --> 1:30:40.200
 place of wisdom 100 percent and not from a place of fear not from a place of oh this doesn't sound

1:30:40.200 --> 1:30:46.520
 like it's going to do as well as your last thing that's yeah that's not the point the point is on

1:30:46.520 --> 1:30:55.960
 this uh quest for greatness are you living up to your ability by the way is there something

1:30:55.960 --> 1:31:02.120
 interesting to say about your world view because you mentioned psychic and instead of the ways

1:31:02.120 --> 1:31:11.160
 we can be healthy the ways we can grow and how much maybe medicine or science or has

1:31:11.160 --> 1:31:17.960
 um has the answers is there is there some interesting way to describe that world view

1:31:17.960 --> 1:31:21.240
 i would just say i'm open mind i believe anything's possible

1:31:22.520 --> 1:31:28.040
 and if i was going to trust in any practical information it would be something thousands

1:31:28.040 --> 1:31:37.320
 of years old there's wisdom in that history yeah well it's it's more tested it's not always right

1:31:37.320 --> 1:31:44.760
 but it's at least it's been somewhat tested so science is also tested the thing i'm a little

1:31:44.760 --> 1:31:49.560
 bit skeptical of sometimes is just the hubris that often comes with the modern with the latest

1:31:49.560 --> 1:31:55.080
 the newest the this this feeling like you figured it all out everything that's been done in the past

1:31:55.080 --> 1:32:01.160
 has no wisdom and uh we basically solved every problem uh you know there's nothing else to be

1:32:01.160 --> 1:32:05.160
 solved this i mean that's the defining characteristic of any age is like we've

1:32:05.160 --> 1:32:10.280
 solved all the problems there are we have the final answers and our parents are all stupid

1:32:11.560 --> 1:32:15.480
 that kind of energy yeah and that you have to be extremely extremely careful with that when it

1:32:15.480 --> 1:32:19.800
 talks about when you think about something as complex as the human body or the human mind

1:32:19.800 --> 1:32:27.560
 you have to be very very very we know close to nothing yeah exactly close to nothing that's about

1:32:27.560 --> 1:32:33.000
 anything about anything about anything that place of humility is a good place to start to figure

1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:38.200
 to figure it all out and in the end we'll still know almost nothing yeah i don't think we need to

1:32:38.200 --> 1:32:44.280
 know it's like we need to see what works and we need to see what works for us it's interesting to

1:32:44.280 --> 1:32:52.360
 know i i know on the art side knowing how it works isn't what makes it work you know isn't the magic

1:32:52.360 --> 1:33:00.040
 of it isn't how it works the magic is the magic and the magic happens in a way that's intuitive

1:33:00.040 --> 1:33:06.440
 and accidental at times or uh incidental where you're trying many things all of a sudden something

1:33:06.440 --> 1:33:13.160
 works and um and you don't know why and it's okay not to know why it doesn't matter it doesn't

1:33:13.160 --> 1:33:19.560
 really matter why as long as it does the thing that you want it to do whatever that is yeah

1:33:19.560 --> 1:33:25.240
 that's so weird when you know the components you don't you still yeah the magic what's the magic

1:33:25.240 --> 1:33:29.880
 where's the magic like we know the components for stuff i care about artificial intelligence we know

1:33:29.880 --> 1:33:38.200
 the components of a powerful computing machinery where does consciousness come from what is that

1:33:39.320 --> 1:33:47.960
 uh where does the uh brilliant moments of insight come from what's that when uh even in simple games

1:33:47.960 --> 1:33:54.680
 of chess or in simple where do those breakthrough ideas of taking the big risk that doesn't make any

1:33:54.680 --> 1:33:58.840
 sense and then all of a sudden it becomes something beautiful yeah we don't need to understand why it

1:33:58.840 --> 1:34:05.320
 just happens it just happens and often the things that end up breaking through don't break through

1:34:05.320 --> 1:34:10.680
 in the way we thought or turn out to be a third iteration of something that we thought was an

1:34:10.680 --> 1:34:17.800
 entirely different thing or we don't know you know it's and i i think it's if we embrace that not

1:34:17.800 --> 1:34:24.440
 knowing we'll have a healthier experience going through life you made a lot it's not just music

1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:30.600
 everything rearranging the chairs the furniture as well you've done like i said the documentary

1:34:30.600 --> 1:34:38.920
 i guess you would say with paul mccartney and um you've done a podcast yourself uh broken

1:34:38.920 --> 1:34:45.080
 record podcast and just you've done conversation too so what have you learned from that process

1:34:45.080 --> 1:34:54.120
 about the art of conversation and also maybe what advice would you give to this uh to me about how

1:34:54.680 --> 1:34:59.080
 what to do with conversation like what is interesting to you about conversation one of the

1:34:59.080 --> 1:35:09.080
 things that i i like is to not feel like it's there is any stakes or that it's actually almost

1:35:09.080 --> 1:35:16.200
 that it's not happening like the fact that when i came in you were setting up cameras made it less

1:35:16.200 --> 1:35:21.160
 good from for me i knew that that would impact the conversation in a negative way the best version

1:35:21.160 --> 1:35:27.320
 of it would be if we didn't see the cameras and if we were and we didn't see any technology

1:35:27.320 --> 1:35:31.880
 and we didn't see any technology and we were just sitting at this table having a conversation

1:35:31.880 --> 1:35:38.040
 maybe even if we were miked beforehand would be okay if it was necessary but then we were just

1:35:38.040 --> 1:35:41.960
 sitting here having a conversation no people in the room nothing and feeling like we're just

1:35:41.960 --> 1:35:53.800
 having a conversation i feel like it would get closer to um closer to the relaxed feeling same

1:35:53.800 --> 1:35:58.120
 thing we do in the studios like you know you've heard of red light fever you know when uh artists

1:35:58.120 --> 1:36:02.280
 get nervous when like they play a song great and then the tape starts rolling and they can't play

1:36:02.280 --> 1:36:08.280
 it and it's we're all we're all to some degree like that when you were with paul mccartney i mean

1:36:08.280 --> 1:36:16.200
 you're did were you cognizant of cameras we had the room black everybody who was working there

1:36:16.200 --> 1:36:22.680
 was dressed in black everything was invisible that we were lit in a way where even though

1:36:22.680 --> 1:36:31.000
 there were probably 20 people between 12 and 20 people working in the room within three minutes

1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:36.360
 of starting the conversation paul and i were alone in the room so it that was the the feeling

1:36:36.360 --> 1:36:41.080
 on occasion you'd hear a noise and it would be weird people we also had nobody was allowed to

1:36:41.080 --> 1:36:48.360
 wear shoes because it had to we were trying to create this intimate space and and i know from

1:36:48.360 --> 1:36:56.760
 in the recording studio when we're recording if even one person is there that's just watching

1:36:56.760 --> 1:37:01.960
 and not working you know like does like there's usually i'm usually there and an engineer is there

1:37:01.960 --> 1:37:07.480
 technically making it happen if anyone else is in the room it's different because then it goes from

1:37:08.520 --> 1:37:13.560
 this moment where the person's doing a performance to the sense or where the person is

1:37:13.560 --> 1:37:23.240
 is feeling something internally and we're capturing it to the the other version is

1:37:23.240 --> 1:37:29.080
 they're performing for someone it's so interesting so like to push back in the alternatives here so

1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:36.360
 one about the third person not to make people self conscious but i find that i'm so torn on that

1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:42.360
 because sometimes when that person uh like um so evan is in the room here he's been in the

1:37:42.360 --> 1:37:51.800
 room before he's a huge fan of yours by the way uh so he'll he'll nod yeah he'll get excited he's

1:37:51.800 --> 1:37:57.480
 like and you can see that nodding and for some reason for me he's like yeah yeah you get it like

1:37:58.120 --> 1:38:04.120
 yeah you get excited together i mean that's that third person can be like a really special so

1:38:04.120 --> 1:38:10.760
 having an audience uh when it's a friend or somebody that has that love in them it depends

1:38:10.760 --> 1:38:17.720
 on the performer right yeah some people really thrive in front of an audience and you're saying

1:38:17.720 --> 1:38:23.400
 you like that simple intimacy well i like the reality of it not being i want it to be as far

1:38:23.400 --> 1:38:30.600
 from a performance as possible got it and if if someone i'll tell you a story a story that just

1:38:30.600 --> 1:38:36.280
 happened and it was viewed as kind of a it seemed uncool in the moment to the person that it happened

1:38:36.280 --> 1:38:43.560
 to it wasn't at all um we were recording the new chili peppers album which is coming out i think

1:38:43.560 --> 1:38:48.280
 any day now like uh i don't know what today's date is but within the next it maybe by the

1:38:48.280 --> 1:38:56.200
 time this airs it will be out and um the band was playing in the studio and it was ripping

1:38:56.200 --> 1:39:04.120
 because they play they're incredible and um one of the members walked through the control room

1:39:04.120 --> 1:39:12.280
 after a particularly great performance and um the engineer said wow that solo is really great

1:39:13.640 --> 1:39:21.240
 and the person who heard this said please don't say that and walked away it's like it it was

1:39:21.240 --> 1:39:28.120
 not it it just changed yeah this feeling of we're in this place where we're doing this thing and

1:39:28.120 --> 1:39:33.880
 there's there is no outside world yeah you know we're doing this for us we're going as deep as

1:39:33.880 --> 1:39:38.760
 we can for us and as soon as there's an acknowledgement to someone else in a way

1:39:39.400 --> 1:39:48.680
 it breaks the concentration of being inside of it that's so well told and but it's something

1:39:48.680 --> 1:39:54.440
 about saying wow that's always great is is uh shows the it reminds you that there's an outside

1:39:54.440 --> 1:40:01.800
 world but i feel like there's a way to enter the inside world as an audience so you just have to

1:40:01.800 --> 1:40:10.600
 do that so it matters what you say it matters how you look it matters uh so there's like these

1:40:10.600 --> 1:40:17.800
 generic compliments not generic but they they sound in the way an outside world would interact

1:40:17.800 --> 1:40:22.760
 as opposed to in that creative thing where you're dancing around the fire together or something

1:40:22.760 --> 1:40:26.280
 it was actually i can tell you there's another interesting one that happened to me and i didn't

1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:32.680
 know this until i saw the film of it which was a strange one um we were recording with the avid

1:40:32.680 --> 1:40:40.120
 brothers and um the song was called no hard feelings and it was this recording of no hard

1:40:40.120 --> 1:40:57.800
 feelings

1:41:02.360 --> 1:41:05.800
 when my body won't hold me anymore

1:41:05.800 --> 1:41:14.200
 it finally lets me free well i'll be ready

1:41:17.480 --> 1:41:23.160
 when my feet won't walk another such a great voice so beautiful

1:41:23.160 --> 1:41:35.400
 kissed goodbye will my hands be steady when i lay down my fears my hopes and my doubts

1:41:36.440 --> 1:41:47.080
 the rings on my fingers and the keys to my house with no hard feelings

1:41:47.080 --> 1:42:00.920
 when the sun hangs low in the west and the light in my chest won't be kept

1:42:02.520 --> 1:42:04.680
 hell today any longer

1:42:04.680 --> 1:42:14.120
 when the jealousy fades away so bright so hopeful so lighthearted

1:42:17.720 --> 1:42:25.640
 and it's just hallelujah and love involved love in the words

1:42:25.640 --> 1:42:39.480
 love in the songs they sing in the church and no hard feelings

1:42:39.480 --> 1:42:45.480
 Lord knows they have it done

1:42:45.480 --> 1:42:57.320
 much good for anyone kept me afraid and cold

1:42:57.320 --> 1:43:03.320
 with so much to have and more

1:43:03.320 --> 1:43:21.160
 when my body won't hold me anymore it finally lets me free

1:43:21.160 --> 1:43:37.160
 is he sound as good as good, yeah? yes, every bit

1:43:37.160 --> 1:43:55.160
 of snow from the heavens will i join with the ocean blue or run into the savior true

1:43:55.160 --> 1:44:05.160
 and shake hands laughing and walk through the night straight to the light

1:44:05.160 --> 1:44:17.160
 holding the love i've known in my life and no hard feelings

1:44:17.160 --> 1:44:37.160
 Lord knows they have it done much good for anyone kept me afraid and cold

1:44:37.160 --> 1:44:43.160
 with so much to have and more

1:44:43.160 --> 1:44:57.160
