00:00.000 --> 00:03.880
 Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster.

00:03.880 --> 00:05.560
 And if you gaze into the abyss,

00:05.560 --> 00:08.960
 the abyss gazes also into you.

00:08.960 --> 00:12.200
 But I would say, bring it on.

00:13.060 --> 00:15.280
 If you gaze into the abyss long enough,

00:15.280 --> 00:17.240
 you see the light, not the darkness.

00:18.320 --> 00:20.220
 Are you sure about that?

00:20.220 --> 00:21.680
 I'm betting my life on it.

00:24.320 --> 00:27.240
 The following is a conversation with Jordan Peterson,

00:27.240 --> 00:30.840
 an influential psychologist, lecturer, podcast host,

00:30.840 --> 00:34.840
 and author of Maps of Meaning, 12 Rules for Life,

00:34.840 --> 00:37.740
 and Beyond Order.

00:37.740 --> 00:39.660
 This is the Lex Readman podcast.

00:39.660 --> 00:41.680
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:41.680 --> 00:43.000
 in the description.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.940
 And now, dear friends, here's Jordan Peterson.

00:48.040 --> 00:50.440
 Dostoevsky wrote in The Idiot,

00:50.440 --> 00:52.920
 spoken through the character of Prince Mishkin,

00:52.920 --> 00:55.120
 that beauty will save the world.

00:55.120 --> 00:58.840
 Solzhenitsyn actually mentioned this in his Nobel Prize

00:58.840 --> 01:00.220
 acceptance speech.

01:00.220 --> 01:02.480
 What do you think Dostoevsky meant by that?

01:02.480 --> 01:04.120
 Was he right?

01:04.120 --> 01:09.120
 Well, I guess it's the divine that saves the world,

01:10.080 --> 01:13.160
 let's say, you could say that by definition.

01:13.160 --> 01:16.400
 And then you might say, well, are there pointers

01:16.400 --> 01:18.300
 to that which will save the world,

01:18.300 --> 01:20.140
 or that which eternally saves the world?

01:20.140 --> 01:23.360
 And the answer to that, in all likelihood, is yes.

01:23.360 --> 01:27.600
 And that's maybe truth, and love, and justice,

01:27.600 --> 01:31.920
 and the classical virtues, beauty, perhaps,

01:31.920 --> 01:34.640
 in some sense, foremost among them.

01:34.640 --> 01:37.620
 That's a difficult case to make, but definitely a pointer.

01:37.620 --> 01:39.480
 Which direction is the arrow pointing?

01:39.480 --> 01:40.640
 Well, the arrow's pointing up.

01:40.640 --> 01:43.240
 No, I think that that which it points to

01:43.240 --> 01:45.000
 is what beauty points to.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.360
 It transcends beauty.

01:46.360 --> 01:47.480
 It's more than beauty.

01:47.480 --> 01:49.400
 And that speaks to the divine.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.240
 It points to the divine.

01:51.240 --> 01:53.240
 Yeah, and I would say, again, by definition,

01:53.240 --> 01:56.480
 because we could define the divine in some real sense.

01:56.480 --> 01:59.360
 So one way of defining the divine is,

01:59.360 --> 02:03.480
 what is divine to you is your most fundamental axiom.

02:03.480 --> 02:06.040
 And you might say, well, I don't have a fundamental axiom.

02:06.040 --> 02:07.280
 And I would say, that's fine,

02:07.280 --> 02:09.620
 but then you're just confused,

02:09.620 --> 02:11.960
 because you have a bunch of contradictory axioms.

02:11.960 --> 02:14.040
 And you might say, well, I have no axioms at all.

02:14.040 --> 02:16.240
 And then I'd say, well, you're just epistemologically

02:16.240 --> 02:19.020
 ignorant beyond comprehension, if you think that,

02:19.020 --> 02:20.640
 because that's just not true at all.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.400
 So you don't think a human being can exist

02:22.400 --> 02:24.160
 within contradictions?

02:24.160 --> 02:26.280
 Well, yeah, we have to exist within contradiction.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.840
 But when the contradictions make themselves manifest,

02:29.840 --> 02:33.020
 say in confusion with regard to direction,

02:33.020 --> 02:37.760
 then the consequence of that technically is anxiety,

02:37.760 --> 02:39.340
 and frustration, and disappointment,

02:39.340 --> 02:41.040
 and all sorts of other negative emotions.

02:41.040 --> 02:43.920
 But the cardinal negative emotion,

02:43.920 --> 02:48.840
 signifying multiple pathways forward, is anxiety.

02:48.840 --> 02:51.080
 It's an entropy signal.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.920
 But you don't think that kind of entropy signal

02:53.920 --> 02:58.520
 can be channeled into beauty, into love?

02:58.520 --> 03:03.520
 Why does beauty and love have to be clear, ordered, simple?

03:04.480 --> 03:08.720
 Well, I would say it probably doesn't have to be,

03:09.560 --> 03:12.540
 it can't be reduced to clarity and simplicity.

03:13.640 --> 03:15.880
 Because when it's optimally structured,

03:15.880 --> 03:20.880
 it's a balance between order and chaos, not order itself.

03:20.880 --> 03:23.280
 If it's too ordered, if music is too ordered,

03:23.280 --> 03:25.180
 it's not acceptable.

03:25.180 --> 03:27.740
 It sounds like a drum machine, it's too repetitive,

03:27.740 --> 03:29.540
 it's too predictable.

03:29.540 --> 03:34.360
 It has to have, well, it has to have some fire in it,

03:34.360 --> 03:36.020
 along with the structure.

03:36.020 --> 03:40.740
 I was in Miami doing a seminar on Exodus

03:40.740 --> 03:45.740
 with a number of scholars, and this is a beauty discussion.

03:45.880 --> 03:48.380
 When Moses first encounters the burning bush,

03:48.380 --> 03:52.420
 it's not a conflagration that demands attention,

03:52.420 --> 03:54.460
 it's something that catches his attention.

03:55.580 --> 03:57.980
 It's a phenomena, and that means to shine forth.

03:57.980 --> 04:01.260
 And Moses has to stop and attend to it, and he does.

04:01.260 --> 04:05.540
 And he sees this fire that doesn't consume the tree.

04:05.540 --> 04:07.740
 And the tree, the tree is a structure, right?

04:07.740 --> 04:10.100
 It's a tree like structure, it's a branching structure,

04:10.100 --> 04:12.040
 it's a hierarchical structure.

04:12.040 --> 04:15.980
 It's a self similar structure, it's a fractal structure.

04:15.980 --> 04:17.140
 And it's the tree of life,

04:17.140 --> 04:19.020
 and it's the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

04:19.020 --> 04:23.060
 And the fire in it is the transformation

04:23.060 --> 04:25.380
 that's always occurring within every structure.

04:25.380 --> 04:28.560
 And the fact that the fire doesn't consume the bush

04:28.560 --> 04:32.380
 in that representation is an indication

04:32.380 --> 04:34.820
 of the balance of transformation with structure.

04:34.820 --> 04:37.940
 And that balance is presented as God,

04:37.940 --> 04:42.320
 and what attracts Moses to it in some sense is the beauty.

04:42.320 --> 04:43.820
 Now it's the novelty and all that,

04:43.820 --> 04:46.480
 but like a painting is like a burning bush,

04:46.480 --> 04:48.780
 that's a good way of thinking about it, a great painting.

04:48.780 --> 04:51.280
 It's too much for people often.

04:51.280 --> 04:55.080
 My house was, and will soon be again,

04:55.080 --> 04:58.180
 completely covered with paintings inside.

04:58.180 --> 05:01.780
 And it was hard on people to come in there

05:01.780 --> 05:04.580
 because, well, my mother, for example, say,

05:04.580 --> 05:07.060
 well, why would you wanna live in a museum?

05:07.060 --> 05:09.180
 And I'd think, well, I would rather live in a museum

05:09.180 --> 05:10.860
 than anywhere else in some real sense,

05:10.860 --> 05:15.060
 but beauty is daunting, it scares people.

05:15.060 --> 05:17.180
 They're terrified of buying art, for example,

05:17.180 --> 05:18.700
 because their taste is on display,

05:18.700 --> 05:19.740
 and they should be terrified

05:19.740 --> 05:22.300
 because generally people have terrible taste.

05:22.300 --> 05:24.500
 Now, that doesn't mean they shouldn't foster it

05:24.500 --> 05:26.380
 and develop it, but, and you know,

05:26.380 --> 05:28.400
 when you put your taste on display,

05:28.400 --> 05:30.700
 it really exposes you.

05:30.700 --> 05:34.580
 Even to yourself as you walk past it every day.

05:34.580 --> 05:36.020
 Absolutely. This is who I am.

05:36.020 --> 05:38.340
 Yeah, well, and look how mundane that is,

05:38.340 --> 05:41.340
 and look how trite it is, and look at how cliched it is,

05:41.340 --> 05:45.100
 and look at how sterile or too ordered it is, or too chaotic.

05:45.100 --> 05:47.140
 Or how quickly you start to take it for granted

05:47.140 --> 05:48.580
 because you've seen it so many times.

05:48.580 --> 05:51.540
 Well, if it's a real piece of art, that doesn't happen.

05:51.540 --> 05:53.340
 You notice the little details.

05:53.340 --> 05:55.700
 The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.

05:55.700 --> 05:59.620
 I mean, there are images, religious images in particular,

05:59.620 --> 06:02.080
 so we could call them deep images,

06:02.080 --> 06:07.020
 that people have been unpacking for 4,000 years

06:07.020 --> 06:09.180
 and still haven't, I'll give you an example.

06:09.180 --> 06:12.540
 This is a terrible example.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.820
 So, I did a lecture series on Genesis,

06:15.820 --> 06:21.380
 and I got a lot of it unpacked, but by no means all of it.

06:21.380 --> 06:25.140
 When God kicks Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden,

06:25.140 --> 06:28.380
 he puts cherubim with flaming swords at the gate

06:28.380 --> 06:31.860
 to stop human beings from reentering paradise.

06:31.860 --> 06:34.100
 I thought, what the hell does that mean, cherubim,

06:34.100 --> 06:35.740
 and why do they have flaming swords?

06:35.740 --> 06:38.740
 I don't get that. What is that exactly?

06:38.740 --> 06:41.260
 And then I found out from Matthew Pagel,

06:41.260 --> 06:44.180
 who wrote a great book on symbolism in Genesis,

06:44.180 --> 06:48.060
 that cherubim are the supporting monsters of God.

06:48.060 --> 06:50.100
 It's a very complicated idea,

06:50.100 --> 06:53.660
 and that they are partly a representation of that

06:53.660 --> 06:57.100
 which is difficult to fit into conceptual systems.

06:57.100 --> 07:00.940
 They've also got an angelic or demonic aspect.

07:00.940 --> 07:02.260
 Take your pick.

07:02.260 --> 07:04.260
 Why do they have flaming swords?

07:04.260 --> 07:11.900
 Well, a sword is a symbol of judgment and the separation

07:11.900 --> 07:13.260
 of the wheat from the chaff.

07:13.260 --> 07:18.500
 You use a sword to cut away, to cut away, and to carve.

07:18.500 --> 07:21.100
 And a flaming sword is not only that which carves,

07:21.100 --> 07:23.300
 it's that which burns.

07:23.300 --> 07:25.700
 And what does it carve away and burn?

07:25.700 --> 07:28.380
 Well, you want to get into paradise?

07:28.380 --> 07:32.500
 It carves away everything about you that isn't perfect.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.020
 And so what does that mean?

07:34.020 --> 07:35.660
 Okay, well, here's part of what it means.

07:35.660 --> 07:37.700
 This is a terrible thing.

07:37.700 --> 07:41.020
 So you could say that the entire Christian narrative

07:41.020 --> 07:43.820
 is embedded in that image.

07:43.820 --> 07:45.020
 Why?

07:45.020 --> 07:48.580
 Well, let's say that flaming swords are a symbol of death.

07:48.580 --> 07:50.780
 That seems pretty obvious.

07:50.780 --> 07:56.900
 Let's say further that they're a symbol of apocalypse and hell.

07:56.900 --> 07:59.540
 That doesn't seem completely unreasonable.

07:59.540 --> 08:02.260
 So here's an idea.

08:02.260 --> 08:04.820
 Not only do you have to face death,

08:04.820 --> 08:09.180
 you have to face death and hell before you can get to paradise.

08:09.180 --> 08:13.540
 Hellish judgment and all that's embedded in that image.

08:13.540 --> 08:16.580
 And a piece of art with an image like that

08:16.580 --> 08:18.820
 has all that information in it.

08:18.820 --> 08:22.660
 And it shines forth in some fundamental sense.

08:22.660 --> 08:25.620
 It reaches into the back tendrils of your mind

08:25.620 --> 08:29.540
 at levels you can't even comprehend and grips you.

08:29.540 --> 08:32.900
 I mean, that's why people go to museums and gaze at paintings

08:32.900 --> 08:33.860
 they don't understand.

08:33.860 --> 08:36.820
 And that's why they'll pay what's the most expensive objects

08:36.820 --> 08:37.700
 in the world.

08:37.700 --> 08:39.740
 If it's not carbon fiber racing yachts,

08:39.740 --> 08:42.900
 it's definitely classic paintings.

08:42.900 --> 08:47.100
 It's high level technological implements or it's classic art.

08:47.100 --> 08:48.940
 Well, why are those things so expensive?

08:48.940 --> 08:51.900
 Why do we build temples to house the images?

08:51.900 --> 08:54.660
 Even secular people go to museums.

08:54.660 --> 08:55.820
 I'm secular.

08:55.820 --> 08:56.980
 Well, are you in a museum?

08:56.980 --> 08:57.620
 Yes.

08:57.620 --> 08:58.620
 Are you looking at art?

08:58.620 --> 08:59.460
 Yes.

08:59.460 --> 09:03.780
 Well, what makes you think you're secular then?

09:03.780 --> 09:07.460
 It's arguable that the thing many, many centuries from now

09:07.460 --> 09:11.660
 that will remain of all of human civilization will be our art.

09:11.660 --> 09:12.940
 Not even the words.

09:12.940 --> 09:16.620
 Well, a book has remained a very long time, right?

09:16.620 --> 09:17.660
 The biblical writings have.

09:17.660 --> 09:18.620
 Not that long.

09:18.620 --> 09:19.740
 A few millennia.

09:19.740 --> 09:21.100
 That's right.

09:21.100 --> 09:24.340
 But that's in the full arc of living organisms,

09:24.340 --> 09:25.180
 perhaps will not be.

09:25.180 --> 09:27.500
 Well, we have images that are, we

09:27.500 --> 09:30.660
 have artistic images that are at least 50,000 years old,

09:30.660 --> 09:32.340
 right, that have survived.

09:32.340 --> 09:35.220
 And some of those are, they're already

09:35.220 --> 09:36.740
 profound in their symbolism.

09:36.740 --> 09:38.220
 By we, do you mean humans?

09:38.220 --> 09:39.380
 Yeah, we found them.

09:39.380 --> 09:44.540
 And they've lasted, they've lasted that long.

09:44.540 --> 09:48.100
 And so, and then think about Europe.

09:48.100 --> 09:49.780
 Secular people all over the world

09:49.780 --> 09:51.860
 make pilgrimages to Europe.

09:51.860 --> 09:53.340
 Well, why?

09:53.340 --> 09:55.100
 Because of the beauty.

09:55.100 --> 09:58.620
 Obviously, I mean, that's self evident.

09:58.620 --> 10:00.780
 And it's partly because there are things

10:00.780 --> 10:02.020
 in Europe that are so beautiful.

10:02.020 --> 10:03.300
 They take your breath away, right?

10:03.300 --> 10:04.580
 They make your hair stand on end.

10:04.580 --> 10:07.540
 They fill you with a sense of awe.

10:07.540 --> 10:10.460
 And we need to see those things.

10:10.460 --> 10:11.380
 It's not optional.

10:11.380 --> 10:13.020
 We need to see those things.

10:13.020 --> 10:13.940
 The cathedrals.

10:13.940 --> 10:17.700
 I was in a cathedral in Vienna, and it was terribly beautiful.

10:17.700 --> 10:18.500
 Terribly beautiful.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.060
 Well, it was terribly beautiful.

10:20.060 --> 10:21.780
 Is beauty painful for you?

10:21.780 --> 10:24.300
 Is that the highest form of beauty?

10:24.300 --> 10:25.660
 It really challenges you?

10:25.660 --> 10:27.020
 Oh, definitely.

10:27.020 --> 10:27.620
 Yeah, yeah.

10:27.620 --> 10:29.940
 I got a good analysis of the statue of David.

10:29.940 --> 10:33.980
 Michelangelo says, you could be far more than you are.

10:33.980 --> 10:35.940
 That's what that statue says.

10:35.940 --> 10:41.140
 And this cathedral, we went down into the under structure of it.

10:41.140 --> 10:46.220
 And there were three floors of bones from the plague.

10:46.220 --> 10:47.540
 And there they all are.

10:47.540 --> 10:50.100
 And then that cathedral is on top of it.

10:50.100 --> 10:53.380
 It's no joke to go visit a place like that.

10:53.380 --> 10:56.340
 No, it rattles you to the core.

10:56.340 --> 11:03.340
 And our religious systems have become propositionally dubious.

11:03.340 --> 11:05.340
 But there's no arguing with the architecture,

11:05.340 --> 11:07.420
 although modern architects like to,

11:07.420 --> 11:10.660
 with their sterility and their giant middle fingers erected

11:10.660 --> 11:12.300
 everywhere.

11:12.300 --> 11:16.620
 But beauty is a terrible pointer to God.

11:16.620 --> 11:19.460
 And a secular person will say, well, I don't believe in God.

11:19.460 --> 11:22.580
 It's like, have it your way.

11:22.580 --> 11:23.700
 You got it.

11:23.700 --> 11:26.780
 You cannot move forward into the unforeseen horizon

11:26.780 --> 11:29.660
 of the future except on faith.

11:29.660 --> 11:31.360
 And you might say, well, I have no faith.

11:31.360 --> 11:33.360
 It's like, well, good luck with the future then.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.220
 Because what are you then, nihilistic and hopeless

11:36.220 --> 11:38.260
 and anxiety ridden?

11:38.260 --> 11:40.980
 And if not, well, something's guiding you forward.

11:40.980 --> 11:43.580
 It's faith in something or multiple things,

11:43.580 --> 11:45.940
 which just makes you a polytheist,

11:45.940 --> 11:48.100
 which I wouldn't recommend.

11:48.100 --> 11:52.780
 Well, let me ask you one short lived biological meat

11:52.780 --> 11:54.780
 bag to another.

11:54.780 --> 11:58.100
 Who is God then?

11:58.100 --> 12:00.300
 Let's try to sneak up to this question

12:00.300 --> 12:01.620
 if it's at all possible.

12:01.620 --> 12:04.980
 Is it possible to even talk about this?

12:04.980 --> 12:05.740
 Well, it better be.

12:05.740 --> 12:08.900
 Because otherwise, there's no communicating about it.

12:08.900 --> 12:12.300
 It has to be something that can be brought down to Earth.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.700
 Well, we might be too dumb to bring it down.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.020
 It's not just ignorant.

12:16.020 --> 12:20.540
 It's also sinful because there's not knowing.

12:20.540 --> 12:24.580
 And then there's wanting to know or refusing to know.

12:24.580 --> 12:26.980
 And so you might say, well, could you

12:26.980 --> 12:30.900
 extract God from a description of the objective world?

12:30.900 --> 12:36.940
 Is God just the ultimate unity of the natural reality?

12:36.940 --> 12:39.300
 And I would say, well, in a sense,

12:39.300 --> 12:41.720
 there's some truth in that, but not exactly.

12:41.720 --> 12:45.060
 Because God in the highest sense is the spirit

12:45.060 --> 12:49.060
 that you must emulate in order to thrive.

12:49.060 --> 12:51.460
 How's that for a biological definition?

12:51.460 --> 12:54.540
 Spirit is a pattern, the spirit that you must

12:54.540 --> 12:56.140
 emulate in order to thrive.

12:56.140 --> 13:01.500
 So it's a kind of, in one sense, when we say the human spirit,

13:01.500 --> 13:02.620
 it's that.

13:02.620 --> 13:04.380
 It's an animating principle.

13:04.380 --> 13:05.520
 Yeah, it's a meta.

13:05.520 --> 13:06.980
 It's a pattern.

13:06.980 --> 13:08.940
 And you might say, well, what's the pattern?

13:08.940 --> 13:11.340
 Well, I can tell you that to some degree.

13:11.340 --> 13:14.860
 Imagine that like your grip by beauty,

13:14.860 --> 13:17.420
 you're gripped by admiration.

13:17.420 --> 13:19.100
 And you can just notice this.

13:19.100 --> 13:20.300
 This isn't propositional.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.580
 You have to notice it.

13:21.580 --> 13:26.940
 It's like, oh, turns out I admire that person.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.260
 So what does that mean?

13:28.260 --> 13:31.740
 Well, it means I would like to be like him or her.

13:31.740 --> 13:32.940
 That's what admiration means.

13:32.940 --> 13:35.180
 It means there's something about the way

13:35.180 --> 13:40.100
 they are that compels imitation, another instinct,

13:40.100 --> 13:44.780
 or inspires respect or awe even.

13:44.780 --> 13:46.820
 What is that that grips you?

13:46.820 --> 13:49.340
 Well, I don't know.

13:49.340 --> 13:51.180
 Well, let's say, OK, fine.

13:51.180 --> 13:52.020
 But it grips you.

13:52.020 --> 13:53.380
 And you want to be like that.

13:53.380 --> 13:55.220
 Kids hero worship, for example.

13:55.220 --> 13:56.980
 So do adults, for that matter, unless they

13:56.980 --> 13:58.140
 become entirely cynical.

13:58.140 --> 14:00.380
 I worship quite a few heroes.

14:00.380 --> 14:01.740
 Well, there you go.

14:01.740 --> 14:03.380
 Yes, well, there you go.

14:03.380 --> 14:07.180
 And there's no, that worship, that celebration and proclivity

14:07.180 --> 14:08.460
 to imitate is worship.

14:08.460 --> 14:11.180
 That's what worship means most fundamentally.

14:11.180 --> 14:16.020
 Now, imagine you took the set of all admirable people

14:16.020 --> 14:18.940
 and you extracted out AI learning.

14:18.940 --> 14:20.940
 You extracted out the central features

14:20.940 --> 14:23.260
 of what constitutes admirable.

14:23.260 --> 14:25.860
 And then you did that repeatedly until you purified it

14:25.860 --> 14:29.220
 to what was most admirable.

14:29.220 --> 14:33.180
 That's as good as you're going to get in terms

14:33.180 --> 14:35.660
 of a representation of God.

14:35.660 --> 14:37.620
 And you might say, well, I don't believe in that.

14:37.620 --> 14:40.780
 It's like, well, what do you mean?

14:40.780 --> 14:43.780
 It's not a set of propositional facts.

14:43.780 --> 14:46.260
 It's not a scientific theory about the structure

14:46.260 --> 14:47.380
 of the objective world.

14:47.380 --> 14:49.060
 And then I could say something about that, too,

14:49.060 --> 14:50.900
 because I've been thinking about this a lot,

14:50.900 --> 14:53.300
 especially since talking to Richard Dawkins.

14:53.300 --> 14:57.260
 It's like, OK, the postmodernist types,

14:57.260 --> 14:59.580
 going back way before Derrida and Foucault,

14:59.580 --> 15:04.260
 maybe back to Nietzsche, who I admire greatly, by the way.

15:04.260 --> 15:06.500
 He says, God is dead.

15:06.500 --> 15:07.780
 It's like, OK.

15:07.780 --> 15:10.140
 But Nietzsche said, God is dead, and we have killed him,

15:10.140 --> 15:12.940
 and we'll not find enough water to wash away all the blood.

15:12.940 --> 15:14.180
 So that was Nietzsche.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.060
 He's no fool.

15:15.060 --> 15:16.100
 He's got away with words.

15:16.100 --> 15:17.740
 He certainly does.

15:17.740 --> 15:22.260
 And so then you think, OK, well, we killed the transcendent.

15:22.260 --> 15:24.700
 Well, what does that mean for science?

15:24.700 --> 15:28.260
 Well, it frees it up, because all that nonsense about a deity

15:28.260 --> 15:30.500
 is just the idiot superstition that

15:30.500 --> 15:35.500
 stops the scientific process from moving forward.

15:35.500 --> 15:38.580
 That's basically the new atheist claim, something like that.

15:38.580 --> 15:40.900
 It's like, wait a second.

15:40.900 --> 15:42.300
 Do you believe in the transcendent

15:42.300 --> 15:44.540
 if you're a scientist?

15:44.540 --> 15:47.820
 And the answer is, well, not only do you believe in it,

15:47.820 --> 15:49.580
 you believe in it more than anything else.

15:49.580 --> 15:51.900
 Because if you're a scientist, you

15:51.900 --> 15:56.180
 believe in what objects to your theory

15:56.180 --> 15:58.460
 more than you believe in your theory.

15:58.460 --> 16:00.500
 Now, we've got to think that through very carefully.

16:00.500 --> 16:01.940
 So your theory describes the world.

16:01.940 --> 16:05.380
 And as far as you're concerned, your description of the world

16:05.380 --> 16:07.220
 is the world.

16:07.220 --> 16:09.660
 But because you're a scientist, you think, well,

16:09.660 --> 16:11.900
 even though that's my description of the world

16:11.900 --> 16:14.020
 and that's what I believe, there's

16:14.020 --> 16:17.100
 something beyond what I believe.

16:17.100 --> 16:18.060
 And that's the object.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.340
 And so I'm going to throw my theory against the object

16:20.340 --> 16:21.940
 and see where it'll break.

16:21.940 --> 16:25.340
 And then I'm going to use the evidence of the break

16:25.340 --> 16:28.900
 as a source of new information to revitalize my theory.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.620
 So as a scientist, you have to posit

16:30.620 --> 16:33.900
 the existence of the ontological transcendent

16:33.900 --> 16:36.180
 before you can move forward at all.

16:36.180 --> 16:40.580
 But more, you have to posit that contact

16:40.580 --> 16:43.060
 with the ontological transcendent,

16:43.060 --> 16:46.420
 annoying though it is because it upsets your apple cart,

16:46.420 --> 16:49.740
 is exactly what will, in fact, set you free.

16:49.740 --> 16:51.380
 So then you accept the proposition

16:51.380 --> 16:54.500
 that there is a transcendent reality

16:54.500 --> 16:58.500
 and that contact with that transcendent reality

16:58.500 --> 17:00.980
 is redemptive in the most fundamental sense.

17:00.980 --> 17:02.500
 Because if it wasn't, well, why would you

17:02.500 --> 17:03.860
 bother making contact with it?

17:03.860 --> 17:06.300
 Is it going to make everything worse or better?

17:06.300 --> 17:10.100
 Why does the contact with the transcendent

17:10.100 --> 17:11.820
 set you free as a scientist?

17:11.820 --> 17:13.900
 Because you assume that, you assume,

17:13.900 --> 17:15.940
 I mean, freedom in the most fundamental sense.

17:15.940 --> 17:17.940
 It's like, well, freedom from want,

17:17.940 --> 17:21.060
 freedom from disease, freedom from ignorance, right?

17:21.060 --> 17:22.460
 That it informs you.

17:22.460 --> 17:24.900
 So it's the lie of science.

17:24.900 --> 17:27.380
 It is definitely that.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.140
 Yeah, it's the direction, let's say,

17:30.140 --> 17:31.460
 the directionality of science.

17:31.460 --> 17:34.340
 That's a narrative direction, not a scientific direction.

17:34.340 --> 17:36.500
 And then the question is, what is the narrative?

17:36.500 --> 17:38.860
 Well, it posits a transcendent reality.

17:38.860 --> 17:41.700
 It posits that the transcendent reality is corrective.

17:41.700 --> 17:43.540
 It posits that our knowledge structures

17:43.540 --> 17:46.060
 should be regarded with humility.

17:46.060 --> 17:48.260
 It posits that you should bow down

17:48.260 --> 17:51.860
 in the face of the transcendent evidence.

17:51.860 --> 17:53.300
 And you have to take a vow.

17:53.300 --> 17:54.540
 You know this as a scientist.

17:54.540 --> 17:56.700
 You have to take a vow to follow that path if you're

17:56.700 --> 17:57.900
 going to be a real scientist.

17:57.900 --> 18:01.740
 Like, the truth, no matter what, and that

18:01.740 --> 18:05.140
 means you posit the truth as a redemptive force.

18:05.140 --> 18:06.380
 Well, what does redemptive mean?

18:06.380 --> 18:07.700
 Well, why bother with science?

18:07.700 --> 18:09.140
 Well, so people don't starve.

18:09.140 --> 18:11.220
 So people can move about more effectively.

18:11.220 --> 18:12.980
 So life can be more abundant, right?

18:12.980 --> 18:16.700
 So it's all ensconced within an underlying ethic.

18:16.700 --> 18:19.740
 So the reason I was saying that while we were talking

18:19.740 --> 18:21.220
 about belief in God, it's like, this

18:21.220 --> 18:23.180
 is a very complicated topic, right?

18:23.180 --> 18:25.020
 Do you believe in a transcendent reality?

18:25.020 --> 18:28.860
 See, OK, now let's say you buy the argument I just

18:28.860 --> 18:30.020
 made on the natural front.

18:30.020 --> 18:33.300
 You say, yeah, yeah, that's just nature.

18:33.300 --> 18:35.660
 That's not God.

18:35.660 --> 18:37.380
 And then I'd say, well, what makes you think

18:37.380 --> 18:39.700
 you know what nature is?

18:39.700 --> 18:41.940
 Like, see, the problem with that argument

18:41.940 --> 18:45.460
 is that it already presumes a materialist,

18:45.460 --> 18:48.180
 a reductionist, materialist, objective view

18:48.180 --> 18:50.140
 of what constitutes nature.

18:50.140 --> 18:52.540
 But if you're a scientist, you're going to think,

18:52.540 --> 18:54.980
 well, in the final analysis, I don't know what nature is.

18:54.980 --> 18:58.140
 I certainly don't know its origin or destination point.

18:58.140 --> 19:00.100
 I don't know its teleology.

19:00.100 --> 19:02.620
 I'm really ignorant about nature.

19:02.620 --> 19:05.420
 And so when I say it's nothing but nature,

19:05.420 --> 19:07.700
 I shouldn't mean it's nothing but what

19:07.700 --> 19:10.460
 I understand nature to be.

19:10.460 --> 19:13.300
 So I could say, will we have a fully reductionist account

19:13.300 --> 19:16.060
 of cognitive processes?

19:16.060 --> 19:17.380
 And the answer to that is yes.

19:17.380 --> 19:20.700
 But by the time we do that, our understanding of matter

19:20.700 --> 19:22.700
 will have transformed so much that what

19:22.700 --> 19:25.820
 we think of as reductionists now won't look anything like what

19:25.820 --> 19:27.940
 we think of reductionism now.

19:27.940 --> 19:30.780
 Matter isn't dead dust.

19:30.780 --> 19:32.500
 I don't know what it is.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.020
 I have no idea what it is.

19:34.020 --> 19:35.820
 Matter is what matters.

19:35.820 --> 19:37.180
 There is a definition.

19:37.180 --> 19:39.300
 That's a very weird definition.

19:39.300 --> 19:42.540
 But the notion that we have, you know,

19:42.540 --> 19:44.980
 that if you're a reductionist, a materialist reductionist,

19:44.980 --> 19:47.940
 that you can reduce the complexity of what

19:47.940 --> 19:51.780
 is to your assumptions about the nature of matter,

19:51.780 --> 19:53.260
 that's not a scientific proposition.

19:53.260 --> 19:56.660
 Your specific limited human assumptions of this century,

19:56.660 --> 20:01.700
 of this week, that so in some sense,

20:01.700 --> 20:06.180
 without God in this complicated big definition

20:06.180 --> 20:10.460
 we're talking about, there's no humility.

20:10.460 --> 20:16.500
 Or it's less likely to be, or rather science

20:16.500 --> 20:20.740
 can err in taking a trajectory away from humility.

20:20.740 --> 20:21.340
 Well.

20:21.340 --> 20:23.980
 Without something much more powerful

20:23.980 --> 20:26.100
 than an individual human.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.820
 Yeah, well then and we know, you know,

20:27.820 --> 20:30.420
 the Frankenstein story comes out of that instantly.

20:30.420 --> 20:33.700
 And that's a good story for the current times.

20:33.700 --> 20:38.820
 It's like you're playing around with making new life.

20:38.820 --> 20:43.340
 You bloody well better make sure you have your arrows pointed up.

20:43.340 --> 20:49.340
 And it's interesting because you said science has an ethic to it.

20:49.340 --> 20:51.300
 I think it's embedded in an ethic.

20:51.300 --> 20:55.740
 Well, there's a, you know, science is a big word.

20:55.740 --> 20:57.220
 And it includes a lot of disciplines

20:57.220 --> 20:58.500
 that have different traditions.

20:58.500 --> 21:04.180
 So biology, chemistry, genetics, physics,

21:04.180 --> 21:06.620
 those are very different communities.

21:06.620 --> 21:09.020
 And I think biology, especially when

21:09.020 --> 21:12.140
 you get closer and closer to medicine and to the human body,

21:12.140 --> 21:14.460
 does have a very serious, first of all,

21:14.460 --> 21:16.740
 has a history with Nazi Germany of being abused

21:16.740 --> 21:18.220
 and all those kinds of things.

21:18.220 --> 21:21.060
 But it has a history of taking this stuff seriously.

21:21.060 --> 21:23.620
 What doesn't have a history of taking this stuff seriously

21:23.620 --> 21:25.700
 is robotics and artificial intelligence,

21:25.700 --> 21:27.300
 which is really interesting.

21:27.300 --> 21:32.260
 Because you don't, you know, you called me a scientist.

21:32.260 --> 21:34.900
 And I would like to wear that label proudly,

21:34.900 --> 21:38.820
 but often people don't think of computer science as a science.

21:38.820 --> 21:41.500
 But nevertheless, it will be, I think,

21:41.500 --> 21:44.820
 the science of one of the major scientific fields

21:44.820 --> 21:46.260
 of the 21st century.

21:46.260 --> 21:48.660
 And you should take that very seriously.

21:48.660 --> 21:52.540
 Oftentimes when people build robots or AI systems,

21:52.540 --> 21:57.180
 they think of them as toys to tinker with.

21:57.180 --> 21:59.180
 Oh, isn't this cool?

21:59.180 --> 22:00.420
 And I feel this too.

22:00.420 --> 22:01.260
 Isn't this cool?

22:01.260 --> 22:02.420
 It is cool.

22:02.420 --> 22:05.820
 But, you know, at a certain moment you might,

22:05.820 --> 22:09.340
 isn't this nuclear explosion cool?

22:09.340 --> 22:10.380
 Because it is.

22:10.380 --> 22:12.140
 Or birth control pill cool.

22:12.140 --> 22:14.900
 It's like, or transistor cool.

22:14.900 --> 22:15.620
 Yeah.

22:15.620 --> 22:19.220
 Well, the other thing too, and this is a weird problem

22:19.220 --> 22:22.380
 in some sense, the robotics engineer types,

22:22.380 --> 22:23.940
 they're thing people, right?

22:23.940 --> 22:25.980
 I mean, the big classes of interest

22:25.980 --> 22:28.700
 are interest in things versus interest in people.

22:28.700 --> 22:30.700
 Some of my best friends are thing people.

22:30.700 --> 22:31.380
 Yeah, right.

22:31.380 --> 22:36.940
 And thing people are very, very clear, logical thinkers.

22:36.940 --> 22:41.060
 And they're very outcome oriented and practical.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.220
 Now, and that's all good.

22:43.220 --> 22:45.980
 That makes the machinery and keeps it functioning.

22:45.980 --> 22:49.260
 But there's a human side of the equation.

22:49.260 --> 22:52.500
 And you get the extreme thing people,

22:52.500 --> 22:55.220
 and you think, yeah, well, what about the human here?

22:55.220 --> 22:58.260
 And when we're talking about, we've

22:58.260 --> 23:00.020
 been talking about the necessity of having

23:00.020 --> 23:03.340
 a technological enterprise embedded in an ethic.

23:03.340 --> 23:06.300
 And you can ignore that, like most of the time, right?

23:06.300 --> 23:09.420
 You can ignore the overall ethic in some sense

23:09.420 --> 23:11.820
 when you're toying around with your toys.

23:11.820 --> 23:14.020
 But when you're building an artificial intelligence,

23:14.020 --> 23:19.060
 it's like, well, that's not a toy.

23:19.060 --> 23:20.500
 That might be.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.500
 Toy becomes the monster very quickly.

23:22.500 --> 23:23.860
 Yeah, yes, yes.

23:23.860 --> 23:26.860
 And this is a whole new kind of monster.

23:26.860 --> 23:28.340
 And maybe it's already here.

23:33.220 --> 23:35.060
 Yes, and you notice how many of those things

23:35.060 --> 23:36.460
 you can no longer turn off.

23:38.980 --> 23:41.180
 And what is it with you engineers and your inability

23:41.180 --> 23:44.620
 to put off switches on things now?

23:44.620 --> 23:47.100
 It's like, I have to hold this for five seconds for it

23:47.100 --> 23:48.060
 to shut off.

23:48.060 --> 23:48.900
 Or I can't figure it.

23:48.900 --> 23:50.660
 I just want to shut it off.

23:50.660 --> 23:51.780
 Click, off.

23:51.780 --> 23:53.980
 Well, what is it with you humans that

23:53.980 --> 23:56.980
 don't put off switches on other humans?

23:56.980 --> 23:59.500
 Because there's a magic to the thing that you notice.

23:59.500 --> 24:03.860
 And it hurts for both you and perhaps one day the thing

24:03.860 --> 24:05.860
 itself to turn it off.

24:05.860 --> 24:08.180
 And so you have to be very careful as an engineer

24:08.180 --> 24:11.300
 adding off switches to things.

24:11.300 --> 24:14.460
 I think it's a feature, not a bug, the off switch.

24:14.460 --> 24:17.020
 The off switch gives a deadline to us humans,

24:17.020 --> 24:19.740
 to systems of existence.

24:19.740 --> 24:23.980
 It makes you, you know, death is the thing that really

24:23.980 --> 24:25.980
 brings clarity to life.

24:25.980 --> 24:27.060
 And I do think.

24:27.060 --> 24:28.820
 Hence the flaming swords.

24:28.820 --> 24:29.620
 The flaming sword.

24:29.620 --> 24:33.260
 I do like your view of the flame, the bush,

24:33.260 --> 24:36.700
 and perhaps the sword as a thing of transformation.

24:36.700 --> 24:40.260
 It's also a transformation that kind of consumes

24:40.260 --> 24:41.380
 the thing in the process.

24:41.380 --> 24:44.300
 Well, it depends on how much of the thing is chaff.

24:44.300 --> 24:47.780
 You know, this is why you can't touch the Ark of the Covenant,

24:47.780 --> 24:48.660
 for example.

24:48.660 --> 24:52.020
 And this is why people can have very bad psychedelic trips.

24:52.020 --> 24:54.940
 It's like if you're 95% dead wood

24:54.940 --> 24:57.140
 and you get too close to the flame,

24:57.140 --> 25:00.460
 the 5% that's left might not be able to make it.

25:03.260 --> 25:04.660
 So you think it's all chaff.

25:04.660 --> 25:06.980
 But I think there is some aspect of destruction

25:06.980 --> 25:12.540
 that is the old Bukowski line of do what you love

25:12.540 --> 25:13.700
 and let it kill you.

25:13.700 --> 25:16.540
 Don't you think that destruction is part of?

25:16.540 --> 25:18.180
 That's humility.

25:18.180 --> 25:19.020
 That's humility.

25:19.020 --> 25:19.620
 You bet.

25:19.620 --> 25:20.140
 You bet.

25:20.140 --> 25:20.660
 You bet.

25:20.660 --> 25:23.140
 It's like invite in the judgment.

25:23.140 --> 25:24.700
 Invite in the judgment because maybe you

25:24.700 --> 25:27.900
 can die a little bit instead of dying completely.

25:27.900 --> 25:30.220
 I think it's Alfred North Whitehead.

25:30.220 --> 25:33.380
 We can let our ideas die instead of us.

25:33.380 --> 25:35.700
 We can have these partial personalities

25:35.700 --> 25:37.460
 that we can burn off.

25:37.460 --> 25:41.020
 And we can let them go before they become tyrannical pharaohs

25:41.020 --> 25:43.380
 and we lose everything.

25:43.380 --> 25:46.420
 And so, yeah, there's this optimal bite of death.

25:46.420 --> 25:49.620
 And who knows what it would mean to optimize that?

25:49.620 --> 25:52.500
 Like what if it was possible that if you died enough

25:52.500 --> 25:56.220
 all the time that you could continue to live?

25:56.220 --> 25:58.300
 And the thing is we already know that biologically

25:58.300 --> 26:02.500
 because if you don't die properly all the time,

26:02.500 --> 26:05.660
 well, it's cancerous outgrowths and it's

26:05.660 --> 26:09.660
 a very fine balance between productivity

26:09.660 --> 26:14.060
 on the biological front and the culling of that, right?

26:14.060 --> 26:17.820
 Life is a real balance between growth and death.

26:17.820 --> 26:20.340
 And so what would happen if you got that balance right?

26:20.340 --> 26:21.540
 Well, we kind of know, right?

26:21.540 --> 26:26.100
 Because if you live your life properly, so to speak,

26:26.100 --> 26:28.780
 and you're humble enough to let your stupidity die

26:28.780 --> 26:32.060
 before it takes you out, you will live longer.

26:32.060 --> 26:34.180
 That's just a fact.

26:34.180 --> 26:37.140
 Well, but then what's the ultimate extension of that?

26:37.140 --> 26:38.740
 And the answer is we don't know.

26:38.740 --> 26:40.180
 We have no idea.

26:40.180 --> 26:42.980
 Well, let me ask you a difficult question because.

26:42.980 --> 26:45.700
 As opposed to the easy ones that you've been asking so far.

26:45.700 --> 26:50.900
 Well, Dostoevsky is always just a warm up.

26:50.900 --> 26:54.660
 So if death every single day is the way

26:54.660 --> 26:58.660
 to progress through life, you have become quite famous.

26:58.660 --> 27:00.180
 Death and hell.

27:00.180 --> 27:00.860
 Death and hell.

27:00.860 --> 27:01.380
 Yeah, yeah.

27:01.380 --> 27:04.620
 Because you don't want to forget the hell part.

27:04.620 --> 27:10.820
 Do you worry that your fame traps you into the person

27:10.820 --> 27:12.220
 that you were before?

27:12.220 --> 27:15.260
 Yeah, well, Elvis became an Elvis impersonator

27:15.260 --> 27:16.460
 by the time he died.

27:16.460 --> 27:19.180
 Yeah, do you fear that you have become a Jordan Peterson

27:19.180 --> 27:20.660
 impersonator?

27:20.660 --> 27:25.860
 Do you fear of, in some part, becoming the famous suit

27:25.860 --> 27:31.420
 wearing brilliant Jordan Peterson, the certainty in the pursuit

27:31.420 --> 27:34.860
 of truth, always right?

27:34.860 --> 27:36.940
 I think I worry about it more than anything else.

27:36.940 --> 27:38.060
 I hope.

27:38.060 --> 27:39.220
 I hope I do.

27:39.220 --> 27:39.940
 I better.

27:39.940 --> 27:43.100
 Has fame, to some degree, when you look at yourself

27:43.100 --> 27:47.700
 in the mirror, in the quiet of your mind, has it corrupted you?

27:47.700 --> 27:50.180
 No doubt, in some regard.

27:50.180 --> 27:51.660
 I mean, it's a very difficult thing

27:51.660 --> 27:57.100
 to avoid because things change around you.

27:57.100 --> 28:01.860
 People are much more likely to do what you ask, for example.

28:01.860 --> 28:03.860
 And so that's a danger because one

28:03.860 --> 28:05.980
 of the things that keeps you dying properly

28:05.980 --> 28:08.820
 is that people push back against you optimally.

28:08.820 --> 28:11.540
 This is why so many celebrities spiral out of control,

28:11.540 --> 28:15.180
 especially the tyrannical types that, say, run countries.

28:15.180 --> 28:17.380
 Everyone around them stops saying,

28:17.380 --> 28:20.140
 yeah, you're deviating a little bit there.

28:20.140 --> 28:21.540
 They laugh at all their jokes.

28:21.540 --> 28:22.780
 They open all their doors.

28:22.780 --> 28:25.300
 They always want something from them.

28:25.300 --> 28:27.300
 The red carpet's always rolled out.

28:27.300 --> 28:29.820
 It's like, well, you think, wouldn't that be lovely?

28:29.820 --> 28:34.020
 It's, well, not if the red carpet is rolled out to you

28:34.020 --> 28:36.300
 while you're on your way to perdition.

28:36.300 --> 28:37.860
 That's not a good deal.

28:37.860 --> 28:40.060
 You just get there more efficiently.

28:40.060 --> 28:43.180
 And so one of the things that I've tried to learn to manage

28:43.180 --> 28:48.300
 is to have people around me all the time who are critics, who

28:48.300 --> 28:50.660
 are saying, yeah, I could have done that better.

28:50.660 --> 28:52.820
 And you're a little too harsh there.

28:52.820 --> 28:55.620
 And you're alienating people unnecessarily there.

28:55.620 --> 28:58.940
 And you should have done some more background work there.

28:58.940 --> 29:02.140
 And I think the responsibility attendant upon that

29:02.140 --> 29:04.700
 increases as your influence increases.

29:04.700 --> 29:08.900
 And as your influence increases, then that

29:08.900 --> 29:12.340
 becomes a lot of responsibility.

29:12.340 --> 29:14.820
 So and then maybe have an off day.

29:14.820 --> 29:17.140
 And well, here's an example.

29:17.140 --> 29:19.260
 I've been writing some columns lately

29:19.260 --> 29:24.180
 about things that perturb me, like the forthcoming famine,

29:24.180 --> 29:25.460
 for example.

29:25.460 --> 29:30.980
 And it's hard to take those problems on.

29:30.980 --> 29:34.020
 It's difficult to take those problems on in a serious

29:34.020 --> 29:35.380
 manner, and it's frightening.

29:35.380 --> 29:37.500
 And it would be easier just to go up to the cottage

29:37.500 --> 29:40.740
 with my wife and go out on the lake and watch the sunset.

29:40.740 --> 29:48.100
 And so I'm tempted to draw on anger as a motivating energy

29:48.100 --> 29:52.020
 to help me overcome the resistance to doing this.

29:52.020 --> 29:54.620
 But then that makes me more harsh and judgmental

29:54.620 --> 29:57.940
 in my tone when I'm reading such things, for example,

29:57.940 --> 30:00.260
 on YouTube than might be optimal.

30:00.260 --> 30:03.260
 Now, I've had debates with people about that

30:03.260 --> 30:05.540
 because I have friends who say, no,

30:05.540 --> 30:10.500
 if you're calling out the environmentalists, globalists

30:10.500 --> 30:12.820
 who are harassing the Dutch farmers,

30:12.820 --> 30:15.860
 then a little anger is just the ticket.

30:15.860 --> 30:18.900
 But then others say, well, you don't want to be too harsh

30:18.900 --> 30:22.020
 because you alienate people who would otherwise listen to you.

30:22.020 --> 30:24.900
 It's like, that's a hard balance to get right.

30:24.900 --> 30:28.420
 But also maybe anger hardens your mind

30:28.420 --> 30:31.220
 to where you don't notice the subtle quiet beauty

30:31.220 --> 30:34.580
 of the world, the quiet love that's always there

30:34.580 --> 30:36.140
 that permeates everything.

30:36.140 --> 30:38.900
 Sometimes you can become deeply cynical about the world

30:38.900 --> 30:41.820
 if it's the Nietzsche thing.

30:41.820 --> 30:45.740
 Battle not with monsters lest ye become a monster.

30:45.740 --> 30:47.420
 And if you gaze into the abyss,

30:47.420 --> 30:50.780
 the abyss gazes also into you.

30:50.780 --> 30:54.020
 But I would say, bring it on.

30:56.260 --> 30:58.620
 Right, because I also say knowing

30:58.620 --> 30:59.980
 that he's absolutely right.

30:59.980 --> 31:03.380
 But if you gaze into the abyss long enough,

31:03.380 --> 31:05.340
 you see the light, not the darkness.

31:06.140 --> 31:08.300
 Are you sure about that?

31:08.300 --> 31:10.540
 I'm betting my life on it.

31:10.540 --> 31:12.140
 Yeah, that's a heck of a bet.

31:12.140 --> 31:12.980
 Well, that's.

31:12.980 --> 31:17.460
 Because it might distort your mind to where all you see.

31:17.460 --> 31:18.300
 Is abyss.

31:18.300 --> 31:21.140
 Is abyss, is the evil in this world.

31:21.140 --> 31:24.140
 Well, then I would say you haven't looked long enough.

31:24.140 --> 31:25.860
 You know, that's back to the.

31:25.860 --> 31:26.700
 You just eliminated.

31:26.700 --> 31:28.380
 The swords, the flaming swords.

31:28.380 --> 31:31.060
 It's like, so I said the whole story of Christ

31:31.060 --> 31:33.260
 was prefigured in that image.

31:33.260 --> 31:36.820
 It's like the story of Christ psychologically

31:36.820 --> 31:40.860
 is radical acceptance of the worst possible tragedy.

31:40.860 --> 31:42.940
 That's what it means, that's what the crucifix means.

31:42.940 --> 31:45.100
 Psychologically, it's like gaze upon that

31:45.100 --> 31:46.700
 which you are most afraid of.

31:46.700 --> 31:48.500
 But that story doesn't end there.

31:48.500 --> 31:53.420
 Because in the story, Christ goes through death into hell.

31:53.420 --> 31:55.260
 So death isn't enough.

31:55.260 --> 31:57.740
 The abyss, the abyss of innocent death

31:57.740 --> 32:00.660
 is not sufficient to produce redemption.

32:00.660 --> 32:03.100
 It has to be a voluntary journey to hell.

32:03.100 --> 32:04.860
 And maybe that's true for everyone.

32:06.180 --> 32:09.380
 And that's like, there is no more terrifying idea than that,

32:09.380 --> 32:10.260
 by definition.

32:10.260 --> 32:13.180
 And so then, well, do you gaze upon that?

32:13.180 --> 32:17.700
 Well, who knows?

32:17.700 --> 32:18.540
 Who knows?

32:18.540 --> 32:22.460
 How often do you gaze upon death, your own?

32:22.460 --> 32:26.060
 How often do you remember, remind yourself

32:26.060 --> 32:27.460
 that this ride ends?

32:27.460 --> 32:28.300
 Personally?

32:28.300 --> 32:29.540
 Personally.

32:29.540 --> 32:30.740
 All the time.

32:30.740 --> 32:33.700
 Because you, as a deep thinker and a philosopher,

32:33.700 --> 32:36.300
 it's easy to start philosophizing

32:36.300 --> 32:39.300
 and forgetting that you're,

32:39.300 --> 32:40.300
 you might die today.

32:40.300 --> 32:42.220
 The angel of death sits on every word.

32:43.620 --> 32:44.460
 How's that?

32:45.700 --> 32:48.100
 How often do you actually consciously?

32:48.100 --> 32:49.620
 All the time.

32:49.620 --> 32:50.660
 Notice the angel?

32:50.660 --> 32:51.500
 All the time.

32:53.980 --> 32:57.700
 I think it's one of the things that made me peculiar.

32:57.700 --> 32:59.980
 When I was in graduate school, you know,

32:59.980 --> 33:03.140
 I thought about, I was, I had the thought of death

33:03.140 --> 33:05.180
 in my mind all the time.

33:05.180 --> 33:07.380
 And I noticed that many of the people that I was with,

33:07.380 --> 33:09.940
 these were people I admired, fine.

33:09.940 --> 33:12.100
 That wasn't part of their character,

33:12.100 --> 33:13.820
 but it was definitely part of mine.

33:13.820 --> 33:17.020
 I'd wake up every morning, this happened for years,

33:17.020 --> 33:19.740
 think, time's short, get at it.

33:19.740 --> 33:21.580
 Time's short, get at it.

33:21.580 --> 33:22.620
 There's things to do.

33:23.580 --> 33:25.620
 And so that was always, it's still there.

33:25.620 --> 33:27.860
 And it's still there with, I would say,

33:27.860 --> 33:30.060
 and it's unbearable in some sense.

33:30.060 --> 33:31.220
 Are you afraid of it?

33:31.220 --> 33:32.980
 Like what's your relationship?

33:32.980 --> 33:33.820
 Yeah.

33:33.820 --> 33:38.820
 You know, I was ready to die a year ago and not casually.

33:40.420 --> 33:42.260
 I had people I loved, you know.

33:47.100 --> 33:49.460
 So no, I'm not very worried about me,

33:49.460 --> 33:52.100
 but I'm very worried about making a mistake.

33:52.100 --> 33:53.260
 Yeah.

33:53.260 --> 33:55.540
 I heard Elon Musk talk about that a couple of months ago.

33:55.540 --> 33:57.860
 It was really a striking moment.

33:57.860 --> 34:00.620
 Someone asked him about death and he said just offhand

34:00.620 --> 34:02.100
 and then went on with the conversation.

34:02.100 --> 34:03.420
 He said, I'd be a relief.

34:03.420 --> 34:05.460
 And then he went on with the conversation.

34:06.780 --> 34:09.420
 And I thought, well, you know,

34:09.420 --> 34:11.740
 he's got a lot of weight on his shoulders.

34:11.740 --> 34:13.340
 I'm sure that part of him thinks

34:14.300 --> 34:18.100
 I'd be easier just if this wasn't here at all.

34:18.100 --> 34:19.500
 Now he said it offhand,

34:19.500 --> 34:21.900
 but it was a telling moment in my estimation.

34:21.900 --> 34:26.060
 So for him, that's a why live question.

34:26.060 --> 34:30.220
 The exhaustion of life, if you call it life is suffering,

34:30.220 --> 34:32.260
 but the hardship.

34:32.260 --> 34:33.940
 I'm more afraid of hell than death.

34:36.380 --> 34:38.860
 You're afraid of the thing that follows?

34:40.140 --> 34:42.660
 I don't know if it follows or if it's always here.

34:44.420 --> 34:46.020
 And I think we're gonna find out.

34:47.300 --> 34:50.180
 What's the connection between death and hell?

34:50.180 --> 34:51.020
 I don't know.

34:53.380 --> 34:54.540
 I don't know.

34:54.540 --> 34:55.380
 I don't know.

34:55.380 --> 34:58.500
 Is there something that needs to be done before you arrive?

34:58.500 --> 35:00.300
 You're more likely to die terribly

35:00.300 --> 35:03.780
 if you live in a manner that brings you to hell.

35:03.780 --> 35:04.900
 That's one connection.

35:04.900 --> 35:08.620
 And terribly is a very deep kind of concept.

35:08.620 --> 35:09.460
 Okay.

35:09.460 --> 35:10.300
 Yeah, yeah.

35:13.020 --> 35:14.980
 And that's the definition, by the way.

35:16.220 --> 35:17.820
 What do you make of Elon Musk?

35:17.820 --> 35:19.500
 You've spoken about him a bit.

35:19.500 --> 35:20.340
 You met him.

35:20.340 --> 35:21.420
 I'm struck with admiration.

35:22.660 --> 35:23.500
 That's what I make of him.

35:23.500 --> 35:26.820
 And I always think of that as a primary.

35:26.820 --> 35:29.980
 Well, it's like, do you find this comedian funny?

35:29.980 --> 35:31.940
 It's like, well, I laugh at him.

35:31.940 --> 35:32.780
 You know what I mean?

35:32.780 --> 35:34.780
 It's not propositional again.

35:34.780 --> 35:36.660
 And so I would,

35:36.660 --> 35:41.020
 there are things I would like to ask Mr. Musk about.

35:41.020 --> 35:42.660
 The Mars venture.

35:42.660 --> 35:44.260
 I don't know what he's up to there.

35:44.260 --> 35:47.900
 It strikes me as absurd in the most fundamental sense

35:47.900 --> 35:49.100
 because I think, well, it'd be easier

35:49.100 --> 35:52.300
 just to build an outpost in the Antarctica or in the desert.

35:52.300 --> 35:54.340
 Well, how much of the human endeavor is absurd?

35:54.340 --> 35:56.940
 Well, that's what it needs to say.

35:56.940 --> 35:59.620
 Great men are seldom credited with their stupidity.

35:59.620 --> 36:01.580
 Who the hell knows what Musk is up to?

36:01.580 --> 36:03.860
 I mean, obviously he's building rockets.

36:03.860 --> 36:06.100
 Now he's motivated because he wants to build

36:06.100 --> 36:08.980
 a platform for life on Mars.

36:08.980 --> 36:10.220
 Is that a good idea?

36:11.580 --> 36:13.300
 Who am I to say?

36:13.300 --> 36:14.860
 He's building the rockets, man.

36:14.860 --> 36:16.700
 But I'd like to ask him about it.

36:16.700 --> 36:19.300
 I would like to see that conversation.

36:19.300 --> 36:24.300
 I do think that having talked to him quite a bit offline,

36:24.580 --> 36:29.260
 I think these, several of his ideas like Mars,

36:29.260 --> 36:31.900
 like humans becoming a multi planetary species

36:31.900 --> 36:35.580
 could be one of the things that human civilization

36:35.580 --> 36:39.740
 looks back at as, duh, I can't believe

36:39.740 --> 36:42.100
 he is one of the few people that was really pushing

36:42.100 --> 36:45.140
 this idea because it's the obvious thing

36:45.140 --> 36:48.140
 for society, for life to survive.

36:48.140 --> 36:49.540
 Yeah, well, it isn't obvious to me

36:49.540 --> 36:52.580
 that I'm in any position to evaluate Elon Musk.

36:52.580 --> 36:53.820
 Like I would like to talk to him

36:53.820 --> 36:55.460
 and find out what he's up to and why,

36:55.460 --> 36:58.620
 but I mean, he's an impossible person.

36:58.620 --> 37:01.420
 What he's done is impossible, all of it.

37:01.420 --> 37:03.580
 It's like he built an electric car that works.

37:03.580 --> 37:06.420
 Now, does it work completely and will it replace gas cars

37:06.420 --> 37:07.260
 or should it?

37:07.260 --> 37:10.700
 I don't know, but if we're gonna build electric cars,

37:10.700 --> 37:14.220
 he seems to be the best at that by a lot.

37:14.220 --> 37:16.740
 And he more or less did that, people carp about him,

37:16.740 --> 37:18.980
 but he more or less did that by himself.

37:18.980 --> 37:21.460
 I know he's very good at distributing responsibility

37:21.460 --> 37:23.260
 and all of that, but he's the spearhead.

37:23.260 --> 37:25.140
 And then that was pretty hard.

37:25.140 --> 37:28.780
 And then he built a rocket at like one 10th

37:28.780 --> 37:30.620
 the price of NASA rockets.

37:30.620 --> 37:33.380
 And then he shot his car out into space.

37:33.380 --> 37:34.860
 That's pretty hard.

37:34.860 --> 37:38.020
 And then he's building this boring company,

37:38.020 --> 37:41.180
 more or less as a, what would you call it?

37:41.180 --> 37:44.500
 It's sort of, it's this whimsical joke in some sense,

37:44.500 --> 37:46.260
 but it's not a joke.

37:46.260 --> 37:47.300
 He's amazing.

37:47.300 --> 37:51.380
 And Neuralink delving into the depths of the mind.

37:51.380 --> 37:52.220
 And Starlink.

37:52.220 --> 37:55.220
 It's like, go Elon, as far as I'm concerned.

37:55.220 --> 37:58.540
 And then he puts his finger on things so oddly.

37:58.540 --> 38:01.220
 The problem is underpopulation.

38:01.220 --> 38:02.540
 It's like, I think so too.

38:02.540 --> 38:05.220
 I think it's a terrible problem that we're,

38:05.220 --> 38:09.860
 the West for example, is no longer at replacement

38:09.860 --> 38:10.980
 with regard to birth rate.

38:10.980 --> 38:13.380
 It means we've abandoned the Virgin and the child

38:13.380 --> 38:14.940
 in a most fundamental sense.

38:14.940 --> 38:16.860
 It's a bloody catastrophe.

38:16.860 --> 38:19.980
 And Musk, he sees it clear as can be.

38:19.980 --> 38:22.500
 It's like, wow, and where everyone else is running around

38:22.500 --> 38:24.100
 going, oh, there's too many people.

38:24.100 --> 38:26.860
 It's like, nope, got that.

38:26.860 --> 38:30.220
 Not only, see, I've learned that there are falsehoods

38:30.220 --> 38:33.260
 and lies and there are antitruths.

38:33.260 --> 38:36.060
 And an antitruth is something that's so preposterous

38:36.060 --> 38:39.620
 that you couldn't make a claim

38:39.620 --> 38:42.660
 that's more opposite to the truth.

38:42.660 --> 38:44.940
 And the claim that there are too many people

38:44.940 --> 38:46.740
 on the planet is an antitruth.

38:46.740 --> 38:50.580
 So, you know, people say, well, you have to accept

38:50.580 --> 38:52.060
 limits to growth and et cetera.

38:52.060 --> 38:56.300
 It's like, I have to accept the limits

38:56.300 --> 38:58.260
 that you're going to impose on me

38:58.260 --> 39:00.700
 because you're frightened of the future.

39:00.700 --> 39:02.500
 That's your theory, isn't it?

39:02.500 --> 39:03.340
 Okay.

39:04.460 --> 39:05.700
 Well, it's an idea.

39:05.700 --> 39:07.060
 It could be a right idea.

39:07.060 --> 39:08.340
 It could be a wrong idea.

39:08.340 --> 39:09.940
 I don't think antitruth.

39:11.140 --> 39:13.740
 Here, I'll tell you why it's the wrong idea, I think.

39:13.740 --> 39:17.540
 So imagine that there's an emergency, dragon.

39:17.540 --> 39:19.140
 There's a dragon.

39:19.140 --> 39:21.140
 Someone comes and says, there's a dragon.

39:21.140 --> 39:22.620
 I'm the guy to deal with it.

39:23.500 --> 39:25.100
 That's what the environmentalists say,

39:25.100 --> 39:28.540
 the radical types who push limits to growth.

39:28.540 --> 39:30.460
 Then I look at them and I think, okay,

39:31.940 --> 39:34.420
 is that dragon real or not?

39:34.420 --> 39:35.700
 That's one question.

39:35.700 --> 39:36.540
 Well, is the...

39:36.540 --> 39:38.100
 I ask that question of myself every time

39:38.100 --> 39:39.180
 when I spend time alone.

39:39.180 --> 39:42.220
 Is the apocalypse looming on the environmental front?

39:42.220 --> 39:45.740
 Yes or no? I'll just leave that aside for the time being.

39:45.740 --> 39:47.700
 I think you can make a case both ways

39:47.700 --> 39:49.460
 for a bunch of different reasons.

39:49.460 --> 39:51.660
 And it's not a trivial concern.

39:51.660 --> 39:54.100
 And we've overfished the oceans terribly.

39:54.100 --> 39:58.340
 And there are environmental issues that are looming large.

39:58.340 --> 40:00.980
 Whether climate change is the cardinal one or not

40:00.980 --> 40:03.660
 is a whole different question, but we won't get into that.

40:03.660 --> 40:04.940
 That's not the issue.

40:04.940 --> 40:07.100
 You're clamoring about a dragon.

40:07.100 --> 40:08.660
 Okay.

40:08.660 --> 40:10.460
 Why should I listen to you?

40:10.460 --> 40:13.460
 Well, let's see how you're reacting to the dragon.

40:13.460 --> 40:16.500
 First of all, you're scared stiff and in a state of panic.

40:17.780 --> 40:20.940
 That might indicate you're not the man for the job.

40:20.940 --> 40:24.500
 Second, you're willing to use compulsion

40:24.500 --> 40:27.620
 to harness other people to fight the dragon for you.

40:27.620 --> 40:30.260
 So now not only are you terrified,

40:30.260 --> 40:32.540
 you're a terrified tyrant.

40:32.540 --> 40:34.860
 So then I would say, well, then you're not the Moses

40:34.860 --> 40:38.580
 that we need to lead us out of this particular exodus.

40:38.580 --> 40:41.460
 And maybe that's a neurological explanation.

40:41.460 --> 40:45.060
 It's like, if you're so afraid of what you're facing

40:45.060 --> 40:47.940
 that you're terrified into paralysis and nihilism

40:47.940 --> 40:50.340
 and that you're willing to use tyrannical compulsion

40:50.340 --> 40:54.300
 to get your way, you are not the right leader for the time.

40:54.300 --> 40:56.340
 So then I like someone like Bjorn Lomborg

40:56.340 --> 40:59.100
 or Matt Ridley or Marion Toopy.

40:59.100 --> 41:00.580
 And they say, well, look,

41:00.580 --> 41:03.140
 we've got our environmental problems.

41:03.140 --> 41:06.860
 And maybe you could make a case

41:06.860 --> 41:11.100
 that there's a Malthusian element in some situations,

41:11.100 --> 41:14.540
 but fundamentally the track record of the human race

41:14.540 --> 41:18.500
 is that we learn very fast and faster all the time

41:18.500 --> 41:23.020
 to do more with less, and we've got this.

41:23.020 --> 41:27.820
 And I think, yes, to that idea.

41:27.820 --> 41:32.420
 And I think about it in a fundamental way.

41:32.420 --> 41:36.540
 It's like, I trust Lomborg, I trust Toopy,

41:36.540 --> 41:38.340
 trust Matt Ridley.

41:38.340 --> 41:40.140
 They've thought about these things deeply.

41:40.140 --> 41:40.980
 They're not just saying,

41:40.980 --> 41:42.260
 oh, the environment doesn't matter,

41:42.260 --> 41:44.100
 whatever the environment is.

41:45.180 --> 41:47.540
 You know, the environment, I don't even know what that is.

41:47.540 --> 41:49.660
 That's everything, the environment.

41:49.660 --> 41:51.340
 I'm concerned about the environment.

41:51.340 --> 41:55.380
 It's like, which is, how is that different

41:55.380 --> 41:57.620
 than saying I'm worried about everything?

41:57.620 --> 42:00.780
 How are those statements different semantically?

42:00.780 --> 42:02.820
 Well, yeah, the environment, it could be,

42:02.820 --> 42:04.980
 I'm worried about human society.

42:04.980 --> 42:07.580
 A lot of these complex systems are difficult to talk about

42:07.580 --> 42:09.620
 because there's so much involved for sure.

42:09.620 --> 42:10.940
 Yeah, everything.

42:10.940 --> 42:12.700
 And then these models,

42:12.700 --> 42:14.140
 because people have gone after me

42:14.140 --> 42:15.940
 because I don't buy the climate models.

42:15.940 --> 42:18.220
 Well, I think about the climate models

42:18.220 --> 42:21.380
 as extended into the economic models

42:21.380 --> 42:22.980
 because the climate model is,

42:23.980 --> 42:25.940
 well, there's gonna be a certain degree of heating,

42:25.940 --> 42:27.540
 let's say by 2100.

42:27.540 --> 42:30.900
 It's like, okay, some of that might be human generated.

42:30.900 --> 42:33.700
 Some of it's a consequence of warming after the ice age.

42:33.700 --> 42:36.260
 This has happened before, but fair enough.

42:36.260 --> 42:38.620
 Let's take your presumption.

42:38.620 --> 42:40.780
 Although there are multiple presumptions

42:40.780 --> 42:44.860
 and any error in your model multiplies as time extends,

42:44.860 --> 42:46.740
 but have it your way.

42:46.740 --> 42:48.740
 Okay, now we're gonna extend the climate model,

42:48.740 --> 42:50.860
 so to speak, into the economic model.

42:50.860 --> 42:53.780
 So I just did an analysis of a paper by Deloitte,

42:55.060 --> 42:57.820
 third biggest company in the US,

42:59.140 --> 43:01.940
 300,000 employees, major league consultants.

43:01.940 --> 43:03.740
 They just produced a report in May.

43:03.740 --> 43:05.460
 I wrote an article for it in the Telegraph,

43:05.460 --> 43:08.780
 which I'm gonna release this week on my YouTube channel.

43:08.780 --> 43:12.140
 Said, well, if we get the climate problem

43:12.140 --> 43:14.620
 under control economically,

43:14.620 --> 43:17.140
 because that's where the models are now being generated

43:17.140 --> 43:18.020
 on the economic front.

43:18.020 --> 43:21.380
 So now we have to model the environment, that's climate,

43:21.380 --> 43:23.620
 and we have to model the economy,

43:23.620 --> 43:26.540
 and then we have to model their joint interaction,

43:26.540 --> 43:29.780
 and then we have to predict 100 years into the future,

43:29.780 --> 43:32.660
 and then we have to put a dollar value on that,

43:32.660 --> 43:35.340
 and then we have to claim that we can do that,

43:35.340 --> 43:38.700
 which we can't, and then this is our conclusion.

43:40.340 --> 43:43.820
 We're going to go through a difficult period of privation,

43:43.820 --> 43:45.700
 because if we don't accept limits to growth,

43:45.700 --> 43:47.340
 there's gonna be a catastrophe,

43:47.340 --> 43:49.380
 50 years in the future or thereabouts.

43:49.380 --> 43:52.060
 And so to avert that catastrophe,

43:52.060 --> 43:55.820
 we are going to make people poorer now.

43:55.820 --> 43:56.940
 How much poorer?

43:56.940 --> 43:58.820
 Well, not a lot compared to how much richer

43:58.820 --> 44:01.460
 they're going to be, but definitely,

44:01.460 --> 44:03.100
 and they say this in their own models,

44:03.100 --> 44:06.340
 definitely poorer, definitely poorer

44:06.340 --> 44:09.940
 than they would be if we just left them the hell alone.

44:09.940 --> 44:14.220
 And so then I think, okay, poorer, eh?

44:14.220 --> 44:15.220
 Who?

44:15.220 --> 44:17.140
 Well, let's look at it biologically.

44:17.140 --> 44:22.140
 Got a hierarchy, right, of stability and security.

44:22.900 --> 44:25.020
 That's a hierarchy or one type.

44:25.020 --> 44:27.700
 You stress a hierarchy like that, a social hierarchy.

44:27.700 --> 44:30.660
 So there's birds in an environment,

44:30.660 --> 44:32.420
 and an avian flu comes in,

44:32.420 --> 44:34.540
 and then you look at the birds in the social hierarchy,

44:34.540 --> 44:38.420
 and the low ranking birds have the worst nests.

44:38.420 --> 44:40.580
 So they're most exposed to wind and rain and sun

44:40.580 --> 44:42.780
 and farthest from food supplies

44:42.780 --> 44:44.140
 and most exposed to predators.

44:44.140 --> 44:45.740
 And so those birds are stressed,

44:45.740 --> 44:47.980
 which is what happens to you at the bottom of a hierarchy.

44:47.980 --> 44:51.060
 You're more stressed because your life is more uncertain.

44:51.060 --> 44:51.900
 You're more stressed.

44:51.900 --> 44:53.780
 Your immunological function is compromised

44:53.780 --> 44:55.180
 because of that.

44:55.180 --> 44:57.580
 You're sacrificing the future for the present.

44:58.460 --> 44:59.700
 An avian flu comes in,

44:59.700 --> 45:01.940
 and the birds die from the bottom up.

45:01.940 --> 45:03.620
 That happens in every epidemic.

45:03.620 --> 45:06.380
 You die from the bottom up.

45:06.380 --> 45:10.780
 Okay, so they say when the aristocracy catches a cold,

45:10.780 --> 45:13.020
 the working class dies of pneumonia.

45:13.020 --> 45:15.460
 All right, so now we're gonna make people poorer.

45:16.820 --> 45:18.500
 Okay, who?

45:18.500 --> 45:22.020
 Well, we know who we make poor when we make people poorer.

45:22.020 --> 45:27.020
 We make those who are barely hanging on poorer.

45:27.180 --> 45:28.900
 And what does that mean?

45:28.900 --> 45:30.900
 It means they die.

45:30.900 --> 45:34.420
 And so what the Deloitte consultants are basically saying

45:34.420 --> 45:38.300
 is, well, you know, it's kind of unfortunate,

45:39.180 --> 45:41.700
 but according to our models,

45:41.700 --> 45:44.620
 a lot of poor people are gonna have to die

45:44.620 --> 45:47.340
 so that a lot more poor people don't die in the future.

45:47.340 --> 45:49.460
 It's like, okay, hold on a sec.

45:49.460 --> 45:51.540
 Which of those two things am I supposed to regard

45:51.540 --> 45:52.780
 with certainty?

45:52.780 --> 45:54.340
 The hypothetical poor people

45:54.340 --> 45:57.820
 that you're gonna hypothetically save 100 years from now,

45:57.820 --> 46:00.060
 or the actual poor people

46:00.060 --> 46:04.180
 that you are actually going to kill in the next 10 years?

46:05.140 --> 46:07.980
 Well, I'm gonna cast my lot with the actual poor people

46:07.980 --> 46:09.740
 that you're actually going to kill.

46:11.140 --> 46:13.060
 And so, and then I think further,

46:13.060 --> 46:16.220
 it's like, well, okay, the Deloitte consultants,

46:16.220 --> 46:18.140
 have you actually modeled the world?

46:18.140 --> 46:20.620
 Or is this a big advertising shtick

46:20.620 --> 46:22.620
 designed to attract your corporate clients

46:22.620 --> 46:24.900
 with demonstration that you're so intelligent

46:24.900 --> 46:27.260
 that you can actually model the entire ecosystem

46:27.260 --> 46:30.100
 of the world, including the economic system,

46:30.100 --> 46:32.500
 and predict it 100 years forward?

46:32.500 --> 46:34.220
 And isn't there a bit of a moral hazard

46:34.220 --> 46:36.340
 in making a claim like that?

46:36.340 --> 46:39.180
 Just like just a trifle, especially when...

46:39.180 --> 46:42.100
 So I talked to Bjorn Lomborg and Michael Yon last week.

46:42.100 --> 46:47.100
 I accepted the UN estimates of starvation this coming year.

46:47.100 --> 46:51.380
 150 million people will suffer food insecurity.

46:51.380 --> 46:53.500
 Food insecurity.

46:53.500 --> 46:57.140
 Yeah, food insecurity, that's the bloody buzzword.

46:57.140 --> 46:58.340
 Famine.

46:58.340 --> 47:02.380
 Well, Michael Yon thought 1.2 billion,

47:02.380 --> 47:05.180
 and then that it'll spiral because he said,

47:05.180 --> 47:08.780
 what happens in a famine is that the governments go nuts,

47:08.780 --> 47:12.220
 crazy, the governments destabilize,

47:12.220 --> 47:16.180
 and then they appropriate the food from the farmers.

47:16.180 --> 47:18.380
 Then the farmers don't have any money.

47:18.380 --> 47:20.380
 Then they can't grow crops.

47:20.380 --> 47:22.940
 And I think, yeah, that's exactly what they do.

47:22.940 --> 47:24.980
 That's exactly what would happen.

47:24.980 --> 47:28.060
 And so Yon told me 1.2 billion,

47:28.060 --> 47:30.580
 and then Bjorn Lomborg said the same thing.

47:30.580 --> 47:31.620
 I didn't even ask him.

47:31.620 --> 47:33.740
 He just made it as an offhand comment.

47:35.260 --> 47:36.300
 So...

47:36.300 --> 47:40.220
 Let me ask you about the famine of the 30s.

47:40.220 --> 47:41.060
 Yeah.

47:41.060 --> 47:42.580
 Do you think...

47:42.580 --> 47:43.420
 In the Ukraine?

47:43.420 --> 47:44.260
 In the Ukraine.

47:44.260 --> 47:45.100
 Oh, yeah.

47:45.100 --> 47:45.940
 Fun, fun, fun.

47:45.940 --> 47:48.660
 Similar, a lot of the things you mentioned

47:48.660 --> 47:51.420
 in the last few sentences kind of echo

47:51.420 --> 47:53.820
 to that part of human history.

47:53.820 --> 47:55.660
 The hole in the door.

47:55.660 --> 47:56.500
 Do you...

47:56.500 --> 47:57.340
 No one knows about.

47:58.460 --> 48:01.460
 Well, now I've just spent four weeks in Ukraine.

48:01.460 --> 48:02.300
 Oh, yeah.

48:02.300 --> 48:04.340
 There's different parts of the world that still,

48:04.340 --> 48:07.740
 even if they don't know, they know.

48:07.740 --> 48:08.580
 Yeah, right.

48:08.580 --> 48:09.820
 They feel.

48:09.820 --> 48:12.740
 They feel history runs in the blood.

48:12.740 --> 48:14.980
 The Dutch knew, in some sense.

48:14.980 --> 48:16.820
 They had a famine at the end of World War II.

48:16.820 --> 48:18.460
 And part of the reason the Dutch farmers

48:18.460 --> 48:21.340
 are so unbelievably efficient and productive

48:21.340 --> 48:23.740
 is that the Dutch swore at the end of World War II

48:23.740 --> 48:26.380
 that that was not going to happen again.

48:26.380 --> 48:29.660
 And then they had to scrape land out of the ocean

48:29.660 --> 48:31.260
 because Holland, that's quite a country.

48:31.260 --> 48:32.780
 It shouldn't even exist.

48:32.780 --> 48:35.180
 The fact that it's the world's number two exporter.

48:35.180 --> 48:36.020
 You know that?

48:36.020 --> 48:37.140
 It's the world's number two exporter

48:37.140 --> 48:39.900
 of agricultural products, Holland.

48:39.900 --> 48:43.340
 It's like, I don't think it's as big as Massachusetts.

48:43.340 --> 48:44.620
 It's this little tiny place.

48:44.620 --> 48:46.420
 It shouldn't even exist.

48:46.420 --> 48:49.380
 And they want to put, here's the plan.

48:49.380 --> 48:52.660
 Let's put 30% of the farmers out of business.

48:52.660 --> 48:55.740
 While the broader ecosystem of agricultural production

48:55.740 --> 48:58.420
 in Holland is 6% of their GDP.

48:58.420 --> 49:01.580
 Now these centralizing politicians think,

49:01.580 --> 49:03.480
 tell me if I'm stupid about this.

49:03.480 --> 49:08.480
 Take an industry, you knock it back by fiat by 30%.

49:12.840 --> 49:15.240
 Now it runs on like a 3% profit margin.

49:15.240 --> 49:17.420
 Now you're going to kill 30% of it.

49:18.660 --> 49:20.540
 How are you not going to bring the whole thing down?

49:20.540 --> 49:22.880
 The whole farming ecosystem down?

49:22.880 --> 49:27.140
 How are you not going to impoverish the transport systems?

49:27.140 --> 49:30.740
 How are you not going to demolish the grocery stores?

49:30.740 --> 49:33.720
 You can't take something like that and pare it back

49:33.720 --> 49:37.120
 by fiat by 30% and not kill it.

49:37.120 --> 49:39.400
 I can't see how you can do that.

49:39.400 --> 49:41.960
 I mean, look what we did with the COVID lockdowns.

49:41.960 --> 49:43.880
 We broke the supply chains.

49:43.880 --> 49:45.580
 We tried buying something lately.

49:46.540 --> 49:49.940
 You can't, and wait, and aren't the Chinese threatening

49:49.940 --> 49:50.940
 Taiwan at the moment?

49:50.940 --> 49:52.800
 What are we going to do without chips?

49:53.840 --> 49:56.680
 So I don't know what these people are thinking.

49:56.680 --> 49:58.280
 And then I think, okay, what are they thinking?

49:58.280 --> 49:59.620
 Well, the Deloitte people are thinking,

49:59.620 --> 50:01.420
 aren't we smart and shouldn't we be hired

50:01.420 --> 50:02.920
 by our corporate employers?

50:02.920 --> 50:05.860
 It's like, okay, too bad about the poor.

50:06.760 --> 50:09.700
 What are the environmentalists thinking?

50:09.700 --> 50:11.080
 We love the planet.

50:11.080 --> 50:12.620
 It's like, do you?

50:12.620 --> 50:13.980
 We love the poor.

50:13.980 --> 50:14.820
 Do you?

50:14.820 --> 50:17.080
 Okay, let's pit the planet against the poor.

50:17.080 --> 50:17.920
 Who wins?

50:17.920 --> 50:18.740
 The planet.

50:18.740 --> 50:21.120
 Okay, you don't love the poor that much.

50:21.120 --> 50:24.800
 Do you love the planet or do you hate capitalism?

50:24.800 --> 50:27.200
 Let's pit those two things against each other.

50:27.200 --> 50:29.880
 Oh, well, it turns out we actually hate capitalism.

50:29.880 --> 50:31.460
 How can we tell?

50:31.460 --> 50:33.400
 Because you're willing to break it.

50:33.400 --> 50:34.580
 And you know what's going to happen.

50:34.580 --> 50:35.960
 So what's going to happen in Sri Lanka

50:35.960 --> 50:39.000
 with these 20 million people who now have nothing to eat?

50:39.000 --> 50:40.920
 Are they going to eat all the animals?

50:40.920 --> 50:42.520
 Are they going to burn all the firewood?

50:42.520 --> 50:44.560
 They're stockpiling firewood in Germany.

50:45.560 --> 50:48.320
 It's like, so is your environmental globalist utopia

50:49.280 --> 50:51.720
 going to kill the poor and destroy the planet?

50:51.720 --> 50:54.240
 And that's okay, because we'll wipe out capitalism.

50:54.240 --> 50:55.380
 It's like, okay.

50:55.380 --> 50:57.840
 Yeah, the dragon and the fear of the dragon

50:57.840 --> 51:01.060
 drives ideologies, some of which can build a better world,

51:01.060 --> 51:03.160
 some of which can destroy that world.

51:03.160 --> 51:07.380
 Now, what do you think of that theory about trustworthiness?

51:07.380 --> 51:09.520
 If the dragon that you're facing

51:09.520 --> 51:12.020
 turns you into a terrified tyrant,

51:12.020 --> 51:14.240
 you're not the man for the job.

51:14.240 --> 51:15.540
 Is that a good theory?

51:15.540 --> 51:16.640
 It's an interesting theory.

51:16.640 --> 51:18.440
 Let me use that theory to challenge,

51:18.440 --> 51:20.960
 because what does terror look like?

51:20.960 --> 51:25.420
 Let me table the turns, turn the tables on you.

51:27.140 --> 51:32.140
 You are terrified, afraid, concerned about the dragon

51:37.120 --> 51:41.800
 of something we can call communism, Marxism.

51:43.520 --> 51:45.160
 Am I terrified of it?

51:45.160 --> 51:46.000
 Well, okay, okay.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.040
 I'm not terrified enough to be a tyrant.

51:47.040 --> 51:48.840
 Your theories had two components.

51:48.840 --> 51:49.960
 Yeah?

51:49.960 --> 51:51.240
 I'm not paralyzed.

51:51.240 --> 51:52.080
 Had a dragon.

51:52.080 --> 51:55.280
 Yeah, I'm not paralyzed, and I don't wanna be a tyrant.

51:55.280 --> 51:58.320
 The tyrant part, I think, is missing with you.

51:59.240 --> 52:00.760
 But you are very concerned.

52:00.760 --> 52:02.680
 The intensity of your feeling

52:05.600 --> 52:08.320
 does not give much space,

52:08.320 --> 52:11.000
 actually, at least in your public persona,

52:11.000 --> 52:13.640
 for sitting quietly with the dragon

52:13.640 --> 52:15.160
 and sipping on a couple of beers

52:15.160 --> 52:16.720
 and thinking about this thing.

52:16.720 --> 52:20.440
 The intensity of your anger,

52:20.440 --> 52:24.960
 concern about certain things you're seeing in society,

52:24.960 --> 52:27.080
 is that going to drive you off the path

52:27.080 --> 52:29.440
 that ultimately takes us to a better world?

52:29.440 --> 52:30.760
 That's a good question.

52:30.760 --> 52:33.740
 I mean, I'm trying to get that right.

52:33.740 --> 52:36.440
 So we've kind of come to a cultural conclusion

52:36.440 --> 52:37.520
 about the Nazis.

52:38.520 --> 52:40.800
 Do you get to be angry about the Nazis?

52:40.800 --> 52:42.740
 Seems the answer to that is yes.

52:42.740 --> 52:46.420
 Well, actually, let me push back here.

52:47.720 --> 52:50.760
 I also don't trust people who are angry about the Nazis.

52:51.640 --> 52:53.120
 I mean the actual Nazis.

52:53.120 --> 52:58.120
 Well, as you know, there's a lot of people in the world

53:00.360 --> 53:04.560
 that use actual Nazis to mean a lot of things.

53:04.560 --> 53:05.400
 I know, I know.

53:05.400 --> 53:07.240
 One of them is very important to me.

53:07.240 --> 53:08.400
 Me, for example.

53:08.400 --> 53:09.240
 Well, yes.

53:09.240 --> 53:13.800
 He's a Nazi, or magical super Nazi, as it turns out.

53:13.800 --> 53:15.640
 I think they actually sort of steel man

53:15.640 --> 53:16.840
 all their perspectives.

53:16.840 --> 53:19.920
 I think a lot of people that call you a Nazi mean it.

53:20.920 --> 53:21.760
 Yeah.

53:23.760 --> 53:24.600
 I'm aware of that.

53:24.600 --> 53:26.480
 There's an important thing there though,

53:26.480 --> 53:29.520
 because I went to the front in Ukraine,

53:29.520 --> 53:34.520
 and a lot of the people that lost their home

53:35.080 --> 53:38.480
 or they're kind of, that got to interact a lot

53:38.480 --> 53:40.240
 with the Russian soldiers, the Ukrainian people

53:40.240 --> 53:42.800
 that interact with the Russian soldiers,

53:42.800 --> 53:46.400
 they reported that the Russian soldiers

53:46.400 --> 53:51.400
 really believe they're saving the people of Ukraine

53:52.960 --> 53:55.760
 in these local villages from the Nazis.

53:55.760 --> 53:56.720
 I understand, yeah.

53:56.720 --> 54:00.960
 So to them, it's not just that the Ukrainian government has

54:00.960 --> 54:05.120
 or Ukraine has some Nazis, it's like it has been,

54:05.120 --> 54:08.120
 the idea is that the Nazis have taken over Ukraine

54:08.120 --> 54:09.920
 and we need to free them.

54:09.920 --> 54:11.240
 This is the belief.

54:11.240 --> 54:15.800
 So this, again, Nazi is still a dragon that lives.

54:15.800 --> 54:16.640
 Yeah.

54:16.640 --> 54:18.960
 And it's used by people because it's safe

54:18.960 --> 54:20.400
 to sit next to that dragon

54:20.400 --> 54:22.680
 and spread any kind of ideology you want.

54:22.680 --> 54:27.200
 So I just wanted to kind of say that we have agreed

54:27.200 --> 54:31.840
 on this particular dragon,

54:31.840 --> 54:34.160
 but I still don't trust anybody who uses that one.

54:34.160 --> 54:36.840
 Yeah, but we have issues with boundaries, right?

54:36.840 --> 54:40.680
 No, no, it's, so this is a very complicated problem, right?

54:40.680 --> 54:45.360
 So Rene Girard believed that it was a human proclivity

54:45.360 --> 54:47.780
 to demonize a scapegoat and then drive it out

54:47.780 --> 54:48.620
 of the village.

54:48.620 --> 54:50.760
 And I've thought about that a lot.

54:50.760 --> 54:52.460
 We need a place to put Satan.

54:53.480 --> 54:55.880
 Seriously, this is a serious issue.

54:55.880 --> 54:58.240
 Should he be inside the village or outside?

54:58.240 --> 55:02.040
 Well, maybe he should be inside you, right?

55:02.040 --> 55:05.680
 That's the fundamental essence of the Christian doctrine.

55:05.680 --> 55:08.120
 It's like, Satan is best fought

55:08.120 --> 55:10.960
 on the battleground of your soul.

55:12.560 --> 55:15.180
 And that's, that's right.

55:16.720 --> 55:17.640
 It's right.

55:17.640 --> 55:19.680
 Can you actually put words to the kind of dragon

55:19.680 --> 55:20.520
 that you're fighting?

55:20.520 --> 55:22.440
 Is it communism?

55:22.440 --> 55:24.240
 It's the spirit of Cain.

55:24.240 --> 55:25.080
 Yeah.

55:26.440 --> 55:30.700
 Can you elaborate what the spirit of Cain is?

55:30.700 --> 55:35.700
 So after Adam and Eve are thrown out of paradise

55:36.160 --> 55:37.760
 for becoming self conscious,

55:37.760 --> 55:40.180
 or when they become self conscious,

55:40.180 --> 55:41.720
 they're destined to work.

55:42.640 --> 55:44.560
 And the reason for that, as far as I can tell,

55:44.560 --> 55:47.440
 is that to become self conscious

55:47.440 --> 55:49.520
 is to become aware of the future.

55:49.520 --> 55:51.120
 It's to become aware of death.

55:51.120 --> 55:53.400
 That certainly happens in the Adam and Eve story,

55:53.400 --> 55:56.040
 to have the scales fall from your eyes.

55:56.040 --> 55:58.320
 And then the consequence of that

55:58.320 --> 56:01.400
 is that you now have to labor to prevent

56:01.400 --> 56:03.500
 the catastrophes of the future.

56:03.500 --> 56:04.600
 That's work.

56:04.600 --> 56:06.440
 Work is sacrifice.

56:06.440 --> 56:08.980
 Sacrifice of the present to the future.

56:08.980 --> 56:12.200
 It's delay of gratification, it's maturity.

56:12.200 --> 56:15.200
 It's sacrifice to something as well,

56:15.200 --> 56:17.500
 and in the spirit of something.

56:17.500 --> 56:22.500
 Okay, so now Adam and Eve have two children, Cain and Abel.

56:22.760 --> 56:25.720
 So those are the first two people in history.

56:25.720 --> 56:28.120
 Because the Garden of Eden doesn't count.

56:28.120 --> 56:29.360
 And they're the first two people

56:29.360 --> 56:31.000
 who are born rather than created.

56:31.000 --> 56:32.680
 So they're the first two people.

56:32.680 --> 56:33.800
 And that's a hell of a story,

56:33.800 --> 56:36.720
 because it's a story of fratricidal murder

56:36.720 --> 56:40.640
 that degenerates into genocide, flood, and tyranny.

56:40.640 --> 56:45.640
 So that's fun for the opening salvo of the story, let's say.

56:45.640 --> 56:48.720
 And Abel and Cain both make sacrifices.

56:48.720 --> 56:52.260
 And for some reason, Abel's sacrifice is please God.

56:52.260 --> 56:54.240
 It's not exactly clear why.

56:54.240 --> 56:56.120
 And Cain's don't.

56:56.120 --> 57:00.440
 Now, there's an implication in the text

57:00.440 --> 57:03.480
 that it's because Cain's sacrifices are true,

57:03.480 --> 57:05.000
 are second rate.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.900
 God says that Abel brings the finest

57:07.900 --> 57:09.600
 to the sacrificial altar.

57:09.600 --> 57:11.300
 He doesn't say that about Cain.

57:11.300 --> 57:13.680
 So you could imagine that Cain is sacrificing away,

57:13.680 --> 57:16.360
 but he's holding something in reserve.

57:16.360 --> 57:19.780
 He's not all in, he's not bringing his best to the table.

57:19.780 --> 57:22.120
 He's not offering his best to God.

57:22.120 --> 57:25.620
 And so Abel thrives like mad.

57:25.620 --> 57:26.680
 And everyone loves him.

57:26.680 --> 57:28.720
 And he gets exactly what he needs and wants,

57:28.720 --> 57:30.960
 exactly when he needs and wants it.

57:30.960 --> 57:32.840
 He's favored of God.

57:32.840 --> 57:36.160
 And Cain is bearing this terrible burden forward

57:36.160 --> 57:40.280
 and working, and his sacrifices are rejected.

57:40.280 --> 57:45.280
 So he gets resentful, really resentful.

57:45.480 --> 57:49.280
 Enough resentful enough to call God out

57:49.280 --> 57:51.320
 and say something like,

57:51.320 --> 57:55.680
 this is quite the creation you've got going here.

57:55.680 --> 57:57.320
 I'm breaking myself in half

57:57.320 --> 58:00.200
 and nothing good's coming my way.

58:00.200 --> 58:01.520
 What the hell's up with that?

58:01.520 --> 58:04.900
 And then there's Abel, the sun shining on him every day.

58:04.900 --> 58:06.640
 How dare you?

58:06.640 --> 58:07.920
 It's like, okay.

58:07.920 --> 58:10.280
 But this is God that Cain's talking to.

58:10.280 --> 58:14.640
 And so God says what Cain least wants to hear,

58:14.640 --> 58:17.120
 which is what God usually says to people.

58:17.120 --> 58:21.040
 He says, look to your own devices.

58:21.040 --> 58:24.160
 You're not making the sacrifices you should.

58:24.160 --> 58:25.420
 And you know it.

58:25.420 --> 58:27.800
 And then he says something even worse.

58:27.800 --> 58:31.840
 He says, sin crouches at your door

58:31.840 --> 58:34.620
 like a sexually aroused predatory animal.

58:35.600 --> 58:39.400
 And you've invited it in to have your way,

58:39.400 --> 58:41.560
 to have its way with you.

58:41.560 --> 58:42.920
 And so he basically says,

58:42.920 --> 58:47.600
 you have allowed your resentment to preoccupy yourself.

58:47.600 --> 58:49.400
 And now you're brooding upon it

58:49.400 --> 58:52.880
 and generating something creative, new and awful,

58:52.880 --> 58:55.140
 possessed by the spirit of resentment.

58:56.240 --> 58:59.440
 And that's why you're in the miserable state you're in.

58:59.440 --> 59:03.040
 So then Cain leaves, his countenance falls,

59:03.040 --> 59:04.960
 as you might expect, and Cain leaves.

59:04.960 --> 59:07.840
 And he's so incensed by this because God has said,

59:07.840 --> 59:11.640
 look, your problems are of your own making.

59:11.640 --> 59:13.720
 And not only that, you invited them in.

59:13.720 --> 59:16.480
 And not only that, you engaged in this creatively.

59:16.480 --> 59:18.720
 And not only that, you're blaming it on me.

59:18.720 --> 59:21.160
 And not only that, that's making you jealous of Abel,

59:21.160 --> 59:23.440
 who's your actual idol and goal.

59:23.440 --> 59:28.440
 And Cain, instead of changing, kills Abel, right?

59:29.480 --> 59:31.920
 And then Cain's descendants are the first people

59:31.920 --> 59:34.220
 who make weapons of war.

59:35.400 --> 59:39.320
 And so that's, okay, you wanna know what I think?

59:39.320 --> 59:41.540
 That's the eternal story of mankind.

59:42.480 --> 59:44.440
 And it's playing out right now,

59:44.440 --> 59:47.000
 except at a thousand times the rate.

59:47.000 --> 59:50.080
 Can I present to you a difficult truth?

59:52.320 --> 59:56.180
 Perhaps not a truth, but a thought I have,

59:56.180 --> 59:59.520
 that it is not always easy to know

59:59.520 --> 1:00:01.880
 which among us are the Cain.

1:00:01.880 --> 1:00:03.100
 That's for sure.

1:00:03.100 --> 1:00:08.100
 And resentment, it is possible to imagine you

1:00:10.080 --> 1:00:13.160
 as the person who has a resentment

1:00:13.160 --> 1:00:18.160
 towards a particular worldview that you really worry about.

1:00:19.040 --> 1:00:22.280
 Yeah, well, I talked to a good friend of mine last week

1:00:22.280 --> 1:00:25.080
 about that publicly, we'll release it.

1:00:25.080 --> 1:00:27.720
 So I said, well, do I have a particular animus

1:00:27.720 --> 1:00:30.400
 against the left, let's say?

1:00:30.400 --> 1:00:32.440
 It's like, well, probably.

1:00:32.440 --> 1:00:33.440
 Okay, why?

1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:38.440
 Well, first of all, I'm a university professor.

1:00:38.520 --> 1:00:41.900
 It's not like the universities are threatened by the right.

1:00:41.900 --> 1:00:45.160
 They're threatened by the left, 100%.

1:00:45.160 --> 1:00:47.000
 And they're not just threatened a little bit,

1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:48.660
 they're threatened a lot.

1:00:48.660 --> 1:00:50.400
 And that threat made it impossible

1:00:50.400 --> 1:00:53.080
 for me to continue in my profession the way I was.

1:00:53.080 --> 1:00:55.560
 And it cost me my clinical practice too.

1:00:55.560 --> 1:00:58.760
 And that's not over yet because I have 10 lawsuits

1:00:58.760 --> 1:01:02.220
 against me out right now from the College of Psychologists

1:01:02.220 --> 1:01:05.180
 because they've allowed anyone to complain about me

1:01:05.180 --> 1:01:07.760
 anywhere in the world for any reason,

1:01:07.760 --> 1:01:11.080
 and have the choice to follow that up with an investigation,

1:01:11.080 --> 1:01:14.340
 which is a punishment in and of itself, and are doing so.

1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:19.380
 And then I've been tortured nearly to death multiple times

1:01:19.380 --> 1:01:21.500
 by bad actors on the left.

1:01:21.500 --> 1:01:25.360
 Now I've had my fair share of radical right wingers

1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:27.440
 being unhappy with what I've said,

1:01:27.440 --> 1:01:32.040
 but personally, that's been the left the whole time.

1:01:32.040 --> 1:01:35.660
 Not only me, but my family, put my family at risk

1:01:35.660 --> 1:01:39.460
 in a big way and constantly, like not once or twice,

1:01:39.460 --> 1:01:43.160
 because many people get canceled once or twice.

1:01:43.160 --> 1:01:46.640
 But I've been canceled like 40 times.

1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:49.680
 And I know like 200 people now who've been canceled.

1:01:49.680 --> 1:01:53.160
 And I can tell you without doubt,

1:01:53.160 --> 1:01:56.140
 that it is one of the worst experiences of their life.

1:01:56.140 --> 1:01:58.920
 And that's if it only happens once.

1:01:58.920 --> 1:02:03.920
 And so, and then I also know that the communists killed

1:02:04.600 --> 1:02:07.080
 100 million people in the 20th century,

1:02:07.080 --> 1:02:10.820
 that the intellectuals excused them for it nonstop

1:02:10.820 --> 1:02:14.560
 and still haven't quit, that almost no one knows about it,

1:02:14.560 --> 1:02:17.240
 and that the specter of resentful Marxism

1:02:17.240 --> 1:02:19.000
 is back in full force.

1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:22.120
 And so do I have a bit of an animus against that?

1:02:22.120 --> 1:02:22.960
 Yes.

1:02:22.960 --> 1:02:24.320
 Does it go too far?

1:02:26.400 --> 1:02:27.400
 I don't know.

1:02:27.400 --> 1:02:28.780
 I'm trying to figure that out.

1:02:28.780 --> 1:02:33.580
 The story you just told, it seems nearly impossible

1:02:33.580 --> 1:02:35.880
 for you, an intellectual powerhouse,

1:02:35.880 --> 1:02:38.480
 not to have a tremendous amount of resentment.

1:02:38.480 --> 1:02:39.320
 Well.

1:02:39.320 --> 1:02:41.200
 And this is the, so let me challenge you.

1:02:41.200 --> 1:02:42.040
 Yeah, go right ahead, man.

1:02:42.040 --> 1:02:43.640
 Let me challenge you.

1:02:43.640 --> 1:02:48.640
 Can you steal, man, the case that the prime minister

1:02:50.320 --> 1:02:55.320
 of this country, Trudeau, wants the best for this country

1:02:55.520 --> 1:02:58.840
 and actually might do good things for this country

1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:00.440
 as an intellectual challenge?

1:03:00.440 --> 1:03:01.280
 Sure.

1:03:02.200 --> 1:03:04.400
 He seems to get along well with his wife.

1:03:04.400 --> 1:03:07.040
 He has some kids.

1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:08.680
 There's no sexual scandals.

1:03:08.680 --> 1:03:11.760
 And he's in a position where that could easily be the case.

1:03:11.760 --> 1:03:13.400
 He seems to have done some good things

1:03:13.400 --> 1:03:15.720
 on the oceanic management front.

1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:18.040
 He's put a fair bit of Canada's oceans

1:03:18.040 --> 1:03:19.440
 into marine protected areas,

1:03:19.440 --> 1:03:23.280
 and that might be his most fundamental legacy, if it's real.

1:03:23.280 --> 1:03:24.620
 I've been trying to get information

1:03:24.620 --> 1:03:27.240
 about the actual reality of the protection,

1:03:27.240 --> 1:03:29.080
 and I haven't been able to do that.

1:03:29.080 --> 1:03:30.200
 But that's a good thing.

1:03:30.200 --> 1:03:32.600
 So sorry, the family thing is, there's some aspect of.

1:03:32.600 --> 1:03:33.840
 It speaks to his character.

1:03:33.840 --> 1:03:34.680
 This is a character.

1:03:34.680 --> 1:03:38.240
 There is some aspect to him that makes him a good man

1:03:38.240 --> 1:03:39.080
 in that sense.

1:03:39.080 --> 1:03:41.160
 There's the evidence there.

1:03:41.160 --> 1:03:44.540
 He's not a Jeffrey Epstein profligate on the sexual front,

1:03:44.540 --> 1:03:45.400
 so that's something.

1:03:45.400 --> 1:03:48.920
 And his wife, they seem to have a real marriage,

1:03:48.920 --> 1:03:51.900
 and he has kids, so good for him.

1:03:51.900 --> 1:03:54.160
 That's a good start, by the way, for a leader.

1:03:54.160 --> 1:03:55.000
 Yeah, right.

1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:55.840
 To be a good man.

1:03:55.840 --> 1:03:57.400
 Well, then I also thought, okay,

1:03:57.400 --> 1:04:00.040
 well, after the Liberals had brought in

1:04:00.040 --> 1:04:02.760
 a Harvard intellectual who was a Canadian

1:04:02.760 --> 1:04:06.120
 to be their last leader, he didn't work out,

1:04:06.120 --> 1:04:08.340
 and then they're flailing about for a leader,

1:04:08.340 --> 1:04:10.040
 and the Liberals in Canada are pretty good

1:04:10.040 --> 1:04:14.880
 at maintaining power and leadership,

1:04:14.880 --> 1:04:17.120
 and have been the dominant governing party in Canada

1:04:17.120 --> 1:04:18.600
 for a long time.

1:04:18.600 --> 1:04:21.960
 And so they went to Justin and said,

1:04:21.960 --> 1:04:24.680
 well, you know, it's you or a Conservative,

1:04:24.680 --> 1:04:28.760
 and you can imagine that's not a positive specter

1:04:28.760 --> 1:04:32.120
 for someone who's on the left, or even a Liberal,

1:04:32.120 --> 1:04:35.040
 especially, and Trudeau's quite a bit on the left.

1:04:35.040 --> 1:04:37.360
 And they said, we need you to run.

1:04:37.360 --> 1:04:39.760
 And then I thought, okay, well,

1:04:39.760 --> 1:04:41.720
 the answer to that should have been no,

1:04:41.720 --> 1:04:45.800
 because Trudeau, Justin, has no training for this,

1:04:45.800 --> 1:04:46.640
 no experience.

1:04:46.640 --> 1:04:50.200
 He's not, he's a part time drama teacher, fundamentally.

1:04:50.200 --> 1:04:51.320
 He hadn't run a business.

1:04:51.320 --> 1:04:54.180
 He just didn't know enough to be Prime Minister.

1:04:54.180 --> 1:04:56.540
 But then I'm trying to put myself in his position, eh?

1:04:56.540 --> 1:04:59.880
 So it's like, okay, I don't know enough, but I'm young,

1:04:59.880 --> 1:05:01.840
 and we don't want the Conservatives,

1:05:01.840 --> 1:05:03.520
 and they had had a run, a 10 year run,

1:05:03.520 --> 1:05:05.320
 so maybe it was time for a new government.

1:05:05.320 --> 1:05:08.560
 I could, maybe I could grow into this man.

1:05:08.560 --> 1:05:10.940
 Maybe I could surround myself with good people,

1:05:10.940 --> 1:05:14.200
 and I could learn humbly, and I could become

1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:17.960
 the person I'm now pretending to be,

1:05:17.960 --> 1:05:20.680
 which we all have to do as we move forward, right?

1:05:20.680 --> 1:05:23.460
 And so then I thought, okay,

1:05:23.460 --> 1:05:24.920
 I think you made a mistake there,

1:05:24.920 --> 1:05:28.120
 because you ran only on your father's name,

1:05:28.120 --> 1:05:29.660
 and you didn't have the background,

1:05:29.660 --> 1:05:31.160
 but let's give the devil his due,

1:05:31.160 --> 1:05:33.280
 and say that's no problem.

1:05:33.280 --> 1:05:35.000
 Okay, so now what do you do?

1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:37.880
 Well, you get elected, and your first act is

1:05:38.800 --> 1:05:42.520
 to make the cabinet 50% women,

1:05:42.520 --> 1:05:46.120
 despite the fact that only 25% of the elected members

1:05:46.120 --> 1:05:47.120
 are female.

1:05:47.120 --> 1:05:49.480
 It's like, okay, you just have your talent pool.

1:05:50.580 --> 1:05:53.040
 That was a really bad move for your first move.

1:05:53.040 --> 1:05:55.080
 Can I ask you about that?

1:05:55.080 --> 1:05:58.840
 Do you think, where does that move come from?

1:05:58.840 --> 1:06:00.520
 Deep somewhere in the heart?

1:06:00.520 --> 1:06:05.520
 Or is it trying to listen to the social forces

1:06:05.720 --> 1:06:09.960
 of the moment, and try to ride those ways towards

1:06:09.960 --> 1:06:12.220
 maybe greater and greater popularity?

1:06:12.220 --> 1:06:14.000
 By after thinking it through.

1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:16.860
 It's like, no, you just have your talent pool

1:06:16.860 --> 1:06:18.140
 for cabinet positions.

1:06:18.140 --> 1:06:19.160
 That's what you did.

1:06:19.160 --> 1:06:20.860
 There's enough cabinet positions.

1:06:22.200 --> 1:06:24.320
 You know, you could argue that each of them met threshold.

1:06:24.320 --> 1:06:26.080
 It's like, there's a big difference

1:06:26.080 --> 1:06:27.960
 between threshold and excellent.

1:06:27.960 --> 1:06:31.040
 So you don't think that came from a place of compassion?

1:06:31.040 --> 1:06:31.880
 I don't care if it did.

1:06:31.880 --> 1:06:34.160
 I don't regard compassion as a virtue.

1:06:34.160 --> 1:06:36.400
 Compassion is a reflex, not a virtue.

1:06:36.400 --> 1:06:37.240
 You don't think?

1:06:37.240 --> 1:06:39.280
 Judicious compassion is a virtue.

1:06:39.280 --> 1:06:40.800
 Wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1:06:40.800 --> 1:06:44.640
 Compassion can come deep from the human heart

1:06:44.640 --> 1:06:46.160
 and the human mind, I think.

1:06:46.160 --> 1:06:48.420
 Are we talking about the same kind of compassion?

1:06:48.420 --> 1:06:49.260
 Yes.

1:06:49.260 --> 1:06:50.080
 Trying to understand the suffering in the world.

1:06:50.080 --> 1:06:53.000
 Treating adults like infants is not virtuous.

1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:53.840
 I see.

1:06:53.840 --> 1:06:58.080
 Well, compassion isn't treating adults like infants.

1:06:58.080 --> 1:06:59.560
 I mean, those are just terms.

1:06:59.560 --> 1:07:01.120
 Are you sure?

1:07:01.120 --> 1:07:03.640
 Whatever the term is, maybe love is maybe the better word.

1:07:03.640 --> 1:07:05.540
 Edible compassion is.

1:07:05.540 --> 1:07:08.540
 I mean, I suppose I'm speaking to love.

1:07:08.540 --> 1:07:11.840
 You don't think those ideas came from concern?

1:07:11.840 --> 1:07:16.840
 Love is a blend of compassion and encouragement and truth.

1:07:18.960 --> 1:07:20.520
 Love is complicated, man.

1:07:20.520 --> 1:07:22.160
 Yeah, it has a lot of good things in it, yes.

1:07:22.160 --> 1:07:24.000
 If I love you, is it compassion

1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:25.640
 or encouragement you want from me?

1:07:26.640 --> 1:07:27.480
 Yeah, the dance.

1:07:27.480 --> 1:07:30.640
 Love is definitely a dance of two humans, ultimately,

1:07:30.640 --> 1:07:32.160
 that leads to the growth of both, yes.

1:07:32.160 --> 1:07:33.000
 Well, that's the thing.

1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:34.740
 The growth element is crucial.

1:07:35.720 --> 1:07:38.560
 Because the growth element, to foster the growth element,

1:07:38.560 --> 1:07:40.080
 that requires judgment.

1:07:41.220 --> 1:07:43.840
 Compassion and judgment, well, even,

1:07:43.840 --> 1:07:45.880
 and have been conceptualized this way forever,

1:07:45.880 --> 1:07:48.740
 two hands of God, mercy and justice.

1:07:48.740 --> 1:07:50.880
 They have to operate in tandem, right?

1:07:50.880 --> 1:07:55.880
 And mercy is flawed as you are, you're acceptable.

1:07:58.040 --> 1:07:59.480
 It's like, well, do you want that?

1:07:59.480 --> 1:08:02.060
 Do you want your flaws to be acceptable?

1:08:02.060 --> 1:08:03.320
 And the answer to that is no.

1:08:03.320 --> 1:08:05.240
 It's like, well, that's where the judgment comes in.

1:08:05.240 --> 1:08:07.440
 It's like, but you could be better.

1:08:07.440 --> 1:08:09.280
 You could be more than you are.

1:08:09.280 --> 1:08:11.000
 And that's the maternal and the paternal

1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:12.880
 in some fundamental sense.

1:08:12.880 --> 1:08:17.880
 And there has to be a active exchange of information

1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:20.280
 between those two poles.

1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:23.280
 So even if Trudeau was motivated by compassion,

1:08:23.280 --> 1:08:27.620
 and it's like, yeah, just how loving are you, first of all?

1:08:27.620 --> 1:08:29.080
 No, it was a really bad decision.

1:08:29.080 --> 1:08:32.920
 And then he's expressed contempt for monetary policy.

1:08:32.920 --> 1:08:34.560
 I'm not interested in monetary policy.

1:08:34.560 --> 1:08:39.560
 It's like, okay, but you're a prime minister.

1:08:40.320 --> 1:08:41.800
 And he's expressed admiration

1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:43.920
 for the Chinese Communist Party,

1:08:43.920 --> 1:08:46.200
 because they can be very efficient

1:08:46.200 --> 1:08:48.160
 in their pursuit of environmental goals.

1:08:48.160 --> 1:08:51.580
 It's like, oh yeah, efficiency, eh?

1:08:52.520 --> 1:08:56.140
 The efficiency of the tyranny in the service of your terror.

1:08:57.040 --> 1:08:59.240
 And so, and I've watched him repeatedly

1:08:59.240 --> 1:09:00.700
 and I've listened to him a lot.

1:09:00.700 --> 1:09:03.040
 And I've tried to do that clinically

1:09:03.040 --> 1:09:05.760
 and with some degree of dispassion.

1:09:05.760 --> 1:09:09.800
 And that's hard too, because his father, Pierre,

1:09:09.800 --> 1:09:14.800
 devastated the West in 1982 with the national energy policy.

1:09:15.020 --> 1:09:18.140
 And Trudeau is doing exactly the same thing again.

1:09:18.140 --> 1:09:20.240
 And so as a westerner as well,

1:09:20.240 --> 1:09:24.680
 I have an inbuilt animus and one that's well deserved,

1:09:24.680 --> 1:09:26.600
 because central Canada,

1:09:26.600 --> 1:09:30.320
 especially the glittery literati elite types

1:09:30.320 --> 1:09:34.480
 in the Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto triangle

1:09:34.480 --> 1:09:39.480
 have exploited the West and expressed contempt for the West

1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:42.960
 far too much for far too long.

1:09:42.960 --> 1:09:45.360
 And that's accelerating at the moment, for example,

1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:48.840
 with Trudeau's recent attack on the Canadian farmers.

1:09:48.840 --> 1:09:52.520
 He's an enemy of the oil and gas industry.

1:09:52.520 --> 1:09:54.840
 It's an utter and absolute bloody catastrophe.

1:09:54.840 --> 1:09:56.720
 And look what's happened in Europe,

1:09:56.720 --> 1:09:58.720
 at least in partial consequence.

1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:01.000
 And he's no friend to the farmers.

1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:04.160
 So I've tried to steel man him.

1:10:04.160 --> 1:10:06.620
 I try to put myself in the position of the people

1:10:06.620 --> 1:10:08.340
 that I'm criticizing.

1:10:08.340 --> 1:10:09.940
 I think he's a narcissist.

1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:14.320
 Do you think there's a degree to which power changed him?

1:10:14.320 --> 1:10:17.380
 If you're not suited for the position,

1:10:17.380 --> 1:10:18.780
 if you're not the man for the position,

1:10:18.780 --> 1:10:21.720
 you can be absolutely 100% sure

1:10:21.720 --> 1:10:23.060
 that the power will corrupt you.

1:10:23.060 --> 1:10:24.940
 How could it not?

1:10:24.940 --> 1:10:27.740
 I mean, at the least, if you don't have the chops

1:10:27.740 --> 1:10:30.780
 for the job, you have to devalue the job

1:10:30.780 --> 1:10:34.040
 to the point where you can feel comfortable inhabiting it.

1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:37.900
 So yes, I think that it's corrupted him.

1:10:37.900 --> 1:10:39.980
 And I mean, look at him doubling down.

1:10:39.980 --> 1:10:43.380
 We wear masks in flights into Canada.

1:10:43.380 --> 1:10:46.300
 We have to fill out an arrive can bureaucratic form

1:10:46.300 --> 1:10:49.180
 on our phones because a passport isn't good enough.

1:10:49.180 --> 1:10:50.700
 We can't get a passport.

1:10:51.760 --> 1:10:53.380
 What if you're 85 and you don't know

1:10:53.380 --> 1:10:54.960
 how to use a smartphone?

1:10:54.960 --> 1:10:58.100
 Oh, well, too bad for you.

1:10:58.100 --> 1:11:01.140
 It's like, yes, it's corrupted him.

1:11:01.140 --> 1:11:04.220
 Would you talk to him?

1:11:04.220 --> 1:11:05.980
 If you were to sit down and talk with him

1:11:05.980 --> 1:11:07.620
 and he wanted to talk,

1:11:07.620 --> 1:11:12.620
 would you and what kind of things would you talk about,

1:11:13.460 --> 1:11:14.820
 perhaps on your podcast?

1:11:14.820 --> 1:11:17.820
 I don't think I've ever said no to talking to anyone.

1:11:18.740 --> 1:11:20.020
 So, which is, you know.

1:11:20.020 --> 1:11:22.060
 Would you, would that be a first

1:11:22.060 --> 1:11:24.360
 or would you make that conversation?

1:11:24.360 --> 1:11:27.300
 Do you believe in the power of those kinds of contexts?

1:11:27.300 --> 1:11:30.040
 No, if he was willing to talk to me,

1:11:30.040 --> 1:11:31.720
 I'd talk because I'd like to ask him.

1:11:31.720 --> 1:11:33.480
 I have lots of things I'd like to ask him about.

1:11:33.480 --> 1:11:35.380
 I mean, I've had political types in Canada

1:11:35.380 --> 1:11:37.820
 on my podcast and tried to ask them questions.

1:11:39.060 --> 1:11:40.460
 So, I'd like to know.

1:11:41.820 --> 1:11:44.780
 You know, maybe I've got a big part of him wrong.

1:11:44.780 --> 1:11:49.420
 And I probably do, but my observation has been

1:11:49.420 --> 1:11:51.660
 that every chance he had to retreat

1:11:51.660 --> 1:11:55.460
 from his pharaonic position, let's say, he doubled down.

1:11:55.460 --> 1:12:00.220
 And these, our parliament is not running for the next year.

1:12:01.860 --> 1:12:03.660
 It's still zoom in.

1:12:03.660 --> 1:12:06.180
 It's still COVID lockdown parliament.

1:12:06.180 --> 1:12:11.180
 For the next year, it's already been fatally compromised,

1:12:11.860 --> 1:12:16.860
 perhaps, by the lockdowns for the last couple of years.

1:12:16.900 --> 1:12:19.060
 And this is parliament we're talking about.

1:12:19.060 --> 1:12:24.060
 Yeah, there's a kind of paralysis, fear driven paralysis

1:12:24.700 --> 1:12:27.820
 that also, in part, some of the most brilliant people

1:12:27.820 --> 1:12:29.940
 I know are lost in this paralysis.

1:12:30.780 --> 1:12:32.380
 I don't think people have signed a word to it,

1:12:32.380 --> 1:12:35.500
 but it's almost like a fear of this unknown thing

1:12:35.500 --> 1:12:36.940
 that lurks in the shadows.

1:12:36.940 --> 1:12:41.660
 And that, unfortunately, that fear is leveraged by people

1:12:44.100 --> 1:12:47.140
 that, you know, who are in academic circles,

1:12:47.140 --> 1:12:48.460
 who are in faculty or students,

1:12:48.460 --> 1:12:50.380
 and so on, or more in administration.

1:12:50.380 --> 1:12:52.540
 And they start to use that fear,

1:12:52.540 --> 1:12:55.300
 which makes me quite uncomfortable.

1:12:55.300 --> 1:13:00.060
 It does lend people in the positions of power

1:13:00.060 --> 1:13:02.100
 who are not good at handling that power

1:13:02.100 --> 1:13:07.100
 to become slowly, day by day, a little bit more corrupt.

1:13:07.340 --> 1:13:09.060
 I was really trying to figure out, you know,

1:13:09.060 --> 1:13:10.660
 the last two weeks, thinking this through.

1:13:10.660 --> 1:13:12.060
 It's like, how do you know?

1:13:13.340 --> 1:13:15.020
 Let's say someone asked me a question

1:13:15.020 --> 1:13:16.740
 in the YouTube comments, said,

1:13:16.740 --> 1:13:21.100
 why can I trust your advice on the environmental front?

1:13:22.340 --> 1:13:24.620
 And I thought, that's a really good question.

1:13:25.580 --> 1:13:29.260
 Okay, let's see if we can figure out the principles

1:13:29.260 --> 1:13:31.220
 by which the advice would be trustworthy.

1:13:31.220 --> 1:13:34.500
 Okay, how do you know it's not trustworthy?

1:13:34.500 --> 1:13:39.500
 Well, one potential response to that would be

1:13:40.460 --> 1:13:43.100
 the claims are not in accordance with the facts,

1:13:43.100 --> 1:13:44.820
 but, you know, facts are tricky things

1:13:44.820 --> 1:13:46.380
 and it depends on where you look for them.

1:13:46.380 --> 1:13:49.660
 So that's a tough one to get right because,

1:13:49.660 --> 1:13:51.900
 for example, Lomberg's fundamental critics

1:13:51.900 --> 1:13:56.100
 argue about his facts, not just his interpretation of them.

1:13:56.100 --> 1:13:57.980
 So that can't be an unerring guide.

1:13:57.980 --> 1:14:01.740
 And so I thought, well, the facts exactly doesn't work

1:14:01.740 --> 1:14:05.260
 because when it's about everything, there's too many facts.

1:14:05.260 --> 1:14:08.820
 So then how do you determine if someone's a trustworthy guide

1:14:08.820 --> 1:14:11.420
 in the face of the apocalyptic unknown?

1:14:11.420 --> 1:14:13.380
 Because that's really the question.

1:14:13.380 --> 1:14:17.380
 And the answer is they're not terrified tyrants.

1:14:18.460 --> 1:14:20.540
 I think that's the answer.

1:14:20.540 --> 1:14:21.500
 Now, maybe that's wrong.

1:14:21.500 --> 1:14:22.940
 If someone has a better answer.

1:14:22.940 --> 1:14:24.900
 How do you know if they're a terrified tyrant?

1:14:24.900 --> 1:14:27.900
 Because they are willing to use compulsion on other people.

1:14:27.900 --> 1:14:29.900
 When they could use goodwill.

1:14:29.900 --> 1:14:32.780
 Like the farmers in Canada objected.

1:14:32.780 --> 1:14:36.700
 They said, look, we have every economic reason

1:14:36.700 --> 1:14:39.180
 to use as little fertilizer as we can.

1:14:39.180 --> 1:14:40.780
 Cause it's expensive.

1:14:40.780 --> 1:14:44.900
 We have satellite maps of where we put the fertilizer.

1:14:44.900 --> 1:14:48.020
 We have cut our fertilizer use so substantially

1:14:48.020 --> 1:14:50.100
 in the last 40 years, you can't believe it.

1:14:50.100 --> 1:14:52.260
 And we grow way more food.

1:14:52.260 --> 1:14:54.820
 We're already breaking ourselves in half.

1:14:54.820 --> 1:14:56.180
 And if you know farmers,

1:14:56.180 --> 1:14:57.900
 especially the ones who still survive,

1:14:57.900 --> 1:15:00.540
 you think those people don't know what they're doing.

1:15:00.540 --> 1:15:04.500
 It's like, yeah, they're pretty damn sophisticated man.

1:15:04.500 --> 1:15:08.780
 Like way more sophisticated than our prime minister.

1:15:08.780 --> 1:15:11.860
 And now you tell them, no, it's a 30% reduction.

1:15:11.860 --> 1:15:13.700
 And we don't care how much food you're growing.

1:15:13.700 --> 1:15:18.220
 So it's not a reduction that's dependent

1:15:18.220 --> 1:15:21.740
 on amount of food produced per unit of fertilizer used,

1:15:21.740 --> 1:15:24.500
 which would be at least you could imagine it.

1:15:24.500 --> 1:15:27.180
 So, okay, so you're producing this much food

1:15:27.180 --> 1:15:28.740
 and you use this much fertilizer.

1:15:28.740 --> 1:15:30.660
 So you're hyper efficient.

1:15:30.660 --> 1:15:32.340
 Maybe we take the 10% of farmers

1:15:32.340 --> 1:15:35.060
 who are the least efficient in that metric.

1:15:35.060 --> 1:15:36.140
 And we say to them,

1:15:36.140 --> 1:15:38.740
 you have to get as efficient as the average farmer.

1:15:39.620 --> 1:15:41.220
 And then they say, well, look, you know,

1:15:41.220 --> 1:15:42.780
 our situation's different.

1:15:42.780 --> 1:15:46.100
 We're in a more Northern climb, the soil's weaker.

1:15:46.100 --> 1:15:48.100
 You know, you obviously have to bargain with that,

1:15:48.100 --> 1:15:52.100
 but at least you reward them for their productivity.

1:15:52.100 --> 1:15:55.220
 Well, it's like, well, Holland isn't gonna have beef.

1:15:55.220 --> 1:15:56.940
 Well, where are they gonna get it?

1:15:56.940 --> 1:15:58.140
 Well, you don't need it.

1:15:58.140 --> 1:15:58.980
 It's like, oh, I see.

1:15:58.980 --> 1:16:01.340
 You get to tell me what I can eat now, do you?

1:16:01.340 --> 1:16:02.340
 Really?

1:16:02.340 --> 1:16:03.180
 Okay.

1:16:03.180 --> 1:16:07.660
 And Holland is gonna import food from where

1:16:07.660 --> 1:16:11.340
 that's more efficient on the fertilizer front.

1:16:11.340 --> 1:16:13.460
 There's no one more efficient than Holland.

1:16:13.460 --> 1:16:15.260
 And same with Canada.

1:16:15.260 --> 1:16:19.220
 And like, isn't this gonna make food prices more expensive?

1:16:19.220 --> 1:16:23.020
 And doesn't that mean that hungry people die?

1:16:23.020 --> 1:16:24.700
 Cause that is what it means.

1:16:24.700 --> 1:16:25.540
 And so.

1:16:25.540 --> 1:16:27.700
 Ultimately, poor people pay the price

1:16:27.700 --> 1:16:29.700
 of these kinds of policies.

1:16:29.700 --> 1:16:31.820
 Not known, not ultimately.

1:16:33.700 --> 1:16:34.540
 Now.

1:16:34.540 --> 1:16:35.380
 Today.

1:16:35.380 --> 1:16:36.220
 Today.

1:16:36.220 --> 1:16:37.660
 That's a crucial distinction because they say,

1:16:37.660 --> 1:16:39.660
 well, ultimately the poor will benefit.

1:16:40.980 --> 1:16:42.300
 Yeah, except the dead ones.

1:16:42.300 --> 1:16:43.140
 Yes.

1:16:43.140 --> 1:16:43.980
 Today.

1:16:43.980 --> 1:16:45.340
 Today, right.

1:16:45.340 --> 1:16:48.380
 It seems like the story of war to,

1:16:48.380 --> 1:16:52.620
 is a time when the poor people suffer

1:16:52.620 --> 1:16:56.540
 from the decision made by the powerful, the rich,

1:16:56.540 --> 1:16:59.700
 the political elite.

1:16:59.700 --> 1:17:00.980
 Yeah.

1:17:00.980 --> 1:17:03.340
 Let me ask you about the war in Ukraine.

1:17:03.340 --> 1:17:04.180
 Oh yeah.

1:17:04.180 --> 1:17:06.220
 I got into plenty of trouble about that too.

1:17:07.220 --> 1:17:12.220
 You're, you're just a man in a suit

1:17:12.220 --> 1:17:16.700
 talking on microphones and writing brilliant articles.

1:17:16.700 --> 1:17:20.740
 There's also people dying, fighting.

1:17:20.740 --> 1:17:23.700
 It's their land, it's their country, it's their history.

1:17:23.700 --> 1:17:26.420
 This is true for both Russia and Ukraine.

1:17:26.420 --> 1:17:30.180
 It's people trying to ask, they have many dragons

1:17:30.180 --> 1:17:32.500
 and they're asking themselves a question,

1:17:32.500 --> 1:17:33.660
 who are we?

1:17:33.660 --> 1:17:35.100
 What is this?

1:17:35.100 --> 1:17:37.340
 What is the future of this nation?

1:17:37.340 --> 1:17:41.180
 We thought we are a great nation.

1:17:41.180 --> 1:17:44.180
 And I think both countries say this.

1:17:44.180 --> 1:17:48.940
 And they say, well, how do we become the great nation

1:17:48.940 --> 1:17:50.060
 we thought we are?

1:17:50.060 --> 1:17:50.900
 Yeah.

1:17:50.900 --> 1:17:55.140
 And so what, first of all, you got in trouble.

1:17:55.140 --> 1:17:58.540
 What's the dynamics of the trouble?

1:17:58.540 --> 1:18:01.740
 And is there something you regret saying?

1:18:01.740 --> 1:18:03.660
 No, no, I thought about it a lot.

1:18:03.660 --> 1:18:06.140
 I laid out four reasons for the war.

1:18:06.140 --> 1:18:08.820
 And then I was criticized in the Atlantic

1:18:08.820 --> 1:18:12.020
 for the argument was reduced to one reason,

1:18:12.020 --> 1:18:15.220
 which was a caricature of the reason.

1:18:15.220 --> 1:18:18.220
 I gave a variety of reasons why the war happened.

1:18:18.220 --> 1:18:21.660
 Mismanagement on the part of the West in relationship

1:18:21.660 --> 1:18:24.420
 to Russia and foreign policy over the last,

1:18:24.420 --> 1:18:26.580
 since the wall fell.

1:18:26.580 --> 1:18:30.180
 It's understandable because it's extremely complex.

1:18:30.180 --> 1:18:34.500
 Hyper reliance on Russia as a cardinal source of energy

1:18:34.500 --> 1:18:37.940
 provision for Europe in the wake of idiot environmental

1:18:37.940 --> 1:18:41.740
 globalist utopianism.

1:18:41.740 --> 1:18:46.900
 The expansionist tendencies of Russia

1:18:46.900 --> 1:18:50.300
 that are analogous in some sense to the Soviet Union empire

1:18:50.300 --> 1:18:51.180
 building.

1:18:51.180 --> 1:18:53.940
 And then the last one, which is the one I got in trouble for,

1:18:53.940 --> 1:18:58.540
 which is Putin's belief or willingness

1:18:58.540 --> 1:19:01.180
 to manipulate his people into believing

1:19:01.180 --> 1:19:04.500
 that Russia is a salvific force in the face

1:19:04.500 --> 1:19:06.820
 of idiot Western wokeism.

1:19:06.820 --> 1:19:08.420
 And that's the one I got in trouble for.

1:19:08.420 --> 1:19:10.180
 It's like, while you're justifying Putin,

1:19:10.180 --> 1:19:14.860
 it's like, it's not only the Russians

1:19:14.860 --> 1:19:17.260
 that think the West has lost its mind.

1:19:17.260 --> 1:19:19.340
 The Eastern Europeans think so too.

1:19:19.340 --> 1:19:20.260
 And do I know that?

1:19:20.260 --> 1:19:24.700
 It's like, well, I went to 15 Eastern European countries

1:19:24.700 --> 1:19:26.820
 this spring.

1:19:26.820 --> 1:19:29.900
 And I talked to 300 political and cultural leaders.

1:19:29.900 --> 1:19:32.100
 And you might say, well, they were all conservatives.

1:19:32.100 --> 1:19:35.460
 It's like, actually, no, they weren't.

1:19:35.460 --> 1:19:37.220
 Most of them were conservatives.

1:19:37.220 --> 1:19:38.140
 Because it turns out that they're

1:19:38.140 --> 1:19:39.220
 more willing to talk to me.

1:19:39.220 --> 1:19:42.300
 But a good chunk of them were liberals

1:19:42.300 --> 1:19:46.140
 by any stretch of the imagination.

1:19:46.140 --> 1:19:49.860
 And a fair number of them were canceled progressives.

1:19:49.860 --> 1:19:51.940
 Well, because you're very concerned

1:19:51.940 --> 1:19:55.980
 about the culture wars that perhaps

1:19:55.980 --> 1:20:02.500
 are a signal of a possible bad future for this country

1:20:02.500 --> 1:20:06.340
 and for this part of the world, that reason stands out.

1:20:06.340 --> 1:20:13.380
 And do you, sort of looking back at four reasons,

1:20:13.380 --> 1:20:16.300
 think it deserves to have a place in one of the four?

1:20:16.300 --> 1:20:17.740
 Oh, absolutely.

1:20:17.740 --> 1:20:20.460
 Because it is, you know.

1:20:20.460 --> 1:20:22.180
 Well, the four was bifurcated.

1:20:22.180 --> 1:20:24.300
 Because I said, look, Putin might believe this.

1:20:24.300 --> 1:20:25.780
 And I actually think he does.

1:20:25.780 --> 1:20:27.500
 Because I read a bunch of Putin speeches.

1:20:27.500 --> 1:20:29.820
 And I have been reading them for 15 years.

1:20:29.820 --> 1:20:31.460
 And my sense of people generally,

1:20:31.460 --> 1:20:33.660
 and this was true of Hitler, it's like,

1:20:33.660 --> 1:20:35.620
 what did Hitler believe?

1:20:35.620 --> 1:20:37.900
 Well, did you read what he wrote?

1:20:37.900 --> 1:20:40.020
 He just did what he said he was going to do.

1:20:40.020 --> 1:20:42.380
 And you might think, well, some people are so tricky,

1:20:42.380 --> 1:20:47.140
 they have a whole body of elaborated speech

1:20:47.140 --> 1:20:49.940
 that's completely separate from their personality.

1:20:49.940 --> 1:20:52.860
 And their personality is pursuing a different agenda.

1:20:52.860 --> 1:20:57.180
 And this whole body of speech is nothing but affront.

1:20:57.180 --> 1:21:00.060
 It's like, good luck finding someone that sophisticated.

1:21:00.060 --> 1:21:01.940
 First of all, if you say things long enough,

1:21:01.940 --> 1:21:02.900
 you're going to believe them.

1:21:02.900 --> 1:21:05.260
 That's a really interesting and fascinating and important

1:21:05.260 --> 1:21:05.900
 point.

1:21:05.900 --> 1:21:09.580
 Even if you start out as a lie, as a propaganda,

1:21:09.580 --> 1:21:12.620
 I think Hitler is an example of somebody

1:21:12.620 --> 1:21:14.380
 that I think really quickly you start

1:21:14.380 --> 1:21:16.100
 to believe the propaganda.

1:21:16.100 --> 1:21:19.260
 Well, you've thought a lot about AI systems.

1:21:19.260 --> 1:21:22.740
 It's like, don't you become what you practice?

1:21:22.740 --> 1:21:24.860
 And the answer to that is, well, absolutely.

1:21:24.860 --> 1:21:26.380
 We even know the neurology.

1:21:26.380 --> 1:21:28.420
 It's like when you first formulate a concept,

1:21:28.420 --> 1:21:32.100
 huge swaths of your cortex are lit up, so to speak.

1:21:32.100 --> 1:21:34.820
 But as you practice that, first of all,

1:21:34.820 --> 1:21:36.740
 the right hemisphere stops participating.

1:21:36.740 --> 1:21:40.660
 And then the left participates less and less

1:21:40.660 --> 1:21:43.820
 until you build specialized machinery for exactly

1:21:43.820 --> 1:21:45.780
 that conceptual frame.

1:21:45.780 --> 1:21:49.060
 And then you start to see it, not just think it.

1:21:49.060 --> 1:21:52.300
 And so if you're telling the same lies over and over,

1:21:52.300 --> 1:21:53.620
 who do you think you're fooling?

1:21:53.620 --> 1:21:56.420
 Think, well, I can withstand my own lies,

1:21:56.420 --> 1:21:58.340
 not if they're effective lies.

1:21:58.340 --> 1:22:02.300
 And if they're effective enough to fool millions of people,

1:22:02.300 --> 1:22:04.380
 and then they reflect them back to you,

1:22:04.380 --> 1:22:06.180
 what makes you think you're going

1:22:06.180 --> 1:22:08.140
 to be able to withstand that?

1:22:08.140 --> 1:22:08.940
 You aren't.

1:22:08.940 --> 1:22:12.660
 And so I do think Putin believes, to the degree

1:22:12.660 --> 1:22:15.300
 that he believes anything, I do believe

1:22:15.300 --> 1:22:20.620
 that he thinks of himself as a bulwark for Christendom

1:22:20.620 --> 1:22:23.540
 against the degeneration of the West.

1:22:23.540 --> 1:22:26.620
 And that's that third way that Dugin and Putin

1:22:26.620 --> 1:22:29.340
 have been talking about, the philosopher Alexander Dugin

1:22:29.340 --> 1:22:31.060
 and Putin for 15 years.

1:22:31.060 --> 1:22:34.580
 Now, what that is is very amorphous.

1:22:34.580 --> 1:22:36.580
 Solzhenitsyn thought the Russians

1:22:36.580 --> 1:22:40.900
 would have to return to the incremental development

1:22:40.900 --> 1:22:44.940
 of Orthodox Christianity to escape from the communist trap.

1:22:44.940 --> 1:22:46.860
 And to some degree, that's happened in Russia

1:22:46.860 --> 1:22:49.420
 because there's been a return to Orthodox Christianity.

1:22:49.420 --> 1:22:51.780
 Now, you could say, yeah, but the Orthodox church

1:22:51.780 --> 1:22:53.900
 has just been coopted by the state.

1:22:53.900 --> 1:22:55.980
 And I would say there's some evidence for that.

1:22:55.980 --> 1:23:01.020
 I've heard, for example, that the Metropolitan owns,

1:23:01.020 --> 1:23:03.180
 now I don't know if this is true,

1:23:03.180 --> 1:23:06.300
 owns $5 billion worth of personal property.

1:23:06.300 --> 1:23:09.060
 And I would say there's a bit of a moral hazard in that.

1:23:09.060 --> 1:23:11.660
 And it's possible that the Orthodox church

1:23:11.660 --> 1:23:12.860
 has been coopted.

1:23:12.860 --> 1:23:16.420
 But there has been somewhat of an Orthodox revival in Russia.

1:23:16.420 --> 1:23:18.580
 And I don't think that's all bad.

1:23:18.580 --> 1:23:21.500
 Now, even if Putin doesn't believe any of this,

1:23:21.500 --> 1:23:24.180
 if he's just a psychopathic manipulator,

1:23:24.180 --> 1:23:29.220
 and unfortunately, I don't think that's true.

1:23:29.220 --> 1:23:30.620
 I've read his speeches.

1:23:30.620 --> 1:23:32.460
 It doesn't look like it to me.

1:23:32.460 --> 1:23:34.740
 And he is by no means the worst Russian leader

1:23:34.740 --> 1:23:37.220
 of the last 100 years.

1:23:37.220 --> 1:23:39.340
 Well, there's quite a selection there.

1:23:39.340 --> 1:23:41.500
 There certainly is.

1:23:41.500 --> 1:23:45.380
 And I say that knowing that.

1:23:45.380 --> 1:23:49.860
 Even if he doesn't believe it, he's convinced his people

1:23:49.860 --> 1:23:51.500
 that it's true.

1:23:51.500 --> 1:23:57.260
 And so we're stuck with the claim in either case.

1:23:57.260 --> 1:23:59.860
 And that's the point I was trying to make in the article.

1:23:59.860 --> 1:24:05.740
 Sometimes I'm troubled by people that explain things.

1:24:05.740 --> 1:24:09.260
 And a lot of people have reached out to me, experts,

1:24:09.260 --> 1:24:12.020
 telling me how I should feel, what

1:24:12.020 --> 1:24:14.060
 I should think about Ukraine.

1:24:14.060 --> 1:24:18.340
 Oh, you naive Lex, you're so naive.

1:24:18.340 --> 1:24:20.340
 Here's how it really is.

1:24:20.340 --> 1:24:24.140
 But then I get to see people that lost their home.

1:24:24.140 --> 1:24:27.300
 I get to see people on the Russian side who believe

1:24:27.300 --> 1:24:31.420
 they're, I genuinely think that there's some degree to which

1:24:31.420 --> 1:24:33.500
 they have love in their heart.

1:24:33.500 --> 1:24:38.860
 They see themselves as heroes saving a land from Nazis.

1:24:38.860 --> 1:24:41.420
 How else would you motivate young men to go fight?

1:24:41.420 --> 1:24:47.540
 It's just, it's these humans destroying not only their homes,

1:24:47.540 --> 1:24:50.020
 but creating generational hate, destroying

1:24:50.020 --> 1:24:52.780
 the possibility of love towards each other.

1:24:52.780 --> 1:24:54.700
 They're basically creating hate.

1:24:54.700 --> 1:24:59.540
 What I've heard a lot of is on February 24 of this year,

1:24:59.540 --> 1:25:04.260
 hate was born at a scale that region has not seen.

1:25:04.260 --> 1:25:07.820
 Hate towards not Vladimir Putin, hate towards not

1:25:07.820 --> 1:25:12.980
 the soldiers in Russia, but hate towards all Russians.

1:25:12.980 --> 1:25:15.460
 Hate that will last generations.

1:25:15.460 --> 1:25:23.940
 And then you can see just the pain there.

1:25:23.940 --> 1:25:32.340
 And then when all these experts talk about agriculture,

1:25:32.340 --> 1:25:35.660
 and energy, and geopolitics, and yeah,

1:25:35.660 --> 1:25:39.180
 maybe like what you say with fighting

1:25:39.180 --> 1:25:41.340
 the ideologies of the woke and so on,

1:25:41.340 --> 1:25:45.660
 I just feel like it's missing something deep,

1:25:45.660 --> 1:25:52.500
 that war is not fought about any of those things.

1:25:52.500 --> 1:25:56.900
 War is started, and war is averted based on human beings,

1:25:56.900 --> 1:25:58.860
 based on humanity.

1:25:58.860 --> 1:26:01.260
 Here's another ugly thought, since we

1:26:01.260 --> 1:26:02.580
 haven't had enough so far.

1:26:05.940 --> 1:26:08.780
 We locked everything down for COVID.

1:26:08.780 --> 1:26:10.380
 How much face to face communication

1:26:10.380 --> 1:26:12.940
 was there between the West and Vladimir Putin?

1:26:12.940 --> 1:26:14.420
 How about none?

1:26:14.420 --> 1:26:16.940
 How about that was the wrong amount,

1:26:16.940 --> 1:26:19.820
 especially given that Europe was completely dependent on Putin

1:26:19.820 --> 1:26:21.060
 for its energy supplies?

1:26:21.060 --> 1:26:23.460
 Well, not completely, but you know what I mean.

1:26:23.460 --> 1:26:26.020
 Materially and significantly.

1:26:26.020 --> 1:26:28.620
 Maybe he had to go talk to him once every six months.

1:26:28.620 --> 1:26:30.780
 Maybe he's in a bit of a bubble.

1:26:30.780 --> 1:26:31.660
 Probably.

1:26:31.660 --> 1:26:34.260
 And not just an information bubble,

1:26:34.260 --> 1:26:36.260
 how all these experts tell me about.

1:26:36.260 --> 1:26:39.140
 Yeah, no, a human bubble.

1:26:39.140 --> 1:26:41.220
 Look, one of the things I've really learned,

1:26:41.220 --> 1:26:43.180
 there's a real emphasis on hospitality

1:26:43.180 --> 1:26:45.220
 in the Old Testament.

1:26:45.220 --> 1:26:46.940
 I just brought all these scholars together

1:26:46.940 --> 1:26:48.060
 to talk about Exodus.

1:26:48.060 --> 1:26:50.780
 Hey, I have this security team with me,

1:26:50.780 --> 1:26:53.660
 and they're tough military guys.

1:26:53.660 --> 1:26:57.180
 But they're on board for this mission, let's say.

1:26:57.180 --> 1:26:58.620
 And so they went out of their way

1:26:58.620 --> 1:27:01.380
 to be hospitable to my academic guests.

1:27:01.380 --> 1:27:04.300
 They laid out nice platters of meat and cheese and crackers.

1:27:04.300 --> 1:27:06.300
 They spent all day preparing this house

1:27:06.300 --> 1:27:09.020
 I had rented so that we could have a hospitable time

1:27:09.020 --> 1:27:09.860
 with these scholars.

1:27:09.860 --> 1:27:11.180
 Most of whom I didn't know well,

1:27:11.180 --> 1:27:13.460
 but who said they would come and spend eight days

1:27:13.460 --> 1:27:15.460
 talking about this book with me.

1:27:15.460 --> 1:27:16.740
 We rented some jet skis.

1:27:16.740 --> 1:27:18.060
 We had a nice house.

1:27:18.060 --> 1:27:19.700
 We had fun.

1:27:19.700 --> 1:27:21.420
 And we got to know each other.

1:27:21.420 --> 1:27:22.860
 And we got to trust each other

1:27:22.860 --> 1:27:24.660
 because we could see that we could have some fun

1:27:24.660 --> 1:27:26.420
 and that we could let our hair down a bit.

1:27:26.420 --> 1:27:27.860
 We didn't have to be on guard.

1:27:27.860 --> 1:27:30.780
 And that made the talks way deeper.

1:27:30.780 --> 1:27:33.700
 And then we found out we couldn't get through Exodus

1:27:33.700 --> 1:27:34.540
 in eight days.

1:27:34.540 --> 1:27:37.420
 And so I had proposed very early on

1:27:37.420 --> 1:27:38.780
 that we're gonna double the length.

1:27:38.780 --> 1:27:41.020
 And so I pulled eight people out of their lives

1:27:41.020 --> 1:27:42.860
 for eight days.

1:27:42.860 --> 1:27:44.940
 That's not an easy thing to do.

1:27:44.940 --> 1:27:46.300
 It's also quite expensive.

1:27:46.300 --> 1:27:49.060
 And the Daily Wire Plus people picked all that up.

1:27:49.060 --> 1:27:50.180
 And they said, right.

1:27:50.180 --> 1:27:51.940
 They said, yes, right away.

1:27:51.940 --> 1:27:53.900
 So we'd love to do this again.

1:27:53.900 --> 1:27:54.900
 Well, why?

1:27:54.900 --> 1:27:57.460
 Well, partly because it was intellectually,

1:27:57.460 --> 1:27:58.740
 it was unbelievably engaging.

1:27:58.740 --> 1:27:59.580
 I learned so much.

1:27:59.580 --> 1:28:01.540
 It'll take me like a year to digest it

1:28:01.540 --> 1:28:03.380
 if I can ever digest it.

1:28:04.900 --> 1:28:08.420
 But they had a really good time.

1:28:08.420 --> 1:28:11.020
 And so when they were offered that combination

1:28:11.020 --> 1:28:14.420
 of intellectual challenge, let's say in hospitality,

1:28:14.420 --> 1:28:15.540
 it was a no brainer.

1:28:15.540 --> 1:28:17.660
 They just said, every one of them said,

1:28:17.660 --> 1:28:20.340
 if I can do it in any way, I will definitely be there.

1:28:20.340 --> 1:28:24.100
 And this, I went to Washington a bunch of times

1:28:24.100 --> 1:28:26.900
 and the culture of hospitality has broken down

1:28:26.900 --> 1:28:28.260
 in Washington.

1:28:28.260 --> 1:28:31.620
 40% of congressmen sleep in their offices.

1:28:31.620 --> 1:28:33.140
 They don't have apartments.

1:28:33.140 --> 1:28:35.140
 Their family isn't there with them.

1:28:35.140 --> 1:28:39.700
 They don't have social occasions with their fellow Democrats

1:28:39.700 --> 1:28:43.060
 or Republicans, much less across the table.

1:28:43.060 --> 1:28:46.020
 And so, and I tried to have some meetings in Washington

1:28:46.020 --> 1:28:48.460
 that were bilateral a couple of times,

1:28:48.460 --> 1:28:50.500
 get young Republican congressmen

1:28:50.500 --> 1:28:52.580
 and Democrats together to talk.

1:28:52.580 --> 1:28:54.020
 And as soon as they talk, they think,

1:28:54.020 --> 1:28:55.980
 oh, it was so interesting.

1:28:55.980 --> 1:28:59.180
 Cause one of the lunches was about 15 people,

1:28:59.180 --> 1:29:01.300
 half Democrats and half Republicans.

1:29:01.300 --> 1:29:03.820
 And all I'd asked them to do was just spend three minutes

1:29:03.820 --> 1:29:06.340
 talking about why you decided to become a congressman,

1:29:06.340 --> 1:29:08.460
 which is not a job I would take, by the way.

1:29:09.420 --> 1:29:12.900
 You spend 25 hours a week fundraising on the telephone.

1:29:12.900 --> 1:29:14.860
 Your family isn't there with you.

1:29:14.860 --> 1:29:17.700
 You have to run for reelection every two years.

1:29:17.700 --> 1:29:20.620
 You're beholden to the party apparatus, right?

1:29:20.620 --> 1:29:22.580
 You're vilified constantly.

1:29:22.580 --> 1:29:25.060
 This is not, you know, people think,

1:29:25.060 --> 1:29:26.820
 well, this is a job for the privileged.

1:29:26.820 --> 1:29:29.700
 It's like, yeah, you go and run for Congress

1:29:29.700 --> 1:29:30.940
 and find out how much fun it is

1:29:30.940 --> 1:29:32.100
 and put your family on the line

1:29:32.100 --> 1:29:34.260
 and then have to beg for your job every two years

1:29:34.260 --> 1:29:37.100
 while your enemies, the worst of your enemies

1:29:37.100 --> 1:29:38.420
 and the worst of your friends

1:29:38.420 --> 1:29:41.340
 are viciously hen pecking you.

1:29:41.340 --> 1:29:43.540
 And so anyways, we had them all sit around the table

1:29:43.540 --> 1:29:47.740
 and said, okay, just say why you ran for Congress.

1:29:47.740 --> 1:29:49.500
 It was so cool, especially for a Canadian,

1:29:49.500 --> 1:29:51.700
 cause you Americans, you're so bloody theatrical.

1:29:51.700 --> 1:29:53.140
 It's such something to watch.

1:29:54.260 --> 1:29:56.140
 It was like, Mr. Smith goes to Washington

1:29:56.140 --> 1:29:56.980
 for every one of them.

1:29:56.980 --> 1:29:59.180
 It's like, well, this country has given us so much,

1:29:59.180 --> 1:30:02.140
 where our families have been so,

1:30:02.140 --> 1:30:05.340
 we've benefited so much from our time here.

1:30:05.340 --> 1:30:06.820
 We think this is a wonderful country.

1:30:06.820 --> 1:30:09.220
 We really felt that we should give back.

1:30:09.220 --> 1:30:10.500
 And the next one would talk.

1:30:10.500 --> 1:30:12.220
 And it was like exactly the same story.

1:30:12.220 --> 1:30:13.500
 And then it didn't matter

1:30:13.500 --> 1:30:14.740
 if they were Republican or Democrat,

1:30:14.740 --> 1:30:15.740
 you couldn't tell the difference.

1:30:15.740 --> 1:30:16.900
 No one could.

1:30:16.900 --> 1:30:17.940
 And was it genuine?

1:30:17.940 --> 1:30:20.260
 It's like, well, are you genuine?

1:30:20.260 --> 1:30:22.260
 You think these people are worse than you?

1:30:23.140 --> 1:30:25.260
 First of all, they're not.

1:30:25.260 --> 1:30:27.700
 Second of all, they're probably better.

1:30:27.700 --> 1:30:29.220
 All things considered,

1:30:29.220 --> 1:30:31.780
 it's not that easy to become a Congressman.

1:30:31.780 --> 1:30:34.220
 And I'm sure there's some bad apples in the bunch,

1:30:34.220 --> 1:30:35.660
 but by and large,

1:30:35.660 --> 1:30:37.740
 you walk away from your meetings with these people

1:30:37.740 --> 1:30:42.060
 and you think, pretty impressive.

1:30:42.060 --> 1:30:44.180
 They really are giving a part of themselves

1:30:44.180 --> 1:30:45.540
 in the name of service.

1:30:45.540 --> 1:30:48.180
 Maybe over time, they become cynical

1:30:48.180 --> 1:30:52.780
 and become jaded and worn down by the whole system.

1:30:52.780 --> 1:30:54.140
 But I think a lot of it.

1:30:54.140 --> 1:30:55.620
 Could you imagine that?

1:30:55.620 --> 1:30:58.260
 Is healed, I think.

1:30:58.260 --> 1:31:01.020
 And I don't think I'm, well, I'm in part naive,

1:31:01.020 --> 1:31:02.340
 but not fully,

1:31:02.340 --> 1:31:03.740
 that a lot of it is healed

1:31:03.740 --> 1:31:05.500
 through the power of conversation,

1:31:05.500 --> 1:31:08.180
 just basic social interaction.

1:31:08.180 --> 1:31:11.980
 I do think that the effects of this pandemic.

1:31:11.980 --> 1:31:13.940
 Especially by listening.

1:31:13.940 --> 1:31:15.460
 Listen, just sitting there.

1:31:15.460 --> 1:31:17.980
 And it doesn't have to be talking about the actual issue.

1:31:17.980 --> 1:31:21.620
 It's actually humor and all those kinds of things

1:31:21.620 --> 1:31:23.940
 about personal struggles,

1:31:23.940 --> 1:31:26.260
 all those kinds of things that remind you

1:31:26.260 --> 1:31:29.220
 that you're all just humans.

1:31:29.220 --> 1:31:31.500
 Well, the great leaders that I've met,

1:31:31.500 --> 1:31:32.700
 and I've met some now,

1:31:33.900 --> 1:31:36.100
 they go listen to their constituents.

1:31:36.100 --> 1:31:37.380
 It's not a policy discussion.

1:31:37.380 --> 1:31:38.660
 It's not an ideology discussion.

1:31:38.660 --> 1:31:42.260
 They go say, okay, what's your life like?

1:31:42.260 --> 1:31:43.580
 And what are your problems?

1:31:43.580 --> 1:31:45.740
 And tell me about them.

1:31:45.740 --> 1:31:47.940
 And then they listen and then they're struck by them.

1:31:47.940 --> 1:31:49.700
 And then they gather up all that misery

1:31:49.700 --> 1:31:52.260
 and they bring it to the congressional office

1:31:52.260 --> 1:31:53.180
 or to the parliament.

1:31:53.180 --> 1:31:57.620
 And they think, here's what the people are crying out for.

1:31:57.620 --> 1:32:00.580
 And the good leaders, that's a leader.

1:32:00.580 --> 1:32:02.460
 Leader listens.

1:32:02.460 --> 1:32:06.820
 So I talked to Jimmy Carr about comedy.

1:32:06.820 --> 1:32:11.820
 And he's sold out stages worldwide on a tour, being funny.

1:32:13.140 --> 1:32:14.340
 That's hard.

1:32:14.340 --> 1:32:17.420
 He said, comedy is the most standup comedy,

1:32:18.300 --> 1:32:20.820
 which is what I do in some real sense.

1:32:20.820 --> 1:32:23.420
 It's a thing I do that it's most akin

1:32:23.420 --> 1:32:25.780
 to what I'm doing on my book tours, I would say.

1:32:25.780 --> 1:32:27.420
 It's the closest analog.

1:32:27.420 --> 1:32:29.780
 He said, it's the most dialogical enterprise.

1:32:29.780 --> 1:32:32.340
 And I thought, well, why, what do you mean?

1:32:32.340 --> 1:32:34.180
 Cause see, it's just the monologue.

1:32:34.180 --> 1:32:36.220
 And it's a prepared monologue.

1:32:36.220 --> 1:32:39.860
 I mean, you have to interact dynamically with the audience

1:32:39.860 --> 1:32:40.940
 while you're telling your jokes

1:32:40.940 --> 1:32:42.020
 and you gotta get the timing right,

1:32:42.020 --> 1:32:44.660
 but you have a body of jokes.

1:32:44.660 --> 1:32:47.140
 He said, well, here's how you prepare the jokes.

1:32:47.140 --> 1:32:49.460
 And I've been told this by other comedians.

1:32:49.460 --> 1:32:52.580
 You go to 50 clubs before you go on your tour

1:32:52.580 --> 1:32:55.260
 and you got some new material and you think it's funny.

1:32:55.260 --> 1:32:58.540
 And you go into a club and you lay out your new material

1:32:58.540 --> 1:33:00.500
 and people laugh at some of it.

1:33:01.860 --> 1:33:04.500
 And you pay attention to what they laugh at

1:33:04.500 --> 1:33:06.340
 and what they don't laugh at.

1:33:06.340 --> 1:33:09.020
 So you subject yourself to the judgment of the crowd

1:33:09.020 --> 1:33:11.340
 and you get rid of everything that isn't funny.

1:33:11.340 --> 1:33:14.500
 And if you do that enough, even if you're not that funny,

1:33:14.500 --> 1:33:17.140
 the crowd will tell you what's funny.

1:33:17.140 --> 1:33:20.020
 So you can imagine, imagine you do 50 shows

1:33:20.020 --> 1:33:21.020
 and each is an hour long

1:33:21.020 --> 1:33:24.460
 and you collect two minutes of humor from each show.

1:33:24.460 --> 1:33:27.940
 So you throw away 90, you throw away two hours,

1:33:27.940 --> 1:33:31.820
 more than 98% of it, collect two minutes per show.

1:33:32.780 --> 1:33:34.260
 So you're not very funny at all.

1:33:34.260 --> 1:33:35.860
 You're like funny 2% of the time.

1:33:35.860 --> 1:33:38.860
 You aggregate that, man, you're a scream.

1:33:38.860 --> 1:33:41.420
 So that's what a leader does is,

1:33:41.420 --> 1:33:43.140
 that is what a leader does is goes out

1:33:43.140 --> 1:33:46.900
 and he aggregates the misery, you know, and the hopes.

1:33:46.900 --> 1:33:48.900
 And then I do think that's revivify

1:33:49.900 --> 1:33:52.100
 to someone who would otherwise be cynical and jaded

1:33:52.100 --> 1:33:54.580
 because then the person can say to themselves,

1:33:54.580 --> 1:33:58.700
 despite the inadequacies of the system and my inadequacies,

1:33:58.700 --> 1:34:02.540
 I'm gathering up the misery and the hope

1:34:02.540 --> 1:34:06.540
 and I'm bringing it forward where it can be redressed.

1:34:06.540 --> 1:34:07.580
 Giving it a voice.

1:34:07.580 --> 1:34:09.380
 Yeah, that's right, giving it a voice.

1:34:09.380 --> 1:34:10.860
 Can you actually take me through a day

1:34:10.860 --> 1:34:14.620
 because this is fascinating, through your comedy tour.

1:34:14.620 --> 1:34:19.620
 What does a day in the life of Jordan Peterson look like?

1:34:20.540 --> 1:34:22.500
 Which is this very interesting day.

1:34:22.500 --> 1:34:24.740
 Let's look at the day when you have to speak.

1:34:25.660 --> 1:34:27.180
 Preparing your mind,

1:34:27.180 --> 1:34:30.060
 thinking of what you're going to talk about,

1:34:30.060 --> 1:34:33.660
 preparing yourself physically and mentally

1:34:33.660 --> 1:34:37.260
 to interact with the crowd through the actual speaking,

1:34:37.260 --> 1:34:39.780
 how do you adjust what you're thinking through

1:34:39.780 --> 1:34:41.740
 and how do you come down from that?

1:34:41.740 --> 1:34:46.540
 So you can start all again as a limited biological system.

1:34:47.940 --> 1:34:51.300
 Well, I'm usually up by seven

1:34:52.220 --> 1:34:55.660
 and ready to go by 7.30 or eight.

1:34:56.740 --> 1:34:57.820
 Coffee?

1:34:57.820 --> 1:35:00.460
 No, steak and water.

1:35:00.460 --> 1:35:02.460
 How many times a day steak?

1:35:02.460 --> 1:35:03.780
 All, that's all I eat.

1:35:03.780 --> 1:35:05.060
 How many times?

1:35:05.060 --> 1:35:07.220
 Three or four, depending on the day.

1:35:07.220 --> 1:35:08.060
 Steak and water.

1:35:08.060 --> 1:35:09.500
 Steak and sparkling water.

1:35:09.500 --> 1:35:12.980
 Yeah, so monastic asceticism, man.

1:35:12.980 --> 1:35:16.140
 Well, I did the proper, I usually just once a day,

1:35:16.140 --> 1:35:18.740
 I did the proper Jordan Peterson last night

1:35:18.740 --> 1:35:19.820
 and just ate two steaks.

1:35:19.820 --> 1:35:20.980
 And how was that?

1:35:20.980 --> 1:35:22.380
 It was wonderful.

1:35:22.380 --> 1:35:24.580
 Yeah, well, if you have to only eat one thing,

1:35:25.580 --> 1:35:27.060
 you know, could be worse.

1:35:27.060 --> 1:35:28.940
 So anyways, I'm ready to go at eight

1:35:28.940 --> 1:35:30.460
 because we're generally moving.

1:35:31.380 --> 1:35:32.700
 What does moving mean?

1:35:32.700 --> 1:35:33.900
 Flying. You're constantly.

1:35:33.900 --> 1:35:35.220
 Flying somewhere.

1:35:35.220 --> 1:35:36.060
 Okay.

1:35:36.060 --> 1:35:38.180
 And we usually use private flights now

1:35:38.180 --> 1:35:41.540
 because the commercial airlines aren't reliable enough

1:35:41.540 --> 1:35:44.700
 and you cannot not make a venue, right?

1:35:44.700 --> 1:35:46.500
 So that's rule number one on a tour.

1:35:47.620 --> 1:35:48.860
 You make the show.

1:35:50.380 --> 1:35:52.660
 So everything, and then number rule number two

1:35:52.660 --> 1:35:56.700
 is anybody who causes any trouble on the tour is gone

1:35:56.700 --> 1:35:59.340
 because there is zero room for error.

1:35:59.340 --> 1:36:04.260
 Now, no, there's zero room for unnecessary,

1:36:04.260 --> 1:36:05.260
 unaddressed error.

1:36:05.260 --> 1:36:06.540
 So there's gonna be errors.

1:36:06.540 --> 1:36:10.580
 The guys I have around me now, if they make a mistake,

1:36:10.580 --> 1:36:12.020
 they fix it right away.

1:36:12.020 --> 1:36:13.660
 So, and that's great.

1:36:13.660 --> 1:36:15.780
 There's a lot of people relying on you to be there.

1:36:15.780 --> 1:36:16.620
 So you have to be there.

1:36:16.620 --> 1:36:19.900
 Yeah, like 4,000 people typically.

1:36:19.900 --> 1:36:24.900
 So then I'm on the plane and I usually write or often

1:36:28.180 --> 1:36:31.100
 because there's no internet on the plane

1:36:31.100 --> 1:36:32.500
 and that's a good use of time.

1:36:32.500 --> 1:36:33.740
 So I'm writing a new book.

1:36:33.740 --> 1:36:34.820
 So I write on the plane.

1:36:34.820 --> 1:36:36.220
 Typing or handwriting?

1:36:36.220 --> 1:36:38.940
 Typing, yeah, typing.

1:36:38.940 --> 1:36:43.580
 And then we land and we go to,

1:36:43.580 --> 1:36:47.340
 it's usually early afternoon by then we go to a hotel.

1:36:47.340 --> 1:36:48.780
 It's usually a nice hotel.

1:36:48.780 --> 1:36:49.660
 It's not corporate.

1:36:49.660 --> 1:36:51.460
 I don't really like corporate hotels.

1:36:51.460 --> 1:36:54.700
 My secretary and one of my logistics guys

1:36:54.700 --> 1:36:59.180
 has got quite good at picking kind of adventurous hotels,

1:36:59.180 --> 1:37:01.740
 boutique hotels are usually in the old parts of the city,

1:37:01.740 --> 1:37:03.980
 especially in Europe, somewhere interesting.

1:37:03.980 --> 1:37:08.900
 And so we go there and then lunch usually.

1:37:08.900 --> 1:37:11.620
 And sometimes that's an air fryer and a steak

1:37:11.620 --> 1:37:12.460
 in the hotel room.

1:37:12.460 --> 1:37:14.460
 And I leave a trail of air fryers behind me

1:37:14.460 --> 1:37:15.980
 all across the world.

1:37:15.980 --> 1:37:20.580
 And then Tammy and I usually go out and have a walk

1:37:20.580 --> 1:37:22.540
 or something and take a look at the city.

1:37:22.540 --> 1:37:25.100
 And then I have a rest for like an hour and a half

1:37:25.100 --> 1:37:26.300
 or an hour, half an hour.

1:37:26.300 --> 1:37:27.140
 Like a nap?

1:37:27.140 --> 1:37:27.980
 Yeah, nap.

1:37:27.980 --> 1:37:29.380
 I have to sleep for 20 minutes.

1:37:29.380 --> 1:37:30.420
 And that's about all I can sleep,

1:37:30.420 --> 1:37:31.740
 but I need to do that in the late afternoon.

1:37:31.740 --> 1:37:32.900
 That refreshes your mind.

1:37:32.900 --> 1:37:36.380
 Yeah, that gives me, that wakes me up again for the evening.

1:37:36.380 --> 1:37:38.260
 And then Tam has to sleep longer.

1:37:38.260 --> 1:37:40.140
 She's still recovering from her illness.

1:37:40.140 --> 1:37:42.500
 And so she has to sleep longer in the afternoon

1:37:42.500 --> 1:37:44.380
 and that's absolutely necessary for both of us

1:37:44.380 --> 1:37:46.540
 or things start to get frayed.

1:37:46.540 --> 1:37:48.860
 And so then we go to the venue

1:37:50.100 --> 1:37:54.660
 and then I usually sit for an hour.

1:37:54.660 --> 1:37:56.940
 If I'm gonna lecture, I've been doing a lot of Q and A's

1:37:56.940 --> 1:37:57.860
 and that's a little easier.

1:37:57.860 --> 1:38:01.060
 But if I'm gonna lecture, I have to sit for an hour.

1:38:01.060 --> 1:38:06.060
 And then I think, okay, what question am I trying

1:38:06.460 --> 1:38:07.620
 to investigate?

1:38:07.620 --> 1:38:09.700
 I have to have that, that's the point.

1:38:09.700 --> 1:38:13.140
 What mystery am I trying to unravel?

1:38:13.140 --> 1:38:15.620
 It's usually associated with one of the rules in my book

1:38:15.620 --> 1:38:17.700
 because technically it's a book tour,

1:38:17.700 --> 1:38:21.700
 but each of those rules is an investigation into an ethic.

1:38:21.700 --> 1:38:24.580
 And each of them points to a deeper sort of mystery

1:38:24.580 --> 1:38:25.420
 in some sense.

1:38:25.420 --> 1:38:28.820
 And there's no end to the amount that can be explored.

1:38:28.820 --> 1:38:30.820
 And so I have the question,

1:38:30.820 --> 1:38:35.820
 my question might be something like put your house

1:38:36.020 --> 1:38:38.420
 in perfect order before you criticize the world.

1:38:38.420 --> 1:38:40.740
 Okay, what does that mean exactly?

1:38:40.740 --> 1:38:42.300
 What does house mean?

1:38:42.300 --> 1:38:46.740
 What does put mean, that active verb?

1:38:46.740 --> 1:38:48.940
 What is perfect in order mean?

1:38:48.940 --> 1:38:51.260
 Why before you criticize the world?

1:38:51.260 --> 1:38:52.900
 What does it mean to criticize?

1:38:52.900 --> 1:38:54.660
 What does it mean to criticize the world?

1:38:54.660 --> 1:38:56.820
 How can you do that properly or improperly?

1:38:56.820 --> 1:38:59.300
 So I start to think about how to decompose the question.

1:38:59.300 --> 1:39:02.140
 And you start to think which of these decompositions

1:39:02.140 --> 1:39:03.780
 are important to really dig into?

1:39:03.780 --> 1:39:05.060
 Yeah, well, then they'll strike me.

1:39:05.060 --> 1:39:06.380
 It's like, okay, there's something there

1:39:06.380 --> 1:39:09.060
 that I've been maybe noodling around on

1:39:09.060 --> 1:39:11.140
 that I would like to investigate further.

1:39:11.140 --> 1:39:13.660
 Then I think, okay, how can I approach this problem?

1:39:13.660 --> 1:39:16.220
 I think, well, I have this story that I know,

1:39:16.220 --> 1:39:17.900
 I have this story and I have this story,

1:39:17.900 --> 1:39:19.940
 but I haven't juxtaposed them before.

1:39:19.940 --> 1:39:21.900
 And there's gonna be some interesting interaction

1:39:21.900 --> 1:39:23.420
 in the juxtaposition.

1:39:23.420 --> 1:39:24.780
 So I have the question

1:39:24.780 --> 1:39:27.500
 and I kind of have a framework of interpretation.

1:39:27.500 --> 1:39:31.060
 And then I have some potential narrative places I can go.

1:39:31.060 --> 1:39:33.300
 And then I think, okay, I can go juggle that

1:39:33.300 --> 1:39:35.100
 and see what happens.

1:39:35.100 --> 1:39:38.820
 And so then what I wanna do is concentrate on that process

1:39:38.820 --> 1:39:40.340
 while attending to the audience

1:39:40.340 --> 1:39:42.500
 to make sure that the words are landing

1:39:42.500 --> 1:39:45.020
 and then see if I can delve into it deeply enough

1:39:45.020 --> 1:39:50.020
 so that a narrative emerges spontaneously with an ending.

1:39:50.620 --> 1:39:53.420
 Now, I'm sure you've experienced this in podcasts, right?

1:39:53.420 --> 1:39:56.100
 Maybe I'm wrong, but my experience has been

1:39:56.100 --> 1:39:58.380
 if I fall into the conversation

1:39:58.380 --> 1:40:00.780
 and we know about the timeframe,

1:40:00.780 --> 1:40:03.620
 there'll be a natural narrative arc.

1:40:03.620 --> 1:40:06.140
 And then, so you'll kind of know when the midpoint is

1:40:06.140 --> 1:40:08.020
 and you'll kind of see when you're reaching a conclusion.

1:40:08.020 --> 1:40:09.340
 And then if you really pay attention,

1:40:09.340 --> 1:40:12.020
 you can see that's a good place to stop.

1:40:12.900 --> 1:40:15.300
 And it's kind of, you come to a point

1:40:15.300 --> 1:40:20.180
 and you have to be alert and patient to see that.

1:40:20.180 --> 1:40:22.300
 And you have to be willing to be satisfied

1:40:22.300 --> 1:40:24.140
 with where you've got to.

1:40:24.140 --> 1:40:26.660
 But if you do that, and then it's like a comedian

1:40:26.660 --> 1:40:28.700
 making the punchline work.

1:40:28.700 --> 1:40:32.220
 It's like, I've got all these balls in the air

1:40:32.220 --> 1:40:33.820
 and they're going somewhere

1:40:33.820 --> 1:40:36.380
 and this is how they come together.

1:40:36.380 --> 1:40:37.660
 And people love that, right?

1:40:37.660 --> 1:40:40.100
 They say, oh, this and this and this and this and this.

1:40:40.100 --> 1:40:42.660
 Whack, together.

1:40:42.660 --> 1:40:43.620
 And that's an insight.

1:40:43.620 --> 1:40:45.980
 And it is very much like a punchline.

1:40:45.980 --> 1:40:48.260
 Well, that's interesting because your mind actually,

1:40:48.260 --> 1:40:49.860
 so I'm a fan of your podcast too.

1:40:49.860 --> 1:40:53.380
 And you are always driving towards that.

1:40:53.380 --> 1:40:57.060
 I would say for me in a podcast conversation,

1:40:57.060 --> 1:41:00.700
 there's often a kind of Alice in Wonderland

1:41:00.700 --> 1:41:02.260
 type of exploration.

1:41:02.260 --> 1:41:03.540
 Down the rabbit hole, man.

1:41:03.540 --> 1:41:06.180
 And then you just, a new thing pops up,

1:41:06.180 --> 1:41:08.820
 the more absurd, the wilder, the better.

1:41:08.820 --> 1:41:10.860
 Conversations with Elon are like this.

1:41:10.860 --> 1:41:14.180
 It's like, actually the more you drive towards an arc,

1:41:14.180 --> 1:41:16.300
 the more uncomfortable you start to get

1:41:16.300 --> 1:41:19.740
 in a fun, absurd conversation because,

1:41:19.740 --> 1:41:22.420
 oh, I'm now one of the normies.

1:41:22.420 --> 1:41:23.460
 No, I don't want that.

1:41:23.460 --> 1:41:25.700
 I wanna be, I want the rabbit.

1:41:25.700 --> 1:41:29.740
 I want the crazy because it makes it more fun.

1:41:29.740 --> 1:41:33.740
 But somehow throughout it, there is wisdom

1:41:33.740 --> 1:41:37.500
 that you try to grasp at such that there is a thread.

1:41:37.500 --> 1:41:38.580
 Well, that's the thing, man.

1:41:38.580 --> 1:41:40.340
 You're following the thread, eh?

1:41:40.340 --> 1:41:42.940
 Yeah, the thread's the, well, that's right.

1:41:42.940 --> 1:41:45.500
 That's what we're trying to do, that thread.

1:41:45.500 --> 1:41:47.220
 That thread is the proper balance

1:41:47.220 --> 1:41:49.100
 between structure and spontaneity.

1:41:49.100 --> 1:41:52.180
 And it manifests itself as the instinct of meaning.

1:41:52.180 --> 1:41:54.740
 And that's the logos in the dialogos.

1:41:54.740 --> 1:41:55.980
 And it really is the logos.

1:41:55.980 --> 1:41:57.740
 And God only knows what that means.

1:41:58.620 --> 1:42:00.380
 You know, I mean, the biblical claim

1:42:00.380 --> 1:42:03.740
 is that logos is the fundamental principle of reality.

1:42:03.740 --> 1:42:05.700
 And I think that's true.

1:42:05.700 --> 1:42:07.900
 I actually think that's true

1:42:07.900 --> 1:42:10.580
 because I think that that meaning that guides you,

1:42:10.580 --> 1:42:11.820
 well, here's a way of thinking about it.

1:42:11.820 --> 1:42:14.220
 I've been writing about this recently.

1:42:14.220 --> 1:42:17.100
 What's real matter?

1:42:17.100 --> 1:42:19.220
 It's like, okay, that's one answer.

1:42:19.220 --> 1:42:20.100
 What's real?

1:42:20.100 --> 1:42:22.180
 What matters is real.

1:42:22.180 --> 1:42:24.020
 Because that's how you act.

1:42:24.020 --> 1:42:25.900
 Okay, so that's different than matter.

1:42:26.900 --> 1:42:30.740
 It's like, okay, what's the most real of what matters?

1:42:31.900 --> 1:42:32.820
 How about pain?

1:42:33.700 --> 1:42:35.500
 Why is it the most real?

1:42:35.500 --> 1:42:37.060
 Try arguing it away.

1:42:38.380 --> 1:42:39.220
 Good luck.

1:42:40.220 --> 1:42:43.100
 So pain is the fundamental reality.

1:42:43.100 --> 1:42:43.940
 All right.

1:42:44.940 --> 1:42:46.860
 Well, that's rough.

1:42:46.860 --> 1:42:50.220
 Doesn't that lead to nihilism and hopelessness?

1:42:50.220 --> 1:42:53.780
 Yeah, doesn't it lead to a philosophy

1:42:53.780 --> 1:42:55.780
 that's antithetical towards being

1:42:55.780 --> 1:42:58.700
 the most fundamental reality is pain?

1:42:58.700 --> 1:42:59.740
 Yes.

1:42:59.740 --> 1:43:01.940
 Is there anything more fundamental than pain?

1:43:03.620 --> 1:43:04.460
 Love.

1:43:06.500 --> 1:43:07.340
 Really?

1:43:08.300 --> 1:43:09.420
 If you're in pain,

1:43:13.780 --> 1:43:14.900
 love and truth,

1:43:14.900 --> 1:43:17.100
 that's what you got.

1:43:17.100 --> 1:43:18.940
 And you know,

1:43:24.020 --> 1:43:26.700
 if they're more powerful than pain,

1:43:26.700 --> 1:43:28.500
 maybe they're the most real things.

1:43:31.580 --> 1:43:33.580
 When you think about reality, what is real?

1:43:33.580 --> 1:43:36.100
 That is the most real thing.

1:43:36.100 --> 1:43:37.460
 Well, it's a tough one, right?

1:43:37.460 --> 1:43:39.060
 Because you have to,

1:43:39.060 --> 1:43:41.020
 because if you're a scientist, a materialist,

1:43:41.020 --> 1:43:44.940
 think, well, the matter is the most real.

1:43:44.940 --> 1:43:47.460
 It's like, well, you don't know what the matter is.

1:43:47.460 --> 1:43:48.300
 Yeah.

1:43:48.300 --> 1:43:49.700
 And so, and then when push comes to shove,

1:43:49.700 --> 1:43:53.020
 and it will, you'll find out what's most real.

1:43:53.020 --> 1:43:53.860
 Yeah.

1:43:54.860 --> 1:43:59.180
 I feel like this is missing,

1:43:59.180 --> 1:44:03.460
 the physical reality is missing some of the things.

1:44:03.460 --> 1:44:05.940
 So of course pain has a biological component

1:44:05.940 --> 1:44:06.820
 and all those kinds of things,

1:44:06.820 --> 1:44:10.620
 but it's missing something deep about the human condition

1:44:10.620 --> 1:44:15.220
 that at least the modern science is not able to describe,

1:44:15.220 --> 1:44:17.220
 but it is reaching towards that.

1:44:17.220 --> 1:44:18.060
 Yeah, it is.

1:44:18.060 --> 1:44:21.060
 And it's the reason, one way to describe it

1:44:21.060 --> 1:44:23.660
 as you're describing is the reason it's reaching it

1:44:23.660 --> 1:44:27.340
 is because underneath of science is this assumption

1:44:27.340 --> 1:44:29.420
 that there's a deep.

1:44:30.460 --> 1:44:31.940
 Logos.

1:44:31.940 --> 1:44:34.740
 Thing to this whole thing we're trying to do.

1:44:34.740 --> 1:44:36.540
 Well, you know, there's two traditions, right?

1:44:36.540 --> 1:44:39.500
 In some sense, there's two logos traditions.

1:44:39.500 --> 1:44:44.300
 There's the Greek rational enlightenment tradition.

1:44:44.300 --> 1:44:45.780
 That's a logos tradition.

1:44:45.780 --> 1:44:48.420
 And it insists that there's a logos in nature

1:44:48.420 --> 1:44:50.620
 and that science is the way to approach it.

1:44:50.620 --> 1:44:52.500
 And then there's a Judeo Christian logos,

1:44:52.500 --> 1:44:55.060
 which is more embodied and more spiritual.

1:44:55.060 --> 1:44:57.140
 And I would say the West is actually an attempt

1:44:57.140 --> 1:44:59.020
 to unite those two.

1:44:59.020 --> 1:45:01.580
 And it's the proper attempt to unite those two

1:45:02.540 --> 1:45:04.860
 because they need to be united.

1:45:04.860 --> 1:45:07.460
 And I see the union coming in your terms.

1:45:07.460 --> 1:45:09.700
 You know, I talked to friends to wall, for example

1:45:09.700 --> 1:45:13.380
 about the animating principle of chimpanzee sovereignty.

1:45:13.380 --> 1:45:15.260
 And that's pretty close biologically.

1:45:15.260 --> 1:45:16.820
 Is it power?

1:45:16.820 --> 1:45:19.380
 Cause that's the claim even from the biologists often

1:45:19.380 --> 1:45:23.660
 the most dominant chimp has the best reproductive success.

1:45:23.660 --> 1:45:26.140
 It's like, oh yeah, dominant.

1:45:26.140 --> 1:45:28.340
 Hey, you mean using compulsion?

1:45:28.340 --> 1:45:29.940
 Okay, let's look.

1:45:29.940 --> 1:45:34.620
 Are the chimps who use compulsion the most successful?

1:45:34.620 --> 1:45:39.100
 And the answer is sporadically and rarely.

1:45:39.100 --> 1:45:41.460
 And for short, well, that's sporadically

1:45:41.460 --> 1:45:43.020
 for short periods of time.

1:45:43.020 --> 1:45:44.100
 Why?

1:45:44.100 --> 1:45:46.660
 Because they meet an unpleasant end.

1:45:47.780 --> 1:45:52.420
 The subordinates over whom they exercise arbitrary control

1:45:52.420 --> 1:45:56.940
 wait for a weak moment and then tear them into shreds, right?

1:45:56.940 --> 1:46:00.540
 Every dictators terror and for good reason.

1:46:00.540 --> 1:46:03.020
 And the wall has showed that the alpha chimps,

1:46:03.020 --> 1:46:07.340
 the males who do have preferential mating access often

1:46:07.340 --> 1:46:12.060
 are often and reliably the best peacemakers

1:46:12.060 --> 1:46:14.140
 and the most reciprocal.

1:46:14.140 --> 1:46:16.620
 And so even among chimps, the principle of sovereignty

1:46:16.620 --> 1:46:21.620
 is something like iterative, iterated reciprocity.

1:46:23.020 --> 1:46:26.860
 And that's a way better principle than power.

1:46:26.860 --> 1:46:28.740
 And it's something like I've been thinking

1:46:28.740 --> 1:46:31.620
 what's the antithesis of the spirit of power.

1:46:31.620 --> 1:46:33.500
 I think it's the spirit of play.

1:46:35.340 --> 1:46:37.460
 And I don't know what you think about that,

1:46:37.460 --> 1:46:39.620
 but when you have a good podcast conversation,

1:46:39.620 --> 1:46:41.900
 you already described it in some sense as play.

1:46:41.900 --> 1:46:43.420
 It's like, there's a structure, right?

1:46:43.420 --> 1:46:45.940
 Cause it's an ordered conversation,

1:46:45.940 --> 1:46:48.140
 but you want there to be play in the system.

1:46:48.140 --> 1:46:51.340
 And if you get that right, then it's really engaging.

1:46:51.340 --> 1:46:54.860
 And then it seems to have its own narrative arc.

1:46:54.860 --> 1:46:56.780
 I'm not trying to impose that even though

1:46:56.780 --> 1:46:58.140
 that's another thing I don't do.

1:46:58.140 --> 1:47:01.300
 I didn't come to this conversation at all thinking,

1:47:01.300 --> 1:47:03.220
 here's what I want out of a conversation

1:47:03.220 --> 1:47:06.020
 with Lex Friedman, like instrumentally.

1:47:06.020 --> 1:47:08.860
 I thought, I'll go talk to Lex.

1:47:08.860 --> 1:47:09.700
 Why?

1:47:10.860 --> 1:47:13.140
 I like his podcasts.

1:47:13.140 --> 1:47:14.500
 He's doing something right.

1:47:14.500 --> 1:47:15.820
 I don't know what it is.

1:47:15.820 --> 1:47:17.940
 He asks interesting questions.

1:47:17.940 --> 1:47:19.780
 I'll go have a conversation with him.

1:47:19.780 --> 1:47:20.900
 Where's it gonna go?

1:47:22.180 --> 1:47:23.460
 Wherever it goes.

1:47:24.420 --> 1:47:26.340
 Embracing the spirit of play.

1:47:26.340 --> 1:47:30.020
 So what you have this, when you're lecturing,

1:47:30.020 --> 1:47:32.060
 you're going in front of the crowd,

1:47:32.060 --> 1:47:36.380
 you thought of a question, you get on the stage.

1:47:36.380 --> 1:47:38.300
 First of all, are you nervous at all?

1:47:39.580 --> 1:47:43.060
 I'm very nervous when I'm sitting down,

1:47:43.060 --> 1:47:46.060
 thinking through the structure initially,

1:47:46.060 --> 1:47:49.020
 which is why my wife and I have been doing Q and As

1:47:49.020 --> 1:47:50.820
 and that's easier on me.

1:47:50.820 --> 1:47:54.460
 It's the way comedians are nervous.

1:47:54.460 --> 1:47:59.180
 Like Joe Rogan just did his special this weekend.

1:47:59.180 --> 1:48:03.820
 And so he now has to sit nervously like a comedian does,

1:48:03.820 --> 1:48:07.020
 which is like, I have no material now.

1:48:07.020 --> 1:48:07.860
 Right.

1:48:07.860 --> 1:48:08.700
 I have to start from scratch.

1:48:08.700 --> 1:48:10.780
 When I was doing the lectures constantly

1:48:10.780 --> 1:48:13.420
 instead of the Q and As,

1:48:13.420 --> 1:48:15.340
 basically what I was doing was writing

1:48:15.340 --> 1:48:16.940
 a whole book chapter every night.

1:48:17.820 --> 1:48:20.300
 And now that's a bit of an exaggeration

1:48:20.300 --> 1:48:22.660
 because I would return to themes that I had developed,

1:48:22.660 --> 1:48:24.500
 but it's not really an exaggeration

1:48:24.500 --> 1:48:29.500
 because I didn't ever just go over wrote material ever.

1:48:30.220 --> 1:48:34.540
 So it's very demanding and that part's nerve wracking

1:48:34.540 --> 1:48:36.420
 because I sit down, it's an hour before the show

1:48:36.420 --> 1:48:41.020
 and I think, can I do this?

1:48:41.020 --> 1:48:45.020
 And the answer is, well, you did it a thousand times,

1:48:45.020 --> 1:48:46.900
 but that's not this time.

1:48:46.900 --> 1:48:49.140
 It's like, can I come up with a question?

1:48:49.140 --> 1:48:51.260
 Can I think through the structure?

1:48:51.260 --> 1:48:56.140
 Can I pull off the spontaneous narrative?

1:48:56.140 --> 1:48:57.420
 Can I pull it together?

1:48:57.420 --> 1:49:00.060
 And the answer is, I don't know.

1:49:00.060 --> 1:49:02.660
 And so then I get it together in my mind, I think,

1:49:02.660 --> 1:49:03.500
 and that's hard.

1:49:03.500 --> 1:49:05.780
 It takes effort and it's nerve wracking.

1:49:06.820 --> 1:49:07.700
 Okay, I got it.

1:49:07.700 --> 1:49:09.660
 But then there's the moment you go out on stage

1:49:09.660 --> 1:49:13.420
 and you think, well, I know I had it, but can I do it?

1:49:13.420 --> 1:49:15.140
 No notes.

1:49:15.140 --> 1:49:16.340
 And then the question is,

1:49:16.340 --> 1:49:18.860
 well, you're gonna find out while you do it.

1:49:18.860 --> 1:49:22.860
 And so then I go out on stage and I don't talk

1:49:22.860 --> 1:49:26.620
 to the audience, I talk to one person at a time.

1:49:27.740 --> 1:49:29.580
 And you can talk to one person,

1:49:29.580 --> 1:49:30.540
 cause you know how to do that.

1:49:30.540 --> 1:49:32.420
 So I talk to a person and not too long

1:49:32.420 --> 1:49:33.860
 cause I don't wanna make them too nervous

1:49:33.860 --> 1:49:35.940
 and then someone else and someone else.

1:49:35.940 --> 1:49:37.980
 And then I'm in contact with the audience

1:49:37.980 --> 1:49:41.100
 and then I can tell if the words are landing

1:49:41.100 --> 1:49:43.540
 and I listen, it's like, are they rustling around?

1:49:44.580 --> 1:49:46.100
 Are they dead quiet?

1:49:46.100 --> 1:49:47.660
 Cause you want dead quiet.

1:49:47.660 --> 1:49:49.380
 You're, oh, I see.

1:49:49.380 --> 1:49:52.060
 That's what focus sounds like.

1:49:52.060 --> 1:49:53.460
 You're in it together then.

1:49:53.460 --> 1:49:54.300
 You bet.

1:49:54.300 --> 1:49:55.660
 Well, and I also, here's a good rule

1:49:55.660 --> 1:49:57.700
 if you're learning to speak publicly,

1:49:57.700 --> 1:50:02.700
 I never say a word till everyone is 100% quiet.

1:50:04.580 --> 1:50:06.660
 And that's, it's a great way to start a talk

1:50:06.660 --> 1:50:08.940
 because you're setting the frame,

1:50:08.940 --> 1:50:11.580
 and if the frame is we'll all talk while you're talking,

1:50:11.580 --> 1:50:14.420
 the message is, well, you can talk.

1:50:14.420 --> 1:50:16.220
 This is a place where everybody can talk.

1:50:16.220 --> 1:50:17.900
 It's like, no, it's not.

1:50:17.900 --> 1:50:21.180
 This is a place where people paid to hear me talk.

1:50:21.180 --> 1:50:24.020
 So I'm not gonna talk till everyone's listening.

1:50:24.020 --> 1:50:26.980
 And so then you get that stillness

1:50:26.980 --> 1:50:28.180
 and then you just wait

1:50:28.180 --> 1:50:30.820
 cause that stillness turns into an expectation.

1:50:30.820 --> 1:50:34.420
 And then it comes, turns into a kind of nervous expectations

1:50:34.420 --> 1:50:35.940
 like what the hell is he doing?

1:50:35.940 --> 1:50:37.140
 It's not manipulative.

1:50:37.140 --> 1:50:38.740
 It's a sense of timing.

1:50:38.740 --> 1:50:40.420
 It's like just when that's right,

1:50:40.420 --> 1:50:42.940
 you think, okay, now it's time to start.

1:50:42.940 --> 1:50:46.220
 Well, the interesting thing about that nervous expectation

1:50:46.220 --> 1:50:49.380
 is from an audience perspective, we're in it together.

1:50:49.380 --> 1:50:50.220
 Yeah.

1:50:50.220 --> 1:50:51.580
 I mean, there is into that silence,

1:50:51.580 --> 1:50:53.100
 there's a togetherness to it.

1:50:53.100 --> 1:50:55.420
 Of course, it's the union of everyone's attention.

1:50:55.420 --> 1:50:56.260
 Yeah.

1:50:56.260 --> 1:50:58.460
 Yeah, and that's a great thing.

1:50:58.460 --> 1:51:00.740
 I mean, you love that at a concert when everyone,

1:51:00.740 --> 1:51:01.740
 it's not silence then,

1:51:01.740 --> 1:51:03.940
 but when everyone's attention is unified

1:51:03.940 --> 1:51:05.260
 and everyone's moving in unison,

1:51:05.260 --> 1:51:09.340
 it's like we're all worshiping the same thing, right?

1:51:09.340 --> 1:51:11.500
 And that would be the point of the conversation,

1:51:11.500 --> 1:51:13.700
 the point of the lecture.

1:51:13.700 --> 1:51:16.660
 And the worship is the direction of attention towards it.

1:51:16.660 --> 1:51:18.260
 And it's union, it's communion

1:51:18.260 --> 1:51:20.660
 because everyone's doing it at the same time.

1:51:20.660 --> 1:51:23.300
 And so, I mean, there's not much difference

1:51:23.300 --> 1:51:25.700
 between a lecture theater and a church in that regard, right?

1:51:25.700 --> 1:51:28.460
 It's the same fundamental layout and structure.

1:51:28.460 --> 1:51:30.980
 And they're very integrally associated with one another.

1:51:30.980 --> 1:51:32.260
 One really grew out of the other,

1:51:32.260 --> 1:51:34.380
 the lecture theater grew out of the church.

1:51:34.380 --> 1:51:36.340
 So it's perfectly reasonable

1:51:36.340 --> 1:51:38.580
 to be thinking about it in those terms.

1:51:38.580 --> 1:51:42.180
 And so, and then, okay, so after the lecture,

1:51:42.180 --> 1:51:45.580
 we play a piece of music that is a piece of music

1:51:45.580 --> 1:51:47.980
 that I've been producing with some musicians

1:51:47.980 --> 1:51:51.020
 for a couple of books I'm gonna release in the fall.

1:51:51.020 --> 1:51:53.780
 Terrible books, ABC of childhood tragedy,

1:51:53.780 --> 1:51:57.180
 they're called dark, dark books,

1:51:58.500 --> 1:52:02.300
 dark and comical books, terrible books,

1:52:03.180 --> 1:52:05.260
 heartbreaking illustrations.

1:52:06.340 --> 1:52:07.620
 We've set them to music.

1:52:07.620 --> 1:52:09.420
 And so we play a piece from that.

1:52:09.420 --> 1:52:13.620
 And then afterwards, I usually meet about 150 people

1:52:13.620 --> 1:52:14.580
 to have photographs.

1:52:14.580 --> 1:52:17.220
 And so each of those is a little.

1:52:17.220 --> 1:52:20.020
 Is there a little sparkle of human connection?

1:52:20.020 --> 1:52:24.700
 A lot, a lot, it's very intense.

1:52:24.700 --> 1:52:27.060
 10 seconds with every person you think,

1:52:27.060 --> 1:52:28.660
 how can 10 seconds be intense?

1:52:28.660 --> 1:52:31.900
 It's like, pay enough attention.

1:52:31.900 --> 1:52:33.300
 It gets intense real quick.

1:52:33.300 --> 1:52:36.940
 Does it break your heart to say goodbye so many times?

1:52:36.940 --> 1:52:39.260
 It's like being in a wedding lineup,

1:52:39.260 --> 1:52:41.220
 at a wedding that you wanna be at.

1:52:41.220 --> 1:52:42.820
 And everybody's dressed up.

1:52:42.820 --> 1:52:43.860
 And that's so weird,

1:52:43.860 --> 1:52:45.340
 because I bought these expensive suits

1:52:45.340 --> 1:52:47.700
 when I went on tour and it broke my heart

1:52:47.700 --> 1:52:48.980
 because I spent so much money on them.

1:52:48.980 --> 1:52:51.420
 I thought, God, that's completely unconscionable.

1:52:51.420 --> 1:52:55.500
 I thought, no way, man, I'm in this 100%.

1:52:55.500 --> 1:52:58.820
 And so I'm gonna dress with respect.

1:52:58.820 --> 1:53:03.820
 And like 60% of the audience comes in

1:53:04.420 --> 1:53:05.940
 two or three piece suits.

1:53:05.940 --> 1:53:07.500
 They're all dressed up.

1:53:07.500 --> 1:53:09.300
 Then there's this line to greet me

1:53:09.300 --> 1:53:11.260
 and they're all happy to see me.

1:53:11.260 --> 1:53:13.260
 That's not so hard to take.

1:53:13.260 --> 1:53:15.120
 You know, although it is in a sense, right?

1:53:15.120 --> 1:53:19.060
 Because normal interactions are pretty shallow.

1:53:19.060 --> 1:53:21.060
 And you think, I don't want shallow interactions.

1:53:21.060 --> 1:53:22.860
 It's like, yes, you do most of the time.

1:53:22.860 --> 1:53:24.540
 Yeah, it's intense.

1:53:24.540 --> 1:53:25.740
 It's very intense.

1:53:25.740 --> 1:53:26.580
 And I don't know if you have.

1:53:26.580 --> 1:53:28.340
 But you've had a taste of this, no doubt,

1:53:28.340 --> 1:53:29.180
 because people recognize you.

1:53:29.180 --> 1:53:31.300
 Yeah, but I also have,

1:53:31.300 --> 1:53:34.540
 when a person recognizes me and they come with the love

1:53:34.540 --> 1:53:37.380
 and they're often brilliant people,

1:53:37.380 --> 1:53:39.860
 one of the thoughts I have to deal with,

1:53:39.860 --> 1:53:43.020
 one of the dragons in my own mind is, you know,

1:53:43.020 --> 1:53:45.860
 thinking that I don't deserve that kind of attention.

1:53:45.860 --> 1:53:46.700
 And so.

1:53:46.700 --> 1:53:48.220
 Well, you probably don't.

1:53:48.220 --> 1:53:49.060
 Right.

1:53:49.060 --> 1:53:50.300
 But maybe you could.

1:53:50.300 --> 1:53:53.060
 So it's a burden in that I have to step up

1:53:53.060 --> 1:53:56.260
 to be the kind of person that deserves that,

1:53:56.260 --> 1:53:58.200
 not deserves that, but in part deserves

1:53:58.200 --> 1:53:59.140
 that kind of attention.

1:53:59.140 --> 1:54:01.300
 And that's like, holy shit.

1:54:01.300 --> 1:54:02.580
 It's crucially important too,

1:54:02.580 --> 1:54:05.220
 because if someone comes up to you in an airport

1:54:05.220 --> 1:54:08.100
 and they know who you are and they're brave enough

1:54:08.100 --> 1:54:11.260
 to admire you or who you are attempting to be

1:54:11.260 --> 1:54:16.260
 and you make a mistake, they will never forget it.

1:54:16.780 --> 1:54:19.380
 So it's a high stakes enterprise.

1:54:19.380 --> 1:54:23.180
 And the flip side of that, especially with young people,

1:54:23.180 --> 1:54:25.460
 a few words you can say can change the direction

1:54:25.460 --> 1:54:26.420
 of their life.

1:54:26.420 --> 1:54:28.180
 One way or another.

1:54:28.180 --> 1:54:30.300
 And so I really have to watch this too in airports

1:54:30.300 --> 1:54:31.700
 because I do not like airports.

1:54:31.700 --> 1:54:34.620
 I do not like the creeping totalitarianism in airports.

1:54:34.620 --> 1:54:36.380
 They've always bothered me.

1:54:36.380 --> 1:54:38.380
 They really bother me.

1:54:38.380 --> 1:54:40.300
 And I'm an unpleasant travel companion

1:54:40.300 --> 1:54:42.020
 for my wife sometimes because of that.

1:54:42.020 --> 1:54:43.540
 Although I think we've worked that out.

1:54:43.540 --> 1:54:46.420
 Thank God, cause we're doing a lot of traveling.

1:54:46.420 --> 1:54:50.900
 But most of the security guards and the border personnel,

1:54:50.900 --> 1:54:52.340
 all those people, they know me.

1:54:52.340 --> 1:54:55.660
 And as a general rule, they're positively predisposed to me.

1:54:55.660 --> 1:54:57.740
 And so if I'm peevish or irritable,

1:54:57.740 --> 1:55:00.940
 then well, that's not good.

1:55:00.940 --> 1:55:02.100
 It's not good.

1:55:02.100 --> 1:55:03.860
 And so that's a tight rope to walk to

1:55:03.860 --> 1:55:07.180
 because I do not like that creeping totalitarianism.

1:55:07.180 --> 1:55:12.180
 But by the same token, if you're just one of the crowd,

1:55:12.180 --> 1:55:16.940
 just, sometimes it's good just to be one of the crowd

1:55:16.940 --> 1:55:18.180
 and then you're a little irritable

1:55:18.180 --> 1:55:19.700
 and people can just brush that off.

1:55:19.700 --> 1:55:24.860
 But if you're someone they have dared to open their heart to,

1:55:24.860 --> 1:55:29.860
 cause that's what admiration is, and then you betray that,

1:55:30.660 --> 1:55:34.100
 then that's a real, they'll never forget it.

1:55:34.100 --> 1:55:36.500
 And then they'll tell everyone too.

1:55:36.500 --> 1:55:39.540
 So it takes a lot of alertness.

1:55:39.540 --> 1:55:41.740
 And so Tammy and our life has got complicated

1:55:41.740 --> 1:55:43.860
 because in Toronto, for example,

1:55:43.860 --> 1:55:46.500
 we can't really just go for a walk.

1:55:46.500 --> 1:55:49.180
 It's always a high drama production

1:55:49.180 --> 1:55:52.580
 cause always people come up and they have some

1:55:52.580 --> 1:55:55.060
 heart rending story to tell.

1:55:55.060 --> 1:55:57.140
 And I'm not being cynical about that.

1:55:57.140 --> 1:55:58.380
 Yes.

1:55:58.380 --> 1:56:02.740
 It's a hard thing to bear because people don't do that.

1:56:02.740 --> 1:56:04.900
 They don't just open themselves up to you like that

1:56:04.900 --> 1:56:06.700
 and share the tragedy of their life.

1:56:09.660 --> 1:56:11.660
 But that's an everyday occurrence.

1:56:11.660 --> 1:56:13.580
 And so when we go up to our cottage,

1:56:13.580 --> 1:56:17.300
 which is out of the city, it's a relief,

1:56:17.300 --> 1:56:21.420
 because as wonderful as that is,

1:56:21.420 --> 1:56:23.140
 like it's a weird, I have a weird life

1:56:23.140 --> 1:56:25.860
 because everywhere I go, it's very weird.

1:56:25.860 --> 1:56:28.340
 It's like I'm surrounded by old friends

1:56:28.340 --> 1:56:31.580
 because I walk down the street in any city now virtually

1:56:31.580 --> 1:56:34.660
 and people say, hello, Dr. Peterson, so nice to see you.

1:56:34.660 --> 1:56:36.260
 Or they say better things than that.

1:56:36.260 --> 1:56:38.060
 Very rarely bad things.

1:56:38.060 --> 1:56:42.060
 One experience in 5,000, maybe very rare,

1:56:42.060 --> 1:56:44.220
 although you don't forget those either,

1:56:44.220 --> 1:56:46.780
 but it's very strange.

1:56:48.020 --> 1:56:48.860
 So.

1:56:48.860 --> 1:56:50.860
 And there's an intimacy, they know you well.

1:56:50.860 --> 1:56:54.540
 And because they leap into,

1:56:55.540 --> 1:56:57.540
 they avoid the small talk often.

1:56:57.540 --> 1:56:58.740
 They leap into familiarity.

1:56:58.740 --> 1:57:00.900
 It really is like it's an old friend

1:57:00.900 --> 1:57:01.860
 and it feels like that.

1:57:01.860 --> 1:57:06.460
 For me personally, the experiences, the goodbye hurts

1:57:06.460 --> 1:57:09.860
 because there's a sense

1:57:09.860 --> 1:57:11.580
 where you're never gonna see that friend again.

1:57:11.580 --> 1:57:12.700
 Right.

1:57:12.700 --> 1:57:14.380
 Yeah, that's a strange thing, eh?

1:57:14.380 --> 1:57:19.380
 So to me, a lot of it just feels like goodbyes.

1:57:19.380 --> 1:57:20.740
 Mm hmm.

1:57:20.740 --> 1:57:22.500
 It is.

1:57:22.500 --> 1:57:23.340
 You're right about that.

1:57:23.340 --> 1:57:26.660
 And I mean, that's, I suppose, in some sense,

1:57:26.660 --> 1:57:29.500
 part of the pain of opening yourself up to people

1:57:29.500 --> 1:57:33.020
 because they also, Tammy has been struck particularly.

1:57:33.020 --> 1:57:35.380
 She said, I really never knew what men were like.

1:57:35.380 --> 1:57:36.860
 I said, well, what do you mean?

1:57:36.860 --> 1:57:41.060
 She said, I cannot believe how polite the men are

1:57:41.060 --> 1:57:42.620
 when they come and talk to you

1:57:42.620 --> 1:57:43.900
 because it's always the same.

1:57:43.900 --> 1:57:45.580
 The pattern's very similar.

1:57:45.580 --> 1:57:47.140
 The person comes up, they're mostly men,

1:57:47.140 --> 1:57:49.140
 not always, but mostly.

1:57:49.140 --> 1:57:51.660
 And they're tentative and they're very polite,

1:57:51.660 --> 1:57:53.500
 very, very polite.

1:57:53.500 --> 1:57:55.540
 And they say, I hope I'm not bothering you.

1:57:55.540 --> 1:57:57.460
 Do you mind, you know, do you mind that I say

1:57:57.460 --> 1:57:59.100
 that they're not bothering me?

1:58:00.220 --> 1:58:03.220
 And I'm doing everything I can to not be the guy

1:58:03.220 --> 1:58:04.420
 who's bothered by that.

1:58:04.420 --> 1:58:05.780
 It's like, who do you think you are?

1:58:05.780 --> 1:58:07.460
 Yeah, yes.

1:58:07.460 --> 1:58:12.100
 You're the guy that what is famous and now is above that?

1:58:12.100 --> 1:58:13.220
 Yeah.

1:58:13.220 --> 1:58:15.260
 You don't wanna be that guy.

1:58:15.260 --> 1:58:17.740
 So you wanna be grateful all the time

1:58:17.740 --> 1:58:20.540
 when people open up like that.

1:58:20.540 --> 1:58:23.260
 And so you gotta be alert and on point

1:58:23.260 --> 1:58:25.180
 to do that properly, like right away.

1:58:25.180 --> 1:58:28.620
 Because for you, it's five seconds or 10 seconds

1:58:28.620 --> 1:58:30.140
 or 20 seconds, whatever it is.

1:58:30.140 --> 1:58:33.980
 But for them, they've opened up.

1:58:33.980 --> 1:58:37.540
 And so you can really nail them if you're foolish.

1:58:37.540 --> 1:58:40.660
 After the 150 people, how do you come down from that?

1:58:40.660 --> 1:58:44.660
 How do you find yourself again?

1:58:44.660 --> 1:58:48.420
 Well, that was when I got caught in Twitter traps,

1:58:48.420 --> 1:58:52.020
 cause I'm so burnt out by then from the talk

1:58:52.020 --> 1:58:56.220
 and the audience interactions and the whole day.

1:58:56.220 --> 1:58:58.740
 Cause it's a new city, it's a new hotel,

1:58:58.740 --> 1:59:02.260
 it's a new 5,000 people, it's a new book chapter,

1:59:02.260 --> 1:59:04.180
 it's a whole new horizon of ideas.

1:59:04.180 --> 1:59:06.740
 And it's off to another city the next day.

1:59:06.740 --> 1:59:10.740
 I'm so burnt out by then that I'm not as good

1:59:10.740 --> 1:59:13.500
 at controlling my impulses as I might be.

1:59:13.500 --> 1:59:15.340
 And Twitter was a real catastrophe for that

1:59:15.340 --> 1:59:17.500
 cause it would hook me and then I couldn't,

1:59:17.500 --> 1:59:20.820
 like I used to, when I was working on my book a lot,

1:59:20.820 --> 1:59:22.620
 I used to call Tammy and say, look,

1:59:22.620 --> 1:59:25.420
 you have to come and get me, I can't stop.

1:59:25.420 --> 1:59:28.420
 I can't stop, I got tired and then I kind of,

1:59:28.420 --> 1:59:31.700
 cause it's part of a kind of hypomanic focus.

1:59:31.700 --> 1:59:34.700
 I couldn't quit, it's like, oh no, I'm still writing.

1:59:34.700 --> 1:59:37.300
 I need to get away from this, but I couldn't stop.

1:59:37.300 --> 1:59:44.980
 And so it's better to read something, a book.

1:59:44.980 --> 1:59:46.100
 Fiction, nonfiction.

1:59:46.100 --> 1:59:48.500
 Fiction, Stephen King.

1:59:48.500 --> 1:59:50.300
 I was reading a lot of Stephen King

1:59:50.300 --> 1:59:52.420
 when I was on tour last time, that was good.

1:59:52.420 --> 1:59:53.260
 I like Stephen King a lot.

1:59:53.260 --> 1:59:54.580
 It's a great narrative.

1:59:54.580 --> 1:59:57.780
 Great, and great characterization, you know?

1:59:57.780 --> 2:00:02.220
 So, and there's a familiarity about Stephen King's

2:00:02.220 --> 2:00:05.340
 writing too that it's, he writes about people you know.

2:00:05.340 --> 2:00:08.140
 And so I really found that a relief.

2:00:08.140 --> 2:00:10.300
 And so that was useful.

2:00:10.300 --> 2:00:12.940
 And that in order to tolerate this, let's say,

2:00:12.940 --> 2:00:14.260
 or to be able to sustain it,

2:00:15.140 --> 2:00:16.740
 well, let's take a lot of negotiation

2:00:16.740 --> 2:00:17.860
 on the part of Tammy and I,

2:00:17.860 --> 2:00:21.420
 because she's dragged into this and, you know,

2:00:21.420 --> 2:00:25.100
 her life is part of this, whatever this is.

2:00:25.100 --> 2:00:29.060
 And she's had to find her way and has, for example,

2:00:29.060 --> 2:00:32.380
 now she has a different hotel room than me when we travel.

2:00:32.380 --> 2:00:35.380
 And she found that she didn't want to be on the tour

2:00:35.380 --> 2:00:37.940
 this spring, and I was ill again for part of it.

2:00:37.940 --> 2:00:39.060
 And that made it complicated,

2:00:39.060 --> 2:00:42.180
 but she went away back home and she came back

2:00:42.180 --> 2:00:43.420
 and she said, and she was nervous about,

2:00:43.420 --> 2:00:45.420
 she said, I think I need my own room.

2:00:45.420 --> 2:00:47.140
 And part of me was not happy with that.

2:00:47.140 --> 2:00:48.500
 It's like, what do you mean you need your,

2:00:48.500 --> 2:00:50.340
 like, are we not married anymore?

2:00:50.340 --> 2:00:52.380
 It's like, you need your own room?

2:00:52.380 --> 2:00:54.860
 And she said, well, you know, I can't,

2:00:54.860 --> 2:00:57.300
 she has to do exercises because she was really sick

2:00:57.300 --> 2:00:59.860
 and she has to keep herself in shape.

2:00:59.860 --> 2:01:02.220
 And she has to have some time to do that.

2:01:02.220 --> 2:01:03.780
 She does a lot of prayer and meditation

2:01:03.780 --> 2:01:04.700
 and she needs the time.

2:01:04.700 --> 2:01:06.860
 And she has her own podcast, which is going quite well.

2:01:06.860 --> 2:01:09.660
 And she needs the time and I trust her.

2:01:09.660 --> 2:01:12.420
 And she said, well, I need this in order to continue.

2:01:12.420 --> 2:01:15.180
 And I thought, well, okay,

2:01:15.180 --> 2:01:19.020
 if you need this in order to continue, yes.

2:01:19.020 --> 2:01:20.980
 Because she went away and didn't say, well,

2:01:20.980 --> 2:01:22.540
 I don't want to be on the tour.

2:01:22.540 --> 2:01:23.500
 I don't want to do this anymore.

2:01:23.500 --> 2:01:25.940
 She went away and prayed, let's say,

2:01:25.940 --> 2:01:28.740
 how can I continue to do this?

2:01:28.740 --> 2:01:30.420
 And that was the answer.

2:01:30.420 --> 2:01:32.740
 And so she has her own hotel room.

2:01:32.740 --> 2:01:36.100
 And that was a really good decision on her part.

2:01:36.100 --> 2:01:39.700
 And she's very good and getting better all the time

2:01:39.700 --> 2:01:43.820
 at figuring out what has to happen for her

2:01:43.820 --> 2:01:45.180
 to make this sustainable.

2:01:45.180 --> 2:01:48.380
 And all that's been is a plus

2:01:48.380 --> 2:01:51.020
 because I don't want to travel without her.

2:01:51.020 --> 2:01:53.580
 And I don't want her life to be miserable.

2:01:53.580 --> 2:01:55.540
 And I want her to be fully on board.

2:01:55.540 --> 2:01:58.340
 And so she has to be properly selfish.

2:01:58.340 --> 2:02:00.780
 Like everyone does in a relationship.

2:02:00.780 --> 2:02:02.900
 And you have to, not just that,

2:02:02.900 --> 2:02:05.260
 this is a weird thing that you're doing.

2:02:05.260 --> 2:02:08.180
 And you have to, both you and her have to figure out

2:02:08.180 --> 2:02:13.020
 how to manage this very intense intellectual,

2:02:13.020 --> 2:02:13.860
 social journey.

2:02:13.860 --> 2:02:15.180
 Well, there's another element to it too

2:02:15.180 --> 2:02:16.340
 that I didn't tell you about.

2:02:16.340 --> 2:02:19.460
 So that was a typical day, but it's missing a big component

2:02:19.460 --> 2:02:22.100
 because usually we also have a dinner

2:02:22.100 --> 2:02:26.780
 with like 30 cultural representatives, I suppose,

2:02:26.780 --> 2:02:28.700
 10 to 30 from each country.

2:02:28.700 --> 2:02:32.100
 Cause I have a network of people who have networks

2:02:32.100 --> 2:02:35.780
 who are setting me up with key decision makers

2:02:35.780 --> 2:02:37.140
 in each country.

2:02:37.140 --> 2:02:39.540
 And so then we have like an hour and a half of that.

2:02:39.540 --> 2:02:42.420
 Now, sometimes that's on a day when I don't have a talk,

2:02:42.420 --> 2:02:44.860
 but sometimes the talks are back to back.

2:02:44.860 --> 2:02:49.700
 And so she also has to manage that and to be gracious.

2:02:49.700 --> 2:02:51.700
 And then people are showing us exciting things

2:02:51.700 --> 2:02:53.940
 and tours in the cities and which is all,

2:02:53.940 --> 2:02:56.380
 like it's a surf fight of wonderful.

2:02:56.380 --> 2:02:57.340
 Yes, exactly.

2:02:57.340 --> 2:03:00.220
 But it's still, yeah, you have to be there for it.

2:03:00.220 --> 2:03:02.140
 You have to be present for it mentally.

2:03:02.140 --> 2:03:02.980
 Yeah.

2:03:02.980 --> 2:03:04.980
 As a curious mind, as an intellectual mind.

2:03:04.980 --> 2:03:07.820
 How do you get to sleep?

2:03:07.820 --> 2:03:11.820
 Fortunately, that is almost never a problem.

2:03:11.820 --> 2:03:16.820
 Even when I was unbelievably ill for about three years.

2:03:17.220 --> 2:03:18.700
 I thought about that a lot too, you know,

2:03:18.700 --> 2:03:21.380
 that I didn't do a really good job of explaining that

2:03:21.380 --> 2:03:24.760
 while I was ill because it appeared in some sense

2:03:24.760 --> 2:03:26.880
 that the reason I was ill was because I was taking

2:03:26.880 --> 2:03:30.860
 benzodiazepines, but that isn't why I was ill.

2:03:30.860 --> 2:03:33.580
 And then I took them and very low dose.

2:03:33.580 --> 2:03:36.140
 And I took that for a long time and it helped

2:03:36.140 --> 2:03:37.300
 whatever was wrong with me.

2:03:37.300 --> 2:03:39.380
 And it looks like it was an allergy

2:03:39.380 --> 2:03:41.020
 or maybe multiple allergies.

2:03:42.040 --> 2:03:45.000
 And then that stopped working.

2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:47.860
 And so I took a little bit more for about a month

2:03:47.860 --> 2:03:48.980
 and that made it way worse.

2:03:48.980 --> 2:03:52.220
 And so then I cut back a lot and then,

2:03:52.220 --> 2:03:54.300
 then things really got out of hand.

2:03:54.300 --> 2:03:55.140
 So.

2:03:55.140 --> 2:03:57.700
 So there was a deeper thing in the Benzo.

2:03:57.700 --> 2:03:58.540
 Oh yeah.

2:03:58.540 --> 2:04:00.180
 What can you put words to?

2:04:00.180 --> 2:04:02.220
 Well, I had a lot of immune, well, my daughter,

2:04:02.220 --> 2:04:06.040
 as everyone knows, has a very reactive immune system.

2:04:06.040 --> 2:04:09.800
 And Tammy has three immunological conditions,

2:04:09.800 --> 2:04:11.420
 each of them quite serious.

2:04:11.420 --> 2:04:14.360
 And I had psoriasis and peripheral uveitis,

2:04:14.360 --> 2:04:17.740
 which is an autoimmune condition and alopecia areata

2:04:17.740 --> 2:04:21.460
 and chronic gum disease, all of which appeared

2:04:21.460 --> 2:04:22.980
 to be allergy related.

2:04:22.980 --> 2:04:25.660
 And so Michaela seems to have got all of that.

2:04:25.660 --> 2:04:28.420
 And so that, and that I think was at the bottom of,

2:04:28.420 --> 2:04:30.540
 cause I also had this proclivity to depression

2:04:30.540 --> 2:04:32.840
 that was part of my family history.

2:04:32.840 --> 2:04:34.700
 But I think that was all immunological

2:04:34.700 --> 2:04:35.540
 as far as I can tell.

2:04:35.540 --> 2:04:37.780
 So one of the things that's happened to me,

2:04:37.780 --> 2:04:40.460
 I always noticed I really couldn't breathe.

2:04:40.460 --> 2:04:42.220
 Like I could breathe about one fifth

2:04:42.220 --> 2:04:45.140
 as much as I sometimes could.

2:04:46.500 --> 2:04:48.420
 And so I was always short of breath.

2:04:48.420 --> 2:04:53.060
 And it looks like what that was perhaps was

2:04:53.060 --> 2:04:56.380
 I was always on the border of an anaphylactic reaction,

2:04:56.380 --> 2:04:57.640
 which is not pleasant.

2:04:58.740 --> 2:05:01.140
 And that's hypersympathetic activation,

2:05:01.140 --> 2:05:03.140
 no parasympathetic activation.

2:05:03.140 --> 2:05:05.380
 I couldn't relax at all.

2:05:05.380 --> 2:05:07.380
 That's an immunological response.

2:05:07.380 --> 2:05:08.840
 Allergic response, yeah.

2:05:09.980 --> 2:05:11.580
 So anyways, that was what seemed,

2:05:11.580 --> 2:05:14.420
 now this, I don't like to talk about this much

2:05:14.420 --> 2:05:15.700
 cause it's so bloody radical

2:05:15.700 --> 2:05:17.220
 and I don't like to propagate it,

2:05:17.220 --> 2:05:19.580
 but this diet seems to have stopped all of that.

2:05:19.580 --> 2:05:22.580
 I don't have psoriasis, all of the patches have gone.

2:05:22.580 --> 2:05:25.420
 My gum disease, which is incurable,

2:05:25.420 --> 2:05:27.180
 I had multiple surgeries to deal with it,

2:05:27.180 --> 2:05:30.300
 is completely gone, took three years.

2:05:30.300 --> 2:05:32.180
 My right eye, which was quite cloudy,

2:05:32.180 --> 2:05:33.480
 it's cleared up completely.

2:05:35.820 --> 2:05:36.880
 What else has changed?

2:05:36.880 --> 2:05:41.180
 Well, I lost 50 pounds and like instantly kept it off.

2:05:41.180 --> 2:05:45.860
 I should mention that I too am not a deep investigator

2:05:45.860 --> 2:05:47.700
 of nutritional science.

2:05:47.700 --> 2:05:49.620
 I have my skepticism towards the degree

2:05:49.620 --> 2:05:51.580
 to which it is currently as a science.

2:05:51.580 --> 2:05:55.460
 Cause like a lot of complex systems is full of mystery

2:05:55.460 --> 2:05:57.960
 and full of profiteers,

2:05:57.960 --> 2:06:00.100
 the people that profit of different kinds of diets.

2:06:00.100 --> 2:06:02.300
 But I should say for me personally,

2:06:02.300 --> 2:06:05.100
 it does seem that I feel by far the best

2:06:05.100 --> 2:06:06.340
 when I eat only meat.

2:06:06.340 --> 2:06:07.260
 It's very interesting.

2:06:07.260 --> 2:06:10.020
 And I discovered that a long time ago.

2:06:10.020 --> 2:06:10.860
 First of all.

2:06:10.860 --> 2:06:12.220
 How did you discover it?

2:06:12.220 --> 2:06:15.540
 So by, the discovery went like this.

2:06:15.540 --> 2:06:17.920
 I started listening to ultra marathon runners

2:06:17.920 --> 2:06:20.380
 about 15 years ago.

2:06:20.380 --> 2:06:25.380
 And they started talking about fat adapted running.

2:06:27.260 --> 2:06:31.100
 So I first discovered that I don't have to run super fast

2:06:31.100 --> 2:06:32.420
 to enjoy running.

2:06:32.420 --> 2:06:35.420
 And in fact, I really enjoy running at a slower pace.

2:06:36.380 --> 2:06:37.500
 So that was like step one.

2:06:37.500 --> 2:06:38.380
 It's like, oh, okay.

2:06:38.380 --> 2:06:42.780
 If I maintain something called the math rule,

2:06:42.780 --> 2:06:45.020
 which is the pretty low heart rate.

2:06:45.020 --> 2:06:47.760
 If I maintain that you can actually get pretty fast

2:06:47.760 --> 2:06:50.660
 while maintaining a pretty slow average speed in general.

2:06:50.660 --> 2:06:54.860
 Anyway, they fuel themselves on low carb diets.

2:06:55.740 --> 2:06:57.300
 So I got into that.

2:06:57.300 --> 2:07:00.620
 On top of that, I also, they also fast often.

2:07:00.620 --> 2:07:05.620
 So I discovered how incredible my mind feels when fasted.

2:07:05.660 --> 2:07:08.180
 You know, people call it intermittent fasting, but.

2:07:08.180 --> 2:07:11.920
 Well, that's an optimization of death because you're,

2:07:11.920 --> 2:07:16.100
 when you fast, your body, logically and obviously,

2:07:16.100 --> 2:07:18.460
 if you think about it biologically is,

2:07:18.460 --> 2:07:20.920
 well, what is your body scavenge first?

2:07:20.920 --> 2:07:23.060
 Well, damaged tissue.

2:07:24.220 --> 2:07:27.940
 So the, and I know the literature on fasting

2:07:27.940 --> 2:07:30.680
 to some degree, and it's very compelling literature.

2:07:30.680 --> 2:07:35.080
 If you starve dogs down, I think it's 20% below rats too,

2:07:35.080 --> 2:07:38.180
 below their optimal body weight, they live 30% longer.

2:07:38.180 --> 2:07:43.180
 That's a lot, 30%, like it's like 30%, yeah, 30%.

2:07:43.860 --> 2:07:46.380
 Well, there is aspect to a lot of these things

2:07:46.380 --> 2:07:48.740
 that make me nervous because I always feel like

2:07:48.740 --> 2:07:51.520
 there's no free lunch that I'm gonna pay for it somehow.

2:07:51.520 --> 2:07:55.980
 But there's a focus that I am able to attain when I fast,

2:07:55.980 --> 2:07:57.900
 especially when I eat once a day.

2:07:57.900 --> 2:08:01.360
 My mind is almost like nervously focused.

2:08:01.360 --> 2:08:04.100
 It's almost like an anxiety, but a positive one

2:08:04.100 --> 2:08:07.180
 or one that I can channel into just like an excitement.

2:08:07.180 --> 2:08:10.500
 You know, I wonder how much of that's associated with,

2:08:10.500 --> 2:08:13.980
 well, imagine that that signifies lack of food,

2:08:13.980 --> 2:08:16.000
 which not that hard to imagine.

2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:17.900
 Well, maybe you should be a lot more alert

2:08:17.900 --> 2:08:19.300
 in that situation, right?

2:08:19.300 --> 2:08:22.780
 Biologically speaking, because you're in hunting mode,

2:08:22.780 --> 2:08:26.580
 let's say, you know, not desperate, but in hunting mode.

2:08:26.580 --> 2:08:29.460
 And God only knows maybe human beings

2:08:29.460 --> 2:08:31.180
 should be in hunting mode all the time.

2:08:31.180 --> 2:08:32.860
 Often, but we don't know that.

2:08:32.860 --> 2:08:37.500
 So I wonder if it has a stress on the system

2:08:37.500 --> 2:08:39.940
 that long term causes the system to get sick.

2:08:39.940 --> 2:08:41.260
 It doesn't look like it.

2:08:41.260 --> 2:08:43.620
 It seems in the case of fasting, not.

2:08:43.620 --> 2:08:46.340
 And then on top of that, I discovered that

2:08:46.340 --> 2:08:51.340
 the thing I enjoy, I just don't enjoy eating fat as much.

2:08:52.040 --> 2:08:55.600
 So I love eating meat when you talk about low carb diet.

2:08:55.600 --> 2:08:57.980
 So I just discovered through that process,

2:08:57.980 --> 2:09:00.860
 if somewhat fatty meat, but just meat,

2:09:00.860 --> 2:09:03.900
 I just feel a lot of the things

2:09:03.900 --> 2:09:05.500
 that make me feel weird about food,

2:09:05.500 --> 2:09:10.500
 like a little groggy or like full or just whatever,

2:09:11.620 --> 2:09:14.100
 the aspects of food that I don't enjoy,

2:09:14.100 --> 2:09:15.740
 they're not there with meat.

2:09:15.740 --> 2:09:18.420
 And I'm still able to enjoy company.

2:09:18.420 --> 2:09:22.300
 And when I eat once a day and eat meat,

2:09:22.300 --> 2:09:24.420
 I said, at least in Texas,

2:09:24.420 --> 2:09:27.180
 you could still have all the merriment of,

2:09:27.180 --> 2:09:28.780
 you have dinner with friends.

2:09:28.780 --> 2:09:33.060
 Now, I don't do the, you have a very serious thing

2:09:33.060 --> 2:09:37.140
 that there's health benefits

2:09:37.140 --> 2:09:39.420
 that you are very serious about.

2:09:39.420 --> 2:09:41.500
 For me, I can still drink whiskey.

2:09:41.500 --> 2:09:46.500
 I'll still do the things that add a little bit of spice

2:09:46.500 --> 2:09:47.580
 into the thing.

2:09:47.580 --> 2:09:49.700
 Now, when you completely remove the spice,

2:09:49.700 --> 2:09:52.300
 it does become more difficult.

2:09:52.300 --> 2:09:53.740
 Yeah, it's more difficult socially.

2:09:53.740 --> 2:09:56.540
 And Tammy seems to only be able to eat lamb,

2:09:56.540 --> 2:09:58.860
 although she might be able to eat non aged beef.

2:09:58.860 --> 2:10:02.220
 And that makes traveling complicated too, right?

2:10:02.220 --> 2:10:04.620
 Because, well, for obvious reasons,

2:10:04.620 --> 2:10:06.660
 it's like, really, that's all you can eat?

2:10:08.020 --> 2:10:09.780
 Yeah, well, celeries.

2:10:09.780 --> 2:10:12.300
 And maybe that's a form of craziness, but.

2:10:12.300 --> 2:10:13.940
 If we can return to actually the thing

2:10:13.940 --> 2:10:15.540
 you were talking about,

2:10:15.540 --> 2:10:18.460
 when you were thinking about a question before the lecture.

2:10:18.460 --> 2:10:20.660
 Let me ask you about thinking in general.

2:10:22.860 --> 2:10:25.220
 This is something maybe that you and Jim Keller

2:10:25.220 --> 2:10:27.780
 think a lot about is thinking how to think.

2:10:29.140 --> 2:10:32.900
 How do you think through an idea?

2:10:32.900 --> 2:10:35.500
 Well, first of all, I think, okay,

2:10:36.460 --> 2:10:38.060
 that's a really good question.

2:10:38.060 --> 2:10:40.100
 We tried to work that out with this essay app

2:10:40.100 --> 2:10:41.460
 that my son and I have developed,

2:10:41.460 --> 2:10:42.700
 because if you're gonna write,

2:10:42.700 --> 2:10:45.060
 the first question is, well, what should I write about?

2:10:45.060 --> 2:10:46.060
 What's the name of the app?

2:10:46.060 --> 2:10:48.140
 Essay.app.

2:10:48.140 --> 2:10:53.140
 And, well, the first question is, well, what bugs you?

2:10:53.540 --> 2:10:54.820
 What's bugging you?

2:10:54.820 --> 2:10:56.020
 This is such a cool thing.

2:10:56.020 --> 2:10:57.820
 It's like, where is my destiny?

2:10:59.220 --> 2:11:00.780
 Well, what bothers you?

2:11:00.780 --> 2:11:02.180
 Well, that's where your destiny is.

2:11:02.180 --> 2:11:04.860
 Your destiny is to be found in what bothers you.

2:11:04.860 --> 2:11:07.340
 Why did those things bother you?

2:11:07.340 --> 2:11:09.660
 There's a lot of things you could be bothered by.

2:11:09.660 --> 2:11:11.460
 Like a million things, man.

2:11:11.460 --> 2:11:13.580
 But some things grip you.

2:11:13.580 --> 2:11:14.500
 They bug you.

2:11:14.500 --> 2:11:16.700
 And they might make you resentful and bitter,

2:11:16.700 --> 2:11:17.900
 because they bug you so much.

2:11:17.900 --> 2:11:20.020
 Like, they're your things, man.

2:11:20.020 --> 2:11:21.500
 They've got you.

2:11:21.500 --> 2:11:23.700
 So then I look for a question

2:11:23.700 --> 2:11:25.980
 that I would like the answer to,

2:11:25.980 --> 2:11:29.740
 that I don't, and I would really like the answer to it,

2:11:29.740 --> 2:11:32.380
 so I don't assume I already have the answer,

2:11:32.380 --> 2:11:35.340
 because I would actually really like to have the answer.

2:11:35.340 --> 2:11:39.220
 So if I could get a better answer, great.

2:11:39.220 --> 2:11:40.220
 And so that's the first thing.

2:11:40.220 --> 2:11:41.660
 And that's like a prayer.

2:11:41.660 --> 2:11:45.300
 It's like, okay, here's a mystery.

2:11:45.300 --> 2:11:49.740
 I would like to delve into it further.

2:11:49.740 --> 2:11:51.060
 Well, so that's humility.

2:11:51.060 --> 2:11:52.620
 It's like, here's a mystery,

2:11:52.620 --> 2:11:54.100
 which means I don't know.

2:11:54.100 --> 2:11:55.900
 I would like to delve into it further,

2:11:55.900 --> 2:11:58.100
 which means I don't know enough already.

2:11:58.940 --> 2:12:01.860
 And then comes the revelation.

2:12:01.860 --> 2:12:04.340
 It's like, well, what's a revelation?

2:12:04.340 --> 2:12:08.620
 Well, if you ask yourself a question, it's a real question.

2:12:08.620 --> 2:12:10.340
 Do you get an answer or not?

2:12:10.340 --> 2:12:11.660
 And the answer is, well, yeah,

2:12:11.660 --> 2:12:14.020
 thoughts start to appear in your head.

2:12:14.020 --> 2:12:14.860
 So...

2:12:14.860 --> 2:12:15.700
 From somewhere.

2:12:15.700 --> 2:12:16.540
 That's right, from somewhere.

2:12:16.540 --> 2:12:17.740
 Where do they come from?

2:12:17.740 --> 2:12:19.300
 Do you have a sense?

2:12:19.300 --> 2:12:21.620
 Depends on what you're aiming at.

2:12:21.620 --> 2:12:23.260
 Depends on the question.

2:12:23.260 --> 2:12:26.300
 No, no, it does to some degree.

2:12:26.300 --> 2:12:29.060
 It depends on your intent.

2:12:29.060 --> 2:12:32.540
 So imagine that your intent is to make things better.

2:12:33.940 --> 2:12:35.340
 Then maybe they come from the place

2:12:35.340 --> 2:12:37.300
 that's designed to make things better.

2:12:37.300 --> 2:12:39.820
 Maybe your intent is to make things worse.

2:12:39.820 --> 2:12:41.340
 Then they come from hell.

2:12:42.300 --> 2:12:43.420
 And you think, not really.

2:12:43.420 --> 2:12:45.940
 It's like, you're so sure about that, are you?

2:12:45.940 --> 2:12:47.380
 Is your intent conscious?

2:12:47.380 --> 2:12:49.660
 Like, are you able to introspect with the intent?

2:12:49.660 --> 2:12:51.740
 Conscious and habitual, right?

2:12:51.740 --> 2:12:54.060
 Because as you practise something consciously,

2:12:54.060 --> 2:12:55.300
 it becomes habitual.

2:12:55.300 --> 2:12:56.220
 But it's conscious.

2:12:56.220 --> 2:12:59.620
 It's like when I sit down before I do a lecture,

2:12:59.620 --> 2:13:01.700
 I think, okay, what's the goal here?

2:13:01.700 --> 2:13:04.140
 To do the best job I can.

2:13:04.140 --> 2:13:05.100
 To what end?

2:13:05.100 --> 2:13:08.540
 Well, people are coming here not for political issues.

2:13:08.540 --> 2:13:09.740
 They're coming here because they're trying

2:13:09.740 --> 2:13:11.780
 to make their lives better.

2:13:11.780 --> 2:13:13.020
 Okay, so what are we doing?

2:13:13.020 --> 2:13:14.940
 We're conducting a joint investigation

2:13:14.940 --> 2:13:17.500
 into the nature of that which makes life better.

2:13:17.500 --> 2:13:18.740
 Okay, what's my role?

2:13:18.740 --> 2:13:21.780
 To do as good a job about that as possible.

2:13:21.780 --> 2:13:23.620
 What state of mind do I have to be in?

2:13:23.620 --> 2:13:25.980
 Am I annoyed about the theatre?

2:13:25.980 --> 2:13:30.260
 Or am I clued in and thrilled that 4,000 people

2:13:30.260 --> 2:13:33.620
 have showed up at substantial expense and trouble

2:13:33.620 --> 2:13:35.420
 to come and listen to me talk?

2:13:35.420 --> 2:13:36.940
 And if I'm not in that state of mind,

2:13:36.940 --> 2:13:38.380
 I think, well, maybe I need something to eat

2:13:38.380 --> 2:13:39.900
 or maybe I need to talk to someone

2:13:39.900 --> 2:13:44.460
 because ingratitude is no place to start.

2:13:44.460 --> 2:13:48.180
 It's like, I should be thrilled to be there, obviously.

2:13:48.180 --> 2:13:50.260
 And so that orientation has to be there.

2:13:50.260 --> 2:13:51.460
 And then I, is it conscious?

2:13:51.460 --> 2:13:52.740
 All this is conscious.

2:13:52.740 --> 2:13:53.860
 What am I serving?

2:13:53.860 --> 2:13:55.780
 The highest good I can conceptualize.

2:13:55.780 --> 2:13:56.900
 What is that?

2:13:56.900 --> 2:13:58.700
 I have some sense, but I don't know it

2:13:58.700 --> 2:14:01.540
 in the final analysis, which is why the investigation

2:14:01.540 --> 2:14:02.620
 is being conducted.

2:14:02.620 --> 2:14:03.660
 Who's doing it?

2:14:03.660 --> 2:14:07.820
 Me, whoever I'm communing with, and the audience.

2:14:07.820 --> 2:14:11.140
 And so I try to get myself and I chase everybody away

2:14:11.140 --> 2:14:13.500
 for that, it's like I have to do that by myself.

2:14:13.500 --> 2:14:14.900
 Are you writing stuff down?

2:14:14.900 --> 2:14:19.300
 Yes, at that point, I just make point notes.

2:14:19.300 --> 2:14:21.980
 And it's usually about maybe 30 notes.

2:14:21.980 --> 2:14:24.220
 But then I, on stage, I never refer to them.

2:14:24.220 --> 2:14:27.740
 And I often don't even use the structure that I laid out.

2:14:27.740 --> 2:14:29.300
 Kind of an interesting thing.

2:14:29.300 --> 2:14:31.460
 From where do powerful phrases come from?

2:14:31.460 --> 2:14:35.820
 Do you have a, do you try to encapsulate an idea

2:14:35.820 --> 2:14:38.420
 into a sentence or two?

2:14:38.420 --> 2:14:42.620
 Well, when I talk, and I've practiced this since,

2:14:42.620 --> 2:14:47.620
 consciously, since 1985, I try to feel

2:14:48.860 --> 2:14:52.140
 and see if the words are stepping stones

2:14:52.140 --> 2:14:53.860
 or foundation stones, right?

2:14:53.860 --> 2:14:55.260
 It's like, is this solid?

2:14:55.260 --> 2:14:56.500
 Is this word solid?

2:14:56.500 --> 2:14:57.860
 Is this phrase solid?

2:14:57.860 --> 2:14:59.660
 Is this sentence solid?

2:14:59.660 --> 2:15:04.180
 It's a real sense of fundamental foundation

2:15:04.180 --> 2:15:05.100
 under each word.

2:15:05.100 --> 2:15:08.220
 And I suppose people ask me if I pray.

2:15:08.220 --> 2:15:13.220
 And I would say, I pray before every word.

2:15:14.220 --> 2:15:16.300
 Well, when you're asking questions,

2:15:16.300 --> 2:15:21.220
 like you're very clear headed and present

2:15:21.220 --> 2:15:25.500
 in your ability to ask questions and inquire.

2:15:25.500 --> 2:15:27.300
 So how do you do that?

2:15:27.300 --> 2:15:32.300
 So first of all, I'm worried that my mind

2:15:32.300 --> 2:15:37.300
 easily gets trapped when I step on a word

2:15:39.180 --> 2:15:41.860
 and I know it's unstable.

2:15:42.980 --> 2:15:45.380
 You kind of realize that you don't really know

2:15:45.380 --> 2:15:47.900
 the definitions of many words you use.

2:15:47.900 --> 2:15:51.540
 And that can be debilitating.

2:15:52.660 --> 2:15:56.620
 So I kind of try to be more carefree about the words I use.

2:15:57.580 --> 2:15:59.180
 Because otherwise you get trapped.

2:15:59.180 --> 2:16:00.860
 You don't want to be obsessional.

2:16:00.860 --> 2:16:04.860
 Like literally, my mind halfway through the sentence

2:16:04.860 --> 2:16:08.620
 will think, well, what does the word sentence mean?

2:16:08.620 --> 2:16:09.620
 Right, right, right.

2:16:09.620 --> 2:16:10.460
 Well, you know, neurologically.

2:16:10.460 --> 2:16:12.580
 And then everything else just explodes.

2:16:12.580 --> 2:16:14.660
 Your big picture idea explodes

2:16:14.660 --> 2:16:17.380
 and you lost yourself in the minutiae.

2:16:17.380 --> 2:16:21.860
 Well, neurologically, there's a production center

2:16:21.860 --> 2:16:23.780
 and an editing center.

2:16:23.780 --> 2:16:27.180
 And those can be separately affected by strokes.

2:16:27.180 --> 2:16:30.380
 And so often when people are writing or talking,

2:16:30.380 --> 2:16:33.100
 they try to activate both at the same time.

2:16:33.100 --> 2:16:35.700
 And that's, so people will try to write an essay

2:16:35.700 --> 2:16:37.500
 and get every sentence right in the first draft.

2:16:37.500 --> 2:16:38.940
 That's a big mistake.

2:16:38.940 --> 2:16:40.020
 And so then you might say, well,

2:16:40.020 --> 2:16:42.780
 how can you be careful with your words, but carefree?

2:16:42.780 --> 2:16:46.180
 And the answer is orient yourself properly, right?

2:16:46.180 --> 2:16:48.260
 While in the conversation we're having,

2:16:48.260 --> 2:16:50.020
 you have an orientation structure.

2:16:50.020 --> 2:16:52.020
 You want to be prepared.

2:16:52.020 --> 2:16:53.860
 You want to be attentive.

2:16:53.860 --> 2:16:56.300
 Then you want to have an interesting conversation.

2:16:56.300 --> 2:16:58.340
 And you want to have the kind of interesting conversation

2:16:58.340 --> 2:17:01.500
 that other people want to listen to.

2:17:01.500 --> 2:17:04.460
 That will be good for them in some manner.

2:17:04.460 --> 2:17:06.300
 Okay, so that's pretty good frame.

2:17:06.300 --> 2:17:09.180
 And then you kind of scour your heart

2:17:09.180 --> 2:17:10.780
 and you think, is that really what you want?

2:17:10.780 --> 2:17:12.820
 Are you after fame or after notoriety?

2:17:12.820 --> 2:17:14.180
 Are you after money?

2:17:14.180 --> 2:17:17.740
 I'm not saying any of those things are necessarily bad,

2:17:17.740 --> 2:17:20.020
 but they're not optimal,

2:17:20.020 --> 2:17:22.820
 especially if you're not willing to admit them, right?

2:17:22.820 --> 2:17:24.620
 And so they can contaminate you.

2:17:24.620 --> 2:17:26.780
 So you want to be decontaminated.

2:17:26.780 --> 2:17:29.500
 So you have the right trip, let's say.

2:17:29.500 --> 2:17:31.900
 And so you have to put yourself,

2:17:31.900 --> 2:17:33.100
 that's a meditative practice.

2:17:33.100 --> 2:17:36.620
 You have to put yourself in the right receptive position

2:17:36.620 --> 2:17:38.140
 with the right goal in mind.

2:17:38.140 --> 2:17:39.980
 Then you can,

2:17:41.380 --> 2:17:43.340
 and I think you can get better and better at this,

2:17:43.340 --> 2:17:47.300
 then you can trust what's going to happen.

2:17:47.300 --> 2:17:49.620
 You know, so for example, before I came here,

2:17:50.820 --> 2:17:52.780
 I mean, I presume you have a reason

2:17:52.780 --> 2:17:55.780
 for doing the podcast with me.

2:17:55.780 --> 2:17:56.820
 What's the reason?

2:17:59.980 --> 2:18:03.060
 I mean, we wanted to talk for a long time.

2:18:03.060 --> 2:18:04.540
 So the reason has evolved.

2:18:07.380 --> 2:18:12.220
 One of the reasons is I've listened to you

2:18:12.220 --> 2:18:13.220
 for quite a long time.

2:18:13.220 --> 2:18:15.540
 So you've become a one way friend

2:18:15.540 --> 2:18:17.660
 and I have many one way friends.

2:18:17.660 --> 2:18:20.220
 Some of my best friends don't even know I exist.

2:18:21.300 --> 2:18:24.020
 So I'm a big fan of podcasts and audio books.

2:18:24.020 --> 2:18:26.060
 Actually, most of my friends are dead.

2:18:26.060 --> 2:18:26.900
 Yeah, right.

2:18:28.020 --> 2:18:28.860
 The writers.

2:18:28.860 --> 2:18:30.140
 The definition of a reader.

2:18:32.140 --> 2:18:34.380
 It's a lot of dead, great dead friends.

2:18:34.380 --> 2:18:37.460
 So I wanted to meet this one way friend, I suppose,

2:18:37.460 --> 2:18:39.420
 and have a conversation.

2:18:39.420 --> 2:18:42.420
 And then there's this kind of puzzle

2:18:42.420 --> 2:18:44.020
 that I've been longing to solve.

2:18:44.020 --> 2:18:46.460
 The same reason I went to Ukraine

2:18:46.460 --> 2:18:50.500
 of asking this question of myself, who am I?

2:18:50.500 --> 2:18:52.980
 And what was this part of the world?

2:18:52.980 --> 2:18:56.260
 What is this thing that happened in the 20th century?

2:18:56.260 --> 2:18:59.420
 That I lost so much of my family there

2:18:59.420 --> 2:19:03.540
 and I feel so much of my family is defined by that place.

2:19:03.540 --> 2:19:06.860
 Now that place includes the Soviet Union

2:19:06.860 --> 2:19:09.620
 and it includes Russia and Ukraine.

2:19:09.620 --> 2:19:11.100
 It includes Nazi Germany,

2:19:11.100 --> 2:19:14.580
 includes these big powerful leaders

2:19:14.580 --> 2:19:19.580
 and huge millions of people that were lost in the beauty,

2:19:19.580 --> 2:19:24.580
 the power of the dream, but were also the torture

2:19:25.460 --> 2:19:28.220
 that was forced onto them

2:19:28.220 --> 2:19:32.460
 through different governmental institutions.

2:19:32.460 --> 2:19:36.340
 And you are somebody that seemed from some angle

2:19:36.340 --> 2:19:41.340
 to also be drawn to try to understand what was that.

2:19:41.340 --> 2:19:43.820
 And not in some sort of historical sense,

2:19:43.820 --> 2:19:46.500
 but in a deeply psychological human sense.

2:19:46.500 --> 2:19:47.340
 What is that?

2:19:47.340 --> 2:19:49.700
 What is that, will it repeat again?

2:19:49.700 --> 2:19:51.700
 In what way is it repeating again?

2:19:51.700 --> 2:19:53.060
 And how can we stop it?

2:19:53.060 --> 2:19:54.100
 And how can we stop it?

2:19:54.100 --> 2:19:55.580
 And so. That's the crucial issue.

2:19:55.580 --> 2:20:00.060
 I felt I wanted to, from a very different backgrounds,

2:20:01.940 --> 2:20:04.180
 pull at the thread of that curiosity.

2:20:04.180 --> 2:20:08.580
 You know, I'm an engineer, you're a psychologist,

2:20:08.580 --> 2:20:12.580
 both lost in that curiosity and both wear suits.

2:20:12.580 --> 2:20:17.020
 And a talk with various levels of eloquence

2:20:18.700 --> 2:20:23.580
 about sort of the shadows that these,

2:20:23.580 --> 2:20:28.580
 that history casts on us.

2:20:28.580 --> 2:20:30.340
 And so that was one.

2:20:30.340 --> 2:20:31.580
 And also the psychology,

2:20:31.580 --> 2:20:33.660
 I wanted to be a psychiatrist for a long time.

2:20:33.660 --> 2:20:37.620
 I was fascinated by the human mind

2:20:38.860 --> 2:20:41.060
 until I discovered artificial intelligence,

2:20:41.060 --> 2:20:44.180
 the fact that I could program and make a robot move.

2:20:44.180 --> 2:20:47.660
 And until I discovered that magic,

2:20:47.660 --> 2:20:50.020
 I thought I wanted to understand the human mind

2:20:50.020 --> 2:20:52.060
 by being psychiatrist, by talking to people,

2:20:52.060 --> 2:20:55.020
 by to talk therapy, psychotherapy.

2:20:55.020 --> 2:20:56.700
 So now you've got the best of both worlds

2:20:56.700 --> 2:20:59.740
 because you get to talk to people and you get build robots.

2:20:59.740 --> 2:21:03.580
 Yeah, I mean, but the dream ultimately is the robot.

2:21:03.580 --> 2:21:05.860
 That I felt like by building the thing,

2:21:05.860 --> 2:21:08.380
 can you start to try to understand it.

2:21:08.380 --> 2:21:09.460
 That's one way.

2:21:09.460 --> 2:21:12.540
 I mean, we all have different skills and proclivities.

2:21:12.540 --> 2:21:17.540
 So like my particular one is, has to do with,

2:21:20.100 --> 2:21:22.100
 I learned by building.

2:21:22.100 --> 2:21:25.580
 I think through a thing by building it.

2:21:25.580 --> 2:21:27.620
 And programming is a wonderful thing

2:21:27.620 --> 2:21:30.620
 because it allows you to like build a little toy example.

2:21:30.620 --> 2:21:33.780
 So in the same way you can do a little thought experiment,

2:21:33.780 --> 2:21:35.740
 programming allows you to create a thought experiment

2:21:35.740 --> 2:21:38.740
 in action, it can move, it can live, it can,

2:21:38.740 --> 2:21:40.220
 and then you can ask questions of it.

2:21:40.220 --> 2:21:44.940
 So all of those, because of my interest in Freud and Young,

2:21:46.820 --> 2:21:49.820
 you're also in different ways,

2:21:49.820 --> 2:21:54.820
 have delved deeply into humanity, the human psyche

2:21:56.660 --> 2:22:00.260
 through the perspective of those psychologists.

2:22:00.260 --> 2:22:04.380
 So for all those reasons, I thought our paths were crossed.

2:22:04.380 --> 2:22:07.460
 Yeah, so that's quite a frame for a discussion, right?

2:22:07.460 --> 2:22:09.820
 You had all sorts of reasons, and then you think,

2:22:09.820 --> 2:22:12.300
 well, are you just letting the conversation

2:22:12.300 --> 2:22:13.140
 go where it will?

2:22:13.140 --> 2:22:15.420
 It's like, well, not exactly.

2:22:15.420 --> 2:22:17.780
 You spent all this time,

2:22:17.780 --> 2:22:19.780
 it's not like this came about by accident,

2:22:19.780 --> 2:22:22.980
 this conversation, you spent all this time framing it.

2:22:22.980 --> 2:22:26.740
 And so all of that provides the implicit substructure

2:22:26.740 --> 2:22:28.540
 for the play in the conversation.

2:22:28.540 --> 2:22:31.420
 And if you have that implicit, here's another way,

2:22:31.420 --> 2:22:34.220
 this is very much worth knowing is,

2:22:34.220 --> 2:22:36.860
 if you get the implicit structure of perception right,

2:22:36.860 --> 2:22:39.060
 everything becomes a game.

2:22:40.500 --> 2:22:42.220
 And not only that, a game you wanna play,

2:22:42.220 --> 2:22:44.020
 and maybe in the final analysis,

2:22:44.020 --> 2:22:45.780
 a game you'd wanna play forever.

2:22:47.020 --> 2:22:52.020
 So that's obviously a distant beckoning ideal,

2:22:52.140 --> 2:22:57.140
 but we know only games need rules, or there's no play.

2:22:58.260 --> 2:23:03.100
 Is there advice you can give, now that we know the frame,

2:23:03.100 --> 2:23:08.100
 to give to me, Lex, about how to do this podcast better,

2:23:09.500 --> 2:23:14.500
 how to think about this world,

2:23:17.940 --> 2:23:19.860
 how to be a good engineer,

2:23:20.900 --> 2:23:25.460
 how to be a good human being, from what you know about me.

2:23:25.460 --> 2:23:28.180
 Take your preoccupation with suffering seriously.

2:23:28.180 --> 2:23:32.660
 It's a serious business, right?

2:23:32.660 --> 2:23:34.380
 And that's part of that,

2:23:34.380 --> 2:23:37.060
 to circle back to the beginning, let's say,

2:23:37.060 --> 2:23:39.260
 that's that willingness to gaze into the abyss,

2:23:39.260 --> 2:23:40.780
 which is obviously what you were doing

2:23:40.780 --> 2:23:42.620
 when you went to Ukraine.

2:23:42.620 --> 2:23:47.620
 It's like, it's gazing into the abyss that makes you better.

2:23:47.620 --> 2:23:51.380
 The thing is, and this is maybe where Nietzsche's ideas,

2:23:51.380 --> 2:23:54.500
 not as differentiated as it became,

2:23:54.500 --> 2:23:57.780
 sometimes your gaze can be forcefully directed

2:23:57.780 --> 2:24:01.740
 towards the abyss, and then you're traumatized.

2:24:01.740 --> 2:24:04.900
 If it's involuntary and accidental, it can kill you.

2:24:05.860 --> 2:24:10.860
 The more it's voluntary, the more transformative it is.

2:24:11.660 --> 2:24:14.900
 And that's part of that idea about facing death and hell.

2:24:14.900 --> 2:24:18.140
 It's like, can you tolerate death and hell?

2:24:18.140 --> 2:24:21.340
 And the answer is, this terrible answer is,

2:24:21.340 --> 2:24:26.340
 yes, to the degree that you're willing to do it voluntarily.

2:24:27.620 --> 2:24:29.420
 And then you might ask, well,

2:24:29.420 --> 2:24:33.460
 why should I have to subject myself to death and hell?

2:24:33.460 --> 2:24:35.060
 I'm innocent.

2:24:35.060 --> 2:24:36.980
 And then the answer to that is,

2:24:40.980 --> 2:24:43.940
 even the innocent must be voluntarily sacrificed

2:24:43.940 --> 2:24:44.940
 to the highest good.

2:24:44.940 --> 2:24:48.940
 Even the innocent must be voluntarily sacrificed to the highest good.

2:24:54.340 --> 2:24:56.380
 That's such an interesting distinction.

2:24:58.700 --> 2:24:59.780
 Voluntary suffering.

2:24:59.780 --> 2:25:01.940
 Voluntary, yeah, yeah.

2:25:01.940 --> 2:25:04.900
 Well, that's why the central Christian doctrine is,

2:25:04.900 --> 2:25:06.980
 pick up your cross and follow me.

2:25:08.460 --> 2:25:11.740
 And I'm speaking, not in religious terms saying that,

2:25:11.740 --> 2:25:13.580
 I'm just speaking as a psychologist.

2:25:13.580 --> 2:25:15.300
 It's like one of the things we've learned

2:25:15.300 --> 2:25:19.260
 in the last 100 years is voluntary exposure to that

2:25:19.260 --> 2:25:22.100
 which freezes and terrifies you

2:25:22.100 --> 2:25:25.220
 in measured proportions is curative.

2:25:26.660 --> 2:25:30.220
 So a form of, at least in part,

2:25:30.220 --> 2:25:32.460
 involuntary suffering is depression.

2:25:34.940 --> 2:25:38.860
 Do you have advice for people on how to find a way out?

2:25:40.300 --> 2:25:43.460
 You're a man who has suffered in this way.

2:25:43.460 --> 2:25:46.140
 Perhaps continue to suffer in this way.

2:25:46.140 --> 2:25:47.660
 How do you find a way out?

2:25:51.780 --> 2:25:53.620
 The first thing I do as a clinician,

2:25:53.620 --> 2:25:55.700
 if someone comes to me and says they're depressed

2:25:55.700 --> 2:25:57.340
 is ask myself a question.

2:25:58.420 --> 2:26:00.460
 Well, what does this person mean by that?

2:26:00.460 --> 2:26:02.340
 So I have to find out like,

2:26:02.340 --> 2:26:03.620
 because maybe they're not depressed,

2:26:03.620 --> 2:26:05.100
 maybe they're hyper anxious,

2:26:05.100 --> 2:26:06.820
 or maybe they're obsessional.

2:26:06.820 --> 2:26:10.380
 Like there's various forms of powerful negative emotion.

2:26:10.380 --> 2:26:12.340
 So they need to be differentiated.

2:26:12.340 --> 2:26:14.100
 But then the next question you have to ask is,

2:26:14.100 --> 2:26:16.860
 well, are you depressed?

2:26:16.860 --> 2:26:19.260
 Or do you have a terrible life?

2:26:19.260 --> 2:26:21.820
 Or is it some combination of the two?

2:26:21.820 --> 2:26:26.180
 So if you're depressed, as far as I can tell,

2:26:26.180 --> 2:26:27.740
 you don't have a terrible life.

2:26:29.100 --> 2:26:30.860
 You have friends, you have family,

2:26:30.860 --> 2:26:32.140
 you have an intimate relationship,

2:26:32.140 --> 2:26:33.660
 you have a job or a career,

2:26:33.660 --> 2:26:35.380
 you're about as educated as you should be

2:26:35.380 --> 2:26:36.820
 given your intelligence,

2:26:36.820 --> 2:26:39.220
 use your time outside of work wisely,

2:26:39.220 --> 2:26:42.620
 you're not beholden to alcohol or other temptations.

2:26:44.100 --> 2:26:47.580
 You're engaged in the community in some fundamental sense,

2:26:47.580 --> 2:26:49.420
 and all that's working.

2:26:49.420 --> 2:26:52.580
 Now, if you have all that and you're feeling really awful,

2:26:52.580 --> 2:26:54.900
 you're either ill or you're depressed.

2:26:54.900 --> 2:26:57.740
 And so then sometimes there's a biochemical route

2:26:57.740 --> 2:26:59.220
 to that treatment of that.

2:26:59.220 --> 2:27:02.860
 My experience has been as a clinician is if you're depressed,

2:27:02.860 --> 2:27:05.660
 but you have a life and you take an antidepressant,

2:27:05.660 --> 2:27:07.220
 it will probably help you a lot.

2:27:07.220 --> 2:27:09.780
 Now, maybe you're not depressed.

2:27:09.780 --> 2:27:12.620
 Exactly, you just have a terrible life.

2:27:12.620 --> 2:27:13.940
 What does that look like?

2:27:15.820 --> 2:27:19.100
 You have no relationship, your family's a mess,

2:27:19.100 --> 2:27:22.660
 you've got no friends, you've got no plan, you've got no job.

2:27:23.540 --> 2:27:25.220
 You use your time outside of work

2:27:25.220 --> 2:27:27.380
 not only badly but destructively.

2:27:27.380 --> 2:27:29.700
 You have a drug or alcohol habit

2:27:29.700 --> 2:27:32.660
 or some other vice, pornography addiction.

2:27:33.660 --> 2:27:36.420
 You're completely unengaged in the surrounding community.

2:27:36.420 --> 2:27:40.380
 You have no scaffolding whatsoever to support you

2:27:40.380 --> 2:27:43.420
 in your current mode of being or you move forward.

2:27:43.420 --> 2:27:47.820
 And then as a therapist, well, you do two things.

2:27:47.820 --> 2:27:50.180
 Well, if it's depression per se,

2:27:50.180 --> 2:27:52.900
 well, like I said, there's sometimes a biochemical route,

2:27:52.900 --> 2:27:55.820
 a nutritional route, there's ways that can be addressed.

2:27:55.820 --> 2:27:58.780
 It's probably physiological if you're, at least in part,

2:27:58.780 --> 2:28:00.980
 if you're depressed, but you have an okay life.

2:28:00.980 --> 2:28:03.020
 Sometimes it's conceptual.

2:28:03.020 --> 2:28:05.860
 You can turn to dreams sometimes to help people.

2:28:05.860 --> 2:28:09.100
 Cause dreams contain the seeds of the potential future.

2:28:09.100 --> 2:28:11.460
 And if your person is a real good dreamer

2:28:11.460 --> 2:28:13.900
 and you can analyze dreams, that can be really helpful.

2:28:13.900 --> 2:28:16.860
 But that seems to be only true for more creative people.

2:28:16.860 --> 2:28:18.820
 And for the people who just have a terrible life,

2:28:18.820 --> 2:28:22.140
 it's like, okay, you have a terrible life.

2:28:22.140 --> 2:28:26.180
 Well, let's pick a front.

2:28:26.180 --> 2:28:29.380
 How about you need a friend?

2:28:29.380 --> 2:28:32.460
 Like one sort of friend.

2:28:32.460 --> 2:28:36.300
 Do you know how to shake hands and introduce yourself?

2:28:36.300 --> 2:28:38.780
 I'll have the person show me.

2:28:38.780 --> 2:28:40.420
 So let's do it for a sec.

2:28:40.420 --> 2:28:45.060
 So it's like this, hi, I'm Jordan, right?

2:28:45.060 --> 2:28:46.780
 And people don't know how to do that.

2:28:46.780 --> 2:28:49.100
 And then they can't even get the ball rolling.

2:28:49.100 --> 2:28:51.340
 For the listener, Jordan just gave me a firm handshake.

2:28:51.340 --> 2:28:54.380
 Yeah, as opposed to a dead fish, you know?

2:28:54.380 --> 2:28:56.940
 And there's these elementary social skills

2:28:56.940 --> 2:28:59.780
 that hypothetically, if you were well cared for,

2:28:59.780 --> 2:29:02.060
 you learned when you were like three

2:29:02.060 --> 2:29:04.940
 and sometimes people have, I had lots of clients

2:29:06.380 --> 2:29:09.940
 to whom no one ever paid any attention.

2:29:09.940 --> 2:29:12.740
 And they needed like 10,000 hours of attention.

2:29:12.740 --> 2:29:14.020
 And some of that was just listening

2:29:14.020 --> 2:29:17.620
 because they had 10,000 hours of conversations

2:29:17.620 --> 2:29:19.260
 they never had with anyone.

2:29:19.260 --> 2:29:21.620
 And they were all tangled up in their head.

2:29:21.620 --> 2:29:24.940
 And they had to just, one client in particular,

2:29:24.940 --> 2:29:28.500
 I worked with this person for 15 years.

2:29:28.500 --> 2:29:33.260
 And what she wanted from me

2:29:33.260 --> 2:29:36.420
 was for me just to shut the hell up for 50 minutes.

2:29:36.420 --> 2:29:38.020
 It was very hard for me.

2:29:38.020 --> 2:29:42.020
 And to just tell me what had happened to her.

2:29:42.020 --> 2:29:44.980
 And then what happened at the end of the conversation,

2:29:44.980 --> 2:29:48.100
 then I could discuss a bit with her.

2:29:48.100 --> 2:29:50.300
 And then as we progressed through the years,

2:29:50.300 --> 2:29:52.620
 the amount of time that we spent in discussion

2:29:52.620 --> 2:29:55.220
 increased in proportion in the sessions

2:29:55.220 --> 2:29:58.780
 until by the time we stopped seeing each other,

2:29:58.780 --> 2:30:00.820
 when my clinical practice collapsed,

2:30:02.580 --> 2:30:06.380
 we were talking about 80% of the time.

2:30:06.380 --> 2:30:07.500
 But she literally,

2:30:07.500 --> 2:30:09.980
 she'd never been attended to properly ever.

2:30:09.980 --> 2:30:13.620
 And so she was an uncarved block in the Taoist sense, right?

2:30:13.620 --> 2:30:16.380
 She hadn't been subjected to those flaming swords

2:30:16.380 --> 2:30:19.380
 that separated the wheat from the chaff.

2:30:19.380 --> 2:30:22.740
 And so you can do that in therapy.

2:30:22.740 --> 2:30:25.420
 If you're listening and you're depressed,

2:30:25.420 --> 2:30:28.340
 I would say if you can't find a therapist,

2:30:28.340 --> 2:30:29.820
 and that's getting harder and harder

2:30:29.820 --> 2:30:32.220
 because it's actually become illegal to be a therapist now

2:30:32.220 --> 2:30:34.500
 because you have to agree with your clients,

2:30:34.500 --> 2:30:37.420
 which is a terrible thing to do with them.

2:30:37.420 --> 2:30:40.700
 Just like it's terrible just to arbitrarily oppose them.

2:30:40.700 --> 2:30:44.060
 You could do the self authoring program online

2:30:44.060 --> 2:30:46.580
 because it helps you write an autobiography.

2:30:46.580 --> 2:30:48.100
 And so if you have memories

2:30:48.100 --> 2:30:49.420
 that are more than 18 months old

2:30:49.420 --> 2:30:51.580
 that bother you when you think them up,

2:30:51.580 --> 2:30:54.340
 part of you is locked inside that.

2:30:54.340 --> 2:30:59.340
 An undeveloped part of you is still trapped in that.

2:30:59.780 --> 2:31:01.620
 That's a metaphorical way of thinking about,

2:31:01.620 --> 2:31:04.140
 that's why it still has emotional significance.

2:31:04.140 --> 2:31:06.780
 So you can write about your past experiences,

2:31:06.780 --> 2:31:08.780
 but I would say wait for at least 18 months

2:31:08.780 --> 2:31:10.500
 if something bad has happened to you.

2:31:10.500 --> 2:31:12.100
 Because otherwise you just hurt yourself again

2:31:12.100 --> 2:31:13.220
 by encountering it.

2:31:14.180 --> 2:31:16.740
 You can bring yourself up to date with an autobiography.

2:31:16.740 --> 2:31:18.940
 There's an analysis of faults and virtues,

2:31:18.940 --> 2:31:20.060
 that's the present authoring.

2:31:20.060 --> 2:31:23.700
 And then there's a guided writing exercise

2:31:23.700 --> 2:31:25.980
 that helps you make a future plan.

2:31:25.980 --> 2:31:30.460
 That's young men who do that could go to college,

2:31:30.460 --> 2:31:32.500
 young men who do that, 90 minutes,

2:31:32.500 --> 2:31:34.460
 just the future authoring, 90 minutes,

2:31:34.460 --> 2:31:37.260
 they're 50% less likely to drop out.

2:31:37.260 --> 2:31:38.900
 That's all it takes.

2:31:38.900 --> 2:31:43.540
 So sometimes depression is this heavy cloud

2:31:43.540 --> 2:31:46.300
 that makes it hard to even make a single step towards it.

2:31:46.300 --> 2:31:48.860
 Or you said isolate, make a friend.

2:31:48.860 --> 2:31:52.060
 Oh man, sometimes the first step is extremely difficult.

2:31:52.060 --> 2:31:54.940
 Oh my God, sometimes it's way worse than that.

2:31:54.940 --> 2:31:57.100
 Like I had clients who were so depressed

2:31:57.100 --> 2:31:59.060
 they literally couldn't get out of bed.

2:31:59.940 --> 2:32:01.180
 So what's their first step?

2:32:01.180 --> 2:32:05.940
 It's like, can you sit up once today?

2:32:05.940 --> 2:32:06.780
 No.

2:32:07.980 --> 2:32:10.620
 Can you prop yourself up on your elbows once today?

2:32:10.620 --> 2:32:14.060
 Like you just, you scale back the dragon

2:32:14.060 --> 2:32:16.980
 till you find one that's conquerable

2:32:16.980 --> 2:32:18.140
 that moves you forward.

2:32:18.140 --> 2:32:19.900
 There's a rubric for life.

2:32:19.900 --> 2:32:23.180
 Scale back the dragons till you find one conquerable

2:32:23.180 --> 2:32:25.900
 and it'll give you a little bit of goal.

2:32:25.900 --> 2:32:27.300
 Commensurate with the struggle.

2:32:27.300 --> 2:32:29.140
 But the plus side of that,

2:32:29.140 --> 2:32:31.060
 cause that's, you think that God, that's depressing.

2:32:31.060 --> 2:32:35.460
 You mean I have to start by sitting up?

2:32:35.460 --> 2:32:37.740
 Well you do if you can't sit up.

2:32:37.740 --> 2:32:39.380
 But the plus side of that is

2:32:39.380 --> 2:32:40.980
 it's the Pareto distribution issue

2:32:40.980 --> 2:32:45.860
 is that aggregates exponentially increase

2:32:45.860 --> 2:32:47.980
 and failures do too by the way.

2:32:47.980 --> 2:32:50.140
 But aggregates exponentially increase.

2:32:50.140 --> 2:32:51.580
 So once you start the ball rolling

2:32:51.580 --> 2:32:53.380
 it can get zipping along pretty good.

2:32:53.380 --> 2:32:55.020
 This person that I talked about

2:32:56.660 --> 2:33:00.460
 was incapable of sitting with me in a cafe

2:33:00.460 --> 2:33:02.100
 when we first met just talking

2:33:02.100 --> 2:33:04.180
 even though I was her therapist.

2:33:04.180 --> 2:33:07.380
 But by the end she was doing standup comedy.

2:33:08.300 --> 2:33:10.900
 So, you know, it took years,

2:33:10.900 --> 2:33:14.020
 but still most people won't do standup comedy.

2:33:14.020 --> 2:33:15.940
 That's quite the bloody achievement.

2:33:15.940 --> 2:33:19.220
 She would read her poetry on stage too.

2:33:20.100 --> 2:33:23.860
 So for someone who was petrified into paralysis

2:33:23.860 --> 2:33:28.860
 by social anxiety and who had to start very small,

2:33:29.060 --> 2:33:31.620
 it was a hell of an accomplishment.

2:33:31.620 --> 2:33:33.940
 Yeah, it all starts with one step.

2:33:33.940 --> 2:33:38.260
 Do you have advice for young people in high school?

2:33:38.260 --> 2:33:40.580
 You've given, a lot of people look up to you

2:33:40.580 --> 2:33:42.540
 for advice, for strength,

2:33:42.540 --> 2:33:47.540
 for strength to search for themselves, to find themselves.

2:33:47.940 --> 2:33:49.660
 Take on some responsibility.

2:33:50.980 --> 2:33:53.220
 Do something for other people.

2:33:53.220 --> 2:33:55.660
 You're doing something for yourself while you're doing that

2:33:55.660 --> 2:33:57.780
 even if you don't know it, for sure.

2:33:57.780 --> 2:34:00.220
 Cause you're a community across time.

2:34:00.220 --> 2:34:02.540
 Find something to serve.

2:34:02.540 --> 2:34:03.700
 Somebody to help.

2:34:03.700 --> 2:34:06.980
 Someone to help, a job to, find a job,

2:34:06.980 --> 2:34:08.900
 do your best with the customers.

2:34:08.900 --> 2:34:10.220
 Don't be above your job.

2:34:10.220 --> 2:34:12.780
 You're gonna get an entry level job when you're a kid

2:34:12.780 --> 2:34:14.700
 or what else would you want?

2:34:14.700 --> 2:34:15.540
 You wanna be the boss?

2:34:15.540 --> 2:34:16.380
 What do you know?

2:34:16.380 --> 2:34:17.780
 You don't know anything.

2:34:17.780 --> 2:34:20.260
 You could be the boss of your job.

2:34:20.260 --> 2:34:22.140
 You know, if you're working in a grocery store

2:34:22.140 --> 2:34:23.380
 or you're working in a convenience store,

2:34:23.380 --> 2:34:26.620
 assuming you're not working for terrified tyrants,

2:34:26.620 --> 2:34:28.700
 you can be nice to the customers.

2:34:28.700 --> 2:34:30.940
 You can develop your social skills.

2:34:30.940 --> 2:34:34.140
 You can learn how to handle boss employee relationship.

2:34:34.140 --> 2:34:37.780
 You can be there 15 minutes early and leave 15 minutes late.

2:34:37.780 --> 2:34:40.340
 Like you can learn in an entry level job, man.

2:34:40.340 --> 2:34:42.860
 And I'll tell you, if you take an entry level job

2:34:42.860 --> 2:34:45.820
 and you learn and it's a reasonably decent place,

2:34:45.820 --> 2:34:48.420
 you will not be in an entry level job for long

2:34:48.420 --> 2:34:50.060
 because everyone who's competent

2:34:50.060 --> 2:34:52.100
 is desperate for competent people.

2:34:52.100 --> 2:34:54.140
 And if you go and show yourself as competent,

2:34:54.140 --> 2:34:55.140
 there'll be a trial period.

2:34:55.140 --> 2:34:57.140
 But if you go show yourself as competent,

2:34:57.140 --> 2:34:59.260
 all sorts of doors you didn't even know were there

2:34:59.260 --> 2:35:01.060
 will start opening like mad.

2:35:01.060 --> 2:35:04.420
 So you strive for competence, for craftsmanship.

2:35:04.420 --> 2:35:08.980
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, for discipline, you know, I mean,

2:35:08.980 --> 2:35:11.020
 I said in one of the chapters,

2:35:11.020 --> 2:35:14.180
 my books is focused on putting your house in order.

2:35:14.180 --> 2:35:15.780
 It's like, well, how do you start?

2:35:15.780 --> 2:35:16.700
 Make your bed.

2:35:18.020 --> 2:35:21.540
 You know, it actually took me quite a long time in my life

2:35:21.540 --> 2:35:23.580
 before I made my bed regularly in the morning.

2:35:23.580 --> 2:35:25.380
 Most of my life was pretty good order,

2:35:25.380 --> 2:35:27.700
 but that was one thing I didn't have in order.

2:35:27.700 --> 2:35:31.060
 My clothes in my closet as well, all that's in order.

2:35:31.060 --> 2:35:33.300
 Not all of it, I'm cleaning out some drawers right now,

2:35:33.300 --> 2:35:37.980
 but look around and see what bugs you in your room.

2:35:37.980 --> 2:35:39.180
 Just look.

2:35:39.180 --> 2:35:40.940
 It's like, okay, I'm in my room.

2:35:40.940 --> 2:35:41.900
 Do I like this room?

2:35:41.900 --> 2:35:43.100
 No, it bugs me.

2:35:43.100 --> 2:35:44.820
 Okay, why?

2:35:44.820 --> 2:35:47.380
 Well, the paint's peeling there and it's dusty there

2:35:47.380 --> 2:35:50.900
 and the carpet's dirty and that corner's kind of ugly

2:35:50.900 --> 2:35:52.380
 and the light there isn't very good.

2:35:52.380 --> 2:35:54.380
 And my clothes closet's a mess,

2:35:54.380 --> 2:35:56.540
 so I don't even like to open it.

2:35:56.540 --> 2:35:59.180
 Okay, that's a lot of problems.

2:35:59.180 --> 2:36:00.380
 That sucks.

2:36:00.380 --> 2:36:02.340
 That's a lot of opportunity.

2:36:02.340 --> 2:36:04.300
 Pick something and fix it.

2:36:04.300 --> 2:36:05.980
 Something that bugs you.

2:36:05.980 --> 2:36:07.460
 Yeah, but not too much.

2:36:07.460 --> 2:36:11.980
 So the rule is pick something you know would make,

2:36:11.980 --> 2:36:14.900
 pick a problem, pick a solution to it

2:36:14.900 --> 2:36:18.980
 that you know would help, that you could do,

2:36:18.980 --> 2:36:20.740
 that you would do.

2:36:20.740 --> 2:36:22.220
 So you have to negotiate with yourself.

2:36:22.220 --> 2:36:23.860
 It's like, well, I won't clean up this room.

2:36:23.860 --> 2:36:24.700
 How do you know?

2:36:24.700 --> 2:36:27.060
 I've been in here for 10 years and I've never cleaned it up.

2:36:27.060 --> 2:36:29.700
 It's like, well, obviously that's too big a dragon for you.

2:36:29.700 --> 2:36:32.340
 Would you clean one drawer?

2:36:32.340 --> 2:36:33.180
 Find out.

2:36:34.020 --> 2:36:35.740
 And so imagine now you wanna be happy

2:36:35.740 --> 2:36:37.140
 when you open that drawer and you think,

2:36:37.140 --> 2:36:37.980
 well, that's stupid.

2:36:37.980 --> 2:36:38.820
 It's like, is it?

2:36:40.140 --> 2:36:41.580
 Maybe it's your sock drawer,

2:36:41.580 --> 2:36:43.380
 which I cleaned up in my room the other day.

2:36:43.380 --> 2:36:46.220
 By the way, you're gonna open that every morning.

2:36:47.580 --> 2:36:50.820
 That's like 30 seconds of your life every day.

2:36:50.820 --> 2:36:54.940
 Okay, so that's three minutes a week.

2:36:54.940 --> 2:36:57.340
 That's 12 minutes a month.

2:36:57.340 --> 2:36:59.580
 That's two hours a year.

2:36:59.580 --> 2:37:01.140
 So maybe your life is made out of,

2:37:01.140 --> 2:37:02.740
 you've got 16 hours a day.

2:37:02.740 --> 2:37:03.660
 Let's figure this out.

2:37:03.660 --> 2:37:08.660
 Five, 12 in an hour, 12 in an hour, 144 in 12 hours.

2:37:09.180 --> 2:37:12.060
 Yeah, let's say 200, 205 minute chunks.

2:37:12.060 --> 2:37:12.900
 That's your life.

2:37:12.900 --> 2:37:15.300
 Ladies and gentlemen, Jordan Peterson did just some math

2:37:15.300 --> 2:37:17.460
 how many five minute chunks there are in a day.

2:37:17.460 --> 2:37:19.300
 And I'm pretty sure it's pretty accurate.

2:37:19.300 --> 2:37:20.620
 It's approximately right.

2:37:20.620 --> 2:37:24.580
 So you got 205 minute chunks and they repeat.

2:37:24.580 --> 2:37:26.380
 A lot of them repeat.

2:37:26.380 --> 2:37:28.260
 So if you get every one of those right,

2:37:28.260 --> 2:37:29.620
 they're trivial, right, who cares

2:37:29.620 --> 2:37:30.740
 what my sock drawer looks like.

2:37:30.740 --> 2:37:33.100
 It's like, fair enough, man, but that's your life.

2:37:33.100 --> 2:37:36.820
 The things you repeat every day, the mundane things.

2:37:36.820 --> 2:37:39.340
 Think I could get all those mundane things right.

2:37:39.340 --> 2:37:40.620
 That's the game rules.

2:37:40.620 --> 2:37:43.380
 It's like now all the mundane is in place.

2:37:43.380 --> 2:37:45.900
 Now you can play because all the mundane is in place.

2:37:45.900 --> 2:37:47.020
 And this is actually true.

2:37:47.020 --> 2:37:51.020
 So with children, imagine you want your children to play.

2:37:51.020 --> 2:37:53.660
 Well, play is very fragile neurologically.

2:37:53.660 --> 2:37:57.340
 Any competing motivation or emotion will suppress play.

2:37:57.340 --> 2:37:59.300
 So everything has to be in order.

2:38:00.260 --> 2:38:02.060
 Everything has to be a walled garden

2:38:02.060 --> 2:38:04.100
 before the children will play.

2:38:04.100 --> 2:38:05.940
 That's a good way of thinking about it.

2:38:05.940 --> 2:38:07.460
 So you put everything in order and you think,

2:38:07.460 --> 2:38:09.540
 oh my God, now I'm tyrannized by this order.

2:38:09.540 --> 2:38:12.540
 It's like, no, you aren't, not if it's voluntary.

2:38:12.540 --> 2:38:15.700
 And then the order is the precondition for the freedom.

2:38:15.700 --> 2:38:16.660
 And so then all of a sudden

2:38:16.660 --> 2:38:17.940
 you get all these things in order.

2:38:17.940 --> 2:38:19.340
 It's like, oh, look at this.

2:38:19.340 --> 2:38:21.620
 I've got some room to play here.

2:38:21.620 --> 2:38:24.820
 And then maybe you're not depressed.

2:38:24.820 --> 2:38:26.580
 Now it's often not that simple.

2:38:26.580 --> 2:38:28.620
 You know, it's not that simple.

2:38:28.620 --> 2:38:31.060
 Try putting your room in order, perfect order.

2:38:31.060 --> 2:38:31.900
 That's hard.

2:38:31.900 --> 2:38:33.020
 I mean, it's a really powerful way

2:38:33.020 --> 2:38:34.460
 to think about those five minute chunks.

2:38:34.460 --> 2:38:36.620
 Just get one of them right in a day.

2:38:36.620 --> 2:38:39.380
 Yeah, well, if you do that for 200 days,

2:38:39.380 --> 2:38:40.660
 your life is in order.

2:38:41.940 --> 2:38:43.980
 You know, I thought I did that with my clients a lot.

2:38:43.980 --> 2:38:45.500
 So a lot of them would come home from work,

2:38:45.500 --> 2:38:47.940
 the guys, and their wives would meet them at the door

2:38:47.940 --> 2:38:49.940
 and it'd be a fight right away.

2:38:49.940 --> 2:38:51.140
 You know, and it's a clash there

2:38:51.140 --> 2:38:53.300
 because he comes home and he's tired and hungry.

2:38:53.300 --> 2:38:55.700
 He's worked all day and he's hoping that, you know,

2:38:55.700 --> 2:38:57.980
 he gets welcomed when he comes back to the home,

2:38:57.980 --> 2:38:59.820
 but then the wife is at home

2:38:59.820 --> 2:39:01.060
 and she's been with the kids all day

2:39:01.060 --> 2:39:02.660
 and she's tired and hungry and she's hoping

2:39:02.660 --> 2:39:04.900
 that when he comes home, he'll show her some appreciation

2:39:04.900 --> 2:39:05.820
 for what's happened today.

2:39:05.820 --> 2:39:08.220
 And then they clash and then they both have problems

2:39:08.220 --> 2:39:09.700
 to discuss because they've had their troubles

2:39:09.700 --> 2:39:10.540
 during the day.

2:39:10.540 --> 2:39:13.180
 And so then every time they get together,

2:39:13.180 --> 2:39:16.300
 they're not like it's a bit of a fight for 20 minutes

2:39:16.300 --> 2:39:18.900
 and then the whole evening is screwed.

2:39:18.900 --> 2:39:21.820
 And so then you think, okay, here's the deal.

2:39:23.060 --> 2:39:24.940
 It's knock and the door will open.

2:39:24.940 --> 2:39:28.900
 Okay, you get to pick what happens when you come home,

2:39:28.900 --> 2:39:30.180
 but you have to figure out what it is.

2:39:30.180 --> 2:39:31.940
 So now this is the deal.

2:39:31.940 --> 2:39:33.860
 You treat yourself properly.

2:39:33.860 --> 2:39:35.300
 You imagine coming home

2:39:35.300 --> 2:39:38.580
 and it goes the way you want and need it to go.

2:39:38.580 --> 2:39:41.380
 Okay, what does that look like?

2:39:41.380 --> 2:39:44.100
 You get to have it, but you have to know what it is.

2:39:44.100 --> 2:39:45.980
 What does it look like?

2:39:45.980 --> 2:39:48.020
 And you think, okay, I want to come home.

2:39:48.020 --> 2:39:49.980
 I want to be happy about coming home.

2:39:49.980 --> 2:39:53.540
 I come home, I open the door.

2:39:53.540 --> 2:39:56.020
 I say, hello, honey, I'm home.

2:39:56.020 --> 2:39:58.740
 My wife says, hi, it's so nice to hear your voice.

2:39:58.740 --> 2:40:02.380
 She comes up, she says, hi, dear.

2:40:02.380 --> 2:40:03.220
 She gives you a hug.

2:40:03.220 --> 2:40:05.060
 She says, how was your day?

2:40:05.060 --> 2:40:07.380
 And you say, well, we'll sit and talk about that.

2:40:07.380 --> 2:40:08.660
 How was your day?

2:40:08.660 --> 2:40:10.500
 Well, we'll sit and talk about that.

2:40:10.500 --> 2:40:12.700
 Do you need something to eat?

2:40:12.700 --> 2:40:16.220
 Probably, let's go sit and talk about our day.

2:40:16.220 --> 2:40:18.100
 It's like, that sounds pretty good.

2:40:18.100 --> 2:40:19.980
 Okay, that sounds pretty good.

2:40:19.980 --> 2:40:20.820
 Might not be perfect,

2:40:20.820 --> 2:40:21.940
 but sounds a hell of a lot better

2:40:21.940 --> 2:40:23.180
 than what we're doing now.

2:40:23.180 --> 2:40:26.220
 So how about we go talk to,

2:40:26.220 --> 2:40:28.020
 we'll go talk to your wife and say,

2:40:28.020 --> 2:40:31.020
 okay, this is what's happening when I come home.

2:40:31.020 --> 2:40:32.700
 I would like it to be better.

2:40:32.700 --> 2:40:34.500
 What would you like to have happened

2:40:35.420 --> 2:40:37.220
 if you could have what you wanted?

2:40:37.220 --> 2:40:39.220
 And so she sits down and she thinks,

2:40:39.220 --> 2:40:41.500
 okay, if he comes home, what do I want to have happen?

2:40:41.500 --> 2:40:44.180
 And then now you got two visions and you say,

2:40:44.180 --> 2:40:45.140
 well, what would you like?

2:40:45.140 --> 2:40:48.900
 And you listen and she says, what would you like?

2:40:48.900 --> 2:40:50.540
 And you tell her, and then you think,

2:40:50.540 --> 2:40:53.300
 okay, now how can we bring these visions together?

2:40:53.300 --> 2:40:55.580
 So not only do we both get what we want,

2:40:55.580 --> 2:40:57.020
 but because we've brought them together,

2:40:57.020 --> 2:40:58.580
 we even get more than we want.

2:40:58.580 --> 2:40:59.940
 Well, who wouldn't agree to that

2:40:59.940 --> 2:41:01.860
 unless they were aiming down.

2:41:01.860 --> 2:41:02.820
 And that's so exciting.

2:41:02.820 --> 2:41:04.300
 It's not a compromise.

2:41:04.300 --> 2:41:08.300
 It's a union of ideals that even makes a better ideal.

2:41:08.300 --> 2:41:09.460
 And then you get to come home.

2:41:09.460 --> 2:41:12.100
 And then there's another rule that goes along with that,

2:41:12.100 --> 2:41:15.700
 which is, please, dear, have the grace

2:41:16.660 --> 2:41:19.660
 to allow me to do this stupidly and badly

2:41:19.660 --> 2:41:23.140
 while I learn at least 20 times.

2:41:23.140 --> 2:41:25.940
 And I'll give you the same leeway,

2:41:25.940 --> 2:41:28.900
 and then we'll practice stupidly for 20 times

2:41:28.900 --> 2:41:30.500
 and we'll talk about it.

2:41:30.500 --> 2:41:31.980
 And then maybe we'll get it right

2:41:31.980 --> 2:41:35.460
 for the next 10,000 times, right?

2:41:35.460 --> 2:41:37.860
 And you can do that with your whole life.

2:41:37.860 --> 2:41:39.100
 And you can do that with your kids

2:41:39.100 --> 2:41:40.860
 and you can do that with your family.

2:41:40.860 --> 2:41:42.500
 Like it's not easy, but you can do it.

2:41:42.500 --> 2:41:44.580
 It's a lot easier than the alternative.

2:41:44.580 --> 2:41:47.540
 Let me ask for some dating advice from Jordan Peterson.

2:41:47.540 --> 2:41:52.460
 How do you find on that topic the love of your life?

2:41:52.460 --> 2:41:54.500
 That's a good question.

2:41:54.500 --> 2:41:58.020
 I was asked that multiple times on my tour,

2:41:58.020 --> 2:41:59.540
 three times in a row, in fact,

2:41:59.540 --> 2:42:02.900
 because we ask people to use this Slido gadget.

2:42:03.900 --> 2:42:05.060
 That's a popular question?

2:42:05.060 --> 2:42:06.020
 To vary.

2:42:06.020 --> 2:42:07.220
 It always came up to the top.

2:42:07.220 --> 2:42:10.220
 And I got asked that three times in a row

2:42:10.220 --> 2:42:11.700
 and I didn't have a good answer.

2:42:11.700 --> 2:42:16.380
 And then I thought, why don't I have a good answer?

2:42:16.380 --> 2:42:17.900
 I thought, oh, I know why.

2:42:17.900 --> 2:42:19.700
 Cause that's a stupid question.

2:42:19.700 --> 2:42:24.140
 So why?

2:42:24.140 --> 2:42:25.420
 Why?

2:42:25.420 --> 2:42:27.900
 Because it's putting the cart before the horse.

2:42:27.900 --> 2:42:29.260
 Here's the right question.

2:42:31.300 --> 2:42:33.500
 How do I make myself into the perfect date?

2:42:34.860 --> 2:42:36.220
 You answer that question

2:42:36.220 --> 2:42:37.820
 and you will not have any problem

2:42:37.820 --> 2:42:39.140
 answering the previous question.

2:42:39.140 --> 2:42:42.020
 It's like, what do I want in a partner?

2:42:44.260 --> 2:42:46.300
 If I offered everything I could to a partner

2:42:46.300 --> 2:42:47.940
 who would I be?

2:42:47.940 --> 2:42:49.140
 You work on that.

2:42:49.140 --> 2:42:49.980
 Ask that question.

2:42:49.980 --> 2:42:50.820
 Just ask.

2:42:50.820 --> 2:42:52.620
 Just ask yourself, okay.

2:42:52.620 --> 2:42:57.540
 I have to be the person that women would want.

2:42:59.420 --> 2:43:00.620
 Okay, what do they want?

2:43:02.580 --> 2:43:03.820
 Clean.

2:43:03.820 --> 2:43:05.300
 That's not a bad start.

2:43:07.820 --> 2:43:09.740
 Reasonably good physical shape.

2:43:11.300 --> 2:43:16.180
 So healthy, productive,

2:43:16.180 --> 2:43:18.180
 generous, honest,

2:43:19.860 --> 2:43:21.620
 willing to delay gratification.

2:43:21.620 --> 2:43:22.820
 So you dance with a woman.

2:43:22.820 --> 2:43:23.740
 It's like, what's she doing?

2:43:23.740 --> 2:43:24.780
 What are you two doing?

2:43:24.780 --> 2:43:26.540
 Well, it's a pattern.

2:43:26.540 --> 2:43:28.060
 There's patterns happening around you.

2:43:28.060 --> 2:43:30.340
 That's the music, patterns, patterns of being.

2:43:30.340 --> 2:43:31.780
 That's the music.

2:43:31.780 --> 2:43:32.940
 Now, can you align yourself

2:43:32.940 --> 2:43:35.140
 with the patterns of being gracefully?

2:43:35.140 --> 2:43:37.340
 That's what she's checking out.

2:43:37.340 --> 2:43:40.380
 And then can you do that with her?

2:43:41.500 --> 2:43:43.460
 And then can you do that in a playful

2:43:43.460 --> 2:43:46.660
 and attentive manner and keep your bloody hands

2:43:46.660 --> 2:43:48.620
 to yourself for at least a minute?

2:43:49.620 --> 2:43:52.900
 And so can you dance in a playful manner?

2:43:52.900 --> 2:43:55.300
 It's like, you can go through this in your imagination

2:43:55.300 --> 2:43:58.020
 and you know, you'll know, you know.

2:43:58.020 --> 2:44:00.340
 And then you think, well, how far am I from those things?

2:44:00.340 --> 2:44:01.780
 And the answer is usually, man,

2:44:01.780 --> 2:44:06.620
 it's pretty horrible abyss separating you from that ideal.

2:44:06.620 --> 2:44:11.620
 But the harder you work on offering other people

2:44:11.620 --> 2:44:13.820
 what they need and want,

2:44:13.820 --> 2:44:16.660
 the more people will line up to play with you.

2:44:16.660 --> 2:44:18.060
 And so it's the wrong question.

2:44:18.060 --> 2:44:21.020
 It's like, how can I be the best partner possible?

2:44:21.020 --> 2:44:22.460
 And then you think, well, if I do that,

2:44:22.460 --> 2:44:25.020
 people will just take advantage of me.

2:44:25.020 --> 2:44:28.860
 And that's the non naive objection, right?

2:44:28.860 --> 2:44:30.620
 Because the naive person is saying, well, I'll be good

2:44:30.620 --> 2:44:31.620
 and everyone will treat me right.

2:44:31.620 --> 2:44:34.620
 It's like the cynic says, no, I'll be good

2:44:34.620 --> 2:44:37.420
 and someone will take me out.

2:44:38.500 --> 2:44:39.340
 And then you think, well,

2:44:39.340 --> 2:44:42.020
 what do you do about that objection?

2:44:42.020 --> 2:44:45.660
 And the answer is, well, you factor that in.

2:44:45.660 --> 2:44:48.740
 And that's why you're supposed to be, what is it?

2:44:48.740 --> 2:44:51.260
 As soft as a dove and as wise as a serpent.

2:44:51.260 --> 2:44:54.300
 It's like, I know you're full of snakes.

2:44:54.300 --> 2:44:55.700
 I know it.

2:44:55.700 --> 2:45:00.620
 Maybe I know it more than you do, but we'll play anyways.

2:45:00.620 --> 2:45:02.260
 And that's the risk anyway.

2:45:02.260 --> 2:45:04.220
 That's right, voluntarily, right?

2:45:04.220 --> 2:45:06.740
 It's like, and what's so cool about that

2:45:06.740 --> 2:45:08.860
 is that even though the person you're dealing with

2:45:08.860 --> 2:45:13.060
 is full of snakes, if you offer your hand in trust

2:45:13.060 --> 2:45:16.940
 and it's real, you will evoke the best in them.

2:45:16.940 --> 2:45:18.820
 And that's true even, I've dealt with people

2:45:18.820 --> 2:45:23.820
 who are pretty damn criminal and pretty psychopathic

2:45:25.220 --> 2:45:28.140
 and sometimes dangerously so.

2:45:28.140 --> 2:45:30.100
 And you tread very lightly

2:45:30.100 --> 2:45:31.660
 when you're dealing with someone like that,

2:45:31.660 --> 2:45:33.900
 especially if they're intoxicated.

2:45:33.900 --> 2:45:38.900
 And even then your best bet is that alert trust.

2:45:42.780 --> 2:45:45.420
 It's the only, it's the fact that the only thing I know

2:45:45.420 --> 2:45:49.060
 that I had one client who was a paranoid,

2:45:49.060 --> 2:45:51.140
 he was paranoid psychopath.

2:45:51.140 --> 2:45:52.980
 That's a bad combination.

2:45:52.980 --> 2:45:54.420
 He was a bad guy, man.

2:45:54.420 --> 2:45:57.940
 He had like four restraining orders on him

2:45:57.940 --> 2:46:00.180
 and restraining orders don't work on the sort of people

2:46:00.180 --> 2:46:02.860
 that you put restraining orders on.

2:46:02.860 --> 2:46:06.660
 And he used to be harassed now and then by a bureaucrat

2:46:06.660 --> 2:46:10.060
 in a bank with delusions of power.

2:46:10.060 --> 2:46:13.140
 And he would say to them, he used to kind of act this out

2:46:13.140 --> 2:46:14.860
 to me when I was talking to him.

2:46:14.860 --> 2:46:19.340
 He'd say, I'm going to be your worst nightmare.

2:46:20.300 --> 2:46:23.700
 And he meant it and he would do it.

2:46:23.700 --> 2:46:27.620
 He had this obsessional psychopathic vengeance

2:46:27.620 --> 2:46:31.420
 that was just like right there, paranoid to the hilt

2:46:31.420 --> 2:46:34.060
 and paranoid people are hyper acute.

2:46:34.060 --> 2:46:38.540
 So they're watching you for any sign of deceit

2:46:38.540 --> 2:46:41.500
 or manipulation and they're really good at it.

2:46:41.500 --> 2:46:44.380
 Cause like they're 100%, that's what paranoia is.

2:46:44.380 --> 2:46:47.100
 It's 100% focus on that.

2:46:47.100 --> 2:46:49.780
 And even under those circumstances,

2:46:49.780 --> 2:46:54.420
 if you step carefully enough, you can,

2:46:54.420 --> 2:46:57.140
 maybe you can avoid the ax.

2:46:57.140 --> 2:46:59.020
 That's a good thing to know if you ever meet someone

2:46:59.020 --> 2:47:01.580
 truly dangerous.

2:47:01.580 --> 2:47:02.660
 Absolutely.

2:47:02.660 --> 2:47:06.580
 I believe in that, that being fragile, nevertheless,

2:47:06.580 --> 2:47:09.020
 taking that leap of trust towards another person,

2:47:09.020 --> 2:47:10.140
 even when they're dangerous,

2:47:10.140 --> 2:47:12.020
 especially when they're dangerous.

2:47:12.020 --> 2:47:16.660
 If you care, if there's something there in those hills

2:47:16.660 --> 2:47:20.540
 you want to find, then that's probably the only way

2:47:20.540 --> 2:47:23.380
 you're going to find is taking that risk.

2:47:23.380 --> 2:47:28.380
 I have to ask you about Gulag Archipelago by Solzhenitsyn.

2:47:28.380 --> 2:47:30.340
 Let's speak to this very point.

2:47:30.340 --> 2:47:31.760
 There's so many layers to this book.

2:47:31.760 --> 2:47:33.980
 We could talk about it forever.

2:47:33.980 --> 2:47:38.020
 I'm sure in many ways we are talking about it forever.

2:47:38.020 --> 2:47:41.180
 But there is sort of one of the themes captured

2:47:41.180 --> 2:47:43.260
 in the few ways that was described to the book

2:47:43.260 --> 2:47:45.300
 is that line between good and evil

2:47:45.300 --> 2:47:48.560
 that runs through every human being.

2:47:48.560 --> 2:47:52.860
 As he writes, the line dividing good and evil

2:47:52.860 --> 2:47:55.400
 cuts through the heart of every human being.

2:47:55.400 --> 2:47:57.540
 During the life of any heart,

2:47:57.540 --> 2:47:59.780
 this line keeps changing place.

2:47:59.780 --> 2:48:03.540
 Sometimes it is squeezed one way to exuberant evil,

2:48:03.540 --> 2:48:06.120
 and sometimes it shifts to allow enough space

2:48:06.120 --> 2:48:07.740
 for good to flourish.

2:48:07.740 --> 2:48:10.880
 One and the same human being is, at various ages,

2:48:10.880 --> 2:48:12.720
 under various circumstances,

2:48:12.720 --> 2:48:15.020
 a totally different human being.

2:48:15.020 --> 2:48:17.600
 At times he's close to being a devil,

2:48:17.600 --> 2:48:20.040
 at times the sainthood.

2:48:20.040 --> 2:48:22.100
 But his name doesn't change,

2:48:22.100 --> 2:48:26.500
 and to that name we ascribe the whole lot, good and evil.

2:48:26.500 --> 2:48:27.740
 What do you think about this line?

2:48:27.740 --> 2:48:29.340
 What do you think about this thing

2:48:29.340 --> 2:48:31.820
 where we talked about if you give somebody a chance,

2:48:31.820 --> 2:48:33.720
 you actually bring out the best in them?

2:48:33.720 --> 2:48:36.420
 What do you think about this other aspect

2:48:36.420 --> 2:48:41.420
 that throughout time that line shifts inside each person

2:48:41.620 --> 2:48:43.660
 and you get to define that shift?

2:48:43.660 --> 2:48:45.940
 What do you think about this line?

2:48:45.940 --> 2:48:47.600
 Are we all capable of evil?

2:48:48.700 --> 2:48:50.420
 Well, you know, the cosmic drama,

2:48:50.420 --> 2:48:53.580
 that's Satan versus Christ.

2:48:53.580 --> 2:48:55.700
 It's like, well, who's that about?

2:48:55.700 --> 2:48:56.860
 If it's not about you?

2:48:59.020 --> 2:49:01.500
 I'm speaking just as a psychologist

2:49:01.500 --> 2:49:03.140
 or as a literary critic.

2:49:03.140 --> 2:49:05.780
 Those are characters, at least they're that.

2:49:06.660 --> 2:49:08.980
 Well, are they human characters?

2:49:08.980 --> 2:49:10.660
 Well, obviously.

2:49:10.660 --> 2:49:12.840
 Well, are they archetypal human characters?

2:49:13.740 --> 2:49:14.680
 Yes.

2:49:14.680 --> 2:49:18.460
 What does that mean cosmically and ontologically?

2:49:18.460 --> 2:49:19.660
 I don't know.

2:49:19.660 --> 2:49:21.060
 Like, is the world a story?

2:49:22.460 --> 2:49:23.300
 Maybe.

2:49:23.300 --> 2:49:24.640
 But the way stories are often told

2:49:24.640 --> 2:49:27.180
 is the characters embody a stable.

2:49:27.180 --> 2:49:30.420
 Those are unsophisticated, not great literature though.

2:49:30.420 --> 2:49:32.180
 It's very rare in great literature.

2:49:32.180 --> 2:49:33.940
 What you have in great literature generally

2:49:33.940 --> 2:49:35.580
 is the internal drama, right?

2:49:35.580 --> 2:49:40.580
 And as the literature becomes more pop, I would say,

2:49:40.700 --> 2:49:42.940
 the characters are more unitary.

2:49:42.940 --> 2:49:44.900
 So there's a real bad guy and he's all bad

2:49:44.900 --> 2:49:47.940
 and there's a real good guy and he's all good.

2:49:47.940 --> 2:49:49.660
 And that's not as interesting.

2:49:49.660 --> 2:49:51.500
 It's not as sophisticated.

2:49:51.500 --> 2:49:55.460
 When you reach Dostoevskian heights in literary representation

2:49:55.460 --> 2:50:00.460
 or Shakespearean heights, you can identify with the villain.

2:50:01.900 --> 2:50:05.420
 And that's when literature really reaches its pinnacle

2:50:05.420 --> 2:50:06.500
 in some sense.

2:50:06.500 --> 2:50:08.700
 And also the characters change throughout.

2:50:08.700 --> 2:50:09.540
 They shift throughout.

2:50:09.540 --> 2:50:11.340
 They're unpredictable throughout.

2:50:11.340 --> 2:50:14.540
 Taking the speaking of Russian more seriously recently.

2:50:14.540 --> 2:50:17.900
 And I've gotten to talk to translators of Dostoevsk and Tolstoy

2:50:17.900 --> 2:50:22.180
 and Cherkov and those kinds of folks.

2:50:22.180 --> 2:50:25.980
 And you get the, one of the mistakes that translators made

2:50:25.980 --> 2:50:28.380
 with Dostoevsky for the longest time

2:50:28.380 --> 2:50:33.260
 is they would, quote unquote, fix the chaotic mess

2:50:33.260 --> 2:50:37.040
 that is Dostoevsky because there was a sense

2:50:37.040 --> 2:50:39.960
 like he was too rushed in his writing.

2:50:39.960 --> 2:50:41.660
 It seemed like there was tangents

2:50:41.660 --> 2:50:43.580
 that had nothing to do with anything.

2:50:43.580 --> 2:50:46.580
 The characters were unpredictable and not inconsistent.

2:50:46.580 --> 2:50:49.460
 There's parts of phrases that seem to be incomplete,

2:50:49.460 --> 2:50:50.500
 that kind of stuff.

2:50:50.500 --> 2:50:53.100
 And what they realize that is, that's not,

2:50:53.100 --> 2:50:55.260
 that's actually crafted that way.

2:50:55.260 --> 2:50:58.580
 It's not, it's like editing James Joyce,

2:50:58.580 --> 2:51:00.020
 like Finnegan's Wake or something

2:51:00.020 --> 2:51:01.740
 because it doesn't make any sense.

2:51:01.740 --> 2:51:03.700
 They realize that that is the magic of it.

2:51:03.700 --> 2:51:05.960
 That captures the humanity of these characters,

2:51:05.960 --> 2:51:07.100
 that they are unpredictable.

2:51:07.100 --> 2:51:08.780
 They change throughout time.

2:51:08.780 --> 2:51:11.220
 There's a bunch of contradictions.

2:51:11.220 --> 2:51:13.900
 On which point I gotta ask, is there a case to be made

2:51:13.900 --> 2:51:17.940
 that Brothers Karamazov is the greatest book I've ever written?

2:51:17.940 --> 2:51:20.180
 Yeah, there is a case to be made for that.

2:51:20.180 --> 2:51:23.020
 I don't know, is it better than Crime and Punishment?

2:51:23.020 --> 2:51:23.980
 Yes, yeah.

2:51:23.980 --> 2:51:24.860
 You think so?

2:51:24.860 --> 2:51:26.740
 Why do you, I'm not arguing with it.

2:51:26.740 --> 2:51:28.060
 Why do you think that?

2:51:28.060 --> 2:51:30.420
 Well, every book is a person.

2:51:30.420 --> 2:51:32.740
 Some of my best friends are inside that book.

2:51:32.740 --> 2:51:34.060
 Yeah, it's an amazing book.

2:51:34.060 --> 2:51:35.660
 I mean, there's no doubt about it.

2:51:35.660 --> 2:51:39.900
 I think it's, some books are defined

2:51:39.900 --> 2:51:41.340
 by your personal relationship with them.

2:51:41.340 --> 2:51:44.620
 That one was definitive, and I almost graduated to that one

2:51:44.620 --> 2:51:46.540
 because for the longest time,

2:51:46.540 --> 2:51:51.300
 The Idiot was my favorite book of all,

2:51:51.300 --> 2:51:53.980
 because I identified with the ideas

2:51:53.980 --> 2:51:55.620
 represented by Prince Mishkin.

2:51:55.620 --> 2:51:56.660
 I also identified.

2:51:56.660 --> 2:51:58.140
 Ah, that's interesting.

2:51:58.140 --> 2:52:00.500
 To Prince Mishkin as a human being.

2:52:00.500 --> 2:52:01.540
 The holy fool.

2:52:01.540 --> 2:52:04.500
 The fool, yeah, because the world kind of,

2:52:04.500 --> 2:52:07.260
 my whole life still kind of sees me,

2:52:07.260 --> 2:52:08.620
 saw me in my perception.

2:52:08.620 --> 2:52:12.820
 My narrow perception is kind of the fool.

2:52:12.820 --> 2:52:17.620
 And I, different from the interpretation

2:52:17.620 --> 2:52:19.860
 that a lot of people take of this book,

2:52:19.860 --> 2:52:22.180
 I see him as a kind of hero to be.

2:52:22.180 --> 2:52:23.020
 Oh, definitely.

2:52:23.020 --> 2:52:26.780
 To be a naive, quote unquote, fool,

2:52:26.780 --> 2:52:29.900
 but really just a naive optimist,

2:52:29.900 --> 2:52:31.780
 and naive in the best possible way.

2:52:31.780 --> 2:52:33.180
 I do believe that.

2:52:33.180 --> 2:52:34.540
 That's childlike?

2:52:34.540 --> 2:52:36.260
 Yeah, childlike is a better.

2:52:36.260 --> 2:52:38.460
 So naive is usually seen as.

2:52:38.460 --> 2:52:39.700
 That's childish, naive.

2:52:39.700 --> 2:52:42.660
 Yeah, but childlike.

2:52:42.660 --> 2:52:45.340
 That's why no one enters the kingdom of heaven

2:52:45.340 --> 2:52:48.060
 unless they become like a child.

2:52:48.060 --> 2:52:49.260
 That's Prince Mishkin.

2:52:49.260 --> 2:52:50.980
 Dostoevsky knew that.

2:52:50.980 --> 2:52:52.340
 So that's why he liked The Idiot.

2:52:52.340 --> 2:52:53.700
 That's so interesting.

2:52:53.700 --> 2:52:55.420
 See, I think I like Crime and Punishment

2:52:55.420 --> 2:52:57.260
 because while you identified with Mishkin,

2:52:57.260 --> 2:52:59.780
 I think I identified more with Raskolnikov

2:52:59.780 --> 2:53:02.060
 because I was tempted by a Luciferian intellect,

2:53:02.060 --> 2:53:06.220
 you know, in a manner very similar

2:53:06.220 --> 2:53:07.820
 to the manner he was tempted.

2:53:07.820 --> 2:53:10.540
 But I mean, I think you can make a case

2:53:10.540 --> 2:53:13.340
 that the Brothers Karamazov is Dostoevsky's

2:53:13.340 --> 2:53:15.140
 crowning achievement.

2:53:15.140 --> 2:53:15.980
 Well.

2:53:15.980 --> 2:53:16.940
 And that's something, man.

2:53:16.940 --> 2:53:18.540
 He ruined literature for me.

2:53:20.300 --> 2:53:22.660
 Because everything else just felt insipid afterwards.

2:53:22.660 --> 2:53:24.060
 Not everything.

2:53:24.060 --> 2:53:25.420
 Not everything.

2:53:25.420 --> 2:53:29.940
 I found some books that in my experience

2:53:29.940 --> 2:53:31.940
 hit that pinnacle.

2:53:31.940 --> 2:53:33.300
 The Master and Margarita.

2:53:34.220 --> 2:53:35.380
 That's a deadly book.

2:53:35.380 --> 2:53:36.900
 I've read that I think four times,

2:53:36.900 --> 2:53:40.060
 and I still, there's still, it's unbelievably deep.

2:53:41.060 --> 2:53:43.460
 There's a Nikos Kazantzakis, a Greek writer.

2:53:44.420 --> 2:53:45.700
 Some of his books are,

2:53:46.940 --> 2:53:48.860
 his writing is amazing as well.

2:53:48.860 --> 2:53:50.860
 Did you ever connect with the literary,

2:53:50.860 --> 2:53:55.820
 like existentialist Camus or people like Hermann Hesse

2:53:55.820 --> 2:53:59.060
 or even Kafka?

2:53:59.060 --> 2:54:00.340
 Did you ever connect with those?

2:54:00.340 --> 2:54:01.340
 To the same degree?

2:54:01.340 --> 2:54:02.180
 Yeah, to the same.

2:54:02.180 --> 2:54:03.620
 Enough to be an influence.

2:54:03.620 --> 2:54:07.300
 You know, you have to be deaf in some fundamental sense

2:54:07.300 --> 2:54:12.020
 not to encounters a great dead friend and fail to learn.

2:54:12.020 --> 2:54:14.700
 No, and I mean, I tried to separate the wheat

2:54:14.700 --> 2:54:16.420
 from the chaff when I read.

2:54:16.420 --> 2:54:18.340
 You know, and I read all the great clinicians,

2:54:18.340 --> 2:54:20.180
 all of them, perhaps not.

2:54:21.820 --> 2:54:24.180
 Those who are foremost in the pantheon.

2:54:24.180 --> 2:54:25.980
 And I tried to pull out what I could,

2:54:25.980 --> 2:54:26.900
 and that was a lot.

2:54:26.900 --> 2:54:28.260
 I learned a lot from Freud.

2:54:28.260 --> 2:54:30.100
 I learned a lot from Rogers.

2:54:30.100 --> 2:54:31.380
 And I learned a lot from, well,

2:54:31.380 --> 2:54:32.860
 from Dostoevsky and Nietzsche.

2:54:32.860 --> 2:54:35.100
 I'm gonna do a course on Dostoevsky and Nietzsche

2:54:35.100 --> 2:54:36.460
 for this Peterson Academy.

2:54:36.460 --> 2:54:38.260
 This is coming up in January.

2:54:38.260 --> 2:54:40.020
 Oh, that'll be them together.

2:54:40.020 --> 2:54:40.860
 I'm really looking forward to it.

2:54:40.860 --> 2:54:43.100
 You're weaving, I mean.

2:54:43.100 --> 2:54:44.700
 I hadn't thought about doing them together.

2:54:44.700 --> 2:54:45.540
 Oh.

2:54:45.540 --> 2:54:46.380
 That'd be fun.

2:54:46.380 --> 2:54:47.220
 That's a good idea.

2:54:47.220 --> 2:54:48.060
 That'd be a good idea.

2:54:48.060 --> 2:54:50.020
 Well, there's an interesting.

2:54:50.020 --> 2:54:51.380
 I'm gonna steal that idea.

2:54:51.380 --> 2:54:52.220
 I don't know.

2:54:52.220 --> 2:54:54.420
 You often weave them together really masterfully

2:54:54.420 --> 2:54:59.420
 because there is religious in the broad sense

2:54:59.740 --> 2:55:02.060
 of that word, themes throughout the writing.

2:55:02.060 --> 2:55:03.620
 Throughout the writing of both.

2:55:03.620 --> 2:55:05.660
 Yeah, well, there's uncanny parallelisms

2:55:05.660 --> 2:55:07.900
 in their writing and their lives.

2:55:07.900 --> 2:55:12.180
 So, and Dostoevsky's deeper than Nietzsche,

2:55:12.180 --> 2:55:15.580
 but that's because he was a writer of fiction.

2:55:15.580 --> 2:55:18.060
 Nietzsche is almost a character in a Dostoevsky book.

2:55:18.060 --> 2:55:19.620
 He is definitely that.

2:55:19.620 --> 2:55:21.380
 He is definitely that, yes.

2:55:22.340 --> 2:55:24.820
 And apparently Nietzsche knew more about Dostoevsky

2:55:24.820 --> 2:55:25.740
 than people had thought.

2:55:25.740 --> 2:55:27.940
 There's been some recent scholarship on that grounds.

2:55:27.940 --> 2:55:29.780
 Dostoevsky didn't know anything about Nietzsche

2:55:29.780 --> 2:55:30.900
 as far as I know.

2:55:30.900 --> 2:55:32.340
 I could be wrong about that.

2:55:32.340 --> 2:55:35.340
 But the thing that Dostoevsky had over Nietzsche

2:55:35.340 --> 2:55:37.660
 is Nietzsche had to make things propositional

2:55:37.660 --> 2:55:39.500
 in some real sense, cause he was a philosopher.

2:55:39.500 --> 2:55:42.420
 And it's hard to propositionalize things

2:55:42.420 --> 2:55:46.460
 that are outside your ken, but you can characterize them.

2:55:46.460 --> 2:55:49.340
 And so in the Brothers Karamazov,

2:55:49.340 --> 2:55:54.180
 Ivan is a more developed character than Eleosha.

2:55:54.180 --> 2:55:58.060
 In the explicit sense, he can make better arguments.

2:55:58.060 --> 2:56:02.820
 But Eleosha wins, like Mishkin, because he's the better man.

2:56:02.820 --> 2:56:05.820
 And Dostoevsky can show that in the actions.

2:56:06.860 --> 2:56:08.780
 He can't render it entirely propositional,

2:56:08.780 --> 2:56:10.220
 but that's probably because what's good

2:56:10.220 --> 2:56:12.700
 can't be rendered entirely propositional.

2:56:12.700 --> 2:56:14.820
 And so Dostoevsky had that edge over Nietzsche.

2:56:14.820 --> 2:56:17.420
 He said, well, Ivan is this brilliant rationalist,

2:56:17.420 --> 2:56:21.460
 atheist, materialist, and puts forward an argument

2:56:21.460 --> 2:56:23.420
 on that front that's still unparalleled

2:56:23.420 --> 2:56:25.020
 as far as I'm concerned.

2:56:25.020 --> 2:56:27.980
 And overwhelms Eleosha, who cannot respond

2:56:27.980 --> 2:56:30.820
 but Eleosha's still the better man.

2:56:30.820 --> 2:56:33.740
 So, which is very interesting, you know, that.

2:56:33.740 --> 2:56:35.820
 You know, the funny thing about those two characters

2:56:35.820 --> 2:56:39.580
 is you, Jordan Peterson, seem to be somebody

2:56:39.580 --> 2:56:42.500
 that at least in part embodies both.

2:56:42.500 --> 2:56:45.660
 Because you are one of the intellectuals of our time,

2:56:45.660 --> 2:56:49.540
 rigorous in thought, but also are able

2:56:49.540 --> 2:56:52.740
 to have that kind of, what would you describe?

2:56:52.740 --> 2:56:55.980
 If you remove the religiosity of Eleosha,

2:56:55.980 --> 2:56:59.700
 there's a, what's a good word?

2:56:59.700 --> 2:57:00.860
 Love towards the world.

2:57:00.860 --> 2:57:02.940
 Spirit of encouragement.

2:57:02.940 --> 2:57:04.420
 Yes.

2:57:04.420 --> 2:57:05.260
 Which one?

2:57:05.260 --> 2:57:06.700
 Yeah, well, it's, you know, one of the things

2:57:06.700 --> 2:57:10.180
 I did learn, perhaps, from looking into the abyss

2:57:10.180 --> 2:57:14.780
 to the degree that I have had to, or was willing to,

2:57:16.060 --> 2:57:17.940
 was that at some level you have to make

2:57:17.940 --> 2:57:20.500
 a fundamental statement of faith.

2:57:20.500 --> 2:57:23.020
 When God creates the world, after each day,

2:57:23.020 --> 2:57:26.540
 He says, He saw that it was good.

2:57:26.540 --> 2:57:28.100
 You think, well, is it good?

2:57:28.100 --> 2:57:29.900
 It's like, well, there's a tough question.

2:57:29.900 --> 2:57:31.740
 I mean, you know, do you want to bring a child

2:57:31.740 --> 2:57:35.020
 into a world such as this, which is a fundamental question

2:57:35.020 --> 2:57:36.380
 of whether or not it's good.

2:57:38.020 --> 2:57:41.220
 It's an act of faith to declare that it's good

2:57:41.220 --> 2:57:43.140
 because the evidence is ambivalent.

2:57:44.380 --> 2:57:46.300
 And so then you think, okay, well,

2:57:47.900 --> 2:57:49.500
 am I gonna act as if it's good?

2:57:49.500 --> 2:57:51.700
 And what would happen if I did?

2:57:51.700 --> 2:57:55.380
 And maybe the answer to that is, I think this is the answer.

2:58:02.100 --> 2:58:06.780
 The more you act out the proposition that it's good,

2:58:06.780 --> 2:58:07.860
 the better it gets.

2:58:09.620 --> 2:58:10.460
 And so that's it.

2:58:10.460 --> 2:58:13.300
 Dostoevsky said, this is something else.

2:58:13.300 --> 2:58:16.100
 Every man is not only responsible for everything he does,

2:58:16.100 --> 2:58:18.100
 but for everything everyone else does.

2:58:18.100 --> 2:58:23.020
 It's like, what is that profound, or are you just insane?

2:58:23.020 --> 2:58:28.020
 Then you think, is what you receive back proportionate

2:58:28.020 --> 2:58:28.940
 to what you deliver?

2:58:30.060 --> 2:58:32.580
 And the answer to that might be yes.

2:58:32.580 --> 2:58:34.860
 That's a terrifying idea, man.

2:58:34.860 --> 2:58:37.500
 And it's certainly, you can see that it's true in some sense

2:58:37.500 --> 2:58:42.500
 because people certainly respond to you in kind

2:58:42.500 --> 2:58:43.820
 with how you treat them.

2:58:43.820 --> 2:58:44.980
 That's certainly the case.

2:58:44.980 --> 2:58:48.220
 I mean, it's terrifying and it's exciting.

2:58:48.220 --> 2:58:49.060
 Yeah, right.

2:58:49.940 --> 2:58:51.180
 But that's an adventure, isn't it?

2:58:51.180 --> 2:58:56.180
 You, yeah, you create the world by the way you live it.

2:58:59.340 --> 2:59:02.100
 The world you experience is defined by the way

2:59:02.100 --> 2:59:03.340
 you live that world.

2:59:03.340 --> 2:59:05.180
 And that's really interesting.

2:59:05.180 --> 2:59:06.740
 And then taken as a collective,

2:59:06.740 --> 2:59:09.140
 we create the world together in that way.

2:59:09.140 --> 2:59:11.180
 What do you think is the meaning of it all?

2:59:11.180 --> 2:59:13.540
 What's the meaning of life, Jordan Peterson?

2:59:13.540 --> 2:59:16.100
 You've, we've defined it many, many times

2:59:16.100 --> 2:59:16.940
 throughout this conversation.

2:59:16.940 --> 2:59:18.900
 It's the adventure along the route, man.

2:59:20.300 --> 2:59:24.900
 And I would say, where's that adventure to be found?

2:59:24.900 --> 2:59:26.140
 In faith?

2:59:26.140 --> 2:59:27.780
 What's the faith?

2:59:27.780 --> 2:59:30.780
 The highest value is love and truth is its handmaiden.

2:59:33.180 --> 2:59:34.700
 That's a statement of faith, right?

2:59:34.700 --> 2:59:36.140
 Because you can't tell.

2:59:37.500 --> 2:59:40.780
 You have to act it out to see if it's true.

2:59:40.780 --> 2:59:41.620
 Yeah.

2:59:41.620 --> 2:59:43.540
 If it's true. Yeah.

2:59:43.540 --> 2:59:46.260
 And so you can't even find out without,

2:59:46.260 --> 2:59:47.820
 and that's so peculiar.

2:59:47.820 --> 2:59:50.340
 You have to make the commitment a priori.

2:59:50.340 --> 2:59:51.540
 Yeah. It's like a marriage.

2:59:51.540 --> 2:59:52.620
 It's the same thing.

2:59:53.540 --> 2:59:56.420
 It's like, well, is this the person for me?

2:59:56.420 --> 2:59:57.980
 Oh, that's the wrong question.

2:59:59.340 --> 3:00:01.740
 How do I find out if this is the person for me?

3:00:02.900 --> 3:00:05.180
 By binding myself to them.

3:00:07.060 --> 3:00:09.180
 Well, maybe the same thing is true of life, right?

3:00:09.180 --> 3:00:10.580
 You bind yourself to it.

3:00:10.580 --> 3:00:12.540
 And the tighter you bind yourself to it,

3:00:12.540 --> 3:00:14.740
 the more you find out what it is.

3:00:14.740 --> 3:00:17.180
 And that's like a radical embrace.

3:00:17.180 --> 3:00:19.180
 And it's a really radical embrace.

3:00:19.180 --> 3:00:20.460
 That's the crucifix symbol.

3:00:20.460 --> 3:00:22.820
 And more than that, because like I said,

3:00:22.820 --> 3:00:26.300
 the full passion story isn't death.

3:00:26.300 --> 3:00:28.460
 It isn't even unjust death.

3:00:28.460 --> 3:00:30.620
 It isn't even unjust death

3:00:30.620 --> 3:00:33.340
 and the crucifixion of the innocent,

3:00:33.340 --> 3:00:35.580
 which is really getting pretty bad.

3:00:35.580 --> 3:00:40.580
 It's unjust, torturous, innocent death,

3:00:42.220 --> 3:00:46.500
 attendant upon betrayal and tyranny, followed by hell.

3:00:47.460 --> 3:00:50.660
 Well, that's a hell of a thing to radically embrace.

3:00:50.660 --> 3:00:51.740
 It's like, bring it on.

3:00:53.380 --> 3:00:57.980
 I think a lot of people put truth as the highest ideal

3:00:57.980 --> 3:01:02.980
 and think they can get to that ideal

3:01:02.980 --> 3:01:05.900
 while living in a place of cynicism

3:01:05.900 --> 3:01:07.700
 and ultimately escape from life

3:01:07.700 --> 3:01:10.020
 and hiding from life, afraid of life.

3:01:10.020 --> 3:01:13.940
 And it's beautifully put that love

3:01:13.940 --> 3:01:18.100
 is the highest ideal to reach for and truth is.

3:01:18.100 --> 3:01:19.420
 It's handmade.

3:01:19.420 --> 3:01:21.060
 I thought about that for a long time, right?

3:01:21.060 --> 3:01:22.980
 This hierarchy of ideal.

3:01:22.980 --> 3:01:25.100
 And the thing about truth, that bitter truth,

3:01:25.100 --> 3:01:26.540
 let's say, that cynical truth,

3:01:26.540 --> 3:01:31.140
 is it can break the shackles of naivety.

3:01:31.140 --> 3:01:34.420
 And actually a burnt cynicism

3:01:34.420 --> 3:01:38.900
 is a moral improvement over a blind naivety.

3:01:39.900 --> 3:01:42.540
 Even though one is in some ways positive,

3:01:42.540 --> 3:01:44.180
 but only because it's protected.

3:01:44.180 --> 3:01:48.060
 And the other is bitter and dark, but still better.

3:01:48.060 --> 3:01:49.500
 But you're not done at that point.

3:01:49.500 --> 3:01:51.340
 You're just barely started.

3:01:51.340 --> 3:01:53.100
 It's like, you're cynical?

3:01:53.100 --> 3:01:54.460
 You're not cynical enough.

3:01:55.500 --> 3:01:57.060
 It's like, how cynical are you?

3:01:57.060 --> 3:02:01.420
 Are you, I'm an Auschwitz prison guard level of cynical?

3:02:01.420 --> 3:02:03.460
 Because you have to be,

3:02:03.460 --> 3:02:05.580
 you have to go down pretty deep into the weeds

3:02:05.580 --> 3:02:07.220
 before you find that part of you.

3:02:07.220 --> 3:02:09.420
 But you can find it if you want.

3:02:09.420 --> 3:02:11.820
 And then you think, well, I want to stop this.

3:02:13.060 --> 3:02:14.420
 Well, that was the question you posed.

3:02:14.420 --> 3:02:15.860
 In some sense, you're obsessed with,

3:02:15.860 --> 3:02:19.860
 say, what happened on these mass scale catastrophes

3:02:19.860 --> 3:02:21.380
 in the communist countries.

3:02:21.380 --> 3:02:24.740
 It's like, well, millions of people participated.

3:02:24.740 --> 3:02:28.100
 So you could have, and maybe you would have enjoyed it.

3:02:28.100 --> 3:02:30.140
 So what part of that is you?

3:02:30.140 --> 3:02:32.700
 And you can find it if you want.

3:02:33.980 --> 3:02:35.420
 Yeah, it's all there.

3:02:35.420 --> 3:02:39.100
 The prisoner, the interrogator, the Judas.

3:02:40.140 --> 3:02:41.940
 Pontius Pilate.

3:02:41.940 --> 3:02:42.780
 All of it.

3:02:42.780 --> 3:02:43.620
 All of it, yeah.

3:02:43.620 --> 3:02:45.420
 And all of it is inside us.

3:02:45.420 --> 3:02:46.260
 Yeah.

3:02:46.260 --> 3:02:48.100
 And you just have to look.

3:02:48.100 --> 3:02:51.940
 And once you do, maybe eventually you can find the love.

3:02:51.940 --> 3:02:53.860
 Jordan, you're an incredible human being.

3:02:53.860 --> 3:02:56.460
 I'm deeply honored you would talk to me.

3:02:56.460 --> 3:02:59.220
 Thank you for being a truth seeker in this world.

3:02:59.220 --> 3:03:01.020
 And thank you for the love.

3:03:01.020 --> 3:03:03.540

3:03:13.220 --> 3:03:14.540
 from Friedrich Nietzsche.

3:03:15.540 --> 3:03:17.620
 You must have chaos within you

3:03:17.620 --> 3:03:19.900
 to give birth to a dancing star.

3:03:20.980 --> 3:03:23.220
