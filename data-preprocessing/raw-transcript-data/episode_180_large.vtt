00:00.000 --> 00:02.920
 The following is a conversation with Jeremy Suri,

00:02.920 --> 00:05.320
 a historian at UT Austin,

00:05.320 --> 00:07.640
 whose research interests and writing

00:07.640 --> 00:10.000
 are on modern American history

00:10.000 --> 00:11.760
 with an eye towards presidents

00:11.760 --> 00:15.200
 and in general individuals who wielded power.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.000
 Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
 Element, Monk Pack, Belcampo, Four Sigmatic, and Eight Sleep.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.680
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:26.680 --> 00:30.100
 As a side note, let me say that in these conversations,

00:30.100 --> 00:34.480
 for better or worse, I seek understanding, not activism.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.720
 I'm not left nor right.

00:36.720 --> 00:39.240
 I love ideas, not labels.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.960
 And most fascinating ideas are full of uncertainty,

00:41.960 --> 00:43.720
 tension, and trade offs.

00:43.720 --> 00:45.520
 Labels destroy that.

00:45.520 --> 00:48.420
 I try ideas out, let them breathe for a time,

00:48.420 --> 00:51.080
 try to challenge, explore, and analyze.

00:51.080 --> 00:54.840
 But mostly, I trust the intelligence of you, the listener,

00:54.840 --> 00:58.680
 to think and to make up your own mind, together with me.

00:58.680 --> 01:02.200
 I will try to have economists and philosophers on

01:02.200 --> 01:06.000
 from all points on the multidimensional political spectrum,

01:06.000 --> 01:08.040
 including the extremes.

01:08.040 --> 01:10.160
 I will try to both have an open mind

01:10.160 --> 01:12.600
 and to ask difficult questions when needed.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.200
 I'll make mistakes.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.920
 Don't shoot this robot at the first sign of failure.

01:16.920 --> 01:18.620
 I'm still under development.

01:18.620 --> 01:21.400
 Pre release version 0.1.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.480
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast,

01:23.480 --> 01:26.600
 and here is my conversation with Jeremy Suri.

01:27.480 --> 01:31.000
 You've studied many American presidents throughout history,

01:31.000 --> 01:34.480
 so who do you think was the greatest president

01:34.480 --> 01:35.920
 in American history?

01:35.920 --> 01:38.780
 The greatest American president was Abraham Lincoln.

01:38.780 --> 01:42.720
 And Tolstoy reflected on this himself, actually,

01:42.720 --> 01:45.120
 saying that when he was in the caucuses,

01:45.120 --> 01:48.960
 he asked these peasants in the caucuses

01:48.960 --> 01:51.400
 who was the greatest man in the world that they had heard of,

01:51.400 --> 01:53.200
 and they said Abraham Lincoln.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.680
 And why?

01:54.680 --> 01:57.000
 Well, because he gave voice to people

01:57.000 --> 01:58.880
 who had no voice before.

01:58.880 --> 02:00.680
 He turned politics into an art.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.180
 This is what Tolstoy recounted,

02:02.180 --> 02:04.720
 the peasants in the caucuses telling him.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.280
 Lincoln made politics more than about power.

02:07.280 --> 02:08.440
 He made it an art.

02:08.440 --> 02:10.760
 He made it a source of liberation.

02:10.760 --> 02:13.240
 And those living even far from the United States

02:13.240 --> 02:17.880
 could see that model, that inspiration from Lincoln.

02:17.880 --> 02:20.680
 He was a man who had two years of education,

02:20.680 --> 02:22.680
 yet he mastered the English language,

02:22.680 --> 02:24.640
 and he used the language

02:24.640 --> 02:27.760
 to help people imagine a different kind of world.

02:27.760 --> 02:30.500
 You see, leaders and presidents are at their best

02:30.500 --> 02:31.440
 when they're doing more

02:31.440 --> 02:34.000
 than just manipulating institutions and power,

02:34.000 --> 02:36.520
 when they're helping the people imagine a better world.

02:36.520 --> 02:40.400
 And he did that as no other president has.

02:40.400 --> 02:43.980
 And you say he gave voice to those who are voiceless.

02:43.980 --> 02:46.400
 Who are you talking to about in general?

02:46.400 --> 02:47.680
 Is this about African Americans,

02:47.680 --> 02:50.880
 or is this about just the populace in general?

02:50.880 --> 02:54.640
 Certainly part of it is about slaves, African Americans,

02:54.640 --> 02:56.360
 and many immigrants,

02:56.360 --> 02:59.120
 immigrants from all parts of Europe and other areas

02:59.120 --> 03:00.720
 that have come to the United States.

03:00.720 --> 03:03.240
 But part of it was just for ordinary American citizens.

03:03.240 --> 03:04.480
 The Republican Party,

03:04.480 --> 03:06.520
 for which Lincoln was the first president,

03:06.520 --> 03:11.040
 was a party created to give voice to poor white men,

03:11.040 --> 03:13.600
 as well as slaves and others.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.920
 And Lincoln was a poor white man himself,

03:15.920 --> 03:17.840
 grew up without slaves and without land,

03:17.840 --> 03:20.120
 which meant you had almost nothing.

03:20.120 --> 03:22.020
 What do you think about the trajectory of that man

03:22.020 --> 03:23.960
 with only two years of education?

03:24.880 --> 03:26.040
 Is there something to be said

03:26.040 --> 03:28.640
 about how does one come from nothing

03:28.640 --> 03:33.640
 and nurture the ideals that kind of make this country great

03:36.080 --> 03:38.800
 into something where you can actually be a leader

03:38.800 --> 03:41.080
 of this nation to espouse those ideas,

03:41.080 --> 03:43.600
 to give the voice to the voiceless?

03:43.600 --> 03:46.340
 Yes, I think you actually hit the nail on the head.

03:46.340 --> 03:50.640
 I think what he represented was the opportunity,

03:50.640 --> 03:52.160
 and that was the word that mattered for him,

03:52.160 --> 03:57.080
 opportunity that came from the ability to raise yourself up,

03:57.080 --> 04:00.360
 to work hard, and to be compensated for your hard work.

04:00.360 --> 04:02.360
 And this is at the core of the Republican Party

04:02.360 --> 04:05.880
 of the 19th century, which is the core of capitalism.

04:05.880 --> 04:07.200
 It's not about getting rich.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.400
 It's about getting compensated for your work.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.800
 It's about being incentivized to do better work.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.440
 And Lincoln was constantly striving.

04:13.440 --> 04:17.200
 One of his closest associates, Herndon, said,

04:17.200 --> 04:20.000
 he was the little engine of ambition that couldn't stop.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.080
 He just kept going, taught himself to read,

04:23.080 --> 04:24.240
 taught himself to be a lawyer.

04:24.240 --> 04:25.620
 He went through many failed businesses

04:25.620 --> 04:28.660
 before he even reached that point, many failed love affairs.

04:29.640 --> 04:31.400
 But he kept trying, he kept working,

04:31.400 --> 04:33.440
 and what American society offered him,

04:33.440 --> 04:36.040
 and what he wanted American society to offer everyone else

04:36.040 --> 04:38.760
 was the opportunity to keep trying to fail

04:38.760 --> 04:40.680
 and then get up and try again.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.680
 What do you think was the nature of that ambition?

04:42.680 --> 04:44.240
 Was there a hunger for power?

04:44.240 --> 04:46.760
 I think Lincoln had a hunger for success.

04:46.760 --> 04:50.320
 I think he had a hunger to get out

04:50.320 --> 04:52.400
 of the poor station he was in.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.040
 He had a hunger to be someone

04:54.040 --> 04:56.040
 who had control over his life.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.620
 Freedom for him did not mean the right

04:58.620 --> 05:00.520
 to do anything you wanna do,

05:00.520 --> 05:02.480
 but it meant the right to be secure

05:02.480 --> 05:05.120
 from being dependent upon someone else.

05:05.120 --> 05:08.080
 So independence, he writes in his letters

05:08.080 --> 05:10.320
 when he's very young that he hated

05:10.320 --> 05:11.680
 being dependent on his father.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.480
 He grew up without a mother.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.280
 His father was a struggling farmer,

05:15.280 --> 05:16.680
 and he would write in his letters

05:16.680 --> 05:19.240
 that his father treated him like a slave on the farm.

05:19.240 --> 05:22.640
 Some think his hatred of slavery came from that experience.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.240
 He didn't ever wanna have to work for someone again.

05:25.240 --> 05:26.880
 He wanted to be free and independent,

05:26.880 --> 05:28.240
 and he wanted, again, every American,

05:28.240 --> 05:30.480
 this is the kind of Jeffersonian dream,

05:30.480 --> 05:34.000
 to be the owner of themself and the owner of their future.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.100
 You know, that's a really nice definition of freedom.

05:36.100 --> 05:39.160
 We often think kind of this very abstract notion

05:39.160 --> 05:41.480
 of being able to do anything you want,

05:41.480 --> 05:43.920
 but really, it's ultimately breaking yourself free

05:43.920 --> 05:48.880
 from the constraints, like the very tight dependence

05:48.880 --> 05:53.880
 on whether it's the institutions or on your family

05:54.040 --> 05:57.480
 or the expectations or the community or whatever,

05:57.480 --> 06:01.320
 being able to be, to realize yourself

06:01.320 --> 06:03.720
 within the constraints of your own abilities.

06:03.720 --> 06:05.680
 It's still not true freedom,

06:05.680 --> 06:08.100
 because true freedom is probably sort of

06:08.100 --> 06:09.880
 almost like designing a video game character,

06:09.880 --> 06:11.000
 something like that.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.920
 I agree, I think that's exactly right.

06:13.920 --> 06:18.920
 I think freedom is not that I can have any outcome I want.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.320
 I can't control outcomes.

06:20.320 --> 06:21.900
 The most powerful, freest person in the world

06:21.900 --> 06:23.480
 cannot control outcomes,

06:23.480 --> 06:25.320
 but it means at least I get to make choices.

06:25.320 --> 06:27.620
 Someone else doesn't make those choices for me.

06:29.040 --> 06:32.120
 Is there something to be said about Lincoln

06:32.120 --> 06:36.040
 on the political game front of it,

06:36.040 --> 06:38.480
 which is he's accomplished some of them?

06:38.480 --> 06:40.360
 I don't know, but it seems like

06:40.360 --> 06:42.680
 there was some tricky politics going on.

06:42.680 --> 06:44.480
 We tend to not think of it in those terms

06:44.480 --> 06:48.600
 because of the dark aspects of slavery.

06:48.600 --> 06:51.800
 We tend to think about it in sort of ethical and human terms,

06:51.800 --> 06:55.740
 but in their time, it was probably

06:55.740 --> 06:58.540
 as much a game of politics,

06:58.540 --> 07:02.200
 not just these broad questions of human nature, right?

07:02.200 --> 07:03.280
 It was a game.

07:03.280 --> 07:04.440
 So is there something to be said

07:04.440 --> 07:07.040
 about being a skillful player in the game of politics

07:07.040 --> 07:08.320
 that you take from Lincoln?

07:08.320 --> 07:12.320
 Absolutely, and Lincoln never read Karl von Clausewitz,

07:12.320 --> 07:14.200
 the great 19th century German thinker

07:14.200 --> 07:15.440
 on strategy and politics,

07:15.440 --> 07:17.240
 but he embodied the same wisdom,

07:17.240 --> 07:18.800
 which is that everything is politics.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.080
 If you want to get anything done,

07:21.080 --> 07:23.760
 and this includes even relationships,

07:23.760 --> 07:24.840
 there's a politics to it.

07:24.840 --> 07:25.680
 What does that mean?

07:25.680 --> 07:29.240
 It means that you have to persuade, coerce,

07:29.240 --> 07:32.280
 encourage people to do things they wouldn't otherwise do.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.640
 And Lincoln was a master at that.

07:34.640 --> 07:36.080
 He was a master at that for two reasons.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.760
 He had learned through his hard life to read people,

07:38.760 --> 07:41.280
 to anticipate them, to spend a lot of time listening.

07:41.280 --> 07:43.600
 One thing I often tell people

07:43.600 --> 07:47.560
 is the best leaders are the listeners, not the talkers.

07:47.560 --> 07:50.640
 And then second, Lincoln was very thoughtful

07:50.640 --> 07:52.480
 and planned every move out.

07:52.480 --> 07:54.240
 He was thinking three or four moves,

07:54.240 --> 07:56.520
 maybe five moves down the chessboard,

07:56.520 --> 07:59.200
 while others were move number one or two.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.600
 That's fascinating to think about him just listening,

08:02.600 --> 08:03.520
 just studying.

08:03.520 --> 08:06.720
 They look at great fighters in this way,

08:06.720 --> 08:10.320
 like the first few rounds of boxing and mixed martial arts,

08:10.320 --> 08:12.520
 you're studying the movement of your opponent

08:13.560 --> 08:16.560
 in order to sort of define the holes.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.600
 That's a really interesting frame to think about it.

08:18.600 --> 08:22.600
 Is there, in terms of relationships,

08:23.680 --> 08:28.440
 where do you think as president or as a politician

08:28.440 --> 08:30.040
 is the most impact to be had?

08:30.040 --> 08:33.160
 I've been reading a lot about Hitler recently,

08:33.160 --> 08:35.520
 and one of the things that I'm more and more starting

08:35.520 --> 08:40.520
 to wonder, what the hell did he do alone in a room

08:40.720 --> 08:42.560
 with one on one with people?

08:42.560 --> 08:44.840
 Because it seems like that's where

08:44.840 --> 08:46.880
 he was exceptionally effective.

08:46.880 --> 08:49.080
 When I think about certain leaders,

08:50.480 --> 08:53.240
 I'm not sure Stalin was this way, I apologize.

08:53.240 --> 08:56.080
 Been very obsessed with this period of human history.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.480
 It just seems like certain leaders

08:59.480 --> 09:01.960
 are extremely effective one on one.

09:01.960 --> 09:05.000
 A lot of people think of Hitler in Lincoln

09:05.000 --> 09:08.640
 as a speech maker, as a great charismatic speech maker,

09:08.640 --> 09:11.600
 but it seems like to me that some of these guys

09:11.600 --> 09:14.840
 were really effective inside a room.

09:14.840 --> 09:15.880
 What do you think?

09:15.880 --> 09:17.360
 What's more important?

09:17.360 --> 09:22.360
 Your effectiveness to make a hell of a good speech,

09:23.640 --> 09:25.680
 sort of being in a room with many people,

09:25.680 --> 09:28.280
 or is it all boiled down to one on one?

09:28.280 --> 09:31.040
 Well, I think in a sense, it's both.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.560
 One needs to do both, and most politicians,

09:33.560 --> 09:35.480
 most leaders are better at one or the other.

09:35.480 --> 09:37.800
 It's the rare leader who can do both.

09:37.800 --> 09:41.600
 I will say that if you are going to be a figure

09:41.600 --> 09:45.480
 who's a president or the leader of a complex organization,

09:45.480 --> 09:47.400
 not a startup, but a complex organization

09:47.400 --> 09:49.360
 where you have many different constituencies

09:49.360 --> 09:51.440
 and many different interests,

09:51.440 --> 09:53.440
 you have to do the one on one really well,

09:53.440 --> 09:55.400
 because a lot of what's going to happen

09:55.400 --> 09:56.760
 is you're going to be meeting with people

09:56.760 --> 09:58.560
 who represent different groups, right?

09:58.560 --> 10:00.240
 The leader of the labor unions,

10:00.240 --> 10:03.160
 the leader of your investing board, et cetera,

10:03.160 --> 10:04.960
 and you have to be able to persuade them,

10:04.960 --> 10:07.640
 and it's the intangibles that often matter most.

10:07.640 --> 10:10.040
 Lincoln's skill, and it's the same that FDR had,

10:11.080 --> 10:13.040
 is the ability to tell a story.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.640
 I think Hitler was a little different,

10:14.640 --> 10:17.960
 but what I've read of Stalin is he was a storyteller too.

10:17.960 --> 10:18.960
 One on one storyteller?

10:18.960 --> 10:21.800
 Yeah, that's my understanding is that he,

10:21.800 --> 10:22.960
 and what Lincoln did,

10:22.960 --> 10:24.400
 I don't want to compare Lincoln to Stalin,

10:24.400 --> 10:29.400
 but what Lincoln did is he was not confrontational.

10:30.720 --> 10:32.280
 He was happy to have an argument

10:32.280 --> 10:33.520
 if an argument were to be had,

10:33.520 --> 10:35.680
 but actually what he would try to do

10:35.680 --> 10:38.800
 is move you through telling a story

10:38.800 --> 10:41.320
 that got you to think about your position in a different way,

10:41.320 --> 10:43.200
 to basically disarm you.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.800
 And Franklin Roosevelt did the same thing.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.240
 Ronald Reagan did the same thing.

10:46.240 --> 10:49.480
 Storytelling is a very important skill.

10:49.480 --> 10:53.120
 It's almost heartbreaking that we don't get to have,

10:53.120 --> 10:55.680
 or maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong on this,

10:55.680 --> 10:58.240
 but it feels like we don't have a lot of information

10:58.240 --> 11:00.760
 how all of these folks were in private,

11:00.760 --> 11:02.920
 one on one conversations.

11:02.920 --> 11:06.800
 Even if we get stories about it,

11:06.800 --> 11:09.920
 it's like, again, sorry to bring up Hitler,

11:09.920 --> 11:14.920
 but people have talked about his piercing gaze

11:15.240 --> 11:16.680
 when they're one on one.

11:16.680 --> 11:19.480
 There's a feeling like he's just looking through you.

11:19.480 --> 11:21.080
 I wonder, it makes me wonder,

11:21.080 --> 11:24.440
 was Lincoln somebody who was a little bit more passive,

11:24.440 --> 11:27.760
 like who's more, the ego doesn't shine.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.200
 It's not like an overwhelming thing,

11:29.200 --> 11:32.320
 or is it more like, again,

11:32.320 --> 11:34.000
 don't want to bring up controversial figures,

11:34.000 --> 11:37.600
 but Donald Trump, where it's more menacing, right?

11:37.600 --> 11:39.720
 There's a more like physically menacing thing,

11:39.720 --> 11:43.960
 where it's almost like a bullying kind of dynamic.

11:43.960 --> 11:47.280
 So I wonder, I wish we knew.

11:47.280 --> 11:50.520
 Because from a psychological perspective,

11:50.520 --> 11:52.000
 I wonder if there's a thread

11:52.000 --> 11:53.600
 that connects most great leaders.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.080
 That's a great question.

11:55.080 --> 11:58.120
 So I think the best writer on this is Max Weber, right?

11:58.120 --> 12:00.560
 And he talks about the power of charisma,

12:00.560 --> 12:02.840
 that the term charisma comes from Weber, right?

12:02.840 --> 12:05.960
 And Weber's use of it actually to talk about profits.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.880
 And I think he has a point, right?

12:07.880 --> 12:10.760
 Leaders who are effective in the way you describe

12:10.760 --> 12:12.800
 are leaders who feel prophetic,

12:12.800 --> 12:15.880
 or Weber says they have a kind of magic about them.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.880
 And I think that can come from different sources.

12:17.880 --> 12:20.600
 I think that can come from the way someone

12:20.600 --> 12:21.520
 carries themselves.

12:21.520 --> 12:24.000
 It can come from the way they use words.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.520
 So maybe there are different kinds of magic

12:26.520 --> 12:27.960
 that someone develops.

12:27.960 --> 12:29.240
 But I think there are two things

12:29.240 --> 12:31.400
 that seem to be absolutely necessary.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.760
 First is you have to be someone who sizes up the person

12:33.760 --> 12:35.080
 on the other side of the table.

12:35.080 --> 12:36.760
 You cannot be the person who just comes in

12:36.760 --> 12:38.760
 and reads your brief.

12:38.760 --> 12:41.240
 And then second, I think it's interactive.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.280
 And there is a quickness of thought.

12:44.280 --> 12:45.800
 So you brought up Donald Trump.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.840
 I don't think Donald Trump is a deep thinker at all,

12:47.840 --> 12:48.680
 but he's quick.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.720
 And I think that quickness is part of,

12:51.720 --> 12:53.800
 it's different from delivering a lecture

12:53.800 --> 12:55.080
 where it's the depth of your thought.

12:55.080 --> 12:57.760
 Can you for 45 minutes analyze something?

12:57.760 --> 12:59.320
 Many people can't do that,

12:59.320 --> 13:01.280
 but they still might be very effective

13:01.280 --> 13:03.480
 if they're able to quickly react,

13:03.480 --> 13:05.720
 size up the person on the other side of the table

13:05.720 --> 13:07.840
 and react in a way that moves that person

13:07.840 --> 13:09.920
 in the way they wanna move them.

13:09.920 --> 13:13.720
 Yeah, and there's also just coupled with the quickness

13:13.720 --> 13:17.360
 as a kind of instinct about human nature.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.000
 Sort of asking the question,

13:19.920 --> 13:22.280
 what does this person worry about?

13:22.280 --> 13:24.040
 What are the biggest problems?

13:24.040 --> 13:27.160
 Somebody, what is this, Stephen Schwartzman, I think,

13:27.160 --> 13:29.720
 said to me, he's this businessman.

13:29.720 --> 13:33.080
 I think he said like, what I've always tried to do

13:33.080 --> 13:36.960
 is try to figure out, like ask enough questions

13:36.960 --> 13:38.880
 to figure out what is the biggest problem

13:38.880 --> 13:40.880
 in this person's life.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.760
 Try to get a sense of what is the biggest problem

13:42.760 --> 13:44.120
 in their life, because that's actually

13:44.120 --> 13:45.760
 what they care about most.

13:45.760 --> 13:48.560
 And most people don't care enough to find out.

13:48.560 --> 13:52.200
 And so he kind of wants to sneak up on that

13:52.200 --> 13:57.200
 and find that, and then use that to then build closeness

13:58.200 --> 14:00.640
 in order to then probably, he doesn't put it in those words,

14:00.640 --> 14:03.000
 but to manipulate the person into whatever,

14:03.000 --> 14:04.440
 to do whatever the heck they want.

14:04.440 --> 14:09.080
 And I think part of it is that,

14:09.080 --> 14:11.600
 and part of the effect that Donald Trump has

14:11.600 --> 14:14.240
 is how quick he's able to figure that out.

14:14.240 --> 14:17.440
 You've written a book about how the role

14:17.440 --> 14:19.880
 and power of the presidency has changed.

14:19.880 --> 14:24.600
 So how has it changed since Lincoln's time,

14:25.500 --> 14:28.540
 the evolution of the presidency as a concept,

14:28.540 --> 14:30.560
 which seems like a fascinating lens

14:30.560 --> 14:33.280
 through which to look at American history.

14:33.280 --> 14:36.720
 As a president, we seem to only be talking

14:36.720 --> 14:40.020
 about the presidents, maybe a general here and there,

14:40.020 --> 14:43.600
 but it's mostly the story of America is often told

14:43.600 --> 14:45.160
 through presidents.

14:45.160 --> 14:46.680
 That's right, that's right.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.560
 And one of the points I've tried to make

14:48.560 --> 14:52.240
 in my writing about this and various other activities

14:52.240 --> 14:55.640
 is we use this word president as if it's something timeless,

14:55.640 --> 14:58.480
 but the office has changed incredibly.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.480
 Just from Lincoln's time to the present,

15:00.480 --> 15:05.240
 which is 150 years, he wouldn't recognize the office today.

15:05.240 --> 15:07.400
 And George Washington would not have recognized it

15:07.400 --> 15:10.780
 in Lincoln, just as I think a CEO today

15:10.780 --> 15:13.760
 would be unrecognizable to a Rockefeller

15:13.760 --> 15:16.640
 or a Carnegie of 150 years ago.

15:16.640 --> 15:18.880
 So what are some of the ways in which the office has changed?

15:18.880 --> 15:21.280
 I'll just point to three, there are a lot.

15:21.280 --> 15:25.560
 One, presidents now can communicate with the public directly.

15:25.560 --> 15:26.600
 I mean, we've reached the point now

15:26.600 --> 15:28.040
 where a president can have direct,

15:28.040 --> 15:30.020
 almost one on one communication.

15:30.020 --> 15:32.280
 President can use Twitter if he so chooses

15:32.280 --> 15:35.120
 to circumvent all media.

15:35.120 --> 15:36.160
 That was unthinkable.

15:36.160 --> 15:38.360
 Lincoln, in order to get his message across,

15:38.360 --> 15:40.560
 often wrote letters to newspapers.

15:40.560 --> 15:42.640
 And waited for the newspaper for Horace Greeley

15:42.640 --> 15:44.800
 in the New York Tribune to publish his letter.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.200
 That's how he communicated with the public.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.200
 There weren't even many speaking opportunities.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.820
 So that's a big change, right?

15:49.820 --> 15:52.200
 We feel the president in our life much more.

15:52.200 --> 15:55.240
 That's why we talk about him much more.

15:55.240 --> 15:56.280
 That also creates more of a burden.

15:56.280 --> 15:57.240
 This is the second point.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.480
 Presidents are under a microscope.

15:59.480 --> 16:00.760
 Presidents are under a microscope.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.920
 You have to be very careful what you do and what you say.

16:02.920 --> 16:06.600
 And you're judged by a lot of the elements of your behavior

16:06.600 --> 16:07.860
 that are not policy relevant.

16:07.860 --> 16:09.320
 In fact, the things we judge most

16:09.320 --> 16:12.000
 and make most of our decisions on about individuals

16:12.000 --> 16:13.080
 are often that.

16:13.080 --> 16:17.640
 And then third, the power the president has.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.180
 It's inhuman, actually.

16:19.180 --> 16:20.480
 And this is one of my critiques

16:20.480 --> 16:21.560
 of how the office has changed.

16:21.560 --> 16:24.240
 This one person has power on a scale

16:24.240 --> 16:27.280
 that's I think dangerous in a democracy.

16:27.280 --> 16:31.920
 And certainly something the founders 220 years ago

16:31.920 --> 16:34.420
 would have had trouble conceiving.

16:34.420 --> 16:36.560
 Presidents now have the ability to deliver force

16:36.560 --> 16:39.540
 across the world to literally assassinate people

16:39.540 --> 16:41.600
 with a remarkable accuracy.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.640
 And that's an enormous power that presidents have.

16:44.640 --> 16:48.240
 So your sense, this is not to get conspiratorial,

16:48.240 --> 16:53.240
 but do you think a president currently has the power

16:53.640 --> 16:58.640
 to initiate the assassination of somebody,

16:59.140 --> 17:03.520
 of a political enemy or a terrorist leader

17:03.520 --> 17:07.480
 or that kind of thing to frame that person in a way

17:07.480 --> 17:10.640
 where assassination is something that he alone

17:10.640 --> 17:12.360
 or she alone could decide to do?

17:12.360 --> 17:13.520
 I think it happens all the time

17:13.520 --> 17:14.680
 and it's not to be conspiratorial.

17:14.680 --> 17:19.360
 This is how we fought terrorism by targeting individuals.

17:19.360 --> 17:21.680
 Now you might say these were not elected leaders of state,

17:21.680 --> 17:23.400
 but these were individuals with a large following.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.640
 I mean, the killing of Osama Bin Laden

17:25.640 --> 17:28.960
 was an assassination operation.

17:28.960 --> 17:32.000
 And we've taken out very successfully

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
 many leaders of terrorist organizations

17:34.000 --> 17:35.640
 and we do it every day.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.640
 You're saying that back in Lincoln's time

17:37.640 --> 17:39.120
 or George Washington's time,

17:39.120 --> 17:40.760
 there was more of a balance of power?

17:40.760 --> 17:42.520
 Like a president could not initiate

17:42.520 --> 17:43.840
 this kind of assassination?

17:43.840 --> 17:46.120
 Correct, I think presidents did not have

17:46.120 --> 17:49.280
 the same kind of military or economic power.

17:49.280 --> 17:52.080
 We could talk about how a president can influence a market

17:52.080 --> 17:56.720
 by saying something about where money is gonna go

17:56.720 --> 18:00.000
 or singling out a company or critiquing a company

18:00.000 --> 18:01.220
 in one way or another.

18:01.220 --> 18:02.360
 They didn't have that kind of power.

18:02.360 --> 18:06.020
 Now, much of the power that a Lincoln or a Washington had

18:06.020 --> 18:08.200
 was the power to mobilize people

18:08.200 --> 18:09.720
 to then make their own decisions.

18:09.720 --> 18:11.540
 At the start of the Civil War,

18:11.540 --> 18:12.720
 Lincoln doesn't even have the power

18:12.720 --> 18:13.920
 to bring people into the army.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.620
 He has to go to the governors

18:15.620 --> 18:18.280
 and ask the governors to provide soldiers.

18:18.280 --> 18:19.640
 So the governor of Wisconsin,

18:19.640 --> 18:20.800
 the governor of Massachusetts.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.280
 Could you imagine that today?

18:22.280 --> 18:27.280
 So, but yeah, so they use speeches and words

18:27.280 --> 18:32.280
 to mobilize versus direct action in closed door environments,

18:32.500 --> 18:34.640
 initiating wars, for example.

18:34.640 --> 18:35.480
 Correct.

18:37.160 --> 18:39.140
 It's difficult to think about,

18:39.140 --> 18:41.280
 if we look at Barack Obama, for example,

18:43.200 --> 18:44.640
 if you're listening to this

18:45.740 --> 18:47.920
 and you're on the left or the right,

18:47.920 --> 18:49.220
 please do not make this political.

18:49.220 --> 18:51.520
 In fact, if you're a political person

18:51.520 --> 18:54.240
 and you're getting angry at the mention of the word Obama

18:54.240 --> 18:56.560
 or Donald Trump, please turn off this podcast

18:56.560 --> 18:57.960
 that I've just described.

18:57.960 --> 18:59.560
 We're not gonna get very far.

18:59.560 --> 19:02.180
 I hope we maintain a political discussion

19:02.180 --> 19:05.040
 about even the modern presidents

19:05.040 --> 19:07.460
 that view through the lens of history.

19:07.460 --> 19:09.040
 I think there's a lot to be learned

19:09.040 --> 19:12.200
 about the office and about human nature.

19:13.080 --> 19:15.060
 Some people criticize Barack Obama

19:15.060 --> 19:19.520
 for sort of expanding the military industrial complex,

19:19.520 --> 19:22.200
 engaging in more and more wars,

19:22.200 --> 19:25.620
 as opposed to sort of the initial rhetoric

19:25.620 --> 19:27.680
 was such that we would pull back

19:28.560 --> 19:30.720
 from sort of be more skeptical

19:30.720 --> 19:33.120
 in our decisions to wage wars.

19:33.120 --> 19:36.880
 So from the lens of the power of the presidency,

19:36.880 --> 19:38.540
 as the modern presidency,

19:39.600 --> 19:41.920
 the fact that we continued the war in Afghanistan

19:41.920 --> 19:45.640
 and different engagements in military conflicts,

19:46.740 --> 19:51.740
 do you think Barack Obama could have stopped that?

19:52.320 --> 19:55.480
 Do you put the responsibility on that expansion

19:55.480 --> 19:58.160
 on him because of the implied power

19:58.160 --> 19:59.720
 that the presidency has?

19:59.720 --> 20:01.920
 Or is this power just sits there

20:01.920 --> 20:04.560
 and if a president chooses to take it, they do,

20:04.560 --> 20:06.840
 and if they don't, they don't?

20:06.840 --> 20:10.080
 Almost like you don't want to take on the responsibility

20:10.080 --> 20:12.960
 because of the burden of that responsibility.

20:12.960 --> 20:16.360
 So a lot of my research is about this exact question,

20:16.360 --> 20:17.680
 not just with Obama.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.780
 And my conclusion, and I think the research

20:19.780 --> 20:21.920
 is pretty clear on this, is that structure

20:21.920 --> 20:24.940
 has a lot more effect on us than we like to admit,

20:24.940 --> 20:26.760
 which is to say that the circumstances,

20:26.760 --> 20:29.540
 the institutions around us drive our behavior

20:29.540 --> 20:30.600
 more than we like to think.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.640
 So Barack Obama, I'm quite certain,

20:32.640 --> 20:34.840
 came into the office of the presidency committed

20:34.840 --> 20:37.880
 to actually reducing the use of military force overseas

20:37.880 --> 20:40.800
 and reducing presidential war making power.

20:40.800 --> 20:43.180
 As a trained lawyer, he had a moral position

20:43.180 --> 20:45.320
 on this actually, and he tried.

20:45.320 --> 20:47.700
 And he did withdraw American forces from Iraq

20:47.700 --> 20:50.640
 and was of course criticized by many people for doing that.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.680
 But at the same time, he had some real problems

20:52.680 --> 20:55.600
 in the world to deal with, terrorism being one of them.

20:55.600 --> 20:59.040
 And the tools he has are very much biased

20:59.040 --> 21:01.080
 towards the use of military force.

21:01.080 --> 21:04.160
 It's much harder as president to go and get Vladimir Putin

21:04.160 --> 21:06.400
 and Xi Jinping to agree with you.

21:06.400 --> 21:09.800
 It's much easier to send these wonderful toys we have

21:09.800 --> 21:12.800
 and these incredible soldiers we have over there.

21:12.800 --> 21:15.860
 And when you have Congress, which is always against you,

21:15.860 --> 21:17.640
 it's also easier to use the military

21:17.640 --> 21:18.920
 because you send them there.

21:18.920 --> 21:21.040
 And even if members of Congress from your own party

21:21.040 --> 21:23.000
 or the other are angry at you,

21:23.000 --> 21:24.240
 they'll still fund the soldiers.

21:24.240 --> 21:25.920
 No member of Congress wants to vote

21:25.920 --> 21:27.980
 to starve our soldiers overseas.

21:27.980 --> 21:29.000
 So they'll stop your budget,

21:29.000 --> 21:31.240
 they'll even threaten not to pay the debt,

21:31.240 --> 21:33.040
 but they'll still fund your soldiers.

21:33.040 --> 21:36.960
 And so you are pushed by the circumstances you're in

21:36.960 --> 21:39.880
 to do this, and it's very hard to resist.

21:39.880 --> 21:42.360
 So that's, I think the criticism of Obama,

21:42.360 --> 21:45.080
 the fair one would be that he didn't resist the pressures

21:45.080 --> 21:47.800
 that were there, but he did not make those pressures.

21:47.800 --> 21:52.000
 So is there something about putting the responsibility

21:52.000 --> 21:57.000
 on the president to form the structure around him locally

21:57.040 --> 22:01.580
 such that he can make the policy that matches the rhetoric?

22:01.580 --> 22:04.800
 So what I'm talking to is hiring.

22:05.680 --> 22:08.840
 So basically just everybody you work with,

22:08.840 --> 22:12.120
 you have power as a president to fire and hire

22:12.120 --> 22:16.400
 or to basically schedule meetings in such a way

22:16.400 --> 22:19.960
 that can control your decision making.

22:19.960 --> 22:24.380
 So I imagine it's very difficult to get out of Afghanistan

22:24.380 --> 22:28.520
 or Iraq when most of your scheduled meetings

22:28.520 --> 22:31.240
 are with generals or something like that.

22:31.240 --> 22:33.720
 But if you reorganize the schedule

22:33.720 --> 22:37.740
 and you reorganize who you have like late night talks with,

22:37.740 --> 22:41.860
 you potentially have a huge ripple effect on the policy.

22:41.860 --> 22:42.700
 I think that's right.

22:42.700 --> 22:44.600
 I think who has access to the president

22:44.600 --> 22:45.880
 is absolutely crucial.

22:45.880 --> 22:48.080
 And presidents have to be more strategic about that.

22:48.080 --> 22:50.480
 They tend to be reacting to crises

22:50.480 --> 22:52.200
 because every day has a crisis.

22:52.200 --> 22:53.240
 And if you're reacting to a crisis,

22:53.240 --> 22:54.360
 you're not controlling access

22:54.360 --> 22:56.300
 because the crisis is driving you.

22:56.300 --> 22:57.640
 So that's one element of it.

22:57.640 --> 23:00.200
 But I also think, and this is the moment we're in right now,

23:00.200 --> 23:04.140
 presidents have to invest in reforming the system,

23:04.140 --> 23:05.820
 the system of decision making.

23:05.820 --> 23:07.760
 Should we have a national security council

23:07.760 --> 23:09.320
 that looks the way it does?

23:09.320 --> 23:11.620
 Should our military be structured the way it is?

23:11.620 --> 23:14.680
 The founding fathers wanted a military that was divided.

23:14.680 --> 23:17.000
 They did not want a unified department of defense.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.160
 That was only created after World War II.

23:19.160 --> 23:20.800
 Should we have as large a military as we have?

23:20.800 --> 23:23.040
 Should we be in as many places?

23:23.040 --> 23:25.320
 There are some fundamental structural reforms

23:25.320 --> 23:26.720
 we have to undertake.

23:26.720 --> 23:28.180
 And part of that is who you appoint,

23:28.180 --> 23:30.620
 but part of that is also how you change the institutions.

23:30.620 --> 23:32.320
 The genius of the American system

23:32.320 --> 23:34.220
 is that it's a dynamic system.

23:34.220 --> 23:35.480
 It can be adjusted.

23:35.480 --> 23:37.200
 It has been adjusted over time.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.600
 That's the heroic story.

23:39.600 --> 23:43.600
 The frustrating story is it often takes us a long time

23:43.600 --> 23:45.440
 to make those adjustments until we go

23:45.440 --> 23:48.800
 into such bad circumstances that we have no choice.

23:48.800 --> 23:53.480
 So in the battle of power of the office of the president

23:53.480 --> 23:56.540
 versus the United States military,

23:56.540 --> 23:58.720
 the department of defense,

23:58.720 --> 24:00.000
 do you have a sense that the president

24:00.000 --> 24:01.960
 has more power ultimately?

24:01.960 --> 24:06.060
 So to decrease the size of the department of defense,

24:06.060 --> 24:08.620
 to withdraw from any wars,

24:08.620 --> 24:11.200
 or increase the amount of wars,

24:11.200 --> 24:13.880
 is the president, you're kind of implying

24:13.880 --> 24:16.700
 the president has a lot of power here in this scale.

24:16.700 --> 24:18.280
 Yes, the president has a lot of power

24:18.280 --> 24:20.440
 and we are fortunate and it was just proven

24:20.440 --> 24:22.560
 in the last few years that our military,

24:22.560 --> 24:26.140
 uniquely among many countries with large militaries,

24:26.140 --> 24:27.920
 is very deferential to the president

24:27.920 --> 24:29.540
 and very restricted in its ability

24:29.540 --> 24:31.360
 to challenge the president.

24:31.360 --> 24:33.800
 So that's a strength of our system.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.920
 But the way you reform the military

24:35.920 --> 24:37.640
 is not with individual decisions.

24:37.640 --> 24:40.380
 It's by having a strategic plan

24:40.380 --> 24:43.080
 that reexamines what role it plays.

24:43.080 --> 24:45.640
 So it's not just about whether we're in Afghanistan or not.

24:45.640 --> 24:47.520
 The question we have to ask is,

24:47.520 --> 24:48.880
 when we look at our toolbox

24:48.880 --> 24:51.560
 of what we can do in our foreign policy,

24:51.560 --> 24:54.920
 are there other tools we should build up

24:54.920 --> 24:58.020
 and therefore some tools in the military we should reduce?

24:58.020 --> 25:00.320
 That's the broader strategic question.

25:00.320 --> 25:03.180
 Let me ask you the most absurd question of all

25:03.180 --> 25:04.600
 that you did not sign up for,

25:04.600 --> 25:06.720
 but I've been hanging out

25:06.720 --> 25:08.720
 with a guy named Joe Rogan recently,

25:08.720 --> 25:13.560
 so it's very important for me and him to figure this out.

25:13.560 --> 25:15.560
 If a president, because you said,

25:15.560 --> 25:17.640
 you implied the president's very powerful,

25:17.640 --> 25:21.320
 if a president shows up and the US government is in fact

25:21.320 --> 25:24.040
 in possession of aliens, alien spacecraft,

25:25.080 --> 25:28.720
 do you think the president will be told?

25:28.720 --> 25:32.840
 A more responsible adult historian question version of that

25:32.840 --> 25:37.680
 is, is there some things that the machine of government

25:37.680 --> 25:40.560
 keeps secret from the president?

25:40.560 --> 25:42.720
 Or is the president ultimately at the very center?

25:42.720 --> 25:46.520
 So if you map out the set of information and power,

25:46.520 --> 25:49.200
 you have CIA, you have all these organizations

25:49.200 --> 25:53.800
 that do the machinery of government,

25:53.800 --> 25:55.800
 not just the passing of bills,

25:55.800 --> 26:00.800
 but gaining information, homeland security,

26:01.680 --> 26:06.680
 actually engaging in wars, all those kinds of things.

26:06.680 --> 26:09.160
 How central is the president?

26:09.160 --> 26:11.440
 Would the president know some of the shady things

26:11.440 --> 26:12.420
 that are going on?

26:14.080 --> 26:18.740
 Aliens or some kind of cybersecurity stuff

26:18.740 --> 26:21.400
 against Russia and China, all those kinds of things,

26:21.400 --> 26:23.440
 is the president really made aware?

26:23.440 --> 26:26.440
 And if so, how nervous does that make you?

26:26.440 --> 26:30.880
 So presidents like leaders of any complex organizations

26:30.880 --> 26:32.880
 don't know everything that goes on.

26:32.880 --> 26:34.140
 They have to ask the right questions.

26:34.140 --> 26:35.600
 This is Machiavelli.

26:35.600 --> 26:38.680
 Most important thing a leader has to do

26:38.680 --> 26:40.100
 is ask the right questions.

26:40.100 --> 26:41.840
 You don't have to know the answers.

26:41.840 --> 26:43.680
 That's why you hire smart people,

26:43.680 --> 26:45.400
 but you have to ask the right questions.

26:45.400 --> 26:48.440
 So if the president asks the US government,

26:48.440 --> 26:50.320
 those who are responsible for the aliens

26:50.320 --> 26:53.640
 or responsible for the cyber warfare against Russia,

26:53.640 --> 26:56.160
 they will answer honestly, they will have to,

26:56.160 --> 27:00.000
 but they will not volunteer that information in all cases.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.560
 So the best way a president can operate

27:01.560 --> 27:04.680
 is to have people around him or her

27:04.680 --> 27:06.640
 who are not the traditional policymakers,

27:06.640 --> 27:09.520
 this is where I think academic experts are important,

27:09.520 --> 27:12.800
 suggesting questions to ask

27:12.800 --> 27:14.760
 to therefore try to get the information.

27:14.760 --> 27:18.480
 It makes me nervous because I think human nature

27:18.480 --> 27:22.060
 is such that the academics, the experts,

27:23.080 --> 27:27.120
 everybody is almost afraid to ask the questions

27:27.120 --> 27:32.120
 for which the answers might be burdensome.

27:32.800 --> 27:33.840
 Yes.

27:33.840 --> 27:34.880
 And so that's right.

27:34.880 --> 27:37.720
 And you can get into a lot of trouble not asking,

27:37.720 --> 27:40.160
 it's the old elephant in the room.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.840
 Correct, correct.

27:42.960 --> 27:44.160
 This is exactly right.

27:44.160 --> 27:46.720
 And too often mediocre leaders

27:46.720 --> 27:49.520
 and those who try to protect them try to shield themselves.

27:49.520 --> 27:51.480
 They don't want to know certain things.

27:51.480 --> 27:53.200
 So this is part of what happened

27:53.200 --> 27:55.640
 with the use of torture by the United States,

27:55.640 --> 27:59.400
 which is a war crime during the war on terror.

27:59.400 --> 28:02.640
 President Bush at times intentionally did not ask

28:02.640 --> 28:04.880
 and people around him prevented him from asking

28:04.880 --> 28:06.520
 or discouraged him from asking questions

28:06.520 --> 28:09.640
 he should have asked to know about what was going on.

28:09.640 --> 28:12.360
 And that's how we ended up where we did.

28:12.360 --> 28:15.360
 You could say the same thing about Reagan and Iran Contra.

28:15.360 --> 28:18.600
 I wonder what it takes to be the kind of leader

28:18.600 --> 28:21.160
 that steps in and asks some difficult questions.

28:21.160 --> 28:24.640
 So aliens is one, UFO spacecraft, right?

28:25.560 --> 28:28.320
 Another one, yeah, torture is another one.

28:28.320 --> 28:30.560
 The CIA, how much information

28:30.560 --> 28:32.720
 is being collected about Americans?

28:32.720 --> 28:35.640
 I can see as a president being very uncomfortable

28:35.640 --> 28:37.120
 asking that question.

28:37.120 --> 28:39.480
 Because if the answer is a lot of information

28:39.480 --> 28:41.640
 is being collected by Americans,

28:41.640 --> 28:43.560
 then you have to be the guy

28:43.560 --> 28:46.480
 who lives with that information.

28:46.480 --> 28:50.040
 For the rest of your life, you have to walk around.

28:50.040 --> 28:53.320
 You're probably not going to reform that system.

28:53.320 --> 28:54.160
 It's very difficult.

28:54.160 --> 28:55.640
 You probably have to be very picky

28:55.640 --> 28:57.080
 about which things you reform.

28:57.080 --> 28:58.680
 You don't have much time.

28:58.680 --> 29:01.760
 It takes a lot of sort of effort to restructure things.

29:01.760 --> 29:04.880
 But you nevertheless would have to be basically lying

29:06.000 --> 29:11.000
 to yourself, to others around you

29:11.080 --> 29:13.240
 about the unethical things.

29:13.240 --> 29:17.200
 Depends of course what your ethical system is.

29:17.200 --> 29:20.400
 I wonder what it takes to ask those hard questions.

29:20.400 --> 29:25.400
 I wonder if how few of us can be great leaders like that.

29:25.400 --> 29:29.400
 And I wonder if our political system, the electoral system

29:29.400 --> 29:32.160
 is such that makes it likely

29:32.160 --> 29:34.800
 that such leaders will come to power.

29:34.800 --> 29:36.760
 It's hard and you can't ask all the right questions

29:36.760 --> 29:39.400
 and there is a legal hazard if you know things

29:39.400 --> 29:40.760
 at certain times.

29:40.760 --> 29:42.920
 But I think you can, back to your point on hiring,

29:42.920 --> 29:45.680
 you can hire people who will do that in their domains.

29:45.680 --> 29:47.440
 And then you have to trust that when they think

29:47.440 --> 29:49.440
 it's something that's a question you need to ask,

29:49.440 --> 29:51.280
 they'll pass that on to you.

29:51.280 --> 29:54.160
 This is why it's not a good idea to have loyalists

29:54.160 --> 29:57.000
 because loyalists will shield you from things.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.560
 It's a good idea to have people of integrity

29:59.560 --> 30:01.880
 who you can rely on and who you think will ask

30:01.880 --> 30:03.960
 those right questions and then pass that down

30:03.960 --> 30:05.280
 through their organization.

30:06.960 --> 30:10.240
 What's inspiring to you, what's insightful to you

30:10.240 --> 30:12.800
 about several of the presidencies

30:12.800 --> 30:14.920
 throughout the recent decades?

30:14.920 --> 30:16.480
 Is there somebody that stands out to you

30:16.480 --> 30:19.760
 that's interesting and sort of in your study

30:19.760 --> 30:21.420
 of how the office has changed?

30:21.420 --> 30:25.300
 Well, Bill Clinton is one of the most fascinating figures.

30:25.300 --> 30:26.820
 Why can't I, I apologize.

30:26.820 --> 30:28.580
 Bill Clinton just puts a smile on my face

30:28.580 --> 30:30.420
 every time somebody mentions him at this point.

30:30.420 --> 30:31.700
 I don't know why.

30:31.700 --> 30:33.500
 I guess it's charisma, I suppose.

30:33.500 --> 30:36.340
 Well, and he's a unique individual,

30:36.340 --> 30:41.340
 but he fascinates me because he's a figure

30:41.660 --> 30:45.660
 of such enormous talent and enormous appetite

30:45.660 --> 30:50.660
 and such little self control and such extremes.

30:50.660 --> 30:53.140
 And I think it's not just that he tells us

30:53.140 --> 30:53.980
 something about the presidency,

30:53.980 --> 30:56.180
 he tells us something about our society.

30:56.180 --> 30:58.980
 American society, this is not new to our time,

30:58.980 --> 31:02.700
 is filled with enormous reservoirs of talent and creativity.

31:02.700 --> 31:05.500
 And those have a bright and a dark side.

31:05.500 --> 31:06.900
 And you see both with Bill Clinton.

31:06.900 --> 31:09.760
 In some ways, he's the mirror of the best and worst

31:09.760 --> 31:10.940
 of our society.

31:10.940 --> 31:13.040
 And maybe that's really what presidents are in the end.

31:13.040 --> 31:14.660
 They're mirrors of our world

31:14.660 --> 31:16.180
 that we get the government we deserve,

31:16.180 --> 31:18.060
 we get the leaders we deserve.

31:18.060 --> 31:20.220
 I wish we embraced that a little bit more.

31:20.220 --> 31:22.460
 A lot of people criticize Donald Trump

31:22.460 --> 31:24.740
 for certain human qualities that he has.

31:24.740 --> 31:27.040
 A lot of people criticize Bill Clinton

31:27.040 --> 31:28.580
 for certain human qualities.

31:28.580 --> 31:30.940
 I wish we kind of embraced the chaos of that.

31:32.140 --> 31:35.460
 Because he does, you're right, in some sense represent,

31:35.460 --> 31:39.740
 I mean, he doesn't represent the greatest ideal of America,

31:39.740 --> 31:43.720
 but the flawed aspect of human nature is what he represents.

31:43.720 --> 31:45.300
 And that's the beautiful thing about America,

31:45.300 --> 31:49.740
 the diversity of this land with the mix of it,

31:49.740 --> 31:53.660
 the corruption within capitalism,

31:53.660 --> 31:56.800
 the beauty of capitalism, the innovation,

31:56.800 --> 31:57.760
 all those kinds of things,

31:57.760 --> 32:01.620
 the people that start from nothing and create everything,

32:01.620 --> 32:04.380
 the Elon Musk's of the world and the Bill Gates and so on.

32:04.380 --> 32:08.240
 But also the people, Bernie Mados and all,

32:08.240 --> 32:11.620
 as the Me Too movement has showed the multitude of creeps

32:11.620 --> 32:15.200
 that apparently permeate the entirety of our system.

32:15.200 --> 32:20.200
 So I don't know, there is something, there is some sense

32:21.020 --> 32:24.600
 in which we put our president on a pedestal,

32:24.600 --> 32:29.600
 which actually creates a fake human being.

32:30.180 --> 32:33.220
 Like the standard we hold them to

32:33.220 --> 32:36.620
 is forcing the fake politicians to come to power

32:36.620 --> 32:39.140
 versus the authentic one, which is in some sense,

32:39.140 --> 32:42.740
 the promise of Donald Trump is like,

32:42.740 --> 32:46.420
 it's a definitive statement of authenticity.

32:46.420 --> 32:50.540
 It's like, this is the opposite of the fake politician.

32:50.540 --> 32:52.580
 It's whatever else you wanna say about him

32:52.580 --> 32:55.880
 is there's the chaos that's unlike anything else

32:55.880 --> 32:57.520
 that came before.

32:57.520 --> 33:00.560
 One thing, and this is a particular maybe preference

33:00.560 --> 33:03.300
 and quirk of mine, but I really admire,

33:03.300 --> 33:05.400
 maybe I'm romanticizing the past again,

33:05.400 --> 33:07.500
 but I romanticize the presidents

33:07.500 --> 33:09.300
 that were students of history.

33:09.300 --> 33:14.300
 They were almost like king philosophers,

33:17.620 --> 33:22.620
 that made speeches that reverberated through decades after.

33:26.860 --> 33:28.780
 Using the words of those presidents,

33:28.780 --> 33:30.580
 whether written by them or not,

33:30.580 --> 33:32.520
 we tell the story of America.

33:33.460 --> 33:37.740
 And I don't know, even Obama has been an exceptionally good,

33:37.740 --> 33:40.320
 as far as I know, I apologize if I'm incorrect on this,

33:40.320 --> 33:42.260
 but from everything I've seen,

33:42.260 --> 33:44.560
 he was a very deep scholar of history.

33:45.740 --> 33:48.100
 And I really admire that.

33:48.100 --> 33:53.100
 Is that through the history of the office of the presidency,

33:53.520 --> 33:55.940
 is that just your own preference

33:55.940 --> 33:58.080
 or is that supposed to come with the job?

33:58.080 --> 34:00.020
 Are you supposed to be a student of history?

34:00.020 --> 34:02.100
 I think, I mean, I'm obviously biased as a historian,

34:02.100 --> 34:03.740
 but I do think it comes with the job.

34:03.740 --> 34:08.620
 Every president I've studied had a serious interest

34:08.620 --> 34:09.460
 in history.

34:09.460 --> 34:13.180
 Now, how they pursued that interest would vary.

34:13.180 --> 34:16.560
 Obama was more bookish, more academic.

34:16.560 --> 34:18.540
 So was George W. Bush in strange ways.

34:18.540 --> 34:20.180
 George H. W. Bush was less so,

34:20.180 --> 34:22.180
 but George H. W. Bush loved to talk to people.

34:22.180 --> 34:24.380
 So he would talk to historians, right?

34:24.380 --> 34:27.220
 Ronald Reagan loved movies

34:27.220 --> 34:30.020
 and movies were an insight into history for him.

34:30.020 --> 34:32.900
 He likes to watch movies about another time.

34:32.900 --> 34:34.740
 It wasn't always the best of history,

34:34.740 --> 34:35.920
 but he was interested

34:35.920 --> 34:38.700
 in what is a fundamental historical question.

34:38.700 --> 34:40.780
 How has our society developed?

34:40.780 --> 34:43.380
 How has it grown and changed over time?

34:43.380 --> 34:46.980
 And how has that change affected who we are today?

34:46.980 --> 34:48.820
 That's the historical question.

34:48.820 --> 34:50.100
 It's really interesting to me.

34:50.100 --> 34:53.620
 I do a lot of work with business leaders and others too.

34:53.620 --> 34:55.940
 You reach a certain point in any career

34:55.940 --> 34:57.660
 and you become a historian

34:57.660 --> 35:00.380
 because you realize that the formulas

35:00.380 --> 35:02.140
 and the technical knowledge that you've gained

35:02.140 --> 35:04.020
 got you to where you are.

35:04.020 --> 35:07.280
 But now your decisions are about human nature.

35:07.280 --> 35:09.420
 Your decisions are about social change

35:09.420 --> 35:12.020
 and they can't be answered technically.

35:12.020 --> 35:15.100
 They can only be answered by studying human beings.

35:15.100 --> 35:15.920
 And what is history?

35:15.920 --> 35:18.220
 It's studying the laboratory of human behavior.

35:19.700 --> 35:21.640
 To sort of play devil's advocate,

35:21.640 --> 35:26.640
 I kind of, especially in the engineering scientific domains,

35:27.820 --> 35:30.340
 I often see history holding us back.

35:30.340 --> 35:34.100
 Sort of the way things were done in the past

35:34.100 --> 35:36.260
 are not necessarily going to hold the key

35:36.260 --> 35:41.260
 to what will progress us into the future.

35:43.060 --> 35:45.820
 Of course, with history in studying human nature,

35:45.820 --> 35:47.980
 it does seem like humans are just the same.

35:49.060 --> 35:51.740
 She has like the same problems over and over.

35:51.740 --> 35:55.580
 So in that sense, it feels like history has all the lessons,

35:55.580 --> 35:56.980
 whether we're talking about wars,

35:56.980 --> 35:58.880
 whether we're talking about corruption,

35:58.880 --> 36:01.100
 whether we're talking about economics.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.300
 I think there's a difference between

36:04.300 --> 36:06.620
 history and antiquarianism.

36:06.620 --> 36:10.020
 So antiquarianism, which some people call history,

36:10.020 --> 36:12.000
 is the desire to go back to the past

36:12.000 --> 36:13.040
 or stay stuck in the past.

36:13.040 --> 36:16.000
 So antiquarianism is the desire to have the desk

36:16.000 --> 36:17.300
 that Abraham Lincoln sat at.

36:17.300 --> 36:19.180
 Wouldn't it be cool to sit at his desk?

36:19.180 --> 36:20.280
 I'd love to have that desk.

36:20.280 --> 36:22.860
 If I had a few extra million dollars, I'd acquire it.

36:22.860 --> 36:25.640
 So in a way, that's antiquarianism.

36:25.640 --> 36:28.740
 That's trying to capture and hold on to the past.

36:28.740 --> 36:31.980
 The past is a talisman for antiquarians.

36:32.980 --> 36:35.980
 What history is, is the study of change over time.

36:35.980 --> 36:38.260
 That's the real definition of historical study

36:38.260 --> 36:39.860
 and historical thinking.

36:39.860 --> 36:42.200
 And so what we're studying is change.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.400
 And so a historian should never say,

36:45.840 --> 36:47.700
 we have to do things the way we've done them in the past.

36:47.700 --> 36:49.860
 The historian should say, we can't do them

36:49.860 --> 36:51.020
 the way we did them in the past.

36:51.020 --> 36:53.100
 We can't step in the same river twice.

36:53.100 --> 36:56.500
 Every podcast of yours is different from the last one.

36:56.500 --> 36:59.340
 You plan it out and then it goes in its own direction.

37:00.420 --> 37:02.980
 And what are we studying then in history?

37:02.980 --> 37:05.500
 We're studying the patterns of change

37:05.500 --> 37:08.020
 and we're recognizing we're part of a pattern.

37:08.020 --> 37:10.000
 So what I would say to the historian

37:10.000 --> 37:11.280
 who's trying to hold the engineer back,

37:11.280 --> 37:14.820
 I'd say, no, don't tell that engineer not to do this.

37:14.820 --> 37:16.820
 Tell them to understand how this fits

37:16.820 --> 37:20.040
 into the relationship with other engineering products

37:20.040 --> 37:22.100
 and other activities from the past

37:22.100 --> 37:23.620
 that still affect us today.

37:23.620 --> 37:25.620
 For example, any product you produce

37:25.620 --> 37:28.500
 is gonna be used by human beings who have prejudices.

37:28.500 --> 37:30.240
 It's gonna go into an unequal society.

37:30.240 --> 37:32.180
 Don't assume it's gonna go into an equal society.

37:32.180 --> 37:34.660
 Don't assume that when you create a social media site

37:34.660 --> 37:36.220
 that people are going to use it fairly

37:36.220 --> 37:38.900
 and put only truthful things on it.

37:38.900 --> 37:39.740
 We shouldn't be surprised.

37:39.740 --> 37:42.060
 That's where human nature comes in.

37:42.060 --> 37:43.520
 But it's not trying to hold onto the past.

37:43.520 --> 37:45.020
 It's trying to use the knowledge from the past

37:45.020 --> 37:46.940
 to better inform the changes today.

37:48.020 --> 37:50.620
 I have to ask you about George Washington.

37:50.620 --> 37:52.680
 Maybe you have some insights.

37:52.680 --> 37:56.660
 It seems like he's such a fascinating figure

37:56.660 --> 37:58.940
 in the context of the study of power.

37:59.860 --> 38:03.940
 Because I kind of intuitively have come to internalize

38:03.940 --> 38:06.120
 the belief that power corrupts

38:06.120 --> 38:07.780
 and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

38:07.780 --> 38:08.620
 Yes.

38:11.700 --> 38:15.500
 And sort of like basically in thinking

38:15.500 --> 38:18.540
 that we cannot trust any one individual.

38:18.540 --> 38:20.800
 I can't trust myself with power.

38:20.800 --> 38:22.860
 Nobody can trust anybody with power.

38:22.860 --> 38:24.880
 We have to create institutions and structures

38:24.880 --> 38:27.300
 that prevent us from ever being able

38:27.300 --> 38:29.220
 to amass absolute power.

38:29.220 --> 38:31.540
 And yet, here's a guy, George Washington,

38:31.540 --> 38:34.280
 who seems to, you can correct me if I'm wrong,

38:34.280 --> 38:37.180
 but he seems to give away, relinquish power.

38:37.180 --> 38:39.100
 It feels like George Washington did it

38:40.580 --> 38:43.260
 almost like the purest of ways,

38:43.260 --> 38:46.620
 which is believes in this country,

38:46.620 --> 38:48.660
 but he just believes he's not the person

38:48.660 --> 38:52.980
 to carry it forward.

38:54.020 --> 38:55.460
 What do you make of that?

38:55.460 --> 38:58.640
 What kind of human does it take to give away that power?

38:58.640 --> 39:01.660
 Is there some hopeful message we can carry through

39:01.660 --> 39:05.140
 to the future to elect leaders like that

39:05.140 --> 39:09.580
 or to find friends to hang out with who are like that?

39:09.580 --> 39:10.420
 Like what is that?

39:10.420 --> 39:11.340
 How do you explain that?

39:11.340 --> 39:14.020
 So it's actually the most important thing

39:14.020 --> 39:14.980
 about George Washington.

39:14.980 --> 39:16.660
 It's the right thing to bring up.

39:16.660 --> 39:21.420
 What the historian Gary Wills wrote years ago,

39:21.420 --> 39:22.260
 I'm gonna quote him,

39:22.260 --> 39:23.940
 was that Washington recognized

39:23.940 --> 39:26.660
 that sometimes you get more power by giving it up

39:26.660 --> 39:30.540
 than by trying to hold on to every last piece of it.

39:30.540 --> 39:32.740
 Washington gives up power at the end of the revolution.

39:32.740 --> 39:34.460
 He's successfully carried

39:34.460 --> 39:35.940
 through the revolutionary war aims.

39:35.940 --> 39:38.460
 He's commander of the revolutionary forces

39:38.460 --> 39:40.020
 and he gives up his command.

39:40.020 --> 39:41.180
 And then of course he's president

39:41.180 --> 39:43.340
 and after two terms, he gives up his command.

39:43.340 --> 39:44.180
 What is he doing?

39:44.180 --> 39:46.100
 He's an ambitious person,

39:46.100 --> 39:49.540
 but he's recognizing that the most important currency

39:49.540 --> 39:53.620
 he has for power is his respected status

39:53.620 --> 39:55.420
 as a disinterested statesman.

39:56.580 --> 39:58.580
 That's really what his power is.

39:58.580 --> 40:00.500
 And how does he further that power?

40:00.500 --> 40:03.360
 By showing that he doesn't crave power.

40:04.400 --> 40:05.620
 So he was self aware.

40:05.620 --> 40:06.840
 Very self aware of this

40:06.840 --> 40:10.300
 and very sophisticated in understanding this.

40:10.300 --> 40:14.620
 And I think there are many other leaders who recognize that.

40:14.620 --> 40:19.400
 You can look to, in some ways,

40:19.400 --> 40:20.980
 the story of many of our presidents

40:20.980 --> 40:24.100
 who even before there is a two term limit

40:24.100 --> 40:26.960
 in the constitution, leave after two terms.

40:26.960 --> 40:28.740
 They do that because they recognize

40:28.740 --> 40:31.400
 that their power is the power of being a statesman,

40:32.880 --> 40:34.260
 not of being a president.

40:34.260 --> 40:36.940
 I still wonder what kind of man it takes,

40:36.940 --> 40:39.560
 what kind of human being it takes to do that.

40:39.560 --> 40:43.940
 Because I've been studying Vladimir Putin quite a bit.

40:43.940 --> 40:44.780
 Right.

40:44.780 --> 40:49.780
 And he's still, I believe he still has popular support

40:51.500 --> 40:54.200
 that that's not fully manipulated.

40:54.200 --> 40:55.940
 Because I know a lot of people in Russia

40:55.940 --> 40:59.100
 and actually almost the entirety of my family in Russia

40:59.100 --> 41:01.140
 are big supporters of Putin.

41:01.140 --> 41:03.460
 And everybody I talk to sort of,

41:03.460 --> 41:05.460
 that's not just like on social media.

41:05.460 --> 41:06.300
 Right.

41:06.300 --> 41:08.140
 Like the people that live in Russia

41:08.140 --> 41:10.980
 seem to support him.

41:10.980 --> 41:15.980
 It feels like this will be in a George Washington way.

41:16.540 --> 41:19.820
 Now will be the time that Putin,

41:19.820 --> 41:22.580
 just like Yeltsin, could relinquish power.

41:22.580 --> 41:25.860
 And thereby, in the eyes of Russians,

41:25.860 --> 41:29.580
 become, in like the long arc of history,

41:29.580 --> 41:31.620
 be viewed as a great leader.

41:31.620 --> 41:34.500
 You look at the economic growth of Russia,

41:34.500 --> 41:36.220
 you look at the rescue from the collapse

41:36.220 --> 41:39.460
 of the Soviet Union and Russia finding its footing,

41:39.460 --> 41:44.020
 and then relinquishing power in a way that perhaps,

41:44.020 --> 41:48.080
 if Russia succeeds, forms a truly democratic state.

41:48.080 --> 41:49.940
 This would be how Putin can become

41:49.940 --> 41:52.660
 one of the great leaders in Russian history,

41:52.660 --> 41:55.860
 at least in the context of the 21st century.

41:55.860 --> 41:59.140
 I think there are two reasons why this is really hard

41:59.140 --> 42:01.420
 for Putin and for others.

42:01.420 --> 42:05.500
 One is the trappings of power are very seductive,

42:05.500 --> 42:07.280
 as you said before, they're corrupting.

42:07.280 --> 42:09.380
 This is a real problem, right?

42:09.380 --> 42:10.500
 If it's in the business context,

42:10.500 --> 42:13.060
 you don't wanna give up that private jet.

42:13.060 --> 42:14.500
 If it's in Putin's context,

42:14.500 --> 42:15.940
 it's billions of dollars every year

42:15.940 --> 42:19.520
 that he's able to take for himself or give to his friends.

42:19.520 --> 42:20.780
 It's not that he'll be poor if he leaves,

42:20.780 --> 42:21.940
 he'll still be rich,

42:21.940 --> 42:23.980
 and he has billions of dollars stored away,

42:23.980 --> 42:26.460
 but he won't be able to get the new billions.

42:26.460 --> 42:27.420
 And so that's part of it,

42:27.420 --> 42:30.300
 the trappings of power are a big deal.

42:30.300 --> 42:32.660
 And then second, in Putin's case in particular,

42:32.660 --> 42:34.960
 he has to be worried about what happens next.

42:34.960 --> 42:35.860
 Will he be tried?

42:35.860 --> 42:38.260
 Will someone try to come and arrest him?

42:38.260 --> 42:41.060
 Will someone try to come and assassinate him?

42:41.060 --> 42:44.900
 Washington recognized that leaving early

42:44.900 --> 42:48.780
 limited the corruption and limited the enemies that you made.

42:48.780 --> 42:50.740
 And so it was a strategic choice.

42:50.740 --> 42:53.100
 Putin is at this point bringing power too long.

42:53.100 --> 42:55.420
 And this comes back to your core insight.

42:55.420 --> 42:57.960
 It's a cliche, but it's true, power corrupts.

42:57.960 --> 42:59.320
 No one should have power for too long.

42:59.320 --> 43:00.860
 This was one of the best insights

43:00.860 --> 43:02.580
 the founders of the United States had,

43:02.580 --> 43:04.740
 that power was to be held for a short time

43:04.740 --> 43:07.160
 as a fiduciary responsibility,

43:07.160 --> 43:08.800
 not as something you owned, right?

43:08.800 --> 43:10.220
 This is the problem with monarchy,

43:10.220 --> 43:12.820
 with aristocracy, that you own power, right?

43:12.820 --> 43:16.320
 We don't own power, we're holding it in trust.

43:17.840 --> 43:22.060
 Yeah, there's some probably like very specific

43:22.060 --> 43:24.980
 psychological study of how many years it takes

43:24.980 --> 43:28.600
 for you to forget that you can't own power.

43:28.600 --> 43:29.440
 That's right.

43:29.440 --> 43:32.680
 That could be a much more rigorous discussion

43:32.680 --> 43:35.260
 about the length of terms that are appropriate,

43:35.260 --> 43:37.260
 but really there's an amount,

43:37.260 --> 43:39.380
 like Stalin had power for 30 years,

43:39.380 --> 43:42.720
 like Putin is pushing those that many years already.

43:44.100 --> 43:46.160
 There's a certain point where you forget

43:46.160 --> 43:48.420
 the person you were before you took the power.

43:48.420 --> 43:49.260
 That's right.

43:49.260 --> 43:52.100
 You forget to be humble in the face of this responsibility

43:52.100 --> 43:55.060
 and then there's no going back.

43:55.060 --> 43:55.900
 That's right.

43:55.900 --> 43:57.580
 And that's how dictators are born.

43:57.580 --> 44:01.780
 That's how the evil like authoritarians become evil

44:01.780 --> 44:05.880
 or let's not use the word evil,

44:05.880 --> 44:08.600
 but counterproductive, destructive

44:08.600 --> 44:11.720
 to the ideal that they initially

44:11.720 --> 44:13.340
 probably came to office with.

44:13.340 --> 44:14.180
 That's right.

44:14.180 --> 44:15.020
 That's right.

44:15.020 --> 44:16.360
 One of the core historical insights

44:16.360 --> 44:18.340
 is people should move jobs.

44:19.960 --> 44:21.720
 And this applies for CEOs probably.

44:21.720 --> 44:22.700
 Absolutely.

44:22.700 --> 44:24.320
 They can go become CEO somewhere else,

44:24.320 --> 44:26.520
 but don't stay CEO one place too long.

44:26.520 --> 44:27.860
 It's a problem with startups, right?

44:27.860 --> 44:29.880
 The founder, you can have a brilliant founder

44:29.880 --> 44:31.460
 and that founder doesn't want to let go.

44:31.460 --> 44:32.300
 Yeah.

44:32.300 --> 44:33.400
 Right, it's the same issue.

44:33.400 --> 44:35.800
 At the same time, I mean, this is where Elon Musk

44:35.800 --> 44:40.800
 and a few others like Larry Page and Sergey Brin

44:41.120 --> 44:42.900
 that stayed for quite a long time

44:42.900 --> 44:45.200
 and they actually were the beacon.

44:45.200 --> 44:48.920
 They, on their shoulders, carried the dream of the company

44:48.920 --> 44:51.120
 where everybody else doubted.

44:51.120 --> 44:54.660
 But that seems to be the exception versus the rule.

44:54.660 --> 44:57.640
 Well, and even Sergey, for example, has stepped back.

44:57.640 --> 44:59.580
 He plays less of a day to day role

44:59.580 --> 45:01.880
 and is not running Google in the way he did.

45:01.880 --> 45:04.480
 But the interesting thing is he stepped back

45:04.480 --> 45:07.640
 in a quite tragic way from what I've seen,

45:07.640 --> 45:12.400
 which is, I think Google's mission, initial mission

45:12.400 --> 45:15.560
 of making the world's information accessible to everybody

45:15.560 --> 45:17.880
 is one of the most beautiful missions of any company

45:17.880 --> 45:18.920
 in the history of the world.

45:18.920 --> 45:22.520
 I think it's what Google has done with the search engine

45:22.520 --> 45:25.500
 and other efforts that are similar,

45:25.500 --> 45:29.120
 like scanning a lot of books, it's just incredible.

45:29.120 --> 45:31.080
 It's similar to Wikipedia.

45:32.760 --> 45:37.760
 But what he said was that it's not the same company anymore.

45:38.040 --> 45:41.020
 And I know maybe I'm reading too much into it

45:41.020 --> 45:43.480
 because it's more maybe practically saying

45:43.480 --> 45:45.280
 just the size of the company is much larger,

45:45.280 --> 45:47.120
 the kind of leadership that's required.

45:47.120 --> 45:50.080
 But at the same time, they changed the model

45:50.080 --> 45:54.320
 from don't be evil to it's becoming corporatized

45:54.320 --> 45:56.920
 and all those kinds of things and it's sad.

45:56.920 --> 45:59.280
 There also are cycles, right?

45:59.280 --> 46:01.160
 History is about cycles, right?

46:01.160 --> 46:05.040
 There are cycles to life, there are cycles to organizations.

46:05.040 --> 46:05.880
 It's sad.

46:05.880 --> 46:08.200
 I mean, it's sad Steve Jobs leaving Apple

46:08.200 --> 46:10.700
 by passing away, sad.

46:11.520 --> 46:14.760
 You know, what the future of SpaceX and Tesla looks like

46:14.760 --> 46:16.920
 without Elon Musk is quite sad.

46:16.920 --> 46:18.640
 It's very possible that those companies

46:18.640 --> 46:20.360
 become something very different.

46:20.360 --> 46:24.360
 They become something much more like corporate

46:24.360 --> 46:28.920
 and stale, yeah.

46:28.920 --> 46:31.680
 So maybe most of the progress is made through cycles.

46:31.680 --> 46:33.320
 Maybe a new Elon Musk comes along

46:33.320 --> 46:35.500
 and all those kinds of things.

46:35.500 --> 46:39.560
 But it does seem that the American system of government

46:39.560 --> 46:44.560
 has built into it the cycling that makes it effective

46:46.080 --> 46:47.760
 and it makes it last very long.

46:47.760 --> 46:50.040
 It lasts a very long time, right?

46:50.040 --> 46:53.340
 It continues to excel and lead the world.

46:53.340 --> 46:55.280
 Sure, sure.

46:55.280 --> 46:56.320
 And let's hope it continues to.

46:56.320 --> 47:00.040
 No, I mean, we're into a third century

47:00.040 --> 47:03.680
 and democracies on this scale rarely last that long.

47:03.680 --> 47:07.320
 So that's a point of pride, but it also means

47:07.320 --> 47:09.240
 we need to be attentive to keep our house in order

47:09.240 --> 47:13.000
 because it's not inevitable that this experiment continues.

47:14.240 --> 47:17.160
 Now it's important to meditate on that actually.

47:17.160 --> 47:20.320
 You've mentioned that FDR, Franklin D. Roosevelt

47:20.320 --> 47:24.480
 is one of the great leaders in American history.

47:24.480 --> 47:25.560
 Why is that?

47:25.560 --> 47:29.600
 Franklin Roosevelt had the power of empathy.

47:29.600 --> 47:32.320
 No leader that I've ever studied or been around

47:32.320 --> 47:35.480
 or spent any time reading about was able to connect

47:35.480 --> 47:37.800
 with people who were so different from himself

47:37.800 --> 47:39.200
 as Franklin Roosevelt.

47:39.200 --> 47:40.960
 He came from the most elite family.

47:40.960 --> 47:43.260
 He never had to work for a paycheck in his life.

47:43.260 --> 47:44.900
 When he was president, he was still collecting

47:44.900 --> 47:46.640
 an allowance from his mom.

47:46.640 --> 47:49.660
 I mean, you couldn't be more elite than Franklin Roosevelt,

47:49.660 --> 47:52.280
 but he authentically connected.

47:52.280 --> 47:54.440
 This was not propaganda.

47:54.440 --> 47:57.780
 He was able to feel the pain and understand the lives

47:57.780 --> 48:00.760
 of some of the most destitute Americans

48:00.760 --> 48:02.040
 in other parts of the country.

48:02.040 --> 48:02.880
 It's interesting.

48:02.880 --> 48:06.360
 So through one of the hardest economic periods

48:06.360 --> 48:08.480
 of American history, he was able to feel the pain.

48:08.480 --> 48:10.520
 He was able to, the number of immigrants

48:10.520 --> 48:13.240
 I read oral histories from or who have written themselves,

48:13.240 --> 48:15.200
 Saul Bellow is one example, the great novelist

48:15.200 --> 48:17.480
 who talk about how as immigrants to the US,

48:17.480 --> 48:19.360
 Saul Bellow was a Russian Jewish immigrant.

48:19.360 --> 48:21.600
 He said, growing up in Chicago, politicians were all trying

48:21.600 --> 48:22.440
 to steal from us.

48:22.440 --> 48:25.200
 I didn't think any of them cared until I heard FDR.

48:25.200 --> 48:26.980
 And I knew he spoke to me.

48:27.920 --> 48:31.520
 And I think part of it was FDR really tried

48:31.520 --> 48:32.480
 to understand people.

48:32.480 --> 48:33.680
 That's the first thing, he was humble enough

48:33.680 --> 48:34.960
 to try to do that.

48:34.960 --> 48:36.520
 But second, he had a talent for that.

48:36.520 --> 48:38.900
 And it's hard to know exactly what it was,

48:38.900 --> 48:40.600
 but he had a talent for putting himself,

48:40.600 --> 48:43.740
 imagining himself in someone else's shoes.

48:43.740 --> 48:48.200
 What stands out to you as important?

48:48.200 --> 48:51.720
 I mean, so he was, he went through the great depression.

48:51.720 --> 48:54.880
 The, so the new deal, which some people criticize,

48:54.880 --> 48:57.760
 some people see, I mean, it's funny to look at some

48:57.760 --> 49:02.760
 of these policies and their long ripple effects.

49:03.400 --> 49:08.040
 But at the time, it's some of the most innovative policies

49:08.040 --> 49:09.320
 in the history of America.

49:09.320 --> 49:12.300
 You could say they're ultimately not good for America,

49:12.300 --> 49:16.000
 but they're nevertheless hold within them very rich

49:16.000 --> 49:17.560
 and important lessons.

49:17.560 --> 49:20.680
 But the new deal, obviously World War II,

49:20.680 --> 49:23.400
 that entire process, is there something that stands out

49:23.400 --> 49:28.400
 to you as a particularly great moment that made FDR?

49:30.080 --> 49:34.860
 Yes, I think what FDR does from his first 100 days

49:34.860 --> 49:38.840
 in office forward, and this begins with his fireside chats,

49:38.840 --> 49:43.400
 is he helps Americans to see that they're all in it together.

49:43.400 --> 49:46.720
 And that's by creating hope and creating a sense

49:46.720 --> 49:49.320
 of common suffering and common mission.

49:49.320 --> 49:51.200
 It's not offering simple solutions.

49:51.200 --> 49:52.960
 One of the lessons from FDR is,

49:52.960 --> 49:54.320
 if you wanna bring people together,

49:54.320 --> 49:56.160
 don't offer a simple solution.

49:56.160 --> 49:57.920
 Because as soon as I offer a simple solution,

49:57.920 --> 50:00.080
 I have people for it and against it.

50:00.080 --> 50:00.960
 Don't do that.

50:00.960 --> 50:04.040
 Explain the problem, frame the problem,

50:04.040 --> 50:05.940
 and then give people a mission.

50:05.940 --> 50:10.200
 So Roosevelt's first radio address in March of 1933,

50:10.200 --> 50:12.400
 the banking system is collapsing.

50:12.400 --> 50:13.600
 And we can't imagine it, right?

50:13.600 --> 50:16.400
 Banks were closing and you couldn't get your money out.

50:16.400 --> 50:17.960
 Your life savings would be lost, right?

50:17.960 --> 50:20.440
 We can't imagine that happening in our world today.

50:20.440 --> 50:22.520
 He comes on the radio, he takes five minutes

50:22.520 --> 50:24.360
 to explain how banking works.

50:24.360 --> 50:26.560
 Most people didn't understand how banking worked, right?

50:26.560 --> 50:28.400
 They don't actually hold your money in a vault.

50:28.400 --> 50:30.320
 They lend it out to someone else.

50:30.320 --> 50:33.520
 And then he explains why if you go and take your money

50:33.520 --> 50:35.000
 out of the bank and put it in your mattress,

50:35.000 --> 50:36.840
 you're making it worse for yourself.

50:36.840 --> 50:38.400
 He explains this.

50:38.400 --> 50:40.960
 And then he says, I don't have a solution,

50:40.960 --> 50:42.240
 but here's what I'm gonna do.

50:42.240 --> 50:46.680
 I'm gonna send in government officers to examine the banks

50:46.680 --> 50:48.520
 and show you the books on the banks.

50:48.520 --> 50:50.520
 And I want you to help me by going

50:50.520 --> 50:52.400
 and putting your money back in the bank.

50:52.400 --> 50:54.160
 We're all gonna do this together.

50:54.160 --> 50:56.680
 No simple solution, no ideological statement,

50:56.680 --> 50:58.420
 but a sense of common mission.

50:58.420 --> 51:00.180
 Let's go out and do this together.

51:00.180 --> 51:03.420
 When you read as I have so many of these oral histories

51:03.420 --> 51:06.000
 and memoirs for people who lived through that period,

51:06.000 --> 51:08.400
 many of them disagreed with some of his policies.

51:08.400 --> 51:10.260
 Many of them thought he was too close to Jews

51:10.260 --> 51:11.600
 and they didn't like the fact he had a woman

51:11.600 --> 51:15.560
 in his cabinet and all that, but they felt he cared.

51:15.560 --> 51:18.300
 And they felt they were part of some common mission.

51:18.300 --> 51:20.520
 And when they talk about their experience fighting

51:20.520 --> 51:22.980
 in World War II, whether in Europe or Asia,

51:22.980 --> 51:24.380
 it was that that prepared them.

51:24.380 --> 51:26.040
 They knew what it meant to be an American

51:26.040 --> 51:27.960
 when they were over there.

51:27.960 --> 51:30.560
 So that to me is a model of leadership.

51:30.560 --> 51:33.520
 And I think that's as possible today as it's ever been.

51:33.520 --> 51:37.280
 So you think it's possible, like I was going to ask this,

51:37.280 --> 51:41.760
 again, it may be a very shallow view,

51:41.760 --> 51:45.200
 but it feels like this country is more divided

51:45.200 --> 51:48.560
 than it has been in recent history.

51:48.560 --> 51:51.520
 Perhaps the social media and all those kinds of things

51:51.520 --> 51:54.300
 are merely revealing the division

51:54.300 --> 51:56.360
 as opposed to creating the division.

51:56.360 --> 52:00.080
 But is it possible to have a leader

52:00.080 --> 52:03.880
 that unites in the same way that FDR did without,

52:03.880 --> 52:06.280
 well, we're living through a pandemic.

52:06.280 --> 52:09.420
 This is already, so like, I was going to say

52:09.420 --> 52:12.560
 without suffering, but this is economic suffering.

52:12.560 --> 52:14.240
 A huge number of people have lost their job.

52:14.240 --> 52:18.260
 So is it possible to have, is there one a hunger?

52:18.260 --> 52:21.320
 Is there a possibility to have an FDR style leader

52:21.320 --> 52:22.920
 who unites?

52:22.920 --> 52:25.680
 Yes, I think that is what President Biden is trying.

52:25.680 --> 52:27.680
 I'm not saying he'll succeed,

52:27.680 --> 52:29.420
 but I think that's what he's trying to do.

52:29.420 --> 52:31.760
 The way you do this is you do not allow yourself

52:31.760 --> 52:35.100
 to be captured by your opponents in Congress

52:35.100 --> 52:36.080
 or somewhere else.

52:36.080 --> 52:38.000
 FDR had a lot of opponents in Congress.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.960
 He had a lot of opponents in politics,

52:39.960 --> 52:41.840
 governors and others who didn't like him.

52:41.840 --> 52:44.040
 Herbert Hoover was still around

52:44.040 --> 52:47.200
 and still accusing FDR of being a conspiratist

52:47.200 --> 52:48.240
 and all these other things.

52:48.240 --> 52:52.100
 So you don't allow yourself to be captured

52:52.100 --> 52:53.380
 by the leaders of the other side.

52:53.380 --> 52:55.760
 You go over their heads to the people.

52:55.760 --> 52:59.340
 And so today, the way to do this is to explain to people

52:59.340 --> 53:01.700
 and empathize with the suffering and dislocation

53:01.700 --> 53:03.600
 and difficulties they're dealing with

53:03.600 --> 53:05.860
 and show that you're trying to help them.

53:05.860 --> 53:08.760
 Not an easy solution, not a simple statement,

53:08.760 --> 53:11.340
 but here are some things we can all do together.

53:11.340 --> 53:13.620
 That's why I think infrastructure makes a lot of sense.

53:13.620 --> 53:15.960
 It's what FDR invested into, right?

53:15.960 --> 53:17.400
 FDR built Hoover Dam.

53:17.400 --> 53:20.600
 Hoover Dam turned the lights on for young Lyndon Johnson

53:20.600 --> 53:22.720
 who grew up outside of Austin, right?

53:22.720 --> 53:25.720
 FDR was the one who invested in road construction

53:25.720 --> 53:28.480
 that was then continued by Dwight Eisenhower,

53:28.480 --> 53:31.800
 by a Republican with the interstate highway system, right?

53:31.800 --> 53:34.480
 FDR invested through the WPA in building thousands

53:34.480 --> 53:37.020
 of schools in our country, planting trees.

53:37.020 --> 53:40.460
 That's the kind of work that can bring people together.

53:40.460 --> 53:42.600
 You don't have to be a Democrat or a Republican to say,

53:42.600 --> 53:45.380
 you know what, we'd be a lot better off in my community

53:45.380 --> 53:47.540
 if we had better infrastructure today.

53:47.540 --> 53:48.440
 I wanna be a part of that.

53:48.440 --> 53:49.960
 Oh, well, maybe I can get a job doing that.

53:49.960 --> 53:52.800
 Maybe my company can benefit from that.

53:52.800 --> 53:54.560
 You bring people together and that way

53:54.560 --> 53:56.520
 it becomes a common mission,

53:56.520 --> 53:59.200
 even if we have different ideological positions.

53:59.200 --> 54:00.120
 Yeah, it's funny.

54:01.560 --> 54:03.760
 When I first heard Joe Biden,

54:05.100 --> 54:08.560
 many years ago, I think he ran for president against Obama.

54:08.560 --> 54:09.400
 That's correct.

54:10.920 --> 54:13.800
 Before I heard him speak, I really liked him.

54:13.800 --> 54:15.560
 But once I heard him speak,

54:15.560 --> 54:17.800
 I started liking him less and less.

54:17.800 --> 54:21.000
 And it speaks to something interesting,

54:21.000 --> 54:22.680
 where it's hard to put into words

54:22.680 --> 54:24.940
 why you connect with people.

54:24.940 --> 54:27.400
 The empathy that you mentioned in FDR,

54:27.400 --> 54:31.240
 you have these bad, pardon the French, motherfuckers

54:31.240 --> 54:33.900
 like Teddy Roosevelt that connect with you.

54:33.900 --> 54:35.920
 There's something just powerful.

54:35.920 --> 54:39.000
 And with Joe Biden, I wanna really like him.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.740
 And there's something not quite there

54:41.740 --> 54:45.500
 where it feels like he doesn't quite know my pain,

54:45.500 --> 54:49.600
 even though he, on paper, is exactly,

54:49.600 --> 54:50.980
 he knows the pain of the people

54:50.980 --> 54:52.440
 and there's something not connecting.

54:52.440 --> 54:53.800
 And it's hard to explain.

54:53.800 --> 54:55.160
 It's hard to put into words.

54:55.160 --> 54:57.640
 And it makes me not,

55:00.040 --> 55:01.680
 as an engineer and scientist,

55:01.680 --> 55:04.680
 it makes me not feel good about presidencies

55:04.680 --> 55:08.760
 because it makes me feel like it's more art than science.

55:08.760 --> 55:09.600
 It is an art.

55:09.600 --> 55:11.320
 And I think it's exactly an art

55:11.320 --> 55:13.280
 for the reasons you laid out, it's aesthetic.

55:13.280 --> 55:14.840
 It's about feeling, it's about emotion,

55:14.840 --> 55:16.180
 all the things that we can't engineer.

55:16.180 --> 55:18.960
 We've tried for centuries to engineer emotion.

55:18.960 --> 55:19.880
 We're never gonna do it.

55:19.880 --> 55:20.720
 Don't try it.

55:20.720 --> 55:21.680
 I'm a parent of teenagers.

55:21.680 --> 55:24.080
 Don't even try to explain emotion.

55:24.080 --> 55:26.120
 But you hit on the key point

55:26.120 --> 55:27.160
 and the key challenge for Biden.

55:27.160 --> 55:28.860
 He's gotta find the right words.

55:28.860 --> 55:32.400
 It's not finding the words to bullshit people.

55:32.400 --> 55:34.360
 It's finding the words to help express.

55:34.360 --> 55:36.640
 We've all felt empowered and felt good.

55:36.640 --> 55:38.640
 When someone uses words

55:38.640 --> 55:41.060
 that put into words what we're feeling,

55:41.060 --> 55:41.900
 that's what he needs.

55:41.900 --> 55:42.960
 That's the job of a leader.

55:42.960 --> 55:44.560
 And there's certain words,

55:44.560 --> 55:47.020
 I haven't heard many politicians use those words,

55:47.020 --> 55:49.760
 but there's certain words that make you forget

55:49.760 --> 55:54.760
 that you're for immigration or against immigration.

55:54.840 --> 55:57.880
 Make you forget whether you're for wars and against wars.

55:57.880 --> 56:00.600
 Make you forget about the bickering

56:00.600 --> 56:04.320
 and somehow inspire you, elevate you

56:04.320 --> 56:07.040
 to believe in the greatness that this country could be.

56:07.040 --> 56:08.200
 Yes.

56:08.200 --> 56:11.240
 In that same way, the reason I moved to Austin,

56:11.240 --> 56:15.240
 it's funny to say, I just heard words

56:15.240 --> 56:17.520
 from people, from friends,

56:17.520 --> 56:21.840
 where they're excited by the possibility of the future here.

56:21.840 --> 56:24.760
 I wasn't thinking like, what's the right thing to do?

56:24.760 --> 56:26.200
 What's the strategic,

56:26.200 --> 56:28.080
 cause I wanna launch a business.

56:28.080 --> 56:30.040
 There's a lot of arguments for San Francisco

56:30.040 --> 56:32.360
 or maybe staying in Boston in my case,

56:32.360 --> 56:37.080
 but there's this excitement that was beyond reason.

56:37.080 --> 56:38.040
 That was emotional.

56:38.040 --> 56:38.880
 Yes, yes.

56:38.880 --> 56:40.800
 And that's what it seems like.

56:40.800 --> 56:43.840
 That's what builds, that's what great leaders do,

56:43.840 --> 56:45.200
 but that's what builds countries.

56:45.200 --> 56:47.720
 That's what builds great businesses.

56:47.720 --> 56:48.560
 That's right.

56:48.560 --> 56:50.160
 And it's what people say about Austin,

56:50.160 --> 56:51.640
 for example, all the time.

56:51.640 --> 56:54.080
 A talented people who come here like yourself.

56:54.080 --> 56:55.240
 And here's the interesting thing.

56:55.240 --> 56:56.760
 No one person creates that.

56:56.760 --> 56:58.200
 The words emerge.

56:58.200 --> 57:00.240
 And part of what FDR understood,

57:00.240 --> 57:03.200
 you've got to find the words out there and use them.

57:03.200 --> 57:05.880
 You don't have to be the creator of them.

57:05.880 --> 57:08.200
 Just as the great painter doesn't invent the painting,

57:08.200 --> 57:10.320
 they're taking things from others.

57:10.320 --> 57:11.640
 As a small aside,

57:11.640 --> 57:15.080
 is there something you could say about FDR

57:15.080 --> 57:16.480
 and Hitler?

57:19.240 --> 57:21.480
 I constantly tried to think,

57:21.480 --> 57:23.880
 can this person, can this moment in history

57:23.880 --> 57:28.880
 have been circumvented, prevented?

57:29.320 --> 57:31.600
 Can Hitler have been stopped?

57:31.600 --> 57:34.800
 Can some of the atrocities from my own family

57:34.800 --> 57:37.560
 that my grandparents had to live through

57:37.560 --> 57:39.840
 the starvation in the Soviet Union,

57:39.840 --> 57:42.400
 so the thing that people don't often talk about

57:42.400 --> 57:45.320
 is the atrocities committed by Stalin and his own people.

57:46.840 --> 57:51.840
 It feels like here's this great leader, FDR,

57:53.560 --> 57:58.560
 that had the chance to have an impact on the world

57:59.320 --> 58:04.320
 that he already probably had a great positive impact,

58:05.320 --> 58:09.920
 but had a chance to stop maybe World War II

58:09.920 --> 58:12.040
 or stop some of the evils.

58:12.040 --> 58:14.400
 When you look at how weak Hitler was

58:14.400 --> 58:17.760
 from much of the 30s relative to militarily,

58:17.760 --> 58:19.560
 relative to everything else,

58:19.560 --> 58:22.320
 how many people could have done a lot to stop him?

58:23.320 --> 58:26.600
 And FDR in particular didn't.

58:26.600 --> 58:31.040
 He tried to play, not pacify,

58:31.040 --> 58:36.040
 but basically do diplomacy and let Germany do Germany,

58:36.760 --> 58:40.080
 let Europe do Europe, and focus on America.

58:40.080 --> 58:42.240
 Is there something you would,

58:42.240 --> 58:44.640
 would you hold his feet to the fire on this?

58:44.640 --> 58:47.560
 Or is it very difficult from the perspective of FDR

58:47.560 --> 58:49.640
 to have known what was coming?

58:50.440 --> 58:52.600
 I think FDR had a sense of what was coming,

58:52.600 --> 58:55.080
 not quite the enormity of what Hitler was doing

58:55.080 --> 58:57.360
 and not quite the enormity of what the Holocaust became.

58:57.360 --> 58:59.440
 I also lost relatives in the Holocaust.

59:01.640 --> 59:04.440
 And part of that was beyond the imagination of human beings.

59:04.440 --> 59:08.640
 But it's clear in his papers that as early as 1934,

59:08.640 --> 59:10.360
 people he respected, who he knew well,

59:10.360 --> 59:12.320
 told him that Hitler was very dangerous.

59:12.320 --> 59:15.200
 They also thought Hitler was crazy, that he was a lunatic.

59:15.200 --> 59:18.840
 Hamilton Fish Armstrong, who was a friend of Roosevelt's,

59:18.840 --> 59:20.400
 who was actually the Council on Foreign Relations

59:20.400 --> 59:22.520
 in New York, had a meeting with Hitler in 1934.

59:22.520 --> 59:24.920
 I remember reading the account of this.

59:24.920 --> 59:25.960
 And he basically said to FDR,

59:25.960 --> 59:27.520
 this man is gonna cause a war.

59:27.520 --> 59:28.680
 He's gonna cause a lot of damage.

59:28.680 --> 59:30.600
 Again, they didn't know quite the scale.

59:30.600 --> 59:32.320
 So they saw this coming.

59:32.320 --> 59:33.520
 They saw this coming.

59:33.520 --> 59:34.960
 FDR had two problems.

59:34.960 --> 59:38.720
 First, he had an American public that was deeply isolationist.

59:38.720 --> 59:40.280
 The opposite of the problem in a sense

59:40.280 --> 59:41.480
 that we were talking about before.

59:41.480 --> 59:43.600
 If we're an over militarized society,

59:43.600 --> 59:47.840
 now we were a deeply isolationist society in the 1930s.

59:47.840 --> 59:49.520
 The depression reinforced that.

59:49.520 --> 59:52.160
 FDR actually had to break the law in the late 30s

59:52.160 --> 59:53.800
 to support the allies.

59:53.800 --> 59:57.360
 So it was very hard to move the country in that direction,

59:57.360 --> 59:59.920
 especially when he had this program at home,

59:59.920 --> 1:00:01.480
 the New Deal, that he didn't wanna jeopardize

1:00:01.480 --> 1:00:03.840
 by alienating an isolationist public.

1:00:03.840 --> 1:00:04.680
 That was the reality.

1:00:04.680 --> 1:00:06.000
 We talked about political manipulation.

1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:07.640
 He had to be conscious of that.

1:00:07.640 --> 1:00:09.080
 He had to know his audience.

1:00:09.080 --> 1:00:12.160
 And second, there were no allies willing

1:00:12.160 --> 1:00:14.600
 to invest in this either.

1:00:14.600 --> 1:00:18.080
 The British were as committed to appeasement, as you know.

1:00:18.080 --> 1:00:19.760
 You're obviously very knowledgeable about this.

1:00:19.760 --> 1:00:21.240
 The French were as well.

1:00:21.240 --> 1:00:22.080
 It was very hard.

1:00:22.080 --> 1:00:23.760
 The Russian government, the Soviet government

1:00:23.760 --> 1:00:26.920
 was cooperating to remilitarize Germany.

1:00:26.920 --> 1:00:30.000
 So there weren't a lot of allies out there either.

1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:33.520
 I think if there's a criticism to be made of FDR,

1:00:33.520 --> 1:00:35.720
 it's that once we're in the war,

1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:39.160
 he didn't do enough to stop,

1:00:39.160 --> 1:00:41.280
 in particular, the killing of Jews.

1:00:41.280 --> 1:00:42.920
 And there are a number of historians,

1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:44.520
 myself included, who have written about this,

1:00:44.520 --> 1:00:45.600
 and it's an endless debate.

1:00:45.600 --> 1:00:47.000
 What should he have done?

1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:49.080
 There's no doubt by 1944,

1:00:49.080 --> 1:00:51.280
 the United States had air superiority

1:00:51.280 --> 1:00:53.480
 and could have bombed the rail lines to Auschwitz

1:00:53.480 --> 1:00:54.320
 and other camps,

1:00:54.320 --> 1:00:56.160
 and that would have saved as many as a million Jews.

1:00:56.160 --> 1:00:58.680
 That's a lot of people who could have been saved.

1:00:58.680 --> 1:01:01.680
 Why didn't FDR insist on that?

1:01:01.680 --> 1:01:04.200
 In part, because he wanted to use every resource possible

1:01:04.200 --> 1:01:05.520
 to win the war.

1:01:05.520 --> 1:01:08.400
 He did not want to be accused of fighting the war for Jews.

1:01:08.400 --> 1:01:09.640
 But I think it's also fair to say

1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:13.400
 that he probably cared less about Jews and East Europeans

1:01:13.400 --> 1:01:15.320
 than he did about others,

1:01:15.320 --> 1:01:18.240
 those of his own Dutch ancestry and from Western Europe.

1:01:18.240 --> 1:01:20.520
 And so, even their race comes in,

1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:22.840
 is also the explanation for the internment of Japanese

1:01:22.840 --> 1:01:23.680
 in the United States,

1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:24.680
 which is a horrible war crime

1:01:24.680 --> 1:01:26.920
 committed by this heroic president.

1:01:26.920 --> 1:01:29.680
 120,000 Japanese American citizens

1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:31.440
 lost their freedom unnecessarily.

1:01:31.440 --> 1:01:33.400
 So, he had his limitations.

1:01:33.400 --> 1:01:36.400
 And I think he could have done more during the war

1:01:37.440 --> 1:01:38.920
 to save many more lives.

1:01:38.920 --> 1:01:39.880
 And I wish he had.

1:01:39.880 --> 1:01:42.600
 And there's something to be said about empathy

1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:45.800
 that you spoke that FDR had empathy.

1:01:45.800 --> 1:01:47.160
 But us, for example,

1:01:47.160 --> 1:01:49.800
 now there's many people who describe the atrocities

1:01:49.800 --> 1:01:51.760
 happening in China.

1:01:51.760 --> 1:01:53.960
 And there's a bunch of places across the world

1:01:53.960 --> 1:01:55.600
 where there's atrocities happening now.

1:01:55.600 --> 1:01:57.520
 And we care.

1:01:57.520 --> 1:02:02.520
 We do not uniformly apply how much we care

1:02:03.300 --> 1:02:04.780
 for the suffering of others.

1:02:04.780 --> 1:02:05.620
 That's correct.

1:02:05.620 --> 1:02:06.660
 Depending on the group.

1:02:06.660 --> 1:02:07.620
 That's correct.

1:02:07.620 --> 1:02:10.580
 And in some sense, the role of the president

1:02:10.580 --> 1:02:15.580
 is to rise above that natural human inclination

1:02:15.860 --> 1:02:18.220
 to protect, to do the us versus them,

1:02:18.220 --> 1:02:20.660
 to protect the inner circle

1:02:20.660 --> 1:02:22.780
 and empathize with the suffering of those

1:02:22.780 --> 1:02:24.660
 that are not like you.

1:02:24.660 --> 1:02:25.660
 That's correct.

1:02:25.660 --> 1:02:26.660
 I agree with that.

1:02:26.660 --> 1:02:27.500
 Yeah.

1:02:29.300 --> 1:02:33.660
 Speaking of war, you wrote a book on Henry Kissinger.

1:02:33.660 --> 1:02:36.340
 It's not a great transition,

1:02:36.340 --> 1:02:38.080
 but it made sense in my head.

1:02:39.140 --> 1:02:41.660
 Who was Henry Kissinger as a man

1:02:41.660 --> 1:02:43.500
 and as a historical figure?

1:02:43.500 --> 1:02:45.940
 So Henry Kissinger to me is one of the most fascinating

1:02:45.940 --> 1:02:47.380
 figures in history,

1:02:47.380 --> 1:02:49.220
 because he comes to the United States

1:02:49.220 --> 1:02:51.620
 as a German Jewish immigrant at age 15,

1:02:51.620 --> 1:02:53.100
 speaking no English.

1:02:53.100 --> 1:02:56.520
 And within a few years, he's a major figure

1:02:56.520 --> 1:03:00.340
 influencing US foreign policy at the height of US power.

1:03:00.340 --> 1:03:01.500
 But while he's doing that,

1:03:01.500 --> 1:03:03.860
 he's never elected to office

1:03:03.860 --> 1:03:06.820
 and he's constantly reviled by people,

1:03:06.820 --> 1:03:10.420
 including people who are anti Semitic because he's Jewish,

1:03:10.420 --> 1:03:13.540
 but at the same time also his exoticism

1:03:13.540 --> 1:03:15.720
 makes him more attractive to people.

1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:18.800
 So someone like Nelson Rockefeller wants Kissinger around.

1:03:18.800 --> 1:03:20.220
 He's one of Kissinger's first patrons

1:03:20.220 --> 1:03:22.100
 because he wants a really smart Jew.

1:03:22.100 --> 1:03:23.580
 And Kissinger is gonna be that smart Jew

1:03:23.580 --> 1:03:25.260
 I call Kissinger a policy Jew.

1:03:25.260 --> 1:03:27.420
 There were these court Jews in the 16th and 17th

1:03:27.420 --> 1:03:28.460
 and 18th centuries in Europe.

1:03:28.460 --> 1:03:31.200
 Every king wanted the Jew to manage his banking.

1:03:31.200 --> 1:03:33.020
 And in a sense in the United States

1:03:33.020 --> 1:03:35.100
 in the second half of the 20th century,

1:03:35.100 --> 1:03:36.780
 many presidents want a Jew

1:03:36.780 --> 1:03:38.540
 to manage their international affairs.

1:03:38.540 --> 1:03:39.460
 And what does that really mean?

1:03:39.460 --> 1:03:41.460
 It's not just about being Jewish,

1:03:41.460 --> 1:03:44.260
 it's the internationalism, it's the cosmopolitanism.

1:03:44.260 --> 1:03:45.380
 And that's one of the things

1:03:45.380 --> 1:03:47.020
 I was fascinated with with Kissinger.

1:03:47.020 --> 1:03:48.800
 Someone like Kissinger is unthinkable

1:03:48.800 --> 1:03:50.780
 as a powerful figure in the United States

1:03:50.780 --> 1:03:52.420
 30 or 40 years earlier,

1:03:52.420 --> 1:03:54.100
 because the United States is run by WASD.

1:03:54.100 --> 1:03:56.380
 It's run by white elites

1:03:56.380 --> 1:03:58.780
 who come from a certain background.

1:03:58.780 --> 1:04:01.340
 Kissinger represents a moment when American society

1:04:01.340 --> 1:04:03.300
 opens up not to everyone,

1:04:03.300 --> 1:04:05.900
 but opens up to these cosmopolitan figures

1:04:05.900 --> 1:04:08.620
 who have language skills, historical knowledge,

1:04:08.620 --> 1:04:11.620
 networks that can be used for the US government

1:04:11.620 --> 1:04:14.600
 when after World War II, we have to rebuild Europe,

1:04:14.600 --> 1:04:16.360
 when we have to negotiate with the Soviet Union,

1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:19.360
 when we need the kinds of knowledge we didn't have before.

1:04:19.360 --> 1:04:22.020
 And Harvard where he gets his education late,

1:04:22.020 --> 1:04:23.460
 he started at City College actually,

1:04:23.460 --> 1:04:25.580
 but Harvard where he gets his education late

1:04:25.580 --> 1:04:26.980
 is at the center of what's happening

1:04:26.980 --> 1:04:28.300
 at all these major universities,

1:04:28.300 --> 1:04:29.640
 at Harvard, at Yale, at Stanford,

1:04:29.640 --> 1:04:31.780
 at the University of Texas, everywhere,

1:04:31.780 --> 1:04:34.940
 where they're growing in their international affairs,

1:04:34.940 --> 1:04:36.400
 bringing in the kinds of people

1:04:36.400 --> 1:04:38.580
 who never would be at the university before,

1:04:38.580 --> 1:04:42.660
 training them and then enlisting them in Cold War activities.

1:04:42.660 --> 1:04:46.100
 And so Kissinger is a representative of that phenomenon.

1:04:46.100 --> 1:04:47.580
 I became interested in him

1:04:47.580 --> 1:04:48.940
 because I think he's a bellwether.

1:04:48.940 --> 1:04:52.820
 He shows how power has changed in the United States.

1:04:52.820 --> 1:04:57.340
 So he enters this whole world of politics,

1:04:57.340 --> 1:05:00.300
 what, post World War II in the 50s?

1:05:00.300 --> 1:05:03.540
 Yes, so he actually, in the 40s even,

1:05:03.540 --> 1:05:05.060
 it's an extraordinary story.

1:05:05.060 --> 1:05:07.540
 He comes to the United States in 1938,

1:05:07.540 --> 1:05:09.940
 just before Kristallnacht, his family leaves.

1:05:09.940 --> 1:05:11.920
 He actually grew up right outside of Nuremberg.

1:05:11.920 --> 1:05:16.220
 They leave right before Kristallnacht in fall of 38,

1:05:16.220 --> 1:05:17.500
 come to New York.

1:05:17.500 --> 1:05:21.020
 He originally works in a brush factory, cleaning brushes,

1:05:21.020 --> 1:05:23.240
 goes to a public high school.

1:05:23.240 --> 1:05:27.300
 And in 1942, just after Pearl Harbor, he joins the military.

1:05:27.300 --> 1:05:30.380
 And he's very quickly in the military,

1:05:30.380 --> 1:05:33.420
 first of all, given citizenship, which he didn't have before.

1:05:34.340 --> 1:05:36.700
 He's sent for the first time outside of a kosher home.

1:05:36.700 --> 1:05:38.220
 He had been in a kosher home his entire life.

1:05:38.220 --> 1:05:41.380
 He's sent to South Carolina to eat ham for Uncle Sam.

1:05:42.260 --> 1:05:45.020
 And then he is, and this is extraordinary,

1:05:45.020 --> 1:05:48.900
 at the age of 20, barely speaking English,

1:05:48.900 --> 1:05:52.500
 he is sent back to Germany with the US Army

1:05:52.500 --> 1:05:55.580
 in an elite counterintelligence role, why?

1:05:55.580 --> 1:05:57.700
 Because they need German speakers.

1:05:57.700 --> 1:05:58.740
 He came when he was 15,

1:05:58.740 --> 1:06:00.260
 so he actually understands the society.

1:06:00.260 --> 1:06:02.500
 They need people who have that cultural knowledge.

1:06:02.500 --> 1:06:04.460
 And because he's Jewish,

1:06:04.460 --> 1:06:06.660
 they can trust that he'll be anti Nazi.

1:06:07.700 --> 1:06:10.140
 And there's a whole group of these figures.

1:06:10.140 --> 1:06:11.340
 He's one of many.

1:06:11.340 --> 1:06:13.540
 And so he's in an elite circle.

1:06:13.540 --> 1:06:15.940
 He's discriminated against in New York.

1:06:15.940 --> 1:06:17.300
 When he goes to Harvard after that,

1:06:17.300 --> 1:06:19.380
 he can only live in a Jewish only dorm.

1:06:19.380 --> 1:06:20.220
 But at the same time,

1:06:20.220 --> 1:06:22.980
 he's in an elite policy role in counterintelligence.

1:06:22.980 --> 1:06:25.500
 He forms a network there that stays with him

1:06:25.500 --> 1:06:27.780
 the rest of his career.

1:06:27.780 --> 1:06:29.260
 There's a gentleman named Fritz Kramer,

1:06:29.260 --> 1:06:31.380
 who becomes a sponsor of his

1:06:31.380 --> 1:06:34.780
 in the emerging Pentagon Defense Department world.

1:06:34.780 --> 1:06:36.940
 And as early as the early 1950s,

1:06:36.940 --> 1:06:40.260
 he sent them to Korea to comment on affairs in Korea.

1:06:40.260 --> 1:06:42.980
 He becomes both an intellectual recognized

1:06:42.980 --> 1:06:44.260
 for his connections,

1:06:44.260 --> 1:06:46.500
 but also someone who policymakers wanna talk about.

1:06:46.500 --> 1:06:48.740
 His book on nuclear weapons, when it's written,

1:06:48.740 --> 1:06:51.660
 is given to President Eisenhower to read

1:06:51.660 --> 1:06:54.220
 because they say this is someone writing interesting things.

1:06:54.220 --> 1:06:56.460
 You should read what he says.

1:06:56.460 --> 1:06:57.860
 There's a certain aspect to him

1:06:57.860 --> 1:06:59.740
 that's kind of like Forrest Gump.

1:06:59.740 --> 1:07:02.060
 He seems to continuously be the right person

1:07:02.060 --> 1:07:03.820
 at the right time in the right place.

1:07:03.820 --> 1:07:04.660
 That's right.

1:07:04.660 --> 1:07:05.660
 Somehow finding him in this.

1:07:05.660 --> 1:07:07.660
 I don't wanna, you know,

1:07:07.660 --> 1:07:11.500
 you can only get lucky so many times

1:07:11.500 --> 1:07:13.540
 because he continues to get lucky

1:07:13.540 --> 1:07:17.060
 in terms of being at the right place in history

1:07:17.060 --> 1:07:19.500
 for many decades, until today.

1:07:19.500 --> 1:07:21.140
 Yeah, well, he has a knack for that.

1:07:21.140 --> 1:07:23.500
 I spent a lot of time talking with him.

1:07:24.580 --> 1:07:27.940
 And what comes through very quickly

1:07:27.940 --> 1:07:29.700
 is that he has an eye for power.

1:07:30.620 --> 1:07:31.820
 It's, I think, unhealthy.

1:07:31.820 --> 1:07:33.220
 He's obsessed with power.

1:07:33.220 --> 1:07:36.380
 Can you explain like an observer of power

1:07:36.380 --> 1:07:39.500
 or does he want power himself?

1:07:39.500 --> 1:07:41.140
 Yes, both of those things.

1:07:41.140 --> 1:07:41.980
 Both of those.

1:07:41.980 --> 1:07:43.940
 And I think I explained this in the book.

1:07:43.940 --> 1:07:46.180
 He doesn't agree with what I'm gonna say now,

1:07:46.180 --> 1:07:47.980
 but I think I'm right and I think he's right.

1:07:47.980 --> 1:07:50.740
 It's very hard to analyze yourself, right?

1:07:50.740 --> 1:07:54.380
 I think he develops an obsession with gaining power

1:07:54.380 --> 1:07:57.660
 because he sees what happens when you have no power.

1:07:57.660 --> 1:08:00.180
 He experiences the trauma.

1:08:00.180 --> 1:08:04.980
 His father is a very respected Gymnasium Lehrer in Germany.

1:08:04.980 --> 1:08:06.420
 Even though he's Jewish,

1:08:06.420 --> 1:08:09.460
 he's actually the teacher of German classics

1:08:09.460 --> 1:08:11.180
 to the German kids.

1:08:11.180 --> 1:08:12.020
 That's great.

1:08:12.020 --> 1:08:15.580
 And he's forced to flee and he becomes nothing.

1:08:15.580 --> 1:08:17.900
 His father never really makes a way

1:08:17.900 --> 1:08:18.980
 for himself in the United States.

1:08:18.980 --> 1:08:21.100
 He becomes a postal delivery person,

1:08:21.100 --> 1:08:22.100
 which is nothing wrong with that,

1:08:22.100 --> 1:08:25.260
 but for someone who's a respected teacher in Germany,

1:08:25.260 --> 1:08:27.820
 and Gymnasium Lehrer are like professors there, right?

1:08:27.820 --> 1:08:29.380
 To then be in this position.

1:08:29.380 --> 1:08:31.300
 His mother has to open a catering business

1:08:31.300 --> 1:08:33.100
 when they come to New York.

1:08:33.100 --> 1:08:35.740
 It's a typical immigrant story, but he sees the trauma.

1:08:35.740 --> 1:08:38.260
 His grandparents are killed by the Nazis.

1:08:38.260 --> 1:08:41.940
 So he sees the trauma and he realizes how perilous it is

1:08:41.940 --> 1:08:43.060
 to be without power.

1:08:43.060 --> 1:08:46.500
 And you're saying he does not want to acknowledge

1:08:46.500 --> 1:08:48.180
 the effect of that?

1:08:49.060 --> 1:08:49.900
 It's hard.

1:08:49.900 --> 1:08:50.740
 It's hard.

1:08:50.740 --> 1:08:52.660
 I mean, most of us, if we've had trauma,

1:08:52.660 --> 1:08:54.260
 it's believable that it's traumatic

1:08:54.260 --> 1:08:55.180
 because you don't talk about it.

1:08:55.180 --> 1:08:58.980
 I have a friend who interviews combat veterans and he says,

1:08:58.980 --> 1:09:01.100
 as soon as someone freely wants to tell me

1:09:01.100 --> 1:09:02.660
 about their combat trauma,

1:09:02.660 --> 1:09:05.260
 I suspect that they're not telling me the truth.

1:09:05.260 --> 1:09:08.900
 If it's traumatic, it's hard to talk about.

1:09:08.900 --> 1:09:13.140
 Yeah, sometimes I wonder how much from my own life,

1:09:13.140 --> 1:09:15.740
 everything that I've ever done is just the result

1:09:15.740 --> 1:09:18.180
 of the complicated relationship with my father.

1:09:21.100 --> 1:09:23.180
 I tend to, I had a really difficult time.

1:09:23.180 --> 1:09:25.620
 I did a podcast conversation with him.

1:09:25.620 --> 1:09:26.460
 I saw it actually.

1:09:26.460 --> 1:09:27.420
 Yeah, it's great.

1:09:27.420 --> 1:09:28.780
 It's great.

1:09:28.780 --> 1:09:31.860
 It was, I was thinking I could never do that with my father.

1:09:31.860 --> 1:09:33.940
 But I remember as I was doing it,

1:09:33.940 --> 1:09:37.060
 and for months after I regretted doing it,

1:09:37.060 --> 1:09:39.140
 I just kept regretting it.

1:09:39.140 --> 1:09:42.300
 And the fact that I was regretting it spoke to the fact

1:09:42.300 --> 1:09:45.020
 that I'm running away from some truths

1:09:45.020 --> 1:09:47.700
 that are back there somewhere.

1:09:47.700 --> 1:09:50.540
 And that's perhaps what Kissinger is as well.

1:09:50.540 --> 1:09:53.180
 But is there, I mean, he's done,

1:09:53.180 --> 1:09:56.700
 he's been a part of so many interesting moments

1:09:56.700 --> 1:09:59.100
 of American history, of world history,

1:09:59.100 --> 1:10:03.420
 from the Cold War, Vietnam War, until today.

1:10:03.420 --> 1:10:07.220
 What stands out to you as a particularly important moment

1:10:08.500 --> 1:10:12.300
 in his career that made who he is?

1:10:13.740 --> 1:10:18.340
 Well, I think what made his career in many ways

1:10:18.340 --> 1:10:23.340
 was his experience in the 1950s, building a network,

1:10:23.620 --> 1:10:26.460
 a network of people across the world

1:10:26.460 --> 1:10:30.340
 who were rising leaders from unique positions.

1:10:30.340 --> 1:10:35.220
 He ran what he called the International Seminar at Harvard,

1:10:35.220 --> 1:10:37.300
 which was actually a summer school class

1:10:37.300 --> 1:10:39.340
 that no one at Harvard cared about.

1:10:39.340 --> 1:10:44.340
 But he invited all of these rising intellectuals

1:10:44.700 --> 1:10:46.780
 and thinkers from around the world.

1:10:46.780 --> 1:10:50.860
 And he built a network there that he used forevermore.

1:10:50.860 --> 1:10:53.980
 So that's what really, I think, boosts him.

1:10:53.980 --> 1:10:56.820
 The most important moments in terms of making his reputation

1:10:56.820 --> 1:10:59.340
 and making his career are two sets of activities.

1:10:59.340 --> 1:11:00.860
 One is the opening to China.

1:11:02.100 --> 1:11:04.580
 And his ability to, first of all,

1:11:04.580 --> 1:11:07.580
 take control of US policy without the authority to do that

1:11:07.580 --> 1:11:11.180
 and direct US policy, and then build a relationship

1:11:11.180 --> 1:11:14.580
 with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai that was unthinkable

1:11:14.580 --> 1:11:16.580
 just four or five years earlier.

1:11:16.580 --> 1:11:18.860
 Of course, President Nixon is a big part of that as well,

1:11:18.860 --> 1:11:20.780
 but Kissinger is the mover and shaker on that.

1:11:20.780 --> 1:11:23.660
 And it's a lot of manipulation, but it's also a vision.

1:11:23.660 --> 1:11:26.860
 Now, this is in the moment of American history

1:11:26.860 --> 1:11:29.660
 where there's a very powerful anti communism.

1:11:29.660 --> 1:11:30.500
 Correct.

1:11:30.500 --> 1:11:33.820
 So communism is seen as much more even though

1:11:33.820 --> 1:11:35.620
 than today as the enemy.

1:11:35.620 --> 1:11:36.460
 Correct.

1:11:36.460 --> 1:11:37.460
 And China in particular,

1:11:37.460 --> 1:11:40.700
 they were one of our key enemies in Vietnam.

1:11:40.700 --> 1:11:42.300
 And in Korea, American forces

1:11:42.300 --> 1:11:44.100
 were fighting Chinese forces directly.

1:11:44.100 --> 1:11:45.900
 Chinese forces come over the border.

1:11:46.780 --> 1:11:49.180
 Thousands of Americans die at the hand of Chinese forces.

1:11:49.180 --> 1:11:50.540
 So for the long time, the United States

1:11:50.540 --> 1:11:52.260
 had no relationship with communist China.

1:11:52.260 --> 1:11:54.460
 He opens that relationship.

1:11:54.460 --> 1:11:58.260
 And at the same time, he also creates a whole new dynamic

1:11:58.260 --> 1:11:59.420
 in the Middle East.

1:11:59.420 --> 1:12:02.340
 After the 1973 war, the so called Yom Kippur War,

1:12:02.340 --> 1:12:05.100
 he steps in and becomes the leading negotiator

1:12:05.100 --> 1:12:07.500
 between the Israelis, the Egyptians,

1:12:07.500 --> 1:12:09.980
 and other major actors in the region.

1:12:09.980 --> 1:12:12.780
 And it makes the United States the most powerful actor

1:12:12.780 --> 1:12:15.420
 in the Middle East, the Soviet Union far less powerful,

1:12:15.420 --> 1:12:17.940
 which is great for the United States in the 70s and 80s.

1:12:17.940 --> 1:12:19.420
 It gets us though into the problems

1:12:19.420 --> 1:12:21.780
 we of course have thereafter.

1:12:21.780 --> 1:12:25.460
 So that speaks to the very pragmatic approach

1:12:25.460 --> 1:12:28.740
 that he's taken the realistic approach

1:12:28.740 --> 1:12:33.740
 versus the idealistic approach termed realpolitik.

1:12:34.580 --> 1:12:35.780
 What is this thing?

1:12:35.780 --> 1:12:38.900
 What is this approach to world politics?

1:12:38.900 --> 1:12:43.500
 So realpolitik for Kissinger is really focusing

1:12:43.500 --> 1:12:46.980
 on the power centers in the world

1:12:46.980 --> 1:12:49.300
 and trying as best you can to manipulate

1:12:49.300 --> 1:12:51.140
 those power centers to serve the interests

1:12:51.140 --> 1:12:52.580
 of your own country.

1:12:52.580 --> 1:12:54.420
 And so that's why he's a multilateralist.

1:12:54.420 --> 1:12:55.940
 He's not a unilateralist.

1:12:55.940 --> 1:12:58.420
 He believes the United States should put itself

1:12:58.420 --> 1:13:00.060
 at the center of negotiations

1:13:00.060 --> 1:13:02.060
 between other powerful countries.

1:13:02.060 --> 1:13:03.900
 But that's also why he pays very little attention

1:13:03.900 --> 1:13:05.500
 to countries that are less powerful.

1:13:05.500 --> 1:13:07.220
 And this is why he's often criticized

1:13:07.220 --> 1:13:09.020
 by human rights activists.

1:13:09.020 --> 1:13:12.500
 For him, parts of Africa and Latin America,

1:13:12.500 --> 1:13:14.420
 which you and I would consider important places

1:13:14.420 --> 1:13:16.740
 are unimportant because they don't have power.

1:13:16.740 --> 1:13:17.900
 They can't project their power.

1:13:17.900 --> 1:13:20.540
 They don't produce a lot of economic wealth.

1:13:20.540 --> 1:13:21.620
 And so they matter less.

1:13:21.620 --> 1:13:25.260
 Realpolitik views the world in a hierarchy of power.

1:13:26.940 --> 1:13:31.940
 How does realpolitik realize itself in the world?

1:13:32.140 --> 1:13:34.980
 What does that really mean?

1:13:34.980 --> 1:13:37.100
 Like how do you push forward the interest

1:13:37.100 --> 1:13:37.980
 of your own country?

1:13:37.980 --> 1:13:40.060
 You said there's power centers,

1:13:40.060 --> 1:13:45.060
 but it is a big bold move to negotiate

1:13:45.420 --> 1:13:47.460
 to work with a communist nation,

1:13:47.460 --> 1:13:50.500
 with your enemies that are powerful.

1:13:50.500 --> 1:13:53.780
 What is the sort of, if you can further elaborate

1:13:53.780 --> 1:13:55.020
 the philosophy behind it.

1:13:55.020 --> 1:13:57.180
 Sure, so there are two key elements

1:13:57.180 --> 1:13:59.820
 that then end up producing all kinds of tactics.

1:13:59.820 --> 1:14:01.980
 But the two strategic elements of Kissinger's way

1:14:01.980 --> 1:14:03.340
 of thinking about realpolitik,

1:14:03.340 --> 1:14:04.580
 which are classical ways,

1:14:04.580 --> 1:14:07.100
 going back to Thucydides and the Greeks,

1:14:07.100 --> 1:14:08.700
 are to say, first of all,

1:14:08.700 --> 1:14:10.820
 you figure out who your allies are

1:14:10.820 --> 1:14:13.380
 and you build webs of connection

1:14:13.380 --> 1:14:16.300
 so that your allies help you to acquire

1:14:16.300 --> 1:14:18.340
 what you want to acquire.

1:14:18.340 --> 1:14:20.100
 This is why, according to Herodotus,

1:14:20.100 --> 1:14:21.260
 the Greeks beat the Persians.

1:14:21.260 --> 1:14:22.460
 The Persians are bigger,

1:14:22.460 --> 1:14:24.100
 but the Greeks, the Spartans, the Athenians,

1:14:24.100 --> 1:14:25.180
 others are able to work together

1:14:25.180 --> 1:14:27.260
 and leverage their resources.

1:14:27.260 --> 1:14:28.740
 So it's about leveraging your resources.

1:14:28.740 --> 1:14:31.100
 For Kissinger, this makes Western Europe

1:14:31.100 --> 1:14:32.420
 crucially important.

1:14:32.420 --> 1:14:35.060
 It makes Japan crucially important.

1:14:35.060 --> 1:14:38.300
 It makes Israel and Egypt crucially important

1:14:38.300 --> 1:14:39.460
 in building these webs.

1:14:39.460 --> 1:14:41.060
 You build your surrogates,

1:14:41.060 --> 1:14:43.100
 you build your brother states.

1:14:43.100 --> 1:14:44.220
 In other parts of the world,

1:14:44.220 --> 1:14:46.260
 you build tight connections and you work together

1:14:46.260 --> 1:14:49.060
 to control the resources that you want.

1:14:49.060 --> 1:14:50.900
 The second element of the strategy

1:14:50.900 --> 1:14:53.740
 is not to go to war with your adversary,

1:14:53.740 --> 1:14:56.060
 but to do all you can to limit the power

1:14:56.060 --> 1:14:57.420
 of your adversary.

1:14:57.420 --> 1:14:59.340
 Some of that is containment,

1:14:59.340 --> 1:15:01.500
 preventing the Soviet Union from expanding.

1:15:01.500 --> 1:15:04.260
 That was the key element of American Cold War policy.

1:15:04.260 --> 1:15:07.180
 But sometimes it's actually negotiation.

1:15:07.180 --> 1:15:09.020
 That's what detente was about for Kissinger.

1:15:09.020 --> 1:15:09.900
 He spends a lot of time,

1:15:09.900 --> 1:15:12.500
 more time than any other American foreign policymaker,

1:15:12.500 --> 1:15:14.500
 negotiating with Soviet leaders

1:15:14.500 --> 1:15:15.900
 as well as Chinese leaders.

1:15:15.900 --> 1:15:16.740
 What does he want to do?

1:15:16.740 --> 1:15:18.540
 He wants to limit the nuclear arms race.

1:15:18.540 --> 1:15:19.900
 The United States is ahead.

1:15:20.860 --> 1:15:22.780
 We don't want the Soviet Union to get ahead of us.

1:15:22.780 --> 1:15:26.100
 We negotiate to limit their abilities, right?

1:15:26.100 --> 1:15:28.140
 We play to our strengths.

1:15:28.140 --> 1:15:31.620
 So it's a combination of keeping your adversary down

1:15:31.620 --> 1:15:33.660
 and building tight webs.

1:15:33.660 --> 1:15:36.580
 Within that context, military force is used,

1:15:36.580 --> 1:15:39.100
 but you're not using war for the sake of war.

1:15:39.100 --> 1:15:43.300
 You're using warfare to further your access to the resources,

1:15:43.300 --> 1:15:46.420
 economic, political, geographic that you want.

1:15:46.420 --> 1:15:49.100
 To build relationships and then the second thing,

1:15:49.100 --> 1:15:51.020
 to limit the powers of those you're against.

1:15:51.020 --> 1:15:51.860
 Exactly.

1:15:51.860 --> 1:15:56.060
 So is there any sort of insights

1:15:56.060 --> 1:15:59.140
 into how he preferred to build relationships?

1:15:59.140 --> 1:16:03.060
 Are we talking about like, again, it's the one on one.

1:16:03.060 --> 1:16:05.140
 Is it through policy or is it through like,

1:16:05.140 --> 1:16:06.860
 phone conversations?

1:16:06.860 --> 1:16:09.820
 Is there any cool kind of insights that you could speak to?

1:16:09.820 --> 1:16:14.420
 Yeah, Kissinger is the ultimate kiss up.

1:16:14.420 --> 1:16:16.700
 He is, some used to make fun of him.

1:16:16.700 --> 1:16:20.900
 In fact, even the filmmaker from Dr. Strangelove,

1:16:20.900 --> 1:16:23.700
 whose name I'm forgetting, Stanley Kubrick,

1:16:23.700 --> 1:16:26.100
 called him kiss up at that time, right?

1:16:27.260 --> 1:16:30.220
 He had a wonderful way of figuring out

1:16:30.220 --> 1:16:33.580
 what it is you wanted, back to that discussion we had before

1:16:33.580 --> 1:16:35.620
 and trying to show how he could give you more

1:16:35.620 --> 1:16:36.780
 of what you wanted as a leader.

1:16:36.780 --> 1:16:40.460
 It was very personalistic, very personalistic.

1:16:40.460 --> 1:16:43.060
 And he spends a lot of time, for example,

1:16:43.060 --> 1:16:46.620
 kissing up to Leonid Brezhnev, kissing up to Mao.

1:16:46.620 --> 1:16:48.140
 He tells Mao, you're the greatest leader

1:16:48.140 --> 1:16:49.700
 in the history of the 20th century.

1:16:49.700 --> 1:16:52.540
 People will look back on you as the great leader.

1:16:52.540 --> 1:16:55.460
 Some of this sounds like BS, but it's serious, right?

1:16:55.460 --> 1:16:58.340
 He's feeding the egos of those around him.

1:16:58.340 --> 1:17:02.060
 Second, he is willing to get things done for you.

1:17:02.060 --> 1:17:03.020
 He's effective.

1:17:03.020 --> 1:17:05.500
 You want him around you because of his efficacy.

1:17:05.500 --> 1:17:07.740
 So Richard Nixon is always suspicious

1:17:07.740 --> 1:17:09.660
 that Henry Kissinger is getting more of the limelight.

1:17:09.660 --> 1:17:11.780
 He hates that Kissinger gets the Nobel Peace Prize

1:17:11.780 --> 1:17:13.940
 and he doesn't, but he needs him.

1:17:13.940 --> 1:17:16.420
 Because Kissinger's the guy who gets things done.

1:17:16.420 --> 1:17:17.620
 So he performs.

1:17:17.620 --> 1:17:19.540
 He builds a relationship in almost,

1:17:19.540 --> 1:17:21.340
 I say this in the book, in almost a gangster way.

1:17:21.340 --> 1:17:23.100
 He didn't like that he criticized that part of the book.

1:17:23.100 --> 1:17:25.460
 But again, I still think the evidence is there.

1:17:26.460 --> 1:17:28.860
 You need something to be done, boss, I'll do it.

1:17:29.780 --> 1:17:32.020
 And don't forget that I'm doing this for you.

1:17:32.020 --> 1:17:35.060
 And you get mutual dependency in a Hegelian way, right?

1:17:35.060 --> 1:17:39.980
 And so he builds this personal dependency

1:17:39.980 --> 1:17:42.460
 through ego and through performance.

1:17:42.460 --> 1:17:46.780
 And then he's so skillful at making decisions

1:17:46.780 --> 1:17:48.340
 for people who are more powerful

1:17:48.340 --> 1:17:49.780
 because he's never elected to office.

1:17:49.780 --> 1:17:53.060
 He always needs powerful people to let him do things.

1:17:53.060 --> 1:17:55.820
 But he convinces you it's your decision when it's really his.

1:17:55.820 --> 1:17:57.660
 To read his memos are beautiful.

1:17:57.660 --> 1:17:59.780
 He's actually very skilled at writing things

1:17:59.780 --> 1:18:02.420
 in a way that looks like he's giving you options

1:18:02.420 --> 1:18:05.420
 as president, but in fact, there's only one option there.

1:18:05.420 --> 1:18:10.420
 Is he, speaking to the gangster, to the loyalty,

1:18:10.740 --> 1:18:14.060
 is he ever, like the sense I got from Nixon

1:18:14.060 --> 1:18:18.100
 is he would, Nixon would backstab you if he needed to.

1:18:19.900 --> 1:18:24.140
 One of the things that I admire about gangsters

1:18:25.620 --> 1:18:28.820
 is they don't backstab those in their circle,

1:18:28.820 --> 1:18:30.700
 like loyalty above all else.

1:18:30.700 --> 1:18:33.260
 I mean, at least that's the sense I've gotten

1:18:33.260 --> 1:18:36.500
 from the stories of the past, at least.

1:18:36.500 --> 1:18:38.820
 Is, where would you put Kissinger on that?

1:18:38.820 --> 1:18:41.820
 Is he loyalty above all else?

1:18:41.820 --> 1:18:45.900
 Or is it, or a human, it's like the Steve Jobs thing,

1:18:45.900 --> 1:18:48.220
 is like, as long as you're useful, you're useful,

1:18:48.220 --> 1:18:52.420
 but then once, the moment you're no longer useful

1:18:52.420 --> 1:18:55.340
 is when you're knocked off the chessboard.

1:18:55.340 --> 1:18:56.380
 It's the latter with him.

1:18:56.380 --> 1:18:59.260
 He's backstabbing quite a lot.

1:18:59.260 --> 1:19:00.740
 And he's self serving.

1:19:00.740 --> 1:19:03.820
 But he also makes himself so useful

1:19:03.820 --> 1:19:05.740
 that even though Nixon knows he's doing that,

1:19:05.740 --> 1:19:07.300
 Nixon still needs him.

1:19:07.300 --> 1:19:08.140
 Yeah.

1:19:09.380 --> 1:19:13.420
 By the way, on that point, so having spoken with Kissinger,

1:19:13.420 --> 1:19:15.380
 what's your relationship like with him

1:19:15.380 --> 1:19:20.380
 as somebody who is in an objective way writing his story?

1:19:21.540 --> 1:19:22.620
 It was very difficult

1:19:22.620 --> 1:19:25.780
 because he's very good at manipulating people.

1:19:25.780 --> 1:19:28.900
 And we had about 12 or 13 interviews,

1:19:28.900 --> 1:19:31.340
 usually informal over lunch.

1:19:32.260 --> 1:19:34.980
 And this was many years ago.

1:19:34.980 --> 1:19:37.580
 This is probably now more than 10 years ago.

1:19:37.580 --> 1:19:41.420
 Did you find yourself being like sweet talked,

1:19:41.420 --> 1:19:43.940
 like to where you like go back home later

1:19:43.940 --> 1:19:44.900
 and look in the mirror and it's like,

1:19:44.900 --> 1:19:46.300
 wait, what just happened?

1:19:46.300 --> 1:19:48.980
 He can be enormously charming

1:19:48.980 --> 1:19:51.020
 and enormously obnoxious at the same time.

1:19:51.020 --> 1:19:53.380
 So I would have these very mixed emotions

1:19:53.380 --> 1:19:54.700
 because he gives no ground.

1:19:54.700 --> 1:19:58.580
 He's unwilling to, and I think this is a weakness,

1:19:58.580 --> 1:20:01.940
 he's unwilling to admit mistake.

1:20:03.580 --> 1:20:05.100
 Others make mistakes, but he doesn't.

1:20:05.100 --> 1:20:07.860
 And he certainly won't take on any of the big criticisms

1:20:07.860 --> 1:20:09.140
 that are pushed.

1:20:09.140 --> 1:20:09.980
 I understand why.

1:20:09.980 --> 1:20:11.740
 I mean, when you've worked as hard for what he has

1:20:11.740 --> 1:20:13.740
 as he has, you're defensive about it.

1:20:13.740 --> 1:20:15.580
 But he is very defensive and he's very fragile about it.

1:20:15.580 --> 1:20:17.620
 He does not like criticisms at all.

1:20:17.620 --> 1:20:19.820
 He used to, he hasn't done this in a while,

1:20:19.820 --> 1:20:22.420
 but he used to call me up and yell at me on the phone,

1:20:22.420 --> 1:20:24.620
 quite literally, when I would be quoted

1:20:24.620 --> 1:20:27.220
 in the New York Times or somewhere saying something

1:20:27.220 --> 1:20:28.740
 that sounded critical of him.

1:20:28.740 --> 1:20:30.420
 So for instance, there was one instance

1:20:30.420 --> 1:20:31.380
 a number of years ago,

1:20:31.380 --> 1:20:34.460
 where a reporter came across some documents

1:20:34.460 --> 1:20:37.740
 where Kissinger said negative things about Jews in Russia.

1:20:37.740 --> 1:20:39.460
 Typical things that a German Jew would say

1:20:39.460 --> 1:20:41.580
 about East European Jews.

1:20:41.580 --> 1:20:44.660
 And the New York Times asked me, is this accurate?

1:20:44.660 --> 1:20:46.860
 And I said, yeah, the documents are accurate.

1:20:46.860 --> 1:20:47.740
 I've seen them, they're accurate.

1:20:47.740 --> 1:20:49.820
 He was so angry about that.

1:20:49.820 --> 1:20:50.740
 So there's the fragility,

1:20:50.740 --> 1:20:52.060
 but there's also the enormous charm

1:20:52.060 --> 1:20:53.740
 and the enormous intelligence.

1:20:53.740 --> 1:20:54.860
 The real challenge with him though,

1:20:54.860 --> 1:20:56.940
 is he's very good at making his case.

1:20:56.940 --> 1:20:57.860
 He'll convince you.

1:20:58.780 --> 1:21:02.220
 And as a scholar, as an observer,

1:21:02.220 --> 1:21:03.660
 you don't wanna hear a lawyer's case.

1:21:03.660 --> 1:21:05.580
 You wanna actually interrogate the evidence

1:21:05.580 --> 1:21:07.060
 and get to the truth.

1:21:07.060 --> 1:21:09.340
 And so that was a real challenge with him.

1:21:09.340 --> 1:21:13.180
 So speaking of his approach of realpolitik,

1:21:14.220 --> 1:21:17.020
 if we just zoom out and look at a human history,

1:21:17.020 --> 1:21:20.660
 human civilization, what do you think works best

1:21:20.660 --> 1:21:25.580
 in the way we progress forward?

1:21:25.580 --> 1:21:28.700
 A realistic approach, do whatever it takes,

1:21:28.700 --> 1:21:30.500
 control the centers of power,

1:21:30.500 --> 1:21:34.100
 to play a game for the greater interests

1:21:34.100 --> 1:21:36.420
 of the good guys, quote unquote.

1:21:36.420 --> 1:21:40.100
 Or lead by sort of idealism,

1:21:40.100 --> 1:21:45.100
 which is like truly act in the best version

1:21:46.860 --> 1:21:48.660
 of the ideas you represent,

1:21:48.660 --> 1:21:52.180
 as opposed to kind of present one view

1:21:52.180 --> 1:21:55.460
 and then do whatever it takes behind the scenes.

1:21:55.460 --> 1:21:56.620
 Obviously you need some of both,

1:21:56.620 --> 1:21:58.340
 but I lean more to the idealistic side

1:21:58.340 --> 1:22:00.540
 and more so actually, believe it or not,

1:22:00.540 --> 1:22:04.380
 as I get into my 40s, as I do more historical work.

1:22:04.380 --> 1:22:05.220
 Why do I say that?

1:22:05.220 --> 1:22:07.500
 Because I think, and this is one of my criticisms

1:22:07.500 --> 1:22:10.020
 of Kissinger, who I also have a lot of respect for,

1:22:10.020 --> 1:22:12.140
 the realpolitik becomes self defeating

1:22:13.100 --> 1:22:15.380
 because you're constantly running to keep power,

1:22:15.380 --> 1:22:17.140
 but you forget why.

1:22:17.140 --> 1:22:18.740
 And you often then use power,

1:22:18.740 --> 1:22:20.340
 and I think Kissinger falls into this

1:22:20.340 --> 1:22:22.620
 in some of his worst moments, not all of his moments,

1:22:22.620 --> 1:22:23.860
 where the power is actually being used

1:22:23.860 --> 1:22:25.580
 to undermine the things you care about.

1:22:25.580 --> 1:22:27.300
 It's sort of the example of being a parent

1:22:27.300 --> 1:22:28.980
 and you're doing all these things

1:22:28.980 --> 1:22:32.260
 to take your kid to violin, basketball, all these things,

1:22:32.260 --> 1:22:33.860
 and you realize you're actually killing your kid

1:22:33.860 --> 1:22:35.580
 and making your kid very unhappy.

1:22:35.580 --> 1:22:36.780
 And the whole reason you were doing it

1:22:36.780 --> 1:22:39.140
 was to improve the person's life.

1:22:39.140 --> 1:22:41.380
 And so you have to remember why it is,

1:22:41.380 --> 1:22:43.940
 what Hans Morgenthau calls this is your purpose.

1:22:43.940 --> 1:22:45.780
 Your purpose has to drive you.

1:22:45.780 --> 1:22:49.180
 Now your purpose doesn't have to be airy, fiery idealism.

1:22:49.180 --> 1:22:52.300
 So I believe deeply in democracy is an ideal.

1:22:52.300 --> 1:22:56.700
 I don't think it's gonna ever look like Athenian democracy,

1:22:56.700 --> 1:23:00.220
 but that should drive our policy.

1:23:00.220 --> 1:23:01.460
 But we still have to be realistic

1:23:01.460 --> 1:23:03.460
 and recognize we're not gonna build that democracy

1:23:03.460 --> 1:23:04.780
 in Afghanistan tomorrow.

1:23:06.020 --> 1:23:07.940
 I mean, does it ultimately just boil down again

1:23:07.940 --> 1:23:09.580
 to the corrupting nature of power

1:23:09.580 --> 1:23:14.580
 that nobody can hold power for very long

1:23:16.260 --> 1:23:21.260
 before you start acting in the interest of power

1:23:21.260 --> 1:23:23.940
 as opposed to in the interest of your ideals?

1:23:23.940 --> 1:23:27.420
 It's impossible to be like somebody like Kissinger

1:23:27.420 --> 1:23:32.420
 who is essentially in power for many, many decades

1:23:32.420 --> 1:23:37.260
 and still remember what are the initial ideals

1:23:37.260 --> 1:23:41.340
 that you strove to achieve.

1:23:42.540 --> 1:23:44.380
 Yes, I think that's exactly right.

1:23:44.380 --> 1:23:48.300
 There's a moment in the book I quote about him,

1:23:48.300 --> 1:23:49.380
 comes from one of our interviews.

1:23:49.380 --> 1:23:54.060
 I asked him, what were the guiding ideals for your policies?

1:23:54.060 --> 1:23:57.300
 And he said, I'm not prepared to share that.

1:23:57.300 --> 1:23:58.900
 And I don't think it's because he doesn't know

1:23:58.900 --> 1:24:00.500
 what he thinks he was trying to do.

1:24:00.500 --> 1:24:04.620
 He realizes his use of power departed quite a lot from.

1:24:04.620 --> 1:24:08.100
 So it would sound, if he made them explicit,

1:24:08.100 --> 1:24:09.460
 it would sound hypocritical.

1:24:09.460 --> 1:24:10.300
 Correct.

1:24:12.020 --> 1:24:15.180
 Well, on that, let me ask about war.

1:24:15.180 --> 1:24:20.140
 America often presents itself to its own people,

1:24:20.140 --> 1:24:22.660
 but just the leaders, when they look in the mirror,

1:24:22.660 --> 1:24:26.560
 I get a sense that we think of ourselves as the good guys.

1:24:29.780 --> 1:24:34.780
 And especially this begins sometimes to look hypocritical

1:24:34.980 --> 1:24:36.260
 when you're waging war.

1:24:38.260 --> 1:24:43.260
 Is there a good way to know when you've lost all sense

1:24:43.260 --> 1:24:46.300
 of what it is to be good?

1:24:48.580 --> 1:24:52.620
 Another way to ask that, is there in military policy

1:24:52.620 --> 1:24:55.820
 in conducting war, is there a good way to know

1:24:55.820 --> 1:24:59.980
 what is a just war and what is a war crime?

1:24:59.980 --> 1:25:03.820
 I mean, in some circles, Kissinger is accused

1:25:03.820 --> 1:25:07.360
 of contributing, being a war criminal.

1:25:07.360 --> 1:25:10.080
 Yes, and I argue in the book, he's not a war criminal,

1:25:10.080 --> 1:25:15.080
 but that doesn't mean that he didn't misuse military power.

1:25:15.140 --> 1:25:20.020
 I think a just war, a just war,

1:25:20.020 --> 1:25:21.780
 as Michael Walzer and others write about it,

1:25:21.780 --> 1:25:26.020
 a just war is a war where both the purpose is just,

1:25:26.020 --> 1:25:29.780
 and you are using the means to get to that purpose

1:25:29.780 --> 1:25:33.400
 that kill as few people as necessary.

1:25:33.400 --> 1:25:35.180
 That doesn't mean they won't be killing,

1:25:35.180 --> 1:25:36.020
 but as few as necessary.

1:25:36.020 --> 1:25:37.300
 Proportionality, right?

1:25:37.300 --> 1:25:40.580
 Your means should be proportional to your ends.

1:25:40.580 --> 1:25:43.500
 And that's often lost sight of,

1:25:43.500 --> 1:25:48.500
 because the drive to get to the end often self justifies

1:25:48.620 --> 1:25:50.100
 means that go well beyond that.

1:25:50.100 --> 1:25:55.100
 And so that's how we get into torture in the war on terror.

1:25:55.620 --> 1:25:57.980
 Is there some kind of lesson for the future

1:25:57.980 --> 1:26:00.160
 that you can take away from that?

1:26:00.160 --> 1:26:03.940
 Yes, I think the first set of lessons that I've shared

1:26:03.940 --> 1:26:06.820
 as a historian with military decision makers is,

1:26:06.820 --> 1:26:08.580
 first of all, always remember why you're there,

1:26:08.580 --> 1:26:10.460
 what your purpose is, and always ask yourself

1:26:10.460 --> 1:26:13.620
 if the means you're using are actually proportional.

1:26:13.620 --> 1:26:15.140
 Ask that question.

1:26:15.140 --> 1:26:17.300
 Just because you have these means that you can use,

1:26:17.300 --> 1:26:19.340
 just because you have these tools,

1:26:19.340 --> 1:26:22.180
 doesn't mean they're the right tools to use.

1:26:22.180 --> 1:26:25.180
 And here's the question that follows from that.

1:26:25.180 --> 1:26:26.780
 And it's a hard question to ask,

1:26:26.780 --> 1:26:29.380
 because the answer is one we often don't like to hear.

1:26:29.380 --> 1:26:33.140
 Are the things I'm doing in war actually doing more harm

1:26:33.140 --> 1:26:36.900
 or more good to the reason I went into war?

1:26:36.900 --> 1:26:39.020
 We came to a point in the war on terror

1:26:39.020 --> 1:26:40.100
 where what we were doing was actually

1:26:40.100 --> 1:26:41.300
 creating more terrorists.

1:26:42.900 --> 1:26:44.500
 And that's when you have to stop.

1:26:46.140 --> 1:26:47.460
 Well, some of that is in the data,

1:26:47.460 --> 1:26:49.460
 but some of it, there's a leap of faith.

1:26:49.460 --> 1:26:51.140
 So from a parenting perspective,

1:26:51.140 --> 1:26:54.700
 let me speak as a person with no kids and a single guy,

1:26:55.700 --> 1:26:58.100
 let me be the expert in the room on parenting.

1:26:58.100 --> 1:27:03.100
 Now, it does seem that it's a very difficult thing to do,

1:27:05.900 --> 1:27:10.900
 even though you know that your kid was making a mistake,

1:27:10.980 --> 1:27:12.180
 to let them make a mistake,

1:27:12.180 --> 1:27:15.500
 to give them the freedom to make the mistake.

1:27:15.500 --> 1:27:16.580
 I don't know what to do,

1:27:16.580 --> 1:27:19.620
 but I mean, that's a very kind of lighthearted way

1:27:19.620 --> 1:27:21.540
 of phrasing the following,

1:27:21.540 --> 1:27:26.460
 which is when you look at some of the places in the world,

1:27:26.460 --> 1:27:30.660
 like Afghanistan, which is not doing well.

1:27:32.300 --> 1:27:34.900
 To move out knowing that there's going to be

1:27:34.900 --> 1:27:38.980
 a lot of suffering, economic suffering, injustices,

1:27:40.100 --> 1:27:42.540
 terrorist organizations growing,

1:27:42.540 --> 1:27:44.860
 that's committing crimes on its own people

1:27:44.860 --> 1:27:48.660
 and potentially committing crimes against allies,

1:27:48.660 --> 1:27:52.180
 violence against allies, violence against the United States.

1:27:52.180 --> 1:27:57.180
 So how do you know what to do in that case?

1:27:58.260 --> 1:28:01.420
 Well, again, it's an art, not a science,

1:28:01.420 --> 1:28:04.660
 which is what makes it hard for an engineer to think about.

1:28:04.660 --> 1:28:07.180
 This is what makes it endlessly fascinating for me.

1:28:07.180 --> 1:28:08.700
 And I think the real intellectual work

1:28:08.700 --> 1:28:10.740
 is at the level of the art, right?

1:28:10.740 --> 1:28:13.060
 And I think probably engineering at its highest level

1:28:13.060 --> 1:28:14.980
 becomes an art as well, right?

1:28:14.980 --> 1:28:17.660
 So policymaking, you never know.

1:28:17.660 --> 1:28:18.900
 But I will say this,

1:28:18.900 --> 1:28:21.020
 I'll say you have to ask yourself and look in the mirror

1:28:21.020 --> 1:28:23.460
 and say, is all the effort I'm putting in

1:28:23.460 --> 1:28:25.500
 actually making this better?

1:28:25.500 --> 1:28:28.420
 And in Afghanistan, you look at the 20 years

1:28:28.420 --> 1:28:32.740
 and two plus trillion dollars that the US has put in.

1:28:32.740 --> 1:28:34.900
 And the fact that, as you said correctly,

1:28:34.900 --> 1:28:36.020
 it's not doing well right now

1:28:36.020 --> 1:28:37.660
 after 20 years of that investment.

1:28:38.980 --> 1:28:41.780
 I might like a company that I invest in,

1:28:41.780 --> 1:28:44.580
 but after 20 years of my throwing money in that company,

1:28:45.460 --> 1:28:46.300
 it's time to get out.

1:28:46.300 --> 1:28:51.300
 Well, in some sense, getting out now, that's kind of obvious.

1:28:51.540 --> 1:28:54.340
 I'm more interested in how we figure out in the future

1:28:54.340 --> 1:28:57.740
 how to get out earlier than, I mean, at this point,

1:28:57.740 --> 1:28:59.340
 we stayed too long and it's obvious,

1:28:59.340 --> 1:29:02.820
 the data, the investment, nothing is working.

1:29:04.380 --> 1:29:07.580
 The very little data points to us staying there.

1:29:07.580 --> 1:29:11.620
 I'm more interested in being in a relation,

1:29:11.620 --> 1:29:13.740
 let me take it back to a safer place again,

1:29:13.740 --> 1:29:14.740
 being in a relationship

1:29:14.740 --> 1:29:16.300
 and getting out of that relationship

1:29:16.300 --> 1:29:17.420
 while things are still good,

1:29:17.420 --> 1:29:19.300
 but you have a sense that it's not going to end up

1:29:19.300 --> 1:29:20.380
 in a good place.

1:29:20.380 --> 1:29:22.300
 That's the difficult thing.

1:29:22.300 --> 1:29:24.660
 You have to ask yourself, whether it's a relationship

1:29:24.660 --> 1:29:26.300
 or you're talking about policymaking

1:29:26.300 --> 1:29:28.220
 in a place like Afghanistan,

1:29:28.220 --> 1:29:31.540
 are the things I'm doing showing me evidence,

1:29:31.540 --> 1:29:34.220
 real evidence that they're making things better

1:29:34.220 --> 1:29:35.620
 or making things worse?

1:29:35.620 --> 1:29:37.460
 That's a hard question to answer.

1:29:37.460 --> 1:29:38.540
 You have to be very honest.

1:29:38.540 --> 1:29:40.780
 And in a policymaking context,

1:29:40.780 --> 1:29:41.860
 we have to actually do the same thing

1:29:41.860 --> 1:29:43.260
 we do in a relationship context.

1:29:43.260 --> 1:29:44.300
 What do we do in a relationship context?

1:29:44.300 --> 1:29:46.500
 We ask other friends who are observing.

1:29:46.500 --> 1:29:48.060
 We ask for other observers.

1:29:48.060 --> 1:29:50.700
 This is actually just a scientific method element actually

1:29:50.700 --> 1:29:52.540
 that we can't, the Heisenberg principle,

1:29:52.540 --> 1:29:54.540
 I can't see it because I'm too close to it.

1:29:54.540 --> 1:29:57.140
 I'm changing it by my looking at it.

1:29:57.140 --> 1:30:00.500
 I need others to tell me in a policymaking context,

1:30:00.500 --> 1:30:02.660
 this is why you need to hear from other people,

1:30:02.660 --> 1:30:03.900
 not just the generals,

1:30:03.900 --> 1:30:05.860
 because here's the thing about the generals.

1:30:05.860 --> 1:30:09.540
 They generally are patriotic, hardworking people,

1:30:09.540 --> 1:30:11.460
 but they're too close.

1:30:11.460 --> 1:30:12.300
 They're not lying.

1:30:12.300 --> 1:30:13.140
 They're too close.

1:30:13.140 --> 1:30:14.420
 I just think they can do better.

1:30:14.420 --> 1:30:15.260
 Yeah.

1:30:17.180 --> 1:30:20.580
 How do you think about the Cold War now

1:30:20.580 --> 1:30:21.940
 from the beginning to end,

1:30:21.940 --> 1:30:26.020
 and maybe also with an eye towards

1:30:26.020 --> 1:30:30.340
 the current potential cyber conflict,

1:30:30.340 --> 1:30:32.860
 cyber war with China and with Russia,

1:30:32.860 --> 1:30:35.580
 if we look sort of other kind of Cold Wars

1:30:35.580 --> 1:30:38.820
 potentially emerging in the 21st century,

1:30:38.820 --> 1:30:43.300
 when you look back at the Cold War of the 20th century,

1:30:43.300 --> 1:30:46.620
 how do you see it and what lessons do we draw from it?

1:30:46.620 --> 1:30:48.340
 It's a wonderful question

1:30:48.340 --> 1:30:50.260
 because I teach this to undergraduates

1:30:50.260 --> 1:30:54.220
 and it's really interesting to see how undergraduates now,

1:30:54.220 --> 1:30:56.620
 almost all of whom were born after 9 11.

1:30:56.620 --> 1:30:57.580
 Yeah.

1:30:57.580 --> 1:30:59.780
 So the Cold War is ancient history to them.

1:30:59.780 --> 1:31:04.700
 In fact, the Cold War to them is as far removed

1:31:04.700 --> 1:31:07.260
 as the 1950s were to me.

1:31:07.260 --> 1:31:10.700
 I mean, it's unbelievable.

1:31:10.700 --> 1:31:13.420
 It's almost like World War II for my generation

1:31:13.420 --> 1:31:14.940
 and Cold War for them.

1:31:14.940 --> 1:31:15.780
 It's so far removed.

1:31:15.780 --> 1:31:16.820
 The collapse of the Soviet Union

1:31:16.820 --> 1:31:18.340
 doesn't mean anything to them.

1:31:20.220 --> 1:31:23.340
 So how do you describe the Cold War to them?

1:31:23.340 --> 1:31:25.500
 How do you describe the Soviet Union to them?

1:31:25.500 --> 1:31:27.700
 First of all, I have to explain to them

1:31:27.700 --> 1:31:29.700
 why people were so fearful of communism.

1:31:30.700 --> 1:31:33.260
 Anti communism is very hard for them to understand.

1:31:33.260 --> 1:31:36.460
 The fact that in the 1950s,

1:31:36.460 --> 1:31:39.060
 Americans believed that communists

1:31:39.060 --> 1:31:40.660
 were going to infiltrate our society

1:31:40.660 --> 1:31:41.820
 and many other societies.

1:31:41.820 --> 1:31:46.380
 And that after Fidel Castro comes to power in 1959,

1:31:46.380 --> 1:31:47.900
 that we're going to see communist regimes

1:31:47.900 --> 1:31:49.740
 all across Latin America,

1:31:49.740 --> 1:31:52.500
 that fear of communism married to nuclear power.

1:31:53.620 --> 1:31:56.380
 And then even the fear that maybe economically

1:31:56.380 --> 1:31:58.260
 they would outpace us because they would create

1:31:58.260 --> 1:32:02.820
 this sort of army of Khrushchevian builders of things

1:32:02.820 --> 1:32:04.300
 and what does Khrushchev said, right?

1:32:04.300 --> 1:32:06.580
 Say we're gonna catch Britain in five years

1:32:06.580 --> 1:32:08.620
 and then the United States after that, right?

1:32:08.620 --> 1:32:11.540
 So to explain that sense of fear to them

1:32:11.540 --> 1:32:14.300
 that they don't have of those others,

1:32:14.300 --> 1:32:15.900
 that's really important.

1:32:15.900 --> 1:32:19.860
 The Cold War was fundamentally about the United States

1:32:19.860 --> 1:32:22.060
 defending a capitalist world order

1:32:22.060 --> 1:32:24.940
 against a serious challenger from communism.

1:32:24.940 --> 1:32:27.780
 An alternative way of organizing everything,

1:32:27.780 --> 1:32:30.660
 private property, economic activity,

1:32:30.660 --> 1:32:32.780
 enterprise, life, everything,

1:32:32.780 --> 1:32:34.300
 organized in a totally different way.

1:32:34.300 --> 1:32:36.940
 It was a struggle between two systems.

1:32:36.940 --> 1:32:38.580
 So your sense is, and sorry to interrupt,

1:32:38.580 --> 1:32:41.820
 but your sense is that the conflict of the Cold War

1:32:41.820 --> 1:32:43.780
 was between two ideologies

1:32:44.780 --> 1:32:48.460
 and not just two big countries with nuclear weapons.

1:32:48.460 --> 1:32:49.980
 I think it was about two different ways of life

1:32:49.980 --> 1:32:52.620
 or two different promoted ways of life.

1:32:52.620 --> 1:32:56.380
 The Soviet Union never actually lived communism.

1:32:56.380 --> 1:32:58.780
 But I think my reading of Stalin

1:32:58.780 --> 1:33:00.380
 is he really tried to go there.

1:33:00.380 --> 1:33:02.620
 Khrushchev really believed Gorbachev

1:33:02.620 --> 1:33:04.460
 thought he was going to reform the Soviet Union

1:33:04.460 --> 1:33:07.020
 so you would go back to a kind of Bukhar and Lenin

1:33:07.020 --> 1:33:08.260
 communism, right?

1:33:08.260 --> 1:33:10.380
 So I do think that mattered.

1:33:10.380 --> 1:33:11.660
 I do think that mattered enormously.

1:33:11.660 --> 1:33:13.860
 And for the United States point of view,

1:33:13.860 --> 1:33:16.820
 the view was that communism and fascism

1:33:16.820 --> 1:33:18.860
 were these totalitarian threats

1:33:18.860 --> 1:33:21.340
 to liberal democracy and capitalism,

1:33:21.340 --> 1:33:22.700
 which went hand in hand.

1:33:22.700 --> 1:33:24.540
 So I do think that's what the struggle was about.

1:33:24.540 --> 1:33:26.580
 And in a certain way, liberal capitalism

1:33:26.580 --> 1:33:28.340
 proved to be the more enduring system

1:33:28.340 --> 1:33:30.980
 and the United States played a key role in that.

1:33:30.980 --> 1:33:33.580
 That's the reality of the Cold War.

1:33:33.580 --> 1:33:35.220
 But I think it means different things now

1:33:35.220 --> 1:33:38.140
 to my students and others.

1:33:38.140 --> 1:33:43.140
 They focus very much on the expansion of American power

1:33:43.980 --> 1:33:46.060
 and the challenges of managing.

1:33:47.180 --> 1:33:49.340
 They're looking at it from the perspective

1:33:49.340 --> 1:33:51.980
 of not will we survive,

1:33:51.980 --> 1:33:54.820
 but did we waste our resources on some elements of it?

1:33:54.820 --> 1:33:57.540
 It doesn't mean they were against what America did,

1:33:57.540 --> 1:33:59.260
 but there is a question of the resources

1:33:59.260 --> 1:34:02.580
 that went into the Cold War and the opportunity costs.

1:34:02.580 --> 1:34:04.860
 And you see this when you look at the sort of

1:34:04.860 --> 1:34:06.740
 healthcare systems that other countries build

1:34:06.740 --> 1:34:10.780
 and you compare them to the United States, race issues also.

1:34:10.780 --> 1:34:12.220
 So they look at the costs,

1:34:12.220 --> 1:34:14.900
 which I think often happens after a project is done,

1:34:14.900 --> 1:34:16.420
 you look back at that.

1:34:16.420 --> 1:34:19.900
 Second, I think they're also more inclined

1:34:19.900 --> 1:34:23.460
 to see the world as less bipolar,

1:34:23.460 --> 1:34:26.700
 to see the role of China as more complicated.

1:34:26.700 --> 1:34:29.900
 Post colonial or anti colonial movements,

1:34:29.900 --> 1:34:32.220
 independent states in Africa and Latin America,

1:34:32.220 --> 1:34:34.140
 that gets more attention.

1:34:34.140 --> 1:34:39.140
 So one of the criticisms now is because you forget

1:34:39.260 --> 1:34:42.220
 the lessons of 20th century history

1:34:42.220 --> 1:34:45.380
 and the atrocities committed under communism,

1:34:45.380 --> 1:34:48.500
 that you may be a little bit more willing

1:34:48.500 --> 1:34:52.260
 to accept some of those ideologies

1:34:52.260 --> 1:34:54.700
 into our United States society.

1:34:54.700 --> 1:34:59.700
 That this kind of, that forgetting that capitalistic forces

1:35:00.100 --> 1:35:05.100
 are part of the reason why we have what we have today.

1:35:05.940 --> 1:35:10.940
 There's a fear amongst some now that we would have,

1:35:11.780 --> 1:35:14.980
 what would allow basically communism

1:35:14.980 --> 1:35:17.700
 to take hold in America.

1:35:17.700 --> 1:35:20.740
 I mean, Jordan and others speak to this kind of idea.

1:35:20.740 --> 1:35:23.860
 I tend to not be so fearful of it.

1:35:23.860 --> 1:35:27.780
 I think it's on the surface, it's not deep within.

1:35:27.780 --> 1:35:30.460
 I do see the world as very complicated

1:35:30.460 --> 1:35:34.340
 as there needing to be a role of having support

1:35:34.340 --> 1:35:36.500
 for each other on certain political levels,

1:35:36.500 --> 1:35:40.140
 economic levels, and then also supporting entrepreneurs.

1:35:40.140 --> 1:35:45.140
 It's like that the kind of enforcing of outcomes

1:35:45.460 --> 1:35:47.780
 that is fundamental to the communist system

1:35:47.780 --> 1:35:50.100
 is not something we're actually close to.

1:35:50.100 --> 1:35:52.020
 And some of that is just fear mongering

1:35:52.020 --> 1:35:56.300
 for likes on Twitter kind of thing.

1:35:56.300 --> 1:35:57.340
 If I could come in on that,

1:35:57.340 --> 1:35:58.660
 because I agree with you 100%.

1:35:58.660 --> 1:36:00.940
 I've spent a lot of time writing and looking at this

1:36:00.940 --> 1:36:02.980
 and talking to people about this.

1:36:02.980 --> 1:36:04.980
 There's no communism in the United States.

1:36:04.980 --> 1:36:07.380
 There never has been, and there certainly isn't now.

1:36:07.380 --> 1:36:09.980
 And I'll say this both from an academic point of view,

1:36:09.980 --> 1:36:11.500
 but also from just spending a lot of time

1:36:11.500 --> 1:36:13.380
 observing young people in the United States.

1:36:13.380 --> 1:36:14.900
 Even those on the farthest left,

1:36:14.900 --> 1:36:16.940
 take whoever you think is the farthest left,

1:36:16.940 --> 1:36:18.660
 they don't even understand what communism is.

1:36:18.660 --> 1:36:20.620
 They're not communist in any sense.

1:36:20.620 --> 1:36:22.420
 Americans are raised in a vernacular

1:36:22.420 --> 1:36:24.900
 and environment of private property ownership.

1:36:24.900 --> 1:36:26.660
 And as you know better than anyone,

1:36:26.660 --> 1:36:27.780
 if you believe in private property,

1:36:27.780 --> 1:36:28.820
 you don't believe in communism.

1:36:28.820 --> 1:36:33.820
 So the sort of Bernie Sanders kind of socialist elements,

1:36:34.700 --> 1:36:36.660
 that's very different, right?

1:36:36.660 --> 1:36:39.140
 And I would say some of that, not all of that,

1:36:39.140 --> 1:36:40.540
 some of that does hearken back

1:36:40.540 --> 1:36:42.780
 to actually what won in the Cold War.

1:36:42.780 --> 1:36:45.020
 There were many social democratic elements

1:36:45.020 --> 1:36:46.220
 of what the United States did

1:36:46.220 --> 1:36:48.020
 that led to our winning the Cold War.

1:36:48.020 --> 1:36:53.020
 For example, the New Deal was investing government money

1:36:53.580 --> 1:36:57.220
 in propping up business, in propping up labor unions.

1:36:57.220 --> 1:37:00.180
 And during the Cold War, we spent more money

1:37:00.180 --> 1:37:03.660
 than we had ever spent in our history on infrastructure,

1:37:03.660 --> 1:37:08.660
 on schools, on providing social support, social security,

1:37:08.700 --> 1:37:11.780
 our national pension system being one of them.

1:37:11.780 --> 1:37:15.260
 So you could argue actually that social democracy

1:37:15.260 --> 1:37:17.740
 is very compatible with capitalism.

1:37:17.740 --> 1:37:19.500
 And I think that's the debate we're having today,

1:37:19.500 --> 1:37:20.620
 how much social democracy.

1:37:20.620 --> 1:37:22.940
 I'll also say that the capitalism we've experienced

1:37:22.940 --> 1:37:24.700
 the last 20 years is different

1:37:24.700 --> 1:37:26.900
 from the capitalism of the Cold War.

1:37:26.900 --> 1:37:28.980
 During the Cold War, there was the presumption

1:37:28.980 --> 1:37:33.980
 in the United States that you had to pay taxes

1:37:35.420 --> 1:37:38.180
 to support our Cold War activities,

1:37:38.180 --> 1:37:40.340
 that it was okay to make money,

1:37:40.340 --> 1:37:43.740
 but the more money you made, the more taxes you had to pay.

1:37:43.740 --> 1:37:45.500
 We had the highest marginal tax rates

1:37:45.500 --> 1:37:47.860
 in our history during the Cold War.

1:37:47.860 --> 1:37:50.620
 Now, the aversion to taxes,

1:37:50.620 --> 1:37:52.260
 and of course, no one ever likes paying taxes,

1:37:52.260 --> 1:37:55.060
 but the notion that we can do things on deficit spending,

1:37:55.060 --> 1:37:58.020
 that's a post Cold War phenomenon.

1:37:58.020 --> 1:37:59.540
 That's not a Cold War phenomenon.

1:37:59.540 --> 1:38:02.300
 So, so much of the capitalism that we're talking about today

1:38:02.300 --> 1:38:03.780
 is not the capitalism of the Cold War.

1:38:03.780 --> 1:38:05.660
 And maybe, again, we can learn that

1:38:05.660 --> 1:38:09.900
 and see how we can reform capitalism today

1:38:09.900 --> 1:38:13.500
 and get rid of this false worry

1:38:13.500 --> 1:38:14.900
 about communism in the United States.

1:38:14.900 --> 1:38:15.740
 Yeah, you know what?

1:38:15.740 --> 1:38:17.380
 You make me actually realize something important.

1:38:17.380 --> 1:38:20.060
 What we have to remember is the words we use

1:38:20.060 --> 1:38:21.860
 on the surface about different policies,

1:38:21.860 --> 1:38:23.900
 what you think is right and wrong,

1:38:23.900 --> 1:38:28.300
 is actually different than the core thing

1:38:28.300 --> 1:38:32.820
 that is in your blood, the core ideas that are there.

1:38:33.740 --> 1:38:36.420
 I do see the United States as this,

1:38:36.420 --> 1:38:41.260
 there's this fire that burns of individual freedoms,

1:38:41.260 --> 1:38:46.260
 of property rights, these basic foundational ideas

1:38:48.380 --> 1:38:50.820
 that everybody just kind of takes for granted.

1:38:50.820 --> 1:38:53.220
 And I think if you hold on to them,

1:38:54.220 --> 1:38:57.060
 if you're like raised in them,

1:38:57.060 --> 1:39:00.740
 talking about ideas of social security,

1:39:00.740 --> 1:39:05.740
 of universal basic income, of reallocation of resources

1:39:05.740 --> 1:39:08.380
 is a fundamentally different kind of discussion

1:39:08.380 --> 1:39:10.700
 than you had in the Soviet Union.

1:39:10.700 --> 1:39:13.420
 I think the value of the individual

1:39:13.420 --> 1:39:16.460
 is so core to the American system

1:39:16.460 --> 1:39:21.300
 that you basically cannot possibly do the kind of atrocities

1:39:21.300 --> 1:39:25.100
 that you saw in the Soviet Union.

1:39:25.100 --> 1:39:26.860
 But, of course, you never know,

1:39:26.860 --> 1:39:30.620
 the slippery slope has a way of changing things.

1:39:30.620 --> 1:39:33.100
 But I do believe the things you're born with

1:39:33.100 --> 1:39:34.940
 is just so core to this country.

1:39:34.940 --> 1:39:38.420
 It's part of the, I don't know what your thoughts are.

1:39:38.420 --> 1:39:42.180
 We are in Texas, I'm not necessarily,

1:39:42.180 --> 1:39:43.420
 I don't necessarily wanna have

1:39:43.420 --> 1:39:45.340
 a gun control type of conversation,

1:39:45.340 --> 1:39:48.580
 but the reason I really like guns,

1:39:50.380 --> 1:39:53.980
 it doesn't make any sense, but philosophically,

1:39:53.980 --> 1:39:58.620
 it's such a declaration of individual rights

1:39:58.620 --> 1:40:01.780
 that's so different than the conversations I hear

1:40:01.780 --> 1:40:04.460
 with my Russian family and my Russian friends,

1:40:04.460 --> 1:40:06.420
 that the gun, it's very possible

1:40:06.420 --> 1:40:08.660
 that having guns is bad for society

1:40:08.660 --> 1:40:11.580
 in the sense that it will lead to more violence.

1:40:11.580 --> 1:40:13.900
 But there's something about this discussion

1:40:20.260 --> 1:40:24.660
 that proclaims the value of my freedom as an individual.

1:40:24.660 --> 1:40:26.300
 I'm not being eloquent in it,

1:40:26.300 --> 1:40:28.740
 but there's very few debates

1:40:28.740 --> 1:40:30.340
 where whenever people are saying,

1:40:30.340 --> 1:40:32.300
 should you have what level of gun control,

1:40:32.300 --> 1:40:34.380
 all those kinds of things,

1:40:34.380 --> 1:40:39.380
 what I hear is it's a fight for how much freedom,

1:40:40.500 --> 1:40:44.180
 even if it's stupid freedom, should the individual have.

1:40:44.180 --> 1:40:46.620
 I think that's what's articulated quite often.

1:40:46.620 --> 1:40:49.980
 I think combining your two points, which are great points,

1:40:49.980 --> 1:40:52.700
 I think there is something about American individualism

1:40:52.700 --> 1:40:56.620
 which is deeply ingrained in our culture and our society.

1:40:56.620 --> 1:40:58.860
 And it means that the kinds of bad things

1:40:58.860 --> 1:41:01.460
 that happen are different, usually not as bad.

1:41:01.460 --> 1:41:04.300
 But our individualism often covers up

1:41:04.300 --> 1:41:08.900
 for vigilante activity and individual violence

1:41:08.900 --> 1:41:10.100
 toward people that you wouldn't have

1:41:10.100 --> 1:41:11.980
 in a more collective culture.

1:41:11.980 --> 1:41:14.060
 So in the Soviet Union, it was at a much worse scale

1:41:14.060 --> 1:41:17.220
 and it was done by government organizations.

1:41:17.220 --> 1:41:19.340
 In the United States, it's individuals,

1:41:19.340 --> 1:41:22.020
 the history of lynching in our country, for example.

1:41:22.020 --> 1:41:23.980
 Sometimes it's individual police officers,

1:41:23.980 --> 1:41:24.980
 sometimes it's others.

1:41:24.980 --> 1:41:27.300
 Again, the vast majority of police officers are good people

1:41:27.300 --> 1:41:30.260
 and don't do harm to people, but there are these examples

1:41:30.260 --> 1:41:33.740
 and they are able to fester in our society

1:41:33.740 --> 1:41:34.780
 because of our individualism.

1:41:34.780 --> 1:41:37.940
 Now, gun ownership is about personal freedom,

1:41:37.940 --> 1:41:39.620
 I think, for a lot of people.

1:41:39.620 --> 1:41:42.780
 And there's no doubt that in our history,

1:41:42.780 --> 1:41:44.420
 included in the Second Amendment,

1:41:44.420 --> 1:41:46.300
 which can be interpreted in different ways,

1:41:46.300 --> 1:41:48.260
 is the presumption that people should have the right

1:41:48.260 --> 1:41:49.220
 to defend themselves,

1:41:49.220 --> 1:41:51.020
 which is what I think you're getting at here.

1:41:51.020 --> 1:41:53.300
 That you should not be completely dependent

1:41:53.300 --> 1:41:55.780
 for your defense on an entity

1:41:55.780 --> 1:41:56.860
 that might not be there for you.

1:41:56.860 --> 1:41:59.500
 You should be able to defend yourself.

1:41:59.500 --> 1:42:01.620
 And guns symbolize that.

1:42:01.620 --> 1:42:03.620
 I think that's a fair point.

1:42:03.620 --> 1:42:06.100
 But I think it's also a fair point to say

1:42:06.100 --> 1:42:08.140
 that as with everything,

1:42:08.140 --> 1:42:10.700
 defining what self defense is, is really important.

1:42:10.700 --> 1:42:13.540
 So does self defense mean I can have a bazooka?

1:42:13.540 --> 1:42:16.020
 Does it mean I can have weapons that are designed

1:42:16.020 --> 1:42:19.020
 for a military battlefield to mass kill people?

1:42:19.020 --> 1:42:21.340
 That seems to me to be very different

1:42:21.340 --> 1:42:23.060
 from saying I should have a handgun

1:42:23.060 --> 1:42:26.340
 or some small arm to defend myself.

1:42:26.340 --> 1:42:28.620
 That distinction alone would make a huge difference.

1:42:28.620 --> 1:42:31.820
 Most of the mass shootings, at least,

1:42:31.820 --> 1:42:34.500
 which are a smaller proportion of the larger gun deaths

1:42:34.500 --> 1:42:35.540
 in the United States, which are larger

1:42:35.540 --> 1:42:37.780
 than any other society, but at least the mass shootings

1:42:37.780 --> 1:42:39.100
 are usually perpetrated by people

1:42:39.100 --> 1:42:41.260
 who have not self defense weapons,

1:42:41.260 --> 1:42:43.460
 but mass killing, mass killing weapons.

1:42:43.460 --> 1:42:45.660
 And I think there's an important distinction there.

1:42:45.660 --> 1:42:47.460
 The Constitution talks about a right to bear arms

1:42:47.460 --> 1:42:49.100
 for a well regulated militia.

1:42:49.100 --> 1:42:51.300
 When the framers talked about arms,

1:42:51.300 --> 1:42:53.180
 that did not mean the ability to kill

1:42:53.180 --> 1:42:55.140
 as many people as you wanna kill.

1:42:55.140 --> 1:42:56.500
 It meant the ability to defend yourself.

1:42:56.500 --> 1:42:57.740
 So let's have that conversation.

1:42:57.740 --> 1:42:59.500
 I think it would be useful as a society.

1:42:59.500 --> 1:43:02.060
 Stop talking about guns or no guns.

1:43:02.060 --> 1:43:04.180
 What is it that we as citizens need

1:43:04.180 --> 1:43:05.740
 to feel we can defend ourselves?

1:43:05.740 --> 1:43:06.740
 Yes.

1:43:06.740 --> 1:43:09.180
 Yeah, I mean, guns have this complicated issue

1:43:09.180 --> 1:43:11.060
 that it can cause harm to others.

1:43:11.060 --> 1:43:15.140
 I tend to see sort of maybe like legalization of drugs.

1:43:16.100 --> 1:43:19.100
 I tend to believe that we should have the freedom

1:43:19.100 --> 1:43:20.620
 to do stupid things.

1:43:20.620 --> 1:43:23.420
 Yeah, so long as we're not harming lots of other people.

1:43:23.420 --> 1:43:25.740
 Yes, and then guns, of course, have the property

1:43:25.740 --> 1:43:26.900
 that they can be used.

1:43:26.900 --> 1:43:30.660
 It's not just a bazooka I would argue is pretty stupid

1:43:30.660 --> 1:43:32.820
 to own for your own self defense,

1:43:32.820 --> 1:43:35.380
 but it has the very negative side effect

1:43:35.380 --> 1:43:38.540
 of being potentially used to harm other people.

1:43:38.540 --> 1:43:42.420
 And you have to consider that kind of stuff.

1:43:42.420 --> 1:43:45.180
 By the way, as a side note to the listeners,

1:43:45.180 --> 1:43:47.180
 there's been a bunch of people saying

1:43:47.180 --> 1:43:50.980
 that Lex is way too libertarian for my taste.

1:43:50.980 --> 1:43:54.900
 No, I actually am just struggling with ideas

1:43:54.900 --> 1:43:57.380
 and sometimes put on different hats in these conversations.

1:43:57.380 --> 1:43:59.620
 I think through different ideas,

1:43:59.620 --> 1:44:02.080
 whether they're left, right or libertarian.

1:44:02.080 --> 1:44:03.300
 That's true for gun control.

1:44:03.300 --> 1:44:04.500
 That's true for immigration.

1:44:04.500 --> 1:44:05.980
 That's true for all of that.

1:44:05.980 --> 1:44:10.220
 I think we should have discussions in the space of ideas

1:44:10.220 --> 1:44:13.020
 versus in the space of bins we put each other in labels

1:44:13.020 --> 1:44:13.860
 and we put each other in.

1:44:13.860 --> 1:44:15.100
 I agree 100%.

1:44:15.100 --> 1:44:17.460
 And also change our minds all the time.

1:44:18.700 --> 1:44:23.220
 Try out, say stupid stuff with the best of intention,

1:44:23.220 --> 1:44:25.460
 trying our best to think through it.

1:44:25.460 --> 1:44:29.020
 And then after saying it, think about it for a few days

1:44:29.020 --> 1:44:31.420
 and then change your mind and grow in this way.

1:44:32.780 --> 1:44:35.020
 Let me ask a ridiculous question.

1:44:35.020 --> 1:44:38.220
 When you zoom out, when human civilization

1:44:38.220 --> 1:44:41.560
 has destroyed itself and alien graduate students

1:44:41.560 --> 1:44:46.460
 are studying it like three, four, five centuries from now,

1:44:46.460 --> 1:44:47.720
 what do you think we'll remember

1:44:47.720 --> 1:44:50.520
 about this period in history?

1:44:50.520 --> 1:44:55.300
 The 20th century, the 21st century, this time.

1:44:55.300 --> 1:44:57.900
 We had a couple of wars.

1:44:57.900 --> 1:45:02.140
 We had a charismatic black president in the United States.

1:45:02.140 --> 1:45:06.020
 We had a couple of pandemics.

1:45:06.020 --> 1:45:11.020
 What do you think will actually stand out in history?

1:45:11.100 --> 1:45:15.740
 No doubt the rapid technological innovation

1:45:15.740 --> 1:45:18.220
 of the last 20 to 30 years.

1:45:18.220 --> 1:45:21.820
 How we created a whole virtual universe

1:45:21.820 --> 1:45:23.260
 we didn't have before.

1:45:23.260 --> 1:45:25.060
 And of course that's gonna go in directions

1:45:25.060 --> 1:45:27.460
 you and I can't imagine 50 years from now.

1:45:27.460 --> 1:45:29.360
 But this will be seen as that origin moment

1:45:29.360 --> 1:45:31.920
 that when we went from playing below the rim

1:45:31.920 --> 1:45:33.260
 to playing above the rim, right?

1:45:33.260 --> 1:45:37.140
 To be all in person to having a whole virtual world.

1:45:37.140 --> 1:45:41.060
 And in a strange way, the pandemic was a provocation

1:45:41.060 --> 1:45:43.240
 to move even further in that direction.

1:45:43.240 --> 1:45:44.940
 And we're never going back, right?

1:45:44.940 --> 1:45:46.780
 We're gonna restore some of the things we were doing

1:45:46.780 --> 1:45:48.580
 before the pandemic, but we're never gonna go back

1:45:48.580 --> 1:45:50.580
 to that world we were in before where every meeting

1:45:50.580 --> 1:45:53.280
 you had to fly to that place to be in the room

1:45:53.280 --> 1:45:54.620
 with the people.

1:45:54.620 --> 1:45:57.060
 So this whole virtual world and the virtual personas

1:45:57.060 --> 1:46:00.020
 and the avatars and all of that,

1:46:00.020 --> 1:46:02.600
 I think that's going to be a big part

1:46:02.600 --> 1:46:03.880
 of how people remember our time.

1:46:03.880 --> 1:46:06.820
 Also the sort of biotechnology element of it,

1:46:06.820 --> 1:46:10.080
 which the vaccines are part of.

1:46:10.080 --> 1:46:12.740
 It's amazing how quickly, this is the great triumph,

1:46:12.740 --> 1:46:15.940
 how quickly we've produced and distributed these vaccines.

1:46:15.940 --> 1:46:18.020
 And of course there are problems with who's taking them,

1:46:18.020 --> 1:46:22.180
 but the reality is, I mean, this is light speed

1:46:22.180 --> 1:46:23.780
 compared to what it would have been like,

1:46:23.780 --> 1:46:26.580
 not just in 1918, in 1980.

1:46:26.580 --> 1:46:28.940
 Yeah, one of the, I'm sorry if I'm interrupting,

1:46:28.940 --> 1:46:30.760
 but one of the disappointing things

1:46:30.760 --> 1:46:33.660
 about this particular time is because vaccines,

1:46:33.660 --> 1:46:37.400
 like a lot of things got politicized,

1:46:37.400 --> 1:46:40.700
 used as little pawns in the game of politics,

1:46:40.700 --> 1:46:44.420
 that we don't get the chance to step back fully at least

1:46:44.420 --> 1:46:49.220
 and celebrate the brilliance of the human species.

1:46:49.220 --> 1:46:50.060
 That's right.

1:46:51.780 --> 1:46:55.780
 Yes, there are scientists who use their authority

1:46:55.780 --> 1:46:59.840
 improperly, that have an ego,

1:46:59.840 --> 1:47:04.840
 that when they're within institutions,

1:47:05.220 --> 1:47:06.900
 are dishonest with the public

1:47:06.900 --> 1:47:09.340
 because they don't trust the intelligence of the public,

1:47:09.340 --> 1:47:11.320
 they are not authentic and transparent,

1:47:11.320 --> 1:47:13.080
 all the same things you could say about humans

1:47:13.080 --> 1:47:15.420
 in any positions of power, anywhere.

1:47:15.420 --> 1:47:18.980
 Okay, that doesn't mean science isn't incredible

1:47:18.980 --> 1:47:23.520
 and the vaccines, I mean, I don't often talk about it

1:47:23.520 --> 1:47:27.800
 because it's so political and it's heartbreaking to,

1:47:28.660 --> 1:47:31.180
 it's heartbreaking how all the good stuff

1:47:31.180 --> 1:47:32.540
 is getting politicized.

1:47:32.540 --> 1:47:34.240
 Yeah, that's right, and it shouldn't be,

1:47:34.240 --> 1:47:36.580
 and it'll seem less political.

1:47:36.580 --> 1:47:37.780
 Eating the long arc of history.

1:47:37.780 --> 1:47:42.600
 Yep, it'll be seen as an outstanding accomplishment.

1:47:42.600 --> 1:47:44.740
 And as a step toward whatever,

1:47:44.740 --> 1:47:46.180
 maybe they're doing vaccines

1:47:46.180 --> 1:47:48.620
 or something that replaces the vaccine in 10 seconds,

1:47:48.620 --> 1:47:49.700
 at that point, right?

1:47:49.700 --> 1:47:50.700
 It'll be seen as a step.

1:47:50.700 --> 1:47:52.240
 Those will be some of the positives.

1:47:52.240 --> 1:47:54.100
 I think one of the negatives they will point to

1:47:54.100 --> 1:47:58.420
 will be our inability, at least at this moment,

1:47:58.420 --> 1:48:00.460
 to manage our environment better,

1:48:00.460 --> 1:48:02.740
 how we're destroying our living space

1:48:02.740 --> 1:48:05.100
 and not doing enough even though we have the capabilities

1:48:05.100 --> 1:48:06.260
 to do more to preserve

1:48:06.260 --> 1:48:09.300
 or at least allow a sustainable living space.

1:48:09.300 --> 1:48:11.740
 I'm confident because I'm an optimist

1:48:11.740 --> 1:48:12.780
 that we will get through this

1:48:12.780 --> 1:48:15.300
 and we will be better at sustaining our environment

1:48:15.300 --> 1:48:16.700
 in future decades.

1:48:16.700 --> 1:48:18.820
 And so in terms of environmental policy,

1:48:18.820 --> 1:48:21.540
 they'll see this moment as a dark age

1:48:21.540 --> 1:48:24.760
 or the beginnings of a better age, maybe as a renaissance.

1:48:26.180 --> 1:48:31.180
 Or maybe as the last time most people lived on Earth

1:48:31.340 --> 1:48:33.300
 when a couple of centuries afterwards

1:48:33.300 --> 1:48:36.300
 we were all dissipated throughout the solar system

1:48:36.300 --> 1:48:37.260
 and the galaxy.

1:48:37.260 --> 1:48:38.100
 Very possible.

1:48:38.100 --> 1:48:41.120
 If the local resident, hometown resident,

1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:43.640
 Mr. Elon Musk has anything to do with it.

1:48:45.300 --> 1:48:49.140
 I do tend to think you're absolutely right.

1:48:49.140 --> 1:48:51.020
 With all this political bickering,

1:48:51.020 --> 1:48:55.020
 we shouldn't forget that what this age will be remembered by

1:48:55.020 --> 1:48:57.360
 is the incredible levels of innovation.

1:48:57.360 --> 1:49:02.360
 I do think the biotech stuff worries me more than anything

1:49:02.480 --> 1:49:04.640
 because it feels like there's a lot of weapons

1:49:04.640 --> 1:49:06.780
 that could be yet to be developed in that space.

1:49:06.780 --> 1:49:09.860
 But I tend to believe that,

1:49:09.860 --> 1:49:11.720
 I'm excited by two avenues.

1:49:11.720 --> 1:49:13.420
 One is artificial intelligence.

1:49:16.900 --> 1:49:19.660
 The kind of systems we'll create in this digital space

1:49:19.660 --> 1:49:21.260
 that you mentioned we're moving to.

1:49:21.260 --> 1:49:23.140
 And then the other, of course,

1:49:23.140 --> 1:49:24.820
 this could be the product of the Cold War,

1:49:24.820 --> 1:49:27.620
 but I'm super excited by space exploration.

1:49:27.620 --> 1:49:30.380
 There's a magic to humans being.

1:49:30.380 --> 1:49:31.320
 And we're getting back to it.

1:49:31.320 --> 1:49:34.380
 I mean, we were enthralled with it in the 50s and 60s

1:49:34.380 --> 1:49:35.780
 when it was a Cold War competition.

1:49:35.780 --> 1:49:38.260
 And then after the 70s, we sort of gave up on it.

1:49:38.260 --> 1:49:40.100
 And thanks to Elon Musk and others,

1:49:40.100 --> 1:49:41.700
 we're coming back to this issue.

1:49:41.700 --> 1:49:44.860
 And I think there's so much to be gained

1:49:44.860 --> 1:49:46.440
 from the power of exploration.

1:49:47.580 --> 1:49:50.060
 Is there books or movies in your life,

1:49:50.060 --> 1:49:53.060
 long ago or recently, that had a big impact on you?

1:49:53.060 --> 1:49:53.900
 Yes.

1:49:53.900 --> 1:49:54.720
 Is there something you would?

1:49:54.720 --> 1:49:55.560
 Yes.

1:49:56.740 --> 1:49:58.740
 My favorite novel, I always tell people this,

1:49:58.740 --> 1:49:59.660
 I love reading novels.

1:49:59.660 --> 1:50:01.120
 I'm a historian.

1:50:01.120 --> 1:50:03.900
 And I think the historian and the novelist are actually,

1:50:03.900 --> 1:50:06.240
 and the technology innovator are all actually

1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:07.080
 one and the same.

1:50:07.080 --> 1:50:08.860
 They're all storytellers.

1:50:08.860 --> 1:50:11.460
 And we're all in the imagination space.

1:50:11.460 --> 1:50:14.460
 And I'm trying to imagine the world of the past

1:50:14.460 --> 1:50:16.760
 to inform us in the present for the future.

1:50:16.760 --> 1:50:18.780
 So one of my favorite novels that I read,

1:50:18.780 --> 1:50:20.220
 actually when I was in graduate school,

1:50:20.220 --> 1:50:23.040
 is Thomas Mann's Buddenbrooks.

1:50:23.040 --> 1:50:26.220
 And it's the story of a family in Lübeck

1:50:26.220 --> 1:50:29.180
 in Northern Germany, living through the 19th century

1:50:29.180 --> 1:50:31.780
 and the rise and fall of family, cycles of life.

1:50:31.780 --> 1:50:34.420
 Many things we've talked about in the last couple of hours.

1:50:34.420 --> 1:50:38.740
 Cycles of life, challenges of adjusting

1:50:38.740 --> 1:50:39.680
 to the world around you.

1:50:39.680 --> 1:50:42.420
 And it's just a very moving reflection

1:50:42.420 --> 1:50:44.300
 on the limits of human agency

1:50:44.300 --> 1:50:47.500
 and how we all have to understand the circumstances

1:50:47.500 --> 1:50:49.140
 we're in and adjust to them.

1:50:49.140 --> 1:50:51.660
 And there's triumph and tragedy in that.

1:50:51.660 --> 1:50:52.600
 It's a wonderful novel.

1:50:52.600 --> 1:50:54.260
 It used to be a kind of canonical work.

1:50:54.260 --> 1:50:55.580
 It's sort of fallen out now.

1:50:55.580 --> 1:50:59.240
 It's a big, big novel, but I'm very moved by that.

1:50:59.240 --> 1:51:01.020
 I'm very moved by Tall Stories, War and Peace.

1:51:01.020 --> 1:51:03.020
 I assign that every year to my students.

1:51:03.020 --> 1:51:04.740
 That's a big, big book.

1:51:04.740 --> 1:51:07.300
 But what Tall Story challenges

1:51:07.300 --> 1:51:08.940
 is he challenges the notion

1:51:08.940 --> 1:51:11.100
 that a Napoleon can rule the world.

1:51:11.100 --> 1:51:12.720
 And we're all little Napoleons, right?

1:51:12.720 --> 1:51:15.180
 We're all sort of thinking that we're gonna do that.

1:51:15.180 --> 1:51:18.180
 And he reminds us how much is contingency, circumstance.

1:51:18.180 --> 1:51:21.000
 It doesn't mean we don't have some control.

1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:23.640
 You've spoke to me a little bit of Russian.

1:51:23.640 --> 1:51:24.740
 Where does that come from?

1:51:24.740 --> 1:51:26.940
 So your appreciation of Tall Story,

1:51:26.940 --> 1:51:28.840
 but also your ability to speak a bit of Russian.

1:51:28.840 --> 1:51:30.040
 Where's that from?

1:51:30.040 --> 1:51:32.020
 So I speak, in addition to English,

1:51:32.020 --> 1:51:34.500
 I speak reasonably well,

1:51:34.500 --> 1:51:36.820
 depending on how much vodka I've had.

1:51:36.820 --> 1:51:39.420
 Russian, I speak French and German.

1:51:39.420 --> 1:51:42.960
 I learned those for research purposes.

1:51:42.960 --> 1:51:44.620
 I learned French actually when I was in high school,

1:51:44.620 --> 1:51:45.900
 Russian when I was in college,

1:51:45.900 --> 1:51:47.760
 German when I was in graduate school.

1:51:47.760 --> 1:51:49.860
 Now I do have family on my mother's side

1:51:49.860 --> 1:51:51.660
 that's of Russian Jewish extraction,

1:51:52.660 --> 1:51:55.220
 but they were Yiddish speakers by the time I met them.

1:51:55.220 --> 1:51:56.700
 By the time they had gone through Germany

1:51:56.700 --> 1:51:57.580
 and come to the United States,

1:51:57.580 --> 1:51:59.140
 or really gone through Poland and come to the United States,

1:51:59.140 --> 1:52:00.020
 they were Yiddish speakers.

1:52:00.020 --> 1:52:02.500
 So there's no one really in my family who speaks Russian,

1:52:02.500 --> 1:52:04.060
 but I do feel a connection there,

1:52:04.060 --> 1:52:07.280
 at least a long range personal connection.

1:52:07.280 --> 1:52:09.660
 Is there something to be said about the language

1:52:09.660 --> 1:52:12.780
 and your ability to imagine history?

1:52:12.780 --> 1:52:17.160
 Sort of when you study these different countries,

1:52:17.160 --> 1:52:19.440
 your ability to imagine what it was like

1:52:19.440 --> 1:52:24.440
 to be a part of that culture, part of that time?

1:52:24.640 --> 1:52:27.580
 Yes, language is crucial to understanding a culture.

1:52:27.580 --> 1:52:30.620
 And even if you learn the languages I have,

1:52:30.620 --> 1:52:32.440
 learning Russian and German and French,

1:52:32.440 --> 1:52:33.280
 it's still not the same

1:52:33.280 --> 1:52:36.340
 as also being a native speaker either, as you know.

1:52:36.340 --> 1:52:39.420
 But I think language tells you a lot about mannerism,

1:52:39.420 --> 1:52:40.600
 about assumptions.

1:52:41.940 --> 1:52:46.780
 The very fact that English doesn't have a formal U,

1:52:46.780 --> 1:52:48.380
 but Russian has a formal U, right?

1:52:48.380 --> 1:52:49.820
 V versus T, right?

1:52:49.820 --> 1:52:53.160
 German has a formal U, Z versus D, right?

1:52:53.160 --> 1:52:56.380
 So the fact that English doesn't have a formal U

1:52:56.380 --> 1:52:59.140
 tells you something about Americans, right?

1:52:59.140 --> 1:53:01.020
 And that's just one example.

1:53:01.020 --> 1:53:06.020
 The fact that Germans have such a wider vocabulary

1:53:07.300 --> 1:53:10.500
 for certain scientific concepts than we have in English

1:53:10.500 --> 1:53:12.100
 tells you something about the culture, right?

1:53:12.100 --> 1:53:14.980
 Language is an artifact of the culture.

1:53:14.980 --> 1:53:16.340
 The culture makes the language.

1:53:16.340 --> 1:53:17.420
 It's fascinating to explore.

1:53:17.420 --> 1:53:19.720
 I mean, even just exactly what you just said,

1:53:19.720 --> 1:53:24.720
 V, T, which is, there's a fascinating transition.

1:53:26.680 --> 1:53:28.720
 So I guess in English we just have U.

1:53:28.720 --> 1:53:33.720
 There's a fascinating transition that persists to this day

1:53:34.760 --> 1:53:38.040
 is of formalism and politeness,

1:53:38.040 --> 1:53:41.520
 where it's an initial kind of dance of interaction

1:53:41.520 --> 1:53:46.520
 that's different methods of signaling respect, I guess.

1:53:46.520 --> 1:53:48.520
 We don't, and language provides that,

1:53:48.520 --> 1:53:51.360
 and then in the English language,

1:53:51.360 --> 1:53:53.640
 there's fewer tools to show that kind of respect,

1:53:53.640 --> 1:53:56.200
 which has potentially positive or negative effects

1:53:56.200 --> 1:53:59.040
 on, it flattens the society where like a teenager

1:53:59.040 --> 1:54:04.040
 could talk to an older person and show like a deference.

1:54:04.280 --> 1:54:06.920
 I mean, but at the same time,

1:54:06.920 --> 1:54:09.240
 I mean, it creates a certain kind of dynamic,

1:54:09.240 --> 1:54:10.920
 a certain kind of society.

1:54:10.920 --> 1:54:13.560
 And it's funny to think of just like those few words

1:54:13.560 --> 1:54:16.800
 can have like a ripple effect through the whole culture.

1:54:16.800 --> 1:54:18.760
 And we don't have a history in the United States

1:54:18.760 --> 1:54:20.600
 of aristocracy.

1:54:20.600 --> 1:54:23.920
 These elements of language reflect aristocracy.

1:54:23.920 --> 1:54:26.440
 The serf would never refer to the master,

1:54:26.440 --> 1:54:27.960
 even if the master is younger,

1:54:27.960 --> 1:54:29.600
 it's always Voi, right?

1:54:29.600 --> 1:54:30.920
 In Turgenev, it's always Voi, right?

1:54:30.920 --> 1:54:33.640
 I mean, and so it's, yeah,

1:54:33.640 --> 1:54:34.960
 so it tells you something about the history.

1:54:34.960 --> 1:54:37.160
 That's why to your question, which was a great question,

1:54:37.160 --> 1:54:40.080
 it's so crucial to try to penetrate the language.

1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:41.600
 I'll also say something else,

1:54:41.600 --> 1:54:43.400
 and this is a problem for many Americans

1:54:43.400 --> 1:54:44.440
 who haven't learned a foreign language.

1:54:44.440 --> 1:54:46.480
 We're very bad at teaching foreign languages.

1:54:46.480 --> 1:54:49.920
 If you've never taught yourself a foreign language,

1:54:49.920 --> 1:54:53.200
 you have closed yourself off to certain kinds of empathy

1:54:53.200 --> 1:54:55.640
 because you have basically trained your brain

1:54:55.640 --> 1:54:57.840
 to only look at the world one way.

1:54:57.840 --> 1:55:00.440
 The very act of learning another language,

1:55:00.440 --> 1:55:05.040
 I think tells your brain that words and concepts

1:55:05.040 --> 1:55:06.440
 don't translate one to one.

1:55:06.440 --> 1:55:07.520
 This is the first thing you realize, right?

1:55:07.520 --> 1:55:10.160
 We can say, you know, these two words mean this thing,

1:55:10.160 --> 1:55:12.000
 you know, these two words mean the same thing

1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:15.200
 from two languages, they never mean exactly the same thing.

1:55:15.200 --> 1:55:18.320
 Dosvidanya is really not goodbye, right?

1:55:19.240 --> 1:55:20.760
 And there's something, you know,

1:55:20.760 --> 1:55:22.360
 right now there's people talking about

1:55:22.360 --> 1:55:24.520
 idea of lived experience.

1:55:24.520 --> 1:55:27.800
 One of the ways to force yourself into this idea

1:55:27.800 --> 1:55:30.280
 of lived experience is by learning another language,

1:55:30.280 --> 1:55:32.320
 to understand that you can perceive the world

1:55:32.320 --> 1:55:33.360
 in a totally different way,

1:55:33.360 --> 1:55:35.920
 even though you're perceiving the same thing.

1:55:35.920 --> 1:55:38.400
 And of course, the way to first learn Russian

1:55:38.400 --> 1:55:41.120
 for those looking for tutorial lessons for me

1:55:41.120 --> 1:55:44.680
 is just like as you said, we start by drinking lots of vodka.

1:55:44.680 --> 1:55:45.520
 Yes, of course.

1:55:45.520 --> 1:55:48.040
 It's very difficult to do otherwise.

1:55:48.040 --> 1:55:51.640
 Is there advice you have for young people about career,

1:55:51.640 --> 1:55:56.640
 about life, in making their way in the world?

1:55:56.920 --> 1:56:00.440
 Yes, two things I believe that I say

1:56:00.440 --> 1:56:02.200
 to a lot of talented young people.

1:56:02.200 --> 1:56:05.880
 First, I don't think you can predict

1:56:05.880 --> 1:56:08.880
 what is gonna be well renumerated 20 years from now.

1:56:08.880 --> 1:56:11.160
 Don't pick a profession because you think,

1:56:11.160 --> 1:56:13.080
 even though your parents might tell you or something,

1:56:13.080 --> 1:56:14.200
 do this and you'll make money.

1:56:14.200 --> 1:56:16.240
 You know, this is the scene in The Graduate

1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:17.760
 where a guy tells Dustin Hoffman,

1:56:17.760 --> 1:56:20.360
 go into plastics, money in plastics.

1:56:20.360 --> 1:56:21.200
 We don't know.

1:56:21.200 --> 1:56:22.480
 So many of my students now have parents

1:56:22.480 --> 1:56:25.360
 who are telling them, bright students, you know,

1:56:25.360 --> 1:56:26.560
 go to the business school.

1:56:26.560 --> 1:56:29.360
 That's what's gonna set you up to make money.

1:56:29.360 --> 1:56:31.080
 If you're passionate about business, yes.

1:56:31.080 --> 1:56:33.560
 But don't begin by thinking you know

1:56:33.560 --> 1:56:35.480
 what's gonna be hot 20 years from now.

1:56:35.480 --> 1:56:38.080
 You don't know what's gonna be hot from 20 years ago,

1:56:38.080 --> 1:56:38.920
 20 years from now.

1:56:38.920 --> 1:56:39.760
 What should you do?

1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:40.840
 This is advice number one.

1:56:40.840 --> 1:56:43.000
 Find what you're passionate about.

1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:45.160
 Because if you're passionate about it,

1:56:45.160 --> 1:56:47.640
 you will do good work in that area if you're talented

1:56:47.640 --> 1:56:50.280
 and usually passion and talent overlap.

1:56:50.280 --> 1:56:52.800
 And you'll find a way to get people to pay you for it.

1:56:52.800 --> 1:56:54.880
 I mean, you do it really well, people will wanna pay.

1:56:54.880 --> 1:56:56.200
 That's where capitalism works.

1:56:56.200 --> 1:56:57.920
 People will find it valuable, right?

1:56:57.920 --> 1:57:00.000
 Whether it's violin playing, right?

1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:02.320
 Or engineering or poetry, you will find,

1:57:02.320 --> 1:57:03.920
 you might not become a billionaire.

1:57:03.920 --> 1:57:05.160
 That involves other things.

1:57:05.160 --> 1:57:07.400
 But you'll find a way to get people to pay you for it.

1:57:07.400 --> 1:57:11.960
 And then the second thing is it's really important

1:57:11.960 --> 1:57:13.440
 at the very beginning of your career,

1:57:13.440 --> 1:57:16.520
 even before you're in your job, right?

1:57:16.520 --> 1:57:18.320
 To start building your networks.

1:57:18.320 --> 1:57:22.120
 But networks are not just people you're on Facebook with

1:57:22.120 --> 1:57:24.640
 or Twitter with, I mean, that's fine.

1:57:24.640 --> 1:57:26.720
 It's actually forming relationships.

1:57:26.720 --> 1:57:28.720
 And some of that can be mediated in the digital world,

1:57:28.720 --> 1:57:30.360
 but I mean real relationships.

1:57:30.360 --> 1:57:31.880
 I like podcasts because I think

1:57:31.880 --> 1:57:33.720
 they actually open up that space.

1:57:33.720 --> 1:57:36.280
 I know a lot of people can listen to a podcast

1:57:36.280 --> 1:57:38.760
 and find someone else who's listened to that podcast

1:57:38.760 --> 1:57:40.440
 and have a conversation about a topic.

1:57:40.440 --> 1:57:42.200
 It opens up that space.

1:57:42.200 --> 1:57:43.800
 Build those relationships,

1:57:43.800 --> 1:57:45.840
 not with people who you think will be powerful,

1:57:45.840 --> 1:57:48.320
 but people you think are interesting

1:57:48.320 --> 1:57:50.480
 because they'll do interesting things.

1:57:50.480 --> 1:57:54.840
 And every successful person I know at some level

1:57:54.840 --> 1:57:57.440
 had a key moment where they got where they are

1:57:57.440 --> 1:58:00.120
 because of someone they knew for some other reason

1:58:00.120 --> 1:58:01.160
 who had that connection.

1:58:01.160 --> 1:58:03.760
 So use and spread your networks

1:58:03.760 --> 1:58:05.200
 and make them as diverse as possible.

1:58:05.200 --> 1:58:08.080
 Find people who are of a different party,

1:58:08.080 --> 1:58:10.680
 have different interests, but are interesting to you.

1:58:11.800 --> 1:58:12.640
 That's brilliant advice.

1:58:12.640 --> 1:58:15.160
 And some of that on the passion side,

1:58:15.160 --> 1:58:19.840
 I do find that as somebody who has a lot of passions,

1:58:21.320 --> 1:58:26.320
 I find the second part to that is committing.

1:58:27.080 --> 1:58:28.560
 Yes, that's true too.

1:58:28.560 --> 1:58:32.000
 Which sucks because life is finite.

1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:34.200
 And when you commit, you say,

1:58:34.200 --> 1:58:37.960
 well, I'm never going to be good.

1:58:37.960 --> 1:58:40.400
 Like when you choose one of the two passions,

1:58:40.400 --> 1:58:42.400
 one of the two things you're interested in,

1:58:42.400 --> 1:58:45.320
 you're basically saying, I'm letting go.

1:58:45.320 --> 1:58:47.560
 I'm saying goodbye to.

1:58:47.560 --> 1:58:48.400
 That's true.

1:58:48.400 --> 1:58:49.240
 That's true.

1:58:49.240 --> 1:58:50.160
 Which is actually what does goodbye means,

1:58:50.160 --> 1:58:51.320
 not goodbye, but letting go.

1:58:51.320 --> 1:58:52.520
 That's exactly right.

1:58:52.520 --> 1:58:53.640
 I think that's exactly right.

1:58:53.640 --> 1:58:55.480
 I think you do have to make choices.

1:58:55.480 --> 1:58:56.800
 You do have to set priorities.

1:58:56.800 --> 1:58:58.560
 I often laugh at students who tell me

1:58:58.560 --> 1:59:00.560
 they want to have like three majors.

1:59:00.560 --> 1:59:02.120
 If you have three majors, you have no major, right?

1:59:02.120 --> 1:59:04.680
 I mean, so I do think you have to make choices.

1:59:04.680 --> 1:59:09.680
 I also think it's important that whatever you do,

1:59:09.920 --> 1:59:11.840
 even if it's a small thing,

1:59:11.840 --> 1:59:13.760
 you always do the best you can.

1:59:13.760 --> 1:59:15.520
 You always do excellent work.

1:59:15.520 --> 1:59:17.440
 My kids are tired of hearing me say this at home,

1:59:17.440 --> 1:59:21.200
 but I believe everything you do should be about excellence.

1:59:21.200 --> 1:59:22.600
 The best you can do.

1:59:22.600 --> 1:59:23.560
 If I'm going to wash the dishes,

1:59:23.560 --> 1:59:26.120
 I'm going to be the best person washing the dishes.

1:59:26.120 --> 1:59:28.000
 If I'm going to write a book review,

1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:30.120
 I'm going to write the best possible book review I can.

1:59:30.120 --> 1:59:30.960
 Why?

1:59:30.960 --> 1:59:33.920
 Because you develop a culture about yourself,

1:59:33.920 --> 1:59:35.480
 which is about excellence.

1:59:35.480 --> 1:59:39.040
 Yeah, I was telling you offline about all the kind of stuff,

1:59:39.040 --> 1:59:41.420
 Google Fiber and cable installation, all that stuff.

1:59:41.420 --> 1:59:45.480
 I've been always a believer, washing dishes.

1:59:45.480 --> 1:59:47.840
 People don't often believe me when I say this.

1:59:47.840 --> 1:59:49.560
 I don't care what I do.

1:59:50.800 --> 1:59:52.560
 I am with David Foster Wallace.

1:59:52.560 --> 1:59:53.920
 I'm unborable.

1:59:53.920 --> 1:59:55.840
 There's so much joy for me.

1:59:55.840 --> 1:59:58.560
 I think for everyone, but okay, let me just speak for me,

1:59:58.560 --> 2:00:02.740
 to be discovered in getting really good at anything.

2:00:02.740 --> 2:00:04.280
 In fact, getting good at stuff

2:00:04.280 --> 2:00:09.280
 that most people believe is boring or menial labor

2:00:09.320 --> 2:00:14.120
 or impossible to be interesting,

2:00:14.120 --> 2:00:17.040
 that's even more joyful to find the joy within that

2:00:17.040 --> 2:00:17.880
 and the excellence.

2:00:17.880 --> 2:00:19.400
 It's the Jiro dreams of sushi,

2:00:19.400 --> 2:00:22.560
 making the same fricking sushi over and over

2:00:22.560 --> 2:00:25.720
 and becoming a master that can be truly joyful.

2:00:25.720 --> 2:00:29.360
 There's a sense of pride and on the pragmatic level,

2:00:29.360 --> 2:00:31.640
 you never know when someone will spot that.

2:00:31.640 --> 2:00:34.480
 And intelligent people who perform

2:00:34.480 --> 2:00:36.840
 at the level of high excellence look for others.

2:00:36.840 --> 2:00:37.680
 Who do you say?

2:00:37.680 --> 2:00:39.320
 And it radiates some kind of signal.

2:00:39.320 --> 2:00:40.160
 It's weird.

2:00:40.160 --> 2:00:43.660
 It's weird what you attract to yourself

2:00:43.660 --> 2:00:45.760
 when you just focus on mastery

2:00:45.760 --> 2:00:48.440
 and pursuing excellence in something.

2:00:48.440 --> 2:00:51.840
 Like this is the cool thing about it.

2:00:51.840 --> 2:00:53.960
 That's the joy I've really truly experienced.

2:00:53.960 --> 2:00:55.060
 I didn't have to do much work.

2:00:55.060 --> 2:00:56.760
 It's just cool people kind of,

2:00:56.760 --> 2:00:58.840
 I find myself in groups of cool people,

2:00:58.840 --> 2:01:01.120
 like really people who are excited about life,

2:01:01.120 --> 2:01:02.600
 who are passionate about life.

2:01:02.600 --> 2:01:04.060
 There's a fire in their eyes.

2:01:04.060 --> 2:01:07.860
 That's at the end of the day just makes life fun.

2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:11.020
 And then also money wise,

2:01:11.020 --> 2:01:12.420
 at least in this society,

2:01:12.420 --> 2:01:15.080
 we're fortunate to where if you do that kind of thing,

2:01:15.080 --> 2:01:16.440
 money will find a way.

2:01:16.440 --> 2:01:17.780
 Like I have the great,

2:01:17.780 --> 2:01:20.000
 I say this that I don't care about money.

2:01:21.820 --> 2:01:23.580
 I have to think about what that means

2:01:23.580 --> 2:01:25.200
 because some people criticize that idea.

2:01:25.200 --> 2:01:27.560
 It's like, yeah, it must be nice to say that.

2:01:28.560 --> 2:01:30.040
 Cause I have for much,

2:01:30.040 --> 2:01:32.240
 many periods of my life had very little money,

2:01:32.240 --> 2:01:34.560
 but I think we live in a society

2:01:34.560 --> 2:01:36.400
 where not caring about money,

2:01:36.400 --> 2:01:38.960
 but just focusing on your passions.

2:01:38.960 --> 2:01:41.560
 If you're truly pursuing excellence, whatever that is,

2:01:41.560 --> 2:01:42.480
 money will find you.

2:01:42.480 --> 2:01:44.720
 That's I guess the ideal of the capitalist system.

2:01:44.720 --> 2:01:46.760
 And I think that the entrepreneurs I've studied

2:01:46.760 --> 2:01:48.240
 and had the chance to get to know,

2:01:48.240 --> 2:01:49.360
 and I'm sure you'd agree with this,

2:01:49.360 --> 2:01:50.960
 they do what they do

2:01:50.960 --> 2:01:53.320
 cause they're passionate about the product.

2:01:53.320 --> 2:01:55.600
 They're not just in it to make money.

2:01:55.600 --> 2:01:57.240
 In fact, that's when they get into trouble

2:01:57.240 --> 2:01:58.440
 when they're just trying to make money.

2:01:58.440 --> 2:01:59.280
 Exactly.

2:02:00.800 --> 2:02:02.480
 You said your grandmother, Emily,

2:02:02.480 --> 2:02:04.280
 had a big impact on your life.

2:02:04.280 --> 2:02:07.340
 She lived to 102.

2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:10.160
 What are some lessons she taught you?

2:02:11.520 --> 2:02:13.820
 Emily, who was the child of immigrants

2:02:13.820 --> 2:02:15.960
 from Russia and Poland,

2:02:15.960 --> 2:02:17.360
 who never went to college,

2:02:18.320 --> 2:02:21.520
 her proudest day I think was when I went to college.

2:02:21.520 --> 2:02:26.520
 She treated everyone with respect

2:02:27.560 --> 2:02:28.660
 and tried to get to know everyone.

2:02:28.660 --> 2:02:31.020
 She knew every bus driver in the town.

2:02:31.020 --> 2:02:33.420
 She'd remember their birthdays.

2:02:33.420 --> 2:02:35.340
 And one of the things she taught me is

2:02:35.340 --> 2:02:37.940
 no matter how high you fly,

2:02:37.940 --> 2:02:40.740
 the lowest person close to the ground matters to you.

2:02:41.700 --> 2:02:43.860
 And you treat them the same way

2:02:43.860 --> 2:02:47.180
 you treat the billionaire at the top of the podium.

2:02:47.180 --> 2:02:48.080
 And she did that.

2:02:48.080 --> 2:02:49.600
 She didn't just say that.

2:02:49.600 --> 2:02:50.820
 Some people say that and don't do it.

2:02:50.820 --> 2:02:52.100
 She really did that.

2:02:52.100 --> 2:02:56.780
 And I always remember that it comes up in my mind

2:02:56.780 --> 2:02:57.660
 at least once a week

2:02:57.660 --> 2:03:00.420
 because we're all busy doing a lot of things

2:03:01.300 --> 2:03:04.100
 and you either see or you even feel in yourself

2:03:04.100 --> 2:03:07.220
 the desire to just, for the reasons of speed,

2:03:07.220 --> 2:03:09.980
 to be short or not polite with someone

2:03:09.980 --> 2:03:12.320
 who can't do anything to harm you right now.

2:03:13.320 --> 2:03:15.500
 And I remember her saying to me,

2:03:15.500 --> 2:03:18.620
 no, you don't, you treat everyone with respect.

2:03:18.620 --> 2:03:21.060
 You treat the person you're on the phone with,

2:03:21.060 --> 2:03:22.500
 customer service.

2:03:22.500 --> 2:03:24.500
 You treat that person if you're talking to Jeff Bezos

2:03:24.500 --> 2:03:26.300
 or you're talking to Elon Musk.

2:03:27.260 --> 2:03:29.780
 And I think making that a culture

2:03:29.780 --> 2:03:31.500
 of who you are is so important.

2:03:31.500 --> 2:03:32.460
 And people notice that.

2:03:32.460 --> 2:03:33.520
 That's the other thing.

2:03:33.520 --> 2:03:34.780
 And they notice when it's authentic.

2:03:34.780 --> 2:03:36.420
 Everyone's nice to the person at the bottom

2:03:36.420 --> 2:03:38.740
 of the totem pole when you want to get ahead in the line

2:03:38.740 --> 2:03:40.380
 for your driver's license.

2:03:40.380 --> 2:03:42.460
 But are you nice to them when you don't need that?

2:03:42.460 --> 2:03:43.300
 They notice that.

2:03:43.300 --> 2:03:45.180
 And even when nobody's watching,

2:03:45.180 --> 2:03:47.100
 that has a weird effect on you

2:03:47.100 --> 2:03:51.240
 that's going to have a ripple effect and people know.

2:03:51.240 --> 2:03:52.660
 That's the cool thing about the internet.

2:03:52.660 --> 2:03:55.280
 I've come to believe that people see authenticity.

2:03:55.280 --> 2:03:57.500
 They see when you're full of shit, when you're not.

2:03:57.500 --> 2:03:58.340
 That's right.

2:03:58.340 --> 2:03:59.900
 The other thing that Emily taught me,

2:03:59.900 --> 2:04:02.140
 and I think we've all had relatives who have taught us this,

2:04:02.140 --> 2:04:04.020
 that you could be very uneducated.

2:04:04.020 --> 2:04:05.140
 She was very uneducated.

2:04:05.140 --> 2:04:06.940
 She had a high school diploma,

2:04:06.940 --> 2:04:11.060
 but I think she was working in a delicatessen in New York

2:04:11.060 --> 2:04:12.080
 while she was in high school,

2:04:12.080 --> 2:04:13.460
 or maybe it was at Gimbels or somebody.

2:04:13.460 --> 2:04:14.860
 So she probably didn't take high school very seriously.

2:04:14.860 --> 2:04:16.020
 She wasn't very well educated.

2:04:16.020 --> 2:04:17.420
 She was very smart.

2:04:17.420 --> 2:04:19.740
 And we can fall into a world

2:04:19.740 --> 2:04:21.960
 where I'm a big believer in higher education

2:04:21.960 --> 2:04:24.380
 and getting a PhD and things of that sort,

2:04:24.380 --> 2:04:26.540
 but where we think those are the only smart people.

2:04:26.540 --> 2:04:27.380
 Yeah.

2:04:29.280 --> 2:04:31.020
 Sometimes those are the people,

2:04:31.020 --> 2:04:32.380
 because of their accomplishments,

2:04:32.380 --> 2:04:33.740
 because their egos are the ones

2:04:33.740 --> 2:04:38.740
 who are least educated in the way of the world.

2:04:38.940 --> 2:04:39.940
 Yeah.

2:04:39.940 --> 2:04:44.860
 Least curious, and ultimately wisdom comes from curiosity.

2:04:44.860 --> 2:04:49.660
 And sometimes getting a PhD can get in the way of curiosity

2:04:49.660 --> 2:04:51.260
 as opposed to empower curiosity.

2:04:54.180 --> 2:04:58.300
 Let me ask, from a historical perspective,

2:04:58.300 --> 2:05:00.940
 you've studied some of human history.

2:05:00.940 --> 2:05:02.800
 So maybe you have an insight

2:05:02.800 --> 2:05:04.400
 about what's the meaning of life.

2:05:07.860 --> 2:05:10.260
 Do you ever ask when you look at history, the why?

2:05:10.260 --> 2:05:13.740
 Yeah, I do all the time, and I don't have an answer.

2:05:13.740 --> 2:05:16.260
 It's the mystery that we can't answer.

2:05:16.260 --> 2:05:20.340
 I do think what it means is what we make of it.

2:05:21.940 --> 2:05:24.980
 There's no universal, every period I've studied,

2:05:24.980 --> 2:05:26.420
 and I've studied a little bit of a lot of periods

2:05:26.420 --> 2:05:28.000
 and a lot of a few periods,

2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:29.420
 every period people struggle with this,

2:05:29.420 --> 2:05:31.140
 and they don't come to,

2:05:31.140 --> 2:05:34.500
 wiser people than us don't come to a firm answer,

2:05:34.500 --> 2:05:37.060
 except it's what you make of it.

2:05:37.060 --> 2:05:38.380
 Meaning is what you make of it.

2:05:38.380 --> 2:05:42.240
 So think about what you want to care about

2:05:42.240 --> 2:05:44.940
 and make that the meaning in your life.

2:05:44.940 --> 2:05:48.140
 I wonder how that changes throughout human history,

2:05:48.140 --> 2:05:50.260
 whether there's a constant.

2:05:50.260 --> 2:05:52.560
 Like I often think,

2:05:52.560 --> 2:05:55.340
 especially when you study evolutionary biology

2:05:55.340 --> 2:05:59.220
 and you just see our origins from life and as it evolves,

2:05:59.220 --> 2:06:01.100
 it's like, it makes you wonder,

2:06:02.260 --> 2:06:05.640
 it feels like there's a thread that connects all of it,

2:06:06.820 --> 2:06:11.060
 that we're headed somewhere.

2:06:11.060 --> 2:06:16.060
 We're trying to actualize some greater purpose.

2:06:17.420 --> 2:06:20.180
 Like there seems to be a direction to this thing,

2:06:20.180 --> 2:06:22.140
 and we're all kind of stumbling in the dark

2:06:22.140 --> 2:06:24.060
 trying to figure it out,

2:06:24.060 --> 2:06:27.380
 but it feels like we eventually will find an answer.

2:06:28.400 --> 2:06:30.000
 I hope so, yeah, maybe.

2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:35.000
 I mean, I do think we all want our families to do better.

2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:39.560
 We are familiar,

2:06:39.560 --> 2:06:41.320
 and family doesn't just mean biological family.

2:06:41.320 --> 2:06:42.680
 You can have all kinds of ways

2:06:42.680 --> 2:06:44.220
 you define family and community,

2:06:44.220 --> 2:06:47.760
 and I think we are moving slowly

2:06:47.760 --> 2:06:52.200
 and in a very messy way toward a larger world community.

2:06:53.100 --> 2:06:54.900
 To include all of biological life

2:06:54.900 --> 2:06:58.680
 and eventually artificial life as well.

2:06:58.680 --> 2:07:03.680
 Yeah, so to expand the lesson to the advice

2:07:05.680 --> 2:07:08.040
 that your grandmother taught you,

2:07:08.040 --> 2:07:11.200
 is I think we should treat robots and AI systems

2:07:12.160 --> 2:07:15.480
 good as well, even if they're currently not very intelligent

2:07:15.480 --> 2:07:16.960
 because one day they might be.

2:07:16.960 --> 2:07:18.580
 Right, right, I think that's exactly right,

2:07:18.580 --> 2:07:20.220
 and we should think through,

2:07:21.760 --> 2:07:24.520
 exactly as a humanist how I would approach that issue.

2:07:24.520 --> 2:07:27.760
 We need to think through the kinds of behavior patterns

2:07:27.760 --> 2:07:31.280
 we want to establish with these new forms of life,

2:07:31.280 --> 2:07:35.800
 artificial life for ourselves also, to your point,

2:07:35.800 --> 2:07:38.400
 so we behave the right way, so we don't misuse this.

2:07:39.720 --> 2:07:42.280
 We started talking about Abraham Lincoln,

2:07:42.280 --> 2:07:44.600
 ended talking about robots.

2:07:44.600 --> 2:07:47.040
 I think this is the perfect conversation, Jeremy.

2:07:47.040 --> 2:07:48.960
 This was a huge honor.

2:07:48.960 --> 2:07:52.360
 I love Austin, I love UT Austin,

2:07:52.360 --> 2:07:54.400
 and I love the fact that you would agree

2:07:54.400 --> 2:07:56.600
 to waste all your valuable time with me today.

2:07:56.600 --> 2:07:57.880
 Thank you so much for talking to me.

2:07:57.880 --> 2:08:00.440
 I can't imagine a better way to spend a Friday afternoon.

2:08:00.440 --> 2:08:03.120
 This was so much fun, and I'm such a fan of your podcast

2:08:03.120 --> 2:08:04.800
 and delighted to be a part of it.

2:08:04.800 --> 2:08:06.440
 Thank you.

2:08:06.440 --> 2:08:07.920
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

2:08:07.920 --> 2:08:11.920
 with Jeremy Suri, and thank you to Element, Monkpac,

2:08:11.920 --> 2:08:15.840
 Belcampo, Four Sigmatic, and Asleep.

2:08:15.840 --> 2:08:19.260
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

2:08:19.260 --> 2:08:21.440
 And now, let me leave you with some words

2:08:21.440 --> 2:08:24.960
 from Franklin D. Roosevelt, FDR.

2:08:24.960 --> 2:08:27.320
 Democracy cannot succeed unless those

2:08:27.320 --> 2:08:31.560
 who express their choice are prepared to choose wisely.

2:08:31.560 --> 2:08:35.960
 The real safeguard of democracy, therefore, is education.

2:08:35.960 --> 2:08:55.320
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
