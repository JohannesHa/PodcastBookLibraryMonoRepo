00:00.000 --> 00:02.480
 The following is a conversation with Charles Isbell

00:02.480 --> 00:03.840
 and Michael Whitman.

00:03.840 --> 00:06.280
 Charles is the Dean of the College of Computing

00:06.280 --> 00:09.600
 at Georgia Tech and Michael is a computer science professor

00:09.600 --> 00:10.840
 at Brown University.

00:10.840 --> 00:14.880
 I've spoken with each of them individually on this podcast

00:14.880 --> 00:17.360
 and since they are good friends in real life,

00:17.360 --> 00:19.160
 we all thought it would be fun

00:19.160 --> 00:21.760
 to have a conversation together.

00:21.760 --> 00:23.400
 Quick mention of each sponsor,

00:23.400 --> 00:26.040
 followed by some thoughts related to the episode.

00:26.040 --> 00:28.440
 Thank you to Athletic Greens,

00:28.440 --> 00:30.920
 the all in one drink that I start every day with

00:30.920 --> 00:33.240
 to cover all my nutritional bases.

00:33.240 --> 00:35.960
 Eight Sleep, a mattress that cools itself

00:35.960 --> 00:38.920
 and gives me yet another reason to enjoy sleep.

00:38.920 --> 00:40.760
 Masterclass, online courses

00:40.760 --> 00:43.640
 from some of the most amazing humans in history

00:43.640 --> 00:47.460
 and Cash App, the app I use to send money to friends.

00:47.460 --> 00:49.840
 Please check out the sponsors in the description

00:49.840 --> 00:53.020
 to get a discount and to support this podcast.

00:53.020 --> 00:55.800
 As a side note, let me say that having two guests

00:55.800 --> 00:57.800
 on the podcast is an experiment

00:57.800 --> 01:00.040
 that I've been meaning to do for a while.

01:00.040 --> 01:02.580
 In particular, because down the road,

01:02.580 --> 01:05.680
 I would like to occasionally be a kind of moderator

01:05.680 --> 01:09.120
 for debates between people that may disagree

01:09.120 --> 01:10.720
 in some interesting ways.

01:10.720 --> 01:13.780
 If you have suggestions for who you would like to see debate

01:13.780 --> 01:16.220
 on this podcast, let me know.

01:16.220 --> 01:18.620
 As with all experiments of this kind,

01:18.620 --> 01:20.600
 it is a learning process.

01:20.600 --> 01:23.720
 Both the video and the audio might need improvement.

01:23.720 --> 01:25.800
 I realized I think I should probably do

01:25.800 --> 01:27.400
 three or more cameras next time

01:27.400 --> 01:28.960
 as opposed to just two.

01:28.960 --> 01:31.720
 And also try different ways to mount the microphone

01:31.720 --> 01:34.680
 for the third person.

01:34.680 --> 01:36.900
 Also, after recording this intro,

01:36.900 --> 01:40.200
 I'm going to have to go figure out the thumbnail

01:40.200 --> 01:42.140
 for the video version of the podcast

01:42.140 --> 01:45.680
 since I usually put the guest's head on the thumbnail.

01:45.680 --> 01:49.800
 And now there's two heads and two names

01:49.800 --> 01:52.540
 to try to fit into the thumbnail.

01:52.540 --> 01:55.160
 It's a kind of a bin packing problem

01:55.160 --> 01:58.420
 which in theoretical computer science

01:58.420 --> 02:02.320
 happens to be an NP hard problem.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.720
 Whatever I come up with, if you have better ideas

02:04.720 --> 02:06.760
 for the thumbnail, let me know as well.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.680
 And in general, I always welcome ideas

02:08.680 --> 02:10.360
 how this thing can be improved.

02:10.360 --> 02:12.680

02:21.120 --> 02:24.880
 And now here's my conversation with Charles Isbell

02:24.880 --> 02:26.260
 and Michael Littman.

02:27.220 --> 02:30.360
 You'll probably disagree about this question,

02:30.360 --> 02:33.560
 but what is your biggest, would you say, disagreement

02:33.560 --> 02:37.200
 about either something profound and very important

02:37.200 --> 02:39.760
 or something completely not important at all?

02:39.760 --> 02:42.080
 I don't think we have any disagreements at all.

02:42.080 --> 02:44.280
 I'm not sure that's true.

02:44.280 --> 02:45.680
 We walked into that one, didn't we?

02:45.680 --> 02:48.840
 So one thing that you sometimes mention is that,

02:48.840 --> 02:51.920
 and we did this one on air too, as it were,

02:51.920 --> 02:52.960
 whether or not machine learning

02:52.960 --> 02:55.280
 is computational statistics.

02:55.280 --> 02:56.120
 It's not.

02:57.000 --> 02:57.840
 But it is.

02:57.840 --> 02:58.680
 Well, it's not.

02:58.680 --> 03:00.520
 And in particular, and more importantly,

03:00.520 --> 03:02.820
 it is not just computational statistics.

03:02.820 --> 03:04.520
 So what's missing in the picture?

03:04.520 --> 03:05.520
 All the rest of it.

03:05.520 --> 03:07.560
 What's missing?

03:07.560 --> 03:08.520
 That which is missing.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.360
 Oh, yes, well, you can't be wrong now.

03:10.360 --> 03:11.560
 Well, it's not just the statistics.

03:11.560 --> 03:12.700
 He doesn't even believe this.

03:12.700 --> 03:14.260
 We've had this conversation before.

03:14.260 --> 03:15.720
 If it were just the statistics,

03:15.720 --> 03:18.920
 then we would be happy with where we are.

03:18.920 --> 03:19.760
 But it's not just the statistics.

03:19.760 --> 03:21.440
 That's why it's computational statistics.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.720
 Or if it were just the computational.

03:22.720 --> 03:24.720
 I agree that machine learning is not just statistics.

03:24.720 --> 03:25.560
 It is not just statistics.

03:25.560 --> 03:26.440
 We can agree on that.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.040
 Nor is it just computational statistics.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.360
 It's computational statistics.

03:29.360 --> 03:30.180
 It is computational.

03:30.180 --> 03:33.100
 What is the computational and computational statistics?

03:33.100 --> 03:35.120
 Does this take us into the realm of computing?

03:35.120 --> 03:37.800
 It does, but I think perhaps the way I can get him

03:37.800 --> 03:42.800
 to admit that he's wrong is that it's about rules.

03:43.280 --> 03:44.160
 It's about rules.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.040
 It's about symbols.

03:45.040 --> 03:45.880
 It's about all these other things.

03:45.880 --> 03:47.520
 But statistics is not about rules?

03:47.520 --> 03:48.920
 I'm gonna say statistics is about rules.

03:48.920 --> 03:50.160
 But it's not just the statistics, right?

03:50.160 --> 03:51.840
 It's not just a random variable that you choose

03:51.840 --> 03:52.680
 and you have a probability.

03:52.680 --> 03:54.520
 I think you have a narrow view of statistics.

03:54.520 --> 03:56.960
 Okay, well then what would be the broad view of statistics

03:56.960 --> 03:58.440
 that would still allow it to be statistics

03:58.440 --> 04:01.360
 and not say history that would make

04:01.360 --> 04:03.000
 computational statistics okay?

04:03.000 --> 04:07.200
 Well, okay, so I had my first sort of research mentor,

04:07.200 --> 04:08.600
 a guy named Tom Landauer,

04:09.500 --> 04:12.400
 taught me to do some statistics, right?

04:12.400 --> 04:14.940
 And I was annoyed all the time

04:14.940 --> 04:16.080
 because the statistics would say

04:16.080 --> 04:19.280
 that what I was doing was not statistically significant.

04:19.280 --> 04:23.360
 And I was like, but, but, and basically what he said to me

04:23.360 --> 04:25.120
 is statistics is how you're gonna keep

04:25.120 --> 04:29.640
 from lying to yourself, which I thought was really deep.

04:29.640 --> 04:33.280
 It is a way to keep yourself honest in a particular way.

04:33.280 --> 04:34.120
 I agree with that.

04:34.120 --> 04:36.960
 Yeah, and so you're trying to find rules.

04:36.960 --> 04:38.600
 I'm just gonna bring it back to rules.

04:38.600 --> 04:43.600
 Wait, wait, wait, could you possibly try to define rules?

04:44.000 --> 04:47.680
 Even regular statisticians, noncomputational statisticians,

04:47.680 --> 04:51.200
 do spend some of their time evaluating rules, right?

04:51.200 --> 04:52.760
 Applying statistics to try to understand

04:52.760 --> 04:54.760
 does this rule capture this?

04:54.760 --> 04:55.600
 Does this not capture that?

04:55.600 --> 04:57.560
 You mean like hypothesis testing kind of thing?

04:57.560 --> 04:59.360
 Or like confidence intervals?

04:59.360 --> 05:01.600
 I think more like hypothesis.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.080
 Like I feel like the word statistic

05:03.080 --> 05:04.680
 literally means like a summary,

05:04.680 --> 05:06.880
 like a number that summarizes other numbers.

05:06.880 --> 05:08.280
 But I think the field of statistics

05:08.280 --> 05:11.420
 actually applies that idea to things like rules,

05:11.420 --> 05:15.320
 to understand whether or not a rule is valid.

05:15.320 --> 05:18.160
 Does software engineering statistics?

05:18.160 --> 05:19.000
 No.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.820
 Programming languages statistics?

05:20.820 --> 05:21.660
 No.

05:21.660 --> 05:22.480
 Because I think there's a very,

05:22.480 --> 05:24.640
 it's useful to think about a lot of what AI

05:24.640 --> 05:26.520
 and machine learning is or certainly should be

05:26.520 --> 05:29.520
 as software engineering, as programming languages.

05:29.520 --> 05:33.480
 Just to put it in language that you might understand,

05:33.480 --> 05:35.680
 the hyperparameters beyond the problem itself.

05:35.680 --> 05:37.000
 The hyperparameters is too many syllables

05:37.000 --> 05:37.840
 for me to understand.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.720
 The hyperparameters.

05:39.720 --> 05:40.560
 That's better.

05:40.560 --> 05:41.380
 That goes around it, right?

05:41.380 --> 05:42.840
 It's the decisions you choose to make.

05:42.840 --> 05:44.880
 It's the metrics you choose to use.

05:44.880 --> 05:45.720
 It's the loss function.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.160
 You wanna say the practice of machine learning

05:48.160 --> 05:50.080
 is different than the practice of statistics.

05:50.080 --> 05:51.560
 Like the things you have to worry about

05:51.560 --> 05:53.480
 and how you worry about them are different,

05:53.480 --> 05:54.640
 therefore they're different.

05:54.640 --> 05:55.560
 Right.

05:55.560 --> 05:57.920
 At a very little, I mean, at the very least.

05:57.920 --> 05:59.080
 It's that much is true.

05:59.080 --> 06:00.280
 It doesn't mean that statistics,

06:00.280 --> 06:02.400
 computational or otherwise aren't important.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.240
 I think they are.

06:03.240 --> 06:05.680
 I mean, I do a lot of that, for example.

06:05.680 --> 06:06.920
 But I think it goes beyond that.

06:06.920 --> 06:09.200
 I think that we could think about game theory

06:09.200 --> 06:10.100
 in terms of statistics,

06:10.100 --> 06:12.600
 but I don't think it's very as useful to do.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.040
 I mean, the way I would think about it

06:14.040 --> 06:17.380
 or a way I would think about it is this way.

06:17.380 --> 06:19.020
 Chemistry is just physics.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.180
 But I don't think it's as useful to think about chemistry

06:22.180 --> 06:23.320
 as being just physics.

06:23.320 --> 06:25.560
 It's useful to think about it as chemistry.

06:25.560 --> 06:27.180
 The level of abstraction really matters here.

06:27.180 --> 06:28.520
 So I think it is,

06:28.520 --> 06:30.420
 there are contexts in which it is useful.

06:30.420 --> 06:31.260
 Yes.

06:31.260 --> 06:32.080
 I think of it that way, right?

06:32.080 --> 06:33.160
 So finding that connection is actually helpful.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.760
 And I think that's when I emphasize

06:34.760 --> 06:36.120
 the computational statistics thing.

06:36.120 --> 06:41.120
 I think I want to befriend statistics and not absorb them.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.760
 Here's the A way to think about it

06:43.760 --> 06:44.800
 beyond what I just said, right?

06:44.800 --> 06:47.200
 So what would you say,

06:47.200 --> 06:48.440
 and I want you to think back to a conversation

06:48.440 --> 06:49.520
 we had a very long time ago.

06:49.520 --> 06:52.120
 What would you say is the difference between,

06:52.120 --> 06:54.560
 say, the early 2000s, ICML

06:54.560 --> 06:57.240
 and what we used to call NIPS, NeurIPS?

06:57.240 --> 06:58.400
 Is there a difference?

06:58.400 --> 06:59.960
 A lot of, particularly on the machine learning

06:59.960 --> 07:00.960
 that was done there?

07:00.960 --> 07:02.960
 ICML was around that long.

07:02.960 --> 07:03.800
 Oh, yeah.

07:03.800 --> 07:06.880
 So iClear is the new conference, newish.

07:06.880 --> 07:07.720
 Yeah, I guess so.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.120
 And ICML was around the 2000.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.280
 So ICML predates that.

07:12.280 --> 07:15.520
 I think my most cited ICML paper is from 94.

07:15.520 --> 07:16.480
 Michael knows this better than me

07:16.480 --> 07:18.000
 because, of course, he's significantly older than I am.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.600
 But the point is, what is the difference

07:20.600 --> 07:24.440
 between ICML and NeurIPS in the late 90s, early 2000s?

07:24.440 --> 07:26.500
 I don't know what everyone else's perspective would be,

07:26.500 --> 07:28.920
 but I had a particular perspective at that time,

07:28.920 --> 07:31.120
 which is I felt like ICML was more

07:31.120 --> 07:33.560
 of a computer science place

07:33.560 --> 07:37.140
 and that NIPS, NeurIPS was more of an engineering place,

07:37.140 --> 07:40.560
 like the kind of math that happened at the two places.

07:40.560 --> 07:41.520
 As a computer scientist,

07:41.520 --> 07:44.480
 I felt more comfortable with the ICML math.

07:44.480 --> 07:46.520
 And the NeurIPS people would say

07:46.520 --> 07:48.880
 that that's because I'm dumb.

07:48.880 --> 07:51.720
 And that's such an engineering thing to say, so.

07:51.720 --> 07:52.560
 I agree with that part of it,

07:52.560 --> 07:53.400
 but I do it a little differently.

07:53.400 --> 07:54.760
 We actually had a nice conversation

07:54.760 --> 07:57.320
 with Tom Dietrich about this in public.

07:57.320 --> 07:58.560
 On Twitter just a couple of days ago.

07:58.560 --> 07:59.520
 I put it a little differently,

07:59.520 --> 08:02.360
 which is that ICML was machine learning done

08:02.360 --> 08:04.600
 by a computer scientist.

08:04.600 --> 08:07.960
 And NeurIPS was machine learning done

08:07.960 --> 08:10.920
 by a computer scientist trying to impress statisticians.

08:12.920 --> 08:15.080
 Which was weird because it was the same people,

08:15.080 --> 08:17.260
 at least by the time I started paying attention.

08:17.260 --> 08:18.940
 But it just felt very, very different.

08:18.940 --> 08:20.960
 And I think that that perspective

08:20.960 --> 08:22.760
 of whether you're trying to impress the statisticians

08:22.760 --> 08:24.300
 or you're trying to impress the programmers

08:24.300 --> 08:26.720
 is actually very different and has real impact

08:26.720 --> 08:29.600
 on what you choose to worry about

08:29.600 --> 08:31.440
 and what kind of outcomes you come to.

08:31.440 --> 08:32.680
 So I think it really matters.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.480
 I think computational statistics is a means to an end.

08:34.480 --> 08:36.080
 It is not an end in some sense.

08:36.980 --> 08:39.120
 And I think that really matters here

08:39.120 --> 08:40.760
 in the same way that I don't think computer science

08:40.760 --> 08:42.120
 is just engineering or just science

08:42.120 --> 08:43.160
 or just math or whatever.

08:43.160 --> 08:44.880
 Okay, so I'd have to now agree

08:44.880 --> 08:46.280
 that now we agree on everything.

08:46.280 --> 08:47.780
 Yes, yes.

08:47.780 --> 08:49.280
 The important thing here is that

08:50.560 --> 08:51.760
 my opinions may have changed,

08:51.760 --> 08:53.000
 but not the fact that I'm right,

08:53.000 --> 08:54.600
 I think is what we just came to.

08:54.600 --> 08:55.920
 Right, and my opinions may have changed

08:55.920 --> 08:57.380
 and not the fact that I'm wrong.

08:57.380 --> 08:58.220
 That's right.

08:59.120 --> 08:59.960
 You lost me.

08:59.960 --> 09:00.780
 I'm not even.

09:00.780 --> 09:01.760
 I think I lost myself there too.

09:01.760 --> 09:04.320
 But anyway, we're back.

09:04.320 --> 09:05.440
 This happens to us sometimes.

09:05.440 --> 09:06.280
 We're sorry.

09:06.280 --> 09:08.840
 How does neural networks change this,

09:08.840 --> 09:11.120
 just to even linger on this topic,

09:11.120 --> 09:14.680
 change this idea of statistics,

09:15.600 --> 09:17.720
 how big of a pie statistics is

09:17.720 --> 09:19.220
 within the machine learning thing?

09:19.220 --> 09:22.000
 Like, because it sounds like hyperparameters

09:22.000 --> 09:24.280
 and also just the role of data.

09:24.280 --> 09:25.920
 You know, people are starting to use

09:25.920 --> 09:28.440
 this terminology of software 2.0,

09:28.440 --> 09:31.140
 which is like the act of programming

09:31.140 --> 09:35.800
 as a, like you're a designer

09:35.800 --> 09:38.240
 in the hyperparameter space of neural networks,

09:38.240 --> 09:40.760
 and you're also the collector and the organizer

09:40.760 --> 09:44.080
 and the cleaner of the data,

09:44.080 --> 09:45.900
 and that's part of the programming.

09:47.040 --> 09:52.040
 So how did, on the NeurIPS versus ICML topic,

09:52.040 --> 09:54.000
 what's the role of neural networks

09:54.000 --> 09:57.320
 in redefining the size and the role of machine learning?

09:57.320 --> 10:00.120
 I can't wait to hear what Michael thinks about this,

10:00.120 --> 10:01.280
 but I would add one.

10:01.280 --> 10:02.120
 But you will.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.320
 That's true, I will, I'll force myself to.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.320
 I think there's one other thing

10:06.320 --> 10:07.400
 I would add to your description,

10:07.400 --> 10:09.120
 which is the kind of software engineering part

10:09.120 --> 10:10.920
 of what does it mean to debug, for example.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.080
 But this is a difference between

10:13.080 --> 10:14.800
 the kind of computational statistics view

10:14.800 --> 10:16.840
 of machine learning and the computational view

10:16.840 --> 10:18.600
 of machine learning, which is, I think,

10:18.600 --> 10:20.800
 one is worried about the equation, as it were.

10:20.800 --> 10:23.120
 And by the way, this is not a value judgment.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.960
 I just think it's about perspective.

10:24.960 --> 10:26.440
 But the kind of questions you would ask

10:26.440 --> 10:27.320
 when you start asking yourself,

10:27.320 --> 10:28.320
 well, what does it mean to program

10:28.320 --> 10:29.720
 and develop and build the system,

10:29.720 --> 10:33.080
 is a very computer sciencey view of the problem.

10:33.080 --> 10:35.960
 I mean, if you get on data science Twitter

10:35.960 --> 10:39.620
 and econ Twitter, you actually hear this a lot

10:39.620 --> 10:43.000
 with the economist and the data scientist

10:43.000 --> 10:44.600
 complaining about the machine learning people.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.280
 Well, it's just statistics,

10:46.280 --> 10:47.800
 and I don't know why they don't see this.

10:47.800 --> 10:49.360
 But they're not even asking the same questions.

10:49.360 --> 10:50.780
 They're not thinking about it

10:50.780 --> 10:53.160
 as a kind of programming problem.

10:53.160 --> 10:54.620
 And I think that that really matters,

10:54.620 --> 10:55.980
 just asking this question.

10:55.980 --> 10:57.020
 I actually think it's a little different

10:57.020 --> 11:00.640
 from programming in hyperparameter space

11:00.640 --> 11:03.120
 and sort of collecting the data.

11:03.120 --> 11:06.040
 But I do think that that immersion really matters.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.920
 So I'll give you a quick example

11:07.920 --> 11:08.760
 of the way I think about this.

11:08.760 --> 11:09.840
 So I teach machine learning.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.040
 Michael and I have co taught a machine learning class,

11:12.040 --> 11:14.960
 which has now reached, I don't know, 10,000 people at least

11:14.960 --> 11:17.040
 over the last several years, or somewhere there's abouts.

11:17.040 --> 11:21.400
 And my machine learning assignments are of this form.

11:21.400 --> 11:23.820
 So the first one is something like,

11:23.820 --> 11:25.400
 implement these five algorithms,

11:25.400 --> 11:29.680
 KNN and SVMs and boosting and decision trees

11:29.680 --> 11:32.560
 and neural networks, and maybe that's it, I can't remember.

11:32.560 --> 11:34.500
 And when I say implement, I mean steal the code.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.000
 I am completely uninterested.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.800
 You get zero points for getting the thing to work.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.640
 I don't want you spending your time worrying about

11:41.640 --> 11:44.280
 getting the corner case right of what happens

11:44.280 --> 11:46.320
 when you are trying to normalize distances

11:46.320 --> 11:47.480
 and the points on the thing.

11:47.480 --> 11:48.320
 And so you divide by zero.

11:48.320 --> 11:50.020
 I'm not interested in that, right?

11:50.020 --> 11:51.480
 Steal the code.

11:51.480 --> 11:54.080
 However, you're going to run those algorithms

11:54.080 --> 11:55.840
 on two data sets.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.960
 The data sets have to be interesting.

11:57.960 --> 11:58.880
 What does it mean to be interesting?

11:58.880 --> 12:01.060
 Well, data sets interesting if it reveals differences

12:01.060 --> 12:03.760
 between algorithms, which presumably are all the same

12:03.760 --> 12:06.160
 because they can represent whatever they can represent.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.680
 And two data sets are interesting together

12:07.680 --> 12:10.720
 if they show different differences, as it were.

12:10.720 --> 12:11.920
 And you have to analyze them.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.280
 You have to justify their interestingness

12:13.280 --> 12:15.180
 and you have to analyze them in a whole bunch of ways.

12:15.180 --> 12:17.480
 But all I care about is the data in your analysis,

12:17.480 --> 12:18.340
 not the programming.

12:18.340 --> 12:20.720
 And I occasionally end up in these long discussions

12:20.720 --> 12:22.880
 with students, well, I don't really,

12:22.880 --> 12:24.440
 I copy and paste the things that I've said

12:24.440 --> 12:26.320
 the other 15,000 times it's come up,

12:26.320 --> 12:29.020
 which is they go, but the only way to learn,

12:29.020 --> 12:31.320
 really understand is to code them up,

12:31.320 --> 12:33.480
 which is a very programmer,

12:33.480 --> 12:35.220
 software engineering view of the world.

12:35.220 --> 12:37.360
 If you don't program it, you don't understand it,

12:37.360 --> 12:39.020
 which is, by the way, I think is wrong

12:39.020 --> 12:40.600
 in a very specific way.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.880
 But it is a way that you come to understand

12:42.880 --> 12:44.820
 because then you have to wrestle with the algorithm.

12:44.820 --> 12:45.960
 But the thing about machine learning

12:45.960 --> 12:47.660
 is it's not just sorting numbers

12:47.660 --> 12:49.180
 where in some sense the data doesn't matter.

12:49.180 --> 12:50.980
 What matters is, well, does the algorithm work

12:50.980 --> 12:53.020
 on these abstract things, one less than the other?

12:53.020 --> 12:54.780
 In machine learning, the data matters.

12:54.780 --> 12:57.200
 It matters more than almost anything.

12:57.200 --> 12:59.780
 And not everything, but almost anything.

12:59.780 --> 13:02.120
 And so as a result, you have to live with the data

13:02.120 --> 13:04.960
 and don't get distracted by the algorithm per se.

13:04.960 --> 13:07.840
 And I think that that focus on the data

13:07.840 --> 13:09.040
 and what it can tell you

13:09.040 --> 13:11.840
 and what question it's actually answering for you

13:11.840 --> 13:14.000
 as opposed to the question you thought you were asking

13:14.000 --> 13:16.360
 is a key and important thing about machine learning

13:16.360 --> 13:18.960
 and is a way that computationalists

13:18.960 --> 13:21.800
 as opposed to statisticians bring a particular view

13:21.800 --> 13:23.320
 about how to think about the process.

13:23.320 --> 13:25.600
 The statisticians, by contrast, bring,

13:25.600 --> 13:27.880
 I think I'd be willing to say,

13:27.880 --> 13:31.360
 a better view about the kind of formal math that's behind it

13:31.360 --> 13:35.040
 and what an actual number ultimately is saying

13:35.040 --> 13:35.960
 about the data.

13:35.960 --> 13:38.520
 And those are both important, but they're also different.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.360
 I didn't really think of it this way

13:40.360 --> 13:44.480
 is to build intuition about the role of data,

13:44.480 --> 13:45.940
 the different characteristics of data

13:45.940 --> 13:48.160
 by having two data sets that are different

13:48.160 --> 13:50.880
 and they reveal the differences in the differences.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.160
 That's a really fascinating,

13:52.160 --> 13:55.000
 that's a really interesting educational approach.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.500
 The students love it, but not right away.

13:57.500 --> 13:58.340
 No, they love it at the end.

13:58.340 --> 13:59.160
 They love it later.

13:59.160 --> 14:00.100
 They love it at the end.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.200
 Not at the beginning.

14:02.520 --> 14:04.360
 Not even immediately after.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.280
 I feel like there's a deep profound lesson

14:06.280 --> 14:07.560
 about education there.

14:07.560 --> 14:08.400
 Yeah.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.920
 That you can't listen to students

14:10.920 --> 14:14.080
 about whether what you're doing is the right

14:14.080 --> 14:15.140
 or the wrong thing.

14:15.140 --> 14:19.220
 Yeah, well, as a wise, Michael Lippmann once said to me

14:19.220 --> 14:22.060
 about children, which I think applies to teaching,

14:22.060 --> 14:24.940
 is you have to give them what they need

14:24.940 --> 14:27.120
 without bending to their will.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.060
 And students are like that.

14:28.060 --> 14:29.060
 You have to figure out what they need.

14:29.060 --> 14:29.900
 You're a curator.

14:29.900 --> 14:32.060
 Your whole job is to curate and to present

14:32.060 --> 14:33.240
 because on their own,

14:33.240 --> 14:35.060
 they're not gonna necessarily know where to search.

14:35.060 --> 14:37.160
 So you're providing pushes in some direction

14:37.160 --> 14:41.300
 and learn space and you have to give them what they need

14:42.300 --> 14:44.500
 in a way that keeps them engaged enough

14:44.500 --> 14:46.860
 so that they eventually discover what they want

14:46.860 --> 14:48.100
 and they get the tools they need to go

14:48.100 --> 14:50.060
 and learn other things off of.

14:50.060 --> 14:52.180
 What's your view?

14:52.180 --> 14:54.260
 Let me put on my Russian hat,

14:54.260 --> 14:55.780
 which believes that life is suffering.

14:55.780 --> 14:56.820
 I like Russian hats, by the way.

14:56.820 --> 14:58.100
 If you have one, I would like this.

14:58.100 --> 14:59.420
 Those are ridiculous, yes.

14:59.420 --> 15:01.460
 But in a delightful way.

15:01.460 --> 15:02.300
 But sure.

15:04.040 --> 15:06.300
 What do you think is the role of,

15:06.300 --> 15:08.140
 we talked about balance a little bit.

15:08.140 --> 15:11.740
 What do you think is the role of hardship in education?

15:11.740 --> 15:15.540
 Like I think the biggest things I've learned,

15:16.540 --> 15:20.260
 like what made me fall in love with math, for example,

15:20.260 --> 15:24.700
 is by being bad at it until I got good at it.

15:24.700 --> 15:28.400
 So like struggling with a problem,

15:28.400 --> 15:31.160
 which increased the level of joy I felt

15:31.160 --> 15:33.440
 when I finally figured it out.

15:33.440 --> 15:37.220
 And it always felt with me, with teachers,

15:37.220 --> 15:39.760
 especially modern discussions of education,

15:39.760 --> 15:42.420
 how can we make education more fun,

15:42.420 --> 15:44.900
 more engaging, more all those things?

15:44.900 --> 15:46.940
 Or from my perspective, it's like,

15:46.940 --> 15:49.220
 you're maybe missing the point

15:49.220 --> 15:51.780
 that education, that life is suffering.

15:52.740 --> 15:54.840
 Education is supposed to be hard

15:54.840 --> 15:57.860
 and that actually what increases the joy you feel

15:57.860 --> 15:59.540
 when you actually learn something.

15:59.540 --> 16:02.340
 Is that ridiculous?

16:02.340 --> 16:04.380
 Do you like to see your students suffer?

16:04.380 --> 16:07.460
 Okay, so this may be a point where we differ.

16:07.460 --> 16:08.620
 I suspect not.

16:08.620 --> 16:10.180
 I'm gonna do go on.

16:10.180 --> 16:11.220
 Well, what would your answer be?

16:11.220 --> 16:12.060
 I wanna hear you first.

16:12.060 --> 16:14.420
 Okay, well, I was gonna not answer the question.

16:14.420 --> 16:18.180
 You don't want the students to know you enjoy them suffering?

16:18.180 --> 16:19.020
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.660
 I was gonna say that there's,

16:21.700 --> 16:23.700
 I think there's a distinction that you can make

16:23.700 --> 16:25.020
 in the kind of suffering, right?

16:25.020 --> 16:27.060
 So I think you can be in a mode

16:27.060 --> 16:30.300
 where you're suffering in a hopeless way

16:30.300 --> 16:33.400
 versus you're suffering in a hopeful way, right?

16:33.400 --> 16:37.260
 Where you're like, you can see that if you,

16:37.260 --> 16:39.200
 that you still have,

16:39.200 --> 16:41.940
 you can still imagine getting to the end, right?

16:41.940 --> 16:43.640
 And as long as people are in that mindset

16:43.640 --> 16:44.480
 where they're struggling,

16:44.480 --> 16:47.460
 but it's not a hopeless kind of struggling,

16:47.460 --> 16:49.060
 that's productive.

16:49.060 --> 16:50.540
 I think that's really helpful.

16:50.540 --> 16:53.700
 But it's struggling, like if you break their will,

16:53.700 --> 16:56.140
 if you leave them hopeless.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.660
 No, that don't, sure, some people are gonna,

16:58.660 --> 17:00.500
 whatever, lift themselves up by their bootstraps,

17:00.500 --> 17:01.940
 but like mostly you give up

17:01.940 --> 17:03.520
 and certainly it takes the joy out of it.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.740
 And you're not gonna spend a lot of time

17:05.740 --> 17:07.860
 on something that brings you no joy.

17:07.860 --> 17:10.380
 So it is a bit of a delicate balance, right?

17:10.380 --> 17:12.920
 You have to thwart people in a way

17:12.920 --> 17:17.020
 that they still believe that there's a way through.

17:17.020 --> 17:20.020
 Right, so that's a, we strongly agree actually.

17:20.020 --> 17:21.140
 So I think, well, first off,

17:21.140 --> 17:24.060
 struggling and suffering aren't the same thing, right?

17:24.060 --> 17:25.340
 Yeah, just being poetic.

17:25.340 --> 17:27.660
 Oh, no, no, I actually appreciate the poetry.

17:27.660 --> 17:29.720
 And one of the reasons I appreciate it

17:29.720 --> 17:31.860
 is that they are often the same thing

17:31.860 --> 17:32.900
 and often quite different, right?

17:32.900 --> 17:34.580
 So you can struggle without suffering,

17:34.580 --> 17:37.220
 you can certainly suffer pretty easily.

17:37.220 --> 17:38.820
 You don't necessarily have to struggle to suffer.

17:38.820 --> 17:41.860
 So I think that you want people to struggle,

17:41.860 --> 17:42.940
 but that hope matters.

17:42.940 --> 17:44.620
 You have to, they have to understand

17:44.620 --> 17:46.500
 that they're gonna get through it on the other side.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.740
 And it's very easy to confuse the two.

17:50.060 --> 17:52.580
 I actually think Brown University has a very,

17:52.580 --> 17:55.420
 just philosophically has a very different take

17:55.420 --> 17:56.780
 on the relationship with their students,

17:56.780 --> 17:59.300
 particularly undergrads from say a place like Georgia Tech,

17:59.300 --> 18:00.140
 which is.

18:00.140 --> 18:01.780
 Which university is better?

18:01.780 --> 18:03.340
 Well, I have my opinions on that.

18:03.340 --> 18:05.260
 I mean, remember, Charles said,

18:05.260 --> 18:07.500
 it doesn't matter what the facts are, I'm always right.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.780
 The correct answer is that it doesn't matter,

18:09.780 --> 18:10.980
 they're different.

18:10.980 --> 18:14.460
 But clearly, clearly the answer is different.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.900
 He went to a school like the school

18:16.900 --> 18:18.500
 where he is as an undergrad.

18:18.500 --> 18:21.060
 I went to a school, specifically the same school,

18:21.060 --> 18:23.500
 though it was changed a bit in the intervening years.

18:23.500 --> 18:24.340
 Brown or Georgia Tech?

18:24.340 --> 18:25.260
 No, I was talking about Georgia Tech.

18:25.260 --> 18:28.180
 And I went to an undergrad place

18:28.180 --> 18:29.780
 that's a lot like the place where I work now.

18:29.780 --> 18:32.360
 And so it does seem like we're more familiar

18:32.360 --> 18:33.280
 with these models.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.500
 So there's a similarity between Brown and Yale?

18:35.500 --> 18:38.380
 Yeah, I think they're quite similar, yeah.

18:38.380 --> 18:39.260
 And Duke.

18:39.260 --> 18:40.900
 Duke has some similarities too,

18:40.900 --> 18:42.940
 but it's got a little Southern draw.

18:42.940 --> 18:43.860
 You've kind of worked your,

18:43.860 --> 18:45.540
 you've sort of worked at universities

18:45.540 --> 18:48.800
 that are like the places where you learned.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.180
 And the same would be true for me.

18:52.180 --> 18:56.100
 Are you uncomfortable venturing outside the box?

18:56.100 --> 18:57.300
 Is that what you're saying?

18:57.300 --> 18:58.120
 Journeying out?

18:58.120 --> 18:58.960
 That's not what I'm saying.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.060
 Yeah, Charles is definitely.

19:00.060 --> 19:01.100
 He only goes to places

19:01.100 --> 19:02.960
 that have institute in the name, right?

19:02.960 --> 19:04.060
 It has worked out that way.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.180
 Well, academic places anyway.

19:06.180 --> 19:08.260
 Well, no, I was a visiting scientist at UPenn

19:08.260 --> 19:11.120
 or visiting something at UPenn.

19:11.120 --> 19:14.120
 Oh, wow, I just understood your joke.

19:14.120 --> 19:14.960
 Which one?

19:14.960 --> 19:18.020
 Five minutes later.

19:18.020 --> 19:20.020
 I like to set the sort of time bomb.

19:20.020 --> 19:22.060
 The institute is in the,

19:22.060 --> 19:23.620
 that Charles only goes to places

19:23.620 --> 19:25.780
 that have institute in the name.

19:25.780 --> 19:27.560
 So I guess Georgia,

19:27.560 --> 19:28.860
 I forget that Georgia Tech

19:28.860 --> 19:30.740
 is Georgia Institute of Technology.

19:30.740 --> 19:32.440
 The number of people who refer to it

19:32.440 --> 19:34.300
 as Georgia Tech University is large

19:34.300 --> 19:35.620
 and incredibly irritating.

19:35.620 --> 19:37.820
 It's one of the few things

19:37.820 --> 19:39.220
 that genuinely gets under my skin.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.180
 But like schools like Georgia Tech and MIT

19:41.180 --> 19:42.780
 have as part of the ethos,

19:42.780 --> 19:43.900
 like there is,

19:43.900 --> 19:45.900
 I wanna say there's an abbreviation

19:45.900 --> 19:47.660
 that someone taught me,

19:47.660 --> 19:49.700
 like IHTFP, something like that.

19:49.700 --> 19:51.300
 Like there's an expression

19:51.300 --> 19:53.460
 which is basically I hate being here,

19:53.460 --> 19:55.580
 which they say so proudly.

19:55.580 --> 19:57.980
 And that is definitely not the ethos at Brown.

19:57.980 --> 19:58.820
 Like Brown is,

19:58.820 --> 20:01.140
 there's a little more pampering

20:01.140 --> 20:02.260
 and empowerment and stuff.

20:02.260 --> 20:03.780
 And it's not like we're gonna crush you

20:03.780 --> 20:04.980
 and you're gonna love it.

20:04.980 --> 20:06.300
 So yeah, I think there's a,

20:06.300 --> 20:09.300
 I think the ethoses are different.

20:09.300 --> 20:10.300
 That's interesting, yeah.

20:10.300 --> 20:12.100
 We had Drown Proofing.

20:12.100 --> 20:12.940
 What's that?

20:12.940 --> 20:14.500
 In order to graduate from Georgia Tech,

20:14.500 --> 20:15.320
 this is a true thing.

20:15.320 --> 20:16.940
 Feel free to look it up.

20:16.940 --> 20:17.780
 If you.

20:17.780 --> 20:19.220
 A lot of schools have this by the way.

20:19.220 --> 20:20.900
 No, actually Georgia Tech was barely the first.

20:20.900 --> 20:21.940
 Brandeis has it.

20:21.940 --> 20:23.260
 Had it.

20:23.260 --> 20:25.020
 I feel like Georgia Tech was the first

20:25.020 --> 20:27.460
 in a lot of things.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.860
 It was the first in a lot of things.

20:28.860 --> 20:29.700
 Had the first master's degree.

20:29.700 --> 20:30.600
 First Bumblebee mascot.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.300
 Stop that.

20:32.300 --> 20:34.300
 First master's in computer science actually.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.620
 Right, online master's.

20:35.620 --> 20:37.800
 Well that too, but way back in the 60s.

20:37.800 --> 20:38.640
 NSF grant.

20:38.640 --> 20:39.480
 Yeah, yeah.

20:39.480 --> 20:40.300
 You're the first information

20:40.300 --> 20:42.820
 and computer science master's degree in the country.

20:42.820 --> 20:45.660
 But the Georgia Tech,

20:45.660 --> 20:46.580
 it used to be the case

20:46.580 --> 20:48.300
 that in order to graduate from Georgia Tech,

20:48.300 --> 20:49.980
 you had to take a Drown Proofing class.

20:49.980 --> 20:52.340
 Where effectively, they threw you in the water

20:52.340 --> 20:53.180
 and tied you up.

20:53.180 --> 20:54.620
 If you didn't drown, you got to graduate.

20:54.620 --> 20:55.780
 Tied you up?

20:55.780 --> 20:56.620
 I believe so.

20:56.620 --> 20:57.440
 No.

20:57.440 --> 20:58.500
 There were certainly versions of it,

20:58.500 --> 21:00.460
 but I mean luckily they ended it

21:00.460 --> 21:01.620
 just before I had to graduate

21:01.620 --> 21:03.220
 because otherwise I would have never graduated.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.300
 It wasn't going to happen.

21:04.300 --> 21:06.460
 I want to say 84, 83,

21:06.460 --> 21:08.100
 somewhere around then they ended it.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.420
 But yeah, you used to have to prove

21:10.420 --> 21:13.220
 you could tread water for some ridiculous amount of time

21:13.220 --> 21:14.060
 or you couldn't graduate.

21:14.060 --> 21:14.900
 Two minutes.

21:14.900 --> 21:15.720
 No, it was more than two minutes.

21:15.720 --> 21:16.560
 I bet it was two minutes.

21:16.560 --> 21:17.400
 Okay, well we'll look at it.

21:17.400 --> 21:18.340
 And it was in a bathtub.

21:18.340 --> 21:19.180
 Yeah, right.

21:19.180 --> 21:20.020
 You could just stare.

21:20.020 --> 21:20.900
 It was in a pool.

21:20.900 --> 21:21.740
 But it was a real thing.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.500
 But that idea that, you know, push you.

21:23.500 --> 21:24.380
 Fully clothed.

21:24.380 --> 21:25.300
 Yeah, fully clothed.

21:25.300 --> 21:27.460
 I bet it was that and not tied up.

21:27.460 --> 21:30.420
 Because who needs to learn how to swim when you're tied?

21:30.420 --> 21:31.260
 Nobody.

21:31.260 --> 21:32.540
 But who needs to learn to swim

21:32.540 --> 21:34.220
 when you're actually falling into the water dressed?

21:34.220 --> 21:35.060
 That's a real thing.

21:35.060 --> 21:36.700
 I think your facts are getting in the way

21:36.700 --> 21:37.540
 with a good story.

21:37.540 --> 21:38.360
 Oh, that's fair.

21:38.360 --> 21:39.200
 That's fair.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.040
 I didn't mean to.

21:40.040 --> 21:40.860
 All right, so they tie you up.

21:40.860 --> 21:41.980
 Sometimes the narrative matters.

21:41.980 --> 21:43.300
 But whatever it was, you had to,

21:43.300 --> 21:44.820
 it was called drown proofing for a reason.

21:44.820 --> 21:49.500
 The point of the story, Michael, is that it's,

21:49.500 --> 21:50.700
 well, no, but that's good.

21:50.700 --> 21:52.340
 It doesn't bring it back to struggle.

21:52.340 --> 21:54.980
 That's a part of what Georgia Tech has always been.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.740
 And we struggle with that, by the way,

21:56.740 --> 21:59.860
 about what we want to be, particularly as things go.

21:59.860 --> 22:02.140
 But you sort of,

22:02.140 --> 22:06.660
 how much can you be pushed without breaking?

22:06.660 --> 22:08.940
 And you come out of the other end stronger, right?

22:08.940 --> 22:09.780
 There's a saying we used to have

22:09.780 --> 22:10.620
 when I was an undergrad there.

22:10.620 --> 22:11.660
 It was just Georgia Tech,

22:11.660 --> 22:13.700
 building tomorrow the night before.

22:13.700 --> 22:14.540
 Right?

22:14.540 --> 22:17.780
 And it was just kind of idea that,

22:17.780 --> 22:19.460
 give me something impossible to do

22:19.460 --> 22:20.900
 and I'll do it in a couple of days

22:20.900 --> 22:21.900
 because that's what I just spent

22:21.900 --> 22:24.140
 the last four or five or six years with.

22:24.140 --> 22:26.860
 That ethos definitely stuck to you.

22:26.860 --> 22:28.980
 Having now done a number of projects with you,

22:28.980 --> 22:30.420
 you definitely will do it the night before.

22:30.420 --> 22:31.340
 That's not entirely true.

22:31.340 --> 22:33.620
 There's nothing wrong with waiting until the last minute.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.660
 The secret is knowing when the last minute is.

22:35.660 --> 22:38.260
 Right, that's brilliantly put.

22:38.260 --> 22:41.700
 Yeah, that is a definite Charles statement

22:41.700 --> 22:43.380
 that I am trying not to embrace.

22:44.860 --> 22:45.700
 And I appreciate that

22:45.700 --> 22:47.700
 because you helped move my last minute up.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.300
 That's the social construct

22:49.300 --> 22:50.780
 the way you converge together

22:50.780 --> 22:53.140
 what the definition of last minute is.

22:53.140 --> 22:54.660
 We figure that all out together.

22:54.660 --> 22:58.580
 In fact, MIT, I'm sure a lot of universities have this,

22:58.580 --> 23:00.380
 but MIT has like MIT time

23:00.380 --> 23:03.740
 that everyone has always agreed together

23:03.740 --> 23:05.500
 that there is such a concept

23:05.500 --> 23:08.740
 and everyone just keeps showing up like 10 to 15 to 20,

23:08.740 --> 23:11.420
 depending on the department, late to everything.

23:11.420 --> 23:13.940
 So there's like a weird drift that happens.

23:13.940 --> 23:14.900
 It's kind of fascinating.

23:14.900 --> 23:15.980
 Yeah, we're five minutes.

23:15.980 --> 23:16.820
 We're five minutes.

23:16.820 --> 23:18.620
 In fact, the classes will say,

23:18.620 --> 23:20.380
 well, this is no longer true actually,

23:20.380 --> 23:22.540
 but it used to be a class that started at eight,

23:22.540 --> 23:24.180
 but actually it started at eight oh five,

23:24.180 --> 23:26.460
 it ends at nine, actually it ends at eight fifty five.

23:26.460 --> 23:27.460
 Everything's five minutes off

23:27.460 --> 23:29.420
 and nobody expects anything to start until five minutes

23:29.420 --> 23:31.580
 after the half hour, whatever it is.

23:31.580 --> 23:32.420
 It still exists.

23:32.420 --> 23:33.260
 It hurts my head.

23:33.260 --> 23:37.860
 Well, let's rewind the clock back to the fifties and sixties

23:37.860 --> 23:39.580
 when you guys met, how did you,

23:39.580 --> 23:40.820
 I'm just kidding, I don't know.

23:40.820 --> 23:43.100
 But what, can you tell the story of how you met?

23:43.100 --> 23:45.420
 So you've, like the internet and the world

23:45.420 --> 23:50.180
 kind of knows you as connected in some ways

23:50.180 --> 23:53.100
 in terms of education of teaching the world.

23:53.100 --> 23:54.740
 That's like the public facing thing,

23:54.740 --> 23:56.740
 but how did you as human beings

23:56.740 --> 24:00.700
 and as collaborators meet?

24:00.700 --> 24:01.780
 I think there's two stories.

24:01.780 --> 24:05.260
 One is how we met and the other is how we

24:05.260 --> 24:06.220
 got to know each other.

24:06.220 --> 24:08.260
 I'm not gonna say fell in love.

24:08.260 --> 24:11.180
 I'm gonna say that we came to understand that we

24:11.180 --> 24:13.660
 Had some common something.

24:13.660 --> 24:14.620
 Yeah, it's funny.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.660
 Cause on the surface, I think we're different

24:16.660 --> 24:18.820
 in a lot of ways, but there's something

24:18.820 --> 24:21.740
 Yeah, I mean, now we complete each other's

24:21.740 --> 24:22.580
 There you go.

24:22.580 --> 24:23.580
 Afternoon.

24:23.580 --> 24:25.980
 So I will tell the story of how we met

24:25.980 --> 24:27.940
 and I'll let Michael tell the story of how we met.

24:27.940 --> 24:28.780
 Okay, all right.

24:28.780 --> 24:30.140
 Okay, so here's how we met.

24:30.140 --> 24:32.980
 I was already at that point, it was AT&T labs.

24:32.980 --> 24:34.180
 There's a long, interesting story there.

24:34.180 --> 24:38.780
 But anyway, I was there and Michael was coming to interview.

24:38.780 --> 24:40.300
 He was a professor at Duke at the time,

24:40.300 --> 24:44.100
 but decided for reasons that he wanted to be in New Jersey.

24:45.140 --> 24:48.860
 And so that would mean Bell Labs slash AT&T labs.

24:48.860 --> 24:49.700
 And we were doing the interview.

24:49.700 --> 24:51.540
 Interviews are very much like academic interviews.

24:51.540 --> 24:53.220
 And so I had to be there.

24:53.220 --> 24:54.860
 We all had to meet with him afterwards

24:54.860 --> 24:56.180
 and so on, one on one.

24:56.180 --> 24:59.460
 But it was obvious to me that he was going to be hired.

24:59.460 --> 25:01.100
 Like no matter what, because everyone loved him.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.300
 They were just talking about all the great stuff he did.

25:03.300 --> 25:04.300
 Oh, he did this great thing.

25:04.300 --> 25:06.500
 And you had just won something at AAAI, I think.

25:06.500 --> 25:08.580
 Or maybe you got 18 papers in AAAI that year.

25:08.580 --> 25:10.260
 I got the best paper award at AAAI

25:10.260 --> 25:11.380
 for the crossword stuff.

25:11.380 --> 25:12.220
 Right, exactly.

25:12.220 --> 25:14.020
 So that had all happened and everyone was going on

25:14.020 --> 25:14.860
 and on and on about it.

25:14.860 --> 25:16.600
 Actually, so Tinder was saying incredibly nice things

25:16.600 --> 25:17.440
 about you.

25:17.440 --> 25:18.260
 Really?

25:18.260 --> 25:19.100
 Yes.

25:19.100 --> 25:19.940
 He can be very grumpy.

25:19.940 --> 25:20.760
 Yes.

25:20.760 --> 25:21.600
 That's nice to hear.

25:21.600 --> 25:22.500
 He was grumpily saying very nice things.

25:22.500 --> 25:23.340
 Oh, that makes sense.

25:23.340 --> 25:24.180
 And that does make sense.

25:24.180 --> 25:25.940
 So, you know, it was going to come.

25:25.940 --> 25:28.060
 So why was I meeting him?

25:28.060 --> 25:29.060
 I had something else I had to do.

25:29.060 --> 25:29.900
 I can't remember what it was.

25:29.900 --> 25:31.300
 It probably involved comedy.

25:31.300 --> 25:32.340
 So he remembers meeting me

25:32.340 --> 25:34.180
 as inconveniencing his afternoon.

25:34.180 --> 25:35.020
 So he came.

25:35.020 --> 25:36.140
 So I eventually came to my office.

25:36.140 --> 25:37.080
 I was in the middle of trying to do something.

25:37.080 --> 25:37.920
 I can't remember what.

25:37.920 --> 25:38.980
 And he came and he sat down.

25:38.980 --> 25:41.160
 And for reasons that are purely accidental,

25:41.160 --> 25:42.560
 despite what Michael thinks,

25:42.560 --> 25:44.740
 my desk at the time was set up

25:44.740 --> 25:46.660
 in such a way that it had sort of an L shape.

25:46.660 --> 25:48.740
 And the chair on the outside was always lower

25:48.740 --> 25:50.380
 than the chair that I was in.

25:50.380 --> 25:52.620
 And, you know, the kind of point was to...

25:52.620 --> 25:54.440
 The only reason I think that it was on purpose

25:54.440 --> 25:56.220
 is because you told me it was on purpose.

25:56.220 --> 25:57.060
 I don't remember that.

25:57.060 --> 25:59.020
 Anyway, the thing is, is that, you know, it kind of gives...

25:59.020 --> 26:00.260
 His guest chair was really low

26:00.260 --> 26:02.940
 so that he could look down at everybody.

26:02.940 --> 26:04.940
 The idea was just to simply create a nice environment

26:04.940 --> 26:06.220
 that you were asking for a mortgage

26:06.220 --> 26:07.120
 and I was going to say no.

26:07.120 --> 26:07.960
 That was the point.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.500
 It was a very simple idea here.

26:09.500 --> 26:10.980
 Anyway, so we sat there

26:10.980 --> 26:12.260
 and we just talked for a little while.

26:12.260 --> 26:14.460
 And I think he got the impression that I didn't like him.

26:14.460 --> 26:15.300
 Which wasn't true.

26:15.300 --> 26:16.120
 I strongly got that impression.

26:16.120 --> 26:16.960
 The talk was really good.

26:16.960 --> 26:18.680
 The talk, by the way, was terrible.

26:18.680 --> 26:20.300
 And right after the talk,

26:20.300 --> 26:21.700
 I said to my host, Michael Kearns,

26:21.700 --> 26:23.340
 who ultimately was my boss.

26:23.340 --> 26:24.180
 I'm a huge fan.

26:24.180 --> 26:25.780
 I'm a friend and a huge fan of Michael, yeah.

26:25.780 --> 26:28.140
 Yeah, he is a remarkable person.

26:29.660 --> 26:30.980
 After my talk, I went into the...

26:30.980 --> 26:32.420
 He went into basketball.

26:32.420 --> 26:33.260
 I went...

26:33.260 --> 26:34.080
 Racquetball, he's good at everything.

26:34.080 --> 26:34.920
 No, basketball.

26:34.920 --> 26:36.020
 No, but basketball and racquetball too.

26:36.020 --> 26:36.860
 Squash.

26:36.860 --> 26:38.180
 Squash, squash, squash, not racquetball.

26:38.180 --> 26:39.980
 Yes, squash, which is not...

26:39.980 --> 26:41.420
 Racquetball, yes.

26:41.420 --> 26:42.240
 Squash, no.

26:42.240 --> 26:43.980
 And I hope you hear that, Michael.

26:43.980 --> 26:45.980
 Oh, Michael Kearns.

26:45.980 --> 26:47.580
 As a game, not his skill level,

26:47.580 --> 26:49.140
 because I'm pretty sure he's...

26:50.060 --> 26:51.600
 All right, there's some competitiveness there,

26:51.600 --> 26:54.360
 but the point is that it was like the middle of the day,

26:54.360 --> 26:55.760
 I had full day of interviews.

26:55.760 --> 26:56.620
 I got met with people,

26:56.620 --> 26:58.900
 but then in the middle of the day, I gave a job talk.

26:58.900 --> 27:01.540
 And then there was gonna be more interviews,

27:01.540 --> 27:04.860
 but I pulled Michael aside and I said,

27:04.860 --> 27:07.240
 I think it's in both of our best interest

27:07.240 --> 27:11.100
 if I just leave now, because that was so bad

27:11.100 --> 27:12.540
 that it'd just be embarrassing

27:12.540 --> 27:14.300
 if I have to talk to any more people.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.380
 You look bad for having invited me.

27:16.380 --> 27:19.580
 It's just, let's just forget this ever happened.

27:19.580 --> 27:21.780
 So I don't think the talk went well.

27:21.780 --> 27:23.620
 That's one of the most Michael Lipman set of sentences

27:23.620 --> 27:24.540
 I think I've ever heard.

27:24.540 --> 27:27.220
 He did great, or at least everyone knew he was great,

27:27.220 --> 27:28.220
 so maybe it didn't matter.

27:28.220 --> 27:29.940
 I was there, I remember the talk,

27:29.940 --> 27:31.980
 and I remember him being very much the way

27:31.980 --> 27:33.980
 I remember him now, on any given week.

27:33.980 --> 27:34.800
 So it was good.

27:34.800 --> 27:36.620
 And we met and we talked about stuff.

27:36.620 --> 27:37.940
 He thinks I didn't like him, but...

27:37.940 --> 27:39.340
 Because he was so grumpy.

27:39.340 --> 27:40.740
 Must've been the chair thing.

27:40.740 --> 27:42.700
 The chair thing and the low voice, I think.

27:42.700 --> 27:43.700
 But like, he obviously...

27:43.700 --> 27:47.020
 And that slight skeptical look.

27:47.020 --> 27:48.540
 Yes.

27:48.540 --> 27:50.540
 I have no idea what you're talking about.

27:50.540 --> 27:51.900
 Well, I probably didn't have any idea

27:51.900 --> 27:53.820
 what you were talking about.

27:53.820 --> 27:54.820
 Anyway, I liked him.

27:54.820 --> 27:56.420
 He asked me questions, I answered questions.

27:56.420 --> 27:57.380
 I felt bad about myself.

27:57.380 --> 27:58.340
 It was a normal day.

27:58.340 --> 28:00.540
 It was a normal day.

28:00.540 --> 28:01.380
 And then he left.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.140
 And then he left, and that's how you met.

28:03.140 --> 28:03.980
 Can we take a...

28:03.980 --> 28:05.860
 And then I got hired and I was in the group.

28:05.860 --> 28:09.100
 Can we take a slight tangent on this topic of,

28:09.100 --> 28:11.500
 it sounds like, maybe you could speak

28:11.500 --> 28:12.580
 to the bigger picture.

28:12.580 --> 28:15.060
 It sounds like you're quite self critical.

28:15.060 --> 28:15.900
 Who, Charles?

28:15.900 --> 28:16.720
 No, you.

28:16.720 --> 28:17.560
 Oh.

28:17.560 --> 28:18.560
 I can do better.

28:18.560 --> 28:19.400
 I can do better.

28:19.400 --> 28:20.220
 Try me again.

28:20.220 --> 28:21.060
 I'll do better.

28:21.060 --> 28:21.900
 I'll be so self critical.

28:21.900 --> 28:22.740
 I won't.

28:22.740 --> 28:23.560
 I won't.

28:23.560 --> 28:24.400
 I won't.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.420
 Yeah, that was like a three out of 10 response.

28:26.420 --> 28:30.380
 So let's try to work it up to five and six.

28:30.380 --> 28:35.160
 Yeah, I remember Marvin Minsky said on a video interview,

28:35.160 --> 28:38.820
 something that the key to success in academic research

28:38.820 --> 28:40.420
 is to hate everything you do.

28:43.580 --> 28:44.420
 For some reason...

28:44.420 --> 28:46.820
 I think I followed that because I hate everything he's done.

28:46.820 --> 28:49.740
 That's a good line.

28:49.740 --> 28:52.660
 That's a six out of 10.

28:52.660 --> 28:53.500
 Maybe that's a keeper.

28:53.500 --> 28:57.660
 But do you find that resonates with you at all

28:57.660 --> 28:59.740
 in how you think about talks and so on?

28:59.740 --> 29:00.840
 I would say it differently.

29:00.840 --> 29:01.680
 It's not that.

29:01.680 --> 29:02.500
 No, not really.

29:02.500 --> 29:04.460
 That's such an MIT view of the world though.

29:04.460 --> 29:08.480
 So I remember talking about this when, as a student,

29:08.480 --> 29:10.980
 you were basically told I will clean it up

29:10.980 --> 29:12.580
 for the purpose of the podcast.

29:13.660 --> 29:14.500
 My work is crap.

29:14.500 --> 29:15.320
 My work is crap.

29:15.320 --> 29:16.160
 My work is crap.

29:16.160 --> 29:17.660
 Then you go to a conference or something.

29:17.660 --> 29:18.980
 You're like, everybody else's work is crap.

29:18.980 --> 29:19.820
 Everybody else's work is crap.

29:19.820 --> 29:23.260
 And you feel better and better about it, relatively speaking.

29:23.260 --> 29:25.060
 And then you sort of keep working on it.

29:25.060 --> 29:26.820
 I don't hate my work.

29:26.820 --> 29:27.660
 That resonates with me.

29:27.660 --> 29:28.900
 Yes, I've never hated my work,

29:28.900 --> 29:33.460
 but I have been dissatisfied with it.

29:33.460 --> 29:35.980
 And I think being dissatisfied,

29:35.980 --> 29:38.620
 being okay with the fact that you've taken a positive step,

29:38.620 --> 29:40.340
 the derivative's positive,

29:40.340 --> 29:42.300
 maybe even the second derivative's positive,

29:42.300 --> 29:45.060
 that's important because that's a part of the hope, right?

29:45.060 --> 29:47.300
 But you have to, but I haven't gotten there yet.

29:47.300 --> 29:49.880
 If that's not there, that I haven't gotten there yet,

29:49.880 --> 29:53.460
 then it's hard to move forward, I think.

29:53.460 --> 29:55.100
 So I buy that, which is a little different

29:55.100 --> 29:56.420
 from hating everything that you do.

29:56.420 --> 29:59.300
 Yeah, I mean, there's things that I've done

29:59.300 --> 30:01.260
 that I like better than I like myself.

30:01.260 --> 30:04.040
 So it's separating me from the work, essentially.

30:04.040 --> 30:06.780
 So I think I am very critical of myself,

30:06.780 --> 30:08.700
 but sometimes the work I'm really excited about.

30:08.700 --> 30:10.540
 And sometimes I think it's kind of good.

30:10.540 --> 30:11.380
 Does that happen right away?

30:11.380 --> 30:15.380
 So I found the work that I've liked, that I've done,

30:15.380 --> 30:18.420
 most of it, I liked it in retrospect

30:18.420 --> 30:21.220
 more when I was far away from it in time.

30:21.220 --> 30:24.380
 I have to be fairly excited about it to get done.

30:24.380 --> 30:26.900
 No, excited at the time, but then happy with the result.

30:26.900 --> 30:28.780
 But years later, or even I might go back,

30:28.780 --> 30:31.180
 you know what, that actually turned out to matter.

30:31.180 --> 30:32.020
 That turned out to matter.

30:32.020 --> 30:34.220
 Or, oh gosh, it turns out I've been thinking about that.

30:34.220 --> 30:36.420
 It's actually influenced all the work that I've done since

30:36.420 --> 30:37.860
 without realizing it.

30:37.860 --> 30:39.220
 Boy, that guy was smart.

30:39.220 --> 30:41.300
 Yeah, that guy had a future.

30:41.300 --> 30:46.300
 Yeah, I think there's something to it.

30:47.060 --> 30:48.060
 I think there's something to the idea

30:48.060 --> 30:50.340
 you've got to hate what you do, but it's not quite hate.

30:50.340 --> 30:52.580
 It's just being unsatisfied.

30:52.580 --> 30:54.300
 And different people motivate themselves differently.

30:54.300 --> 30:56.740
 I don't happen to motivate myself with self loathing.

30:56.740 --> 30:58.860
 I happen to motivate myself with something else.

30:58.860 --> 31:02.900
 So you're able to sit back and be proud of,

31:02.900 --> 31:04.780
 in retrospect, of the work you've done.

31:04.780 --> 31:06.540
 Well, and it's easier when you can connect it

31:06.540 --> 31:08.940
 with other people, because then you can be proud of them.

31:08.940 --> 31:10.180
 Proud of the people, yeah.

31:10.180 --> 31:11.020
 And then the question is.

31:11.020 --> 31:12.420
 You can still safely hate yourself.

31:12.420 --> 31:13.700
 Yeah, that's right.

31:13.700 --> 31:15.220
 It's win, win, Michael.

31:15.220 --> 31:18.420
 Or at least win, lose, which is what you're looking for.

31:18.420 --> 31:22.180
 Oh, wow, there's so many brilliant minds in this.

31:22.180 --> 31:23.580
 There's levels.

31:23.580 --> 31:26.020
 So how did you actually meet me?

31:26.020 --> 31:26.860
 Yeah, Michael.

31:26.860 --> 31:28.540
 So the way I think about it is,

31:28.540 --> 31:32.500
 because we didn't do much research together at AT&T,

31:32.500 --> 31:34.540
 but then we all got laid off.

31:34.540 --> 31:36.540
 So that sucked.

31:36.540 --> 31:37.940
 By the way, sorry to interrupt,

31:37.940 --> 31:40.500
 but that was one of the most magical places

31:40.500 --> 31:42.340
 historically speaking.

31:42.340 --> 31:44.260
 They did not appreciate what they had.

31:45.700 --> 31:46.540
 And how do we,

31:47.940 --> 31:50.180
 I feel like there's a profound lesson in there too.

31:50.180 --> 31:53.100
 How do we get it, like what was, why was it so magical?

31:53.100 --> 31:54.940
 Is it just a coincidence of history?

31:54.940 --> 31:56.380
 Or is there something special about?

31:56.380 --> 31:57.740
 There were some really good managers

31:57.740 --> 32:00.460
 and people who really believed in machine learning

32:00.460 --> 32:03.100
 as this is gonna be important.

32:03.100 --> 32:05.620
 Let's get the people who are thinking about this

32:05.620 --> 32:08.060
 in creative and insightful ways

32:08.060 --> 32:10.260
 and put them in one place and stir.

32:10.260 --> 32:11.500
 Yeah, but even beyond that, right?

32:11.500 --> 32:15.540
 It was Bell Labs at its heyday.

32:15.540 --> 32:17.980
 And even when we were there, which I think was past its heyday.

32:17.980 --> 32:19.700
 And to be clear, he's gotten to be at Bell Labs.

32:19.700 --> 32:21.100
 I never got to be at Bell Labs.

32:21.100 --> 32:22.300
 I joined after that.

32:22.300 --> 32:24.620
 Yeah, I showed up in 91 as a grad student.

32:24.620 --> 32:28.420
 So I was there for a long time, every summer, except for two.

32:28.420 --> 32:29.580
 So twice I worked for companies

32:29.580 --> 32:31.900
 that had just stopped being Bell Labs.

32:31.900 --> 32:33.620
 Bellcore and then AT&T Labs.

32:33.620 --> 32:37.300
 So Bell Labs was several locations or for the research

32:37.300 --> 32:38.140
 or is it one?

32:38.140 --> 32:41.020
 I don't know if Jersey's involved somehow.

32:41.020 --> 32:41.900
 They're all in Jersey.

32:41.900 --> 32:42.740
 Yeah, they're all over the place.

32:42.740 --> 32:44.060
 But they were in a couple of places in Jersey.

32:44.060 --> 32:47.420
 Murray Hill was the Bell Labs place.

32:47.420 --> 32:49.820
 So you had an office in Murray Hill

32:49.820 --> 32:51.100
 at one point in your career.

32:51.100 --> 32:53.380
 Yeah, and I played Ultimate Frisbee

32:53.380 --> 32:56.340
 on the cricket pitch at Bell Labs at Murray Hill.

32:56.340 --> 32:58.300
 And then it became AT&T Labs when it split off

32:58.300 --> 33:00.940
 with loose during what we called Trivestiture.

33:00.940 --> 33:03.660
 Are you better than Michael Korn's at Ultimate Frisbee?

33:03.660 --> 33:04.580
 Yeah. Oh, yeah.

33:04.580 --> 33:05.420
 Okay.

33:05.420 --> 33:06.620
 But I think that one's not boasting.

33:06.620 --> 33:08.580
 I think Charles plays a lot of Ultimate

33:08.580 --> 33:10.500
 and I don't think Michael does.

33:10.500 --> 33:12.100
 Yes, but that wasn't the point.

33:12.100 --> 33:12.940
 The point is yes.

33:12.940 --> 33:13.780
 I'm finally better.

33:13.780 --> 33:14.620
 Sorry.

33:14.620 --> 33:17.420
 Okay, I have played on a championship winning

33:17.420 --> 33:19.420
 Ultimate Frisbee team or whatever,

33:19.420 --> 33:20.780
 Ultimate team with Charles.

33:20.780 --> 33:22.660
 So I know how good he is.

33:22.660 --> 33:23.500
 He's really good.

33:23.500 --> 33:24.620
 How good I was anyway, when I was younger.

33:24.620 --> 33:25.460
 But the thing is.

33:25.460 --> 33:26.820
 I know how young he was when he was younger.

33:26.820 --> 33:27.740
 That's true.

33:27.740 --> 33:28.900
 So much younger than now.

33:28.900 --> 33:29.820
 He's older now.

33:29.820 --> 33:30.660
 Yeah, I'm older.

33:30.660 --> 33:33.140
 Michael was a much better basketball player than I was.

33:33.140 --> 33:34.380
 Michael Kearns.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.220
 Yes, no, not Michael.

33:36.220 --> 33:37.060
 Let's be very clear about that.

33:37.060 --> 33:38.820
 To be clear, I've not played basketball with you.

33:38.820 --> 33:40.460
 So you don't know how terrible I am,

33:40.460 --> 33:42.340
 but you have a probably pretty good guess.

33:42.340 --> 33:44.300
 And that you're not as good as Michael Kearns.

33:44.300 --> 33:45.740
 He's tall and athletic.

33:45.740 --> 33:46.580
 And he cared about it.

33:46.580 --> 33:47.420
 He's very athletic.

33:47.420 --> 33:48.240
 He's very good.

33:48.240 --> 33:49.080
 And probably competitive.

33:49.080 --> 33:50.300
 I love hanging out with Michael.

33:50.300 --> 33:51.660
 Anyway, but we were talking about something else,

33:51.660 --> 33:52.980
 although I no longer remember what it was.

33:52.980 --> 33:53.820
 What were we talking about?

33:53.820 --> 33:54.660
 Oh, Bell Labs.

33:54.660 --> 33:55.500
 Oh, Bell Labs.

33:55.500 --> 33:56.340
 But also Labs.

33:56.340 --> 34:00.220
 So this was kind of cool about what was magical about it.

34:00.220 --> 34:01.300
 The first thing you have to know

34:01.300 --> 34:03.500
 is that Bell Labs was an arm of the government, right?

34:03.500 --> 34:05.300
 Because AT&T was an arm of the government.

34:05.300 --> 34:06.500
 It was a monopoly.

34:07.420 --> 34:10.780
 And every month you paid a little thing on your phone bill,

34:10.780 --> 34:12.000
 which turned out was a tax

34:12.000 --> 34:14.340
 for all the research that Bell Labs was doing.

34:14.340 --> 34:16.700
 And they invented transistors and the laser

34:16.700 --> 34:17.540
 and whatever else is that they did.

34:17.540 --> 34:20.580
 The Big Bang or whatever, the cosmic background radiation.

34:20.580 --> 34:21.420
 Yeah, they did all that stuff.

34:21.420 --> 34:23.380
 They had some amazing stuff with directional microphones,

34:23.380 --> 34:24.220
 by the way.

34:24.220 --> 34:25.520
 I got to go in this room

34:25.520 --> 34:27.940
 where they had all these panels and everything.

34:27.940 --> 34:29.460
 And we would talk and one another,

34:29.460 --> 34:30.740
 and he'd move some panels around.

34:30.740 --> 34:33.700
 And then he would have me step two steps to the left.

34:33.700 --> 34:35.100
 And I couldn't hear a thing he was saying

34:35.100 --> 34:37.100
 because nothing was bouncing off the walls.

34:37.100 --> 34:38.460
 And then he would shut it all down

34:38.460 --> 34:40.340
 and you could hear your heartbeat,

34:40.340 --> 34:43.320
 which is deeply disturbing to hear your heartbeat.

34:43.320 --> 34:44.160
 You can feel it.

34:44.160 --> 34:44.980
 I mean, you can feel it now.

34:44.980 --> 34:46.620
 There's just so much all this sort of noise around.

34:46.620 --> 34:48.300
 Anyway, Bell Labs was about pure research.

34:48.300 --> 34:50.420
 It was a university, in some sense,

34:50.420 --> 34:53.660
 the purest sense of a university, but without students.

34:53.660 --> 34:56.300
 So it was all the faculty working with one another

34:56.300 --> 34:57.860
 and students would come in to learn.

34:57.860 --> 34:59.220
 They would come in for three or four months

34:59.220 --> 35:00.860
 during the summer and they would go away.

35:00.860 --> 35:02.820
 But it was just this kind of wonderful experience.

35:02.820 --> 35:04.700
 I could walk out my door.

35:04.700 --> 35:06.540
 In fact, I would often have to walk out my door

35:06.540 --> 35:08.320
 and deal with Rich Sutton and Michael Kearns

35:08.320 --> 35:10.940
 yelling at each other about whatever it is

35:10.940 --> 35:13.380
 they were yelling about the proper way

35:13.380 --> 35:14.620
 to prove something or another.

35:14.620 --> 35:15.580
 And I could just do that.

35:15.580 --> 35:17.980
 And Dave McAllister and Peter Stone

35:17.980 --> 35:19.780
 and all of these other people,

35:19.780 --> 35:22.620
 including, it's a tender and then eventually Michael.

35:22.620 --> 35:25.260
 And it was just a place where you could think thoughts.

35:25.260 --> 35:29.300
 And it was okay because so long as once every 25 years or so

35:29.300 --> 35:31.780
 somebody invented a transistor, it paid for everything else.

35:31.780 --> 35:34.140
 You could afford to take the risk.

35:34.140 --> 35:36.440
 And then when that all went away,

35:36.440 --> 35:39.380
 it became harder and harder and harder to justify it

35:39.380 --> 35:41.500
 as far as the folks who were very far away were concerned.

35:41.500 --> 35:43.540
 And there was such a fast turnaround

35:43.540 --> 35:46.380
 among mental management on the AT&T side

35:46.380 --> 35:48.340
 that you never had a chance to really build a relationship.

35:48.340 --> 35:49.820
 At least people like us didn't have a chance

35:49.820 --> 35:51.460
 to build a relationship.

35:51.460 --> 35:55.500
 So when the diaspora happened, it was amazing, right?

35:55.500 --> 35:57.660
 Everybody left and I think everybody ended up

35:57.660 --> 36:00.060
 at a great place and made a huge,

36:00.060 --> 36:02.700
 continued to do really good work with machine learning.

36:02.700 --> 36:03.740
 But it was a wonderful place.

36:03.740 --> 36:07.060
 And people will ask me, what's the best job you've ever had?

36:07.060 --> 36:10.220
 And as a professor, anyway, the answer that I would give is

36:11.140 --> 36:16.100
 well, probably Bell Labs in some very real sense.

36:16.100 --> 36:17.640
 And I will never have a job like that again

36:17.640 --> 36:19.380
 because Bell Labs doesn't exist anymore.

36:19.380 --> 36:22.280
 And Microsoft research is great and Google does good stuff.

36:22.280 --> 36:24.180
 And you can pick IBM, you can tell if you want to,

36:24.180 --> 36:25.860
 but Bell Labs was magical.

36:25.860 --> 36:28.020
 It was around for, it was an important time

36:28.020 --> 36:30.540
 and it represents a high watermark

36:30.540 --> 36:32.820
 in basic research in the US.

36:32.820 --> 36:35.380
 Is there something you could say about the physical proximity

36:35.380 --> 36:36.660
 and the chance collisions?

36:36.660 --> 36:39.380
 Like we live in this time of the pandemic

36:39.380 --> 36:43.780
 where everyone is maybe trying to see the silver lining

36:43.780 --> 36:46.940
 and accepting the remote nature of things.

36:46.940 --> 36:50.380
 Is there one of the things that people like faculty

36:50.380 --> 36:55.380
 that I talk to miss is the procrastination.

36:57.020 --> 36:59.980
 Like the chance to make everything is about meetings

36:59.980 --> 37:00.960
 that are supposed to be,

37:00.960 --> 37:04.100
 there's not a chance to just talk about comic book

37:04.100 --> 37:07.180
 or whatever, like go into discussion that's totally pointless.

37:07.180 --> 37:08.180
 So it's funny you say this

37:08.180 --> 37:11.100
 because that's how we met, met, it was exactly that.

37:11.100 --> 37:12.780
 So I'll let Michael say that, but I'll just add one thing

37:12.780 --> 37:16.460
 which is just that research is a social process

37:16.460 --> 37:20.140
 and it helps to have random social interactions

37:20.140 --> 37:21.580
 even if they don't feel social at the time,

37:21.580 --> 37:22.760
 that's how you get things done.

37:22.760 --> 37:25.860
 One of the great things about the AI Lab when I was there,

37:25.860 --> 37:27.900
 I don't quite know what it looks like now

37:27.900 --> 37:28.780
 once they moved buildings,

37:28.780 --> 37:30.860
 but we had entire walls that were whiteboards

37:30.860 --> 37:31.860
 and people would just get up there

37:31.860 --> 37:33.620
 and they were just right and people would walk up

37:33.620 --> 37:34.460
 and you'd have arguments

37:34.460 --> 37:36.120
 and you'd explain things to one another

37:36.120 --> 37:39.600
 and you got so much out of the freedom to do that.

37:39.600 --> 37:42.940
 You had to be okay with people challenging

37:42.940 --> 37:44.460
 every fricking word you said,

37:44.460 --> 37:47.220
 which I would sometimes find deeply irritating,

37:47.220 --> 37:49.620
 but most of the time it was quite useful.

37:49.620 --> 37:52.020
 But the sort of pointlessness and the interaction

37:52.020 --> 37:54.780
 was in some sense the point, at least for me.

37:54.780 --> 37:57.540
 Yeah, I think offline yesterday I mentioned

37:57.540 --> 38:01.660
 Josh Tenenbaum and he's very much, he's a man,

38:01.660 --> 38:06.220
 he's such an inspiration in the childlike way

38:06.220 --> 38:07.820
 that he pulls you in on any topic.

38:07.820 --> 38:10.380
 It doesn't even have to be about machine learning

38:10.380 --> 38:12.860
 or the brain, he'll just pull you in

38:12.860 --> 38:15.900
 to a closest writable surface,

38:15.900 --> 38:18.260
 which is still, you can find whiteboards

38:18.260 --> 38:23.260
 at MIT everywhere, and just like basically cancel

38:23.380 --> 38:25.040
 all meetings and talk for a couple hours

38:25.040 --> 38:28.060
 about some aimless thing and it feels like

38:28.060 --> 38:30.820
 the whole world, the time space continuum kind of warps

38:30.820 --> 38:32.740
 and that becomes the most important thing.

38:32.740 --> 38:36.660
 And then it's just, it's definitely something

38:36.660 --> 38:40.140
 worth missing in this world where everything's remote.

38:40.140 --> 38:42.980
 There's some magic to the physical presence.

38:42.980 --> 38:44.940
 Whenever I wonder myself whether MIT really is

38:44.940 --> 38:48.220
 as great as I remember it, I just go talk to Josh.

38:48.220 --> 38:49.760
 Yeah, you know, that's funny.

38:49.760 --> 38:52.780
 There's a few people in this world that carry

38:52.780 --> 38:56.380
 the best of what particular institutions stand for, right?

38:56.380 --> 38:57.220
 And it's.

38:57.220 --> 38:58.060
 It's Josh.

38:58.060 --> 39:00.980
 I mean, I don't, my guess is he's unaware of this.

39:00.980 --> 39:02.020
 That's the point.

39:02.020 --> 39:02.860
 Yeah.

39:02.860 --> 39:05.720
 That the masters are not aware of their mastery.

39:06.680 --> 39:07.520
 So.

39:07.520 --> 39:09.100
 How did we meet?

39:09.100 --> 39:12.380
 Yes, but first a tangent, no.

39:13.700 --> 39:14.700
 How did you meet me?

39:14.700 --> 39:16.100
 So I'm not sure what you were thinking,

39:16.100 --> 39:19.220
 but when it started to dawn on me

39:19.220 --> 39:21.540
 that maybe we had a longer term bond

39:21.540 --> 39:23.980
 was after we all got laid off.

39:23.980 --> 39:26.620
 And you had decided at that point

39:26.620 --> 39:28.460
 that we were still paid.

39:28.460 --> 39:30.980
 We were given an opportunity to like do a job search

39:30.980 --> 39:32.980
 and kind of make a transition,

39:32.980 --> 39:35.220
 but it was clear that we were done.

39:35.220 --> 39:38.400
 And I would go to my office to work

39:38.400 --> 39:41.340
 and you would go to my office to keep me from working.

39:41.340 --> 39:43.500
 That was my recollection of it.

39:43.500 --> 39:44.580
 You had decided that there was no,

39:44.580 --> 39:46.540
 really no point in working for the company

39:46.540 --> 39:49.720
 because our relationship with the company was done.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.260
 Yeah, but remember I felt that way beforehand.

39:51.260 --> 39:52.180
 It wasn't about the company.

39:52.180 --> 39:53.420
 It was about the set of people there

39:53.420 --> 39:54.260
 doing really cool things.

39:54.260 --> 39:55.780
 And it always, always been that way.

39:55.780 --> 39:57.460
 But we were working on something together.

39:57.460 --> 39:58.300
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:58.300 --> 39:59.120
 That's right.

39:59.120 --> 40:00.280
 So at the very end, we all got laid off,

40:00.280 --> 40:04.140
 but then our boss came to, our boss's boss came to us

40:04.140 --> 40:05.620
 because our boss was Michael Kearns

40:05.620 --> 40:08.980
 and he had jumped ship brilliantly, like perfect timing.

40:08.980 --> 40:12.060
 Like things like right before the ship was about to sink,

40:12.060 --> 40:16.820
 he was like, gotta go and landed perfectly

40:16.820 --> 40:18.180
 because Michael Kearns.

40:18.180 --> 40:19.020
 Because Michael Kearns.

40:19.020 --> 40:23.580
 And leaving the rest of us to go like, this is fine.

40:23.580 --> 40:25.780
 And then it was clear that it wasn't fine

40:25.780 --> 40:27.440
 and we were all toast.

40:27.440 --> 40:29.220
 So we had this sort of long period of time.

40:29.220 --> 40:30.860
 But then our boss figured out, okay, wait,

40:30.860 --> 40:33.660
 maybe we can save a couple of these people

40:33.660 --> 40:36.400
 if we can have them do something really useful.

40:37.260 --> 40:40.680
 And the useful thing was we were gonna make

40:40.680 --> 40:42.280
 basically an automated assistant

40:42.280 --> 40:43.900
 that could help you with your calendar.

40:43.900 --> 40:45.700
 You could like tell it things

40:45.700 --> 40:47.860
 and it would respond appropriately.

40:47.860 --> 40:49.700
 It would just kind of integrate across

40:49.700 --> 40:53.600
 all sorts of your personal information.

40:53.600 --> 40:56.700
 And so me and Charles and Peter Stone

40:56.700 --> 40:58.880
 were set up as the crack team

40:58.880 --> 41:00.860
 to actually solve this problem.

41:00.860 --> 41:04.220
 Other people maybe were too theoretical that they thought,

41:04.220 --> 41:05.660
 but we could actually get something done.

41:05.660 --> 41:07.260
 So we sat down to get something done

41:07.260 --> 41:10.100
 and there wasn't time and it wouldn't have saved us anyway.

41:10.100 --> 41:12.060
 And so it all kind of went downhill.

41:12.060 --> 41:15.380
 But the interesting, I think, coda to that

41:15.380 --> 41:18.860
 is that our boss's boss is a guy named Ron Brockman.

41:18.860 --> 41:22.100
 And when he left AT&T,

41:22.100 --> 41:23.820
 cause we were all laid off,

41:23.820 --> 41:27.220
 he went to DARPA, started up a program there

41:27.220 --> 41:28.960
 that became KALO,

41:28.960 --> 41:32.100
 which is the program from which Siri sprung,

41:32.100 --> 41:34.060
 which is a digital assistant

41:34.060 --> 41:35.260
 that helps you with your calendar

41:35.260 --> 41:36.660
 and a bunch of other things.

41:37.660 --> 41:40.860
 It really, in some ways got its start

41:40.860 --> 41:44.440
 with me and Charles and Peter trying to implement this vision

41:44.440 --> 41:45.580
 that Ron Brockman had,

41:45.580 --> 41:47.740
 that he ultimately got implemented

41:47.740 --> 41:49.380
 through his role at DARPA.

41:49.380 --> 41:51.380
 So when I'm trying to feel less bad

41:51.380 --> 41:52.420
 about having been laid off

41:52.420 --> 41:56.020
 from what is possibly the greatest job of all time,

41:56.020 --> 42:00.060
 I think about, well, we kind of helped birth Siri.

42:00.060 --> 42:00.960
 That's something.

42:01.860 --> 42:03.120
 And then he did other things too.

42:03.120 --> 42:06.620
 But we got to spend a lot of time in his office

42:06.620 --> 42:07.860
 and talk about lots of things.

42:07.860 --> 42:10.340
 We got to spend a lot of time in my office, yeah.

42:10.340 --> 42:11.180
 Yeah, yeah.

42:11.180 --> 42:13.460
 And so then we went on our merry way.

42:13.460 --> 42:15.340
 Everyone went to different places.

42:15.340 --> 42:16.540
 Charles landed at Georgia Tech,

42:16.540 --> 42:20.300
 which was what he always dreamed he would do.

42:20.300 --> 42:22.680
 And so that worked out well.

42:23.740 --> 42:25.380
 I came up with a saying at the time,

42:25.380 --> 42:27.980
 which is luck favors the Charles.

42:27.980 --> 42:30.540
 It's kind of like luck favors the prepared,

42:30.540 --> 42:32.940
 but Charles, like he wished something

42:32.940 --> 42:35.460
 and then it would basically happen just the way he wanted.

42:35.460 --> 42:38.500
 It was inspirational to see things go that way.

42:38.500 --> 42:39.340
 Things worked out.

42:39.340 --> 42:40.180
 And we stayed in touch.

42:40.180 --> 42:43.740
 And then I think it really helped

42:43.740 --> 42:46.100
 when you were working on,

42:46.100 --> 42:48.300
 I mean, you'd kept me in the loop for things like threads

42:48.300 --> 42:49.780
 and the work that you were doing at Georgia Tech.

42:49.780 --> 42:50.980
 But then when they were starting

42:50.980 --> 42:52.860
 their online master's program,

42:52.860 --> 42:55.020
 he knew that I was really excited about MOOCs

42:55.020 --> 42:56.140
 and online teaching.

42:56.140 --> 42:57.980
 And he's like, I have a plan.

42:57.980 --> 42:58.900
 And I'm like, tell me your plan.

42:58.900 --> 43:00.660
 He's like, I can't tell you the plan yet.

43:00.660 --> 43:02.980
 Cause they were deep in negotiations

43:02.980 --> 43:05.500
 between Georgia Tech and Udacity to make this happen.

43:05.500 --> 43:07.340
 And they didn't want it to leak.

43:07.340 --> 43:09.260
 So Charles would kept teasing me about it,

43:09.260 --> 43:10.740
 but wouldn't tell me what was actually going on.

43:10.740 --> 43:13.020
 And eventually it was announced and he said,

43:13.020 --> 43:15.060
 I would like you to teach the machine learning course

43:15.060 --> 43:15.900
 with me.

43:15.900 --> 43:18.340
 I'm like, that can't possibly work.

43:18.340 --> 43:19.340
 But it was a great idea.

43:19.340 --> 43:20.940
 And it was super fun.

43:20.940 --> 43:22.140
 It was a lot of work to put together,

43:22.140 --> 43:23.980
 but it was really great.

43:23.980 --> 43:26.020
 Was that the first time you thought about,

43:26.020 --> 43:27.680
 first of all, was it the first time

43:27.680 --> 43:30.140
 you got seriously into teaching?

43:30.140 --> 43:32.100
 I mean, I was a professor.

43:32.100 --> 43:35.500
 This was already after you jumped to,

43:35.500 --> 43:38.740
 so like there's a little bit of jumping around in time.

43:38.740 --> 43:39.580
 Yeah, sorry about that.

43:39.580 --> 43:40.500
 There's a pretty big jump in time.

43:40.500 --> 43:42.540
 So like the MOOCs thing.

43:42.540 --> 43:44.260
 So Charles got to Georgia Tech and he,

43:44.260 --> 43:46.060
 I mean, maybe Charles, maybe this is a Charles story.

43:46.060 --> 43:47.060
 I got to Georgia Tech in 2002.

43:47.060 --> 43:49.300
 He got to Georgia Tech in 2002.

43:49.300 --> 43:52.820
 And worked on things like revamping the curriculum,

43:52.820 --> 43:53.780
 the undergraduate curriculum,

43:53.780 --> 43:57.800
 so that it had some kind of semblance of modular structure

43:57.800 --> 44:00.060
 because computer science was at the time

44:00.060 --> 44:03.620
 moving from a fairly narrow specific set of topics

44:03.620 --> 44:08.340
 to touching a lot of other parts of intellectual life.

44:08.340 --> 44:10.860
 And the curriculum was supposed to reflect that.

44:10.860 --> 44:15.480
 And so Charles played a big role in kind of redesigning that.

44:15.480 --> 44:16.320
 And then the.

44:16.320 --> 44:20.660
 And for my labors, I ended up as associate dean.

44:20.660 --> 44:22.420
 Right, he got to become associate dean

44:22.420 --> 44:24.780
 of charge of educational stuff.

44:24.780 --> 44:25.620
 Yeah, I was under.

44:25.620 --> 44:26.700
 This should be a valuable lesson.

44:26.700 --> 44:28.940
 If you're good at something,

44:30.260 --> 44:33.740
 they will give you responsibility to do more of that thing.

44:33.740 --> 44:34.580
 Well.

44:34.580 --> 44:35.400
 Until you.

44:35.400 --> 44:36.240
 Don't show competence.

44:36.240 --> 44:37.260
 Don't show competence if you.

44:37.260 --> 44:38.900
 Don't want responsibility.

44:38.900 --> 44:40.700
 Here's what they say.

44:40.700 --> 44:43.340
 The reward for good work is more work.

44:43.340 --> 44:45.340
 The reward for bad work is less work.

44:47.060 --> 44:48.140
 Which, I don't know.

44:48.140 --> 44:50.080
 Depending on what you're trying to do that week,

44:50.080 --> 44:51.300
 one of those is better than the other.

44:51.300 --> 44:52.820
 Well, one of the problems with the word work,

44:52.820 --> 44:57.580
 sorry to interrupt, is that it seems to be an antonym

44:57.580 --> 44:59.240
 in this particular language.

44:59.240 --> 45:01.780
 We have the opposite of happiness.

45:01.780 --> 45:02.980
 But it seems like they're.

45:02.980 --> 45:07.460
 That's one of, you know, we talked about balance.

45:07.460 --> 45:09.700
 It's always like work life balance.

45:09.700 --> 45:12.940
 It always rubbed me the wrong way as a terminology.

45:12.940 --> 45:13.900
 I know it's just words.

45:13.900 --> 45:15.460
 Right, the opposite of work is play.

45:15.460 --> 45:17.900
 But ideally, work is play.

45:17.900 --> 45:20.340
 Oh, I can't tell you how much time I'd spend.

45:20.340 --> 45:21.780
 Certainly, when I was at Bell Labs,

45:21.780 --> 45:23.740
 except for a few very key moments,

45:23.740 --> 45:25.140
 as a professor, I would do this too.

45:25.140 --> 45:26.200
 I would just say, I cannot believe

45:26.200 --> 45:28.700
 they're paying me to do this.

45:28.700 --> 45:29.520
 Because it's fun.

45:29.520 --> 45:32.140
 It's something that I would do for a hobby

45:32.140 --> 45:34.900
 if I could anyway.

45:34.900 --> 45:35.740
 So that sort of worked out.

45:35.740 --> 45:37.020
 Are you sure you want to be saying that

45:37.020 --> 45:38.860
 when this is being recorded?

45:38.860 --> 45:40.220
 As a dean, that is not true at all.

45:40.220 --> 45:41.060
 I need a raise.

45:42.220 --> 45:43.700
 But I think here with this,

45:43.700 --> 45:45.380
 even though a lot of time passed,

45:45.380 --> 45:47.520
 Mike and I talked almost every, well, we texted,

45:47.520 --> 45:49.860
 almost every day during the period.

45:49.860 --> 45:53.060
 Charles, at one point, took me,

45:53.060 --> 45:55.020
 the ICML conference, the machine learning conference

45:55.020 --> 45:57.320
 was in Atlanta.

45:57.320 --> 46:00.380
 I was the chair, the general chair of the conference.

46:00.380 --> 46:03.380
 Charles was my publicity chair or something like that,

46:03.380 --> 46:05.540
 or fundraising chair.

46:05.540 --> 46:08.020
 Yeah, but he decided it'd be really funny

46:08.020 --> 46:09.660
 if he didn't actually show up for the conference

46:09.660 --> 46:11.660
 in his own home city.

46:11.660 --> 46:13.460
 So he didn't, but he did at one point

46:13.460 --> 46:16.200
 pick me up at the conference in his Tesla

46:16.200 --> 46:19.140
 and drove me to the Atlanta mall

46:19.140 --> 46:22.060
 and forced me to buy an iPhone

46:22.060 --> 46:25.660
 because he didn't like how it was to text with me

46:25.660 --> 46:27.220
 and thought it would be better for him

46:27.220 --> 46:30.380
 if I had an iPhone, the text would be somehow smoother.

46:30.380 --> 46:31.220
 And it was.

46:31.220 --> 46:32.060
 And it was.

46:32.060 --> 46:32.880
 And it is, and his life is better.

46:32.880 --> 46:33.720
 And my life is better.

46:33.720 --> 46:36.340
 And so, yeah, but it was, yeah,

46:36.340 --> 46:38.220
 Charles forced me to get an iPhone

46:38.220 --> 46:40.340
 so that he could text me more efficiently.

46:40.340 --> 46:42.020
 I thought that was an interesting moment.

46:42.020 --> 46:42.840
 It works for me.

46:42.840 --> 46:44.100
 Anyway, so we kept talking the whole time

46:44.100 --> 46:46.340
 and then eventually we did the teaching thing

46:46.340 --> 46:47.180
 and it was great.

46:47.180 --> 46:48.780
 And there's a couple of reasons for that, by the way.

46:48.780 --> 46:51.460
 One is I really wanted to do something different.

46:51.460 --> 46:53.200
 Like you've got this medium here,

46:53.200 --> 46:54.500
 people claim it can change things.

46:54.500 --> 46:56.940
 What's a thing that you could do in this medium

46:56.940 --> 47:00.500
 that you could not do otherwise besides edit, right?

47:00.500 --> 47:01.340
 I mean, what could you do?

47:01.340 --> 47:03.940
 And being able to do something with another person

47:03.940 --> 47:04.780
 was that kind of thing.

47:04.780 --> 47:05.600
 It's very hard.

47:05.600 --> 47:06.440
 I mean, you can take turns,

47:06.440 --> 47:09.020
 but teaching together, having conversations is very hard.

47:09.020 --> 47:10.240
 So that was a cool thing.

47:10.240 --> 47:11.340
 The second thing, give me an excuse

47:11.340 --> 47:12.420
 to do more stuff with him.

47:12.420 --> 47:15.700
 Yeah, I always thought, he makes it sound brilliant.

47:15.700 --> 47:17.200
 And it is, I guess.

47:17.200 --> 47:19.220
 But at the time it really felt like

47:20.120 --> 47:22.720
 I've got a lot to do, Charles is saying,

47:22.720 --> 47:25.740
 and it would be great if Michael could teach the course

47:25.740 --> 47:27.700
 and I could just hang out.

47:27.700 --> 47:29.460
 Yeah, just kind of coast on that.

47:29.460 --> 47:31.540
 Well, that's what the second class was more like that.

47:31.540 --> 47:33.380
 Because the second class was explicitly like that.

47:33.380 --> 47:36.280
 But the first class, it was at least half.

47:36.280 --> 47:37.120
 Yeah, but I do all the stuff.

47:37.120 --> 47:37.940
 So the structure that we came up with.

47:37.940 --> 47:39.940
 I think you're once again letting the facts

47:39.940 --> 47:42.900
 get in the way of a good story.

47:42.900 --> 47:44.700
 I should just let Charles talk to us.

47:44.700 --> 47:46.380
 But that's the facts that he saw.

47:46.380 --> 47:48.540
 So that was kind of true for 7642.

47:48.540 --> 47:50.180
 Yeah, that was sort of true for 7642,

47:50.180 --> 47:51.340
 which is the reinforcement learning class,

47:51.340 --> 47:52.540
 because that was really his class.

47:52.540 --> 47:55.260
 You started with reinforcement learning or machine learning?

47:55.260 --> 47:57.420
 Intro machine learning, 7641,

47:57.420 --> 48:00.300
 which is supervised learning, unsupervised learning,

48:00.300 --> 48:02.140
 and reinforcement learning and decision making,

48:02.140 --> 48:03.060
 cram all that in there,

48:03.060 --> 48:04.860
 the kind of assignments that we talked about earlier.

48:04.860 --> 48:06.540
 And then eventually, about a year later,

48:06.540 --> 48:08.540
 we did a follow on 7642,

48:08.540 --> 48:10.860
 which is reinforcement learning and decision making.

48:10.860 --> 48:12.380
 The first class was based on something

48:12.380 --> 48:14.540
 I'd been teaching at that point for well over a decade.

48:14.540 --> 48:15.940
 And the second class was based on something

48:15.940 --> 48:17.500
 Michael had been teaching.

48:17.500 --> 48:18.860
 Actually, I learned quite a bit

48:18.860 --> 48:21.620
 teaching that class with him, but he drove most of that.

48:21.620 --> 48:23.860
 But the first one I drove most, it was all my material.

48:23.860 --> 48:26.340
 Although I had stolen that material originally

48:26.340 --> 48:28.660
 from slides I found online from Michael,

48:28.660 --> 48:30.540
 who had originally stolen that material

48:30.540 --> 48:32.180
 from, I guess, slides he found online,

48:32.180 --> 48:33.220
 probably from Andrew Moore,

48:33.220 --> 48:34.660
 because the jokes were the same anyway.

48:34.660 --> 48:36.660
 At least some of the, at least when I found the slides,

48:36.660 --> 48:37.500
 some of the stuff with it.

48:37.500 --> 48:38.340
 Is that true?

48:38.340 --> 48:40.540
 Yes, every machine learning class taught in the early 2000s

48:40.540 --> 48:41.900
 stole from Andrew Moore.

48:41.900 --> 48:43.980
 A particular joke or two?

48:43.980 --> 48:44.940
 At least the structure.

48:44.940 --> 48:46.620
 Now, I did, and he did, actually,

48:46.620 --> 48:48.940
 a lot more with reinforcement learning and such,

48:48.940 --> 48:50.380
 and game theory and those kinds of things.

48:50.380 --> 48:51.700
 But, you know, we all sort of built in.

48:51.700 --> 48:52.860
 You mean in the research world?

48:52.860 --> 48:54.060
 No, no, no, in that class.

48:54.060 --> 48:54.900
 No, I mean in teaching that class.

48:54.900 --> 48:57.540
 The coverage was different than what we started.

48:57.540 --> 48:58.980
 Most people were just doing supervised learning

48:58.980 --> 49:01.740
 and maybe a little bit of clustering and whatnot,

49:01.740 --> 49:03.060
 but we took it all the way to machine learning.

49:03.060 --> 49:04.820
 A lot of it just comes from Tom Mitchell's book.

49:04.820 --> 49:06.060
 Oh, no, yeah, except, well,

49:06.060 --> 49:07.940
 half of it comes from Tom Mitchell's book, right?

49:07.940 --> 49:10.020
 I mean, the other half doesn't.

49:10.020 --> 49:12.500
 This is why it's all readings, right?

49:12.500 --> 49:13.500
 Because certain things weren't invented

49:13.500 --> 49:14.340
 when Tom wrote that stuff.

49:14.340 --> 49:15.160
 Yeah, okay, that's true.

49:15.160 --> 49:17.660
 All right, but it was quite good.

49:17.660 --> 49:19.920
 But there's a reason for that besides, you know,

49:19.920 --> 49:21.060
 just, I wanted to do it.

49:21.060 --> 49:21.900
 I wanted to do something new,

49:21.900 --> 49:23.380
 and I wanted to do something with him,

49:23.380 --> 49:24.620
 which is a realization,

49:24.620 --> 49:27.380
 which is despite what you might believe,

49:27.380 --> 49:29.460
 he's an introvert and I'm an introvert,

49:29.460 --> 49:32.140
 or I'm on the edge of being an introvert anyway.

49:32.140 --> 49:36.940
 But both of us, I think, enjoy the energy of the crowd,

49:36.940 --> 49:37.780
 right?

49:37.780 --> 49:39.700
 There's something about talking to people

49:39.700 --> 49:41.940
 and bringing them into whatever we find interesting

49:41.940 --> 49:45.440
 that is empowering, energizing, or whatever.

49:45.440 --> 49:50.440
 And I found the idea of staring alone at a computer screen

49:50.440 --> 49:52.720
 and then talking off of materials

49:52.720 --> 49:55.360
 less inspiring than I wanted it to be.

49:55.360 --> 49:59.200
 And I had in fact done a MOOC for Udacity on algorithms.

49:59.200 --> 50:04.200
 And it was a week in a dark room talking at the screen,

50:05.480 --> 50:07.040
 writing on the little pad.

50:07.040 --> 50:09.320
 And I didn't know this was happening,

50:09.320 --> 50:10.160
 but they had watched,

50:10.160 --> 50:12.460
 the crew had watched some of the videos

50:12.460 --> 50:13.720
 while, you know, like in the middle of this,

50:13.720 --> 50:15.800
 and they're like, something's wrong.

50:15.800 --> 50:19.540
 You're sort of shutting down.

50:19.540 --> 50:22.440
 And I think a lot of it was I'll make jokes

50:22.440 --> 50:24.220
 and no one would laugh.

50:24.220 --> 50:26.480
 And I felt like the crowd hated me.

50:26.480 --> 50:27.800
 Now, of course, there was no crowd.

50:27.800 --> 50:29.960
 So like, it wasn't rational.

50:29.960 --> 50:32.900
 But each time I tried it and I got no reaction,

50:32.900 --> 50:37.280
 it just was taking the energy out of my performance,

50:37.280 --> 50:38.720
 out of my presentation.

50:38.720 --> 50:40.360
 Such a fantastic metaphor for grad school.

50:40.360 --> 50:42.600
 Anyway, by working together,

50:42.600 --> 50:44.600
 we could play off each other and have a good time.

50:44.600 --> 50:45.420
 And keep the energy up,

50:45.420 --> 50:48.480
 because you can't let your guard down for a moment

50:48.480 --> 50:51.080
 with Charles, he'll just overpower you.

50:51.080 --> 50:52.200
 I have no idea what you're talking about.

50:52.200 --> 50:54.040
 But we would work really well together, I thought,

50:54.040 --> 50:54.880
 and we knew each other,

50:54.880 --> 50:56.640
 so I knew that we could sort of make it work.

50:56.640 --> 50:57.720
 Plus, I was the associate dean,

50:57.720 --> 51:00.080
 so they had to do what I told them to do.

51:00.080 --> 51:01.480
 We had to make it work.

51:01.480 --> 51:03.880
 And so it worked out very well, I thought,

51:03.880 --> 51:04.920
 well enough that we.

51:04.920 --> 51:06.560
 With great power comes great power.

51:06.560 --> 51:07.380
 That's right.

51:07.380 --> 51:09.320
 And we became smooth and curly.

51:09.320 --> 51:14.320
 And that's when we did the overfitting thriller video.

51:15.680 --> 51:17.400
 Yeah, that's a thing.

51:17.400 --> 51:20.880
 So can we just, like, smooth and curly,

51:20.880 --> 51:21.720
 where did that come from?

51:21.720 --> 51:23.440
 Okay, so it happened.

51:23.440 --> 51:24.680
 It was completely spontaneous.

51:24.680 --> 51:25.880
 These are nicknames you go by.

51:25.880 --> 51:28.600
 Yeah, so it's what the students call us.

51:28.600 --> 51:30.300
 He was lecturing.

51:30.300 --> 51:32.040
 So the way that we structured the lectures

51:32.040 --> 51:33.400
 is one of us is the lecturer

51:33.400 --> 51:35.360
 and one of us is basically the student.

51:35.360 --> 51:37.440
 And so he was lecturing on.

51:37.440 --> 51:39.040
 The lecturer prepares all the materials,

51:39.040 --> 51:40.440
 comes up with the quizzes,

51:40.440 --> 51:43.120
 and then the student comes in not knowing anything.

51:43.120 --> 51:45.440
 So it was just like being on campus.

51:45.440 --> 51:48.080
 And I was doing game theory in particular,

51:48.080 --> 51:48.900
 the Prisoner's Dilemma.

51:48.900 --> 51:49.740
 Prisoner's Dilemma.

51:49.740 --> 51:52.200
 And so he needed to set up a little Prisoner's Dilemma grid.

51:52.200 --> 51:54.320
 So he drew it and I could see what he was drawing.

51:54.320 --> 51:57.520
 And the Prisoner's Dilemma consists of two players,

51:57.520 --> 51:58.360
 two parties.

51:58.360 --> 52:00.120
 So he decided he would make little cartoons

52:00.120 --> 52:01.240
 of the two of us.

52:01.240 --> 52:04.860
 And so there was two criminals, right,

52:04.860 --> 52:07.960
 that were deciding whether or not to rat each other out.

52:07.960 --> 52:11.120
 One of them he drew as a circle with a smiley face

52:11.120 --> 52:14.080
 and a kind of goatee thing, smooth head.

52:14.080 --> 52:16.320
 And the other one with all sorts of curly hair.

52:16.320 --> 52:18.400
 And he said, this is smooth and curly.

52:18.400 --> 52:19.680
 I said, smooth and curly?

52:19.680 --> 52:21.560
 He said, no, no, smooth with a V.

52:21.560 --> 52:23.600
 It's very important that it have a V.

52:23.600 --> 52:27.220
 And then the students really took to that.

52:27.220 --> 52:29.160
 Like they found that relatable.

52:29.160 --> 52:31.200
 He started singing Smooth Criminal by Michael Jackson.

52:31.200 --> 52:32.040
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:32.040 --> 52:33.560
 And those names stuck.

52:33.560 --> 52:36.320
 So we now have a video series,

52:36.320 --> 52:38.440
 an episode, our kind of first actual episode

52:38.440 --> 52:39.900
 should be coming out today,

52:39.900 --> 52:43.260
 Smooth and Curly on video,

52:43.260 --> 52:47.300
 where the two of us discuss episodes of Westworld.

52:47.300 --> 52:49.360
 We watch Westworld and we're like, huh,

52:49.360 --> 52:51.900
 what does this say about computer science and AI?

52:51.900 --> 52:53.940
 And we've never, we did not watch it.

52:53.940 --> 52:55.760
 I mean, no, it's on season three or whatever we have.

52:55.760 --> 52:57.660
 As of this recording, it's on season three.

52:57.660 --> 52:59.960
 We've watched now two episodes total.

52:59.960 --> 53:01.460
 Yeah, I think I watched three.

53:01.460 --> 53:02.660
 What do you think about Westworld?

53:02.660 --> 53:03.500
 Two episodes in.

53:03.500 --> 53:05.940
 So I can tell you so far,

53:05.940 --> 53:08.160
 I'm just guessing what's gonna happen next.

53:08.160 --> 53:10.180
 It seems like bad things are gonna happen

53:10.180 --> 53:11.260
 with the robots uprising.

53:11.260 --> 53:12.100
 It's a lot of.

53:12.100 --> 53:12.940
 Spoiler alert.

53:12.940 --> 53:13.780
 So I have not, I have not,

53:13.780 --> 53:16.200
 I mean, you know, I vaguely remember a movie existing.

53:16.200 --> 53:18.600
 So I assume it's related to that, but.

53:18.600 --> 53:20.220
 That was more my time than your time, Charles.

53:20.220 --> 53:21.540
 That's right, cause you're much older than I am.

53:21.540 --> 53:24.180
 I think the important thing here is that

53:24.180 --> 53:25.060
 it's narrative, right?

53:25.060 --> 53:26.100
 It's all about telling a story.

53:26.100 --> 53:27.500
 That's the whole driving thing.

53:27.500 --> 53:29.720
 But the idea that they would give these reveries,

53:29.720 --> 53:31.420
 that they would make people,

53:31.420 --> 53:32.260
 they would make them.

53:32.260 --> 53:33.080
 Let them remember.

53:33.080 --> 53:33.920
 Remember the awful things that happened.

53:33.920 --> 53:35.460
 The terrible things that happened.

53:35.460 --> 53:36.860
 Who could possibly think that was gonna,

53:36.860 --> 53:38.380
 I gotta, I mean, I don't know.

53:38.380 --> 53:39.660
 I've only seen the first two episodes

53:39.660 --> 53:40.500
 or maybe the third one.

53:40.500 --> 53:41.320
 I think I've only seen the first one.

53:41.320 --> 53:42.160
 You know what it was?

53:42.160 --> 53:43.000
 You know what the problem is?

53:43.000 --> 53:45.520
 That the robots were actually designed by Hannibal Lecter.

53:45.520 --> 53:46.360
 That's true.

53:46.360 --> 53:47.200
 They weren't.

53:47.200 --> 53:49.580
 So like, what do you think is gonna happen?

53:49.580 --> 53:50.500
 Bad things.

53:50.500 --> 53:51.840
 It's clear that things are happening

53:51.840 --> 53:52.960
 and characters are being introduced

53:52.960 --> 53:54.260
 and we don't yet know anything,

53:54.260 --> 53:57.020
 but still I was just struck by how

53:57.020 --> 53:58.580
 it's all driven by narrative and story.

53:58.580 --> 54:01.260
 And there's all these implied things like programming,

54:01.260 --> 54:03.880
 the programming interface is talking to them

54:03.880 --> 54:05.640
 about what's going on in their heads,

54:05.640 --> 54:08.560
 which is both, I mean, artistically,

54:08.560 --> 54:10.120
 it's probably useful to film it that way.

54:10.120 --> 54:11.540
 But think about how it would work in real life.

54:11.540 --> 54:12.480
 That just seems very great.

54:12.480 --> 54:14.280
 But there was, we saw in the second episode,

54:14.280 --> 54:15.120
 there's a screen.

54:15.120 --> 54:15.940
 You could see things.

54:15.940 --> 54:16.780
 They were wearing like Kubrick's glasses.

54:16.780 --> 54:17.620
 In the world.

54:17.620 --> 54:20.360
 It was quite interesting to just kind of ask this question

54:20.360 --> 54:21.200
 so far.

54:21.200 --> 54:22.940
 I mean, I assume it veers off into Never Never Land

54:22.940 --> 54:23.780
 at some point.

54:23.780 --> 54:24.940
 So we don't know.

54:24.940 --> 54:25.880
 We can't answer that question.

54:25.880 --> 54:28.680
 I'm also a fan of a guy named Alex Garland.

54:28.680 --> 54:30.440
 He's a director of Ex Machina.

54:30.440 --> 54:31.280
 Mm hmm.

54:31.280 --> 54:33.980
 And he is the first,

54:33.980 --> 54:36.100
 I wonder if Kubrick was like this actually,

54:36.100 --> 54:39.260
 is he like studies,

54:39.260 --> 54:41.720
 what would it take to program an AI systems?

54:41.720 --> 54:44.720
 Like he's curious enough to go into that direction.

54:44.720 --> 54:46.420
 On the Westworld side,

54:46.420 --> 54:49.300
 I felt there was more emphasis on the narratives

54:49.300 --> 54:52.360
 than like actually asking like computer science questions.

54:52.360 --> 54:53.200
 Yeah.

54:53.200 --> 54:54.620
 Like, how would you build this?

54:54.620 --> 54:56.940
 How would you, and.

54:56.940 --> 54:57.780
 How would you debug it?

54:57.780 --> 55:00.960
 I still think, to me, that's the key issue.

55:00.960 --> 55:02.280
 They were terrible debuggers.

55:02.280 --> 55:03.120
 Yeah.

55:03.120 --> 55:04.240
 Well, they said specifically,

55:04.240 --> 55:05.880
 so we make a change and we put it out in the world

55:05.880 --> 55:07.800
 and that's bad because something terrible could happen.

55:07.800 --> 55:09.560
 Like if you're putting things out in the world

55:09.560 --> 55:11.100
 and you're not sure whether something terrible

55:11.100 --> 55:13.240
 is going to happen, your process is probably.

55:13.240 --> 55:14.760
 I just feel like there should have been someone

55:14.760 --> 55:17.320
 whose sole job it was to walk around and poke his head in

55:17.320 --> 55:19.160
 and say, what could possibly go wrong?

55:19.160 --> 55:20.660
 Just over and over again.

55:20.660 --> 55:22.080
 I would have loved if there was an,

55:22.080 --> 55:24.800
 and I did watch a lot more and I'm not giving anything away.

55:24.800 --> 55:27.080
 I would have loved it if there was like an episode

55:27.080 --> 55:29.960
 where like the new intern is like debugging

55:29.960 --> 55:32.720
 a new model or something and like it just keeps failing

55:32.720 --> 55:34.160
 and they're like, all right.

55:34.160 --> 55:36.840
 And then it's more turns into like a episode

55:36.840 --> 55:38.320
 of Silicon Valley or something like that.

55:38.320 --> 55:39.320
 Yes.

55:39.320 --> 55:41.960
 Versus like this ominous AI systems

55:41.960 --> 55:45.640
 that are constantly like threatening the fabric

55:45.640 --> 55:47.320
 of this world that's been created.

55:47.320 --> 55:48.160
 Yeah.

55:48.160 --> 55:49.360
 Yeah, and you know the other,

55:49.360 --> 55:51.160
 this reminds me of something that,

55:51.160 --> 55:52.600
 so I agree that that should be very cool,

55:52.600 --> 55:54.760
 at least for the small percentage of people

55:54.760 --> 55:56.680
 who care about debugging systems.

55:56.680 --> 55:57.520
 But the other thing is.

55:57.520 --> 55:59.000
 Right, debugging, the series.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.400
 Yeah, it falls into, think of the sequels,

56:01.400 --> 56:02.240
 fear of the debugger.

56:02.240 --> 56:03.400
 Oh my gosh.

56:03.400 --> 56:04.240
 Anyway, so.

56:04.240 --> 56:07.400
 It's a nightmare show, it's a horror movie.

56:07.400 --> 56:08.880
 I think that's where we lose people, by the way,

56:08.880 --> 56:10.660
 early on is the people who either decide,

56:10.660 --> 56:12.800
 either figure out debugging or think debugging is terrible.

56:12.800 --> 56:14.800
 This is where we lose people in computer science.

56:14.800 --> 56:17.000
 This is a part of the struggle versus suffering, right?

56:17.000 --> 56:19.560
 You get through it and you kind of get the skills of it,

56:19.560 --> 56:20.880
 or you're just like, this is dumb,

56:20.880 --> 56:22.040
 and this is a dumb way to do anything.

56:22.040 --> 56:23.480
 And I think that's when we lose people.

56:23.480 --> 56:26.680
 But, well, I'll leave it at that.

56:26.680 --> 56:33.040
 But I think that there's something really, really neat

56:33.040 --> 56:34.160
 about framing it that way.

56:34.160 --> 56:37.600
 But what I don't like about all of these things,

56:37.600 --> 56:39.000
 and I love Tex Machina, by the way,

56:39.000 --> 56:41.300
 although the ending was very depressing.

56:42.940 --> 56:46.320
 One of the things I have to talk to Alex about,

56:46.320 --> 56:49.920
 he says that the thing that nobody noticed he put in

56:49.920 --> 56:53.880
 is at the end, spoiler alert,

56:53.880 --> 57:00.160
 the robot turns and looks at the camera and smiles, briefly.

57:00.160 --> 57:04.680
 And to him, he thought that his definition

57:04.680 --> 57:08.480
 of passing the general version of the Turing test,

57:08.480 --> 57:12.420
 or the consciousness test, is smiling for no one.

57:17.960 --> 57:20.520
 It's like the Chinese room kind of experiment.

57:20.520 --> 57:22.760
 It's not always trying to act for others,

57:22.760 --> 57:26.280
 but just on your own, being able to have a relationship

57:26.280 --> 57:29.840
 with the actual experience and just take it in.

57:29.840 --> 57:32.720
 I don't know, he said nobody noticed the magic of it.

57:32.720 --> 57:35.000
 I have this vague feeling that I remember the smile,

57:35.000 --> 57:37.080
 but now you've just put the memory in my head,

57:37.080 --> 57:38.120
 so probably not.

57:38.120 --> 57:40.120
 But I do think that that's interesting.

57:40.120 --> 57:41.920
 Although, by looking at the camera,

57:41.920 --> 57:43.600
 you are smiling for the audience, right?

57:43.600 --> 57:44.920
 You're breaking the fourth wall.

57:44.920 --> 57:48.160
 It seems, I mean, well, that's a limitation of the medium.

57:48.160 --> 57:49.600
 But I like that idea.

57:49.600 --> 57:51.480
 But here's the problem I have with all of those movies,

57:51.480 --> 57:54.720
 all of them, is that, but I know why it's this way,

57:54.720 --> 57:57.480
 and I enjoy those movies, and Westworld,

57:57.480 --> 58:02.480
 is it sets up the problem of AI as succeeding

58:02.960 --> 58:05.400
 and then having something we cannot control.

58:05.400 --> 58:08.400
 But it's not the bad part of AI.

58:08.400 --> 58:10.020
 The bad part of AI is the stuff

58:10.020 --> 58:11.120
 we're living through now, right?

58:11.120 --> 58:13.740
 It's using the data to make decisions that are terrible.

58:13.740 --> 58:15.840
 It's not the intelligence that's gonna go out there

58:15.840 --> 58:17.960
 and surpass us and take over the world

58:17.960 --> 58:21.640
 or lock us into a room to starve to death slowly

58:21.640 --> 58:22.680
 over multiple days.

58:22.680 --> 58:26.140
 It's instead the tools that we're building

58:26.140 --> 58:30.320
 that are allowing us to make the terrible decisions

58:30.320 --> 58:32.960
 we would have less efficiently made before, right?

58:32.960 --> 58:35.680
 Computers are very good at making us more efficient,

58:35.680 --> 58:38.160
 including being more efficient at doing terrible things.

58:38.160 --> 58:40.220
 And that's the part of the AI we have to worry about.

58:40.220 --> 58:44.040
 It's not the true intelligence that we're gonna build

58:44.040 --> 58:48.080
 sometime in the future, probably long after we're around.

58:48.080 --> 58:52.120
 But I think that whole framing of it

58:52.120 --> 58:55.960
 sort of misses the point, even though it is inspiring.

58:55.960 --> 58:57.760
 And I was inspired by those ideas, right?

58:57.760 --> 58:59.040
 I got into this in part

58:59.040 --> 59:00.800
 because I wanted to build something like that.

59:00.800 --> 59:02.800
 Philosophical questions are interesting to me,

59:02.800 --> 59:04.760
 but that's not where the terror comes from.

59:04.760 --> 59:06.160
 The terror comes from the everyday.

59:06.160 --> 59:08.320
 And you can construct situations

59:08.320 --> 59:11.720
 in the subtlety of the interaction between AI and the human,

59:11.720 --> 59:14.120
 like with social networks,

59:14.120 --> 59:15.160
 all the stuff you're doing

59:15.160 --> 59:17.800
 with interactive artificial intelligence.

59:17.800 --> 59:22.600
 But I feel like Cal 9000 came a little bit closer to that

59:22.600 --> 59:24.400
 in 2001 Space Odyssey,

59:24.400 --> 59:29.000
 because it felt like a personal assistant.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.360
 It felt like closer to the AI systems we have today.

59:31.360 --> 59:35.880
 And the real things we might actually encounter,

59:35.880 --> 59:40.880
 which is over relying in some fundamental way

59:40.880 --> 59:44.860
 on our dumb assistants or on social networks,

59:44.860 --> 59:47.220
 like over offloading too much of us

59:47.220 --> 59:52.220
 onto things that require internet and power and so on

59:55.100 --> 59:59.580
 and thereby becoming powerless as a standalone entity.

59:59.580 --> 1:00:02.300
 And then when that thing starts to misbehave

1:00:02.300 --> 1:00:05.620
 in some subtle way, it creates a lot of problems.

1:00:05.620 --> 1:00:08.460
 And those problems are dramatized when you're in space,

1:00:08.460 --> 1:00:11.340
 because you don't have a way to walk away.

1:00:11.340 --> 1:00:12.820
 Well, as the man said,

1:00:12.820 --> 1:00:15.300
 once we started making the decisions for you,

1:00:15.300 --> 1:00:17.220
 it stopped being your world, right?

1:00:17.220 --> 1:00:20.420
 That's the matrix, Michael, in case you don't remember.

1:00:20.420 --> 1:00:23.180
 But on the other hand, I could say no,

1:00:23.180 --> 1:00:25.620
 because isn't that what we do with people anyway?

1:00:25.620 --> 1:00:27.120
 You know, just kind of the shared intelligence

1:00:27.120 --> 1:00:30.220
 that is humanity is relying on other people constantly.

1:00:30.220 --> 1:00:32.340
 I mean, we hyper specialize, right?

1:00:32.340 --> 1:00:34.620
 As individuals, we're still generally intelligent.

1:00:34.620 --> 1:00:36.040
 We make our own decisions in a lot of ways,

1:00:36.040 --> 1:00:37.620
 but we leave most of this up to other people.

1:00:37.620 --> 1:00:39.860
 And that's perfectly fine.

1:00:39.860 --> 1:00:43.220
 And by the way, everyone doesn't necessarily share our goals.

1:00:43.220 --> 1:00:45.100
 Sometimes they seem to be quite against us.

1:00:45.100 --> 1:00:47.900
 Sometimes we make decisions that others would see

1:00:47.900 --> 1:00:49.080
 as against our own interests.

1:00:49.080 --> 1:00:51.340
 And yet we somehow manage it, manage to survive.

1:00:51.340 --> 1:00:54.240
 I'm not entirely sure why an AI

1:00:54.240 --> 1:00:59.240
 would actually make that worse or even different, really.

1:01:00.260 --> 1:01:02.140
 You mentioned the matrix.

1:01:02.140 --> 1:01:04.420
 Do you think we're living in a simulation?

1:01:04.420 --> 1:01:08.060
 It does feel like a thought game

1:01:08.060 --> 1:01:10.740
 more than a real scientific question.

1:01:10.740 --> 1:01:12.140
 Well, I'll tell you why I think

1:01:12.140 --> 1:01:13.500
 it's an interesting thought experiment.

1:01:13.500 --> 1:01:14.340
 Let's see what you think.

1:01:14.340 --> 1:01:16.140
 From a computer science perspective,

1:01:16.140 --> 1:01:20.180
 it's a good experiment of how difficult would it be

1:01:20.180 --> 1:01:22.860
 to create a sufficiently realistic world

1:01:22.860 --> 1:01:25.000
 that us humans would enjoy being in.

1:01:26.700 --> 1:01:27.660
 That's almost like a competition.

1:01:27.660 --> 1:01:29.100
 If we're living in a simulation,

1:01:29.100 --> 1:01:31.600
 then I don't believe that we were put in the simulation.

1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:34.180
 I believe that it's just physics playing out

1:01:34.180 --> 1:01:36.400
 and we came out of that.

1:01:36.400 --> 1:01:39.220
 Like, I don't think.

1:01:39.220 --> 1:01:40.900
 So you think you have to build the universe

1:01:40.900 --> 1:01:41.740
 and have all the fun in the world?

1:01:41.740 --> 1:01:42.560
 I think that the universe itself,

1:01:42.560 --> 1:01:43.820
 we can think of that as a simulation.

1:01:43.820 --> 1:01:46.820
 And in fact, sometimes I try to think about,

1:01:46.820 --> 1:01:49.560
 to understand what it's like for a computer

1:01:49.560 --> 1:01:52.660
 to start to think about the world.

1:01:52.660 --> 1:01:55.060
 I try to think about the world.

1:01:55.060 --> 1:01:56.780
 Things like quantum mechanics,

1:01:56.780 --> 1:01:59.940
 where it doesn't feel very natural to me at all.

1:01:59.940 --> 1:02:02.840
 And it really strikes me as,

1:02:02.840 --> 1:02:05.220
 I don't understand this thing that we're living in.

1:02:05.220 --> 1:02:07.620
 It has, there's weird things happening in it

1:02:07.620 --> 1:02:09.660
 that don't feel natural to me at all.

1:02:09.660 --> 1:02:13.060
 Now, if you want to call that as the result of a simulator,

1:02:13.060 --> 1:02:14.280
 okay, I'm fine with that.

1:02:14.280 --> 1:02:15.120
 But like, I don't.

1:02:15.120 --> 1:02:16.940
 There's the bugs in the simulation.

1:02:16.940 --> 1:02:17.780
 There's the bugs.

1:02:17.780 --> 1:02:19.540
 I mean, the interesting thing about the simulation

1:02:19.540 --> 1:02:21.260
 is that it might have bugs.

1:02:21.260 --> 1:02:23.060
 I mean, that's the thing that I,

1:02:23.060 --> 1:02:25.540
 But there would be bugs for the people in the simulation.

1:02:25.540 --> 1:02:27.100
 That's just reality.

1:02:27.100 --> 1:02:29.300
 Unless you were aware enough to know that there was a bug.

1:02:29.300 --> 1:02:30.300
 But I think.

1:02:30.300 --> 1:02:31.420
 Back to the matrix.

1:02:31.420 --> 1:02:32.260
 Yeah, the way you put the question though.

1:02:32.260 --> 1:02:35.300
 I don't think that we live in a simulation created for us.

1:02:35.300 --> 1:02:36.340
 Okay, I would say that.

1:02:36.340 --> 1:02:37.180
 I think that's interesting.

1:02:37.180 --> 1:02:38.100
 I've actually never thought about it that way.

1:02:38.100 --> 1:02:40.140
 I mean, the way you asked the question though,

1:02:40.140 --> 1:02:43.020
 could you create a world that is enough for us humans?

1:02:43.020 --> 1:02:45.460
 It's an interestingly sort of self referential question

1:02:45.460 --> 1:02:49.920
 because the beings that created the simulation

1:02:49.920 --> 1:02:51.460
 probably have not created the simulation

1:02:51.460 --> 1:02:53.300
 that's realistic for them.

1:02:53.300 --> 1:02:56.180
 But we're in the simulation and so it's realistic for us.

1:02:56.180 --> 1:02:58.220
 So we could create a simulation

1:02:58.220 --> 1:03:02.140
 that is fine for the people in the simulation, as it were.

1:03:02.140 --> 1:03:03.660
 That would not necessarily be fine for us

1:03:03.660 --> 1:03:05.140
 as the creators of the simulation.

1:03:05.140 --> 1:03:07.460
 But, well, you can forget.

1:03:07.460 --> 1:03:11.320
 I mean, if you play video games in virtual reality,

1:03:11.320 --> 1:03:15.460
 you can, if some suspension of disbelief or whatever.

1:03:16.340 --> 1:03:17.420
 It becomes a world.

1:03:17.420 --> 1:03:18.500
 It becomes a world.

1:03:18.500 --> 1:03:20.100
 Even like in brief moments,

1:03:20.100 --> 1:03:22.300
 you forget that another world exists.

1:03:22.300 --> 1:03:24.220
 I mean, that's what like good stories do.

1:03:24.220 --> 1:03:25.060
 They pull you in.

1:03:25.060 --> 1:03:28.440
 And the question is, is it possible to pull,

1:03:28.440 --> 1:03:29.380
 our brains are limited.

1:03:29.380 --> 1:03:31.280
 Is it possible to pull the brain in

1:03:31.280 --> 1:03:32.700
 to where we actually stay in that world

1:03:32.700 --> 1:03:34.780
 longer and longer and longer and longer?

1:03:34.780 --> 1:03:39.000
 And like, not only that, but we don't wanna leave.

1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:41.500
 And so, especially this is the key thing

1:03:41.500 --> 1:03:43.860
 about the developing brain,

1:03:43.860 --> 1:03:48.140
 is if we journey into that world early on in life, often.

1:03:48.140 --> 1:03:49.740
 How would you even know, yeah.

1:03:49.740 --> 1:03:53.200
 Yeah, so I, but like from a video game design perspective,

1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:54.420
 from a Westworld perspective,

1:03:54.420 --> 1:03:57.540
 it's, I think it's an important thing

1:03:57.540 --> 1:04:00.820
 for even computer scientists to think about

1:04:00.820 --> 1:04:04.580
 because it's clear that video games are getting much better.

1:04:04.580 --> 1:04:06.500
 And virtual reality,

1:04:06.500 --> 1:04:08.460
 although it's been ups and downs

1:04:08.460 --> 1:04:09.860
 just like artificial intelligence,

1:04:09.860 --> 1:04:14.780
 it feels like virtual reality will be here

1:04:14.780 --> 1:04:16.340
 in a very impressive form

1:04:16.340 --> 1:04:19.060
 if we were to fast forward 100 years into the future

1:04:19.060 --> 1:04:22.100
 in a way that might change society fundamentally.

1:04:22.100 --> 1:04:23.180
 Like if I were to,

1:04:23.180 --> 1:04:26.540
 I'm very limited in predicting the future as all of us are,

1:04:26.540 --> 1:04:28.620
 but if I were to try to predict,

1:04:28.620 --> 1:04:32.540
 like in which way I'd be surprised

1:04:32.540 --> 1:04:35.780
 to see the world 100 years from now,

1:04:35.780 --> 1:04:39.540
 it'd be that, or impressed,

1:04:39.540 --> 1:04:42.280
 it'd be that we're all no longer living

1:04:42.280 --> 1:04:43.340
 in this physical world,

1:04:43.340 --> 1:04:45.020
 that we're all living in a virtual world.

1:04:45.020 --> 1:04:49.040
 You really need to read Calculating God by Sawyer.

1:04:51.140 --> 1:04:53.080
 It's a, he'll read it in the night.

1:04:53.080 --> 1:04:54.300
 It's a very easy read,

1:04:54.300 --> 1:04:56.180
 but it's, assuming you're that kind of reader,

1:04:56.180 --> 1:04:58.380
 but it's a good story.

1:04:58.380 --> 1:04:59.680
 And it's kind of about this,

1:04:59.680 --> 1:05:01.420
 but not in a way that it appears.

1:05:01.420 --> 1:05:05.860
 And I really enjoyed the thought experiment.

1:05:07.020 --> 1:05:08.260
 And I think it's pretty sure it's Robert Sawyer.

1:05:08.260 --> 1:05:10.140
 But anyway, he's apparently

1:05:10.140 --> 1:05:12.420
 Canadian's top science fiction writer,

1:05:12.420 --> 1:05:14.980
 which is why the story mostly takes place in Toronto.

1:05:14.980 --> 1:05:18.520
 But it's a very good sort of story

1:05:18.520 --> 1:05:21.260
 that sort of imagines this.

1:05:21.260 --> 1:05:25.020
 Very different kind of simulation hypothesis sort of thing

1:05:25.020 --> 1:05:28.340
 from say, The Egg, for example.

1:05:28.340 --> 1:05:30.540
 You know, I'm talking about the short story.

1:05:32.140 --> 1:05:33.740
 By the guy who did The Martian.

1:05:34.900 --> 1:05:36.300
 Who wrote The Martian?

1:05:36.300 --> 1:05:37.140
 You know what I'm talking about.

1:05:37.140 --> 1:05:38.980
 The Martian. Matt Damon.

1:05:38.980 --> 1:05:39.820
 The book.

1:05:39.820 --> 1:05:41.500
 So we had this whole discussion

1:05:41.500 --> 1:05:45.740
 that Michael doesn't partake in this exercise of reading.

1:05:45.740 --> 1:05:46.780
 He doesn't seem to like it,

1:05:46.780 --> 1:05:48.120
 which seems very strange to me,

1:05:48.120 --> 1:05:50.020
 considering how much he has to read.

1:05:50.020 --> 1:05:50.980
 I read all the time.

1:05:50.980 --> 1:05:53.340
 I used to read 10 books every week

1:05:53.340 --> 1:05:55.260
 when I was in sixth grade or whatever.

1:05:55.260 --> 1:05:57.040
 I was, a lot of it's science fiction,

1:05:57.040 --> 1:05:59.940
 a lot of it's history, but I love to read.

1:05:59.940 --> 1:06:01.740
 But anyway, you should read Calculating God.

1:06:01.740 --> 1:06:04.980
 I think you'll, it's very easy to read, like I said,

1:06:04.980 --> 1:06:08.660
 and I think you'll enjoy sort of the ideas that it presents.

1:06:08.660 --> 1:06:11.500
 Yeah, I think the thought experiment is quite interesting.

1:06:12.740 --> 1:06:15.660
 One thing I've noticed about people growing up now,

1:06:15.660 --> 1:06:17.240
 I mean, we talk about social media,

1:06:17.240 --> 1:06:19.580
 but video games is a much bigger,

1:06:19.580 --> 1:06:21.700
 bigger and bigger and bigger part of their lives.

1:06:21.700 --> 1:06:24.180
 And the video games have become much more realistic.

1:06:24.180 --> 1:06:29.180
 I think it's possible that the three of us are not,

1:06:31.380 --> 1:06:33.420
 maybe the two of you are not familiar exactly

1:06:33.420 --> 1:06:36.060
 with the numbers we're talking about here.

1:06:36.060 --> 1:06:37.140
 The number of people.

1:06:37.140 --> 1:06:38.460
 It's bigger than movies, right?

1:06:38.460 --> 1:06:39.900
 It's huge.

1:06:39.900 --> 1:06:42.900
 I used to do a lot of the computational narrative stuff.

1:06:42.900 --> 1:06:45.660
 I understand that economists can actually see

1:06:45.660 --> 1:06:48.700
 the impact of video games on the labor market.

1:06:48.700 --> 1:06:53.700
 That there's fewer young men of a certain age

1:06:54.460 --> 1:06:59.260
 participating in like paying jobs than you'd expect.

1:06:59.260 --> 1:07:01.300
 And that they trace it back to video games.

1:07:01.300 --> 1:07:02.900
 I mean, the problem with Star Trek

1:07:02.900 --> 1:07:06.320
 was not warp drive or teleportation.

1:07:06.320 --> 1:07:07.980
 It was the holodeck.

1:07:07.980 --> 1:07:12.020
 Like if you have the holodeck, that's it.

1:07:12.020 --> 1:07:13.580
 That's it, you go in the holodeck, you never come out.

1:07:13.580 --> 1:07:16.860
 I mean, it just never made, once I saw that,

1:07:16.860 --> 1:07:19.260
 I thought, okay, well, so this is the end of humanity

1:07:19.260 --> 1:07:20.100
 as we know it, right?

1:07:20.100 --> 1:07:21.700
 They've invented the holodeck.

1:07:21.700 --> 1:07:23.140
 Because that feels like the singularity,

1:07:23.140 --> 1:07:25.020
 not some AGI or whatever.

1:07:25.020 --> 1:07:28.140
 It's some possibility to go into another world

1:07:28.140 --> 1:07:31.020
 that can be artificially made better than this one.

1:07:32.380 --> 1:07:34.140
 And slowing it down so you live forever.

1:07:34.140 --> 1:07:35.700
 Or speeding it up so you appear to live forever.

1:07:35.700 --> 1:07:37.980
 Or making the decision of when to die.

1:07:39.020 --> 1:07:42.300
 And then most of us will just be old people on the porch

1:07:42.300 --> 1:07:47.300
 yelling at the kids these days in their virtual reality.

1:07:47.300 --> 1:07:49.860
 But they won't hear us because they've got headphones on.

1:07:49.860 --> 1:07:53.540
 So, I mean, rewinding back to Mook's,

1:07:53.540 --> 1:07:57.420
 is there lessons that you've, speaking to kids these days?

1:07:58.660 --> 1:07:59.500
 That was a transition.

1:07:59.500 --> 1:08:01.860
 That was fantastic.

1:08:01.860 --> 1:08:03.240
 I'll fix it in post.

1:08:04.620 --> 1:08:06.400
 That's Charles's favorite phrase.

1:08:06.400 --> 1:08:07.240
 Fix it in post?

1:08:07.240 --> 1:08:08.060
 Fix it in post.

1:08:08.060 --> 1:08:08.900
 Fix it in post.

1:08:08.900 --> 1:08:10.600
 When we were recording all the time,

1:08:10.600 --> 1:08:12.900
 whenever the editor didn't like something or whatever,

1:08:12.900 --> 1:08:14.420
 I would say, we'll fix it in post.

1:08:14.420 --> 1:08:15.860
 He hated that.

1:08:15.860 --> 1:08:16.860
 He hated that more than anything.

1:08:16.860 --> 1:08:17.980
 Because it's Charles's way of saying,

1:08:17.980 --> 1:08:19.380
 I'm not gonna do it again.

1:08:20.700 --> 1:08:22.300
 You're on your own for this one.

1:08:22.300 --> 1:08:24.060
 But it always got fixed in post.

1:08:24.060 --> 1:08:24.880
 Exactly right.

1:08:24.880 --> 1:08:28.340
 So is there something you've learned about,

1:08:28.340 --> 1:08:29.820
 I mean, it's interesting to talk about Mook's.

1:08:29.820 --> 1:08:30.700
 Is there something you've learned

1:08:30.700 --> 1:08:32.140
 about the process of education,

1:08:32.140 --> 1:08:35.820
 about thinking about the present?

1:08:35.820 --> 1:08:38.780
 I think there's two lines of conversation to be had here.

1:08:38.780 --> 1:08:41.540
 There's the future of education in general

1:08:41.540 --> 1:08:42.820
 that you've learned about.

1:08:42.820 --> 1:08:47.820
 And more passionately is the education

1:08:49.060 --> 1:08:50.420
 in the times of COVID.

1:08:50.420 --> 1:08:51.260
 Yeah.

1:08:51.260 --> 1:08:54.020
 The second thing in some ways matters more than the first,

1:08:54.020 --> 1:08:55.860
 for at least in my head,

1:08:55.860 --> 1:08:57.060
 not just because it's happening now,

1:08:57.060 --> 1:09:00.620
 but because I think it's reminded us of a lot of things.

1:09:00.620 --> 1:09:02.920
 Coincidentally, today, there's an article out

1:09:02.920 --> 1:09:04.560
 by a good friend of mine,

1:09:04.560 --> 1:09:06.120
 who's also a professor at Georgia Tech,

1:09:06.120 --> 1:09:07.900
 but more importantly, a writer and editor

1:09:07.900 --> 1:09:10.740
 at the Atlantic, a guy named Ian Bogost.

1:09:10.740 --> 1:09:13.060
 And the title is something like,

1:09:13.060 --> 1:09:15.380
 Americans Will Sacrifice Anything

1:09:15.380 --> 1:09:17.500
 for the College Experience.

1:09:17.500 --> 1:09:20.300
 And it's about why we went back to college

1:09:20.300 --> 1:09:22.420
 and why people wanted us to go back to college.

1:09:22.420 --> 1:09:24.580
 And it's not greedy presidents

1:09:24.580 --> 1:09:26.300
 trying to get the last dollar from someone.

1:09:26.300 --> 1:09:28.000
 It's because they want to go to college.

1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:29.880
 And what they're paying for is not the classes.

1:09:29.880 --> 1:09:32.200
 What they're paying for is the college experience.

1:09:32.200 --> 1:09:33.580
 It's not the education that's being there.

1:09:33.580 --> 1:09:35.580
 I've believed this for a long time,

1:09:35.580 --> 1:09:39.080
 that we continually make this mistake of,

1:09:39.080 --> 1:09:40.660
 people want to go back to college

1:09:40.660 --> 1:09:42.340
 as being people want to go back to class.

1:09:42.340 --> 1:09:43.180
 They don't.

1:09:43.180 --> 1:09:44.000
 They want to go back to campus.

1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:44.840
 They want to move away from home.

1:09:44.840 --> 1:09:47.240
 They want to do all those things that people experience.

1:09:47.240 --> 1:09:48.140
 It's a rite of passage.

1:09:48.140 --> 1:09:53.140
 It's an identity, if I can steal some of Ian's words here.

1:09:53.740 --> 1:09:54.760
 And I think that's right.

1:09:54.760 --> 1:09:57.140
 And I think what we've learned through COVID

1:09:57.140 --> 1:09:59.780
 is it has made it,

1:09:59.780 --> 1:10:02.300
 the disaggregation was not the disaggregation

1:10:02.300 --> 1:10:05.140
 of the education from the place, the university place,

1:10:05.140 --> 1:10:07.080
 and that you can get the best anywhere you want to.

1:10:07.080 --> 1:10:08.100
 Turns out there's lots of reasons

1:10:08.100 --> 1:10:10.220
 why that is not necessarily true.

1:10:10.220 --> 1:10:13.220
 The disaggregation is having it shoved in our faces

1:10:13.220 --> 1:10:14.960
 that the reason to go, again,

1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:16.700
 that the reason to go to college

1:10:16.700 --> 1:10:18.280
 is not necessarily to learn.

1:10:18.280 --> 1:10:20.180
 It's to have the college experience.

1:10:20.180 --> 1:10:21.780
 And that's very difficult for us to accept,

1:10:21.780 --> 1:10:23.820
 even though we behave that way,

1:10:23.820 --> 1:10:25.620
 most of us, when we were undergrads.

1:10:26.620 --> 1:10:28.740
 A lot of us didn't go to every single class.

1:10:28.740 --> 1:10:30.660
 We learned and we got it and we look back on it

1:10:30.660 --> 1:10:32.320
 and we're happy we had the learning experience as well,

1:10:32.320 --> 1:10:33.420
 obviously, particularly us,

1:10:33.420 --> 1:10:35.380
 because this is the kind of thing that we do.

1:10:35.380 --> 1:10:36.860
 And my guess is that's true

1:10:36.860 --> 1:10:39.380
 of the vast majority of your audience.

1:10:39.380 --> 1:10:41.600
 But that doesn't mean the,

1:10:41.600 --> 1:10:43.380
 I'm standing in front of you telling you this,

1:10:43.380 --> 1:10:47.380
 is the thing that people are excited about.

1:10:47.380 --> 1:10:49.060
 And that's why they want to be there,

1:10:49.060 --> 1:10:50.860
 primarily why they want to be there.

1:10:50.860 --> 1:10:54.380
 So to me, that's what COVID has forced us to deal with,

1:10:54.380 --> 1:10:57.020
 even though I think we're still all in deep denial about it

1:10:57.020 --> 1:10:59.900
 and hoping that it'll go back to that.

1:10:59.900 --> 1:11:01.520
 And I think about 85% of it will.

1:11:01.520 --> 1:11:02.360
 We'll be able to pretend

1:11:02.360 --> 1:11:03.620
 that that's really the way it is, again,

1:11:03.620 --> 1:11:05.340
 and we'll forget the lessons of this.

1:11:05.340 --> 1:11:07.500
 But technically what'll come out of it,

1:11:07.500 --> 1:11:09.060
 or technologically what'll come out of it

1:11:09.060 --> 1:11:12.700
 is a way of providing a more dispersed experience

1:11:12.700 --> 1:11:13.820
 through online education

1:11:13.820 --> 1:11:16.020
 and these kinds of remote things that we've learned.

1:11:16.020 --> 1:11:19.060
 And we'll have to come up with new ways to engage them

1:11:19.060 --> 1:11:20.540
 in the experience of college,

1:11:20.540 --> 1:11:22.060
 which includes not just the parties

1:11:22.060 --> 1:11:23.580
 or the whatever kids do,

1:11:23.580 --> 1:11:25.460
 but the learning part of it

1:11:25.460 --> 1:11:27.060
 so that they actually come out four or five

1:11:27.060 --> 1:11:30.900
 or six years later with having actually learned something.

1:11:30.900 --> 1:11:32.700
 So I think the world

1:11:32.700 --> 1:11:34.080
 will be radically different afterwards.

1:11:34.080 --> 1:11:36.200
 And I think technology will matter for that,

1:11:36.200 --> 1:11:38.460
 just not in the way that the people

1:11:38.460 --> 1:11:40.700
 who were building the technology originally

1:11:40.700 --> 1:11:42.120
 imagined it would be.

1:11:42.120 --> 1:11:45.260
 And I think this would have been true even without COVID,

1:11:45.260 --> 1:11:47.840
 but COVID has accelerated that reality.

1:11:47.840 --> 1:11:50.200
 So it's happening in two or three years or five years,

1:11:50.200 --> 1:11:52.180
 as opposed to 10 or 15.

1:11:52.180 --> 1:11:56.180
 That was an amazing answer that I did not understand.

1:11:56.180 --> 1:11:58.180
 It was passionate and meaningful.

1:11:58.180 --> 1:11:59.180
 Shots fired.

1:11:59.180 --> 1:12:00.380
 But I don't, no, I just didn't,

1:12:00.380 --> 1:12:01.420
 no, I'm not trying to criticize it.

1:12:01.420 --> 1:12:03.220
 I just think, I don't think I'm getting it.

1:12:03.220 --> 1:12:05.420
 So you mentioned disaggregation.

1:12:05.420 --> 1:12:06.380
 So what's that?

1:12:06.380 --> 1:12:09.480
 Well, so the power of technology

1:12:09.480 --> 1:12:11.580
 that if you go on the West Coast and hang out long enough

1:12:11.580 --> 1:12:13.580
 is all about we're gonna disaggregate these things together.

1:12:13.580 --> 1:12:15.900
 The books from the bookstore, that kind of a thing.

1:12:15.900 --> 1:12:17.820
 And then suddenly Amazon controls the universe, right?

1:12:17.820 --> 1:12:19.460
 And technology is a disruptor, right?

1:12:19.460 --> 1:12:20.820
 And people have been predicting that

1:12:20.820 --> 1:12:22.860
 for higher education for a long time,

1:12:22.860 --> 1:12:23.700
 but certainly in the age of moves.

1:12:23.700 --> 1:12:25.660
 So is this the sort of idea like

1:12:26.700 --> 1:12:30.120
 students can aggregate on a campus someplace

1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:33.500
 and then take classes over the network anywhere?

1:12:33.500 --> 1:12:34.900
 Yeah, this is what people thought was gonna happen,

1:12:34.900 --> 1:12:37.060
 or at least people claimed it was gonna happen, right?

1:12:37.060 --> 1:12:38.940
 Because my daughter is essentially doing that now.

1:12:38.940 --> 1:12:41.060
 She's on one campus, but learning in a different campus.

1:12:41.060 --> 1:12:43.580
 Sure, and COVID makes that possible, right?

1:12:43.580 --> 1:12:47.540
 COVID makes that legal, all but avoidable, right?

1:12:47.540 --> 1:12:49.480
 But the idea originally was that,

1:12:49.480 --> 1:12:51.180
 you and I were gonna create this machine learning class

1:12:51.180 --> 1:12:52.020
 and it was gonna be great,

1:12:52.020 --> 1:12:52.860
 and then no one else would,

1:12:52.860 --> 1:12:54.860
 there'd be the machine learning class everyone takes, right?

1:12:54.860 --> 1:12:57.300
 That was never gonna happen, but something like that,

1:12:57.300 --> 1:12:58.140
 you can see happening. But I feel like

1:12:58.140 --> 1:12:58.960
 you didn't address that.

1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:02.220
 Why, why, why is it that, why, why?

1:13:02.220 --> 1:13:04.220
 I don't think that will be the thing that happens.

1:13:04.220 --> 1:13:05.340
 So the college experience,

1:13:05.340 --> 1:13:07.220
 maybe I missed what the college experience was.

1:13:07.220 --> 1:13:10.140
 I thought it was peers, like people hanging around.

1:13:10.140 --> 1:13:11.660
 A large part of it is peers.

1:13:11.660 --> 1:13:13.600
 Well, it's peers and independence.

1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:15.040
 Yeah, but none of that,

1:13:15.040 --> 1:13:17.320
 you can do classes online for all of that.

1:13:17.320 --> 1:13:20.780
 No, no, no, no, because we're social people, right?

1:13:20.780 --> 1:13:21.620
 So you wanna be in the same room.

1:13:21.620 --> 1:13:22.440
 So when we take the classes,

1:13:22.440 --> 1:13:25.200
 that also has to be part of an experience.

1:13:25.200 --> 1:13:27.340
 It's in a context, and the context is the university.

1:13:27.340 --> 1:13:29.580
 And by the way, it actually matters

1:13:29.580 --> 1:13:32.060
 that Georgia Tech really is different from Brown.

1:13:33.260 --> 1:13:36.120
 I see, because then students can choose

1:13:36.120 --> 1:13:37.220
 the kind of experience they think

1:13:37.220 --> 1:13:38.300
 is gonna be best for them.

1:13:38.300 --> 1:13:41.060
 Okay, I think we're giving too much agency to the students

1:13:41.060 --> 1:13:42.460
 in making an informed decision.

1:13:42.460 --> 1:13:43.300
 Okay. But the truth,

1:13:43.300 --> 1:13:45.480
 but yes, they will make choices

1:13:45.480 --> 1:13:46.780
 and they will have different experiences.

1:13:46.780 --> 1:13:48.620
 And some of those choices will be made for them.

1:13:48.620 --> 1:13:49.980
 Some of them will be choices they're making

1:13:49.980 --> 1:13:51.620
 because they think it's this, that, or the other.

1:13:51.620 --> 1:13:52.700
 I just don't want to say,

1:13:52.700 --> 1:13:53.540
 I don't want to give the idea.

1:13:53.540 --> 1:13:55.100
 It's not homogenous.

1:13:55.100 --> 1:13:56.940
 Yes, it's certainly not homogenous, right?

1:13:56.940 --> 1:13:59.420
 I mean, Georgia Tech is different from Brown.

1:13:59.420 --> 1:14:03.340
 Brown is different from pick your favorite state school

1:14:03.340 --> 1:14:05.780
 in Iowa, Iowa State, okay?

1:14:05.780 --> 1:14:07.900
 Which I guess is my favorite state school in Iowa.

1:14:07.900 --> 1:14:09.700
 But these are all different.

1:14:09.700 --> 1:14:10.700
 They have different contexts.

1:14:10.700 --> 1:14:12.180
 And a lot of those contexts are,

1:14:12.180 --> 1:14:13.560
 they're about history, yes,

1:14:13.560 --> 1:14:15.980
 but they're also about the location of where you are.

1:14:15.980 --> 1:14:18.240
 They're about the larger group of people who are around you,

1:14:18.240 --> 1:14:20.560
 whether you're in Athens, Georgia,

1:14:20.560 --> 1:14:23.120
 and you're basically the only thing that's there

1:14:23.120 --> 1:14:25.340
 as a university, you're responsible for all the jobs,

1:14:25.340 --> 1:14:27.100
 or whether you're at Georgia State University,

1:14:27.100 --> 1:14:28.980
 which is an urban campus,

1:14:28.980 --> 1:14:31.860
 where you're surrounded by six million people

1:14:31.860 --> 1:14:33.920
 in your campus where it ends and begins in the city,

1:14:33.920 --> 1:14:35.540
 ends and begins, we don't know.

1:14:35.540 --> 1:14:37.300
 It actually matters whether you're a small campus

1:14:37.300 --> 1:14:38.140
 or a large campus.

1:14:38.140 --> 1:14:38.960
 I mean, these things matter.

1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:41.580
 Why is it that if you go to Georgia Tech,

1:14:41.580 --> 1:14:44.860
 you're forever proud of that,

1:14:44.860 --> 1:14:47.380
 and you say that to people at dinners,

1:14:47.380 --> 1:14:49.400
 like bars and whatever,

1:14:49.400 --> 1:14:54.400
 and if you get a degree at an online university somewhere,

1:14:56.660 --> 1:14:58.940
 that's not a thing that comes up at a bar.

1:14:58.940 --> 1:14:59.800
 Well, it's funny you say that.

1:14:59.800 --> 1:15:02.740
 So the students who take our online masters

1:15:03.700 --> 1:15:06.580
 by several measures are more loyal

1:15:06.580 --> 1:15:07.820
 than the students who come on campus,

1:15:07.820 --> 1:15:09.300
 certainly for the master's degree.

1:15:09.300 --> 1:15:10.920
 The reason for that, I think,

1:15:10.920 --> 1:15:11.840
 and you'd have to ask them,

1:15:11.840 --> 1:15:13.920
 but based on my conversations with them,

1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:15.460
 I feel comfortable saying this,

1:15:15.460 --> 1:15:18.100
 is because this didn't exist before.

1:15:18.100 --> 1:15:19.740
 I mean, we talk about this online masters

1:15:19.740 --> 1:15:22.060
 and that it's reaching 11,000 students,

1:15:22.060 --> 1:15:22.980
 and that's an amazing thing,

1:15:22.980 --> 1:15:25.060
 and we're admitting everyone we believe who can succeed.

1:15:25.060 --> 1:15:26.620
 We got a 60% acceptance rate.

1:15:26.620 --> 1:15:27.820
 It's amazing, right?

1:15:27.820 --> 1:15:29.660
 It's also a $6,600 degree.

1:15:29.660 --> 1:15:32.020
 The entire degree costs $6,600 or $7,000,

1:15:32.020 --> 1:15:33.440
 depending on how long you take.

1:15:33.440 --> 1:15:35.580
 A dollar degree, as opposed to $46,000

1:15:35.580 --> 1:15:37.860
 it would cost you to come on campus.

1:15:37.860 --> 1:15:40.540
 So that feels, and I can do it while I'm working full time,

1:15:40.540 --> 1:15:42.180
 and I've got a family and a mortgage

1:15:42.180 --> 1:15:43.340
 and all these other things.

1:15:43.340 --> 1:15:46.220
 So it's an opportunity to do something you wanted to do,

1:15:46.220 --> 1:15:47.700
 but you didn't think was possible

1:15:47.700 --> 1:15:50.300
 without giving up two years of your life,

1:15:50.300 --> 1:15:51.300
 as well as all the money

1:15:51.300 --> 1:15:53.140
 and everything else in the life that you had built.

1:15:53.140 --> 1:15:56.940
 So I think we created something that's had an impact,

1:15:56.940 --> 1:15:59.640
 but importantly, we gave a set of people opportunities

1:15:59.640 --> 1:16:00.840
 they otherwise didn't feel they had.

1:16:00.840 --> 1:16:02.860
 So I think people feel very loyal about that.

1:16:02.860 --> 1:16:04.180
 And my biggest piece of evidence for that,

1:16:04.180 --> 1:16:05.320
 besides the surveys,

1:16:05.320 --> 1:16:08.660
 is that we have somewhere north of 80 students,

1:16:08.660 --> 1:16:09.980
 might be 100 at this point,

1:16:09.980 --> 1:16:14.980
 who graduated, but come back in TA for this class,

1:16:15.020 --> 1:16:16.780
 for basically minimum wage,

1:16:16.780 --> 1:16:17.980
 even though they're working full time,

1:16:17.980 --> 1:16:21.940
 because they believe in sort of having that opportunity

1:16:21.940 --> 1:16:23.360
 and they wanna be a part of something.

1:16:23.360 --> 1:16:25.980
 Now, will generation three feel this way?

1:16:25.980 --> 1:16:28.020
 15 years from now, will people have that same sense?

1:16:28.020 --> 1:16:31.100
 I don't know, but right now they kind of do.

1:16:31.100 --> 1:16:32.900
 And so it's not the online,

1:16:32.900 --> 1:16:36.140
 it's a matter of feeling as if you're a part of something.

1:16:36.140 --> 1:16:39.020
 Right, we're all very tribal, right?

1:16:39.020 --> 1:16:42.100
 And I think there's something very tribal

1:16:42.100 --> 1:16:44.280
 about being a part of something like that.

1:16:44.280 --> 1:16:45.880
 Being on campus makes that easier,

1:16:45.880 --> 1:16:48.220
 going through a shared experience makes that easier.

1:16:48.220 --> 1:16:49.720
 It's harder to have that shared experience

1:16:49.720 --> 1:16:52.020
 if you're alone looking at a computer screen.

1:16:52.020 --> 1:16:53.340
 We can create ways to make that true.

1:16:53.340 --> 1:16:54.340
 But is it possible?

1:16:54.340 --> 1:16:55.220
 It is possible.

1:16:55.220 --> 1:16:58.360
 The question is, it still is the intuition to me,

1:16:58.360 --> 1:17:01.420
 and it was at the beginning when I saw something

1:17:01.420 --> 1:17:04.580
 like the online master's program,

1:17:04.580 --> 1:17:07.980
 is that this is gonna replace universities.

1:17:07.980 --> 1:17:09.200
 No, it won't replace universities.

1:17:09.200 --> 1:17:11.080
 But like why?

1:17:11.080 --> 1:17:11.920
 Because it's living

1:17:11.920 --> 1:17:13.920
 in a different part of the ecosystem, right?

1:17:13.920 --> 1:17:15.660
 The people who are taking it are already adults,

1:17:15.660 --> 1:17:18.720
 they've gone through their undergrad experience.

1:17:18.720 --> 1:17:21.900
 I think their goals have shifted from when they were 17.

1:17:21.900 --> 1:17:23.380
 They have other things that are going on.

1:17:23.380 --> 1:17:25.540
 But it does do something really important,

1:17:25.540 --> 1:17:28.380
 something very social and very important, right?

1:17:28.380 --> 1:17:30.220
 You know this whole thing about,

1:17:30.220 --> 1:17:32.060
 don't build the sidewalks, just leave the grass

1:17:32.060 --> 1:17:33.640
 and the students or the people will walk

1:17:33.640 --> 1:17:35.340
 and you put the sidewalks where they create paths,

1:17:35.340 --> 1:17:36.180
 this kind of thing.

1:17:36.180 --> 1:17:37.580
 That's interesting, yeah.

1:17:37.580 --> 1:17:39.060
 Their architects apparently believe

1:17:39.060 --> 1:17:40.740
 that's the right way to do things.

1:17:40.740 --> 1:17:45.260
 The metaphor here is that we created this environment,

1:17:45.260 --> 1:17:48.660
 we didn't quite know how to think about the social aspect,

1:17:48.660 --> 1:17:51.100
 but we didn't have time to solve all,

1:17:51.100 --> 1:17:53.100
 do all the social engineering, right?

1:17:53.100 --> 1:17:54.220
 The students did it themselves,

1:17:54.220 --> 1:17:58.400
 they created these groups, like on Google Plus,

1:17:58.400 --> 1:18:00.160
 there were like 30 something groups created

1:18:00.160 --> 1:18:04.220
 in the first year because somebody had used Google Plus.

1:18:04.220 --> 1:18:05.680
 And they created these groups

1:18:05.680 --> 1:18:07.380
 and they divided up in ways that made sense.

1:18:07.380 --> 1:18:08.620
 We live in the same state or we're working

1:18:08.620 --> 1:18:10.060
 on the same things or we have the same background

1:18:10.060 --> 1:18:12.060
 or whatever and they created these social things.

1:18:12.060 --> 1:18:14.100
 We sent them T shirts and they wear,

1:18:14.100 --> 1:18:16.540
 we have all these great pictures of students

1:18:16.540 --> 1:18:18.340
 putting on their T shirts as they travel around the world.

1:18:18.340 --> 1:18:20.560
 I climbed this mountain top, I'm putting this T shirt on,

1:18:20.560 --> 1:18:22.060
 I'm a part of this, they were a part of them.

1:18:22.060 --> 1:18:24.660
 They created the social environment

1:18:24.660 --> 1:18:26.740
 on top of the social network and the social media

1:18:26.740 --> 1:18:29.380
 that existed to create this sense of belonging

1:18:29.380 --> 1:18:30.500
 and being a part of something.

1:18:30.500 --> 1:18:32.700
 They found a way to do it, right?

1:18:32.700 --> 1:18:36.180
 And I think they had other,

1:18:36.180 --> 1:18:38.100
 it scratched an itch that they had,

1:18:38.100 --> 1:18:40.140
 but they had scratched some of that itch

1:18:40.140 --> 1:18:41.500
 that might've required they'd be physically

1:18:41.500 --> 1:18:44.420
 in the same place long before, right?

1:18:44.420 --> 1:18:47.220
 So I think, yes, it's possible

1:18:47.220 --> 1:18:49.640
 and it's more than possible, it's necessary.

1:18:49.640 --> 1:18:54.220
 But I don't think it's going to replace the university

1:18:54.220 --> 1:18:55.180
 as we know it.

1:18:55.180 --> 1:18:57.620
 The university as we know it will change.

1:18:57.620 --> 1:18:59.180
 But there's just a lot of power

1:18:59.180 --> 1:19:00.440
 in the kind of rite of passage

1:19:00.440 --> 1:19:01.500
 kind of going off to yourself.

1:19:01.500 --> 1:19:03.140
 Now, maybe there'll be some other rite of passage

1:19:03.140 --> 1:19:03.980
 that'll happen.

1:19:03.980 --> 1:19:06.100
 That'll drive us somewhere else, it's possible.

1:19:06.100 --> 1:19:11.100
 So the university is such a fascinating mess of things.

1:19:11.100 --> 1:19:14.660
 So just even the faculty position is a fascinating mess.

1:19:14.660 --> 1:19:15.900
 Like it doesn't make any sense.

1:19:15.900 --> 1:19:18.260
 It's stabilized itself,

1:19:18.260 --> 1:19:22.080
 but like why are the world class researchers

1:19:22.080 --> 1:19:26.660
 spending a huge amount of time or their time teaching

1:19:26.660 --> 1:19:27.980
 and service?

1:19:27.980 --> 1:19:29.540
 Like you're doing like three jobs.

1:19:29.540 --> 1:19:34.540
 And I mean, it turns out it's maybe an accident of history

1:19:34.980 --> 1:19:36.340
 or human evolution, I don't know.

1:19:36.340 --> 1:19:38.460
 It seems like the people who are really good at teaching

1:19:38.460 --> 1:19:40.420
 are often really good at research.

1:19:40.420 --> 1:19:42.780
 There seems to be a parallel there,

1:19:42.780 --> 1:19:44.480
 but like it doesn't make any sense

1:19:44.480 --> 1:19:45.460
 that you should be doing that.

1:19:45.460 --> 1:19:48.740
 At the same time, it also doesn't seem to make sense

1:19:48.740 --> 1:19:52.060
 that your place where you party

1:19:53.840 --> 1:19:56.340
 is the same place where you go to learn calculus

1:19:56.340 --> 1:19:57.540
 or whatever.

1:19:57.540 --> 1:19:59.300
 But it's a safe space.

1:19:59.300 --> 1:20:00.540
 Safe space for everything.

1:20:00.540 --> 1:20:02.380
 Yeah, relatively speaking, it's a safe space.

1:20:02.380 --> 1:20:05.300
 Now, by the way, I feel the need very strongly

1:20:05.300 --> 1:20:07.180
 to point out that we are living

1:20:07.180 --> 1:20:09.500
 in a very particular weird bubble, right?

1:20:09.500 --> 1:20:10.860
 Most people don't go to college.

1:20:10.860 --> 1:20:12.880
 And by the way, the ones who do go to college,

1:20:12.880 --> 1:20:14.340
 they're not 18 years old, right?

1:20:14.340 --> 1:20:15.500
 They're like 25 or something.

1:20:15.500 --> 1:20:17.120
 I forget the numbers.

1:20:17.120 --> 1:20:19.940
 The places where we've been, where we are,

1:20:20.940 --> 1:20:22.380
 they look like whatever we think

1:20:22.380 --> 1:20:25.520
 the traditional movie version of universities are.

1:20:25.520 --> 1:20:27.460
 But for most people, it's not that way at all.

1:20:27.460 --> 1:20:28.940
 By the way, most people who drop out of college,

1:20:28.940 --> 1:20:31.420
 it's entirely for financial reasons, right?

1:20:32.320 --> 1:20:35.340
 So we were talking about a particular experience.

1:20:36.700 --> 1:20:38.700
 And so for that set of people,

1:20:38.700 --> 1:20:42.940
 which is very small, but larger than it was a decade

1:20:42.940 --> 1:20:45.020
 or two or three or four, certainly, ago,

1:20:45.940 --> 1:20:47.180
 I don't think that will change.

1:20:47.180 --> 1:20:50.460
 My concern, which I think is kind of implicit

1:20:50.460 --> 1:20:51.540
 in some of these questions,

1:20:51.540 --> 1:20:54.220
 is that somehow we will divide the world up further

1:20:55.440 --> 1:20:57.060
 into the people who get to have this experience

1:20:57.060 --> 1:20:57.900
 and get to have the network

1:20:57.900 --> 1:20:59.220
 and they sort of benefit from it,

1:20:59.220 --> 1:21:01.900
 and everyone else, while increasingly requiring

1:21:01.900 --> 1:21:03.180
 that they have more and more credentials

1:21:03.180 --> 1:21:05.920
 in order to get a job as a barista, right?

1:21:05.920 --> 1:21:07.020
 You gotta have a master's degree

1:21:07.020 --> 1:21:08.780
 in order to work at Starbucks.

1:21:08.780 --> 1:21:10.740
 I mean, we're gonna force people to do these things,

1:21:10.740 --> 1:21:12.460
 but they're not gonna get to have that experience,

1:21:12.460 --> 1:21:13.860
 and there'll be a small group of people who do

1:21:13.860 --> 1:21:15.740
 who will continue to, you know, positive feedback,

1:21:15.740 --> 1:21:16.940
 look, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1:21:16.940 --> 1:21:19.860
 I worry a lot about that, which is why, for me,

1:21:21.060 --> 1:21:21.980
 and by the way, here's an answer

1:21:21.980 --> 1:21:22.940
 to your question about faculty,

1:21:22.940 --> 1:21:24.400
 which is why, to me, that you have to focus

1:21:24.400 --> 1:21:26.060
 on access and the mission.

1:21:26.060 --> 1:21:28.180
 I think the reason, whether it's good, bad, or strange,

1:21:28.180 --> 1:21:29.740
 I mean, I agree, it's strange,

1:21:29.740 --> 1:21:32.180
 but I think it's useful to have the faculty member,

1:21:32.180 --> 1:21:33.860
 particularly at large R1 universities

1:21:33.860 --> 1:21:36.580
 where we've all had experiences,

1:21:36.580 --> 1:21:41.060
 that you tie what they get to do

1:21:41.060 --> 1:21:43.900
 and with the fundamental mission of the university

1:21:43.900 --> 1:21:45.060
 and let the mission drive.

1:21:45.060 --> 1:21:47.080
 What I hear when I talk to faculty is,

1:21:47.080 --> 1:21:48.340
 they love their PhD students

1:21:48.340 --> 1:21:51.100
 because they're reproducing, basically, right?

1:21:51.100 --> 1:21:53.700
 And it lets them do their research and multiply.

1:21:53.700 --> 1:21:57.300
 But they understand that the mission is the undergrads,

1:21:57.300 --> 1:22:00.380
 and so they will do it without complaint, mostly,

1:22:00.380 --> 1:22:02.420
 because it's a part of the mission and why they're here,

1:22:02.420 --> 1:22:04.140
 and they have experiences with it themselves,

1:22:04.140 --> 1:22:06.340
 and it was important to get them

1:22:06.340 --> 1:22:07.420
 where they were going.

1:22:07.420 --> 1:22:09.020
 The people who tend to get squeezed in that, by the way,

1:22:09.020 --> 1:22:10.380
 are the master's students, right,

1:22:10.380 --> 1:22:12.220
 who are neither the PhDs who are like us

1:22:12.220 --> 1:22:14.820
 nor the undergrads we have already bought into the idea

1:22:14.820 --> 1:22:16.460
 that we have to teach, though.

1:22:16.460 --> 1:22:18.180
 That's increasingly changing.

1:22:18.180 --> 1:22:21.020
 Anyway, I think tying that mission in really matters,

1:22:21.020 --> 1:22:23.260
 and it gives you a way to unify people

1:22:23.260 --> 1:22:26.100
 around making it an actual higher calling.

1:22:26.100 --> 1:22:28.100
 Education feels like more of a higher calling to me

1:22:28.100 --> 1:22:29.720
 than even research,

1:22:30.780 --> 1:22:33.860
 because education, you cannot treat it as a hobby

1:22:33.860 --> 1:22:34.900
 if you're going to do it well.

1:22:34.900 --> 1:22:38.380
 But that's the pushback on this whole system

1:22:38.380 --> 1:22:43.380
 is that education should be a full time job, right?

1:22:44.420 --> 1:22:49.020
 And it's almost like research is a distraction from that.

1:22:49.020 --> 1:22:51.300
 Yes, although I think most of our colleagues,

1:22:51.300 --> 1:22:53.340
 many of our colleagues would say that research is the job

1:22:53.340 --> 1:22:55.100
 and education is the distraction.

1:22:55.100 --> 1:22:56.620
 Right, but that's the beautiful dance.

1:22:56.620 --> 1:23:01.360
 It seems to be that tension in itself seems to work,

1:23:01.360 --> 1:23:05.820
 seems to bring out the best in the faculty.

1:23:07.220 --> 1:23:08.300
 But I will point out two things.

1:23:08.300 --> 1:23:09.120
 One thing I'm going to point out,

1:23:09.120 --> 1:23:10.740
 and the other thing I want Michael to point out,

1:23:10.740 --> 1:23:11.920
 because I think Michael is much closer

1:23:11.920 --> 1:23:16.920
 to sort of the ideal professor in some sense than I am.

1:23:17.260 --> 1:23:18.100
 Well, he is a dean.

1:23:18.100 --> 1:23:19.620
 You're the platonic sense of a professor.

1:23:19.620 --> 1:23:20.860
 I don't know what he meant by that,

1:23:20.860 --> 1:23:23.340
 but he is a dean, so he has a different experience.

1:23:23.340 --> 1:23:26.200
 I'm giving him time to think of the profound thing

1:23:26.200 --> 1:23:27.040
 he's going to say.

1:23:27.040 --> 1:23:27.860
 That was good.

1:23:27.860 --> 1:23:28.700
 But let me point this out,

1:23:28.700 --> 1:23:31.500
 which is that we have lecturers

1:23:31.500 --> 1:23:33.900
 in the College of Computing where I am.

1:23:33.900 --> 1:23:35.640
 There's 10 or 12 of them, depending on how you count,

1:23:35.640 --> 1:23:39.140
 as opposed to the 90 or so tenure track faculty.

1:23:39.140 --> 1:23:41.140
 Those 10 lecturers who only teach,

1:23:41.140 --> 1:23:42.860
 well, they don't only teach, they also do service.

1:23:42.860 --> 1:23:46.560
 Some of them do research as well, but primarily they teach.

1:23:46.560 --> 1:23:49.620
 They teach 50%, over 50% of our credit hours,

1:23:49.620 --> 1:23:51.260
 and we teach everybody, right?

1:23:51.260 --> 1:23:54.100
 So they're doing not just,

1:23:54.100 --> 1:23:56.300
 they're doing more than eight times the work

1:23:56.300 --> 1:23:59.180
 of the tenure track faculty,

1:23:59.180 --> 1:24:01.620
 just more closer to nine or 10.

1:24:01.620 --> 1:24:03.020
 And that's including our grad courses, right?

1:24:03.020 --> 1:24:05.100
 So they're doing this, they're teaching more,

1:24:05.100 --> 1:24:07.100
 they're touching more than anyone,

1:24:07.100 --> 1:24:08.860
 and they're beloved for it.

1:24:08.860 --> 1:24:11.660
 I mean, so we recently had a survey.

1:24:11.660 --> 1:24:12.900
 Everyone does these alumni surveys.

1:24:12.900 --> 1:24:14.260
 You hire someone from the outside to do whatever,

1:24:14.260 --> 1:24:15.900
 and I was really struck by something.

1:24:15.900 --> 1:24:17.380
 You saw all these really cool numbers.

1:24:17.380 --> 1:24:18.260
 I'm not going to talk about it

1:24:18.260 --> 1:24:19.900
 because it's all internal, confidential stuff.

1:24:19.900 --> 1:24:21.140
 But one thing I will talk about

1:24:21.140 --> 1:24:23.100
 is there was a single question we asked our alum,

1:24:23.100 --> 1:24:24.420
 and these are people who graduated,

1:24:24.420 --> 1:24:25.860
 born in the 30s and 40s,

1:24:25.860 --> 1:24:28.520
 all the way up to people who graduated last week, right?

1:24:29.520 --> 1:24:30.540
 Well, last semester.

1:24:30.540 --> 1:24:31.380
 Okay, good.

1:24:32.480 --> 1:24:33.320
 Time flies.

1:24:33.320 --> 1:24:34.680
 Yeah, time flies.

1:24:34.680 --> 1:24:36.420
 And it was the question,

1:24:36.420 --> 1:24:40.900
 name a single person who had a strong positive impact on you,

1:24:40.900 --> 1:24:42.100
 something like that.

1:24:42.100 --> 1:24:44.340
 I think it was special impact?

1:24:44.340 --> 1:24:45.580
 Yeah, special impact on you.

1:24:45.580 --> 1:24:47.220
 And then, so they got all the answers from people,

1:24:47.220 --> 1:24:49.040
 and they created a word cloud.

1:24:49.040 --> 1:24:50.540
 It was clearly a word cloud created by people

1:24:50.540 --> 1:24:52.220
 who don't do word clouds for a living

1:24:52.220 --> 1:24:54.780
 because they had one person whose name appeared

1:24:54.780 --> 1:24:56.220
 like nine different times,

1:24:56.220 --> 1:24:59.340
 like Philip, Phil, Dr. Phil, you know, but whatever.

1:24:59.340 --> 1:25:00.180
 But they got all this.

1:25:00.180 --> 1:25:02.340
 And I looked at it, and I noticed something really cool.

1:25:02.340 --> 1:25:06.700
 The five people from the College of Computing,

1:25:06.700 --> 1:25:09.220
 I recognized, were in that cloud.

1:25:09.220 --> 1:25:13.780
 And four of them were lecturers,

1:25:13.780 --> 1:25:15.220
 the people who teach.

1:25:15.220 --> 1:25:17.320
 Two of them, relatively modern,

1:25:17.320 --> 1:25:19.840
 both were chairs of our division of computing instruction.

1:25:19.840 --> 1:25:22.180
 One just, one retired, one is going to retire soon.

1:25:22.180 --> 1:25:23.620
 And the other two were lecturers,

1:25:23.620 --> 1:25:26.460
 I remembered, from the 1980s.

1:25:26.460 --> 1:25:28.020
 Two of those four actually have.

1:25:28.020 --> 1:25:29.700
 By the way, the fifth person was Charles.

1:25:29.700 --> 1:25:30.540
 That's not important.

1:25:30.540 --> 1:25:32.920
 The thing is, I don't tell people that.

1:25:32.920 --> 1:25:34.540
 But the two of those people

1:25:34.540 --> 1:25:36.000
 our teaching awards are named after.

1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:36.840
 Thank you, Michael.

1:25:36.840 --> 1:25:39.680
 Two of those our teaching awards are named after, right?

1:25:39.680 --> 1:25:41.720
 So when you ask students, alumni,

1:25:41.720 --> 1:25:44.220
 people who are now 60, 70 years old even,

1:25:44.220 --> 1:25:45.280
 you know, who touched them?

1:25:45.280 --> 1:25:46.660
 They say the Dean of Students.

1:25:46.660 --> 1:25:48.260
 They say the big teachers who taught

1:25:48.260 --> 1:25:50.220
 the big introductory classes that got me into it.

1:25:50.220 --> 1:25:52.300
 There's a guy named Richard Park who's on there,

1:25:52.300 --> 1:25:55.380
 who's, you know, who's known as a great teacher.

1:25:55.380 --> 1:25:57.060
 The Phil Adler guy who,

1:25:58.500 --> 1:26:00.060
 I probably just said his last name wrong,

1:26:00.060 --> 1:26:01.100
 but I know the first name's Phil

1:26:01.100 --> 1:26:03.140
 because he kept showing up over and over again.

1:26:03.140 --> 1:26:03.960
 Famous.

1:26:03.960 --> 1:26:04.800
 Adler is what it said.

1:26:04.800 --> 1:26:05.640
 Okay, good.

1:26:05.640 --> 1:26:06.820
 But different people spelled it differently.

1:26:06.820 --> 1:26:07.940
 So he appeared multiple times.

1:26:07.940 --> 1:26:08.780
 Right.

1:26:08.780 --> 1:26:10.500
 So he was a, clearly,

1:26:10.500 --> 1:26:13.040
 he was a professor in the business school.

1:26:14.180 --> 1:26:15.860
 But when you read about him,

1:26:15.860 --> 1:26:17.420
 I went to read about him because I was curious who he was.

1:26:17.420 --> 1:26:18.660
 You know, it's all about his teaching

1:26:18.660 --> 1:26:20.060
 and the students that he touched, right?

1:26:20.060 --> 1:26:22.320
 So whatever it is that we're doing

1:26:22.320 --> 1:26:23.420
 and we think we're doing that's important

1:26:23.420 --> 1:26:25.340
 or why we think the universities function,

1:26:25.340 --> 1:26:26.740
 the people who go through it,

1:26:27.740 --> 1:26:29.500
 they remember the people who were kind to them,

1:26:29.500 --> 1:26:31.380
 the people who taught them something,

1:26:31.380 --> 1:26:32.460
 and they do remember it.

1:26:32.460 --> 1:26:33.500
 They remember it later.

1:26:33.500 --> 1:26:35.820
 I think that's important.

1:26:35.820 --> 1:26:37.200
 That's why the mission matters.

1:26:37.200 --> 1:26:38.040
 Yeah.

1:26:38.040 --> 1:26:41.940
 Not to completely lose track of the fundamental problem

1:26:41.940 --> 1:26:46.940
 of how do we replace the party aspect of universities

1:26:46.940 --> 1:26:51.420
 before we go to the what makes the platonic professor.

1:26:51.420 --> 1:26:56.420
 Do you think, like, what in your sense is the role of MOOCs

1:26:57.960 --> 1:27:00.360
 in this whole picture during COVID?

1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:04.160
 Like, should we desperately be clamoring

1:27:04.160 --> 1:27:05.880
 to get back on campus?

1:27:05.880 --> 1:27:08.880
 Or is this a stable place to be for a little while?

1:27:08.880 --> 1:27:09.720
 I don't know.

1:27:09.720 --> 1:27:12.560
 I know that the online teaching experience

1:27:12.560 --> 1:27:15.920
 and learning experience has been really rough.

1:27:15.920 --> 1:27:18.240
 I think that people find it to be a struggle

1:27:18.240 --> 1:27:21.960
 in a way that's not a happy, positive struggle,

1:27:21.960 --> 1:27:23.080
 that when you got through it,

1:27:23.080 --> 1:27:24.760
 you just feel like glad that it's over

1:27:24.760 --> 1:27:27.780
 as opposed to I've achieved something.

1:27:27.780 --> 1:27:29.640
 So, you know, I worry about that.

1:27:29.640 --> 1:27:33.800
 But, you know, I worry about just even before this happened,

1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:35.640
 I worry about lecture teaching,

1:27:35.640 --> 1:27:38.700
 how well is that actually really working

1:27:38.700 --> 1:27:40.640
 as far as a way to do education,

1:27:40.640 --> 1:27:43.560
 as a way to inspire people.

1:27:43.560 --> 1:27:47.040
 I mean, all the data that I'm aware of seems to indicate,

1:27:47.040 --> 1:27:49.640
 and this kind of fits, I think, with Charles's story,

1:27:49.640 --> 1:27:54.480
 is that people respond to connection, right?

1:27:54.480 --> 1:27:57.400
 They actually feel, if they feel connected

1:27:57.400 --> 1:27:59.120
 to the person teaching the class,

1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:00.680
 they're more likely to go along with it.

1:28:00.680 --> 1:28:02.960
 They're more able to retain information.

1:28:02.960 --> 1:28:05.040
 They're more motivated to be involved

1:28:05.040 --> 1:28:06.840
 in the class in some way.

1:28:06.840 --> 1:28:09.840
 And that really matters.

1:28:09.840 --> 1:28:10.680
 People...

1:28:10.680 --> 1:28:12.160
 You mean to the human themselves.

1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:13.000
 Yeah.

1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:14.600
 Okay, can't you do that actually

1:28:14.600 --> 1:28:18.360
 perhaps more effectively online?

1:28:18.360 --> 1:28:20.220
 Like you mentioned, science communication.

1:28:20.220 --> 1:28:24.920
 So I literally, I think, learned linear algebra

1:28:24.920 --> 1:28:28.280
 from Gilbert Strang by watching MIT OpenCourseWare

1:28:28.280 --> 1:28:29.320
 when I was in track.

1:28:29.320 --> 1:28:31.040
 Like, and he was a personality,

1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:33.160
 he was a bit like a tiny...

1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:35.160
 In this tiny little world of math,

1:28:35.160 --> 1:28:36.560
 he's a bit of a rockstar, right?

1:28:36.560 --> 1:28:40.720
 So you kind of look up to that person.

1:28:40.720 --> 1:28:44.880
 Can't that replace the in person education?

1:28:44.880 --> 1:28:45.720
 It can help.

1:28:45.720 --> 1:28:47.520
 I will point out something, I can't share the numbers,

1:28:47.520 --> 1:28:50.000
 but we have surveyed our students,

1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:51.440
 and even though they have feelings

1:28:51.440 --> 1:28:54.400
 about what I would interpret as connection,

1:28:54.400 --> 1:28:58.440
 I like that word, in the different modes of classrooms,

1:28:58.440 --> 1:29:00.860
 there's no difference between how well

1:29:00.860 --> 1:29:02.560
 they think they're learning.

1:29:02.560 --> 1:29:05.680
 For them, the thing that makes them unhappy

1:29:05.680 --> 1:29:06.960
 is the situation they're in.

1:29:06.960 --> 1:29:08.700
 And I think the lack of connection,

1:29:08.700 --> 1:29:10.560
 it's not whether they're learning anything.

1:29:10.560 --> 1:29:13.360
 They seem to think they're learning something anyway, right?

1:29:13.360 --> 1:29:14.360
 In fact, they seem to think

1:29:14.360 --> 1:29:15.960
 they're learning it equally well,

1:29:16.920 --> 1:29:20.640
 presumably because the faculty are putting in,

1:29:20.640 --> 1:29:22.960
 or the instructors, more generally speaking,

1:29:22.960 --> 1:29:25.840
 are putting in the energy and effort

1:29:25.840 --> 1:29:28.920
 to try to make certain that what they've curated

1:29:28.920 --> 1:29:30.640
 can be expressed to them in a useful way.

1:29:30.640 --> 1:29:31.800
 But the connection is missing.

1:29:31.800 --> 1:29:34.160
 And so there's huge differences in what they prefer.

1:29:34.160 --> 1:29:35.000
 And as far as I can tell,

1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:37.360
 what they prefer is more connection, not less.

1:29:37.360 --> 1:29:39.440
 That connection just doesn't have to be physically

1:29:39.440 --> 1:29:40.280
 in a classroom.

1:29:40.280 --> 1:29:43.520
 I mean, look, I used to teach 348 students

1:29:43.520 --> 1:29:44.840
 in my machine learning class on campus.

1:29:44.840 --> 1:29:45.680
 Do you know why?

1:29:45.680 --> 1:29:47.440
 That was the biggest classroom on campus.

1:29:48.640 --> 1:29:50.840
 They're sitting in theater seats.

1:29:50.840 --> 1:29:54.400
 I'm literally on a stage looking down on them

1:29:54.400 --> 1:29:56.320
 and talking to them, right?

1:29:56.320 --> 1:29:59.640
 There's no, I mean, we're not sitting down,

1:29:59.640 --> 1:30:01.380
 having a one on one conversation,

1:30:01.380 --> 1:30:02.760
 reading each other's body language,

1:30:02.760 --> 1:30:04.080
 trying to communicate and going,

1:30:04.080 --> 1:30:05.400
 we're not doing any of that.

1:30:05.400 --> 1:30:07.520
 So if you're past the third row,

1:30:07.520 --> 1:30:08.800
 it might as well be online anyway

1:30:08.800 --> 1:30:10.280
 is the kind of thing that people have said.

1:30:10.280 --> 1:30:12.920
 Daphne has actually said some version of this

1:30:12.920 --> 1:30:15.600
 that online starts on the third row or something like that.

1:30:15.600 --> 1:30:18.560
 And I think that's not, yeah, I like it.

1:30:18.560 --> 1:30:20.320
 I think it captures something important.

1:30:20.320 --> 1:30:22.120
 But people still came, by the way.

1:30:22.120 --> 1:30:23.880
 Even the people who had access to our material

1:30:23.880 --> 1:30:25.240
 would still come to class.

1:30:25.240 --> 1:30:26.420
 I mean, there's a certain element

1:30:26.420 --> 1:30:28.560
 about looking to the person next to you.

1:30:28.560 --> 1:30:32.320
 It's just like their presence there, their boredom.

1:30:32.320 --> 1:30:34.960
 And like when the parts are boring

1:30:34.960 --> 1:30:37.960
 and their excitement when the parts are exciting,

1:30:37.960 --> 1:30:39.560
 like in sharing in that,

1:30:39.560 --> 1:30:43.680
 like unspoken kind of, yeah, communication.

1:30:43.680 --> 1:30:45.840
 In part, the connection is with the other people

1:30:45.840 --> 1:30:46.680
 in the room.

1:30:46.680 --> 1:30:51.680
 Yeah, watching the circus on TV alone is not really.

1:30:52.360 --> 1:30:53.440
 Ever been to a movie theater

1:30:53.440 --> 1:30:55.280
 and been the only one there at a comedy?

1:30:55.280 --> 1:30:58.200
 It's not as funny as when you're in a room

1:30:58.200 --> 1:31:00.080
 full of people all laughing.

1:31:00.080 --> 1:31:02.480
 Well, you need, maybe you need just another person.

1:31:02.480 --> 1:31:04.640
 It's like, as opposed to many.

1:31:04.640 --> 1:31:06.120
 Maybe there's some kind of.

1:31:06.120 --> 1:31:07.800
 Well, there's different kinds of connection, right?

1:31:07.800 --> 1:31:09.600
 And there's different kinds of comedy.

1:31:11.720 --> 1:31:12.560
 Well, in the sense that.

1:31:12.560 --> 1:31:13.680
 As we're learning today.

1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:16.200
 I wasn't sure if that was gonna land.

1:31:16.200 --> 1:31:21.200
 But just the idea that different jokes,

1:31:21.640 --> 1:31:23.120
 I've now done a little bit of standup.

1:31:23.120 --> 1:31:26.560
 And so different jokes work in different size crowds too.

1:31:26.560 --> 1:31:27.400
 No, it's true.

1:31:27.400 --> 1:31:30.320
 Where sometimes if it's a big enough crowd,

1:31:30.320 --> 1:31:33.600
 then even a really subtle joke can take root someplace

1:31:33.600 --> 1:31:34.920
 and then that cues other people.

1:31:34.920 --> 1:31:36.320
 And it kind of,

1:31:36.320 --> 1:31:38.640
 there's a whole statistics of.

1:31:38.640 --> 1:31:40.160
 I did this terrible thing to my brother.

1:31:40.160 --> 1:31:41.360
 So when I was really young,

1:31:41.360 --> 1:31:44.720
 I decided that my brother was only laughing

1:31:44.720 --> 1:31:46.480
 as it comes when I laughed.

1:31:46.480 --> 1:31:48.160
 Like he was taking cues from me.

1:31:48.160 --> 1:31:50.100
 So I like purposely didn't laugh

1:31:50.100 --> 1:31:50.940
 just to see if I was right.

1:31:50.940 --> 1:31:52.320
 And did you laugh at non funny things?

1:31:52.320 --> 1:31:53.160
 Yes.

1:31:53.160 --> 1:31:54.000
 You really wanna do both sides.

1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:54.960
 I did both sides.

1:31:54.960 --> 1:31:58.400
 And at the end of it, I told him what I did.

1:31:58.400 --> 1:32:00.000
 He was very upset about this.

1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:01.920
 And from that day on.

1:32:01.920 --> 1:32:03.000
 He lost his sense of humor.

1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:03.840
 No, no, no, no.

1:32:03.840 --> 1:32:04.660
 Well, yes.

1:32:04.660 --> 1:32:07.680
 But from that day on, he laughed on his own.

1:32:07.680 --> 1:32:08.760
 He stopped taking cues from me.

1:32:08.760 --> 1:32:09.600
 I see.

1:32:09.600 --> 1:32:11.720
 So I wanna say that it was a good thing that I did.

1:32:11.720 --> 1:32:12.560
 Yes, yes.

1:32:12.560 --> 1:32:14.040
 You saved that man's life.

1:32:14.040 --> 1:32:15.160
 Yes, but it was mostly mean.

1:32:15.160 --> 1:32:15.980
 But it's true though.

1:32:15.980 --> 1:32:16.820
 It's true, right?

1:32:16.820 --> 1:32:19.320
 That people, I think you're right.

1:32:19.320 --> 1:32:20.860
 But okay, so where does that get us?

1:32:20.860 --> 1:32:23.040
 That gets us the idea that,

1:32:23.040 --> 1:32:26.220
 I mean, certainly movie theaters are a thing, right?

1:32:26.220 --> 1:32:28.260
 Where people like to be watching together,

1:32:28.260 --> 1:32:30.800
 even though the people on the screen

1:32:30.800 --> 1:32:33.040
 aren't really co present with the people in the audience.

1:32:33.040 --> 1:32:35.000
 The audience is co present with themselves.

1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:36.200
 By the way, and that point,

1:32:36.200 --> 1:32:38.600
 it's an open question that's being raised by this,

1:32:38.600 --> 1:32:40.960
 whether movies will no longer be a thing

1:32:40.960 --> 1:32:43.720
 because Netflix's audience is growing.

1:32:43.720 --> 1:32:47.160
 So that's, it's a very parallel question for education.

1:32:47.160 --> 1:32:50.080
 Will movie theaters still be a thing in 2021?

1:32:50.080 --> 1:32:52.000
 No, but I think the argument is

1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:54.680
 that there is a feeling of being in the crowd

1:32:54.680 --> 1:32:57.480
 that isn't replicated by being at home watching it

1:32:57.480 --> 1:32:59.280
 and that there's value in that.

1:32:59.280 --> 1:33:00.120
 And then I think just.

1:33:00.120 --> 1:33:02.040
 But, but.

1:33:02.040 --> 1:33:03.280
 It scales better online.

1:33:03.280 --> 1:33:06.840
 But I feel like we're having a conversation

1:33:06.840 --> 1:33:09.320
 about whether concerts will still exist

1:33:09.320 --> 1:33:13.040
 after the invention of the record or the CD

1:33:13.040 --> 1:33:13.960
 or wherever it is, right?

1:33:13.960 --> 1:33:14.920
 They won't.

1:33:14.920 --> 1:33:16.880
 You're right, concerts are dead.

1:33:16.880 --> 1:33:19.580
 Well, okay, I think the joke is only funny

1:33:19.580 --> 1:33:21.520
 if you say it before now.

1:33:21.520 --> 1:33:23.480
 Right, yeah, that's true.

1:33:23.480 --> 1:33:24.440
 Like three years ago.

1:33:24.440 --> 1:33:25.920
 It's like, well, no, obviously concerts are still a big thing.

1:33:25.920 --> 1:33:27.920
 I'll wait to publish this until we have a vaccine.

1:33:27.920 --> 1:33:30.360
 No, you know, we'll fix it in post.

1:33:30.360 --> 1:33:33.320
 But I think the important thing is.

1:33:33.320 --> 1:33:34.400
 Fix the virus post.

1:33:34.400 --> 1:33:36.060
 Concerts changed, right?

1:33:36.960 --> 1:33:37.800
 Concerts changed.

1:33:37.800 --> 1:33:39.560
 First of all, movie theaters weren't this way, right?

1:33:39.560 --> 1:33:41.920
 In like the 60s and 70s, they weren't like this.

1:33:41.920 --> 1:33:44.000
 Like blockbusters were basically what?

1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:47.000
 Well, Jaws and Star Wars created blockbusters, right?

1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:47.840
 Before then, there weren't.

1:33:47.840 --> 1:33:49.740
 Like the whole shared summer experience

1:33:49.740 --> 1:33:52.320
 didn't exist in our lifetimes, right?

1:33:52.320 --> 1:33:53.760
 Certainly you were well into adulthood

1:33:53.760 --> 1:33:54.940
 by the time this was true, right?

1:33:54.940 --> 1:33:56.520
 So it's just a very different.

1:33:56.520 --> 1:33:57.360
 It's very different.

1:33:57.360 --> 1:33:59.480
 So what we've been experiencing in the last 10 years

1:33:59.480 --> 1:34:01.760
 is not like the majority of human history,

1:34:01.760 --> 1:34:03.480
 but more importantly, concerts, right?

1:34:03.480 --> 1:34:04.680
 Concerts mean something different.

1:34:04.680 --> 1:34:07.640
 Most people don't go to concerts anymore.

1:34:07.640 --> 1:34:09.640
 Like there's an age where you care about it.

1:34:09.640 --> 1:34:10.480
 You sort of stop doing it,

1:34:10.480 --> 1:34:12.240
 but you keep listening to music or whatever

1:34:12.240 --> 1:34:13.800
 and da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

1:34:13.800 --> 1:34:18.800
 So I think that's a painful way of saying that

1:34:21.100 --> 1:34:22.520
 it will change.

1:34:22.520 --> 1:34:23.840
 It was not the same thing as it going away.

1:34:23.840 --> 1:34:27.000
 Replace is too strong of a word, but it will change.

1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:27.840
 It has to.

1:34:27.840 --> 1:34:29.760
 Actually, like to push back, I wonder,

1:34:29.760 --> 1:34:31.880
 because I think you're probably just throwing

1:34:31.880 --> 1:34:33.160
 that your intuition now.

1:34:33.160 --> 1:34:34.200
 Oh, I wasn't.

1:34:34.200 --> 1:34:37.240
 And it's possible that concerts,

1:34:37.240 --> 1:34:39.620
 more people go to concerts now,

1:34:39.620 --> 1:34:42.720
 but obviously much more people listen to,

1:34:42.720 --> 1:34:46.920
 well, that's dumb, than before there was records.

1:34:46.920 --> 1:34:51.660
 It's possible to argue that if you look at the data,

1:34:51.660 --> 1:34:55.960
 that it just expanded the pie of what music listening means.

1:34:55.960 --> 1:34:59.400
 So it's possible that universities grow in the parallel

1:34:59.400 --> 1:35:00.680
 or the theaters grow,

1:35:00.680 --> 1:35:02.600
 but also more people get to watch movies,

1:35:02.600 --> 1:35:05.640
 more people get to be educated.

1:35:05.640 --> 1:35:07.040
 Yeah, I hope that is true.

1:35:07.040 --> 1:35:09.680
 Yeah, and to the extent that we can grow the pie

1:35:09.680 --> 1:35:11.960
 and have education be not just something you do

1:35:11.960 --> 1:35:16.400
 for four years when you're done with your other education,

1:35:16.400 --> 1:35:19.080
 but it be a more lifelong thing,

1:35:19.080 --> 1:35:20.600
 that would have tremendous benefits,

1:35:20.600 --> 1:35:24.480
 especially as the economy and the world change rapidly.

1:35:24.480 --> 1:35:28.880
 People need opportunities to stay abreast of these changes.

1:35:28.880 --> 1:35:30.680
 And so, I don't know,

1:35:31.720 --> 1:35:33.480
 that's all part of the ecosystem.

1:35:33.480 --> 1:35:34.320
 It's all to the good.

1:35:34.320 --> 1:35:36.880
 I mean, I'm not gonna have an argument

1:35:36.880 --> 1:35:38.920
 about whether we lost fidelity

1:35:38.920 --> 1:35:40.740
 when we went from Laserdisc to DVDs

1:35:40.740 --> 1:35:43.000
 or record players to CDs.

1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:45.580
 I mean, I'm willing to grant that that is true,

1:35:45.580 --> 1:35:50.580
 but convenience matters and the ability to do something

1:35:50.800 --> 1:35:51.720
 that you couldn't do otherwise

1:35:51.720 --> 1:35:53.760
 because that convenience matters.

1:35:53.760 --> 1:35:56.120
 And you can tell me I'm only getting 90% of the experience,

1:35:56.120 --> 1:35:57.720
 but I'm getting the experience.

1:35:57.720 --> 1:36:00.080
 I wasn't getting it before or it wasn't lasting as long

1:36:00.080 --> 1:36:00.920
 or it wasn't as easy.

1:36:00.920 --> 1:36:03.600
 I mean, this just seems straightforward to me.

1:36:03.600 --> 1:36:05.500
 It's gonna, it's going to change.

1:36:05.500 --> 1:36:08.240
 It is for the good that more people get access

1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:10.480
 and it is our job to do two separate things.

1:36:10.480 --> 1:36:13.440
 One, to educate them and make access available.

1:36:13.440 --> 1:36:14.700
 That's our mission.

1:36:14.700 --> 1:36:17.040
 But also for very simple selfish reasons,

1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:18.280
 we need to figure out how to do it better

1:36:18.280 --> 1:36:20.100
 so that we individually stay in business.

1:36:20.100 --> 1:36:21.840
 We can do both of those things at the same time.

1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:24.360
 They are not in, they may be intention,

1:36:24.360 --> 1:36:26.760
 but they are not mutually exclusive.

1:36:28.020 --> 1:36:32.120
 So you've educated some scary number of people.

1:36:34.960 --> 1:36:37.320
 So you've seen a lot of people succeed,

1:36:37.320 --> 1:36:39.520
 find their path through life.

1:36:39.520 --> 1:36:44.200
 Is there a device that you can give to a young person today

1:36:45.280 --> 1:36:48.960
 about computer science education,

1:36:48.960 --> 1:36:53.320
 about education in general, about life,

1:36:53.320 --> 1:36:58.320
 about whatever the journey that one takes in there,

1:36:59.480 --> 1:37:02.600
 maybe in their teens, in their early 20s,

1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:05.080
 sort of in those underground years

1:37:05.080 --> 1:37:09.120
 as you try to go through the essential process of partying

1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:10.740
 and not going to classes

1:37:10.740 --> 1:37:12.920
 and yet somehow trying to get a degree?

1:37:12.920 --> 1:37:16.420
 If you get to the point where you're far enough up

1:37:16.420 --> 1:37:20.240
 in the hierarchy of needs that you can actually

1:37:20.240 --> 1:37:21.880
 make decisions like this,

1:37:21.880 --> 1:37:24.460
 then find the thing that you're passionate about

1:37:24.460 --> 1:37:25.680
 and pursue it.

1:37:25.680 --> 1:37:27.820
 And sometimes it's the thing that drives your life

1:37:27.820 --> 1:37:29.040
 and sometimes it's secondary.

1:37:29.040 --> 1:37:31.600
 And you'll do other things because you've got to eat, right?

1:37:31.600 --> 1:37:32.800
 You've got a family, you've got to feed,

1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:34.480
 you've got people you have to help or whatever.

1:37:34.480 --> 1:37:36.360
 And I understand that and it's not easy for everyone,

1:37:36.360 --> 1:37:39.760
 but always take a moment or two

1:37:39.760 --> 1:37:42.520
 to pursue the things that you love,

1:37:42.520 --> 1:37:45.400
 the things that bring passion and happiness to your life.

1:37:45.400 --> 1:37:46.780
 And if you don't, I know that sounds corny,

1:37:46.780 --> 1:37:47.960
 but I genuinely believe it.

1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:49.880
 And if you don't have such a thing,

1:37:49.880 --> 1:37:51.380
 then you're lying to yourself.

1:37:51.380 --> 1:37:52.400
 You have such a thing.

1:37:52.400 --> 1:37:53.480
 You just have to find it.

1:37:53.480 --> 1:37:56.000
 And it's okay if it takes you a long time to get there.

1:37:56.000 --> 1:38:00.360
 Rodney Dangerfield became a comedian in his 50s, I think.

1:38:00.360 --> 1:38:01.760
 Certainly wasn't his 20s.

1:38:01.760 --> 1:38:03.660
 And lots of people failed for a very long time

1:38:03.660 --> 1:38:05.660
 before getting to where they were going.

1:38:06.680 --> 1:38:09.740
 I try to have hope and it wasn't obvious.

1:38:09.740 --> 1:38:13.760
 I mean, you and I talked about the experience that I had

1:38:13.760 --> 1:38:17.480
 a long time ago with a particular police officer.

1:38:17.480 --> 1:38:20.920
 Was it my first one and was it my last one?

1:38:20.920 --> 1:38:24.160
 But in my view, I wasn't supposed to be here after that

1:38:24.160 --> 1:38:25.000
 and I'm here.

1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:25.920
 So it's all gravy.

1:38:25.920 --> 1:38:29.000
 So you might as well go ahead and grab life as you can

1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:29.840
 because of that.

1:38:29.840 --> 1:38:31.200
 That's sort of how I see it.

1:38:31.200 --> 1:38:34.480
 While recognizing, again, the delusion matters, right?

1:38:34.480 --> 1:38:35.880
 Allow yourself to be deluded.

1:38:35.880 --> 1:38:38.060
 Allow yourself to believe that it's all gonna work out.

1:38:38.060 --> 1:38:41.700
 Just don't be so deluded that you miss the obvious.

1:38:41.700 --> 1:38:43.440
 And you're gonna be fine.

1:38:43.440 --> 1:38:44.860
 It's gonna be there.

1:38:44.860 --> 1:38:45.700
 It's gonna be there.

1:38:45.700 --> 1:38:46.600
 It's gonna work out.

1:38:46.600 --> 1:38:47.980
 What do you think?

1:38:47.980 --> 1:38:50.080
 I like to say choose your parents wisely

1:38:51.120 --> 1:38:53.120
 because that has a big impact on your life.

1:38:53.120 --> 1:38:54.560
 It's different.

1:38:54.560 --> 1:38:57.360
 Yeah, I mean, there's a whole lot of things

1:38:57.360 --> 1:38:58.440
 that you don't get to pick.

1:38:58.440 --> 1:39:02.920
 And whether you get to have one kind of life

1:39:02.920 --> 1:39:05.080
 or a different kind of life can depend a lot

1:39:05.080 --> 1:39:06.840
 on things out of your control.

1:39:06.840 --> 1:39:09.960
 But I really do believe in the passion, excitement thing.

1:39:09.960 --> 1:39:11.920
 My, I was talking to my mom on the phone the other day

1:39:11.920 --> 1:39:16.920
 and essentially what came out is that computer science

1:39:19.840 --> 1:39:22.080
 is really popular right now.

1:39:22.080 --> 1:39:25.880
 And I get to be a professor teaching something

1:39:25.880 --> 1:39:28.840
 that's very attractive to people.

1:39:28.840 --> 1:39:33.560
 And she was like trying to give me some appreciation

1:39:33.560 --> 1:39:37.680
 for how foresightful I was for choosing this line of work

1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:40.000
 as if somehow I knew that this is what was gonna happen

1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:44.020
 in 2020, but that's not how it went for me at all.

1:39:44.020 --> 1:39:45.540
 Like I studied computer science

1:39:45.540 --> 1:39:47.900
 because I was just interested.

1:39:47.900 --> 1:39:49.600
 It was just so interesting to me.

1:39:49.600 --> 1:39:54.600
 I didn't think it would be particularly lucrative.

1:39:54.600 --> 1:39:56.480
 And I've done everything I've can to keep it

1:39:56.480 --> 1:39:58.380
 as unlucrative as possible.

1:39:59.480 --> 1:40:03.600
 Some of my friends and colleagues have not done that.

1:40:03.600 --> 1:40:07.880
 And I pride myself on my ability to remain unrich.

1:40:07.880 --> 1:40:12.880
 But I do believe that, like I'm glad.

1:40:13.300 --> 1:40:15.240
 I mean, I'm glad that it worked out for me.

1:40:15.240 --> 1:40:17.920
 It could have been like, oh, what I was really fascinated by

1:40:17.920 --> 1:40:19.300
 is this particular kind of engraving

1:40:19.300 --> 1:40:20.680
 that nobody cares about.

1:40:20.680 --> 1:40:22.800
 But so I got lucky and the thing that I cared about

1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:24.120
 happened to be a thing that other people

1:40:24.120 --> 1:40:25.320
 eventually cared about.

1:40:26.300 --> 1:40:28.080
 But I don't think I would have had a fun time

1:40:28.080 --> 1:40:29.180
 choosing anything else.

1:40:29.180 --> 1:40:32.720
 Like this was the thing that kept me interested and engaged.

1:40:32.720 --> 1:40:34.720
 Well, one thing that people tell me,

1:40:34.720 --> 1:40:38.200
 especially around the early undergraduate,

1:40:38.200 --> 1:40:41.560
 and the internet is part of the problem here,

1:40:41.560 --> 1:40:44.840
 is they say they're passionate about so many things.

1:40:44.840 --> 1:40:46.520
 How do I choose a thing?

1:40:46.520 --> 1:40:50.280
 Which is a harder thing for me to know what to do with.

1:40:50.280 --> 1:40:51.360
 Is there any?

1:40:51.360 --> 1:40:54.400
 I mean, don't you know which, I mean, you know, look.

1:40:55.680 --> 1:40:57.720
 A long time ago, I walked down a hallway

1:40:57.720 --> 1:40:59.020
 and I took a left turn.

1:40:59.020 --> 1:40:59.860
 Yeah.

1:40:59.860 --> 1:41:01.320
 I could have taken a right turn.

1:41:01.320 --> 1:41:03.800
 And my world could be better or it could be worse.

1:41:03.800 --> 1:41:04.640
 I have no idea.

1:41:04.640 --> 1:41:05.460
 I have no way of knowing.

1:41:05.460 --> 1:41:07.080
 Is there anything about this particular hallway

1:41:07.080 --> 1:41:09.080
 that's relevant or you're just in general choices?

1:41:09.080 --> 1:41:09.920
 Yeah, you were on the left.

1:41:09.920 --> 1:41:11.880
 It sounds like you regret not taking the right turn.

1:41:11.880 --> 1:41:12.800
 Oh no, not at all.

1:41:12.800 --> 1:41:13.920
 You brought it up.

1:41:13.920 --> 1:41:16.460
 Well, because there was a turn there.

1:41:16.460 --> 1:41:18.080
 On the left was Michael Newman's office, right?

1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:20.080
 I mean, these sorts of things happen, right?

1:41:20.080 --> 1:41:20.920
 But here's the thing.

1:41:20.920 --> 1:41:22.640
 On the right, by the way, there was just a blank wall.

1:41:22.640 --> 1:41:24.480
 It wasn't a huge choice.

1:41:24.480 --> 1:41:25.320
 It would have really hurt.

1:41:25.320 --> 1:41:26.280
 He tried first.

1:41:26.280 --> 1:41:27.840
 No, but it's true, right?

1:41:27.840 --> 1:41:29.840
 You know, I think about Ron Brockman, right?

1:41:29.840 --> 1:41:33.320
 I went, I took a trip I wasn't supposed to take

1:41:33.320 --> 1:41:38.100
 and I ended up talking to Ron about this

1:41:38.100 --> 1:41:40.720
 and I ended up going down this entire path

1:41:40.720 --> 1:41:42.840
 that allowed me to, I think, get tenure.

1:41:42.840 --> 1:41:45.840
 But by the way, I decided to say yes to something

1:41:45.840 --> 1:41:46.740
 that didn't make any sense

1:41:46.740 --> 1:41:48.260
 and I went down this educational path.

1:41:48.260 --> 1:41:50.480
 But it would have been, you know, who knows, right?

1:41:50.480 --> 1:41:52.120
 Maybe if I hadn't done that,

1:41:52.120 --> 1:41:54.320
 I would be a billionaire right now.

1:41:54.320 --> 1:41:55.320
 I'd be Elon Musk.

1:41:55.320 --> 1:41:57.020
 My life could be so much better.

1:41:57.020 --> 1:41:59.560
 My life could also be so much worse.

1:41:59.560 --> 1:42:01.600
 You know, you just gotta feel that sometimes

1:42:01.600 --> 1:42:03.020
 you have decisions you're gonna make.

1:42:03.020 --> 1:42:04.200
 You cannot know what's gonna do.

1:42:04.200 --> 1:42:05.600
 You should think about it, right?

1:42:05.600 --> 1:42:07.520
 Some things are clearly smarter than other things.

1:42:07.520 --> 1:42:09.560
 You gotta play the odds a little bit.

1:42:09.560 --> 1:42:11.600
 But in the end, if you've got multiple choices,

1:42:11.600 --> 1:42:12.840
 there are lots of things you think you might love.

1:42:12.840 --> 1:42:14.420
 Go with the thing that you actually love,

1:42:14.420 --> 1:42:15.920
 the thing that jumps out at you

1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:17.280
 and sort of pursue it for a little while.

1:42:17.280 --> 1:42:18.960
 The worst thing that'll happen is you took a left turn

1:42:18.960 --> 1:42:21.720
 instead of a right turn and you ended up merely happy.

1:42:22.640 --> 1:42:23.580
 Beautiful.

1:42:23.580 --> 1:42:26.620
 So, so accepting, so taking the step

1:42:26.620 --> 1:42:28.480
 and just accepting, accepting that,

1:42:28.480 --> 1:42:31.200
 that don't like question, question the choice.

1:42:31.200 --> 1:42:36.200
 Life is long and there's time to actually pursue.

1:42:36.600 --> 1:42:41.160
 Every once in a while, you have to put on a leather suit

1:42:41.160 --> 1:42:43.040
 and make a thriller video.

1:42:43.040 --> 1:42:44.280
 Every once in a while.

1:42:44.280 --> 1:42:47.360
 If I ever get the chance again, I'm doing it.

1:42:47.360 --> 1:42:48.200
 Yeah.

1:42:49.080 --> 1:42:50.960
 I was told that you actually dance,

1:42:50.960 --> 1:42:53.800
 but that part was edited out.

1:42:53.800 --> 1:42:54.640
 I don't dance.

1:42:55.760 --> 1:42:59.160
 There was a thing where we did do the zombie thing.

1:42:59.160 --> 1:43:00.640
 We did do the zombie thing.

1:43:00.640 --> 1:43:01.920
 That wasn't edited out.

1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:04.220
 It just wasn't put into the final thing.

1:43:05.540 --> 1:43:06.380
 I'm quite happy.

1:43:06.380 --> 1:43:07.520
 There was a reason for that too, right?

1:43:07.520 --> 1:43:09.480
 Like I wasn't wearing something right.

1:43:09.480 --> 1:43:10.320
 There was a reason for that.

1:43:10.320 --> 1:43:11.160
 I can't remember what it was.

1:43:11.160 --> 1:43:12.360
 No leather suit.

1:43:12.360 --> 1:43:13.200
 Is that what it was?

1:43:13.200 --> 1:43:14.020
 I can't remember.

1:43:14.020 --> 1:43:16.040
 Anyway, the right thing happened.

1:43:16.040 --> 1:43:16.880
 Exactly.

1:43:16.880 --> 1:43:19.600
 You took the left turn and ended up being the right thing.

1:43:19.600 --> 1:43:23.120
 So a lot of people ask me that are a little bit

1:43:23.120 --> 1:43:26.480
 tangential to the programming and the computing world

1:43:26.480 --> 1:43:28.280
 and they're interested to learn programming,

1:43:28.280 --> 1:43:30.360
 like all kinds of disciplines that are outside

1:43:30.360 --> 1:43:33.240
 of the particular discipline of computer science.

1:43:33.240 --> 1:43:36.080
 What advice do you have for people

1:43:36.080 --> 1:43:38.080
 that want to learn how to program

1:43:38.080 --> 1:43:43.080
 or want to either taste this little skill set

1:43:43.600 --> 1:43:47.240
 or discipline or try to see if it can be used somehow

1:43:47.240 --> 1:43:48.880
 in their own life?

1:43:48.880 --> 1:43:50.480
 What stage of life are they in?

1:43:53.040 --> 1:43:55.040
 One of the magic things about the internet

1:43:55.040 --> 1:43:58.160
 of the people that write me is I don't know.

1:43:58.160 --> 1:44:00.520
 Because my answer's different for, my daughter

1:44:00.520 --> 1:44:02.480
 is taking AP computer science right now.

1:44:02.480 --> 1:44:03.560
 Hi, Joni.

1:44:03.560 --> 1:44:06.340
 She's amazing and doing amazing things

1:44:06.340 --> 1:44:08.040
 and my son's beginning to get interested

1:44:08.040 --> 1:44:10.280
 and I'll be really curious where he takes it.

1:44:10.280 --> 1:44:12.400
 I think his mind actually works very well

1:44:12.400 --> 1:44:14.680
 for this sort of thing and she's doing great.

1:44:14.680 --> 1:44:17.280
 But one of the things I have to tell her all the time,

1:44:17.280 --> 1:44:19.880
 she points, well, I want to make a rhythm game.

1:44:19.880 --> 1:44:23.320
 So I want to go for two weeks and then build a rhythm game.

1:44:23.320 --> 1:44:25.240
 Show me how to build a rhythm game.

1:44:25.240 --> 1:44:27.800
 Start small, learn the building blocks

1:44:27.800 --> 1:44:28.920
 and how to take the time.

1:44:28.920 --> 1:44:31.100
 Have patience, eventually you'll build a rhythm game.

1:44:31.100 --> 1:44:34.100
 I was in grad school when I suddenly woke up one day

1:44:34.100 --> 1:44:37.200
 over the Royal East and I thought, wait a minute,

1:44:37.200 --> 1:44:38.040
 I'm a computer scientist.

1:44:38.040 --> 1:44:39.740
 I should be able to write Pac Man in an afternoon.

1:44:39.740 --> 1:44:42.040
 And I did, not with great graphics.

1:44:42.040 --> 1:44:43.120
 It was actually a very cool game.

1:44:43.120 --> 1:44:45.120
 I had to figure out how the ghost moved and everything

1:44:45.120 --> 1:44:47.320
 and I did it in an afternoon in Pascal

1:44:47.320 --> 1:44:48.800
 on an old Apple 2GS.

1:44:49.920 --> 1:44:52.440
 But if I had started out trying to build Pac Man,

1:44:52.440 --> 1:44:55.040
 I think it probably would have ended very poorly for me.

1:44:55.040 --> 1:44:57.160
 Luckily back then, there weren't

1:44:57.160 --> 1:44:58.920
 these magical devices we call phones

1:44:58.920 --> 1:45:01.160
 and software everywhere to give me this illusion

1:45:01.160 --> 1:45:03.480
 that I could create something by myself

1:45:03.480 --> 1:45:05.760
 from the basics inside of a weekend like that.

1:45:05.760 --> 1:45:09.440
 I mean, that was a culmination of years and years and years

1:45:09.440 --> 1:45:11.200
 right before I decided, oh, I should be able to write this

1:45:11.200 --> 1:45:12.140
 and I could.

1:45:12.140 --> 1:45:16.920
 So my advice if you're early on is you've got the internet.

1:45:16.920 --> 1:45:18.840
 There are lots of people there to give you the information.

1:45:18.840 --> 1:45:20.540
 Find someone who cares about this.

1:45:20.540 --> 1:45:22.640
 Remember, they've been doing it for a very long time.

1:45:22.640 --> 1:45:25.660
 Take it slow, learn the little pieces, get excited about it

1:45:25.660 --> 1:45:28.520
 and then keep the big project you want to build in mind.

1:45:28.520 --> 1:45:29.640
 You'll get there soon enough.

1:45:29.640 --> 1:45:32.820
 Because as a wise man once said, life is long.

1:45:32.820 --> 1:45:35.640
 Sometimes it doesn't seem that long, but it is long

1:45:35.640 --> 1:45:39.120
 and you'll have enough time to build it all out.

1:45:39.120 --> 1:45:42.060
 All the information is out there, but start small.

1:45:43.280 --> 1:45:44.720
 Generate Fibonacci numbers.

1:45:44.720 --> 1:45:48.680
 That's not exciting, but it'll get you the language.

1:45:48.680 --> 1:45:50.960
 Well, there's only one programming language, it's Lisp.

1:45:50.960 --> 1:45:53.560
 But if you have to pick a programming language,

1:45:53.560 --> 1:45:55.480
 I guess in today's day, what would I do?

1:45:55.480 --> 1:45:56.800
 I guess I'd do.

1:45:56.800 --> 1:46:00.600
 Python is basically Lisp, but with better syntax.

1:46:00.600 --> 1:46:01.440
 Blasphemy.

1:46:01.440 --> 1:46:03.800
 Yeah, with C syntax, how about that?

1:46:03.800 --> 1:46:05.280
 So you're gonna argue that C syntax

1:46:05.280 --> 1:46:07.080
 is better than anything?

1:46:07.080 --> 1:46:10.200
 Anyway, also I'm gonna answer Python despite what he said.

1:46:10.200 --> 1:46:12.560
 Tell your story about somebody's dissertation

1:46:12.560 --> 1:46:14.640
 that had a Lisp program in it.

1:46:14.640 --> 1:46:15.480
 It was so funny.

1:46:15.480 --> 1:46:17.920
 This is Dave's, Dave's dissertation was like,

1:46:17.920 --> 1:46:20.120
 Dave McAllister, who was a professor at MIT for a while

1:46:20.120 --> 1:46:24.120
 and then he came to Bell Labs and now he's at

1:46:24.120 --> 1:46:26.360
 Technology Technical Institute of Chicago.

1:46:26.360 --> 1:46:27.920
 A brilliant guy.

1:46:27.920 --> 1:46:28.880
 Such an interesting guy.

1:46:28.880 --> 1:46:33.880
 Anyway, his thesis, it was a theorem prover

1:46:33.920 --> 1:46:38.400
 and he decided to have as an appendix his actual code,

1:46:38.400 --> 1:46:39.640
 which of course was all written in Lisp

1:46:39.640 --> 1:46:40.920
 because of course it was.

1:46:40.920 --> 1:46:43.680
 And like the last 20 pages are just right parenthesis.

1:46:43.680 --> 1:46:47.120
 It's just wonderful.

1:46:47.120 --> 1:46:48.720
 That's programming right there.

1:46:48.720 --> 1:46:51.000
 Pages upon pages of right parenthesis.

1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:52.860
 Anyway, Lisp is the only real language,

1:46:52.860 --> 1:46:54.400
 but I understand that that's not necessarily

1:46:54.400 --> 1:46:56.000
 the place where you start.

1:46:56.000 --> 1:46:57.720
 Python is just fine.

1:46:57.720 --> 1:46:59.000
 Python is good.

1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:00.680
 If you're, you know, of a certain age,

1:47:00.680 --> 1:47:02.260
 if you're really young and trying to figure it out,

1:47:02.260 --> 1:47:04.000
 graphical languages that let you kind of see

1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:05.920
 how the thing works and that's fine too.

1:47:05.920 --> 1:47:06.760
 They're all fine.

1:47:06.760 --> 1:47:07.580
 It almost doesn't matter.

1:47:07.580 --> 1:47:09.000
 But there are people who spend a lot of time

1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:13.040
 thinking about how to build languages that get people in.

1:47:13.040 --> 1:47:14.840
 The question is, are you trying to get in

1:47:14.840 --> 1:47:15.880
 and figure out what it is?

1:47:15.880 --> 1:47:18.160
 Or do you already know what you want?

1:47:18.160 --> 1:47:19.920
 And that's why I asked you what stage of life people are in

1:47:19.920 --> 1:47:21.200
 because if you're different stages of life,

1:47:21.200 --> 1:47:23.360
 you would attack it differently.

1:47:23.360 --> 1:47:25.360
 The answer to that question of which language

1:47:25.360 --> 1:47:27.960
 keeps changing, I mean, there's some value

1:47:27.960 --> 1:47:32.960
 to exploring, a lot of people write to me about Julia.

1:47:33.080 --> 1:47:35.240
 There's these like more modern languages

1:47:35.240 --> 1:47:39.080
 that keep being invented, Rust and Kotlin.

1:47:39.080 --> 1:47:42.280
 There's stuff that, for people who love

1:47:42.280 --> 1:47:44.880
 functional languages like Lisp,

1:47:44.880 --> 1:47:46.920
 that apparently there's echoes of that,

1:47:46.920 --> 1:47:49.400
 but much better in the modern languages.

1:47:49.400 --> 1:47:51.720
 And it's worthwhile to,

1:47:51.720 --> 1:47:53.360
 especially when you're learning languages,

1:47:53.360 --> 1:47:55.320
 it feels like it's okay to try one

1:47:55.320 --> 1:47:57.840
 that's not like the popular one.

1:47:57.840 --> 1:47:59.160
 Oh yeah, but you want something simple.

1:47:59.160 --> 1:48:02.180
 And I think you get that way of thinking

1:48:02.180 --> 1:48:04.500
 almost no matter what language.

1:48:04.500 --> 1:48:06.520
 And if you push far enough,

1:48:06.520 --> 1:48:08.040
 like it can be assembly language,

1:48:08.040 --> 1:48:09.560
 but you need to push pretty far

1:48:09.560 --> 1:48:11.520
 before you start to hit the really deep concepts

1:48:11.520 --> 1:48:13.400
 that you would get sooner in other languages.

1:48:13.400 --> 1:48:16.600
 But like, I don't know, computation is kind of computation,

1:48:16.600 --> 1:48:19.520
 is kind of Turing equivalent, is kind of computation.

1:48:19.520 --> 1:48:22.220
 And so it matters how you express things,

1:48:22.220 --> 1:48:24.440
 but you have to build out that mental structure

1:48:24.440 --> 1:48:25.440
 in your mind.

1:48:25.440 --> 1:48:28.800
 And I don't think it's super matters which language.

1:48:28.800 --> 1:48:29.940
 I mean, it matters a little,

1:48:29.940 --> 1:48:31.000
 because some things are just

1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:32.240
 at the wrong level of abstraction.

1:48:32.240 --> 1:48:33.840
 I think assembly is at the wrong level of abstraction

1:48:33.840 --> 1:48:35.920
 for someone coming in new.

1:48:35.920 --> 1:48:37.360
 I think that if you start.

1:48:37.360 --> 1:48:38.400
 For someone coming in new.

1:48:38.400 --> 1:48:42.640
 Yes, for frameworks, big frameworks are quite a bit.

1:48:42.640 --> 1:48:43.640
 You know, you've got to get to the point

1:48:43.640 --> 1:48:44.940
 where I want to learn a new language,

1:48:44.940 --> 1:48:46.180
 means I just pick up a reference book

1:48:46.180 --> 1:48:49.240
 and I think of a project and I go through it in a weekend.

1:48:49.240 --> 1:48:50.320
 Right, you got to get there.

1:48:50.320 --> 1:48:52.400
 You're right though, the languages that are designed

1:48:52.400 --> 1:48:54.920
 for that are, it almost doesn't matter.

1:48:54.920 --> 1:48:57.800
 Pick the ones that people have built tutorials

1:48:57.800 --> 1:48:59.760
 and infrastructure around to help you get kind of,

1:48:59.760 --> 1:49:00.840
 kind of ease into it.

1:49:00.840 --> 1:49:01.680
 Because it's hard.

1:49:01.680 --> 1:49:03.480
 I mean, I did this little experiment once.

1:49:05.300 --> 1:49:08.560
 I was teaching intro to CS in the summer as a favor.

1:49:11.080 --> 1:49:11.920
 Which is, anyway.

1:49:11.920 --> 1:49:12.760
 I was teaching.

1:49:12.760 --> 1:49:15.120
 I was teaching intro to CS as a favor.

1:49:15.120 --> 1:49:17.000
 And it was very funny because I'd go in every single time

1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:18.800
 and I would think to myself,

1:49:18.800 --> 1:49:21.560
 how am I possibly going to fill up an hour and a half

1:49:21.560 --> 1:49:23.120
 talking about for loops, right?

1:49:23.120 --> 1:49:25.240
 And there wasn't enough time.

1:49:25.240 --> 1:49:26.660
 Took me a while to realize this, right?

1:49:26.660 --> 1:49:27.920
 There are only three things, right?

1:49:27.920 --> 1:49:29.120
 There's reading from a variable,

1:49:29.120 --> 1:49:31.580
 writing to a variable and conditional branching.

1:49:31.580 --> 1:49:34.100
 Everything else is syntactic sugar, right?

1:49:34.100 --> 1:49:36.080
 The syntactic sugar matters, but that's it.

1:49:36.080 --> 1:49:38.960
 And when I say that's it, I don't mean it's simple.

1:49:38.960 --> 1:49:40.120
 I mean, it's hard.

1:49:40.120 --> 1:49:43.480
 Like conditional branching, loops, variable.

1:49:43.480 --> 1:49:45.200
 Those are really hard concepts.

1:49:45.200 --> 1:49:47.240
 So you shouldn't be discouraged by this.

1:49:47.240 --> 1:49:48.080
 Here's a simple experiment.

1:49:48.080 --> 1:49:49.280
 I'm gonna ask you a question now.

1:49:49.280 --> 1:49:50.720
 You ready?

1:49:50.720 --> 1:49:51.680
 X equals three.

1:49:51.680 --> 1:49:52.520
 Okay.

1:49:53.440 --> 1:49:54.960
 Y equals four.

1:49:54.960 --> 1:49:55.800
 Okay.

1:49:55.800 --> 1:49:57.080
 What is X?

1:49:57.080 --> 1:49:57.920
 Three.

1:49:57.920 --> 1:49:59.040
 What is Y?

1:49:59.040 --> 1:49:59.880
 Four.

1:49:59.880 --> 1:50:00.700
 Y equals X.

1:50:00.700 --> 1:50:01.540
 I'm gonna mess this up.

1:50:01.540 --> 1:50:02.620
 No, it's easy.

1:50:02.620 --> 1:50:04.020
 Y equals X.

1:50:04.020 --> 1:50:04.860
 Y equals X.

1:50:04.860 --> 1:50:05.680
 What is Y?

1:50:07.880 --> 1:50:08.720
 Three.

1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:09.560
 That's right.

1:50:09.560 --> 1:50:10.380
 X equals seven.

1:50:11.360 --> 1:50:12.520
 What is Y?

1:50:12.520 --> 1:50:15.540
 That's one of the trickiest things to get for programmers,

1:50:15.540 --> 1:50:19.240
 that there's a memory and the variables are pointing

1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:21.040
 to a particular thing in memory,

1:50:21.040 --> 1:50:23.240
 and sometimes the languages hide that from you

1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:24.360
 and they bring it closer

1:50:24.360 --> 1:50:26.640
 to the way you think mathematics works.

1:50:26.640 --> 1:50:28.480
 Right, so in fact, Mark Guzdal,

1:50:28.480 --> 1:50:30.040
 who worries about these sorts of things,

1:50:30.040 --> 1:50:32.440
 or used to worry about these sorts of things anyway,

1:50:32.440 --> 1:50:35.560
 had this kind of belief that actually,

1:50:35.560 --> 1:50:36.960
 people when they see these statements,

1:50:36.960 --> 1:50:39.560
 X equals something, Y equals something, Y equals X,

1:50:39.560 --> 1:50:42.900
 that you have now made a mathematical statement

1:50:42.900 --> 1:50:44.200
 that Y and X are the same.

1:50:45.580 --> 1:50:48.080
 Which you can if you just put like an anchor in front of it.

1:50:48.080 --> 1:50:51.400
 Yes, but people, that's not what you're doing, right?

1:50:51.400 --> 1:50:54.040
 I thought, and I kind of asked the question,

1:50:54.040 --> 1:50:55.480
 and I think I had some evidence for this,

1:50:55.480 --> 1:50:56.600
 it's hardly a study,

1:50:56.600 --> 1:50:59.240
 is that most of the people who didn't know the answer,

1:50:59.240 --> 1:51:02.240
 weren't sure about the answer, they had used spreadsheets.

1:51:02.240 --> 1:51:03.480
 Ah, interesting.

1:51:03.480 --> 1:51:06.380
 And so it's, you know,

1:51:06.380 --> 1:51:10.920
 it's by reference, or by name really, right?

1:51:10.920 --> 1:51:13.280
 And so depending upon what you think they are,

1:51:13.280 --> 1:51:14.720
 you get completely different answers.

1:51:14.720 --> 1:51:17.860
 The fact that I could go, or one could go,

1:51:17.860 --> 1:51:20.120
 two thirds of the way through a semester,

1:51:20.120 --> 1:51:22.560
 and people still hadn't figured out in their heads,

1:51:22.560 --> 1:51:25.080
 when you say Y equals X, what that meant,

1:51:25.080 --> 1:51:27.100
 tells you it's actually hard.

1:51:27.100 --> 1:51:29.080
 Because all those answers are possible,

1:51:29.080 --> 1:51:30.100
 and in fact, when you said,

1:51:30.100 --> 1:51:31.800
 oh, if you just put an ampersand in front of it,

1:51:31.800 --> 1:51:33.680
 I mean, that doesn't make any sense for an intro class,

1:51:33.680 --> 1:51:34.720
 and of course a lot of languages

1:51:34.720 --> 1:51:35.720
 don't even give you the ability

1:51:35.720 --> 1:51:37.320
 to think about it in terms of ampersand.

1:51:37.320 --> 1:51:38.920
 Do we want to have a 45 minute discussion

1:51:38.920 --> 1:51:42.360
 about the difference between equal EQ and equal in Lisp?

1:51:42.360 --> 1:51:43.200
 Yeah.

1:51:43.200 --> 1:51:44.020
 I know you do.

1:51:44.020 --> 1:51:44.860
 No.

1:51:44.860 --> 1:51:47.440
 But you know, you could do that.

1:51:47.440 --> 1:51:49.160
 This is actually really hard stuff.

1:51:49.160 --> 1:51:52.360
 So you shouldn't be, it's not too hard, we all do it,

1:51:52.360 --> 1:51:53.920
 but you shouldn't be discouraged.

1:51:53.920 --> 1:51:55.320
 It's why you should start small,

1:51:55.320 --> 1:51:56.600
 so that you can figure out these things,

1:51:56.600 --> 1:51:58.380
 so you have the right model in your head,

1:51:58.380 --> 1:51:59.960
 so that when you write the language,

1:51:59.960 --> 1:52:02.020
 you can execute it, and build the machine

1:52:02.020 --> 1:52:03.280
 that you want to build, right?

1:52:03.280 --> 1:52:05.200
 Yeah, the funny thing about programming,

1:52:05.200 --> 1:52:06.960
 and those very basic things,

1:52:06.960 --> 1:52:11.160
 is the very basics are not often made explicit,

1:52:11.160 --> 1:52:13.880
 which is actually what drives everybody away

1:52:13.880 --> 1:52:15.320
 from basically any discipline,

1:52:15.320 --> 1:52:17.040
 but programming is just another one.

1:52:17.040 --> 1:52:19.360
 Like even a simpler version of the equal sign

1:52:19.360 --> 1:52:23.740
 that I kind of forget, is in mathematics,

1:52:23.740 --> 1:52:25.480
 equals is not assignment.

1:52:25.480 --> 1:52:26.520
 Yeah.

1:52:26.520 --> 1:52:30.260
 Like, I think basically every single programming language

1:52:30.260 --> 1:52:33.080
 with just a few handful of exceptions,

1:52:33.080 --> 1:52:35.160
 equals is assignment.

1:52:35.160 --> 1:52:38.840
 And you have some other operator for equality.

1:52:38.840 --> 1:52:41.740
 And even that, like everyone kind of knows it,

1:52:42.640 --> 1:52:45.020
 once you started doing it,

1:52:45.020 --> 1:52:47.120
 but like you need to say that explicitly,

1:52:47.120 --> 1:52:51.000
 or you just realize it, like yourself.

1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:53.240
 Otherwise you might be stuck for,

1:52:53.240 --> 1:52:54.680
 you said like half a semester,

1:52:54.680 --> 1:52:57.160
 you could be stuck for quite a long time.

1:52:57.160 --> 1:53:00.320
 And I think also part of the programming

1:53:00.320 --> 1:53:04.520
 is being okay in that state of confusion for a while.

1:53:04.520 --> 1:53:06.720
 It's to the debugging point.

1:53:06.720 --> 1:53:09.800
 It's like, I just wrote two lines of code,

1:53:09.800 --> 1:53:10.980
 why doesn't this work?

1:53:10.980 --> 1:53:13.400
 And staring at that for like hours,

1:53:14.640 --> 1:53:15.800
 and trying to figure out.

1:53:15.800 --> 1:53:16.960
 And then every once in a while,

1:53:16.960 --> 1:53:18.480
 you just have to restart your computer

1:53:18.480 --> 1:53:19.540
 and everything works again.

1:53:19.540 --> 1:53:24.200
 And then you just kind of stare into the void

1:53:24.200 --> 1:53:26.600
 with the tear slowly rolling down your eye.

1:53:26.600 --> 1:53:28.200
 By the way, the fact that they didn't get this

1:53:28.200 --> 1:53:30.000
 actually had no impact on,

1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:32.360
 I mean, they were still able to do their assignments.

1:53:32.360 --> 1:53:35.080
 Because it turns out their misunderstanding

1:53:35.080 --> 1:53:37.600
 wasn't being revealed to them

1:53:37.600 --> 1:53:39.840
 by the problem sets we were giving them.

1:53:39.840 --> 1:53:41.360
 It's pretty profound actually, yeah.

1:53:41.360 --> 1:53:44.400
 I wrote a program a long time ago,

1:53:44.400 --> 1:53:46.360
 actually for my master's thesis,

1:53:46.360 --> 1:53:49.400
 and in C++ I think, or C, I guess it was C.

1:53:49.400 --> 1:53:51.720
 And it was all memory management and terrible.

1:53:52.720 --> 1:53:55.440
 And it wouldn't work for a while.

1:53:56.320 --> 1:53:57.480
 And it was some kind of,

1:53:57.480 --> 1:53:59.680
 it was clear to me that it was overriding memory.

1:53:59.680 --> 1:54:01.400
 And I just couldn't, I was like,

1:54:01.400 --> 1:54:03.360
 look, I got to pay for this time for this.

1:54:03.360 --> 1:54:06.560
 So I basically declared a variable

1:54:06.560 --> 1:54:10.160
 at the front in the main that was like 400K,

1:54:10.160 --> 1:54:12.480
 just an array, and it worked.

1:54:12.480 --> 1:54:14.340
 Because wherever I was scribbling over memory,

1:54:14.340 --> 1:54:17.120
 it would scribble into that space and it didn't matter.

1:54:17.120 --> 1:54:19.640
 And so I never figured out what the bug was.

1:54:19.640 --> 1:54:21.840
 But I did create something to sort of deal with it.

1:54:21.840 --> 1:54:22.720
 To work around it.

1:54:22.720 --> 1:54:25.640
 And it, you know, that's crazy, that's crazy.

1:54:25.640 --> 1:54:27.240
 It was okay, because that's what I wanted.

1:54:27.240 --> 1:54:29.320
 But I knew enough about memory managed to go,

1:54:29.320 --> 1:54:30.900
 you know, management to go, you know,

1:54:30.900 --> 1:54:32.240
 I'm just going to create an empty array here

1:54:32.240 --> 1:54:34.760
 and hope that that deals with this scribbling memory problem.

1:54:34.760 --> 1:54:35.600
 And it did.

1:54:35.600 --> 1:54:36.960
 That takes a long time to figure out.

1:54:36.960 --> 1:54:38.520
 And by the way, the language you first learned

1:54:38.520 --> 1:54:39.800
 probably just garbage collection anyway,

1:54:39.800 --> 1:54:41.080
 so you're not even going to come up across,

1:54:41.080 --> 1:54:43.500
 you're not going to come across that problem.

1:54:43.500 --> 1:54:46.080
 So we talked about the Minsky idea

1:54:46.080 --> 1:54:49.580
 of hating everything you do and hating yourself.

1:54:49.580 --> 1:54:52.600
 So let's end on a question

1:54:52.600 --> 1:54:54.760
 that's going to make both of you very uncomfortable.

1:54:54.760 --> 1:54:55.600
 Okay.

1:54:55.600 --> 1:54:58.000
 Which is, what is your, Charles,

1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:01.880
 what's your favorite thing that you're grateful for

1:55:01.880 --> 1:55:04.280
 about Michael?

1:55:04.280 --> 1:55:06.680
 And Michael, what is your favorite thing

1:55:06.680 --> 1:55:09.640
 that you're grateful for about Charles?

1:55:09.640 --> 1:55:12.120
 Well, that answer is actually quite easy.

1:55:12.120 --> 1:55:12.940
 His friendship.

1:55:14.480 --> 1:55:15.320
 He stole the easy answer.

1:55:15.320 --> 1:55:16.160
 I did.

1:55:16.160 --> 1:55:17.400
 Yeah, I can tell you what I hate about Charles,

1:55:17.400 --> 1:55:19.440
 he steals my good answers.

1:55:19.440 --> 1:55:21.120
 The thing I like most about Charles,

1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:24.080
 he sees the world in a similar enough,

1:55:24.080 --> 1:55:25.720
 but different way that I,

1:55:25.720 --> 1:55:28.880
 it's sort of like having another life.

1:55:28.880 --> 1:55:31.400
 It's sort of like I get to experience things

1:55:31.400 --> 1:55:32.920
 that I wouldn't otherwise get to experience

1:55:32.920 --> 1:55:36.040
 because I would not naturally gravitate to them that way.

1:55:36.040 --> 1:55:39.080
 And so he just, he just shows me a whole other world.

1:55:39.080 --> 1:55:39.920
 It's awesome.

1:55:39.920 --> 1:55:44.080
 Yeah, the inner product is not zero for sure.

1:55:44.080 --> 1:55:47.540
 It's not quite one, 0.7 maybe.

1:55:47.540 --> 1:55:49.320
 Just enough that you can learn.

1:55:50.720 --> 1:55:53.060
 Just enough that you can learn.

1:55:53.060 --> 1:55:54.320
 That's the definition of friendship.

1:55:54.320 --> 1:55:55.720
 The inner product is 0.7.

1:55:55.720 --> 1:55:56.680
 Yeah, I think so.

1:55:56.680 --> 1:55:58.120
 That's the answer to life really.

1:55:58.120 --> 1:55:59.360
 Charles sometimes believes in me

1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:01.360
 when I have not believed in me.

1:56:01.360 --> 1:56:04.360
 He also sometimes works as an outward confidence

1:56:04.360 --> 1:56:08.760
 that he has so much, so much confidence and self,

1:56:08.760 --> 1:56:11.360
 I don't know, comfortableness.

1:56:11.360 --> 1:56:13.000
 Okay, let's go with that.

1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:16.080
 That I feel better a little bit.

1:56:16.080 --> 1:56:17.680
 If he thinks I'm okay,

1:56:17.680 --> 1:56:20.240
 then maybe I'm not as bad as I think I am.

1:56:20.240 --> 1:56:24.620
 At the end of the day, luck favors the Charles.

1:56:24.620 --> 1:56:26.720
 It's a huge honor to talk with you.

1:56:26.720 --> 1:56:29.320
 Thank you so much for taking this time,

1:56:29.320 --> 1:56:30.740
 wasting your time with me.

1:56:30.740 --> 1:56:32.160
 It was an awesome conversation.

1:56:32.160 --> 1:56:35.240
 You guys are an inspiration to a huge number of people

1:56:35.240 --> 1:56:37.280
 and to me, so really enjoyed this.

1:56:37.280 --> 1:56:38.120
 Thanks for talking to me.

1:56:38.120 --> 1:56:38.940
 I enjoyed it as well.

1:56:38.940 --> 1:56:39.780
 Thank you so much.

1:56:39.780 --> 1:56:40.600
 And by the way, if luck favors the Charles,

1:56:40.600 --> 1:56:41.440
 then it's certainly the case

1:56:41.440 --> 1:56:43.840
 that I've been very lucky to know you.

1:56:43.840 --> 1:56:45.240
 I'm gonna edit that part out.

1:56:47.840 --> 1:56:49.360
