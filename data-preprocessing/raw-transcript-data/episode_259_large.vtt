00:00.000 --> 00:02.460
 The following is a conversation with Thomas Tall,

00:02.460 --> 00:04.700
 founder of Legendary Entertainment,

00:04.700 --> 00:06.820
 known for producing blockbusters

00:06.820 --> 00:09.140
 like Batman's Dark Knight Trilogy,

00:09.140 --> 00:12.300
 The Hangover franchise, Godzilla, Inception,

00:12.300 --> 00:15.700
 Jurassic World, 300, and many more.

00:15.700 --> 00:18.180
 He runs Tolko, which is an investment company

00:18.180 --> 00:21.040
 that focuses on how artificial intelligence

00:21.040 --> 00:23.820
 can revolutionize large industries.

00:23.820 --> 00:26.500
 He is part owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers.

00:26.500 --> 00:29.020
 He's the guitarist for the band Ghost Hounds

00:29.020 --> 00:31.620
 that tours with the Rolling Stones.

00:31.620 --> 00:35.340
 But most importantly, he's humble, down to earth,

00:35.340 --> 00:38.360
 and someone who has quickly become a mentor and friend.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.460

00:44.900 --> 00:48.760
 And now, here's my conversation with Thomas Tall.

00:49.780 --> 00:53.260
 In 2004, you founded Legendary Entertainment,

00:53.260 --> 00:55.020
 known for producing blockbusters

00:55.020 --> 00:57.860
 like Batman's Dark Knight Trilogy,

00:57.860 --> 00:59.900
 that includes Batman Begins, Dark Knight,

00:59.900 --> 01:03.260
 and Dark Knight Rises, The Hangover franchise,

01:03.260 --> 01:05.900
 Godzilla, Inception, Jurassic World, 300,

01:05.900 --> 01:07.220
 and the list goes on.

01:07.220 --> 01:10.380
 It's just some of the biggest movies in history.

01:10.380 --> 01:12.580
 What does it take to make an epic movie like that?

01:12.580 --> 01:14.140
 Or what does it take to make it happen

01:14.140 --> 01:15.220
 from start to finish?

01:16.660 --> 01:19.620
 Well, look, I've been enamored with movies

01:19.620 --> 01:21.300
 since I was a kid as a fan,

01:21.300 --> 01:25.260
 and I think what you need is to be able

01:25.260 --> 01:26.620
 to tell a great story.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.700
 And if you're gonna tell a great story,

01:28.700 --> 01:30.380
 you need a great director.

01:30.380 --> 01:32.620
 You gotta start with a fantastic script

01:33.880 --> 01:38.380
 that is able to take some of these iconic characters

01:38.380 --> 01:41.060
 that we did and put your own stamp on it

01:41.060 --> 01:44.860
 while still respecting the mythology.

01:44.860 --> 01:48.700
 And I had zero experience in movies and television

01:48.700 --> 01:50.220
 before I started Legendary,

01:50.220 --> 01:53.220
 so it was a very interesting trip.

01:53.220 --> 01:57.300
 Total luck that we had the opportunity

01:57.300 --> 02:01.020
 to make five movies at the time with Chris Nolan,

02:01.020 --> 02:03.140
 who turned out to be one of the greatest filmmakers

02:03.140 --> 02:04.480
 of all time.

02:04.480 --> 02:07.880
 But each one is its own little startup company,

02:08.900 --> 02:11.980
 and I don't think there's any formula to get there,

02:11.980 --> 02:15.140
 but I know that if you don't have a great director

02:15.140 --> 02:17.620
 and a great script, if you don't have that foundation,

02:17.620 --> 02:18.940
 it's hard to pull off.

02:18.940 --> 02:21.180
 Who's the CEO of that little startup company?

02:21.180 --> 02:22.780
 Is it the director?

02:22.780 --> 02:25.100
 Who would you say defines the success

02:25.100 --> 02:26.440
 or the failure of a movie?

02:26.440 --> 02:30.000
 Well, when you build a big movie like that,

02:30.000 --> 02:33.380
 it's an enormous effort, 360 degrees.

02:33.380 --> 02:37.820
 I mean, from digital effects, certainly the actors.

02:37.820 --> 02:40.860
 I mean, if you have an amazing script and amazing director,

02:40.860 --> 02:42.980
 but you don't believe anybody playing the parts,

02:42.980 --> 02:43.820
 that's a problem.

02:43.820 --> 02:47.940
 So the reason I think it was so difficult to pull off

02:47.940 --> 02:51.200
 is I always used to say you start with a stack of papers

02:51.200 --> 02:55.820
 with words on it called the script, bring that to life,

02:55.820 --> 02:58.500
 and you're asking an audience to believe in everything

02:58.500 --> 03:00.340
 that you're trying to put out there,

03:00.340 --> 03:02.900
 and you've got a cast that,

03:02.900 --> 03:05.100
 even if they're immensely talented individually,

03:05.100 --> 03:06.380
 they have to mesh together,

03:06.380 --> 03:08.280
 they have to have chemistry together.

03:09.820 --> 03:13.780
 And the director is kind of a general on the battlefield,

03:13.780 --> 03:18.380
 but if you have a strong producer who's very hands on,

03:18.380 --> 03:22.340
 but it truly, to me, is each one had its own story

03:22.340 --> 03:24.740
 and its own sort of how it came to be

03:24.740 --> 03:27.360
 and why it worked or didn't work.

03:28.260 --> 03:30.780
 See, you said you were new to the industry,

03:30.780 --> 03:34.540
 but you did a lot of revolutionary things with Legendary.

03:34.540 --> 03:38.660
 So at that time and now, what is the good, the bad,

03:38.660 --> 03:41.340
 and the ugly of the business of filmmaking?

03:41.340 --> 03:44.460
 What are some interesting holes that you were able to,

03:44.460 --> 03:47.340
 or like problems that you were able to fix?

03:47.340 --> 03:50.860
 What problems still exist that can still be solved?

03:51.900 --> 03:55.900
 Well, look, the business has changed so radically

03:55.900 --> 03:58.220
 since 2004.

03:58.220 --> 04:01.740
 When I started Legendary, DVDs were still a cash cow.

04:01.740 --> 04:05.580
 So that's how far things have come.

04:05.580 --> 04:07.140
 But I would say a couple of things.

04:07.140 --> 04:10.740
 The reason that I started it from a business perspective

04:10.740 --> 04:14.220
 was at the time it was a $30 billion industry,

04:14.220 --> 04:17.660
 and there was no institutional capital

04:17.660 --> 04:19.640
 around the movie business.

04:19.640 --> 04:20.860
 And I was fascinated by that

04:20.860 --> 04:23.700
 because almost every other category that you look at

04:23.700 --> 04:26.420
 of that size has institutional capital,

04:26.420 --> 04:27.980
 private equity, et cetera,

04:27.980 --> 04:31.020
 is kind of a cottage industry set up around it.

04:31.020 --> 04:35.020
 And I was perplexed and fascinated that that didn't occur.

04:35.020 --> 04:36.780
 And the way the movie business worked

04:36.780 --> 04:40.020
 was unlike any business I'd ever looked at before.

04:40.020 --> 04:43.840
 So after kind of convincing myself

04:43.840 --> 04:45.980
 that you could actually make money

04:45.980 --> 04:48.500
 if you were disciplined and had the right approach,

04:49.500 --> 04:50.340
 you know, went out,

04:50.340 --> 04:52.300
 raised the money from the capital markets,

04:52.300 --> 04:54.740
 markets which was Herculean,

04:54.740 --> 04:58.880
 still maybe the hardest thing I've ever done in my career,

04:58.880 --> 05:01.980
 to walk around and say, look, I have no experience.

05:01.980 --> 05:04.980
 I've never done this before, but, you know.

05:04.980 --> 05:08.940
 And the second thing, being very fortunate at the time,

05:08.940 --> 05:11.740
 was able to partner up with Warner Brothers.

05:11.740 --> 05:15.860
 Warner's at the time was run by a man named Alan Horn,

05:15.860 --> 05:18.920
 who besides being creative is also a Harvard MBA.

05:18.920 --> 05:21.660
 So really understood what I wanted to do.

05:22.780 --> 05:26.300
 And Alan, you know, was just an absolute gentleman,

05:26.300 --> 05:29.380
 someone that I still look up to to this day.

05:29.380 --> 05:31.860
 After Warner Brothers, he went and ran Disney

05:31.860 --> 05:33.560
 with their run, you know,

05:33.560 --> 05:35.640
 between Marvel and Star Wars and everything.

05:35.640 --> 05:40.640
 And so between Alan being responsible for Harry Potter,

05:40.640 --> 05:43.020
 the Dark Knight stuff, and then onto all the Disney stuff,

05:43.020 --> 05:44.500
 he probably had as great a career

05:44.500 --> 05:47.940
 as anyone I've ever heard of in the movie business.

05:47.940 --> 05:52.140
 So my first focus was around sort of two concepts,

05:52.140 --> 05:57.140
 global, worldwide, large tentpole films and franchises,

05:57.420 --> 05:59.660
 and then the business aspect of being,

05:59.660 --> 06:03.300
 bringing longterm institutional capital to bear.

06:03.300 --> 06:05.460
 I'm gonna ask you dumb questions,

06:05.460 --> 06:10.380
 which is part of the style, I guess.

06:10.380 --> 06:13.820
 But just for people who don't know, including me,

06:13.820 --> 06:16.500
 what is institutional, what is capital?

06:16.500 --> 06:18.340
 What is institutional capital?

06:18.340 --> 06:20.700
 What is equity, what is private equity?

06:20.700 --> 06:21.800
 Got it, okay.

06:21.800 --> 06:26.080
 Well, so if you're starting a company

06:27.040 --> 06:30.900
 and you go around to a bunch of your successful friends

06:30.900 --> 06:34.020
 and say, hey, you should invest in my company.

06:34.020 --> 06:37.380
 Well, that's sort of, that's great and it's capital,

06:37.380 --> 06:42.380
 but it's not getting money from Fidelity or TRO

06:42.700 --> 06:46.580
 or a sovereign wealth fund or an endowment fund

06:46.580 --> 06:51.580
 from a university that has large pools of organized capital

06:52.100 --> 06:56.500
 that has a longterm point of view on your business.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.260
 So if you get money from your neighbor

06:59.260 --> 07:01.520
 who's a successful dentist,

07:01.520 --> 07:03.580
 next year the dentist may say,

07:03.580 --> 07:07.380
 hey, times are hard, I need my money back.

07:07.380 --> 07:10.660
 If you're partners with Fidelity or Morgan Stanley

07:10.660 --> 07:12.460
 or any of these institutions,

07:12.460 --> 07:16.180
 they have the capital and the wherewithal to say,

07:16.180 --> 07:19.540
 okay, I'm looking at this over the next five to 10 years.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.540
 And I thought there was an opportunity

07:21.540 --> 07:26.540
 to bring that type of capital to the movie business

07:26.660 --> 07:27.980
 to be patient.

07:27.980 --> 07:32.780
 And the benefit of that patient, so it's longterm,

07:32.780 --> 07:34.980
 you have to deal with fewer parties

07:34.980 --> 07:37.780
 and they would do much larger investments.

07:38.740 --> 07:40.100
 So what are the benefits?

07:40.100 --> 07:41.540
 What are the sort of the challenges

07:41.540 --> 07:42.740
 of that kind of investment?

07:42.740 --> 07:45.220
 Well, I think the benefits in some ways

07:45.220 --> 07:48.980
 are they're professionals who are largely dispassionate.

07:48.980 --> 07:51.380
 It's like, look, if you're hitting the numbers you told me

07:51.380 --> 07:54.080
 and you're hitting your plan, great.

07:55.300 --> 07:58.900
 And the other thing that always was interesting to me

07:58.900 --> 08:02.480
 about the movie business is if I'm investing

08:02.480 --> 08:04.300
 in an artificial intelligence company

08:04.300 --> 08:06.460
 or a chipset company or something like that,

08:07.780 --> 08:11.900
 a lot of the institutions don't have the technical expertise

08:11.900 --> 08:16.380
 to really truly grasp what's being done.

08:16.380 --> 08:19.280
 So they don't, other than good business practices,

08:19.280 --> 08:21.700
 they're not offering every little opinion.

08:21.700 --> 08:25.160
 The movies and television are completely approachable,

08:25.160 --> 08:27.860
 meaning everybody has an opinion.

08:27.860 --> 08:31.400
 So whether it's, I think you guys chose the wrong actor

08:31.400 --> 08:33.500
 for that or why did you do that movie?

08:34.500 --> 08:38.460
 So it invites a lot more sort of second guessing

08:38.460 --> 08:39.480
 and things like that.

08:39.480 --> 08:42.780
 So that was always one of the idiosyncrasies

08:42.780 --> 08:46.400
 of the business that I thought was interesting.

08:47.280 --> 08:50.220
 And then when you talk about private equity

08:50.220 --> 08:52.820
 versus public equity, if you're a public company

08:52.820 --> 08:56.140
 where the companies are traded,

08:56.140 --> 08:59.500
 you wanna buy Microsoft shares, you just go to your broker,

08:59.500 --> 09:01.780
 go on TD Ameritrade and buy them.

09:01.780 --> 09:04.780
 If on the other hand, you're talking about private equity,

09:04.780 --> 09:08.460
 that's institutions or individuals

09:08.460 --> 09:11.140
 investing in private companies.

09:11.140 --> 09:13.700
 So thus, if you have pools of capital

09:13.700 --> 09:16.740
 that mostly invest in private equity deals,

09:16.740 --> 09:18.540
 that's how you'd think about it.

09:18.540 --> 09:20.180
 It's difficult to make those happen

09:20.180 --> 09:23.540
 because it's individuals, you have to sort of,

09:23.540 --> 09:26.460
 what, have dinners and agree.

09:26.460 --> 09:31.140
 So it's much less, it's much more human,

09:31.140 --> 09:33.580
 much less mechanical, I would say.

09:33.580 --> 09:36.020
 Yeah, now, and again, massive difference

09:36.020 --> 09:41.020
 between large private equity shops who are professionalized

09:41.060 --> 09:44.400
 and in the same category that I mentioned earlier

09:44.400 --> 09:49.300
 versus private individuals who are wealthy or whatever.

09:49.300 --> 09:51.980
 But again, it's much more individualized

09:51.980 --> 09:55.740
 when you're going to people who like your idea

09:55.740 --> 09:58.460
 and just say, I'd like to invest in this.

09:58.460 --> 10:01.900
 Is that, from all the kinds of investments you've seen,

10:03.500 --> 10:05.200
 what do you think is the most conducive

10:05.200 --> 10:08.660
 to creating works of genius,

10:08.660 --> 10:11.100
 whether that's in technology, AI space,

10:11.100 --> 10:12.820
 or whether that's in movies?

10:12.820 --> 10:15.020
 So creating something special in this world.

10:16.100 --> 10:18.800
 I would say a couple of things.

10:18.800 --> 10:23.800
 Enough money that whatever endeavor you're going into,

10:23.800 --> 10:27.720
 that you're not so nervous about the edges, right?

10:27.720 --> 10:32.240
 If I have $100 to spend and I think I can create

10:32.240 --> 10:36.360
 a perpetual motion machine or something for $104,

10:37.240 --> 10:39.880
 I can't do it because they're all over me about the budget.

10:39.880 --> 10:43.480
 So I would say making sure that you have enough capital,

10:43.480 --> 10:46.640
 making sure that that capital is patient enough

10:46.640 --> 10:48.640
 so that it's, if you're gonna do things

10:48.640 --> 10:52.280
 that are extraordinary, it takes some time.

10:52.280 --> 10:55.080
 And you're gonna break stuff, right?

10:55.080 --> 10:56.160
 You're gonna make mistakes,

10:56.160 --> 10:58.800
 you're gonna have a whole bunch of film

10:58.800 --> 11:00.480
 on the cutting room floor, so to speak,

11:00.480 --> 11:01.520
 or if you're in the lab,

11:01.520 --> 11:04.140
 you're gonna have a whole bunch of broken stuff.

11:04.140 --> 11:07.640
 And I also think it's very important at the beginning,

11:07.640 --> 11:10.400
 and I always try to do this with companies I invest in

11:10.400 --> 11:15.400
 or buy, is make sure that you have a philosophical

11:15.520 --> 11:20.080
 and somewhat mechanical alignment with the management team.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.800
 So that going in, you both understand,

11:23.800 --> 11:26.280
 hey, this is how we think about this problem

11:26.280 --> 11:30.520
 or this company, this is what we feel like our culture is,

11:30.520 --> 11:32.760
 this is what our goal is, and these are the metrics

11:32.760 --> 11:35.640
 by which we'll agree to measure them by.

11:35.640 --> 11:39.680
 Because if you don't have that shared,

11:39.680 --> 11:42.680
 you know, hey, we're gonna take this journey,

11:42.680 --> 11:45.280
 then I think that's where people get upset,

11:45.280 --> 11:47.060
 disappointed, et cetera.

11:47.060 --> 11:50.920
 What about, this is a weird question, but constraints.

11:50.920 --> 11:53.280
 So this is both for filmmaking and investment.

11:54.640 --> 11:57.020
 Do you think more money is always better?

11:57.020 --> 11:58.500
 No.

11:58.500 --> 12:01.840
 So I like constraints a lot.

12:01.840 --> 12:06.360
 It's like constraints and almost like a desperation,

12:06.360 --> 12:10.480
 and deadlines are catalysts for creativity,

12:10.480 --> 12:15.220
 for productivity, for sort of innovation.

12:15.220 --> 12:19.080
 So can you kind of speak to that as an investor,

12:19.080 --> 12:23.400
 as a creator, like what's the right balance here?

12:23.400 --> 12:27.600
 Well, I think if you're focused on a particular problem

12:27.600 --> 12:31.960
 or a company or a thesis, if you have that focus

12:31.960 --> 12:36.120
 and you feel like I have unlimited resources

12:36.120 --> 12:39.220
 or renewable resources, so there's really,

12:39.220 --> 12:43.520
 there's no leverage in the situation, right?

12:43.520 --> 12:47.240
 There's no, if I fail at this,

12:47.240 --> 12:49.440
 I'll just go get more money, right?

12:49.440 --> 12:54.040
 I'll just go, I think that's a hard way to be resilient

12:55.000 --> 12:58.520
 and to think of new ways to solve problems.

13:00.720 --> 13:05.200
 So I think capitalizing things just, you know,

13:05.200 --> 13:08.640
 to the nth degree does create some problems.

13:08.640 --> 13:11.320
 So I think there's that perfect blend of

13:11.320 --> 13:14.000
 don't starve the oxygen to the point

13:14.000 --> 13:15.960
 where you make short term decisions

13:15.960 --> 13:18.720
 or non strategic or thoughtful decisions

13:18.720 --> 13:20.360
 because you gotta pay the rent.

13:20.360 --> 13:24.880
 And on the other hand, you can't have it be like this,

13:24.880 --> 13:28.940
 you know, everlasting gobstopper of whatever you want

13:28.940 --> 13:30.400
 will just keep flowing the cash

13:30.400 --> 13:33.080
 because that doesn't create any friction points

13:33.080 --> 13:38.080
 that I think do result in works of genius,

13:38.080 --> 13:42.580
 works of genius in things that, you know,

13:42.580 --> 13:44.260
 that are transformative.

13:44.260 --> 13:48.460
 And one of the things that is interesting to me

13:48.460 --> 13:52.540
 about society sort of writ large is

13:54.100 --> 13:57.100
 I think that when you go through hard times

13:59.020 --> 14:02.260
 and you have to do things that are uncomfortable

14:02.260 --> 14:04.980
 and you don't wanna do them because you're tired,

14:04.980 --> 14:09.020
 because you're, that in some ways builds up that

14:09.020 --> 14:12.720
 you're comfortable being uncomfortable muscle.

14:12.720 --> 14:17.720
 And I sometimes think we're losing that a little bit

14:17.920 --> 14:20.880
 and you can't sort of paint with a wide brush,

14:20.880 --> 14:25.480
 but you know, that's one of the things

14:25.480 --> 14:30.300
 that I kind of observe and hope that we don't go that way.

14:30.300 --> 14:34.220
 I do think challenge and discomfort are a kind of gift

14:34.220 --> 14:36.940
 because like overcoming that,

14:36.940 --> 14:39.040
 it's like from every perspective,

14:39.040 --> 14:41.320
 from a human perspective, it's a source of happiness

14:41.320 --> 14:43.780
 and fulfillment, overcoming challenge.

14:43.780 --> 14:45.840
 But from a business perspective,

14:45.840 --> 14:48.860
 I see like if something is really difficult,

14:48.860 --> 14:51.740
 to me it's also a sign that most others would,

14:51.740 --> 14:54.400
 or many others would fail at this point.

14:54.400 --> 14:55.920
 So like it's a feature.

14:55.920 --> 14:58.120
 It's nice that something is difficult.

14:58.120 --> 15:02.100
 When people tell you that something is impossible,

15:02.100 --> 15:03.980
 I love that because it's like, all right,

15:03.980 --> 15:06.980
 well then that's what a lot of people would believe.

15:06.980 --> 15:09.540
 And that gives you an opportunity to be the person

15:09.540 --> 15:11.120
 who shows it's not impossible.

15:11.120 --> 15:12.800
 And you, of course you might be wrong,

15:12.800 --> 15:14.120
 but if you're not wrong,

15:14.120 --> 15:15.600
 you have the opportunity to stand out.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.840
 So going through that hardship, taking those big risks,

15:18.840 --> 15:20.400
 it's going to really pay off.

15:20.400 --> 15:25.400
 So like discomfort is a feature, not a bug

15:26.760 --> 15:30.120
 of both personal life, it's just good for life,

15:30.120 --> 15:34.760
 but for business, it seems like just good business sense.

15:34.760 --> 15:38.620
 If something is hard, it's probably a good idea to do that.

15:38.620 --> 15:39.460
 Yeah.

15:39.460 --> 15:41.560
 Because most others will fail.

15:41.560 --> 15:42.400
 Fun question.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.520
 I don't know if you can answer this,

15:43.520 --> 15:46.160
 but what's the most expensive movie

15:46.160 --> 15:48.040
 you were involved with to make?

15:48.040 --> 15:50.860
 And why was it, you don't have to say numbers,

15:50.860 --> 15:53.160
 but like is something stand out

15:53.160 --> 15:57.380
 as being exceptionally expensive and why is it expensive?

15:57.380 --> 16:01.500
 Um, I think Jurassic World was pretty expensive.

16:01.500 --> 16:02.340
 Nice.

16:02.340 --> 16:04.220
 I mean, worked out great.

16:05.740 --> 16:06.940
 And, uh.

16:06.940 --> 16:09.580
 That's an epic film, by the way.

16:09.580 --> 16:13.900
 It, look, it's one of my favorites.

16:13.900 --> 16:16.180
 They just did an amazing job.

16:16.180 --> 16:20.400
 And frankly, the crazy thing about my life

16:20.400 --> 16:23.060
 is all the stuff that I loved as a kid

16:23.060 --> 16:27.240
 somehow came full circle back into my adult life.

16:27.240 --> 16:31.300
 And having the opportunity while I was out there

16:31.300 --> 16:35.220
 to develop a friendship with Steven Spielberg

16:35.220 --> 16:39.120
 and then have my name on the same film as Steven Spielberg.

16:39.120 --> 16:42.760
 I mean, that was pretty surreal.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.900
 So that was an expensive film.

16:46.900 --> 16:49.820
 You know, Dark Knight Rises was an expensive film.

16:49.820 --> 16:51.660
 But again, to me, there's a difference

16:51.660 --> 16:54.480
 between expensive and irresponsible,

16:54.480 --> 16:58.540
 and expensive because the vision warranted

16:58.540 --> 17:01.180
 and it turned out financially it certainly did.

17:01.180 --> 17:02.780
 Yeah, with Jurassic World, it's.

17:04.340 --> 17:06.420
 I mean, I can't even imagine having those meetings

17:06.420 --> 17:08.980
 because like you have to create so much

17:08.980 --> 17:11.100
 and so much of it is obviously not real.

17:11.100 --> 17:14.200
 You can't bring dinosaurs in a.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.780
 Yeah.

17:15.780 --> 17:17.460
 Is that where a lot of the cost is,

17:17.460 --> 17:22.460
 is in the computer side of things?

17:22.460 --> 17:26.040
 Yeah, those are generally pretty massive components

17:26.040 --> 17:30.080
 of the budget, and especially if you're doing it

17:30.080 --> 17:32.640
 and inventing things as you go.

17:32.640 --> 17:36.440
 I mean, Jim Cameron is one of those filmmakers

17:36.440 --> 17:41.440
 who is designing the plane as it's flying

17:41.480 --> 17:43.840
 in such a brilliant way.

17:43.840 --> 17:47.440
 And I've got to know him over the years

17:47.440 --> 17:51.280
 and just in awe of the way his brain works.

17:51.280 --> 17:55.280
 And so yeah, it's a big component.

17:55.280 --> 17:57.000
 Can you speak a little bit more to him

17:57.000 --> 18:01.040
 in terms of, because you're such a fascinating person

18:01.040 --> 18:02.920
 because you care a lot about technology.

18:02.920 --> 18:06.000
 You care a lot about the cutting edge of technology.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.280
 So how does he, a creator, a director,

18:10.280 --> 18:12.440
 build the plane while it's flying?

18:12.440 --> 18:15.600
 Like what's the role of innovation in this whole process?

18:15.600 --> 18:20.040
 Well, so I never made a film with Jim.

18:20.040 --> 18:22.640
 I'm just a huge fan and got to know him

18:23.800 --> 18:26.340
 and John Landau, his producing partner.

18:27.360 --> 18:31.360
 And one of the things that just fascinates me about Jim is,

18:31.360 --> 18:34.960
 so he makes Titanic and there's a bunch of underwater cameras

18:34.960 --> 18:37.520
 and things that they need that don't exist.

18:37.520 --> 18:42.520
 So he goes and invents them and has a good grasp

18:42.560 --> 18:46.060
 of engineering and has not only the imagination,

18:46.060 --> 18:50.420
 but the ability to lead a team to build them.

18:50.420 --> 18:53.940
 I got to go down early when they were shooting Avatar

18:55.020 --> 18:57.920
 at a warehouse, I think it was, where they were shooting.

18:57.920 --> 19:02.000
 And as they were explaining to me how they were capturing it

19:02.000 --> 19:03.700
 and that they could go back later

19:03.700 --> 19:08.540
 because they created the environment, it blew my mind.

19:08.540 --> 19:11.160
 And I said, okay, this is truly,

19:11.160 --> 19:13.000
 people talk about a big leap.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.040
 This certainly is one.

19:14.040 --> 19:18.720
 So he has continued to push the envelope

19:18.720 --> 19:20.940
 in terms of the art of the possible.

19:20.940 --> 19:24.760
 And I just think he's an incredible genius in that way.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.760
 Again, another hard question.

19:27.760 --> 19:32.060
 So you, in the realm of music, care about story, storytelling.

19:33.520 --> 19:37.320
 Is there some aspect in which money

19:37.320 --> 19:40.060
 and beautiful graphics get in the way of story?

19:40.060 --> 19:45.060
 In filmmaking, so if you think about Jurassic World,

19:47.140 --> 19:49.900
 obviously that's an experience like any other.

19:52.380 --> 19:54.780
 Like what do you think about the tension

19:54.780 --> 19:59.780
 between story, experience and like visual effects?

20:01.460 --> 20:06.460
 Well, look, if you're using big effect shots

20:06.460 --> 20:10.560
 and all kinds of tricks to cover over the fact

20:10.560 --> 20:13.640
 that you don't have a very interesting story to tell,

20:13.640 --> 20:15.760
 that's where I think it gets in the way.

20:17.720 --> 20:21.800
 Where I think you have these incredible filmmakers,

20:21.800 --> 20:23.520
 we mentioned Chris Nolan and Jim Cameron,

20:23.520 --> 20:28.520
 Guillermo del Toro, you could go on and on,

20:28.520 --> 20:33.520
 folks that just see the world differently

20:33.520 --> 20:38.520
 and use technology to enhance the storytelling, right?

20:38.820 --> 20:41.780
 To make you believe differently,

20:42.660 --> 20:46.820
 rather to make you not just suspend your disbelief,

20:46.820 --> 20:49.420
 but to feel like you're immersed in it.

20:49.420 --> 20:52.260
 So I've certainly seen it done expertly

20:52.260 --> 20:53.820
 and I've seen it done poorly.

20:54.620 --> 20:57.460
 You've talked about this a little bit in the past.

20:57.460 --> 21:02.140
 You kind of left the moviemaking business

21:02.140 --> 21:05.660
 at an interesting time, perhaps you saw the changes.

21:07.060 --> 21:10.120
 There's been a lot of excitement with Netflix, with TV,

21:10.120 --> 21:13.860
 so the role of film in society has changed.

21:13.860 --> 21:18.180
 So what do you think is the future of movies versus TV?

21:18.180 --> 21:21.460
 Like if you were as a business person, as a creator,

21:21.460 --> 21:24.820
 as a consumer, as a technologist,

21:24.820 --> 21:27.500
 are thinking about the next 10, 20 years,

21:27.500 --> 21:31.960
 what do you think is going to be the godfather,

21:31.960 --> 21:36.060
 the great pieces that move us as a society

21:36.060 --> 21:37.320
 in the next 10, 20 years?

21:37.320 --> 21:38.220
 Is it going to be TV?

21:38.220 --> 21:39.660
 Is it going to be movie?

21:39.660 --> 21:43.660
 Is it going to be a TikTok clips?

21:43.660 --> 21:44.600
 What is it?

21:44.600 --> 21:48.540
 Well, so, and I think the other category

21:48.540 --> 21:52.260
 that I would add to that, that will be the next great medium

21:52.260 --> 21:55.020
 is truly immersive virtual reality

21:55.980 --> 22:00.500
 in which new storytellers will emerge,

22:00.500 --> 22:02.940
 especially when you can go into VR

22:03.820 --> 22:08.260
 and there's enough computing power to sustain it

22:08.260 --> 22:10.340
 and to allow it to be social

22:10.340 --> 22:14.680
 and for you to have different paths to go down.

22:14.680 --> 22:17.020
 That'll be, I think, the next realm

22:17.020 --> 22:20.100
 of what storytelling and experience will look like.

22:20.100 --> 22:22.140
 Do you think a video game kind of world

22:22.140 --> 22:26.180
 or is it more movies or is it more social network

22:26.180 --> 22:30.780
 or is it all of it kind of blending reality and gaming

22:30.780 --> 22:31.780
 and movies?

22:31.780 --> 22:35.100
 Yeah, I thought if you saw Ready Player One,

22:35.100 --> 22:37.820
 which I love the book and the movie was cool too,

22:39.100 --> 22:42.980
 but that's one version of it, right?

22:42.980 --> 22:46.220
 Where you go in, now everybody's talking about the metaverse

22:46.220 --> 22:47.860
 and all that, but you go into a world

22:47.860 --> 22:50.380
 that's fully rendered as yourself

22:50.380 --> 22:51.540
 and you interact with that world.

22:51.540 --> 22:54.840
 The other side of it is to go in somewhere

22:54.840 --> 22:57.760
 between being a passive observer,

22:57.760 --> 23:00.080
 but being able to move around your point of view

23:00.080 --> 23:03.300
 and experiences, which I think is interesting.

23:03.300 --> 23:07.120
 And then I think another adventure, so to speak,

23:07.120 --> 23:10.340
 I could think of is a blend of video games.

23:10.340 --> 23:12.020
 So there's a mission, right?

23:12.020 --> 23:14.580
 There's obstacles, there's everything

23:14.580 --> 23:17.900
 and you move through it, but it's immersive

23:17.900 --> 23:19.640
 and it tells a story at the same time.

23:19.640 --> 23:22.740
 And that's why I think you're gonna see

23:22.740 --> 23:27.740
 new amazing storytellers that we don't know yet

23:27.860 --> 23:29.740
 that understand how to innovate

23:29.740 --> 23:32.860
 and how to make you feel something in that environment.

23:34.540 --> 23:39.540
 And to your earlier point, I saw probably around 2015

23:41.820 --> 23:46.820
 when Netflix decided to be bold, put out House of Cards,

23:47.620 --> 23:50.660
 put out all the episodes, leave you in charge

23:50.660 --> 23:52.740
 of the pace at which you would view them,

23:53.740 --> 23:55.600
 which I thought was great.

23:56.420 --> 23:57.780
 That was a gutsy move.

23:57.780 --> 23:58.700
 Yes, it was.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.600
 And I can't tell you around Hollywood,

24:00.600 --> 24:03.060
 anybody that says that everybody thought it was a great idea

24:03.060 --> 24:06.740
 is not being truthful because everybody I talked to

24:06.740 --> 24:10.140
 said this is, they're idiots, right?

24:10.140 --> 24:13.480
 What do they know about movie making and TV?

24:13.480 --> 24:18.480
 And what I saw happening was if you look

24:18.480 --> 24:21.300
 at what Netflix pulled off and they realized

24:21.300 --> 24:24.740
 that there isn't really a moat around the studios,

24:24.740 --> 24:29.580
 you really could make stuff and really good stuff.

24:29.580 --> 24:31.940
 And so they started to create their own content

24:32.820 --> 24:37.700
 that pulled in Amazon, which pulled in Google

24:37.700 --> 24:40.580
 through YouTube and then you had Hulu,

24:40.580 --> 24:43.260
 then you had Disney deciding

24:43.260 --> 24:44.660
 that they're gonna have Disney Plus.

24:44.660 --> 24:47.300
 And the next thing you know, you have some

24:47.300 --> 24:50.300
 of the biggest companies with the largest balance sheets

24:50.300 --> 24:54.060
 on the planet being in the creative business.

24:55.620 --> 24:58.020
 If you're an independent, that's bringing a knife

24:58.020 --> 25:00.580
 to a gunfight to be sure.

25:00.580 --> 25:03.760
 And so I thought that was interesting.

25:03.760 --> 25:06.880
 The other thing that it used to be that movies

25:06.880 --> 25:08.360
 were where the big things happened

25:08.360 --> 25:10.320
 and television was sort of,

25:10.320 --> 25:13.140
 it was small screen, different experience.

25:13.140 --> 25:15.780
 And you had something like Game of Thrones come out,

25:15.780 --> 25:19.860
 which was not only on the same epic level visually

25:19.860 --> 25:22.560
 and storytelling wise, but had the budget

25:22.560 --> 25:24.040
 to be able to do it.

25:24.040 --> 25:29.040
 And now I think you're seeing all kinds

25:31.780 --> 25:35.780
 of different storytelling taking place.

25:35.780 --> 25:40.460
 And I also like that you're not pigeonholed into a time.

25:40.460 --> 25:42.620
 You got two hours to tell the story.

25:42.620 --> 25:44.260
 You can do a three part mini series,

25:44.260 --> 25:45.480
 a five part mini series.

25:45.480 --> 25:49.340
 You can do television that's all kinds of different format.

25:49.340 --> 25:53.500
 That I think allows creators

25:53.500 --> 25:55.300
 to do a lot more interesting things.

25:57.220 --> 25:59.780
 It is also interesting to consider the role

25:59.780 --> 26:01.600
 of companies that enable that,

26:01.600 --> 26:04.660
 like the capital that enables that.

26:04.660 --> 26:08.140
 Without Netflix and HBO, you wouldn't have

26:09.460 --> 26:11.340
 some of these epic shows.

26:11.340 --> 26:14.340
 And so if we're thinking about the virtual reality world

26:14.340 --> 26:15.700
 that you're talking about,

26:16.700 --> 26:19.340
 it's interesting to consider who will enable that.

26:19.340 --> 26:22.580
 Now, like you said, Facebook is talking about meta

26:22.580 --> 26:25.580
 and metaverse, but it's unclear

26:25.580 --> 26:28.720
 that just having money is enough.

26:28.720 --> 26:31.580
 Netflix did a lot of really revolutionary stuff.

26:33.020 --> 26:34.180
 Amazon has money.

26:34.180 --> 26:35.380
 There's a lot of companies that have money

26:35.380 --> 26:38.500
 that don't quite do as good of a job yet

26:38.500 --> 26:43.500
 at enabling creators of creating revolutionary new content.

26:44.540 --> 26:46.620
 That changes the whole industry.

26:46.620 --> 26:48.100
 And that's probably going to be the case

26:48.100 --> 26:49.420
 with virtual reality.

26:49.420 --> 26:54.140
 There is a lot of money needed to enable experiences,

26:54.140 --> 26:57.020
 like in terms of compute infrastructure.

26:57.020 --> 26:59.540
 There needs to be a huge amount of money there,

26:59.540 --> 27:02.860
 but you also need to somehow give freedom to creators

27:02.860 --> 27:05.900
 to have fun, to do their best work,

27:05.900 --> 27:10.900
 and at the same time provide the perfect amount

27:11.620 --> 27:13.620
 of constraints, all of that together.

27:13.620 --> 27:15.180
 However Netflix makes it happen,

27:15.180 --> 27:16.460
 they do a pretty good job

27:16.460 --> 27:18.880
 because it's a very constrained platform,

27:18.880 --> 27:21.340
 but yet all the creators I've ever talked to,

27:21.340 --> 27:24.300
 comedians and so on, that work with Netflix,

27:24.300 --> 27:26.720
 are really happy because they feel free

27:26.720 --> 27:27.900
 to create their work.

27:27.900 --> 27:32.580
 Yeah, and I think a lot of times companies are a letterhead,

27:32.580 --> 27:34.500
 but it boils down to the people.

27:34.500 --> 27:38.700
 And I think I've known Ted Sarandos a long time

27:38.700 --> 27:40.840
 who ran the studio at Netflix

27:40.840 --> 27:44.420
 and now took over for Reed running the company.

27:44.420 --> 27:47.620
 But Ted, very smart, talented guy,

27:47.620 --> 27:50.880
 and understood early how to cultivate talent

27:50.880 --> 27:53.540
 and relationships with talent, which is important.

27:53.540 --> 27:56.220
 When you're dealing with creative people,

27:56.220 --> 27:58.300
 their motivations and their goals

27:58.300 --> 28:00.020
 are not always the same, right?

28:00.020 --> 28:02.420
 They're not always capitalistic, right?

28:02.420 --> 28:05.900
 And so in terms of being able to communicate

28:05.900 --> 28:10.640
 with creative people that are not always A to B to C

28:10.640 --> 28:11.940
 is a talent.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.180
 And so I think they did a great job.

28:14.180 --> 28:16.300
 Ted did a great job with that early.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.460
 But I think that you're gonna see different formats.

28:21.460 --> 28:26.200
 I don't think, I mean, going to a theater

28:26.200 --> 28:30.580
 to see a massive movie on that screen in that format

28:30.580 --> 28:33.260
 is a fundamentally different experience.

28:33.260 --> 28:36.180
 And I think you're gonna find movies,

28:36.180 --> 28:38.800
 my old shop, Legendary, just put out Dune,

28:38.800 --> 28:41.380
 which I thought was phenomenal.

28:43.980 --> 28:46.660
 When we secured the rights to Dune years ago,

28:48.700 --> 28:51.420
 I was over the moon because I love the book.

28:51.420 --> 28:56.420
 I love the entire world that is Dune.

28:57.180 --> 28:59.920
 And that's a movie that I think you see on the big screen.

28:59.920 --> 29:03.300
 I think when Avatar 2 comes out,

29:03.300 --> 29:06.020
 I wanna see that on a big screen.

29:06.020 --> 29:09.600
 But I think you're gonna see a ton of content

29:09.600 --> 29:11.420
 is obviously being produced,

29:11.420 --> 29:14.140
 and it's not all gonna go to a theater going experience.

29:14.140 --> 29:17.180
 So you're gonna see, I think, different versions of this

29:17.180 --> 29:18.760
 over the next five to 10 years.

29:19.740 --> 29:22.100
 In case James Cameron is listening to this,

29:22.100 --> 29:25.260
 so he officially agreed to talk at the time of,

29:25.260 --> 29:27.820
 on this podcast, at the time of Avatar 2 release.

29:27.820 --> 29:30.660
 I'm just holding you to that in this recorded conversation.

29:31.860 --> 29:36.520
 Also just super excited, both the movie and the director.

29:38.240 --> 29:41.500
 There's something special about movies.

29:41.500 --> 29:46.500
 They win Oscars, they're historic in nature.

29:46.760 --> 29:48.500
 There's something about TV shows,

29:48.500 --> 29:50.980
 even when they're epic like Game of Thrones,

29:50.980 --> 29:54.360
 that they're forgotten much quicker in history.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.500
 I don't know, maybe that's because we haven't had

29:56.500 --> 30:00.180
 enough of them, but the De Niro performances,

30:00.180 --> 30:04.260
 and the Scorsese films, all the great films

30:04.260 --> 30:07.300
 that we think of throughout the generations

30:07.300 --> 30:10.280
 that define generations are films.

30:10.280 --> 30:12.980
 Is that just old school thinking?

30:12.980 --> 30:14.100
 Is that always going to be the case?

30:14.100 --> 30:19.100
 I mean, look, to me, going in a darkened theater

30:20.060 --> 30:23.220
 with a bunch of strangers, and the lights go down,

30:23.220 --> 30:28.020
 and you go on this journey, there is something special

30:28.020 --> 30:29.980
 and magical about that.

30:29.980 --> 30:33.460
 And I think movies have been a part

30:33.460 --> 30:36.060
 of our cultural fabric forever.

30:36.060 --> 30:39.420
 And for some reason, Hollywood in America

30:40.340 --> 30:45.340
 was uniquely positioned to do a great job with it.

30:46.260 --> 30:48.060
 Not that there aren't great foreign movies,

30:48.060 --> 30:53.060
 but far and away, American movies dominate,

30:53.060 --> 30:55.580
 not only the world market, but you know,

30:55.580 --> 30:58.260
 and so whatever it is that we do well,

30:58.260 --> 31:02.540
 or Hollywood does well, there's something

31:02.540 --> 31:03.540
 in the water, apparently.

31:03.540 --> 31:07.820
 But I agree that I love movies,

31:07.820 --> 31:10.540
 and I will for the rest of my days.

31:10.540 --> 31:13.420
 It's interesting how creators can move

31:13.420 --> 31:15.580
 back and forth now as well.

31:15.580 --> 31:17.260
 That used to be a complete no no.

31:17.260 --> 31:20.140
 You're either a movie guy, or you're a person,

31:20.140 --> 31:24.580
 or you're a TV director, and that's that.

31:24.580 --> 31:27.620
 But those lines have completely blurred.

31:27.620 --> 31:29.700
 And they're also blurring, I mean,

31:29.700 --> 31:31.100
 they're blurring all kinds of lines.

31:31.100 --> 31:35.180
 Like they're moving to TikTok and Instagram,

31:35.180 --> 31:38.580
 and I know right now it seems ridiculous

31:38.580 --> 31:42.700
 to consider that these one minute things

31:43.660 --> 31:47.300
 could be considered even in the same realm creatively

31:47.300 --> 31:50.580
 as a film, but maybe that changes over time too.

31:50.580 --> 31:53.220
 Maybe experiences can completely become fluid

31:53.220 --> 31:56.780
 in terms of their size, as long as they have

31:56.780 --> 32:01.100
 some deep lasting impact on you as a human being,

32:01.100 --> 32:02.160
 as a consumer.

32:02.160 --> 32:06.300
 Look, to me, the whole thing is about

32:06.300 --> 32:09.100
 either the moving image, or even sometimes a picture

32:09.980 --> 32:13.440
 will bring out an emotion, a reaction, something.

32:13.440 --> 32:18.260
 So short form is harder, because you have less time

32:18.260 --> 32:19.540
 to set things up and all that.

32:19.540 --> 32:22.820
 But I'm sure there will be short videos

32:22.820 --> 32:24.580
 and creators that come up with things,

32:24.580 --> 32:29.540
 and if a moving image can get a reaction out of you,

32:29.540 --> 32:31.140
 and make you feel a certain way,

32:31.140 --> 32:33.780
 and stay with you, or inspire you,

32:33.780 --> 32:36.400
 well, that to me is just the next evolution

32:36.400 --> 32:39.140
 of whatever it's gonna be between humans

32:39.140 --> 32:41.060
 and cameras, et cetera.

32:41.060 --> 32:44.700
 See, I think that's why we've talked offline about this.

32:44.700 --> 32:47.940
 That's why I love robots, is I think there's certain things

32:47.940 --> 32:51.180
 in the short form with robots that immediately

32:51.180 --> 32:54.000
 can bring out a feeling in people.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.520
 There's something about our consideration

32:57.520 --> 33:01.140
 of our own intelligence, of our own consciousness,

33:01.140 --> 33:04.820
 of all the fears and hopes, and the beautiful things

33:04.820 --> 33:07.820
 about human nature, the dark things about human nature

33:07.820 --> 33:11.780
 that somehow, especially Lego robots bring out.

33:11.780 --> 33:15.380
 Because we have both a fear and excitement towards that.

33:15.380 --> 33:17.380
 Are these going to be our overlords,

33:17.380 --> 33:20.760
 our gods that overtake humanity?

33:20.760 --> 33:24.380
 Are these going to be things like horses

33:24.380 --> 33:27.140
 or something like that, something that empower humanity?

33:27.140 --> 33:28.980
 Like you don't know what to make sense of it.

33:28.980 --> 33:30.900
 That's why they're super exciting.

33:30.900 --> 33:31.740
 I agree.

33:31.740 --> 33:35.120
 Speaking of robots and film, you've gone

33:35.120 --> 33:38.060
 into traditional industries and disrupted them

33:38.060 --> 33:39.460
 quite a few times.

33:40.300 --> 33:43.060
 Was there, is there a system for deciding

33:43.060 --> 33:45.780
 which industry is right for disruption?

33:45.780 --> 33:49.020
 When you look at the world and see

33:49.020 --> 33:52.460
 what are the big problems you would like to solve,

33:53.740 --> 33:56.580
 do you have a system of how you see which problems to solve?

33:56.580 --> 33:58.960
 How do you look at the world?

33:58.960 --> 34:01.400
 Yeah, well, on the business side of that,

34:02.420 --> 34:04.580
 so I have a holding company called Tolko,

34:04.580 --> 34:07.380
 I know, very imaginatively named.

34:07.380 --> 34:11.540
 Part of that is literally every name ever is now taken,

34:11.540 --> 34:13.220
 registered and all that stuff.

34:14.380 --> 34:16.820
 So we're a holding company.

34:16.820 --> 34:18.020
 What's a holding company?

34:18.020 --> 34:21.360
 So instead of being a fund that has money flowing

34:21.360 --> 34:24.940
 in and out of it, and there's what's called a vintage year,

34:24.940 --> 34:28.620
 I raise capital and I agree to invest that capital

34:28.620 --> 34:30.720
 for so long, and then I give it back to you,

34:30.720 --> 34:33.700
 which sometimes creates artificial time pressures

34:33.700 --> 34:34.540
 and things like that.

34:34.540 --> 34:38.140
 A holding company is more permanent capital.

34:38.140 --> 34:41.460
 So the idea was, behind Tolko,

34:41.460 --> 34:44.820
 was to buy almost always whole companies

34:44.820 --> 34:47.880
 or majority stakes with great management teams

34:47.880 --> 34:50.300
 in spaces that did not traditionally

34:50.300 --> 34:52.100
 have a lot of innovation.

34:53.240 --> 34:57.700
 And to have our labs group, who were data scientists,

34:57.700 --> 35:02.700
 AI practitioners, engineers, machine learning, et cetera,

35:02.700 --> 35:07.340
 and to be able to bring that wherewithal to that company.

35:07.340 --> 35:10.400
 So to provide them with the right capital

35:10.400 --> 35:13.340
 and to provide them with access to technology,

35:13.340 --> 35:17.820
 that would be hard to individually recruit for that company.

35:17.820 --> 35:22.460
 So I would say that the thesis was to look

35:22.460 --> 35:24.820
 for industries that were large enough,

35:24.820 --> 35:27.220
 that hadn't traditionally had access

35:27.220 --> 35:30.480
 to that type of technology or innovation,

35:30.480 --> 35:34.460
 and to try to look for companies that not only

35:35.700 --> 35:38.780
 looked that part, but had management teams

35:38.780 --> 35:41.980
 that embraced this and wanted to take that kind of journey.

35:41.980 --> 35:44.740
 Yeah, there is quite a few industries like that,

35:44.740 --> 35:49.740
 but that finding the industries and the management pair,

35:52.060 --> 35:54.060
 because those industries often have

35:54.060 --> 35:56.360
 a lot of old school folks who don't,

35:57.660 --> 35:59.100
 it takes quite a bit of work for them

35:59.100 --> 36:00.860
 to leap into technology.

36:00.860 --> 36:03.620
 I work quite a bit with the autonomous vehicles

36:03.620 --> 36:06.040
 and just the automotive industry.

36:06.040 --> 36:08.840
 Depending on the company, there's old school folks.

36:08.840 --> 36:11.380
 It's like Detroit thinking versus like,

36:11.380 --> 36:14.360
 what do you call it, I don't know, California thinking.

36:15.220 --> 36:18.780
 Well, I think you have to look at the nexus

36:18.780 --> 36:19.620
 of two things there.

36:19.620 --> 36:22.620
 One is just plain old human behavior.

36:22.620 --> 36:27.620
 If I am uncomfortable and this isn't a comfort zone for me

36:27.620 --> 36:31.180
 and it's not something I have as a field of expertise,

36:31.180 --> 36:33.260
 I'm gonna shy away from that.

36:33.260 --> 36:36.700
 Especially if I'm successful and I feel good about myself

36:36.700 --> 36:38.660
 and it's a big successful company or person

36:38.660 --> 36:39.860
 or whatever it might be.

36:41.540 --> 36:44.780
 And the second thing is that especially

36:44.780 --> 36:46.580
 if you're a public company and you're being weighed

36:46.580 --> 36:49.580
 and measured every quarter, you are rewarding

36:49.580 --> 36:53.420
 the managers of that company to hit metrics

36:53.420 --> 36:55.620
 and to be reliable and to say, hey,

36:55.620 --> 36:57.260
 I'm counting quarter to quarter

36:57.260 --> 36:59.760
 that you're gonna deliver what you say.

37:00.820 --> 37:03.380
 It's difficult to say, you know what, everybody,

37:03.380 --> 37:05.660
 for the next two years, I wouldn't count

37:05.660 --> 37:08.380
 on our financial projections at all

37:08.380 --> 37:10.740
 because we're gonna reinvent what we're doing.

37:10.740 --> 37:14.060
 It's gonna work in the long run and you're gonna see

37:14.060 --> 37:15.700
 that this was a really smart investment

37:15.700 --> 37:17.140
 five to seven years from now.

37:18.740 --> 37:22.800
 That's not the way capitalism is currently wired,

37:22.800 --> 37:24.280
 generally, right?

37:24.280 --> 37:28.180
 And a lot of, so again, if you reward managers

37:28.180 --> 37:30.540
 with yearly bonuses and stock options

37:30.540 --> 37:35.540
 based and tied to stock price and all these other things,

37:35.560 --> 37:38.260
 you know, and then ask them to go break stuff,

37:39.460 --> 37:41.140
 that's hard, I think.

37:41.140 --> 37:46.140
 So you're saying like, so the talker approach

37:46.500 --> 37:50.140
 to this, the private investment is the best way

37:50.140 --> 37:53.100
 or perhaps the only way to enable this kind

37:53.100 --> 37:55.260
 of long term innovation, investment,

37:55.260 --> 37:57.620
 taking big risks, investing in innovation.

37:57.620 --> 38:01.260
 Well, look, we certainly are not, by any means,

38:01.260 --> 38:02.340
 the only one doing it.

38:02.340 --> 38:06.460
 I'm just saying that when you think about big companies,

38:06.460 --> 38:10.900
 more successful, you know, that are in old line businesses,

38:10.900 --> 38:13.380
 and I hear people sort of talk about,

38:13.380 --> 38:15.140
 well, why can't they just pivot?

38:15.140 --> 38:19.380
 They recognize they need to be in the technology business

38:19.380 --> 38:23.140
 because it's hard, it's hard to steer a ship and turn it

38:23.140 --> 38:25.660
 that big, and especially if it's not part

38:25.660 --> 38:27.720
 of your DNA at that company.

38:28.700 --> 38:33.660
 So, you know, I just think that what we tried to do

38:33.660 --> 38:38.660
 is to enable management teams that know

38:38.980 --> 38:43.260
 where they wanna go and to be patient with capital

38:43.260 --> 38:48.260
 and also, again, bring innovation to bear

38:48.260 --> 38:50.700
 that they have access to.

38:50.700 --> 38:52.660
 There's plenty of capital structures

38:52.660 --> 38:54.360
 doing interesting things.

38:54.360 --> 38:57.500
 That's one of the things I love about our country.

38:57.500 --> 39:01.700
 This country innovates and this country invents things,

39:01.700 --> 39:06.700
 and I'm constantly in awe of just the, you know,

39:08.460 --> 39:13.460
 the human ability to innovate and to iterate.

39:14.500 --> 39:18.020
 You know, I get to hang around some universities,

39:18.020 --> 39:20.580
 including your old shop, MIT, and it's like.

39:20.580 --> 39:21.420
 I'm still there.

39:21.420 --> 39:22.240
 Yeah, you're still there.

39:22.240 --> 39:23.180
 Still there, still teaching there.

39:23.180 --> 39:26.180
 Still teaching, but that place is like Hogwarts.

39:26.180 --> 39:30.680
 I mean, it's just, it's inspiring, right?

39:30.680 --> 39:34.060
 And certainly the energy in Silicon Valley,

39:34.060 --> 39:37.420
 which now Austin, Texas, where we're sitting,

39:37.420 --> 39:40.740
 has its own incredible ecosystem.

39:40.740 --> 39:45.060
 So that's one of the things I love about America

39:45.060 --> 39:49.180
 is the ability, and that really is, I think,

39:49.180 --> 39:53.700
 in the American DNA, to create things and invent things,

39:53.700 --> 39:55.940
 and I just, I think that's invigorating.

39:55.940 --> 39:58.220
 And I think that's even bigger than capitalism,

39:58.220 --> 40:01.460
 sort of the machine of how capitalism works.

40:01.460 --> 40:02.900
 That's just human nature.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.580
 Capitalism is just one of the ways

40:04.580 --> 40:09.580
 to sort of make that human nature shine, I suppose,

40:10.020 --> 40:12.840
 but it's like, you mentioned MIT.

40:12.840 --> 40:17.840
 There's a drive there to invent, to innovate,

40:20.280 --> 40:25.280
 that's so purely human, that human spirit

40:25.720 --> 40:28.160
 to sort of build something new.

40:28.160 --> 40:30.200
 It's like that hopeful, optimistic spirit,

40:30.200 --> 40:32.080
 especially in the engineering space.

40:32.080 --> 40:33.640
 Like if you pay attention to the internet,

40:33.640 --> 40:36.240
 like Twitter and all that kind of stuff,

40:36.240 --> 40:39.480
 intellectuals and so on, there's a cynicism

40:39.480 --> 40:43.320
 to when we talk about stuff,

40:43.320 --> 40:46.900
 but there's an optimism to when we do stuff.

40:46.900 --> 40:49.880
 And the doing part, when you actually build things,

40:49.880 --> 40:52.880
 especially, like you care a lot about manufacturing too,

40:52.880 --> 40:55.840
 like you actually build physical products,

40:55.840 --> 40:59.280
 that's where we truly shine.

40:59.280 --> 41:01.040
 Yeah, no question about it.

41:01.040 --> 41:06.040
 And I'm passionate about our country making stuff again,

41:06.040 --> 41:11.040
 doing our own manufacturing and making sure

41:11.960 --> 41:14.020
 that we don't lose the ability,

41:14.020 --> 41:17.960
 not just to create things intellectually

41:17.960 --> 41:19.520
 and do the world's greatest blueprints,

41:19.520 --> 41:22.080
 but actually make things here.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.080
 Actual factories.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.280
 Yeah, that's exactly right.

41:24.280 --> 41:26.120
 How do we do that?

41:26.120 --> 41:30.640
 How do we bring more manufacturing to the United States?

41:30.640 --> 41:34.880
 Well, there's a company that I have a big personal investment

41:34.880 --> 41:39.440
 in called Rebuild with some folks

41:39.440 --> 41:44.440
 that all went through the MIT school years ago.

41:45.120 --> 41:47.160
 There's a good friend of mine named Jeff Wilkie

41:47.160 --> 41:49.720
 who used to be at Amazon.

41:49.720 --> 41:54.280
 And we all felt the same way that America needed

41:54.280 --> 41:56.600
 to make sure that it didn't lose its edge in that way.

41:56.600 --> 42:00.280
 So it's a company that invests

42:00.280 --> 42:03.380
 in American high tech manufacturing.

42:03.380 --> 42:07.500
 And I think the way that we do that is provide capital,

42:07.500 --> 42:09.620
 provide training.

42:09.620 --> 42:12.300
 To me, this is also fertile ground for good,

42:12.300 --> 42:14.320
 sustainable, high paying jobs.

42:16.340 --> 42:21.340
 And we have to make it economically feasible to do that,

42:21.980 --> 42:24.100
 again, here in this country.

42:24.100 --> 42:26.500
 And not to say to companies that, again,

42:26.500 --> 42:28.820
 are being weighed and measured quarter by quarter.

42:28.820 --> 42:31.480
 Hey, this is three times as expensive to do it here,

42:31.480 --> 42:33.140
 but you should do it here.

42:33.140 --> 42:36.940
 We need to innovate and we need to create processes

42:36.940 --> 42:41.940
 and companies and opportunity that balance that equation.

42:42.100 --> 42:44.440
 And I think as we saw during the pandemic,

42:45.860 --> 42:48.700
 I don't think in this day and age you can be an isolationist.

42:48.700 --> 42:51.460
 That doesn't make any sense to me.

42:51.460 --> 42:54.860
 But being self reliant and self determinant

42:54.860 --> 42:59.860
 and making sure that you are never in a position as a nation

43:00.420 --> 43:01.860
 that we can't do basic things

43:01.860 --> 43:05.320
 because we're relying on supply chain in other countries.

43:05.320 --> 43:09.360
 And whether it's we're not friends anymore,

43:09.360 --> 43:13.940
 or a natural disaster or a virus or something pops up,

43:13.940 --> 43:17.180
 I think those are costs of doing business

43:17.180 --> 43:20.020
 that we have to put into the calculus

43:20.020 --> 43:22.860
 of being able to make things here.

43:22.860 --> 43:25.520
 There's an extremely high cost to making supply chain

43:25.520 --> 43:27.860
 resilient that we really have to consider.

43:27.860 --> 43:31.500
 And so if you really consider that cost,

43:31.500 --> 43:34.140
 it makes a lot of sense to invest especially long term

43:34.140 --> 43:37.020
 in building up manufacturing in a way

43:37.020 --> 43:40.380
 where like you're making most of the stuff in one place.

43:40.380 --> 43:44.940
 Sort of bringing it all, not all,

43:44.940 --> 43:47.000
 but as much in as possible.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.860
 And building it almost like from scratch

43:49.860 --> 43:50.840
 here in the United States.

43:50.840 --> 43:55.840
 I mean, what I guess your thought is with innovation,

43:57.500 --> 43:59.660
 it's possible to sort of revolutionize

43:59.660 --> 44:00.900
 the way we do manufacturing.

44:00.900 --> 44:03.580
 So reduce the amount of supply chain stuff

44:03.580 --> 44:05.260
 and like build stuff from scratch.

44:05.260 --> 44:08.780
 Like do high tech manufacturing.

44:08.780 --> 44:11.740
 So like optimize all aspects of the manufacturing

44:11.740 --> 44:13.640
 and all that kind of stuff.

44:13.640 --> 44:18.640
 Yeah, and I think where technology is the most efficient

44:19.940 --> 44:23.780
 is the human machine interface, right?

44:23.780 --> 44:25.480
 It's not let's automate everything

44:25.480 --> 44:27.140
 and have nobody work anywhere.

44:27.140 --> 44:32.140
 I, for a long time, that's neither feasible nor desirable.

44:32.380 --> 44:35.620
 But where we can enhance jobs

44:37.380 --> 44:41.380
 and make that interface immensely productive

44:42.340 --> 44:43.900
 with the right training and so forth,

44:43.900 --> 44:46.260
 I think that's a worthwhile endeavor

44:46.260 --> 44:49.180
 and something that's gonna be important to our country.

44:49.180 --> 44:53.100
 Yeah, I mean, you know who you're talking to.

44:53.100 --> 44:55.880
 I love human robot interaction, human machine interaction,

44:55.880 --> 44:57.260
 human AI interaction.

44:57.260 --> 44:59.100
 So what do you think is the role of robotics

44:59.100 --> 45:02.100
 in this high tech manufacturing?

45:02.100 --> 45:04.380
 Sort of like industrial robots, robotic arms,

45:04.380 --> 45:06.380
 all that kind of stuff.

45:06.380 --> 45:09.380
 Or even more complicated kind of robots.

45:09.380 --> 45:11.640
 What do you think is the role of robotics?

45:11.640 --> 45:13.220
 What do you think is the role of AI

45:13.220 --> 45:16.220
 in this manufacturing future you're thinking about?

45:16.220 --> 45:20.340
 Well, robotics to me is an extremely exciting field.

45:20.340 --> 45:23.060
 I don't have the same expertise that you do.

45:23.060 --> 45:26.000
 I have an adjacency, but not the depth of knowledge.

45:27.260 --> 45:29.160
 Have never really delved deeply into it

45:29.160 --> 45:30.380
 or made investments in it.

45:30.380 --> 45:32.500
 But I think what's exciting about it

45:32.500 --> 45:34.980
 is everything from doing jobs

45:34.980 --> 45:37.420
 that are very dangerous for humans,

45:38.700 --> 45:41.540
 enhancing the human experience.

45:41.540 --> 45:44.900
 When you look at really repetitive labor,

45:44.900 --> 45:49.060
 things that, you know, it might take away a job,

45:49.060 --> 45:51.540
 but is it a good job for that person?

45:51.540 --> 45:53.300
 Is, you know, spending 30 years

45:53.300 --> 45:55.140
 doing something highly repetitious,

45:55.140 --> 45:58.980
 is that a good experience in life?

45:58.980 --> 46:02.500
 So I think, and then when you think about everything

46:02.500 --> 46:06.940
 from military applications, you know, rescue,

46:06.940 --> 46:08.980
 we're already seeing a bunch of those things.

46:08.980 --> 46:11.640
 And then just lastly,

46:11.640 --> 46:15.140
 when you talk about that human interaction with robots,

46:15.140 --> 46:17.940
 when you start to have the combination,

46:17.940 --> 46:22.220
 so you have some level of intelligence and interaction,

46:22.220 --> 46:25.740
 I mean, that's why we always love the droids

46:25.740 --> 46:26.780
 in Star Wars, right?

46:26.780 --> 46:31.780
 I mean, it's exciting, it captures the imagination.

46:33.780 --> 46:38.780
 And I think, look, many, many hours have been spent

46:39.500 --> 46:42.740
 on debating artificial intelligence

46:42.740 --> 46:47.740
 and the ramifications, if things go sideways and so forth.

46:48.100 --> 46:50.580
 And I think those are all, you know,

46:50.580 --> 46:54.180
 those are appropriate conversations to be having.

46:54.180 --> 46:55.980
 AI is happening.

46:55.980 --> 46:57.960
 I think it's actually happening slower

46:57.960 --> 46:59.500
 than most people realize,

47:01.580 --> 47:04.580
 because there are tasks that humans do

47:04.580 --> 47:06.700
 every minute of every day,

47:06.700 --> 47:09.620
 standing up without losing your sense of balance.

47:09.620 --> 47:12.820
 I mean, these are really hard things,

47:12.820 --> 47:16.660
 but I think there's enough investment,

47:16.660 --> 47:19.820
 both in private industry as well as nation states now

47:19.820 --> 47:22.660
 on artificial intelligence that it is coming.

47:23.880 --> 47:27.340
 So both in the software space, in the digital space

47:27.340 --> 47:29.100
 and in the physical space.

47:29.100 --> 47:30.620
 So we talk about manufacturing,

47:30.620 --> 47:33.820
 so industrial robotics is very true

47:33.820 --> 47:36.380
 that even in the factory, even the tasks that you think

47:36.380 --> 47:40.980
 are pretty basic, you know,

47:40.980 --> 47:45.100
 the amount of small intuitive decisions that humans make

47:45.100 --> 47:46.540
 is quite incredible.

47:46.540 --> 47:49.740
 So we have to be kind of explicit about saying

47:49.740 --> 47:52.140
 which tasks are actually really hard

47:52.140 --> 47:54.660
 and humans are just really good at them.

47:54.660 --> 47:59.260
 And so on the flip side in the digital space

47:59.260 --> 48:01.620
 with social networks, we recommend our systems

48:01.620 --> 48:04.740
 with all kinds of like personal assistance

48:04.740 --> 48:09.740
 in terms of voice based AI systems, all of that.

48:10.340 --> 48:13.140
 There's opportunities there to find niches

48:13.140 --> 48:17.260
 where AI can really have a transformative effect.

48:17.260 --> 48:22.180
 I think one of the places that really haven't,

48:25.080 --> 48:27.420
 this is where like you're worried to say stupid things,

48:27.420 --> 48:32.260
 but I believe this very much that when we have AI systems

48:32.260 --> 48:34.620
 in the home currently, you have somebody like Alexa

48:34.620 --> 48:36.500
 and Google Home and so on,

48:36.500 --> 48:40.820
 they're kind of very basic servants.

48:40.820 --> 48:43.220
 They tell you about the weather, they can play some music,

48:43.220 --> 48:45.060
 they can turn the lights on and off,

48:45.060 --> 48:47.620
 all the kind of like smart home stuff.

48:47.620 --> 48:51.380
 I think there's a lot of value in systems

48:51.380 --> 48:55.060
 that form relationships with us

48:55.060 --> 48:58.980
 in the way that pets do, dogs and cats.

48:58.980 --> 49:01.340
 I don't know, just for people who have cats,

49:01.340 --> 49:02.500
 cats don't care about you.

49:02.500 --> 49:05.140
 They really don't, they don't form any kind of relationship.

49:05.140 --> 49:07.060
 I don't know why you have relationship with them.

49:07.060 --> 49:08.260
 It's one way.

49:08.260 --> 49:11.940
 Anyway, sorry, I threw out some shade.

49:11.940 --> 49:13.200
 I'm just kidding by the way.

49:13.200 --> 49:14.940
 That's a basic kind of connection you have

49:14.940 --> 49:16.940
 with another living being.

49:16.940 --> 49:18.440
 Then there's also just friends.

49:18.440 --> 49:20.060
 You have different levels of friends,

49:20.060 --> 49:22.580
 acquaintances, you have lifelong friends, all that.

49:22.580 --> 49:26.460
 That friendship you have, I really believe

49:26.460 --> 49:29.740
 that there is some aspect of the human experience

49:29.740 --> 49:34.740
 that is deeply enriched by interacting with other beings.

49:35.420 --> 49:40.300
 And for systems, computing systems,

49:40.300 --> 49:43.060
 artificial intelligence systems in our world,

49:44.220 --> 49:46.940
 to have the capability to engage in some of that,

49:46.940 --> 49:49.020
 I think is not just an opportunity

49:49.020 --> 49:53.580
 to help people grow, become better people,

49:53.580 --> 49:56.100
 but it's also just a good business opportunity too.

49:56.100 --> 49:58.540
 And that hasn't really been explored enough.

49:58.540 --> 50:02.260
 So that to me is really, that's a whole exciting space

50:02.260 --> 50:07.260
 that I think will enable better industrial robotics.

50:08.660 --> 50:11.460
 It will empower a better Facebook

50:11.460 --> 50:14.300
 or a better social network, a competitor to Facebook

50:14.300 --> 50:15.740
 that overthrows Facebook.

50:15.740 --> 50:19.660
 So it'll create better technologies

50:19.660 --> 50:24.340
 that currently don't have that human robot interaction touch.

50:24.340 --> 50:27.740
 So I don't know, that's super exciting to me,

50:27.740 --> 50:32.740
 but that has to deal with the mess of human nature.

50:34.420 --> 50:36.980
 The reason that most robotics people

50:36.980 --> 50:39.280
 and AI people stay away from humans,

50:40.820 --> 50:43.900
 they stay away from the human robot interaction problem,

50:43.900 --> 50:46.300
 is because humans are complicated.

50:46.300 --> 50:49.180
 They're messy, they're hard to control,

50:49.180 --> 50:54.180
 they're hard to predict stuff about,

50:54.180 --> 50:58.680
 they're hard to make sense of or like test repeatedly

50:58.680 --> 51:01.840
 because one human can be drastically different

51:01.840 --> 51:02.960
 from another human.

51:02.960 --> 51:05.200
 And so to deal with that as a robotics problem

51:05.200 --> 51:06.120
 is super hard.

51:07.240 --> 51:11.760
 And so one of the questions is which problems

51:11.760 --> 51:14.080
 can you remove the human from consideration

51:14.080 --> 51:15.580
 when you're trying to solve the problem?

51:15.580 --> 51:17.720
 So like Elon Musk is an example of somebody

51:17.720 --> 51:20.540
 who believes autonomous driving,

51:20.540 --> 51:23.160
 we can remove the human from consideration,

51:23.160 --> 51:26.440
 we can solve autonomous driving as a robotics problem.

51:26.440 --> 51:28.360
 It's stay in the lane.

51:28.360 --> 51:31.520
 When there's a red light, you stop at a red light.

51:31.520 --> 51:34.560
 If there is humans in the picture like pedestrians,

51:34.560 --> 51:36.520
 that's a ballistics problem.

51:36.520 --> 51:39.540
 It's just treat them as a moving object

51:39.540 --> 51:42.640
 that has with like 90% probability

51:42.640 --> 51:45.840
 keeps moving in the way they were in the past few seconds

51:45.840 --> 51:49.280
 with some smaller probability that might stop or turn.

51:49.280 --> 51:51.480
 Just do some basic models about them

51:51.480 --> 51:53.280
 and you'll be able to do just fine.

51:53.280 --> 51:57.140
 So I tend to believe that even driving

51:58.040 --> 52:01.060
 has to consider the full messiness of humans.

52:01.060 --> 52:03.880
 The dance, the game theoretic dance of chicken

52:03.880 --> 52:07.440
 that we all do when we jaywalk,

52:07.440 --> 52:10.100
 we look at the car, that car doesn't,

52:10.100 --> 52:12.100
 that driver doesn't have the guts to murder me

52:12.100 --> 52:14.560
 so I'm going to walk in front of it and not look at the car.

52:14.560 --> 52:17.520
 We do that kind of dance and AI systems

52:17.520 --> 52:22.100
 need to be able to play, do that kind of dance.

52:24.160 --> 52:28.480
 In Tolko, there's the labs.

52:28.480 --> 52:32.280
 So there's a data science component, there's an AI component.

52:32.280 --> 52:35.800
 So how do they go into a company

52:35.800 --> 52:38.120
 and help revolutionize that industry?

52:38.120 --> 52:39.840
 Well, there's different examples.

52:39.840 --> 52:44.840
 So one of our companies, Figs, makes healthcare workwear,

52:44.840 --> 52:47.440
 started by these two brilliant women

52:47.440 --> 52:52.440
 and early days helping to build the platform and recruit

52:54.240 --> 52:59.240
 and make sure that everything that we did

52:59.680 --> 53:03.200
 at the company embraced technology

53:03.200 --> 53:05.880
 and at the same time, they were obsessive

53:05.880 --> 53:09.760
 about their customer, which is doctors, nurses,

53:09.760 --> 53:12.440
 healthcare workers who are putting it on the line every day

53:12.440 --> 53:13.960
 and obsessive about their product.

53:13.960 --> 53:17.200
 And when you have those two things come together,

53:17.200 --> 53:22.200
 you get the result that we did at Figs.

53:24.560 --> 53:26.640
 We have a company called Acashure,

53:26.640 --> 53:31.440
 which it's AI lab and base is down here in Austin, Texas.

53:31.440 --> 53:33.600
 It was an insurance,

53:33.600 --> 53:36.600
 one of the largest insurance brokers in the world.

53:36.600 --> 53:40.840
 And we did a deal with them

53:40.840 --> 53:44.360
 and sold some of our insurance holdings

53:44.360 --> 53:46.480
 that was completely AI driven.

53:47.760 --> 53:50.680
 And in that case, you basically put the team

53:50.680 --> 53:52.680
 inside the company, right?

53:52.680 --> 53:56.080
 Because it's a massive company

53:56.080 --> 53:58.080
 and we've gone into all kinds of things.

53:59.760 --> 54:03.760
 So it just depends on the different situations.

54:03.760 --> 54:06.560
 But the biggest thing was just to make sure

54:06.560 --> 54:08.120
 whatever the company needed,

54:08.120 --> 54:11.880
 they had access to the talent.

54:11.880 --> 54:15.440
 Sometimes we'd build it, sometimes we'd help recruit for it.

54:15.440 --> 54:18.480
 You know how in technology, it's whatever works, right?

54:18.480 --> 54:22.200
 There's no one way to do things.

54:22.200 --> 54:25.760
 Well, Acashure is really interesting as an example.

54:25.760 --> 54:27.560
 So insurance is a fascinating space.

54:27.560 --> 54:30.320
 It seems like very ripe still

54:30.320 --> 54:32.600
 for disruption across the board.

54:32.600 --> 54:35.560
 So how do you, it seems like a lot of the disruption

54:35.560 --> 54:40.560
 has to do with almost the first dump step

54:42.040 --> 54:44.800
 of we've been using mostly paper.

54:46.040 --> 54:47.840
 It's not digitized.

54:47.840 --> 54:51.600
 You have to basically create a infrastructure

54:51.600 --> 54:53.520
 and a framework where everybody is using

54:53.520 --> 54:56.840
 the same digital system, like databases

54:56.840 --> 54:59.000
 and just organize the data.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.280
 It seems like that's a huge leap

55:01.280 --> 55:03.960
 that basically can revolutionize major industries

55:03.960 --> 55:05.480
 that still hasn't been done.

55:05.480 --> 55:08.000
 Insurance is obviously the great example of that.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.760
 And one of the things that struck me,

55:10.760 --> 55:14.040
 the founder CEO of Acashure is a guy named Greg Williams.

55:14.040 --> 55:16.160
 They're out of Grand Rapids, Michigan.

55:16.160 --> 55:18.480
 And as we were looking at expanding our footprint

55:18.480 --> 55:22.280
 in insurance, I met with a lot of insurance executives.

55:22.280 --> 55:24.320
 And they would talk about technology,

55:24.320 --> 55:28.840
 but Greg truly understood the power

55:28.840 --> 55:32.040
 of what would happen across actuarial sciences,

55:32.040 --> 55:37.040
 predictive analytics and using machine learning

55:37.280 --> 55:39.560
 to really run every aspect of your business.

55:39.560 --> 55:42.440
 And then automating a lot of the,

55:42.440 --> 55:45.560
 just the back office tedious steps.

55:45.560 --> 55:48.720
 And as you said, one of the things that was great for us,

55:48.720 --> 55:53.720
 they already had a data collection system and department.

55:54.600 --> 55:57.080
 So it was much easier to pivot.

55:58.040 --> 56:01.000
 And I'm very excited about the future of that company.

56:01.000 --> 56:06.000
 It's, they're doing some pretty innovative,

56:06.240 --> 56:07.440
 groundbreaking things.

56:07.440 --> 56:11.040
 And those are the things that I like doing, right?

56:11.040 --> 56:15.400
 Is that, yes, I wanna make money.

56:15.400 --> 56:17.320
 Just, that's what that is.

56:17.320 --> 56:19.000
 But at the same time,

56:19.000 --> 56:21.600
 what did you do with your time on earth, right?

56:21.600 --> 56:24.360
 Did you do anything to leave any kind of mark

56:24.360 --> 56:27.680
 that you did anything interesting?

56:27.680 --> 56:29.480
 I can only speak for myself.

56:29.480 --> 56:33.400
 There are many more ways to measure one's life.

56:33.400 --> 56:36.680
 And I can only speak about how I think about things.

56:37.920 --> 56:41.320
 I grew up poor in upstate New York with a single mom

56:41.320 --> 56:43.320
 and watched her work a couple of jobs

56:43.320 --> 56:48.320
 and had to, from a young age, shovel snow and mow lawns

56:49.680 --> 56:52.280
 and do all kinds of things to help her

56:52.280 --> 56:55.320
 make sure the lights weren't turned off in our little place.

56:55.320 --> 56:57.360
 And so that's just something

56:57.360 --> 57:00.280
 that I've always been driven towards.

57:00.280 --> 57:05.280
 And I just, I have really eclectic tastes and interests.

57:07.120 --> 57:11.320
 And it's just been an interesting journey.

57:11.320 --> 57:14.800
 So help be part of and help enable

57:14.800 --> 57:19.800
 some cool new creations across the board,

57:19.880 --> 57:24.880
 like film, music, AI, manufacturing,

57:24.880 --> 57:29.880
 just insurance, all the specific industries

57:31.160 --> 57:33.200
 that you disrupted, yeah.

57:33.200 --> 57:38.200
 Small tangent, back to your childhood with your mom.

57:39.240 --> 57:42.680
 Any memories kind of stand out,

57:42.680 --> 57:46.040
 stick with you as something

57:46.040 --> 57:49.160
 that helped define who you are as a man?

57:49.160 --> 57:53.280
 Yeah, even though the university and college experience

57:53.280 --> 57:55.960
 was not part of the family tree,

57:58.160 --> 58:01.480
 and we had no connections, I didn't understand,

58:01.480 --> 58:03.800
 I didn't know what a trust fund was or prep school,

58:03.800 --> 58:05.560
 I didn't know what any of that was.

58:07.040 --> 58:10.920
 But my mom from a young age would always say,

58:10.920 --> 58:12.160
 you know, you're gonna go to college.

58:12.160 --> 58:15.320
 There's no, you know, if you choose to,

58:15.320 --> 58:17.000
 and I think from a young age,

58:17.000 --> 58:21.080
 that was just an expectation that I had

58:21.080 --> 58:23.240
 and that she instilled and the work ethic.

58:23.240 --> 58:24.720
 I watched her.

58:24.720 --> 58:28.920
 And then my grandmother was a janitor,

58:28.920 --> 58:31.800
 a cleaning lady in a hospital for 50 years.

58:31.800 --> 58:36.400
 And then I remember there were times of, you know,

58:36.400 --> 58:39.480
 I'm probably 10 years old, it's freezing cold out.

58:39.480 --> 58:42.840
 And if I don't go out and shovel six driveways,

58:42.840 --> 58:45.040
 we don't have enough money to pay the bill.

58:45.040 --> 58:48.400
 So I don't know, I'm not a psychologist,

58:48.400 --> 58:52.840
 so I don't know how that manifests itself in my life today.

58:52.840 --> 58:57.840
 But I think the grit to say,

58:57.880 --> 59:01.560
 I'm not in the mood to do this, I don't wanna do this,

59:01.560 --> 59:04.400
 but that's the work that needs to be done.

59:04.400 --> 59:08.400
 And no excuses, not I'm a victim

59:08.400 --> 59:10.240
 and I'm gonna sit around and talk about,

59:10.240 --> 59:12.200
 no, it is what it is,

59:12.200 --> 59:15.000
 and you have to get done what you need to get done.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.120
 And again, I think it's,

59:19.200 --> 59:22.400
 you can never fully put yourself in someone else's shoes

59:22.400 --> 59:25.440
 or experience, so I don't know what that is or feels like.

59:25.440 --> 59:28.600
 But for me, those were two, I think,

59:28.600 --> 59:33.600
 formative things that were important in my childhood.

59:33.800 --> 59:37.000
 So that's pretty, the reality of life like that

59:37.000 --> 59:38.360
 is pretty humbling.

59:38.360 --> 59:41.800
 You still, you've been so exceptionally successful

59:41.800 --> 59:45.120
 that it's easy to get soft now.

59:45.120 --> 59:48.320
 How do you get humbled these days?

59:49.240 --> 59:50.560
 By getting up.

59:50.560 --> 59:55.360
 You know, I think for me personally,

59:55.360 --> 59:57.360
 trying to push the envelope

59:57.360 --> 59:59.240
 and being weighed and measured, right?

59:59.240 --> 1:00:00.680
 That's why I always loved sports too.

1:00:00.680 --> 1:00:02.280
 There's a scoreboard.

1:00:02.280 --> 1:00:07.280
 And I'm a huge believer in opportunity, meritocracy,

1:00:07.920 --> 1:00:11.520
 all those things that I think are ideals

1:00:11.520 --> 1:00:14.680
 that we wanna aspire to.

1:00:14.680 --> 1:00:18.240
 And I think that there's a lot of things

1:00:18.240 --> 1:00:21.400
 I'm involved with right now that I just wanna see

1:00:21.400 --> 1:00:22.240
 if I can do it.

1:00:22.240 --> 1:00:26.360
 I wanna see if, and you know,

1:00:26.360 --> 1:00:29.640
 my own little mantra is cause the outcome, right?

1:00:29.640 --> 1:00:32.480
 As much as you can, and at the same time,

1:00:32.480 --> 1:00:36.080
 have the humility and not to have the hubris or arrogance

1:00:36.080 --> 1:00:38.920
 to say I'm always gonna cause the outcome.

1:00:38.920 --> 1:00:41.720
 Because you'll get your ass kicked pretty quickly

1:00:41.720 --> 1:00:43.040
 and humbled.

1:00:43.040 --> 1:00:45.160
 The world and the universe is a big place

1:00:45.160 --> 1:00:50.120
 with forces beyond, but I think,

1:00:52.600 --> 1:00:56.160
 I also think a lot about being intellectually honest,

1:00:56.160 --> 1:00:59.480
 which when I do university talks and so forth,

1:00:59.480 --> 1:01:02.680
 I think that's a superpower.

1:01:02.680 --> 1:01:06.560
 Because if you find yourself making decisions

1:01:06.560 --> 1:01:10.040
 based on other people's expectations,

1:01:10.040 --> 1:01:13.280
 based on places you don't wanna go,

1:01:13.280 --> 1:01:18.280
 but you feel like momentum is taking you there,

1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:22.160
 I think that's a big problem.

1:01:22.160 --> 1:01:26.960
 And there are people that go to our top universities

1:01:26.960 --> 1:01:30.600
 and can't wait to get out and start their own company

1:01:30.600 --> 1:01:35.160
 and they want that pressure and they want to grind.

1:01:35.160 --> 1:01:38.520
 And there are other people that are smart and talented,

1:01:38.520 --> 1:01:41.080
 but just say, look, I don't wanna lay awake

1:01:41.080 --> 1:01:42.400
 staring at the ceiling wondering

1:01:42.400 --> 1:01:43.680
 how I'm gonna make payroll.

1:01:43.680 --> 1:01:45.480
 I don't want that in my life.

1:01:45.480 --> 1:01:48.600
 And I think if you can square that up

1:01:48.600 --> 1:01:51.240
 and be okay with it and say, what makes me tick?

1:01:51.240 --> 1:01:52.800
 What makes me happy?

1:01:52.800 --> 1:01:54.680
 What puts me in a bad head space?

1:01:54.680 --> 1:01:57.920
 Because there's a difference between challenging yourself

1:01:57.920 --> 1:02:00.080
 and going against your nature.

1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:03.000
 So that's why I think that being intellectually honest

1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.320
 and being able to really sit down

1:02:05.320 --> 1:02:08.000
 and go inside your own head and say,

1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:08.840
 what am I good at?

1:02:08.840 --> 1:02:10.480
 What am I not good at?

1:02:10.480 --> 1:02:12.320
 How am I gonna put myself in a position

1:02:12.320 --> 1:02:13.760
 to be successful?

1:02:13.760 --> 1:02:17.440
 Because I'm working on my weaknesses,

1:02:17.440 --> 1:02:21.840
 but I'm not gonna put myself career wise in a position

1:02:21.840 --> 1:02:24.840
 where I'm just fundamentally gonna have a hard time

1:02:24.840 --> 1:02:25.840
 being successful.

1:02:28.200 --> 1:02:30.120
 Yeah, intellectually honest is a tricky one.

1:02:30.120 --> 1:02:34.320
 And it gets, there's like levels to it too.

1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:35.840
 Sure.

1:02:35.840 --> 1:02:40.280
 Because some of the things I think about

1:02:40.280 --> 1:02:45.280
 when you dream of doing certain kinds of big things,

1:02:49.320 --> 1:02:53.560
 a part of intellectual honesty is to say several things.

1:02:53.560 --> 1:02:58.320
 One is like, hey, the thing you're dreaming about,

1:02:59.320 --> 1:03:02.960
 like one, the fact that nobody's done it

1:03:02.960 --> 1:03:07.960
 probably shows that you're just a dreamer.

1:03:07.960 --> 1:03:12.960
 This is not going to, like think clearly.

1:03:13.080 --> 1:03:14.280
 The fact that it hasn't been done

1:03:14.280 --> 1:03:17.480
 probably shows that it may not be the right path.

1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:21.680
 And two is like, if you're dreaming about stuff,

1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:23.680
 there's a certain point where it's like,

1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:25.840
 hey, you haven't done it.

1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:27.760
 Like, why haven't you done it already then?

1:03:27.760 --> 1:03:29.200
 Like you have to be honest with yourself.

1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:30.480
 Like you have to be ambitious.

1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:35.480
 Like a lot of people work hard a long time for a dream,

1:03:35.480 --> 1:03:38.920
 but you have to wake up and be like, all right,

1:03:38.920 --> 1:03:41.000
 I've been at this for 10 years.

1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:43.240
 Like with a startup, you launch a startup

1:03:43.240 --> 1:03:46.800
 and you think, okay, one year, two years,

1:03:46.800 --> 1:03:49.080
 three years, four years, pretty successful,

1:03:49.080 --> 1:03:50.840
 but it hasn't exploded like you dreamed

1:03:50.840 --> 1:03:54.120
 and you have to shut it down.

1:03:54.120 --> 1:03:56.000
 You have to be intellectually honest there.

1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:59.200
 At the same time, you might want to be,

1:04:01.080 --> 1:04:03.060
 like step it up, lean into it.

1:04:03.060 --> 1:04:08.060
 Say almost like the flip side of like intellectual honesty

1:04:10.140 --> 1:04:14.980
 is like maddening ambition of just saying, fuck it,

1:04:14.980 --> 1:04:16.940
 I'm going to go all in.

1:04:16.940 --> 1:04:19.820
 But that is a kind of intellectual honesty saying like,

1:04:19.820 --> 1:04:23.140
 you know, the big problem here is I've been kind of going,

1:04:23.140 --> 1:04:24.400
 doing too many things.

1:04:26.180 --> 1:04:29.940
 Maybe with this dream, you have to go all in on it.

1:04:29.940 --> 1:04:30.780
 All those kinds of things.

1:04:30.780 --> 1:04:33.280
 I mean, this is human experience, it's complicated.

1:04:34.220 --> 1:04:37.580
 Yes, all human things are complicated.

1:04:37.580 --> 1:04:41.700
 And I think there's a difference between being reckless

1:04:41.700 --> 1:04:44.980
 and making well thought out informed decisions.

1:04:44.980 --> 1:04:46.340
 If you're going to go all in,

1:04:46.340 --> 1:04:50.900
 make sure you've measured twice, cut once, as they say.

1:04:50.900 --> 1:04:54.980
 And one of my other favorite, I forget,

1:04:54.980 --> 1:04:57.460
 many years ago, I heard this saying and it stayed with me.

1:04:57.460 --> 1:05:00.740
 It was never mistake, clear line of sight

1:05:00.740 --> 1:05:03.820
 with distance and you know that.

1:05:03.820 --> 1:05:08.820
 So I think that the key, whether you're starting a business

1:05:10.020 --> 1:05:12.300
 or you're thinking about leaving the company you're at

1:05:12.300 --> 1:05:15.320
 and starting a business or just leaving for another job,

1:05:15.320 --> 1:05:19.180
 any of these things is as much as you can, right?

1:05:19.180 --> 1:05:21.300
 And psychologists, I think would tell us,

1:05:21.300 --> 1:05:24.300
 it's hard to be self aware completely, right?

1:05:24.300 --> 1:05:27.540
 That's the rub that if we were all completely self aware

1:05:27.540 --> 1:05:30.340
 of everything that we did and strengthen weaknesses,

1:05:30.340 --> 1:05:32.340
 it'd be a different world.

1:05:32.340 --> 1:05:35.480
 But I do think you can work on that

1:05:35.480 --> 1:05:39.380
 and at least challenge yourself to think about it

1:05:39.380 --> 1:05:43.940
 and not be in a position where I'm going to medical school

1:05:43.940 --> 1:05:45.620
 because that's what you do in my family

1:05:45.620 --> 1:05:48.440
 and even though I'm miserable doing it,

1:05:50.100 --> 1:05:51.660
 things like that.

1:05:51.660 --> 1:05:54.700
 So definitely you don't want to be sort of,

1:05:54.700 --> 1:05:59.700
 because you don't think fall victim to conformity.

1:05:59.700 --> 1:06:02.240
 Let's just go on doing the same thing over and over.

1:06:02.240 --> 1:06:03.080
 That's right.

1:06:03.080 --> 1:06:08.080
 But at the same time, is measure twice and cut once.

1:06:11.520 --> 1:06:16.520
 It does feel like some of the biggest leaps taken

1:06:17.120 --> 1:06:21.340
 are where you cut once and measure later.

1:06:22.680 --> 1:06:24.200
 Is you leap in first.

1:06:24.200 --> 1:06:25.040
 Sure.

1:06:25.040 --> 1:06:28.360
 It's almost like a gut, I suppose that is a measurement,

1:06:28.360 --> 1:06:32.320
 but you build up a good gut instinct of what to do

1:06:32.320 --> 1:06:35.040
 and then you just do it and then you figure out,

1:06:35.040 --> 1:06:37.920
 it's the building the airplane as you're flying it.

1:06:37.920 --> 1:06:39.040
 Right.

1:06:39.040 --> 1:06:42.880
 Well, and I think each one of those instances

1:06:42.880 --> 1:06:44.040
 that you could probably cite

1:06:44.040 --> 1:06:47.760
 has its own unique circumstances, right?

1:06:47.760 --> 1:06:50.360
 I don't have a deep biotech background,

1:06:50.360 --> 1:06:51.920
 so if I suddenly stood up and said,

1:06:51.920 --> 1:06:55.080
 I'm gonna put everything I have into this idea,

1:06:55.080 --> 1:06:59.840
 well, those are, it's game theory, right?

1:06:59.840 --> 1:07:01.880
 What are the odds of success?

1:07:01.880 --> 1:07:06.800
 If on the other hand, you're brilliant in your field

1:07:06.800 --> 1:07:08.760
 or you've seen some opportunity

1:07:08.760 --> 1:07:12.040
 that you think is wide open

1:07:12.040 --> 1:07:16.120
 and you're gonna go for it and break stuff, that's great.

1:07:16.120 --> 1:07:20.120
 You just wanna, to me, always say like,

1:07:20.120 --> 1:07:23.700
 how crazy is this on the spectrum of,

1:07:23.700 --> 1:07:25.840
 do I have any expertise?

1:07:25.840 --> 1:07:29.280
 What is the downside if I fail, right?

1:07:30.440 --> 1:07:34.980
 If you're at a certain point in life with young children

1:07:34.980 --> 1:07:37.780
 and you've got a mortgage and whatever else,

1:07:37.780 --> 1:07:41.320
 that is one circumstance versus I just got out of Stanford

1:07:41.320 --> 1:07:44.800
 or I just got out of whatever and I'm gonna go for it.

1:07:44.800 --> 1:07:47.540
 It's just the whole thing, right?

1:07:47.540 --> 1:07:49.920
 It is complex as you point out.

1:07:49.920 --> 1:07:52.820
 And sometimes you just wanna have the right matrix

1:07:52.820 --> 1:07:55.480
 in your head of decision making process

1:07:55.480 --> 1:07:57.680
 to try to arrive at the right place.

1:07:57.680 --> 1:08:00.720
 And even if you get close, that's where I think you say,

1:08:00.720 --> 1:08:03.560
 you know what, the hell with it, I'm doing this.

1:08:03.560 --> 1:08:06.120
 Yeah, yeah.

1:08:06.120 --> 1:08:10.600
 I do wanna ask you about one specific idea

1:08:10.600 --> 1:08:12.600
 that sounds super fascinating

1:08:12.600 --> 1:08:13.880
 that you're involved with recently.

1:08:13.880 --> 1:08:16.240
 You led the $50 million seed round

1:08:16.240 --> 1:08:18.320
 for a company called Colossal

1:08:18.320 --> 1:08:22.920
 that is focused on deextinction.

1:08:22.920 --> 1:08:25.520
 This is funny relative to our connection

1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:27.480
 and conversation about Jurassic World.

1:08:28.520 --> 1:08:30.920
 They're seeking to restore lost ecosystems

1:08:30.920 --> 1:08:34.640
 and use gene editing to restore the woolly mammoth

1:08:34.640 --> 1:08:36.280
 to the Arctic tundra.

1:08:37.680 --> 1:08:39.640
 How are they gonna do that?

1:08:39.640 --> 1:08:43.360
 Well, I met this fascinating guy at Harvard

1:08:43.360 --> 1:08:48.360
 named George Church five, six years ago,

1:08:48.440 --> 1:08:53.440
 and found him to be incredibly smart, have an imagination.

1:08:56.260 --> 1:08:59.820
 And he partnered up with a guy named Ben Lamb,

1:08:59.820 --> 1:09:01.120
 who's an entrepreneur.

1:09:02.540 --> 1:09:07.540
 And basically the press and to me the imaginative,

1:09:09.960 --> 1:09:12.560
 like you're capturing my imagination by telling me

1:09:12.560 --> 1:09:14.000
 you're gonna bring back the woolly mammoth

1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:15.620
 and other extinct animals.

1:09:15.620 --> 1:09:18.720
 And I, you know, we'll see where that road leads.

1:09:18.720 --> 1:09:22.240
 I was more interested in an investor

1:09:22.240 --> 1:09:24.480
 in the things that they're working through

1:09:25.640 --> 1:09:30.080
 around understanding genes and proteins

1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:31.840
 and CRISPR and all these other things

1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:36.840
 because being adjacent to George Church and his team

1:09:36.920 --> 1:09:39.040
 as these things unfold over the next decade,

1:09:39.040 --> 1:09:42.840
 I thought was the right thing to do.

1:09:42.840 --> 1:09:44.160
 So people are important here,

1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:46.600
 just like investing people and seeing

1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:48.120
 what the hell they come up with.

1:09:48.120 --> 1:09:51.420
 Absolutely, I mean, you can look through history

1:09:51.420 --> 1:09:56.420
 and great things are done by great people, right?

1:09:57.360 --> 1:10:02.360
 And companies, they end up over time becoming a logo

1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:04.820
 and immediately what you think of them,

1:10:04.820 --> 1:10:08.360
 but they started out with a person, with an idea

1:10:08.360 --> 1:10:12.340
 and a team that cultivated that and made that happen.

1:10:13.760 --> 1:10:16.560
 And I think there are certain folks

1:10:16.560 --> 1:10:18.240
 that are just immensely talented

1:10:18.240 --> 1:10:21.840
 that if you can be around them,

1:10:21.840 --> 1:10:25.940
 and I also know his and his team's ethics

1:10:25.940 --> 1:10:28.680
 in terms of, you know, after spending time

1:10:28.680 --> 1:10:31.380
 talking about where the lines are,

1:10:32.960 --> 1:10:35.060
 people in other countries that, you know,

1:10:35.060 --> 1:10:37.480
 may not have the same process,

1:10:37.480 --> 1:10:39.760
 may not have the same checks and balances,

1:10:39.760 --> 1:10:42.520
 are doing this and pursuing this regardless.

1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:46.280
 So at least I felt like with George and Ben and their teams,

1:10:46.280 --> 1:10:48.280
 they're also very responsible people.

1:10:49.480 --> 1:10:53.560
 This is where the human side of things comes into play.

1:10:53.560 --> 1:10:55.940
 I've interacted with a lot of really brilliant people

1:10:55.940 --> 1:10:59.760
 in the technology space where you kind of,

1:10:59.760 --> 1:11:01.540
 you know, there's a lot of ways to feel this out.

1:11:01.540 --> 1:11:03.880
 You can ask them whether they kind of read literature.

1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:08.000
 You can feel out how much do they really understand

1:11:08.960 --> 1:11:12.240
 about like human nature here.

1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:14.760
 Like whatever the technology is,

1:11:14.760 --> 1:11:17.800
 when it actually starts to play,

1:11:17.800 --> 1:11:21.120
 interact with society at scale,

1:11:21.120 --> 1:11:23.600
 like do they have an understanding

1:11:23.600 --> 1:11:26.380
 or an intuition about how that happens?

1:11:26.380 --> 1:11:28.160
 Some of that requires studying history.

1:11:28.160 --> 1:11:30.720
 Some of that requires like just looking at

1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:35.320
 the worst and best parts and events in human history

1:11:35.320 --> 1:11:38.800
 to understand like, hey, it doesn't always turn out

1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:42.920
 like everybody hoped the technology turns out.

1:11:43.920 --> 1:11:47.360
 If a person has a depth of understanding about history,

1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:52.320
 about human nature, then I think that's the right person

1:11:52.320 --> 1:11:56.520
 to mess with some of this cutting edge stuff.

1:11:56.520 --> 1:12:01.440
 Now you want Marcus Aurelius with a PhD from MIT.

1:12:01.440 --> 1:12:03.280
 Exactly, exactly.

1:12:04.480 --> 1:12:08.480
 Just small tangent, but you mentioned having a conversation

1:12:08.480 --> 1:12:11.400
 with Warren Buffett, you spoke really highly of him

1:12:11.400 --> 1:12:13.520
 as an investor, as a human being.

1:12:15.520 --> 1:12:17.040
 What about him do you admire?

1:12:17.040 --> 1:12:21.160
 What from him, what insights have you drawn from him

1:12:21.160 --> 1:12:23.720
 as a great investor yourself?

1:12:23.720 --> 1:12:26.220
 Well, the afternoon that I got to spend with him,

1:12:26.220 --> 1:12:28.920
 which is something I'll treasure forever.

1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:31.280
 Look, sometimes when you meet people,

1:12:31.280 --> 1:12:33.360
 even that are immensely successful,

1:12:34.400 --> 1:12:39.360
 you may decide that after 20 minutes or a half hour,

1:12:39.360 --> 1:12:42.320
 oh, you were in the right place at the right time

1:12:42.320 --> 1:12:45.740
 and that's fine.

1:12:45.740 --> 1:12:49.080
 There are other people that are clearly different,

1:12:49.080 --> 1:12:52.940
 special, and I don't care if you made them start from zero,

1:12:52.940 --> 1:12:56.940
 you know, would end up in a good place.

1:12:56.940 --> 1:12:59.560
 And so it was an absolute privilege

1:12:59.560 --> 1:13:00.980
 to spend the time with him.

1:13:03.420 --> 1:13:06.060
 You know, and a couple of things that stood out

1:13:06.060 --> 1:13:11.060
 in the conversation, he is incredibly intellectually curious

1:13:11.340 --> 1:13:15.800
 and well read, and I like how simplistic he likes

1:13:15.800 --> 1:13:17.960
 to keep his thought matrix.

1:13:17.960 --> 1:13:22.960
 And then also, instead of trying to outsmart the market,

1:13:23.320 --> 1:13:26.680
 it seems like a simple axiom, but just look,

1:13:26.680 --> 1:13:30.100
 good companies that are led by talented managers

1:13:31.180 --> 1:13:35.100
 that are good businesses over time are gonna get there.

1:13:35.100 --> 1:13:37.820
 So I'm not gonna day trade, I'm just gonna,

1:13:37.820 --> 1:13:40.380
 I'm looking for value.

1:13:40.380 --> 1:13:44.860
 And then just on life stuff, he just, you know,

1:13:44.860 --> 1:13:49.000
 and also his ability to take in

1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:54.000
 and then use information was incredibly impressive.

1:13:54.660 --> 1:13:58.260
 So I only spent the, you know, I'd met him before,

1:13:58.260 --> 1:14:00.180
 but I only spent one afternoon with him,

1:14:00.180 --> 1:14:02.700
 but it's, you know, pretty incredible.

1:14:02.700 --> 1:14:05.140
 And one of the things that stuck out to me

1:14:05.140 --> 1:14:08.500
 is we were in the middle of talking about Tolko

1:14:08.500 --> 1:14:10.800
 or investing or how we thought about it.

1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:14.540
 And I said, you know, I'm trying to be smart about,

1:14:14.540 --> 1:14:16.740
 and he stopped me and he said, Charlie Munger,

1:14:16.740 --> 1:14:18.540
 his partner of many years, Charlie and I

1:14:18.540 --> 1:14:21.000
 don't try to think of the smart thing to do.

1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:24.640
 We try to think what's the dumb thing we could do here.

1:14:24.640 --> 1:14:28.040
 And I kind of laughed and he said, no, I'm dead serious.

1:14:28.040 --> 1:14:30.860
 We think about it from the standpoint of

1:14:31.900 --> 1:14:34.180
 what could we do in this situation that later

1:14:34.180 --> 1:14:37.480
 we'd be like, that was a really dumb thing to do.

1:14:37.480 --> 1:14:41.420
 And I actually thought that was, it got in my head.

1:14:41.420 --> 1:14:43.460
 And I still think a lot about that

1:14:43.460 --> 1:14:45.680
 as I'm dissecting problems.

1:14:46.860 --> 1:14:51.540
 So there is, like, that's a kind of longterm thinking

1:14:51.540 --> 1:14:54.100
 if you just avoid the dumb things,

1:14:54.100 --> 1:14:59.100
 or if you simplify, just focus on those simple steps,

1:14:59.340 --> 1:15:02.740
 all it takes is just do that for a long period of time

1:15:02.740 --> 1:15:04.500
 and you'll be successful.

1:15:04.500 --> 1:15:07.580
 Well, it certainly worked for him, that's all I can say.

1:15:07.580 --> 1:15:10.220
 What about you?

1:15:10.220 --> 1:15:14.660
 You've been a great investor yourself.

1:15:14.660 --> 1:15:18.240
 How do you know, when you judge people,

1:15:18.240 --> 1:15:21.140
 so I, whenever I go to San Francisco,

1:15:21.140 --> 1:15:22.900
 I was thinking of moving to San Francisco.

1:15:22.900 --> 1:15:26.020
 That's why I decided to, after really giving it

1:15:26.020 --> 1:15:29.020
 some thought, talking to people, decided to move to Austin.

1:15:29.020 --> 1:15:33.660
 You know, everybody's dreaming big and they have big plans.

1:15:33.660 --> 1:15:37.780
 And it's actually, I don't envy the job of an investor

1:15:37.780 --> 1:15:42.180
 of any kind, because everybody has big dreams

1:15:42.180 --> 1:15:45.140
 and it's hard to know who exactly,

1:15:45.140 --> 1:15:48.380
 what idea is going to materialize,

1:15:48.380 --> 1:15:51.700
 what team is going to materialize into something great.

1:15:51.700 --> 1:15:55.140
 How do you make those decisions about people, about ideas?

1:15:57.340 --> 1:16:01.900
 Well, if I had any kind of a lattice work on this,

1:16:01.900 --> 1:16:04.860
 it absolutely starts with the people.

1:16:04.860 --> 1:16:08.300
 And I think the reason for that is your business plan

1:16:08.300 --> 1:16:10.340
 is going to change, right?

1:16:10.340 --> 1:16:13.340
 There's very few businesses I know of that say,

1:16:13.340 --> 1:16:16.020
 we're gonna make a widget in this location

1:16:16.020 --> 1:16:18.460
 and 30 years later, we're successful

1:16:18.460 --> 1:16:21.060
 and we just make a widget and that's what it is.

1:16:21.060 --> 1:16:22.420
 Things happen, right?

1:16:22.420 --> 1:16:24.980
 And today they happen with such velocity

1:16:25.980 --> 1:16:30.980
 that you have to be able to make hard decisions

1:16:31.340 --> 1:16:34.220
 based on imperfect information.

1:16:34.220 --> 1:16:38.700
 And are you, how are you going to calculate those answers?

1:16:38.700 --> 1:16:41.780
 How self interested are you going to be?

1:16:41.780 --> 1:16:43.940
 What kind of ethics will you apply?

1:16:44.900 --> 1:16:47.500
 What's your short term versus long term thinking?

1:16:47.500 --> 1:16:52.140
 Are you able to give an honest assessment of a situation?

1:16:53.380 --> 1:16:55.820
 Because the thing that you can count on

1:16:55.820 --> 1:16:58.460
 is problems are gonna happen.

1:16:58.460 --> 1:17:01.620
 Things you didn't anticipate are gonna happen.

1:17:01.620 --> 1:17:04.020
 How pliable are you, right?

1:17:04.020 --> 1:17:09.020
 How much elasticity is there in your ability

1:17:09.060 --> 1:17:10.620
 to be successful?

1:17:10.620 --> 1:17:15.220
 And I think it's important when you invest in something

1:17:15.220 --> 1:17:20.020
 that you both see, you understand the roadmap ahead

1:17:20.020 --> 1:17:21.740
 and agree to it, right?

1:17:21.740 --> 1:17:23.460
 Doesn't mean there won't be twists and turns,

1:17:23.460 --> 1:17:25.060
 but you're not like, whoa, wait a minute,

1:17:25.060 --> 1:17:26.260
 what did we do here?

1:17:26.260 --> 1:17:29.540
 This isn't what was in the thing I signed up for.

1:17:29.540 --> 1:17:34.540
 And then I think honesty and communication

1:17:34.940 --> 1:17:36.700
 is a huge thing to me with,

1:17:38.260 --> 1:17:42.340
 I always tell people if bi directionally,

1:17:42.340 --> 1:17:43.780
 if there's something going on,

1:17:43.780 --> 1:17:48.380
 start the conversation with, Lex, we have a problem.

1:17:48.380 --> 1:17:52.180
 Okay, now I'm sitting up, you have my full attention,

1:17:52.180 --> 1:17:54.180
 we're gonna talk about whatever it is.

1:17:54.180 --> 1:17:56.840
 Bad news should travel faster than good news.

1:17:56.840 --> 1:18:01.320
 And because it's going to happen,

1:18:02.240 --> 1:18:04.480
 being in business with someone

1:18:04.480 --> 1:18:06.080
 that is gonna shoot you straight

1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:09.880
 and sometimes say, I don't know.

1:18:09.880 --> 1:18:10.920
 I don't know what the answer is.

1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:12.520
 I gotta go figure it out.

1:18:12.520 --> 1:18:15.880
 That I can process a lot better than,

1:18:15.880 --> 1:18:18.440
 look, I don't want you mad at me or disappointed

1:18:18.440 --> 1:18:20.920
 or I can't handle not having success.

1:18:20.920 --> 1:18:23.040
 So we're just gonna kick the can.

1:18:23.040 --> 1:18:26.960
 And I think, especially in today's business environment,

1:18:26.960 --> 1:18:29.840
 that's very, very dangerous.

1:18:29.840 --> 1:18:33.040
 So that's a bad sign, not just because it's good

1:18:33.040 --> 1:18:35.760
 to communicate and be honest,

1:18:35.760 --> 1:18:37.800
 but if they're not willing to do that,

1:18:37.800 --> 1:18:40.280
 then it goes back to the intellectual honesty.

1:18:40.280 --> 1:18:44.760
 They're probably not also able to be brutally honest

1:18:44.760 --> 1:18:46.400
 with themselves when they look in the mirror

1:18:46.400 --> 1:18:48.400
 about the direction of the company.

1:18:48.400 --> 1:18:53.260
 But look, I wasn't there, so I don't know.

1:18:53.260 --> 1:18:57.800
 But I think if you unpack many situations

1:18:57.800 --> 1:19:00.040
 that turned out negatively,

1:19:00.040 --> 1:19:03.720
 most of the people, whether you're faking lab results,

1:19:03.720 --> 1:19:05.600
 you have a biotech company,

1:19:05.600 --> 1:19:08.440
 everybody's staring at Theranos these days.

1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:13.200
 Do I think in a lot of cases, you're either the villain,

1:19:13.200 --> 1:19:14.880
 like you started out saying,

1:19:14.880 --> 1:19:17.120
 I'm gonna screw my shareholders over

1:19:17.120 --> 1:19:22.120
 and I'm gonna be a liar, that isn't my experience.

1:19:22.760 --> 1:19:25.960
 Most things are little incremental moves that you say,

1:19:25.960 --> 1:19:27.500
 we're gonna get this right next week,

1:19:27.500 --> 1:19:29.160
 but today we gotta make the presentation.

1:19:29.160 --> 1:19:31.680
 So we're gonna just tweak things a little bit.

1:19:31.680 --> 1:19:34.160
 That's a slippery slope, right?

1:19:34.160 --> 1:19:38.620
 And so that's why I think from a standpoint of people,

1:19:39.640 --> 1:19:43.000
 you wanna go into the foxhole with folks that,

1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:47.480
 you know, understand things are gonna happen

1:19:47.480 --> 1:19:49.000
 and I'm gonna let you know about them

1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:52.960
 and we're gonna try to solve them together.

1:19:52.960 --> 1:19:55.320
 And then just in terms of the idea,

1:19:55.320 --> 1:19:57.720
 it's, I always ask like, okay,

1:19:57.720 --> 1:20:00.360
 if this company executed the way,

1:20:00.360 --> 1:20:01.840
 that's the other thing that always cracks me up

1:20:01.840 --> 1:20:05.000
 about financials, whenever somebody pitches you,

1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:06.160
 inevitably they'll say,

1:20:06.160 --> 1:20:09.920
 our projections are really, really conservative.

1:20:09.920 --> 1:20:11.820
 I'm still waiting for somebody to come in and say,

1:20:11.820 --> 1:20:14.440
 look, my projections are wildly optimistic.

1:20:14.440 --> 1:20:17.200
 We'll never hit these numbers, but anyway,

1:20:18.760 --> 1:20:22.600
 it's, you know, if this company did what it says

1:20:22.600 --> 1:20:25.700
 and executes and does it matter, right?

1:20:25.700 --> 1:20:27.240
 Does it move the needle enough?

1:20:27.240 --> 1:20:31.400
 And what are the things that uniquely position

1:20:31.400 --> 1:20:33.200
 this company to be successful?

1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:35.080
 And you just have to be able to answer,

1:20:35.080 --> 1:20:39.080
 I think a number of those questions pretty crisply.

1:20:39.080 --> 1:20:41.640
 But at the end of the day, it's still a big risk.

1:20:41.640 --> 1:20:44.500
 So you're just trying to minimize the risk.

1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:49.200
 Let me jump to another topic.

1:20:50.260 --> 1:20:53.000
 You're an incredible human being

1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:54.320
 that you're involved with this.

1:20:54.320 --> 1:20:59.320
 Your band, Ghost Hounds, is touring with the Rolling Stones.

1:21:00.360 --> 1:21:03.400
 So before we talk about your band, let me ask about that.

1:21:03.400 --> 1:21:07.100
 What's that like, playing with the Rolling Stones?

1:21:07.100 --> 1:21:12.100
 Surreal, just because they're my favorite band of all time.

1:21:15.480 --> 1:21:17.280
 To me, the greatest rock and roll band,

1:21:17.280 --> 1:21:19.040
 it's not even close, of all time.

1:21:19.040 --> 1:21:22.520
 And, you know, to share the same stage,

1:21:22.520 --> 1:21:25.720
 to be on tour and to go out

1:21:25.720 --> 1:21:30.400
 and get that energy from the crowd, you know,

1:21:30.400 --> 1:21:32.360
 and every night and come off stage

1:21:32.360 --> 1:21:34.700
 and later when they go on and you hear that iconic,

1:21:34.700 --> 1:21:36.680
 ladies and gentlemen, the Rolling Stones.

1:21:36.680 --> 1:21:38.560
 And then it's incredible.

1:21:38.560 --> 1:21:42.440
 And, you know, what's amazing to me about the band,

1:21:42.440 --> 1:21:47.220
 next year will be their 60th anniversary, 60 years.

1:21:48.080 --> 1:21:53.080
 And it's hard to be around anything for that long,

1:21:53.080 --> 1:21:56.560
 but making music and packing stadiums.

1:21:56.560 --> 1:21:59.720
 And what's amazing to me, they can play a two hour set

1:21:59.720 --> 1:22:03.080
 and it's not just that, oh, that's a hit or you recognize it.

1:22:03.080 --> 1:22:06.120
 It's like every song is an anthem, right?

1:22:06.120 --> 1:22:10.840
 And so it's been amazing.

1:22:10.840 --> 1:22:12.800
 We got to play with them in 2019.

1:22:12.800 --> 1:22:15.720
 And when they ask us to do this again,

1:22:17.160 --> 1:22:19.880
 it's just an absolute privilege.

1:22:19.880 --> 1:22:21.640
 I asked you this offline,

1:22:21.640 --> 1:22:24.800
 so I know you are a kind of rockstar,

1:22:24.800 --> 1:22:27.640
 but just me, maybe I'm projecting,

1:22:27.640 --> 1:22:31.880
 but do you get nervous, such a large audience

1:22:31.880 --> 1:22:33.800
 with the Rolling Stones?

1:22:33.800 --> 1:22:36.080
 It feels like there'll be a lot of pressure.

1:22:36.080 --> 1:22:39.520
 Yeah, I mean, you definitely don't want to screw it up.

1:22:39.520 --> 1:22:44.520
 I think our band is tight knit and all that stuff.

1:22:45.680 --> 1:22:50.680
 And I think that the individual nervousness dissipates

1:22:50.720 --> 1:22:54.400
 when you go out as a group and you're making music together

1:22:54.400 --> 1:22:57.240
 and you sort of, okay, we're all in this

1:22:57.240 --> 1:23:01.680
 and we're doing a thing, which is why even in sports,

1:23:01.680 --> 1:23:04.760
 I always look at individual events like ice skating

1:23:04.760 --> 1:23:09.040
 or anything where it's just you out there alone.

1:23:09.040 --> 1:23:12.960
 And that's different than being with a team and nerve wracking.

1:23:12.960 --> 1:23:16.880
 So I'm sure if it was me with an acoustic guitar

1:23:16.880 --> 1:23:18.920
 just going out, it would feel different,

1:23:18.920 --> 1:23:22.720
 but absolutely you get the right kind of butterflies,

1:23:22.720 --> 1:23:23.600
 I would call it.

1:23:24.960 --> 1:23:28.040
 And just the energy of playing music

1:23:28.040 --> 1:23:33.040
 and having it be this relationship and look, I get it.

1:23:33.040 --> 1:23:36.040
 I've been to a ton of concerts where I'm like,

1:23:36.040 --> 1:23:38.640
 look, can we just get to the band please?

1:23:38.640 --> 1:23:42.440
 But what's been great is just an amazing reception.

1:23:43.840 --> 1:23:46.480
 And we have this guy named Trey Nation

1:23:46.480 --> 1:23:49.960
 who's the lead singer who's just incredibly talented.

1:23:49.960 --> 1:23:54.200
 I mean, he's just not only an amazing voice,

1:23:54.200 --> 1:23:56.520
 but just has that charismatic thing.

1:23:56.520 --> 1:23:57.920
 Yeah, he's great.

1:23:57.920 --> 1:23:58.760
 It's fun.

1:23:58.760 --> 1:24:02.800
 What's it feel like to play in front of a huge audience?

1:24:02.800 --> 1:24:07.400
 What's, as a guitarist, are you lost in the music?

1:24:07.400 --> 1:24:10.600
 Like you almost don't feel the audience.

1:24:10.600 --> 1:24:12.320
 Does it add extra energy?

1:24:12.320 --> 1:24:14.360
 Does it add extra anxiety?

1:24:14.360 --> 1:24:17.320
 What does it feel like?

1:24:17.320 --> 1:24:19.480
 You know, stadiums are interesting

1:24:19.480 --> 1:24:22.380
 just because it's so big and cavernous.

1:24:22.380 --> 1:24:24.600
 And because you want to protect your ears.

1:24:24.600 --> 1:24:27.240
 So we use an in ear system

1:24:27.240 --> 1:24:30.600
 so that you are a little disconnected from the crowd.

1:24:30.600 --> 1:24:32.180
 Because if you're playing that loud

1:24:32.180 --> 1:24:33.400
 and you're standing in front of your amps

1:24:33.400 --> 1:24:36.440
 without ear protection, that's bad.

1:24:36.440 --> 1:24:38.200
 How are you monitoring the sound?

1:24:38.200 --> 1:24:40.520
 The in ear stuff, is that producing sound

1:24:40.520 --> 1:24:41.920
 or is it strictly ear plugs?

1:24:41.920 --> 1:24:43.160
 No, it's producing the sound.

1:24:43.160 --> 1:24:47.520
 So it's like putting ear pods in and listening to a song

1:24:47.520 --> 1:24:48.840
 and you're playing to it, right?

1:24:48.840 --> 1:24:51.440
 It's just us playing, but it protects your ears.

1:24:54.800 --> 1:24:58.000
 But the energy from the crowd,

1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:00.640
 when they get going and get into it,

1:25:00.640 --> 1:25:03.380
 which Knock On Wood so far has been amazing,

1:25:04.640 --> 1:25:06.440
 there's nothing like it.

1:25:06.440 --> 1:25:11.440
 I mean, it's just this bi directional thing that happens.

1:25:12.080 --> 1:25:17.080
 And music and sports were kind of my first loves.

1:25:18.680 --> 1:25:23.680
 And yeah, it's very difficult to describe,

1:25:23.680 --> 1:25:28.680
 I think accurately, because it's like no other feeling.

1:25:31.260 --> 1:25:35.500
 Musically, how is it different than playing in a garage

1:25:35.500 --> 1:25:38.260
 with the band by yourself practicing?

1:25:38.260 --> 1:25:42.500
 Like, do you feel like you're creating something different

1:25:42.500 --> 1:25:47.500
 when you got the guitar and the amp

1:25:47.860 --> 1:25:50.180
 and just the sound dissipating out

1:25:50.180 --> 1:25:52.840
 and everybody's listening, is that?

1:25:52.840 --> 1:25:55.660
 It's, listen, the first time we did it

1:25:55.660 --> 1:25:57.140
 and there's nobody in the stadium,

1:25:57.140 --> 1:25:59.220
 first time I ever played in the stadium.

1:25:59.220 --> 1:26:03.300
 And I'm just like, I'm out there in front

1:26:03.300 --> 1:26:05.340
 and just hitting different chords

1:26:05.340 --> 1:26:06.440
 and playing different licks.

1:26:06.440 --> 1:26:09.220
 And I'm like, it's like I won a contest

1:26:09.220 --> 1:26:10.460
 and I get to do this.

1:26:11.820 --> 1:26:15.040
 But what's different about it,

1:26:15.040 --> 1:26:16.300
 and each venue is different.

1:26:16.300 --> 1:26:21.300
 So if you, we went on the road with ZZ Top a few years ago,

1:26:21.300 --> 1:26:22.580
 which was incredible.

1:26:22.580 --> 1:26:24.400
 Love Billy Gibbons, he's a Texan.

1:26:25.660 --> 1:26:28.100
 Incredible person and guitar player.

1:26:28.100 --> 1:26:32.520
 But when you're playing in like five to 7,000 seats,

1:26:32.520 --> 1:26:36.420
 it's really, I mean, it's, you're right there with them,

1:26:36.420 --> 1:26:37.340
 with the crowd.

1:26:37.340 --> 1:26:39.780
 And then when you play in an arena,

1:26:40.900 --> 1:26:44.980
 we toured with Bob Seger on his last tour, which was cool.

1:26:44.980 --> 1:26:47.100
 Played some shows with him.

1:26:47.100 --> 1:26:50.220
 And again, the arena, like they're all kind of packed

1:26:50.220 --> 1:26:51.820
 on top of you.

1:26:51.820 --> 1:26:54.240
 And it's super loud, which was cool.

1:26:55.460 --> 1:26:56.620
 Meaning the crowd is,

1:26:56.620 --> 1:26:59.940
 stadiums is a completely different animal.

1:26:59.940 --> 1:27:04.940
 And it's just a completely different experience.

1:27:05.400 --> 1:27:08.380
 Do you enjoy it versus like a smaller room?

1:27:09.380 --> 1:27:13.380
 What, as a guitarist, as a musician,

1:27:13.380 --> 1:27:16.420
 what's your favorite like room to play of the size?

1:27:16.420 --> 1:27:17.860
 Any room that'll have me.

1:27:17.860 --> 1:27:22.860
 You know, look, I think arenas are the perfect blend.

1:27:23.720 --> 1:27:26.560
 If I had to say, because it's loud and, you know,

1:27:26.560 --> 1:27:31.120
 20, 30,000 people, but like right up, right up on you.

1:27:31.120 --> 1:27:36.120
 A stadium, look, playing the stadiums with the Rolling

1:27:36.680 --> 1:27:40.120
 Stones, it just is gonna go on the head marker somewhere

1:27:40.120 --> 1:27:42.680
 is one of the more, you know, I say this,

1:27:42.680 --> 1:27:43.680
 and I really mean it.

1:27:43.680 --> 1:27:47.160
 My life is like a punked episode that just hasn't,

1:27:47.160 --> 1:27:51.560
 no one's burst in yet, but yeah,

1:27:51.560 --> 1:27:53.300
 it's as cool as you think it is.

1:27:53.300 --> 1:27:56.340
 So 60 years, how do you think Mick Jagger still got it?

1:27:58.560 --> 1:27:59.560
 How do you explain it?

1:27:59.560 --> 1:28:00.520
 I gotta tell you something.

1:28:00.520 --> 1:28:04.760
 I mean, the funny thing is whatever,

1:28:04.760 --> 1:28:06.440
 wherever there is excellence,

1:28:06.440 --> 1:28:09.680
 people wanna know how'd you do it, right?

1:28:09.680 --> 1:28:10.900
 What's the secret?

1:28:12.240 --> 1:28:15.200
 Not only is Mick Jagger, and I think the songs

1:28:15.200 --> 1:28:17.960
 that Keith Richards and Mick Jagger wrote together,

1:28:17.960 --> 1:28:19.960
 if you go back and listen to the lyrics,

1:28:21.440 --> 1:28:23.920
 it's just incredibly poignant,

1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:27.360
 and I'm just a huge Stones fan, so,

1:28:27.360 --> 1:28:32.360
 but he works out like a maniac, right?

1:28:32.400 --> 1:28:35.540
 And it's that 10,000 hours thing,

1:28:35.540 --> 1:28:38.560
 and it's that, hey, maybe I don't feel my best today,

1:28:38.560 --> 1:28:41.920
 but I'm gonna get up and do my routine and work out

1:28:41.920 --> 1:28:46.920
 so that at his age, which, I mean,

1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:51.000
 you can look at people at different ages chronologically

1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:54.320
 that are, maybe we're both at this age,

1:28:54.320 --> 1:28:57.820
 but I'm a lot older than you are, and vice versa.

1:28:57.820 --> 1:29:02.820
 And he just, I think it's the combination of raw talent

1:29:02.840 --> 1:29:06.040
 and the ability, and he's very smart, right?

1:29:06.040 --> 1:29:10.480
 Like he understands how to have interaction with a crowd

1:29:10.480 --> 1:29:11.960
 and hold them in the palm of his hand

1:29:11.960 --> 1:29:15.120
 and be an entertainer, but then on top of that,

1:29:15.120 --> 1:29:19.080
 the reason he can at this age run around stadiums

1:29:19.080 --> 1:29:22.680
 and be just as energetic is he puts the work in.

1:29:22.680 --> 1:29:24.640
 And that's one thing, step that I think

1:29:24.640 --> 1:29:26.580
 a lot of people miss sometimes,

1:29:26.580 --> 1:29:28.000
 where they want that magic trick,

1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:30.280
 they wanna know what's the shortcut.

1:29:30.280 --> 1:29:32.800
 Most of the time, the answer is there's no shortcut.

1:29:32.800 --> 1:29:36.200
 Yeah, you have to work hard on the way there

1:29:36.200 --> 1:29:38.060
 and work hard to stay on top.

1:29:39.200 --> 1:29:40.040
 That's it.

1:29:40.040 --> 1:29:41.840
 And sometimes it's not even like work hard,

1:29:41.840 --> 1:29:45.200
 it's just like be a professional,

1:29:45.200 --> 1:29:49.000
 which that involves, in his case, at his age,

1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:51.720
 with the amount of stuff you have to do on stage

1:29:51.720 --> 1:29:53.080
 and the way he does it.

1:29:53.080 --> 1:29:53.920
 For two hours.

1:29:53.920 --> 1:29:58.240
 You have, this is a professional athlete.

1:29:58.240 --> 1:30:01.560
 A professional athlete that has to do things

1:30:01.560 --> 1:30:04.240
 that are probably designed for 20 year olds

1:30:04.240 --> 1:30:06.880
 and 30 year olds has to do it at an older age,

1:30:06.880 --> 1:30:08.720
 which means what do you have to do?

1:30:08.720 --> 1:30:11.320
 Well, he probably has a whole physical routine

1:30:11.320 --> 1:30:12.440
 he has to do.

1:30:12.440 --> 1:30:13.800
 Diet, the whole thing.

1:30:13.800 --> 1:30:17.200
 And it's hard, look, if you wanna do great things,

1:30:17.200 --> 1:30:19.980
 you probably have to do hard things to get there.

1:30:20.960 --> 1:30:22.960
 I'm not gonna make you pick,

1:30:22.960 --> 1:30:25.680
 just stick on the stones for one more minute.

1:30:26.720 --> 1:30:31.720
 But what are some great Rolling Stones songs

1:30:31.800 --> 1:30:36.040
 that were impactful to you, lyrically, musically,

1:30:36.040 --> 1:30:41.040
 maybe something you like playing, like air guitar.

1:30:41.320 --> 1:30:42.320
 Oh, sure.

1:30:42.320 --> 1:30:43.840
 I don't know.

1:30:43.840 --> 1:30:47.080
 Probably my favorites, I love Sympathy for the Devil.

1:30:47.080 --> 1:30:47.920
 Yeah.

1:30:47.920 --> 1:30:51.000
 It's a very, I don't know, sort of Faustian.

1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:52.360
 I love the lyrics.

1:30:52.360 --> 1:30:55.080
 I love how the, almost a voodoo beat

1:30:55.080 --> 1:30:57.300
 just kind of builds throughout the song.

1:30:58.460 --> 1:31:00.320
 That's always been one of my favorites.

1:31:00.320 --> 1:31:02.980
 So in that song, he never mentions Devil, does he?

1:31:02.980 --> 1:31:04.020
 No, wait, sorry.

1:31:04.020 --> 1:31:07.580
 Like, you know my name.

1:31:07.580 --> 1:31:08.420
 Yeah.

1:31:08.420 --> 1:31:11.180
 There's like a flirtation going on in the lyrics.

1:31:11.180 --> 1:31:12.020
 It's kind of interesting.

1:31:12.020 --> 1:31:15.180
 Yeah, here's all the trouble I've caused along the way

1:31:15.180 --> 1:31:16.940
 with you humans.

1:31:16.940 --> 1:31:18.820
 And I just think it's really, really great.

1:31:18.820 --> 1:31:20.700
 And musically, it builds really nicely.

1:31:20.700 --> 1:31:21.540
 Yeah.

1:31:21.540 --> 1:31:23.420
 And it's like both fun and dark.

1:31:23.420 --> 1:31:24.600
 It's cool.

1:31:24.600 --> 1:31:25.440
 It's a,

1:31:29.180 --> 1:31:30.980
 there's a playful nature to it.

1:31:30.980 --> 1:31:33.660
 It's, that's very stones.

1:31:33.660 --> 1:31:34.900
 The only, they can pull it off

1:31:34.900 --> 1:31:36.300
 because it's like playful,

1:31:36.300 --> 1:31:39.860
 but it's also like dark and dangerous, dangerous, dangerous.

1:31:39.860 --> 1:31:40.700
 Yeah.

1:31:40.700 --> 1:31:44.300
 And Gimme Shelter is just, you know,

1:31:44.300 --> 1:31:48.380
 and to this day, when I listen to the studio version

1:31:48.380 --> 1:31:53.380
 and Mary Clayton just comes on and sings that epic,

1:31:53.380 --> 1:31:55.500
 iconic part.

1:31:55.500 --> 1:31:58.820
 And there's a documentary that was done

1:31:58.820 --> 1:32:02.560
 about backup singers, phenomenal.

1:32:02.560 --> 1:32:06.820
 And it tells the story of that moment

1:32:06.820 --> 1:32:08.220
 in that song with Mary Clayton.

1:32:08.220 --> 1:32:13.220
 And it's just her voice and the way it unfolded,

1:32:13.300 --> 1:32:15.740
 they got her out of bed at like 10 o clock at night in LA.

1:32:15.740 --> 1:32:17.820
 And she's like the Rolling Stones,

1:32:17.820 --> 1:32:20.540
 and went in and just killed it.

1:32:20.540 --> 1:32:23.140
 And I can't sing at all.

1:32:23.140 --> 1:32:26.780
 I'm by ordinance not allowed around a microphone.

1:32:26.780 --> 1:32:31.780
 So I'm always in awe when someone can sing like that.

1:32:32.980 --> 1:32:35.260
 But, you know, those are,

1:32:35.260 --> 1:32:39.180
 those are some of my favorite Rolling Stones songs

1:32:39.180 --> 1:32:41.480
 and Painted Black's awesome.

1:32:41.480 --> 1:32:42.660
 I mean, I could go on and on.

1:32:42.660 --> 1:32:44.020
 Yeah, Painted Black is great.

1:32:44.020 --> 1:32:45.980
 Again, a song that builds as bad as,

1:32:45.980 --> 1:32:48.340
 I mean, it defines a whole generation.

1:32:48.340 --> 1:32:49.580
 What made you pick up a guitar?

1:32:49.580 --> 1:32:52.580
 What made you fall in love with the guitar?

1:32:52.580 --> 1:32:55.060
 It's just the coolest instrument, right?

1:32:55.060 --> 1:32:57.640
 I mean, when you watched back then,

1:32:59.220 --> 1:33:01.640
 and I was kind of an old soul.

1:33:01.640 --> 1:33:06.640
 I was listening at a fairly young age to Muddy Waters,

1:33:08.180 --> 1:33:11.860
 Robert Johnson, Lightning Hopkins, BB King,

1:33:11.860 --> 1:33:14.860
 and just the soulfulness.

1:33:14.860 --> 1:33:16.020
 Thrills gone.

1:33:16.020 --> 1:33:21.020
 Oh my, I mean, BB plays five notes and just kills it

1:33:21.820 --> 1:33:24.100
 and the emotion that it evokes.

1:33:24.100 --> 1:33:29.100
 So I just was just in awe of the instrument.

1:33:29.380 --> 1:33:34.380
 And I also, there's always somebody around who's a musician

1:33:36.100 --> 1:33:39.340
 that just picks the instrument up and can play, right?

1:33:39.340 --> 1:33:41.260
 And they're just so talented at it.

1:33:41.260 --> 1:33:43.940
 And they can just listen to a record and play it.

1:33:43.940 --> 1:33:45.780
 That was never me.

1:33:45.780 --> 1:33:47.940
 I never took formal lessons.

1:33:47.940 --> 1:33:52.020
 I had to grind to just make it sound

1:33:52.020 --> 1:33:54.260
 like I wanted it to sound.

1:33:54.260 --> 1:33:58.180
 So both technically and ear, everything was hard work.

1:33:58.180 --> 1:34:02.980
 Yeah, I mean, I could hear it and what they call,

1:34:02.980 --> 1:34:04.380
 you know, you play.

1:34:04.380 --> 1:34:09.380
 So my right hand, the rhythm side of it is,

1:34:09.760 --> 1:34:12.340
 that's probably if I have anything, my strength.

1:34:13.180 --> 1:34:18.100
 But there's something pretty amazing that happens

1:34:18.100 --> 1:34:22.500
 when you get together with other people and play a song

1:34:22.500 --> 1:34:24.860
 in that moment where it hits the pocket

1:34:25.940 --> 1:34:27.940
 and you all kind of know it.

1:34:27.940 --> 1:34:31.140
 And it's just such a cool feeling.

1:34:31.140 --> 1:34:34.940
 And it was interesting growing up because I was,

1:34:34.940 --> 1:34:36.620
 again, I always had eclectic interests.

1:34:36.620 --> 1:34:38.780
 So I loved math and physics and science.

1:34:38.780 --> 1:34:41.100
 So I had those friends and I was an athlete

1:34:41.100 --> 1:34:43.080
 and played football and baseball and basketball.

1:34:43.080 --> 1:34:47.780
 So I had my jock friends, and then I had my music friends

1:34:47.780 --> 1:34:51.620
 and so it was just kind of that.

1:34:51.620 --> 1:34:55.760
 And so when I was still living in Los Angeles

1:34:55.760 --> 1:35:00.760
 and had Legendary, I just missed playing.

1:35:01.620 --> 1:35:04.540
 And so I put this band together

1:35:04.540 --> 1:35:08.160
 and called it the Ghost Hounds because again,

1:35:08.160 --> 1:35:13.060
 huge Robert Johnson fan and that legend of Robert Johnson

1:35:13.060 --> 1:35:15.220
 selling his soul at the crossroads

1:35:15.220 --> 1:35:17.100
 in exchange for his musical talent.

1:35:17.100 --> 1:35:18.820
 And you guys have that in one of the videos.

1:35:18.820 --> 1:35:19.660
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:35:19.660 --> 1:35:20.500
 Such a cool video.

1:35:20.500 --> 1:35:25.500
 Exactly, so I just thought that's such cool lore.

1:35:26.740 --> 1:35:28.340
 I just love the blues.

1:35:28.340 --> 1:35:32.100
 So Robert Johnson would often talk about hellhounds

1:35:32.100 --> 1:35:33.460
 on his trail.

1:35:33.460 --> 1:35:37.580
 And so I always just thought, huh, what about ghost towns?

1:35:37.580 --> 1:35:41.500
 So I wish it were a more clever, deeper story,

1:35:41.500 --> 1:35:43.780
 but that's about it for the name.

1:35:43.780 --> 1:35:45.780
 That's pretty deep, Robert Johnson's incredible.

1:35:45.780 --> 1:35:48.340
 But you also talk about that you connect

1:35:48.340 --> 1:35:50.860
 to the storytelling of blues.

1:35:50.860 --> 1:35:53.740
 So what makes a good story in a song?

1:35:53.740 --> 1:35:57.840
 Like what aspect of storytelling connects with you in song?

1:35:57.840 --> 1:35:59.100
 So I'm a big lyrics guy too.

1:35:59.100 --> 1:36:03.820
 I love like deep lyric people like Tom Waits

1:36:03.820 --> 1:36:07.100
 and like people that are like Leonard Cohen,

1:36:07.100 --> 1:36:12.100
 like even Bob Dylan, they're like obviously, it's poetry.

1:36:12.700 --> 1:36:15.500
 And then there's some people like the Rolling Stones there.

1:36:15.500 --> 1:36:18.220
 It's like seemingly simpler,

1:36:18.220 --> 1:36:20.940
 but it's still so much more to it.

1:36:20.940 --> 1:36:23.700
 It's like less is often more.

1:36:23.700 --> 1:36:25.580
 It still tells a strong story.

1:36:25.580 --> 1:36:27.740
 Yeah, and there's certain people

1:36:27.740 --> 1:36:30.340
 and Jagger and Mick Jagger and Keith Richards

1:36:30.340 --> 1:36:31.180
 are in this boat.

1:36:31.180 --> 1:36:32.860
 Billy Gibbons is in this boat.

1:36:32.860 --> 1:36:35.660
 They just say things in a certain way

1:36:35.660 --> 1:36:37.220
 that are just cool, right?

1:36:37.220 --> 1:36:42.220
 It's just, and so I write our music and lyrics.

1:36:42.220 --> 1:36:44.980
 I have to tell a story.

1:36:44.980 --> 1:36:46.700
 I have to know the characters in the song.

1:36:46.700 --> 1:36:49.460
 I'm not good at just writing some rhymes

1:36:49.460 --> 1:36:52.740
 and having it match up to the right key and the right music.

1:36:52.740 --> 1:36:56.540
 I have to understand like, that's just me.

1:36:56.540 --> 1:36:59.460
 And so I think that, look,

1:36:59.460 --> 1:37:02.340
 if you have three or four minutes to tell a story,

1:37:02.340 --> 1:37:07.340
 you have to be more efficient with your use of language.

1:37:07.340 --> 1:37:10.460
 And you have to understand what you're building to it

1:37:10.460 --> 1:37:12.820
 understand what you're building to, if anything,

1:37:12.820 --> 1:37:15.420
 and evoke emotion.

1:37:15.420 --> 1:37:18.580
 And hopefully for those three minutes,

1:37:18.580 --> 1:37:21.620
 get the listener to understand

1:37:21.620 --> 1:37:22.860
 not only the point of the song,

1:37:22.860 --> 1:37:24.500
 but where you're coming from

1:37:24.500 --> 1:37:28.260
 and to make you feel a certain way.

1:37:28.260 --> 1:37:31.780
 There's a song that the audience has seemed to like a lot

1:37:31.780 --> 1:37:34.340
 on the new album called Good Old Days.

1:37:34.340 --> 1:37:38.380
 And I wrote that because especially during COVID

1:37:38.380 --> 1:37:42.180
 and reflecting on what normalcy looks like

1:37:42.180 --> 1:37:44.500
 and what happens when you're cut off,

1:37:46.220 --> 1:37:49.100
 I just was kind of taken with this idea of

1:37:50.100 --> 1:37:53.660
 that when you sit around and reminisce with friends,

1:37:53.660 --> 1:37:58.660
 oftentimes it's not just like some big event happened.

1:37:59.300 --> 1:38:00.900
 It's, remember that summer,

1:38:00.900 --> 1:38:03.020
 we'd go up to the lake all the time

1:38:03.020 --> 1:38:05.300
 and it's who you were with.

1:38:05.300 --> 1:38:09.540
 And at the time, it probably seemed pretty pedestrian.

1:38:09.540 --> 1:38:12.100
 It just seemed like kind of a normal day,

1:38:12.100 --> 1:38:13.980
 but it was the company you were keeping.

1:38:13.980 --> 1:38:15.740
 It was the time in your life.

1:38:15.740 --> 1:38:17.860
 It was whatever it was.

1:38:17.860 --> 1:38:21.460
 And I just kind of struck me that right now

1:38:21.460 --> 1:38:24.180
 we're doing stuff that you're gonna reminisce about later

1:38:24.180 --> 1:38:26.540
 that seems kind of ordinary to be like,

1:38:26.540 --> 1:38:29.060
 man, that was such a great time.

1:38:29.060 --> 1:38:31.540
 So the idea is be in the moment and all that stuff.

1:38:31.540 --> 1:38:34.460
 But these are the good old days.

1:38:34.460 --> 1:38:37.180
 And enjoy it and soak it in

1:38:37.180 --> 1:38:39.420
 and kind of be present for it.

1:38:39.420 --> 1:38:42.340
 Yeah, it's a great perspective to take on the present

1:38:42.340 --> 1:38:44.340
 because we are in the thing that we'll remember.

1:38:44.340 --> 1:38:46.180
 We're living through the thing we'll remember.

1:38:46.180 --> 1:38:47.660
 And sometimes the things we'll remember

1:38:47.660 --> 1:38:49.900
 is the simple stuff, the little stuff.

1:38:52.620 --> 1:38:55.700
 Outside of Keith Richards,

1:38:55.700 --> 1:38:58.580
 who is the greatest, ridiculous question,

1:38:58.580 --> 1:39:00.140
 but just indulge me,

1:39:00.140 --> 1:39:03.140
 who is the greatest blues guitarist of all time,

1:39:03.140 --> 1:39:04.620
 rock guitarist of all time?

1:39:05.660 --> 1:39:07.180
 Well, you got a little bit of a hybrid

1:39:07.180 --> 1:39:08.460
 with Jimi Hendrix, right?

1:39:08.460 --> 1:39:11.380
 Because he played the blues and he played rock and roll.

1:39:11.380 --> 1:39:14.540
 So I think most guitarists would say

1:39:14.540 --> 1:39:17.900
 Jimi Hendrix was pretty ridiculous.

1:39:17.900 --> 1:39:19.100
 That probably for me,

1:39:19.100 --> 1:39:21.660
 I'm a huge, huge, huge Hendrix fan to play.

1:39:21.660 --> 1:39:24.740
 He can't, I mean, even to this day,

1:39:24.740 --> 1:39:27.180
 I don't care, technology, pedals, whatever,

1:39:27.180 --> 1:39:31.460
 he just somehow fused with the instrument.

1:39:31.460 --> 1:39:34.660
 I can't be sitting here in Austin, Texas

1:39:34.660 --> 1:39:37.900
 without mentioning one of the great guitar players

1:39:37.900 --> 1:39:40.220
 of all time, Stevie Ray Vaughn.

1:39:40.220 --> 1:39:42.260
 See, that's how, I know you're like a rock star.

1:39:42.260 --> 1:39:43.780
 You're sucking up to the audience.

1:39:43.780 --> 1:39:47.460
 Well, no, you have listeners all over the place,

1:39:47.460 --> 1:39:51.020
 but Stevie Ray Vaughn is another one of those.

1:39:51.020 --> 1:39:51.860
 That is incredible.

1:39:51.860 --> 1:39:53.620
 Just blows me away.

1:39:55.180 --> 1:39:57.100
 And then with the older guys,

1:39:57.100 --> 1:40:01.020
 BB King, Hubert Sumlin, Clapton.

1:40:01.020 --> 1:40:06.020
 I saw him on his last tour

1:40:06.340 --> 1:40:08.860
 and just walked out on my,

1:40:09.900 --> 1:40:12.660
 just like unbelievable how he still sounds.

1:40:14.660 --> 1:40:18.580
 And both electric and acoustic, just so strange.

1:40:18.580 --> 1:40:19.660
 Absolute master.

1:40:20.900 --> 1:40:23.980
 And the greatest storyteller, you mentioned Bob Seger.

1:40:23.980 --> 1:40:26.260
 That's an interesting one.

1:40:26.260 --> 1:40:30.620
 He almost doesn't get enough credit, I feel like,

1:40:30.620 --> 1:40:31.500
 for how great he is.

1:40:31.500 --> 1:40:33.340
 Obviously he's super famous, but.

1:40:33.340 --> 1:40:36.500
 No, he's, and his voice.

1:40:36.500 --> 1:40:39.180
 I also, I had the privilege of getting friendly

1:40:39.180 --> 1:40:43.580
 with John Fogerty, you know, John Fogerty and CCR fame.

1:40:43.580 --> 1:40:48.100
 And he's another one that's just the way he phrases things.

1:40:48.100 --> 1:40:51.200
 And you just look at the catalog of stuff he wrote.

1:40:52.780 --> 1:40:54.000
 Amazing talent.

1:40:54.900 --> 1:40:59.580
 I read Bruce Springsteen's book

1:40:59.580 --> 1:41:02.860
 and was, I'm a fan, but after reading the book,

1:41:02.860 --> 1:41:05.820
 it was really, you go back and listen to his lyrics

1:41:05.820 --> 1:41:10.820
 and the way he pours himself out is pretty incredible.

1:41:13.500 --> 1:41:16.040
 And then again, with the old blues guys,

1:41:17.420 --> 1:41:20.660
 I just think the emotion they could get out of

1:41:20.660 --> 1:41:23.060
 playing like, staying on the one, right?

1:41:23.060 --> 1:41:25.180
 Just playing the same rhythm.

1:41:25.180 --> 1:41:27.160
 John Lee Hooker.

1:41:27.160 --> 1:41:31.180
 You listen to Manish Boy by Muddy Waters

1:41:31.180 --> 1:41:36.140
 and it's just, there's something so,

1:41:36.140 --> 1:41:38.160
 it just draws me in every time.

1:41:38.160 --> 1:41:40.880
 And the emotion they're able to get out of things.

1:41:42.040 --> 1:41:44.420
 And I'm also a huge Chuck Berry fan.

1:41:44.420 --> 1:41:47.040
 I just think that sound is, I love it.

1:41:48.900 --> 1:41:51.080
 Do you know how to play Johnny B. Goode?

1:41:51.080 --> 1:41:51.920
 I do.

1:41:53.780 --> 1:41:55.000
 That's good.

1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:59.020
 Maybe one of the great moments, at least of my childhood,

1:41:59.020 --> 1:42:04.020
 was back to the future and watching Michael J. Fox plug in

1:42:06.060 --> 1:42:09.340
 and then at the end, play at the dance

1:42:09.340 --> 1:42:11.940
 to save his parents with Johnny B. Goode, pretty awesome.

1:42:11.940 --> 1:42:14.780
 Yeah, the guitar is so much more than a musical instrument.

1:42:14.780 --> 1:42:17.460
 It feels like, it's like the,

1:42:17.460 --> 1:42:20.420
 in the 20th century, it's like the car.

1:42:20.420 --> 1:42:22.980
 Like it defines so much of Hollywood,

1:42:22.980 --> 1:42:25.860
 so much of a generation of what it means to be,

1:42:26.960 --> 1:42:28.800
 I don't know, what it means to be a man,

1:42:28.800 --> 1:42:31.100
 what it means to be a human in America.

1:42:31.100 --> 1:42:32.660
 It's fascinating.

1:42:32.660 --> 1:42:37.140
 Emblematic to me of a certain type of music.

1:42:37.140 --> 1:42:37.980
 Yeah.

1:42:37.980 --> 1:42:40.460
 And that's, I made a documentary years ago

1:42:40.460 --> 1:42:43.820
 called It Might Get Loud with Jimmy Page, The Edge.

1:42:43.820 --> 1:42:46.540
 I highly recommend that everybody watch that documentary.

1:42:46.540 --> 1:42:48.980
 It's an incredible celebration of the guitar.

1:42:48.980 --> 1:42:53.540
 Yeah, it says Jimmy Page, Jack White from White Stripes.

1:42:53.540 --> 1:42:54.380
 The Edge.

1:42:54.380 --> 1:42:56.500
 And The Edge from U2.

1:42:56.500 --> 1:42:57.340
 Okay, all right.

1:42:57.340 --> 1:42:59.260
 Well, now you have to tell the story of that one

1:42:59.260 --> 1:43:02.460
 because how the heck did that all come together?

1:43:02.460 --> 1:43:03.540
 Because it's so fascinating,

1:43:03.540 --> 1:43:07.360
 such different musicians all coming together,

1:43:07.360 --> 1:43:09.780
 talking about their story,

1:43:09.780 --> 1:43:11.520
 talking about how they approach the music

1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:13.760
 and also playing together a little bit

1:43:13.760 --> 1:43:15.380
 in this casual kind of setting.

1:43:15.380 --> 1:43:18.820
 Well, look, one day I came downstairs

1:43:18.820 --> 1:43:21.060
 and the Rolling Stone magazine is sitting there

1:43:21.060 --> 1:43:25.900
 and it was the 50 top guitarists of all time, their list.

1:43:25.900 --> 1:43:29.500
 And then I had some other financial report with video games

1:43:29.500 --> 1:43:32.940
 and the top video game at the time was Guitar Hero, right?

1:43:32.940 --> 1:43:35.220
 And then there was a third thing, I can't recall it,

1:43:35.220 --> 1:43:37.340
 but I just, and I said to myself,

1:43:37.340 --> 1:43:42.340
 what is it about the guitar that is so central

1:43:42.580 --> 1:43:45.020
 to the rock and roll, whatever you wanna call it?

1:43:45.020 --> 1:43:46.940
 Like, why is that the symbol?

1:43:46.940 --> 1:43:51.940
 And I said to myself, I wanna ask Jimmy Page

1:43:52.060 --> 1:43:54.220
 why he picked up the guitar,

1:43:54.220 --> 1:43:56.160
 because he's Jimmy Page, right?

1:43:56.160 --> 1:44:00.520
 And so I called a friend of mine, Davis Guggenheim,

1:44:00.520 --> 1:44:02.580
 who had directed Inconvenient Truth,

1:44:02.580 --> 1:44:03.680
 and I think still is,

1:44:03.680 --> 1:44:06.780
 but at the time was the biggest documentary ever.

1:44:06.780 --> 1:44:09.100
 And I called Davis and I said, look, I have this idea.

1:44:09.100 --> 1:44:12.960
 I wanna make this movie about the guitar,

1:44:12.960 --> 1:44:15.520
 about different eras and styles and whatever,

1:44:15.520 --> 1:44:16.980
 but I've never made a documentary.

1:44:16.980 --> 1:44:18.140
 I don't know how to do that.

1:44:18.140 --> 1:44:20.420
 So I was just looking for advice.

1:44:20.420 --> 1:44:24.160
 And thankfully, because he's one

1:44:24.160 --> 1:44:27.920
 of the best documentarians ever, Davis is like,

1:44:27.920 --> 1:44:29.540
 you know what, I can't get this out of my head.

1:44:29.540 --> 1:44:32.500
 I'll direct it, which was amazing.

1:44:32.500 --> 1:44:34.540
 And we wrote three names down

1:44:34.540 --> 1:44:38.220
 that represented different eras and different styles.

1:44:38.220 --> 1:44:41.760
 Rarely do you get, you go three for three,

1:44:41.760 --> 1:44:44.740
 but it was those three guys.

1:44:44.740 --> 1:44:49.740
 And it was just such a incredible experience

1:44:49.940 --> 1:44:53.580
 to sit there and get to know Jimmy Page.

1:44:53.580 --> 1:44:55.060
 You know, I mean, it was like,

1:44:55.060 --> 1:44:57.580
 and he was like Gandalf, man.

1:44:57.580 --> 1:45:00.340
 He was like always Jimmy Page.

1:45:00.340 --> 1:45:02.060
 And...

1:45:02.060 --> 1:45:03.780
 That was so cool to see him.

1:45:03.780 --> 1:45:06.700
 Gandalf was, there's like a wisdom,

1:45:06.700 --> 1:45:08.820
 there's a calmness to him compared

1:45:08.820 --> 1:45:12.620
 to like the restlessness of Jack White.

1:45:12.620 --> 1:45:16.780
 Like the, I mean, that combination was just fascinating.

1:45:16.780 --> 1:45:19.780
 It was one of the coolest experiences ever.

1:45:19.780 --> 1:45:22.140
 And one of the things, there was a moment

1:45:22.140 --> 1:45:26.240
 where Jimmy, he was going through his guitar case

1:45:26.240 --> 1:45:28.180
 and he had the double neck from stairway to heaven

1:45:28.180 --> 1:45:30.700
 and he handed it to me and I was like, mm hmm.

1:45:32.120 --> 1:45:36.940
 I mean, it's like somebody handing you X caliber or something.

1:45:36.940 --> 1:45:38.140
 Amazing experience.

1:45:38.140 --> 1:45:40.980
 And The Edge, one of the kindest human beings

1:45:40.980 --> 1:45:42.660
 you'll ever meet in your life.

1:45:42.660 --> 1:45:44.900
 Just an amazing person.

1:45:44.900 --> 1:45:47.060
 And I think he hit it right on the head with Jack

1:45:47.060 --> 1:45:49.820
 is he's got that energy, you know,

1:45:49.820 --> 1:45:52.240
 and constantly pushing himself.

1:45:52.240 --> 1:45:55.380
 But it's hard to believe it's been, I think 10 or 11

1:45:55.380 --> 1:45:58.100
 or maybe even 12 years since it came out, but.

1:45:58.100 --> 1:46:02.700
 After watching it, I realized like how much it was needed.

1:46:02.700 --> 1:46:07.340
 And I was almost surprised it didn't already exist.

1:46:07.340 --> 1:46:12.300
 It was like, yeah, the guitar wasn't quite celebrated

1:46:12.300 --> 1:46:13.180
 like explicitly.

1:46:13.180 --> 1:46:14.760
 We almost didn't acknowledge it.

1:46:15.700 --> 1:46:17.660
 How important it was culturally.

1:46:17.660 --> 1:46:18.500
 It's kind of amazing.

1:46:18.500 --> 1:46:20.540
 And the way it closed from the song, the.

1:46:20.540 --> 1:46:21.380
 The Wait.

1:46:21.380 --> 1:46:23.400
 It was called The Wait, yeah, by the band.

1:46:23.400 --> 1:46:24.660
 Yeah. Yeah.

1:46:24.660 --> 1:46:26.860
 That's because they didn't want to go home.

1:46:26.860 --> 1:46:30.000
 We were shooting on a Warner Brothers soundstage

1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:32.020
 for three days when we called it The Summit

1:46:32.020 --> 1:46:34.300
 where the three of them came together.

1:46:34.300 --> 1:46:36.420
 And the two things I'll never forget

1:46:36.420 --> 1:46:39.700
 is when Jimmy starts to play the riff

1:46:39.700 --> 1:46:40.820
 from Whole Lotta Love.

1:46:40.820 --> 1:46:41.900
 Yeah.

1:46:41.900 --> 1:46:46.420
 Edge and Jack ceased to be rock, you know,

1:46:46.420 --> 1:46:47.620
 rock gods or whatever,

1:46:47.620 --> 1:46:51.620
 and had the same 15 year old kid feeling that I did.

1:46:51.620 --> 1:46:53.340
 You could see in their face.

1:46:53.340 --> 1:46:55.620
 And then at the end, they're like, hey, can we play?

1:46:55.620 --> 1:46:57.040
 We just want to, we don't want to go.

1:46:57.040 --> 1:46:59.580
 Can we just play something acoustically?

1:46:59.580 --> 1:47:00.860
 So we printed out the lyrics.

1:47:00.860 --> 1:47:01.960
 That's what they wanted to play.

1:47:01.960 --> 1:47:05.420
 And they just sat there and sat on those couches

1:47:05.420 --> 1:47:06.540
 and just.

1:47:06.540 --> 1:47:07.540
 Such a good way to end.

1:47:07.540 --> 1:47:08.380
 Yeah.

1:47:08.380 --> 1:47:09.400
 Incredible.

1:47:09.400 --> 1:47:12.460
 What's your guitar rig setup like?

1:47:12.460 --> 1:47:15.340
 You have a few guitars.

1:47:15.340 --> 1:47:17.540
 First, let's just put on the line.

1:47:17.540 --> 1:47:21.820
 So what's better, Les Paul or Strat?

1:47:21.820 --> 1:47:24.420
 Well, I'm not going to get into what's better

1:47:24.420 --> 1:47:26.340
 because I'm sure that'll start a flood of whatever.

1:47:26.340 --> 1:47:27.840
 For me.

1:47:27.840 --> 1:47:29.180
 I'm going to say it's Strat.

1:47:29.180 --> 1:47:30.020
 All right.

1:47:30.020 --> 1:47:31.980
 I'm a Les Paul.

1:47:31.980 --> 1:47:34.700
 My main instrument is a Les Paul.

1:47:34.700 --> 1:47:36.700
 But I, okay, let me just put it on the table.

1:47:36.700 --> 1:47:39.020
 I'm speaking as somebody who literally,

1:47:39.020 --> 1:47:41.660
 I don't think I've ever actually strummed a chord

1:47:41.660 --> 1:47:42.500
 on a Les Paul.

1:47:42.500 --> 1:47:45.340
 So I've been, maybe I'm uninitiated.

1:47:45.340 --> 1:47:46.180
 Exactly.

1:47:46.180 --> 1:47:47.980
 So I don't, I don't speak from experience,

1:47:47.980 --> 1:47:50.500
 but it's probably because of Hendrix

1:47:50.500 --> 1:47:52.200
 is so deeply influenced by Hendrix

1:47:52.200 --> 1:47:55.220
 that I just kind of follow in his footsteps

1:47:55.220 --> 1:47:56.640
 and clap them and so on.

1:47:56.640 --> 1:48:01.100
 The amazing thing to me is if you look back at Leo Fender

1:48:01.100 --> 1:48:03.620
 and what the Gibson Guitar Company and Les Paul did

1:48:03.620 --> 1:48:07.460
 in the fifties, those are still the shapes

1:48:07.460 --> 1:48:09.700
 and the perfect thing today, right?

1:48:09.700 --> 1:48:12.940
 The Strat and the Telecaster and the Les Paul.

1:48:12.940 --> 1:48:15.660
 And it's, they got it right way back, way back then.

1:48:15.660 --> 1:48:20.660
 So I have my main guitar, you got to name your guitar.

1:48:21.300 --> 1:48:26.300
 So my main guitar is named Hazel and it's a 59 Les Paul.

1:48:26.300 --> 1:48:31.020
 And there's something magical in that year,

1:48:31.020 --> 1:48:34.160
 like a Stradivarius and they're just,

1:48:34.160 --> 1:48:36.900
 there's something different about them.

1:48:36.900 --> 1:48:41.900
 So I play that and then I play it through sort of

1:48:41.980 --> 1:48:46.980
 my main rig is either a 59 Fender Twin or a 65 Marshall.

1:48:50.540 --> 1:48:52.880
 And then when we're on the road now,

1:48:52.880 --> 1:48:54.900
 cause when you use older vintage stuff,

1:48:54.900 --> 1:48:56.980
 you just got to be super careful with the tubes

1:48:56.980 --> 1:48:58.760
 and everything, it has to be reliable.

1:48:58.760 --> 1:49:01.340
 So very nicely, the guys from Two Rock

1:49:01.340 --> 1:49:03.660
 sent me some of their amps and they're really,

1:49:03.660 --> 1:49:05.500
 cause I don't use any new stuff,

1:49:05.500 --> 1:49:07.480
 but the Two Rock stuff is pretty great.

1:49:07.480 --> 1:49:08.320
 So that's actually what I'm using.

1:49:08.320 --> 1:49:11.120
 Oh, it gets close to the sound that you like

1:49:11.120 --> 1:49:11.960
 with the Marshall.

1:49:11.960 --> 1:49:14.020
 Yeah, it's new and reliable.

1:49:14.020 --> 1:49:15.460
 So that's what I'm using on the road right now.

1:49:15.460 --> 1:49:17.240
 Do people use like emulation?

1:49:17.240 --> 1:49:18.200
 Do they use software?

1:49:18.200 --> 1:49:19.220
 Is it still?

1:49:19.220 --> 1:49:20.060
 They do.

1:49:20.060 --> 1:49:23.680
 I personally don't, I go, I don't have many pedals.

1:49:23.680 --> 1:49:28.020
 I use a Klon, an old vintage Klon straight into the amp.

1:49:28.020 --> 1:49:30.980
 As old school as possible.

1:49:30.980 --> 1:49:32.500
 Is there other cool guitars you have

1:49:32.500 --> 1:49:34.540
 that kind of stand out?

1:49:34.540 --> 1:49:38.320
 I have a bunch of what they call Blackguard Telecasters

1:49:38.320 --> 1:49:42.140
 from the 50s, which are pretty great.

1:49:42.140 --> 1:49:44.020
 What are those, Blackguard Telecasters?

1:49:44.020 --> 1:49:45.780
 Yeah, so they just, you know, it's in the 50s.

1:49:45.780 --> 1:49:47.900
 Oh, they actually legit have a Blackguard.

1:49:47.900 --> 1:49:48.740
 Pickguard.

1:49:48.740 --> 1:49:49.580
 Got it.

1:49:49.580 --> 1:49:51.300
 But they're incredible, so.

1:49:51.300 --> 1:49:53.220
 What's the color of the Telecaster itself?

1:49:53.220 --> 1:49:55.200
 Most of them are yellow with black

1:49:55.200 --> 1:49:57.400
 and then they got into different configurations,

1:49:57.400 --> 1:50:01.580
 but there's something, I have a 51 Telecaster

1:50:01.580 --> 1:50:04.720
 that I play in Open G, and in songs with Open G,

1:50:04.720 --> 1:50:09.020
 that just, again, there's something, you know,

1:50:09.020 --> 1:50:11.020
 and I'll take all the help I can get

1:50:11.020 --> 1:50:13.200
 in terms of making it sound great.

1:50:13.200 --> 1:50:15.840
 So I'll try to find the magic ones.

1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:18.120
 What's your writing process like

1:50:18.120 --> 1:50:21.620
 for the music and the lyrics?

1:50:21.620 --> 1:50:26.120
 Is there, do you have to go to the mountains?

1:50:26.120 --> 1:50:27.620
 Is there whiskey involved?

1:50:27.620 --> 1:50:28.700
 What do you have to do?

1:50:28.700 --> 1:50:29.900
 Or do you just write a little bit

1:50:29.900 --> 1:50:31.780
 whenever you have a moment of free time?

1:50:31.780 --> 1:50:33.780
 I'm a boring guy, because I don't drink.

1:50:33.780 --> 1:50:37.600
 I don't, I just, I figure I can screw things up plenty

1:50:37.600 --> 1:50:39.780
 on my own without adding anything.

1:50:39.780 --> 1:50:40.940
 It's a good call.

1:50:40.940 --> 1:50:45.940
 But, you know, for me, it either starts with a riff,

1:50:46.380 --> 1:50:49.920
 just something that I think is an interesting,

1:50:50.840 --> 1:50:54.220
 you know, riff or tone that I can kind of sink my teeth

1:50:54.220 --> 1:50:55.780
 into a little bit.

1:50:55.780 --> 1:51:00.140
 And a lot of times I'll write a title and love a title

1:51:00.140 --> 1:51:02.540
 and then start to back it up.

1:51:02.540 --> 1:51:04.420
 So the title is almost like an idea.

1:51:04.420 --> 1:51:06.900
 Yeah, like this is where I want to be

1:51:07.940 --> 1:51:10.260
 and then start kind of writing it out.

1:51:10.260 --> 1:51:13.940
 And again, I just have to know,

1:51:13.940 --> 1:51:16.500
 am I writing from a character's point of view?

1:51:16.500 --> 1:51:19.860
 Am I writing about someone or something,

1:51:19.860 --> 1:51:22.060
 you know, as like the narrator?

1:51:22.060 --> 1:51:23.700
 And, you know, what is this person?

1:51:23.700 --> 1:51:24.540
 Are they happy?

1:51:24.540 --> 1:51:25.380
 Are they sad?

1:51:25.380 --> 1:51:26.220
 Are they happy?

1:51:26.220 --> 1:51:27.300
 Where are they in life?

1:51:27.300 --> 1:51:29.900
 I don't know if all that, like,

1:51:29.900 --> 1:51:32.460
 great writers, I'm sure, would say,

1:51:32.460 --> 1:51:34.140
 why don't you just write?

1:51:34.140 --> 1:51:36.060
 You don't need all that.

1:51:36.060 --> 1:51:38.380
 But that's, for me, that's my process.

1:51:38.380 --> 1:51:39.940
 Well, I'm not so sure about that.

1:51:39.940 --> 1:51:43.540
 I bet you quite a lot of writers have

1:51:43.540 --> 1:51:45.900
 created a world in their mind

1:51:45.900 --> 1:51:48.780
 before they even put the simplest of words down.

1:51:48.780 --> 1:51:51.620
 So yeah, there's quite a lot to that.

1:51:51.620 --> 1:51:52.460
 Yeah.

1:51:54.980 --> 1:51:56.620
 What's your favorite song to play?

1:51:57.780 --> 1:52:00.580
 Is there some favorite ones you go to?

1:52:00.580 --> 1:52:04.500
 But both play and kind of, I'm sure you love singing.

1:52:04.500 --> 1:52:05.420
 Oh, no, no, no.

1:52:05.420 --> 1:52:06.780
 No, you don't?

1:52:06.780 --> 1:52:10.860
 I'm not, I'm neither talented nor do I have the desire.

1:52:10.860 --> 1:52:14.220
 And I think, you know, if you come see the show,

1:52:14.220 --> 1:52:16.500
 you won't see a microphone anywhere near me.

1:52:16.500 --> 1:52:18.020
 But do you, I mean, do you hear,

1:52:18.020 --> 1:52:19.420
 like when you're thinking about lyrics,

1:52:19.420 --> 1:52:21.860
 do you hear the idea of the words?

1:52:21.860 --> 1:52:22.700
 100%.

1:52:22.700 --> 1:52:26.300
 And especially what's great with Trey

1:52:26.300 --> 1:52:28.620
 is I write for his voice.

1:52:28.620 --> 1:52:32.180
 And then we have these amazing backup singers

1:52:32.180 --> 1:52:35.220
 that are just, and I can hear all of it,

1:52:35.220 --> 1:52:36.500
 I just can't do it.

1:52:37.860 --> 1:52:41.700
 And so I'd say of our stuff,

1:52:41.700 --> 1:52:44.420
 there's a song called Half My Fault

1:52:44.420 --> 1:52:47.340
 that I play in Open G that just,

1:52:47.340 --> 1:52:49.060
 I love playing the song.

1:52:49.060 --> 1:52:50.540
 I love that energy.

1:52:50.540 --> 1:52:53.980
 And then there's, we have a new blues album coming out

1:52:53.980 --> 1:52:58.980
 and there's a song called Baby We're Through

1:52:59.220 --> 1:53:01.300
 and it just stays on the one.

1:53:01.300 --> 1:53:03.860
 And if for non musicians, that means,

1:53:03.860 --> 1:53:05.580
 like in a lot of rock and roll and blues,

1:53:05.580 --> 1:53:09.340
 it's what's called a one, four, five progression

1:53:09.340 --> 1:53:11.020
 from your kind of root note.

1:53:11.020 --> 1:53:13.140
 And you would hear, if you're a non musician,

1:53:13.140 --> 1:53:14.180
 if you heard it, you'd be like,

1:53:14.180 --> 1:53:16.540
 oh yeah, that's a lot of songs.

1:53:16.540 --> 1:53:18.980
 And this song just stays on the same groove.

1:53:18.980 --> 1:53:23.420
 Like La Grange or Shake Your Hips or any of those songs.

1:53:23.420 --> 1:53:26.900
 And it's just got this unbelievable energy

1:53:26.900 --> 1:53:27.740
 and it's fun to play,

1:53:27.740 --> 1:53:31.340
 but I have to keep the same rhythmic thing going

1:53:31.340 --> 1:53:32.820
 for the whole song.

1:53:32.820 --> 1:53:33.980
 With that simplicity, I mean,

1:53:33.980 --> 1:53:36.660
 the personality of the song can really shine.

1:53:36.660 --> 1:53:41.660
 I mean, Trey's, I mean, that guy, really cool.

1:53:42.180 --> 1:53:44.060
 He just comes through.

1:53:44.060 --> 1:53:45.700
 I mean, I guess you need that from a lead singer.

1:53:45.700 --> 1:53:47.380
 He's just, he's just.

1:53:47.380 --> 1:53:50.180
 You gotta have that, and my other guitar player,

1:53:50.180 --> 1:53:53.980
 Johnny Bob is, he's a phenomenal,

1:53:53.980 --> 1:53:57.340
 I mean, like a legitimate guitar slinger.

1:53:58.940 --> 1:54:03.260
 You know, we probably split the leads 70, 30,

1:54:03.260 --> 1:54:06.100
 and he is just, you know,

1:54:06.100 --> 1:54:07.980
 there's times sometimes I look over at him

1:54:07.980 --> 1:54:09.460
 and I'm like, I'm being a fan right now

1:54:09.460 --> 1:54:12.660
 because what you just laid down is pretty good.

1:54:12.660 --> 1:54:16.260
 From a lead perspective, what's the most fun thing to play?

1:54:16.260 --> 1:54:18.460
 What kind of stuff do you, do you like slow?

1:54:18.460 --> 1:54:21.780
 Do you like, I mean, if you, like, thrill is gone.

1:54:21.780 --> 1:54:23.020
 So if you look at B.B. King,

1:54:23.020 --> 1:54:25.820
 sometimes one note just bending the shit out of that.

1:54:25.820 --> 1:54:27.460
 What do you call that, vibrato?

1:54:27.460 --> 1:54:30.260
 If I'm gonna play the lead, it's a certain kind of feel.

1:54:30.260 --> 1:54:33.860
 Slow blues is probably my favorite to play,

1:54:33.860 --> 1:54:35.460
 or something that's got a little more

1:54:35.460 --> 1:54:37.820
 of that Chuck Berry drive

1:54:37.820 --> 1:54:39.980
 where you can be rhythmic in the lead.

1:54:41.980 --> 1:54:45.220
 You know, I can't, the shredding thing that those guys do

1:54:45.220 --> 1:54:47.580
 is, that's not my.

1:54:47.580 --> 1:54:51.340
 I was actually always able to do that really well.

1:54:51.340 --> 1:54:53.540
 Like, you mentioned people that pick up fast,

1:54:53.540 --> 1:54:55.820
 like, maybe it's the classical piano training.

1:54:55.820 --> 1:54:58.820
 I can play super fast on guitar, super technical.

1:54:58.820 --> 1:55:02.020
 But to me, the hardest thing and my favorite thing

1:55:02.020 --> 1:55:06.340
 is just, it's probably less to do with the guitar,

1:55:06.340 --> 1:55:09.940
 more living on life that's worth playing a guitar for.

1:55:10.860 --> 1:55:13.580
 It's like a certain kind of emotion

1:55:13.580 --> 1:55:15.500
 that you can put into the notes.

1:55:15.500 --> 1:55:17.580
 And that has to do with bending notes well.

1:55:17.580 --> 1:55:20.820
 Like, bending notes is a whole other art form of,

1:55:22.540 --> 1:55:26.340
 I worked surprisingly a long time on Comfortably Numb.

1:55:28.540 --> 1:55:31.940
 And there's, so David Gilmour, there's a lot of bending.

1:55:31.940 --> 1:55:35.300
 And they're simple, they sound simple.

1:55:35.300 --> 1:55:39.260
 But the dynamics of them,

1:55:40.140 --> 1:55:43.300
 to express like a build up in the way it's held

1:55:43.300 --> 1:55:46.980
 and there's often a vibrato at the top for a bit.

1:55:46.980 --> 1:55:51.980
 Just that, it's almost like a sigh

1:55:52.620 --> 1:55:54.420
 and a sigh of relief and the build up.

1:55:54.420 --> 1:55:58.100
 I mean, that's an art form for him that's hard to get right.

1:55:58.100 --> 1:56:00.220
 It's not just playing a note, playing a note,

1:56:00.220 --> 1:56:04.660
 playing a note, it's in that like dynamic movement

1:56:04.660 --> 1:56:06.420
 of a note that so much can happen.

1:56:06.420 --> 1:56:08.900
 That's where the blues happens to.

1:56:08.900 --> 1:56:11.420
 Look, I'm a huge Freddie King fan too, right?

1:56:11.420 --> 1:56:14.380
 And you listen to these guys and they're,

1:56:15.980 --> 1:56:17.020
 you sit there and they're like,

1:56:17.020 --> 1:56:21.420
 man, you're playing in a small range on the neck.

1:56:22.540 --> 1:56:26.860
 But, you know, it's like, I know the notes you're playing

1:56:26.860 --> 1:56:30.340
 and I'm playing them too, but not like that, right?

1:56:30.340 --> 1:56:33.420
 I mean, it's, and Gilmour is certainly one of those guys

1:56:33.420 --> 1:56:35.980
 that's an incredible guitar player.

1:56:35.980 --> 1:56:40.500
 And yet another chapter of an amazing life.

1:56:40.500 --> 1:56:41.940
 You love football, like you mentioned.

1:56:41.940 --> 1:56:43.020
 You play football?

1:56:43.020 --> 1:56:43.860
 Yes.

1:56:43.860 --> 1:56:44.700
 What position do you play?

1:56:44.700 --> 1:56:45.520
 Wide receiver.

1:56:45.520 --> 1:56:46.360
 Wide receiver.

1:56:47.420 --> 1:56:48.260
 Awesome.

1:56:48.260 --> 1:56:52.780
 So, maybe we can talk a little bit about your love

1:56:52.780 --> 1:56:57.780
 of football and the fact that you are part owner

1:56:58.700 --> 1:57:00.740
 of the Pittsburgh Steelers.

1:57:00.740 --> 1:57:01.580
 Yeah.

1:57:01.580 --> 1:57:02.820
 So, I mean, where do we start?

1:57:02.820 --> 1:57:05.220
 You start at the beginning, let's start at the end.

1:57:05.220 --> 1:57:06.780
 Why the Steelers?

1:57:06.780 --> 1:57:09.580
 What attracted you to the, first of all,

1:57:09.580 --> 1:57:12.620
 I think not to be controversial,

1:57:12.620 --> 1:57:15.980
 but one of the best uniforms in football

1:57:15.980 --> 1:57:19.100
 in terms of just the black and gold, just.

1:57:19.100 --> 1:57:20.860
 Decal only on one side.

1:57:20.860 --> 1:57:21.860
 Yeah, it's great.

1:57:21.860 --> 1:57:23.100
 Yeah, the helmet.

1:57:23.100 --> 1:57:27.100
 Look, I've bled black and gold since I was a little boy.

1:57:27.100 --> 1:57:29.540
 I grew up in upstate New York.

1:57:29.540 --> 1:57:32.420
 And the first football game I ever saw

1:57:32.420 --> 1:57:35.740
 was the Steelers in the Super Bowl is a really little kit.

1:57:35.740 --> 1:57:39.940
 And it just, I mean, Jack Lambert and Joe Green

1:57:39.940 --> 1:57:41.900
 and Franco Harris and those guys were like,

1:57:41.900 --> 1:57:45.660
 came down from Olympia, Mount Olympus or something.

1:57:45.660 --> 1:57:48.500
 And I just was enamored with the team.

1:57:48.500 --> 1:57:50.780
 And because we only had three channels,

1:57:50.780 --> 1:57:53.060
 the only time I'd get to see them is occasionally

1:57:53.060 --> 1:57:55.600
 when they were the game of the week or something.

1:57:57.020 --> 1:58:02.020
 And I just loved to me what they stood for, the toughness

1:58:02.020 --> 1:58:07.020
 and they played football the way that I thought was great.

1:58:08.140 --> 1:58:10.060
 I was a huge Jack Lambert fan,

1:58:11.020 --> 1:58:15.820
 our Hall of Fame linebacker who just intimidated everybody.

1:58:15.820 --> 1:58:16.940
 So that was like the,

1:58:16.940 --> 1:58:19.360
 that was the decade of the steel curtain.

1:58:21.500 --> 1:58:24.580
 I mean, arguably one of the great sort of defensive

1:58:24.580 --> 1:58:28.620
 in football history and also one of the greatest

1:58:28.620 --> 1:58:32.380
 football teams period of in football history.

1:58:32.380 --> 1:58:37.220
 I've been a lifelong fan and was very fortunate

1:58:37.220 --> 1:58:38.780
 to meet Mr. Rooney.

1:58:39.820 --> 1:58:43.000
 The Rooney family started the team in 1933,

1:58:44.060 --> 1:58:48.860
 got to know him and just was asked to be part

1:58:48.860 --> 1:58:49.740
 of the ownership group.

1:58:49.740 --> 1:58:52.520
 I think it was the end of 2007,

1:58:52.520 --> 1:58:54.500
 first year as part of the group in 2008,

1:58:54.500 --> 1:58:56.100
 we won the Super Bowl.

1:58:56.100 --> 1:59:01.100
 And it was like beyond surreal and just beyond surreal.

1:59:01.860 --> 1:59:06.860
 And it's amazing to be able to do.

1:59:07.860 --> 1:59:12.860
 I mean, the Rooney family is one of those most revered

1:59:13.020 --> 1:59:16.780
 in sports for the way they conduct themselves.

1:59:16.780 --> 1:59:20.980
 Mr. Rooney passed away, I think five years ago now

1:59:20.980 --> 1:59:23.960
 and we lost him, but was a champion, helped build the league.

1:59:23.960 --> 1:59:27.300
 I mean, put the league as we know it together.

1:59:27.300 --> 1:59:29.860
 More importantly, it was a civil rights champion

1:59:30.820 --> 1:59:33.380
 who created what we now call the Rooney rule

1:59:34.220 --> 1:59:36.020
 to make sure that we're being fair

1:59:36.020 --> 1:59:40.460
 about giving minority coaches a chance to get hired.

1:59:40.460 --> 1:59:44.700
 And just is one of the most kind

1:59:44.700 --> 1:59:47.880
 and amazing human beings I ever met.

1:59:47.880 --> 1:59:51.960
 It's incredible what sport does.

1:59:51.960 --> 1:59:56.000
 Like to bring out the best in people,

1:59:56.000 --> 1:59:58.360
 to give people hope, to inspire people.

1:59:58.360 --> 1:59:59.880
 There's something about football

1:59:59.880 --> 2:00:04.880
 that has all the elements of a great sport.

2:00:04.900 --> 2:00:09.900
 It's the teamwork, it's the sort of the combat aspect of it.

2:00:10.320 --> 2:00:11.880
 It's like, it's the purity of it.

2:00:11.880 --> 2:00:16.880
 It's of like strength and power and speed

2:00:16.880 --> 2:00:21.700
 and all the elements of like last minute,

2:00:21.700 --> 2:00:25.100
 close calls required to win the game.

2:00:25.100 --> 2:00:28.140
 And where referee decisions, of course,

2:00:28.140 --> 2:00:30.940
 that's essential for a sport can screw up the whole thing.

2:00:30.940 --> 2:00:32.220
 Just got all of it together.

2:00:32.220 --> 2:00:36.980
 I think just, I don't know, it gives the drama

2:00:36.980 --> 2:00:40.060
 and the triumphs are just beautiful.

2:00:40.060 --> 2:00:42.500
 Like some of my favorite memories,

2:00:42.500 --> 2:00:43.700
 I don't know if it's an accident

2:00:43.700 --> 2:00:45.640
 or this is common with people,

2:00:45.640 --> 2:00:48.340
 it's just with friends watching football

2:00:48.340 --> 2:00:50.020
 and connecting over that.

2:00:51.300 --> 2:00:54.180
 Yeah, well, look, it's an incredible game

2:00:54.180 --> 2:00:56.100
 because there's nowhere to hide, right?

2:00:56.100 --> 2:00:57.700
 You're out there on the field.

2:00:57.700 --> 2:01:02.100
 You know, it's a great game that requires

2:01:02.100 --> 2:01:04.340
 not only all those attributes that you said,

2:01:04.340 --> 2:01:07.600
 but it's incredibly complex game.

2:01:07.600 --> 2:01:09.180
 So if you don't know what you're looking at

2:01:09.180 --> 2:01:11.660
 and you don't understand how complex

2:01:11.660 --> 2:01:14.900
 defenses are trying to disguise what they're doing,

2:01:14.900 --> 2:01:17.060
 offenses are trying to overcome that

2:01:17.060 --> 2:01:22.060
 and you can set up one play the entire game,

2:01:22.300 --> 2:01:26.960
 but a team that plays well together, right?

2:01:26.960 --> 2:01:28.340
 Knows their plays inside and out,

2:01:28.340 --> 2:01:30.420
 knows their assignments inside and out,

2:01:30.420 --> 2:01:33.940
 can overcome and beat a more physically gifted team

2:01:33.940 --> 2:01:38.780
 because of that aspect of working together.

2:01:38.780 --> 2:01:43.020
 One of the things that I always loved about sports

2:01:43.020 --> 2:01:47.260
 is just you're out there, there's a set of rules

2:01:47.260 --> 2:01:48.980
 and there's a scoreboard.

2:01:48.980 --> 2:01:51.900
 So at the end of that game, it says,

2:01:51.900 --> 2:01:54.440
 and you can make excuses about the refs

2:01:54.440 --> 2:01:55.620
 or this happened or that happened,

2:01:55.620 --> 2:02:00.620
 but at the end of the day, did you go out and compete?

2:02:01.740 --> 2:02:05.700
 And when you went out and were a competitor,

2:02:05.700 --> 2:02:07.780
 how did it work out, right?

2:02:07.780 --> 2:02:10.740
 And the simplicity of that and the purity of that

2:02:10.740 --> 2:02:15.240
 is something that I always have been drawn to.

2:02:15.240 --> 2:02:18.840
 What about the business of sort of owning a team

2:02:18.840 --> 2:02:22.200
 or putting together a team or trying to like build up a team

2:02:22.200 --> 2:02:23.440
 that's going to be a great team?

2:02:23.440 --> 2:02:25.320
 Like what are some interesting aspects

2:02:25.320 --> 2:02:27.720
 that people might not realize that you can carry over

2:02:27.720 --> 2:02:31.900
 from all the other experience you have in business?

2:02:32.860 --> 2:02:36.200
 I think the hardest thing about professional sports,

2:02:36.200 --> 2:02:39.760
 right now it's individuals getting paid money

2:02:39.760 --> 2:02:42.880
 to play a sport, which is different than,

2:02:42.880 --> 2:02:45.120
 it's certainly different than amateur.

2:02:45.120 --> 2:02:48.440
 And the decisions that are hard

2:02:48.440 --> 2:02:50.600
 is when you get to know somebody

2:02:50.600 --> 2:02:52.120
 who's a player on the team

2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:55.160
 and either they're at the end of their career

2:02:55.160 --> 2:02:57.320
 or you need to go in a different direction

2:02:57.320 --> 2:03:00.840
 and that person who's done everything that you've asked,

2:03:01.760 --> 2:03:03.880
 whatever the coaches have asked of that person

2:03:03.880 --> 2:03:05.920
 and you get close to them.

2:03:05.920 --> 2:03:08.480
 And then when they have to be traded,

2:03:08.480 --> 2:03:12.080
 released or whatever happens, it's, that's sad.

2:03:12.080 --> 2:03:17.080
 And being able to stand back and in some ways

2:03:17.880 --> 2:03:20.960
 be dispassionate and not be a fan, right?

2:03:20.960 --> 2:03:25.860
 There's a, I'm on the baseball hall of fame board

2:03:25.860 --> 2:03:29.620
 and one of the guys that's on the board of me

2:03:29.620 --> 2:03:30.600
 is Jerry Reinsdorf.

2:03:30.600 --> 2:03:32.880
 And I think it was Jerry who said,

2:03:32.880 --> 2:03:35.380
 if you act like a fan, you'll be sitting with them,

2:03:36.280 --> 2:03:37.820
 which I thought was kind of funny.

2:03:37.820 --> 2:03:40.600
 Well, I got to push back on that a little bit

2:03:40.600 --> 2:03:43.740
 as a, by way of a fan asking a dumb question.

2:03:47.520 --> 2:03:49.240
 Okay, let me just give some examples.

2:03:49.240 --> 2:03:51.600
 It's very common in sport.

2:03:51.600 --> 2:03:54.360
 It's funny you said this example of like

2:03:54.360 --> 2:03:57.360
 certain great players going to another team

2:03:57.360 --> 2:03:59.060
 right at the end of their career.

2:04:00.880 --> 2:04:03.000
 And it always makes me sad.

2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:04.360
 It almost makes me want to wish

2:04:04.360 --> 2:04:09.360
 that he kind of retired right there from a perspective

2:04:09.360 --> 2:04:13.720
 of just like, do you ever, as a owner,

2:04:13.720 --> 2:04:18.720
 but just in that space, think about like the Steelers

2:04:18.720 --> 2:04:21.640
 in the full arc of human history.

2:04:21.640 --> 2:04:23.940
 So not like as a business.

2:04:23.940 --> 2:04:26.200
 I mean, okay, this question might be absurd.

2:04:26.200 --> 2:04:28.640
 I don't have to think about it as a business.

2:04:28.640 --> 2:04:30.500
 You know, I'm a minority owner,

2:04:30.500 --> 2:04:33.080
 so I can think about it almost as a fan,

2:04:33.080 --> 2:04:34.120
 but I'm sorry, go ahead.

2:04:34.120 --> 2:04:35.800
 Yeah, well, that's what I mean.

2:04:35.800 --> 2:04:38.440
 I suppose this is a dumb question to think of,

2:04:40.420 --> 2:04:44.840
 like of a business in that way, not just investment,

2:04:44.840 --> 2:04:49.840
 but like legacy of like what footprint

2:04:49.840 --> 2:04:52.760
 would you leave on this world, on this history?

2:04:52.760 --> 2:04:55.960
 That is one thing that I can say unequivocally,

2:04:55.960 --> 2:04:59.400
 and I only have the experience that I have.

2:04:59.400 --> 2:05:02.440
 But one of the things that I'm so proud of

2:05:02.440 --> 2:05:07.440
 about the way the Steelers conduct themselves is,

2:05:07.700 --> 2:05:08.940
 and that's the Rooney family,

2:05:08.940 --> 2:05:10.620
 that's the legacy of the Rooney family,

2:05:10.620 --> 2:05:13.500
 is asking constantly about what's right for the league,

2:05:13.500 --> 2:05:14.960
 what's right for the players,

2:05:17.100 --> 2:05:19.060
 what's the right thing to do here?

2:05:19.060 --> 2:05:22.200
 And that's something that I would hear Mr. Rooney say

2:05:22.200 --> 2:05:23.040
 all the time.

2:05:23.040 --> 2:05:25.440
 So I think that legacy is important

2:05:25.440 --> 2:05:29.640
 because ultimately the team belongs to that city, right?

2:05:29.640 --> 2:05:33.140
 Belongs to those fans and the owners

2:05:33.140 --> 2:05:35.380
 are the custodians of that.

2:05:35.380 --> 2:05:40.380
 So I think, and when you realize what sports teams mean

2:05:41.260 --> 2:05:43.580
 to the fans, the memories that it creates,

2:05:43.580 --> 2:05:47.660
 the bonds that it creates, it's a responsibility.

2:05:50.340 --> 2:05:54.140
 And I think that you do have to think beyond the,

2:05:55.020 --> 2:05:57.180
 certainly not just dollars and cents,

2:05:57.180 --> 2:06:02.180
 but just sports is a very big deal in our society.

2:06:02.980 --> 2:06:06.740
 And it has to be, I think, held to a standard

2:06:08.300 --> 2:06:12.460
 that's not just, well, were we profitable this year?

2:06:12.460 --> 2:06:14.840
 That's, there are other businesses for that.

2:06:14.840 --> 2:06:16.240
 It is certainly a business.

2:06:16.240 --> 2:06:19.220
 I don't mean to romanticize to the point that it's not,

2:06:19.220 --> 2:06:22.260
 but to me, it's more than that.

2:06:22.260 --> 2:06:24.820
 Or at least my experience has been that it's more than that.

2:06:24.820 --> 2:06:28.060
 It's a source of meaning for millions of people.

2:06:28.060 --> 2:06:32.140
 And you see that most, like during COVID, for example,

2:06:32.140 --> 2:06:33.740
 when there's so much desperation,

2:06:33.740 --> 2:06:35.500
 so many people losing their jobs,

2:06:35.500 --> 2:06:37.300
 so many people having to deal with the uncertainty

2:06:37.300 --> 2:06:38.980
 of what the future holds.

2:06:38.980 --> 2:06:42.140
 There's something about those sports that just unites us

2:06:42.140 --> 2:06:47.140
 that again, the tragedy and the triumphs of sport,

2:06:47.500 --> 2:06:50.780
 of united, of gathering together with your friends,

2:06:50.780 --> 2:06:54.100
 with family, shared experience of over like this,

2:06:54.100 --> 2:06:58.180
 yeah, over just team, over rooting for your team,

2:06:58.180 --> 2:06:59.940
 for your city ultimately.

2:06:59.940 --> 2:07:03.260
 And the access, again, as I alluded to,

2:07:03.260 --> 2:07:05.300
 we didn't have anything when I was growing up,

2:07:05.300 --> 2:07:07.780
 but I would pour through the box scores.

2:07:07.780 --> 2:07:10.340
 I was a huge Yankee fan and Steeler fan

2:07:10.340 --> 2:07:13.700
 and feeling some ownership of that, right?

2:07:13.700 --> 2:07:16.300
 That I could read the box score and relive what they did

2:07:16.300 --> 2:07:18.880
 and occasionally see them on TV

2:07:18.880 --> 2:07:22.500
 and feel like I was part of that celebration

2:07:22.500 --> 2:07:24.180
 when they won and everything.

2:07:24.180 --> 2:07:26.180
 It's a very powerful thing.

2:07:27.500 --> 2:07:30.580
 You've been exceptionally successful in a bunch of avenues

2:07:30.580 --> 2:07:31.980
 and a bunch of efforts.

2:07:31.980 --> 2:07:34.740
 What advice would you give to a young person today,

2:07:34.740 --> 2:07:38.220
 a high school student, a college undergraduate

2:07:38.220 --> 2:07:43.220
 that's thinking about career, maybe advice,

2:07:43.620 --> 2:07:46.740
 not about just career, but about how to live a life

2:07:46.740 --> 2:07:48.020
 they can be proud of?

2:07:49.140 --> 2:07:51.740
 You know, we talked earlier about intellectual honesty

2:07:51.740 --> 2:07:55.100
 and to me, that's the first step of just saying

2:07:55.100 --> 2:07:57.980
 to the best of your ability, who am I?

2:07:57.980 --> 2:07:59.940
 And what's important to me

2:07:59.940 --> 2:08:01.960
 and what do I wanna do and accomplish?

2:08:03.020 --> 2:08:05.060
 If you can start with that

2:08:05.060 --> 2:08:10.020
 and develop some sort of rules based philosophical,

2:08:10.020 --> 2:08:14.060
 here's what I'll do, what I won't do.

2:08:14.060 --> 2:08:18.200
 And that way you can be flexible and pliable

2:08:18.200 --> 2:08:19.180
 and you're gonna need to be,

2:08:19.180 --> 2:08:24.180
 but if you still have a compass that tells you,

2:08:25.140 --> 2:08:28.300
 hey, at least I know this is the path I'm gonna take,

2:08:28.300 --> 2:08:29.940
 I think that's very important.

2:08:29.940 --> 2:08:33.020
 The rules you're referring to, the principles,

2:08:33.020 --> 2:08:35.780
 that's kind of like underlying integrity.

2:08:35.780 --> 2:08:39.020
 So knowing what lines you don't cross on this path.

2:08:39.020 --> 2:08:42.780
 Exactly right, because if you have those absolutes,

2:08:42.780 --> 2:08:46.540
 there are many decisions that come into focus very quickly

2:08:46.540 --> 2:08:49.820
 because hey, that's not for me, or hey,

2:08:49.820 --> 2:08:53.980
 I'm willing to do whatever it takes to do X, Y, and Z.

2:08:53.980 --> 2:08:56.580
 And it has to do with the thing you were talking about.

2:08:56.580 --> 2:08:58.900
 It's kind of interesting, you mentioned earlier

2:08:58.900 --> 2:09:01.140
 in the conversation about slippery slope

2:09:01.140 --> 2:09:03.360
 and that's how often it happens,

2:09:03.360 --> 2:09:07.800
 like how the slipping into unethical behavior happens.

2:09:07.800 --> 2:09:09.940
 It's a slippery slope of little adjustments,

2:09:09.940 --> 2:09:13.940
 you put stuff off and I found that to be,

2:09:13.940 --> 2:09:18.940
 I've been fortunate to not have to encounter these moments

2:09:19.800 --> 2:09:22.740
 very much in my life, but I still encounter them.

2:09:22.740 --> 2:09:25.340
 That's what integrity I think looks like,

2:09:25.340 --> 2:09:29.080
 is as the slippery slope is happening,

2:09:29.080 --> 2:09:33.260
 those little things is without drama,

2:09:33.260 --> 2:09:35.980
 without making a show of it,

2:09:35.980 --> 2:09:38.620
 making a decision that stands behind your principles

2:09:38.620 --> 2:09:40.340
 and just walking away.

2:09:40.340 --> 2:09:42.920
 Yeah, and besides the big ideas,

2:09:42.920 --> 2:09:46.100
 I'm gonna change the world, I'm gonna innovate,

2:09:46.100 --> 2:09:48.080
 I'm gonna do all those other things,

2:09:48.080 --> 2:09:51.320
 I also start, if I'm giving any advice,

2:09:51.320 --> 2:09:55.820
 which we can debate whether or not I should be giving advice,

2:09:55.820 --> 2:09:59.100
 but just in terms of, well, let me start with this.

2:09:59.100 --> 2:10:01.140
 Are you a good friend?

2:10:01.140 --> 2:10:02.860
 Can you be counted on?

2:10:02.860 --> 2:10:05.260
 Do you do what you say you're going to do?

2:10:05.260 --> 2:10:07.100
 Yeah. Right?

2:10:07.100 --> 2:10:09.740
 Are you accountable to what you sign up for

2:10:09.740 --> 2:10:12.100
 and do you hold others accountable?

2:10:12.100 --> 2:10:13.740
 What does all that look like?

2:10:13.740 --> 2:10:18.740
 And then I think it's being as intellectually curious

2:10:18.820 --> 2:10:20.140
 and well read as you can be.

2:10:20.140 --> 2:10:24.540
 We live in a world that is designed to distract you, right?

2:10:24.540 --> 2:10:27.540
 And being able to sit with your thoughts

2:10:27.540 --> 2:10:30.860
 or go on a walk and think deeply about something

2:10:30.860 --> 2:10:34.660
 and not just surface area, you text me, I text you back

2:10:34.660 --> 2:10:36.620
 and we decide the fate of the world

2:10:36.620 --> 2:10:42.280
 based on a couple of text messages or something.

2:10:42.280 --> 2:10:46.580
 You don't wanna lose touch, I think, with being well read

2:10:46.580 --> 2:10:50.740
 and understanding and standing on great thinkers shoulders

2:10:50.740 --> 2:10:55.340
 and learning from those works.

2:10:55.340 --> 2:11:00.380
 And then I also think that there's resiliency

2:11:00.380 --> 2:11:02.320
 and then there's grit.

2:11:02.320 --> 2:11:04.420
 And I heard someone say one time

2:11:04.420 --> 2:11:06.860
 that those are slightly different.

2:11:06.860 --> 2:11:11.400
 And I'm also, I know that there are all kinds

2:11:11.400 --> 2:11:13.260
 of challenges in life, right?

2:11:13.260 --> 2:11:16.700
 That are tragic, that are unfair.

2:11:16.700 --> 2:11:19.300
 There's no question that's the world we live in.

2:11:19.300 --> 2:11:23.100
 But for me personally, to try as much as possible

2:11:23.100 --> 2:11:26.900
 not to be in the victim mindset

2:11:26.900 --> 2:11:30.700
 because unfair things are gonna happen.

2:11:30.700 --> 2:11:36.500
 And we all wanna live in an idealistic, just world.

2:11:36.500 --> 2:11:38.800
 That should be what we aspire to.

2:11:40.060 --> 2:11:43.020
 I haven't seen that yet, I haven't experienced that yet,

2:11:43.020 --> 2:11:47.140
 but yet you still have to function in that world.

2:11:47.140 --> 2:11:52.140
 So I think that that resiliency thing is very important.

2:11:52.740 --> 2:11:56.900
 And then putting yourself out there, right?

2:11:56.900 --> 2:12:01.380
 Because if you play scared and you're always afraid to fail,

2:12:01.380 --> 2:12:03.780
 you know, this is probably a dumb way

2:12:03.780 --> 2:12:05.160
 to get to the end of the podcast,

2:12:05.160 --> 2:12:08.700
 but there are times, especially I'm out West,

2:12:08.700 --> 2:12:13.700
 I love the big sky out in Montana, Idaho, places like that.

2:12:13.700 --> 2:12:16.100
 And when you look up at night, it's almost like

2:12:16.100 --> 2:12:18.300
 I've never seen anything like this before

2:12:18.300 --> 2:12:21.240
 because there's no light pollution, so to speak.

2:12:22.500 --> 2:12:23.940
 And sometimes when I look up,

2:12:23.940 --> 2:12:26.180
 the most daunting problems that I'm experiencing,

2:12:26.180 --> 2:12:29.620
 I'm like, those things have been there

2:12:29.620 --> 2:12:31.540
 for a billion years or whatever,

2:12:31.540 --> 2:12:34.220
 and I'll be gone and it doesn't,

2:12:35.340 --> 2:12:40.340
 the most famous person on earth 200 years ago, eh.

2:12:41.340 --> 2:12:43.820
 So it's pretty fleeting.

2:12:44.740 --> 2:12:48.020
 And so make sure you have a good journey

2:12:48.020 --> 2:12:50.500
 and especially coming out of COVID,

2:12:50.500 --> 2:12:53.700
 I think telling people that you care about them

2:12:53.700 --> 2:12:56.940
 and maintaining and cultivating your friendships

2:12:56.940 --> 2:13:00.740
 and relationships and they're not just transactional, right?

2:13:00.740 --> 2:13:04.760
 And making sure that someday when you're laying there,

2:13:04.760 --> 2:13:07.020
 you can say, yeah, I was a good family member.

2:13:07.020 --> 2:13:10.180
 I was a good friend.

2:13:10.180 --> 2:13:11.980
 I was someone that could be counted on.

2:13:11.980 --> 2:13:15.740
 I think all those things go into the mix of, you know,

2:13:15.740 --> 2:13:17.500
 however you wanna take the journey.

2:13:17.500 --> 2:13:19.020
 So when you look up to the stars,

2:13:19.020 --> 2:13:23.100
 do you think about that quickly approaching end of yours?

2:13:23.100 --> 2:13:24.580
 Do you think about your own mortality?

2:13:24.580 --> 2:13:26.100
 Do you think about your death?

2:13:26.100 --> 2:13:27.860
 Are you afraid of your death?

2:13:27.860 --> 2:13:30.420
 I'm a huge fan of stoicism, right?

2:13:30.420 --> 2:13:32.620
 I read a lot of stoicism.

2:13:34.060 --> 2:13:35.900
 I think Ryan Holiday's done a great job

2:13:35.900 --> 2:13:38.940
 of bringing some of that back into the forefront.

2:13:38.940 --> 2:13:43.420
 It's just really thought provoking to me

2:13:43.420 --> 2:13:45.740
 and rings, a lot of it rings, just hits me

2:13:45.740 --> 2:13:47.700
 and says, I think that's right.

2:13:47.700 --> 2:13:51.700
 And that Momento Mori thing, which is,

2:13:51.700 --> 2:13:55.300
 hey, we're all gonna die, so you should contemplate it.

2:13:56.220 --> 2:13:58.720
 There's a finality to this thing.

2:13:58.720 --> 2:14:03.060
 And so I think if you can rightly frame that

2:14:03.060 --> 2:14:07.360
 between fretting about it every day and being afraid

2:14:07.360 --> 2:14:09.660
 and being so laissez faire that you think, you know,

2:14:09.660 --> 2:14:12.060
 you're gonna live forever,

2:14:13.240 --> 2:14:15.920
 it'll influence some of the decisions you make.

2:14:15.920 --> 2:14:19.140
 It'll influence the way you attack things

2:14:19.140 --> 2:14:23.420
 and hopefully the way that you live your life.

2:14:23.420 --> 2:14:28.180
 So yes, I wouldn't say I obsess over it

2:14:28.180 --> 2:14:30.400
 and I wouldn't say it's omnipresent,

2:14:31.700 --> 2:14:33.780
 but because I read a lot of stoicism

2:14:33.780 --> 2:14:36.940
 and just, I think it's right to pause and say,

2:14:37.780 --> 2:14:38.740
 who knows, right?

2:14:38.740 --> 2:14:41.300
 There's gonna be an expiration date.

2:14:42.340 --> 2:14:43.940
 And if it happened tomorrow,

2:14:43.940 --> 2:14:46.700
 have I done the things I wanted to do?

2:14:46.700 --> 2:14:50.120
 And am I the person I wanted to be?

2:14:50.120 --> 2:14:52.100
 And I think it's important along the way

2:14:52.100 --> 2:14:53.860
 to check those things.

2:14:53.860 --> 2:14:58.460
 Yeah, I try to make sure that I actually visualize this,

2:14:58.460 --> 2:15:01.340
 that I'm okay dying at the end of the day,

2:15:01.340 --> 2:15:03.100
 at the end of each day.

2:15:03.100 --> 2:15:05.500
 Like, if this is the last thing I do in my life

2:15:05.500 --> 2:15:07.760
 is talking to you.

2:15:07.760 --> 2:15:08.700
 Oh, good Lord.

2:15:11.260 --> 2:15:12.860
 I'm happy.

2:15:12.860 --> 2:15:15.140
 I know you're joking, but I, you know,

2:15:15.140 --> 2:15:19.620
 that, yeah, I'm happy I get to live the life I do

2:15:19.620 --> 2:15:20.740
 and I think momentum more,

2:15:20.740 --> 2:15:23.140
 I think the stoics have it right.

2:15:23.140 --> 2:15:26.380
 So you, and you have it right in saying,

2:15:26.380 --> 2:15:28.940
 meditate on death enough to remember

2:15:28.940 --> 2:15:31.500
 that this ride ends pretty quickly,

2:15:31.500 --> 2:15:34.340
 to help you appreciate every day

2:15:34.340 --> 2:15:36.500
 and the people you love, the people close to you

2:15:36.500 --> 2:15:39.280
 and the cool shit that you're doing in your life,

2:15:39.280 --> 2:15:40.860
 the cool shit you're creating.

2:15:40.860 --> 2:15:44.180
 And the fact that you, Mr. Thomas Tall,

2:15:44.180 --> 2:15:48.620
 are playing with the motherfucking Rolling Stones tomorrow.

2:15:48.620 --> 2:15:50.700
 You are the man in so many disciplines,

2:15:50.700 --> 2:15:52.940
 so respected, so successful.

2:15:52.940 --> 2:15:55.220
 It's truly an honor that you sit down

2:15:55.220 --> 2:15:56.460
 and talk with me today.

2:15:56.460 --> 2:15:59.780
 Thomas, thank you so much for showing up in Texas

2:15:59.780 --> 2:16:01.940
 and for talking on this silly little podcast.

2:16:01.940 --> 2:16:02.800
 Oh, it's great, man.

2:16:02.800 --> 2:16:04.300
 I'm a huge fan of the show

2:16:04.300 --> 2:16:06.700
 and have had a great time hanging with you

2:16:06.700 --> 2:16:09.260
 and really appreciate it.

2:16:09.260 --> 2:16:12.000

 And now, let me leave you with some words

2:16:18.320 --> 2:16:21.320
 from Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones.

2:16:21.320 --> 2:16:23.500
 You can't always get what you want,

2:16:23.500 --> 2:16:25.000
 but if you try sometimes,

2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:27.460
 you might find you'll get what you need.

2:16:27.460 --> 2:16:42.460
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
