00:00.000 --> 00:02.840
 The following is a conversation with Natalia Bailey,

00:02.840 --> 00:06.000
 a rocket scientist and spacecraft propulsion engineer

00:06.000 --> 00:09.540
 previously at MIT and now the founder and CTO

00:09.540 --> 00:11.160
 of Axion Systems,

00:11.160 --> 00:14.880
 specializing in efficient space propulsion engines

00:14.880 --> 00:16.840
 for satellites and spacecraft.

00:16.840 --> 00:19.360
 So these are not the engines that get us

00:19.360 --> 00:22.000
 from the ground on Earth out to space,

00:22.000 --> 00:25.600
 but rather the engines that move us around in space

00:25.600 --> 00:27.280
 once we get out there.

00:27.280 --> 00:29.120
 Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:29.120 --> 00:31.320
 Monk Pack Low Carb Snacks,

00:31.320 --> 00:33.360
 Four Sigmatic Mushroom Coffee,

00:33.360 --> 00:35.880
 Blinkist, an app that summarizes books,

00:35.880 --> 00:38.600
 and Sun Basket, meal delivery service.

00:38.600 --> 00:41.640
 So the choice is snacks, caffeine,

00:41.640 --> 00:44.120
 knowledge, or a delicious meal.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.400
 Choose wisely, my friends,

00:45.400 --> 00:48.120
 and if you wish, click the sponsor links below

00:51.320 --> 00:54.600
 As a side note, let me say something about Natalia's story.

00:54.600 --> 00:57.240
 She has talked about how when she was young,

00:57.240 --> 00:59.340
 she would often look up at the stars

00:59.340 --> 01:01.400
 and dream of alien intelligences

01:01.400 --> 01:03.840
 that one day we could communicate with.

01:03.840 --> 01:06.520
 This moment of childlike cosmic curiosity

01:06.520 --> 01:09.800
 is at the core of my own interest in space

01:09.800 --> 01:12.480
 and extraterrestrial life and in general

01:12.480 --> 01:15.600
 in artificial intelligence, science, and engineering.

01:15.600 --> 01:19.320
 Amid the meetings and the papers and the career rat race

01:19.320 --> 01:21.240
 and all the awards,

01:21.240 --> 01:24.680
 let's not let ourselves lose that childlike wonder.

01:24.680 --> 01:27.680
 Sadly, we're on Earth for only a very short time,

01:27.680 --> 01:30.040
 so let's have fun solving some of the biggest puzzles

01:30.040 --> 01:32.100
 in the universe while we're here.

01:32.100 --> 01:34.520

01:41.800 --> 01:45.460
 And now, here's my conversation with Natalia Bailey.

01:46.400 --> 01:49.840
 You said that you spent your whole life dreaming about space

01:49.840 --> 01:52.600
 and also pondering the big existential question

01:52.600 --> 01:56.760
 of whether there is or isn't intelligent life,

01:56.760 --> 01:58.640
 intelligent alien civilizations out there.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.080
 So what do you think?

02:00.080 --> 02:02.120
 Do you think there's life out there?

02:02.120 --> 02:03.560
 Intelligent life?

02:03.560 --> 02:07.360
 Intelligent life, that's trickier.

02:07.360 --> 02:11.120
 I think looking at the likelihood

02:11.120 --> 02:15.920
 of a self replicating organism

02:15.920 --> 02:20.440
 given how much time the universe has existed

02:20.440 --> 02:23.360
 and how many stars with planets,

02:23.360 --> 02:26.360
 I think it's likely that there's other life.

02:27.240 --> 02:30.400
 Intelligent life, I'm hopeful,

02:30.400 --> 02:34.420
 I'm a little discouraged that we haven't yet been in touch.

02:34.420 --> 02:35.260
 As I'm hopeful.

02:35.260 --> 02:37.000
 Allegedly, I mean, it's also.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.520
 In our dimensions and so on, yeah.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.180
 It's also possible that they have been in touch

02:42.180 --> 02:46.120
 and we just haven't, we're too dumb to realize

02:46.120 --> 02:47.480
 they're communicating with us.

02:47.480 --> 02:51.300
 In whichever, it's the Carl Sagan idea

02:51.300 --> 02:53.240
 that they may be communicating at a time scale

02:53.240 --> 02:54.580
 that's totally different.

02:54.580 --> 02:57.800
 Like their signals are in a totally different time scale

02:57.800 --> 03:01.900
 or in a totally different kind of medium of communication.

03:01.900 --> 03:06.900
 It could be our own, it could be the birth of human beings.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.380
 Whatever the magic that makes us who we are,

03:13.380 --> 03:15.440
 the collective intelligence thing,

03:15.440 --> 03:17.680
 that could be aliens themselves.

03:17.680 --> 03:19.540
 That could be the medium of communication.

03:19.540 --> 03:21.320
 Like the nature of our consciousness

03:21.320 --> 03:24.140
 and intelligence itself is the medium of communication.

03:24.140 --> 03:28.920
 And like being able to ask the questions themselves,

03:28.920 --> 03:30.480
 I've never thought of it that way.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.480
 Like actually, yeah, asking the question

03:32.480 --> 03:34.720
 whether aliens exist might be the very medium

03:34.720 --> 03:35.920
 by which they communicate.

03:35.920 --> 03:38.600
 It's like they send questions.

03:38.600 --> 03:42.720
 So some of this like collective emergent behavior

03:42.720 --> 03:44.480
 is the signal.

03:44.480 --> 03:45.780
 Is the signal, yeah.

03:46.640 --> 03:47.480
 So.

03:47.480 --> 03:48.760
 That's interesting, yeah.

03:48.760 --> 03:50.620
 Because maybe that's how we would communicate with,

03:50.620 --> 03:53.480
 if you think about it, if we were way, way, way smarter,

03:53.480 --> 03:56.400
 like a thousand years from now, we somehow survive,

03:56.400 --> 03:58.280
 like how would we actually communicate?

03:59.280 --> 04:03.220
 In a way that's like, if we broadcast the signal,

04:05.040 --> 04:07.660
 and then it could somehow like percolate

04:07.660 --> 04:09.080
 throughout the universe,

04:09.080 --> 04:10.920
 like that signal having an impact on.

04:10.920 --> 04:11.840
 Multiverse.

04:11.840 --> 04:16.840
 Multiverse, of course, that would have a signal,

04:16.960 --> 04:19.160
 an effect on the most possible,

04:19.160 --> 04:21.240
 the highest number of possible civilizations.

04:21.240 --> 04:22.520
 What would that signal be?

04:22.520 --> 04:24.960
 It might not be like sending a few

04:24.960 --> 04:28.160
 like stupid little hello world messages.

04:28.160 --> 04:31.300
 It might be something more impactful.

04:32.480 --> 04:36.280
 It's almost like impactful in a way

04:36.280 --> 04:40.200
 where they don't have to have the capability to hear it.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.760
 It like forces the message to have an impact.

04:42.760 --> 04:43.720
 Right.

04:43.720 --> 04:46.700
 My train of thought has never gone there,

04:46.700 --> 04:47.560
 but I like it.

04:47.560 --> 04:50.320
 And also somewhere in there,

04:50.320 --> 04:53.860
 I think it's implied that something travels faster

04:53.860 --> 04:58.080
 than the speed of light, which I'm also really hopeful for.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.480
 Oh, you're hopeful.

04:59.480 --> 05:01.700
 Are you excited by the possibility

05:01.700 --> 05:03.960
 that there's intelligent life out there?

05:03.960 --> 05:08.040
 Sort of, you work on the engineering side of things.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.880
 It's this very kind of focused pursuit

05:10.880 --> 05:15.800
 of moving things through space efficiently.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.480
 But if you zoom out,

05:18.480 --> 05:22.680
 one of the cool things that this enables us to do is find,

05:22.680 --> 05:23.720
 get even intelligent life,

05:23.720 --> 05:28.180
 just life on Mars or on Europa or something like that.

05:28.180 --> 05:29.640
 Does that excite you?

05:29.640 --> 05:30.800
 Does that scare you?

05:31.760 --> 05:32.920
 Oh, it's very exciting.

05:32.920 --> 05:36.840
 I mean, it's the whole reason I went into the field

05:36.840 --> 05:41.840
 I'm in is to contribute to building the body of knowledge

05:42.240 --> 05:46.200
 that we have as a species.

05:46.200 --> 05:47.480
 So very exciting.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.180
 Do you think there's life on Mars?

05:50.680 --> 05:54.360
 Like no longer, well, already living,

05:54.360 --> 05:57.300
 but currently living, but also no longer living,

05:57.300 --> 05:59.840
 like that we might be able to find life,

05:59.840 --> 06:03.560
 as some people suspect, basic microbial life.

06:03.560 --> 06:07.360
 I'm not so sure about in our own solar system.

06:07.360 --> 06:10.360
 And I do think it might be hard to untangle

06:10.360 --> 06:15.360
 if we somehow contaminated other things as well.

06:15.680 --> 06:19.160
 So I'm not sure about this close to home.

06:19.160 --> 06:20.540
 That'd be really exciting.

06:20.540 --> 06:21.380
 Yes.

06:21.380 --> 06:24.000
 Do you think about the Drake equation much of like?

06:24.000 --> 06:28.520
 That was what got me into all of this, yeah.

06:28.520 --> 06:31.520
 Yeah, because one of the questions is how hard is it

06:31.520 --> 06:34.280
 for life to start on a habitable planet?

06:34.280 --> 06:36.280
 Like if you have a lot of the basic conditions,

06:36.280 --> 06:39.860
 not exactly like Earth, but basic Earth like conditions,

06:39.860 --> 06:41.440
 how hard is it for life to start?

06:41.440 --> 06:44.960
 And if you find life on Mars or find life on Europa,

06:46.200 --> 06:48.560
 that means it's way easier.

06:48.560 --> 06:49.960
 That's a good thing to confirm

06:49.960 --> 06:52.540
 that if you have a habitable planet,

06:53.760 --> 06:55.560
 then there's going to be life.

06:55.560 --> 06:58.840
 And that like immediately, that would be super exciting

06:58.840 --> 07:02.680
 because that means there's like trillions of planets

07:02.680 --> 07:04.640
 with basic life out there.

07:04.640 --> 07:07.360
 Though of all the planets in our solar system,

07:07.360 --> 07:09.400
 Earth is clearly the most habitable.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.440
 So I would not be discouraged

07:12.440 --> 07:17.040
 if we didn't find it on another planet in our solar system.

07:17.040 --> 07:19.080
 True, and again, that life could look very different.

07:19.080 --> 07:21.040
 It's habitable for Earth like life,

07:21.040 --> 07:23.560
 but it could be totally different.

07:23.560 --> 07:25.880
 I still think that trees are quite possibly

07:25.880 --> 07:27.400
 more intelligent than humans,

07:27.400 --> 07:31.280
 but their intelligence is carried out over a time scale

07:31.280 --> 07:33.040
 that we're just not able to appreciate.

07:33.040 --> 07:34.120
 Like they might be running

07:34.120 --> 07:36.280
 the entirety of human civilization,

07:36.280 --> 07:38.600
 and we're just like too dumb to realize

07:38.600 --> 07:40.340
 that they're the smart ones.

07:40.340 --> 07:43.720
 Maybe that's the alien message.

07:43.720 --> 07:44.760
 It's in the trees.

07:44.760 --> 07:46.480
 It's in the trees.

07:47.720 --> 07:50.400
 Yeah, it's not in the monolith in the Utah desert.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.240
 It's in the trees.

07:51.240 --> 07:52.680
 Right, yeah.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.080
 So let's go to space exploration.

07:55.080 --> 07:57.200
 How do you think we would get humans to Mars?

07:57.200 --> 08:01.320
 I think SpaceX and Elon Musk will be the ones

08:01.320 --> 08:05.920
 that get the first human setting foot on Mars,

08:06.920 --> 08:10.080
 and probably not that long from now

08:10.080 --> 08:12.640
 from us having this conversation.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.920
 Maybe we'll inflate his timeline a little bit,

08:14.920 --> 08:19.160
 but I tend to believe the goals he sets.

08:19.160 --> 08:22.320
 So I think that will happen relatively soon.

08:22.320 --> 08:25.040
 As far as when and what it will take

08:25.040 --> 08:28.800
 to get humans living there in a more permanent way,

08:30.840 --> 08:34.720
 I have a glib answer, which is when we can invent

08:34.720 --> 08:38.600
 a time machine to go back to the early Cold War,

08:38.600 --> 08:43.240
 and instead of uniting around sending people to the moon,

08:43.240 --> 08:45.760
 we pick Mars as the destination.

08:45.760 --> 08:48.920
 So really, I say that because there's nothing

08:49.920 --> 08:54.640
 truly scientifically or technologically impossible

08:54.640 --> 08:57.720
 about doing that soon.

08:57.720 --> 09:00.960
 It's more politically and financially,

09:00.960 --> 09:04.480
 and those are the obstacles, I think, to that.

09:04.480 --> 09:07.120
 Well, I wonder of when you colonize

09:07.120 --> 09:10.760
 with more than, I say, five people on Mars,

09:10.760 --> 09:14.960
 you have to start thinking about the kind of rules

09:14.960 --> 09:18.520
 you have on Mars, and just speaking of the Cold War,

09:18.520 --> 09:21.840
 who gets to own the land?

09:21.840 --> 09:23.760
 You know, you start planting flags,

09:23.760 --> 09:25.760
 and you start to make decisions.

09:25.760 --> 09:30.120
 And like SpaceX says, it's probably a little bit trolly,

09:30.120 --> 09:34.360
 but they have this nice paragraph in their contracts

09:34.360 --> 09:39.360
 where it talks about that human governments on Earth

09:41.760 --> 09:46.760
 or Earth governments have no jurisdiction on Mars.

09:46.760 --> 09:50.280
 Like the rules, the Martians get to define their own rules.

09:50.280 --> 09:53.920
 It sounds very much like the founding fathers

09:53.920 --> 09:54.840
 for this country.

09:54.840 --> 09:56.240
 That's the kind of language.

09:57.360 --> 10:02.120
 It's interesting that that's in there,

10:02.120 --> 10:07.120
 and it makes you think perhaps that needs to be leveraged.

10:07.360 --> 10:10.040
 Like you have to be very clever about leveraging that

10:10.040 --> 10:14.800
 to create a little bit of a Cold War feeling.

10:14.800 --> 10:18.960
 It seems like we humans need a little bit of a competition.

10:18.960 --> 10:21.200
 Do you think that's necessary to succeed

10:21.200 --> 10:25.480
 and to get the necessary investment,

10:25.480 --> 10:28.840
 or can the pure pursuit of science be enough?

10:28.840 --> 10:30.920
 No, I think we're seeing right now

10:30.920 --> 10:33.440
 the pure pursuit of science.

10:33.440 --> 10:38.440
 I mean, that results in pretty tiny budgets for exploration.

10:39.360 --> 10:43.920
 There has to be some disaster impending doom

10:43.920 --> 10:48.280
 to get us onto another planet in a permanent way.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.840
 I don't know, financially, I just don't know

10:50.840 --> 10:54.120
 if the private sector can support that,

10:55.000 --> 10:59.800
 but I don't wish that there is some catastrophe

10:59.800 --> 11:03.840
 coming our way that spurs us to do that.

11:03.840 --> 11:05.960
 Yeah, I'm unsure what the business model is

11:05.960 --> 11:07.960
 for colonizing Mars.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.160
 Yeah, exactly.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.320
 Yeah, like there is for, we'll talk about satellites.

11:11.320 --> 11:14.800
 There's probably a lot of business models around satellites,

11:14.800 --> 11:18.160
 but there's not enough short term business.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.520
 I guess that's how business works.

11:19.520 --> 11:23.000
 Like you should have a path to making money

11:23.000 --> 11:25.120
 in like the next 10 years.

11:25.120 --> 11:29.720
 Well, and maybe even more broadly,

11:29.720 --> 11:33.400
 and looping back to something we said earlier,

11:33.400 --> 11:37.860
 I don't know that getting humans off this planet

11:37.860 --> 11:42.040
 and spreading like bacteria

11:42.040 --> 11:45.480
 is what we're supposed to be doing in the first place.

11:45.480 --> 11:49.000
 So maybe we can go, but should we?

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
 And I'm probably an unusual person

11:54.360 --> 11:56.280
 for thinking that in my industry

11:56.280 --> 11:59.380
 because humans want to explore,

11:59.380 --> 12:03.880
 but I almost wonder, are we putting unnecessary obstacles?

12:03.880 --> 12:07.480
 Like we're very finicky biological things

12:07.480 --> 12:12.120
 in the way of some more robotic or more

12:12.120 --> 12:15.240
 silicon based exploration.

12:15.240 --> 12:19.040
 And yeah, do we need to colonize and spread?

12:19.040 --> 12:20.360
 I'm not sure.

12:20.360 --> 12:22.900
 What do you think is the role of AI in space?

12:22.900 --> 12:25.640
 Do you, in your work, again, we'll talk about it,

12:25.640 --> 12:30.640
 but do you see more and more of the space vehicles,

12:32.320 --> 12:37.320
 spacecraft being run by artificial intelligence systems?

12:37.320 --> 12:39.120
 More than just like the flight control,

12:39.120 --> 12:41.000
 but like the management?

12:41.000 --> 12:43.880
 Yeah, I don't have a lot of color to the dreams

12:43.880 --> 12:46.200
 I have about way in the future in AI,

12:46.200 --> 12:51.200
 but I do think that removing,

12:51.840 --> 12:54.760
 it's hard for humans to even make a trip to Mars,

12:54.760 --> 12:58.060
 much less go anywhere farther than that.

12:58.060 --> 13:01.680
 And I think we'll have more,

13:03.400 --> 13:05.940
 again, I'm probably unusual in having these thoughts,

13:05.940 --> 13:09.440
 but perhaps be able to generate more knowledge

13:09.440 --> 13:13.000
 and understand more if we stop trying to send humans

13:13.000 --> 13:17.780
 and instead, I don't know if we're talking about AI

13:17.780 --> 13:20.700
 in a truly artificial intelligence way

13:20.700 --> 13:23.840
 or AI as we kind of use it today,

13:23.840 --> 13:28.840
 but maybe sending a Petri dish or two of like stem cells

13:29.040 --> 13:32.000
 and some robotic handlers instead,

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
 if we still need to send our DNA

13:34.000 --> 13:36.060
 because we're really stuck on that,

13:36.060 --> 13:40.020
 but if not, maybe not even that Petri dish.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.440
 So I see, I think what I'm saying is,

13:42.440 --> 13:44.800
 I see a much bigger role in the future

13:44.800 --> 13:47.080
 of AI for space exploration.

13:47.080 --> 13:50.080
 It's kind of sad to think that,

13:50.080 --> 13:53.680
 I mean, I'm sure we'll eventually send a spacecraft

13:53.680 --> 13:55.600
 with efficient propulsion,

13:55.600 --> 13:57.920
 like some of the stuff you work on out

13:57.920 --> 14:00.680
 that travels just really far with some robots on it

14:00.680 --> 14:05.000
 and with some DNA in a Petri dish,

14:05.000 --> 14:08.640
 and then human civilization destroys itself,

14:08.640 --> 14:11.280
 and then there'll just be this floating spacecraft

14:11.280 --> 14:13.920
 that eventually gets somewhere or not.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.560
 That's a sad thought, like this lonely spacecraft

14:16.560 --> 14:18.620
 just kind of traveling through space

14:18.620 --> 14:20.600
 and humans are all dead.

14:20.600 --> 14:25.600
 Well, it depends on what the goal is, right?

14:27.200 --> 14:29.640
 Another way to look at it is we've preserved,

14:29.640 --> 14:33.000
 it's like a little time capsule of knowledge, DNA,

14:33.000 --> 14:36.400
 that will outlive us.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.240
 Well, that's beautiful.

14:37.240 --> 14:38.060
 Yeah.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.400
 It's how I sleep at night.

14:41.400 --> 14:43.760
 So you also mentioned that you wanted to be an astronaut.

14:43.760 --> 14:44.600
 Yes.

14:45.560 --> 14:47.480
 So even though you said you're unusual

14:47.480 --> 14:50.840
 in thinking like, it's nice here on Earth,

14:50.840 --> 14:53.880
 and then we might want to be sending robots up there,

14:53.880 --> 14:57.140
 you wanted to be a human that goes out there.

14:57.140 --> 15:00.700
 Would you like to one day travel to Mars?

15:01.580 --> 15:04.860
 You know, if it becomes sort of more open

15:04.860 --> 15:07.340
 to civilian travel and that kind of thing?

15:07.340 --> 15:09.980
 Like are you, like vacation wise,

15:09.980 --> 15:12.480
 like if we're talking vacations,

15:12.480 --> 15:15.420
 would you like to vacation on Earth or vacation on Mars?

15:15.420 --> 15:20.260
 I wish that I had a better answer, but no.

15:20.260 --> 15:23.580
 I wanted to be an astronaut because I,

15:23.580 --> 15:28.480
 first of all, I like working in labs and doing experiments.

15:28.480 --> 15:33.480
 And I wanted to go to like the coolest lab, the ISS,

15:34.220 --> 15:37.020
 and do some experiments there.

15:37.020 --> 15:39.660
 That's being decommissioned, which is sad,

15:39.660 --> 15:42.260
 but you know, there will be others, I'm sure.

15:43.380 --> 15:44.660
 The ISS is being decommissioned?

15:44.660 --> 15:49.380
 Yes, I think by 2025, it's not going to be in use anymore.

15:49.380 --> 15:51.000
 But I think there are other,

15:51.000 --> 15:54.120
 there are private companies that are going to be putting up

15:54.120 --> 15:55.320
 stations and things.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.260
 So it's primarily like a research lab, essentially.

15:57.260 --> 15:58.100
 Yes.

15:58.100 --> 15:59.860
 A research lab in space, that's a cool way to say it.

15:59.860 --> 16:02.420
 It's like the coolest possible research lobby.

16:02.420 --> 16:03.700
 That's where I wanted to go.

16:03.700 --> 16:08.700
 And now though, my risk profile has changed a little bit.

16:08.980 --> 16:13.980
 I have three little ones and I won't be in the first

16:15.880 --> 16:18.660
 thousand people to go to Mars, let's put it that way.

16:18.660 --> 16:20.420
 Yeah, Earth is kind of nice.

16:20.420 --> 16:23.980
 We have our troubles, but overall, it's pretty nice.

16:23.980 --> 16:25.980
 Again, it's the Netflix.

16:25.980 --> 16:28.540
 Okay, let's talk rockets.

16:28.540 --> 16:31.940
 How does a rocket engine work or any kind of engine

16:31.940 --> 16:36.820
 that can get us to space or float around in space?

16:36.820 --> 16:40.500
 The basic principle is conservation of momentum.

16:40.500 --> 16:45.500
 So you throw stuff out the back of the engine

16:47.460 --> 16:50.060
 and that pushes the rocket and the spacecraft

16:50.060 --> 16:51.020
 in the other direction.

16:51.020 --> 16:56.020
 So there are two main types of rocket propulsion.

16:57.900 --> 17:00.780
 The one people are more familiar with is chemical

17:00.780 --> 17:03.460
 because it's loud and there's fire.

17:04.500 --> 17:08.140
 And that's what's used for launch and is more televised.

17:08.140 --> 17:12.700
 So in those types of systems, you usually have a fuel

17:12.700 --> 17:15.920
 on an oxidizer and they react and combust

17:15.920 --> 17:18.660
 and release stored chemical energy.

17:18.660 --> 17:23.620
 And that energy heats the resultant gas

17:23.620 --> 17:26.780
 and that's funneled out the back through a nozzle,

17:26.780 --> 17:30.780
 directed out the back and then that momentum exchange

17:30.780 --> 17:32.380
 pushes the spacecraft forward.

17:32.380 --> 17:34.020
 Is there an interesting difference in liquid

17:34.020 --> 17:36.740
 and solid fuel in those contexts?

17:36.740 --> 17:38.700
 They're both lumped in the same.

17:38.700 --> 17:43.100
 So chemical just means that the release of energy

17:43.100 --> 17:45.680
 from those bonds essentially.

17:45.680 --> 17:48.700
 So a solid fuel works the same way.

17:48.700 --> 17:52.780
 And the other main category is electric propulsion.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.500
 So instead of chemical energy,

17:54.500 --> 17:56.820
 you're using electrical energy,

17:56.820 --> 18:00.660
 usually from batteries or solar panels.

18:00.660 --> 18:05.660
 And in this case, the stuff you're pushing out the back

18:05.940 --> 18:07.740
 would be charged particles.

18:07.740 --> 18:11.500
 So instead of combustion and heat,

18:11.500 --> 18:13.820
 you end up with charged particles

18:13.820 --> 18:16.220
 and you force them out the back of the spacecraft

18:16.220 --> 18:20.180
 using either an electrostatic field or electromagnetic.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.620
 But it's the same momentum exchange

18:23.620 --> 18:25.460
 and same idea stuff out the back

18:25.460 --> 18:27.820
 and everything else goes forward.

18:27.820 --> 18:30.200
 Cool, so those are the big two categories.

18:30.200 --> 18:35.200
 What's the difference maybe in the challenges of each,

18:35.200 --> 18:40.200
 in the challenges of each, the use cases of each

18:41.480 --> 18:45.000
 and how they're used today, the physics of each

18:45.880 --> 18:48.280
 and where they're used, all that kind of stuff.

18:48.280 --> 18:49.960
 Anything interesting about the two categories

18:49.960 --> 18:51.520
 that distinguishes them?

18:51.520 --> 18:56.520
 Besides the chemical one being the big sexy flames.

18:56.720 --> 18:57.800
 Yeah, fire.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.680
 Fire, yeah.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.280
 Chemical is very well understood

19:02.280 --> 19:06.980
 in its simplest form, it's like a firework.

19:06.980 --> 19:11.080
 So it's been around since 400 BC or something like that.

19:12.080 --> 19:15.040
 So that even the big engines are quite well understood.

19:15.040 --> 19:20.040
 I think one of the last gaps there is probably

19:23.640 --> 19:27.400
 what exactly are the products of combustion?

19:27.400 --> 19:32.400
 Our modeling abilities kind of fall apart there

19:32.520 --> 19:35.560
 because it's hot and gases are moving

19:35.560 --> 19:40.560
 and you end up kind of having to venture

19:41.200 --> 19:46.200
 into lots of different interdisciplinary fields of science

19:46.840 --> 19:47.720
 to try to solve that.

19:47.720 --> 19:51.920
 And that's quite complex, but we have pretty good models

19:51.920 --> 19:54.120
 for some of the more like emergent behaviors

19:54.120 --> 19:55.200
 of that system anyways.

19:55.200 --> 20:00.200
 But that's I think one of the last unsolved pieces.

20:00.640 --> 20:04.760
 And really the kind of what people care about there

20:04.760 --> 20:07.760
 is making it more fuel efficient.

20:07.760 --> 20:11.660
 So the chemical stuff, you can get a lot

20:11.660 --> 20:15.360
 of instantaneous thrusts, but it's not very fuel efficient.

20:15.360 --> 20:16.880
 It's much more fuel efficient to go

20:16.880 --> 20:19.980
 with the electric type of propulsion.

20:19.980 --> 20:23.260
 So that's where people spend a lot of their time

20:23.260 --> 20:25.280
 is trying to make that more efficient in terms

20:25.280 --> 20:28.320
 of thrust per unit of fuel.

20:28.320 --> 20:31.860
 And then there's always considerations

20:31.860 --> 20:33.700
 like heating and cooling.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.360
 It's very hot, which is good if it heats the gases,

20:36.360 --> 20:40.680
 but bad if it melts the rocket and things like that.

20:40.680 --> 20:42.080
 So there's always a lot of work on heating

20:42.080 --> 20:45.340
 and cooling and the engine cycles and things like that.

20:46.520 --> 20:48.680
 And then on electric propulsion,

20:48.680 --> 20:53.680
 I find it like much more refreshingly poorly understood.

20:56.040 --> 20:57.240
 Lots more mysteries.

20:57.240 --> 20:58.800
 Yeah, I think so.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.920
 One of the classes I took in college,

21:03.080 --> 21:06.120
 we spent 90% of the class on chemical propulsion

21:06.120 --> 21:07.920
 and then the last 10% on electric.

21:07.920 --> 21:09.520
 And the professor said like,

21:09.520 --> 21:12.280
 we only sort of understand how it works,

21:12.280 --> 21:13.880
 but it works kind of.

21:13.880 --> 21:16.880
 And it's like, that's interesting.

21:16.880 --> 21:20.120
 Yeah, and even an ion engine,

21:20.120 --> 21:22.800
 which is probably one of the most straightforward

21:22.800 --> 21:27.500
 because it's just an electrostatic engine,

21:27.500 --> 21:29.900
 but it has this really awesome combination

21:29.900 --> 21:34.160
 of like quantum mechanics and material science

21:34.160 --> 21:38.560
 and fluid dynamics and electrostatics.

21:38.560 --> 21:41.520
 And it's just very intriguing to me.

21:42.440 --> 21:44.760
 First of all, can you actually zoom out even more?

21:44.760 --> 21:47.960
 Like, cause you mentioned ion propulsion engine

21:47.960 --> 21:51.040
 is a subset of electric.

21:51.040 --> 21:53.520
 So like maybe, is there a categories of electric engines

21:53.520 --> 21:55.760
 and then we can zoom in on ion propulsion?

21:55.760 --> 21:57.720
 Yes, so sure.

21:57.720 --> 22:01.520
 There's the two most kind of conventional types

22:01.520 --> 22:03.680
 that have been around since the sixties

22:03.680 --> 22:06.800
 are ion engines and hall thrusters.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.840
 And ion engines are a little bit simpler

22:08.840 --> 22:11.480
 because they don't use a magnetic field

22:11.480 --> 22:12.880
 for generating thrust.

22:12.880 --> 22:17.880
 And then there are also some other types of plasma engines,

22:20.000 --> 22:21.960
 but that don't fit into those two categories.

22:21.960 --> 22:23.640
 So just kind of other plasma,

22:23.640 --> 22:27.600
 like a VASMIR engine, which we could get into.

22:28.640 --> 22:32.640
 And then those are probably the main three categories

22:32.640 --> 22:33.800
 that would be fun to talk about.

22:33.800 --> 22:36.480
 Oh, and then of course, the category of engine

22:36.480 --> 22:39.400
 that I work on, which has a lot of similarities

22:39.400 --> 22:42.600
 to an ion engine, but could be considered its own class

22:42.600 --> 22:44.560
 called a colloid thruster.

22:44.560 --> 22:45.560
 Colloid, cool.

22:45.560 --> 22:48.960
 Okay, so what is an ion propulsion, I imagine?

22:48.960 --> 22:53.960
 Okay, so in an ion engine, you have an ionization chamber

22:54.320 --> 22:57.640
 and you inject the propellant into that chamber.

22:57.640 --> 23:02.640
 And this is usually a neutral gas like xenon or argon.

23:03.640 --> 23:05.000
 So you inject that into the chamber

23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
 and you also inject a stream of really high energy electrons

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
 and everything's just moving around very randomly in there.

23:16.680 --> 23:21.320
 And the whole goal is to have one of those electrons

23:21.320 --> 23:24.200
 collide with one of those neutral atoms

23:24.200 --> 23:26.000
 and turn it into an ion.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.400
 So kick off a secondary electron and now you have...

23:29.400 --> 23:30.240
 Plasma.

23:30.240 --> 23:31.060
 Yes.

23:31.060 --> 23:31.900
 Okay.

23:31.900 --> 23:36.900
 And now you have a charged xenon or argon ion

23:36.900 --> 23:39.020
 and more electrons and so on.

23:39.020 --> 23:44.020
 And then some fraction of those ions will happen

23:44.020 --> 23:47.620
 to make it to this downstream electric field

23:47.620 --> 23:50.860
 that we set up between two grids with holes in them.

23:50.860 --> 23:55.220
 And in terms of area, the same amount of those ions

23:55.220 --> 23:58.740
 also runs into the walls and lose their charge

23:58.740 --> 24:01.420
 and that's where some of the inefficiencies come in.

24:01.420 --> 24:05.420
 But the very lucky few make it to the downstream

24:05.420 --> 24:09.540
 and the very lucky few make it to those holes in that grid

24:09.540 --> 24:11.740
 and there are two grids actually

24:11.740 --> 24:14.980
 and you apply a voltage differential between them

24:14.980 --> 24:17.700
 and that sets up an electric field.

24:17.700 --> 24:20.580
 And a charged particle in an electric field

24:20.580 --> 24:21.780
 creates a force.

24:21.780 --> 24:25.460
 And so those ions are accelerated out the back of the engine

24:25.460 --> 24:30.460
 and the reaction force is what pushes the spacecraft forward.

24:30.460 --> 24:35.460
 If you're following along and tallying these charges,

24:35.540 --> 24:39.740
 now we've just sent a positive beam of ions

24:39.740 --> 24:44.020
 out the back of the spacecraft and for our purposes here,

24:44.020 --> 24:45.700
 the spacecraft is neutral.

24:45.700 --> 24:48.980
 So eventually those ions will come back

24:48.980 --> 24:51.560
 and hit the spacecraft because it's a positive beam.

24:51.560 --> 24:56.300
 So you also have to have an external cathode producer

24:56.300 --> 24:58.820
 of electrons outside the engine

24:58.820 --> 25:02.300
 that pumps electrons into that beam and neutralizes that.

25:02.300 --> 25:03.980
 So now it's net neutral everywhere

25:03.980 --> 25:05.300
 and it won't come back to the spacecraft.

25:05.300 --> 25:07.780
 So that's an ion engine.

25:07.780 --> 25:09.780
 What temperature are we talking about here?

25:09.780 --> 25:13.060
 So in terms of like the chemical based engines,

25:13.060 --> 25:14.860
 those are super hot.

25:14.860 --> 25:16.740
 You mentioned plasma here.

25:16.740 --> 25:18.140
 How hot does this thing get?

25:20.020 --> 25:22.140
 I mean, is that an interesting thing to talk about

25:22.140 --> 25:25.260
 in a sense that is that an interesting distinction

25:25.260 --> 25:28.300
 or is the heat, I mean, it's all gonna be hot.

25:28.300 --> 25:31.020
 No, so it's important especially

25:31.020 --> 25:32.820
 for some of these smaller satellites

25:32.820 --> 25:35.300
 people are into launching these days.

25:35.300 --> 25:39.260
 So it's important because you have the plasma

25:39.260 --> 25:42.380
 but also those high energy electrons are hot

25:42.380 --> 25:46.620
 and if you have a lot of those that are going into the walls

25:46.620 --> 25:48.200
 you do have to care about the temperature.

25:48.200 --> 25:52.540
 So I'm having trouble remembering off the top of my head.

25:52.540 --> 25:54.960
 I think they're at like a hundred electron volts

25:54.960 --> 25:56.820
 in terms of the electron energy

25:56.820 --> 25:59.620
 and then I'd have to remember how to convert that

25:59.620 --> 26:00.700
 into Kelvin.

26:00.700 --> 26:02.620
 Can you stick your hand in it?

26:02.620 --> 26:03.660
 Not move the temperature.

26:03.660 --> 26:05.660
 Not recommended, yeah.

26:05.660 --> 26:07.700
 So what's a colloid engine?

26:07.700 --> 26:12.700
 So the same rocket people that came up with these ideas

26:16.180 --> 26:19.540
 for electric propulsion probably in the middle

26:19.540 --> 26:24.540
 of last century also realized that there's one more place

26:24.540 --> 26:28.940
 to get charged particles from if you're going

26:28.940 --> 26:30.340
 to be using electric propulsion.

26:30.340 --> 26:33.220
 So you can take a gas and you can ionize it

26:33.220 --> 26:37.500
 but there are also some liquids particularly ionic liquids

26:37.500 --> 26:41.020
 which is what we use that you also can use

26:41.020 --> 26:43.740
 as a source of ions and if you have ions

26:43.740 --> 26:45.580
 and you put them in a field you generate a force.

26:45.580 --> 26:50.580
 So they recognize that but part of being able

26:51.220 --> 26:53.380
 to leverage that technique is being able

26:53.380 --> 26:57.340
 to kind of manipulate those liquids on a scale

26:57.340 --> 27:01.260
 of nanometers or very few microns.

27:01.260 --> 27:05.320
 So the diameter of a human hair or something like that

27:05.320 --> 27:08.660
 and in the 50s there was no way to do that.

27:08.660 --> 27:10.500
 So they wrote about it in some books

27:10.500 --> 27:12.900
 and then it kind of died for a little bit

27:12.900 --> 27:17.900
 and then with silicon mems, computer processors

27:17.940 --> 27:21.460
 and when foundry started becoming more ubiquitous

27:21.460 --> 27:26.460
 and my advisor started at MIT kind of put those ideas

27:28.340 --> 27:31.680
 back together and was like, hey actually there's now a way

27:31.680 --> 27:35.080
 to build this and bring this other technique to life.

27:36.160 --> 27:40.880
 And so the way that you actually get the ions

27:40.880 --> 27:43.980
 out of those liquids is you put the liquid

27:43.980 --> 27:47.220
 in again a strong electric field

27:47.220 --> 27:50.220
 and the electric field stresses the liquid

27:50.220 --> 27:51.800
 and you keep increasing the field

27:51.800 --> 27:56.800
 and eventually the liquid will assume a conical shape.

27:57.060 --> 28:01.200
 It's when the electric field pressure that's pulling on it

28:01.200 --> 28:04.740
 exactly balances the liquid's own restoring force

28:04.740 --> 28:06.900
 which is its surface tension.

28:06.900 --> 28:10.080
 So you have this balance and the liquid assumes a cone

28:10.080 --> 28:12.400
 when it's perfectly balanced like that

28:12.400 --> 28:16.340
 and at the tip of a cone the radius of curvature

28:16.340 --> 28:18.500
 goes to zero right at the tip

28:18.500 --> 28:23.500
 and the electric field right at the tip of a sharp object

28:24.540 --> 28:29.540
 would go to infinity because it goes as one over the radius

28:31.200 --> 28:33.180
 and one over the radius squared

28:33.180 --> 28:37.420
 and instead of the electric field going to infinity

28:37.420 --> 28:40.940
 and maybe like generating a wormhole or something,

28:40.940 --> 28:44.260
 a jet of ions instead starts issuing

28:44.260 --> 28:46.220
 from the tip of that liquid.

28:46.220 --> 28:47.740
 So the field becomes strong enough there

28:47.740 --> 28:50.460
 that you can pull ions out of the liquid.

28:50.460 --> 28:51.620
 What is the liquid?

28:51.620 --> 28:54.580
 We're talking about, there's a bunch of different ones.

28:54.580 --> 28:58.460
 You can do it with different types of liquids.

28:58.460 --> 29:02.020
 It depends on how easily you can free ions

29:02.020 --> 29:06.480
 from their neighbors and if it has enough surface tension

29:06.480 --> 29:09.040
 so that you can build up a high enough electric field

29:09.040 --> 29:12.340
 but what we use are called ionic liquids

29:12.340 --> 29:13.960
 and they're really just positive.

29:13.960 --> 29:17.100
 They're very similar to salts but they happen to be liquid

29:17.100 --> 29:19.380
 over a really wide range of temperatures.

29:19.380 --> 29:21.540
 This sounds like really cool.

29:21.540 --> 29:25.140
 Okay, so how big is the cone we're talking about?

29:25.140 --> 29:27.620
 What's the size of this cone that generates the ions?

29:27.620 --> 29:30.520
 So if you have a cone that's emitting pure ions,

29:33.100 --> 29:35.100
 I can't remember if it's the radius or diameter

29:35.100 --> 29:39.140
 but that emission is happening from,

29:39.140 --> 29:41.820
 of that cone is something like 20 nanometers.

29:41.820 --> 29:45.340
 Oh, I was imagining something slightly bigger

29:45.340 --> 29:49.220
 but so like this is tiny, tiny.

29:49.220 --> 29:52.100
 Hence the only being able to do it recently.

29:52.100 --> 29:52.940
 Yeah, that's right.

29:52.940 --> 29:55.700
 So this is all controlled by a computer, I guess.

29:55.700 --> 30:00.460
 Like, or like, how do you create a cone

30:00.460 --> 30:04.020
 that generates ions at a scale of nanometers exactly?

30:04.020 --> 30:08.460
 So the kind of main trick to making this work

30:08.460 --> 30:12.620
 is that physically we manufacture hundreds

30:12.620 --> 30:16.320
 or thousands of sharp structures and then supply the liquid

30:16.320 --> 30:17.160
 to the tips.

30:17.160 --> 30:20.220
 So that does a few things.

30:20.220 --> 30:23.020
 It makes sure that we know where the ion beams are forming.

30:23.020 --> 30:25.260
 So we can put holes in the grid above them

30:25.260 --> 30:27.940
 to let them actually leave instead of hitting, right?

30:27.940 --> 30:29.380
 Cool.

30:29.380 --> 30:32.980
 But it also reduces the actual field we have,

30:32.980 --> 30:35.280
 the voltage we have to apply to create that field

30:35.280 --> 30:36.780
 because the field will be much stronger

30:36.780 --> 30:41.780
 if we can already give the liquid a tip to form on.

30:41.780 --> 30:45.260
 And those tips we form have radii of curvature

30:46.380 --> 30:50.900
 on the order of probably like single microns.

30:50.900 --> 30:53.440
 So we are working at a little bit larger scale

30:53.440 --> 30:55.660
 but once we create that support

30:55.660 --> 30:57.940
 and the electric field can be focused at that tip,

30:57.940 --> 31:00.100
 then the tiny little cone can form on top of that.

31:00.100 --> 31:01.980
 So wait, so there's something in them,

31:01.980 --> 31:04.680
 there's already like a hard material

31:04.680 --> 31:07.140
 that like gives you the base for the cone

31:07.140 --> 31:08.700
 and then you're pouring like liquid over it,

31:08.700 --> 31:10.140
 whatever the heck. From the bottom, yeah.

31:10.140 --> 31:12.020
 It's porous, so we actually supply it

31:12.020 --> 31:13.540
 from the back of the chip and then it wicks.

31:13.540 --> 31:17.020
 And then liquid forms on top on that structure.

31:17.020 --> 31:20.540
 And then you somehow make it like super sharp, the liquid,

31:20.540 --> 31:22.500
 so the ions can leave.

31:24.860 --> 31:28.500
 And then we've applied that field to get those ions

31:28.500 --> 31:31.620
 and that same field then accelerates them.

31:31.620 --> 31:33.940
 That's awesome. And there's like a bunch of these?

31:33.940 --> 31:37.460
 Yeah, I should have brought something.

31:37.460 --> 31:38.740
 So we...

31:38.740 --> 31:41.260
 You could just pretend that you have some nanometer cones

31:41.260 --> 31:42.100
 on a table here.

31:42.100 --> 31:44.980
 So actually, you know, kind of about this scale,

31:44.980 --> 31:47.620
 we build, we call them thruster chips

31:47.620 --> 31:49.980
 and it's just a convenient form factor

31:49.980 --> 31:51.820
 and it's a square centimeter.

31:51.820 --> 31:53.740
 And on each square centimeter today,

31:53.740 --> 31:56.700
 we have about 500 of the actual physical,

31:56.700 --> 31:59.420
 we call them emitters, those physical cones.

32:00.500 --> 32:04.500
 And we're working on increasing that by a factor of four

32:04.500 --> 32:05.660
 in the coming months.

32:05.660 --> 32:07.260
 In size or in the density?

32:07.260 --> 32:10.340
 In number, in the density, the number of emitters

32:10.340 --> 32:12.300
 within the same square centimeter chip.

32:12.300 --> 32:14.380
 So that thing, cause I think I've seen pictures of you

32:14.380 --> 32:15.820
 with like a tiny thing in your hand.

32:15.820 --> 32:17.300
 That must be the...

32:17.300 --> 32:19.860
 Okay, so that's an engine.

32:19.860 --> 32:24.380
 So that is kind of the ionization chamber

32:24.380 --> 32:26.100
 and thrust producing part of it.

32:26.100 --> 32:28.900
 What's not shown, you know, in that picture

32:29.860 --> 32:31.740
 is the propellant tank.

32:31.740 --> 32:34.380
 So we can keep supplying more and more of the liquid

32:34.380 --> 32:36.740
 to those emission sites.

32:36.740 --> 32:40.540
 And then we also provide a power electronic system

32:40.540 --> 32:41.820
 that talks to the spacecraft

32:41.820 --> 32:43.820
 and turns our device on and off.

32:43.820 --> 32:45.740
 So that's the colloid engine.

32:45.740 --> 32:47.620
 That's the core of the colloid engine.

32:47.620 --> 32:50.380
 It's, the way I've been talking about it,

32:50.380 --> 32:53.940
 it's more of ion electrospray colloid

32:55.580 --> 33:00.500
 tends to mean like liquid droplets coming off of the jet.

33:00.500 --> 33:03.380
 But if you make smaller and smaller cones,

33:03.380 --> 33:04.820
 you get pure ions.

33:04.820 --> 33:07.460
 So we're kind of like a subset of colloid, yes.

33:07.460 --> 33:10.700
 What aspects of this, you said that it's been full

33:10.700 --> 33:13.260
 of mysteries from the physics perspective.

33:13.260 --> 33:15.820
 What aspects of this are understood

33:15.820 --> 33:19.660
 and what are still full of mystery?

33:19.660 --> 33:24.660
 Yeah, recently we've been understanding

33:24.740 --> 33:29.740
 the kind of instabilities and stable regimes of,

33:30.660 --> 33:32.660
 you know, how much liquid do you supply

33:32.660 --> 33:34.540
 and what field do you apply?

33:34.540 --> 33:37.980
 And why is it flickering on and off?

33:37.980 --> 33:39.780
 Or why does it have these weird behaviors?

33:39.780 --> 33:41.940
 So that's, in the past just couple of years,

33:41.940 --> 33:45.900
 that's become much more understood.

33:47.100 --> 33:49.260
 I think the two areas that come to mind

33:49.260 --> 33:53.460
 as far as not as well understood are

33:54.660 --> 33:57.340
 the boundary between, you know, you have,

33:58.660 --> 34:03.060
 we actually use kind of big molecular ions.

34:03.060 --> 34:06.740
 And if you're looking at the molecular scale,

34:07.700 --> 34:10.460
 you have, you know, some ions that you've extracted

34:10.460 --> 34:12.820
 and they're in this electric field.

34:12.820 --> 34:16.180
 One ion, you know, it's a big molecule,

34:16.180 --> 34:19.220
 it's getting energy from the electric field.

34:19.220 --> 34:21.780
 And some of that energy is going into the bonds

34:21.780 --> 34:24.260
 and making it vibrate and doing weird things to it.

34:24.260 --> 34:26.460
 Sometimes it breaks them apart.

34:26.460 --> 34:30.460
 And then zooming out to the whole beam,

34:30.460 --> 34:34.740
 the beam has some behaviors as this beam of ions.

34:34.740 --> 34:38.100
 And there's a big gap between what are those,

34:38.100 --> 34:40.540
 how do you connect those?

34:40.540 --> 34:42.260
 And how do we understand that better

34:42.260 --> 34:44.460
 so that we can understand the beam performance

34:44.460 --> 34:45.780
 of the engine?

34:45.780 --> 34:48.740
 Is that a theory question or is it an engineering question?

34:48.740 --> 34:50.140
 Theory, definitely.

34:50.140 --> 34:54.380
 We're, Axion is a startup and we're more in the business

34:54.380 --> 34:59.380
 of building and testing and observing and characterizing.

34:59.380 --> 35:03.060
 And we're not really diving much into that theory right now.

35:03.060 --> 35:06.300
 Okay, zooming out a little bit on the physics,

35:06.300 --> 35:08.300
 apologize for the way too big of a question,

35:08.300 --> 35:13.300
 but to you from either, you mentioned Axion is,

35:13.700 --> 35:16.740
 you know, more of sort of an engineering endeavor, right?

35:16.740 --> 35:19.740
 But from a perspective of physics in general,

35:19.740 --> 35:22.500
 science in general, or the side of engineering,

35:22.500 --> 35:24.700
 what do you think is the most, to you,

35:24.700 --> 35:26.980
 like beautiful and captivating

35:26.980 --> 35:29.740
 and inspiring idea in this space?

35:30.620 --> 35:33.420
 In this space, and then I'm gonna zoom out

35:33.420 --> 35:35.660
 a little bit more, but in this space,

35:35.660 --> 35:40.660
 I keep butting up against material science questions.

35:41.780 --> 35:45.020
 So I, over the past 10 years,

35:45.020 --> 35:49.660
 I feel like every problem or interesting thing

35:49.660 --> 35:52.460
 I want to work on, if you dig deep enough,

35:52.460 --> 35:55.380
 you end up in material science land,

35:55.380 --> 35:57.860
 which I find kind of exciting

35:57.860 --> 36:00.740
 and it makes me want to dig in more there.

36:00.740 --> 36:05.740
 And I was just, you know, even for our technology,

36:06.340 --> 36:09.140
 when we have to move the propellant from the tank

36:09.140 --> 36:12.820
 to the tip of the emitters, we rely a lot on capillary action

36:12.820 --> 36:15.980
 and you're getting into wetting and surface energies.

36:15.980 --> 36:17.900
 At a scale of like nano scale.

36:17.900 --> 36:22.180
 Yeah, I mean, it's, if you look further, it's quantum too,

36:22.180 --> 36:25.220
 but it all is, you know,

36:25.220 --> 36:27.860
 a capillary action at the quantum level.

36:27.860 --> 36:32.780
 Yeah, so I would, it all comes back to me to, you know,

36:32.780 --> 36:35.420
 material science, there's so much we don't understand

36:35.420 --> 36:40.420
 at these sizes and I find that inspiring and exciting.

36:43.340 --> 36:45.980
 And then more broadly, you know,

36:45.980 --> 36:49.980
 I remember when I learned that the same equation

36:49.980 --> 36:53.740
 that describes flow over an airfoil

36:53.740 --> 36:57.420
 is used to price options, the Black Scholes equation,

36:57.420 --> 37:01.420
 and it's, you know, just a partial differential equation,

37:01.420 --> 37:06.420
 but that kind of connectedness of the universe,

37:06.500 --> 37:09.300
 you know, I don't want to use options pricing

37:09.300 --> 37:11.540
 and the universe in the same, but you know what I mean,

37:11.540 --> 37:15.300
 this connectedness I find really magical.

37:15.300 --> 37:17.820
 Yeah, the patterns that mathematics reveals

37:17.820 --> 37:20.340
 seems to echo in a bunch of different places.

37:20.340 --> 37:21.180
 Yes.

37:21.180 --> 37:22.260
 Yeah, there's just weirdness.

37:22.260 --> 37:25.060
 It's like, it really makes you think,

37:25.060 --> 37:27.260
 I think you're definitely living in a simulation,

37:27.260 --> 37:29.020
 like whoever programmed it.

37:29.020 --> 37:30.380
 I like that that's your conclusion.

37:30.380 --> 37:34.340
 Is using like shortcuts to program it,

37:34.340 --> 37:36.940
 like they didn't, they're just copying and pasting some codes

37:36.940 --> 37:38.180
 for the different parts.

37:38.180 --> 37:41.540
 Yeah, think of something new or just paste from over there.

37:41.540 --> 37:42.780
 They won't notice.

37:42.780 --> 37:45.780
 My conclusion from that was I'm gonna go interview

37:45.780 --> 37:49.540
 for a finance job, so I had like a little detour.

37:49.540 --> 37:51.700
 That's the backup option.

37:51.700 --> 37:56.020
 So in terms of using call it engines,

37:56.020 --> 37:59.260
 what's an interesting difference between a propulsion

37:59.260 --> 38:02.340
 of a rocket from earth when you're standing

38:02.340 --> 38:06.100
 on the ground to orbit and then the kind of propulsion

38:06.100 --> 38:08.420
 necessary for once you get out to orbit

38:08.420 --> 38:12.800
 or to like deep space to move around.

38:13.980 --> 38:18.980
 Yes, the reason you can't use an engine like mine

38:18.980 --> 38:23.980
 to get off the ground is, the thrust it generates

38:24.500 --> 38:27.180
 is instantaneous thrust is very small,

38:27.180 --> 38:31.380
 but if you have the time and can accumulate

38:31.380 --> 38:33.780
 that acceleration, you can still reach speeds

38:33.780 --> 38:37.140
 that are very interesting for exploration

38:37.140 --> 38:40.140
 and even for missions with humans on them.

38:41.540 --> 38:45.860
 An interesting direction I think we need to go

38:45.860 --> 38:50.860
 as humans exploring space is the power supplies

38:51.820 --> 38:55.140
 for electric propulsion are limiting us

38:55.140 --> 38:58.940
 in that solar panels are really inefficient

38:58.940 --> 39:01.060
 and bulky and batteries.

39:01.060 --> 39:04.420
 I don't know when anybody's ever gonna improve

39:04.420 --> 39:05.860
 battery technology.

39:05.860 --> 39:07.860
 I know a lot of people that work on that.

39:09.180 --> 39:14.180
 And nuclear power, we could have a lot more powerful

39:14.420 --> 39:15.660
 electric propulsion system.

39:15.660 --> 39:17.940
 So they would be extremely fuel efficient,

39:17.940 --> 39:20.940
 but more instantaneous thrust to do more interesting

39:20.940 --> 39:25.260
 missions if we could start launching more nuclear systems.

39:25.260 --> 39:29.660
 So like something that's powered, nuclear powered,

39:29.660 --> 39:31.420
 that's the right way to say it.

39:31.420 --> 39:32.720
 Yeah.

39:32.720 --> 39:36.420
 But is in a small enough container that could be launched?

39:36.420 --> 39:41.420
 Yeah, so I mean, as a world we do launch spacecraft

39:42.100 --> 39:45.180
 with nuclear power systems on board,

39:45.180 --> 39:47.780
 but size is one consideration.

39:47.780 --> 39:49.140
 It hasn't been a big focus.

39:49.140 --> 39:53.940
 So the reactors and the heaters and everything are bulky.

39:53.940 --> 39:56.300
 And so they're really only suitable for some

39:56.300 --> 39:59.900
 of the much bigger interplanetary stuff.

39:59.900 --> 40:03.340
 So that's one issue, but then it's a whole like rat's nest

40:03.340 --> 40:06.340
 of political stuff as well.

40:06.340 --> 40:10.180
 I heard, I think Elon described or somebody,

40:10.180 --> 40:13.300
 I think it was Elon that described the EV to all

40:13.300 --> 40:17.700
 like electrical, vertical takeoff and landing vehicles.

40:17.700 --> 40:21.220
 So basically saying rockets, obviously Elon is interested

40:21.220 --> 40:22.580
 in electric vehicles, right?

40:22.580 --> 40:27.580
 But he said that rockets can't, in the near term,

40:27.940 --> 40:30.300
 it doesn't make sense for them to be electrical.

40:32.540 --> 40:36.020
 What, do you see a world with the rockets that we use

40:36.020 --> 40:39.500
 to get into orbit are also electric based?

40:39.500 --> 40:43.660
 It's possible, you can produce the thrust levels you need,

40:43.660 --> 40:46.940
 but you need this, a much bigger power supply.

40:46.940 --> 40:49.180
 And I think that would be nuclear.

40:49.180 --> 40:52.380
 And the only way people have been able to launch them at all

40:52.380 --> 40:57.020
 is that they're in a 100 times redundancy safe mode

40:57.020 --> 40:59.060
 while they're being launched and they're not turned on

40:59.060 --> 41:00.620
 until they're farther off.

41:00.620 --> 41:04.020
 So if you were to actually try to use it on launch,

41:04.020 --> 41:06.680
 I think a lot of people would still have an issue with that,

41:06.680 --> 41:08.180
 but someday.

41:08.180 --> 41:11.020
 It's an interesting concept, nuclear.

41:11.020 --> 41:13.420
 It seems like people, like everybody that works

41:13.420 --> 41:16.740
 on nuclear power has shown how safe it is

41:16.740 --> 41:18.380
 as a source of energy.

41:18.380 --> 41:23.380
 And yet we are, seem to be, I mean, based on the history,

41:23.740 --> 41:26.180
 based on the excellent HBO series,

41:26.180 --> 41:28.220
 I'm Russian with a Chernobyl.

41:28.220 --> 41:31.220
 It seems like we have our risk estimation

41:31.220 --> 41:35.580
 about this particular power source is drastically inaccurate,

41:35.580 --> 41:39.660
 but that's a fascinating idea that we would use nuclear

41:39.660 --> 41:44.220
 as a source for our vehicles and not just in outer space.

41:44.220 --> 41:45.060
 That's cool.

41:45.060 --> 41:45.980
 I'm gonna have to look into that.

41:45.980 --> 41:47.000
 That's super interesting.

41:47.000 --> 41:50.980
 Well, just last year, Trump eased up a little bit

41:50.980 --> 41:55.140
 on the regulations and NASA and hopefully others

41:55.140 --> 41:57.860
 are starting to pick up on the development.

41:57.860 --> 42:00.260
 So now is a good time to look into it

42:00.260 --> 42:02.340
 because there's actually some movement.

42:02.340 --> 42:05.660
 Is that a hope for you to explore different energy sources

42:05.660 --> 42:09.180
 that the entirety of the vehicle uses something

42:09.180 --> 42:13.060
 like the entirety of the propulsion systems

42:13.060 --> 42:16.980
 for all aspects of the vehicle's life travel

42:16.980 --> 42:19.000
 is the same or electric?

42:19.000 --> 42:20.460
 Is it possible for it to be the same?

42:20.460 --> 42:24.340
 Like the colloid engine being used for everything?

42:24.340 --> 42:27.440
 You could, and you would have to do it in the same way

42:27.440 --> 42:29.580
 we do different stages of rockets now

42:29.580 --> 42:34.580
 where once you've used up an engine or a stage,

42:34.820 --> 42:36.740
 you let it go because there's really no point

42:36.740 --> 42:37.580
 in holding onto it.

42:37.580 --> 42:41.140
 So I wouldn't necessarily want to use the same engine

42:41.140 --> 42:42.860
 for the whole thing, but the same technology

42:42.860 --> 42:45.060
 I think would be interesting.

42:45.060 --> 42:46.260
 Okay, so it's possible.

42:46.260 --> 42:47.780
 All right, but in terms of.

42:47.780 --> 42:49.420
 Yeah, it comes down to the power source.

42:49.420 --> 42:51.100
 The power source, that's really interesting.

42:51.100 --> 42:52.540
 But for the current power sources

42:52.540 --> 42:55.020
 and its current use cases, what's the use case

42:55.020 --> 42:58.940
 for electric, like the colloid engine?

42:58.940 --> 43:01.600
 Can you talk about where they're used today?

43:01.600 --> 43:06.600
 Sure, so chemical engines are still used quite a bit

43:06.600 --> 43:09.340
 once you're in orbit, but that's also

43:09.340 --> 43:12.500
 where you might choose instead to use an electric system

43:12.500 --> 43:15.460
 and what people do with them.

43:15.460 --> 43:18.620
 And this includes the ion engines and hall thrusters

43:18.620 --> 43:22.580
 and our engine is basically any maneuvering you need to do

43:22.580 --> 43:24.060
 once you're dropped off.

43:24.060 --> 43:29.060
 Even if your only goal was to just stay in your orbit

43:30.140 --> 43:32.540
 and not move for the life of your mission,

43:32.540 --> 43:34.620
 you need propulsion to accomplish that

43:34.620 --> 43:38.300
 because the Earth's gravity field changes

43:38.300 --> 43:40.260
 as you go around in orbit and pulls you

43:40.260 --> 43:42.580
 out of your little box.

43:42.580 --> 43:47.580
 There are other perturbations that can throw you off a bit.

43:47.940 --> 43:50.740
 And then most people want to do things

43:50.740 --> 43:53.460
 a little bit more interesting like maneuver

43:53.460 --> 43:55.940
 to avoid being hit by space debris

43:55.940 --> 44:00.280
 or perhaps lower their orbit to take a higher resolution

44:00.280 --> 44:02.980
 image of something and then return.

44:02.980 --> 44:06.500
 At the end of your mission, you're supposed

44:06.500 --> 44:09.460
 to responsibly get rid of your satellite,

44:09.460 --> 44:13.560
 whether that's burning it up, but if you're in geo,

44:13.560 --> 44:15.980
 you want to push it higher into graveyard orbit.

44:17.380 --> 44:19.340
 What's geo and what's graveyard?

44:19.340 --> 44:21.920
 So low Earth orbit and then geosynchronous orbit

44:21.920 --> 44:23.220
 or geostationary orbit.

44:23.220 --> 44:24.740
 And there's a graveyard?

44:24.740 --> 44:29.380
 Yeah, so those satellites are at like 40,000 kilometers.

44:29.380 --> 44:33.100
 So if they were to try to push their satellites

44:33.100 --> 44:35.460
 back down to burn up in the atmosphere,

44:35.460 --> 44:37.840
 they would need even more propulsion

44:37.840 --> 44:40.580
 than they've had for the whole lifetime of their mission.

44:40.580 --> 44:42.420
 So instead they push them higher

44:42.420 --> 44:44.220
 where it'll take a million years

44:44.220 --> 44:46.820
 for it to naturally deorbit.

44:46.820 --> 44:50.220
 So we're also cluttering that higher bit up as well,

44:50.220 --> 44:54.180
 but it's not as pressing as Leo, which is low Earth orbit

44:54.180 --> 44:56.340
 where more of these commercial missions are going now.

44:56.340 --> 44:59.300
 Well, so how hard is the collision avoidance problem there?

44:59.300 --> 45:00.840
 You said some debris and stuff.

45:00.840 --> 45:03.780
 So like how much propulsion is needed?

45:03.780 --> 45:05.860
 Like how much is the life of a satellite

45:05.860 --> 45:08.380
 is just like a crap trying to avoid

45:08.380 --> 45:09.580
 like little things down there?

45:09.580 --> 45:14.580
 I think one of the recent rules of thumb I heard

45:14.620 --> 45:17.520
 was per year some of these small satellites

45:17.520 --> 45:20.840
 are doing like three collision avoidance maneuvers.

45:21.860 --> 45:25.320
 So that's not, yeah, but it's not zero.

45:25.320 --> 45:30.320
 And it takes a lot of planning and people on the ground

45:30.860 --> 45:34.700
 and none of that really, I don't think right now

45:34.700 --> 45:36.260
 is autonomous.

45:36.260 --> 45:37.620
 Oh, that's not good.

45:37.620 --> 45:39.900
 Yeah, and then we have a lot of folks

45:39.900 --> 45:42.980
 taking advantage of Moore's law and cheaper spacecraft.

45:42.980 --> 45:44.020
 So they're launching them up

45:44.020 --> 45:46.060
 without the ability to maneuver themselves.

45:46.060 --> 45:49.140
 And they're like, well, I don't know, just don't hit me.

45:49.140 --> 45:51.580
 And three times a year that could become affordable

45:51.580 --> 45:56.380
 if it gets hit, maybe it won't be damaged kind of thing,

45:56.380 --> 45:57.660
 that kind of logic.

45:57.660 --> 46:00.940
 Affordable in that instead of launching one satellite,

46:00.940 --> 46:02.740
 they'll launch 20 small ones.

46:02.740 --> 46:05.100
 Yeah, so if one gets taken out, that's okay.

46:05.100 --> 46:08.100
 But the problem is that one good sized satellite

46:08.100 --> 46:11.740
 getting hit, that's like a ballistic event

46:11.740 --> 46:14.080
 that turns into 10,000 pieces of debris

46:14.080 --> 46:17.460
 that then are the things that go and hit the other satellites.

46:17.460 --> 46:18.300
 Yeah.

46:18.300 --> 46:22.380
 So do you see a world where, like in your sense,

46:22.380 --> 46:25.780
 in your own work and just in the space industry in general,

46:25.780 --> 46:28.220
 do you see the people moving towards bigger satellites

46:28.220 --> 46:29.820
 or smaller satellites?

46:29.820 --> 46:31.260
 Is there going to be a mix?

46:31.260 --> 46:32.860
 Like what's, and what do we talk,

46:32.860 --> 46:36.300
 what does it mean for a satellite to be big and small?

46:36.300 --> 46:37.140
 What size are we talking about?

46:37.140 --> 46:42.140
 So big, the space industry prior to,

46:42.140 --> 46:45.660
 I don't know, 1990, I guess the bulk of,

46:45.660 --> 46:49.020
 the majority of satellites were the size of a school bus

46:49.020 --> 46:53.220
 and cost a couple billion dollars.

46:53.220 --> 46:58.220
 And now our first launches were on satellites

47:00.020 --> 47:01.860
 the size of shoe boxes that were built

47:01.860 --> 47:03.060
 by high school students.

47:03.060 --> 47:05.380
 So that's a very different,

47:05.380 --> 47:07.500
 to give you the two ends of the spectrum.

47:07.500 --> 47:12.320
 So big satellites will, I think they're here to stay,

47:12.320 --> 47:15.640
 at least as far as I can see into the future

47:15.640 --> 47:18.700
 for things like broadcasting.

47:18.700 --> 47:21.720
 You want to be able to broadcast

47:21.720 --> 47:24.020
 to as many people as possible.

47:25.920 --> 47:28.840
 You also can't just go to small satellites

47:28.840 --> 47:32.040
 and say Moore's law for things like optics.

47:32.040 --> 47:34.680
 So if you have an aperture on your satellite,

47:34.680 --> 47:36.640
 that just, that doesn't follow Moore's law.

47:36.640 --> 47:37.800
 That's different.

47:37.800 --> 47:40.560
 So it's always going to be the size that it will be,

47:40.560 --> 47:43.120
 unless there's some new physics that comes out

47:43.120 --> 47:44.320
 that I'm not aware of.

47:44.320 --> 47:46.640
 But if you need a resolution and you're at an altitude,

47:46.640 --> 47:49.200
 that kind of sets your, the size of your telescope.

47:50.320 --> 47:52.800
 But because of Moore's law,

47:52.800 --> 47:56.840
 we are able to do a lot more with smaller packages.

47:56.840 --> 48:00.320
 And with that comes more affordability

48:00.320 --> 48:03.800
 and opening up access to space to more and more people.

48:03.800 --> 48:06.280
 Well, what's the smallest satellite you've seen go up there?

48:06.280 --> 48:09.360
 Like what are the smallest kind of, you said shoe boxes.

48:09.360 --> 48:14.360
 Yeah, so I think the smallest common form factor

48:14.800 --> 48:17.680
 can fit a softball inside.

48:17.680 --> 48:21.360
 So that's 10 centimeters on each side.

48:21.360 --> 48:24.440
 But then there are some companies working on

48:24.440 --> 48:26.360
 fractions of that even.

48:26.360 --> 48:30.480
 And they're doing things like IOT type application.

48:30.480 --> 48:34.520
 So it's very low bandwidth type things,

48:34.520 --> 48:37.320
 but they're finding some niches for those.

48:37.320 --> 48:38.520
 Do you mean like there's a business,

48:38.520 --> 48:40.440
 there's a thing to do with them?

48:40.440 --> 48:41.280
 Yes, either.

48:41.280 --> 48:44.040
 What do you do with a small satellite like that?

48:44.040 --> 48:48.360
 You can track a ship going across the ocean.

48:48.360 --> 48:51.120
 Like if you need to, if you're just pinging something,

48:51.120 --> 48:53.800
 you can handle that amount of data

48:53.800 --> 48:56.160
 and those latencies and so on.

48:56.160 --> 48:57.400
 You have to have propulsion on that.

48:57.400 --> 48:58.760
 You have to have a little engine.

48:58.760 --> 49:02.720
 No, those are just letting fall out of the sky.

49:02.720 --> 49:06.440
 Okay, so what kind of satellite

49:06.440 --> 49:08.920
 would you equip a colloid engine on?

49:08.920 --> 49:13.080
 Anything that's bigger than probably about 20 kilograms,

49:13.080 --> 49:16.400
 anything that needs to stay up for more than a year

49:16.400 --> 49:20.280
 or anything somebody spent more than like 100K to build

49:20.280 --> 49:21.920
 are kind of the ways I would think about it.

49:21.920 --> 49:23.560
 That's a lot of use cases.

49:23.560 --> 49:26.080
 What's a small sat?

49:26.080 --> 49:26.920
 Like what category?

49:26.920 --> 49:28.560
 Small sat is actually very big.

49:28.560 --> 49:31.360
 I think it's like 700 kilograms,

49:31.360 --> 49:33.840
 or I keep hitting my microphone,

49:33.840 --> 49:38.840
 maybe 1,000 kilograms down to 200 kilograms.

49:40.080 --> 49:42.360
 People have their own kind of definitions

49:42.360 --> 49:43.320
 of how they break them up,

49:43.320 --> 49:46.000
 but small sat is still quite large.

49:46.000 --> 49:49.880
 And then it's kind of also applied as a blanket term

49:49.880 --> 49:52.920
 for anything that's not a school bus size satellite.

49:52.920 --> 49:56.360
 So we need to get our jargon straight in the industry.

49:56.360 --> 50:00.040
 So do you see a possible future where,

50:00.040 --> 50:02.520
 you know, there's a few thousand satellites up there now,

50:02.520 --> 50:04.520
 a couple of thousand of them functioning.

50:05.440 --> 50:07.520
 Do you see a future where there's like millions

50:07.520 --> 50:09.960
 of satellites up in orbit?

50:09.960 --> 50:13.000
 Or forget millions, tens of thousands,

50:13.000 --> 50:16.200
 which just seems like where the natural trajectory

50:16.200 --> 50:20.160
 of the way things are going now is going.

50:20.160 --> 50:22.480
 Tens of thousands, yes.

50:22.480 --> 50:26.360
 The two buckets of applications,

50:26.360 --> 50:30.480
 one is imaging and the other is communication.

50:30.480 --> 50:35.160
 So imaging, I think that will plateau

50:35.160 --> 50:39.120
 because one satellite or one constellation

50:39.120 --> 50:40.680
 can take an image or a video

50:40.680 --> 50:44.320
 and sell it to, you know, infinity customers.

50:44.320 --> 50:47.560
 But if you're providing communications

50:47.560 --> 50:51.640
 like broadband internet or satellite cell

50:51.640 --> 50:54.120
 or something like that, satellite phone,

50:54.120 --> 50:58.680
 you know, you're limited by your transponders and so on.

50:58.680 --> 51:02.040
 So to serve more people, you actually need more satellites

51:02.040 --> 51:06.440
 and perhaps at the rate, you know, our data consumption

51:06.440 --> 51:08.840
 and things are going these days.

51:08.840 --> 51:11.200
 Yeah, I can see tens of thousands of satellites.

51:12.720 --> 51:14.480
 Can I ask you a ridiculous question?

51:14.480 --> 51:15.360
 Yes.

51:15.360 --> 51:18.720
 So I've recently watched this documentary on Netflix

51:18.720 --> 51:23.240
 about flat earthers, you know,

51:23.240 --> 51:25.920
 the people that believe in a flat earth.

51:25.920 --> 51:30.040
 As somebody who develops propulsion systems

51:30.040 --> 51:33.080
 for satellites and for spacecraft,

51:33.960 --> 51:37.600
 what's, do you use the most convincing evidence

51:37.600 --> 51:38.840
 that the earth is round?

51:40.760 --> 51:45.760
 Probably some of the photos taken from the moon.

51:48.800 --> 51:49.760
 Photos from the moon?

51:49.760 --> 51:52.960
 Okay, so it's not from the satellite space.

51:52.960 --> 51:56.080
 Yeah, I think seeing that perspective,

51:57.560 --> 52:00.400
 maybe I'm just, I'm answering too personally

52:00.400 --> 52:03.000
 because I really love those photos.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
 Because they're beautiful, yeah.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.400
 I really like the ones that show the moon

52:06.400 --> 52:09.920
 and the lunar lander and they're taken

52:09.920 --> 52:10.840
 a little bit farther back.

52:10.840 --> 52:14.280
 So you see earth and first you're like, wow, that's tiny

52:14.280 --> 52:17.800
 and we're insignificant and that's kind of sad.

52:17.800 --> 52:19.720
 But then you see this really cool thing

52:19.720 --> 52:23.760
 that we landed on another planetary body

52:23.760 --> 52:24.840
 and you're like, oh, okay.

52:24.840 --> 52:26.760
 Can you actually see earth?

52:26.760 --> 52:27.600
 I don't know if I remember this.

52:27.600 --> 52:29.160
 Yeah, I'll send you that picture.

52:29.160 --> 52:31.520
 Because I love the pictures or videos

52:31.520 --> 52:34.040
 of just earth from orbit and so on.

52:34.040 --> 52:34.880
 Right, yeah.

52:34.880 --> 52:36.240
 Just like those, that's really beautiful.

52:36.240 --> 52:38.080
 That's like a perspective shifter.

52:38.080 --> 52:39.760
 That's the pale blue dot, right?

52:39.760 --> 52:41.400
 It probably appears tiny.

52:41.400 --> 52:46.280
 Yeah, and just that juxtaposition of the insignificance,

52:46.280 --> 52:49.240
 but we built this, really cool thing.

52:49.240 --> 52:50.720
 And I just love that, yeah.

52:50.720 --> 52:51.560
 Oh, that'd be cool.

52:51.560 --> 52:53.080
 I can't, I personally love the idea

52:53.080 --> 52:54.480
 of humans stepping on Mars.

52:54.480 --> 52:57.840
 I'm such a sucker for the romantic notion of that

52:57.840 --> 53:01.680
 and being able to take pictures from Mars next.

53:01.680 --> 53:03.160
 So you would go?

53:03.160 --> 53:08.080
 I, yeah, I would be, what did you say?

53:08.080 --> 53:09.120
 You said you wouldn't be the first one.

53:09.120 --> 53:10.600
 Not in the first 1,000.

53:10.600 --> 53:14.400
 1,000, which it's funny because to me,

53:14.400 --> 53:17.200
 that's brave to be in the first million.

53:17.200 --> 53:21.160
 I think when the Declaration of Independence

53:21.160 --> 53:22.680
 was signed in the United States,

53:22.680 --> 53:25.640
 that was like two million people.

53:25.640 --> 53:27.320
 So I would like to show up

53:27.320 --> 53:29.200
 when they're signing those documents.

53:29.200 --> 53:30.040
 Okay.

53:30.040 --> 53:31.080
 So maybe the two million.

53:31.080 --> 53:32.880
 Oh, that's an interesting way to think about it.

53:32.880 --> 53:35.160
 Because like then we're like participating

53:35.160 --> 53:38.040
 in citizenry and defining the direction.

53:38.040 --> 53:41.160
 So it's not the technical risk.

53:41.160 --> 53:43.440
 You just don't wanna show up somewhere

53:43.440 --> 53:46.120
 that's like America before.

53:46.120 --> 53:51.120
 Yeah, because I, from a psychological perspective,

53:51.560 --> 53:54.120
 it's just gonna be a stressful mess

53:54.120 --> 53:56.240
 as people have studied, right?

53:56.240 --> 54:01.240
 It's like, it's people, most likely the process

54:02.080 --> 54:07.080
 of colonization like looks like basically a prison.

54:07.320 --> 54:10.520
 Like you're in a very tight and closed space with people.

54:10.520 --> 54:13.440
 And it's just a really stressful environment.

54:13.440 --> 54:15.400
 How do you select the kind of people that will go

54:15.400 --> 54:16.480
 and then there'll be drama.

54:16.480 --> 54:17.520
 There's always drama.

54:17.520 --> 54:21.360
 And I just wanna show up when there's some rules.

54:21.360 --> 54:22.960
 But I mean, you know, it depends.

54:22.960 --> 54:24.360
 So I'm not worried about the health

54:24.360 --> 54:26.120
 and the technical difficulties.

54:26.120 --> 54:29.520
 I'm more worried about the psychological difficulties.

54:29.520 --> 54:31.320
 And also just not being able to tweet.

54:31.320 --> 54:33.640
 Like what are you gonna, how are you talking?

54:33.640 --> 54:34.640
 There's no Netflix.

54:34.640 --> 54:37.360
 So yeah, maybe not in the first million,

54:37.360 --> 54:39.880
 but the first 100,000.

54:39.880 --> 54:42.680
 It's exciting to define the direction of a new,

54:42.680 --> 54:46.240
 like how often do we not just have a revolution

54:46.240 --> 54:48.200
 to redefine our government,

54:48.200 --> 54:51.240
 as smaller countries are still doing to this day,

54:51.240 --> 54:54.200
 but literally start over from scratch.

54:54.200 --> 54:56.840
 There's just our financial system.

54:56.840 --> 54:59.640
 It could be like based on cryptocurrency,

54:59.640 --> 55:02.560
 you could think about like how democracy,

55:02.560 --> 55:06.880
 we have now the technology that can enable pure democracy,

55:06.880 --> 55:09.720
 for example, if we choose to do that,

55:09.720 --> 55:11.520
 as opposed to representative democracy,

55:11.520 --> 55:12.800
 all those kinds of things.

55:12.800 --> 55:16.560
 So we talked about two different forms of propulsion,

55:16.560 --> 55:18.000
 which are super exciting.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.720
 So the chemical based, that's doing pretty well.

55:20.720 --> 55:23.000
 And then the electric based is,

55:24.440 --> 55:26.880
 are there types of propulsion

55:26.880 --> 55:29.200
 that might sound like science fiction right now,

55:29.200 --> 55:31.280
 but are actually within the reach of science

55:31.280 --> 55:34.240
 in the next 10, 20, 30, 50 years

55:34.240 --> 55:35.960
 that you kind of think about,

55:35.960 --> 55:39.280
 or maybe even within the space of even just like,

55:39.280 --> 55:42.400
 like even ION engines,

55:42.400 --> 55:45.600
 is there like breakthroughs that might 10 X the thing,

55:45.600 --> 55:47.760
 like really improve it?

55:47.760 --> 55:50.520
 So, you know, the real game changer

55:50.520 --> 55:54.160
 would be propellantless propulsion.

55:54.160 --> 55:57.600
 And so every couple of years you see a new,

55:57.600 --> 56:02.600
 now a startup or a researcher comes up with some contraption

56:03.080 --> 56:06.080
 for producing thrust that didn't require,

56:06.080 --> 56:08.280
 you know, we've been talking about conservation of momentum,

56:08.280 --> 56:11.680
 mass times velocity out the back,

56:11.680 --> 56:13.520
 mass times velocity forward.

56:13.520 --> 56:14.840
 Yes, exactly.

56:14.840 --> 56:18.600
 And you have to, you know, carry that up with you

56:18.600 --> 56:21.840
 or find it on an asteroid or harvest it from somewhere

56:21.840 --> 56:22.960
 if you didn't bring it with you.

56:22.960 --> 56:25.960
 So not having to do that would be, you know,

56:25.960 --> 56:28.720
 one of the ultimate game changers.

56:28.720 --> 56:33.720
 And I, you know, unless there are new types of physics,

56:35.360 --> 56:36.800
 I don't know how we do it,

56:36.800 --> 56:39.800
 but it comes up often, so it's something I do think about.

56:39.800 --> 56:41.680
 And, you know, the one,

56:41.680 --> 56:44.360
 I think it's called the Casimir effect.

56:44.360 --> 56:46.640
 If you can, if you have two plates

56:46.640 --> 56:49.920
 and the space between them is on the order of these,

56:49.920 --> 56:53.520
 like the wavelength of these ephemeral vacuum particles

56:53.520 --> 56:56.040
 that pop into and out of existence or something.

56:57.760 --> 57:01.440
 I may be confusing multiple types of propellantless forces,

57:01.440 --> 57:06.440
 but that could be real

57:06.920 --> 57:10.640
 and could be something that we use eventually.

57:10.640 --> 57:12.280
 What would be the power source?

57:12.280 --> 57:15.120
 Yeah, the most recent engine like this

57:15.120 --> 57:19.640
 that was just debunked this year, I think,

57:19.640 --> 57:22.400
 in March or something was called the M drive.

57:22.400 --> 57:26.080
 And supposedly you used a power source,

57:26.080 --> 57:27.960
 so, you know, batteries or solar panels

57:27.960 --> 57:32.640
 to generate microwaves into this resonant cavity.

57:32.640 --> 57:35.480
 And people claimed it produced thrust.

57:35.480 --> 57:38.640
 So they went straight from this really loose concept

57:38.640 --> 57:40.160
 to building a device and testing it.

57:40.160 --> 57:42.200
 And they said, we've measured thrust

57:42.200 --> 57:44.520
 and sure on their thrust balance, they saw thrust

57:44.520 --> 57:47.960
 and different researchers built it and tested it

57:47.960 --> 57:49.240
 and got the same measurements.

57:49.240 --> 57:52.080
 And so it was looking actually pretty good.

57:52.080 --> 57:53.440
 No one could explain how it worked,

57:53.440 --> 57:58.440
 but what they said was that this inside the cavity,

57:59.160 --> 58:01.320
 the microwaves themselves didn't change,

58:01.320 --> 58:03.960
 but the speed of light changed inside the cavity.

58:03.960 --> 58:06.520
 So relative to that, you know,

58:06.520 --> 58:08.880
 their momentum was conserved.

58:09.880 --> 58:14.640
 And I don't, you know, whatever.

58:14.640 --> 58:17.800
 But finally someone, I think at NASA built the device,

58:17.800 --> 58:20.560
 tested it, got the same thrust, then unhooked it,

58:20.560 --> 58:22.240
 flipped it backwards and turned it on,

58:22.240 --> 58:24.760
 but got the same thrust in the same direction again.

58:24.760 --> 58:26.800
 And so they're like, this is just an interaction

58:26.800 --> 58:28.520
 with the test setup or, you know,

58:28.520 --> 58:30.640
 some of the chamber or something like that.

58:30.640 --> 58:34.640
 So forwarded again, but, you know,

58:34.640 --> 58:36.640
 it would be so wonderful for everybody

58:36.640 --> 58:39.560
 if we could figure out how to do it, but I don't know.

58:39.560 --> 58:41.480
 That's an interesting twist on it

58:41.480 --> 58:44.920
 because that's more about efficient travel,

58:44.920 --> 58:46.160
 long distance travel, right?

58:46.160 --> 58:47.960
 That's not necessarily about speed.

58:49.040 --> 58:51.160
 That's more about enabling like,

58:51.160 --> 58:55.400
 let's hook that up to the nuclear power supply.

58:55.400 --> 58:56.240
 There you go.

58:56.240 --> 58:57.560
 Okay.

58:57.560 --> 59:01.360
 But still in terms of speed, in terms of trying to,

59:01.360 --> 59:06.000
 so there's recently, already I think been debunked

59:06.000 --> 59:09.680
 or close to being debunked, but the signal,

59:09.680 --> 59:13.680
 a weird signal from our nearby friends,

59:13.680 --> 59:16.560
 nearby exoplanets from Proxima Centauri,

59:16.560 --> 59:21.560
 a signal that's 4.2 light years away.

59:22.440 --> 59:27.440
 So, you know, the thought is it'd be kind of cool

59:28.120 --> 59:30.320
 if there's life out there, alien life,

59:31.440 --> 59:34.360
 but it'd be really cool if it could fly out there and check.

59:34.360 --> 59:37.000
 And so what kind of propulsion,

59:37.000 --> 59:39.360
 and do you think about what kind of propulsion

59:39.360 --> 59:42.120
 will allow us to travel close to the speed of light

59:42.120 --> 59:43.680
 or, you know, half the speed of light,

59:43.680 --> 59:45.520
 all those kinds of things that would allow us

59:45.520 --> 59:48.360
 to get to Proxima Centauri and have reasonable,

59:48.360 --> 59:49.360
 in a lifetime?

59:50.560 --> 59:54.800
 You know, there's the project Breakthrough Starshot.

59:54.800 --> 59:55.640
 Yeah.

59:55.640 --> 59:59.640
 That's looking at sending those tiny little chip sets.

59:59.640 --> 1:00:01.840
 They're like accelerating really fast.

1:00:01.840 --> 1:00:04.160
 Yeah, using a laser, so launching them

1:00:04.160 --> 1:00:06.800
 and then while they're still relatively close to the earth,

1:00:06.800 --> 1:00:09.160
 you know, blasting them with some,

1:00:09.160 --> 1:00:12.800
 I forget what, even what power level you needed

1:00:12.800 --> 1:00:15.720
 to accelerate them fast enough to get there in 20 years.

1:00:15.720 --> 1:00:16.760
 Super crazy sounding,

1:00:16.760 --> 1:00:19.440
 but a lot of people say that's a legitimate,

1:00:19.440 --> 1:00:22.320
 like it's crazy sounding, but it can actually pull it off.

1:00:22.320 --> 1:00:24.160
 Yeah, I love that project

1:00:24.160 --> 1:00:26.080
 because there are a lot of different aspects.

1:00:26.080 --> 1:00:27.360
 You know, there's the laser,

1:00:27.360 --> 1:00:31.280
 there's how do you then get enough power

1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:33.200
 when you're there to send a signal back.

1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:35.640
 No part of that project is possible right now,

1:00:35.640 --> 1:00:38.320
 but I think it's really exciting.

1:00:38.320 --> 1:00:42.880
 But do you see like human, like a spacecraft

1:00:42.880 --> 1:00:45.520
 with a human on it, so it's like a heavy one,

1:00:45.520 --> 1:00:49.120
 being like us inventing new propulsion systems entirely.

1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:52.400
 Like, do you ever see that on the radar

1:00:52.400 --> 1:00:54.000
 of propulsion systems like that

1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:57.280
 or are they completely out there in the impossible?

1:00:57.280 --> 1:00:59.720
 Well, we're going to quickly leave the realm

1:00:59.720 --> 1:01:03.200
 of what I can describe with any credibility,

1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:08.080
 but I think because of special relativity,

1:01:08.080 --> 1:01:10.640
 if we try to accelerate some mass

1:01:10.640 --> 1:01:15.280
 close to the speed of light, it becomes infinitely heavy

1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:17.080
 and then we just don't,

1:01:17.080 --> 1:01:20.400
 we'd have to like harness a lot of suns to do that.

1:01:20.400 --> 1:01:25.080
 Or, you know, it's just that math doesn't quite work out,

1:01:25.080 --> 1:01:30.080
 but, you know, in my child's, my childlike heart,

1:01:30.600 --> 1:01:33.840
 I believe that, you know, we're missing something,

1:01:33.840 --> 1:01:38.320
 whether it's, you know, dark matter or other dimensions.

1:01:38.320 --> 1:01:41.920
 And if you can just have some anti matter

1:01:41.920 --> 1:01:46.640
 and a black hole and then ride that around

1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:49.520
 and somehow, you know, turn that into some.

1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:51.240
 Mess with gravity somehow.

1:01:51.240 --> 1:01:55.520
 Yeah, I feel like we're missing lots of things

1:01:55.520 --> 1:02:00.080
 in this puzzle and that, you know.

1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:01.280
 I want to heart that puzzle.

1:02:01.280 --> 1:02:02.120
 Yeah, right.

1:02:02.120 --> 1:02:06.240
 I can speak with confidence as a descendant of apes

1:02:06.240 --> 1:02:08.520
 that we don't know what the hell we're doing.

1:02:08.520 --> 1:02:09.600
 Yeah.

1:02:09.600 --> 1:02:12.760
 So there's, we're like really confident,

1:02:12.760 --> 1:02:14.760
 like physicists are really confident

1:02:14.760 --> 1:02:17.480
 that we've like got most of the picture down,

1:02:17.480 --> 1:02:20.880
 but it feels like, oh boy,

1:02:20.880 --> 1:02:25.400
 it feels like that we might not even be getting started

1:02:25.400 --> 1:02:26.920
 on some of the essential things

1:02:26.920 --> 1:02:31.320
 that would allow us to engineer systems

1:02:31.320 --> 1:02:36.320
 that would allow us to travel to space much, much faster.

1:02:36.720 --> 1:02:38.200
 Yeah, and there's even things

1:02:38.200 --> 1:02:42.440
 that are much more commonplace that we can't explain,

1:02:42.440 --> 1:02:44.080
 but we've started to take for granted,

1:02:44.080 --> 1:02:48.360
 like quantum tunneling, you know,

1:02:48.360 --> 1:02:50.680
 just things like, oh, the electron was here

1:02:50.680 --> 1:02:53.160
 with this energy and now it's here with this energy

1:02:53.160 --> 1:02:55.600
 and it's just tunneling.

1:02:55.600 --> 1:02:58.080
 But so, you know, we're missing a lot of the picture.

1:02:58.080 --> 1:03:02.120
 So yeah, I don't know, to, you know,

1:03:02.120 --> 1:03:03.440
 use your same question from earlier,

1:03:03.440 --> 1:03:05.480
 I don't know if you and I will see it,

1:03:05.480 --> 1:03:07.920
 but yeah, someday.

1:03:07.920 --> 1:03:09.640
 You're the cofounder of,

1:03:09.640 --> 1:03:12.440
 just like we've been talking about, Axion Systems.

1:03:12.440 --> 1:03:15.920
 It's a, would you say a space propulsion company?

1:03:15.920 --> 1:03:16.760
 Yes.

1:03:16.760 --> 1:03:17.600
 Broadly speaking.

1:03:18.480 --> 1:03:22.240
 So how do you, big question,

1:03:22.240 --> 1:03:25.640
 how do you build a rocket company

1:03:25.640 --> 1:03:30.640
 from like a propulsion company from one person,

1:03:30.880 --> 1:03:35.240
 from two people to 10 people plus,

1:03:35.240 --> 1:03:40.240
 and actually, you know, take it to a successful product?

1:03:41.280 --> 1:03:44.480
 Yeah, well, I think the early stage is quite,

1:03:46.280 --> 1:03:48.440
 I'm not supposed to use the word easy

1:03:48.440 --> 1:03:49.760
 when you work in rocket science,

1:03:49.760 --> 1:03:53.160
 but straightforward when you're working on something,

1:03:53.160 --> 1:03:55.680
 you know, sexy, like an ion engine,

1:03:55.680 --> 1:03:58.680
 it's more straightforward to raise money

1:03:58.680 --> 1:04:00.800
 and get people to come work for you

1:04:00.800 --> 1:04:02.280
 because the vision's really exciting.

1:04:02.280 --> 1:04:04.640
 And actually that's something I would say

1:04:04.640 --> 1:04:06.120
 is very important throughout,

1:04:06.120 --> 1:04:10.040
 is a really exciting vision

1:04:10.040 --> 1:04:13.280
 because when everything, you know, goes to crap,

1:04:13.280 --> 1:04:15.360
 you need that to get people

1:04:15.360 --> 1:04:17.160
 getting themselves out of bed in the morning

1:04:17.160 --> 1:04:20.480
 and thinking of the higher purpose there.

1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:24.160
 And, you know, another thing along the way

1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:27.440
 that I think is key in building any company

1:04:27.440 --> 1:04:31.120
 is the right early employees

1:04:31.120 --> 1:04:33.800
 that also have their own networks

1:04:33.800 --> 1:04:36.960
 and can bring in a lot of people

1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:41.960
 that, you know, really make the whole greater

1:04:43.520 --> 1:04:46.640
 than just the sum of the early team.

1:04:46.640 --> 1:04:47.640
 How do you build that?

1:04:47.640 --> 1:04:49.360
 Like, how do you find people?

1:04:49.360 --> 1:04:52.400
 It's like asking, like, how do you make friends?

1:04:52.400 --> 1:04:55.920
 But is there, is it luck?

1:04:55.920 --> 1:04:57.840
 Is there a system?

1:04:57.840 --> 1:05:00.840
 Like how, in terms of the people you've connected with,

1:05:00.840 --> 1:05:05.440
 the people you built the company with,

1:05:07.360 --> 1:05:10.360
 is there some thread, some commonality,

1:05:10.360 --> 1:05:13.160
 some pattern that you find to be,

1:05:13.160 --> 1:05:15.720
 to hold for what makes a great team?

1:05:15.720 --> 1:05:18.320
 I think, you know, personally,

1:05:18.320 --> 1:05:21.840
 a thread for me has been my network

1:05:21.840 --> 1:05:25.840
 and being able to draw on that a lot,

1:05:25.840 --> 1:05:29.960
 but also giving back to it as much as possible

1:05:29.960 --> 1:05:32.040
 in like an unsolicited sort of way,

1:05:32.040 --> 1:05:34.840
 like making connections between people

1:05:34.840 --> 1:05:36.800
 that, you know, maybe didn't ask,

1:05:36.800 --> 1:05:39.520
 but that I think could be really fruitful.

1:05:39.520 --> 1:05:42.960
 And even, you know, weirder than that

1:05:42.960 --> 1:05:46.920
 is just really getting, you know,

1:05:46.920 --> 1:05:49.520
 having weird, uncomfortable conversations

1:05:49.520 --> 1:05:51.160
 with people like at a conference

1:05:51.160 --> 1:05:55.360
 and getting over the small talk quickly

1:05:55.360 --> 1:05:56.800
 and getting to know them quickly

1:05:56.800 --> 1:05:59.240
 and having a relationship that stands out

1:05:59.240 --> 1:06:03.040
 and then being able to call on them later because of that.

1:06:03.040 --> 1:06:07.120
 And I think that's been because I'm introverted

1:06:07.120 --> 1:06:09.920
 and I, you know, want to poke my eyes out

1:06:09.920 --> 1:06:13.840
 instead of go and do small talk.

1:06:13.840 --> 1:06:16.720
 And so I huddle in a corner with one person

1:06:16.720 --> 1:06:19.600
 and, you know, we talk about aliens or things like that.

1:06:19.600 --> 1:06:23.000
 And so, you know, that's all to say that,

1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:24.440
 you know, having a strong network,

1:06:24.440 --> 1:06:28.200
 I think is really important, but a genuine one.

1:06:28.200 --> 1:06:31.960
 And let's see, other ways to build a rocket company,

1:06:31.960 --> 1:06:33.560
 kind of making sure you're paying attention

1:06:33.560 --> 1:06:35.800
 to the sweeping trends of the industry

1:06:35.800 --> 1:06:37.880
 so everybody just cares about cost

1:06:37.880 --> 1:06:41.480
 and being able to get out ahead of that

1:06:41.480 --> 1:06:44.120
 and even more than we ever thought we'd need to

1:06:44.120 --> 1:06:46.920
 as far as what we needed to price our systems at.

1:06:46.920 --> 1:06:50.200
 You know, people for,

1:06:50.200 --> 1:06:53.000
 since the start of the US space industry,

1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:57.080
 they've been paying 20, 25 million in adjusted dollars

1:06:57.080 --> 1:06:58.160
 for an ion engine.

1:06:58.160 --> 1:07:03.160
 And seeing that now people are going to want to pay 10K

1:07:03.160 --> 1:07:08.160
 for an ion engine and just staying out ahead of that

1:07:08.920 --> 1:07:10.600
 and those kinds of things.

1:07:10.600 --> 1:07:12.400
 So, you know, being out in the industry

1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:15.040
 and talking to as many people as possible.

1:07:15.040 --> 1:07:15.960
 So there's a drive.

1:07:15.960 --> 1:07:18.440
 I mean, I suppose SpaceX really pushed that.

1:07:18.440 --> 1:07:20.240
 Frustrating for me.

1:07:20.240 --> 1:07:22.600
 So SpaceX really pushed this,

1:07:24.880 --> 1:07:26.960
 the application of, I guess, capitalism

1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:28.440
 of driving the price down,

1:07:28.440 --> 1:07:31.800
 of basically forcing people to ask the question,

1:07:31.800 --> 1:07:34.600
 can this be done cheaper?

1:07:35.760 --> 1:07:40.760
 This can lead to like big problems, I would say,

1:07:41.040 --> 1:07:43.080
 in the following sense.

1:07:43.080 --> 1:07:46.200
 I see this in the car industry, for example,

1:07:46.200 --> 1:07:49.480
 that people have,

1:07:49.480 --> 1:07:53.840
 it's such a small margin for profit.

1:07:53.840 --> 1:07:57.120
 Like they've driven the cost of everything down so much

1:07:57.120 --> 1:07:59.880
 that there's literally no room for innovation

1:07:59.880 --> 1:08:01.240
 for taking risks.

1:08:01.240 --> 1:08:04.520
 So like cars, which is funny

1:08:04.520 --> 1:08:07.560
 because not until Tesla, really,

1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:10.520
 which is one of the, in a long, long time,

1:08:10.520 --> 1:08:14.400
 one of the first successful new car companies

1:08:14.400 --> 1:08:16.240
 that's constantly innovating,

1:08:16.240 --> 1:08:19.200
 every other car company is really pouring

1:08:19.200 --> 1:08:21.600
 in terms of their technological innovation.

1:08:21.600 --> 1:08:24.360
 They innovate on design and style and so on,

1:08:25.280 --> 1:08:27.360
 that people fall in love with the look and so on,

1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:29.800
 but it's not really innovation.

1:08:29.800 --> 1:08:31.280
 In terms of the technology in it,

1:08:31.280 --> 1:08:33.360
 it's really boringly the same thing,

1:08:33.360 --> 1:08:35.840
 and they're really afraid of taking risks.

1:08:35.840 --> 1:08:38.520
 And that's a big problem for rocket space, too,

1:08:38.520 --> 1:08:41.240
 is like if you're cutting out costs,

1:08:41.240 --> 1:08:44.120
 you can't afford to innovate, to try out new things,

1:08:44.120 --> 1:08:48.480
 and that's definitely true with ion engines, right?

1:08:51.880 --> 1:08:54.680
 So how do you compete in this space?

1:08:54.680 --> 1:08:57.440
 Do you, by the way, see SpaceX as a competitor?

1:08:57.440 --> 1:08:59.840
 And what do you say in general

1:08:59.840 --> 1:09:01.440
 about the competition in this space?

1:09:01.440 --> 1:09:05.920
 Is it really difficult as a business to compete here?

1:09:05.920 --> 1:09:09.080
 No, I don't see SpaceX as a competitor,

1:09:09.080 --> 1:09:12.960
 and I see them as one day, not too long from now,

1:09:12.960 --> 1:09:14.640
 a customer, hopefully.

1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:18.680
 I mean, to compete against that,

1:09:18.680 --> 1:09:23.080
 I think you just have to do things in an unconventional way.

1:09:23.080 --> 1:09:27.000
 So bringing silicon MEMS manufacturing

1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:30.600
 to propulsion, NASA doesn't make ion engines

1:09:30.600 --> 1:09:34.880
 using a batch mass producible technique.

1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:38.320
 They have one guy that's been making their ion engines

1:09:38.320 --> 1:09:41.760
 for 20 years bespoke pieces of jewelry.

1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:46.760
 So bringing things to what you're trying to innovate

1:09:47.680 --> 1:09:51.080
 to make them, in our case, more cost effective

1:09:51.080 --> 1:09:52.480
 was really key.

1:09:53.520 --> 1:09:56.360
 I like the idea of somebody putting out ion engines

1:09:56.360 --> 1:09:57.520
 on like Etsy.

1:09:57.520 --> 1:10:00.880
 Yeah, my advisor at MIT would,

1:10:00.880 --> 1:10:02.320
 the thruster chip I was holding up,

1:10:02.320 --> 1:10:05.680
 he would wear one as a lapel pin.

1:10:05.680 --> 1:10:08.520
 But in general, just on the topic of SpaceX,

1:10:09.880 --> 1:10:12.520
 2020 has seen some difficult things

1:10:12.520 --> 1:10:14.800
 for human civilization.

1:10:14.800 --> 1:10:17.800
 And it's been a lot of, first of all, it's an election year,

1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:20.520
 there's been a lot of drama and division about that.

1:10:20.520 --> 1:10:24.840
 There's been riots of all different reasons,

1:10:24.840 --> 1:10:28.440
 racial division, there's been obviously a virus

1:10:28.440 --> 1:10:31.440
 that's testing the very fabric of our society.

1:10:31.440 --> 1:10:34.480
 But there's been really, for me at least,

1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:36.960
 super positive things, inspiring things,

1:10:36.960 --> 1:10:41.960
 which is SpaceX and NASA doing the first commercial

1:10:43.320 --> 1:10:47.800
 human flight, launching humans to space

1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:49.600
 and did it twice successfully.

1:10:50.640 --> 1:10:54.520
 What is that, did you get to watch that launch?

1:10:54.520 --> 1:10:57.000
 Did you, what does it make you feel?

1:10:57.960 --> 1:11:00.960
 Do you think this is first days

1:11:00.960 --> 1:11:04.480
 for a new era of space exploration?

1:11:05.600 --> 1:11:06.640
 Yeah, I did watch it.

1:11:06.640 --> 1:11:09.840
 We played it outside on a big screen at our place.

1:11:09.840 --> 1:11:13.520
 And I was a little, they kept saying Bob and Doug,

1:11:13.520 --> 1:11:18.200
 Bob and Doug, and astronauts usually are treated

1:11:19.200 --> 1:11:20.680
 with a little bit more fanfare.

1:11:20.680 --> 1:11:24.000
 So it felt very casual, but maybe that was a good,

1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:26.280
 a good thing, like this is the era

1:11:26.280 --> 1:11:30.160
 of commercial crewed missions.

1:11:30.160 --> 1:11:34.000
 It was a little bit more, what is it?

1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:34.840
 What's his name?

1:11:34.840 --> 1:11:37.360
 Chris Hadfield, like playing guitar.

1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:38.200
 Yeah.

1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:41.160
 It's more, it's a different flavor to it of.

1:11:41.160 --> 1:11:42.560
 Yeah, exactly.

1:11:42.560 --> 1:11:46.120
 More like fun, playful, celebrity type.

1:11:46.120 --> 1:11:47.080
 Yes, exactly.

1:11:47.080 --> 1:11:51.760
 Astronaut versus the aura of the magical

1:11:51.760 --> 1:11:55.440
 sort of heroic element of the single human

1:11:55.440 --> 1:11:56.920
 representing us in space.

1:11:56.920 --> 1:12:00.360
 Yes, I think that's all for the better though.

1:12:00.360 --> 1:12:02.960
 It's so cool that it's such a commonplace thing

1:12:02.960 --> 1:12:04.600
 now that we send.

1:12:04.600 --> 1:12:07.120
 I can't believe that sometimes I'll have to,

1:12:07.960 --> 1:12:10.600
 you don't even realize that astronauts are coming

1:12:10.600 --> 1:12:13.600
 and going all the time, splashing back down.

1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:15.080
 And it's just so common now,

1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:19.080
 but that's quite magical, I think.

1:12:19.080 --> 1:12:20.960
 So yes, we did watch that.

1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:24.760
 I love, love, love that we finally have that capability

1:12:24.760 --> 1:12:27.760
 again to send people to the space station.

1:12:28.840 --> 1:12:32.800
 And it's just really exciting to see the private sector

1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:34.920
 stepping up to fill in where the government

1:12:34.920 --> 1:12:36.200
 has pulled back in the US.

1:12:36.200 --> 1:12:38.400
 And I think pulled back way too soon

1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:42.520
 as far as exploration and science goes.

1:12:42.520 --> 1:12:44.120
 Probably pulled back at the right time

1:12:44.120 --> 1:12:47.920
 for commercial things and getting that started.

1:12:47.920 --> 1:12:51.880
 But I'm really happy that it's even possible

1:12:51.880 --> 1:12:55.800
 to do that with private money and companies.

1:12:55.800 --> 1:12:58.520
 Do you like the kind of the model of competition

1:12:58.520 --> 1:13:01.440
 of NASA funding?

1:13:01.440 --> 1:13:02.520
 I guess that's how it works,

1:13:02.520 --> 1:13:04.320
 is like they're providing quite a bit of money

1:13:04.320 --> 1:13:08.240
 from the government and then private companies compete

1:13:08.240 --> 1:13:12.400
 to be the delivery vehicles for whichever

1:13:12.400 --> 1:13:17.400
 the government missions, like NASA missions.

1:13:17.400 --> 1:13:20.640
 Yes, I think for this type of mission

1:13:20.640 --> 1:13:25.640
 is a little bit kind of straddles commercial and science.

1:13:25.640 --> 1:13:29.400
 So I think it's good, but I do in general feel

1:13:29.400 --> 1:13:34.040
 like we've pulled back too much on NASA's role

1:13:34.040 --> 1:13:36.960
 in the science and exploration part.

1:13:36.960 --> 1:13:40.960
 And I think our pace is too slow there,

1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:42.960
 for my liking, I suppose.

1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:43.800
 What do you mean?

1:13:43.800 --> 1:13:48.520
 Okay, so did you have, I mean, on the cost thing,

1:13:48.520 --> 1:13:52.560
 do you feel like NASA was a little too bureaucratic

1:13:52.560 --> 1:13:57.560
 in a sense, like too slow, too heavy cost wise

1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:00.880
 in their effort, like when they were running things

1:14:00.880 --> 1:14:03.720
 purely without any commercial involvement?

1:14:03.720 --> 1:14:06.780
 So I suppose it's more that I just want

1:14:06.780 --> 1:14:08.720
 the government to fund.

1:14:08.720 --> 1:14:09.560
 I see, yeah.

1:14:09.560 --> 1:14:12.720
 And maybe NASA's not the best organization

1:14:12.720 --> 1:14:15.560
 to do it rapidly.

1:14:15.560 --> 1:14:20.560
 But I think that, again, depending on the goals,

1:14:20.560 --> 1:14:23.480
 we're just kind of at the very starting point

1:14:23.480 --> 1:14:28.480
 of space exploration and science and understanding.

1:14:28.960 --> 1:14:32.320
 So we should be spending more money there and not less.

1:14:32.320 --> 1:14:34.960
 And other countries are starting to spend more and more,

1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:38.140
 and I think we'll fall behind because of that.

1:14:38.140 --> 1:14:41.000
 So you have quite a bit of experience, first of all,

1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:43.720
 starting a company yourself, but also I saw,

1:14:43.720 --> 1:14:46.800
 maybe you can correct me, but you have quite a bit

1:14:46.800 --> 1:14:50.880
 of knowledge of just in general the startup experience

1:14:50.880 --> 1:14:54.400
 of building companies that you've interacted with people.

1:14:54.400 --> 1:14:59.400
 Is there advice that you can give to somebody,

1:14:59.480 --> 1:15:02.220
 to a founder or cofounder who wants to launch

1:15:02.220 --> 1:15:07.220
 and grow a new company and do something big and impactful

1:15:07.840 --> 1:15:08.680
 in this world?

1:15:08.680 --> 1:15:13.680
 Yes, I would say, like I mentioned earlier,

1:15:13.740 --> 1:15:18.740
 but make sure the vision is something that will get you

1:15:19.060 --> 1:15:23.060
 out of bed in the morning and that you can rally

1:15:23.060 --> 1:15:27.180
 other people around you to achieve.

1:15:27.180 --> 1:15:31.100
 Because I see a lot of folks that sort of cared

1:15:31.100 --> 1:15:33.900
 about something or saw a window of opportunity

1:15:33.900 --> 1:15:37.300
 to do something, and startups are hard,

1:15:37.300 --> 1:15:42.300
 and more often than not, just being opportunistic

1:15:42.300 --> 1:15:44.980
 isn't going to be enough to make it through

1:15:44.980 --> 1:15:48.860
 all the really crappy things that are going to happen.

1:15:48.860 --> 1:15:51.300
 So the vision just helps you psychologically

1:15:51.300 --> 1:15:52.820
 to carry through the hardships,

1:15:52.820 --> 1:15:53.660
 for you and the team.

1:15:53.660 --> 1:15:56.180
 Yeah, you and the team, yeah, exactly.

1:15:56.180 --> 1:15:59.100
 To kind of younger people interested in getting

1:15:59.100 --> 1:16:02.240
 into entrepreneurship, I would say stay as close

1:16:02.240 --> 1:16:06.700
 to first principles and fundamentals as you can

1:16:06.700 --> 1:16:11.100
 for as long as you can, because really understanding

1:16:11.100 --> 1:16:13.660
 the problems, if it's something scientific

1:16:13.660 --> 1:16:16.780
 or hardware related, or even if it's not,

1:16:16.780 --> 1:16:20.380
 but having a deep understanding of the problem

1:16:20.380 --> 1:16:22.660
 and the customers and what people care about

1:16:22.660 --> 1:16:26.380
 and how to move something forward is more important

1:16:26.380 --> 1:16:30.480
 than taking all of the entrepreneurship classes

1:16:30.480 --> 1:16:31.620
 in undergrad.

1:16:31.620 --> 1:16:33.400
 So being able to think deeply, yeah.

1:16:33.400 --> 1:16:35.120
 Yeah, exactly.

1:16:35.120 --> 1:16:38.180
 Yeah, have you been surprised about how much pivoting

1:16:38.180 --> 1:16:41.780
 is involved, basically rethinking what you thought

1:16:41.780 --> 1:16:44.260
 initially would be the right direction to go?

1:16:44.260 --> 1:16:46.540
 Or is there, if you think deeply enough,

1:16:46.540 --> 1:16:50.540
 that you can stick in the same direction for long enough?

1:16:50.540 --> 1:16:55.540
 So our guiding star hasn't changed at all,

1:16:56.320 --> 1:16:57.860
 so that's been pretty consistent,

1:16:57.860 --> 1:17:02.860
 but within that, we flip flop on so many things

1:17:02.860 --> 1:17:06.020
 all the time, and to give you one example,

1:17:06.020 --> 1:17:10.220
 it's do you stop and build a first product

1:17:10.220 --> 1:17:14.140
 that's well suited to maybe a smaller,

1:17:14.140 --> 1:17:16.660
 less exciting segment of the market,

1:17:16.660 --> 1:17:21.660
 or do you stay head down and focus on the big swing

1:17:22.940 --> 1:17:25.280
 and trying to hit it out of the park right away?

1:17:25.280 --> 1:17:27.540
 And we've flip flopped between that,

1:17:27.540 --> 1:17:30.240
 and there's not a blanket answer,

1:17:30.240 --> 1:17:33.560
 and there are a lot of factors, but that's a hard one.

1:17:33.560 --> 1:17:38.560
 And I think one other piece for the aspiring founder,

1:17:40.640 --> 1:17:44.700
 spending a lot of time and effort on the culture

1:17:44.700 --> 1:17:47.780
 and people piece is so important

1:17:47.780 --> 1:17:52.060
 and is always an afterthought and something

1:17:52.060 --> 1:17:57.060
 that I haven't really seen the founders or executives

1:17:57.060 --> 1:18:00.860
 or executives at companies purposefully carve out time

1:18:00.860 --> 1:18:04.500
 and acknowledge that, yes, this is going to take

1:18:04.500 --> 1:18:06.500
 a lot of my time and resources,

1:18:06.500 --> 1:18:09.480
 but you see them after the fact trying to repair

1:18:09.480 --> 1:18:14.060
 the bro culture or whatever else is broken at the company.

1:18:14.060 --> 1:18:16.440
 And I think that it's starting to change,

1:18:16.440 --> 1:18:19.580
 but just to be aware of it from the beginning is important.

1:18:19.580 --> 1:18:21.780
 Right, I guess it should be part of the vision

1:18:21.780 --> 1:18:24.180
 of what kind of place you want to create,

1:18:24.180 --> 1:18:28.540
 or what kind of human beings.

1:18:28.540 --> 1:18:31.900
 Yeah, exactly, you can't wait five, 10 years

1:18:31.900 --> 1:18:35.300
 and then just slap an HR person onto trying to fix it.

1:18:35.300 --> 1:18:37.820
 It has to be thoughtful from the beginning.

1:18:37.820 --> 1:18:40.940
 Yeah, don't get me started on HR people.

1:18:43.780 --> 1:18:46.540
 Don't leave HR to HR people, but I'll just leave it at that.

1:18:46.540 --> 1:18:48.540
 You didn't say that, I said it, okay.

1:18:48.540 --> 1:18:53.540
 Yeah, HR's actual HR is really important,

1:18:53.540 --> 1:18:58.540
 is so important, culture is so important.

1:18:58.540 --> 1:19:03.540
 And then I also was surprised, I thought you could say,

1:19:04.040 --> 1:19:06.460
 here will be our culture and our values,

1:19:06.460 --> 1:19:08.900
 and that it was kind of distinct from who I

1:19:08.900 --> 1:19:11.140
 and my co founder were as people,

1:19:11.140 --> 1:19:12.940
 and I was like, no, that's not how that works.

1:19:12.940 --> 1:19:16.480
 We just kind of ooze out our behaviors

1:19:16.480 --> 1:19:18.220
 and then the company grows around that.

1:19:18.220 --> 1:19:22.640
 So you have to do a lot of introspection and self work

1:19:22.640 --> 1:19:24.900
 to not end up with a shitty culture.

1:19:24.900 --> 1:19:27.580
 It's kind of a, it's a relationship,

1:19:27.580 --> 1:19:29.700
 but it's supposed to be a relationship with two people,

1:19:29.700 --> 1:19:31.620
 it's a relationship with many people.

1:19:31.620 --> 1:19:32.440
 Yeah.

1:19:32.440 --> 1:19:35.620
 And you communicate so much indirectly by who you are.

1:19:35.620 --> 1:19:38.260
 You have to be, you have to live it, yeah.

1:19:40.780 --> 1:19:42.420
 As somebody, I think about this a lot

1:19:42.420 --> 1:19:45.300
 because generally I'm full of love

1:19:45.300 --> 1:19:47.100
 and all those kinds of things,

1:19:47.100 --> 1:19:49.940
 but I also get really passionate

1:19:49.940 --> 1:19:54.580
 and when I see somebody in the context of work, especially,

1:19:54.580 --> 1:19:58.420
 when I see somebody who I know can do a much better job

1:19:58.420 --> 1:20:02.980
 and they don't do a great job, I can lose my shit

1:20:02.980 --> 1:20:05.700
 in a way that's like Steve Jobsian.

1:20:06.680 --> 1:20:09.960
 And you have to think about exactly the right way

1:20:09.960 --> 1:20:13.460
 to lose your shit if you're going to, or if at all.

1:20:13.460 --> 1:20:14.900
 You have to really think through that

1:20:14.900 --> 1:20:16.620
 because it sends a big signal.

1:20:16.620 --> 1:20:21.180
 You know, sometimes it's okay, like if you do it deliberately,

1:20:21.180 --> 1:20:23.260
 like if you're going to do it deliberately,

1:20:23.260 --> 1:20:24.260
 if you're going to say like,

1:20:24.260 --> 1:20:26.780
 I'm going to be the kind of person that allows this

1:20:26.780 --> 1:20:27.940
 and pays the cost of it,

1:20:27.940 --> 1:20:30.800
 but you can't just think it's not gonna have a cost.

1:20:30.800 --> 1:20:33.480
 Yes, this was like the first thing I worked on

1:20:33.480 --> 1:20:38.480
 with my leadership coach was how not to just snap at people

1:20:39.660 --> 1:20:41.660
 when they were being an idiot.

1:20:41.660 --> 1:20:46.660
 And first I got really good at apologizing.

1:20:46.660 --> 1:20:49.700
 That was the first step because it was going to take longer

1:20:49.700 --> 1:20:51.820
 to fix the behavior.

1:20:51.820 --> 1:20:54.980
 And then she, I'm actually a lot better at it now

1:20:54.980 --> 1:20:56.140
 and it started with things.

1:20:56.140 --> 1:20:58.880
 She's like, every time you walk through a doorway,

1:20:58.880 --> 1:21:03.340
 think, you know, calm and take breaths before responding.

1:21:03.340 --> 1:21:05.740
 And there were all sorts of these little things we did

1:21:05.740 --> 1:21:08.620
 and it was mostly just changing the habit.

1:21:08.620 --> 1:21:13.180
 Yeah, oh boy, it's a long road.

1:21:13.180 --> 1:21:18.180
 Okay, so people love it and we talk about books.

1:21:18.180 --> 1:21:21.660
 Is there books, maybe three or so technical fiction,

1:21:21.660 --> 1:21:24.700
 philosophical that had an impact on your life

1:21:24.700 --> 1:21:27.460
 and you might recommend and for each,

1:21:27.460 --> 1:21:30.660
 is there an idea or so that you take away from it?

1:21:31.540 --> 1:21:36.540
 Yes, so I've been a voracious reader all my life

1:21:36.540 --> 1:21:40.700
 and I'm always reading like three or four or five books

1:21:40.700 --> 1:21:45.700
 at a time and now I use Audible a lot too

1:21:46.380 --> 1:21:48.580
 and you know, podcasts and things like that.

1:21:50.020 --> 1:21:54.340
 So I think the first one that stands out to me is 10,

1:21:54.340 --> 1:21:57.700
 it's a novel, Tender is the Night by Fitzgerald.

1:21:57.700 --> 1:22:01.180
 And I read it when I was much younger

1:22:01.180 --> 1:22:03.700
 but I went back and read it recently and it's not that good.

1:22:03.700 --> 1:22:07.940
 So I'm not sure why it has like such an important place

1:22:07.940 --> 1:22:12.940
 in my literary history but I love Fitzgerald as an author

1:22:13.380 --> 1:22:17.380
 because he's very like flowery prose

1:22:17.380 --> 1:22:21.220
 that I can just picture what he's saying

1:22:21.220 --> 1:22:24.860
 but he does it in such a creative way.

1:22:24.860 --> 1:22:26.740
 I remember that one in particular

1:22:26.740 --> 1:22:29.300
 because I read a ton as a kid too

1:22:29.300 --> 1:22:33.980
 but it kind of set me, it was like the beginning of my adult

1:22:33.980 --> 1:22:38.500
 reading life and getting into classics

1:22:38.500 --> 1:22:43.500
 and I kind of, I do feel like they seem intimidating maybe

1:22:44.740 --> 1:22:47.980
 and then I realized that they're all just like love stories.

1:22:50.260 --> 1:22:51.260
 So.

1:22:51.260 --> 1:22:53.140
 Yeah, isn't everything a love story?

1:22:53.140 --> 1:22:54.460
 Yeah, it's really.

1:22:54.460 --> 1:22:55.300
 At the bottom.

1:22:55.300 --> 1:22:57.100
 Even, you know, I don't know.

1:22:57.100 --> 1:23:02.100
 I was surprised that even like a lot of the Russian authors,

1:23:02.540 --> 1:23:04.740
 you know, they're all just love stories.

1:23:04.740 --> 1:23:05.900
 We're humans are pretty simple.

1:23:05.900 --> 1:23:08.460
 There's not much to worry, there's not much to work with.

1:23:08.460 --> 1:23:09.620
 So I think maybe that was it.

1:23:09.620 --> 1:23:12.780
 It made like that whole world less intimidating to me

1:23:12.780 --> 1:23:17.100
 and cemented my love for reading.

1:23:17.100 --> 1:23:18.740
 People should have just approached the classics

1:23:18.740 --> 1:23:20.620
 like there's probably a love story in here.

1:23:20.620 --> 1:23:21.460
 Chick flicks, yeah.

1:23:21.460 --> 1:23:24.580
 So somehow it boils down to a chick flick.

1:23:24.580 --> 1:23:27.500
 So just relax and enjoy the ride.

1:23:27.500 --> 1:23:28.500
 And then.

1:23:28.500 --> 1:23:29.340
 So what else?

1:23:30.420 --> 1:23:33.860
 Changing gears quite a bit.

1:23:33.860 --> 1:23:35.900
 The Beginning of Infinity, do you know it?

1:23:35.900 --> 1:23:37.460
 By David Deutsch.

1:23:37.460 --> 1:23:41.380
 So he's a physicist at Cambridge or Oxford.

1:23:41.380 --> 1:23:45.060
 And so I was introduced like more formally

1:23:45.060 --> 1:23:47.620
 to a lot of the ideas, like a lot of the things

1:23:47.620 --> 1:23:52.460
 we've talked about, he has a lot more like formalism

1:23:52.460 --> 1:23:55.220
 and physics rigor around.

1:23:55.220 --> 1:23:59.020
 And so I got introduced to, you know, more like jargon

1:23:59.020 --> 1:24:01.060
 of how to think about some of these ideas,

1:24:02.780 --> 1:24:07.780
 you know, like memes and, you know, DNA as ultimate meme,

1:24:10.580 --> 1:24:15.580
 the concept of infinity and objective beauty.

1:24:16.060 --> 1:24:19.220
 But he has a really strong grounding in physics.

1:24:19.220 --> 1:24:20.060
 And then.

1:24:20.060 --> 1:24:22.660
 There's a rigorous way of talking about these like big.

1:24:22.660 --> 1:24:23.500
 Yeah.

1:24:23.500 --> 1:24:28.140
 So that was very mind opening to me to read that.

1:24:28.140 --> 1:24:30.740
 But it also, I think it's probably part of why

1:24:30.740 --> 1:24:33.620
 I ended up marrying my husband is related to that book.

1:24:33.620 --> 1:24:36.420
 And then I've had some other really great connections

1:24:36.420 --> 1:24:40.020
 with people because I had read it and so had they.

1:24:40.020 --> 1:24:43.020
 I like how you turned that, even that book

1:24:43.020 --> 1:24:44.260
 into a love story.

1:24:44.260 --> 1:24:45.660
 I did, oh no.

1:24:45.660 --> 1:24:46.500
 Somehow.

1:24:46.500 --> 1:24:47.740
 No, it's good, it's good.

1:24:47.740 --> 1:24:49.340
 Your robot has a heart.

1:24:49.340 --> 1:24:50.580
 Exactly.

1:24:50.580 --> 1:24:55.580
 And okay, the third series is, it's just, it's Harry Potter.

1:24:57.580 --> 1:24:59.700
 Of course, which somehow connects to,

1:24:59.700 --> 1:25:01.140
 I haven't read Harry Potter.

1:25:01.140 --> 1:25:01.980
 I'm really sorry.

1:25:01.980 --> 1:25:02.820
 Oh no.

1:25:02.820 --> 1:25:04.660
 Forgive me, forgive me.

1:25:05.540 --> 1:25:08.260
 But I've read Tolkien, but just Harry Potter,

1:25:08.260 --> 1:25:09.860
 just haven't gotten to it.

1:25:09.860 --> 1:25:12.460
 But your company name is somehow I think

1:25:12.460 --> 1:25:13.300
 connected to Harry Potter, right?

1:25:13.300 --> 1:25:14.140
 Yes.

1:25:14.140 --> 1:25:15.380
 I think I heard this.

1:25:15.380 --> 1:25:20.380
 My, I always feel like I have to justify my fandom.

1:25:22.660 --> 1:25:25.060
 The first three books came out when I was 10.

1:25:25.060 --> 1:25:28.980
 So I went along this journey with Harry, age wise.

1:25:28.980 --> 1:25:33.980
 And I read them all like nine or 10 times, all seven books.

1:25:34.900 --> 1:25:39.380
 And I think anything that just keeps you reading

1:25:39.380 --> 1:25:41.540
 is what's important.

1:25:41.540 --> 1:25:44.580
 And I have lulls where I don't feel like reading anything.

1:25:44.580 --> 1:25:49.580
 So I'll reread a Harry Potter or a trashy detective novel

1:25:50.580 --> 1:25:52.340
 or something, and I don't really care.

1:25:52.340 --> 1:25:55.100
 And that's why I mentioned Harry Potter

1:25:55.100 --> 1:25:58.620
 because whatever just keeps me reading,

1:25:58.620 --> 1:25:59.700
 I think is important.

1:25:59.700 --> 1:26:02.820
 And it was a big part of my life growing up.

1:26:02.820 --> 1:26:07.820
 And then yes, Axion, the official story of the naming

1:26:09.060 --> 1:26:12.900
 of the company is that Axion is like a concatenation

1:26:12.900 --> 1:26:15.380
 of accelerate and ion.

1:26:15.380 --> 1:26:18.820
 But it actually came from accio, the summoning charm.

1:26:18.820 --> 1:26:21.500
 And then we just added an N and it was perfect.

1:26:22.500 --> 1:26:23.700
 What's the summoning charm?

1:26:23.700 --> 1:26:25.460
 It's one of the spells in Harry Potter.

1:26:25.460 --> 1:26:30.460
 Yeah, probably most notably Harry uses it

1:26:31.740 --> 1:26:35.420
 to summon his broomstick out of his dorm room

1:26:35.420 --> 1:26:37.820
 when he's battling a dragon somewhere else.

1:26:37.820 --> 1:26:40.180
 So he says the spell and the broomstick comes to him.

1:26:40.180 --> 1:26:43.020
 So summoning in that way.

1:26:43.020 --> 1:26:44.740
 Okay, there we go.

1:26:44.740 --> 1:26:45.740
 This is brilliant.

1:26:45.740 --> 1:26:48.820
 So the big thing is that it's something

1:26:48.820 --> 1:26:52.820
 that you've carry with, it's like your safe place

1:26:52.820 --> 1:26:55.300
 you return to something like the Harry Potter.

1:26:55.300 --> 1:26:59.980
 That, I reread them still, whatever keeps me reading

1:26:59.980 --> 1:27:02.980
 I think is the most important thing.

1:27:02.980 --> 1:27:03.820
 Okay, I got it.

1:27:03.820 --> 1:27:07.660
 So I'm actually the same way in terms of the habit of it.

1:27:07.660 --> 1:27:12.620
 It's important to just keep reading.

1:27:12.620 --> 1:27:16.620
 But I have found myself struggling a little bit too

1:27:16.620 --> 1:27:19.140
 because I listen to a lot of audio books now.

1:27:19.140 --> 1:27:24.140
 I've struggled to then switch back to reading seriously.

1:27:26.020 --> 1:27:27.540
 It's just I read so many papers,

1:27:27.540 --> 1:27:28.980
 I read so many other things.

1:27:28.980 --> 1:27:30.620
 It feels like if I'm gonna sit down

1:27:30.620 --> 1:27:33.580
 and have the time to actually focus on the reading

1:27:33.580 --> 1:27:36.740
 I should be reading like blog posts or papers

1:27:36.740 --> 1:27:38.940
 or more condensed kind of things.

1:27:38.940 --> 1:27:42.700
 But there's a huge value to just reading long form still.

1:27:42.700 --> 1:27:47.460
 Yeah, and my husband was never that into fiction

1:27:47.460 --> 1:27:50.580
 but then someone told him or he heard,

1:27:51.540 --> 1:27:55.140
 you learn a lot of empathy through reading fiction.

1:27:55.140 --> 1:27:56.780
 So you could think of it that way.

1:27:56.780 --> 1:27:58.700
 Well, yeah, that's kind of what, yeah, yeah.

1:27:58.700 --> 1:28:00.620
 And it's also fiction is a nice,

1:28:01.460 --> 1:28:06.340
 unlike not less so with nonfiction is a chance to travel.

1:28:06.340 --> 1:28:08.260
 I see it as kind of traveling.

1:28:08.260 --> 1:28:11.340
 As you go to this other world and it's nice

1:28:11.340 --> 1:28:12.700
 because it's like much more efficient.

1:28:12.700 --> 1:28:14.140
 You don't have to get on a plane,

1:28:14.140 --> 1:28:17.540
 and you get to meet all kinds of new people.

1:28:17.540 --> 1:28:19.860
 It's like people say they love traveling

1:28:19.860 --> 1:28:21.300
 and I say I love traveling too.

1:28:21.300 --> 1:28:23.140
 I just, yeah, read fiction.

1:28:23.140 --> 1:28:28.140
 I told my three year old that that was why we read so much

1:28:29.540 --> 1:28:32.540
 because we see the places in our mind

1:28:32.540 --> 1:28:36.180
 and I'm like, it's basically like we're watching a movie.

1:28:36.180 --> 1:28:37.020
 That's how it feels.

1:28:37.020 --> 1:28:39.580
 And she's like, I prefer watching Frozen with popcorn,

1:28:39.580 --> 1:28:41.980
 was her response that.

1:28:41.980 --> 1:28:43.540
 Okay, well, you're three.

1:28:43.540 --> 1:28:45.260
 That's a good point.

1:28:45.260 --> 1:28:47.620
 But yeah, there's some power to the imagination, right?

1:28:47.620 --> 1:28:49.460
 That's not just like watching a movie

1:28:49.460 --> 1:28:53.260
 because something about our imagination

1:28:53.260 --> 1:28:56.740
 because it's the words in the world that's painted

1:28:56.740 --> 1:29:00.100
 somehow mixing in with our own understanding

1:29:00.100 --> 1:29:02.580
 of our own hopes and dreams, our fears.

1:29:02.580 --> 1:29:03.820
 It like mixes up in there

1:29:03.820 --> 1:29:07.660
 and the way we can build up that world from just the page.

1:29:07.660 --> 1:29:10.260
 Yeah, you're really creating the world

1:29:10.260 --> 1:29:13.340
 just with the prompts from the book, right?

1:29:13.340 --> 1:29:15.900
 Yeah, that's different than watching a movie.

1:29:15.900 --> 1:29:17.380
 Yeah, which is why it hurts sometimes

1:29:17.380 --> 1:29:19.220
 to watch the movie version

1:29:19.220 --> 1:29:23.660
 and then you're like, that's not at all how I imagined it.

1:29:23.660 --> 1:29:26.740
 Well, we kind of brought this up in terms of

1:29:29.140 --> 1:29:31.700
 depending on what the goals are.

1:29:31.700 --> 1:29:35.060
 Let me ask the big, you're friends with Manolis,

1:29:35.060 --> 1:29:36.620
 he's obsessed with this question.

1:29:36.620 --> 1:29:38.460
 So let me ask the big ridiculous question

1:29:38.460 --> 1:29:40.540
 about the meaning of life.

1:29:41.820 --> 1:29:44.140
 Do you ever think about this one?

1:29:44.140 --> 1:29:49.140
 Do you ever ponder the reason we're here?

1:29:49.340 --> 1:29:52.860
 Descends as the vapes on this spinning ball

1:29:52.860 --> 1:29:54.060
 in the middle of nowhere?

1:29:54.060 --> 1:29:57.620
 Yeah, I don't think one ends up

1:29:57.620 --> 1:29:59.820
 in the field of space propulsion

1:29:59.820 --> 1:30:04.460
 without thinking of these existential questions.

1:30:04.460 --> 1:30:05.780
 Yeah, all the time.

1:30:05.780 --> 1:30:07.220
 Or builds a business.

1:30:07.220 --> 1:30:09.540
 Yeah, I know, right?

1:30:09.540 --> 1:30:12.900
 Yeah, we've touched on a lot of the different pieces

1:30:12.900 --> 1:30:13.820
 of this, I think.

1:30:13.820 --> 1:30:18.820
 So I have a bunch of thoughts.

1:30:18.860 --> 1:30:23.260
 I do think that the goal isn't,

1:30:23.260 --> 1:30:28.260
 the meaning isn't anymore just to be like a Petri dish

1:30:28.260 --> 1:30:31.060
 of bacteria that reproduces

1:30:31.060 --> 1:30:36.060
 and where survival and reproduction are the main objectives.

1:30:36.660 --> 1:30:40.460
 And maybe it's because now we're able to answer these,

1:30:40.460 --> 1:30:42.500
 ask those questions.

1:30:42.500 --> 1:30:44.900
 That's maybe the turning point.

1:30:45.900 --> 1:30:49.540
 And instead, I think it's really the pursuit

1:30:49.540 --> 1:30:52.060
 and generation of knowledge.

1:30:52.060 --> 1:30:56.860
 And so if we're taken out by an asteroid or something,

1:30:56.860 --> 1:31:01.860
 I think that it will have been a meaningful endeavor

1:31:03.660 --> 1:31:06.860
 if somehow our knowledge about the universe

1:31:06.860 --> 1:31:11.860
 is preserved somehow and the next civilization

1:31:12.620 --> 1:31:14.780
 isn't starting over again.

1:31:16.340 --> 1:31:21.340
 So that's, I always, yeah, I resonate with that.

1:31:21.860 --> 1:31:25.300
 I always loved the mission of Google from the early days

1:31:25.300 --> 1:31:28.660
 of making the world's sort of information

1:31:28.660 --> 1:31:30.660
 and knowledge searchable.

1:31:30.660 --> 1:31:31.700
 I always loved that idea.

1:31:31.700 --> 1:31:35.660
 I always loved, I was donated as people should to Wikipedia.

1:31:37.020 --> 1:31:38.500
 I just love Wikipedia.

1:31:38.500 --> 1:31:43.340
 I feel like it's the, that's one of the greatest

1:31:43.340 --> 1:31:46.340
 accomplishments of just a humanity of us together,

1:31:46.340 --> 1:31:48.620
 especially Wikipedia and this opens like

1:31:48.620 --> 1:31:50.140
 in this open community way,

1:31:50.140 --> 1:31:52.620
 putting together different knowledge is like,

1:31:52.620 --> 1:31:53.940
 on everything we've talked about today,

1:31:53.940 --> 1:31:57.540
 I'm sure there's a Wikipedia page about ion engines

1:31:57.540 --> 1:31:59.500
 and I'm sure it's pretty good.

1:31:59.500 --> 1:32:02.420
 Like, it's, I don't know, that's incredible.

1:32:02.420 --> 1:32:05.180
 And obviously that can be preserved pretty efficiently,

1:32:05.180 --> 1:32:06.540
 at least Wikipedia.

1:32:06.540 --> 1:32:09.260
 I don't know, you'll be like, human civilization

1:32:09.260 --> 1:32:11.500
 is all like burning up in flames

1:32:11.500 --> 1:32:14.300
 as there's this one USB drive slowly traveling out.

1:32:14.300 --> 1:32:15.140
 Yeah, I know, exactly.

1:32:15.140 --> 1:32:16.420
 With Wikipedia on it.

1:32:16.420 --> 1:32:17.700
 Yep.

1:32:17.700 --> 1:32:20.460
 That's on, from the beginning of our chat,

1:32:20.460 --> 1:32:22.420
 that one lonely spacecraft.

1:32:22.420 --> 1:32:24.940
 It just needs Wikipedia.

1:32:24.940 --> 1:32:28.700
 And then it will have been a civilization well spent.

1:32:28.700 --> 1:32:30.900
 So pushing that knowledge along.

1:32:30.900 --> 1:32:31.740
 Yeah.

1:32:31.740 --> 1:32:35.060
 Through like one little discovery at a time

1:32:35.060 --> 1:32:39.100
 is one of, is a core aspect to the meaning of it all.

1:32:39.100 --> 1:32:42.860
 Yes, and I also, I haven't yet figured out

1:32:42.860 --> 1:32:46.740
 what the connection, you know, an explanation

1:32:46.740 --> 1:32:48.940
 I'm happy with yet for how it's connected,

1:32:48.940 --> 1:32:53.940
 but evolving beyond just the survival piece too,

1:32:55.300 --> 1:32:59.460
 I think like we touched on the emotional aspect,

1:32:59.460 --> 1:33:04.180
 something in there about cooperation and, you know, love.

1:33:04.180 --> 1:33:08.900
 And so I, in my day to day that just boils down to,

1:33:08.900 --> 1:33:11.340
 you know, the pursuit of knowledge

1:33:11.340 --> 1:33:16.340
 or improving the human condition and being kind.

1:33:16.500 --> 1:33:18.140
 Love and knowledge.

1:33:18.140 --> 1:33:19.860
 Yeah, exactly.

1:33:19.860 --> 1:33:23.740
 So I'm pretty at peace with that as the meaning right now.

1:33:23.740 --> 1:33:24.580
 Makes sense to me.

1:33:24.580 --> 1:33:27.980
 While you work on spacecraft propulsion.

1:33:27.980 --> 1:33:29.820
 Yes, exactly.

1:33:29.820 --> 1:33:32.100
 Like literal rocket science.

1:33:32.100 --> 1:33:34.100
 Natalia, this is an amazing conversation.

1:33:34.100 --> 1:33:36.740
 You work on such an exciting engineering field.

1:33:36.740 --> 1:33:40.860
 And I think this is like what 20th, 21st century

1:33:40.860 --> 1:33:43.140
 will be remembered for is space exploration.

1:33:43.140 --> 1:33:46.820
 So this is super exciting space that you're working on.

1:33:46.820 --> 1:33:48.860
 So, and thank you so much

1:33:48.860 --> 1:33:50.940

 from Carl Sagan.

1:34:24.300 --> 1:34:28.860
 All civilizations become either space faring or extinct.

1:34:28.860 --> 1:34:48.860
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
