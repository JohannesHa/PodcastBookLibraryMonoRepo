00:00.000 --> 00:03.360
 The following is a conversation with Paola Arlotta.

00:03.360 --> 00:06.380
 She's a professor of stem cell and regenerative biology

00:06.380 --> 00:09.760
 at Harvard University and is interested in understanding

00:09.760 --> 00:13.160
 the molecular laws that govern the birth, differentiation,

00:13.160 --> 00:16.600
 and assembly of the human brain's cerebral cortex.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.400
 She explores the complexity of the brain

00:18.400 --> 00:21.000
 by studying and engineering elements

00:21.000 --> 00:22.880
 of how the brain develops.

00:22.880 --> 00:25.640
 This was a fascinating conversation to me.

00:25.640 --> 00:28.560
 It's part of the Artificial Intelligence podcast.

00:28.560 --> 00:30.600

 or simply connect with me on Twitter

00:35.800 --> 00:39.960
 at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

00:39.960 --> 00:43.120
 And I'd like to give a special thank you to Amy Jeffress

00:43.120 --> 00:45.560
 for her support of the podcast on Patreon.

00:45.560 --> 00:47.660
 She's an artist and you should definitely check out

00:47.660 --> 00:52.660
 her Instagram at lovetruthgood, three beautiful words.

00:52.760 --> 00:55.640
 Your support means a lot and inspires me

00:55.640 --> 00:57.720
 to keep the series going.

00:57.720 --> 01:01.740
 And now here's my conversation with Paola Arlotta.

01:03.120 --> 01:05.320
 You studied the development of the human brain

01:05.320 --> 01:06.720
 for many years.

01:06.720 --> 01:10.520
 So let me ask you an out of the box question first.

01:11.480 --> 01:14.600
 How likely is it that there's intelligent life out there

01:14.600 --> 01:17.160
 in the universe outside of earth

01:17.160 --> 01:19.320
 with something like the human brain?

01:19.320 --> 01:20.760
 So I can put it another way.

01:20.760 --> 01:24.320
 How unlikely is the human brain?

01:24.320 --> 01:28.320
 How difficult is it to build a thing

01:28.320 --> 01:30.360
 through the evolutionary process?

01:30.360 --> 01:32.480
 Well, it has happened here, right?

01:32.480 --> 01:33.320
 On this planet.

01:33.320 --> 01:34.160
 Once, yes.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.000
 Once.

01:36.320 --> 01:39.940
 So that simply tells you that it could, of course,

01:39.940 --> 01:42.120
 happen again other places.

01:42.120 --> 01:44.080
 It's only a matter of probability.

01:44.080 --> 01:46.560
 What the probability that you would get a brain

01:46.560 --> 01:51.200
 like the ones that we have, like the human brain.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.960
 So how difficult is it to make the human brain?

01:53.960 --> 01:57.880
 It's pretty difficult, but most importantly,

01:59.040 --> 02:00.920
 I guess we know very little

02:00.920 --> 02:04.400
 about how this process really happens.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.280
 And there is a reason for that,

02:06.280 --> 02:09.080
 actually multiple reasons for that.

02:09.080 --> 02:13.280
 Most of what we know about how the mammalian brain,

02:13.280 --> 02:17.000
 so the brain of mammals develop comes from studying

02:17.000 --> 02:20.440
 in labs other brains, not our own brain,

02:20.440 --> 02:22.520
 the brain of mice, for example.

02:22.520 --> 02:25.360
 But if I showed you a picture of a mouse brain,

02:25.360 --> 02:28.320
 and then you put it next to a picture of a human brain,

02:28.320 --> 02:31.080
 they don't look at all like each other.

02:31.080 --> 02:32.960
 So they're very different.

02:32.960 --> 02:36.200
 And therefore there is a limit to what you can learn

02:36.200 --> 02:37.880
 about how the human brain is made

02:37.880 --> 02:39.720
 by studying the mouse brain.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.240
 There is a huge value in studying the mouse brain.

02:43.240 --> 02:45.000
 There are many things that we have learned,

02:45.000 --> 02:46.520
 but it's not the same thing.

02:46.520 --> 02:49.120
 So in having studied the human brain,

02:49.120 --> 02:51.360
 or through the mouse and through other methodologies

02:51.360 --> 02:54.640
 that we'll talk about, do you have a sense?

02:54.640 --> 02:57.440
 I mean, you're one of the experts in the world.

02:57.440 --> 03:01.040
 How much do you feel you know about the brain

03:01.040 --> 03:05.280
 and how often do you find yourself

03:05.280 --> 03:07.720
 in awe of this mysterious thing?

03:07.720 --> 03:12.120
 Yeah, you pretty much find yourself in awe all the time.

03:12.120 --> 03:15.240
 It's an amazing process.

03:15.240 --> 03:17.840
 It's a process by which,

03:17.840 --> 03:20.640
 by means that we don't fully understand,

03:20.640 --> 03:23.560
 at the very beginning of embryogenesis,

03:23.560 --> 03:26.240
 the structure called the neural tube,

03:26.240 --> 03:28.720
 literally self assembles.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.360
 And it happens in an embryo

03:30.360 --> 03:33.680
 and it can happen also from stem cells in a dish.

03:33.680 --> 03:34.840
 Okay.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.840
 And then from there,

03:36.840 --> 03:39.800
 these stem cells that are present within the neural tube

03:39.800 --> 03:42.200
 give rise to all of the thousands and thousands

03:42.200 --> 03:45.040
 of different cell types that are present in the brain

03:45.040 --> 03:46.480
 through time, right?

03:46.480 --> 03:50.920
 With the interesting, very intriguing, interesting

03:50.920 --> 03:54.880
 observation is that the time that it takes

03:54.880 --> 03:58.760
 for the human brain to be made, it's human time.

03:58.760 --> 04:02.120
 Meaning that for me and you,

04:02.120 --> 04:05.240
 it took almost nine months of gestation to build the brain

04:05.240 --> 04:08.680
 and then another 20 years of learning postnatally

04:08.680 --> 04:09.960
 to get the brain that we have today

04:09.960 --> 04:12.080
 that allows us to this conversation.

04:12.080 --> 04:17.080
 A mouse takes 20 days or so for an embryo to be born.

04:19.560 --> 04:23.760
 And so the brain is built in a much shorter period of time.

04:23.760 --> 04:27.160
 And the beauty of it is that if you take mouse stem cells

04:27.160 --> 04:28.880
 and you put them in a culture dish,

04:29.840 --> 04:33.280
 the brain organoid that you get from a mouse

04:33.280 --> 04:37.600
 is formed faster than if you took human stem cells

04:37.600 --> 04:39.080
 and put them in the dish

04:39.080 --> 04:41.960
 and let them make a human brain organoid.

04:41.960 --> 04:45.520
 So the very developmental process is...

04:45.520 --> 04:48.200
 Controlled by the speed of the species.

04:49.040 --> 04:54.040
 Which means it's on purpose, it's not accidental

04:54.040 --> 04:58.320
 or there is something in that temporal...

04:58.320 --> 05:01.440
 It's very, exactly, that is very important

05:01.440 --> 05:04.000
 for us to get the brain we have.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.080
 And we can speculate for why that is.

05:08.080 --> 05:11.560
 You know, it takes us a long time as human beings

05:11.560 --> 05:14.520
 after we're born to learn all the things

05:14.520 --> 05:17.920
 that we have to learn to have the adult brain.

05:17.920 --> 05:20.120
 It's actually 20 years, think about it.

05:20.120 --> 05:23.400
 From when a baby is born to when a teenager

05:23.400 --> 05:27.160
 goes through puberty to adults, it's a long time.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.240
 Do you think you can maybe talk through

05:30.240 --> 05:35.040
 the first few months and then on to the first 20 years

05:35.040 --> 05:37.560
 and then for the rest of their lives?

05:37.560 --> 05:41.080
 What is the development of the human brain look like?

05:41.080 --> 05:42.480
 What are the different stages?

05:42.480 --> 05:46.720
 Yeah, at the beginning, you have to build a brain, right?

05:46.720 --> 05:48.840
 And the brain is made of cells.

05:48.840 --> 05:49.760
 What's the very beginning?

05:49.760 --> 05:52.000
 Which beginning are we talking about?

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
 In the embryo, as the embryo is developing in the womb,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.520
 in addition to making all of the other tissues

05:58.520 --> 06:02.040
 of the embryo, the muscle, the heart, the blood,

06:02.040 --> 06:04.960
 the embryo is also building the brain.

06:04.960 --> 06:08.440
 And it builds from a very simple structure

06:08.440 --> 06:11.200
 called the neural tube, which is basically nothing

06:11.200 --> 06:14.760
 but a tube of cells that spans sort of the length

06:14.760 --> 06:18.480
 of the embryo from the head all the way to the tail,

06:18.480 --> 06:19.920
 let's say, of the embryo.

06:20.800 --> 06:25.520
 And then over in human beings, over many months of gestation

06:25.520 --> 06:30.280
 from that neural tube, which contains stem cell

06:30.280 --> 06:35.120
 like cells of the brain, you will make many, many

06:35.120 --> 06:36.960
 other building blocks of the brain.

06:36.960 --> 06:40.160
 So all of the other cell types, because there are many,

06:40.160 --> 06:43.040
 many different types of cells in the brain

06:43.040 --> 06:46.600
 that will form specific structures of the brain.

06:46.600 --> 06:49.760
 So you can think about embryonic development of the brain

06:49.760 --> 06:51.600
 as just the time in which you are making

06:51.600 --> 06:54.400
 the building blocks, the cells.

06:54.400 --> 06:57.600
 Are the stem cells relatively homogeneous, like uniform,

06:57.600 --> 06:59.440
 or are they all different types?

06:59.440 --> 07:00.280
 It's a very good question.

07:00.280 --> 07:01.240
 It's exactly how it works.

07:01.240 --> 07:04.160
 You start with a more homogeneous,

07:04.160 --> 07:09.160
 perhaps more multipotent type of stem cell.

07:09.160 --> 07:10.000
 With multipotent.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.520
 With multipotent it means that it has the potential

07:13.520 --> 07:17.200
 to make many, many different types of other cells.

07:17.200 --> 07:20.200
 And then with time, these progenitors become

07:20.200 --> 07:22.840
 more heterogeneous, which means more diverse.

07:22.840 --> 07:26.200
 There are gonna be many different types of the stem cells.

07:26.200 --> 07:30.080
 And also they will give rise to progeny to other cells

07:30.080 --> 07:32.880
 that are not stem cells, that are specific cells

07:32.880 --> 07:34.200
 of the brain that are very different

07:34.200 --> 07:35.880
 from the mother stem cell.

07:35.880 --> 07:38.880
 And now you think about this process of making cells

07:38.880 --> 07:41.560
 from the stem cells over many, many months

07:41.560 --> 07:43.840
 of development for humans.

07:43.840 --> 07:46.200
 And what you're doing, you're building the cells

07:46.200 --> 07:48.240
 that physically make the brain,

07:48.240 --> 07:52.440
 and then you arrange them in specific structures

07:52.440 --> 07:55.480
 that are present in the final brain.

07:55.480 --> 07:58.720
 So you can think about the embryonic development

07:58.720 --> 08:02.160
 of the brain as the time where you're building the bricks,

08:02.160 --> 08:05.560
 you're putting the bricks together to form buildings,

08:05.560 --> 08:08.160
 structures, regions of the brain.

08:08.160 --> 08:10.400
 And where you make the connections

08:10.400 --> 08:13.080
 between these many different type of cells,

08:13.080 --> 08:15.280
 especially nerve cells, neurons, right?

08:15.280 --> 08:19.280
 That transmit action potentials and electricity.

08:19.280 --> 08:21.360
 I've heard you also say somewhere, I think,

08:21.360 --> 08:22.320
 correct me if I'm wrong,

08:22.320 --> 08:25.160
 that the order of the way this builds matters.

08:25.160 --> 08:26.080
 Oh yes.

08:26.080 --> 08:29.920
 If you are an engineer and you think about development,

08:29.920 --> 08:34.920
 you can think of it as, well, I could also take all the cells

08:35.040 --> 08:38.000
 and bring them all together into a brain in the end.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.360
 But development is much more than that.

08:40.360 --> 08:43.920
 So the cells are made in a very specific order

08:43.920 --> 08:47.440
 that subserve the final product that you need to get.

08:47.440 --> 08:49.920
 And so, for example, all of the nerve cells,

08:49.920 --> 08:52.240
 the neurons are made first,

08:52.240 --> 08:54.440
 and all of the supportive cells of the neurons,

08:54.440 --> 08:56.840
 like the glia, is made later.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.440
 And there is a reason for that

08:58.440 --> 09:02.160
 because they have to assemble together in specific ways.

09:02.160 --> 09:03.400
 But you also may say, well,

09:03.400 --> 09:05.800
 why don't we just put them all together in the end?

09:05.800 --> 09:09.000
 It's because as they develop next to each other,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.360
 they influence their own development.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.280
 So it's a different thing for a glia

09:13.280 --> 09:15.480
 to be made alone in a dish,

09:15.480 --> 09:19.440
 than a glia cell be made in a developing embryo

09:19.440 --> 09:21.400
 with all these other cells around it

09:21.400 --> 09:23.760
 that produce all these other signals.

09:23.760 --> 09:25.960
 First of all, that's mind blowing,

09:25.960 --> 09:27.880
 this development process.

09:27.880 --> 09:29.800
 From my perspective in artificial intelligence,

09:29.800 --> 09:33.480
 you often think of how incredible the final product is,

09:33.480 --> 09:35.200
 the final product, the brain.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.440
 But you're making me realize that the final product

09:38.440 --> 09:42.080
 is just, the beautiful thing

09:42.080 --> 09:44.480
 is the actual development process.

09:44.480 --> 09:49.480
 Do we know the code that drives that development?

09:51.160 --> 09:52.000
 Yeah.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.880
 Do we have any sense?

09:53.880 --> 09:55.800
 First of all, thank you for saying

09:55.800 --> 09:59.320
 that it's really the formation of the brain.

09:59.320 --> 10:00.680
 It's really its development.

10:00.680 --> 10:05.120
 It is this incredibly choreographed dance

10:05.120 --> 10:07.480
 that happens the same way every time

10:07.480 --> 10:10.560
 each one of us builds the brain, right?

10:10.560 --> 10:12.680
 And that builds an organ that allows us

10:12.680 --> 10:14.920
 to do what we're doing today, right?

10:14.920 --> 10:16.360
 That is mind blowing.

10:16.360 --> 10:18.920
 And this is why developmental neurobiologists

10:18.920 --> 10:21.880
 never get tired of studying that.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.800
 Now you're asking about the code.

10:23.800 --> 10:24.880
 What drives this?

10:24.880 --> 10:26.480
 How is this done?

10:26.480 --> 10:29.720
 Well, it's millions of years of evolution

10:29.720 --> 10:33.160
 of really fine tuning gene expression programs

10:33.160 --> 10:37.440
 that allow certain cells to be made at a certain time

10:37.440 --> 10:41.680
 and to become a certain cell type,

10:41.680 --> 10:46.680
 but also mechanical forces of pressure bending.

10:47.360 --> 10:50.320
 This embryo is not just, it will not stay a tube,

10:50.320 --> 10:52.000
 this brain for very long.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.880
 At some point, this tube in the front of the embryo

10:54.880 --> 10:58.160
 will expand to make the primordium of the brain, right?

10:58.160 --> 11:02.840
 Now the forces that control that the cells feel,

11:02.840 --> 11:04.960
 and this is another beautiful thing,

11:04.960 --> 11:06.840
 the very force that they feel,

11:06.840 --> 11:10.240
 which is different from a week before, a week ago,

11:10.240 --> 11:12.280
 will tell the cell, oh, you're being squished

11:12.280 --> 11:16.600
 in a certain way, begin to produce these new genes

11:16.600 --> 11:18.440
 because now you are at the corner

11:18.440 --> 11:21.480
 or you are in a stretch of cells

11:21.480 --> 11:23.960
 or whatever it is, and that,

11:23.960 --> 11:26.000
 so that mechanical physical force

11:26.000 --> 11:29.480
 shapes the fate of the cell as well.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.920
 So it's not only chemical, it's also mechanical.

11:32.920 --> 11:34.440
 So from my perspective,

11:34.440 --> 11:39.440
 biology is this incredibly complex mess, gooey mess.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.880
 So you're saying mechanical forces.

11:43.880 --> 11:47.760
 How different is like a computer

11:47.760 --> 11:52.120
 or any kind of mechanical machine that we humans build

11:52.120 --> 11:54.000
 and the biological systems?

11:54.000 --> 11:54.840
 Have you been,

11:54.840 --> 11:57.000
 because you've worked a lot with biological systems.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.680
 Are they as much of a mess as it seems

12:00.680 --> 12:03.560
 from a perspective of an engineer, a mechanical engineer?

12:03.560 --> 12:08.400
 Yeah, they are much more prone

12:08.400 --> 12:11.680
 to taking alternative routes, right?

12:11.680 --> 12:16.040
 So if you, we go back to printing a brain

12:16.040 --> 12:18.200
 versus developing a brain,

12:18.200 --> 12:20.480
 of course, if you print a brain,

12:20.480 --> 12:23.040
 given that you start with the same building blocks,

12:23.040 --> 12:23.960
 the same cells,

12:23.960 --> 12:28.640
 you could potentially print it the same way every time,

12:28.640 --> 12:32.520
 but that final brain may not work the same way

12:32.520 --> 12:34.440
 as a brain built during development does

12:34.440 --> 12:38.720
 because the very same building blocks that you're using

12:38.720 --> 12:41.440
 developed in a completely different environment, right?

12:41.440 --> 12:43.040
 It was not the environment of the brain.

12:43.040 --> 12:46.680
 Therefore, they're gonna be different just by definition.

12:46.680 --> 12:50.480
 So if you instead use development to build,

12:50.480 --> 12:52.720
 let's say a brain organoid,

12:52.720 --> 12:55.840
 which maybe we will be talking about in a few minutes.

12:55.840 --> 12:56.960
 Those things are fascinating.

12:56.960 --> 13:01.960
 Yes, so if you use processes of development,

13:01.960 --> 13:03.360
 then when you watch it,

13:03.360 --> 13:06.440
 you can see that sometimes things can go wrong

13:06.440 --> 13:08.120
 in some organoids and by wrong,

13:08.120 --> 13:10.840
 I mean different one organoid from the next.

13:10.840 --> 13:14.800
 While if you think about that embryo, it always goes right.

13:14.800 --> 13:18.920
 So this development, it's for as complex as it is.

13:18.920 --> 13:23.600
 Every time a baby is born has, with very few exceptions,

13:23.600 --> 13:26.160
 so the brain is like the next baby,

13:26.160 --> 13:31.160
 but it's not the same if you develop it in a dish.

13:31.320 --> 13:33.800
 And first of all, we don't even develop a brain,

13:33.800 --> 13:36.040
 you develop something much simpler in the dish,

13:36.040 --> 13:39.640
 but there are more options for building things differently,

13:39.640 --> 13:42.920
 which really tells you that evolution

13:42.920 --> 13:47.920
 has played a really tight game here

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
 for how in the end the brain is built in vivo.

13:53.280 --> 13:55.360
 So just a quick, maybe dumb question,

13:55.360 --> 13:58.320
 but it seems like this is not,

13:58.320 --> 14:01.080
 the building process is not a dictatorship.

14:01.080 --> 14:03.320
 It seems like there's not a centralized,

14:04.760 --> 14:07.400
 like high level mechanism that says,

14:07.400 --> 14:10.240
 okay, this cell built itself the wrong way,

14:10.240 --> 14:11.480
 I'm gonna kill it.

14:11.480 --> 14:15.440
 It seems like there's a really strong distributed mechanism.

14:15.440 --> 14:18.400
 Is that in your sense for what you mean?

14:18.400 --> 14:20.880
 There are a lot of possibilities, right?

14:20.880 --> 14:23.560
 And if you think about, for example,

14:23.560 --> 14:26.720
 different species building their brain,

14:26.720 --> 14:28.840
 each brain is a little bit different.

14:28.840 --> 14:31.000
 So the brain of a lizard is very different

14:31.000 --> 14:35.480
 from that of a chicken, from that of one of us

14:35.480 --> 14:38.000
 and so on and so forth and still is a brain,

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
 but it was built differently starting from stem cells

14:43.240 --> 14:45.960
 that pretty much had the same potential,

14:45.960 --> 14:49.320
 but in the end, evolution builds different brains

14:49.320 --> 14:52.480
 in different species because that serves in a way

14:52.480 --> 14:53.960
 the purpose of that species

14:53.960 --> 14:56.560
 and the wellbeing of that organism.

14:56.560 --> 15:00.640
 And so there are many possibilities,

15:00.640 --> 15:04.760
 but then there is a way and you were talking about a code.

15:04.760 --> 15:07.440
 Nobody knows what the entire code of development is.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.600
 Of course we don't.

15:08.600 --> 15:13.320
 We know bits and pieces of very specific aspects

15:13.320 --> 15:14.440
 of development of the brain,

15:14.440 --> 15:17.000
 what genes are involved to make a certain cell types,

15:17.000 --> 15:20.320
 how those two cells interact to make the next level structure

15:20.320 --> 15:22.760
 that we might know, but the entirety of it,

15:22.760 --> 15:26.120
 how it's so well controlled, it's really mind blowing.

15:26.120 --> 15:29.760
 So in the first two months in the embryo or whatever,

15:29.760 --> 15:32.680
 the first few weeks, months,

15:32.680 --> 15:37.080
 so yeah, the building blocks are constructed.

15:37.080 --> 15:40.000
 The actual, the different regions of the brain,

15:40.000 --> 15:42.720
 I guess in the nervous system.

15:42.720 --> 15:44.280
 Well, this continues way longer

15:44.280 --> 15:46.440
 than just the first few months.

15:46.440 --> 15:50.400
 So over the very first few months,

15:50.400 --> 15:52.000
 you build a lot of the cells,

15:52.000 --> 15:56.720
 but then there is continuous building of new cell types

15:56.720 --> 15:58.360
 all the way through birth.

15:58.360 --> 16:00.360
 And then even postnatally,

16:00.360 --> 16:03.960
 I don't know if you've ever heard of myelin.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.680
 Myelin is this sort of insulation

16:06.680 --> 16:09.800
 that is built around the cables of the neurons

16:09.800 --> 16:12.160
 so that the electricity can go really fast from.

16:12.160 --> 16:13.400
 The axons, I guess they're called.

16:13.400 --> 16:15.960
 The axons, they're called axons, exactly.

16:15.960 --> 16:19.680
 And so as human beings,

16:19.680 --> 16:24.320
 we myelinate our cells postnatally.

16:24.320 --> 16:28.720
 A kid, a six year old kid has barely started

16:28.720 --> 16:31.880
 the process of making the mature oligodendrocytes,

16:31.880 --> 16:33.640
 which are the cells that then eventually

16:33.640 --> 16:36.600
 will wrap the axons into myelin.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.960
 And this will continue, believe it or not,

16:38.960 --> 16:42.440
 until we are about 25, 30 years old.

16:42.440 --> 16:45.320
 So there is a continuous process of maturation

16:45.320 --> 16:47.080
 and tweaking and additions,

16:47.080 --> 16:51.040
 and also in response to what we do.

16:51.040 --> 16:53.960
 I remember taking AP Biology in high school,

16:53.960 --> 16:57.040
 and in the textbook, it said that,

16:57.040 --> 16:58.560
 I'm going by memory here,

16:58.560 --> 17:01.080
 that scientists disagree on the purpose

17:01.080 --> 17:04.720
 of myelin in the brain.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.320
 Is that totally wrong?

17:06.320 --> 17:10.600
 So like, I guess it speeds up the,

17:12.240 --> 17:13.200
 okay, I might be wrong here,

17:13.200 --> 17:14.760
 but I guess it speeds up the electricity

17:14.760 --> 17:17.160
 traveling down the axon or something.

17:17.160 --> 17:20.160
 Yeah, so that's the most sort of canonical,

17:20.160 --> 17:21.720
 and definitely that's the case.

17:21.720 --> 17:24.880
 So you have to imagine an axon,

17:24.880 --> 17:27.680
 and you can think about it as a cable of some type

17:27.680 --> 17:29.520
 with electricity going through.

17:29.520 --> 17:34.400
 And what myelin does, by insulating the outside,

17:34.400 --> 17:36.360
 I should say there are tracts of myelin

17:36.360 --> 17:39.640
 and pieces of axons that are naked without myelin.

17:39.640 --> 17:41.760
 And so by having the insulation,

17:41.760 --> 17:43.320
 the electricity, instead of going straight

17:43.320 --> 17:45.160
 through the cable, it will jump

17:45.160 --> 17:47.240
 over a piece of myelin, right,

17:47.240 --> 17:49.960
 to the next naked little piece and jump again.

17:49.960 --> 17:52.720
 And therefore, that's the idea that you go faster.

17:52.720 --> 17:57.400
 And it was always thought that in order to build

17:57.400 --> 18:00.640
 a big brain, a big nervous system,

18:00.640 --> 18:03.000
 in order to have a nervous system

18:03.000 --> 18:05.320
 that can do very complex type of things,

18:05.320 --> 18:06.640
 then you need a lot of myelin

18:06.640 --> 18:09.680
 because you wanna go fast with this information

18:09.680 --> 18:12.400
 from point A to point B.

18:12.400 --> 18:16.840
 Well, a few years ago, maybe five years ago or so,

18:16.840 --> 18:19.520
 we discovered that some of the most evolved,

18:19.520 --> 18:23.120
 which means the newest type of neurons that we have

18:23.120 --> 18:25.480
 as nonhuman primates, as human beings

18:25.480 --> 18:28.040
 in the top of our cerebral cortex,

18:28.040 --> 18:29.840
 which should be the neurons that do some

18:29.840 --> 18:32.160
 of the most complex things that we do,

18:32.160 --> 18:36.120
 well, those have axons that have very little myelin.

18:36.120 --> 18:36.960
 Wow.

18:36.960 --> 18:41.000
 And they have very interesting ways

18:41.000 --> 18:43.360
 in which they put this myelin on their axons.

18:43.360 --> 18:44.520
 You know, a little piece here,

18:44.520 --> 18:47.640
 then a long track with no myelin, another chunk there.

18:47.640 --> 18:49.840
 And some don't have myelin at all.

18:49.840 --> 18:52.400
 So now, you have to explain

18:52.400 --> 18:57.240
 where we're going with evolution.

18:57.240 --> 18:58.760
 And if you think about it,

18:58.760 --> 19:00.560
 perhaps as an electrical engineer,

19:01.880 --> 19:05.240
 when I looked at it, I initially thought,

19:05.240 --> 19:06.880
 and I'm a developmental neurobiologist,

19:06.880 --> 19:10.160
 I thought maybe this is what we see now,

19:10.160 --> 19:13.480
 but if we give evolution another few million years,

19:13.480 --> 19:15.840
 we'll see a lot of myelin on these neurons too.

19:15.840 --> 19:19.640
 But I actually think now that that's instead the future

19:19.640 --> 19:20.480
 of the brain.

19:20.480 --> 19:21.320
 Less myelin.

19:21.320 --> 19:24.200
 Less myelin might allow for more flexibility

19:24.200 --> 19:26.200
 on what you do with your axons,

19:26.200 --> 19:28.000
 and therefore more complicated

19:28.000 --> 19:31.640
 and unpredictable type of functions,

19:31.640 --> 19:33.800
 which is also a bit mind blowing.

19:33.800 --> 19:37.960
 So it seems like it's controlling the timing of the signal.

19:37.960 --> 19:42.800
 So they're in the timing, you can encode a lot of information.

19:42.800 --> 19:43.640
 Yeah.

19:43.640 --> 19:44.480
 And so the brain.

19:44.480 --> 19:48.520
 The timing, the chemistry of that little piece of axon,

19:48.520 --> 19:52.080
 perhaps it's a dynamic process where the myelin can move.

19:52.080 --> 19:57.080
 Now you see how many layers of variability you can add,

19:57.440 --> 19:58.880
 and that's actually really good

19:58.880 --> 20:02.240
 if you're trying to come up with a new function

20:02.240 --> 20:06.520
 or a new capability or something unpredictable in a way.

20:06.520 --> 20:08.160
 So we're gonna jump around a little bit,

20:08.160 --> 20:12.800
 but the old question of how much is nature

20:12.800 --> 20:14.480
 and how much is nurture?

20:14.480 --> 20:17.240
 In terms of this incredible thing

20:17.240 --> 20:18.920
 after the development is over,

20:20.160 --> 20:25.160
 we seem to be kind of somewhat smart, intelligent,

20:26.080 --> 20:27.520
 cognition, consciousness,

20:27.520 --> 20:29.720
 all of these things are just incredible,

20:29.720 --> 20:31.960
 ability to reason and so on emerge.

20:31.960 --> 20:34.880
 In your sense, how much is in the hardware,

20:34.880 --> 20:39.000
 in the nature and how much is in the nurture

20:39.000 --> 20:40.960
 is learned through with our parents

20:40.960 --> 20:42.440
 through interacting with the environment and so on.

20:42.440 --> 20:43.760
 It's really both, right?

20:43.760 --> 20:45.000
 If you think about it.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
 So we are born with a brain as babies

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
 that has most of its cells and most of its structures.

20:53.600 --> 20:57.880
 And that will take a few years to grow,

20:57.880 --> 21:00.600
 to add more, to be better.

21:00.600 --> 21:04.120
 But really then we have this 20 years

21:04.120 --> 21:07.000
 of interacting with the environment around us.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.760
 And so what that brain that was so perfectly built

21:10.760 --> 21:15.760
 or imperfectly built due to our genetic cues

21:16.400 --> 21:20.160
 will then be used to incorporate the environment

21:20.160 --> 21:22.720
 in its further maturation and development.

21:22.720 --> 21:26.960
 And so your experiences do shape your brain.

21:26.960 --> 21:29.440
 I mean, we know that like if you and I

21:29.440 --> 21:32.960
 may have had a different childhood or a different,

21:32.960 --> 21:35.040
 we have been going to different schools,

21:35.040 --> 21:36.440
 we have been learning different things

21:36.440 --> 21:38.760
 and our brain is a little bit different because of that.

21:38.760 --> 21:41.120
 We behave differently because of that.

21:41.120 --> 21:44.000
 And so especially postnatally

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
 experience is extremely important.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.760
 We are born with a plastic brain.

21:48.760 --> 21:51.440
 What that means is a brain that is able to change

21:51.440 --> 21:56.320
 in response to stimuli that can be sensory.

21:56.320 --> 22:01.000
 So perhaps some of the most illuminating studies

22:01.000 --> 22:03.400
 that were done were studies in which

22:03.400 --> 22:06.720
 the sensory organs were not working, right?

22:06.720 --> 22:09.520
 Like if you are born with eyes that don't work,

22:09.520 --> 22:12.520
 then your very brain, that piece of the brain

22:12.520 --> 22:16.040
 that normally would process vision, the visual cortex,

22:17.200 --> 22:19.800
 develops postnatally differently

22:19.800 --> 22:23.480
 and it might be used to do something different, right?

22:23.480 --> 22:25.600
 So that's the most extreme.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.440
 The plasticity of the brain, I guess,

22:27.440 --> 22:29.400
 is the magic hardware that it,

22:29.400 --> 22:32.920
 and then it's flexibility in all forms

22:32.920 --> 22:36.280
 is what enables the learning postnatally.

22:36.280 --> 22:39.200
 Can you talk about organoids?

22:39.200 --> 22:40.840
 What are they?

22:40.840 --> 22:44.320
 And how can you use them to help us understand the brain

22:44.320 --> 22:45.680
 and the development of the brain?

22:45.680 --> 22:47.280
 This is very, very important.

22:47.280 --> 22:49.880
 So the first thing I'd like to say,

22:49.880 --> 22:51.360
 please skip this in the video.

22:52.680 --> 22:56.040
 The first thing I'd like to say is that an organoid,

22:56.040 --> 22:59.480
 a brain organoid is not the same as a brain.

23:00.680 --> 23:01.600
 Okay?

23:01.600 --> 23:03.600
 It's a fundamental distinction.

23:03.600 --> 23:08.520
 It's a system, a cellular system

23:08.520 --> 23:12.160
 that one can develop in the culture dish,

23:12.160 --> 23:17.160
 starting from stem cells that will mimic some aspects

23:17.160 --> 23:21.360
 of the development of the brain, but not all of it.

23:21.360 --> 23:23.720
 They are very small, maximum,

23:23.720 --> 23:27.880
 they become about four to five millimeters in diameters.

23:27.880 --> 23:32.880
 They are much simpler than our brain, of course,

23:32.880 --> 23:35.960
 but yet they are the only system

23:35.960 --> 23:39.040
 where we can literally watch a process

23:39.040 --> 23:42.040
 of human brain development unfold.

23:42.040 --> 23:44.600
 And by watch, I mean, study it.

23:44.600 --> 23:47.520
 Remember when I told you that we can't understand

23:47.520 --> 23:49.520
 everything about development in our own brain

23:49.520 --> 23:51.000
 by studying a mouse?

23:51.000 --> 23:53.080
 Well, we can't study the actual process

23:53.080 --> 23:54.280
 of development of the human brain

23:54.280 --> 23:55.760
 because it all happens in utero.

23:55.760 --> 23:58.800
 So we will never have access to that process ever.

23:58.800 --> 24:02.960
 And therefore, this is our next best thing.

24:02.960 --> 24:06.960
 Like a bunch of stem cells that can be coaxed

24:06.960 --> 24:10.240
 into starting a process of neural tube formation.

24:10.240 --> 24:13.200
 Remember that tube that is made by the embryo early on.

24:13.200 --> 24:15.640
 And from there, a lot of the cell types

24:15.640 --> 24:19.200
 that are present within the brain,

24:19.200 --> 24:23.480
 and you can simply watch it and study,

24:23.480 --> 24:27.200
 but you can also think about diseases

24:27.200 --> 24:29.800
 where development of the brain

24:29.800 --> 24:33.240
 does not proceed normally, right, properly.

24:33.240 --> 24:34.880
 Think about neurodevelopmental diseases.

24:34.880 --> 24:37.320
 There are many, many different types.

24:37.320 --> 24:39.160
 Think about autism spectrum disorders.

24:39.160 --> 24:41.680
 There are also many different types of autism.

24:41.680 --> 24:44.360
 So there you could take a stem cell,

24:44.360 --> 24:46.600
 which really means either a sample of blood

24:46.600 --> 24:50.080
 or a sample of skin from the patient,

24:50.080 --> 24:53.520
 make a stem cell, and then with that stem cell,

24:53.520 --> 24:56.200
 watch a process of formation of a brain organ

24:56.200 --> 25:00.600
 or a brain organoid of that person with that genetics,

25:00.600 --> 25:02.200
 with that genetic code in it.

25:02.200 --> 25:05.800
 And you can ask, what is this genetic code doing

25:05.800 --> 25:08.760
 to some aspects of development of the brain?

25:08.760 --> 25:12.000
 And for the first time, you may come to solutions

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
 like what cells are involved in autism, right?

25:16.000 --> 25:17.360
 So many questions around this.

25:17.360 --> 25:20.520
 So if you take this human stem cell

25:20.520 --> 25:23.360
 for that particular person with that genetic code,

25:23.360 --> 25:26.520
 how, and you try to build an organoid,

25:26.520 --> 25:28.840
 how often will it look similar?

25:28.840 --> 25:31.800
 What's the, yeah, so.

25:31.800 --> 25:33.240
 The reproducibility?

25:33.240 --> 25:36.600
 Yes, or how much variability is the flip side of that?

25:36.600 --> 25:40.280
 Yeah, so there is much more variability

25:40.280 --> 25:44.520
 in building organoids than there is in building brain.

25:44.520 --> 25:47.280
 It's really true that the majority of us,

25:47.280 --> 25:49.560
 when we are born as babies,

25:49.560 --> 25:52.440
 our brains look a lot like each other.

25:52.440 --> 25:54.880
 This is the magic that the embryo does,

25:54.880 --> 25:57.640
 where it builds a brain in the context of a body

25:57.640 --> 26:01.240
 and there is very little variability there.

26:01.240 --> 26:02.280
 There is disease, of course,

26:02.280 --> 26:03.960
 but in general, a little variability.

26:03.960 --> 26:05.760
 When you build an organoid,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.480
 we don't have the full code for how this is done.

26:09.480 --> 26:13.400
 And so in part, the organoid somewhat builds itself

26:13.400 --> 26:15.560
 because there are some structures of the brain

26:15.560 --> 26:17.240
 that the cells know how to make.

26:18.120 --> 26:21.800
 And another part comes from the investigator,

26:21.800 --> 26:26.120
 the scientist adding to the media factors

26:26.120 --> 26:27.960
 that we know in the mouse, for example,

26:27.960 --> 26:30.680
 would foster a certain step of development,

26:30.680 --> 26:33.160
 but it's very limited.

26:33.160 --> 26:36.080
 And so as a result,

26:36.080 --> 26:38.120
 the kind of product you get in the end

26:38.120 --> 26:39.640
 is much more reductionist,

26:39.640 --> 26:42.600
 is much more simple than what you get in vivo.

26:42.600 --> 26:46.120
 It mimics early events of development as of today,

26:46.120 --> 26:49.040
 and it doesn't build very complex type of anatomy

26:49.040 --> 26:52.480
 and structure does not as of today,

26:52.480 --> 26:54.840
 which happens instead in vivo.

26:54.840 --> 26:59.040
 And also the variability that you see,

26:59.040 --> 27:02.720
 one organ to the next tends to be higher

27:02.720 --> 27:05.480
 than when you compare an embryo to the next.

27:05.480 --> 27:07.320
 So, okay, then the next question is,

27:07.320 --> 27:11.040
 how hard and maybe another flip side of that expensive

27:11.040 --> 27:14.880
 is it to go from one stem cell to an organoid?

27:14.880 --> 27:16.680
 How many can you build in like,

27:16.680 --> 27:18.400
 because it sounds very complicated.

27:18.400 --> 27:23.400
 It's work definitely, and it's money definitely,

27:23.400 --> 27:28.000
 but you can really grow a very high number

27:28.000 --> 27:31.560
 of these organoids, can go perhaps,

27:31.560 --> 27:32.680
 I told you the maximum,

27:32.680 --> 27:35.320
 they become about five millimeters in diameter.

27:35.320 --> 27:39.920
 So this is about the size of a tiny, tiny raisin,

27:40.920 --> 27:43.120
 or perhaps the seed of an apple.

27:43.120 --> 27:47.480
 And so you can grow 50 to 100 of those

27:47.480 --> 27:51.240
 inside one big bioreactors, which are these flasks

27:51.240 --> 27:55.440
 where the media provides nutrients for the organoids.

27:55.440 --> 28:00.440
 So the problem is not to grow more or less of them.

28:01.680 --> 28:06.440
 It's really to figure out how to grow them in a way

28:06.440 --> 28:08.360
 that they are more and more reproducible,

28:08.360 --> 28:09.920
 for example, organoid to organoid,

28:09.920 --> 28:13.160
 so they can be used to study a biological process.

28:13.160 --> 28:15.560
 Because if you have too much variability,

28:15.560 --> 28:17.080
 then you never know if what you see

28:17.080 --> 28:19.520
 is just an exception or really the rule.

28:19.520 --> 28:22.200
 So what does an organoid look like?

28:22.200 --> 28:25.080
 Are there different neurons already emerging?

28:25.080 --> 28:28.520
 Is there, well, first, can you tell me

28:28.520 --> 28:29.920
 what kind of neurons are there?

28:29.920 --> 28:30.880
 Yes.

28:30.880 --> 28:35.560
 Are they sort of all the same?

28:35.560 --> 28:37.160
 Are they not all the same?

28:38.200 --> 28:39.520
 How much do we understand?

28:39.520 --> 28:43.440
 And how much of that variance, if any,

28:43.440 --> 28:45.800
 can exist in organoids?

28:45.800 --> 28:47.000
 Yes.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.400
 So you could grow,

28:49.400 --> 28:52.440
 I told you that the brain has different parts.

28:52.440 --> 28:55.960
 So the cerebral cortex is on the top part of the brain,

28:55.960 --> 28:57.960
 but there is another region called the striatum

28:57.960 --> 28:59.960
 that is below the cortex and so on and so forth.

28:59.960 --> 29:03.760
 All of these regions have different types of cells

29:03.760 --> 29:05.640
 in the actual brain, okay?

29:05.640 --> 29:08.880
 And so scientists have been able to grow organoids

29:08.880 --> 29:11.440
 that may mimic some aspects of development

29:11.440 --> 29:13.960
 of these different regions of the brain.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.440
 And so we are very interested in the cerebral cortex.

29:16.440 --> 29:17.760
 That's the coolest part, right?

29:17.760 --> 29:18.600
 Very cool.

29:18.600 --> 29:20.880
 I agree with you.

29:20.880 --> 29:22.040
 We wouldn't be here talking

29:22.040 --> 29:23.880
 if we didn't have a cerebral cortex.

29:23.880 --> 29:26.040
 It's also, I like to think, the part of the brain

29:26.040 --> 29:27.600
 that really truly makes us human,

29:27.600 --> 29:30.200
 the most evolved in recent evolution.

29:30.200 --> 29:33.600
 And so in the attempt to make the cerebral cortex

29:33.600 --> 29:37.200
 and by figuring out a way to have these organoids

29:37.200 --> 29:40.240
 continue to grow and develop for extended periods of times,

29:40.240 --> 29:42.440
 much like it happens in the real embryo,

29:42.440 --> 29:44.240
 months and months in culture,

29:44.240 --> 29:48.560
 then you can see that many different types of neurons

29:48.560 --> 29:50.120
 of the cortex appear.

29:50.120 --> 29:52.120
 And at some point, also the astrocytes,

29:52.120 --> 29:57.120
 so the glia cells of the cerebral cortex also appear.

29:57.600 --> 30:00.320
 What are these astrocytes?

30:00.320 --> 30:03.360
 The astrocytes are not neurons, so they're not nerve cells,

30:03.360 --> 30:06.120
 but they play very important roles.

30:06.120 --> 30:08.960
 One important role is to support the neuron.

30:08.960 --> 30:11.800
 But of course, they have much more active type of roles.

30:11.800 --> 30:14.480
 They're very important, for example, to make the synapses,

30:14.480 --> 30:17.560
 which are the point of contact and communication

30:17.560 --> 30:18.800
 between two neurons.

30:21.400 --> 30:25.600
 So all that chemistry fun happens in the synapses,

30:25.600 --> 30:28.120
 happens because of these cells?

30:28.120 --> 30:29.560
 Are they the medium in which?

30:29.560 --> 30:31.960
 It happens because of the interactions,

30:31.960 --> 30:34.720
 happens because you are making the cells

30:34.720 --> 30:36.280
 and they have certain properties,

30:36.280 --> 30:40.320
 including the ability to make neurotransmitters,

30:40.320 --> 30:43.240
 which are the chemicals that are secreted to the synapses,

30:43.240 --> 30:46.440
 including the ability of making these axons grow

30:46.440 --> 30:49.120
 with their growth cones and so on and so forth.

30:49.120 --> 30:51.320
 And then you have other cells around it

30:51.320 --> 30:55.160
 that release chemicals or touch the neurons

30:55.160 --> 30:57.120
 or interact with them in different ways

30:57.120 --> 30:59.800
 to really foster this perfect process,

30:59.800 --> 31:02.440
 in this case of synaptogenesis.

31:02.440 --> 31:05.640
 And this does happen within organoids.

31:05.640 --> 31:09.720
 So the mechanical and the chemical stuff happens.

31:09.720 --> 31:11.600
 The connectivity between neurons,

31:11.600 --> 31:13.320
 this in a way is not surprising

31:13.320 --> 31:18.120
 because scientists have been culturing neurons forever.

31:18.120 --> 31:20.760
 And when you take a neuron, even a very young one,

31:20.760 --> 31:23.480
 and you culture it, eventually finds another cell

31:23.480 --> 31:26.920
 or another neuron to talk to, it will form a synapse.

31:26.920 --> 31:28.520
 Are we talking about mice neurons?

31:28.520 --> 31:29.640
 Are we talking about human neurons?

31:29.640 --> 31:30.600
 It doesn't matter, both.

31:30.600 --> 31:33.240
 So you can culture a neuron, like a single neuron

31:33.240 --> 31:37.920
 and give it a little friend and it starts interacting?

31:37.920 --> 31:41.000
 Yes, so neurons are able to, it sounds,

31:41.000 --> 31:43.520
 it's more simple than what it may sound to you.

31:44.600 --> 31:48.320
 Neurons have molecular properties and structural properties

31:48.320 --> 31:50.920
 that allow them to really communicate with other cells.

31:50.920 --> 31:53.200
 And so if you put not one neuron,

31:53.200 --> 31:55.160
 but if you put several neurons together,

31:55.160 --> 31:59.400
 chances are that they will form synapses with each other.

32:00.280 --> 32:01.120
 Okay, great.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.360
 So an organoid is not a brain.

32:03.360 --> 32:04.200
 No.

32:04.200 --> 32:09.200
 But there's some, it's able to,

32:09.240 --> 32:10.440
 especially what you're talking about,

32:10.440 --> 32:15.120
 mimics some properties of the cerebral cortex, for example.

32:15.120 --> 32:17.960
 So what can you understand about the brain

32:17.960 --> 32:21.080
 by studying an organoid of a cerebral cortex?

32:21.080 --> 32:25.800
 I can literally study all this incredible diversity

32:25.800 --> 32:28.040
 of cell type, all these many, many different classes

32:28.040 --> 32:30.760
 of cells, how are they made?

32:30.760 --> 32:32.520
 How do they look like?

32:32.520 --> 32:34.960
 What do they need to be made properly?

32:34.960 --> 32:39.720
 And what goes wrong if now the genetics of that stem cell

32:39.720 --> 32:42.800
 that I used to make the organoid came from a patient

32:42.800 --> 32:44.320
 with a neurodevelopmental disease?

32:44.320 --> 32:47.640
 Can I actually watch for the very first time

32:47.640 --> 32:51.400
 what may have gone wrong years before in this kid

32:51.400 --> 32:53.520
 when its own brain was being made?

32:53.520 --> 32:54.760
 Think about that loop.

32:54.760 --> 32:59.600
 In a way, it's a little tiny rudimentary window

32:59.600 --> 33:04.280
 into the past, into the time when that brain

33:04.280 --> 33:07.680
 in a kid that had this neurodevelopmental disease

33:07.680 --> 33:08.880
 was being made.

33:10.120 --> 33:12.880
 And I think that's unbelievably powerful

33:12.880 --> 33:16.800
 because today we have no idea of what cell types,

33:16.800 --> 33:18.760
 we barely know what brain regions

33:18.760 --> 33:20.880
 are affected in these diseases.

33:20.880 --> 33:23.720
 Now we have an experimental system

33:23.720 --> 33:25.440
 that we can study in the lab.

33:25.440 --> 33:28.440
 And we can ask, what are the cells affected?

33:28.440 --> 33:31.840
 When during development things went wrong?

33:31.840 --> 33:34.080
 What are the molecules among the many, many

33:34.080 --> 33:36.600
 different molecules that control brain development?

33:36.600 --> 33:39.720
 Which ones are the ones that really messed up here

33:39.720 --> 33:42.160
 and we want perhaps to fix?

33:42.160 --> 33:44.520
 And what is really the final product?

33:44.520 --> 33:48.560
 Is it a less strong kind of circuit and brain?

33:48.560 --> 33:51.000
 Is it a brain that lacks a cell type?

33:51.000 --> 33:52.040
 What is it?

33:52.040 --> 33:54.920
 Because then we can think about treatment

33:54.920 --> 33:59.360
 and care for these patients that is informed

33:59.360 --> 34:02.080
 rather than just based on current diagnostics.

34:02.080 --> 34:04.560
 So how hard is it to detect

34:04.560 --> 34:06.360
 through the developmental process?

34:06.360 --> 34:09.440
 It's a super exciting tool

34:10.520 --> 34:14.000
 to see how different conditions develop.

34:15.200 --> 34:17.640
 How hard is it to detect that, wait a minute,

34:17.640 --> 34:20.800
 this is abnormal development.

34:20.800 --> 34:21.640
 Yeah.

34:21.640 --> 34:24.760
 How much signal is there?

34:24.760 --> 34:26.480
 How much of it is it a mess?

34:26.480 --> 34:29.440
 Because things can go wrong at multiple levels, right?

34:29.440 --> 34:34.280
 You could have a cell that is born and built

34:34.280 --> 34:36.200
 but then doesn't work properly

34:36.200 --> 34:38.280
 or a cell that is not even born

34:38.280 --> 34:40.680
 or a cell that doesn't interact with other cells differently

34:40.680 --> 34:42.080
 and so on and so forth.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.360
 So today we have technology

34:44.360 --> 34:47.720
 that we did not have even five years ago

34:47.720 --> 34:49.760
 that allows us to look for example

34:49.760 --> 34:52.080
 at the molecular picture of a cell,

34:52.080 --> 34:56.560
 of a single cell in a sea of cells with high precision.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.800
 And so that molecular information

34:58.800 --> 35:01.720
 where you compare many, many single cells

35:01.720 --> 35:03.600
 for the genes that they produce

35:03.600 --> 35:06.120
 between a control individual

35:06.120 --> 35:10.080
 and an individual with a neurodevelopmental disease,

35:10.080 --> 35:13.760
 that may tell you what is different molecularly.

35:13.760 --> 35:18.520
 Or you could see that some cells are not even made,

35:18.520 --> 35:20.720
 for example, or that the process of maturation

35:20.720 --> 35:22.560
 of the cells may be wrong.

35:22.560 --> 35:24.960
 There are many different levels here

35:25.920 --> 35:29.520
 and we can study the cells at the molecular level

35:29.520 --> 35:33.320
 but also we can use the organoids to ask questions

35:33.320 --> 35:35.240
 about the properties of the neurons,

35:35.240 --> 35:37.280
 the functional properties,

35:37.280 --> 35:38.880
 how they communicate with each other,

35:38.880 --> 35:41.320
 how they respond to a stimulus and so on and so forth.

35:41.320 --> 35:46.320
 And we may get an abnormalities there, right?

35:46.320 --> 35:47.440
 Detect those.

35:47.440 --> 35:50.560
 So how early is this work in the,

35:51.760 --> 35:54.240
 maybe in the history of science?

35:54.240 --> 35:59.240
 So, I mean like, so if you were to,

35:59.720 --> 36:04.720
 if you and I time travel a thousand years into the future,

36:05.160 --> 36:09.880
 organoids seem to be, maybe I'm romanticizing the notion

36:09.880 --> 36:12.720
 but you're building not a brain

36:12.720 --> 36:15.640
 but something that has properties of a brain.

36:15.640 --> 36:18.960
 So it feels like you might be getting close to,

36:18.960 --> 36:23.160
 in the building process, to build this to understand.

36:23.160 --> 36:28.160
 So how far are we in this understanding

36:29.000 --> 36:30.200
 process of development?

36:31.320 --> 36:34.160
 A thousand years from now, it's a long time from now.

36:34.160 --> 36:36.360
 So if this planet is still gonna be here

36:36.360 --> 36:38.160
 a thousand years from now.

36:38.160 --> 36:41.960
 So, I mean, if, you know, like they write a book,

36:41.960 --> 36:43.960
 obviously there'll be a chapter about you.

36:43.960 --> 36:47.320
 That's right, that science fiction book, today.

36:47.320 --> 36:49.920
 Yeah, today, about, I mean, I guess where

36:49.920 --> 36:52.040
 we really understood very little about the brain

36:52.040 --> 36:55.880
 a century ago, I was a big fan in high school

36:55.880 --> 36:58.760
 of reading Freud and so on, still am of psychiatry.

36:59.680 --> 37:01.480
 I would say we still understand very little

37:01.480 --> 37:03.680
 about the functional aspect of just,

37:04.680 --> 37:07.760
 but how in the history of understanding

37:07.760 --> 37:09.640
 the biology of the brain, the development,

37:09.640 --> 37:11.240
 how far are we along?

37:11.240 --> 37:12.960
 It's a very good question.

37:12.960 --> 37:15.520
 And so this is just, of course, my opinion.

37:15.520 --> 37:19.720
 I think that we did not have technology

37:19.720 --> 37:23.160
 even 10 years ago or certainly not 20 years ago

37:23.160 --> 37:27.760
 to even think about experimentally investigating

37:27.760 --> 37:30.160
 the development of the human brain.

37:30.160 --> 37:32.200
 So we've done a lot of work in science

37:32.200 --> 37:35.480
 to study the brain or many other organisms.

37:35.480 --> 37:39.600
 Now we have some technologies which I'll spell out

37:39.600 --> 37:43.120
 that allow us to actually look at the real thing

37:43.120 --> 37:45.040
 and look at the brain, at the human brain.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.840
 So what are these technologies?

37:46.840 --> 37:50.440
 There has been huge progress in stem cell biology.

37:50.440 --> 37:54.080
 The moment someone figured out how to turn a skin cell

37:54.080 --> 37:57.760
 into an embryonic stem cell, basically,

37:57.760 --> 38:00.160
 and that how that embryonic stem cell

38:00.160 --> 38:02.480
 could begin a process of development again

38:02.480 --> 38:04.000
 to, for example, make a brain,

38:04.000 --> 38:06.040
 there was a huge advance,

38:06.040 --> 38:08.160
 and in fact, there was a Nobel Prize for that.

38:08.160 --> 38:10.400
 That started the field, really,

38:10.400 --> 38:14.200
 of using stem cells to build organs.

38:14.200 --> 38:17.000
 Now we can build on all the knowledge of development

38:17.000 --> 38:18.520
 that we build over the many, many, many years

38:18.520 --> 38:20.680
 to say, how do we make the stem cells

38:20.680 --> 38:22.640
 now make more and more complex aspects

38:22.640 --> 38:24.360
 of development of the human brain?

38:25.240 --> 38:28.440
 So this field is young, the field of brain organoids,

38:28.440 --> 38:30.080
 but it's moving faster.

38:30.080 --> 38:32.520
 And it's moving fast in a very serious way

38:32.520 --> 38:35.920
 that is rooted in labs with the right ethical framework

38:35.920 --> 38:40.680
 and really building on solid science

38:40.680 --> 38:43.040
 for what reality is and what is not.

38:44.680 --> 38:49.080
 But it will go faster and it will be more and more powerful.

38:49.080 --> 38:51.440
 We also have technology that allows us

38:51.440 --> 38:54.600
 to basically study the properties of single cells

38:54.600 --> 38:59.200
 across many, many millions of single cells,

38:59.200 --> 39:02.120
 which we didn't have perhaps five years ago.

39:02.120 --> 39:04.800
 So now with that, even an organoid

39:04.800 --> 39:08.440
 that has millions of cells can be profiled in a way,

39:08.440 --> 39:11.280
 looked at with very, very high resolution,

39:11.280 --> 39:13.920
 the single cell level to really understand

39:13.920 --> 39:14.880
 what is going on.

39:14.880 --> 39:17.480
 And you could do it in multiple stages of development

39:17.480 --> 39:20.080
 and you can build your hypothesis and so on and so forth.

39:20.080 --> 39:22.560
 So it's not gonna be a thousand years.

39:22.560 --> 39:25.200
 It's gonna be a shorter amount of time.

39:25.200 --> 39:29.440
 And I see this as sort of an exponential growth

39:29.440 --> 39:33.520
 of this field enabled by these technologies

39:33.520 --> 39:34.960
 that we didn't have before.

39:34.960 --> 39:36.920
 And so we're gonna see something transformative

39:36.920 --> 39:41.840
 that we didn't see at all in the prior thousand years.

39:41.840 --> 39:44.600
 So I apologize for the crazy sci fi questions,

39:44.600 --> 39:48.120
 but the developmental process is fascinating

39:48.120 --> 39:53.120
 to watch and study, but how far are we away from

39:53.320 --> 39:57.240
 and maybe how difficult is it to build

39:57.240 --> 40:02.240
 not just an organoid, but a human brain from a stem cell?

40:02.240 --> 40:05.640
 Yeah, first of all, that's not the goal

40:05.640 --> 40:07.680
 for the majority of the serious scientists

40:07.680 --> 40:12.640
 that work on this because you don't have to build

40:12.640 --> 40:16.040
 the whole human brain to make this model useful

40:16.040 --> 40:17.920
 for understanding how the brain develops

40:17.920 --> 40:20.400
 or understanding disease.

40:20.400 --> 40:22.400
 You don't have to build the whole thing.

40:22.400 --> 40:25.160
 So let me just comment on this, fascinating.

40:25.160 --> 40:29.160
 It shows to me the difference between you and I

40:29.160 --> 40:31.800
 as you're actually trying to understand

40:31.800 --> 40:34.200
 the beauty of the human brain and to use it

40:34.200 --> 40:36.880
 to really help thousands or millions of people

40:36.880 --> 40:38.800
 with disease and so on, right?

40:38.800 --> 40:41.480
 From an artificial intelligence perspective,

40:41.480 --> 40:45.600
 we're trying to build systems that we can put in robots

40:45.600 --> 40:49.080
 and try to create systems that have echoes

40:49.080 --> 40:52.360
 of the intelligence about reasoning about the world,

40:52.360 --> 40:53.600
 navigating the world.

40:53.600 --> 40:56.000
 It's different objectives, I think.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.560
 Yeah, that's very much science fiction.

40:57.560 --> 41:00.480
 Science fiction, but we operate in science fiction a little bit.

41:00.480 --> 41:03.400
 So on that point of building a brain,

41:03.400 --> 41:06.160
 even though that is not the focus or interest, perhaps,

41:06.160 --> 41:08.480
 of the community, how difficult is it?

41:08.480 --> 41:11.160
 Is it truly science fiction at this point?

41:11.160 --> 41:13.920
 I think the field will progress, like I said,

41:13.920 --> 41:17.240
 and that the system will be more and more complex

41:17.240 --> 41:18.680
 in a way, right?

41:18.680 --> 41:23.680
 But there are properties that emerge from the human brain

41:23.840 --> 41:25.360
 that have to do with the mind,

41:25.360 --> 41:26.720
 that may have to do with consciousness,

41:26.720 --> 41:29.800
 that may have to do with intelligence or whatever

41:29.800 --> 41:31.960
 that we really don't understand

41:31.960 --> 41:35.560
 even how they can emerge from an actual, real brain.

41:35.560 --> 41:39.120
 And therefore, we can now measure or study in an organoid.

41:39.120 --> 41:43.000
 So I think that this field, many, many years from now,

41:43.000 --> 41:46.960
 may lead to the building of better neural circuits

41:48.280 --> 41:50.320
 that really are built out of understanding

41:50.320 --> 41:52.240
 of how this process really works.

41:52.240 --> 41:57.000
 And it's hard to predict how complex this really will be.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.200
 I really don't think we're so far from,

42:00.200 --> 42:01.200
 it makes me laugh, really.

42:01.200 --> 42:05.120
 It's really that far from building the human brain.

42:05.120 --> 42:07.800
 But you're gonna be building something

42:07.800 --> 42:11.600
 that is always a bad version of it,

42:11.600 --> 42:14.840
 but that may have really powerful properties

42:14.840 --> 42:18.560
 and might be able to respond to stimuli

42:18.560 --> 42:21.720
 or be used in certain context.

42:21.720 --> 42:23.680
 And this is why I really think

42:23.680 --> 42:25.800
 that there is no other way to do this science,

42:25.800 --> 42:28.200
 but within the right ethical framework,

42:28.200 --> 42:30.600
 because where you're going with this is also,

42:31.520 --> 42:34.080
 we can talk about science fiction and write that book,

42:34.080 --> 42:36.600
 and we could today,

42:36.600 --> 42:41.520
 but this work happens in a specific ethical framework

42:41.520 --> 42:43.200
 that we don't decide just as scientists,

42:43.200 --> 42:44.880
 but also as a society.

42:44.880 --> 42:48.560
 So the ethical framework here is a fascinating one,

42:48.560 --> 42:49.720
 is a complicated one.

42:49.720 --> 42:51.120
 Yes.

42:51.120 --> 42:53.320
 Do you have a sense, a grasp

42:53.320 --> 42:58.320
 of how we think about ethically of building organoids

43:00.040 --> 43:04.160
 from human stem cells to understand the brain?

43:04.160 --> 43:06.280
 It seems like a tool

43:06.280 --> 43:11.080
 for helping potentially millions of people cure diseases

43:11.080 --> 43:14.960
 or at least start the cure by understanding it.

43:14.960 --> 43:17.840
 But is there more, is there gray areas

43:17.840 --> 43:22.400
 that we have to think about ethically?

43:22.400 --> 43:23.240
 Absolutely.

43:23.240 --> 43:25.600
 We must think about that.

43:25.600 --> 43:29.640
 Every discussion about the ethics of this

43:29.640 --> 43:32.720
 needs to be based on actual data

43:32.720 --> 43:34.520
 from the models that we have today

43:34.520 --> 43:36.360
 and from the ones that we will have tomorrow.

43:36.360 --> 43:37.880
 So it's a continuous conversation.

43:37.880 --> 43:39.880
 It's not something that you decide now.

43:39.880 --> 43:42.080
 Today, there is no issue really.

43:42.080 --> 43:47.080
 Very simple models that clearly can help you in many ways

43:47.320 --> 43:49.920
 without much think about,

43:49.920 --> 43:52.240
 but tomorrow we need to have another conversation

43:52.240 --> 43:53.080
 and so on and so forth.

43:53.080 --> 43:54.680
 And so the way we do this

43:54.680 --> 43:57.920
 is to actually really bring together constantly

43:57.920 --> 44:00.440
 a group of people that are not only scientists,

44:00.440 --> 44:03.400
 but also bioethicists, the lawyers, philosophers,

44:03.400 --> 44:04.880
 psychiatrists and so on,

44:04.880 --> 44:06.720
 psychologists and so on and so forth

44:06.720 --> 44:11.720
 to decide as a society really what we should

44:13.040 --> 44:15.320
 and what we should not do.

44:15.320 --> 44:17.600
 So that's the way to think about the ethics.

44:17.600 --> 44:21.240
 Now, I also think though, that as a scientist,

44:21.240 --> 44:23.720
 I have a moral responsibility.

44:23.720 --> 44:28.720
 So if you think about how transformative it could be

44:29.480 --> 44:34.120
 for understanding and curing a neuropsychiatric disease,

44:34.120 --> 44:37.320
 to be able to actually watch and study

44:37.320 --> 44:40.640
 and treat with drugs the very brain

44:40.640 --> 44:43.240
 of the patient that you are trying to study.

44:43.240 --> 44:47.200
 How transformative at this moment in time this could be.

44:47.200 --> 44:48.760
 We couldn't do it five years ago,

44:48.760 --> 44:50.720
 we could do it now, right?

44:50.720 --> 44:51.560
 If we didn't do it.

44:51.560 --> 44:52.960
 Taking a stem cell of a particular patient.

44:52.960 --> 44:56.120
 Patient and make an organoid for a simple

44:56.120 --> 44:58.880
 and different from the human brain,

44:58.880 --> 45:02.160
 it still is his process of brain development

45:02.160 --> 45:04.720
 with his or her genetics.

45:04.720 --> 45:08.320
 And we could understand perhaps what is going wrong.

45:08.320 --> 45:09.960
 Perhaps we could use as a platform,

45:09.960 --> 45:12.160
 as a cellular platform to screen for drugs,

45:12.160 --> 45:15.280
 to fix a process and so on and so forth, right?

45:15.280 --> 45:18.840
 So we could do it now, we couldn't do it five years ago.

45:18.840 --> 45:20.480
 Should we not do it?

45:20.480 --> 45:24.760
 What is the downside of doing it?

45:24.760 --> 45:27.320
 I don't see a downside at this very moment.

45:27.320 --> 45:30.040
 If we invited a lot of people,

45:30.040 --> 45:33.440
 I'm sure there would be somebody who would argue against it.

45:33.440 --> 45:37.920
 What would be the devil's advocate argument?

45:37.920 --> 45:39.680
 Yeah, yeah.

45:39.680 --> 45:42.960
 So it's exactly perhaps what you alluded at

45:42.960 --> 45:44.280
 with your question,

45:44.280 --> 45:51.280
 that you are enabling some process of formation of the brain

45:51.640 --> 45:54.400
 that could be misused at some point,

45:54.400 --> 45:59.040
 or that could be showing properties

45:59.040 --> 46:03.960
 that ethically we don't wanna see in a tissue.

46:03.960 --> 46:07.720
 So today, I repeat, today, this is not an issue.

46:07.720 --> 46:11.680
 And so you just gain dramatically from the science without,

46:11.680 --> 46:15.240
 because the system is so simple and so different

46:15.240 --> 46:17.800
 in a way from the actual brain.

46:17.800 --> 46:19.960
 But because it is the brain,

46:19.960 --> 46:23.920
 we have an obligation to really consider all of this, right?

46:23.920 --> 46:27.160
 And again, it's a balanced conversation

46:27.160 --> 46:30.320
 where we should put disease and betterment of humanity

46:30.320 --> 46:32.400
 also on that plate.

46:32.400 --> 46:35.400
 What do you think, at least historically,

46:35.400 --> 46:37.240
 there was some politicization,

46:37.240 --> 46:42.240
 politicization of embryonic stem cells,

46:44.280 --> 46:46.480
 a stem cell research.

46:46.480 --> 46:49.440
 Do you still see that out there?

46:49.440 --> 46:53.520
 Is that still a force that we have to think about,

46:53.520 --> 46:55.520
 especially in this larger discourse

46:55.520 --> 46:57.520
 that we're having about the role of science

46:57.520 --> 47:00.560
 in at least American society?

47:00.560 --> 47:03.440
 Yeah, this is a very good question.

47:03.440 --> 47:04.960
 It's very, very important.

47:04.960 --> 47:08.440
 I see a very central role for scientists

47:08.440 --> 47:12.000
 to inform decisions about what we should

47:12.000 --> 47:14.400
 or should not do in society.

47:14.400 --> 47:16.360
 And this is because the scientists

47:16.360 --> 47:20.400
 have the firsthand look and understanding

47:20.400 --> 47:23.480
 of really the work that they are doing.

47:23.480 --> 47:26.040
 And again, this varies depending on

47:26.040 --> 47:27.440
 what we're talking about here.

47:27.440 --> 47:31.080
 So now we're talking about brain organoids.

47:31.080 --> 47:33.760
 I think that the scientists need to be part

47:33.760 --> 47:36.480
 of that conversation about what is,

47:36.480 --> 47:37.960
 will be allowed in the future

47:37.960 --> 47:40.760
 or not allowed in the future to do with the system.

47:40.760 --> 47:43.320
 And I think that is very, very important

47:43.320 --> 47:47.840
 because they bring the reality of data to the conversation.

47:48.840 --> 47:51.640
 And so they should have a voice.

47:51.640 --> 47:53.320
 So data should have a voice.

47:53.320 --> 47:55.160
 Data needs to have a voice.

47:55.160 --> 47:57.280
 Because in not only data,

47:57.280 --> 48:01.120
 we should also be good at communicating

48:01.120 --> 48:04.200
 with non scientists, the data.

48:04.200 --> 48:06.800
 So there has been often time,

48:06.800 --> 48:11.000
 there is a lot of discussion and, you know,

48:11.000 --> 48:16.000
 excitement and fights about certain topics

48:16.280 --> 48:19.280
 just because of the way they are described.

48:19.280 --> 48:20.960
 I'll give you an example.

48:20.960 --> 48:23.360
 If I called the same cellular system

48:23.360 --> 48:27.040
 we just talked about a brain organoid,

48:27.040 --> 48:30.280
 or if I called it a human mini brain,

48:30.280 --> 48:34.560
 your reaction is gonna be very different to this.

48:34.560 --> 48:37.720
 And so the way the systems are described,

48:37.720 --> 48:42.480
 I mean, we and journalists alike need to be a bit careful

48:42.480 --> 48:46.040
 that this debate is a real debate and informed by real data.

48:46.040 --> 48:47.920
 That's all I'm asking.

48:47.920 --> 48:49.560
 And yeah, the language matters here.

48:49.560 --> 48:51.280
 So I work on autonomous vehicles

48:51.280 --> 48:53.000
 and there the use of language

48:53.000 --> 48:56.440
 could drastically change the interpretation

48:56.440 --> 48:58.480
 and the way people feel about

48:58.480 --> 49:01.480
 what is the right way to proceed forward.

49:01.480 --> 49:06.200
 You are, as I've seen from a presentation, you're a parent.

49:06.200 --> 49:09.800
 I saw you show a couple of pictures of your son.

49:09.800 --> 49:11.400
 Is it just the one?

49:11.400 --> 49:12.240
 Two.

49:12.240 --> 49:13.080
 Two.

49:13.080 --> 49:13.920
 Son and a daughter.

49:13.920 --> 49:14.760
 Son and a daughter.

49:14.760 --> 49:17.320
 So what have you learned from the human brain

49:17.320 --> 49:20.040
 by raising two of them?

49:20.040 --> 49:22.640
 More than I could ever learn in the lab.

49:24.480 --> 49:25.560
 What have I learned?

49:25.560 --> 49:27.480
 I've learned that children really have

49:27.480 --> 49:30.480
 these amazing plastic minds, right?

49:30.480 --> 49:34.800
 That we have a responsibility to, you know,

49:34.800 --> 49:37.440
 foster their growth in good, healthy ways.

49:38.360 --> 49:41.360
 That keep them curious, that keeps them adventurous,

49:41.360 --> 49:44.800
 that doesn't raise them in fear of things.

49:45.800 --> 49:47.920
 But also respecting who they are,

49:47.920 --> 49:49.040
 which is in part, you know,

49:49.040 --> 49:51.360
 coming from the genetics we talked about.

49:51.360 --> 49:53.560
 My children are very different from each other

49:53.560 --> 49:55.560
 despite the fact that they're the product of

49:55.560 --> 49:56.920
 the same two parents.

49:58.440 --> 50:03.440
 I also learned that what you do for them comes back to you.

50:03.440 --> 50:05.000
 Like, you know, if you're a good parent,

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
 you're gonna, most of the time,

50:08.000 --> 50:11.240
 have, you know, perhaps a decent kids at the end.

50:11.240 --> 50:12.960
 So what do you think, just a quick comment,

50:12.960 --> 50:16.920
 what do you think is the source of that difference?

50:16.920 --> 50:20.400
 That's often the surprising thing for parents.

50:20.400 --> 50:23.880
 Is that they can't believe that our kids,

50:23.880 --> 50:26.360
 oh, they're so different,

50:26.360 --> 50:28.000
 yet they came from the same parents.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.560
 Well, they are genetically different.

50:29.560 --> 50:31.880
 Even they came from the same two parents

50:31.880 --> 50:33.600
 because the mixing of gametes,

50:33.600 --> 50:35.640
 you know, we know this genetics,

50:35.640 --> 50:39.760
 creates every time a genetically different individual,

50:39.760 --> 50:43.680
 which will have a specific mix of genes

50:43.680 --> 50:46.480
 that is a different mix every time from the two parents.

50:46.480 --> 50:50.280
 And so they're not twins.

50:50.280 --> 50:52.800
 They are genetically different.

50:52.800 --> 50:55.320
 Even just that little bit of variation,

50:55.320 --> 50:58.320
 because you said really from a biological perspective,

50:58.320 --> 51:00.600
 the brains look pretty similar.

51:00.600 --> 51:02.400
 Well, so let me clarify that.

51:02.400 --> 51:05.440
 So the genetics you have, the genes that you have,

51:05.440 --> 51:08.680
 that play that beautiful orchestrated symphony

51:08.680 --> 51:12.040
 of development, different genes

51:12.040 --> 51:13.920
 will play it slightly differently.

51:13.920 --> 51:16.120
 It's like playing the same piece of music,

51:16.120 --> 51:20.000
 but with a different orchestra and a different director.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.480
 The music will not come out.

51:21.480 --> 51:25.440
 It will be still a piece by the same author,

51:25.440 --> 51:27.080
 but it will come out differently

51:27.080 --> 51:28.960
 if it's played by the high school orchestra

51:28.960 --> 51:33.480
 instead of the Scala in Milan.

51:34.680 --> 51:39.360
 And so you are born superficially with the same brain.

51:39.360 --> 51:41.240
 It has the same cell types,

51:41.240 --> 51:43.440
 similar patterns of connectivity,

51:43.440 --> 51:45.240
 but the properties of the cells

51:45.240 --> 51:47.600
 and how the cells will then react to the environment

51:47.600 --> 51:51.320
 as you experience your world will be also shaped

51:51.320 --> 51:53.680
 by who genetically you are.

51:53.680 --> 51:55.120
 Speaking just as a parent,

51:55.120 --> 51:56.880
 this is not something that comes from my work.

51:56.880 --> 52:01.080
 I think you can tell at birth that these kids are different,

52:01.080 --> 52:04.560
 that they have a different personality in a way, right?

52:05.560 --> 52:08.720
 So both is needed, the genetics,

52:08.720 --> 52:10.600
 as well as the nurturing afterwards.

52:11.600 --> 52:15.480
 So you are one human with a brain,

52:15.480 --> 52:17.680
 sort of living through the whole mess of it,

52:17.680 --> 52:21.520
 the human condition, full of love, maybe fear,

52:21.520 --> 52:23.400
 ultimately mortal.

52:24.480 --> 52:27.680
 How has studying the brain changed the way you see yourself?

52:27.680 --> 52:30.480
 When you look in the mirror, when you think about your life,

52:30.480 --> 52:33.440
 the fears, the love, when you see your own life,

52:33.440 --> 52:34.640
 your own mortality.

52:34.640 --> 52:37.360
 Yeah, that's a very good question.

52:38.520 --> 52:43.520
 It's almost impossible to dissociate some time for me.

52:43.520 --> 52:46.200
 Some of the things we do or some of the things

52:46.200 --> 52:48.520
 that other people do from,

52:48.520 --> 52:51.400
 oh, that's because that part of the brain

52:52.320 --> 52:54.400
 is working in a certain way.

52:54.400 --> 52:58.120
 Or thinking about a teenager,

52:59.560 --> 53:02.160
 going through teenage years and being at time funny

53:02.160 --> 53:03.840
 in the way they think.

53:03.840 --> 53:07.480
 And impossible for me not to think it's because

53:07.480 --> 53:09.680
 they're going through this period of time

53:09.680 --> 53:13.040
 called critical periods of plasticity

53:13.040 --> 53:16.200
 where their synapses are being eliminated here and there,

53:16.200 --> 53:17.560
 and they're just confused.

53:17.560 --> 53:22.080
 And so from that comes perhaps a different take

53:22.080 --> 53:27.080
 on that behavior, or maybe I can justify it scientifically

53:27.880 --> 53:29.880
 in some sort of way.

53:29.880 --> 53:32.080
 I also look at humanity in general,

53:32.080 --> 53:36.840
 and I am amazed by what we can do

53:36.840 --> 53:39.760
 and the kind of ideas that we can come up with.

53:39.760 --> 53:43.480
 And I cannot stop thinking about how the brain

53:43.480 --> 53:46.200
 is continuing to evolve.

53:46.200 --> 53:47.120
 I don't know if you do this,

53:47.120 --> 53:49.480
 but I think about the next brain sometimes.

53:49.480 --> 53:50.880
 Where are we going with this?

53:50.880 --> 53:53.680
 Like, what are the features of this brain

53:53.680 --> 53:57.680
 that evolution is really playing with

53:57.680 --> 54:02.320
 to get us in the future, the new brain?

54:02.320 --> 54:04.040
 It's not over, right?

54:04.040 --> 54:06.960
 It's a work in progress.

54:06.960 --> 54:09.040
 So let me just a quick comment on that.

54:09.040 --> 54:14.040
 Do you think there's a lot of fascination

54:14.240 --> 54:15.960
 and hope for artificial intelligence

54:15.960 --> 54:17.720
 of creating artificial brains?

54:17.720 --> 54:20.080
 You said the next brain.

54:20.080 --> 54:23.360
 When you imagine over a period of a thousand years,

54:23.360 --> 54:25.480
 the evolution of the human brain,

54:25.480 --> 54:28.680
 do you sometimes envisioning that future

54:28.680 --> 54:32.400
 see an artificial one, artificial intelligence,

54:32.400 --> 54:34.920
 as it is hoped by many, not hoped,

54:34.920 --> 54:37.440
 thought by many people would be actually

54:37.440 --> 54:40.440
 the next evolutionary step in the development of humans?

54:40.440 --> 54:45.240
 Yeah, I think in a way that will happen, right?

54:45.240 --> 54:48.520
 It's almost like a part of the way we evolve.

54:48.520 --> 54:51.160
 We evolve in the world that we created,

54:51.160 --> 54:55.280
 that we interact with, that shape us as we grow up

54:55.280 --> 54:56.480
 and so on and so forth.

54:58.200 --> 55:00.880
 Sometime I think about something that may sound silly,

55:00.880 --> 55:04.480
 but think about the use of cell phones.

55:04.480 --> 55:07.000
 Part of me thinks that somehow in their brain,

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
 there will be a region of the cortex

55:09.000 --> 55:13.560
 that is attuned to that tool.

55:13.560 --> 55:16.440
 And this comes from a lot of studies

55:16.440 --> 55:20.840
 in modern organisms where really the cortex,

55:20.840 --> 55:24.080
 especially adapts to the kind of things you have to do.

55:24.080 --> 55:28.440
 So if we need to move our fingers in a very specific way,

55:28.440 --> 55:30.600
 we have a part of our cortex that allows us

55:30.600 --> 55:32.880
 to do this kind of very precise movement.

55:34.200 --> 55:36.800
 An owl that has to see very, very far away

55:36.800 --> 55:39.800
 with big eyes, the visual cortex, very big.

55:39.800 --> 55:43.120
 The brain attunes to your environment.

55:43.120 --> 55:47.440
 So the brain will attune to the technologies

55:47.440 --> 55:51.040
 that we will have and will be shaped by it.

55:51.040 --> 55:52.800
 So the cortex very well may be.

55:52.800 --> 55:54.480
 Will be shaped by it.

55:54.480 --> 55:57.200
 In artificial intelligence, it may merge with it,

55:57.200 --> 56:01.120
 it may get, envelop it and adjust.

56:01.120 --> 56:04.040
 Even if it's not a merge of the kind of,

56:04.040 --> 56:06.800
 oh, let's have a synthetic element together

56:06.800 --> 56:08.640
 with a biological one.

56:08.640 --> 56:11.680
 The very space around us, the fact, for example,

56:11.680 --> 56:15.120
 think about we put on some goggles of virtual reality

56:15.120 --> 56:18.680
 and we physically are surfing the ocean, right?

56:18.680 --> 56:19.960
 Like I've done it.

56:19.960 --> 56:22.600
 And you have all these emotions that come to you.

56:22.600 --> 56:27.000
 Your brain placed you in that reality.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.520
 And it was able to do it like that

56:29.520 --> 56:31.000
 just by putting the goggles on.

56:31.000 --> 56:35.840
 It didn't take thousands of years of adapting to this.

56:35.840 --> 56:37.320
 The brain is plastic.

56:37.320 --> 56:39.160
 So adapts to new technology.

56:39.160 --> 56:41.600
 So you could do it from the outside

56:41.600 --> 56:46.600
 by simply hijacking some sensory capacities that we have.

56:47.480 --> 56:51.440
 So clearly over recent evolution,

56:51.440 --> 56:53.800
 the cerebral cortex has been a part of the brain

56:53.800 --> 56:55.840
 that has known the most evolution.

56:55.840 --> 56:58.240
 So we have put a lot of chips

56:58.240 --> 57:02.440
 on evolving this specific part of the brain.

57:02.440 --> 57:05.800
 And the evolution of cortex is plasticity.

57:05.800 --> 57:10.120
 It's this ability to change in response to things.

57:10.120 --> 57:12.240
 So yes, they will integrate.

57:12.240 --> 57:13.640
 That we want it or not.

57:14.800 --> 57:18.000
 Well, there's no better way to end it, Paola.

57:18.000 --> 57:19.320
 Thank you so much for talking today.

57:19.320 --> 57:20.160
 You're very welcome.

57:20.160 --> 57:41.560
 This is very exciting.
