00:00.000 --> 00:02.480
 The following is a conversation with Cal Newport.

00:02.480 --> 00:04.640
 He's a friend and someone who's writing,

00:04.640 --> 00:06.920
 like his book, Deep Work, for example,

00:06.920 --> 00:09.600
 has guided how I strive to approach productivity

00:09.600 --> 00:11.200
 and life in general.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.120
 He doesn't use social media,

00:13.120 --> 00:15.600
 and in his book, Digital Minimalism,

00:15.600 --> 00:17.760
 he encourages people to find the right amount

00:17.760 --> 00:21.120
 of social media usage that provides value and joy.

00:21.120 --> 00:24.720
 He has a new book out called A World Without Email,

00:24.720 --> 00:27.240
 where he argues brilliantly, I would say,

00:27.240 --> 00:30.120
 that email is destroying productivity in companies

00:30.120 --> 00:31.680
 and in our lives.

00:31.680 --> 00:35.480
 And very importantly, he offers solutions.

00:35.480 --> 00:38.720
 He is a computer scientist at Georgetown University

00:38.720 --> 00:41.080
 who practices what he preaches.

00:41.080 --> 00:42.840
 To do theoretical computer science

00:42.840 --> 00:44.560
 at the level that he does it,

00:44.560 --> 00:46.800
 you really have to live a focused life

00:46.800 --> 00:48.320
 that minimizes distractions

00:48.320 --> 00:51.120
 and maximizes hours of deep work.

00:51.120 --> 00:54.360
 Lastly, he's a host of an amazing podcast

00:54.360 --> 00:57.640
 called Deep Questions that I highly recommend

00:57.640 --> 01:00.760
 for anyone who wants to improve their productive life.

01:15.480 --> 01:17.440
 As a side note, let me say that deep work

01:17.440 --> 01:20.760
 or long periods of deep, focused thinking

01:20.760 --> 01:22.800
 have been something I've been chasing more and more

01:22.800 --> 01:24.520
 over the past few years.

01:24.520 --> 01:28.040
 Deep work is hard, but is ultimately the thing

01:28.040 --> 01:30.920
 that makes life so damn amazing.

01:30.920 --> 01:33.760
 The ability to create things you're passionate about

01:33.760 --> 01:36.400
 in a flow state where the distractions of the world

01:36.400 --> 01:37.920
 just fade away.

01:37.920 --> 01:41.520
 Social media, yes, reading the comments,

01:41.520 --> 01:43.480
 yes, I still read the comments,

01:43.480 --> 01:46.920
 is a source of joy for me in strict moderation.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.200
 Too much takes away the focused mind

01:49.200 --> 01:51.520
 and too little, at least I think,

01:51.520 --> 01:53.720
 takes away all of the fun.

01:53.720 --> 01:56.920
 We need both, the focus and the fun.

01:56.920 --> 01:59.280

02:06.040 --> 02:08.720
 at Lex Friedman if you can only figure out

02:08.720 --> 02:10.080
 how to spell that.

02:10.080 --> 02:13.960
 And now, here's my conversation with Cal Newport.

02:15.080 --> 02:16.600
 What is deep work?

02:16.600 --> 02:18.920
 Let's start with a big question.

02:18.920 --> 02:21.720
 So I mean, it's my term for when you're focusing

02:21.720 --> 02:25.800
 without distraction on a cognitively demanding task,

02:25.800 --> 02:28.440
 which is something we've all done,

02:28.440 --> 02:31.640
 but we had never really given it a name necessarily

02:31.640 --> 02:33.440
 that was separate from other type of work.

02:33.440 --> 02:36.520
 And so I gave it a name and said,

02:36.520 --> 02:38.440
 let's compare that to other types of efforts

02:38.440 --> 02:40.640
 you might do while you're working

02:40.640 --> 02:43.440
 and see that the deep work efforts actually have

02:43.440 --> 02:45.800
 a huge benefit that we might be underestimating.

02:45.800 --> 02:49.280
 What does it mean to work deeply on something?

02:49.280 --> 02:54.280
 I had been calling it hard focus in my writing before that.

02:54.280 --> 02:55.640
 Well, so the context you would understand,

02:55.640 --> 02:58.320
 I was in the theory group in CSAIL at MIT, right?

02:58.320 --> 02:59.920
 So I was surrounded at the time

02:59.920 --> 03:01.760
 when I was coming up with these ideas

03:01.760 --> 03:03.440
 by these professional theoreticians.

03:03.440 --> 03:06.840
 And that's like a murderer's row of thinkers there, right?

03:06.840 --> 03:08.880
 I mean, it's like Turing Award, Turing Award,

03:08.880 --> 03:10.040
 MacArthur, Turing Award.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.640
 I mean, you know the crew, right?

03:12.640 --> 03:13.840
 Theoretical computer science.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.840
 Theoretical computer science, yeah, yeah.

03:15.840 --> 03:18.080
 So I'm in the theory group, right?

03:18.080 --> 03:21.360
 Doing theoretical computer science and I publish a book.

03:21.360 --> 03:25.400
 So I was in this milieu where I was being exposed to people

03:25.400 --> 03:27.680
 where focus was their tier one skill.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.040
 Like that's what you would talk about, right?

03:29.040 --> 03:31.480
 Like how intensely I can focus.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.360
 That was the key skill.

03:33.360 --> 03:34.800
 It's like your 440 time or something

03:34.800 --> 03:37.120
 if you were an athlete, right?

03:37.120 --> 03:39.080
 So this is something that people actually,

03:39.080 --> 03:41.680
 the theory folks are thinking about?

03:41.680 --> 03:43.000
 Oh yeah. Really?

03:43.000 --> 03:45.840
 Like they're openly discussing like, how do you focus?

03:45.840 --> 03:48.480
 I mean, I don't know if they would quantify it,

03:48.480 --> 03:51.520
 but focus was the tier one skill.

03:51.520 --> 03:53.680
 So you would come in, here would be a typical day.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.440
 You'd come in and Eric DeMain would be sitting

03:56.440 --> 03:58.320
 in front of a whiteboard, right?

03:58.320 --> 04:00.160
 With a whole group of visitors

04:00.160 --> 04:01.280
 who had come to work with them.

04:01.280 --> 04:03.640
 And maybe they projected like a grid on there

04:03.640 --> 04:06.400
 because they're working on some graph theory problem.

04:06.400 --> 04:10.000
 You go to lunch, you go to the gym, you come back,

04:10.000 --> 04:12.960
 they're sitting there staring at the same whiteboard, right?

04:12.960 --> 04:14.240
 Like that's the tier one skill.

04:14.240 --> 04:16.120
 This is the difference between different disciplines.

04:16.120 --> 04:20.640
 Like I often feel for many reasons, like a fraud,

04:20.640 --> 04:22.760
 but I definitely feel like a fraud when I hang out

04:22.760 --> 04:25.440
 with like either mathematicians or physicists.

04:25.440 --> 04:29.000
 It's like, it feels like they're doing the legit work

04:29.000 --> 04:31.240
 because when you talk closer in computer science,

04:31.240 --> 04:33.840
 you get to programming or like machine learning,

04:33.840 --> 04:38.440
 like the experimental machine learning

04:38.440 --> 04:41.120
 or like just the engineering version of it.

04:41.120 --> 04:44.560
 It feels like you're gone so far away

04:44.560 --> 04:47.880
 from what's required to solve something fundamental

04:47.880 --> 04:49.000
 about this universe.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.160
 It feels like you're just like cheating your way

04:51.160 --> 04:53.560
 into like some kind of trick to figure out

04:53.560 --> 04:56.200
 how to solve a problem in this one particular case.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.400
 That's how it feels.

04:59.160 --> 05:02.840
 I'd be interested to hear what you think about that

05:02.840 --> 05:07.080
 because programming doesn't always feel

05:07.080 --> 05:11.480
 like you need to think deeply to work deeply,

05:11.480 --> 05:12.880
 but sometimes it does.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.400
 So it's a weird dance.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.840
 For sure code does, right?

05:15.840 --> 05:17.640
 I mean, especially if you're coming up

05:17.640 --> 05:20.760
 with original algorithmic designs,

05:20.760 --> 05:22.800
 I think it's a great example of deep work.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.080
 I mean, yeah, the hardcore theoreticians,

05:25.080 --> 05:26.520
 they push it to an extreme.

05:26.520 --> 05:29.080
 I mean, I think it's like knowing

05:29.080 --> 05:31.160
 that athletic endeavor is good

05:31.160 --> 05:33.840
 and then hanging out with a Olympic athlete,

05:33.840 --> 05:35.760
 you're like, oh, I see that's what it is.

05:35.760 --> 05:37.200
 Now for the grad students like me,

05:37.200 --> 05:38.800
 we're not anywhere near that level,

05:38.800 --> 05:41.640
 but the faculty in that group,

05:41.640 --> 05:44.720
 these were the cognitive Olympic athletes.

05:44.720 --> 05:48.160
 But coding I think is a classic example of deep work

05:48.160 --> 05:50.960
 because I got this problem I wanna solve,

05:50.960 --> 05:52.320
 I have all of these tools

05:52.320 --> 05:55.880
 and I have to combine them somehow creatively

05:55.880 --> 05:56.720
 and on the fly.

05:56.720 --> 05:59.000
 But so basically I had been exposed to that.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.920
 So I was used to this notion when I was in grad school

06:00.920 --> 06:03.560
 and I was writing my blog, I'd write about hard focus.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.120
 That was the term I used.

06:05.120 --> 06:06.640
 Then I published this book,

06:06.640 --> 06:09.480
 So Good They Can't Ignore You, which came out in 2012.

06:09.480 --> 06:12.240
 So like right as I began as a professor.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.720
 And that book had this notion of skill

06:14.720 --> 06:16.600
 being really important for career satisfaction,

06:16.600 --> 06:19.440
 that it's not just following your passion.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.120
 You have to actually really get good at something

06:21.120 --> 06:22.600
 and then you use that skills as leverage.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.480
 And there was this big followup question to that book

06:24.480 --> 06:27.160
 of, okay, well, how do I get really good at things?

06:27.160 --> 06:29.080
 And then I look back to my grad school experience,

06:29.080 --> 06:31.600
 I was like, huh, there was this focus thing

06:31.600 --> 06:32.440
 that we used to do.

06:32.440 --> 06:35.480
 And I wonder how generally applicable that is

06:35.480 --> 06:36.360
 into the knowledge sector.

06:36.360 --> 06:39.240
 And so as I started thinking about it, it became clear,

06:39.240 --> 06:41.040
 there's this interesting storyline that emerged

06:41.040 --> 06:43.240
 that, okay, actually undistracted concentration

06:43.240 --> 06:46.360
 is not just important for esoteric theoreticians,

06:46.360 --> 06:47.520
 it's important here, it's important here,

06:47.520 --> 06:48.800
 it's important here.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.240
 And that involved into the deep work hypothesis,

06:51.240 --> 06:55.280
 which is across the whole knowledge work sector.

06:55.280 --> 06:56.600
 Focus is very important

06:56.600 --> 06:58.600
 and we've accidentally created circumstances

06:58.600 --> 07:00.560
 where we just don't do a lot of it.

07:00.560 --> 07:03.680
 So focus is the sort of prerequisite for basically,

07:03.680 --> 07:04.520
 you say knowledge work,

07:04.520 --> 07:07.040
 but basically any kind of skill acquisition,

07:07.040 --> 07:09.320
 any kind of major effort in this world.

07:09.320 --> 07:11.640
 Can we break that apart a little bit?

07:11.640 --> 07:15.760
 Yeah, so a key aspect of focus is not just

07:15.760 --> 07:17.840
 that you're concentrating hard on something,

07:17.840 --> 07:20.080
 but you do it without distraction.

07:20.080 --> 07:24.720
 So a big theme of my work is that context shifting

07:24.720 --> 07:27.000
 kills the human capacity to think.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.520
 So if I change what I'm paying attention to

07:29.520 --> 07:32.000
 to something different, really, even if it's brief

07:32.000 --> 07:34.240
 and then try to bring it back to the main thing I'm doing,

07:34.240 --> 07:36.000
 that causes a huge cognitive pile up

07:36.000 --> 07:38.080
 that makes it very hard to think clearly.

07:38.080 --> 07:40.360
 So even if you think, okay, look, I'm writing this code

07:40.360 --> 07:43.600
 or I'm writing this essay and I'm not multitasking

07:43.600 --> 07:45.080
 and all my windows are closed

07:45.080 --> 07:47.080
 and I have no notifications on,

07:47.080 --> 07:50.120
 but every five or six minutes you quickly check

07:50.120 --> 07:51.880
 like an inbox or your phone,

07:51.880 --> 07:54.200
 that initiates a context shift in your brain, right?

07:54.200 --> 07:55.920
 We're gonna start to suppress some neural networks,

07:55.920 --> 07:57.400
 we're gonna try to amplify some others.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.240
 It's a pretty complicated process actually.

07:59.240 --> 08:02.240
 There's a sort of neurological cascade that happens.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.400
 You rip yourself away from that halfway through

08:04.400 --> 08:05.480
 and go back to what you're doing

08:05.480 --> 08:07.120
 and now it's trying to switch back to the original thing

08:07.120 --> 08:08.760
 even though it's also your brain's in the process

08:08.760 --> 08:09.920
 of switching to these emails

08:09.920 --> 08:11.720
 and trying to understand those contexts.

08:11.720 --> 08:14.600
 And as a result, your ability to think clearly

08:14.600 --> 08:16.400
 just goes really down.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.320
 And it's fatiguing too.

08:17.320 --> 08:19.440
 I mean, you do this long enough and you get midday

08:19.440 --> 08:22.080
 and you're like, okay, I can't think anymore.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.240
 You've exhausted yourself.

08:23.240 --> 08:27.920
 Is there some kind of perfect number of minutes,

08:27.920 --> 08:28.880
 would you say?

08:28.880 --> 08:32.320
 So we're talking about focusing on a particular task

08:32.320 --> 08:37.240
 for one minute, five minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes.

08:37.240 --> 08:40.160
 Is it possible to kind of context switch

08:40.160 --> 08:44.280
 while maintaining deep focus every 20 minutes or so?

08:44.280 --> 08:46.600
 So if you're thinking of like this,

08:46.600 --> 08:48.720
 again, maybe it's a selfish kind of perspective,

08:48.720 --> 08:50.440
 but if you think about programming,

08:51.440 --> 08:53.680
 you're focused on a particular design of a little bit,

08:53.680 --> 08:55.920
 maybe a small scale on a particular function

08:55.920 --> 08:59.560
 or large scale on a system.

08:59.560 --> 09:02.840
 And then the shift of focus happens like this,

09:02.840 --> 09:04.960
 which is like, wait a minute,

09:04.960 --> 09:07.440
 is there a library that can achieve this little task

09:07.440 --> 09:08.280
 or something like that?

09:08.280 --> 09:10.200
 And then you have to look it up.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.480
 This is the danger zone.

09:11.480 --> 09:13.040
 You go to the internets.

09:13.040 --> 09:17.040
 And so you have to, now it is a kind of context switch

09:17.040 --> 09:20.000
 because as opposed to thinking about the particular problem,

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
 you now have switch thinking about like consuming

09:25.000 --> 09:27.880
 and integrating knowledge that's out there

09:27.880 --> 09:31.120
 that can plug into your solution to a particular problem.

09:31.120 --> 09:33.520
 It definitely feels like a context switch,

09:33.520 --> 09:35.960
 but is that a really bad thing to do?

09:35.960 --> 09:38.480
 So should you be setting it aside always

09:38.480 --> 09:42.120
 and really trying to as much as possible go deep

09:42.120 --> 09:45.920
 and stay there for like a really long period of time?

09:45.920 --> 09:48.640
 Well, I mean, I think if you're looking up a library

09:48.640 --> 09:51.320
 that's relevant to what you're doing, that's probably okay.

09:51.320 --> 09:52.440
 And I don't know that I would count that

09:52.440 --> 09:56.120
 as a full context shift because the semantic networks

09:56.120 --> 09:58.000
 involved are relatively similar, right?

09:58.000 --> 10:00.520
 You're thinking about this type of solution.

10:00.520 --> 10:01.600
 You're thinking about coding.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.560
 You're thinking about this type of functions.

10:03.560 --> 10:04.600
 Where you're really gonna get hit

10:04.600 --> 10:06.000
 is if you switch your context

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
 to something that's different.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.800
 And if there's unresolved obligations.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.680
 So really the worst possible thing you could do

10:11.680 --> 10:14.320
 would be to look at like an email inbox, right?

10:14.320 --> 10:16.000
 Cause here's 20 emails.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
 I can't answer most of these right now.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.520
 They're completely different.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.160
 Like the context of these emails,

10:21.160 --> 10:22.760
 like, okay, there's a grant funding issue

10:22.760 --> 10:23.600
 or something like this.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.520
 It's very different than the coding I'm doing.

10:25.520 --> 10:27.200
 And I'm leaving it unresolved.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.200
 So like someone needs something from me

10:29.200 --> 10:30.680
 and I'm gonna try to pull my attention back.

10:30.680 --> 10:31.840
 The second worst would be something

10:31.840 --> 10:33.360
 that's emotionally arousing.

10:33.360 --> 10:35.160
 So if you're like, let me just glance over at Twitter.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.520
 I'm sure it's nice and calm and peaceful over there, right?

10:37.520 --> 10:38.560
 That could be devastating

10:38.560 --> 10:39.800
 because you're gonna expose yourself

10:39.800 --> 10:41.560
 to something that's emotionally arousing.

10:41.560 --> 10:43.920
 That's gonna completely mess up the cognitive plateau there.

10:43.920 --> 10:45.040
 And then when you come back to,

10:45.040 --> 10:46.920
 okay, let me try to code again.

10:46.920 --> 10:47.840
 It's really difficult.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.120
 So it's both the information and the emotion.

10:50.120 --> 10:53.440
 Yeah, both can be killers if what you're trying to do.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.960
 So I would recommend at least an hour at a time

10:55.960 --> 10:57.600
 because it could take up to 20 minutes

10:57.600 --> 10:59.320
 to completely clear out the residue

10:59.320 --> 11:02.680
 from whatever it was you were thinking about before.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.040
 So if you're coding for 30 minutes,

11:04.040 --> 11:05.720
 you might only be getting 10 or 15 minutes

11:05.720 --> 11:08.880
 of actual sort of peak lacks going on there, right?

11:08.880 --> 11:11.840
 So an hour at least you get a good 40, 45 minutes plus.

11:11.840 --> 11:15.560
 I'm partial to 90 minutes as a really good chunk.

11:15.560 --> 11:16.960
 We can get a lot done.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.640
 But just before you get exhausted,

11:18.640 --> 11:21.200
 you can sort of pull back a little bit.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.880
 Yeah, and one of the beautiful,

11:23.880 --> 11:27.440
 people can read about it in your book, Deep Work.

11:27.440 --> 11:29.520
 And I know this has been out for a long time

11:29.520 --> 11:31.920
 and people are probably familiar with many of the concepts,

11:31.920 --> 11:33.800
 but it's still pretty profound

11:33.800 --> 11:35.840
 and it has stayed with me for a long time.

11:36.880 --> 11:39.360
 There's something about adding the terms to it

11:39.360 --> 11:42.120
 that actually solidifies the concepts.

11:42.120 --> 11:44.320
 Like words matter, it's pretty cool.

11:44.320 --> 11:47.600
 And just for me, sort of as a comment,

11:47.600 --> 11:52.600
 there's, it's a struggle and it's very difficult

11:52.640 --> 11:56.120
 to maintain focus for a prolonged period of time.

11:56.120 --> 11:59.320
 But the days on which I'm able to accomplish

11:59.320 --> 12:03.320
 several hours of that kind of work, I'm happy.

12:03.320 --> 12:05.520
 So forget being productive and all that.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.840
 I'm just satisfied with my life.

12:07.840 --> 12:11.520
 I feel fulfilled, it's like joyful.

12:11.520 --> 12:14.400
 And then I can be, I'm less of a dick

12:14.400 --> 12:16.600
 to other people in my life afterwards.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.120
 It's a beautiful thing.

12:19.120 --> 12:23.800
 And I find the opposite when I don't do that kind of thing,

12:23.800 --> 12:25.480
 I'm much more irritable.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.320
 Like I feel like I didn't accomplish anything

12:27.320 --> 12:30.120
 and there's this stress that then the negative emotion

12:30.120 --> 12:32.040
 builds up to where you're no longer able

12:32.040 --> 12:35.480
 to sort of enjoy the hell out of this amazing life.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.880
 So in that sense, Deep Work has been a source

12:37.880 --> 12:39.640
 of a lot of happiness.

12:39.640 --> 12:42.280
 I'd love to ask you, how do you,

12:42.280 --> 12:43.480
 again, you cover this in the book,

12:43.480 --> 12:46.480
 but how do you integrate Deep Work into your life?

12:46.480 --> 12:48.560
 What are different scheduling strategies

12:48.560 --> 12:51.160
 that you would recommend just at a high level?

12:51.160 --> 12:52.560
 What are different ideas there?

12:52.560 --> 12:55.280
 Well, I mean, I'm a big fan of time blocking, right?

12:55.280 --> 12:58.480
 So if you're facing your workday,

12:58.480 --> 13:02.080
 don't allow like your inbox or a to do list

13:02.080 --> 13:02.920
 to sort of drive you.

13:02.920 --> 13:04.080
 Don't just come into your day and think,

13:04.080 --> 13:05.840
 what do I wanna do next?

13:05.840 --> 13:06.800
 I mean, I'm a big planner saying,

13:06.800 --> 13:11.480
 here's the time available, let me make a plan for it.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.400
 So I have a meeting here, I have an appointment here,

13:13.400 --> 13:15.400
 here's what's left, what do I actually wanna do with it?

13:15.400 --> 13:17.960
 So in this half hour, I'm gonna work on this.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.680
 For this 90 minute block, I'm gonna work on that.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.320
 And during this hour, I'm gonna try to fit this in.

13:21.320 --> 13:22.680
 And then actually I have this half hour gap

13:22.680 --> 13:23.520
 between two meetings.

13:23.520 --> 13:24.680
 So why don't I take advantage of that

13:24.680 --> 13:25.800
 to go run five errands,

13:25.800 --> 13:27.720
 I can kind of batch those together.

13:27.720 --> 13:30.120
 But blocking out in advance,

13:30.120 --> 13:32.480
 this is what I wanna do with the time available.

13:32.480 --> 13:33.760
 I mean, I find that's much more effective.

13:33.760 --> 13:34.600
 Now, once you're doing this,

13:34.600 --> 13:36.320
 once you're in a discipline of time blocking,

13:36.320 --> 13:37.800
 it's much easier to actually see,

13:37.800 --> 13:40.160
 this is where I want, for example, the Deep Work.

13:40.160 --> 13:41.840
 And I can get a handle on the other things

13:41.840 --> 13:44.920
 that need to happen and find better places to fit them

13:44.920 --> 13:46.120
 so I can prioritize this.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.560
 And you're gonna get a lot more of that done

13:48.560 --> 13:49.680
 than if it's just going through your day

13:49.680 --> 13:51.400
 and saying, what's next?

13:51.400 --> 13:53.440
 I schedule every single day kind of thing.

13:53.440 --> 13:54.920
 So as I could try to do in the morning

13:54.920 --> 13:57.040
 to try to have a plan.

13:57.040 --> 14:00.320
 Yeah, so I do a quarterly, weekly, daily planning.

14:00.320 --> 14:02.360
 So at the semester or quarterly level,

14:02.360 --> 14:04.840
 I have a big picture vision

14:04.840 --> 14:06.800
 for what I'm trying to get done during the fall,

14:06.800 --> 14:08.640
 let's say, or during the winter.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.240
 Like there's a deadline coming up for academic papers

14:11.240 --> 14:13.480
 at the end of the season, here's what I'm working on.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.280
 I wanna have this many chapters done of a book,

14:15.280 --> 14:16.120
 something like this.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.200
 Like you have the big picture vision

14:18.200 --> 14:20.040
 of what you wanna get done.

14:20.040 --> 14:22.200
 Then weekly, you look at that,

14:22.200 --> 14:23.920
 and then you look at your week

14:23.920 --> 14:25.080
 and you put together a plan for like,

14:25.080 --> 14:27.200
 okay, what's my week gonna look like?

14:27.200 --> 14:28.320
 What do I need to do?

14:28.320 --> 14:29.880
 How am I gonna make progress on these things?

14:29.880 --> 14:32.640
 Maybe I need to do an hour every morning

14:32.640 --> 14:34.640
 or I see that Monday is my only really empty day.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.440
 So that's gonna be the day that I really need to nail

14:36.440 --> 14:38.080
 on writing or something like this.

14:38.080 --> 14:41.160
 And then every day, you look at your weekly plan

14:41.160 --> 14:42.760
 and say, let me block off the actual hours.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.760
 So you do that three scales,

14:44.760 --> 14:47.880
 the quarterly, down to weekly, down to daily.

14:47.880 --> 14:50.840
 And we're talking about actual times of day versus,

14:50.840 --> 14:55.120
 so the alternative is what I end up doing a lot,

14:55.120 --> 14:56.680
 and I'm not sure it's the best way to do it,

14:56.680 --> 15:01.680
 is scheduling the duration of time.

15:01.760 --> 15:04.560
 This is called the luxury when you don't have any meetings.

15:04.560 --> 15:07.880
 I'm like, religiously don't do meetings.

15:07.880 --> 15:09.880
 All other academics are jealous of you, by the way.

15:09.880 --> 15:11.560
 Yeah. I know.

15:11.560 --> 15:13.480
 No Zoom meetings.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.360
 I find those are,

15:15.360 --> 15:19.880
 that's one of the worst tragedies of the pandemic,

15:19.880 --> 15:21.880
 is both the opportunity to,

15:21.880 --> 15:25.760
 the positive thing is to have more time with your family,

15:25.760 --> 15:27.320
 sort of reconnect in many ways.

15:27.320 --> 15:28.960
 And that's really interesting.

15:29.880 --> 15:34.120
 Be able to remotely sort of not waste time on travel

15:34.120 --> 15:35.200
 and all those kinds of things.

15:35.200 --> 15:38.440
 The negative is, actually both those things

15:38.440 --> 15:40.400
 are also sourced from the negative.

15:40.400 --> 15:41.760
 But the negative is like,

15:41.760 --> 15:44.280
 it seems like people have multiplied the number of meetings

15:44.280 --> 15:46.240
 because they're so easy to schedule.

15:46.240 --> 15:50.920
 And there's nothing more draining to me intellectually,

15:50.920 --> 15:55.600
 philosophically, just my spirit is destroyed

15:55.600 --> 15:57.880
 by even a 10 minute Zoom meeting.

15:57.880 --> 15:59.760
 Like, what are we doing here?

15:59.760 --> 16:01.760
 What's the meaning of life?

16:01.760 --> 16:04.000
 Yeah, I have, every Zoom meeting is,

16:04.000 --> 16:05.720
 I have an existential crisis, so.

16:05.720 --> 16:08.200
 Kierkegaard with the internet connection.

16:08.200 --> 16:13.200
 So, what the hell are we talking about?

16:13.760 --> 16:16.680
 Oh, so when you don't have meetings,

16:16.680 --> 16:21.520
 there's a luxury to really allow for certain things

16:21.520 --> 16:25.040
 if they need to, like the important things,

16:25.040 --> 16:27.960
 like deep work sessions to last way longer

16:27.960 --> 16:30.800
 than you maybe planned for.

16:30.800 --> 16:33.280
 I mean, that's my goal is to try to schedule,

16:33.280 --> 16:34.560
 the goal is to schedule,

16:34.560 --> 16:37.440
 to sit and focus for a particular task for an hour

16:37.440 --> 16:41.920
 and hope I can keep going and hope I can get lost in it.

16:41.920 --> 16:46.920
 And do you find that this is at all an okay way to go

16:48.240 --> 16:51.800
 and the time blocking is just something you have to do

16:51.800 --> 16:54.880
 to actually be an adult and operate in this real world?

16:54.880 --> 16:57.960
 Or is there some magic to the time blocking?

16:57.960 --> 17:00.480
 Well, I mean, there's magic to the intention.

17:01.360 --> 17:05.000
 There's magic to it if you have varied responsibilities.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.760
 So I'm often juggling multiple jobs, essentially.

17:08.760 --> 17:11.120
 There's academic stuff, there's teaching stuff,

17:11.120 --> 17:13.520
 there's book stuff, there's the business

17:13.520 --> 17:16.520
 surrounding my book stuff.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.960
 But I'm of your same mindset.

17:18.960 --> 17:22.200
 If a deep work session is going well,

17:22.200 --> 17:24.480
 you just rock and roll and let it go on.

17:24.480 --> 17:26.360
 So like one of the big keys of time block,

17:26.360 --> 17:27.240
 at least the way I do it,

17:27.240 --> 17:30.640
 so I even sell this planner to help people time block,

17:30.640 --> 17:32.920
 it has many columns because the discipline is,

17:32.920 --> 17:35.920
 oh, if your initial schedule changes,

17:35.920 --> 17:36.840
 you just move over one.

17:36.840 --> 17:38.920
 Next time you get a chance, you move over one column

17:38.920 --> 17:41.240
 and then you just fix it for the time that's remaining.

17:41.240 --> 17:43.080
 So in other words, there's no bonus

17:43.080 --> 17:46.280
 for I made a schedule and I stuck with it.

17:46.280 --> 17:47.120
 Like there's actually,

17:47.120 --> 17:48.600
 it's not like you get a prize for it, right?

17:48.600 --> 17:51.840
 Like for me, the prize is I have an intentional plan

17:51.840 --> 17:54.640
 for my time and if I have to change that plan, that's fine.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.280
 Like the state I wanna be is basically

17:56.280 --> 17:57.840
 at any point in the day, I've thought about

17:57.840 --> 18:00.600
 what time remains and gave it some thought

18:00.600 --> 18:02.080
 for what to do because I'll do the same thing,

18:02.080 --> 18:04.640
 even though I have a lot more meetings

18:04.640 --> 18:06.920
 and other types of things I have to do in my various jobs

18:06.920 --> 18:09.680
 and I basically prioritize the deep work

18:09.680 --> 18:11.080
 and they get yelled at a lot.

18:11.080 --> 18:12.760
 So that's kind of my strategy is like,

18:12.760 --> 18:15.560
 just be okay, just be okay getting yelled at a lot

18:15.560 --> 18:18.120
 because I feel you, if you're rolling, yeah.

18:18.120 --> 18:20.200
 Well, that's what it is for me, like with writing,

18:20.200 --> 18:22.120
 I think it's writing so hard in a certain way

18:22.120 --> 18:24.880
 that it's, you don't really get on a roll in some sense,

18:24.880 --> 18:28.400
 like it's just difficult, but working on proofs,

18:28.400 --> 18:32.320
 it's very hard to pull yourself away from a proof

18:32.320 --> 18:33.880
 if you start to get some traction,

18:33.880 --> 18:35.480
 just you've been at it for a couple of hours

18:35.480 --> 18:37.760
 and you feel the pins and tumblers

18:37.760 --> 18:40.480
 starting to click together and progress is being made,

18:40.480 --> 18:42.360
 it's really hard to pull away from that.

18:42.360 --> 18:45.160
 So I'm willing to get yelled at by almost everyone.

18:45.160 --> 18:48.520
 Of course, there is also a positive effect

18:48.520 --> 18:53.160
 to pulling yourself out of it when things are going great

18:53.160 --> 18:55.640
 because then you're kind of excited to resume.

18:55.640 --> 18:56.480
 Yeah.

18:56.480 --> 18:58.600
 Like stopping on a dead end.

18:58.600 --> 18:59.440
 That's true.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.440
 There's an extra force of procrastination

19:05.440 --> 19:07.560
 that comes with if you stop on a dead end

19:07.560 --> 19:08.920
 to return to the task.

19:08.920 --> 19:10.840
 Yeah, or a cold start.

19:10.840 --> 19:11.680
 Yeah.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.280
 Whenever I feel like I'm in a stage now,

19:13.280 --> 19:15.400
 I submitted a few papers recently.

19:15.400 --> 19:18.600
 So now we're sort of starting something up from cold

19:18.600 --> 19:20.520
 and it takes way too long to get going

19:20.520 --> 19:23.720
 because it's very hard to get the motivation

19:23.720 --> 19:25.840
 to schedule a time when it's not, yeah, we're in it.

19:25.840 --> 19:26.840
 Like here's where we are.

19:26.840 --> 19:28.280
 We feel like something's about to give here.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.600
 We need the very early stages where it's just,

19:30.600 --> 19:32.840
 I don't know, I'm gonna read hard papers

19:32.840 --> 19:34.080
 and it's gonna be hard to understand them

19:34.080 --> 19:35.600
 and I'm gonna have no idea how to make progress.

19:35.600 --> 19:38.440
 It's not motivating.

19:38.440 --> 19:39.680
 What about deadlines?

19:39.680 --> 19:42.720
 Can we, okay, so this is like a therapy session.

19:46.200 --> 19:50.120
 It seems like I only get stuff done that has deadlines.

19:50.120 --> 19:53.200
 And so one of the implied powerful things

19:53.200 --> 19:56.120
 about time blocking is there's a kind of deadline

19:56.120 --> 19:59.880
 or there's a artificial or real sense of urgency.

19:59.880 --> 20:02.760
 Do you think it's possible to get anything done

20:02.760 --> 20:04.200
 in this world without deadlines?

20:04.200 --> 20:06.120
 Why do deadlines work so well?

20:06.120 --> 20:08.440
 Well, I mean, it's a clear motivational signal,

20:08.440 --> 20:12.040
 but in the short term, you do get an effect like that

20:12.040 --> 20:12.880
 in time blocking.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.440
 I think the strong effect you get by saying,

20:15.440 --> 20:18.120
 this is the exact time I'm gonna work on this,

20:18.120 --> 20:20.000
 is that you don't have the debate with yourself

20:20.000 --> 20:23.600
 every three minutes about, should I take a break now?

20:23.600 --> 20:25.000
 This is the big issue with just saying,

20:25.000 --> 20:26.280
 I'm gonna go write.

20:26.280 --> 20:27.760
 I'm gonna write for a while and that's it

20:27.760 --> 20:28.680
 because your mind is saying,

20:28.680 --> 20:30.920
 well, obviously we're gonna take some breaks.

20:30.920 --> 20:32.360
 We're not just gonna write forever.

20:32.360 --> 20:34.200
 And so why not right now?

20:34.200 --> 20:35.160
 You have to be like, well, not right now.

20:35.160 --> 20:36.320
 Let's go a little bit longer, five minutes.

20:36.320 --> 20:37.400
 So why don't we just take a break now?

20:37.400 --> 20:38.800
 We should probably look at the internet.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.240
 Now you have to constantly have this battle.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.440
 On the other hand, if you're in a time block schedule,

20:42.440 --> 20:44.280
 I've got these two hours put aside for writing.

20:44.280 --> 20:46.000
 That's what I'm supposed to be doing.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.280
 I have a break scheduled over here.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.040
 I don't have to fight with myself, right?

20:50.040 --> 20:51.280
 And maybe at a larger scale,

20:51.280 --> 20:53.720
 deadlines give you a similar sort of effect.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.320
 I know this is what I'm supposed to be working on

20:55.320 --> 20:57.960
 because it's due.

20:57.960 --> 21:01.200
 Perhaps, but will you describe it as much healthier

21:01.200 --> 21:02.880
 sort of giving yourself over,

21:02.880 --> 21:05.640
 and you talk about this in the new email book,

21:05.640 --> 21:07.160
 the process, I mean, in general,

21:07.160 --> 21:09.800
 you talk about it all over, is creating a process

21:09.800 --> 21:13.440
 and then giving yourself over to the process.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.600
 But then you have to be strict with yourself.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.640
 Yeah, but what are the deadlines you're talking about?

21:19.640 --> 21:20.600
 It's like with papers,

21:20.600 --> 21:22.760
 like what's the main type of deadline work?

21:24.520 --> 21:26.240
 Well, so papers, definitely,

21:26.240 --> 21:31.360
 but publications, like say this podcast,

21:31.360 --> 21:35.240
 I have to publish this podcast early next week,

21:35.240 --> 21:36.680
 one, because your book is coming out.

21:36.680 --> 21:40.040
 I'd love to sort of support this amazing book,

21:40.040 --> 21:45.040
 but the other is I have to fly to Vegas on Thursday

21:45.040 --> 21:47.840
 to run 40 miles with David Goggins.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.920
 And so I want this podcast,

21:50.920 --> 21:54.360
 this conversation we're doing now to be out of my life.

21:54.360 --> 21:56.720
 Like I don't wanna be in a hotel in Vegas,

21:56.720 --> 22:00.240
 like freaking out while David Goggins is yelling.

22:00.240 --> 22:05.240
 On hour 43 of your Tarathon thing.

22:05.240 --> 22:08.640
 But actually it's possible that I still will be doing that

22:08.640 --> 22:11.440
 because that's not a hard, that's a softer deadline, right?

22:11.440 --> 22:12.560
 But those are sort of,

22:12.560 --> 22:15.240
 life imposes these kinds of deadlines.

22:15.240 --> 22:16.080
 Yeah.

22:16.080 --> 22:17.200
 I'm not, so yeah,

22:17.200 --> 22:19.960
 papers are nice because there's an actual deadline.

22:19.960 --> 22:20.800
 Yeah.

22:20.800 --> 22:24.440
 But I am almost referring to like the pressure

22:24.440 --> 22:25.960
 that people put on you.

22:25.960 --> 22:28.720
 Hey man, you said you're gonna get this done two months ago.

22:28.720 --> 22:30.040
 Why haven't you gotten it done?

22:30.040 --> 22:31.640
 I don't see, I don't like that pressure.

22:31.640 --> 22:32.480
 Yeah.

22:32.480 --> 22:33.320
 First of all, I think we can all.

22:33.320 --> 22:34.240
 I hate it too.

22:34.240 --> 22:37.160
 We can agree, by the way, having David Goggins yell at you

22:37.160 --> 22:39.400
 is probably the top productivity technique.

22:39.400 --> 22:42.480
 I think we'd all get a lot more done

22:42.480 --> 22:45.080
 if he was yelling, but see, I don't like that.

22:45.080 --> 22:47.520
 So I will try to get things done early.

22:47.520 --> 22:49.040
 I like having flex.

22:49.040 --> 22:52.960
 I also don't like the idea of this has to get done today.

22:52.960 --> 22:53.800
 Right?

22:53.800 --> 22:56.440
 Like it's due at midnight and we've got a lot to do

22:56.440 --> 22:57.280
 as the night before,

22:57.280 --> 22:59.760
 because then I get in my head about what if I get sick?

22:59.760 --> 23:01.360
 Or like, what if, you know,

23:01.360 --> 23:03.200
 what if I don't get a bad night's sleep

23:03.200 --> 23:04.760
 and I can't think clearly?

23:04.760 --> 23:05.680
 So I like to have the flex.

23:05.680 --> 23:07.440
 So I'm all process.

23:07.440 --> 23:08.920
 And that's like the philosophical aspect

23:08.920 --> 23:09.760
 of that book, Deep Work,

23:09.760 --> 23:13.040
 is that there's something very human and deep

23:13.040 --> 23:15.080
 about just wrangling with the world of ideas.

23:15.080 --> 23:16.480
 I mean, Aristotle talked about this.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.320
 If you go back and read the ethics,

23:18.320 --> 23:20.280
 he's trying to understand the meaning of life

23:20.280 --> 23:22.120
 and he eventually ends up ultimately

23:22.120 --> 23:26.400
 at the human capacity to contemplate deeply.

23:26.400 --> 23:27.920
 It's kind of like a teleological argument.

23:27.920 --> 23:29.480
 It's the things that only humans can do

23:29.480 --> 23:31.680
 and therefore it must be somehow connected to our ends.

23:31.680 --> 23:34.240
 And he said, ultimately that's where he found his meaning,

23:34.240 --> 23:36.480
 but, you know, he's touching on some sort of intimation

23:36.480 --> 23:37.760
 there that's correct.

23:37.760 --> 23:39.600
 And so what I try to build my life around

23:39.600 --> 23:44.360
 is regularly thinking hard about stuff that's interesting.

23:44.360 --> 23:46.360
 Just like if you get a fitness habit going,

23:46.360 --> 23:50.200
 you feel off when you don't do it.

23:50.200 --> 23:51.600
 I try to get that cognitive habit.

23:51.600 --> 23:52.880
 So it's like, I got it.

23:52.880 --> 23:54.280
 I mean, look, I have my bag here somewhere,

23:54.280 --> 23:56.720
 I have my notebook in it because I was thinking

23:56.720 --> 23:58.240
 on the Uber ride over, I was like, you know,

23:58.240 --> 24:00.400
 I could get some, I'm working on this new proof

24:00.400 --> 24:02.680
 and it just, so you train yourself.

24:02.680 --> 24:04.680
 You train yourself to appreciate certain things.

24:04.680 --> 24:08.040
 And then over time, the hope is that it accretes.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.720
 Well, let's talk about some demons

24:09.720 --> 24:13.760
 because I wonder there's like deep work,

24:13.760 --> 24:18.760
 which and the world without email books

24:19.200 --> 24:23.280
 that to me symbolize the life I want to live.

24:23.280 --> 24:24.120
 Okay.

24:24.120 --> 24:26.320
 And then there is, I'm like,

24:26.320 --> 24:29.800
 despite appearances and adult at this point,

24:29.800 --> 24:32.080
 and this is the life I actually live.

24:33.200 --> 24:36.160
 And I'm in constant chaos.

24:36.160 --> 24:37.720
 You said you don't like that anxiety.

24:37.720 --> 24:38.760
 I hate it too.

24:38.760 --> 24:41.240
 But it seems like I'm always in it.

24:41.240 --> 24:42.920
 It's a giant mess.

24:42.920 --> 24:46.520
 It's like, it's almost like whenever I establish,

24:46.520 --> 24:49.280
 whenever I have successful processes for doing deep work,

24:49.280 --> 24:52.000
 I'll add stuff on top of it just to introduce the chaos.

24:52.000 --> 24:52.840
 Yeah.

24:52.840 --> 24:54.080
 And like, I don't want to.

24:54.080 --> 24:54.920
 Yeah.

24:54.920 --> 24:57.480
 But you have to look in the mirror at a certain point

24:57.480 --> 25:00.560
 and you have to say like, who the hell am I?

25:00.560 --> 25:02.400
 Like, I keep doing this.

25:02.400 --> 25:04.640
 Is this something that's fundamental to who I am

25:04.640 --> 25:06.120
 or do I really need to fix this?

25:06.120 --> 25:07.480
 What's the chaos right now?

25:07.480 --> 25:09.840
 Like, I've seen your video about like your routine.

25:09.840 --> 25:12.320
 It seemed very structured and deep.

25:12.320 --> 25:13.640
 In fact, I was really envious of it.

25:13.640 --> 25:17.040
 So like, what's the chaos now that's not in that video?

25:17.040 --> 25:19.080
 Many of those sessions go way longer.

25:19.080 --> 25:20.440
 I don't get enough sleep.

25:20.440 --> 25:21.280
 Yeah.

25:21.280 --> 25:24.080
 And then I, the main introduction of chaos is,

25:24.080 --> 25:26.600
 it's taking on too many things on the to do list.

25:26.600 --> 25:27.800
 I see.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.440
 It's, I mean, I suppose it's a problem

25:29.440 --> 25:30.880
 that everybody deals with,

25:30.880 --> 25:33.400
 which is saying, not saying no.

25:33.400 --> 25:36.880
 But it's not like I have trouble saying no.

25:36.880 --> 25:39.040
 It's that there's so much cool shit in my life.

25:39.040 --> 25:39.880
 Yeah.

25:39.880 --> 25:42.720
 Okay, listen, there's nothing I love more in this world

25:42.720 --> 25:45.320
 than the Boston Dynamics robots.

25:45.320 --> 25:46.960
 Spot and the other, yeah.

25:46.960 --> 25:48.360
 And they're giving me spot.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.320
 So there's a to do, what am I gonna say?

25:50.320 --> 25:51.160
 No.

25:51.160 --> 25:52.000
 Yeah.

25:52.000 --> 25:52.840
 So they're getting me spot

25:52.840 --> 25:54.320
 and I wanna do some computer vision stuff

25:54.320 --> 25:55.480
 for the hell of it.

25:55.480 --> 25:57.520
 Okay, so that's now a to do item.

25:57.520 --> 25:59.000
 And then you go to Texas for a while.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.040
 There's Texas.

26:00.040 --> 26:00.880
 Everything's happening.

26:00.880 --> 26:02.400
 There's all the interesting people down there.

26:02.400 --> 26:03.920
 And then there's surprises, right?

26:03.920 --> 26:05.800
 There are power outages in Texas.

26:05.800 --> 26:07.360
 There's constant changes to plans

26:07.360 --> 26:08.480
 and all those kinds of things.

26:08.480 --> 26:09.880
 And you sleep less.

26:09.880 --> 26:11.400
 And then there's personal stuff,

26:11.400 --> 26:14.640
 like just people in your life, sources of stress,

26:14.640 --> 26:16.520
 all those kinds of things.

26:16.520 --> 26:19.960
 But it does feel like if I'm just being introspective,

26:19.960 --> 26:22.400
 that I bring it onto myself.

26:22.400 --> 26:24.480
 I suppose a lot of people do this kind of thing.

26:24.480 --> 26:25.680
 Yeah.

26:25.680 --> 26:29.720
 Is they flourish under pressure.

26:29.720 --> 26:30.560
 Yeah.

26:30.560 --> 26:34.920
 And I wonder if that's just a hack I've developed

26:34.920 --> 26:37.600
 as a habit early on in life

26:38.480 --> 26:42.080
 that you need to let go of, you need to fix.

26:42.080 --> 26:44.000
 But it's all interesting things.

26:44.000 --> 26:44.840
 Yeah.

26:44.840 --> 26:45.680
 That's interesting.

26:45.680 --> 26:47.520
 Yeah, because these are all interesting things.

26:47.520 --> 26:49.720
 Well, one of the things you talked about in Deep Work,

26:49.720 --> 26:53.480
 which is really important, is having an end to the day.

26:53.480 --> 26:54.320
 Yeah.

26:54.320 --> 26:55.160
 Like putting it down.

26:55.160 --> 26:56.000
 Yeah.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.040
 Like that, I don't think I've ever done that in my life.

26:59.040 --> 26:59.880
 Yeah.

26:59.880 --> 27:01.000
 Well, see, I started doing that early

27:01.000 --> 27:04.040
 because I got married early.

27:04.040 --> 27:05.280
 So I didn't have a real job.

27:05.280 --> 27:07.680
 I was a grad student, but my wife had a real job.

27:07.680 --> 27:10.840
 And so I just figured I should do my work

27:10.840 --> 27:12.160
 when she's at work.

27:12.160 --> 27:14.440
 Because hey, when work's over, she'll be home,

27:14.440 --> 27:17.720
 and I don't wanna be on campus or whatever.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.680
 And so real early on, I just got in that habit

27:19.680 --> 27:22.280
 of this is when you end work.

27:22.280 --> 27:24.000
 And then when I was a postdoc,

27:24.000 --> 27:26.400
 which is kind of an easy job, right?

27:26.400 --> 27:29.960
 I put artificial, I was like, I wanna train.

27:29.960 --> 27:31.560
 I was like, when I'm a professor, it's gonna be busier

27:31.560 --> 27:34.200
 because there's demands that professors have beyond research.

27:34.200 --> 27:35.560
 And so as a postdoc,

27:35.560 --> 27:37.960
 I added artificial large time consuming things

27:37.960 --> 27:38.800
 into the middle of my day.

27:38.800 --> 27:41.200
 I basically exercise for two hours in the middle of the day

27:41.200 --> 27:44.560
 and do all this productive meditation and stuff like this,

27:44.560 --> 27:46.720
 while still maintaining the nine to five.

27:46.720 --> 27:48.680
 So it's like, okay, I wanna get really good

27:48.680 --> 27:51.600
 at putting artificial constraints on so that I stay,

27:51.600 --> 27:54.720
 I didn't wanna get flabby when my job was easy.

27:54.720 --> 27:56.600
 So that when I became a professor,

27:56.600 --> 27:57.800
 and now all of that's paying off

27:57.800 --> 27:59.280
 because I have a ton of kids.

27:59.280 --> 28:01.880
 So now I don't really have a choice.

28:01.880 --> 28:04.080
 That's what's probably keeping me away from cool things

28:04.080 --> 28:06.200
 is I just don't have time to do them.

28:06.200 --> 28:09.960
 And then after a while people stop bothering.

28:09.960 --> 28:13.000
 Well, but that's how you have a successful life.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.440
 Otherwise you're going to,

28:14.440 --> 28:17.960
 it's too easy to then go into the full Hunter S. Thompson.

28:17.960 --> 28:22.040
 Like to where nobody wants,

28:22.040 --> 28:25.680
 nobody functional wants to be in your vicinity.

28:25.680 --> 28:29.200
 Like you're driving, you attract the people

28:29.200 --> 28:33.360
 that have a similar behavior pattern as you.

28:33.360 --> 28:35.400
 So if you live in chaos,

28:35.400 --> 28:37.360
 you're going to attract chaotic people.

28:37.360 --> 28:42.040
 And then it becomes like this self fulfilling prophecy.

28:42.040 --> 28:45.920
 And it feels like I'm not bothered by it,

28:45.920 --> 28:48.400
 but I guess this is all coming around

28:48.400 --> 28:50.880
 to exactly what you're saying, which is like,

28:50.880 --> 28:53.120
 I think one of the big hacks for productive people

28:53.120 --> 28:57.560
 that I've met is to get married and have kids, honestly.

28:57.560 --> 29:00.800
 It's very perhaps counterintuitive,

29:00.800 --> 29:05.600
 but it gets, it's like the ultimate timetable enforcer.

29:05.600 --> 29:08.800
 Yeah, it enforces a lot of timetables,

29:08.800 --> 29:10.200
 though it has a huge,

29:10.200 --> 29:13.280
 kids have a huge productivity hit those, you gotta weigh it.

29:13.280 --> 29:15.400
 But okay, here's the complicated thing though.

29:15.400 --> 29:17.080
 Like you could think about in your own life,

29:17.080 --> 29:18.520
 starting the podcast as one of these

29:18.520 --> 29:22.040
 just cool opportunities that you put on yourself, right?

29:22.040 --> 29:25.000
 Like I could have been talking to you at MIT four years ago

29:25.000 --> 29:25.840
 and be like, don't do that.

29:25.840 --> 29:28.080
 Like your research is going well, right?

29:28.080 --> 29:29.320
 But then everyone who watches you is like,

29:29.320 --> 29:30.480
 okay, this podcast is,

29:30.480 --> 29:31.680
 the direction that's taking you

29:31.680 --> 29:33.640
 is like a couple of years from now,

29:33.640 --> 29:36.560
 it's gonna, it'll be something really monumental

29:36.560 --> 29:38.040
 that you're probably, that's gonna probably lead to, right?

29:38.040 --> 29:39.880
 There'll be some really,

29:39.880 --> 29:41.760
 it just feels like your life is going somewhere.

29:41.760 --> 29:42.600
 It's going somewhere.

29:42.600 --> 29:43.600
 It's interesting.

29:43.600 --> 29:44.560
 Unexpected, yeah.

29:44.560 --> 29:46.320
 Yeah, so how do you balance those two things?

29:46.320 --> 29:47.840
 And so what I try to throw at it

29:47.840 --> 29:50.880
 is this motto of do less, do better, know why, right?

29:50.880 --> 29:55.560
 So do less, do better, know why.

29:55.560 --> 29:58.720
 It used to be the motto of my website years ago.

29:58.720 --> 30:01.880
 So do a few things, but like an interesting array, right?

30:01.880 --> 30:06.840
 So I was doing MIT stuff, but I was also writing, you know?

30:06.840 --> 30:08.440
 So a couple of things are, you know, they were interesting.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.200
 Like I have a couple bets placed

30:10.200 --> 30:12.760
 on a couple of different numbers on the roulette table,

30:12.760 --> 30:14.080
 but not too many things.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.840
 And then really try to do those things really well

30:15.840 --> 30:16.800
 and see where it goes.

30:16.800 --> 30:17.640
 Like with my writing,

30:17.640 --> 30:19.520
 I just spent years and years and years just training.

30:19.520 --> 30:20.360
 I was like, I wanna be a better writer,

30:20.360 --> 30:21.200
 I wanna be a better writer.

30:21.200 --> 30:24.160
 I started writing student books when I was a student.

30:24.160 --> 30:25.920
 I really wanted to write hardcover idea books.

30:25.920 --> 30:26.760
 I started training.

30:26.760 --> 30:30.280
 I would use like New Yorker articles to train myself.

30:30.280 --> 30:31.960
 I'd break them down and then I'd get commissions

30:31.960 --> 30:34.320
 with much smaller magazines and practice the skills.

30:34.320 --> 30:37.000
 And it took forever until, you know, but now today,

30:37.000 --> 30:38.320
 like I actually get to write for the New Yorker,

30:38.320 --> 30:40.280
 but it took like a decade.

30:40.280 --> 30:42.080
 So a small number of things, try to do them really well.

30:42.080 --> 30:44.040
 And then the know why is have a connection

30:44.040 --> 30:45.760
 to some sort of value.

30:45.760 --> 30:48.880
 Like in general, I think this is worth doing

30:48.880 --> 30:50.600
 and then seeing where it leads.

30:50.600 --> 30:55.280
 And so the choice of the few things is grounded in what?

30:55.280 --> 31:00.240
 Like a little flame of passion, like a love for the thing,

31:00.240 --> 31:02.560
 like a sense that you say you wanted to write,

31:02.560 --> 31:04.200
 get good at writing.

31:04.200 --> 31:07.780
 You had that kind of introspective moment of thinking,

31:07.780 --> 31:10.320
 this actually brings me a lot of joy and fulfillment.

31:10.320 --> 31:11.560
 Yeah, I mean, it gets complicated

31:11.560 --> 31:12.400
 because I wrote a whole book

31:12.400 --> 31:14.640
 about following your passion being bad advice,

31:14.640 --> 31:18.400
 which is like the first thing I kind of got infamous for.

31:18.400 --> 31:20.080
 I wrote that back in 2012.

31:20.080 --> 31:23.280
 But the argument there is like passion cultivates, right?

31:23.280 --> 31:26.120
 So what I was pushing back on was the myth

31:26.120 --> 31:29.880
 that the passion for what you do exists full intensity

31:29.880 --> 31:32.620
 before you start, and then that's what propels you.

31:32.620 --> 31:35.400
 Or actually the reality is as you get better at something,

31:35.400 --> 31:37.280
 as you gain more autonomy, more skill and more impact,

31:37.280 --> 31:38.600
 the passion grows along with it.

31:38.600 --> 31:42.060
 So that when people look back later and say,

31:42.060 --> 31:43.760
 oh, follow your passion, what they really mean is

31:43.760 --> 31:45.200
 I'm very passionate about what I do,

31:45.200 --> 31:47.080
 and that's a worthy goal.

31:47.080 --> 31:49.320
 But how you actually cultivate that is much more complicated

31:49.320 --> 31:51.960
 than just introspection is gonna identify,

31:51.960 --> 31:54.060
 like for sure you should be a writer or something like this.

31:54.060 --> 31:55.280
 So I was actually quoting you.

31:55.280 --> 32:00.280
 I was on a social network last night in a clubhouse.

32:00.400 --> 32:01.720
 I don't know if you've heard of it.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.280
 Wait, I have to ask you about this

32:03.280 --> 32:05.560
 because I'm invited to do a clubhouse.

32:05.560 --> 32:07.160
 I don't know what that means.

32:07.160 --> 32:09.300
 A tech reporter has invited me to do a clubhouse

32:09.300 --> 32:10.200
 about my new book.

32:11.200 --> 32:12.560
 That's awesome.

32:12.560 --> 32:14.200
 Well, let me know when, because I'll show up.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.080
 But what is it?

32:15.080 --> 32:16.680
 Okay, so first of all, let me just mention

32:16.680 --> 32:21.120
 that I was in a clubhouse room last night,

32:21.120 --> 32:24.760
 and I kept plugging exactly what you said about passion.

32:24.760 --> 32:25.800
 So we'll talk about it.

32:25.800 --> 32:28.360
 It was a room that was focused on burnout.

32:28.360 --> 32:29.520
 Okay.

32:29.520 --> 32:34.200
 But first, clubhouse is a kind of fascinating place

32:34.200 --> 32:37.680
 in terms of your mind would be very interesting

32:37.680 --> 32:41.640
 to analyze this place because we talk about email,

32:41.640 --> 32:43.560
 talk about social networks,

32:43.560 --> 32:45.400
 but clubhouse is something very different.

32:45.400 --> 32:47.280
 And I've encountered it in other places,

32:47.280 --> 32:52.280
 Discord and so on, that's voice only communication.

32:52.320 --> 32:53.740
 So it's a bunch of people in a room.

32:53.740 --> 32:56.240
 They're just, their eyes closed.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.640
 All you hear is their voices.

32:57.640 --> 32:58.520
 In real time.

32:58.520 --> 32:59.840
 Real time, live.

32:59.840 --> 33:01.060
 It only happens live.

33:01.060 --> 33:03.240
 You're technically not allowed to record,

33:03.240 --> 33:04.680
 but some people still do,

33:04.680 --> 33:07.740
 and especially when it's big conversations.

33:07.740 --> 33:09.840
 But the whole point is it's there live.

33:09.840 --> 33:10.960
 And there's different structures.

33:10.960 --> 33:13.920
 Like on Discord, it was so fascinating.

33:13.920 --> 33:15.960
 I have this Discord server

33:15.960 --> 33:19.480
 that would have hundreds of people in a room together, right?

33:19.480 --> 33:22.880
 We're all just little icons that can mute and unmute our mics.

33:22.880 --> 33:23.720
 Okay.

33:23.720 --> 33:28.240
 And so you're sitting there, so it's just voices,

33:28.240 --> 33:31.280
 and you're able with hundreds of people

33:31.280 --> 33:33.960
 to not interrupt each other.

33:33.960 --> 33:37.400
 Well, first of all, like as a dynamic system, like.

33:37.400 --> 33:40.160
 You see icons just like mics muted or not muted basically.

33:40.160 --> 33:42.360
 Yeah, well, so everyone's muted and they unmute

33:42.360 --> 33:44.120
 and it starts flashing.

33:44.120 --> 33:44.960
 Yeah.

33:44.960 --> 33:47.940
 Oh, so you're like, okay, let me get precedence.

33:47.940 --> 33:48.780
 Yeah.

33:48.780 --> 33:49.600
 So it's the digital equivalent

33:49.600 --> 33:52.320
 of when you're in a conversation, like at a faculty meeting,

33:52.320 --> 33:54.840
 and you sort of like kind of make some noises,

33:54.840 --> 33:56.200
 like while the other person's finishing.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.800
 And so people realize like, okay,

33:57.800 --> 33:58.880
 this person wants to talk next,

33:58.880 --> 34:00.200
 but now it's purely digital.

34:00.200 --> 34:01.480
 You see a flashing.

34:01.480 --> 34:04.280
 But in a faculty meeting, which is very interesting,

34:04.280 --> 34:06.540
 like even as we're talking now,

34:06.540 --> 34:09.600
 there's a visual element that seems to increase

34:09.600 --> 34:11.320
 the probability of interruption.

34:11.320 --> 34:12.160
 Yeah.

34:12.160 --> 34:13.680
 It's just darkness.

34:13.680 --> 34:17.280
 You actually listen better and you don't interrupt.

34:17.280 --> 34:18.720
 So like if you create a culture,

34:18.720 --> 34:20.840
 there's always gonna be assholes,

34:20.840 --> 34:23.320
 but they're actually exceptions.

34:23.320 --> 34:24.640
 Everybody adjusts.

34:24.640 --> 34:28.240
 They kind of evolve to the beat of the room.

34:28.240 --> 34:30.280
 Okay, that's one fascinating aspect.

34:30.280 --> 34:32.200
 It's like, okay, that's weird.

34:32.200 --> 34:34.360
 Cause it's different than like a Zoom call

34:34.360 --> 34:35.520
 where there's video.

34:35.520 --> 34:36.760
 Yeah.

34:36.760 --> 34:38.520
 It's just audio.

34:38.520 --> 34:42.680
 You think video adds, but actually seems like it subtracts.

34:42.680 --> 34:45.160
 The second aspect of it that's fascinating

34:45.160 --> 34:49.920
 is when it's no video, just audio, there's an intimacy.

34:49.920 --> 34:51.640
 It's weird.

34:51.640 --> 34:56.640
 Because with strangers, you connect in a much more real way.

34:57.160 --> 34:58.960
 It's similar to podcasts.

34:58.960 --> 34:59.800
 Yeah.

34:59.800 --> 35:01.600
 But with a lot of people.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.880
 With a lot of people and new people.

35:03.880 --> 35:07.520
 And they bring, okay, first of all,

35:07.520 --> 35:10.840
 different voices, like low voices and like high voices.

35:10.840 --> 35:14.320
 And it's more difficult to judge.

35:14.320 --> 35:18.520
 In Discord, you couldn't even see the people.

35:18.520 --> 35:21.600
 It was a culture where you do funny profile pictures

35:21.600 --> 35:23.120
 as opposed to your actual face.

35:23.120 --> 35:24.920
 In clubhouse, it's your actual face.

35:24.920 --> 35:27.600
 So you can tell like as an older person, younger person.

35:27.600 --> 35:28.800
 In Discord, you couldn't.

35:28.800 --> 35:31.240
 You just have to judge based on the voice.

35:31.240 --> 35:34.960
 But there's something about the listening

35:34.960 --> 35:37.920
 and the intimacy of being surprised

35:37.920 --> 35:40.080
 by different strangers that feels almost

35:40.080 --> 35:43.560
 like a party with friends.

35:43.560 --> 35:45.320
 And friends of friends you haven't met yet,

35:45.320 --> 35:47.280
 but you really like.

35:47.280 --> 35:49.680
 Now clubhouse also has an interesting innovation

35:49.680 --> 35:52.280
 where there's a large crowd that just listens

35:52.280 --> 35:54.120
 and there's a stage.

35:54.120 --> 35:56.320
 And you can bring people up onto stage.

35:56.320 --> 35:59.200
 So only people on stage are talking.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.320
 And you can have like five, six, seven, eight,

36:01.320 --> 36:03.320
 sometimes 20, 30 people on stage.

36:03.320 --> 36:05.200
 And then you can also have thousands of people

36:05.200 --> 36:06.040
 just listening.

36:06.040 --> 36:06.880
 I see.

36:06.880 --> 36:08.880
 So there's a, I don't know,

36:08.880 --> 36:10.760
 a lot of people are being surprised by this.

36:10.760 --> 36:12.280
 Why is it called a social network?

36:12.280 --> 36:14.200
 It seems like it doesn't have, there's not social links.

36:14.200 --> 36:17.200
 There's not a feed that's trying to harvest attention.

36:17.200 --> 36:19.160
 It feels like a communication.

36:20.160 --> 36:24.160
 So the social network aspect is you follow people.

36:24.160 --> 36:26.160
 And the people you follow,

36:26.160 --> 36:27.600
 now this is like the first social network

36:27.600 --> 36:30.440
 that is actually correct use of follow, I think.

36:30.440 --> 36:35.080
 You're more likely to see the rooms they're in.

36:35.080 --> 36:37.200
 So there's a, your feed is a bunch of rooms

36:37.200 --> 36:39.120
 that are going on right now.

36:39.120 --> 36:43.360
 And the people you follow are the ones

36:43.360 --> 36:44.800
 that will increase the likelihood

36:44.800 --> 36:46.360
 that you'll see the room they're in.

36:46.360 --> 36:48.480
 And so the final result is like,

36:48.480 --> 36:50.320
 there's a list of really interesting rooms.

36:50.320 --> 36:53.800
 Like I have all these, I've been speaking Russian

36:53.800 --> 36:55.880
 quite a bit, there's practicing,

36:55.880 --> 36:58.200
 but also just like talking politics

36:58.200 --> 37:00.080
 and philosophy in Russian.

37:00.080 --> 37:01.160
 I've never done that before,

37:01.160 --> 37:03.320
 but it allows me to connect with that community.

37:03.320 --> 37:05.640
 And then there's a community of people,

37:05.640 --> 37:09.160
 like it's funny, but like I'll go in a community

37:09.160 --> 37:12.160
 of all African American people talking about race

37:12.160 --> 37:13.920
 and I'll be welcomed.

37:13.920 --> 37:17.040
 I've never had, like I've literally never been

37:17.040 --> 37:20.200
 in a difficult conversation about race,

37:20.200 --> 37:22.520
 like with people from all over the place.

37:22.520 --> 37:23.440
 It's like fascinating.

37:23.440 --> 37:26.400
 And then musicians, jazz musicians, I don't know.

37:26.400 --> 37:28.400
 You could say that a lot of other places

37:28.400 --> 37:31.280
 could have created that culture, I suppose.

37:31.280 --> 37:32.960
 Twitter and Facebook a lot for that culture,

37:32.960 --> 37:35.880
 but there's something about this network

37:35.880 --> 37:39.200
 as it stands now, cause no Android users.

37:40.480 --> 37:42.720
 It's probably just because it's iPhone people.

37:43.800 --> 37:44.640
 It's like.

37:44.640 --> 37:45.480
 Less conspiratorial or something.

37:45.480 --> 37:47.320
 Well, like less, listen, I'm an Android person.

37:47.320 --> 37:50.120
 So I got an iPhone just for this network, which is funny.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.920
 For now it's all like, there's very few trolls.

37:55.920 --> 37:57.240
 There's very few people that are trying

37:57.240 --> 37:59.240
 to manipulate the system and so on.

37:59.240 --> 38:00.920
 So I don't know, it's interesting.

38:00.920 --> 38:03.600
 Now the downside, the reason you're going to hate it

38:04.760 --> 38:08.520
 is because it's so intimate, because it pulls you in

38:08.520 --> 38:11.320
 and pulls in very successful people like you,

38:11.320 --> 38:15.960
 just like really successful, productive, very busy people.

38:20.040 --> 38:21.360
 It's a huge time sink.

38:21.360 --> 38:23.640
 It's very difficult to pull yourself out.

38:23.640 --> 38:25.080
 Interesting, you mean once you're in a room?

38:25.080 --> 38:27.760
 Well, no, leaving the room is actually easy.

38:27.760 --> 38:30.480
 The beautiful thing about a stage with multiple people,

38:30.480 --> 38:33.600
 there's a little button that says leave quietly.

38:33.600 --> 38:38.520
 So culture, no etiquette wise, it's okay to just leave.

38:38.520 --> 38:41.000
 So you and I in a room, when it's just you and I,

38:41.000 --> 38:42.200
 it's a little awkward to leave.

38:42.200 --> 38:44.240
 If you're asking questions, I'm just gone.

38:44.240 --> 38:47.760
 But, and actually if you're being interviewed for the book,

38:47.760 --> 38:51.040
 that's weird because you're now in the event

38:51.040 --> 38:54.000
 and you're supposed to, but usually the person interviewing

38:54.000 --> 38:55.920
 would be like, okay, it's time for you to go.

38:55.920 --> 38:59.960
 It's more normal, but the normal way to use the room

38:59.960 --> 39:02.840
 was like, you're just opening the app

39:02.840 --> 39:05.480
 and there'll be like, I don't know, Sam Harris,

39:06.840 --> 39:11.840
 Eric Weinstein, I think Joe Rogan showed up to the app,

39:12.040 --> 39:13.960
 Bill Gates, these people on stage

39:13.960 --> 39:15.840
 just like randomly just plugged in

39:15.840 --> 39:18.000
 and then you'll step up on stage,

39:18.000 --> 39:20.360
 listen, maybe you won't contribute at all,

39:20.360 --> 39:22.000
 maybe you'll say something funny

39:22.000 --> 39:23.400
 and then you'll just leave.

39:23.400 --> 39:26.880
 And there's the addicting aspect to it.

39:26.880 --> 39:30.040
 The reason it's a time sink is you don't wanna leave.

39:30.040 --> 39:33.440
 What I've noticed about exceptionally busy people

39:33.440 --> 39:35.600
 that they love this.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.280
 I think it might have to do with the pandemic.

39:37.280 --> 39:38.240
 It might be a little bit, yeah.

39:38.240 --> 39:39.240
 There's a loneliness.

39:39.240 --> 39:40.560
 They're all starved, yeah.

39:40.560 --> 39:42.480
 But also it's really cool people.

39:42.480 --> 39:43.320
 Yeah.

39:43.320 --> 39:46.040
 Like when was the last time you talked to Sam Harris

39:46.040 --> 39:48.760
 or whoever, like think of anybody,

39:48.760 --> 39:52.120
 Tyler Copeland, like any faculty.

39:52.120 --> 39:54.840
 This is like what universities strive to create,

39:54.840 --> 39:57.680
 but it's taken hundreds of years of cultural evolution

39:57.680 --> 39:59.640
 to try to get a lot of interesting, smart people together

39:59.640 --> 40:00.640
 that run into each other.

40:00.640 --> 40:04.600
 We have really strong faculty in a room together

40:04.600 --> 40:05.760
 with no scheduling.

40:05.760 --> 40:07.160
 This is the power of it.

40:07.160 --> 40:08.760
 It's like you just show up,

40:08.760 --> 40:11.320
 there's none of that baggage of scheduling and so on

40:11.320 --> 40:13.880
 and there's no pressure to leave, sorry,

40:13.880 --> 40:15.080
 no pressure to stay.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.680
 It's very easy for you to leave.

40:16.680 --> 40:19.240
 You realize that there's a lot of constraints on meetings

40:19.240 --> 40:24.240
 and like faculty, like even stopping by before the pandemic,

40:25.520 --> 40:28.400
 a friend or faculty or colleague and so on,

40:28.400 --> 40:30.040
 there's a weirdness about leaving.

40:30.040 --> 40:31.040
 Yeah.

40:31.040 --> 40:33.240
 But here there's not a weirdness about leaving.

40:33.240 --> 40:36.040
 So they've discovered something interesting.

40:36.040 --> 40:38.800
 But the final result when you observe it

40:38.800 --> 40:41.080
 is it's very fulfilling.

40:41.080 --> 40:44.840
 I think it's very beneficial, but it's very addicting.

40:44.840 --> 40:48.520
 So you have to make sure you moderate.

40:48.520 --> 40:50.160
 Yeah, that's interesting.

40:50.160 --> 40:52.160
 Okay, well, so maybe I'll try it.

40:52.160 --> 40:53.520
 I mean, look, there's no,

40:53.520 --> 40:54.720
 the things that make me suspicious

40:54.720 --> 40:56.640
 about other platforms aren't here.

40:56.640 --> 41:00.480
 So the feed is not full of user generated content

41:00.480 --> 41:02.800
 that is going through some sort of algorithmic rating process

41:02.800 --> 41:05.760
 with all the weird incentives and nudging that does.

41:05.760 --> 41:08.840
 And you're not producing content that's being harvested

41:08.840 --> 41:11.240
 to be monetized by another company.

41:11.240 --> 41:14.360
 I mean, it seems like it's more ephemeral, right?

41:14.360 --> 41:15.760
 You're here, you're talking.

41:15.760 --> 41:17.880
 The feed is just actually just showing you

41:17.880 --> 41:19.320
 here's interesting things happening, right?

41:19.320 --> 41:21.040
 You're not jockeying in the feed for,

41:21.040 --> 41:22.400
 look, I'm being clever or something

41:22.400 --> 41:24.640
 and I'm gonna get a light count that goes up

41:24.640 --> 41:26.640
 and that's gonna influence.

41:26.640 --> 41:27.520
 And there's more friction.

41:27.520 --> 41:28.960
 There's more cognitive friction, I guess,

41:28.960 --> 41:31.360
 involved in listening to smart people

41:31.360 --> 41:33.480
 versus scrolling through.

41:33.480 --> 41:34.440
 Yeah, there's something there.

41:34.440 --> 41:35.320
 So there's no.

41:35.320 --> 41:37.160
 Why are people so, I see all,

41:37.160 --> 41:39.200
 there's all these articles that seem,

41:39.200 --> 41:40.360
 I haven't really read them.

41:40.360 --> 41:42.320
 Why are reporters negative about this?

41:42.320 --> 41:43.240
 Competition.

41:43.240 --> 41:44.880
 The New York Times wrote this article called

41:44.880 --> 41:49.120
 Unfettered Conversations Happening on Clubhouse is.

41:49.120 --> 41:51.080
 So I'm right in picking up a tone

41:51.080 --> 41:51.920
 even from the headlines

41:51.920 --> 41:55.000
 that there's some like negative vibes from the press.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.400
 No, so I can say, let's say,

41:58.400 --> 42:00.880
 well, I'll tell you what the article was saying,

42:00.880 --> 42:05.680
 which is they're having cancellable conversations,

42:05.680 --> 42:07.240
 like the biggest people in the world

42:07.240 --> 42:08.920
 almost trolling the press.

42:08.920 --> 42:09.760
 Right.

42:09.760 --> 42:10.600
 And the press is desperately.

42:10.600 --> 42:11.440
 Like foreshanning the press.

42:11.440 --> 42:13.120
 Yeah, foreshanning the press.

42:13.120 --> 42:16.680
 By saying that you guys are looking for click bait

42:16.680 --> 42:19.200
 from our genuine human conversations.

42:19.200 --> 42:23.000
 And so I think the, honestly,

42:23.000 --> 42:25.400
 the press is just like, what do we do with this?

42:25.400 --> 42:28.880
 We can't, first of all, it's a lot of work for them.

42:28.880 --> 42:29.920
 Okay.

42:29.920 --> 42:32.320
 It's what Naval says, which is like,

42:32.320 --> 42:34.520
 this is skipping the journalist.

42:34.520 --> 42:37.080
 Like the interview you, if you go on Clubhouse,

42:37.080 --> 42:39.640
 the interview you might do for the book

42:39.640 --> 42:41.360
 will be with somebody who's like a journalist

42:41.360 --> 42:42.320
 and interviewing you.

42:42.320 --> 42:43.160
 Yeah.

42:43.160 --> 42:44.760
 That's more traditional.

42:44.760 --> 42:45.600
 Yeah.

42:45.600 --> 42:47.200
 It'd be a good introduction for you to try it.

42:47.200 --> 42:52.200
 But like the way to use Clubhouse is you just show up

42:52.960 --> 42:55.560
 and it's like, again, like me, I'm sorry,

42:55.560 --> 42:58.880
 I'm like, boy, I keep mentioning Sam Harris

42:58.880 --> 43:00.480
 as if it's like the only person I know,

43:00.480 --> 43:03.600
 but like a lot of these major faculty,

43:03.600 --> 43:04.840
 I don't know, Max Tegmark.

43:04.840 --> 43:07.360
 Like just major faculty just sitting there

43:07.360 --> 43:10.840
 and then you show up and then I'll ask like,

43:10.840 --> 43:12.680
 oh, don't you have a book coming out or something?

43:12.680 --> 43:14.360
 And then you'll talk about the book

43:14.360 --> 43:15.640
 and then you'll leave five minutes later

43:15.640 --> 43:17.360
 because you have to go get coffee included.

43:17.360 --> 43:18.200
 Interesting.

43:18.200 --> 43:20.920
 So like that's the, it's not the journalistic,

43:20.920 --> 43:23.840
 you're not gonna actually enjoy the interview as much

43:23.840 --> 43:26.120
 because it'll be like the normal thing.

43:26.120 --> 43:26.960
 Yeah.

43:26.960 --> 43:28.800
 Like you're there 40 minutes or an hour

43:28.800 --> 43:30.560
 and there'll be questions from the audience.

43:30.560 --> 43:31.400
 Right.

43:31.400 --> 43:33.720
 Like I'm doing an event next week for the book launch

43:33.720 --> 43:37.360
 where it's like Jason Fried and I are talking about email,

43:37.360 --> 43:40.120
 but it's using some more like a thousand people

43:40.120 --> 43:41.560
 who are there to watch virtually,

43:41.560 --> 43:44.720
 but it's using some sort of traditional webinar.

43:44.720 --> 43:46.000
 Clubhouse would be a situation

43:46.000 --> 43:47.560
 where that could just happen informally.

43:47.560 --> 43:49.000
 Like I jump in like Jason's there

43:49.000 --> 43:51.920
 and then someone else jumps in and yeah, that's interesting.

43:51.920 --> 43:53.920
 But for now it's still closed.

43:53.920 --> 43:56.160
 So even though there's a lot of excitement

43:56.160 --> 43:58.920
 and there'll be quite famous people

43:58.920 --> 44:00.320
 just sitting there listening to you.

44:00.320 --> 44:01.800
 Yeah.

44:01.800 --> 44:04.280
 But the numbers aren't exactly high.

44:04.280 --> 44:05.920
 So you're talking about rooms,

44:05.920 --> 44:09.320
 like even the huge rooms are like just a few thousand.

44:09.320 --> 44:10.160
 Right.

44:10.160 --> 44:12.600
 And this is probably like Soho in the 50s or something too.

44:12.600 --> 44:15.400
 Just because of the exponential growth,

44:15.400 --> 44:17.080
 give it seven more months.

44:17.080 --> 44:19.440
 And if you let one invite be, it gets two invites,

44:19.440 --> 44:20.280
 it gets four invites,

44:20.280 --> 44:22.120
 because pretty soon it'll be everyone.

44:22.120 --> 44:25.360
 And then the rooms in your feed are gonna be whatever,

44:25.360 --> 44:27.760
 marketing, performance enhancing drugs or something like that.

44:27.760 --> 44:28.600
 Exactly.

44:28.600 --> 44:29.440
 Yeah.

44:29.440 --> 44:30.560
 But then in a bunch of competitors,

44:30.560 --> 44:33.240
 there's already like 30 plus competitors sprung up,

44:33.240 --> 44:34.360
 Twitter spaces.

44:34.360 --> 44:36.160
 So Twitter is creating a competitor

44:36.160 --> 44:38.520
 that's going to likely destroy Clubhouse

44:38.520 --> 44:40.480
 because they just have a much larger user base

44:40.480 --> 44:42.400
 and they already have a social network.

44:42.400 --> 44:46.400
 So I would be very cautious, of course,

44:46.400 --> 44:47.560
 with the addictive element,

44:47.560 --> 44:49.280
 but it doesn't just like you said,

44:49.280 --> 44:52.080
 this particular implementation in its early stages

44:52.080 --> 44:53.320
 doesn't have the like,

44:56.040 --> 44:58.000
 it doesn't have the context switching problem.

44:58.000 --> 44:58.840
 Yeah.

44:58.840 --> 45:01.120
 You'll just switch to it and you'll be stuck.

45:01.120 --> 45:02.840
 Yeah, to keep a context is great.

45:02.840 --> 45:04.360
 Yeah. Yeah.

45:04.360 --> 45:07.640
 But then I think the best way I've found to use it

45:07.640 --> 45:12.640
 is to acknowledge that these things pull you in.

45:12.920 --> 45:13.760
 Yeah.

45:13.760 --> 45:17.000
 So I've used it in the past,

45:17.000 --> 45:19.120
 like almost, I'll go get a coffee

45:19.120 --> 45:20.880
 and I'll tune into a conversation

45:22.040 --> 45:24.360
 as if that's how I use podcasts sometimes.

45:24.360 --> 45:26.920
 I'll just like play a little bit of a podcast

45:26.920 --> 45:29.600
 and then I can just turn it off.

45:29.600 --> 45:31.880
 The problem with these is it pulls you in,

45:31.880 --> 45:32.800
 it's really interesting.

45:32.800 --> 45:35.400
 And then the other problem that you'll experience

45:35.400 --> 45:38.000
 is like somebody will recognize you.

45:38.000 --> 45:38.840
 Yeah.

45:38.840 --> 45:40.400
 And then they'll be like, oh, Lex.

45:40.400 --> 45:41.320
 Come on up.

45:41.320 --> 45:42.160
 Come on.

45:42.160 --> 45:43.440
 Oh, hey, I had a question for you.

45:43.440 --> 45:46.600
 And then it takes a lot for you to go like,

45:46.600 --> 45:47.600
 to ignore that.

45:47.600 --> 45:48.520
 Yeah. Yeah.

45:48.520 --> 45:49.360
 So. Yeah.

45:49.360 --> 45:51.080
 And then you pulled in and it's fascinating

45:51.080 --> 45:52.280
 and it's really cool people.

45:52.280 --> 45:53.840
 So it's like a source of a lot of joy,

45:53.840 --> 45:58.120
 but you have to be very, very careful.

45:58.120 --> 46:00.160
 The reason I brought it up is we,

46:00.160 --> 46:04.120
 there's a room, there's an entire club actually on burnout.

46:04.120 --> 46:08.120
 And I brought you up and I brought David Goggins

46:08.120 --> 46:10.960
 as the process I go through, which is,

46:10.960 --> 46:14.920
 my passion goes up and down, it dips.

46:14.920 --> 46:17.920
 And I don't think I trust my own mind

46:17.920 --> 46:22.600
 to tell me whether I'm getting close to burnout

46:22.600 --> 46:24.800
 or exhaustion or not.

46:24.800 --> 46:28.280
 I kind of go with the David Goggins model of,

46:28.280 --> 46:30.240
 I mean, he's probably more applying it to running,

46:30.240 --> 46:35.120
 but when it feels like your mind can't take any more,

46:35.120 --> 46:38.920
 that you're just 40% at your capacity.

46:38.920 --> 46:41.040
 I mean, it's just like an arbitrary level.

46:41.040 --> 46:41.880
 It's the Navy SEAL thing, right?

46:41.880 --> 46:43.040
 The Navy SEAL thing.

46:43.040 --> 46:44.600
 I mean, you could put that at any percent,

46:44.600 --> 46:48.080
 but it is remarkable that if you just take it

46:48.080 --> 46:49.960
 one step at a time, just keep going,

46:49.960 --> 46:53.360
 it's similar to this idea of a process.

46:53.360 --> 46:55.840
 If you just trust the process and you just keep following,

46:55.840 --> 46:58.400
 even if the passion goes up and down and so on,

46:58.400 --> 47:02.720
 then ultimately, if you look in aggregate,

47:02.720 --> 47:04.400
 the passion will increase.

47:04.400 --> 47:06.560
 Your self satisfaction will increase.

47:06.560 --> 47:08.280
 And if you have two things,

47:08.280 --> 47:09.760
 this has been a big strategy of mine,

47:09.760 --> 47:14.200
 so that what you hope for is off phase, off phase alignment.

47:14.200 --> 47:16.520
 Sometimes it's in phase and that's a problem,

47:16.520 --> 47:18.040
 but off phase alignment's good.

47:18.040 --> 47:20.680
 So, okay, my research, I'm struggling,

47:20.680 --> 47:22.680
 but my book stuff is going well, right?

47:22.680 --> 47:24.760
 And so when you add those two waves together,

47:24.760 --> 47:25.720
 like, oh, we're doing pretty well.

47:25.720 --> 47:28.400
 And then in other periods, like on my writing,

47:28.400 --> 47:29.880
 I feel like I'm just not getting anywhere,

47:29.880 --> 47:32.360
 but I've had some good papers, I'm feeling good over there.

47:32.360 --> 47:35.960
 So having two things that can counteract each other.

47:35.960 --> 47:38.640
 Now, sometimes they fall into sync and then it gets rough.

47:38.640 --> 47:40.240
 Then when, you know, when everything,

47:40.240 --> 47:41.720
 because everything for me is cyclical,

47:41.720 --> 47:43.240
 good periods, bad periods with all this stuff.

47:43.240 --> 47:47.560
 So typically they don't coincide, so it helps compensate.

47:47.560 --> 47:50.360
 When they do coincide, you get really high highs,

47:50.360 --> 47:51.200
 like where everything's clicking,

47:51.200 --> 47:52.760
 and then you get these really low lows

47:52.760 --> 47:54.680
 where like your research is not working,

47:54.680 --> 47:56.360
 your program's not clicking,

47:56.360 --> 47:59.280
 you feel like you're nowhere with your writing,

47:59.280 --> 48:00.680
 and then it's a little rougher.

48:00.680 --> 48:04.000
 Is, do you think about the concept of burnout?

48:04.000 --> 48:06.360
 Because I personally have never experienced burnout

48:06.360 --> 48:08.240
 in the way that folks talk about,

48:08.240 --> 48:11.680
 which is like, it's not just the up and down.

48:11.680 --> 48:14.720
 It's like, you don't want to do anything ever again.

48:14.720 --> 48:15.560
 Yeah.

48:15.560 --> 48:17.640
 It's like, for some people it's like physical,

48:17.640 --> 48:19.680
 like to the hospital kind of thing.

48:19.680 --> 48:22.800
 Yeah, so I do worry about it.

48:22.800 --> 48:24.760
 So when I used to do student writing,

48:24.760 --> 48:27.360
 like writing about students and student advice,

48:27.360 --> 48:30.360
 it came up a lot with students at elite schools,

48:30.360 --> 48:32.360
 and I used to call it deep procrastination,

48:32.360 --> 48:37.360
 but it was a real, really vivid, very replicatable syndrome

48:37.600 --> 48:39.600
 where they stop being able to do schoolwork.

48:39.600 --> 48:40.440
 Yeah.

48:40.440 --> 48:42.920
 Like this is due, and the professor gives you an extension,

48:42.920 --> 48:44.280
 and the professor gives you an incomplete,

48:44.280 --> 48:46.120
 and says, you got it, you were gonna fail the course,

48:46.120 --> 48:48.680
 you have to hand this in, and they can't do it, right?

48:48.680 --> 48:50.600
 It's like a complete stop

48:50.600 --> 48:52.400
 on the ability to actually do work.

48:52.400 --> 48:54.120
 And so I used to counsel students who had that issue,

48:54.120 --> 48:56.480
 and often it was a combination of,

48:56.480 --> 48:58.680
 this is my best analysis,

48:58.680 --> 49:01.360
 is you have just the physical and cognitive difficulties

49:01.360 --> 49:03.680
 of they're usually under a very hard load, right?

49:03.680 --> 49:05.520
 They're doing too many majors, too many extracurriculars,

49:05.520 --> 49:07.480
 just really pushing themselves,

49:07.480 --> 49:11.440
 and the motivation is not sufficiently intrinsic.

49:11.440 --> 49:12.280
 Right.

49:12.280 --> 49:13.320
 So if you have a motivational center

49:13.320 --> 49:14.440
 that's not completely on board,

49:14.440 --> 49:16.720
 so a lot of these kids, like when I'm dealing with MIT kids,

49:16.720 --> 49:20.200
 they would be, their whole town was shooting off fireworks

49:20.200 --> 49:21.040
 that they got in.

49:21.040 --> 49:23.480
 Everyone's hoped that they were going there,

49:23.480 --> 49:24.640
 and that they're in three majors,

49:24.640 --> 49:25.640
 they don't wanna let people down,

49:25.640 --> 49:26.560
 but they're not really interested

49:26.560 --> 49:28.200
 in being a doctor or whatever.

49:28.200 --> 49:30.080
 So your motivation's not in the right place.

49:30.080 --> 49:31.600
 The motivational psychologist would say

49:31.600 --> 49:33.160
 the locus of control was more towards

49:33.160 --> 49:36.640
 the extrinsic end of the spectrum, and you have hardship.

49:36.640 --> 49:38.840
 And you could just fritz out the whole system.

49:38.840 --> 49:40.560
 And so I would always be very worried about that.

49:40.560 --> 49:41.880
 So I think about that a lot.

49:41.880 --> 49:45.400
 I do a lot of multi phase or multi scale seasonality.

49:45.400 --> 49:48.160
 So I'll go hard on something for a while,

49:48.160 --> 49:50.320
 and then for a few weeks, go easy.

49:50.320 --> 49:51.960
 I'll have semesters that are hard,

49:51.960 --> 49:53.120
 and semesters that are easy.

49:53.120 --> 49:54.160
 Or I'll take the summer really low.

49:54.160 --> 49:55.200
 So on multiple scales,

49:55.200 --> 49:56.680
 and in the day I'll go really hard on something,

49:56.680 --> 49:57.920
 but then have a hard cut off at five.

49:57.920 --> 50:01.920
 So like every scale, it's all about rest and recovery.

50:01.920 --> 50:02.960
 Because I really wanna avoid that.

50:02.960 --> 50:03.800
 And I do burn out.

50:03.800 --> 50:06.600
 I burnt out, pretty recently I get minor burnt outs.

50:06.600 --> 50:10.080
 I got a couple papers that I was trying to work through

50:10.080 --> 50:12.760
 for a deadline a few weeks ago,

50:12.760 --> 50:14.680
 and I wasn't sleeping well,

50:14.680 --> 50:17.520
 and there's some other things going on.

50:17.520 --> 50:20.320
 And it just knocks out and I get sick usually,

50:20.320 --> 50:22.400
 is how I know I've pushed myself too far.

50:22.400 --> 50:23.440
 And so I kind of pulled it back.

50:23.440 --> 50:24.440
 Now I'm doing this book launch.

50:24.440 --> 50:26.700
 Then after this book launch, I'm pulling it back again.

50:26.700 --> 50:29.040
 So I like seasonality for rest and recovery,

50:29.040 --> 50:30.160
 I think it's crucial.

50:30.160 --> 50:33.720
 And at every scale, daily, monthly,

50:33.720 --> 50:34.920
 and then at the annual scale.

50:34.920 --> 50:36.280
 An easy summer, for example,

50:36.280 --> 50:38.900
 I think is like a great idea if that's possible.

50:38.900 --> 50:41.260
 Okay, you just made me realize

50:41.260 --> 50:43.280
 that that's exactly what I do.

50:43.280 --> 50:45.160
 Because I feel like I'm not even close

50:45.160 --> 50:46.120
 to burnout or anything.

50:46.120 --> 50:48.800
 Even though I'm in chaos,

50:49.660 --> 50:52.440
 I feel the right exact way is the seasonality,

50:52.440 --> 50:55.200
 is the, not even the seasonality,

50:55.200 --> 50:59.020
 but like you always have multiple seasons operating.

50:59.020 --> 51:00.120
 It's like you said,

51:00.120 --> 51:02.840
 because when you have a lot of cool shit going on,

51:02.840 --> 51:06.320
 there's always at least one thing that's a source of joy,

51:06.320 --> 51:08.740
 that there's always a reason.

51:08.740 --> 51:10.900
 I suppose the fundamental thing,

51:10.900 --> 51:13.800
 and I've known people that suffer from depression too,

51:13.800 --> 51:16.760
 the fundamental problem with the experience of depression

51:16.760 --> 51:21.760
 and burnout is why do, life is meaningless.

51:21.840 --> 51:26.840
 And I always have an answer of why today could be cool.

51:28.160 --> 51:29.920
 And you have to contrive it, right?

51:29.920 --> 51:31.720
 If you don't have it, you have to contrive it.

51:31.720 --> 51:33.140
 I think it's really important.

51:33.140 --> 51:34.800
 Like, okay, well, this is going bad,

51:34.800 --> 51:37.240
 so now is the time to start thinking about,

51:37.240 --> 51:39.840
 I mean, look, I started a podcast during the pandemic.

51:39.840 --> 51:43.060
 It's like, this is going pretty bad, but you know what?

51:43.060 --> 51:46.320
 This could be something really interesting.

51:46.320 --> 51:48.040
 Deep questions with Kyle Newport.

51:49.140 --> 51:50.480
 I do it all in that voice.

51:50.480 --> 51:53.460
 I love the podcast, by the way.

51:53.460 --> 51:56.780
 But yeah, I think David Foster Wallace said,

51:56.780 --> 51:59.120
 the key to life is to be unboreable.

51:59.120 --> 52:01.800
 I've always kind of taken that to heart,

52:01.800 --> 52:05.840
 which is like, you should be able to maybe artificially

52:05.840 --> 52:08.680
 generate anything.

52:08.680 --> 52:13.680
 Like, find something in your environment,

52:13.960 --> 52:16.080
 in your surroundings, that's a source of joy.

52:16.080 --> 52:17.400
 Like, everything is fun.

52:17.400 --> 52:18.520
 Yeah.

52:18.520 --> 52:20.120
 Did you read The Pale King?

52:20.120 --> 52:21.540
 It goes deep on boredom.

52:21.540 --> 52:22.980
 It's like uncomfortable.

52:22.980 --> 52:25.660
 It's like an uncomfortable meditation on boredom.

52:25.660 --> 52:27.680
 Like, the characters in that are just driven

52:27.680 --> 52:31.660
 to the extremes of, I just bought three books on boredom

52:31.660 --> 52:35.160
 the other day, so now I'm really interested in this topic.

52:35.160 --> 52:37.200
 Because I was anxious about my book launch

52:37.200 --> 52:38.040
 happening this week.

52:38.040 --> 52:39.600
 So I was like, okay, I need something else.

52:39.600 --> 52:42.560
 So I have this idea for, I might do it as an article first,

52:42.560 --> 52:43.600
 but as a book.

52:43.600 --> 52:46.800
 Like, okay, I need something cool to be thinking about.

52:46.800 --> 52:48.160
 Because I was worried about, like,

52:48.160 --> 52:50.440
 I don't know if the launch's gonna work, the pandemic,

52:50.440 --> 52:52.160
 what's gonna happen, I don't know if it's gonna get there.

52:52.160 --> 52:54.160
 So this is exactly what we're talking about.

52:54.160 --> 52:56.040
 So I went out and I bought a bunch of books,

52:56.040 --> 53:00.240
 and I'm beginning like a whole intellectual exploration.

53:00.240 --> 53:03.040
 Well, I think that's one of the profound ideas

53:03.040 --> 53:06.480
 in deep work that you don't expand on too much

53:06.480 --> 53:08.440
 is boredom.

53:08.440 --> 53:12.600
 Yeah, well, so deep work had a superficial idea

53:12.600 --> 53:13.880
 about boredom, which was,

53:13.880 --> 53:16.160
 I had this chapter called Embrace Boredom,

53:16.160 --> 53:19.800
 and a very functionalist idea was basically,

53:19.800 --> 53:21.800
 you have to have some boredom in your regular schedule,

53:21.800 --> 53:25.040
 or your mind is gonna form a Pavlovian connection

53:25.040 --> 53:28.520
 between as soon as I feel boredom, I get stimuli.

53:28.520 --> 53:29.680
 And once it forms that connection,

53:29.680 --> 53:30.880
 it's never gonna tolerate deep work.

53:30.880 --> 53:34.320
 So there's this very pragmatic treatment of boredom

53:34.320 --> 53:36.720
 of your mind better be used to the idea

53:36.720 --> 53:37.920
 that sometimes you don't get stimuli

53:37.920 --> 53:39.800
 because otherwise you can't write for three hours,

53:39.800 --> 53:41.840
 like it's just not gonna tolerate it.

53:41.840 --> 53:44.120
 But more recently, what I'm really interested in boredom

53:44.120 --> 53:47.240
 is it as a fundamental human drive, right?

53:47.240 --> 53:49.760
 Because it's incredibly uncomfortable.

53:49.760 --> 53:51.000
 And think about the other things

53:51.000 --> 53:53.280
 that are incredibly uncomfortable, like hunger or thirst,

53:53.280 --> 53:56.680
 they serve a really important purpose for a species, right?

53:56.680 --> 53:58.760
 Like if something is really distressing, there's a reason.

53:58.760 --> 54:00.000
 Pain is really uncomfortable

54:00.000 --> 54:02.440
 because we need to worry about getting injured.

54:02.440 --> 54:03.680
 Thirst is really uncomfortable

54:03.680 --> 54:05.560
 because we need water to survive.

54:05.560 --> 54:07.000
 So what's boredom?

54:07.000 --> 54:08.680
 Why is that uncomfortable?

54:08.680 --> 54:11.480
 And I've been interested in this notion

54:11.480 --> 54:16.480
 that boredom is about driving us towards productive action.

54:17.360 --> 54:19.200
 Like as a species, I mean, think about it,

54:19.200 --> 54:22.320
 like what got us to actually take advantage of these brains?

54:22.320 --> 54:24.400
 What got us to actually work with fire?

54:24.400 --> 54:27.680
 What got us to start shaping stones and the hand axes

54:27.680 --> 54:29.680
 and figuring out if we could actually sharpen a stick

54:29.680 --> 54:32.320
 sharp enough that we could throw it as a melee weapon

54:32.320 --> 54:35.240
 or a distance weapon for hunting mammoth, right?

54:35.240 --> 54:37.920
 Boredom drives us towards action.

54:37.920 --> 54:41.440
 So now I'm fascinated by this fundamental action instinct

54:41.440 --> 54:43.520
 because I have this theory that I'm working on

54:43.520 --> 54:45.760
 that we're out of sync with it.

54:45.760 --> 54:47.880
 Just like we have this drive for hunger,

54:47.880 --> 54:49.040
 but then we introduced junk food

54:49.040 --> 54:50.280
 and got out of sync with hunger

54:50.280 --> 54:52.040
 and it makes us really unhealthy.

54:52.040 --> 54:53.400
 We have this drive towards action,

54:53.400 --> 54:55.400
 but then we overload ourselves

54:55.400 --> 54:56.760
 and we have all of these distractions.

54:56.760 --> 54:58.560
 And then that causes,

54:58.560 --> 55:01.440
 it's like a cognitive action obesity type things

55:01.440 --> 55:02.800
 because it short circuits this system

55:02.800 --> 55:03.760
 that wants us to do things,

55:03.760 --> 55:05.680
 but we put more things on our plate than we can possibly do

55:05.680 --> 55:07.440
 and then we're really frustrated we can't do them

55:07.440 --> 55:09.160
 and we're short circuiting all of our wires.

55:09.160 --> 55:11.520
 So it all comes back to this question,

55:11.520 --> 55:16.520
 well, what would be the ideal sort of amount of stuff

55:16.840 --> 55:18.360
 to do and type of things to do?

55:18.360 --> 55:20.600
 Like if we wanted to look back at our ancestral environment

55:20.600 --> 55:23.920
 and say, if I could just build from scratch,

55:23.920 --> 55:26.480
 how much work I do and what I work on

55:26.480 --> 55:28.600
 to be as in touch with that as like paleo people

55:28.600 --> 55:30.080
 are trying to get their diets in touch with that.

55:30.080 --> 55:32.200
 And so now I'm just, well, see, this is,

55:32.200 --> 55:34.000
 it's something I made up,

55:34.000 --> 55:36.160
 but now I'm going deep on it.

55:36.160 --> 55:38.080
 And one of my podcast listeners I was talking about

55:38.080 --> 55:39.280
 on the show and I was like,

55:39.280 --> 55:41.400
 well, I get trying to learn about animals and boredom.

55:41.400 --> 55:42.840
 And she sent me this cool article

55:42.840 --> 55:44.560
 from an animal behaviorist journal

55:44.560 --> 55:48.080
 about what we know about human boredom versus animal boredom.

55:48.080 --> 55:49.960
 So trying to figure out that puzzle

55:49.960 --> 55:52.240
 is the wave that's high.

55:52.240 --> 55:54.120
 So I can get through the wave that's low of like,

55:54.120 --> 55:55.680
 I don't know about this pandemic book launch.

55:55.680 --> 55:59.760
 And my research is stumbling a little bit

55:59.760 --> 56:00.600
 because of the pandemic.

56:00.600 --> 56:03.640
 And so I needed a nice, you know, high.

56:03.640 --> 56:05.360
 So there we go, there's a case study.

56:05.360 --> 56:07.480
 Well, it's both a case study

56:07.480 --> 56:09.320
 and a very interesting set of concepts

56:09.320 --> 56:12.280
 because I didn't even realize that it's so simple.

56:12.280 --> 56:14.200
 I'm one of the people

56:14.200 --> 56:18.960
 that has a interesting push and pull dynamic with hunger,

56:18.960 --> 56:21.160
 trying to understand the hunger with myself.

56:21.160 --> 56:24.640
 Like I probably have an unhealthy relationship with food.

56:24.640 --> 56:28.440
 I don't know, but there's probably a perfect,

56:28.440 --> 56:32.760
 that's a nice way to think about diet as action.

56:32.760 --> 56:36.520
 There's probably an optimal diet response

56:36.520 --> 56:40.320
 to the experience that our body's telling us,

56:40.320 --> 56:43.280
 the signal that our body's sending, which is hunger.

56:43.280 --> 56:46.840
 And in that same way, boredom is sending a signal.

56:46.840 --> 56:49.960
 And most of our intellectual activities in this world,

56:49.960 --> 56:51.800
 our creative activities,

56:51.800 --> 56:56.640
 are essentially a response to that signal.

56:56.640 --> 56:59.680
 Yeah, and think about this analogy

56:59.680 --> 57:01.120
 that we have this hunger instinct

57:01.120 --> 57:03.960
 that junk food short circuits, right?

57:03.960 --> 57:06.760
 It's like, oh, we'll satisfy that hyper palatably

57:06.760 --> 57:08.280
 and it doesn't end up well.

57:08.280 --> 57:11.800
 Now think about modern attention engineered,

57:11.800 --> 57:14.560
 digitally mediated entertainment.

57:14.560 --> 57:16.040
 We have this boredom instinct.

57:16.040 --> 57:17.800
 Oh, we can take care of that

57:17.800 --> 57:20.520
 with a hyper palatable alternative.

57:20.520 --> 57:22.280
 Is that gonna lead to a similar problem?

57:22.280 --> 57:23.760
 So I've been fasting a lot lately,

57:23.760 --> 57:27.680
 like I'm doing eating once a day.

57:27.680 --> 57:29.640
 I've been doing that for over a month,

57:29.640 --> 57:33.800
 just eating one meal a day and primarily meat.

57:33.800 --> 57:38.280
 But it's very, fasting has been incredible for me,

57:38.280 --> 57:41.600
 for focus, for wellbeing, for, I don't know,

57:41.600 --> 57:43.040
 just for feeling good, okay?

57:43.040 --> 57:45.680
 We'll put on a chart what makes me feel good.

57:45.680 --> 57:50.680
 And that fasting and eating primarily a meat based diet

57:50.720 --> 57:52.480
 makes me feel really good.

57:52.480 --> 57:57.480
 And so, but that ultimately what fasting did,

57:57.760 --> 57:59.240
 I haven't fasted super long yet,

57:59.240 --> 58:02.080
 like a seven day diet, which I really like to do.

58:02.080 --> 58:05.080
 But even just fasting for a day for 24 hours

58:05.080 --> 58:09.920
 gets you in touch with your, with the signal.

58:09.920 --> 58:10.760
 It's fascinating.

58:10.760 --> 58:12.320
 Like you get to listen to your,

58:12.320 --> 58:15.000
 learn to listen to your body that like,

58:16.240 --> 58:17.680
 it's okay to be hungry.

58:17.680 --> 58:19.720
 It's like a little signal that sends you stuff.

58:19.720 --> 58:24.080
 And then I get to listen to how it responds

58:24.080 --> 58:27.480
 when I put food in my body.

58:27.480 --> 58:30.440
 Like, and I get to like, okay, cool.

58:30.440 --> 58:33.720
 So like food is a thing that pacifies the signal.

58:33.720 --> 58:35.520
 Like it sounds ridiculous, okay?

58:35.520 --> 58:36.360
 And you could do that with.

58:36.360 --> 58:38.280
 And do different types of food.

58:38.280 --> 58:39.120
 It feels different.

58:39.120 --> 58:41.640
 So you learn about what your body wants.

58:41.640 --> 58:44.120
 For some reason fasting,

58:44.120 --> 58:47.320
 it's similar to the deep work, embrace boredom.

58:47.320 --> 58:50.360
 Fasting allowed me to go into mode of listening,

58:50.360 --> 58:53.840
 of trying to understand the signal that I could say,

58:53.840 --> 58:57.840
 I have an unhealthy appreciation of fruit, okay?

58:57.840 --> 58:59.520
 I love apples and cherries.

58:59.520 --> 59:01.400
 Like, I don't know how to moderate them.

59:01.400 --> 59:03.480
 So if you take just same amount of calories,

59:03.480 --> 59:05.920
 I don't know calories matter, but they say calories.

59:05.920 --> 59:10.920
 2000 calories of cherries versus 2000 calories of steak.

59:11.520 --> 59:13.280
 If I eat 2000 calories of steak,

59:13.280 --> 59:17.160
 maybe just a little bit of like green beans or cauliflower,

59:17.160 --> 59:22.160
 I'm going to feel really good, fulfilled, focused and happy.

59:22.360 --> 59:24.440
 If I eat cherries, I'm going to be,

59:24.440 --> 59:28.400
 I'm going to wake up behind a dumpster crying with like naked

59:28.400 --> 59:29.680
 and like, it's just.

59:29.680 --> 59:30.520
 Pits all around.

59:30.520 --> 59:31.640
 Yeah, with everything.

59:31.640 --> 59:32.480
 Over your face, yeah.

59:32.480 --> 59:36.400
 And it's just like bloated, just not and unhappy.

59:36.400 --> 59:39.720
 And also the mood swings up and down.

59:39.720 --> 59:41.320
 I don't know.

59:41.320 --> 59:44.720
 And I'll be much hungrier the next day.

59:44.720 --> 59:46.240
 Sometimes it takes a couple of days.

59:46.240 --> 59:50.080
 But when I introduce carbs into the system, too many carbs,

59:50.080 --> 59:53.040
 it starts, it's just unhealthy.

59:53.040 --> 59:56.040
 I go into this roller coaster as opposed to a calm boat ride

59:56.040 --> 59:58.560
 along the river in the Amazon or something like that.

59:58.560 --> 1:00:01.600
 And so fasting was the mechanism for me

1:00:01.600 --> 1:00:03.960
 to start listening to the body.

1:00:03.960 --> 1:00:05.960
 I wonder if you can do that same kind of,

1:00:05.960 --> 1:00:07.920
 I guess that's what meditation a little bit is.

1:00:07.920 --> 1:00:10.160
 A little bit, but yeah, listen to boredom.

1:00:10.160 --> 1:00:11.040
 But so two years ago,

1:00:11.040 --> 1:00:13.560
 I had a book out called Digital Minimalism.

1:00:13.560 --> 1:00:16.120
 And one of the things I was recommending that people do

1:00:16.120 --> 1:00:18.320
 is basically a 30 day fast.

1:00:18.320 --> 1:00:20.440
 But from digital personal entertainment,

1:00:20.440 --> 1:00:21.920
 social media, online videos,

1:00:21.920 --> 1:00:26.400
 anything that captures your attention and dispels boredom.

1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:29.520
 And people were thinking like, oh, this is a detox.

1:00:29.520 --> 1:00:30.720
 Like, I just wanna teach your body

1:00:30.720 --> 1:00:32.760
 not to need the distraction, this or that.

1:00:32.760 --> 1:00:34.320
 But it really wasn't what I was interested in.

1:00:34.320 --> 1:00:37.640
 I wanted there to be space

1:00:37.640 --> 1:00:39.400
 that you could listen to your boredom.

1:00:39.400 --> 1:00:41.080
 Like, okay, I can't just dispel it.

1:00:41.080 --> 1:00:42.520
 I can't just look at the screen

1:00:42.520 --> 1:00:45.120
 and revel in it a little bit and start to listen to it

1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:48.000
 and say, what is this really pushing me towards?

1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:50.800
 And you take the new stuff, the new technology off the table

1:00:50.800 --> 1:00:52.440
 and sort of ask, what is this?

1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:53.280
 What am I craving?

1:00:53.280 --> 1:00:56.800
 Like, what's the activity equivalent of 2000 calories

1:00:56.800 --> 1:00:59.320
 of meat with a little bit of green beans on the side?

1:00:59.320 --> 1:01:01.600
 And I had 1700 people go through this experiment,

1:01:01.600 --> 1:01:03.400
 like spend 30 days doing this.

1:01:03.400 --> 1:01:04.280
 And it's hard at first,

1:01:04.280 --> 1:01:06.920
 but then they get used to listening to themselves

1:01:06.920 --> 1:01:07.800
 and sort of seeking out,

1:01:07.800 --> 1:01:09.680
 what is this really pushing me towards?

1:01:09.680 --> 1:01:12.240
 And it was pushing people towards connection.

1:01:12.240 --> 1:01:13.400
 It was pushing people towards,

1:01:13.400 --> 1:01:15.520
 I just wanna go be around other people.

1:01:15.520 --> 1:01:18.040
 It was pushing people towards high quality

1:01:18.040 --> 1:01:19.280
 leisure activities.

1:01:19.280 --> 1:01:21.640
 Like I wanna go do something that's complicated.

1:01:21.640 --> 1:01:23.200
 And it took weeks sometimes for them

1:01:23.200 --> 1:01:25.080
 to get in touch with their boredom,

1:01:25.080 --> 1:01:28.720
 but then it completely rewired how they thought about,

1:01:28.720 --> 1:01:30.720
 what do I wanna do with my time outside of work?

1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:32.000
 And then the idea is when you're done with that,

1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:33.240
 then it was much easier to go back

1:01:33.240 --> 1:01:34.880
 and completely change your digital life

1:01:34.880 --> 1:01:37.360
 because you have alternatives, right?

1:01:37.360 --> 1:01:39.800
 You're not just trying to abstain from things you don't like,

1:01:39.800 --> 1:01:42.600
 but that's basically a listening to boredom experiment.

1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:45.000
 Like just be there with the boredom

1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:46.240
 and see where it drives you

1:01:46.240 --> 1:01:48.720
 when you don't have the digital Cheez Its.

1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:50.840
 Okay, so if I can't do that,

1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:51.880
 where is it gonna drive me?

1:01:51.880 --> 1:01:53.800
 Well, I guess I kinda wanna go to the library,

1:01:53.800 --> 1:01:54.880
 which came up a lot, by the way,

1:01:54.880 --> 1:01:57.200
 a lot of people rediscovered the library.

1:01:57.200 --> 1:01:58.040
 With physical books.

1:01:58.040 --> 1:02:00.320
 Physical books, so like you can just go borrow them.

1:02:00.320 --> 1:02:03.040
 And there's like low pressure and you can explore

1:02:03.040 --> 1:02:04.720
 and you bring them home and then you read them

1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:06.480
 and you can like sit by the window and read them

1:02:06.480 --> 1:02:07.520
 and it's nice weather outside.

1:02:07.520 --> 1:02:09.560
 And I used to do that 20 years ago,

1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:10.800
 they're listening to boredom.

1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:12.800
 So can you maybe elaborate a little bit

1:02:12.800 --> 1:02:15.400
 on the different experiences that people had

1:02:15.400 --> 1:02:17.640
 when they quit social media for 30 days?

1:02:17.640 --> 1:02:20.560
 Like if you were to recommend that process,

1:02:20.560 --> 1:02:22.840
 what is ultimately the goal?

1:02:22.840 --> 1:02:24.520
 Yeah, digital minimalism,

1:02:24.520 --> 1:02:27.560
 that's my philosophy for all this tech.

1:02:27.560 --> 1:02:30.520
 And it's working backwards from what's important.

1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:33.000
 So it's you figure out what you're actually all about,

1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:33.960
 like what you wanna do,

1:02:33.960 --> 1:02:35.720
 what you wanna spend your time doing.

1:02:35.720 --> 1:02:37.480
 And then you can ask, okay,

1:02:37.480 --> 1:02:38.960
 is there a place that tech could amplify

1:02:38.960 --> 1:02:40.000
 or support some of these things?

1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:42.680
 And that's how you decide what tech to use.

1:02:42.680 --> 1:02:44.120
 And so the process is,

1:02:44.120 --> 1:02:46.320
 let's actually get away from everything,

1:02:46.320 --> 1:02:47.640
 let's be bored for a while,

1:02:47.640 --> 1:02:49.480
 let's really spend a month getting really figuring out

1:02:49.480 --> 1:02:50.880
 what do I actually wanna do?

1:02:50.880 --> 1:02:52.000
 What do I wanna spend my time doing?

1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:53.640
 What's important to me?

1:02:53.640 --> 1:02:54.520
 What makes me feel good?

1:02:54.520 --> 1:02:55.360
 And then when you're done,

1:02:55.360 --> 1:02:56.960
 you can bring back in tech very strategically

1:02:56.960 --> 1:02:58.560
 to help those things, right?

1:02:58.560 --> 1:02:59.800
 And that was the goal.

1:02:59.800 --> 1:03:01.680
 That turns out to be much more successful

1:03:01.680 --> 1:03:05.320
 than when people take a abstention only approach.

1:03:05.320 --> 1:03:08.840
 So if you come out your tech life and say,

1:03:08.840 --> 1:03:10.720
 you know, whatever, I look at Instagram too much.

1:03:10.720 --> 1:03:12.880
 Like I don't like how much I'm on Instagram,

1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:13.800
 that's a bad thing.

1:03:13.800 --> 1:03:15.120
 I wanna reduce this bad thing.

1:03:15.120 --> 1:03:16.320
 So here's my new thing,

1:03:16.320 --> 1:03:18.160
 I'm gonna spend less time looking at Instagram,

1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:20.680
 much less likely to succeed in the longterm.

1:03:20.680 --> 1:03:23.200
 So we're much less likely at trying to reduce

1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:24.480
 this sort of amorphous negative

1:03:24.480 --> 1:03:25.840
 because in the moment you're like,

1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:27.280
 yeah, but it's not that bad

1:03:27.280 --> 1:03:29.200
 and it would be kind of interesting to look at it now.

1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:30.880
 When you're instead controlling behavior

1:03:30.880 --> 1:03:32.720
 because you have a positive that you're aiming towards,

1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:33.720
 it's very powerful for people.

1:03:33.720 --> 1:03:35.920
 Like I want my life to be like this,

1:03:35.920 --> 1:03:39.120
 here's the role that tech plays in that life.

1:03:39.120 --> 1:03:41.240
 The connection to wanting your life to be like that

1:03:41.240 --> 1:03:42.440
 is very, very strong.

1:03:42.440 --> 1:03:43.680
 And then it's much, much easier to say,

1:03:43.680 --> 1:03:45.760
 yeah, like using Instagram is not part of my plan

1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:46.640
 for how I have that life.

1:03:46.640 --> 1:03:47.760
 And I really wanna have that life,

1:03:47.760 --> 1:03:49.000
 so of course I'm not gonna use Instagram.

1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:51.760
 So it turns out to be a much more sustainable way

1:03:51.760 --> 1:03:53.240
 to tame what's going on.

1:03:53.240 --> 1:03:55.320
 So if you quit social media for 30 days,

1:03:55.320 --> 1:03:58.080
 you kinda have to do the work.

1:03:58.080 --> 1:03:59.320
 You have to do the work.

1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:01.440
 Of thinking like, what am I actually,

1:04:01.440 --> 1:04:04.320
 what makes me happy in terms of these tools

1:04:04.320 --> 1:04:05.600
 that I've previously used

1:04:05.600 --> 1:04:08.880
 and when you try to integrate them back,

1:04:08.880 --> 1:04:10.840
 how can I integrate them to maximize

1:04:10.840 --> 1:04:11.680
 the thing that actually makes me happy?

1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:14.480
 Yeah, or what makes me happy unrelated to technology?

1:04:14.480 --> 1:04:16.240
 Like what do I actually, what do I want my life to be like?

1:04:16.240 --> 1:04:18.640
 Well, maybe what I wanna do is be like outside of nature

1:04:18.640 --> 1:04:20.160
 two hours a day and spend a lot more time

1:04:20.160 --> 1:04:21.960
 like helping my community and sacrificing

1:04:21.960 --> 1:04:23.120
 on behalf of my connections

1:04:23.120 --> 1:04:26.440
 and then have some sort of intellectually engaging

1:04:26.440 --> 1:04:28.200
 leisure activity like I'm reading

1:04:28.200 --> 1:04:29.600
 or trying to read the great books

1:04:29.600 --> 1:04:31.640
 and having more calm and seeing the sunset.

1:04:31.640 --> 1:04:34.800
 Like you create this picture and then you go back

1:04:34.800 --> 1:04:36.600
 and say, well, I still need my Facebook group

1:04:36.600 --> 1:04:39.800
 because that's how I keep up with my cycling group.

1:04:39.800 --> 1:04:41.280
 But Twitter is just, you know,

1:04:41.280 --> 1:04:42.800
 toxic, it's not helping any of these things.

1:04:42.800 --> 1:04:43.640
 And well, I'm an artist,

1:04:43.640 --> 1:04:46.280
 so I kinda need Instagram to get inspiration.

1:04:46.280 --> 1:04:48.200
 But if I know that's why I'm using Instagram,

1:04:48.200 --> 1:04:49.960
 I don't need it on my phone, it's just on my computer

1:04:49.960 --> 1:04:51.880
 and I just follow 10 artists and check it once a week.

1:04:51.880 --> 1:04:54.040
 Like you really can start deploying.

1:04:54.040 --> 1:04:55.000
 It was the number one thing

1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:56.600
 that differentiated in that experiment,

1:04:56.600 --> 1:04:59.960
 the people who ended up sustainably making changes

1:04:59.960 --> 1:05:02.200
 and getting through the 30 days and those who didn't,

1:05:02.200 --> 1:05:03.920
 was the people who did the experimentation

1:05:03.920 --> 1:05:04.760
 and the reflection.

1:05:04.760 --> 1:05:07.520
 Like let me try to figure out what's positive.

1:05:07.520 --> 1:05:09.200
 They were much more successful than the people

1:05:09.200 --> 1:05:11.960
 that just said, I'm sick of using my phone so much.

1:05:11.960 --> 1:05:12.920
 So I'm just gonna white knuckle it.

1:05:12.920 --> 1:05:14.120
 Just 30 days will be good for me.

1:05:14.120 --> 1:05:16.560
 I just gotta get away from it or something.

1:05:16.560 --> 1:05:17.640
 It doesn't last.

1:05:17.640 --> 1:05:19.840
 So you don't use social media currently.

1:05:19.840 --> 1:05:21.080
 Yeah.

1:05:21.080 --> 1:05:24.360
 Do you find that a lot of people going through this process

1:05:24.360 --> 1:05:29.360
 will seek to basically arrive at a similar place

1:05:29.400 --> 1:05:30.960
 to not use social media primarily?

1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:32.280
 About half.

1:05:32.280 --> 1:05:34.760
 Right, so about half when they went through this exercise,

1:05:34.760 --> 1:05:36.920
 and these aren't quantified numbers.

1:05:36.920 --> 1:05:40.160
 This is just, they sent me reports and yeah.

1:05:40.160 --> 1:05:42.080
 That's pretty good though, 1700?

1:05:42.080 --> 1:05:42.920
 Yeah, yeah.

1:05:42.920 --> 1:05:47.240
 So roughly half probably got rid of social media altogether.

1:05:47.240 --> 1:05:48.280
 Once they did this exercise,

1:05:48.280 --> 1:05:50.160
 they realized these things I care about,

1:05:50.160 --> 1:05:53.640
 I don't, social media's not the tools that's really helping.

1:05:53.640 --> 1:05:55.280
 The other half kept some,

1:05:55.280 --> 1:05:56.440
 there were some things in their life

1:05:56.440 --> 1:05:59.080
 where some social media was useful.

1:05:59.080 --> 1:06:00.160
 But the key thing is if they knew

1:06:00.160 --> 1:06:02.520
 why they were deploying social media,

1:06:02.520 --> 1:06:04.400
 they could put fences around it.

1:06:04.400 --> 1:06:07.120
 So for example, of those half that kept some social media,

1:06:07.120 --> 1:06:09.480
 almost none of them kept it on their phone.

1:06:09.480 --> 1:06:10.320
 Oh, interesting.

1:06:10.320 --> 1:06:12.120
 Yeah, you can't optimize if you don't know

1:06:12.120 --> 1:06:13.640
 what the function you're trying to optimize.

1:06:13.640 --> 1:06:14.680
 So it's like this huge hack.

1:06:14.680 --> 1:06:16.960
 Like once you know this is why I'm using Twitter,

1:06:16.960 --> 1:06:19.200
 then you can have a lot of rules about how you use Twitter.

1:06:19.200 --> 1:06:21.680
 And suddenly you take this cost benefit ratio

1:06:21.680 --> 1:06:24.160
 and it goes like way from the company's advantage

1:06:24.160 --> 1:06:25.840
 and then way over towards your advantage.

1:06:25.840 --> 1:06:26.960
 It's kind of fascinating

1:06:26.960 --> 1:06:29.320
 because I've been torn with social media,

1:06:29.320 --> 1:06:30.600
 but I did this kind of process.

1:06:30.600 --> 1:06:32.280
 I haven't actually done it for 30 days,

1:06:32.280 --> 1:06:33.720
 which I probably should.

1:06:33.720 --> 1:06:36.120
 I'll do it for like a week at a time and regularly

1:06:36.120 --> 1:06:41.120
 and thinking what kind of approach to Twitter works for me.

1:06:43.200 --> 1:06:46.280
 I'm distinctly aware of the fact

1:06:46.280 --> 1:06:51.200
 that I really enjoy posting once or twice a day.

1:06:51.200 --> 1:06:54.600
 And at that time checking from the previous post,

1:06:54.600 --> 1:06:59.600
 it makes me feel even when there's like negative comments,

1:06:59.800 --> 1:07:01.360
 they go right past me.

1:07:01.360 --> 1:07:03.520
 And when there's positive comments, it makes you smile.

1:07:03.520 --> 1:07:06.160
 I feel like love and connection with people,

1:07:06.160 --> 1:07:07.520
 especially with people I know,

1:07:07.520 --> 1:07:09.040
 but even just in general, it's like,

1:07:09.040 --> 1:07:12.200
 it makes me feel like the world is full of awesome people.

1:07:12.200 --> 1:07:15.800
 Okay, when you increase that from checking from two to like,

1:07:15.800 --> 1:07:17.480
 I don't know what the threshold is for me,

1:07:17.480 --> 1:07:19.920
 but probably like five or six per day,

1:07:19.920 --> 1:07:21.960
 it starts going to anxiety world.

1:07:21.960 --> 1:07:25.640
 Like where negative comments will actually stick

1:07:25.640 --> 1:07:30.640
 to me mentally and positive comments will feel more shallow.

1:07:33.680 --> 1:07:34.680
 It's kind of fascinating.

1:07:34.680 --> 1:07:39.680
 So I've been trying to, there's been long stretches of time,

1:07:41.760 --> 1:07:44.640
 I think December and January where I did just post

1:07:44.640 --> 1:07:46.360
 and check, post and check.

1:07:46.360 --> 1:07:49.040
 That makes me really happy.

1:07:49.040 --> 1:07:52.520
 Most of 2020 I did that, it made me really happy.

1:07:52.520 --> 1:07:56.040
 Recently I started like, I'll go,

1:07:56.040 --> 1:07:57.960
 you go right back in like a drug addict,

1:07:57.960 --> 1:08:00.680
 where you check it like, I don't know what that number is,

1:08:00.680 --> 1:08:01.640
 but that number is high.

1:08:01.640 --> 1:08:03.840
 Not good, you don't come out happy.

1:08:03.840 --> 1:08:06.000
 No one comes out of a day full of Twitter

1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:07.280
 celebrating humanity.

1:08:07.280 --> 1:08:08.720
 And it's not even,

1:08:08.720 --> 1:08:11.280
 cause I'm very fortunate to have a lot of just

1:08:11.280 --> 1:08:12.880
 positivity in the Twitter,

1:08:12.880 --> 1:08:16.160
 but there's just a general anxiety.

1:08:16.160 --> 1:08:19.840
 I wouldn't even say it's,

1:08:19.840 --> 1:08:21.400
 it's probably the thing that you're talking about

1:08:21.400 --> 1:08:22.640
 with the contact switching.

1:08:22.640 --> 1:08:25.800
 It's almost like an exhaustion.

1:08:25.800 --> 1:08:27.920
 I wouldn't even say it's like a negative feeling.

1:08:27.920 --> 1:08:29.520
 It's almost just an exhaustion

1:08:29.520 --> 1:08:32.960
 to where I'm not creating anything beautiful in my life,

1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:33.800
 just exhausted.

1:08:33.800 --> 1:08:35.240
 Like an existential exhaustion.

1:08:35.240 --> 1:08:36.920
 Existential exhaustion.

1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:39.560
 But I wonder, do you think it's possible to use

1:08:39.560 --> 1:08:42.240
 from the people you've seen from yourself

1:08:42.240 --> 1:08:45.560
 to use social media in the way I'm describing moderation?

1:08:45.560 --> 1:08:48.040
 Or is it always going to become?

1:08:48.040 --> 1:08:49.240
 When people do this exercise,

1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:52.320
 you get lots of configurations.

1:08:52.320 --> 1:08:56.080
 So for people that have a public presence, for example,

1:08:56.080 --> 1:08:58.840
 like what you're doing is not that unusual.

1:08:58.840 --> 1:09:02.200
 Okay, I post one thing a day and my audience likes it

1:09:02.200 --> 1:09:04.160
 and that's kind of it.

1:09:04.160 --> 1:09:05.760
 But you've thought through like, okay,

1:09:05.760 --> 1:09:06.960
 this supports something I value,

1:09:06.960 --> 1:09:09.440
 which is like having a sort of informal connection

1:09:09.440 --> 1:09:13.040
 with my audience and being exposed to some sort of

1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:15.640
 positive randomness.

1:09:15.640 --> 1:09:18.400
 Okay, then you could say if that's my goal,

1:09:18.400 --> 1:09:19.240
 what's the right way to do it?

1:09:19.240 --> 1:09:20.760
 Well, I don't need to be on Twitter on my phone all day.

1:09:20.760 --> 1:09:22.680
 Maybe what I do is every day at five,

1:09:22.680 --> 1:09:25.200
 I do my post and check on the day.

1:09:25.200 --> 1:09:28.800
 So I have a writer friend, Ryan Holiday,

1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:30.480
 who writes about the Stoics a lot.

1:09:30.480 --> 1:09:32.080
 And he has this similar strategy.

1:09:32.080 --> 1:09:36.480
 He posts one quote every day usually from a famous Stoic

1:09:36.480 --> 1:09:37.640
 and sometimes from a contemporary figure.

1:09:37.640 --> 1:09:38.480
 And that's just what he does.

1:09:38.480 --> 1:09:41.280
 He just posts it and it's a very positive thing.

1:09:41.280 --> 1:09:42.560
 Like his readers really love it

1:09:42.560 --> 1:09:44.320
 because it's just like a dose of inspiration.

1:09:44.320 --> 1:09:46.000
 He doesn't spend time.

1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:48.760
 He's never interacting with anyone on social media, right?

1:09:48.760 --> 1:09:51.000
 But that's an example of I figured out

1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:51.840
 what's important to me,

1:09:51.840 --> 1:09:54.040
 what's the best way to use tools to amplify it.

1:09:54.040 --> 1:09:56.280
 And then you get advantages out of the tools.

1:09:56.280 --> 1:09:57.560
 So I like what you're doing.

1:09:57.560 --> 1:09:59.280
 I looked you up, I looked up your Twitter feed

1:09:59.280 --> 1:10:00.520
 before I came over here.

1:10:00.520 --> 1:10:02.520
 I was curious, you're not on there a lot.

1:10:02.520 --> 1:10:04.000
 I don't see you yelling at people.

1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:07.600
 Now, do you think social media as a medium

1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:09.120
 changed the cultural standards?

1:10:09.120 --> 1:10:11.920
 And I mean it in a, have you read Neil Postman at all?

1:10:11.920 --> 1:10:14.040
 Have you read like a Amusing Ourselves to Death?

1:10:14.040 --> 1:10:16.040
 He was a social critic, technology critic

1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:19.760
 and wrote a lot about sort of technological determinism.

1:10:19.760 --> 1:10:22.440
 So the ways, which is a really influential idea

1:10:22.440 --> 1:10:23.280
 to a lot of my work,

1:10:23.280 --> 1:10:24.600
 which is actually a little out of fashion

1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:25.560
 right now in academia.

1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:28.120
 But the ways that the properties

1:10:28.120 --> 1:10:31.160
 and presence of technologies change things about humans

1:10:31.160 --> 1:10:32.600
 in a way that's not really intended

1:10:32.600 --> 1:10:33.880
 or planned by the humans themselves.

1:10:33.880 --> 1:10:35.080
 And that book is all about

1:10:35.080 --> 1:10:38.040
 how different communication medium,

1:10:38.040 --> 1:10:39.320
 like fundamentally just changed the way

1:10:39.320 --> 1:10:42.080
 the human brain understands and operates.

1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:43.400
 And so he sort of gets into the,

1:10:43.400 --> 1:10:45.680
 what happened when the printed word was widespread

1:10:45.680 --> 1:10:47.240
 and how television changed it.

1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:49.840
 And this was all pre social media.

1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:51.200
 But this is one of these ideas I'm having

1:10:51.200 --> 1:10:52.480
 is like what's the degree to which,

1:10:52.480 --> 1:10:54.000
 and I get into it sometimes on my show,

1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:54.840
 I get into a little bit,

1:10:54.840 --> 1:10:58.040
 like the degree to which like Twitter in particular

1:10:58.040 --> 1:11:00.160
 just changed the way that people conceptualized

1:11:00.160 --> 1:11:03.880
 what for example, debate and discussion was.

1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:06.080
 Like it introduced a rhetorical dunk culture

1:11:06.080 --> 1:11:08.120
 where it's sort of more about tribes

1:11:08.120 --> 1:11:10.240
 not giving ground to other tribes.

1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:12.000
 And it's like, it's a complete,

1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:14.760
 there's different places and times

1:11:14.760 --> 1:11:17.800
 when that type of discussion was thought of differently.

1:11:17.800 --> 1:11:19.200
 Well, yeah, absolutely.

1:11:19.200 --> 1:11:21.200
 But I tend to believe, I don't know what you think,

1:11:21.200 --> 1:11:23.240
 that there's the technological solutions.

1:11:23.240 --> 1:11:27.520
 Like there's literally different features in Twitter

1:11:27.520 --> 1:11:29.200
 that could completely reverse that.

1:11:29.200 --> 1:11:33.280
 There's so much power in the different choices that are made.

1:11:33.280 --> 1:11:36.200
 And it could still be highly engaging

1:11:36.200 --> 1:11:37.360
 and have very different effects.

1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:40.240
 Perhaps more negative or hopefully more positive.

1:11:40.240 --> 1:11:42.360
 Yeah, so I'm trying to pull these two things apart.

1:11:42.360 --> 1:11:45.200
 So there's these two ways social media,

1:11:45.200 --> 1:11:46.600
 let's say could change the experience

1:11:46.600 --> 1:11:49.120
 of reading a major newspaper today.

1:11:49.120 --> 1:11:50.960
 One could be a little bit more economic, right?

1:11:50.960 --> 1:11:53.360
 So the internet made it cheaper to get news.

1:11:53.360 --> 1:11:55.360
 The newspapers had to retreat to a paywall model

1:11:55.360 --> 1:11:56.960
 because it was the only way they were gonna survive.

1:11:56.960 --> 1:11:58.240
 But once you're in a paywall model,

1:11:58.240 --> 1:12:01.360
 then what you really wanna do is make your tribe,

1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:03.760
 which is within the paywall, very, very happy with you.

1:12:03.760 --> 1:12:04.880
 So you wanna work to them.

1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:07.480
 But then there's the sort of determinist point of view,

1:12:07.480 --> 1:12:10.280
 which is the properties of Twitter, which were arbitrary.

1:12:10.280 --> 1:12:13.840
 Jack and Evan just, whatever, let's just do it this way.

1:12:13.840 --> 1:12:15.720
 Influenced the very way that people now understand

1:12:15.720 --> 1:12:16.760
 and think about the world.

1:12:16.760 --> 1:12:19.520
 So the one influenced the other, I think.

1:12:19.520 --> 1:12:21.720
 They kind of started adjusting together.

1:12:21.720 --> 1:12:25.000
 I did this thing, I mean, I'm trying to understand this.

1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:30.000
 Part of the, I've been playing with the entrepreneurial idea.

1:12:30.320 --> 1:12:34.280
 That's a very particular dream I've had of a startup.

1:12:34.280 --> 1:12:37.200
 That this is a longer term thing,

1:12:37.200 --> 1:12:39.520
 it has to do with artificial intelligence.

1:12:39.520 --> 1:12:43.000
 But more and more, it seems like there's some trajectory

1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:47.400
 through creating social media type of technologies.

1:12:47.400 --> 1:12:49.520
 Very different than what people are thinking I'm doing.

1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:54.520
 But it's a kind of challenge to the way the Twitter is done.

1:12:55.120 --> 1:12:58.720
 But it's not obvious what the best mechanisms are

1:12:58.720 --> 1:13:01.840
 to still make an exceptionally engaging platform.

1:13:01.840 --> 1:13:03.960
 My clubhouse is very engaging.

1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:06.520
 And not have any other negative effects.

1:13:06.520 --> 1:13:08.880
 For example, there's Chrome extensions

1:13:08.880 --> 1:13:13.600
 that allow you to turn off all likes and dislikes

1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:14.960
 and all of that from Twitter.

1:13:14.960 --> 1:13:18.200
 So all you're seeing is just the content.

1:13:18.200 --> 1:13:21.480
 On Twitter, that to me creates,

1:13:21.480 --> 1:13:23.560
 that's not a compelling experience at all.

1:13:23.560 --> 1:13:26.880
 Because I still need, I would argue,

1:13:26.880 --> 1:13:28.400
 I still need the likes to know

1:13:28.400 --> 1:13:30.400
 what's a tweet worth reading.

1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:32.160
 Because I don't only have a limited amount of time,

1:13:32.160 --> 1:13:34.000
 so I need to know what's valuable.

1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:36.920
 It's like great Yelp reviews on tweets or something.

1:13:36.920 --> 1:13:40.600
 But I've turned off on, for example,

1:13:40.600 --> 1:13:45.600
 on my account on YouTube, I wrote a Chrome extension

1:13:45.960 --> 1:13:50.400
 that turns off all likes and dislikes and just views.

1:13:50.400 --> 1:13:53.000
 I don't know how many views the video gets and so on.

1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:53.840
 Unless it's on my phone.

1:13:53.840 --> 1:13:55.640
 Did you take off the recommendations?

1:13:57.640 --> 1:13:58.480
 No, no.

1:13:58.480 --> 1:13:59.480
 On YouTube, some people,

1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:02.080
 distraction for YouTube is a big one for people.

1:14:02.080 --> 1:14:04.040
 No, I'm not worried about the distraction

1:14:04.040 --> 1:14:06.880
 because I'm able to control myself on YouTube.

1:14:06.880 --> 1:14:07.840
 You don't rabbit hole.

1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:09.000
 No, I don't rabbit hole.

1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:11.160
 So you have to know your demons or your addictions

1:14:11.160 --> 1:14:12.000
 or whatever.

1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:13.360
 On YouTube, I'm okay.

1:14:13.360 --> 1:14:14.640
 I don't keep clicking.

1:14:14.640 --> 1:14:19.320
 The negative feelings come from seeing the views

1:14:19.320 --> 1:14:22.080
 on stuff you've created.

1:14:22.080 --> 1:14:24.080
 Oh, so you don't want to see your views.

1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:24.920
 Yeah.

1:14:24.920 --> 1:14:26.760
 So I'm just speaking to the things

1:14:26.760 --> 1:14:29.640
 that I'm aware of of myself that are helpful

1:14:29.640 --> 1:14:31.920
 and things that are not helpful emotionally.

1:14:31.920 --> 1:14:34.520
 And I feel like there should be,

1:14:34.520 --> 1:14:37.000
 we need to create actually tooling for ourselves.

1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:38.800
 That's not me with JavaScript,

1:14:38.800 --> 1:14:42.280
 but anybody is able to create,

1:14:42.280 --> 1:14:45.040
 sort of control the experience that they have.

1:14:45.040 --> 1:14:45.880
 Yeah.

1:14:45.880 --> 1:14:48.880
 Well, so my big unified theory on social media

1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:52.440
 is I'm very bearish on the big platforms

1:14:52.440 --> 1:14:53.760
 having a long future.

1:14:53.760 --> 1:14:54.600
 You are.

1:14:54.600 --> 1:14:57.920
 I think the moment of three or four major platforms

1:14:57.920 --> 1:15:01.200
 is not gonna last, right?

1:15:01.200 --> 1:15:02.240
 So I don't know.

1:15:02.240 --> 1:15:03.080
 Okay.

1:15:03.080 --> 1:15:03.920
 This is just perspective, right?

1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:07.000
 So you can start shorting these stocks on my,

1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:07.840
 don't tell.

1:15:07.840 --> 1:15:08.680
 It's not financial advice.

1:15:08.680 --> 1:15:09.520
 Yeah.

1:15:09.520 --> 1:15:10.360
 Yeah.

1:15:10.360 --> 1:15:11.200
 Don't do it Robinhood.

1:15:11.200 --> 1:15:12.880
 So here's, I think the big mistake

1:15:12.880 --> 1:15:17.200
 the major platforms made as when they took out

1:15:17.200 --> 1:15:19.400
 the network effect advantage, right?

1:15:19.400 --> 1:15:20.960
 So the original pitch,

1:15:20.960 --> 1:15:23.160
 especially if something like Facebook or Instagram

1:15:23.160 --> 1:15:26.440
 was the people you know are on here, right?

1:15:26.440 --> 1:15:28.560
 So like what you use this for is you can connect to people

1:15:28.560 --> 1:15:29.760
 that you already know.

1:15:29.760 --> 1:15:31.680
 This is what makes the network useful.

1:15:31.680 --> 1:15:34.760
 So therefore the value of our network grows quadratically

1:15:34.760 --> 1:15:35.800
 with the number of users.

1:15:35.800 --> 1:15:37.800
 And therefore it's such a headstart

1:15:37.800 --> 1:15:40.360
 that there's no way that someone else can catch up.

1:15:40.360 --> 1:15:42.680
 But when they shifted and when Facebook took the lead

1:15:42.680 --> 1:15:45.720
 of say we're gonna shift towards a newsfeed model,

1:15:45.720 --> 1:15:48.480
 they basically said we're going to try to in the moment

1:15:48.480 --> 1:15:50.280
 get more data and get more likes.

1:15:50.280 --> 1:15:51.320
 Like what we're gonna go towards

1:15:51.320 --> 1:15:54.320
 is actually just seeing interesting stuff.

1:15:54.320 --> 1:15:55.400
 Like seeing different information.

1:15:55.400 --> 1:15:58.280
 So people took this social internet impulse

1:15:58.280 --> 1:15:59.720
 to connect to people digitally,

1:15:59.720 --> 1:16:01.920
 to other tools like group text messages

1:16:01.920 --> 1:16:03.160
 and WhatsApp and stuff like this, right?

1:16:03.160 --> 1:16:04.400
 So you don't think about these tools

1:16:04.400 --> 1:16:06.480
 as oh, this is where I connect with people.

1:16:06.480 --> 1:16:09.160
 Once it's just a feed that's kind of interesting,

1:16:09.160 --> 1:16:10.800
 now you're competing with everything else

1:16:10.800 --> 1:16:13.480
 that can produce interesting content that's diverting.

1:16:13.480 --> 1:16:16.320
 And I think that is a much fiercer competition

1:16:16.320 --> 1:16:18.320
 because now for example, you're going up against podcasts,

1:16:18.320 --> 1:16:19.160
 right?

1:16:19.160 --> 1:16:20.720
 I mean like, okay, I guess the Twitter feed

1:16:20.720 --> 1:16:22.920
 is interesting right now,

1:16:22.920 --> 1:16:24.360
 but also a podcast is interesting

1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:25.600
 or something else could be interesting too.

1:16:25.600 --> 1:16:27.320
 I think it's a much fiercer competition

1:16:27.320 --> 1:16:29.920
 when there's no more network effects, right?

1:16:29.920 --> 1:16:32.240
 And so my sense is we're gonna see a fragmentation

1:16:32.240 --> 1:16:34.760
 into what I call long tail social media,

1:16:34.760 --> 1:16:38.480
 where if I don't need everyone I know to be on a platform,

1:16:38.480 --> 1:16:41.880
 then why not have three or four bespoke platforms I use

1:16:41.880 --> 1:16:44.880
 where it's a thousand people and we're all interested

1:16:44.880 --> 1:16:47.880
 in whatever, AI or comedy.

1:16:47.880 --> 1:16:50.080
 And we've perfected this interface

1:16:50.080 --> 1:16:52.080
 and maybe it's like Clubhouse, it's audio or something.

1:16:52.080 --> 1:16:54.240
 And we all pay $2 so that we don't have to worry

1:16:54.240 --> 1:16:55.800
 about attention harvesting.

1:16:55.800 --> 1:16:57.760
 And that's gonna be wildly more entertaining.

1:16:57.760 --> 1:17:00.600
 Like, I mean, I'm thinking about comedians on Twitter.

1:17:00.600 --> 1:17:04.080
 It's not the best internet possible format

1:17:04.080 --> 1:17:06.400
 for them expressing themselves and being interesting.

1:17:06.400 --> 1:17:08.080
 That you have all these comedians that are trying to like,

1:17:08.080 --> 1:17:10.040
 well, I can do like little clips and little whatever.

1:17:10.040 --> 1:17:13.000
 Like, I don't know if there was a long tail social media.

1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:14.440
 I mean, it's really, this is where the comedians are

1:17:14.440 --> 1:17:16.480
 and there's podcasts and the comedians are on podcasts now.

1:17:16.480 --> 1:17:19.440
 So this is my thought is that there's really no,

1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:21.200
 there's really no strong advantage

1:17:21.200 --> 1:17:25.920
 to having one large platform that everyone is on.

1:17:25.920 --> 1:17:27.240
 If all you're getting from it is,

1:17:27.240 --> 1:17:29.200
 I now have different options for diversion

1:17:29.200 --> 1:17:31.200
 and like uplifting aspirational

1:17:31.200 --> 1:17:33.320
 or whatever types of entertainment,

1:17:33.320 --> 1:17:34.560
 that whole thing could fragment.

1:17:34.560 --> 1:17:36.120
 And I think the glue that was holding together

1:17:36.120 --> 1:17:36.960
 was network effects.

1:17:36.960 --> 1:17:38.680
 I don't think they realized that when network effects

1:17:38.680 --> 1:17:40.040
 have been destabilized,

1:17:40.040 --> 1:17:41.960
 they don't have the centrifugal force anymore

1:17:41.960 --> 1:17:43.360
 and they're spinning faster and faster.

1:17:43.360 --> 1:17:46.680
 But is a Twitter feed really that much more interesting

1:17:46.680 --> 1:17:48.120
 than all of these streaming services?

1:17:48.120 --> 1:17:49.720
 Is it really that much more interesting

1:17:49.720 --> 1:17:52.360
 than Clubhouse, is it that much more interesting

1:17:52.360 --> 1:17:54.000
 than podcast?

1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:55.760
 I feel like they don't realize

1:17:55.760 --> 1:17:57.480
 how unstable their ground actually is.

1:17:57.480 --> 1:17:58.440
 Yeah, that's fascinating.

1:17:58.440 --> 1:18:03.440
 But the thing that makes Twitter and Facebook work,

1:18:03.840 --> 1:18:07.120
 I mean, the newsfeed, you're exactly right.

1:18:07.120 --> 1:18:08.840
 Like you can just duplicate the news.

1:18:08.840 --> 1:18:12.800
 Like if it's not the social network and it's the newsfeed,

1:18:12.800 --> 1:18:15.240
 then why not have multiple different feeds

1:18:15.240 --> 1:18:17.520
 that are more, that are better at satisfying.

1:18:17.520 --> 1:18:20.600
 There's a dopamine gamification that they've figured out.

1:18:20.600 --> 1:18:21.440
 Yeah.

1:18:21.440 --> 1:18:24.880
 And so you have to, whatever you create,

1:18:24.880 --> 1:18:27.360
 you have to at least provide some pleasure

1:18:27.360 --> 1:18:29.680
 in that same gamification kind of way.

1:18:29.680 --> 1:18:32.200
 It doesn't have to have to do with scale

1:18:32.200 --> 1:18:33.280
 of large social networks.

1:18:33.280 --> 1:18:36.160
 But I mean, I guess you're implying that

1:18:36.160 --> 1:18:39.520
 you should be able to design that kind of mechanism

1:18:39.520 --> 1:18:40.360
 in other forms.

1:18:40.360 --> 1:18:42.640
 Or people are turning on that gamification.

1:18:42.640 --> 1:18:44.520
 I mean, so people are getting wise to it

1:18:44.520 --> 1:18:46.280
 and are getting uncomfortable about it, right?

1:18:46.280 --> 1:18:49.040
 So if I'm offering something, these exist out here.

1:18:49.040 --> 1:18:49.880
 Like sugar.

1:18:49.880 --> 1:18:50.720
 People realize sugar's bad for you.

1:18:50.720 --> 1:18:51.560
 Yeah, sugar's great.

1:18:51.560 --> 1:18:52.400
 They're gonna stop eating it.

1:18:52.400 --> 1:18:53.240
 Yeah, drinking a lot's great too,

1:18:53.240 --> 1:18:56.080
 but also after a while you realize there's problems.

1:18:56.080 --> 1:18:58.120
 So some of the long tail social media networks

1:18:58.120 --> 1:18:59.800
 that are out there that I've looked at,

1:18:59.800 --> 1:19:02.880
 they offer usually like a deeper sense of connection.

1:19:02.880 --> 1:19:04.920
 Like it's usually interesting people

1:19:04.920 --> 1:19:06.160
 that you share some affinity

1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:08.160
 and you have these carefully cultivated.

1:19:08.160 --> 1:19:09.920
 I wrote this New Yorker piece a couple of years ago

1:19:09.920 --> 1:19:11.560
 about the indie social media movement

1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:14.920
 that really got into some of these different technologies.

1:19:14.920 --> 1:19:17.000
 But I think the technologies are a distraction.

1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:20.480
 We focus too much on Macedon versus whatever.

1:19:20.480 --> 1:19:21.800
 Like forget, or Discord.

1:19:21.800 --> 1:19:23.480
 Like actually let's forget the protocols right now.

1:19:23.480 --> 1:19:26.040
 It's the idea of, okay.

1:19:26.040 --> 1:19:28.520
 And there's a lot of these long tail social media groups,

1:19:28.520 --> 1:19:29.560
 what people are getting out of it,

1:19:29.560 --> 1:19:32.920
 which I think can outweigh the dopamine gamification

1:19:32.920 --> 1:19:35.160
 is strong connection and motivation.

1:19:35.160 --> 1:19:36.960
 Like you're in a group with other guys

1:19:36.960 --> 1:19:39.640
 that are all trying to be better dads

1:19:39.640 --> 1:19:40.480
 or something like this.

1:19:40.480 --> 1:19:42.680
 And you talk to them on a regular basis

1:19:42.680 --> 1:19:43.720
 and you're sharing your stories

1:19:43.720 --> 1:19:45.720
 and there's interesting talks.

1:19:45.720 --> 1:19:47.440
 And that's a powerful thing too.

1:19:47.440 --> 1:19:49.800
 One interesting thing about scale of Twitter

1:19:49.800 --> 1:19:53.200
 is you have these viral spread of information.

1:19:53.200 --> 1:19:57.040
 So sort of Twitter has become a newsmaker in itself.

1:19:57.040 --> 1:19:58.560
 Yeah, I think it's a problem.

1:19:58.560 --> 1:20:01.080
 Well, yes, but I wonder what replaces that

1:20:01.080 --> 1:20:03.520
 because then you immediately.

1:20:03.520 --> 1:20:04.360
 Reporting?

1:20:04.360 --> 1:20:05.200
 Well, no.

1:20:05.200 --> 1:20:07.320
 Reporters have to do some work again, I don't know.

1:20:07.320 --> 1:20:09.720
 The problem with reporters and journalism

1:20:09.720 --> 1:20:12.360
 is that they're intermediary.

1:20:12.360 --> 1:20:14.080
 They have control.

1:20:14.080 --> 1:20:15.960
 I mean, this is the problem in Russia currently

1:20:15.960 --> 1:20:20.960
 is that it creates a shield between the people and the news.

1:20:22.400 --> 1:20:25.080
 The interesting thing and the powerful thing about Twitter

1:20:25.080 --> 1:20:28.040
 is that the news originates from the individual

1:20:28.040 --> 1:20:29.000
 that's creating the news.

1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:33.200
 Like you have the former president of the United States

1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:34.880
 on Twitter creating news.

1:20:34.880 --> 1:20:36.760
 You have Elon Musk creating news.

1:20:36.760 --> 1:20:39.560
 You have people announcing stuff on Twitter

1:20:39.560 --> 1:20:41.440
 as opposed to talking to a journalist.

1:20:41.440 --> 1:20:44.000
 And that feels much more genuine

1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:48.320
 and it feels very powerful,

1:20:48.320 --> 1:20:49.960
 but actually coming to realize

1:20:49.960 --> 1:20:53.040
 it doesn't need the social network.

1:20:53.040 --> 1:20:54.680
 You can just put that announcement

1:20:54.680 --> 1:20:56.000
 on a YouTube type thing.

1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:56.840
 This is what I'm thinking.

1:20:56.840 --> 1:20:58.280
 Right, so this is my point about that

1:20:58.280 --> 1:20:59.680
 because that's right.

1:20:59.680 --> 1:21:01.880
 The democratizing power of the internet is fantastic.

1:21:01.880 --> 1:21:03.680
 I mean, I'm an old school internet nerd,

1:21:03.680 --> 1:21:06.440
 a guy that was telemeting in the servers

1:21:06.440 --> 1:21:08.720
 and gophering before the World Wide Web was around, right?

1:21:08.720 --> 1:21:10.120
 So I'm a huge internet booster.

1:21:10.120 --> 1:21:12.320
 And that's one of its big power.

1:21:12.320 --> 1:21:14.400
 But when you put everything on Twitter,

1:21:14.400 --> 1:21:16.640
 I think the fact that you've taken,

1:21:16.640 --> 1:21:18.400
 you homogenized everything, right?

1:21:18.400 --> 1:21:20.200
 So everything looks the same,

1:21:20.200 --> 1:21:22.760
 moves with the same low friction is very difficult.

1:21:22.760 --> 1:21:25.320
 You have no what I call distributed curation, right?

1:21:25.320 --> 1:21:27.080
 The only curation that really happens,

1:21:27.080 --> 1:21:29.560
 there's a little bit with likes and also the algorithm.

1:21:29.560 --> 1:21:33.760
 But if you look back to pre web 2.0 or early web 2.0,

1:21:33.760 --> 1:21:34.760
 when a lot of this was happening,

1:21:34.760 --> 1:21:37.480
 let's say on blogs where people own their own servers

1:21:37.480 --> 1:21:39.240
 and you had your different blogs,

1:21:39.240 --> 1:21:41.400
 there was this distributed curation that happened

1:21:41.400 --> 1:21:45.400
 where in order for your blog to get on people's radar

1:21:45.400 --> 1:21:47.600
 and this had nothing to do with any gatekeepers

1:21:47.600 --> 1:21:51.080
 or legacy media, it was over time you got more links

1:21:51.080 --> 1:21:52.080
 and people respected you

1:21:52.080 --> 1:21:53.520
 and you would hear about this blog over here

1:21:53.520 --> 1:21:55.320
 and there's this whole distributed curation

1:21:55.320 --> 1:21:56.800
 and filtering going on.

1:21:56.800 --> 1:22:00.080
 So if you think like the 2004 presidential election,

1:22:00.080 --> 1:22:02.280
 most of the information people are getting from the internet

1:22:02.280 --> 1:22:05.840
 was one of the first big internet news driven elections

1:22:05.840 --> 1:22:09.480
 was from, you had like the daily costs and drudge,

1:22:09.480 --> 1:22:11.080
 but there was like blogs that were out there

1:22:11.080 --> 1:22:13.560
 and this was back, Ezra Klein was just running a blog

1:22:13.560 --> 1:22:16.360
 out of his dorm room at this point, right?

1:22:16.360 --> 1:22:20.800
 And you would in a distributed fashion gain credibility

1:22:20.800 --> 1:22:22.680
 because okay, people have paid,

1:22:22.680 --> 1:22:24.160
 it's very hard to get people to pay attention to your blog,

1:22:24.160 --> 1:22:26.560
 they're paying attention, they get linked to this kid Ezra

1:22:26.560 --> 1:22:28.160
 or whatever, it seems to be really sharp

1:22:28.160 --> 1:22:29.840
 and now people are noticing it

1:22:29.840 --> 1:22:32.240
 and now you have a distributed curation

1:22:32.240 --> 1:22:34.200
 that solves a lot of the problems we see

1:22:34.200 --> 1:22:36.200
 when you have a completely homogenized low friction

1:22:36.200 --> 1:22:38.400
 environment like friction where, I mean Twitter,

1:22:38.400 --> 1:22:41.240
 where any random conspiracy theory or whatever

1:22:41.240 --> 1:22:44.720
 that people like can just shoot through and spread,

1:22:44.720 --> 1:22:46.560
 whereas if you're starting a blog

1:22:46.560 --> 1:22:49.640
 to try to push QAnon or something like that,

1:22:49.640 --> 1:22:51.560
 it's probably gonna be a really weird looking blog

1:22:51.560 --> 1:22:52.520
 and you're gonna have a hard time,

1:22:52.520 --> 1:22:55.680
 like it's just never gonna show up on people's radar, right?

1:22:55.680 --> 1:22:58.800
 So everything you've said up until the very last statement,

1:22:58.800 --> 1:23:01.000
 I would agree with.

1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:03.400
 This is a topic I don't know a ton about, I guess, QAnon.

1:23:03.400 --> 1:23:07.240
 There's, I think, I'll forget QAnon.

1:23:07.240 --> 1:23:08.080
 Yeah, no, we can.

1:23:08.080 --> 1:23:10.040
 But QAnon is, QAnon could be that,

1:23:10.040 --> 1:23:12.000
 I also don't know, I should know more,

1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:13.720
 I apologize, I don't know more.

1:23:13.720 --> 1:23:17.280
 I mean, that's a power and the downside,

1:23:17.280 --> 1:23:21.720
 you can have, I mean, Hitler could have a blog today

1:23:21.720 --> 1:23:24.240
 and you would have potentially a very large following

1:23:24.240 --> 1:23:28.280
 if he's charismatic, if he's as good with words,

1:23:28.280 --> 1:23:29.960
 is able to express the ideas,

1:23:29.960 --> 1:23:32.040
 whatever maybe he's able to channel,

1:23:32.040 --> 1:23:33.720
 the frustration, the anger that people have

1:23:33.720 --> 1:23:34.640
 about a certain thing.

1:23:34.640 --> 1:23:37.360
 And so I think that's the power of blogs,

1:23:37.360 --> 1:23:39.760
 but it's also the limitation, but that doesn't,

1:23:39.760 --> 1:23:40.600
 we're not trying to solve that.

1:23:40.600 --> 1:23:41.920
 You can't solve that, yeah.

1:23:41.920 --> 1:23:45.040
 The fundamental problem you're saying is not the problem.

1:23:45.040 --> 1:23:48.160
 Your thesis is that there's nothing special

1:23:48.160 --> 1:23:51.080
 about large scale social networks

1:23:51.080 --> 1:23:53.600
 that guarantees that they will keep existing.

1:23:53.600 --> 1:23:55.040
 And it's important to remember

1:23:55.040 --> 1:23:58.280
 for a lot of the older generation of internet activists

1:23:58.280 --> 1:24:01.280
 or the people who are very pro internet in the early days,

1:24:01.280 --> 1:24:03.960
 they were completely flabbergasted

1:24:03.960 --> 1:24:05.600
 by the rise of these platforms.

1:24:05.600 --> 1:24:08.600
 Say, why would you take the internet

1:24:08.600 --> 1:24:11.000
 and then build your own version of the internet

1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:12.640
 where you own all the servers?

1:24:12.640 --> 1:24:14.520
 And we built this whole distributed,

1:24:14.520 --> 1:24:16.600
 the whole thing, we had open protocols.

1:24:16.600 --> 1:24:18.640
 Everyone anywhere in the world could use the same protocols.

1:24:18.640 --> 1:24:20.000
 Your machine can talk to any other machine.

1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:23.320
 It's the most democratic communication system

1:24:23.320 --> 1:24:24.280
 that's ever been built.

1:24:24.280 --> 1:24:25.560
 And then these companies came along and said,

1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:26.600
 we're gonna build our own,

1:24:26.600 --> 1:24:27.520
 we'll just own all the servers

1:24:27.520 --> 1:24:29.160
 and put them in buildings that we own.

1:24:29.160 --> 1:24:31.000
 And the internet will just be the first mile

1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:32.480
 that gets you into our private internet

1:24:32.480 --> 1:24:33.800
 where we owned the whole thing.

1:24:33.800 --> 1:24:37.920
 It went completely against the entire motivation

1:24:37.920 --> 1:24:39.160
 of the internet was like, yes,

1:24:39.160 --> 1:24:41.320
 it's not gonna be one person owns all the servers

1:24:41.320 --> 1:24:42.280
 and you pay to access them.

1:24:42.280 --> 1:24:43.880
 It's any one server that they own

1:24:43.880 --> 1:24:45.120
 could talk to anyone else's server

1:24:45.120 --> 1:24:48.440
 because we all agree on a standard set of protocols.

1:24:48.440 --> 1:24:51.720
 And so the old guard of pro internet people

1:24:51.720 --> 1:24:54.000
 never understood this move towards

1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:56.600
 let's build private versions of the internet.

1:24:57.680 --> 1:24:59.080
 We'll build three or four private internets

1:24:59.080 --> 1:25:00.120
 and that's what we'll all use.

1:25:00.120 --> 1:25:01.760
 It was the opposite basically.

1:25:01.760 --> 1:25:03.400
 Well, it's funny enough, I don't know if you follow,

1:25:03.400 --> 1:25:07.600
 but Jack Dorsey is also as a proponent

1:25:07.600 --> 1:25:11.600
 and is helping to fund, create fully distributed

1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:13.000
 versions of Twitter, essentially,

1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:15.960
 I think that would potentially destroy Twitter.

1:25:15.960 --> 1:25:18.520
 But I think there might be financial,

1:25:19.520 --> 1:25:21.920
 like business cases to be made there, I'm not sure.

1:25:21.920 --> 1:25:23.680
 But that seems to be another alternative

1:25:23.680 --> 1:25:28.680
 as opposed to creating a bunch of like the long tail,

1:25:28.680 --> 1:25:31.520
 creating like the ultimate long tail

1:25:31.520 --> 1:25:33.240
 of like fully distributed.

1:25:33.240 --> 1:25:35.080
 Yeah, which is what the internet is.

1:25:35.080 --> 1:25:36.280
 But that's sort of my long,

1:25:36.280 --> 1:25:37.840
 when I'm thinking about long tail social media,

1:25:37.840 --> 1:25:40.960
 I'm thinking it's like the tech's not so important.

1:25:40.960 --> 1:25:42.680
 Like there's groups out there, right?

1:25:42.680 --> 1:25:45.720
 I know where the tech they use to actually implement

1:25:45.720 --> 1:25:47.640
 their digital only social group, whatever,

1:25:47.640 --> 1:25:50.000
 they might use Slack, they might use some combination

1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:51.040
 of Zoom or it doesn't matter.

1:25:51.040 --> 1:25:52.720
 I think in the tech world,

1:25:52.720 --> 1:25:54.800
 we wanna build the beautiful protocol

1:25:54.800 --> 1:25:56.080
 that okay, everyone's gonna use

1:25:56.080 --> 1:25:58.640
 as just a federated server protocol

1:25:58.640 --> 1:25:59.840
 in which we've worked out X, Y, and Z,

1:25:59.840 --> 1:26:00.720
 and no one understands it

1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:02.280
 because then the engineers need it all to make,

1:26:02.280 --> 1:26:03.480
 I get it because I'm a nerd like this,

1:26:03.480 --> 1:26:05.720
 like, okay, every standard has to fit with everything else

1:26:05.720 --> 1:26:07.400
 and no one understands what's going on.

1:26:07.400 --> 1:26:10.520
 Meanwhile, you have this group of bike enthusiasts

1:26:10.520 --> 1:26:12.360
 that are like, yeah, we'll just jump on to Zoom

1:26:12.360 --> 1:26:14.240
 and have some Slack and put up a blog.

1:26:14.240 --> 1:26:15.680
 The tech doesn't really matter.

1:26:15.680 --> 1:26:17.640
 Like we built a world with our own curation,

1:26:17.640 --> 1:26:21.960
 our own rules, our own sort of social ecosystem

1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:23.400
 that's generating a lot of value.

1:26:23.400 --> 1:26:24.880
 I mean, I don't know if it'll happen.

1:26:24.880 --> 1:26:27.280
 There's a lot of money at stake with obviously these large,

1:26:27.280 --> 1:26:29.480
 but I just think they're more,

1:26:29.480 --> 1:26:30.840
 they're so, I mean, look how quickly

1:26:30.840 --> 1:26:33.400
 Americans left Facebook, right?

1:26:33.400 --> 1:26:35.560
 I mean, Facebook was savvy to buy other properties

1:26:35.560 --> 1:26:36.720
 and to diversify, right?

1:26:36.720 --> 1:26:37.880
 But how quick did that take

1:26:37.880 --> 1:26:40.800
 for just standard Facebook news feed?

1:26:40.800 --> 1:26:42.960
 Everyone under the age of something were using it

1:26:42.960 --> 1:26:44.520
 and no one under a certain age is using it now.

1:26:44.520 --> 1:26:45.360
 It took like four years.

1:26:45.360 --> 1:26:47.520
 I mean, this stuff is really.

1:26:47.520 --> 1:26:50.920
 I believe people can leave Facebook overnight.

1:26:50.920 --> 1:26:51.760
 Yeah.

1:26:51.760 --> 1:26:54.480
 Like I think Facebook hasn't actually messed up

1:26:54.480 --> 1:26:57.920
 like enough to, there's two things.

1:26:57.920 --> 1:26:58.800
 They haven't messed up enough

1:26:58.800 --> 1:27:00.600
 for people to really leave aggressively

1:27:00.600 --> 1:27:03.880
 and there's no good alternative for them to leave.

1:27:03.880 --> 1:27:06.200
 I think if good alternatives pop up,

1:27:06.200 --> 1:27:07.600
 it would just immediately happen.

1:27:07.600 --> 1:27:10.280
 The stuff is a lot more culturally fragile, I think.

1:27:10.280 --> 1:27:11.440
 I mean, Twitter's having a moment

1:27:11.440 --> 1:27:13.200
 because it was feeding a certain type of,

1:27:13.200 --> 1:27:14.240
 I mean, there's a lot of anxieties

1:27:14.240 --> 1:27:16.480
 that was in the sort of political sphere anyways

1:27:16.480 --> 1:27:19.080
 that Twitter was working with,

1:27:20.240 --> 1:27:21.680
 but its moment could go to as well.

1:27:21.680 --> 1:27:23.440
 I mean, it's a really arbitrary thing.

1:27:23.440 --> 1:27:24.920
 Short little things.

1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:27.480
 I read a Wired article about this earlier in the pandemic.

1:27:27.480 --> 1:27:29.560
 This is crazy that the way

1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:31.400
 that we're trying to communicate information

1:27:31.400 --> 1:27:34.120
 about the pandemic is all these weird arbitrary rules

1:27:34.120 --> 1:27:37.120
 where people are screenshotting pictures of articles

1:27:37.120 --> 1:27:38.360
 that are part of a tweet thread

1:27:38.360 --> 1:27:40.960
 where you say one slash in under it.

1:27:40.960 --> 1:27:43.120
 We have the technology guys

1:27:43.120 --> 1:27:47.120
 to really clearly convey long form information to people.

1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:48.400
 Why do we have these?

1:27:48.400 --> 1:27:50.440
 And I know this because it's the gamified dopamine hits,

1:27:50.440 --> 1:27:52.320
 but what a weird medium.

1:27:52.320 --> 1:27:55.440
 There's no reason for us to have to have these threads

1:27:55.440 --> 1:27:57.840
 that you have to find and pin with your screenshot.

1:27:57.840 --> 1:27:58.920
 I mean, we have technology

1:27:58.920 --> 1:28:00.480
 to communicate better using the internet.

1:28:00.480 --> 1:28:05.120
 I mean, why are epidemiologists having to do tweet threads?

1:28:05.120 --> 1:28:06.960
 Because there's mechanisms of publishing

1:28:06.960 --> 1:28:08.680
 that make it easier on Twitter.

1:28:08.680 --> 1:28:10.800
 I mean, we're evolving as a species

1:28:10.800 --> 1:28:12.880
 and the internet is a very fresh thing.

1:28:12.880 --> 1:28:16.120
 And so it's kind of interesting to think

1:28:16.120 --> 1:28:18.400
 that as opposed to Twitter,

1:28:18.400 --> 1:28:20.280
 this is what Jack also complains about

1:28:20.280 --> 1:28:23.160
 is Twitter's not innovating fast enough.

1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:26.840
 And so it's almost like the people are innovating

1:28:26.840 --> 1:28:30.360
 and thinking about their productive life faster

1:28:30.360 --> 1:28:33.680
 than the platforms on which they operate can catch up.

1:28:33.680 --> 1:28:37.480
 And so at the point the gap grows sufficiently,

1:28:37.480 --> 1:28:38.520
 they'll jump.

1:28:38.520 --> 1:28:40.400
 A few people, a few innovative folks

1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:42.600
 will just create an alternative

1:28:42.600 --> 1:28:47.600
 and perhaps distributed perhaps just many little silos

1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:49.040
 and then people will jump

1:28:49.040 --> 1:28:50.600
 and then we'll just continue this kind of way.

1:28:50.600 --> 1:28:52.360
 Yeah, but see, I think like Substack, for example,

1:28:52.360 --> 1:28:53.640
 what they're gonna pull out of Twitter,

1:28:53.640 --> 1:28:56.440
 among other things, is the audience that was,

1:28:56.440 --> 1:28:58.920
 let's say, like slightly left of center,

1:28:58.920 --> 1:29:03.080
 but slightly left of center, don't like Trump,

1:29:03.080 --> 1:29:05.480
 uncomfortable with like postmodern critical theories

1:29:05.480 --> 1:29:07.480
 made into political action, right?

1:29:07.480 --> 1:29:08.480
 And they're like, yeah, Twitter,

1:29:08.480 --> 1:29:10.200
 there was people on there talking about this

1:29:10.200 --> 1:29:12.400
 and it made me feel sort of hurt

1:29:12.400 --> 1:29:14.200
 because I was feeling a little bit like a nerd about it.

1:29:14.200 --> 1:29:16.120
 But honestly, I'd probably rather subscribe

1:29:16.120 --> 1:29:19.320
 to the four subs, you know, I'm gonna have like Barry's

1:29:19.320 --> 1:29:20.840
 and Andrew Sullivan's, I'll have like a Jesse Signals,

1:29:20.840 --> 1:29:22.920
 like I'll have a few substacks I can subscribe to

1:29:22.920 --> 1:29:26.920
 and honestly, I'm a knowledge worker who's 32 anyways,

1:29:26.920 --> 1:29:28.240
 probably that's an email all day.

1:29:28.240 --> 1:29:30.280
 And so like, there's an innovation that's gonna,

1:29:30.280 --> 1:29:32.560
 that group, you know, it's gonna suck them off.

1:29:32.560 --> 1:29:34.280
 Which is actually a very large group.

1:29:34.280 --> 1:29:36.480
 Yeah, that's a lot of energy.

1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:37.480
 And then once Trump's gone,

1:29:37.480 --> 1:29:38.800
 I guess that's probably gonna drive,

1:29:38.800 --> 1:29:42.320
 that drove a lot of more like Trump people off Twitter.

1:29:42.320 --> 1:29:44.520
 Like this stuff is fragile, I think.

1:29:44.520 --> 1:29:47.080
 I, but the fascinating thing to me,

1:29:47.080 --> 1:29:50.720
 because I've hung out on Parler for a short amount enough

1:29:50.720 --> 1:29:52.800
 to know that the interface matters.

1:29:52.800 --> 1:29:54.760
 It's so fascinating like that,

1:29:54.760 --> 1:29:57.480
 that it's not just about ideas.

1:29:57.480 --> 1:30:00.200
 It's about creating like Substack 2,

1:30:01.280 --> 1:30:04.520
 creating a pleasant experience, a dicting experience.

1:30:04.520 --> 1:30:05.600
 No, you're right, you're right about that.

1:30:05.600 --> 1:30:06.640
 And it's hard.

1:30:06.640 --> 1:30:08.240
 And it's why the, this is one of the conclusions

1:30:08.240 --> 1:30:09.880
 from that indie social media article

1:30:09.880 --> 1:30:12.160
 is it's just the ugliness matters.

1:30:12.160 --> 1:30:13.440
 And I don't mean even just aesthetically,

1:30:13.440 --> 1:30:15.760
 it's just the clunkiness of the interfaces.

1:30:17.160 --> 1:30:18.360
 And I don't know, it's,

1:30:18.360 --> 1:30:19.840
 to some degree, the social media companies

1:30:19.840 --> 1:30:21.120
 have spent a lot of money on this.

1:30:21.120 --> 1:30:24.000
 And to some degree, it's a survivorship bias, right?

1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:26.920
 I think Twitter, every time I hear Jack talks about this,

1:30:26.920 --> 1:30:30.160
 it seems like he's as surprised as anyone else,

1:30:30.160 --> 1:30:31.160
 the way Twitter is being used.

1:30:31.160 --> 1:30:33.320
 I mean, it's basically the way, you know,

1:30:33.320 --> 1:30:36.600
 they had it years ago.

1:30:36.600 --> 1:30:38.080
 And then, you know, it was like, great,

1:30:38.080 --> 1:30:39.560
 there'll be statuses, right?

1:30:39.560 --> 1:30:41.120
 This is what I'm doing, you know?

1:30:41.120 --> 1:30:42.600
 And my friends can follow me and see it.

1:30:42.600 --> 1:30:43.640
 Without really changing anything,

1:30:43.640 --> 1:30:46.000
 it just happened to hit everything right

1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:47.560
 to support this other type of interaction.

1:30:47.560 --> 1:30:49.440
 Well, there's also the JavaScript model,

1:30:49.440 --> 1:30:51.360
 which Brendan Eich talked about.

1:30:51.360 --> 1:30:53.440
 He just implemented JavaScript,

1:30:53.440 --> 1:30:55.760
 like the crappy version of JavaScript in 10 days,

1:30:55.760 --> 1:31:00.360
 threw it out there and just changed it really quickly,

1:31:00.360 --> 1:31:01.400
 evolved it really quickly.

1:31:01.400 --> 1:31:04.240
 And now it's become, according to Stack Exchange,

1:31:04.240 --> 1:31:06.120
 the most popular programming language in the world

1:31:06.120 --> 1:31:08.320
 that drives like most of the internet

1:31:08.320 --> 1:31:10.960
 and even the backend and now mobile.

1:31:10.960 --> 1:31:14.200
 And so that's an argument for the kind of thing

1:31:14.200 --> 1:31:18.120
 you're talking about where like the bike club people

1:31:18.120 --> 1:31:21.760
 could literally create the thing that would, you know,

1:31:21.760 --> 1:31:24.560
 run most of the internet in 10 years from now.

1:31:24.560 --> 1:31:25.400
 Yeah.

1:31:25.400 --> 1:31:27.000
 So there's something to that,

1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:29.320
 like as opposed to trying to get lucky

1:31:29.320 --> 1:31:30.480
 or trying to think through stuff

1:31:30.480 --> 1:31:33.320
 is just to solve a particular problem.

1:31:33.320 --> 1:31:34.160
 Do stuff, yeah.

1:31:34.160 --> 1:31:35.000
 And then do stuff.

1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:36.840
 Do stuff, keep tinkering until you love it.

1:31:36.840 --> 1:31:37.680
 Yeah. Yeah.

1:31:37.680 --> 1:31:41.360
 And then, and of course the sad thing is timing and luck

1:31:41.360 --> 1:31:43.880
 matter and that you can't really control.

1:31:43.880 --> 1:31:44.720
 That's the problem.

1:31:44.720 --> 1:31:45.560
 Yeah.

1:31:45.560 --> 1:31:47.840
 But you can't go back to 2007.

1:31:47.840 --> 1:31:48.680
 Yeah.

1:31:48.680 --> 1:31:49.520
 That's like the number one thing you could do

1:31:49.520 --> 1:31:51.080
 to have a lot of success with a new platform

1:31:51.080 --> 1:31:53.480
 is go back in time 14 years.

1:31:53.480 --> 1:31:55.120
 So the thing you have to kind of think about

1:31:55.120 --> 1:31:58.360
 is what is the like, what's the totally new thing

1:31:59.200 --> 1:32:03.040
 that 10 years from now would seem obvious.

1:32:03.040 --> 1:32:05.280
 I mean, some people saying clubhouses that,

1:32:05.280 --> 1:32:08.080
 there's been a lot of stuff like clubhouse before,

1:32:08.080 --> 1:32:11.280
 but it hit the right kind of thing.

1:32:12.640 --> 1:32:14.120
 Similar to Tesla actually,

1:32:14.120 --> 1:32:16.600
 what clubhouse did is it got a lot of

1:32:16.600 --> 1:32:19.320
 relatively famous people on there quickly.

1:32:19.320 --> 1:32:24.120
 And then the other effect is like, it's invite only.

1:32:24.120 --> 1:32:27.320
 So like, oh, all the smart, like famous people are on there.

1:32:27.320 --> 1:32:29.120
 I wonder what's, it's the FOMO,

1:32:29.120 --> 1:32:32.320
 like fear that you're missing something really profound

1:32:32.320 --> 1:32:34.280
 as exciting happening there.

1:32:34.280 --> 1:32:36.120
 So those social effects.

1:32:36.120 --> 1:32:37.880
 And then once they actually show up,

1:32:38.840 --> 1:32:40.200
 I'm a huge fan of this.

1:32:40.200 --> 1:32:42.240
 It's the JavaScript model is like,

1:32:42.240 --> 1:32:46.720
 clubhouse is so dumb, like so simple in its interface.

1:32:46.720 --> 1:32:50.480
 Like you literally can't do anything except mute, unmute.

1:32:50.480 --> 1:32:51.520
 There's a mute button.

1:32:51.520 --> 1:32:52.360
 Yeah.

1:32:52.360 --> 1:32:53.400
 And there's a leave quietly button.

1:32:53.400 --> 1:32:54.240
 Yeah.

1:32:54.240 --> 1:32:55.080
 And that's it.

1:32:55.080 --> 1:32:55.920
 Yeah.

1:32:55.920 --> 1:32:56.760
 And it's kinda.

1:32:56.760 --> 1:32:59.600
 I love single use technology that sense, yeah.

1:32:59.600 --> 1:33:02.360
 There's no like, there's no,

1:33:02.360 --> 1:33:04.800
 it's just like trivial.

1:33:04.800 --> 1:33:08.320
 And Twitter kinda started like that.

1:33:08.320 --> 1:33:10.080
 Facebook started like that.

1:33:10.080 --> 1:33:10.920
 Yeah.

1:33:10.920 --> 1:33:12.480
 But they've evolved quickly to add all these features

1:33:12.480 --> 1:33:13.440
 and so on.

1:33:13.440 --> 1:33:16.160
 And I do hope clubhouse stays that way.

1:33:16.160 --> 1:33:17.000
 Yeah.

1:33:17.000 --> 1:33:17.840
 It'd be interesting.

1:33:17.840 --> 1:33:18.680
 Or there's alternatives.

1:33:18.680 --> 1:33:21.120
 I mean, even with clubhouse though,

1:33:21.120 --> 1:33:23.040
 so one of the issues with a lot of these platforms

1:33:23.040 --> 1:33:26.760
 I think is bits are cheap enough now

1:33:27.840 --> 1:33:30.920
 that we don't really need a unicorn investor model.

1:33:30.920 --> 1:33:32.920
 I mean, the investors need that model.

1:33:32.920 --> 1:33:36.240
 There's really not really an imperative

1:33:36.240 --> 1:33:39.840
 of we need something that can scale

1:33:39.840 --> 1:33:42.160
 to a hundred million plus a year revenue.

1:33:42.160 --> 1:33:44.800
 So, because it was gonna require this much seed

1:33:44.800 --> 1:33:45.760
 and angel investment,

1:33:45.760 --> 1:33:48.400
 and you're not gonna get this much seed angel investment

1:33:48.400 --> 1:33:50.920
 unless you can have a potential exit this wide

1:33:50.920 --> 1:33:52.080
 because you have to be part of a portfolio

1:33:52.080 --> 1:33:55.040
 that depends on one out of 10 exiting here.

1:33:55.040 --> 1:33:57.400
 If you don't actually need that

1:33:57.400 --> 1:33:59.920
 and you don't need to satisfy that investor model,

1:33:59.920 --> 1:34:01.680
 which I think is basically the case.

1:34:01.680 --> 1:34:02.960
 I mean, bits are so cheap.

1:34:02.960 --> 1:34:04.320
 Everything is so cheap.

1:34:04.320 --> 1:34:07.600
 So even like with clubhouse, it's investor backed, right?

1:34:07.600 --> 1:34:10.680
 This notion of like, this needs to be a major platform,

1:34:11.840 --> 1:34:14.200
 but the bike club doesn't necessarily need a major platform.

1:34:14.200 --> 1:34:15.040
 That's where I'm interested.

1:34:15.040 --> 1:34:15.920
 I mean, I don't know.

1:34:15.920 --> 1:34:16.920
 There's so much money.

1:34:16.920 --> 1:34:18.360
 That's the only problem that bets against me

1:34:18.360 --> 1:34:21.520
 is that you can concentrate a lot of capital

1:34:21.520 --> 1:34:22.600
 if you do these things, right?

1:34:22.600 --> 1:34:23.920
 I mean, so Facebook was like

1:34:23.920 --> 1:34:26.280
 a fantastic capital concentration machine.

1:34:26.280 --> 1:34:28.040
 It's crazy how much,

1:34:28.040 --> 1:34:30.400
 where it even found that capital in the world

1:34:30.400 --> 1:34:32.600
 that it could concentrate and ossify in the stock price

1:34:32.600 --> 1:34:35.280
 that a very small number of people have access to, right?

1:34:35.280 --> 1:34:37.320
 That's incredibly powerful.

1:34:37.320 --> 1:34:40.760
 So when there is a possibility to consolidate

1:34:40.760 --> 1:34:42.040
 and gather a huge amount of capital,

1:34:42.040 --> 1:34:43.240
 that's a huge imperative

1:34:43.240 --> 1:34:45.920
 that's very hard for the bike club to go up against, so.

1:34:45.920 --> 1:34:47.400
 But there's a lot of money in the bike club.

1:34:47.400 --> 1:34:50.720
 If you see what the Wall Street bets

1:34:50.720 --> 1:34:53.120
 on that when a bunch of people get together,

1:34:53.120 --> 1:34:54.800
 I mean, it doesn't have to be a bike.

1:34:54.800 --> 1:34:56.200
 It could be a bunch of different bike clubs

1:34:56.200 --> 1:34:59.360
 just kind of team up to overtake.

1:34:59.360 --> 1:35:00.640
 That's what we're doing now, yeah.

1:35:00.640 --> 1:35:03.240
 Or we're gonna repurpose off the shelf stuff.

1:35:03.240 --> 1:35:05.640
 That's not, yeah, we're gonna repurpose

1:35:05.640 --> 1:35:07.760
 whatever it was for office productivity or something,

1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:09.600
 and like the clubs using Slack

1:35:09.600 --> 1:35:11.560
 just to build out these, you know.

1:35:11.560 --> 1:35:12.560
 Yeah.

1:35:12.560 --> 1:35:14.040
 Let's talk about email.

1:35:14.040 --> 1:35:15.760
 Yeah, that's right.

1:35:15.760 --> 1:35:16.600
 I wrote a book.

1:35:16.600 --> 1:35:20.880
 You wrote yet another amazing book,

1:35:20.880 --> 1:35:22.800
 A World Without Email.

1:35:22.800 --> 1:35:24.880
 Maybe one way to enter this discussion

1:35:24.880 --> 1:35:28.240
 is to ask what is the hyperactive hive mind,

1:35:28.240 --> 1:35:29.840
 which is the concept you opened the book with?

1:35:29.840 --> 1:35:31.240
 Yeah, and the devil.

1:35:31.240 --> 1:35:32.080
 And the devil.

1:35:32.080 --> 1:35:35.000
 It's the scourge of hundreds of millions.

1:35:35.880 --> 1:35:40.120
 So I think, so I called this book A World Without Email.

1:35:40.120 --> 1:35:41.400
 The real title should be A World

1:35:41.400 --> 1:35:43.880
 Without the Hyperactive Hive Mind Workflow,

1:35:43.880 --> 1:35:45.760
 but my publisher didn't like that, right?

1:35:45.760 --> 1:35:47.680
 So we had to get a little bit more pithy.

1:35:47.680 --> 1:35:50.520
 I was trying to answer the question after deep work,

1:35:50.520 --> 1:35:52.720
 why is it so hard to do this?

1:35:52.720 --> 1:35:54.160
 Like, if this is so valuable,

1:35:54.160 --> 1:35:55.600
 if we can produce much higher,

1:35:55.600 --> 1:35:56.880
 if people are much happier,

1:35:57.920 --> 1:35:58.960
 why do we check email a day?

1:35:58.960 --> 1:36:00.840
 Why are we on Slack all day?

1:36:00.840 --> 1:36:02.400
 And so I started working on this book

1:36:02.400 --> 1:36:04.240
 immediately after deep work.

1:36:04.240 --> 1:36:06.760
 And so my initial interviews were done in 2016.

1:36:06.760 --> 1:36:08.880
 So it took five years to pull the threads together.

1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:11.320
 I was trying to understand why is it so hard

1:36:11.320 --> 1:36:14.440
 for most people to actually find any time

1:36:14.440 --> 1:36:16.560
 to do the stuff that actually moves the needle?

1:36:16.560 --> 1:36:18.360
 And the story was, and I thought this was,

1:36:18.360 --> 1:36:20.000
 I hadn't heard this reported anywhere else.

1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.080
 That's why it took me so long to pull it together,

1:36:22.080 --> 1:36:24.440
 is email arrives on the scene,

1:36:24.440 --> 1:36:26.000
 email spreads, I trace it,

1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:28.640
 it really picks up steam in the early 1990s,

1:36:28.640 --> 1:36:32.320
 between like 1990 and 1995, it makes its move, right?

1:36:32.320 --> 1:36:34.080
 And it does so for very pragmatic reasons.

1:36:34.080 --> 1:36:36.840
 It was replacing existing communication technologies

1:36:36.840 --> 1:36:37.680
 that it was better than.

1:36:37.680 --> 1:36:39.960
 It was mainly the fax machine, voicemail, and memos, right?

1:36:39.960 --> 1:36:41.720
 So this was just better, right?

1:36:41.720 --> 1:36:44.360
 So it was a killer app because it was useful.

1:36:44.360 --> 1:36:47.840
 In its wake came a new way of collaborating,

1:36:47.840 --> 1:36:49.600
 and that's the Hyperactive Hive Mind.

1:36:49.600 --> 1:36:53.520
 So it's like the virus that follows the rats

1:36:53.520 --> 1:36:55.840
 that went through Western Europe for the Black Pig.

1:36:55.840 --> 1:36:57.920
 As email spread through organizations,

1:36:57.920 --> 1:37:00.560
 in its wake came the Hyperactive Hive Mind workflow,

1:37:00.560 --> 1:37:01.560
 which says, okay, guys,

1:37:01.560 --> 1:37:03.560
 here's the way we're gonna collaborate.

1:37:03.560 --> 1:37:05.400
 We'll just work things out on the fly

1:37:05.400 --> 1:37:07.360
 with unscheduled back and forth messages.

1:37:07.360 --> 1:37:09.040
 Just boom, boom, boom, let's go back and forth.

1:37:09.040 --> 1:37:09.880
 Hey, what about this?

1:37:09.880 --> 1:37:10.720
 Did you see this?

1:37:10.720 --> 1:37:11.560
 What about that client?

1:37:11.560 --> 1:37:13.200
 What's going on over here?

1:37:13.200 --> 1:37:14.840
 That followed email.

1:37:14.840 --> 1:37:18.200
 It completely took over office work.

1:37:18.200 --> 1:37:22.320
 And the need to keep up with all of these asynchronous

1:37:22.320 --> 1:37:24.400
 back and forth unscheduled messages,

1:37:24.400 --> 1:37:25.640
 as those got more and more and more,

1:37:25.640 --> 1:37:26.720
 and we had more of those to service,

1:37:26.720 --> 1:37:29.000
 the need to service those required us to check

1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:30.360
 more and more and more and more, right?

1:37:30.360 --> 1:37:32.040
 And so by the time, and I go through the numbers,

1:37:32.040 --> 1:37:34.000
 but by the time you get to today,

1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:34.960
 now the average knowledge worker

1:37:34.960 --> 1:37:37.480
 has to check one of these channels once every six minutes.

1:37:37.480 --> 1:37:39.720
 Because every single thing you do in your organization,

1:37:39.720 --> 1:37:40.680
 how you talk to your colleagues,

1:37:40.680 --> 1:37:41.600
 how you talk to your vendors,

1:37:41.600 --> 1:37:42.560
 how you talk to your clients,

1:37:42.560 --> 1:37:43.760
 how you talk to the HR department,

1:37:43.760 --> 1:37:45.400
 it's all this asynchronous unscheduled

1:37:45.400 --> 1:37:47.200
 back and forth messaging.

1:37:47.200 --> 1:37:49.560
 And you have to service the conversations.

1:37:49.560 --> 1:37:51.320
 And it spiraled out of control,

1:37:51.320 --> 1:37:54.200
 and it has sort of devolved a lot of work in the office now

1:37:54.200 --> 1:37:58.800
 to all I do is constantly tend communication channels.

1:37:58.800 --> 1:38:00.760
 So it's fascinating what you're describing

1:38:00.760 --> 1:38:05.760
 is nobody ever paused in this whole evolution

1:38:05.880 --> 1:38:08.760
 to try to create a system that actually works.

1:38:08.760 --> 1:38:13.080
 That it was kind of like a huge fan of cellular automata.

1:38:13.080 --> 1:38:17.440
 So it's just kind of started a very simple mechanism,

1:38:17.440 --> 1:38:18.520
 just like cellular automata.

1:38:18.520 --> 1:38:20.600
 It just kind of grew to overtake

1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:23.320
 all the fundamental communication

1:38:23.320 --> 1:38:25.400
 of how we do business and also personal life.

1:38:25.400 --> 1:38:27.240
 Yeah, and that's one of the big ideas

1:38:27.240 --> 1:38:29.800
 is that the unintentionality, right?

1:38:29.800 --> 1:38:31.920
 So this goes back to technological determinism.

1:38:31.920 --> 1:38:33.280
 I mean, this is a weird business book

1:38:33.280 --> 1:38:35.840
 because I go deep on philosophy.

1:38:35.840 --> 1:38:37.120
 I go deep on, for some reason,

1:38:37.120 --> 1:38:39.160
 we get into paleoanthropology for a while.

1:38:39.160 --> 1:38:40.320
 We do a lot of neuroscience.

1:38:40.320 --> 1:38:42.440
 It's kind of a weird book.

1:38:42.440 --> 1:38:44.800
 But I got real into this technological determinism, right?

1:38:44.800 --> 1:38:46.920
 This notion that just the presence of a technology

1:38:46.920 --> 1:38:48.720
 can change how people act.

1:38:48.720 --> 1:38:49.720
 That's my big argument

1:38:49.720 --> 1:38:51.080
 about what happened with the hive mind.

1:38:51.080 --> 1:38:54.280
 And I can document specific examples, right?

1:38:54.280 --> 1:38:59.280
 So I document this example in IBM, 1987, maybe 85,

1:38:59.960 --> 1:39:01.240
 but it's in like the mid to late eighties,

1:39:01.240 --> 1:39:03.600
 IBM, R. Monk headquarters.

1:39:03.600 --> 1:39:05.560
 We're gonna put an internal email, right?

1:39:05.560 --> 1:39:07.600
 Because it's convenient.

1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:09.360
 And so they ran a whole study.

1:39:09.360 --> 1:39:11.800
 And so I talked to the engineer who ran the study,

1:39:11.800 --> 1:39:13.120
 Adrian Stone, like we're gonna run this study

1:39:13.120 --> 1:39:14.800
 to figure out how much do we communicate

1:39:14.800 --> 1:39:17.800
 because it was still an era where it's expensive, right?

1:39:17.800 --> 1:39:19.160
 So you have to provision a mainframe.

1:39:19.160 --> 1:39:20.880
 So you can't over provision.

1:39:20.880 --> 1:39:22.840
 Like we wanna know how much communication actually happened.

1:39:22.840 --> 1:39:24.200
 So they went and figured it out.

1:39:24.200 --> 1:39:26.760
 How many memos, how many calls, how many notes, great.

1:39:26.760 --> 1:39:28.760
 We'll provision a mainframe to handle email

1:39:28.760 --> 1:39:29.960
 that can handle all of that.

1:39:29.960 --> 1:39:32.640
 So if all of our communication moves to email,

1:39:32.640 --> 1:39:34.200
 the mainframe will still be fine.

1:39:34.200 --> 1:39:36.040
 In three days, they had melted it down.

1:39:36.040 --> 1:39:39.480
 People were communicating six times more than that estimate.

1:39:39.480 --> 1:39:42.040
 So just in three days, the presence

1:39:42.040 --> 1:39:44.400
 of a low friction digital communication tool

1:39:44.400 --> 1:39:46.600
 drastically changed how everyone collaborated.

1:39:46.600 --> 1:39:49.560
 So that's not enough time for an all hands meeting.

1:39:49.560 --> 1:39:51.120
 Guys, we figured it out.

1:39:51.120 --> 1:39:52.760
 This is what we need to communicate a lot more

1:39:52.760 --> 1:39:54.960
 is what's gonna make us more productive.

1:39:54.960 --> 1:39:55.800
 We need more emails.

1:39:55.800 --> 1:39:56.640
 It's emergent.

1:39:57.560 --> 1:40:00.800
 Isn't that just on the positive end, amazing to you?

1:40:00.800 --> 1:40:03.240
 Like, isn't email amazing?

1:40:03.240 --> 1:40:04.680
 Like in those early days,

1:40:04.680 --> 1:40:07.200
 like just the frictionless communication.

1:40:07.200 --> 1:40:09.720
 I mean, email is awesome.

1:40:09.720 --> 1:40:13.560
 Like people say that there's a lot of problems with emails,

1:40:13.560 --> 1:40:15.080
 just like people say a lot of problems with Twitter

1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:15.920
 and so on.

1:40:15.920 --> 1:40:18.600
 It's kind of cool that you can just send a little note.

1:40:18.600 --> 1:40:20.000
 It was a miracle, right?

1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:23.880
 So I wrote a, there's originally was a New Yorker piece

1:40:23.880 --> 1:40:26.160
 from a year or two ago called, was email a mistake?

1:40:26.160 --> 1:40:28.160
 And then it's in the book too.

1:40:28.160 --> 1:40:31.280
 But I go into the history of email,

1:40:31.280 --> 1:40:32.800
 like why did it come along?

1:40:32.800 --> 1:40:34.480
 And it solved a huge problem.

1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:37.880
 It was the problem of fast asynchronous communication.

1:40:37.880 --> 1:40:39.360
 And it was a problem that did not exist

1:40:39.360 --> 1:40:41.040
 until we got large offices.

1:40:41.040 --> 1:40:43.400
 We got large offices, synchronous communication,

1:40:43.400 --> 1:40:44.800
 like let's get on the phone at the same time.

1:40:44.800 --> 1:40:45.840
 There's too much overhead to it.

1:40:45.840 --> 1:40:48.160
 There's too many people you might have to talk to.

1:40:48.160 --> 1:40:49.280
 Asynchronous communication,

1:40:49.280 --> 1:40:51.160
 like let me send you a memo when I'm ready

1:40:51.160 --> 1:40:53.800
 and you can read it when you're ready, took too long.

1:40:53.800 --> 1:40:55.000
 And so it was like a huge problem.

1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:56.760
 So one of the things I talked about is the way that

1:40:56.760 --> 1:40:58.960
 when they built the CIA headquarters,

1:40:58.960 --> 1:41:02.120
 there was such a need for fast asynchronous communication

1:41:02.120 --> 1:41:05.120
 that they built a pneumatic powered email system.

1:41:05.120 --> 1:41:06.440
 They had these pneumatic tubes

1:41:06.440 --> 1:41:07.720
 all throughout the headquarters

1:41:07.720 --> 1:41:09.680
 with electromagnetic routers.

1:41:09.680 --> 1:41:12.720
 So you would put your message in a plexiglass tube

1:41:12.720 --> 1:41:15.240
 and you would turn these brass dials about the location.

1:41:15.240 --> 1:41:17.280
 You would stick it in these things and pneumatic tubes

1:41:17.280 --> 1:41:18.840
 and it would shoot and sort

1:41:18.840 --> 1:41:20.520
 and work its way through these tubes

1:41:20.520 --> 1:41:23.800
 to show up in just a minute or something at the floor

1:41:23.800 --> 1:41:26.000
 and at the general office suite where you wanted to go.

1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:28.360
 And my point is the fact that they spent so much money

1:41:28.360 --> 1:41:29.240
 to make that work,

1:41:29.240 --> 1:41:32.320
 to show how important fast asynchronous communication

1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:33.160
 was to large offices.

1:41:33.160 --> 1:41:35.040
 So when email came along,

1:41:35.040 --> 1:41:37.080
 it was a productivity silver bullet.

1:41:37.080 --> 1:41:37.920
 It was a miracle.

1:41:37.920 --> 1:41:39.360
 I talked to the researchers who were working

1:41:39.360 --> 1:41:41.880
 on computer supported collaboration in the late 80s,

1:41:41.880 --> 1:41:43.360
 trying to figure out how are we gonna use

1:41:43.360 --> 1:41:45.000
 computer networks to be more productive?

1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:47.200
 And they were building all these systems and tools.

1:41:47.200 --> 1:41:48.280
 Email showed up,

1:41:48.280 --> 1:41:50.240
 it just wiped all that research off the map.

1:41:50.240 --> 1:41:51.480
 There was no need to build

1:41:51.480 --> 1:41:53.440
 these custom intranet applications.

1:41:53.440 --> 1:41:56.400
 There was no need to build these communication platforms.

1:41:56.400 --> 1:41:58.360
 Email could just do everything.

1:41:58.360 --> 1:42:00.880
 So it was a miracle application,

1:42:00.880 --> 1:42:02.800
 which is why it spread everywhere.

1:42:02.800 --> 1:42:04.120
 That's one of these things where,

1:42:04.120 --> 1:42:05.720
 okay, on into the consequences, right?

1:42:05.720 --> 1:42:07.760
 You had this miracle productivity silver bullet.

1:42:07.760 --> 1:42:09.240
 It spread everywhere,

1:42:09.240 --> 1:42:10.640
 but it was so effective.

1:42:10.640 --> 1:42:12.480
 It just, I don't know, like a drug.

1:42:12.480 --> 1:42:15.400
 I'm sure there's some pandemic metaphor here,

1:42:15.400 --> 1:42:17.600
 analogy here of a drug that like it's so effective

1:42:17.600 --> 1:42:19.080
 at treating this that it also blows up

1:42:19.080 --> 1:42:21.040
 your whole immune system and then everyone gets sick.

1:42:21.040 --> 1:42:23.520
 Well, ultimately it probably significantly increased

1:42:23.520 --> 1:42:24.720
 the productivity of the world,

1:42:24.720 --> 1:42:28.080
 but there's a kind of hump that it now has plateaued.

1:42:28.080 --> 1:42:32.160
 And then the fundamental question you're asking is like,

1:42:32.160 --> 1:42:33.720
 okay, how do we take the next,

1:42:33.720 --> 1:42:35.680
 how do we keep increasing the productivity?

1:42:35.680 --> 1:42:36.840
 Now, I think it brought it down.

1:42:36.840 --> 1:42:39.040
 So my contention,

1:42:39.040 --> 1:42:42.040
 and so again, there's a little bit in the book,

1:42:42.040 --> 1:42:44.080
 but I have a more recent Wired article

1:42:44.080 --> 1:42:47.000
 that puts some newer numbers to this.

1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:48.520
 I subscribed to the hypothesis

1:42:48.520 --> 1:42:51.520
 that the hyperactive hive mind was so detrimental.

1:42:51.520 --> 1:42:53.840
 So yeah, it helped productivity at first, right?

1:42:53.840 --> 1:42:56.480
 When you could do fast asynchronous communication,

1:42:56.480 --> 1:42:59.000
 but very quickly there was a sort of exponential rise

1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:01.000
 in communication amounts.

1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:02.680
 Once we got to the point where the hive mind meant

1:43:02.680 --> 1:43:04.440
 you had to constantly check your email,

1:43:04.440 --> 1:43:06.840
 I think that made us so unproductive

1:43:06.840 --> 1:43:08.240
 that it actually was pulling down

1:43:08.240 --> 1:43:09.400
 non industrial productivity.

1:43:09.400 --> 1:43:11.200
 And I think the only reason why,

1:43:11.200 --> 1:43:12.960
 so it certainly has not been going up.

1:43:12.960 --> 1:43:15.240
 That metric has been stagnating for a long time now

1:43:15.240 --> 1:43:16.920
 while all of this was going on.

1:43:16.920 --> 1:43:19.200
 I think the only reason why it hasn't fallen

1:43:19.200 --> 1:43:22.560
 is that we added these extra shifts off the books.

1:43:22.560 --> 1:43:23.880
 I'm gonna work for three hours in the morning,

1:43:23.880 --> 1:43:25.600
 I'm gonna work for three hours at night.

1:43:25.600 --> 1:43:27.480
 And only that I think has allowed us

1:43:27.480 --> 1:43:31.640
 to basically maintain a stagnated non industrial growth.

1:43:31.640 --> 1:43:33.000
 We should have been shooting up the charts.

1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:35.480
 I mean, this is miraculous innovations,

1:43:35.480 --> 1:43:36.320
 the computer networks.

1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:38.560
 And then we built out these hundred billion dollar

1:43:38.560 --> 1:43:41.360
 ubiquitous worldwide high speed wireless internet

1:43:41.360 --> 1:43:43.400
 infrastructure with supercomputers in our pockets

1:43:43.400 --> 1:43:44.840
 where we could talk to anyone at any time.

1:43:44.840 --> 1:43:47.320
 Like why did our productivity not shoot off the charts?

1:43:47.320 --> 1:43:48.640
 Because our brain can't context switch

1:43:48.640 --> 1:43:49.480
 once every six minutes.

1:43:49.480 --> 1:43:51.560
 So it's fundamentally back to the context switching.

1:43:51.560 --> 1:43:53.440
 Context switching is poison.

1:43:53.440 --> 1:43:54.760
 Context switching is poison.

1:43:54.760 --> 1:43:58.240
 What is it about email that forces context switching?

1:43:58.240 --> 1:44:00.640
 Is it both our psychology that drags us in?

1:44:00.640 --> 1:44:02.200
 Or is it the expectation?

1:44:02.200 --> 1:44:03.040
 Yeah, right, right.

1:44:03.040 --> 1:44:04.560
 Because it's not, I think we've seen this

1:44:04.560 --> 1:44:08.920
 through a personal will or failure lens recently.

1:44:08.920 --> 1:44:11.720
 Like, oh, am I addicted to email?

1:44:11.720 --> 1:44:14.000
 I have bad etiquette about my email.

1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:16.040
 No, it's the underlying workflow.

1:44:16.040 --> 1:44:19.360
 So the tool itself I will exonerate.

1:44:19.360 --> 1:44:23.600
 I think I would rather use POP3 than a fax protocol.

1:44:23.600 --> 1:44:24.960
 I think it's easier.

1:44:24.960 --> 1:44:27.000
 The issue is the hyperactive hive mind workflow.

1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:30.840
 So if I am now collaborating with 20 or 30 different people

1:44:30.840 --> 1:44:33.000
 with back and forth unscheduled messaging,

1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:35.160
 I have to tend those conversations, right?

1:44:35.160 --> 1:44:38.160
 It's like you have 30 metaphorical ping pong tables.

1:44:38.160 --> 1:44:39.360
 And when the balls come back across,

1:44:39.360 --> 1:44:41.200
 you have to pretty soon hit it back

1:44:41.200 --> 1:44:43.440
 or stuff actually grinds to a halt.

1:44:43.440 --> 1:44:45.560
 So it's the workflow that's the problem.

1:44:45.560 --> 1:44:47.080
 It's not the tools, the fact that we use it

1:44:47.080 --> 1:44:48.360
 to do all of our collaboration.

1:44:48.360 --> 1:44:49.840
 Let's just send messages back and forth,

1:44:49.840 --> 1:44:52.760
 which means you can't be far from checking that.

1:44:52.760 --> 1:44:54.800
 Cause if you take a break, if you batch,

1:44:54.800 --> 1:44:56.760
 if you try to have better habits,

1:44:56.760 --> 1:44:58.000
 it's gonna slow things down.

1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:02.400
 So my whole villain is this hyperactive hive mind workflow.

1:45:02.400 --> 1:45:03.560
 The tool is fine.

1:45:03.560 --> 1:45:05.320
 I don't want the tool to go away,

1:45:05.320 --> 1:45:07.200
 but I wanna replace the hyperactive hive mind workflow.

1:45:07.200 --> 1:45:10.040
 I think this is gonna be one of the biggest

1:45:10.040 --> 1:45:12.920
 value generating productivity revolutions

1:45:12.920 --> 1:45:14.160
 of the 21st century.

1:45:14.160 --> 1:45:16.920
 I quote an anonymous CEO who's pretty well known

1:45:16.920 --> 1:45:19.600
 who says this is gonna be the moonshot of the 21st century.

1:45:19.600 --> 1:45:20.960
 It's gonna be of that importance.

1:45:20.960 --> 1:45:24.400
 There's so much latent productivity that's being suppressed

1:45:24.400 --> 1:45:26.320
 because we just figure things out on the fly in email

1:45:26.320 --> 1:45:27.720
 that as we figure that out,

1:45:27.720 --> 1:45:32.040
 I think it's gonna be hundreds of billions of dollars.

1:45:32.040 --> 1:45:35.440
 You're so absolutely right.

1:45:35.440 --> 1:45:39.080
 The question is, what is a world without email look like?

1:45:39.080 --> 1:45:40.880
 How do we fix email?

1:45:40.880 --> 1:45:44.080
 So what happens is, at least in my vision,

1:45:44.080 --> 1:45:47.480
 you identify, well, actually there's these different

1:45:47.480 --> 1:45:49.200
 processes that make up my workday.

1:45:49.200 --> 1:45:52.000
 Like these are things that I do repeatedly,

1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:53.440
 often in collaboration with other people

1:45:53.440 --> 1:45:56.440
 that do useful things for my company or whatever.

1:45:56.440 --> 1:45:59.400
 Right now, most of these processes are implicitly implemented

1:45:59.400 --> 1:46:00.640
 with the hyperactive hive mind.

1:46:00.640 --> 1:46:01.560
 How do we do this thing?

1:46:01.560 --> 1:46:02.640
 Like answering client questions

1:46:02.640 --> 1:46:03.920
 to shoot messages back and forth.

1:46:03.920 --> 1:46:05.200
 How do we do this thing?

1:46:05.200 --> 1:46:06.280
 Posting podcast episodes,

1:46:06.280 --> 1:46:07.800
 we'll just figure it out on the fly.

1:46:07.800 --> 1:46:09.320
 My main argument is we actually have to do

1:46:09.320 --> 1:46:11.320
 like they did in the industrial sector,

1:46:11.320 --> 1:46:12.840
 take each of these processes and say,

1:46:12.840 --> 1:46:14.880
 is there a better way to do this?

1:46:14.880 --> 1:46:17.280
 And by better, I mean a way that's gonna minimize the need

1:46:17.280 --> 1:46:19.200
 to have unscheduled back and forth messaging.

1:46:19.200 --> 1:46:22.000
 So we actually have to do process engineering.

1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:24.280
 This created a massive growth and productivity

1:46:24.280 --> 1:46:25.880
 in the industrial sector during the 20th century.

1:46:25.880 --> 1:46:26.880
 We have to do it in knowledge work.

1:46:26.880 --> 1:46:28.440
 We can't just rock and roll an inbox

1:46:28.440 --> 1:46:30.080
 as we actually have to say,

1:46:30.080 --> 1:46:31.400
 how do we deal with client questions?

1:46:31.400 --> 1:46:32.600
 Well, let's put in place a process

1:46:32.600 --> 1:46:35.040
 that doesn't require us to send messages back and forth.

1:46:35.040 --> 1:46:36.560
 How do we post podcast episodes?

1:46:36.560 --> 1:46:38.520
 Let's automate this to a degree where

1:46:38.520 --> 1:46:40.360
 I don't have to just send you a message on the fly.

1:46:40.360 --> 1:46:43.200
 And you do this process by process

1:46:43.200 --> 1:46:45.160
 and the pressure on that inbox is released.

1:46:45.160 --> 1:46:46.960
 And now you don't have to check it every six minutes.

1:46:46.960 --> 1:46:47.920
 So you still have email.

1:46:47.920 --> 1:46:49.120
 I mean, like I need to send you a file.

1:46:49.120 --> 1:46:50.320
 Sure, I'll use email,

1:46:50.320 --> 1:46:52.680
 but we're not coordinating or collaborating over email

1:46:52.680 --> 1:46:55.000
 or Slack, which is just a faster way of doing the hive mind.

1:46:55.000 --> 1:46:57.840
 I mean, Slack doesn't solve anything there.

1:46:57.840 --> 1:47:00.240
 You have better structured bespoke processes.

1:47:00.240 --> 1:47:01.720
 I think that's what's gonna unleash

1:47:01.720 --> 1:47:03.160
 this massive productivity.

1:47:03.160 --> 1:47:05.640
 Bespoke, so the interesting thing is like,

1:47:05.640 --> 1:47:07.600
 for example, you and I exchange some emails.

1:47:07.600 --> 1:47:10.920
 So obviously I, let's just say in my particular case,

1:47:10.920 --> 1:47:11.920
 I schedule podcasts.

1:47:11.920 --> 1:47:13.920
 There's a bunch of different tasks,

1:47:13.920 --> 1:47:16.640
 fascinatingly enough, that I do

1:47:16.640 --> 1:47:18.360
 that can be converted into processes.

1:47:18.360 --> 1:47:19.200
 Yeah.

1:47:19.200 --> 1:47:21.800
 Is it up to me to create that process?

1:47:21.800 --> 1:47:23.720
 Or do you think we also need to build tools

1:47:23.720 --> 1:47:26.000
 just like email was a protocol

1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:31.000
 for helping us create processes for the different tasks?

1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:34.240
 I mean, I think ultimately the whole organization,

1:47:34.240 --> 1:47:35.400
 the whole team has to be involved.

1:47:35.400 --> 1:47:36.840
 I think ultimately there's certainly

1:47:36.840 --> 1:47:38.440
 a lot of investor money being spent right now

1:47:38.440 --> 1:47:40.440
 to try to figure out those tools, right?

1:47:40.440 --> 1:47:42.120
 So I think Silicon Valley has figured this out

1:47:42.120 --> 1:47:43.160
 in the past couple of years.

1:47:43.160 --> 1:47:45.080
 This is the difference between

1:47:45.080 --> 1:47:47.240
 when I was talking to people after Deep Work

1:47:47.240 --> 1:47:51.680
 and now five years later is this scent is in the air, right?

1:47:51.680 --> 1:47:53.280
 Because there's so much latent productivity.

1:47:53.280 --> 1:47:54.880
 So yes, there are gonna be new tools,

1:47:54.880 --> 1:47:55.720
 which I think could help.

1:47:55.720 --> 1:47:57.040
 There are already tools that exist.

1:47:57.040 --> 1:48:00.120
 I mean, in the different groups I profiled use things

1:48:00.120 --> 1:48:03.760
 like Trello or Basecamp or Asana or Flow

1:48:03.760 --> 1:48:06.080
 and our schedule wants and acuity,

1:48:06.080 --> 1:48:08.760
 like there's a lot of tools out there.

1:48:08.760 --> 1:48:10.720
 The key is not to think about it in terms of

1:48:10.720 --> 1:48:12.520
 what tool do I replace email with?

1:48:12.520 --> 1:48:14.360
 Instead, you think about it with,

1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:16.240
 we're trying to come up with a process

1:48:16.240 --> 1:48:17.680
 that reduces back and forth messages.

1:48:17.680 --> 1:48:21.360
 Oh, what tool might help us do that?

1:48:21.360 --> 1:48:22.320
 Yeah, and I would push,

1:48:22.320 --> 1:48:24.080
 it's not about necessarily efficiency.

1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:26.120
 In fact, some of these things are gonna take more time.

1:48:26.120 --> 1:48:29.840
 So writing a letter to someone is like a high value activity

1:48:29.840 --> 1:48:31.040
 it's probably worth doing.

1:48:31.040 --> 1:48:33.520
 The thing that's killer is the back and forth

1:48:33.520 --> 1:48:35.200
 because now I have to keep checking, right?

1:48:35.200 --> 1:48:36.800
 So we scheduled this together

1:48:36.800 --> 1:48:38.600
 because I knew you from before,

1:48:38.600 --> 1:48:41.560
 but like most of the interviews I was scheduling for this

1:48:41.560 --> 1:48:43.840
 actually I have a process with my publicist

1:48:43.840 --> 1:48:46.480
 where we use a shared document and she puts stuffs in there

1:48:46.480 --> 1:48:48.120
 and then I check it twice a week

1:48:48.120 --> 1:48:50.120
 and there's scheduling options.

1:48:50.120 --> 1:48:51.240
 I say, here's when I wanna do this one

1:48:51.240 --> 1:48:52.720
 or this will work for this one or whatever.

1:48:52.720 --> 1:48:55.000
 And it takes more time in the moment than just,

1:48:55.000 --> 1:48:58.520
 but it means that we have almost no back and forth messaging

1:48:58.520 --> 1:49:00.560
 for podcast scheduling, which without this,

1:49:00.560 --> 1:49:02.520
 so like with my UK publisher,

1:49:02.520 --> 1:49:03.920
 I didn't put this process in the place

1:49:03.920 --> 1:49:06.480
 because we're not doing as many interviews,

1:49:06.480 --> 1:49:07.440
 but it's all the time.

1:49:07.440 --> 1:49:10.120
 And I'm like, oh, I could really feel the difference, right?

1:49:10.120 --> 1:49:11.760
 It's the back and forth that's killer.

1:49:11.760 --> 1:49:15.080
 I suppose it is up to the individual people involved,

1:49:15.080 --> 1:49:18.120
 like you said, knowledge workers,

1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:21.040
 like they have to carry the responsibility

1:49:21.040 --> 1:49:23.560
 of creating processes.

1:49:23.560 --> 1:49:25.960
 Like how always asking the first principles question,

1:49:25.960 --> 1:49:28.280
 how can this be converted into a process?

1:49:28.280 --> 1:49:30.680
 Yeah, so you can start by doing this yourself,

1:49:30.680 --> 1:49:32.680
 like just with what you can control.

1:49:32.680 --> 1:49:34.960
 I think ultimately once the teams are doing that,

1:49:34.960 --> 1:49:36.440
 I think that's probably the right scale.

1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:38.200
 If you try to do this at the organizational scale,

1:49:38.200 --> 1:49:39.880
 you're gonna get bureaucracy, right?

1:49:39.880 --> 1:49:44.680
 So if it's, if Elon Musk is gonna dictate down

1:49:44.680 --> 1:49:46.960
 to everyone at Tesla or something like this,

1:49:46.960 --> 1:49:48.680
 that's too much remove and you get bureaucracy.

1:49:48.680 --> 1:49:52.200
 But if it's, we're a team of six that's working together

1:49:52.200 --> 1:49:55.200
 on whatever powertrain software,

1:49:55.200 --> 1:49:57.240
 then we can figure out on our own, what are our processes?

1:49:57.240 --> 1:49:58.200
 How do we wanna do this?

1:49:58.200 --> 1:50:00.040
 So it's ultimately also creating a culture

1:50:00.040 --> 1:50:03.080
 where saying like an email, sending an email

1:50:03.080 --> 1:50:05.600
 just for the hell of it, it should be taboo.

1:50:05.600 --> 1:50:09.920
 So you are being, you're being destructive

1:50:09.920 --> 1:50:12.560
 to the productivity of the team by sending this email.

1:50:12.560 --> 1:50:17.480
 As opposed to helping develop a process and so on

1:50:17.480 --> 1:50:20.760
 that will ultimately automate this.

1:50:20.760 --> 1:50:22.480
 That's why I'm trying to spread this message

1:50:22.480 --> 1:50:24.160
 of the context switches as poison.

1:50:24.160 --> 1:50:25.440
 I get so much into the science of it.

1:50:25.440 --> 1:50:28.000
 I think we underestimate how much it kills us

1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:29.640
 to have to wrench away our context,

1:50:29.640 --> 1:50:30.800
 look at a message and come back.

1:50:30.800 --> 1:50:32.840
 And so once you have the mindset of,

1:50:32.840 --> 1:50:35.160
 it's a huge thing to ask of someone

1:50:35.160 --> 1:50:37.080
 to have to take their attention off something

1:50:37.080 --> 1:50:38.160
 and look back at this.

1:50:38.160 --> 1:50:40.400
 And if they have to do that for three or four times,

1:50:40.400 --> 1:50:42.160
 like we're just gonna figure this out on the fly

1:50:42.160 --> 1:50:44.040
 and every message is gonna require five checks

1:50:44.040 --> 1:50:45.520
 of the inbox while you wait for it.

1:50:45.520 --> 1:50:47.680
 Now you've created whatever it is at this point,

1:50:47.680 --> 1:50:50.240
 25 or 30 context shifts.

1:50:50.240 --> 1:50:52.840
 Like you've just done a huge disservice to someone's day.

1:50:52.840 --> 1:50:54.640
 This would be like, if I had a professional athlete,

1:50:54.640 --> 1:50:55.920
 like, hey, do me a favor.

1:50:55.920 --> 1:50:57.080
 I need you to go do this press interview,

1:50:57.080 --> 1:50:59.600
 but to get there, you're gonna have to carry this sandbag

1:50:59.600 --> 1:51:01.600
 and sprint up this hill, like completely exhaust

1:51:01.600 --> 1:51:03.160
 your muscles and then you have to go play a game.

1:51:03.160 --> 1:51:04.680
 Like, of course I'm not gonna ask an athlete

1:51:04.680 --> 1:51:07.320
 to do like an incredibly physically demanding thing

1:51:07.320 --> 1:51:08.640
 right before a game,

1:51:08.640 --> 1:51:11.760
 but something as easy as thoughts, question mark,

1:51:11.760 --> 1:51:13.280
 or like, hey, do you wanna jump on a call

1:51:13.280 --> 1:51:14.920
 and it's gonna be six back and forth messages

1:51:14.920 --> 1:51:15.800
 to figure it out.

1:51:15.800 --> 1:51:17.760
 It's kind of the cognitive equivalent, right?

1:51:17.760 --> 1:51:19.600
 You're taking the wind out of someone.

1:51:19.600 --> 1:51:22.480
 Yeah, and by the way, for people who are listening,

1:51:22.480 --> 1:51:24.680
 because I recently posted a few job openings

1:51:24.680 --> 1:51:26.480
 for us so I wanted to help with this thing.

1:51:26.480 --> 1:51:28.880
 And one of the things that people are surprised

1:51:28.880 --> 1:51:30.760
 when they work with me is how many spreadsheets

1:51:30.760 --> 1:51:32.160
 and processes are involved.

1:51:32.160 --> 1:51:33.480
 Yeah, it's like Claude Shannon, right?

1:51:33.480 --> 1:51:36.360
 I talked about communication theory or information theory.

1:51:36.360 --> 1:51:38.720
 It takes time to come up with a clever code upfront.

1:51:38.720 --> 1:51:40.240
 So you spend more time upfront figuring out those

1:51:40.240 --> 1:51:42.880
 spreadsheets and trying to get people on board with it.

1:51:42.880 --> 1:51:45.320
 But then your communication going forward

1:51:45.320 --> 1:51:46.280
 is all much more efficient.

1:51:46.280 --> 1:51:49.760
 So over time, you're using much less bandwidth, right?

1:51:49.760 --> 1:51:52.320
 So you do pain upfront.

1:51:52.320 --> 1:51:54.680
 It's quicker just right now to send an email.

1:51:54.680 --> 1:51:56.160
 But if I spend a half day to do this

1:51:56.160 --> 1:52:00.200
 over the next six months, I've saved myself 600 emails.

1:52:00.200 --> 1:52:02.640
 Now, here's a tough question for, you know,

1:52:02.640 --> 1:52:04.640
 from the computer science perspective,

1:52:04.640 --> 1:52:07.080
 we often over optimize.

1:52:07.080 --> 1:52:10.920
 So you've create processes and you, okay,

1:52:10.920 --> 1:52:14.880
 just like you're saying, it's so pleasurable

1:52:14.880 --> 1:52:19.720
 to increase in the longterm productivity

1:52:19.720 --> 1:52:22.880
 that sometimes you just enjoy that process in itself

1:52:22.880 --> 1:52:27.280
 by just creating processes and you actually never,

1:52:28.440 --> 1:52:31.080
 like it has a negative effect on productivity longterm

1:52:31.080 --> 1:52:33.560
 because you're too obsessed with the processes.

1:52:33.560 --> 1:52:37.920
 Is that a nice problem to have essentially?

1:52:37.920 --> 1:52:38.920
 I mean, it's a problem.

1:52:38.920 --> 1:52:41.240
 I mean, because let's look at the one sector

1:52:41.240 --> 1:52:44.560
 that does do this, which is developers, right?

1:52:44.560 --> 1:52:47.240
 So agile methodologies like Scrum or Kanban

1:52:47.240 --> 1:52:49.880
 are basically workflow methodologies

1:52:49.880 --> 1:52:52.400
 that are much better than the hyperactive hive mind.

1:52:52.400 --> 1:52:55.800
 But man, some of those programmers get pretty obsessive.

1:52:55.800 --> 1:52:57.600
 I don't know if you've ever talked to a whatever

1:52:57.600 --> 1:52:59.520
 level three Scrum master.

1:52:59.520 --> 1:53:02.040
 They get really obsessive about like,

1:53:02.040 --> 1:53:04.280
 it has to happen exactly this way

1:53:04.280 --> 1:53:06.000
 and it's probably seven times more complex

1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:07.360
 than it needs to be.

1:53:07.360 --> 1:53:09.840
 I'm hoping that's just because nerds like me,

1:53:09.840 --> 1:53:11.080
 you know, like to do that,

1:53:11.080 --> 1:53:14.280
 but it's a broadly probably an issue, right?

1:53:14.280 --> 1:53:16.120
 We have to be careful because you can just go down

1:53:16.120 --> 1:53:18.000
 that fiddling path.

1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:19.840
 Like, so it needs to be, here's how we do it.

1:53:19.840 --> 1:53:22.640
 Let's reduce the messages and let's roll, you know?

1:53:22.640 --> 1:53:26.200
 You can't save yourself through,

1:53:26.200 --> 1:53:28.280
 if you can get the process just right, right?

1:53:28.280 --> 1:53:30.600
 So I wrote this article kind of recently

1:53:30.600 --> 1:53:32.800
 called The Rise and Fall of Getting Things Done.

1:53:32.800 --> 1:53:37.080
 And I profiled this productivity guru named Merlin Mann.

1:53:37.080 --> 1:53:39.960
 And I talked about this movement called Productivity Prawn

1:53:39.960 --> 1:53:42.920
 as like elite speak term in the early 2000s

1:53:42.920 --> 1:53:44.520
 where people just became convinced

1:53:44.520 --> 1:53:47.160
 that if they could combine their productivity systems

1:53:47.160 --> 1:53:50.200
 with software and they could find just the right software,

1:53:50.200 --> 1:53:51.920
 just the right configuration where they could offload

1:53:51.920 --> 1:53:53.080
 most of the difficulty of work,

1:53:53.080 --> 1:53:54.680
 what happened with the machines,

1:53:54.680 --> 1:53:55.520
 when it kind of figured out for,

1:53:55.520 --> 1:53:57.480
 and then they could just sort of crank widgets and it'd be,

1:53:57.480 --> 1:53:58.680
 and the whole thing fell apart

1:53:58.680 --> 1:54:00.880
 because work is hard and it's hard to do

1:54:00.880 --> 1:54:03.080
 and making decisions about what to work on is hard

1:54:03.080 --> 1:54:04.760
 and no system can really do that for you.

1:54:04.760 --> 1:54:08.880
 So you have to have this sort of balance between,

1:54:09.840 --> 1:54:10.920
 context switches are poison.

1:54:10.920 --> 1:54:12.480
 So we got to get rid of the context switches.

1:54:12.480 --> 1:54:13.920
 Once like something's working good enough

1:54:13.920 --> 1:54:17.120
 to get rid of the context switches, then get after it.

1:54:17.120 --> 1:54:19.520
 Yeah, there's a psychological process there for me.

1:54:19.520 --> 1:54:22.600
 The OCD nature, like I've literally,

1:54:22.600 --> 1:54:26.280
 embarrassing enough, have lost my shit before when,

1:54:26.280 --> 1:54:30.440
 so in many of the processes that involve Python scripts,

1:54:30.440 --> 1:54:34.920
 the rule is to not use spaces.

1:54:34.920 --> 1:54:36.600
 Underscores, there's like rules

1:54:36.600 --> 1:54:39.320
 for like how you format stuff, okay?

1:54:39.320 --> 1:54:42.160
 And like, I should not lose my shit

1:54:42.160 --> 1:54:45.360
 when somebody had a space and maybe capital letters,

1:54:45.360 --> 1:54:48.080
 like it's okay to have a space

1:54:48.080 --> 1:54:51.800
 because there's this feeling like something's not perfect.

1:54:51.800 --> 1:54:54.640
 And as opposed to in the Python script,

1:54:54.640 --> 1:54:56.680
 allowing some flexibility around that,

1:54:56.680 --> 1:54:59.120
 you create this programmatic way that's flawless

1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:01.760
 and when everything's working perfectly, it's perfect.

1:55:01.760 --> 1:55:06.120
 But actually, if you strive for perfection,

1:55:06.120 --> 1:55:10.160
 it has the same stress, like has a lot of the stress

1:55:10.160 --> 1:55:12.960
 that you were seeking to escape with the context switching

1:55:12.960 --> 1:55:17.960
 because you're almost stressing about errors.

1:55:18.120 --> 1:55:20.880
 Like when the process is functioning,

1:55:20.880 --> 1:55:23.200
 there's always this anxiety of like,

1:55:23.200 --> 1:55:25.480
 I wonder if it's gonna succeed.

1:55:25.480 --> 1:55:26.840
 I wonder if it's gonna succeed.

1:55:26.840 --> 1:55:29.080
 Yeah, no, no, I think some of that's just you and I probably.

1:55:29.080 --> 1:55:30.320
 I mean, it's just our mindset, right?

1:55:30.320 --> 1:55:32.360
 We're in, we do computer science, right?

1:55:32.360 --> 1:55:34.520
 So chicken and egg, I guess.

1:55:34.520 --> 1:55:37.840
 And a lot of the processes end up working here much rougher.

1:55:37.840 --> 1:55:39.480
 It's like, okay, instead of letting clients

1:55:39.480 --> 1:55:43.760
 just email me all the time, we have a weekly call

1:55:43.760 --> 1:55:45.440
 and then we send them a breakdown

1:55:45.440 --> 1:55:47.640
 of everything we committed to, right?

1:55:47.640 --> 1:55:48.560
 That's a process that works.

1:55:48.560 --> 1:55:50.120
 Okay, I get asked a lot of questions

1:55:50.120 --> 1:55:51.960
 because I'm the JavaScript guy in the company.

1:55:51.960 --> 1:55:53.800
 Instead of doing it by email, I have office hours.

1:55:53.800 --> 1:55:54.880
 This is what Basecamp does.

1:55:54.880 --> 1:55:55.960
 All right, so you come to my office hours,

1:55:55.960 --> 1:55:57.160
 that cuts down a lot of back and forth.

1:55:57.160 --> 1:55:58.320
 All right, we're gonna, instead of emailing

1:55:58.320 --> 1:56:02.040
 about this project, we'll have a Trello board

1:56:02.040 --> 1:56:04.680
 and we'll do a weekly really structured status meeting

1:56:04.680 --> 1:56:07.040
 real quick, what's going on, who needs what, let's go.

1:56:07.040 --> 1:56:09.080
 And now everything's on there and on our inboxes,

1:56:09.080 --> 1:56:10.160
 we don't have to send as many messages.

1:56:10.160 --> 1:56:12.440
 So like that rough level of granularity,

1:56:12.440 --> 1:56:14.520
 that gets you most of the way there.

1:56:14.520 --> 1:56:17.120
 So the parts that you can't automate

1:56:17.120 --> 1:56:18.680
 and turn into a process.

1:56:18.680 --> 1:56:21.800
 So how many parts like that do you think

1:56:21.800 --> 1:56:24.680
 should remain in a perfect world?

1:56:24.680 --> 1:56:29.680
 And for those parts where email is still useful,

1:56:29.920 --> 1:56:32.640
 what do you recommend those emails look like?

1:56:32.640 --> 1:56:34.400
 How should you write emails?

1:56:34.400 --> 1:56:35.840
 When should you send them?

1:56:35.840 --> 1:56:40.760
 Yeah, I think email is good for delivering information.

1:56:40.760 --> 1:56:43.360
 Right, so I think of it like a fax machine or something.

1:56:43.360 --> 1:56:44.360
 It's a really good fax machine.

1:56:44.360 --> 1:56:46.280
 So if I need to send you something

1:56:46.280 --> 1:56:47.120
 and you just send you a file,

1:56:47.120 --> 1:56:49.480
 I need to broadcast a new policy or something,

1:56:49.480 --> 1:56:51.320
 like email is a great way to do it.

1:56:51.320 --> 1:56:53.640
 It's bad for collaboration.

1:56:53.640 --> 1:56:55.640
 So if you're having a conversation,

1:56:55.640 --> 1:56:57.480
 like we're trying to reach a decision on something,

1:56:57.480 --> 1:56:58.840
 I'm trying to learn about something,

1:56:58.840 --> 1:57:01.440
 I'm trying to clarify what this is,

1:57:01.440 --> 1:57:04.800
 that's more than just like a one answer type question,

1:57:04.800 --> 1:57:07.480
 then I think that you shouldn't be doing an email.

1:57:07.480 --> 1:57:08.960
 But see, here's the thing.

1:57:08.960 --> 1:57:11.600
 Like you and I don't talk often

1:57:11.600 --> 1:57:13.840
 and so we have a kind of new interaction.

1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:17.520
 It's not, so sure, yeah, you have a book coming out,

1:57:17.520 --> 1:57:19.040
 so there's a process and so on,

1:57:19.040 --> 1:57:22.000
 but say there, don't you think there's a lot

1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:24.280
 of novel interactive experiences?

1:57:24.280 --> 1:57:25.320
 Yeah, I think it's fine.

1:57:25.320 --> 1:57:27.800
 So you could, just for every novel experience,

1:57:27.800 --> 1:57:29.960
 it's okay to have a little bit of exchange.

1:57:29.960 --> 1:57:30.800
 Yeah, I think it's fine.

1:57:30.800 --> 1:57:33.080
 Like I think it's fine if stuff comes in over the transom

1:57:33.080 --> 1:57:36.000
 or you hear from someone you haven't heard from in a while.

1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:37.440
 I think all that's fine.

1:57:37.440 --> 1:57:39.680
 I mean, that's email at its best.

1:57:39.680 --> 1:57:41.720
 Where it starts to kill us is where all

1:57:41.720 --> 1:57:43.440
 of our collaboration is happening with the back and forth.

1:57:43.440 --> 1:57:45.680
 So when you've moved the bulk of that out of your inbox,

1:57:45.680 --> 1:57:48.880
 now you're back in that Meg Ryan movie, like You Got Mail,

1:57:48.880 --> 1:57:50.880
 where it's like, all right, load this up

1:57:50.880 --> 1:57:51.760
 and you wait for the boat and be like,

1:57:51.760 --> 1:57:53.120
 oh, we got a message.

1:57:53.120 --> 1:57:54.720
 Yeah, Lex sent me a message.

1:57:54.720 --> 1:57:55.560
 This is interesting, right?

1:57:55.560 --> 1:57:56.920
 You're back to the AOL days.

1:57:56.920 --> 1:58:00.040
 So you're talking about the bulk of the business world

1:58:00.040 --> 1:58:04.040
 where email has replaced the actual communication,

1:58:04.040 --> 1:58:05.920
 all of the communication protocols required

1:58:05.920 --> 1:58:06.760
 to accomplish anything.

1:58:06.760 --> 1:58:08.040
 Everything is just happening with messages.

1:58:08.040 --> 1:58:11.000
 So if you now get most stuff done,

1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:14.040
 repeatable collaborations with other processes

1:58:14.040 --> 1:58:15.600
 that don't require you to check these inboxes,

1:58:15.600 --> 1:58:17.880
 then the inbox can serve like an inbox,

1:58:17.880 --> 1:58:20.840
 which includes hearing from interesting people, right?

1:58:20.840 --> 1:58:22.640
 Or sending something, hey, I don't know if you saw this,

1:58:22.640 --> 1:58:23.480
 I thought you might like it.

1:58:23.480 --> 1:58:24.720
 I think it's great for that.

1:58:24.720 --> 1:58:27.560
 So there's probably a bunch of people listening to this.

1:58:27.560 --> 1:58:31.080
 They're like, yeah, but I work on a team

1:58:31.080 --> 1:58:33.080
 and all they use is email.

1:58:33.080 --> 1:58:35.880
 How do you start the revolution from the ground up?

1:58:35.880 --> 1:58:39.000
 Yeah, well, do asymmetric optimization first.

1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:40.680
 So identify all your processes

1:58:40.680 --> 1:58:42.360
 and then change what you can change

1:58:42.360 --> 1:58:44.360
 and be socially very careful about it.

1:58:44.360 --> 1:58:46.280
 So don't necessarily say like, okay,

1:58:46.280 --> 1:58:48.280
 this is a new process we all have to do.

1:58:48.280 --> 1:58:51.840
 You're just, hey, we gotta get this report ready.

1:58:51.840 --> 1:58:52.880
 Here's what I think we should do.

1:58:52.880 --> 1:58:54.680
 I'll get a draft into our Dropbox folder

1:58:54.680 --> 1:58:57.920
 by noon on Monday, grab it.

1:58:57.920 --> 1:59:00.160
 I won't touch it again until Tuesday morning

1:59:00.160 --> 1:59:01.600
 and then I'll look at your changes.

1:59:01.600 --> 1:59:03.880
 I have this office hours always scheduled Tuesday afternoon.

1:59:03.880 --> 1:59:05.800
 So if there's anything that catches your attention,

1:59:05.800 --> 1:59:07.000
 grab me then.

1:59:07.000 --> 1:59:09.240
 But I've told the designer who CC'd on this

1:59:09.240 --> 1:59:13.080
 that by COB Tuesday, the final version will be ready

1:59:13.080 --> 1:59:14.920
 for them to take and polish or whatever.

1:59:14.920 --> 1:59:16.160
 Like the person on the other end is like, great,

1:59:16.160 --> 1:59:18.160
 I'm glad Cal has a plan.

1:59:18.160 --> 1:59:19.280
 So what do I need to do?

1:59:19.280 --> 1:59:21.300
 I need to edit this tomorrow, whatever, right?

1:59:21.300 --> 1:59:22.760
 But you've actually pulled them into a process.

1:59:22.760 --> 1:59:24.260
 That means we're gonna get this report together

1:59:24.260 --> 1:59:25.920
 without having to just go back and forth.

1:59:25.920 --> 1:59:29.240
 So you just asymmetrically optimize these things

1:59:29.240 --> 1:59:31.400
 and then you can begin the conversation.

1:59:31.400 --> 1:59:32.960
 And maybe that's where my book comes in place.

1:59:32.960 --> 1:59:36.440
 You just sort of slide it across the desk.

1:59:36.440 --> 1:59:39.320
 Buy the book and just leave it, give it to everybody

1:59:39.320 --> 1:59:40.240
 on your team.

1:59:40.240 --> 1:59:42.920
 Okay, so we solved the bulk of the email problem with this.

1:59:42.920 --> 1:59:45.480
 Is there a case to be made that even for communication

1:59:45.480 --> 1:59:50.480
 between you and I, we should move away from email?

1:59:50.720 --> 1:59:52.480
 And for example, there's a guy, I recently,

1:59:52.480 --> 1:59:53.680
 I don't know if you know comedians,

1:59:53.680 --> 1:59:55.920
 but there's a guy named Joey Diaz

1:59:55.920 --> 1:59:57.840
 that I've had an interaction with recently.

1:59:57.840 --> 2:00:00.400
 And that guy, first of all, the sweetest human,

2:00:00.400 --> 2:00:02.480
 despite what his comedy sounds like,

2:00:02.480 --> 2:00:04.280
 is the sweetest human being.

2:00:04.280 --> 2:00:08.560
 And he's a big proponent of just pick up the phone and call.

2:00:08.560 --> 2:00:11.040
 And it makes me so uncomfortable when people call me.

2:00:11.040 --> 2:00:14.040
 It's like, I don't know what to do with this thing.

2:00:14.040 --> 2:00:17.720
 But it kind of gets everything done quicker, I think,

2:00:17.720 --> 2:00:19.880
 if I remove the anxiety from that.

2:00:19.880 --> 2:00:21.200
 Is there a case to be made for that?

2:00:21.200 --> 2:00:24.240
 Or is email could still be the most efficient way

2:00:24.240 --> 2:00:25.080
 to do this?

2:00:25.080 --> 2:00:27.600
 No, look, if you have to interact with someone,

2:00:27.600 --> 2:00:30.000
 there's a lot of efficiency and synchrony, right?

2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:31.760
 And this is something from distributed system theory

2:00:31.760 --> 2:00:33.360
 where you know if you go from synchronous

2:00:33.360 --> 2:00:34.720
 to asynchronous networks,

2:00:34.720 --> 2:00:36.600
 there's a huge amount of overhead to the asynchrony.

2:00:36.600 --> 2:00:39.000
 So actually the protocols required to solve things

2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:42.120
 in asynchronous networks are significantly more complicated

2:00:42.120 --> 2:00:44.000
 and fragile than synchronous protocols.

2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:46.960
 So if we can just do real time, it's usually better.

2:00:46.960 --> 2:00:48.560
 And also from an interaction,

2:00:48.560 --> 2:00:49.960
 like social connection standpoint,

2:00:49.960 --> 2:00:51.840
 there's a lot more information in the human voice

2:00:51.840 --> 2:00:53.760
 and the back and forth.

2:00:53.760 --> 2:00:56.840
 Yeah, if you just call, so very generational, right?

2:00:56.840 --> 2:00:59.400
 Our generation will be comfortable talking on the phone

2:00:59.400 --> 2:01:01.400
 in a way that a younger generation isn't,

2:01:01.400 --> 2:01:03.080
 but an older generation is more comfortable

2:01:03.080 --> 2:01:05.080
 with, well, you just call people.

2:01:05.080 --> 2:01:07.000
 Whereas we, so there's a happy medium,

2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:09.200
 but most of my good friends, we just talk,

2:01:09.200 --> 2:01:11.000
 we have regular phone calls.

2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:11.840
 Okay.

2:01:11.840 --> 2:01:13.000
 Yeah, it's not, I don't just call them,

2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:14.440
 we schedule it, we schedule it, yeah.

2:01:14.440 --> 2:01:17.920
 Just on text, like, yeah, you wanna talk sometime soon.

2:01:17.920 --> 2:01:20.800
 Do you ever have a process around friends?

2:01:20.800 --> 2:01:22.240
 Not really, no.

2:01:22.240 --> 2:01:24.360
 I feel like I should, I feel like.

2:01:24.360 --> 2:01:25.200
 Well, you have like a lot

2:01:25.200 --> 2:01:27.640
 of interesting friend possibilities.

2:01:27.640 --> 2:01:29.120
 You have like an interesting problem, right?

2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:32.080
 Like really interesting people you can talk to.

2:01:32.080 --> 2:01:33.360
 Well, that's one problem.

2:01:33.360 --> 2:01:34.720
 The other one is the introversion

2:01:34.720 --> 2:01:37.640
 where I'm just afraid of people and get really stressed.

2:01:37.640 --> 2:01:38.760
 Like I freak out.

2:01:38.760 --> 2:01:39.600
 And so.

2:01:39.600 --> 2:01:41.400
 You picked a good line of work.

2:01:41.400 --> 2:01:43.960
 Yeah, now perhaps it's the Goggins thing.

2:01:43.960 --> 2:01:46.520
 It's like facing your fears or whatever,

2:01:46.520 --> 2:01:50.440
 but it's almost like there's,

2:01:50.440 --> 2:01:52.960
 it has to do with the timetables thing and the deep work

2:01:52.960 --> 2:01:55.760
 that the nice thing about the processes

2:01:55.760 --> 2:02:00.760
 is it not only automates sort of,

2:02:00.760 --> 2:02:03.160
 automates away the context switching,

2:02:03.160 --> 2:02:06.200
 it ensures you do the important things too.

2:02:06.200 --> 2:02:07.440
 It's like prioritize.

2:02:07.440 --> 2:02:09.920
 So the thing is with email,

2:02:09.920 --> 2:02:12.280
 because everything is done over email,

2:02:13.280 --> 2:02:17.000
 you can be lazy in the same way with like social networks

2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:20.800
 and do the easy things first that are not that important.

2:02:20.800 --> 2:02:23.000
 So the process also enforces

2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:24.600
 that you do the important things.

2:02:24.600 --> 2:02:27.920
 And for me, the important things is like,

2:02:27.920 --> 2:02:30.120
 okay, that sounds weird, but like social connection.

2:02:30.120 --> 2:02:32.760
 No, that's one of the most important things

2:02:32.760 --> 2:02:34.840
 in all of human existence.

2:02:34.840 --> 2:02:37.400
 And doing it, the paradoxical thing,

2:02:37.400 --> 2:02:40.160
 I got into this for digital minimalism,

2:02:40.160 --> 2:02:42.320
 the more you sacrifice on behalf of the connection,

2:02:42.320 --> 2:02:44.240
 the stronger the connection feels, right?

2:02:44.240 --> 2:02:47.000
 So sacrificing non trivial time and attention

2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:48.920
 on behalf of someone is what tells your brain

2:02:48.920 --> 2:02:52.080
 that this is a serious relationship,

2:02:52.080 --> 2:02:54.680
 which is why social media had this paradoxical effect

2:02:54.680 --> 2:02:56.920
 making people feel less social

2:02:56.920 --> 2:02:58.360
 because it took the friction out of it.

2:02:58.360 --> 2:02:59.680
 And so the brain just doesn't like,

2:02:59.680 --> 2:03:01.880
 like, yeah, you've been commenting on this person's,

2:03:01.880 --> 2:03:03.440
 whatever, you've been retweeting them

2:03:03.440 --> 2:03:05.400
 or sending them some text.

2:03:05.400 --> 2:03:07.520
 You haven't, it's not hard enough.

2:03:07.520 --> 2:03:09.720
 And then the perceived strength

2:03:09.720 --> 2:03:11.080
 of that social connection diminishes

2:03:11.080 --> 2:03:13.320
 where if you talk to them or go spend time with them

2:03:13.320 --> 2:03:16.160
 or whatever, you're gonna feel better about it.

2:03:16.160 --> 2:03:17.720
 So the friction is good.

2:03:17.720 --> 2:03:18.920
 I have a thing with some of my friends

2:03:18.920 --> 2:03:20.680
 where at the end of each call,

2:03:20.680 --> 2:03:23.120
 we take a couple minutes to schedule the next.

2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:23.960
 Then you never have to,

2:03:23.960 --> 2:03:25.360
 it's like I do with haircuts or something, right?

2:03:25.360 --> 2:03:27.320
 Like if I don't schedule it then,

2:03:27.320 --> 2:03:29.120
 I'm never gonna get my haircut, right?

2:03:29.120 --> 2:03:32.200
 And so it's like, okay, when do you wanna talk next?

2:03:32.200 --> 2:03:34.200
 Yeah, that's a really good idea.

2:03:34.200 --> 2:03:36.080
 I just don't call friends.

2:03:36.080 --> 2:03:39.680
 And like every 10 years I do something dramatic for them

2:03:39.680 --> 2:03:40.960
 so that we maintain the friendship.

2:03:40.960 --> 2:03:43.560
 We're like, I'd murder somebody that they really don't like.

2:03:43.560 --> 2:03:44.400
 Yeah, exactly.

2:03:44.400 --> 2:03:46.880
 Careful, man, Joey might ask you to do that.

2:03:46.880 --> 2:03:49.320
 Yeah, that's why, that's one of my favorite things.

2:03:49.320 --> 2:03:51.560
 Lex, I need you to come down to New Jersey.

2:03:51.560 --> 2:03:52.400
 That's exactly what we're gonna do.

2:03:52.400 --> 2:03:54.120
 With that robot dog of yours.

2:03:55.320 --> 2:03:56.720
 We're gonna go down to New Jersey.

2:03:56.720 --> 2:03:57.800
 There's a special human.

2:03:57.800 --> 2:04:00.000
 I love the comedian world.

2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:01.520
 They've been shaking up.

2:04:01.520 --> 2:04:04.080
 I don't know if you listen to Joe Rogan, all those folks.

2:04:04.080 --> 2:04:08.120
 They kind of are doing something interesting

2:04:08.120 --> 2:04:10.480
 for MIT and academia.

2:04:10.480 --> 2:04:13.080
 They're shaking up this world a little bit.

2:04:13.080 --> 2:04:15.520
 Like podcasting, because comedians are paving the way

2:04:15.520 --> 2:04:17.040
 for podcasting.

2:04:17.040 --> 2:04:18.800
 And so you have like Andrew Huberman,

2:04:18.800 --> 2:04:21.400
 who's a neuroscientist at Stanford, friend of mine now.

2:04:23.400 --> 2:04:27.080
 He's like into podcasting now and you're into podcasting.

2:04:27.080 --> 2:04:29.160
 Of course, you're not necessarily podcasting

2:04:29.160 --> 2:04:30.960
 about computer science currently, right?

2:04:30.960 --> 2:04:35.760
 But that, it feels like you could have a lot

2:04:35.760 --> 2:04:40.480
 of the free spirit of the comedians implemented

2:04:40.480 --> 2:04:43.880
 by the people who are academically trained.

2:04:43.880 --> 2:04:46.720
 Who actually have a niche specialty.

2:04:46.720 --> 2:04:49.240
 Yeah, and then that results, I mean,

2:04:49.240 --> 2:04:51.320
 who knows what the experiment looks like,

2:04:51.320 --> 2:04:54.160
 but that results me being able to talk about robotics

2:04:54.160 --> 2:04:56.920
 with Joey Diaz when he says, you know,

2:04:56.920 --> 2:04:58.640
 drops F bombs every other sentence.

2:04:58.640 --> 2:05:02.720
 And I, the world is like, I've seen actually a shift

2:05:02.720 --> 2:05:06.240
 within colleagues and friends within MIT

2:05:06.240 --> 2:05:08.480
 where they're becoming much more accepting

2:05:08.480 --> 2:05:09.320
 of that kind of thing.

2:05:09.320 --> 2:05:10.480
 It's very interesting.

2:05:10.480 --> 2:05:11.320
 That's interesting.

2:05:11.320 --> 2:05:12.720
 So you're seeing, okay.

2:05:12.720 --> 2:05:14.480
 Because they're seeing how popular it is.

2:05:14.480 --> 2:05:15.320
 They're like, wait a minute.

2:05:15.320 --> 2:05:16.160
 Well, you're really popular.

2:05:16.160 --> 2:05:17.320
 I don't know how they think about it

2:05:17.320 --> 2:05:18.880
 at Georgetown, for example.

2:05:18.880 --> 2:05:19.720
 I don't know.

2:05:19.720 --> 2:05:22.080
 It's interesting, but I think what happens

2:05:22.080 --> 2:05:25.160
 is the popularity of it combined

2:05:25.160 --> 2:05:29.760
 with just good conversations with people they respect.

2:05:29.760 --> 2:05:32.720
 It's like, oh, wait, this is the thing.

2:05:32.720 --> 2:05:33.560
 Yeah.

2:05:33.560 --> 2:05:34.760
 And this is more fun to listen to

2:05:34.760 --> 2:05:39.160
 than a shitty Zoom lecture about their work.

2:05:39.160 --> 2:05:40.000
 Yeah.

2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:40.840
 It's like, there's something here.

2:05:40.840 --> 2:05:41.680
 There's something interesting.

2:05:41.680 --> 2:05:44.000
 And we don't, nobody actually knows what that is.

2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:46.560
 Just like with like Clubhouse or something,

2:05:46.560 --> 2:05:49.120
 nobody's figured out like, where does this medium take?

2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:51.520
 Is this a legitimate medium of education?

2:05:51.520 --> 2:05:52.360
 Yeah.

2:05:52.360 --> 2:05:54.320
 Or is this just like a fun?

2:05:54.320 --> 2:05:55.520
 Well, that's your innovation, I think,

2:05:55.520 --> 2:05:58.040
 was we can bring on professors.

2:05:58.040 --> 2:05:58.880
 Yeah.

2:05:58.880 --> 2:06:00.560
 And I know Joe Rogan did some of that too,

2:06:00.560 --> 2:06:04.880
 but your professors in your field.

2:06:04.880 --> 2:06:05.720
 Yeah, exactly.

2:06:05.720 --> 2:06:08.280
 You bring on all these MIT guys who I remember.

2:06:08.280 --> 2:06:10.160
 Well, that's been the big challenge for me is,

2:06:10.160 --> 2:06:13.400
 I don't, is I feel,

2:06:15.160 --> 2:06:17.680
 I would ask big like philosophical questions

2:06:17.680 --> 2:06:20.760
 of people like yourself.

2:06:20.760 --> 2:06:23.480
 They're like really well public.

2:06:23.480 --> 2:06:25.920
 Like, so for example, you have a lot of excellent papers

2:06:25.920 --> 2:06:30.920
 on, you know, that has a lot of theory in it, right?

2:06:31.280 --> 2:06:35.400
 And there's some temptation to just go through papers.

2:06:35.400 --> 2:06:37.040
 And I think it's possible to actually do that.

2:06:37.040 --> 2:06:39.400
 I haven't done that much, but I think it's possible.

2:06:39.400 --> 2:06:41.680
 It just requires a lot of preparation.

2:06:41.680 --> 2:06:43.880
 And I can probably only do that with things

2:06:43.880 --> 2:06:48.040
 that I'm actually like in the field I'm aware of.

2:06:48.040 --> 2:06:51.080
 But there's a dance that I would love to be able

2:06:51.080 --> 2:06:53.280
 to try to hit right where it's actually getting

2:06:53.280 --> 2:06:54.960
 to the core of some interesting ideas

2:06:54.960 --> 2:06:56.920
 as opposed to just talking about philosophy.

2:06:56.920 --> 2:06:59.800
 At the same time, there's a large audience of people

2:06:59.800 --> 2:07:04.280
 that just want to be inspired by disciplines

2:07:04.280 --> 2:07:07.200
 where they don't necessarily know the details.

2:07:07.200 --> 2:07:08.520
 But there's a lot of people that are like,

2:07:08.520 --> 2:07:10.600
 hmm, I'm really curious.

2:07:10.600 --> 2:07:13.080
 I've been thinking about pivoting careers

2:07:13.080 --> 2:07:14.680
 into software engineering.

2:07:14.680 --> 2:07:16.680
 They would love to hear from people like you

2:07:16.680 --> 2:07:17.920
 about computer science.

2:07:17.920 --> 2:07:19.240
 Even if it's like theory.

2:07:19.240 --> 2:07:22.120
 Yeah, but just like the idea that you can have big ideas,

2:07:22.120 --> 2:07:24.000
 you push them through and it's interesting,

2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:25.120
 you fight for it, yeah.

2:07:25.120 --> 2:07:27.640
 Well, there's some, there's what is it?

2:07:27.640 --> 2:07:32.640
 Computerphile and Numberphile, these YouTube channels.

2:07:33.080 --> 2:07:37.160
 There's channels I watch on like chess, exceptionally popular

2:07:37.160 --> 2:07:41.400
 where I don't understand maybe 80% of the time

2:07:41.400 --> 2:07:42.640
 what the hell they're talking about

2:07:42.640 --> 2:07:44.520
 because they're talking about like why this move

2:07:44.520 --> 2:07:45.480
 is better than this move.

2:07:45.480 --> 2:07:48.400
 But I love the passion and the genius of those people

2:07:48.400 --> 2:07:49.600
 and just overhearing it.

2:07:49.600 --> 2:07:50.440
 Yeah.

2:07:50.440 --> 2:07:52.000
 I don't know why that's so exciting.

2:07:52.000 --> 2:07:53.960
 Do you look at like Scott Aaronson's blog at all?

2:07:53.960 --> 2:07:55.120
 The Settled, Optimized?

2:07:55.120 --> 2:07:57.800
 Yeah, it's like hardcore complexity theory.

2:07:57.800 --> 2:08:01.160
 But it's just an enthusiasm or like Terry Tao's blog.

2:08:01.160 --> 2:08:02.600
 A little bit of humor about it.

2:08:02.600 --> 2:08:03.800
 Terry Tao has a blog?

2:08:03.800 --> 2:08:04.640
 He used to, yeah.

2:08:05.840 --> 2:08:09.040
 And it would just be, I'm going all in on,

2:08:09.040 --> 2:08:11.560
 here's a new affine group with which you can do whatever.

2:08:11.560 --> 2:08:12.960
 Whatever, it was just equations.

2:08:12.960 --> 2:08:14.240
 Well, in the case of Scott Aaronson,

2:08:14.240 --> 2:08:19.240
 he's good, he's able to turn on like the inner troll

2:08:19.320 --> 2:08:20.560
 and comedian and so on.

2:08:20.560 --> 2:08:21.400
 Yeah.

2:08:21.400 --> 2:08:22.760
 He keeps the fun, which is the best

2:08:22.760 --> 2:08:24.120
 of kinds of books. And he's a philosophical guy.

2:08:24.120 --> 2:08:24.960
 He wrote that.

2:08:24.960 --> 2:08:27.080
 He turns on the philosophy. Yeah.

2:08:27.080 --> 2:08:30.360
 Yeah, so we're exploring these different ways

2:08:30.360 --> 2:08:33.440
 of communicating science and exciting the world.

2:08:33.440 --> 2:08:36.600
 Speaking of which, I gotta ask you about computer science.

2:08:36.600 --> 2:08:39.280
 Yeah, that's right, I do some of that.

2:08:39.280 --> 2:08:43.560
 So, I mean, a lot of your work is what inspired

2:08:43.560 --> 2:08:46.440
 this deep thinking about productivity

2:08:46.440 --> 2:08:48.760
 from all the different angles,

2:08:48.760 --> 2:08:50.400
 because some of the most rigorous work

2:08:50.400 --> 2:08:52.040
 is mathematical work.

2:08:52.040 --> 2:08:55.040
 And in computer science, the theoretical computer science,

2:08:55.040 --> 2:08:57.440
 let me ask the Scott Aaronson question of like,

2:08:57.440 --> 2:09:00.760
 is there something to you that stands out in particular

2:09:00.760 --> 2:09:03.440
 that's beautiful or inspiring,

2:09:03.440 --> 2:09:05.920
 or just really insightful about computer science

2:09:05.920 --> 2:09:08.440
 or maybe mathematics?

2:09:08.440 --> 2:09:11.240
 I mean, I like theory.

2:09:11.240 --> 2:09:13.120
 And in particular, what I've always liked in theory

2:09:13.120 --> 2:09:14.880
 is the notion of impossibilities.

2:09:14.880 --> 2:09:16.640
 That's kind of my specialty.

2:09:16.640 --> 2:09:19.880
 So within the context of distributed algorithms,

2:09:19.880 --> 2:09:21.680
 my specialty is impossibility results.

2:09:21.680 --> 2:09:23.880
 So the idea that you can argue

2:09:23.880 --> 2:09:26.080
 nothing exists that solves this,

2:09:26.080 --> 2:09:30.520
 or nothing exists that can solve this faster than this.

2:09:30.520 --> 2:09:32.040
 And I think that's really interesting.

2:09:32.040 --> 2:09:34.640
 And that goes all the way back to Turing.

2:09:34.640 --> 2:09:37.800
 His original paper on computable numbers

2:09:37.800 --> 2:09:40.280
 with their connection to the German Eichsturzungen problem,

2:09:40.280 --> 2:09:41.880
 but basically the German name

2:09:41.880 --> 2:09:43.440
 that Hilbert called the decision problem.

2:09:43.440 --> 2:09:46.320
 This was precomputers, but he's English,

2:09:46.320 --> 2:09:47.160
 so it's written in English.

2:09:47.160 --> 2:09:48.800
 So it's a very accessible paper.

2:09:48.800 --> 2:09:50.520
 And it lays the foundation

2:09:50.520 --> 2:09:51.960
 for all of theoretical computer science.

2:09:51.960 --> 2:09:53.160
 He just has this insight.

2:09:53.160 --> 2:09:55.160
 He's like, well, if we think about like an algorithm,

2:09:55.160 --> 2:09:57.720
 I mean, he figures out like all effective procedures

2:09:57.720 --> 2:09:59.640
 or Turing machines are basically algorithms.

2:09:59.640 --> 2:10:02.040
 We could really describe a Turing machine with a number,

2:10:02.040 --> 2:10:04.160
 which we can now imagine with like computer code,

2:10:04.160 --> 2:10:05.600
 you could just take a source file

2:10:05.600 --> 2:10:07.680
 and just treat the binary version of the file

2:10:07.680 --> 2:10:09.440
 as like a really long number, right?

2:10:09.440 --> 2:10:12.440
 But he's like, every program is just a finite number.

2:10:12.440 --> 2:10:14.000
 It's a natural number.

2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:16.560
 And then he realized like one way to think about a problem

2:10:16.560 --> 2:10:19.400
 is you have, and this is like kind of the Mike Sipser

2:10:19.400 --> 2:10:21.800
 approach, but you have a sort of, it's a language.

2:10:21.800 --> 2:10:23.480
 So of an infinite number of strings,

2:10:23.480 --> 2:10:25.040
 some of them are in the language and some of them aren't,

2:10:25.040 --> 2:10:27.360
 but basically you can imagine a problem is represented

2:10:27.360 --> 2:10:29.360
 as an infinite binary string,

2:10:29.360 --> 2:10:31.440
 where in every position, like a one means that string

2:10:31.440 --> 2:10:33.640
 is in the language and a zero means it isn't.

2:10:33.640 --> 2:10:37.520
 And then he applied Cantor from the 19th century and said,

2:10:37.520 --> 2:10:39.760
 okay, the natural numbers are countable.

2:10:39.760 --> 2:10:43.760
 So it's countably infinite and infinite binary strings,

2:10:43.760 --> 2:10:45.160
 you can use a diagonalization argument

2:10:45.160 --> 2:10:47.960
 and show they're uncountable.

2:10:47.960 --> 2:10:50.800
 So there's just vastly more problems

2:10:50.800 --> 2:10:51.920
 than there are algorithms.

2:10:51.920 --> 2:10:54.000
 So basically anything you can come up with for the most part

2:10:54.000 --> 2:10:56.640
 almost certainly is not solvable by a computer.

2:10:56.640 --> 2:10:58.800
 And then he was like, let me give a particular example.

2:10:58.800 --> 2:11:01.240
 And he figured out the very first computability proof.

2:11:01.240 --> 2:11:03.760
 Let's just walk through with a little bit of simple logic

2:11:03.760 --> 2:11:05.920
 to halting problem can't be solved by an algorithm.

2:11:05.920 --> 2:11:08.840
 And that kicked off the whole enterprise

2:11:08.840 --> 2:11:12.800
 of some things can't be solved by algorithms,

2:11:12.800 --> 2:11:14.280
 some things can't be solved by computers.

2:11:14.280 --> 2:11:16.280
 And we've just been doing theory on that

2:11:16.280 --> 2:11:18.600
 since that was the 30s he wrote that.

2:11:18.600 --> 2:11:21.120
 So proving that something is impossible

2:11:21.120 --> 2:11:23.400
 is sort of a stricter version of that.

2:11:23.400 --> 2:11:26.280
 Is it like proving bounds on the performance

2:11:26.280 --> 2:11:27.120
 of different algorithms?

2:11:27.120 --> 2:11:29.360
 Yeah, so bounds are upper bounds, right?

2:11:29.360 --> 2:11:32.920
 So you say, this algorithm does at least this well

2:11:32.920 --> 2:11:33.760
 and no worse than this,

2:11:33.760 --> 2:11:35.600
 but you're looking at a particular algorithm

2:11:35.600 --> 2:11:39.240
 and possibility proof say no algorithm ever

2:11:39.240 --> 2:11:40.160
 could ever solve this problem.

2:11:40.160 --> 2:11:42.520
 So no algorithm could ever solve the halting problem.

2:11:42.520 --> 2:11:43.920
 So it's problem centric.

2:11:43.920 --> 2:11:46.160
 It's making something different,

2:11:46.160 --> 2:11:48.520
 making a conclusive statement about the problem.

2:11:48.520 --> 2:11:49.360
 Yes.

2:11:49.360 --> 2:11:51.800
 And that's somehow satisfying because it's...

2:11:51.800 --> 2:11:53.200
 It's just philosophically interesting.

2:11:53.200 --> 2:11:54.040
 Yeah.

2:11:54.040 --> 2:11:55.880
 I mean, it all goes back to, you get back to Plato,

2:11:55.880 --> 2:11:58.360
 it's all reductio ad absurdum.

2:11:58.360 --> 2:11:59.680
 So all these arguments have to start.

2:11:59.680 --> 2:12:00.520
 The only way to do it

2:12:00.520 --> 2:12:01.960
 is because there's an infinite number of solutions

2:12:01.960 --> 2:12:02.800
 you can't go through them.

2:12:02.800 --> 2:12:06.360
 You say, let's assume for the sake of contradiction

2:12:06.360 --> 2:12:09.080
 that there existed something that solves this problem.

2:12:09.080 --> 2:12:10.320
 And then you turn to crank a logic

2:12:10.320 --> 2:12:11.760
 until you blow up the universe.

2:12:11.760 --> 2:12:12.600
 And then you go back and say,

2:12:12.600 --> 2:12:13.960
 okay, our original assumption

2:12:13.960 --> 2:12:16.560
 that this solution exists can't be true.

2:12:16.560 --> 2:12:17.720
 I just think philosophically,

2:12:17.720 --> 2:12:19.800
 it's like a really exciting kind of beautiful thing.

2:12:19.800 --> 2:12:22.120
 It's what I specialize in within distributed algorithms

2:12:22.120 --> 2:12:24.880
 is more like time bound and possibility results.

2:12:24.880 --> 2:12:28.740
 Like no algorithm can solve this problem faster than this

2:12:28.740 --> 2:12:29.720
 in this setting.

2:12:29.720 --> 2:12:32.120
 Of all the infinite number of ways you might ever do it.

2:12:32.120 --> 2:12:34.120
 So you have many papers,

2:12:34.120 --> 2:12:35.480
 but the one that caught my eye

2:12:35.480 --> 2:12:38.440
 is Smooth Analysis of Dynamic Networks,

2:12:38.440 --> 2:12:40.680
 in which you write,

2:12:40.680 --> 2:12:42.800
 a problem with the worst case perspective

2:12:42.800 --> 2:12:45.640
 is that it often leads to extremely strong lower bounds.

2:12:45.640 --> 2:12:48.120
 These strong results motivate a key question.

2:12:48.120 --> 2:12:49.920
 Is this bond robust in the sense

2:12:49.920 --> 2:12:52.080
 that it captures the fundamental difficulty

2:12:52.080 --> 2:12:53.960
 introduced by dynamism?

2:12:53.960 --> 2:12:56.600
 Or is the bond fragile in the sense

2:12:56.600 --> 2:12:58.320
 that the poor performance it describes

2:12:58.320 --> 2:13:02.080
 depends on an exact sequence of adversarial changes.

2:13:02.080 --> 2:13:05.240
 Fragile lower bounds leave open the possibility

2:13:05.240 --> 2:13:08.680
 of algorithms that might still perform well in practice.

2:13:08.680 --> 2:13:11.760
 That's in the sense of the impossible

2:13:11.760 --> 2:13:15.280
 and the bounds discussion presents the interesting question.

2:13:15.280 --> 2:13:18.440
 I just like the idea of robust and fragile bounds,

2:13:18.440 --> 2:13:23.000
 but what do you make about this kind of tension

2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:25.760
 between what's provably,

2:13:25.760 --> 2:13:30.000
 like what bounds you can prove that are like robust

2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:32.520
 and something that's a bit more fragile.

2:13:32.520 --> 2:13:36.040
 And also by way of answering that

2:13:36.040 --> 2:13:38.120
 for this particular paper,

2:13:38.120 --> 2:13:41.400
 can you say what the hell are dynamic networks?

2:13:41.400 --> 2:13:42.240
 What are distributed algorithms?

2:13:42.240 --> 2:13:43.080
 You don't know this?

2:13:43.080 --> 2:13:43.920
 Come on now.

2:13:43.920 --> 2:13:44.880
 And I have no idea.

2:13:44.880 --> 2:13:46.160
 And what is Smooth Analysis?

2:13:46.160 --> 2:13:47.000
 Yeah, well, okay.

2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:49.960
 So Smooth Analysis, so it wasn't my idea.

2:13:49.960 --> 2:13:52.400
 So Spielman and Tang came up with this

2:13:52.400 --> 2:13:54.320
 in the context of sequential algorithms.

2:13:54.320 --> 2:13:57.040
 So just like the normal world of an algorithm

2:13:57.040 --> 2:13:58.440
 that runs on a computer.

2:13:58.440 --> 2:14:01.640
 And they were looking at, there's a well known algorithm

2:14:01.640 --> 2:14:02.760
 called the simplex algorithm,

2:14:02.760 --> 2:14:06.440
 but basically you're trying to find a hole

2:14:06.440 --> 2:14:07.480
 around a group of points.

2:14:07.480 --> 2:14:08.320
 And there was an algorithm

2:14:08.320 --> 2:14:10.480
 that worked really well in practice.

2:14:10.480 --> 2:14:12.080
 But when you analyze it, you would say,

2:14:12.080 --> 2:14:13.960
 I can't guarantee it's gonna work well in practice

2:14:13.960 --> 2:14:16.400
 because if you have just the right inputs,

2:14:16.400 --> 2:14:18.960
 this thing could run really long.

2:14:18.960 --> 2:14:20.480
 But in practice, it seemed to be really fast.

2:14:20.480 --> 2:14:22.560
 So Smooth Analysis is they came in and they said,

2:14:22.560 --> 2:14:25.960
 let's assume that a bad guy chooses the inputs.

2:14:25.960 --> 2:14:27.880
 It could be anything like really bad ones.

2:14:27.880 --> 2:14:30.880
 And all we're gonna do, because in simplex they're numbers,

2:14:30.880 --> 2:14:33.520
 we're gonna just randomly put a little bit of noise

2:14:33.520 --> 2:14:34.720
 on each of the numbers.

2:14:34.720 --> 2:14:36.080
 And they said, if you put a little bit of noise

2:14:36.080 --> 2:14:39.720
 on the numbers, suddenly simplex algorithm goes really fast.

2:14:39.720 --> 2:14:41.680
 Like, oh, that explains this lower bound,

2:14:41.680 --> 2:14:44.280
 this idea that it could sometimes run really long

2:14:44.280 --> 2:14:46.280
 was a fragile bound because it could only run

2:14:46.280 --> 2:14:47.840
 a really long time if you had exactly

2:14:47.840 --> 2:14:49.800
 the worst pathological input.

2:14:49.800 --> 2:14:51.560
 So then my collaborators and I brought this over

2:14:51.560 --> 2:14:53.560
 to the world of distributed algorithms.

2:14:53.560 --> 2:14:55.360
 We brought them over the general lower bounds, right?

2:14:55.360 --> 2:14:58.080
 So in the world of dynamic networks,

2:14:58.080 --> 2:15:00.080
 so distributed algorithm is a bunch of algorithms

2:15:00.080 --> 2:15:02.440
 on different machines talking to each other,

2:15:02.440 --> 2:15:03.280
 trying to solve a problem.

2:15:03.280 --> 2:15:05.000
 And sometimes they're in a network.

2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:07.440
 So you imagine them connected with network links

2:15:07.440 --> 2:15:10.000
 and a dynamic network, those can change, right?

2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:12.280
 So I was talking to you, but now I can't talk to you anymore.

2:15:12.280 --> 2:15:14.000
 Now I'm connected to a person over here.

2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:16.440
 It's a really hard environment mathematically speaking.

2:15:16.440 --> 2:15:19.040
 And there's a lot of really strong lower bounds,

2:15:19.040 --> 2:15:20.720
 which you could imagine if the network can change

2:15:20.720 --> 2:15:23.520
 all the time and a bad guy is doing it,

2:15:23.520 --> 2:15:24.960
 it's like hard to do things well.

2:15:24.960 --> 2:15:27.280
 So there's an algorithm running on every single node

2:15:27.280 --> 2:15:28.120
 in the network.

2:15:28.120 --> 2:15:28.960
 Yeah.

2:15:28.960 --> 2:15:30.760
 And then you're trying to say something of any kind

2:15:30.760 --> 2:15:32.840
 that makes any kind of definitive sense

2:15:32.840 --> 2:15:34.800
 about the performance of that algorithm.

2:15:34.800 --> 2:15:37.520
 Yeah, so I just submitted a new paper on this

2:15:37.520 --> 2:15:38.360
 a couple of weeks ago.

2:15:38.360 --> 2:15:39.840
 And we were looking at a very simple problem.

2:15:39.840 --> 2:15:42.280
 There's some messages in the network.

2:15:42.280 --> 2:15:44.200
 We want everyone to get them.

2:15:44.200 --> 2:15:46.880
 If the network doesn't change,

2:15:46.880 --> 2:15:47.860
 you can do this pretty well.

2:15:47.860 --> 2:15:48.700
 You can pipeline them.

2:15:48.700 --> 2:15:52.120
 There's some basic algorithms that work really well.

2:15:52.120 --> 2:15:54.100
 If the network can change every round,

2:15:54.100 --> 2:15:57.040
 there's these lower bounds that says,

2:15:57.040 --> 2:15:58.020
 it takes a really long time.

2:15:58.020 --> 2:16:00.160
 There's a way that no matter what algorithm you come up with,

2:16:00.160 --> 2:16:02.100
 there's a way the network can change in such a way

2:16:02.100 --> 2:16:05.600
 that just really slows down your progress basically, right?

2:16:05.600 --> 2:16:07.240
 So smooth analysis there says, yeah,

2:16:07.240 --> 2:16:10.140
 but that seems like you'd have really bad luck

2:16:10.140 --> 2:16:14.520
 if your network was changing exactly in the right way

2:16:14.520 --> 2:16:15.920
 that you needed to screw your algorithm.

2:16:15.920 --> 2:16:19.120
 So we said, what if we randomly just add

2:16:19.120 --> 2:16:20.600
 or remove a couple of edges in every round?

2:16:20.600 --> 2:16:21.640
 So the adversary is trying to choose

2:16:21.640 --> 2:16:22.640
 the worst possible network.

2:16:22.640 --> 2:16:24.800
 And we're just tweaking it a little bit.

2:16:24.800 --> 2:16:25.960
 And in that case, this is a new paper.

2:16:25.960 --> 2:16:27.520
 I mean, it's a blinded submission,

2:16:27.520 --> 2:16:30.320
 so maybe I shouldn't, it's not, whatever.

2:16:30.320 --> 2:16:31.640
 We basically showed.

2:16:31.640 --> 2:16:33.600
 An anonymous friend of yours submitted a paper.

2:16:33.600 --> 2:16:35.720
 An anonymous friend of mine, yeah,

2:16:35.720 --> 2:16:37.840
 whose paper should be accepted.

2:16:37.840 --> 2:16:40.680
 Showed that even just adding like one random edge per round,

2:16:42.480 --> 2:16:43.320
 and here's the cool thing about it,

2:16:43.320 --> 2:16:46.080
 the simplest possible solution to this problem

2:16:46.080 --> 2:16:47.920
 blows away that lower bound and does really well.

2:16:47.920 --> 2:16:50.120
 So that's like a very fragile lower bound

2:16:50.120 --> 2:16:53.120
 because we're like, it's almost impossible

2:16:53.120 --> 2:16:55.360
 to actually keep things slow.

2:16:55.360 --> 2:16:59.920
 I wonder how many lower bounds you can smash open

2:16:59.920 --> 2:17:02.440
 with this kind of analysis and show that they're fragile.

2:17:02.440 --> 2:17:03.640
 It's my interest, yeah.

2:17:03.640 --> 2:17:05.680
 Because in distributed algorithms,

2:17:05.680 --> 2:17:08.320
 there's a ton of really famous strong lower bounds,

2:17:08.320 --> 2:17:12.520
 but things have to go wrong, really, really wrong

2:17:12.520 --> 2:17:14.600
 for these lower bound arguments to work.

2:17:14.600 --> 2:17:15.680
 And so I like this approach.

2:17:15.680 --> 2:17:17.960
 So this whole notion of fragile versus robust,

2:17:17.960 --> 2:17:20.200
 I was like, well, let's go in and just throw

2:17:20.200 --> 2:17:21.080
 a little noise in there.

2:17:21.080 --> 2:17:23.880
 And if it becomes solvable, then maybe that lower bound

2:17:23.880 --> 2:17:25.520
 wasn't really something we should worry about.

2:17:25.520 --> 2:17:27.320
 You know, that's gonna embarrass,

2:17:27.320 --> 2:17:28.560
 that's really uncomfortable.

2:17:28.560 --> 2:17:31.480
 That's really embarrassing to a lot of people.

2:17:31.480 --> 2:17:35.880
 Because, okay, this is the OCD thing with the spaces,

2:17:35.880 --> 2:17:39.000
 is it feels really good when you can prove a nice bound.

2:17:39.000 --> 2:17:43.400
 And if you say that that bound is fragile,

2:17:43.400 --> 2:17:46.080
 that's like, there's gonna be a sad kid

2:17:46.080 --> 2:17:49.760
 that walks with their lunchbox back home,

2:17:49.760 --> 2:17:52.320
 like, my lower bound doesn't matter.

2:17:52.320 --> 2:17:53.280
 No, I don't think they care.

2:17:53.280 --> 2:17:55.400
 It's all, I don't know, it feels like to me,

2:17:55.400 --> 2:17:57.680
 a lot of this theory is just math machismo.

2:17:57.680 --> 2:18:00.440
 It's like, whatever, this was a hard bound to prove.

2:18:00.440 --> 2:18:02.240
 What do you think about that?

2:18:02.240 --> 2:18:03.720
 So if you show that something is fragile,

2:18:03.720 --> 2:18:07.200
 that's really important in practice, right?

2:18:08.280 --> 2:18:10.760
 So do you think kind of theoretical computer science

2:18:10.760 --> 2:18:13.320
 is living its own world, just like mathematics,

2:18:13.320 --> 2:18:16.320
 and their main effort, which I think is very valuable,

2:18:16.320 --> 2:18:19.360
 is to develop ideas that's not necessarily interesting,

2:18:19.360 --> 2:18:21.040
 whether it's applicable in the real world.

2:18:21.040 --> 2:18:22.720
 Yeah, we don't care about the applicability.

2:18:22.720 --> 2:18:24.640
 Yeah, we kind of do, but not really.

2:18:24.640 --> 2:18:26.120
 And we're terrible with computers,

2:18:26.120 --> 2:18:27.800
 and can't do anything useful with computers,

2:18:27.800 --> 2:18:28.720
 and we don't know how to code.

2:18:28.720 --> 2:18:31.880
 And, you know, we're not productive members

2:18:31.880 --> 2:18:33.320
 of like technological society,

2:18:33.320 --> 2:18:36.280
 but I do think things percolate.

2:18:36.280 --> 2:18:37.120
 Exactly.

2:18:37.120 --> 2:18:38.680
 You percolate from the world of theory

2:18:38.680 --> 2:18:40.120
 into the world of algorithm design,

2:18:40.120 --> 2:18:41.280
 where it will pull on the theory,

2:18:41.280 --> 2:18:43.360
 and now suddenly it's useful,

2:18:43.360 --> 2:18:44.480
 and then the algorithm design

2:18:44.480 --> 2:18:45.840
 gets pulled into the world of practice,

2:18:45.840 --> 2:18:46.680
 where they say, well, actually,

2:18:46.680 --> 2:18:47.800
 we can make this algorithm a lot better,

2:18:47.800 --> 2:18:50.120
 because in practice, really, these servers do X, Y, Z,

2:18:50.120 --> 2:18:51.680
 and now we can make this super efficient.

2:18:51.680 --> 2:18:54.600
 And so I do think, I mean, I teach theory

2:18:54.600 --> 2:18:56.560
 to the PhD students at Georgetown.

2:18:56.560 --> 2:18:58.960
 I show them the sort of funnel of like,

2:18:58.960 --> 2:19:00.120
 okay, we're over here doing theory,

2:19:00.120 --> 2:19:01.640
 but it eventually, some of this stuff

2:19:01.640 --> 2:19:04.440
 will percolate down in effect at the very end, you know,

2:19:04.440 --> 2:19:08.120
 a phone, but it's a long tunnel.

2:19:08.120 --> 2:19:10.080
 But the very question you're asking,

2:19:10.080 --> 2:19:12.400
 at the highest philosophical level, is fascinating.

2:19:12.400 --> 2:19:15.000
 Like, if you take a system, a distributed system,

2:19:15.000 --> 2:19:19.520
 or a network, and introduce a little bit of noise into it,

2:19:19.520 --> 2:19:23.320
 like, how many problems of that nature

2:19:23.320 --> 2:19:25.240
 are fundamentally changed

2:19:25.240 --> 2:19:27.560
 by that little introduction of noise?

2:19:27.560 --> 2:19:29.080
 Yeah, because it's all,

2:19:29.080 --> 2:19:30.280
 especially in distributed algorithms,

2:19:30.280 --> 2:19:31.560
 the model is everything.

2:19:31.560 --> 2:19:34.160
 Like, the way we work is we're incredibly precise about,

2:19:34.160 --> 2:19:36.040
 here's exactly, it's mathematical,

2:19:36.040 --> 2:19:37.560
 here's exactly how the network works,

2:19:37.560 --> 2:19:40.160
 and it's a state machine, algorithms are state machines,

2:19:40.160 --> 2:19:41.360
 there's rounds and schedulers,

2:19:41.360 --> 2:19:44.200
 we're super precise so we can prove lower bounds.

2:19:44.200 --> 2:19:45.120
 But yeah, often those lower,

2:19:45.120 --> 2:19:48.800
 those impossibility results really get at the hard edges

2:19:48.800 --> 2:19:50.560
 of exactly how that model works.

2:19:50.560 --> 2:19:53.560
 So we'll see if this, so we published a paper on this,

2:19:53.560 --> 2:19:55.560
 that paper you mentioned,

2:19:55.560 --> 2:19:56.800
 that kind of introduced the idea

2:19:56.800 --> 2:19:58.120
 to the distributed algorithms world.

2:19:58.120 --> 2:20:01.120
 And I think that's got some traction

2:20:01.120 --> 2:20:02.200
 and there's been some followup.

2:20:02.200 --> 2:20:05.720
 So we've just submitted our next.

2:20:05.720 --> 2:20:07.000
 I mean, honestly, the issue with the next

2:20:07.000 --> 2:20:09.320
 that like the result fell out so easily,

2:20:09.320 --> 2:20:11.080
 and this shows the mathematical machismo problem

2:20:11.080 --> 2:20:13.920
 in these fields is there's a good chance

2:20:13.920 --> 2:20:15.000
 the paper won't be accepted

2:20:15.000 --> 2:20:18.200
 because there wasn't enough mathematical self flagellation.

2:20:18.200 --> 2:20:20.240
 That's such a nice finding.

2:20:20.240 --> 2:20:22.560
 So even showing that very few,

2:20:22.560 --> 2:20:24.360
 just very little bit of noise,

2:20:24.360 --> 2:20:28.000
 can have a dramatic, make a dramatic statement about the.

2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:29.360
 It was a big surprise to us,

2:20:29.360 --> 2:20:31.520
 but once we figured out how to show it,

2:20:32.440 --> 2:20:34.120
 it's not too hard.

2:20:34.120 --> 2:20:38.880
 And these are venues for theoretical work.

2:20:38.880 --> 2:20:41.160
 Okay, so the fascinating tension

2:20:41.160 --> 2:20:42.520
 that exists in other disciplines,

2:20:42.520 --> 2:20:45.000
 like one of them is machine learning,

2:20:45.000 --> 2:20:48.760
 which despite the power of machine learning

2:20:48.760 --> 2:20:52.720
 and deep learning and all like the impact of it,

2:20:52.720 --> 2:20:53.840
 in the real world,

2:20:53.840 --> 2:20:55.960
 the main conferences on machine learning

2:20:55.960 --> 2:20:58.400
 are still resistant to application papers.

2:21:01.480 --> 2:21:03.880
 And application papers broadly defined,

2:21:03.880 --> 2:21:08.160
 meaning like finding almost like you would,

2:21:08.160 --> 2:21:12.760
 like Darwin did by like going around,

2:21:12.760 --> 2:21:14.040
 collecting some information,

2:21:14.040 --> 2:21:15.800
 saying, huh, isn't this interesting?

2:21:16.760 --> 2:21:19.200
 Like those are some of the most popular blogs,

2:21:19.200 --> 2:21:21.320
 and yet as a paper, it's not really accepted.

2:21:21.320 --> 2:21:23.400
 I wonder what you think about this whole world

2:21:23.400 --> 2:21:27.900
 of deep learning from a perspective of theory.

2:21:29.480 --> 2:21:31.720
 What do you make of this whole discipline

2:21:31.720 --> 2:21:33.240
 of the success of Neon Networks,

2:21:33.240 --> 2:21:34.920
 of how to do science on them?

2:21:34.920 --> 2:21:37.960
 Are you excited by the possibilities

2:21:37.960 --> 2:21:40.080
 of what we might discover about Neon Networks?

2:21:40.080 --> 2:21:42.320
 Do you think it's fundamental in engineering discipline,

2:21:42.320 --> 2:21:44.660
 or is there something theoretical

2:21:44.660 --> 2:21:47.480
 that we might crack open one of these days

2:21:47.480 --> 2:21:48.820
 in understanding something deep

2:21:48.820 --> 2:21:52.160
 about how system optimization and how systems learn?

2:21:52.160 --> 2:21:56.160
 I am convinced by, is it Tegmark at MIT?

2:21:56.160 --> 2:21:58.000
 Tegmark? Yeah, Tegmark, right.

2:21:58.000 --> 2:22:00.200
 So his notion has always been convincing to me

2:22:00.200 --> 2:22:04.840
 that the fact that some of these models are inscrutable

2:22:04.840 --> 2:22:06.880
 is not fundamental to them,

2:22:06.880 --> 2:22:08.640
 and that we can, we're gonna get better and better,

2:22:08.640 --> 2:22:09.960
 because in the end, you know,

2:22:09.960 --> 2:22:12.640
 the reason why practicing computer scientists often

2:22:12.640 --> 2:22:15.600
 who are doing AI or working at AI and industry

2:22:15.600 --> 2:22:18.680
 aren't like worried about so much existential threats

2:22:18.680 --> 2:22:20.320
 is because they see the reality

2:22:20.320 --> 2:22:22.960
 as they're multiplying matrices with NumPy

2:22:22.960 --> 2:22:23.800
 or something like this, right?

2:22:23.800 --> 2:22:25.440
 Yeah, and tweaking constants

2:22:25.440 --> 2:22:27.800
 and hoping that the classifier fitness,

2:22:27.800 --> 2:22:30.520
 for God's sakes, before the submission deadline

2:22:30.520 --> 2:22:31.840
 actually gets above some,

2:22:31.840 --> 2:22:36.100
 it feels like it's linear algebra and tedium, right?

2:22:37.300 --> 2:22:39.320
 But anyways, I'm really convinced with his idea

2:22:39.320 --> 2:22:40.720
 that once we understand better and better

2:22:40.720 --> 2:22:42.240
 what's going on from a theory perspective,

2:22:42.240 --> 2:22:44.700
 it's gonna make it into an engineering discipline.

2:22:44.700 --> 2:22:47.240
 So in my mind, where we're gonna end up is,

2:22:47.240 --> 2:22:50.280
 okay, forget these metaphors of neurons,

2:22:50.280 --> 2:22:52.360
 and these things are gonna be put down

2:22:52.360 --> 2:22:54.860
 into these mathematical kind of elegant equations,

2:22:54.860 --> 2:22:57.600
 differentiable equations that just kind of work well,

2:22:57.600 --> 2:22:58.920
 and then it's gonna be

2:22:58.920 --> 2:23:02.280
 when I need a little bit of AI in this thing, plumbing.

2:23:02.280 --> 2:23:05.220
 Like, let's get a little bit of a pattern recognizer

2:23:05.220 --> 2:23:06.840
 with a noise module and let's connect.

2:23:06.840 --> 2:23:08.280
 I mean, you know this feel better than me,

2:23:08.280 --> 2:23:11.200
 so I don't know if this is like a reasonable prediction,

2:23:11.200 --> 2:23:14.100
 but it's gonna become less inscrutable,

2:23:14.100 --> 2:23:16.300
 and then it's gonna become more engineerable,

2:23:16.300 --> 2:23:18.580
 and then we're gonna have AI in more things

2:23:18.580 --> 2:23:20.580
 because we're gonna have a little bit more control

2:23:20.580 --> 2:23:22.540
 over how we piece together

2:23:22.540 --> 2:23:25.840
 these different classification black boxes.

2:23:25.840 --> 2:23:28.040
 So one of the problems, and there might be

2:23:28.040 --> 2:23:30.360
 some interesting parallels that you might provide intuition

2:23:30.360 --> 2:23:32.600
 on is, you know, neural networks are very large,

2:23:32.600 --> 2:23:35.000
 and they have a lot of, you know,

2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:39.040
 we were talking about, you know, dynamic networks

2:23:39.040 --> 2:23:41.860
 and distributed algorithms.

2:23:41.860 --> 2:23:45.460
 One of the problems with the analysis of neural networks

2:23:45.460 --> 2:23:48.680
 is, you know, you have a lot of nodes,

2:23:48.680 --> 2:23:50.840
 and you have a lot of edges.

2:23:50.840 --> 2:23:53.120
 To be able to interpret and to control different things

2:23:53.120 --> 2:23:53.960
 is very difficult.

2:23:53.960 --> 2:23:58.960
 There's fields in trying to figure out like mathematically

2:23:59.040 --> 2:24:04.040
 how you form clean representations that are like,

2:24:04.600 --> 2:24:07.680
 like one node contains all the information

2:24:07.680 --> 2:24:08.700
 about a particular thing,

2:24:08.700 --> 2:24:10.800
 and no other nodes is correlated to it.

2:24:10.800 --> 2:24:13.680
 So like it has unique knowledge and like,

2:24:13.680 --> 2:24:15.920
 but that ultimately boils down to trying

2:24:15.920 --> 2:24:19.000
 to simplify this thing into,

2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:20.600
 that goes against this very nature,

2:24:20.600 --> 2:24:23.200
 which is like deeply connected,

2:24:23.200 --> 2:24:27.600
 and like dynamic and just, you know,

2:24:27.600 --> 2:24:30.400
 hundreds of millions, billions of nodes.

2:24:30.400 --> 2:24:33.960
 And in a distributed sense, like when you zoom out,

2:24:33.960 --> 2:24:35.440
 the thing has a representation

2:24:35.440 --> 2:24:36.960
 and understanding of something,

2:24:36.960 --> 2:24:38.520
 but the individual nodes are just doing

2:24:38.520 --> 2:24:40.520
 their little exchanging thing.

2:24:40.520 --> 2:24:42.800
 And it's the same thing with Stephen Wolfram

2:24:42.800 --> 2:24:44.480
 when you talk about cellular automata,

2:24:44.480 --> 2:24:46.340
 it's very difficult to do math

2:24:46.340 --> 2:24:48.800
 when you have a huge collection of distributed things,

2:24:48.800 --> 2:24:50.440
 each acting on their own.

2:24:50.440 --> 2:24:54.760
 And it's almost like, it feels like it's almost impossible

2:24:54.760 --> 2:24:58.200
 to do any kind of theoretical work in the traditional sense.

2:24:58.200 --> 2:25:02.560
 It almost becomes completely like a biology,

2:25:02.560 --> 2:25:06.080
 you become a biologist as opposed to a theoretician.

2:25:06.080 --> 2:25:07.720
 You just study it experimentally.

2:25:07.720 --> 2:25:10.720
 Yeah, I think that's the big question, I guess, right?

2:25:10.720 --> 2:25:15.280
 Yeah, so is the large size and interconnectedness

2:25:15.280 --> 2:25:18.360
 of the like a deep learning network fundamental

2:25:18.360 --> 2:25:20.400
 to that task, or are we just not very good at it yet

2:25:20.400 --> 2:25:23.360
 because we're using the wrong metaphor?

2:25:23.360 --> 2:25:26.800
 I mean, the human brain learns with much fewer examples

2:25:26.800 --> 2:25:30.400
 and with much less tuning of the whatever, whatever,

2:25:30.400 --> 2:25:32.320
 whatever probably that requires to get

2:25:32.320 --> 2:25:34.480
 those like deep mind networks up and running.

2:25:34.480 --> 2:25:36.240
 But yeah, so I don't really know,

2:25:36.240 --> 2:25:38.440
 but the one thing I have observed is that the, yeah,

2:25:38.440 --> 2:25:42.080
 there's the mundane nature of some of the working

2:25:42.080 --> 2:25:45.280
 with these models tends to lead people to think that,

2:25:46.440 --> 2:25:49.200
 to do it like, it could be Skynet

2:25:49.200 --> 2:25:53.120
 or it could be like a lot of pain to get the thermostat

2:25:53.120 --> 2:25:54.520
 to do what we want it to do.

2:25:54.520 --> 2:25:56.680
 And there's a lot of open questions in between there.

2:25:56.680 --> 2:26:01.680
 And then of course, the distributed network

2:26:02.960 --> 2:26:04.720
 of humans that use these systems.

2:26:04.720 --> 2:26:07.560
 So like you can have the system itself,

2:26:07.560 --> 2:26:10.040
 then your network, but you can also have like little

2:26:10.040 --> 2:26:11.800
 algorithms controlling the behavior of humans,

2:26:11.800 --> 2:26:14.120
 which is what you have with social networks.

2:26:14.120 --> 2:26:17.520
 It's possible that a very, what is it, a toaster or whatever,

2:26:17.520 --> 2:26:20.640
 the opposite of Skynet when taken at scale

2:26:20.640 --> 2:26:22.680
 while used by individual humans and controlling

2:26:22.680 --> 2:26:25.880
 their behavior can actually have the Skynet effect.

2:26:25.880 --> 2:26:27.800
 So the scale there.

2:26:27.800 --> 2:26:29.040
 We might have that now.

2:26:29.040 --> 2:26:31.440
 We might have that now, we just don't know.

2:26:31.440 --> 2:26:32.280
 As it's happening.

2:26:32.280 --> 2:26:33.720
 Is Twitter creating a little mini Skynet?

2:26:33.720 --> 2:26:35.080
 I mean, because of what happens,

2:26:35.080 --> 2:26:38.000
 it twirls out ramifications in the world.

2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:41.480
 And is it really that much different if it's a robot

2:26:41.480 --> 2:26:44.480
 with tentacles or a bunch of servers that.

2:26:44.480 --> 2:26:47.520
 Yeah, and the destructive effects could be,

2:26:47.520 --> 2:26:51.000
 I mean, it could be political, but it could also be like,

2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:54.640
 you could probably make an interesting case that the virus,

2:26:54.640 --> 2:26:59.360
 the coronavirus spread on Twitter too,

2:26:59.360 --> 2:27:00.760
 in the minds of people.

2:27:00.760 --> 2:27:03.360
 Like the fear and the misinformation

2:27:03.360 --> 2:27:06.360
 in some very interesting ways mixed up.

2:27:06.360 --> 2:27:08.960
 And maybe this pandemic wasn't sufficiently dangerous

2:27:08.960 --> 2:27:12.960
 to where that could have created a weird like an instability,

2:27:12.960 --> 2:27:15.120
 but maybe other things might create instability.

2:27:15.120 --> 2:27:17.000
 Like somebody, God forbid,

2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:19.160
 detonates a nuclear weapon somewhere.

2:27:19.160 --> 2:27:21.520
 And then maybe the destructive aspect of that

2:27:21.520 --> 2:27:24.880
 would not as much be the military actions,

2:27:24.880 --> 2:27:28.040
 but the way those news are spread on Twitter

2:27:28.040 --> 2:27:29.280
 and the panic that creates.

2:27:29.280 --> 2:27:30.400
 Yeah, yeah.

2:27:30.400 --> 2:27:32.320
 I mean, I think that's a great case study, right?

2:27:32.320 --> 2:27:34.040
 Like what happened, not,

2:27:34.040 --> 2:27:36.720
 but I'm not suggesting that Lexi go let off a nuclear bomb.

2:27:36.720 --> 2:27:39.880
 I meant the coronavirus, but yeah,

2:27:39.880 --> 2:27:43.000
 I think that's a really interesting case study.

2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:46.040
 I'm interested in the counterfactual of 1995,

2:27:46.040 --> 2:27:48.360
 like do the same virus in 1995.

2:27:48.360 --> 2:27:50.440
 So first of all, it would have been,

2:27:50.440 --> 2:27:53.560
 I get to hear whatever the nightly news,

2:27:53.560 --> 2:27:54.480
 we'll talk about it.

2:27:54.480 --> 2:27:57.280
 And then there'll be my local health board,

2:27:57.280 --> 2:27:58.320
 we'll talk about it.

2:27:58.320 --> 2:28:01.560
 That mitigation decisions would probably necessarily be

2:28:01.560 --> 2:28:04.320
 very sort of localized.

2:28:04.320 --> 2:28:05.480
 Okay, our community is trying to figure out

2:28:05.480 --> 2:28:06.320
 what are we gonna do?

2:28:06.320 --> 2:28:07.160
 What's gonna happen?

2:28:07.160 --> 2:28:08.080
 Like we see this with schools,

2:28:08.080 --> 2:28:10.400
 like where I grew up in New Jersey,

2:28:10.400 --> 2:28:12.800
 there's very localized school districts.

2:28:12.800 --> 2:28:15.040
 So even though they had sort of

2:28:15.040 --> 2:28:16.280
 really bad viral numbers there,

2:28:16.280 --> 2:28:18.320
 my school I grew up in has been open since the fall

2:28:18.320 --> 2:28:20.160
 because it's very localized.

2:28:20.160 --> 2:28:21.640
 It's like these teachers and these parents,

2:28:21.640 --> 2:28:22.480
 what do we wanna do?

2:28:22.480 --> 2:28:23.680
 What are we comfortable with?

2:28:23.680 --> 2:28:26.440
 I live in a school district right now in Montgomery County

2:28:26.440 --> 2:28:27.960
 that's a billion dollar a year budget,

2:28:27.960 --> 2:28:29.960
 150,000 kid school district.

2:28:29.960 --> 2:28:32.680
 It just can't, it's closed because it's too.

2:28:32.680 --> 2:28:33.880
 So I'm interested in that counterfactual.

2:28:33.880 --> 2:28:36.400
 Yeah, so you have all this information moving around

2:28:36.400 --> 2:28:39.160
 and then you have the effects on discourse

2:28:39.160 --> 2:28:40.480
 that we were talking about earlier,

2:28:40.480 --> 2:28:43.480
 that the Neil Postman style effects of Twitter,

2:28:43.480 --> 2:28:46.160
 which shifts people into a sort of a dunk culture mindset

2:28:46.160 --> 2:28:49.840
 of don't give an inch to the other team.

2:28:49.840 --> 2:28:51.680
 And we're used to this and was fired up by politics

2:28:51.680 --> 2:28:53.440
 and the unique attributes of Twitter.

2:28:53.440 --> 2:28:54.720
 Now throw in the coronavirus

2:28:54.720 --> 2:28:58.440
 and suddenly we see decades of public health knowledge,

2:28:58.440 --> 2:29:00.920
 a lot of which was honed during the HIV epidemic,

2:29:00.920 --> 2:29:02.280
 was thrown out the window

2:29:02.280 --> 2:29:04.120
 because a lot of this was happening on Twitter

2:29:04.120 --> 2:29:06.160
 and suddenly we had public health officials

2:29:06.160 --> 2:29:08.680
 using a don't give an inch to the other team mindset

2:29:08.680 --> 2:29:10.520
 of like, well, if we say this,

2:29:10.520 --> 2:29:12.920
 that might validate something that was wrong over here

2:29:12.920 --> 2:29:14.120
 and we need to, if we say this,

2:29:14.120 --> 2:29:16.360
 then maybe like that'll stop them from doing this.

2:29:16.360 --> 2:29:19.720
 That's like very Twittery in a way that in 1995

2:29:19.720 --> 2:29:22.560
 is probably not the way public health officials

2:29:22.560 --> 2:29:23.400
 would be thinking.

2:29:23.400 --> 2:29:25.240
 Where now it's like, well, this is,

2:29:25.240 --> 2:29:26.480
 if we said this about masks,

2:29:26.480 --> 2:29:28.080
 but the other team said that about masks,

2:29:28.080 --> 2:29:29.240
 we can't give an inch to this.

2:29:29.240 --> 2:29:30.200
 So we gotta be careful.

2:29:30.200 --> 2:29:31.600
 And like, we can't tell people it's okay

2:29:31.600 --> 2:29:33.560
 after they're vaccinated because that might,

2:29:33.560 --> 2:29:34.600
 we're giving them an inch on this

2:29:34.600 --> 2:29:36.760
 and that's very Twittery in my mind, right?

2:29:36.760 --> 2:29:39.360
 That is the impact of Twitter

2:29:39.360 --> 2:29:40.600
 on the way we think about discourse,

2:29:40.600 --> 2:29:41.600
 which is a dunking culture

2:29:41.600 --> 2:29:43.120
 of don't give any inch to the other team

2:29:43.120 --> 2:29:44.360
 and it's all about slam dunks

2:29:44.360 --> 2:29:46.400
 where you're completely right and they're completely wrong.

2:29:46.400 --> 2:29:49.000
 It's as a rhetorical strategy, it's incredibly simplistic,

2:29:49.000 --> 2:29:50.760
 but it's also the way that we think right now

2:29:50.760 --> 2:29:52.480
 about how we do debate.

2:29:52.480 --> 2:29:56.320
 It combined terribly with election year pandemic.

2:29:56.320 --> 2:29:58.240
 Yeah, election year pandemic.

2:29:58.240 --> 2:30:00.040
 I wonder if we could do some smooth analysis.

2:30:00.040 --> 2:30:01.800
 Let's run the simulation over a few times.

2:30:01.800 --> 2:30:03.600
 A little bit of noise, yeah.

2:30:03.600 --> 2:30:05.760
 See if it can dramatically change

2:30:05.760 --> 2:30:07.240
 the behavior of the system.

2:30:07.240 --> 2:30:09.040
 Okay, we talked about your love

2:30:09.040 --> 2:30:11.760
 for proving that something is impossible.

2:30:11.760 --> 2:30:14.360
 So there's quite a few still open problems

2:30:14.360 --> 2:30:17.440
 and complexity of algorithms.

2:30:17.440 --> 2:30:20.800
 So let me ask, does P equal NP?

2:30:20.800 --> 2:30:22.040
 Probably not.

2:30:22.040 --> 2:30:23.360
 Probably not.

2:30:23.360 --> 2:30:28.360
 If P equals NP, what kind of,

2:30:29.240 --> 2:30:32.440
 and you'd be really surprised somebody proves it.

2:30:32.440 --> 2:30:33.960
 What would that proof look like

2:30:33.960 --> 2:30:35.080
 and why would that even be?

2:30:35.080 --> 2:30:36.480
 What would that mean?

2:30:36.480 --> 2:30:38.320
 What would that proof look like?

2:30:38.320 --> 2:30:40.840
 And what possible universe could P equals NP?

2:30:40.840 --> 2:30:43.440
 Is there something in size that you could say there?

2:30:43.440 --> 2:30:45.440
 It could be true.

2:30:45.440 --> 2:30:47.280
 I mean, I'm not a complexity theorist,

2:30:47.280 --> 2:30:49.520
 but every complexity theorist I know

2:30:49.520 --> 2:30:51.440
 is convinced they're not equal

2:30:51.440 --> 2:30:53.120
 and are basically not working on it anymore.

2:30:53.120 --> 2:30:54.480
 I mean, there is a million dollars at stake

2:30:54.480 --> 2:30:55.920
 if you can solve the proof.

2:30:55.920 --> 2:30:57.800
 It's one of the millennium prizes.

2:30:57.800 --> 2:31:00.840
 Okay, so here's how I think the P not equals NP proof

2:31:00.840 --> 2:31:02.800
 is gonna eventually happen.

2:31:02.800 --> 2:31:04.520
 I think it's gonna fall out

2:31:04.520 --> 2:31:07.360
 and it's gonna be not super simple,

2:31:07.360 --> 2:31:08.720
 but not as hard as people think,

2:31:08.720 --> 2:31:12.200
 because my theory about a lot of theoretical computer science

2:31:12.200 --> 2:31:13.960
 based on just some results I've done,

2:31:13.960 --> 2:31:15.440
 so this is a huge extrapolation,

2:31:15.440 --> 2:31:17.200
 is that a lot of what we're doing

2:31:17.200 --> 2:31:20.840
 is just obfuscating deeper mathematics.

2:31:20.840 --> 2:31:22.680
 So this happens to me a lot, not a lot,

2:31:22.680 --> 2:31:24.320
 but it's happened to me a few times in my work

2:31:24.320 --> 2:31:26.240
 where we obfuscate it because we say,

2:31:26.240 --> 2:31:29.280
 well, there's an algorithm and it has this much memory

2:31:29.280 --> 2:31:30.640
 and they're connected on a network

2:31:30.640 --> 2:31:31.760
 and okay, here's our setup

2:31:31.760 --> 2:31:34.480
 and now we're trying to see how fast it can solve a problem

2:31:34.480 --> 2:31:35.960
 and people do bounds about it

2:31:35.960 --> 2:31:37.040
 and then the end it turns out

2:31:37.040 --> 2:31:39.320
 that we were just obfuscating some underlying

2:31:40.680 --> 2:31:43.520
 mathematical thing that already existed, right?

2:31:43.520 --> 2:31:44.400
 So this has happened to me.

2:31:44.400 --> 2:31:47.400
 I had this paper I was quite fond of a while ago.

2:31:47.400 --> 2:31:50.560
 It was looking at this problem called contention resolution

2:31:50.560 --> 2:31:54.520
 where you put an unknown set of people on a shared channel

2:31:54.520 --> 2:31:55.720
 and they're trying to break symmetry.

2:31:55.720 --> 2:31:57.720
 So it's like an ethernet, whatever.

2:31:57.720 --> 2:31:58.920
 Only one person can use it at a time.

2:31:58.920 --> 2:31:59.760
 You try to break symmetry.

2:31:59.760 --> 2:32:02.360
 There's all these bounds people have proven over the years

2:32:02.360 --> 2:32:05.040
 about how long it takes to do this, right?

2:32:05.040 --> 2:32:07.440
 And like I discovered at some point,

2:32:07.440 --> 2:32:12.440
 there's this one combinatorial result from the early 1990s.

2:32:12.640 --> 2:32:15.440
 All of these lower bound proofs all come from this

2:32:15.440 --> 2:32:16.840
 and in fact, it improved a lot of them

2:32:16.840 --> 2:32:17.680
 and simplified a lot.

2:32:17.680 --> 2:32:19.800
 You could put it all in one paper.

2:32:19.800 --> 2:32:20.640
 It's like, are we really?

2:32:20.640 --> 2:32:21.920
 And then, okay, so this new paper

2:32:21.920 --> 2:32:24.200
 that I submitted a couple of weeks ago,

2:32:24.200 --> 2:32:26.440
 I found you could take some of these same lower bound proofs

2:32:26.440 --> 2:32:28.080
 for this contention resolution problem.

2:32:28.080 --> 2:32:29.720
 You could reprove them.

2:32:29.720 --> 2:32:32.280
 Using Shannon's source code theorem

2:32:32.280 --> 2:32:34.080
 that actually when you're breaking contention,

2:32:34.080 --> 2:32:37.360
 what you're really doing is building a code over,

2:32:38.360 --> 2:32:40.520
 if you have a distribution on the network sizes,

2:32:40.520 --> 2:32:41.720
 it's a code over that source.

2:32:41.720 --> 2:32:44.440
 And if you plug in a high entropy information source

2:32:44.440 --> 2:32:47.480
 and plug in from 1948, the source code theorem

2:32:47.480 --> 2:32:48.720
 that says on a noiseless channel,

2:32:48.720 --> 2:32:51.080
 you can't send things at a faster rate

2:32:51.080 --> 2:32:52.440
 than the entropy allows,

2:32:52.440 --> 2:32:54.440
 the exact same lower bounds fall back out again, right?

2:32:54.440 --> 2:32:55.840
 So like this type of thing happens.

2:32:55.840 --> 2:32:58.720
 There's some famous lower bounds and distributed algorithms

2:32:58.720 --> 2:33:01.600
 that turned out to all be algebraic topology

2:33:01.600 --> 2:33:02.760
 underneath the covers.

2:33:02.760 --> 2:33:05.560
 And they won the Girdle Prize for working on that.

2:33:05.560 --> 2:33:08.400
 So my sense is what's gonna happen is at some point,

2:33:08.400 --> 2:33:11.000
 someone really smart to be very exciting

2:33:11.000 --> 2:33:14.760
 is gonna realize there's some sort of other representation

2:33:14.760 --> 2:33:16.840
 of what's going on with these Turing machines

2:33:16.840 --> 2:33:18.680
 trying to sort of efficiently compute.

2:33:18.680 --> 2:33:22.120
 And there'll be an existing mathematical result

2:33:22.120 --> 2:33:23.880
 that apply.

2:33:23.880 --> 2:33:25.360
 Someone or something, I guess.

2:33:25.360 --> 2:33:28.040
 It could be AI theorem provers kind of thing.

2:33:28.040 --> 2:33:28.880
 It could be, yeah.

2:33:28.880 --> 2:33:30.520
 I mean, not a, well, yeah.

2:33:30.520 --> 2:33:31.760
 I mean, there's theorem provers,

2:33:31.760 --> 2:33:35.440
 like what that means now, which is not fun.

2:33:35.440 --> 2:33:37.040
 It's just a bunch of...

2:33:37.040 --> 2:33:39.280
 Very carefully formulated postulates that,

2:33:39.280 --> 2:33:41.320
 but I take your point, yeah.

2:33:41.320 --> 2:33:42.720
 Yeah, so, okay.

2:33:44.520 --> 2:33:45.920
 On a small tangent on that,

2:33:45.920 --> 2:33:49.000
 then you're kind of implying that mathematics,

2:33:49.000 --> 2:33:52.520
 it almost feels like a kind of weird evolutionary tree

2:33:52.520 --> 2:33:55.400
 that ultimately leads back to some kind of ancestral,

2:33:55.400 --> 2:33:58.840
 few fundamental ideas that all are just like,

2:33:58.840 --> 2:34:00.360
 they're all somehow connected.

2:34:01.680 --> 2:34:02.960
 In that sense, do you think

2:34:04.840 --> 2:34:07.000
 math is fundamental to our universe

2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:10.960
 and we're just like slowly trying to understand

2:34:10.960 --> 2:34:14.280
 these patterns or is it discovered?

2:34:15.240 --> 2:34:19.920
 Or is it just a little game that we play amongst ourselves

2:34:19.920 --> 2:34:23.680
 to try to fit little patterns to the world?

2:34:23.680 --> 2:34:24.880
 Yeah, that's the question, right?

2:34:24.880 --> 2:34:26.840
 That's the physicist question.

2:34:26.840 --> 2:34:29.120
 I mean, I'm probably, I'm in the discovered camp,

2:34:29.120 --> 2:34:30.720
 but I don't do theoretical physics.

2:34:30.720 --> 2:34:32.400
 So I know they have a,

2:34:33.320 --> 2:34:35.200
 they feel like they have a stronger claim

2:34:35.200 --> 2:34:37.280
 to answering that question.

2:34:37.280 --> 2:34:38.480
 But everything comes back to it.

2:34:38.480 --> 2:34:39.520
 Everything comes back to it.

2:34:39.520 --> 2:34:40.680
 I mean, all the physics,

2:34:40.680 --> 2:34:43.920
 the fact that the universe is, well, okay.

2:34:45.800 --> 2:34:47.200
 It's a complicated question.

2:34:47.200 --> 2:34:49.280
 So how often do you think,

2:34:49.280 --> 2:34:53.040
 how deeply does this result describe

2:34:53.040 --> 2:34:55.720
 the fundamental reality of nature?

2:34:57.080 --> 2:34:59.720
 So the reason I hesitated,

2:34:59.720 --> 2:35:01.080
 because it's something I'm,

2:35:01.080 --> 2:35:03.080
 I taught this seminar and did a little work

2:35:03.080 --> 2:35:05.000
 on what are called biological algorithms.

2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:07.480
 So there's this notion of,

2:35:09.360 --> 2:35:14.360
 so physicists use mathematics to explain the universe, right?

2:35:14.400 --> 2:35:18.200
 And it was unreasonable that mathematics works so well.

2:35:18.200 --> 2:35:19.760
 All these differential equations,

2:35:19.760 --> 2:35:21.680
 why does that explain all we need to know

2:35:21.680 --> 2:35:23.040
 about thermodynamics and gravity

2:35:23.040 --> 2:35:24.240
 and all these types of things?

2:35:24.240 --> 2:35:25.560
 Well, there's this movement

2:35:25.560 --> 2:35:28.680
 within the intersection of computer science and biology,

2:35:28.680 --> 2:35:31.160
 just kind of Wolframium, I guess, really,

2:35:31.160 --> 2:35:35.040
 that algorithms can be very explanatory, right?

2:35:35.040 --> 2:35:39.440
 Like if you're trying to explain parsimoniously

2:35:39.440 --> 2:35:41.840
 something about like an ant colony or something like this,

2:35:41.840 --> 2:35:43.160
 you're not going to,

2:35:43.160 --> 2:35:45.840
 ultimately it's not gonna be explained as a equation,

2:35:45.840 --> 2:35:46.840
 like a physics equation.

2:35:46.840 --> 2:35:48.280
 It's gonna be explained by an algorithm.

2:35:48.280 --> 2:35:51.920
 So like this algorithm run distributedly

2:35:51.920 --> 2:35:53.240
 is going to explain the behavior.

2:35:53.240 --> 2:35:56.160
 So that's mathematical, but not quite mathematical,

2:35:56.160 --> 2:35:57.640
 but it is if you think about an algorithm

2:35:57.640 --> 2:35:58.680
 like a Lambda calculus,

2:35:58.680 --> 2:36:01.040
 which brings you back to the world of mathematics.

2:36:01.040 --> 2:36:01.960
 So I'm thinking out loud here,

2:36:01.960 --> 2:36:06.960
 but basically abstract math is sort of like

2:36:07.040 --> 2:36:10.440
 unreasonably effective at explaining a lot of things.

2:36:10.440 --> 2:36:11.840
 And that's just what I feel like I glimpse.

2:36:11.840 --> 2:36:14.960
 I'm not like a super well known theoretician.

2:36:14.960 --> 2:36:16.960
 I don't have really famous results.

2:36:16.960 --> 2:36:21.880
 So even as a sort of middling career theoretician,

2:36:21.880 --> 2:36:25.920
 I keep encountering this where we think we're solving

2:36:25.920 --> 2:36:28.640
 some problem about computers and algorithms,

2:36:28.640 --> 2:36:31.040
 and it's some much deeper underlying math.

2:36:31.040 --> 2:36:33.240
 It's Shannon, but Shannon is entropy,

2:36:33.240 --> 2:36:36.840
 but entropy was really goes all the way back

2:36:36.840 --> 2:36:38.380
 to whatever it was,

2:36:38.380 --> 2:36:40.680
 Boyle or all the way back to looking at the early physics.

2:36:40.680 --> 2:36:44.960
 And it's, anyways, to me, I think it's amazing.

2:36:44.960 --> 2:36:47.760
 Yeah, but it could be the flip side of that could be

2:36:47.760 --> 2:36:49.480
 just our brains draw so much pleasure

2:36:49.480 --> 2:36:53.240
 from the deriving generalized theories

2:36:53.240 --> 2:36:56.680
 and simplifying the universe that we just naturally see

2:36:56.680 --> 2:36:58.680
 that kind of simplicity in everything.

2:36:58.680 --> 2:37:01.880
 Yeah, so that's the whole Newton to Einstein, right?

2:37:01.880 --> 2:37:03.600
 So you can say this must be right

2:37:03.600 --> 2:37:04.960
 because it's so predictive.

2:37:04.960 --> 2:37:06.440
 Well, it's not quite predictive

2:37:06.440 --> 2:37:07.720
 because Mercury wobbles a little bit,

2:37:07.720 --> 2:37:08.680
 but I think we have it set

2:37:08.680 --> 2:37:10.780
 and then you turn out, no, Einstein.

2:37:10.780 --> 2:37:13.920
 And then you get Bohr like, no, not Einstein.

2:37:13.920 --> 2:37:15.160
 It's actually statistical.

2:37:15.160 --> 2:37:16.600
 And yeah, so that would be interesting.

2:37:16.600 --> 2:37:17.800
 It's hard to also know

2:37:17.800 --> 2:37:20.320
 where a smooth analysis fits into all that

2:37:20.320 --> 2:37:21.560
 or a little bit of noise.

2:37:21.560 --> 2:37:25.720
 Like you can say something very clean about a system

2:37:25.720 --> 2:37:27.440
 and then a little bit of noise,

2:37:27.440 --> 2:37:29.880
 like the average case is actually very different.

2:37:29.880 --> 2:37:31.720
 And so, I mean, that's where

2:37:31.720 --> 2:37:32.920
 the quantum mechanics comes in.

2:37:32.920 --> 2:37:36.200
 It's like, ugh, why does it have to be randomness in this?

2:37:36.200 --> 2:37:38.720
 Yeah, I would have to do this complex statistics.

2:37:38.720 --> 2:37:39.560
 Yeah. Yeah.

2:37:41.240 --> 2:37:42.600
 So to be determined.

2:37:42.600 --> 2:37:44.000
 Yeah, that'll be my next book.

2:37:44.000 --> 2:37:45.600
 That'd be ambitious.

2:37:45.600 --> 2:37:50.040
 The fundamental core of reality, comma,

2:37:50.040 --> 2:37:52.440
 and some advice for being more productive at work.

2:37:53.760 --> 2:37:55.280
 Can I ask you just,

2:37:55.280 --> 2:37:57.120
 if it's possible to do an overview

2:37:57.120 --> 2:38:00.480
 and just some brief comments of wisdom

2:38:00.480 --> 2:38:02.960
 on the process of publishing a book,

2:38:02.960 --> 2:38:04.120
 what's that process entail?

2:38:04.120 --> 2:38:05.480
 What are the different options

2:38:05.480 --> 2:38:07.000
 and what's your recommendation

2:38:08.440 --> 2:38:12.440
 for somebody that wants to write a book like yours,

2:38:12.440 --> 2:38:14.840
 a nonfiction book that discovers

2:38:14.840 --> 2:38:17.800
 something interesting about this world?

2:38:17.800 --> 2:38:22.800
 So what I usually advise is follow the process as is.

2:38:25.560 --> 2:38:27.280
 Don't try to reinvent.

2:38:27.280 --> 2:38:31.480
 I think that happens a lot where you'll try to reinvent

2:38:31.480 --> 2:38:33.000
 the way the publishing industry should work.

2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:36.280
 Like this is kind of not like in a business model ways,

2:38:36.280 --> 2:38:38.200
 but just like, this is what I want to do.

2:38:38.200 --> 2:38:39.680
 I want to write a thousand words a day

2:38:39.680 --> 2:38:41.800
 and I want to do this and I'm gonna put it on the internet

2:38:41.800 --> 2:38:44.680
 and the publishing industry is very specific

2:38:44.680 --> 2:38:46.320
 about how it works.

2:38:46.320 --> 2:38:47.880
 And so like when I got started writing books,

2:38:47.880 --> 2:38:48.840
 which at a very young age,

2:38:48.840 --> 2:38:52.320
 so I sold my first book at the age of 21.

2:38:52.320 --> 2:38:56.320
 The way I did that is I found a family friend

2:38:56.320 --> 2:38:58.920
 that was an agent and I said,

2:38:58.920 --> 2:39:00.560
 I'm not trying to make you be my agent.

2:39:00.560 --> 2:39:02.240
 Just explain to me how this works.

2:39:02.240 --> 2:39:03.360
 Not just how the world works,

2:39:03.360 --> 2:39:06.680
 but give me the hard truth about how would a 21 year old,

2:39:06.680 --> 2:39:08.800
 under what conditions could a 21 year old sell a book

2:39:08.800 --> 2:39:09.640
 and what would that look like?

2:39:09.640 --> 2:39:10.600
 And she just explained it to me.

2:39:10.600 --> 2:39:12.400
 You know, you have to do this and have to be a subject

2:39:12.400 --> 2:39:14.040
 that it made sense for you to write.

2:39:14.040 --> 2:39:15.360
 And you would have to do this type of writing

2:39:15.360 --> 2:39:17.600
 for the publications to validate it and blah, blah, blah.

2:39:17.600 --> 2:39:18.760
 And you have to get the agent first.

2:39:18.760 --> 2:39:22.280
 And I learned the whole game plan and then I executed.

2:39:22.280 --> 2:39:24.720
 And so the rough game plan is with nonfiction,

2:39:24.720 --> 2:39:26.480
 you get the agent first

2:39:26.480 --> 2:39:28.760
 and the agent's gonna sell it to the publishers.

2:39:28.760 --> 2:39:30.240
 So like you're never sending something directly

2:39:30.240 --> 2:39:31.080
 to the publishers.

2:39:31.080 --> 2:39:34.320
 In nonfiction, you're not writing the book first, right?

2:39:34.320 --> 2:39:37.280
 You're gonna get an advance from the publisher once sold

2:39:37.280 --> 2:39:40.200
 and then you're gonna do the primary writing of the book.

2:39:40.200 --> 2:39:42.720
 In fact, it will, in most circumstances, hurt you

2:39:42.720 --> 2:39:43.560
 if you've already written it.

2:39:43.560 --> 2:39:44.400
 If you've already written it.

2:39:44.400 --> 2:39:45.240
 Yeah.

2:39:45.240 --> 2:39:47.200
 So you're trying to sell, well, I guess the agent,

2:39:47.200 --> 2:39:48.040
 first you sell it to the agent

2:39:48.040 --> 2:39:50.120
 and then the agent sells it to the publishers.

2:39:50.120 --> 2:39:52.360
 It's much easier to get an agent than a book deal.

2:39:52.360 --> 2:39:54.440
 So the thought is, if you can't get an agent,

2:39:54.440 --> 2:39:55.280
 then why would you?

2:39:55.280 --> 2:39:57.880
 So you start with, and also the way this works

2:39:57.880 --> 2:40:00.480
 with a good agent is they know all the editors

2:40:00.480 --> 2:40:01.520
 and they have lunch with the editors

2:40:01.520 --> 2:40:02.360
 and they're always just like,

2:40:02.360 --> 2:40:03.240
 okay, what projects do you have coming?

2:40:03.240 --> 2:40:04.080
 What are you looking for?

2:40:04.080 --> 2:40:04.900
 Here's one of my authors.

2:40:04.900 --> 2:40:06.080
 That's the way all these deals happen.

2:40:06.080 --> 2:40:09.520
 It's not, you're not emailing a manuscript to a slush pile.

2:40:09.520 --> 2:40:12.320
 Yeah, and so first of all, the agent takes a percentage

2:40:12.320 --> 2:40:14.680
 and then the publishers, this is where the process comes in.

2:40:14.680 --> 2:40:17.880
 They take also a cut that's probably ridiculous.

2:40:17.880 --> 2:40:21.000
 So if you try to reinvent the system,

2:40:21.000 --> 2:40:22.800
 you'll probably be frustrated by the percentage

2:40:22.800 --> 2:40:25.320
 that everyone takes relative to how much bureaucracy

2:40:25.320 --> 2:40:28.240
 and efficiency ridiculousness there is in the system.

2:40:28.240 --> 2:40:31.640
 Your recommendation is like, you're just one ant.

2:40:31.640 --> 2:40:34.400
 Stop trying to build your own ant colony.

2:40:34.400 --> 2:40:36.840
 Well, or if you create your own process

2:40:36.840 --> 2:40:38.440
 for how it should work,

2:40:38.440 --> 2:40:39.480
 the book's not gonna get published.

2:40:39.480 --> 2:40:40.840
 So there's the separate question,

2:40:40.840 --> 2:40:41.920
 the economic question of like,

2:40:41.920 --> 2:40:44.560
 should I create my own, like self publish it

2:40:44.560 --> 2:40:45.400
 or do something like that?

2:40:45.400 --> 2:40:47.080
 But putting that aside,

2:40:47.080 --> 2:40:48.860
 there's a lot of people I encounter

2:40:48.860 --> 2:40:51.320
 that wanna publish a book with a main publisher,

2:40:51.320 --> 2:40:54.080
 but they invent their own rules for how it works, right?

2:40:54.080 --> 2:40:56.400
 So then the alternative though is self publishing

2:40:56.400 --> 2:41:00.440
 and the downside, there's a lot of downsides.

2:41:00.440 --> 2:41:03.080
 It's almost like publishing an opinion piece

2:41:03.080 --> 2:41:05.560
 in the New York Times versus writing on a blog.

2:41:05.560 --> 2:41:09.520
 There's no reason why writing a blog post on Medium

2:41:09.520 --> 2:41:13.560
 can't get way more attention and legitimacy

2:41:13.560 --> 2:41:16.800
 and long lasting prestige than a New York Times article.

2:41:16.800 --> 2:41:18.920
 But nevertheless, for most people,

2:41:18.920 --> 2:41:21.220
 writing in a prestigious newspaper,

2:41:21.220 --> 2:41:25.820
 quote unquote prestigious, is just easier.

2:41:26.640 --> 2:41:29.060
 And well, and depends on your goal.

2:41:29.060 --> 2:41:32.240
 So, you know, like I push you towards a big publisher

2:41:32.240 --> 2:41:36.080
 because I think your goal, it's huge ideas, you want impact.

2:41:36.080 --> 2:41:37.920
 You're gonna have more impact.

2:41:37.920 --> 2:41:39.880
 Even though, like actually,

2:41:39.880 --> 2:41:41.880
 so there's different ways to measure impact, right?

2:41:41.880 --> 2:41:42.800
 In the world of ideas.

2:41:42.800 --> 2:41:44.200
 In the world of ideas.

2:41:44.200 --> 2:41:46.480
 And also, yeah, in the world of ideas,

2:41:46.480 --> 2:41:48.960
 it's kind of like the clubhouse thing now,

2:41:48.960 --> 2:41:51.200
 even if the audience is not large,

2:41:51.200 --> 2:41:53.600
 the people in the audience are very interesting.

2:41:54.760 --> 2:41:56.880
 It's like the conversation feels like

2:41:56.880 --> 2:42:01.500
 that has long lasting impact among the people

2:42:01.500 --> 2:42:03.720
 in different and disparate industries

2:42:03.720 --> 2:42:06.540
 that are also then starting their own conversations

2:42:06.540 --> 2:42:07.380
 and all that kind of stuff.

2:42:07.380 --> 2:42:09.040
 Yeah, because you have other,

2:42:09.040 --> 2:42:11.080
 so like self publishing a book,

2:42:12.160 --> 2:42:13.260
 the goals that would solve,

2:42:13.260 --> 2:42:15.340
 you have much better ways of getting to those goals,

2:42:15.340 --> 2:42:16.220
 might be part of it, right?

2:42:16.220 --> 2:42:17.880
 So if there's the financial aspect

2:42:17.880 --> 2:42:19.560
 of well, you get to keep more of it,

2:42:19.560 --> 2:42:22.420
 I mean, the podcast is probably gonna crush

2:42:22.420 --> 2:42:23.600
 what the book's gonna do anyways, right?

2:42:23.600 --> 2:42:27.240
 Yeah, if it's, I wanna get directly

2:42:27.240 --> 2:42:28.760
 to certain audiences or crowds,

2:42:28.760 --> 2:42:30.560
 it might be harder through a traditional publisher.

2:42:30.560 --> 2:42:32.520
 There's better ways to talk to those crowds.

2:42:32.520 --> 2:42:34.680
 It could be on clubhouse with all these new technologies,

2:42:34.680 --> 2:42:36.880
 self published books not gonna be the most effective way

2:42:36.880 --> 2:42:39.200
 to find your way to a new crowd.

2:42:39.200 --> 2:42:40.560
 But if the idea is like, I wanna have a,

2:42:40.560 --> 2:42:43.600
 leave a dent in the world of ideas,

2:42:43.600 --> 2:42:47.200
 then to have a vulnerable old publisher,

2:42:47.200 --> 2:42:49.140
 put out your book in a nice hardcover

2:42:49.140 --> 2:42:52.760
 and do the things they do, that goes a long way.

2:42:52.760 --> 2:42:53.700
 And they do do a lot.

2:42:53.700 --> 2:42:55.680
 I mean, it's very difficult actually.

2:42:55.680 --> 2:42:57.800
 There's so much involved in putting together a book.

2:42:57.800 --> 2:42:59.160
 They get books into bookstores

2:42:59.160 --> 2:42:59.980
 and all that kind of stuff.

2:42:59.980 --> 2:43:02.560
 And from an efficiency standpoint,

2:43:02.560 --> 2:43:03.800
 I mean, just the time involved

2:43:03.800 --> 2:43:05.600
 in trying to do this yourself is.

2:43:05.600 --> 2:43:06.800
 They have a process, right?

2:43:06.800 --> 2:43:08.440
 Like you said, they have a process.

2:43:08.440 --> 2:43:09.280
 They've got a process.

2:43:09.280 --> 2:43:11.080
 I mean, I know like Jocko did this recently,

2:43:11.080 --> 2:43:13.080
 he started his own imprint and I have a couple other.

2:43:13.080 --> 2:43:15.040
 But it's a huge overhead.

2:43:15.040 --> 2:43:17.240
 I mean, if you run a business and you,

2:43:17.240 --> 2:43:19.300
 so like Jocko is a good case study, right?

2:43:19.300 --> 2:43:22.440
 So he got fed up with Simon and Schuster

2:43:22.440 --> 2:43:23.600
 dragging their feet and said,

2:43:23.600 --> 2:43:25.240
 I'm gonna start my own imprint then,

2:43:25.240 --> 2:43:28.120
 if you're not gonna publish my kid's book.

2:43:28.120 --> 2:43:30.800
 But he, what does he do, he runs businesses, right?

2:43:30.800 --> 2:43:32.760
 So I think in his world, like I already run,

2:43:32.760 --> 2:43:34.900
 I'm a partner in whatever, in Origin,

2:43:34.900 --> 2:43:35.740
 and I have this and that.

2:43:35.740 --> 2:43:37.720
 And so it's like, yeah, we can run businesses.

2:43:37.720 --> 2:43:38.560
 That's what we know how to do.

2:43:38.560 --> 2:43:39.400
 That's what I do.

2:43:39.400 --> 2:43:40.520
 I run businesses, I have people.

2:43:40.520 --> 2:43:43.160
 But for like you or I, we don't run businesses.

2:43:43.160 --> 2:43:44.000
 It'd be terrible.

2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:47.420
 Yeah, well, especially these kinds of businesses, right?

2:43:47.420 --> 2:43:49.600
 So I do wanna launch a business with very different

2:43:49.600 --> 2:43:50.440
 technology business.

2:43:50.440 --> 2:43:51.280
 It's very different.

2:43:51.280 --> 2:43:53.320
 Yeah, it's very, very different, yeah.

2:43:53.320 --> 2:43:55.760
 I mean, this is like, okay, I need copy editors

2:43:55.760 --> 2:43:58.680
 and graphic book binders, and I need to contract

2:43:58.680 --> 2:44:00.760
 with the printer, but oh, the printer doesn't have slots.

2:44:00.760 --> 2:44:02.800
 And so now I have to try to, I mean, it's.

2:44:02.800 --> 2:44:05.720
 I get so, I need to shut this off in my room,

2:44:05.720 --> 2:44:07.220
 but I get so frustrated when the system

2:44:07.220 --> 2:44:08.620
 could clearly be improved.

2:44:08.620 --> 2:44:10.480
 It's the thing that you're mentioning.

2:44:10.480 --> 2:44:12.480
 It's like, this is so inefficient.

2:44:12.480 --> 2:44:15.640
 Every time I go to the DMV or something like that,

2:44:15.640 --> 2:44:18.760
 you think like, ah, this could be done so much better.

2:44:18.760 --> 2:44:23.760
 But, and the same thing as the worry with an editor,

2:44:23.760 --> 2:44:26.120
 which I guess would come from the publisher,

2:44:26.120 --> 2:44:31.120
 like who would, how much supervision on your book

2:44:31.260 --> 2:44:34.280
 did you receive like, hey, do you think this is too long?

2:44:34.280 --> 2:44:36.280
 Or do you think the title, like title,

2:44:36.280 --> 2:44:39.200
 how much choice do you have in the title, in the cover,

2:44:39.200 --> 2:44:41.200
 in the presentation and the branding

2:44:41.200 --> 2:44:42.040
 and all that kind of stuff?

2:44:42.040 --> 2:44:43.860
 Yeah, I mean, all of it depends, right?

2:44:43.860 --> 2:44:48.040
 So when it comes on the relationship with the editor

2:44:48.040 --> 2:44:49.520
 on the writing, it depends on the editor

2:44:49.520 --> 2:44:51.640
 and it depends on you.

2:44:51.640 --> 2:44:54.160
 So like at this point, I'm on my seventh book

2:44:54.160 --> 2:44:56.920
 and I write for a lot of major publications.

2:44:56.920 --> 2:45:00.240
 And at this point I have what I feel like is a voice

2:45:00.240 --> 2:45:03.920
 and a level of craft that I'm very comfortable with, right?

2:45:03.920 --> 2:45:06.020
 So my editor is not gonna be,

2:45:06.020 --> 2:45:07.100
 she kind of is gonna trust me

2:45:07.100 --> 2:45:08.320
 and it's gonna be more big picture.

2:45:08.320 --> 2:45:10.880
 Like I'm losing the thread here

2:45:10.880 --> 2:45:12.840
 or this seems like it could be longer.

2:45:12.840 --> 2:45:15.400
 Whereas the first book I wrote when I was 21,

2:45:15.400 --> 2:45:19.520
 I had notes such as you start a lot of sentences with so,

2:45:19.520 --> 2:45:20.960
 you don't use any contractions

2:45:20.960 --> 2:45:22.360
 because I've been doing scientific writing,

2:45:22.360 --> 2:45:23.440
 we don't use contractions.

2:45:23.440 --> 2:45:25.200
 Like you should probably use contractions.

2:45:25.200 --> 2:45:27.600
 It was way more, I had to go back

2:45:27.600 --> 2:45:29.640
 and rewrite the whole thing, yeah.

2:45:29.640 --> 2:45:31.960
 But ultimately the recommendation,

2:45:31.960 --> 2:45:33.720
 I mean, we talked offline and sort of,

2:45:33.720 --> 2:45:36.840
 I was thinking loosely, not really sure,

2:45:36.840 --> 2:45:37.960
 but I was thinking of writing a book

2:45:37.960 --> 2:45:40.640
 and there's a kind of desire to go self publishing,

2:45:40.640 --> 2:45:42.040
 not for financial reasons.

2:45:42.040 --> 2:45:43.360
 And the money can be good by the way, right?

2:45:43.360 --> 2:45:48.080
 I mean, it's very power law type distributed, right?

2:45:48.080 --> 2:45:49.840
 So the money on a hardcover is somewhere

2:45:49.840 --> 2:45:52.040
 between one or $2 a book.

2:45:52.040 --> 2:45:53.880
 So the thing is, I personally don't.

2:45:53.880 --> 2:45:56.040
 But then you give up 15% to the agent, so.

2:45:56.040 --> 2:45:57.420
 I personally don't care about money

2:45:57.420 --> 2:45:58.620
 as I've mentioned before,

2:45:58.620 --> 2:46:02.200
 but I for some reason really don't like spending money

2:46:03.280 --> 2:46:05.800
 on things that are not worth it.

2:46:05.800 --> 2:46:08.040
 Like I don't care if I get money,

2:46:08.040 --> 2:46:11.480
 I just don't like spending money on like feeding a system

2:46:11.480 --> 2:46:12.840
 that's inefficient.

2:46:12.840 --> 2:46:14.480
 It's like I'm contributing to the problem.

2:46:14.480 --> 2:46:16.080
 That's my biggest problem.

2:46:16.080 --> 2:46:18.640
 Right, so you're worried about the inefficiencies

2:46:18.640 --> 2:46:19.920
 of the opportunity.

2:46:19.920 --> 2:46:21.320
 Yeah, the fact that.

2:46:21.320 --> 2:46:23.080
 Like the overheads, the number of people involved.

2:46:23.080 --> 2:46:24.040
 Or the overheads.

2:46:24.040 --> 2:46:26.320
 The emails again.

2:46:26.320 --> 2:46:30.280
 The fact that they have this way of speaking,

2:46:30.280 --> 2:46:32.360
 which I'm allergic to many people,

2:46:32.360 --> 2:46:34.640
 like that's very marketing speak.

2:46:34.640 --> 2:46:36.180
 Like you could tell they've been having

2:46:36.180 --> 2:46:37.760
 Zoom meetings all day.

2:46:37.760 --> 2:46:42.760
 It's like as opposed to a sort of creative collaborators

2:46:43.280 --> 2:46:45.680
 that are like also a little bit crazy.

2:46:45.680 --> 2:46:46.520
 Yeah.

2:46:46.520 --> 2:46:48.160
 I suppose some of that is finding the right people.

2:46:48.160 --> 2:46:48.980
 Finding the right people.

2:46:48.980 --> 2:46:49.820
 That's what I would say.

2:46:49.820 --> 2:46:51.120
 I'd say there's definitely,

2:46:51.120 --> 2:46:52.760
 and maybe it's just good fortune.

2:46:53.640 --> 2:46:55.580
 Good fortune in terms of like my agents and editors

2:46:55.580 --> 2:46:56.420
 I've worked with.

2:46:56.420 --> 2:47:01.080
 There's really good people who see the vision

2:47:01.080 --> 2:47:02.400
 are smart or incredibly literary.

2:47:02.400 --> 2:47:03.220
 And they actually help you.

2:47:03.220 --> 2:47:04.060
 Yeah.

2:47:04.060 --> 2:47:05.080
 Like psychologically.

2:47:05.080 --> 2:47:06.800
 Yeah, I had a great editor when I was first moving

2:47:06.800 --> 2:47:08.720
 into hardcover books, for example.

2:47:08.720 --> 2:47:12.280
 It was my first big book advance

2:47:12.280 --> 2:47:14.640
 and my first sort of big deal

2:47:14.640 --> 2:47:16.640
 and he was like a senior editor

2:47:16.640 --> 2:47:19.200
 and it was very useful, you know?

2:47:19.200 --> 2:47:21.360
 He was like, we had a lot of long talks, right?

2:47:21.360 --> 2:47:23.080
 I was, so this was my fourth book,

2:47:23.080 --> 2:47:25.080
 So Good They Can't Ignore You was my first,

2:47:25.080 --> 2:47:26.660
 my big hardcover idea book.

2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:29.320
 And we had a lot of talks,

2:47:29.320 --> 2:47:31.060
 like even before I started writing it,

2:47:31.060 --> 2:47:34.040
 just let's talk about books and his philosophy.

2:47:34.040 --> 2:47:35.560
 He'd been in the business for a long time.

2:47:35.560 --> 2:47:37.080
 He was the head of the imprint.

2:47:37.080 --> 2:47:38.480
 It was useful.

2:47:38.480 --> 2:47:41.000
 Yeah, but I mean, the other frustrating thing

2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:42.600
 is how long the whole thing takes.

2:47:42.600 --> 2:47:44.240
 Makes a long time.

2:47:44.240 --> 2:47:45.080
 Yeah.

2:47:45.080 --> 2:47:46.320
 But I suppose that's, you just have to accept that.

2:47:46.320 --> 2:47:48.000
 Well, yeah, I handed in this manuscript

2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:50.400
 for the book that comes out now,

2:47:50.400 --> 2:47:52.320
 like when this, I handed it in,

2:47:52.320 --> 2:47:54.440
 I mean, over the summer, like during the pandemic.

2:47:54.440 --> 2:47:56.440
 So it's not, it's not terrible, right?

2:47:56.440 --> 2:47:57.920
 And we were editing during the pandemic

2:47:57.920 --> 2:48:00.460
 and I finished it in the spring.

2:48:00.460 --> 2:48:02.240
 We've talked most of the day,

2:48:02.240 --> 2:48:03.640
 except for a little bit computer science,

2:48:03.640 --> 2:48:05.680
 most of the day about a productive life.

2:48:07.360 --> 2:48:11.220
 How does love, friendship and family fit into that?

2:48:11.220 --> 2:48:16.180
 Is there, do you find that there's a tension?

2:48:17.580 --> 2:48:19.620
 Is it possible for relationships

2:48:19.620 --> 2:48:22.460
 to energize the whole process, to benefit?

2:48:22.460 --> 2:48:25.420
 Or is it ultimately a trade off?

2:48:25.420 --> 2:48:30.040
 But because life is short and ultimately

2:48:30.040 --> 2:48:32.780
 we seek happiness, not productivity,

2:48:32.780 --> 2:48:35.060
 that we have to accept that tension.

2:48:35.060 --> 2:48:36.300
 Yeah.

2:48:36.300 --> 2:48:39.220
 I mean, I think relationships is the,

2:48:39.220 --> 2:48:41.540
 that's the whole deal.

2:48:41.540 --> 2:48:43.780
 Like I thought about this the other day,

2:48:43.780 --> 2:48:44.700
 I don't know what the context was.

2:48:44.700 --> 2:48:46.180
 I was thinking about if I was gonna give

2:48:46.180 --> 2:48:49.060
 like an advice speech, like a commencement address

2:48:49.060 --> 2:48:51.700
 or like giving advice to young people.

2:48:51.700 --> 2:48:56.100
 And like the big question I have for young people is

2:48:56.100 --> 2:48:58.580
 if they haven't already, bad things are gonna happen

2:48:58.580 --> 2:49:01.820
 that you don't control, so what's the plan, right?

2:49:01.820 --> 2:49:03.580
 Like, let's start figuring that out now

2:49:03.580 --> 2:49:05.620
 because it's not all, you know,

2:49:05.620 --> 2:49:07.460
 some people get off better than others,

2:49:07.460 --> 2:49:09.980
 but eventually stuff happens, right?

2:49:09.980 --> 2:49:11.900
 You get sick, something falls apart,

2:49:11.900 --> 2:49:16.020
 the economy craters, someone you know dies,

2:49:16.020 --> 2:49:19.020
 like all sorts of bad stuff is gonna happen, right?

2:49:19.020 --> 2:49:20.660
 So how are we gonna do this?

2:49:20.660 --> 2:49:23.100
 Like, how do we like live life when life is hard?

2:49:23.100 --> 2:49:25.780
 And in ways that is unfair and unpredictable,

2:49:25.780 --> 2:49:27.860
 then relationships is the,

2:49:27.860 --> 2:49:30.420
 that's the buffer for all of that.

2:49:30.420 --> 2:49:31.540
 Cause we're wired for it, right?

2:49:31.540 --> 2:49:34.160
 I went down this rabbit hole with digital minimalism.

2:49:34.160 --> 2:49:35.420
 I went down this huge rabbit hole

2:49:35.420 --> 2:49:38.780
 about the human brain and sociality.

2:49:38.780 --> 2:49:39.780
 It's all we're wired to do.

2:49:39.780 --> 2:49:41.260
 It's like all of our brain is for this.

2:49:41.260 --> 2:49:43.340
 Like everything, all of our mechanisms,

2:49:43.340 --> 2:49:46.380
 everything is made to service the social connections

2:49:46.380 --> 2:49:47.620
 because it's what kept you alive, you know?

2:49:47.620 --> 2:49:49.660
 I mean, you had the, your tribal connections

2:49:49.660 --> 2:49:52.020
 is how you didn't starve during a famine,

2:49:52.020 --> 2:49:54.660
 people would share food, et cetera.

2:49:54.660 --> 2:49:56.180
 And so you can't neglect that.

2:49:56.180 --> 2:49:58.380
 And it's like everything and people feel it, right?

2:49:58.380 --> 2:50:00.020
 Like there's no, our social networks

2:50:00.020 --> 2:50:01.700
 are hooked up to the pain center.

2:50:01.700 --> 2:50:03.940
 That's why it feels so terrible when you miss someone

2:50:03.940 --> 2:50:05.300
 or like someone dies or something, right?

2:50:05.300 --> 2:50:07.660
 That's like how seriously we take it.

2:50:07.660 --> 2:50:09.260
 There's a pretty accepted theory

2:50:09.260 --> 2:50:10.480
 that the default mode network,

2:50:10.480 --> 2:50:12.540
 like a lot of what the default mode network is doing.

2:50:12.540 --> 2:50:14.980
 So that's sort of the default state our brain goes into

2:50:14.980 --> 2:50:16.260
 when we're not doing something in particular

2:50:16.260 --> 2:50:19.540
 is practicing sociality, practicing interactions thing,

2:50:19.540 --> 2:50:22.540
 because it's so crucial to what we do.

2:50:22.540 --> 2:50:25.100
 It's like at the core of human thriving.

2:50:25.100 --> 2:50:26.340
 So I've more recently,

2:50:26.340 --> 2:50:29.260
 the way I think about it is like relationships first.

2:50:29.260 --> 2:50:30.100
 Okay.

2:50:30.100 --> 2:50:31.560
 Given that foundation of putting like,

2:50:31.560 --> 2:50:33.180
 and I don't think we put nearly enough time into it.

2:50:33.180 --> 2:50:36.060
 I worry that social media is reducing relationships,

2:50:36.060 --> 2:50:37.440
 strong relationships.

2:50:37.440 --> 2:50:39.180
 Strong relationships where you're sacrificing

2:50:39.180 --> 2:50:42.860
 non trivial time and attention and resources,

2:50:42.860 --> 2:50:44.600
 whatever on behalf of other people.

2:50:44.600 --> 2:50:46.420
 That's the net that is gonna allow you

2:50:46.420 --> 2:50:48.260
 to get through anything.

2:50:48.260 --> 2:50:50.140
 Then, all right.

2:50:50.140 --> 2:50:53.580
 Now what do we wanna do with the surplus that remains?

2:50:53.580 --> 2:50:55.940
 Maybe I wanna build some fire, build some tools.

2:50:55.940 --> 2:50:57.740
 So put relationships first.

2:50:57.740 --> 2:50:59.300
 I like the worst case analysis

2:50:59.300 --> 2:51:01.220
 from the computer science perspective.

2:51:01.220 --> 2:51:03.420
 Put relationships first.

2:51:03.420 --> 2:51:08.420
 Yeah, because everything else is just assuming average case,

2:51:08.660 --> 2:51:10.740
 assuming things kind of keep going as they were going.

2:51:10.740 --> 2:51:13.420
 And you're neglecting the fundamental human drive.

2:51:13.420 --> 2:51:15.340
 Like we have this, we talked about the boredom instinct.

2:51:15.340 --> 2:51:16.980
 We wanna build things, we wanna have impact,

2:51:16.980 --> 2:51:17.820
 we wanna do productivity.

2:51:17.820 --> 2:51:21.420
 That's not nearly as clear cut of a drive of we need people.

2:51:21.420 --> 2:51:25.620
 But if we look at the real worst case analysis here

2:51:25.620 --> 2:51:28.940
 is one day you're pretty young now,

2:51:28.940 --> 2:51:31.900
 but that's not gonna last very long.

2:51:31.900 --> 2:51:33.100
 You're gonna die one day.

2:51:33.100 --> 2:51:35.260
 Is that something you think about?

2:51:35.260 --> 2:51:36.420
 Little bit.

2:51:36.420 --> 2:51:37.660
 Are you afraid of death?

2:51:37.660 --> 2:51:39.460
 Well, I'm of the mindset of,

2:51:39.460 --> 2:51:41.980
 let's make that a productivity hack.

2:51:41.980 --> 2:51:46.980
 I'm of the mindset of we need to confront that soon.

2:51:47.100 --> 2:51:48.700
 So let's do what we can now

2:51:48.700 --> 2:51:50.660
 so that when we really confront and think about it,

2:51:50.660 --> 2:51:52.780
 we're more likely to feel better about it.

2:51:52.780 --> 2:51:55.860
 So in other words, let's focus now on living

2:51:55.860 --> 2:51:58.660
 and doing things in such a way that we're proud of

2:51:58.660 --> 2:52:00.740
 so that when it really comes time to confront that,

2:52:00.740 --> 2:52:02.780
 we're more likely to say,

2:52:02.780 --> 2:52:05.180
 like, okay, I feel kind of good about the situation.

2:52:05.180 --> 2:52:07.620
 So what, when you're laying on your deathbed,

2:52:07.620 --> 2:52:09.700
 would you, in looking back,

2:52:09.700 --> 2:52:11.060
 what would make you think like,

2:52:11.060 --> 2:52:13.940
 oh, I did okay, I'm proud of that.

2:52:13.940 --> 2:52:15.900
 I optimized the hell out of that.

2:52:15.900 --> 2:52:17.220
 That's a good, I mean, it's a good question

2:52:17.220 --> 2:52:19.940
 to go backwards on.

2:52:19.940 --> 2:52:24.660
 I mean, this is like David Brooks's eulogy virtues

2:52:24.660 --> 2:52:26.860
 versus resume virtues.

2:52:26.860 --> 2:52:28.940
 Right, so his argument is that,

2:52:28.940 --> 2:52:30.740
 and that's another interesting DC area person.

2:52:30.740 --> 2:52:32.980
 I keep thinking of interesting DC area people.

2:52:32.980 --> 2:52:34.540
 All right, David Brooks is here too.

2:52:34.540 --> 2:52:36.220
 Yeah.

2:52:36.220 --> 2:52:38.340
 His argument, he thinks eulogy virtues is,

2:52:38.340 --> 2:52:39.780
 so what we eulogize is different

2:52:39.780 --> 2:52:42.100
 than what we promote on the resume.

2:52:43.020 --> 2:52:44.140
 That's his whole thing now, right?

2:52:44.140 --> 2:52:46.020
 His Suckin Mountain wrote the character.

2:52:46.020 --> 2:52:48.740
 Both these books are, he has this whole premise

2:52:48.740 --> 2:52:50.140
 of there's like this professional phase

2:52:50.140 --> 2:52:53.340
 and there's a phase of giving of yourself

2:52:53.340 --> 2:52:55.740
 and sacrificing on behalf of other people.

2:52:55.740 --> 2:52:57.300
 I don't know, maybe it's all mixed together, right?

2:52:57.300 --> 2:53:00.300
 You wanna, I think living by a code is important, right?

2:53:00.300 --> 2:53:03.180
 I mean, this is something that's not emphasized enough.

2:53:03.180 --> 2:53:05.180
 I always think of advice that my undergrad

2:53:05.180 --> 2:53:06.700
 should be given that they're not given,

2:53:06.700 --> 2:53:07.780
 especially at a place like Georgetown

2:53:07.780 --> 2:53:09.620
 that has this like deep history

2:53:09.620 --> 2:53:11.860
 of trying to promote human flourishing

2:53:11.860 --> 2:53:13.460
 because of the Jesuit connection.

2:53:14.780 --> 2:53:19.340
 There's such resiliency and pride

2:53:19.340 --> 2:53:22.180
 that comes out of living well, even when it's hard,

2:53:22.180 --> 2:53:24.620
 like living according to a code, living accord to,

2:53:24.620 --> 2:53:28.540
 which I think religion used to structure this for people.

2:53:28.540 --> 2:53:30.260
 But in its absence, you need some sort of replacement.

2:53:30.260 --> 2:53:31.860
 But even when things were,

2:53:31.860 --> 2:53:33.540
 soldiers get this a lot, right?

2:53:33.540 --> 2:53:34.380
 They experienced this a lot.

2:53:34.380 --> 2:53:35.220
 Even when things were tough,

2:53:35.220 --> 2:53:36.780
 I was able to persist in living this way

2:53:36.780 --> 2:53:37.620
 that I knew was right,

2:53:37.620 --> 2:53:38.460
 even though it wasn't the easiest thing

2:53:38.460 --> 2:53:39.300
 to do in the moment.

2:53:39.300 --> 2:53:42.100
 Fewer things give humans more resiliency.

2:53:42.100 --> 2:53:43.980
 It's like having done that,

2:53:43.980 --> 2:53:45.700
 your relationships were strong, right?

2:53:45.700 --> 2:53:47.620
 Many people coming to your funeral is a standard.

2:53:47.620 --> 2:53:49.180
 A lot of people are gonna come to your funeral.

2:53:49.180 --> 2:53:51.180
 I mean, you matter to a lot of people.

2:53:51.180 --> 2:53:52.380
 And then maybe having done,

2:53:52.380 --> 2:53:55.660
 to the extent of whatever capabilities

2:53:55.660 --> 2:53:57.900
 you happen to be granted,

2:53:57.900 --> 2:53:59.100
 and they're different for different people,

2:53:59.100 --> 2:54:00.740
 and some people can sprint real fast,

2:54:00.740 --> 2:54:02.860
 and some people can do math problems,

2:54:02.860 --> 2:54:04.820
 try to actually do something of impact.

2:54:06.500 --> 2:54:08.580
 I'll just promise to give gift cards

2:54:08.580 --> 2:54:10.220
 to anybody who shows up to the funeral.

2:54:10.220 --> 2:54:11.060
 You're gonna hack it.

2:54:11.060 --> 2:54:12.900
 I'm gonna hack even the funeral.

2:54:12.900 --> 2:54:14.740
 There's gonna be a lottery wheel you spin

2:54:14.740 --> 2:54:17.940
 when you come in and someone goes away with $10,000.

2:54:17.940 --> 2:54:22.180
 See, the problem is, with all this living by principles,

2:54:22.180 --> 2:54:23.140
 living a principled life,

2:54:23.140 --> 2:54:24.300
 focusing on relationships,

2:54:24.300 --> 2:54:27.780
 and kind of thinking of this life as this perfect thing

2:54:27.780 --> 2:54:30.140
 kind of forgets the notion that none of it

2:54:32.020 --> 2:54:34.220
 makes any sense, right?

2:54:36.220 --> 2:54:40.340
 It kind of implies that this is like a video game

2:54:40.340 --> 2:54:42.420
 and you wanna get a high score,

2:54:42.420 --> 2:54:45.820
 as opposed to none of this even makes sense.

2:54:45.820 --> 2:54:47.980
 Like, why would he, like, what that?

2:54:47.980 --> 2:54:52.660
 Like, what does it even mean to die?

2:54:52.660 --> 2:54:53.700
 It's gonna be over.

2:54:53.700 --> 2:54:57.780
 It's like everything I do, all these productivity hacks,

2:54:57.780 --> 2:55:00.140
 all this life, all these efforts, all this creative efforts,

2:55:00.140 --> 2:55:02.180
 kind of assume it's gonna go on forever.

2:55:02.180 --> 2:55:05.140
 There's a kind of a sense of immortality,

2:55:05.140 --> 2:55:06.660
 and I don't even know how to intellectually

2:55:06.660 --> 2:55:08.380
 make sense that it ends.

2:55:08.380 --> 2:55:10.780
 Of course, gotta ask you in that context,

2:55:10.780 --> 2:55:13.180
 what do you think is the meaning of it all,

2:55:13.180 --> 2:55:14.740
 especially for a computer scientist?

2:55:14.740 --> 2:55:17.380
 I mean, there's gotta be some mathematical.

2:55:17.380 --> 2:55:21.300
 Yeah, 27, or what's the, what's the Douglas Adams?

2:55:21.300 --> 2:55:23.420
 Yeah, or 42, okay.

2:55:23.420 --> 2:55:24.820
 27 is a better number.

2:55:24.820 --> 2:55:26.940
 I should read more sci fi.

2:55:26.940 --> 2:55:28.860
 Maybe you're onto something with a 27.

2:55:28.860 --> 2:55:31.860
 I don't wanna give away too much, but just trust me, 27.

2:55:31.860 --> 2:55:33.180
 It's visible, yeah.

2:55:34.940 --> 2:55:37.060
 So, I mean, I don't know, obviously, right?

2:55:37.060 --> 2:55:38.060
 I mean, I'm a...

2:55:38.060 --> 2:55:38.900
 I was hoping you would.

2:55:38.900 --> 2:55:41.860
 Yeah, I don't know, but going back to what you were saying

2:55:41.860 --> 2:55:43.460
 about the sort of the existentialist,

2:55:43.460 --> 2:55:47.140
 or sort of the more nihilist style approach,

2:55:47.140 --> 2:55:50.460
 the one thing that there is are intimations, right?

2:55:50.460 --> 2:55:53.700
 So that there's these intimations that human halves

2:55:53.700 --> 2:55:56.540
 of somehow this feels right, and this feels wrong,

2:55:56.540 --> 2:55:59.140
 this feels good, this feels like I'm doing,

2:55:59.140 --> 2:56:01.020
 I'm aligned with something, you know,

2:56:01.020 --> 2:56:03.140
 when I'm acting with courage to save, whatever, right?

2:56:03.140 --> 2:56:04.900
 It's not, these intimations

2:56:04.900 --> 2:56:07.180
 are a grounding against arbitrariness.

2:56:07.180 --> 2:56:09.780
 Like, one of the ideas I'm really interested in is that

2:56:11.380 --> 2:56:13.500
 when you look at religion, right?

2:56:13.500 --> 2:56:15.780
 So I'm interested in world religions.

2:56:15.780 --> 2:56:18.300
 My grandfather was like a theologian

2:56:18.300 --> 2:56:19.460
 that studied and wrote all these books,

2:56:19.460 --> 2:56:21.380
 and I'm very interested in this type of stuff.

2:56:21.380 --> 2:56:24.540
 And there's this great book that's,

2:56:24.540 --> 2:56:27.500
 it's not specific to a particular religion,

2:56:27.500 --> 2:56:29.220
 but it's Karen Armstrong wrote this great book

2:56:29.220 --> 2:56:30.820
 called The Case for God.

2:56:30.820 --> 2:56:31.660
 She's very interesting.

2:56:31.660 --> 2:56:34.580
 She was a Catholic nun who sort of left that religion,

2:56:34.580 --> 2:56:36.700
 but one of the smartest thinkers

2:56:37.620 --> 2:56:40.220
 in terms of like accessible theological thinking

2:56:40.220 --> 2:56:42.940
 that's not tied to any particular religion.

2:56:42.940 --> 2:56:45.460
 Her whole argument is that the way to understand religion,

2:56:45.460 --> 2:56:47.540
 first of all, you have to go way back pre enlightenment

2:56:47.540 --> 2:56:48.380
 where all this was formed.

2:56:48.380 --> 2:56:50.220
 We got messed up thinking about religion

2:56:50.220 --> 2:56:51.300
 post enlightenment, right?

2:56:51.300 --> 2:56:54.660
 And these were operating systems

2:56:54.660 --> 2:56:56.260
 for making sense of intimations.

2:56:57.620 --> 2:57:00.220
 The one thing we had were these different intimations

2:57:00.220 --> 2:57:03.700
 of this field, like awe and mystical experience.

2:57:03.700 --> 2:57:05.860
 And this feels, there's something you feel

2:57:05.860 --> 2:57:07.140
 when you act in a certain way

2:57:07.140 --> 2:57:08.700
 and don't act in this other way.

2:57:08.700 --> 2:57:11.900
 And it was like the scientists who were trying to study

2:57:11.900 --> 2:57:13.460
 and understand the model of the atom

2:57:13.460 --> 2:57:15.900
 by just looking at experiments and trying to understand

2:57:15.900 --> 2:57:16.740
 what's going on.

2:57:16.740 --> 2:57:18.260
 Like the great religions of the world

2:57:18.260 --> 2:57:19.780
 were basically figuring out

2:57:19.780 --> 2:57:21.300
 how do we make sense of these intimations

2:57:21.300 --> 2:57:22.940
 and live in alignment with them

2:57:22.940 --> 2:57:24.860
 and build a life of meaning around that.

2:57:24.860 --> 2:57:26.180
 What were the tools they were using?

2:57:26.180 --> 2:57:27.140
 They were using ritual.

2:57:27.140 --> 2:57:28.100
 They were using belief.

2:57:28.100 --> 2:57:31.060
 They were using action, but all of it was like an OS.

2:57:31.060 --> 2:57:34.740
 It was like a liturgical model of the atom that did.

2:57:34.740 --> 2:57:35.860
 It's hard coded in.

2:57:35.860 --> 2:57:39.060
 So it did through the evolutionary process.

2:57:39.060 --> 2:57:41.340
 I mean, they wouldn't have called it that back then

2:57:41.340 --> 2:57:45.220
 or yeah, I mean, they didn't have that as pre enlightenment.

2:57:45.220 --> 2:57:46.860
 They just said, this is here.

2:57:46.860 --> 2:57:50.820
 And the directive is to try to live in alignment with that.

2:57:50.820 --> 2:57:53.340
 Well, then I want to ask who wrote the original code.

2:57:53.340 --> 2:57:56.700
 Yeah, so Armstrong lays out this good argument

2:57:56.700 --> 2:57:58.140
 and where it gets really interesting

2:57:58.140 --> 2:58:01.020
 is that she emphasizes that all of this

2:58:01.020 --> 2:58:03.140
 was considered ineffable, right?

2:58:03.140 --> 2:58:05.220
 So the whole notion, and this is like rich

2:58:05.220 --> 2:58:06.420
 in Jewish tradition in particular

2:58:06.420 --> 2:58:08.100
 and also in Islamic tradition,

2:58:08.100 --> 2:58:11.100
 we can't comprehend and understand what's going on here.

2:58:11.100 --> 2:58:11.940
 Right?

2:58:11.940 --> 2:58:13.900
 And so the best we can do to approximate understanding

2:58:13.900 --> 2:58:16.900
 and live in alignment is we act as if this is true,

2:58:16.900 --> 2:58:19.860
 do these rituals, have these actions or whatever.

2:58:19.860 --> 2:58:21.700
 Post enlightenment, a lot of that got,

2:58:22.620 --> 2:58:24.780
 once we learned about enlightenment,

2:58:24.780 --> 2:58:26.620
 we grew these suspicions around religion

2:58:26.620 --> 2:58:28.740
 that are very much of the modern era, right?

2:58:28.740 --> 2:58:30.740
 So like the Karen Armstrong,

2:58:30.740 --> 2:58:33.820
 like Sam Harris's critique of religion makes no sense.

2:58:33.820 --> 2:58:34.660
 Right?

2:58:34.660 --> 2:58:35.980
 The critique's based on, well, this is,

2:58:35.980 --> 2:58:37.580
 you're making the ascent to propositions

2:58:37.580 --> 2:58:39.340
 that you think are true for which you do not have evidence

2:58:39.340 --> 2:58:40.180
 that they are true.

2:58:40.180 --> 2:58:41.580
 That's an enlightenment thing, right?

2:58:41.580 --> 2:58:43.740
 This is not the context and this is not,

2:58:43.740 --> 2:58:46.820
 the religion is the Rutherford model of the atom.

2:58:46.820 --> 2:58:50.380
 Like it's not actually maybe what is underneath happening,

2:58:50.380 --> 2:58:52.740
 but this model explains why your chemical equations work.

2:58:52.740 --> 2:58:55.060
 And so this is like the way religion was.

2:58:55.060 --> 2:58:57.220
 There's a God, we'll call it this, this is how it works,

2:58:57.220 --> 2:58:58.620
 we do this ritual, we act in this way,

2:58:58.620 --> 2:59:00.820
 it aligns with it, just like the model of the atom

2:59:00.820 --> 2:59:03.660
 predicted why NA and CL is gonna become salt,

2:59:03.660 --> 2:59:05.020
 this predicts that you're gonna feel

2:59:05.020 --> 2:59:06.100
 and live in alignment, right?

2:59:06.100 --> 2:59:08.380
 It's like this beautiful sophisticated theory,

2:59:08.380 --> 2:59:11.100
 which actually matches how a lot of great theologians

2:59:11.100 --> 2:59:13.580
 have thought about it.

2:59:13.580 --> 2:59:14.900
 But then when you come forward in time,

2:59:14.900 --> 2:59:15.860
 yeah, maybe it's evolution.

2:59:15.860 --> 2:59:18.420
 I mean, this is like what Peterson hints at, right?

2:59:18.420 --> 2:59:23.420
 Like he's basically, he doesn't like to get super pinned down

2:59:24.260 --> 2:59:27.300
 on this, but it kind of seems where he sees it that way.

2:59:27.300 --> 2:59:29.140
 He's almost like searching for the words.

2:59:29.140 --> 2:59:31.020
 He focuses more on like Jung and other people,

2:59:31.020 --> 2:59:32.900
 but I mean, I know he's very Jungian,

2:59:32.900 --> 2:59:35.820
 but that same type of analysis, I think, roughly speaking,

2:59:35.820 --> 2:59:38.540
 like Armstrong is sort of a, it's kind of like a Peter

2:59:38.540 --> 2:59:41.940
 Sony analysis, but she's looking more at the deep history

2:59:41.940 --> 2:59:45.980
 of religion than, but yeah, he throws in an evolutionary.

2:59:45.980 --> 2:59:48.500
 Yeah, and I wonder what home it finds,

2:59:48.500 --> 2:59:51.860
 I wonder what the new home is if religion dissipates

2:59:51.860 --> 2:59:54.060
 and what the new home for these kinds of

2:59:54.060 --> 2:59:58.180
 natural inclinations are, whether it's technology,

2:59:58.180 --> 2:59:59.020
 whether...

2:59:59.020 --> 3:00:00.900
 And if it's evolution, I mean, this is Francis Collins's

3:00:00.900 --> 3:00:04.420
 book also, he's like, well, that's a religious,

3:00:04.420 --> 3:00:06.500
 that could be a very religious notion.

3:00:06.500 --> 3:00:07.580
 I don't, I think this stuff is interesting.

3:00:07.580 --> 3:00:08.740
 I'm not a very religious person,

3:00:08.740 --> 3:00:11.940
 but I'm thinking it's not a bad idea.

3:00:11.940 --> 3:00:14.540
 Maybe what replaces, honestly, like maybe what replaces

3:00:14.540 --> 3:00:17.260
 religion is a return to religion,

3:00:17.260 --> 3:00:20.060
 but in this sort of more sophisticated...

3:00:20.060 --> 3:00:22.460
 I mean, if you went back, yeah, I mean, it's the issue

3:00:22.460 --> 3:00:24.860
 with like a lot of the recent critiques,

3:00:24.860 --> 3:00:29.660
 I think it's a strong critique in a complicated way, right?

3:00:29.660 --> 3:00:32.380
 Because the whole way these, the way this works,

3:00:32.380 --> 3:00:34.420
 I mean, the theologians, if you're reading Paul Tillich,

3:00:34.420 --> 3:00:36.940
 if you're reading Heschel, if you're reading these people,

3:00:36.940 --> 3:00:39.260
 they're thinking very sophisticatedly about religion

3:00:39.260 --> 3:00:40.780
 in terms of this, it's ineffable,

3:00:40.780 --> 3:00:43.580
 and we're just these things, and it connects us

3:00:43.580 --> 3:00:46.020
 to these things in a way that puts life in alignment.

3:00:46.020 --> 3:00:47.180
 We can't really explain what's going on

3:00:47.180 --> 3:00:50.020
 because our brains can't handle it, right?

3:00:50.020 --> 3:00:53.740
 For the average person though, this notion of live as if

3:00:53.740 --> 3:00:57.620
 is kind of how religions work, is live as if this is true.

3:00:57.620 --> 3:01:00.140
 It's like an OS for getting in alignment with,

3:01:00.140 --> 3:01:02.780
 because through cultural evolution,

3:01:02.780 --> 3:01:04.220
 like you behave in this way, do these words,

3:01:04.220 --> 3:01:07.780
 live as if this is true gives you

3:01:07.780 --> 3:01:10.140
 the goal you're looking for.

3:01:10.140 --> 3:01:12.380
 But that's a complicated thing, live as if this is true,

3:01:12.380 --> 3:01:15.020
 because if you, especially if you're not a theologian,

3:01:15.020 --> 3:01:18.620
 to say, yeah, this is not true in an enlightenment sense,

3:01:18.620 --> 3:01:21.420
 but I'm living as if, it kind of takes the heat out of it,

3:01:21.420 --> 3:01:22.820
 but of course it's what people are doing

3:01:22.820 --> 3:01:25.660
 because highly religious people still do bad things,

3:01:25.660 --> 3:01:28.380
 where if you really were, there's absolutely a hell

3:01:28.380 --> 3:01:30.100
 and I'm definitely gonna go to it if I do this bad thing,

3:01:30.100 --> 3:01:31.980
 you would never have, you know,

3:01:31.980 --> 3:01:33.180
 no one would ever murder anyone

3:01:33.180 --> 3:01:34.800
 if they were an evangelical Christian, right?

3:01:34.800 --> 3:01:37.420
 So it's like what, this is kind of a tangent

3:01:37.420 --> 3:01:39.580
 that I'm on shaky ground here,

3:01:39.580 --> 3:01:43.340
 but it's something I've been interested off and on a lot.

3:01:43.340 --> 3:01:44.500
 Well, it's fascinating, I mean,

3:01:44.500 --> 3:01:46.620
 I think we're in some sense searching for,

3:01:46.620 --> 3:01:48.700
 because it does make for a good operating system,

3:01:48.700 --> 3:01:52.080
 we're searching for a good live as if X is true

3:01:52.080 --> 3:01:54.300
 and we're searching for a new X.

3:01:54.300 --> 3:01:58.820
 And maybe artificial intelligence will be the very,

3:01:58.820 --> 3:02:02.540
 the new gods that we're so desperately looking for.

3:02:02.540 --> 3:02:04.000
 Or it'll just spit out 42.

3:02:04.960 --> 3:02:06.420
 I thought it was 27.

3:02:06.420 --> 3:02:09.820
 Cal, this is, as you know, I've been a huge fan,

3:02:10.780 --> 3:02:14.700
 so are a huge number of people that I've spoken with,

3:02:14.700 --> 3:02:15.980
 so they've been telling me,

3:02:15.980 --> 3:02:18.380
 I absolutely have to talk to you, this is a huge honor,

3:02:18.380 --> 3:02:20.700
 this is really fun, thanks for wasting all this time with me.

3:02:20.700 --> 3:02:22.440
 Yeah, no, likewise, man, I've been a long time fan,

3:02:22.440 --> 3:02:23.520
 so this was a lot of fun.

3:02:23.520 --> 3:02:24.440
 Yeah, thanks, man.

3:02:25.440 --> 3:02:28.140
